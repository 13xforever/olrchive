2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Orange Lounge may contain hot monkey sex.

3
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Just kidding, Orange Lounge will not contain hot monkey sex.

4
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
In this episode...

5
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Hey, are any girls down there?

00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
What's your favorite scary movie?

Showgirls. Absolutely frightening.

9
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
What's yours?

00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
There are no stupid questions, just stupid people.

11
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Don't torture yourself. That's my job.

15
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I'm sorry, but all questions must be submitted in writing.

16
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Why did they have to take the word gay?

17
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
No! What I expect for punishing positions is Hindu.

18
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000

Come on, girls, it's time to drop the bomb.

24
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I can't, for the life of me, get the hooker to have sex with me.

25
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
What kind of warped human being would find that funny?

He's the Matt. He's THE Matt.

46

A star is born here on Orange Lounge Radio.

160
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:53,220
You say that every fucking time.

161
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:56,460
I know, that's why I have to say it, because Dave pointed that out one day.

162
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:59,900
You say that every goddamn time you play it, bro!

163
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:01,900
I didn't say it in that tone, though.

164
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:05,420
Well, I make things up on this show.

165
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:12,420
My best example of singing is the most fabulous, wonderful, ideal of suck I've ever heard.

166
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:17,420
We're re-bringing that promo back because American Idol is back.

00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:20,420
So we have to play that promo again more.

00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:29,420
We're going to start off with the match game first thing here tonight, but we're going to need to get some contestants.

178
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:46,540
This is a question.

179
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:48,740
It's actually a trivia question about myself.

180
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:49,740
Okay.

181
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:50,740
Alright.

182
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:51,740
What is the one beverage...

183
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:52,740
No.

184
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:53,740
I can't do that.

185
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:55,740
I can't do that.

186
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:57,140
Okay.

187
00:12:57,140 --> 00:12:59,640
First two people with the correct answer are our contestants tonight.

188
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:01,640
What is Jamie's favorite tax song?

189
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:04,940
Ooh, that's going to be a hard one, don't you think?

190
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:05,940
If they pay attention, you think?

191
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:06,940
If they pay attention, they'll get it.

192
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:10,340
Alright, Jamie's favorite tax song.

193
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:13,260
Send it to me over private message.

194
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:16,300
And the first two people who got it right get to participate tonight.

195
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:20,460
So in the meantime, while we wait for those answers to come in, what do we want to talk

196
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:21,460
about?

197
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:23,460
Oh yes, let's talk about the contest.

198
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:24,460
Yes.

199
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:26,620
First of all, what inspired the pre-show that we did tonight?

200
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:29,100
I ran out of ideas.

201
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:33,740
So, for those that just joined us and missed the pre-show, tell us what we did tonight.

202
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:35,620
Um, old TV show theme songs.

203
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:41,720
Old TV show theme songs. Many of which that were donated by DDR Angel and Stracer. Next week you should play Eurobeat.

204
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:44,000
Yes, I will. Eurobeat.

205
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,620
Go! Beat beat.

206
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:46,940
Off a song!

207
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:51,780
I'll just play the whole Parapara soundtrack. How's that sound? Like, all music from Initial D.

208
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:54,780
Okay, I lost all 17 of my Initial D soundtracks.

209
00:13:54,780 --> 00:13:57,780
Okay, next time Jamie takes a week off, you can do pre-show.

210
00:13:57,780 --> 00:13:58,780
How's that, Matt?

211
00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:00,780
Am I gonna take a week off?

212
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:01,780
Thank you.

213
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:02,780
That's beautiful.

214
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:03,780
Okay, um...

215
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:06,780
No, no, next week's pre-show is Strong Bad Things.

216
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:09,780
Okay, um, so let me think.

217
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:10,780
Uh, what else?

218
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:11,780
The contest!

219
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:12,780
The contest!

220
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:13,780
So, great idea.

221
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:16,780
We have to, uh, give Mitch thanks to Dark Tetsuya for this idea.

222
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:17,780
This is a great idea.

223
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:25,780
Orange Lounge Radio is going to be hosting our own DWI contest, because we're going to do this right, god damn it, we're going to do a DWI contest and it's going to kick ass.

224
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:39,780
And the theme is, you have to do a DWI complete with backgrounds, basic trick and maniac steps, and banners, the whole nine yards, to any old TV theme.

225
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:45,780
Or actually no, any TV theme you want to do. Two minutes at the most, if it's longer than two minutes you better crop it down.

226
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:49,700
any TV theme you want to do a DUI to send that in

227
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:53,140

00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:20,420
Oh, you got your site too!

238
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:20,920
Hello!

239
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,420
Well, okay, you're the host of our DWI's.

240
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:23,420
Way to go!

241
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:27,420
I still want more promotion. Let's see if we can get Cali Bimani to go in on this with us.

242
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:29,420
A joint contest here.

243
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:33,420
More promotion. But you will host all the DWI files on the new Leech from Loki site.

244
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:35,420
My new Leech from Loki site that's...

245
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:37,420
Oh yeah, I need to finish that.

246
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:39,920
Okay. Okay, I get a yes.

247
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:40,920
Okay, so this is it.

248
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:46,280
The Calibomani.com slash Orange Launch Radio DWI contest must be TV theme song.

249
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:48,440
Deadline, when do we want them done by?

250
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:54,280
Uh, we need a tentative deadline right now so we can iron out all the rules and shit.

251
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:55,280
Uh huh?

252
00:15:55,280 --> 00:16:01,120
You need to, um, iron out, you know, what the rules and stuff would be.

253
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:06,440
Okay, so we'll just tell everybody they're going to have to look on the forums for the

254
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:07,440
information.

255
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,960
Okay, American, Canadian, or British.

256
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:12,980
So this is the deal.

257
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:15,400
We don't know how we want to submit these yet, but that's okay.

258
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:19,200
Just go work on them and we'll have more details for you next week.

259
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:23,340
Next week's show, by the way, Jamie's going to be here, and Loki, you're going to be here

260
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:24,340
too next week.

261
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:25,340
I will not.

262
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:26,340
I will.

263
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:29,540
I'm going to be in L.A. at the Cyberbeat tournament.

264
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:30,540
I'll set it all up.

265
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:34,240
I've already got a way where they can send the files to me.

266
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:37,620
So we'll set something up and we'll have more information for you next week.

267
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:44,360
And if anyone still remembers leechfromloki.tk, do not go there, because that is the most

268
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:47,620
disturbing picture I've ever seen in my entire life.

269
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:48,620
Actually...

270
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:49,620
Yeah, whatever, blah blah blah.

271
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:50,620
We'll talk about it later.

272
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:51,620
That was funny though, but yeah.

273
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:52,620
Yeah, whatever.

274
00:16:52,620 --> 00:17:00,440
Anyway, but the correct address for Loki's site is www.willddrforfood.net slash leechfromloki.

275
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:06,040
So anyway, so now you know, we're doing a DWI contest, and the judges will be, of course,

276
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:09,080
myself, Jamie and Loki.

277
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:10,120
That sound good?

278
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:10,920
That's because we're cool.

279
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:15,920
And maybe we'll get... We're cooler than everybody in the world! We'll get an Aoki or somebody from Cali Bumani to judge to.

280
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:18,220
We'll get a fourth judge from them.

281
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:22,840
And yes, the site's not done yet. Yes, I know, I promised to have the site done about a month ago or two

282
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:25,200
months ago. I don't even care anymore.

283
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,800
I'm just lazy

284
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:31,360
and I'm not doing it right away because it's a lot of fucking work and I need...

285
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:33,160
Yeah, it's just like...

286
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:36,520
It's tedious and I get distracted easily and

287
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:40,160
just insert excuse here.

288
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:43,960
Evil Naoki says he's judging, so that's it, that's our fourth judge, Evil Naoki, we got it.

289
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:47,200
Alright, so, beautiful. More details to come on that.

290
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:50,780

292
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:58,960
No. No, he's not. Okay, so Dark Tetsuya, you can resend us another one if you want.

00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:25,780
No, we're going to burp.

328
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:26,780
And there'll be a blanket.

329
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:29,780
And the contestants tonight, Black Lab and the O.S.F.B.B.

330
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:30,780
This is a matching blanket.

331
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:32,780
Will have to try to fill in that blank.

332
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:33,780
Blanket.

333
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:35,780

00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:36,780
Blanket.

A pointy blanket.

337
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:40,780
A few things you should know about the celebrities.

338
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:43,780
You already know myself, Jamie, and Loki pretty well.

339
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:46,880

341
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:59,200

00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:09,580
Britney. If anybody can guess his favorite DDR song they get nothing yes

343
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:15,580
Zero, I don't know. Zero's kind of a wild card. What will your answers be like, Zero?

344
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:17,580
I don't know. They'll just be whatever they want.

345
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:19,580
They'll be the right ones. Okay.

346
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:21,580
Yeah, they'll all be right.

347
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:26,580
And then Brad and Dave are both very crazy, so their answers will be crazy.

348
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:30,580
They're crazy people.

349
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:33,580
All right. First question.

350
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:34,580
Okay, okay.

351
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:36,580
We haven't done this in a while, so here we go.

352
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:43,080
First question, Ted the Terrorizer loved to make fun of people that played DDR.

353
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:44,080
You misspelled terrorizer.

354
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:46,580
Shh, they don't know that, it's radio.

355
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:49,580
Here, look, I'll right click and do spell check right now. Here we go.

356
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:51,080
He said it in an R.

357
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:54,080
Terrorized, Ted the Terrorizer.

358
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:56,580
Okay, Ted the Terrorizer, dammit.

359
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:58,580
It doesn't matter.

360
00:21:58,580 --> 00:22:00,080
Can I ask a question?

361
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:03,580
Ted the Terrorizer loved to make fun of people that played DDR.

362
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:07,580
He liked to yell to the goofy people, stopping on the game.

363
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:14,580
Hey! Stop stomping on the arrows and go blank!

364
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:39,120
Hey, stop stomping on the arrows and go blank.

365
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:40,120

00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:41,120
Write it down.

367
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:42,120
What's the first thing?

368
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:43,120

372
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:10,800

That's the obvious one, nobody gets that.

Stop stomping on the arrows and go...

403

Or yourself.

406
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:53,200
You braindead redneck asshole.

407
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,840
Stop stomping on the arrows and go fuck a sheep.

408
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:58,880
your sister or yourself, you brain dead redneck asshole.

409
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:02,200
No, I'm sorry, that was not a match, but it was funny.

410
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,180
My answer.

411
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:08,560
My answer, hey, stop stomping on the arrows

412
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:11,100
and go shove a bottle of Propel up your ass.

413
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:17,680
That's a very good observation, Brad.

414
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:20,040
They all have to do with penetration of some sort.

415
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:23,780
Billy's is implied though.

416
00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:26,780
Just because you're gay, you don't have to fuck me.

417
00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:29,780
Yeah, that's right. Just because you're gay doesn't mean you have to fuck people in the ass.

418
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:32,780
Yeah, I think that you can be gay and not a slut.

419
00:25:37,780 --> 00:25:38,780
Alright.

420
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:40,780
This is an ear party.

421
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:42,780
Alright, so.

422
00:25:42,780 --> 00:25:45,780
So sorry, kids. No points.

423
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:48,780
The score is all tied up with a big fat zero. Next question.

424
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:50,780
There's no winners except me.

425
00:25:50,780 --> 00:25:52,780
Next question, here we go.

426
00:25:52,780 --> 00:25:59,780
There we go. JB the Jenny Rom Whore, and for those that don't know who Jenny Rom is, Waka

427
00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:06,780
Laka, the Waka Laka song. Or Blonde Girl, it'd be a blonde girl. Ok, that's Jenny Rom.

428
00:26:06,780 --> 00:26:13,780
Or Senorita. Ok, here we go. JB the Jenny Rom Whore loved to order things from PsyFam,

429
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:18,780
that's the record label that puts that on the stuff. He gasped in horror one day, though,

430
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:24,860
Sifam didn't send him the album they had he had ordered instead they had sent him a CD of blank

431
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:32,540
JB the Jenny Rom whore loved to order things from Jenny's record company

432
00:26:32,540 --> 00:26:36,540
He gasped in horror one day, though, when he didn't get the album he had ordered. Instead,

433
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:57,060
they had sent him a CD of blank.

434
00:26:57,060 --> 00:27:02,520
I'm waiting for both contestants. All right. JB gasped in horror when he did not get the

435
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:10,160
the album he had ordered, instead they sent him a CD of blank. Alright, do we have all

00:27:57,260 --> 00:27:58,260
Okay.

444
00:27:58,260 --> 00:28:00,260
WTF? Okay.

00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:02,260
Alrighty.

447
00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:04,260
Kids Bop Max.

448
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:06,260
You know what Kids Bop Max is, Billy?

449
00:28:08,260 --> 00:28:12,260
Billy, of course, Billy the fag with no Kids Bop Max.

450
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:18,260
Does that mean you suck dick, too? Jesus.

451
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:22,260
No, it's on Nickelodeon, man, and I watch Invader Zim ass.

452
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:26,260
Are you a racist? Do you like to suck cock?

453
00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:30,260
Why do you think I don't watch TV?

454
00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:34,260
Okay, my turn.

455
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:38,260
Starting off

456
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:42,260
with Dark Sakura. JB was shocked when he got a CD of

457
00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:46,260
Yoko Ono's Greatest Hits.

458
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:50,260
Good answer, but not a match. I'm sorry to say.

459
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:57,260
It was giving me glares for insinuating that he was a homo for knowing about Kidz Bop.

460
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:05,260
Anyways, so he was shocked to see the CD that he got because...

461
00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:10,260
It doesn't matter because Jenny Rom sucks, okay?

462
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:14,260
Ooh, you can send those cards and letters to Loki!

463
00:29:14,260 --> 00:29:18,260
Care of willdyrforfood.net slash leash from Loki.

464
00:29:18,260 --> 00:29:25,260
Billy, he was shocked to see that they sent him a CD of The Original Artists.

465
00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:33,260
Oh, I think Billy gets a zing for that. The Original Artists.

466
00:29:36,260 --> 00:29:43,260
That was funny. Alright, but not a match. Good answer, though.

467
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:57,260
Alright, but not a match. Good answer though. Zero. He was shocked to see that they set him a CD of the best and worst of American Idol, which is pretty much the same.

468
00:29:57,260 --> 00:30:04,260
Good answer, not a match. Sorry. Our dynamic duo over here, Brad and Dave.

469
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:05,260
shocked

470
00:30:05,260 --> 00:30:08,420

471
00:30:08,420 --> 00:30:12,300

472
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:19,300
Rafi

473
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:26,140
he used to sing children's songs on stage

474
00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:27,420
no the elephant show

475
00:30:27,420 --> 00:30:28,660

476
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:29,620

477
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:32,620
banana phone

478
00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:34,620
No, there isn't.

479
00:30:34,620 --> 00:30:35,620
Oh, never mind.

480
00:30:35,620 --> 00:30:37,620
I mean, it's Rafi though, dang.

481
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:40,620
You guys won the match game just for that alone.

482
00:30:40,620 --> 00:30:42,620
All right.

483
00:30:42,620 --> 00:30:46,620
My answer, my answer actually has a musical cue to go with it.

484
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:51,620
He was shocked to see that they sent him a CD of Avril Lavigne's speed covers.

485
00:30:51,620 --> 00:30:58,620
I'm gonna go kill myself now, bye.

486
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:07,460
There's a bottle of Propel you can choke on.

487
00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:11,460
Okay. You were shocked to see the Cinema CD of Avril Lavigne's newcomers.

488
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:14,260
Rob, put it right in your hand.

489
00:31:14,260 --> 00:31:17,900
I got slapped on the wrist for that one.

490
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:19,620
Alright.

491
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:23,620
Okay, you lose. You are loser!

492
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:28,620
So it's all tied up, 0-0.

493
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:32,620
Alright, next question, here we go.

494
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:35,620
Let's see if we can get one on the board here.

495
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:40,620
Jamie loves Propel more than any drink in the whole world.

496
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:44,620
She decided though one day to write the company and tell them,

497
00:31:44,620 --> 00:31:49,620
Dear Propel, you really need to make blank flavor.

498
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:58,620
People who know what my favorite drink is don't get it.

499
00:31:58,620 --> 00:32:02,620
Should I ask that joke?

500
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:04,620
Yes, I like ass flavor.

501
00:32:04,620 --> 00:32:12,620
Thank you.

502
00:32:12,620 --> 00:32:16,620
We're waiting for the contestants to lock in. Are all the celebrities in?

503
00:32:16,620 --> 00:32:18,620
Oh, they're singing.

504
00:32:18,620 --> 00:32:21,620
Okay, dear Propel, you really need to make blank flavor.

505
00:32:24,620 --> 00:32:26,620
Actually, that makes me think of...

506
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:29,620
And today's contestants take home...

507
00:32:29,620 --> 00:32:31,620
Rice-a-roni, the San Francisco treat.

508
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:32,620
Ding ding!

509
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:34,620
Rice-a-roni, the San Francisco treat.

510
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:37,620
Alright, our contestants are locked in. How about the celebrities?

511
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:38,620
Still thinking?

512
00:32:38,620 --> 00:32:41,620
Just think, what's a flavor of Propel that Jamie would want?

513
00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:48,620
Okay, we're still waiting on a couple of liberties. Zero's writing. Billy, come on.

514
00:32:51,620 --> 00:32:55,620
I should answer that.

515
00:32:55,620 --> 00:32:58,620
Okay, we'll have Jamie answer that.

516
00:32:58,620 --> 00:33:04,620
I'll let you try my turn, because I'm the best, the greatest, and everyone loves me.

517
00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:06,620
The chat room has a lot of good answers here.

518
00:33:06,620 --> 00:33:07,620
Like what?

519
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:08,620
it?

520
00:33:08,620 --> 00:33:09,620
Uh, bukkake.

521
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:10,620
No!

522
00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:11,620
S'woon cream.

523
00:33:11,620 --> 00:33:12,620
Sort of salty.

524
00:33:12,620 --> 00:33:13,620
School girl.

525
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:14,620
Probably like sweaty palms.

526
00:33:14,620 --> 00:33:15,620
School girl flavor.

527
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:16,620
Okay.

528
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:17,620
Billy's locked in.

529
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:18,620
Good.

530
00:33:18,620 --> 00:33:19,620
Alright.

531
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:20,620
Okay.

532
00:33:20,620 --> 00:33:21,620
Let's read the answers.

533
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:22,620
First, EOSFBB.

534
00:33:22,620 --> 00:33:33,620
EOSFBB goes first this time.

535
00:33:33,620 --> 00:33:34,780
first this time

536
00:33:34,780 --> 00:33:36,700
dear propel you really need to make

537
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:39,500
ass flavor

538
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:41,420
ass flavor beautiful

539
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:44,700
black lapd says dear propel you really need to make

540
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:46,360
tak flavor

541
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:49,420
uh... very good tak flavor good answer

542
00:33:49,420 --> 00:33:52,440
also matched with angel and dark tetsuya

543
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:56,740
both said that in the chat room at different points but you don't get a point for them

544
00:33:56,740 --> 00:34:01,220
and uh... ohayo bemani makes a good point lemon flavored is ass flavored

545
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:03,160
yes

546
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:07,240
okay here we go let's see so jamie you are going to go first and this would be

547
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:10,240
the correct answer hypothetically

548
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:13,600
as much as i enjoyed the thought of tax-flavored pocari

549
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:15,240
my answer is pocari sweat

550
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:19,520
uh... pocari sweat flavored okay good good

551
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:24,080
you know it's actually going to be mentioned in my puppy of the week later on

552
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:28,560
all right moving on loki

553
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:35,360
I had Blood of a Virgin on there as a flavor, but I'm just going Vanilla Coke flavor.

554
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:40,860
I'm sorry, Blood of a Virgin wouldn't be good because I don't want to do that in your tent.

555
00:34:40,860 --> 00:34:45,360
All right, so we had Vanilla Coke flavor.

556
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:47,060
That's not a bad answer, not a bad answer.

557
00:34:47,060 --> 00:34:48,060
All right, Billy.

558
00:34:48,060 --> 00:34:49,560
Cream of Sung Young Guy.

559
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:52,260
Cream of Sung Young Guy flavor.

560
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:54,460
Good answer, but not a match, sorry.

561
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:56,260
All right, zero.

562
00:34:56,260 --> 00:35:01,260
sadly enough i did write ass

563
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:04,020
wait did Billy say some young guy or some

564
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:09,140
i thought it was like some young guy is that some japanese food or something

565
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:10,660
no i just

566
00:35:10,660 --> 00:35:12,260
no i have seen it

567
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:14,460
i didn't comment on that

568
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:16,020
okay

569
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:18,380
i want to say what?

570
00:35:18,380 --> 00:35:20,060
as he just says what?

571
00:35:20,060 --> 00:35:23,100
as he just says what?

572
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:24,100
exactly

573
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:25,420
okay uh...

574
00:35:25,420 --> 00:35:30,620
ours was ochre

575
00:35:30,620 --> 00:35:32,780
uh...

576
00:35:32,780 --> 00:35:34,220
uh... okay

577
00:35:34,220 --> 00:35:37,820
and my answer because i guess that you need a lot of it was huge or maybe

578
00:35:37,820 --> 00:35:40,860
shorter review if i could be flavored

579
00:35:40,860 --> 00:35:43,760
i never had never a day

580
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:46,800
although what i would

581
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,820
and i want to make my hand

582
00:35:48,820 --> 00:35:49,960
and then it's with it

583
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:52,500
later i don't know when it dries right here

584
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:59,500
and then i would go to people and feel it back

585
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:04,440
all right

586
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:08,440
so we had a point we did get finally one point two yes so you know that he

587
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:12,240
basically by one point

588
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:14,200
okay

589
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:18,220
it's not about being right it's about the money okay

590
00:36:18,220 --> 00:36:20,180
that right

591
00:36:20,180 --> 00:36:21,460

ability though

625
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:20,040
Okay, Billy, now this would be the correct answer, supposedly, in a perfect world.

626
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:21,000
Billy, what should they do?

627
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:24,320
Answer any Kylie song here.

628
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:29,520
If you knew Billy, you knew, just go with Kylie Minogue. That's all you had to do. Now, this is the funny thing.

629
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:35,520
Kylie Minogue shows up on all those Dance Mania albums, but they have not put her in DDR yet.

630
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:36,880

644
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:20,880
Dolphin Cry.

645
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:22,880
It's a sexual position, isn't it?

646
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:26,880
No, it's something I do when I stick with the button.

647
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:28,880
hahahahahahahaha

648
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:30,880

I said um

656
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:46,880
my answer was

657
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:48,880
Billy the big homosexual loved to play Game of Monet songs

658
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:50,880
he really wished they would put

659
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:52,880
more para songs into D.R.

660
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:54,880
hahahahaha

661
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:58,880
More part of our songs, unfortunately, not a match.

662
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:01,880
Shine loose to both our contestants.

663
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:02,880

00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:04,880

673
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:54,160
show Jamie is going to get so drunk that she ends up blank.

674
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:29,160
Why did I put this question in there? This is a hard one.

675
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:34,160
What?

676
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:39,160
What?

677
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:44,160
Alright.

678
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:49,160
Oh, the contestants aren't locked in yet.

679
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:51,520
Oh, the contestants aren't locked in yet.

680
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:52,920

00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:56,420

00:41:56,420 --> 00:41:58,280

683
00:41:58,280 --> 00:41:59,280
We're waiting on the contestants.

684
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:00,840
All the celebrities are in?

685
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:01,680
All right.

686
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:03,280
We're just waiting for the two contestants.

687
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:05,080
Any day now, you two.

688
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:05,920
One's in.

689
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:11,320
Waiting on one more contestant.

690
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:15,600
Are you rating your Ray-Par light around?

691
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:19,600
I wonder if we're getting a big, long paragraph or something.

692
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:23,600
Jamie knows it's all in good fun.

693
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:27,600
But she reserves the right to cut you.

694
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:31,600
Alright, here we go. Here we go.

695
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:35,600
We'll start off with the person in the lead. We predict on next week's Drunk Show,

696
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:39,600
EOSFBB says Jamie is going to get so drunk that she ends up

697
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:43,600
lesbian.

698
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:46,240
blinks

699
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:49,440
blacklabs

700
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:52,080
blacklabs also says lesbian

701
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:56,340
she's gonna get so drunk she ends up lesbian

702
00:42:56,340 --> 00:42:59,720
is that because we all get gay when we drink?

703
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:02,040
do i go straight when i drink?

704
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:03,440
actually i kinda do

705
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:10,440
okay don't you people know that i already have made the vow that if Dan and i ever break up i'm getting a girlfriend?

706
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:17,440
I just don't find that anything about that is funny.

707
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:30,880
Because men love lesbians. Jamie is going to get so drunk she ends up sane, that's a

708
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:34,440
and that's a good answer

709
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:37,680
uh... next up looking she ends up

710
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:41,700
might go

711
00:43:41,700 --> 00:43:43,400
i said let me do it

712
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:45,440
i think that's why

713
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:47,360
they get a point

714
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:49,080
to that

715
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:53,560
the answer to say thank you are a

716
00:43:53,560 --> 00:43:58,560
belly she ends up

717
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:00,560
Good answer. Zero. She ends up...

718
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:04,560
I thought I was going to be original with this, but lesbian is what I came up with.

719
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:07,560
Two points. Alright.

720
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:10,560
Yeah, it's too easy. It's the easy answer.

721
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:14,560
It's the cop-out answer. Brad Dave put...

722
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:16,560
Do the lead-in.

723
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:18,560
Jamie's going to get so drunk that she...

724
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:19,560
Ends up...

725
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:20,560
Ends up...

726
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:23,560
Using the microphone. Use your imagination.

727
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:28,560
I'm sorry, did that hurt?

728
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:29,560
Okay.

729
00:44:29,560 --> 00:44:42,000
Now mine's, amazingly enough, I think I have the most PG rated answer.

730
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:48,640
Jamie's going to end up so drunk that she ends up making out with the happy bunny doll.

731
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:49,640
No mine was, I said same.

732
00:44:49,640 --> 00:44:50,640
Oh that's true, you said same.

733
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:51,640
You had the G rated answer.

734
00:44:51,640 --> 00:44:55,200
rated

735
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:56,660
all right so

736
00:44:56,660 --> 00:44:59,860
the final scores let's tally them up

737
00:44:59,860 --> 00:45:02,500
black lab has two points

738
00:45:02,500 --> 00:45:07,380
u s f e b wins tonight with three points congratulation and a bottle of propel

739
00:45:07,380 --> 00:45:08,820
you win nothing

740
00:45:08,820 --> 00:45:13,740
but you have a lot of help if you have to buy yourself okay great

741
00:45:13,740 --> 00:45:15,460
beautiful

742
00:45:15,460 --> 00:45:16,380
thank you

743
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:21,380
Our show was brought to you by Propel and Balls, which somebody needs to come and bring me some balls.

744
00:45:21,380 --> 00:45:22,380
I love balls.

745
00:45:22,380 --> 00:45:23,380
No rave, please.

746
00:45:25,380 --> 00:45:29,380
The light switch was installed, so you could turn the light on and off.

747
00:45:29,380 --> 00:45:31,380
Not that you can throw a license, Rave!

748
00:45:59,380 --> 00:46:01,380
I'm gonna do cage match next.

749
00:46:09,380 --> 00:46:11,380
I already know that I'm going to win.

750
00:46:13,380 --> 00:46:15,380
I already know that I'm going to win.

751
00:46:22,380 --> 00:46:24,380
I didn't win last time.

752
00:46:24,380 --> 00:46:26,380
I got deeper inside the passing song.

753
00:46:26,380 --> 00:46:29,380
Did I get dethroned by the cussing song last week?

754
00:46:29,380 --> 00:46:31,380
Didn't the cussing song win last week?

755
00:46:31,380 --> 00:46:33,380
I won, didn't I?

756
00:46:33,380 --> 00:46:36,380
Oh, well, god damn it, I think it's a good song.

757
00:46:36,380 --> 00:46:38,380
Yeah.

758
00:46:38,380 --> 00:46:41,380
Well, I can dethrone it myself.

759
00:46:46,380 --> 00:46:50,380
I'll take a different song.

760
00:46:52,380 --> 00:46:55,380
Why don't we just play it during this break?

761
00:46:55,380 --> 00:46:56,100
Yeah, why not?

762
00:46:56,100 --> 00:47:02,180
Okay, then we'll save, because I haven't gotten the answer on JB's mix if it was him or not, so I'll wait on that, and in the meantime, we'll play-

763
00:47:02,180 --> 00:47:03,700
It's the song that Puppy sent me.

764
00:47:03,700 --> 00:47:06,020
Okay, so what is this? Describe this for us, JB.

765
00:47:06,020 --> 00:47:10,020
Um, I don't think it needs any description. Just play it.

766
00:47:10,020 --> 00:47:11,700
No description needed, huh?

767
00:47:11,700 --> 00:47:12,180
Yeah.

768
00:47:12,180 --> 00:47:12,660
Alright.

769
00:47:12,660 --> 00:47:13,460
It's just a cool song.

770
00:47:14,100 --> 00:47:18,980
Okay, we're gonna, uh, we're gonna play this, and we'll be right back. We'll play this and another quick song, and then we'll be back.

771
00:47:18,980 --> 00:47:21,580
on orange lounge radio with the cage

772
00:47:48,980 --> 00:47:53,980
Say that I'm gonna get through this I'm gonna get through this

773
00:47:53,980 --> 00:47:56,980
I gotta take I gotta take my mind off of you

774
00:47:56,980 --> 00:47:59,980
Give me just a second then I'll be alright

775
00:47:59,980 --> 00:48:03,980
Show them what my moment could've read my heart

776
00:48:03,980 --> 00:48:06,980
Give me just a moment then you'll be okay

777
00:48:06,980 --> 00:48:11,980
Just another day and then I'll talk you tight

778
00:48:11,980 --> 00:48:15,980
When your love is pouring like rain I close my eyes and you sorta get away

779
00:48:15,980 --> 00:48:18,980
When I gave you some chance to say I love you

780
00:48:18,980 --> 00:48:20,980
I pretend that you're already mine

781
00:48:20,980 --> 00:48:22,980
So my heart ain't breaking every time

782
00:48:22,980 --> 00:48:24,980
I look into your eyes

783
00:48:24,980 --> 00:48:27,980
It's only I can feel it

784
00:48:27,980 --> 00:48:31,980
It's only I can feel it

785
00:48:31,980 --> 00:48:34,980
It's only I can feel it

786
00:48:34,980 --> 00:48:39,980
Don, Don, you gotta help me get through this

787
00:48:39,980 --> 00:48:41,980
I gotta get through this

788
00:48:41,980 --> 00:48:43,980
I gotta get through this

789
00:48:43,980 --> 00:48:47,380
I gotta make, gonna make it, gonna make it through

790
00:48:47,380 --> 00:48:51,380
Said I'm gonna get through this, I'm gonna get through this

791
00:48:51,380 --> 00:48:54,380
I gotta think, gotta think, my mind ain't got for you

792
00:48:54,380 --> 00:48:57,880
Give me just a second and I'll be alright

793
00:48:57,880 --> 00:49:01,480
Show that when my moment couldn't break my heart

794
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:05,080
Give me a touch of marble then I'll be okay

795
00:49:05,080 --> 00:49:09,580
Just another day and then I'll rock you tight

796
00:49:09,580 --> 00:49:13,580
When your love is pouring like the rain, I close my eyes and it's cold again

797
00:49:13,580 --> 00:49:16,580
When I get some chance to say I love you

798
00:49:16,580 --> 00:49:19,580
I pretend that you're ready, but I know my heart ain't breaking

799
00:49:19,580 --> 00:49:22,580
Every time my life is through, you're right

800
00:49:22,580 --> 00:49:25,580
It's only I can do it

801
00:49:25,580 --> 00:49:29,580
It's only I can do it

802
00:49:29,580 --> 00:49:32,580
It's only I can do it

803
00:49:32,580 --> 00:49:35,580
I'm gone, gotta help me get out of here

804
00:51:05,580 --> 00:51:35,560
Hi Ho, Kermit the Frog here, informing you that

805
00:51:35,560 --> 00:51:42,560
Today's broadcast of Orange Lounge Radio is brought to you by B, A, and No. 59.

806
00:52:05,560 --> 00:52:11,560
So, we're back and we're chilling. How are y'all doing? How was your week?

807
00:52:11,560 --> 00:52:15,560
Dot, dot, dot, dot. I don't know what they're doing in the other

808
00:52:15,560 --> 00:52:18,560
room. I hope my roommate's not starting to sleep. Is he? Okay, good. He's not.

809
00:52:18,560 --> 00:52:22,560
My week was a big pile of ass. Why? What happened?

810
00:52:22,560 --> 00:52:28,560
No, I don't know. It was okay. I got into some hanging out and did lots of

811
00:52:28,560 --> 00:52:33,560
busy, rocky things. I went costume hunting a bunch. I still get front damn globe.

812
00:52:33,560 --> 00:52:35,560
You know, we haven't done our fuck-yous.

813
00:52:35,560 --> 00:52:37,560
We can do the fuck-yous. We'll do the fuck-yous a little later.

814
00:52:37,560 --> 00:52:40,560
We always do the fuck-yous towards the beginning. I figure we'll save it towards the end.

815
00:52:40,560 --> 00:52:42,560
And last night was just insane.

816
00:52:43,560 --> 00:52:48,560
I think that I don't remember much of last night because I was not feeling happy.

817
00:52:48,560 --> 00:52:51,560
Last night was crazy. Yes, yes, definitely.

818
00:52:51,560 --> 00:52:53,560
And you were fabulous.

819
00:52:53,560 --> 00:52:54,560
Thank you.

820
00:52:54,560 --> 00:52:59,560
For those that don't know, we're here in Orange Orange World Radio headquarters in Sacramento, California.

821
00:52:59,560 --> 00:53:03,320
California. A lot of us that are involved here with the show are also involved

822
00:53:03,320 --> 00:53:06,600
with the local production of Rocky Orpix show, so we were doing that last night

823
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:10,580
and that was a lot of energy. So if we seem a little dead tonight, we're still

824
00:53:10,580 --> 00:53:14,560
kind of recovering from last night. However, Jamie was kind enough to go to

825
00:53:14,560 --> 00:53:19,240
Walgreens and get some double shots drinks of those coffee things. Starbucks double shots.

826
00:53:19,240 --> 00:53:23,360
Yes. So actually this episode of Orange Lodge Radio not only is brought to you

827
00:53:23,360 --> 00:53:33,360
It's brought to you by Starbuck's Double Shot Theater Drink.

828
00:53:33,360 --> 00:53:35,360
Bitter Ass Coffee.

829
00:53:35,360 --> 00:53:37,360
What was your week, Loki?

830
00:53:37,360 --> 00:53:40,360
I went and played Qs last night.

831
00:53:40,360 --> 00:53:43,360
Oh, didn't you have a story about this?

832
00:53:43,360 --> 00:53:47,360
You've got plenty of FUs besides this. Come on, tell the story.

833
00:53:47,360 --> 00:53:53,360
Yesterday was interesting. Yeah, Zero went with me, so he can, you know, okay.

834
00:53:53,360 --> 00:53:54,360
It was great.

835
00:53:54,360 --> 00:54:00,360
It was good. Vacaville, you know, it's really close, a lot closer than Concord or Pleasanton.

836
00:54:00,360 --> 00:54:01,360
Stay away.

837
00:54:01,360 --> 00:54:08,360
It was nice. Now, the bowling alley, it's actually in SARS Entertainment, like, it's like a bowling alley type place.

838
00:54:08,360 --> 00:54:13,360
They've got, like, a nice restaurant in there and, like, pizza and an arcade and stuff.

839
00:54:13,360 --> 00:54:20,360
And I'm sure I'll go into this with my FUs later on, but they had Fifth Mix and Max2 there, both in really poor condition.

840
00:54:20,360 --> 00:54:21,360
Very poor.

841
00:54:21,360 --> 00:54:30,360
Everything was broken there. Even the soda machine was pretty much all randomized. You'd pick one soda and get something else.

842
00:54:30,360 --> 00:54:35,360
The soda machine was like roulette. If you touched it, you didn't get what you wanted.

843
00:54:35,360 --> 00:54:52,360
The arena was awesome, the packs were in good condition, but it was the worst run Qsar ever. And there was annoying people there. Vacaville was full of hicks and wannabe gangsters.

844
00:54:52,360 --> 00:54:59,360
Thanks

845
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,800
it was interesting it was

846
00:55:01,800 --> 00:55:03,060
it became

847
00:55:03,060 --> 00:55:08,360
more fun later on when all the stupid people started leaving

848
00:55:08,360 --> 00:55:11,400
so that and the lack of sleep I've been doing the last few days

849
00:55:11,400 --> 00:55:18,400
because I've been going to bed at like six in the morning and getting like three hours of sleep

850
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:22,440
As far as my week goes, I've been kind of getting ready for Rocky II, I haven't done

851
00:55:22,440 --> 00:55:23,440
a lot.

852
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:24,620
I went out and played Bomani I think one time this week.

853
00:55:24,620 --> 00:55:28,120
I found that I'm suddenly, all of a sudden I'm really into DDR Extreme.

854
00:55:28,120 --> 00:55:29,980
Like all of a sudden I'm into DDR again.

855
00:55:29,980 --> 00:55:33,420
And I think a lot of that has to do with Jamie Lomi, her fifth mix.

856
00:55:33,420 --> 00:55:35,140
So I can make some linked data.

857
00:55:35,140 --> 00:55:37,100
So I can make some new linked data for Extreme.

858
00:55:37,100 --> 00:55:39,020
And now I have something to accomplish.

859
00:55:39,020 --> 00:55:41,880
Like oh my gods, I've got to get a double A on this.

860
00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:42,880
We need to re...

861
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:43,880
I'm sorry?

862
00:55:43,880 --> 00:55:47,680
We need to set our night where we do nothing but DDR.

863
00:55:47,680 --> 00:55:50,320
We kind of used to do those on Friday night, but that physical, well we used to, way in

864
00:55:50,320 --> 00:55:52,760
the day we did it on Wednesday night, but then I started going to karaoke except I'm

865
00:55:52,760 --> 00:55:55,240
not even going anymore, so maybe we could just do Wednesdays again.

866
00:55:55,240 --> 00:55:56,240
So maybe that'll work.

867
00:55:56,240 --> 00:55:57,240
I need to get a copy of Fifth.

868
00:55:57,240 --> 00:55:58,240
I need to start making edits so bad.

869
00:55:58,240 --> 00:56:02,720
I do fourth edits all the time and I'm getting kind of old now.

870
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:04,480
We can probably get you a copy of Fifth one way or another.

871
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:07,880
If Jamie lets you, if Jamie lets me keep her copy a little, couple more days, I'll

872
00:56:07,880 --> 00:56:08,880
make you a copy.

873
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:10,880
I brought you like ten CDs to burn stuff on.

874
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:11,880
Cool!

875
00:56:11,880 --> 00:56:12,880
So.

876
00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:14,120
Alright, whatever works.

877
00:56:14,120 --> 00:56:16,600
We don't endorse pirating on this show, no we don't.

878
00:56:16,600 --> 00:56:17,600
No.

879
00:56:17,600 --> 00:56:22,280
I'll be honest. I'll be honest. We never really talked about this in Orange Laundry.

880
00:56:22,280 --> 00:56:23,920
Let me talk about my views on pirating games.

881
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:27,560
As far as my DDR is concerned and the money stuff.

882
00:56:27,560 --> 00:56:30,760
Never the US ones, always the Japanese ones.

883
00:56:30,760 --> 00:56:36,040
And I say it's okay because I think the price you pay to import this stuff is

884
00:56:36,040 --> 00:56:38,280
just outrageous to import this stuff from Japan. And honestly,

885
00:56:38,280 --> 00:56:41,400
if they wanted me to buy it, they'd release it in this country. So I figure if they're not

886
00:56:41,400 --> 00:56:43,560
going to release it in this country, if they're not going to take that effort to

887
00:56:43,560 --> 00:56:47,160
satisfy, you know, our demand by releasing it here, then I'm going to pirate it.

888
00:56:47,160 --> 00:56:55,160
But I have bought every US Bamani release, every one. Even the very crappy first USA mix, I bought it just because I wanted to support Bamani.

889
00:56:55,160 --> 00:56:59,160
And reserved them at Gamestop. The one at Ardent Square Mall.

890
00:56:59,160 --> 00:57:08,160
Even still, I think it's kind of crap that you have to buy their shit that they release in order for them to hopefully bring out better stuff later on. I think that's really stupid.

891
00:57:08,160 --> 00:57:12,160
They did, but DDR Max was pretty good. You have to admit.

892
00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:16,160
It was pretty good, but USA, the first one, sucked ass.

893
00:57:16,160 --> 00:57:20,480
and I played it maybe twice. But I felt okay. This is kind of the way I felt. I said, okay,

894
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:23,920
I've played all those Japanese ones for free, so I've played all these songs for free.

895
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:26,560
But did you just see the first one they released in Japan? It was kind of after.

896
00:57:26,560 --> 00:57:29,280
Yeah, the one that we... But it had strictly business.

897
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:33,680
In comparison, though, to everything since, you know, you have to start somewhere.

898
00:57:33,680 --> 00:57:39,600
I mean, this is an old debate that goes, you know, back about a year now. Was that when

899
00:57:39,600 --> 00:57:44,080
USA was released, about a year ago? More than that. That was a long time ago.

900
00:57:44,080 --> 00:57:48,080
The Disney Mix, the USA one, I played that one time.

901
00:57:48,080 --> 00:57:50,080
Yeah, I had the Disney one.

902
00:57:50,080 --> 00:57:54,080
I just don't even really play those songs, but I bought it just because I had played Disney's Rave a lot.

903
00:57:54,080 --> 00:57:55,080
I think it's like...

904
00:57:55,080 --> 00:57:56,080
So it was kind of my conscious...

905
00:57:56,080 --> 00:57:59,080
Or something at my house. Just set drinks on it.

906
00:57:59,080 --> 00:58:00,080
That's all it took.

907
00:58:00,080 --> 00:58:04,080
I think, I think, uh, Magus, Somnimagus has my copy and doesn't realize it.

908
00:58:04,080 --> 00:58:08,080
I have the Japanese version sitting right in front of the US one in my collection at home.

909
00:58:08,080 --> 00:58:12,800
So, I think I played it one time so I could get the maniac steps, and I wanted to see

910
00:58:12,800 --> 00:58:16,360
how hard the 10-footers were, and then I was unimpressed, so...

911
00:58:16,360 --> 00:58:18,000
Dance magic, nuff said.

912
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,800
Yeah, it's all about dance magic.

913
00:58:20,800 --> 00:58:24,400
So um, yeah, I say it's okay to pirate the Japanese ones.

914
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:25,400
Rob?

915
00:58:25,400 --> 00:58:26,400
Yeah?

916
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:27,400
Is this your yo-yo?

917
00:58:27,400 --> 00:58:28,400
No, it's Brian's.

918
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:29,400
Brian's yo-yo sucks.

919
00:58:29,400 --> 00:58:30,400
I'm sorry.

920
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:31,400
I'm gonna get you a yo-yo.

921
00:58:31,400 --> 00:58:32,400
You can get Brian a yo-yo.

922
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:33,400
I'll buy Brian a yo-yo.

923
00:58:33,400 --> 00:58:34,400
Alright.

924
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:35,400
So...

925
00:58:35,400 --> 00:58:37,400
I want a yo-yo ball right now.

926
00:58:37,400 --> 00:58:40,400
You want to talk Sim stuff?

927
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:41,400
Sim.

928
00:58:41,400 --> 00:58:43,400
Okay, you want to talk about this?

929
00:58:43,400 --> 00:58:44,400
Alright.

930
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:45,400
This was just announced this week.

931
00:58:45,400 --> 00:58:48,400
Konami in Japan is making a brand new game.

932
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:51,400
It's called Aerobics Revolution.

933
00:58:51,400 --> 00:58:54,400
Tell me it doesn't remind you of an old school 8-bit game.

934
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:55,400
It's dance aerobics.

935
00:58:55,400 --> 00:58:56,400
Yes it is.

936
00:58:56,400 --> 00:58:57,400
It's dance aerobics.

937
00:58:57,400 --> 00:58:58,400
I swear to God it looks just like it.

938
00:58:58,400 --> 00:59:02,400
But basically it's going to be an aerobics game that uses your DDR mat.

939
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:05,040
You know you love it, and it looks like it has a little DDR SIM mode

940
00:59:05,040 --> 00:59:10,400
They're kind of taking diet mode and making it its own game. I guess I don't know we'd only know much about this

941
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:13,660
It looks like it's a home one yeah

942
00:59:13,660 --> 00:59:16,700
It's gonna be a home release for PlayStation 2 and it's gonna be out March 13th

943
00:59:17,400 --> 00:59:24,240
And it looks like it probably it kind of looks like it's gonna have like follow the Shadow Dancers kind of like a power mode

944
00:59:24,240 --> 00:59:26,240
So it's probably got like aerobics routines in it

945
00:59:27,360 --> 00:59:29,360
And I'll probably keep track of how well you're doing

946
00:59:29,360 --> 00:59:37,240
doing? By the feet. And you know what? Dance Aerobics was very similar, I thought. So we'll

947
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:43,000
see. We'll compare when this Aerobics revolution comes out. We'll see how similar it was to

948
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:46,260
Dance Aerobics. I did play Dance Aerobics one time back in the day. I borrowed a power

949
00:59:46,260 --> 00:59:48,840
pad from my best friend in elementary school. I have a power pad and I have Dance Aerobics.

950
00:59:48,840 --> 00:59:53,720
Do you? And track and field. You know what? On one week on Orange Lounge, we need to have

951
00:59:53,720 --> 00:59:58,640
a power pad night. We need to have the power pad Olympics on Orange Lounge Radio. I kicked

952
00:59:58,640 --> 01:00:05,640
Okay, we're gonna do that one night. We'll get a crowd here and we'll move the show out into the other room. We'll have the Power Pad Olympics. How's that sound?

953
01:00:05,640 --> 01:00:06,640
Okay.

954
01:00:06,640 --> 01:00:07,640
Alright, cool.

955
01:00:07,640 --> 01:00:11,640
It looks like the dance aerobics, it looks like it uses all the buttons too.

956
01:00:11,640 --> 01:00:12,640
All six?

957
01:00:12,640 --> 01:00:14,640
All six of them, however many there are.

958
01:00:14,640 --> 01:00:18,640
It looks like there's almost one in the middle. You see how this one has it lit up? But I don't think there's a button on the...

959
01:00:18,640 --> 01:00:19,640
I don't think they would do that.

960
01:00:19,640 --> 01:00:22,640
Yeah, I don't know. Maybe it's just showing where your feet are supposed to be.

961
01:00:22,640 --> 01:00:23,640
Maybe you use it one foot forward to see that.

962
01:00:23,640 --> 01:00:24,640
A lot of this is speculation.

963
01:00:24,640 --> 01:00:25,640
We'll link the chat room.

964
01:00:25,640 --> 01:00:29,640
We'll link the chat room to this, just in case you guys haven't heard about this yet

965
01:00:29,640 --> 01:00:32,640
and you want to look up the site like we're looking at right now. There it is.

966
01:00:32,640 --> 01:00:35,640
And if you're not in our chat room, why the hell not?

967
01:00:35,640 --> 01:00:39,640
Get over to our website, orangelounge.skie.cx and click on chat room.

968
01:00:39,640 --> 01:00:44,640
This game actually does look pretty interesting.

969
01:00:44,640 --> 01:00:50,640
I'm definitely going to get it when it's out, so you might get a full review from me.

970
01:00:50,640 --> 01:00:51,640
Alright, sounds good.

971
01:00:51,640 --> 01:00:54,840
whatever the fuck happened to marshall beat

972
01:00:54,840 --> 01:00:58,640
wasn't ok i've seen the marshall beat machine once in arcadia today do you

973
01:00:58,640 --> 01:00:59,920
have a home version

974
01:00:59,920 --> 01:01:06,920
do they have a home version of you i played it just this week

975
01:01:06,920 --> 01:01:08,280
it's like it's horrible

976
01:01:08,280 --> 01:01:11,880
it has sensors on your hands and legs there's a link to it if you go someone

977
01:01:11,880 --> 01:01:13,780
selling a bunch of them on ebay

978
01:01:13,780 --> 01:01:15,200
and they'll send you the

979
01:01:15,200 --> 01:01:17,720
gun konami site that we actually talked about it

980
01:01:17,720 --> 01:01:19,560
looks retarded

981
01:01:19,560 --> 01:01:23,720
It's like you're fighting in dance beat.

982
01:01:23,720 --> 01:01:25,800
It's interesting.

983
01:01:25,800 --> 01:01:27,920
When Loki and I were at AI

984
01:01:27,920 --> 01:01:31,600
a couple weeks ago when we were off one week from the show, we were at Arcade Infinity,

985
01:01:31,600 --> 01:01:36,080
we saw a Marshall Beat machine and not a damn person playing it the whole time.

986
01:01:36,080 --> 01:01:39,720
I didn't want to... I thought I'd look like an idiot playing it.

987
01:01:39,720 --> 01:01:42,560
That didn't stop you from playing PDR.

988
01:01:42,560 --> 01:01:44,560
It wasn't...

989
01:01:44,560 --> 01:01:48,760
It's an okay concept, but the music they had going with it was like it didn't match.

990
01:01:48,760 --> 01:01:55,760
you know you have petite love? You're kicking ass to petite love? What the fuck is that?

991
01:01:57,840 --> 01:01:58,980
there's actually two

992
01:01:58,980 --> 01:02:00,420
versions of it for the home now

993
01:02:00,420 --> 01:02:06,200
they have the first one and I guess they just released the second one recently

994
01:02:06,200 --> 01:02:08,880
I think they made the sequel before they made the first one

995
01:02:08,880 --> 01:02:11,600
it was pretty bad

996
01:02:11,600 --> 01:02:14,640
that just sounds like utter ass

997
01:02:14,640 --> 01:02:18,100
Marshall Beat is missable basically is what we're all kind of coming to

998
01:02:18,100 --> 01:02:21,840
consensus. Was there any songs that weren't in DDR on Marshall Beat? Punch Mania.

999
01:02:21,840 --> 01:02:25,520
Crap. But Gun Mania is cool.

1000
01:02:25,520 --> 01:02:30,120
Gun Mania is cool. Gun Mania is cool. It's the pellet shooting game.

1001
01:02:30,120 --> 01:02:34,760
Gun Mania. They had it in AI but it's always broken.

1002
01:02:34,760 --> 01:02:38,760
I made a joke that I was going to move in there and build a bed in there because it's large enough.

1003
01:02:38,760 --> 01:02:42,240
It's huge.

1004
01:02:42,240 --> 01:02:44,080
uh...

1005
01:02:44,080 --> 01:02:48,360
moving right along

1006
01:02:48,360 --> 01:02:53,440
a look into that after the show or being told chairman

1007
01:02:53,440 --> 01:02:58,920
what else going to do or is anything going on similar looking

1008
01:02:58,920 --> 01:03:00,320
you're talking about some stuff with me

1009
01:03:00,320 --> 01:03:02,960
uh... okay

1010
01:03:02,960 --> 01:03:06,400
uh... they've got another cell two thousand three so going on

1011
01:03:06,400 --> 01:03:07,320
except other

1012
01:03:07,320 --> 01:03:11,020
you get the icon testing

1013
01:03:11,020 --> 01:03:16,460
My site is coming up some day, so that'll be it.

1014
01:03:16,460 --> 01:03:21,500
But my sale's releasing more of the DDR Extreme SIM files.

1015
01:03:21,500 --> 01:03:23,700
You can find them with the backgrounds and all that

1016
01:03:23,700 --> 01:03:24,380
wonderful stuff.

1017
01:03:24,380 --> 01:03:26,540
Are they still having Jesus complex about it?

1018
01:03:26,540 --> 01:03:26,940
I don't know.

1019
01:03:26,940 --> 01:03:28,500
I don't care anymore.

1020
01:03:28,500 --> 01:03:31,700
They're also doing a full re-release on all the old

1021
01:03:31,700 --> 01:03:32,860
official SIM files.

1022
01:03:32,860 --> 01:03:38,020
And they're doing them with the CD banner

1023
01:03:38,020 --> 01:03:46,720
things on there also and then see actually all the DDR extreme ones have

1024
01:03:46,720 --> 01:03:50,060
been released with banners just not Bob Imani style they're on another set but I

1025
01:03:50,060 --> 01:03:53,740
can't remember which one so no help there just look on DDR freak you'll find

1026
01:03:53,740 --> 01:04:00,740
or not here DDR maniacs you'll find a link for it I'm sure the other than

1027
01:04:00,740 --> 01:04:04,740
And that's not too much going on at all.

1028
01:04:04,740 --> 01:04:08,740
It's been incredibly slow.

1029
01:04:08,740 --> 01:04:21,740
No real sim updates. I mean, they had a CSV snapshot update of StepMania that they're working on that was released back on the 16th of January, I think.

1030
01:04:21,740 --> 01:04:28,740
no, 26th of January. And then there's, you know, DWI 2.4 was released a couple weeks

1031
01:04:28,740 --> 01:04:35,180
ago also. So those are brand new. What gives a crap about everything else? I don't know.

1032
01:04:35,180 --> 01:04:43,300
There's nothing going on. Just forget it. Slow. Just watch DDR Maniacs and BimaniSims.com

1033
01:04:43,300 --> 01:04:48,540
for, like, homemade stuff because you'll find the most released stuff there. Bimani style,

1034
01:04:48,540 --> 01:04:53,120
you know you'll find the official stuff there that's pretty much it you know

1035
01:04:53,120 --> 01:04:57,620
check the Japanese sites because there's always all these Japanese sites you guys

1036
01:04:57,620 --> 01:05:04,580
are missing and they have really cool shit on there cool and of course the

1037
01:05:04,580 --> 01:05:09,660
most notable news in the DWI sim file world orange lounge radio is doing a

watching you. Shut up! Shut up! I saw Robin Drag like a big ol' queen. No, it was great.

01:05:44,220 --> 01:05:51,980
You were great. I'm beautiful, dammit. You definitely lit the stage. I'm gonna set this

1044
01:05:51,980 --> 01:06:01,300
stage on fire! Yep, it was flamin' all night. Okay, so, let's start off, uh, just one second,

1045
01:06:01,300 --> 01:06:02,620
We need our theme song.

1046
01:06:02,620 --> 01:06:04,460
Yes, here's the theme song.

1047
01:06:04,460 --> 01:06:06,020
Which, if you were paying attention,

1048
01:06:06,020 --> 01:06:07,660
you know it's Jamie's favorite tax song.

1049
01:06:07,660 --> 01:06:08,260
I'm Owlette.

1050
01:06:08,260 --> 01:06:10,180

And the winner gets put into Orange Lounge Rotation for the whole week.

1061
01:06:39,540 --> 01:06:42,780
And this song has been in for two weeks now, looking for its third week.

1062
01:06:42,780 --> 01:06:44,660
This is the second time this has happened.

1063
01:06:44,660 --> 01:06:45,320
All right.

1064
01:06:45,320 --> 01:06:46,940
This is the first song you can vote for.

1065
01:06:46,940 --> 01:06:49,980
The winner only gets a clip played of it, but we'll play a nice clip.

1066
01:06:49,980 --> 01:06:50,500
Here we go.

1067
01:06:50,500 --> 01:06:51,580
This is last week's winner.

1068
01:06:51,580 --> 01:06:54,940
It's Vincent DeMoor with Eternity, the first song in tonight's Page Match.

1069
01:06:54,940 --> 01:06:56,420
And now the winner.

1070
01:06:56,420 --> 01:06:59,420
It's all an eternity

1071
01:07:05,420 --> 01:07:07,420
Won't you join me?

1072
01:07:07,420 --> 01:07:09,420
If it's right for you and me

1073
01:07:09,420 --> 01:07:12,420
It's all in this place to be

1074
01:07:16,420 --> 01:07:18,420
It's gonna be forever

1075
01:07:18,420 --> 01:07:19,420
Not just for one day

1076
01:07:19,420 --> 01:07:21,420
The feeling's gonna take you

1077
01:07:21,420 --> 01:07:23,420
It takes you all the way

1078
01:07:26,420 --> 01:07:28,420
It's gonna be forever

1079
01:07:33,420 --> 01:07:35,420
Forever

1080
01:07:40,420 --> 01:07:41,420
Forever

1081
01:07:41,420 --> 01:07:58,420
Alright, that's song number one you can vote for, that's Vincent D'Amore with Eternity.

1082
01:07:58,420 --> 01:08:03,700
Now I notice Loki's got something, he's trying very hard this week, he might do it to throw

1083
01:08:03,700 --> 01:08:04,700
in Eternity.

1084
01:08:04,700 --> 01:08:06,540
If any song's gonna do it, it's gonna be this one.

1085
01:08:06,540 --> 01:08:10,340
I don't even know why I'm gonna bother tonight, but Loki, read it out.

1086
01:08:10,340 --> 01:08:13,340
Alright, this one's a brand new track.

1087
01:08:13,340 --> 01:08:16,340
Loki vs ZZ featuring Sun Decade.

1088
01:08:16,340 --> 01:08:21,340
This is the debut of the finished version of The Legend of Trance.

1089
01:08:21,340 --> 01:08:28,340
Here it is, the Legend of Trance Loki stage match pick tonight.

1090
01:08:51,340 --> 01:08:52,340
H

1091
01:08:52,340 --> 01:08:53,340
H

1092
01:08:53,340 --> 01:08:54,340
H

1093
01:08:54,340 --> 01:08:55,340
H

1094
01:08:55,340 --> 01:08:56,340
H

1095
01:08:56,340 --> 01:08:57,340
H

1096
01:10:57,340 --> 01:11:18,980
Alright, that was Loki himself versus ZZ featuring Sun Decade with the Legend of Trance.

1097
01:11:18,980 --> 01:11:25,980
what you guys think of it

1098
01:11:29,980 --> 01:11:36,980
for the meeting

1099
01:11:36,980 --> 01:12:05,980
Are we on? Yeah, we're on. Anyway. Yeah, you get 9. Alrighty, 0. Well, I actually had a chance to listen to it last night on the way the views are, and I definitely give it a 9. It was a great song. It was a pretty fun song. Loki, what'd you think? Dare I have? He gives himself a 69.

1100
01:12:05,980 --> 01:12:12,980
I like it. You know, it can always be better, but yeah, 9.

1101
01:12:12,980 --> 01:12:13,980
Alright.

1102
01:12:13,980 --> 01:12:15,980
I'm buying a 10, because I can!

1103
01:12:15,980 --> 01:12:16,980
Alright.

1104
01:12:16,980 --> 01:12:21,980
He doesn't have a big ego now.

1105
01:12:21,980 --> 01:12:24,980
It was very well done, I give it a 9.

1106
01:12:24,980 --> 01:12:26,980
Ooh, 9's across the board so far.

1107
01:12:26,980 --> 01:12:27,980
Brad?

1108
01:12:27,980 --> 01:12:32,980
I think the earlier version of this gets a 9. This, he cleaned it up, this gets a 10.

1109
01:12:32,980 --> 01:12:34,980
Oh, a 10 from Brad!

1110
01:12:34,980 --> 01:12:39,940
wait wait wait for the legend of trance nevermind it was crap i get a zero

1111
01:12:39,940 --> 01:12:41,340
all right um

1112
01:12:41,340 --> 01:12:42,740
loki what can

1113
01:12:42,740 --> 01:12:47,100
what can i say loki you're my i'm your biggest fanboy but i'm not going to

1114
01:12:47,100 --> 01:12:50,860
inflate your ego by giving you a ten so you get a nine point nine

1115
01:12:50,860 --> 01:12:54,820
uh... damn so he gets a nine point nine

1116
01:12:54,820 --> 01:12:56,540
all right

1117
01:12:56,540 --> 01:13:00,220
so there's your first two songs eternity from vincent amore and loki with the

1118
01:13:00,220 --> 01:13:01,860
legend of trance

1119
01:13:01,860 --> 01:13:05,720
I've decided since both of those two are very kick-ass songs there's no way in

1120
01:13:05,720 --> 01:13:10,960
fucking hell I was gonna win with my original pick, so I'm going for broke!

1121
01:13:10,960 --> 01:13:12,920
Forget this trance stuff!

1122
01:13:12,920 --> 01:13:16,000
I'm just gonna play something that's fucking cool.

1123
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:19,520
So my pick for tonight's cage match comes from a little movie you may or may not have

1124
01:13:19,520 --> 01:13:20,440
heard of.

1125
01:13:20,440 --> 01:13:24,000
It's a musical, because everybody loves musicals.

1126
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:25,280
It's from a little

1127
01:13:25,280 --> 01:13:27,480
little story about a boy

1128
01:13:27,480 --> 01:13:30,920
who's a girl.

1129
01:13:30,920 --> 01:13:35,920
and it's called Hedwig and the Angry Inch, so my pick for tonight's cage match

1130
01:13:35,920 --> 01:13:39,920
is Angry Inch from the movie Hedwig and the Angry Inch, and you know what, this song

1131
01:13:39,920 --> 01:13:44,920
really would make a kick-ass guitar freaks song, so, fuck you! Alright, enjoy!

1132
01:13:44,920 --> 01:13:46,920
This is, uh, Hedwig and the Angry Inch with Angry Inch.

1133
01:13:46,920 --> 01:14:12,680
My sex change operation got fucked, my guardian angel fell asleep on the watch, now all I

1134
01:14:12,680 --> 01:14:14,680
All I got is a barbed-up front

1135
01:14:14,680 --> 01:14:16,680
I got an angry itch

1136
01:14:16,680 --> 01:14:20,680
Six inches forward, five inches back

1137
01:14:20,680 --> 01:14:22,680
I got a, I got an angry itch

1138
01:14:22,680 --> 01:14:26,680
Six inches forward, five inches back

1139
01:14:26,680 --> 01:14:28,680
I got a, I got an angry itch

1140
01:14:28,680 --> 01:14:33,680
I'm from the land where you still hear the cries

1141
01:14:33,680 --> 01:14:36,680
I had to get out not to sever all ties

1142
01:14:36,680 --> 01:14:39,680
I changed my name and assumed the disguise

1143
01:15:09,680 --> 01:15:15,680
My mama made my tits out of clay My boyfriend told me that he'd take me away

1144
01:15:15,680 --> 01:15:21,680
And he dragged me to the doctor one day I got an idea

1145
01:15:21,680 --> 01:15:27,680
I said, this is fun, fine, this is bad I gotta go, I gotta find it

1146
01:15:27,680 --> 01:15:33,680
I said, this is fun, fine, this is bad I gotta, I gotta find it

1147
01:15:33,680 --> 01:15:35,680
Long story short

1148
01:15:35,680 --> 01:15:42,680
Long story short, when I woke up from the operation, I was bleeding down there.

1149
01:15:42,680 --> 01:15:46,680
I was bleeding from the gash between my legs.

1150
01:15:46,680 --> 01:15:52,680
It was my first day as a woman, already that time of the month.

1151
01:15:52,680 --> 01:15:56,680
Two days later the hole closed up, you know.

1152
01:15:56,680 --> 01:16:02,680
The wound healed and I was left with a one inch mound of flesh.

1153
01:16:02,680 --> 01:16:06,080
Oh, where my penis used to be, where my vagina never was

1154
01:16:06,080 --> 01:16:09,080
It was a one-inch mound of flesh

1155
01:16:09,080 --> 01:16:15,480
With the scar running down it like a sideways grimace on an eyelash face

1156
01:16:15,480 --> 01:16:19,080
It was just a little buzz, they were letting it in

1157
01:16:19,080 --> 01:16:22,680
Six inches falling, five inches back

1158
01:16:22,680 --> 01:16:25,880
The pain is coming and I'm tired of the track

1159
01:16:25,880 --> 01:16:28,280
I try to get over, don't take it no step

1160
01:16:28,280 --> 01:16:56,400
We got a lot of dots from the chatroom.

1161
01:16:56,400 --> 01:16:57,400
They are.

1162
01:16:57,400 --> 01:17:00,400
Okay, how do we get the Angry Inch with Angry Inch?

1163
01:17:00,400 --> 01:17:01,400
Jamie.

1164
01:17:01,400 --> 01:17:02,400
Jamie gives it a ten.

1165
01:17:02,400 --> 01:17:03,400
A big ten.

1166
01:17:03,400 --> 01:17:04,400
Loki.

1167
01:17:04,400 --> 01:17:05,400
It's zero.

1168
01:17:05,400 --> 01:17:09,400
She just wants to give it a ten for her song once again.

1169
01:17:09,400 --> 01:17:11,400
I don't know about that.

1170
01:17:11,400 --> 01:17:14,400
I guess I'll give it like seven or something.

1171
01:17:14,400 --> 01:17:17,400
It was funny as hell, but I don't know.

1172
01:17:17,400 --> 01:17:21,400
I will see the movie one day and then I'll give it something higher maybe.

1173
01:17:21,400 --> 01:17:22,400
Loki.

1174
01:17:22,400 --> 01:17:26,400
I'd give it eight because it had colorful lyrics.

1175
01:17:26,400 --> 01:17:33,400
uh...

1176
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:37,200
and i did it and if that was a good time for you to play it every

1177
01:17:37,200 --> 01:17:40,840
freaking game you know i would like to go to the house i would actually go to

1178
01:17:40,840 --> 01:17:42,720
roosevelt off my hands and i thought

1179
01:17:42,720 --> 01:17:46,760
the wind here

1180
01:17:46,760 --> 01:17:47,840
here

1181
01:17:47,840 --> 01:17:51,760
your penis and vagina in the middle of roosevelt off

1182
01:17:51,760 --> 01:17:52,640
world

1183
01:17:52,640 --> 01:17:57,140
I mean, when we're all there, I usually end up yelling penis and vagina anyway in conversation.

1184
01:17:57,140 --> 01:17:58,140
Penis!

1185
01:17:58,140 --> 01:17:59,140
Vagina!

1186
01:17:59,140 --> 01:18:00,140
Penis!

1187
01:18:00,140 --> 01:18:01,140
Vagina!

1188
01:18:01,140 --> 01:18:02,140
Penis!

1189
01:18:02,140 --> 01:18:03,140
Alright.

1190
01:18:03,140 --> 01:18:04,140
Let's...

1191
01:18:04,140 --> 01:18:09,240
You may start sending in your votes now to myself in the chat room, Skye, chat room slut.

1192
01:18:09,240 --> 01:18:11,740
Or you can send those over email to orangeboxradio.yahoo.com.

1193
01:18:11,740 --> 01:18:14,240
Let's review, shall we, really quickly.

1194
01:18:14,240 --> 01:18:16,240
Choice number one, Eternity by Vincent de Mor.

1195
01:18:16,240 --> 01:18:42,120
Choice number two, Loki with the Legend of Trance.

1196
01:18:42,120 --> 01:18:45,480
Choice number three, Hedwig and the Angry Inch with Angry Inch.

1197
01:18:45,480 --> 01:19:05,480
All right, there they are. Vote now. We'll tally those votes up during the next break.

1198
01:19:05,480 --> 01:19:07,480
Yeah, this matches.

1199
01:19:07,480 --> 01:19:13,480
Okay, wow, that was a fun cage match. We had an old favorite trance song, a new favorite

1200
01:19:13,480 --> 01:19:27,680
I need to do my request of the week for any aspiring person who wants to make a mix of

1201
01:19:27,680 --> 01:19:29,120
anything.

1202
01:19:29,120 --> 01:19:31,760
I want the safari trance mix.

1203
01:19:31,760 --> 01:19:33,040
You want a trance mix of the safari?

1204
01:19:33,040 --> 01:19:34,760
Yes, my request is still out there.

1205
01:19:34,760 --> 01:19:37,040
I played the safari today and I failed very badly.

1206
01:19:37,040 --> 01:19:39,040
We need to play the safari during the break.

1207
01:19:39,040 --> 01:19:41,520
Okay, we'll play the safari during the break.

1208
01:19:41,520 --> 01:19:46,480
Remember for whoever makes this for me. I'm going to reward you in some form or fashion if it's cool, okay?

1209
01:19:48,040 --> 01:19:49,920
Darkest who you was reminding me of something

1210
01:19:49,920 --> 01:19:53,160
I need to play for y'all just to get what your thoughts are on this for y'all

1211
01:19:53,160 --> 01:19:59,280
I thought I was the southern chick here. I'm just a southern bale in a boy's body

1212
01:20:00,120 --> 01:20:02,600
Just kidding. I can get one of those trail made dresses

1213
01:20:02,600 --> 01:20:07,600
This is um I'm being told that this is a clip from a new song in pop and music 9

1214
01:20:07,600 --> 01:20:14,600
Tell me if this sounds a little familiar to you guys.

1215
01:20:37,600 --> 01:20:44,600
Alright, that's the clip we got.

1216
01:21:07,600 --> 01:21:17,600
I don't know the story behind that, where that came from. I guess I'm being told it's Popin' Music 9. I don't know enough about Popin' Music to know if that's true or not.

1217
01:21:17,600 --> 01:21:21,600
Check the Japanese site for a music list.

1218
01:21:21,600 --> 01:21:26,600
Well, from what I remember, the original URL that was posted was from Bomani's sale.

1219
01:21:26,600 --> 01:21:28,600
Ah, alright.

1220
01:21:28,600 --> 01:21:34,600
So, yeah. Guitar Freaks version. I don't know about Popin' Music. Sounds more Guitar Freaks to me, but whatever.

1221
01:21:34,600 --> 01:21:37,400
Well, we have Dyke and Ty from, uh...

1222
01:21:37,400 --> 01:21:38,400
True.

1223
01:21:38,400 --> 01:21:39,400
I mean, this...

1224
01:21:39,400 --> 01:21:40,400
Yeah.

1225
01:21:40,400 --> 01:21:46,360
The freakin' Cutie Honey theme song in pop music.

1226
01:21:46,360 --> 01:21:48,560
It's labeled as not as absolute as...

1227
01:21:48,560 --> 01:21:50,200
It's labeled as Abotage.

1228
01:21:50,200 --> 01:21:51,200
Okay.

1229
01:21:51,200 --> 01:21:52,200
Whatever.

1230
01:21:52,200 --> 01:21:58,480
That's what they had on there, they were talking about, like, if they were to make lyrics for

1231
01:21:58,480 --> 01:22:03,840
it, like, we drink Rilin for a hot, hot limit, it was Icy Frozen Lightning Bolt.

1232
01:22:03,840 --> 01:22:09,840
I have very few votes registered in right now for the cage match. I hope you all are voting.

1233
01:22:09,840 --> 01:22:12,840
Send those in or we'll kill you.

1234
01:22:12,840 --> 01:22:14,840
Vote or you get kicked.

1235
01:22:14,840 --> 01:22:17,840
Vote or you get kicked from the chat room. Just kidding.

1236
01:22:17,840 --> 01:22:19,840
We slap you with the trout.

1237
01:22:19,840 --> 01:22:22,840
Alright, no, but seriously, you guys only have a few more minutes to send votes.

1238
01:22:22,840 --> 01:22:24,840
Okay, I promise we will play this last break. We didn't get around to it.

1239
01:22:24,840 --> 01:22:27,840
But this is a JB mix. We've heard something from Loki.

1240
01:22:27,840 --> 01:22:32,840
One of our other regulars, JB, made a remix of, guess what, a Jenny Rom song.

1241
01:22:32,840 --> 01:22:41,840
But you know what, JB did some good shit with that Sega thing, the Sega CD BIOS music, so I'm actually looking forward to hearing this. I think this will be very cool.

1242
01:22:41,840 --> 01:22:47,840
This is a remix of Jenny Rom with Do You Wanna Flirt? It's called the Modern Dub Remix, and I'm looking forward to hearing it.

1243
01:22:47,840 --> 01:22:50,840
And you should too, this remix by JB in our chatroom.

1244
01:22:50,840 --> 01:22:52,840
Here we go, Orange Launch Radio.

1245
01:24:50,840 --> 01:24:54,840
Uh, uh, uh Hvuh, hvuh, hvuh, hvuh

1246
01:24:54,840 --> 01:24:58,840
Hvuh, hvuh, hvuh Hvuh, hvuh, hvuh

1247
01:24:58,840 --> 01:25:02,840
Hvuh, hvuh, hvuh Hvuh, hvuh, hvuh

1248
01:25:02,840 --> 01:25:06,840
Hvuh, hvuh, hvuh Hvuh, hvuh, hvuh

1249
01:25:06,840 --> 01:25:10,840
Hvuh, hvuh, hvuh Hvuh, hvuh, hvuh

1250
01:25:10,840 --> 01:25:14,840
Hvuh, hvuh, hvuh

1251
01:25:14,840 --> 01:25:18,840
Hvuh, hvuh, hvuh

1252
01:26:18,840 --> 01:26:48,720
Alright, my

1253
01:26:48,720 --> 01:26:54,980
My apologies to JB because that's the modem dub mix, not the modern dub mix.

1254
01:26:54,980 --> 01:26:55,980
My bad.

1255
01:26:55,980 --> 01:26:56,980
Jesus.

1256
01:26:56,980 --> 01:26:57,980
So that's the modem dub mix.

1257
01:26:57,980 --> 01:26:58,980
Nice job, nice job.

1258
01:26:58,980 --> 01:26:59,980
All right, back to break.

1259
01:29:29,980 --> 01:29:31,980
I feel the light

1260
01:29:51,980 --> 01:29:54,980
I feel the light of the night

1261
01:29:54,980 --> 01:29:58,980
I feel the light of the time

1262
01:30:28,980 --> 01:30:58,660
Let's listen in on an Orange Lounge radio staff meeting.

1263
01:30:58,660 --> 01:31:05,660
Bevani Radio. That's us. Orange Lounge Radio.

1264
01:31:07,180 --> 01:31:12,060
Sounds like Rejected.

1265
01:31:12,060 --> 01:31:14,960
Best movie ever.

1266
01:31:14,960 --> 01:31:18,740
Peewee's Big Adventure, when he gets kidnapped by the bikers.

1267
01:31:18,740 --> 01:31:22,420
Did you know that that's Elvira? The female one that grabs him by the

1268
01:31:22,420 --> 01:31:23,260
neck and goes,

1269
01:31:23,260 --> 01:31:28,160
I see. I don't remember what she said. That's Elvira, the chick.

1270
01:31:28,160 --> 01:31:29,560
Well, next time, pay attention!

1271
01:31:29,560 --> 01:31:34,200
If you saw Spider-Man, the punk girl that they interview, is Lucy Lawless.

1272
01:31:34,200 --> 01:31:36,560
Yep, Lucy Lawless is in there.

1273
01:31:36,560 --> 01:31:38,040
Right on.

1274
01:31:38,040 --> 01:31:40,040
Okay, yay!

1275
01:31:40,040 --> 01:31:44,200
Wow, that's sad when I do a better Xena impression than Jamie. Ow, I got kicked!

1276
01:31:44,200 --> 01:31:46,240
Okay.

1277
01:31:46,240 --> 01:31:48,520
By the way, I have to...

1278
01:31:48,520 --> 01:31:50,240
Yes?

1279
01:31:50,240 --> 01:31:54,860
What are you doing? Who's the victim? Are you going to randomly kick somebody from the chat room? Who's the victim?

1280
01:31:54,860 --> 01:31:59,580
Oh, or you slap somebody with a trout? Yes.

1281
01:31:59,580 --> 01:32:00,420
Oh, I see.

1282
01:32:00,420 --> 01:32:05,460
Well, you made me slap somebody. Ha ha!

1283
01:32:05,460 --> 01:32:08,320
Now the whole chat room is joining in great.

1284
01:32:08,320 --> 01:32:10,160
I start trends.

1285
01:32:10,160 --> 01:32:12,460
You're such a trendsetter.

1286
01:32:12,460 --> 01:32:16,120
Let's see, oh yes, the cage match.

1287
01:32:16,120 --> 01:32:19,840
The winner of the cage match tonight

1288
01:32:19,840 --> 01:32:24,960
absolutely no contest whatsoever whatsoever

1289
01:32:24,960 --> 01:32:27,960
why don't you announce it, Jamie?

1290
01:32:27,960 --> 01:32:30,040
angry inch is the winner

1291
01:32:30,040 --> 01:32:32,920
no, angry inch was not the winner, but close

1292
01:32:32,920 --> 01:32:38,880
way closer than i would have guessed

1293
01:32:38,880 --> 01:32:41,160
as is most of the chat room, because it didn't win

1294
01:32:41,160 --> 01:32:45,920
LOKI WINS

1295
01:32:45,920 --> 01:32:49,920
I would have put that in rotation even if it didn't win, shit.

1296
01:32:49,920 --> 01:32:52,920
Do it, see if I care.

1297
01:32:52,920 --> 01:32:56,920
No, the winner's the Great Space Coaster.

1298
01:32:56,920 --> 01:33:00,920
Alright, so Legend of Trance wins this week's cage match, and will probably win for the next four weeks.

1299
01:33:00,920 --> 01:33:03,920
We need someone to do Legend of Cumshot next.

1300
01:33:03,920 --> 01:33:05,920
Yeah, we need somebody to make one of those erotic...

1301
01:33:05,920 --> 01:33:07,920
Well, uh...

1302
01:33:07,920 --> 01:33:10,920
Get some porn noises.

1303
01:33:10,920 --> 01:33:13,920
I got porn, I can rip audio from that in some pores.

1304
01:33:13,920 --> 01:33:18,920
I got some gay porn in the other room, lots of cum shots in gay porn.

1305
01:33:18,920 --> 01:33:20,920
Jamie's all, you do?

1306
01:33:20,920 --> 01:33:24,920
Just kidding, I only have one. Irene bought it for me for my birthday.

1307
01:33:24,920 --> 01:33:33,920
I can just see it now, instead of like, the fly, you know, and the birth, it's like, ooh.

1308
01:33:33,920 --> 01:33:38,920
You know what, they've been wanting a Sky's voice remix, so I can do my voice and I can go,

1309
01:33:38,920 --> 01:33:41,920
It flies!

1310
01:33:41,920 --> 01:33:44,920
The stickiest!

1311
01:33:47,920 --> 01:33:50,920
Cream of some young guy.

1312
01:33:50,920 --> 01:33:53,920
Okay, we'll work on that. We'll work on Legend of Cupshot for you guys.

1313
01:33:53,920 --> 01:33:56,920
And then when it's all fear, it's like,

1314
01:33:56,920 --> 01:33:59,920
Ugh! Queer!

1315
01:33:59,920 --> 01:34:02,920
Queer!

1316
01:34:02,920 --> 01:34:05,920
Okay, we'll work on that.

1317
01:34:05,920 --> 01:34:08,460
be a present for our loyal listeners?

1318
01:34:08,460 --> 01:34:12,000
I almost memorized the whole lyrics for a superstar.

1319
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:13,060
Why?

1320
01:34:13,060 --> 01:34:16,920
Because I was going to do a rap and went, okay, this really sucked. I was going to do

1321
01:34:16,920 --> 01:34:21,560
a rap, okay, and they wanted, they had this thing for my work, it's a promo thing because

1322
01:34:21,560 --> 01:34:27,800
we're promoting 8 Mile, and they were doing this, like, rap-off thing, and it was so you

1323
01:34:27,800 --> 01:34:28,800
could win $100.

1324
01:34:28,800 --> 01:34:31,380
I think you actually told us this story two weeks ago, but that's okay, tell us again.

1325
01:34:31,380 --> 01:34:36,480
So I was going to do that, and so I memorized, you know, most, I got Superstar, but I ended

1326
01:34:36,480 --> 01:34:40,580
up not doing it, and a lot of our company people did it, but they made their own wraps

1327
01:34:40,580 --> 01:34:47,060
for, um, like, our work stuff, whatever. But this one guy did it off, off, um, just out

1328
01:34:47,060 --> 01:34:51,200
of the blue. He just, you know, came up with it right on the spot. That was kind of cool.

1329
01:34:51,200 --> 01:34:55,880
But instead of, you know, having the contest be, you know, where you could win $100, everyone

1330
01:34:55,880 --> 01:34:57,880
I did it and got $100.

1331
01:34:57,880 --> 01:34:58,880
Oh.

1332
01:34:58,880 --> 01:34:59,880
But not me because I didn't do it.

1333
01:34:59,880 --> 01:35:00,880
Don't!

1334
01:35:00,880 --> 01:35:01,880
Oh well.

1335
01:35:01,880 --> 01:35:02,880
That sucks.

1336
01:35:02,880 --> 01:35:06,880
Uh, what else am I going to talk about?

1337
01:35:06,880 --> 01:35:10,880
I had something that I wanted to ask or talk about and I totally forgot.

1338
01:35:10,880 --> 01:35:11,880
It slipped my mind.

1339
01:35:11,880 --> 01:35:12,880
Damn!

1340
01:35:12,880 --> 01:35:13,880
Hate that!

1341
01:35:13,880 --> 01:35:14,880
Bad radio!

1342
01:35:14,880 --> 01:35:15,880
Damn!

1343
01:35:15,880 --> 01:35:16,880
I need to write this shit down!

1344
01:35:16,880 --> 01:35:17,880
That's too much work though.

1345
01:35:17,880 --> 01:35:19,880
That's more effort than I desire to put into this show.

1346
01:35:19,880 --> 01:35:20,880
Uh...

1347
01:35:20,880 --> 01:35:21,880
As Jamie Files fails.

1348
01:35:21,880 --> 01:35:25,320
uh...

1349
01:35:25,320 --> 01:35:29,040
you that he's yeah why don't we just get to the f he's the week went on

1350
01:35:29,040 --> 01:35:30,380
as i said the jimmy

1351
01:35:30,380 --> 01:35:32,000
jimmy's nodding

1352
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:34,060
she's got to make secrets you want to say

1353
01:35:34,060 --> 01:35:36,400
you know we've been getting advice for some people because they have to use

1354
01:35:36,400 --> 01:35:39,260
always seem to go on for a long time that we ought to cut back

1355
01:35:39,260 --> 01:35:41,240
the f he's a week's like once a month or something

1356
01:35:41,240 --> 01:35:44,480
well then it would be at least the week now with a look at how long would you

1357
01:35:44,480 --> 01:35:47,900
think that would be yeah if there would be a whole month's worth of it we have

1358
01:35:47,900 --> 01:35:49,240
to do a whole show

1359
01:35:49,240 --> 01:35:52,120
We'd have to have, okay, last Sunday of each month is the FU show.

1360
01:35:52,120 --> 01:35:58,200
I promise to cut back on the repeat FUs, like for drivers and stuff, because we know that

1361
01:35:58,200 --> 01:36:01,960
they suck all year round and there's nothing going to change.

1362
01:36:01,960 --> 01:36:09,060
So you know, maybe we'd have to just instate quotas on the chatroom FUs.

1363
01:36:09,060 --> 01:36:12,200
So we'll punish you people that bitch.

1364
01:36:12,200 --> 01:36:13,200
That's right.

1365
01:36:13,200 --> 01:36:14,520
Yeah, you don't get any.

1366
01:36:14,520 --> 01:36:19,080
Come on the show and you get to be as much as you want.

1367
01:36:19,080 --> 01:36:22,120
though I have but for tonight now we're just he's we're giving you guys a hard

1368
01:36:22,120 --> 01:36:22,880

1369
01:36:22,880 --> 01:36:25,640
will do the F use like we always do so

1370
01:36:25,640 --> 01:36:29,880
sentences that used to be it uh... i'm sky mistel chat room slide i think i am

1371
01:36:29,880 --> 01:36:32,960

01:36:36,920 --> 01:36:38,840
cuz you're terrifying

1374
01:36:38,840 --> 01:36:41,120
that's let's start

1375
01:36:41,120 --> 01:36:48,120
here we go if he's the week you know you love it

1376
01:36:50,600 --> 01:36:51,600
this is all

1377
01:36:51,600 --> 01:36:56,600
all

1378
01:36:56,600 --> 01:37:03,600
uh...

1379
01:37:03,600 --> 01:37:11,600
Yeah, bad drivers. Especially old people drivers, who tailgate. I hate them. Anyway.

1380
01:37:11,600 --> 01:37:23,600
The next one goes to Sacre Mani, to our server, that always goes down. So we're moving. Eventually.

1381
01:37:23,600 --> 01:37:26,600
Yes. We possibly can.

1382
01:37:26,600 --> 01:37:32,600
So, OneDollarHosings.com gets a big finger up here. They're actually good enough.

1383
01:37:32,600 --> 01:37:34,600
Them and their stupid pirates are...

1384
01:37:34,600 --> 01:37:36,600
Yeah, ark.

1385
01:37:36,600 --> 01:37:38,600
Um, another one.

1386
01:37:38,600 --> 01:37:40,600
I've been missing Buffy for two weeks,

1387
01:37:40,600 --> 01:37:42,600
but you saved me for me, right?

1388
01:37:42,600 --> 01:37:44,600
I did. I hope, hopefully, my roommate loses.

1389
01:37:44,600 --> 01:37:46,600
Yay, back at you.

1390
01:37:46,600 --> 01:37:48,600
Um, another one goes toward me

1391
01:37:48,600 --> 01:37:50,600
for ignoring my Animal Crossing village

1392
01:37:50,600 --> 01:37:52,600
and my village's new economy,

1393
01:37:52,600 --> 01:37:54,600
but they still have me.

1394
01:37:54,600 --> 01:37:56,600
Um, happy if he does the video,

1395
01:37:56,600 --> 01:37:58,600
he'll be back.

1396
01:37:58,600 --> 01:38:00,600
And another one goes toward your village

1397
01:38:00,600 --> 01:38:03,600
Another one goes for your ability to get all the rare people.

1398
01:38:03,600 --> 01:38:05,600
I got camo prod.

1399
01:38:05,600 --> 01:38:07,600
Black cube, cute trick.

1400
01:38:07,600 --> 01:38:09,600
Cute trick?

1401
01:38:09,600 --> 01:38:11,600
Cute to penguin.

1402
01:38:11,600 --> 01:38:12,600
What's cute?

1403
01:38:12,600 --> 01:38:13,600
Penguin!

1404
01:38:13,600 --> 01:38:16,600
An Animal Crossing. We're still talking Animal Crossing.

1405
01:38:18,600 --> 01:38:21,600
I had another one. Oh yeah, another one goes for last night.

1406
01:38:21,600 --> 01:38:25,600
For me being really sick and out of it and not eating anything.

1407
01:38:25,600 --> 01:38:34,600
Another one goes toward just about every store in this town except for this one Ghetto Mart in Trader Joe's for not having Orangina.

1408
01:38:34,600 --> 01:38:39,600
Another one goes toward Oatmeal Creme Pies for being an evicted food item.

1409
01:38:39,600 --> 01:38:43,600
And then one goes toward Walgreens for not having Peach Coppellas.

1410
01:38:43,600 --> 01:38:47,600
But however, they did have Coppell by a week ago.

1411
01:38:47,600 --> 01:38:53,600
Another one goes toward a lot of stores in town for not selling balls, because I like blue balls.

1412
01:38:53,600 --> 01:39:00,600
And, um, another one is going toward, um, my socks for things to do.

1413
01:39:00,600 --> 01:39:04,600
See, I've got stuff in my shoe and they're really tight for a drive.

1414
01:39:04,600 --> 01:39:08,600
And my big F.U. of the Week goes toward jaylist.com.

1415
01:39:08,600 --> 01:39:11,600
I put in my order a month ago.

1416
01:39:11,600 --> 01:39:15,600
For loose socks and bakari sweats and soft glue.

1417
01:39:15,600 --> 01:39:18,600
Do you know what? It's still not in my house yet.

1418
01:39:18,600 --> 01:39:37,600
I bought Mega Ranger vs. Power Rangers, and Mega Ranger vs. Bingo Ranger, and that's it.

1419
01:39:48,600 --> 01:39:55,600
special music this goes for with my F.U.'s.

1420
01:39:56,960 --> 01:39:59,600
Most of these F.U.'s come from last night.

1421
01:39:59,600 --> 01:40:02,280
F.U. to Vacaville, because you suck!

1422
01:40:02,280 --> 01:40:09,280
F.U. the white trash that lives in Vacaville. I really hate you, and I don't like you coming up and talking to me.

1423
01:40:11,360 --> 01:40:15,960
One person in particular is a stupid cowboy skater.

1424
01:40:15,960 --> 01:40:18,960
You can't mix those two genres together. It's like oil and water.

1425
01:40:18,960 --> 01:40:22,960
Okay, but this jackass comes up to us, starts talking to us, puts his hand...

1426
01:40:22,960 --> 01:40:26,960
Okay, now obviously this is gonna be bad radio, but he goes up to the table and goes...

1427
01:40:26,960 --> 01:40:28,960
Hits the table and he's like,

1428
01:40:28,960 --> 01:40:29,960
How you doin'?

1429
01:40:29,960 --> 01:40:30,960
And I'm like,

1430
01:40:30,960 --> 01:40:31,960
Go away!

1431
01:40:32,960 --> 01:40:36,960
And then he kept staying there and talking to us and got into a conversation with us.

1432
01:40:36,960 --> 01:40:39,960
Eventually we ended up bringing up the DDR solo thing.

1433
01:40:39,960 --> 01:40:40,960
He's like,

1434
01:40:40,960 --> 01:40:42,960
Uh, what's a syringe?

1435
01:40:42,960 --> 01:40:47,960
Maybe if you weren't such a dumbass, you'd know what that is.

1436
01:40:47,960 --> 01:40:48,960
Then...

1437
01:40:48,960 --> 01:40:49,960
Oh yeah.

1438
01:40:49,960 --> 01:40:50,960
Oh, what about Ecstasy?

1439
01:40:50,960 --> 01:40:51,960
Like, what led into the whole solo syringe thing, someone was playing a song, Ecstasy,

1440
01:40:51,960 --> 01:40:52,960
and he goes, what's up with the movie?

1441
01:40:52,960 --> 01:40:53,960
It's like, the wall, it says breakdown, but the wall's not breakdown.

1442
01:40:53,960 --> 01:40:54,960
Why don't they just put a big flow on there?

1443
01:40:54,960 --> 01:40:55,960
You know, through the pro Ecstasy?

1444
01:40:55,960 --> 01:40:56,960
They're just so retarded the way you said it.

1445
01:40:56,960 --> 01:40:57,960
It's not like that.

1446
01:40:57,960 --> 01:41:00,960
someone was playing a song, Ecstasy, and he goes,

1447
01:41:00,960 --> 01:41:01,960
what's up with the movie?

1448
01:41:01,960 --> 01:41:03,960
It's like, the wall, it says breakdown of the wall,

1449
01:41:03,960 --> 01:41:04,960
not breakdown.

1450
01:41:04,960 --> 01:41:05,960
Why don't they just put a great flow on there?

1451
01:41:05,960 --> 01:41:07,960
You know, through the pro Ecstasy?

1452
01:41:07,960 --> 01:41:09,960
He was just really tired of the way he said it.

1453
01:41:09,960 --> 01:41:11,960
That's how it happens.

1454
01:41:11,960 --> 01:41:14,960
Then, he tried to hug Brian.

1455
01:41:14,960 --> 01:41:16,960
Aww.

1456
01:41:16,960 --> 01:41:19,960
He just wants a hug.

1457
01:41:19,960 --> 01:41:21,960
He was trying to hug on everybody.

1458
01:41:21,960 --> 01:41:22,960
And he just had this problem.

1459
01:41:22,960 --> 01:41:24,960
He said this one kid was his lover.

1460
01:41:24,960 --> 01:41:26,960
He was like, 12-year-old kid.

1461
01:41:26,960 --> 01:41:28,960
You got a problem with that?

1462
01:41:28,960 --> 01:41:32,960
He was like 17 or 18, the kid was 12. It's like Michael Jackson.

1463
01:41:34,960 --> 01:41:37,960
First of all, now you know the reason why I love this song.

1464
01:41:37,960 --> 01:41:45,960
Alright, and, finally, uh, FU2, their machine conditions at that arcade, they suck ass.

1465
01:41:45,960 --> 01:41:51,960
DVR the fifth mix fucking all the arrows are broken and max 2 the arrows are set in about

1466
01:41:52,520 --> 01:41:55,200
1 quarter inch into the pad so it's like

1467
01:41:55,840 --> 01:41:57,840
You can't play on that it sucks

1468
01:41:58,360 --> 01:42:05,300
So that's like their fucking soda machine is broken. Okay, you I wanted to fucking see your miss and I get a Mountain Dew

1469
01:42:05,840 --> 01:42:07,840
What the hell?

1470
01:42:10,480 --> 01:42:13,200
Then then to add that on top

1471
01:42:13,200 --> 01:42:16,200
For all that, then we get to Qsar.

1472
01:42:16,200 --> 01:42:17,200
Oh yeah.

1473
01:42:17,200 --> 01:42:21,200
Okay, there's, the way they have that working out there, it totally sucks.

1474
01:42:21,200 --> 01:42:23,200
They, the employees don't know what the fuck they're doing.

1475
01:42:23,200 --> 01:42:25,200
The employees aren't really working, they just put people there.

1476
01:42:25,200 --> 01:42:27,200
Their briefing room's an empty room.

1477
01:42:27,200 --> 01:42:28,200
They don't have half pay passes.

1478
01:42:28,200 --> 01:42:33,200
It's just it, it's an empty room, not painted, empty room.

1479
01:42:33,200 --> 01:42:35,200
They don't have half pay passes.

1480
01:42:35,200 --> 01:42:37,200
They don't have half pay passes, they fucking suck.

1481
01:42:37,200 --> 01:42:41,200
So, yeah, FV to them, um...

1482
01:42:41,200 --> 01:42:53,200
That's legit. That's all I had. You know, I really was trying to come up with a huge list. I had a bunch of stuff last night, but after a while at Qsar, we had some people come talk to us. They're really nice, and they made me less angsty, so that was cool.

1483
01:42:53,200 --> 01:42:56,200
Yeah, I think, right. You're a little bit like that guy.

1484
01:42:56,200 --> 01:42:58,200
Yeah, he was attacked.

1485
01:42:58,200 --> 01:43:04,200
That's it. I'm not too angsty at the moment. There could be anything close to me later on.

1486
01:43:04,200 --> 01:43:06,200
That's it.

1487
01:43:06,200 --> 01:43:12,200
My turn. I changed my song last week, it goes over paying attention.

1488
01:43:12,200 --> 01:43:26,200
My FU for this week goes to Drama, because I've seen too much of it this week, and it needs to go away.

1489
01:43:26,200 --> 01:43:32,200
One more FU and I'll give him some music.

1490
01:43:32,200 --> 01:43:38,200
Well, this is kind of funny. Let's just say I'm going to give an FU to Twen just because he thinks he's funny.

1491
01:43:38,200 --> 01:43:48,200
Twen thinks he's all cool because he went and changed the redirect on my site to some stupid toughgirl.com picture or whatever.

1492
01:43:48,200 --> 01:43:53,200
Some stupid chick shooting shit out of her ass and into her mouth, which is all photoshopped anyway.

1493
01:43:53,200 --> 01:43:56,400
Yeah, yeah, it's all photoshopped. But anyways, it's not the-

1494
01:43:56,400 --> 01:43:58,400
HAHA, LOOK WHAT I FOUND ON THE INTERNET!

1495
01:43:58,400 --> 01:44:04,600
The whole point is, I don't care, because I don't use that site anymore, you jackass.

1496
01:44:04,600 --> 01:44:08,500
What you do is, it's definitely like someone messing up my GeoCD's webpage.

1497
01:44:08,500 --> 01:44:13,400
I don't give a fuck. I thought it was funny, I laughed, and I laughed at you for trying to be funny.

1498
01:44:13,400 --> 01:44:17,000
Or just attempting to insult me in any way, guess what?

1499
01:44:17,000 --> 01:44:19,700
You ain't still getting those fucking CDs, and you're a loser.

1500
01:44:19,700 --> 01:44:26,700
So, oh, there'll probably be a little special gift for you later on on the web websites, but uh, that'll be later on, so.

1501
01:44:26,700 --> 01:44:29,700
This is a very funny video, it means I don't know all of it.

1502
01:44:29,700 --> 01:44:32,700
I know, it's hilarious, I totally, you know.

1503
01:44:32,700 --> 01:44:36,700
Did you see that bullshit in his live journal, by the way, his username is 2316?

1504
01:44:36,700 --> 01:44:37,700
No.

1505
01:44:37,700 --> 01:44:40,700
A live journal? Go read that, that's fucking hilarious.

1506
01:44:40,700 --> 01:44:42,700
He's just stupid, and he thought that...

1507
01:44:42,700 --> 01:44:45,700
I'm sorry, that was, I was just literally reading that going,

1508
01:44:45,700 --> 01:44:51,060
like oh my god how do you like be pathetic because one person can't even read i mean he truly has no life

1509
01:44:51,060 --> 01:44:58,820
you put rape from loki ah you're funny man i mean i want to know how and normally i don't talk shit

1510
01:44:58,820 --> 01:45:03,380
about people but he really deserves to be talking shit about you he's so stupid and you know me do i

1511
01:45:03,380 --> 01:45:10,660
talk shit about him no never i'm talking shit about him okay first and foremost first and foremost

1512
01:45:10,660 --> 01:45:19,660
Anyone who feels the need, they have to do impersonations to try to coerce somebody into saying something that they end up not saying anyway.

1513
01:45:19,660 --> 01:45:25,660
I'm sorry, that's so stupid. I can do a better job than that, okay?

1514
01:45:25,660 --> 01:45:30,660
If you're gonna fuck up my sight, at least put some effort into it. That was stupid. My god, shit, how long does it take to fucking put a-

1515
01:45:30,660 --> 01:45:37,660
You know what you wanna see more disturbing? You gotta think about your friend to say, if you knew where to find that fish tank, oh my god.

1516
01:45:37,660 --> 01:45:44,660
I don't think it's even more pathetic to be, to be so hated, not even in video games.

1517
01:45:44,660 --> 01:45:51,660
play as much effort than that as your fucking remixes. I mean, shit man, you need to like...

1518
01:45:51,920 --> 01:45:55,040
How about this? I'll tell you what. Why don't you go get banned from a couple more chat

1519
01:45:55,040 --> 01:45:58,840
rooms, and then you know, come talk to me. Oh wait, you can't because I banned your fucking

1520
01:45:58,840 --> 01:46:05,840
address. Oh darn. Don't give a fuck. I don't think it's more pathetic to be so hated, not

1521
01:46:05,880 --> 01:46:12,640
even in media. I don't understand why people don't like me! I'm likable! I'm a likable

1522
01:46:12,640 --> 01:46:16,240
person i should have called the prison the society's messed up

1523
01:46:16,240 --> 01:46:21,120
to suck so badly that you can't even suck in a person

1524
01:46:21,120 --> 01:46:24,560
that takes a truly defensive approach

1525
01:46:24,560 --> 01:46:29,040
sorry for taking up your questions i'm sorry that's better

1526
01:46:29,040 --> 01:46:33,600
all i have to say is you ain't bad you ain't bad i'm rolling games i'm rolling

1527
01:46:33,600 --> 01:46:39,440
games i'll go to school not kill people and and now i have to say this

1528
01:46:39,440 --> 01:46:45,440
Because I think we've gotten it out of our system, and he has to laugh every time we know his stupid bullshit comes up.

1529
01:46:45,440 --> 01:46:48,440
He's not even worth talking about.

1530
01:46:48,440 --> 01:46:52,440
He's a waste of breath, and should be put in chocolate or something.

1531
01:46:52,440 --> 01:46:57,440
So, why don't we just say, twin mill on greatness?

1532
01:46:57,440 --> 01:46:59,440
Alright, fair enough.

1533
01:46:59,440 --> 01:47:00,440
Agreed.

1534
01:47:00,440 --> 01:47:01,440
Agreed.

1535
01:47:01,440 --> 01:47:03,440
Can I do my FUs now?

1536
01:47:03,440 --> 01:47:04,440
What?

1537
01:47:04,440 --> 01:47:06,440
My FU? Oh!

1538
01:47:06,440 --> 01:47:11,000
what i think they had to go to drama

1539
01:47:11,000 --> 01:47:13,880
all right

1540
01:47:13,880 --> 01:47:16,280
other if you go to uh...

1541
01:47:16,280 --> 01:47:19,280
superficial

1542
01:47:19,280 --> 01:47:22,760
don't call you

1543
01:47:22,760 --> 01:47:27,440
i think that's it but you

1544
01:47:27,440 --> 01:47:30,000
that's why

1545
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:31,280
and i've had enough

1546
01:47:31,280 --> 01:47:32,640
uh... let's go to zero

1547
01:47:32,640 --> 01:47:34,640
Let's hear if he has any FUs of the Week.

1548
01:48:02,640 --> 01:48:09,160
you would have them oh in the fact they

1549
01:48:15,680 --> 01:48:20,800
it's like ratty-ass world industries skateboard

1550
01:48:20,800 --> 01:48:46,920
I feel that I'm justified in saying so.

1551
01:48:46,920 --> 01:48:53,920
All I have to say to that guy is, you ain't bad, I run with gangs, I'm run with gangs,

1552
01:48:55,320 --> 01:48:58,320
I go to school and I kill people, I digitally remove job in the hub in Star Wars.

1553
01:48:58,320 --> 01:49:03,320
You know what's really sad about that arcade? You can tell where they have their priorities.

1554
01:49:03,320 --> 01:49:09,320
Um, they have, you know, their DDR machines and, no, they have their DDR machines in really

1555
01:49:09,320 --> 01:49:14,320
shitty conditions, but wait, what's this in the corner? E.T. Wheeler in the giant, it's

1556
01:49:14,320 --> 01:49:17,820
It's like an actual-sized cab of an 18-wheeler truck.

1557
01:49:17,820 --> 01:49:19,820
Dude, that game's cool, though.

1558
01:49:19,820 --> 01:49:21,820
No? Why would you race 18...

1559
01:49:21,820 --> 01:49:24,320
That's like racing dump trucks.

1560
01:49:24,320 --> 01:49:26,320
Or racing...

1561
01:49:26,320 --> 01:49:27,820
Awful.

1562
01:49:27,820 --> 01:49:29,820
Yeah, it was pretty bad.

1563
01:49:29,820 --> 01:49:35,320
I played that once at, um, whatever Riptide Arcade was before it was Riptide Arcade at Pier 39.

1564
01:49:35,320 --> 01:49:37,320
I played that once.

1565
01:49:38,320 --> 01:49:43,820
Another thing, don't exactly plan on drinking from the drinking fountains.

1566
01:49:43,820 --> 01:49:48,820
You go over there and there's like hamburger and cigarette butts smashed in the drain.

1567
01:49:48,820 --> 01:49:50,820
Burger butts?

1568
01:49:50,820 --> 01:49:55,820
Alright, hamburger and cigarette butts jammed in the drain.

1569
01:49:55,820 --> 01:50:00,820
And what made it even more fun is they had the backwoods stacked backwards.

1570
01:50:00,820 --> 01:50:05,820
Did you ever see that episode of Married with Children when Al was barbecuing hamburgers and using cigarette butts?

1571
01:50:05,820 --> 01:50:06,820
Yeah.

1572
01:50:06,820 --> 01:50:09,820
And then somehow the dead mother got mixed in, I don't know anyway.

1573
01:50:09,820 --> 01:50:13,820
Yeah, married with children is the shit, by the way.

1574
01:50:13,820 --> 01:50:15,820
Were those dreams about words?

1575
01:50:15,820 --> 01:50:17,820
You'd be afraid to go your own way.

1576
01:50:17,820 --> 01:50:21,820
You'd be afraid to get in a game race or something.

1577
01:50:21,820 --> 01:50:23,820
You'd have to go step back there.

1578
01:50:23,820 --> 01:50:25,820
It would be even better.

1579
01:50:25,820 --> 01:50:27,820
They had no other sense of bathrooms.

1580
01:50:27,820 --> 01:50:31,820
But in front of the doors were arcade games blocking the doors.

1581
01:50:31,820 --> 01:50:36,820
It's like you got to go to the bathroom and get through there.

1582
01:50:36,820 --> 01:50:42,820
Hey, I have an idea. Why don't we post it to the health boards and have it sit down?

1583
01:50:42,820 --> 01:50:46,820
It's basically like TCL because they have a nice diagonal side of it.

1584
01:50:46,820 --> 01:50:48,820
Well, TCL actually is pretty...

1585
01:50:48,820 --> 01:50:49,820
Is it?

1586
01:50:49,820 --> 01:50:51,820
This thing that they're talking about.

1587
01:50:51,820 --> 01:50:53,820
I feel like that's helpful.

1588
01:50:53,820 --> 01:50:57,820
The pages might come, but the places actually tend to be TCL.

1589
01:50:57,820 --> 01:50:59,820
But I think...

1590
01:50:59,820 --> 01:51:01,820
Dude, last night's Starrcade...

1591
01:51:01,820 --> 01:51:03,820
Yeah, if it's like that, they'll call the health boards, seriously.

1592
01:51:03,820 --> 01:51:07,820
From zero to ghetto in like an hour or so.

1593
01:51:07,820 --> 01:51:10,820
This is for Irene, even though she's not listening.

1594
01:51:10,820 --> 01:51:15,820
Um, hello police? Yeah, um, I'm in a wheelchair, and...

1595
01:51:15,820 --> 01:51:17,820
Oh, actually, Loki gets better than me.

1596
01:51:17,820 --> 01:51:20,820
Oh, I'll tell you guys later. I'll take you guys off the show.

1597
01:51:20,820 --> 01:51:23,820
The highlight of the night was driving there and driving home.

1598
01:51:23,820 --> 01:51:25,820
Pretty fun.

1599
01:51:25,820 --> 01:51:28,820
I mean, the actual arena accused I was cool,

1600
01:51:28,820 --> 01:51:30,820
and that was about the only time you had fun,

1601
01:51:30,820 --> 01:51:36,400
Was when you're playing the game except me I'd wait for an hour for us to get our first game and then like 45 minutes

1602
01:51:36,400 --> 01:51:38,800
For the second one when they were standing around doing nothing

1603
01:51:39,500 --> 01:51:41,500
You seem to have that good trip to positive

1604
01:51:42,500 --> 01:51:46,020
Five teams or just go back to back back bills fine

1605
01:51:46,140 --> 01:51:53,020
It's just they have really bad organization once you if you're there and demand to go into the game. That's pretty you'll go

1606
01:51:53,020 --> 01:52:04,020
And you get the one guy who, you give them their tickets, like, their first true name.

1607
01:52:04,020 --> 01:52:06,020
There's all the members in the team.

1608
01:52:06,020 --> 01:52:08,020
It's like, I'll remember you.

1609
01:52:08,020 --> 01:52:15,020
And then you come back and you're like, man, this is crazy.

1610
01:52:15,020 --> 01:52:17,020
Okay, this is way more important than Vacaville.

1611
01:52:17,020 --> 01:52:19,020
I got corrected by Vidkawa.

1612
01:52:19,020 --> 01:52:31,520
He said, actually Peggy spilled Al's barbecue charcoal and then she told Kelly and Bud to go find some ashes for her and Kelly goes and steals Darcy's dead mother's ashes and gives it to Peggy and then Al cooks the burgers with the dead Darcy ashes.

1613
01:52:31,520 --> 01:52:34,520
That's right, because the ashes make the burger taste good.

1614
01:52:34,520 --> 01:52:40,520
But I could've sworn there were cigarettes without ashes as part of the joke. Maybe that was another show. I'm getting my wires crossed.

1615
01:52:40,520 --> 01:52:43,520
Sorry to interrupt, but you know, married to children's shit and all.

1616
01:52:43,520 --> 01:52:48,520
I don't know if I think there's an answer, but after they hear that, you're gonna have to kind of reach through the gap, do you like that?

1617
01:53:13,520 --> 01:53:22,520
I got my license like a week ago or something, and I'm happy about that, but no I don't have my car, I'm driving my brother's car. Right now I'm going home, anyway.

1618
01:53:22,520 --> 01:53:36,520
And fuck the DMV for being the biggest piece of shit ever. Oh my god. It's like you get outside and go to in line. The line is like a rollercoaster line.

1619
01:53:36,520 --> 01:53:41,520
It goes, curves around four times, and then goes outside the door, and then...

1620
01:53:41,520 --> 01:53:47,520
So we wait in line for about an hour and a half, and we're late for our, you know, service or something.

1621
01:53:47,520 --> 01:53:48,520
Then we get there.

1622
01:53:48,520 --> 01:53:50,520
Oh, you're waiting in the wrong line.

1623
01:53:50,520 --> 01:53:53,520
Go wait in that line. And there's two people in that line.

1624
01:53:53,520 --> 01:53:56,520
And there's only two people in that line.

1625
01:53:56,520 --> 01:53:59,520
And so then it's like, shit, I could be out of here by now.

1626
01:53:59,520 --> 01:54:03,520
So then after we go there, and I get my appointment on that bit,

1627
01:54:03,520 --> 01:54:19,520
Then I have to go wait another line, drive your car off, power off, wait 15 minutes, move one spot, wait 20 minutes, and then after about 2 hours I finally finish, and so the DMV fucking kicks me off.

1628
01:54:19,520 --> 01:54:25,520
FUCK YOU DMV! I'M ANSTY!

1629
01:54:25,520 --> 01:54:31,520
Sorry, I went to the one in the front.

1630
01:54:31,520 --> 01:54:58,040
Anyway, back to my FUs, another FU relating to driving is fuck old people for their shitty

1631
01:54:58,040 --> 01:55:03,040
ass driving. Old people can't drive. Old people are crap.

1632
01:55:03,040 --> 01:55:06,040
This is so cute because he's just now learning this, getting to drive.

1633
01:55:06,040 --> 01:55:10,040
Like, I knew that old people drove slow. Welcome to the driving course.

1634
01:55:10,040 --> 01:55:14,040
I knew that old people drove slow. But I didn't know that old people were this stupid.

1635
01:55:14,040 --> 01:55:18,040
Like, they drive, and they see a red light maybe 100 meters up.

1636
01:55:18,040 --> 01:55:23,040
They start slowing down, and they're going 30 at the time in a 45 zone,

1637
01:55:23,040 --> 01:55:26,040
and they start slowing down to about 5 miles an hour.

1638
01:55:26,040 --> 01:55:30,480
The light's still red, they've got about 50 meters to go until they hit the red light

1639
01:55:30,480 --> 01:55:33,360
and they're going at, you know, five miles an hour.

1640
01:55:33,360 --> 01:55:37,380
And then the light turns green, they pull to a complete stop, and then they go, like

1641
01:55:37,380 --> 01:55:38,380
it's a stop sign.

1642
01:55:38,380 --> 01:55:41,380
And then when they stop behind you, they have their, like, kind of, like, ground.

1643
01:55:41,380 --> 01:55:42,380
Yes.

1644
01:55:42,380 --> 01:55:46,380
I was actually hit, like, half by an ultra team, but I didn't want to say anything.

1645
01:55:46,380 --> 01:55:48,260
Yeah, but you ain't seen nothing yet.

1646
01:55:48,260 --> 01:55:51,500
There's also the, uh, young drivers, and I don't know if that's you, man, but, uh, there's

1647
01:55:51,500 --> 01:55:53,500
young drivers that are just stupid, like, for instance, today.

1648
01:55:53,500 --> 01:55:54,500
Yeah, I know, I know.

1649
01:55:54,500 --> 01:55:58,500
Park right here at San Juan. There's police cars going everywhere.

1650
01:55:58,500 --> 01:56:01,500
Okay, lights sirens on. There's police cars behind this dumb bitch.

1651
01:56:01,500 --> 01:56:04,500
And she's just standing there, like, she's sitting there at the red light.

1652
01:56:04,500 --> 01:56:06,500
And they're honking their horns. And she's, like, waving her arms.

1653
01:56:06,500 --> 01:56:08,500
I don't know what to do! I don't know what to do!

1654
01:56:08,500 --> 01:56:11,500
Drive forward, you fucking dumbass! You're trying to go someplace.

1655
01:56:11,500 --> 01:56:14,500
So then finally she pulls forward a little bit in front of my car.

1656
01:56:14,500 --> 01:56:17,500
And they nearly hit her ass. And I wish they did because that would serve her right.

1657
01:56:17,500 --> 01:56:24,500
Okay, anyway, back to my FUs, and I'm trying to ground for them, but I think I had a couple

1658
01:56:26,740 --> 01:56:31,740
more, um, wait, let me think, on 2DX, just fuck all the songs that I can't pass, but

1659
01:56:31,740 --> 01:56:37,420
that's not big news, and fuck Lights and Max for me not being able to pass them yet, and

1660
01:56:37,420 --> 01:56:44,100

1664
01:56:59,900 --> 01:57:03,860

01:57:07,980 --> 01:57:11,420

1667
01:57:11,420 --> 01:57:15,420
I now have a round indentation in my right knee when I tried knee dropping. Thank you Max2, I mean fuck you.

1668
01:57:15,420 --> 01:57:19,420
What the fuck were you doing knee dropping anyway?

1669
01:57:19,420 --> 01:57:23,420
Zero in the back says don't miss the panel.

1670
01:57:23,420 --> 01:57:27,420
And an added f-view to being 17. God dammit I can't even leave my friggin house. Give me a break already.

1671
01:57:27,420 --> 01:57:31,420
At least drive me to Scandia once a week. Is that too much fucking much to ask?

1672
01:57:31,420 --> 01:57:35,420
Dark Tetsuya, fuck being single. Still second the fuck to Sakomani's server.

1673
01:57:35,420 --> 01:57:38,420
And fuck simp3 play the world for not letting me play online.

1674
01:57:38,420 --> 01:57:43,420
Fuck simp3, play the world for not letting me play online, and lastly, fuck the cold that won't go away.

1675
01:57:43,420 --> 01:57:48,420
Loki, it could be worse, laser force, two words.

1676
01:57:50,420 --> 01:57:51,420
You mean laser ass?

1677
01:57:51,420 --> 01:57:55,420

1689
01:58:36,960 --> 01:58:40,400
Umm...

1690
01:58:40,400 --> 01:58:43,480
Okay. That's it.

1691
01:58:43,480 --> 01:58:44,440
Uhh...

1692
01:58:44,440 --> 01:58:49,480
Snub Disfanoi says, okay, that's too long.

1693
01:58:49,480 --> 01:58:51,120
Okay, F long things, I guess.

1694
01:58:51,120 --> 01:58:55,560
Angel says, fuck you to my cold which refuses to go away, it's been a week.

1695
01:58:55,560 --> 01:58:59,360
Black Lab says, fuck things that get in your eye and irritate it to the point that you can't see out of it,

1696
01:58:59,360 --> 01:59:06,360
fuck long ass programs that suck to code.

1697
01:59:06,360 --> 01:59:12,960
You better watch out when you're giving head.

1698
01:59:12,960 --> 01:59:18,960
More Than Jake says, fuck you to long FUs, they only make your headaches worse.

1699
01:59:18,960 --> 01:59:19,960
Sorry.

1700
01:59:19,960 --> 01:59:23,440
Evil Naoki 2DX says, I want to say fuck you to boredom, and I want to say fuck you to

1701
01:59:23,440 --> 01:59:26,440
people who upload email scripts that rape servers.

1702
01:59:26,440 --> 01:59:28,440
Oh, there's JB's FU. I didn't scroll down to see it.

1703
01:59:28,440 --> 01:59:32,440
FU did not have any cable, so I can download Azumanga Daioh.

1704
01:59:32,440 --> 01:59:34,440
Okay.

1705
01:59:34,440 --> 01:59:38,440
Let's see if we got any over the mailbox. Over at Orange Lounge Radio, yahoo.com.

1706
01:59:38,440 --> 01:59:41,440
Nope. Nothing in the mail.

1707
01:59:41,440 --> 01:59:43,440
If you can't, e-drop?

1708
01:59:43,440 --> 01:59:45,440
No.

1709
01:59:45,440 --> 01:59:47,440
Okay.

1710
01:59:47,440 --> 01:59:52,440
on the radio at yahoo.com.

1711
01:59:52,440 --> 01:59:55,440
Nope, nothing in the mail.

1712
01:59:55,440 --> 01:59:58,440
If you can't e-drop and hit the panel, then just don't e-drop.

1713
01:59:58,440 --> 02:00:04,440
You won't bitch about it.

1714
02:00:04,440 --> 02:00:06,440
Alrighty-dighty.

1715
02:00:06,440 --> 02:00:07,440
Uh, break time?

1716
02:00:07,440 --> 02:00:08,440
Yeah, let's break. I got to pee.

1717
02:00:08,440 --> 02:00:10,440
Let's break. Bathroom break.

1718
02:00:10,440 --> 02:00:12,440
What do we want to hear this break?

1719
02:00:12,440 --> 02:00:15,440
When there's something we want to hear earlier in the show?

1720
02:00:15,440 --> 02:00:16,440
Let's do a disgusting break.

1721
02:00:16,440 --> 02:00:20,640
break. A disgusting break? Like bad music break? Like lots of Eurobeat. Ooh, Eurobeat

1722
02:00:20,640 --> 02:00:26,560
break. Uh, yeah, I know, we don't want to lose all the listeners. Okay, um, alright,

1723
02:00:26,560 --> 02:00:29,720
I got it, I got it, I got it. We can do some of those shitty things from Dance Media X

1724
02:00:29,720 --> 02:00:33,760
2. Okay. Okay, we're gonna do, uh, well, what did you get though? You said I got it, I got

1725
02:00:33,760 --> 02:00:38,560
it. No, just play the... Okay, you wanna hear that? We're gonna hear, we're gonna hear the

1726
02:00:38,560 --> 02:00:43,800
Long Train run-in version by Xtreme, the band that did A Minute and stuff. Do, do let, let

1727
02:00:43,800 --> 02:00:52,800
This is not the same Long Train Runnin' that Bus Stop did, which is in Max 2. This is Extreme's version of it, and it doesn't sound a goddamn thing like the original.

1728
02:00:52,800 --> 02:00:57,800
And after that, we're going to let it go right into Bus Stop with Let the Music Play.

1729
02:00:57,800 --> 02:00:58,800
By the way, this is funny.

1730
02:00:58,800 --> 02:00:59,800
I actually like this mix.

1731
02:00:59,800 --> 02:01:08,800
This is funny. Back before we had the Cage match, and when Jamie and I were the only hosts of the show, and Loki was just a special guest every week, he was the featured player.

1732
02:01:08,800 --> 02:01:12,880
We used to pick every week songs and rotate. I think we still have our last ones in there

1733
02:01:12,880 --> 02:01:17,720
I haven't removed. They've been in there for like three months now, but we had songs that weren't in any bimani game

1734
02:01:17,720 --> 02:01:19,720
But they should be the very first week

1735
02:01:20,040 --> 02:01:22,040
Jamie had picked Shannon

1736
02:01:22,760 --> 02:01:24,760
Shannon let the music play and

1737
02:01:24,880 --> 02:01:29,140
Lo and behold now we have bus stop doing let the music play. All right

1738
02:01:29,760 --> 02:01:36,800
And then I'm supposed to play one of these new promos that some of our fans worked on so I'll I'll get that in there

1739
02:03:36,800 --> 02:03:38,800
If you're a very moving kid, you won't be coming back

1740
02:03:38,800 --> 02:03:40,800
When I'm lost

1741
02:03:41,800 --> 02:03:43,800
When will you be loved?

1742
02:03:45,800 --> 02:03:49,800
You're loved

1743
02:03:50,800 --> 02:03:52,800
Well, I wish you were here

1744
02:03:52,800 --> 02:03:54,800
If you wanna dance

1745
02:04:24,800 --> 02:04:31,800
We got love

1746
02:04:31,800 --> 02:04:38,800
We got love

1747
02:04:38,800 --> 02:05:04,000
Welcome to the Orange Lunch Radio, where pub is orange.

1748
02:05:04,000 --> 02:05:05,880
Shaving monkeys is always permitted.

1749
02:05:05,880 --> 02:05:06,880
Just kidding.

1750
02:05:06,880 --> 02:05:07,880
But...

1751
02:05:07,880 --> 02:05:08,880
But?

1752
02:05:08,880 --> 02:05:09,880
Yes?

1753
02:05:09,880 --> 02:05:11,760
Check into the plan until it poos on your face.

1754
02:05:11,760 --> 02:05:12,760
You scared the monkey?

1755
02:05:12,760 --> 02:05:13,760
You don't come in.

1756
02:05:13,760 --> 02:05:14,760
No, no, no.

1757
02:05:14,760 --> 02:05:15,760
I'll just bring Shermy.

1758
02:05:15,760 --> 02:05:16,760
If Shermy doesn't like you, leave.

1759
02:05:16,760 --> 02:05:18,760
No, no, I'll just bring Shermy.

1760
02:05:20,760 --> 02:05:22,760
If Shermy doesn't like you, leave.

1761
02:05:22,760 --> 02:05:26,760
Proceeding, as always, was brought to you by Orange Lounge Radio.

1762
02:05:52,760 --> 02:05:54,760
Get into the groove

1763
02:05:55,760 --> 02:05:57,760
Start to start the beat

1764
02:05:59,760 --> 02:06:03,760
We started dancing and love put us into a groove

1765
02:06:03,760 --> 02:06:06,760
As soon as we started to move

1766
02:06:12,760 --> 02:06:16,760
The music played while our bodies were playing all the dance

1767
02:06:16,760 --> 02:06:23,760
We started dancing and love put us into the groove

1768
02:06:23,760 --> 02:06:31,760
As soon as we started to move, as soon as we started to move

1769
02:06:31,760 --> 02:06:39,760
And I say, let the music play, we won't get away

1770
02:07:09,760 --> 02:07:11,760
Look at Dan, he's what I see

1771
02:07:12,760 --> 02:07:14,760
He's dancing his way back to me

1772
02:07:20,760 --> 02:07:25,760
Guess who's the real me? I truly love this mansion from the very start

1773
02:07:26,760 --> 02:07:29,760
Love just can't be proved, cause every time we move

1774
02:07:30,760 --> 02:07:32,760
Even though we dance the part

1775
02:07:33,760 --> 02:07:37,760
We've started dancing and love was a sin to the groove

1776
02:07:37,760 --> 02:07:46,760
As soon as we turn it to blue As soon as we turn it to blue

1777
02:07:46,760 --> 02:07:50,760
I say, let the music play You won't get away

1778
02:07:50,760 --> 02:07:54,760
Just beat the groove and then he'll somehow see you again

1779
02:07:54,760 --> 02:07:57,760
Let the music play You won't get away

1780
02:07:57,760 --> 02:08:02,760
Just do the cannonball, he won't leave you anymore

1781
02:08:02,760 --> 02:08:04,760
No, no, no, no

1782
02:08:04,760 --> 02:08:08,120
Stop, music play, music play, music play

1783
02:08:08,120 --> 02:08:11,560
Get away, this time to get away

1784
02:08:11,560 --> 02:08:16,720
Get away, you're sweet, start to dance

1785
02:08:16,720 --> 02:08:18,400
Wanna feel the music with your dying hands

I know, you ready for me

02:08:23,520 --> 02:08:25,240
Work it to the back boy, no disgrace

1790

Work it for the music, wanna get high up

1791

Let the music play, you wanna get away

1793
02:09:02,160 --> 02:09:07,640
Alright, that was Bust Off, we'll let the music play. We're going to do one more song

1794
02:09:07,640 --> 02:09:11,320

And there's another one

1809

Rising in that big red

The world falls because of love

02:12:50,720 --> 02:12:53,760
And death on the rainbow

1822
02:12:53,760 --> 02:12:58,100
We have lost the one that I've already been

1823
02:12:58,100 --> 02:13:00,800
Story

1824
02:13:00,800 --> 02:13:04,200
Ah, ah, ah, ah

1825
02:13:04,200 --> 02:13:08,100
Never ending story

1826
02:13:08,100 --> 02:13:11,300
Ah, ah, ah, ah

1827
02:13:11,300 --> 02:13:15,160
Never ending story

1828
02:13:15,160 --> 02:13:18,480
Ah, ah, ah, ah

1829
02:13:18,480 --> 02:13:23,480
The weather in the snow, I'll be in the middle of the night

1830
02:13:35,480 --> 02:13:40,480
Hello? Hello, is this thing on? Testing? Testing one, two

1831
02:13:40,480 --> 02:13:45,480
I'm looking in the index, but I don't see anything for how to run a radio show

1832
02:13:45,480 --> 02:13:51,800
I don't understand this thing works this thing reads like stereo instructions is this on the hell

1833
02:13:54,280 --> 02:13:58,160
Orange lounge radio broke down ghetto Pamani radio

1834
02:14:00,080 --> 02:14:01,480
Hi, we're back

1835
02:14:01,480 --> 02:14:06,720
You're listening to orange lounge radio as we promised during that last one that was creamy with the never

1836
02:14:06,720 --> 02:14:12,240
I was creamy with the never-ending story from dance mania ex2 so it could be a ddr very possibly

1837
02:14:12,240 --> 02:14:16,240
And of course we had some people, we had DDRholic says, it's so cute!

1838
02:14:16,240 --> 02:14:17,240
And what did she say that was really funny?

1839
02:14:17,240 --> 02:14:19,240
It was something about, God, what was it?

1840
02:14:19,240 --> 02:14:22,240
It was really funny, she said.

1841
02:14:22,240 --> 02:14:25,240
Something about hamsters dancing in the sky or something like that.

1842
02:14:25,240 --> 02:14:26,240
It was really funny.

1843
02:14:26,240 --> 02:14:27,240
I can't find it.

1844
02:14:27,240 --> 02:14:28,240
Oh well.

1845
02:14:28,240 --> 02:14:31,240
And then of course we have Arcadian says it sucks.

1846
02:14:31,240 --> 02:14:34,240
And EOSFVB says this song should be banned.

1847
02:14:34,240 --> 02:14:37,240
The song gives me an aneurysm.

1848
02:14:37,240 --> 02:14:43,240
We won't be in regular Orange Lounge rotation anytime soon, but we reserve the right to play it during any fuck-off we want.

1849
02:14:43,240 --> 02:14:44,240
All right.

1850
02:14:44,240 --> 02:14:45,240
Listless.

1851
02:14:45,240 --> 02:14:47,240
I don't think anybody did a fuck-off show this week.

1852
02:14:47,240 --> 02:14:49,240
This is the first week of Orange Lounge with no fuck-off shows.

1853
02:14:49,240 --> 02:14:50,240
Because you're having Rocky to do.

1854
02:14:50,240 --> 02:14:51,240
We have a light.

1855
02:14:51,240 --> 02:14:52,240
We have a life.

1856
02:14:52,240 --> 02:14:53,240
All right.

1857
02:14:53,240 --> 02:14:54,240
If we end up moving in together, Loki, you'll be able to do it.

1858
02:14:54,240 --> 02:14:55,240
I'm doing Tuesday.

1859
02:14:55,240 --> 02:14:56,240
All right.

1860
02:14:56,240 --> 02:14:57,240
Here we go.

1861
02:14:57,240 --> 02:15:03,240
Tonight's Listless was inspired by a thread on our forums, and if you haven't visited our forums, why the fuck not?

1862
02:15:03,240 --> 02:15:05,240
You need to get your ass over there right now and sign up.

1863
02:15:05,240 --> 02:15:12,240
The address is right in the topic of our chat room. It's also linked from our website, orangelounge.skie.cx

1864
02:15:12,240 --> 02:15:16,240
And then you just click on forums. It'll take you right there. Or if you need the website, here it is.

1865
02:15:16,240 --> 02:15:19,240
www.calibomani.com

1866
02:15:19,240 --> 02:15:22,240
slash nbor3

1867
02:15:22,240 --> 02:15:29,240
And we merged with the Naoki Boards of Randomness because they rock and we're part of their forums.

1868
02:15:29,240 --> 02:15:33,240
So, you need to get your ass over there to the Orange Lounge forums.

1869
02:15:33,240 --> 02:15:36,860
because this was an idea that came from the listless suggestion thread and who would have

1870
02:15:36,860 --> 02:15:45,860
thunk it? Dave was the one that suggested this topic. Yay! So you should go post in

1871
02:15:45,860 --> 02:15:49,060
that listless suggestion thread if you think you have an idea because we're doing this

1872
02:15:49,060 --> 02:15:55,700
one tonight. It was Dave's idea. Best warm-up song for DDR? I go first. So what exactly

1873
02:15:55,700 --> 02:16:01,340
would be a warm-up song? You don't have to name it, but describe a warm-up song. What

1874
02:16:01,340 --> 02:16:03,340
What defines a warm-up song?

1875
02:16:03,340 --> 02:16:12,340
The first song you play as a warm-up for your other songs that might be more physically demanding.

1876
02:16:12,340 --> 02:16:16,340
I think that when we say what our pick is, we should say why we like it as a warm-up song.

1877
02:16:16,340 --> 02:16:20,340
Yes. And it's basically, there goes the mic.

1878
02:16:20,340 --> 02:16:28,340
And I would basically think that it would be something very fun and easygoing and not too challenging because...

1879
02:16:28,340 --> 02:16:30,340
Just starting.

1880
02:16:30,340 --> 02:16:35,240
Yes, it depends on what you're, if you're warming up for Legend of the Max, you might

1881
02:16:35,240 --> 02:16:37,140
play Max 300, I don't know.

1882
02:16:37,140 --> 02:16:38,140
Ah!

1883
02:16:38,140 --> 02:16:41,220
Um, we have a request before we get started.

1884
02:16:41,220 --> 02:16:43,060
Angel wants you to say we.

1885
02:16:43,060 --> 02:16:44,060
We!

1886
02:16:44,060 --> 02:16:45,060
Okay.

1887
02:16:45,060 --> 02:16:46,060
That's it.

1888
02:16:46,060 --> 02:16:47,060
Alright.

1889
02:16:47,060 --> 02:16:48,060
And do the black mage.

1890
02:16:48,060 --> 02:16:51,060
Wait, what does he do again?

1891
02:16:51,060 --> 02:16:52,060
The bolt thing.

1892
02:16:52,060 --> 02:16:53,060
Nevermind.

1893
02:16:53,060 --> 02:16:54,060
Forget it.

1894
02:16:54,060 --> 02:16:56,180
Let's just, let's just get into it.

1895
02:16:56,180 --> 02:16:57,900
Alright Dave, you start.

1896
02:16:57,900 --> 02:16:58,900
Okay.

1897
02:16:58,900 --> 02:17:00,900
The first one is...

1898
02:17:00,900 --> 02:17:01,900
Oh.

1899
02:17:01,900 --> 02:17:02,900
Oh yeah!

1900
02:17:02,900 --> 02:17:04,900
I'm being lazy tonight.

1901
02:17:04,900 --> 02:17:06,900
No, Jamie, you need to memorize all of these.

1902
02:17:06,900 --> 02:17:08,900
I don't want to erase the erotic ones.

1903
02:17:08,900 --> 02:17:09,900
I'll just do it underneath, though.

1904
02:17:09,900 --> 02:17:10,900
Do it on this page.

1905
02:17:10,900 --> 02:17:11,900
Okay, here we go.

1906
02:17:11,900 --> 02:17:12,900
Sam, lick my clam.

1907
02:17:12,900 --> 02:17:13,900
No, um...

1908
02:17:13,900 --> 02:17:15,900
Okay, I think...

1909
02:17:15,900 --> 02:17:17,900
Yes, Rob?

1910
02:17:17,900 --> 02:17:18,900
Sorry, I'm just laughing.

1911
02:17:18,900 --> 02:17:19,900
I'm laughing.

1912
02:17:19,900 --> 02:17:22,900
DDRholic already gave us a suggestion for Jane Johnna

1913
02:17:22,900 --> 02:17:25,900
because it's so smooth and it makes you want to pinch your butt cheeks.

1914
02:17:25,900 --> 02:17:27,900
What?

1915
02:17:27,900 --> 02:17:37,380
My first one is Moonlight Shadow because it was really fun and I played it on doubles

1916
02:17:37,380 --> 02:17:51,660
all the time right before I played Oops I Did It Again, Fire It Up Mix, Did It.

1917
02:17:51,660 --> 02:17:57,820
And I really liked that one on doubles and it has lots of movement and it was fun.

1918
02:17:57,820 --> 02:18:00,640
We'll just go around this way, shake it up a little, because Jamie and I never really

1919
02:18:00,640 --> 02:18:01,640
go in the middle.

1920
02:18:01,640 --> 02:18:02,640
Next.

1921
02:18:02,640 --> 02:18:04,980
We always go either first or last, so we'll be in the middle this time.

1922
02:18:04,980 --> 02:18:08,660
So who's the fruit and who's the meat?

1923
02:18:08,660 --> 02:18:09,660
Gee.

1924
02:18:09,660 --> 02:18:14,340
Okay, my number three choice was, this is a fun one, La Copa Da Vida.

1925
02:18:14,340 --> 02:18:15,340
Holy bitch.

1926
02:18:15,340 --> 02:18:17,340
What's the point of mine?

1927
02:18:17,340 --> 02:18:18,340
Oh my God.

1928
02:18:18,340 --> 02:18:19,900
So change yours.

1929
02:18:19,900 --> 02:18:24,260
La Copa Da Vida because it's pretty easy to perfect attack, yet it has a lot of different

1930
02:18:24,260 --> 02:18:25,260
things in it.

1931
02:18:25,260 --> 02:18:27,500
eight notes and uh... you know what

1932
02:18:27,500 --> 02:18:30,740
people cringe when they hear a ricky martin cover but the song it actually

1933
02:18:30,740 --> 02:18:34,120
isn't that bad i mean it's it's yeah

1934
02:18:34,120 --> 02:18:36,100
did that come here at that was

1935
02:18:36,100 --> 02:18:39,140
my first choice but

1936
02:18:39,140 --> 02:18:40,580
my sorry

1937
02:18:40,580 --> 02:18:41,460
yes jimmy sherman

1938
02:18:41,460 --> 02:18:43,780
my number three pick is cockamamie act

1939
02:18:43,780 --> 02:18:47,580
cockamamie

1940
02:18:47,580 --> 02:18:49,740
how many years i

1941
02:18:49,740 --> 02:18:52,460
and a lot of people notice that i don't play with freezers i do it for a

1942
02:18:52,460 --> 02:18:56,340
legitimate reason because of my ankle being weak if I have to hold my foot in

1943
02:18:56,340 --> 02:18:59,740
one position for entirely too long especially when I'm stepping the other

1944
02:18:59,740 --> 02:19:04,580
way it hurts the thing I like about cockamamie is that it's very easy as the

1945
02:19:04,580 --> 02:19:07,860
gallops help me you know warm up my legs and everything and get my knees to where

1946
02:19:07,860 --> 02:19:11,180
they don't hurt and then it at the end of the song it goes into their run so

1947
02:19:11,180 --> 02:19:19,540
I'm building up into something better I actually have legitimate reasons good

1948
02:19:19,540 --> 02:19:31,540
My number 3 would be doing Miracle Moon on Doubles on the Heavy. Mostly because it'll work me up into doing my freestyle stuff like Let the Beat Head.

1949
02:19:31,540 --> 02:19:33,540
Do you want to specifically say Doubles Heavy or just Miracle Moon?

1950
02:19:33,540 --> 02:19:38,540
Miracle Moon Double. Because it's not very hard on Single.

1951
02:19:38,540 --> 02:19:45,540
Alright. Miracle Moon. Loki, your number 3 pick.

1952
02:19:45,540 --> 02:19:47,540
It's all about Superstar Heavy.

1953
02:19:47,540 --> 02:19:49,540
superstar

1954
02:19:49,540 --> 02:19:50,980
uh...

1955
02:19:50,980 --> 02:19:52,060
uh...

1956
02:19:52,060 --> 02:19:53,520
i knew that would happen

1957
02:19:53,520 --> 02:19:56,900
that's why i didn't put superstar stay with mexico

1958
02:19:56,900 --> 02:19:59,320
you guys were totally

1959
02:19:59,320 --> 02:20:00,360

1978
02:21:04,880 --> 02:21:11,520
My second one is Little Bitch, because not only does it match the specials shirt I just

1979
02:21:11,520 --> 02:21:18,520
got the other day, but it's a good warm up for going into my ska routine that I'm working

1980
02:21:18,520 --> 02:21:19,520
on.

1981
02:21:19,520 --> 02:21:20,520
It'll be good when I get it done.

1982
02:21:20,520 --> 02:21:24,080
So we're talking about the original Little Bitch, not Bus Stops 1-2 Little Bitch, just

1983
02:21:24,080 --> 02:21:25,080
to clarify.

1984
02:21:25,080 --> 02:21:26,080
No, the original original specials.

1985
02:21:26,080 --> 02:21:27,080
Cool!

1986
02:21:27,080 --> 02:21:34,080

1988
02:21:46,040 --> 02:21:51,040
Let's screw up tonight, all night long.

1989
02:21:51,040 --> 02:21:53,040
Okay, Dave.

1990
02:21:53,040 --> 02:21:55,040
Earth wouldn't fire, you ain't.

1991
02:21:55,040 --> 02:21:56,040
Okay.

1992
02:21:56,040 --> 02:21:57,040
I got fired out.

1993
02:21:57,040 --> 02:22:03,040
Anyway, my number one actually has a story kind of behind it, and it was a long-

1994
02:22:03,040 --> 02:22:06,040
The story is that your real number one got taken.

1995
02:22:06,040 --> 02:22:11,040
Well that, that was, it was a story for my number two, but now it's, you know, moved on up the list.

1996
02:22:11,040 --> 02:22:14,040
And because I can't think of anything else off the top of my head.

1997
02:22:14,040 --> 02:22:20,480
And it was I think a year or a year and a half ago, maybe two years, and wow, Jamie

1998
02:22:20,480 --> 02:22:25,480
is holding a lighting pen up to her forehead so she can see the lights.

1999
02:22:25,480 --> 02:22:33,960
And it was the first time that I ever met Rob and Jamie and all these other people that

2000
02:22:33,960 --> 02:22:38,720
I thought were really weird at the time.

2001
02:22:38,720 --> 02:22:45,800
I played with Rob the first time before I met him on a 4th mix at Roseville Golf Land

2002
02:22:45,800 --> 02:22:51,720
and he picked, I don't know, was it Bumblebee or something like that, you know, one of the

2003
02:22:51,720 --> 02:22:58,640
songs that my brother plays with me, and then I picked Dropout, and that's my choice, just

2004
02:22:58,640 --> 02:23:04,160
Dropout, because it was so fun, and Rob was just like gasping for breath, he's like, this

2005
02:23:04,160 --> 02:23:09,760
this is my first game. Oh my god. And I was like, sorry. And then I picked Afro Nova afterwards

2006
02:23:09,760 --> 02:23:17,160
to fuck with him. No, but Dropout because it's really fun. And yeah. Yeah. It gets me

2007
02:23:17,160 --> 02:23:22,160
warmed up, you ass. Alright. That made me think though, I left one off my list, I really

2008
02:23:22,160 --> 02:23:25,460
want to put one here, but I guess next time. But the number one, and it deserves to be

2009
02:23:25,460 --> 02:23:28,960
my number one because this was the ultimate warm up song, especially back in the day.

2010
02:23:28,960 --> 02:23:33,940
I always played this first song, you know it. This song is the shit. Oh Nick, please

2011
02:23:33,940 --> 02:23:35,500
it's not so quick

2012
02:23:35,500 --> 02:23:38,520
tried all the fighting time

2013
02:23:38,520 --> 02:23:41,620
we got the fourth makes you like oh my god i love you on it

2014
02:23:41,620 --> 02:23:43,440
i want to have a machine

2015
02:23:43,440 --> 02:23:46,620
let's see if i can fit in the coin slot

2016
02:23:46,620 --> 02:23:48,120
please

2017
02:23:48,120 --> 02:23:52,760
i actually remember you saying that once

2018
02:23:52,760 --> 02:23:59,500
it would surprise me it was right before my birthday come to think of it

2019
02:23:59,500 --> 02:24:01,500
my number one

2020
02:24:01,500 --> 02:24:04,500
Well, my original number one got taken, so my number two moved up.

2021
02:24:04,500 --> 02:24:07,500
And everyone knows that I've been starting off with this a lot lately.

2022
02:24:07,500 --> 02:24:10,500
Cowgirl maniac.

2023
02:24:10,500 --> 02:24:12,500
Just because the little skippy hops.

2024
02:24:12,500 --> 02:24:16,500
I normally suck at skippy hops, and now I can do skippy hops really well.

2025
02:24:16,500 --> 02:24:18,500
The skippy hops.

2026
02:24:18,500 --> 02:24:24,500
Because they're not the true, I don't consider them true gallops like in, you know, saints go marching or like in rhythm and police.

2027
02:24:24,500 --> 02:24:26,500
They're skippy hops.

2028
02:24:26,500 --> 02:24:28,500
Skippy hops?

2029
02:24:58,500 --> 02:25:00,500
I'll have to take that

2030
02:25:01,180 --> 02:25:03,180
Spin to disc

2031
02:25:03,980 --> 02:25:08,900
Last one Loki. What is it number one warm-up song? I played this yesterday

2032
02:25:09,140 --> 02:25:13,500
But have us fucked up this stupid fucking pad

2033
02:25:14,340 --> 02:25:15,780
moving on

2034
02:25:15,780 --> 02:25:17,340
moving on

2035
02:25:17,340 --> 02:25:23,540
Moving on from fifth mix. There's only mix it was in it was so cool and they took it out. No

2036
02:25:23,540 --> 02:25:26,380
Oh.

2037
02:25:26,380 --> 02:25:28,380
With a close second by Kongafelon.

2038
02:25:28,380 --> 02:25:29,380
Oh, Kongafelon.

2039
02:25:29,380 --> 02:25:30,380
I love Kongafelon.

2040
02:25:30,380 --> 02:25:31,380
Damn it.

2041
02:25:31,380 --> 02:25:32,380
All right.

2042
02:25:32,380 --> 02:25:33,380
So, list so far.

2043
02:25:33,380 --> 02:25:34,380
You want to read it, Jamie?

2044
02:25:34,380 --> 02:25:35,380
You want me to read it?

2045
02:25:35,380 --> 02:25:36,380
Yeah.

2046
02:25:36,380 --> 02:25:37,380
Wait a minute.

2047
02:25:37,380 --> 02:25:42,500
We have Moonlight Shadow, La Copa Da Vida, Cockaman Maniac, Miracle Moon Doubles, Superstar,

2048
02:25:42,500 --> 02:25:46,380
Senorita, It's Raining Men, Share My Love, Little Bitch, Let's Groove, Dropout, A Nick

2049
02:25:46,380 --> 02:25:50,540
Please Not So Quick, Cloud Girls, Spin the Disc, We're Fun.

2050
02:25:50,540 --> 02:25:51,540
Rad.

2051
02:25:51,540 --> 02:25:52,540
Now, songs we forgot.

2052
02:25:52,540 --> 02:25:57,540
I forgot, and it didn't hit me until part of the way through when Dave was reminiscing about 4th Mix, I forgot the qua.

2053
02:25:57,540 --> 02:25:59,540
That used to be the ultimate warmup song.

2054
02:25:59,540 --> 02:26:00,540
Yeah, me too.

2055
02:26:00,540 --> 02:26:04,540
You know what, I'm remembering my usual set on 1.5.

2056
02:26:04,540 --> 02:26:09,540
I would start off with Boom Boom Dollar, Trick.

2057
02:26:09,540 --> 02:26:11,540
Yeah, I used to play that a lot too.

2058
02:26:11,540 --> 02:26:21,540
It would always be Boom Boom Dollar, and then My Fire, and then it would be Brilliant to You OG.

2059
02:26:21,540 --> 02:26:22,540
Cool.

2060
02:26:22,540 --> 02:26:23,540
Cool.

2061
02:26:23,540 --> 02:26:30,060
No, but I was thinking about doing Synchronized Love, because it's really fun, and it's kind

2062
02:26:30,060 --> 02:26:31,060
of.

2063
02:26:31,060 --> 02:26:32,060
But, no.

2064
02:26:32,060 --> 02:26:33,780
Anyway, so I have to take one off, huh?

2065
02:26:33,780 --> 02:26:34,780
Yeah.

2066
02:26:34,780 --> 02:26:37,300
Damn, these are all pretty good choices.

2067
02:26:37,300 --> 02:26:42,620
And I play them all fairly a lot, yeah.

2068
02:26:42,620 --> 02:26:50,780
But damn it, no, no, I like that song too much.

2069
02:26:50,780 --> 02:26:55,780
I think Let's Groove goes bye-bye.

2070
02:26:55,780 --> 02:26:56,780
I don't know.

2071
02:26:56,780 --> 02:26:59,780
Too slow and not enough fun.

2072
02:26:59,780 --> 02:27:04,780
I'm just saying Let's Groove is sort of one of my cool-down songs if I need to take a breather.

2073
02:27:04,780 --> 02:27:05,780
I don't know.

2074
02:27:05,780 --> 02:27:07,780
It's more of a cool-down than a warm-up.

2075
02:27:07,780 --> 02:27:10,780
You know, I'd let the beat hit him in the same category.

2076
02:27:10,780 --> 02:27:11,780
Yeah, same.

2077
02:27:11,780 --> 02:27:19,780
I do one of those songs in between playing an extreme edit and doing my PA for Legend of Max qualifier thing.

2078
02:27:19,780 --> 02:27:26,780
These are all pretty good picks, however, I'm just a bitter little asshole, I'm taking off Dropout.

2079
02:27:26,780 --> 02:27:35,780
What the hell are you smoking? Dropout as a warm-up? I mean, I guess so. I mean, especially, you know, as the bar's kind of been raising and raising,

2080
02:27:35,780 --> 02:27:42,780
I remember when most people used to go, oh my god, you can pass Dropout Maniac, and you were like the shit if you could pass Dropout Maniac, and now it's nothing.

2081
02:27:42,780 --> 02:27:46,640
you know so I can see where it's kind of that level of warm-up so I know but I

2082
02:27:46,640 --> 02:27:49,560
mean for some people for some people I'm safe for the people that it used to be

2083
02:27:49,560 --> 02:27:52,920
oh my god I know but I'm safe for the people that used to be oh my gods now

2084
02:27:52,920 --> 02:27:59,340
it's like you have to be able to pass max 300 three-speed shuffle exactly so

2085
02:27:59,340 --> 02:28:02,220
it's like you know I can see where for some people that's a warm-up level song

2086
02:28:02,220 --> 02:28:07,400
but no and I remember the old guys sorry just for a little more reminiscing even

2087
02:28:07,400 --> 02:28:11,840
though I'm sure no one else or I doubt it maybe Bradley was there but when I

2088
02:28:11,840 --> 02:28:16,640
I was talking to Rob later, he's like, yeah, I can't pass Ninzabro either, or Ninzabro,

2089
02:28:16,640 --> 02:28:17,640
yeah, whatever.

2090
02:28:17,640 --> 02:28:21,040
And he's like, that's one of the golden cats that I can't pass, and I was like, what the

2091
02:28:21,040 --> 02:28:22,040
hell is that?

2092
02:28:22,040 --> 02:28:26,320
He's like a catastrophic, and I was like, oh, the name!

2093
02:28:26,320 --> 02:28:30,120
Because they didn't have him on fourth mix, and I'd never played a nine on third, and

2094
02:28:30,120 --> 02:28:31,120
so I didn't know it.

2095
02:28:31,120 --> 02:28:34,120
And I was like, wow.

2096
02:28:34,120 --> 02:28:35,120
The name was catastrophic.

2097
02:28:35,120 --> 02:28:36,720
But the actual little name, yeah.

2098
02:28:36,720 --> 02:28:37,720
Yeah.

2099
02:28:37,720 --> 02:28:40,080
Because they don't have the names catastrophic and all that stuff.

2100
02:28:40,080 --> 02:28:41,080
Alright, Jamie?

2101
02:28:41,080 --> 02:28:42,080
Oh.

2102
02:28:42,080 --> 02:28:46,760
Um, I take off La Copa de Vida just because I hate that song.

2103
02:28:46,760 --> 02:28:47,760
You poopy face.

2104
02:28:47,760 --> 02:28:48,760
And you know what?

2105
02:28:48,760 --> 02:28:52,640
That song, actually, it was fun in samba de amigo.

2106
02:28:52,640 --> 02:28:54,640
I don't care.

2107
02:28:54,640 --> 02:28:57,600
It was fun in samba de amigo, but sucks for DDR.

2108
02:28:57,600 --> 02:29:03,640
Did you see my routine to it, where I do the pelvic thrust of the whole song?

2109
02:29:03,640 --> 02:29:04,640
Drive you insane.

2110
02:29:04,640 --> 02:29:07,320
That's all the more reason for me not to sing it.

2111
02:29:07,320 --> 02:29:09,320
That's all the more reason for me not to sing it.

2112
02:29:09,320 --> 02:29:11,420
you're too young

2113
02:29:11,420 --> 02:29:14,100
moving on

2114
02:29:14,100 --> 02:29:15,500
take your earlier

2115
02:29:15,500 --> 02:29:16,400

2116
02:29:16,400 --> 02:29:20,140
probably take out senior eda

2117
02:29:20,140 --> 02:29:26,140
i don't really like a lot of those slides that sound like that on here

2118

favorite

2121

songs a lot of people don't like this

2122
02:29:32,320 --> 02:29:34,340
loop on the seventy third

2123
02:29:34,340 --> 02:29:37,400
i don't know if i consider that a warm-up is

2124
02:29:37,400 --> 02:29:42,900
Yeah, but not the maniac stuff, but like the easier, like the trick beginning.

2125
02:29:42,900 --> 02:29:45,400
By the way, it's Lupin the Third.

2126
02:29:45,400 --> 02:29:47,400
Lupin the Third was anime.

2127
02:29:54,400 --> 02:29:55,400
Here we go.

2128
02:29:55,400 --> 02:29:57,400
Loki, last one, what's coming off?

2129
02:29:57,400 --> 02:30:01,900
You know, I hate this song on maniac doubles, and it can kiss my ass,

2130
02:30:01,900 --> 02:30:04,400
because that is no six, bitch.

2131

02:31:38,680 --> 02:31:40,360
That's when voting's closed.

02:33:10,880 --> 02:33:22,880

Baby, baby, talkin' about baby, baby See them out on the street, but not talkin',

02:34:52,380 --> 02:35:00,380
If I could cut what you wanted to tie

2191
02:35:00,380 --> 02:35:08,380
You ask yourself who they are

2192
02:35:08,380 --> 02:35:18,380
Like everybody else, they wanna be alone

2193
02:35:18,380 --> 02:35:22,380
Yeah!

2194
02:35:22,380 --> 02:35:30,380

2196
02:35:38,380 --> 02:35:46,780

2197
02:35:46,780 --> 02:35:48,640
Holler, Stump, Stump, Stump!

2198
02:35:48,640 --> 02:35:49,640
D.C.P.O.

2199
02:35:49,640 --> 02:35:50,640
Wee!

2200
02:35:50,640 --> 02:35:52,840
Hi, we're back.

2201
02:35:52,840 --> 02:35:59,280
Jamie, do you want to do a shout out?

2202
02:35:59,280 --> 02:36:00,280
Wee, wee, wee!

2203
02:36:00,280 --> 02:36:02,800
You want to do a shout out?

2204
02:36:02,800 --> 02:36:03,800
Yes.

2205
02:36:03,800 --> 02:36:04,800
To Jack...

2206
02:36:04,800 --> 02:36:05,800
Shout out!

2207
02:36:05,800 --> 02:36:06,800
Sorry, ow!

2208
02:36:06,800 --> 02:36:12,800
My shout-out goes to Jahi for staying with me while I was going insane driving around, so thank you.

2209
02:36:12,800 --> 02:36:13,800
Thank you, Jahi.

2210
02:36:13,800 --> 02:36:15,800
My blood sugar sucks.

2211
02:36:15,800 --> 02:36:16,800
Cool.

2212
02:36:16,800 --> 02:36:19,800
Jahi is the man. He's the shit. He's awesome.

2213
02:36:19,800 --> 02:36:21,800
And he has very interesting things to say late at night.

2214
02:36:21,800 --> 02:36:22,800
Everybody needs to know a Jahi.

2215
02:36:22,800 --> 02:36:24,800
He needs to be on the show.

2216
02:36:24,800 --> 02:36:27,800
He needs to be on the show. Like, here.

2217
02:36:27,800 --> 02:36:31,800
He's been via tape, he's never been here, but hopefully soon, right kids?

2218
02:36:31,800 --> 02:36:32,800
We hope.

2219
02:36:32,800 --> 02:36:34,800
He's been talking about moving, maybe. I don't know if that would happen.

2220
02:36:34,800 --> 02:36:35,800
During a drug show.

2221
02:36:35,800 --> 02:36:39,880
a drunk show. Maybe you should get them next week. Jahi would be a suitable replacement

2222
02:36:39,880 --> 02:36:41,680
for me, because we're so alike.

2223
02:36:41,680 --> 02:36:46,280
I think that Jahi would be as difficult to get drunk as me.

2224
02:36:46,280 --> 02:36:49,600
That'd be interesting. Well, it's a three hour show.

2225
02:36:49,600 --> 02:36:53,320
A three hour train wreck.

2226
02:36:53,320 --> 02:36:58,620
Alright, you want to hear the winners of Listless? Yes you do. Best warm up song? I need drum

2227
02:36:58,620 --> 02:37:05,620
rules people. Third place! That's the most unenthusiastic. That was you slapping yourself.

2228
02:37:05,620 --> 02:37:09,500
Alright, applause, whatever. There you go, there you go. Third place is... The audience

2229
02:37:09,500 --> 02:37:15,780
is now deaf. The audience is horny. Third place is... Spin the disc, I mean. Spin the

2230
02:37:15,780 --> 02:37:22,580
disc! Spin my disc. Alright, spin the disc is number three winner. Number two winner

2231
02:37:22,580 --> 02:37:30,140
Superstar is the number one winner, and I must say this even surprised me, but it's

2232
02:37:30,140 --> 02:37:31,140
beautiful.

2233
02:37:31,140 --> 02:37:37,380
Oh Nick, please not so quick is the number one best DDR warm-up song, amazing.

2234
02:37:37,380 --> 02:37:38,560
How did that happen?

2235
02:37:38,560 --> 02:37:44,180
I don't know.

2236
02:37:44,180 --> 02:37:50,840
But it is the best, best DDR warm-up song.

2237
02:37:50,840 --> 02:37:53,200
Very close call though.

2238
02:37:53,200 --> 02:37:56,280
More than Jake's, very pissy because little bitch didn't get in there, but it was very

2239
02:37:56,280 --> 02:37:57,280
close.

2240
02:37:57,280 --> 02:37:58,280
It was very close.

2241
02:37:58,280 --> 02:37:59,280
Sorry.

2242
02:37:59,280 --> 02:38:01,640
I just explained something to Zero.

2243
02:38:01,640 --> 02:38:02,640
What did you have to explain?

2244
02:38:02,640 --> 02:38:07,160
When he said, oh no please not so quick, wondering how it got into DDR, I said, it's so small.

2245
02:38:07,160 --> 02:38:09,520
Like the Chinpoko mine episode of South Park.

2246
02:38:09,520 --> 02:38:12,040
I just explained to Zero what Chinpoko means.

2247
02:38:12,040 --> 02:38:16,160
It means small penis.

2248
02:38:16,160 --> 02:38:23,160
Alright, so Evil Naoki 2DX is celebrating by humping 3rd Korean machines across the United States.

2249
02:38:26,160 --> 02:38:31,160
Caution off of whatever version of 3rd it was, 3rd Korean whatever, that was a good song.

2250
02:38:31,160 --> 02:38:36,160
No, you know what the best fucking 3rd Korean song is ever? No, Waa.

2251
02:38:36,160 --> 02:38:40,160
Waa is the shit. No, Waa.

2252
02:38:40,160 --> 02:38:42,160
Face. Face is okay.

2253
02:38:42,160 --> 02:38:44,160
By the way, speaking of...

2254
02:38:44,160 --> 02:38:46,160
No!

2255
02:38:46,160 --> 02:38:51,160
I remember the fucking guy at Golf Land that used to be able to do Beall backwards.

2256
02:38:51,160 --> 02:38:53,160
He was one of our originals.

2257
02:38:53,160 --> 02:38:55,160
I remember that guy.

2258
02:38:55,160 --> 02:38:58,160
He used to do Beall backwards and we'd all go eww Beall.

2259
02:38:58,160 --> 02:39:01,160
He would do the perfect boy band dance to it.

2260
02:39:01,160 --> 02:39:04,160
Yeah he does. He had a perfect boy band dance to it. That was great.

2261
02:39:04,160 --> 02:39:07,160
Okay. Let's just stop the show.

2262
02:39:07,160 --> 02:39:11,160
It's alright. We're reminiscing about Beall. That's when you know we're desperate for material.

2263
02:39:11,160 --> 02:39:13,560
Okay, now we should do our other favorite segment.

2264
02:39:13,560 --> 02:39:14,760
What?

2265
02:39:14,760 --> 02:39:16,360
Ask Orange Laughs!

2266
02:39:16,360 --> 02:39:19,960
Haven't we beat this segment into the ground? Haven't they asked all their questions?

2267
02:39:19,960 --> 02:39:22,160
Let's do Storytime-a-Loki. You have a story?

2268
02:39:22,160 --> 02:39:25,560
Uh, it's something that reminded me. Yeah, I have a story.

2269
02:39:25,560 --> 02:39:27,260
Great, we get to do Storytime-a-Loki.

2270
02:39:27,260 --> 02:39:29,760
If we can do a really quick Ask Orange Laughs segment.

2271
02:39:29,760 --> 02:39:33,760
If you want to surprise and message me questions, ask Orange Laughs Sunday.

2272
02:39:33,760 --> 02:39:36,460
It's sending questions, and it'll be a really quick story.

2273
02:39:36,460 --> 02:39:39,260
And it's unfortunately not porn related, so...

2274
02:39:39,260 --> 02:39:42,420
all what fun is that sorry

2275
02:39:42,420 --> 02:39:45,900
all right so i'm not very targeted he's our plan i don't know what are we going

2276
02:39:45,900 --> 02:39:49,520
to let's uh... storytime a low-key what what

2277
02:39:49,520 --> 02:39:52,500
i know but that's art

2278
02:39:52,500 --> 02:39:56,020
whatever it doesn't matter if this is going to be so quick anyways will do it

2279
02:39:56,020 --> 02:39:58,880
with this is the funny

2280
02:39:58,880 --> 02:40:02,340
so let me go and just started with uh... i mean i was going to say guys about

2281
02:40:02,340 --> 02:40:05,500
this uh... one person

2282
02:40:05,500 --> 02:40:07,860
woman

2283
02:40:07,860 --> 02:40:12,860
She had to be in her thirties, if not older, in her forties and something like that, and she's still playing Qsar.

2284
02:40:12,860 --> 02:40:17,860
And she was like, this is what happens, this is what happens when...

2285
02:40:17,860 --> 02:40:19,860
I'm almost thirty and I have like, retarded people.

2286
02:40:19,860 --> 02:40:22,860
This is what happens when retarded people grow up, alright?

2287
02:40:22,860 --> 02:40:26,860
And they serve no purpose in society other than just to annoy you.

2288
02:40:26,860 --> 02:40:33,860
So this bitch, looking to find where she fit in, she thought she fit in with Qsar, while she was terribly wrong.

2289
02:40:33,860 --> 02:40:43,860
She sucked ass, she was playing for like five years, and the reason she likes playing is because the packs vibrate, and she likes vibrating packs.

2290
02:40:43,860 --> 02:40:51,860
And she got pissed off and we'd shoot her up, which we'd always use the tag for her, like how it was playing.

2291
02:40:51,860 --> 02:40:53,860
Because she was retarded.

2292
02:40:55,860 --> 02:40:59,860
That's not nice! And that's my story, and that's it.

2293
02:40:59,860 --> 02:41:08,860
That's my story, and she bought a pack and built her own mini arena in her house, and

2294
02:41:08,860 --> 02:41:09,860
she sucks.

2295
02:41:09,860 --> 02:41:11,860
And her name was Zap-Zap.

2296
02:41:11,860 --> 02:41:14,860
Her husband's name was Zip-Zip.

2297
02:41:14,860 --> 02:41:21,860
Zip-Zip and Zap-Zap, that's what I'm gonna name my kids.

2298
02:41:21,860 --> 02:41:23,860
So there you go.

2299
02:41:23,860 --> 02:41:27,540
Alright, we're actually getting quite a few questions for Ask Orange Lounge, so I won't

2300
02:41:27,540 --> 02:41:28,540
berate Loki anymore.

2301
02:41:28,540 --> 02:41:31,680
make him tell a better story but we're actually getting quite a few questions

2302
02:41:31,680 --> 02:41:34,800
for ask orange lounge so I get to go to a bachelor party at some point I think

2303
02:41:34,800 --> 02:41:41,160
in the next few months so have some definite stories of that take something

2304
02:41:41,160 --> 02:41:43,160
Show me. Show me.

2305
02:41:50,160 --> 02:41:52,160
What do you have behind your back?

2306
02:41:53,160 --> 02:41:54,160
Show me.

2307
02:41:57,160 --> 02:42:00,160
What did you take out of my pocket? What did you take out of my pocket?

2308
02:42:02,160 --> 02:42:05,160
What were you doing? You're not nice.

2309
02:42:05,160 --> 02:42:07,160
That was so funny.

2310
02:42:07,160 --> 02:42:09,160
That was so funny.

2311
02:42:11,160 --> 02:42:13,160
That was smooth and deadly.

2312
02:42:17,160 --> 02:42:19,160
That was great.

2313
02:42:19,160 --> 02:42:21,160
The chat room was...

2314
02:42:21,160 --> 02:42:23,160
I reached...

2315
02:42:23,160 --> 02:42:25,160
Rob had the pack of cigarettes sticking out of his pocket.

2316
02:42:25,160 --> 02:42:27,160
I don't smoke. Smoking's bad for you, kids.

2317
02:42:27,160 --> 02:42:29,160
So I grabbed it and put it behind my back

2318
02:42:29,160 --> 02:42:31,160
and then Zero grabbed it and wobbled it and goes upstairs

2319
02:42:31,160 --> 02:42:33,160
and Zero's in there and does the...

2320
02:42:33,160 --> 02:42:43,600

2322
02:42:47,560 --> 02:42:51,640

2325
02:43:02,280 --> 02:43:03,520
you might get an answer

2326
02:43:03,520 --> 02:43:05,360
but you might always like what you hear

2327
02:43:05,360 --> 02:43:09,320
this segment was born from the fact that we've run out of things to talk about

2328
02:43:09,320 --> 02:43:12,480

02:43:40,640 --> 02:43:42,720
impact

02:43:42,720 --> 02:43:44,960
by the way you know they're like a couple of sixteen-year-old girls right

2341
02:43:44,960 --> 02:43:49,400
here

2342
02:43:49,400 --> 02:43:50,640
yeah

2343
02:43:50,640 --> 02:43:56,600
I make them creamy. I have a question for you, Rob. What? Sometimes you just feel not so fresh.

2344
02:43:56,600 --> 02:43:59,400
Yeah, right now.

2345
02:43:59,400 --> 02:44:06,400
And he also wants to know, hey, what's that rash from? Dry rot.

2346
02:44:07,560 --> 02:44:09,880
You know. Alright, dry rot.

2347
02:44:09,880 --> 02:44:10,880
Moving on.

2348
02:44:10,880 --> 02:44:13,920
EOSFBB has a question.

2349
02:44:13,920 --> 02:44:18,480
Previously on Orange Lounge Radio, I recall somebody mentioning chocolate cool whip.

2350
02:44:18,480 --> 02:44:22,320
However, when I went to my local supermarket, they didn't have it, and the Cool Whip website

2351
02:44:22,320 --> 02:44:24,320
didn't have it either.

2352
02:44:24,320 --> 02:44:26,780
Can you confirm the existence of Chocolate Cool Whip?

2353
02:44:26,780 --> 02:44:34,260
I can indeed, because I used to buy it in my veal, but what I bought at Ralph's was

2354
02:44:34,260 --> 02:44:38,960
Chocolate Ready Whip in the spray can, because you can get high off of it in three seconds.

2355
02:44:38,960 --> 02:44:41,720
Okay, so Chocolate Ready Whip is what you can easily find out.

2356
02:44:41,720 --> 02:44:46,480
Now I have seen Chocolate Cool Whip, except I don't know if it was Chocolate Cool Whip.

2357
02:44:46,480 --> 02:44:48,080
I think it was Chocolate Generic Cool Whip.

2358
02:44:48,080 --> 02:44:49,080
No, Choco Kool-Aid.

2359
02:44:49,080 --> 02:44:50,080
Really?

2360
02:44:50,080 --> 02:44:51,080
Okay.

2361
02:44:51,080 --> 02:44:52,080
Interesting.

2362
02:44:52,080 --> 02:44:53,080
And maybe just continue.

2363
02:44:53,080 --> 02:44:54,080
This was a few years ago.

2364
02:44:54,080 --> 02:44:55,080
I'd like to know what EOSFPB is going to be doing with Choco Kool-Aid.

2365
02:44:55,080 --> 02:44:56,080
But I was just with it.

2366
02:44:56,080 --> 02:44:57,080
I was making ice cream.

2367
02:44:57,080 --> 02:45:01,080
I had the cream brulee in me before.

2368
02:45:01,080 --> 02:45:02,080
Okay.

2369
02:45:02,080 --> 02:45:03,080
Yeah.

2370
02:45:03,080 --> 02:45:08,360
Also, EOSFPB asks, where can I find females to say something for my porno music I made?

2371
02:45:08,360 --> 02:45:13,120
These things need to be said essentially through the word I've been using is orgasmically.

2372
02:45:13,120 --> 02:45:18,120
Always, all that I've asked have declined mentioning that they were not whores.

2373
02:45:18,120 --> 02:45:23,120
Offer to pay them money to say this word, and then they'll be like, okay.

2374
02:45:23,120 --> 02:45:24,120
What's the word?

2375
02:45:24,120 --> 02:45:25,120
My suggestion...

2376
02:45:25,120 --> 02:45:26,120
What's the word?

2377
02:45:26,120 --> 02:45:28,120
Orgasmically, I don't...

2378
02:45:28,120 --> 02:45:29,120
I'd close the window.

2379
02:45:29,120 --> 02:45:30,120
Orgasmically?

2380
02:45:30,120 --> 02:45:31,120
I don't know.

2381
02:45:31,120 --> 02:45:32,120
He just needs dirty phrases said.

2382
02:45:32,120 --> 02:45:33,120
Look my...

2383
02:45:33,120 --> 02:45:35,120
Oh, look my tongue.

2384
02:45:35,120 --> 02:45:38,120
I would say, honestly, my suggestion, yahoo.

2385
02:45:38,120 --> 02:45:40,120
There's tons of freaks on yahoo.

2386
02:45:40,120 --> 02:45:42,120
Yahoo.

2387
02:45:42,120 --> 02:45:44,960
Go to Yahoo. You'll find women that'll do anything.

2388
02:45:44,960 --> 02:45:50,180
Take that money, rent some pornos, and rip audio from them.

2389
02:45:50,180 --> 02:45:52,360
I know. This will work. Tell the...

2390
02:45:52,360 --> 02:45:53,680
It's not boner, it's boner.

2391
02:45:53,680 --> 02:45:56,800
No, I have the bonafide trick that'll work for you, OSFPB.

2392
02:45:56,800 --> 02:46:00,520
Tell the women you're gay, because then they'll do anything for you.

2393
02:46:00,520 --> 02:46:03,120
They really will.

2394
02:46:03,120 --> 02:46:05,080
Then they'll never get a date again.

2395
02:46:05,080 --> 02:46:06,520
But no, because then you go,

2396
02:46:06,520 --> 02:46:15,280
Oh, gosh, you know, as much as I love, you know, anal sex and blowjobs, I really want to try a pussy someday, and then all the way I'm gonna go,

2397
02:46:15,280 --> 02:46:17,120
Oh, me, me, me, I'll help you out!

2398
02:46:18,120 --> 02:46:20,400
Really? I'll have to remember that if I ever become single again.

2399
02:46:21,840 --> 02:46:26,400
Well, uh, you know, I'm, like, gay and all, but, uh, would you, like, uh, suck my cock?

2400
02:46:26,960 --> 02:46:27,840
Would that work?

2401
02:46:29,680 --> 02:46:32,720
I'll just pretend you're a guy. And, yeah.

2402
02:46:34,360 --> 02:46:35,080
Good idea.

2403
02:46:35,080 --> 02:46:36,280
Okay. Moving on.

2404
02:46:36,280 --> 02:46:43,280
last week's orange round

2405
02:47:06,280 --> 02:47:13,280
Q. How do you get hemorrhoids the size of melons?

2406
02:47:13,280 --> 02:47:21,240
A. You get really constipated and then try to take a big shit. Eventually after having

2407
02:47:21,240 --> 02:47:25,760
a whole life of nothing but bad constipation and trying to push your intestines out through

2408
02:47:25,760 --> 02:47:31,040
your ass, you'll grow a hemorrhoid. Also work a desk job.

2409
02:47:31,040 --> 02:47:43,040
I know this because I was looking up stuff on the internet, medical stuff, and I found

2410
02:47:43,040 --> 02:47:44,040
hemorrhoid advice.

2411
02:47:44,040 --> 02:47:45,040
Beautiful.

2412
02:47:45,040 --> 02:47:50,520
Vidpowah asks, Will my American PlayStation 2 peripherals work on a Japanese PlayStation

2413
02:47:50,520 --> 02:47:52,120
2 and vice versa?

2414
02:47:52,120 --> 02:47:56,120
Will his American PlayStation 2 peripherals work on a Japanese PlayStation 2 and vice

2415
02:47:56,120 --> 02:47:57,120
versa?

2416
02:47:57,120 --> 02:47:58,120
Yes!

2417
02:47:58,120 --> 02:47:59,120
God damn.

2418
02:47:59,120 --> 02:48:04,120
Japanese Necron for years to play Wipeout on my American Playstation.

2419
02:48:04,120 --> 02:48:05,120
So, yeah.

2420
02:48:05,120 --> 02:48:08,120
And he also wants to know, do we yahoo?

2421
02:48:08,120 --> 02:48:10,120
Actually, yes.

2422
02:48:10,120 --> 02:48:15,120
I would like to say once again the email address if you ever want to send your comments or suggestions to OrangeLoungeRadio.

2423
02:48:15,120 --> 02:48:16,120
Yahoo.com!

2424
02:48:16,120 --> 02:48:19,120
OrangeLoungeRadio at yahoo.com.

2425
02:48:19,120 --> 02:48:22,120
Yahoo!

2426
02:48:22,120 --> 02:48:26,120
23rd Magus wants to know, original or extra crispy?

2427
02:48:26,120 --> 02:48:27,120
Original.

2428
02:48:27,120 --> 02:48:33,080
extra crispy bitch I I would vote extra crispy as well sorry again if I get

2429
02:48:33,080 --> 02:48:39,720
chicken I usually pull off skin off of it anyway bad that crap sweet it's

2430
02:48:39,720 --> 02:48:49,240
nothing but flour and grease grease okay also 23 mangoes once has a specific

2431
02:48:49,240 --> 02:48:53,600
question for Loki Loki what would you do with two quiet jap girls in a bucket of

2432
02:48:53,600 --> 02:49:00,560
chocolate-ready whip. I don't like chocolate-ready whip. No, if we're talking regular-ready whip,

2433
02:49:00,560 --> 02:49:06,560
that's a whole different story. I would have them perform a wonderful little syrup tease

2434
02:49:06,560 --> 02:49:19,960
while I eat ice cream. It's two things I enjoy, syrup teases and ice cream. Oh, my God, Rob,

2435
02:49:19,960 --> 02:49:21,880
You're matching your shirt.

2436
02:49:21,880 --> 02:49:25,560
Rob's wearing this lovely red shirt that says I hate myself and I want to die.

2437
02:49:25,560 --> 02:49:27,960
And he's matching it now.

2438
02:49:27,960 --> 02:49:32,000
It's my Nikkari shirt. You're glowing.

2439
02:49:32,000 --> 02:49:35,940
That was quite possibly the funniest thing that's ever been said on this program,

2440
02:49:35,940 --> 02:49:37,120
in my opinion.

2441
02:49:37,120 --> 02:49:38,760
I would watch guys do that.

2442
02:49:38,760 --> 02:49:40,480
Okay.

2443
02:49:40,480 --> 02:49:41,920
Okay, now low-key.

2444
02:49:41,920 --> 02:49:43,960
Twenty-three Maggots has another question.

2445
02:49:43,960 --> 02:49:45,720
I do want to know, why don't they

2446
02:49:45,720 --> 02:49:48,500
serve ice cream in a fucking strip club?

2447
02:49:48,500 --> 02:49:54,500
Why don't they? Okay, let's open up a strip club, and it'll be ice cream and boobs.

2448
02:49:54,500 --> 02:49:59,500
I want ice cream and dick.

2449
02:49:59,500 --> 02:50:02,500
And on Wednesday could be like banana split night where we have the male strippers.

2450
02:50:02,500 --> 02:50:05,500
And they deserve spotted dick.

2451
02:50:05,500 --> 02:50:07,500
What? It's a British delicacy.

2452
02:50:07,500 --> 02:50:11,500
I want to make phallic sundaes.

2453
02:50:11,500 --> 02:50:16,500
I want to come up with desserts that look like, you know, anatomy.

2454
02:50:16,500 --> 02:50:30,500
No, seriously, it's very interesting. They serve, like, okay, they serve, like, you know, basically appetizer food and burgers and stuff at, like, you know, strip clubs. But ice cream, I mean, you gotta, you gotta have, like, dessert. Seriously.

2455
02:50:30,500 --> 02:50:32,500
I'm pretty sure they have good, pretty good ice cream.

2456
02:50:32,500 --> 02:50:41,500
I don't know, man. It's just, like, they serve all this greasy food and you feel sick to your stomach. You want something, like, comforting, like ice cream.

2457
02:50:41,500 --> 02:50:43,500
Okay, anyways, what's the other question?

2458
02:50:43,500 --> 02:50:47,500
The other question is, what would Rob do with two quiet jab girls and a bucket of chocolate ready whip?

2459
02:50:47,500 --> 02:50:49,500
But he's asking you what I would do.

2460
02:50:49,500 --> 02:50:52,500
What you would do? I don't know.

2461
02:50:52,500 --> 02:50:55,500
You'd send the girls over to Matt's house and, uh...

2462
02:50:55,500 --> 02:50:57,500
I know what Rob would do.

2463
02:50:57,500 --> 02:50:59,500
I know what Rob would do.

2464
02:50:59,500 --> 02:51:03,500
He would just have them stand there with their boobs out and eat the ice cream.

2465
02:51:03,500 --> 02:51:05,500
Because Rob likes boobs.

2466
02:51:05,500 --> 02:51:07,500
Are you kidding? I'd have him clean my house.

2467
02:51:07,500 --> 02:51:12,500
I need some topless maids shit.

2468
02:51:12,500 --> 02:51:13,500
Alright.

2469
02:51:13,500 --> 02:51:14,500
Okay, that's sweet.

2470
02:51:14,500 --> 02:51:17,500
Boobs are cute.

2471
02:51:17,500 --> 02:51:19,500
Uh, okay.

2472
02:51:19,500 --> 02:51:23,500
DarkTetsuya wants to know, you think the arcade would be a good place to find a girl?

2473
02:51:23,500 --> 02:51:25,500
Try the internet.

2474
02:51:25,500 --> 02:51:33,500
Actually, I met a guy who I dated for about a month when I worked in an arcade.

2475
02:51:33,500 --> 02:51:39,500
I should let you finish your story, but anyways, I was gonna say, meet women where you like to be.

2476
02:51:39,500 --> 02:51:43,500
I mean, basically, like, say for instance you're in the arcades or that kind of stuff where you're into this.

2477
02:51:43,500 --> 02:51:47,500
You'll find people that are into the same kind of stuff in those places, you know?

2478
02:51:47,500 --> 02:51:49,500
Just not home. Don't meet women at home.

2479
02:51:49,500 --> 02:51:51,500
Yeah, don't meet women at home.

2480
02:51:51,500 --> 02:51:52,500
Even if you like to be home, don't meet women at home.

2481
02:51:52,500 --> 02:51:55,500
Online is sort of okay, because nowadays you can kind of find out-

2482
02:51:55,500 --> 02:51:59,500
I met Dan, and we're celebrating our five-year anniversary this Friday.

2483
02:51:59,500 --> 02:52:04,500
But no, if online's alright, it's just risky.

2484
02:52:04,500 --> 02:52:06,500
Online's risky. Jamie took up the gamble and she won.

2485
02:52:06,500 --> 02:52:18,500
Online's kinda risky. Now if you happen to be within, say, the 18 to 21 year old range, I happen to know, because I was looking for my friend Sean.

2486
02:52:18,500 --> 02:52:27,500
On Yahoo, the personals, man, there's some crazy people out there. There's some women that are damn hot and they're wanting people to go out with them.

2487
02:52:27,500 --> 02:52:31,240
out with them except for the one chick because she was her best friends were

2488
02:52:31,240 --> 02:52:36,580
her parents but she was hot so I feel like I'd overlook that just for that

2489
02:52:36,580 --> 02:52:44,460
seriously get a college Oh college college college yeah

2490
02:52:44,900 --> 02:52:49,380
okay next question that's good good advice good scene of us find women where

2491
02:52:49,380 --> 02:52:53,300
you like to be angel says just a side question really did you ever find the

2492
02:52:53,300 --> 02:52:56,300
No, we didn't. I didn't even think to look for it this week.

2493
02:52:56,300 --> 02:53:01,300
I'm going to be cleaning up this room pretty good the next couple of days because I promised Brian I would.

2494
02:53:01,300 --> 02:53:02,300
Yeah, shut up.

2495
02:53:02,300 --> 02:53:03,300
So, we'll see if we find it.

2496
02:53:03,300 --> 02:53:05,300
But no, we haven't found it yet. Amazingly enough.

2497
02:53:05,300 --> 02:53:07,300
You guys have Game Boy games for Rob Stewart.

2498
02:53:07,300 --> 02:53:08,300
And the tape.

2499
02:53:08,300 --> 02:53:10,300
The games aren't actually in there, it's just the boxes.

2500
02:53:10,300 --> 02:53:11,300
And whatever this is.

2501
02:53:11,300 --> 02:53:15,300
It's conversion for the mouse. Anyway, moving on.

2502
02:53:15,300 --> 02:53:18,300
Let's see what's in Rob's drawers.

2503
02:53:18,300 --> 02:53:19,300
No.

2504
02:53:19,300 --> 02:53:25,300
More Than Jake wants to know. I'm not going to tell the dead baby joke. That was so two weeks ago.

2505
02:53:25,300 --> 02:53:27,300
What would you do for a Klondike bar?

2506
02:53:27,300 --> 02:53:30,300
Go to the store and buy one.

2507
02:53:30,300 --> 02:53:33,300
I know. Go to the store and put a dollar on the counter and say, give me a Klondike bar.

2508
02:53:33,300 --> 02:53:38,300
I know you've got a Klondike bar and nice titties.

2509
02:53:38,300 --> 02:53:41,300
Do you have sex with a very fine Asian woman?

2510
02:53:41,300 --> 02:53:57,300
Didiarchoholic wants to know boxers or briefs?

2511
02:53:57,300 --> 02:53:58,300
We'll start with Jamie.

2512
02:53:58,300 --> 02:54:01,300
What do you like to wear?

2513
02:54:01,300 --> 02:54:03,300
I'm just kidding.

2514
02:54:03,300 --> 02:54:05,300
Nothing.

2515
02:54:05,300 --> 02:54:08,300
I don't know, I like, I like...

2516
02:54:08,300 --> 02:54:10,300
That's kind of a personal thing to say with the answers.

2517
02:54:10,300 --> 02:54:11,300
Yeah, okay, so...

2518
02:54:11,300 --> 02:54:16,300
I would say in general, I prefer briefs on the guy, because they show more.

2519
02:54:16,300 --> 02:54:19,300
Oh, the boxers need more accessibility.

2520
02:54:19,300 --> 02:54:25,300
Oh, there was this one time where my friend's boyfriend was asleep in her bed in her dorm room,

2521
02:54:25,300 --> 02:54:30,300
and I was walking, I turned back to say something to her, and his slide was totally open.

2522
02:54:30,300 --> 02:54:33,300
I was like, you need to leave him because he stung people inside the car.

2523
02:54:33,300 --> 02:54:35,300
Oh my god!

2524
02:54:35,300 --> 02:54:37,300
I used to go in their dorm room and sniff the air.

2525
02:54:37,300 --> 02:54:40,300
And I was like, oh, you just got done, I'm going out now.

2526
02:54:45,300 --> 02:54:51,300
No, I would go in and say hi, because I would just go over there and hang out.

2527
02:54:51,300 --> 02:54:54,300
But if it had that particular smell, it would be like...

2528
02:54:55,300 --> 02:54:56,300
This smells like humping.

2529
02:54:56,300 --> 02:54:58,300
Moving on, who wants to go next?

2530
02:55:26,300 --> 02:55:32,300
And, uh, my girlfriend looks hot in boxers, so, yeah.

2531
02:55:32,300 --> 02:55:34,300
Actually, women look hot in boxes.

2532
02:55:34,300 --> 02:55:35,300
Aww.

2533
02:55:35,300 --> 02:55:39,300
Remember the 80s, though, when it was really popular for girls to wear men's boxers?

2534
02:55:39,300 --> 02:55:43,300
It's so popular, man. Boxers in a short cut-off shirt? Oh yeah!

2535
02:55:43,300 --> 02:55:48,300
I have to say, though, that getting an oversized pair of men's boxers are the most comfortable things to do.

2536
02:55:48,300 --> 02:55:50,300
Really comfortable.

2537
02:55:50,300 --> 02:55:52,300
Moving on?

2538
02:55:52,300 --> 02:56:02,300
Okay, um, on me, I particularly like boxers, but on a girl, see, I'd have to flip it around and I would say a song. That's all I gotta say.

2539
02:56:02,300 --> 02:56:04,300
Um...

2540
02:56:04,300 --> 02:56:11,300
To that note, what's so good about walking around with a wedgie? Okay.

2541
02:56:11,300 --> 02:56:15,300
As for me, neither.

2542
02:56:15,300 --> 02:56:19,300
No, um, boxers get wedgies too easily.

2543
02:56:19,300 --> 02:56:23,300
Or boxer briefs.

2544
02:56:23,300 --> 02:56:27,300
I'll go ahead and speak for Dan because I'm sure he would say this.

2545
02:56:27,300 --> 02:56:31,300
He wears briefs because he prefers to be pretty.

2546
02:56:31,300 --> 02:56:35,300
Do they make these boxer briefs? Those are cool.

2547
02:56:35,300 --> 02:56:39,300
Yep. Because you get the best of them.

2548
02:56:39,300 --> 02:56:44,300
But as far as now women's underwear thing, thongs suck!

2549
02:56:45,300 --> 02:56:51,300
Yeah, so I'm going to flip around the question and ask Dee Dee Archaholic, granny panties or thongs?

2550
02:56:52,300 --> 02:56:55,300
But there is a wide variety of women's underwear.

2551
02:56:55,300 --> 02:56:56,300
Yeah, I know, I know.

2552
02:56:56,300 --> 02:57:02,300
See, for guys it's usually either or, but for women there are so many choices because, you know, we need more.

2553
02:57:02,300 --> 02:57:04,300
We're complex.

2554
02:57:04,300 --> 02:57:05,300
Alright, let's go on to the next question.

2555
02:57:05,300 --> 02:57:12,300
go on the next question is buying underwear has to be a monumental decision

2556
02:57:13,320 --> 02:57:14,320
all right moving on

2557
02:57:14,320 --> 02:57:18,760
u s f e b do all women have bus sizes that are even numbers because i recall

2558
02:57:18,760 --> 02:57:23,380
somebody mentioning that bras only come in even numbers

2559
02:57:23,380 --> 02:57:27,660
this is funny cuz think back to the last question uh... like

2560
02:57:27,660 --> 02:57:28,840
briefs only come in

2561
02:57:28,840 --> 02:57:31,340
even numbers too and boxers and pants

2562
02:57:31,340 --> 02:57:32,860
only come in even numbers as well.

2563
02:57:32,860 --> 02:57:33,860
So the weight sizes are usually-

2564
02:57:33,860 --> 02:57:34,860
Women, all right.

2565
02:57:34,860 --> 02:57:35,860
Underwear.

2566
02:57:35,860 --> 02:57:39,860
Underwear comes in single numbers, six, seven, eight, et cetera.

2567
02:57:39,860 --> 02:57:41,860
Box sizes, though, are only in even numbers.

2568
02:57:41,860 --> 02:57:44,540
The pants sizes are not only in even numbers.

2569
02:57:44,540 --> 02:57:46,860
If they are juniors, they are in odd numbers.

2570
02:57:46,860 --> 02:57:49,460
If they are misses, they come in even numbers.

2571
02:57:49,460 --> 02:57:55,300
And boxers in briefs and stuff, they're normally 36 to 38 or something like that, so it's equal.

2572
02:57:55,300 --> 02:57:57,020
Because they're lasting, right?

2573
02:57:57,020 --> 02:57:58,020
Okay.

2574
02:57:58,020 --> 02:58:01,020
But what about bras, bras specifically?

2575
02:58:01,020 --> 02:58:02,020
I hate underwear.

2576
02:58:02,020 --> 02:58:03,020
They're all even, right?

2577
02:58:03,020 --> 02:58:04,020
They're all even.

2578
02:58:04,020 --> 02:58:05,020
Okay, I want to know.

2579
02:58:05,020 --> 02:58:06,020
No.

2580
02:58:06,020 --> 02:58:08,020
Of course, you've got two.

2581
02:58:08,020 --> 02:58:09,020
Hello?

2582
02:58:09,020 --> 02:58:10,020
Brilliant deduction.

2583
02:58:10,020 --> 02:58:11,020
Really a deduction.

2584
02:58:11,020 --> 02:58:12,020
Bros are the best invention ever because every little bit of them is adjustable.

2585
02:58:12,020 --> 02:58:13,020
Okay.

2586
02:58:13,020 --> 02:58:14,020
Like, either you got...

2587
02:58:14,020 --> 02:58:15,020
They only come in even.

2588
02:58:15,020 --> 02:58:16,020
Either you got two or you got three.

2589
02:58:16,020 --> 02:58:23,020
I want to know though why they have double D and not E.

2590
02:58:23,020 --> 02:58:30,020
I want to know why they have double D and not E. But they do sell bra sizes up to G

2591
02:58:34,140 --> 02:58:41,140
because I was watching Geraldo. And these women were on the show with these just humongous

2592
02:58:41,140 --> 02:58:49,140
These women were on the show with these just humongous knockers and they had them, no, I mean they were like the size of watermelons.

2593
02:58:49,140 --> 02:59:00,140
Yes. And they, you all need to see this, but no, they were novelty models and they were all, you know, normally sized bodies.

2594
02:59:00,140 --> 02:59:06,140
Some of them were actually too small, but they had their breasts enlarged to this humongous size.

2595
02:59:06,140 --> 02:59:10,140
They look like a bad Jojinchi.

2596
02:59:10,140 --> 02:59:13,140
Okay, I don't understand with women getting that kind of thing.

2597
02:59:13,140 --> 02:59:17,140
You know what, I don't understand, and I keep seeing these on stupid porno pop-up ads.

2598
02:59:17,140 --> 02:59:23,140
What is up with the freaking, you know, monster cock thing, okay?

2599
02:59:23,140 --> 02:59:28,140
Why do they Photoshop like, you know, zoomed in versions of cocks on these normal people?

2600
02:59:28,140 --> 02:59:29,140
Because it looks stupid.

2601
02:59:29,140 --> 02:59:45,140
They have the same thing with women getting these breast sizes that are like larger than D or double D and shit, like V or I don't even know how high it goes, but it's like you get more breast mass than you do actual women.

2602
02:59:45,140 --> 02:59:56,140
I don't know, I started watching some of those talk shows for a while, and I think after a while they just start making up letters and numbers. I'm like a QQRJ3.

2603
02:59:56,140 --> 02:59:57,140
Alright.

2604
02:59:57,140 --> 03:00:02,460
Well, you know, there's one other thing, though, about that, down the line, those women are

2605
03:00:02,460 --> 03:00:05,620
going to have some serious back problems.

2606
03:00:05,620 --> 03:00:06,620
Serious back problems.

2607
03:00:06,620 --> 03:00:07,620
Okay.

2608
03:00:07,620 --> 03:00:10,100
They're going to be tripping over their own boobs when they're 80.

2609
03:00:10,100 --> 03:00:13,700
Okay, I've got to get things moving here because we're almost to the end of the show.

2610
03:00:13,700 --> 03:00:15,140
Three more questions, no more.

2611
03:00:15,140 --> 03:00:16,140
Don't send us any more questions.

2612
03:00:16,140 --> 03:00:17,340
We've got the last three right here.

2613
03:00:17,340 --> 03:00:18,340
Here we go.

2614
03:00:18,340 --> 03:00:21,580
Streso wants to know, hey, Jamie, how about ice cream on Dick?

2615
03:00:21,580 --> 03:00:22,580
Too sticky.

2616
03:00:22,580 --> 03:00:23,580
Alright.

2617
03:00:23,580 --> 03:00:26,740
Vegas wants to know, is that your final answer?

2618
03:00:26,740 --> 03:00:33,660
Is it me or does the ferret sound exactly like the demon duck child from QQQ?

2619
03:00:33,660 --> 03:00:41,060
And lastly, Vidpowel wants to know, is Naoki really a female?

2620
03:00:41,060 --> 03:00:48,460
I guess this is a good one, I'll let one more in because this is a good one to end things on. More than Jake, 543 wants to know, why?

2621
03:00:48,460 --> 03:00:53,260
beautiful ice cream on a penis okay it's cold

2622
03:00:53,260 --> 03:00:57,380
it doesn't like the way it doesn't like how about a hot fudge sundae

2623
03:00:57,380 --> 03:00:59,860
that's fucking hot hello

2624
03:00:59,860 --> 03:01:02,220
that's like pouring coffee on your dick

2625
03:01:02,220 --> 03:01:04,080
the whole purpose of foreplay

2626
03:01:04,080 --> 03:01:08,080
the whole purpose of foreplay, correct me if I'm wrong, is to get the dick hard

2627
03:01:08,080 --> 03:01:10,100
so you can do the job

2628
03:01:10,100 --> 03:01:12,260
it doesn't cold make it shrink? hello

2629
03:01:12,260 --> 03:01:15,780
i want to know why would you need an excuse anyway? sweetie that works both ways though

2630
03:01:15,780 --> 03:01:16,860
because you know you need

2631
03:01:16,860 --> 03:01:20,940
to get the cock in the mmm haha you need to get the haha a little you need to get

2632
03:01:20,940 --> 03:01:23,060
things going down there you know you know what i mean

2633
03:01:23,060 --> 03:01:25,580
well yes i mean but i mean turn on the sprinklers

2634
03:01:25,580 --> 03:01:28,860
i think that in terms of dick

2635
03:01:28,860 --> 03:01:29,820
the purpose is

2636
03:01:29,820 --> 03:01:31,820
and for a guy the purpose is to get

2637
03:01:31,820 --> 03:01:34,220
the dick hard right

2638
03:01:34,220 --> 03:01:36,060
it doesn't ice cream defeat that

2639
03:01:36,060 --> 03:01:39,660
it seriously would unless you're going for rigor mortis

2640
03:01:39,660 --> 03:01:43,140
things have changed since the last time i've had sex it's been a while so they might have changed

2641
03:01:43,140 --> 03:01:44,820
things but last time

2642
03:01:44,820 --> 03:01:46,740
i do remember those were the rules

2643
03:01:46,740 --> 03:01:54,740
Last time I checked, I didn't bring in like a whole bunch of like condiments and fucking dessert items into the bedroom and shit.

2644
03:01:54,740 --> 03:01:59,740
I mean, first of all, okay, let's just say, say you're getting up to that point where you're gonna put ice cream on the penis.

2645
03:01:59,740 --> 03:02:03,740
You have the ice cream sitting there on the side of the bed or whatever, melting away, like dribbling all over.

2646
03:02:03,740 --> 03:02:06,740
You know how much of a mess it's gonna make? Holy shit.

2647
03:02:06,740 --> 03:02:09,740
I know, seriously. What if it's a flavor you don't like?

2648
03:02:09,740 --> 03:02:12,740
I know, it's like your favorite flavor, and it's just melted on the floor. That's kind of pointless.

2649
03:02:12,740 --> 03:02:17,400
Alright, it's time to wrap up the show, we're going way over, and the fortune cookie message

2650
03:02:17,400 --> 03:02:21,420
is three and a half minutes tonight too, which doesn't help, so we're going for a record

2651
03:02:21,420 --> 03:02:24,300
here, but that's okay.

2652
03:02:24,300 --> 03:02:25,300
Final thoughts?

2653
03:02:25,300 --> 03:02:26,300
Jamie?

2654
03:02:26,300 --> 03:02:27,300
Don't put ice cream on Dick.

2655
03:02:27,300 --> 03:02:28,300
Zero.

2656
03:02:28,300 --> 03:02:29,300
What kind of propel do you like?

2657
03:02:29,300 --> 03:02:30,300
I almost bought you some.

2658
03:02:30,300 --> 03:02:31,300
Peach.

2659
03:02:31,300 --> 03:02:32,300
Okay.

2660
03:02:32,300 --> 03:02:33,300
Peach.

2661
03:02:33,300 --> 03:02:34,300
Logie?

2662
03:02:34,300 --> 03:02:41,040
The audience is way too young to be hearing this stuff, that's all I gotta say.

2663
03:02:41,040 --> 03:02:45,320
My final thought is, the audience is horny.

2664
03:02:45,320 --> 03:02:46,640
Thank you, good night.

2665
03:02:46,640 --> 03:02:47,720

2679
03:03:27,120 --> 03:03:32,560
365 comm starts on February 13th if you access the station directly through win

2680
03:03:32,560 --> 03:03:35,760
app you're not going to be able to do that anymore this was not our decision

2681
03:03:35,760 --> 03:03:39,880
this is something that live 365 is doing to all of their stations if you're

2682
03:03:39,880 --> 03:03:43,480
afraid of signing up for registration because you're gonna get spam I suggest

2683
03:03:43,480 --> 03:03:47,060
you sign up for a hotmail account just a dummy account and send it I I don't

2684
03:03:47,060 --> 03:03:51,780
endorse spam at all but live 365 swears up and down they will not sell your

2685
03:03:51,780 --> 03:03:56,600
email address to spammers yeah and zero zero says he hasn't gotten anything I

2686
03:03:56,600 --> 03:04:00,120
don't get anything so I do believe it they're just wanting your age and that

2687
03:04:00,120 --> 03:04:03,060
stuff so they can track hey 18 year olds like to listen to orange lounge radio or

2688
03:04:03,060 --> 03:04:04,060
whatever.

2689
03:04:04,060 --> 03:04:07,660
Gosh, we have a lot of 12-year-olds listening to this station, it talks about pornography.

2690
03:04:07,660 --> 03:04:13,260
They won't sell your name, but here's what they'll do is they'll go ahead and give them

2691
03:04:13,260 --> 03:04:17,620
to the companies and then have the companies leave the money in the normal drop spot.

2692
03:04:17,620 --> 03:04:20,780
So please, you guys, stick with us even through the required logins.

2693
03:04:20,780 --> 03:04:25,100
I don't think it'll be as bad as people are saying, but it's just a change that's going

2694
03:04:25,100 --> 03:04:28,980
to happen, so please bear with us and sign up now if you haven't already so you don't

2699

2702

Stay tuned for the afterbirth.

2703
03:04:58,820 --> 03:05:01,820
Yep, stay tuned. Bye.

2704
03:05:01,820 --> 03:05:04,820

And now, here's your fortune cookie message of the day.

2709
03:05:28,820 --> 03:05:33,820
Some things in life are bad, they can really make you mad.

2710
03:05:34,820 --> 03:05:37,820
Other things just make you swear and curse.

2711
03:05:38,820 --> 03:05:43,820
When you're chewing on life's gristle, that grumble, give a whistle.

2712
03:05:44,820 --> 03:05:48,820
And this'll help things turn out for the best.

2713
03:05:48,820 --> 03:06:07,300
Always look on the bright side of life Always look on the light side of life

2714
03:06:07,300 --> 03:06:11,380
If life seems jolly rotten, there's something you've forgotten

2715
03:06:11,380 --> 03:06:17,620
And that's to dance, fun and dance and sing When you're feeling in the dumps, don't be

2716
03:06:17,620 --> 03:06:22,620
Silly silly chums, just purse your lips and whistle, that's the thing

2717
03:06:22,620 --> 03:06:28,620
Always look on the bright side of life

2718
03:06:28,620 --> 03:06:30,620
Come on!

2719
03:06:30,620 --> 03:06:38,620
Always look on the bright side of life

2720
03:06:38,620 --> 03:06:42,620
More life is quite absurd, and death's the final word

2721
03:06:42,620 --> 03:06:46,620
You must always face the curtain with a van

2722
03:06:46,620 --> 03:06:50,620
Forget about your seat, give the audience a grin

2723
03:06:50,620 --> 03:06:53,620
Enjoy it, it's your last chance anyhow

2724
03:06:53,620 --> 03:06:59,620
Some who always look on the bright side of death

2725
03:07:02,620 --> 03:07:07,620
Just before you draw your terminal breath

2726
03:07:10,620 --> 03:07:14,620
Life's a piece of shit, when you look at it

2727
03:07:14,620 --> 03:07:18,620
Life's a laugh and death's a joke, it's true

2728
03:07:18,620 --> 03:07:22,620
You'll see it's all a show, keep on laughing as you go

2729
03:07:22,620 --> 03:07:26,620
Just remember that the last laugh is on you

2730
03:07:26,620 --> 03:07:32,620
And always look on the bright side of life

2731
03:07:34,620 --> 03:07:40,620
Always look on the right side of life

2732
03:07:40,620 --> 03:07:42,620
Come on Brian, cheer up!

2733
03:07:43,080 --> 03:07:47,620
Always look on the right side of life

2734
03:07:51,440 --> 03:07:55,540
Always look on the right side of life

2735
03:07:56,020 --> 03:07:58,520
There's things happen at sea you know

2736
03:07:59,260 --> 03:08:03,060
Always look on the right side of life

2737
03:08:03,060 --> 03:08:05,300
What you got to do? Do you know how you come from nothing?

2738
03:08:05,300 --> 03:08:08,260
You going back to nothing? What are you lost? Nothing!

2739
03:08:08,260 --> 03:08:15,260
Nothing will come from nothing, you know what I say?

2740
03:08:15,260 --> 03:08:16,260
Cheer up, you old bugger!

2741
03:08:16,260 --> 03:08:17,260
Come on, give us a grin!

2742
03:08:17,260 --> 03:08:18,260
There you are!

2743
03:08:18,260 --> 03:08:19,260
See?

2744
03:08:19,260 --> 03:08:20,260
In the film!

2745
03:08:20,260 --> 03:08:21,260
Incidentally, this record's available in the foyer.

2746
03:08:21,260 --> 03:08:22,260
So much for a little bit's role, you know.

2747
03:08:22,260 --> 03:08:23,260
All right, it's a lot more.

2748
03:08:23,260 --> 03:08:24,260
Let's get to play.

2749
03:08:24,260 --> 03:08:27,260
I've done much more to live as well, you know.

2750
03:08:28,260 --> 03:08:30,260
I thought I had some more.

2751
03:08:30,260 --> 03:08:32,260
I stepped away from that.

2752
03:08:33,260 --> 03:08:35,260
I think I'll try this mansion in three weeks.

2753
03:08:37,260 --> 03:08:39,260
What do you think pays for those bubbles?

2754
03:08:40,260 --> 03:08:42,260
They'll make the money back, don't they?

2755
03:08:43,260 --> 03:08:45,260
I told them. I said to them.

2756
03:08:45,260 --> 03:08:52,260
Thank you very much for listening, and we'll see you next week.
