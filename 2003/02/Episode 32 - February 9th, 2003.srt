00:00:01,895 --> 00:00:02,756
[SPEAKER_01]: Message for you, son.

2
00:00:03,236 --> 00:00:04,057
[SPEAKER_07]: Attention!

3
00:00:05,098 --> 00:00:09,000
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you want to hear the most annoying sound in the world?

4
00:00:10,581 --> 00:00:15,625
[SPEAKER_01]: You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio, the Monty Talk, and then some.

5
00:00:19,276 --> 00:00:22,178
[SPEAKER_01]: Orange Lounge may contain adult content.

6
00:00:22,518 --> 00:00:25,700
[SPEAKER_01]: Orange Lounge may contain many four-letter words.

00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:28,982

00:00:29,522 --> 00:00:32,424
[SPEAKER_01]: Orange Lounge may contain hot monkey sex.

9
00:00:33,205 --> 00:00:33,625
[SPEAKER_15]: Just kidding.

10
00:00:33,825 --> 00:00:35,426
[SPEAKER_15]: Orange Lounge will not contain hot monkey sex.

11
00:00:35,626 --> 00:00:43,071
[SPEAKER_07]: In this episode... Hey, any balls down there?

12
00:00:43,351 --> 00:00:45,813
[SPEAKER_10]: That's the biggest bear you've ever seen, Jingleberry.

13
00:00:45,893 --> 00:00:47,974
[SPEAKER_10]: What's your favorite scary movie?

14
00:00:49,045 --> 00:00:49,666
[SPEAKER_12]: Showgirls.

15
00:00:50,546 --> 00:00:51,687
[SPEAKER_07]: Absolutely frightful.

16
00:00:51,947 --> 00:00:52,508
[SPEAKER_07]: What's yours?

17
00:00:52,768 --> 00:00:55,230
[SPEAKER_07]: There are no stupid questions, just stupid people.

18
00:00:55,310 --> 00:00:56,531
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't torture yourself.

19
00:00:57,171 --> 00:00:58,032
[SPEAKER_07]: That's my job.

20
00:00:58,192 --> 00:00:59,913
[SPEAKER_10]: Now's the time our sprockets made me dogs!

21
00:00:59,993 --> 00:01:04,617
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll get you, my pretty, and your little dog, too.

22
00:01:05,017 --> 00:01:05,918
[SPEAKER_03]: I know Kung Fu.

23
00:01:06,298 --> 00:01:08,660
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry, but all questions must be submitted in writing.

24
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:10,801
[SPEAKER_11]: Why did they have to take the word gay?

25
00:01:11,642 --> 00:01:15,085
[SPEAKER_07]: Nobody expects a Spanish exposition!

26
00:01:15,325 --> 00:01:16,185

00:01:16,226 --> 00:01:16,846

[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura Shut up!

29
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:21,690
[SPEAKER_02]: Where's my gun?

30
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:24,152
[SPEAKER_02]: This is my boomstick!

31
00:01:24,212 --> 00:01:26,754
[SPEAKER_17]: Sky Come on girls, it's time to drop the bomb!

32
00:01:27,054 --> 00:01:30,757
[SPEAKER_17]: Loki I can't for the life of me get the hooker to have sex with me.

33
00:01:30,857 --> 00:01:33,639
[SPEAKER_07]: What kind of warped human being would find that funny?

34
00:01:33,879 --> 00:01:44,688
[SPEAKER_15]: Orange Lounge Radio We are live and this is episode number 32 for February the 9th of 2003.

00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:48,691
[SPEAKER_15]: Except from Jamie.

00:01:49,721 --> 00:01:55,409
[SPEAKER_15]: You're tuned into the B-Money Scene's most slutty radio station of all things B-Money.

00:01:58,183 --> 00:02:00,404
[SPEAKER_15]: My name is Rob Roberts, for you who might know me as Sky.

00:02:01,184 --> 00:02:05,405
[SPEAKER_15]: Joining me as always are my awesome co-hosts in this corner, the happiest bunny on the farm, Miss Jamie Summers.

[SPEAKER_15]: You know her as DarkSakura.

41
00:02:06,986 --> 00:02:09,306
[SPEAKER_18]: I've had lots of coffee, ha ha ha ha ha.

42
00:02:09,446 --> 00:02:13,167
[SPEAKER_15]: In that corner, say hello to our tack, tack, tack, our tack master.

43
00:02:14,108 --> 00:02:16,568
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a tack, tack chick.

44
00:02:16,629 --> 00:02:17,569
[SPEAKER_15]: No, you're tack's bitch.

45
00:02:18,029 --> 00:02:19,769
[SPEAKER_15]: It's, uh, hello, our mics went off.

46
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:21,090
[SPEAKER_15]: You're tack's bitch.

47
00:02:22,690 --> 00:02:24,471
[SPEAKER_18]: Rob, anything going off in your hands is natural.

48
00:02:26,363 --> 00:02:27,884
[SPEAKER_15]: Say hello to our tech master, Loki.

00:02:29,146 --> 00:02:29,366
[SPEAKER_15]: Hug.

00:02:29,566 --> 00:02:30,687
[SPEAKER_15]: Hug.

00:02:30,787 --> 00:02:31,007
[SPEAKER_15]: Hug.

52
00:02:31,268 --> 00:02:31,468
[SPEAKER_15]: Hug.

53
00:02:31,608 --> 00:02:33,189
[SPEAKER_15]: Don't look at me like I'm freaking Frankenstein.

54
00:02:33,229 --> 00:02:33,710
[SPEAKER_15]: Give me a hug.

55
00:02:33,970 --> 00:02:34,190
[SPEAKER_15]: Hug.

[SPEAKER_15]: Also known as Matt.

57
00:02:36,152 --> 00:02:38,474
[SPEAKER_15]: We haven't come up with a stage name for Matt yet.

58
00:02:38,614 --> 00:02:39,695
[SPEAKER_15]: We don't want to use his real life.

59
00:02:40,096 --> 00:02:40,716
[SPEAKER_02]: He's the Matt.

60
00:02:41,617 --> 00:02:42,298
[SPEAKER_15]: He's the Matt.

61
00:02:42,638 --> 00:02:43,198
[SPEAKER_15]: He's just Matt.

62
00:02:43,439 --> 00:02:44,219
[SPEAKER_15]: He's like Cher.

63
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:45,380
[SPEAKER_15]: Only one word.

64
00:02:45,681 --> 00:02:46,461
[SPEAKER_15]: Only one word name.

65
00:02:47,282 --> 00:02:47,663
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

66
00:02:49,938 --> 00:02:54,548
[SPEAKER_15]: Also with us tonight, say hello, we've got tons of guests here with us tonight.

[SPEAKER_15]: Say hello to Zero in the corner.

68
00:02:58,823 --> 00:03:00,344
[SPEAKER_15]: Hi, Zero, how are you doing?

69
00:03:03,044 --> 00:03:03,404
[SPEAKER_15]: My bad.

70
00:03:03,665 --> 00:03:04,625
[SPEAKER_15]: I went too far back in the intro.

71
00:03:05,245 --> 00:03:07,146
[SPEAKER_15]: Also, we've got... Wait, we'll do him last.

72
00:03:07,466 --> 00:03:10,107
[SPEAKER_15]: We've got Dave's back after a long time.

73
00:03:10,187 --> 00:03:11,167
[SPEAKER_15]: Hey, Scott, say hello.

74
00:03:12,127 --> 00:03:12,407
[SPEAKER_15]: Hello.

75
00:03:13,768 --> 00:03:15,328
[SPEAKER_15]: Scott's one of the Rocky Horror folks.

76
00:03:15,348 --> 00:03:15,628
[SPEAKER_15]: He's here.

77
00:03:15,828 --> 00:03:17,029
[SPEAKER_15]: You brought back my TV, yes?

78
00:03:17,509 --> 00:03:18,149
[SPEAKER_15]: Good, thank you.

79
00:03:18,269 --> 00:03:19,350
[SPEAKER_15]: Now we can play Animal Crossing again.

80
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:21,070
[SPEAKER_15]: He's eating nuts.

81
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:22,971
[SPEAKER_15]: Also here, Brad.

82
00:03:27,885 --> 00:03:30,313
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, EOSFBB has a great stage name for Matt.

83
00:03:30,534 --> 00:03:31,938
[SPEAKER_15]: His name could be Matt Comes A Lot.

84
00:03:34,244 --> 00:03:35,024
[SPEAKER_15]: How does he know?

85
00:03:36,045 --> 00:03:41,046
[SPEAKER_15]: I almost read that as come slut, but... Oops, my bad.

86
00:03:41,286 --> 00:03:53,970
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, and also, way in the back corner, one of my bestest friends in the whole wide world who doesn't know shit about these DDR games, but that's why we love having people on this show that aren't really into these games.

87
00:03:54,090 --> 00:03:58,011
[SPEAKER_15]: They just sit here in horror at this... They do a radio thing on the internet these days?

88
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:58,920
[SPEAKER_13]: Say hello to Billy!

89
00:03:59,160 --> 00:03:59,800
[SPEAKER_13]: Hello.

90
00:04:00,741 --> 00:04:01,921
[SPEAKER_13]: How are you, gentlemen?

91
00:04:02,161 --> 00:04:02,801
[SPEAKER_13]: Very good.

92
00:04:04,042 --> 00:04:05,322
[SPEAKER_13]: I kicked you in the foot.

93
00:04:07,983 --> 00:04:09,003
[SPEAKER_13]: I kicked you in the foot!

94
00:04:10,123 --> 00:04:10,903
[SPEAKER_13]: Not in the foot!

95
00:04:11,343 --> 00:04:12,444
[SPEAKER_13]: I kicked you in the balls!

96
00:04:13,144 --> 00:04:14,044
[SPEAKER_13]: Not in the balls!

97
00:04:16,925 --> 00:04:18,005
[SPEAKER_13]: Are you spitting the nut?

98
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:20,346
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm spitting my nut.

99
00:04:21,618 --> 00:04:26,240
[SPEAKER_15]: We'll be talking to everybody more a little bit later, but first we're going to take a quick break.

100
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:29,120
[SPEAKER_15]: And any other thoughts from the opening panel?

101
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:31,101
[SPEAKER_15]: Will I tune something up?

102
00:04:31,221 --> 00:04:32,662
[SPEAKER_15]: Cue something up, I should say?

103
00:04:32,682 --> 00:04:33,722
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll play you some TAC.

104
00:04:34,282 --> 00:04:35,062
[SPEAKER_15]: Play you some TAC?

105
00:04:35,343 --> 00:04:40,404
[SPEAKER_15]: How about first we're going to do something from Dance Mania EX3.

106
00:04:40,484 --> 00:04:42,265
[SPEAKER_15]: Brand new Dance Mania album that just came out.

107
00:04:42,285 --> 00:04:43,365
[SPEAKER_15]: We're going to play something from that.

108
00:04:43,605 --> 00:04:44,546
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm sorry, EX2.

109
00:04:44,626 --> 00:04:45,726
[SPEAKER_15]: My bad, my bad, my bad.

110
00:04:45,906 --> 00:04:47,707
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll take the Rapist for 500.

111
00:04:47,807 --> 00:04:48,427
[SPEAKER_15]: We're going to play...

112
00:04:49,821 --> 00:04:52,564
[SPEAKER_15]: We're going to start this break off with Erotic, and then Tack.

113
00:04:52,584 --> 00:04:53,485
[SPEAKER_15]: We'll do Erotic, then Tack.

114
00:04:53,505 --> 00:04:53,846
[SPEAKER_15]: How's that?

115
00:04:54,306 --> 00:04:54,547
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright.

116
00:04:54,867 --> 00:04:55,908
[SPEAKER_15]: We're going to do Erotic.

117
00:04:55,988 --> 00:04:59,272
[SPEAKER_15]: This is Fred Come to Bed, the 2003 mix.

118
00:05:00,233 --> 00:05:02,596
[SPEAKER_15]: Word, and it sounds just like Max Don't Have Sex With You Guys.

119
00:05:02,776 --> 00:05:04,138
[SPEAKER_15]: Because all Erotic songs sound the same.

120
00:05:04,158 --> 00:05:05,540
[SPEAKER_15]: So we're going to play this.

121
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:06,641
[SPEAKER_18]: Sorry, this doesn't sound like Erotic.

122
00:05:07,335 --> 00:05:09,335
[SPEAKER_15]: Because Charlene is actually missing heart.

123
00:05:10,256 --> 00:05:10,416
[SPEAKER_12]: Wait.

124
00:05:10,436 --> 00:05:11,056
[SPEAKER_15]: I found that out.

125
00:05:11,796 --> 00:05:13,216
[SPEAKER_15]: Does he have the flute part?

126
00:05:13,296 --> 00:05:13,616
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know.

127
00:05:13,656 --> 00:05:14,236
[SPEAKER_15]: We'll find out.

128
00:05:14,256 --> 00:05:15,196
[SPEAKER_15]: Because that part kicks ass.

129
00:05:15,316 --> 00:05:16,117
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, we're going to play it right now.

130
00:05:16,137 --> 00:05:18,637
[SPEAKER_15]: We're going to play Fred Come to Bed, then we're going to do something tack, and then we'll be back.

131
00:05:19,337 --> 00:05:20,597
[SPEAKER_15]: We are doing the match game tonight.

132
00:05:20,637 --> 00:05:21,978
[SPEAKER_15]: We're going to do it kind of early in the show.

133
00:05:22,558 --> 00:05:23,858
[SPEAKER_15]: Probably first or second segment.

134
00:05:23,878 --> 00:05:29,179
[SPEAKER_15]: When we come back, actually, we want to talk about the pre-show and something, a new contest we're going to do that relates to the pre-show we did tonight.

135
00:05:29,279 --> 00:05:29,799
[SPEAKER_02]: And porn.

136
00:05:30,219 --> 00:05:32,319
[SPEAKER_15]: And porn, of course, because we are Orange Lounge Radio.

137
00:05:32,339 --> 00:05:34,420
[SPEAKER_15]: But we'll be right back.

138
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:35,200
[SPEAKER_15]: Thanks for tuning in.

139
00:05:38,417 --> 00:05:38,978
Thanks for watching!

140
00:07:50,738 --> 00:07:56,925
[SPEAKER_05]: Come to bed, cause my max had sex with a sexy ex-old friend

141
00:11:01,155 --> 00:11:10,119
[SPEAKER_01]: And now it's time for Erotic Pop Idol, where we will find the next singer for everyone's favorite perverse Bomani band, Erotic.

142
00:11:10,559 --> 00:11:11,479
[SPEAKER_00]: Do it all night.

143
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:12,580
[SPEAKER_00]: Do it with me.

144
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,461
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, that was awful.

145
00:11:14,541 --> 00:11:15,421
[SPEAKER_00]: Bloody terrible.

146
00:11:15,461 --> 00:11:16,802
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you take vocal lessons?

147
00:11:16,882 --> 00:11:17,862
[SPEAKER_00]: Kill your teacher.

148
00:11:18,362 --> 00:11:19,363
[SPEAKER_00]: In the heat of the night.

149
00:11:19,823 --> 00:11:22,064
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, God, I think my ears are bleeding.

150
00:11:23,244 --> 00:11:23,905
[SPEAKER_06]: I liked it.

151
00:11:24,425 --> 00:11:25,966
[SPEAKER_13]: Shut the bloody hell up, Paula.

152
00:11:26,086 --> 00:11:26,506
[SPEAKER_13]: Next.

153
00:11:29,623 --> 00:11:30,863
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, that was cool.

154
00:11:32,263 --> 00:11:34,044
[SPEAKER_13]: Do you even know why you're here?

155
00:11:34,124 --> 00:11:35,804
[SPEAKER_13]: That was just bloody pathetic.

156
00:11:35,884 --> 00:11:36,344
[SPEAKER_00]: Next!

157
00:11:37,745 --> 00:11:40,766
[SPEAKER_07]: Come on, do it with me.

158
00:11:41,706 --> 00:11:42,966
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, yes, that's it!

159
00:11:43,326 --> 00:11:44,487
[SPEAKER_15]: We have a winner!

160
00:11:45,287 --> 00:11:49,148
[SPEAKER_01]: A Star is Born, here on Orange Lounge Radio.

161
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:52,156
[SPEAKER_15]: A star is born here on Orange Lounge Radio.

162
00:11:52,176 --> 00:11:53,278
[SPEAKER_05]: You say that every fucking time.

163
00:11:53,318 --> 00:11:54,722
[SPEAKER_15]: I know, that's why I have to say it.

164
00:11:54,962 --> 00:11:56,386
[SPEAKER_15]: Because Dave pointed that out one day.

165
00:11:56,426 --> 00:11:58,931
[SPEAKER_05]: You say that every goddamn time you play at Provo!

166
00:11:59,952 --> 00:12:01,194
[SPEAKER_12]: I didn't say it in that tone though

167
00:12:21,156 --> 00:12:21,996
[SPEAKER_15]: Everybody watch the American Idol.

168
00:12:22,036 --> 00:12:22,677
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, we're going to start.

169
00:12:22,697 --> 00:12:24,658
[SPEAKER_02]: We need our funky 70s porn music.

170
00:12:24,678 --> 00:12:29,800
[SPEAKER_15]: We're going to start off with the match game first thing here tonight, but we're going to need to get some contestants.

171
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:35,222
[SPEAKER_15]: So the trivia question we're asking tonight to get some contestants for the match game.

172
00:12:35,262 --> 00:12:37,303
[SPEAKER_15]: You got something that people will get pretty easy.

173
00:12:37,643 --> 00:12:38,024
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

174
00:12:39,544 --> 00:12:41,425
[SPEAKER_15]: First two people to private message me the answer.

175
00:12:41,785 --> 00:12:44,306
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm known in the chat room tonight as Sky Chat Room Slut.

176
00:12:45,087 --> 00:12:46,287
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, this is a question.

177
00:12:46,707 --> 00:12:48,088
[SPEAKER_02]: It's actually a trivia question about myself.

178
00:12:49,923 --> 00:12:53,825
[SPEAKER_02]: What is the one beverage... No, I can't do that.

179
00:12:53,885 --> 00:12:54,105
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

180
00:12:57,126 --> 00:12:59,607
[SPEAKER_15]: First two people with the correct answer are our contestants tonight.

181
00:12:59,627 --> 00:13:01,208
[SPEAKER_02]: What is Jamie's favorite tax song?

182
00:13:02,643 --> 00:13:04,104
[SPEAKER_15]: Ooh, that's going to be a hard one, don't you think?

183
00:13:04,885 --> 00:13:05,985
[SPEAKER_15]: If they pay attention, you think?

184
00:13:06,005 --> 00:13:06,946
[SPEAKER_02]: If they pay attention, I'll get it.

185
00:13:06,966 --> 00:13:09,668
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright, Jamie's favorite tax song.

186
00:13:10,148 --> 00:13:11,949
[SPEAKER_15]: Send it to me over private message.

187
00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:16,172
[SPEAKER_15]: And the first two people who got it right get to participate tonight.

188
00:13:16,252 --> 00:13:20,735
[SPEAKER_15]: So, in the meantime, while we wait for those answers to come in, what do we want to talk about?

189
00:13:20,975 --> 00:13:23,516
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh yes, let's talk about the contest.

190
00:13:23,697 --> 00:13:23,937
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

191
00:13:24,177 --> 00:13:26,378
[SPEAKER_15]: First of all, what inspired the pre-show that we did tonight?

192
00:13:26,698 --> 00:13:27,399
[SPEAKER_02]: I ran out of ideas.

193
00:13:29,276 --> 00:13:33,339
[SPEAKER_15]: So, for those that just joined us and missed the pre-show, tell us what we did tonight.

194
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:35,321
[SPEAKER_02]: Old TV show theme songs.

195
00:13:35,821 --> 00:13:36,962
[SPEAKER_15]: Old TV show theme songs.

196
00:13:37,062 --> 00:13:39,724
[SPEAKER_02]: Many of which were donated by DDR Angel and Stresa.

197
00:13:39,844 --> 00:13:41,206
[SPEAKER_15]: Next week you should play Eurobeat.

198
00:13:41,786 --> 00:13:42,567
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I will.

199
00:13:42,907 --> 00:13:43,688
[SPEAKER_12]: Eurobeat.

200
00:13:44,468 --> 00:13:44,648
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh!

201
00:13:44,688 --> 00:13:45,209
[SPEAKER_12]: Beat, beat.

202
00:13:45,649 --> 00:13:46,710
[SPEAKER_02]: Not the song.

203
00:13:46,970 --> 00:13:48,511
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll just play the whole Parapara soundtrack.

204
00:13:48,531 --> 00:13:49,012
[SPEAKER_02]: How's that sound?

205
00:13:49,032 --> 00:13:54,836
[SPEAKER_02]: Like all music from Initial D. Okay, I lost all 17 of my Initial D soundtracks.

206
00:13:54,896 --> 00:13:57,278
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, next time Jamie takes a week off, you can do pre-show.

207
00:13:57,739 --> 00:13:58,199
[SPEAKER_15]: How's that, Matt?

208
00:13:59,147 --> 00:14:00,150
[SPEAKER_02]: Am I going to take a week off?

209
00:14:01,072 --> 00:14:03,699
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

210
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:05,504
[SPEAKER_02]: No, next week's pre-show is Strong Bad Things.

211
00:14:07,589 --> 00:14:09,511
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, so let me think.

212
00:14:10,291 --> 00:14:10,552
[SPEAKER_15]: What else?

213
00:14:10,612 --> 00:14:11,653
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh yes, the contest.

214
00:14:11,893 --> 00:14:13,154
[SPEAKER_15]: So, great idea.

215
00:14:13,214 --> 00:14:16,417
[SPEAKER_15]: We have to give thanks to Dark Tetsuya for this idea.

216
00:14:16,457 --> 00:14:17,258
[SPEAKER_15]: This is a great idea.

217
00:14:18,359 --> 00:14:21,842
[SPEAKER_15]: Orange Lounge Radio is going to be hosting our own DWI contest.

218
00:14:21,882 --> 00:14:23,503
[SPEAKER_15]: Because we're going to do this right, goddammit.

219
00:14:23,523 --> 00:14:25,705
[SPEAKER_15]: We're going to do a DWI contest and it's going to kick ass.

220
00:14:26,806 --> 00:14:33,352
[SPEAKER_15]: And the theme is, you have to do a DWI complete with backgrounds, basic trick and maniac steps,

221
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:39,883
[SPEAKER_15]: and banners, the whole nine yards, to any old TV theme.

222
00:14:39,963 --> 00:14:42,344
[SPEAKER_15]: Or actually, no, any TV theme you want to do.

223
00:14:42,805 --> 00:14:43,745
[SPEAKER_15]: Two minutes at the most.

224
00:14:43,965 --> 00:14:45,586
[SPEAKER_15]: If it's longer than two minutes, you better crop it down.

225
00:14:46,247 --> 00:14:47,247
[SPEAKER_15]: Any TV theme.

226
00:14:47,427 --> 00:14:49,568
[SPEAKER_15]: You want to do a DWI too, send that in.

227
00:14:49,989 --> 00:14:53,050
[SPEAKER_15]: And the winner's going to get, can we get a prize pack for the winner, Loki, you think?

228
00:14:53,871 --> 00:14:54,411
[SPEAKER_15]: Sure.

229
00:14:54,471 --> 00:14:55,312
[SPEAKER_15]: Just a small one, maybe?

230
00:14:55,532 --> 00:14:56,212
[SPEAKER_15]: Something small, yeah.

231
00:14:56,472 --> 00:14:59,274
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, so we're going to get a prize pack, one of Loki's infamous prize packs for the winner.

232
00:15:00,908 --> 00:15:02,989
[SPEAKER_15]: In case somebody is like, small, uh?

233
00:15:03,349 --> 00:15:06,750
[SPEAKER_15]: When Matt says small, it's really not small as you think.

234
00:15:07,530 --> 00:15:08,370
[SPEAKER_15]: Let me see, wait, let me see.

235
00:15:08,530 --> 00:15:10,931
[SPEAKER_15]: We've got EvilNauki2DX in the chatroom.

236
00:15:10,951 --> 00:15:11,271
[SPEAKER_15]: Let me see.

237
00:15:11,591 --> 00:15:15,273
[SPEAKER_15]: Would Calibimani.com be willing to host this contest with us?

238
00:15:15,553 --> 00:15:19,254
[SPEAKER_15]: So we can get some place to have the files and some more promotion here.

239
00:15:19,614 --> 00:15:20,754
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, you've got your site too.

240
00:15:21,014 --> 00:15:22,335
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, okay, you're going to host RDDOS?

241
00:15:23,795 --> 00:15:24,735
[SPEAKER_15]: I still want more promotion.

242
00:15:24,775 --> 00:15:27,076
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's see if we can get Kali Bamani to go in on this with us.

243
00:15:27,556 --> 00:15:28,536
[SPEAKER_15]: A joint contest here.

244
00:15:29,557 --> 00:15:30,017
[SPEAKER_15]: More promotion.

245
00:15:30,057 --> 00:15:33,078
[SPEAKER_15]: But you will host all the DWI files on the new Leech from Loki site.

246
00:15:33,098 --> 00:15:35,058
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, my new Leech from Loki site.

247
00:15:35,658 --> 00:15:36,759
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh yeah, I need to finish that.

248
00:15:38,159 --> 00:15:39,679
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, I get a yes.

249
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:40,820
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, so this is it.

250
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:44,181
[SPEAKER_15]: The KaliBamani.com slash Orange Launch Radio DWI contest.

251
00:15:44,301 --> 00:15:45,941
[SPEAKER_15]: Must be TV theme song.

252
00:15:46,661 --> 00:15:47,141
[SPEAKER_15]: Deadline.

253
00:15:47,262 --> 00:15:48,222
[SPEAKER_15]: When do we want them done by?

254
00:15:48,702 --> 00:15:48,822
[SPEAKER_17]: Uh...

255
00:15:50,467 --> 00:15:55,331
[SPEAKER_17]: We need a tentative deadline right now so we can iron out all the rules and shit.

256
00:15:55,991 --> 00:16:00,795
[SPEAKER_17]: You need to iron out what the rules and stuff would be.

257
00:16:00,975 --> 00:16:06,960
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, so we'll just tell everybody they're going to have to look on the forums for the information.

258
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:08,902
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, American, Canadian, or British.

259
00:16:09,882 --> 00:16:10,123
[SPEAKER_15]: So...

260
00:16:11,724 --> 00:16:12,444
[SPEAKER_15]: This is the deal.

261
00:16:12,904 --> 00:16:15,185
[SPEAKER_15]: We don't know how we want to submit these yet, but that's okay.

262
00:16:15,245 --> 00:16:18,406
[SPEAKER_15]: Just go work on them, and we'll have more details for you next week.

263
00:16:18,966 --> 00:16:24,187
[SPEAKER_15]: Next week's show, by the way, Jamie's going to be here, and Loki, you're going to be here too, yes, next week?

264
00:16:24,547 --> 00:16:24,967
[SPEAKER_15]: I will not.

265
00:16:25,267 --> 00:16:25,507
[SPEAKER_13]: I will.

266
00:16:25,687 --> 00:16:27,088
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm going to be in L.A.

267
00:16:27,148 --> 00:16:28,108
[SPEAKER_15]: at the Cyber Beat Tournament.

268
00:16:29,568 --> 00:16:30,368
[SPEAKER_17]: I'll set it all up.

269
00:16:30,889 --> 00:16:33,309
[SPEAKER_17]: I've already got a way where they can send the files to me.

270
00:16:33,649 --> 00:16:33,809
[SPEAKER_15]: Great.

271
00:16:34,189 --> 00:16:36,550
[SPEAKER_15]: So we'll set something up, and we'll have more information for you next week.

272
00:16:37,535 --> 00:16:42,439
[SPEAKER_12]: And if anyone still remembers leachfromloki.tk, do not go there.

273
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:47,462
[SPEAKER_12]: Because that is the most disturbing picture I've ever seen in my entire life.

274
00:16:48,123 --> 00:16:49,303
[SPEAKER_12]: Whatever, blah blah blah.

275
00:16:49,323 --> 00:16:50,724
[SPEAKER_15]: That was funny though.

276
00:16:50,864 --> 00:16:51,325
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, whatever.

277
00:16:51,665 --> 00:16:59,030
[SPEAKER_15]: Anyway, but the correct address for Loki's site is www.willddrforfood.net slash leachfromloki.

278
00:17:00,391 --> 00:17:01,392
[SPEAKER_15]: So, anyway.

279
00:17:02,253 --> 00:17:04,174
[SPEAKER_15]: So now you know, we're doing a DWI contest.

280
00:17:04,214 --> 00:17:06,956
[SPEAKER_15]: And the judges will be, of course, myself, Jamie, and Loki.

281
00:17:09,247 --> 00:17:11,329
[SPEAKER_15]: That's because we're cool.

282
00:17:11,369 --> 00:17:13,330
[SPEAKER_02]: We're cooler than everybody in the world!

283
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:27,562
[SPEAKER_17]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

284
00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:55,720
[SPEAKER_15]: Halleck

285
00:18:22,099 --> 00:18:24,080
[SPEAKER_15]: Hollick is Jamie's favorite tax song.

286
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:26,241
[SPEAKER_15]: Congratulations to Black Lab and USFBB.

287
00:18:26,261 --> 00:18:28,002
[SPEAKER_15]: They are our contestants tonight.

288
00:18:28,682 --> 00:18:29,022
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright.

289
00:18:29,463 --> 00:18:31,123
[SPEAKER_02]: And by the way, my second favorite is DXY.

290
00:18:31,764 --> 00:18:32,904
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, close though.

291
00:18:33,705 --> 00:18:35,666
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright, everybody that sends us some good stuff.

292
00:18:35,706 --> 00:18:37,246
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright, so, here we go.

293
00:18:37,366 --> 00:18:39,668
[SPEAKER_15]: Our two contestants for tonight's episode of the Match Game.

294
00:18:39,688 --> 00:18:41,488
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's introduce the celebrities.

295
00:18:43,630 --> 00:18:44,070
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi.

296
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:45,891
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, Dad.

297
00:18:45,951 --> 00:18:46,611
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm in jail.

298
00:18:47,171 --> 00:18:48,252
[SPEAKER_15]: Celebrity number one.

299
00:18:48,272 --> 00:18:48,572
[SPEAKER_02]: I like it here.

300
00:18:49,306 --> 00:18:58,195
[SPEAKER_15]: Celebrity number one is, uh, you know her because she's on this really popular internet radio talk show, and she bitches a lot about things.

301
00:19:00,377 --> 00:19:02,859
[SPEAKER_15]: Say hello to celebrity number one, Miss DarkSakura.

302
00:19:04,521 --> 00:19:09,285
[SPEAKER_15]: Celebrity number two is a DWI horse, and he's a whore for porn.

303
00:19:10,467 --> 00:19:11,548
[SPEAKER_15]: Or so everybody thinks.

304
00:19:12,388 --> 00:19:13,790
[SPEAKER_02]: And he likes to beat his wild pony.

305
00:19:15,456 --> 00:19:17,399
[SPEAKER_15]: Say hello to Loki, celebrity number two.

306
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:19,281
[SPEAKER_15]: He loves you, baby.

307
00:19:19,982 --> 00:19:21,584
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright, celebrity number three.

308
00:19:22,385 --> 00:19:26,130
[SPEAKER_15]: If you thought I was gay, you have to meet celebrity number three.

309
00:19:26,571 --> 00:19:27,492
[SPEAKER_15]: Say hello to Billy.

310
00:19:28,093 --> 00:19:28,674
[SPEAKER_15]: Hello to Billy.

311
00:19:30,706 --> 00:19:34,589
[SPEAKER_15]: Celebrity number four is another familiar face from around the Sackbomani community.

312
00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:37,912
[SPEAKER_15]: He's just cool, and he wears a hat that says hookups.

313
00:19:38,773 --> 00:19:41,635
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know if he's like trying to mack and get some hookups.

314
00:19:41,875 --> 00:19:42,936
[SPEAKER_15]: Are you trying to get hookups?

315
00:19:43,076 --> 00:19:45,498
[SPEAKER_15]: It's like clothing.

316
00:19:46,099 --> 00:19:46,659
[SPEAKER_04]: It's clothing?

317
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:47,760
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

318
00:19:48,441 --> 00:19:49,742
[SPEAKER_15]: Celebrity number four is zero.

319
00:19:49,842 --> 00:19:50,122
[SPEAKER_15]: Give it up.

320
00:19:50,282 --> 00:19:50,863
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, how's it going?

321
00:19:51,083 --> 00:19:51,343
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

322
00:19:51,623 --> 00:19:53,285
[SPEAKER_15]: Celebrity number... Are you participating?

323
00:19:53,345 --> 00:19:53,465
[SPEAKER_15]: No.

324
00:19:53,505 --> 00:19:53,705
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

325
00:19:53,785 --> 00:19:54,706
[SPEAKER_15]: And celebrity number five...

326
00:19:56,932 --> 00:19:58,633
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, we have a team.

327
00:19:58,673 --> 00:20:00,135
[SPEAKER_15]: We have a tag team for Celebrity 5.

328
00:20:04,459 --> 00:20:04,899
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, yes.

329
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:08,443
[SPEAKER_15]: Is Brad and Dave.

330
00:20:08,763 --> 00:20:09,364
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, whatever.

331
00:20:10,825 --> 00:20:14,108
[SPEAKER_15]: And then Celebrity number 6 is the coolest person in the entire world.

332
00:20:14,148 --> 00:20:14,529
[SPEAKER_15]: That's me.

333
00:20:15,785 --> 00:20:17,026
[SPEAKER_15]: Fuck no!

334
00:20:17,867 --> 00:20:19,609
[SPEAKER_15]: All right, so six celebrities tonight.

335
00:20:19,950 --> 00:20:20,891
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's play a match game.

336
00:20:20,911 --> 00:20:24,695
[SPEAKER_15]: If you don't know how we play a Vamani match game, I'm going to ask a question.

337
00:20:24,855 --> 00:20:25,416
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're going to burp.

338
00:20:25,516 --> 00:20:26,577
[SPEAKER_15]: And there'll be a blanket.

339
00:20:27,118 --> 00:20:33,966
[SPEAKER_15]: And the contestants tonight, Black Lab and the OSFBB, will have to try to fill in that blanket.

340
00:20:34,146 --> 00:20:36,208
[SPEAKER_15]: And for every celebrity they match, they get a point.

341
00:20:36,268 --> 00:20:36,709
[SPEAKER_18]: Blanket.

342
00:20:37,665 --> 00:20:38,146
[SPEAKER_15]: Wonderful.

343
00:20:39,367 --> 00:20:41,470
[SPEAKER_15]: A few things you should know about the celebrities.

344
00:20:41,630 --> 00:20:47,497
[SPEAKER_15]: You already know myself, Jamie, and Loki pretty well if you listen to the show on a regular basis, which I know both Black Lab and EOSA TV do.

345
00:20:47,517 --> 00:20:47,637
[SPEAKER_15]: Billy?

346
00:20:49,514 --> 00:20:54,456
[SPEAKER_15]: Billy's played DDR a couple times, but he doesn't get it, this whole obsession.

347
00:20:55,236 --> 00:20:59,798
[SPEAKER_15]: But he's a big fag, so... And he loves Britney.

348
00:20:59,838 --> 00:21:02,839
[SPEAKER_18]: But wait, he doesn't live in the main hall of Rosen Village.

349
00:21:03,899 --> 00:21:09,761
[SPEAKER_17]: If anybody can guess his favorite DDR song, they get... nothing, but yes.

350
00:21:10,341 --> 00:21:11,722
[SPEAKER_15]: Zero, I don't know.

351
00:21:11,802 --> 00:21:13,242
[SPEAKER_15]: Zero's kind of a wild card.

352
00:21:13,282 --> 00:21:14,803
[SPEAKER_15]: What will your answers be like, Zero?

353
00:21:15,939 --> 00:21:17,720
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know, they'll just be whatever they look like.

354
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:19,820
[SPEAKER_15]: They'll be the right ones, okay.

355
00:21:21,641 --> 00:21:25,662
[SPEAKER_15]: And then Brad and Dave are both very crazy, so their answers will be crazy.

356
00:21:27,363 --> 00:21:28,703
[SPEAKER_15]: They're crazy people!

357
00:21:30,704 --> 00:21:32,544
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright, first question.

358
00:21:34,265 --> 00:21:36,626
[SPEAKER_15]: We haven't done this in a while, so here we go.

359
00:21:37,146 --> 00:21:37,726
[SPEAKER_15]: First question!

360
00:21:38,815 --> 00:21:40,356
[SPEAKER_15]: Ted the Terrorizer.

361
00:21:40,856 --> 00:21:43,258
[SPEAKER_15]: Love to make fun of people that play DDR.

362
00:21:43,278 --> 00:21:44,159
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to spell Terrorizer.

363
00:21:44,579 --> 00:21:44,839
Shh.

364
00:21:45,539 --> 00:21:46,140
[SPEAKER_15]: They don't know that.

365
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:46,680
[SPEAKER_15]: It's radio.

366
00:21:47,421 --> 00:21:47,861
[SPEAKER_15]: Here, look.

367
00:21:47,901 --> 00:21:49,782
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll right click and do spell check right now.

368
00:21:49,822 --> 00:21:51,023
[SPEAKER_06]: Here we go.

369
00:21:51,303 --> 00:21:52,104
[SPEAKER_15]: Terrorized.

370
00:21:52,364 --> 00:21:53,785
[SPEAKER_15]: Ted the Terrorizer.

371
00:21:54,225 --> 00:21:54,525
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

372
00:21:54,986 --> 00:21:55,886
[SPEAKER_15]: Ted the Terrorizer.

373
00:21:56,206 --> 00:21:56,547
[SPEAKER_15]: Damn it.

374
00:21:56,767 --> 00:21:57,267
[SPEAKER_15]: It doesn't matter.

375
00:21:59,168 --> 00:21:59,929
[SPEAKER_15]: Can I ask a question?

376
00:22:00,530 --> 00:22:03,612
[SPEAKER_15]: Ted the Terrorizer loved to make fun of people that played DDR.

377
00:22:04,233 --> 00:22:10,499
[SPEAKER_15]: He liked to yell to the goofy people stomping on the game, Hey, stop stomping on the arrows and go blank!

378
00:22:13,988 --> 00:22:14,248
Oh, hi!

379
00:22:14,268 --> 00:22:14,649
How about you?

380
00:22:14,669 --> 00:22:16,190
The answer should be in here.

381
00:22:16,230 --> 00:22:17,190
Just pick something.

382
00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:40,131
[SPEAKER_15]: Don't say it, write it down.

383
00:22:40,731 --> 00:22:41,791
[SPEAKER_15]: What's the first thing that comes to mind?

384
00:22:41,811 --> 00:22:42,292
[SPEAKER_15]: Write it down.

385
00:22:42,792 --> 00:22:44,192
[SPEAKER_15]: Stop stomping on the arrows and go blank.

386
00:22:50,594 --> 00:22:51,814
[SPEAKER_15]: Are all the other celebrities locked in?

387
00:22:52,735 --> 00:22:53,235
[SPEAKER_05]: Ding!

388
00:22:55,267 --> 00:22:56,107
[SPEAKER_15]: Is that your final answer?

389
00:22:57,108 --> 00:22:57,788
[SPEAKER_15]: Billy, you got one?

390
00:22:58,429 --> 00:22:59,609
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, do you guys have one?

391
00:23:00,050 --> 00:23:01,070
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright, great, we're ready.

392
00:23:01,851 --> 00:23:04,132
[SPEAKER_15]: I have both the contestants locked in too.

393
00:23:05,072 --> 00:23:06,553
[SPEAKER_15]: And I had Stressa send me something.

394
00:23:06,573 --> 00:23:07,394
[SPEAKER_15]: Did he send me an answer?

395
00:23:07,934 --> 00:23:09,535
[SPEAKER_15]: Stressa, you're not a contestant, I'm sorry.

396
00:23:10,475 --> 00:23:11,336
[SPEAKER_15]: Although that was a good answer.

397
00:23:11,696 --> 00:23:12,537
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, let's see, here we go.

398
00:23:13,357 --> 00:23:19,661
[SPEAKER_15]: Black Lab said, Stop stomping on the arrows and go get laid.

399
00:23:22,149 --> 00:23:22,489
[SPEAKER_18]: Lovely.

00:23:22,909 --> 00:23:23,450
[SPEAKER_15]: Lovely.

401
00:23:24,010 --> 00:23:28,513
[SPEAKER_15]: EOSFBB said, Stop stomping on the arrows and go watch porn.

402
00:23:29,934 --> 00:23:30,495
[SPEAKER_15]: Good answers.

403
00:23:30,535 --> 00:23:31,015
[SPEAKER_15]: Good answers.

404
00:23:31,075 --> 00:23:31,375
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

405
00:23:31,916 --> 00:23:32,797
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's see if we get a match.

406
00:23:32,857 --> 00:23:38,481
[SPEAKER_15]: Jamie, Ted the Terrorizer said, Stop stomping on the arrows and go... Fuck me in the ass.

407
00:23:39,421 --> 00:23:39,782
[SPEAKER_00]: Bard girl.

[SPEAKER_15]: No, it's not a match, I'm sorry.

00:23:56,339 --> 00:23:56,839
[SPEAKER_15]: Loki.

00:23:58,020 --> 00:24:09,065
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, go... Okay, she had my answer, so, um... Let's see, uh... Go eat baby fetus.

415
00:24:11,605 --> 00:24:14,267
[SPEAKER_15]: Go eat baby fetus, I'm sorry, that's not a match.

416
00:24:14,287 --> 00:24:16,088
[SPEAKER_02]: You mean that the baby itself is pregnant and has a fetus?

417
00:24:17,809 --> 00:24:19,550
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, well, there's... yeah, whatever.

418
00:24:19,730 --> 00:24:22,031
[SPEAKER_17]: I had fuck me in the ass, but, yeah, alright.

00:24:22,652 --> 00:24:23,052
[SPEAKER_15]: Billy!

420
00:24:23,872 --> 00:24:25,994

[SPEAKER_15]: Stop stomping on the arrows and go homo.

422
00:24:32,838 --> 00:24:33,918
[SPEAKER_15]: No, I'm sorry, that's not a match.

423
00:24:34,419 --> 00:24:36,080

[SPEAKER_08]: and GoFuckYourself.

[SPEAKER_15]: And GoFuckYourself.

426
00:24:39,670 --> 00:24:40,571
[SPEAKER_15]: That's the obvious one.

427
00:24:40,611 --> 00:24:41,312
[SPEAKER_15]: Nobody guessed that.

428
00:24:42,152 --> 00:24:42,473
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

429
00:24:43,153 --> 00:24:45,776
[SPEAKER_15]: Stop stomping on the arrows and go... Fuck a sheep.

430
00:24:46,817 --> 00:24:47,477
[SPEAKER_15]: Or your sister.

431
00:24:47,938 --> 00:24:48,578
[SPEAKER_15]: Or yourself.

432
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:52,201
[SPEAKER_15]: You brain-dead redneck asshole.

433
00:24:52,422 --> 00:24:52,942
[SPEAKER_15]: There you go.

434
00:24:53,342 --> 00:24:58,887
[SPEAKER_15]: Stop stomping on the arrows and go fuck a sheep, your sister, or yourself, you brain-dead redneck asshole.

435
00:24:58,927 --> 00:24:59,388
[SPEAKER_15]: No, I'm sorry.

436
00:24:59,408 --> 00:25:00,088
[SPEAKER_15]: That was not a match.

437
00:25:00,349 --> 00:25:00,969
[SPEAKER_15]: But it was funny.

438
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:02,851
[SPEAKER_15]: My answer...

439
00:25:06,488 --> 00:25:10,680
[SPEAKER_15]: My answer, hey, stop stomping on the arrows and go shove a bottle of Propel up your ass.

440
00:25:16,486 --> 00:25:17,627
[SPEAKER_15]: That's a very good observation, Brad.

441
00:25:17,647 --> 00:25:19,428
[SPEAKER_15]: They all have to do with penetration of some sort.

442
00:25:19,448 --> 00:25:21,530
[SPEAKER_18]: Not necessarily.

443
00:25:22,330 --> 00:25:23,511
[SPEAKER_15]: Billy's is implied, though.

444
00:25:24,552 --> 00:25:26,714
[SPEAKER_02]: Just because you're gay, you don't have to fuck me.

445
00:25:26,734 --> 00:25:27,555
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's right.

446
00:25:27,575 --> 00:25:30,777
[SPEAKER_15]: Just because you're gay doesn't mean you have to fuck people in the ass.

447
00:25:30,797 --> 00:25:32,939
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think that you can be gay and not a slut.

448
00:25:38,604 --> 00:25:38,884
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright.

449
00:25:39,364 --> 00:25:40,025
[SPEAKER_00]: You're a party.

450
00:25:41,706 --> 00:25:42,467
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright, so...

451
00:25:43,593 --> 00:25:45,837
[SPEAKER_15]: So sorry kids, no points.

452
00:25:45,957 --> 00:25:48,141
[SPEAKER_15]: The score is all tied up with a big fat zero.

453
00:25:48,201 --> 00:25:48,902
[SPEAKER_15]: Next question.

454
00:25:49,203 --> 00:25:50,485

[SPEAKER_15]: He gasped in horror one day, though, when SyFam didn't send him the album he had ordered.

459
00:26:22,466 --> 00:26:24,972
[SPEAKER_15]: Instead, they had sent him a CD of blank.

460
00:26:28,436 --> 00:26:32,558
[SPEAKER_15]: JB the Jenny Romhor loved to order things from Jenny's record company.

[SPEAKER_15]: He gasped in horror one day, though, when he didn't get the album he had ordered.

462
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:38,441
[SPEAKER_15]: Instead, they had sent him a CD of blank.

00:26:57,102 --> 00:26:58,566
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm waiting for both contestants.

464
00:26:58,667 --> 00:26:58,987
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

465
00:27:00,091 --> 00:27:03,360
[SPEAKER_15]: JB gasped into horror when he did not get the album he had ordered.

[SPEAKER_02]: Schoolgirl?

575
00:33:22,353 --> 00:33:24,075

[SPEAKER_15]: First, EOSFVB.

581
00:33:32,939 --> 00:33:34,280
[SPEAKER_15]: EOSFVB goes first this time.

582
00:33:34,781 --> 00:33:37,623
[SPEAKER_15]: Dear Propel, you really need to make ass flavor.

583
00:33:39,664 --> 00:33:40,305
[SPEAKER_15]: Ass flavor.

584
00:33:40,385 --> 00:33:40,845
[SPEAKER_15]: Beautiful.

585
00:33:41,446 --> 00:33:45,649
[SPEAKER_15]: BlackLat says, Dear Propel, you really need to make tack flavor.

586
00:33:46,870 --> 00:33:47,851
[SPEAKER_15]: Ah, very good.

587
00:33:47,891 --> 00:33:48,531
[SPEAKER_15]: Tack flavor.

588
00:33:48,571 --> 00:33:49,012
[SPEAKER_15]: Good answer.

589
00:33:49,552 --> 00:33:51,934
[SPEAKER_15]: Also matched with Angel and Dark Tetsuya.

590
00:33:52,454 --> 00:33:54,276
[SPEAKER_15]: Both said that in the chatroom at different points.

591
00:33:54,316 --> 00:33:55,196
[SPEAKER_15]: But you don't get a point for them.

592
00:33:56,837 --> 00:33:59,058
[SPEAKER_15]: and Ohio Bomani makes a good point.

593
00:33:59,398 --> 00:34:00,899
[SPEAKER_15]: Lemon-flavored is ass-flavored.

594
00:34:02,179 --> 00:34:04,060
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

595
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:04,660
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

596
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:05,020
[SPEAKER_02]: Here we go.

597
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:05,300
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.

598
00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:06,441
[SPEAKER_15]: So, Jamie, you are going to go first.

599
00:34:06,761 --> 00:34:08,902
[SPEAKER_15]: And this would be the correct answer, hypothetically.

600
00:34:10,362 --> 00:34:14,704
[SPEAKER_02]: As much as I enjoy the thought of tax-flavored Pocari Sweat, my answer is Pocari Sweat.

601
00:34:15,444 --> 00:34:16,985
[SPEAKER_15]: Ah, Pocari Sweat-flavored.

602
00:34:17,065 --> 00:34:17,545
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

603
00:34:17,785 --> 00:34:18,405
[SPEAKER_15]: Good, good.

604
00:34:18,685 --> 00:34:22,527
[SPEAKER_02]: Which, you know, is actually going to be mentioned in my puppy of the week later on.

605
00:34:22,607 --> 00:34:23,567
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, okay.

606
00:34:24,107 --> 00:34:24,828
[SPEAKER_15]: All right, moving on.

607
00:34:25,008 --> 00:34:25,328
[SPEAKER_15]: Loki.

608
00:34:27,013 --> 00:34:34,957
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, see, I had Blood of a Virgin on there as a flavor, but I'm just going to go with Vanilla Coke flavor.

609
00:34:35,397 --> 00:34:40,499
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry, Blood of a Virgin wouldn't be good because I don't want to do that next time.

610
00:34:40,859 --> 00:34:45,481
[SPEAKER_15]: All right, so we had Vanilla Coke flavor.

611
00:34:45,521 --> 00:34:46,562
[SPEAKER_15]: Not a bad answer, not a bad answer.

612
00:34:47,042 --> 00:34:47,562
[SPEAKER_15]: All right, Billy.

613
00:34:48,022 --> 00:34:49,603
[SPEAKER_15]: Cream of some young guy.

614
00:34:49,623 --> 00:34:51,264
[SPEAKER_15]: Cream of some young guy flavor.

615
00:34:52,284 --> 00:34:53,785
[SPEAKER_15]: Good answer, but not a match, sorry.

616
00:34:54,506 --> 00:34:54,886
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright.

617
00:34:55,607 --> 00:34:56,127
[SPEAKER_15]: Zero.

618
00:34:56,327 --> 00:34:57,728
[SPEAKER_12]: Sadly enough, I did write ass.

619
00:35:00,470 --> 00:35:00,711
[SPEAKER_12]: Wait.

620
00:35:01,291 --> 00:35:05,494
[SPEAKER_12]: Wait, did Billy say some young guy or some... Oh, I thought it was like some young guy.

621
00:35:05,815 --> 00:35:07,796
[SPEAKER_12]: It's like, is that some Japanese food or something?

622
00:35:09,197 --> 00:35:11,499
[SPEAKER_12]: No, I just... No, I have seen it.

623
00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:13,641
[SPEAKER_12]: I just... I didn't comprehend it.

624
00:35:13,661 --> 00:35:13,941
[SPEAKER_12]: Answer!

625
00:35:14,521 --> 00:35:14,762
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

626
00:35:16,058 --> 00:35:17,019
[SPEAKER_12]: I want to say what?

627
00:35:17,079 --> 00:35:17,819
[SPEAKER_12]: I want to say what?

628
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:19,100
[SPEAKER_18]: I speak just as well.

629
00:35:19,140 --> 00:35:20,381
[SPEAKER_12]: What?

630
00:35:20,441 --> 00:35:21,061
[SPEAKER_12]: What?

631
00:35:21,181 --> 00:35:22,202
[SPEAKER_02]: I speak just as well.

632
00:35:23,183 --> 00:35:23,623
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

633
00:35:24,163 --> 00:35:24,884
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

634
00:35:25,564 --> 00:35:27,365
[SPEAKER_12]: Ours was okra flavored.

635
00:35:29,727 --> 00:35:30,087
[SPEAKER_02]: Mmm.

636
00:35:30,767 --> 00:35:31,248
[SPEAKER_02]: Okra.

637
00:35:31,648 --> 00:35:33,189
[SPEAKER_02]: Like gumbo.

638
00:35:33,389 --> 00:35:33,709
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

639
00:35:34,310 --> 00:35:40,173
[SPEAKER_15]: And my answer, because I guess that Jamie ate a lot of it when she was younger and maybe she wanted to relive her youth, I put paste flavored.

640
00:35:41,034 --> 00:35:42,235
[SPEAKER_02]: I never ate paste flavored.

641
00:35:43,872 --> 00:35:48,194
[SPEAKER_02]: Although, what I would do is I would take school glue and pour it on my hand.

642
00:35:48,895 --> 00:35:52,097
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when it dries, it dries clear.

643
00:35:52,557 --> 00:35:54,258
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I would go up to people and peel it back.

644
00:35:54,318 --> 00:35:55,278
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my god, my skin!

645
00:35:55,639 --> 00:35:55,799
Ah!

646
00:35:56,319 --> 00:35:59,341
Okay.

647
00:35:59,561 --> 00:36:00,141
[SPEAKER_15]: Or paper.

648
00:36:00,221 --> 00:36:00,541
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright.

649
00:36:04,443 --> 00:36:05,985
[SPEAKER_15]: So, we had a point.

650
00:36:06,065 --> 00:36:07,205
[SPEAKER_15]: We did get finally one point.

651
00:36:07,606 --> 00:36:09,787
[SPEAKER_15]: So, EOSFBB takes the lead by one point.

652
00:36:10,167 --> 00:36:10,488
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright.

653
00:36:12,629 --> 00:36:13,070
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

654
00:36:14,250 --> 00:36:16,352
[SPEAKER_15]: It's not about being right, it's about being funny.

655
00:36:16,532 --> 00:36:18,994
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

656
00:36:20,255 --> 00:36:20,935
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright, here we go.

657
00:36:21,535 --> 00:36:22,076
[SPEAKER_15]: Next question.

658
00:36:22,116 --> 00:36:22,596
[SPEAKER_15]: Two more left.

659
00:36:22,616 --> 00:36:23,577
[SPEAKER_15]: We've got a five question game.

660
00:36:24,658 --> 00:36:30,562
[SPEAKER_15]: Billy the Big Homosexual loved to play gay Bomani songs.

661
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:56,799
[SPEAKER_15]: He really wished that they would put blank into DDR Billy the Big Homosexual loved to play Gabe Imani songs He really wished that they would put blank into DDR I have mine Just fill in the blank with whatever you want

662
00:36:57,771 --> 00:37:00,753
[SPEAKER_15]: Billy the Big Homosexual loved to play Gabe Imani songs.

663
00:37:00,813 --> 00:37:02,974
[SPEAKER_15]: He really wished they would put blank in the DDR.

664
00:37:06,656 --> 00:37:07,016
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm kidding.

665
00:37:08,837 --> 00:37:09,898
[SPEAKER_15]: I didn't say it was you.

666
00:37:10,358 --> 00:37:11,359
[SPEAKER_15]: How many people are named Billy?

667
00:37:11,379 --> 00:37:13,060
[SPEAKER_15]: Are you insinuating something?

668
00:37:15,981 --> 00:37:16,842
[SPEAKER_15]: Is everybody locked in?

669
00:37:18,022 --> 00:37:19,103
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, is Billy locked in?

670
00:37:21,772 --> 00:37:23,033
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, answer.

671
00:37:23,553 --> 00:37:25,113
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, both our contestants are locked in.

672
00:37:25,133 --> 00:37:25,513
[SPEAKER_15]: Here we go.

673
00:37:25,873 --> 00:37:26,693
[SPEAKER_18]: Are you guys locked in?

674
00:37:26,733 --> 00:37:27,273

[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.

00:37:29,794 --> 00:37:30,234
[SPEAKER_15]: Here we go.

677
00:37:30,774 --> 00:37:31,294
[SPEAKER_02]: What's that name?

678
00:37:31,334 --> 00:37:31,954
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Robin.

679
00:37:32,275 --> 00:37:38,236
[SPEAKER_15]: Black Lab says, I really wish that they would put some lamb into DDR.

680
00:37:41,336 --> 00:37:41,857
[SPEAKER_15]: Lamb.

681
00:37:41,877 --> 00:37:43,057
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, good answer, but no.

682
00:37:44,811 --> 00:37:45,191
[SPEAKER_15]: We'll see.

683
00:37:45,511 --> 00:37:45,651
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh!

684
00:37:47,152 --> 00:37:52,614
[SPEAKER_15]: The OSFBB says, I really wish that they would put some bars that rape you back into DDR.

685
00:37:56,615 --> 00:37:57,356
[SPEAKER_15]: That's a good one.

686
00:37:57,976 --> 00:37:59,517
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright, let's see if there's any matches.

687
00:38:00,017 --> 00:38:00,397
[SPEAKER_15]: Jamie.

688
00:38:01,269 --> 00:38:04,030
[SPEAKER_15]: Billy really wishes that they would put... Back That Ass Up.

689
00:38:04,210 --> 00:38:06,031
[SPEAKER_15]: Back That Ass Up in the DDR.

690
00:38:06,151 --> 00:38:07,372
[SPEAKER_15]: No, not a match, but a good answer.

691
00:38:07,952 --> 00:38:08,272
[SPEAKER_15]: Loki.

692
00:38:08,793 --> 00:38:10,413
[SPEAKER_17]: From last week, Temple of Butt.

693
00:38:10,593 --> 00:38:11,554
[SPEAKER_15]: Temple of Butt!

694
00:38:13,455 --> 00:38:14,195
[SPEAKER_15]: Billy's all, ooh!

695
00:38:16,476 --> 00:38:19,878
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, Billy, now this would be the correct answer, supposedly, in a perfect world.

696
00:38:20,058 --> 00:38:21,178
[SPEAKER_15]: Billy, what should they do?

697
00:38:21,198 --> 00:38:22,479
[SPEAKER_15]: Insert any Kylie song here.

698
00:38:24,415 --> 00:38:27,416
[SPEAKER_15]: If you knew Billie, you knew just go with Kylie Minogue.

699
00:38:27,436 --> 00:38:28,016
[SPEAKER_15]: That's all you had to do.

700
00:38:28,056 --> 00:38:28,977
[SPEAKER_15]: Now, this is the funny thing.

701
00:38:29,457 --> 00:38:33,719
[SPEAKER_15]: Kylie Minogue shows up on all those Dance Mania albums, but they have not put her in DDR yet.

702
00:38:35,319 --> 00:38:35,539
[SPEAKER_15]: What?

703
00:38:36,820 --> 00:38:45,143
[SPEAKER_15]: Dancing States Party Edition, remember, had... The British version, the British home version, had Can't Get You Out of My Head On It.

704
00:38:48,316 --> 00:38:50,158
[SPEAKER_15]: Billy Says, which goes to show it's America's Awesome.

705
00:38:50,498 --> 00:38:50,818
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

706
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:52,640
[SPEAKER_15]: Zero.

707
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:57,305
[SPEAKER_15]: I really wish they'd put Naoki Naked.

708
00:39:00,187 --> 00:39:00,668
[SPEAKER_06]: That's good.

709
00:39:01,168 --> 00:39:01,549
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright.

710
00:39:04,311 --> 00:39:05,933
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, let's move on.

711
00:39:07,903 --> 00:39:08,724
[SPEAKER_15]: Sorry, I'm just checking.

712
00:39:09,145 --> 00:39:11,147
[SPEAKER_15]: I know, I'm just... Dynamic Duo.

713
00:39:11,427 --> 00:39:13,009
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm sorry, I was just closing private message rooms.

714
00:39:13,189 --> 00:39:17,674
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, Dynamic Duo says, Billy wishes they would put some... Dolphin Cry.

715
00:39:17,694 --> 00:39:18,474
[SPEAKER_15]: Dolphin Cry.

716
00:39:21,177 --> 00:39:22,499
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a sexual position, isn't it?

717
00:39:22,519 --> 00:39:23,720
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, Dynamic Duo is a good one.

718
00:39:34,224 --> 00:39:35,626
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, I said, um...

719
00:39:45,746 --> 00:39:48,928
[SPEAKER_15]: My answer was Billy the Big Homosexual loved to play Gabe Imani songs.

720
00:39:48,988 --> 00:39:54,172
[SPEAKER_15]: He really wished they would put more Para songs into DR. Yay, you're a B!

721
00:39:55,953 --> 00:39:57,814
[SPEAKER_15]: More Parabar songs, unfortunately.

722
00:39:58,475 --> 00:39:59,635
[SPEAKER_06]: Not a match.

723
00:40:00,516 --> 00:40:01,717
[SPEAKER_15]: Shine loose to both our contestants.

724
00:40:01,737 --> 00:40:03,138
[SPEAKER_15]: The OSFBB is still up by one.

725
00:40:03,498 --> 00:40:05,439
[SPEAKER_15]: Black Lab, this is your last chance to catch up.

726
00:40:05,479 --> 00:40:05,940
[SPEAKER_15]: Here we go.

727
00:40:09,302 --> 00:40:12,004
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, we had a request to hear the dolphin cry one more time.

728
00:40:15,421 --> 00:40:15,821
[SPEAKER_13]: Come on.

729
00:40:18,523 --> 00:40:19,843
[SPEAKER_13]: They call him Flipper.

730
00:40:21,364 --> 00:40:21,945
[SPEAKER_15]: All right, thank you.

731
00:40:22,485 --> 00:40:23,185
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, here we go.

732
00:40:26,387 --> 00:40:27,548
[SPEAKER_15]: All right, last question.

733
00:40:27,568 --> 00:40:27,968
[SPEAKER_15]: Here we go.

734
00:40:28,068 --> 00:40:32,390
[SPEAKER_15]: Last chance to catch up, Black Lab.

735
00:40:34,091 --> 00:40:40,335
[SPEAKER_15]: We predict on next week's drunk show, Jamie is going to get so drunk that she ends up blank.

736
00:40:45,413 --> 00:40:50,736
[SPEAKER_15]: We predict on next week's drunk show, Jamie is going to get so drunk that she ends up blank.

737
00:40:50,876 --> 00:40:51,936
I have it.

738
00:40:52,056 --> 00:40:52,717
I have it.

739
00:41:16,043 --> 00:41:17,424
La la la, I'm still thinking.

740
00:41:17,444 --> 00:41:19,404
Why did I put this question in there?

741
00:41:19,424 --> 00:41:20,565
This is a hard one.

742
00:41:31,508 --> 00:41:31,849
[SPEAKER_06]: Rob.

743
00:41:31,869 --> 00:41:31,949
[SPEAKER_06]: Rob.

744
00:41:31,989 --> 00:41:32,289
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

745
00:41:32,329 --> 00:41:32,669
[SPEAKER_06]: Rob.

746
00:41:32,730 --> 00:41:33,210
[SPEAKER_06]: Rob.

747
00:41:33,250 --> 00:41:33,350
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi.

748
00:41:33,671 --> 00:41:33,851
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi.

749
00:41:33,991 --> 00:41:34,431
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

750
00:41:34,572 --> 00:41:37,815
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, the contestants aren't locked in yet.

751
00:41:37,835 --> 00:41:39,377
[SPEAKER_06]: They still haven't sent.

752
00:41:54,890 --> 00:41:58,191
[SPEAKER_15]: We predict on next week's Drunk Show, Jamie's going to get so drunk that she ends up blank.

753
00:41:58,211 --> 00:41:59,192
[SPEAKER_15]: We're waiting on the contestants.

754
00:41:59,232 --> 00:42:00,152
[SPEAKER_15]: All the celebrities are in?

755
00:42:00,792 --> 00:42:01,072
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

756
00:42:01,592 --> 00:42:02,813
[SPEAKER_15]: We're just waiting for the two contestants.

757
00:42:03,333 --> 00:42:04,053
[SPEAKER_15]: Any day now, you two.

758
00:42:05,154 --> 00:42:05,514
[SPEAKER_15]: One's in.

759
00:42:09,695 --> 00:42:10,936
[SPEAKER_15]: Waiting on one more contestant.

760
00:42:13,277 --> 00:42:15,397
[SPEAKER_15]: Are you waving your Raybar light around?

761
00:42:17,058 --> 00:42:19,119
[SPEAKER_15]: I wonder if we're getting a big long paragraph or something.

762
00:42:21,604 --> 00:42:28,066
[SPEAKER_15]: Jamie knows it's all in good fun, but she reserves the right to cut you.

763
00:42:28,366 --> 00:42:29,106
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright, here we go.

764
00:42:30,147 --> 00:42:30,527
[SPEAKER_15]: Here we go.

765
00:42:31,607 --> 00:42:33,488
[SPEAKER_15]: We'll start off with the person in the lead.

766
00:42:33,528 --> 00:42:39,990
[SPEAKER_15]: We predict on next week's Drunk Show, EOSFVB says Jamie is going to get so drunk that she ends up lesbian.

767
00:42:42,991 --> 00:42:43,951
[SPEAKER_15]: That got three blinks.

768
00:42:46,252 --> 00:42:51,578
[SPEAKER_15]: Black Lab says... Black Lab also says lesbian.

769
00:42:51,598 --> 00:42:54,021
[SPEAKER_15]: She's gonna get so drunk she ends up lesbian.

770
00:42:56,403 --> 00:42:58,245
[SPEAKER_15]: Is that because we all get gay when we drink?

771
00:42:59,727 --> 00:43:00,868
[SPEAKER_15]: Do I go straight when I drink?

772
00:43:01,509 --> 00:43:02,350
[SPEAKER_15]: Actually, I kinda do.

773
00:43:04,836 --> 00:43:10,978
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, don't you people know that I already have made the vow that if Dan and I ever break up, I'm getting a girlfriend?

774
00:43:11,799 --> 00:43:14,680
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I hate men anyway, mostly.

775
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:15,800
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright.

776
00:43:19,581 --> 00:43:22,863
[SPEAKER_02]: I just don't find anything about that as funny.

777
00:43:23,703 --> 00:43:24,743
[SPEAKER_15]: Because men love lesbians.

778
00:43:24,963 --> 00:43:25,263
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright.

779
00:43:26,924 --> 00:43:29,465
[SPEAKER_15]: Jamie's gonna get so drunk she... Ends up saying...

780
00:43:30,237 --> 00:43:31,118
[SPEAKER_15]: Ends up sane.

781
00:43:31,178 --> 00:43:32,079
[SPEAKER_15]: That's a good answer.

782
00:43:32,679 --> 00:43:33,060
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright.

783
00:43:35,022 --> 00:43:35,822
[SPEAKER_15]: Next up, Loki.

784
00:43:35,862 --> 00:43:39,606
[SPEAKER_15]: She ends up... Mine's always... Yeah.

785
00:43:40,206 --> 00:43:43,169
[SPEAKER_15]: I said... I said lesbian, dammit!

786
00:43:44,110 --> 00:43:45,471
[SPEAKER_15]: So they get a point each.

787
00:43:45,511 --> 00:43:46,372
[SPEAKER_15]: They get a point each.

788
00:43:47,373 --> 00:43:50,135
[SPEAKER_15]: Too bad it's... They answered the same thing.

789
00:43:50,255 --> 00:43:50,556
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright.

790
00:43:53,530 --> 00:43:55,211
[SPEAKER_15]: Billy, she ends up... Naked.

791
00:43:55,511 --> 00:43:55,952
[SPEAKER_15]: Naked.

792
00:43:58,533 --> 00:43:58,974
[SPEAKER_15]: Good answer.

793
00:43:59,034 --> 00:44:05,638
[SPEAKER_16]: Zero, she ends up... I thought I was going to be original with this, but lesbian is what I came up with.

794
00:44:06,159 --> 00:44:06,859
[SPEAKER_15]: Two points.

795
00:44:07,039 --> 00:44:07,379
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright.

796
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:09,161
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, it's too easy.

797
00:44:09,201 --> 00:44:09,961
[SPEAKER_15]: It's the easy answer.

798
00:44:10,361 --> 00:44:11,262
[SPEAKER_15]: It's the cop-out answer.

799
00:44:11,342 --> 00:44:15,005
[SPEAKER_15]: Brad Dave put... Do the lead-in.

800
00:44:16,105 --> 00:44:21,589
[SPEAKER_15]: Jamie's going to get so drunk that she... Ends up... Ends up... Using the microphone.

801
00:44:21,849 --> 00:44:22,590
[SPEAKER_14]: Use your imagination.

802
00:44:29,571 --> 00:44:30,251
[SPEAKER_18]: Put out your hand.

803
00:44:32,912 --> 00:44:35,574
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm starting to hurt.

804
00:44:36,734 --> 00:44:40,776
[SPEAKER_15]: Now, mine's, amazingly enough, I think I have the most PG-rated answer.

805
00:44:41,756 --> 00:44:45,818
[SPEAKER_15]: Jamie's going to end up so drunk that she ends up making out with a Happy Bunny doll.

806
00:44:48,619 --> 00:44:49,340
[SPEAKER_02]: No, mine was.

807
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:49,960
[SPEAKER_02]: I said same.

808
00:44:50,100 --> 00:44:50,500
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, that's true.

809
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:51,080
[SPEAKER_15]: You said same.

810
00:44:51,161 --> 00:44:52,341
[SPEAKER_15]: You had the G-rated answer.

811
00:44:53,021 --> 00:44:54,322
[SPEAKER_02]: I just kicked you.

812
00:44:55,282 --> 00:44:55,602
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

813
00:44:55,703 --> 00:44:57,643
[SPEAKER_15]: So, the final scores.

814
00:44:57,723 --> 00:44:58,624
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's tally them up.

815
00:44:59,858 --> 00:45:01,700
[SPEAKER_15]: Black Lab has two points.

816
00:45:02,521 --> 00:45:05,063
[SPEAKER_15]: EOSFVB wins tonight with three points.

817
00:45:05,143 --> 00:45:05,964
[SPEAKER_15]: Congratulations.

818
00:45:05,984 --> 00:45:07,005
[SPEAKER_02]: You win a bottle of Propel.

819
00:45:07,485 --> 00:45:08,567
[SPEAKER_15]: You win nothing.

820
00:45:09,267 --> 00:45:11,129
[SPEAKER_02]: You win a bottle of Propel, but you have to go buy it yourself.

821
00:45:11,870 --> 00:45:12,650
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, great.

822
00:45:13,732 --> 00:45:14,192
[SPEAKER_15]: Beautiful.

823
00:45:15,453 --> 00:45:17,215
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you to all the stars.

824
00:45:17,255 --> 00:45:19,557
[SPEAKER_02]: This show was brought to you by Propel and Balls.

825
00:45:19,877 --> 00:45:21,299
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody needs to come and bring me some balls.

826
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:23,121
[SPEAKER_15]: No rave, please.

827
00:45:24,162 --> 00:45:24,462
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

828
00:45:25,563 --> 00:45:29,145
[SPEAKER_02]: The light switch was installed so you could turn the light on and off.

829
00:45:29,745 --> 00:45:31,306
[SPEAKER_02]: Not so you could throw light switch rave.

830
00:45:35,908 --> 00:45:36,328
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

831
00:45:37,009 --> 00:45:40,511
[SPEAKER_15]: So, I think we're going to go to another break.

832
00:45:40,631 --> 00:45:42,011
[SPEAKER_15]: I have to ask JB some questions.

833
00:45:42,071 --> 00:45:43,192
[SPEAKER_15]: JB sent me a remix.

834
00:45:43,252 --> 00:45:44,052
[SPEAKER_15]: No rave, please.

835
00:45:44,152 --> 00:45:44,413
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

836
00:45:45,013 --> 00:45:46,093
[SPEAKER_15]: JB sent me a remix.

837
00:45:47,234 --> 00:45:48,915
[SPEAKER_15]: Is this one you did yourself, JB?

838
00:45:48,955 --> 00:45:49,655
[SPEAKER_15]: That's what I want to know.

839
00:45:49,895 --> 00:45:50,676
[SPEAKER_15]: Can you let me know that?

840
00:45:51,356 --> 00:45:52,997
[SPEAKER_15]: Because we're going to play that going into this next break.

841
00:45:55,294 --> 00:45:56,535
[SPEAKER_15]: CageMatch, we'll do what?

842
00:45:56,555 --> 00:45:57,415
[SPEAKER_15]: You want to do CageMatch next?

843
00:45:57,955 --> 00:45:58,035
[SPEAKER_15]: Sure.

844
00:45:58,055 --> 00:45:58,875
[SPEAKER_15]: We can do CageMatch in a little while.

845
00:45:59,856 --> 00:46:00,116
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright.

846
00:46:00,136 --> 00:46:00,916
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll do CageMatch next.

847
00:46:01,016 --> 00:46:02,136
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, we'll do CageMatch next.

848
00:46:03,277 --> 00:46:04,817
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, we're going to do CageMatch next when we come back.

849
00:46:04,837 --> 00:46:05,638
[SPEAKER_15]: We'll take a quick break.

850
00:46:05,658 --> 00:46:07,318
[SPEAKER_15]: I think we're just going to do a one-song break.

851
00:46:08,299 --> 00:46:11,020
[SPEAKER_15]: And I just want to know if this is... I already know that I'm going to win.

852
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:13,560
[SPEAKER_15]: I just want to know if this is JB's own remix or not.

853
00:46:13,580 --> 00:46:14,841
[SPEAKER_15]: I already know that I'm going to win.

854
00:46:14,861 --> 00:46:15,741
[SPEAKER_15]: So that was a fun match game.

855
00:46:15,761 --> 00:46:16,801
[SPEAKER_15]: We haven't done a match game in a few weeks.

856
00:46:16,821 --> 00:46:18,182
[SPEAKER_15]: It's been about a month since we've done a match game.

857
00:46:20,251 --> 00:46:21,892
[SPEAKER_12]: Is there a topic for Listless yet?

858
00:46:22,092 --> 00:46:22,892
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't win last time.

859
00:46:23,392 --> 00:46:25,032
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know if we'll do Listless now.

860
00:46:25,072 --> 00:46:27,033
[SPEAKER_15]: We might take a week off from Listless.

861
00:46:27,053 --> 00:46:28,954
[SPEAKER_02]: Didn't I get dethroned by the cussing song last week?

862
00:46:29,254 --> 00:46:29,554
[SPEAKER_15]: The what?

863
00:46:30,014 --> 00:46:31,134
[SPEAKER_02]: Didn't the cussing song win last week?

864
00:46:31,154 --> 00:46:32,374
[SPEAKER_02]: No, the cussing song did not win last week.

865
00:46:32,394 --> 00:46:32,755
[SPEAKER_02]: I won, didn't I?

866
00:46:32,895 --> 00:46:35,235
[SPEAKER_15]: Remember, Jenny Bean had the tiebreaker vote.

867
00:46:35,415 --> 00:46:38,216
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, you brought a cage match song and everything?

868
00:46:38,236 --> 00:46:38,596
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

869
00:46:38,736 --> 00:46:39,196
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, I'm sorry.

870
00:46:39,797 --> 00:46:41,017
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I can dethrone it myself.

871
00:46:45,402 --> 00:46:45,722
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

872
00:46:46,542 --> 00:46:49,144
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, we'll just play Jamie's song at some point during the show during another break.

873
00:46:49,164 --> 00:46:49,924
[SPEAKER_15]: And I'll pick a different song.

874
00:46:50,424 --> 00:46:50,664
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

875
00:46:52,165 --> 00:46:53,646
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so... What do we just play during this break?

876
00:46:54,166 --> 00:46:55,207
[SPEAKER_15]: You just want to play your song?

877
00:46:55,547 --> 00:46:56,167
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, why not?

878
00:46:56,247 --> 00:46:56,507
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

879
00:46:56,827 --> 00:47:01,010
[SPEAKER_15]: Then we'll save, because I haven't gotten the answer on JB's mix if it was him or not, so I'll wait on that.

880
00:47:01,490 --> 00:47:03,451
[SPEAKER_15]: And in the meantime, we'll play... It's the song that Puppy sent me.

881
00:47:03,891 --> 00:47:04,151
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

882
00:47:04,491 --> 00:47:04,971
[SPEAKER_15]: So what is it?

883
00:47:05,012 --> 00:47:05,832
[SPEAKER_15]: Describe this for us, Jamie.

884
00:47:07,316 --> 00:47:08,476
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think it needs any description.

885
00:47:09,177 --> 00:47:09,597
[SPEAKER_02]: Just play it.

886
00:47:10,238 --> 00:47:11,438
[SPEAKER_15]: No description needed, huh?

887
00:47:11,859 --> 00:47:12,079
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

888
00:47:12,359 --> 00:47:12,699
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright.

889
00:47:12,779 --> 00:47:13,560
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just a cool song.

890
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:17,082
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, we're going to play this and we'll be right back.

891
00:47:17,122 --> 00:47:21,845
[SPEAKER_15]: We'll play this and another quick song and then we'll be back on Orange Lounge Radio with the Cage Match.

892
00:51:33,035 --> 00:51:41,643
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi-ho, Kermit the Frog here, informing you that today's broadcast of Orange Lounge Radio is brought to you by the letter B, the letter A, and the number 59.

893
00:51:41,723 --> 00:51:47,668
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you tell me how to get, how to get to Sesame Street?

894
00:51:48,228 --> 00:51:50,370
[SPEAKER_15]: We are back!

895
00:51:50,390 --> 00:51:54,114
[SPEAKER_15]: Oops, I accidentally had the repeat thing on.

896
00:51:54,514 --> 00:51:59,078
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, we're just trying to recover from that Magic Game segment.

897
00:51:59,484 --> 00:52:00,106
[SPEAKER_15]: Billy left.

898
00:52:00,166 --> 00:52:01,368
[SPEAKER_15]: He says goodbye to everybody.

899
00:52:01,428 --> 00:52:04,032
[SPEAKER_15]: He had to go fuck somebody in the house.

900
00:52:04,072 --> 00:52:04,353
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know.

901
00:52:06,777 --> 00:52:09,442
[SPEAKER_15]: So, we're back and we're chilling.

902
00:52:10,323 --> 00:52:10,924
[SPEAKER_15]: How are y'all doing?

903
00:52:10,944 --> 00:52:11,345
[SPEAKER_15]: How was your week?

904
00:52:13,203 --> 00:52:15,264
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know what they're doing in the other room.

905
00:52:15,324 --> 00:52:16,864
[SPEAKER_15]: I hope my roommate's not trying to sleep, is he?

906
00:52:17,064 --> 00:52:17,845
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, good, he's not.

907
00:52:18,945 --> 00:52:21,486
[SPEAKER_02]: My week was a big pile of ass.

908
00:52:21,846 --> 00:52:22,306
[SPEAKER_02]: Why, what happened?

909
00:52:22,507 --> 00:52:24,947
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I don't know, it was okay.

910
00:52:25,167 --> 00:52:29,529
[SPEAKER_02]: I got some hanging out and did lots of busy, rocky things.

911
00:52:30,650 --> 00:52:31,930
[SPEAKER_02]: I went costume hunting a bunch.

912
00:52:32,510 --> 00:52:33,751
[SPEAKER_02]: I still couldn't find a damn globe.

913
00:52:34,171 --> 00:52:35,611
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we haven't done our fuck-yous.

914
00:52:36,732 --> 00:52:37,572
[SPEAKER_15]: We'll do the fuck-yous a little later.

915
00:52:38,052 --> 00:52:39,373
[SPEAKER_15]: We always do the fuck-yous towards the beginning.

916
00:52:39,413 --> 00:52:40,573
[SPEAKER_15]: I figure we'll save it towards the end.

917
00:52:40,593 --> 00:52:42,174
[SPEAKER_02]: And last night was just insane.

918
00:52:44,028 --> 00:52:48,813
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that I don't remember much of last night because I was not feeling happy.

919
00:52:48,993 --> 00:52:50,234
[SPEAKER_15]: Last night was crazy.

920
00:52:50,354 --> 00:52:51,596
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, yes, definitely.

921
00:52:52,336 --> 00:52:53,598
[SPEAKER_02]: And you were fabulous.

922
00:52:53,898 --> 00:52:54,258
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

923
00:52:54,779 --> 00:53:00,184
[SPEAKER_15]: For those that don't know, we're here in Orange Lounge World Radio headquarters in Sacramento, California.

924
00:53:00,244 --> 00:53:06,731
[SPEAKER_15]: A lot of us that are involved here with the show are also involved with the local production of Rocky Horror Picture Show, so we were doing that last night.

925
00:53:07,231 --> 00:53:08,371
[SPEAKER_15]: and that was a lot of energy.

926
00:53:08,431 --> 00:53:11,752
[SPEAKER_15]: So if we seem a little dead tonight, we're still kind of recovering from last night.

927
00:53:12,172 --> 00:53:18,554
[SPEAKER_15]: However, Jamie was kind enough to go to Walgreens and get some double shots drinks of those coffee things.

928
00:53:18,574 --> 00:53:19,334
[SPEAKER_02]: Starbucks double shots.

929
00:53:19,374 --> 00:53:19,594
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

930
00:53:20,155 --> 00:53:26,136
[SPEAKER_02]: So actually this episode of Orange Lodge Radio not only is brought to you by Propel and Ass.

931
00:53:26,176 --> 00:53:27,377
[SPEAKER_02]: Or Ass Flavor Propel.

932
00:53:27,657 --> 00:53:32,018
[SPEAKER_02]: It's brought to you by Starbucks double shot vehicle, you know, drink.

933
00:53:32,738 --> 00:53:32,938
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

934
00:53:33,778 --> 00:53:34,699
[SPEAKER_02]: Bitter Ass Coffee.

935
00:53:35,099 --> 00:53:36,319
[SPEAKER_15]: How was your week, Loki?

936
00:53:37,887 --> 00:53:39,630
[SPEAKER_17]: I went and played Cuser last night.

937
00:53:40,933 --> 00:53:42,355
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, didn't you have a story about this?

938
00:53:44,018 --> 00:53:45,962
[SPEAKER_15]: You've got plenty of FUs besides this.

939
00:53:45,982 --> 00:53:46,763
[SPEAKER_15]: Come on, tell the story.

940
00:53:47,922 --> 00:53:50,063
[SPEAKER_17]: Yesterday was interesting.

941
00:53:50,083 --> 00:53:52,784
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, Zero went with me, so he can, you know, okay.

942
00:53:53,045 --> 00:53:53,585
[SPEAKER_17]: It was great.

943
00:53:53,985 --> 00:53:54,645
[SPEAKER_17]: It was good.

944
00:53:55,386 --> 00:54:00,028
[SPEAKER_17]: Vacaville, you know, it's really close, a lot closer than Concord or Pleasanton.

945
00:54:00,108 --> 00:54:00,928
[SPEAKER_16]: Stay away.

946
00:54:01,268 --> 00:54:01,729
[SPEAKER_17]: It was nice.

947
00:54:02,729 --> 00:54:06,111
[SPEAKER_17]: Now, the bowling alley, it's actually in Sars Entertainment.

948
00:54:06,511 --> 00:54:07,751
[SPEAKER_17]: It's like a bowling alley type place.

949
00:54:07,771 --> 00:54:11,813
[SPEAKER_17]: They've got, like, a nice restaurant in there and, like, pizza and an arcade and stuff.

950
00:54:12,254 --> 00:54:12,674
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.

951
00:54:13,474 --> 00:54:20,503
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm sure I'll go into this with my FUs later on, but they had Fifth Mix and Max 2 there, both in really poor condition.

952
00:54:20,623 --> 00:54:21,164
[SPEAKER_17]: Very poor.

953
00:54:22,566 --> 00:54:24,849
[SPEAKER_17]: Everything was broken there.

954
00:54:24,929 --> 00:54:28,473
[SPEAKER_17]: Even the soda machine was pretty much all randomized.

955
00:54:28,513 --> 00:54:30,676
[SPEAKER_17]: You'd pick one soda and get something else.

956
00:54:31,276 --> 00:54:33,277
[SPEAKER_16]: The soda machine was like roulette.

957
00:54:33,937 --> 00:54:35,598
[SPEAKER_16]: If you touched it, you didn't get what you wanted.

958
00:54:36,258 --> 00:54:41,100
[SPEAKER_17]: And then, um, now the Cusar was the worst run Cusar I've ever seen.

959
00:54:42,001 --> 00:54:46,983
[SPEAKER_17]: The arena was awesome, the packs were in good condition, but it was the worst run Cusar.

960
00:54:47,923 --> 00:54:48,143
[SPEAKER_17]: Ever.

961
00:54:48,303 --> 00:54:49,824
[SPEAKER_17]: And there was annoying people there.

962
00:54:50,564 --> 00:54:52,865
[SPEAKER_17]: Vacaville was full of hicks and wannabe gangstas.

963
00:54:52,905 --> 00:54:54,346
[SPEAKER_16]: Loki, what's a syringe?

964
00:54:55,547 --> 00:54:55,827
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

965
00:54:56,727 --> 00:54:57,908
[SPEAKER_17]: We'll go into that later.

966
00:54:58,368 --> 00:54:58,788
[SPEAKER_17]: But, uh,

967
00:55:00,449 --> 00:55:01,210
[SPEAKER_16]: It was interesting.

968
00:55:01,290 --> 00:55:05,231
[SPEAKER_17]: It became more fun later on when all the stupid people started leaving.

969
00:55:05,271 --> 00:55:05,832
[SPEAKER_02]: It sounded like ass.

970
00:55:06,912 --> 00:55:07,212
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.

971
00:55:07,572 --> 00:55:07,993
[SPEAKER_17]: Very much.

972
00:55:08,373 --> 00:55:15,496
[SPEAKER_17]: So that and the lack of sleep I've been doing the last few days because I've been going to bed at like 6 in the morning and getting like 3 hours of sleep.

973
00:55:18,703 --> 00:55:22,065
[SPEAKER_15]: As far as my week goes, I've been kind of getting ready for Rocky 2.

974
00:55:22,225 --> 00:55:22,706
[SPEAKER_15]: I've done a lot.

975
00:55:22,726 --> 00:55:24,587
[SPEAKER_15]: I went out and played Bomani, I think, one time this week.

976
00:55:24,607 --> 00:55:28,049
[SPEAKER_15]: I found that I'm suddenly, all of a sudden, I'm really into DDR Extreme.

977
00:55:28,069 --> 00:55:29,610
[SPEAKER_15]: Like, all of a sudden, I'm into DDR again.

978
00:55:29,930 --> 00:55:34,413
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think a lot of that has to do with Jamie on Lomi, her fifth mix, so I can make some link data.

979
00:55:35,113 --> 00:55:36,754
[SPEAKER_15]: So I can make some new link data for Extreme.

980
00:55:37,035 --> 00:55:38,856
[SPEAKER_15]: And now, like, I have something to accomplish.

981
00:55:38,916 --> 00:55:40,977
[SPEAKER_15]: Like, oh my gods, I've got to get a double A on this.

982
00:55:41,838 --> 00:55:44,339
[SPEAKER_15]: We need to re... I'm sorry, Jamie?

983
00:55:44,599 --> 00:55:46,320
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to set our night where we do nothing but DDR.

984
00:55:46,420 --> 00:55:47,121
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm looking at the audio.

985
00:55:47,651 --> 00:55:55,195
[SPEAKER_15]: We kind of used to do those on Friday night, but that physical... Well, we used to, way in the day, we did it on Wednesday night, but then I started going to karaoke, except I'm not even going anymore, so maybe we could just do Wednesdays again.

986
00:55:55,875 --> 00:55:56,575
[SPEAKER_15]: So, maybe that'll work.

987
00:55:56,656 --> 00:55:57,976
[SPEAKER_16]: I need to get a copy of Fifth.

988
00:55:58,056 --> 00:55:59,897
[SPEAKER_16]: I need to start making edits so bad.

989
00:56:00,157 --> 00:56:02,498
[SPEAKER_16]: I do fourth edits all the time, and they're getting kind of old now.

990
00:56:02,638 --> 00:56:04,279
[SPEAKER_15]: We can probably get you a copy of Fifth one way or another.

991
00:56:04,439 --> 00:56:08,081
[SPEAKER_15]: If Jamie lets me keep her copy a couple more days, I'll make you a copy.

992
00:56:08,101 --> 00:56:10,182
[SPEAKER_16]: I brought you, like, ten CDs to burn stuff on.

993
00:56:10,602 --> 00:56:10,963
[SPEAKER_16]: Cool!

994
00:56:11,943 --> 00:56:12,723
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright, whatever works.

995
00:56:14,064 --> 00:56:15,345
[SPEAKER_15]: We don't endorse pirating on this show.

996
00:56:15,385 --> 00:56:15,685
[SPEAKER_15]: No, we don't.

997
00:56:17,256 --> 00:56:18,436
[SPEAKER_15]: Actually, I'll be honest.

998
00:56:20,137 --> 00:56:20,598
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll be honest.

999
00:56:20,618 --> 00:56:22,359
[SPEAKER_15]: We never really talked about this on Orange Launch Radio.

1000
00:56:22,379 --> 00:56:23,799
[SPEAKER_15]: Let me talk about my views on pirating games.

1001
00:56:24,840 --> 00:56:27,521
[SPEAKER_15]: As far as DDR is concerned, and the money stuff.

1002
00:56:28,742 --> 00:56:30,643
[SPEAKER_15]: Never the US ones, always the Japanese ones.

1003
00:56:31,143 --> 00:56:33,345
[SPEAKER_15]: And I say it's okay, because I think...

1004
00:56:34,225 --> 00:56:36,686
[SPEAKER_15]: The price you pay to import this stuff is just outrageous.

1005
00:56:36,706 --> 00:56:37,566
[SPEAKER_15]: To import this stuff from Japan.

1006
00:56:37,606 --> 00:56:40,627
[SPEAKER_15]: And honestly, if they wanted me to buy it, they'd release it in this country.

1007
00:56:40,687 --> 00:56:47,088
[SPEAKER_15]: So I figure if they're not going to release it in this country, if they're not going to take that effort to satisfy our demand by releasing it here, then I'm going to pirate it.

1008
00:56:47,568 --> 00:56:49,509
[SPEAKER_15]: But I have bought every U.S.

1009
00:56:49,569 --> 00:56:50,229
[SPEAKER_15]: Bomani release.

1010
00:56:50,389 --> 00:56:50,869
[SPEAKER_15]: Every one.

1011
00:56:51,089 --> 00:56:55,110
[SPEAKER_15]: Even the very crappy first USA mix, I bought it just because I wanted to support Bomani.

1012
00:56:55,170 --> 00:56:56,410
[SPEAKER_02]: And reserve them at GameStop.

1013
00:56:57,731 --> 00:56:58,671
[SPEAKER_02]: The one at Arden Fair Mall.

1014
00:56:58,731 --> 00:56:59,311
[SPEAKER_15]: Another plug.

1015
00:56:59,511 --> 00:57:07,275
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, even still, I think it's kind of crap that you have to buy their shit that they release in order for them to hopefully bring out better stuff later on.

1016
00:57:07,375 --> 00:57:08,535
[SPEAKER_17]: I think that's really stupid.

1017
00:57:08,595 --> 00:57:11,737
[SPEAKER_15]: They did, but DDR Max was pretty good, you have to admit.

1018
00:57:12,344 --> 00:57:15,746
[SPEAKER_17]: It was pretty good, but like, USA, the first one sucked ass.

1019
00:57:15,966 --> 00:57:23,950
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, and I played it maybe twice, but I felt, okay, this is kind of the way I felt, I said, okay, I played all those Japanese ones for free, so I played all these songs for free.

1020
00:57:24,010 --> 00:57:25,911
[SPEAKER_02]: But did you see the first one they released in Japan?

1021
00:57:25,971 --> 00:57:26,611
[SPEAKER_02]: It was kind of bad.

1022
00:57:26,631 --> 00:57:29,152
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, the one, well, but it had strictly business.

1023
00:57:29,412 --> 00:57:33,474
[SPEAKER_02]: In comparison, though, to everything since, you know, you have to start somewhere.

1024
00:57:33,814 --> 00:57:39,077
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, this is an old, old debate that goes, you know, back about a year now.

1025
00:57:39,377 --> 00:57:40,938
[SPEAKER_15]: Was that when USA was released, about a year ago?

1026
00:57:42,436 --> 00:57:42,898
[SPEAKER_15]: More than that.

1027
00:57:43,119 --> 00:57:45,128
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, that was a long time ago.

1028
00:57:45,248 --> 00:57:47,458
[SPEAKER_15]: The Disney mix, the USA one, I played that one time.

1029
00:57:49,087 --> 00:57:54,369
[SPEAKER_15]: I just don't even really play those songs, but I bought it just because I had played Disney's Rave a lot.

1030
00:57:54,849 --> 00:58:00,990
[SPEAKER_16]: So it was kind of my conscience.

1031
00:58:01,150 --> 00:58:04,991
[SPEAKER_15]: I think Somni Magus has my copy and doesn't realize it.

1032
00:58:05,011 --> 00:58:08,212
[SPEAKER_02]: I have the Japanese version sitting right in front of the US one in my collection at home.

1033
00:58:09,273 --> 00:58:11,873
[SPEAKER_15]: So I think I played it one time so I could get the maniac steps.

1034
00:58:11,993 --> 00:58:15,114
[SPEAKER_15]: And I wanted to see how hard the ten-footers were, and then I was unimpressed.

1035
00:58:16,395 --> 00:58:17,715
[SPEAKER_02]: Dance magic, enough said.

1036
00:58:18,021 --> 00:58:19,241
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, it's all about dance magic.

1037
00:58:20,742 --> 00:58:24,943
[SPEAKER_15]: So, um... Yeah, I say it's okay to pirate the Japanese ones.

1038
00:58:25,243 --> 00:58:25,963
[SPEAKER_02]: Is this your yo-yo?

1039
00:58:26,264 --> 00:58:26,804
[SPEAKER_15]: No, it's Brian's.

1040
00:58:27,184 --> 00:58:28,084
[SPEAKER_02]: Brian's yo-yo sucks.

1041
00:58:28,584 --> 00:58:28,984
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm sorry.

1042
00:58:29,805 --> 00:58:30,705
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm gonna get you a yo-yo.

1043
00:58:31,005 --> 00:58:32,025
[SPEAKER_15]: You can buy Brian a yo-yo.

1044
00:58:32,045 --> 00:58:32,825
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll buy Brian a yo-yo.

1045
00:58:32,906 --> 00:58:33,186
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright.

1046
00:58:34,886 --> 00:58:37,147
[SPEAKER_02]: So... I want a yo-yo ball right now.

1047
00:58:38,567 --> 00:58:40,368
[SPEAKER_15]: Do you want to talk Sim stuff?

1048
00:58:40,628 --> 00:58:41,128
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, Sim.

1049
00:58:42,108 --> 00:58:43,309
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, you want to talk about this?

1050
00:58:43,389 --> 00:58:43,649
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright.

1051
00:58:44,509 --> 00:58:45,589
[SPEAKER_15]: This was just announced this week.

1052
00:58:45,629 --> 00:58:47,530
[SPEAKER_15]: Konami in Japan's making a brand new game.

1053
00:58:48,956 --> 00:58:50,517
[SPEAKER_15]: It's called Aerobics Revolution.

1054
00:58:51,857 --> 00:58:54,318
[SPEAKER_15]: Tell me it doesn't remind you of an old school 8-bit game.

1055
00:58:54,338 --> 00:58:55,078
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Dance Aerobics.

1056
00:58:55,118 --> 00:58:55,558
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, it is.

1057
00:58:55,618 --> 00:58:56,359
[SPEAKER_15]: It's Dance Aerobics.

1058
00:58:56,419 --> 00:58:57,639
[SPEAKER_15]: I swear to God, it looks just like it.

1059
00:58:57,979 --> 00:58:58,800
[SPEAKER_02]: With DDR steps.

1060
00:58:58,820 --> 00:59:02,641
[SPEAKER_15]: But basically, it's going to be an aerobics game that uses your DDR mat.

1061
00:59:02,681 --> 00:59:03,321
[SPEAKER_15]: You know what you love it?

1062
00:59:03,341 --> 00:59:05,082
[SPEAKER_15]: And it looks like it has a little DDR sim mode.

1063
00:59:05,302 --> 00:59:08,083
[SPEAKER_15]: They're kind of taking diet mode and making it its own game, I guess.

1064
00:59:08,163 --> 00:59:08,503
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know.

1065
00:59:09,263 --> 00:59:10,424
[SPEAKER_15]: We don't really know much about this.

1066
00:59:12,264 --> 00:59:13,225
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks like it's a home one.

1067
00:59:13,545 --> 00:59:16,326
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, it's going to be a home release for PlayStation 2, and it's going to be out March 13th.

1068
00:59:17,126 --> 00:59:17,846
[SPEAKER_02]: Jamie's getting this.

1069
00:59:18,586 --> 00:59:26,129
[SPEAKER_15]: And it looks like it's going to follow the Shadow Dancers, kind of like a power mode, so it's probably got aerobics routines in it.

1070
00:59:27,309 --> 00:59:27,769
[SPEAKER_06]: That looks cool.

1071
00:59:27,789 --> 00:59:33,130
[SPEAKER_15]: And it'll probably keep track of how well you're doing by the feet.

1072
00:59:33,471 --> 00:59:33,991
[SPEAKER_15]: And you know what?

1073
00:59:34,491 --> 00:59:36,871
[SPEAKER_15]: Dance Aerobics was very similar, I thought.

1074
00:59:36,972 --> 00:59:37,492
[SPEAKER_15]: So we'll see.

1075
00:59:37,812 --> 00:59:38,392
[SPEAKER_15]: We'll compare.

1076
00:59:40,394 --> 00:59:43,537
[SPEAKER_15]: When this aerobics revolution comes out, we'll see how similar it was to dance aerobics.

1077
00:59:43,657 --> 00:59:45,700
[SPEAKER_15]: I did play dance aerobics one time back in the day.

1078
00:59:45,740 --> 00:59:47,642
[SPEAKER_15]: I borrowed a power pad from my best friend in elementary school.

1079
00:59:47,662 --> 00:59:48,823
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a power pad and I have dance aerobics.

1080
00:59:48,863 --> 00:59:49,103
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you?

1081
00:59:49,343 --> 00:59:51,105
[SPEAKER_15]: In track and field.

1082
00:59:51,225 --> 00:59:51,666
[SPEAKER_15]: You know what?

1083
00:59:52,407 --> 00:59:54,489
[SPEAKER_15]: On one week on Orange Lounge, we need to have a power pad night.

1084
00:59:54,509 --> 00:59:56,831
[SPEAKER_15]: We need to have the power pad Olympics on Orange Lounge Radio.

1085
00:59:58,328 --> 00:59:59,188
[SPEAKER_06]: I kicked your ass.

1086
00:59:59,288 --> 01:00:00,989
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, we're going to do that one night.

1087
01:00:01,349 --> 01:00:04,110
[SPEAKER_15]: We'll get a crowd here and we'll move the show out into the other room.

1088
01:00:04,130 --> 01:00:05,170
[SPEAKER_15]: We'll have the Power Pad Olympics.

1089
01:00:05,190 --> 01:00:05,690
[SPEAKER_15]: How's that sound?

1090
01:00:05,970 --> 01:00:06,191
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

1091
01:00:06,331 --> 01:00:06,831
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright, cool.

1092
01:00:06,931 --> 01:00:11,272
[SPEAKER_16]: It looks like that Dancerobics looks like he uses all the buttons, too.

1093
01:00:12,633 --> 01:00:14,673
[SPEAKER_16]: All six?

1094
01:00:14,813 --> 01:00:16,314
[SPEAKER_15]: It looks like there's almost one in the middle.

1095
01:00:16,374 --> 01:00:18,034
[SPEAKER_15]: You see how this one has it lit up?

1096
01:00:18,094 --> 01:00:20,035
[SPEAKER_15]: But I don't think there's a button on the... I don't think they would do that.

1097
01:00:20,195 --> 01:00:21,095
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, I don't know.

1098
01:00:21,135 --> 01:00:22,736
[SPEAKER_15]: Maybe it's just showing where your feet are supposed to be.

1099
01:00:22,756 --> 01:00:23,536
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe you're using one foot forward.

1100
01:00:23,576 --> 01:00:23,916
[SPEAKER_02]: See that?

1101
01:00:23,936 --> 01:00:25,337
[SPEAKER_15]: A lot of this is speculation.

1102
01:00:25,397 --> 01:00:26,037
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's move to the chat room.

1103
01:00:26,677 --> 01:00:31,678
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, we'll link the chatroom to this just in case you guys haven't heard about this yet and you want to look up the site like we're looking at right now.

1104
01:00:31,738 --> 01:00:32,058
[SPEAKER_15]: There it is.

1105
01:00:32,358 --> 01:00:35,019
[SPEAKER_15]: And if you're not in our chatroom, why the hell not?

1106
01:00:35,099 --> 01:00:39,579
[SPEAKER_15]: Get over to our website, orangelounge.skie.cx and click on chatroom.

1107
01:00:42,380 --> 01:00:44,900
[SPEAKER_02]: This game actually does look pretty interesting.

1108
01:00:45,420 --> 01:00:47,741
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm definitely going to get it when it's out.

1109
01:00:48,561 --> 01:00:50,541
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you might get a full review from me.

1110
01:00:50,961 --> 01:00:51,542
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright, sounds good.

1111
01:00:51,562 --> 01:00:53,442
[SPEAKER_17]: Whatever the fuck happened to Marshall B.?

1112
01:00:54,978 --> 01:00:58,420
[SPEAKER_15]: Wasn't, okay, I've seen the Marshall Beat Machine once in Arcade Infinity.

1113
01:00:58,440 --> 01:00:59,561
[SPEAKER_16]: They do have a home version of it.

1114
01:00:59,981 --> 01:01:00,862
[SPEAKER_15]: Don't they have a home version of it?

1115
01:01:00,882 --> 01:01:03,063
[SPEAKER_16]: They do, I played it just this week.

1116
01:01:04,925 --> 01:01:05,385
[SPEAKER_16]: Pretty much.

1117
01:01:06,226 --> 01:01:07,887
[SPEAKER_16]: It's, it's like, it's horrible.

1118
01:01:08,387 --> 01:01:09,908
[SPEAKER_16]: It has sensors on your hands and legs.

1119
01:01:09,948 --> 01:01:17,353
[SPEAKER_16]: There's a link to it, if you go, there's someone selling a bunch of them on eBay, and they'll send you to the Konami site where they actually talk about it.

1120
01:01:17,453 --> 01:01:18,534
[SPEAKER_16]: It looks so retarded.

1121
01:01:19,574 --> 01:01:21,856
[SPEAKER_16]: It's like you're fighting in Dance Beat.

1122
01:01:23,795 --> 01:01:24,536
[SPEAKER_15]: It's interesting.

1123
01:01:25,837 --> 01:01:31,082
[SPEAKER_15]: When Loki and I were at AI a couple weeks ago when we were off one week from the show, we were at Arcade Infinity.

1124
01:01:31,662 --> 01:01:35,346
[SPEAKER_15]: We saw a Marshall Beat Machine and not a damn person playing it the whole night.

1125
01:01:36,207 --> 01:01:38,509
[SPEAKER_15]: I thought I'd look like an idiot playing it.

1126
01:01:40,447 --> 01:01:42,627
[SPEAKER_17]: There's actually two versions of it for the home now.

1127
01:01:42,647 --> 01:01:45,708
[SPEAKER_17]: They have the first one, and I guess they just released the second one recently.

1128
01:02:05,213 --> 01:02:08,173
[SPEAKER_16]: I think they made the sequel before they made the first one.

1129
01:02:08,834 --> 01:02:09,474
[SPEAKER_16]: It was pretty bad.

1130
01:02:11,014 --> 01:02:12,515
[SPEAKER_16]: That just sounds like utter ass.

1131
01:02:14,735 --> 01:02:18,857
[SPEAKER_15]: Marshall Beat is missable, basically, is what we're all kind of coming to a consensus on.

1132
01:02:18,977 --> 01:02:20,437
[SPEAKER_17]: Was there any songs that weren't in DDR?

1133
01:02:20,997 --> 01:02:21,778
[SPEAKER_17]: Punch Mania.

1134
01:02:22,218 --> 01:02:22,758
[SPEAKER_17]: Crap.

1135
01:02:24,178 --> 01:02:25,399
[SPEAKER_02]: But Gun Mania is cool.

1136
01:02:26,619 --> 01:02:27,720
[SPEAKER_02]: Gun Mania is cool.

1137
01:02:28,440 --> 01:02:29,060
[SPEAKER_15]: Gun Mania is cool.

1138
01:02:29,080 --> 01:02:30,080
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the pellet shooting game.

1139
01:02:31,521 --> 01:02:32,001
[SPEAKER_02]: Gun Mania.

1140
01:02:33,058 --> 01:02:34,658
[SPEAKER_02]: They had an AI, but it's always broken.

1141
01:02:35,239 --> 01:02:37,479
[SPEAKER_02]: I made a joke that I was going to move in there and build a bed in there.

1142
01:02:37,999 --> 01:02:38,780
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it's large enough.

1143
01:02:39,100 --> 01:02:39,680
[SPEAKER_14]: It's huge.

1144
01:02:41,280 --> 01:02:41,580
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright.

1145
01:02:44,161 --> 01:02:45,041
[SPEAKER_14]: Moving right along.

1146
01:02:48,522 --> 01:02:51,603
[SPEAKER_15]: We'll look into that after the show, what we're being told in the show right now.

1147
01:02:53,503 --> 01:02:54,464
[SPEAKER_15]: What else is going on in DD World?

1148
01:02:54,504 --> 01:02:55,764
[SPEAKER_15]: Is anything going on in SimWorld, Loki?

1149
01:02:58,942 --> 01:03:00,063
[SPEAKER_15]: You want to talk about sim stuff, Loki?

1150
01:03:00,723 --> 01:03:01,984
[SPEAKER_17]: Uh, okay, I guess.

1151
01:03:03,285 --> 01:03:06,227
[SPEAKER_17]: Let's see, they've got another style 2003 still going on.

1152
01:03:06,387 --> 01:03:08,869
[SPEAKER_17]: That's that other DWI contest thingy.

1153
01:03:11,070 --> 01:03:16,474
[SPEAKER_17]: My site is coming up someday, so that'll be it.

1154
01:03:16,514 --> 01:03:20,896
[SPEAKER_17]: But my site is releasing more of the DDR Extreme sim files.

1155
01:03:21,557 --> 01:03:24,379
[SPEAKER_17]: You can find them with the backgrounds and all that wonderful stuff.

1156
01:03:24,459 --> 01:03:26,140
[SPEAKER_15]: Are they still having Jesus Complex about it?

1157
01:03:26,644 --> 01:03:27,684
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't know, I don't care anymore.

1158
01:03:28,385 --> 01:03:39,329
[SPEAKER_17]: Um, they're also doing a full re-release on all the, uh, old, uh, official sim files, and they're doing them with, uh, CD, um, what was it, the, uh, little CD banner things on there also.

1159
01:03:40,470 --> 01:03:49,033
[SPEAKER_17]: Um, and then, see, actually, all the, um, DDR Extreme ones have been released with banners, just not by Romani style.

1160
01:03:49,313 --> 01:03:50,974
[SPEAKER_17]: They're on another site, but I can't remember which one.

1161
01:03:51,554 --> 01:03:52,194
[SPEAKER_17]: So no help there.

1162
01:03:52,254 --> 01:03:53,295
[SPEAKER_17]: Just look on DDR Freak.

1163
01:03:53,335 --> 01:03:54,595
[SPEAKER_17]: Or not DDR Freak.

1164
01:03:54,635 --> 01:03:55,535
[SPEAKER_17]: DDR Maniacs.

1165
01:03:55,575 --> 01:03:56,956
[SPEAKER_17]: You'll find a link for it, I'm sure.

1166
01:03:56,976 --> 01:04:00,317
[SPEAKER_17]: Let's see.

1167
01:04:00,397 --> 01:04:03,738
[SPEAKER_17]: Other than that, not too much going on at all.

1168
01:04:04,238 --> 01:04:06,898
[SPEAKER_17]: It's been incredibly slow.

1169
01:04:08,639 --> 01:04:10,059
[SPEAKER_17]: No real sim updates.

1170
01:04:10,119 --> 01:04:18,602
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, they had a CSB snapshot update of Step Mania that they're working on that was released back on the...

1171
01:04:19,682 --> 01:04:19,882
[SPEAKER_17]: D.W.I 2.4

1172
01:04:34,221 --> 01:04:34,941
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't know.

1173
01:04:35,182 --> 01:04:36,363
[SPEAKER_17]: There's nothing going on.

1174
01:04:36,583 --> 01:04:37,884
[SPEAKER_17]: Just forget it.

1175
01:04:37,984 --> 01:04:38,545
[SPEAKER_17]: Slow.

1176
01:04:38,905 --> 01:04:46,411
[SPEAKER_17]: Just watch DDR Maniacs and BomaniSims.com for homemade stuff because you'll find the most released stuff there.

1177
01:04:47,772 --> 01:04:50,455
[SPEAKER_17]: Bomani style, you'll find the official stuff there.

1178
01:04:51,796 --> 01:04:53,197
[SPEAKER_17]: That's pretty much it.

1179
01:04:53,877 --> 01:04:59,782
[SPEAKER_17]: Check the Japanese sites because there's always all these Japanese sites you guys are missing and they have really cool shit on there.

1180
01:05:01,284 --> 01:05:01,544
[SPEAKER_15]: Cool.

1181
01:05:03,661 --> 01:05:10,083
[SPEAKER_15]: And of course, the most notable news in the DWI sim file world, Orange Lounge Radio is doing a contest.

1182
01:05:10,263 --> 01:05:12,664
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, we're doing a contest.

1183
01:05:13,084 --> 01:05:13,384
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright.

1184
01:05:15,685 --> 01:05:18,246
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, so why not, let's do the cage match now?

1185
01:05:19,186 --> 01:05:19,586
[SPEAKER_15]: Shall we?

1186
01:05:19,806 --> 01:05:20,246
[SPEAKER_15]: Sure!

1187
01:05:21,026 --> 01:05:21,407
[SPEAKER_15]: Why not?

1188
01:05:23,127 --> 01:05:27,208
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright, well I gotta queue up some stuff, so fill time while I queue up all the cage match stuff.

1189
01:05:27,228 --> 01:05:29,929
[SPEAKER_02]: Filling time, filling time, filling up the time.

1190
01:05:30,309 --> 01:05:32,010
[SPEAKER_15]: What was the funniest thing that happened to you this week, Jamie?

1191
01:05:33,587 --> 01:05:39,815
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw Robin drag.

1192
01:05:41,357 --> 01:05:42,318
[SPEAKER_02]: Like a big old queen.

1193
01:05:42,338 --> 01:05:44,100
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it was great.

1194
01:05:44,220 --> 01:05:44,621
[SPEAKER_02]: You were great.

1195
01:05:45,442 --> 01:05:46,343
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm beautiful, dammit.

1196
01:05:46,844 --> 01:05:49,287
[SPEAKER_02]: You definitely lit the stage.

1197
01:05:51,471 --> 01:05:52,672
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm gonna set this stage on fire.

1198
01:05:53,212 --> 01:05:54,513
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep, it was flaming all night.

1199
01:05:56,655 --> 01:05:59,597
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, so, let's start off.

1200
01:06:00,718 --> 01:06:02,579
[SPEAKER_15]: Just one second, we're gonna get to... We need our theme song.

1201
01:06:02,639 --> 01:06:03,620
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, here's the theme song.

1202
01:06:04,480 --> 01:06:07,342
[SPEAKER_15]: Which, if you were paying attention, you know is Jamie's favorite tax song.

1203
01:06:07,462 --> 01:06:08,183
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm now wet.

1204
01:06:08,323 --> 01:06:12,066
[SPEAKER_15]: Last week in the Orange Lounge Cage Match, for the second week in a row...

1205
01:06:14,491 --> 01:06:16,132
[SPEAKER_15]: Vincent Damore won it with Eternity.

1206
01:06:16,172 --> 01:06:18,733
[SPEAKER_15]: So this is the first song you can vote for in tonight's cage match.

1207
01:06:18,773 --> 01:06:23,115
[SPEAKER_15]: By the way, if you're new to this, you join our chatroom, you send me tonight.

1208
01:06:23,155 --> 01:06:25,056
[SPEAKER_15]: My name is Sky Chatroom Slut.

1209
01:06:25,356 --> 01:06:27,697
[SPEAKER_15]: Or you can email them to OrangeLoungeRadio at Yahoo.com.

1210
01:06:28,337 --> 01:06:30,939
[SPEAKER_15]: Email the song you like best out of the three you hear.

1211
01:06:31,279 --> 01:06:35,000
[SPEAKER_15]: We don't accept votes until the end of the third song when I say send votes.

1212
01:06:35,981 --> 01:06:39,442
[SPEAKER_15]: And the winner gets put into Orange Lounge rotation for the whole week.

1213
01:06:39,582 --> 01:06:41,703
[SPEAKER_15]: And this song has been in for two weeks now.

1214
01:06:41,864 --> 01:06:42,724
[SPEAKER_15]: Looking for its third week.

1215
01:06:43,044 --> 01:06:44,346
[SPEAKER_18]: This is the second time this has happened to me.

1216
01:07:13,345 --> 01:07:15,757
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, Jamie's requesting I play a certain part of this song, hold on.

1217
01:07:53,491 --> 01:07:55,272
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright, that's song number one you can vote for.

1218
01:07:55,312 --> 01:07:57,553
[SPEAKER_15]: That's Vincent Damore with Eternity.

1219
01:07:58,373 --> 01:08:00,914
[SPEAKER_15]: Now, I noticed Loki's got something.

1220
01:08:00,954 --> 01:08:02,435
[SPEAKER_15]: He's trying very hard this week.

1221
01:08:02,455 --> 01:08:04,336
[SPEAKER_15]: He might do it to throw in Eternity.

1222
01:08:04,436 --> 01:08:06,357
[SPEAKER_15]: If any song's going to do it, it's going to be this one.

1223
01:08:06,637 --> 01:08:08,177
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't even know why I'm going to bother tonight.

1224
01:08:08,718 --> 01:08:09,998
[SPEAKER_17]: But, Loki, read it out.

1225
01:08:10,378 --> 01:08:12,839
[SPEAKER_17]: Alright, this one's a brand new track.

1226
01:08:13,340 --> 01:08:16,641
[SPEAKER_17]: Loki vs. ZZ featuring Sun Decade.

1227
01:08:16,661 --> 01:08:20,803
[SPEAKER_17]: This is the debut of the finished version of The Legend of Trance.

1228
01:08:21,344 --> 01:08:24,100
[SPEAKER_15]: Here it is, the Legend of Trance, Loki's cage match pick tonight.

1229
01:11:10,339 --> 01:11:17,963
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright, that was Loki himself versus ZZ featuring Sun Decade with the Legend of Trance.

1230
01:11:18,823 --> 01:11:19,964
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, what did you guys think of it?

1231
01:11:21,004 --> 01:11:21,284
[SPEAKER_15]: Jamie?

1232
01:11:21,324 --> 01:11:24,466
[SPEAKER_15]: That was pretty good.

1233
01:11:26,567 --> 01:11:29,689
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, you're looking very pleased with yourself.

1234
01:11:29,829 --> 01:11:30,889
[SPEAKER_17]: Of course, I made it.

1235
01:11:31,089 --> 01:11:32,690
[SPEAKER_18]: You're looking giddy.

1236
01:11:33,671 --> 01:11:35,091
[SPEAKER_17]: I like that song.

1237
01:11:35,852 --> 01:11:36,392
[SPEAKER_18]: Get a nine.

1238
01:11:40,428 --> 01:11:41,389
[SPEAKER_18]: Are we on?

1239
01:11:41,409 --> 01:11:42,169
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, we're on.

1240
01:11:42,189 --> 01:11:42,469
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway.

1241
01:11:42,509 --> 01:11:43,770
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, you get nine.

1242
01:11:45,891 --> 01:11:46,272
[SPEAKER_12]: Alrighty.

1243
01:11:46,632 --> 01:11:46,912
[SPEAKER_12]: Zero.

1244
01:11:48,733 --> 01:11:52,955
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, like, I actually had a chance to listen to it last night on the way the views are.

1245
01:11:53,035 --> 01:11:55,197
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, I definitely give it a nine.

1246
01:11:55,257 --> 01:11:56,497
[SPEAKER_16]: It was a great song.

1247
01:11:56,918 --> 01:11:59,179
[SPEAKER_16]: It was a great song.

1248
01:12:00,100 --> 01:12:01,020
[SPEAKER_15]: Loki, what'd you think?

1249
01:12:02,921 --> 01:12:03,642
[SPEAKER_15]: Dare I ask?

1250
01:12:04,202 --> 01:12:04,942
[SPEAKER_17]: He gives himself a 69.

1251
01:12:05,102 --> 01:12:07,624
[SPEAKER_17]: I like it.

1252
01:12:07,984 --> 01:12:09,365
[SPEAKER_17]: I, you know...

1253
01:12:10,322 --> 01:12:12,506
[SPEAKER_17]: It can always be better, but yeah, 9.

1254
01:12:12,566 --> 01:12:13,848
[SPEAKER_17]: Find a 10, because I can!

1255
01:12:14,489 --> 01:12:14,790
[SPEAKER_17]: Alright.

1256
01:12:19,657 --> 01:12:21,879
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm sure he doesn't have a big ego now.

1257
01:12:21,899 --> 01:12:24,062
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, it was very well done.

1258
01:12:24,282 --> 01:12:25,163
[SPEAKER_12]: I give it a nine.

1259
01:12:25,243 --> 01:12:27,585
[SPEAKER_15]: Ooh, nines across the board so far.

1260
01:12:28,006 --> 01:12:28,426
[SPEAKER_17]: Brad?

1261
01:12:28,646 --> 01:12:30,888
[SPEAKER_17]: I think the earlier version of it gets a nine.

1262
01:12:30,908 --> 01:12:32,070
[SPEAKER_14]: This, he cleaned it up.

1263
01:12:32,090 --> 01:12:32,890
[SPEAKER_14]: This gets a ten.

1264
01:12:33,871 --> 01:12:35,153
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, a ten from Brad.

1265
01:12:35,173 --> 01:12:36,014
[SPEAKER_15]: Wait, wait, wait.

1266
01:12:36,034 --> 01:12:36,874
[SPEAKER_15]: For the Legend of Trance.

1267
01:12:36,894 --> 01:12:37,235
[SPEAKER_15]: Never mind.

1268
01:12:37,415 --> 01:12:37,935
[SPEAKER_15]: It was crap.

1269
01:12:37,995 --> 01:12:38,736
[SPEAKER_15]: I give it a zero.

1270
01:12:40,018 --> 01:12:41,999
[SPEAKER_15]: All right, um, Loki, what...

1271
01:12:42,800 --> 01:12:43,841
[SPEAKER_15]: What can I say, Loki?

1272
01:12:44,561 --> 01:12:49,324
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm your biggest fanboy, but I'm not going to inflate your ego by giving you a 10, so you get a 9.9.

1273
01:12:49,725 --> 01:12:52,827
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, damn.

1274
01:12:52,887 --> 01:12:53,747
[SPEAKER_15]: So he gets a 9.9.

1275
01:12:54,868 --> 01:12:55,228
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

1276
01:12:56,549 --> 01:13:01,192
[SPEAKER_15]: So, there is your first two songs, Eternity from Vincent D'Amore and Loki with the Legend of Trance.

1277
01:13:01,972 --> 01:13:09,177
[SPEAKER_15]: I've decided, since both of those two are very kick-ass songs, there's no way in fucking hell I was going to win with my original pick, so I'm going for Broke.

1278
01:13:10,990 --> 01:13:12,372
[SPEAKER_15]: Forget this trance stuff.

1279
01:13:13,012 --> 01:13:15,054
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm just gonna play something that's fucking cool.

1280
01:13:16,076 --> 01:13:19,960
[SPEAKER_15]: So my pick for tonight's cage match comes from a little movie you may or may not have heard of.

1281
01:13:20,500 --> 01:13:22,803
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a musical, because everybody loves musicals.

1282
01:13:24,051 --> 01:13:28,375
[SPEAKER_15]: It's from a little story about a boy who's a girl.

1283
01:13:30,997 --> 01:13:32,739
[SPEAKER_15]: And it's called Hedwig and the Angry Inch.

1284
01:13:32,839 --> 01:13:39,084
[SPEAKER_15]: So my pick for tonight's cage match is Angry Inch from the movie Hedwig and the Angry Inch.

1285
01:13:39,144 --> 01:13:39,605
[SPEAKER_15]: And you know what?

1286
01:13:39,625 --> 01:13:41,887
[SPEAKER_15]: This song really would make a kick-ass guitar freak song.

1287
01:13:41,987 --> 01:13:43,668
[SPEAKER_15]: So, fuck you!

1288
01:13:43,828 --> 01:13:44,649
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright, enjoy.

1289
01:13:44,929 --> 01:13:46,851
[SPEAKER_15]: This is Hedwig and the Angry Inch.

1290
01:13:46,931 --> 01:13:47,551
[SPEAKER_09]: Angry Inch.

1291
01:13:49,253 --> 01:13:51,575
[SPEAKER_09]: One must give up a little part of oneself.

1292
01:15:09,955 --> 01:15:11,099
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks for watching!

1293
01:15:39,085 --> 01:16:06,968
[SPEAKER_10]: When I woke up from the operation, I was bleeding down there I was bleeding from the gash between my legs It was my first day as a woman, already that time of the month Two days later the hole closed out, you know The wound healed and I was left with a one inch mound of flesh Where my penis used to be, where my vagina never was, it was a one

1294
01:16:13,115 --> 01:16:37,275
[SPEAKER_10]: And I left space It was just a little buzz, there was nothing I could hear Six inches forward, five inches back The train is coming and I'm tired of the track I try to get along but I can't get no slack I got one here and here, and here and here And I got an active four, five inches back Stay on the job until the night turns to night I got my inch, I'm set to attack

1295
01:16:54,430 --> 01:16:56,672
[SPEAKER_15]: We got a lot of dots from the chat room.

1296
01:16:57,432 --> 01:17:00,915
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, how do we get the Angry Inch with Angry Inch?

1297
01:17:01,195 --> 01:17:02,916
[SPEAKER_05]: Jamie gives it a 10.

1298
01:17:04,598 --> 01:17:05,739
[SPEAKER_15]: Loki, it's 0.

1299
01:17:05,779 --> 01:17:09,662
[SPEAKER_16]: She just wants to give it a 10 so her song works again.

1300
01:17:10,262 --> 01:17:11,483
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know about that.

1301
01:17:11,603 --> 01:17:12,604
[SPEAKER_16]: I guess I'll give it like...

1302
01:17:13,923 --> 01:17:16,426
[SPEAKER_16]: It was funny as hell, but I don't know.

1303
01:17:17,987 --> 01:17:23,593
[SPEAKER_16]: I will see the movie one day and then I'll give it something higher maybe.

1304
01:17:23,733 --> 01:17:26,196
[SPEAKER_12]: I give it an 8 because it had colorful lyrics.

1305
01:17:26,276 --> 01:17:26,876
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I give it an 8.

1306
01:17:31,551 --> 01:17:36,098
[SPEAKER_15]: I would actually go to Roseville Golf Line and play that for when the parents bring their little children home.

1307
01:17:45,652 --> 01:17:54,676
[SPEAKER_02]: You may start sending in your votes now to myself in the chatroom, Sky Chatroom Slut, or you can send those over email to orangebossradio at yahoo.com.

1308
01:17:54,696 --> 01:17:55,976
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's review, shall we, really quickly.

1309
01:18:14,053 --> 01:18:16,075
[SPEAKER_15]: Choice number one, Eternity by Vincent Damore.

1310
01:18:16,095 --> 01:18:20,639
[SPEAKER_15]: Choice number two, Loki with The Legend of Trance.

1311
01:18:41,897 --> 01:18:45,380
[SPEAKER_15]: Choice number three, Hedwig and the Angry Inch with Angry Inch.

1312
01:18:59,730 --> 01:19:01,331
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright, there they are.

1313
01:19:02,452 --> 01:19:03,033
[SPEAKER_15]: Vote now.

1314
01:19:03,353 --> 01:19:06,015
[SPEAKER_15]: We'll tally those votes up during the next break.

1315
01:19:07,876 --> 01:19:09,517
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, wow, that was a fun cage match.

1316
01:19:11,092 --> 01:19:15,315
[SPEAKER_15]: We had an old favorite trance song, a new favorite trance song, and an anti-trance song.

1317
01:19:16,996 --> 01:19:17,576
[SPEAKER_02]: Anti-trance.

1318
01:19:17,616 --> 01:19:18,877
[SPEAKER_15]: Good, good, good cage match.

1319
01:19:18,937 --> 01:19:19,217
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright.

1320
01:19:20,158 --> 01:19:21,259
[SPEAKER_15]: So, what else is up?

1321
01:19:21,279 --> 01:19:22,579
[SPEAKER_02]: I need to do my request of the week.

1322
01:19:22,960 --> 01:19:24,140
[SPEAKER_02]: You need to do your request of the week.

1323
01:19:24,201 --> 01:19:30,825
[SPEAKER_02]: For any aspiring person who wants to make a mix of anything, I want the Safari trance mix.

1324
01:19:31,685 --> 01:19:33,146
[SPEAKER_15]: You want a trance mix of the Safari?

1325
01:19:33,166 --> 01:19:34,347
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, my request is still out there.

1326
01:19:34,807 --> 01:19:37,189
[SPEAKER_15]: I played the Safari today and I failed very badly.

1327
01:19:37,694 --> 01:19:38,837
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to play the Safari during the break.

1328
01:19:39,078 --> 01:19:40,962
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, we'll play Safari during the break.

1329
01:19:41,644 --> 01:19:45,895
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember, for whoever makes this for me, I'm going to reward you in some form or fashion if it's cool.

1330
01:19:48,338 --> 01:19:52,520
[SPEAKER_15]: Dark Tetsuya was reminding me of something I need to play for y'all just to get what your thoughts are on this.

1331
01:19:52,800 --> 01:19:53,380
[SPEAKER_15]: For y'all.

1332
01:19:54,221 --> 01:19:55,621
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought I was the southern chick here.

1333
01:19:57,442 --> 01:19:59,403
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm just a southern bale in a boy's body.

1334
01:20:00,464 --> 01:20:00,824
[SPEAKER_15]: Just kidding.

1335
01:20:00,864 --> 01:20:03,365
[SPEAKER_02]: I can get you one of those trail maid dresses.

1336
01:20:04,205 --> 01:20:07,307
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm being told that this is a clip from a new song in Poppin' Music 9.

1337
01:20:08,347 --> 01:20:10,408
[SPEAKER_15]: Tell me if this sounds a little familiar to you guys.

1338
01:21:05,833 --> 01:21:07,494
[SPEAKER_15]: All right, that's the clip we got.

1339
01:21:07,514 --> 01:21:09,514
[SPEAKER_15]: Dude, I would play that in Drum Mania.

1340
01:21:09,914 --> 01:21:12,335
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know the story behind that, where that came from.

1341
01:21:12,395 --> 01:21:14,116
[SPEAKER_15]: I guess I'm being told it's Poppin' Music 9.

1342
01:21:14,236 --> 01:21:17,477
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know enough about Poppin' Music to know if that's true or not.

1343
01:21:18,437 --> 01:21:21,278
[SPEAKER_02]: Check the Japanese site, the music list.

1344
01:21:21,738 --> 01:21:26,480
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, from what I remember, the original URL that was posted from was from Bomani Cell.

1345
01:21:27,240 --> 01:21:27,760
[SPEAKER_15]: Ah, all right.

1346
01:21:28,880 --> 01:21:31,361
[SPEAKER_15]: So, yeah, Guitar Freaks version.

1347
01:21:31,401 --> 01:21:32,322
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know about Poppin' Music.

1348
01:21:32,362 --> 01:21:33,682
[SPEAKER_15]: Sounds more Guitar Freaks to me, but whatever.

1349
01:21:34,912 --> 01:21:37,693
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, you have Dyke and Ty, I mean, from, uh... True.

1350
01:21:37,833 --> 01:21:38,333
[SPEAKER_17]: True.

1351
01:21:38,433 --> 01:21:41,374
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, that's... Yeah.

1352
01:21:41,414 --> 01:21:45,195
[SPEAKER_02]: The freaking Cutie Honey theme song in pop music.

1353
01:21:46,255 --> 01:21:49,816
[SPEAKER_15]: It's labeled as not as absolute as... It's labeled as avatage.

1354
01:21:50,776 --> 01:21:51,076
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.

1355
01:21:51,636 --> 01:21:51,956
[SPEAKER_15]: Whatever.

1356
01:21:55,557 --> 01:21:56,397
[SPEAKER_17]: That's what they had on there.

1357
01:21:56,417 --> 01:22:02,879
[SPEAKER_17]: They were talking about, like, if they were to make lyrics for it, like, if we drink a real in for a hot limit, it was Icy Frozen Lightning Bolt.

1358
01:22:05,928 --> 01:22:08,969
[SPEAKER_15]: I have very few votes registered in right now for the cage match.

1359
01:22:09,009 --> 01:22:09,990
[SPEAKER_15]: I hope you all are voting.

1360
01:22:10,970 --> 01:22:12,531
[SPEAKER_15]: Send those in, or we'll kill you.

1361
01:22:13,471 --> 01:22:14,952
[SPEAKER_17]: Vote or you get kicked.

1362
01:22:15,012 --> 01:22:17,433
[SPEAKER_15]: Vote or you, yeah, vote or you get kicked from the chat room.

1363
01:22:17,613 --> 01:22:18,133
[SPEAKER_15]: Just kidding.

1364
01:22:18,893 --> 01:22:20,114
[SPEAKER_02]: Or we slap you with a trout.

1365
01:22:20,214 --> 01:22:22,795
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright, no, but seriously, you guys only have a few more minutes to send votes.

1366
01:22:23,075 --> 01:22:24,715
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, I promised we would play this last break.

1367
01:22:24,735 --> 01:22:25,376
[SPEAKER_15]: We didn't get around to it.

1368
01:22:25,636 --> 01:22:26,736
[SPEAKER_15]: But this is a JB mix.

1369
01:22:26,756 --> 01:22:27,857
[SPEAKER_15]: We've heard something from Loki.

1370
01:22:28,117 --> 01:22:30,758
[SPEAKER_15]: One of our other regulars, JB, made a remix of...

1371
01:22:31,298 --> 01:22:31,838
[SPEAKER_15]: Guess what?

1372
01:22:31,879 --> 01:22:32,739
[SPEAKER_15]: A Jenny Rom song.

1373
01:22:32,759 --> 01:22:33,560
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh-oh.

1374
01:22:33,760 --> 01:22:34,660
[SPEAKER_15]: But you know what, JB?

1375
01:22:34,700 --> 01:22:35,301
[SPEAKER_02]: Hide the children.

1376
01:22:35,401 --> 01:22:39,744
[SPEAKER_15]: JB did some good shit with that Sega thing, the Sega CD BIOS music.

1377
01:22:39,804 --> 01:22:41,245
[SPEAKER_15]: So I'm actually looking forward to hearing this.

1378
01:22:41,285 --> 01:22:42,306
[SPEAKER_15]: I think this will be very cool.

1379
01:22:42,666 --> 01:22:45,488
[SPEAKER_15]: This is a remix of Jenny Rom with Do You Wanna Flirt?

1380
01:22:45,528 --> 01:22:47,850
[SPEAKER_15]: It's called the Modern Dub Remix, and I'm looking forward to hearing it.

1381
01:22:48,270 --> 01:22:49,090
[SPEAKER_15]: And you should, too.

1382
01:22:49,110 --> 01:22:50,451
[SPEAKER_15]: This is a remix by JB in our chatroom.

1383
01:22:51,132 --> 01:22:52,413
[SPEAKER_15]: Here we go, Orange Lounge Radio.

1384
01:26:48,288 --> 01:26:52,752
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright, my apologies to JB because that's the modem mix.

1385
01:26:53,152 --> 01:26:54,914
[SPEAKER_15]: Modem dub mix, not the modern dub mix.

1386
01:26:54,954 --> 01:26:55,594
[SPEAKER_15]: My bad.

1387
01:26:55,875 --> 01:26:56,255
[SPEAKER_15]: Jesus.

1388
01:26:56,635 --> 01:26:57,516
[SPEAKER_15]: So that's the modem dub mix.

1389
01:26:57,576 --> 01:26:57,956
[SPEAKER_15]: Nice job.

1390
01:26:58,097 --> 01:26:58,417
[SPEAKER_15]: Nice job.

1391
01:26:58,497 --> 01:26:59,117
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright, back to break.

1392
01:26:59,137 --> 01:26:59,498
[SPEAKER_15]: We'll be back.

1393
01:28:38,469 --> 01:28:39,296
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't turn me

1394
01:30:02,899 --> 01:30:03,988
Thanks for watching!

1395
01:30:39,253 --> 01:30:43,419
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's listen in on an Orange Lounge Radio staff meeting.

1396
01:30:43,640 --> 01:30:45,362
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you want to be accepted by Hollywood?

1397
01:30:45,402 --> 01:30:45,783
[SPEAKER_10]: No!

1398
01:30:48,166 --> 01:30:49,528
[SPEAKER_07]: Do we care what people think of us?

1399
01:30:50,149 --> 01:30:52,011
[SPEAKER_07]: No!

1400
01:30:52,031 --> 01:30:53,474
[SPEAKER_07]: Do we want people to kiss our ass?

1401
01:30:53,934 --> 01:30:54,795
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes!

1402
01:30:57,990 --> 01:30:59,891
[SPEAKER_01]: Extreme Bobani Radio.

1403
01:31:00,071 --> 01:31:00,711
[SPEAKER_01]: That's us.

1404
01:31:01,252 --> 01:31:03,013
[SPEAKER_01]: Orange Lounge Radio.

1405
01:31:03,213 --> 01:31:05,034
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I love it when people kiss my ass.

1406
01:31:05,054 --> 01:31:05,174
No!

1407
01:31:05,794 --> 01:31:06,574
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah!

1408
01:31:07,215 --> 01:31:07,955
[SPEAKER_15]: Sounds like rejected.

1409
01:31:08,015 --> 01:31:09,436
[SPEAKER_06]: I say we let him go!

1410
01:31:10,116 --> 01:31:11,797
[SPEAKER_06]: No!

1411
01:31:12,037 --> 01:31:13,238
[SPEAKER_15]: Best movie ever.

1412
01:31:14,978 --> 01:31:17,700
[SPEAKER_15]: Pee-wee's Big Adventure, when he gets kidnapped by the bikers.

1413
01:31:18,780 --> 01:31:19,881
[SPEAKER_15]: Did you know that that's Elvira?

1414
01:31:20,581 --> 01:31:26,364
[SPEAKER_15]: The female one that grabs him by the neck and goes, I don't remember what she's... That's Elvira, the chick.

1415
01:31:28,154 --> 01:31:29,155
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, next time, pay attention!

1416
01:31:56,977 --> 01:31:59,079
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, you slapped somebody with a trout.

1417
01:31:59,299 --> 01:31:59,499
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1418
01:31:59,659 --> 01:32:00,040
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, I see.

1419
01:32:00,420 --> 01:32:02,101
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, you made me slap somebody.

1420
01:32:02,381 --> 01:32:02,862
[SPEAKER_15]: Ha ha!

1421
01:32:03,262 --> 01:32:03,542
[SPEAKER_15]: Whatever.

1422
01:32:04,163 --> 01:32:04,503
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright.

1423
01:32:05,704 --> 01:32:05,844
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh.

1424
01:32:06,344 --> 01:32:07,625
[SPEAKER_15]: Now the whole chat room is joining in.

1425
01:32:07,665 --> 01:32:07,946
[SPEAKER_15]: Great.

1426
01:32:08,446 --> 01:32:09,507
[SPEAKER_02]: I should start trends.

1427
01:32:10,448 --> 01:32:11,268
[SPEAKER_02]: You're such a trendsetter.

1428
01:32:11,288 --> 01:32:12,009
[SPEAKER_02]: Be like me!

1429
01:32:12,810 --> 01:32:13,930
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, let's see.

1430
01:32:14,271 --> 01:32:15,331
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, yes, the cage match.

1431
01:32:16,132 --> 01:32:22,917
[SPEAKER_15]: The winner of the cage match tonight was absolutely no contest whatsoever.

1432
01:32:23,118 --> 01:32:23,938
[SPEAKER_15]: Why sure ever?

1433
01:32:23,978 --> 01:32:24,719
[SPEAKER_15]: Why sure ever.

1434
01:32:24,999 --> 01:32:26,020
[SPEAKER_15]: Why don't you announce it, Jamie?

1435
01:32:29,509 --> 01:32:30,850
[SPEAKER_02]: The Winner is the Great Space Coaster

1436
01:32:56,917 --> 01:33:01,161
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright, so Legend of Trance wins this week's cage match, and we'll probably win for the next four weeks.

1437
01:33:01,181 --> 01:33:02,682
[SPEAKER_02]: Who needs someone to do Legend of Cumshot next?

1438
01:33:03,703 --> 01:33:08,667
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, we need somebody to make one of those erotic... Well, uh... Get some porn noises.

1439
01:33:11,209 --> 01:33:13,771
[SPEAKER_15]: I got porn, I could rip audio from that, I suppose.

1440
01:33:14,491 --> 01:33:15,212
[SPEAKER_15]: I suppose.

1441
01:33:15,772 --> 01:33:17,013
[SPEAKER_15]: I got some gay porn in the other room.

1442
01:33:17,314 --> 01:33:18,695
[SPEAKER_15]: Lots of Cumshots and gay porn.

1443
01:33:19,596 --> 01:33:20,396
[SPEAKER_15]: Jamie's all, you do?

1444
01:33:21,657 --> 01:33:23,058
[SPEAKER_15]: Just kidding, I actually only have one.

1445
01:33:23,499 --> 01:33:24,860
[SPEAKER_15]: Irene bought it for me for my birthday.

1446
01:33:26,181 --> 01:33:34,263
[SPEAKER_17]: I can just say it now, instead of like, the fly, you know, and like, the birth, it's like, ooh.

1447
01:33:34,403 --> 01:33:40,024
[SPEAKER_15]: You know what, they've been wanting a Skies voice remix, so I can do my voice, I can go, it flies.

1448
01:33:41,984 --> 01:33:42,644
[SPEAKER_15]: The sticky.

1449
01:33:42,784 --> 01:33:43,525
[SPEAKER_11]: Cream of some young guy.

1450
01:33:51,073 --> 01:33:51,954
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, we'll work on that.

1451
01:33:51,994 --> 01:33:53,775
[SPEAKER_15]: We'll work on Legend of Kumshock for you guys.

1452
01:33:54,276 --> 01:33:57,839
[SPEAKER_17]: And then when it's all fear, it's like, Ugh!

1453
01:33:58,179 --> 01:33:58,719
[SPEAKER_15]: Queer!

1454
01:33:59,980 --> 01:34:00,501
[SPEAKER_17]: Queer!

1455
01:34:03,123 --> 01:34:03,603
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

1456
01:34:04,524 --> 01:34:05,185
[SPEAKER_15]: We'll work on that.

1457
01:34:05,785 --> 01:34:07,587
[SPEAKER_15]: It'll be a present for our loyal listeners.

1458
01:34:08,542 --> 01:34:11,423
[SPEAKER_17]: I almost memorized the whole lyrics for a superstar.

1459
01:34:11,883 --> 01:34:12,163
[SPEAKER_17]: Why?

1460
01:34:12,743 --> 01:34:16,005
[SPEAKER_17]: Because I was going to do a rap and went... Okay, this really sucks.

1461
01:34:16,265 --> 01:34:20,506
[SPEAKER_17]: I was going to do a rap, okay, and they wanted... They had this thing for my work.

1462
01:34:20,586 --> 01:34:22,687
[SPEAKER_17]: It's a promo thing because we're promoting 8 Mile.

1463
01:34:23,987 --> 01:34:28,530
[SPEAKER_17]: and, um, they were doing this, like, wrap-off thing, and it was so you could win $100.

1464
01:34:28,570 --> 01:34:30,811
[SPEAKER_15]: I think you actually told us this story two weeks ago, but that's okay, tell us again.

1465
01:34:30,831 --> 01:34:42,797
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, anyway, so I was gonna do that, and so I memorized, you know, most, I got Superstar, but I ended up not doing it, and a lot of our company people did it, but they made their own wraps for, um, like, our work stuff.

1466
01:34:43,337 --> 01:34:43,717
[SPEAKER_17]: Whatever.

1467
01:34:43,777 --> 01:34:47,478
[SPEAKER_17]: But this one guy did it out of the blue.

1468
01:34:47,518 --> 01:34:49,979
[SPEAKER_17]: He just came up with it right on the spot.

1469
01:34:49,999 --> 01:34:50,700
[SPEAKER_17]: That was kind of cool.

1470
01:34:51,040 --> 01:34:56,842
[SPEAKER_17]: But instead of having the contest be where you could win $100, everyone that did it got $100.

1471
01:34:56,882 --> 01:34:59,723
[SPEAKER_17]: But not me because I didn't do it.

1472
01:34:59,783 --> 01:34:59,983
[SPEAKER_14]: Don't!

1473
01:35:02,313 --> 01:35:02,613
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, well.

1474
01:35:03,594 --> 01:35:04,075
[SPEAKER_14]: That sucks.

1475
01:35:05,397 --> 01:35:06,538
[SPEAKER_14]: What else do we have to talk about?

1476
01:35:06,698 --> 01:35:10,423
[SPEAKER_15]: I had something that I wanted to ask or talk about and I totally forgot.

1477
01:35:10,443 --> 01:35:11,024
[SPEAKER_15]: It slipped my mind.

1478
01:35:11,484 --> 01:35:11,785
[SPEAKER_15]: Damn!

1479
01:35:11,805 --> 01:35:12,646
[SPEAKER_15]: I hate that.

1480
01:35:12,846 --> 01:35:13,407
[SPEAKER_15]: Bad radio.

1481
01:35:13,467 --> 01:35:13,787
[SPEAKER_14]: Damn!

1482
01:35:13,807 --> 01:35:14,928
[SPEAKER_15]: I need to write this shit down.

1483
01:35:15,689 --> 01:35:16,771
[SPEAKER_15]: That's too much work, though.

1484
01:35:17,728 --> 01:35:19,790
[SPEAKER_15]: That's more effort than I desire to put into this show.

1485
01:35:20,210 --> 01:35:24,934
[SPEAKER_15]: As Jamie files for nails.

1486
01:35:26,096 --> 01:35:26,596
[SPEAKER_15]: FUs of the week?

1487
01:35:26,616 --> 01:35:28,277
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, why don't we just get to the FUs of the week?

1488
01:35:28,297 --> 01:35:28,638
[SPEAKER_15]: Why not?

1489
01:35:29,018 --> 01:35:29,899
[SPEAKER_15]: How's that sound to you, Jamie?

1490
01:35:30,499 --> 01:35:31,080
[SPEAKER_15]: Jamie's nodding.

1491
01:35:32,021 --> 01:35:33,482
[SPEAKER_15]: She's got some angsty things she wants to say.

1492
01:35:34,043 --> 01:35:41,029
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, we've been getting advice from some people because the FUs always seem to go on for a long time that we ought to cut back the FUs of the week to like once a month or something.

1493
01:35:41,269 --> 01:35:43,191
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, then they wouldn't be the FUs of the week, now would they?

1494
01:35:43,611 --> 01:35:45,272
[SPEAKER_15]: Then how long would you think that would be?

1495
01:35:45,572 --> 01:35:47,614
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, that would be a whole month's worth of it.

1496
01:35:47,654 --> 01:35:48,775
[SPEAKER_15]: We'd have to do a whole show.

1497
01:35:49,215 --> 01:35:51,937
[SPEAKER_15]: We'd have to have, okay, last Sunday of each month is the FU show.

1498
01:35:52,198 --> 01:35:57,802
[SPEAKER_17]: I promise to cut back on the repeat FUs for drivers and stuff.

1499
01:35:57,822 --> 01:36:00,664
[SPEAKER_17]: We know that they suck all year round, and there's nothing going to change there.

1500
01:36:01,925 --> 01:36:06,509
[SPEAKER_15]: So, you know, maybe we'd have to just instate quotas on the chatroom FUs.

1501
01:36:09,005 --> 01:36:10,765
[SPEAKER_15]: So we'll punish you people that bitch.

1502
01:36:12,026 --> 01:36:12,526
[SPEAKER_15]: That's right.

1503
01:36:13,686 --> 01:36:14,386
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, you don't get any.

1504
01:36:14,426 --> 01:36:17,887
[SPEAKER_17]: Come on the show and you get to be angsty as much as you want.

1505
01:36:19,027 --> 01:36:21,288
[SPEAKER_15]: So, but for tonight, no, we're just teasing.

1506
01:36:21,308 --> 01:36:22,468
[SPEAKER_15]: We're giving you guys a hard time.

1507
01:36:22,928 --> 01:36:24,669
[SPEAKER_15]: We'll do the FUs like we always do.

1508
01:36:24,809 --> 01:36:27,089
[SPEAKER_15]: So, send us those FUs to me.

1509
01:36:27,709 --> 01:36:28,210
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm Sky.

1510
01:36:28,250 --> 01:36:29,210
[SPEAKER_15]: Am I still chatroom slut?

1511
01:36:29,230 --> 01:36:29,670
[SPEAKER_15]: I think I am.

1512
01:36:29,930 --> 01:36:33,471
[SPEAKER_15]: So send those over private message to Sky chatroom slut.

1513
01:36:33,551 --> 01:36:34,851
[SPEAKER_15]: Jamie, terror or original?

1514
01:36:35,191 --> 01:36:35,931
[SPEAKER_15]: Terror.

1515
01:36:35,991 --> 01:36:36,772
[SPEAKER_15]: Terror.

1516
01:36:36,912 --> 01:36:38,352
[SPEAKER_15]: Cause you're terrifying.

1517
01:36:38,772 --> 01:36:39,773
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I had to let it start.

1518
01:36:40,453 --> 01:36:42,695
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, here we go, FU's the week, you know it, you love it.

1519
01:36:45,137 --> 01:36:45,777
This is fucked up.

1520
01:36:45,797 --> 01:36:46,377
Okay, my FU's the week.

1521
01:36:46,397 --> 01:36:48,039
First of all, I'm sorry, I think he's moving his leg.

1522
01:36:48,119 --> 01:36:53,482
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, my first one gets more drivers, because it's not, oh shit, it's not moving his legs.

1523
01:37:03,415 --> 01:37:04,776
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry, Matt Hedlund on the back.

1524
01:37:05,337 --> 01:37:06,818
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, yeah, bad drivers.

1525
01:37:07,218 --> 01:37:09,439
[SPEAKER_02]: Especially old people drivers who tailgate.

1526
01:37:10,760 --> 01:37:11,161
[SPEAKER_02]: I hate them.

1527
01:37:11,321 --> 01:37:11,601
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway.

1528
01:37:12,341 --> 01:37:17,285
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, the next one goes, uh, to, uh, Sack of Imani.

1529
01:37:18,085 --> 01:37:18,886
[SPEAKER_02]: To our server.

1530
01:37:19,506 --> 01:37:20,547
[SPEAKER_02]: That always goes down.

1531
01:37:21,368 --> 01:37:21,988
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're moving.

1532
01:37:22,949 --> 01:37:23,469
[SPEAKER_06]: Eventually.

1533
01:37:23,529 --> 01:37:23,709
[SPEAKER_06]: Right?

1534
01:37:24,210 --> 01:37:24,450
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

1535
01:37:24,470 --> 01:37:26,031
[SPEAKER_14]: As soon as we possibly can.

1536
01:37:27,404 --> 01:37:31,606
[SPEAKER_02]: So, $1hosting.com gets the big finger of the year.

1537
01:37:31,746 --> 01:37:33,147
[SPEAKER_18]: They're actually good enough.

1538
01:37:33,167 --> 01:37:34,587
[SPEAKER_15]: Them and their stupid pirates, Ark.

1539
01:37:35,088 --> 01:37:35,648
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, Ark.

1540
01:37:35,868 --> 01:37:41,891
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, and I've been listening to you for this in Buffy for two weeks, but you stayed before me, right?

1541
01:37:42,491 --> 01:37:42,771
[SPEAKER_15]: I did.

1542
01:37:42,811 --> 01:37:45,352
[SPEAKER_15]: I hope, hopefully my roommates didn't believe me.

1543
01:37:45,372 --> 01:37:46,473
[SPEAKER_02]: Yay, back on.

1544
01:37:47,113 --> 01:37:52,195
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, another one goes toward me for ignoring my Animal Crossing village and my villagers moving out of me.

1545
01:37:52,215 --> 01:37:52,956
[SPEAKER_02]: But they still love me.

1546
01:37:54,382 --> 01:37:55,643
[SPEAKER_18]: I got Camo Frog.

1547
01:37:55,663 --> 01:37:56,243
[SPEAKER_18]: You got Cube.

1548
01:37:56,263 --> 01:37:56,743
[SPEAKER_18]: Cube's rare.

1549
01:37:56,763 --> 01:37:57,484
[SPEAKER_18]: Cube's a penguin.

1550
01:37:57,504 --> 01:37:57,924
[SPEAKER_18]: What's Cube?

1551
01:37:57,944 --> 01:37:58,284
[SPEAKER_18]: Penguin!

1552
01:37:58,344 --> 01:38:01,406
[SPEAKER_18]: It's an Animal Crossing.

1553
01:38:01,426 --> 01:38:02,766
[SPEAKER_18]: We're still talking Animal Crossing.

1554
01:38:18,869 --> 01:38:25,394
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I had another one, oh yeah, another one goes toward last night, me being really sick and out of it and not eating anything.

1555
01:38:26,756 --> 01:38:33,961
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, another one goes toward just about every store in this town except for this one ghetto mart in Trader Joe's for not having orange juice.

1556
01:38:35,162 --> 01:38:38,885
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, another one goes toward oatmeal cream pies for being an addictive food item.

1557
01:38:40,427 --> 01:38:42,989
[SPEAKER_02]: And then one goes toward Walgreens for not having peach propel.

1558
01:38:43,649 --> 01:38:45,711
[SPEAKER_02]: But however, they did have propel, but I wouldn't get one for you.

1559
01:38:48,301 --> 01:38:53,243
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, another one goes toward a lot of stores in town for not selling balls, because I like blue balls.

1560
01:38:54,503 --> 01:39:00,225
[SPEAKER_18]: And, um, another one is going toward, um, my box for being too big.

1561
01:39:00,245 --> 01:39:04,787
[SPEAKER_18]: Because I got my slip in my shoe and it really makes me dry.

1562
01:39:05,727 --> 01:39:09,148
[SPEAKER_02]: And my big FD of the week goes toward JList.com.

1563
01:39:10,108 --> 01:39:14,910
[SPEAKER_02]: I put in my order a month ago for loose socks and Bacari Sweat in soft blue.

1564
01:39:16,286 --> 01:39:16,926
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you know what?

1565
01:39:17,107 --> 01:39:19,128
[SPEAKER_02]: It's still at night in my house yet!

1566
01:39:19,168 --> 01:39:20,809
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, uh, F.U.

1567
01:39:20,849 --> 01:39:27,052
[SPEAKER_18]: goes on tour on my Jungle with Taka for the album, and uh, making me spend money.

1568
01:39:27,632 --> 01:39:34,016
[SPEAKER_18]: I bought, um, Mega Ranger vs. Car Ranger, on my Switch, and Mega Ranger vs. Ninja Ranger, on my Switch.

1569
01:39:34,996 --> 01:39:35,897
[SPEAKER_18]: And other F.U.

1570
01:39:35,917 --> 01:39:38,058
[SPEAKER_18]: discs, if you'd like them to play my TV series.

1571
01:39:38,298 --> 01:39:39,139
[SPEAKER_18]: And that's it.

1572
01:39:39,159 --> 01:39:42,260
[SPEAKER_17]: Did you say hentai TV series?

1573
01:39:42,560 --> 01:39:43,161
[SPEAKER_18]: It's hentai!

1574
01:39:46,054 --> 01:39:48,115
[SPEAKER_17]: You have special music tonight, Loki, am I correct?

1575
01:39:48,255 --> 01:39:53,476
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, special music, this goes for with my F.U.s.

1576
01:39:53,496 --> 01:39:54,596
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright!

1577
01:39:54,817 --> 01:39:58,518
[SPEAKER_17]: Most of these F.U.s come from last night.

1578
01:39:58,798 --> 01:39:59,138
F.U.

1579
01:39:59,718 --> 01:40:01,698
[SPEAKER_17]: to Vacaville, because you suck!

1580
01:40:01,718 --> 01:40:02,539
[SPEAKER_17]: F.U.

1581
01:40:02,559 --> 01:40:09,821
[SPEAKER_17]: the white trash that lives in Vacaville, I really hate you, I don't like you coming up and talking to me.

1582
01:40:11,381 --> 01:40:14,082
[SPEAKER_17]: One person in particular is a stupid cowboy...

1583
01:40:14,762 --> 01:40:15,342
[SPEAKER_17]: Skater.

1584
01:40:15,923 --> 01:40:17,864
[SPEAKER_17]: You can't mix those two genres together.

1585
01:40:17,904 --> 01:40:18,844
[SPEAKER_17]: It's like oil and water.

1586
01:40:19,124 --> 01:40:29,830
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, but this jackass comes up to us, starts talking to us, puts his hand... Okay, now, obviously this is going to be bad radio, but he goes up to the table and goes, hits the table and he's like, How you doing?

1587
01:40:29,850 --> 01:40:31,851
[SPEAKER_17]: And I'm like, Go away!

1588
01:40:32,912 --> 01:40:39,575
[SPEAKER_17]: And then he kept staying there and talking to us and got into a conversation with us and eventually we ended up bringing up the DDR solo thing.

1589
01:40:39,715 --> 01:40:42,757
[SPEAKER_17]: He's like, Uh, what's a syringe?

1590
01:40:44,429 --> 01:40:46,671
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, maybe if you weren't such a dumbass, you'd know what that is.

1591
01:40:48,172 --> 01:40:51,815
[SPEAKER_17]: Then... Oh, yeah.

1592
01:40:52,096 --> 01:40:53,357
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, what about Ecstasy?

1593
01:40:54,665 --> 01:40:55,666
[SPEAKER_16]: Then, he tried to hug Brian.

1594
01:40:55,886 --> 01:40:57,186
[SPEAKER_16]: Awww, he just wants a hug!

1595
01:41:20,020 --> 01:41:21,401
[SPEAKER_16]: He was trying to hug on everybody.

1596
01:41:21,421 --> 01:41:23,081
[SPEAKER_16]: He just had this problem.

1597
01:41:23,141 --> 01:41:24,682
[SPEAKER_16]: He said this one kid was his lover.

1598
01:41:24,722 --> 01:41:26,103
[SPEAKER_16]: He was like a 12 year old kid.

1599
01:41:27,483 --> 01:41:28,324
[SPEAKER_16]: You got a problem with that?

1600
01:41:28,484 --> 01:41:29,544
He was like 17 or 18, the kid was 12.

1601
01:41:29,604 --> 01:41:30,105
[SPEAKER_16]: It's like Michael Jackson.

1602
01:41:35,467 --> 01:41:38,249
[SPEAKER_02]: First of all, now you know the reason why I love this song.

1603
01:41:38,509 --> 01:41:45,973
[SPEAKER_17]: Alright, and, finally, FU2, their machine conditions at that arcade, they suck ass.

1604
01:41:46,293 --> 01:41:57,879
[SPEAKER_17]: DVR, the fifth mix, fucking all the arrows are broken, and Max 2, the arrows were set in about one quarter inch into the pads, so it's like, you can't play on that, it sucked.

1605
01:41:58,719 --> 01:42:02,782
[SPEAKER_17]: So that's like, their fucking soda machine is broken, okay?

1606
01:42:03,042 --> 01:42:05,364
[SPEAKER_17]: I wanted a fucking Sierra Mist and I got a Mountain Dew.

1607
01:42:06,104 --> 01:42:06,644
[SPEAKER_16]: What the hell?

1608
01:42:06,684 --> 01:42:07,945
[SPEAKER_16]: Then, then, to add that on top of...

1609
01:42:14,076 --> 01:42:40,824
[SPEAKER_17]: for all that, then we get to Cusar, okay, there's, the way they have that working out there, it totally sucks, they, the employees don't know what the fuck they're doing, employees aren't really working, they need to put people there, their briefing room's an empty room, they don't have half-day passes, empty room, not painted, empty room, they don't have half-day passes, they don't have half-day passes, they fucking suck, so, yeah, empty to them, um,

1610
01:42:42,515 --> 01:42:53,526
[SPEAKER_17]: That's pretty much it, that's all I had, you know, I really was trying to come up with a huge list, I had a bunch of stuff last night, but after a while at QZAR, we had some people come talk to us, they were really nice, and they made me less angsty, so that was cool.

1611
01:42:53,546 --> 01:42:54,407
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, he was tech.

1612
01:42:54,447 --> 01:42:57,530
[SPEAKER_08]: That's it, I'm not too angsty at the moment, if anything comes to me later, I'll take it then.

1613
01:42:57,550 --> 01:42:57,931
[SPEAKER_08]: That's it.

1614
01:43:08,243 --> 01:43:08,683
[SPEAKER_15]: My turn.

1615
01:43:09,504 --> 01:43:18,352
[SPEAKER_15]: I changed my song last week for those who weren't paying attention.

1616
01:43:19,172 --> 01:43:23,136
[SPEAKER_15]: My FU for this week goes to Drama, because I've seen too much of it this week.

1617
01:43:24,056 --> 01:43:25,618
[SPEAKER_15]: And, like, it needs to go away.

1618
01:43:26,739 --> 01:43:27,519
[SPEAKER_06]: I second that.

1619
01:43:27,619 --> 01:43:28,340
[SPEAKER_06]: I second that.

1620
01:43:28,440 --> 01:43:29,761
[SPEAKER_17]: One more FU and I'll keep this music.

1621
01:43:33,124 --> 01:43:34,405
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, this is kind of funny.

1622
01:43:34,905 --> 01:43:38,087
[SPEAKER_17]: Let's just say I'm going to give an F you to Twen just because he thinks he's funny.

1623
01:43:38,487 --> 01:43:38,847
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1624
01:43:39,088 --> 01:43:48,113
[SPEAKER_17]: Twen thinks he's all cool because he went and changed the redirect on my site to some stupid tubgirl.com picture or whatever.

1625
01:43:48,753 --> 01:43:53,116
[SPEAKER_17]: Some stupid chick shooting shit out of her ass and into her mouth, which is all photoshopped anyway.

1626
01:43:53,356 --> 01:43:55,397
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, it's all photoshopped.

1627
01:43:55,417 --> 01:43:56,738
[SPEAKER_17]: But anyways, that's not the point.

1628
01:43:56,758 --> 01:43:58,099
[SPEAKER_17]: Haha, look what I found on the internet.

1629
01:43:58,979 --> 01:43:59,700
[SPEAKER_17]: The whole point is...

1630
01:44:00,120 --> 01:44:04,181
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't care, because I don't use that site anymore, you jackass.

1631
01:44:04,841 --> 01:44:08,222
[SPEAKER_17]: What you did was just, that'd be like someone messing up my GeoCDs webpage.

1632
01:44:08,622 --> 01:44:09,462
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't give a fuck.

1633
01:44:09,822 --> 01:44:12,903
[SPEAKER_17]: I thought it was funny, I laughed, and I laughed at you for trying to be funny.

1634
01:44:13,543 --> 01:44:16,783
[SPEAKER_17]: Or just attempting to insult me in any way, guess what?

1635
01:44:17,144 --> 01:44:19,784
[SPEAKER_17]: You ain't still getting those fucking CDs, and you're a loser.

1636
01:44:19,864 --> 01:44:27,226
[SPEAKER_17]: So, oh, there'll probably be a little special gift for you later on, on the websites, but that'll be later on, so, enjoy.

1637
01:44:27,246 --> 01:44:29,086
[SPEAKER_08]: This is very funny, but you still don't know all of it.

1638
01:44:29,726 --> 01:44:31,428
[SPEAKER_17]: I know, it's hilarious.

1639
01:44:31,528 --> 01:44:37,253
[SPEAKER_02]: I totally, you know... Did you see that bullshit in his live journal, by the way, his username is Twin316?

1640
01:44:37,714 --> 01:44:38,254
[SPEAKER_02]: On live journal?

1641
01:44:38,274 --> 01:44:38,875
[SPEAKER_02]: Go read that.

1642
01:44:38,895 --> 01:44:40,256
[SPEAKER_02]: That's fucking hilarious.

1643
01:44:40,276 --> 01:44:49,404
[SPEAKER_02]: Because he's so stupid that he thought that... I'm sorry, that was... I was literally reading that going, oh my god, how fucking pathetic his life was.

1644
01:44:49,464 --> 01:44:50,906
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, he truly has no life.

1645
01:44:51,326 --> 01:44:52,667
[SPEAKER_17]: You put rape from Loki.

1646
01:44:53,327 --> 01:44:55,188
[SPEAKER_17]: Ah, you're funny, man.

1647
01:44:55,208 --> 01:45:01,870
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait, I mean, I want to know how, and normally I don't talk shit about people, but he really deserves to be talked shit about because he's so stupid.

1648
01:45:02,230 --> 01:45:02,790
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know me.

1649
01:45:03,231 --> 01:45:04,211
[SPEAKER_02]: Do I talk shit about people?

1650
01:45:06,284 --> 01:45:08,085
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm talking shit about him, okay?

1651
01:45:08,545 --> 01:45:21,430
[SPEAKER_02]: First and foremost, first and foremost, anyone who feels the need that they have to do impersonations to try to coerce somebody into saying something that they end up not saying anyway, that's a part of the process.

1652
01:45:23,551 --> 01:45:25,632
[SPEAKER_02]: I can do a better job than that!

1653
01:45:25,652 --> 01:45:28,234
[SPEAKER_17]: If you're gonna fuck up my site, at least put some effort into it.

1654
01:45:28,254 --> 01:45:29,374
[SPEAKER_17]: That was stupid.

1655
01:45:29,654 --> 01:45:33,557
[SPEAKER_18]: My god, shit, how long does it take to fucking put a- You know what's even more disturbing?

1656
01:45:33,597 --> 01:45:35,838
[SPEAKER_18]: You gotta think about his mental state.

1657
01:45:35,958 --> 01:45:39,440
[SPEAKER_18]: If he knew where to find that efficient site, oh my god.

1658
01:45:39,460 --> 01:45:40,301
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, come on.

1659
01:45:40,441 --> 01:45:41,622
[SPEAKER_17]: That was weak, Twain.

1660
01:45:41,882 --> 01:45:43,463
[SPEAKER_17]: Shit, man, you could do better than that.

1661
01:45:43,483 --> 01:45:44,463
[SPEAKER_17]: What the fuck is that?

1662
01:45:44,483 --> 01:45:46,885
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, you put as much effort into that as your fucking remixes.

1663
01:45:48,447 --> 01:45:52,313
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, shit, man, you need to, like... How about this?

1664
01:45:52,474 --> 01:45:53,015
[SPEAKER_17]: I'll tell you what.

1665
01:45:53,035 --> 01:45:57,021
[SPEAKER_17]: Why don't you go get banned from a couple more chat rooms, and then, you know, come talk to me.

1666
01:45:57,121 --> 01:45:59,525
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, wait, you can't because I banned your fucking address.

1667
01:45:59,766 --> 01:46:00,347
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, darn.

1668
01:46:00,687 --> 01:46:01,649
[SPEAKER_17]: Don't give a fuck.

1669
01:46:08,695 --> 01:46:10,876
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't understand why people don't like me!

1670
01:46:11,197 --> 01:46:11,957
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm likeable!

1671
01:46:12,037 --> 01:46:13,198
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm a likeable person!

1672
01:46:13,278 --> 01:46:14,518
[SPEAKER_17]: I should have tons of friends!

1673
01:46:14,538 --> 01:46:15,939
[SPEAKER_17]: The society's messed up!

1674
01:46:29,218 --> 01:46:35,340
[SPEAKER_15]: All I have to say is, you ain't bad, you ain't bad, I run with gangs, I run with gangs, I go to school and I kill people.

1675
01:46:36,020 --> 01:46:44,763
[SPEAKER_02]: And now I have to say this, because I think we've gotten it out of our system, you have to laugh every time his stupid bullshit comes up.

1676
01:46:46,073 --> 01:46:48,034
[SPEAKER_02]: He's not even worth talking about.

1677
01:46:48,495 --> 01:46:48,875
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

1678
01:46:48,935 --> 01:46:50,156
[SPEAKER_02]: He's a waste of breath.

1679
01:46:50,236 --> 01:46:52,257
[SPEAKER_02]: It should be pushed chocolate or something.

1680
01:46:53,238 --> 01:46:53,838
[SPEAKER_02]: So... Ouch!

1681
01:46:54,358 --> 01:46:57,600
[SPEAKER_02]: Why don't we just say... Twin no longer exists.

1682
01:46:58,301 --> 01:46:58,641
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright.

1683
01:46:58,981 --> 01:46:59,301
[SPEAKER_02]: Fair enough.

1684
01:46:59,321 --> 01:47:00,142
[SPEAKER_15]: Agreed.

1685
01:47:00,182 --> 01:47:00,982
[SPEAKER_15]: Agreed.

1686
01:47:01,943 --> 01:47:02,323
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright.

1687
01:47:02,363 --> 01:47:03,324
[SPEAKER_15]: Can I do my FUs now?

1688
01:47:03,364 --> 01:47:04,004
[SPEAKER_06]: Fuck you!

1689
01:47:05,125 --> 01:47:05,985
[SPEAKER_15]: My FU... Oh!

1690
01:47:06,526 --> 01:47:08,127
[SPEAKER_15]: Wasn't I saying my FU goes to drama?

1691
01:47:08,287 --> 01:47:08,667
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright.

1692
01:47:13,759 --> 01:47:21,630
[SPEAKER_15]: My other F you goes to superficial people that don't call you because you won't put out on the first date.

1693
01:47:22,872 --> 01:47:23,633
[SPEAKER_15]: I hate that shit!

1694
01:47:23,653 --> 01:47:24,054
[SPEAKER_15]: Fuck you!

1695
01:47:26,368 --> 01:47:26,708
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, I know.

1696
01:47:27,469 --> 01:47:28,709
[SPEAKER_15]: That's why I've given it an FU.

1697
01:47:29,009 --> 01:47:30,530
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright, I'm done.

1698
01:47:30,590 --> 01:47:31,070
[SPEAKER_15]: I've had enough.

1699
01:47:31,671 --> 01:47:32,451
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's go to Zero.

1700
01:47:32,711 --> 01:47:34,232
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's hear if he has any FUs of the week.

1701
01:47:34,752 --> 01:47:38,034
[SPEAKER_16]: Mine, the same, also pretty much spawned from last night.

1702
01:47:39,495 --> 01:47:44,417
[SPEAKER_16]: That little cowboy skater guy, that was just the greatest ever.

1703
01:47:44,477 --> 01:47:46,138
[SPEAKER_16]: You should see him play when he plays DDR.

1704
01:47:46,178 --> 01:47:48,159
[SPEAKER_16]: He was playing, what was it, Killing Vision?

1705
01:47:48,179 --> 01:47:49,500
[SPEAKER_16]: Like, doing a hoedown to it.

1706
01:47:50,160 --> 01:48:04,381
[SPEAKER_16]: He was doing the whole like, oh yeah, era, he was doing the whole like, can't stamp down, jumping around, jumping around, jumping around, jumping around, jumping around, jumping around, jumping around, jumping around, jumping around, jumping around.

1707
01:48:06,229 --> 01:48:12,435
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, and the fact that, okay, he's, um, the other person who went on the, you know, he had a foot on, so it's a VR thing, right?

1708
01:48:12,455 --> 01:48:24,948
[SPEAKER_16]: So he's always, you know, here, and all of a sudden he goes and picks up this, like, ratty-ass World Industry skateboard, and, like, it's like he's surfing, like, surfing or something, and it's a great VR thing, and it's, like, a good thing.

1709
01:48:25,008 --> 01:48:27,831
[SPEAKER_08]: So that was just, like, it absolutely worked.

1710
01:48:29,967 --> 01:48:36,109
[SPEAKER_18]: First of all, I'm going to state this, and I ask that I have the right to do this as a moderator on DDR Freak.

1711
01:48:36,129 --> 01:48:37,990
[SPEAKER_18]: DDR Freak does not endorse that guy's skateboard.

1712
01:48:38,050 --> 01:48:39,730
[SPEAKER_18]: I feel that I'm justified in saying so.

1713
01:48:48,061 --> 01:48:49,521
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what's really sad about that arcade?

1714
01:48:49,541 --> 01:48:51,802
[SPEAKER_15]: You can tell where they have their priorities.

1715
01:48:51,822 --> 01:48:55,843
[SPEAKER_15]: They have their DDR machines in really shitty conditions.

1716
01:48:55,883 --> 01:48:57,243
[SPEAKER_15]: But wait, what's this in the corner?

1717
01:48:57,263 --> 01:49:00,764
[SPEAKER_17]: 18-wheeler in the giant... It's like an actual size cab of an 18-wheeler truck.

1718
01:49:17,921 --> 01:49:29,616
[SPEAKER_17]: I played that once at whatever Riptide Arcade was before it was Riptide Arcade at Pier 39.

1719
01:49:30,077 --> 01:49:30,958
[SPEAKER_15]: I played that once.

1720
01:49:38,655 --> 01:49:43,096
[SPEAKER_16]: Another thing, don't exactly plan on drinking from the drinking fountains.

1721
01:49:43,917 --> 01:49:48,598
[SPEAKER_16]: You go over there, and there's, like, hamburger and cigarette butts smashed into the drake.

1722
01:49:48,938 --> 01:49:49,558
[SPEAKER_16]: Burger butts?

1723
01:49:49,658 --> 01:49:54,060
[SPEAKER_16]: Burger and cigarette butts smashed into the drake.

1724
01:50:00,966 --> 01:50:06,327
[SPEAKER_15]: Did you ever see that episode of Married with Children when Al was barbecuing hamburgers and using cigarette butts and ashes for the... Yeah.

1725
01:50:07,187 --> 01:50:12,349
[SPEAKER_15]: And then somehow the dead mother got mixed in, I don't know, anyway.

1726
01:50:12,389 --> 01:50:12,589
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, yeah.

1727
01:50:12,629 --> 01:50:14,069
[SPEAKER_15]: Married with Children is the shit, by the way.

1728
01:50:14,129 --> 01:50:23,611
[SPEAKER_08]: And where those drinking pouts were, you'd be afraid to go use them anyway, because they're like... You'd be afraid of getting gang raped or something if you tried to go step back there.

1729
01:50:24,580 --> 01:50:27,421
[SPEAKER_17]: and it would be even better if they had another separate bathroom.

1730
01:50:28,421 --> 01:50:32,642
[SPEAKER_17]: But in front of the doors were arcade games blocking the doors.

1731
01:50:33,702 --> 01:50:36,322
[SPEAKER_17]: Like, you gotta go to the bathroom and get through there.

1732
01:50:36,963 --> 01:50:39,183
[SPEAKER_18]: Hey, I have an idea.

1733
01:50:39,203 --> 01:50:42,044
[SPEAKER_18]: Why don't we look up to the health board and have it sit down?

1734
01:50:42,224 --> 01:50:47,185
[SPEAKER_16]: It's basically like CCL because they have a nice sign on the side of it.

1735
01:50:47,205 --> 01:50:48,625
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, the CCL actually is pretty...

1736
01:50:54,898 --> 01:50:57,020
[SPEAKER_02]: This is for Irene, even though she's not listening.

1737
01:50:57,060 --> 01:50:57,721
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, hello, police?

1738
01:50:57,881 --> 01:51:00,003
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, um, I'm in a wheelchair, and...

1739
01:51:16,007 --> 01:51:17,068
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, actually, Loki gets mad.

1740
01:51:17,088 --> 01:51:17,468
[SPEAKER_15]: Never mind.

1741
01:51:17,548 --> 01:51:18,048
[SPEAKER_15]: Never mind.

1742
01:51:18,549 --> 01:51:19,209
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll tell you guys later.

1743
01:51:19,249 --> 01:51:20,210
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll tell you guys off the show.

1744
01:51:20,450 --> 01:51:23,772
[SPEAKER_16]: The highlight of the night was driving there and driving home.

1745
01:51:24,293 --> 01:51:25,934
[SPEAKER_16]: Pretty much.

1746
01:51:25,974 --> 01:51:38,843
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, the actual arena at Fusar was cool, and that was about the only time you had fun, was when you were playing the game, except we had to wait for an hour for us to get our first game, and then, like, 45 minutes for the second one, when they were just standing around doing nothing.

1747
01:51:38,863 --> 01:51:41,825
[SPEAKER_02]: You just need to have that good trip for both of them to get there.

1748
01:51:43,954 --> 01:51:45,294
[SPEAKER_17]: or just go back to VacVille.

1749
01:51:45,314 --> 01:51:48,536
[SPEAKER_17]: VacVille's fine, it's just they have really bad organization.

1750
01:51:48,736 --> 01:51:54,600
[SPEAKER_17]: Once you, if you're there and demand to go into the game, that's pretty, you'll go in and you'll have a good time.

1751
01:51:54,620 --> 01:51:55,400
[SPEAKER_17]: That's pretty much it.

1752
01:51:55,440 --> 01:51:58,022
[SPEAKER_17]: It's just that they have some really retarded people crowding around the game.

1753
01:51:59,640 --> 01:52:05,126
[SPEAKER_08]: and you get the one guy who, you give him your tickets, like the place, your name, and he says, I'll remember you in the future.

1754
01:52:05,206 --> 01:52:12,614
[SPEAKER_08]: And so we have, yeah, we're like, he's like, I'll remember you, and we come back, and like, we're like, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1755
01:52:15,566 --> 01:52:17,367
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, this is way more important than Vacaville.

1756
01:52:17,427 --> 01:52:18,848
[SPEAKER_15]: I got corrected by VidTawa.

1757
01:52:19,308 --> 01:52:31,394
[SPEAKER_15]: He said, actually, Peggy spilled Al's barbecue charcoal, and then she told Kelly and Bud to go find some ashes for her, and Kelly goes and steals Darcy's dead mother's ashes, and gives it to Peggy, and then Al cooks the burgers with the dead Darcy ashes.

1758
01:52:31,414 --> 01:52:34,976
[SPEAKER_17]: That's right, because ashes make the burgers taste good.

1759
01:52:35,076 --> 01:52:38,098
[SPEAKER_15]: But I could have sworn there were cigarettes without ashes as part of the joke.

1760
01:52:38,258 --> 01:52:39,058
[SPEAKER_15]: Maybe that was another show.

1761
01:52:39,078 --> 01:52:40,219
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm getting my wires crossed.

1762
01:52:40,559 --> 01:52:43,622
[SPEAKER_15]: All right, sorry to interrupt, but you know, Mary just showed me some shit and all.

1763
01:52:43,642 --> 01:52:48,746
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if I can just answer, but after we hear that, you're going to have to stop recording.

1764
01:52:49,246 --> 01:52:51,648
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, yeah, yeah, maybe that'll... Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1765
01:52:51,748 --> 01:52:52,309
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

1766
01:52:52,949 --> 01:52:54,230
[SPEAKER_15]: All right, are you done, Cyril?

1767
01:52:54,831 --> 01:52:56,432
[SPEAKER_15]: All right, moving on to Dave.

1768
01:52:56,692 --> 01:53:01,476
[SPEAKER_15]: And the chat room is getting a little upset because we're not that angsty right now, so you better have some angst in you, Dave.

1769
01:53:02,116 --> 01:53:02,557
[SPEAKER_15]: No pressure.

1770
01:53:02,697 --> 01:53:03,177
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll try.

1771
01:53:04,118 --> 01:53:06,560
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, and thank you, Rob, for giving this up.

1772
01:53:06,600 --> 01:53:06,860
[SPEAKER_12]: It's cool.

1773
01:53:09,000 --> 01:53:32,869
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, um, well, just to let people know I got my license like a week ago or something, and I'm happy about that, but, what, no, I don't have my car, I'm driving my brother's car, right now I'm driving my car, anyway, and fuck the DMV for being the biggest piece of shit ever, oh my god, it's like you get outside and go to Inline and

1774
01:53:34,750 --> 01:53:37,151
[SPEAKER_12]: The line is like a rollercoaster line.

1775
01:53:37,211 --> 01:53:50,877
[SPEAKER_12]: It goes, curves around four times, then goes outside the door, and then, so we wait in line for about an hour and a half, and we're late for our, you know, then we get there, oh, you're waiting in the wrong line.

1776
01:53:51,337 --> 01:53:59,641
[SPEAKER_12]: Go wait in that line, and there's two people in that line, and there's only two people in that line, and so then it's like, shit, I could be out of here by now.

1777
01:54:00,532 --> 01:54:19,039
[SPEAKER_12]: So then after we go there, and I get my appointment, I'm angsty, and then I have to go wait in another line, which is you drive your car up, turn the power off, wait 15 minutes, move one spot, wait 20 minutes, and then after about two hours, I finally finish, and so the DMV fucking pisses me off.

1778
01:54:19,579 --> 01:54:20,719
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck you, DMV!

1779
01:54:21,860 --> 01:54:22,660
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm angsty!

1780
01:54:23,220 --> 01:54:24,121
[SPEAKER_04]: Wah!

1781
01:54:24,841 --> 01:54:27,583
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, I was going to go on the front like this.

1782
01:54:45,755 --> 01:54:47,296
[SPEAKER_16]: I knew that old people drove slow.

1783
01:54:47,396 --> 01:54:48,736
[SPEAKER_12]: I knew that old people drove slow.

1784
01:55:11,944 --> 01:55:14,406
[SPEAKER_12]: But I didn't know that all keyboards are stupid.

1785
01:55:14,446 --> 01:55:18,108
[SPEAKER_12]: Like, they drive, and they see a red light maybe 100 meters up.

1786
01:55:18,468 --> 01:55:22,491
[SPEAKER_12]: They start slowing down, and they're going 30 at the time in a 45 zone.

1787
01:55:23,211 --> 01:55:25,553
[SPEAKER_12]: And they start slowing down to about 5 miles an hour.

1788
01:55:26,013 --> 01:55:30,135
[SPEAKER_12]: The light's still red, they've got about 50 meters to go until they hit the red light.

1789
01:55:30,556 --> 01:55:32,737
[SPEAKER_12]: And they're going at, you know, 5 miles an hour.

1790
01:55:33,317 --> 01:55:38,040
[SPEAKER_12]: And then the light turns green, they pull to a complete stop, and then they go, like it's a stop sign.

1791
01:55:38,060 --> 01:55:40,582
[SPEAKER_18]: And then when they stop behind you, they appear like they're in the background.

1792
01:55:40,982 --> 01:55:46,803
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I was actually hit, like, half by an old person, but I didn't want to say anything.

1793
01:55:46,884 --> 01:55:48,104
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, but you ain't seen nothing yet.

1794
01:55:48,144 --> 01:55:53,645
[SPEAKER_17]: There's also the young drivers, no offense to you, man, but there's young drivers that are just stupid, like Prince and Snape.

1795
01:55:53,665 --> 01:55:54,225
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, I know, I know.

1796
01:55:54,245 --> 01:55:56,186
[SPEAKER_17]: I was parking right here at San Juan.

1797
01:55:56,346 --> 01:55:59,547
[SPEAKER_17]: There's police cars going everywhere, okay, lights, sirens on.

1798
01:55:59,727 --> 01:56:08,689
[SPEAKER_17]: Two police cars behind this dumb bitch, and she's just standing there, like, she's sitting there at the red light, and they're honking their horns, and she's, like, waving her arms, going, I don't know what to do, I don't know what to do!

1799
01:56:09,049 --> 01:56:10,650
[SPEAKER_17]: Drive forward, you fucking dumbass!

1800
01:56:10,670 --> 01:56:11,731
[SPEAKER_17]: You're trying to go someplace!

1801
01:56:12,011 --> 01:56:17,774
[SPEAKER_17]: So then finally she pulls forward a little bit in front of my car, and they nearly hit her ass, and I wish they did because I would serve her right.

1802
01:56:20,135 --> 01:56:36,043
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, anyway, back to my FUs, and I'm kind of scrounged for them, but I think I had a couple more, um, wait, let me think, on 2DX, just fuck all the songs that I can't pass, that's not big news, and fuck Legend of Max for me not being able to pass them yet.

1803
01:56:37,074 --> 01:56:45,647
[SPEAKER_12]: and damn it, fuck my memory for doing this a lot and forgetting what I was going to say about fucking other things.

1804
01:56:45,807 --> 01:56:47,149
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright, shine, lose, you're finished.

1805
01:56:47,169 --> 01:56:47,770
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, I'm done.

1806
01:56:47,850 --> 01:56:48,131

01:56:56,278 --> 01:56:57,619
[SPEAKER_15]: You're going to get quoted first.

01:56:58,339 --> 01:56:58,699
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

1812
01:56:59,300 --> 01:57:04,041
[SPEAKER_15]: King-sized fuck you to parents who think that since they like auto shows, you like auto shows, bitches.

[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, fuck you.

01:57:19,007 --> 01:57:20,688
[SPEAKER_02]: What the fuck were you doing knee dropping anyway?

[SPEAKER_15]: At least drive me to Scandia once a week.

1829
01:57:31,570 --> 01:57:32,790
[SPEAKER_15]: Is that too much fucking much to ask?

1830
01:57:33,930 --> 01:57:35,671
[SPEAKER_15]: DarkTetsuya, fuck being single.

[SPEAKER_15]: What do we want to hear this break?

1864
02:00:12,071 --> 02:00:13,973
[SPEAKER_15]: Wasn't there something we wanted to hear earlier in the show?

1865
02:00:15,474 --> 02:00:16,735
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's do a disgusting break.

1866
02:00:16,975 --> 02:00:17,836
[SPEAKER_15]: A disgusting break?

1867
02:00:17,856 --> 02:00:18,776
[SPEAKER_15]: Like bad music break?

1868
02:00:18,796 --> 02:00:19,317
[SPEAKER_15]: Like lots of Eurobeat.

1869
02:00:19,817 --> 02:00:20,978
[SPEAKER_15]: Ooh, Eurobeat break.

1870
02:00:21,619 --> 02:00:21,719
[SPEAKER_15]: Uh...

1871
02:00:23,144 --> 02:00:24,707
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, I know, we don't want to lose all the listeners.

1872
02:00:25,167 --> 02:00:27,291
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, um, alright, I got it, I got it, I got it.

1873
02:00:27,311 --> 02:00:29,854
[SPEAKER_15]: We can do some of those shitty things from Dance Maniacs, too.

1874
02:00:30,215 --> 02:00:30,475
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

02:00:33,039 --> 02:00:33,880
[SPEAKER_15]: You said, I got it, I got it.

1877
02:00:34,321 --> 02:00:34,621
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

1878
02:00:35,863 --> 02:00:36,564
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, you want to hear that?

1879
02:00:36,584 --> 02:00:36,985
[SPEAKER_15]: We're going to hear...

1880
02:00:37,970 --> 02:00:43,235
[SPEAKER_15]: We're going to hear the Long Train Runnin' version by Xtreme, the band that did A Minute and stuff.

1881
02:00:43,255 --> 02:00:44,356
[SPEAKER_02]: Do Let the Music Play.

1882
02:00:44,577 --> 02:00:49,181
[SPEAKER_15]: This is not the same Long Train Runnin' that Bus Stop did, which is in Max 2.

1883
02:00:49,221 --> 02:00:52,565
[SPEAKER_15]: This is Xtreme's version of it, and it doesn't sound a goddamn thing like the original.

1884
02:00:52,865 --> 02:00:57,349
[SPEAKER_15]: And after that, we're going to let it go right into Bus Stop with Let the Music Play.

1885
02:00:57,870 --> 02:00:58,671
[SPEAKER_15]: By the way, this is funny.

1886
02:00:58,691 --> 02:00:59,812
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually like this mix.

1887
02:00:59,932 --> 02:01:01,274
[SPEAKER_15]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1888
02:01:20,316 --> 02:01:21,476
[SPEAKER_15]: Jamie, headpicked.

1889
02:01:21,696 --> 02:01:22,817
[SPEAKER_02]: Shannon, let the music play.

1890
02:01:22,917 --> 02:01:24,177
[SPEAKER_15]: Shannon, let the music play.

1891
02:01:24,917 --> 02:01:28,198
[SPEAKER_15]: And lo and behold, now we have Bus Stop doing Let the Music Play.

1892
02:01:28,919 --> 02:01:36,981
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright, and then I'm supposed to play one of these new promos that some of our fans worked on, so I'll get that in there too.

1893
02:01:37,701 --> 02:01:38,862
[SPEAKER_15]: I want to dance!

1894
02:01:38,882 --> 02:01:39,422
[SPEAKER_15]: I want to dance!

1895
02:04:58,831 --> 02:05:03,152
[SPEAKER_17]: Welcome to Orange Launch Radio, where love is orange.

1896
02:05:04,032 --> 02:05:05,493
[SPEAKER_17]: Shaving monkeys is always permitted.

1897
02:05:06,653 --> 02:05:07,113
[SPEAKER_17]: Just kidding.

1898
02:05:07,373 --> 02:05:14,055
[SPEAKER_17]: But... But it's... You scare the monkey, you don't come in.

1899
02:05:14,175 --> 02:05:18,116
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, I'll just bring Shermie.

1900
02:05:20,797 --> 02:05:22,357
[SPEAKER_00]: If Shermie doesn't like you, leave.

1901
02:05:22,938 --> 02:05:26,250
[SPEAKER_00]: Proceeding, as always, was brought to you by Orange Lounge Radio.

1902
02:09:04,936 --> 02:09:06,637
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright, that was Bus Stop, we'll let the music play.

1903
02:09:06,657 --> 02:09:12,320
[SPEAKER_15]: We're going to do one more song from Dance Mania EX2 because we decided we want to do a list list when we come back and we need time to make our lists.

1904
02:09:12,881 --> 02:09:15,782
[SPEAKER_15]: So, one more song from Dance Mania EX2 and I'll tell you what.

1905
02:09:15,802 --> 02:09:17,023
[SPEAKER_15]: That's something disgusting.

1906
02:09:17,063 --> 02:09:19,945
[SPEAKER_15]: You're going to love this song or you're going to freaking hate it.

1907
02:09:20,305 --> 02:09:26,528
[SPEAKER_15]: Y'all know Creamy, they're the band that did I Do, I Do, I Do in Dance Revolution Extreme.

1908
02:09:26,548 --> 02:09:27,629
[SPEAKER_15]: I do, I do, I do.

1909
02:09:28,269 --> 02:09:29,290
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't, I don't, I don't.

1910
02:09:30,310 --> 02:09:33,312
[SPEAKER_15]: Anyway, Creamy did a cover of The NeverEnding Story.

1911
02:09:33,712 --> 02:09:35,774
[SPEAKER_15]: And it's so cute, it'll make you barf.

1912
02:09:36,414 --> 02:09:37,214
[SPEAKER_15]: So enjoy.

1913
02:09:37,254 --> 02:09:39,115
[SPEAKER_15]: This is Creamy with The NeverEnding Story.

1914
02:09:39,516 --> 02:09:40,836
[SPEAKER_15]: It has a mix name.

1915
02:09:40,877 --> 02:09:44,919
[SPEAKER_15]: It's actually the Manhattan Click Extended Remix here on Orange Lounge Radio.

1916
02:09:45,179 --> 02:09:47,240
[SPEAKER_15]: Enjoy or despise, you be the judge.

1917
02:09:47,260 --> 02:09:48,361
[SPEAKER_15]: And we'll be back with Listless.

1918
02:12:47,873 --> 02:12:48,902
Thank you for watching!

1919
02:13:35,643 --> 02:13:36,063
[SPEAKER_15]: Hello?

1920
02:13:36,844 --> 02:13:37,124
[SPEAKER_15]: Hello?

1921
02:13:37,164 --> 02:13:37,845
[SPEAKER_15]: Is this thing on?

1922
02:13:37,905 --> 02:13:38,425
[SPEAKER_15]: Testing.

1923
02:13:39,606 --> 02:13:40,467
[SPEAKER_15]: Testing 1-2.

1924
02:13:41,047 --> 02:13:44,990
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm looking in the index, but I don't see anything for how to run a radio show.

1925
02:13:45,090 --> 02:13:45,570
[SPEAKER_15]: Hello?

1926
02:13:46,231 --> 02:13:47,692
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't understand this.

1927
02:13:48,372 --> 02:13:49,073
[SPEAKER_15]: Does this thing work?

1928
02:13:49,093 --> 02:13:50,674
[SPEAKER_02]: This thing reads like stereo instructions.

1929
02:13:50,774 --> 02:13:51,335
[SPEAKER_02]: Is this on?

1930
02:13:51,355 --> 02:13:51,975
[SPEAKER_02]: What the hell?

1931
02:13:54,517 --> 02:13:58,300
[SPEAKER_01]: Orange Lounge Radio, Broke Down Ghetto Bomani Radio.

1932
02:13:58,380 --> 02:13:58,600
[SPEAKER_01]: What the?

1933
02:14:00,475 --> 02:14:01,256
[SPEAKER_15]: Hi, we're back.

1934
02:14:01,837 --> 02:14:03,018
[SPEAKER_15]: You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

1935
02:14:03,659 --> 02:14:12,228
[SPEAKER_15]: As we promised during that last one, I was creamy with the never-ending story from Dance Mania EX2, so it could be on DDR very possibly.

1936
02:14:12,689 --> 02:14:15,892
[SPEAKER_15]: And of course, we had some people, we had DDRholics, says it's so cute!

1937
02:14:16,213 --> 02:14:17,434
[SPEAKER_15]: And what did she say that was really funny?

1938
02:14:17,454 --> 02:14:19,957
[SPEAKER_15]: It was something about, uh... God, what was it?

1939
02:14:19,977 --> 02:14:21,058
[SPEAKER_15]: It was really funny, she said.

1940
02:14:22,960 --> 02:14:25,521
[SPEAKER_15]: Something about hamsters dancing in the sky or something like that.

1941
02:14:25,541 --> 02:14:26,101
[SPEAKER_15]: It was really funny.

1942
02:14:26,161 --> 02:14:26,682
[SPEAKER_15]: I can't find it.

1943
02:14:26,742 --> 02:14:26,962
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh well.

1944
02:14:28,443 --> 02:14:33,766
[SPEAKER_15]: And then of course we have Arcadian says it sucks and EOSFVB says this song should be banned.

1945
02:14:34,967 --> 02:14:36,368
[SPEAKER_02]: This song gives me an aneurysm.

1946
02:14:37,388 --> 02:14:42,711
[SPEAKER_15]: Won't be in regular Orange Lounge rotation anytime soon but we reserve the right to play it during any fuck off we want.

1947
02:14:43,092 --> 02:14:43,372
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright.

1948
02:14:44,266 --> 02:14:45,387
[SPEAKER_15]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

[SPEAKER_15]: The address is right in the topic of our chat room.

1950
02:15:07,970 --> 02:15:11,814
[SPEAKER_15]: It's also linked from our website, orangelounge.skie.cx.

1951
02:15:12,434 --> 02:15:13,535
[SPEAKER_15]: And then you just click on forums.

1952
02:15:13,555 --> 02:15:14,236
[SPEAKER_15]: It'll take you right there.

1953
02:15:14,376 --> 02:15:21,263
[SPEAKER_15]: Or if you need the website, here it is, www.calibermani.com slash NBOR3.

1954
02:15:22,184 --> 02:15:27,990
[SPEAKER_15]: And we merged with the Naoki Boards of Randomness because they rock and we're a part of their forums.

1955
02:15:29,191 --> 02:15:37,274
[SPEAKER_15]: So, you need to get your ass over there to the Orange Lounge forums Because this was an idea that came from the listless suggestion thread And who would have thunk it?

1956
02:15:37,954 --> 02:15:53,400
[SPEAKER_15]: Dave was the one that suggested this topic Yay So you should go post in that listless suggestion thread if you think you have an idea Because we're doing this one tonight It was Dave's idea Best warm-up song for DDR

1957
02:15:54,899 --> 02:15:56,521
[SPEAKER_15]: So what exactly would be a warm-up song?

1958
02:15:57,021 --> 02:16:00,686
[SPEAKER_15]: You don't have to name it, but describe a warm-up song.

1959
02:16:01,046 --> 02:16:02,207
[SPEAKER_15]: What defines a warm-up song?

1960
02:16:02,928 --> 02:16:11,999
[SPEAKER_12]: The first song you play as a warm-up for your other songs that might be more physically demanding.

1961
02:16:12,566 --> 02:16:16,147
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that when we say what our pick is, we should say why we like it as a warm-up song.

1962
02:16:16,207 --> 02:16:16,407
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

1963
02:16:16,987 --> 02:16:19,708
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's basically, I would... There goes the mic.

1964
02:16:20,649 --> 02:16:29,211
[SPEAKER_12]: And I would basically think that it would be something very fun and easygoing and not too challenging because... Just starting.

1965
02:16:30,132 --> 02:16:30,352
[SPEAKER_12]: What?

1966
02:16:32,352 --> 02:16:35,613
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, it depends on what you're... If you're warming up for Legend of Max, you might play Max 300.

1967
02:16:36,054 --> 02:16:36,414
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know.

1968
02:16:37,334 --> 02:16:37,414
Ah!

1969
02:16:39,163 --> 02:16:40,605
[SPEAKER_15]: We have a request before we get started.

1970
02:16:41,005 --> 02:16:42,387
[SPEAKER_15]: Angel wants you to say, we.

1971
02:16:43,007 --> 02:16:43,248
[SPEAKER_15]: We.

1972
02:16:43,968 --> 02:16:44,829
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

1973
02:16:44,849 --> 02:16:45,150
[SPEAKER_13]: That's it.

1974
02:16:45,530 --> 02:16:45,790
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

1975
02:16:46,151 --> 02:16:47,032
[SPEAKER_15]: And do the Black Mage.

1976
02:16:49,574 --> 02:16:50,455
[SPEAKER_12]: Wait, what does he do again?

1977
02:16:50,475 --> 02:16:51,977
[SPEAKER_12]: Do the bolt thing.

1978
02:16:52,257 --> 02:16:52,698
[SPEAKER_15]: Never mind.

1979
02:16:52,818 --> 02:16:53,238
[SPEAKER_15]: Forget it.

1980
02:16:54,900 --> 02:16:56,061
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's just get into it.

1981
02:16:56,121 --> 02:16:57,042
[SPEAKER_15]: All right, Dave, you start.

1982
02:16:57,383 --> 02:16:57,703
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

1983
02:16:58,484 --> 02:17:00,366
[SPEAKER_12]: My first one is...

1984
02:17:02,299 --> 02:17:04,422
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh yeah, I'm being lazy tonight.

1985
02:17:04,903 --> 02:17:07,386
[SPEAKER_15]: No, Jamie, you need to memorize all of these.

1986
02:17:07,807 --> 02:17:09,449
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't want to erase the erotic ones.

1987
02:17:09,489 --> 02:17:10,370
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll just do it underneath, though.

1988
02:17:10,410 --> 02:17:11,051
[SPEAKER_15]: Do it on this page.

1989
02:17:11,071 --> 02:17:11,532
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, here we go.

1990
02:17:14,355 --> 02:17:17,717
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, I think... Yes, Rob?

1991
02:17:18,137 --> 02:17:19,137
[SPEAKER_15]: Sorry, I'm just laughing.

1992
02:17:20,238 --> 02:17:25,681
[SPEAKER_15]: DDRholic already gave us a suggestion for Jane Jonna because it's so smooth and it makes you want to pinch your butt cheeks.

1993
02:17:27,461 --> 02:17:27,782
[SPEAKER_15]: What?

1994
02:17:27,802 --> 02:17:30,683
[SPEAKER_15]: Never mind, I just thought that was funny.

1995
02:17:30,783 --> 02:17:31,583
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright, go ahead, go.

1996
02:17:31,764 --> 02:17:40,108
[SPEAKER_12]: Anyway, my first one is Moonlight Shadow because it was really fun and I played it on doubles all the time right before I played Oops, I Did It Again.

1997
02:17:40,528 --> 02:17:41,308
[SPEAKER_12]: Fired up mix.

1998
02:17:42,429 --> 02:17:42,809
[SPEAKER_12]: Did it.

1999
02:17:44,674 --> 02:17:45,355
[SPEAKER_02]: La Copa De Vida

2000
02:18:16,475 --> 02:18:17,996
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my god, you suck.

2001
02:18:18,036 --> 02:18:18,916
[SPEAKER_02]: So, Changers.

2002
02:18:19,817 --> 02:18:24,699
[SPEAKER_15]: La Coba De Vida, because it's pretty easy to perfect attack, yet it has kind of a lot of different things in it.

2003
02:18:24,719 --> 02:18:26,980
[SPEAKER_15]: Triplets, eighth notes, and you know what?

2004
02:18:27,541 --> 02:18:31,783
[SPEAKER_15]: People cringe when they hear a Ricky Martin cover, but the song, it actually isn't that bad.

2005
02:18:31,823 --> 02:18:33,344
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, it's, yeah.

2006
02:18:34,164 --> 02:18:35,445
[SPEAKER_12]: Dude, that song kicks ass.

2007
02:18:35,465 --> 02:18:38,306
[SPEAKER_12]: That was my first choice, but you suck.

2008
02:18:39,427 --> 02:18:39,767
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.

2009
02:18:40,648 --> 02:18:41,268
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, Jamie, sure.

2010
02:18:41,508 --> 02:18:43,530
[SPEAKER_02]: My number three pick is Kakumei Maniac.

2011
02:18:43,810 --> 02:18:44,731
[SPEAKER_15]: Kakumei!

2012
02:18:45,252 --> 02:18:45,652
[SPEAKER_02]: Maniac.

2013
02:18:46,232 --> 02:18:46,753
[SPEAKER_02]: Specifically.

2014
02:18:47,594 --> 02:18:48,194
[SPEAKER_02]: Kakumei Maniac.

2015
02:18:48,214 --> 02:18:54,860
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I, alright, a lot of people notice that I don't play with freezers and I do it for a legitimate reason because of my ankle being weak.

2016
02:18:55,441 --> 02:19:00,446
[SPEAKER_02]: If I have to hold my foot in one position for entirely too long, especially when I'm stepping the other way, it hurts.

2017
02:19:00,926 --> 02:19:02,948
[SPEAKER_02]: The thing I like about Kakumei is that it's very easy.

2018
02:19:03,972 --> 02:19:15,575
[SPEAKER_02]: as the gallops help me, you know, warm up my legs and everything and get my knees to where they don't hurt and then it, at the end of the song it goes into their run so I'm building up into something better.

2019
02:19:17,456 --> 02:19:18,756
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually have legitimate reasons.

2020
02:19:19,436 --> 02:19:20,236
[SPEAKER_17]: Good pick, good pick.

2021
02:19:20,556 --> 02:19:21,137
[SPEAKER_17]: Alright, Zero.

2022
02:19:22,257 --> 02:19:22,397
[SPEAKER_16]: Um,

2023
02:19:22,782 --> 02:19:26,823
[SPEAKER_16]: My number three would be doing Miracle Moon on doubles on the heavy.

2024
02:19:27,363 --> 02:19:31,344
[SPEAKER_16]: Mostly because it'll work me up into doing my freestyle stuff like Let the Beacon.

2025
02:19:31,364 --> 02:19:33,685
[SPEAKER_15]: Do you want to specifically say doubles heavy or just Miracle Moon?

2026
02:19:34,325 --> 02:19:35,045
[SPEAKER_16]: Miracle Moon double.

2027
02:19:36,846 --> 02:19:38,526
[SPEAKER_16]: Because it's not very hard on singles.

2028
02:19:39,206 --> 02:19:39,486
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

2029
02:19:41,467 --> 02:19:42,267
[SPEAKER_15]: Miracle Moon.

2030
02:19:44,068 --> 02:19:45,388
[SPEAKER_15]: Loki, your number three pick.

2031
02:19:45,408 --> 02:19:47,389
[SPEAKER_17]: It's all about superstar heavy.

2032
02:19:47,469 --> 02:19:48,649
[SPEAKER_15]: Superstar.

2033
02:19:48,669 --> 02:19:49,109
[SPEAKER_17]: Dammit.

2034
02:19:52,143 --> 02:19:53,124
[SPEAKER_15]: I knew that would happen.

2035
02:19:53,604 --> 02:19:54,864
[SPEAKER_15]: That's why I didn't put Superstar.

2036
02:19:54,884 --> 02:20:00,726
[SPEAKER_15]: I stayed away from that because I knew you guys would totally be putting that.

2037
02:20:00,846 --> 02:20:02,087
[SPEAKER_15]: Dave, your number two pick.

2038
02:20:02,407 --> 02:20:10,029
[SPEAKER_12]: My number two pick is Senorita.

2039
02:20:10,770 --> 02:20:11,410
[SPEAKER_12]: Senorita.

2040
02:20:12,904 --> 02:20:14,926
[SPEAKER_12]: I always play that right after I play La Copa De La Vida.

2041
02:20:15,106 --> 02:20:19,210
[SPEAKER_12]: Because it gets me really happy, and then I can play a heart song.

2042
02:20:19,310 --> 02:20:20,091
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, it makes you happy.

2043
02:20:22,013 --> 02:20:22,934
[SPEAKER_13]: Happy, happy, happy.

2044
02:20:23,014 --> 02:20:23,835
[SPEAKER_15]: I feel happy.

2045
02:20:25,577 --> 02:20:32,984
[SPEAKER_15]: My number two pick, because this is just great, and everybody loves it when I play this song, and you all love to listen to it, and you know it.

2046
02:20:33,244 --> 02:20:34,626
[SPEAKER_15]: My number two pick is this Rain of Men.

2047
02:20:36,500 --> 02:20:37,521
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's not a surprise.

2048
02:20:37,721 --> 02:20:40,362
[SPEAKER_15]: Because it's not too difficult, and it's fun.

2049
02:20:40,942 --> 02:20:41,542
[SPEAKER_15]: It's happy.

2050
02:20:41,723 --> 02:20:43,263
[SPEAKER_15]: And it makes people turn their heads.

2051
02:20:43,423 --> 02:20:43,924
[SPEAKER_02]: It's happy.

2052
02:20:44,004 --> 02:20:44,604
[SPEAKER_15]: And it's happy.

2053
02:20:45,364 --> 02:20:46,185
[SPEAKER_15]: So it's Rain and Men.

2054
02:20:46,205 --> 02:20:47,065
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, my number two.

2055
02:20:47,265 --> 02:20:48,046
[SPEAKER_02]: Your number two, Jamie.

2056
02:20:48,186 --> 02:20:49,326
[SPEAKER_02]: Someone took my number one, Loki.

2057
02:20:50,507 --> 02:20:52,448
[SPEAKER_02]: My number two is Share My Love, Maniac.

2058
02:20:52,728 --> 02:20:53,508
[SPEAKER_02]: Share My Love.

2059
02:20:53,728 --> 02:20:55,149
[SPEAKER_02]: It makes you watch.

2060
02:20:55,209 --> 02:20:57,150
[SPEAKER_02]: It starts you watching the arrows.

2061
02:20:57,170 --> 02:20:59,311
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's more like a mental warm-up.

2062
02:21:00,271 --> 02:21:01,072
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a mental warm-up.

2063
02:21:01,392 --> 02:21:01,552
[SPEAKER_15]: Cool.

2064
02:21:03,783 --> 02:21:04,763
[SPEAKER_15]: Zero, you're number two pick.

2065
02:21:04,923 --> 02:21:07,284
[SPEAKER_16]: My second one is Little Bitch.

2066
02:21:07,824 --> 02:21:08,664
[SPEAKER_16]: Little Bitch!

2067
02:21:08,784 --> 02:21:17,805
[SPEAKER_16]: Because not only does it match the specials shirt I just got the other day, but it's a good warm-up for going into my Ska routine that I'm working on.

2068
02:21:18,766 --> 02:21:19,746
[SPEAKER_16]: It'll be good when I get it done.

2069
02:21:20,226 --> 02:21:23,506
[SPEAKER_15]: So we're talking about the original Little Bitch, not Bus Stop's one-two Little Bitch.

2070
02:21:23,566 --> 02:21:25,847
[SPEAKER_16]: No, the original, original specials.

2071
02:21:26,467 --> 02:21:26,847
[SPEAKER_15]: Cool!

2072
02:21:29,567 --> 02:21:29,808
[SPEAKER_15]: Loki.

2073
02:21:29,828 --> 02:21:31,428
[SPEAKER_17]: Let's see, Let's Groove...

2074
02:21:36,052 --> 02:21:37,533
[SPEAKER_17]: Let's screw up tonight

2075
02:21:49,481 --> 02:21:50,902
Oh, hello.

2076
02:21:51,242 --> 02:21:51,803
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, Dave.

2077
02:21:53,404 --> 02:21:54,524
[SPEAKER_02]: Earth, wind, and fire, you ain't.

2078
02:21:55,025 --> 02:21:55,305
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

2079
02:21:56,245 --> 02:21:59,407
[SPEAKER_12]: Anyway, my number one actually has a story kind of behind it.

2080
02:22:00,088 --> 02:22:05,111
[SPEAKER_12]: And, um, it was a long... The story is that your real number one got taken.

2081
02:22:05,991 --> 02:22:10,553
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, that was the story for my number two, but now it's moved on up the list.

2082
02:22:11,313 --> 02:22:13,474
[SPEAKER_12]: And because I can't think of anything else off the top of my head.

2083
02:22:14,014 --> 02:22:17,835
[SPEAKER_12]: And it was, I think, a year or a year and a half ago, maybe two years.

2084
02:22:20,036 --> 02:22:24,137
[SPEAKER_12]: Wow, Jamie's holding a lighting pen up to her forehead so she can see the lights.

2085
02:22:25,377 --> 02:22:33,000
[SPEAKER_12]: And it was the first time that I ever met Rob and Jamie and all these other people.

2086
02:22:33,700 --> 02:22:35,563
[SPEAKER_12]: that I thought were really weird at the time.

2087
02:22:36,505 --> 02:22:46,783
[SPEAKER_12]: And I played with Rob the first time before I'd met him on a fourth mix at Roseville Golf Land and he picked

2088
02:22:48,365 --> 02:22:51,068
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know, was it Bumblebee or something like that?

2089
02:22:51,148 --> 02:22:55,672
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, one of the songs that my brother plays with me.

2090
02:22:56,012 --> 02:22:57,033
[SPEAKER_12]: And then I picked Dropout.

2091
02:22:57,493 --> 02:22:58,234
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's my choice.

2092
02:22:58,494 --> 02:22:59,155
[SPEAKER_12]: Just Dropout.

2093
02:22:59,455 --> 02:23:00,636
[SPEAKER_12]: Because it was so fun.

2094
02:23:01,157 --> 02:23:03,599
[SPEAKER_12]: And Rob was just like gasping for breath.

2095
02:23:03,879 --> 02:23:05,200
[SPEAKER_12]: He's like, this is my first game.

2096
02:23:06,081 --> 02:23:06,682
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my god.

2097
02:23:07,122 --> 02:23:08,043
[SPEAKER_12]: And I was like, sorry.

2098
02:23:08,083 --> 02:23:10,865
[SPEAKER_12]: And then I picked Afronova afterwards to fuck with him.

2099
02:23:11,846 --> 02:23:13,688
[SPEAKER_12]: No, but Dropout because it's really fun.

2100
02:23:14,429 --> 02:23:14,809
[SPEAKER_12]: And yeah.

2101
02:23:15,575 --> 02:23:42,564
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, alright It gets me warmed up, you ass Alright That made me think though, I left one off my list I really want to put it on here, but I guess next time But the number one, and it deserves to be my number one Because this was the ultimate warm up song Especially back in the day, I always played this first song You know it, this song is the shit Oh Nick, please not so quick God, all the fucking time We got the fourth mix, you were like Oh my god, I love you, Onik I want to help the machine

2102
02:23:43,345 --> 02:23:44,766
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see if I can fit in the coin slot.

2103
02:23:46,268 --> 02:23:46,708
[SPEAKER_12]: Please.

2104
02:23:48,009 --> 02:23:49,711
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually remember you saying that once.

2105
02:23:53,454 --> 02:23:54,355
[SPEAKER_15]: It wouldn't surprise me at all.

2106
02:23:54,375 --> 02:23:55,976
[SPEAKER_02]: It was right before my birthday, come to think of it.

2107
02:23:57,878 --> 02:23:58,178
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

2108
02:23:59,259 --> 02:23:59,880
[SPEAKER_02]: My number one.

2109
02:24:00,681 --> 02:24:00,921
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

2110
02:24:01,361 --> 02:24:03,763
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, my original number one got taken, so my number two moved up.

2111
02:24:04,004 --> 02:24:04,264
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

2112
02:24:04,584 --> 02:24:07,447
[SPEAKER_02]: And everyone knows that I've been starting off with this a lot lately.

2113
02:24:07,947 --> 02:24:08,728
[SPEAKER_02]: Cowgirl Maniac.

2114
02:24:10,419 --> 02:24:12,400
[SPEAKER_02]: Just because the little Skippy Hops.

2115
02:24:12,921 --> 02:24:16,143
[SPEAKER_02]: I normally suck at Skippy Hops, and now I can do Skippy Hops really well.

2116
02:24:17,484 --> 02:24:18,124
[SPEAKER_02]: The Skippy Hops.

2117
02:24:18,344 --> 02:24:24,669
[SPEAKER_02]: Because they're not the true... I don't consider them true gallops like in, you know, Saints Go Marching or like in Rhythm and Police.

2118
02:24:24,949 --> 02:24:25,689
[SPEAKER_02]: They're Skippy Hops.

2119
02:24:26,670 --> 02:24:27,250
[SPEAKER_02]: Skippy Hops!

2120
02:24:28,071 --> 02:24:29,912
[SPEAKER_02]: Sounds like a breakfast.

2121
02:24:32,654 --> 02:24:33,855
[SPEAKER_15]: New Cowgirl Skippy Hops.

2122
02:24:33,955 --> 02:24:35,056
[SPEAKER_02]: Grassy Sod Klops.

2123
02:24:35,476 --> 02:24:36,737
[SPEAKER_02]: That was on Ren and Sippy.

2124
02:24:38,298 --> 02:24:40,099
[SPEAKER_02]: With that freshly mowed lawn flavor.

2125
02:24:41,667 --> 02:24:41,927
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway.

2126
02:24:42,427 --> 02:24:43,468
[SPEAKER_17]: Zero, your number one choice.

2127
02:24:44,168 --> 02:24:47,769
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, yeah, I'm surprised that guy over at, uh, Vacaville didn't play that song.

2128
02:24:48,169 --> 02:24:56,391
[SPEAKER_16]: Anyways, uh, my number one, all together, is doing Spin the Disc, single, heavy, because it works into my main freestyle routine.

2129
02:24:57,231 --> 02:24:59,692
[SPEAKER_16]: So I definitely will have to pick that.

2130
02:25:01,373 --> 02:25:02,373
[SPEAKER_15]: Spin-ta-disc!

2131
02:25:04,315 --> 02:25:06,557
[SPEAKER_15]: Last one, Loki, what is it?

2132
02:25:06,657 --> 02:25:07,678
[SPEAKER_15]: Number one warm-up song.

2133
02:25:07,798 --> 02:25:11,722
[SPEAKER_17]: I played this yesterday, but the pad was fucked up.

2134
02:25:12,162 --> 02:25:13,644
[SPEAKER_17]: This stupid fucking pad.

2135
02:25:14,184 --> 02:25:15,205
[SPEAKER_17]: It's moving on!

2136
02:25:15,866 --> 02:25:16,667
[SPEAKER_17]: Moving on!

2137
02:25:17,547 --> 02:25:18,889
[SPEAKER_17]: Moving on from fifth mix.

2138
02:25:19,229 --> 02:25:23,653
[SPEAKER_17]: It was the only mix it was in, and it was so cool, and they took the... Oh, no...

2139
02:25:36,481 --> 02:25:48,011
[SPEAKER_02]: We have Moonlight Shadow, La Copa De Vida, Cockamamaniac, Miracle Moon Doubles, Superstar, Señorita, It's Raining Men, Share My Love, Little Bitch, Let's Groove, Dropout, Nick, Please Not So Quick, Cloud Girls, Spin The Disc, Whip On

2140
02:25:48,956 --> 02:25:49,516
[SPEAKER_15]: Brad.

2141
02:25:50,337 --> 02:25:52,258
[SPEAKER_15]: Now, songs we forgot.

2142
02:25:53,118 --> 02:25:55,820
[SPEAKER_15]: It didn't hit me until part of the way through when Dave was reminiscing about 4th Mix.

2143
02:25:56,120 --> 02:25:56,980
[SPEAKER_15]: I forgot Bakwa.

2144
02:25:57,500 --> 02:25:59,621
[SPEAKER_15]: That used to be the ultimate warm-up song.

2145
02:25:59,762 --> 02:26:00,462
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, me too.

2146
02:26:00,482 --> 02:26:01,262
[SPEAKER_12]: You know what?

2147
02:26:01,402 --> 02:26:04,124
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm remembering my usual set on 1.5.

2148
02:26:04,364 --> 02:26:06,765
[SPEAKER_02]: It would always start off with Boom Boom Dollar.

2149
02:26:08,006 --> 02:26:08,366
[SPEAKER_02]: Trick.

2150
02:26:09,693 --> 02:26:11,114
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I used to play that a lot, too.

2151
02:26:11,434 --> 02:26:21,380
[SPEAKER_02]: It would always be Boom Boom Dollar, and then My Fire, and then it would be Brilliant COG.

2152
02:26:22,080 --> 02:26:22,360
[SPEAKER_12]: Cool.

2153
02:26:23,181 --> 02:26:31,045
[SPEAKER_12]: No, but I was thinking about doing Synchronized Love, because it's really fun, and it's kind of, but no.

2154
02:26:31,766 --> 02:26:33,347
[SPEAKER_12]: Anyway, so I have to take one off, huh?

2155
02:26:33,707 --> 02:26:33,967
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

2156
02:26:34,467 --> 02:26:36,148
[SPEAKER_12]: Damn, these are all pretty good choices.

2157
02:26:37,249 --> 02:26:38,950
[SPEAKER_12]: And I play them all fairly...

2158
02:26:39,813 --> 02:26:40,313
[SPEAKER_12]: A lot.

2159
02:26:41,374 --> 02:26:41,715
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

2160
02:26:42,395 --> 02:26:47,279
[SPEAKER_12]: But, um... Damn it.

2161
02:26:47,560 --> 02:26:47,860
[SPEAKER_12]: No.

2162
02:26:48,480 --> 02:26:50,782
[SPEAKER_12]: No, I like that song too much.

2163
02:26:51,603 --> 02:26:52,464
[SPEAKER_12]: I think Let's Groove.

2164
02:26:53,845 --> 02:26:55,947
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's Groove goes bye-bye.

2165
02:26:55,967 --> 02:26:56,467
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know.

2166
02:26:57,628 --> 02:27:00,030
[SPEAKER_12]: Too slow and not enough fun.

2167
02:27:00,671 --> 02:27:05,255
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just saying, Let's Groove is sort of one of my cool-down songs if I need to take a breather.

2168
02:27:05,592 --> 02:27:05,832
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know.

2169
02:27:05,852 --> 02:27:07,293
[SPEAKER_15]: It's more of a cool-down than a warm-up.

2170
02:27:08,814 --> 02:27:10,835
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I'd let the beat hit them in the same category.

2171
02:27:11,155 --> 02:27:12,435
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, same.

2172
02:27:12,535 --> 02:27:19,819
[SPEAKER_12]: I do one of those songs in between playing like an extreme edit and doing my PA for Legend of Max qualifier thing.

2173
02:27:20,459 --> 02:27:23,921
[SPEAKER_15]: Anyway, so, these are all pretty good picks.

2174
02:27:24,461 --> 02:27:26,282
[SPEAKER_15]: However, I'm just a bitter little asshole.

2175
02:27:26,302 --> 02:27:27,002
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm taking off dropout.

2176
02:27:29,608 --> 02:27:30,468
[SPEAKER_15]: What the hell are you smoking?

2177
02:27:30,528 --> 02:27:31,349
[SPEAKER_15]: Dropout is a warm-up?

2178
02:27:31,569 --> 02:27:32,509
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, I guess so.

2179
02:27:32,770 --> 02:27:39,013
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, especially, you know, as the bar's kind of been raising and raising, I remember when most people used to go, oh my god, you can pass Dropout Maniac?

2180
02:27:39,053 --> 02:27:41,494
[SPEAKER_15]: And you were like the shit if you could pass Dropout Maniac.

2181
02:27:42,194 --> 02:27:43,755
[SPEAKER_15]: And now it's nothing, you know?

2182
02:27:43,815 --> 02:27:46,176
[SPEAKER_15]: So I can see where it's kind of gone to that level of warm-up.

2183
02:27:46,236 --> 02:27:50,398
[SPEAKER_15]: I know, but I mean, for some people, for some people, I'm saying for the people that it used to be, oh my god.

2184
02:27:50,959 --> 02:27:55,361
[SPEAKER_15]: I know, but I'm saying for the people that it used to be, oh my god, now it's like, you have to be able to pass Max...

2185
02:27:56,561 --> 02:27:57,122
[SPEAKER_15]: 300, Three Speed Shuffle

2186
02:28:26,081 --> 02:28:27,161
[SPEAKER_12]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

2187
02:28:52,765 --> 02:28:53,386
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't care.

2188
02:28:53,406 --> 02:28:57,310
[SPEAKER_02]: It was fun in Samba de Amigo, but sucks for DDR.

2189
02:28:58,010 --> 02:28:59,792
[SPEAKER_12]: Did you see my routine to it?

2190
02:29:00,232 --> 02:29:01,994
[SPEAKER_12]: Where I do the pelvic thrust for the whole song?

2191
02:29:03,696 --> 02:29:05,377
[SPEAKER_12]: Drive you insane, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2192
02:29:07,179 --> 02:29:08,560
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all the more reason for me not to see it.

2193
02:29:09,381 --> 02:29:09,982
[SPEAKER_02]: You're too young.

2194
02:29:11,488 --> 02:29:12,229
[SPEAKER_15]: Moving on!

2195
02:29:14,411 --> 02:29:15,032
[SPEAKER_15]: Zero, oh yeah.

2196
02:29:15,613 --> 02:29:23,641
[SPEAKER_16]: I would probably take on Señorita, because I don't really like a lot of those songs that sound like that on DDR.

2197
02:29:24,482 --> 02:29:25,904
[SPEAKER_16]: Because they just get kind of boring.

2198
02:29:26,164 --> 02:29:28,947
[SPEAKER_15]: Señorita comes off the list, and JB's crying.

2199
02:29:29,267 --> 02:29:32,911
[SPEAKER_16]: One of my old favorite warm-up songs that a lot of people don't like is Lupin the 73rd.

2200
02:29:34,420 --> 02:29:35,841
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know if I consider that a warm-up.

2201
02:29:37,461 --> 02:29:42,283
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, but not the maniac stuff, but the easier, the beginning.

2202
02:29:42,963 --> 02:29:44,364
[SPEAKER_02]: By the way, it's Lupin the Third.

2203
02:29:45,484 --> 02:29:46,484
[SPEAKER_02]: Lupin the Third was anime.

2204
02:29:54,507 --> 02:29:54,847
[SPEAKER_15]: Here we go.

2205
02:29:55,447 --> 02:29:56,388
[SPEAKER_15]: Loki, last one.

2206
02:29:56,488 --> 02:29:56,988
[SPEAKER_15]: What's coming off?

2207
02:29:57,628 --> 02:30:03,973
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, I hate this song on Maniac Doubles, and it can kiss my ass, because that is no six, bitch.

2208
02:30:04,593 --> 02:30:05,494
[SPEAKER_17]: Moonlight Shadow.

2209
02:30:05,914 --> 02:30:07,035
[SPEAKER_15]: Moonlight Shadow?

2210
02:30:08,176 --> 02:30:08,476
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright.

2211
02:30:09,537 --> 02:30:10,517
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, I don't know about a warm-up.

2212
02:30:10,577 --> 02:30:15,761
[SPEAKER_15]: I think the singles, Maniac... Actually, the singles makes a really good warm-up, I think.

2213
02:30:15,961 --> 02:30:18,003
[SPEAKER_17]: You know what we forgot to add onto the list?

2214
02:30:18,263 --> 02:30:18,783
[SPEAKER_15]: What?

2215
02:30:19,364 --> 02:30:20,945
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, oh, Ghost was a good one.

2216
02:30:21,265 --> 02:30:21,706
[SPEAKER_15]: Very well.

2217
02:30:22,906 --> 02:30:23,867
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, you think of them after...

2218
02:30:26,258 --> 02:30:28,719
[SPEAKER_15]: You think of them when you, uh, when it's too late.

2219
02:30:29,759 --> 02:30:31,540
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright, so, there's the list.

2220
02:30:31,580 --> 02:30:34,421
[SPEAKER_15]: Send me your votes right now, now, now.

2221
02:30:34,901 --> 02:30:35,542
[SPEAKER_15]: Jamie, read it.

2222
02:30:36,082 --> 02:30:39,103
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, oh, I was just thinking that people, our people should be in DDR, but nevermind.

2223
02:30:39,703 --> 02:30:49,167
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, Cockamamaniac, Miracle Moon Double, Superstar, It's Rainin' Men, Share My Love, Little Bitch, A Nick Who's Not So Quick, Cowgirl, Spin the Disc, and moving on.

2224
02:30:49,207 --> 02:30:51,127
[SPEAKER_02]: By the way, I was supposed to specify Cowgirl Maniac.

2225
02:30:52,008 --> 02:30:52,548
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, my bad.

2226
02:30:52,808 --> 02:30:53,508
[SPEAKER_15]: And Cock, yeah.

2227
02:30:53,748 --> 02:30:55,249
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh well, people get the idea.

2228
02:30:55,689 --> 02:30:56,410
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, mine are maniac.

2229
02:30:57,290 --> 02:30:57,891
[SPEAKER_02]: So share my love.

[SPEAKER_02]: Vote, bitches.

2233
02:31:02,955 --> 02:31:04,536
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, my dear people.

2234
02:31:04,936 --> 02:31:05,276
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

2235
02:31:05,717 --> 02:31:06,998
[SPEAKER_15]: And in the meantime, we're going to take a break.

2236
02:31:07,018 --> 02:31:08,719
[SPEAKER_15]: So you only have like a minute to send me your votes.

2237
02:31:08,759 --> 02:31:10,981
[SPEAKER_15]: So send them now or we'll boot you from the chat room.

2238
02:31:11,381 --> 02:31:12,101
[SPEAKER_15]: Just kidding, we won't.

2239
02:31:12,141 --> 02:31:13,863
[SPEAKER_15]: But, you know, please participate.

2240
02:31:14,303 --> 02:31:15,144
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's do something old.

2241
02:31:15,524 --> 02:31:16,084
[SPEAKER_15]: Something old?

2242
02:31:16,184 --> 02:31:18,726
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, let's go for Brilliant to UOG.

2243
02:31:19,347 --> 02:31:20,828
[SPEAKER_15]: Brilliant to UOG.

2244
02:31:21,228 --> 02:31:22,109
[SPEAKER_02]: And Boom Boom Dollar.

2245
02:31:22,967 --> 02:31:24,808
[SPEAKER_15]: Brilliant to you, OG, and Boom Boom Dollar.

2246
02:31:24,929 --> 02:31:25,649
[SPEAKER_15]: And Bad Girls.

2247
02:31:25,729 --> 02:31:26,670
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, that's it.

2248
02:31:26,890 --> 02:31:27,651
[SPEAKER_15]: You heard it here.

2249
02:31:27,711 --> 02:31:29,132
[SPEAKER_15]: That's what we're going to hear right now.

2250
02:31:29,152 --> 02:31:36,137
[SPEAKER_15]: We're going to hear Bad Girls, Boom Boom Dollar, and starting off we have Brilliant to you, OG, send me the votes now.

2251
02:31:36,157 --> 02:31:38,359
[SPEAKER_15]: You have until the end of Boom Boom Dollar to do it.

2252
02:31:38,639 --> 02:31:39,780
[SPEAKER_15]: That's when voting's closed.

2253
02:31:40,320 --> 02:31:40,761
[SPEAKER_15]: We'll be back.

2254
02:33:08,089 --> 02:33:10,196
[SPEAKER_07]: Boom, boom, money, signing, dollar

2255
02:35:41,380 --> 02:35:51,227
[SPEAKER_06]: From StepSquad to Orange Labs, this PDR sucks!

2256
02:35:51,828 --> 02:35:52,148
[SPEAKER_06]: Holler!

2257
02:35:52,168 --> 02:35:52,288
[SPEAKER_06]: P.S.

2258
02:35:52,368 --> 02:35:53,109
[SPEAKER_06]: T.T.P.O.

2259
02:35:56,871 --> 02:35:57,452
[SPEAKER_15]: Hi, we're back.

2260
02:35:58,372 --> 02:35:59,373
[SPEAKER_15]: Jamie, you want to do a shout out?

2261
02:36:01,415 --> 02:36:02,055
[SPEAKER_15]: You want to do a shout out?

2262
02:36:02,215 --> 02:36:02,415
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

2263
02:36:03,536 --> 02:36:03,997
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out!

2264
02:36:05,097 --> 02:36:05,318
[SPEAKER_15]: Sorry.

2265
02:36:05,438 --> 02:36:05,598
[SPEAKER_15]: Ow.

2266
02:36:05,758 --> 02:36:05,818
[SPEAKER_15]: Ow.

2267
02:36:07,080 --> 02:36:12,241
[SPEAKER_02]: My shoutout goes to Jahi for staying with me while I was going insane driving around, so thank you.

2268
02:36:12,942 --> 02:36:13,662
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Jahi.

2269
02:36:13,722 --> 02:36:14,582
[SPEAKER_02]: My blood sugar sucks.

2270
02:36:16,222 --> 02:36:16,662
[SPEAKER_15]: Cool.

2271
02:36:17,623 --> 02:36:18,343
[SPEAKER_15]: Jahi is the man.

2272
02:36:18,403 --> 02:36:18,823
[SPEAKER_15]: He's the shit.

2273
02:36:18,843 --> 02:36:19,483
[SPEAKER_02]: He's awesome.

2274
02:36:19,503 --> 02:36:21,544
[SPEAKER_02]: And he has very interesting things to say late at night.

2275
02:36:21,864 --> 02:36:23,084
[SPEAKER_15]: Everybody needs to know a Jahi.

2276
02:36:23,104 --> 02:36:23,904
[SPEAKER_15]: He needs to be on the show.

2277
02:36:24,644 --> 02:36:25,885
[SPEAKER_15]: He needs to be on the show.

2278
02:36:26,305 --> 02:36:26,785
[SPEAKER_15]: Like, here.

2279
02:36:27,918 --> 02:36:29,039
[SPEAKER_15]: He's been via tape.

2280
02:36:29,099 --> 02:36:31,781
[SPEAKER_15]: He's never been here, but hopefully soon, right kids?

2281
02:36:32,361 --> 02:36:34,003
[SPEAKER_15]: He's been talking about moving, maybe.

2282
02:36:34,063 --> 02:36:34,843
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know if that would happen.

2283
02:36:35,424 --> 02:36:36,384
[SPEAKER_15]: During a drunk show.

2284
02:36:36,845 --> 02:36:37,926
[SPEAKER_15]: Maybe you should get him next week.

2285
02:36:38,506 --> 02:36:40,227
[SPEAKER_15]: Jahi would be a suitable replacement for me.

2286
02:36:40,448 --> 02:36:41,709
[SPEAKER_15]: Because, you know, we're so alike.

2287
02:36:42,689 --> 02:36:46,412
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that Jahi would be as difficult to get drunk as me.

2288
02:36:46,432 --> 02:36:48,654
[SPEAKER_17]: That'd be interesting.

2289
02:36:48,734 --> 02:36:49,755
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, it's a three hour show.

2290
02:36:50,415 --> 02:36:51,536
[SPEAKER_02]: A three hour train wreck.

2291
02:36:53,231 --> 02:36:55,057
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright, you want to hear the winners of this list?

2292
02:36:55,097 --> 02:36:55,619
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, you do.

2293
02:36:56,382 --> 02:36:57,646
[SPEAKER_15]: Best warm-up song?

2294
02:36:58,167 --> 02:36:59,211
[SPEAKER_15]: I need drumrolls, people.

2295
02:36:59,311 --> 02:37:00,134
[SPEAKER_15]: Third place!

2296
02:37:02,583 --> 02:37:04,225
[SPEAKER_15]: That's the most unenthusiastic.

2297
02:37:04,465 --> 02:37:05,786
[SPEAKER_15]: That was you slapping yourself.

2298
02:37:05,806 --> 02:37:06,666
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright, applause, whatever.

2299
02:37:06,966 --> 02:37:07,807
[SPEAKER_15]: There you go, there you go.

2300
02:37:08,107 --> 02:37:10,109
[SPEAKER_15]: Third place is... The audience is now deaf.

2301
02:37:10,649 --> 02:37:11,569
[SPEAKER_15]: The audience is horny.

2302
02:37:12,010 --> 02:37:14,732
[SPEAKER_15]: Third place is... Spin the dick.

2303
02:37:15,272 --> 02:37:16,093
[SPEAKER_15]: Spin the disc.

2304
02:37:18,014 --> 02:37:19,355
[SPEAKER_15]: Spin my disc.

2305
02:37:19,475 --> 02:37:21,196
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright, spin the disc is number three winner.

2306
02:37:21,636 --> 02:37:22,977
[SPEAKER_15]: Number two winner is...

2307
02:37:24,578 --> 02:37:30,640
[SPEAKER_15]: Superstar, Wee, and the number one winner, and I must say this even surprised me, but it's beautiful.

2308
02:37:31,840 --> 02:37:36,061
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, Nick, please not so quick, is the number one best DDR warm-up song.

2309
02:37:36,121 --> 02:37:36,822
[SPEAKER_15]: Amazing.

2310
02:37:37,282 --> 02:37:38,182
[SPEAKER_15]: How did that happen?

2311
02:37:38,622 --> 02:37:39,042
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know.

2312
02:37:39,102 --> 02:37:41,143
[SPEAKER_17]: But it is the best DDR warm-up song.

2313
02:37:41,203 --> 02:37:41,983
[SPEAKER_17]: Very close call, though.

2314
02:37:53,101 --> 02:37:56,663
[SPEAKER_15]: More than Jake's very pissy because Little Bitch didn't get in there, but it was very close.

2315
02:37:56,723 --> 02:37:58,984
[SPEAKER_15]: It was very close, but... Sorry.

2316
02:37:59,444 --> 02:38:01,145
[SPEAKER_02]: I just explained something to Zero.

2317
02:38:01,465 --> 02:38:01,585
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

2318
02:38:01,605 --> 02:38:02,586
[SPEAKER_02]: What'd you have to explain?

2319
02:38:02,686 --> 02:38:06,387
[SPEAKER_02]: When you said, oh, Nick, please not so quick, wondering how it got into DVR, I said, so small.

2320
02:38:07,048 --> 02:38:09,129
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, the Chimpoco Mine episode of South Park.

2321
02:38:09,629 --> 02:38:11,530
[SPEAKER_02]: I just explained to Zero what Chimpoco means.

2322
02:38:12,610 --> 02:38:13,571
[SPEAKER_02]: It means small penis.

2323
02:38:16,144 --> 02:38:22,726
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright, so Evil Now Q2DX is celebrating by humping 3rd Korean machines across the United States.

2324
02:38:25,687 --> 02:38:30,809
[SPEAKER_16]: Caution off of whatever version of 3rd it was, 3rd Korean whatever, that was a good song.

2325
02:38:31,209 --> 02:38:33,950
[SPEAKER_15]: No, you know what the best fucking 3rd Korean song is ever?

2326
02:38:34,850 --> 02:38:35,511
[SPEAKER_15]: No, Wah.

2327
02:38:37,351 --> 02:38:38,352
[SPEAKER_02]: Wah is the shit.

2328
02:38:38,692 --> 02:38:39,412
[SPEAKER_02]: No, Wah.

2329
02:38:39,452 --> 02:38:39,772
[SPEAKER_02]: Face.

2330
02:38:41,313 --> 02:38:42,053
[SPEAKER_15]: Face is okay.

2331
02:38:42,523 --> 02:38:44,884
[SPEAKER_02]: By the way, speaking of... No!

2332
02:38:44,964 --> 02:38:45,584
[SPEAKER_15]: Beel!

2333
02:38:46,324 --> 02:38:50,366
[SPEAKER_15]: I remember the fucking guy at Golfland that used to be able to do Beel backwards.

2334
02:38:50,526 --> 02:38:51,687
[SPEAKER_02]: Enrique.

2335
02:38:51,707 --> 02:38:52,747
[SPEAKER_02]: He was one of our originals.

2336
02:38:52,767 --> 02:38:53,747
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I remember that guy.

2337
02:38:54,848 --> 02:38:56,228
[SPEAKER_15]: He used to do Beel backwards.

2338
02:38:56,408 --> 02:38:57,649
[SPEAKER_15]: We'd all go like, ew, Beel.

2339
02:38:57,689 --> 02:38:59,310
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like, oh my god, he can do it backwards.

2340
02:38:59,330 --> 02:39:00,870
[SPEAKER_02]: He would do the perfect boy band dance to it.

2341
02:39:00,930 --> 02:39:01,350
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, he does.

2342
02:39:01,370 --> 02:39:02,291
[SPEAKER_15]: He had a perfect boy band dance.

2343
02:39:02,471 --> 02:39:02,911
[SPEAKER_15]: That was great.

2344
02:39:04,847 --> 02:39:05,127
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, okay.

2345
02:39:05,368 --> 02:39:06,809
[SPEAKER_02]: That just stopped the show down the track.

2346
02:39:06,829 --> 02:39:07,489
[SPEAKER_15]: That's alright.

2347
02:39:07,990 --> 02:39:09,271
[SPEAKER_15]: We're reminiscing about Beul.

2348
02:39:09,311 --> 02:39:11,073
[SPEAKER_15]: That's when you know we're desperate for material.

2349
02:39:11,393 --> 02:39:13,475
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, and now we should do our other favorite segment.

2350
02:39:13,715 --> 02:39:14,015
[SPEAKER_15]: What?

2351
02:39:15,116 --> 02:39:16,377
[SPEAKER_02]: Ask Orange Lounge!

2352
02:39:16,417 --> 02:39:18,339
[SPEAKER_15]: Haven't we beat this segment to the ground?

2353
02:39:18,379 --> 02:39:19,620
[SPEAKER_15]: Haven't they asked all their questions?

2354
02:39:20,080 --> 02:39:21,201
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's just story time with Loki.

2355
02:39:21,241 --> 02:39:21,722
[SPEAKER_15]: You have a story?

2356
02:39:23,143 --> 02:39:27,104
[SPEAKER_15]: It's something that reminded me... Alright, great, we get to do Storytime with Loki.

2357
02:39:27,405 --> 02:39:31,507
[SPEAKER_15]: If we can do a really quick Ask Orange Orange to me.

2358
02:39:31,587 --> 02:39:32,607
[SPEAKER_15]: How about this?

2359
02:39:32,627 --> 02:39:36,229
[SPEAKER_17]: Sir, send in questions, and it'll be a really quick story.

2360
02:39:36,609 --> 02:39:41,151
[SPEAKER_17]: And it's unfortunately not porn-related, so... Aww, what fun is that?

2361
02:39:41,171 --> 02:39:41,912
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm sorry!

2362
02:39:42,512 --> 02:39:44,913
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright, so... I was just going to talk about how retarded Q's are, player.

2363
02:39:44,973 --> 02:39:50,456
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know, what are we going to... Let's... Storytime with Loki, what... I know, but that's our...

2364
02:39:52,462 --> 02:39:52,982
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, whatever.

2365
02:39:53,042 --> 02:39:53,643
[SPEAKER_17]: It doesn't matter.

2366
02:39:53,663 --> 02:39:55,343
[SPEAKER_17]: This is going to be so quick anyways.

2367
02:39:55,543 --> 02:39:55,863
[SPEAKER_17]: We'll do it.

2368
02:39:55,883 --> 02:39:56,524
[SPEAKER_17]: We'll do this one.

2369
02:39:56,544 --> 02:39:57,084
[SPEAKER_17]: This will be funny.

2370
02:39:58,244 --> 02:39:58,625
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, anyways.

2371
02:39:58,965 --> 02:40:00,405
[SPEAKER_17]: So let me go ahead and just start anyways.

2372
02:40:01,346 --> 02:40:04,487
[SPEAKER_17]: I was going to tell you guys about this one person we used to play Cuesar with.

2373
02:40:04,507 --> 02:40:11,330
[SPEAKER_17]: Now, this woman is like... She had to be in her 30s, if not older, in her 40s or something like that.

2374
02:40:11,430 --> 02:40:12,870
[SPEAKER_17]: And she's still playing Cuesar.

2375
02:40:12,950 --> 02:40:14,731
[SPEAKER_17]: And she was like, this is what happens...

2376
02:40:16,522 --> 02:40:21,824
[SPEAKER_17]: This is what happens when... This is what happens when retarded people grow up.

2377
02:40:22,585 --> 02:40:22,865
[SPEAKER_17]: Alright?

2378
02:40:23,165 --> 02:40:26,447
[SPEAKER_17]: And they serve no purpose in society other than just to annoy you.

2379
02:40:27,147 --> 02:40:31,829
[SPEAKER_17]: So this bitch, looking to find where she fit in, she thought she fit in with Cusar.

2380
02:40:32,669 --> 02:40:33,730
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, she was terribly wrong.

2381
02:40:33,750 --> 02:40:39,993
[SPEAKER_17]: She sucked ass, she's played for like five years, and the reason she likes playing is because the packs vibrate.

2382
02:40:42,037 --> 02:40:44,480
[SPEAKER_17]: And she liked vibrating packs.

2383
02:40:44,580 --> 02:40:53,270
[SPEAKER_17]: And she would only, and she got pissed off and would, we'd shoot her up, which we'd always use the, you know, aggro, like hell, you know, because she was retarded.

2384
02:40:55,883 --> 02:40:56,804
[SPEAKER_17]: That's not nice!

2385
02:40:57,684 --> 02:41:01,705
[SPEAKER_17]: And that's my story, and that's it.

2386
02:41:03,806 --> 02:41:08,947
[SPEAKER_17]: That's my story, and she bought a pack and built her own little mini arena in her house, and she sucks.

2387
02:41:09,827 --> 02:41:11,108
[SPEAKER_17]: And her name was ZapZap.

2388
02:41:11,288 --> 02:41:12,488
[SPEAKER_17]: Her husband's name was ZipZip.

2389
02:41:18,151 --> 02:41:21,034
[SPEAKER_15]: I get to go to a bachelor party at some point, I think in the next few months, so we'll have some definite stories from that.

2390
02:41:21,054 --> 02:41:22,695
Can you take something from me?

2391
02:41:22,715 --> 02:41:23,856
[SPEAKER_15]: What's the thing you have behind your back?

2392
02:41:23,876 --> 02:41:24,036
[SPEAKER_15]: Show me.

2393
02:41:24,056 --> 02:41:24,557
[SPEAKER_15]: Show me.

2394
02:41:46,592 --> 02:41:53,536
[SPEAKER_15]: What do you have behind your back?

2395
02:41:53,556 --> 02:41:56,838
[SPEAKER_15]: Show me.

2396
02:41:57,238 --> 02:41:59,139
[SPEAKER_15]: What'd you take out of my pocket?

2397
02:41:59,419 --> 02:42:03,562
[SPEAKER_15]: What were you doing?

2398
02:42:03,582 --> 02:42:05,043
[SPEAKER_15]: You're not nice.

2399
02:42:11,407 --> 02:42:12,728
[SPEAKER_02]: That was smooth and deadly.

2400
02:42:17,145 --> 02:42:18,026
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't smoke.

2401
02:42:18,086 --> 02:42:20,007
[SPEAKER_02]: Smoking is bad for you, kids.

2402
02:42:20,027 --> 02:42:21,327
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah, y'all are funny, huh?

2403
02:42:40,515 --> 02:42:41,916
[SPEAKER_15]: These cigarettes have been down your legs?

2404
02:42:43,638 --> 02:42:43,999
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright.

2405
02:42:44,119 --> 02:42:45,140
[SPEAKER_02]: Tastes like crack.

2406
02:42:45,200 --> 02:42:48,523
[SPEAKER_15]: Quite a few questions tonight for Ask Orange Lounge, so let's get to it.

2407
02:42:48,583 --> 02:42:49,224
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm surprised.

2408
02:42:49,284 --> 02:42:50,946
[SPEAKER_15]: Usually I have to berate people for questions.

2409
02:42:52,667 --> 02:42:54,809
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright, kiddies, it's time for that segment.

2410
02:42:56,437 --> 02:42:58,238
[SPEAKER_15]: Tell us about Ask Orange Lounge, Jamie.

2411
02:42:59,438 --> 02:43:00,318
[SPEAKER_15]: Basically, I'm buying time.

2412
02:43:00,398 --> 02:43:01,219
[SPEAKER_02]: Ask us a question.

2413
02:43:02,219 --> 02:43:04,680
[SPEAKER_02]: You might get an answer, but you might not always like what you hear.

2414
02:43:05,340 --> 02:43:09,081
[SPEAKER_17]: This segment was born from the fact that we've run out of things to talk about.

2415
02:43:09,381 --> 02:43:14,623
[SPEAKER_17]: And so we rely on you, the audience, to, you know, kind of jumpstart the show again.

2416
02:43:17,204 --> 02:43:18,665
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, that wasn't a question.

2417
02:43:18,685 --> 02:43:20,185
[SPEAKER_15]: I was excited.

2418
02:43:20,565 --> 02:43:22,966
[SPEAKER_02]: You must ask a question in the form of a walrus.

2419
02:43:22,986 --> 02:43:23,426
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's see.

2420
02:43:23,566 --> 02:43:24,206
[SPEAKER_15]: More than Jake543, uh...

2421
02:43:26,480 --> 02:43:28,561
[SPEAKER_15]: What do they do, they do, they do love me?

2422
02:43:28,761 --> 02:43:30,241
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't like scary stalkers.

2423
02:43:31,321 --> 02:43:34,142
[SPEAKER_02]: They just make themselves in the self-love.

2424
02:43:34,162 --> 02:43:35,982
[SPEAKER_02]: They're admitting to being public masturbators.

2425
02:43:36,483 --> 02:43:37,023
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, okay.

2426
02:43:37,863 --> 02:43:39,483
[SPEAKER_15]: Like Creamy, you know that song, I do, I do, I do?

2427
02:43:39,563 --> 02:43:40,024
[SPEAKER_15]: What are they doing?

2428
02:43:40,044 --> 02:43:40,984
[SPEAKER_02]: Where did they get their name from?

2429
02:43:41,004 --> 02:43:41,564
[SPEAKER_02]: They're all Creamy.

2430
02:43:42,764 --> 02:43:45,305
[SPEAKER_15]: By the way, you know they're like a couple of 16-year-old girls, right, Creamy?

2431
02:43:45,385 --> 02:43:45,565
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

2432
02:43:49,443 --> 02:43:51,485
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, I make them creamy.

2433
02:43:51,625 --> 02:43:52,706
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a question for you, Rob.

2434
02:43:52,806 --> 02:43:53,046
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

2435
02:43:53,627 --> 02:43:55,328
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes you just feel not so fresh.

2436
02:43:56,569 --> 02:43:57,190
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, right now.

2437
02:43:59,412 --> 02:44:02,054
[SPEAKER_15]: And he also wants to know, hey, what's that rash from?

2438
02:44:04,276 --> 02:44:04,737
[SPEAKER_02]: Dry rot.

2439
02:44:06,638 --> 02:44:06,818
[SPEAKER_15]: Ew.

2440
02:44:07,559 --> 02:44:08,380
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright, dry rot.

2441
02:44:09,850 --> 02:44:10,390
[SPEAKER_15]: Moving on.

2442
02:44:10,871 --> 02:44:12,252
[SPEAKER_15]: EOSFBB has a question.

2443
02:44:13,913 --> 02:44:18,116
[SPEAKER_15]: Previously on Orange Lounge Radio, I recall somebody mentioning Chocolate Cool Whip.

2444
02:44:18,456 --> 02:44:23,480
[SPEAKER_15]: However, when I went to my local supermarket, they didn't have it, and the Cool Whip website didn't have it either.

2445
02:44:23,560 --> 02:44:26,682
[SPEAKER_15]: Can you confirm the existence of Chocolate Cool Whip?

2446
02:44:26,882 --> 02:44:28,943
[SPEAKER_02]: I can indeed, because I used to buy it in Medioc.

2447
02:44:29,824 --> 02:44:31,665
[SPEAKER_02]: It may only be sold in these customers.

2448
02:44:31,926 --> 02:44:35,868
[SPEAKER_02]: But what I bought at Ralph's was Chocolate Ready Whip in the spray can.

2449
02:44:35,908 --> 02:44:36,048
[SPEAKER_02]: The...

2450
02:44:37,369 --> 02:44:41,313
[SPEAKER_15]: Ah, so, okay, so Chocolate Ready Whip is what you can easily find out.

2451
02:44:41,694 --> 02:44:46,498
[SPEAKER_15]: Now, I have seen Chocolate Cool Whip, except I don't know if it was Chocolate Cool Whip.

2452
02:44:46,538 --> 02:44:48,100
[SPEAKER_15]: I think it was Chocolate Generic Cool Whip.

2453
02:44:48,120 --> 02:44:48,861
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it was Chocolate Cool Whip.

2454
02:44:48,881 --> 02:44:49,301
[SPEAKER_15]: Really, okay.

2455
02:44:49,321 --> 02:44:50,702
[SPEAKER_15]: Interesting.

2456
02:44:50,903 --> 02:44:51,803
[SPEAKER_02]: It may be discontinued.

2457
02:44:51,824 --> 02:44:52,444
[SPEAKER_02]: This was a few years ago.

2458
02:44:53,005 --> 02:44:55,387
[SPEAKER_15]: I'd like to know what EOSFVB is going to be doing with Chocolate Cool Whip.

2459
02:44:55,807 --> 02:44:56,608
[SPEAKER_02]: But I was just with it.

2460
02:44:57,609 --> 02:44:58,770
[SPEAKER_02]: I was making ice cream.

2461
02:44:58,830 --> 02:44:59,991
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a creme brulee and I was bored.

2462
02:45:00,011 --> 02:45:01,032
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2463
02:45:02,506 --> 02:45:07,911
[SPEAKER_15]: Also, EOSFBB asks, where can I find females to say something for my porno music I made?

2464
02:45:08,251 --> 02:45:12,654
[SPEAKER_15]: These things need to be said sensually through the word I've been using is orgasmically.

2465
02:45:13,575 --> 02:45:17,558
[SPEAKER_15]: Always, all that I've asked have declined mentioning that they were not whores.

2466
02:45:18,339 --> 02:45:22,202
[SPEAKER_17]: Offer to pay them money to say this word, and then be like, okay.

2467
02:45:22,222 --> 02:45:23,704
[SPEAKER_15]: What's the word?

2468
02:45:23,924 --> 02:45:25,525
[SPEAKER_15]: My suggestion... What's the word?

2469
02:45:26,366 --> 02:45:28,768
[SPEAKER_15]: Orgasmically, I don't... I'd close the window.

2470
02:45:29,308 --> 02:45:31,370
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know, he just needs dirty phrases said.

2471
02:45:35,267 --> 02:45:37,629
[SPEAKER_15]: I would say, honestly, my suggestion, Yahoo.

2472
02:45:38,169 --> 02:45:39,630
[SPEAKER_15]: There's tons of freaks on Yahoo.

2473
02:45:42,192 --> 02:45:43,673
[SPEAKER_15]: Go to Yahoo.

2474
02:45:43,713 --> 02:45:45,254
[SPEAKER_15]: You'll find women that'll do anything on Yahoo.

2475
02:45:45,274 --> 02:45:49,637
[SPEAKER_15]: Take that money, rent some pornos, and rip audio from them.

2476
02:45:50,338 --> 02:45:50,638
[SPEAKER_15]: I know.

2477
02:45:51,198 --> 02:45:51,719
[SPEAKER_15]: This will work.

2478
02:45:52,139 --> 02:45:53,760
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not boner, it's boner.

2479
02:45:53,780 --> 02:45:56,082
[SPEAKER_15]: No, I have the bona fide trick that'll work for you, SFEB.

2480
02:45:56,920 --> 02:46:00,082
[SPEAKER_15]: Tell the women you're gay, because then they'll do anything for you.

2481
02:46:00,682 --> 02:46:01,503
[SPEAKER_15]: They really will.

2482
02:46:03,164 --> 02:46:04,305
[SPEAKER_02]: Then he'll never get a date again.

2483
02:46:05,185 --> 02:46:14,251
[SPEAKER_15]: But no, because then you go, oh gosh, you know, as much as I love, you know, anal sex and blowjobs, I really want to try a pussy someday.

2484
02:46:14,291 --> 02:46:16,952
[SPEAKER_15]: And then all the women will go, oh, me, me, me, I'll help you out.

2485
02:46:18,173 --> 02:46:18,513
[SPEAKER_17]: Really?

2486
02:46:18,533 --> 02:46:20,254
[SPEAKER_17]: I'll have to remember that if I ever become single again.

2487
02:46:21,860 --> 02:46:26,241
[SPEAKER_17]: Phil, you know, I'm, like, gay and all, but would you, like, suck my cock?

2488
02:46:26,642 --> 02:46:27,642
[SPEAKER_17]: Would that work?

2489
02:46:30,063 --> 02:46:34,844
[SPEAKER_17]: I'll just pretend you're a guy, and, yeah.

2490
02:46:35,244 --> 02:46:36,345
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, moving on.

2491
02:46:36,385 --> 02:46:39,386
[SPEAKER_02]: Last week's Orange Lounge.

2492
02:46:41,967 --> 02:46:47,448
[SPEAKER_15]: EvilNauki2DSX asks the question, Why are there no poppin' music machines in NorCal?

2493
02:46:48,229 --> 02:46:48,809
[SPEAKER_02]: Because we suck.

2494
02:46:50,856 --> 02:46:53,158
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you get hemorrhoids the size of melons?

2495
02:47:16,076 --> 02:47:18,818
[SPEAKER_02]: You get really constipated and then try to take a big shit.

2496
02:47:20,159 --> 02:47:27,784
[SPEAKER_02]: Eventually, after having a whole life of nothing but bad constipation and trying to push your intestines out through your ass, you'll grow a hemorrhoid.

2497
02:47:28,804 --> 02:47:29,305
[SPEAKER_15]: Beautiful!

2498
02:47:30,065 --> 02:47:31,126
[SPEAKER_02]: Also work a desk job.

2499
02:47:35,329 --> 02:47:35,689
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright.

2500
02:47:37,870 --> 02:47:44,135
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, I know this because I was looking up stuff on the internet, medical stuff, and I found hemorrhoid advice.

2501
02:47:44,215 --> 02:47:44,575
[SPEAKER_15]: Beautiful.

2502
02:47:45,219 --> 02:47:51,481
[SPEAKER_15]: Vidpower asks, will my American PlayStation 2 peripherals work on a Japanese PlayStation 2 and vice versa?

2503
02:47:52,001 --> 02:47:55,783
[SPEAKER_15]: Will his American PlayStation 2 peripherals work on a Japanese PlayStation 2 and vice versa?

2504
02:47:56,183 --> 02:47:56,403
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

2505
02:47:56,983 --> 02:47:57,563
[SPEAKER_02]: Goddamn.

2506
02:47:58,183 --> 02:48:03,385
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I've been using a Japanese NetCon for like years to play Wipeout on my American PlayStation.

2507
02:48:04,306 --> 02:48:05,106
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah.

2508
02:48:05,446 --> 02:48:07,367
[SPEAKER_15]: And he also wants to know, do we Yahoo?

2509
02:48:09,909 --> 02:48:15,012
[SPEAKER_15]: I would like to say once again the email address if you ever want to send your comments or suggestions to Orange Lounge Radio.

2510
02:48:15,092 --> 02:48:22,336
[SPEAKER_15]: Yahoo.com Orange Lounge Radio at Yahoo.com Yahoo!

2511
02:48:22,436 --> 02:48:24,678
[SPEAKER_15]: 23rd Magus wants to know, original or extra crispy?

2512
02:48:27,659 --> 02:48:28,660
[SPEAKER_15]: Extra Crispy, bitch.

2513
02:48:29,800 --> 02:48:31,462
[SPEAKER_15]: I would vote Extra Crispy as well, sorry.

2514
02:48:32,262 --> 02:48:35,004
[SPEAKER_02]: Then again, if I get chicken, I usually pull all the skin off of it anyway.

2515
02:48:35,024 --> 02:48:38,066
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't eat that crap, you know?

2516
02:48:38,366 --> 02:48:39,607
[SPEAKER_02]: You know how bad that crap's for you?

2517
02:48:39,627 --> 02:48:41,849
[SPEAKER_02]: It's nothing but flour and grease.

2518
02:48:43,330 --> 02:48:44,831
[SPEAKER_15]: Mmm, mmm, grease.

2519
02:48:46,051 --> 02:48:46,412
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

2520
02:48:47,192 --> 02:48:50,074
[SPEAKER_15]: Also, 23Romangos has a specific question for Loki.

2521
02:48:50,754 --> 02:48:54,237
[SPEAKER_15]: Loki, what would you do with two quiet Jap girls and a bucket of chocolate ready whip?

2522
02:48:55,836 --> 02:48:57,277
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't like chocolate ready whip.

2523
02:48:58,217 --> 02:49:01,659
[SPEAKER_17]: No, if we're talking regular ready whip, that's a whole different story.

2524
02:49:03,420 --> 02:49:07,402
[SPEAKER_17]: I would have them perform a wonderful little strip tease while I eat ice cream.

2525
02:49:16,987 --> 02:49:19,468
[SPEAKER_17]: It's two things I enjoy, strip teases and ice cream.

2526
02:49:19,508 --> 02:49:20,909
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my god, Rob, you're matching your shirt.

2527
02:49:21,866 --> 02:49:24,887
[SPEAKER_02]: Rob's wearing this lovely red shirt that says, I hate myself and I want to die.

2528
02:49:25,907 --> 02:49:26,908
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's matching it now.

2529
02:49:27,808 --> 02:49:28,788
[SPEAKER_15]: It's my Nakari shirt.

2530
02:49:29,389 --> 02:49:29,949
[SPEAKER_15]: You're glowing.

2531
02:49:32,190 --> 02:49:36,631
[SPEAKER_15]: That was quite possibly the funniest thing that's ever been said on this program, in my opinion.

2532
02:49:37,151 --> 02:49:38,212
[SPEAKER_02]: I would watch guys do that.

2533
02:49:38,772 --> 02:49:39,192
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

2534
02:49:40,472 --> 02:49:41,413
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, now Loki.

2535
02:49:42,433 --> 02:49:43,353
[SPEAKER_15]: 23rd Mega says another question.

2536
02:49:44,094 --> 02:49:47,495
[SPEAKER_15]: I do want to know, why don't they serve ice cream in a fucking strip club?

2537
02:49:48,542 --> 02:49:49,103
[SPEAKER_13]: Why don't they?

2538
02:49:50,023 --> 02:49:51,825
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, let's open up a strip club.

2539
02:49:51,845 --> 02:49:54,527
[SPEAKER_15]: And it'll be ice cream and boobs.

2540
02:49:56,289 --> 02:49:57,590
[SPEAKER_02]: I want ice cream and dick.

2541
02:49:59,592 --> 02:50:01,813
[SPEAKER_15]: And on Wednesday could be like banana split night.

2542
02:50:01,894 --> 02:50:03,635
[SPEAKER_15]: And they serve spotted dick.

2543
02:50:05,336 --> 02:50:05,497
[SPEAKER_17]: What?

2544
02:50:05,557 --> 02:50:07,358
[SPEAKER_17]: It's a British delicacy.

2545
02:50:07,578 --> 02:50:11,161
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to make phallic sundaes.

2546
02:50:12,022 --> 02:50:14,785
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to come up with desserts that look like, you know...

2547
02:50:16,466 --> 02:50:17,267
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, man.

2548
02:50:17,287 --> 02:50:20,068
[SPEAKER_17]: It's just like, they serve all this greasy food and you feel sick to your stomach.

2549
02:50:20,088 --> 02:50:22,770
[SPEAKER_17]: You want something, like, comforting like ice cream.

2550
02:50:42,013 --> 02:50:43,574
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, anyways, what's the other question?

2551
02:50:43,594 --> 02:50:47,436
[SPEAKER_15]: The other question is, what would Rob do with two quiet Jap girls and a bucket of chocolate ready whip?

2552
02:50:48,437 --> 02:50:49,938
[SPEAKER_15]: But he's asking you what I would do.

2553
02:50:50,038 --> 02:50:50,738
[SPEAKER_17]: What you would do?

2554
02:50:51,939 --> 02:50:52,559
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't know.

2555
02:50:53,099 --> 02:50:58,343
[SPEAKER_17]: You'd send the girls over to Matt's house and... I know what Rob would do.

2556
02:50:59,644 --> 02:51:02,866
[SPEAKER_02]: He would just have them stand there with their boobs out and eat the ice cream.

2557
02:51:02,906 --> 02:51:04,767
[SPEAKER_02]: Because Rob likes boobs.

2558
02:51:06,033 --> 02:51:12,775
[SPEAKER_15]: DarkTetsuya wants to know, you think the arcade would be a good place to find a girl?

2559
02:51:25,874 --> 02:51:31,676
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, I met a guy who I dated for about a month when I worked in an arcade.

2560
02:51:32,236 --> 02:51:39,738
[SPEAKER_17]: Alright, I should let you finish your story, but anyways, I was going to say, meet women where you like to meet.

2561
02:51:39,938 --> 02:51:47,580
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, basically, like, say for instance, you're in the arcades or that kind of stuff, or you're into this, you'll find people that are into the same kind of stuff in those places, you know?

2562
02:51:48,140 --> 02:51:49,201
[SPEAKER_17]: Just not home.

2563
02:51:49,261 --> 02:51:50,102
[SPEAKER_15]: Don't meet women at home.

2564
02:51:50,122 --> 02:51:51,583
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, don't meet women at home.

2565
02:51:51,663 --> 02:51:53,224
[SPEAKER_15]: Even if you like to be home, don't meet women at home.

2566
02:51:53,244 --> 02:51:59,450
[SPEAKER_02]: Online is sort of okay, because nowadays you can kind of find out... I met Dan, and we're celebrating our five-year anniversary this Friday.

2567
02:52:00,671 --> 02:52:04,594
[SPEAKER_17]: But, no, if online's alright... It's just risky.

2568
02:52:04,714 --> 02:52:05,475
[SPEAKER_17]: Online's risky.

2569
02:52:05,635 --> 02:52:06,956
[SPEAKER_17]: Jamie took a gamble and she won.

2570
02:52:07,156 --> 02:52:08,998
[SPEAKER_17]: Online, yeah, online's kind of risky.

2571
02:52:09,318 --> 02:52:12,060
[SPEAKER_17]: Now, if you happen to be within, like, say, the 18 to 21-year-old range...

2572
02:52:14,182 --> 02:52:20,487
[SPEAKER_17]: I happen to know, because I was looking for my friend, my friend, um, Sean, okay, on Yahoo, the personals.

2573
02:52:20,667 --> 02:52:22,849
[SPEAKER_17]: Man, there's some crazy people out there.

2574
02:52:22,869 --> 02:52:28,093
[SPEAKER_17]: There's some women that are damn hot, and they're like, you know, wanting people to go out with them.

2575
02:52:28,473 --> 02:52:31,815
[SPEAKER_17]: Except for the one chick, because she was, uh, her best friends were her parents.

2576
02:52:32,816 --> 02:52:35,838
[SPEAKER_17]: But she was hot, so I feel like I'd overlook that, just for that.

2577
02:52:37,159 --> 02:52:37,640
[SPEAKER_17]: Seriously.

2578
02:52:37,900 --> 02:52:38,540
[SPEAKER_02]: Go to college.

2579
02:52:39,281 --> 02:52:40,041
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, college.

2580
02:52:40,061 --> 02:52:40,462
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, definitely.

2581
02:52:40,482 --> 02:52:41,082
[SPEAKER_02]: Go to college.

2582
02:52:41,563 --> 02:52:42,523
[SPEAKER_17]: College, yeah.

2583
02:52:45,351 --> 02:52:46,852
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, next question.

2584
02:52:46,872 --> 02:52:47,913
[SPEAKER_15]: That's good advice.

2585
02:52:48,813 --> 02:52:49,834
[SPEAKER_15]: Find women where you like to be.

2586
02:52:50,875 --> 02:52:53,676
[SPEAKER_15]: Angel says, just a side question really, did you ever find the ferret?

2587
02:52:54,657 --> 02:52:55,337
[SPEAKER_15]: No, we didn't.

2588
02:52:55,458 --> 02:52:56,938
[SPEAKER_15]: I didn't even think to look for it this week.

2589
02:52:57,739 --> 02:53:01,701
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm going to be cleaning up this room pretty good the next couple days because I promised Brian I would.

2590
02:53:01,882 --> 02:53:02,302
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, shut up.

2591
02:53:03,062 --> 02:53:04,103
[SPEAKER_15]: So we'll see if we find it.

2592
02:53:04,723 --> 02:53:06,464
[SPEAKER_15]: But no, we haven't found it yet, amazingly enough.

2593
02:53:06,484 --> 02:53:08,966
[SPEAKER_02]: I found Game Boy games from the store.

2594
02:53:08,986 --> 02:53:10,647
[SPEAKER_15]: The games aren't actually in there, it's just the boxes.

2595
02:53:10,987 --> 02:53:11,788
[SPEAKER_02]: And whatever this is.

2596
02:53:12,600 --> 02:53:13,921
[SPEAKER_15]: It's conversion for the mouse.

2597
02:53:13,981 --> 02:53:15,083
[SPEAKER_15]: Anyway, moving on.

2598
02:53:16,484 --> 02:53:18,306
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see what's in Rob's drawers.

2599
02:53:18,586 --> 02:53:18,906
[SPEAKER_15]: No.

2600
02:53:21,549 --> 02:53:22,910
[SPEAKER_15]: More than Jake wants to know.

2601
02:53:22,971 --> 02:53:24,392
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm not going to tell the dead baby joke.

2602
02:53:24,412 --> 02:53:25,333
[SPEAKER_15]: That was so two weeks ago.

2603
02:53:25,773 --> 02:53:27,095
[SPEAKER_15]: What would you do for a Klondike bar?

2604
02:53:28,636 --> 02:53:30,438
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, go to the store and buy one.

2605
02:53:30,478 --> 02:53:33,300
[SPEAKER_15]: I know, go to the store, put a dollar on the counter and say, Give me a Klondike bar!

2606
02:53:33,600 --> 02:53:33,980
[SPEAKER_02]: Bitch!

2607
02:53:34,901 --> 02:53:35,041
[SPEAKER_15]: Ah.

2608
02:53:35,481 --> 02:53:36,863
[SPEAKER_02]: I know you got a Klondike bar!

2609
02:53:37,183 --> 02:53:37,943
[SPEAKER_02]: And nice titties!

2610
02:53:38,904 --> 02:53:40,946
[SPEAKER_17]: I have sex with a very fine Asian woman.

2611
02:53:41,986 --> 02:53:47,831
[SPEAKER_15]: DDArk, DDArkoholic wants to know, boxers... Oh, you found the ferret!

2612
02:53:50,273 --> 02:53:51,714
[SPEAKER_15]: Yay, we have found the ferret.

2613
02:53:51,834 --> 02:53:52,134
[SPEAKER_15]: Hooray.

2614
02:53:52,775 --> 02:53:54,416
[SPEAKER_15]: It was way up there, it almost fell behind the thing.

2615
02:53:54,876 --> 02:53:57,038
[SPEAKER_15]: Uh, DDArkoholic wants to know, boxers or briefs?

2616
02:53:57,418 --> 02:53:58,139
[SPEAKER_15]: We'll start with Jamie.

2617
02:53:59,973 --> 02:54:00,494
[SPEAKER_06]: What do you like?

2618
02:54:00,654 --> 02:54:01,375
[SPEAKER_15]: No, what do you like to wear?

2619
02:54:01,936 --> 02:54:02,737
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just kidding.

2620
02:54:03,778 --> 02:54:06,241
[SPEAKER_02]: Nothing.

2621
02:54:06,541 --> 02:54:15,813
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, I like... I would say in general, I prefer briefs on a guy, because they show more.

2622
02:54:17,335 --> 02:54:19,337
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, the boxers need more accessibility.

2623
02:54:19,817 --> 02:54:25,282
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, there was this one time where my friend's boyfriend was asleep in her bed in her dorm room.

2624
02:54:26,183 --> 02:54:29,465
[SPEAKER_02]: And I turned back to say something to her and his flight was totally open.

2625
02:54:30,446 --> 02:54:32,908
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, you need to leave him because he's really tight.

2626
02:54:34,169 --> 02:54:35,070
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my god!

2627
02:54:35,170 --> 02:54:37,012
[SPEAKER_02]: I used to go in their dorm room and sniff the air.

2628
02:54:38,053 --> 02:54:39,474
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, oh, you just got done.

2629
02:54:39,554 --> 02:54:40,255
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going out now.

2630
02:54:45,663 --> 02:54:51,210
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I would go in, it would be like in the morning, I would go in and say hi, because I would just go over there and hang out.

2631
02:54:51,591 --> 02:54:55,576
[SPEAKER_02]: But if it had that particular sponsor.

2632
02:54:55,717 --> 02:54:56,658
[SPEAKER_02]: This smells like humping.

2633
02:54:56,738 --> 02:54:57,980
[SPEAKER_15]: Moving on, who wants to go next?

2634
02:55:01,149 --> 02:55:02,110
[SPEAKER_17]: I wear both, actually.

2635
02:55:02,170 --> 02:55:03,031
[SPEAKER_17]: Not at the same time.

2636
02:55:03,312 --> 02:55:03,992
[SPEAKER_17]: That'd be weird.

2637
02:55:05,054 --> 02:55:05,674
[SPEAKER_17]: It just depends.

2638
02:55:06,115 --> 02:55:16,727
[SPEAKER_17]: Boxers are comfortable to sleeve in and stuff, but when you're playing DDR or something like that, you don't exactly want... I don't like boxers because they end up riding up into your ass.

2639
02:55:17,287 --> 02:55:20,391
[SPEAKER_17]: Especially when you're working out or some shit like that.

2640
02:55:20,491 --> 02:55:21,452
[SPEAKER_17]: That pisses me off.

2641
02:55:22,673 --> 02:55:25,615
[SPEAKER_17]: But then again, more accessibility, that's always good.

2642
02:55:26,696 --> 02:55:30,458
[SPEAKER_17]: And my girlfriend looks hot in boxers.

2643
02:55:30,618 --> 02:55:33,900
[SPEAKER_17]: Actually, women look hot in boxers.

2644
02:55:34,040 --> 02:55:39,003
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember the 80s, though, when it was really popular for girls to wear men's boxers?

2645
02:55:39,143 --> 02:55:40,844
[SPEAKER_02]: It's still popular, man.

2646
02:55:40,904 --> 02:55:42,705
[SPEAKER_17]: Boxers and a short cut-off shirt.

2647
02:55:42,965 --> 02:55:43,445
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, yeah.

2648
02:55:43,605 --> 02:55:49,049
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to say, though, that getting an oversized pair of men's boxers are the most comfortable thing to sleep in.

2649
02:55:49,069 --> 02:55:50,309
[SPEAKER_02]: Really comfortable.

2650
02:55:51,030 --> 02:55:51,430
[SPEAKER_14]: Moving on.

2651
02:55:53,806 --> 02:56:00,849
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, um, on me, I particularly like boxers, but on a girl, see, I'd have to flip it around, and I would say Kong.

2652
02:56:00,889 --> 02:56:01,789
[SPEAKER_16]: That's all I got to say.

2653
02:56:03,770 --> 02:56:09,112
[SPEAKER_02]: Um... To that note, what's so good about walking around with a wedgie?

2654
02:56:10,252 --> 02:56:10,533
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

2655
02:56:12,073 --> 02:56:14,694
[SPEAKER_15]: Uh, as for me, neither!

2656
02:56:15,054 --> 02:56:15,735
[SPEAKER_15]: Ha ha ha!

2657
02:56:16,295 --> 02:56:20,116
[SPEAKER_15]: No, um, boxers, you get wedgies too easily, so reason.

2658
02:56:20,196 --> 02:56:20,837
[SPEAKER_17]: Or boxer reason.

2659
02:56:22,580 --> 02:56:25,621
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll go ahead and speak for Dan, because I'm sure he would say this.

2660
02:56:25,641 --> 02:56:25,881
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.

2661
02:56:26,462 --> 02:56:30,663
[SPEAKER_02]: He wears briefs, because he prefers security.

2662
02:56:31,444 --> 02:56:32,664
[SPEAKER_02]: But they make these boxer briefs.

2663
02:56:33,905 --> 02:56:34,525
[SPEAKER_02]: And those are cool.

2664
02:56:34,725 --> 02:56:34,985
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.

2665
02:56:35,145 --> 02:56:36,506
[SPEAKER_02]: Because you get the best of both worlds.

2666
02:56:36,526 --> 02:56:37,346
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

2667
02:56:38,027 --> 02:56:43,509
[SPEAKER_02]: But, um, but as far as now women's underwear thing, thongs suck!

2668
02:56:45,729 --> 02:56:51,050
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, so I'm going to flip around the question and ask DD Archaholic, granny panties or thongs?

2669
02:56:53,391 --> 02:56:55,671
[SPEAKER_02]: There is a wide variety of women's underwear.

2670
02:56:55,711 --> 02:56:56,411
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, I know, I know.

2671
02:56:56,431 --> 02:56:58,051
[SPEAKER_02]: See, for guys, it's usually either or.

2672
02:56:58,411 --> 02:57:02,532
[SPEAKER_02]: But for women, there are so many choices because, you know, we need more choices.

2673
02:57:02,852 --> 02:57:03,633
[SPEAKER_02]: We're complex.

2674
02:57:04,933 --> 02:57:05,953
[SPEAKER_15]: All right, let's go on to the next question.

2675
02:57:05,973 --> 02:57:09,034
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, buying underwear has to be a monumental decision.

2676
02:57:13,328 --> 02:57:13,889
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright, moving on.

2677
02:57:14,310 --> 02:57:17,978
[SPEAKER_15]: EOSFVB, do all women have bust sizes that are even numbers?

2678
02:57:18,058 --> 02:57:21,225
[SPEAKER_15]: Because I recall somebody mentioning that bras only come in even numbers.

2679
02:57:23,345 --> 02:57:25,646
[SPEAKER_15]: This is funny, because think back to the last question.

2680
02:57:26,566 --> 02:57:32,648
[SPEAKER_15]: Like, briefs only come in even numbers, too, and boxers and pants only come in even numbers as well.

2681
02:57:32,708 --> 02:57:34,248
[SPEAKER_02]: So the waist sizes are usually... Underwear.

2682
02:57:34,508 --> 02:57:39,050
[SPEAKER_02]: Underwear comes in single numbers, 6, 7, 8, etc.

2683
02:57:39,890 --> 02:57:41,591
[SPEAKER_02]: Boss sizes, though, are only in even numbers.

2684
02:57:42,271 --> 02:57:44,191
[SPEAKER_17]: Pant sizes are not only in even numbers.

2685
02:57:44,512 --> 02:57:46,492
[SPEAKER_02]: If they are juniors, they are in odd numbers.

2686
02:57:46,812 --> 02:57:48,813
[SPEAKER_02]: If they are misses, they come in even numbers.

2687
02:57:49,353 --> 02:57:54,817
[SPEAKER_17]: And boxers and briefs and stuff, they're normally like 36 to 38 or something like that.

2688
02:57:55,117 --> 02:57:56,278
[SPEAKER_02]: Because they're elastic, right?

2689
02:57:57,239 --> 02:58:00,761
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, but what about bras, bras specifically?

2690
02:58:01,502 --> 02:58:02,122
[SPEAKER_02]: I hate underwear.

2691
02:58:02,202 --> 02:58:02,963
[SPEAKER_15]: They're all even, right?

2692
02:58:04,704 --> 02:58:08,186
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, I want to know.

2693
02:58:08,867 --> 02:58:10,087
[SPEAKER_17]: Of course, you've got two.

2694
02:58:10,148 --> 02:58:10,488
[SPEAKER_17]: Hello?

2695
02:58:12,179 --> 02:58:14,340
[SPEAKER_17]: I want to know why they have double D and not E

2696
02:58:32,003 --> 02:58:35,287
[SPEAKER_02]: But they do sell bra sizes up to G because I was watching Geraldo.

2697
02:58:36,308 --> 02:58:40,413
[SPEAKER_02]: And these women were like... Geraldo's been cancelled for like... This was a while back.

2698
02:58:40,454 --> 02:58:41,074
[SPEAKER_02]: This was a while back.

2699
02:58:41,375 --> 02:58:44,098
[SPEAKER_02]: These women were on this show with these just humongous knockers.

2700
02:58:44,799 --> 02:58:49,044
[SPEAKER_02]: And they had them... No, I mean they were like the size of watermelons.

2701
02:58:50,226 --> 02:58:50,406
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

2702
02:58:52,253 --> 02:58:55,397
[SPEAKER_02]: And they... You all need to see this.

2703
02:58:56,018 --> 02:59:00,143
[SPEAKER_02]: But no, they were novelty models and they were all, you know, normally sized bodies.

2704
02:59:00,624 --> 02:59:01,945
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of them were actually too small.

2705
02:59:02,466 --> 02:59:07,052
[SPEAKER_02]: But they had their breasts enlarged to this humongous size.

2706
02:59:08,253 --> 02:59:09,415
[SPEAKER_02]: They look like a bad doujinshi.

2707
02:59:10,265 --> 02:59:13,106
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, I don't understand with women getting that kind of thing.

2708
02:59:13,146 --> 02:59:14,366
[SPEAKER_17]: You know what I don't understand?

2709
02:59:14,526 --> 02:59:18,107
[SPEAKER_17]: And I keep seeing these on stupid porno pop-up ads.

2710
02:59:18,167 --> 02:59:22,929
[SPEAKER_17]: What is up with the freaking, you know, monster cock thing, okay?

2711
02:59:23,469 --> 02:59:28,290
[SPEAKER_17]: Why do they Photoshop, like, you know, zoomed-in versions of cocks on these normal people?

2712
02:59:28,310 --> 02:59:29,170
[SPEAKER_17]: Because it looks stupid.

2713
02:59:29,210 --> 02:59:30,731
[SPEAKER_17]: They have the same thing with, like, uh...

2714
02:59:31,791 --> 02:59:44,593
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, like, also with women getting these breast sizes that are like larger than D or double D and shit, like V or, I don't even know how high it goes, but it's like, you get more breast mass than you do actual, you know, woman.

2715
02:59:45,173 --> 02:59:55,175
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, it's almost, I don't know, like, I was sort of watching some of those talk shows for a while, and it's like, I think after a while they just start making up letters and numbers, so I'd like a QQRJ3.

2716
02:59:56,995 --> 02:59:57,275
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright.

2717
02:59:57,696 --> 02:59:59,916
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know, there's one other thing, though, about that,

2718
03:00:01,219 --> 03:00:04,900
[SPEAKER_02]: Down the line, those women are going to have some serious back problems.

2719
03:00:05,160 --> 03:00:07,901
[SPEAKER_02]: Serious back problems.

2720
03:00:07,941 --> 03:00:09,821
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to be tripping over their own boobs when they're 80.

2721
03:00:10,162 --> 03:00:13,442
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, I've got to get things moving here because we're almost to the end of the show.

2722
03:00:13,522 --> 03:00:14,403
[SPEAKER_15]: Three more questions.

2723
03:00:14,483 --> 03:00:14,823
[SPEAKER_15]: No more.

2724
03:00:14,983 --> 03:00:16,083
[SPEAKER_15]: Don't send us any more questions.

2725
03:00:16,143 --> 03:00:17,324
[SPEAKER_15]: We've got the last three right here.

2726
03:00:17,424 --> 03:00:17,804
[SPEAKER_15]: Here we go.

2727
03:00:17,904 --> 03:00:21,365
[SPEAKER_15]: Stresso wants to know, Hey Jamie, how about ice cream on dick?

2728
03:00:21,485 --> 03:00:21,885
[SPEAKER_02]: Too sticky.

2729
03:00:22,805 --> 03:00:22,905
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

2730
03:00:22,925 --> 03:00:22,965
[SPEAKER_15]: No.

2731
03:00:22,985 --> 03:00:23,265
[SPEAKER_15]: It's just you.

2732
03:00:23,285 --> 03:00:23,605
[SPEAKER_15]: No, Naoki's both.

2733
03:00:23,625 --> 03:00:24,125
[SPEAKER_15]: And everything.

2734
03:00:24,145 --> 03:00:24,546
[SPEAKER_15]: And nothing.

2735
03:00:41,098 --> 03:00:41,758
[SPEAKER_15]: I guess this is a good one.

2736
03:00:41,778 --> 03:00:43,839
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll let one more in because this is a good one to end things on.

2737
03:00:43,919 --> 03:00:46,259
[SPEAKER_15]: MoreThanJake543 wants to know why.

2738
03:00:46,279 --> 03:00:47,300
[SPEAKER_18]: I guess I said so.

2739
03:00:48,460 --> 03:00:48,900
[SPEAKER_15]: Beautiful.

2740
03:00:48,960 --> 03:00:50,541
[SPEAKER_17]: Hello, ice cream on a penis.

2741
03:00:50,641 --> 03:00:52,041
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, it's cold.

2742
03:00:52,481 --> 03:00:56,502
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, it doesn't like the... How about a hot fudge sundae?

2743
03:00:56,522 --> 03:00:58,363
[SPEAKER_17]: That's fucking hot.

2744
03:00:58,543 --> 03:00:58,943
[SPEAKER_17]: Hello.

2745
03:00:59,783 --> 03:01:01,344
[SPEAKER_17]: That's like pouring coffee on your dick.

2746
03:01:02,244 --> 03:01:07,245
[SPEAKER_02]: The whole purpose of foreplay, the whole purpose of foreplay, correct me if I'm wrong, is to get the dick hard.

2747
03:01:08,146 --> 03:01:09,106
[SPEAKER_02]: So it can do the job.

2748
03:01:10,329 --> 03:01:11,610
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't cold make it shrink?

2749
03:01:11,650 --> 03:01:14,351
[SPEAKER_17]: Hello, I want to know, why would you need an excuse sandwich?

2750
03:01:14,551 --> 03:01:22,553
[SPEAKER_15]: Sweetie, that works both ways, though, because, you know, to get the cock and the mmm, haha, you need to get the haha little, you need to get things going down there, you know what I mean?

2751
03:01:23,034 --> 03:01:25,274
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, yes, I mean, but I mean... You need to turn on the sprinklers.

2752
03:01:26,035 --> 03:01:27,495
[SPEAKER_02]: But I mean in terms of dick.

2753
03:01:28,896 --> 03:01:32,717
[SPEAKER_02]: The purpose is, and for a guy, the purpose is to get the dick hard, right?

2754
03:01:34,469 --> 03:01:35,670
[SPEAKER_02]: Isn't ice cream to feed that?

2755
03:01:36,171 --> 03:01:37,132
[SPEAKER_17]: It seriously would.

2756
03:01:37,552 --> 03:01:39,094
[SPEAKER_02]: Unless you're going for rigor mortis.

2757
03:01:39,254 --> 03:01:46,181
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know if things have changed since the last time I've had sex, because it's been a while, so they might have changed things, but last time, I do remember those were the rules.

2758
03:01:46,815 --> 03:01:54,778
[SPEAKER_17]: Last time I checked, I didn't bring in, like, a whole bunch of, like, condiments and fucking dessert items into the bedroom and shit.

2759
03:01:55,078 --> 03:01:59,259
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, first of all, okay, let's just say, say you're getting up to that point where you're going to put ice cream on the penis.

2760
03:01:59,339 --> 03:02:03,541
[SPEAKER_17]: You have the ice cream sitting there on the side of the bed or whatever, melting away, like, dribbling all over.

2761
03:02:03,561 --> 03:02:05,161
[SPEAKER_17]: You know how much of a mess it's going to make?

2762
03:02:05,201 --> 03:02:05,862
[SPEAKER_17]: Holy shit.

2763
03:02:07,082 --> 03:02:07,822
[SPEAKER_17]: I know, seriously.

2764
03:02:08,182 --> 03:02:09,403
[SPEAKER_16]: What if it's a flavor you don't like?

2765
03:02:09,523 --> 03:02:11,724
[SPEAKER_16]: I know, it's like your favorite flavor, and it's just melted on the floor.

2766
03:02:11,924 --> 03:02:12,724
[SPEAKER_16]: It's kind of pointless.

2767
03:02:13,163 --> 03:02:15,004
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright, it's time to wrap up the show.

2768
03:02:15,044 --> 03:02:22,030
[SPEAKER_15]: We're going way over, and the fortune cookie message is three and a half minutes tonight, too, which doesn't help, so we're going for a record here, but that's okay.

2769
03:02:24,151 --> 03:02:24,631
[SPEAKER_15]: Final thoughts?

2770
03:02:25,692 --> 03:02:25,952
[SPEAKER_15]: Jamie?

2771
03:02:26,313 --> 03:02:27,273
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't put ice cream on dick.

2772
03:02:28,134 --> 03:02:28,474
[SPEAKER_15]: Zero.

2773
03:02:29,115 --> 03:02:30,015
[SPEAKER_16]: What kind of propel do you like?

2774
03:02:30,075 --> 03:02:30,756
[SPEAKER_16]: I almost bought you some.

2775
03:02:31,556 --> 03:02:31,677
[SPEAKER_16]: Peach.

2776
03:02:31,697 --> 03:02:31,857
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

2777
03:02:32,357 --> 03:02:32,597
[SPEAKER_15]: Peach.

2778
03:02:33,398 --> 03:02:33,678
[SPEAKER_15]: Loki?

2779
03:02:35,359 --> 03:02:38,622
[SPEAKER_17]: The audience is way too young to be hearing this stuff.

2780
03:02:39,482 --> 03:02:40,463
[SPEAKER_17]: That's all I gotta say.

2781
03:02:40,976 --> 03:02:44,217
[SPEAKER_15]: and my final thought is the audience is horny.

2782
03:02:45,278 --> 03:02:45,578
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

2783
03:02:45,638 --> 03:02:45,958

[SPEAKER_15]: I will not be here.

2791
03:03:00,070 --> 03:03:02,972
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, my God, we didn't even announce these other things that we're going to do.

[SPEAKER_15]: That starts February 12th here on the station.

2800
03:03:20,567 --> 03:03:24,730
[SPEAKER_15]: Also, we're kind of cramming this all in at the last minute.

2801
03:03:25,051 --> 03:03:30,094
[SPEAKER_15]: Don't forget, required logins to Live365.com starts on February 13th.

2802
03:03:30,455 --> 03:03:34,298
[SPEAKER_15]: If you access the station directly through Winamp, you're not going to be able to do that anymore.

2803
03:03:34,338 --> 03:03:35,779
[SPEAKER_15]: This was not our decision.

2804
03:03:36,219 --> 03:03:39,361
[SPEAKER_15]: This is something that Live365 is doing to all of their stations.

2805
03:03:39,702 --> 03:03:46,047
[SPEAKER_15]: If you're afraid of signing up for a registration because you're going to get spam, I suggest you sign up for a Hotmail account, just a dummy account, and send it.

2806
03:03:46,207 --> 03:03:46,487
[SPEAKER_15]: I know.

2807
03:03:46,847 --> 03:03:53,091
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't endorse spam at all, but Live365 swears up and down they will not sell your email address to spammers.

2808
03:03:54,352 --> 03:03:56,514
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, and Zero says he hasn't gotten anything.

2809
03:03:56,674 --> 03:03:58,255
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't get anything, so I do believe it.

2810
03:03:58,615 --> 03:04:03,478
[SPEAKER_15]: They're just wanting your age and that stuff so they can track, hey, 18-year-olds like to listen to Orange Lounge Radio or whatever.

2811
03:04:03,738 --> 03:04:07,381
[SPEAKER_15]: Gosh, we have a lot of 12-year-olds listening to this station that talks about pornography.

2812
03:04:07,621 --> 03:04:09,963
[SPEAKER_17]: They won't sell your, you know, name.

2813
03:04:10,363 --> 03:04:16,607
[SPEAKER_17]: But here's what they'll do is they'll go ahead and give them to the companies and then have the companies leave the money in the normal drop spot.

2814
03:04:17,107 --> 03:04:19,570
[SPEAKER_15]: And Tuesday we have a possibility of a fuck-off show for me.

2815
03:04:33,086 --> 03:04:34,627
[SPEAKER_15]: Cool, Tuesday Possibility of a Fuck Off show.

2817
03:04:38,069 --> 03:04:42,811
[SPEAKER_15]: We're going to do a whole special for the CyberBeat Nation trip that I'm going on this next week while I'm not going to be on the show.

2818
03:04:42,831 --> 03:04:50,355
[SPEAKER_15]: We're going to do a whole special, a couple hours, maybe an hour or two, I don't know yet, of just interviews, journal things, and who knows what.

2819
03:04:50,575 --> 03:04:51,055
[SPEAKER_15]: It'll be fun.

2820
03:04:51,476 --> 03:04:52,676
[SPEAKER_15]: So we'll be airing that soon.

2821
03:04:53,197 --> 03:04:56,999
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, that was all the Orange Lounge news crammed into about two minutes.

2830

[SPEAKER_03]: Other things just make you swear and curse.

2831
03:05:38,851 --> 03:05:43,835
[SPEAKER_03]: When you're chewing on life's gristle, that grumble, give a whistle.

[SPEAKER_03]: Always look on the bright side of life For life is quite absurd and death's the final word You must always face the curtain with a veil Forget about your seat, give the audience a grin Enjoy it, it's your last chance anyhow So always look on the bright side of death
