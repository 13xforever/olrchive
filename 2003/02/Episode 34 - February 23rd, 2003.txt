What's your favorite scary movie?
Showgirls.
Absolutely frightful.
What's yours?
There are no stupid questions, just stupid people.
Don't torture yourself.
That's my job.
Now's the time when Sprockets made me dogs!
I'll get you, my pretty.
And your little dog, too.
I know Kung Fu.
I'm sorry, but all questions must be submitted in writing.
Why did they have to take the word gay?
Nobody expects us to punish a physician.
It's Kendo.
DarkSakura, Shut up!
Where's my gun?
This is my boomstick!
Sky, Come on girls, it's time to drop the bomb!
Loki, I can't for the life of me get the hooker to have sex with me.
What kind of warping being would find that funny?

He's going to end up being like Loki.
He's just going to show up for every week until we decide to add him on.
No, no, it's cool, it's cool.
We're just fucking with you.
I thought she was waving hello.
Was that a hello or goodbye?
I hate English.
You know what?
They're thinking that that might be a dead mic.
Hold on.
We're having some technical difficulties.
Let's try this again real fast.
Here, use my mic.
Not funny.
Bored.
Goddammit.
Show's falling apart already.
Alright, go around and introduce yourself one more time with a mic that works, and I'll figure out what's going on with the other one.
Nom nom nom nom.
DarkSakura
Come on girls, it's time to drop the bomb!
I can't for the life of me get the hooker to have sex with me.
Orange Lounge Radio

My name is Rob Roberts, and you might know me as Sky.
Joining me as always are my awesome co-hosts, and this quarter, the happiest bunny on the Happy Tree Farm is Jamie Summers.

I'm rolling games.
What am I?
Also with us tonight, say hello to Zero.
Hey, how's it going?
He's our host in training.
What exactly would you call Zero the sequel?
One?
Or is it zero squared is still zero?
He's a prequel.
Zero one.
Oh, I made up a mommy joke!
Ow.
He can be our host in training.
Or intern.
Does that mean he has to wear diapers?
Hey, you know, Walgreens had some depends on sale half price.
You can just put like heels on my feet.
Then you have a training bra.
Then you have Heelys.
But that's not funny.
How about a training bra?
He'd have to wear it on his head and go around to the screen.
I have a picture of Mel B with panties on his head.
I smell that picture.
I'm sorry, but you just made me think it's an understation joke.
Oh, what's that?
If you wore the bra on his head, he'd be Queen Amidala.
I'm Queen Amidala.
Hi, Travis.
Hi, Travis, if you're listening.
UnderStationLive.org, back up and running, by the way.
They moved, so they have this whole room now, their own studio, so check them out if you haven't yet.
You've got to know your roots.
Jamie and I's roots is UnderStationLive.org.
I burped.
I burped better than that earlier.
That was awesome.
You burped, like, bigger than my dad.
I burped artichoke hearts and vanilla coke.
That was the win.
Anyway, yes.
And mushrooms.
They were sauteed.
We'll be talking to everybody a bit more later.
We'll be talking about Cyber Beat tonight, the big tourney that happened in SoCal for a little bit.
We got some clips from the interviews and stuff.
That'll be fun.
That doesn't feel to be paid out of vinegar.
Yes?
You feel not so fresh.
I have that not so fresh feeling once in a while.
Twit.
Alright, we'll be right back.
Here's some another's for your listening pleasure on Orange Launch Radio.
Thank you for watching!
S, Actdeft, S, Actdeft
Thank you for watching
Thank you for watching!
Thanks for watching!
Chilli Pimps on Netflix
Hi, this is Mel B of RTF.
And for an extra $1.99 a minute, my girlfriend Mel B can join us on all the fun together.
Hey, if you're a broke ass like I am, why don't you come to the one place that costs absolutely nothing to go to and still the fun is just as great.
It's Orange Lounge Radio, Sunday nights.
Kick it with me and you just might realize the best things in life are free.
Yes, indeedly, the best things in life are free.
You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio, which is free.
Um, yeah.
I wouldn't exactly call it excellent.
I mean, I get like 250 messages a day.
Well, dang.
See, I know some people that get so much Yahoo spam, but I hardly get any on my account.
It's all sent to my trash.
But see, the thing is it doesn't empty fast enough.
I have to go in there and empty my trash like six times a day.
Because after like one day, I'll see that there's 75 messages in trash.
There's a bulk folder.
Yeah, 75 messages in trash, 26 in bulk, and like two in my other one.
And two that are actually in my inbox.
Both are spam.
You know, you can block the addresses.
I already have 100 blocked addresses.
Jeez.
I know.
Spammers are so high-tech nowadays that they change their address.
I mean, they're emailing you from a new address each time.
So even if you block it, they just go to, you know, say you're getting spammed from Loki 1.
Then they'll just go to Loki 2 and Loki 3.
Well, what I'm starting to do now is block.
You can block domains on there also.
Block AOL.
Just kidding.
One thing though that people should realize...
If you want a lot of that information we're getting into and don't want telemarketer calls, whenever a telemarketer calls you, tell them to opt you out.
It is a federal privacy law.
I work for a mortgage company now.
I used to work in customer service for one.
Tell them to opt you out.
If you have a mortgage, if you live with people who have a mortgage, tell them to have...
They're a servicer.
Opt you out of all outside communication not to share your information.
Call the three credit bureau reporting... I'm trying to remember what they are off the top of my head.
There's Equifax.
There's one of... not Equifax.
Yeah, Equifax.
There's two others, but I don't remember off the top of my head.
But you can also write your credit bureaus and have them not share your information because that's the primary way they get it.
I was going to say, a lot of people also know it as the don't call list.
If you tell a telemarketer to put you on the don't call list, then they have to.
Otherwise, that's breaking the law.
Yep.
But that right there.
Since we used to get about two, three telemarketer calls a night sometimes, I called one of them.
I said, opt us out.
We didn't get a single one for the next month.
And for junk mail, if you want it, this is great.
Maddox, from his wonderful site, recommended this.
When you get those credit card applications in the mail, take your junk mail, stick them in the nice little prepaid envelope given to you by the credit card mailer, and look, you got rid of your junk mail and the stupid credit card company stopped mailing you because you're sending them back junk mail.
You can also just write...
Three lovely words on top of every last bit of that junk mail.
Return to sender.
It works.
Or deceased.
Deceased is great.
When you write deceased, you don't get it mailed anymore.
I've done that with a couple of them.
It works.
That's messed up, but funny.
Wasn't that an old 80s song?
Return to sender, I guess.
I don't know.
Anyway.
There's a big bandaid on it.
If you're not being able to get in through your normal means, go ahead and go to our Java page at orangelounge.skie.cx Click on chat and use the Java applet because the server that the Java applet points to works fine.
So you can use that.
Cool, huh?
Jamie brought treats.
What kind of treats did you bring tonight, Jamie?
Shrimp chips.
Because every snack I get has to have some kind of connotation.
So I got shrimp chips this time.
and Sweet Potato Chips.
I don't like shrimp chips.
I mean, they're okay, but they just, they're so weird to me.
Like, when I eat shrimp, I expect to be eating, like, Long John Silver's Ghetto Deep Fried Shrimp.
Mmm, shrimpy.
They don't really taste like shrimp.
They smell like ass.
Or, actually.
They smell like rank pussy.
That's what it smells like.
They're yummy.
Damn it, I like pussy.
I mean, wait.
So how was the drunk show last week?
I wasn't here to experience it, unfortunately, but this is something EOSFBB gave me a link to.
I'll get to it in a minute.
Well, how did things go last week?
I was drunk.
I haven't listened to it.
How drunk did you guys get?
Not very.
Not me, anyway.
Melody was really silly.
I just got, like, drunk.
Okay, this is what I had.
I had...
About four things of... Actually, I drank out of this flask of... What was that Dutch chocolate liqueur that Melody brought?
Kahlua?
No, it's Dutch chocolate.
Really good chocolate liqueur.
I had a few swallows of that out of the flask.
You were drinking straight out of the bottle.
I made this drink with vanilla soy milk and Godiva liqueur.
No, this one brand of soy milk.
I'm making a face.
This one brand of soy milk, you can't even tell it's soy milk.
It's very creamy like real milk.
Mmm, creamy.
Oh yeah.
I do, I do, I do.
Um, yeah, whatever.
Um, but it was, I had like four of those or something.
And then, um, I had, um, a shot of vodka.
No, it wasn't vodka.
I had a shot of rum.
I had, um, three of those, um,
The Smirnoff Ice Triple Blacks Oh, those are so good.
Did anyone get super crazy or naked or super... No.
Everybody went... Ross brought a 40 of St.
Ives.
No, but the show went south when I brought my video over.
Yeah, everyone went downstairs to watch this video right here.
The Ron Jeremy porn star video.
Which I bought so we could watch it after the show.
Yay!
Yeah, I want to see it.
I heard about it.
Ron Jeremy can kiss his own penis.
How exciting.
I always have wanted to see a man kiss his own penis.
Not really.
Not you.
I just did this little jerk motion that made me look like I was about to do it and Jamie got scared.
What are these, sweet potato chips?
Uh-huh, they're yummy.
Let's read the back.
Sweet potato chips is made with sweet potato and made at Golden Crunch, containing no preservatives and no cholesterol.
It's an ideal snack for all ages.
Eat some!
Eat it!
Eat it!
Well?
Yeah, they're okay.
They're no Pringles, but they're good.
This is better.
They may not have sweet potatoes, and they're yummy.
What happened with Match Game?
People in the chatroom were talking about Match Game.
We kept talking about Ron Jeremy.
Jesus.
I didn't save it, unfortunately.
Oh, speaking of kissing penis...
EOSFEB wanted me to share this article with you all Mr. Spanky, Mr. Spanky Oh, you want Mr. Spanky to do it?
Alright, we'll get Mr. Spanky in here Hold on, we gotta call Mr. Spanky Jamie, call Mr. Spanky Mr. Spanky Then why don't you call Mr. Spanky?
What the fuck?
No
Paging Mr. Spanky.
Mr. Spanky, you have a call at the front desk.
We have a winner!
Mr. Spanky would now like to read you this article.
It's called, Teens Asked to Consider Oral Sex.
In London, school children under 16 are being encouraged to experiment with oral sex as part of a government-backed drive to cut Britain's sky-high teenage pregnancy rate.
The Times said the scheme, pioneered by a university and backed by the Department of Health and Education, trains teachers to discuss pre-sex stopping points.
The idea is to reduce promiscuity by encouraging pupils to discover levels of intimacy, including oral sex, instead of full sexual intercourse.
But family campaigners condemn the accord, saying it would only encourage children to experiment with sex.
The director of the Family Education Trust told the newspaper, I don't think that anyone believes that teaching people about oral sex will stop them from having full sex.
It's more likely to make them want to try it.
It doesn't protect them against sexually transmitted diseases.
Tell us about that, Mr. Spanky.
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
Blah, blah, blah.
Oh, Britain has the highest teenage pregnancy rate in Western Europe.
The government has a set target of halving levels by 2010.
Bye!
Tell us about the diseases.
No.
I put a spell on you!
I wanted to read some of the Yahoo Talkbacks here.
There's nothing better on Yahoo News than Yahoo Talkbacks.
You gonna go get some juice?
Let's see.
Oh, we have God is the answer.
I think that it's terrible.
They should teach them about God.
They should focus.
The should focus.
This guy's got a great education here.
The should focus in what the Bible says.
Want to give a good advice.
Get it from the Bible.
That sounds like English.
I'm sorry, what did you say?
He was educated in Britain.
God is the answer.
Let's see.
Let's look at re-God is the answer.
We could have been saying dog is the answer, but we wouldn't know.
Let's see, God is the answer.
None of these replies are any good.
I also think it's terrible that they should teach them about God.
Religion and school doesn't mix.
But sex ed is a real issue, not some religious one.
Let's see what else is there.
Oh, this is good.
This person says, teach hygiene first.
Washing of antiseptic solution like betadine or chlorhexidine to keep it clean and fresh at all times.
or, you know, oh, never mind, Jamie's not in the room right now.
Oh, here's one, GreatStuff98 says, why not anal?
I thought they were also pushing that for a bit.
Really weird, kids need to be kids and forget about the sex thing.
Let's see, one more, one more, let's see.
Let's see, they should teach good hand jobs.
Lucky be the man who's skilled at hand.
Alright, alright, alright.
Thank you for bringing this show down to a whole new level, ESVB.
I'm sorry I had to burp there.
It's weird being gone for like a week and having to come back.
It's like I feel like I haven't done this for like a whole month.
Yeah.
Anything else of interest happen last week, Loki?
No.
Okay.
No.
I don't know.
I want more metal pads off the eBay.
Okay.
Oh, you know what?
I'm going to be giving away... I'm going to get these.
My friend Matt is going to give them to me for free.
My other friend Matt is going to give them to me for free.
And I think we might do some kind of giveaway.
It's going to have to be a more local giveaway.
They're wannabe ignition pads.
They're not ignition pads, but they're the knockoff wannabe kind.
And I don't really have a use for them, so I think we're going to do some kind of giveaway.
I just don't know how yet, because I can't afford to ship them to anybody.
So they're going to have to be some kind of local giveaway.
I don't know.
We should, like, just hook them up and see how badly we can thrash them.
Oh, you just want to beat them up on air?
We could dissect a wannabe ignition pad live on air.
That would be fun.
No, that's stupid.
I've done it before.
Well, we could set it on fire, except we have no place to set it on fire at.
Okay, here.
That smells good.
What is that?
It looks like blood.
It looks like blood.
Jamie brought blood back here.
That's, uh...
Cranberry Grape?
Anyway.
It's Cranberry Apple Martinellis.
You know Giant Matt, right?
Yeah.
Giant Matt's giving me two wannabe ignition pads.
They're not ignition pads, they're the wannabe ones.
Some third party ignition pads.
I don't know, I was thinking we could do some kind of giveaway.
Give it to me.
You just want me to give them to you?
Yeah.
Well, I wanted to do a giveaway.
I want to borrow it.
Why don't I give you one and then we can give the other one away?
Okay.
Okay.
But we can't afford for shipping, although some people are saying they'll pay for shipping.
Well, we'll think of some kind of contest.
Maybe we can do something.
How about the DWI contest?
Ah, okay.
Okay, so that's going to be part of the prize for the DWI contest.
I like what you think.
I like the way this woman thinks.
That's because I think.
All right.
I think, therefore I am.
We're all going to be at, I was thinking we could do some kind of giveaway at B3, some kind of random door prize or something, I don't know though how that's all going to work.
B3 details are still being formed, although that is happening in May, May something through 17th, I don't know what it is, sometime in May.
I have an announcement.
You have an announcement?
Woohoo!
Announcements, announcements, alright, give your announcement.
We have a date set on the date of March 29th and March 30th, a tournament more usually held in the Bay Area.
It's going to be held at Scandia in Sacramento.
March Madness!
Yay!
We'll have details up on that, and by next week we should be able to give people links to where the rules are and all that information.
But be prepared, this one is not going to be just perfect attack.
This one's also going to be freestyle, and freestyle will be rather...
Can you tell us more about that at this time?
Even if I could, I wouldn't.
Not yet.
I've heard the proposition that they're doing for Freestyle.
It is going to kick so much ass.
This is really funny because on the drive down to SoCal, we were talking about the exact same thing.
And I said, I want to see that happen in Sacramento.
And lo and behold, it's going to.
Awesome.
So once again, March Madness, March 29th and 30th.
Sacramento, Scandia.
Sacramento, Scandia.
Be here or die.
Or we'll kick your ass.
That's it.
Ding.
More details forthcoming.
Keep your eyes on... I don't know if we'll get to be affiliated to that.
I can't say, oh, Sacramento sucks.
Do you know what I do?
I was just told that on Friday.
You were told that by someone whose opinion doesn't count.
Oh, yes.
Anyway.
You're already getting offers in the chat room to help with the tournament.
Stay tuned to DDR Freak.
We'll have a thread on it.
Sackbimani will have a thread on it for sure.
I will go ahead and say this.
There will be a meeting at my house for people who are in the area or can make it to the area.
Just send me a private message on Sackbimani.com to DarkSakura and I'll take any offers of assistance I can.
Yes.
Hopefully I'll be participating in that too.
Well, I can't say it.
I can't say it until more details come out.
How about you say the voice?
The voice.
Okay.
When more details come out, we'll be a little... We won't be so dodgy.
But you heard it here first.
Yes, you did.
Or second or third, I don't know.
First!
Anyway, speaking of tournaments, let's get to the CyberBeat tape, shall we?
Let's hear some of the CyberBeat stuff.
Okay.
Oh God, we're just going to hear, what we're going to do is we're going to play some clips.
We're not going to play because there's literally probably about an hour and a half of tape from the Cyber Beat trip, from the LA trip.
However, a lot of it is very random.
I swear to God, Wendell went off for 20 minutes telling us a story about Mike Ngo, which is really funny.
But, you know, we just don't have the time to do that on this show right now.
But you'll have to tune in to hear that.
That's right, so if you want to hear that, you've got to tune in.
on Tuesday at 7 o'clock Pacific Time or Saturday at 4 o'clock Pacific Time.
Those are the two times we're going to be airing the Cyber Beat full tapes.
But in the meantime, we're going to play some clips for you because these are interviews that we did with some folks.
And the first set is going to be an excerpt from Saturday.
This is the day that PA wrapped up, so we're going to hear from the winner of Perfect Attack.
And we're going to hear some stuff starting off in the hotel room before we left.
We have another quick interview of somebody that came to visit us in our hotel room before we go.
So we're going to go to those tapes and we'll be right back.
Well, actually we'll be here because we might want to comment on how this is going.
So, here we go.
Wait, actually, wait, I don't think they're on yet.
Hold on, I gotta turn on the mixer.
I know what I'm doing.
You know what?
Alright, here we go, let's see.
I want to talk to you really fast so I have a chance.
Since we don't talk to new people on the show very often, I'll just put them on the spot.
I want to say hi to Tequila.
What's up?
What's up?
How are you doing?
Where are you from, Tequila?
I'm from Omaha, and how are you?
I'm pretty good.
So you came all the way out here from Omaha to do this tournament?
Yes, sir, I did.
What enticed you to get on that plane?
What was the factor that said, I've got to be at this tournament?
First prize.
Max 2 machine.
That's a lot of money.
So, you know, without giving too much away, what kind of secrets you got in your freestyle routine that's going to make you walk home with that machine?
Two props for my first routine.
Two sexy props.
Most scandalous routine ever.
Yes, Jamie?
One word.
Shades.
Big shades.
What have you, baby?
Definitely looking forward to seeing it.
Anything else you want to say to folks out there?
Anything about the tournament or what have you?
The videos will speak for themselves.
Let the videos speak for themselves.
More to come later.
I think we're going to have to interview you after that routine.
That's perfect.
All right, perfect.
Come find me because I'm a lazy bastard.
I don't tape much for the show.
I swear to God I will.
All right, great.
Videos won't truly get the whole feel of it.
I came to L.A.
just for this.
RTF domination, baby.
We shall see.
It was pretty hard, I guess.
Tiring?
Yeah, tiring.
I don't know.
The last match was kind of weird.
How many songs did you have to play in that last match?
I don't know, I was keeping count.
What was the toughest one?
What was the toughest one for you?
It must have been Paranoia, because I think that's the song I really messed up on.
Paranoia, Survivor.
Or, Survivor, Eternal.
So, did you train for this at all?
Like, did you practice a lot?
How do you do to prepare yourself for something like this?
You know, I went to MGL every day, you know, for like two weeks.
You know, something like that, yeah.
You're pretty well known in NorCal, at least, for being the PA guy that seems to walk away on the first prize for all the tournaments.
So, did you do anything extra for this, being like it was going to be a big tournament?
What do you mean, like, do anything?
Was there any, like, extra preparation?
Like, was it extra... Were you extra nervous for this one, or... Oh, yeah, I was...
Was it just another day for Jigger?
No, it wasn't another day.
I don't know.
I was getting kind of worried.
I saw really good PAs and stuff.
That whole training every day thing, that was like, whoa, it's crazy.
Any future tournaments you plan on attending?
I don't know of any coming up.
Except for one in Seattle.
I think my dad's taking me or something.
Now, I know your dad comes with you to all the tournaments.
That's pretty cool.
A lot of support.
Do you get a lot of support from your parents?
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's good.
They don't stand there and punish you if you do bad, do you?
No, no, no, no, no.
I'm just joking around.
Of course not, of course not.
But that's awesome that they show up and there's work.
Do you ever watch the tapes?
What tapes?
Because I know I see tapes sometimes.
I don't know.
Oh, yeah, yeah.
And it's cool because people actually ask me for copies and stuff sometimes.
Because nobody ever tapes PA.
It's like PA ain't important.
Nobody wants to tape that stuff.
But your dad does.
That's cool.
Yeah.
PA is not important?
Yeah.
What you mean by that, man?
No, I mean, but you know, like, if you get on the internet, there's all the freestyle videos, there's no PA videos.
Hey, I'm a PA-er myself, except I was too lazy for this one.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So anything else you want to say about the tournament?
Thoughts for the day?
I don't know, it was cool, because, like, the Markov people were, like, keeping me motivated.
Like, my girlfriend, and, like, um... Wendell, yeah, Wendell.
Wendell.
And, um, Mike, no...
and, yeah, just a number of people.
Good people in DDR.
Yeah.
Well, congratulations once again.
Good job.
What are you going to do with the controller?
Um, use it.
Where are you going to sell it?
Good answer.
You're not going to sell it?
Uh, I don't know.
Maybe.
I heard different stories about the controller, too.
Like, it's worth $400, and then I heard it was worth $800, then $400 again.
They're pretty hard to get a hold of now, so good luck.
BOO NER
Like I5?
I-5, alright?
The cops on I-5.
It's internet radio, you can say whatever you want.
Fuck the cops, alright?
Because, man, I swear to God, if they do that shit again, I just will bust their asses, man.
What happened?
You got pulled over?
Oh my God, dude, we're fucking driving, right?
Everyone else is going the same speed and shit.
And what does this fucking cop do?
You know you're going too fast?
What about your family?
Bitch, we're friends.
We know what the fuck we're doing.
So it's like, fuck you, cops.
Fuck you, Highway Patrol.
You hear that?
You give me one more motherfucking ticket, and I'm gonna go like Jahi on your asses, alright?
It's the nephew of the week, straight from Bob Lombardi, how about that?
So, I notice a lot of freestyles around here, they're kind of nervous, competition's a little tight, what are your thoughts going into freestyle?
You know what, when I first came down here, I didn't give a fuck about freestyle, you know, because I figured I would just go up there, you know, improv something like I usually do, you know?
But then I started talking, you know, like, I mean, people like Wendell, you know, like Hypnotix, or Go, excuse me, you know, people like Bruce Leroy, Mel B, you know, and it's like, you know, they're taking it hella seriously and stuff, and it's like...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Well, you can't put it on a job application, okay?
Man, I was number one, you know, at this Southern California tournament.
People were cleasing my toes.
They'd be like, so?
Maybe if you're auditioning for Broadway, like Chicago.
Yeah, there you go.
That is a good point.
That is a very good point.
However, you know, I'm, once again, I'm going to go up there.
I'm going to do my thing.
You know, if I make it to tomorrow, that's excellent.
If I don't, I still came down here to kick with my friends, you know, represent North Carolina to the fullest.
Awesome attitude to have.
Everybody should be like Bob Lombardi, ladies and gentlemen.
Everybody!
Arirarira!
Yay!
Any other thoughts you have for the folks at home listening?
If you see a police officer drive by after he passes you, flip his ass off.
Fuck the police!
Oh, can we get a little rap?
Alright.
So, Mel's back over here too.
What do you think about PA, Mel?
It was, well... He intends!
That's Wendell's catchphrase.
Hey, sure beats sticking around, but I digress.
PA, man, it's... I mean, I can't honestly say that I was surprised.
I mean, I pretty much... It was Tigger, and it was pretty much his tourney to lose.
But, you know, it's like, I mean, people did show up, and, like, the thing between JSP, though, it was, like, endless love.
I mean, it was like if frickin'...
If Stevie Wonder and, like, someone else blind had to play tennis, it was like endless love, man.
It was like back and forth, back and forth.
Nothing was happening, then this guy slammed the door like a closer, and props to him, man.
I mean, it's kind of funny that...
Mel, by the way, did a whole bag of crack for this interview.
No, I'm just kidding.
I'm trying to think of where this reference leads to.
I was following it that day.
There must have been something in the smog because I was totally following him that day and right now I'm listening to this going, I have no idea what you're talking about, Mel.
Well, that's okay.
He forgives me, I hope.
He went to turn and he don't play a damn game of 2DX, but I'm sure someone on eBay or someone else is gonna make his pockets a little fatter, so props to him.
Props to him.
So now you're gonna tell us any, like, surprises we can look forward to your routine, like digging your mouth?
Oh, damn.
Um, well...
I don't know about surprises.
I mean, it's just, there'll be new moves, that's for sure.
New moves I don't thought, I mean, people think they saw my Let's Talk It Over from Miggle 2, but this one's going to be a complete 180 remix.
It's going to look pretty tight.
I'm just thinking, yeah, it's going to be enough to be a pretty high qualifier.
Then tomorrow, like I said, it's Overdrive.
Did anyone whip out their cock?
The thing about CyberZone, the arcade where it was hosted, they have in the back karaoke booths where you can go and you sit in and sing karaoke songs for like 50 cents and it grades you on a scale of 0 to 100.
Irene and I probably sat in there like all day Saturday and played that game, so we missed.
Thanks for watching!
I saw the picture, by the way, the karaoke machine, and the text on that one.
They brought one of those out.
They had, like, the portable one.
They brought one of those out at our meeting for Thanksgiving, our Thanksgiving dinner, and it grades you, like, a percentage based on how accurate you are with the music.
I want one of those.
Buy me.
Okay.
Look on eBay.
Evil Bay Didn't you just buy something big on eBay recently?
Yeah, I bought two, well, they're Cypher Games, they're metal pads.
They normally would go for $200 a piece.
I bought two for $187.
Hmm, brand new.
I guess they were expecting it to go higher.
Also, personal message, I'm sure he's not listening, but to the person that goes by the name, aloha to you too, I beat your ass by $2.30.
So there.
The little fucker wanted to come and upbid me and thought, oh, I'm going to get the pads at the last minute.
Well, I came in 30 seconds to close and threw up the bid of about another $2.
You don't want to know about my eBay exploits.
What'd you do?
It's not every bid I do.
If something that I didn't know was going to go for about $15, $20, 10 seconds before it's over, I bid $50.
I ended up getting this doujinshi for $30.
It was worth it.
It was a nice 70 page.
Really nice.
I bid $150 on it.
Because I knew nobody would top it.
See, the thing is when people do stuff like that to me, I know how much it's worth.
I'll bid up to about how much it's worth.
So I'll knock up the bid another $100 on something that's not worth that much.
Right on.
Fuck the police!
Yes, do you feel not so fresh?
Do you need to be one with the questions?
Apparently, I constantly always have that not-so-fresh feeling, and I never knew why.
Now you do.
Now I do.
Now you know, and knowing is half the battle.
Thanks to my guardian angel.
I still think that's so funny.
It is funny.
All right, we'll be back.
and so on.
Thanks for watching!
Thanks for watching!
Orange Lounge Radio.
We put your thing down, flip it and reverse it.
I guess you heard that in Target the other day or something, Jamie?
Yes, and I hate that type of music.
I don't consider that music.
You know what's funny?
They were playing that at the club last night.
I went out to the club, get my dance on, and they played like this whole set of like booty, like new wave booty.
Not the old stuff like you like, but the new wave booty music.
Like Lil' Kim, that song, and then that song that goes, my lips, my back, my pussy, and my track.
No, when Johnny was over, he found that song and played it for us.
And we were like going, turn that off.
Melody made him turn it off.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Anyway, yeah, hi.
You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
We occasionally talk about Bomani on this show when there's nothing better to talk about.
Oh, yes, Zero.
I heard two little, like, 12-year-old girls singing that song on the bus today.
I'm not even joking.
They're standing there on the bus doing it.
I'm like, they know this by heart.
They must have listened to it like 100 times just before they got on the bus.
It was sad and scary all at the same time.
You know what it was when I was a kid?
Remember, you too can prevent skanks.
Skanks.
You know what, I think I might actually have this, but... You know, when I was young, it was all about this, like, this was the song that really pissed my parents off.
This song really pissed my parents off.
I don't know if you guys know this song.
I have to find the part of it.
Do you realize that people are still having sex?
They've been told not to.
Perhaps they are perplexed.
When you see them, they're making future plans to engage.
Speaking of bad remixes, I downloaded Slim Shady and the background music was Billie Jean.
I got a really bad one.
No, this is fucking horrible.
Listen to this.
I just downloaded this the other day.
This is the most fucking horrible thing I've ever heard in my life.
I'll bring it next week.
Okay.
We're going to have to have like a, some kind of, maybe like a pre-show or sometime on the station we have to play.
Worst remix ever.
Really, really bad remixes.
Nothing beats the Splat Attack William Shatner Techno Mixes.
Those are the most god-awful things you'll ever hear.
The music's bad and the samples are worse.
It's just awful.
Listen to this.
You might recognize this song from 2DX6 style.
Listen to how they rape this song.
They're two different fucking keys!
Okay?
That was torture because, okay, I have a perfect sense of pitch.
I'm a man.
I used to elbow people when their horns were out of tune.
Go, okay, you're out of tune.
And that, the dissonance in that was enough to make heads explode like in scanners.
Okay?
The very first thing the chatroom goes, is that a twin mix?
Chatroom, I love you.
Okay, I mean, like, who decided to mix Vincent Damore and Whitney Houston?
That's what I want to know.
Like, the worst thing I heard lately was that Max 300 jump.
I don't know who did it, but it's like, it's the 7 jump with Max 300.
They just laid them on top of each other and played them at the same time.
The worst one is this Mario, what was it, Mario Max, and, and, and, and, I, I keep, you know, people are like, people, I swear to God, there's people doing talkbacks, and like, they say, so why can't there, anyone make any good remixes of Max 300, like Mario Max, and, and then someone, Mar, what?
It's awful, awful shit, don't mix anything from 4th Mix with Max 300, it's just wrong.
No, it was just horrible anyway.
It's like, they'd cut, they'd stop Max, play some Mario, cut Mario, play some Max.
Ew.
No, first of all, Whitney Houston needs to have her larynx pulled out.
so that we never have to hear from her again.
And tell her to stop acting.
I hated that fucking movie.
My girlfriend made me watch it last night.
Freaking Bodyguard.
The whole movie was about her bitching.
Bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch
But no, and you know, Whitney Houston takes this credit for I Will Always Love You, that song.
She fucked up that song.
Fuck you, Whitney Houston.
That is all about Dolly Parton.
Shit, Dolly Parton cried during that.
Dolly Parton cries in the middle of it.
I agree.
There is no other version of that song.
Whitney Houston needs to die.
Bobby Brown.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
It's South Sacramento.
Two good versions of I Will Always Love You.
Dolly Parton version and the version the girl belts out in the window in Hedwig.
That's it.
Yes, that is the best.
The one done with the thick country accent.
That was one of the highlights of my LA trip, by the way, was getting to see Hedwig on stage.
We're taking you next time.
Irene and I want to go back.
Why isn't Irene here tonight?
She promised me she'd be here.
Irene, if you're listening, you suck.
Gum hella sucks.
Hey, we have shrimp chips and you're missing out.
Yeah, I have that CD that Brad wanted with all the Death Race songs on it.
Death Race?
Oh, Death Race.
Anyway.
Hi.
Okay, now that we've talked about horrible remixes, you want to get to the FUs of the Week?
Yeah.
Alright.
Since we might have some new people listening in tonight, because we have the cyberbeat stuff, some people wanting to tune in to hear that, tell the folks what the FUs of the Week are all about.
We pick stuff that we hate and bitch about it.
That's about it.
This is fucked up!
I love that thing.
Um, my threshold today goes toward, um... Well, okay, last night, it was, uh, me and Tina and her sister-in-law.
We're all coming back from, uh, the Rocky cast meeting.
And we were gonna, um, we went to an interview, we were gonna...
Now that was a surprise to me, reading that you went back there.
What?
Letterbees.
I went to the good letterbees, I didn't go to the ass letterbees.
Oh, okay, okay.
Who, by the way, fucked them for not sending me my free ice cream coupon yet.
I'm gonna call and, like, call their district manager and bitch them out.
Because I want my free ice cream, goddammit.
Anyway.
I know somebody who works there already.
But anyway, we'll go.
Yes, we got a good burp.
That burp is dedicated to the leather beans at Antelope.
And also, this one was brought to you not by Propel, it was brought to you by Martinelli's Cranberry Apple Sparking Cider.
Anyway, this guy in the truck, as we're leaving the guy to bond in on our great search for Jahi, this truck was like, not telling me, so you know what I did?
You know what I did?
I drove down to five miles an hour, and he couldn't pass me because there were cars coming.
So I went as slow as I could, and then I saw him about to duck over to turn, so I cut right in front of him and turned, right on to Madison.
And I went another five miles an hour.
He went to pass me, I cut him off.
He went to pass me, I cut him off.
And then I drove off into the sunset or a road, actually it was three in the morning or something like that.
into the darkness, into the dark black forest that's more appropriate for you, you drove off into the darkness from whence you came I was hoping that he would have drove past me so I could wave at him I love pissing off people when there's no traffic actually it's more like more than one ah, so you're the bitch he brought it on himself because he tailgated me, so fuck him yeah I'd also like to say um
You know what?
I'm really not that angsty about anything else.
There was this, like, scary person, though, that was at the virtual tour.
She was nice.
She was scary and wanted to talk to me.
It was definite Dawn Syndrome.
But I don't think anyone would get that unless they listened to 98 Rock right here.
You know what I'm talking about.
Disorderly and worthless nonsense.
It's basically when people come up to you and start idle conversations about nothing.
Like, say, for instance, you're standing in line.
I used to work there, like, I would do my internship in the morning when they were on air, and they would start doing that around the station, not even on their show, they would just start walking around doing it for no reason.
It was actually pretty funny.
But, yeah.
Well, we do that anyway.
Well, um...
I need to retract my FE to my CD player because now that I rigged it ghetto-style with paper, my faceplate stays on, although I can't turn down the volume or go back to listen to the track again.
Hooray, ghetto!
Another episode of the week goes toward the snack machine at my work.
Because in the morning, if I forget to eat my breakfast, the only thing that I have to eat is a NutriBrain bar out of the snack machine.
Our snack machine doesn't take dollars.
Or if it takes the dollar, it tells you to use correct change.
It also doesn't take nickels, dimes, or quarters.
So basically all that stuff.
And then it goes, ha, I can't get it.
It doesn't take a piece of pizza either.
Oh, gosh.
Not too angsty this week.
No!
I don't know, I've been just tired, so... No!
Tired not getting out because I'm trying to save money, so I'm not angsty.
Um, let's see here.
Oh, F you to the stupid bitch at, uh, release.
Listen, you stupid whore, um, I don't want your fucking sample.
I've said it to you before, and I said it to you again.
Stop trying to give me the damn sample.
Can she be a whore, really?
Who would pay for her?
I don't know if she's ugly, but anyways, yeah, she tried giving a sample to my friend, and it was like some taking rib on a stick, and she dropped the fucking thing down, down, slid down a little, you know, little cover there, it's like, and then like fell into like a basket full of chips or something like that.
and say, oh, let me give you another one!
He's like, no, that's fine.
But anyways, yeah, so F you to her because she's stupid.
And F you to pretty much everybody I talk to during the day at my work, except for my friend Andy, because you're all retarded and...
My god, I swear.
I think I may have mentioned this last week, but there was this... I had a big cup of hot chocolate.
Okay, I'm walking about six inches away from a rail that's up on the third floor balcony area where I work.
So what do the people try to do?
They try to cut between me and the six inch gap between the rail.
When there's a nice three feet or more, probably like six feet on the other side of me.
I mean, you... I think... I'm pretty convinced that everybody that works at VPD has no sense of, um... Well, let's see, no common sense.
They have no common sense whatsoever.
They're like, oh, I'm a split?
So, yeah.
F you to them.
F you to stupid drivers because you're still out there.
I hate you.
And F you to everybody that watches Oprah because, uh...
Because Oprah sucks and I loved it the other day.
Don't talk about my mother like that.
I loved it the other day after the Michael Jackson interview thing.
They're like doing a talkback.
Like acting like they're experts on the whole subject and everything.
And they absolutely had... I don't even think any of them watched the special.
and they're just talking back for a good two hours about the damn thing.
I just saw some... Oh, look!
Jack is still not talking about it.
Turned channel to, like, Vader's Gym or something like that.
Stupid fucking people.
Um...
F you to the people in the Congo.
I'm going to fucking cast an Ebola spell on your whole country.
So there.
What are you going to do now?
I'm in another country.
You can't touch me.
You're going to die.
From Ebola.
They'll cast rockets.
I weep for humanity, and these people that I weep, you know, cause me to weep.
That and the whole fact that they're shutting down the Folsom Dam because of the threat of terrorism.
Because, you know, people are going to come out of the middle of nowhere and just bomb the dam instead of, you know, bombing LA, San Francisco, you know, one of the major cities.
If Folsom Dam gets bombed, wouldn't it just flood the prison?
It would flood Sacramento with 12 feet of water.
Which I wouldn't listen to.
Do you realize how much Loki is like Nelson from the Simpsons?
Uh-huh!
Oh, and the best one.
I just laughed my ass off when I saw this.
That'd be the stupid doctors that botched that fucking transplant.
I mean, that was hilarious.
The thing was labeled correctly.
A... was it A?
I don't know.
The organs were A and the girl was O.
There doesn't go, there's a type of people trying to, you know, shove their round block through the square hole.
Were they, were they, they weren't Kaiser, were they?
It's so stupid.
They're like trying to save her.
I'm like, dude, she's so dead.
And I'm like, so surprised.
Oh my god, she died!
I can't believe it!
So shock, how could this happen?
And there's her parents, though, who think, oh, we want a second opinion to see if she's a little brain dead.
Uh, let's see here.
I mean, I feel bad for them.
that their daughter was lost due to incompetence.
I don't know, I'm no doctor or anything, but she's not moving and shit.
But, no brain, I don't see how you can simulate a lack of brain activity.
Oh, well, she's brain dead.
I don't know how you can get a second, you know, two tests that show zero brain activity.
I mean, unless blind hope, blind faith, you know, wanting to grasp at anything.
But, the first step towards healing and grieving...
is realizing that you actually have something to grieve.
We poked her with a stick, man.
Oh yeah, another thing.
F you to the stupid people in Rhode Island that got caught in that stupid fire.
I know you're all dead.
Isn't that a great white concert?
Hold on, hold on, hold on.
I'm not going to cover what you're talking about.
But what's hilarious is they're like, oh my god, this is so tragic.
Hello, they just used the one exit instead of the three fire exits that are built in this place.
Oh, they're trying to get out the one door.
Everyone's like, but there's exits over here marked fire exits in case of fire.
Like, that's happening right now.
Oops.
Yeah, I cry through humanity.
All right, I have something to say about it.
I have something to say about it.
I have something to say about this.
As long as we're... As long as we're... As long as we're joking about, you know, tragic events in the news, I have some things I'd like to say.
Okay, F you to the band Great White for setting that club on fire and killing a bunch of people, because I had to wait 45 minutes to get into the club last night, because they actually had to enforce the fire code, because you dolts burned down a club on the other side of the country.
And I don't know if you've seen the video of this, but like when the thing's set on fire, all these people are looking at the roof going, dude, I think there's something on fire.
I thought the club was on fire.
When I stand there high off my ass going, dude, there's an 80s hairband.
No, I would be high-tailing it out the fucking door.
I'd push and trample all you people.
God.
And you know what the saddest thing about this whole thing is?
Album sales are going to go through the roof for these guys.
Pun intended.
Great White is going to actually have a career again.
That's the real tragedy here, ladies and gentlemen.
Great White will bring the house down.
I choked on my shrimp chips.
Alright.
Anyway, moving on, my other FUs of the week are mudslides on I-5.
Because of mudslides on I-5, and I'm not talking about the drink, I'm talking about the actual mud sliding down the hill and covering the freeway.
Because of that, we heard that traffic was blocked for hours, so we had to go down 101 to get to LA.
That took like seven and a half hours.
I hated it.
Well, no, I didn't hate it because, you know, we were with good company, so it was all good.
Part of the countryside alongside the grapevine was on fire.
Cool.
We were stuck in traffic for three hours on the grapevine.
And then we went by and saw helicopters and fire, and I took pictures of it.
Was Great White playing there, too?
Actually, yes.
No.
All right.
Also, what else did my F use of the week?
Oh.
F. F. Stupid Children.
Remember JB and I eat children.
Children ramen.
We've come up with different flavors.
There's RVGL flavor that tastes like skank.
And you know, Scandia flavor which is pretty crunchy and tasty.
The CCL flavor tastes like ass.
I got a few.
One is to the jackass over in Scandia who thought it would be a good idea to try to punk everybody out of their tokens on the machine.
He was like, I went up to go play a game, and there were like three tokens sitting up there.
He came up and tried to steal my token, and then he tried to yell at me and start a fight with me on the extreme machine.
and then he went off and he like got mad because he didn't get to play which he was just out to take people's tokens he would start punching the carousel thinking like that's a good way to get rid of the stress and also little kids who think there's a crosswalk across the DDR panels
It's pretty simple.
This is a raging epidemic in every arcade, I'm sure.
Little kids who somehow see a crosswalk right there.
What is up with that?
Were you there when I grabbed the little kid and took her to his parents?
Yes, yes, I was.
That was fabulous.
Your child is going to end up with a broken foot if you don't watch your little kid.
Because we were playing VR back when it was the USA Mission.
Yep.
And this little kid proceeds to walk across the machine and I grabbed the kid and took him to his parents This dates all the way back to the first episode of the show If you won't take care of your kids, god damn it, I will That was a quote from the very first episode from Jamie When I was sitting there and they had the little kids running across there I looked at a friend of mine, I don't know who it was And I said, is there a crosswalk across the machine?
and his kid's mom heard me.
His kid's mom heard me.
She's all, excuse me, but I told him not to be doing that.
I said, I wasn't even talking to you.
I was just saying it, like, in general.
I was yelling at your child.
Shoot, there were so kids I wish I could be.
And also, a big FU to the drunk lady in Scandia on Friday.
She claimed she was from Brazil, Texas, New York, and, like, Europe somewhere.
And she kept telling everybody how sexy they were, and she was so bombed out and drunk.
It was pretty cool.
And also, the last one was good.
It was pretty cool.
It was pretty cool.
It was pretty cool.
It was pretty cool.
I went over there yesterday and I'm trying to pick out some soda to drink.
And this lady comes up trying to put soda in my cart, trying to tell me that this is what you should get and this is what you should drink.
And I was like, no.
And she's like, I ended up just leaving my cart and walking out of the store because she put like four 12-packs in my thing after I told her no.
And I was like, screw you, and I left.
Because she was a bitch.
And driver's divorce.
Yes, Jamie.
I have another one.
I think I just forgot what it was.
He was talking about the drunk woman at Scandia, Texas, Brazil.
Yes, I remember.
Outside Target, there's these guys who will say, Hi, I'm taking a communication class, blah, blah, blah.
This was part of, I think, Melody's Fuck You last week.
Because there was someone who was incredibly rude to her with this.
But, it feels gift-y to you, all these lines, and then they try to sell you magazines.
So finally, I looked over to the guy, he says, yeah, I'm doing a communication project, and by the way, you know, I just wanted to talk to all the pretty women in the park.
I'm like, okay.
First of all, I don't want to buy magazines.
Oh, you've already talked to somebody.
Know that my friend has them, quite honestly, no money belongs in my own goddamn pocket.
Not in yours.
And he's just like, don't you wanna buy one?
I'm like, no, I'm not nice, leave.
So he left.
Fuck him.
Another one, back to CCL.
Oops, sorry.
When they thought, like, they tell everyone that their pads are all in good condition, why did I feel like I had doubles heavy, like, in the middle of the song, and none of the right pad work?
and the stupid little rabbit girl who, like, would not stay off of the pad when I was trying to get up.
I, like, seriously, if I was a girl who would be a rabbit girl, I would be a rabbit girl.
I should have stepped on her clothing a little more.
She walked away.
Alright, let's move on to the chatroom FUs, shall we?
Play happy music.
Brace yourself, there's a ton.
Muhimer says, fuck word problems, fuck winter storms that lead to flooding of the massive sort, fuck my school for saying that school was cancelled Thursday because of snow and then deciding to change their minds a full day the night before, fuck my dad for still not getting cable so I can have wireless with my laptop and download Mutros DDR stuff, sad face, fuck my heater for breaking also, and fuck the new one for causing my allergies to annihilate me.
EvilNauki2DX says, fuck you to people who don't know how to follow forum rules.
Beautiful.
DarkTetsuya says, F you to being single.
Amen.
Winamp3 for crashing consistently on my MP3 CDs and one more I can't think of.
Oh, wait, I remembered.
Oh, F you to Sky for playing that shitty Vanessa May song.
Now I know such a thing exists.
I have a shitty Vanessa May song from Dance Mania 9.
It's some remix.
There's like no violin and like one verse of hers looped.
It's horrible.
It's awful.
It's putrid.
I'll play it for you after the show.
It's really sad.
But it's a remix, so it doesn't really count.
It's not really hard, then.
Yeah, exactly.
Hey, I got a nephew.
RiceRYC3 says, Fuck you, Gray Davis, for cutting the funds for my school.
I need my damn classes to transfer ASAP.
They're, like, upping it to $24 a unit instead of $11.
So, it's absolutely pointless.
Did you know, folks, that college is completely useless and was a waste of money?
All those people that get out of college end up coming to work at my work, and they get entry-level positions.
Whereas I haven't gone to college, or I tried going to college for a semester, and said, this is fucking boring and a waste of my money.
And I'm earning, maybe not as much as they are, but you know what?
They gotta pay back those college loans.
So, technically, I'm above them.
The one advantage of going to college at least for three years is that companies, when they hire you, they do have to hire you for a little bit more.
If you've had, like, two or more years of college.
I've had three!
I wonder if I got screwed at my company, because I've had three, even though I don't have a piece of paper to show it.
Daft Square says, fuck everybody who doesn't like oatmeal raisin cookies because they fucking rule.
I hate raisins.
Die.
What about just oatmeal cookies then?
That was Daft Square.
Oh, well don't die, but I hate raisins.
I like oatmeal chocolate chip cookies.
How about like... Oatmeal cream pies!
Okay.
Oatmeal Cookies are like, official costumes in here.
She gets her oatmeal cookie fixes in other ways, that's fine.
23rd Magus says, fuck you to the worm that's still going through these net servers.
It probably brought down LiveJournal the other day.
Actually, a denial of service attack brought down LiveJournal.
Fuck people to do that.
Jesus.
The denialist, you know what denialist service attack is?
That's when you get like all the computers that like paying a server like Yahoo or CNN or whatever to try and take it down, to overload it and take it down.
That's what happened to LiveJournal the other day.
But you know they credited all the paid users with four extra days because of it.
Really?
Okay, I didn't notice.
Yep, they did.
Mine's paid through June anyway.
Well, now it's paid through June 4th.
Okay, stupid fucking lamer hackers, I agree.
Fuck them, I say.
Fuck them in their ears, because their asses ain't good enough.
If they wanted their accounts to be cool, they should pay for it.
It's $25 for a year.
Fuck all of you, I'm sorry.
Well, I mean, but the LiveJournal went down for the paid users, too.
I mean, that sucks.
But yeah, but it's their fault.
Fuck Skrull, as usual, and fuck taking a zero period during lunch.
I can't eat lunch anymore, bitches.
Is that legal?
I actually had an issue with that back in seventh grade.
By law, they have to give you time to at least buy your lunch.
You can't have like five days of lunch.
You have to be able to eat lunch.
It is against the law.
That is so weird.
And I thought zero period meant... I thought zero... This is 23rd magazine.
Zero period was called zero period because it was before first period.
or, you know, well, I guess it depends.
I guess it depends.
Like, our schools didn't have a home.
We didn't have a home.
We had a home at my school, but it's now down.
And the thing is, it is against the law for them to deny you your lunch time.
So if you know what you need to do, you need to find whatever documentation you have on that.
Send it not only to the school board, send it to the PTA.
I guarantee you the soccer mobs are going to be on there.
That's right, stick the soccer moms on him.
Excellent suggestion.
That's your job.
They look thick.
Ooh, I can pitch you something.
Mama Jamie's looking out for you.
Stick the soccer moms on him.
Alright, uh, and you thought 23rd Magus' Angst was over, no, fuck you to Burning Heat SSR, oh, he's old school there, for being so friggin' hard to beat, and own you to We Will Rock You, easiest kata ever, out.
We Will Rock You's not a kata.
It is not a kata.
It's like a six.
Unless, oh, maybe on doubles.
No, not even on doubles, dude.
No way.
That's like, oh.
Dude, dude.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Yeah, I thought it was only like seven or eight at the most.
Wait, wait, wait.
You got a heart, Jamie, in the chat room?
I don't know.
Just because.
Just explain to me why I have a heart.
DarkTetsu, you put we heart DS.
Oh, thank you.
I don't have a heart, though.
I have a lump of coal like Smurfette.
You do, it's just black.
I have a lump of coal like Smurfette.
And if you don't remember, when Smurfette showed up, she had black hair and had a heart of coal.
Okay, this is what 23 Magazine is elaborating.
Okay, 23 Magazine is answering some of your questions here.
Okay, he can't go before school, can't make it, for whatever reason, so he has to go during lunch, which means he cannot eat.
Either I give up lunch or I give up graduating.
I don't buy it.
Take it to the PTA.
I mean, not that I don't believe you, but take it to the PTA.
They, by law, have to find a way to make that work for you to have lunch.
No, what we actually ended up doing was the parents got together and they sent a letter to the district superintendent.
And he was the one who went and changed all that around.
And he actually made it so we didn't have to do it.
That we actually didn't have to take the class.
You need to send that to the authority.
Don't sit on this.
Make sure that something gets taken care of.
Be an activist.
Nothing ever changes until you make it change.
Right?
Yep, very true, very true.
All right.
Black Lab has some FUs.
Puppy.
Puppy, why aren't you here?
Fuck the cold.
It's been making my skin break out.
Fuck midterms.
I hate them.
They suck.
Fuck my suitemates for smoking weed every day this past two weeks and making the whole suit sweet stink.
Fuck this sore throat that just came up this morning.
Fuck my horrible sleep pattern right now.
I keep sleeping through classes.
One more.
Fuck Tapioca Express for not turning up the volume on their machine even after I spent two hours cleaning the pads for them.
Wow, that's dedication right there.
Shit.
Oh my god!
Hey, it's a novel!
You people are raping this privilege.
Alright, here we go.
SnubDisanoid says, Big old fat F you.
That's an understatement here, too.
First off, fuck you to the people at CCL who decided that just because someone stringed the machine for tons of credits, it was okay to hog the machine like a bunch of motherfuckers.
I had to wait 90 minutes for one fucking game of DDR, and it was versus with some pretentious and not very good little...
The blanket is blank.
Even I, that's too dirty for me to read.
Little come in his shit, asshole.
It made me play on the two-player pads, which suck major ass.
Secondly, fuck you to CCL for not fixing the two-player pads for so long.
I understand.
That it's hard to repair the pads when people string the machine so excessively.
But it's been about two months now and the down and right arrows don't work unless you weigh 400 pounds.
So fuck them for having such shitty pads.
Okay, hold on.
I've never met the DubZipNoid guy or whatever his name is.
Who is he?
Because I talked to someone last night for like, while we were waiting after everyone filled all the pre-credits.
I don't know, is he like an Asian dude?
I have no idea.
You guys should meet offline or something.
This is horrible radio.
Why doesn't anyone watch those cameras?
And they have, like... What's the point of having cameras?
They're like those fake ones you buy at the store, the candy cameras.
They have them.
All you can see, though, are, like, the lights of the speakers and the talk.
You can't see anywhere down on the bottom.
Didn't they say in clips that people usually try to be honest and they think they're being watched?
Very true.
Fuck the dumb little bitches that decided to drive on the shoulder in their Mustang and then merge with traffic.
Somebody did that to me the other day.
I hate that.
Almost fucking slamming into us.
I hate to call anyone a bitch, but they fucking deserved it.
And after almost slamming into us, they laughed like giddy-ass schoolgirls.
Fuck you.
You know, I have an explanation on that.
Fuck big trucks.
We try to run you off the road.
Yeah.
And finally, fuck you to the Queen Kong gorilla girl that fucking butchered my hair.
If my hair slips through your fingers, don't cut my fucking hair, please.
I asked for a trim so I don't look like a hobo while keeping my sort of sideburns and I get half my fucking hair shaved off.
I don't have sideburns and my head looked like a fucking mushroom for three weeks.
Fuck that.
Well, there you go.
Did you see anyone that looked like a mushroom, Zero?
I think this is a new person listening to the show, so hello to Ninja Usagi Koi, which means bunny, does it?
Yes, either that's Koios in love or Koios in fish.
What about Usagi?
Is that bunny?
Is that bunny love?
Ninja bunny love?
Ninja bunny love.
Awesome.
That's cool.
My sister would love you because my sister is a total bunny addict.
Unless it's a Sailor Moon reference, which is weird.
Who knows?
Anyway, I want to send an FU to my friend for playing Involuntary Twister with me on DDR.
Sounds kinky.
Did you get that on film?
Alright.
Let's see.
JB says, my FU goes to SyFam having to be in Italy, so it'll take forever for my customized CD order for them to get there.
An FU to the Safari Trance mix for Jamie sounding blah.
Send it to me anyway.
Send me what you have to find.
You can't mix Safari to Trance.
It doesn't work.
It's like Jungle in the Trance.
Actually, I want to make a suggestion for a new monthly contest.
We haven't even finished the rules for our other one.
Let's finish this one, though, but I have a really good idea.
Finish the Vikings first.
Okay.
VidPawa says, F you to cartoon heroes for being hard.
I agree.
F you to teachers who yell at your class when you haven't done anything wrong.
F you to homework.
F you to research papers.
And finally, F you to people who vandalize apartments that your family owns.
Luckily, no one lives in those apartments.
Yes.
Too much crime in Vegas.
USFVB says, fuck you to every new program.
For some reason they always find the stupidest fucking person to talk to.
Okay.
Okay.
Vandalist says, F you to all the freaking mosquitoes out there.
Amen.
That's like 85% of your friends.
Well, I'll tell you my suggestion during one of the breaks, and we'll see if it's... Okay, we'll do that.
In fact, we'll go ahead and take a quick break right now.
I'm going to bring up some shirt that USFBB gave me a site.
We'll look at that during the break, too.
And we've got the second half of the CyberBeat stuff.
The post-freestyle interview is coming up.
Those should be very interesting.
In the meantime, we're going to take a quick break, and we'll start it off with... I don't know, what?
What should we hear, Jamie?
Let's see.
Um, you know what?
How about in celebration of my very first seven star?
Oh, okay.
Oh, God, I hope I have it.
Uh, I know I do.
I know I do.
I know I do.
I know I do somewhere.
Okay, we'll do that.
Alright, we'll be back.
and many more.
Please listen to Orange Lounge Radio, because real radio makes Captain Jack cry.
That's brilliant.
We posted a link in the chatroom, by the way, which is a shirt that I'm going to make out of a banner that I made a long time ago for Under Sedation Live.
That shirt rules.
They have one.
They have Clit R Us instead of Toys R Us.
Asthma is sexy.
This is my favorite one, though.
On the front, it's a front and back shirt.
On the front, it says, there's two people fucking on the back of my shirt.
And then on the back, it says, just kidding, believe in Jesus.
And it has this picture of Jesus that looks like Buddy Christ or something.
It's great.
And then the other one, where were some of the other ones that were funny?
There's one that's in really small print on the front that says, if you're already this close, why don't you just suck my dick?
Go to the ones that are worse than hell.
I want to see what the really bad ones are.
If these are the bad ones... I used to listen to NSYNC when they were in Underground.
You fucked my mother?
I like that, even Jesus hates greed.
That's great.
Guns don't kill people.
Mario Van Peebles!
Okay.
I like some of the... Hold on, hold on.
I came on on the... Here, here.
I want to see the really bad ones.
I want to see the really bad ones.
Because there's a section called Worse Than Hell.
Let's look at these here.
Ooh, it's purple.
We do not condone purchasing these shirts.
I swear, I didn't know she was three.
I went to Washington, D.C.
and all I got was shot by the sniper.
I fucking hate, oh man, no way am I reading that one, I'll read it, I'll read it, I'll read it, no, no, no, no, no, no, there are some lines even this show can't cross, I'm sorry, Mary had a little lamb with the lamb humping Mary, that's great, here, here, please, hit control D,
Yeah, that one's really bad, Loki.
If you go to the site, you'll know which one we're talking about.
It just starts with I hate dot dot dot and has this whole list.
That's just too much.
Although the punchline's really funny.
I helped fund international terrorism.
That's awful.
Oh no.
Abortions tickle.
That's awful.
There's just some awful shirts here.
This is great.
School Shootings Tour.
It's got all this list.
That's awful.
Oh boy.
The pictures on some of these are awful.
I wouldn't wear that.
I'm sorry, I think this one's funny.
The one that says, I went to Washington, D.C.
and all I got was shot by the sniper.
Now that Jesus did it for the chicks one, I should buy that shirt and wear it to my old church.
Oh, my lord.
One more time for you, Loki.
Okay.
This is, by the way, tshirthell.com.
And we're looking at the worse than hell shirts right now.
Thanks for watching!
Let's see, I can kick your baby's ass.
Potty head.
I enjoy spanking.
I enjoy good spanking.
Smell my diaper.
Fuck the milk, where's the whiskey tits?
My IQ is higher than the president's.
I shit my pants and all I got was a lousy t-shirt.
That's awful!
Are you kidding that?
Are you my daddy?
My pee-pee is bigger than yours.
I hide in my crack in my diaper.
You said I hide in my crack in my diaper?
I hide my crack in my diaper.
Oh my god.
Alright, alright, alright, alright.
Enough of the t-shirt hell.
What were we going to talk about?
We wanted to talk about something when we came back?
Oh, you wanted to talk about some contests I did.
Big Black Cock.
But you want to talk about the contest now or are we going to wait until we wrap up the other contest?
We're going to wrap up the other contest first though, right?
We should start it next month, I think.
Alright.
We're going to have the remix challenge.
Where we give you a song...
and we give you a style and you need to remix the song in the style.
And we will give points to people and we're going to have this running for a whole year.
Okay, so we're going to hear all kinds of neat stuff.
You have a month to finish your particular mix.
Like the one, the last challenge that I gave out, we'll go ahead and extend it.
The Safari Trance Mix.
Sick.
You know, we could do Remember Me, Happy Hardcore.
DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
But, you know, we'll offer this.
We're going to give out points based on how well your mix is.
Whoever has the best, you know, the highest number of points at the end of the year gets a fabulous prize.
I'm not talking about a shit prize.
I'm talking about fabulous.
We don't know what kind of fabulous prize.
Well, I mean, it is a year away.
If we put up enough money, you can get one of those nice DJ-in-a-boxes for like $400 or $300, and it's got two turntables.
Fuck that.
If I'm buying one of those, I'm buying it for me.
Sure.
I was hoping it was going to be for me, but whatever, anyways.
Yeah.
And even hosts can participate, because I'm grading.
So it's all going to be Jamie grading?
So I can enter the remixes?
It'll be me and a panel.
Okay, you and a panel.
A panel of what?
Can you get negative scores?
If it's really bad, yeah.
If it's twin, yeah.
I was waiting for someone to say that.
I'll enter if you can get negative scores, because mine's so bad.
I don't know, I've heard pretty bad.
But anyway, we'll start this up next month.
But first, we've got to finish the rules for our DWI contest we're going to be doing.
That's still going on too.
That's still going on, but we really haven't announced the official rules because we've been lazy and out of town and what have you, drunk, whatever.
But we'll have the full details on that next week, we swear.
The DWI contest where all the DWIs must be to old school TV themes.
Yes, no remixes, no movies, just TV themes.
Didn't we say we were going to allow movies?
I don't know.
Okay, no movies.
We'll have the full rules for you next week.
I'm personally looking forward to seeing one done to the greatest American hero.
Not that you're hinting what's going to get your vote.
No.
I just said I'm looking forward to it.
It doesn't mean I'm actually going to vote for it.
It should be excluded.
Shut up.
Shut up, intern.
Shut up, intern.
Oh, so now Zero X is the official intern.
He's our intern.
Okay, cool.
Because Black Lab is, I'm sorry, Puppy, is our foreign correspondent from the People's Republic of Davis.
He's also our PR bitch.
Yes, our PR bitch.
And so now we have Zero as our intern.
Who else do we have to have a title on this show?
Dave's our mascot.
Dave's our mascot.
Who else?
What's Brad?
Brad is the official Brad.
Bradley is the official Bradley.
Alright, alright.
We'll work on titles later.
Okay, oh yeah, JB is the SyFam horn.
Yes, they're SyFam horns.
Speaking of which, should we get into the cage match now, or do we want to do the second half of the... Okay, we'll do the cage match, then we'll come back and do the second half of the interviews while we tally the votes, maybe?
Actually, no, wait, I still have to find that part in the tape, so it's going to be a little bit, but I'll do that during cage match.
Anyway, okay, then we'll get into the cage match.
Jamie, talk about the cage match, in case we have anyone new listening tonight.
Well, we play songs, each of us picks one.
Um, whichever one won last week, of course, the person who chose that song does not get to choose a new one.
And you use the chat room and vote on what you think is best and it goes into rotation for a week.
It goes into rotation during our Bomani Music Amore program.
Yeah.
Always on this channel when we're not here.
Unless I'm going live.
Or I did a fuck-off this week for the first time in like two weeks.
Ooh, a whole two weeks.
Yeah, a whole two weeks.
I was doing like two a week, wasn't I?
Yeah, you were a fuck-off whore for a while.
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Blink, blink, blink, blink.
Last week on Orange Lounge Radio.
Okay, so let's get into the cage match.
Last week on the cage match, actually two weeks ago, but you guys didn't do a cage match last week, I'm assuming?
No.
Okay, so last time we did a cage match.
So by default, the winner from two weeks ago won last week, just by default, so there was no cage match.
So this is two weeks in a row now.
This is two weeks in a row now, going for its third victory.
And honestly, between you and me, I think this is going to be the first song that has to be retired after four weeks.
I just think it's going to... Just because it happens to be a host involved with the creation of it, I don't think it's ever going to lose.
But... Boost my ego some more.
That's enough.
You don't need no more.
But we have some worthy challengers tonight.
You know why?
This is what we decided to do.
I think Jamie did this too, right?
We let other people pick our songs this week.
Yep, so other people picked our songs for this week.
He was right, I like it.
Alright, let's get into the cage match.
Last week, two weeks ago's winner, this is Loki with the Legend of Trance.
We're just going to play a small clip of it.
ACID3PRO
I don't know, I don't know, I just want to make a remix or something, and I was like, yeah, I'll try that.
I want a sip.
I want a sip of it, because I haven't tried this yet.
Yeah, so I don't know, it's just, I thought about doing that.
I'm working on either, now I was trying to do a Dynamite Rave one, something like that, you know, something trancy, but it's just not, it's not very, it just doesn't work.
It's not sounding too good.
So I'm looking at right now, probably going to be doing a, um,
Dark Black Forest won, and there was another one I was looking at.
I can't remember.
Dark Black Forest was one of them, though, for sure.
Alright, next up, let's play my pick for this week.
However, my pick is actually coming from someone else this week, because I knew nothing I picked was going to beat Loki's.
Love of the Angel
I'm missing love, believe me I'll be someone Wish you love me, oh baby girl Why you ask me to fall in love with you Take me to the soul, to the soul of the angel Like a blind light in my mind Take me my life, to the top to feel alright
Thank you for watching!
Sorry about that, I was queuing up the second half of the interviews there.
Sorry about that.
Well, the interviews are all queued up now.
We'll get to that after the game.
Alright, that was KK, Jungle Girls, I don't remember their full name.
DJ Kong, thank you.
King Kong and Jungle Girls.
With Love of the Angels.
The Jungle Girls.
That wasn't a bad tune, I liked it.
Let's go around and see everybody else's thoughts.
Sorry, we had the music full volume there.
Sorry about that.
Let's go around and get everyone else's thoughts on that song.
80s fabulous, but not 80s fabulous enough.
I don't know, I give it like a 7.
It was pretty good for what it was supposed to sound like, but it wasn't nothing that really caught my attention.
I'd actually go ahead and give it an 8, because I think it would be a pretty decent DDR song.
It would be pretty cool in DDR.
And, you know, I have a feeling, just because there's some meanings behind this for some folks in the chatroom, there might be some votes coming this way for Love the Angels.
So, who knows?
I think they're trying everything they can to dethrone Legend of Trance.
Alright, oh.
Jamie's going to bring it.
Alright, Jamie, what are you bringing to the cage match tonight?
Alright, this was my favorite Belinda Carlyle song, Heaven is a Place on Earth.
This is a remix by Wild Side.
Alright, this is Wild Side with Heaven is a Place on Earth.
Jamie's pick for this week's cage match.
Enjoy.
Ooh, baby, do you know that's where Ooh, heaven is a place on earth This ain't heaven, love goes first We'll make heaven
Oh baby, do you know that's where Oh heaven is
All righty, that's the last pick.
Wild Side with Heaven is a Place on Earth.
Let's go around and get your thoughts on that.
Jamie!
Ten.
I give it a nine.
I just like speed mixes, so I will give it a seven.
But I have a DWI for it, so I give it a 7.5.
You know, that was pretty good.
I'm beginning to like Wildside a lot.
If you didn't recognize the name at first, they're the same band that did Irresistible from DDR Extreme.
They're pretty good.
Now, see, yeah, so they're getting some good stuff.
It was a pretty good mix.
I'll give it an 8.
8 for 80.
80s.
So, not too bad.
Alright, so here you go again.
You can start sending your votes now.
Send them over private message to Sky in the chatroom or over email.
Here, once again, are your choices.
Last week's winner, Legend of Trance by Loki.
Or you can vote for Love of the Angel.
Or you can vote for Wild Side with Heaven is a Place on Earth.
Alright, send those votes right now.
Alright.
Okay, so there you go.
But not the four with a rainbow.
Well, Wendell's through the whole damn thing.
If you listen to the special on Friday, Saturday, Wendell's in the whole damn thing.
So he didn't need a special interview.
Yeah, that was great.
I mean, hey, if you were... We were first.
Just goes to show, we stay on top of shit.
If you stay tuned into Orange Lounge and you're on the net, you're going to be the first to hear about all these news, especially when big tournaments are going on.
Because we got you covered.
We got you covered.
All right.
Here we go.
Second half of the interviews.
Alright, it's 5.47pm on Sunday, and they've just announced all the winners for freestyle.
Taking home Max 2 Machine, Bruce Leroy, and lots of great routines.
Honestly, any of these routines would have won a normal tournament.
I'm going to go around and see if I can't get some reaction from some folks.
We'll see what we can get here.
I'm standing here with JP Money, who came in, I believe, 7th place, right, with his routine?
Fabulous, fabulous ending to your routine, by the way, with all the money.
Where'd that idea come from?
Um, actually, that was brought to my attention by the minds of my, of my, uh, the people staying in the room, my roommates, there you go, that's what I was looking for.
And I, you know, I thought it was pretty clever, so I'm like, you know, why not?
So how did you feel about the tournament today?
Oh, man, everybody performed, performed really good.
I was, I'm really happy with the way it turned out.
and I'm happy that it ended on such a high note.
How are you going to celebrate today?
I don't know.
Me and my friends tonight are going to go somewhere.
We're going to hang, probably go crazy, just as we always do.
Alright, sounds good.
Thanks for talking to us.
Anything else you want to say?
No, not really.
Thank you.
Alright, cool.
Later.
Later.
All right, I'm staying here with the AJ Sweet Banana, who's taking home third place.
Awesome routine.
Definitely would have been in my top three, too.
How'd you feel about today?
Pretty good.
Not bad for a week's worth of procrastination, but yeah.
Everything, a lot of stuff here will be on eBay eventually, because I have a lot of it at home, but yeah.
It's okay, because it's cool, and I have Ikaruga.
How did you exactly, now you kind of crammed two really awesome freestyle routines.
How exactly did you go about cramming?
Were you up all night, or...
Uh, yeah, six hours of sleep, woke up early at Godin's house over here.
And, uh, yeah, practiced in his living room, that kind of thing.
I forgot a few things, you'll probably see them on videos, but that's fine.
It's all in the fun, it's all in the entertainment, it's all about the game, yeah.
What's next for you?
Uh, a break for college, maybe do something for B3, the coming up tournament, and, uh, yeah, focus on school because I've got a psych test tomorrow.
Oh, crap, that's the one you ought to have been cramming for, huh?
Yeah, and shout out to anyone who sees my iBook.
It has been stolen, and yeah, I lost my iBook here.
It's stolen from behind the pre-reg thing, but it's alright.
You know, I got something in return.
It's all good.
Yeah, alright, anything else you want to say to folks out there listening?
Uh, just, if you're playing the game, have fun, that's all there is to it.
Alright, thanks, have a good celebration tonight.
Alright, thanks.
Does anyone know if AJ found his iBook?
Let us know, we're curious, because that sucks to have stuff stolen.
Yeah, that's ass.
Bad people.
Naughty.
Alright, now we're talking to the winner.
Say hello to Bruce Leroy, everybody.
Hey everybody, what's going on?
How's it feel?
Man, it feels amazing.
I came out here and my first round was really kind of a disappointment for me.
I kind of choked a little bit.
I knew I just had to represent at this point.
I had faith in this routine.
Lookin' Up A Rock is a very fast song.
It required a lot of dedication.
It came through and it came together.
I didn't blank out like I did yesterday.
Thank God for that.
Everyone felt the moves.
That was the main part.
The crowd felt me.
That was the main thing that put me over the edge.
I filled the song, communicated with the song, and the song communicates through me.
That's how I try to do it.
Definitely.
I totally agree.
Was there anything you did to prepare for today's routine?
Um, definitely, um, I watched, um, Sammy Davis Jr.
was a tremendous influence, um, as was Fred Astaire and Gene Kelly.
Um, I watched a lot of their footage, like, Singing in the Rain, stuff like that.
Um, yeah, and then, you know, throwing in a bit of my own stuff, I really tried to feel the song, you know?
A lot of times people do routines, and they'll fight the song with their moves, and you gotta, you gotta let the song tell you what to do, so.
Another question on everybody's mind, what the hell are you gonna do with that machine?
I'm going to try my best to get it up to NorCal, put it in my apartment, and I'm telling you, one quarter for five songs, dude.
You live upstairs or downstairs?
I live upstairs.
Oh, shit.
And the maintenance man lives above me, so he's going to be pissed off.
That's right, dude.
After I do something, I'll have to put a cushion under it or something, dude, because it's going to drive him crazy.
Alright, well, congratulations.
Any other final thoughts going through your mind right now?
Um...
No, I thank everybody.
It's all about the people that love me and accept me for who I am and what I do and what I dance.
I'm just entirely grateful, dude.
Everybody loves Bruce Leroy.
Give me a hug, Bruce Leroy.
Give me a hug, baby.
All right, yeah.
Much love, yeah, yeah.
Oh, my God, yes.
All right, we'll be back.
All right, I'm sitting here with the Master42 who came in second place.
How do you feel about today's tournament?
Oh, it was so much fun.
I'm just so glad that I got to compete here with everybody and got a chance for everyone to see the skills and just to portray.
The event here is just so awesome.
Everybody's tournament and their performance is just really, really strong.
Now you decided to go a little OG with your routine.
How did you go about picking your song?
Well, I remember when I first started learning about freestyling, I downloaded videos off the internet and I saw this group, this Korean group called A-Team, and they performed to this song.
And I thought it was just the awesomest thing ever.
I was like, oh my gosh, that's incredible.
How did they do that?
You and Master42, DarkSakura, could be great friends.
Ah, classics.
I actually incorporated one of their moves from that video, and I've just loved that song ever since.
So what's going through your head right now?
What are you going to do with the prize?
I'm going to go home and play on it, dude.
I had an American version of the PlayStation, and I actually tried to bring American DDR steps to play here, but I learned at the last moment that they wouldn't actually work.
I needed a Japanese version of DDR.
So now I have that, so now for the next tournament, I won't be in that same pickle.
Alright, so what's next for you?
Are you going to be doing tournaments?
Are you going to take a break?
More tournaments in the future?
Yeah, I heard there's a tournament coming up in July that has a freestyle aspect, so I'm going to check that out.
I don't think it'll be as big as CyberZone, but it'll be something to look forward to.
Sounds good.
And how are you celebrating tonight?
We speculate, by the way, that July tournament that Master42 references could possibly be actually a really big tournament.
I think March Madness is going to be a qualifier.
Yeah, this might be a big deal.
More details to come on that one.
Guys, we're going down to Roscoe's for chicken and waffles.
Roscoe's!
Yeah, that's right, that's right!
We want, we want Roscoe's!
Yeah!
So I think we're going to head down there for some chicken and waffles.
Alright, anything else you want to say to the fine folks listening?
Just congratulations to everyone, and take up DDR.
You might feel funky at first, but it's the best game in the world, man.
It gets you laid like you can't believe.
Yeah, totally, man.
It does?
What the hell am I doing wrong?
Alright, thanks for talking to us.
Alright, thanks a lot, man.
Fucked up.
And he forgot to have the third place match.
Whoa, that went into Fremont interviews because I used the same tape there.
Alright, that was it.
That was all the interviews that we did that night.
And then right after that, we headed over to Roscoe's.
And in the special, you're going to actually hear some stuff taped at Roscoe's, including you'll hear the waiter was in on their...
and I believe, I don't remember if I got Wendell's speech or not.
Wendell, we did a shot, we did maple syrup shots, basically.
Us at our table, we did shots because the waiter gave us the idea.
He was talking about crazy customers that did shots of it.
We all did a shot and did a toast.
It was a beautiful moment.
Roscoe's was actually one of the highlights.
Did it make you choke?
No, it tasted like... Actually...
The hell with the tournament!
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Very cool.
That was cool.
And all the white faces.
We literally took over like half of Roscoe's.
We had all the people, because this was a Sunday night, we had all the people on the one side coming back from church, coming to get their grits and their greens, and then they had us, just crazy kids there.
Are we going to go to a break?
We're going to go to a break, and when we come back, we'll announce the winner of this week's cage match.
And, yeah, won't that be exciting?
Loki, say something to stretch time here while I load up something for the break.
Say something.
Yeah, something.
Your mom.
Alright, we'll play the song that won the tournament.
Bruce Leroy used this song for his routine at Rules.
Great, great routine.
Manika Niko Rock.
Enjoy.
Alright, if you didn't recognize those, those were the top three freestyle songs right there.
First place was Manic Ningo Rock, second place was Brilliant to Your Orchestral Groove, and third place was Let's Get Down.
Those were the songs that the folks did their routines to in one cyberbeat.
Okay, we're going to take things in a different direction now.
We're going to play a song from Dance Mania EX2.
This is an interesting trance cover of your song.
Let us know what you think of this.
This is interesting.
When we come back, we're going to announce the winner of the cage match and this week's list list.
It's going to be cool.
Thanks for watching!
From StepSquad to Orange Labs, this PDR sucks!
Holla!
P.S.
TTPO
Alright, that was Obsession from Dance Mania EX2 with your song.
And I think Jamie just about vomited during that.
I tried to ignore it.
I blocked it out.
We were looking at my afterburner.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Hey!
My foot wins.
Now, you guys, I have to admit, I think a lot of you... We got way less votes than we usually do this week.
I think just zero wins.
I vote for zero.
We vote for zero.
I got way less votes than I usually do for Cage Match, but you know, it just happens sometimes.
And I begged, I pleaded, but we got all the votes.
I didn't even pay attention to you adding them up.
And so, yeah, I know this is actually going to be a surprise to everyone, but folks, we added up the votes.
And the winner...
is a little bit surprising.
The winner, you guys, is Wild Side with Heaven is a Place on Earth.
I love all of you.
I love all of you.
I'd like to dedicate this victory to all the little people that stepped on all the waves.
That's the winner.
I begged for votes.
Alright, so it was a close one, though.
And, uh, funny enough, Loki, Loki, I thought it was gonna be the whole month.
You came in dead last in that vote.
Sorry.
There's only seven people that voted.
Where is everybody?
That's what I wanna know.
Don't know, don't know what to tell ya.
Alright, so, uh, but Loki, you know what that means?
That means you just gotta go make another remix.
I don't know what I was going to do anyways.
You should do a 5-1-1 speed mix.
Uh, no.
Alright, there it is.
Winner of the cage match.
Wild side, heaven has placed on earth.
Okay.
Now we're going to do a segment on this show, you know it, you love it.
We do it damn near every week, but god damn it, it's just so popular, so much fun to do, we're doing it again.
Listless, ladies and gentlemen.
Tonight's topic... Loki, tell us the topic for tonight.
It's the best 8-bit Nintendo game.
Yay!
Squee!
Remember, this is NES, not Game Boy.
Yes, NES only.
8-bit Nintendo games only.
Okay.
Since every serious gamer knows the Nintendo was the only system that mattered and still does matter.
I beg to differ.
The Sega Master System was pretty fabulous.
It had some of the best games.
We were both saying this.
They had the best version of Fantasy Zone.
Fantasy Zone, if you have never played it, emulate it, find somebody who has it, and just sit in front of the TV for an hour and play it, and you'll love it.
And if you've ever played Samba de Amigo, it has the Opa Opa song.
Well, no, but also, for anyone who's ever seen my quote on my banner on DDR Freak and the one I used to have on Sack of Remani, it's, welcome to the Fantasy Zone.
Get ready.
We all know what game that came from.
Um...
Space Harrier, because Space Harrier was in the Fantasy Zone, as in from the old game.
Oh my gosh, I forgot about that, because I haven't played that game in so long.
Why else do you think the whole game was pastel with a checkered floor?
Okay.
Alright, here we go.
Who's going to start us off tonight?
You.
Me?
Alright, I'll start.
My pick for best 8-bit Nintendo game ever is a little weird, but you've got to represent, you've got to know your roots.
You have to know your roots.
My number three pick for best Nintendo game ever is Dance Aerobics.
Freak.
You know, when you said going back to your roots, I was thinking that you were going to start playing RuPaul.
No.
You better work.
Cover girl.
No.
RuPaul did a song called Back to My Roots.
Oh, really?
About getting hairdressed.
Oh, no.
I only know the Supermodel song.
Sorry.
Dance Aerobics is my number three pick simply because DDR is a complete ripoff of Dance Aerobics.
I have one pick.
My number three pick... Now keep in mind it only came out in Japan, but because it was on the Famicom it counts.
Kid Dracula!
And you can download the emulator in the ROM!
Kid Dracula is Jamie's number three pick.
Zero.
Like, my number three was Hogan's Alley.
Hogan's Alley.
That was the first game where you could actually shoot innocent people if you got really bored of trying to shoot the little spinny flipping board evil guys.
Oh, Huzz?
That is so cool, though.
Hogan's Alley, and already the chatroom is going crazy saying all these games have to be mentioned, and I already know none of them are gonna get mentioned.
Just because our picks are off the wall, I know these people.
We gotta go back to our roots here.
Uh-oh.
Okay, we're going with the best all-time fucking game ever, Contra.
Contra!
But no way, the Japanese version was better because the trees moved.
I hate you.
That was my number two pick.
was it really?
uh oh alright Mega Man 2 was my second favorite but you can take a suggestion from the chat room there's plenty of suggestions if you want to see that
Alright, then Mega Man 2.
The reason why I say Mega Man 2 and not Mega Man 1, just because I think the series... Mega Man 2 was the top of the series.
Mega Man 2 was when it really started to take off.
That's really the one that everybody, you know, all the other Mega Mans were a rip-off of, was Mega Man 2.
Two words.
Two words.
Big shades.
Metal blades.
Metal blades.
Alright, Mega Man 2 is my number two pick.
Jamie, what's your number two pick?
I would shoot myself if I didn't mention it since you took my number two favorite.
Legend of Zelda.
Alright, going to just what you know, The Legend of Zelda.
It's a very popular game.
Because I hated Zelda 2.
You know, a lot of the chat room would agree with you with it.
Really.
I like Zelda 2.
I appreciate Zelda 2.
Zelda 2 is more like playing an RPG, but The Legend of Zelda was just like, oh my god.
You know, and I would actually have almost mentioned Metroid, except I suck at Metroid, so Zelda.
And you know, I like Zelda 2 a lot.
What's funny is that Nintendo sequels kind of did that.
You had Mario Bros.
2, it was completely different than Mario Bros.
1.
Zelda 2 wasn't even a Mario game.
I know, I know it wasn't a Mario game.
Zelda 2, okay, his sword was like a little dagger.
It was like, it was pathetic.
Pathetic dagger.
I mean, I think he's like, I'm Polkino with the dagger!
Polkino with the dagger!
Although I did like that in Super Smash Bros., they gave him his Zelda 2 moves, which made more sense for a fighting game.
Dude, in Zelda 2, his sword looked like a penis.
Yeah!
My number two, it wasn't really popular, but Arkanoid
Arkanoid!
Yeah, Breakout also.
It was the most redundant game in the world, and you got really pissed off when you couldn't pass the third level and had to start all over again.
Yeah, but at least the Nintendo one was a little more colorful, though.
That's what's best in Out of the Clean Area.
I'm a master on Destructo Match now.
Anyway, we'll talk Neopets later.
I want to talk about Waste of Time websites at the end of the show, because we have some new ones coming up this week.
Time to bring out the big guns.
Castlevania 2, Simon's Quest.
Excellent.
Excellent.
The only Castlevania... No, not the only Castlevania matters, because we have the whole Dracula X series.
Simon was the hero of all the Belmonts and the non-Belmonts.
You know what just pissed me off is the fact that with the Captain N cartoon, they made Simon Belmont into this pretentious asshole.
Don't let me forget to get you a ROM of Konami World for the Famicom, because there's a Castlevania 2 level in it.
The Konami World games are winner, but they're too obscure for anyone to know anything about.
All right, moving on.
Okay, now we got the number one choice.
My number one choice for greatest 8-bit Nintendo game ever, Blaster Master.
We all know the grenade trick, don't we?
Absolutely.
The sequels to Blaster Master, they don't exist to me.
They are ass.
Somebody needs to make a really good sequel to Blaster Master that plays just like the original.
That game was the shit.
The end.
Although it technically... We know who should do it.
Treasure.
And they should do it like the way they did Bungaio.
I have no idea what that is.
You don't know what Treasure is?
I've never played it.
Treasure is the best video game manufacturing group ever.
They did Gunstar Heroes.
Oh, okay.
They did Radiant Silvergun.
Oh, okay, yeah, okay.
Oh, you should have just said the people that did Radiant Silvergun.
I don't know.
Treasure.
Treasure.
Yeah, no, whoosh.
Oh, well.
Okay, but technically, actually, I just have to say is that my number one would really be the same thing that Jamie's putting for her number one, but I already knew she was going to put it, so I didn't have to, so I said something else.
All right.
Guardian Legend, fuck yeah.
The Guardian Legend!
Best game ever.
Tonight was like my first time seeing that game, and I saw like five minutes of it, and I think it was one of the coolest games ever.
A lot of people don't know about the Guardian Legend.
Tell Jamie, Jamie, tell them.
It has Lola Lala Lala in it.
I know, but tell them about the Guardian Legend, how it works.
Guardian Legend is a combination shooting game, adventure game.
Like, yeah, shooting, oh god.
If you thought R-Type was hard...
Thanks for watching!
Guardian Legend, you know, you start off flying your way into this planet, and the planet is this whole mechanized planet, and then you run around, and by the way, it's a girl, which is cool, and you run around, and you shoot things, and you find weapons, and you go, you actually gain levels.
You find ships, and you gain levels.
The more things you kill, the higher levels you get, so it has the RPG element in it, too.
And by the way, you find little shops with these blue aliens, and it's Lolo and Lala from Adventures of Lolo.
And, you know,
And then, you know, you find these little levels, and the way that the levels are set up, you have your entry level, which is level 0, then you have 1, 10, 2, 20, or, you know, like that.
It was 1, 11, didn't it?
It wasn't 11, 12?
Yeah, it was 1, 11.
It was 1, 11.
Because when you get to level 10, it's 10, 20.
Which were, by the way, the freaking hardest levels in the universe.
Awesome game.
I have beaten that game all of once.
Beautiful game.
I can beat the last level of the game.
I can breeze my way through.
Because once you get the backfire weapon, you just sit in a corner and shoot it with the backfire weapon.
And by the way, your game counselor tip of the day, use TGL as your password to bypass the Zelda-ish part of the game.
It also had an unbreakable password system.
Trust me, no one has been able to break this password system.
You know, I could figure out all the Mega Man ones, like, you know, no problem, but no one can break the Guardian Legends password system.
But if you put in TGL, you can bypass all the adventure levels, and you play it just like a shooter.
In between levels, you get your special weapons and what you normally would have gotten if you keep going on.
All right.
Enough about whoring out that boy.
We spent a lot of time on that one.
It's obvious we're a little biased here.
Sorry.
Zero, what's your number one pick?
Okay, my number one pick was Super Mario Bros.
3.
Because it was, I don't know, it was just like the best one.
It almost seemed like it was kind of ahead of its time when it came to getting all the different suits and stuff.
And plus, the first time anyone ever saw it was in the greatest movie ever.
Yeah.
and The Wizard.
The Wizard is the coolest movie in history.
If you haven't seen it, go buy it.
The Power Glove.
It's so bad.
Go rent it.
Get your Power Glove off her.
Yeah, what was the point?
Have a Power Glove.
I don't even think it was that useful.
I think he used it for like two things and that was it.
I want the left hand and the right hand one, so I could do, like, try to figure out how to weak punch out to it.
That would be so cool, isn't it?
Or the, you can use, remember the U-Force?
Yeah.
That thing, all you could use it on was, like, Rad Racer, and that was it.
It was pretty retarded.
You should wire two power gloves, okay, wire it to, like, you know, the DDR type thing, and just play DDR with your hands.
Yeah, well, the one problem is the left-handed Power Glove is so, like, unbelievably rare that if you find one, you can easily sell it on eBay for $100.
People are, like, I've seen the Power Glove on eBay already for a couple, for, like, $500.
They're just a right.
For, like, $500, you can't find them anywhere.
You should... You should check on your fans what they're doing for you.
I do indeed have two Power Gloves.
Alright, uh, my pick.
There's like tons of choices.
Tons of choices.
Um... Get your Power Glove off her!
Well, you know, it's kind of an... Ah!
He touched my breast!
That was great.
Oh, man.
Did Drew touch your breast?
No.
One of my favorite games on the Nintendo had to have been... I don't know, I go back and play it now and it's just like, okay, whatever.
Bionic Commando.
Do you ever read Old Schooled?
The guy from Bionic Commando hangs out in the bar with all the other Nintendo characters and he's like their hero because his bionic arm can reach out and grab beer from across the hall.
Anything else you want to...
That game was cool because you didn't have an arm, you had this giant claw thing that grabbed on stuff, and you couldn't jump because I guess the arm weighed too much, and there's these guys that looked all the same, but they were different shades of color, but they were different people, and stuff happened, and if you got caught by the people, then more people came.
And it had the best ending.
You blew up Hitler.
Yeah, and you blew up Hitler.
The fact, also, you could choose your path, too.
And, like, you could say, I want to go this way, to, like, B or K, and then bounce all around, and it's pretty fun.
You said BK, and I started thinking of British Nights.
I started thinking of Burger King.
Hold on!
I gotta, I'm sorry, you know, I like Bionic Commando, but there's just something that just got flashing in my mind.
One of the best games ever, and I need to change mine.
I'm sorry.
You wanna change that one, or you wanna change one of your other ones?
You wanna change Contra, Castlevania II?
Change Contra.
Oh, okay.
Alright, what are we putting on instead of Contra, then?
You know, this might be a bad decision, but Marble Madness.
Marble Madness!
Best game ever, and I wish they'd make it on a new system, but they haven't yet.
It's on the Atari collection for the, um, or no, the Midway collection for, uh, PlayStation, and you can actually get the PlayStation track while we got one.
I can't believe he just took off Contra to put in Marble Madness.
Alright, let's read the list.
Here we go.
The list so far, Dancer Aerobics, Kid Dracula, Hogan's Alley, Marble Madness, Mega Man 2, The Legend of Zelda, Arknoid, Castlevania II, Simon's Quest, Blaster Master, The Guardian Legends, Super Mario Bros.
3, and Bionic.
Now let's go through those glaring omissions according to our chat room that we left off of the list.
I know they're going to say Metroid.
Metroid, the most obvious.
Metal Gear.
Nobody said Metal Gear.
Final Fantasy.
Adventure Island.
RoboCop.
Gyro Mike, come on.
Burger Time.
You can squash the professor, that's a good point.
Dragon Warrior.
Yeah.
Dragon Warrior 4.
Just because it had a slime.
Bubble Bobble.
Bubble Bobble is a kick-ass game, however the NES translation just was not the same as the arcade.
If we were talking about like best 80s arcade game maybe, I'd put Bubble Bobble on there, but not for best Nintendo game.
Kickle Cubicle.
Kickle Cubicle was pretty cool.
And, and, and, Fantasy Zone.
Kid Icarus, Ice Climber, Battletoads, River City Ransom, Double Dragon Star Tropics, Mario Tennis Don't mention any stupid Virtual Boy games because they all give me a headache.
I'm just kind of scrambling lists.
Oh, and then last, we have Adventures of Lolo.
Hey, I mentioned it.
I have bad memory.
No, I'm just kidding.
Clu Clu Land.
I have psychological damage every time.
No, I'm kidding.
I can play Clu Clu Land on Animal Crossing.
I can play Balloon Fight on Animal Crossing.
Kid Icarus, did I say that already?
Yes.
Kid Icarus, Mike Tyson's Punch Out.
Remember, here's your other pro tip of the day for Kid Icarus.
It's Icarus fights Medusa Angels.
When I find a place to upload it, I'm going to upload my DWI to the Mike Tyson's Punch-Out!!
remix.
There's like urbic DWI to it, it took me like 30 minutes, but it was really good.
And it has the instruction manual as the background.
That's great.
Alrighty.
Okay, so now we gotta vote stuff off.
This is gonna be very difficult tonight, you guys.
It's gonna be very difficult.
I guess I have to start, huh?
Yeah.
Uh, well, you're all going to hate me.
I'm taking off Marble Madness.
The reason why, no, I have good justification.
Because Marble Madness was way too short.
It was only six levels.
The thrill was gone in a day.
I just can't, nah, I can't let it be there.
Marble Madness is really only worthy to play if you have the trackball.
Which is why I was very lucky to hit Toys R Us when they were clearing out their trackballs for like 75% off for the PlayStation.
Me, Dance Aerobics Because I sprained my ankle playing that game I have painful memories of Dance Aerobics This sucks, because the two obvious ones are gone now
I will take off my own, Hogan's Alley.
It was fun, but it's not one of the very best games ever.
Amazingly enough, first time in the history of this show, if I'm not mistaken, somebody took their own item off the list.
No.
No?
We did Listless last week.
Oh, did you all do that or something?
I forgot what we did it about, but everybody but me took off Best Liquor.
Oh, God, you guys.
Everybody but me took off one of their own.
I stand corrected.
One thing I can't believe we all forgot was Excitebike.
Even though it was short, even though it was short, it was still a classic.
Excitebike was awesome, but it badly needed an update.
Well, I guess some say that Uniracers is supposed to be a sequel to Excitebike.
I don't buy that.
And the 64 version was absolutely horrible.
I never played that.
Oh, God.
It was stupid.
Oh, well.
Actually, no.
There was one on Game Boy.
I think it was Motocross Maniacs or something that played kind of similar.
But it was ass.
All right.
Loki, last one coming off.
What is it?
Just Arkanoid because I don't like that game.
All right.
Arkanoid comes off the list.
It was either there or Kid Dracula because Kid Dracula just reminds me of that stupid little vampire movie.
Thank God I hate that little vampire movie.
Jamie's going to make him play now.
All right, here we go.
This is the list.
Send in your votes right now.
Kid Dracula, Mega Man 2, The Legend of Zelda, Castlevania II, Simon's Quest, Blaster Master.
I read those.
Oh, okay.
Sorry.
I read those.
You were too busy getting mad at Loki.
All right, then start from the top.
Hold on, I'm going to post this in the chat room.
All right, start from the top.
Best 8-bit game ever.
Kid Dracula, Mega Man 2, The Legend of Zelda, Castlevania 2, Simon's Quest, Blaster Master, The Guardian Legend, Super Mario Bros.
3, and Bionic Commando.
Alright, send in your votes right freaking now.
In the meantime, we're going to take a quick break.
We'll be back.
We've got some brief announcements and reminders, a message, and other things.
Yeah, more people need to vote than voted on the cage match, because you guys got a surprise thing in there, because nobody voted on cage match, so y'all better be voting for listless.
Okay, we'll be right back after we hear this 8th style song that makes me wet.
Just kidding.
Okay.
Thanks for watching!
Thank you for watching!
Thanks for watching!
Thanks for watching!
Let's listen in on an Orange Lounge Radio staff meeting.
Do you want to be accepted by Hollywood?
No!
Do we care what people think of us?
No!
Do we want people to kiss our ass?
Yes!
Extreme Bomani Radio.
That's us, Orange Lounge Radio.
We're back.
Wrapping up episode number 34 here in this final segment.
I heard a funny joke.
Irene and Brad told me a funny joke today.
I thought we'd have joke time on Orange Lounge Radio.
So here we go.
Knock, knock.
Interrupting cow.
That's like totally from South Park.
Is it really?
Yeah, it's from... The other retarded kid, I forget his name.
I still like the muffin joke.
Damn it!
I didn't know that was from South because I stopped watching South Park because I didn't even know they were making new ones anymore.
Damn.
Oh, you want me to tell the muffin joke?
I want to tell it.
Alright.
You remember the muffin joke?
Have you heard the muffin joke?
Okay.
I'll give Ryan the other mic.
Alright.
Two muffins are baking in the oven.
And one of the other muffins goes, Oh my god, we're cooking, we're burning!
The other one goes, Oh shit, a talking muffin.
Oh my god.
Yeah.
Thank you, Irene.
Alright.
I feel stupid now that I know that joke came from South Park, Jesus Christ.
You wanna talk about a stupid joke, but it was kinda, it was funny the way it was said?
Has anybody seen Catch Me If You Can?
No.
There's a part where Tom Hanks is sitting there with a bunch of other FBI agents, and he's all, why don't you tell a joke?
And he's all, okay, he's all, knock knock, and all, who's there?
And he goes, go fuck yourself.
And that was the end of the joke.
Right.
You know what was a joke?
Those pictures of the person playing DDR just as Sakura.
That was cute.
That was cute.
That was a cute routine.
Yeah.
That was good costume.
Yeah, it was cool.
It wasn't a joke.
It was serious time, man.
CyberBeat Special
I'm not hooked on it I'm not hooked on it Alright, here we go Number 3, by your vote, listless, here it is Number 3, best 8-bit game ever, drumroll Is Super Mario Bros.
3 Or as the guy in the wizard said, Super Mario Bros.
3 Okay
Number two, best Nintendo game ever.
Did you give a drum roll?
Yes.
The Legend of Zelda.
Alright, and the best Nintendo game ever, as voted by you guys, Mega Man 2 is the winner.
Mega Man 2 is the best Nintendo game ever, according to the chat room.
Alright.
Guardian Legend didn't get a single vote.
How the hell did that happen?
It's mostly because people play all the mainstream games.
Like Blaster Master is mainstream as it was.
See, that's why I was surprised because I didn't think anybody in here was going to end up putting a mainstream.
When I was listening to the number three choices, I'm like, nobody's going to put a mainstream game on here.
And then all of a sudden the number ones were all mainstream.
I wasn't going to put a bunch of other ones.
But no one really played Arkanoid or Hogan's Alley.
I played Arkanoid.
It just was an arcade game.
And I played Hogan's Alley.
All you bitches need to go play Guardian Legend.
It's all about bad dudes.
Oh, jeez.
What was the one which had, like, a fat lady as a boss?
Was that Rampage?
Or not Rampage?
Renegade.
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Best game ever.
Super Dodgeball.
It was one of the two of your games.
Ikari Warriors, because it always glitched out when we played it.
We used to get dust on the game just to see how badly it'd glitch out.
It was awesome.
No, it was all about pro wrestling.
The one where you had, like, one kick and one punch.
Yeah.
All right.
Oh, we had another joke in the chat room.
This is pretty funny.
John Fields submitted this joke.
Okay, two guys are hunting in the woods.
One gets hurt and the other goes 9-1-1.
The operator says, okay, well, let's make sure he's hurt.
There's silence, then a gunshot.
Guy comes back on and says, okay, what now?
Have I ever told the story of the poo-poo bird?
That joke seems right to me.
I'm sure he's...
He says, my friend's dead.
And they're all, well, first make sure that he's dead, you know.
And then he kills him.
Has anyone here ever heard the story of the Foo Poo Bird?
You're such a bitch, Loki.
Have you heard the story of the Foo Poo Bird?
No.
Okay.
These three great explorers have hunted this legendary bird called the Foo Poo Bird.
The legend is that this bird is making people disappear, but no one knows how.
So they go into the deep, deep, deep, deep jungle.
And two of them are together, and one of them is by himself, because this one by himself thinks that he's just shit.
Well, anyway, he's walking along, and he hears... There's a big wad of bird shit on his head.
He does a little crap.
He wipes it off, and he disappears.
Ooh, scary.
So the other two are together, and sure enough, they hear... And one of them gets shit on his head.
So he wipes it off, and he disappears, and his friend goes, Oh my god, that's how it happens!
But right before he gets to the end of the course...
and he gets crap on his head.
So he's smart though.
He's not wiping it off.
So he goes home with a big pile of poo on his head.
You know, he gets the best place to sit on the bus and everything.
He's, you know, in bed with his wife and his wife goes, you need to wipe that crap off your head.
He's like, no, but if I do, I'll disappear and you'll never see me again.
Oh, well, I love you and we'll leave the crap on your head.
I can live with that.
But the stench gets so bad that later on in the night she's like, I can't stand this.
She wipes off his head.
Oh my god, that was the most awful thing ever.
Thank you for wasting everybody's time.
Okay.
Oh, that was the best joke and you know it.
No, the muffin joke's the best joke.
A new chatter in the chatroom, Bizarro17, starts off a joke, says, So I said to the prickly cactus, and that was it.
There's no prickly cactus.
Okay.
Alright, we've only got a few minutes left in the show.
One thing I definitely want to say, a little special message out there.
One of our biggest supporters in the world... Wash behind your ears.
Yeah, wash behind your ears.
Always floss.
No, eat your veggies.
Alright, no, seriously.
Yes, one of our most faithful listeners, DDR Angel, who I believe has the most lines in chat out of everybody right now, currently.
She's just a great supporter of the show, helps us make promos, she was here for an episode a couple months ago.
She's leaving for a few months and she won't be around, so she's going to Japan.
Oh boo hoo, she has to go to Japan.
Poor thing.
Is she listening right now?
Yes, of course she's listening.
Send me an email and I'll give you my address so that we can write while you're in Japan.
Yeah, okay, that'll be fun.
I mean, email is one thing, but I want to send letters.
Okay, cool.
Yeah, send us stuff.
That'll be fun.
So, Angel's going off to Japan, so have a great time.
We'll miss you.
Get listeners for our show while you're in Japan.
And have a fabulous time.
We'll miss you.
What?
No, that was pretty... That was the announcement.
Yep.
Yep.
Oh yeah, the Sak Bomani thing.
You were supposed to announce that on the show too.
Well, let me just wrap up the Angel thing.
What, the winner?
Yeah.
Oops.
What, you didn't tabulate the votes in time or something?
Actually, I did.
The winner.
Everyone likes JB's.
So JB, get it the hell finished so we can put it up.
Alright, but Loki, you know what?
I'm thinking that design that you did may not go to waste, because I'm thinking maybe it's time to renovate the Orange Lounge site again.
I actually want to use that for March Madness.
Alright, we'll figure it out.
I don't know, I just need something that loads faster on my site, and I think it loads pretty damn fast, so we'll see.
God, Jesus, and St.
Peter are golfing.
St.
Peter steps up to the tee.
He takes a big swing.
He hits the ball.
It goes up into the air.
It lands ten feet from the cup.
Jesus steps up.
He takes a huge swing.
The ball goes flying.
It lands two feet from the cup.
God steps up, he takes the biggest swing you could ever see, the ball piddles off the tee.
All of a sudden, a weasel comes out and picks the ball up, runs off, an eagle comes by, picks the weasel up and flies away, a hurricane comes by, blows the eagle back, and the eagle drops the weasel.
And, hold on, because it's a little bit here.
Oh yeah, the weasel drops the ball, the ball rolls into the cup, Jesus looks at God and says, Are you gonna play golf or are you just gonna fuck around?
You're going to hell for that, that's pretty funny.
Yeah, well, we're all going to hell.
If you listen to this show, you're probably going to hell.
The guy who made that t-shirt from hell.com is going to hell.
Alright, how about a sim update for the week, Loki?
Anything you want to say about the sim world?
Give me a cracker.
Freaking site, not up.
Yeah, let's see.
I know there's more Stepmania updates.
I know they keep doing CVS snapshots or whatever.
So just keep watching those because they keep getting better and better and stuff.
They have a bunch of cool modifiers like I mentioned before, like all the DDR Extreme stuff.
And the Monty Sims, now they have stuff.
The Monty Style just got, they're uploading their media section again because they switched to a dedicated server thanks to everyone's donations.
So they're going to be up pretty soon with all the media and stuff and all the 8-style videos and whatnot.
So they're going to be coming up.
DDRUK is doing some weird thing with, you know, you have to be like some registered member and whatnot to download shit.
You can't even download it anyway.
Not that that matters anyways when my site comes up because I'm just going to have everything and say, whatever, I don't require anything, just download the hell.
But yeah, my site, yeah, it's funny, yeah.
Working on it, really am.
There's a lot of shit I gotta update in order to get this site up.
Mainly I'm working on the sim files, getting them all zipped up, putting in appropriate CD tags with them.
But a lot of the sim files are incomplete, need to be fixed, need to make new backgrounds for them, just fix them up.
And so that's what's taking the longest time right now.
Right now I've got everything done.
I have second style, third style, and I'm almost done with fourth style.
Problem is it's going to get even slower now because the higher up I go, the more sim files I have.
So once those are done, I promise they'll all be up.
It'll probably be like a good 600 files up at the first update.
So it'll be worth it, but it's just going to take a while before that comes up.
And just so you guys know, listening, there will be every week, there will be a nice hidden page for exclusive to the listeners with sim file stuff that will not be on the site.
and maybe I'll give it a month before I update those onto the actual site off the hidden pages.
But those will be exclusive for the listeners of the show.
You'll have exclusive DWIs before everyone else.
So, enjoy.
There's actually a pretty decent Stepmania theme that was posted on stepmania.com.
It's called Forever Blue 2.0 or something.
It's, I would say, a very different take on the themes you're used to.
It's more of like a gothic type theme.
The freeze arrows are like blue and stuff like that.
It's actually a pretty interesting one if you download it just to see it, if anything.
That was done by Healing Vision, one of the best fucking artists out there, and really awesome sim file maker, makes everything just like an official Konami mix, so, yeah.
What's up?
Twin-made announcer packs.
No, actually, Twin, all he did was he ripped the announcers and he ripped up the thing.
In fact, he was actually bitching about, that was one of the things he bitched about me a while back, is he wanted me to send the announcer stuff, whatever.
You know, that's cool that he released the announcers for Solo and shit, even though... Toon Can Lady?
Oh yeah, I have those on my computer.
I could have released them at any point, but you know, I just don't care.
Instead, I'm just going to release them all at once, so it really doesn't matter to me.
He doesn't bother me at all.
Him with his announcer packs in high-quality, high-res banners, because that's all he can rip from the poor DDR disks.
How did he even get them?
It's just the same way I get them.
You just rip them from the arcade disc.
You know someone, you get to this image.
Whoop-de-doo.
So off of his Korean 2-disc.
Well, guess what?
I own an official one!
Not that I care.
Whatever.
Yeah, go ahead.
Release your banners and stuff.
I'll release my site with 2,000 DWIs on it.
My Yahoo win.
You guys can talk offline.
Set that all up.
Okay, one other quick thing I want to talk about before we go off the air tonight is waste of time websites.
Because we were talking about Neopets.com.
Neopets is not a waste of time.
What a fucking waste of time.
What a fucking waste of time.
It's worse than Animal Crossing.
This site is the best website ever.
It's maddox.xmission.com.
It's maddox.xmission.com.
And that's got the crazy guy who rants about different things, and he has some really funny ones on there.
So definitely check those out.
Another one that's funny is one that Vandalist posted in the Sakimani forums.
The one where they had the little Mario-like video that the guy made.
It was called like, Mac Daddy Mario was the topic on Sakimani.
And the guy actually went and made a bunch of little videos and movies using Nintendo characters.
It's actually pretty cool.
They have like one Mario's dancing to like disco music and then Peach comes up to him and they start dancing together.
So it's actually pretty good, if not kind of cheesy.
TheSmokingGun.com It's news, but it's really cool.
And The Onion.
A new one that came up this week, NationStates.net Yes, Dan does that.
Have you made your nation yet?
I haven't yet, but Dan's done his Gunstaria.
Oh, okay.
You know what?
There's a whole... The DDR crew's got this lazy college students.
There's a whole bunch of Amani people getting into this thing.
I'm even on it now.
The Queendom of Batston is up.
That's mine.
Maybe I should do Sac of Amania.
Hey, that would be cool.
You make your own nation and then you decide on issues and you run it.
And you can be like an evil dictatorship or you can be... Loki, it's hella your thing.
It's hella your thing.
You know, I used to do something like that when I was in middle school.
We would create our countries and run it and everything and then we'd have a war.
That was funny, is the way my country, or we did this thing in sociology, like, you know, trying to depict the best way society should be run, and the way it would work the best, and mine ended up turning into, like, oh, I don't know, neo-Nazism.
That's the way mine was, but it worked.
I don't know.
Maybe there's something to it.
I probably have a nice social estate.
Alright, I think we ought to wrap up the show now, because we're running over a little bit.
We're going to do the nation of Pacmania.
That's cool.
And have the currency be the dot.
That's cool.
Can't you make more than one?
And the national animal be the ghost monster.
Oh.
Alright, we're running over a little bit, so, final thoughts.
You dropped pussy all over.
Uh...
Zero, any final thoughts for the day?
Um, not really, just, I don't know, play more GDR and listen to the next shows.
I don't know, I'm dumb right now, don't worry.
Um, all work and no play makes me you.
Jamie?
Shrimp chips own your soul.
They taste like pussy.
Loki?
I've had a headache for 24 hours and so I can't wait till tomorrow.
I almost got some last night.
That close.
Story of my life.
