69636	71498	Why did they have to take the word gay?
72359	75742	Nobody expects us to punish a physician.
76002	76722	It's Kendo.

160919	161799	No, no, it's cool, it's cool.
161819	162940	We're just fucking with you.
165580	166560	I thought she was waving hello.
167200	168281	Was that a hello or goodbye?
168741	169401	I hate English.
174983	175283	You know what?
175303	177363	They're thinking that that might be a dead mic.
177423	177763	Hold on.
177803	179144	We're having some technical difficulties.
179184	180824	Let's try this again real fast.
181144	181864	Here, use my mic.
182625	183125	Not funny.
183225	183765	Bored.
183825	184545	Goddammit.
184985	186026	Show's falling apart already.
186266	189646	Alright, go around and introduce yourself one more time with a mic that works, and I'll figure out what's going on with the other one.

241163	241903	The Revenge.

263179	263359	Bye.
265080	266021	And this time you can hear it.
266481	269162	In this corner, say hello to our tech master, Loki.
269442	275785	Hey everybody, we're going to take episode 34 and we're going to add some CG, call it special edition, and resell it for hundreds of dollars.
276746	277906	You ain't bad, you ain't bad.
277946	279667	I put Jabba the Hutt back in the Sky Wars.
279947	281228	I go to school and I kill people.
281268	282248	I'm rolling games.
282288	282888	What am I?
285009	287670	Also with us tonight, say hello to Zero.
287690	288771	Hey, how's it going?
291172	292773	He's our host in training.
292793	294594	What exactly would you call Zero the sequel?
294834	294954	One?
295134	297035	Or is it zero squared is still zero?
297055	297675	He's a prequel.
298456	299176	Zero one.
299536	301097	Oh, I made up a mommy joke!
301297	301697	Ow.
302158	309141	He can be our host in training.
311402	312062	Or intern.
312082	313723	Does that mean he has to wear diapers?
315204	318626	Hey, you know, Walgreens had some depends on sale half price.
321893	323334	You can just put like heels on my feet.
323514	325895	Then you have a training bra.
325915	326715	Then you have Heelys.
326935	327676	But that's not funny.
328036	328936	How about a training bra?
330517	333638	He'd have to wear it on his head and go around to the screen.
333718	335579	I have a picture of Mel B with panties on his head.
335799	336639	I smell that picture.
337760	340281	I'm sorry, but you just made me think it's an understation joke.
340461	340921	Oh, what's that?
341161	343042	If you wore the bra on his head, he'd be Queen Amidala.
344435	345897	I'm Queen Amidala.
346738	347439	Hi, Travis.
348140	348941	Hi, Travis, if you're listening.
348961	351063	UnderStationLive.org, back up and running, by the way.
351083	355189	They moved, so they have this whole room now, their own studio, so check them out if you haven't yet.
355749	357391	You've got to know your roots.
357531	359314	Jamie and I's roots is UnderStationLive.org.
360995	361415	I burped.
361475	362555	I burped better than that earlier.
362575	363576	That was awesome.
363976	365676	You burped, like, bigger than my dad.
365716	367596	I burped artichoke hearts and vanilla coke.
367636	368937	That was the win.
369117	369717	Anyway, yes.
370877	371637	And mushrooms.
371877	372497	They were sauteed.
372537	373978	We'll be talking to everybody a bit more later.
375078	379859	We'll be talking about Cyber Beat tonight, the big tourney that happened in SoCal for a little bit.
379899	382419	We got some clips from the interviews and stuff.
382439	382979	That'll be fun.
382999	385360	That doesn't feel to be paid out of vinegar.
386562	386842	Yes?
386943	387864	You feel not so fresh.
388125	390429	I have that not so fresh feeling once in a while.
393094	393475	Twit.
393856	395879	Alright, we'll be right back.
396120	398224	Here's some another's for your listening pleasure on Orange Launch Radio.
480003	480887	Thank you for watching!
529029	530411	S, Actdeft, S, Actdeft
561218	562240	Thank you for watching
638717	639899	Thank you for watching!
704161	704792	Thanks for watching!
747102	747982	Chilli Pimps on Netflix
782313	783934	Hi, this is Mel B of RTF.
784274	789157	And for an extra $1.99 a minute, my girlfriend Mel B can join us on all the fun together.
790037	795981	Hey, if you're a broke ass like I am, why don't you come to the one place that costs absolutely nothing to go to and still the fun is just as great.
796301	798202	It's Orange Lounge Radio, Sunday nights.
798782	803185	Kick it with me and you just might realize the best things in life are free.
804205	806747	Yes, indeedly, the best things in life are free.
806767	808748	You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio, which is free.
809799	810760	Um, yeah.
837177	838198	I wouldn't exactly call it excellent.
852951	855172	I mean, I get like 250 messages a day.
855333	856594	Well, dang.
856734	862058	See, I know some people that get so much Yahoo spam, but I hardly get any on my account.
862078	863019	It's all sent to my trash.
863059	864961	But see, the thing is it doesn't empty fast enough.
865001	867343	I have to go in there and empty my trash like six times a day.
867703	871606	Because after like one day, I'll see that there's 75 messages in trash.
872747	873708	There's a bulk folder.
873928	878011	Yeah, 75 messages in trash, 26 in bulk, and like two in my other one.
878111	879673	And two that are actually in my inbox.
880393	881034	Both are spam.
884338	885799	You know, you can block the addresses.
886499	888520	I already have 100 blocked addresses.
888760	889240	Jeez.
889500	890901	I know.
891361	895183	Spammers are so high-tech nowadays that they change their address.
895203	897004	I mean, they're emailing you from a new address each time.
897044	901406	So even if you block it, they just go to, you know, say you're getting spammed from Loki 1.
901726	903246	Then they'll just go to Loki 2 and Loki 3.
903326	905147	Well, what I'm starting to do now is block.
905187	907048	You can block domains on there also.
907468	907988	Block AOL.
908109	908529	Just kidding.
912456	914478	One thing though that people should realize...
936475	943239	If you want a lot of that information we're getting into and don't want telemarketer calls, whenever a telemarketer calls you, tell them to opt you out.
943739	945220	It is a federal privacy law.
945280	946900	I work for a mortgage company now.
946940	948341	I used to work in customer service for one.
948921	949922	Tell them to opt you out.
949982	953964	If you have a mortgage, if you live with people who have a mortgage, tell them to have...
954524	955625	They're a servicer.
955905	959686	Opt you out of all outside communication not to share your information.
960206	966809	Call the three credit bureau reporting... I'm trying to remember what they are off the top of my head.
966849	969550	There's Equifax.
970731	971871	There's one of... not Equifax.
972471	973292	Yeah, Equifax.
973852	975433	There's two others, but I don't remember off the top of my head.
976153	980835	But you can also write your credit bureaus and have them not share your information because that's the primary way they get it.
981095	984997	I was going to say, a lot of people also know it as the don't call list.
985218	987759	If you tell a telemarketer to put you on the don't call list, then they have to.
987939	990101	Otherwise, that's breaking the law.
990761	990981	Yep.
991922	993002	But that right there.
993483	1000247	Since we used to get about two, three telemarketer calls a night sometimes, I called one of them.
1000307	1001147	I said, opt us out.
1001648	1003529	We didn't get a single one for the next month.
1003988	1006350	And for junk mail, if you want it, this is great.
1006810	1010893	Maddox, from his wonderful site, recommended this.
1011173	1027184	When you get those credit card applications in the mail, take your junk mail, stick them in the nice little prepaid envelope given to you by the credit card mailer, and look, you got rid of your junk mail and the stupid credit card company stopped mailing you because you're sending them back junk mail.
1028605	1029666	You can also just write...
1030347	1033488	Three lovely words on top of every last bit of that junk mail.
1034008	1034888	Return to sender.
1036509	1036909	It works.
1038389	1040710	Or deceased.
1040730	1041650	Deceased is great.
1042170	1044811	When you write deceased, you don't get it mailed anymore.
1045511	1047472	I've done that with a couple of them.
1047532	1048052	It works.
1048472	1049833	That's messed up, but funny.
1050833	1051873	Wasn't that an old 80s song?
1051933	1053894	Return to sender, I guess.
1053914	1054314	I don't know.
1054374	1054614	Anyway.
1055214	1056295	There's a big bandaid on it.
1075602	1086327	If you're not being able to get in through your normal means, go ahead and go to our Java page at orangelounge.skie.cx Click on chat and use the Java applet because the server that the Java applet points to works fine.
1086787	1087527	So you can use that.
1088328	1090929	Cool, huh?
1091589	1092469	Jamie brought treats.
1093830	1095291	What kind of treats did you bring tonight, Jamie?
1095311	1096151	Shrimp chips.
1097332	1100933	Because every snack I get has to have some kind of connotation.
1101413	1102834	So I got shrimp chips this time.
1104210	1105251	and Sweet Potato Chips.
1106031	1107652	I don't like shrimp chips.
1107692	1110473	I mean, they're okay, but they just, they're so weird to me.
1110533	1115876	Like, when I eat shrimp, I expect to be eating, like, Long John Silver's Ghetto Deep Fried Shrimp.
1117676	1118517	Mmm, shrimpy.
1119737	1120798	They don't really taste like shrimp.
1121418	1122439	They smell like ass.
1123339	1124300	Or, actually.
1126401	1127661	They smell like rank pussy.
1127801	1128722	That's what it smells like.
1129502	1130082	They're yummy.
1131143	1132063	Damn it, I like pussy.
1132183	1132704	I mean, wait.
1134844	1137285	So how was the drunk show last week?
1137405	1144508	I wasn't here to experience it, unfortunately, but this is something EOSFBB gave me a link to.
1144528	1145288	I'll get to it in a minute.
1145829	1147249	Well, how did things go last week?
1147869	1148610	I was drunk.
1148790	1149470	I haven't listened to it.
1149530	1150530	How drunk did you guys get?
1150751	1151211	Not very.
1151331	1151931	Not me, anyway.
1152611	1153592	Melody was really silly.
1154232	1156033	I just got, like, drunk.
1156133	1157133	Okay, this is what I had.
1158834	1159194	I had...
1160703	1170389	About four things of... Actually, I drank out of this flask of... What was that Dutch chocolate liqueur that Melody brought?
1170609	1171609	Kahlua?
1171669	1173350	No, it's Dutch chocolate.
1174031	1174971	Really good chocolate liqueur.
1175992	1180194	I had a few swallows of that out of the flask.
1180214	1183236	You were drinking straight out of the bottle.
1183356	1187878	I made this drink with vanilla soy milk and Godiva liqueur.
1189019	1190260	No, this one brand of soy milk.
1190600	1191260	I'm making a face.
1191721	1193802	This one brand of soy milk, you can't even tell it's soy milk.
1193862	1195103	It's very creamy like real milk.
1196363	1196944	Mmm, creamy.
1197364	1197684	Oh yeah.
1197764	1198925	I do, I do, I do.
1199605	1200926	Um, yeah, whatever.
1202647	1206349	Um, but it was, I had like four of those or something.
1206870	1210011	And then, um, I had, um, a shot of vodka.
1210572	1211292	No, it wasn't vodka.
1211312	1211893	I had a shot of rum.
1213293	1218977	I had, um, three of those, um,
1222394	1225376	The Smirnoff Ice Triple Blacks Oh, those are so good.
1226617	1229738	Did anyone get super crazy or naked or super... No.
1230238	1233320	Everybody went... Ross brought a 40 of St.
1233460	1233660	Ives.
1234461	1236822	No, but the show went south when I brought my video over.
1237742	1240764	Yeah, everyone went downstairs to watch this video right here.
1240784	1241825	The Ron Jeremy porn star video.
1241845	1243325	Which I bought so we could watch it after the show.
1243345	1243405	Yay!
1243906	1246307	Yeah, I want to see it.
1246327	1246727	I heard about it.
1246747	1248008	Ron Jeremy can kiss his own penis.
1248668	1249589	How exciting.
1250373	1252795	I always have wanted to see a man kiss his own penis.
1254075	1254756	Not really.
1256297	1256817	Not you.
1258879	1265523	I just did this little jerk motion that made me look like I was about to do it and Jamie got scared.
1266463	1267924	What are these, sweet potato chips?
1268004	1268825	Uh-huh, they're yummy.
1269045	1269826	Let's read the back.
1269986	1275729	Sweet potato chips is made with sweet potato and made at Golden Crunch, containing no preservatives and no cholesterol.
1276130	1277891	It's an ideal snack for all ages.
1278527	1279187	Eat some!
1279888	1280308	Eat it!
1280648	1281108	Eat it!
1285431	1285671	Well?
1286631	1287152	Yeah, they're okay.
1287292	1288392	They're no Pringles, but they're good.
1289173	1289773	This is better.
1289793	1292414	They may not have sweet potatoes, and they're yummy.
1292634	1293655	What happened with Match Game?
1293755	1295216	People in the chatroom were talking about Match Game.
1295596	1296837	We kept talking about Ron Jeremy.
1297577	1298237	Jesus.
1299718	1301119	I didn't save it, unfortunately.
1301379	1302920	Oh, speaking of kissing penis...
1304911	1311656	EOSFEB wanted me to share this article with you all Mr. Spanky, Mr. Spanky Oh, you want Mr. Spanky to do it?
1312536	1329988	Alright, we'll get Mr. Spanky in here Hold on, we gotta call Mr. Spanky Jamie, call Mr. Spanky Mr. Spanky Then why don't you call Mr. Spanky?
1331850	1332570	What the fuck?
1333571	1333711	No
1336306	1337587	Paging Mr. Spanky.
1338127	1340829	Mr. Spanky, you have a call at the front desk.
1342109	1343310	We have a winner!
1346992	1349213	Mr. Spanky would now like to read you this article.
1350674	1353516	It's called, Teens Asked to Consider Oral Sex.
1354958	1365323	In London, school children under 16 are being encouraged to experiment with oral sex as part of a government-backed drive to cut Britain's sky-high teenage pregnancy rate.
1365823	1374467	The Times said the scheme, pioneered by a university and backed by the Department of Health and Education, trains teachers to discuss pre-sex stopping points.
1376968	1384973	The idea is to reduce promiscuity by encouraging pupils to discover levels of intimacy, including oral sex, instead of full sexual intercourse.
1385594	1390617	But family campaigners condemn the accord, saying it would only encourage children to experiment with sex.
1395365	1403088	The director of the Family Education Trust told the newspaper, I don't think that anyone believes that teaching people about oral sex will stop them from having full sex.
1403548	1405389	It's more likely to make them want to try it.
1405449	1408130	It doesn't protect them against sexually transmitted diseases.
1409991	1411251	Tell us about that, Mr. Spanky.
1411271	1412952	Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
1413432	1414252	Blah, blah, blah.
1414372	1417493	Oh, Britain has the highest teenage pregnancy rate in Western Europe.
1417533	1419794	The government has a set target of halving levels by 2010.
1421315	1421735	Bye!
1422115	1423316	Tell us about the diseases.
1423816	1423916	No.
1427822	1428423	I put a spell on you!
1447202	1450623	I wanted to read some of the Yahoo Talkbacks here.
1450783	1453945	There's nothing better on Yahoo News than Yahoo Talkbacks.
1454325	1455085	You gonna go get some juice?
1456466	1456826	Let's see.
1457006	1459167	Oh, we have God is the answer.
1461414	1462475	I think that it's terrible.
1462535	1464076	They should teach them about God.
1464416	1465497	They should focus.
1465617	1466778	The should focus.
1467238	1468719	This guy's got a great education here.
1469139	1470981	The should focus in what the Bible says.
1471061	1472722	Want to give a good advice.
1472882	1473783	Get it from the Bible.
1474203	1475144	That sounds like English.
1478446	1480207	I'm sorry, what did you say?
1480768	1481948	He was educated in Britain.
1483289	1484350	God is the answer.
1484690	1485251	Let's see.
1485331	1486892	Let's look at re-God is the answer.
1486912	1489634	We could have been saying dog is the answer, but we wouldn't know.
1491192	1492773	Let's see, God is the answer.
1496276	1497717	None of these replies are any good.
1499038	1501520	I also think it's terrible that they should teach them about God.
1501720	1503361	Religion and school doesn't mix.
1503782	1506303	But sex ed is a real issue, not some religious one.
1507104	1508005	Let's see what else is there.
1508065	1508705	Oh, this is good.
1510407	1512428	This person says, teach hygiene first.
1513029	1518673	Washing of antiseptic solution like betadine or chlorhexidine to keep it clean and fresh at all times.
1521224	1523125	or, you know, oh, never mind, Jamie's not in the room right now.
1524006	1527348	Oh, here's one, GreatStuff98 says, why not anal?
1527928	1529830	I thought they were also pushing that for a bit.
1530210	1532792	Really weird, kids need to be kids and forget about the sex thing.
1536194	1538615	Let's see, one more, one more, let's see.
1539416	1541477	Let's see, they should teach good hand jobs.
1542798	1544259	Lucky be the man who's skilled at hand.
1544359	1545019	Alright, alright, alright.
1545840	1548362	Thank you for bringing this show down to a whole new level, ESVB.
1552870	1553970	I'm sorry I had to burp there.
1555991	1558752	It's weird being gone for like a week and having to come back.
1558812	1560792	It's like I feel like I haven't done this for like a whole month.
1562073	1562473	Yeah.
1563113	1564953	Anything else of interest happen last week, Loki?
1566154	1566514	No.
1568054	1568434	Okay.
1569975	1570155	No.
1570515	1571515	I don't know.
1572095	1574316	I want more metal pads off the eBay.
1574336	1574456	Okay.
1575504	1576045	Oh, you know what?
1576125	1579868	I'm going to be giving away... I'm going to get these.
1579908	1581810	My friend Matt is going to give them to me for free.
1581830	1583952	My other friend Matt is going to give them to me for free.
1584232	1585873	And I think we might do some kind of giveaway.
1586014	1587995	It's going to have to be a more local giveaway.
1588196	1589597	They're wannabe ignition pads.
1590117	1592379	They're not ignition pads, but they're the knockoff wannabe kind.
1592880	1595702	And I don't really have a use for them, so I think we're going to do some kind of giveaway.
1595742	1598625	I just don't know how yet, because I can't afford to ship them to anybody.
1599085	1601187	So they're going to have to be some kind of local giveaway.
1601267	1601668	I don't know.
1602819	1605581	We should, like, just hook them up and see how badly we can thrash them.
1606902	1608423	Oh, you just want to beat them up on air?
1610044	1612826	We could dissect a wannabe ignition pad live on air.
1612846	1613406	That would be fun.
1613546	1614507	No, that's stupid.
1614547	1615188	I've done it before.
1617469	1620611	Well, we could set it on fire, except we have no place to set it on fire at.
1622312	1622973	Okay, here.
1623033	1623653	That smells good.
1623713	1624214	What is that?
1624774	1625775	It looks like blood.
1626916	1627676	It looks like blood.
1628417	1629497	Jamie brought blood back here.
1629517	1629898	That's, uh...
1631847	1632948	Cranberry Grape?
1638350	1638630	Anyway.
1638950	1641451	It's Cranberry Apple Martinellis.
1642051	1643112	You know Giant Matt, right?
1643792	1644032	Yeah.
1644092	1646493	Giant Matt's giving me two wannabe ignition pads.
1646533	1648394	They're not ignition pads, they're the wannabe ones.
1648894	1649915	Some third party ignition pads.
1650855	1652436	I don't know, I was thinking we could do some kind of giveaway.
1652456	1652756	Give it to me.
1653676	1654817	You just want me to give them to you?
1654837	1655277	Yeah.
1655397	1656418	Well, I wanted to do a giveaway.
1656498	1657118	I want to borrow it.
1657918	1660080	Why don't I give you one and then we can give the other one away?
1660420	1660620	Okay.
1660920	1661141	Okay.
1661981	1665364	But we can't afford for shipping, although some people are saying they'll pay for shipping.
1665404	1667085	Well, we'll think of some kind of contest.
1667346	1667946	Maybe we can do something.
1667966	1669968	How about the DWI contest?
1671509	1672990	Ah, okay.
1673611	1676513	Okay, so that's going to be part of the prize for the DWI contest.
1676573	1677654	I like what you think.
1678034	1679055	I like the way this woman thinks.
1679675	1680616	That's because I think.
1680896	1681217	All right.
1681657	1682638	I think, therefore I am.
1685180	1691104	We're all going to be at, I was thinking we could do some kind of giveaway at B3, some kind of random door prize or something, I don't know though how that's all going to work.
1691164	1698209	B3 details are still being formed, although that is happening in May, May something through 17th, I don't know what it is, sometime in May.
1698229	1698869	I have an announcement.
1699610	1700430	You have an announcement?
1700890	1701211	Woohoo!
1701351	1703032	Announcements, announcements, alright, give your announcement.
1703192	1711037	We have a date set on the date of March 29th and March 30th, a tournament more usually held in the Bay Area.
1711738	1713759	It's going to be held at Scandia in Sacramento.
1714830	1715531	March Madness!
1716192	1717454	Yay!
1718355	1724143	We'll have details up on that, and by next week we should be able to give people links to where the rules are and all that information.
1724904	1729410	But be prepared, this one is not going to be just perfect attack.
1729550	1732093	This one's also going to be freestyle, and freestyle will be rather...
1733214	1735095	Can you tell us more about that at this time?
1736056	1737437	Even if I could, I wouldn't.
1737497	1737877	Not yet.
1738037	1741619	I've heard the proposition that they're doing for Freestyle.
1742319	1744200	It is going to kick so much ass.
1744220	1749443	This is really funny because on the drive down to SoCal, we were talking about the exact same thing.
1749463	1752225	And I said, I want to see that happen in Sacramento.
1752805	1754306	And lo and behold, it's going to.
1754966	1755326	Awesome.
1756007	1759468	So once again, March Madness, March 29th and 30th.
1760749	1761449	Sacramento, Scandia.
1761629	1762690	Sacramento, Scandia.
1762790	1764310	Be here or die.
1764350	1765090	Or we'll kick your ass.
1766491	1766891	That's it.
1767111	1767311	Ding.
1767911	1769172	More details forthcoming.
1769212	1773793	Keep your eyes on... I don't know if we'll get to be affiliated to that.
1773833	1775613	I can't say, oh, Sacramento sucks.
1776414	1777014	Do you know what I do?
1777314	1780235	I was just told that on Friday.
1782355	1785136	You were told that by someone whose opinion doesn't count.
1785696	1785957	Oh, yes.
1787197	1787437	Anyway.
1789131	1791513	You're already getting offers in the chat room to help with the tournament.
1791533	1793314	Stay tuned to DDR Freak.
1793334	1794174	We'll have a thread on it.
1794194	1795996	Sackbimani will have a thread on it for sure.
1796196	1796956	I will go ahead and say this.
1796976	1801379	There will be a meeting at my house for people who are in the area or can make it to the area.
1802740	1809104	Just send me a private message on Sackbimani.com to DarkSakura and I'll take any offers of assistance I can.
1809785	1809985	Yes.
1810874	1813096	Hopefully I'll be participating in that too.
1814437	1815298	Well, I can't say it.
1815538	1818081	I can't say it until more details come out.
1818101	1819182	How about you say the voice?
1819242	1819622	The voice.
1820543	1820803	Okay.
1820903	1824727	When more details come out, we'll be a little... We won't be so dodgy.
1825727	1826648	But you heard it here first.
1826969	1827449	Yes, you did.
1827549	1828550	Or second or third, I don't know.
1828870	1829191	First!
1829571	1834415	Anyway, speaking of tournaments, let's get to the CyberBeat tape, shall we?
1834555	1836157	Let's hear some of the CyberBeat stuff.
1836177	1836357	Okay.
1837593	1840795	Oh God, we're just going to hear, what we're going to do is we're going to play some clips.
1840815	1847180	We're not going to play because there's literally probably about an hour and a half of tape from the Cyber Beat trip, from the LA trip.
1847500	1849261	However, a lot of it is very random.
1849701	1854204	I swear to God, Wendell went off for 20 minutes telling us a story about Mike Ngo, which is really funny.
1854905	1856866	But, you know, we just don't have the time to do that on this show right now.
1856886	1858067	But you'll have to tune in to hear that.
1858087	1860429	That's right, so if you want to hear that, you've got to tune in.
1861369	1871581	on Tuesday at 7 o'clock Pacific Time or Saturday at 4 o'clock Pacific Time.
1871621	1874624	Those are the two times we're going to be airing the Cyber Beat full tapes.
1874964	1880050	But in the meantime, we're going to play some clips for you because these are interviews that we did with some folks.
1882074	1885757	And the first set is going to be an excerpt from Saturday.
1886138	1891002	This is the day that PA wrapped up, so we're going to hear from the winner of Perfect Attack.
1891903	1896006	And we're going to hear some stuff starting off in the hotel room before we left.
1896467	1900430	We have another quick interview of somebody that came to visit us in our hotel room before we go.
1900831	1903193	So we're going to go to those tapes and we'll be right back.
1903713	1906195	Well, actually we'll be here because we might want to comment on how this is going.
1906335	1907576	So, here we go.
1908925	1910386	Wait, actually, wait, I don't think they're on yet.
1910406	1912788	Hold on, I gotta turn on the mixer.
1913628	1914769	I know what I'm doing.
1915490	1916210	You know what?
1917211	1918772	Alright, here we go, let's see.
1919712	1921153	I want to talk to you really fast so I have a chance.
1921193	1924115	Since we don't talk to new people on the show very often, I'll just put them on the spot.
1924135	1925857	I want to say hi to Tequila.
1926497	1926837	What's up?
1927338	1927678	What's up?
1928234	1928734	How are you doing?
1928754	1929514	Where are you from, Tequila?
1929734	1931035	I'm from Omaha, and how are you?
1931415	1931915	I'm pretty good.
1931935	1934036	So you came all the way out here from Omaha to do this tournament?
1934316	1934896	Yes, sir, I did.
1935136	1936637	What enticed you to get on that plane?
1936757	1939077	What was the factor that said, I've got to be at this tournament?
1940158	1941498	First prize.
1941558	1942399	Max 2 machine.
1942419	1943479	That's a lot of money.
1944159	1949501	So, you know, without giving too much away, what kind of secrets you got in your freestyle routine that's going to make you walk home with that machine?
1950881	1952182	Two props for my first routine.
1953002	1954442	Two sexy props.
1954883	1956163	Most scandalous routine ever.
1957165	1957625	Yes, Jamie?
1957806	1958226	One word.
1958786	1960108	Shades.
1962750	1963491	Big shades.
1965632	1967234	What have you, baby?
1967834	1968915	Definitely looking forward to seeing it.
1968995	1970497	Anything else you want to say to folks out there?
1970517	1972258	Anything about the tournament or what have you?
1972719	1974080	The videos will speak for themselves.
1976761	1978582	Let the videos speak for themselves.
1979263	1980204	More to come later.
1980424	1982525	I think we're going to have to interview you after that routine.
1983306	1983927	That's perfect.
1984067	1984907	All right, perfect.
1985588	1987249	Come find me because I'm a lazy bastard.
1987269	1988430	I don't tape much for the show.
1988530	1989531	I swear to God I will.
1989811	1990452	All right, great.
1990832	1995356	Videos won't truly get the whole feel of it.
1995656	1996457	I came to L.A.
1996477	1997077	just for this.
1998919	2000460	RTF domination, baby.
2001875	2002556	We shall see.
2031897	2035738	It was pretty hard, I guess.
2035758	2036119	Tiring?
2036359	2036919	Yeah, tiring.
2037839	2038279	I don't know.
2039300	2041020	The last match was kind of weird.
2041261	2042721	How many songs did you have to play in that last match?
2043021	2043801	I don't know, I was keeping count.
2044702	2045502	What was the toughest one?
2045542	2046362	What was the toughest one for you?
2047283	2050584	It must have been Paranoia, because I think that's the song I really messed up on.
2050764	2051384	Paranoia, Survivor.
2051604	2053125	Or, Survivor, Eternal.
2053849	2055970	So, did you train for this at all?
2056110	2057831	Like, did you practice a lot?
2057951	2060132	How do you do to prepare yourself for something like this?
2060172	2063033	You know, I went to MGL every day, you know, for like two weeks.
2063413	2065274	You know, something like that, yeah.
2065354	2070177	You're pretty well known in NorCal, at least, for being the PA guy that seems to walk away on the first prize for all the tournaments.
2070197	2073998	So, did you do anything extra for this, being like it was going to be a big tournament?
2074118	2076199	What do you mean, like, do anything?
2076379	2077760	Was there any, like, extra preparation?
2077780	2082082	Like, was it extra... Were you extra nervous for this one, or... Oh, yeah, I was...
2083163	2084864	Was it just another day for Jigger?
2084904	2085824	No, it wasn't another day.
2085904	2086425	I don't know.
2086445	2087065	I was getting kind of worried.
2087085	2089066	I saw really good PAs and stuff.
2090387	2093049	That whole training every day thing, that was like, whoa, it's crazy.
2093549	2095150	Any future tournaments you plan on attending?
2096231	2098172	I don't know of any coming up.
2098232	2099012	Except for one in Seattle.
2099052	2100473	I think my dad's taking me or something.
2101154	2102714	Now, I know your dad comes with you to all the tournaments.
2102734	2103775	That's pretty cool.
2103795	2104435	A lot of support.
2104455	2106337	Do you get a lot of support from your parents?
2106477	2106697	Yeah.
2107116	2107496	Yeah.
2107957	2110198	That's good.
2110599	2112540	They don't stand there and punish you if you do bad, do you?
2112560	2113921	No, no, no, no, no.
2114341	2115022	I'm just joking around.
2115042	2115823	Of course not, of course not.
2115843	2117684	But that's awesome that they show up and there's work.
2117884	2119746	Do you ever watch the tapes?
2121046	2121467	What tapes?
2121827	2122948	Because I know I see tapes sometimes.
2122988	2123268	I don't know.
2123648	2124209	Oh, yeah, yeah.
2124449	2126991	And it's cool because people actually ask me for copies and stuff sometimes.
2127351	2128452	Because nobody ever tapes PA.
2128472	2129313	It's like PA ain't important.
2129333	2130193	Nobody wants to tape that stuff.
2130233	2131054	But your dad does.
2131114	2131454	That's cool.
2132775	2133596	Yeah.
2133656	2134757	PA is not important?
2134777	2135077	Yeah.
2135421	2136201	What you mean by that, man?
2137202	2140483	No, I mean, but you know, like, if you get on the internet, there's all the freestyle videos, there's no PA videos.
2140743	2143124	Hey, I'm a PA-er myself, except I was too lazy for this one.
2143384	2143644	Yeah.
2145105	2145925	Yeah.
2146766	2148286	So anything else you want to say about the tournament?
2148706	2149427	Thoughts for the day?
2149447	2153108	I don't know, it was cool, because, like, the Markov people were, like, keeping me motivated.
2153328	2157410	Like, my girlfriend, and, like, um... Wendell, yeah, Wendell.
2157470	2157830	Wendell.
2158650	2159791	And, um, Mike, no...
2160692	2161953	and, yeah, just a number of people.
2162314	2163134	Good people in DDR.
2163154	2163335	Yeah.
2163555	2165336	Well, congratulations once again.
2165417	2165777	Good job.
2165797	2166878	What are you going to do with the controller?
2168299	2169000	Um, use it.
2169400	2170201	Where are you going to sell it?
2170241	2170741	Good answer.
2170761	2172823	You're not going to sell it?
2173604	2174205	Uh, I don't know.
2174385	2174825	Maybe.
2174945	2176226	I heard different stories about the controller, too.
2176727	2180170	Like, it's worth $400, and then I heard it was worth $800, then $400 again.
2180330	2182292	They're pretty hard to get a hold of now, so good luck.
2183385	2183565	BOO NER
2206280	2206861	Like I5?
2229154	2229634	I-5, alright?
2229674	2230775	The cops on I-5.
2230875	2232096	It's internet radio, you can say whatever you want.
2232256	2233156	Fuck the cops, alright?
2233176	2236779	Because, man, I swear to God, if they do that shit again, I just will bust their asses, man.
2236859	2237179	What happened?
2237199	2237699	You got pulled over?
2237859	2239600	Oh my God, dude, we're fucking driving, right?
2239660	2241181	Everyone else is going the same speed and shit.
2241222	2242342	And what does this fucking cop do?
2243423	2244884	You know you're going too fast?
2245024	2246205	What about your family?
2246285	2247005	Bitch, we're friends.
2247245	2248206	We know what the fuck we're doing.
2248626	2249707	So it's like, fuck you, cops.
2249887	2251148	Fuck you, Highway Patrol.
2251428	2251868	You hear that?
2251889	2255311	You give me one more motherfucking ticket, and I'm gonna go like Jahi on your asses, alright?
2255891	2258654	It's the nephew of the week, straight from Bob Lombardi, how about that?
2260015	2265440	So, I notice a lot of freestyles around here, they're kind of nervous, competition's a little tight, what are your thoughts going into freestyle?
2265580	2273728	You know what, when I first came down here, I didn't give a fuck about freestyle, you know, because I figured I would just go up there, you know, improv something like I usually do, you know?
2274975	2288776	But then I started talking, you know, like, I mean, people like Wendell, you know, like Hypnotix, or Go, excuse me, you know, people like Bruce Leroy, Mel B, you know, and it's like, you know, they're taking it hella seriously and stuff, and it's like...
2289369	2290090	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2311585	2314126	Well, you can't put it on a job application, okay?
2314366	2317166	Man, I was number one, you know, at this Southern California tournament.
2317526	2318626	People were cleasing my toes.
2318646	2319366	They'd be like, so?
2319727	2321947	Maybe if you're auditioning for Broadway, like Chicago.
2322247	2322927	Yeah, there you go.
2322987	2323787	That is a good point.
2323827	2324968	That is a very good point.
2325188	2327828	However, you know, I'm, once again, I'm going to go up there.
2328028	2328868	I'm going to do my thing.
2329348	2331169	You know, if I make it to tomorrow, that's excellent.
2331229	2334809	If I don't, I still came down here to kick with my friends, you know, represent North Carolina to the fullest.
2334949	2335930	Awesome attitude to have.
2336650	2338390	Everybody should be like Bob Lombardi, ladies and gentlemen.
2339603	2340663	Everybody!
2341504	2342784	Arirarira!
2343724	2346085	Yay!
2346966	2349446	Any other thoughts you have for the folks at home listening?
2350647	2354788	If you see a police officer drive by after he passes you, flip his ass off.
2355889	2356629	Fuck the police!
2357929	2358810	Oh, can we get a little rap?
2361871	2362131	Alright.
2362911	2365032	So, Mel's back over here too.
2365052	2365972	What do you think about PA, Mel?
2367430	2370012	It was, well... He intends!
2370372	2371473	That's Wendell's catchphrase.
2371693	2373935	Hey, sure beats sticking around, but I digress.
2374415	2379299	PA, man, it's... I mean, I can't honestly say that I was surprised.
2379399	2384282	I mean, I pretty much... It was Tigger, and it was pretty much his tourney to lose.
2384763	2389666	But, you know, it's like, I mean, people did show up, and, like, the thing between JSP, though, it was, like, endless love.
2389987	2391748	I mean, it was like if frickin'...
2392509	2397291	If Stevie Wonder and, like, someone else blind had to play tennis, it was like endless love, man.
2397311	2398572	It was like back and forth, back and forth.
2398852	2402773	Nothing was happening, then this guy slammed the door like a closer, and props to him, man.
2403133	2404254	I mean, it's kind of funny that...
2405552	2408674	Mel, by the way, did a whole bag of crack for this interview.
2408774	2409535	No, I'm just kidding.
2410616	2412757	I'm trying to think of where this reference leads to.
2413398	2415519	I was following it that day.
2415559	2422144	There must have been something in the smog because I was totally following him that day and right now I'm listening to this going, I have no idea what you're talking about, Mel.
2422904	2423545	Well, that's okay.
2423985	2424786	He forgives me, I hope.
2425186	2432016	He went to turn and he don't play a damn game of 2DX, but I'm sure someone on eBay or someone else is gonna make his pockets a little fatter, so props to him.
2432436	2432817	Props to him.
2433097	2437403	So now you're gonna tell us any, like, surprises we can look forward to your routine, like digging your mouth?
2439246	2439947	Oh, damn.
2439967	2440628	Um, well...
2441417	2442618	I don't know about surprises.
2442838	2445040	I mean, it's just, there'll be new moves, that's for sure.
2445340	2451506	New moves I don't thought, I mean, people think they saw my Let's Talk It Over from Miggle 2, but this one's going to be a complete 180 remix.
2451526	2452787	It's going to look pretty tight.
2453347	2457711	I'm just thinking, yeah, it's going to be enough to be a pretty high qualifier.
2457931	2460133	Then tomorrow, like I said, it's Overdrive.
2461306	2462788	Did anyone whip out their cock?
2481845	2493894	The thing about CyberZone, the arcade where it was hosted, they have in the back karaoke booths where you can go and you sit in and sing karaoke songs for like 50 cents and it grades you on a scale of 0 to 100.
2494655	2499258	Irene and I probably sat in there like all day Saturday and played that game, so we missed.
2500720	2501420	Thanks for watching!
2517699	2521301	I saw the picture, by the way, the karaoke machine, and the text on that one.
2521341	2522462	They brought one of those out.
2523542	2524703	They had, like, the portable one.
2525343	2535369	They brought one of those out at our meeting for Thanksgiving, our Thanksgiving dinner, and it grades you, like, a percentage based on how accurate you are with the music.
2535489	2536370	I want one of those.
2536890	2537350	Buy me.
2538791	2539051	Okay.
2539511	2540212	Look on eBay.
2541300	2543081	Evil Bay Didn't you just buy something big on eBay recently?
2559289	2566952	Yeah, I bought two, well, they're Cypher Games, they're metal pads.
2567412	2569393	They normally would go for $200 a piece.
2569513	2570434	I bought two for $187.
2570474	2573235	Hmm, brand new.
2574195	2576276	I guess they were expecting it to go higher.
2577156	2585380	Also, personal message, I'm sure he's not listening, but to the person that goes by the name, aloha to you too, I beat your ass by $2.30.
2585460	2585740	So there.
2589401	2594123	The little fucker wanted to come and upbid me and thought, oh, I'm going to get the pads at the last minute.
2594143	2597924	Well, I came in 30 seconds to close and threw up the bid of about another $2.
2597964	2601385	You don't want to know about my eBay exploits.
2601805	2602125	What'd you do?
2602145	2602885	It's not every bid I do.
2602905	2606586	If something that I didn't know was going to go for about $15, $20, 10 seconds before it's over, I bid $50.
2611107	2613628	I ended up getting this doujinshi for $30.
2613768	2615409	It was worth it.
2615449	2616750	It was a nice 70 page.
2617290	2617770	Really nice.
2617910	2619091	I bid $150 on it.
2621172	2622473	Because I knew nobody would top it.
2623673	2627535	See, the thing is when people do stuff like that to me, I know how much it's worth.
2627976	2629637	I'll bid up to about how much it's worth.
2630117	2634919	So I'll knock up the bid another $100 on something that's not worth that much.
2637641	2637881	Right on.
2638564	2640225	Fuck the police!
2640245	2641025	Yes, do you feel not so fresh?
2666425	2667707	Do you need to be one with the questions?
2667727	2671611	Apparently, I constantly always have that not-so-fresh feeling, and I never knew why.
2672292	2672873	Now you do.
2672953	2673574	Now I do.
2673594	2675236	Now you know, and knowing is half the battle.
2675256	2676557	Thanks to my guardian angel.
2679821	2681483	I still think that's so funny.
2681763	2682324	It is funny.
2682644	2683826	All right, we'll be back.
2768727	2769070	and so on.
2842685	2843409	Thanks for watching!
2904865	2905837	Thanks for watching!
3009517	3010757	Orange Lounge Radio.
3011098	3013238	We put your thing down, flip it and reverse it.
3017539	3022601	I guess you heard that in Target the other day or something, Jamie?
3022701	3024761	Yes, and I hate that type of music.
3024801	3025722	I don't consider that music.
3027262	3027862	You know what's funny?
3027882	3029163	They were playing that at the club last night.
3029183	3034665	I went out to the club, get my dance on, and they played like this whole set of like booty, like new wave booty.
3034725	3037085	Not the old stuff like you like, but the new wave booty music.
3037105	3043167	Like Lil' Kim, that song, and then that song that goes, my lips, my back, my pussy, and my track.
3043868	3047189	No, when Johnny was over, he found that song and played it for us.
3047809	3049590	And we were like going, turn that off.
3049650	3050610	Melody made him turn it off.
3052389	3053050	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3069093	3069834	Anyway, yeah, hi.
3070494	3071915	You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
3071935	3075958	We occasionally talk about Bomani on this show when there's nothing better to talk about.
3076678	3077338	Oh, yes, Zero.
3077398	3081221	I heard two little, like, 12-year-old girls singing that song on the bus today.
3082021	3083082	I'm not even joking.
3083102	3084903	They're standing there on the bus doing it.
3084943	3087605	I'm like, they know this by heart.
3087625	3090127	They must have listened to it like 100 times just before they got on the bus.
3090227	3092208	It was sad and scary all at the same time.
3092448	3093869	You know what it was when I was a kid?
3093929	3095330	Remember, you too can prevent skanks.
3095370	3095830	Skanks.
3097211	3112439	You know what, I think I might actually have this, but... You know, when I was young, it was all about this, like, this was the song that really pissed my parents off.
3112499	3113940	This song really pissed my parents off.
3116221	3117361	I don't know if you guys know this song.
3121683	3122544	I have to find the part of it.
3131724	3135827	Do you realize that people are still having sex?
3135867	3137529	They've been told not to.
3137729	3139750	Perhaps they are perplexed.
3139770	3143894	When you see them, they're making future plans to engage.
3144394	3152801	Speaking of bad remixes, I downloaded Slim Shady and the background music was Billie Jean.
3154368	3155409	I got a really bad one.
3155429	3156809	No, this is fucking horrible.
3157069	3157550	Listen to this.
3157870	3158950	I just downloaded this the other day.
3158990	3160971	This is the most fucking horrible thing I've ever heard in my life.
3160991	3161592	I'll bring it next week.
3161772	3162012	Okay.
3162032	3166494	We're going to have to have like a, some kind of, maybe like a pre-show or sometime on the station we have to play.
3166534	3167494	Worst remix ever.
3167534	3169495	Really, really bad remixes.
3169515	3173137	Nothing beats the Splat Attack William Shatner Techno Mixes.
3173417	3175918	Those are the most god-awful things you'll ever hear.
3176298	3178479	The music's bad and the samples are worse.
3179200	3179880	It's just awful.
3180532	3180932	Listen to this.
3180952	3183214	You might recognize this song from 2DX6 style.
3183274	3184695	Listen to how they rape this song.
3206011	3207732	They're two different fucking keys!
3209133	3209514	Okay?
3211204	3214605	That was torture because, okay, I have a perfect sense of pitch.
3215446	3216006	I'm a man.
3216626	3218987	I used to elbow people when their horns were out of tune.
3219007	3220367	Go, okay, you're out of tune.
3221848	3226389	And that, the dissonance in that was enough to make heads explode like in scanners.
3227650	3227890	Okay?
3229252	3232035	The very first thing the chatroom goes, is that a twin mix?
3233576	3234317	Chatroom, I love you.
3235078	3239902	Okay, I mean, like, who decided to mix Vincent Damore and Whitney Houston?
3239942	3240723	That's what I want to know.
3241183	3245047	Like, the worst thing I heard lately was that Max 300 jump.
3245227	3248590	I don't know who did it, but it's like, it's the 7 jump with Max 300.
3249571	3251613	They just laid them on top of each other and played them at the same time.
3251806	3268021	The worst one is this Mario, what was it, Mario Max, and, and, and, and, I, I keep, you know, people are like, people, I swear to God, there's people doing talkbacks, and like, they say, so why can't there, anyone make any good remixes of Max 300, like Mario Max, and, and then someone, Mar, what?
3270003	3276429	It's awful, awful shit, don't mix anything from 4th Mix with Max 300, it's just wrong.
3276889	3278511	No, it was just horrible anyway.
3278751	3283976	It's like, they'd cut, they'd stop Max, play some Mario, cut Mario, play some Max.
3289681	3289801	Ew.
3291162	3294686	No, first of all, Whitney Houston needs to have her larynx pulled out.
3295538	3297119	so that we never have to hear from her again.
3297400	3298481	And tell her to stop acting.
3298501	3299341	I hated that fucking movie.
3299361	3300202	My girlfriend made me watch it last night.
3300222	3300602	Freaking Bodyguard.
3300622	3301383	The whole movie was about her bitching.
3301403	3324422	Bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch
3325089	3331736	But no, and you know, Whitney Houston takes this credit for I Will Always Love You, that song.
3332096	3332957	She fucked up that song.
3333077	3334158	Fuck you, Whitney Houston.
3334178	3335519	That is all about Dolly Parton.
3335740	3337361	Shit, Dolly Parton cried during that.
3337421	3339223	Dolly Parton cries in the middle of it.
3339643	3340144	I agree.
3340764	3342126	There is no other version of that song.
3342146	3342947	Whitney Houston needs to die.
3342987	3343387	Bobby Brown.
3343387	3343967	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3368453	3369294	It's South Sacramento.
3370454	3372255	Two good versions of I Will Always Love You.
3372876	3376718	Dolly Parton version and the version the girl belts out in the window in Hedwig.
3377058	3377479	That's it.
3377979	3379380	Yes, that is the best.
3381021	3382602	The one done with the thick country accent.
3382782	3385884	That was one of the highlights of my LA trip, by the way, was getting to see Hedwig on stage.
3386044	3387005	We're taking you next time.
3387645	3388426	Irene and I want to go back.
3388446	3389306	Why isn't Irene here tonight?
3389326	3390127	She promised me she'd be here.
3390667	3391908	Irene, if you're listening, you suck.
3393129	3393889	Gum hella sucks.
3395210	3396791	Hey, we have shrimp chips and you're missing out.
3397318	3400679	Yeah, I have that CD that Brad wanted with all the Death Race songs on it.
3404760	3405200	Death Race?
3405920	3406341	Oh, Death Race.
3406441	3406681	Anyway.
3407201	3407421	Hi.
3409381	3412102	Okay, now that we've talked about horrible remixes, you want to get to the FUs of the Week?
3412702	3412982	Yeah.
3413302	3413683	Alright.
3415043	3423405	Since we might have some new people listening in tonight, because we have the cyberbeat stuff, some people wanting to tune in to hear that, tell the folks what the FUs of the Week are all about.
3423945	3425946	We pick stuff that we hate and bitch about it.
3427719	3428359	That's about it.
3428499	3429099	This is fucked up!
3429159	3429579	I love that thing.
3429659	3433940	Um, my threshold today goes toward, um... Well, okay, last night, it was, uh, me and Tina and her sister-in-law.
3434081	3438962	We're all coming back from, uh, the Rocky cast meeting.
3439042	3442502	And we were gonna, um, we went to an interview, we were gonna...
3454940	3458143	Now that was a surprise to me, reading that you went back there.
3459585	3459845	What?
3460045	3460466	Letterbees.
3460566	3462428	I went to the good letterbees, I didn't go to the ass letterbees.
3462668	3463209	Oh, okay, okay.
3463229	3466112	Who, by the way, fucked them for not sending me my free ice cream coupon yet.
3466192	3471277	I'm gonna call and, like, call their district manager and bitch them out.
3471377	3472839	Because I want my free ice cream, goddammit.
3472919	3473179	Anyway.
3473259	3474721	I know somebody who works there already.
3474741	3475502	But anyway, we'll go.
3477003	3478284	Yes, we got a good burp.
3478884	3481266	That burp is dedicated to the leather beans at Antelope.
3483207	3489532	And also, this one was brought to you not by Propel, it was brought to you by Martinelli's Cranberry Apple Sparking Cider.
3491693	3505003	Anyway, this guy in the truck, as we're leaving the guy to bond in on our great search for Jahi, this truck was like, not telling me, so you know what I did?
3505483	3506104	You know what I did?
3507629	3514274	I drove down to five miles an hour, and he couldn't pass me because there were cars coming.
3515074	3523940	So I went as slow as I could, and then I saw him about to duck over to turn, so I cut right in front of him and turned, right on to Madison.
3524640	3526261	And I went another five miles an hour.
3526722	3528043	He went to pass me, I cut him off.
3528923	3530264	He went to pass me, I cut him off.
3531685	3536128	And then I drove off into the sunset or a road, actually it was three in the morning or something like that.
3537771	3561453	into the darkness, into the dark black forest that's more appropriate for you, you drove off into the darkness from whence you came I was hoping that he would have drove past me so I could wave at him I love pissing off people when there's no traffic actually it's more like more than one ah, so you're the bitch he brought it on himself because he tailgated me, so fuck him yeah I'd also like to say um
3564588	3564968	You know what?
3565048	3567149	I'm really not that angsty about anything else.
3567769	3574291	There was this, like, scary person, though, that was at the virtual tour.
3574311	3574991	She was nice.
3576132	3577832	She was scary and wanted to talk to me.
3578392	3579753	It was definite Dawn Syndrome.
3580893	3585214	But I don't think anyone would get that unless they listened to 98 Rock right here.
3585594	3587115	You know what I'm talking about.
3589212	3591557	Disorderly and worthless nonsense.
3591798	3595806	It's basically when people come up to you and start idle conversations about nothing.
3595866	3598231	Like, say, for instance, you're standing in line.
3600799	3618128	I used to work there, like, I would do my internship in the morning when they were on air, and they would start doing that around the station, not even on their show, they would just start walking around doing it for no reason.
3618608	3619629	It was actually pretty funny.
3620229	3621850	But, yeah.
3622130	3623071	Well, we do that anyway.
3623091	3623231	Well, um...
3627774	3640170	I need to retract my FE to my CD player because now that I rigged it ghetto-style with paper, my faceplate stays on, although I can't turn down the volume or go back to listen to the track again.
3640330	3640991	Hooray, ghetto!
3646758	3650539	Another episode of the week goes toward the snack machine at my work.
3651339	3656241	Because in the morning, if I forget to eat my breakfast, the only thing that I have to eat is a NutriBrain bar out of the snack machine.
3656621	3657981	Our snack machine doesn't take dollars.
3659162	3662743	Or if it takes the dollar, it tells you to use correct change.
3663763	3665644	It also doesn't take nickels, dimes, or quarters.
3666344	3668225	So basically all that stuff.
3668245	3669825	And then it goes, ha, I can't get it.
3669845	3673366	It doesn't take a piece of pizza either.
3673406	3673626	Oh, gosh.
3678018	3678959	Not too angsty this week.
3704935	3705516	No!
3705876	3707857	I don't know, I've been just tired, so... No!
3710179	3713742	Tired not getting out because I'm trying to save money, so I'm not angsty.
3714523	3716465	Um, let's see here.
3717265	3719727	Oh, F you to the stupid bitch at, uh, release.
3720148	3723971	Listen, you stupid whore, um, I don't want your fucking sample.
3724191	3726393	I've said it to you before, and I said it to you again.
3726653	3727874	Stop trying to give me the damn sample.
3728274	3729636	Can she be a whore, really?
3729736	3730616	Who would pay for her?
3731537	3748226	I don't know if she's ugly, but anyways, yeah, she tried giving a sample to my friend, and it was like some taking rib on a stick, and she dropped the fucking thing down, down, slid down a little, you know, little cover there, it's like, and then like fell into like a basket full of chips or something like that.
3748906	3750548	and say, oh, let me give you another one!
3750988	3752249	He's like, no, that's fine.
3752990	3755272	But anyways, yeah, so F you to her because she's stupid.
3755773	3763741	And F you to pretty much everybody I talk to during the day at my work, except for my friend Andy, because you're all retarded and...
3764961	3765902	My god, I swear.
3766082	3771743	I think I may have mentioned this last week, but there was this... I had a big cup of hot chocolate.
3771943	3778045	Okay, I'm walking about six inches away from a rail that's up on the third floor balcony area where I work.
3778765	3779905	So what do the people try to do?
3779925	3783606	They try to cut between me and the six inch gap between the rail.
3783847	3788308	When there's a nice three feet or more, probably like six feet on the other side of me.
3789568	3799196	I mean, you... I think... I'm pretty convinced that everybody that works at VPD has no sense of, um... Well, let's see, no common sense.
3799596	3800917	They have no common sense whatsoever.
3800957	3802258	They're like, oh, I'm a split?
3803279	3804720	So, yeah.
3805360	3805841	F you to them.
3806221	3809203	F you to stupid drivers because you're still out there.
3810004	3810464	I hate you.
3811365	3814907	And F you to everybody that watches Oprah because, uh...
3816808	3819889	Because Oprah sucks and I loved it the other day.
3819910	3821330	Don't talk about my mother like that.
3822851	3825392	I loved it the other day after the Michael Jackson interview thing.
3825412	3826892	They're like doing a talkback.
3827432	3830413	Like acting like they're experts on the whole subject and everything.
3830473	3834655	And they absolutely had... I don't even think any of them watched the special.
3835370	3838232	and they're just talking back for a good two hours about the damn thing.
3838312	3839432	I just saw some... Oh, look!
3839612	3841493	Jack is still not talking about it.
3841513	3844895	Turned channel to, like, Vader's Gym or something like that.
3845616	3846736	Stupid fucking people.
3846836	3846876	Um...
3849210	3851612	F you to the people in the Congo.
3852733	3855094	I'm going to fucking cast an Ebola spell on your whole country.
3855315	3855675	So there.
3855915	3856856	What are you going to do now?
3857236	3857977	I'm in another country.
3858717	3859338	You can't touch me.
3860398	3860999	You're going to die.
3861179	3861699	From Ebola.
3861859	3862920	They'll cast rockets.
3869114	3873216	I weep for humanity, and these people that I weep, you know, cause me to weep.
3873556	3878338	That and the whole fact that they're shutting down the Folsom Dam because of the threat of terrorism.
3878658	3885741	Because, you know, people are going to come out of the middle of nowhere and just bomb the dam instead of, you know, bombing LA, San Francisco, you know, one of the major cities.
3885801	3888562	If Folsom Dam gets bombed, wouldn't it just flood the prison?
3889283	3891504	It would flood Sacramento with 12 feet of water.
3891524	3892444	Which I wouldn't listen to.
3896218	3898559	Do you realize how much Loki is like Nelson from the Simpsons?
3898679	3898899	Uh-huh!
3914723	3915804	Oh, and the best one.
3916044	3917966	I just laughed my ass off when I saw this.
3918226	3922790	That'd be the stupid doctors that botched that fucking transplant.
3922871	3925353	I mean, that was hilarious.
3925693	3927935	The thing was labeled correctly.
3928716	3929957	A... was it A?
3930717	3931238	I don't know.
3931598	3933280	The organs were A and the girl was O.
3934208	3939450	There doesn't go, there's a type of people trying to, you know, shove their round block through the square hole.
3940511	3942632	Were they, were they, they weren't Kaiser, were they?
3942732	3943992	It's so stupid.
3944273	3945313	They're like trying to save her.
3945353	3946714	I'm like, dude, she's so dead.
3950373	3951474	And I'm like, so surprised.
3951635	3952916	Oh my god, she died!
3953136	3954217	I can't believe it!
3954718	3956380	So shock, how could this happen?
3957581	3961485	And there's her parents, though, who think, oh, we want a second opinion to see if she's a little brain dead.
3962807	3963748	Uh, let's see here.
3963768	3966571	I mean, I feel bad for them.
3967191	3969752	that their daughter was lost due to incompetence.
3969952	3972734	I don't know, I'm no doctor or anything, but she's not moving and shit.
3973014	3977496	But, no brain, I don't see how you can simulate a lack of brain activity.
3977976	3978897	Oh, well, she's brain dead.
3978937	3983659	I don't know how you can get a second, you know, two tests that show zero brain activity.
3984479	3989101	I mean, unless blind hope, blind faith, you know, wanting to grasp at anything.
3990262	3994264	But, the first step towards healing and grieving...
3995081	3997203	is realizing that you actually have something to grieve.
3997543	4000626	We poked her with a stick, man.
4001427	4002167	Oh yeah, another thing.
4002788	4005991	F you to the stupid people in Rhode Island that got caught in that stupid fire.
4006111	4006871	I know you're all dead.
4006891	4008353	Isn't that a great white concert?
4008373	4009394	Hold on, hold on, hold on.
4013437	4015418	I'm not going to cover what you're talking about.
4015458	4018259	But what's hilarious is they're like, oh my god, this is so tragic.
4018279	4022101	Hello, they just used the one exit instead of the three fire exits that are built in this place.
4022582	4024082	Oh, they're trying to get out the one door.
4024102	4028624	Everyone's like, but there's exits over here marked fire exits in case of fire.
4028725	4030185	Like, that's happening right now.
4030205	4032826	Oops.
4033327	4035048	Yeah, I cry through humanity.
4039075	4045080	All right, I have something to say about it.
4045200	4048942	I have something to say about it.
4049503	4050464	I have something to say about this.
4050504	4059010	As long as we're... As long as we're... As long as we're joking about, you know, tragic events in the news, I have some things I'd like to say.
4060911	4078436	Okay, F you to the band Great White for setting that club on fire and killing a bunch of people, because I had to wait 45 minutes to get into the club last night, because they actually had to enforce the fire code, because you dolts burned down a club on the other side of the country.
4078716	4085478	And I don't know if you've seen the video of this, but like when the thing's set on fire, all these people are looking at the roof going, dude, I think there's something on fire.
4086238	4087680	I thought the club was on fire.
4087980	4091203	When I stand there high off my ass going, dude, there's an 80s hairband.
4091283	4093405	No, I would be high-tailing it out the fucking door.
4093485	4095947	I'd push and trample all you people.
4096748	4097648	God.
4100291	4102273	And you know what the saddest thing about this whole thing is?
4103494	4106056	Album sales are going to go through the roof for these guys.
4106376	4106977	Pun intended.
4108678	4110520	Great White is going to actually have a career again.
4113208	4115590	That's the real tragedy here, ladies and gentlemen.
4115750	4117751	Great White will bring the house down.
4121993	4123274	I choked on my shrimp chips.
4123914	4124235	Alright.
4126562	4132184	Anyway, moving on, my other FUs of the week are mudslides on I-5.
4132904	4140066	Because of mudslides on I-5, and I'm not talking about the drink, I'm talking about the actual mud sliding down the hill and covering the freeway.
4140406	4146488	Because of that, we heard that traffic was blocked for hours, so we had to go down 101 to get to LA.
4146548	4148109	That took like seven and a half hours.
4149549	4150049	I hated it.
4150869	4153830	Well, no, I didn't hate it because, you know, we were with good company, so it was all good.
4156611	4161014	Part of the countryside alongside the grapevine was on fire.
4162235	4162435	Cool.
4162475	4164977	We were stuck in traffic for three hours on the grapevine.
4165837	4169160	And then we went by and saw helicopters and fire, and I took pictures of it.
4169800	4171261	Was Great White playing there, too?
4172082	4172922	Actually, yes.
4173062	4173242	No.
4176685	4177005	All right.
4179207	4180748	Also, what else did my F use of the week?
4181128	4181228	Oh.
4183329	4185591	F. F. Stupid Children.
4187887	4190190	Remember JB and I eat children.
4190430	4193133	Children ramen.
4195376	4196557	We've come up with different flavors.
4196898	4199040	There's RVGL flavor that tastes like skank.
4200542	4204486	And you know, Scandia flavor which is pretty crunchy and tasty.
4204506	4205788	The CCL flavor tastes like ass.
4207749	4208230	I got a few.
4208290	4213793	One is to the jackass over in Scandia who thought it would be a good idea to try to punk everybody out of their tokens on the machine.
4228741	4232242	He was like, I went up to go play a game, and there were like three tokens sitting up there.
4232282	4237664	He came up and tried to steal my token, and then he tried to yell at me and start a fight with me on the extreme machine.
4248112	4265477	and then he went off and he like got mad because he didn't get to play which he was just out to take people's tokens he would start punching the carousel thinking like that's a good way to get rid of the stress and also little kids who think there's a crosswalk across the DDR panels
4267998	4268939	It's pretty simple.
4268959	4271661	This is a raging epidemic in every arcade, I'm sure.
4271761	4274944	Little kids who somehow see a crosswalk right there.
4275865	4276785	What is up with that?
4276845	4279768	Were you there when I grabbed the little kid and took her to his parents?
4279788	4281189	Yes, yes, I was.
4281249	4281769	That was fabulous.
4281789	4285232	Your child is going to end up with a broken foot if you don't watch your little kid.
4286213	4289315	Because we were playing VR back when it was the USA Mission.
4289335	4289456	Yep.
4291733	4314860	And this little kid proceeds to walk across the machine and I grabbed the kid and took him to his parents This dates all the way back to the first episode of the show If you won't take care of your kids, god damn it, I will That was a quote from the very first episode from Jamie When I was sitting there and they had the little kids running across there I looked at a friend of mine, I don't know who it was And I said, is there a crosswalk across the machine?
4315360	4317221	and his kid's mom heard me.
4317361	4318482	His kid's mom heard me.
4318682	4321163	She's all, excuse me, but I told him not to be doing that.
4321263	4323524	I said, I wasn't even talking to you.
4323684	4326026	I was just saying it, like, in general.
4326046	4327266	I was yelling at your child.
4327526	4330328	Shoot, there were so kids I wish I could be.
4330548	4334530	And also, a big FU to the drunk lady in Scandia on Friday.
4334550	4338592	She claimed she was from Brazil, Texas, New York, and, like, Europe somewhere.
4339092	4344155	And she kept telling everybody how sexy they were, and she was so bombed out and drunk.
4344895	4345857	It was pretty cool.
4345957	4347499	And also, the last one was good.
4347539	4348220	It was pretty cool.
4348300	4349061	It was pretty cool.
4349121	4350042	It was pretty cool.
4350162	4350903	It was pretty cool.
4355473	4360474	I went over there yesterday and I'm trying to pick out some soda to drink.
4360514	4366476	And this lady comes up trying to put soda in my cart, trying to tell me that this is what you should get and this is what you should drink.
4366736	4368296	And I was like, no.
4368356	4375118	And she's like, I ended up just leaving my cart and walking out of the store because she put like four 12-packs in my thing after I told her no.
4375158	4377178	And I was like, screw you, and I left.
4377198	4378719	Because she was a bitch.
4379239	4380019	And driver's divorce.
4382722	4383362	Yes, Jamie.
4383442	4385424	I have another one.
4387886	4389147	I think I just forgot what it was.
4391689	4395492	He was talking about the drunk woman at Scandia, Texas, Brazil.
4396292	4397013	Yes, I remember.
4397753	4402537	Outside Target, there's these guys who will say, Hi, I'm taking a communication class, blah, blah, blah.
4402557	4404418	This was part of, I think, Melody's Fuck You last week.
4404799	4408702	Because there was someone who was incredibly rude to her with this.
4409302	4412364	But, it feels gift-y to you, all these lines, and then they try to sell you magazines.
4412424	4419267	So finally, I looked over to the guy, he says, yeah, I'm doing a communication project, and by the way, you know, I just wanted to talk to all the pretty women in the park.
4419287	4419787	I'm like, okay.
4420308	4421808	First of all, I don't want to buy magazines.
4422589	4423729	Oh, you've already talked to somebody.
4424089	4427551	Know that my friend has them, quite honestly, no money belongs in my own goddamn pocket.
4427691	4428091	Not in yours.
4429712	4432454	And he's just like, don't you wanna buy one?
4432514	4434595	I'm like, no, I'm not nice, leave.
4435135	4435615	So he left.
4436116	4436476	Fuck him.
4437816	4439577	Another one, back to CCL.
4439877	4441138	Oops, sorry.
4441158	4450203	When they thought, like, they tell everyone that their pads are all in good condition, why did I feel like I had doubles heavy, like, in the middle of the song, and none of the right pad work?
4450763	4455885	and the stupid little rabbit girl who, like, would not stay off of the pad when I was trying to get up.
4455925	4463168	I, like, seriously, if I was a girl who would be a rabbit girl, I would be a rabbit girl.
4463228	4467129	I should have stepped on her clothing a little more.
4467369	4468410	She walked away.
4470651	4473232	Alright, let's move on to the chatroom FUs, shall we?
4473272	4475152	Play happy music.
4475172	4476373	Brace yourself, there's a ton.
4478581	4498858	Muhimer says, fuck word problems, fuck winter storms that lead to flooding of the massive sort, fuck my school for saying that school was cancelled Thursday because of snow and then deciding to change their minds a full day the night before, fuck my dad for still not getting cable so I can have wireless with my laptop and download Mutros DDR stuff, sad face, fuck my heater for breaking also, and fuck the new one for causing my allergies to annihilate me.
4500219	4504643	EvilNauki2DX says, fuck you to people who don't know how to follow forum rules.
4506243	4506603	Beautiful.
4508224	4510104	DarkTetsuya says, F you to being single.
4510384	4510665	Amen.
4511325	4515466	Winamp3 for crashing consistently on my MP3 CDs and one more I can't think of.
4515646	4516586	Oh, wait, I remembered.
4517027	4520228	Oh, F you to Sky for playing that shitty Vanessa May song.
4520548	4521908	Now I know such a thing exists.
4522288	4525209	I have a shitty Vanessa May song from Dance Mania 9.
4525930	4526870	It's some remix.
4527150	4532252	There's like no violin and like one verse of hers looped.
4532332	4532892	It's horrible.
4532932	4533352	It's awful.
4533412	4533832	It's putrid.
4533852	4534833	I'll play it for you after the show.
4536173	4536933	It's really sad.
4537033	4540114	But it's a remix, so it doesn't really count.
4540254	4540995	It's not really hard, then.
4541175	4542055	Yeah, exactly.
4544716	4547336	Hey, I got a nephew.
4547396	4552618	RiceRYC3 says, Fuck you, Gray Davis, for cutting the funds for my school.
4552718	4554779	I need my damn classes to transfer ASAP.
4559232	4561434	They're, like, upping it to $24 a unit instead of $11.
4561554	4563736	So, it's absolutely pointless.
4564337	4567579	Did you know, folks, that college is completely useless and was a waste of money?
4567699	4573224	All those people that get out of college end up coming to work at my work, and they get entry-level positions.
4573485	4578949	Whereas I haven't gone to college, or I tried going to college for a semester, and said, this is fucking boring and a waste of my money.
4580010	4583273	And I'm earning, maybe not as much as they are, but you know what?
4583293	4584814	They gotta pay back those college loans.
4584895	4586296	So, technically, I'm above them.
4587404	4594249	The one advantage of going to college at least for three years is that companies, when they hire you, they do have to hire you for a little bit more.
4595550	4597411	If you've had, like, two or more years of college.
4597932	4598392	I've had three!
4600454	4604477	I wonder if I got screwed at my company, because I've had three, even though I don't have a piece of paper to show it.
4606075	4610676	Daft Square says, fuck everybody who doesn't like oatmeal raisin cookies because they fucking rule.
4611097	4611737	I hate raisins.
4612117	4612457	Die.
4613817	4615158	What about just oatmeal cookies then?
4615498	4616458	That was Daft Square.
4616838	4618339	Oh, well don't die, but I hate raisins.
4618979	4620300	I like oatmeal chocolate chip cookies.
4621420	4623060	How about like... Oatmeal cream pies!
4624081	4624481	Okay.
4625527	4627910	Oatmeal Cookies are like, official costumes in here.
4628611	4632937	She gets her oatmeal cookie fixes in other ways, that's fine.
4633117	4636302	23rd Magus says, fuck you to the worm that's still going through these net servers.
4636342	4638064	It probably brought down LiveJournal the other day.
4638204	4640467	Actually, a denial of service attack brought down LiveJournal.
4640507	4641468	Fuck people to do that.
4642029	4642410	Jesus.
4642770	4644673	The denialist, you know what denialist service attack is?
4644693	4652423	That's when you get like all the computers that like paying a server like Yahoo or CNN or whatever to try and take it down, to overload it and take it down.
4652704	4653926	That's what happened to LiveJournal the other day.
4654286	4656970	But you know they credited all the paid users with four extra days because of it.
4657708	4657988	Really?
4658689	4659570	Okay, I didn't notice.
4660030	4660651	Yep, they did.
4660691	4661972	Mine's paid through June anyway.
4662532	4663653	Well, now it's paid through June 4th.
4665034	4668357	Okay, stupid fucking lamer hackers, I agree.
4668877	4669478	Fuck them, I say.
4669558	4671460	Fuck them in their ears, because their asses ain't good enough.
4671700	4676344	If they wanted their accounts to be cool, they should pay for it.
4676424	4677284	It's $25 for a year.
4677965	4678966	Fuck all of you, I'm sorry.
4679406	4681908	Well, I mean, but the LiveJournal went down for the paid users, too.
4681928	4682729	I mean, that sucks.
4682749	4683850	But yeah, but it's their fault.
4685672	4689143	Fuck Skrull, as usual, and fuck taking a zero period during lunch.
4689263	4691029	I can't eat lunch anymore, bitches.
4691530	4692232	Is that legal?
4695057	4698938	I actually had an issue with that back in seventh grade.
4699338	4702680	By law, they have to give you time to at least buy your lunch.
4702740	4705120	You can't have like five days of lunch.
4705180	4706821	You have to be able to eat lunch.
4706861	4707881	It is against the law.
4708762	4710042	That is so weird.
4710962	4715244	And I thought zero period meant... I thought zero... This is 23rd magazine.
4715804	4718825	Zero period was called zero period because it was before first period.
4721030	4723051	or, you know, well, I guess it depends.
4723271	4723871	I guess it depends.
4724051	4725272	Like, our schools didn't have a home.
4725292	4726192	We didn't have a home.
4726212	4728173	We had a home at my school, but it's now down.
4728713	4732475	And the thing is, it is against the law for them to deny you your lunch time.
4732495	4737358	So if you know what you need to do, you need to find whatever documentation you have on that.
4737758	4740479	Send it not only to the school board, send it to the PTA.
4741480	4743841	I guarantee you the soccer mobs are going to be on there.
4744932	4746333	That's right, stick the soccer moms on him.
4746453	4747654	Excellent suggestion.
4747935	4748595	That's your job.
4748635	4749456	They look thick.
4749576	4750797	Ooh, I can pitch you something.
4750877	4752258	Mama Jamie's looking out for you.
4752638	4753839	Stick the soccer moms on him.
4757239	4769788	Alright, uh, and you thought 23rd Magus' Angst was over, no, fuck you to Burning Heat SSR, oh, he's old school there, for being so friggin' hard to beat, and own you to We Will Rock You, easiest kata ever, out.
4770929	4772310	We Will Rock You's not a kata.
4772330	4773351	It is not a kata.
4773371	4774592	It's like a six.
4774832	4776113	Unless, oh, maybe on doubles.
4776693	4778074	No, not even on doubles, dude.
4778694	4779255	No way.
4779535	4780275	That's like, oh.
4780636	4780856	Dude, dude.
4780876	4783077	Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
4783097	4785038	Yeah, I thought it was only like seven or eight at the most.
4785058	4785819	Wait, wait, wait.
4786900	4788721	You got a heart, Jamie, in the chat room?
4788781	4790582	I don't know.
4790722	4791182	Just because.
4793044	4794525	Just explain to me why I have a heart.
4794945	4796666	DarkTetsu, you put we heart DS.
4797346	4798127	Oh, thank you.
4799228	4800308	I don't have a heart, though.
4801169	4802610	I have a lump of coal like Smurfette.
4802630	4803510	You do, it's just black.
4804211	4805972	I have a lump of coal like Smurfette.
4807620	4811483	And if you don't remember, when Smurfette showed up, she had black hair and had a heart of coal.
4812123	4814925	Okay, this is what 23 Magazine is elaborating.
4815005	4817587	Okay, 23 Magazine is answering some of your questions here.
4817927	4824372	Okay, he can't go before school, can't make it, for whatever reason, so he has to go during lunch, which means he cannot eat.
4824412	4826353	Either I give up lunch or I give up graduating.
4827514	4828034	I don't buy it.
4828074	4828915	Take it to the PTA.
4829015	4831677	I mean, not that I don't believe you, but take it to the PTA.
4831697	4836160	They, by law, have to find a way to make that work for you to have lunch.
4837873	4845257	No, what we actually ended up doing was the parents got together and they sent a letter to the district superintendent.
4845337	4847319	And he was the one who went and changed all that around.
4847759	4850861	And he actually made it so we didn't have to do it.
4850881	4855323	That we actually didn't have to take the class.
4855343	4857124	You need to send that to the authority.
4857184	4857945	Don't sit on this.
4858025	4859446	Make sure that something gets taken care of.
4860246	4861287	Be an activist.
4862828	4865589	Nothing ever changes until you make it change.
4866290	4866510	Right?
4867373	4868852	Yep, very true, very true.
4871176	4871596	All right.
4872497	4873757	Black Lab has some FUs.
4873817	4874297	Puppy.
4874757	4875938	Puppy, why aren't you here?
4875958	4876638	Fuck the cold.
4876718	4878039	It's been making my skin break out.
4878079	4878799	Fuck midterms.
4878839	4879179	I hate them.
4879199	4879619	They suck.
4879659	4884421	Fuck my suitemates for smoking weed every day this past two weeks and making the whole suit sweet stink.
4884921	4886862	Fuck this sore throat that just came up this morning.
4886902	4888623	Fuck my horrible sleep pattern right now.
4888663	4889803	I keep sleeping through classes.
4889983	4890343	One more.
4890443	4896806	Fuck Tapioca Express for not turning up the volume on their machine even after I spent two hours cleaning the pads for them.
4897666	4899187	Wow, that's dedication right there.
4899207	4899287	Shit.
4901500	4902640	Oh my god!
4902660	4906582	Hey, it's a novel!
4906882	4908442	You people are raping this privilege.
4909042	4910463	Alright, here we go.
4910523	4912764	SnubDisanoid says, Big old fat F you.
4912784	4913964	That's an understatement here, too.
4914044	4920466	First off, fuck you to the people at CCL who decided that just because someone stringed the machine for tons of credits, it was okay to hog the machine like a bunch of motherfuckers.
4920966	4925868	I had to wait 90 minutes for one fucking game of DDR, and it was versus with some pretentious and not very good little...
4926828	4927889	The blanket is blank.
4928209	4929910	Even I, that's too dirty for me to read.
4931812	4937555	Little come in his shit, asshole.
4938436	4941258	It made me play on the two-player pads, which suck major ass.
4941678	4945040	Secondly, fuck you to CCL for not fixing the two-player pads for so long.
4945120	4945701	I understand.
4946401	4949563	That it's hard to repair the pads when people string the machine so excessively.
4949983	4954586	But it's been about two months now and the down and right arrows don't work unless you weigh 400 pounds.
4954806	4956567	So fuck them for having such shitty pads.
4956847	4957427	Okay, hold on.
4957547	4961390	I've never met the DubZipNoid guy or whatever his name is.
4962290	4962790	Who is he?
4962950	4968073	Because I talked to someone last night for like, while we were waiting after everyone filled all the pre-credits.
4968213	4970855	I don't know, is he like an Asian dude?
4972333	4973033	I have no idea.
4973053	4975594	You guys should meet offline or something.
4975614	4976494	This is horrible radio.
4976514	4978555	Why doesn't anyone watch those cameras?
4978635	4981875	And they have, like... What's the point of having cameras?
4983276	4985836	They're like those fake ones you buy at the store, the candy cameras.
4987517	4988137	They have them.
4988557	4993018	All you can see, though, are, like, the lights of the speakers and the talk.
4993038	4994759	You can't see anywhere down on the bottom.
4994779	4998780	Didn't they say in clips that people usually try to be honest and they think they're being watched?
4999300	4999580	Very true.
5002741	5007043	Fuck the dumb little bitches that decided to drive on the shoulder in their Mustang and then merge with traffic.
5007363	5008504	Somebody did that to me the other day.
5008584	5009044	I hate that.
5009444	5010585	Almost fucking slamming into us.
5010645	5013406	I hate to call anyone a bitch, but they fucking deserved it.
5013746	5016427	And after almost slamming into us, they laughed like giddy-ass schoolgirls.
5016467	5016888	Fuck you.
5019149	5021210	You know, I have an explanation on that.
5021390	5022290	Fuck big trucks.
5023110	5024251	We try to run you off the road.
5026332	5026592	Yeah.
5027888	5031631	And finally, fuck you to the Queen Kong gorilla girl that fucking butchered my hair.
5031711	5034753	If my hair slips through your fingers, don't cut my fucking hair, please.
5035173	5041677	I asked for a trim so I don't look like a hobo while keeping my sort of sideburns and I get half my fucking hair shaved off.
5042217	5046160	I don't have sideburns and my head looked like a fucking mushroom for three weeks.
5046240	5046640	Fuck that.
5046860	5047501	Well, there you go.
5047561	5049162	Did you see anyone that looked like a mushroom, Zero?
5055915	5062680	I think this is a new person listening to the show, so hello to Ninja Usagi Koi, which means bunny, does it?
5064481	5067403	Yes, either that's Koios in love or Koios in fish.
5068937	5069637	What about Usagi?
5069677	5070198	Is that bunny?
5070518	5071418	Is that bunny love?
5071458	5072159	Ninja bunny love?
5072719	5073499	Ninja bunny love.
5073960	5074380	Awesome.
5075160	5075480	That's cool.
5075721	5078962	My sister would love you because my sister is a total bunny addict.
5079462	5081924	Unless it's a Sailor Moon reference, which is weird.
5082144	5082484	Who knows?
5083084	5087707	Anyway, I want to send an FU to my friend for playing Involuntary Twister with me on DDR.
5089327	5089968	Sounds kinky.
5090028	5091669	Did you get that on film?
5095030	5095351	Alright.
5097111	5097531	Let's see.
5098252	5104073	JB says, my FU goes to SyFam having to be in Italy, so it'll take forever for my customized CD order for them to get there.
5104433	5107815	An FU to the Safari Trance mix for Jamie sounding blah.
5108915	5109595	Send it to me anyway.
5109615	5110455	Send me what you have to find.
5111076	5112656	You can't mix Safari to Trance.
5112696	5113256	It doesn't work.
5113316	5114557	It's like Jungle in the Trance.
5115317	5118978	Actually, I want to make a suggestion for a new monthly contest.
5120516	5122157	We haven't even finished the rules for our other one.
5122177	5125778	Let's finish this one, though, but I have a really good idea.
5125798	5126998	Finish the Vikings first.
5127078	5127358	Okay.
5128118	5131279	VidPawa says, F you to cartoon heroes for being hard.
5131399	5131779	I agree.
5132379	5135680	F you to teachers who yell at your class when you haven't done anything wrong.
5136240	5137001	F you to homework.
5137161	5138181	F you to research papers.
5138221	5141522	And finally, F you to people who vandalize apartments that your family owns.
5141982	5143562	Luckily, no one lives in those apartments.
5144283	5144743	Yes.
5146584	5147524	Too much crime in Vegas.
5148265	5150546	USFVB says, fuck you to every new program.
5150566	5153448	For some reason they always find the stupidest fucking person to talk to.
5155850	5156870	Okay.
5157130	5157431	Okay.
5157891	5161013	Vandalist says, F you to all the freaking mosquitoes out there.
5161233	5161573	Amen.
5168700	5169702	That's like 85% of your friends.
5184246	5190330	Well, I'll tell you my suggestion during one of the breaks, and we'll see if it's... Okay, we'll do that.
5190550	5192511	In fact, we'll go ahead and take a quick break right now.
5192531	5196374	I'm going to bring up some shirt that USFBB gave me a site.
5196394	5197454	We'll look at that during the break, too.
5198335	5200696	And we've got the second half of the CyberBeat stuff.
5200716	5202697	The post-freestyle interview is coming up.
5202797	5204178	Those should be very interesting.
5204859	5208581	In the meantime, we're going to take a quick break, and we'll start it off with... I don't know, what?
5209061	5209682	What should we hear, Jamie?
5209702	5209882	Let's see.
5211145	5212166	Um, you know what?
5212266	5214567	How about in celebration of my very first seven star?
5215687	5216228	Oh, okay.
5217208	5218209	Oh, God, I hope I have it.
5218629	5219309	Uh, I know I do.
5219409	5219790	I know I do.
5219830	5220170	I know I do.
5221751	5222591	I know I do somewhere.
5223331	5224112	Okay, we'll do that.
5225392	5226353	Alright, we'll be back.
5313248	5313749	and many more.
5544098	5549881	Please listen to Orange Lounge Radio, because real radio makes Captain Jack cry.
5554994	5556435	That's brilliant.
5583432	5592827	We posted a link in the chatroom, by the way, which is a shirt that I'm going to make out of a banner that I made a long time ago for Under Sedation Live.
5594668	5595668	That shirt rules.
5596469	5596949	They have one.
5597429	5598989	They have Clit R Us instead of Toys R Us.
5599469	5600210	Asthma is sexy.
5600230	5601310	This is my favorite one, though.
5601610	5603310	On the front, it's a front and back shirt.
5603350	5606231	On the front, it says, there's two people fucking on the back of my shirt.
5606551	5608492	And then on the back, it says, just kidding, believe in Jesus.
5609152	5612433	And it has this picture of Jesus that looks like Buddy Christ or something.
5613193	5613653	It's great.
5613693	5615834	And then the other one, where were some of the other ones that were funny?
5617773	5622015	There's one that's in really small print on the front that says, if you're already this close, why don't you just suck my dick?
5623536	5625036	Go to the ones that are worse than hell.
5625256	5626937	I want to see what the really bad ones are.
5626957	5635861	If these are the bad ones... I used to listen to NSYNC when they were in Underground.
5639304	5640846	You fucked my mother?
5641206	5642647	I like that, even Jesus hates greed.
5642667	5642968	That's great.
5642988	5643989	Guns don't kill people.
5644029	5645530	Mario Van Peebles!
5659048	5659729	Okay.
5660769	5662130	I like some of the... Hold on, hold on.
5662510	5663551	I came on on the... Here, here.
5663591	5665052	I want to see the really bad ones.
5665072	5665872	I want to see the really bad ones.
5665892	5667393	Because there's a section called Worse Than Hell.
5667794	5668574	Let's look at these here.
5668834	5669455	Ooh, it's purple.
5669595	5671916	We do not condone purchasing these shirts.
5673257	5675058	I swear, I didn't know she was three.
5677480	5678820	I went to Washington, D.C.
5678880	5680902	and all I got was shot by the sniper.
5688829	5715103	I fucking hate, oh man, no way am I reading that one, I'll read it, I'll read it, I'll read it, no, no, no, no, no, no, there are some lines even this show can't cross, I'm sorry, Mary had a little lamb with the lamb humping Mary, that's great, here, here, please, hit control D,
5716877	5718958	Yeah, that one's really bad, Loki.
5719558	5721559	If you go to the site, you'll know which one we're talking about.
5721619	5724460	It just starts with I hate dot dot dot and has this whole list.
5724840	5725621	That's just too much.
5725901	5727541	Although the punchline's really funny.
5729002	5731143	I helped fund international terrorism.
5732503	5733224	That's awful.
5734804	5735225	Oh no.
5736325	5737605	Abortions tickle.
5739246	5740327	That's awful.
5741427	5743168	There's just some awful shirts here.
5743188	5743748	This is great.
5746078	5747299	School Shootings Tour.
5747319	5748800	It's got all this list.
5749340	5750121	That's awful.
5752122	5758887	Oh boy.
5761629	5764091	The pictures on some of these are awful.
5765211	5765972	I wouldn't wear that.
5769846	5771367	I'm sorry, I think this one's funny.
5771427	5772928	The one that says, I went to Washington, D.C.
5772968	5774969	and all I got was shot by the sniper.
5775869	5779531	Now that Jesus did it for the chicks one, I should buy that shirt and wear it to my old church.
5780251	5781512	Oh, my lord.
5782612	5783613	One more time for you, Loki.
5791396	5791917	Okay.
5792437	5794338	This is, by the way, tshirthell.com.
5794558	5796819	And we're looking at the worse than hell shirts right now.
5799367	5800650	Thanks for watching!
5813157	5814618	Let's see, I can kick your baby's ass.
5814938	5815538	Potty head.
5816158	5817459	I enjoy spanking.
5817639	5818619	I enjoy good spanking.
5818699	5819440	Smell my diaper.
5819460	5820900	Fuck the milk, where's the whiskey tits?
5822521	5824302	My IQ is higher than the president's.
5824762	5827343	I shit my pants and all I got was a lousy t-shirt.
5827363	5829844	That's awful!
5829864	5833306	Are you kidding that?
5833386	5834146	Are you my daddy?
5835246	5837207	My pee-pee is bigger than yours.
5838488	5840169	I hide in my crack in my diaper.
5841329	5843530	You said I hide in my crack in my diaper?
5843590	5844991	I hide my crack in my diaper.
5846091	5847111	Oh my god.
5847171	5848312	Alright, alright, alright, alright.
5848952	5850113	Enough of the t-shirt hell.
5850833	5851653	What were we going to talk about?
5851673	5853494	We wanted to talk about something when we came back?
5854194	5855775	Oh, you wanted to talk about some contests I did.
5855795	5856795	Big Black Cock.
5856815	5859617	But you want to talk about the contest now or are we going to wait until we wrap up the other contest?
5859637	5861617	We're going to wrap up the other contest first though, right?
5861637	5862918	We should start it next month, I think.
5863058	5863338	Alright.
5864178	5868520	We're going to have the remix challenge.
5868860	5870081	Where we give you a song...
5871698	5876519	and we give you a style and you need to remix the song in the style.
5877639	5883021	And we will give points to people and we're going to have this running for a whole year.
5883561	5885441	Okay, so we're going to hear all kinds of neat stuff.
5885821	5889502	You have a month to finish your particular mix.
5889542	5892583	Like the one, the last challenge that I gave out, we'll go ahead and extend it.
5892983	5894263	The Safari Trance Mix.
5894723	5895043	Sick.
5895804	5897784	You know, we could do Remember Me, Happy Hardcore.
5900455	5903198	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
5924497	5926538	But, you know, we'll offer this.
5927018	5929960	We're going to give out points based on how well your mix is.
5930461	5935244	Whoever has the best, you know, the highest number of points at the end of the year gets a fabulous prize.
5935324	5936285	I'm not talking about a shit prize.
5936345	5937906	I'm talking about fabulous.
5938546	5939847	We don't know what kind of fabulous prize.
5939967	5941729	Well, I mean, it is a year away.
5941769	5948353	If we put up enough money, you can get one of those nice DJ-in-a-boxes for like $400 or $300, and it's got two turntables.
5948893	5949314	Fuck that.
5949354	5950895	If I'm buying one of those, I'm buying it for me.
5950915	5950995	Sure.
5952486	5954547	I was hoping it was going to be for me, but whatever, anyways.
5955047	5955227	Yeah.
5956048	5959170	And even hosts can participate, because I'm grading.
5959970	5961291	So it's all going to be Jamie grading?
5961971	5962931	So I can enter the remixes?
5962972	5963952	It'll be me and a panel.
5964612	5965513	Okay, you and a panel.
5966093	5966874	A panel of what?
5968775	5970015	Can you get negative scores?
5971516	5972596	If it's really bad, yeah.
5973017	5973937	If it's twin, yeah.
5974417	5975998	I was waiting for someone to say that.
5977259	5979200	I'll enter if you can get negative scores, because mine's so bad.
5980382	5982344	I don't know, I've heard pretty bad.
5982804	5985366	But anyway, we'll start this up next month.
5986346	5990550	But first, we've got to finish the rules for our DWI contest we're going to be doing.
5990730	5991951	That's still going on too.
5992011	5997555	That's still going on, but we really haven't announced the official rules because we've been lazy and out of town and what have you, drunk, whatever.
5998655	6001397	But we'll have the full details on that next week, we swear.
6001778	6007442	The DWI contest where all the DWIs must be to old school TV themes.
6007742	6013824	Yes, no remixes, no movies, just TV themes.
6014124	6015425	Didn't we say we were going to allow movies?
6015725	6016025	I don't know.
6016225	6017145	Okay, no movies.
6019026	6020446	We'll have the full rules for you next week.
6020907	6023387	I'm personally looking forward to seeing one done to the greatest American hero.
6024728	6027429	Not that you're hinting what's going to get your vote.
6027809	6028009	No.
6028709	6029670	I just said I'm looking forward to it.
6029690	6031170	It doesn't mean I'm actually going to vote for it.
6032871	6033611	It should be excluded.
6034291	6034671	Shut up.
6035912	6036492	Shut up, intern.
6038490	6039070	Shut up, intern.
6039430	6041331	Oh, so now Zero X is the official intern.
6041431	6042031	He's our intern.
6042111	6042592	Okay, cool.
6043132	6048634	Because Black Lab is, I'm sorry, Puppy, is our foreign correspondent from the People's Republic of Davis.
6048654	6049754	He's also our PR bitch.
6050094	6050915	Yes, our PR bitch.
6051715	6053596	And so now we have Zero as our intern.
6053636	6055556	Who else do we have to have a title on this show?
6055576	6056357	Dave's our mascot.
6056417	6057257	Dave's our mascot.
6058537	6058878	Who else?
6060538	6061239	What's Brad?
6061439	6062439	Brad is the official Brad.
6065700	6066881	Bradley is the official Bradley.
6068573	6069054	Alright, alright.
6071156	6072097	We'll work on titles later.
6072337	6074379	Okay, oh yeah, JB is the SyFam horn.
6074639	6075600	Yes, they're SyFam horns.
6076838	6086344	Speaking of which, should we get into the cage match now, or do we want to do the second half of the... Okay, we'll do the cage match, then we'll come back and do the second half of the interviews while we tally the votes, maybe?
6087184	6092087	Actually, no, wait, I still have to find that part in the tape, so it's going to be a little bit, but I'll do that during cage match.
6092547	6094268	Anyway, okay, then we'll get into the cage match.
6094889	6097270	Jamie, talk about the cage match, in case we have anyone new listening tonight.
6098631	6101873	Well, we play songs, each of us picks one.
6102871	6106972	Um, whichever one won last week, of course, the person who chose that song does not get to choose a new one.
6107552	6112014	And you use the chat room and vote on what you think is best and it goes into rotation for a week.
6112634	6114614	It goes into rotation during our Bomani Music Amore program.
6115375	6115615	Yeah.
6115795	6117315	Always on this channel when we're not here.
6117675	6118576	Unless I'm going live.
6119496	6121796	Or I did a fuck-off this week for the first time in like two weeks.
6122157	6123277	Ooh, a whole two weeks.
6123297	6123857	Yeah, a whole two weeks.
6123877	6125257	I was doing like two a week, wasn't I?
6125778	6128038	Yeah, you were a fuck-off whore for a while.
6128938	6129559	Oh, yeah, yeah.
6129579	6130359	Blink, blink, blink, blink.
6132794	6134035	Last week on Orange Lounge Radio.
6134155	6136597	Okay, so let's get into the cage match.
6139680	6146846	Last week on the cage match, actually two weeks ago, but you guys didn't do a cage match last week, I'm assuming?
6147727	6147767	No.
6147787	6148808	Okay, so last time we did a cage match.
6149028	6153832	So by default, the winner from two weeks ago won last week, just by default, so there was no cage match.
6153873	6155474	So this is two weeks in a row now.
6156815	6159576	This is two weeks in a row now, going for its third victory.
6159616	6165138	And honestly, between you and me, I think this is going to be the first song that has to be retired after four weeks.
6165278	6172561	I just think it's going to... Just because it happens to be a host involved with the creation of it, I don't think it's ever going to lose.
6172681	6175582	But... Boost my ego some more.
6175962	6176442	That's enough.
6176982	6177643	You don't need no more.
6178143	6180744	But we have some worthy challengers tonight.
6180784	6181264	You know why?
6182429	6183710	This is what we decided to do.
6184030	6185451	I think Jamie did this too, right?
6185731	6187732	We let other people pick our songs this week.
6188852	6194535	Yep, so other people picked our songs for this week.
6194926	6195967	He was right, I like it.
6223985	6225427	Alright, let's get into the cage match.
6226048	6231175	Last week, two weeks ago's winner, this is Loki with the Legend of Trance.
6231396	6232617	We're just going to play a small clip of it.
6306602	6306822	ACID3PRO
6323527	6328009	I don't know, I don't know, I just want to make a remix or something, and I was like, yeah, I'll try that.
6328589	6329109	I want a sip.
6329209	6331570	I want a sip of it, because I haven't tried this yet.
6331690	6334151	Yeah, so I don't know, it's just, I thought about doing that.
6334291	6344374	I'm working on either, now I was trying to do a Dynamite Rave one, something like that, you know, something trancy, but it's just not, it's not very, it just doesn't work.
6344394	6345575	It's not sounding too good.
6346155	6348796	So I'm looking at right now, probably going to be doing a, um,
6350550	6354934	Dark Black Forest won, and there was another one I was looking at.
6355034	6357175	I can't remember.
6357196	6358917	Dark Black Forest was one of them, though, for sure.
6360398	6364081	Alright, next up, let's play my pick for this week.
6364161	6369966	However, my pick is actually coming from someone else this week, because I knew nothing I picked was going to beat Loki's.
6370566	6370966	Love of the Angel
6424352	6434694	I'm missing love, believe me I'll be someone Wish you love me, oh baby girl Why you ask me to fall in love with you Take me to the soul, to the soul of the angel Like a blind light in my mind Take me my life, to the top to feel alright
6486906	6487787	Thank you for watching!
6514761	6518544	Sorry about that, I was queuing up the second half of the interviews there.
6518564	6520465	Sorry about that.
6520645	6522666	Well, the interviews are all queued up now.
6522767	6523927	We'll get to that after the game.
6523947	6529251	Alright, that was KK, Jungle Girls, I don't remember their full name.
6530752	6531693	DJ Kong, thank you.
6532253	6533354	King Kong and Jungle Girls.
6533854	6534895	With Love of the Angels.
6535475	6536356	The Jungle Girls.
6537376	6539298	That wasn't a bad tune, I liked it.
6539318	6540839	Let's go around and see everybody else's thoughts.
6540859	6543421	Sorry, we had the music full volume there.
6543441	6543861	Sorry about that.
6544181	6545903	Let's go around and get everyone else's thoughts on that song.
6545983	6549946	80s fabulous, but not 80s fabulous enough.
6551627	6553769	I don't know, I give it like a 7.
6554129	6559753	It was pretty good for what it was supposed to sound like, but it wasn't nothing that really caught my attention.
6566215	6572662	I'd actually go ahead and give it an 8, because I think it would be a pretty decent DDR song.
6572783	6573924	It would be pretty cool in DDR.
6574544	6583134	And, you know, I have a feeling, just because there's some meanings behind this for some folks in the chatroom, there might be some votes coming this way for Love the Angels.
6583174	6584395	So, who knows?
6587092	6591516	I think they're trying everything they can to dethrone Legend of Trance.
6592016	6592737	Alright, oh.
6593458	6594539	Jamie's going to bring it.
6594779	6596700	Alright, Jamie, what are you bringing to the cage match tonight?
6597721	6602525	Alright, this was my favorite Belinda Carlyle song, Heaven is a Place on Earth.
6603266	6604947	This is a remix by Wild Side.
6606228	6609231	Alright, this is Wild Side with Heaven is a Place on Earth.
6609631	6612333	Jamie's pick for this week's cage match.
6612413	6612674	Enjoy.
6613800	6622875	Ooh, baby, do you know that's where Ooh, heaven is a place on earth This ain't heaven, love goes first We'll make heaven
6849516	6851822	Oh baby, do you know that's where Oh heaven is
6884950	6886752	All righty, that's the last pick.
6887993	6889655	Wild Side with Heaven is a Place on Earth.
6889695	6891116	Let's go around and get your thoughts on that.
6891156	6891456	Jamie!
6891717	6892017	Ten.
6893378	6894619	I give it a nine.
6896261	6898763	I just like speed mixes, so I will give it a seven.
6899344	6901366	But I have a DWI for it, so I give it a 7.5.
6904656	6905677	You know, that was pretty good.
6905717	6907379	I'm beginning to like Wildside a lot.
6907459	6912827	If you didn't recognize the name at first, they're the same band that did Irresistible from DDR Extreme.
6912847	6914189	They're pretty good.
6916291	6918835	Now, see, yeah, so they're getting some good stuff.
6920076	6921017	It was a pretty good mix.
6921057	6921497	I'll give it an 8.
6922077	6922218	8 for 80.
6923478	6923518	80s.
6924059	6925500	So, not too bad.
6926420	6927821	Alright, so here you go again.
6928161	6930082	You can start sending your votes now.
6930202	6933404	Send them over private message to Sky in the chatroom or over email.
6933785	6935486	Here, once again, are your choices.
6935586	6938427	Last week's winner, Legend of Trance by Loki.
6942930	6945171	Or you can vote for Love of the Angel.
6952492	6955674	Or you can vote for Wild Side with Heaven is a Place on Earth.
6963638	6966019	Alright, send those votes right now.
6966700	6966980	Alright.
6968461	6970042	Okay, so there you go.
6970982	6971843	But not the four with a rainbow.
6986832	6988573	Well, Wendell's through the whole damn thing.
6988633	6991756	If you listen to the special on Friday, Saturday, Wendell's in the whole damn thing.
6991836	6995058	So he didn't need a special interview.
6995338	6995959	Yeah, that was great.
6995999	6997660	I mean, hey, if you were... We were first.
6997780	7000722	Just goes to show, we stay on top of shit.
7000822	7007527	If you stay tuned into Orange Lounge and you're on the net, you're going to be the first to hear about all these news, especially when big tournaments are going on.
7008148	7009809	Because we got you covered.
7009989	7010450	We got you covered.
7010470	7010710	All right.
7011851	7012391	Here we go.
7012411	7013532	Second half of the interviews.
7014577	7019261	Alright, it's 5.47pm on Sunday, and they've just announced all the winners for freestyle.
7019621	7024705	Taking home Max 2 Machine, Bruce Leroy, and lots of great routines.
7024765	7026686	Honestly, any of these routines would have won a normal tournament.
7026706	7030429	I'm going to go around and see if I can't get some reaction from some folks.
7030990	7032371	We'll see what we can get here.
7035041	7038042	I'm standing here with JP Money, who came in, I believe, 7th place, right, with his routine?
7038443	7040844	Fabulous, fabulous ending to your routine, by the way, with all the money.
7040864	7041704	Where'd that idea come from?
7042064	7051248	Um, actually, that was brought to my attention by the minds of my, of my, uh, the people staying in the room, my roommates, there you go, that's what I was looking for.
7051268	7054129	And I, you know, I thought it was pretty clever, so I'm like, you know, why not?
7055030	7056330	So how did you feel about the tournament today?
7057031	7060172	Oh, man, everybody performed, performed really good.
7060412	7062473	I was, I'm really happy with the way it turned out.
7063249	7066592	and I'm happy that it ended on such a high note.
7066612	7068194	How are you going to celebrate today?
7069134	7069655	I don't know.
7069775	7071296	Me and my friends tonight are going to go somewhere.
7071957	7075980	We're going to hang, probably go crazy, just as we always do.
7076641	7077282	Alright, sounds good.
7077302	7077842	Thanks for talking to us.
7078242	7081085	Anything else you want to say?
7081245	7081765	No, not really.
7081906	7082206	Thank you.
7082506	7082886	Alright, cool.
7082906	7083007	Later.
7083147	7083327	Later.
7084369	7087030	All right, I'm staying here with the AJ Sweet Banana, who's taking home third place.
7087390	7088031	Awesome routine.
7088071	7089471	Definitely would have been in my top three, too.
7089691	7090451	How'd you feel about today?
7090992	7091332	Pretty good.
7091372	7095053	Not bad for a week's worth of procrastination, but yeah.
7095113	7100695	Everything, a lot of stuff here will be on eBay eventually, because I have a lot of it at home, but yeah.
7100976	7103196	It's okay, because it's cool, and I have Ikaruga.
7103497	7107298	How did you exactly, now you kind of crammed two really awesome freestyle routines.
7107318	7108599	How exactly did you go about cramming?
7108619	7109419	Were you up all night, or...
7109879	7113301	Uh, yeah, six hours of sleep, woke up early at Godin's house over here.
7114301	7116703	And, uh, yeah, practiced in his living room, that kind of thing.
7117463	7119784	I forgot a few things, you'll probably see them on videos, but that's fine.
7119844	7123386	It's all in the fun, it's all in the entertainment, it's all about the game, yeah.
7123646	7124307	What's next for you?
7124887	7132831	Uh, a break for college, maybe do something for B3, the coming up tournament, and, uh, yeah, focus on school because I've got a psych test tomorrow.
7133611	7136213	Oh, crap, that's the one you ought to have been cramming for, huh?
7136733	7140315	Yeah, and shout out to anyone who sees my iBook.
7140855	7144077	It has been stolen, and yeah, I lost my iBook here.
7144097	7147099	It's stolen from behind the pre-reg thing, but it's alright.
7147479	7148600	You know, I got something in return.
7148800	7149300	It's all good.
7150071	7152331	Yeah, alright, anything else you want to say to folks out there listening?
7152711	7155512	Uh, just, if you're playing the game, have fun, that's all there is to it.
7156172	7157852	Alright, thanks, have a good celebration tonight.
7158032	7158553	Alright, thanks.
7159553	7161373	Does anyone know if AJ found his iBook?
7161533	7166274	Let us know, we're curious, because that sucks to have stuff stolen.
7166414	7167134	Yeah, that's ass.
7167154	7167854	Bad people.
7168754	7169134	Naughty.
7171375	7173115	Alright, now we're talking to the winner.
7173555	7174795	Say hello to Bruce Leroy, everybody.
7175295	7176796	Hey everybody, what's going on?
7177516	7177996	How's it feel?
7178576	7179917	Man, it feels amazing.
7179957	7186782	I came out here and my first round was really kind of a disappointment for me.
7186862	7188463	I kind of choked a little bit.
7189464	7191925	I knew I just had to represent at this point.
7193963	7194864	I had faith in this routine.
7194884	7196405	Lookin' Up A Rock is a very fast song.
7196885	7199927	It required a lot of dedication.
7199967	7201308	It came through and it came together.
7201628	7204050	I didn't blank out like I did yesterday.
7205150	7207392	Thank God for that.
7207492	7208593	Everyone felt the moves.
7208673	7209373	That was the main part.
7210013	7210754	The crowd felt me.
7210794	7215437	That was the main thing that put me over the edge.
7215457	7218399	I filled the song, communicated with the song, and the song communicates through me.
7218419	7220120	That's how I try to do it.
7220260	7220500	Definitely.
7220540	7221000	I totally agree.
7221020	7223182	Was there anything you did to prepare for today's routine?
7223922	7227203	Um, definitely, um, I watched, um, Sammy Davis Jr.
7227223	7230204	was a tremendous influence, um, as was Fred Astaire and Gene Kelly.
7230584	7233305	Um, I watched a lot of their footage, like, Singing in the Rain, stuff like that.
7234005	7238427	Um, yeah, and then, you know, throwing in a bit of my own stuff, I really tried to feel the song, you know?
7238827	7244929	A lot of times people do routines, and they'll fight the song with their moves, and you gotta, you gotta let the song tell you what to do, so.
7245289	7247590	Another question on everybody's mind, what the hell are you gonna do with that machine?
7248740	7254503	I'm going to try my best to get it up to NorCal, put it in my apartment, and I'm telling you, one quarter for five songs, dude.
7254583	7255983	You live upstairs or downstairs?
7256003	7256623	I live upstairs.
7256824	7257344	Oh, shit.
7257664	7264086	And the maintenance man lives above me, so he's going to be pissed off.
7264147	7265147	That's right, dude.
7265187	7270069	After I do something, I'll have to put a cushion under it or something, dude, because it's going to drive him crazy.
7270249	7272510	Alright, well, congratulations.
7272550	7274651	Any other final thoughts going through your mind right now?
7274671	7274711	Um...
7277093	7278354	No, I thank everybody.
7278814	7283897	It's all about the people that love me and accept me for who I am and what I do and what I dance.
7284658	7287960	I'm just entirely grateful, dude.
7288480	7289481	Everybody loves Bruce Leroy.
7289501	7290221	Give me a hug, Bruce Leroy.
7290241	7291022	Give me a hug, baby.
7291062	7291922	All right, yeah.
7292523	7294944	Much love, yeah, yeah.
7297145	7298286	Oh, my God, yes.
7298446	7299467	All right, we'll be back.
7301973	7304897	All right, I'm sitting here with the Master42 who came in second place.
7305337	7306318	How do you feel about today's tournament?
7306639	7307540	Oh, it was so much fun.
7307600	7316370	I'm just so glad that I got to compete here with everybody and got a chance for everyone to see the skills and just to portray.
7317971	7319891	The event here is just so awesome.
7320271	7324012	Everybody's tournament and their performance is just really, really strong.
7324452	7326312	Now you decided to go a little OG with your routine.
7326352	7327433	How did you go about picking your song?
7327813	7337594	Well, I remember when I first started learning about freestyling, I downloaded videos off the internet and I saw this group, this Korean group called A-Team, and they performed to this song.
7337854	7340035	And I thought it was just the awesomest thing ever.
7340175	7341835	I was like, oh my gosh, that's incredible.
7341875	7343495	How did they do that?
7344196	7346836	You and Master42, DarkSakura, could be great friends.
7348016	7348757	Ah, classics.
7349677	7354620	I actually incorporated one of their moves from that video, and I've just loved that song ever since.
7354640	7356522	So what's going through your head right now?
7356542	7358043	What are you going to do with the prize?
7358563	7360724	I'm going to go home and play on it, dude.
7361985	7370951	I had an American version of the PlayStation, and I actually tried to bring American DDR steps to play here, but I learned at the last moment that they wouldn't actually work.
7371251	7373593	I needed a Japanese version of DDR.
7373753	7376735	So now I have that, so now for the next tournament, I won't be in that same pickle.
7377615	7378435	Alright, so what's next for you?
7378455	7379195	Are you going to be doing tournaments?
7379215	7379815	Are you going to take a break?
7379855	7380716	More tournaments in the future?
7380976	7385516	Yeah, I heard there's a tournament coming up in July that has a freestyle aspect, so I'm going to check that out.
7385856	7389297	I don't think it'll be as big as CyberZone, but it'll be something to look forward to.
7389617	7389957	Sounds good.
7389977	7392058	And how are you celebrating tonight?
7392778	7399099	We speculate, by the way, that July tournament that Master42 references could possibly be actually a really big tournament.
7399599	7402399	I think March Madness is going to be a qualifier.
7402739	7404820	Yeah, this might be a big deal.
7405120	7406620	More details to come on that one.
7407463	7409725	Guys, we're going down to Roscoe's for chicken and waffles.
7409865	7410686	Roscoe's!
7410726	7413107	Yeah, that's right, that's right!
7413168	7416010	We want, we want Roscoe's!
7416710	7417171	Yeah!
7417691	7420053	So I think we're going to head down there for some chicken and waffles.
7420353	7422615	Alright, anything else you want to say to the fine folks listening?
7422635	7425457	Just congratulations to everyone, and take up DDR.
7425597	7428439	You might feel funky at first, but it's the best game in the world, man.
7428520	7429961	It gets you laid like you can't believe.
7430001	7430961	Yeah, totally, man.
7431542	7432202	It does?
7432563	7433483	What the hell am I doing wrong?
7435723	7436564	Alright, thanks for talking to us.
7436704	7437564	Alright, thanks a lot, man.
7438405	7438845	Fucked up.
7439686	7442989	And he forgot to have the third place match.
7443009	7447512	Whoa, that went into Fremont interviews because I used the same tape there.
7448073	7449213	Alright, that was it.
7449274	7451996	That was all the interviews that we did that night.
7452596	7454658	And then right after that, we headed over to Roscoe's.
7455018	7462644	And in the special, you're going to actually hear some stuff taped at Roscoe's, including you'll hear the waiter was in on their...
7463004	7465805	and I believe, I don't remember if I got Wendell's speech or not.
7465825	7470147	Wendell, we did a shot, we did maple syrup shots, basically.
7471268	7473589	Us at our table, we did shots because the waiter gave us the idea.
7473609	7475750	He was talking about crazy customers that did shots of it.
7476030	7477611	We all did a shot and did a toast.
7477911	7478751	It was a beautiful moment.
7478871	7480172	Roscoe's was actually one of the highlights.
7480192	7482053	Did it make you choke?
7482093	7486715	No, it tasted like... Actually...
7487616	7488677	The hell with the tournament!
7501118	7502259	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7521816	7522357	Very cool.
7522457	7523017	That was cool.
7523077	7524378	And all the white faces.
7524438	7526320	We literally took over like half of Roscoe's.
7526360	7537509	We had all the people, because this was a Sunday night, we had all the people on the one side coming back from church, coming to get their grits and their greens, and then they had us, just crazy kids there.
7538870	7539731	Are we going to go to a break?
7541448	7545714	We're going to go to a break, and when we come back, we'll announce the winner of this week's cage match.
7546575	7550200	And, yeah, won't that be exciting?
7551822	7554786	Loki, say something to stretch time here while I load up something for the break.
7555467	7556128	Say something.
7556485	7556986	Yeah, something.
7558408	7559048	Your mom.
7560590	7563975	Alright, we'll play the song that won the tournament.
7564295	7566638	Bruce Leroy used this song for his routine at Rules.
7568040	7569241	Great, great routine.
7569261	7570603	Manika Niko Rock.
7570663	7570903	Enjoy.
7841428	7846270	Alright, if you didn't recognize those, those were the top three freestyle songs right there.
7846391	7850613	First place was Manic Ningo Rock, second place was Brilliant to Your Orchestral Groove, and third place was Let's Get Down.
7850653	7853894	Those were the songs that the folks did their routines to in one cyberbeat.
7853914	7855535	Okay, we're going to take things in a different direction now.
7855555	7858136	We're going to play a song from Dance Mania EX2.
7858176	7860998	This is an interesting trance cover of your song.
7861378	7862519	Let us know what you think of this.
7862539	7863079	This is interesting.
7863359	7867661	When we come back, we're going to announce the winner of the cage match and this week's list list.
7868201	7869202	It's going to be cool.
7899447	7900071	Thanks for watching!
8132386	8137190	From StepSquad to Orange Labs, this PDR sucks!
8137551	8137871	Holla!
8137891	8138091	P.S.
8138111	8138532	TTPO
8147442	8154893	Alright, that was Obsession from Dance Mania EX2 with your song.
8154913	8157577	And I think Jamie just about vomited during that.
8158638	8159319	I tried to ignore it.
8159359	8159960	I blocked it out.
8161262	8162784	We were looking at my afterburner.
8163084	8165004	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8190322	8190782	Hey!
8192043	8192683	My foot wins.
8192823	8198106	Now, you guys, I have to admit, I think a lot of you... We got way less votes than we usually do this week.
8198126	8199107	I think just zero wins.
8199127	8199767	I vote for zero.
8199827	8200508	We vote for zero.
8200808	8205690	I got way less votes than I usually do for Cage Match, but you know, it just happens sometimes.
8205911	8208652	And I begged, I pleaded, but we got all the votes.
8208772	8210433	I didn't even pay attention to you adding them up.
8210933	8215816	And so, yeah, I know this is actually going to be a surprise to everyone, but folks, we added up the votes.
8216176	8216857	And the winner...
8217937	8219538	is a little bit surprising.
8220658	8225479	The winner, you guys, is Wild Side with Heaven is a Place on Earth.
8226060	8229101	I love all of you.
8230481	8233002	I love all of you.
8233262	8243305	I'd like to dedicate this victory to all the little people that stepped on all the waves.
8243385	8244145	That's the winner.
8245166	8246446	I begged for votes.
8249076	8251078	Alright, so it was a close one, though.
8251699	8255943	And, uh, funny enough, Loki, Loki, I thought it was gonna be the whole month.
8256383	8258205	You came in dead last in that vote.
8258225	8258886	Sorry.
8258946	8260828	There's only seven people that voted.
8262249	8263170	Where is everybody?
8263551	8264431	That's what I wanna know.
8265913	8267134	Don't know, don't know what to tell ya.
8267414	8270598	Alright, so, uh, but Loki, you know what that means?
8271418	8272880	That means you just gotta go make another remix.
8275009	8276750	I don't know what I was going to do anyways.
8276891	8279874	You should do a 5-1-1 speed mix.
8281236	8281556	Uh, no.
8284720	8285761	Alright, there it is.
8285921	8286822	Winner of the cage match.
8287262	8288844	Wild side, heaven has placed on earth.
8288944	8289305	Okay.
8290777	8293059	Now we're going to do a segment on this show, you know it, you love it.
8293099	8298984	We do it damn near every week, but god damn it, it's just so popular, so much fun to do, we're doing it again.
8300866	8302307	Listless, ladies and gentlemen.
8302848	8306551	Tonight's topic... Loki, tell us the topic for tonight.
8307692	8309834	It's the best 8-bit Nintendo game.
8310975	8311996	Yay!
8312016	8313117	Squee!
8313137	8315699	Remember, this is NES, not Game Boy.
8316838	8317779	Yes, NES only.
8317799	8319279	8-bit Nintendo games only.
8319459	8319739	Okay.
8319940	8325622	Since every serious gamer knows the Nintendo was the only system that mattered and still does matter.
8327543	8328223	I beg to differ.
8328263	8330004	The Sega Master System was pretty fabulous.
8330044	8331085	It had some of the best games.
8332465	8333466	We were both saying this.
8333506	8335867	They had the best version of Fantasy Zone.
8336556	8343202	Fantasy Zone, if you have never played it, emulate it, find somebody who has it, and just sit in front of the TV for an hour and play it, and you'll love it.
8343642	8346965	And if you've ever played Samba de Amigo, it has the Opa Opa song.
8350528	8358875	Well, no, but also, for anyone who's ever seen my quote on my banner on DDR Freak and the one I used to have on Sack of Remani, it's, welcome to the Fantasy Zone.
8359015	8360316	Get ready.
8360516	8361577	We all know what game that came from.
8362258	8362738	Um...
8367455	8371560	Space Harrier, because Space Harrier was in the Fantasy Zone, as in from the old game.
8371940	8374683	Oh my gosh, I forgot about that, because I haven't played that game in so long.
8374823	8377446	Why else do you think the whole game was pastel with a checkered floor?
8378668	8378888	Okay.
8380313	8381134	Alright, here we go.
8381174	8382535	Who's going to start us off tonight?
8383216	8383416	You.
8384017	8384277	Me?
8384537	8385178	Alright, I'll start.
8386019	8394327	My pick for best 8-bit Nintendo game ever is a little weird, but you've got to represent, you've got to know your roots.
8394508	8395589	You have to know your roots.
8396310	8400414	My number three pick for best Nintendo game ever is Dance Aerobics.
8401738	8402118	Freak.
8403199	8406400	You know, when you said going back to your roots, I was thinking that you were going to start playing RuPaul.
8406840	8407000	No.
8408120	8409121	You better work.
8409481	8410181	Cover girl.
8411342	8411502	No.
8411642	8413002	RuPaul did a song called Back to My Roots.
8413262	8413622	Oh, really?
8413783	8414583	About getting hairdressed.
8414983	8415243	Oh, no.
8415283	8416904	I only know the Supermodel song.
8416924	8417884	Sorry.
8417964	8422506	Dance Aerobics is my number three pick simply because DDR is a complete ripoff of Dance Aerobics.
8424750	8426251	I have one pick.
8426271	8432337	My number three pick... Now keep in mind it only came out in Japan, but because it was on the Famicom it counts.
8432357	8432797	Kid Dracula!
8432817	8438502	And you can download the emulator in the ROM!
8452813	8454675	Kid Dracula is Jamie's number three pick.
8457239	8457719	Zero.
8458200	8459982	Like, my number three was Hogan's Alley.
8461183	8461984	Hogan's Alley.
8462705	8470074	That was the first game where you could actually shoot innocent people if you got really bored of trying to shoot the little spinny flipping board evil guys.
8472200	8472680	Oh, Huzz?
8473601	8474561	That is so cool, though.
8474761	8482345	Hogan's Alley, and already the chatroom is going crazy saying all these games have to be mentioned, and I already know none of them are gonna get mentioned.
8483105	8485526	Just because our picks are off the wall, I know these people.
8485566	8487047	We gotta go back to our roots here.
8487067	8487627	Uh-oh.
8488048	8492350	Okay, we're going with the best all-time fucking game ever, Contra.
8493270	8494110	Contra!
8496592	8499493	But no way, the Japanese version was better because the trees moved.
8501092	8501492	I hate you.
8501532	8506715	That was my number two pick.
8527686	8528287	was it really?
8528708	8535341	uh oh alright Mega Man 2 was my second favorite but you can take a suggestion from the chat room there's plenty of suggestions if you want to see that
8539565	8541107	Alright, then Mega Man 2.
8541647	8546992	The reason why I say Mega Man 2 and not Mega Man 1, just because I think the series... Mega Man 2 was the top of the series.
8547393	8549114	Mega Man 2 was when it really started to take off.
8549174	8553879	That's really the one that everybody, you know, all the other Mega Mans were a rip-off of, was Mega Man 2.
8553919	8554680	Two words.
8555380	8555901	Two words.
8556161	8556702	Big shades.
8556722	8557482	Metal blades.
8557783	8558523	Metal blades.
8559765	8561747	Alright, Mega Man 2 is my number two pick.
8562027	8563048	Jamie, what's your number two pick?
8564474	8567535	I would shoot myself if I didn't mention it since you took my number two favorite.
8568055	8568615	Legend of Zelda.
8569515	8572076	Alright, going to just what you know, The Legend of Zelda.
8572096	8575217	It's a very popular game.
8576037	8576957	Because I hated Zelda 2.
8578797	8581438	You know, a lot of the chat room would agree with you with it.
8581798	8582078	Really.
8582538	8583258	I like Zelda 2.
8583478	8584159	I appreciate Zelda 2.
8584199	8588980	Zelda 2 is more like playing an RPG, but The Legend of Zelda was just like, oh my god.
8589540	8593861	You know, and I would actually have almost mentioned Metroid, except I suck at Metroid, so Zelda.
8594716	8597678	And you know, I like Zelda 2 a lot.
8597698	8599660	What's funny is that Nintendo sequels kind of did that.
8599680	8600620	You had Mario Bros.
8600841	8602262	2, it was completely different than Mario Bros.
8602282	8602262	1.
8602302	8604203	Zelda 2 wasn't even a Mario game.
8604223	8605464	I know, I know it wasn't a Mario game.
8605484	8608326	Zelda 2, okay, his sword was like a little dagger.
8609047	8610528	It was like, it was pathetic.
8610968	8612169	Pathetic dagger.
8612749	8614952	I mean, I think he's like, I'm Polkino with the dagger!
8615192	8616013	Polkino with the dagger!
8616073	8622560	Although I did like that in Super Smash Bros., they gave him his Zelda 2 moves, which made more sense for a fighting game.
8623281	8626324	Dude, in Zelda 2, his sword looked like a penis.
8626344	8627545	Yeah!
8628266	8630869	My number two, it wasn't really popular, but Arkanoid
8648049	8648829	Arkanoid!
8649650	8652212	Yeah, Breakout also.
8652612	8658877	It was the most redundant game in the world, and you got really pissed off when you couldn't pass the third level and had to start all over again.
8658897	8662700	Yeah, but at least the Nintendo one was a little more colorful, though.
8662720	8663920	That's what's best in Out of the Clean Area.
8675225	8676585	I'm a master on Destructo Match now.
8676645	8677746	Anyway, we'll talk Neopets later.
8678846	8682246	I want to talk about Waste of Time websites at the end of the show, because we have some new ones coming up this week.
8683247	8684927	Time to bring out the big guns.
8685487	8687287	Castlevania 2, Simon's Quest.
8687567	8688047	Excellent.
8688507	8688868	Excellent.
8688888	8692988	The only Castlevania... No, not the only Castlevania matters, because we have the whole Dracula X series.
8693528	8697689	Simon was the hero of all the Belmonts and the non-Belmonts.
8698049	8703290	You know what just pissed me off is the fact that with the Captain N cartoon, they made Simon Belmont into this pretentious asshole.
8706910	8718317	Don't let me forget to get you a ROM of Konami World for the Famicom, because there's a Castlevania 2 level in it.
8720298	8724120	The Konami World games are winner, but they're too obscure for anyone to know anything about.
8727935	8728616	All right, moving on.
8728676	8730179	Okay, now we got the number one choice.
8730659	8735427	My number one choice for greatest 8-bit Nintendo game ever, Blaster Master.
8737670	8739192	We all know the grenade trick, don't we?
8740414	8741196	Absolutely.
8741954	8744617	The sequels to Blaster Master, they don't exist to me.
8744657	8745458	They are ass.
8745999	8750825	Somebody needs to make a really good sequel to Blaster Master that plays just like the original.
8751025	8752768	That game was the shit.
8752968	8753428	The end.
8754410	8756212	Although it technically... We know who should do it.
8756712	8757213	Treasure.
8757954	8759416	And they should do it like the way they did Bungaio.
8759918	8760938	I have no idea what that is.
8761779	8762699	You don't know what Treasure is?
8762939	8763559	I've never played it.
8763620	8767061	Treasure is the best video game manufacturing group ever.
8767541	8768762	They did Gunstar Heroes.
8769422	8769722	Oh, okay.
8769902	8771823	They did Radiant Silvergun.
8772283	8772983	Oh, okay, yeah, okay.
8773003	8775004	Oh, you should have just said the people that did Radiant Silvergun.
8775024	8775504	I don't know.
8775884	8776405	Treasure.
8776885	8777485	Treasure.
8777785	8778445	Yeah, no, whoosh.
8778666	8778906	Oh, well.
8779146	8788930	Okay, but technically, actually, I just have to say is that my number one would really be the same thing that Jamie's putting for her number one, but I already knew she was going to put it, so I didn't have to, so I said something else.
8789270	8789510	All right.
8790441	8791862	Guardian Legend, fuck yeah.
8791902	8793202	The Guardian Legend!
8793803	8794803	Best game ever.
8796044	8802407	Tonight was like my first time seeing that game, and I saw like five minutes of it, and I think it was one of the coolest games ever.
8802807	8804889	A lot of people don't know about the Guardian Legend.
8804929	8805849	Tell Jamie, Jamie, tell them.
8805889	8806870	It has Lola Lala Lala in it.
8806970	8809251	I know, but tell them about the Guardian Legend, how it works.
8809271	8813333	Guardian Legend is a combination shooting game, adventure game.
8815014	8816955	Like, yeah, shooting, oh god.
8817515	8818736	If you thought R-Type was hard...
8820774	8821555	Thanks for watching!
8837956	8852001	Guardian Legend, you know, you start off flying your way into this planet, and the planet is this whole mechanized planet, and then you run around, and by the way, it's a girl, which is cool, and you run around, and you shoot things, and you find weapons, and you go, you actually gain levels.
8852601	8854081	You find ships, and you gain levels.
8854141	8857623	The more things you kill, the higher levels you get, so it has the RPG element in it, too.
8858303	8862844	And by the way, you find little shops with these blue aliens, and it's Lolo and Lala from Adventures of Lolo.
8864465	8865045	And, you know,
8865754	8876639	And then, you know, you find these little levels, and the way that the levels are set up, you have your entry level, which is level 0, then you have 1, 10, 2, 20, or, you know, like that.
8876879	8878119	It was 1, 11, didn't it?
8878139	8878379	It wasn't 11, 12?
8878960	8879480	Yeah, it was 1, 11.
8880500	8880640	It was 1, 11.
8881201	8882381	Because when you get to level 10, it's 10, 20.
8883842	8886763	Which were, by the way, the freaking hardest levels in the universe.
8887964	8888404	Awesome game.
8888444	8891185	I have beaten that game all of once.
8893001	8893642	Beautiful game.
8893882	8895985	I can beat the last level of the game.
8896465	8897747	I can breeze my way through.
8898227	8902593	Because once you get the backfire weapon, you just sit in a corner and shoot it with the backfire weapon.
8903024	8910205	And by the way, your game counselor tip of the day, use TGL as your password to bypass the Zelda-ish part of the game.
8910225	8912446	It also had an unbreakable password system.
8914126	8916447	Trust me, no one has been able to break this password system.
8916767	8922728	You know, I could figure out all the Mega Man ones, like, you know, no problem, but no one can break the Guardian Legends password system.
8923048	8927789	But if you put in TGL, you can bypass all the adventure levels, and you play it just like a shooter.
8928249	8931890	In between levels, you get your special weapons and what you normally would have gotten if you keep going on.
8932478	8932758	All right.
8934159	8935459	Enough about whoring out that boy.
8935500	8936660	We spent a lot of time on that one.
8937060	8938621	It's obvious we're a little biased here.
8938661	8938921	Sorry.
8939301	8941322	Zero, what's your number one pick?
8941482	8945464	Okay, my number one pick was Super Mario Bros.
8945484	8945464	3.
8945544	8948606	Because it was, I don't know, it was just like the best one.
8948646	8953608	It almost seemed like it was kind of ahead of its time when it came to getting all the different suits and stuff.
8953788	8957810	And plus, the first time anyone ever saw it was in the greatest movie ever.
8957830	8958271	Yeah.
8959732	8960412	and The Wizard.
8961193	8963736	The Wizard is the coolest movie in history.
8963836	8965517	If you haven't seen it, go buy it.
8966999	8967720	The Power Glove.
8967800	8968460	It's so bad.
8968520	8969421	Go rent it.
8969741	8971423	Get your Power Glove off her.
8972124	8973045	Yeah, what was the point?
8973065	8973805	Have a Power Glove.
8973966	8975407	I don't even think it was that useful.
8976008	8978570	I think he used it for like two things and that was it.
8981761	8986965	I want the left hand and the right hand one, so I could do, like, try to figure out how to weak punch out to it.
8987326	8988306	That would be so cool, isn't it?
8988407	8990128	Or the, you can use, remember the U-Force?
8990308	8991209	Yeah.
8991229	8994852	That thing, all you could use it on was, like, Rad Racer, and that was it.
8996033	8996974	It was pretty retarded.
8998195	9005681	You should wire two power gloves, okay, wire it to, like, you know, the DDR type thing, and just play DDR with your hands.
9007913	9015442	Yeah, well, the one problem is the left-handed Power Glove is so, like, unbelievably rare that if you find one, you can easily sell it on eBay for $100.
9015482	9022049	People are, like, I've seen the Power Glove on eBay already for a couple, for, like, $500.
9022289	9024031	They're just a right.
9025193	9026915	For, like, $500, you can't find them anywhere.
9028248	9033051	You should... You should check on your fans what they're doing for you.
9033571	9034892	I do indeed have two Power Gloves.
9035192	9036613	Alright, uh, my pick.
9036633	9037913	There's like tons of choices.
9038614	9039774	Tons of choices.
9040695	9043136	Um... Get your Power Glove off her!
9044637	9046958	Well, you know, it's kind of an... Ah!
9047018	9047999	He touched my breast!
9052801	9053602	That was great.
9054162	9054842	Oh, man.
9055022	9055823	Did Drew touch your breast?
9055883	9055963	No.
9057830	9065873	One of my favorite games on the Nintendo had to have been... I don't know, I go back and play it now and it's just like, okay, whatever.
9066614	9069055	Bionic Commando.
9070395	9071816	Do you ever read Old Schooled?
9073136	9080579	The guy from Bionic Commando hangs out in the bar with all the other Nintendo characters and he's like their hero because his bionic arm can reach out and grab beer from across the hall.
9085061	9085801	Anything else you want to...
9087166	9107311	That game was cool because you didn't have an arm, you had this giant claw thing that grabbed on stuff, and you couldn't jump because I guess the arm weighed too much, and there's these guys that looked all the same, but they were different shades of color, but they were different people, and stuff happened, and if you got caught by the people, then more people came.
9107371	9108732	And it had the best ending.
9108872	9109632	You blew up Hitler.
9110472	9111412	Yeah, and you blew up Hitler.
9115276	9117401	The fact, also, you could choose your path, too.
9118043	9123675	And, like, you could say, I want to go this way, to, like, B or K, and then bounce all around, and it's pretty fun.
9125290	9127511	You said BK, and I started thinking of British Nights.
9127951	9129052	I started thinking of Burger King.
9129512	9130052	Hold on!
9131453	9137636	I gotta, I'm sorry, you know, I like Bionic Commando, but there's just something that just got flashing in my mind.
9138117	9141578	One of the best games ever, and I need to change mine.
9141778	9142219	I'm sorry.
9142419	9144060	You wanna change that one, or you wanna change one of your other ones?
9144700	9146261	You wanna change Contra, Castlevania II?
9146841	9147521	Change Contra.
9148282	9148962	Oh, okay.
9152304	9154145	Alright, what are we putting on instead of Contra, then?
9155526	9158109	You know, this might be a bad decision, but Marble Madness.
9158709	9159971	Marble Madness!
9167899	9172104	Best game ever, and I wish they'd make it on a new system, but they haven't yet.
9174218	9181684	It's on the Atari collection for the, um, or no, the Midway collection for, uh, PlayStation, and you can actually get the PlayStation track while we got one.
9182064	9184607	I can't believe he just took off Contra to put in Marble Madness.
9185007	9187709	Alright, let's read the list.
9188269	9188810	Here we go.
9189230	9200259	The list so far, Dancer Aerobics, Kid Dracula, Hogan's Alley, Marble Madness, Mega Man 2, The Legend of Zelda, Arknoid, Castlevania II, Simon's Quest, Blaster Master, The Guardian Legends, Super Mario Bros.
9200559	9201180	3, and Bionic.
9202301	9207243	Now let's go through those glaring omissions according to our chat room that we left off of the list.
9207263	9208384	I know they're going to say Metroid.
9208824	9210365	Metroid, the most obvious.
9210485	9211686	Metal Gear.
9211946	9212846	Nobody said Metal Gear.
9213987	9215028	Final Fantasy.
9216068	9216889	Adventure Island.
9218069	9218810	RoboCop.
9221991	9223212	Gyro Mike, come on.
9224013	9224773	Burger Time.
9224833	9226694	You can squash the professor, that's a good point.
9227895	9228776	Dragon Warrior.
9229036	9229296	Yeah.
9230317	9230757	Dragon Warrior 4.
9230797	9231778	Just because it had a slime.
9232258	9233659	Bubble Bobble.
9234159	9238822	Bubble Bobble is a kick-ass game, however the NES translation just was not the same as the arcade.
9239022	9244566	If we were talking about like best 80s arcade game maybe, I'd put Bubble Bobble on there, but not for best Nintendo game.
9244606	9245266	Kickle Cubicle.
9245527	9246687	Kickle Cubicle was pretty cool.
9247248	9248689	And, and, and, Fantasy Zone.
9249669	9257855	Kid Icarus, Ice Climber, Battletoads, River City Ransom, Double Dragon Star Tropics, Mario Tennis Don't mention any stupid Virtual Boy games because they all give me a headache.
9273945	9275126	I'm just kind of scrambling lists.
9275206	9278267	Oh, and then last, we have Adventures of Lolo.
9278727	9279988	Hey, I mentioned it.
9280208	9282169	I have bad memory.
9282189	9286752	No, I'm just kidding.
9286932	9287592	Clu Clu Land.
9287872	9289413	I have psychological damage every time.
9289533	9289953	No, I'm kidding.
9289973	9292094	I can play Clu Clu Land on Animal Crossing.
9292374	9293635	I can play Balloon Fight on Animal Crossing.
9293875	9295216	Kid Icarus, did I say that already?
9295296	9295456	Yes.
9295476	9296937	Kid Icarus, Mike Tyson's Punch Out.
9296957	9300859	Remember, here's your other pro tip of the day for Kid Icarus.
9300979	9302740	It's Icarus fights Medusa Angels.
9303360	9307041	When I find a place to upload it, I'm going to upload my DWI to the Mike Tyson's Punch-Out!!
9307061	9307261	remix.
9307281	9311922	There's like urbic DWI to it, it took me like 30 minutes, but it was really good.
9331799	9334981	And it has the instruction manual as the background.
9336721	9337242	That's great.
9338362	9338862	Alrighty.
9339823	9341684	Okay, so now we gotta vote stuff off.
9341724	9344125	This is gonna be very difficult tonight, you guys.
9344465	9345646	It's gonna be very difficult.
9346706	9347907	I guess I have to start, huh?
9348087	9348287	Yeah.
9350128	9352008	Uh, well, you're all going to hate me.
9352068	9353229	I'm taking off Marble Madness.
9354609	9356729	The reason why, no, I have good justification.
9357129	9359170	Because Marble Madness was way too short.
9359670	9360790	It was only six levels.
9360950	9362630	The thrill was gone in a day.
9364291	9366491	I just can't, nah, I can't let it be there.
9366511	9368952	Marble Madness is really only worthy to play if you have the trackball.
9370332	9376173	Which is why I was very lucky to hit Toys R Us when they were clearing out their trackballs for like 75% off for the PlayStation.
9377623	9392433	Me, Dance Aerobics Because I sprained my ankle playing that game I have painful memories of Dance Aerobics This sucks, because the two obvious ones are gone now
9394494	9397375	I will take off my own, Hogan's Alley.
9398655	9402396	It was fun, but it's not one of the very best games ever.
9402656	9408057	Amazingly enough, first time in the history of this show, if I'm not mistaken, somebody took their own item off the list.
9408837	9409038	No.
9409278	9409378	No?
9409478	9410818	We did Listless last week.
9411338	9412558	Oh, did you all do that or something?
9412718	9416439	I forgot what we did it about, but everybody but me took off Best Liquor.
9416719	9418080	Oh, God, you guys.
9418540	9421641	Everybody but me took off one of their own.
9422001	9423041	I stand corrected.
9423821	9426122	One thing I can't believe we all forgot was Excitebike.
9426742	9429964	Even though it was short, even though it was short, it was still a classic.
9430024	9432965	Excitebike was awesome, but it badly needed an update.
9433245	9436887	Well, I guess some say that Uniracers is supposed to be a sequel to Excitebike.
9437147	9438068	I don't buy that.
9438368	9440989	And the 64 version was absolutely horrible.
9441289	9442089	I never played that.
9442149	9442550	Oh, God.
9442570	9442950	It was stupid.
9445413	9446474	Oh, well.
9446594	9447074	Actually, no.
9447094	9447854	There was one on Game Boy.
9447874	9450535	I think it was Motocross Maniacs or something that played kind of similar.
9451516	9452016	But it was ass.
9452456	9452756	All right.
9453777	9454877	Loki, last one coming off.
9454917	9455237	What is it?
9458279	9461960	Just Arkanoid because I don't like that game.
9463141	9463521	All right.
9463601	9464762	Arkanoid comes off the list.
9465682	9471405	It was either there or Kid Dracula because Kid Dracula just reminds me of that stupid little vampire movie.
9471805	9473746	Thank God I hate that little vampire movie.
9480342	9481403	Jamie's going to make him play now.
9481783	9485365	All right, here we go.
9485585	9486265	This is the list.
9487246	9488826	Send in your votes right now.
9488926	9495450	Kid Dracula, Mega Man 2, The Legend of Zelda, Castlevania II, Simon's Quest, Blaster Master.
9495470	9495890	I read those.
9496811	9497331	Oh, okay.
9497711	9497991	Sorry.
9498251	9498712	I read those.
9498752	9500553	You were too busy getting mad at Loki.
9500633	9501733	All right, then start from the top.
9502053	9503374	Hold on, I'm going to post this in the chat room.
9504875	9505815	All right, start from the top.
9505895	9506896	Best 8-bit game ever.
9507284	9515670	Kid Dracula, Mega Man 2, The Legend of Zelda, Castlevania 2, Simon's Quest, Blaster Master, The Guardian Legend, Super Mario Bros.
9515930	9516850	3, and Bionic Commando.
9518531	9521954	Alright, send in your votes right freaking now.
9524495	9525996	In the meantime, we're going to take a quick break.
9526016	9526557	We'll be back.
9526657	9532821	We've got some brief announcements and reminders, a message, and other things.
9535177	9546690	Yeah, more people need to vote than voted on the cage match, because you guys got a surprise thing in there, because nobody voted on cage match, so y'all better be voting for listless.
9547090	9550534	Okay, we'll be right back after we hear this 8th style song that makes me wet.
9550734	9551115	Just kidding.
9551876	9551996	Okay.
9619895	9620702	Thanks for watching!
9674361	9675542	Thank you for watching!
9716273	9717183	Thanks for watching!
9772552	9773313	Thanks for watching!
9857734	9861895	Let's listen in on an Orange Lounge Radio staff meeting.
9862115	9863836	Do you want to be accepted by Hollywood?
9863876	9864236	No!
9864356	9867997	Do we care what people think of us?
9868617	9870478	No!
9870498	9871938	Do we want people to kiss our ass?
9872379	9872599	Yes!
9876477	9878318	Extreme Bomani Radio.
9878558	9881400	That's us, Orange Lounge Radio.
9881980	9882620	We're back.
9883401	9885842	Wrapping up episode number 34 here in this final segment.
9887303	9888123	I heard a funny joke.
9888343	9889844	Irene and Brad told me a funny joke today.
9890664	9893646	I thought we'd have joke time on Orange Lounge Radio.
9893686	9894106	So here we go.
9894687	9895347	Knock, knock.
9896187	9896848	Interrupting cow.
9901440	9903460	That's like totally from South Park.
9904261	9904821	Is it really?
9904981	9908241	Yeah, it's from... The other retarded kid, I forget his name.
9908261	9909262	I still like the muffin joke.
9909642	9910222	Damn it!
9910942	9915223	I didn't know that was from South because I stopped watching South Park because I didn't even know they were making new ones anymore.
9915903	9916263	Damn.
9916663	9918224	Oh, you want me to tell the muffin joke?
9918304	9918824	I want to tell it.
9919324	9919624	Alright.
9920104	9920924	You remember the muffin joke?
9920984	9921884	Have you heard the muffin joke?
9922285	9922885	Okay.
9922905	9923665	I'll give Ryan the other mic.
9923705	9924265	Alright.
9926998	9928501	Two muffins are baking in the oven.
9929182	9932068	And one of the other muffins goes, Oh my god, we're cooking, we're burning!
9932188	9933471	The other one goes, Oh shit, a talking muffin.
9934954	9935475	Oh my god.
9938584	9939044	Yeah.
9940385	9941545	Thank you, Irene.
9942186	9942566	Alright.
9943687	9946708	I feel stupid now that I know that joke came from South Park, Jesus Christ.
9946728	9949730	You wanna talk about a stupid joke, but it was kinda, it was funny the way it was said?
9949950	9952091	Has anybody seen Catch Me If You Can?
9952691	9952851	No.
9953031	9957213	There's a part where Tom Hanks is sitting there with a bunch of other FBI agents, and he's all, why don't you tell a joke?
9957393	9960455	And he's all, okay, he's all, knock knock, and all, who's there?
9960475	9961395	And he goes, go fuck yourself.
9961916	9962596	And that was the end of the joke.
9965826	9966167	Right.
9966247	9967148	You know what was a joke?
9967188	9969510	Those pictures of the person playing DDR just as Sakura.
9970751	9971211	That was cute.
9971431	9972172	That was cute.
9972372	9973393	That was a cute routine.
9973653	9973914	Yeah.
9973934	9974674	That was good costume.
9974694	9975695	Yeah, it was cool.
9976236	9976896	It wasn't a joke.
9976977	9978298	It was serious time, man.
9979022	9979442	CyberBeat Special
10009042	10023365	I'm not hooked on it I'm not hooked on it Alright, here we go Number 3, by your vote, listless, here it is Number 3, best 8-bit game ever, drumroll Is Super Mario Bros.
10023385	10028707	3 Or as the guy in the wizard said, Super Mario Bros.
10028727	10029727	3 Okay
10037859	10040700	Number two, best Nintendo game ever.
10040800	10041540	Did you give a drum roll?
10042180	10042381	Yes.
10044001	10048703	The Legend of Zelda.
10049083	10057146	Alright, and the best Nintendo game ever, as voted by you guys, Mega Man 2 is the winner.
10057226	10061547	Mega Man 2 is the best Nintendo game ever, according to the chat room.
10064108	10064368	Alright.
10066590	10068391	Guardian Legend didn't get a single vote.
10068431	10069532	How the hell did that happen?
10070193	10072775	It's mostly because people play all the mainstream games.
10073255	10074936	Like Blaster Master is mainstream as it was.
10074956	10079760	See, that's why I was surprised because I didn't think anybody in here was going to end up putting a mainstream.
10079900	10083142	When I was listening to the number three choices, I'm like, nobody's going to put a mainstream game on here.
10083182	10084683	And then all of a sudden the number ones were all mainstream.
10085024	10087806	I wasn't going to put a bunch of other ones.
10088286	10090588	But no one really played Arkanoid or Hogan's Alley.
10090668	10091509	I played Arkanoid.
10091569	10092769	It just was an arcade game.
10093030	10093770	And I played Hogan's Alley.
10093810	10095792	All you bitches need to go play Guardian Legend.
10096598	10097958	It's all about bad dudes.
10098939	10099959	Oh, jeez.
10100379	10102980	What was the one which had, like, a fat lady as a boss?
10103780	10104760	Was that Rampage?
10104800	10105520	Or not Rampage?
10105580	10105900	Renegade.
10105940	10106700	No, no, no, no, no, no.
10106720	10107200	Best game ever.
10107281	10107881	Super Dodgeball.
10110081	10111822	It was one of the two of your games.
10112482	10115102	Ikari Warriors, because it always glitched out when we played it.
10115282	10119563	We used to get dust on the game just to see how badly it'd glitch out.
10119963	10120824	It was awesome.
10121164	10123004	No, it was all about pro wrestling.
10123244	10125785	The one where you had, like, one kick and one punch.
10126085	10126285	Yeah.
10127330	10127670	All right.
10128291	10131573	Oh, we had another joke in the chat room.
10131593	10132353	This is pretty funny.
10132833	10134134	John Fields submitted this joke.
10134474	10135735	Okay, two guys are hunting in the woods.
10136215	10137996	One gets hurt and the other goes 9-1-1.
10138036	10140538	The operator says, okay, well, let's make sure he's hurt.
10140858	10142339	There's silence, then a gunshot.
10142839	10144300	Guy comes back on and says, okay, what now?
10146181	10147842	Have I ever told the story of the poo-poo bird?
10147862	10150663	That joke seems right to me.
10150804	10151384	I'm sure he's...
10152327	10153388	He says, my friend's dead.
10153728	10156510	And they're all, well, first make sure that he's dead, you know.
10157151	10158092	And then he kills him.
10158772	10160634	Has anyone here ever heard the story of the Foo Poo Bird?
10160654	10162395	You're such a bitch, Loki.
10162415	10163716	Have you heard the story of the Foo Poo Bird?
10164677	10164817	No.
10165537	10165818	Okay.
10166558	10170081	These three great explorers have hunted this legendary bird called the Foo Poo Bird.
10170842	10173784	The legend is that this bird is making people disappear, but no one knows how.
10174665	10176426	So they go into the deep, deep, deep, deep jungle.
10177287	10181370	And two of them are together, and one of them is by himself, because this one by himself thinks that he's just shit.
10182034	10188096	Well, anyway, he's walking along, and he hears... There's a big wad of bird shit on his head.
10188676	10189476	He does a little crap.
10189516	10191617	He wipes it off, and he disappears.
10193017	10194318	Ooh, scary.
10195178	10202000	So the other two are together, and sure enough, they hear... And one of them gets shit on his head.
10202560	10206542	So he wipes it off, and he disappears, and his friend goes, Oh my god, that's how it happens!
10207682	10209903	But right before he gets to the end of the course...
10213263	10215225	and he gets crap on his head.
10215865	10216966	So he's smart though.
10217066	10217927	He's not wiping it off.
10218407	10220069	So he goes home with a big pile of poo on his head.
10220109	10223091	You know, he gets the best place to sit on the bus and everything.
10223111	10227995	He's, you know, in bed with his wife and his wife goes, you need to wipe that crap off your head.
10228255	10230657	He's like, no, but if I do, I'll disappear and you'll never see me again.
10231017	10232879	Oh, well, I love you and we'll leave the crap on your head.
10232919	10233519	I can live with that.
10233980	10237923	But the stench gets so bad that later on in the night she's like, I can't stand this.
10237943	10238724	She wipes off his head.
10239324	10241506	Oh my god, that was the most awful thing ever.
10242027	10243508	Thank you for wasting everybody's time.
10246271	10246571	Okay.
10246791	10248193	Oh, that was the best joke and you know it.
10259986	10261107	No, the muffin joke's the best joke.
10262547	10269891	A new chatter in the chatroom, Bizarro17, starts off a joke, says, So I said to the prickly cactus, and that was it.
10269931	10272112	There's no prickly cactus.
10272192	10272712	Okay.
10274273	10275694	Alright, we've only got a few minutes left in the show.
10276594	10279675	One thing I definitely want to say, a little special message out there.
10279976	10282457	One of our biggest supporters in the world... Wash behind your ears.
10282857	10283897	Yeah, wash behind your ears.
10284538	10285138	Always floss.
10285238	10285958	No, eat your veggies.
10286299	10287019	Alright, no, seriously.
10288650	10297597	Yes, one of our most faithful listeners, DDR Angel, who I believe has the most lines in chat out of everybody right now, currently.
10298158	10302641	She's just a great supporter of the show, helps us make promos, she was here for an episode a couple months ago.
10303202	10307225	She's leaving for a few months and she won't be around, so she's going to Japan.
10307986	10309947	Oh boo hoo, she has to go to Japan.
10310288	10310968	Poor thing.
10310988	10311629	Is she listening right now?
10312269	10313190	Yes, of course she's listening.
10313750	10316513	Send me an email and I'll give you my address so that we can write while you're in Japan.
10317093	10317934	Yeah, okay, that'll be fun.
10318396	10320717	I mean, email is one thing, but I want to send letters.
10321658	10322318	Okay, cool.
10323219	10324099	Yeah, send us stuff.
10324740	10325340	That'll be fun.
10325860	10329882	So, Angel's going off to Japan, so have a great time.
10329922	10330483	We'll miss you.
10330683	10333284	Get listeners for our show while you're in Japan.
10334025	10336306	And have a fabulous time.
10336326	10336806	We'll miss you.
10338767	10339047	What?
10340528	10342629	No, that was pretty... That was the announcement.
10342669	10342729	Yep.
10342749	10342830	Yep.
10349813	10351074	Oh yeah, the Sak Bomani thing.
10351094	10352475	You were supposed to announce that on the show too.
10352675	10354256	Well, let me just wrap up the Angel thing.
10355096	10355597	What, the winner?
10356357	10356677	Yeah.
10358298	10358558	Oops.
10359819	10362000	What, you didn't tabulate the votes in time or something?
10362921	10363421	Actually, I did.
10364482	10364842	The winner.
10366723	10367664	Everyone likes JB's.
10368925	10371066	So JB, get it the hell finished so we can put it up.
10372290	10373951	Alright, but Loki, you know what?
10374952	10381317	I'm thinking that design that you did may not go to waste, because I'm thinking maybe it's time to renovate the Orange Lounge site again.
10382378	10386521	I actually want to use that for March Madness.
10388242	10389843	Alright, we'll figure it out.
10390764	10395788	I don't know, I just need something that loads faster on my site, and I think it loads pretty damn fast, so we'll see.
10401730	10402650	God, Jesus, and St.
10402690	10403251	Peter are golfing.
10403271	10403371	St.
10403391	10407973	Peter steps up to the tee.
10408033	10408693	He takes a big swing.
10408753	10409233	He hits the ball.
10409253	10410234	It goes up into the air.
10410294	10413776	It lands ten feet from the cup.
10413796	10414276	Jesus steps up.
10414316	10415696	He takes a huge swing.
10415716	10416297	The ball goes flying.
10416317	10417937	It lands two feet from the cup.
10430303	10434626	God steps up, he takes the biggest swing you could ever see, the ball piddles off the tee.
10434746	10444313	All of a sudden, a weasel comes out and picks the ball up, runs off, an eagle comes by, picks the weasel up and flies away, a hurricane comes by, blows the eagle back, and the eagle drops the weasel.
10446891	10448652	And, hold on, because it's a little bit here.
10448672	10456796	Oh yeah, the weasel drops the ball, the ball rolls into the cup, Jesus looks at God and says, Are you gonna play golf or are you just gonna fuck around?
10456997	10466041	You're going to hell for that, that's pretty funny.
10466502	10467622	Yeah, well, we're all going to hell.
10469223	10470984	If you listen to this show, you're probably going to hell.
10472084	10474826	The guy who made that t-shirt from hell.com is going to hell.
10478015	10480476	Alright, how about a sim update for the week, Loki?
10480696	10481957	Anything you want to say about the sim world?
10481977	10483057	Give me a cracker.
10483558	10486179	Freaking site, not up.
10486999	10489080	Yeah, let's see.
10490241	10494323	I know there's more Stepmania updates.
10494383	10498545	I know they keep doing CVS snapshots or whatever.
10498625	10505208	So just keep watching those because they keep getting better and better and stuff.
10506108	10510293	They have a bunch of cool modifiers like I mentioned before, like all the DDR Extreme stuff.
10511435	10517362	And the Monty Sims, now they have stuff.
10517402	10525432	The Monty Style just got, they're uploading their media section again because they switched to a dedicated server thanks to everyone's donations.
10526493	10532778	So they're going to be up pretty soon with all the media and stuff and all the 8-style videos and whatnot.
10533619	10534620	So they're going to be coming up.
10534660	10540885	DDRUK is doing some weird thing with, you know, you have to be like some registered member and whatnot to download shit.
10541025	10542586	You can't even download it anyway.
10542747	10549232	Not that that matters anyways when my site comes up because I'm just going to have everything and say, whatever, I don't require anything, just download the hell.
10550546	10554391	But yeah, my site, yeah, it's funny, yeah.
10555713	10557135	Working on it, really am.
10557516	10560700	There's a lot of shit I gotta update in order to get this site up.
10561221	10566148	Mainly I'm working on the sim files, getting them all zipped up, putting in appropriate CD tags with them.
10566568	10573716	But a lot of the sim files are incomplete, need to be fixed, need to make new backgrounds for them, just fix them up.
10573956	10577259	And so that's what's taking the longest time right now.
10577680	10579121	Right now I've got everything done.
10579162	10582105	I have second style, third style, and I'm almost done with fourth style.
10582585	10587691	Problem is it's going to get even slower now because the higher up I go, the more sim files I have.
10588391	10591333	So once those are done, I promise they'll all be up.
10591393	10595216	It'll probably be like a good 600 files up at the first update.
10595236	10598438	So it'll be worth it, but it's just going to take a while before that comes up.
10599119	10609046	And just so you guys know, listening, there will be every week, there will be a nice hidden page for exclusive to the listeners with sim file stuff that will not be on the site.
10609426	10615651	and maybe I'll give it a month before I update those onto the actual site off the hidden pages.
10615771	10618273	But those will be exclusive for the listeners of the show.
10618293	10620715	You'll have exclusive DWIs before everyone else.
10620776	10622197	So, enjoy.
10622918	10629964	There's actually a pretty decent Stepmania theme that was posted on stepmania.com.
10630164	10632606	It's called Forever Blue 2.0 or something.
10633187	10638091	It's, I would say, a very different take on the themes you're used to.
10638131	10640193	It's more of like a gothic type theme.
10640293	10644076	The freeze arrows are like blue and stuff like that.
10644176	10648059	It's actually a pretty interesting one if you download it just to see it, if anything.
10648940	10659470	That was done by Healing Vision, one of the best fucking artists out there, and really awesome sim file maker, makes everything just like an official Konami mix, so, yeah.
10660872	10661252	What's up?
10663714	10665156	Twin-made announcer packs.
10665583	10670368	No, actually, Twin, all he did was he ripped the announcers and he ripped up the thing.
10671068	10677294	In fact, he was actually bitching about, that was one of the things he bitched about me a while back, is he wanted me to send the announcer stuff, whatever.
10677795	10682620	You know, that's cool that he released the announcers for Solo and shit, even though... Toon Can Lady?
10683400	10684802	Oh yeah, I have those on my computer.
10684842	10687485	I could have released them at any point, but you know, I just don't care.
10687845	10691690	Instead, I'm just going to release them all at once, so it really doesn't matter to me.
10691770	10692711	He doesn't bother me at all.
10693552	10701241	Him with his announcer packs in high-quality, high-res banners, because that's all he can rip from the poor DDR disks.
10703018	10703919	How did he even get them?
10705060	10706461	It's just the same way I get them.
10706501	10708062	You just rip them from the arcade disc.
10708143	10709804	You know someone, you get to this image.
10710525	10711105	Whoop-de-doo.
10711465	10712987	So off of his Korean 2-disc.
10713007	10713487	Well, guess what?
10713587	10714808	I own an official one!
10715469	10715989	Not that I care.
10716069	10716430	Whatever.
10717190	10717791	Yeah, go ahead.
10718291	10719292	Release your banners and stuff.
10719372	10720613	I'll release my site with 2,000 DWIs on it.
10724482	10724882	My Yahoo win.
10740083	10741024	You guys can talk offline.
10741204	10741724	Set that all up.
10742485	10747728	Okay, one other quick thing I want to talk about before we go off the air tonight is waste of time websites.
10747748	10749049	Because we were talking about Neopets.com.
10749069	10750170	Neopets is not a waste of time.
10750190	10751411	What a fucking waste of time.
10751471	10752772	What a fucking waste of time.
10754133	10755394	It's worse than Animal Crossing.
10758823	10761684	This site is the best website ever.
10762244	10765745	It's maddox.xmission.com.
10766325	10770526	It's maddox.xmission.com.
10770906	10778268	And that's got the crazy guy who rants about different things, and he has some really funny ones on there.
10778948	10780429	So definitely check those out.
10781289	10786475	Another one that's funny is one that Vandalist posted in the Sakimani forums.
10786836	10790139	The one where they had the little Mario-like video that the guy made.
10791020	10796026	It was called like, Mac Daddy Mario was the topic on Sakimani.
10796547	10801713	And the guy actually went and made a bunch of little videos and movies using Nintendo characters.
10802854	10803774	It's actually pretty cool.
10803814	10811579	They have like one Mario's dancing to like disco music and then Peach comes up to him and they start dancing together.
10811659	10813601	So it's actually pretty good, if not kind of cheesy.
10816883	10821026	TheSmokingGun.com It's news, but it's really cool.
10821746	10822287	And The Onion.
10823327	10827550	A new one that came up this week, NationStates.net Yes, Dan does that.
10827610	10828731	Have you made your nation yet?
10829512	10831433	I haven't yet, but Dan's done his Gunstaria.
10833059	10833400	Oh, okay.
10833420	10833780	You know what?
10833800	10838765	There's a whole... The DDR crew's got this lazy college students.
10838785	10840727	There's a whole bunch of Amani people getting into this thing.
10840827	10841528	I'm even on it now.
10841868	10844131	The Queendom of Batston is up.
10844611	10845372	That's mine.
10845732	10847414	Maybe I should do Sac of Amania.
10848578	10849219	Hey, that would be cool.
10849600	10853165	You make your own nation and then you decide on issues and you run it.
10853245	10856970	And you can be like an evil dictatorship or you can be... Loki, it's hella your thing.
10857711	10858492	It's hella your thing.
10858713	10861457	You know, I used to do something like that when I was in middle school.
10862037	10865002	We would create our countries and run it and everything and then we'd have a war.
10866633	10882744	That was funny, is the way my country, or we did this thing in sociology, like, you know, trying to depict the best way society should be run, and the way it would work the best, and mine ended up turning into, like, oh, I don't know, neo-Nazism.
10883584	10885385	That's the way mine was, but it worked.
10885826	10886346	I don't know.
10886886	10887807	Maybe there's something to it.
10890487	10892128	I probably have a nice social estate.
10894669	10898370	Alright, I think we ought to wrap up the show now, because we're running over a little bit.
10898410	10900851	We're going to do the nation of Pacmania.
10901531	10901791	That's cool.
10901811	10902992	And have the currency be the dot.
10904432	10904992	That's cool.
10905493	10906293	Can't you make more than one?
10906313	10907833	And the national animal be the ghost monster.
10908414	10908514	Oh.
10910835	10912715	Alright, we're running over a little bit, so, final thoughts.
10914656	10916036	You dropped pussy all over.
10917077	10917217	Uh...
10918897	10920398	Zero, any final thoughts for the day?
10921759	10926761	Um, not really, just, I don't know, play more GDR and listen to the next shows.
10927962	10929843	I don't know, I'm dumb right now, don't worry.
10931724	10933464	Um, all work and no play makes me you.
10936066	10936386	Jamie?
10936766	10938167	Shrimp chips own your soul.
10938707	10939528	They taste like pussy.
10942209	10942569	Loki?
10943049	10946291	I've had a headache for 24 hours and so I can't wait till tomorrow.
