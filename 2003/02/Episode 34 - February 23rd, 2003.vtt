Also, in this corner, say hello to our tech master, Loki.

02:15.240 --> 02:21.240

Beautiful.

02:25.240 --> 02:32.240
Excuse me. Also in studio tonight, say hello to... Zero's back!

02:32.240 --> 02:39.240
He's going to end up being like Loki. He's just going to show up for every week until we decide to add him on.

02:39.240 --> 02:43.240
No, no, it's cool. It's cool. We're just fucking with you.

02:43.240 --> 02:49.240
I thought she was waving hello. Was that a hello or goodbye? I hate English.

02:54.240 --> 03:00.240
You know what? They're thinking that that might be a dead mic. Hold on. We're having some technical difficulties. Let's try this again real fast.

03:00.240 --> 03:06.700
real fast. Here, use my mic. God dammit. The show's falling apart already. Alright, go

03:06.700 --> 03:08.920
around and introduce yourselves one more time with a mic that works and I'll figure out

03:08.920 --> 03:25.920
what's going on with the other one. Alright, I will. I'm not eating. Hi. Can you hear me

03:25.920 --> 03:29.920

03:41.920 --> 03:44.920
Sky. Come on girls, it's time to drop the bomb.

03:44.920 --> 03:48.920
Loki. I can't, for the life of me, get the hooker to have sex with me.

03:48.920 --> 03:51.920
What kind of war human being would find that funny?

03:51.920 --> 03:55.920
Orange Lounge Radio

04:21.920 --> 04:25.080
separate

04:25.080 --> 04:26.440

04:46.720 --> 04:51.160

04:51.160 --> 04:54.520

04:58.520 --> 05:01.160

uh... and then uh... one

05:12.560 --> 05:15.640
semi-annual diapers

05:15.640 --> 05:21.640
You know, Walgreens has some depends-on-sale half fries.

05:21.640 --> 05:25.640
You could just put, like, teals on my shoes.

05:25.640 --> 05:26.640
Then you'd have Heelys.

05:26.640 --> 05:30.640
But that's not funny. How about a training bra?

05:30.640 --> 05:33.640
He'd have to wear it on his head and go around and do it.

05:33.640 --> 05:35.640
I have a picture of Mel B with panties on his head.

05:35.640 --> 05:37.640
I saw that picture.

05:37.640 --> 05:40.640
I'm sorry, but you just made me think it's an understation joke.

05:40.640 --> 05:41.640
Oh, what's that?

05:41.640 --> 05:44.640
If you wore the bra on his head, it'd be Queen Amidala.

05:44.640 --> 05:46.760
clean up about

05:46.760 --> 05:50.620
and that is because i have to listen under station like dot org back up and

05:50.620 --> 05:53.420

06:14.940 --> 06:19.940
We'll be talking about Cyberbeat tonight, the big tourney that happened in SoCal for a little bit.

06:19.940 --> 06:22.940
We got some clips from the interviews and stuff. That'll be fun.

06:22.940 --> 06:25.940
Don't be able to be paid out of vinegar.

06:25.940 --> 06:27.940
Rob, do you feel about so fresh?

06:27.940 --> 06:32.940
I have that not-so-fresh feeling once in a while.

06:32.940 --> 06:33.940
To it.

06:33.940 --> 06:35.940
Alright, we'll be right back.

06:35.940 --> 06:42.940
Here's some anothers for your listening pleasure on Orange Launch Radio.

08:05.940 --> 08:34.940
Fuck off, come on

08:34.940 --> 08:36.940

08:38.940 --> 08:40.940
I'm sad

08:48.940 --> 08:50.940
I'm gone

08:50.940 --> 09:00.940
I'll die if you stick your foot back up in the kitchen

09:00.940 --> 09:08.940
I'll die if you stick your foot back up in the kitchen

09:38.940 --> 09:40.940
CHEERING

10:38.940 --> 10:44.540
Don't you know that we've been together all the time?

10:44.540 --> 10:47.740
Tonight we'll be together all the time

10:47.740 --> 10:50.740
So if I don't mind having a touch

10:50.740 --> 10:54.340
I'll be with you whenever I'm ready

10:54.340 --> 11:00.740
I'll be with you whenever I'm ready

11:30.740 --> 11:37.740
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

12:30.740 --> 12:34.740
She laid pins on her neck, said

13:00.740 --> 13:09.740
Hi, this is Melby of RTF. Looking for an extra $1.99 a minute, my girlfriend Melby can join us on all the fun together.

13:09.740 --> 13:15.740
Hey, if you're a broke-ass like I am, why don't you come to the one place that costs absolutely nothing to go to and still the fun is just as great.

13:15.740 --> 13:23.740
It's Orange Lounge Radio, Sunday nights. Kick it with me and you just might realize the best things in life are free.

13:23.740 --> 13:28.740
Yes, indeedly the best things in life are free. You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio, which is free.

13:28.740 --> 13:30.740
Um, yeah.

13:30.740 --> 13:36.740
Contrary to popular belief with the whole switching over to Live 365, you have to be registered now to listen to our station.

13:36.740 --> 13:42.740
Which, obviously, if you're hearing us right now, you must be registered and tuning in.

13:42.740 --> 13:49.740
But if you know somebody that's trying to get in that can't, you have to remind them that they have to now be signed up through Live365.com.

13:49.740 --> 13:54.740
Registration is absolutely 100% free and they've promised us they will not spam your email.

13:54.740 --> 13:57.100
email but if you're nervous about that kind of stuff

13:57.100 --> 14:00.660
i think it's a good internet policy to just have a hotmail yahoo a free email

14:00.660 --> 14:03.420
account you just send anything

14:03.420 --> 14:05.980
you can't guard yeah yahoo spam guards excellent

14:05.980 --> 14:06.960
anything uses

14:06.960 --> 14:08.760
suspect might be spamming you

14:08.760 --> 14:12.260
send it over one of those i would like to go and there's a little it

14:12.260 --> 14:16.140
i think i get like two hundred fifty messages that day well

14:16.140 --> 14:18.800
tangency i know some people to get so much

14:18.800 --> 14:21.620
yahoo spam but i'd hardly get any

14:21.620 --> 14:27.620
It's all sent to my trash, but see the thing is it doesn't empty fast enough. I have to go in there and empty my trash like six times a day.

14:27.620 --> 14:32.620
Because after like one day I'll see that there's 75 messages in trash.

14:32.620 --> 14:33.620
There's a bulk folder.

14:33.620 --> 14:37.620
Yeah, 75 messages in trash, 26 in bulk, and like 2 in my other one.

14:37.620 --> 14:43.620
And the 2, they're actually in my inbox. Both are spam.

14:43.620 --> 14:45.620
You know you can block the addresses.

14:45.620 --> 14:48.620
I've already have 100 blocked addresses.

14:48.620 --> 14:50.620
Jeez.

14:50.620 --> 14:53.700
it's spammers are so high-tech nowadays that they're

14:53.700 --> 14:57.340
they change their driving their email you from a new address each time see if

14:57.340 --> 14:59.140
you block it they just go to you know

14:59.140 --> 15:02.580
say you're getting spammed from low key one then they'll just go to look at you

15:02.580 --> 15:03.500
and look at three

15:03.500 --> 15:07.100
one I'm started in as block you can block domains on there also

15:07.100 --> 15:14.660
block AOL just kidding okay so but you know that they're thinking about pass

15:14.660 --> 15:16.620
along california makes them totally legal

15:16.620 --> 15:20.140
which would be cool course junk mail still legal

15:20.140 --> 15:24.020
But you can also, if I remember right, you can go to the post office

15:24.020 --> 15:27.380
and request that they not give you any junk mail and they'll do it.

15:27.380 --> 15:31.020
But that means you don't get like the cards for the missing kids or any of that stuff.

15:31.020 --> 15:31.980
You don't get anything.

15:31.980 --> 15:35.820
One thing though that should be, people should realize,

15:35.820 --> 15:39.580
if you want a lot of that information when you get into and don't want telemarketer

15:39.580 --> 15:41.340
calls, whenever a telemarketer calls you

15:41.340 --> 15:45.700
tell them to opt you out. It is a federal privacy law.

15:45.700 --> 15:49.740
I work for a mortgage company now. I used to work in customer service for one. Tell them to opt you out.

15:49.740 --> 15:53.260
out if you have a mortgage if you live with people who have a mortgage tell

15:53.260 --> 15:58.740
them to have their servicer opt you out of all outside communication not to

15:58.740 --> 16:05.580
share your information call the three credit bureau reporting trying to

16:05.580 --> 16:11.140
remember what they are off the top of my head there's a Equifax there's one of

16:11.140 --> 16:15.260
them Equifax yeah Equifax there's two others but I don't remember off the top of my

16:15.260 --> 16:19.380
head but you can also write your credit bureaus and have them not share your

16:19.380 --> 16:21.180
information, because that's the primary way they get it.

16:21.180 --> 16:24.300
I was going to say, a lot of people also know it as the

16:24.300 --> 16:25.260
don't call list.

16:25.260 --> 16:27.060
If you tell a telemarketer to put you on the don't call

16:27.060 --> 16:27.980
list, then they have to.

16:27.980 --> 16:30.820
Otherwise, that's regular law.

16:30.820 --> 16:31.980
Yep.

16:31.980 --> 16:36.340
But that right there, since we used to get about two, three

16:36.340 --> 16:40.180
telemarketer calls a night sometimes, I called one of

16:40.180 --> 16:41.740
them and said, opt us out.

16:41.740 --> 16:43.940
We didn't get a single one for the next month.

16:43.940 --> 16:46.820
And for junk mail, if you wanted, this is great.

16:46.820 --> 16:51.180
Matt X from his wonderful site recommended this.

16:51.180 --> 16:53.700
When you get those credit card applications in the mail,

16:53.700 --> 16:57.460
take your junk mail, stick them in the nice little prepaid

16:57.460 --> 17:00.580
envelope given to you by the credit card mailer,

17:00.580 --> 17:02.500
and look, you got rid of your junk mail

17:02.500 --> 17:05.020
and the stupid credit card companies

17:05.020 --> 17:08.660
stop mailing you because you're sending them back junk mail.

17:08.660 --> 17:11.780
You can also just write three lovely words

17:11.780 --> 17:14.060
on top of every last bit of that junk mail.

17:14.060 --> 17:16.540
Return to sender.

17:16.540 --> 17:20.540
it works?

17:20.540 --> 17:24.540
Theceased is great. When you're at theceased, you don't get it mailed anymore.

17:24.540 --> 17:28.540
I've done that with a couple of them, but it works.

17:28.540 --> 17:32.540
That's messed up, but funny. Wasn't that an old 80's song, Returns?

17:32.540 --> 17:36.540
I guess. I don't know, anyway.

17:36.540 --> 17:40.540
Chat room's kind of dead right now. I'm starting to wonder if I pinged out, because I'm not seeing anything. Of course, our chat room's been having

17:40.540 --> 17:44.540
some issues all day. Other side IRC. Oh, there we go, we have some

17:44.540 --> 17:48.920
some chatting going on now. It's alive! It's alive, it's alive. IRC has been kind of broken

17:48.920 --> 17:53.520
half the day today, so I think it's all better now, but just in case, go ahead. There's a

17:53.520 --> 17:57.680
big bandaid on it. If you're not being able to get in through your normal means, go ahead

17:57.680 --> 18:03.980
and go to our Java page at orangelounge.skie.cx, click on Chat, and use the Java applet, because

18:03.980 --> 18:11.560
the server that the Java applet points to works fine. So you can use that. Cool, huh?

18:11.560 --> 18:15.200
Jamie brought treats. What kind of treats did you bring tonight?

18:15.200 --> 18:21.080
Shrimp chips. Because every snack I get has to have some kind of connotation.

18:21.080 --> 18:25.240
So I got shrimp chips this time. And sweet potato chips.

18:25.240 --> 18:29.120
I don't like shrimp chips. I mean they're okay but they just

18:29.120 --> 18:33.120
they're so weird to me. Like when I eat shrimp I expect to be eating

18:33.120 --> 18:38.120
like Long John Silver's ghetto deep-fried shrimp.

18:38.120 --> 18:46.680
shimpy. They don't really taste like shrimp. They smell like ass, actually. They smell

18:46.680 --> 18:52.400
like rank pussy, that's what it smells like. They're yummy. Damn it, I like pussy. I mean,

18:52.400 --> 18:59.120
please. So how was the, uh, how was the drunk show last week? I wasn't, I wasn't here to

18:59.120 --> 19:04.560
experience it, unfortunately, but, um, this is something EOSFBB gave me a link to, I'll

19:04.560 --> 19:05.840
I'll get to it in a minute.

19:05.840 --> 19:07.800
Well, how did things go last week?

19:07.800 --> 19:08.760
I was drunk.

19:08.760 --> 19:09.520
I haven't listened to it.

19:09.520 --> 19:10.760
How drunk did you guys get?

19:10.760 --> 19:11.280
Not very.

19:11.280 --> 19:12.600
Not me, anyway.

19:12.600 --> 19:14.920
Melody was really silly.

19:14.920 --> 19:16.160
I just got, like, drunk.

19:16.160 --> 19:18.800
OK, this is what I had.

19:18.800 --> 19:25.400
I had about four things of, actually, I drank out

19:25.400 --> 19:29.560
of this flask of, what was that, Dutch chocolate liqueur

19:29.560 --> 19:30.640
that Melody bought?

19:30.640 --> 19:31.140
Kahlua?

19:31.140 --> 19:31.640
No.

19:31.640 --> 19:32.440
No.

19:32.440 --> 19:34.440
It's Dutch chocolate, so really good chocolate.

19:34.440 --> 19:40.120
chocolate liqueur. I had a few swallows of that out of a flask.

19:40.120 --> 19:42.480
Were you drinking straight out of the bottle?

19:42.480 --> 19:44.800
That's ghetto.

19:44.800 --> 19:48.960
I made this drink with vanilla soy milk and Godiva liqueur.

19:48.960 --> 19:50.620
No, this one brand of soy milk.

19:50.620 --> 19:51.700
I'm making a face.

19:51.700 --> 19:56.180
This one brand of soy milk, you can't even tell it's soy milk. It's very creamy, like real milk.

19:56.180 --> 19:57.300
Mmm, creamy.

19:57.300 --> 20:03.480
I do, I do, I do.

20:03.480 --> 20:06.800
But it was, I had like four of those or something.

20:06.800 --> 20:10.480
And then I had a shot of vodka.

20:10.480 --> 20:13.200
No, it wasn't vodka, I had a shot of rum.

20:13.200 --> 20:18.200
I had three of those,

20:22.360 --> 20:24.280
this Mernoff Ice Triple Blacks.

20:24.280 --> 20:26.600
Ooh, those are so good, mmm, yum, yum, yum.

20:26.600 --> 20:30.160
Did anyone get super crazy or naked or super, no?

20:30.160 --> 20:33.840
Ross brought a 40 of St. Ives.

20:33.840 --> 20:36.960
No, but the show went south when I brought my video over.

20:36.960 --> 20:40.040
Yeah, everyone went downstairs to watch this video right here.

20:40.040 --> 20:43.840
The Ron Jeremy porn star video?

20:43.840 --> 20:48.160
Yay! Yeah, I want to see it. I heard about it.

20:48.160 --> 20:51.880
How exciting.

20:51.880 --> 20:54.880
I always wanted to see a man kiss his own penis. Not really.

20:54.880 --> 20:58.640
Not you.

20:58.640 --> 21:04.560
I just did this little, this little jerk motion that made me look like I was about to do it

21:04.560 --> 21:06.560
and shame I got scared.

21:06.560 --> 21:09.200
What are these, sweet potato chips?

21:09.200 --> 21:10.200
Let's read the back.

21:10.200 --> 21:14.780
Sweet potato chips is made with sweet potato and made of golden crunch, containing no preservatives

21:14.780 --> 21:16.200
and no cholesterol.

21:16.200 --> 21:18.400
It's an ideal snack for all ages.

21:18.400 --> 21:19.960
Eat some!

21:19.960 --> 21:20.960
Eat it!

21:20.960 --> 21:21.960
Eat it!

21:21.960 --> 21:22.960
Well?

21:22.960 --> 21:27.400
Well, they're okay.

21:27.400 --> 21:29.400
They're no Pringles, but they're good.

21:29.400 --> 21:30.400
They're better.

21:30.400 --> 21:32.720
They may not have sweet potatoes and they're yummy.

21:32.720 --> 21:33.920
What happened with Match Game?

21:33.920 --> 21:35.640
People in the shower room were talking about Match Game.

21:35.640 --> 21:38.640
We kept talking about Run, Jeremy.

21:38.640 --> 21:39.640
Jesus.

21:39.640 --> 21:41.280
I didn't save it, unfortunately.

21:41.280 --> 21:47.960
Oh, speaking of kissing penis, the OSFBB wanted me to share this article with you all.

21:47.960 --> 21:48.960
Mr. Spanky!

21:48.960 --> 21:49.960
Mr. Spanky!

21:49.960 --> 21:52.200
Oh, you want Mr. Spanky to do it?

21:52.200 --> 21:58.200
Alright, we'll get Mr. Spanky in here. Hold on. We gotta call Mr. Spanky. Jamie, call Mr. Spanky.

21:58.200 --> 22:05.200
Beep, beep, beep, beep. Mr. Spanky!

22:05.200 --> 22:06.200
That was retarded.

22:06.200 --> 22:08.200
Yes it was.

22:08.200 --> 22:11.200
Then why don't you call Mr. Spanky?

22:11.200 --> 22:14.200
What the fuck? No.

22:14.200 --> 22:16.200
I'll do it all night.

22:16.200 --> 22:21.200
Paging Mr. Spanky. Mr. Spanky, you have a call at the front desk.

22:21.200 --> 22:30.680
we have a winner mr. Spanky would now like to read you this article it's

22:30.680 --> 22:37.360
called teens asked to consider oral sex in London school children under 16 are

22:37.360 --> 22:42.400
being encouraged to experiment with oral sex as part of a government-backed drive

22:42.400 --> 22:46.880
to cut Britain's sky-high teenage pregnancy rate the time said the scheme

22:46.880 --> 22:50.000
pioneered by a university and backed by the Department of Health and Education

22:50.000 --> 22:57.040
Education, trains teachers to discuss pre-sex stopping points.

22:57.040 --> 23:02.240
The idea is to reduce promiscuity by encouraging pupils to discover levels of intimacy, including

23:02.240 --> 23:05.700
oral sex, instead of full sexual intercourse.

23:05.700 --> 23:09.460
But family campaigners condemned the accord, saying it would only encourage children to

23:09.460 --> 23:15.420
experiment with sex.

23:15.420 --> 23:17.940
The director of the Family Education Trust told the newspaper,

23:17.940 --> 23:22.940
I don't think that anyone believes that teaching people about oral sex will stop them from having full sex

23:23.060 --> 23:28.060
It's more likely to make them want to try it. It doesn't protect them against sexually transmitted diseases

23:30.940 --> 23:33.900
Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah

23:33.900 --> 23:40.340
Oh Britain has the highest teenage pregnancy rate in Western Europe. The government has a set target of having levels by 2010

23:40.900 --> 23:42.900
Bye

23:43.380 --> 23:45.380
No

23:45.380 --> 23:46.380
Ah!

23:46.380 --> 23:49.260
Yes, that was a fun article, wasn't it?

23:49.260 --> 23:50.260
This is coming from Yahoo!

23:50.260 --> 23:51.260
News.

23:51.260 --> 23:54.460
The same people that also brought us a wonderful article a couple of days ago about the Congo

23:54.460 --> 23:56.060
teachers who are, um...

23:56.060 --> 23:59.060
Is this about the Ebola virus or something?

23:59.060 --> 24:00.060
The Ebola spell.

24:00.060 --> 24:01.060
Yeah, the Congo teachers...

24:01.060 --> 24:03.060
I put a spell on you!

24:03.060 --> 24:07.140
...were stoned to death for casting the Ebola spell.

24:07.140 --> 24:09.260
I wanted to read some of the Yahoo!

24:09.260 --> 24:10.940
Talkbacks here, because Yahoo!

24:10.940 --> 24:12.620
There's nothing better on Yahoo!

24:12.620 --> 24:13.620
News than Yahoo!

24:13.620 --> 24:14.620
Talkbacks.

24:14.620 --> 24:22.300
some juice let's see oh we have God is the answer I think that it's terrible

24:22.300 --> 24:27.540
they should teach them about God the station folk thus should focus this guy's

24:27.540 --> 24:31.380
got a great education here thus should focus and what the Bible says want to

24:31.380 --> 24:39.460
give a good advice get it from the Bible that sounds like English yeah I'm sorry

24:39.460 --> 24:45.860
would you say zero? He was educated in Britain. God is the answer. Let's see, let's look at

24:45.860 --> 24:48.620
Reid, God is the answer. You could have been saying, you know, dog is the answer, but you

24:48.620 --> 24:57.380
know, we wouldn't know. Let's see, God is the answer. None of these replies are any

24:57.380 --> 25:02.780
good. I also think it's terrible that they should teach them about God. Religion in school

25:02.780 --> 25:07.820
doesn't mix, but sex ed is a real issue, not some religious one. Let's see, what else is

25:37.820 --> 25:42.840
Well, let's see...

25:42.840 --> 25:45.100
Lucky be the man who's skilled at hand.

25:45.100 --> 25:51.800
All right, thank you for bringing this show down to a whole new level, you know, Speeby!

25:51.800 --> 25:54.920
Ah, sorry I had to burp there.

25:54.920 --> 25:59.260
Oh, it's weird, being gone for a week, and having to come back it's like I feel

25:59.260 --> 26:01.420
like I haven't done this for like a whole month.

26:01.420 --> 26:03.200
Oh, yeah...

26:03.200 --> 26:06.840
Anything else of interest happen last week, Loggy?

26:06.840 --> 26:08.840
Okay.

26:08.840 --> 26:11.840
No, um, I don't know.

26:11.840 --> 26:14.840
I want more metal pads off of eBay.

26:14.840 --> 26:18.840
Oh, you know what? I'm going to be giving away. I'm going to, um...

26:18.840 --> 26:23.840
I'm going to get these. My friend Matt is going to give them to me for free. My other friend Matt's going to give them to me for free.

26:23.840 --> 26:27.840
And I think we might do some kind of giveaway. It's going to have to be more local giveaway.

26:27.840 --> 26:29.840
They're wannabe ignition pads.

26:29.840 --> 26:32.840
They're not ignition pads, but they're the knockoff wannabe kind.

26:32.840 --> 26:35.840
And I don't really have a use for them, so I think we're going to do some kind of giveaway.

26:35.840 --> 26:38.840
I just don't know how yet, because I can't afford to ship them to anybody.

26:38.840 --> 26:41.840
So they're going to have to be some kind of local giveaway. I don't know.

26:41.840 --> 26:45.840
We should just hook them up and see how badly we can thrash them.

26:45.840 --> 26:48.840
Oh, you just want to beat them up on air?

26:48.840 --> 26:52.840
We could dissect a wannabe ignition pad live on air. That would be fun.

26:52.840 --> 26:56.840
No, that's stupid. I've done it before.

26:56.840 --> 27:01.840
Oh, we could set it on fire, except we have no place to set it on fire at.

27:01.840 --> 27:02.840
Okay, here.

27:02.840 --> 27:03.840
That smells good.

27:03.840 --> 27:04.840
What is that?

27:04.840 --> 27:06.960
It looks like blood.

27:06.960 --> 27:08.380
It looks like blood.

27:08.380 --> 27:10.240
Jamie brought blood back here.

27:10.240 --> 27:14.840
That's cranberry grape?

27:14.840 --> 27:16.840
Anyway.

27:16.840 --> 27:22.120
Is cranberry apple Martinelli's?

27:22.120 --> 27:24.360
You know giant Matt, right?

27:24.360 --> 27:26.640
Giant Matt's giving me two wannabe ignition pads.

27:26.640 --> 27:29.000
They're not ignition pads, they're the wannabe ones.

27:29.000 --> 27:30.780
Some third party ignition pads.

27:30.780 --> 27:31.780
I don't know.

27:31.780 --> 27:39.080
some kind of giveaway. You just want me to give them to you? Why don't I give you one

27:39.080 --> 27:43.740
and then we can give the other one away? Okay. But we can't afford for shipping, although

27:43.740 --> 27:47.100
some people are saying they'll pay for shipping. Well, we'll think it's some kind of contest.

27:47.100 --> 27:54.940
Maybe we can do something. How about the DWI contest? Okay. Okay. Okay, so that's going

27:54.940 --> 27:58.580
to be part of the prize for the DWI contest. I like what you think. I like the way this

27:58.580 --> 28:05.480
women things. That's because I think. Alright. I think, therefore I am. I think. We're all

28:05.480 --> 28:09.040
going to be, I was thinking we could do some kind of giveaway at B3, some kind of random

28:09.040 --> 28:12.020
door prize or something, I don't know though how that's all going to work. B3 details are

28:12.020 --> 28:17.180
still being formed, although that is happening in May. May something through 17th, I don't

28:17.180 --> 28:21.420
know what it is, sometime in May. I have an announcement. You have an announcement? Whoo-hoo!

28:21.420 --> 28:25.620
Announcements, announcement. Alright, give your announcement. We have a date set on the

28:25.620 --> 28:31.940
date of March 29th and March 30th. A tournament, more usually, held in the Bay Area is going

28:31.940 --> 28:39.520
to be held at Scandia in Sacramento. March Madness! Yay! We'll have details up on that

28:39.520 --> 28:43.380
and by next week we should be able to give people links to where the rules are and all

28:43.380 --> 28:49.620
that information. But be prepared, this one is not going to be just Perfect Attack. This

28:49.620 --> 28:54.080
one is also going to be Freestyle and Freestyle will be rather unique. Can you tell us more

28:54.080 --> 29:00.400
about that at this time all I have to say is I've heard the proposition that

29:00.400 --> 29:05.080
they're doing for freestyle it is gonna kick so much ass this is really funny

29:05.080 --> 29:09.360
because on the drive down to SoCal we were talking about the exact same thing

29:09.360 --> 29:14.240
and I said I want to see that happen in Sacramento and lo and behold it's gonna

29:14.240 --> 29:21.440
awesome so once again March Madness March 29th and 30th Sacramento scandia

29:21.440 --> 29:24.440
Sacramento Scandia, be here or die.

29:24.440 --> 29:26.440
Or we'll kick your ass.

29:26.440 --> 29:27.840
That's it.

29:27.840 --> 29:31.240
More details forthcoming, keep your eyes on uh...

29:31.240 --> 29:34.440
I don't know, I don't know if we'll get to be an affiliate of that, I'm sure.

29:34.440 --> 29:36.440
Oh, Sacramento sucks.

29:36.440 --> 29:41.440
Do you know what I do? I was just told that on Friday.

29:41.440 --> 29:43.640
You were told that

29:43.640 --> 29:45.600
by someone whose opinion doesn't count.

29:45.600 --> 29:48.940
Oh yes. Anyway.

29:48.940 --> 29:51.540
Oh, you're already getting offers in the chatroom to help with the tournament.

29:51.540 --> 29:54.140
Stay tuned to DDR Freak, we'll have a thread on it,

29:54.140 --> 29:56.140
Sakbamani will have a thread on it for sure.

29:56.140 --> 29:58.740
I will go ahead and say this, sir, we'll be meeting at my house

29:58.740 --> 30:01.840
for people who are in the area, or can make it to the area.

30:01.840 --> 30:06.340
Just send me a private message on Sakbamani.com to DarkSakura

30:06.340 --> 30:09.740
and I'll take any offers of assistance I can.

30:09.740 --> 30:14.340
Yes. Hopefully I'll be participating in that too as the...

30:14.340 --> 30:18.540
Well, I can't say it. I can't say it till more details come out.

30:18.540 --> 30:19.540
The voice.

30:19.540 --> 30:20.540
The voice.

30:20.540 --> 30:21.540
Okay.

30:21.540 --> 30:23.900
When more details come out, we'll be a little...

30:23.900 --> 30:25.900
We won't be so dodgy.

30:25.900 --> 30:26.900
You heard it here first.

30:26.900 --> 30:27.900
Yes, you did.

30:27.900 --> 30:28.900
Or second or third.

30:28.900 --> 30:29.900
I don't know.

30:29.900 --> 30:30.900
First.

30:30.900 --> 30:31.900
Anyway, let's...

30:31.900 --> 30:34.700
Speaking of tournaments, let's get to the Cyberbeat tape, shall we?

30:34.700 --> 30:36.580
Let's hear some of the Cyberbeat stuff.

30:36.580 --> 30:37.580
Oh, God.

30:37.580 --> 30:38.580
Oh, God.

30:38.580 --> 30:39.580
We're just gonna hear...

30:39.580 --> 30:40.580
What we're gonna do is we're gonna play some clips.

30:40.580 --> 30:44.380
We're not gonna play because there's literally probably about an hour and a half of tape

30:44.380 --> 30:47.460
from the Cyberbeat trip, from the L.A. trip.

30:47.460 --> 30:49.620
However, a lot of it is very random.

30:49.620 --> 30:51.940
I swear to God, Wendell went off for 20 minutes

30:51.940 --> 30:54.840
telling us a story about Mike Noe, which is really funny,

30:54.840 --> 30:56.340
but we just don't have the time to do that

30:56.340 --> 30:57.180
on this show right now.

30:57.180 --> 30:58.020
But you'll have to tune in to hear that.

30:58.020 --> 30:59.560
That's right, so if you wanna hear that,

30:59.560 --> 31:02.820
you gotta tune in on Tuesday,

31:02.820 --> 31:04.460
or I'm sorry, no, no, don't tune in on Tuesday.

31:04.460 --> 31:05.380
Well, tune in on Tuesday.

31:05.380 --> 31:06.780
Tune in all the time to Orange on the Radio.

31:06.780 --> 31:09.800
But tune in on Friday at seven o'clock Pacific time,

31:09.800 --> 31:11.620
or Saturday at four o'clock Pacific time.

31:11.620 --> 31:13.460
Those are the two times we're gonna be airing

31:13.460 --> 31:14.960
the Cyber Beat full tapes.

31:14.960 --> 31:16.580
But in the meantime, we're gonna play some clips for you,

31:16.580 --> 31:24.280
these are interviews that we did with some folks and the first set is it's

31:24.280 --> 31:29.260
going to be an excerpt from Saturday this is the day of that PA wrapped up so

31:29.260 --> 31:32.940
we're gonna hear from the winner of perfect attack and we're gonna hear some

Big shades.

What have you baby?

32:47.860 --> 32:48.860
Definitely important to see.

32:48.860 --> 32:50.660
Anything else you want to say to folks out there?

32:50.660 --> 32:52.740
Anything about the tournament or what have you?

32:52.740 --> 32:56.860
The videos will speak for themselves.

32:56.860 --> 32:59.400
Let the videos speak for themselves.

32:59.400 --> 33:00.400
More to come later.

33:00.400 --> 33:03.420
I think we're going to have to interview after that routine.

33:03.420 --> 33:04.420
That's perfect.

33:04.420 --> 33:05.420
Alright, perfect.

33:05.420 --> 33:07.240
Come find me because I'm a lazy bastard.

33:07.240 --> 33:08.620
I don't tape much for the show.

33:08.620 --> 33:09.620
Swear to God I will.

33:09.620 --> 33:10.620
Alright, great.

33:10.620 --> 33:15.620
The videos won't truly get the whole feel of it.

33:15.620 --> 33:18.620
I came to L.A. just for this, so...

33:18.620 --> 33:21.620
RTF domination, baby.

33:21.620 --> 33:23.620
We shall see. Alright.

33:23.620 --> 33:30.620
If you do happen to listen to the Cyberbeat special on Friday or Saturday, listen to how many times Mel B whores out RTF.

33:30.620 --> 33:34.620
It's great. No, it's great to have a lot of pride. It's cool.

33:34.620 --> 33:37.620
And Wendell does horror on Step Squad quite a bit, so...

33:37.620 --> 33:39.620
I'm back later.

33:39.620 --> 33:47.800
It's 5 30 p.m. On Saturday and PA's finally finished. It's all over and I am standing here with the winner say hello everybody to Tigger Eugene

33:47.800 --> 33:52.220
Hey, what's up? So how how intense was that last match pretty?

33:53.500 --> 33:57.080
What it's pretty hard I guess tiring yeah tiring board

33:57.080 --> 34:00.920
I don't know. I know the last match was kind of like weird

34:00.920 --> 34:03.780
How many songs did you have to play in that last match? I was keeping count

34:04.300 --> 34:06.300
What was the toughest one? What's the toughest one for you?

34:06.300 --> 34:13.300
It must have been paranoia, because I think that's the song I really messed up on, Paranoid Survivor, or Survivor Eternal.

34:13.300 --> 34:19.300
Did you train for this at all? Did you practice a lot? How do you do to prepare yourself for something like this?

34:19.300 --> 34:24.300
I went to MGL every day for two weeks, something like that.

34:24.300 --> 34:30.300
You're pretty well known to NorCal, at least, for being the PA guy that seems to walk away on the first ride to all the tournaments.

34:30.300 --> 34:34.300
Did you do anything extra for this, being like it was going to be a big tournament?

34:34.300 --> 34:38.460
What do you mean like it would do anything was there any like extra preparation like was it extra?

34:38.940 --> 34:40.940
Were you extra nervous for this one or?

34:41.420 --> 34:42.380
Yes

34:42.380 --> 34:44.780
Was it just another was it just another day for jigger?

34:44.860 --> 34:47.020
I wasn't another day like I don't know getting kind of weird

34:47.020 --> 34:51.340
I felt like really good like paers and stuff and like I don't yeah that whole training every day thing

34:51.340 --> 34:55.180
That was like well, it's crazy any future tournaments you plan on attending

34:56.060 --> 35:00.140
I don't know any of any like coming up or except for one in seattle. I think my dad's taking me or something

35:00.940 --> 35:03.180
Now I know sure dad comes with you to all the tournaments. That's pretty cool

35:03.180 --> 35:07.280
Like a lot of support a lot of support. Do you get a lot of support from your parents? Yeah, yeah

35:09.540 --> 35:12.220
They don't they don't stand there and punish you if you do bad do you

35:13.860 --> 35:17.660
I'm just joking around of course not of course not, but that's awesome that they show up in this work

35:17.660 --> 35:19.660
Do you do you ever watch the tapes?

35:20.660 --> 35:23.220
What tapes like cuz I know if he taped sometimes? I don't know

35:23.220 --> 35:24.060
Oh, yeah, yeah

35:24.060 --> 35:28.340
And it's cool cuz like people actually asked me for like copies and stuff sometimes because nobody ever tapes PA

35:28.340 --> 35:31.420
It's like PA ain't important. Nobody wants to take that stuff, but your dad does that's cool

35:31.420 --> 35:36.420
Yeah, PA is not important. What you mean by that, man? Come on, man.

35:36.420 --> 35:43.420
No, I mean, but you know, like, if you get on the Internet, there's all the freestyle videos, there's no PA videos. Hey, I'm a PA-er myself, except I was too lazy for this one.

35:43.420 --> 35:44.420
Yeah.

35:44.420 --> 35:46.420
Yeah.

35:46.420 --> 35:49.420
So, anything else you want to say about the tournament? Thoughts for the day?

35:49.420 --> 35:54.420
I don't know. It was cool, because, like, the knockout people were, like, keeping me motivated, like, my girlfriend, and, like, um...

35:54.420 --> 35:55.420
Who, Paul?

35:55.420 --> 36:00.540
window yeah when there is a man when the world it had on mike no

36:00.540 --> 36:02.340

36:12.940 --> 36:13.900
uh...

36:13.900 --> 36:14.980
i don't know

36:14.980 --> 36:17.260
i don't know if i don't know if i could sort of

36:17.260 --> 36:20.500
so far and then i had a but the hundred and one of them

36:20.500 --> 36:23.420
pretty hard to get over now so

36:23.420 --> 36:24.420
They don't make it anymore.

36:24.420 --> 36:25.420
So, have fun with it.

36:25.420 --> 36:26.420
Thanks for being with us.

36:26.420 --> 36:30.580
Alright, so, I'm going to talk to some other folks that have gathered around here, so introduce

36:30.580 --> 36:35.580
yourselves for us, as one runs away.

36:35.580 --> 36:39.020
Come on, I know this guy's going to talk to us, aren't you?

36:39.020 --> 36:43.140
Hello guys, it's me, Bob Lombardi, the one and only, standing here with my partner and

36:43.140 --> 36:44.140
one mic.

36:44.140 --> 36:45.140
Boo-ner.

36:45.140 --> 36:48.100
Are you guys doing a couples routine today?

36:48.100 --> 36:51.980
No, unfortunately, because Christy has a little stage fright, but it's all good, you know.

36:51.980 --> 36:52.980
It's just DDR.

36:52.980 --> 36:57.480
It's only DDR, you know, it's only like, one of the biggest tournaments in SoCal, you know, it's nothing big.

36:57.480 --> 37:02.980
But you know, I mean, honestly, I'm just really glad to be here, cause a lot of things almost kept me from not coming today.

37:02.980 --> 37:04.980
But you know, I mean, what can you say?

37:04.980 --> 37:05.980
Like i5?

37:07.980 --> 37:08.480
BLEEP!

37:08.480 --> 37:09.480
i5, alright.

37:09.480 --> 37:09.980
BLEEP!

37:09.980 --> 37:10.480
The cops on i5.

37:10.480 --> 37:11.980
See, it's internet radio, you can say whatever you want.

37:11.980 --> 37:12.980
Fuck the cops, alright?

37:12.980 --> 37:16.480
Cause man, I swear to God, if they do that shit again, I just will bust their asses, man.

37:16.480 --> 37:17.480
What happened, he got pulled over?

37:17.480 --> 37:19.480
Oh my God, dude, we're fucking driving, right?

37:19.480 --> 37:22.480
Everyone else is going the same speed and shit, and what does this fucking cop do?

37:22.480 --> 37:27.520
You know you're going too fast, what about your family, bitch we're friends, we know

37:27.520 --> 37:28.520
what the fuck we're doing.

37:28.520 --> 37:32.480
So it's like fuck you cops, fuck you highway patrol, you hear that, you give me one more

37:32.480 --> 37:36.000
motherfucking ticket, I'm gonna go like jahi on your asses, alright?

37:36.000 --> 37:40.080
It's an F-you of the week, straight from Bob Lombardi, how about that?

37:40.080 --> 37:43.520
So I noticed a lot of freestyles around here, they're kinda nervous, competition's a little

37:43.520 --> 37:45.660
tight, what are your thoughts going into freestyle?

37:45.660 --> 37:49.360
You know what, when I first came down here, I didn't give a fuck about freestyle, you

37:49.360 --> 37:55.080
I figured I would just go up there, you know, improv something like I usually do, you know?

37:55.080 --> 37:59.080
But then I started talking, you know, like, I mean, people like Wendell, you know, like,

37:59.080 --> 38:04.980
Hypnotics, or Go, excuse me, you know, people like Bruce Leroy, Mel B, you know?

38:04.980 --> 38:09.480
And it's like, you know, they're taking it hella seriously and stuff, and it's like,

38:09.480 --> 38:12.080
you want to take it seriously, but you really don't, because-

38:12.080 --> 38:13.280
How can you take a video game seriously?

38:13.280 --> 38:16.880
Exactly, you know, because when you come back and you look at it, oh yeah, I won number

38:16.880 --> 38:19.200
one at this tourney in SoCal, people will be like, what were you playing?

38:19.200 --> 38:22.500
I was like, man, I was playing Dance Dance Revolution, and I'm like, what?

38:22.500 --> 38:27.040
I had to draw figures for my coworkers to make them understand what it was exactly.

38:27.040 --> 38:28.540
See, that's the whole thing.

38:28.540 --> 38:31.620
Yes, I mean, it's great to be recognized in your community,

38:31.620 --> 38:34.360
but you can't put it on a job application, OK?

38:34.360 --> 38:37.520
Man, I was number one, you know, at this Southern California tournament.

38:37.520 --> 38:38.680
People were cruising my toes.

38:38.680 --> 38:39.720
They'd be like, so?

38:39.720 --> 38:42.540
Maybe if you're auditioning for Broadway, like Chicago.

38:42.540 --> 38:43.080
There you go.

38:43.080 --> 38:43.960
That is a good point.

38:43.960 --> 38:45.280
That is a very good point.

38:45.280 --> 38:48.040
However, you know, I'm once again, I'm going to go up there,

38:48.040 --> 38:51.240
I'm gonna do my thing. You know, if I make it to tomorrow, that's excellent.

38:51.240 --> 38:53.440
If I don't, I still came down here to kick with my friends.

38:53.440 --> 38:54.840
You know, I represent North County Police.

38:54.840 --> 38:56.540
Awesome attitude to have.

38:56.540 --> 38:59.440
Everybody should be like Bob Lombardi, ladies and gentlemen.

38:59.440 --> 39:01.340
Everybody!

39:01.340 --> 39:03.640
La dee da dee da!

39:03.640 --> 39:06.840
Yay!

39:06.840 --> 39:10.540
Any other thoughts that you have for the folks at homelessness?

39:10.540 --> 39:15.840
If you see a police officer drive by after he passes you, flip his ass off.

39:15.840 --> 39:17.840
Fuck the police!

39:17.840 --> 39:18.840
Oh, can we get a little rap?

39:18.840 --> 39:22.840
All right.

39:22.840 --> 39:24.840
So, Mel's back over here too.

39:24.840 --> 39:26.840
What did you think about PA, Mel?

39:26.840 --> 39:28.840
It was, well...

39:28.840 --> 39:29.840
Intense!

39:29.840 --> 39:31.840
That's Wendell's catchphrase.

39:31.840 --> 39:33.840
Hey, sure beats sticking around, but I digress.

39:33.840 --> 39:35.840
PA, man, it's...

39:35.840 --> 39:38.840
I mean, I can honestly say that I was surprised.

39:38.840 --> 39:40.840
I mean, I pretty much...

39:40.840 --> 39:44.840
It was Tigger, and it was pretty much his turn he to lose.

39:44.840 --> 39:46.840
But, you know, it's like, I mean, people did show up

39:46.840 --> 39:50.900
show up and like the thing between JSB though, it was like endless love. I mean, it was like,

39:50.900 --> 39:56.500
if frickin', if Stevie Wonder and like someone else blind had to play tennis, it was like

39:56.500 --> 39:59.620
endless love, man. It was like back and forth, back and forth. Nothing was happening, then

39:59.620 --> 40:03.820
this guy slammed the door like a closer, and uh, props to him, man. I mean, it's kind of

40:03.820 --> 40:04.820
funny that...

40:04.820 --> 40:10.500
Mel, by the way, did a whole bag of crack for this interview. No, I'm just kidding.

40:10.500 --> 40:14.740
I'm trying to think of where this reference leads to. I just, I wasn't, I was following

40:14.740 --> 40:17.420
it that day there must have been something in the smog because I was

40:17.420 --> 40:20.420
totally following him that day and right now I'm listening to this going I have

40:20.420 --> 40:24.740
no idea what you're talking about now well that's okay he forgives me I hope

40:24.740 --> 40:28.560
he went to turn and he don't play a damn game of 2dx but I'm sure someone on

40:28.560 --> 40:31.980
eBay or someone else is gonna make his pockets a little fatter so props to him

40:31.980 --> 40:35.420
props to him so now you can tell us any like surprises we can look forward to

40:35.420 --> 40:38.260
your routine like dig in your mouth

40:38.260 --> 40:45.260
Oh, damn. Um, well, I don't know about surprises. I mean, it's just, there'll be new moves, that's for sure.

40:45.260 --> 40:51.760
New moves I don't know for- I mean, people think they saw my Let's Talk It Over from Miggle 2, but this one's gonna be a complete 180 remix.

40:51.760 --> 40:57.760
It's gonna look pretty tight. I'm just thinking, yeah, it's gonna be enough to be a pretty high qualifier.

40:57.760 --> 41:00.760
And then tomorrow, I'd say it's overdrive.

41:00.760 --> 41:01.760
Alright, we're gonna end it right there.

41:01.760 --> 41:03.260
Did anyone whip out their cock?

41:03.260 --> 41:03.760
What?

41:03.760 --> 41:04.760
Did anyone whip out their cock?

41:04.760 --> 41:30.960
They have in the back karaoke boos where you can go and sit in and sing karaoke songs for

41:30.960 --> 41:34.520
like 50 cents and it grades you on a scale of 0 to 100.

41:34.520 --> 41:38.560
Irene and I probably sat in there like all day Saturday and played that game.

41:38.560 --> 41:42.800
So we missed like half of the first round of freestyle.

41:42.800 --> 41:48.720
The only routines I remember seeing is we saw Bruce Leroy's first routine and we saw

41:48.720 --> 41:49.720
Mel B's first routine.

41:49.720 --> 41:51.760
We saw a whole little handful around there.

41:51.760 --> 41:54.080
Didn't really see much else because we were just too busy playing other stuff.

41:54.080 --> 41:56.700
I got to tell you, that seventh style at CyberZone...

41:56.700 --> 41:57.700
Beautiful.

41:57.700 --> 42:01.360
I saw the picture, by the way, of the karaoke machine and the text on that one.

42:01.360 --> 42:03.560
They brought one of those out.

42:03.560 --> 42:05.360
They had the portable one.

42:05.360 --> 42:11.860
They brought one of those out at our meeting for Thanksgiving, our Thanksgiving dinner,

42:11.860 --> 42:15.360
and it grades you like a percentage based on how accurate you are with the music.

42:15.360 --> 42:16.840
I want one of those.

42:16.840 --> 42:19.600
Buy me.

42:19.600 --> 42:21.720
Look on eBay.

42:21.720 --> 42:25.960
It's funny, they're talking about eBay in the chat room right now.

42:25.960 --> 42:30.960
I guess there's some Max2 machine up for sale on eBay, and an 8th Mix machine.

42:30.960 --> 42:31.960
I don't know, 7th upgrade.

42:31.960 --> 42:33.960
I don't know what the deal is.

42:33.960 --> 42:36.960
I'm going to get them any less than $5,000.

42:36.960 --> 42:38.960
Didn't you just buy something big on eBay recently?

42:38.960 --> 42:40.960
Yeah, I bought two.

42:40.960 --> 42:43.960
Well, they're uh...

42:43.960 --> 42:45.960
Cypher Games.

42:45.960 --> 42:47.960
They're metal pads.

42:47.960 --> 42:49.960
Normally we'd go for $200 a piece.

42:49.960 --> 42:51.960
I bought two for $187.

42:51.960 --> 42:53.960
Brand new.

42:53.960 --> 42:56.960
I guess they were expecting it to go higher.

42:56.960 --> 42:58.960
Also, personal message.

42:58.960 --> 43:00.960
I'm sure he's not listing, but...

43:00.960 --> 43:07.400
The person that goes by the name Aloha to you too, I beat your ass by $2 in 30 seconds.

43:07.400 --> 43:08.400
So there.

43:08.400 --> 43:13.560
A little fucker wanted to come and upbid me and thought, oh, I'm going to get the pads

43:13.560 --> 43:14.560
at the last minute.

43:14.560 --> 43:19.720
Well, I came in 30 seconds to close and threw up the bid at about another $2.

43:19.720 --> 43:21.920
You don't want to know about my eBay exploits.

43:21.920 --> 43:22.920
What'd you do?

43:22.920 --> 43:23.920
Just on every bid I do.

43:23.920 --> 43:27.160
If something that I didn't know was going to go for about $15, $20, 10 seconds before

43:27.160 --> 43:34.860
I ended up getting this Dojinshi for $30.

43:34.860 --> 43:35.860
It was worth it.

43:35.860 --> 43:37.440
It was a nice 70 page.

43:37.440 --> 43:38.440
Really nice.

43:38.440 --> 43:42.960
I bid $150 on it because I knew nobody would top it.

43:42.960 --> 43:47.920
The thing is, when people do stuff like that to me, I know how much it's worth.

43:47.920 --> 43:53.360
I'll bid up to about how much it's worth, so I'll knock up the bid another $100 on something

43:53.360 --> 43:55.360
I mean, that's not worth that much.

43:57.360 --> 43:58.360
Right on.

43:58.360 --> 44:02.360
Okay, well, what do you say? You guys want to take a break and we'll come back and do the FUs of the Week?

44:02.360 --> 44:03.360
We'll play more in others.

44:03.360 --> 44:07.360
You want to play more in others? Okay, we'll do more in others, and then we'll come back and do the FUs of the Week,

44:07.360 --> 44:11.360
because we heard Bob Lombardi give an FU of the Week to the police there in that segment.

44:11.360 --> 44:12.360
Fuck the police!

44:12.360 --> 44:13.360
Fuck the police!

44:13.360 --> 44:17.360
So, you know what, though? Well, we'll get into that during the FUs of the Week,

44:17.360 --> 44:22.360
because I have plenty of FUs that deal with the LA trip and things of that sort.

44:22.360 --> 44:25.360
Yes, do you feel not so fresh?

44:25.360 --> 44:32.360
Apparently, I constantly always have that not-so-fresh feeling, and I never knew why.

44:32.360 --> 44:33.360
Now you do.

44:33.360 --> 44:34.360
Now I do.

44:34.360 --> 44:35.360
Now you know, and knowing is half a battle.

44:35.360 --> 44:37.360
Thanks to my guardian angel.

44:37.360 --> 44:41.360
I still think that's so funny.

44:41.360 --> 44:42.360
It is funny.

44:42.360 --> 44:47.360
Alright, we'll be back.

49:47.360 --> 50:13.360
Orange Lounge Radio, we put your thing down, flip it and reverse it.

50:13.360 --> 50:22.640
I guess you heard that in Target the other day or something, Jamee?

50:22.640 --> 50:24.760
Yes, and I hate that type of music.

50:24.760 --> 50:27.320
I don't consider that music.

50:27.320 --> 50:28.320
You know what's funny?

50:28.320 --> 50:29.320
They were playing that at the club last night.

50:29.320 --> 50:33.920
I went out to the club to get my dance on, and they played this whole set of booty, new

50:33.920 --> 50:34.920
wave booty.

50:34.920 --> 50:38.800
Not the old stuff like you like, but the new wave booty music, like Lil' Kim, that song,

50:38.800 --> 50:43.200
And then that song that goes, my lips, my back, my pussy, and my track.

50:43.200 --> 50:47.400
Dude, no, when Johnny was over, he found that song and played it for us.

50:47.400 --> 50:49.640
And we were like going, turn that off.

50:49.640 --> 50:52.400
Melody made him turn it off.

50:52.400 --> 50:54.280
Did it make her ears bleed?

50:54.280 --> 50:56.240
It made me want to vomit.

50:56.240 --> 50:58.320
That song's funny.

50:58.320 --> 51:01.760
But it's just funny to watch all the clientele of the particular bar

51:01.760 --> 51:04.360
I would go to going, you know, they're like mouthing along to it.

51:04.360 --> 51:06.120
They'd go, my pussy, I'm not crazy.

51:06.120 --> 51:09.080
Everybody's mouth is funny.

51:09.080 --> 51:10.480
Anyway, yeah, hi.

51:10.480 --> 51:11.960
You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

51:11.960 --> 51:14.680
We occasionally talk about Bamani on this show when

51:14.680 --> 51:16.640
there's nothing better to talk about.

51:16.640 --> 51:17.400
Oh, yes, zero.

51:17.400 --> 51:20.600
I heard two little 12-year-old girls singing that song on the

51:20.600 --> 51:22.000
bus today.

51:22.000 --> 51:23.120
I'm not even joking.

51:23.120 --> 51:24.960
They're standing there on the bus doing it.

51:24.960 --> 51:27.680
I'm like, they know this by heart.

51:27.680 --> 51:29.480
They must have listened to it like 100 times just before

51:29.480 --> 51:30.200
they got on the bus.

51:30.200 --> 51:32.400
It was sad and scary all at the same time.

51:32.400 --> 51:33.960
You know what it was when I was a kid?

51:33.960 --> 51:35.960
Remember, you too can prevent skanks.

52:03.960 --> 52:18.960
Do you realize that people are still having sex, they've been told nuts, perhaps they are

52:18.960 --> 52:19.960
perplexed?

52:19.960 --> 52:23.960
When you see them holding hands, they're making future plans to engage in re-

52:23.960 --> 52:32.480
Speaking of bad remixes, I downloaded Slim Shady, and the background music was Billie

52:32.480 --> 52:38.480
I got a really bad one. No, this is fucking horrible. Listen to this. I just downloaded

52:38.480 --> 52:41.480
this the other day. This is the most fucking horrible thing I've ever heard in my life.

52:41.480 --> 52:42.480
No, I'll bring it next week.

52:42.480 --> 52:45.440
Okay. We're going to have to have like a, some kind of, maybe like a pre-show or sometime

52:45.440 --> 52:46.600
on the station we have to play.

52:46.600 --> 52:47.600
Worst remix ever.

52:47.600 --> 52:49.320
Really, really bad remixes.

52:49.320 --> 52:55.120
Nothing beats the Splat Attack, William Shatner techno mixes. Those are the most god-awful

52:55.120 --> 53:00.480
things you'll ever hear. The music's bad, and the samples are worse. It's just awful.

53:00.480 --> 53:04.060
listeners you might recognize a song from studio six dollars and how they rate

53:04.060 --> 53:11.060
this song

53:11.060 --> 53:17.060
And I'm the next one to fight It's the wrong party

53:17.060 --> 53:19.060
Who's the next one to fight?

53:19.060 --> 53:21.060
I'm gonna win this game!

53:21.060 --> 53:22.060
Come on!

53:22.060 --> 53:23.060
Woo!

53:23.060 --> 53:24.060
I'm gonna win this game!

53:24.060 --> 53:25.060
Come on!

53:25.060 --> 53:26.060
Come on!

53:26.060 --> 53:28.060
There are two different fucking keys!

53:28.060 --> 53:29.060
Okay?

53:29.060 --> 53:35.060
That was torture because, okay, I have a perfect sense of pitch.

53:35.060 --> 53:36.060
I'm a fan.

53:36.060 --> 53:39.060
I used to elbow people when their horns were out of tune.

53:39.060 --> 53:41.060
They'd go, okay, you're out of tune.

53:41.060 --> 53:47.060
And that, the dissonance in that was enough to make heads explode like in scanners.

53:47.060 --> 53:48.060
Okay?

53:48.060 --> 53:52.060
The very first thing the chat room goes, is that a twen mix?

53:52.060 --> 53:55.060
Chat room, I love you.

53:55.060 --> 54:01.060
Okay, I mean like who decided to mix Vincent D'amore and Whitney Houston, that's what I want to know.

54:01.060 --> 54:11.060
The worst thing I heard lately was that max 300 jump, I don't know who did it, but it's like it's a seven jump with max 300 and like they just laid them on top of each other.

54:11.060 --> 54:15.060
The worst one is this Mario, what was it, Mario Max?

54:15.060 --> 54:16.060
Oh yeah.

54:16.060 --> 54:21.060
And, and, and, and I could keep you know people were like, people, I swear to god there were people doing talkbacks and like these,

54:21.060 --> 54:28.060
so why can't there, anyone make any good remixes of Max 300 like Mario Max and, and this stuff and I'm like, Mar, what?

54:28.060 --> 54:36.060
It's awful. Awful shit. Don't mix anything from fourth mix with Max 300, it's just wrong.

54:36.060 --> 54:43.060
No, it was just horrible anyway. It was like, they'd cut, they'd stop Max, play some Mario, cut Mario, play some Max.

54:43.060 --> 54:45.060
Ew, is this for the tix?

54:49.060 --> 54:57.060
Ew. No, first of all, Whitney Houston needs to have her larynx pulled out so that we never have to hear from her again.

54:57.060 --> 55:05.060
Yeah, tell her to stop acting. I hated that fucking movie. My girlfriend made me watch it last night. Freaking bodyguard. The whole movie was about her bitching.

55:35.060 --> 55:37.600
Dolly Parton. Dolly Parton cried during that.

55:37.600 --> 55:40.840
Dolly Parton cries in the middle of it. I agree.

55:40.840 --> 55:45.100
There is no other version of that song. Bobby Brown needs to kill him.

55:45.100 --> 55:49.320
Only two versions of that song exist to me. Then again though, Dolly Parton did her share

55:49.320 --> 55:53.840
of butchering when it came to stairway. We don't talk about that. It doesn't exist.

55:53.840 --> 55:55.840
Okay. She still forgives Dolly Parton.

55:55.840 --> 55:58.480
There's two good versions of I Will Always Love You.

55:58.480 --> 56:02.040
Okay Whitney, Dolly Parton has her own theme park. How about you?

56:02.040 --> 56:04.400
It's not Skank Park, is there?

56:04.400 --> 56:05.400
There's...

56:05.400 --> 56:07.400
It's South Sacramento.

56:07.400 --> 56:10.520
It's South Sacramento.

56:10.520 --> 56:12.880
Two good versions of I Will Always Love You.

56:12.880 --> 56:17.240
Dolly Parton version, and the version the girl belts out the window in Hedvig.

56:17.240 --> 56:18.240
That's it.

56:18.240 --> 56:19.240
Yes.

56:19.240 --> 56:20.240
That is the best.

56:20.240 --> 56:22.880
You're the one done with the thick country accent.

56:22.880 --> 56:26.160
That was one of the highlights of my L.A. trip, I was getting to see Hedvig on stage.

56:26.160 --> 56:27.560
We're taking you next time.

56:27.560 --> 56:28.560
Irene and I want to go back.

56:28.560 --> 56:29.560
Why isn't Irene here tonight?

56:29.560 --> 56:30.560
She promised me she'd be here.

56:30.560 --> 56:33.080
I mean, if you're listening, you suck.

56:33.080 --> 56:35.080
Gum hella sucks.

56:35.080 --> 56:37.280
Hey, we have shrimp chips and you're missing out.

56:37.280 --> 56:44.280
Yeah, I have that CD that Brad wanted with all the Death Race songs on it.

56:44.680 --> 56:45.840
Death Race?

56:45.840 --> 56:49.280
Oh, Death Race, anyway.

56:49.280 --> 56:53.080
Okay, now that we've talked about horrible remixes, you want to get to the FUs of the week?

56:53.080 --> 56:54.940
Yeah.

56:54.940 --> 56:58.520
Since we might have some new people listening in tonight, because we have the

56:58.520 --> 57:00.120
Cyberbeat stuff, some

57:00.120 --> 57:03.160
people want to tune in to hear that tell the folks what the FUs of the week are all

57:03.160 --> 57:03.480
about

57:03.480 --> 57:07.680
we pick stuff that we hate and bitch about it

57:07.680 --> 57:14.040
that's about it

57:14.040 --> 57:22.040
this is fucked up

57:22.040 --> 57:25.400
well okay last night it was me and Tina

57:25.400 --> 57:28.920
and her sister in law we're all coming back from

57:28.920 --> 57:31.840
The Rocky cast meeting and we were gonna

57:34.520 --> 57:38.080
Now that was a surprise to me reading that you went back there

57:39.680 --> 57:43.760
Let it be I went to the good letter B. Good. Oh, yeah, okay, okay, who by the way?

57:43.760 --> 57:47.020
Fuck them for not sending me my free ice cream coupon yet. I'm gonna call and like

57:47.680 --> 57:49.680
tell their district manager and

57:50.320 --> 57:52.320
Bitch them out

57:52.320 --> 57:56.320
I know it looks sour, but anyways, we'll go.

57:56.320 --> 57:58.320
Yes! We got a good burp.

57:58.320 --> 58:02.320
That burp is dedicated to the leather visa envelope.

58:02.320 --> 58:06.320
And also this, you know, one was brought to you not by Propel,

58:06.320 --> 58:10.320
it was brought to you by Martinelli's Cranberry Apples Working Cider.

58:10.320 --> 58:12.320
Anyway, yeah.

58:12.320 --> 58:19.320
Anyway, um, this guy in the truck, I believe he's a guy who bought in on our great search for jahi.

58:19.320 --> 58:25.320
Um, we were, this truck was like, speeding up telling me, so you know what I did?

58:25.320 --> 58:27.320
You know what I did?

58:27.320 --> 58:28.320
You cut him off.

58:28.320 --> 58:31.320
I flew down to five miles an hour.

58:31.320 --> 58:34.320
And he couldn't pass me because there were cars coming.

58:34.320 --> 58:37.320
So I was a little bit cold.

58:37.320 --> 58:42.320
And then I saw him about to duck over to turn, so I cut right in front of him and turned.

58:42.320 --> 58:44.320
Right on to Madison.

58:44.320 --> 58:46.320
And I went another five miles an hour.

58:46.320 --> 58:48.320
He went to pass me, I cut him off.

58:48.320 --> 58:50.320
He went past me, I cut him off!

58:50.320 --> 58:56.320
And then, I drove off into the sunset or a road actually at 3 in the morning or something like that.

58:56.320 --> 58:59.320
Into the darkness, into the dark black forest.

58:59.320 --> 59:01.320
That's more appropriate for you, you drove off into the darkness.

59:01.320 --> 59:02.320
So...

59:02.320 --> 59:04.320
From whence you came.

59:04.320 --> 59:07.320
I was hoping that he would have drove past me so I could wave at him.

59:07.320 --> 59:10.320
I love to smell people when there's no traffic.

59:10.320 --> 59:12.320
Actually, it was more like more than one in the morning.

59:12.320 --> 59:14.320
Ah, so you're the bitch.

59:14.320 --> 59:18.320
Yeah, but fuck, no, he brought it on himself because he tailgated me, so fuck him.

59:18.320 --> 59:20.320
Yeah.

59:20.320 --> 59:24.320
I'd also like to say, um...

59:24.320 --> 59:27.320
You know what? I'm not really that angsty about anything else.

59:27.320 --> 59:34.320
There was this, like, scary person, though, that was at the grocery store.

59:34.320 --> 59:38.320
She was nice, but she was scary and wanted to talk to me.

59:38.320 --> 59:40.320
It was definite Dawn Syndrome.

59:40.320 --> 59:44.320
But I don't think anyone would get that much of a lesson that I need at rock n' roll.

59:45.320 --> 59:47.320
You know what I'm talking about.

59:48.320 --> 59:51.320
Disorderly and worthless nonsense.

59:51.320 --> 59:55.320
It's basically when people come up to you and start idle conversations about nothing.

59:55.320 --> 01:00:03.320
Like say for instance, you're standing in line with groceries or something and they're like, buying groceries, huh?

01:00:03.320 --> 01:00:05.320
You know, just stupid shit like that.

01:00:05.320 --> 01:00:11.320
I used to work there, like, I would do my internship in the morning when they were on air.

01:00:11.320 --> 01:00:16.320
And they would start doing that around the station, not even on their show.

01:00:16.320 --> 01:00:20.320
They would just start walking around doing it for no reason. It was actually pretty funny.

01:00:20.320 --> 01:00:26.320
But, yeah, that just gave me an idea for another F.U. I will hold on to it.

01:00:26.320 --> 01:00:34.320
Well, um, I need to retract my F.U. to my C.E. player, because now that I rigged it ghetto-style with paper,

01:00:34.320 --> 01:00:40.320
You know, my faceplate stays on, although I can't turn down the volume or go back to listen to a track again.

01:00:40.320 --> 01:00:41.320
Hooray, ghetto!

01:00:41.320 --> 01:00:42.320
Yay!

01:00:42.320 --> 01:00:51.320
Um, also, um, another F.U. of the week goes toward, um, the snack machine at my work.

01:00:51.320 --> 01:00:56.320
Because in the morning, if I forget to eat my breakfast, the only thing that I have to eat is the nutrient bar out of the snack machine.

01:00:56.320 --> 01:00:58.320
Our snack machine doesn't take dollars.

01:00:58.320 --> 01:01:03.320
Or if it takes the dollar, it tells you to use current change.

01:01:03.320 --> 01:01:07.320
It also doesn't take nickels, dimes, or quarters.

01:01:07.320 --> 01:01:08.320
So basically all that-

01:01:08.320 --> 01:01:09.320
And then he goes,

01:01:09.320 --> 01:01:10.320
Ah, I can't get it.

01:01:10.320 --> 01:01:12.320
Ugh.

01:01:12.320 --> 01:01:14.320
It doesn't take a decent piece of paper.

01:01:14.320 --> 01:01:17.320
Oh god.

01:01:17.320 --> 01:01:18.320
Yeah, I'm still-

01:01:18.320 --> 01:01:19.320
Fuck that.

01:01:19.320 --> 01:01:22.320
I'm on a new work schedule too, so fuck going to bed early.

01:01:22.320 --> 01:01:25.320
But I like getting out of work earlier, so yeah, that's it.

01:01:25.320 --> 01:01:27.320
Oh yeah, and fuck my back.

01:01:27.320 --> 01:01:28.320
Because my, um, shoulder-

01:01:28.320 --> 01:01:31.320
I put the muscle under my shoulder blade, and it hurt a lot.

01:01:31.320 --> 01:01:33.320
That's it.

01:01:33.320 --> 01:01:35.320
Perp.

01:01:35.320 --> 01:01:37.320
Dot com.

01:01:37.320 --> 01:01:39.320
Fartville.

01:01:41.320 --> 01:01:44.320
Um, not too angsty this week.

01:01:44.320 --> 01:01:46.320
No!

01:01:46.320 --> 01:01:48.320
I don't know, I've been just tired, so...

01:01:48.320 --> 01:01:50.320
No!

01:01:50.320 --> 01:01:54.320
Tired not getting out because I'm trying to save money, so I'm not angsty.

01:01:54.320 --> 01:01:57.320
Um, let's see here.

01:01:57.320 --> 01:02:00.320
Oh, F you to the stupid bitch at, uh, Raley's.

01:02:00.320 --> 01:02:06.480
any stupid whore um i don't want your fucking sample i've said to you before and i said to you again

01:02:06.480 --> 01:02:11.680
stop trying to give me the damn sample can she be a whore really who would pay for her i don't know

01:02:11.680 --> 01:02:16.640
she's ugly but anyways yeah she tried to give me the sample to my friend and it was like some

01:02:16.640 --> 01:02:22.480
taking rib on a stick and she dropped the fucking thing down down it slid down a little you know

01:02:22.480 --> 01:02:28.160
little cover there's like and then like fell into like a basket full of chips or something like that

01:02:28.160 --> 01:02:30.160
And said, oh, let me give you another one!

01:02:58.160 --> 01:03:09.160
So what do the people try to do? They try to cut between me and the 6-inch gap between the rail, when there's a nice 3 feet or more, probably like 6 feet on the other side of me.

01:03:09.160 --> 01:03:23.160
I mean, you... I think... I'm pretty convinced that everybody that works at VPD has no sense of, um... well, let's see, no common sense. They have no common sense whatsoever. They're like, oh, I was... what?

01:03:23.160 --> 01:03:31.160
F.U. to them. F.U. to stupid drivers because you're still out there. I hate you.

01:03:31.160 --> 01:03:39.160
And F.U. to everybody who watches Oprah because Oprah sucks.

01:03:39.160 --> 01:03:43.160
Don't talk about my mother like that.

01:03:43.160 --> 01:04:07.160
the other day, after the Michael Jackson interview thing, they were like doing a talk back on, like acting like they're experts on the whole, you know, subject and everything, and they absolutely had, I don't even think any of them watched the special, and they were just talking back for a good two hours about the damn thing. I just saw this and went, oh look, Jackass is still not talking about the current challenge of like, Vader's Jim or something like that. Stupid fucking people.

01:04:07.160 --> 01:04:16.160
umm, after you do the people in the Congo, I'm gonna fucking cast an Ebola spell on your whole country, so there.

01:04:16.160 --> 01:04:17.160
What are you gonna do now?

01:04:17.160 --> 01:04:18.160
I'm in another country.

01:04:18.160 --> 01:04:19.160
Haha, you can't touch me.

01:04:19.160 --> 01:04:20.160
Ehh.

01:04:20.160 --> 01:04:21.160
And you're gonna die.

01:04:21.160 --> 01:04:22.160
From Ebola.

01:04:22.160 --> 01:04:23.160
They'll cast rocket over the spell.

01:04:23.160 --> 01:04:28.160
Wuh-wuh-wuh-wuh-wuh-wuh-wuh-wuh-wuh!

01:04:28.160 --> 01:04:30.160
See, those- I weep for humanity.

01:04:30.160 --> 01:04:33.160
And these people that I weep, you know, probably weep.

01:04:33.160 --> 01:04:38.160
That and the whole fact that they're shutting down the Folsom Dam because of the threat of terrorism.

01:04:38.160 --> 01:04:45.160
Because, you know, people are going to come out of the middle of nowhere and just bomb the dam instead of, you know, bombing L.A., San Francisco, you know, one of the major cities.

01:04:45.160 --> 01:04:49.160
If the Folsom Dam could bomb, wouldn't it just flood the prison?

01:04:49.160 --> 01:04:52.160
It would flood Sacramento with 12 feet of water.

01:04:53.160 --> 01:04:55.160
Which I wouldn't miss it.

01:04:56.160 --> 01:04:58.160
That's where people might stop.

01:04:59.160 --> 01:05:01.160
I wouldn't miss Sacramento.

01:05:01.160 --> 01:05:03.160
I'd be up on the cliff going,

01:05:03.160 --> 01:05:05.160
Ah, the water's going down!

01:05:05.160 --> 01:05:06.160
Oh, you're drowning!

01:05:06.160 --> 01:05:09.160
As long as they give me advanced warning so I can get all my video game systems out of my house.

01:05:09.160 --> 01:05:12.160
Do you realize how much Loki is like Nelson from The Simpsons?

01:05:12.160 --> 01:05:14.160
Uh-huh!

01:05:14.160 --> 01:05:16.160
Oh, and the best one!

01:05:16.160 --> 01:05:18.160
I just laughed my ass off when I saw this.

01:05:18.160 --> 01:05:21.160
That'd be the stupid doctors that botched that fucking...

01:05:21.160 --> 01:05:25.160
That was hilarious.

01:05:25.160 --> 01:05:28.160
The thing was labeled correctly.

01:05:28.160 --> 01:05:29.160
A...

01:05:29.160 --> 01:05:30.160
Was it A, the...

01:05:30.160 --> 01:05:34.160
I don't know. The organs were A and the girl was O.

01:05:34.160 --> 01:05:37.160
There doesn't go anywhere in the same tube of credit.

01:05:37.160 --> 01:05:40.160
She'll throw her own block through the square hole.

01:05:40.160 --> 01:05:43.160
Were they Kaiser? They weren't Kaiser, were they?

01:05:43.160 --> 01:05:47.160
They're so stupid. They're like trying to save her. I'm like, dude, she's so dead.

01:05:50.160 --> 01:05:54.160
And they're like so surprised. Oh my god, she died! I can't believe it!

01:05:54.160 --> 01:05:57.160
So, check out how this happened!

01:05:57.160 --> 01:05:59.160
And there's her parents, though, who think,

01:05:59.160 --> 01:06:02.160
oh, well, we want a second opinion to say she's a little brain dead.

01:06:02.160 --> 01:06:04.160
Uh, let's see here.

01:06:04.160 --> 01:06:10.160
I mean, I feel bad for them that their daughter was lost due to incompetence.

01:06:10.160 --> 01:06:12.160
I don't know if they'll talk or anything, but she's not moving.

01:06:12.160 --> 01:06:17.160
But no brain, I don't see how you can simulate a lack of brain activity.

01:06:17.160 --> 01:06:19.160
Oh, well, she's brain dead.

01:06:19.160 --> 01:06:24.160
I don't know how you can get a sex unit to test that shows you're a brain activity.

01:06:24.160 --> 01:06:29.160
I mean, unless it's blind hope, blind faith, you know, wanting to grasp at anything.

01:06:30.160 --> 01:06:37.160
But the first step toward healing and grieving is realizing that you actually have something to grieve.

01:06:37.160 --> 01:06:39.160
We poached her with a stick, man. See you, Moo!

01:06:41.160 --> 01:06:42.160
Oh yeah, another thing.

01:06:42.160 --> 01:06:47.160
Effing the stupid people in Rhode Island that got caught in that stupid fire. I know you're all dead.

01:06:47.160 --> 01:06:49.160
Isn't that a great white concert?

01:06:49.160 --> 01:06:55.560
Hold on, hold on, hold on. I'm not going to cover probably what you're talking about.

01:06:55.560 --> 01:06:58.480
But it's hilarious because they're like, oh my god it's so tragic!

01:06:58.480 --> 01:07:01.680
Hello, they just used the one exit instead of the three fire exits that were built in

01:07:01.680 --> 01:07:02.280
this place.

01:07:02.280 --> 01:07:06.640
Oh! They're trying to get out the one door! Everyone's like, but there's exits over here

01:07:06.640 --> 01:07:10.480
marked fire exits in case of fire, like, that's happening right now!

01:07:10.480 --> 01:07:11.080
Oops.

01:07:11.080 --> 01:07:15.080
Yeah, I cried through humanity.

01:07:15.080 --> 01:07:25.080
It was a great white concert. Were they in sort of these fireworks that were illegal?

01:07:25.080 --> 01:07:28.080
I think it was half the audience.

01:07:28.080 --> 01:07:40.080
I have something to say about this. As long as we're joking about tragic events in the news, I have some things I'd like to say.

01:07:40.080 --> 01:07:46.900
okay f you to the band great white for setting that club on fire and killing a

01:07:46.900 --> 01:07:51.560
bunch of people because I had to wait 45 minutes to get into the club last night

01:07:51.560 --> 01:07:56.720
because they actually had to enforce the fire code because you dolts burn down a

01:07:56.720 --> 01:07:59.460
club on the other side of the country and I don't know if you've seen the

01:07:59.460 --> 01:08:02.760
video of this but like when the thing set on fire all these people are looking

01:08:02.760 --> 01:08:06.920
at the roof going dude I think there's something on fire if I thought the club

01:08:06.920 --> 01:08:10.840
was on fire when i stand there high off my ass going dude there's an 80s hair

01:08:10.840 --> 01:08:13.960
bevel no i would be high tailing it out the fucking door i

01:08:13.960 --> 01:08:17.960
killed one push and trample all you people

01:08:20.120 --> 01:08:23.240
and you know what the saddest thing about this whole thing is

01:08:23.240 --> 01:08:28.520
album sales are going to go through the roof for these guys pun intended

01:08:28.520 --> 01:08:32.600
great white is going to actually have a career again

01:08:32.600 --> 01:08:36.440
that's that's the real tragedy here ladies and gentlemen great white we'll

01:08:36.440 --> 01:08:43.440
bring the house down

01:08:48.680 --> 01:08:52.880
moving on my other refuse the week are out but slides on i five

01:08:52.880 --> 01:08:55.800
because because of mudslides on i five

01:08:55.800 --> 01:08:58.400
and i'm not talking about the drink i'm talking about the actual like but

01:08:58.400 --> 01:09:01.500
sliding down the hill and covering the freeway because of that

01:09:01.500 --> 01:09:03.800
we heard the traffic was blocked for hours

01:09:03.800 --> 01:09:09.500
So we had to go down 101 to get to LA. That took like seven and a half hours.

01:09:09.500 --> 01:09:10.880
I hated it.

01:09:10.880 --> 01:09:16.680
Well, no, I didn't hate it because, you know, we were with good company, so it was all good.

01:09:16.680 --> 01:09:19.200
Part of the countryside

01:09:19.200 --> 01:09:22.240
alongside the grapevine was on fire.

01:09:22.240 --> 01:09:25.780
Cool. We were stuck in traffic for three hours on the grapevine.

01:09:25.780 --> 01:09:30.000
And then we went by and saw helicopters and fire and I took pictures of it.

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:32.000
Great White playing there, too?

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:34.000
Oh, yes, no.

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:39.000
Alright, uh...

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:41.000
Also, what else is my F-use of the week?

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:43.000
Oh.

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:46.000
F... F-stupid children.

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:47.000
Yes!

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:49.000
You twit. Alright.

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:51.000
Remember, JB and I eat children. Children ramen.

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:53.000
Good, I have a... somebody you can go eat.

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:54.000
Okay.

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:57.000
No, we've been... we've come up with different flavors.

01:09:57.000 --> 01:10:03.000
There's RVGL flavor that tastes like skank, and then you know, scandia flavor, which is pretty crunchy in case.

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:06.000
The CCL flavor tastes like ass.

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:10.000
It should taste like sweat because this is what the place smells like.

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:14.000
It should taste like drugs and alcohol because this is what CCL is filled with.

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:18.000
Alright, speaking of zero, let's hear it. Your FUs of the Week, please.

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:28.000
Okay, I got a few. One is to the jackass over at Skandia who thought it would be a good idea to try to punk everybody out of their tokens on the machine.

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:48.000
He was like, I went up to go play a game, and there was a guy sitting up there, and he came up and tried to steal my Toki, and then he tried to yell at me and start a fight with me on the extreme machine.

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:59.000
And then, he went off and he like, got mad because he didn't get to play, which he was just about to take people's toes to do and start punching the carousel, thinking like, that's a good way to get rid of the stress.

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:09.000
And also, little kids who think there's a crosswalk across the DDR panels, it, it's pretty simple.

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:17.000
No, this is a raging epidemic in every arcade, I'm sure. Little kids who somehow see a crosswalk right there. I, what is up with that?

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:20.000
when i grabbed the little kid and took him to his parents?

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:25.000
Your child is going to end up with a broken foot if you don't watch your little kid.

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:28.000
Where to play VR?

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:30.000
I'll come back to this. Is this the U.S.A. mission mission?

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:33.000
The fourth mission in the corner.

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:37.000
and this little kid proceeds to walk across the machine or grab the kid and take it from his parents.

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:51.000
When I was in there and they had the little kids running across there, I looked at a friend of mine,

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:55.000
and I don't know who it was, and I said, is there a cross walking across the machine?

01:11:55.000 --> 01:12:01.000
And his kid's mom heard me, and his kid's mom heard me, and so excuse me, when I told him not to be doing that,

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:06.000
I wasn't even talking to you. I was just saying it like in general.

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:08.000
I was yelling at your child.

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:10.000
There were some kids I wish I could meet.

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:14.000
And also a big F.U. to the drunk lady in Scandinavia on Friday.

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:19.000
She was from Brazil, Texas, New York, and like Europe somewhere.

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:26.000
And she kept telling everybody how sexy they were and she was so bombed out and drugged.

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:27.000
It was pretty cool.

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:40.920
I went over there yesterday and I'm trying to pick out some soda to drink and this lady

01:12:40.920 --> 01:12:45.240
comes up trying to put soda in my cart trying to tell me that this is what you should get

01:12:45.240 --> 01:12:50.120
and this is what you should get and I was like no and she's like I ended up just leaving

01:12:50.120 --> 01:12:54.840
my cart and walking out of the store because she put like four 12 packs if I think after

01:12:54.840 --> 01:13:00.840
I told her no. And I was like, screw you, and I left. Because she was a bitch. And driver's force.

01:13:24.840 --> 01:13:26.600
because there was

01:13:26.600 --> 01:13:29.280
someone who was incredibly rude to her

01:13:29.280 --> 01:13:29.920
but

01:13:29.920 --> 01:13:32.400
they'll give you all these lines and then they try to sell you back

01:13:32.400 --> 01:13:33.860
so finally I looked over at the guy

01:13:33.860 --> 01:13:38.460
he says yeah I'm doing a communication project and by the way you know I just want to talk to all the

01:13:38.460 --> 01:13:40.320
pretty women in the part of the way

01:13:40.320 --> 01:13:42.480
first of all I don't want to buy magazines

01:13:42.480 --> 01:13:44.080
oh you've already talked to somebody

01:13:44.080 --> 01:13:47.680
no but my friend has and quite honestly no money belongs to money in my damn pocket

01:13:47.680 --> 01:13:50.520
not in yours

01:13:50.520 --> 01:13:51.520
and he's just like

01:13:51.520 --> 01:13:55.520
don't you want to buy one i'm like no i'm not nice leave so he left

01:13:57.600 --> 01:14:03.120
another one back to ccl that's right when they thought like they tell everyone that

01:14:03.120 --> 01:14:08.240
their pads were all in good condition why did i feel like i on doubles heavy like in the middle

01:14:08.240 --> 01:14:13.200
of the song because none of the right pad work and the stupid little rabbit girl who like would not

01:14:13.200 --> 01:14:19.200
I like, seriously, if I was a girl who would be a rad boy, she'd be like, I don't know,

01:14:19.200 --> 01:14:23.200
but I'm just very, I just get mad.

01:14:23.200 --> 01:14:27.200
She was stepping on her foot when you were born.

01:14:27.200 --> 01:14:30.200
She knocked away.

01:14:30.200 --> 01:14:34.200
All right, let's move on to the chatroom FUs, shall we?

01:14:34.200 --> 01:14:35.200
Play happy music.

01:14:35.200 --> 01:14:38.200
Brace yourself, there's a ton.

01:14:38.200 --> 01:14:42.720
Muhymer says fuck word problems fuck winter storms that lead to flooding of the massive sort

01:14:42.900 --> 01:14:48.120
Fuck my school for saying that school was canceled Thursday because of snow and then deciding to change their minds a full day the night before

01:14:48.680 --> 01:14:53.660
Fuck my dad for still not getting cable so I can have wireless with my laptop and download muchos DDR stuff

01:14:53.660 --> 01:14:58.800
Sad face fuck my heater for breaking also and fuck the new one for causing my allergies to annihilate me

01:14:59.360 --> 01:15:04.440
Yeah, evil now key to DX says a fuck you to people who don't know how to follow forum rules

01:15:34.440 --> 01:15:40.440
It's really sad, but it's a remix, so it doesn't really count.

01:15:40.440 --> 01:15:42.440
It's not really hard, then.

01:15:42.440 --> 01:15:44.440
Yeah, exactly.

01:15:44.440 --> 01:15:46.440
Hey, hack on, nephew.

01:15:46.440 --> 01:15:55.440
RiceRyc3 says, Fuck you, Gray Davis, for cutting the funds for my school. I need my damn classes to transfer ASAP.

01:15:55.440 --> 01:16:02.440
the

01:16:04.440 --> 01:16:07.280
you know folks that college is completely useless and was a waste of

01:16:07.280 --> 01:16:10.880
money all the people that get out of college end up coming to work at my

01:16:10.880 --> 01:16:11.680
uh... work

01:16:11.680 --> 01:16:13.460

01:16:15.480 --> 01:16:18.600
right right going to call for a specific to the fucking boring a waste of my

01:16:18.600 --> 01:16:19.880
money

01:16:19.880 --> 01:16:21.260
and i'm

01:16:21.260 --> 01:16:24.080
maybe not as much as they are but you know what they got to pay back his

01:16:24.080 --> 01:16:29.720
college loans so technically I'm above them the one advantage of having going

01:16:29.720 --> 01:16:32.760
to college at least for three years is the companies when they hire you they

01:16:32.760 --> 01:16:36.920
do have to hire you for a little bit more if you had like two or more years

01:16:36.920 --> 01:16:42.640
of college three yeah now what if I got screwed at my company cuz I've had three

01:16:42.640 --> 01:16:45.220
even though I don't don't have a piece of paper to show it anyway

01:16:45.220 --> 01:16:49.520
deaf square says fuck everybody who doesn't like oatmeal raisin cookies

01:16:49.520 --> 01:16:56.000

01:17:15.840 --> 01:17:19.000
servers it probably brought down live journal the other day actually a denial

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:22.000
The denial of service attack brought down LiveJournal. Fuck people that do that.

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:23.000
Jesus.

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:27.000
You know what denial of service attack is? That's when you get all the computers

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:33.000
that ping a server like Yahoo or CNN or whatever to try and take it down, to overload it and take it down.

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:35.000
That's what happened to LiveJournal the other day.

01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:38.000
But you know they credited all the paid users with four extra days because of it.

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:39.000
Really?

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:40.000
Okay, I didn't notice.

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:41.000
Yep, they did.

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:43.000
Nice pay-through June anyway.

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:45.000

01:18:28.720 --> 01:18:32.680
that is so weird and i thought zero period meant

01:18:32.680 --> 01:18:35.720
it was i thought zero this 23rd magazine zero

01:18:35.720 --> 01:18:40.900
zero period was called zero period because it was before first period

01:18:40.900 --> 01:18:42.160
or you know

01:18:42.160 --> 01:18:45.040
well i guess it depends i guess it depends like our schools didn't have a

01:18:45.040 --> 01:18:48.680
home we didn't have

01:18:48.680 --> 01:18:52.600
anything is it is it is against the law for them to deny you your lunch time so

01:18:52.600 --> 01:18:53.960
you know what you need to do

01:18:53.960 --> 01:18:57.760
you need to find whatever documentation you have on that

01:18:57.760 --> 01:19:01.400
send it not only to the school board but to the PTA

01:19:01.400 --> 01:19:04.900

Oh, thank you. I don't have a heart, though. I have a lump of coal, like spermet.

You do, it's just black!

01:20:03.980 --> 01:20:05.980
I have a love of coal, like Smurfette.

01:20:06.980 --> 01:20:11.980
And if you don't remember, when Smurfette showed up, she had black hair and had a heart of coal.

01:20:11.980 --> 01:20:13.980
Okay, this is what 23rd Magus is elaborating.

01:20:13.980 --> 01:20:15.980
Then they elaborated and she became good.

01:20:15.980 --> 01:20:17.980
Okay, 23rd Magus is answering some of your questions here.

01:20:17.980 --> 01:20:23.980
Okay, he can't go before school, can't make it, for whatever reason, so he has to go during lunch, which means he cannot eat.

01:20:23.980 --> 01:20:26.980
Either I give up lunch or I give up graduating.

01:20:26.980 --> 01:20:28.980
I don't buy it, take it to the PTA.

01:20:28.980 --> 01:20:35.980

you people you people are raping this privilege all right

01:21:49.900 --> 01:21:53.420
here we go snub this annoyed says big old fat f you that's an understatement

01:21:53.420 --> 01:21:56.980
here, too. First off, fuck you to the people at CCL who decided that just because someone

01:21:56.980 --> 01:21:59.860
stringed the machine for tons of credits, it was okay to hog the machine like a bunch

01:21:59.860 --> 01:22:03.840
of motherfuckers. I had to wait 90 minutes for one fucking game of DDR and it was versus

01:22:03.840 --> 01:22:08.940
with some pretentious and not very good little... The blanket is blank. Even I... That's too

01:22:08.940 --> 01:22:11.940
dirty for me to read.

01:22:11.940 --> 01:22:15.700
Oh my God.

01:22:15.700 --> 01:22:20.860
Little cum in his shit asshole. It made me play on the two-player pads which sucked Major

01:22:20.860 --> 01:22:36.860
Secondly, fuck you to CCL for not fixing the two-player pads for so long. I understand that it's hard to repair the pads when people string the machine so excessively, but it's been about two months now and the down and right arrows don't work unless you weigh 400 pounds, so fuck them for having such shitty pads.

01:22:36.860 --> 01:22:43.860
okay well i've never met that doesn't know what you're wearing out

01:22:52.260 --> 01:22:53.860

01:23:00.980 --> 01:23:03.300
when cameras

01:23:03.300 --> 01:23:06.300
They're like those fake ones you buy at the store, the candy cameras.

01:23:07.300 --> 01:23:15.300
They have them. All you can see, though, are like the lights of the speakers and the talk. You can't see anywhere down on the bottom.

01:23:15.300 --> 01:23:19.300
They're saying clips that people usually try to be honest and they think they're being watched.

01:23:19.300 --> 01:23:20.300
Very true.

01:23:22.300 --> 01:23:27.300
Third, fuck the dumb little bitches that decided to drive on the shoulder in their Mustang and then merge with traffic.

01:23:27.300 --> 01:23:29.300
Somebody did that to me the other day. I hate that.

01:23:29.300 --> 01:23:33.300
Almost fucking slamming into us. I hate to call anyone a bitch, but they fucking deserved it.

01:23:33.300 --> 01:23:37.300
And after almost slamming into us, they laughed like giddy-ass schoolgirls. Fuck you.

01:23:39.300 --> 01:23:42.300
You know, I have an execution on that. Fuck big trucks.

01:23:42.300 --> 01:23:44.300
Who tried to run you off the road?

01:23:46.300 --> 01:23:47.300
Yeah.

01:23:47.300 --> 01:23:51.300
And finally, fuck you to the Queen Kong gorilla girl that fucking butchered my hair.

01:23:51.300 --> 01:23:54.300
If my hair slips through your fingers, don't cut my fucking hair, please.

01:23:54.300 --> 01:23:56.040
Please I asked for a trim

01:23:56.040 --> 01:24:01.580
So I don't look like a hobo while keeping my sort of sideburns and I get half my fucking hair shaved off

01:24:01.580 --> 01:24:07.300
I don't have sideburns and my head looked like a fucking mushroom for three weeks. Fuck that. Well, there you go

01:24:07.300 --> 01:24:09.300
Did you see anyone that look like a mushroom zero?

01:24:10.060 --> 01:24:12.060
I

01:24:12.060 --> 01:24:21.260
I think this is a new person listening to the show, so hello to Ninja Usaki Koi, which

01:24:21.260 --> 01:24:23.260
means bunny, does it?

01:24:23.260 --> 01:24:29.020
Yes, either that's koyos in love or koyos in fish.

01:24:29.020 --> 01:24:30.500
What about Usaki, is that bunny?

01:24:30.500 --> 01:24:31.500
Is that bunny love?

01:24:31.500 --> 01:24:32.500
Ninja Bunny love?

01:24:32.500 --> 01:24:33.500
Ninja Bunny love.

01:24:33.500 --> 01:24:34.500
Awesome.

01:24:34.500 --> 01:24:35.500
That's cool.

01:24:35.500 --> 01:24:39.620
I love my, my sister would love you because my sister is a total bunny addict.

01:24:39.620 --> 01:24:58.620
I want to send an F.U. to my friend for playing Involuntary Twister with me on DDR.

01:24:58.620 --> 01:25:02.900
JB says my F.U. goes to SyFam having to be in Italy so it will take forever for my customized

01:25:02.900 --> 01:25:04.300
CD order form to get there.

01:25:04.300 --> 01:25:08.300
and FU to the Safari Trance mix for Jamie sounding blah.

01:25:08.300 --> 01:25:11.300
Send it to me anyway. Send me what you have Safari.

01:25:11.300 --> 01:25:15.300
If you can't mix Safari to Trance, it doesn't work. It's like Jungle in the Trance.

01:25:15.300 --> 01:25:20.300
Actually, I want to make a suggestion for a new monthly contest.

01:25:20.300 --> 01:25:22.300
What's that? We haven't even finished the rules for our other one.

01:25:22.300 --> 01:25:27.300
Let's finish this one though, but I have a really good idea. Finish it like we first did.

01:25:27.300 --> 01:25:28.300
OK.

01:25:28.300 --> 01:25:32.300
Vidpowah says, FU to Cartoon Heroes for being hard. I agree.

01:25:32.300 --> 01:25:36.220
F you to teachers who yell at your class when you haven't done anything wrong.

01:25:36.220 --> 01:25:37.220
F you to homework.

01:25:37.220 --> 01:25:38.220
F you to research papers.

01:25:38.220 --> 01:25:41.860
And finally, F you to people who vandalize apartments that your family owns.

01:25:41.860 --> 01:25:44.700
Luckily, no one lives in those apartments.

01:25:44.700 --> 01:25:48.260
Too much crime in Vegas.

01:25:48.260 --> 01:25:50.580
The OSFBB says fuck you to every new program.

01:25:50.580 --> 01:25:54.820
For some reason, they always find the stupidest fucking person to talk to.

01:25:54.820 --> 01:25:56.460
Okay.

01:25:56.460 --> 01:25:58.020
Okay.

01:25:58.020 --> 01:26:05.020
and

01:26:08.700 --> 01:26:10.700
and

01:26:10.700 --> 01:26:15.700
even though he is one of the people who don't know what being a true friend is

01:26:15.700 --> 01:26:22.700
yeah

01:26:22.700 --> 01:26:29.540
Well, I'll tell you my suggestion during one of the breaks, and we'll see if it's...

01:26:29.540 --> 01:26:30.540
Okay, we'll do that.

01:26:30.540 --> 01:26:32.540
In fact, we'll go ahead and take a quick break right now.

01:26:32.540 --> 01:26:36.820
I'm going to bring up some shirt that Yosef Vibi gave me a site, and we'll look at that

01:26:36.820 --> 01:26:38.460
during the break, too.

01:26:38.460 --> 01:26:42.460
And we got the second half of the Cyberbeat stuff, the post-Freestyle interview is coming

01:26:42.460 --> 01:26:43.460
up.

01:26:43.460 --> 01:26:44.880
Those should be very interesting.

01:26:44.880 --> 01:26:48.140
In the meantime, we're going to take a quick break, and we'll start it off with, I don't

01:26:48.140 --> 01:26:49.140
know, what?

01:26:49.140 --> 01:26:50.140
What should we hear, Jamie?

01:26:50.140 --> 01:26:51.140
You know what?

01:26:51.140 --> 01:26:55.140
Um, you know what? How about in celebration of my very first seven star?

01:26:55.140 --> 01:26:56.140
Oh, okay.

01:26:56.140 --> 01:26:57.140
Please don't go.

01:26:57.140 --> 01:27:01.140
Oh, god, I hope I have it. Uh, I know I do. I know I do. I know I do.

01:27:01.140 --> 01:27:03.140
I know I do somewhere.

01:27:03.140 --> 01:27:04.140
Okay, we'll do that.

01:27:04.140 --> 01:27:05.140
Alright.

01:27:05.140 --> 01:27:07.140
Alright, we'll be back

01:27:35.140 --> 01:27:39.140
but this is how I grew up

01:27:39.140 --> 01:27:42.140
I got to let it be

01:27:43.140 --> 01:27:45.140
I got to let it be

01:27:46.140 --> 01:27:49.140
Oh yeah, let it be

01:27:50.140 --> 01:27:52.140
I got to let it be

01:27:52.140 --> 01:27:54.140
I got to let it be

01:27:54.140 --> 01:27:56.140
I'm overrated

01:27:56.140 --> 01:27:58.140

01:27:58.140 --> 01:28:01.140

I want to see what the really bad ones are.

01:33:47.140 --> 01:33:53.360
These are the bad ones.

01:33:53.360 --> 01:33:58.900
I used to listen to NSYNC when they were in Underground.

01:33:58.900 --> 01:34:00.140
Homosexuals are gay.

01:34:00.140 --> 01:34:05.140
You fucked my mother?

01:34:05.140 --> 01:34:09.140
I want the shirt that says, Even Jesus Hates Creed.

01:34:09.140 --> 01:34:10.740
I like that, Even Jesus Hates Creed.

01:34:10.740 --> 01:34:13.260
That's great.

01:34:13.260 --> 01:34:14.460
Guns don't kill people.

01:34:14.460 --> 01:34:15.500
Mario Van Peebles.

Ooh, it's purple.

01:34:29.540 --> 01:34:33.180

01:35:24.840 --> 01:35:28.860

old church.

01:36:23.140 --> 01:36:24.140

I shit my pants and all I got is a lovely t-shirt.

01:37:08.180 --> 01:37:09.180
Broken cotton.

01:37:09.180 --> 01:37:11.180
That's awful!

01:37:11.180 --> 01:37:13.180
Are you kidnapped?

01:37:13.180 --> 01:37:16.180
Are you my daddy?

01:37:16.180 --> 01:37:18.180
I keep these bigger than yours.

01:37:18.180 --> 01:37:21.180
I hide in my crack in my diaper.

01:37:21.180 --> 01:37:24.180

01:37:24.180 --> 01:37:26.180

Oh my God. Alright alright alright alright.

01:37:28.180 --> 01:37:31.180

01:37:36.180 --> 01:37:37.180
Big Black Calk.

01:37:37.180 --> 01:37:39.180
You wanna talk about the contest now or are we gonna wait until we wrap up the other contest?

01:37:39.180 --> 01:37:41.180
We're gonna wrap up the contest first though, right?

01:37:41.180 --> 01:37:43.180
We should start it next month I think.

01:37:43.180 --> 01:37:47.180
We're going to have the remix challenge.

01:37:47.180 --> 01:37:56.020
Where we give you a song, and we give you a style, and you need to remix the song in

01:37:56.020 --> 01:37:57.740
the style.

01:37:57.740 --> 01:38:02.940
And we will give points to people, and we're going to have this running for a whole year.

01:38:02.940 --> 01:38:03.940
Okay?

01:38:03.940 --> 01:38:05.900
So we're going to hear all kinds of neat stuff.

01:38:05.900 --> 01:38:09.620
You have a month to finish your particular mix.

01:38:09.620 --> 01:38:13.040
Like the one, the last challenge that I gave out, we'll go ahead and extend it.

01:38:13.040 --> 01:38:14.540
The Safari Trance mix.

01:38:14.540 --> 01:38:15.540
Sick.

01:38:15.540 --> 01:38:20.540
You know, we could do Remember Me, Happy Hardcore.

01:38:20.540 --> 01:38:22.540
Or not.

01:38:22.540 --> 01:38:23.540
How about a good song?

01:38:23.540 --> 01:38:26.540
No, actually, on 2DX, that's a favorite song of mine to play, actually.

01:38:26.540 --> 01:38:27.540
It's Remember You.

01:38:27.540 --> 01:38:29.540
Although it is really, really, really easy.

01:38:29.540 --> 01:38:30.540
Not Remember You, Remember Me.

01:38:30.540 --> 01:38:31.540
Oh, I don't remember.

01:38:31.540 --> 01:38:33.540
But it'll be.

01:38:33.540 --> 01:38:34.540
That really slow one.

01:38:34.540 --> 01:38:36.540
Yeah, you know which song I'm talking about.

01:38:36.540 --> 01:38:39.540
It's fun to play, although it is really insanely easy.

01:38:39.540 --> 01:38:41.540
It's just kind of, I don't know, it's a good, it's fun to play.

01:38:41.540 --> 01:38:42.540
But DDR, no.

01:38:42.540 --> 01:38:43.540
It's awful on DDR.

01:38:43.540 --> 01:38:47.060
But we'll offer this.

01:38:47.060 --> 01:38:50.500
We're going to give out points based on how well your mix is.

01:38:50.500 --> 01:38:53.060
Whoever has the best, the highest number of points

01:38:53.060 --> 01:38:55.340
at the end of the year gets a fabulous prize.

01:38:55.340 --> 01:38:56.920
And I'm not talking about a shit prize.

01:38:56.920 --> 01:38:58.540
I'm talking about fabulous.

01:38:58.540 --> 01:39:00.220
We don't know what kind of fabulous prize.

01:39:00.220 --> 01:39:01.780
Well, I mean, it is a year away.

01:39:01.780 --> 01:39:03.460
If we put up enough money, you can

01:39:03.460 --> 01:39:06.980
get one of those nice DJ in the boxes for like $400 or $300.

01:39:06.980 --> 01:39:08.980
And it's got two turntables and a mixing board.

01:39:08.980 --> 01:39:09.480
Fuck that.

01:39:09.480 --> 01:39:12.380
If I'm buying one of those, I'm buying it for me.

01:39:12.380 --> 01:39:15.380
I was hoping it was going to be for me, but whatever. Anyways, yeah.

01:39:15.380 --> 01:39:19.380
Yes, and even hosts can participate, because I'm grading.

01:39:19.380 --> 01:39:23.380
So it's all going to be Jamie grading? So I can enter the remixes?

01:39:23.380 --> 01:39:24.380
It'll be me and a panel.

01:39:24.380 --> 01:39:28.380
Oh, okay. You and a panel. A panel of what?

01:39:28.380 --> 01:39:31.380
Can you get negative scores?

01:39:31.380 --> 01:39:34.380
If it's really bad, yeah. If it's twin, yeah.

01:39:34.380 --> 01:39:37.380
I was waiting for someone to say that.

01:39:37.380 --> 01:39:40.380
I wonder if you can get negative scores, because mine's so bad.

01:39:40.380 --> 01:39:43.380
I don't know. I've heard pretty bad. We've heard pretty bad.

01:39:43.380 --> 01:39:46.380
But anyway, we'll start this up next month.

01:39:46.380 --> 01:39:50.380
But first we've got to finish the rules for our DWI contest we're going to be doing.

01:39:50.380 --> 01:39:52.380
That's still going on too.

01:39:52.380 --> 01:39:58.380
That's still going on, but we really haven't announced the official rules because we've been lazy and out of town and what have you, drunk, whatever.

01:39:58.380 --> 01:40:01.380
But we'll have the full details on that next week, we swear.

01:40:01.380 --> 01:40:07.380
The DWI contest where all the DWIs must be to old school TV themes.

01:40:07.380 --> 01:40:15.380
yes no remixes no movies just TV themes didn't we say we were gonna allow movies

01:40:15.380 --> 01:40:20.420
I don't know okay no movies well we'll have the full rules for you next week

01:40:20.420 --> 01:40:23.820
I'm personally looking forward to seeing one done to the greatest American hero

01:40:23.820 --> 01:40:29.420
not that you're hinting what's going to get your vote

01:40:29.420 --> 01:40:33.420
I'm actually going to vote for it.

01:40:33.420 --> 01:40:35.420
It should be excluded.

01:40:35.420 --> 01:40:36.420
Shut up.

01:40:36.420 --> 01:40:37.420
Shut up, Intern.

01:40:37.420 --> 01:40:38.420
You're for fun.

01:40:38.420 --> 01:40:39.420
Shut up, Intern.

01:40:39.420 --> 01:40:41.660
Oh, so now Zero X is the official Intern of...

01:40:41.660 --> 01:40:42.660
He's our Intern.

01:40:42.660 --> 01:40:43.660
Okay, cool.

01:40:43.660 --> 01:40:44.660
Because Black Lab is...

Yes, our PR bitch.

01:40:51.820 --> 01:40:53.660
And so now we have Zero as our Intern.

01:40:53.660 --> 01:40:55.620
Who else do we have to have a title on this show?

01:40:55.620 --> 01:40:56.620
Dave's our mascot.

01:40:56.620 --> 01:40:57.620
Dave's our mascot.

01:40:57.620 --> 01:40:58.620
Who else?

01:40:58.620 --> 01:41:08.580

01:41:08.580 --> 01:41:14.080

01:41:14.080 --> 01:41:19.400
whore yes speaking of which should we get into the cage match now or do we

01:41:19.400 --> 01:41:23.160
want to do the second half of the clip okay we'll do we'll do the cage match

01:41:23.160 --> 01:41:25.720
then we'll come back and do the second half of the interviews while we tally

01:41:25.720 --> 01:41:52.720
Well, we play songs. Each of us picks one. Whichever one went last week, of course, the person who chose that song does not get to choose a new one. And you, the chatroom, vote on what you think is best and it goes into rotation for a week.

01:41:52.720 --> 01:41:55.420
goes irritation during our money is more

01:41:55.420 --> 01:41:57.660
yeah always on this channel we're not here

01:41:57.660 --> 01:41:58.940
in the front going

01:41:58.940 --> 01:42:02.080
implore or i did a fuck-up this week for the first time in like two weeks

01:42:02.080 --> 01:42:05.520
so was a little too you know what i would like to meet with

01:42:05.520 --> 01:42:09.560
yeah you're you're you are a fuck-up or for a while

01:42:09.560 --> 01:42:12.800
we just like

01:42:12.800 --> 01:42:15.640
last week on orange lunch radio okay so let's

01:42:15.640 --> 01:42:19.680
get into the cage match

01:42:19.680 --> 01:42:21.140
last week

01:42:21.140 --> 01:42:23.700
on the cage match, actually two weeks ago.

01:42:23.700 --> 01:42:27.560
But you guys didn't do a cage match last week I'm assuming?

01:42:27.560 --> 01:42:31.580
OK, so last time we did the cage match, so by default, the winner from two weeks ago

01:42:31.580 --> 01:42:34.520
won last week just by default. There was no cage match.

01:42:34.520 --> 01:42:39.520
So this is two weeks in a row now, going for its third victory.

01:42:39.520 --> 01:42:44.460
And, honestly, between you and me, I think this is going to be the first song that has to be retired

01:42:44.460 --> 01:42:48.900
after four weeks. I just think it's gonna, just because it happens to be a host

01:42:48.900 --> 01:42:54.740
involved with the creation of it I don't think it's ever gonna lose but boost my

01:42:54.740 --> 01:42:59.340
ego some more that's enough you don't need no more but we have some we have

01:42:59.340 --> 01:43:04.100
some worthy challengers tonight you know why this is what we decided to do I think

01:43:04.100 --> 01:43:12.540
Jamie did this too right we let other people pick our songs this week yep so

01:43:12.540 --> 01:43:18.820
other people picked our songs for this week so anyway let's talk about last

01:43:18.820 --> 01:43:22.620
last week's winner. This is the first song that you can vote for. Oh yeah, after we play

01:43:22.620 --> 01:43:26.580
we will not accept votes until the end of the third song. Once the end of the third

01:43:26.580 --> 01:43:30.220
song is reached and we tell you to send in your votes, you can send me a private message

01:43:46.340 --> 01:43:51.540
week two weeks ago is winner this is Loki with the legend of trance we're

01:43:51.540 --> 01:43:58.540
just gonna play a small clip of it.

01:44:51.540 --> 01:45:10.380
Alright, that's last week's winner from two weeks ago, that's the Legend of Trance, kind

01:45:10.380 --> 01:45:12.660
of a remix of Legend of Max.

01:45:12.660 --> 01:45:16.820
And Loki, why don't you explain how that was created for those that are just joining us,

01:45:16.820 --> 01:45:17.820
never heard that one before?

01:45:17.820 --> 01:45:21.060
That was all with Acid 3 Pro.

01:45:21.060 --> 01:45:23.780
And what possessed you to make that mix?

01:45:23.780 --> 01:45:27.260
I don't know, I don't know, I just wanted to make a remix of something and I was like

01:45:27.260 --> 01:45:28.580
eh, I'll try that.

01:45:28.580 --> 01:45:29.580
I want a sip.

01:45:29.580 --> 01:45:30.580
I want a sip.

01:45:30.580 --> 01:45:31.580
Of it.

01:45:31.580 --> 01:45:32.580
Because I haven't tried this yet.

01:45:32.580 --> 01:45:33.580
Yes, I don't know.

01:45:33.580 --> 01:45:34.580
It just, I thought about doing that.

01:45:34.580 --> 01:45:40.460
I'm working on either, now I was trying to do a Dynamite Rave one, something like that.

01:45:40.460 --> 01:45:44.540
Something trancy, but it's just not, it's not very, it just doesn't work.

01:45:44.540 --> 01:45:46.220
It's not sounding too good.

01:45:46.220 --> 01:45:53.220
So I'm looking at right now, probably going to be doing a Dark Black Forest one, and there

01:45:53.220 --> 01:45:57.820
was another one I was looking at doing. I can't remember. Oh, the Dark Black Forest

01:45:57.820 --> 01:46:00.420
was one of them, though, for sure.

01:46:00.420 --> 01:46:06.060
All right. Next up, let's play my pick for this week. However, my pick is actually coming

01:46:06.060 --> 01:46:10.940
from someone else this week, because I knew nothing I picked was going to be Loki's winner

01:46:10.940 --> 01:46:15.940
from a couple weeks ago. So Dark Tetsuya wanted me to put this one in. It's one of his favorite

01:46:15.940 --> 01:46:33.940
Love of the Angel

01:46:45.940 --> 01:47:04.940
The stories ending, they will take my life Saying you can never, are fighting in my mind

01:47:04.940 --> 01:47:09.940
I'm missing love, believe me I'm with someone

01:47:09.940 --> 01:47:13.940
Wish you loved me, oh pretty girl

01:47:13.940 --> 01:47:16.940
Why you expect to fall in love

01:47:16.940 --> 01:47:18.940
You take me to the store

01:47:18.940 --> 01:47:21.940
You cover the edges

01:47:21.940 --> 01:47:25.940
Like a bright light in my mind

01:47:25.940 --> 01:47:28.940
You're taking my life

01:47:28.940 --> 01:47:32.940
To the top to feel alright

01:48:02.940 --> 01:48:11.940
I'm taking my life

01:48:11.940 --> 01:48:39.220
p0k3smot42o

01:48:39.220 --> 01:48:42.220
Sorry about that. Well, the interviews are all queued up now.

01:48:42.220 --> 01:48:44.220
We'll get to that after the gauge votes.

01:48:44.220 --> 01:48:49.220
Alright, that was KK, KK, Jungle Girls, I don't remember their full name.

01:48:49.220 --> 01:48:50.220
Kong.

01:48:50.220 --> 01:48:52.220
DJ Kong, thank you.

01:48:52.220 --> 01:48:55.220
King Kong and Jungle Girls, with Love of the Angel.

01:48:55.220 --> 01:48:57.220
The Jungle Girls.

01:48:57.220 --> 01:49:01.220
That wasn't a bad tune, I liked it. Let's go around and see everybody else's thoughts.

01:49:01.220 --> 01:49:02.220
6.

01:49:02.220 --> 01:49:04.220
Sorry, we had the music full volume there. Sorry about that.

01:49:04.220 --> 01:49:06.220
Let's go around and get everyone else's thoughts on that song.

01:49:06.220 --> 01:49:10.220
80's Fabulous, but not 80's Fabulous Enough.

01:49:11.220 --> 01:49:21.220
I don't know, I give it a 7. It was pretty good for what it was supposed to sound like, but it wasn't nothing that really caught my eye.

01:49:22.220 --> 01:49:28.220
6. He should have called himself King Dong and His Bitches. He would have gotten a higher score that way.

01:49:28.220 --> 01:49:34.220
I'd actually go ahead and give it an 8 because I think it'll be a pretty decent DDR song. It'll be pretty cool in DDR.

01:49:34.220 --> 01:49:40.220
And, uh, you know, I have a feeling, just because there's some meanings behind this for some folks at Chaurum,

01:49:40.220 --> 01:49:45.220
there might be some votes coming at this way for Love of the Angels, so, who knows?

01:49:45.220 --> 01:49:51.220
I think they're trying to- I think they're- they're trying everything they can to dethrone Legend of Trance.

01:49:51.220 --> 01:49:57.220
Alright, oh. Jamie's gonna bring it. Alright, Jamie, what are you bringing to the cage match tonight?

01:49:57.220 --> 01:50:03.220
Alright, this was my favorite Belinda Carlile song, Heaven is a Place on Earth.

01:50:03.220 --> 01:50:06.220
This is a remix by Wildside.

01:50:06.220 --> 01:50:09.220
Alright, this is Wildside with Heaven is a Place on Earth.

01:50:09.220 --> 01:50:13.220
Jamie's pick for this week's cage match. Enjoy.

01:50:13.220 --> 01:50:16.220
Ooh baby do you know that's where

01:50:16.220 --> 01:50:18.220
Ooh heaven is a place on earth

01:50:18.220 --> 01:50:21.220
This ain't heaven, love comes first

01:50:21.220 --> 01:50:24.220
We'll make heaven out of place on earth

01:50:24.220 --> 01:50:29.220
Ooh, heaven is a place on earth

01:50:54.220 --> 01:51:00.220
Ooh, heaven is a place on earth

01:51:10.220 --> 01:51:13.220
When the night falls down

01:51:13.220 --> 01:51:16.220
I'll be forty and just come around

01:51:16.220 --> 01:51:19.220
And the world of light

01:51:19.220 --> 01:51:22.220
Unlucky, on the seat I slide

01:51:22.220 --> 01:51:28.220
Then walked into the room As you pull me close, I will start to move

01:51:28.220 --> 01:51:33.220
And we're standing with the stars above And lift me up in a wave of love

01:51:33.220 --> 01:51:38.220
Ooh, baby, send love back where Ooh, heaven is a place on earth

01:51:38.220 --> 01:51:44.220
We say heaven, love comes first Don't make heaven out of space on earth

01:51:44.220 --> 01:51:49.220
Ooh, heaven is based on us

01:52:00.220 --> 01:52:03.220
When I feel love alone

01:52:03.220 --> 01:52:06.220
I reach for you and you bring me home

01:52:06.220 --> 01:52:09.220
When I'm lost at sea

01:52:09.220 --> 01:52:12.220
I hear your voice and it scares me

01:52:12.220 --> 01:52:15.220
In this world we're just beginning

01:52:15.220 --> 01:52:18.220
To understand the marriage of babies

01:52:18.220 --> 01:52:20.220
Maybe I was afraid we'd go

01:52:20.220 --> 01:52:24.220
But I'm not afraid anymore

01:52:24.220 --> 01:52:27.220
Ooh, baby, do you know that we're

01:52:27.220 --> 01:52:30.220
Ooh, heaven is a place on earth

01:52:30.220 --> 01:52:33.220
You say heaven loves conflict

01:52:33.220 --> 01:52:36.220
No big heaven had a place on earth

01:52:36.220 --> 01:52:38.220
Ooh, baby, do you know that we're

01:52:38.220 --> 01:52:41.220
Ooh, heaven is a place on earth

01:52:41.220 --> 01:52:47.220
We say heaven, love comes first Don't think heaven out of place on earth

01:52:47.220 --> 01:52:52.220
Ooh, heaven is a place on earth

01:52:52.220 --> 01:53:15.900
Ooh, heaven, you're safe on earth Ooh, baby, do you know that we're, we're,

01:53:15.900 --> 01:53:21.500

01:53:21.500 --> 01:53:23.500
Yeah, yeah, yeah

01:53:51.500 --> 01:54:19.500
Ooh, baby, do you know that's where Ooh, heaven is a place on earth

01:54:19.500 --> 01:54:43.620
Ooh, heaven is a place on earth Ooh, baby, do you know that's where we're

01:54:43.620 --> 01:54:44.620
at?

01:54:44.620 --> 01:54:47.620
Alrighty, that's the last pick.

01:54:47.620 --> 01:54:51.620
Wildside with Heaven is a Place on Earth. Let's go around and get your thoughts on that. Jamie?

01:54:51.620 --> 01:54:52.620
Ten.

01:54:52.620 --> 01:54:55.620
I give it nine and it's very well redone.

01:54:55.620 --> 01:54:58.620
I dislike speed mixes, so I will give it a seven.

01:54:58.620 --> 01:55:03.620
But I have a DWI for it, so I give it a seven point five.

01:55:03.620 --> 01:55:07.620
You know, that was pretty good. I'm beginning to like Wildside a lot.

01:55:07.620 --> 01:55:12.620
If you didn't recognize the name at first, they're the same band that did Irresistible Men from DDR Extreme.

01:55:12.620 --> 01:55:19.620
there

01:55:19.860 --> 01:55:21.880
it was a pretty good mix i'll give it an eight

01:55:21.880 --> 01:55:24.020
eight three eighties

01:55:24.020 --> 01:55:26.340

whole damn thing if you listen to the special on Friday Saturday Wendell's in

01:56:30.820 --> 01:56:34.820
the whole damn thing, so he didn't need a special interview.

01:56:34.820 --> 01:56:40.820
Yeah, that was great, I mean hey, if you were, just goes to show, we stay on top of shit,

01:56:40.820 --> 01:56:45.300
if you stay tuned in to Orange Lounge and you're on the net, you're gonna be the first

01:56:45.300 --> 01:56:49.260
to hear about all these news, especially when big tournaments are going on, because we got

01:56:49.260 --> 01:56:50.260
you covered.

01:56:50.260 --> 01:56:51.900
We got you covered, alright.

01:56:51.900 --> 01:56:54.260
Here we go, let's second half of the interviews.

01:56:54.260 --> 01:56:59.740
Alright, it's 547pm on Sunday and they've just announced all the winners for Freestyle,

01:56:59.740 --> 01:57:05.340
taking home Max 2 Machine, Bruce Leroy, and lots of great routines. Honestly, any of these

01:57:05.340 --> 01:57:09.020
routines would have won a normal tournament. I'm going to go around and see if I can't

01:57:09.020 --> 01:57:15.500
get some reaction from some folks. We'll see what we can get here. I'm standing here with

01:57:15.500 --> 01:57:19.300
JP Money, who came in, I believe, 7th place, right, with this routine. Fabulous, fabulous

01:57:19.300 --> 01:57:22.140
ending to your routine, by the way, with all the money. Where'd that idea come from?

01:57:22.140 --> 01:57:29.140
Actually, that was brought to my attention by the minds of my, the people staying in

01:57:29.140 --> 01:57:31.900
the room with my roommates there you go and that's what I was looking for and I

01:57:31.900 --> 01:57:35.140

01:57:35.140 --> 01:57:39.860

Later. Alright, I'm staying here with the AJ Sweet Banana who's taking home 3rd place.

01:58:07.260 --> 01:58:10.780
Awesome routine. Definitely would have been in my top 3, too. How'd you feel about today?

01:58:10.780 --> 01:58:16.540
Pretty good. Not bad for a week's worth of procrastination, but yeah. A lot of stuff

01:58:16.540 --> 01:58:21.660
here will be on eBay eventually, because I have a lot of it at home. But yeah, it's okay.

01:58:21.660 --> 01:58:26.400
Because it's cool and I have Ikaruga. How did you exactly, you kind of crammed two really

01:58:26.400 --> 01:58:29.220

01:58:29.220 --> 01:58:29.760

but it's not going to take that tomorrow

01:58:53.640 --> 01:58:56.640
Oh crap, that's the one you ought to have been cramming for, huh?

01:58:56.640 --> 01:59:00.640
Yeah, and shout out to anyone who sees my iBook!

01:59:00.640 --> 01:59:04.640
It has been stolen, and yeah, I lost my iBook here.

01:59:04.640 --> 01:59:07.640
It's stolen from behind the pre-reg thing, but it's alright.

01:59:07.640 --> 01:59:10.640
You know, I got something in return. It's all good. Yeah.

01:59:10.640 --> 01:59:12.640
Alright, anything else you want to say to folks out there listening?

01:59:12.640 --> 01:59:15.640
Uh, just if you're playing the game, have fun. That's all there is to it.

01:59:15.640 --> 01:59:17.640
Alright, thanks. Have a good celebration tonight.

01:59:17.640 --> 01:59:19.640
Alright, thanks.

01:59:19.640 --> 01:59:21.640
Does anyone know if AJ found his iBook?

01:59:21.640 --> 01:59:28.640
Let us know. We're curious because that sucks to have stuff stolen. Bad people.

01:59:28.640 --> 01:59:31.640
Naughty.

01:59:31.640 --> 01:59:35.640
All right, now we're talking to the winner. Say hello to Bruce Leroy, everybody.

01:59:35.640 --> 01:59:37.640
Hey, everybody. What's going on?

01:59:37.640 --> 01:59:38.640
How does it feel?

01:59:38.640 --> 01:59:46.640
It feels amazing. I came out here and my first round was really kind of a disappointment for me.

01:59:46.640 --> 01:59:54.320
I kind of choked a little bit and I knew I had to represent at this point and I had faith

01:59:54.320 --> 01:59:55.320
in this routine.

01:59:55.320 --> 02:00:00.360
Lookin' Up a Rock is a very fast song, it required a lot of dedication and it came through

02:00:00.360 --> 02:00:05.600
and it came together and I didn't blank out like I did yesterday which was thank God for

02:00:05.600 --> 02:00:10.040
that and everyone felt the moves, that was the main part.

02:00:10.040 --> 02:00:14.400
The crowd felt me, that was the main thing that put me over the edge I think.

02:00:14.400 --> 02:00:19.360
I filled the song, communicated with the song, and the song communicated through me, so that's

02:00:19.360 --> 02:00:20.360
how I try to do it.

02:00:20.360 --> 02:00:21.360
Definitely, I totally agree.

02:00:21.360 --> 02:00:23.840
Was there anything that you did to prepare for today's routine?

02:00:23.840 --> 02:00:24.840
Definitely.

02:00:24.840 --> 02:00:30.200
I watched Sammy Davis Jr. was a tremendous influence, as was Fred Astaire and Gene Kelly.

02:00:30.200 --> 02:00:33.840
I watched a lot of their footage, like Singin' in the Rain and stuff like that.

02:00:33.840 --> 02:00:38.560
Yeah, and then throwing a bit of my own stuff, I really tried to fill the song, you know?

02:00:38.560 --> 02:00:42.880
A lot of times people do routines and they'll fight the song with their moves, and you gotta

02:00:42.880 --> 02:00:45.280
let the phone tell you what to do

02:00:45.280 --> 02:00:48.280
another questionnaire is my what the hell you know that machine

02:00:48.280 --> 02:00:52.640
uh... i'm gonna try not to get up to norcal put it in my apartment alton

02:01:01.160 --> 02:01:02.960

02:01:36.400 --> 02:01:37.400
Keep going, Bruce.

02:01:37.400 --> 02:01:38.400
Oh, my God.

02:01:38.400 --> 02:01:39.400
Yes.

02:01:39.400 --> 02:01:40.400
All right.

02:01:40.400 --> 02:01:41.400
We'll be back.

02:01:41.400 --> 02:01:42.400
Can you get a picture?

02:01:42.400 --> 02:01:43.400
All right.

02:01:43.400 --> 02:01:45.400
I'm sitting here with the Master 42, who came in second place.

02:01:45.400 --> 02:01:46.400
How do you feel about today's tournament?

02:01:46.400 --> 02:01:47.400
Oh, it was so much fun.

02:01:47.400 --> 02:01:53.200
I'm just so glad that I got to compete here with everybody and got a chance to, for everyone,

02:01:53.200 --> 02:01:58.880
and I got a chance for everyone to see the skills and just for, just to portray the event

02:01:58.880 --> 02:02:02.760
here is just a lot of is everybody's every tournament and their performance

02:02:02.760 --> 02:02:06.600
is really really strong they decided to go a little og with your team how'd you

02:02:06.600 --> 02:02:09.840
go about picking your song well I I remember when I first started learning

02:02:09.840 --> 02:02:14.120
about freestyling I downloaded videos off the internet and I saw this group

02:02:14.120 --> 02:02:18.240
this Korean group called a team and they performed to this song and I thought it

02:02:18.240 --> 02:02:21.960
was just the awesomest thing ever I was like oh my gosh that's incredible how

02:02:21.960 --> 02:02:27.720
did they do that and so you and master 42 dark Sakura could be great friends

02:02:27.720 --> 02:02:29.400
uh... class

02:02:29.400 --> 02:02:32.060
but i think what we want to move from that video

02:02:32.060 --> 02:02:35.800
but uh... and i just i just want a part of the senate dot right on so it's not

02:02:35.800 --> 02:02:37.160
the right now i get it

02:02:37.160 --> 02:02:38.360
we can do the price

02:02:38.360 --> 02:02:41.600
i don't go home and play out here

02:02:41.600 --> 02:02:44.000
i had an american version of the playstation

02:02:44.000 --> 02:02:45.840
back to try to bring american

02:02:45.840 --> 02:02:47.860
place that i think you are

02:02:47.860 --> 02:02:51.480
to play here but i'd like a lot more than they would actually work i needed

02:02:51.480 --> 02:02:55.400
the uh... japanese version of the are now i have that so now the next minute

02:02:55.400 --> 02:02:57.400
I won't be in that same pickle.

02:02:57.400 --> 02:02:58.400
Alright, so what's next for you?

02:02:58.400 --> 02:02:59.400
Are you going to be doing tournaments?

02:02:59.400 --> 02:03:00.400
Are you going to take a break?

02:03:00.400 --> 02:03:01.400
More tournaments in the future?

02:03:01.400 --> 02:03:04.400
Yeah, I heard there's a tournament coming up in July that has a freestyle aspect,

02:03:04.400 --> 02:03:05.400
so I'm going to check that out.

02:03:05.400 --> 02:03:07.400
I don't think it will be as big as CyberZone,

02:03:07.400 --> 02:03:09.400
but it will be something to do, to look forward to.

02:03:09.400 --> 02:03:10.400
Sounds good.

02:03:10.400 --> 02:03:11.400
And how are you celebrating tonight?

02:03:11.400 --> 02:03:12.400
I think some...

02:03:12.400 --> 02:03:16.400
We speculate, by the way, that July tournament that Master 42 references

02:03:16.400 --> 02:03:19.400
could possibly be like this, actually a really big tournament.

02:03:19.400 --> 02:03:22.400
I think March Madness is going to be a qualifier.

02:03:22.400 --> 02:03:24.400
Yeah, this might be a big deal.

02:03:24.400 --> 02:03:27.400
But yeah, more details to come on that one.

02:03:27.400 --> 02:03:29.400
Guys, we're going down to Roscoe's for Chicken and Waffles.

02:03:29.400 --> 02:03:30.400
Roscoe!

02:03:30.400 --> 02:03:32.400
Yeah, that's right, that's right!

02:03:32.400 --> 02:03:35.400
We want, we want Roscoe's!

02:03:35.400 --> 02:03:36.400
Yeah!

02:03:36.400 --> 02:03:37.400
Yeah!

02:03:37.400 --> 02:03:40.400
So I think we're going to head down there for some Chicken and Waffles.

02:03:40.400 --> 02:03:42.400
Alright, anything else you want to say to the fine folks listening?

02:03:42.400 --> 02:03:45.400
Just congratulations to everyone, and take up TDR.

02:03:45.400 --> 02:03:48.400
You might feel funky at first, but it's the best game, like, in the world, man.

02:03:48.400 --> 02:03:50.400
It gets you laid like you can't believe.

02:03:50.400 --> 02:03:51.400
Totally, man.

02:03:51.400 --> 02:03:52.400
It does?

02:03:52.400 --> 02:03:53.400
What the hell am I doing wrong?

02:03:53.400 --> 02:03:58.400
all right thanks for talking to us all right thanks a lot man

02:03:58.400 --> 02:04:03.400
fucked up and he forgot to have the third place match

02:04:03.400 --> 02:04:08.400
whoa that went into fremont interviews because i used the same tape there all right

02:04:08.400 --> 02:04:12.400
that was it that was uh all the interviews that we did that night

02:04:12.400 --> 02:04:17.400
and then right after that we headed over to roscos and in the special you're gonna actually

02:04:17.400 --> 02:04:22.400
hear some stuff taped at roscos including uh you'll hear the waiter was

02:04:22.400 --> 02:04:27.880
there and I believe, I don't remember if I got Wendell's speech or not. We did a shot,

02:04:27.880 --> 02:04:32.840
we did maple syrup shots basically. Us at our table, we did shots because the waiter

02:04:32.840 --> 02:04:36.340
gave us the idea. He was talking about crazy customers that did shots of it. We all did

02:04:36.340 --> 02:04:42.240
a shot and did a toast. It was a beautiful moment. Roscoe's was actually one of the highlights.

02:04:42.240 --> 02:04:50.240
It tasted like... Actually, Roscoe's was seriously one of the highlights of the trip. I mean,

02:04:50.240 --> 02:04:53.000
tournament yeah whatever it's DDR tournament but Roscoe's wasn't like

02:04:53.000 --> 02:04:57.440
everybody was there just having a good old time just party that's really what

02:04:57.440 --> 02:05:01.680
it was all about the hell with the tournament

02:05:01.680 --> 02:05:07.400
Roscoe's is the shit did you see the pictures from Roscoe's you must go to

02:05:07.400 --> 02:05:10.720
Roscoe's when you go down there I got sure when I was there for a X because we

02:05:10.720 --> 02:05:14.760
were so busy although it was kind of funny walking into this little you know

02:05:14.760 --> 02:05:22.020
a mom-and-pop diner wearing my Mad Hatter costume with my big black wings.

02:05:22.020 --> 02:05:23.020
Very cool.

02:05:23.020 --> 02:05:24.020
That was cool.

02:05:24.020 --> 02:05:25.020
And all the white faces.

02:05:25.020 --> 02:05:26.420
We literally took over like half of Roscoe's.

02:05:26.420 --> 02:05:29.300
We had all the people, because this was a Sunday night, we had all the people on the

02:05:29.300 --> 02:05:34.180
one side come back from church, come in and get their grits and their greens, and then

02:05:34.180 --> 02:05:37.020
they had us just crazy kids there.

02:05:37.020 --> 02:05:41.560
Are we going to go to a break?

02:05:41.560 --> 02:05:45.020
We're gonna go to a break, and when we come back, we'll announce the winner of this week's

02:05:45.020 --> 02:05:49.140
cage match, and, uh, yeah.

02:05:49.140 --> 02:05:50.140
Won't that be exciting?

02:05:50.140 --> 02:05:51.140
It'll be.

02:05:51.140 --> 02:05:52.140
I'm stretching for time.

02:05:52.140 --> 02:05:55.520
Loki, say something to stretch time here while I load up something for the break.

02:05:55.520 --> 02:05:56.520
Say something?

02:05:56.520 --> 02:05:57.520
Yeah, something.

02:05:57.520 --> 02:05:58.520
Uh...

02:05:58.520 --> 02:05:59.520
Your mom.

02:05:59.520 --> 02:06:04.320
Alright, we'll play the song that won the tournament.

02:06:04.320 --> 02:06:06.280
Bruce Leroy used this song for his routine.

02:06:06.280 --> 02:06:07.280
It rules.

02:06:07.280 --> 02:06:08.760
Uh, great.

02:06:08.760 --> 02:06:09.760
Great routine.

02:06:09.760 --> 02:06:11.760
Take it and go rock!

02:06:11.760 --> 02:06:12.760
that's the end of the show.

02:06:12.760 --> 02:06:13.760
I'll see you in the next one.

02:06:13.760 --> 02:06:14.760
Thanks for watching and I'll see you next time.

02:07:44.760 --> 02:07:46.760
You're on the run

02:07:46.760 --> 02:07:48.760
You're on the run

02:09:18.760 --> 02:09:25.760
Let's get down to the night, come on, I wanna get down

02:09:25.760 --> 02:09:33.760
Oh yeah, let's get down to the night, come on, gotta get on down

02:09:33.760 --> 02:09:36.760
Cool, like a gangster ham, JT player's ready to swing

02:09:36.760 --> 02:09:38.760
You see the bounce and now the funk move the crowd

02:09:38.760 --> 02:09:40.760
If you win it, let me hear it, if you win it, don't doubt

02:09:40.760 --> 02:09:42.760
We hittin', tell me who be the crew

02:09:42.760 --> 02:09:44.760
Who be the crowd like it's comin' on through JB

02:09:44.760 --> 02:09:47.760
With the JT vibe from the 80's, you know how it goes

02:09:47.760 --> 02:09:48.760
celebration, babe

02:09:48.760 --> 02:09:50.120
How about it, I'll rub up the bag

02:09:50.120 --> 02:09:51.800
I'm about to be the fool and see what

02:09:51.800 --> 02:09:53.220
Yeah, ain't you going to be doing it

02:09:53.220 --> 02:09:54.380
Here like some kinda slicker

02:09:54.380 --> 02:09:56.380
Yo, J.P. got the false touch of his fingers

02:09:56.380 --> 02:10:00.260
J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J

02:10:00.260 --> 02:10:04.080
Yeah, let's get down to the lawn

02:10:04.080 --> 02:10:07.080
I wanna get down

02:10:07.080 --> 02:10:11.380
Oh yeah, let's get down to the lawn

02:10:11.380 --> 02:10:14.700
We gotta get down

02:10:14.700 --> 02:10:44.020
Alright, if you didn't recognize those, those are the top

02:10:44.020 --> 02:10:50.420
Three freestyle songs right there first place was making a rock second place was brilliant to the orchestra groove and third place was let's get

02:10:50.420 --> 02:10:54.120
Down those were the songs that the folks did their routines to and one cyber beat, okay?

02:10:54.120 --> 02:10:58.080
We're gonna take things in a different direction now. We're gonna play a song from dance mania ex2

02:10:58.080 --> 02:11:03.900
This is an interesting trance cover of your song. Let us know what you think of this is interesting when we come back

02:11:03.900 --> 02:11:09.060
We're going to announce the winner of the cage match and this week's listless. It's going to be cool

02:11:33.900 --> 02:12:02.380
It's a little bit funny, the street inside I'm not one of those who can, you're easily

02:12:02.380 --> 02:12:17.380
I don't have much money, but boy, if I die, I'll die a big highway for me

02:12:17.380 --> 02:12:38.380
I know it's not too much, but it's the best that I can do

02:12:38.380 --> 02:12:46.380
I guess this is my moment, this moment for you

02:12:46.380 --> 02:13:02.380
And you can tell everybody this is a song It may be quite simple, but I'll let you know

02:13:02.380 --> 02:13:10.380
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind That I put you down in the wild

02:13:10.380 --> 02:13:17.880
I wonder, if you're laughing, why you're in my mood

02:13:17.880 --> 02:13:39.880
Get on the move, I can't stop them all

02:13:39.880 --> 02:13:46.880
Well, a few other persons, well, they got me quite drunk

02:13:46.880 --> 02:13:53.880
But there's somethin' quite right while I wrote this song

02:13:53.880 --> 02:14:01.880
Just for people like you, babe, just to turn along

02:14:01.880 --> 02:14:08.880
So you may forget, but these things are cool

02:14:08.880 --> 02:14:15.880
You see a provider in their room, all their room

02:14:15.880 --> 02:14:22.880
And we feel what I really need

02:14:22.880 --> 02:14:30.880
You're not the sweetest eye I've ever seen

02:14:30.880 --> 02:14:37.880
And you can tell everybody it's just a song

02:14:37.880 --> 02:14:43.880
Can't wait to be acquired, I should be born, now that's done

02:14:44.880 --> 02:14:47.880
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind

02:14:47.880 --> 02:14:51.880
That I put you down in the world

02:14:52.880 --> 02:14:55.880
I want love so highly

02:14:55.880 --> 02:14:58.880
While you're in my world

02:15:00.880 --> 02:15:04.880
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind

02:15:04.880 --> 02:15:09.880
And I put them down and run

02:15:09.880 --> 02:15:13.880
How wonderful I feel

02:15:13.880 --> 02:15:18.880
Like you're in my world

02:15:18.880 --> 02:15:30.880
Music

02:15:30.880 --> 02:15:36.880
From the Step Squad to Orange Labs, this video sucks!

02:15:36.880 --> 02:15:37.880
Holla!

02:15:37.880 --> 02:15:38.880
Stop! Stop! Stop!

02:15:38.880 --> 02:15:39.880
Stop! Stop!

02:15:39.880 --> 02:15:40.880
You son of a bitch!

02:15:40.880 --> 02:15:41.880
Back to site!

02:15:41.880 --> 02:15:42.880
P.S.!

02:15:42.880 --> 02:15:43.880
GG P.O.

02:15:43.880 --> 02:15:44.880
Laughter

02:15:44.880 --> 02:15:45.880
Whee!

02:15:45.880 --> 02:15:56.600
Alright, that was Obsession from DanceManiaEX2 with your song, and I think Jamie just about

02:15:56.600 --> 02:15:58.600
vomited during that.

02:15:58.600 --> 02:16:01.280
I tried to ignore it, I blocked it out.

02:16:01.280 --> 02:16:03.120
We were looking at my afterburner.

02:16:03.120 --> 02:16:05.920
Personally, I kind of like it, it's not horrible.

02:16:05.920 --> 02:16:07.480
My afterburner outshined that.

02:16:07.480 --> 02:16:08.880
That was very cool.

02:16:08.880 --> 02:16:11.080
Jamie, tell us about the mod you got for your game.

02:16:11.080 --> 02:16:15.240
I have an afterburner installed on my Game Boy Advance that basically just, it's lights

02:16:15.240 --> 02:16:21.560
that go around the screen and lights up. So you don't need a game shield or anything.

02:16:21.560 --> 02:16:24.760
And it's brilliant. I can play in the dark.

02:16:24.760 --> 02:16:28.480
Alright, it's time to announce the winner, ladies and gentlemen, of this week's cage

02:16:28.480 --> 02:16:29.480
match.

02:16:29.480 --> 02:16:32.880
Me! My foot wins.

02:16:32.880 --> 02:16:37.360
Now, you guys, I have to admit, I think a lot of you, we got way less votes than we

02:16:37.360 --> 02:16:38.360
usually do this week.

02:16:38.360 --> 02:16:40.360
I think it's zero wins. I vote for zero.

02:16:40.360 --> 02:16:46.880
I got way less votes than I usually do for cage match, but you know, it just it just happens sometimes and I begged

02:16:46.880 --> 02:16:48.880
I pleaded but we got all the votes

02:16:50.040 --> 02:16:56.640
And so yeah, I know this is actually gonna be a surprise to everyone but folks we added up the votes everybody and the winner

02:16:57.360 --> 02:16:59.360
Is a little bit surprising?

02:17:00.200 --> 02:17:02.200
the winner you guys is

02:17:02.200 --> 02:17:09.200
is wild side with heaven as a place on earth

02:17:23.360 --> 02:17:26.720
that's the winner I begged for votes

02:17:26.720 --> 02:17:31.240
alright so it was a close one though

02:17:31.240 --> 02:17:38.240
And, uh, funny enough, Loki, Loki, I thought it was gonna be the whole month you came in dead last to that vote.

02:17:38.240 --> 02:17:39.240
Sorry.

02:17:39.240 --> 02:17:41.240
There's only seven people that voted.

02:17:41.240 --> 02:17:45.240
Where is everybody? That's what I wanna know.

02:17:45.240 --> 02:17:47.240
Don't know. Don't know what to tell ya.

02:17:47.240 --> 02:17:51.240
Alright, so, uh, but Loki, you know what that means?

02:17:51.240 --> 02:17:53.240
That means you just gotta go make another remix.

02:17:53.240 --> 02:17:54.240
Yep.

02:17:54.240 --> 02:17:56.240
That's what I was gonna do anyways.

02:17:56.240 --> 02:18:00.240
You should do a 511 speedmix.

02:18:00.240 --> 02:18:01.240
No.

02:18:01.240 --> 02:18:09.120
All right, there it is, winner of the cage match, Wild Side, Heaven is the place on Earth.

02:18:09.120 --> 02:18:13.680
Okay, now we're going to do a segment on this show, you know it, you love it, we do it damn

02:18:13.680 --> 02:18:18.520
near every week, but god damn it, it's just so popular, so much fun to do, we're doing

02:18:18.520 --> 02:18:20.520
it again.

02:18:20.520 --> 02:18:27.800
Listless, ladies and gentlemen, tonight's topic, Loki, tell us the topic for tonight.

02:18:27.800 --> 02:18:29.800
It's the best 8-bit Nintendo game.

02:18:57.800 --> 02:19:03.260
you have never played it, emulate it, find somebody who has it, and just sit in front of the TV for an hour and play it, and you'll love it.

02:19:03.260 --> 02:19:06.580
and if you've ever played Samba De Amigo, it has the oppa oppa song.

02:19:06.580 --> 02:19:08.580
I do do do do do do do do do.

02:19:08.580 --> 02:19:10.580
yeah dude.

02:19:10.580 --> 02:19:17.420
well, well, well no, but also, for anyone who's ever seen my quote on my banner on the EDR Freak and the one I used to have on Sacre Mani,

02:19:17.420 --> 02:19:19.820
it's, welcome to the fantasy zone, get ready.

02:19:19.820 --> 02:19:21.820
we all know what game that came from.

02:19:21.820 --> 02:19:23.820
fill me in.

02:19:23.820 --> 02:19:31.820
Um, Space Harrier, because Space Harrier was in the fantasy zone, as in from the old game.

02:19:31.820 --> 02:19:34.820
Oh my gosh, I forgot about that because I haven't played that game in so long.

02:19:34.820 --> 02:19:37.820
Why else do you think the whole game was pastel with a checkered floor?

02:19:37.820 --> 02:19:39.820
Okay.

02:19:39.820 --> 02:19:42.820
Alright, here we go. Who's going to start us off tonight?

02:19:42.820 --> 02:19:43.820
You.

02:19:43.820 --> 02:19:52.820
Me? Alright, I'll start. My pick for best 8-bit Nintendo game ever is a little weird, but you've got to represent, you've got to

02:19:52.820 --> 02:19:55.820
You've got to know your roots. You have to know your roots.

02:19:55.820 --> 02:20:00.820
My number three pick for best Nintendo game ever is Dance Aerobics.

02:20:00.820 --> 02:20:02.820
Freak.

02:20:02.820 --> 02:20:06.820
You know, when you said going back to your roots, I was thinking that you were going to start playing RuPaul.

02:20:06.820 --> 02:20:07.820
No.

02:20:07.820 --> 02:20:10.820
You better work. Covergirls, you dancing.

02:20:10.820 --> 02:20:12.820
No. RuPaul did a song called Back to My Roots.

02:20:12.820 --> 02:20:13.820
Oh, really?

02:20:13.820 --> 02:20:14.820
About getting hairdressed.

02:20:14.820 --> 02:20:17.820
Oh, no. I only know the supermodel song. Sorry.

02:20:17.820 --> 02:20:22.820
Dance Robe is my number 3 pick, simply because DDR is a complete rip-off of Dance Robics.

02:20:26.820 --> 02:20:33.820
Track and Build was just not a game a lot of people played, because they didn't want to spend the money on the stupid pad and all that crap.

02:20:34.820 --> 02:20:36.820
I have one pick.

02:20:38.820 --> 02:20:40.820
My number 3 pick...

02:20:40.820 --> 02:20:44.820
Now keep in mind it only came out in Japan, but because it was on the Famicom, it counts.

02:20:44.820 --> 02:20:48.820
KidDracula

02:20:48.820 --> 02:20:52.820
KidDracula

02:20:52.820 --> 02:20:56.820
KidDracula is Jamie's number 3 pick

02:20:56.820 --> 02:21:00.820
Zero

02:21:00.820 --> 02:21:04.820
Hogan's Alley

02:21:04.820 --> 02:21:08.820
Hogan's Alley

02:21:08.820 --> 02:21:12.820
Hogan's Alley

02:21:12.820 --> 02:21:14.820
That is so cool though.

02:21:14.820 --> 02:21:19.300
Hogan's Alley and already the chat room is going crazy saying all these games have to

02:21:19.300 --> 02:21:23.840
be mentioned and I already know none of them are going to get mentioned because our picks

02:21:23.840 --> 02:21:24.840
are off the wall.

02:21:24.840 --> 02:21:25.840
I know these people.

02:21:25.840 --> 02:21:27.340
We've got to go back to our roots here.

02:21:27.340 --> 02:21:28.340
Uh oh.

02:21:28.340 --> 02:21:32.820
Okay, we're going with the best all time fucking game ever, Contra.

02:21:32.820 --> 02:21:33.820
Contra!

02:21:33.820 --> 02:21:40.140
But no way, the Japanese version was better because the trees moved.

02:21:40.140 --> 02:21:45.140
And it had an intro.

02:21:45.140 --> 02:21:47.380
Alright, dance-robics, Kid Dracula.

02:21:47.380 --> 02:21:50.580
It's like anyone pays attention to that when you're shooting random aliens that keep jumping

02:21:50.580 --> 02:21:51.580
at you.

02:21:51.580 --> 02:21:54.180
And tanks and robots and...

02:21:54.180 --> 02:21:56.100
I noticed these things.

02:21:56.100 --> 02:21:58.500
Alright, number two pick.

02:21:58.500 --> 02:22:03.820
My number two pick for best 8-bit game ever, Mega Man 2.

02:22:03.820 --> 02:22:04.820
I hate you.

02:22:04.820 --> 02:22:05.820
That was my number two pick.

02:22:05.820 --> 02:22:07.820
That means I have to come up with the next one.

02:22:07.820 --> 02:22:08.820
Was it really?

02:22:08.820 --> 02:22:09.820
Uh oh.

02:22:09.820 --> 02:22:15.820
Mega Man 2 is my second favorite, but you can take a suggestion from the chatroom, there's plenty of suggestions if you want to see that.

02:22:19.820 --> 02:22:25.820
Alright, then Mega Man 2, the reason why I say Mega Man 2 and not Mega Man 1, just because I think the series...

02:22:25.820 --> 02:22:27.820
Mega Man 2 was the top of the series.

02:22:27.820 --> 02:22:34.820
Mega Man 2 was when it really started to take off. That's really the one that everybody, you know, all the other Mega Mans were a rip-off of, was Mega Man 2.

02:22:34.820 --> 02:22:35.820
Two words. Two words.

02:22:35.820 --> 02:22:36.820
Big shades?

02:22:36.820 --> 02:22:37.820
Metal blades.

02:22:37.820 --> 02:22:48.260
I would shoot myself if I didn't mention it, since you took my number two favorite, Legend

02:22:48.260 --> 02:22:49.260
of Zelda.

02:22:49.260 --> 02:22:58.900
Because I hated Zelda II.

02:22:58.900 --> 02:23:02.460
You know a lot of the chat room would agree with you with it.

02:23:02.460 --> 02:23:03.900
I like Zelda II, I appreciate Zelda II.

02:23:03.900 --> 02:23:10.000
Zelda II was more like playing an RPG, but The Legend of Zelda was just like, oh my god.

02:23:10.000 --> 02:23:13.380
And I would actually have almost mentioned Metroid, except I said I kept Metroid, so

02:23:13.380 --> 02:23:14.800
Zelda.

02:23:14.800 --> 02:23:17.800
And you know, I like Zelda II a lot.

02:23:17.800 --> 02:23:19.760
What's funny is that Nintendo sequels kind of did that.

02:23:19.760 --> 02:23:24.120
You had Mario Bros. 2, it was completely different than Mario Bros. 1.

02:23:24.120 --> 02:23:25.320
I know, I know it wasn't a Mario.

02:23:25.320 --> 02:23:29.060
Zelda II, okay, frickin', his sword was like a little dagger.

02:23:29.060 --> 02:23:30.060
It was pathetic.

02:23:30.060 --> 02:23:31.060
Pathetic dagger.

02:23:31.060 --> 02:23:36.060
I mean, I think he's like, I'm poking you with the dagger, poking you with the dagger.

02:23:36.060 --> 02:23:41.060
Although I did like that in Super Smash Brothers, they gave him his Zelda 2 moves, which made

02:23:41.060 --> 02:23:43.060
more sense for fighting him.

02:23:43.060 --> 02:23:48.060
Dude, in Zelda 2, his sword looked like a penis.

02:23:48.060 --> 02:23:52.060
The exact second you said that, Bob Lombardi said it was a blue penis, like at the exact

02:23:52.060 --> 02:23:53.060
same moment.

02:23:53.060 --> 02:23:54.060
That was scary.

02:23:54.060 --> 02:23:55.060
You guys are on the same wavelength.

02:23:55.060 --> 02:23:57.060
Because that's obvious, though.

02:23:57.060 --> 02:24:01.060
It was a phallic thing, one of the perverted game counselors.

02:24:01.060 --> 02:24:03.060
Alright Ryan, you're number two.

02:24:03.060 --> 02:24:07.060
My number two, it wasn't really popular, but Arkanoid.

02:24:07.060 --> 02:24:08.060
Arkanoid!

02:24:08.060 --> 02:24:10.060
Arkanoid, alright.

02:24:10.060 --> 02:24:12.060
It was the most, yeah, Breakout also.

02:24:12.060 --> 02:24:18.060
It was the most redundant game in the world, and you got really pissed off when you couldn't pass the third level and had to start all over.

02:24:18.060 --> 02:24:21.060
Dan was playing that on our Atari 2600, Breakout.

02:24:21.060 --> 02:24:24.060
Yeah, but at least the Nintendo one was a little more colorful though.

02:24:24.060 --> 02:24:27.060
I was playing that on Neopets the other day, except it's called Corbat's Lab.

02:24:27.060 --> 02:24:29.060
That's what that is!

02:24:29.060 --> 02:24:31.060
How did you play that game?

02:24:31.060 --> 02:24:33.060
Okay.

02:24:33.060 --> 02:24:35.060
Now...

02:24:35.060 --> 02:24:38.060
I'm a master on Distracto Match now. Anyway, we'll talk Neopets later.

02:24:38.060 --> 02:24:41.060
I want to talk about Waste of Time websites at the end of the show.

02:24:41.060 --> 02:24:43.060
Because we have some new ones coming up this week.

02:24:43.060 --> 02:24:45.060
Time to bring out the big guns.

02:24:45.060 --> 02:24:47.060
Castlevania 2, Simon's Quest.

02:24:47.060 --> 02:24:49.060
Excellent. Excellent.

02:24:49.060 --> 02:24:51.060
The only Castlevania... No, not the only Castlevania matters,

02:24:51.060 --> 02:24:53.060
because we have the whole Dracula X series.

02:24:53.060 --> 02:24:58.060
Simon was the hero of all the Belmonts and the non-Belmonts.

02:24:58.060 --> 02:25:03.060
This pissed me off is the fact that with the Captain N cartoon, they made Simon Belmont into this pretentious asshole.

02:25:03.060 --> 02:25:06.060
Yeah, I know. That was stupid.

02:25:06.060 --> 02:25:11.060
Again, Castlevania, another Nintendo game where the sequel was a complete departure from the original.

02:25:11.060 --> 02:25:19.060
Don't let me forget to get you a ROM of Konami World for the Famicom because there's a Castlevania 2 level in it.

02:25:19.060 --> 02:25:25.060
The Konami World Games are a winner, but they're too obscure for anyone to know anything about.

02:25:25.060 --> 02:25:27.060
Okay, Rob.

02:25:27.060 --> 02:25:34.060
Alright, moving on. Okay, now we got the number one choice. My number one choice for greatest 8-bit Nintendo game ever?

02:25:34.060 --> 02:25:36.060
Blaster Master.

02:25:36.060 --> 02:25:40.060
We all know the grenade trick, don't we?

02:25:40.060 --> 02:25:46.060
Absolutely. The sequels to Blaster Master, they don't exist to me. They are ass.

02:25:46.060 --> 02:25:51.060
Somebody needs to make a really good sequel to Blaster Master that plays just like the original.

02:25:51.060 --> 02:25:54.060
That game was the shit. The end.

02:25:54.060 --> 02:25:58.060
You know who should do it? Treasure.

02:25:58.060 --> 02:26:00.060
And they should do it like the way they did Bunk IO.

02:26:00.060 --> 02:26:02.060
I have no idea what that is.

02:26:02.060 --> 02:26:03.060
You don't know what Treasure is?

02:26:03.060 --> 02:26:04.060
I've never played it.

02:26:04.060 --> 02:26:07.060
Treasure is the best video game manufacturing group ever.

02:26:07.060 --> 02:26:09.060
They did Gunstar Heroes.

02:26:09.060 --> 02:26:14.980
Okay, they did radiant silver gun. Oh, okay. Yeah. Okay. Oh, you should just said the people that do radiant silver gun

02:26:14.980 --> 02:26:16.980
No, no treasure treasure

02:26:17.460 --> 02:26:19.300
Yeah, whoosh. Oh, well, okay

02:26:19.300 --> 02:26:25.020
But technically actually I just have to say is that my number one would really be the same thing that Jamie's putting for her

02:26:25.020 --> 02:26:29.460
Number one, but I already knew she was gonna put it so I didn't have to so I said something else. All right

02:26:30.260 --> 02:26:34.620
Guardian legend fuck. Yeah, the Guardian legends best game ever

02:26:34.620 --> 02:26:41.620
her

02:27:34.620 --> 02:27:38.900
things should kill the higher levels you get, so it has that RPG element in it too.

02:27:38.900 --> 02:27:41.980
And by the way, you find little shops with these blue aliens, and it's Lolo and Lala

02:27:41.980 --> 02:27:45.900
from Adventures of Lolo.

02:27:45.900 --> 02:27:51.420
And then you find these little levels, and the way that the levels are set up, you have

02:27:51.420 --> 02:27:56.660
your entry level, which is level 0, and then you have 110, 220, or like that.

02:27:56.660 --> 02:27:57.660
It was 111, didn't it?

02:27:57.660 --> 02:27:58.660
It wasn't 11, 12?

02:27:58.660 --> 02:27:59.660
No, it was 111.

02:27:59.660 --> 02:28:00.660
It was 111.

02:28:00.660 --> 02:28:03.980
Because when you get to level 10, it's 1020.

02:28:03.980 --> 02:28:07.500
Which were, by the way, the freakin' hardest levels in the universe.

02:28:07.500 --> 02:28:13.380
I have beaten that game all of once.

02:28:13.380 --> 02:28:14.380
Beautiful game.

02:28:14.380 --> 02:28:18.620
I can beat, you know, the last level of the game, I can breeze my way through, cause once

02:28:18.620 --> 02:28:22.320
you get the backfire weapon, you just like sit in the corner and shoot it with the backfire

02:28:22.320 --> 02:28:23.320
weapon.

02:28:23.320 --> 02:28:28.940
And by the way, your game counselor tip of the day, use TGL as your password to bypass

02:28:28.940 --> 02:28:30.940
the Zelda-ish part of the game.

02:28:30.940 --> 02:28:33.620
unbreakable password system

02:28:33.620 --> 02:28:36.780
uh... interesting no one has been able to break this uh... password system

02:28:36.780 --> 02:28:39.960
you know i can't figure out all the mega man was like you know no problem but

02:28:39.960 --> 02:28:41.460
no one can break

02:28:41.460 --> 02:28:43.080
the guardian legends password system

02:28:43.080 --> 02:28:44.620
as you can see g l

02:28:44.620 --> 02:28:48.200
you bypass all the adventure levels and you play like just like shooter

02:28:48.200 --> 02:28:51.020
in between levels you get your special weapons and what you normally would have

02:28:51.020 --> 02:28:54.100
gotten

02:28:54.100 --> 02:28:57.160
enough about how are you out that boy we spent a lot of time on that one it's

02:28:57.160 --> 02:28:59.240
obvious were a little bias here sorry

02:28:59.240 --> 02:29:00.280
zero

02:29:00.280 --> 02:29:02.680
What's your number one pick?

02:29:02.680 --> 02:29:04.580
My number one pick was

02:29:04.580 --> 02:29:06.440
Super Mario Brothers 3

02:29:06.440 --> 02:29:07.340
because it was

02:29:07.340 --> 02:29:11.220
I don't know, it was just like the best one and it almost seemed like it was kind of ahead of its time

02:29:11.220 --> 02:29:15.180
when it came to getting all the different suits and stuff. And plus,

02:29:15.180 --> 02:29:19.680
the first time anyone ever saw it was in the greatest movie ever.

02:29:19.680 --> 02:29:21.200
And the wizard...

02:29:21.200 --> 02:29:24.820
The wizard is the coolest movie in history. If you haven't seen it,

02:29:24.820 --> 02:29:27.000
go buy it.

02:29:27.000 --> 02:29:29.000
The power glove. It's so bad.

02:29:29.000 --> 02:29:31.000
Go rent it.

02:29:31.000 --> 02:29:33.000
Get your power glove off her.

02:29:33.000 --> 02:29:35.000
Yeah, what was the point?

02:29:35.000 --> 02:29:37.000
I don't even think it was that useful.

02:29:37.000 --> 02:29:39.000
I think you used it for two things and that was it.

02:29:39.000 --> 02:29:41.000
I want the left hand and the right hand one.

02:29:41.000 --> 02:29:43.000
I want the left hand and the right hand one.

02:29:43.000 --> 02:29:47.000
So I could try to figure out how to punch out to it.

02:29:47.000 --> 02:29:49.000
That would be so cool.

02:29:49.000 --> 02:29:51.000
Remember the U-Force?

02:29:51.000 --> 02:29:53.000
Yeah.

02:29:53.000 --> 02:30:16.000
The power glove is so unbelievably rare that if you find one you can easily sell it on eBay for $100.

02:30:23.000 --> 02:30:29.900
just the right for like 500 bucks you can't find him anywhere you should you

02:30:29.900 --> 02:30:39.200
should check okay anyway all right yeah there's like tons of choices tons of

02:30:39.200 --> 02:30:47.120
choices get your paraglobe offer well you know it's a kind of enough he

02:30:47.120 --> 02:30:52.940
You touched my breast!

02:30:52.940 --> 02:30:55.220
That was great.

02:30:55.220 --> 02:30:57.920
Do touch your breast now.

02:30:57.920 --> 02:31:02.560
One of my favorite games on the Nintendo had to have been,

02:31:02.560 --> 02:31:04.760
I don't know, I go back and play it now and it's just like,

02:31:04.760 --> 02:31:07.000
okay, whatever.

02:31:07.000 --> 02:31:10.560
Bionic Commando.

02:31:10.560 --> 02:31:13.200
Do you ever read Old Schooled?

02:31:13.200 --> 02:31:17.080
The guy from Bionic Commando hangs out in the bar with all the other Nintendo characters,

02:31:17.080 --> 02:31:20.280
He's like their hero because his bionic arm can reach out and grab beer from across the

02:31:20.280 --> 02:31:27.280
hall.

02:31:27.280 --> 02:31:31.080
That game was cool because you didn't have an arm, you had this giant claw thing that

02:31:31.080 --> 02:31:36.300
grabbed on stuff and you couldn't jump because I guess the arm weighed too much and like

02:31:36.300 --> 02:31:40.800
there's these guys that looked all the same but they were different shades of color and

02:31:40.800 --> 02:31:45.360
they were put there different people and stuff happened and if you got caught by the people

02:31:45.360 --> 02:32:04.360
The fact also you could choose your path too, and like you could say I want to go this way to like B or K and then bounce all around is pretty fun.

02:32:04.360 --> 02:32:07.360
You said BK, and I started thinking of British Knights.

02:32:07.360 --> 02:32:09.360
I started thinking of Burger King.

02:32:09.360 --> 02:32:11.360
Hold on.

02:32:11.360 --> 02:32:13.360
I gotta, I'm sorry, you know,

02:32:13.360 --> 02:32:15.360
I like Bionic Commando,

02:32:15.360 --> 02:32:17.360
but there's just something that just got a flash in my mind.

02:32:17.360 --> 02:32:20.360
One of the best games ever,

02:32:20.360 --> 02:32:22.360
and I need to change mine. I'm sorry.

02:32:22.360 --> 02:32:24.360
You wanna change that one, or you wanna change one of your other ones?

02:32:24.360 --> 02:32:26.360
You wanna change Contra, Castlevania 2?

02:32:26.360 --> 02:32:28.360
Change Contra.

02:32:28.360 --> 02:32:30.360
Oh, okay.

02:32:32.360 --> 02:32:34.360
Alright, what are we putting on instead of Contra then?

02:32:34.360 --> 02:32:40.360
You know, this might be a bad decision, but Marble Madness. Marble Madness!

02:32:40.360 --> 02:32:47.360
They made the best points when they died. And the absence. And the Marvel video.

02:32:47.360 --> 02:32:52.360
Best game ever, and I wish they'd make it on a new system, but they haven't yet.

02:32:52.360 --> 02:32:54.360
It's on the Atari collection.

02:32:54.360 --> 02:32:59.360
It's on the Atari collection for the, um, or no, the Midway collection for PlayStation,

02:32:59.360 --> 02:33:02.360
and you can actually get the PlayStation track while we got one.

02:33:02.360 --> 02:33:06.740
believe he just took off contour to put in marble madness all right let's read

02:33:06.740 --> 02:33:12.620
the list here we go the list so far dance aerobics kid Dracula Hogan's Alley

02:33:12.620 --> 02:33:15.220
marble madness Mega Man 2 the Legend of Zelda

02:33:15.220 --> 02:33:19.520
Arknoid Castlevania 2 Simon's Quest blaster master the Guardian legends

02:33:19.520 --> 02:33:23.540
Super Mario Brothers 3 and bionic commando now let's go through those

02:33:23.540 --> 02:33:27.340
glaring omissions according to our chat room that we left off of the list

02:33:27.340 --> 02:33:28.740
i think i think that's right

02:33:28.740 --> 02:33:33.660
metroid had the most obvious this year didn't put the adobe said no here

02:33:33.660 --> 02:33:35.780
uh... final fantasy

02:33:35.780 --> 02:33:37.980
adventure island

02:33:37.980 --> 02:33:42.020
robo-cop

02:33:42.020 --> 02:33:43.920
gyro mike come on

02:33:43.920 --> 02:33:47.100
but you guys i am you can't even squashed a professor to the point

02:33:47.100 --> 02:33:47.900
uh...

02:33:47.900 --> 02:33:50.340
dragon warrior

02:33:50.340 --> 02:33:52.280
check where it is because i had a slime

02:33:52.280 --> 02:33:54.060
bubble bobble

02:33:54.060 --> 02:33:59.060
Bubble Bobble is a kick-ass game, however, the NES translation just was not the same as the arcade.

02:33:59.060 --> 02:34:04.060
If we were talking about, like, best 80s arcade game, maybe, I'd put Bubble Bobble on there, but not for best Nintendo game.

02:34:04.060 --> 02:34:05.060
Right. Kickle Cubicle.

02:34:05.060 --> 02:34:07.060
Kickle Cubicle was pretty cool.

02:34:07.060 --> 02:34:09.060
And, and, and, Anisysm.

02:34:09.060 --> 02:34:15.060
Uh, Kid Icarus, Ice Climber, Battletoads, River City Ransom, Double Dragon.

02:34:15.060 --> 02:34:20.060
Okay, I didn't say River City Ransom because I have the PC Engine version, which totally kicks its ass.

02:34:21.060 --> 02:34:22.060
No, it's Nintendo.

02:34:22.060 --> 02:34:31.180
Nintendo, Star Tropics, yes, um, Mario Tennis, I don't think, no Tennis on 8-bit, don't mention

02:34:31.180 --> 02:34:34.940
any stupid Virtual Boy games because they all gave me a headache, I'm just kind of scrambling

02:34:34.940 --> 02:34:41.340
to list, oh and then last, oh we have Adventures of Lolo, I have, hey I mentioned it, I have

02:34:41.340 --> 02:34:49.580
bad memory, no I'm just kidding, Clu Clu Land, I have psychological damage every time, no

02:34:49.580 --> 02:34:53.580
I can play Clu Clu Land on Animal Crossing, and I can play Balloon Fight on Animal Crossing.

02:35:19.580 --> 02:35:25.960
upload my DWI to the Mike Tyson's punch out like remix I was like perfect DWI to

02:35:25.960 --> 02:35:33.020
it it took me like 30 minutes but it was really good and it has the um and it has

02:35:33.020 --> 02:35:40.680
the instruction manual as the background that's great all right okay so now we

02:35:40.680 --> 02:35:44.760
got to vote stuff off this is gonna be very difficult tonight you guys would be

02:35:44.760 --> 02:35:47.960
very difficult. Uh, I guess I have to start, huh?

02:35:47.960 --> 02:35:53.400
Uh, well, you're all gonna hate me, I'm taking off Marble Madness.

02:35:53.400 --> 02:35:56.880
The reason why, no, I have good justification,

02:35:56.880 --> 02:36:01.280
because Marble Madness was way too short. It was only six levels. The thrill,

02:36:01.280 --> 02:36:04.920
the thrill was gone in a day. I'm sorry, I just can't,

02:36:04.920 --> 02:36:09.000
nah, I can't let it be there. Marble Madness is really only worthy to play if you have the trackball.

02:36:09.000 --> 02:36:13.800
Which is why I was very lucky to hit Toys R Us when they were clearing out their trackballs

02:36:13.800 --> 02:36:34.400
This sucks, because the two obvious ones are gone now.

02:36:34.400 --> 02:36:37.840
I will take off my own, Hogan's Alley.

02:36:37.840 --> 02:36:42.560
It was fun, but it's not one of the very best games ever.

02:36:42.560 --> 02:36:46.800
Amazingly enough, first time in the history of this show, if I'm not mistaken, somebody

02:36:46.800 --> 02:36:48.120
took their own item off the list.

02:36:48.120 --> 02:36:49.120
No?

02:36:49.120 --> 02:36:50.120
No?

02:36:50.120 --> 02:36:51.120
We did this list last week.

02:36:51.120 --> 02:36:52.640
Oh, did you all do that or something?

02:36:52.640 --> 02:36:56.120
I forgot what we did it about, but everybody but me took off.

02:36:56.120 --> 02:36:57.120
Best liquor.

02:36:57.120 --> 02:36:59.000
Oh God, you guys!

02:36:59.000 --> 02:37:01.860
Everybody but me took off one of their own.

02:37:01.860 --> 02:37:02.860
I stand corrected.

02:37:02.860 --> 02:37:06.880
One thing I can't believe we all forgot was Excitebike.

02:37:06.880 --> 02:37:10.600
Even though it was short, it was still a classic though.

02:37:10.600 --> 02:37:14.240
was awesome, but it badly needed an update. Like, if they did it on... Well, I guess some

02:37:14.240 --> 02:37:18.160
say that Uniracers is supposed to be a sequel to Excitebike. I don't buy that.

02:37:18.160 --> 02:37:22.520
And the 64 version was absolutely horrible. I never played that. Oh, God.

02:37:22.520 --> 02:37:27.800
It was stupid. Oh, well. Actually, no, there was one on Gameboy,

02:37:27.800 --> 02:37:32.040
I think it was Motocross Maniac or something, that played kind of similar, but it was ass.

02:37:32.040 --> 02:37:35.200
All right, Loki, last one coming off, what is it?

02:37:35.200 --> 02:37:42.200
Um, just Arkanoid, because I don't like that game.

02:37:42.200 --> 02:37:45.200
Alright, Arkanoid comes off the list.

02:37:45.200 --> 02:37:50.200
Hey, it's either there or Kid Dracula, because Kid Dracula just reminds me of that stupid

02:37:50.200 --> 02:37:51.200
Little Vampire movie.

02:37:51.200 --> 02:37:55.200
And God, I hate that Little Vampire movie.

02:37:55.200 --> 02:38:00.200
I'm going to make him play now.

02:38:00.200 --> 02:38:02.200
Jamie's going to make him play now.

02:38:02.200 --> 02:38:05.200
Alright, here we go.

02:38:05.200 --> 02:38:07.200
Uh, this is the list.

02:38:07.200 --> 02:38:09.200
Send in your votes right now.

02:38:09.200 --> 02:38:16.200
Kid Dracula, Mega Man 2, The Legend of Zelda, Castlevania 2, Simon's Quest, Blaster Master.

02:38:16.200 --> 02:38:17.200
Should I read those?

02:38:17.200 --> 02:38:18.200
Oh, okay. Sorry.

02:38:18.200 --> 02:38:19.200
Should I read those?

02:38:19.200 --> 02:38:21.200
You were too busy getting mad at Loki.

02:38:21.200 --> 02:38:22.200
Alright, then start from the top.

02:38:22.200 --> 02:38:24.920
I'm going to post this in the chatroom.

02:38:24.920 --> 02:38:25.920
All right, star for the top.

02:38:25.920 --> 02:38:27.320
Best 8-bit game ever.

02:38:27.320 --> 02:38:31.480
Kid Dracula, Mega Man 2, The Legend of Zelda, Castlevania II,

02:38:31.480 --> 02:38:35.400
Simon's Quest, Blaster Master, The Guardian Legend, Super Mario

02:38:35.400 --> 02:38:38.520
Brothers 3, and Bionic Commando.

02:38:38.520 --> 02:38:44.480
All right, send in your votes right freaking now.

02:38:44.480 --> 02:38:46.040
In the meantime, we're going to take a quick break.

02:38:46.040 --> 02:38:46.680
We'll be back.

02:38:46.680 --> 02:38:51.360
We got some brief announcements and reminders, a message,

02:38:51.360 --> 02:38:55.800

02:38:55.800 --> 02:39:00.360

02:39:06.360 --> 02:39:07.100

okay we'll be right back after we hear this eight style song that makes me wet

02:43:07.100 --> 02:43:13.220
One, two, three, four!

02:44:07.100 --> 02:44:36.620
Let's listen in on an Orange Lounge Radio staff meeting.

02:44:36.620 --> 02:44:41.620
Stream Bamani Radio. That's us. Orange Lounge Radio.

02:44:41.620 --> 02:44:46.620
We're back. Wrapping up episode number 34 here in this final segment.

02:44:46.620 --> 02:44:53.620
I heard a funny joke. Irene and Brad told me a funny joke today, so I thought we'd have joke time on Orange Lounge Radio.

02:44:53.620 --> 02:44:58.620
So here we go. Knock, knock. Interrupting cow. Moo!

02:44:58.620 --> 02:45:03.620
That's like totally from South Park.

02:45:03.620 --> 02:45:04.620
Is it really?

02:45:04.620 --> 02:45:05.620
Yeah, it's from...

02:45:05.620 --> 02:45:07.620
The other retarded kid, I forget his name.

02:45:07.620 --> 02:45:09.620
I feel like the muffin joke.

02:45:09.620 --> 02:45:10.620
Damn it!

02:45:10.620 --> 02:45:13.620
I didn't know that was from South Park because I stopped watching South Park because I didn't

02:45:13.620 --> 02:45:14.620
even know they were making new ones anymore.

02:45:14.620 --> 02:45:15.620
I feel like the muffin joke.

02:45:15.620 --> 02:45:16.620
Damn.

02:45:16.620 --> 02:45:17.620
I feel like I...

02:45:17.620 --> 02:45:18.620
Oh, you want me to tell the muffin joke?

02:45:18.620 --> 02:45:19.620
I want to tell it.

02:45:19.620 --> 02:45:20.620
Alright.

02:45:20.620 --> 02:45:21.620
You remember the muffin joke?

02:45:21.620 --> 02:45:22.620
Have you heard the muffin joke?

02:45:22.620 --> 02:45:23.620
Okay.

02:45:23.620 --> 02:45:24.620
Okay.

02:45:24.620 --> 02:45:25.620
I'll give Ryan the other mic.

02:45:25.620 --> 02:45:26.620
Alright.

02:45:26.620 --> 02:45:27.620
Two muffins are baking in the oven.

02:45:27.620 --> 02:45:33.420
Baking in the oven and one of the other muffins go. Oh my god. We're cooking we're burning. You know because I should have talking muffin

02:45:38.300 --> 02:45:40.300
Yeah

02:45:41.620 --> 02:45:43.420
All right, I

02:45:43.420 --> 02:45:46.480
Feel stupid now that I know that joke came in South Park

02:45:46.480 --> 02:45:51.960
She's not a stupid joke, but it was kind of just funny the way they said does anybody seen catch me if you can

02:45:52.260 --> 02:45:56.140
No, there's a part where Tom Hanks is sitting there with a bunch of other FBI agents

02:45:56.140 --> 02:45:57.140
Why don't you tell a joke?

02:45:57.140 --> 02:45:58.140
And he's all, okay.

02:45:58.140 --> 02:45:59.140
He's all, knock knock.

02:45:59.140 --> 02:46:00.140
Oh.

02:46:00.140 --> 02:46:01.140
Who's there?

02:46:01.140 --> 02:46:02.140
And he goes, go fuck yourself.

02:46:02.140 --> 02:46:05.140
And that was the end of the joke.

02:46:05.140 --> 02:46:06.140
Right.

02:46:06.140 --> 02:46:07.140
You know what was a joke?

02:46:07.140 --> 02:46:10.860
Those pictures of the person playing DDR just to Sakura.

02:46:10.860 --> 02:46:12.460
That was, that was cute.

02:46:12.460 --> 02:46:13.460
That was cute.

02:46:13.460 --> 02:46:14.460
It was a cute routine.

02:46:14.460 --> 02:46:15.460
Yeah.

02:46:15.460 --> 02:46:16.460
That was a good costume.

02:46:16.460 --> 02:46:17.460
Yeah, it was cool.

02:46:17.460 --> 02:46:18.460
It wasn't a joke.

02:46:18.460 --> 02:46:19.460
It was serious time, man.

02:46:19.460 --> 02:46:20.460
Let's get our winners.

02:46:20.460 --> 02:46:21.460
Oh!

02:46:21.460 --> 02:46:24.780
Also, I have to say, the, uh, one thing I didn't, I forgot to say about Cyberbeat is

02:46:24.780 --> 02:46:27.860
is that my badge said Judge on it, except I wasn't judging freestyle. It's actually

02:46:27.860 --> 02:46:31.620
the Fashion Judge. And you're gonna hear, you'll hear the results of that on the Cyberbeat

02:46:31.620 --> 02:46:32.620
Special.

02:46:32.620 --> 02:46:33.620
Okay.

02:46:33.620 --> 02:46:36.500
So, that airs once again, in case you're just joining us, the Cyberbeat Special will air

02:46:36.500 --> 02:46:40.720
Friday at 7pm Pacific Time and Saturday at 4.

02:46:40.720 --> 02:46:45.220
Okay. Oh yes, the winner's decayed match.

02:46:45.220 --> 02:46:46.940
We've got, we've got Loki playing Kid Dracula now.

02:46:46.940 --> 02:46:48.660
Oh, Loki's hooked on Kid Dracula now? Okay.

02:46:48.660 --> 02:46:49.660
I'm not hooked on it.

02:46:49.660 --> 02:46:50.660
I'm not hooked on it.

02:46:50.660 --> 02:46:51.660
Alright, here we go.

02:46:51.660 --> 02:46:52.660
Tryin' it out.

02:46:52.660 --> 02:47:02.100
Number 3, by your vote, listless, here it is, number 3 best 8-bit game ever, drum roll,

02:47:02.100 --> 02:47:18.120
is Super Mario Bros. 3, or as the guy in the wizard said, Super Mario Bros. 3. Okay. Number

02:47:18.120 --> 02:47:24.040
Number two best Nintendo game ever.

02:47:24.040 --> 02:47:29.520
The Legend of Zelda.

02:47:29.520 --> 02:47:35.120
And the best Nintendo game ever as voted by you guys.

02:47:35.120 --> 02:47:36.120
Mega Man 2.

02:47:36.120 --> 02:47:37.380
It's the winner.

02:47:37.380 --> 02:47:46.600
Mega Man 2 is the best Nintendo game ever according to the chat room.

02:47:46.600 --> 02:47:50.240
Guardian Legend didn't get a single vote. How the hell did that happen?

02:47:50.240 --> 02:47:56.180
It's mostly because people play all the mainstream games. Like Blaster Masters, mainstream as it was, it wasn't.

02:47:56.180 --> 02:47:59.020
I was surprised because I didn't think anybody in here was going to end up

02:47:59.020 --> 02:48:03.180
putting a mainstream. When I was listening to the number three choices, I'm like, nobody's going to put a mainstream game on here

02:48:03.180 --> 02:48:06.220
and then all of a sudden the number ones were all mainstream. But hey, it happens.

02:48:06.220 --> 02:48:08.320
I was going to put a bunch of other ones.

02:48:08.320 --> 02:48:13.020
But no one really played Arkanoid or Hogan's Alley. I played Arkanoid, it just was an arcade game.

02:48:13.020 --> 02:48:16.700
and i played all the images need to go play guardian legend

02:48:16.700 --> 02:48:18.700
all about that too

02:48:18.700 --> 02:48:20.340
the question

02:48:20.340 --> 02:48:23.700
what was the one which have like a fat lady is the boss

02:48:23.700 --> 02:48:30.700
without rampaged her not really ready to get in and i think that's about it

02:48:32.460 --> 02:48:35.340
a car you were used to always pushed out when we played it

02:48:35.340 --> 02:48:37.540
recently to get dust on the

02:48:37.540 --> 02:48:39.940
the game just to see how badly it's rich out

02:48:39.940 --> 02:48:41.180
it was awesome

02:48:41.180 --> 02:48:48.180
No, it was all about pro wrestling. The one where you had like one kick in one punch.

02:48:50.100 --> 02:48:53.980
We had another joke in the chat room. This is pretty funny. John Fields submitted this

02:48:53.980 --> 02:48:58.060
joke. Okay, two guys are hunting in the woods. One gets hurt and the other goes 911. The

02:48:58.060 --> 02:49:02.900
operator says, okay, well let's make sure he's hurt. There's silence then a gunshot.

02:49:02.900 --> 02:49:04.300
Guy comes back on and says, okay, what now?

02:49:04.300 --> 02:49:08.300
Have you ever heard the story of the Fupu Bird?

02:49:08.300 --> 02:49:12.300
Have you heard the story of the Fupu Bird?

02:49:12.300 --> 02:49:16.300
No.

02:49:16.300 --> 02:49:20.300
Three great explorers have hunted this legendary bird called the Fupu Bird.

02:49:20.300 --> 02:49:24.300
The legend is that this bird is making people disappear, but no one knows how.

02:49:24.300 --> 02:49:28.300
Have you ever heard the story of the Fupu Bird?

02:49:28.300 --> 02:49:32.300
No.

02:49:32.300 --> 02:49:37.220
people disappear but no one knows how. So they go into the deep deep deep deep jungle

02:49:37.220 --> 02:49:40.500
and two of them are together and one of them is by himself because this one by himself

02:49:40.500 --> 02:49:44.300
thinks that he's just shit. Well anyway, he's walking along and he hears

02:49:44.300 --> 02:49:50.860
AHH! There's a big wad of bird shit on his head. He does a little crap. He wipes it off

02:49:50.860 --> 02:49:57.420
and he disappears. Ooh, scary. So the other two are together and sure enough they hear

02:49:57.420 --> 02:50:02.420
And one of them gets shit on his head.

02:50:02.420 --> 02:50:05.420
So he wipes it off and he disappears and his friend goes,

02:50:05.420 --> 02:50:06.420
Oh my God! That's how it happens!

02:50:06.420 --> 02:50:08.420
So he runs, runs, runs, runs, runs, runs, runs, runs, runs, runs.

02:50:08.420 --> 02:50:10.420
But right before he sees him, of course,

02:50:10.420 --> 02:50:15.420
And he gets crap on his head.

02:50:15.420 --> 02:50:18.420
So he's smart, though. He's not wiping it off.

02:50:18.420 --> 02:50:20.420
So he goes home with a big pile of poo on his head.

02:50:20.420 --> 02:50:23.420
You know, he gets the best place to sit on the bus and everything.

02:50:23.420 --> 02:50:25.420
He's, you know, in bed with his wife,

02:50:25.420 --> 02:50:28.260
And the wife goes, you need to wipe that crap off your head.

02:50:28.260 --> 02:50:29.860
He's like, no, but if I do, I'll disappear

02:50:29.860 --> 02:50:30.980
and you'll never see me again.

02:50:30.980 --> 02:50:32.900
Oh, well, I love you and we'll leave the crap on your head.

02:50:32.900 --> 02:50:33.940
I can live with that.

02:50:33.940 --> 02:50:36.980
But the stench gets so bad that later on in the night,

02:50:36.980 --> 02:50:37.900
she's like, I can't stand this.

02:50:37.900 --> 02:50:40.460
She wipes off his head and he disappears.

02:50:40.460 --> 02:50:41.940
So you know what the moral of the story is?

02:50:41.940 --> 02:50:42.580
What?

02:50:42.580 --> 02:50:46.220
It's efficient, swear it.

02:50:46.220 --> 02:50:50.540
Oh my god, that was the most awful thing ever.

02:50:50.540 --> 02:50:54.300
My uncle told me this joke when I was 12.

02:50:54.300 --> 02:50:56.300
Thank you for wasting everybody's time.

02:50:56.300 --> 02:50:57.300
Okay.

02:50:57.300 --> 02:50:59.780
Oh, that was the best joke and you know it.

02:50:59.780 --> 02:51:02.460
No, the muffin joke's the best joke.

02:51:02.460 --> 02:51:07.180
A new chatter in the chat room, Bizarro17, starts off a joke, says, so I said to the

02:51:07.180 --> 02:51:08.180
prickly cactus...

02:51:08.180 --> 02:51:10.060
And that was it.

02:51:10.060 --> 02:51:11.060
There's no prickly...

02:51:11.060 --> 02:51:12.060
Okay.

02:51:12.060 --> 02:51:13.060
All right.

02:51:13.060 --> 02:51:16.660
We only got a few minutes left in the show.

02:51:16.660 --> 02:51:20.020
One thing I definitely want to say, a little special message out there.

02:51:20.020 --> 02:51:22.020
One of our biggest supporters in this world...

02:51:22.020 --> 02:51:23.020
Wash behind your ears.

02:51:23.020 --> 02:51:24.020
Yeah, wash behind your ears.

02:51:24.020 --> 02:51:31.300

Yeah, okay, that'll be fun.

02:51:58.180 --> 02:52:01.180
I mean, email is one thing, but I want to send letters.

02:52:01.180 --> 02:52:02.180
Okay, cool.

02:52:02.180 --> 02:52:04.180
Yeah, send us stuff.

02:52:04.180 --> 02:52:05.180

02:52:05.180 --> 02:52:09.180
So, Angel's going off to Japan, so have a great time.

02:52:09.180 --> 02:52:10.180
We'll miss you.

02:52:10.180 --> 02:52:16.180
Get listeners for our show while you're in Japan, and have a fabulous time.

02:52:16.180 --> 02:52:17.180
We'll miss you.

02:52:17.180 --> 02:52:18.180
Aren't you supposed to be announcing something?

02:52:18.180 --> 02:52:19.180
What?

02:52:19.180 --> 02:52:20.180
I don't know.

02:52:20.180 --> 02:52:22.180
No, that was pretty much the announcement.

02:52:22.180 --> 02:52:26.180
I didn't tell them to get all those, you know, freaky Americans, you know, the list of all those weirdos.

02:52:26.180 --> 02:52:26.680
Yep.

02:52:26.680 --> 02:52:29.680
I don't know, Zach Balmonte seems to be announcing something on the show.

02:52:29.680 --> 02:52:32.680
Oh yeah, the Zach Balmonte thing. You were supposed to announce that on the show, too.

02:52:32.680 --> 02:52:34.680
Well, let me just wrap up the angel thing.

02:52:34.680 --> 02:52:36.180
What, the winner?

02:52:36.180 --> 02:52:38.180
Yeah.

02:52:38.180 --> 02:52:39.680
Oops.

02:52:39.680 --> 02:52:42.680
What, you didn't tabulate the votes in time or something?

02:52:42.680 --> 02:52:44.180
Actually, I did.

02:52:44.180 --> 02:52:46.680
The winner.

02:52:46.680 --> 02:52:48.680
Everyone likes JB's.

02:52:48.680 --> 02:52:51.680
Should JB get it the hell finished so we can put it up?

02:53:18.680 --> 02:53:24.380
No, because I guess I missed the joke.

02:53:24.380 --> 02:53:31.300
Oh because it was all in the chat room, no wonder I missed it.

02:53:31.300 --> 02:53:35.040
Okay, here, this is the real joke.

02:53:35.040 --> 02:53:36.740
The set of the Brickling Cactus.

02:53:36.740 --> 02:53:39.380
Okay, God, Jesus, and Saint Peter are golfing.

02:53:39.380 --> 02:53:42.720
Saint Peter steps up to the tee, he takes a big swing, he hits the ball, it goes up

02:53:42.720 --> 02:53:45.560
in the air, it lands ten feet from the cup.

02:53:45.560 --> 02:53:49.540
Jesus steps up, he takes a huge swing, the ball goes flying, it lands two feet from the

02:53:49.540 --> 02:53:50.540
cup.

02:53:50.540 --> 02:53:54.820
God steps up, he takes the biggest swing you could ever see, the ball piddles off the tee.

02:53:54.820 --> 02:53:59.060
All of a sudden, a weasel comes out and picks the ball up, runs off, an eagle comes by,

02:53:59.060 --> 02:54:03.540
picks the weasel up and flies away, a hurricane comes by, blows the eagle back, and the eagle

02:54:03.540 --> 02:54:07.120
drops the weasel.

02:54:07.120 --> 02:54:08.620
And hold on, cause this little bit's here.

02:54:08.620 --> 02:54:12.300
Oh yeah, the weasel drops the ball, the ball rolls into the cup, Jesus looks at God and

02:54:12.300 --> 02:54:17.300
says, are you going to play golf or are you just going to fuck around?

02:54:17.300 --> 02:54:28.300
You're going to hell for that. That's pretty funny. Yeah, well, we're all going to hell.

02:54:28.300 --> 02:54:33.300
If you listen to this show, you're probably going to hell. The guy who made that t-shirt

02:54:33.300 --> 02:54:40.940
from hell.com is going to hell. How about a sim update for the week, Loki? Anything

02:54:40.940 --> 02:54:47.940
you want to say about the sim world, give me a cracker.

02:55:10.940 --> 02:55:14.640
and uh...

02:55:14.640 --> 02:55:15.700
uh...

02:55:15.700 --> 02:55:19.420
the monies and i have stopped the money style just got

02:55:19.420 --> 02:55:23.020
they're uploading their uh... media section against its wish to a dedicated

02:55:23.020 --> 02:55:24.060
server

02:55:24.060 --> 02:55:26.400
thanks to everyone's donations uh...

02:55:26.400 --> 02:55:29.140
so they're going to be a pretty soon with uh...

02:55:29.140 --> 02:55:33.300
all the like media and stuff in all of the itself videos and whatnot

02:55:33.300 --> 02:55:37.100
uh... so they're gonna be coming up here you can see what some weird thing with

02:55:37.100 --> 02:55:40.940
no you have to be like some registered member and what not to download shit

02:55:40.940 --> 02:55:44.620
You can't even download it anyway. Not that that matters anyways when my site comes up

02:55:44.620 --> 02:55:45.980
because I'm just going to have everything and say

02:55:45.980 --> 02:55:49.340
whatever I don't require anything just download the hell

02:55:49.340 --> 02:55:53.100
yeah but yeah my site yeah it's funny

02:55:53.100 --> 02:55:56.300
yeah I'm working on it

02:55:56.300 --> 02:56:00.780
really am it there's a lot of shit I gotta update in order to get this site up

02:56:00.780 --> 02:56:03.900
mainly I'm working on the sim files getting them all zipped up putting

02:56:03.900 --> 02:56:08.600
the appropriate CD tags with them, but a lot of the sim files that are incomplete need

02:56:08.600 --> 02:56:14.380
to be fixed, need to make new backgrounds for them, just fix them up, and so that's

02:56:14.380 --> 02:56:19.580
what's taking the longest time right now. Right now I've got everything done, I've second

02:56:19.580 --> 02:56:23.500
style, third style, and I'm almost done with fourth style. Problem is it's going to get

02:56:23.500 --> 02:56:29.340
even slower now because the higher up I go the more sim files I have. So once those are

02:56:29.340 --> 02:56:34.740
ever done, I promise I'll be a probably be like a good 600 files up it's the first, the

02:56:34.740 --> 02:56:38.660
first update. So, it'll be worth it, but it's just gonna take awhile before that comes up.

02:56:38.660 --> 02:56:44.600
And just so you guys know listening, there will be every week there will be a nice hidden

02:56:44.600 --> 02:56:49.740
page for exclusive to the listeners with Sim Files stuff that will not be on the site and

02:56:49.740 --> 02:56:54.880
I'll maybe be able to give it a month before I update those on to the actual site, off

02:56:54.880 --> 02:56:58.560
the hidden pages, but those will be exclusive for the listeners of the show. You'll have

02:56:58.560 --> 02:57:02.880
exclusive DWIs before everyone else. So, enjoy.

02:57:02.880 --> 02:57:10.200
There's actually a pretty decent StepMania theme that was posted on stepmania.com. It's

02:57:10.200 --> 02:57:17.580
called Forever Blue 2.0 or something. I would say it's a very different take on the themes

02:57:17.580 --> 02:57:22.200
you're used to. It's more of like a gothic type theme. The freeze arrows are like blue

02:57:22.200 --> 02:57:26.320
and stuff like that it's all pretty it's actually a pretty interesting one if you

02:57:26.320 --> 02:57:30.500
download it just to see it if anything that was done by healing vision one of

02:57:30.500 --> 02:57:34.900
the best fucking artists out there and really awesome sim file maker makes

02:57:34.900 --> 02:57:44.820
everything just like official Konami mix so yeah what's up when made announcer

02:57:44.820 --> 02:57:50.160
packs no actually twin all he did was he ripped announcers and he ripped up the

02:57:50.160 --> 02:57:53.760
thing in fact he was actually bitching about that was one of the things he

02:57:53.760 --> 02:57:56.880
bitches about me know a while back is he wanted me to send the announcer stuff

02:57:56.880 --> 02:58:00.340
whatever you know that's cool that he released the announcers for solo and

02:58:00.340 --> 02:58:05.220
shit even though I can lady oh yeah I have those on my computer I could have

02:58:05.220 --> 02:58:08.400
released him at any point but you know I just don't care instead I'm just gonna

02:58:08.400 --> 02:58:12.280
release them all at once it really doesn't matter to me he doesn't bother

02:58:12.280 --> 02:58:18.840
me at all him him with his his announcer packs in high quality high res banners

02:58:18.840 --> 02:58:22.840
That's all he can rip from the poor DDR discs.

02:58:22.840 --> 02:58:24.840
How did he even get them?

02:58:24.840 --> 02:58:26.840
It's just the same way I get them.

02:58:26.840 --> 02:58:28.840
You just rip them from the arcade discs.

02:58:28.840 --> 02:58:30.840
You know someone who gets the disc images.

02:58:30.840 --> 02:58:31.840
Whoop-dee-doo.

02:58:31.840 --> 02:58:33.840
So off of his Korean two discs, well guess what?

02:58:33.840 --> 02:58:35.840
I own an official one.

02:58:35.840 --> 02:58:37.840
Not that I care. Whatever.

02:58:37.840 --> 02:58:39.840
Yeah, go ahead. Release your banners and stuff.

02:58:39.840 --> 02:58:42.840
I'll release my site with 2,000 DWIs on it.

02:58:42.840 --> 02:58:44.840
Yeah.

02:58:44.840 --> 02:58:46.840
Alright.

02:58:46.840 --> 02:59:03.080
me a follow-up. Angel says you want to email your AOL account?

02:59:03.080 --> 02:59:06.920
One other quick thing I want to talk about before we go off the air tonight is waste

02:59:06.920 --> 02:59:14.640
of time websites. We were talking about neopets.com. What a fucking waste of time. It's worse than

02:59:14.640 --> 02:59:18.920
Animal Crossing.

02:59:18.920 --> 02:59:22.360
This site is the best website ever.

02:59:22.360 --> 02:59:26.440
It's madox.xmission.com.

02:59:26.440 --> 02:59:35.560
It's madox.xmission.com and that's got the crazy guy who rants about different things

02:59:35.560 --> 02:59:39.020
and he has some really funny ones on there.

02:59:39.020 --> 02:59:41.440
So definitely check those out.

02:59:41.440 --> 02:59:46.440
the one that's funny is one that um Vandalous posted in the Saki Mani forms

02:59:46.440 --> 02:59:51.440
the one where they had the little Mario like video that the guy made it was um

02:59:51.440 --> 02:59:56.880
it's called like Mac Daddy Mario was the was the topic on Saki Mani and the guy

02:59:56.880 --> 03:00:01.120
actually went and made a bunch of little videos and movies using Nintendo

03:00:01.120 --> 03:00:06.240
characters it's actually pretty cool they have like like one Mario's dancing

03:00:06.240 --> 03:00:11.000
to like disco music and then each comes up to him and they're all and they start

03:00:11.000 --> 03:00:16.940
dancing together, so it's actually pretty good, if not kind of cheesy.

03:00:16.940 --> 03:00:23.240
Thesmokinggun.com. It's news, but it's really cool. And The Onion.

03:00:23.240 --> 03:00:27.700
A new one that came up this week, nationstates.net. Yes, Dan does that.

03:00:27.700 --> 03:00:31.700
Have you made your nation yet? I haven't yet, but Dan's done his Gunstaria.

03:00:31.700 --> 03:00:39.260
Oh, okay. You know what? The DDR crew's got this lazy college students. There's a whole

03:00:39.260 --> 03:00:43.620
much of Omani people getting into this thing. I'm even on it now. The queendom of Batston

03:00:43.620 --> 03:00:45.940
is up. That's mine.

03:00:45.940 --> 03:00:47.900
Maybe I should do Saqib Emaniyeh.

03:00:47.900 --> 03:00:53.020
Hey, that'll be cool. You make your own nation and then you decide on issues and you run

03:00:53.020 --> 03:00:57.860
it and you can be like an evil dictatorship or you can be Loki and telly your thing.

03:00:57.860 --> 03:00:58.860
Telly your thing.

03:00:58.860 --> 03:01:02.740
You know, I used to do something like that when I was in middle school. We would create

03:01:02.740 --> 03:01:05.140
our countries and run it and everything and then we'd have a war.

03:01:05.140 --> 03:01:12.980
That was funny, the way my country, or we did this thing in sociology, trying to depict

03:01:12.980 --> 03:01:17.980
the best way society should be run, and the way it would work the best, and mine ended

03:01:17.980 --> 03:01:23.740
up turning into, I don't know, neo-naziism.

03:01:23.740 --> 03:01:27.100
That's the way mine was, but it worked, I don't know.

03:01:27.100 --> 03:01:29.100
Maybe there's something to it.

03:01:29.100 --> 03:01:34.740
I probably have a nice social estate.

03:01:34.740 --> 03:01:38.220
Alright, I think we've got to wrap up the show now, because we're running over a little

03:01:38.220 --> 03:01:39.220
bit.

03:01:39.220 --> 03:01:44.620
I wanted to do the nation of Pacmania, and have the currency be the dot.

03:01:44.620 --> 03:01:45.620
That's cool.

03:01:45.620 --> 03:01:46.620
Can't you make more than one?

03:01:46.620 --> 03:01:48.740
And the national animal be the ghost monster.

03:01:48.740 --> 03:01:49.740
Oh.

03:01:49.740 --> 03:01:54.740
Alright, we're running over a little bit, so final thoughts.

03:01:54.740 --> 03:01:57.580
You dropped pussy all over.

03:01:57.580 --> 03:02:02.300
Zero, any final thoughts for the day?

03:02:02.300 --> 03:02:07.300
Not really. Just, I don't know, play more DDR and listen to the next shows.

03:02:07.300 --> 03:02:11.300
I don't know. I'm dumb right now. Don't worry.

03:02:11.300 --> 03:02:16.300
All work and no play makes me you.

03:02:16.300 --> 03:02:17.300
Jamie?

03:02:17.300 --> 03:02:22.300
Shrimp chips own your soul. It tastes like pussy.

03:02:22.300 --> 03:02:23.300
Loki?

03:02:23.300 --> 03:02:28.300
I've had a headache for 24 hours and so I can't wait till tomorrow.

03:02:28.300 --> 03:02:34.300
almost got some last night. That close, that close. Story of my life, alright goodnight

And now, here's your fortune cookie message of the day.

03:03:07.200 --> 03:03:09.200
Water rolls round stairs.

03:03:09.200 --> 03:03:10.200
A boner and pears.

03:03:10.200 --> 03:03:12.200
Pulls over your neighbor's dog.

03:03:12.200 --> 03:03:13.200
Looks great for a snack.

03:03:13.200 --> 03:03:14.200
It fits on your back.

03:03:14.200 --> 03:03:16.200
It's long, long, long.

03:03:16.200 --> 03:03:18.200
It's long, long.

03:03:18.200 --> 03:03:20.200
It's big, it's heavy, it's wood.

03:03:20.200 --> 03:03:22.200
It's long, long.

03:03:22.200 --> 03:03:24.200
It's better than that, it's good.

03:03:24.200 --> 03:03:26.200
Everyone wants a long.

03:03:26.200 --> 03:03:28.200
You're gonna love it long.

03:03:28.200 --> 03:03:30.200
Come on and get your long.

03:03:30.200 --> 03:03:31.200
Everyone needs a long.

03:03:31.200 --> 03:03:43.480
