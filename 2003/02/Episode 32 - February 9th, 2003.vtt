01:09.000 --> 01:12.000
Why did they have to take the word gay?

01:12.000 --> 01:16.000
No! What I expect for punishing positions is Hindu.

11:52.060 --> 11:53.220
You say that every fucking time.

11:53.220 --> 11:56.460
I know, that's why I have to say it, because Dave pointed that out one day.

11:56.460 --> 11:59.900
You say that every goddamn time you play it, bro!

11:59.900 --> 12:01.900
I didn't say it in that tone, though.

12:01.900 --> 12:05.420
Well, I make things up on this show.

12:05.420 --> 12:12.420
My best example of singing is the most fabulous, wonderful, ideal of suck I've ever heard.

12:12.420 --> 12:17.420
We're re-bringing that promo back because American Idol is back.

12:17.420 --> 12:20.420
So we have to play that promo again more.

12:20.420 --> 12:22.420
Everybody watch American Idol.

12:22.420 --> 12:24.420
We need our funky 70's porn music.

12:24.420 --> 12:29.420
We're going to start off with the match game first thing here tonight, but we're going to need to get some contestants.

12:29.420 --> 12:35.340
So, the trivia question we're asking tonight to get some contestants for Latch Game, you

12:35.340 --> 12:37.700
got something that people will get pretty easy.

12:37.700 --> 12:38.700
Okay.

12:38.700 --> 12:39.700
Um.

12:39.700 --> 12:41.660
First two people to private message me the answer.

12:41.660 --> 12:44.540
I'm known in the chat room tonight as Sky Chat Room Slut.

12:44.540 --> 12:45.540
Okay.

12:45.540 --> 12:46.540
This is a question.

12:46.540 --> 12:48.740
It's actually a trivia question about myself.

12:48.740 --> 12:49.740
Okay.

12:49.740 --> 12:50.740
Alright.

12:50.740 --> 12:51.740
What is the one beverage...

12:51.740 --> 12:52.740
No.

12:52.740 --> 12:53.740
I can't do that.

12:53.740 --> 12:55.740
I can't do that.

12:55.740 --> 12:57.140
Okay.

12:57.140 --> 12:59.640
First two people with the correct answer are our contestants tonight.

12:59.640 --> 13:01.640
What is Jamie's favorite tax song?

13:01.640 --> 13:04.940
Ooh, that's going to be a hard one, don't you think?

13:04.940 --> 13:05.940
If they pay attention, you think?

13:05.940 --> 13:06.940
If they pay attention, they'll get it.

13:06.940 --> 13:10.340
Alright, Jamie's favorite tax song.

13:10.340 --> 13:13.260
Send it to me over private message.

13:13.260 --> 13:16.300
And the first two people who got it right get to participate tonight.

13:16.300 --> 13:20.460
So in the meantime, while we wait for those answers to come in, what do we want to talk

13:20.460 --> 13:21.460
about?

13:21.460 --> 13:23.460
Oh yes, let's talk about the contest.

13:23.460 --> 13:24.460
Yes.

13:24.460 --> 13:26.620
First of all, what inspired the pre-show that we did tonight?

13:26.620 --> 13:29.100
I ran out of ideas.

13:29.100 --> 13:33.740
So, for those that just joined us and missed the pre-show, tell us what we did tonight.

13:33.740 --> 13:35.620
Um, old TV show theme songs.

13:35.620 --> 13:41.720
Old TV show theme songs. Many of which that were donated by DDR Angel and Stracer. Next week you should play Eurobeat.

13:41.720 --> 13:44.000
Yes, I will. Eurobeat.

13:44.000 --> 13:45.620
Go! Beat beat.

13:45.620 --> 13:46.940
Off a song!

13:46.940 --> 13:51.780
I'll just play the whole Parapara soundtrack. How's that sound? Like, all music from Initial D.

13:51.780 --> 13:54.780
Okay, I lost all 17 of my Initial D soundtracks.

13:54.780 --> 13:57.780
Okay, next time Jamie takes a week off, you can do pre-show.

13:57.780 --> 13:58.780
How's that, Matt?

13:58.780 --> 14:00.780
Am I gonna take a week off?

14:00.780 --> 14:01.780
Thank you.

14:01.780 --> 14:02.780
That's beautiful.

14:02.780 --> 14:03.780
Okay, um...

14:03.780 --> 14:06.780
No, no, next week's pre-show is Strong Bad Things.

14:06.780 --> 14:09.780
Okay, um, so let me think.

14:09.780 --> 14:10.780
Uh, what else?

14:10.780 --> 14:11.780
The contest!

14:11.780 --> 14:12.780
The contest!

14:12.780 --> 14:13.780
So, great idea.

14:13.780 --> 14:16.780
We have to, uh, give Mitch thanks to Dark Tetsuya for this idea.

14:16.780 --> 14:17.780
This is a great idea.

14:17.780 --> 14:25.780
Orange Lounge Radio is going to be hosting our own DWI contest, because we're going to do this right, god damn it, we're going to do a DWI contest and it's going to kick ass.

14:25.780 --> 14:39.780
And the theme is, you have to do a DWI complete with backgrounds, basic trick and maniac steps, and banners, the whole nine yards, to any old TV theme.

14:39.780 --> 14:45.780
Or actually no, any TV theme you want to do. Two minutes at the most, if it's longer than two minutes you better crop it down.

14:45.780 --> 14:49.700

Uh, we need a tentative deadline right now so we can iron out all the rules and shit.

15:54.280 --> 15:55.280
Uh huh?

15:55.280 --> 16:01.120
You need to, um, iron out, you know, what the rules and stuff would be.

16:01.120 --> 16:06.440
Okay, so we'll just tell everybody they're going to have to look on the forums for the

16:06.440 --> 16:07.440
information.

16:07.440 --> 16:09.960
Okay, American, Canadian, or British.

16:09.960 --> 16:12.980
So this is the deal.

16:12.980 --> 16:15.400
We don't know how we want to submit these yet, but that's okay.

16:15.400 --> 16:19.200
Just go work on them and we'll have more details for you next week.

16:19.200 --> 16:23.340
Next week's show, by the way, Jamie's going to be here, and Loki, you're going to be here

16:23.340 --> 16:24.340

16:24.340 --> 16:25.340
I will not.

16:25.340 --> 16:26.340
I will.

16:26.340 --> 16:29.540
I'm going to be in L.A. at the Cyberbeat tournament.

16:29.540 --> 16:30.540
I'll set it all up.

16:30.540 --> 16:34.240
I've already got a way where they can send the files to me.

16:34.240 --> 16:37.620
So we'll set something up and we'll have more information for you next week.

16:37.620 --> 16:44.360
And if anyone still remembers leechfromloki.tk, do not go there, because that is the most

16:44.360 --> 16:47.620
disturbing picture I've ever seen in my entire life.

16:47.620 --> 16:48.620
Actually...

16:48.620 --> 16:49.620
Yeah, whatever, blah blah blah.

16:49.620 --> 16:50.620
We'll talk about it later.

16:50.620 --> 16:51.620
That was funny though, but yeah.

16:51.620 --> 16:52.620
Yeah, whatever.

16:52.620 --> 17:00.440
Anyway, but the correct address for Loki's site is www.willddrforfood.net slash leechfromloki.

17:00.440 --> 17:06.040
So anyway, so now you know, we're doing a DWI contest, and the judges will be, of course,

17:06.040 --> 17:09.080
myself, Jamie and Loki.

17:09.080 --> 17:10.120
That sound good?

17:10.120 --> 17:10.920
That's because we're cool.

17:10.920 --> 17:15.920
And maybe we'll get... We're cooler than everybody in the world! We'll get an Aoki or somebody from Cali Bumani to judge to.

17:15.920 --> 17:18.220
We'll get a fourth judge from them.

17:18.220 --> 17:22.840
And yes, the site's not done yet. Yes, I know, I promised to have the site done about a month ago or two

17:22.840 --> 17:25.200
months ago. I don't even care anymore.

17:25.200 --> 17:26.800
I'm just lazy

17:26.800 --> 17:31.360
and I'm not doing it right away because it's a lot of fucking work and I need...

17:31.360 --> 17:33.160
Yeah, it's just like...

17:33.160 --> 17:36.520
It's tedious and I get distracted easily and

17:36.520 --> 17:40.160
just insert excuse here.

17:40.160 --> 17:43.960
Evil Naoki says he's judging, so that's it, that's our fourth judge, Evil Naoki, we got it.

17:43.960 --> 17:47.200

25:16.520 --> 25:17.680
That's a very good observation, Brad.

25:17.680 --> 25:20.040
They all have to do with penetration of some sort.

25:22.320 --> 25:23.780
Billy's is implied though.

25:23.780 --> 25:26.780
Just because you're gay, you don't have to fuck me.

25:26.780 --> 25:29.780
Yeah, that's right. Just because you're gay doesn't mean you have to fuck people in the ass.

25:29.780 --> 25:32.780
Yeah, I think that you can be gay and not a slut.

25:37.780 --> 25:38.780

28:22.260 --> 28:26.260
Are you a racist? Do you like to suck cock?

28:26.260 --> 28:30.260
Why do you think I don't watch TV?

28:30.260 --> 28:34.260
Okay, my turn.

28:34.260 --> 28:38.260
Starting off

28:38.260 --> 28:42.260
with Dark Sakura. JB was shocked when he got a CD of

28:42.260 --> 28:46.260
Yoko Ono's Greatest Hits.

28:46.260 --> 28:50.260
Good answer, but not a match. I'm sorry to say.

28:50.260 --> 28:57.260
It was giving me glares for insinuating that he was a homo for knowing about Kidz Bop.

29:00.260 --> 29:05.260
Anyways, so he was shocked to see the CD that he got because...

29:05.260 --> 29:10.260
It doesn't matter because Jenny Rom sucks, okay?

29:10.260 --> 29:14.260
Ooh, you can send those cards and letters to Loki!

29:14.260 --> 29:18.260
Care of willdyrforfood.net slash leash from Loki.

29:18.260 --> 29:25.260
Billy, he was shocked to see that they sent him a CD of The Original Artists.

29:26.260 --> 29:33.260
Oh, I think Billy gets a zing for that. The Original Artists.

29:36.260 --> 29:43.260
That was funny. Alright, but not a match. Good answer, though.

29:43.260 --> 29:57.260
Alright, but not a match. Good answer though. Zero. He was shocked to see that they set him a CD of the best and worst of American Idol, which is pretty much the same.

29:57.260 --> 30:04.260
Good answer, not a match. Sorry. Our dynamic duo over here, Brad and Dave.

30:04.260 --> 30:05.260
shocked

30:05.260 --> 30:08.420
shocked to see

30:08.420 --> 30:12.300
shocked to see that he got a CD of

30:12.300 --> 30:19.300
Rafi

30:22.260 --> 30:26.140
he used to sing children's songs on stage

30:26.140 --> 30:27.420
no the elephant show

30:27.420 --> 30:28.660
banana phone

30:28.660 --> 30:29.620
doo doo doo

30:29.620 --> 30:32.620
banana phone

30:32.620 --> 30:34.620
No, there isn't.

30:34.620 --> 30:35.620
Oh, never mind.

30:35.620 --> 30:37.620
I mean, it's Rafi though, dang.

30:37.620 --> 30:40.620
You guys won the match game just for that alone.

30:40.620 --> 30:42.620
All right.

30:42.620 --> 30:46.620
My answer, my answer actually has a musical cue to go with it.

30:46.620 --> 30:51.620
He was shocked to see that they sent him a CD of Avril Lavigne's speed covers.

30:51.620 --> 30:58.620
I'm gonna go kill myself now, bye.

31:03.300 --> 31:07.460
There's a bottle of Propel you can choke on.

31:07.460 --> 31:11.460
Okay. You were shocked to see the Cinema CD of Avril Lavigne's newcomers.

31:11.460 --> 31:14.260
Rob, put it right in your hand.

31:14.260 --> 31:17.900
I got slapped on the wrist for that one.

31:17.900 --> 31:19.620
Alright.

31:19.620 --> 31:23.620
Okay, you lose. You are loser!

31:23.620 --> 31:28.620
So it's all tied up, 0-0.

31:28.620 --> 31:32.620
Alright, next question, here we go.

31:32.620 --> 31:35.620
Let's see if we can get one on the board here.

31:35.620 --> 31:40.620
Jamie loves Propel more than any drink in the whole world.

31:40.620 --> 31:44.620
She decided though one day to write the company and tell them,

31:44.620 --> 31:49.620
Dear Propel, you really need to make blank flavor.

31:49.620 --> 31:58.620
People who know what my favorite drink is don't get it.

31:58.620 --> 32:02.620
Should I ask that joke?

32:02.620 --> 32:04.620
Yes, I like ass flavor.

32:04.620 --> 32:12.620
Thank you.

32:12.620 --> 32:16.620
We're waiting for the contestants to lock in. Are all the celebrities in?

32:16.620 --> 32:18.620
Oh, they're singing.

32:18.620 --> 32:21.620
Okay, dear Propel, you really need to make blank flavor.

32:24.620 --> 32:26.620
Actually, that makes me think of...

32:26.620 --> 32:29.620
And today's contestants take home...

32:29.620 --> 32:31.620
Rice-a-roni, the San Francisco treat.

32:31.620 --> 32:32.620
Ding ding!

32:32.620 --> 32:34.620
Rice-a-roni, the San Francisco treat.

32:34.620 --> 32:37.620
Alright, our contestants are locked in. How about the celebrities?

32:37.620 --> 32:38.620
Still thinking?

32:38.620 --> 32:41.620
Just think, what's a flavor of Propel that Jamie would want?

32:41.620 --> 32:48.620
Okay, we're still waiting on a couple of liberties. Zero's writing. Billy, come on.

32:51.620 --> 32:55.620
I should answer that.

32:55.620 --> 32:58.620
Okay, we'll have Jamie answer that.

32:58.620 --> 33:04.620
I'll let you try my turn, because I'm the best, the greatest, and everyone loves me.

33:04.620 --> 33:06.620
The chat room has a lot of good answers here.

33:06.620 --> 33:07.620
Like what?

33:07.620 --> 33:08.620
it?

33:08.620 --> 33:09.620
Uh, bukkake.

33:09.620 --> 33:10.620
No!

33:10.620 --> 33:11.620
S'woon cream.

33:11.620 --> 33:12.620
Sort of salty.

33:12.620 --> 33:13.620
School girl.

33:13.620 --> 33:14.620
Probably like sweaty palms.

33:14.620 --> 33:15.620
School girl flavor.

33:15.620 --> 33:16.620
Okay.

33:16.620 --> 33:17.620
Billy's locked in.

33:17.620 --> 33:18.620
Good.

33:18.620 --> 33:19.620
Alright.

33:19.620 --> 33:20.620
Okay.

33:20.620 --> 33:21.620
Let's read the answers.

33:21.620 --> 33:22.620
First, EOSFBB.

33:22.620 --> 33:33.620
EOSFBB goes first this time.

33:33.620 --> 33:34.780
first this time

33:34.780 --> 33:36.700
dear propel you really need to make

33:36.700 --> 33:39.500
ass flavor

33:39.500 --> 33:41.420
ass flavor beautiful

33:41.420 --> 33:44.700
black lapd says dear propel you really need to make

33:44.700 --> 33:46.360
tak flavor

33:46.360 --> 33:49.420
uh... very good tak flavor good answer

33:49.420 --> 33:52.440
also matched with angel and dark tetsuya

33:52.440 --> 33:56.740
both said that in the chat room at different points but you don't get a point for them

33:56.740 --> 34:01.220
and uh... ohayo bemani makes a good point lemon flavored is ass flavored

34:01.220 --> 34:03.160
yes

34:03.160 --> 34:07.240
okay here we go let's see so jamie you are going to go first and this would be

34:07.240 --> 34:10.240
the correct answer hypothetically

34:10.240 --> 34:13.600
as much as i enjoyed the thought of tax-flavored pocari

34:13.600 --> 34:15.240
my answer is pocari sweat

34:15.240 --> 34:19.520
uh... pocari sweat flavored okay good good

34:19.520 --> 34:24.080
you know it's actually going to be mentioned in my puppy of the week later on

34:24.080 --> 34:28.560
all right moving on loki

34:28.560 --> 34:35.360
I had Blood of a Virgin on there as a flavor, but I'm just going Vanilla Coke flavor.

34:35.360 --> 34:40.860
I'm sorry, Blood of a Virgin wouldn't be good because I don't want to do that in your tent.

34:40.860 --> 34:45.360
All right, so we had Vanilla Coke flavor.

34:45.360 --> 34:47.060
That's not a bad answer, not a bad answer.

34:47.060 --> 34:48.060
All right, Billy.

34:48.060 --> 34:49.560
Cream of Sung Young Guy.

34:49.560 --> 34:52.260
Cream of Sung Young Guy flavor.

34:52.260 --> 34:54.460
Good answer, but not a match, sorry.

34:54.460 --> 34:56.260
All right, zero.

34:56.260 --> 35:01.260
sadly enough i did write ass

35:01.260 --> 35:04.020
wait did Billy say some young guy or some

35:04.020 --> 35:09.140
i thought it was like some young guy is that some japanese food or something

35:09.140 --> 35:10.660
no i just

35:10.660 --> 35:12.260
no i have seen it

35:12.260 --> 35:14.460
i didn't comment on that

35:14.460 --> 35:16.020
okay

35:16.020 --> 35:18.380
i want to say what?

35:18.380 --> 35:20.060
as he just says what?

35:20.060 --> 35:23.100
as he just says what?

35:23.100 --> 35:24.100
exactly

35:24.100 --> 35:25.420
okay uh...

35:25.420 --> 35:30.620
ours was ochre

35:30.620 --> 35:32.780
uh...

35:32.780 --> 35:34.220
uh... okay

35:34.220 --> 35:37.820
and my answer because i guess that you need a lot of it was huge or maybe

35:37.820 --> 35:40.860
shorter review if i could be flavored

35:40.860 --> 35:43.760
i never had never a day

35:43.760 --> 35:46.800
although what i would

35:46.800 --> 35:48.820
and i want to make my hand

35:48.820 --> 35:49.960
and then it's with it

35:49.960 --> 35:52.500
later i don't know when it dries right here

35:52.500 --> 35:59.500
and then i would go to people and feel it back

36:02.040 --> 36:04.440
all right

36:04.440 --> 36:08.440
so we had a point we did get finally one point two yes so you know that he

36:08.440 --> 36:12.240
basically by one point

36:12.240 --> 36:14.200
okay

36:14.200 --> 36:18.220
it's not about being right it's about the money okay

36:18.220 --> 36:20.180

Billy, what should they do?

38:21.000 --> 38:24.320
Answer any Kylie song here.

If you knew Billy, you knew, just go with Kylie Minogue. That's all you had to do. Now, this is the funny thing.

38:29.520 --> 38:35.520
Kylie Minogue shows up on all those Dance Mania albums, but they have not put her in DDR yet.

39:20.880 --> 39:22.880
It's a sexual position, isn't it?

39:22.880 --> 39:26.880

39:46.880 --> 39:48.880
Billy the big homosexual loved to play Game of Monet songs

39:48.880 --> 39:50.880
he really wished they would put

39:50.880 --> 39:52.880

42:13.360 --> 42:15.600
Are you rating your Ray-Par light around?

42:15.600 --> 42:19.600
I wonder if we're getting a big, long paragraph or something.

42:19.600 --> 42:23.600
Jamie knows it's all in good fun.

42:23.600 --> 42:27.600
But she reserves the right to cut you.

42:27.600 --> 42:31.600
Alright, here we go. Here we go.

42:31.600 --> 42:35.600
We'll start off with the person in the lead. We predict on next week's Drunk Show,

42:35.600 --> 42:39.600
EOSFBB says Jamie is going to get so drunk that she ends up

42:39.600 --> 42:43.600
lesbian.

42:43.600 --> 42:46.240
blinks

42:46.240 --> 42:49.440
blacklabs

42:49.440 --> 42:52.080
blacklabs also says lesbian

42:52.080 --> 42:56.340
she's gonna get so drunk she ends up lesbian

42:56.340 --> 42:59.720
is that because we all get gay when we drink?

42:59.720 --> 43:02.040
do i go straight when i drink?

43:02.040 --> 43:03.440
actually i kinda do

43:03.440 --> 43:10.440
okay don't you people know that i already have made the vow that if Dan and i ever break up i'm getting a girlfriend?

43:10.440 --> 43:17.440
I just don't find that anything about that is funny.

43:23.880 --> 43:30.880
Because men love lesbians. Jamie is going to get so drunk she ends up sane, that's a

43:30.880 --> 43:34.440
and that's a good answer

43:34.440 --> 43:37.680
uh... next up looking she ends up

43:37.680 --> 43:41.700
might go

43:41.700 --> 43:43.400
i said let me do it

43:43.400 --> 43:45.440
i think that's why

43:45.440 --> 43:47.360
they get a point

43:47.360 --> 43:49.080
to that

43:49.080 --> 43:53.560
the answer to say thank you are a

43:53.560 --> 43:58.560
belly she ends up

43:58.560 --> 44:00.560
Good answer. Zero. She ends up...

44:00.560 --> 44:04.560
I thought I was going to be original with this, but lesbian is what I came up with.

44:04.560 --> 44:07.560
Two points. Alright.

44:07.560 --> 44:10.560
Yeah, it's too easy. It's the easy answer.

44:10.560 --> 44:14.560
It's the cop-out answer. Brad Dave put...

44:14.560 --> 44:16.560
Do the lead-in.

44:16.560 --> 44:18.560
Jamie's going to get so drunk that she...

44:18.560 --> 44:19.560
Ends up...

44:19.560 --> 44:20.560
Ends up...

44:20.560 --> 44:23.560
Using the microphone. Use your imagination.

44:23.560 --> 44:28.560
I'm sorry, did that hurt?

44:28.560 --> 44:29.560
Okay.

44:29.560 --> 44:42.000
Now mine's, amazingly enough, I think I have the most PG rated answer.

44:42.000 --> 44:48.640
Jamie's going to end up so drunk that she ends up making out with the happy bunny doll.

44:48.640 --> 44:49.640
No mine was, I said same.

44:49.640 --> 44:50.640
Oh that's true, you said same.

44:50.640 --> 44:51.640
You had the G rated answer.

44:51.640 --> 44:55.200
rated

44:55.200 --> 44:56.660
all right so

44:56.660 --> 44:59.860
the final scores let's tally them up

44:59.860 --> 45:02.500
black lab has two points

45:02.500 --> 45:07.380
u s f e b wins tonight with three points congratulation and a bottle of propel

45:07.380 --> 45:08.820
you win nothing

45:08.820 --> 45:13.740
but you have a lot of help if you have to buy yourself okay great

45:13.740 --> 45:15.460
beautiful

45:15.460 --> 45:16.380
thank you

45:16.380 --> 45:21.380
Our show was brought to you by Propel and Balls, which somebody needs to come and bring me some balls.

45:21.380 --> 45:22.380
I love balls.

45:22.380 --> 45:23.380
No rave, please.

45:25.380 --> 45:29.380
The light switch was installed, so you could turn the light on and off.

45:29.380 --> 45:31.380
Not that you can throw a license, Rave!

45:59.380 --> 46:01.380
I'm gonna do cage match next.

46:09.380 --> 46:11.380
I already know that I'm going to win.

46:13.380 --> 46:15.380
I already know that I'm going to win.

46:22.380 --> 46:24.380
I didn't win last time.

46:24.380 --> 46:26.380
I got deeper inside the passing song.

46:26.380 --> 46:29.380
Did I get dethroned by the cussing song last week?

46:29.380 --> 46:31.380
Didn't the cussing song win last week?

46:31.380 --> 46:33.380
I won, didn't I?

46:33.380 --> 46:36.380
Oh, well, god damn it, I think it's a good song.

46:36.380 --> 46:38.380
Yeah.

46:38.380 --> 46:41.380
Well, I can dethrone it myself.

46:46.380 --> 46:50.380
I'll take a different song.

46:52.380 --> 46:55.380
Why don't we just play it during this break?

46:55.380 --> 46:56.100
Yeah, why not?

46:56.100 --> 47:02.180
Okay, then we'll save, because I haven't gotten the answer on JB's mix if it was him or not, so I'll wait on that, and in the meantime, we'll play-

47:02.180 --> 47:03.700
It's the song that Puppy sent me.

47:03.700 --> 47:06.020
Okay, so what is this? Describe this for us, JB.

47:06.020 --> 47:10.020
Um, I don't think it needs any description. Just play it.

47:10.020 --> 47:11.700
No description needed, huh?

47:11.700 --> 47:12.180
Yeah.

47:12.180 --> 47:12.660
Alright.

47:12.660 --> 47:13.460
It's just a cool song.

47:14.100 --> 47:18.980
Okay, we're gonna, uh, we're gonna play this, and we'll be right back. We'll play this and another quick song, and then we'll be back.

47:18.980 --> 47:21.580
on orange lounge radio with the cage

47:48.980 --> 47:53.980
Say that I'm gonna get through this I'm gonna get through this

47:53.980 --> 47:56.980
I gotta take I gotta take my mind off of you

47:56.980 --> 47:59.980
Give me just a second then I'll be alright

47:59.980 --> 48:03.980
Show them what my moment could've read my heart

48:03.980 --> 48:06.980
Give me just a moment then you'll be okay

48:06.980 --> 48:11.980
Just another day and then I'll talk you tight

48:11.980 --> 48:15.980
When your love is pouring like rain I close my eyes and you sorta get away

48:15.980 --> 48:18.980
When I gave you some chance to say I love you

48:18.980 --> 48:20.980
I pretend that you're already mine

48:20.980 --> 48:22.980
So my heart ain't breaking every time

48:22.980 --> 48:24.980
I look into your eyes

48:24.980 --> 48:27.980
It's only I can feel it

48:27.980 --> 48:31.980
It's only I can feel it

48:31.980 --> 48:34.980
It's only I can feel it

48:34.980 --> 48:39.980
Don, Don, you gotta help me get through this

48:39.980 --> 48:41.980
I gotta get through this

48:41.980 --> 48:43.980
I gotta get through this

48:43.980 --> 48:47.380
I gotta make, gonna make it, gonna make it through

48:47.380 --> 48:51.380
Said I'm gonna get through this, I'm gonna get through this

48:51.380 --> 48:54.380
I gotta think, gotta think, my mind ain't got for you

48:54.380 --> 48:57.880
Give me just a second and I'll be alright

48:57.880 --> 49:01.480
Show that when my moment couldn't break my heart

49:01.480 --> 49:05.080
Give me a touch of marble then I'll be okay

49:05.080 --> 49:09.580
Just another day and then I'll rock you tight

49:09.580 --> 49:13.580
When your love is pouring like the rain, I close my eyes and it's cold again

49:13.580 --> 49:16.580
When I get some chance to say I love you

49:16.580 --> 49:19.580
I pretend that you're ready, but I know my heart ain't breaking

49:19.580 --> 49:22.580
Every time my life is through, you're right

49:22.580 --> 49:25.580
It's only I can do it

49:25.580 --> 49:29.580
It's only I can do it

49:29.580 --> 49:32.580
It's only I can do it

49:32.580 --> 49:35.580
I'm gone, gotta help me get out of here

51:05.580 --> 51:35.560
Hi Ho, Kermit the Frog here, informing you that

51:35.560 --> 51:42.560
Today's broadcast of Orange Lounge Radio is brought to you by B, A, and No. 59.

52:05.560 --> 52:11.560
So, we're back and we're chilling. How are y'all doing? How was your week?

52:11.560 --> 52:15.560
Dot, dot, dot, dot. I don't know what they're doing in the other

52:15.560 --> 52:18.560
room. I hope my roommate's not starting to sleep. Is he? Okay, good. He's not.

52:18.560 --> 52:22.560
My week was a big pile of ass. Why? What happened?

52:22.560 --> 52:28.560
No, I don't know. It was okay. I got into some hanging out and did lots of

52:28.560 --> 52:33.560
busy, rocky things. I went costume hunting a bunch. I still get front damn globe.

52:33.560 --> 52:35.560
You know, we haven't done our fuck-yous.

52:35.560 --> 52:37.560
We can do the fuck-yous. We'll do the fuck-yous a little later.

52:37.560 --> 52:40.560
We always do the fuck-yous towards the beginning. I figure we'll save it towards the end.

52:40.560 --> 52:42.560
And last night was just insane.

52:43.560 --> 52:48.560
I think that I don't remember much of last night because I was not feeling happy.

52:48.560 --> 52:51.560
Last night was crazy. Yes, yes, definitely.

52:51.560 --> 52:53.560
And you were fabulous.

52:53.560 --> 52:54.560
Thank you.

52:54.560 --> 52:59.560
For those that don't know, we're here in Orange Orange World Radio headquarters in Sacramento, California.

52:59.560 --> 53:03.320
California. A lot of us that are involved here with the show are also involved

53:03.320 --> 53:06.600
with the local production of Rocky Orpix show, so we were doing that last night

53:06.600 --> 53:10.580
and that was a lot of energy. So if we seem a little dead tonight, we're still

53:10.580 --> 53:14.560
kind of recovering from last night. However, Jamie was kind enough to go to

53:14.560 --> 53:19.240
Walgreens and get some double shots drinks of those coffee things. Starbucks double shots.

53:19.240 --> 53:23.360
Yes. So actually this episode of Orange Lodge Radio not only is brought to you

53:23.360 --> 53:33.360
It's brought to you by Starbuck's Double Shot Theater Drink.

53:33.360 --> 53:35.360
Bitter Ass Coffee.

53:35.360 --> 53:37.360
What was your week, Loki?

53:37.360 --> 53:40.360
I went and played Qs last night.

53:40.360 --> 53:43.360
Oh, didn't you have a story about this?

53:43.360 --> 53:47.360
You've got plenty of FUs besides this. Come on, tell the story.

53:47.360 --> 53:53.360
Yesterday was interesting. Yeah, Zero went with me, so he can, you know, okay.

53:53.360 --> 53:54.360
It was great.

53:54.360 --> 54:00.360
It was good. Vacaville, you know, it's really close, a lot closer than Concord or Pleasanton.

54:00.360 --> 54:01.360
Stay away.

54:01.360 --> 54:08.360
It was nice. Now, the bowling alley, it's actually in SARS Entertainment, like, it's like a bowling alley type place.

54:08.360 --> 54:13.360
They've got, like, a nice restaurant in there and, like, pizza and an arcade and stuff.

54:13.360 --> 54:20.360
And I'm sure I'll go into this with my FUs later on, but they had Fifth Mix and Max2 there, both in really poor condition.

54:20.360 --> 54:21.360
Very poor.

54:21.360 --> 54:30.360
Everything was broken there. Even the soda machine was pretty much all randomized. You'd pick one soda and get something else.

54:30.360 --> 54:35.360
The soda machine was like roulette. If you touched it, you didn't get what you wanted.

54:35.360 --> 54:52.360
The arena was awesome, the packs were in good condition, but it was the worst run Qsar ever. And there was annoying people there. Vacaville was full of hicks and wannabe gangsters.

54:52.360 --> 54:59.360
Thanks

55:00.000 --> 55:01.800
it was interesting it was

55:01.800 --> 55:03.060
it became

55:03.060 --> 55:08.360
more fun later on when all the stupid people started leaving

55:08.360 --> 55:11.400
so that and the lack of sleep I've been doing the last few days

55:11.400 --> 55:18.400
because I've been going to bed at like six in the morning and getting like three hours of sleep

55:18.400 --> 55:22.440
As far as my week goes, I've been kind of getting ready for Rocky II, I haven't done

55:22.440 --> 55:23.440
a lot.

55:23.440 --> 55:24.620
I went out and played Bomani I think one time this week.

55:24.620 --> 55:28.120
I found that I'm suddenly, all of a sudden I'm really into DDR Extreme.

55:28.120 --> 55:29.980
Like all of a sudden I'm into DDR again.

55:29.980 --> 55:33.420
And I think a lot of that has to do with Jamie Lomi, her fifth mix.

55:33.420 --> 55:35.140
So I can make some linked data.

55:35.140 --> 55:37.100
So I can make some new linked data for Extreme.

55:37.100 --> 55:39.020
And now I have something to accomplish.

55:39.020 --> 55:41.880
Like oh my gods, I've got to get a double A on this.

55:41.880 --> 55:42.880
We need to re...

55:42.880 --> 55:43.880
I'm sorry?

55:43.880 --> 55:47.680
We need to set our night where we do nothing but DDR.

55:47.680 --> 55:50.320
We kind of used to do those on Friday night, but that physical, well we used to, way in

55:50.320 --> 55:52.760
the day we did it on Wednesday night, but then I started going to karaoke except I'm

55:52.760 --> 55:55.240
not even going anymore, so maybe we could just do Wednesdays again.

55:55.240 --> 55:56.240
So maybe that'll work.

55:56.240 --> 55:57.240
I need to get a copy of Fifth.

55:57.240 --> 55:58.240
I need to start making edits so bad.

55:58.240 --> 56:02.720
I do fourth edits all the time and I'm getting kind of old now.

56:02.720 --> 56:04.480
We can probably get you a copy of Fifth one way or another.

56:04.480 --> 56:07.880
If Jamie lets you, if Jamie lets me keep her copy a little, couple more days, I'll

56:07.880 --> 56:08.880
make you a copy.

56:08.880 --> 56:10.880
I brought you like ten CDs to burn stuff on.

56:10.880 --> 56:11.880
Cool!

56:11.880 --> 56:12.880
So.

56:12.880 --> 56:14.120
Alright, whatever works.

56:14.120 --> 56:16.600
We don't endorse pirating on this show, no we don't.

56:16.600 --> 56:17.600
No.

56:17.600 --> 56:22.280
I'll be honest. I'll be honest. We never really talked about this in Orange Laundry.

56:22.280 --> 56:23.920
Let me talk about my views on pirating games.

56:23.920 --> 56:27.560
As far as my DDR is concerned and the money stuff.

56:27.560 --> 56:30.760
Never the US ones, always the Japanese ones.

56:30.760 --> 56:36.040
And I say it's okay because I think the price you pay to import this stuff is

56:36.040 --> 56:38.280
just outrageous to import this stuff from Japan. And honestly,

56:38.280 --> 56:41.400
if they wanted me to buy it, they'd release it in this country. So I figure if they're not

56:41.400 --> 56:43.560
going to release it in this country, if they're not going to take that effort to

56:43.560 --> 56:47.160
satisfy, you know, our demand by releasing it here, then I'm going to pirate it.

56:47.160 --> 56:55.160
But I have bought every US Bamani release, every one. Even the very crappy first USA mix, I bought it just because I wanted to support Bamani.

56:55.160 --> 56:59.160
And reserved them at Gamestop. The one at Ardent Square Mall.

56:59.160 --> 57:08.160
Even still, I think it's kind of crap that you have to buy their shit that they release in order for them to hopefully bring out better stuff later on. I think that's really stupid.

57:08.160 --> 57:12.160
They did, but DDR Max was pretty good. You have to admit.

57:12.160 --> 57:16.160
It was pretty good, but USA, the first one, sucked ass.

57:16.160 --> 57:20.480
and I played it maybe twice. But I felt okay. This is kind of the way I felt. I said, okay,

57:20.480 --> 57:23.920
I've played all those Japanese ones for free, so I've played all these songs for free.

57:23.920 --> 57:26.560
But did you just see the first one they released in Japan? It was kind of after.

57:26.560 --> 57:29.280
Yeah, the one that we... But it had strictly business.

57:29.280 --> 57:33.680
In comparison, though, to everything since, you know, you have to start somewhere.

57:33.680 --> 57:39.600
I mean, this is an old debate that goes, you know, back about a year now. Was that when

57:39.600 --> 57:44.080
USA was released, about a year ago? More than that. That was a long time ago.

57:44.080 --> 57:48.080
The Disney Mix, the USA one, I played that one time.

57:48.080 --> 57:50.080
Yeah, I had the Disney one.

57:50.080 --> 57:54.080
I just don't even really play those songs, but I bought it just because I had played Disney's Rave a lot.

57:54.080 --> 57:55.080
I think it's like...

57:55.080 --> 57:56.080
So it was kind of my conscious...

57:56.080 --> 57:59.080
Or something at my house. Just set drinks on it.

57:59.080 --> 58:00.080
That's all it took.

58:00.080 --> 58:04.080
I think, I think, uh, Magus, Somnimagus has my copy and doesn't realize it.

58:04.080 --> 58:08.080
I have the Japanese version sitting right in front of the US one in my collection at home.

58:08.080 --> 58:12.800
So, I think I played it one time so I could get the maniac steps, and I wanted to see

58:12.800 --> 58:16.360
how hard the 10-footers were, and then I was unimpressed, so...

58:16.360 --> 58:18.000
Dance magic, nuff said.

58:18.000 --> 58:20.800
Yeah, it's all about dance magic.

58:20.800 --> 58:24.400
So um, yeah, I say it's okay to pirate the Japanese ones.

58:24.400 --> 58:25.400
Rob?

58:25.400 --> 58:26.400
Yeah?

58:26.400 --> 58:27.400
Is this your yo-yo?

58:27.400 --> 58:28.400
No, it's Brian's.

58:28.400 --> 58:29.400
Brian's yo-yo sucks.

58:29.400 --> 58:30.400
I'm sorry.

58:30.400 --> 58:31.400
I'm gonna get you a yo-yo.

58:31.400 --> 58:32.400
You can get Brian a yo-yo.

58:32.400 --> 58:33.400
I'll buy Brian a yo-yo.

58:33.400 --> 58:34.400
Alright.

58:34.400 --> 58:35.400
So...

58:35.400 --> 58:37.400
I want a yo-yo ball right now.

58:37.400 --> 58:40.400
You want to talk Sim stuff?

58:40.400 --> 58:41.400
Sim.

58:41.400 --> 58:43.400
Okay, you want to talk about this?

58:43.400 --> 58:44.400
Alright.

58:44.400 --> 58:45.400
This was just announced this week.

58:45.400 --> 58:48.400
Konami in Japan is making a brand new game.

58:48.400 --> 58:51.400
It's called Aerobics Revolution.

58:51.400 --> 58:54.400
Tell me it doesn't remind you of an old school 8-bit game.

58:54.400 --> 58:55.400
It's dance aerobics.

58:55.400 --> 58:56.400
Yes it is.

58:56.400 --> 58:57.400
It's dance aerobics.

58:57.400 --> 58:58.400
I swear to God it looks just like it.

58:58.400 --> 59:02.400
But basically it's going to be an aerobics game that uses your DDR mat.

59:02.400 --> 59:05.040
You know you love it, and it looks like it has a little DDR SIM mode

59:05.040 --> 59:10.400
They're kind of taking diet mode and making it its own game. I guess I don't know we'd only know much about this

59:11.920 --> 59:13.660
It looks like it's a home one yeah

59:13.660 --> 59:16.700
It's gonna be a home release for PlayStation 2 and it's gonna be out March 13th

59:17.400 --> 59:24.240
And it looks like it probably it kind of looks like it's gonna have like follow the Shadow Dancers kind of like a power mode

59:24.240 --> 59:26.240
So it's probably got like aerobics routines in it

59:27.360 --> 59:29.360
And I'll probably keep track of how well you're doing

59:29.360 --> 59:37.240
doing? By the feet. And you know what? Dance Aerobics was very similar, I thought. So we'll

59:37.240 --> 59:43.000
see. We'll compare when this Aerobics revolution comes out. We'll see how similar it was to

59:43.000 --> 59:46.260
Dance Aerobics. I did play Dance Aerobics one time back in the day. I borrowed a power

59:46.260 --> 59:48.840
pad from my best friend in elementary school. I have a power pad and I have Dance Aerobics.

59:48.840 --> 59:53.720
Do you? And track and field. You know what? On one week on Orange Lounge, we need to have

59:53.720 --> 59:58.640
a power pad night. We need to have the power pad Olympics on Orange Lounge Radio. I kicked

59:58.640 --> 01:00:05.640
Okay, we're gonna do that one night. We'll get a crowd here and we'll move the show out into the other room. We'll have the Power Pad Olympics. How's that sound?

01:00:05.640 --> 01:00:06.640
Okay.

01:00:06.640 --> 01:00:07.640
Alright, cool.

01:00:07.640 --> 01:00:11.640
It looks like the dance aerobics, it looks like it uses all the buttons too.

01:00:11.640 --> 01:00:12.640
All six?

01:00:12.640 --> 01:00:14.640
All six of them, however many there are.

01:00:14.640 --> 01:00:18.640
It looks like there's almost one in the middle. You see how this one has it lit up? But I don't think there's a button on the...

01:00:18.640 --> 01:00:19.640
I don't think they would do that.

01:00:19.640 --> 01:00:22.640
Yeah, I don't know. Maybe it's just showing where your feet are supposed to be.

01:00:22.640 --> 01:00:23.640
Maybe you use it one foot forward to see that.

01:00:23.640 --> 01:00:24.640
A lot of this is speculation.

01:00:24.640 --> 01:00:25.640
We'll link the chat room.

01:00:25.640 --> 01:00:29.640
We'll link the chat room to this, just in case you guys haven't heard about this yet

01:00:29.640 --> 01:00:32.640
and you want to look up the site like we're looking at right now. There it is.

01:00:32.640 --> 01:00:35.640
And if you're not in our chat room, why the hell not?

01:00:35.640 --> 01:00:39.640
Get over to our website, orangelounge.skie.cx and click on chat room.

01:00:39.640 --> 01:00:44.640
This game actually does look pretty interesting.

01:00:44.640 --> 01:00:50.640
I'm definitely going to get it when it's out, so you might get a full review from me.

01:00:50.640 --> 01:00:51.640
Alright, sounds good.

01:00:51.640 --> 01:00:54.840
whatever the fuck happened to marshall beat

01:00:54.840 --> 01:00:58.640
wasn't ok i've seen the marshall beat machine once in arcadia today do you

01:00:58.640 --> 01:00:59.920
have a home version

01:00:59.920 --> 01:01:06.920
do they have a home version of you i played it just this week

01:01:06.920 --> 01:01:08.280
it's like it's horrible

01:01:08.280 --> 01:01:11.880
it has sensors on your hands and legs there's a link to it if you go someone

01:01:11.880 --> 01:01:13.780
selling a bunch of them on ebay

01:01:13.780 --> 01:01:15.200
and they'll send you the

01:01:15.200 --> 01:01:17.720
gun konami site that we actually talked about it

01:01:17.720 --> 01:01:19.560
looks retarded

01:01:19.560 --> 01:01:23.720
It's like you're fighting in dance beat.

01:01:23.720 --> 01:01:25.800
It's interesting.

01:01:25.800 --> 01:01:27.920
When Loki and I were at AI

01:01:27.920 --> 01:01:31.600
a couple weeks ago when we were off one week from the show, we were at Arcade Infinity,

01:01:31.600 --> 01:01:36.080
we saw a Marshall Beat machine and not a damn person playing it the whole time.

01:01:36.080 --> 01:01:39.720
I didn't want to... I thought I'd look like an idiot playing it.

01:01:39.720 --> 01:01:42.560
That didn't stop you from playing PDR.

01:01:42.560 --> 01:01:44.560
It wasn't...

01:01:44.560 --> 01:01:48.760
It's an okay concept, but the music they had going with it was like it didn't match.

01:01:48.760 --> 01:01:55.760
you know you have petite love? You're kicking ass to petite love? What the fuck is that?

01:01:57.840 --> 01:01:58.980
there's actually two

01:01:58.980 --> 01:02:00.420
versions of it for the home now

01:02:00.420 --> 01:02:06.200
they have the first one and I guess they just released the second one recently

01:02:06.200 --> 01:02:08.880
I think they made the sequel before they made the first one

01:02:08.880 --> 01:02:11.600
it was pretty bad

01:02:11.600 --> 01:02:14.640
that just sounds like utter ass

01:02:14.640 --> 01:02:18.100
Marshall Beat is missable basically is what we're all kind of coming to

01:02:18.100 --> 01:02:21.840
consensus. Was there any songs that weren't in DDR on Marshall Beat? Punch Mania.

01:02:21.840 --> 01:02:25.520
Crap. But Gun Mania is cool.

01:02:25.520 --> 01:02:30.120
Gun Mania is cool. Gun Mania is cool. It's the pellet shooting game.

01:02:30.120 --> 01:02:34.760
Gun Mania. They had it in AI but it's always broken.

01:02:34.760 --> 01:02:38.760
I made a joke that I was going to move in there and build a bed in there because it's large enough.

01:02:38.760 --> 01:02:42.240
It's huge.

01:02:42.240 --> 01:02:44.080
uh...

01:02:44.080 --> 01:02:48.360
moving right along

01:02:48.360 --> 01:02:53.440
a look into that after the show or being told chairman

01:02:53.440 --> 01:02:58.920
what else going to do or is anything going on similar looking

01:02:58.920 --> 01:03:00.320
you're talking about some stuff with me

01:03:00.320 --> 01:03:02.960
uh... okay

01:03:02.960 --> 01:03:06.400
uh... they've got another cell two thousand three so going on

01:03:06.400 --> 01:03:07.320
except other

01:03:07.320 --> 01:03:11.020
you get the icon testing

01:03:11.020 --> 01:03:16.460
My site is coming up some day, so that'll be it.

01:03:16.460 --> 01:03:21.500
But my sale's releasing more of the DDR Extreme SIM files.

01:03:21.500 --> 01:03:23.700
You can find them with the backgrounds and all that

01:03:23.700 --> 01:03:24.380
wonderful stuff.

01:03:24.380 --> 01:03:26.540
Are they still having Jesus complex about it?

01:03:26.540 --> 01:03:26.940
I don't know.

01:03:26.940 --> 01:03:28.500
I don't care anymore.

01:03:28.500 --> 01:03:31.700
They're also doing a full re-release on all the old

01:03:31.700 --> 01:03:32.860
official SIM files.

01:03:32.860 --> 01:03:38.020
And they're doing them with the CD banner

01:03:38.020 --> 01:03:46.720
things on there also and then see actually all the DDR extreme ones have

01:03:46.720 --> 01:03:50.060
been released with banners just not Bob Imani style they're on another set but I

01:03:50.060 --> 01:03:53.740
can't remember which one so no help there just look on DDR freak you'll find

01:03:53.740 --> 01:04:00.740
or not here DDR maniacs you'll find a link for it I'm sure the other than

01:04:00.740 --> 01:04:04.740
And that's not too much going on at all.

01:04:04.740 --> 01:04:08.740
It's been incredibly slow.

01:04:08.740 --> 01:04:21.740
No real sim updates. I mean, they had a CSV snapshot update of StepMania that they're working on that was released back on the 16th of January, I think.

01:04:21.740 --> 01:04:28.740
no, 26th of January. And then there's, you know, DWI 2.4 was released a couple weeks

01:04:28.740 --> 01:04:35.180
ago also. So those are brand new. What gives a crap about everything else? I don't know.

01:04:35.180 --> 01:04:43.300
There's nothing going on. Just forget it. Slow. Just watch DDR Maniacs and BimaniSims.com

01:04:43.300 --> 01:04:48.540
for, like, homemade stuff because you'll find the most released stuff there. Bimani style,

01:04:48.540 --> 01:04:53.120
you know you'll find the official stuff there that's pretty much it you know

01:04:53.120 --> 01:04:57.620
check the Japanese sites because there's always all these Japanese sites you guys

01:04:57.620 --> 01:05:04.580
are missing and they have really cool shit on there cool and of course the

01:05:04.580 --> 01:05:09.660
most notable news in the DWI sim file world orange lounge radio is doing a

01:05:09.660 --> 01:05:16.660
contest. Yeah, we're doing a contest. All right. Um, okay, so why not, let's do the

01:05:17.620 --> 01:05:24.620
cage match now? Sure? Sure! Why not? All right, well I gotta queue up some stuff, so fill

01:05:25.300 --> 01:05:29.540
time while I queue up all the cage match stuff. Filling time, filling time, filling up the

01:05:29.540 --> 01:05:34.220
time. What was the funniest thing that happened to you this week, Jamie? Going to rock you

01:05:34.220 --> 01:05:44.220
watching you. Shut up! Shut up! I saw Robin Drag like a big ol' queen. No, it was great.

01:05:44.220 --> 01:05:51.980
You were great. I'm beautiful, dammit. You definitely lit the stage. I'm gonna set this

01:05:51.980 --> 01:06:01.300
stage on fire! Yep, it was flamin' all night. Okay, so, let's start off, uh, just one second,

01:06:01.300 --> 01:06:02.620
We need our theme song.

01:06:02.620 --> 01:06:04.460
Yes, here's the theme song.

01:06:04.460 --> 01:06:06.020
Which, if you were paying attention,

01:06:06.020 --> 01:06:07.660
you know it's Jamie's favorite tax song.

01:06:07.660 --> 01:06:08.260
I'm Owlette.

01:06:08.260 --> 01:06:10.180
Last week in the Orange Lounge Cage Match,

01:06:10.180 --> 01:06:15.180
for the second week in a row, Vincent DeMoure

01:06:15.180 --> 01:06:16.180
won it with Eternity.

01:06:16.180 --> 01:06:18.520
So this is the first song you can vote for in tonight's Cage

01:06:18.520 --> 01:06:19.020
Match.

01:06:19.020 --> 01:06:21.660
By the way, if you're new to this, you join our chat room,

01:06:21.660 --> 01:06:25.340

Or you can email them to OrangeLoungeRadioYahoo.com.

01:06:28.300 --> 01:06:31.260
Email the song you like best out of the three you hear,

01:06:31.260 --> 01:06:35.940
We don't accept votes until the end of the third song, when I say send votes.

01:06:35.940 --> 01:06:39.540
And the winner gets put into Orange Lounge Rotation for the whole week.

01:06:39.540 --> 01:06:42.780
And this song has been in for two weeks now, looking for its third week.

01:06:42.780 --> 01:06:44.660
This is the second time this has happened.

01:06:44.660 --> 01:06:45.320
All right.

01:06:45.320 --> 01:06:46.940
This is the first song you can vote for.

01:06:46.940 --> 01:06:49.980
The winner only gets a clip played of it, but we'll play a nice clip.

01:06:49.980 --> 01:06:50.500
Here we go.

01:06:50.500 --> 01:06:51.580
This is last week's winner.

01:06:51.580 --> 01:06:54.940
It's Vincent DeMoor with Eternity, the first song in tonight's Page Match.

01:06:54.940 --> 01:06:56.420
And now the winner.

01:06:56.420 --> 01:06:59.420
It's all an eternity

01:07:05.420 --> 01:07:07.420
Won't you join me?

01:07:07.420 --> 01:07:09.420
If it's right for you and me

01:07:09.420 --> 01:07:12.420
It's all in this place to be

01:07:16.420 --> 01:07:18.420
It's gonna be forever

01:07:18.420 --> 01:07:19.420
Not just for one day

01:07:19.420 --> 01:07:21.420
The feeling's gonna take you

01:07:21.420 --> 01:07:23.420
It takes you all the way

01:07:26.420 --> 01:07:28.420
It's gonna be forever

01:07:33.420 --> 01:07:35.420
Forever

01:07:40.420 --> 01:07:41.420
Forever

01:07:41.420 --> 01:07:58.420
Alright, that's song number one you can vote for, that's Vincent D'Amore with Eternity.

01:07:58.420 --> 01:08:03.700
Now I notice Loki's got something, he's trying very hard this week, he might do it to throw

01:08:03.700 --> 01:08:04.700
in Eternity.

01:08:04.700 --> 01:08:06.540
If any song's gonna do it, it's gonna be this one.

01:08:06.540 --> 01:08:10.340
I don't even know why I'm gonna bother tonight, but Loki, read it out.

01:08:10.340 --> 01:08:13.340
Alright, this one's a brand new track.

01:08:13.340 --> 01:08:16.340
Loki vs ZZ featuring Sun Decade.

01:08:16.340 --> 01:08:21.340
This is the debut of the finished version of The Legend of Trance.

01:08:21.340 --> 01:08:28.340
Here it is, the Legend of Trance Loki stage match pick tonight.

01:08:51.340 --> 01:08:52.340
H

01:08:52.340 --> 01:08:53.340
H

01:08:53.340 --> 01:08:54.340
H

01:08:54.340 --> 01:08:55.340
H

01:08:55.340 --> 01:08:56.340
H

01:08:56.340 --> 01:08:57.340
H

01:10:57.340 --> 01:11:18.980
Alright, that was Loki himself versus ZZ featuring Sun Decade with the Legend of Trance.

01:11:18.980 --> 01:11:25.980
what you guys think of it

01:11:29.980 --> 01:11:36.980
for the meeting

01:11:36.980 --> 01:12:05.980
Are we on? Yeah, we're on. Anyway. Yeah, you get 9. Alrighty, 0. Well, I actually had a chance to listen to it last night on the way the views are, and I definitely give it a 9. It was a great song. It was a pretty fun song. Loki, what'd you think? Dare I have? He gives himself a 69.

01:12:05.980 --> 01:12:12.980
I like it. You know, it can always be better, but yeah, 9.

01:12:12.980 --> 01:12:13.980
Alright.

01:12:13.980 --> 01:12:15.980
I'm buying a 10, because I can!

01:12:15.980 --> 01:12:16.980
Alright.

01:12:16.980 --> 01:12:21.980
He doesn't have a big ego now.

01:12:21.980 --> 01:12:24.980
It was very well done, I give it a 9.

01:12:24.980 --> 01:12:26.980
Ooh, 9's across the board so far.

01:12:26.980 --> 01:12:27.980
Brad?

01:12:27.980 --> 01:12:32.980
I think the earlier version of this gets a 9. This, he cleaned it up, this gets a 10.

01:12:32.980 --> 01:12:34.980
Oh, a 10 from Brad!

01:12:34.980 --> 01:12:39.940
wait wait wait for the legend of trance nevermind it was crap i get a zero

01:12:39.940 --> 01:12:41.340
all right um

01:12:41.340 --> 01:12:42.740
loki what can

01:12:42.740 --> 01:12:47.100
what can i say loki you're my i'm your biggest fanboy but i'm not going to

01:12:47.100 --> 01:12:50.860
inflate your ego by giving you a ten so you get a nine point nine

01:12:50.860 --> 01:12:54.820
uh... damn so he gets a nine point nine

01:12:54.820 --> 01:12:56.540
all right

01:12:56.540 --> 01:13:00.220
so there's your first two songs eternity from vincent amore and loki with the

01:13:00.220 --> 01:13:01.860
legend of trance

01:13:01.860 --> 01:13:05.720
I've decided since both of those two are very kick-ass songs there's no way in

01:13:05.720 --> 01:13:10.960
fucking hell I was gonna win with my original pick, so I'm going for broke!

01:13:10.960 --> 01:13:12.920
Forget this trance stuff!

01:13:12.920 --> 01:13:16.000
I'm just gonna play something that's fucking cool.

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:19.520
So my pick for tonight's cage match comes from a little movie you may or may not have

01:13:19.520 --> 01:13:20.440
heard of.

01:13:20.440 --> 01:13:24.000
It's a musical, because everybody loves musicals.

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:25.280
It's from a little

01:13:25.280 --> 01:13:27.480
little story about a boy

01:13:27.480 --> 01:13:30.920
who's a girl.

01:13:30.920 --> 01:13:35.920
and it's called Hedwig and the Angry Inch, so my pick for tonight's cage match

01:13:35.920 --> 01:13:39.920
is Angry Inch from the movie Hedwig and the Angry Inch, and you know what, this song

01:13:39.920 --> 01:13:44.920
really would make a kick-ass guitar freaks song, so, fuck you! Alright, enjoy!

01:13:44.920 --> 01:13:46.920
This is, uh, Hedwig and the Angry Inch with Angry Inch.

01:13:46.920 --> 01:14:12.680
My sex change operation got fucked, my guardian angel fell asleep on the watch, now all I

01:14:12.680 --> 01:14:14.680
All I got is a barbed-up front

01:14:14.680 --> 01:14:16.680
I got an angry itch

01:14:16.680 --> 01:14:20.680
Six inches forward, five inches back

01:14:20.680 --> 01:14:22.680
I got a, I got an angry itch

01:14:22.680 --> 01:14:26.680
Six inches forward, five inches back

01:14:26.680 --> 01:14:28.680
I got a, I got an angry itch

01:14:28.680 --> 01:14:33.680
I'm from the land where you still hear the cries

01:14:33.680 --> 01:14:36.680
I had to get out not to sever all ties

01:14:36.680 --> 01:14:39.680
I changed my name and assumed the disguise

01:15:09.680 --> 01:15:15.680
My mama made my tits out of clay My boyfriend told me that he'd take me away

01:15:15.680 --> 01:15:21.680
And he dragged me to the doctor one day I got an idea

01:15:21.680 --> 01:15:27.680
I said, this is fun, fine, this is bad I gotta go, I gotta find it

01:15:27.680 --> 01:15:33.680
I said, this is fun, fine, this is bad I gotta, I gotta find it

01:15:33.680 --> 01:15:35.680
Long story short

01:15:35.680 --> 01:15:42.680
Long story short, when I woke up from the operation, I was bleeding down there.

01:15:42.680 --> 01:15:46.680
I was bleeding from the gash between my legs.

01:15:46.680 --> 01:15:52.680
It was my first day as a woman, already that time of the month.

01:15:52.680 --> 01:15:56.680
Two days later the hole closed up, you know.

01:15:56.680 --> 01:16:02.680
The wound healed and I was left with a one inch mound of flesh.

01:16:02.680 --> 01:16:06.080
Oh, where my penis used to be, where my vagina never was

01:16:06.080 --> 01:16:09.080
It was a one-inch mound of flesh

01:16:09.080 --> 01:16:15.480
With the scar running down it like a sideways grimace on an eyelash face

01:16:15.480 --> 01:16:19.080
It was just a little buzz, they were letting it in

01:16:19.080 --> 01:16:22.680
Six inches falling, five inches back

01:16:22.680 --> 01:16:25.880
The pain is coming and I'm tired of the track

01:16:25.880 --> 01:16:28.280
I try to get over, don't take it no step

01:16:28.280 --> 01:16:56.400
We got a lot of dots from the chatroom.

01:16:56.400 --> 01:16:57.400
They are.

01:16:57.400 --> 01:17:00.400
Okay, how do we get the Angry Inch with Angry Inch?

01:17:00.400 --> 01:17:01.400
Jamie.

01:17:01.400 --> 01:17:02.400
Jamie gives it a ten.

01:17:02.400 --> 01:17:03.400
A big ten.

01:17:03.400 --> 01:17:04.400
Loki.

01:17:04.400 --> 01:17:05.400
It's zero.

01:17:05.400 --> 01:17:09.400
She just wants to give it a ten for her song once again.

01:17:09.400 --> 01:17:11.400
I don't know about that.

01:17:11.400 --> 01:17:14.400
I guess I'll give it like seven or something.

01:17:14.400 --> 01:17:17.400
It was funny as hell, but I don't know.

01:17:17.400 --> 01:17:21.400
I will see the movie one day and then I'll give it something higher maybe.

01:17:21.400 --> 01:17:22.400
Loki.

01:17:22.400 --> 01:17:26.400
I'd give it eight because it had colorful lyrics.

01:17:26.400 --> 01:17:33.400
uh...

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:37.200
and i did it and if that was a good time for you to play it every

01:17:37.200 --> 01:17:40.840
freaking game you know i would like to go to the house i would actually go to

01:17:40.840 --> 01:17:42.720
roosevelt off my hands and i thought

01:17:42.720 --> 01:17:46.760
the wind here

01:17:46.760 --> 01:17:47.840
here

01:17:47.840 --> 01:17:51.760
your penis and vagina in the middle of roosevelt off

01:17:51.760 --> 01:17:52.640
world

01:17:52.640 --> 01:17:57.140
I mean, when we're all there, I usually end up yelling penis and vagina anyway in conversation.

01:17:57.140 --> 01:17:58.140
Penis!

01:17:58.140 --> 01:17:59.140
Vagina!

01:17:59.140 --> 01:18:00.140
Penis!

01:18:00.140 --> 01:18:01.140
Vagina!

01:18:01.140 --> 01:18:02.140
Penis!

01:18:02.140 --> 01:18:03.140
Alright.

01:18:03.140 --> 01:18:04.140
Let's...

01:18:04.140 --> 01:18:09.240
You may start sending in your votes now to myself in the chat room, Skye, chat room slut.

01:18:09.240 --> 01:18:11.740
Or you can send those over email to orangeboxradio.yahoo.com.

01:18:11.740 --> 01:18:14.240
Let's review, shall we, really quickly.

01:18:14.240 --> 01:18:16.240
Choice number one, Eternity by Vincent de Mor.

01:18:16.240 --> 01:18:42.120
Choice number two, Loki with the Legend of Trance.

01:18:42.120 --> 01:18:45.480
Choice number three, Hedwig and the Angry Inch with Angry Inch.

01:18:45.480 --> 01:19:05.480
All right, there they are. Vote now. We'll tally those votes up during the next break.

01:19:05.480 --> 01:19:07.480
Yeah, this matches.

01:19:07.480 --> 01:19:13.480
Okay, wow, that was a fun cage match. We had an old favorite trance song, a new favorite

01:19:13.480 --> 01:19:27.680
I need to do my request of the week for any aspiring person who wants to make a mix of

01:19:27.680 --> 01:19:29.120
anything.

01:19:29.120 --> 01:19:31.760
I want the safari trance mix.

01:19:31.760 --> 01:19:33.040
You want a trance mix of the safari?

01:19:33.040 --> 01:19:34.760
Yes, my request is still out there.

01:19:34.760 --> 01:19:37.040
I played the safari today and I failed very badly.

01:19:37.040 --> 01:19:39.040
We need to play the safari during the break.

01:19:39.040 --> 01:19:41.520
Okay, we'll play the safari during the break.

01:19:41.520 --> 01:19:46.480
Remember for whoever makes this for me. I'm going to reward you in some form or fashion if it's cool, okay?

01:19:48.040 --> 01:19:49.920
Darkest who you was reminding me of something

01:19:49.920 --> 01:19:53.160
I need to play for y'all just to get what your thoughts are on this for y'all

01:19:53.160 --> 01:19:59.280
I thought I was the southern chick here. I'm just a southern bale in a boy's body

01:20:00.120 --> 01:20:02.600
Just kidding. I can get one of those trail made dresses

01:20:02.600 --> 01:20:07.600
This is um I'm being told that this is a clip from a new song in pop and music 9

01:20:07.600 --> 01:20:14.600
Tell me if this sounds a little familiar to you guys.

01:20:37.600 --> 01:20:44.600
Alright, that's the clip we got.

01:21:07.600 --> 01:21:17.600
I don't know the story behind that, where that came from. I guess I'm being told it's Popin' Music 9. I don't know enough about Popin' Music to know if that's true or not.

01:21:17.600 --> 01:21:21.600
Check the Japanese site for a music list.

01:21:21.600 --> 01:21:26.600
Well, from what I remember, the original URL that was posted was from Bomani's sale.

01:21:26.600 --> 01:21:28.600
Ah, alright.

01:21:28.600 --> 01:21:34.600
So, yeah. Guitar Freaks version. I don't know about Popin' Music. Sounds more Guitar Freaks to me, but whatever.

01:21:34.600 --> 01:21:37.400
Well, we have Dyke and Ty from, uh...

01:21:37.400 --> 01:21:38.400
True.

01:21:38.400 --> 01:21:39.400
I mean, this...

01:21:39.400 --> 01:21:40.400
Yeah.

01:21:40.400 --> 01:21:46.360
The freakin' Cutie Honey theme song in pop music.

01:21:46.360 --> 01:21:48.560
It's labeled as not as absolute as...

01:21:48.560 --> 01:21:50.200
It's labeled as Abotage.

01:21:50.200 --> 01:21:51.200
Okay.

01:21:51.200 --> 01:21:52.200
Whatever.

01:21:52.200 --> 01:21:58.480
That's what they had on there, they were talking about, like, if they were to make lyrics for

01:21:58.480 --> 01:22:03.840
it, like, we drink Rilin for a hot, hot limit, it was Icy Frozen Lightning Bolt.

01:22:03.840 --> 01:22:09.840
I have very few votes registered in right now for the cage match. I hope you all are voting.

01:22:09.840 --> 01:22:12.840
Send those in or we'll kill you.

01:22:12.840 --> 01:22:14.840
Vote or you get kicked.

01:22:14.840 --> 01:22:17.840
Vote or you get kicked from the chat room. Just kidding.

01:22:17.840 --> 01:22:19.840
We slap you with the trout.

01:22:19.840 --> 01:22:22.840
Alright, no, but seriously, you guys only have a few more minutes to send votes.

01:22:22.840 --> 01:22:24.840
Okay, I promise we will play this last break. We didn't get around to it.

01:22:24.840 --> 01:22:27.840
But this is a JB mix. We've heard something from Loki.

01:22:27.840 --> 01:22:32.840
One of our other regulars, JB, made a remix of, guess what, a Jenny Rom song.

01:22:32.840 --> 01:22:41.840
But you know what, JB did some good shit with that Sega thing, the Sega CD BIOS music, so I'm actually looking forward to hearing this. I think this will be very cool.

01:22:41.840 --> 01:22:47.840
This is a remix of Jenny Rom with Do You Wanna Flirt? It's called the Modern Dub Remix, and I'm looking forward to hearing it.

01:22:47.840 --> 01:22:50.840
And you should too, this remix by JB in our chatroom.

01:22:50.840 --> 01:22:52.840
Here we go, Orange Launch Radio.

01:24:50.840 --> 01:24:54.840
Uh, uh, uh Hvuh, hvuh, hvuh, hvuh

01:24:54.840 --> 01:24:58.840
Hvuh, hvuh, hvuh Hvuh, hvuh, hvuh

01:24:58.840 --> 01:25:02.840
Hvuh, hvuh, hvuh Hvuh, hvuh, hvuh

01:25:02.840 --> 01:25:06.840
Hvuh, hvuh, hvuh Hvuh, hvuh, hvuh

01:25:06.840 --> 01:25:10.840
Hvuh, hvuh, hvuh Hvuh, hvuh, hvuh

01:25:10.840 --> 01:25:14.840
Hvuh, hvuh, hvuh

01:25:14.840 --> 01:25:18.840
Hvuh, hvuh, hvuh

01:26:18.840 --> 01:26:48.720
Alright, my

01:26:48.720 --> 01:26:54.980
My apologies to JB because that's the modem dub mix, not the modern dub mix.

01:26:54.980 --> 01:26:55.980
My bad.

01:26:55.980 --> 01:26:56.980
Jesus.

01:26:56.980 --> 01:26:57.980
So that's the modem dub mix.

01:26:57.980 --> 01:26:58.980
Nice job, nice job.

01:26:58.980 --> 01:26:59.980
All right, back to break.

01:29:29.980 --> 01:29:31.980
I feel the light

01:29:51.980 --> 01:29:54.980
I feel the light of the night

01:29:54.980 --> 01:29:58.980
I feel the light of the time

01:30:28.980 --> 01:30:58.660
Let's listen in on an Orange Lounge radio staff meeting.

01:30:58.660 --> 01:31:05.660
Bevani Radio. That's us. Orange Lounge Radio.

01:31:07.180 --> 01:31:12.060
Sounds like Rejected.

01:31:12.060 --> 01:31:14.960
Best movie ever.

01:31:14.960 --> 01:31:18.740
Peewee's Big Adventure, when he gets kidnapped by the bikers.

01:31:18.740 --> 01:31:22.420
Did you know that that's Elvira? The female one that grabs him by the

01:31:22.420 --> 01:31:23.260
neck and goes,

01:31:23.260 --> 01:31:28.160
I see. I don't remember what she said. That's Elvira, the chick.

01:31:28.160 --> 01:31:29.560
Well, next time, pay attention!

01:31:29.560 --> 01:31:34.200
If you saw Spider-Man, the punk girl that they interview, is Lucy Lawless.

01:31:34.200 --> 01:31:36.560
Yep, Lucy Lawless is in there.

01:31:36.560 --> 01:31:38.040
Right on.

01:31:38.040 --> 01:31:40.040
Okay, yay!

01:31:40.040 --> 01:31:44.200
Wow, that's sad when I do a better Xena impression than Jamie. Ow, I got kicked!

01:31:44.200 --> 01:31:46.240
Okay.

01:31:46.240 --> 01:31:48.520
By the way, I have to...

01:31:48.520 --> 01:31:50.240
Yes?

01:31:50.240 --> 01:31:54.860
What are you doing? Who's the victim? Are you going to randomly kick somebody from the chat room? Who's the victim?

01:31:54.860 --> 01:31:59.580
Oh, or you slap somebody with a trout? Yes.

01:31:59.580 --> 01:32:00.420
Oh, I see.

01:32:00.420 --> 01:32:05.460
Well, you made me slap somebody. Ha ha!

01:32:05.460 --> 01:32:08.320
Now the whole chat room is joining in great.

01:32:08.320 --> 01:32:10.160
I start trends.

01:32:10.160 --> 01:32:12.460
You're such a trendsetter.

01:32:12.460 --> 01:32:16.120
Let's see, oh yes, the cage match.

01:32:16.120 --> 01:32:19.840
The winner of the cage match tonight

01:32:19.840 --> 01:32:24.960
absolutely no contest whatsoever whatsoever

01:32:24.960 --> 01:32:27.960
why don't you announce it, Jamie?

01:32:27.960 --> 01:32:30.040
angry inch is the winner

01:32:30.040 --> 01:32:32.920
no, angry inch was not the winner, but close

01:32:32.920 --> 01:32:38.880
way closer than i would have guessed

01:32:38.880 --> 01:32:41.160
as is most of the chat room, because it didn't win

01:32:41.160 --> 01:32:45.920
LOKI WINS

01:32:45.920 --> 01:32:49.920
I would have put that in rotation even if it didn't win, shit.

01:32:49.920 --> 01:32:52.920
Do it, see if I care.

01:32:52.920 --> 01:32:56.920
No, the winner's the Great Space Coaster.

01:32:56.920 --> 01:33:00.920
Alright, so Legend of Trance wins this week's cage match, and will probably win for the next four weeks.

01:33:00.920 --> 01:33:03.920
We need someone to do Legend of Cumshot next.

01:33:03.920 --> 01:33:05.920
Yeah, we need somebody to make one of those erotic...

01:33:05.920 --> 01:33:07.920
Well, uh...

01:33:07.920 --> 01:33:10.920
Get some porn noises.

01:33:10.920 --> 01:33:13.920
I got porn, I can rip audio from that in some pores.

01:33:13.920 --> 01:33:18.920
I got some gay porn in the other room, lots of cum shots in gay porn.

01:33:18.920 --> 01:33:20.920
Jamie's all, you do?

01:33:20.920 --> 01:33:24.920
Just kidding, I only have one. Irene bought it for me for my birthday.

01:33:24.920 --> 01:33:33.920
I can just see it now, instead of like, the fly, you know, and the birth, it's like, ooh.

01:33:33.920 --> 01:33:38.920
You know what, they've been wanting a Sky's voice remix, so I can do my voice and I can go,

01:33:38.920 --> 01:33:41.920
It flies!

01:33:41.920 --> 01:33:44.920
The stickiest!

01:33:47.920 --> 01:33:50.920
Cream of some young guy.

01:33:50.920 --> 01:33:53.920
Okay, we'll work on that. We'll work on Legend of Cupshot for you guys.

01:33:53.920 --> 01:33:56.920
And then when it's all fear, it's like,

01:33:56.920 --> 01:33:59.920
Ugh! Queer!

01:33:59.920 --> 01:34:02.920
Queer!

01:34:02.920 --> 01:34:05.920
Okay, we'll work on that.

01:34:05.920 --> 01:34:08.460
be a present for our loyal listeners?

01:34:08.460 --> 01:34:12.000
I almost memorized the whole lyrics for a superstar.

01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:13.060
Why?

01:34:13.060 --> 01:34:16.920
Because I was going to do a rap and went, okay, this really sucked. I was going to do

01:34:16.920 --> 01:34:21.560
a rap, okay, and they wanted, they had this thing for my work, it's a promo thing because

01:34:21.560 --> 01:34:27.800
we're promoting 8 Mile, and they were doing this, like, rap-off thing, and it was so you

01:34:27.800 --> 01:34:28.800
could win $100.

01:34:28.800 --> 01:34:31.380
I think you actually told us this story two weeks ago, but that's okay, tell us again.

01:34:31.380 --> 01:34:36.480
So I was going to do that, and so I memorized, you know, most, I got Superstar, but I ended

01:34:36.480 --> 01:34:40.580
up not doing it, and a lot of our company people did it, but they made their own wraps

01:34:40.580 --> 01:34:47.060
for, um, like, our work stuff, whatever. But this one guy did it off, off, um, just out

01:34:47.060 --> 01:34:51.200
of the blue. He just, you know, came up with it right on the spot. That was kind of cool.

01:34:51.200 --> 01:34:55.880
But instead of, you know, having the contest be, you know, where you could win $100, everyone

01:34:55.880 --> 01:34:57.880
I did it and got $100.

01:34:57.880 --> 01:34:58.880
Oh.

01:34:58.880 --> 01:34:59.880
But not me because I didn't do it.

01:34:59.880 --> 01:35:00.880
Don't!

01:35:00.880 --> 01:35:01.880
Oh well.

01:35:01.880 --> 01:35:02.880
That sucks.

01:35:02.880 --> 01:35:06.880
Uh, what else am I going to talk about?

01:35:06.880 --> 01:35:10.880
I had something that I wanted to ask or talk about and I totally forgot.

01:35:10.880 --> 01:35:11.880
It slipped my mind.

01:35:11.880 --> 01:35:12.880
Damn!

01:35:12.880 --> 01:35:13.880
Hate that!

01:35:13.880 --> 01:35:14.880
Bad radio!

01:35:14.880 --> 01:35:15.880
Damn!

01:35:15.880 --> 01:35:16.880
I need to write this shit down!

01:35:16.880 --> 01:35:17.880
That's too much work though.

01:35:17.880 --> 01:35:19.880
That's more effort than I desire to put into this show.

01:35:19.880 --> 01:35:20.880
Uh...

01:35:20.880 --> 01:35:21.880
As Jamie Files fails.

01:35:21.880 --> 01:35:25.320
uh...

01:35:25.320 --> 01:35:29.040
you that he's yeah why don't we just get to the f he's the week went on

01:35:29.040 --> 01:35:30.380
as i said the jimmy

01:35:30.380 --> 01:35:32.000
jimmy's nodding

01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:34.060
she's got to make secrets you want to say

01:35:34.060 --> 01:35:36.400
you know we've been getting advice for some people because they have to use

01:35:36.400 --> 01:35:39.260
always seem to go on for a long time that we ought to cut back

01:35:39.260 --> 01:35:41.240
the f he's a week's like once a month or something

01:35:41.240 --> 01:35:44.480
well then it would be at least the week now with a look at how long would you

01:35:44.480 --> 01:35:47.900
think that would be yeah if there would be a whole month's worth of it we have

01:35:47.900 --> 01:35:49.240
to do a whole show

01:35:49.240 --> 01:35:52.120
We'd have to have, okay, last Sunday of each month is the FU show.

01:35:52.120 --> 01:35:58.200
I promise to cut back on the repeat FUs, like for drivers and stuff, because we know that

01:35:58.200 --> 01:36:01.960
they suck all year round and there's nothing going to change.

01:36:01.960 --> 01:36:09.060
So you know, maybe we'd have to just instate quotas on the chatroom FUs.

01:36:09.060 --> 01:36:12.200
So we'll punish you people that bitch.

01:36:12.200 --> 01:36:13.200
That's right.

01:36:13.200 --> 01:36:14.520
Yeah, you don't get any.

01:36:14.520 --> 01:36:19.080
Come on the show and you get to be as much as you want.

01:36:19.080 --> 01:36:22.120
though I have but for tonight now we're just he's we're giving you guys a hard

01:36:22.120 --> 01:36:22.880

01:36:22.880 --> 01:36:25.640
will do the F use like we always do so

01:36:25.640 --> 01:36:29.880
sentences that used to be it uh... i'm sky mistel chat room slide i think i am

01:36:29.880 --> 01:36:32.960

01:36:32.960 --> 01:36:36.920
uh... jamie terror original

01:36:36.920 --> 01:36:38.840
cuz you're terrifying

01:36:38.840 --> 01:36:41.120
that's let's start

01:36:41.120 --> 01:36:48.120
here we go if he's the week you know you love it

01:36:50.600 --> 01:36:51.600
this is all

01:36:51.600 --> 01:36:56.600
all

01:36:56.600 --> 01:37:03.600
uh...

01:37:03.600 --> 01:37:11.600
Yeah, bad drivers. Especially old people drivers, who tailgate. I hate them. Anyway.

01:37:11.600 --> 01:37:23.600
The next one goes to Sacre Mani, to our server, that always goes down. So we're moving. Eventually.

01:37:23.600 --> 01:37:26.600
Yes. We possibly can.

01:37:26.600 --> 01:37:32.600
So, OneDollarHosings.com gets a big finger up here. They're actually good enough.

01:37:32.600 --> 01:37:34.600
Them and their stupid pirates are...

01:37:34.600 --> 01:37:36.600
Yeah, ark.

01:37:36.600 --> 01:37:38.600
Um, another one.

01:37:38.600 --> 01:37:40.600
I've been missing Buffy for two weeks,

01:37:40.600 --> 01:37:42.600
but you saved me for me, right?

01:37:42.600 --> 01:37:44.600
I did. I hope, hopefully, my roommate loses.

01:37:44.600 --> 01:37:46.600
Yay, back at you.

01:37:46.600 --> 01:37:48.600
Um, another one goes toward me

01:37:48.600 --> 01:37:50.600
for ignoring my Animal Crossing village

01:37:50.600 --> 01:37:52.600
and my village's new economy,

01:37:52.600 --> 01:37:54.600
but they still have me.

01:37:54.600 --> 01:37:56.600
Um, happy if he does the video,

01:37:56.600 --> 01:37:58.600
he'll be back.

01:37:58.600 --> 01:38:00.600
And another one goes toward your village

01:38:00.600 --> 01:38:03.600
Another one goes for your ability to get all the rare people.

01:38:03.600 --> 01:38:05.600
I got camo prod.

01:38:05.600 --> 01:38:07.600
Black cube, cute trick.

01:38:07.600 --> 01:38:09.600
Cute trick?

01:38:09.600 --> 01:38:11.600
Cute to penguin.

01:38:11.600 --> 01:38:12.600
What's cute?

01:38:12.600 --> 01:38:13.600
Penguin!

01:38:13.600 --> 01:38:16.600
An Animal Crossing. We're still talking Animal Crossing.

01:38:18.600 --> 01:38:21.600
I had another one. Oh yeah, another one goes for last night.

01:38:21.600 --> 01:38:25.600
For me being really sick and out of it and not eating anything.

01:38:25.600 --> 01:38:34.600
Another one goes toward just about every store in this town except for this one Ghetto Mart in Trader Joe's for not having Orangina.

01:38:34.600 --> 01:38:39.600
Another one goes toward Oatmeal Creme Pies for being an evicted food item.

01:38:39.600 --> 01:38:43.600
And then one goes toward Walgreens for not having Peach Coppellas.

01:38:43.600 --> 01:38:47.600
But however, they did have Coppell by a week ago.

01:38:47.600 --> 01:38:53.600
Another one goes toward a lot of stores in town for not selling balls, because I like blue balls.

01:38:53.600 --> 01:39:00.600
And, um, another one is going toward, um, my socks for things to do.

01:39:00.600 --> 01:39:04.600
See, I've got stuff in my shoe and they're really tight for a drive.

01:39:04.600 --> 01:39:08.600
And my big F.U. of the Week goes toward jaylist.com.

01:39:08.600 --> 01:39:11.600
I put in my order a month ago.

01:39:11.600 --> 01:39:15.600
For loose socks and bakari sweats and soft glue.

01:39:15.600 --> 01:39:18.600
Do you know what? It's still not in my house yet.

01:39:18.600 --> 01:39:37.600
I bought Mega Ranger vs. Power Rangers, and Mega Ranger vs. Bingo Ranger, and that's it.

01:39:48.600 --> 01:39:55.600
special music this goes for with my F.U.'s.

01:39:56.960 --> 01:39:59.600
Most of these F.U.'s come from last night.

01:39:59.600 --> 01:40:02.280
F.U. to Vacaville, because you suck!

01:40:02.280 --> 01:40:09.280
F.U. the white trash that lives in Vacaville. I really hate you, and I don't like you coming up and talking to me.

01:40:11.360 --> 01:40:15.960
One person in particular is a stupid cowboy skater.

01:40:15.960 --> 01:40:18.960
You can't mix those two genres together. It's like oil and water.

01:40:18.960 --> 01:40:22.960
Okay, but this jackass comes up to us, starts talking to us, puts his hand...

01:40:22.960 --> 01:40:26.960
Okay, now obviously this is gonna be bad radio, but he goes up to the table and goes...

01:40:26.960 --> 01:40:28.960
Hits the table and he's like,

01:40:28.960 --> 01:40:29.960
How you doin'?

01:40:29.960 --> 01:40:30.960
And I'm like,

01:40:30.960 --> 01:40:31.960
Go away!

01:40:32.960 --> 01:40:36.960
And then he kept staying there and talking to us and got into a conversation with us.

01:40:36.960 --> 01:40:39.960
Eventually we ended up bringing up the DDR solo thing.

01:40:39.960 --> 01:40:40.960
He's like,

01:40:40.960 --> 01:40:42.960
Uh, what's a syringe?

01:40:42.960 --> 01:40:47.960
Maybe if you weren't such a dumbass, you'd know what that is.

01:40:47.960 --> 01:40:48.960
Then...

01:40:48.960 --> 01:40:49.960
Oh yeah.

01:40:49.960 --> 01:40:50.960
Oh, what about Ecstasy?

01:40:50.960 --> 01:40:51.960
Like, what led into the whole solo syringe thing, someone was playing a song, Ecstasy,

01:40:51.960 --> 01:40:52.960
and he goes, what's up with the movie?

01:40:52.960 --> 01:40:53.960
It's like, the wall, it says breakdown, but the wall's not breakdown.

01:40:53.960 --> 01:40:54.960
Why don't they just put a big flow on there?

01:40:54.960 --> 01:40:55.960
You know, through the pro Ecstasy?

01:40:55.960 --> 01:40:56.960
They're just so retarded the way you said it.

01:40:56.960 --> 01:40:57.960
It's not like that.

01:40:57.960 --> 01:41:00.960
someone was playing a song, Ecstasy, and he goes,

01:41:00.960 --> 01:41:01.960
what's up with the movie?

01:41:01.960 --> 01:41:03.960
It's like, the wall, it says breakdown of the wall,

01:41:03.960 --> 01:41:04.960
not breakdown.

01:41:04.960 --> 01:41:05.960
Why don't they just put a great flow on there?

01:41:05.960 --> 01:41:07.960
You know, through the pro Ecstasy?

01:41:07.960 --> 01:41:09.960
He was just really tired of the way he said it.

01:41:09.960 --> 01:41:11.960
That's how it happens.

01:41:11.960 --> 01:41:14.960
Then, he tried to hug Brian.

01:41:14.960 --> 01:41:16.960
Aww.

01:41:16.960 --> 01:41:19.960
He just wants a hug.

01:41:19.960 --> 01:41:21.960
He was trying to hug on everybody.

01:41:21.960 --> 01:41:22.960
And he just had this problem.

01:41:22.960 --> 01:41:24.960
He said this one kid was his lover.

01:41:24.960 --> 01:41:26.960
He was like, 12-year-old kid.

01:41:26.960 --> 01:41:28.960
You got a problem with that?

01:41:28.960 --> 01:41:32.960
He was like 17 or 18, the kid was 12. It's like Michael Jackson.

01:41:34.960 --> 01:41:37.960
First of all, now you know the reason why I love this song.

01:41:37.960 --> 01:41:45.960
Alright, and, finally, uh, FU2, their machine conditions at that arcade, they suck ass.

01:41:45.960 --> 01:41:51.960
DVR the fifth mix fucking all the arrows are broken and max 2 the arrows are set in about

01:41:52.520 --> 01:41:55.200
1 quarter inch into the pad so it's like

01:41:55.840 --> 01:41:57.840
You can't play on that it sucks

01:41:58.360 --> 01:42:05.300
So that's like their fucking soda machine is broken. Okay, you I wanted to fucking see your miss and I get a Mountain Dew

01:42:05.840 --> 01:42:07.840
What the hell?

01:42:10.480 --> 01:42:13.200
Then then to add that on top

01:42:13.200 --> 01:42:16.200
For all that, then we get to Qsar.

01:42:16.200 --> 01:42:17.200
Oh yeah.

01:42:17.200 --> 01:42:21.200
Okay, there's, the way they have that working out there, it totally sucks.

01:42:21.200 --> 01:42:23.200
They, the employees don't know what the fuck they're doing.

01:42:23.200 --> 01:42:25.200
The employees aren't really working, they just put people there.

01:42:25.200 --> 01:42:27.200
Their briefing room's an empty room.

01:42:27.200 --> 01:42:28.200
They don't have half pay passes.

01:42:28.200 --> 01:42:33.200
It's just it, it's an empty room, not painted, empty room.

01:42:33.200 --> 01:42:35.200
They don't have half pay passes.

01:42:35.200 --> 01:42:37.200
They don't have half pay passes, they fucking suck.

01:42:37.200 --> 01:42:41.200
So, yeah, FV to them, um...

01:42:41.200 --> 01:42:53.200
That's legit. That's all I had. You know, I really was trying to come up with a huge list. I had a bunch of stuff last night, but after a while at Qsar, we had some people come talk to us. They're really nice, and they made me less angsty, so that was cool.

01:42:53.200 --> 01:42:56.200
Yeah, I think, right. You're a little bit like that guy.

01:42:56.200 --> 01:42:58.200
Yeah, he was attacked.

01:42:58.200 --> 01:43:04.200
That's it. I'm not too angsty at the moment. There could be anything close to me later on.

01:43:04.200 --> 01:43:06.200
That's it.

01:43:06.200 --> 01:43:12.200
My turn. I changed my song last week, it goes over paying attention.

01:43:12.200 --> 01:43:26.200
My FU for this week goes to Drama, because I've seen too much of it this week, and it needs to go away.

01:43:26.200 --> 01:43:32.200
One more FU and I'll give him some music.

01:43:32.200 --> 01:43:38.200
Well, this is kind of funny. Let's just say I'm going to give an FU to Twen just because he thinks he's funny.

01:43:38.200 --> 01:43:48.200
Twen thinks he's all cool because he went and changed the redirect on my site to some stupid toughgirl.com picture or whatever.

01:43:48.200 --> 01:43:53.200
Some stupid chick shooting shit out of her ass and into her mouth, which is all photoshopped anyway.

01:43:53.200 --> 01:43:56.400
Yeah, yeah, it's all photoshopped. But anyways, it's not the-

01:43:56.400 --> 01:43:58.400
HAHA, LOOK WHAT I FOUND ON THE INTERNET!

01:43:58.400 --> 01:44:04.600
The whole point is, I don't care, because I don't use that site anymore, you jackass.

01:44:04.600 --> 01:44:08.500
What you do is, it's definitely like someone messing up my GeoCD's webpage.

01:44:08.500 --> 01:44:13.400
I don't give a fuck. I thought it was funny, I laughed, and I laughed at you for trying to be funny.

01:44:13.400 --> 01:44:17.000
Or just attempting to insult me in any way, guess what?

01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:19.700
You ain't still getting those fucking CDs, and you're a loser.

01:44:19.700 --> 01:44:26.700
So, oh, there'll probably be a little special gift for you later on on the web websites, but uh, that'll be later on, so.

01:44:26.700 --> 01:44:29.700
This is a very funny video, it means I don't know all of it.

01:44:29.700 --> 01:44:32.700
I know, it's hilarious, I totally, you know.

01:44:32.700 --> 01:44:36.700
Did you see that bullshit in his live journal, by the way, his username is 2316?

01:44:36.700 --> 01:44:37.700
No.

01:44:37.700 --> 01:44:40.700
A live journal? Go read that, that's fucking hilarious.

01:44:40.700 --> 01:44:42.700
He's just stupid, and he thought that...

01:44:42.700 --> 01:44:45.700
I'm sorry, that was, I was just literally reading that going,

01:44:45.700 --> 01:44:51.060
like oh my god how do you like be pathetic because one person can't even read i mean he truly has no life

01:44:51.060 --> 01:44:58.820
you put rape from loki ah you're funny man i mean i want to know how and normally i don't talk shit

01:44:58.820 --> 01:45:03.380
about people but he really deserves to be talking shit about you he's so stupid and you know me do i

01:45:03.380 --> 01:45:10.660
talk shit about him no never i'm talking shit about him okay first and foremost first and foremost

01:45:10.660 --> 01:45:19.660
Anyone who feels the need, they have to do impersonations to try to coerce somebody into saying something that they end up not saying anyway.

01:45:19.660 --> 01:45:25.660
I'm sorry, that's so stupid. I can do a better job than that, okay?

01:45:25.660 --> 01:45:30.660
If you're gonna fuck up my sight, at least put some effort into it. That was stupid. My god, shit, how long does it take to fucking put a-

01:45:30.660 --> 01:45:37.660
You know what you wanna see more disturbing? You gotta think about your friend to say, if you knew where to find that fish tank, oh my god.

01:45:37.660 --> 01:45:44.660
I don't think it's even more pathetic to be, to be so hated, not even in video games.

01:45:44.660 --> 01:45:51.660
play as much effort than that as your fucking remixes. I mean, shit man, you need to like...

01:45:51.920 --> 01:45:55.040
How about this? I'll tell you what. Why don't you go get banned from a couple more chat

01:45:55.040 --> 01:45:58.840
rooms, and then you know, come talk to me. Oh wait, you can't because I banned your fucking

01:45:58.840 --> 01:46:05.840
address. Oh darn. Don't give a fuck. I don't think it's more pathetic to be so hated, not

01:46:05.880 --> 01:46:12.640
even in media. I don't understand why people don't like me! I'm likable! I'm a likable

01:46:12.640 --> 01:46:16.240
person i should have called the prison the society's messed up

01:46:16.240 --> 01:46:21.120
to suck so badly that you can't even suck in a person

01:46:21.120 --> 01:46:24.560
that takes a truly defensive approach

01:46:24.560 --> 01:46:29.040
sorry for taking up your questions i'm sorry that's better

01:46:29.040 --> 01:46:33.600
all i have to say is you ain't bad you ain't bad i'm rolling games i'm rolling

01:46:33.600 --> 01:46:39.440
games i'll go to school not kill people and and now i have to say this

01:46:39.440 --> 01:46:45.440
Because I think we've gotten it out of our system, and he has to laugh every time we know his stupid bullshit comes up.

01:46:45.440 --> 01:46:48.440
He's not even worth talking about.

01:46:48.440 --> 01:46:52.440
He's a waste of breath, and should be put in chocolate or something.

01:46:52.440 --> 01:46:57.440
So, why don't we just say, twin mill on greatness?

01:46:57.440 --> 01:46:59.440
Alright, fair enough.

01:46:59.440 --> 01:47:00.440
Agreed.

01:47:00.440 --> 01:47:01.440
Agreed.

01:47:01.440 --> 01:47:03.440
Can I do my FUs now?

01:47:03.440 --> 01:47:04.440
What?

01:47:04.440 --> 01:47:06.440
My FU? Oh!

01:47:06.440 --> 01:47:11.000
what i think they had to go to drama

01:47:11.000 --> 01:47:13.880
all right

01:47:13.880 --> 01:47:16.280
other if you go to uh...

01:47:16.280 --> 01:47:19.280
superficial

01:47:19.280 --> 01:47:22.760
don't call you

01:47:22.760 --> 01:47:27.440
i think that's it but you

01:47:27.440 --> 01:47:30.000
that's why

01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:31.280
and i've had enough

01:47:31.280 --> 01:47:32.640
uh... let's go to zero

01:47:32.640 --> 01:47:34.640
Let's hear if he has any FUs of the Week.

01:48:02.640 --> 01:48:09.160
you would have them oh in the fact they

01:48:15.680 --> 01:48:20.800
it's like ratty-ass world industries skateboard

01:48:20.800 --> 01:48:46.920
I feel that I'm justified in saying so.

01:48:46.920 --> 01:48:53.920
All I have to say to that guy is, you ain't bad, I run with gangs, I'm run with gangs,

01:48:55.320 --> 01:48:58.320
I go to school and I kill people, I digitally remove job in the hub in Star Wars.

01:48:58.320 --> 01:49:03.320
You know what's really sad about that arcade? You can tell where they have their priorities.

01:49:03.320 --> 01:49:09.320
Um, they have, you know, their DDR machines and, no, they have their DDR machines in really

01:49:09.320 --> 01:49:14.320
shitty conditions, but wait, what's this in the corner? E.T. Wheeler in the giant, it's

01:49:14.320 --> 01:49:17.820
It's like an actual-sized cab of an 18-wheeler truck.

01:49:17.820 --> 01:49:19.820
Dude, that game's cool, though.

01:49:19.820 --> 01:49:21.820
No? Why would you race 18...

01:49:21.820 --> 01:49:24.320
That's like racing dump trucks.

01:49:24.320 --> 01:49:26.320
Or racing...

01:49:26.320 --> 01:49:27.820
Awful.

01:49:27.820 --> 01:49:29.820
Yeah, it was pretty bad.

01:49:29.820 --> 01:49:35.320
I played that once at, um, whatever Riptide Arcade was before it was Riptide Arcade at Pier 39.

01:49:35.320 --> 01:49:37.320
I played that once.

01:49:38.320 --> 01:49:43.820
Another thing, don't exactly plan on drinking from the drinking fountains.

01:49:43.820 --> 01:49:48.820
You go over there and there's like hamburger and cigarette butts smashed in the drain.

01:49:48.820 --> 01:49:50.820
Burger butts?

01:49:50.820 --> 01:49:55.820
Alright, hamburger and cigarette butts jammed in the drain.

01:49:55.820 --> 01:50:00.820
And what made it even more fun is they had the backwoods stacked backwards.

01:50:00.820 --> 01:50:05.820
Did you ever see that episode of Married with Children when Al was barbecuing hamburgers and using cigarette butts?

01:50:05.820 --> 01:50:06.820
Yeah.

01:50:06.820 --> 01:50:09.820
And then somehow the dead mother got mixed in, I don't know anyway.

01:50:09.820 --> 01:50:13.820
Yeah, married with children is the shit, by the way.

01:50:13.820 --> 01:50:15.820
Were those dreams about words?

01:50:15.820 --> 01:50:17.820
You'd be afraid to go your own way.

01:50:17.820 --> 01:50:21.820
You'd be afraid to get in a game race or something.

01:50:21.820 --> 01:50:23.820
You'd have to go step back there.

01:50:23.820 --> 01:50:25.820
It would be even better.

01:50:25.820 --> 01:50:27.820
They had no other sense of bathrooms.

01:50:27.820 --> 01:50:31.820
But in front of the doors were arcade games blocking the doors.

01:50:31.820 --> 01:50:36.820
It's like you got to go to the bathroom and get through there.

01:50:36.820 --> 01:50:42.820
Hey, I have an idea. Why don't we post it to the health boards and have it sit down?

01:50:42.820 --> 01:50:46.820
It's basically like TCL because they have a nice diagonal side of it.

01:50:46.820 --> 01:50:48.820
Well, TCL actually is pretty...

01:50:48.820 --> 01:50:49.820
Is it?

01:50:49.820 --> 01:50:51.820
This thing that they're talking about.

01:50:51.820 --> 01:50:53.820
I feel like that's helpful.

01:50:53.820 --> 01:50:57.820
The pages might come, but the places actually tend to be TCL.

01:50:57.820 --> 01:50:59.820
But I think...

01:50:59.820 --> 01:51:01.820
Dude, last night's Starrcade...

01:51:01.820 --> 01:51:03.820
Yeah, if it's like that, they'll call the health boards, seriously.

01:51:03.820 --> 01:51:07.820
From zero to ghetto in like an hour or so.

01:51:07.820 --> 01:51:10.820
This is for Irene, even though she's not listening.

01:51:10.820 --> 01:51:15.820
Um, hello police? Yeah, um, I'm in a wheelchair, and...

01:51:15.820 --> 01:51:17.820
Oh, actually, Loki gets better than me.

01:51:17.820 --> 01:51:20.820
Oh, I'll tell you guys later. I'll take you guys off the show.

01:51:20.820 --> 01:51:23.820
The highlight of the night was driving there and driving home.

01:51:23.820 --> 01:51:25.820
Pretty fun.

01:51:25.820 --> 01:51:28.820
I mean, the actual arena accused I was cool,

01:51:28.820 --> 01:51:30.820
and that was about the only time you had fun,

01:51:30.820 --> 01:51:36.400
Was when you're playing the game except me I'd wait for an hour for us to get our first game and then like 45 minutes

01:51:36.400 --> 01:51:38.800
For the second one when they were standing around doing nothing

01:51:39.500 --> 01:51:41.500
You seem to have that good trip to positive

01:51:42.500 --> 01:51:46.020
Five teams or just go back to back back bills fine

01:51:46.140 --> 01:51:53.020
It's just they have really bad organization once you if you're there and demand to go into the game. That's pretty you'll go

01:51:53.020 --> 01:52:04.020
And you get the one guy who, you give them their tickets, like, their first true name.

01:52:04.020 --> 01:52:06.020
There's all the members in the team.

01:52:06.020 --> 01:52:08.020
It's like, I'll remember you.

01:52:08.020 --> 01:52:15.020
And then you come back and you're like, man, this is crazy.

01:52:15.020 --> 01:52:17.020
Okay, this is way more important than Vacaville.

01:52:17.020 --> 01:52:19.020
I got corrected by Vidkawa.

01:52:19.020 --> 01:52:31.520
He said, actually Peggy spilled Al's barbecue charcoal and then she told Kelly and Bud to go find some ashes for her and Kelly goes and steals Darcy's dead mother's ashes and gives it to Peggy and then Al cooks the burgers with the dead Darcy ashes.

01:52:31.520 --> 01:52:34.520
That's right, because the ashes make the burger taste good.

01:52:34.520 --> 01:52:40.520
But I could've sworn there were cigarettes without ashes as part of the joke. Maybe that was another show. I'm getting my wires crossed.

01:52:40.520 --> 01:52:43.520
Sorry to interrupt, but you know, married to children's shit and all.

01:52:43.520 --> 01:52:48.520
I don't know if I think there's an answer, but after they hear that, you're gonna have to kind of reach through the gap, do you like that?

01:53:13.520 --> 01:53:22.520
I got my license like a week ago or something, and I'm happy about that, but no I don't have my car, I'm driving my brother's car. Right now I'm going home, anyway.

01:53:22.520 --> 01:53:36.520
And fuck the DMV for being the biggest piece of shit ever. Oh my god. It's like you get outside and go to in line. The line is like a rollercoaster line.

01:53:36.520 --> 01:53:41.520
It goes, curves around four times, and then goes outside the door, and then...

01:53:41.520 --> 01:53:47.520
So we wait in line for about an hour and a half, and we're late for our, you know, service or something.

01:53:47.520 --> 01:53:48.520
Then we get there.

01:53:48.520 --> 01:53:50.520
Oh, you're waiting in the wrong line.

01:53:50.520 --> 01:53:53.520
Go wait in that line. And there's two people in that line.

01:53:53.520 --> 01:53:56.520
And there's only two people in that line.

01:53:56.520 --> 01:53:59.520
And so then it's like, shit, I could be out of here by now.

01:53:59.520 --> 01:54:03.520
So then after we go there, and I get my appointment on that bit,

01:54:03.520 --> 01:54:19.520
Then I have to go wait another line, drive your car off, power off, wait 15 minutes, move one spot, wait 20 minutes, and then after about 2 hours I finally finish, and so the DMV fucking kicks me off.

01:54:19.520 --> 01:54:25.520
FUCK YOU DMV! I'M ANSTY!

01:54:25.520 --> 01:54:31.520
Sorry, I went to the one in the front.

01:54:31.520 --> 01:54:58.040
Anyway, back to my FUs, another FU relating to driving is fuck old people for their shitty

01:54:58.040 --> 01:55:03.040
ass driving. Old people can't drive. Old people are crap.

01:55:03.040 --> 01:55:06.040
This is so cute because he's just now learning this, getting to drive.

01:55:06.040 --> 01:55:10.040
Like, I knew that old people drove slow. Welcome to the driving course.

01:55:10.040 --> 01:55:14.040
I knew that old people drove slow. But I didn't know that old people were this stupid.

01:55:14.040 --> 01:55:18.040
Like, they drive, and they see a red light maybe 100 meters up.

01:55:18.040 --> 01:55:23.040
They start slowing down, and they're going 30 at the time in a 45 zone,

01:55:23.040 --> 01:55:26.040
and they start slowing down to about 5 miles an hour.

01:55:26.040 --> 01:55:30.480
The light's still red, they've got about 50 meters to go until they hit the red light

01:55:30.480 --> 01:55:33.360
and they're going at, you know, five miles an hour.

01:55:33.360 --> 01:55:37.380
And then the light turns green, they pull to a complete stop, and then they go, like

01:55:37.380 --> 01:55:38.380
it's a stop sign.

01:55:38.380 --> 01:55:41.380
And then when they stop behind you, they have their, like, kind of, like, ground.

01:55:41.380 --> 01:55:42.380
Yes.

01:55:42.380 --> 01:55:46.380
I was actually hit, like, half by an ultra team, but I didn't want to say anything.

01:55:46.380 --> 01:55:48.260
Yeah, but you ain't seen nothing yet.

01:55:48.260 --> 01:55:51.500
There's also the, uh, young drivers, and I don't know if that's you, man, but, uh, there's

01:55:51.500 --> 01:55:53.500
young drivers that are just stupid, like, for instance, today.

01:55:53.500 --> 01:55:54.500
Yeah, I know, I know.

01:55:54.500 --> 01:55:58.500
Park right here at San Juan. There's police cars going everywhere.

01:55:58.500 --> 01:56:01.500
Okay, lights sirens on. There's police cars behind this dumb bitch.

01:56:01.500 --> 01:56:04.500
And she's just standing there, like, she's sitting there at the red light.

01:56:04.500 --> 01:56:06.500
And they're honking their horns. And she's, like, waving her arms.

01:56:06.500 --> 01:56:08.500
I don't know what to do! I don't know what to do!

01:56:08.500 --> 01:56:11.500
Drive forward, you fucking dumbass! You're trying to go someplace.

01:56:11.500 --> 01:56:14.500
So then finally she pulls forward a little bit in front of my car.

01:56:14.500 --> 01:56:17.500
And they nearly hit her ass. And I wish they did because that would serve her right.

01:56:17.500 --> 01:56:24.500
Okay, anyway, back to my FUs, and I'm trying to ground for them, but I think I had a couple

01:56:26.740 --> 01:56:31.740
more, um, wait, let me think, on 2DX, just fuck all the songs that I can't pass, but

01:56:31.740 --> 01:56:37.420
that's not big news, and fuck Lights and Max for me not being able to pass them yet, and

01:56:37.420 --> 01:56:44.100
dammit, fuck my memory for doing this a lot, and forgetting what I was going to say about

01:56:44.100 --> 01:56:49.660

01:56:49.660 --> 01:56:54.660
room FUs are going to get through these quick, I promise. Twenty-third max. Oh, Jesus Christ.

01:56:54.660 --> 01:56:59.900
You send me so many every week. You're going to get quoted first. All right. King-sized

01:56:59.900 --> 01:57:03.860
fuck you to parents who thinks that since they like auto shows, you like auto shows,

01:57:03.860 --> 01:57:07.980

01:57:07.980 --> 01:57:11.420
the hell? I passed it in my sleep. I'm on the Sims. On economics, I go to Scania and

01:57:11.420 --> 01:57:15.420
I now have a round indentation in my right knee when I tried knee dropping. Thank you Max2, I mean fuck you.

01:57:15.420 --> 01:57:19.420
What the fuck were you doing knee dropping anyway?

01:57:19.420 --> 01:57:23.420
Zero in the back says don't miss the panel.

01:57:23.420 --> 01:57:27.420
And an added f-view to being 17. God dammit I can't even leave my friggin house. Give me a break already.

01:57:27.420 --> 01:57:31.420
At least drive me to Scandia once a week. Is that too much fucking much to ask?

01:57:31.420 --> 01:57:35.420
Dark Tetsuya, fuck being single. Still second the fuck to Sakomani's server.

01:57:35.420 --> 01:57:38.420
And fuck simp3 play the world for not letting me play online.

Fuck simp3, play the world for not letting me play online, and lastly, fuck the cold that won't go away.

01:57:43.420 --> 01:57:48.420
Loki, it could be worse, laser force, two words.

01:57:50.420 --> 01:57:51.420
You mean laser ass?

01:57:51.420 --> 01:57:55.420
Alright, EOSFVB says, fuck you to CompUSA for not selling individual bottles of balls,

people who don't like chicken and a biscuit

01:58:18.100 --> 01:58:20.220
good power

01:58:20.220 --> 01:58:22.620
after you waiting at Burger King for twenty minutes and making me miss

01:58:22.620 --> 01:58:26.180
orange lounge as a result of it, F you to teachers yelling at you, F you to teachers

01:58:26.180 --> 01:58:27.740
making you pay for stuff

01:58:27.740 --> 01:58:28.720
welcome to college

01:58:28.720 --> 01:58:33.800
and a huge F you to my eyeglasses breaking on friday

01:58:33.800 --> 01:58:36.960
F you to say my remix's name wrong. Yeah, F you too, buddy.

01:58:36.960 --> 01:58:40.400
Umm...

01:58:40.400 --> 01:58:43.480
Okay. That's it.

01:58:43.480 --> 01:58:44.440
Uhh...

01:58:44.440 --> 01:58:49.480
Snub Disfanoi says, okay, that's too long.

01:58:49.480 --> 01:58:51.120
Okay, F long things, I guess.

01:58:51.120 --> 01:58:55.560
Angel says, fuck you to my cold which refuses to go away, it's been a week.

01:58:55.560 --> 01:58:59.360
Black Lab says, fuck things that get in your eye and irritate it to the point that you can't see out of it,

01:58:59.360 --> 01:59:06.360
fuck long ass programs that suck to code.

01:59:06.360 --> 01:59:12.960
You better watch out when you're giving head.

01:59:12.960 --> 01:59:18.960
More Than Jake says, fuck you to long FUs, they only make your headaches worse.

01:59:18.960 --> 01:59:19.960
Sorry.

01:59:19.960 --> 01:59:23.440
Evil Naoki 2DX says, I want to say fuck you to boredom, and I want to say fuck you to

01:59:23.440 --> 01:59:26.440
people who upload email scripts that rape servers.

01:59:26.440 --> 01:59:28.440
Oh, there's JB's FU. I didn't scroll down to see it.

01:59:28.440 --> 01:59:32.440
FU did not have any cable, so I can download Azumanga Daioh.

01:59:32.440 --> 01:59:34.440
Okay.

01:59:34.440 --> 01:59:38.440
Let's see if we got any over the mailbox. Over at Orange Lounge Radio, yahoo.com.

01:59:38.440 --> 01:59:41.440
Nope. Nothing in the mail.

01:59:41.440 --> 01:59:43.440
If you can't, e-drop?

01:59:43.440 --> 01:59:45.440
No.

01:59:45.440 --> 01:59:47.440
Okay.

01:59:47.440 --> 01:59:52.440
on the radio at yahoo.com.

01:59:52.440 --> 01:59:55.440
Nope, nothing in the mail.

01:59:55.440 --> 01:59:58.440
If you can't e-drop and hit the panel, then just don't e-drop.

01:59:58.440 --> 02:00:04.440
You won't bitch about it.

02:00:04.440 --> 02:00:06.440
Alrighty-dighty.

02:00:06.440 --> 02:00:07.440
Uh, break time?

02:00:07.440 --> 02:00:08.440
Yeah, let's break. I got to pee.

02:00:08.440 --> 02:00:10.440
Let's break. Bathroom break.

02:00:10.440 --> 02:00:12.440
What do we want to hear this break?

02:00:12.440 --> 02:00:15.440
When there's something we want to hear earlier in the show?

02:00:15.440 --> 02:00:16.440
Let's do a disgusting break.

02:00:16.440 --> 02:00:20.640
break. A disgusting break? Like bad music break? Like lots of Eurobeat. Ooh, Eurobeat

02:00:20.640 --> 02:00:26.560
break. Uh, yeah, I know, we don't want to lose all the listeners. Okay, um, alright,

02:00:26.560 --> 02:00:29.720
I got it, I got it, I got it. We can do some of those shitty things from Dance Media X

02:00:29.720 --> 02:00:33.760
2. Okay. Okay, we're gonna do, uh, well, what did you get though? You said I got it, I got

02:00:33.760 --> 02:00:38.560
it. No, just play the... Okay, you wanna hear that? We're gonna hear, we're gonna hear the

02:00:38.560 --> 02:00:43.800
Long Train run-in version by Xtreme, the band that did A Minute and stuff. Do, do let, let

02:00:43.800 --> 02:00:52.800
This is not the same Long Train Runnin' that Bus Stop did, which is in Max 2. This is Extreme's version of it, and it doesn't sound a goddamn thing like the original.

02:00:52.800 --> 02:00:57.800
And after that, we're going to let it go right into Bus Stop with Let the Music Play.

02:00:57.800 --> 02:00:58.800
By the way, this is funny.

02:00:58.800 --> 02:00:59.800
I actually like this mix.

02:00:59.800 --> 02:01:08.800
This is funny. Back before we had the Cage match, and when Jamie and I were the only hosts of the show, and Loki was just a special guest every week, he was the featured player.

02:01:08.800 --> 02:01:12.880
We used to pick every week songs and rotate. I think we still have our last ones in there

02:01:12.880 --> 02:01:17.720
I haven't removed. They've been in there for like three months now, but we had songs that weren't in any bimani game

02:01:17.720 --> 02:01:19.720
But they should be the very first week

02:01:20.040 --> 02:01:22.040
Jamie had picked Shannon

02:01:22.760 --> 02:01:24.760
Shannon let the music play and

02:01:24.880 --> 02:01:29.140
Lo and behold now we have bus stop doing let the music play. All right

02:01:29.760 --> 02:01:36.800
And then I'm supposed to play one of these new promos that some of our fans worked on so I'll I'll get that in there

02:03:36.800 --> 02:03:38.800
If you're a very moving kid, you won't be coming back

02:03:38.800 --> 02:03:40.800
When I'm lost

02:03:41.800 --> 02:03:43.800
When will you be loved?

02:03:45.800 --> 02:03:49.800
You're loved

02:03:50.800 --> 02:03:52.800
Well, I wish you were here

02:03:52.800 --> 02:03:54.800
If you wanna dance

02:04:24.800 --> 02:04:31.800
We got love

02:04:31.800 --> 02:04:38.800
We got love

02:04:38.800 --> 02:05:04.000
Welcome to the Orange Lunch Radio, where pub is orange.

02:05:04.000 --> 02:05:05.880
Shaving monkeys is always permitted.

02:05:05.880 --> 02:05:06.880
Just kidding.

02:05:06.880 --> 02:05:07.880
But...

02:05:07.880 --> 02:05:08.880
But?

02:05:08.880 --> 02:05:09.880
Yes?

02:05:09.880 --> 02:05:11.760
Check into the plan until it poos on your face.

02:05:11.760 --> 02:05:12.760
You scared the monkey?

02:05:12.760 --> 02:05:13.760
You don't come in.

02:05:13.760 --> 02:05:14.760
No, no, no.

02:05:14.760 --> 02:05:15.760
I'll just bring Shermy.

02:05:15.760 --> 02:05:16.760
If Shermy doesn't like you, leave.

02:05:16.760 --> 02:05:18.760
No, no, I'll just bring Shermy.

02:05:20.760 --> 02:05:22.760
If Shermy doesn't like you, leave.

02:05:22.760 --> 02:05:26.760
Proceeding, as always, was brought to you by Orange Lounge Radio.

02:05:52.760 --> 02:05:54.760
Get into the groove

02:05:55.760 --> 02:05:57.760
Start to start the beat

02:05:59.760 --> 02:06:03.760
We started dancing and love put us into a groove

02:06:03.760 --> 02:06:06.760
As soon as we started to move

02:06:12.760 --> 02:06:16.760
The music played while our bodies were playing all the dance

02:06:16.760 --> 02:06:23.760
We started dancing and love put us into the groove

02:06:23.760 --> 02:06:31.760
As soon as we started to move, as soon as we started to move

02:06:31.760 --> 02:06:39.760
And I say, let the music play, we won't get away

02:07:09.760 --> 02:07:11.760
Look at Dan, he's what I see

02:07:12.760 --> 02:07:14.760
He's dancing his way back to me

02:07:20.760 --> 02:07:25.760
Guess who's the real me? I truly love this mansion from the very start

02:07:26.760 --> 02:07:29.760
Love just can't be proved, cause every time we move

02:07:30.760 --> 02:07:32.760
Even though we dance the part

02:07:33.760 --> 02:07:37.760
We've started dancing and love was a sin to the groove

02:07:37.760 --> 02:07:46.760
As soon as we turn it to blue As soon as we turn it to blue

02:07:46.760 --> 02:07:50.760
I say, let the music play You won't get away

02:07:50.760 --> 02:07:54.760
Just beat the groove and then he'll somehow see you again

02:07:54.760 --> 02:07:57.760
Let the music play You won't get away

02:07:57.760 --> 02:08:02.760
Just do the cannonball, he won't leave you anymore

02:08:02.760 --> 02:08:04.760
No, no, no, no

02:08:04.760 --> 02:08:08.120
Stop, music play, music play, music play

02:08:08.120 --> 02:08:11.560
Get away, this time to get away

02:08:11.560 --> 02:08:16.720

And there's another one

02:11:10.720 --> 02:11:14.720
And that's the truth and that's the reason

The truth of every day

02:12:00.720 --> 02:12:03.720
Rising in that big red

02:12:03.720 --> 02:12:07.720
The world falls because of love

02:12:07.720 --> 02:12:10.720
And never ever

02:12:50.720 --> 02:12:53.760
And death on the rainbow

02:12:53.760 --> 02:12:58.100
We have lost the one that I've already been

02:12:58.100 --> 02:13:00.800
Story

02:13:00.800 --> 02:13:04.200
Ah, ah, ah, ah

Ah, ah, ah, ah

02:13:11.300 --> 02:13:15.160

Ah, ah, ah, ah

02:13:18.480 --> 02:13:23.480

Hello? Hello, is this thing on? Testing? Testing one, two

02:13:40.480 --> 02:13:45.480
I'm looking in the index, but I don't see anything for how to run a radio show

02:13:45.480 --> 02:13:51.800
I don't understand this thing works this thing reads like stereo instructions is this on the hell

02:13:54.280 --> 02:13:58.160
Orange lounge radio broke down ghetto Pamani radio

02:14:00.080 --> 02:14:01.480
Hi, we're back

02:14:01.480 --> 02:14:06.720
You're listening to orange lounge radio as we promised during that last one that was creamy with the never

02:14:06.720 --> 02:14:12.240
I was creamy with the never-ending story from dance mania ex2 so it could be a ddr very possibly

02:14:12.240 --> 02:14:16.240
And of course we had some people, we had DDRholic says, it's so cute!

02:14:16.240 --> 02:14:17.240
And what did she say that was really funny?

02:14:17.240 --> 02:14:19.240
It was something about, God, what was it?

02:14:19.240 --> 02:14:22.240
It was really funny, she said.

02:14:22.240 --> 02:14:25.240
Something about hamsters dancing in the sky or something like that.

02:14:25.240 --> 02:14:26.240
It was really funny.

02:14:26.240 --> 02:14:27.240
I can't find it.

02:14:27.240 --> 02:14:28.240
Oh well.

02:14:28.240 --> 02:14:31.240
And then of course we have Arcadian says it sucks.

02:14:31.240 --> 02:14:34.240
And EOSFVB says this song should be banned.

02:14:34.240 --> 02:14:37.240
The song gives me an aneurysm.

02:14:37.240 --> 02:14:43.240
We won't be in regular Orange Lounge rotation anytime soon, but we reserve the right to play it during any fuck-off we want.

02:14:43.240 --> 02:14:44.240
All right.

02:14:44.240 --> 02:14:45.240
Listless.

02:14:45.240 --> 02:14:47.240
I don't think anybody did a fuck-off show this week.

02:14:47.240 --> 02:14:49.240
This is the first week of Orange Lounge with no fuck-off shows.

02:14:49.240 --> 02:14:50.240
Because you're having Rocky to do.

02:14:50.240 --> 02:14:51.240
We have a light.

02:14:51.240 --> 02:14:52.240
We have a life.

02:14:52.240 --> 02:14:53.240
All right.

02:14:53.240 --> 02:14:54.240
If we end up moving in together, Loki, you'll be able to do it.

02:14:54.240 --> 02:14:55.240
I'm doing Tuesday.

02:14:55.240 --> 02:14:56.240
All right.

02:14:56.240 --> 02:14:57.240
Here we go.

02:14:57.240 --> 02:15:03.240
Tonight's Listless was inspired by a thread on our forums, and if you haven't visited our forums, why the fuck not?

02:15:03.240 --> 02:15:05.240
You need to get your ass over there right now and sign up.

02:15:05.240 --> 02:15:12.240
The address is right in the topic of our chat room. It's also linked from our website, orangelounge.skie.cx

02:15:12.240 --> 02:15:16.240
And then you just click on forums. It'll take you right there. Or if you need the website, here it is.

02:15:16.240 --> 02:15:19.240
www.calibomani.com

02:15:19.240 --> 02:15:22.240
slash nbor3

02:15:22.240 --> 02:15:29.240
And we merged with the Naoki Boards of Randomness because they rock and we're part of their forums.

02:15:29.240 --> 02:15:33.240
So, you need to get your ass over there to the Orange Lounge forums.

02:15:33.240 --> 02:15:36.860
because this was an idea that came from the listless suggestion thread and who would have

02:15:36.860 --> 02:15:45.860
thunk it? Dave was the one that suggested this topic. Yay! So you should go post in

02:15:45.860 --> 02:15:49.060
that listless suggestion thread if you think you have an idea because we're doing this

02:15:49.060 --> 02:15:55.700
one tonight. It was Dave's idea. Best warm-up song for DDR? I go first. So what exactly

02:15:55.700 --> 02:16:01.340
would be a warm-up song? You don't have to name it, but describe a warm-up song. What

02:16:01.340 --> 02:16:03.340
What defines a warm-up song?

02:16:03.340 --> 02:16:12.340
The first song you play as a warm-up for your other songs that might be more physically demanding.

02:16:12.340 --> 02:16:16.340
I think that when we say what our pick is, we should say why we like it as a warm-up song.

02:16:16.340 --> 02:16:20.340
Yes. And it's basically, there goes the mic.

02:16:20.340 --> 02:16:28.340
And I would basically think that it would be something very fun and easygoing and not too challenging because...

02:16:28.340 --> 02:16:30.340
Just starting.

02:16:30.340 --> 02:16:35.240
Yes, it depends on what you're, if you're warming up for Legend of the Max, you might

02:16:35.240 --> 02:16:37.140
play Max 300, I don't know.

02:16:37.140 --> 02:16:38.140
Ah!

02:16:38.140 --> 02:16:41.220
Um, we have a request before we get started.

02:16:41.220 --> 02:16:43.060
Angel wants you to say we.

02:16:43.060 --> 02:16:44.060
We!

02:16:44.060 --> 02:16:45.060
Okay.

02:16:45.060 --> 02:16:46.060
That's it.

02:16:46.060 --> 02:16:47.060
Alright.

02:16:47.060 --> 02:16:48.060
And do the black mage.

02:16:48.060 --> 02:16:51.060
Wait, what does he do again?

02:16:51.060 --> 02:16:52.060
The bolt thing.

02:16:52.060 --> 02:16:53.060
Nevermind.

02:16:53.060 --> 02:16:54.060
Forget it.

02:16:54.060 --> 02:16:56.180
Let's just, let's just get into it.

02:16:56.180 --> 02:16:57.900
Alright Dave, you start.

02:16:57.900 --> 02:16:58.900
Okay.

02:16:58.900 --> 02:17:00.900
The first one is...

02:17:00.900 --> 02:17:01.900
Oh.

02:17:01.900 --> 02:17:02.900
Oh yeah!

02:17:02.900 --> 02:17:04.900
I'm being lazy tonight.

02:17:04.900 --> 02:17:06.900
No, Jamie, you need to memorize all of these.

02:17:06.900 --> 02:17:08.900
I don't want to erase the erotic ones.

02:17:08.900 --> 02:17:09.900
I'll just do it underneath, though.

02:17:09.900 --> 02:17:10.900
Do it on this page.

02:17:10.900 --> 02:17:11.900
Okay, here we go.

02:17:11.900 --> 02:17:12.900
Sam, lick my clam.

02:17:12.900 --> 02:17:13.900
No, um...

02:17:13.900 --> 02:17:15.900
Okay, I think...

02:17:15.900 --> 02:17:17.900
Yes, Rob?

02:17:17.900 --> 02:17:18.900
Sorry, I'm just laughing.

02:17:18.900 --> 02:17:19.900
I'm laughing.

02:17:19.900 --> 02:17:22.900
DDRholic already gave us a suggestion for Jane Johnna

02:17:22.900 --> 02:17:25.900
because it's so smooth and it makes you want to pinch your butt cheeks.

02:17:25.900 --> 02:17:27.900
What?

02:17:27.900 --> 02:17:37.380
My first one is Moonlight Shadow because it was really fun and I played it on doubles

02:17:37.380 --> 02:17:51.660
all the time right before I played Oops I Did It Again, Fire It Up Mix, Did It.

02:17:51.660 --> 02:17:57.820
And I really liked that one on doubles and it has lots of movement and it was fun.

02:17:57.820 --> 02:18:00.640
We'll just go around this way, shake it up a little, because Jamie and I never really

02:18:00.640 --> 02:18:01.640
go in the middle.

02:18:01.640 --> 02:18:02.640
Next.

02:18:02.640 --> 02:18:04.980
We always go either first or last, so we'll be in the middle this time.

02:18:04.980 --> 02:18:08.660
So who's the fruit and who's the meat?

02:18:08.660 --> 02:18:09.660
Gee.

02:18:09.660 --> 02:18:14.340
Okay, my number three choice was, this is a fun one, La Copa Da Vida.

02:18:14.340 --> 02:18:15.340
Holy bitch.

02:18:15.340 --> 02:18:17.340
What's the point of mine?

02:18:17.340 --> 02:18:18.340
Oh my God.

02:18:18.340 --> 02:18:19.900
So change yours.

02:18:19.900 --> 02:18:24.260
La Copa Da Vida because it's pretty easy to perfect attack, yet it has a lot of different

02:18:24.260 --> 02:18:25.260
things in it.

02:18:25.260 --> 02:18:27.500
eight notes and uh... you know what

02:18:27.500 --> 02:18:30.740
people cringe when they hear a ricky martin cover but the song it actually

02:18:30.740 --> 02:18:34.120
isn't that bad i mean it's it's yeah

02:18:34.120 --> 02:18:36.100
did that come here at that was

02:18:36.100 --> 02:18:39.140
my first choice but

02:18:39.140 --> 02:18:40.580
my sorry

02:18:40.580 --> 02:18:41.460
yes jimmy sherman

02:18:41.460 --> 02:18:43.780
my number three pick is cockamamie act

02:18:43.780 --> 02:18:47.580
cockamamie

02:18:47.580 --> 02:18:49.740
how many years i

02:18:49.740 --> 02:18:52.460
and a lot of people notice that i don't play with freezers i do it for a

02:18:52.460 --> 02:18:56.340
legitimate reason because of my ankle being weak if I have to hold my foot in

02:18:56.340 --> 02:18:59.740
one position for entirely too long especially when I'm stepping the other

02:18:59.740 --> 02:19:04.580
way it hurts the thing I like about cockamamie is that it's very easy as the

02:19:04.580 --> 02:19:07.860
gallops help me you know warm up my legs and everything and get my knees to where

02:19:07.860 --> 02:19:11.180
they don't hurt and then it at the end of the song it goes into their run so

02:19:11.180 --> 02:19:19.540
I'm building up into something better I actually have legitimate reasons good

02:19:19.540 --> 02:19:31.540
My number 3 would be doing Miracle Moon on Doubles on the Heavy. Mostly because it'll work me up into doing my freestyle stuff like Let the Beat Head.

02:19:31.540 --> 02:19:33.540
Do you want to specifically say Doubles Heavy or just Miracle Moon?

02:19:33.540 --> 02:19:38.540
Miracle Moon Double. Because it's not very hard on Single.

02:19:38.540 --> 02:19:45.540
Alright. Miracle Moon. Loki, your number 3 pick.

02:19:45.540 --> 02:19:47.540
It's all about Superstar Heavy.

02:19:47.540 --> 02:19:49.540
superstar

02:19:49.540 --> 02:19:50.980
uh...

02:19:50.980 --> 02:19:52.060
uh...

02:19:52.060 --> 02:19:53.520
i knew that would happen

02:19:53.520 --> 02:19:56.900
that's why i didn't put superstar stay with mexico

02:19:56.900 --> 02:19:59.320
you guys were totally

02:19:59.320 --> 02:20:00.360
all right

02:20:00.360 --> 02:20:02.380
uh... david number to pick

02:20:10.700 --> 02:20:12.860
send your e dot

02:20:12.860 --> 02:20:15.260
i always play that right after a political but they love you to be a

02:20:15.260 --> 02:20:19.100

to it you know it my number two pick is this rain immense oh that's not surprised because it's uh

02:20:38.300 --> 02:20:43.320

it's a mental warm-up call 0 you never too big

02:21:04.880 --> 02:21:11.520
My second one is Little Bitch, because not only does it match the specials shirt I just

02:21:11.520 --> 02:21:18.520
got the other day, but it's a good warm up for going into my ska routine that I'm working

02:21:18.520 --> 02:21:19.520
on.

02:21:19.520 --> 02:21:20.520
It'll be good when I get it done.

02:21:20.520 --> 02:21:24.080
So we're talking about the original Little Bitch, not Bus Stops 1-2 Little Bitch, just

02:21:24.080 --> 02:21:25.080
to clarify.

02:21:25.080 --> 02:21:26.080
No, the original original specials.

02:21:26.080 --> 02:21:27.080
Cool!

02:21:27.080 --> 02:21:34.080
Yeah, let's see. Let's Groove, um, Heavy. Let's Groove tonight. Disney's like, oh, let's

02:21:39.040 --> 02:21:46.040
eat arrow. Wait, wait, wait, arrow. Let's Groove tonight. Oh, hello. Okay, Dave. Earth

02:21:46.040 --> 02:21:51.040
Let's screw up tonight, all night long.

02:21:51.040 --> 02:21:53.040
Okay, Dave.

02:21:53.040 --> 02:21:55.040
Earth wouldn't fire, you ain't.

02:21:55.040 --> 02:21:56.040
Okay.

02:21:56.040 --> 02:21:57.040
I got fired out.

02:21:57.040 --> 02:22:03.040
Anyway, my number one actually has a story kind of behind it, and it was a long-

02:22:03.040 --> 02:22:06.040
The story is that your real number one got taken.

02:22:06.040 --> 02:22:11.040
Well that, that was, it was a story for my number two, but now it's, you know, moved on up the list.

02:22:11.040 --> 02:22:14.040
And because I can't think of anything else off the top of my head.

02:22:14.040 --> 02:22:20.480
And it was I think a year or a year and a half ago, maybe two years, and wow, Jamie

02:22:20.480 --> 02:22:25.480
is holding a lighting pen up to her forehead so she can see the lights.

02:22:25.480 --> 02:22:33.960
And it was the first time that I ever met Rob and Jamie and all these other people that

02:22:33.960 --> 02:22:38.720
I thought were really weird at the time.

02:22:38.720 --> 02:22:45.800
I played with Rob the first time before I met him on a 4th mix at Roseville Golf Land

02:22:45.800 --> 02:22:51.720
and he picked, I don't know, was it Bumblebee or something like that, you know, one of the

02:22:51.720 --> 02:22:58.640
songs that my brother plays with me, and then I picked Dropout, and that's my choice, just

02:22:58.640 --> 02:23:04.160
Dropout, because it was so fun, and Rob was just like gasping for breath, he's like, this

02:23:04.160 --> 02:23:09.760
this is my first game. Oh my god. And I was like, sorry. And then I picked Afro Nova afterwards

02:23:09.760 --> 02:23:17.160
to fuck with him. No, but Dropout because it's really fun. And yeah. Yeah. It gets me

02:23:17.160 --> 02:23:22.160
warmed up, you ass. Alright. That made me think though, I left one off my list, I really

02:23:22.160 --> 02:23:25.460
want to put one here, but I guess next time. But the number one, and it deserves to be

02:23:25.460 --> 02:23:28.960
my number one because this was the ultimate warm up song, especially back in the day.

02:23:28.960 --> 02:23:33.940
I always played this first song, you know it. This song is the shit. Oh Nick, please

02:23:33.940 --> 02:23:35.500
it's not so quick

02:23:35.500 --> 02:23:38.520
tried all the fighting time

02:23:38.520 --> 02:23:41.620
we got the fourth makes you like oh my god i love you on it

02:23:41.620 --> 02:23:43.440
i want to have a machine

02:23:43.440 --> 02:23:46.620
let's see if i can fit in the coin slot

02:23:46.620 --> 02:23:48.120
please

02:23:48.120 --> 02:23:52.760
i actually remember you saying that once

02:23:52.760 --> 02:23:59.500
it would surprise me it was right before my birthday come to think of it

02:23:59.500 --> 02:24:01.500
my number one

02:24:01.500 --> 02:24:04.500
Well, my original number one got taken, so my number two moved up.

02:24:04.500 --> 02:24:07.500
And everyone knows that I've been starting off with this a lot lately.

02:24:07.500 --> 02:24:10.500
Cowgirl maniac.

02:24:10.500 --> 02:24:12.500
Just because the little skippy hops.

02:24:12.500 --> 02:24:16.500
I normally suck at skippy hops, and now I can do skippy hops really well.

02:24:16.500 --> 02:24:18.500
The skippy hops.

02:24:18.500 --> 02:24:24.500
Because they're not the true, I don't consider them true gallops like in, you know, saints go marching or like in rhythm and police.

02:24:24.500 --> 02:24:26.500
They're skippy hops.

02:24:26.500 --> 02:24:28.500
Skippy hops?

02:24:58.500 --> 02:25:00.500
I'll have to take that

02:25:01.180 --> 02:25:03.180
Spin to disc

02:25:03.980 --> 02:25:08.900
Last one Loki. What is it number one warm-up song? I played this yesterday

02:25:09.140 --> 02:25:13.500
But have us fucked up this stupid fucking pad

02:25:14.340 --> 02:25:15.780
moving on

02:25:15.780 --> 02:25:17.340
moving on

02:25:17.340 --> 02:25:23.540
Moving on from fifth mix. There's only mix it was in it was so cool and they took it out. No

02:25:23.540 --> 02:25:26.380
Oh.

02:25:26.380 --> 02:25:28.380
With a close second by Kongafelon.

02:25:28.380 --> 02:25:29.380
Oh, Kongafelon.

02:25:29.380 --> 02:25:30.380
I love Kongafelon.

02:25:30.380 --> 02:25:31.380
Damn it.

02:25:31.380 --> 02:25:32.380
All right.

02:25:32.380 --> 02:25:33.380
So, list so far.

02:25:33.380 --> 02:25:34.380
You want to read it, Jamie?

02:25:34.380 --> 02:25:35.380
You want me to read it?

02:25:35.380 --> 02:25:36.380
Yeah.

02:25:36.380 --> 02:25:37.380
Wait a minute.

02:25:37.380 --> 02:25:42.500
We have Moonlight Shadow, La Copa Da Vida, Cockaman Maniac, Miracle Moon Doubles, Superstar,

02:25:42.500 --> 02:25:46.380
Senorita, It's Raining Men, Share My Love, Little Bitch, Let's Groove, Dropout, A Nick

02:25:46.380 --> 02:25:50.540
Please Not So Quick, Cloud Girls, Spin the Disc, We're Fun.

02:25:50.540 --> 02:25:51.540
Rad.

02:25:51.540 --> 02:25:52.540
Now, songs we forgot.

02:25:52.540 --> 02:25:57.540
I forgot, and it didn't hit me until part of the way through when Dave was reminiscing about 4th Mix, I forgot the qua.

02:25:57.540 --> 02:25:59.540
That used to be the ultimate warmup song.

02:25:59.540 --> 02:26:00.540
Yeah, me too.

02:26:00.540 --> 02:26:04.540
You know what, I'm remembering my usual set on 1.5.

02:26:04.540 --> 02:26:09.540
I would start off with Boom Boom Dollar, Trick.

02:26:09.540 --> 02:26:11.540
Yeah, I used to play that a lot too.

02:26:11.540 --> 02:26:21.540
It would always be Boom Boom Dollar, and then My Fire, and then it would be Brilliant to You OG.

02:26:21.540 --> 02:26:22.540
Cool.

02:26:22.540 --> 02:26:23.540
Cool.

02:26:23.540 --> 02:26:30.060
No, but I was thinking about doing Synchronized Love, because it's really fun, and it's kind

02:26:30.060 --> 02:26:31.060
of.

02:26:31.060 --> 02:26:32.060
But, no.

02:26:32.060 --> 02:26:33.780
Anyway, so I have to take one off, huh?

02:26:33.780 --> 02:26:34.780
Yeah.

02:26:34.780 --> 02:26:37.300
Damn, these are all pretty good choices.

02:26:37.300 --> 02:26:42.620
And I play them all fairly a lot, yeah.

02:26:42.620 --> 02:26:50.780
But damn it, no, no, I like that song too much.

02:26:50.780 --> 02:26:55.780
I think Let's Groove goes bye-bye.

02:26:55.780 --> 02:26:56.780
I don't know.

02:26:56.780 --> 02:26:59.780
Too slow and not enough fun.

02:26:59.780 --> 02:27:04.780
I'm just saying Let's Groove is sort of one of my cool-down songs if I need to take a breather.

02:27:04.780 --> 02:27:05.780
I don't know.

02:27:05.780 --> 02:27:07.780
It's more of a cool-down than a warm-up.

02:27:07.780 --> 02:27:10.780
You know, I'd let the beat hit him in the same category.

02:27:10.780 --> 02:27:11.780
Yeah, same.

02:27:11.780 --> 02:27:19.780
I do one of those songs in between playing an extreme edit and doing my PA for Legend of Max qualifier thing.

02:27:19.780 --> 02:27:26.780
These are all pretty good picks, however, I'm just a bitter little asshole, I'm taking off Dropout.

02:27:26.780 --> 02:27:35.780
What the hell are you smoking? Dropout as a warm-up? I mean, I guess so. I mean, especially, you know, as the bar's kind of been raising and raising,

02:27:35.780 --> 02:27:42.780
I remember when most people used to go, oh my god, you can pass Dropout Maniac, and you were like the shit if you could pass Dropout Maniac, and now it's nothing.

02:27:42.780 --> 02:27:46.640
you know so I can see where it's kind of that level of warm-up so I know but I

02:27:46.640 --> 02:27:49.560
mean for some people for some people I'm safe for the people that it used to be

02:27:49.560 --> 02:27:52.920
oh my god I know but I'm safe for the people that used to be oh my gods now

02:27:52.920 --> 02:27:59.340
it's like you have to be able to pass max 300 three-speed shuffle exactly so

02:27:59.340 --> 02:28:02.220
it's like you know I can see where for some people that's a warm-up level song

02:28:02.220 --> 02:28:07.400
but no and I remember the old guys sorry just for a little more reminiscing even

02:28:07.400 --> 02:28:11.840
though I'm sure no one else or I doubt it maybe Bradley was there but when I

02:28:11.840 --> 02:28:16.640
I was talking to Rob later, he's like, yeah, I can't pass Ninzabro either, or Ninzabro,

02:28:16.640 --> 02:28:17.640
yeah, whatever.

02:28:17.640 --> 02:28:21.040
And he's like, that's one of the golden cats that I can't pass, and I was like, what the

02:28:21.040 --> 02:28:22.040
hell is that?

02:28:22.040 --> 02:28:26.320
He's like a catastrophic, and I was like, oh, the name!

02:28:26.320 --> 02:28:30.120
Because they didn't have him on fourth mix, and I'd never played a nine on third, and

02:28:30.120 --> 02:28:31.120
so I didn't know it.

02:28:31.120 --> 02:28:34.120
And I was like, wow.

02:28:34.120 --> 02:28:35.120
The name was catastrophic.

02:28:35.120 --> 02:28:36.720
But the actual little name, yeah.

02:28:36.720 --> 02:28:37.720
Yeah.

02:28:37.720 --> 02:28:40.080
Because they don't have the names catastrophic and all that stuff.

02:28:40.080 --> 02:28:41.080
Alright, Jamie?

02:28:41.080 --> 02:28:42.080
Oh.

02:28:42.080 --> 02:28:46.760
Um, I take off La Copa de Vida just because I hate that song.

02:28:46.760 --> 02:28:47.760
You poopy face.

02:28:47.760 --> 02:28:48.760
And you know what?

02:28:48.760 --> 02:28:52.640
That song, actually, it was fun in samba de amigo.

02:28:52.640 --> 02:28:54.640
I don't care.

02:28:54.640 --> 02:28:57.600
It was fun in samba de amigo, but sucks for DDR.

02:28:57.600 --> 02:29:03.640
Did you see my routine to it, where I do the pelvic thrust of the whole song?

02:29:03.640 --> 02:29:04.640
Drive you insane.

02:29:04.640 --> 02:29:07.320
That's all the more reason for me not to sing it.

02:29:07.320 --> 02:29:09.320
That's all the more reason for me not to sing it.

02:29:09.320 --> 02:29:11.420
you're too young

02:29:11.420 --> 02:29:14.100
moving on

02:29:14.100 --> 02:29:15.500
take your earlier

02:29:15.500 --> 02:29:16.400

02:29:16.400 --> 02:29:20.140
probably take out senior eda

02:29:20.140 --> 02:29:26.140

02:29:26.140 --> 02:29:29.160
send your readout comes off the list one lady's crying

02:29:29.160 --> 02:29:30.120

02:29:30.120 --> 02:29:30.700
favorite

02:29:30.700 --> 02:29:32.320
songs a lot of people don't like this

02:29:32.320 --> 02:29:34.340
loop on the seventy third

02:29:34.340 --> 02:29:37.400
i don't know if i consider that a warm-up is

02:29:37.400 --> 02:29:42.900
Yeah, but not the maniac stuff, but like the easier, like the trick beginning.

02:29:42.900 --> 02:29:45.400
By the way, it's Lupin the Third.

02:29:45.400 --> 02:29:47.400
Lupin the Third was anime.

02:29:54.400 --> 02:29:55.400
Here we go.

02:29:55.400 --> 02:29:57.400
Loki, last one, what's coming off?

02:29:57.400 --> 02:30:01.900
You know, I hate this song on maniac doubles, and it can kiss my ass,

02:30:01.900 --> 02:30:04.400
because that is no six, bitch.

02:30:04.400 --> 02:30:05.900
Moonlight Shadow.

02:30:05.900 --> 02:30:09.580
moonlight shadow

02:30:09.580 --> 02:30:12.740
yeah i don't know about a warm-up i think the singles spain act

02:30:12.740 --> 02:30:16.440

02:30:16.440 --> 02:30:18.260

Wee!

02:35:50.640 --> 02:35:52.840
Hi, we're back.

02:35:52.840 --> 02:35:59.280
Jamie, do you want to do a shout out?

02:35:59.280 --> 02:36:00.280
Wee, wee, wee!

02:36:00.280 --> 02:36:02.800
You want to do a shout out?

02:36:02.800 --> 02:36:03.800
Yes.

02:36:03.800 --> 02:36:04.800
To Jack...

02:36:04.800 --> 02:36:05.800
Shout out!

02:36:05.800 --> 02:36:06.800
Sorry, ow!

02:36:06.800 --> 02:36:12.800
My shout-out goes to Jahi for staying with me while I was going insane driving around, so thank you.

02:36:12.800 --> 02:36:13.800
Thank you, Jahi.

02:36:13.800 --> 02:36:15.800
My blood sugar sucks.

02:36:15.800 --> 02:36:16.800
Cool.

02:36:16.800 --> 02:36:19.800
Jahi is the man. He's the shit. He's awesome.

02:36:19.800 --> 02:36:21.800
And he has very interesting things to say late at night.

02:36:21.800 --> 02:36:22.800
Everybody needs to know a Jahi.

02:36:22.800 --> 02:36:24.800
He needs to be on the show.

02:36:24.800 --> 02:36:27.800
He needs to be on the show. Like, here.

02:36:27.800 --> 02:36:31.800
He's been via tape, he's never been here, but hopefully soon, right kids?

02:36:31.800 --> 02:36:32.800
We hope.

02:36:32.800 --> 02:36:34.800
He's been talking about moving, maybe. I don't know if that would happen.

02:36:34.800 --> 02:36:35.800
During a drug show.

02:36:35.800 --> 02:36:39.880
a drunk show. Maybe you should get them next week. Jahi would be a suitable replacement

02:36:39.880 --> 02:36:41.680
for me, because we're so alike.

02:36:41.680 --> 02:36:46.280
I think that Jahi would be as difficult to get drunk as me.

02:36:46.280 --> 02:36:49.600
That'd be interesting. Well, it's a three hour show.

02:36:49.600 --> 02:36:53.320
A three hour train wreck.

02:36:53.320 --> 02:36:58.620
Alright, you want to hear the winners of Listless? Yes you do. Best warm up song? I need drum

02:36:58.620 --> 02:37:05.620
rules people. Third place! That's the most unenthusiastic. That was you slapping yourself.

02:37:05.620 --> 02:37:09.500
Alright, applause, whatever. There you go, there you go. Third place is... The audience

02:37:09.500 --> 02:37:15.780
is now deaf. The audience is horny. Third place is... Spin the disc, I mean. Spin the

02:37:15.780 --> 02:37:22.580
disc! Spin my disc. Alright, spin the disc is number three winner. Number two winner

02:37:22.580 --> 02:37:30.140
Superstar is the number one winner, and I must say this even surprised me, but it's

02:37:30.140 --> 02:37:31.140
beautiful.

02:37:31.140 --> 02:37:37.380
Oh Nick, please not so quick is the number one best DDR warm-up song, amazing.

02:37:37.380 --> 02:37:38.560
How did that happen?

02:37:38.560 --> 02:37:44.180
I don't know.

02:37:44.180 --> 02:37:50.840
But it is the best, best DDR warm-up song.

02:37:50.840 --> 02:37:53.200
Very close call though.

02:37:53.200 --> 02:37:56.280
More than Jake's, very pissy because little bitch didn't get in there, but it was very

02:37:56.280 --> 02:37:57.280
close.

02:37:57.280 --> 02:37:58.280
It was very close.

02:37:58.280 --> 02:37:59.280
Sorry.

02:37:59.280 --> 02:38:01.640
I just explained something to Zero.

02:38:01.640 --> 02:38:02.640
What did you have to explain?

02:38:02.640 --> 02:38:07.160
When he said, oh no please not so quick, wondering how it got into DDR, I said, it's so small.

02:38:07.160 --> 02:38:09.520
Like the Chinpoko mine episode of South Park.

02:38:09.520 --> 02:38:12.040
I just explained to Zero what Chinpoko means.

02:38:12.040 --> 02:38:16.160
It means small penis.

02:38:16.160 --> 02:38:23.160
Alright, so Evil Naoki 2DX is celebrating by humping 3rd Korean machines across the United States.

02:38:26.160 --> 02:38:31.160
Caution off of whatever version of 3rd it was, 3rd Korean whatever, that was a good song.

02:38:31.160 --> 02:38:36.160
No, you know what the best fucking 3rd Korean song is ever? No, Waa.

02:38:36.160 --> 02:38:40.160
Waa is the shit. No, Waa.

02:38:40.160 --> 02:38:42.160
Face. Face is okay.

02:38:42.160 --> 02:38:44.160
By the way, speaking of...

02:38:44.160 --> 02:38:46.160
No!

02:38:46.160 --> 02:38:51.160
I remember the fucking guy at Golf Land that used to be able to do Beall backwards.

02:38:51.160 --> 02:38:53.160
He was one of our originals.

02:38:53.160 --> 02:38:55.160
I remember that guy.

02:38:55.160 --> 02:38:58.160
He used to do Beall backwards and we'd all go eww Beall.

02:38:58.160 --> 02:39:01.160
He would do the perfect boy band dance to it.

02:39:01.160 --> 02:39:04.160
Yeah he does. He had a perfect boy band dance to it. That was great.

02:39:04.160 --> 02:39:07.160
Okay. Let's just stop the show.

02:39:07.160 --> 02:39:11.160
It's alright. We're reminiscing about Beall. That's when you know we're desperate for material.

02:39:11.160 --> 02:39:13.560
Okay, now we should do our other favorite segment.

02:39:13.560 --> 02:39:14.760
What?

02:39:14.760 --> 02:39:16.360
Ask Orange Laughs!

02:39:16.360 --> 02:39:19.960
Haven't we beat this segment into the ground? Haven't they asked all their questions?

02:39:19.960 --> 02:39:22.160
Let's do Storytime-a-Loki. You have a story?

02:39:22.160 --> 02:39:25.560
Uh, it's something that reminded me. Yeah, I have a story.

02:39:25.560 --> 02:39:27.260
Great, we get to do Storytime-a-Loki.

02:39:27.260 --> 02:39:29.760
If we can do a really quick Ask Orange Laughs segment.

02:39:29.760 --> 02:39:33.760
If you want to surprise and message me questions, ask Orange Laughs Sunday.

02:39:33.760 --> 02:39:36.460
It's sending questions, and it'll be a really quick story.

02:39:36.460 --> 02:39:39.260
And it's unfortunately not porn related, so...

02:39:39.260 --> 02:39:42.420
all what fun is that sorry

02:39:42.420 --> 02:39:45.900

02:39:45.900 --> 02:39:49.520
to let's uh... storytime a low-key what what

02:39:49.520 --> 02:39:52.500
i know but that's art

02:39:52.500 --> 02:39:56.020
whatever it doesn't matter if this is going to be so quick anyways will do it

02:39:56.020 --> 02:39:58.880
with this is the funny

02:39:58.880 --> 02:40:02.340
so let me go and just started with uh... i mean i was going to say guys about

02:40:02.340 --> 02:40:05.500
this uh... one person

02:40:05.500 --> 02:40:07.860
woman

02:40:07.860 --> 02:40:12.860
She had to be in her thirties, if not older, in her forties and something like that, and she's still playing Qsar.

02:40:12.860 --> 02:40:17.860
And she was like, this is what happens, this is what happens when...

02:40:17.860 --> 02:40:19.860
I'm almost thirty and I have like, retarded people.

02:40:19.860 --> 02:40:22.860
This is what happens when retarded people grow up, alright?

02:40:22.860 --> 02:40:26.860
And they serve no purpose in society other than just to annoy you.

02:40:26.860 --> 02:40:33.860
So this bitch, looking to find where she fit in, she thought she fit in with Qsar, while she was terribly wrong.

02:40:33.860 --> 02:40:43.860
She sucked ass, she was playing for like five years, and the reason she likes playing is because the packs vibrate, and she likes vibrating packs.

02:40:43.860 --> 02:40:51.860
And she got pissed off and we'd shoot her up, which we'd always use the tag for her, like how it was playing.

02:40:51.860 --> 02:40:53.860
Because she was retarded.

02:40:55.860 --> 02:40:59.860
That's not nice! And that's my story, and that's it.

02:40:59.860 --> 02:41:08.860
That's my story, and she bought a pack and built her own mini arena in her house, and

02:41:08.860 --> 02:41:09.860
she sucks.

02:41:09.860 --> 02:41:11.860
And her name was Zap-Zap.

02:41:11.860 --> 02:41:14.860
Her husband's name was Zip-Zip.

02:41:14.860 --> 02:41:21.860
Zip-Zip and Zap-Zap, that's what I'm gonna name my kids.

02:41:21.860 --> 02:41:23.860
So there you go.

02:41:23.860 --> 02:41:27.540
Alright, we're actually getting quite a few questions for Ask Orange Lounge, so I won't

02:41:27.540 --> 02:41:28.540
berate Loki anymore.

02:41:28.540 --> 02:41:31.680
make him tell a better story but we're actually getting quite a few questions

02:41:31.680 --> 02:41:34.800

02:41:53.160 --> 02:41:54.160
Show me.

02:41:57.160 --> 02:42:00.160
What did you take out of my pocket? What did you take out of my pocket?

02:42:02.160 --> 02:42:05.160
What were you doing? You're not nice.

02:42:05.160 --> 02:42:07.160
That was so funny.

02:42:07.160 --> 02:42:09.160
That was so funny.

02:42:11.160 --> 02:42:13.160
That was smooth and deadly.

02:42:17.160 --> 02:42:19.160
That was great.

02:42:19.160 --> 02:42:21.160
The chat room was...

02:42:21.160 --> 02:42:23.160
I reached...

02:42:23.160 --> 02:42:25.160
Rob had the pack of cigarettes sticking out of his pocket.

02:42:25.160 --> 02:42:27.160
I don't smoke. Smoking's bad for you, kids.

02:42:27.160 --> 02:42:29.160
So I grabbed it and put it behind my back

02:42:29.160 --> 02:42:31.160
and then Zero grabbed it and wobbled it and goes upstairs

02:42:31.160 --> 02:42:33.160
and Zero's in there and does the...

02:42:33.160 --> 02:42:43.600

you might get an answer

02:43:03.520 --> 02:43:05.360
but you might always like what you hear

02:43:05.360 --> 02:43:09.320
this segment was born from the fact that we've run out of things to talk about

02:43:09.320 --> 02:43:12.480
and so we rely on you, the audience, to

02:43:12.480 --> 02:43:17.120
uh... you know, kind of jumpstart the show again

02:43:17.120 --> 02:43:19.540
okay that wasn't a question

02:43:19.540 --> 02:43:21.220
i was excited

02:43:21.220 --> 02:43:22.940

02:43:22.940 --> 02:43:26.440

02:43:40.640 --> 02:43:42.720
impact

by the way you know they're like a couple of sixteen-year-old girls right

02:43:44.960 --> 02:43:49.400
here

02:43:49.400 --> 02:43:50.640
yeah

02:43:50.640 --> 02:43:56.600
I make them creamy. I have a question for you, Rob. What? Sometimes you just feel not so fresh.

02:43:56.600 --> 02:43:59.400
Yeah, right now.

02:43:59.400 --> 02:44:06.400
And he also wants to know, hey, what's that rash from? Dry rot.

02:44:07.560 --> 02:44:09.880
You know. Alright, dry rot.

02:44:09.880 --> 02:44:10.880
Moving on.

02:44:10.880 --> 02:44:13.920
EOSFBB has a question.

02:44:13.920 --> 02:44:18.480
Previously on Orange Lounge Radio, I recall somebody mentioning chocolate cool whip.

02:44:18.480 --> 02:44:22.320
However, when I went to my local supermarket, they didn't have it, and the Cool Whip website

02:44:22.320 --> 02:44:24.320
didn't have it either.

02:44:24.320 --> 02:44:26.780
Can you confirm the existence of Chocolate Cool Whip?

02:44:26.780 --> 02:44:34.260
I can indeed, because I used to buy it in my veal, but what I bought at Ralph's was

02:44:34.260 --> 02:44:38.960
Chocolate Ready Whip in the spray can, because you can get high off of it in three seconds.

02:44:38.960 --> 02:44:41.720
Okay, so Chocolate Ready Whip is what you can easily find out.

02:44:41.720 --> 02:44:46.480
Now I have seen Chocolate Cool Whip, except I don't know if it was Chocolate Cool Whip.

02:44:46.480 --> 02:44:48.080
I think it was Chocolate Generic Cool Whip.

02:44:48.080 --> 02:44:49.080
No, Choco Kool-Aid.

02:44:49.080 --> 02:44:50.080
Really?

02:44:50.080 --> 02:44:51.080
Okay.

02:44:51.080 --> 02:44:52.080
Interesting.

02:44:52.080 --> 02:44:53.080
And maybe just continue.

02:44:53.080 --> 02:44:54.080
This was a few years ago.

02:44:54.080 --> 02:44:55.080
I'd like to know what EOSFPB is going to be doing with Choco Kool-Aid.

02:44:55.080 --> 02:44:56.080
But I was just with it.

02:44:56.080 --> 02:44:57.080
I was making ice cream.

02:44:57.080 --> 02:45:01.080
I had the cream brulee in me before.

02:45:01.080 --> 02:45:02.080
Okay.

02:45:02.080 --> 02:45:03.080
Yeah.

02:45:03.080 --> 02:45:08.360
Also, EOSFPB asks, where can I find females to say something for my porno music I made?

02:45:08.360 --> 02:45:13.120
These things need to be said essentially through the word I've been using is orgasmically.

02:45:13.120 --> 02:45:18.120
Always, all that I've asked have declined mentioning that they were not whores.

02:45:18.120 --> 02:45:23.120
Offer to pay them money to say this word, and then they'll be like, okay.

02:45:23.120 --> 02:45:24.120
What's the word?

02:45:24.120 --> 02:45:25.120
My suggestion...

02:45:25.120 --> 02:45:26.120
What's the word?

02:45:26.120 --> 02:45:28.120
Orgasmically, I don't...

02:45:28.120 --> 02:45:29.120
I'd close the window.

02:45:29.120 --> 02:45:30.120
Orgasmically?

02:45:30.120 --> 02:45:31.120
I don't know.

02:45:31.120 --> 02:45:32.120
He just needs dirty phrases said.

02:45:32.120 --> 02:45:33.120
Look my...

02:45:33.120 --> 02:45:35.120
Oh, look my tongue.

02:45:35.120 --> 02:45:38.120
I would say, honestly, my suggestion, yahoo.

02:45:38.120 --> 02:45:40.120
There's tons of freaks on yahoo.

02:45:40.120 --> 02:45:42.120
Yahoo.

02:45:42.120 --> 02:45:44.960
Go to Yahoo. You'll find women that'll do anything.

02:45:44.960 --> 02:45:50.180
Take that money, rent some pornos, and rip audio from them.

02:45:50.180 --> 02:45:52.360
I know. This will work. Tell the...

02:45:52.360 --> 02:45:53.680
It's not boner, it's boner.

02:45:53.680 --> 02:45:56.800
No, I have the bonafide trick that'll work for you, OSFPB.

02:45:56.800 --> 02:46:00.520
Tell the women you're gay, because then they'll do anything for you.

02:46:00.520 --> 02:46:03.120
They really will.

02:46:03.120 --> 02:46:05.080
Then they'll never get a date again.

02:46:05.080 --> 02:46:06.520
But no, because then you go,

02:46:06.520 --> 02:46:15.280
Oh, gosh, you know, as much as I love, you know, anal sex and blowjobs, I really want to try a pussy someday, and then all the way I'm gonna go,

02:46:15.280 --> 02:46:17.120
Oh, me, me, me, I'll help you out!

02:46:18.120 --> 02:46:20.400
Really? I'll have to remember that if I ever become single again.

02:46:21.840 --> 02:46:26.400
Well, uh, you know, I'm, like, gay and all, but, uh, would you, like, uh, suck my cock?

02:46:26.960 --> 02:46:27.840
Would that work?

02:46:29.680 --> 02:46:32.720
I'll just pretend you're a guy. And, yeah.

02:46:34.360 --> 02:46:35.080
Good idea.

02:46:35.080 --> 02:46:36.280
Okay. Moving on.

02:46:36.280 --> 02:46:43.280
last week's orange round

02:47:06.280 --> 02:47:13.280
Q. How do you get hemorrhoids the size of melons?

02:47:13.280 --> 02:47:21.240
A. You get really constipated and then try to take a big shit. Eventually after having

02:47:21.240 --> 02:47:25.760
a whole life of nothing but bad constipation and trying to push your intestines out through

02:47:25.760 --> 02:47:31.040
your ass, you'll grow a hemorrhoid. Also work a desk job.

02:47:31.040 --> 02:47:43.040
I know this because I was looking up stuff on the internet, medical stuff, and I found

02:47:43.040 --> 02:47:44.040
hemorrhoid advice.

02:47:44.040 --> 02:47:45.040
Beautiful.

02:47:45.040 --> 02:47:50.520
Vidpowah asks, Will my American PlayStation 2 peripherals work on a Japanese PlayStation

02:47:50.520 --> 02:47:52.120
2 and vice versa?

02:47:52.120 --> 02:47:56.120
Will his American PlayStation 2 peripherals work on a Japanese PlayStation 2 and vice

02:47:56.120 --> 02:47:57.120
versa?

02:47:57.120 --> 02:47:58.120
Yes!

02:47:58.120 --> 02:47:59.120
God damn.

02:47:59.120 --> 02:48:04.120
Japanese Necron for years to play Wipeout on my American Playstation.

02:48:04.120 --> 02:48:05.120
So, yeah.

02:48:05.120 --> 02:48:08.120
And he also wants to know, do we yahoo?

02:48:08.120 --> 02:48:10.120
Actually, yes.

02:48:10.120 --> 02:48:15.120
I would like to say once again the email address if you ever want to send your comments or suggestions to OrangeLoungeRadio.

02:48:15.120 --> 02:48:16.120

02:48:16.120 --> 02:48:19.120
OrangeLoungeRadio at yahoo.com.

02:48:19.120 --> 02:48:22.120
Yahoo!

02:48:22.120 --> 02:48:26.120
23rd Magus wants to know, original or extra crispy?

02:48:26.120 --> 02:48:27.120
Original.

02:48:27.120 --> 02:48:33.080
extra crispy bitch I I would vote extra crispy as well sorry again if I get

02:48:33.080 --> 02:48:39.720
chicken I usually pull off skin off of it anyway bad that crap sweet it's

02:48:39.720 --> 02:48:49.240
nothing but flour and grease grease okay also 23 mangoes once has a specific

02:48:49.240 --> 02:48:53.600
question for Loki Loki what would you do with two quiet jap girls in a bucket of

02:48:53.600 --> 02:49:00.560
chocolate-ready whip. I don't like chocolate-ready whip. No, if we're talking regular-ready whip,

02:49:00.560 --> 02:49:06.560
that's a whole different story. I would have them perform a wonderful little syrup tease

02:49:06.560 --> 02:49:19.960
while I eat ice cream. It's two things I enjoy, syrup teases and ice cream. Oh, my God, Rob,

02:49:19.960 --> 02:49:21.880
You're matching your shirt.

02:49:21.880 --> 02:49:25.560
Rob's wearing this lovely red shirt that says I hate myself and I want to die.

02:49:25.560 --> 02:49:27.960
And he's matching it now.

02:49:27.960 --> 02:49:32.000
It's my Nikkari shirt. You're glowing.

02:49:32.000 --> 02:49:35.940
That was quite possibly the funniest thing that's ever been said on this program,

02:49:35.940 --> 02:49:37.120
in my opinion.

02:49:37.120 --> 02:49:38.760
I would watch guys do that.

02:49:38.760 --> 02:49:40.480
Okay.

02:49:40.480 --> 02:49:41.920
Okay, now low-key.

02:49:41.920 --> 02:49:43.960
Twenty-three Maggots has another question.

02:49:43.960 --> 02:49:45.720
I do want to know, why don't they

02:49:45.720 --> 02:49:48.500
serve ice cream in a fucking strip club?

02:49:48.500 --> 02:49:54.500
Why don't they? Okay, let's open up a strip club, and it'll be ice cream and boobs.

02:49:54.500 --> 02:49:59.500
I want ice cream and dick.

02:49:59.500 --> 02:50:02.500
And on Wednesday could be like banana split night where we have the male strippers.

02:50:02.500 --> 02:50:05.500
And they deserve spotted dick.

02:50:05.500 --> 02:50:07.500
What? It's a British delicacy.

02:50:07.500 --> 02:50:11.500
I want to make phallic sundaes.

02:50:11.500 --> 02:50:16.500
I want to come up with desserts that look like, you know, anatomy.

02:50:16.500 --> 02:50:30.500
No, seriously, it's very interesting. They serve, like, okay, they serve, like, you know, basically appetizer food and burgers and stuff at, like, you know, strip clubs. But ice cream, I mean, you gotta, you gotta have, like, dessert. Seriously.

02:50:30.500 --> 02:50:32.500
I'm pretty sure they have good, pretty good ice cream.

02:50:32.500 --> 02:50:41.500
I don't know, man. It's just, like, they serve all this greasy food and you feel sick to your stomach. You want something, like, comforting, like ice cream.

02:50:41.500 --> 02:50:43.500
Okay, anyways, what's the other question?

02:50:43.500 --> 02:50:47.500
The other question is, what would Rob do with two quiet jab girls and a bucket of chocolate ready whip?

02:50:47.500 --> 02:50:49.500
But he's asking you what I would do.

02:50:49.500 --> 02:50:52.500
What you would do? I don't know.

02:50:52.500 --> 02:50:55.500
You'd send the girls over to Matt's house and, uh...

02:50:55.500 --> 02:50:57.500
I know what Rob would do.

02:50:57.500 --> 02:50:59.500
I know what Rob would do.

02:50:59.500 --> 02:51:03.500
He would just have them stand there with their boobs out and eat the ice cream.

02:51:03.500 --> 02:51:05.500
Because Rob likes boobs.

02:51:05.500 --> 02:51:07.500
Are you kidding? I'd have him clean my house.

02:51:07.500 --> 02:51:12.500
I need some topless maids shit.

02:51:12.500 --> 02:51:13.500
Alright.

02:51:13.500 --> 02:51:14.500
Okay, that's sweet.

02:51:14.500 --> 02:51:17.500
Boobs are cute.

02:51:17.500 --> 02:51:19.500
Uh, okay.

02:51:19.500 --> 02:51:23.500
DarkTetsuya wants to know, you think the arcade would be a good place to find a girl?

02:51:23.500 --> 02:51:25.500
Try the internet.

02:51:25.500 --> 02:51:33.500
Actually, I met a guy who I dated for about a month when I worked in an arcade.

02:51:33.500 --> 02:51:39.500
I should let you finish your story, but anyways, I was gonna say, meet women where you like to be.

02:51:39.500 --> 02:51:43.500
I mean, basically, like, say for instance you're in the arcades or that kind of stuff where you're into this.

02:51:43.500 --> 02:51:47.500
You'll find people that are into the same kind of stuff in those places, you know?

02:51:47.500 --> 02:51:49.500
Just not home. Don't meet women at home.

02:51:49.500 --> 02:51:51.500
Yeah, don't meet women at home.

02:51:51.500 --> 02:51:52.500
Even if you like to be home, don't meet women at home.

02:51:52.500 --> 02:51:55.500
Online is sort of okay, because nowadays you can kind of find out-

02:51:55.500 --> 02:51:59.500
I met Dan, and we're celebrating our five-year anniversary this Friday.

02:51:59.500 --> 02:52:04.500
But no, if online's alright, it's just risky.

02:52:04.500 --> 02:52:06.500
Online's risky. Jamie took up the gamble and she won.

02:52:06.500 --> 02:52:18.500
Online's kinda risky. Now if you happen to be within, say, the 18 to 21 year old range, I happen to know, because I was looking for my friend Sean.

02:52:18.500 --> 02:52:27.500
On Yahoo, the personals, man, there's some crazy people out there. There's some women that are damn hot and they're wanting people to go out with them.

02:52:27.500 --> 02:52:31.240
out with them except for the one chick because she was her best friends were

02:52:31.240 --> 02:52:36.580
her parents but she was hot so I feel like I'd overlook that just for that

02:52:36.580 --> 02:52:44.460
seriously get a college Oh college college college yeah

02:52:44.900 --> 02:52:49.380
okay next question that's good good advice good scene of us find women where

02:52:49.380 --> 02:52:53.300
you like to be angel says just a side question really did you ever find the

02:52:53.300 --> 02:52:56.300
No, we didn't. I didn't even think to look for it this week.

02:52:56.300 --> 02:53:01.300
I'm going to be cleaning up this room pretty good the next couple of days because I promised Brian I would.

02:53:01.300 --> 02:53:02.300
Yeah, shut up.

02:53:02.300 --> 02:53:03.300
So, we'll see if we find it.

02:53:03.300 --> 02:53:05.300
But no, we haven't found it yet. Amazingly enough.

02:53:05.300 --> 02:53:07.300
You guys have Game Boy games for Rob Stewart.

02:53:07.300 --> 02:53:08.300
And the tape.

02:53:08.300 --> 02:53:10.300
The games aren't actually in there, it's just the boxes.

02:53:10.300 --> 02:53:11.300
And whatever this is.

02:53:11.300 --> 02:53:15.300
It's conversion for the mouse. Anyway, moving on.

02:53:15.300 --> 02:53:18.300
Let's see what's in Rob's drawers.

02:53:18.300 --> 02:53:19.300
No.

02:53:19.300 --> 02:53:25.300
More Than Jake wants to know. I'm not going to tell the dead baby joke. That was so two weeks ago.

02:53:25.300 --> 02:53:27.300
What would you do for a Klondike bar?

02:53:27.300 --> 02:53:30.300
Go to the store and buy one.

02:53:30.300 --> 02:53:33.300
I know. Go to the store and put a dollar on the counter and say, give me a Klondike bar.

02:53:33.300 --> 02:53:38.300
I know you've got a Klondike bar and nice titties.

02:53:38.300 --> 02:53:41.300
Do you have sex with a very fine Asian woman?

02:53:41.300 --> 02:53:57.300
Didiarchoholic wants to know boxers or briefs?

02:53:57.300 --> 02:53:58.300
We'll start with Jamie.

02:53:58.300 --> 02:54:01.300
What do you like to wear?

02:54:01.300 --> 02:54:03.300
I'm just kidding.

02:54:03.300 --> 02:54:05.300
Nothing.

02:54:05.300 --> 02:54:08.300
I don't know, I like, I like...

02:54:08.300 --> 02:54:10.300
That's kind of a personal thing to say with the answers.

02:54:10.300 --> 02:54:11.300
Yeah, okay, so...

02:54:11.300 --> 02:54:16.300
I would say in general, I prefer briefs on the guy, because they show more.

02:54:16.300 --> 02:54:19.300
Oh, the boxers need more accessibility.

02:54:19.300 --> 02:54:25.300
Oh, there was this one time where my friend's boyfriend was asleep in her bed in her dorm room,

02:54:25.300 --> 02:54:30.300
and I was walking, I turned back to say something to her, and his slide was totally open.

02:54:30.300 --> 02:54:33.300
I was like, you need to leave him because he stung people inside the car.

02:54:33.300 --> 02:54:35.300
Oh my god!

02:54:35.300 --> 02:54:37.300
I used to go in their dorm room and sniff the air.

02:54:37.300 --> 02:54:40.300
And I was like, oh, you just got done, I'm going out now.

02:54:45.300 --> 02:54:51.300
No, I would go in and say hi, because I would just go over there and hang out.

02:54:51.300 --> 02:54:54.300
But if it had that particular smell, it would be like...

02:54:55.300 --> 02:54:56.300
This smells like humping.

02:54:56.300 --> 02:54:58.300
Moving on, who wants to go next?

02:55:26.300 --> 02:55:32.300
And, uh, my girlfriend looks hot in boxers, so, yeah.

02:55:32.300 --> 02:55:34.300
Actually, women look hot in boxes.

02:55:34.300 --> 02:55:35.300
Aww.

02:55:35.300 --> 02:55:39.300
Remember the 80s, though, when it was really popular for girls to wear men's boxers?

02:55:39.300 --> 02:55:43.300
It's so popular, man. Boxers in a short cut-off shirt? Oh yeah!

02:55:43.300 --> 02:55:48.300
I have to say, though, that getting an oversized pair of men's boxers are the most comfortable things to do.

02:55:48.300 --> 02:55:50.300
Really comfortable.

02:55:50.300 --> 02:55:52.300
Moving on?

02:55:52.300 --> 02:56:02.300
Okay, um, on me, I particularly like boxers, but on a girl, see, I'd have to flip it around and I would say a song. That's all I gotta say.

02:56:02.300 --> 02:56:04.300
Um...

02:56:04.300 --> 02:56:11.300
To that note, what's so good about walking around with a wedgie? Okay.

02:56:11.300 --> 02:56:15.300
As for me, neither.

02:56:15.300 --> 02:56:19.300
No, um, boxers get wedgies too easily.

02:56:19.300 --> 02:56:23.300
Or boxer briefs.

02:56:23.300 --> 02:56:27.300
I'll go ahead and speak for Dan because I'm sure he would say this.

02:56:27.300 --> 02:56:31.300
He wears briefs because he prefers to be pretty.

02:56:31.300 --> 02:56:35.300
Do they make these boxer briefs? Those are cool.

02:56:35.300 --> 02:56:39.300
Yep. Because you get the best of them.

02:56:39.300 --> 02:56:44.300
But as far as now women's underwear thing, thongs suck!

02:56:45.300 --> 02:56:51.300
Yeah, so I'm going to flip around the question and ask Dee Dee Archaholic, granny panties or thongs?

02:56:52.300 --> 02:56:55.300
But there is a wide variety of women's underwear.

02:56:55.300 --> 02:56:56.300
Yeah, I know, I know.

02:56:56.300 --> 02:57:02.300
See, for guys it's usually either or, but for women there are so many choices because, you know, we need more.

02:57:02.300 --> 02:57:04.300
We're complex.

02:57:04.300 --> 02:57:05.300
Alright, let's go on to the next question.

02:57:05.300 --> 02:57:12.300
go on the next question is buying underwear has to be a monumental decision

02:57:13.320 --> 02:57:14.320
all right moving on

02:57:14.320 --> 02:57:18.760
u s f e b do all women have bus sizes that are even numbers because i recall

02:57:18.760 --> 02:57:23.380
somebody mentioning that bras only come in even numbers

02:57:23.380 --> 02:57:27.660
this is funny cuz think back to the last question uh... like

02:57:27.660 --> 02:57:28.840
briefs only come in

02:57:28.840 --> 02:57:31.340
even numbers too and boxers and pants

02:57:31.340 --> 02:57:32.860
only come in even numbers as well.

02:57:32.860 --> 02:57:33.860
So the weight sizes are usually-

02:57:33.860 --> 02:57:34.860
Women, all right.

02:57:34.860 --> 02:57:35.860
Underwear.

02:57:35.860 --> 02:57:39.860
Underwear comes in single numbers, six, seven, eight, et cetera.

02:57:39.860 --> 02:57:41.860
Box sizes, though, are only in even numbers.

02:57:41.860 --> 02:57:44.540
The pants sizes are not only in even numbers.

02:57:44.540 --> 02:57:46.860
If they are juniors, they are in odd numbers.

02:57:46.860 --> 02:57:49.460
If they are misses, they come in even numbers.

02:57:49.460 --> 02:57:55.300
And boxers in briefs and stuff, they're normally 36 to 38 or something like that, so it's equal.

02:57:55.300 --> 02:57:57.020
Because they're lasting, right?

02:57:57.020 --> 02:57:58.020
Okay.

02:57:58.020 --> 02:58:01.020
But what about bras, bras specifically?

02:58:01.020 --> 02:58:02.020
I hate underwear.

02:58:02.020 --> 02:58:03.020
They're all even, right?

02:58:03.020 --> 02:58:04.020
They're all even.

02:58:04.020 --> 02:58:05.020
Okay, I want to know.

02:58:05.020 --> 02:58:06.020
No.

02:58:06.020 --> 02:58:08.020
Of course, you've got two.

02:58:08.020 --> 02:58:09.020
Hello?

02:58:09.020 --> 02:58:10.020
Brilliant deduction.

02:58:10.020 --> 02:58:11.020
Really a deduction.

02:58:11.020 --> 02:58:12.020
Bros are the best invention ever because every little bit of them is adjustable.

02:58:12.020 --> 02:58:13.020
Okay.

02:58:13.020 --> 02:58:14.020
Like, either you got...

02:58:14.020 --> 02:58:15.020
They only come in even.

02:58:15.020 --> 02:58:16.020
Either you got two or you got three.

02:58:16.020 --> 02:58:23.020
I want to know though why they have double D and not E.

02:58:23.020 --> 02:58:30.020
I want to know why they have double D and not E. But they do sell bra sizes up to G

02:58:34.140 --> 02:58:41.140
because I was watching Geraldo. And these women were on the show with these just humongous

02:58:41.140 --> 02:58:49.140
These women were on the show with these just humongous knockers and they had them, no, I mean they were like the size of watermelons.

02:58:49.140 --> 02:59:00.140
Yes. And they, you all need to see this, but no, they were novelty models and they were all, you know, normally sized bodies.

02:59:00.140 --> 02:59:06.140
Some of them were actually too small, but they had their breasts enlarged to this humongous size.

02:59:06.140 --> 02:59:10.140
They look like a bad Jojinchi.

02:59:10.140 --> 02:59:13.140
Okay, I don't understand with women getting that kind of thing.

02:59:13.140 --> 02:59:17.140
You know what, I don't understand, and I keep seeing these on stupid porno pop-up ads.

02:59:17.140 --> 02:59:23.140
What is up with the freaking, you know, monster cock thing, okay?

02:59:23.140 --> 02:59:28.140
Why do they Photoshop like, you know, zoomed in versions of cocks on these normal people?

02:59:28.140 --> 02:59:29.140
Because it looks stupid.

02:59:29.140 --> 02:59:45.140
They have the same thing with women getting these breast sizes that are like larger than D or double D and shit, like V or I don't even know how high it goes, but it's like you get more breast mass than you do actual women.

02:59:45.140 --> 02:59:56.140
I don't know, I started watching some of those talk shows for a while, and I think after a while they just start making up letters and numbers. I'm like a QQRJ3.

02:59:56.140 --> 02:59:57.140
Alright.

02:59:57.140 --> 03:00:02.460
Well, you know, there's one other thing, though, about that, down the line, those women are

03:00:02.460 --> 03:00:05.620
going to have some serious back problems.

03:00:05.620 --> 03:00:06.620
Serious back problems.

03:00:06.620 --> 03:00:07.620
Okay.

03:00:07.620 --> 03:00:10.100
They're going to be tripping over their own boobs when they're 80.

03:00:10.100 --> 03:00:13.700
Okay, I've got to get things moving here because we're almost to the end of the show.

03:00:13.700 --> 03:00:15.140
Three more questions, no more.

03:00:15.140 --> 03:00:16.140
Don't send us any more questions.

03:00:16.140 --> 03:00:17.340
We've got the last three right here.

03:00:17.340 --> 03:00:18.340
Here we go.

03:00:18.340 --> 03:00:21.580
Streso wants to know, hey, Jamie, how about ice cream on Dick?

03:00:21.580 --> 03:00:22.580
Too sticky.

03:00:22.580 --> 03:00:23.580
Alright.

03:00:23.580 --> 03:00:26.740
Vegas wants to know, is that your final answer?

03:00:26.740 --> 03:00:33.660
Is it me or does the ferret sound exactly like the demon duck child from QQQ?

03:00:33.660 --> 03:00:41.060
And lastly, Vidpowel wants to know, is Naoki really a female?

03:00:41.060 --> 03:00:48.460
I guess this is a good one, I'll let one more in because this is a good one to end things on. More than Jake, 543 wants to know, why?

03:00:48.460 --> 03:00:53.260
beautiful ice cream on a penis okay it's cold

03:00:53.260 --> 03:00:57.380
it doesn't like the way it doesn't like how about a hot fudge sundae

03:00:57.380 --> 03:00:59.860
that's fucking hot hello

03:00:59.860 --> 03:01:02.220
that's like pouring coffee on your dick

03:01:02.220 --> 03:01:04.080
the whole purpose of foreplay

03:01:04.080 --> 03:01:08.080
the whole purpose of foreplay, correct me if I'm wrong, is to get the dick hard

03:01:08.080 --> 03:01:10.100
so you can do the job

03:01:10.100 --> 03:01:12.260
it doesn't cold make it shrink? hello

03:01:12.260 --> 03:01:15.780
i want to know why would you need an excuse anyway? sweetie that works both ways though

03:01:15.780 --> 03:01:16.860
because you know you need

03:01:16.860 --> 03:01:20.940
to get the cock in the mmm haha you need to get the haha a little you need to get

03:01:20.940 --> 03:01:23.060
things going down there you know you know what i mean

03:01:23.060 --> 03:01:25.580
well yes i mean but i mean turn on the sprinklers

03:01:25.580 --> 03:01:28.860
i think that in terms of dick

03:01:28.860 --> 03:01:29.820
the purpose is

03:01:29.820 --> 03:01:31.820
and for a guy the purpose is to get

03:01:31.820 --> 03:01:34.220
the dick hard right

03:01:34.220 --> 03:01:36.060
it doesn't ice cream defeat that

03:01:36.060 --> 03:01:39.660
it seriously would unless you're going for rigor mortis

03:01:39.660 --> 03:01:43.140
things have changed since the last time i've had sex it's been a while so they might have changed

03:01:43.140 --> 03:01:44.820
things but last time

03:01:44.820 --> 03:01:46.740
i do remember those were the rules

03:01:46.740 --> 03:01:54.740
Last time I checked, I didn't bring in like a whole bunch of like condiments and fucking dessert items into the bedroom and shit.

03:01:54.740 --> 03:01:59.740
I mean, first of all, okay, let's just say, say you're getting up to that point where you're gonna put ice cream on the penis.

03:01:59.740 --> 03:02:03.740
You have the ice cream sitting there on the side of the bed or whatever, melting away, like dribbling all over.

03:02:03.740 --> 03:02:06.740
You know how much of a mess it's gonna make? Holy shit.

03:02:06.740 --> 03:02:09.740
I know, seriously. What if it's a flavor you don't like?

03:02:09.740 --> 03:02:12.740
I know, it's like your favorite flavor, and it's just melted on the floor. That's kind of pointless.

03:02:12.740 --> 03:02:17.400
Alright, it's time to wrap up the show, we're going way over, and the fortune cookie message

03:02:17.400 --> 03:02:21.420
is three and a half minutes tonight too, which doesn't help, so we're going for a record

03:02:21.420 --> 03:02:24.300
here, but that's okay.

03:02:24.300 --> 03:02:25.300
Final thoughts?

03:02:25.300 --> 03:02:26.300
Jamie?

03:02:26.300 --> 03:02:27.300
Don't put ice cream on Dick.

03:02:27.300 --> 03:02:28.300
Zero.

03:02:28.300 --> 03:02:29.300
What kind of propel do you like?

03:02:29.300 --> 03:02:30.300
I almost bought you some.

03:02:30.300 --> 03:02:31.300
Peach.

03:02:31.300 --> 03:02:32.300
Okay.

03:02:32.300 --> 03:02:33.300
Peach.

03:02:33.300 --> 03:02:34.300
Logie?

03:02:34.300 --> 03:02:41.040
The audience is way too young to be hearing this stuff, that's all I gotta say.

03:02:41.040 --> 03:02:45.320
My final thought is, the audience is horny.

03:02:45.320 --> 03:02:46.640
Thank you, good night.

03:02:46.640 --> 03:02:47.720

03:03:32.560 --> 03:03:35.760
app you're not going to be able to do that anymore this was not our decision

03:03:35.760 --> 03:03:39.880
this is something that live 365 is doing to all of their stations if you're

03:03:39.880 --> 03:03:43.480
afraid of signing up for registration because you're gonna get spam I suggest

03:03:43.480 --> 03:03:47.060
you sign up for a hotmail account just a dummy account and send it I I don't

03:03:47.060 --> 03:03:51.780
endorse spam at all but live 365 swears up and down they will not sell your

03:03:51.780 --> 03:03:56.600
email address to spammers yeah and zero zero says he hasn't gotten anything I

03:03:56.600 --> 03:04:00.120
don't get anything so I do believe it they're just wanting your age and that

03:04:00.120 --> 03:04:03.060
stuff so they can track hey 18 year olds like to listen to orange lounge radio or

03:04:03.060 --> 03:04:04.060
whatever.

03:04:04.060 --> 03:04:07.660
Gosh, we have a lot of 12-year-olds listening to this station, it talks about pornography.

03:04:07.660 --> 03:04:13.260
They won't sell your name, but here's what they'll do is they'll go ahead and give them

03:04:13.260 --> 03:04:17.620
to the companies and then have the companies leave the money in the normal drop spot.

03:04:17.620 --> 03:04:20.780
So please, you guys, stick with us even through the required logins.

03:04:20.780 --> 03:04:25.100

03:04:25.100 --> 03:04:28.980
to happen, so please bear with us and sign up now if you haven't already so you don't

And now, here's your fortune cookie message of the day.

03:05:28.820 --> 03:05:33.820
Some things in life are bad, they can really make you mad.

03:05:34.820 --> 03:05:37.820
Other things just make you swear and curse.

03:05:38.820 --> 03:05:43.820
When you're chewing on life's gristle, that grumble, give a whistle.

03:05:44.820 --> 03:05:48.820
And this'll help things turn out for the best.

03:05:48.820 --> 03:06:07.300
Always look on the bright side of life Always look on the light side of life

03:06:07.300 --> 03:06:11.380
If life seems jolly rotten, there's something you've forgotten

03:06:11.380 --> 03:06:17.620
And that's to dance, fun and dance and sing When you're feeling in the dumps, don't be

03:06:17.620 --> 03:06:22.620
Silly silly chums, just purse your lips and whistle, that's the thing

03:06:22.620 --> 03:06:28.620
Always look on the bright side of life

03:06:28.620 --> 03:06:30.620
Come on!

03:06:30.620 --> 03:06:38.620
Always look on the bright side of life

03:06:38.620 --> 03:06:42.620
More life is quite absurd, and death's the final word

03:06:42.620 --> 03:06:46.620
You must always face the curtain with a van

03:06:46.620 --> 03:06:50.620
Forget about your seat, give the audience a grin

03:06:50.620 --> 03:06:53.620
Enjoy it, it's your last chance anyhow

03:06:53.620 --> 03:06:59.620
Some who always look on the bright side of death

03:07:02.620 --> 03:07:07.620
Just before you draw your terminal breath

03:07:10.620 --> 03:07:14.620
Life's a piece of shit, when you look at it

03:07:14.620 --> 03:07:18.620
Life's a laugh and death's a joke, it's true

03:07:18.620 --> 03:07:22.620
You'll see it's all a show, keep on laughing as you go

03:07:22.620 --> 03:07:26.620
Just remember that the last laugh is on you

03:07:26.620 --> 03:07:32.620
And always look on the bright side of life

03:07:34.620 --> 03:07:40.620
Always look on the right side of life

03:07:40.620 --> 03:07:42.620
Come on Brian, cheer up!

03:07:43.080 --> 03:07:47.620
Always look on the right side of life

03:07:51.440 --> 03:07:55.540
Always look on the right side of life

03:07:56.020 --> 03:07:58.520
There's things happen at sea you know

03:07:59.260 --> 03:08:03.060
Always look on the right side of life

03:08:03.060 --> 03:08:05.300
What you got to do? Do you know how you come from nothing?

03:08:05.300 --> 03:08:08.260
You going back to nothing? What are you lost? Nothing!

03:08:08.260 --> 03:08:15.260
Nothing will come from nothing, you know what I say?

03:08:15.260 --> 03:08:16.260
Cheer up, you old bugger!

03:08:16.260 --> 03:08:17.260
Come on, give us a grin!

03:08:17.260 --> 03:08:18.260
There you are!

03:08:18.260 --> 03:08:19.260
See?

03:08:19.260 --> 03:08:20.260
In the film!

03:08:20.260 --> 03:08:21.260
Incidentally, this record's available in the foyer.

03:08:21.260 --> 03:08:22.260
So much for a little bit's role, you know.

03:08:22.260 --> 03:08:23.260
All right, it's a lot more.

03:08:23.260 --> 03:08:24.260
Let's get to play.

03:08:24.260 --> 03:08:27.260
I've done much more to live as well, you know.

03:08:28.260 --> 03:08:30.260
I thought I had some more.

03:08:30.260 --> 03:08:32.260
I stepped away from that.

03:08:33.260 --> 03:08:35.260
I think I'll try this mansion in three weeks.

03:08:37.260 --> 03:08:39.260
What do you think pays for those bubbles?

03:08:40.260 --> 03:08:42.260
They'll make the money back, don't they?

03:08:43.260 --> 03:08:45.260
I told them. I said to them.

03:08:45.260 --> 03:08:52.260
Thank you very much for listening, and we'll see you next week.
