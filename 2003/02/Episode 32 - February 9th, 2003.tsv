125465	126726	You know her as DarkSakura.
126986	129306	I've had lots of coffee, ha ha ha ha ha.
129446	133167	In that corner, say hello to our tack, tack, tack, our tack master.
134108	136568	I'm a tack, tack chick.
136629	137569	No, you're tack's bitch.
138029	139769	It's, uh, hello, our mics went off.
140330	141090	You're tack's bitch.
142690	144471	Rob, anything going off in your hands is natural.

153970	154190	Hug.
154611	156112	Also known as Matt.
156152	158474	We haven't come up with a stage name for Matt yet.
158614	159695	We don't want to use his real life.
160096	160716	He's the Matt.
161617	162298	He's the Matt.
162638	163198	He's just Matt.
163439	164219	He's like Cher.
164380	165380	Only one word.
165681	166461	Only one word name.
167282	167663	Yeah.
169938	174548	Also with us tonight, say hello, we've got tons of guests here with us tonight.
174889	177374	Say hello to Zero in the corner.
178823	180344	Hi, Zero, how are you doing?
183044	183404	My bad.
183665	184625	I went too far back in the intro.
185245	187146	Also, we've got... Wait, we'll do him last.
187466	190107	We've got Dave's back after a long time.
190187	191167	Hey, Scott, say hello.
192127	192407	Hello.
193768	195328	Scott's one of the Rocky Horror folks.

195828	197029	You brought back my TV, yes?
197509	198149	Good, thank you.
198269	199350	Now we can play Animal Crossing again.
199830	201070	He's eating nuts.
201370	202971	Also here, Brad.
207885	210313	Oh, EOSFBB has a great stage name for Matt.
210534	211938	His name could be Matt Comes A Lot.
214244	215024	How does he know?
216045	221046	I almost read that as come slut, but... Oops, my bad.
221286	233970	Oh, and also, way in the back corner, one of my bestest friends in the whole wide world who doesn't know shit about these DDR games, but that's why we love having people on this show that aren't really into these games.
234090	238011	They just sit here in horror at this... They do a radio thing on the internet these days?
238240	238920	Say hello to Billy!
239160	239800	Hello.
240741	241921	How are you, gentlemen?
242161	242801	Very good.
244042	245322	I kicked you in the foot.
247983	249003	I kicked you in the foot!
250123	250903	Not in the foot!
251343	252444	I kicked you in the balls!
253144	254044	Not in the balls!
256925	258005	Are you spitting the nut?
258925	260346	I'm spitting my nut.
261618	266240	We'll be talking to everybody more a little bit later, but first we're going to take a quick break.
267140	269120	And any other thoughts from the opening panel?
269160	271101	Will I tune something up?
271221	272662	Cue something up, I should say?
272682	273722	I'll play you some TAC.
274282	275062	Play you some TAC?
275343	280404	How about first we're going to do something from Dance Mania EX3.
280484	282265	Brand new Dance Mania album that just came out.
282285	283365	We're going to play something from that.
283605	284546	I'm sorry, EX2.
284626	285726	My bad, my bad, my bad.
285906	287707	I'll take the Rapist for 500.
287807	288427	We're going to play...
289821	292564	We're going to start this break off with Erotic, and then Tack.
292584	293485	We'll do Erotic, then Tack.
293505	293846	How's that?
294306	294547	Alright.
294867	295908	We're going to do Erotic.
295988	299272	This is Fred Come to Bed, the 2003 mix.
300233	302596	Word, and it sounds just like Max Don't Have Sex With You Guys.
302776	304138	Because all Erotic songs sound the same.
304158	305540	So we're going to play this.
305620	306641	Sorry, this doesn't sound like Erotic.
307335	309335	Because Charlene is actually missing heart.
310256	310416	Wait.
310436	311056	I found that out.
311796	313216	Does he have the flute part?
313296	313616	I don't know.
313656	314236	We'll find out.
314256	315196	Because that part kicks ass.
315316	316117	Okay, we're going to play it right now.
316137	318637	We're going to play Fred Come to Bed, then we're going to do something tack, and then we'll be back.
319337	320597	We are doing the match game tonight.
320637	321978	We're going to do it kind of early in the show.
322558	323858	Probably first or second segment.
323878	329179	When we come back, actually, we want to talk about the pre-show and something, a new contest we're going to do that relates to the pre-show we did tonight.
329279	329799	And porn.
330219	332319	And porn, of course, because we are Orange Lounge Radio.
332339	334420	But we'll be right back.
334460	335200	Thanks for tuning in.
338417	338978	Thanks for watching!
470738	476925	Come to bed, cause my max had sex with a sexy ex-old friend
661155	670119	And now it's time for Erotic Pop Idol, where we will find the next singer for everyone's favorite perverse Bomani band, Erotic.
670559	671479	Do it all night.
671720	672580	Do it with me.
673040	674461	No, no, that was awful.
674541	675421	Bloody terrible.
675461	676802	Do you take vocal lessons?
676882	677862	Kill your teacher.
678362	679363	In the heat of the night.
679823	682064	Oh, God, I think my ears are bleeding.
683244	683905	I liked it.
684425	685966	Shut the bloody hell up, Paula.
686086	686506	Next.
689623	690863	Um, that was cool.
692263	694044	Do you even know why you're here?
694124	695804	That was just bloody pathetic.
695884	696344	Next!
697745	700766	Come on, do it with me.
701706	702966	Yes, yes, that's it!
703326	704487	We have a winner!
705287	709148	A Star is Born, here on Orange Lounge Radio.
709750	712156	A star is born here on Orange Lounge Radio.
712176	713278	You say that every fucking time.
713318	714722	I know, that's why I have to say it.
714962	716386	Because Dave pointed that out one day.
716426	718931	You say that every goddamn time you play at Provo!
719952	721194	I didn't say it in that tone though
741156	741996	Everybody watch the American Idol.
742036	742677	Okay, we're going to start.
742697	744658	We need our funky 70s porn music.
744678	749800	We're going to start off with the match game first thing here tonight, but we're going to need to get some contestants.
749840	755222	So the trivia question we're asking tonight to get some contestants for the match game.
755262	757303	You got something that people will get pretty easy.
757643	758024	Okay.
759544	761425	First two people to private message me the answer.
761785	764306	I'm known in the chat room tonight as Sky Chat Room Slut.
765087	766287	Okay, this is a question.
766707	768088	It's actually a trivia question about myself.
769923	773825	What is the one beverage... No, I can't do that.
773885	774105	Okay.
777126	779607	First two people with the correct answer are our contestants tonight.
779627	781208	What is Jamie's favorite tax song?
782643	784104	Ooh, that's going to be a hard one, don't you think?
784885	785985	If they pay attention, you think?
786005	786946	If they pay attention, I'll get it.
786966	789668	Alright, Jamie's favorite tax song.
790148	791949	Send it to me over private message.
793150	796172	And the first two people who got it right get to participate tonight.
796252	800735	So, in the meantime, while we wait for those answers to come in, what do we want to talk about?
800975	803516	Oh yes, let's talk about the contest.
803697	803937	Yes.
804177	806378	First of all, what inspired the pre-show that we did tonight?
806698	807399	I ran out of ideas.
809276	813339	So, for those that just joined us and missed the pre-show, tell us what we did tonight.
814120	815321	Old TV show theme songs.
815821	816962	Old TV show theme songs.
817062	819724	Many of which were donated by DDR Angel and Stresa.
819844	821206	Next week you should play Eurobeat.
821786	822567	Yes, I will.
822907	823688	Eurobeat.
824468	824648	Oh!
824688	825209	Beat, beat.
825649	826710	Not the song.
826970	828511	I'll just play the whole Parapara soundtrack.
828531	829012	How's that sound?
829032	834836	Like all music from Initial D. Okay, I lost all 17 of my Initial D soundtracks.
834896	837278	Okay, next time Jamie takes a week off, you can do pre-show.
837739	838199	How's that, Matt?
839147	840150	Am I going to take a week off?
841072	843699	Thank you.
843920	845504	No, next week's pre-show is Strong Bad Things.
847589	849511	Okay, so let me think.
850291	850552	What else?
850612	851653	Oh yes, the contest.
851893	853154	So, great idea.
853214	856417	We have to give thanks to Dark Tetsuya for this idea.
856457	857258	This is a great idea.
858359	861842	Orange Lounge Radio is going to be hosting our own DWI contest.
861882	863503	Because we're going to do this right, goddammit.
863523	865705	We're going to do a DWI contest and it's going to kick ass.
866806	873352	And the theme is, you have to do a DWI complete with backgrounds, basic trick and maniac steps,
874620	879883	and banners, the whole nine yards, to any old TV theme.
879963	882344	Or actually, no, any TV theme you want to do.
882805	883745	Two minutes at the most.
883965	885586	If it's longer than two minutes, you better crop it down.
886247	887247	Any TV theme.
887427	889568	You want to do a DWI too, send that in.
889989	893050	And the winner's going to get, can we get a prize pack for the winner, Loki, you think?
893871	894411	Sure.
894471	895312	Just a small one, maybe?
895532	896212	Something small, yeah.
896472	899274	Okay, so we're going to get a prize pack, one of Loki's infamous prize packs for the winner.
900908	902989	In case somebody is like, small, uh?
903349	906750	When Matt says small, it's really not small as you think.
907530	908370	Let me see, wait, let me see.
908530	910931	We've got EvilNauki2DX in the chatroom.
910951	911271	Let me see.
911591	915273	Would Calibimani.com be willing to host this contest with us?
915553	919254	So we can get some place to have the files and some more promotion here.
919614	920754	Oh, you've got your site too.
921014	922335	Well, okay, you're going to host RDDOS?
923795	924735	I still want more promotion.
924775	927076	Let's see if we can get Kali Bamani to go in on this with us.
927556	928536	A joint contest here.
929557	930017	More promotion.
930057	933078	But you will host all the DWI files on the new Leech from Loki site.
933098	935058	Yeah, my new Leech from Loki site.
935658	936759	Oh yeah, I need to finish that.
938159	939679	Okay, I get a yes.
940000	940820	Okay, so this is it.
941040	944181	The KaliBamani.com slash Orange Launch Radio DWI contest.
944301	945941	Must be TV theme song.
946661	947141	Deadline.
947262	948222	When do we want them done by?
948702	948822	Uh...
950467	955331	We need a tentative deadline right now so we can iron out all the rules and shit.
955991	960795	You need to iron out what the rules and stuff would be.
960975	966960	Okay, so we'll just tell everybody they're going to have to look on the forums for the information.
967380	968902	Okay, American, Canadian, or British.
969882	970123	So...
971724	972444	This is the deal.
972904	975185	We don't know how we want to submit these yet, but that's okay.
975245	978406	Just go work on them, and we'll have more details for you next week.
978966	984187	Next week's show, by the way, Jamie's going to be here, and Loki, you're going to be here too, yes, next week?
984547	984967	I will not.
985267	985507	I will.
985687	987088	I'm going to be in L.A.
987148	988108	at the Cyber Beat Tournament.
989568	990368	I'll set it all up.
990889	993309	I've already got a way where they can send the files to me.
993649	993809	Great.
994189	996550	So we'll set something up, and we'll have more information for you next week.
997535	1002439	And if anyone still remembers leachfromloki.tk, do not go there.
1002959	1007462	Because that is the most disturbing picture I've ever seen in my entire life.
1008123	1009303	Whatever, blah blah blah.
1009323	1010724	That was funny though.
1010864	1011325	Yeah, whatever.
1011665	1019030	Anyway, but the correct address for Loki's site is www.willddrforfood.net slash leachfromloki.
1020391	1021392	So, anyway.
1022253	1024174	So now you know, we're doing a DWI contest.
1024214	1026956	And the judges will be, of course, myself, Jamie, and Loki.
1029247	1031329	That's because we're cool.
1031369	1033330	We're cooler than everybody in the world!
1045260	1047562	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1075420	1075720	Halleck

1150467	1151548	Or so everybody thinks.

1175450	1177912	He's just cool, and he wears a hat that says hookups.
1178773	1181635	I don't know if he's like trying to mack and get some hookups.
1181875	1182936	Are you trying to get hookups?
1183076	1185498	It's like clothing.

1208763	1209364	Yeah, whatever.
1210825	1214108	And then Celebrity number 6 is the coolest person in the entire world.
1214148	1214529	That's me.
1215785	1217026	Fuck no!
1217867	1219609	All right, so six celebrities tonight.
1219950	1220891	Let's play a match game.
1220911	1224695	If you don't know how we play a Vamani match game, I'm going to ask a question.
1224855	1225416	And we're going to burp.
1225516	1226577	And there'll be a blanket.
1227118	1233966	And the contestants tonight, Black Lab and the OSFBB, will have to try to fill in that blanket.
1234146	1236208	And for every celebrity they match, they get a point.
1236268	1236709	Blanket.
1237665	1238146	Wonderful.
1239367	1241470	A few things you should know about the celebrities.
1241630	1247497	You already know myself, Jamie, and Loki pretty well if you listen to the show on a regular basis, which I know both Black Lab and EOSA TV do.
1247517	1247637	Billy?
1249514	1254456	Billy's played DDR a couple times, but he doesn't get it, this whole obsession.
1255236	1259798	But he's a big fag, so... And he loves Britney.
1259838	1262839	But wait, he doesn't live in the main hall of Rosen Village.
1263899	1269761	If anybody can guess his favorite DDR song, they get... nothing, but yes.
1270341	1271722	Zero, I don't know.
1271802	1273242	Zero's kind of a wild card.
1273282	1274803	What will your answers be like, Zero?
1275939	1277720	I don't know, they'll just be whatever they look like.
1278060	1279820	They'll be the right ones, okay.
1281641	1285662	And then Brad and Dave are both very crazy, so their answers will be crazy.
1287363	1288703	They're crazy people!
1290704	1292544	Alright, first question.

1300856	1303258	Love to make fun of people that play DDR.
1303278	1304159	I'm going to spell Terrorizer.
1304579	1304839	Shh.
1305539	1306140	They don't know that.
1306200	1306680	It's radio.

1316767	1317267	It doesn't matter.
1319168	1319929	Can I ask a question?
1320530	1323612	Ted the Terrorizer loved to make fun of people that played DDR.
1324233	1330499	He liked to yell to the goofy people stomping on the game, Hey, stop stomping on the arrows and go blank!
1333988	1334248	Oh, hi!
1334268	1334649	How about you?
1334669	1336190	The answer should be in here.
1336230	1337190	Just pick something.
1358990	1360131	Don't say it, write it down.

1378429	1379609	Okay, do you guys have one?
1380050	1381070	Alright, great, we're ready.
1381851	1384132	I have both the contestants locked in too.
1385072	1386553	And I had Stressa send me something.
1386573	1387394	Did he send me an answer?
1387934	1389535	Stressa, you're not a contestant, I'm sorry.
1390475	1391336	Although that was a good answer.
1391696	1392537	Okay, let's see, here we go.
1393357	1399661	Black Lab said, Stop stomping on the arrows and go get laid.

1402909	1403450	Lovely.
1404010	1408513	EOSFBB said, Stop stomping on the arrows and go watch porn.

1438020	1449065	Well, go... Okay, she had my answer, so, um... Let's see, uh... Go eat baby fetus.
1451605	1454267	Go eat baby fetus, I'm sorry, that's not a match.
1454287	1456088	You mean that the baby itself is pregnant and has a fetus?
1457809	1459550	Yeah, well, there's... yeah, whatever.
1459730	1462031	I had fuck me in the ass, but, yeah, alright.

1480611	1481312	Nobody guessed that.
1482152	1482473	All right.

1502250	1502851	My answer...
1506488	1510680	My answer, hey, stop stomping on the arrows and go shove a bottle of Propel up your ass.
1516486	1517627	That's a very good observation, Brad.
1517647	1519428	They all have to do with penetration of some sort.
1519448	1521530	Not necessarily.
1522330	1523511	Billy's is implied, though.
1524552	1526714	Just because you're gay, you don't have to fuck me.
1526734	1527555	Yeah, that's right.
1527575	1530777	Just because you're gay doesn't mean you have to fuck people in the ass.
1530797	1532939	Yeah, I think that you can be gay and not a slut.
1538604	1538884	Alright.

2039398	2040899	Lemon-flavored is ass-flavored.
2042179	2044060	Yes.
2044260	2044660	Okay.
2044700	2045020	Here we go.
2045080	2045300	Let's see.
2045340	2046441	So, Jamie, you are going to go first.
2046761	2048902	And this would be the correct answer, hypothetically.
2050362	2054704	As much as I enjoy the thought of tax-flavored Pocari Sweat, my answer is Pocari Sweat.
2055444	2056985	Ah, Pocari Sweat-flavored.
2057065	2057545	Okay.
2057785	2058405	Good, good.
2058685	2062527	Which, you know, is actually going to be mentioned in my puppy of the week later on.
2062607	2063567	Oh, okay.
2064107	2064828	All right, moving on.
2065008	2065328	Loki.
2067013	2074957	Well, see, I had Blood of a Virgin on there as a flavor, but I'm just going to go with Vanilla Coke flavor.
2075397	2080499	I'm sorry, Blood of a Virgin wouldn't be good because I don't want to do that next time.
2080859	2085481	All right, so we had Vanilla Coke flavor.
2085521	2086562	Not a bad answer, not a bad answer.
2087042	2087562	All right, Billy.
2088022	2089603	Cream of some young guy.
2089623	2091264	Cream of some young guy flavor.
2092284	2093785	Good answer, but not a match, sorry.
2094506	2094886	Alright.
2095607	2096127	Zero.
2096327	2097728	Sadly enough, I did write ass.
2100470	2100711	Wait.
2101291	2105494	Wait, did Billy say some young guy or some... Oh, I thought it was like some young guy.
2105815	2107796	It's like, is that some Japanese food or something?
2109197	2111499	No, I just... No, I have seen it.
2111599	2113641	I just... I didn't comprehend it.
2113661	2113941	Answer!
2114521	2114762	Okay.
2116058	2117019	I want to say what?
2117079	2117819	I want to say what?
2118420	2119100	I speak just as well.
2119140	2120381	What?
2120441	2121061	What?
2121181	2122202	I speak just as well.
2123183	2123623	Exactly.
2124163	2124884	Okay.
2125564	2127365	Ours was okra flavored.
2129727	2130087	Mmm.
2130767	2131248	Okra.
2131648	2133189	Like gumbo.
2133389	2133709	Okay.
2134310	2140173	And my answer, because I guess that Jamie ate a lot of it when she was younger and maybe she wanted to relive her youth, I put paste flavored.
2141034	2142235	I never ate paste flavored.
2143872	2148194	Although, what I would do is I would take school glue and pour it on my hand.
2148895	2152097	And then when it dries, it dries clear.
2152557	2154258	And then I would go up to people and peel it back.
2154318	2155278	Oh my god, my skin!
2155639	2155799	Ah!
2156319	2159341	Okay.
2159561	2160141	Or paper.
2160221	2160541	Alright.
2164443	2165985	So, we had a point.
2166065	2167205	We did get finally one point.
2167606	2169787	So, EOSFBB takes the lead by one point.
2170167	2170488	Alright.
2172629	2173070	Okay.
2174250	2176352	It's not about being right, it's about being funny.
2176532	2178994	Okay.
2180255	2180935	Alright, here we go.
2181535	2182076	Next question.
2182116	2182596	Two more left.
2182616	2183577	We've got a five question game.
2184658	2190562	Billy the Big Homosexual loved to play gay Bomani songs.
2191380	2216799	He really wished that they would put blank into DDR Billy the Big Homosexual loved to play Gabe Imani songs He really wished that they would put blank into DDR I have mine Just fill in the blank with whatever you want
2217771	2220753	Billy the Big Homosexual loved to play Gabe Imani songs.
2220813	2222974	He really wished they would put blank in the DDR.
2226656	2227016	I'm kidding.
2228837	2229898	I didn't say it was you.
2230358	2231359	How many people are named Billy?
2231379	2233060	Are you insinuating something?
2235981	2236842	Is everybody locked in?
2238022	2239103	Yes, is Billy locked in?
2241772	2243033	Okay, answer.
2243553	2245113	Okay, both our contestants are locked in.
2245133	2245513	Here we go.
2245873	2246693	Are you guys locked in?
2246733	2247273	Dynamic Duo?
2247353	2247994	Okay.
2249794	2250234	Here we go.
2250774	2251294	What's that name?
2251334	2251954	It's Robin.
2252275	2258236	Black Lab says, I really wish that they would put some lamb into DDR.
2261336	2261857	Lamb.
2261877	2263057	Oh, good answer, but no.
2264811	2265191	We'll see.
2265511	2265651	Oh!
2267152	2272614	The OSFBB says, I really wish that they would put some bars that rape you back into DDR.
2276615	2277356	That's a good one.
2277976	2279517	Alright, let's see if there's any matches.
2280017	2280397	Jamie.
2281269	2284030	Billy really wishes that they would put... Back That Ass Up.
2284210	2286031	Back That Ass Up in the DDR.
2286151	2287372	No, not a match, but a good answer.
2287952	2288272	Loki.
2288793	2290413	From last week, Temple of Butt.
2290593	2291554	Temple of Butt!
2293455	2294195	Billy's all, ooh!
2296476	2299878	Okay, Billy, now this would be the correct answer, supposedly, in a perfect world.
2300058	2301178	Billy, what should they do?
2301198	2302479	Insert any Kylie song here.
2304415	2307416	If you knew Billie, you knew just go with Kylie Minogue.
2307436	2308016	That's all you had to do.
2308056	2308977	Now, this is the funny thing.
2309457	2313719	Kylie Minogue shows up on all those Dance Mania albums, but they have not put her in DDR yet.
2315319	2315539	What?
2316820	2325143	Dancing States Party Edition, remember, had... The British version, the British home version, had Can't Get You Out of My Head On It.
2328316	2330158	Billy Says, which goes to show it's America's Awesome.
2330498	2330818	Okay.
2332280	2332640	Zero.
2332880	2337305	I really wish they'd put Naoki Naked.
2340187	2340668	That's good.
2341168	2341549	Alright.
2344311	2345933	Okay, let's move on.
2347903	2348724	Sorry, I'm just checking.
2349145	2351147	I know, I'm just... Dynamic Duo.
2351427	2353009	I'm sorry, I was just closing private message rooms.
2353189	2357674	Yes, Dynamic Duo says, Billy wishes they would put some... Dolphin Cry.
2357694	2358474	Dolphin Cry.
2361177	2362499	It's a sexual position, isn't it?
2362519	2363720	Yes, Dynamic Duo is a good one.
2374224	2375626	Okay, I said, um...
2385746	2388928	My answer was Billy the Big Homosexual loved to play Gabe Imani songs.
2388988	2394172	He really wished they would put more Para songs into DR. Yay, you're a B!
2395953	2397814	More Parabar songs, unfortunately.
2398475	2399635	Not a match.
2400516	2401717	Shine loose to both our contestants.
2401737	2403138	The OSFBB is still up by one.
2403498	2405439	Black Lab, this is your last chance to catch up.
2405479	2405940	Here we go.
2409302	2412004	Oh, we had a request to hear the dolphin cry one more time.
2415421	2415821	Come on.
2418523	2419843	They call him Flipper.
2421364	2421945	All right, thank you.
2422485	2423185	Okay, here we go.
2426387	2427548	All right, last question.
2427568	2427968	Here we go.
2428068	2432390	Last chance to catch up, Black Lab.
2434091	2440335	We predict on next week's drunk show, Jamie is going to get so drunk that she ends up blank.
2445413	2450736	We predict on next week's drunk show, Jamie is going to get so drunk that she ends up blank.
2450876	2451936	I have it.
2452056	2452717	I have it.
2476043	2477424	La la la, I'm still thinking.
2477444	2479404	Why did I put this question in there?
2479424	2480565	This is a hard one.
2491508	2491849	Rob.
2491869	2491949	Rob.
2491989	2492289	What?
2492329	2492669	Rob.
2492730	2493210	Rob.
2493250	2493350	Hi.
2493671	2493851	Hi.
2493991	2494431	Alright.
2494572	2497815	Oh, the contestants aren't locked in yet.
2497835	2499377	They still haven't sent.
2514890	2518191	We predict on next week's Drunk Show, Jamie's going to get so drunk that she ends up blank.
2518211	2519192	We're waiting on the contestants.
2519232	2520152	All the celebrities are in?
2520792	2521072	All right.
2521592	2522813	We're just waiting for the two contestants.
2523333	2524053	Any day now, you two.
2525154	2525514	One's in.
2529695	2530936	Waiting on one more contestant.
2533277	2535397	Are you waving your Raybar light around?
2537058	2539119	I wonder if we're getting a big long paragraph or something.
2541604	2548066	Jamie knows it's all in good fun, but she reserves the right to cut you.
2548366	2549106	Alright, here we go.
2550147	2550527	Here we go.
2551607	2553488	We'll start off with the person in the lead.
2553528	2559990	We predict on next week's Drunk Show, EOSFVB says Jamie is going to get so drunk that she ends up lesbian.
2562991	2563951	That got three blinks.
2566252	2571578	Black Lab says... Black Lab also says lesbian.
2571598	2574021	She's gonna get so drunk she ends up lesbian.
2576403	2578245	Is that because we all get gay when we drink?
2579727	2580868	Do I go straight when I drink?
2581509	2582350	Actually, I kinda do.
2584836	2590978	Okay, don't you people know that I already have made the vow that if Dan and I ever break up, I'm getting a girlfriend?
2591799	2594680	Because I hate men anyway, mostly.
2595440	2595800	Alright.
2599581	2602863	I just don't find anything about that as funny.
2603703	2604743	Because men love lesbians.
2604963	2605263	Alright.
2606924	2609465	Jamie's gonna get so drunk she... Ends up saying...
2610237	2611118	Ends up sane.
2611178	2612079	That's a good answer.
2612679	2613060	Alright.
2615022	2615822	Next up, Loki.
2615862	2619606	She ends up... Mine's always... Yeah.
2620206	2623169	I said... I said lesbian, dammit!
2624110	2625471	So they get a point each.
2625511	2626372	They get a point each.
2627373	2630135	Too bad it's... They answered the same thing.
2630255	2630556	Alright.
2633530	2635211	Billy, she ends up... Naked.
2635511	2635952	Naked.
2638533	2638974	Good answer.
2639034	2645638	Zero, she ends up... I thought I was going to be original with this, but lesbian is what I came up with.
2646159	2646859	Two points.
2647039	2647379	Alright.
2648280	2649161	Yeah, it's too easy.
2649201	2649961	It's the easy answer.
2650361	2651262	It's the cop-out answer.
2651342	2655005	Brad Dave put... Do the lead-in.
2656105	2661589	Jamie's going to get so drunk that she... Ends up... Ends up... Using the microphone.
2661849	2662590	Use your imagination.
2669571	2670251	Put out your hand.
2672912	2675574	I'm starting to hurt.
2676734	2680776	Now, mine's, amazingly enough, I think I have the most PG-rated answer.
2681756	2685818	Jamie's going to end up so drunk that she ends up making out with a Happy Bunny doll.
2688619	2689340	No, mine was.
2689400	2689960	I said same.
2690100	2690500	Oh, that's true.
2690520	2691080	You said same.
2691161	2692341	You had the G-rated answer.
2693021	2694322	I just kicked you.
2695282	2695602	All right.
2695703	2697643	So, the final scores.
2697723	2698624	Let's tally them up.
2699858	2701700	Black Lab has two points.
2702521	2705063	EOSFVB wins tonight with three points.
2705143	2705964	Congratulations.
2705984	2707005	You win a bottle of Propel.
2707485	2708567	You win nothing.
2709267	2711129	You win a bottle of Propel, but you have to go buy it yourself.
2711870	2712650	Okay, great.
2713732	2714192	Beautiful.
2715453	2717215	Thank you to all the stars.
2717255	2719557	This show was brought to you by Propel and Balls.
2719877	2721299	Somebody needs to come and bring me some balls.
2722320	2723121	No rave, please.
2724162	2724462	All right.
2725563	2729145	The light switch was installed so you could turn the light on and off.
2729745	2731306	Not so you could throw light switch rave.
2735908	2736328	All right.
2737009	2740511	So, I think we're going to go to another break.
2740631	2742011	I have to ask JB some questions.
2742071	2743192	JB sent me a remix.
2743252	2744052	No rave, please.
2744152	2744413	Thank you.
2745013	2746093	JB sent me a remix.
2747234	2748915	Is this one you did yourself, JB?
2748955	2749655	That's what I want to know.
2749895	2750676	Can you let me know that?
2751356	2752997	Because we're going to play that going into this next break.
2755294	2756535	CageMatch, we'll do what?
2756555	2757415	You want to do CageMatch next?
2757955	2758035	Sure.
2758055	2758875	We can do CageMatch in a little while.
2759856	2760116	Alright.
2760136	2760916	We'll do CageMatch next.
2761016	2762136	Okay, we'll do CageMatch next.
2763277	2764817	Okay, we're going to do CageMatch next when we come back.
2764837	2765638	We'll take a quick break.
2765658	2767318	I think we're just going to do a one-song break.
2768299	2771020	And I just want to know if this is... I already know that I'm going to win.
2771040	2773560	I just want to know if this is JB's own remix or not.
2773580	2774841	I already know that I'm going to win.
2774861	2775741	So that was a fun match game.
2775761	2776801	We haven't done a match game in a few weeks.
2776821	2778182	It's been about a month since we've done a match game.
2780251	2781892	Is there a topic for Listless yet?
2782092	2782892	I didn't win last time.
2783392	2785032	I don't know if we'll do Listless now.
2785072	2787033	We might take a week off from Listless.
2787053	2788954	Didn't I get dethroned by the cussing song last week?
2789254	2789554	The what?
2790014	2791134	Didn't the cussing song win last week?
2791154	2792374	No, the cussing song did not win last week.
2792394	2792755	I won, didn't I?
2792895	2795235	Remember, Jenny Bean had the tiebreaker vote.
2795415	2798216	Oh, you brought a cage match song and everything?
2798236	2798596	Yeah.
2798736	2799196	Oh, I'm sorry.
2799797	2801017	Well, I can dethrone it myself.
2805402	2805722	All right.
2806542	2809144	Well, we'll just play Jamie's song at some point during the show during another break.
2809164	2809924	And I'll pick a different song.
2810424	2810664	All right.
2812165	2813646	Okay, so... What do we just play during this break?
2814166	2815207	You just want to play your song?
2815547	2816167	Yeah, why not?
2816247	2816507	Okay.
2816827	2821010	Then we'll save, because I haven't gotten the answer on JB's mix if it was him or not, so I'll wait on that.
2821490	2823451	And in the meantime, we'll play... It's the song that Puppy sent me.
2823891	2824151	Okay.
2824491	2824971	So what is it?
2825012	2825832	Describe this for us, Jamie.
2827316	2828476	I don't think it needs any description.
2829177	2829597	Just play it.
2830238	2831438	No description needed, huh?
2831859	2832079	Yeah.
2832359	2832699	Alright.
2832779	2833560	It's just a cool song.
2834240	2837082	Okay, we're going to play this and we'll be right back.
2837122	2841845	We'll play this and another quick song and then we'll be back on Orange Lounge Radio with the Cage Match.
3093035	3101643	Hi-ho, Kermit the Frog here, informing you that today's broadcast of Orange Lounge Radio is brought to you by the letter B, the letter A, and the number 59.
3101723	3107668	Can you tell me how to get, how to get to Sesame Street?
3108228	3110370	We are back!
3110390	3114114	Oops, I accidentally had the repeat thing on.
3114514	3119078	Oh, we're just trying to recover from that Magic Game segment.
3119484	3120106	Billy left.
3120166	3121368	He says goodbye to everybody.
3121428	3124032	He had to go fuck somebody in the house.
3124072	3124353	I don't know.
3126777	3129442	So, we're back and we're chilling.
3130323	3130924	How are y'all doing?
3130944	3131345	How was your week?
3133203	3135264	I don't know what they're doing in the other room.
3135324	3136864	I hope my roommate's not trying to sleep, is he?
3137064	3137845	Okay, good, he's not.
3138945	3141486	My week was a big pile of ass.
3141846	3142306	Why, what happened?
3142507	3144947	No, I don't know, it was okay.
3145167	3149529	I got some hanging out and did lots of busy, rocky things.
3150650	3151930	I went costume hunting a bunch.
3152510	3153751	I still couldn't find a damn globe.
3154171	3155611	You know, we haven't done our fuck-yous.
3156732	3157572	We'll do the fuck-yous a little later.
3158052	3159373	We always do the fuck-yous towards the beginning.
3159413	3160573	I figure we'll save it towards the end.
3160593	3162174	And last night was just insane.
3164028	3168813	I think that I don't remember much of last night because I was not feeling happy.
3168993	3170234	Last night was crazy.
3170354	3171596	Yes, yes, definitely.
3172336	3173598	And you were fabulous.
3173898	3174258	Thank you.
3174779	3180184	For those that don't know, we're here in Orange Lounge World Radio headquarters in Sacramento, California.
3180244	3186731	A lot of us that are involved here with the show are also involved with the local production of Rocky Horror Picture Show, so we were doing that last night.
3187231	3188371	and that was a lot of energy.
3188431	3191752	So if we seem a little dead tonight, we're still kind of recovering from last night.
3192172	3198554	However, Jamie was kind enough to go to Walgreens and get some double shots drinks of those coffee things.
3198574	3199334	Starbucks double shots.
3199374	3199594	Yes.
3200155	3206136	So actually this episode of Orange Lodge Radio not only is brought to you by Propel and Ass.
3206176	3207377	Or Ass Flavor Propel.
3207657	3212018	It's brought to you by Starbucks double shot vehicle, you know, drink.
3212738	3212938	Yes.
3213778	3214699	Bitter Ass Coffee.
3215099	3216319	How was your week, Loki?
3217887	3219630	I went and played Cuser last night.
3220933	3222355	Oh, didn't you have a story about this?
3224018	3225962	You've got plenty of FUs besides this.
3225982	3226763	Come on, tell the story.
3227922	3230063	Yesterday was interesting.
3230083	3232784	Yeah, Zero went with me, so he can, you know, okay.
3233045	3233585	It was great.
3233985	3234645	It was good.
3235386	3240028	Vacaville, you know, it's really close, a lot closer than Concord or Pleasanton.
3240108	3240928	Stay away.
3241268	3241729	It was nice.
3242729	3246111	Now, the bowling alley, it's actually in Sars Entertainment.
3246511	3247751	It's like a bowling alley type place.
3247771	3251813	They've got, like, a nice restaurant in there and, like, pizza and an arcade and stuff.
3252254	3252674	Yeah.
3253474	3260503	I'm sure I'll go into this with my FUs later on, but they had Fifth Mix and Max 2 there, both in really poor condition.
3260623	3261164	Very poor.
3262566	3264849	Everything was broken there.
3264929	3268473	Even the soda machine was pretty much all randomized.
3268513	3270676	You'd pick one soda and get something else.
3271276	3273277	The soda machine was like roulette.
3273937	3275598	If you touched it, you didn't get what you wanted.
3276258	3281100	And then, um, now the Cusar was the worst run Cusar I've ever seen.
3282001	3286983	The arena was awesome, the packs were in good condition, but it was the worst run Cusar.
3287923	3288143	Ever.
3288303	3289824	And there was annoying people there.
3290564	3292865	Vacaville was full of hicks and wannabe gangstas.
3292905	3294346	Loki, what's a syringe?
3295547	3295827	Yes.
3296727	3297908	We'll go into that later.
3298368	3298788	But, uh,
3300449	3301210	It was interesting.
3301290	3305231	It became more fun later on when all the stupid people started leaving.
3305271	3305832	It sounded like ass.
3306912	3307212	Yeah.
3307572	3307993	Very much.
3308373	3315496	So that and the lack of sleep I've been doing the last few days because I've been going to bed at like 6 in the morning and getting like 3 hours of sleep.
3318703	3322065	As far as my week goes, I've been kind of getting ready for Rocky 2.
3322225	3322706	I've done a lot.
3322726	3324587	I went out and played Bomani, I think, one time this week.
3324607	3328049	I found that I'm suddenly, all of a sudden, I'm really into DDR Extreme.
3328069	3329610	Like, all of a sudden, I'm into DDR again.
3329930	3334413	And I think a lot of that has to do with Jamie on Lomi, her fifth mix, so I can make some link data.
3335113	3336754	So I can make some new link data for Extreme.
3337035	3338856	And now, like, I have something to accomplish.
3338916	3340977	Like, oh my gods, I've got to get a double A on this.
3341838	3344339	We need to re... I'm sorry, Jamie?
3344599	3346320	We need to set our night where we do nothing but DDR.
3346420	3347121	I'm looking at the audio.
3347651	3355195	We kind of used to do those on Friday night, but that physical... Well, we used to, way in the day, we did it on Wednesday night, but then I started going to karaoke, except I'm not even going anymore, so maybe we could just do Wednesdays again.
3355875	3356575	So, maybe that'll work.
3356656	3357976	I need to get a copy of Fifth.
3358056	3359897	I need to start making edits so bad.
3360157	3362498	I do fourth edits all the time, and they're getting kind of old now.
3362638	3364279	We can probably get you a copy of Fifth one way or another.
3364439	3368081	If Jamie lets me keep her copy a couple more days, I'll make you a copy.
3368101	3370182	I brought you, like, ten CDs to burn stuff on.
3370602	3370963	Cool!
3371943	3372723	Alright, whatever works.
3374064	3375345	We don't endorse pirating on this show.
3375385	3375685	No, we don't.
3377256	3378436	Actually, I'll be honest.
3380137	3380598	I'll be honest.
3380618	3382359	We never really talked about this on Orange Launch Radio.
3382379	3383799	Let me talk about my views on pirating games.
3384840	3387521	As far as DDR is concerned, and the money stuff.
3388742	3390643	Never the US ones, always the Japanese ones.
3391143	3393345	And I say it's okay, because I think...
3394225	3396686	The price you pay to import this stuff is just outrageous.
3396706	3397566	To import this stuff from Japan.
3397606	3400627	And honestly, if they wanted me to buy it, they'd release it in this country.
3400687	3407088	So I figure if they're not going to release it in this country, if they're not going to take that effort to satisfy our demand by releasing it here, then I'm going to pirate it.
3407568	3409509	But I have bought every U.S.
3409569	3410229	Bomani release.
3410389	3410869	Every one.
3411089	3415110	Even the very crappy first USA mix, I bought it just because I wanted to support Bomani.
3415170	3416410	And reserve them at GameStop.
3417731	3418671	The one at Arden Fair Mall.
3418731	3419311	Another plug.
3419511	3427275	Well, even still, I think it's kind of crap that you have to buy their shit that they release in order for them to hopefully bring out better stuff later on.
3427375	3428535	I think that's really stupid.
3428595	3431737	They did, but DDR Max was pretty good, you have to admit.
3432344	3435746	It was pretty good, but like, USA, the first one sucked ass.
3435966	3443950	Yeah, and I played it maybe twice, but I felt, okay, this is kind of the way I felt, I said, okay, I played all those Japanese ones for free, so I played all these songs for free.
3444010	3445911	But did you see the first one they released in Japan?
3445971	3446611	It was kind of bad.
3446631	3449152	Yeah, the one, well, but it had strictly business.
3449412	3453474	In comparison, though, to everything since, you know, you have to start somewhere.
3453814	3459077	I mean, this is an old, old debate that goes, you know, back about a year now.
3459377	3460938	Was that when USA was released, about a year ago?
3462436	3462898	More than that.
3463119	3465128	Yeah, that was a long time ago.
3465248	3467458	The Disney mix, the USA one, I played that one time.
3469087	3474369	I just don't even really play those songs, but I bought it just because I had played Disney's Rave a lot.
3474849	3480990	So it was kind of my conscience.
3481150	3484991	I think Somni Magus has my copy and doesn't realize it.
3485011	3488212	I have the Japanese version sitting right in front of the US one in my collection at home.
3489273	3491873	So I think I played it one time so I could get the maniac steps.
3491993	3495114	And I wanted to see how hard the ten-footers were, and then I was unimpressed.
3496395	3497715	Dance magic, enough said.
3498021	3499241	Yeah, it's all about dance magic.
3500742	3504943	So, um... Yeah, I say it's okay to pirate the Japanese ones.
3505243	3505963	Is this your yo-yo?
3506264	3506804	No, it's Brian's.
3507184	3508084	Brian's yo-yo sucks.
3508584	3508984	I'm sorry.
3509805	3510705	I'm gonna get you a yo-yo.
3511005	3512025	You can buy Brian a yo-yo.
3512045	3512825	I'll buy Brian a yo-yo.
3512906	3513186	Alright.
3514886	3517147	So... I want a yo-yo ball right now.
3518567	3520368	Do you want to talk Sim stuff?
3520628	3521128	Hey, Sim.
3522108	3523309	Okay, you want to talk about this?
3523389	3523649	Alright.
3524509	3525589	This was just announced this week.
3525629	3527530	Konami in Japan's making a brand new game.
3528956	3530517	It's called Aerobics Revolution.
3531857	3534318	Tell me it doesn't remind you of an old school 8-bit game.
3534338	3535078	It's Dance Aerobics.
3535118	3535558	Yes, it is.
3535618	3536359	It's Dance Aerobics.
3536419	3537639	I swear to God, it looks just like it.
3537979	3538800	With DDR steps.
3538820	3542641	But basically, it's going to be an aerobics game that uses your DDR mat.
3542681	3543321	You know what you love it?
3543341	3545082	And it looks like it has a little DDR sim mode.
3545302	3548083	They're kind of taking diet mode and making it its own game, I guess.
3548163	3548503	I don't know.
3549263	3550424	We don't really know much about this.
3552264	3553225	It looks like it's a home one.
3553545	3556326	Yeah, it's going to be a home release for PlayStation 2, and it's going to be out March 13th.
3557126	3557846	Jamie's getting this.
3558586	3566129	And it looks like it's going to follow the Shadow Dancers, kind of like a power mode, so it's probably got aerobics routines in it.
3567309	3567769	That looks cool.
3567789	3573130	And it'll probably keep track of how well you're doing by the feet.
3573471	3573991	And you know what?
3574491	3576871	Dance Aerobics was very similar, I thought.
3576972	3577492	So we'll see.
3577812	3578392	We'll compare.
3580394	3583537	When this aerobics revolution comes out, we'll see how similar it was to dance aerobics.
3583657	3585700	I did play dance aerobics one time back in the day.
3585740	3587642	I borrowed a power pad from my best friend in elementary school.
3587662	3588823	I have a power pad and I have dance aerobics.
3588863	3589103	Do you?
3589343	3591105	In track and field.
3591225	3591666	You know what?
3592407	3594489	On one week on Orange Lounge, we need to have a power pad night.
3594509	3596831	We need to have the power pad Olympics on Orange Lounge Radio.
3598328	3599188	I kicked your ass.
3599288	3600989	Okay, we're going to do that one night.
3601349	3604110	We'll get a crowd here and we'll move the show out into the other room.
3604130	3605170	We'll have the Power Pad Olympics.
3605190	3605690	How's that sound?
3605970	3606191	Okay.
3606331	3606831	Alright, cool.
3606931	3611272	It looks like that Dancerobics looks like he uses all the buttons, too.
3612633	3614673	All six?
3614813	3616314	It looks like there's almost one in the middle.
3616374	3618034	You see how this one has it lit up?
3618094	3620035	But I don't think there's a button on the... I don't think they would do that.
3620195	3621095	Yeah, I don't know.
3621135	3622736	Maybe it's just showing where your feet are supposed to be.
3622756	3623536	Maybe you're using one foot forward.
3623576	3623916	See that?
3623936	3625337	A lot of this is speculation.
3625397	3626037	Let's move to the chat room.
3626677	3631678	Yeah, we'll link the chatroom to this just in case you guys haven't heard about this yet and you want to look up the site like we're looking at right now.
3631738	3632058	There it is.
3632358	3635019	And if you're not in our chatroom, why the hell not?
3635099	3639579	Get over to our website, orangelounge.skie.cx and click on chatroom.
3642380	3644900	This game actually does look pretty interesting.
3645420	3647741	I'm definitely going to get it when it's out.
3648561	3650541	So, you might get a full review from me.
3650961	3651542	Alright, sounds good.
3651562	3653442	Whatever the fuck happened to Marshall B.?
3654978	3658420	Wasn't, okay, I've seen the Marshall Beat Machine once in Arcade Infinity.
3658440	3659561	They do have a home version of it.
3659981	3660862	Don't they have a home version of it?
3660882	3663063	They do, I played it just this week.
3664925	3665385	Pretty much.
3666226	3667887	It's, it's like, it's horrible.
3668387	3669908	It has sensors on your hands and legs.
3669948	3677353	There's a link to it, if you go, there's someone selling a bunch of them on eBay, and they'll send you to the Konami site where they actually talk about it.
3677453	3678534	It looks so retarded.
3679574	3681856	It's like you're fighting in Dance Beat.
3683795	3684536	It's interesting.
3685837	3691082	When Loki and I were at AI a couple weeks ago when we were off one week from the show, we were at Arcade Infinity.
3691662	3695346	We saw a Marshall Beat Machine and not a damn person playing it the whole night.
3696207	3698509	I thought I'd look like an idiot playing it.
3700447	3702627	There's actually two versions of it for the home now.
3702647	3705708	They have the first one, and I guess they just released the second one recently.
3725213	3728173	I think they made the sequel before they made the first one.
3728834	3729474	It was pretty bad.
3731014	3732515	That just sounds like utter ass.
3734735	3738857	Marshall Beat is missable, basically, is what we're all kind of coming to a consensus on.
3738977	3740437	Was there any songs that weren't in DDR?
3740997	3741778	Punch Mania.
3742218	3742758	Crap.
3744178	3745399	But Gun Mania is cool.
3746619	3747720	Gun Mania is cool.
3748440	3749060	Gun Mania is cool.
3749080	3750080	It's the pellet shooting game.
3751521	3752001	Gun Mania.
3753058	3754658	They had an AI, but it's always broken.
3755239	3757479	I made a joke that I was going to move in there and build a bed in there.
3757999	3758780	Because it's large enough.
3759100	3759680	It's huge.
3761280	3761580	Alright.
3764161	3765041	Moving right along.
3768522	3771603	We'll look into that after the show, what we're being told in the show right now.
3773503	3774464	What else is going on in DD World?
3774504	3775764	Is anything going on in SimWorld, Loki?
3778942	3780063	You want to talk about sim stuff, Loki?
3780723	3781984	Uh, okay, I guess.
3783285	3786227	Let's see, they've got another style 2003 still going on.
3786387	3788869	That's that other DWI contest thingy.
3791070	3796474	My site is coming up someday, so that'll be it.
3796514	3800896	But my site is releasing more of the DDR Extreme sim files.
3801557	3804379	You can find them with the backgrounds and all that wonderful stuff.
3804459	3806140	Are they still having Jesus Complex about it?
3806644	3807684	I don't know, I don't care anymore.
3808385	3819329	Um, they're also doing a full re-release on all the, uh, old, uh, official sim files, and they're doing them with, uh, CD, um, what was it, the, uh, little CD banner things on there also.
3820470	3829033	Um, and then, see, actually, all the, um, DDR Extreme ones have been released with banners, just not by Romani style.
3829313	3830974	They're on another site, but I can't remember which one.
3831554	3832194	So no help there.
3832254	3833295	Just look on DDR Freak.
3833335	3834595	Or not DDR Freak.
3834635	3835535	DDR Maniacs.
3835575	3836956	You'll find a link for it, I'm sure.
3836976	3840317	Let's see.
3840397	3843738	Other than that, not too much going on at all.
3844238	3846898	It's been incredibly slow.
3848639	3850059	No real sim updates.
3850119	3858602	I mean, they had a CSB snapshot update of Step Mania that they're working on that was released back on the...
3859682	3859882	D.W.I 2.4
3874221	3874941	I don't know.
3875182	3876363	There's nothing going on.
3876583	3877884	Just forget it.
3877984	3878545	Slow.
3878905	3886411	Just watch DDR Maniacs and BomaniSims.com for homemade stuff because you'll find the most released stuff there.
3887772	3890455	Bomani style, you'll find the official stuff there.
3891796	3893197	That's pretty much it.
3893877	3899782	Check the Japanese sites because there's always all these Japanese sites you guys are missing and they have really cool shit on there.
3901284	3901544	Cool.
3903661	3910083	And of course, the most notable news in the DWI sim file world, Orange Lounge Radio is doing a contest.
3910263	3912664	Yeah, we're doing a contest.
3913084	3913384	Alright.
3915685	3918246	Okay, so why not, let's do the cage match now?
3919186	3919586	Shall we?
3919806	3920246	Sure!
3921026	3921407	Why not?
3923127	3927208	Alright, well I gotta queue up some stuff, so fill time while I queue up all the cage match stuff.
3927228	3929929	Filling time, filling time, filling up the time.
3930309	3932010	What was the funniest thing that happened to you this week, Jamie?
3933587	3939815	I saw Robin drag.
3941357	3942318	Like a big old queen.
3942338	3944100	No, it was great.
3944220	3944621	You were great.
3945442	3946343	I'm beautiful, dammit.
3946844	3949287	You definitely lit the stage.
3951471	3952672	I'm gonna set this stage on fire.
3953212	3954513	Yep, it was flaming all night.
3956655	3959597	Okay, so, let's start off.
3960718	3962579	Just one second, we're gonna get to... We need our theme song.
3962639	3963620	Yes, here's the theme song.
3964480	3967342	Which, if you were paying attention, you know is Jamie's favorite tax song.
3967462	3968183	I'm now wet.
3968323	3972066	Last week in the Orange Lounge Cage Match, for the second week in a row...
3974491	3976132	Vincent Damore won it with Eternity.
3976172	3978733	So this is the first song you can vote for in tonight's cage match.
3978773	3983115	By the way, if you're new to this, you join our chatroom, you send me tonight.
3983155	3985056	My name is Sky Chatroom Slut.
3985356	3987697	Or you can email them to OrangeLoungeRadio at Yahoo.com.
3988337	3990939	Email the song you like best out of the three you hear.
3991279	3995000	We don't accept votes until the end of the third song when I say send votes.
3995981	3999442	And the winner gets put into Orange Lounge rotation for the whole week.
3999582	4001703	And this song has been in for two weeks now.
4001864	4002724	Looking for its third week.
4003044	4004346	This is the second time this has happened to me.
4033345	4035757	Okay, Jamie's requesting I play a certain part of this song, hold on.
4073491	4075272	Alright, that's song number one you can vote for.
4075312	4077553	That's Vincent Damore with Eternity.
4078373	4080914	Now, I noticed Loki's got something.
4080954	4082435	He's trying very hard this week.
4082455	4084336	He might do it to throw in Eternity.
4084436	4086357	If any song's going to do it, it's going to be this one.
4086637	4088177	I don't even know why I'm going to bother tonight.
4088718	4089998	But, Loki, read it out.
4090378	4092839	Alright, this one's a brand new track.
4093340	4096641	Loki vs. ZZ featuring Sun Decade.
4096661	4100803	This is the debut of the finished version of The Legend of Trance.
4101344	4104100	Here it is, the Legend of Trance, Loki's cage match pick tonight.
4270339	4277963	Alright, that was Loki himself versus ZZ featuring Sun Decade with the Legend of Trance.
4278823	4279964	Well, what did you guys think of it?
4281004	4281284	Jamie?
4281324	4284466	That was pretty good.
4286567	4289689	Yeah, you're looking very pleased with yourself.
4289829	4290889	Of course, I made it.
4291089	4292690	You're looking giddy.
4293671	4295091	I like that song.
4295852	4296392	Get a nine.
4300428	4301389	Are we on?
4301409	4302169	Yeah, we're on.
4302189	4302469	Anyway.
4302509	4303770	Yeah, you get nine.
4305891	4306272	Alrighty.
4306632	4306912	Zero.
4308733	4312955	Well, like, I actually had a chance to listen to it last night on the way the views are.
4313035	4315197	I mean, I definitely give it a nine.
4315257	4316497	It was a great song.
4316918	4319179	It was a great song.
4320100	4321020	Loki, what'd you think?
4322921	4323642	Dare I ask?
4324202	4324942	He gives himself a 69.
4325102	4327624	I like it.
4327984	4329365	I, you know...
4330322	4332506	It can always be better, but yeah, 9.
4332566	4333848	Find a 10, because I can!
4334489	4334790	Alright.
4339657	4341879	I'm sure he doesn't have a big ego now.
4341899	4344062	Um, it was very well done.
4344282	4345163	I give it a nine.
4345243	4347585	Ooh, nines across the board so far.
4348006	4348426	Brad?
4348646	4350888	I think the earlier version of it gets a nine.
4350908	4352070	This, he cleaned it up.
4352090	4352890	This gets a ten.
4353871	4355153	Oh, a ten from Brad.
4355173	4356014	Wait, wait, wait.
4356034	4356874	For the Legend of Trance.
4356894	4357235	Never mind.
4357415	4357935	It was crap.
4357995	4358736	I give it a zero.
4360018	4361999	All right, um, Loki, what...
4362800	4363841	What can I say, Loki?
4364561	4369324	I'm your biggest fanboy, but I'm not going to inflate your ego by giving you a 10, so you get a 9.9.
4369725	4372827	Oh, damn.
4372887	4373747	So he gets a 9.9.
4374868	4375228	All right.
4376549	4381192	So, there is your first two songs, Eternity from Vincent D'Amore and Loki with the Legend of Trance.
4381972	4389177	I've decided, since both of those two are very kick-ass songs, there's no way in fucking hell I was going to win with my original pick, so I'm going for Broke.
4390990	4392372	Forget this trance stuff.
4393012	4395054	I'm just gonna play something that's fucking cool.
4396076	4399960	So my pick for tonight's cage match comes from a little movie you may or may not have heard of.
4400500	4402803	It's a musical, because everybody loves musicals.
4404051	4408375	It's from a little story about a boy who's a girl.
4410997	4412739	And it's called Hedwig and the Angry Inch.
4412839	4419084	So my pick for tonight's cage match is Angry Inch from the movie Hedwig and the Angry Inch.
4419144	4419605	And you know what?
4419625	4421887	This song really would make a kick-ass guitar freak song.
4421987	4423668	So, fuck you!
4423828	4424649	Alright, enjoy.
4424929	4426851	This is Hedwig and the Angry Inch.
4426931	4427551	Angry Inch.
4429253	4431575	One must give up a little part of oneself.
4509955	4511099	Thanks for watching!
4539085	4566968	When I woke up from the operation, I was bleeding down there I was bleeding from the gash between my legs It was my first day as a woman, already that time of the month Two days later the hole closed out, you know The wound healed and I was left with a one inch mound of flesh Where my penis used to be, where my vagina never was, it was a one
4573115	4597275	And I left space It was just a little buzz, there was nothing I could hear Six inches forward, five inches back The train is coming and I'm tired of the track I try to get along but I can't get no slack I got one here and here, and here and here And I got an active four, five inches back Stay on the job until the night turns to night I got my inch, I'm set to attack
4614430	4616672	We got a lot of dots from the chat room.
4617432	4620915	Okay, how do we get the Angry Inch with Angry Inch?
4621195	4622916	Jamie gives it a 10.
4624598	4625739	Loki, it's 0.
4625779	4629662	She just wants to give it a 10 so her song works again.
4630262	4631483	I don't know about that.
4631603	4632604	I guess I'll give it like...
4633923	4636426	It was funny as hell, but I don't know.
4637987	4643593	I will see the movie one day and then I'll give it something higher maybe.
4643733	4646196	I give it an 8 because it had colorful lyrics.
4646276	4646876	Yeah, I give it an 8.
4651551	4656098	I would actually go to Roseville Golf Line and play that for when the parents bring their little children home.
4665652	4674676	You may start sending in your votes now to myself in the chatroom, Sky Chatroom Slut, or you can send those over email to orangebossradio at yahoo.com.
4674696	4675976	Let's review, shall we, really quickly.
4694053	4696075	Choice number one, Eternity by Vincent Damore.
4696095	4700639	Choice number two, Loki with The Legend of Trance.
4721897	4725380	Choice number three, Hedwig and the Angry Inch with Angry Inch.
4739730	4741331	Alright, there they are.
4742452	4743033	Vote now.
4743353	4746015	We'll tally those votes up during the next break.
4747876	4749517	Okay, wow, that was a fun cage match.
4751092	4755315	We had an old favorite trance song, a new favorite trance song, and an anti-trance song.
4756996	4757576	Anti-trance.
4757616	4758877	Good, good, good cage match.
4758937	4759217	Alright.
4760158	4761259	So, what else is up?
4761279	4762579	I need to do my request of the week.
4762960	4764140	You need to do your request of the week.
4764201	4770825	For any aspiring person who wants to make a mix of anything, I want the Safari trance mix.
4771685	4773146	You want a trance mix of the Safari?
4773166	4774347	Yes, my request is still out there.
4774807	4777189	I played the Safari today and I failed very badly.
4777694	4778837	We need to play the Safari during the break.
4779078	4780962	Okay, we'll play Safari during the break.
4781644	4785895	Remember, for whoever makes this for me, I'm going to reward you in some form or fashion if it's cool.
4788338	4792520	Dark Tetsuya was reminding me of something I need to play for y'all just to get what your thoughts are on this.
4792800	4793380	For y'all.
4794221	4795621	I thought I was the southern chick here.
4797442	4799403	I'm just a southern bale in a boy's body.
4800464	4800824	Just kidding.
4800864	4803365	I can get you one of those trail maid dresses.
4804205	4807307	I'm being told that this is a clip from a new song in Poppin' Music 9.
4808347	4810408	Tell me if this sounds a little familiar to you guys.
4865833	4867494	All right, that's the clip we got.
4867514	4869514	Dude, I would play that in Drum Mania.
4869914	4872335	I don't know the story behind that, where that came from.
4872395	4874116	I guess I'm being told it's Poppin' Music 9.
4874236	4877477	I don't know enough about Poppin' Music to know if that's true or not.
4878437	4881278	Check the Japanese site, the music list.
4881738	4886480	Well, from what I remember, the original URL that was posted from was from Bomani Cell.
4887240	4887760	Ah, all right.
4888880	4891361	So, yeah, Guitar Freaks version.
4891401	4892322	I don't know about Poppin' Music.
4892362	4893682	Sounds more Guitar Freaks to me, but whatever.
4894912	4897693	Well, you have Dyke and Ty, I mean, from, uh... True.
4897833	4898333	True.
4898433	4901374	I mean, that's... Yeah.
4901414	4905195	The freaking Cutie Honey theme song in pop music.
4906255	4909816	It's labeled as not as absolute as... It's labeled as avatage.
4910776	4911076	Okay.
4911636	4911956	Whatever.
4915557	4916397	That's what they had on there.
4916417	4922879	They were talking about, like, if they were to make lyrics for it, like, if we drink a real in for a hot limit, it was Icy Frozen Lightning Bolt.
4925928	4928969	I have very few votes registered in right now for the cage match.
4929009	4929990	I hope you all are voting.
4930970	4932531	Send those in, or we'll kill you.
4933471	4934952	Vote or you get kicked.
4935012	4937433	Vote or you, yeah, vote or you get kicked from the chat room.
4937613	4938133	Just kidding.
4938893	4940114	Or we slap you with a trout.
4940214	4942795	Alright, no, but seriously, you guys only have a few more minutes to send votes.
4943075	4944715	Okay, I promised we would play this last break.
4944735	4945376	We didn't get around to it.
4945636	4946736	But this is a JB mix.
4946756	4947857	We've heard something from Loki.
4948117	4950758	One of our other regulars, JB, made a remix of...
4951298	4951838	Guess what?
4951879	4952739	A Jenny Rom song.
4952759	4953560	Uh-oh.
4953760	4954660	But you know what, JB?
4954700	4955301	Hide the children.
4955401	4959744	JB did some good shit with that Sega thing, the Sega CD BIOS music.
4959804	4961245	So I'm actually looking forward to hearing this.
4961285	4962306	I think this will be very cool.
4962666	4965488	This is a remix of Jenny Rom with Do You Wanna Flirt?
4965528	4967850	It's called the Modern Dub Remix, and I'm looking forward to hearing it.
4968270	4969090	And you should, too.
4969110	4970451	This is a remix by JB in our chatroom.
4971132	4972413	Here we go, Orange Lounge Radio.
5208288	5212752	Alright, my apologies to JB because that's the modem mix.
5213152	5214914	Modem dub mix, not the modern dub mix.
5214954	5215594	My bad.
5215875	5216255	Jesus.
5216635	5217516	So that's the modem dub mix.
5217576	5217956	Nice job.
5218097	5218417	Nice job.
5218497	5219117	Alright, back to break.
5219137	5219498	We'll be back.
5318469	5319296	Don't turn me
5402899	5403988	Thanks for watching!
5439253	5443419	Let's listen in on an Orange Lounge Radio staff meeting.
5443640	5445362	Do you want to be accepted by Hollywood?
5445402	5445783	No!
5448166	5449528	Do we care what people think of us?
5450149	5452011	No!
5452031	5453474	Do we want people to kiss our ass?
5453934	5454795	Yes!
5457990	5459891	Extreme Bobani Radio.
5460071	5460711	That's us.
5461252	5463013	Orange Lounge Radio.
5463213	5465034	Because I love it when people kiss my ass.
5465054	5465174	No!
5465794	5466574	Yeah!
5467215	5467955	Sounds like rejected.
5468015	5469436	I say we let him go!
5470116	5471797	No!
5472037	5473238	Best movie ever.
5474978	5477700	Pee-wee's Big Adventure, when he gets kidnapped by the bikers.
5478780	5479881	Did you know that that's Elvira?
5480581	5486364	The female one that grabs him by the neck and goes, I don't remember what she's... That's Elvira, the chick.
5488154	5489155	Well, next time, pay attention!
5516977	5519079	Oh, you slapped somebody with a trout.
5519299	5519499	Yes.
5519659	5520040	Oh, I see.
5520420	5522101	Well, you made me slap somebody.
5522381	5522862	Ha ha!
5523262	5523542	Whatever.
5524163	5524503	Alright.
5525704	5525844	Oh.
5526344	5527625	Now the whole chat room is joining in.
5527665	5527946	Great.
5528446	5529507	I should start trends.
5530448	5531268	You're such a trendsetter.
5531288	5532009	Be like me!
5532810	5533930	Um, let's see.
5534271	5535331	Oh, yes, the cage match.
5536132	5542917	The winner of the cage match tonight was absolutely no contest whatsoever.
5543118	5543938	Why sure ever?
5543978	5544719	Why sure ever.
5544999	5546020	Why don't you announce it, Jamie?
5549509	5550850	The Winner is the Great Space Coaster
5576917	5581161	Alright, so Legend of Trance wins this week's cage match, and we'll probably win for the next four weeks.
5581181	5582682	Who needs someone to do Legend of Cumshot next?
5583703	5588667	Yeah, we need somebody to make one of those erotic... Well, uh... Get some porn noises.
5591209	5593771	I got porn, I could rip audio from that, I suppose.
5594491	5595212	I suppose.
5595772	5597013	I got some gay porn in the other room.
5597314	5598695	Lots of Cumshots and gay porn.
5599596	5600396	Jamie's all, you do?
5601657	5603058	Just kidding, I actually only have one.
5603499	5604860	Irene bought it for me for my birthday.
5606181	5614263	I can just say it now, instead of like, the fly, you know, and like, the birth, it's like, ooh.
5614403	5620024	You know what, they've been wanting a Skies voice remix, so I can do my voice, I can go, it flies.
5621984	5622644	The sticky.
5622784	5623525	Cream of some young guy.
5631073	5631954	Okay, we'll work on that.
5631994	5633775	We'll work on Legend of Kumshock for you guys.
5634276	5637839	And then when it's all fear, it's like, Ugh!
5638179	5638719	Queer!
5639980	5640501	Queer!
5643123	5643603	Okay.
5644524	5645185	We'll work on that.
5645785	5647587	It'll be a present for our loyal listeners.
5648542	5651423	I almost memorized the whole lyrics for a superstar.
5651883	5652163	Why?
5652743	5656005	Because I was going to do a rap and went... Okay, this really sucks.
5656265	5660506	I was going to do a rap, okay, and they wanted... They had this thing for my work.
5660586	5662687	It's a promo thing because we're promoting 8 Mile.
5663987	5668530	and, um, they were doing this, like, wrap-off thing, and it was so you could win $100.
5668570	5670811	I think you actually told us this story two weeks ago, but that's okay, tell us again.
5670831	5682797	Yeah, anyway, so I was gonna do that, and so I memorized, you know, most, I got Superstar, but I ended up not doing it, and a lot of our company people did it, but they made their own wraps for, um, like, our work stuff.
5683337	5683717	Whatever.
5683777	5687478	But this one guy did it out of the blue.
5687518	5689979	He just came up with it right on the spot.
5689999	5690700	That was kind of cool.
5691040	5696842	But instead of having the contest be where you could win $100, everyone that did it got $100.
5696882	5699723	But not me because I didn't do it.
5699783	5699983	Don't!
5702313	5702613	Oh, well.
5703594	5704075	That sucks.
5705397	5706538	What else do we have to talk about?
5706698	5710423	I had something that I wanted to ask or talk about and I totally forgot.
5710443	5711024	It slipped my mind.
5711484	5711785	Damn!
5711805	5712646	I hate that.
5712846	5713407	Bad radio.
5713467	5713787	Damn!
5713807	5714928	I need to write this shit down.
5715689	5716771	That's too much work, though.
5717728	5719790	That's more effort than I desire to put into this show.
5720210	5724934	As Jamie files for nails.
5726096	5726596	FUs of the week?
5726616	5728277	Yeah, why don't we just get to the FUs of the week?
5728297	5728638	Why not?
5729018	5729899	How's that sound to you, Jamie?
5730499	5731080	Jamie's nodding.
5732021	5733482	She's got some angsty things she wants to say.
5734043	5741029	You know, we've been getting advice from some people because the FUs always seem to go on for a long time that we ought to cut back the FUs of the week to like once a month or something.
5741269	5743191	Well, then they wouldn't be the FUs of the week, now would they?
5743611	5745272	Then how long would you think that would be?
5745572	5747614	Yeah, that would be a whole month's worth of it.
5747654	5748775	We'd have to do a whole show.
5749215	5751937	We'd have to have, okay, last Sunday of each month is the FU show.
5752198	5757802	I promise to cut back on the repeat FUs for drivers and stuff.
5757822	5760664	We know that they suck all year round, and there's nothing going to change there.
5761925	5766509	So, you know, maybe we'd have to just instate quotas on the chatroom FUs.
5769005	5770765	So we'll punish you people that bitch.
5772026	5772526	That's right.
5773686	5774386	Yeah, you don't get any.
5774426	5777887	Come on the show and you get to be angsty as much as you want.
5779027	5781288	So, but for tonight, no, we're just teasing.
5781308	5782468	We're giving you guys a hard time.
5782928	5784669	We'll do the FUs like we always do.
5784809	5787089	So, send us those FUs to me.
5787709	5788210	I'm Sky.
5788250	5789210	Am I still chatroom slut?
5789230	5789670	I think I am.
5789930	5793471	So send those over private message to Sky chatroom slut.
5793551	5794851	Jamie, terror or original?
5795191	5795931	Terror.
5795991	5796772	Terror.
5796912	5798352	Cause you're terrifying.
5798772	5799773	Because I had to let it start.
5800453	5802695	Okay, here we go, FU's the week, you know it, you love it.
5805137	5805777	This is fucked up.
5805797	5806377	Okay, my FU's the week.
5806397	5808039	First of all, I'm sorry, I think he's moving his leg.
5808119	5813482	Um, my first one gets more drivers, because it's not, oh shit, it's not moving his legs.
5823415	5824776	I'm sorry, Matt Hedlund on the back.
5825337	5826818	Um, yeah, bad drivers.
5827218	5829439	Especially old people drivers who tailgate.
5830760	5831161	I hate them.
5831321	5831601	Anyway.
5832341	5837285	Um, the next one goes, uh, to, uh, Sack of Imani.
5838085	5838886	To our server.
5839506	5840547	That always goes down.
5841368	5841988	So we're moving.
5842949	5843469	Eventually.
5843529	5843709	Right?
5844210	5844450	Yes.
5844470	5846031	As soon as we possibly can.
5847404	5851606	So, $1hosting.com gets the big finger of the year.
5851746	5853147	They're actually good enough.
5853167	5854587	Them and their stupid pirates, Ark.
5855088	5855648	Yeah, Ark.
5855868	5861891	Um, and I've been listening to you for this in Buffy for two weeks, but you stayed before me, right?
5862491	5862771	I did.
5862811	5865352	I hope, hopefully my roommates didn't believe me.
5865372	5866473	Yay, back on.
5867113	5872195	Um, another one goes toward me for ignoring my Animal Crossing village and my villagers moving out of me.
5872215	5872956	But they still love me.
5874382	5875643	I got Camo Frog.
5875663	5876243	You got Cube.
5876263	5876743	Cube's rare.
5876763	5877484	Cube's a penguin.
5877504	5877924	What's Cube?
5877944	5878284	Penguin!
5878344	5881406	It's an Animal Crossing.
5881426	5882766	We're still talking Animal Crossing.
5898869	5905394	Um, I had another one, oh yeah, another one goes toward last night, me being really sick and out of it and not eating anything.
5906756	5913961	Um, another one goes toward just about every store in this town except for this one ghetto mart in Trader Joe's for not having orange juice.
5915162	5918885	Um, another one goes toward oatmeal cream pies for being an addictive food item.
5920427	5922989	And then one goes toward Walgreens for not having peach propel.
5923649	5925711	But however, they did have propel, but I wouldn't get one for you.
5928301	5933243	Um, another one goes toward a lot of stores in town for not selling balls, because I like blue balls.
5934503	5940225	And, um, another one is going toward, um, my box for being too big.
5940245	5944787	Because I got my slip in my shoe and it really makes me dry.
5945727	5949148	And my big FD of the week goes toward JList.com.
5950108	5954910	I put in my order a month ago for loose socks and Bacari Sweat in soft blue.
5956286	5956926	Do you know what?
5957107	5959128	It's still at night in my house yet!
5959168	5960809	Um, uh, F.U.
5960849	5967052	goes on tour on my Jungle with Taka for the album, and uh, making me spend money.
5967632	5974016	I bought, um, Mega Ranger vs. Car Ranger, on my Switch, and Mega Ranger vs. Ninja Ranger, on my Switch.
5974996	5975897	And other F.U.
5975917	5978058	discs, if you'd like them to play my TV series.
5978298	5979139	And that's it.
5979159	5982260	Did you say hentai TV series?
5982560	5983161	It's hentai!
5986054	5988115	You have special music tonight, Loki, am I correct?
5988255	5993476	Yes, special music, this goes for with my F.U.s.
5993496	5994596	Alright!
5994817	5998518	Most of these F.U.s come from last night.
5998798	5999138	F.U.
5999718	6001698	to Vacaville, because you suck!
6001718	6002539	F.U.
6002559	6009821	the white trash that lives in Vacaville, I really hate you, I don't like you coming up and talking to me.
6011381	6014082	One person in particular is a stupid cowboy...
6014762	6015342	Skater.
6015923	6017864	You can't mix those two genres together.
6017904	6018844	It's like oil and water.
6019124	6029830	Okay, but this jackass comes up to us, starts talking to us, puts his hand... Okay, now, obviously this is going to be bad radio, but he goes up to the table and goes, hits the table and he's like, How you doing?
6029850	6031851	And I'm like, Go away!
6032912	6039575	And then he kept staying there and talking to us and got into a conversation with us and eventually we ended up bringing up the DDR solo thing.
6039715	6042757	He's like, Uh, what's a syringe?
6044429	6046671	Well, maybe if you weren't such a dumbass, you'd know what that is.
6048172	6051815	Then... Oh, yeah.
6052096	6053357	Oh, what about Ecstasy?
6054665	6055666	Then, he tried to hug Brian.
6055886	6057186	Awww, he just wants a hug!
6080020	6081401	He was trying to hug on everybody.
6081421	6083081	He just had this problem.
6083141	6084682	He said this one kid was his lover.
6084722	6086103	He was like a 12 year old kid.
6087483	6088324	You got a problem with that?
6088484	6089544	He was like 17 or 18, the kid was 12.
6089604	6090105	It's like Michael Jackson.
6095467	6098249	First of all, now you know the reason why I love this song.
6098509	6105973	Alright, and, finally, FU2, their machine conditions at that arcade, they suck ass.
6106293	6117879	DVR, the fifth mix, fucking all the arrows are broken, and Max 2, the arrows were set in about one quarter inch into the pads, so it's like, you can't play on that, it sucked.
6118719	6122782	So that's like, their fucking soda machine is broken, okay?
6123042	6125364	I wanted a fucking Sierra Mist and I got a Mountain Dew.
6126104	6126644	What the hell?
6126684	6127945	Then, then, to add that on top of...
6134076	6160824	for all that, then we get to Cusar, okay, there's, the way they have that working out there, it totally sucks, they, the employees don't know what the fuck they're doing, employees aren't really working, they need to put people there, their briefing room's an empty room, they don't have half-day passes, empty room, not painted, empty room, they don't have half-day passes, they don't have half-day passes, they fucking suck, so, yeah, empty to them, um,
6162515	6173526	That's pretty much it, that's all I had, you know, I really was trying to come up with a huge list, I had a bunch of stuff last night, but after a while at QZAR, we had some people come talk to us, they were really nice, and they made me less angsty, so that was cool.
6173546	6174407	Yeah, he was tech.
6174447	6177530	That's it, I'm not too angsty at the moment, if anything comes to me later, I'll take it then.
6177550	6177931	That's it.
6188243	6188683	My turn.
6189504	6198352	I changed my song last week for those who weren't paying attention.
6199172	6203136	My FU for this week goes to Drama, because I've seen too much of it this week.
6204056	6205618	And, like, it needs to go away.
6206739	6207519	I second that.
6207619	6208340	I second that.
6208440	6209761	One more FU and I'll keep this music.
6213124	6214405	Well, this is kind of funny.
6214905	6218087	Let's just say I'm going to give an F you to Twen just because he thinks he's funny.
6218487	6218847	Okay.
6219088	6228113	Twen thinks he's all cool because he went and changed the redirect on my site to some stupid tubgirl.com picture or whatever.
6228753	6233116	Some stupid chick shooting shit out of her ass and into her mouth, which is all photoshopped anyway.
6233356	6235397	Yeah, it's all photoshopped.
6235417	6236738	But anyways, that's not the point.
6236758	6238099	Haha, look what I found on the internet.
6238979	6239700	The whole point is...
6240120	6244181	I don't care, because I don't use that site anymore, you jackass.
6244841	6248222	What you did was just, that'd be like someone messing up my GeoCDs webpage.
6248622	6249462	I don't give a fuck.
6249822	6252903	I thought it was funny, I laughed, and I laughed at you for trying to be funny.
6253543	6256783	Or just attempting to insult me in any way, guess what?
6257144	6259784	You ain't still getting those fucking CDs, and you're a loser.
6259864	6267226	So, oh, there'll probably be a little special gift for you later on, on the websites, but that'll be later on, so, enjoy.
6267246	6269086	This is very funny, but you still don't know all of it.
6269726	6271428	I know, it's hilarious.
6271528	6277253	I totally, you know... Did you see that bullshit in his live journal, by the way, his username is Twin316?
6277714	6278254	On live journal?
6278274	6278875	Go read that.
6278895	6280256	That's fucking hilarious.
6280276	6289404	Because he's so stupid that he thought that... I'm sorry, that was... I was literally reading that going, oh my god, how fucking pathetic his life was.
6289464	6290906	I mean, he truly has no life.
6291326	6292667	You put rape from Loki.
6293327	6295188	Ah, you're funny, man.
6295208	6301870	Wait, I mean, I want to know how, and normally I don't talk shit about people, but he really deserves to be talked shit about because he's so stupid.
6302230	6302790	And you know me.
6303231	6304211	Do I talk shit about people?
6306284	6308085	I'm talking shit about him, okay?
6308545	6321430	First and foremost, first and foremost, anyone who feels the need that they have to do impersonations to try to coerce somebody into saying something that they end up not saying anyway, that's a part of the process.
6323551	6325632	I can do a better job than that!
6325652	6328234	If you're gonna fuck up my site, at least put some effort into it.
6328254	6329374	That was stupid.
6329654	6333557	My god, shit, how long does it take to fucking put a- You know what's even more disturbing?
6333597	6335838	You gotta think about his mental state.
6335958	6339440	If he knew where to find that efficient site, oh my god.
6339460	6340301	I mean, come on.
6340441	6341622	That was weak, Twain.
6341882	6343463	Shit, man, you could do better than that.
6343483	6344463	What the fuck is that?
6344483	6346885	Well, you put as much effort into that as your fucking remixes.
6348447	6352313	I mean, shit, man, you need to, like... How about this?
6352474	6353015	I'll tell you what.
6353035	6357021	Why don't you go get banned from a couple more chat rooms, and then, you know, come talk to me.
6357121	6359525	Oh, wait, you can't because I banned your fucking address.
6359766	6360347	Oh, darn.
6360687	6361649	Don't give a fuck.
6368695	6370876	I don't understand why people don't like me!
6371197	6371957	I'm likeable!
6372037	6373198	I'm a likeable person!
6373278	6374518	I should have tons of friends!
6374538	6375939	The society's messed up!
6389218	6395340	All I have to say is, you ain't bad, you ain't bad, I run with gangs, I run with gangs, I go to school and I kill people.
6396020	6404763	And now I have to say this, because I think we've gotten it out of our system, you have to laugh every time his stupid bullshit comes up.
6406073	6408034	He's not even worth talking about.
6408495	6408875	No.
6408935	6410156	He's a waste of breath.
6410236	6412257	It should be pushed chocolate or something.
6413238	6413838	So... Ouch!
6414358	6417600	Why don't we just say... Twin no longer exists.
6418301	6418641	Alright.
6418981	6419301	Fair enough.
6419321	6420142	Agreed.
6420182	6420982	Agreed.
6421943	6422323	Alright.
6422363	6423324	Can I do my FUs now?
6423364	6424004	Fuck you!
6425125	6425985	My FU... Oh!
6426526	6428127	Wasn't I saying my FU goes to drama?
6428287	6428667	Alright.
6433759	6441630	My other F you goes to superficial people that don't call you because you won't put out on the first date.
6442872	6443633	I hate that shit!
6443653	6444054	Fuck you!
6446368	6446708	Yeah, I know.
6447469	6448709	That's why I've given it an FU.
6449009	6450530	Alright, I'm done.
6450590	6451070	I've had enough.
6451671	6452451	Let's go to Zero.
6452711	6454232	Let's hear if he has any FUs of the week.
6454752	6458034	Mine, the same, also pretty much spawned from last night.
6459495	6464417	That little cowboy skater guy, that was just the greatest ever.
6464477	6466138	You should see him play when he plays DDR.
6466178	6468159	He was playing, what was it, Killing Vision?
6468179	6469500	Like, doing a hoedown to it.
6470160	6484381	He was doing the whole like, oh yeah, era, he was doing the whole like, can't stamp down, jumping around, jumping around, jumping around, jumping around, jumping around, jumping around, jumping around, jumping around, jumping around, jumping around.
6486229	6492435	Oh, and the fact that, okay, he's, um, the other person who went on the, you know, he had a foot on, so it's a VR thing, right?
6492455	6504948	So he's always, you know, here, and all of a sudden he goes and picks up this, like, ratty-ass World Industry skateboard, and, like, it's like he's surfing, like, surfing or something, and it's a great VR thing, and it's, like, a good thing.
6505008	6507831	So that was just, like, it absolutely worked.
6509967	6516109	First of all, I'm going to state this, and I ask that I have the right to do this as a moderator on DDR Freak.
6516129	6517990	DDR Freak does not endorse that guy's skateboard.
6518050	6519730	I feel that I'm justified in saying so.
6528061	6529521	You know what's really sad about that arcade?
6529541	6531802	You can tell where they have their priorities.
6531822	6535843	They have their DDR machines in really shitty conditions.
6535883	6537243	But wait, what's this in the corner?
6537263	6540764	18-wheeler in the giant... It's like an actual size cab of an 18-wheeler truck.
6557921	6569616	I played that once at whatever Riptide Arcade was before it was Riptide Arcade at Pier 39.
6570077	6570958	I played that once.
6578655	6583096	Another thing, don't exactly plan on drinking from the drinking fountains.
6583917	6588598	You go over there, and there's, like, hamburger and cigarette butts smashed into the drake.
6588938	6589558	Burger butts?
6589658	6594060	Burger and cigarette butts smashed into the drake.
6600966	6606327	Did you ever see that episode of Married with Children when Al was barbecuing hamburgers and using cigarette butts and ashes for the... Yeah.
6607187	6612349	And then somehow the dead mother got mixed in, I don't know, anyway.
6612389	6612589	Yeah, yeah.
6612629	6614069	Married with Children is the shit, by the way.
6614129	6623611	And where those drinking pouts were, you'd be afraid to go use them anyway, because they're like... You'd be afraid of getting gang raped or something if you tried to go step back there.
6624580	6627421	and it would be even better if they had another separate bathroom.
6628421	6632642	But in front of the doors were arcade games blocking the doors.
6633702	6636322	Like, you gotta go to the bathroom and get through there.
6636963	6639183	Hey, I have an idea.
6639203	6642044	Why don't we look up to the health board and have it sit down?
6642224	6647185	It's basically like CCL because they have a nice sign on the side of it.
6647205	6648625	Well, the CCL actually is pretty...
6654898	6657020	This is for Irene, even though she's not listening.
6657060	6657721	Um, hello, police?
6657881	6660003	Yeah, um, I'm in a wheelchair, and...
6676007	6677068	Oh, actually, Loki gets mad.
6677088	6677468	Never mind.
6677548	6678048	Never mind.
6678549	6679209	I'll tell you guys later.
6679249	6680210	I'll tell you guys off the show.
6680450	6683772	The highlight of the night was driving there and driving home.
6684293	6685934	Pretty much.
6685974	6698843	I mean, the actual arena at Fusar was cool, and that was about the only time you had fun, was when you were playing the game, except we had to wait for an hour for us to get our first game, and then, like, 45 minutes for the second one, when they were just standing around doing nothing.
6698863	6701825	You just need to have that good trip for both of them to get there.
6703954	6705294	or just go back to VacVille.
6705314	6708536	VacVille's fine, it's just they have really bad organization.
6708736	6714600	Once you, if you're there and demand to go into the game, that's pretty, you'll go in and you'll have a good time.
6714620	6715400	That's pretty much it.
6715440	6718022	It's just that they have some really retarded people crowding around the game.
6719640	6725126	and you get the one guy who, you give him your tickets, like the place, your name, and he says, I'll remember you in the future.
6725206	6732614	And so we have, yeah, we're like, he's like, I'll remember you, and we come back, and like, we're like, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
6735566	6737367	Okay, this is way more important than Vacaville.
6737427	6738848	I got corrected by VidTawa.
6739308	6751394	He said, actually, Peggy spilled Al's barbecue charcoal, and then she told Kelly and Bud to go find some ashes for her, and Kelly goes and steals Darcy's dead mother's ashes, and gives it to Peggy, and then Al cooks the burgers with the dead Darcy ashes.
6751414	6754976	That's right, because ashes make the burgers taste good.
6755076	6758098	But I could have sworn there were cigarettes without ashes as part of the joke.
6758258	6759058	Maybe that was another show.
6759078	6760219	I'm getting my wires crossed.
6760559	6763622	All right, sorry to interrupt, but you know, Mary just showed me some shit and all.
6763642	6768746	I don't know if I can just answer, but after we hear that, you're going to have to stop recording.
6769246	6771648	Oh, yeah, yeah, maybe that'll... Yeah, yeah, yeah.
6771748	6772309	All right.
6772949	6774230	All right, are you done, Cyril?
6774831	6776432	All right, moving on to Dave.
6776692	6781476	And the chat room is getting a little upset because we're not that angsty right now, so you better have some angst in you, Dave.
6782116	6782557	No pressure.
6782697	6783177	I'll try.
6784118	6786560	Okay, and thank you, Rob, for giving this up.
6786600	6786860	It's cool.
6789000	6812869	Okay, um, well, just to let people know I got my license like a week ago or something, and I'm happy about that, but, what, no, I don't have my car, I'm driving my brother's car, right now I'm driving my car, anyway, and fuck the DMV for being the biggest piece of shit ever, oh my god, it's like you get outside and go to Inline and
6814750	6817151	The line is like a rollercoaster line.
6817211	6830877	It goes, curves around four times, then goes outside the door, and then, so we wait in line for about an hour and a half, and we're late for our, you know, then we get there, oh, you're waiting in the wrong line.
6831337	6839641	Go wait in that line, and there's two people in that line, and there's only two people in that line, and so then it's like, shit, I could be out of here by now.
6840532	6859039	So then after we go there, and I get my appointment, I'm angsty, and then I have to go wait in another line, which is you drive your car up, turn the power off, wait 15 minutes, move one spot, wait 20 minutes, and then after about two hours, I finally finish, and so the DMV fucking pisses me off.
6859579	6860719	Fuck you, DMV!
6861860	6862660	I'm angsty!
6863220	6864121	Wah!
6864841	6867583	Sorry, I was going to go on the front like this.
6885755	6887296	I knew that old people drove slow.
6887396	6888736	I knew that old people drove slow.
6911944	6914406	But I didn't know that all keyboards are stupid.
6914446	6918108	Like, they drive, and they see a red light maybe 100 meters up.
6918468	6922491	They start slowing down, and they're going 30 at the time in a 45 zone.
6923211	6925553	And they start slowing down to about 5 miles an hour.
6926013	6930135	The light's still red, they've got about 50 meters to go until they hit the red light.
6930556	6932737	And they're going at, you know, 5 miles an hour.
6933317	6938040	And then the light turns green, they pull to a complete stop, and then they go, like it's a stop sign.
6938060	6940582	And then when they stop behind you, they appear like they're in the background.
6940982	6946803	Yeah, I was actually hit, like, half by an old person, but I didn't want to say anything.
6946884	6948104	Yeah, but you ain't seen nothing yet.
6948144	6953645	There's also the young drivers, no offense to you, man, but there's young drivers that are just stupid, like Prince and Snape.
6953665	6954225	Yeah, I know, I know.
6954245	6956186	I was parking right here at San Juan.
6956346	6959547	There's police cars going everywhere, okay, lights, sirens on.
6959727	6968689	Two police cars behind this dumb bitch, and she's just standing there, like, she's sitting there at the red light, and they're honking their horns, and she's, like, waving her arms, going, I don't know what to do, I don't know what to do!
6969049	6970650	Drive forward, you fucking dumbass!
6970670	6971731	You're trying to go someplace!
6972011	6977774	So then finally she pulls forward a little bit in front of my car, and they nearly hit her ass, and I wish they did because I would serve her right.
6980135	6996043	Okay, anyway, back to my FUs, and I'm kind of scrounged for them, but I think I had a couple more, um, wait, let me think, on 2DX, just fuck all the songs that I can't pass, that's not big news, and fuck Legend of Max for me not being able to pass them yet.
6997074	7005647	and damn it, fuck my memory for doing this a lot and forgetting what I was going to say about fucking other things.
7005807	7007149	Alright, shine, lose, you're finished.
7007169	7007770	Yeah, I'm done.
7007850	7008131	Alright.
7009473	7011796	Chatroom FUs are going to get through these quick, I promise.
7013097	7014358	23rd Mac... Oh, Jesus Christ.
7014598	7015998	You send me so many every week.
7016278	7017619	You're going to get quoted first.
7018339	7018699	All right.
7019300	7024041	King-sized fuck you to parents who think that since they like auto shows, you like auto shows, bitches.
7024421	7025842	Don't drag me to Autorama again.
7025902	7027843	Bite-sized F you to failing DXY Maniac.
7027863	7028323	What the hell?
7028363	7030684	I passed it in my sleep on The Sims and on Conomics.
7030724	7031804	I go to Scandia and fail.
7032204	7034445	Londo F you to loose rivets on the Max 2 at Scandia.
7034745	7037466	I now have a round indentation in my right knee when I tried knee dropping.
7037506	7038247	Thank you, Max 2.
7038287	7038927	I mean, fuck you.
7039007	7040688	What the fuck were you doing knee dropping anyway?
7040708	7040888	Just...
7043528	7044989	Zero in the back says, don't miss the panel.
7045829	7046869	And an Actdeft view to being 17.
7047429	7049269	God damn it, I can't even leave my freaking house.
7049329	7050170	Give me a break already.
7050190	7051550	At least drive me to Scandia once a week.
7051570	7052790	Is that too much fucking much to ask?
7053930	7055671	DarkTetsuya, fuck being single.
7056091	7061412	Still, second the fuck to Sekpamani server and fuck Civ 3 Play the World for not letting me play online.
7061472	7063272	And lastly, fuck the cold that won't go away.
7064212	7065892	Loki, it could be worse.
7066192	7067433	Laser Force, two words.

7188856	7192377	Nope, nothing in the mail.
7195598	7198641	If you can't e-drop and hit the panel, then just don't e-drop.
7198661	7200602	You won't bitch about it.
7204625	7205306	Alrighty-dighty.
7206567	7207528	Uh, break time?
7207688	7208128	Yeah, let's break.
7208148	7208608	I gotta pee.
7208749	7209189	Let's break.
7209629	7210190	Bath and break.
7211130	7212051	What do we want to hear this break?
7212071	7213973	Wasn't there something we wanted to hear earlier in the show?
7215474	7216735	Let's do a disgusting break.
7216975	7217836	A disgusting break?
7217856	7218776	Like bad music break?
7218796	7219317	Like lots of Eurobeat.
7219817	7220978	Ooh, Eurobeat break.
7221619	7221719	Uh...
7223144	7224707	Yeah, I know, we don't want to lose all the listeners.
7225167	7227291	Okay, um, alright, I got it, I got it, I got it.
7227311	7229854	We can do some of those shitty things from Dance Maniacs, too.
7230215	7230475	Okay.
7230716	7232859	Okay, we're going to do, uh, well, what did you get, though?
7233039	7233880	You said, I got it, I got it.
7234321	7234621	No.
7235863	7236564	Okay, you want to hear that?
7236584	7236985	We're going to hear...
7237970	7243235	We're going to hear the Long Train Runnin' version by Xtreme, the band that did A Minute and stuff.
7243255	7244356	Do Let the Music Play.
7244577	7249181	This is not the same Long Train Runnin' that Bus Stop did, which is in Max 2.
7249221	7252565	This is Xtreme's version of it, and it doesn't sound a goddamn thing like the original.
7252865	7257349	And after that, we're going to let it go right into Bus Stop with Let the Music Play.
7257870	7258671	By the way, this is funny.
7258691	7259812	I actually like this mix.
7259932	7261274	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
7280316	7281476	Jamie, headpicked.
7281696	7282817	Shannon, let the music play.
7282917	7284177	Shannon, let the music play.
7284917	7288198	And lo and behold, now we have Bus Stop doing Let the Music Play.
7288919	7296981	Alright, and then I'm supposed to play one of these new promos that some of our fans worked on, so I'll get that in there too.
7297701	7298862	I want to dance!
7298882	7299422	I want to dance!
7498831	7503152	Welcome to Orange Launch Radio, where love is orange.
7504032	7505493	Shaving monkeys is always permitted.
7506653	7507113	Just kidding.
7507373	7514055	But... But it's... You scare the monkey, you don't come in.
7514175	7518116	No, no, I'll just bring Shermie.
7520797	7522357	If Shermie doesn't like you, leave.
7522938	7526250	Proceeding, as always, was brought to you by Orange Lounge Radio.
7744936	7746637	Alright, that was Bus Stop, we'll let the music play.
7746657	7752320	We're going to do one more song from Dance Mania EX2 because we decided we want to do a list list when we come back and we need time to make our lists.
7752881	7755782	So, one more song from Dance Mania EX2 and I'll tell you what.
7755802	7757023	That's something disgusting.
7757063	7759945	You're going to love this song or you're going to freaking hate it.
7760305	7766528	Y'all know Creamy, they're the band that did I Do, I Do, I Do in Dance Revolution Extreme.
7766548	7767629	I do, I do, I do.
7768269	7769290	I don't, I don't, I don't.
7770310	7773312	Anyway, Creamy did a cover of The NeverEnding Story.
7773712	7775774	And it's so cute, it'll make you barf.
7776414	7777214	So enjoy.
7777254	7779115	This is Creamy with The NeverEnding Story.
7779516	7780836	It has a mix name.
7780877	7784919	It's actually the Manhattan Click Extended Remix here on Orange Lounge Radio.
7785179	7787240	Enjoy or despise, you be the judge.
7787260	7788361	And we'll be back with Listless.
7967873	7968902	Thank you for watching!
8015643	8016063	Hello?
8016844	8017124	Hello?
8017164	8017845	Is this thing on?
8017905	8018425	Testing.
8019606	8020467	Testing 1-2.
8021047	8024990	I'm looking in the index, but I don't see anything for how to run a radio show.
8025090	8025570	Hello?
8026231	8027692	I don't understand this.
8028372	8029073	Does this thing work?
8029093	8030674	This thing reads like stereo instructions.
8030774	8031335	Is this on?
8031355	8031975	What the hell?
8034517	8038300	Orange Lounge Radio, Broke Down Ghetto Bomani Radio.
8038380	8038600	What the?
8040475	8041256	Hi, we're back.
8041837	8043018	You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
8043659	8052228	As we promised during that last one, I was creamy with the never-ending story from Dance Mania EX2, so it could be on DDR very possibly.
8052689	8055892	And of course, we had some people, we had DDRholics, says it's so cute!
8056213	8057434	And what did she say that was really funny?
8057454	8059957	It was something about, uh... God, what was it?
8059977	8061058	It was really funny, she said.
8062960	8065521	Something about hamsters dancing in the sky or something like that.
8065541	8066101	It was really funny.
8066161	8066682	I can't find it.
8066742	8066962	Oh well.
8068443	8073766	And then of course we have Arcadian says it sucks and EOSFVB says this song should be banned.
8074967	8076368	This song gives me an aneurysm.
8077388	8082711	Won't be in regular Orange Lounge rotation anytime soon but we reserve the right to play it during any fuck off we want.
8083092	8083372	Alright.
8084266	8085387	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8105567	8107809	The address is right in the topic of our chat room.
8107970	8111814	It's also linked from our website, orangelounge.skie.cx.
8112434	8113535	And then you just click on forums.
8113555	8114236	It'll take you right there.
8114376	8121263	Or if you need the website, here it is, www.calibermani.com slash NBOR3.
8122184	8127990	And we merged with the Naoki Boards of Randomness because they rock and we're a part of their forums.
8129191	8137274	So, you need to get your ass over there to the Orange Lounge forums Because this was an idea that came from the listless suggestion thread And who would have thunk it?
8137954	8153400	Dave was the one that suggested this topic Yay So you should go post in that listless suggestion thread if you think you have an idea Because we're doing this one tonight It was Dave's idea Best warm-up song for DDR
8154899	8156521	So what exactly would be a warm-up song?
8157021	8160686	You don't have to name it, but describe a warm-up song.
8161046	8162207	What defines a warm-up song?
8162928	8171999	The first song you play as a warm-up for your other songs that might be more physically demanding.
8172566	8176147	I think that when we say what our pick is, we should say why we like it as a warm-up song.
8176207	8176407	Yes.
8176987	8179708	And it's basically, I would... There goes the mic.
8180649	8189211	And I would basically think that it would be something very fun and easygoing and not too challenging because... Just starting.
8190132	8190352	What?
8192352	8195613	Yes, it depends on what you're... If you're warming up for Legend of Max, you might play Max 300.
8196054	8196414	I don't know.
8197334	8197414	Ah!
8199163	8200605	We have a request before we get started.
8201005	8202387	Angel wants you to say, we.
8203007	8203248	We.
8203968	8204829	Okay.
8204849	8205150	That's it.
8205530	8205790	All right.
8206151	8207032	And do the Black Mage.
8209574	8210455	Wait, what does he do again?
8210475	8211977	Do the bolt thing.
8212257	8212698	Never mind.
8212818	8213238	Forget it.
8214900	8216061	Let's just get into it.
8216121	8217042	All right, Dave, you start.
8217383	8217703	Okay.
8218484	8220366	My first one is...
8222299	8224422	Oh yeah, I'm being lazy tonight.
8224903	8227386	No, Jamie, you need to memorize all of these.
8227807	8229449	I don't want to erase the erotic ones.
8229489	8230370	I'll just do it underneath, though.
8230410	8231051	Do it on this page.
8231071	8231532	Okay, here we go.
8234355	8237717	Okay, I think... Yes, Rob?
8238137	8239137	Sorry, I'm just laughing.
8240238	8245681	DDRholic already gave us a suggestion for Jane Jonna because it's so smooth and it makes you want to pinch your butt cheeks.
8247461	8247782	What?
8247802	8250683	Never mind, I just thought that was funny.
8250783	8251583	Alright, go ahead, go.
8251764	8260108	Anyway, my first one is Moonlight Shadow because it was really fun and I played it on doubles all the time right before I played Oops, I Did It Again.
8260528	8261308	Fired up mix.
8262429	8262809	Did it.
8264674	8265355	La Copa De Vida
8296475	8297996	Oh my god, you suck.
8298036	8298916	So, Changers.
8299817	8304699	La Coba De Vida, because it's pretty easy to perfect attack, yet it has kind of a lot of different things in it.
8304719	8306980	Triplets, eighth notes, and you know what?
8307541	8311783	People cringe when they hear a Ricky Martin cover, but the song, it actually isn't that bad.
8311823	8313344	I mean, it's, yeah.
8314164	8315445	Dude, that song kicks ass.
8315465	8318306	That was my first choice, but you suck.
8319427	8319767	Sorry.
8320648	8321268	Yes, Jamie, sure.
8321508	8323530	My number three pick is Kakumei Maniac.
8323810	8324731	Kakumei!
8325252	8325652	Maniac.
8326232	8326753	Specifically.
8327594	8328194	Kakumei Maniac.
8328214	8334860	Because I, alright, a lot of people notice that I don't play with freezers and I do it for a legitimate reason because of my ankle being weak.
8335441	8340446	If I have to hold my foot in one position for entirely too long, especially when I'm stepping the other way, it hurts.
8340926	8342948	The thing I like about Kakumei is that it's very easy.
8343972	8355575	as the gallops help me, you know, warm up my legs and everything and get my knees to where they don't hurt and then it, at the end of the song it goes into their run so I'm building up into something better.
8357456	8358756	I actually have legitimate reasons.
8359436	8360236	Good pick, good pick.
8360556	8361137	Alright, Zero.
8362257	8362397	Um,
8362782	8366823	My number three would be doing Miracle Moon on doubles on the heavy.
8367363	8371344	Mostly because it'll work me up into doing my freestyle stuff like Let the Beacon.
8371364	8373685	Do you want to specifically say doubles heavy or just Miracle Moon?
8374325	8375045	Miracle Moon double.
8376846	8378526	Because it's not very hard on singles.
8379206	8379486	All right.
8381467	8382267	Miracle Moon.
8384068	8385388	Loki, your number three pick.
8385408	8387389	It's all about superstar heavy.
8387469	8388649	Superstar.
8388669	8389109	Dammit.
8392143	8393124	I knew that would happen.
8393604	8394864	That's why I didn't put Superstar.
8394884	8400726	I stayed away from that because I knew you guys would totally be putting that.
8400846	8402087	Dave, your number two pick.
8402407	8410029	My number two pick is Senorita.
8410770	8411410	Senorita.
8412904	8414926	I always play that right after I play La Copa De La Vida.
8415106	8419210	Because it gets me really happy, and then I can play a heart song.
8419310	8420091	Oh, it makes you happy.
8422013	8422934	Happy, happy, happy.
8423014	8423835	I feel happy.
8425577	8432984	My number two pick, because this is just great, and everybody loves it when I play this song, and you all love to listen to it, and you know it.
8433244	8434626	My number two pick is this Rain of Men.
8436500	8437521	Oh, that's not a surprise.
8437721	8440362	Because it's not too difficult, and it's fun.
8440942	8441542	It's happy.
8441723	8443263	And it makes people turn their heads.
8443423	8443924	It's happy.
8444004	8444604	And it's happy.
8445364	8446185	So it's Rain and Men.
8446205	8447065	Okay, my number two.
8447265	8448046	Your number two, Jamie.
8448186	8449326	Someone took my number one, Loki.
8450507	8452448	My number two is Share My Love, Maniac.
8452728	8453508	Share My Love.
8453728	8455149	It makes you watch.
8455209	8457150	It starts you watching the arrows.
8457170	8459311	So it's more like a mental warm-up.
8460271	8461072	It's a mental warm-up.
8461392	8461552	Cool.
8463783	8464763	Zero, you're number two pick.
8464923	8467284	My second one is Little Bitch.
8467824	8468664	Little Bitch!
8468784	8477805	Because not only does it match the specials shirt I just got the other day, but it's a good warm-up for going into my Ska routine that I'm working on.
8478766	8479746	It'll be good when I get it done.
8480226	8483506	So we're talking about the original Little Bitch, not Bus Stop's one-two Little Bitch.
8483566	8485847	No, the original, original specials.
8486467	8486847	Cool!
8489567	8489808	Loki.
8489828	8491428	Let's see, Let's Groove...
8496052	8497533	Let's screw up tonight
8509481	8510902	Oh, hello.
8511242	8511803	Okay, Dave.
8513404	8514524	Earth, wind, and fire, you ain't.
8515025	8515305	Okay.
8516245	8519407	Anyway, my number one actually has a story kind of behind it.
8520088	8525111	And, um, it was a long... The story is that your real number one got taken.
8525991	8530553	Well, that was the story for my number two, but now it's moved on up the list.
8531313	8533474	And because I can't think of anything else off the top of my head.
8534014	8537835	And it was, I think, a year or a year and a half ago, maybe two years.
8540036	8544137	Wow, Jamie's holding a lighting pen up to her forehead so she can see the lights.
8545377	8553000	And it was the first time that I ever met Rob and Jamie and all these other people.
8553700	8555563	that I thought were really weird at the time.
8556505	8566783	And I played with Rob the first time before I'd met him on a fourth mix at Roseville Golf Land and he picked
8568365	8571068	I don't know, was it Bumblebee or something like that?
8571148	8575672	You know, one of the songs that my brother plays with me.
8576012	8577033	And then I picked Dropout.
8577493	8578234	And that's my choice.
8578494	8579155	Just Dropout.
8579455	8580636	Because it was so fun.
8581157	8583599	And Rob was just like gasping for breath.
8583879	8585200	He's like, this is my first game.
8586081	8586682	Oh my god.
8587122	8588043	And I was like, sorry.
8588083	8590865	And then I picked Afronova afterwards to fuck with him.
8591846	8593688	No, but Dropout because it's really fun.
8594429	8594809	And yeah.
8595575	8622564	Yeah, alright It gets me warmed up, you ass Alright That made me think though, I left one off my list I really want to put it on here, but I guess next time But the number one, and it deserves to be my number one Because this was the ultimate warm up song Especially back in the day, I always played this first song You know it, this song is the shit Oh Nick, please not so quick God, all the fucking time We got the fourth mix, you were like Oh my god, I love you, Onik I want to help the machine
8623345	8624766	Let's see if I can fit in the coin slot.
8626268	8626708	Please.
8628009	8629711	I actually remember you saying that once.
8633454	8634355	It wouldn't surprise me at all.
8634375	8635976	It was right before my birthday, come to think of it.
8637878	8638178	Alright.
8639259	8639880	My number one.
8640681	8640921	Yes.
8641361	8643763	Well, my original number one got taken, so my number two moved up.
8644004	8644264	Alright.
8644584	8647447	And everyone knows that I've been starting off with this a lot lately.
8647947	8648728	Cowgirl Maniac.
8650419	8652400	Just because the little Skippy Hops.
8652921	8656143	I normally suck at Skippy Hops, and now I can do Skippy Hops really well.
8657484	8658124	The Skippy Hops.
8658344	8664669	Because they're not the true... I don't consider them true gallops like in, you know, Saints Go Marching or like in Rhythm and Police.
8664949	8665689	They're Skippy Hops.
8666670	8667250	Skippy Hops!
8668071	8669912	Sounds like a breakfast.
8672654	8673855	New Cowgirl Skippy Hops.
8673955	8675056	Grassy Sod Klops.
8675476	8676737	That was on Ren and Sippy.
8678298	8680099	With that freshly mowed lawn flavor.
8681667	8681927	Anyway.
8682427	8683468	Zero, your number one choice.
8684168	8687769	Um, yeah, I'm surprised that guy over at, uh, Vacaville didn't play that song.
8688169	8696391	Anyways, uh, my number one, all together, is doing Spin the Disc, single, heavy, because it works into my main freestyle routine.
8697231	8699692	So I definitely will have to pick that.
8701373	8702373	Spin-ta-disc!
8704315	8706557	Last one, Loki, what is it?
8706657	8707678	Number one warm-up song.
8707798	8711722	I played this yesterday, but the pad was fucked up.
8712162	8713644	This stupid fucking pad.
8714184	8715205	It's moving on!
8715866	8716667	Moving on!
8717547	8718889	Moving on from fifth mix.
8719229	8723653	It was the only mix it was in, and it was so cool, and they took the... Oh, no...
8736481	8748011	We have Moonlight Shadow, La Copa De Vida, Cockamamaniac, Miracle Moon Doubles, Superstar, Señorita, It's Raining Men, Share My Love, Little Bitch, Let's Groove, Dropout, Nick, Please Not So Quick, Cloud Girls, Spin The Disc, Whip On
8748956	8749516	Brad.
8750337	8752258	Now, songs we forgot.
8753118	8755820	It didn't hit me until part of the way through when Dave was reminiscing about 4th Mix.
8756120	8756980	I forgot Bakwa.
8757500	8759621	That used to be the ultimate warm-up song.
8759762	8760462	Yeah, me too.
8760482	8761262	You know what?
8761402	8764124	I'm remembering my usual set on 1.5.
8764364	8766765	It would always start off with Boom Boom Dollar.
8768006	8768366	Trick.
8769693	8771114	Yeah, I used to play that a lot, too.
8771434	8781380	It would always be Boom Boom Dollar, and then My Fire, and then it would be Brilliant COG.
8782080	8782360	Cool.
8783181	8791045	No, but I was thinking about doing Synchronized Love, because it's really fun, and it's kind of, but no.
8791766	8793347	Anyway, so I have to take one off, huh?
8793707	8793967	Yeah.
8794467	8796148	Damn, these are all pretty good choices.
8797249	8798950	And I play them all fairly...
8799813	8800313	A lot.
8801374	8801715	Yeah.
8802395	8807279	But, um... Damn it.
8807560	8807860	No.
8808480	8810782	No, I like that song too much.
8811603	8812464	I think Let's Groove.
8813845	8815947	Let's Groove goes bye-bye.
8815967	8816467	I don't know.
8817628	8820030	Too slow and not enough fun.
8820671	8825255	I'm just saying, Let's Groove is sort of one of my cool-down songs if I need to take a breather.
8825592	8825832	I don't know.
8825852	8827293	It's more of a cool-down than a warm-up.
8828814	8830835	You know, I'd let the beat hit them in the same category.
8831155	8832435	Yeah, same.
8832535	8839819	I do one of those songs in between playing like an extreme edit and doing my PA for Legend of Max qualifier thing.
8840459	8843921	Anyway, so, these are all pretty good picks.
8844461	8846282	However, I'm just a bitter little asshole.
8846302	8847002	I'm taking off dropout.
8849608	8850468	What the hell are you smoking?
8850528	8851349	Dropout is a warm-up?
8851569	8852509	I mean, I guess so.
8852770	8859013	I mean, especially, you know, as the bar's kind of been raising and raising, I remember when most people used to go, oh my god, you can pass Dropout Maniac?
8859053	8861494	And you were like the shit if you could pass Dropout Maniac.
8862194	8863755	And now it's nothing, you know?
8863815	8866176	So I can see where it's kind of gone to that level of warm-up.
8866236	8870398	I know, but I mean, for some people, for some people, I'm saying for the people that it used to be, oh my god.
8870959	8875361	I know, but I'm saying for the people that it used to be, oh my god, now it's like, you have to be able to pass Max...
8876561	8877122	300, Three Speed Shuffle
8906081	8907161	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
8932765	8933386	I don't care.
8933406	8937310	It was fun in Samba de Amigo, but sucks for DDR.
8938010	8939792	Did you see my routine to it?
8940232	8941994	Where I do the pelvic thrust for the whole song?
8943696	8945377	Drive you insane, yeah, yeah, yeah.
8947179	8948560	That's all the more reason for me not to see it.
8949381	8949982	You're too young.
8951488	8952229	Moving on!
8954411	8955032	Zero, oh yeah.
8955613	8963641	I would probably take on Señorita, because I don't really like a lot of those songs that sound like that on DDR.
8964482	8965904	Because they just get kind of boring.
8966164	8968947	Señorita comes off the list, and JB's crying.
8969267	8972911	One of my old favorite warm-up songs that a lot of people don't like is Lupin the 73rd.
8974420	8975841	I don't know if I consider that a warm-up.
8977461	8982283	Yeah, but not the maniac stuff, but the easier, the beginning.
8982963	8984364	By the way, it's Lupin the Third.
8985484	8986484	Lupin the Third was anime.
8994507	8994847	Here we go.
8995447	8996388	Loki, last one.
8996488	8996988	What's coming off?
8997628	9003973	You know, I hate this song on Maniac Doubles, and it can kiss my ass, because that is no six, bitch.
9004593	9005494	Moonlight Shadow.
9005914	9007035	Moonlight Shadow?
9008176	9008476	Alright.
9009537	9010517	Yeah, I don't know about a warm-up.
9010577	9015761	I think the singles, Maniac... Actually, the singles makes a really good warm-up, I think.
9015961	9018003	You know what we forgot to add onto the list?
9018263	9018783	What?
9019364	9020945	Yeah, oh, Ghost was a good one.
9021265	9021706	Very well.
9022906	9023867	Well, you think of them after...
9026258	9028719	You think of them when you, uh, when it's too late.
9029759	9031540	Alright, so, there's the list.
9031580	9034421	Send me your votes right now, now, now.
9034901	9035542	Jamie, read it.
9036082	9039103	Um, oh, I was just thinking that people, our people should be in DDR, but nevermind.
9039703	9049167	Um, Cockamamaniac, Miracle Moon Double, Superstar, It's Rainin' Men, Share My Love, Little Bitch, A Nick Who's Not So Quick, Cowgirl, Spin the Disc, and moving on.
9049207	9051127	By the way, I was supposed to specify Cowgirl Maniac.
9052008	9052548	Oh, my bad.
9052808	9053508	And Cock, yeah.
9053748	9055249	Oh well, people get the idea.
9055689	9056410	Oh, mine are maniac.
9057290	9057891	So share my love.
9058451	9060653	Okay, so... Vote.
9061253	9061593	Yeah.
9062214	9062854	Vote, bitches.
9062955	9064536	I mean, my dear people.
9064936	9065276	Okay.
9065717	9066998	And in the meantime, we're going to take a break.
9067018	9068719	So you only have like a minute to send me your votes.
9068759	9070981	So send them now or we'll boot you from the chat room.
9071381	9072101	Just kidding, we won't.
9072141	9073863	But, you know, please participate.
9074303	9075144	Let's do something old.
9075524	9076084	Something old?
9076184	9078726	Yeah, let's go for Brilliant to UOG.
9079347	9080828	Brilliant to UOG.
9081228	9082109	And Boom Boom Dollar.
9082967	9084808	Brilliant to you, OG, and Boom Boom Dollar.
9084929	9085649	And Bad Girls.
9085729	9086670	Okay, that's it.
9086890	9087651	You heard it here.
9087711	9089132	That's what we're going to hear right now.
9089152	9096137	We're going to hear Bad Girls, Boom Boom Dollar, and starting off we have Brilliant to you, OG, send me the votes now.
9096157	9098359	You have until the end of Boom Boom Dollar to do it.
9098639	9099780	That's when voting's closed.
9100320	9100761	We'll be back.
9188089	9190196	Boom, boom, money, signing, dollar
9341380	9351227	From StepSquad to Orange Labs, this PDR sucks!
9351828	9352148	Holler!
9352168	9352288	P.S.
9352368	9353109	T.T.P.O.
9356871	9357452	Hi, we're back.
9358372	9359373	Jamie, you want to do a shout out?
9361415	9362055	You want to do a shout out?
9362215	9362415	Yes.
9363536	9363997	Shout out!
9365097	9365318	Sorry.
9365438	9365598	Ow.
9365758	9365818	Ow.
9367080	9372241	My shoutout goes to Jahi for staying with me while I was going insane driving around, so thank you.
9372942	9373662	Thank you, Jahi.
9373722	9374582	My blood sugar sucks.
9376222	9376662	Cool.
9377623	9378343	Jahi is the man.
9378403	9378823	He's the shit.
9378843	9379483	He's awesome.
9379503	9381544	And he has very interesting things to say late at night.
9381864	9383084	Everybody needs to know a Jahi.
9383104	9383904	He needs to be on the show.
9384644	9385885	He needs to be on the show.
9386305	9386785	Like, here.
9387918	9389039	He's been via tape.
9389099	9391781	He's never been here, but hopefully soon, right kids?
9392361	9394003	He's been talking about moving, maybe.
9394063	9394843	I don't know if that would happen.
9395424	9396384	During a drunk show.
9396845	9397926	Maybe you should get him next week.
9398506	9400227	Jahi would be a suitable replacement for me.
9400448	9401709	Because, you know, we're so alike.
9402689	9406412	I think that Jahi would be as difficult to get drunk as me.
9406432	9408654	That'd be interesting.
9408734	9409755	Well, it's a three hour show.
9410415	9411536	A three hour train wreck.
9413231	9415057	Alright, you want to hear the winners of this list?
9415097	9415619	Yes, you do.
9416382	9417646	Best warm-up song?
9418167	9419211	I need drumrolls, people.
9419311	9420134	Third place!
9422583	9424225	That's the most unenthusiastic.
9424465	9425786	That was you slapping yourself.
9425806	9426666	Alright, applause, whatever.
9426966	9427807	There you go, there you go.
9428107	9430109	Third place is... The audience is now deaf.
9430649	9431569	The audience is horny.
9432010	9434732	Third place is... Spin the dick.
9435272	9436093	Spin the disc.
9438014	9439355	Spin my disc.
9439475	9441196	Alright, spin the disc is number three winner.
9441636	9442977	Number two winner is...
9444578	9450640	Superstar, Wee, and the number one winner, and I must say this even surprised me, but it's beautiful.
9451840	9456061	Oh, Nick, please not so quick, is the number one best DDR warm-up song.
9456121	9456822	Amazing.
9457282	9458182	How did that happen?
9458622	9459042	I don't know.
9459102	9461143	But it is the best DDR warm-up song.
9461203	9461983	Very close call, though.
9473101	9476663	More than Jake's very pissy because Little Bitch didn't get in there, but it was very close.
9476723	9478984	It was very close, but... Sorry.
9479444	9481145	I just explained something to Zero.
9481465	9481585	What?
9481605	9482586	What'd you have to explain?
9482686	9486387	When you said, oh, Nick, please not so quick, wondering how it got into DVR, I said, so small.
9487048	9489129	Like, the Chimpoco Mine episode of South Park.
9489629	9491530	I just explained to Zero what Chimpoco means.
9492610	9493571	It means small penis.
9496144	9502726	Alright, so Evil Now Q2DX is celebrating by humping 3rd Korean machines across the United States.
9505687	9510809	Caution off of whatever version of 3rd it was, 3rd Korean whatever, that was a good song.
9511209	9513950	No, you know what the best fucking 3rd Korean song is ever?
9514850	9515511	No, Wah.
9517351	9518352	Wah is the shit.
9518692	9519412	No, Wah.
9519452	9519772	Face.
9521313	9522053	Face is okay.
9522523	9524884	By the way, speaking of... No!
9524964	9525584	Beel!
9526324	9530366	I remember the fucking guy at Golfland that used to be able to do Beel backwards.
9530526	9531687	Enrique.
9531707	9532747	He was one of our originals.
9532767	9533747	Yeah, I remember that guy.
9534848	9536228	He used to do Beel backwards.
9536408	9537649	We'd all go like, ew, Beel.
9537689	9539310	It was like, oh my god, he can do it backwards.
9539330	9540870	He would do the perfect boy band dance to it.
9540930	9541350	Yeah, he does.
9541370	9542291	He had a perfect boy band dance.
9542471	9542911	That was great.
9544847	9545127	Oh, okay.
9545368	9546809	That just stopped the show down the track.
9546829	9547489	That's alright.
9547990	9549271	We're reminiscing about Beul.
9549311	9551073	That's when you know we're desperate for material.
9551393	9553475	Okay, and now we should do our other favorite segment.
9553715	9554015	What?
9555116	9556377	Ask Orange Lounge!
9556417	9558339	Haven't we beat this segment to the ground?
9558379	9559620	Haven't they asked all their questions?
9560080	9561201	Let's just story time with Loki.
9561241	9561722	You have a story?
9563143	9567104	It's something that reminded me... Alright, great, we get to do Storytime with Loki.
9567405	9571507	If we can do a really quick Ask Orange Orange to me.
9571587	9572607	How about this?
9572627	9576229	Sir, send in questions, and it'll be a really quick story.
9576609	9581151	And it's unfortunately not porn-related, so... Aww, what fun is that?
9581171	9581912	I'm sorry!
9582512	9584913	Alright, so... I was just going to talk about how retarded Q's are, player.
9584973	9590456	I don't know, what are we going to... Let's... Storytime with Loki, what... I know, but that's our...
9592462	9592982	Oh, whatever.
9593042	9593643	It doesn't matter.
9593663	9595343	This is going to be so quick anyways.
9595543	9595863	We'll do it.
9595883	9596524	We'll do this one.
9596544	9597084	This will be funny.
9598244	9598625	Oh, anyways.
9598965	9600405	So let me go ahead and just start anyways.
9601346	9604487	I was going to tell you guys about this one person we used to play Cuesar with.
9604507	9611330	Now, this woman is like... She had to be in her 30s, if not older, in her 40s or something like that.
9611430	9612870	And she's still playing Cuesar.
9612950	9614731	And she was like, this is what happens...
9616522	9621824	This is what happens when... This is what happens when retarded people grow up.
9622585	9622865	Alright?
9623165	9626447	And they serve no purpose in society other than just to annoy you.
9627147	9631829	So this bitch, looking to find where she fit in, she thought she fit in with Cusar.
9632669	9633730	Well, she was terribly wrong.
9633750	9639993	She sucked ass, she's played for like five years, and the reason she likes playing is because the packs vibrate.
9642037	9644480	And she liked vibrating packs.
9644580	9653270	And she would only, and she got pissed off and would, we'd shoot her up, which we'd always use the, you know, aggro, like hell, you know, because she was retarded.
9655883	9656804	That's not nice!
9657684	9661705	And that's my story, and that's it.
9663806	9668947	That's my story, and she bought a pack and built her own little mini arena in her house, and she sucks.
9669827	9671108	And her name was ZapZap.
9671288	9672488	Her husband's name was ZipZip.
9678151	9681034	I get to go to a bachelor party at some point, I think in the next few months, so we'll have some definite stories from that.
9681054	9682695	Can you take something from me?
9682715	9683856	What's the thing you have behind your back?
9683876	9684036	Show me.
9684056	9684557	Show me.
9706592	9713536	What do you have behind your back?
9713556	9716838	Show me.
9717238	9719139	What'd you take out of my pocket?
9719419	9723562	What were you doing?
9723582	9725043	You're not nice.
9731407	9732728	That was smooth and deadly.
9737145	9738026	I don't smoke.
9738086	9740007	Smoking is bad for you, kids.
9740027	9741327	Yeah, yeah, y'all are funny, huh?
9760515	9761916	These cigarettes have been down your legs?
9763638	9763999	Alright.
9764119	9765140	Tastes like crack.
9765200	9768523	Quite a few questions tonight for Ask Orange Lounge, so let's get to it.
9768583	9769224	I'm surprised.
9769284	9770946	Usually I have to berate people for questions.
9772667	9774809	Alright, kiddies, it's time for that segment.
9776437	9778238	Tell us about Ask Orange Lounge, Jamie.
9779438	9780318	Basically, I'm buying time.
9780398	9781219	Ask us a question.
9782219	9784680	You might get an answer, but you might not always like what you hear.
9785340	9789081	This segment was born from the fact that we've run out of things to talk about.
9789381	9794623	And so we rely on you, the audience, to, you know, kind of jumpstart the show again.
9797204	9798665	Okay, that wasn't a question.
9798685	9800185	I was excited.
9800565	9802966	You must ask a question in the form of a walrus.
9802986	9803426	Let's see.
9803566	9804206	More than Jake543, uh...
9806480	9808561	What do they do, they do, they do love me?
9808761	9810241	I don't like scary stalkers.
9811321	9814142	They just make themselves in the self-love.
9814162	9815982	They're admitting to being public masturbators.
9816483	9817023	Oh, okay.
9817863	9819483	Like Creamy, you know that song, I do, I do, I do?
9819563	9820024	What are they doing?
9820044	9820984	Where did they get their name from?
9821004	9821564	They're all Creamy.
9822764	9825305	By the way, you know they're like a couple of 16-year-old girls, right, Creamy?
9825385	9825565	Yes.
9829443	9831485	Yeah, I make them creamy.
9831625	9832706	I have a question for you, Rob.
9832806	9833046	What?
9833627	9835328	Sometimes you just feel not so fresh.
9836569	9837190	Yeah, right now.
9839412	9842054	And he also wants to know, hey, what's that rash from?
9844276	9844737	Dry rot.
9846638	9846818	Ew.
9847559	9848380	Alright, dry rot.
9849850	9850390	Moving on.
9850871	9852252	EOSFBB has a question.
9853913	9858116	Previously on Orange Lounge Radio, I recall somebody mentioning Chocolate Cool Whip.
9858456	9863480	However, when I went to my local supermarket, they didn't have it, and the Cool Whip website didn't have it either.
9863560	9866682	Can you confirm the existence of Chocolate Cool Whip?
9866882	9868943	I can indeed, because I used to buy it in Medioc.
9869824	9871665	It may only be sold in these customers.
9871926	9875868	But what I bought at Ralph's was Chocolate Ready Whip in the spray can.
9875908	9876048	The...
9877369	9881313	Ah, so, okay, so Chocolate Ready Whip is what you can easily find out.
9881694	9886498	Now, I have seen Chocolate Cool Whip, except I don't know if it was Chocolate Cool Whip.
9886538	9888100	I think it was Chocolate Generic Cool Whip.
9888120	9888861	No, it was Chocolate Cool Whip.
9888881	9889301	Really, okay.
9889321	9890702	Interesting.
9890903	9891803	It may be discontinued.
9891824	9892444	This was a few years ago.
9893005	9895387	I'd like to know what EOSFVB is going to be doing with Chocolate Cool Whip.
9895807	9896608	But I was just with it.
9897609	9898770	I was making ice cream.
9898830	9899991	I had a creme brulee and I was bored.
9900011	9901032	Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.
9902506	9907911	Also, EOSFBB asks, where can I find females to say something for my porno music I made?
9908251	9912654	These things need to be said sensually through the word I've been using is orgasmically.
9913575	9917558	Always, all that I've asked have declined mentioning that they were not whores.
9918339	9922202	Offer to pay them money to say this word, and then be like, okay.
9922222	9923704	What's the word?
9923924	9925525	My suggestion... What's the word?
9926366	9928768	Orgasmically, I don't... I'd close the window.
9929308	9931370	I don't know, he just needs dirty phrases said.
9935267	9937629	I would say, honestly, my suggestion, Yahoo.
9938169	9939630	There's tons of freaks on Yahoo.
9942192	9943673	Go to Yahoo.
9943713	9945254	You'll find women that'll do anything on Yahoo.
9945274	9949637	Take that money, rent some pornos, and rip audio from them.
9950338	9950638	I know.
9951198	9951719	This will work.
9952139	9953760	It's not boner, it's boner.
9953780	9956082	No, I have the bona fide trick that'll work for you, SFEB.
9956920	9960082	Tell the women you're gay, because then they'll do anything for you.
9960682	9961503	They really will.
9963164	9964305	Then he'll never get a date again.
9965185	9974251	But no, because then you go, oh gosh, you know, as much as I love, you know, anal sex and blowjobs, I really want to try a pussy someday.
9974291	9976952	And then all the women will go, oh, me, me, me, I'll help you out.
9978173	9978513	Really?
9978533	9980254	I'll have to remember that if I ever become single again.
9981860	9986241	Phil, you know, I'm, like, gay and all, but would you, like, suck my cock?
9986642	9987642	Would that work?
9990063	9994844	I'll just pretend you're a guy, and, yeah.
9995244	9996345	Okay, moving on.
9996385	9999386	Last week's Orange Lounge.
10001967	10007448	EvilNauki2DSX asks the question, Why are there no poppin' music machines in NorCal?
10008229	10008809	Because we suck.
10010856	10013158	How do you get hemorrhoids the size of melons?
10036076	10038818	You get really constipated and then try to take a big shit.
10040159	10047784	Eventually, after having a whole life of nothing but bad constipation and trying to push your intestines out through your ass, you'll grow a hemorrhoid.
10048804	10049305	Beautiful!
10050065	10051126	Also work a desk job.
10055329	10055689	Alright.
10057870	10064135	Actually, I know this because I was looking up stuff on the internet, medical stuff, and I found hemorrhoid advice.
10064215	10064575	Beautiful.
10065219	10071481	Vidpower asks, will my American PlayStation 2 peripherals work on a Japanese PlayStation 2 and vice versa?
10072001	10075783	Will his American PlayStation 2 peripherals work on a Japanese PlayStation 2 and vice versa?
10076183	10076403	Yes.
10076983	10077563	Goddamn.
10078183	10083385	You know, I've been using a Japanese NetCon for like years to play Wipeout on my American PlayStation.
10084306	10085106	So, yeah.
10085446	10087367	And he also wants to know, do we Yahoo?
10089909	10095012	I would like to say once again the email address if you ever want to send your comments or suggestions to Orange Lounge Radio.
10095092	10102336	Yahoo.com Orange Lounge Radio at Yahoo.com Yahoo!
10102436	10104678	23rd Magus wants to know, original or extra crispy?
10107659	10108660	Extra Crispy, bitch.
10109800	10111462	I would vote Extra Crispy as well, sorry.
10112262	10115004	Then again, if I get chicken, I usually pull all the skin off of it anyway.
10115024	10118066	I don't eat that crap, you know?
10118366	10119607	You know how bad that crap's for you?
10119627	10121849	It's nothing but flour and grease.
10123330	10124831	Mmm, mmm, grease.
10126051	10126412	Okay.
10127192	10130074	Also, 23Romangos has a specific question for Loki.
10130754	10134237	Loki, what would you do with two quiet Jap girls and a bucket of chocolate ready whip?
10135836	10137277	I don't like chocolate ready whip.
10138217	10141659	No, if we're talking regular ready whip, that's a whole different story.
10143420	10147402	I would have them perform a wonderful little strip tease while I eat ice cream.
10156987	10159468	It's two things I enjoy, strip teases and ice cream.
10159508	10160909	Oh my god, Rob, you're matching your shirt.
10161866	10164887	Rob's wearing this lovely red shirt that says, I hate myself and I want to die.
10165907	10166908	And he's matching it now.
10167808	10168788	It's my Nakari shirt.
10169389	10169949	You're glowing.
10172190	10176631	That was quite possibly the funniest thing that's ever been said on this program, in my opinion.
10177151	10178212	I would watch guys do that.
10178772	10179192	Okay.
10180472	10181413	Okay, now Loki.
10182433	10183353	23rd Mega says another question.
10184094	10187495	I do want to know, why don't they serve ice cream in a fucking strip club?
10188542	10189103	Why don't they?
10190023	10191825	Okay, let's open up a strip club.
10191845	10194527	And it'll be ice cream and boobs.
10196289	10197590	I want ice cream and dick.
10199592	10201813	And on Wednesday could be like banana split night.
10201894	10203635	And they serve spotted dick.
10205336	10205497	What?
10205557	10207358	It's a British delicacy.
10207578	10211161	I want to make phallic sundaes.
10212022	10214785	I want to come up with desserts that look like, you know...
10216466	10217267	I don't know, man.
10217287	10220068	It's just like, they serve all this greasy food and you feel sick to your stomach.
10220088	10222770	You want something, like, comforting like ice cream.
10242013	10243574	Okay, anyways, what's the other question?
10243594	10247436	The other question is, what would Rob do with two quiet Jap girls and a bucket of chocolate ready whip?
10248437	10249938	But he's asking you what I would do.
10250038	10250738	What you would do?
10251939	10252559	I don't know.
10253099	10258343	You'd send the girls over to Matt's house and... I know what Rob would do.
10259644	10262866	He would just have them stand there with their boobs out and eat the ice cream.
10262906	10264767	Because Rob likes boobs.
10266033	10272775	DarkTetsuya wants to know, you think the arcade would be a good place to find a girl?
10285874	10291676	Actually, I met a guy who I dated for about a month when I worked in an arcade.
10292236	10299738	Alright, I should let you finish your story, but anyways, I was going to say, meet women where you like to meet.
10299938	10307580	I mean, basically, like, say for instance, you're in the arcades or that kind of stuff, or you're into this, you'll find people that are into the same kind of stuff in those places, you know?
10308140	10309201	Just not home.
10309261	10310102	Don't meet women at home.
10310122	10311583	Yeah, don't meet women at home.
10311663	10313224	Even if you like to be home, don't meet women at home.
10313244	10319450	Online is sort of okay, because nowadays you can kind of find out... I met Dan, and we're celebrating our five-year anniversary this Friday.
10320671	10324594	But, no, if online's alright... It's just risky.
10324714	10325475	Online's risky.
10325635	10326956	Jamie took a gamble and she won.
10327156	10328998	Online, yeah, online's kind of risky.
10329318	10332060	Now, if you happen to be within, like, say, the 18 to 21-year-old range...
10334182	10340487	I happen to know, because I was looking for my friend, my friend, um, Sean, okay, on Yahoo, the personals.
10340667	10342849	Man, there's some crazy people out there.
10342869	10348093	There's some women that are damn hot, and they're like, you know, wanting people to go out with them.
10348473	10351815	Except for the one chick, because she was, uh, her best friends were her parents.
10352816	10355838	But she was hot, so I feel like I'd overlook that, just for that.
10357159	10357640	Seriously.
10357900	10358540	Go to college.
10359281	10360041	Oh, college.
10360061	10360462	Oh, definitely.
10360482	10361082	Go to college.
10361563	10362523	College, yeah.
10365351	10366852	Okay, next question.
10366872	10367913	That's good advice.
10368813	10369834	Find women where you like to be.
10370875	10373676	Angel says, just a side question really, did you ever find the ferret?
10374657	10375337	No, we didn't.
10375458	10376938	I didn't even think to look for it this week.
10377739	10381701	I'm going to be cleaning up this room pretty good the next couple days because I promised Brian I would.
10381882	10382302	Yeah, shut up.
10383062	10384103	So we'll see if we find it.
10384723	10386464	But no, we haven't found it yet, amazingly enough.
10386484	10388966	I found Game Boy games from the store.
10388986	10390647	The games aren't actually in there, it's just the boxes.
10390987	10391788	And whatever this is.
10392600	10393921	It's conversion for the mouse.
10393981	10395083	Anyway, moving on.
10396484	10398306	Let's see what's in Rob's drawers.
10398586	10398906	No.
10401549	10402910	More than Jake wants to know.
10402971	10404392	I'm not going to tell the dead baby joke.
10404412	10405333	That was so two weeks ago.
10405773	10407095	What would you do for a Klondike bar?
10408636	10410438	Um, go to the store and buy one.
10410478	10413300	I know, go to the store, put a dollar on the counter and say, Give me a Klondike bar!
10413600	10413980	Bitch!
10414901	10415041	Ah.
10415481	10416863	I know you got a Klondike bar!
10417183	10417943	And nice titties!
10418904	10420946	I have sex with a very fine Asian woman.
10421986	10427831	DDArk, DDArkoholic wants to know, boxers... Oh, you found the ferret!
10430273	10431714	Yay, we have found the ferret.
10431834	10432134	Hooray.
10432775	10434416	It was way up there, it almost fell behind the thing.
10434876	10437038	Uh, DDArkoholic wants to know, boxers or briefs?
10437418	10438139	We'll start with Jamie.
10439973	10440494	What do you like?
10440654	10441375	No, what do you like to wear?
10441936	10442737	I'm just kidding.
10443778	10446241	Nothing.
10446541	10455813	I don't know, I like... I would say in general, I prefer briefs on a guy, because they show more.
10457335	10459337	Oh, the boxers need more accessibility.
10459817	10465282	Oh, there was this one time where my friend's boyfriend was asleep in her bed in her dorm room.
10466183	10469465	And I turned back to say something to her and his flight was totally open.
10470446	10472908	I was like, you need to leave him because he's really tight.
10474169	10475070	Oh my god!
10475170	10477012	I used to go in their dorm room and sniff the air.
10478053	10479474	And I was like, oh, you just got done.
10479554	10480255	I'm going out now.
10485663	10491210	No, I would go in, it would be like in the morning, I would go in and say hi, because I would just go over there and hang out.
10491591	10495576	But if it had that particular sponsor.
10495717	10496658	This smells like humping.
10496738	10497980	Moving on, who wants to go next?
10501149	10502110	I wear both, actually.
10502170	10503031	Not at the same time.
10503312	10503992	That'd be weird.
10505054	10505674	It just depends.
10506115	10516727	Boxers are comfortable to sleeve in and stuff, but when you're playing DDR or something like that, you don't exactly want... I don't like boxers because they end up riding up into your ass.
10517287	10520391	Especially when you're working out or some shit like that.
10520491	10521452	That pisses me off.
10522673	10525615	But then again, more accessibility, that's always good.
10526696	10530458	And my girlfriend looks hot in boxers.
10530618	10533900	Actually, women look hot in boxers.
10534040	10539003	Remember the 80s, though, when it was really popular for girls to wear men's boxers?
10539143	10540844	It's still popular, man.
10540904	10542705	Boxers and a short cut-off shirt.
10542965	10543445	Oh, yeah.
10543605	10549049	I have to say, though, that getting an oversized pair of men's boxers are the most comfortable thing to sleep in.
10549069	10550309	Really comfortable.
10551030	10551430	Moving on.
10553806	10560849	Okay, um, on me, I particularly like boxers, but on a girl, see, I'd have to flip it around, and I would say Kong.
10560889	10561789	That's all I got to say.
10563770	10569112	Um... To that note, what's so good about walking around with a wedgie?
10570252	10570533	Okay.
10572073	10574694	Uh, as for me, neither!
10575054	10575735	Ha ha ha!
10576295	10580116	No, um, boxers, you get wedgies too easily, so reason.
10580196	10580837	Or boxer reason.
10582580	10585621	I'll go ahead and speak for Dan, because I'm sure he would say this.
10585641	10585881	Yep.
10586462	10590663	He wears briefs, because he prefers security.
10591444	10592664	But they make these boxer briefs.
10593905	10594525	And those are cool.
10594725	10594985	Yep.
10595145	10596506	Because you get the best of both worlds.
10596526	10597346	I don't know.
10598027	10603509	But, um, but as far as now women's underwear thing, thongs suck!
10605729	10611050	Yeah, so I'm going to flip around the question and ask DD Archaholic, granny panties or thongs?
10613391	10615671	There is a wide variety of women's underwear.
10615711	10616411	Yeah, I know, I know.
10616431	10618051	See, for guys, it's usually either or.
10618411	10622532	But for women, there are so many choices because, you know, we need more choices.
10622852	10623633	We're complex.
10624933	10625953	All right, let's go on to the next question.
10625973	10629034	You know, buying underwear has to be a monumental decision.
10633328	10633889	Alright, moving on.
10634310	10637978	EOSFVB, do all women have bust sizes that are even numbers?
10638058	10641225	Because I recall somebody mentioning that bras only come in even numbers.
10643345	10645646	This is funny, because think back to the last question.
10646566	10652648	Like, briefs only come in even numbers, too, and boxers and pants only come in even numbers as well.
10652708	10654248	So the waist sizes are usually... Underwear.
10654508	10659050	Underwear comes in single numbers, 6, 7, 8, etc.
10659890	10661591	Boss sizes, though, are only in even numbers.
10662271	10664191	Pant sizes are not only in even numbers.
10664512	10666492	If they are juniors, they are in odd numbers.
10666812	10668813	If they are misses, they come in even numbers.
10669353	10674817	And boxers and briefs and stuff, they're normally like 36 to 38 or something like that.
10675117	10676278	Because they're elastic, right?
10677239	10680761	Okay, but what about bras, bras specifically?
10681502	10682122	I hate underwear.
10682202	10682963	They're all even, right?
10684704	10688186	Okay, I want to know.
10688867	10690087	Of course, you've got two.
10690148	10690488	Hello?
10692179	10694340	I want to know why they have double D and not E
10712003	10715287	But they do sell bra sizes up to G because I was watching Geraldo.
10716308	10720413	And these women were like... Geraldo's been cancelled for like... This was a while back.
10720454	10721074	This was a while back.
10721375	10724098	These women were on this show with these just humongous knockers.
10724799	10729044	And they had them... No, I mean they were like the size of watermelons.
10730226	10730406	Yes.
10732253	10735397	And they... You all need to see this.
10736018	10740143	But no, they were novelty models and they were all, you know, normally sized bodies.
10740624	10741945	Some of them were actually too small.
10742466	10747052	But they had their breasts enlarged to this humongous size.
10748253	10749415	They look like a bad doujinshi.
10750265	10753106	Okay, I don't understand with women getting that kind of thing.
10753146	10754366	You know what I don't understand?
10754526	10758107	And I keep seeing these on stupid porno pop-up ads.
10758167	10762929	What is up with the freaking, you know, monster cock thing, okay?
10763469	10768290	Why do they Photoshop, like, you know, zoomed-in versions of cocks on these normal people?
10768310	10769170	Because it looks stupid.
10769210	10770731	They have the same thing with, like, uh...
10771791	10784593	You know, like, also with women getting these breast sizes that are like larger than D or double D and shit, like V or, I don't even know how high it goes, but it's like, you get more breast mass than you do actual, you know, woman.
10785173	10795175	Yeah, it's almost, I don't know, like, I was sort of watching some of those talk shows for a while, and it's like, I think after a while they just start making up letters and numbers, so I'd like a QQRJ3.
10796995	10797275	Alright.
10797696	10799916	Well, you know, there's one other thing, though, about that,
10801219	10804900	Down the line, those women are going to have some serious back problems.
10805160	10807901	Serious back problems.
10807941	10809821	They're going to be tripping over their own boobs when they're 80.
10810162	10813442	Okay, I've got to get things moving here because we're almost to the end of the show.
10813522	10814403	Three more questions.
10814483	10814823	No more.
10814983	10816083	Don't send us any more questions.
10816143	10817324	We've got the last three right here.
10817424	10817804	Here we go.
10817904	10821365	Stresso wants to know, Hey Jamie, how about ice cream on dick?
10821485	10821885	Too sticky.
10822805	10822905	Yes.
10822925	10822965	No.
10822985	10823265	It's just you.
10823285	10823605	No, Naoki's both.
10823625	10824125	And everything.
10824145	10824546	And nothing.
10841098	10841758	I guess this is a good one.
10841778	10843839	I'll let one more in because this is a good one to end things on.
10843919	10846259	MoreThanJake543 wants to know why.
10846279	10847300	I guess I said so.
10848460	10848900	Beautiful.
10848960	10850541	Hello, ice cream on a penis.
10850641	10852041	Okay, it's cold.
10852481	10856502	Okay, it doesn't like the... How about a hot fudge sundae?
10856522	10858363	That's fucking hot.
10858543	10858943	Hello.
10859783	10861344	That's like pouring coffee on your dick.
10862244	10867245	The whole purpose of foreplay, the whole purpose of foreplay, correct me if I'm wrong, is to get the dick hard.
10868146	10869106	So it can do the job.
10870329	10871610	It doesn't cold make it shrink?
10871650	10874351	Hello, I want to know, why would you need an excuse sandwich?
10874551	10882553	Sweetie, that works both ways, though, because, you know, to get the cock and the mmm, haha, you need to get the haha little, you need to get things going down there, you know what I mean?
10883034	10885274	Well, yes, I mean, but I mean... You need to turn on the sprinklers.
10886035	10887495	But I mean in terms of dick.
10888896	10892717	The purpose is, and for a guy, the purpose is to get the dick hard, right?
10894469	10895670	Isn't ice cream to feed that?
10896171	10897132	It seriously would.
10897552	10899094	Unless you're going for rigor mortis.
10899254	10906181	I don't know if things have changed since the last time I've had sex, because it's been a while, so they might have changed things, but last time, I do remember those were the rules.
10906815	10914778	Last time I checked, I didn't bring in, like, a whole bunch of, like, condiments and fucking dessert items into the bedroom and shit.
10915078	10919259	I mean, first of all, okay, let's just say, say you're getting up to that point where you're going to put ice cream on the penis.
10919339	10923541	You have the ice cream sitting there on the side of the bed or whatever, melting away, like, dribbling all over.
10923561	10925161	You know how much of a mess it's going to make?
10925201	10925862	Holy shit.
10927082	10927822	I know, seriously.
10928182	10929403	What if it's a flavor you don't like?
10929523	10931724	I know, it's like your favorite flavor, and it's just melted on the floor.
10931924	10932724	It's kind of pointless.
10933163	10935004	Alright, it's time to wrap up the show.
10935044	10942030	We're going way over, and the fortune cookie message is three and a half minutes tonight, too, which doesn't help, so we're going for a record here, but that's okay.
10944151	10944631	Final thoughts?
10945692	10945952	Jamie?
10946313	10947273	Don't put ice cream on dick.
10948134	10948474	Zero.
10949115	10950015	What kind of propel do you like?
10950075	10950756	I almost bought you some.
10951556	10951677	Peach.
10951697	10951857	Okay.
10952357	10952597	Peach.
10953398	10953678	Loki?
10955359	10958622	The audience is way too young to be hearing this stuff.
10959482	10960463	That's all I gotta say.
10960976	10964217	and my final thought is the audience is horny.
10965278	10965578	Thank you.
10965638	10965958	Good night.
10966618	10967679	Thanks for listening to Orange Lounge.

10973821	10974902	Don't forget next week, Drunk Show.
10975502	10977103	Whore up our listening hours, please.
10977788	10978729	Drunk Show next week.
10978829	10979530	I will not be here.
10980070	10982972	Oh, my God, we didn't even announce these other things that we're going to do.
10982992	10985895	The long version lunches and the long version late nights.
10986756	10989658	Every day from noon to 1 and from midnight to 1 a.m.

10990739	10991880	That starts this week.
10992180	10995103	That starts February 12th here on the station.
10995583	10997505	So be sure to give me your CDs by then.
10997585	10998085	February 12th.
10998105	11000227	Next week's special guest, Shrek's Girl.
11000567	11004730	Also, we're kind of cramming this all in at the last minute.
11005051	11010094	Don't forget, required logins to Live365.com starts on February 13th.
11010455	11014298	If you access the station directly through Winamp, you're not going to be able to do that anymore.
11014338	11015779	This was not our decision.
11016219	11019361	This is something that Live365 is doing to all of their stations.
11019702	11026047	If you're afraid of signing up for a registration because you're going to get spam, I suggest you sign up for a Hotmail account, just a dummy account, and send it.
11026207	11026487	I know.
11026847	11033091	I don't endorse spam at all, but Live365 swears up and down they will not sell your email address to spammers.
11034352	11036514	Yeah, and Zero says he hasn't gotten anything.
11036674	11038255	I don't get anything, so I do believe it.
11038615	11043478	They're just wanting your age and that stuff so they can track, hey, 18-year-olds like to listen to Orange Lounge Radio or whatever.
11043738	11047381	Gosh, we have a lot of 12-year-olds listening to this station that talks about pornography.
11047621	11049963	They won't sell your, you know, name.
11050363	11056607	But here's what they'll do is they'll go ahead and give them to the companies and then have the companies leave the money in the normal drop spot.
11057107	11059570	And Tuesday we have a possibility of a fuck-off show for me.
11073086	11074627	Cool, Tuesday Possibility of a Fuck Off show.
11074947	11077668	In a couple weeks, we will have the CyberBeat special.
11078069	11082811	We're going to do a whole special for the CyberBeat Nation trip that I'm going on this next week while I'm not going to be on the show.
11082831	11090355	We're going to do a whole special, a couple hours, maybe an hour or two, I don't know yet, of just interviews, journal things, and who knows what.
11090575	11091055	It'll be fun.
11091476	11092676	So we'll be airing that soon.
11093197	11096999	Okay, that was all the Orange Lounge news crammed into about two minutes.
11097059	11098820	Stay tuned for the afterbirth.

11135068	11137410	Other things just make you swear and curse.
11138851	11143835	When you're chewing on life's gristle, that grumble, give a whistle.

11191638	11219629	Always look on the bright side of life For life is quite absurd and death's the final word You must always face the curtain with a veil Forget about your seat, give the audience a grin Enjoy it, it's your last chance anyhow So always look on the bright side of death
11223486	11251825	Just before you draw your terminal breath Life's a piece of shit when you look at it Life's a laugh and death's a joke, it's true You'll see it's all a show, keep on laughing as you go Just remember that the last laugh is on you And always look on the bright side of life
