Loki, I can't for the life of me get the hooker to have sex with me.

00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:36,240
Orange Lounge Radio.

21
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:44,240
We are live, and this is episode number 34 for February the 23rd of 2003.

22
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:48,240
You're tuned into the Maimani Scene's most angsty radio station of all things Maimani.

23
00:01:48,240 --> 00:02:01,240
My name is Rob Roberts, you might know me as Sky. Joining me as always are my awesome co-hosts, in this corner, the happiest bunny on the Happy Tree Friend Farm, Miss Jamie Summers.

24
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:08,240
You know her better as Dark Sakura. Makes Captain Jack cry.

25
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:15,240
Also, in this corner, say hello to our tech master, Loki.

26
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:21,240
I think they're having a hard time hearing you guys tonight, so be sure to be nice.

27
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:25,240
Beautiful.

28
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:32,240
Excuse me. Also in studio tonight, say hello to... Zero's back!

29
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:39,240
He's going to end up being like Loki. He's just going to show up for every week until we decide to add him on.

30
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:43,240
No, no, it's cool. It's cool. We're just fucking with you.

31
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:49,240
I thought she was waving hello. Was that a hello or goodbye? I hate English.

32
00:02:54,240 --> 00:03:00,240
You know what? They're thinking that that might be a dead mic. Hold on. We're having some technical difficulties. Let's try this again real fast.

33
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:06,700
real fast. Here, use my mic. God dammit. The show's falling apart already. Alright, go

34
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:08,920
around and introduce yourselves one more time with a mic that works and I'll figure out

35
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:25,920
what's going on with the other one. Alright, I will. I'm not eating. Hi. Can you hear me

36
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:29,920
Can you hear me now? Can you hear me? Yes, I fucked up. God.

37
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:34,920
Alright, let's try this again. Should we just, let's just try this whole thing again. Let's have a do-over.

38
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:36,920
Hey!

39
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:38,920
Dark Sakura. Shut up!

40
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:41,920
Where's my gun? This is my boomstick.

41
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:44,920
Sky. Come on girls, it's time to drop the bomb.

42
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:48,920
Loki. I can't, for the life of me, get the hooker to have sex with me.

43
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:51,920
What kind of war human being would find that funny?

44
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:55,920
Orange Lounge Radio

00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:25,080

60
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:15,640
semi-annual diapers

61
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:21,640
You know, Walgreens has some depends-on-sale half fries.

62
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:25,640
You could just put, like, teals on my shoes.

63
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:26,640
Then you'd have Heelys.

64
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:30,640
But that's not funny. How about a training bra?

65
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:33,640
He'd have to wear it on his head and go around and do it.

66
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:35,640
I have a picture of Mel B with panties on his head.

67
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:37,640
I saw that picture.

68
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:40,640
I'm sorry, but you just made me think it's an understation joke.

69
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:41,640
Oh, what's that?

70
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:44,640
If you wore the bra on his head, it'd be Queen Amidala.

71
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:46,760
clean up about

72
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:50,620
and that is because i have to listen under station like dot org back up and

73
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:53,420

00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:19,940
We'll be talking about Cyberbeat tonight, the big tourney that happened in SoCal for a little bit.

84
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:22,940
We got some clips from the interviews and stuff. That'll be fun.

85
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:25,940
Don't be able to be paid out of vinegar.

86
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:27,940
Rob, do you feel about so fresh?

87
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:32,940

88
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:33,940

89
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:35,940

Hi, this is Melby of RTF. Looking for an extra $1.99 a minute, my girlfriend Melby can join us on all the fun together.

106
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:15,740
Hey, if you're a broke-ass like I am, why don't you come to the one place that costs absolutely nothing to go to and still the fun is just as great.

107
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:23,740
It's Orange Lounge Radio, Sunday nights. Kick it with me and you just might realize the best things in life are free.

00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:30,740
Um, yeah.

00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:36,740
Contrary to popular belief with the whole switching over to Live 365, you have to be registered now to listen to our station.

111
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:42,740
Which, obviously, if you're hearing us right now, you must be registered and tuning in.

112
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:49,740
But if you know somebody that's trying to get in that can't, you have to remind them that they have to now be signed up through Live365.com.

Registration is absolutely 100% free and they've promised us they will not spam your email.

114
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:57,100
email but if you're nervous about that kind of stuff

115
00:13:57,100 --> 00:14:00,660
i think it's a good internet policy to just have a hotmail yahoo a free email

116
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:03,420
account you just send anything

117
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:05,980
you can't guard yeah yahoo spam guards excellent

118
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:06,960
anything uses

119
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:08,760
suspect might be spamming you

120
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:12,260
send it over one of those i would like to go and there's a little it

121
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:16,140
i think i get like two hundred fifty messages that day well

122
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:18,800
tangency i know some people to get so much

123
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:21,620
yahoo spam but i'd hardly get any

124
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:27,620
It's all sent to my trash, but see the thing is it doesn't empty fast enough. I have to go in there and empty my trash like six times a day.

125
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:32,620
Because after like one day I'll see that there's 75 messages in trash.

126
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:33,620
There's a bulk folder.

127
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:37,620
Yeah, 75 messages in trash, 26 in bulk, and like 2 in my other one.

128
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:43,620
And the 2, they're actually in my inbox. Both are spam.

129
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:45,620
You know you can block the addresses.

130
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:48,620
I've already have 100 blocked addresses.

131
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:50,620
Jeez.

132
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:53,700
it's spammers are so high-tech nowadays that they're

133
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:57,340
they change their driving their email you from a new address each time see if

134
00:14:57,340 --> 00:14:59,140
you block it they just go to you know

135
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:02,580
say you're getting spammed from low key one then they'll just go to look at you

136
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:03,500
and look at three

137
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:07,100
one I'm started in as block you can block domains on there also

138
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:14,660
block AOL just kidding okay so but you know that they're thinking about pass

139
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:16,620
along california makes them totally legal

140
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:20,140
which would be cool course junk mail still legal

141
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:24,020
But you can also, if I remember right, you can go to the post office

142
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:27,380
and request that they not give you any junk mail and they'll do it.

143
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:31,020
But that means you don't get like the cards for the missing kids or any of that stuff.

144
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:31,980
You don't get anything.

145
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:35,820
One thing though that should be, people should realize,

146
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:39,580
if you want a lot of that information when you get into and don't want telemarketer

147
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:41,340
calls, whenever a telemarketer calls you

148
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:45,700
tell them to opt you out. It is a federal privacy law.

149
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:49,740
I work for a mortgage company now. I used to work in customer service for one. Tell them to opt you out.

150
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:53,260
out if you have a mortgage if you live with people who have a mortgage tell

151
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:58,740
them to have their servicer opt you out of all outside communication not to

152
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:05,580
share your information call the three credit bureau reporting trying to

153
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:11,140
remember what they are off the top of my head there's a Equifax there's one of

154
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:15,260
them Equifax yeah Equifax there's two others but I don't remember off the top of my

155
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:19,380
head but you can also write your credit bureaus and have them not share your

156
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:21,180
information, because that's the primary way they get it.

157
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:24,300
I was going to say, a lot of people also know it as the

158
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:25,260
don't call list.

159
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:27,060
If you tell a telemarketer to put you on the don't call

160
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:27,980
list, then they have to.

161
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:30,820
Otherwise, that's regular law.

162
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:31,980
Yep.

163
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:36,340
But that right there, since we used to get about two, three

164
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:40,180
telemarketer calls a night sometimes, I called one of

165
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:41,740
them and said, opt us out.

166
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:43,940
We didn't get a single one for the next month.

167
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:46,820
And for junk mail, if you wanted, this is great.

168
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:51,180
Matt X from his wonderful site recommended this.

169
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:53,700
When you get those credit card applications in the mail,

170
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:57,460
take your junk mail, stick them in the nice little prepaid

171
00:16:57,460 --> 00:17:00,580
envelope given to you by the credit card mailer,

172
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:02,500
and look, you got rid of your junk mail

173
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:05,020
and the stupid credit card companies

174
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:08,660
stop mailing you because you're sending them back junk mail.

175
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:11,780
You can also just write three lovely words

176
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:14,060
on top of every last bit of that junk mail.

177
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:16,540
Return to sender.

178
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:20,540
it works?

179
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:24,540
Theceased is great. When you're at theceased, you don't get it mailed anymore.

180
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:28,540
I've done that with a couple of them, but it works.

181
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:32,540
That's messed up, but funny. Wasn't that an old 80's song, Returns?

182
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:36,540
I guess. I don't know, anyway.

183
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:40,540
Chat room's kind of dead right now. I'm starting to wonder if I pinged out, because I'm not seeing anything. Of course, our chat room's been having

184
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:44,540
some issues all day. Other side IRC. Oh, there we go, we have some

185
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:48,920
some chatting going on now. It's alive! It's alive, it's alive. IRC has been kind of broken

186
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:53,520
half the day today, so I think it's all better now, but just in case, go ahead. There's a

187
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:57,680
big bandaid on it. If you're not being able to get in through your normal means, go ahead

188
00:17:57,680 --> 00:18:03,980
and go to our Java page at orangelounge.skie.cx, click on Chat, and use the Java applet, because

189
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:11,560
the server that the Java applet points to works fine. So you can use that. Cool, huh?

190
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:15,200
Jamie brought treats. What kind of treats did you bring tonight?

191
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:21,080
Shrimp chips. Because every snack I get has to have some kind of connotation.

192
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:25,240
So I got shrimp chips this time. And sweet potato chips.

193
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:29,120
I don't like shrimp chips. I mean they're okay but they just

194
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:33,120
they're so weird to me. Like when I eat shrimp I expect to be eating

195
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:38,120
like Long John Silver's ghetto deep-fried shrimp.

196
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:46,680
shimpy. They don't really taste like shrimp. They smell like ass, actually. They smell

197
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:52,400
like rank pussy, that's what it smells like. They're yummy. Damn it, I like pussy. I mean,

198
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:59,120
please. So how was the, uh, how was the drunk show last week? I wasn't, I wasn't here to

199
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:04,560
experience it, unfortunately, but, um, this is something EOSFBB gave me a link to, I'll

200
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:05,840
I'll get to it in a minute.

201
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,800
Well, how did things go last week?

202
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:08,760
I was drunk.

203
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:09,520
I haven't listened to it.

204
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:10,760
How drunk did you guys get?

205
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:11,280
Not very.

206
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,600
Not me, anyway.

207
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:14,920
Melody was really silly.

208
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:16,160
I just got, like, drunk.

209
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:18,800
OK, this is what I had.

210
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:25,400
I had about four things of, actually, I drank out

211
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:29,560
of this flask of, what was that, Dutch chocolate liqueur

212
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:30,640
that Melody bought?

213
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:31,140
Kahlua?

214
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:31,640
No.

215
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:32,440
No.

216
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:34,440
It's Dutch chocolate, so really good chocolate.

217
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:40,120
chocolate liqueur. I had a few swallows of that out of a flask.

218
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:42,480
Were you drinking straight out of the bottle?

219
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:44,800
That's ghetto.

220
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:48,960
I made this drink with vanilla soy milk and Godiva liqueur.

221
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,620
No, this one brand of soy milk.

222
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:51,700
I'm making a face.

223
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:56,180
This one brand of soy milk, you can't even tell it's soy milk. It's very creamy, like real milk.

224
00:19:56,180 --> 00:19:57,300
Mmm, creamy.

225
00:19:57,300 --> 00:20:03,480
I do, I do, I do.

226
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:06,800
But it was, I had like four of those or something.

227
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:10,480
And then I had a shot of vodka.

228
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:13,200
No, it wasn't vodka, I had a shot of rum.

229
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:18,200
I had three of those,

230
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:24,280
this Mernoff Ice Triple Blacks.

231
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:26,600
Ooh, those are so good, mmm, yum, yum, yum.

232
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:30,160
Did anyone get super crazy or naked or super, no?

233
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:33,840
Ross brought a 40 of St. Ives.

234
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:36,960
No, but the show went south when I brought my video over.

235
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:40,040
Yeah, everyone went downstairs to watch this video right here.

236
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:43,840
The Ron Jeremy porn star video?

237
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:48,160
Yay! Yeah, I want to see it. I heard about it.

238
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:51,880
How exciting.

239
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:54,880
I always wanted to see a man kiss his own penis. Not really.

240
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:58,640
Not you.

241
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:04,560
I just did this little, this little jerk motion that made me look like I was about to do it

242
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:06,560
and shame I got scared.

243
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:09,200
What are these, sweet potato chips?

244
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,200
Let's read the back.

245
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:14,780
Sweet potato chips is made with sweet potato and made of golden crunch, containing no preservatives

246
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:16,200
and no cholesterol.

247
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:18,400
It's an ideal snack for all ages.

248
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,960
Eat some!

249
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:20,960
Eat it!

250
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:21,960
Eat it!

251
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:22,960
Well?

252
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:27,400
Well, they're okay.

253
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:29,400
They're no Pringles, but they're good.

254
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:30,400
They're better.

255
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,720
They may not have sweet potatoes and they're yummy.

256
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:33,920
What happened with Match Game?

257
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:35,640
People in the shower room were talking about Match Game.

258
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:38,640
We kept talking about Run, Jeremy.

259
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:39,640
Jesus.

260
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:41,280
I didn't save it, unfortunately.

261
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:47,960
Oh, speaking of kissing penis, the OSFBB wanted me to share this article with you all.

262
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:48,960
Mr. Spanky!

263
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:49,960
Mr. Spanky!

264
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:52,200
Oh, you want Mr. Spanky to do it?

265
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:58,200
Alright, we'll get Mr. Spanky in here. Hold on. We gotta call Mr. Spanky. Jamie, call Mr. Spanky.

266
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:05,200
Beep, beep, beep, beep. Mr. Spanky!

267
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,200
That was retarded.

268
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:08,200
Yes it was.

269
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:11,200
Then why don't you call Mr. Spanky?

270
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:14,200
What the fuck? No.

271
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:16,200
I'll do it all night.

272
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:21,200
Paging Mr. Spanky. Mr. Spanky, you have a call at the front desk.

273
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:30,680
we have a winner mr. Spanky would now like to read you this article it's

274
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:37,360
called teens asked to consider oral sex in London school children under 16 are

275
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:42,400
being encouraged to experiment with oral sex as part of a government-backed drive

276
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:46,880
to cut Britain's sky-high teenage pregnancy rate the time said the scheme

277
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:50,000
pioneered by a university and backed by the Department of Health and Education

278
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:57,040
Education, trains teachers to discuss pre-sex stopping points.

279
00:22:57,040 --> 00:23:02,240
The idea is to reduce promiscuity by encouraging pupils to discover levels of intimacy, including

280
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:05,700
oral sex, instead of full sexual intercourse.

281
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:09,460
But family campaigners condemned the accord, saying it would only encourage children to

282
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:15,420
experiment with sex.

283
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:17,940
The director of the Family Education Trust told the newspaper,

284
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:22,940
I don't think that anyone believes that teaching people about oral sex will stop them from having full sex

285
00:23:23,060 --> 00:23:28,060
It's more likely to make them want to try it. It doesn't protect them against sexually transmitted diseases

286
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:33,900
Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah

287
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:40,340
Oh Britain has the highest teenage pregnancy rate in Western Europe. The government has a set target of having levels by 2010

288
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:42,900
Bye

289
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:45,380
No

290
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:46,380
Ah!

291
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:49,260
Yes, that was a fun article, wasn't it?

292
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:50,260
This is coming from Yahoo!

293
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:51,260
News.

294
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:54,460
The same people that also brought us a wonderful article a couple of days ago about the Congo

295
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:56,060
teachers who are, um...

296
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:59,060
Is this about the Ebola virus or something?

297
00:23:59,060 --> 00:24:00,060
The Ebola spell.

298
00:24:00,060 --> 00:24:01,060
Yeah, the Congo teachers...

299
00:24:01,060 --> 00:24:03,060
I put a spell on you!

300
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:07,140
...were stoned to death for casting the Ebola spell.

301
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:09,260
I wanted to read some of the Yahoo!

302
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:10,940
Talkbacks here, because Yahoo!

303
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:12,620
There's nothing better on Yahoo!

304
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:13,620
News than Yahoo!

305
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:14,620
Talkbacks.

306
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:22,300
some juice let's see oh we have God is the answer I think that it's terrible

307
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:27,540
they should teach them about God the station folk thus should focus this guy's

308
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:31,380
got a great education here thus should focus and what the Bible says want to

309
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:39,460
give a good advice get it from the Bible that sounds like English yeah I'm sorry

310
00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:45,860
would you say zero? He was educated in Britain. God is the answer. Let's see, let's look at

311
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:48,620
Reid, God is the answer. You could have been saying, you know, dog is the answer, but you

312
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:57,380
know, we wouldn't know. Let's see, God is the answer. None of these replies are any

313
00:24:57,380 --> 00:25:02,780
good. I also think it's terrible that they should teach them about God. Religion in school

314
00:25:02,780 --> 00:25:07,820
doesn't mix, but sex ed is a real issue, not some religious one. Let's see, what else is

315
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:42,840
Well, let's see...

316
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:45,100
Lucky be the man who's skilled at hand.

317
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:51,800
All right, thank you for bringing this show down to a whole new level, you know, Speeby!

318
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:54,920
Ah, sorry I had to burp there.

319
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:59,260
Oh, it's weird, being gone for a week, and having to come back it's like I feel

320
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:01,420
like I haven't done this for like a whole month.

321
00:26:01,420 --> 00:26:03,200
Oh, yeah...

322
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:06,840
Anything else of interest happen last week, Loggy?

323
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:08,840
Okay.

324
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:11,840
No, um, I don't know.

325
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:14,840
I want more metal pads off of eBay.

326
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:18,840
Oh, you know what? I'm going to be giving away. I'm going to, um...

327
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:23,840
I'm going to get these. My friend Matt is going to give them to me for free. My other friend Matt's going to give them to me for free.

328
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:27,840
And I think we might do some kind of giveaway. It's going to have to be more local giveaway.

329
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:29,840
They're wannabe ignition pads.

330
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:32,840
They're not ignition pads, but they're the knockoff wannabe kind.

331
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:35,840
And I don't really have a use for them, so I think we're going to do some kind of giveaway.

332
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:38,840
I just don't know how yet, because I can't afford to ship them to anybody.

333
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:41,840
So they're going to have to be some kind of local giveaway. I don't know.

334
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:45,840
We should just hook them up and see how badly we can thrash them.

335
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:48,840
Oh, you just want to beat them up on air?

336
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:52,840
We could dissect a wannabe ignition pad live on air. That would be fun.

337
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:56,840
No, that's stupid. I've done it before.

338
00:26:56,840 --> 00:27:01,840
Oh, we could set it on fire, except we have no place to set it on fire at.

339
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:02,840
Okay, here.

340
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:03,840
That smells good.

341
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:04,840
What is that?

342
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:06,960
It looks like blood.

343
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:08,380
It looks like blood.

344
00:27:08,380 --> 00:27:10,240
Jamie brought blood back here.

345
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:14,840
That's cranberry grape?

346
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:16,840
Anyway.

347
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:22,120
Is cranberry apple Martinelli's?

348
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:24,360
You know giant Matt, right?

349
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:26,640
Giant Matt's giving me two wannabe ignition pads.

350
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:29,000
They're not ignition pads, they're the wannabe ones.

351
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,780
Some third party ignition pads.

352
00:27:30,780 --> 00:27:31,780
I don't know.

353
00:27:31,780 --> 00:27:39,080
some kind of giveaway. You just want me to give them to you? Why don't I give you one

354
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:43,740
and then we can give the other one away? Okay. But we can't afford for shipping, although

355
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:47,100
some people are saying they'll pay for shipping. Well, we'll think it's some kind of contest.

356
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:54,940
Maybe we can do something. How about the DWI contest? Okay. Okay. Okay, so that's going

357
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:58,580
to be part of the prize for the DWI contest. I like what you think. I like the way this

358
00:27:58,580 --> 00:28:05,480
women things. That's because I think. Alright. I think, therefore I am. I think. We're all

359
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:09,040
going to be, I was thinking we could do some kind of giveaway at B3, some kind of random

360
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:12,020
door prize or something, I don't know though how that's all going to work. B3 details are

361
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:17,180
still being formed, although that is happening in May. May something through 17th, I don't

362
00:28:17,180 --> 00:28:21,420
know what it is, sometime in May. I have an announcement. You have an announcement? Whoo-hoo!

363
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:25,620
Announcements, announcement. Alright, give your announcement. We have a date set on the

364
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:31,940
date of March 29th and March 30th. A tournament, more usually, held in the Bay Area is going

365
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:39,520
to be held at Scandia in Sacramento. March Madness! Yay! We'll have details up on that

366
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:43,380
and by next week we should be able to give people links to where the rules are and all

367
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:49,620
that information. But be prepared, this one is not going to be just Perfect Attack. This

368
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:54,080
one is also going to be Freestyle and Freestyle will be rather unique. Can you tell us more

369
00:28:54,080 --> 00:29:00,400
about that at this time all I have to say is I've heard the proposition that

370
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:05,080
they're doing for freestyle it is gonna kick so much ass this is really funny

371
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:09,360
because on the drive down to SoCal we were talking about the exact same thing

372
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:14,240
and I said I want to see that happen in Sacramento and lo and behold it's gonna

373
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:21,440
awesome so once again March Madness March 29th and 30th Sacramento scandia

374
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:24,440
Sacramento Scandia, be here or die.

375
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:26,440
Or we'll kick your ass.

376
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:27,840
That's it.

377
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:31,240
More details forthcoming, keep your eyes on uh...

378
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:34,440
I don't know, I don't know if we'll get to be an affiliate of that, I'm sure.

379
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:36,440
Oh, Sacramento sucks.

380
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:41,440
Do you know what I do? I was just told that on Friday.

381
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:43,640
You were told that

382
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:45,600
by someone whose opinion doesn't count.

383
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:48,940
Oh yes. Anyway.

384
00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:51,540
Oh, you're already getting offers in the chatroom to help with the tournament.

385
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:54,140
Stay tuned to DDR Freak, we'll have a thread on it,

386
00:29:54,140 --> 00:29:56,140
Sakbamani will have a thread on it for sure.

387
00:29:56,140 --> 00:29:58,740
I will go ahead and say this, sir, we'll be meeting at my house

388
00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:01,840
for people who are in the area, or can make it to the area.

389
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:06,340
Just send me a private message on Sakbamani.com to DarkSakura

390
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:09,740
and I'll take any offers of assistance I can.

391
00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:14,340
Yes. Hopefully I'll be participating in that too as the...

392
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:18,540
Well, I can't say it. I can't say it till more details come out.

393
00:30:18,540 --> 00:30:19,540
The voice.

394
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:20,540
The voice.

395
00:30:20,540 --> 00:30:21,540
Okay.

396
00:30:21,540 --> 00:30:23,900
When more details come out, we'll be a little...

397
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:25,900
We won't be so dodgy.

398
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:26,900
You heard it here first.

399
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:27,900
Yes, you did.

400
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:28,900
Or second or third.

401
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:29,900
I don't know.

402
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:30,900
First.

403
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:31,900
Anyway, let's...

404
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:34,700
Speaking of tournaments, let's get to the Cyberbeat tape, shall we?

405
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:36,580
Let's hear some of the Cyberbeat stuff.

406
00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:37,580
Oh, God.

407
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:38,580
Oh, God.

408
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:39,580
We're just gonna hear...

409
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:40,580
What we're gonna do is we're gonna play some clips.

410
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:44,380
We're not gonna play because there's literally probably about an hour and a half of tape

411
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:47,460
from the Cyberbeat trip, from the L.A. trip.

412
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:49,620
However, a lot of it is very random.

413
00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:51,940
I swear to God, Wendell went off for 20 minutes

414
00:30:51,940 --> 00:30:54,840
telling us a story about Mike Noe, which is really funny,

415
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:56,340
but we just don't have the time to do that

416
00:30:56,340 --> 00:30:57,180
on this show right now.

417
00:30:57,180 --> 00:30:58,020
But you'll have to tune in to hear that.

418
00:30:58,020 --> 00:30:59,560
That's right, so if you wanna hear that,

419
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:02,820
you gotta tune in on Tuesday,

420
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:04,460
or I'm sorry, no, no, don't tune in on Tuesday.

421
00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:05,380
Well, tune in on Tuesday.

422
00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:06,780
Tune in all the time to Orange on the Radio.

423
00:31:06,780 --> 00:31:09,800
But tune in on Friday at seven o'clock Pacific time,

424
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:11,620
or Saturday at four o'clock Pacific time.

425
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:13,460
Those are the two times we're gonna be airing

426
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:14,960
the Cyber Beat full tapes.

427
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:16,580
But in the meantime, we're gonna play some clips for you,

428
00:31:16,580 --> 00:31:24,280
these are interviews that we did with some folks and the first set is it's

429

00:32:27,460 --> 00:32:30,900
freestyle routine that's gonna make you walk on a machine

452
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:32,980
to prosper for shooting

00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:34,940

00:32:34,940 --> 00:32:37,180

00:32:37,180 --> 00:32:38,580
yesterday when word

456
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:42,780
shit

457
00:32:42,780 --> 00:32:43,780
Big shades.

458
00:32:43,780 --> 00:32:47,860
What have you baby?

459
00:32:47,860 --> 00:32:48,860
Definitely important to see.

460
00:32:48,860 --> 00:32:50,660
Anything else you want to say to folks out there?

461
00:32:50,660 --> 00:32:52,740
Anything about the tournament or what have you?

462
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:56,860
The videos will speak for themselves.

463
00:32:56,860 --> 00:32:59,400
Let the videos speak for themselves.

464
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:00,400
More to come later.

465
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:03,420
I think we're going to have to interview after that routine.

466
00:33:03,420 --> 00:33:04,420
That's perfect.

467
00:33:04,420 --> 00:33:05,420
Alright, perfect.

468
00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:07,240
Come find me because I'm a lazy bastard.

469
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:08,620
I don't tape much for the show.

470
00:33:08,620 --> 00:33:09,620
Swear to God I will.

471
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:10,620
Alright, great.

472
00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:15,620
The videos won't truly get the whole feel of it.

473
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:18,620
I came to L.A. just for this, so...

474
00:33:18,620 --> 00:33:21,620
RTF domination, baby.

475
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:23,620
We shall see. Alright.

476
00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:30,620
If you do happen to listen to the Cyberbeat special on Friday or Saturday, listen to how many times Mel B whores out RTF.

477
00:33:30,620 --> 00:33:34,620
It's great. No, it's great to have a lot of pride. It's cool.

478
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:37,620
And Wendell does horror on Step Squad quite a bit, so...

479
00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:39,620
I'm back later.

480
00:33:39,620 --> 00:33:47,800
It's 5 30 p.m. On Saturday and PA's finally finished. It's all over and I am standing here with the winner say hello everybody to Tigger Eugene

481
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:52,220
Hey, what's up? So how how intense was that last match pretty?

482
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:57,080
What it's pretty hard I guess tiring yeah tiring board

483
00:33:57,080 --> 00:34:00,920
I don't know. I know the last match was kind of like weird

484
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:03,780
How many songs did you have to play in that last match? I was keeping count

485
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:06,300
What was the toughest one? What's the toughest one for you?

486
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:13,300
It must have been paranoia, because I think that's the song I really messed up on, Paranoid Survivor, or Survivor Eternal.

487
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:19,300
Did you train for this at all? Did you practice a lot? How do you do to prepare yourself for something like this?

488
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:24,300
I went to MGL every day for two weeks, something like that.

489
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:30,300
You're pretty well known to NorCal, at least, for being the PA guy that seems to walk away on the first ride to all the tournaments.

490
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:34,300
Did you do anything extra for this, being like it was going to be a big tournament?

491
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:38,460
What do you mean like it would do anything was there any like extra preparation like was it extra?

492
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:40,940
Were you extra nervous for this one or?

493
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:42,380
Yes

494
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:44,780
Was it just another was it just another day for jigger?

495
00:34:44,860 --> 00:34:47,020
I wasn't another day like I don't know getting kind of weird

496
00:34:47,020 --> 00:34:51,340
I felt like really good like paers and stuff and like I don't yeah that whole training every day thing

497
00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:55,180
That was like well, it's crazy any future tournaments you plan on attending

498
00:34:56,060 --> 00:35:00,140
I don't know any of any like coming up or except for one in seattle. I think my dad's taking me or something

499
00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:03,180
Now I know sure dad comes with you to all the tournaments. That's pretty cool

500
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:07,280
Like a lot of support a lot of support. Do you get a lot of support from your parents? Yeah, yeah

501
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:12,220
They don't they don't stand there and punish you if you do bad do you

502
00:35:13,860 --> 00:35:17,660
I'm just joking around of course not of course not, but that's awesome that they show up in this work

503
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:19,660
Do you do you ever watch the tapes?

504
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:23,220
What tapes like cuz I know if he taped sometimes? I don't know

505
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:24,060
Oh, yeah, yeah

506
00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:28,340
And it's cool cuz like people actually asked me for like copies and stuff sometimes because nobody ever tapes PA

507
00:35:28,340 --> 00:35:31,420
It's like PA ain't important. Nobody wants to take that stuff, but your dad does that's cool

508
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:36,420
Yeah, PA is not important. What you mean by that, man? Come on, man.

509
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:43,420
No, I mean, but you know, like, if you get on the Internet, there's all the freestyle videos, there's no PA videos. Hey, I'm a PA-er myself, except I was too lazy for this one.

510
00:35:43,420 --> 00:35:44,420
Yeah.

511
00:35:44,420 --> 00:35:46,420
Yeah.

512
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:49,420
So, anything else you want to say about the tournament? Thoughts for the day?

513
00:35:49,420 --> 00:35:54,420
I don't know. It was cool, because, like, the knockout people were, like, keeping me motivated, like, my girlfriend, and, like, um...

514
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:55,420
Who, Paul?

515
00:35:55,420 --> 00:36:00,540
window yeah when there is a man when the world it had on mike no

516
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:02,340

00:36:02,340 --> 00:36:04,220
good people in the air

518
00:36:04,220 --> 00:36:06,140
congratulations once again good job

519
00:36:06,140 --> 00:36:08,100

520
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:09,500
uh... use it

521
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:11,120

523
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:13,900
uh...

524
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:14,980
i don't know

525
00:36:14,980 --> 00:36:17,260
i don't know if i don't know if i could sort of

526
00:36:17,260 --> 00:36:20,500
so far and then i had a but the hundred and one of them

527
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:23,420
pretty hard to get over now so

528
00:36:23,420 --> 00:36:24,420
They don't make it anymore.

529
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:25,420
So, have fun with it.

530
00:36:25,420 --> 00:36:26,420
Thanks for being with us.

531
00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:30,580
Alright, so, I'm going to talk to some other folks that have gathered around here, so introduce

532
00:36:30,580 --> 00:36:35,580
yourselves for us, as one runs away.

533
00:36:35,580 --> 00:36:39,020
Come on, I know this guy's going to talk to us, aren't you?

534
00:36:39,020 --> 00:36:43,140
Hello guys, it's me, Bob Lombardi, the one and only, standing here with my partner and

535
00:36:43,140 --> 00:36:44,140
one mic.

536
00:36:44,140 --> 00:36:45,140
Boo-ner.

537
00:36:45,140 --> 00:36:48,100
Are you guys doing a couples routine today?

538
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:51,980
No, unfortunately, because Christy has a little stage fright, but it's all good, you know.

539
00:36:51,980 --> 00:36:52,980
It's just DDR.

540
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:57,480
It's only DDR, you know, it's only like, one of the biggest tournaments in SoCal, you know, it's nothing big.

541
00:36:57,480 --> 00:37:02,980
But you know, I mean, honestly, I'm just really glad to be here, cause a lot of things almost kept me from not coming today.

542
00:37:02,980 --> 00:37:04,980
But you know, I mean, what can you say?

543
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:05,980
Like i5?

544
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:08,480
BLEEP!

545
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:09,480
i5, alright.

546
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:09,980
BLEEP!

547
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:10,480
The cops on i5.

548
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:11,980
See, it's internet radio, you can say whatever you want.

549
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:12,980
Fuck the cops, alright?

550
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:16,480
Cause man, I swear to God, if they do that shit again, I just will bust their asses, man.

551
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:17,480
What happened, he got pulled over?

552
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:19,480
Oh my God, dude, we're fucking driving, right?

553
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:22,480
Everyone else is going the same speed and shit, and what does this fucking cop do?

554
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:27,520
You know you're going too fast, what about your family, bitch we're friends, we know

555
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:28,520
what the fuck we're doing.

556
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:32,480
So it's like fuck you cops, fuck you highway patrol, you hear that, you give me one more

557
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:36,000
motherfucking ticket, I'm gonna go like jahi on your asses, alright?

558
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:40,080
It's an F-you of the week, straight from Bob Lombardi, how about that?

559
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:43,520
So I noticed a lot of freestyles around here, they're kinda nervous, competition's a little

560
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:45,660
tight, what are your thoughts going into freestyle?

561
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:49,360
You know what, when I first came down here, I didn't give a fuck about freestyle, you

562
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:55,080
I figured I would just go up there, you know, improv something like I usually do, you know?

563
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:59,080
But then I started talking, you know, like, I mean, people like Wendell, you know, like,

564
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:04,980
Hypnotics, or Go, excuse me, you know, people like Bruce Leroy, Mel B, you know?

565
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:09,480
And it's like, you know, they're taking it hella seriously and stuff, and it's like,

566
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:12,080
you want to take it seriously, but you really don't, because-

567
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:13,280
How can you take a video game seriously?

568
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:16,880
Exactly, you know, because when you come back and you look at it, oh yeah, I won number

569
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:19,200
one at this tourney in SoCal, people will be like, what were you playing?

570
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:22,500
I was like, man, I was playing Dance Dance Revolution, and I'm like, what?

571
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:27,040
I had to draw figures for my coworkers to make them understand what it was exactly.

572
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:28,540
See, that's the whole thing.

573
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:31,620
Yes, I mean, it's great to be recognized in your community,

574
00:38:31,620 --> 00:38:34,360
but you can't put it on a job application, OK?

575
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:37,520
Man, I was number one, you know, at this Southern California tournament.

576
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:38,680
People were cruising my toes.

577
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:39,720
They'd be like, so?

578
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:42,540
Maybe if you're auditioning for Broadway, like Chicago.

579
00:38:42,540 --> 00:38:43,080
There you go.

580
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:43,960
That is a good point.

581
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:45,280
That is a very good point.

582
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:48,040
However, you know, I'm once again, I'm going to go up there,

583
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:51,240
I'm gonna do my thing. You know, if I make it to tomorrow, that's excellent.

584
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:53,440
If I don't, I still came down here to kick with my friends.

585
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:54,840
You know, I represent North County Police.

586
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:56,540
Awesome attitude to have.

587
00:38:56,540 --> 00:38:59,440
Everybody should be like Bob Lombardi, ladies and gentlemen.

588
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:01,340
Everybody!

589
00:39:01,340 --> 00:39:03,640
La dee da dee da!

590
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:06,840
Yay!

591
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:10,540
Any other thoughts that you have for the folks at homelessness?

592
00:39:10,540 --> 00:39:15,840
If you see a police officer drive by after he passes you, flip his ass off.

593
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:17,840
Fuck the police!

594
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:18,840
Oh, can we get a little rap?

595
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:22,840
All right.

596
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:24,840
So, Mel's back over here too.

597
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:26,840
What did you think about PA, Mel?

598
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:28,840
It was, well...

599
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:29,840
Intense!

600
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:31,840
That's Wendell's catchphrase.

601
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:33,840
Hey, sure beats sticking around, but I digress.

602
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:35,840
PA, man, it's...

603
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:38,840
I mean, I can honestly say that I was surprised.

604
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:40,840
I mean, I pretty much...

605
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:44,840
It was Tigger, and it was pretty much his turn he to lose.

606
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:46,840
But, you know, it's like, I mean, people did show up

607
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:50,900
show up and like the thing between JSB though, it was like endless love. I mean, it was like,

608
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:56,500
if frickin', if Stevie Wonder and like someone else blind had to play tennis, it was like

609
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:59,620
endless love, man. It was like back and forth, back and forth. Nothing was happening, then

610
00:39:59,620 --> 00:40:03,820
this guy slammed the door like a closer, and uh, props to him, man. I mean, it's kind of

611
00:40:03,820 --> 00:40:04,820
funny that...

612
00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:10,500
Mel, by the way, did a whole bag of crack for this interview. No, I'm just kidding.

613
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:14,740
I'm trying to think of where this reference leads to. I just, I wasn't, I was following

614
00:40:14,740 --> 00:40:17,420
it that day there must have been something in the smog because I was

615
00:40:17,420 --> 00:40:20,420
totally following him that day and right now I'm listening to this going I have

616
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:24,740
no idea what you're talking about now well that's okay he forgives me I hope

617
00:40:24,740 --> 00:40:28,560
he went to turn and he don't play a damn game of 2dx but I'm sure someone on

618
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:31,980
eBay or someone else is gonna make his pockets a little fatter so props to him

619
00:40:31,980 --> 00:40:35,420
props to him so now you can tell us any like surprises we can look forward to

620
00:40:35,420 --> 00:40:38,260
your routine like dig in your mouth

621
00:40:38,260 --> 00:40:45,260
Oh, damn. Um, well, I don't know about surprises. I mean, it's just, there'll be new moves, that's for sure.

622
00:40:45,260 --> 00:40:51,760
New moves I don't know for- I mean, people think they saw my Let's Talk It Over from Miggle 2, but this one's gonna be a complete 180 remix.

623
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:57,760
It's gonna look pretty tight. I'm just thinking, yeah, it's gonna be enough to be a pretty high qualifier.

624
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:00,760
And then tomorrow, I'd say it's overdrive.

625
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:01,760
Alright, we're gonna end it right there.

626
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:03,260
Did anyone whip out their cock?

627
00:41:03,260 --> 00:41:03,760
What?

628
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:04,760
Did anyone whip out their cock?

629
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:30,960
They have in the back karaoke boos where you can go and sit in and sing karaoke songs for

630
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:34,520
like 50 cents and it grades you on a scale of 0 to 100.

631
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:38,560
Irene and I probably sat in there like all day Saturday and played that game.

632
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:42,800
So we missed like half of the first round of freestyle.

633
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:48,720
The only routines I remember seeing is we saw Bruce Leroy's first routine and we saw

634
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:49,720
Mel B's first routine.

635
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:51,760
We saw a whole little handful around there.

636
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:54,080
Didn't really see much else because we were just too busy playing other stuff.

637
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:56,700
I got to tell you, that seventh style at CyberZone...

638
00:41:56,700 --> 00:41:57,700
Beautiful.

639
00:41:57,700 --> 00:42:01,360
I saw the picture, by the way, of the karaoke machine and the text on that one.

640
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:03,560
They brought one of those out.

641
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:05,360
They had the portable one.

642
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:11,860
They brought one of those out at our meeting for Thanksgiving, our Thanksgiving dinner,

643
00:42:11,860 --> 00:42:15,360
and it grades you like a percentage based on how accurate you are with the music.

644
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:16,840
I want one of those.

645
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:19,600
Buy me.

646
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:21,720
Look on eBay.

647
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:25,960
It's funny, they're talking about eBay in the chat room right now.

648
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:30,960
I guess there's some Max2 machine up for sale on eBay, and an 8th Mix machine.

649
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:31,960
I don't know, 7th upgrade.

650
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:33,960
I don't know what the deal is.

651
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:36,960
I'm going to get them any less than $5,000.

652
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:38,960
Didn't you just buy something big on eBay recently?

653
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:40,960
Yeah, I bought two.

654
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:43,960
Well, they're uh...

655
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:45,960
Cypher Games.

656
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:47,960
They're metal pads.

657
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:49,960
Normally we'd go for $200 a piece.

658
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:51,960
I bought two for $187.

659
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:53,960
Brand new.

660
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:56,960
I guess they were expecting it to go higher.

661
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:58,960
Also, personal message.

662
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:00,960
I'm sure he's not listing, but...

663
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:07,400
The person that goes by the name Aloha to you too, I beat your ass by $2 in 30 seconds.

664
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:08,400
So there.

665
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:13,560
A little fucker wanted to come and upbid me and thought, oh, I'm going to get the pads

666
00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:14,560
at the last minute.

667
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:19,720
Well, I came in 30 seconds to close and threw up the bid at about another $2.

668
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:21,920
You don't want to know about my eBay exploits.

669
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:22,920
What'd you do?

670
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:23,920
Just on every bid I do.

671
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:27,160
If something that I didn't know was going to go for about $15, $20, 10 seconds before

672
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:34,860
I ended up getting this Dojinshi for $30.

673
00:43:34,860 --> 00:43:35,860
It was worth it.

674
00:43:35,860 --> 00:43:37,440
It was a nice 70 page.

675
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:38,440
Really nice.

676
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:42,960
I bid $150 on it because I knew nobody would top it.

677
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:47,920
The thing is, when people do stuff like that to me, I know how much it's worth.

678
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:53,360
I'll bid up to about how much it's worth, so I'll knock up the bid another $100 on something

679
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:55,360
I mean, that's not worth that much.

680
00:43:57,360 --> 00:43:58,360
Right on.

681
00:43:58,360 --> 00:44:02,360
Okay, well, what do you say? You guys want to take a break and we'll come back and do the FUs of the Week?

682
00:44:02,360 --> 00:44:03,360
We'll play more in others.

683
00:44:03,360 --> 00:44:07,360
You want to play more in others? Okay, we'll do more in others, and then we'll come back and do the FUs of the Week,

684
00:44:07,360 --> 00:44:11,360
because we heard Bob Lombardi give an FU of the Week to the police there in that segment.

685
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:12,360
Fuck the police!

686
00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:13,360
Fuck the police!

687
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:17,360
So, you know what, though? Well, we'll get into that during the FUs of the Week,

688
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:22,360
because I have plenty of FUs that deal with the LA trip and things of that sort.

689
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:25,360
Yes, do you feel not so fresh?

690
00:44:25,360 --> 00:44:32,360
Apparently, I constantly always have that not-so-fresh feeling, and I never knew why.

691
00:44:32,360 --> 00:44:33,360
Now you do.

692
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:34,360
Now I do.

693
00:44:34,360 --> 00:44:35,360
Now you know, and knowing is half a battle.

694
00:44:35,360 --> 00:44:37,360
Thanks to my guardian angel.

695
00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:41,360
I still think that's so funny.

696
00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:42,360
It is funny.

697
00:44:42,360 --> 00:44:47,360
Alright, we'll be back.

698
00:49:47,360 --> 00:50:13,360
Orange Lounge Radio, we put your thing down, flip it and reverse it.

699
00:50:13,360 --> 00:50:22,640
I guess you heard that in Target the other day or something, Jamee?

700
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:24,760
Yes, and I hate that type of music.

701
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:27,320
I don't consider that music.

702
00:50:27,320 --> 00:50:28,320
You know what's funny?

703
00:50:28,320 --> 00:50:29,320
They were playing that at the club last night.

704
00:50:29,320 --> 00:50:33,920
I went out to the club to get my dance on, and they played this whole set of booty, new

705
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:34,920
wave booty.

706
00:50:34,920 --> 00:50:38,800
Not the old stuff like you like, but the new wave booty music, like Lil' Kim, that song,

707
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:43,200
And then that song that goes, my lips, my back, my pussy, and my track.

708
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:47,400
Dude, no, when Johnny was over, he found that song and played it for us.

709
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:49,640
And we were like going, turn that off.

710
00:50:49,640 --> 00:50:52,400
Melody made him turn it off.

711
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:54,280
Did it make her ears bleed?

712
00:50:54,280 --> 00:50:56,240
It made me want to vomit.

713
00:50:56,240 --> 00:50:58,320
That song's funny.

714
00:50:58,320 --> 00:51:01,760
But it's just funny to watch all the clientele of the particular bar

715
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:04,360
I would go to going, you know, they're like mouthing along to it.

716
00:51:04,360 --> 00:51:06,120
They'd go, my pussy, I'm not crazy.

717
00:51:06,120 --> 00:51:09,080
Everybody's mouth is funny.

718
00:51:09,080 --> 00:51:10,480
Anyway, yeah, hi.

719
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:11,960
You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

720
00:51:11,960 --> 00:51:14,680
We occasionally talk about Bamani on this show when

721
00:51:14,680 --> 00:51:16,640
there's nothing better to talk about.

722
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:17,400
Oh, yes, zero.

723
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:20,600
I heard two little 12-year-old girls singing that song on the

724
00:51:20,600 --> 00:51:22,000
bus today.

725
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:23,120
I'm not even joking.

726
00:51:23,120 --> 00:51:24,960
They're standing there on the bus doing it.

727
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:27,680
I'm like, they know this by heart.

728
00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:29,480
They must have listened to it like 100 times just before

729
00:51:29,480 --> 00:51:30,200
they got on the bus.

730
00:51:30,200 --> 00:51:32,400
It was sad and scary all at the same time.

731
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:33,960
You know what it was when I was a kid?

732
00:51:33,960 --> 00:51:35,960
Remember, you too can prevent skanks.

733
00:52:03,960 --> 00:52:18,960
Do you realize that people are still having sex, they've been told nuts, perhaps they are

734
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:19,960
perplexed?

735
00:52:19,960 --> 00:52:23,960
When you see them holding hands, they're making future plans to engage in re-

736
00:52:23,960 --> 00:52:32,480
Speaking of bad remixes, I downloaded Slim Shady, and the background music was Billie

737
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:38,480
I got a really bad one. No, this is fucking horrible. Listen to this. I just downloaded

738
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:41,480
this the other day. This is the most fucking horrible thing I've ever heard in my life.

739
00:52:41,480 --> 00:52:42,480
No, I'll bring it next week.

740
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:45,440
Okay. We're going to have to have like a, some kind of, maybe like a pre-show or sometime

741
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:46,600
on the station we have to play.

742
00:52:46,600 --> 00:52:47,600
Worst remix ever.

743
00:52:47,600 --> 00:52:49,320
Really, really bad remixes.

744
00:52:49,320 --> 00:52:55,120
Nothing beats the Splat Attack, William Shatner techno mixes. Those are the most god-awful

745
00:52:55,120 --> 00:53:00,480
things you'll ever hear. The music's bad, and the samples are worse. It's just awful.

746
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:04,060
listeners you might recognize a song from studio six dollars and how they rate

747
00:53:04,060 --> 00:53:11,060
this song

748
00:53:11,060 --> 00:53:17,060
And I'm the next one to fight It's the wrong party

749
00:53:17,060 --> 00:53:19,060
Who's the next one to fight?

750
00:53:19,060 --> 00:53:21,060
I'm gonna win this game!

751
00:53:21,060 --> 00:53:22,060
Come on!

752
00:53:22,060 --> 00:53:23,060
Woo!

753
00:53:23,060 --> 00:53:24,060
I'm gonna win this game!

754
00:53:24,060 --> 00:53:25,060
Come on!

755
00:53:25,060 --> 00:53:26,060
Come on!

756
00:53:26,060 --> 00:53:28,060
There are two different fucking keys!

757
00:53:28,060 --> 00:53:29,060
Okay?

758
00:53:29,060 --> 00:53:35,060
That was torture because, okay, I have a perfect sense of pitch.

759
00:53:35,060 --> 00:53:36,060
I'm a fan.

760
00:53:36,060 --> 00:53:39,060
I used to elbow people when their horns were out of tune.

761
00:53:39,060 --> 00:53:41,060
They'd go, okay, you're out of tune.

762
00:53:41,060 --> 00:53:47,060
And that, the dissonance in that was enough to make heads explode like in scanners.

763
00:53:47,060 --> 00:53:48,060
Okay?

764
00:53:48,060 --> 00:53:52,060
The very first thing the chat room goes, is that a twen mix?

765
00:53:52,060 --> 00:53:55,060
Chat room, I love you.

766
00:53:55,060 --> 00:54:01,060
Okay, I mean like who decided to mix Vincent D'amore and Whitney Houston, that's what I want to know.

767
00:54:01,060 --> 00:54:11,060
The worst thing I heard lately was that max 300 jump, I don't know who did it, but it's like it's a seven jump with max 300 and like they just laid them on top of each other.

768
00:54:11,060 --> 00:54:15,060
The worst one is this Mario, what was it, Mario Max?

769
00:54:15,060 --> 00:54:16,060
Oh yeah.

770
00:54:16,060 --> 00:54:21,060
And, and, and, and I could keep you know people were like, people, I swear to god there were people doing talkbacks and like these,

771
00:54:21,060 --> 00:54:28,060
so why can't there, anyone make any good remixes of Max 300 like Mario Max and, and this stuff and I'm like, Mar, what?

772
00:54:28,060 --> 00:54:36,060
It's awful. Awful shit. Don't mix anything from fourth mix with Max 300, it's just wrong.

773
00:54:36,060 --> 00:54:43,060
No, it was just horrible anyway. It was like, they'd cut, they'd stop Max, play some Mario, cut Mario, play some Max.

774
00:54:43,060 --> 00:54:45,060
Ew, is this for the tix?

775
00:54:49,060 --> 00:54:57,060
Ew. No, first of all, Whitney Houston needs to have her larynx pulled out so that we never have to hear from her again.

776
00:54:57,060 --> 00:55:05,060
Yeah, tell her to stop acting. I hated that fucking movie. My girlfriend made me watch it last night. Freaking bodyguard. The whole movie was about her bitching.

777
00:55:35,060 --> 00:55:37,600
Dolly Parton. Dolly Parton cried during that.

778
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:40,840
Dolly Parton cries in the middle of it. I agree.

779
00:55:40,840 --> 00:55:45,100
There is no other version of that song. Bobby Brown needs to kill him.

780
00:55:45,100 --> 00:55:49,320
Only two versions of that song exist to me. Then again though, Dolly Parton did her share

781
00:55:49,320 --> 00:55:53,840
of butchering when it came to stairway. We don't talk about that. It doesn't exist.

782
00:55:53,840 --> 00:55:55,840
Okay. She still forgives Dolly Parton.

783
00:55:55,840 --> 00:55:58,480
There's two good versions of I Will Always Love You.

784
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:02,040
Okay Whitney, Dolly Parton has her own theme park. How about you?

785
00:56:02,040 --> 00:56:04,400
It's not Skank Park, is there?

786
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:05,400
There's...

787
00:56:05,400 --> 00:56:07,400
It's South Sacramento.

788
00:56:07,400 --> 00:56:10,520
It's South Sacramento.

789
00:56:10,520 --> 00:56:12,880
Two good versions of I Will Always Love You.

790
00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:17,240
Dolly Parton version, and the version the girl belts out the window in Hedvig.

791
00:56:17,240 --> 00:56:18,240
That's it.

792
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:19,240
Yes.

793
00:56:19,240 --> 00:56:20,240
That is the best.

794
00:56:20,240 --> 00:56:22,880
You're the one done with the thick country accent.

795
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:26,160
That was one of the highlights of my L.A. trip, I was getting to see Hedvig on stage.

796
00:56:26,160 --> 00:56:27,560
We're taking you next time.

797
00:56:27,560 --> 00:56:28,560
Irene and I want to go back.

798
00:56:28,560 --> 00:56:29,560
Why isn't Irene here tonight?

799
00:56:29,560 --> 00:56:30,560
She promised me she'd be here.

800
00:56:30,560 --> 00:56:33,080
I mean, if you're listening, you suck.

801
00:56:33,080 --> 00:56:35,080
Gum hella sucks.

802
00:56:35,080 --> 00:56:37,280
Hey, we have shrimp chips and you're missing out.

803
00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:44,280
Yeah, I have that CD that Brad wanted with all the Death Race songs on it.

804
00:56:44,680 --> 00:56:45,840
Death Race?

805
00:56:45,840 --> 00:56:49,280
Oh, Death Race, anyway.

806
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:53,080
Okay, now that we've talked about horrible remixes, you want to get to the FUs of the week?

807
00:56:53,080 --> 00:56:54,940
Yeah.

808
00:56:54,940 --> 00:56:58,520
Since we might have some new people listening in tonight, because we have the

809
00:56:58,520 --> 00:57:00,120
Cyberbeat stuff, some

810
00:57:00,120 --> 00:57:03,160
people want to tune in to hear that tell the folks what the FUs of the week are all

811
00:57:03,160 --> 00:57:03,480
about

812
00:57:03,480 --> 00:57:07,680
we pick stuff that we hate and bitch about it

813
00:57:07,680 --> 00:57:14,040
that's about it

814
00:57:14,040 --> 00:57:22,040
this is fucked up

815
00:57:22,040 --> 00:57:25,400
well okay last night it was me and Tina

816
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:28,920
and her sister in law we're all coming back from

817
00:57:28,920 --> 00:57:31,840
The Rocky cast meeting and we were gonna

818
00:57:34,520 --> 00:57:38,080
Now that was a surprise to me reading that you went back there

819
00:57:39,680 --> 00:57:43,760
Let it be I went to the good letter B. Good. Oh, yeah, okay, okay, who by the way?

820
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:47,020
Fuck them for not sending me my free ice cream coupon yet. I'm gonna call and like

821
00:57:47,680 --> 00:57:49,680
tell their district manager and

822
00:57:50,320 --> 00:57:52,320
Bitch them out

823
00:57:52,320 --> 00:57:56,320
I know it looks sour, but anyways, we'll go.

824
00:57:56,320 --> 00:57:58,320
Yes! We got a good burp.

825
00:57:58,320 --> 00:58:02,320
That burp is dedicated to the leather visa envelope.

826
00:58:02,320 --> 00:58:06,320
And also this, you know, one was brought to you not by Propel,

827
00:58:06,320 --> 00:58:10,320
it was brought to you by Martinelli's Cranberry Apples Working Cider.

828
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:12,320
Anyway, yeah.

829
00:58:12,320 --> 00:58:19,320
Anyway, um, this guy in the truck, I believe he's a guy who bought in on our great search for jahi.

830
00:58:19,320 --> 00:58:25,320
Um, we were, this truck was like, speeding up telling me, so you know what I did?

831
00:58:25,320 --> 00:58:27,320
You know what I did?

832
00:58:27,320 --> 00:58:28,320
You cut him off.

833
00:58:28,320 --> 00:58:31,320
I flew down to five miles an hour.

834
00:58:31,320 --> 00:58:34,320
And he couldn't pass me because there were cars coming.

835
00:58:34,320 --> 00:58:37,320
So I was a little bit cold.

836
00:58:37,320 --> 00:58:42,320
And then I saw him about to duck over to turn, so I cut right in front of him and turned.

837
00:58:42,320 --> 00:58:44,320
Right on to Madison.

838
00:58:44,320 --> 00:58:46,320
And I went another five miles an hour.

839
00:58:46,320 --> 00:58:48,320
He went to pass me, I cut him off.

840
00:58:48,320 --> 00:58:50,320
He went past me, I cut him off!

841
00:58:50,320 --> 00:58:56,320
And then, I drove off into the sunset or a road actually at 3 in the morning or something like that.

842
00:58:56,320 --> 00:58:59,320
Into the darkness, into the dark black forest.

843
00:58:59,320 --> 00:59:01,320
That's more appropriate for you, you drove off into the darkness.

844
00:59:01,320 --> 00:59:02,320
So...

845
00:59:02,320 --> 00:59:04,320
From whence you came.

846
00:59:04,320 --> 00:59:07,320
I was hoping that he would have drove past me so I could wave at him.

847
00:59:07,320 --> 00:59:10,320
I love to smell people when there's no traffic.

848
00:59:10,320 --> 00:59:12,320
Actually, it was more like more than one in the morning.

849
00:59:12,320 --> 00:59:14,320
Ah, so you're the bitch.

850
00:59:14,320 --> 00:59:18,320
Yeah, but fuck, no, he brought it on himself because he tailgated me, so fuck him.

851
00:59:18,320 --> 00:59:20,320
Yeah.

852
00:59:20,320 --> 00:59:24,320
I'd also like to say, um...

853
00:59:24,320 --> 00:59:27,320
You know what? I'm not really that angsty about anything else.

854
00:59:27,320 --> 00:59:34,320
There was this, like, scary person, though, that was at the grocery store.

855
00:59:34,320 --> 00:59:38,320
She was nice, but she was scary and wanted to talk to me.

856
00:59:38,320 --> 00:59:40,320
It was definite Dawn Syndrome.

857
00:59:40,320 --> 00:59:44,320
But I don't think anyone would get that much of a lesson that I need at rock n' roll.

858
00:59:45,320 --> 00:59:47,320
You know what I'm talking about.

859
00:59:48,320 --> 00:59:51,320
Disorderly and worthless nonsense.

860
00:59:51,320 --> 00:59:55,320
It's basically when people come up to you and start idle conversations about nothing.

861
00:59:55,320 --> 01:00:03,320
Like say for instance, you're standing in line with groceries or something and they're like, buying groceries, huh?

862
01:00:03,320 --> 01:00:05,320
You know, just stupid shit like that.

863
01:00:05,320 --> 01:00:11,320
I used to work there, like, I would do my internship in the morning when they were on air.

864
01:00:11,320 --> 01:00:16,320
And they would start doing that around the station, not even on their show.

865
01:00:16,320 --> 01:00:20,320
They would just start walking around doing it for no reason. It was actually pretty funny.

866
01:00:20,320 --> 01:00:26,320
But, yeah, that just gave me an idea for another F.U. I will hold on to it.

867
01:00:26,320 --> 01:00:34,320
Well, um, I need to retract my F.U. to my C.E. player, because now that I rigged it ghetto-style with paper,

868
01:00:34,320 --> 01:00:40,320
You know, my faceplate stays on, although I can't turn down the volume or go back to listen to a track again.

869
01:00:40,320 --> 01:00:41,320
Hooray, ghetto!

870
01:00:41,320 --> 01:00:42,320
Yay!

871
01:00:42,320 --> 01:00:51,320
Um, also, um, another F.U. of the week goes toward, um, the snack machine at my work.

872
01:00:51,320 --> 01:00:56,320
Because in the morning, if I forget to eat my breakfast, the only thing that I have to eat is the nutrient bar out of the snack machine.

873
01:00:56,320 --> 01:00:58,320
Our snack machine doesn't take dollars.

874
01:00:58,320 --> 01:01:03,320
Or if it takes the dollar, it tells you to use current change.

875
01:01:03,320 --> 01:01:07,320
It also doesn't take nickels, dimes, or quarters.

876
01:01:07,320 --> 01:01:08,320
So basically all that-

877
01:01:08,320 --> 01:01:09,320
And then he goes,

878
01:01:09,320 --> 01:01:10,320
Ah, I can't get it.

879
01:01:10,320 --> 01:01:12,320
Ugh.

880
01:01:12,320 --> 01:01:14,320
It doesn't take a decent piece of paper.

881
01:01:14,320 --> 01:01:17,320
Oh god.

882
01:01:17,320 --> 01:01:18,320
Yeah, I'm still-

883
01:01:18,320 --> 01:01:19,320
Fuck that.

884
01:01:19,320 --> 01:01:22,320
I'm on a new work schedule too, so fuck going to bed early.

885
01:01:22,320 --> 01:01:25,320
But I like getting out of work earlier, so yeah, that's it.

886
01:01:25,320 --> 01:01:27,320
Oh yeah, and fuck my back.

887
01:01:27,320 --> 01:01:28,320
Because my, um, shoulder-

888
01:01:28,320 --> 01:01:31,320
I put the muscle under my shoulder blade, and it hurt a lot.

889
01:01:31,320 --> 01:01:33,320
That's it.

890
01:01:33,320 --> 01:01:35,320
Perp.

891
01:01:35,320 --> 01:01:37,320
Dot com.

892
01:01:37,320 --> 01:01:39,320
Fartville.

893
01:01:41,320 --> 01:01:44,320
Um, not too angsty this week.

894
01:01:44,320 --> 01:01:46,320
No!

895
01:01:46,320 --> 01:01:48,320
I don't know, I've been just tired, so...

896
01:01:48,320 --> 01:01:50,320
No!

897
01:01:50,320 --> 01:01:54,320
Tired not getting out because I'm trying to save money, so I'm not angsty.

898
01:01:54,320 --> 01:01:57,320
Um, let's see here.

899
01:01:57,320 --> 01:02:00,320
Oh, F you to the stupid bitch at, uh, Raley's.

900
01:02:00,320 --> 01:02:06,480
any stupid whore um i don't want your fucking sample i've said to you before and i said to you again

901
01:02:06,480 --> 01:02:11,680
stop trying to give me the damn sample can she be a whore really who would pay for her i don't know

902
01:02:11,680 --> 01:02:16,640
she's ugly but anyways yeah she tried to give me the sample to my friend and it was like some

903
01:02:16,640 --> 01:02:22,480
taking rib on a stick and she dropped the fucking thing down down it slid down a little you know

904
01:02:22,480 --> 01:02:28,160
little cover there's like and then like fell into like a basket full of chips or something like that

905
01:02:28,160 --> 01:02:30,160
And said, oh, let me give you another one!

906
01:02:58,160 --> 01:03:09,160
So what do the people try to do? They try to cut between me and the 6-inch gap between the rail, when there's a nice 3 feet or more, probably like 6 feet on the other side of me.

907
01:03:09,160 --> 01:03:23,160
I mean, you... I think... I'm pretty convinced that everybody that works at VPD has no sense of, um... well, let's see, no common sense. They have no common sense whatsoever. They're like, oh, I was... what?

908
01:03:23,160 --> 01:03:31,160
F.U. to them. F.U. to stupid drivers because you're still out there. I hate you.

909
01:03:31,160 --> 01:03:39,160
And F.U. to everybody who watches Oprah because Oprah sucks.

910
01:03:39,160 --> 01:03:43,160
Don't talk about my mother like that.

911
01:03:43,160 --> 01:04:07,160
the other day, after the Michael Jackson interview thing, they were like doing a talk back on, like acting like they're experts on the whole, you know, subject and everything, and they absolutely had, I don't even think any of them watched the special, and they were just talking back for a good two hours about the damn thing. I just saw this and went, oh look, Jackass is still not talking about the current challenge of like, Vader's Jim or something like that. Stupid fucking people.

912
01:04:07,160 --> 01:04:16,160
umm, after you do the people in the Congo, I'm gonna fucking cast an Ebola spell on your whole country, so there.

913
01:04:16,160 --> 01:04:17,160
What are you gonna do now?

914
01:04:17,160 --> 01:04:18,160
I'm in another country.

915
01:04:18,160 --> 01:04:19,160
Haha, you can't touch me.

916
01:04:19,160 --> 01:04:20,160
Ehh.

917
01:04:20,160 --> 01:04:21,160
And you're gonna die.

918
01:04:21,160 --> 01:04:22,160
From Ebola.

919
01:04:22,160 --> 01:04:23,160
They'll cast rocket over the spell.

920
01:04:23,160 --> 01:04:28,160
Wuh-wuh-wuh-wuh-wuh-wuh-wuh-wuh-wuh!

921
01:04:28,160 --> 01:04:30,160
See, those- I weep for humanity.

922
01:04:30,160 --> 01:04:33,160
And these people that I weep, you know, probably weep.

923
01:04:33,160 --> 01:04:38,160
That and the whole fact that they're shutting down the Folsom Dam because of the threat of terrorism.

924
01:04:38,160 --> 01:04:45,160
Because, you know, people are going to come out of the middle of nowhere and just bomb the dam instead of, you know, bombing L.A., San Francisco, you know, one of the major cities.

925
01:04:45,160 --> 01:04:49,160
If the Folsom Dam could bomb, wouldn't it just flood the prison?

926
01:04:49,160 --> 01:04:52,160
It would flood Sacramento with 12 feet of water.

927
01:04:53,160 --> 01:04:55,160
Which I wouldn't miss it.

928
01:04:56,160 --> 01:04:58,160
That's where people might stop.

929
01:04:59,160 --> 01:05:01,160
I wouldn't miss Sacramento.

930
01:05:01,160 --> 01:05:03,160
I'd be up on the cliff going,

931
01:05:03,160 --> 01:05:05,160
Ah, the water's going down!

932
01:05:05,160 --> 01:05:06,160
Oh, you're drowning!

933
01:05:06,160 --> 01:05:09,160
As long as they give me advanced warning so I can get all my video game systems out of my house.

934
01:05:09,160 --> 01:05:12,160
Do you realize how much Loki is like Nelson from The Simpsons?

935
01:05:12,160 --> 01:05:14,160
Uh-huh!

936
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:16,160
Oh, and the best one!

937
01:05:16,160 --> 01:05:18,160
I just laughed my ass off when I saw this.

938
01:05:18,160 --> 01:05:21,160
That'd be the stupid doctors that botched that fucking...

939
01:05:21,160 --> 01:05:25,160
That was hilarious.

940
01:05:25,160 --> 01:05:28,160
The thing was labeled correctly.

941
01:05:28,160 --> 01:05:29,160
A...

942
01:05:29,160 --> 01:05:30,160
Was it A, the...

943
01:05:30,160 --> 01:05:34,160
I don't know. The organs were A and the girl was O.

944
01:05:34,160 --> 01:05:37,160
There doesn't go anywhere in the same tube of credit.

945
01:05:37,160 --> 01:05:40,160
She'll throw her own block through the square hole.

946
01:05:40,160 --> 01:05:43,160
Were they Kaiser? They weren't Kaiser, were they?

947
01:05:43,160 --> 01:05:47,160
They're so stupid. They're like trying to save her. I'm like, dude, she's so dead.

948
01:05:50,160 --> 01:05:54,160
And they're like so surprised. Oh my god, she died! I can't believe it!

949
01:05:54,160 --> 01:05:57,160
So, check out how this happened!

950
01:05:57,160 --> 01:05:59,160
And there's her parents, though, who think,

951
01:05:59,160 --> 01:06:02,160
oh, well, we want a second opinion to say she's a little brain dead.

952
01:06:02,160 --> 01:06:04,160
Uh, let's see here.

953
01:06:04,160 --> 01:06:10,160
I mean, I feel bad for them that their daughter was lost due to incompetence.

954
01:06:10,160 --> 01:06:12,160
I don't know if they'll talk or anything, but she's not moving.

955
01:06:12,160 --> 01:06:17,160
But no brain, I don't see how you can simulate a lack of brain activity.

956
01:06:17,160 --> 01:06:19,160
Oh, well, she's brain dead.

957
01:06:19,160 --> 01:06:24,160
I don't know how you can get a sex unit to test that shows you're a brain activity.

958
01:06:24,160 --> 01:06:29,160
I mean, unless it's blind hope, blind faith, you know, wanting to grasp at anything.

959
01:06:30,160 --> 01:06:37,160
But the first step toward healing and grieving is realizing that you actually have something to grieve.

960
01:06:37,160 --> 01:06:39,160
We poached her with a stick, man. See you, Moo!

961
01:06:41,160 --> 01:06:42,160
Oh yeah, another thing.

962
01:06:42,160 --> 01:06:47,160
Effing the stupid people in Rhode Island that got caught in that stupid fire. I know you're all dead.

963
01:06:47,160 --> 01:06:49,160
Isn't that a great white concert?

964
01:06:49,160 --> 01:06:55,560
Hold on, hold on, hold on. I'm not going to cover probably what you're talking about.

965
01:06:55,560 --> 01:06:58,480
But it's hilarious because they're like, oh my god it's so tragic!

966
01:06:58,480 --> 01:07:01,680
Hello, they just used the one exit instead of the three fire exits that were built in

967
01:07:01,680 --> 01:07:02,280
this place.

968
01:07:02,280 --> 01:07:06,640
Oh! They're trying to get out the one door! Everyone's like, but there's exits over here

969
01:07:06,640 --> 01:07:10,480
marked fire exits in case of fire, like, that's happening right now!

970
01:07:10,480 --> 01:07:11,080
Oops.

971
01:07:11,080 --> 01:07:15,080
Yeah, I cried through humanity.

972
01:07:15,080 --> 01:07:25,080
It was a great white concert. Were they in sort of these fireworks that were illegal?

973
01:07:25,080 --> 01:07:28,080
I think it was half the audience.

974
01:07:28,080 --> 01:07:40,080
I have something to say about this. As long as we're joking about tragic events in the news, I have some things I'd like to say.

975
01:07:40,080 --> 01:07:46,900
okay f you to the band great white for setting that club on fire and killing a

976
01:07:46,900 --> 01:07:51,560
bunch of people because I had to wait 45 minutes to get into the club last night

977
01:07:51,560 --> 01:07:56,720
because they actually had to enforce the fire code because you dolts burn down a

978
01:07:56,720 --> 01:07:59,460
club on the other side of the country and I don't know if you've seen the

979
01:07:59,460 --> 01:08:02,760
video of this but like when the thing set on fire all these people are looking

980
01:08:02,760 --> 01:08:06,920
at the roof going dude I think there's something on fire if I thought the club

981
01:08:06,920 --> 01:08:10,840

01:08:13,960 --> 01:08:17,960

984
01:08:20,120 --> 01:08:23,240
and you know what the saddest thing about this whole thing is

985
01:08:23,240 --> 01:08:28,520
album sales are going to go through the roof for these guys pun intended

986
01:08:28,520 --> 01:08:32,600
great white is going to actually have a career again

987
01:08:32,600 --> 01:08:36,440
that's that's the real tragedy here ladies and gentlemen great white we'll

988
01:08:36,440 --> 01:08:43,440
bring the house down

989
01:08:48,680 --> 01:08:52,880
moving on my other refuse the week are out but slides on i five

990
01:08:52,880 --> 01:08:55,800
because because of mudslides on i five

991
01:08:55,800 --> 01:08:58,400
and i'm not talking about the drink i'm talking about the actual like but

992
01:08:58,400 --> 01:09:01,500
sliding down the hill and covering the freeway because of that

993
01:09:01,500 --> 01:09:03,800
we heard the traffic was blocked for hours

994
01:09:03,800 --> 01:09:09,500
So we had to go down 101 to get to LA. That took like seven and a half hours.

995
01:09:09,500 --> 01:09:10,880
I hated it.

996
01:09:10,880 --> 01:09:16,680
Well, no, I didn't hate it because, you know, we were with good company, so it was all good.

997
01:09:16,680 --> 01:09:19,200
Part of the countryside

998
01:09:19,200 --> 01:09:22,240
alongside the grapevine was on fire.

999
01:09:22,240 --> 01:09:25,780
Cool. We were stuck in traffic for three hours on the grapevine.

1000
01:09:25,780 --> 01:09:30,000
And then we went by and saw helicopters and fire and I took pictures of it.

1001
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,000
Great White playing there, too?

1002
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:34,000
Oh, yes, no.

1003
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:39,000
Alright, uh...

1004
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:41,000
Also, what else is my F-use of the week?

1005
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:43,000
Oh.

1006
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:46,000
F... F-stupid children.

1007
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:47,000
Yes!

1008
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:49,000
You twit. Alright.

1009
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:51,000
Remember, JB and I eat children. Children ramen.

1010
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:53,000
Good, I have a... somebody you can go eat.

1011
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:54,000
Okay.

1012
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:57,000
No, we've been... we've come up with different flavors.

1013
01:09:57,000 --> 01:10:03,000
There's RVGL flavor that tastes like skank, and then you know, scandia flavor, which is pretty crunchy in case.

1014
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,000
The CCL flavor tastes like ass.

1015
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:10,000
It should taste like sweat because this is what the place smells like.

1016
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:14,000
It should taste like drugs and alcohol because this is what CCL is filled with.

1017
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:18,000
Alright, speaking of zero, let's hear it. Your FUs of the Week, please.

1018
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:28,000
Okay, I got a few. One is to the jackass over at Skandia who thought it would be a good idea to try to punk everybody out of their tokens on the machine.

1019
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:48,000
He was like, I went up to go play a game, and there was a guy sitting up there, and he came up and tried to steal my Toki, and then he tried to yell at me and start a fight with me on the extreme machine.

1020
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:59,000
And then, he went off and he like, got mad because he didn't get to play, which he was just about to take people's toes to do and start punching the carousel, thinking like, that's a good way to get rid of the stress.

1021
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:09,000
And also, little kids who think there's a crosswalk across the DDR panels, it, it's pretty simple.

1022
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:17,000
No, this is a raging epidemic in every arcade, I'm sure. Little kids who somehow see a crosswalk right there. I, what is up with that?

1023
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:20,000
when i grabbed the little kid and took him to his parents?

1024
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:25,000
Your child is going to end up with a broken foot if you don't watch your little kid.

1025
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:28,000
Where to play VR?

1026
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:30,000
I'll come back to this. Is this the U.S.A. mission mission?

1027
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:33,000
The fourth mission in the corner.

1028
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:37,000
and this little kid proceeds to walk across the machine or grab the kid and take it from his parents.

1029
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:51,000
When I was in there and they had the little kids running across there, I looked at a friend of mine,

1030
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:55,000
and I don't know who it was, and I said, is there a cross walking across the machine?

1031
01:11:55,000 --> 01:12:01,000
And his kid's mom heard me, and his kid's mom heard me, and so excuse me, when I told him not to be doing that,

1032
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:06,000
I wasn't even talking to you. I was just saying it like in general.

1033
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,000
I was yelling at your child.

1034
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:10,000
There were some kids I wish I could meet.

1035
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:14,000
And also a big F.U. to the drunk lady in Scandinavia on Friday.

1036
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:19,000
She was from Brazil, Texas, New York, and like Europe somewhere.

1037
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:26,000
And she kept telling everybody how sexy they were and she was so bombed out and drugged.

1038
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:27,000
It was pretty cool.

1039
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:40,920
I went over there yesterday and I'm trying to pick out some soda to drink and this lady

1040
01:12:40,920 --> 01:12:45,240
comes up trying to put soda in my cart trying to tell me that this is what you should get

1041
01:12:45,240 --> 01:12:50,120
and this is what you should get and I was like no and she's like I ended up just leaving

1042
01:12:50,120 --> 01:12:54,840
my cart and walking out of the store because she put like four 12 packs if I think after

1043
01:12:54,840 --> 01:13:00,840
I told her no. And I was like, screw you, and I left. Because she was a bitch. And driver's force.

1044
01:13:24,840 --> 01:13:26,600
because there was

1045
01:13:26,600 --> 01:13:29,280
someone who was incredibly rude to her

1046
01:13:29,280 --> 01:13:29,920
but

1047
01:13:29,920 --> 01:13:32,400
they'll give you all these lines and then they try to sell you back

1048
01:13:32,400 --> 01:13:33,860
so finally I looked over at the guy

1049
01:13:33,860 --> 01:13:38,460
he says yeah I'm doing a communication project and by the way you know I just want to talk to all the

1050
01:13:38,460 --> 01:13:40,320
pretty women in the part of the way

1051
01:13:40,320 --> 01:13:42,480
first of all I don't want to buy magazines

1052
01:13:42,480 --> 01:13:44,080
oh you've already talked to somebody

1053
01:13:44,080 --> 01:13:47,680
no but my friend has and quite honestly no money belongs to money in my damn pocket

1054
01:13:47,680 --> 01:13:50,520
not in yours

1055
01:13:50,520 --> 01:13:51,520
and he's just like

1056
01:13:51,520 --> 01:13:55,520
don't you want to buy one i'm like no i'm not nice leave so he left

1057
01:13:57,600 --> 01:14:03,120
another one back to ccl that's right when they thought like they tell everyone that

1058
01:14:03,120 --> 01:14:08,240
their pads were all in good condition why did i feel like i on doubles heavy like in the middle

1059
01:14:08,240 --> 01:14:13,200
of the song because none of the right pad work and the stupid little rabbit girl who like would not

1060
01:14:13,200 --> 01:14:19,200
I like, seriously, if I was a girl who would be a rad boy, she'd be like, I don't know,

1061
01:14:19,200 --> 01:14:23,200
but I'm just very, I just get mad.

1062
01:14:23,200 --> 01:14:27,200
She was stepping on her foot when you were born.

1063
01:14:27,200 --> 01:14:30,200
She knocked away.

1064
01:14:30,200 --> 01:14:34,200
All right, let's move on to the chatroom FUs, shall we?

1065
01:14:34,200 --> 01:14:35,200
Play happy music.

1066
01:14:35,200 --> 01:14:38,200
Brace yourself, there's a ton.

1067
01:14:38,200 --> 01:14:42,720
Muhymer says fuck word problems fuck winter storms that lead to flooding of the massive sort

1068
01:14:42,900 --> 01:14:48,120
Fuck my school for saying that school was canceled Thursday because of snow and then deciding to change their minds a full day the night before

1069
01:14:48,680 --> 01:14:53,660
Fuck my dad for still not getting cable so I can have wireless with my laptop and download muchos DDR stuff

1070
01:14:53,660 --> 01:14:58,800
Sad face fuck my heater for breaking also and fuck the new one for causing my allergies to annihilate me

1071
01:14:59,360 --> 01:15:04,440
Yeah, evil now key to DX says a fuck you to people who don't know how to follow forum rules

1072
01:15:34,440 --> 01:15:40,440
It's really sad, but it's a remix, so it doesn't really count.

1073
01:15:40,440 --> 01:15:42,440
It's not really hard, then.

1074
01:15:42,440 --> 01:15:44,440
Yeah, exactly.

1075
01:15:44,440 --> 01:15:46,440
Hey, hack on, nephew.

1076
01:15:46,440 --> 01:15:55,440
RiceRyc3 says, Fuck you, Gray Davis, for cutting the funds for my school. I need my damn classes to transfer ASAP.

1077
01:15:55,440 --> 01:16:02,440
the

1078
01:16:04,440 --> 01:16:07,280
you know folks that college is completely useless and was a waste of

1079
01:16:07,280 --> 01:16:10,880
money all the people that get out of college end up coming to work at my

1080
01:16:10,880 --> 01:16:11,680
uh... work

1081
01:16:11,680 --> 01:16:13,460
they get entry-level positions

1082
01:16:13,460 --> 01:16:15,480
words i haven't gone to college

1083
01:16:15,480 --> 01:16:18,600
right right going to call for a specific to the fucking boring a waste of my

1084
01:16:18,600 --> 01:16:19,880
money

1085
01:16:19,880 --> 01:16:21,260
and i'm

1086
01:16:21,260 --> 01:16:24,080
maybe not as much as they are but you know what they got to pay back his

1087
01:16:24,080 --> 01:16:29,720
college loans so technically I'm above them the one advantage of having going

1088
01:16:29,720 --> 01:16:32,760
to college at least for three years is the companies when they hire you they

1089
01:16:32,760 --> 01:16:36,920
do have to hire you for a little bit more if you had like two or more years

1090
01:16:36,920 --> 01:16:42,640
of college three yeah now what if I got screwed at my company cuz I've had three

1091
01:16:42,640 --> 01:16:45,220
even though I don't don't have a piece of paper to show it anyway

1092
01:16:45,220 --> 01:16:49,520
deaf square says fuck everybody who doesn't like oatmeal raisin cookies

1093
01:16:49,520 --> 01:16:56,000
because they fucking rule what about just oatmeal cookies then that was daft

1094
01:16:56,000 --> 01:17:02,640

1096
01:17:12,140 --> 01:17:15,840
23rd magus says fuck you to the worm that's still going through these net

1097
01:17:15,840 --> 01:17:19,000
servers it probably brought down live journal the other day actually a denial

1098
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:22,000
The denial of service attack brought down LiveJournal. Fuck people that do that.

1099
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:23,000
Jesus.

1100
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:27,000
You know what denial of service attack is? That's when you get all the computers

1101
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:33,000
that ping a server like Yahoo or CNN or whatever to try and take it down, to overload it and take it down.

1102
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:35,000
That's what happened to LiveJournal the other day.

1103
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:38,000
But you know they credited all the paid users with four extra days because of it.

1104
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:39,000
Really?

1105
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:40,000
Okay, I didn't notice.

1106
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:41,000
Yep, they did.

1107
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:43,000
Nice pay-through June anyway.

1108
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:45,000
Well, now it's pay-through June 4th.

01:17:56,040 --> 01:17:57,960
it's twenty five dollars for a year

1114
01:17:57,960 --> 01:17:59,360

1115
01:17:59,360 --> 01:18:02,280
well i mean but the live journal went down for the paid users too

1116
01:18:02,280 --> 01:18:05,680
i mean that sucks but yeah but it's their fault

1117
01:18:05,680 --> 01:18:09,920

1119
01:18:28,720 --> 01:18:32,680
that is so weird and i thought zero period meant

1120
01:18:32,680 --> 01:18:35,720
it was i thought zero this 23rd magazine zero

1121
01:18:35,720 --> 01:18:40,900
zero period was called zero period because it was before first period

1122
01:18:40,900 --> 01:18:42,160
or you know

1123
01:18:42,160 --> 01:18:45,040
well i guess it depends i guess it depends like our schools didn't have a

01:18:45,040 --> 01:18:48,680
home we didn't have

1125
01:18:48,680 --> 01:18:52,600
anything is it is it is against the law for them to deny you your lunch time so

01:18:52,600 --> 01:18:53,960
you know what you need to do

1127
01:18:53,960 --> 01:18:57,760
you need to find whatever documentation you have on that

1128
01:18:57,760 --> 01:19:01,400
send it not only to the school board but to the PTA

1129

1144
01:19:42,980 --> 01:19:44,980
Yeah, I thought it was one of like seven or eight at the most.

1145
01:19:44,980 --> 01:19:48,980
Wait, wait, wait. You got a heart, Jamie, in the chatroom, please.

1146
01:19:48,980 --> 01:19:50,980
I don't know. Just because.

1147
01:19:50,980 --> 01:19:53,980
Just explain to me why I have a heart.

1148
01:19:53,980 --> 01:19:55,980
Darktits who you put we heart DS.

1149
01:19:55,980 --> 01:20:01,980
Oh, thank you. I don't have a heart, though. I have a lump of coal, like spermet.

1150
01:20:01,980 --> 01:20:03,980
You do, it's just black!

1151
01:20:03,980 --> 01:20:05,980
I have a love of coal, like Smurfette.

1152
01:20:06,980 --> 01:20:11,980
And if you don't remember, when Smurfette showed up, she had black hair and had a heart of coal.

1153
01:20:11,980 --> 01:20:13,980
Okay, this is what 23rd Magus is elaborating.

1154
01:20:13,980 --> 01:20:15,980
Then they elaborated and she became good.

1155
01:20:15,980 --> 01:20:17,980
Okay, 23rd Magus is answering some of your questions here.

1156
01:20:17,980 --> 01:20:23,980
Okay, he can't go before school, can't make it, for whatever reason, so he has to go during lunch, which means he cannot eat.

1157
01:20:23,980 --> 01:20:26,980
Either I give up lunch or I give up graduating.

1158
01:20:26,980 --> 01:20:28,980
I don't buy it, take it to the PTA.

1159
01:20:28,980 --> 01:20:35,980
I mean not that I don't believe you, but take it to PTA.

1160
01:20:58,980 --> 01:21:07,820

01:21:35,820 --> 01:21:41,260
the pads for them wow that's dedication right there shit

1169
01:21:41,260 --> 01:21:45,900
oh my god hey it's a novel

1170
01:21:45,900 --> 01:21:49,900
you people you people are raping this privilege all right

1171
01:21:49,900 --> 01:21:53,420
here we go snub this annoyed says big old fat f you that's an understatement

1172
01:21:53,420 --> 01:21:56,980
here, too. First off, fuck you to the people at CCL who decided that just because someone

1173
01:21:56,980 --> 01:21:59,860
stringed the machine for tons of credits, it was okay to hog the machine like a bunch

1174
01:21:59,860 --> 01:22:03,840
of motherfuckers. I had to wait 90 minutes for one fucking game of DDR and it was versus

1175
01:22:03,840 --> 01:22:08,940
with some pretentious and not very good little... The blanket is blank. Even I... That's too

1176
01:22:08,940 --> 01:22:11,940
dirty for me to read.

1177
01:22:11,940 --> 01:22:15,700
Oh my God.

1178
01:22:15,700 --> 01:22:20,860
Little cum in his shit asshole. It made me play on the two-player pads which sucked Major

1179
01:22:20,860 --> 01:22:36,860
Secondly, fuck you to CCL for not fixing the two-player pads for so long. I understand that it's hard to repair the pads when people string the machine so excessively, but it's been about two months now and the down and right arrows don't work unless you weigh 400 pounds, so fuck them for having such shitty pads.

1180
01:22:36,860 --> 01:22:43,860
okay well i've never met that doesn't know what you're wearing out

1181
01:22:52,260 --> 01:22:53,860
i have no idea should

1182
01:22:53,860 --> 01:22:57,660
the offline or so i'd like to have this horrible radio their wife

1183
01:22:57,660 --> 01:23:00,980
watch those cameras and they have like

1184
01:23:00,980 --> 01:23:03,300
when cameras

1185
01:23:03,300 --> 01:23:06,300
They're like those fake ones you buy at the store, the candy cameras.

1186
01:23:07,300 --> 01:23:15,300
They have them. All you can see, though, are like the lights of the speakers and the talk. You can't see anywhere down on the bottom.

1187
01:23:15,300 --> 01:23:19,300
They're saying clips that people usually try to be honest and they think they're being watched.

1188
01:23:19,300 --> 01:23:20,300
Very true.

1189
01:23:22,300 --> 01:23:27,300
Third, fuck the dumb little bitches that decided to drive on the shoulder in their Mustang and then merge with traffic.

1190
01:23:27,300 --> 01:23:29,300
Somebody did that to me the other day. I hate that.

1191
01:23:29,300 --> 01:23:33,300
Almost fucking slamming into us. I hate to call anyone a bitch, but they fucking deserved it.

1192
01:23:33,300 --> 01:23:37,300
And after almost slamming into us, they laughed like giddy-ass schoolgirls. Fuck you.

1193
01:23:39,300 --> 01:23:42,300
You know, I have an execution on that. Fuck big trucks.

1194
01:23:42,300 --> 01:23:44,300
Who tried to run you off the road?

1195
01:23:46,300 --> 01:23:47,300
Yeah.

1196
01:23:47,300 --> 01:23:51,300
And finally, fuck you to the Queen Kong gorilla girl that fucking butchered my hair.

1197
01:23:51,300 --> 01:23:54,300
If my hair slips through your fingers, don't cut my fucking hair, please.

1198
01:23:54,300 --> 01:23:56,040
Please I asked for a trim

1199
01:23:56,040 --> 01:24:01,580
So I don't look like a hobo while keeping my sort of sideburns and I get half my fucking hair shaved off

1200
01:24:01,580 --> 01:24:07,300
I don't have sideburns and my head looked like a fucking mushroom for three weeks. Fuck that. Well, there you go

1201
01:24:07,300 --> 01:24:09,300
Did you see anyone that look like a mushroom zero?

1202
01:24:10,060 --> 01:24:12,060
I

1203
01:24:12,060 --> 01:24:21,260
I think this is a new person listening to the show, so hello to Ninja Usaki Koi, which

1204
01:24:21,260 --> 01:24:23,260
means bunny, does it?

1205
01:24:23,260 --> 01:24:29,020
Yes, either that's koyos in love or koyos in fish.

1206
01:24:29,020 --> 01:24:30,500
What about Usaki, is that bunny?

1207
01:24:30,500 --> 01:24:31,500
Is that bunny love?

1208
01:24:31,500 --> 01:24:32,500
Ninja Bunny love?

1209
01:24:32,500 --> 01:24:33,500
Ninja Bunny love.

1210
01:24:33,500 --> 01:24:34,500
Awesome.

1211
01:24:34,500 --> 01:24:35,500
That's cool.

1212
01:24:35,500 --> 01:24:39,620
I love my, my sister would love you because my sister is a total bunny addict.

1213
01:24:39,620 --> 01:24:58,620
I want to send an F.U. to my friend for playing Involuntary Twister with me on DDR.

1214
01:24:58,620 --> 01:25:02,900
JB says my F.U. goes to SyFam having to be in Italy so it will take forever for my customized

1215
01:25:02,900 --> 01:25:04,300
CD order form to get there.

1216
01:25:04,300 --> 01:25:08,300
and FU to the Safari Trance mix for Jamie sounding blah.

1217
01:25:08,300 --> 01:25:11,300
Send it to me anyway. Send me what you have Safari.

1218
01:25:11,300 --> 01:25:15,300
If you can't mix Safari to Trance, it doesn't work. It's like Jungle in the Trance.

1219
01:25:15,300 --> 01:25:20,300
Actually, I want to make a suggestion for a new monthly contest.

1220
01:25:20,300 --> 01:25:22,300
What's that? We haven't even finished the rules for our other one.

1221
01:25:22,300 --> 01:25:27,300
Let's finish this one though, but I have a really good idea. Finish it like we first did.

1222
01:25:27,300 --> 01:25:28,300
OK.

1223
01:25:28,300 --> 01:25:32,300
Vidpowah says, FU to Cartoon Heroes for being hard. I agree.

1224
01:25:32,300 --> 01:25:36,220
F you to teachers who yell at your class when you haven't done anything wrong.

1225
01:25:36,220 --> 01:25:37,220
F you to homework.

1226
01:25:37,220 --> 01:25:38,220
F you to research papers.

1227
01:25:38,220 --> 01:25:41,860
And finally, F you to people who vandalize apartments that your family owns.

1228
01:25:41,860 --> 01:25:44,700
Luckily, no one lives in those apartments.

1229
01:25:44,700 --> 01:25:48,260
Too much crime in Vegas.

1230
01:25:48,260 --> 01:25:50,580
The OSFBB says fuck you to every new program.

1231
01:25:50,580 --> 01:25:54,820
For some reason, they always find the stupidest fucking person to talk to.

1232
01:25:54,820 --> 01:25:56,460
Okay.

1233
01:25:56,460 --> 01:25:58,020
Okay.

1234
01:25:58,020 --> 01:26:05,020
and

1235
01:26:08,700 --> 01:26:10,700
and

1236
01:26:10,700 --> 01:26:15,700
even though he is one of the people who don't know what being a true friend is

1237
01:26:15,700 --> 01:26:22,700
yeah

1238
01:26:22,700 --> 01:26:29,540
Well, I'll tell you my suggestion during one of the breaks, and we'll see if it's...

1239
01:26:29,540 --> 01:26:30,540
Okay, we'll do that.

1240
01:26:30,540 --> 01:26:32,540
In fact, we'll go ahead and take a quick break right now.

1241
01:26:32,540 --> 01:26:36,820
I'm going to bring up some shirt that Yosef Vibi gave me a site, and we'll look at that

1242
01:26:36,820 --> 01:26:38,460
during the break, too.

1243
01:26:38,460 --> 01:26:42,460
And we got the second half of the Cyberbeat stuff, the post-Freestyle interview is coming

1244
01:26:42,460 --> 01:26:43,460
up.

1245
01:26:43,460 --> 01:26:44,880
Those should be very interesting.

1246
01:26:44,880 --> 01:26:48,140
In the meantime, we're going to take a quick break, and we'll start it off with, I don't

1247
01:26:48,140 --> 01:26:49,140
know, what?

1248
01:26:49,140 --> 01:26:50,140
What should we hear, Jamie?

1249
01:26:50,140 --> 01:26:51,140
You know what?

1250
01:26:51,140 --> 01:26:55,140
Um, you know what? How about in celebration of my very first seven star?

1251
01:26:55,140 --> 01:26:56,140
Oh, okay.

1252
01:26:56,140 --> 01:26:57,140
Please don't go.

1253
01:26:57,140 --> 01:27:01,140
Oh, god, I hope I have it. Uh, I know I do. I know I do. I know I do.

1254
01:27:01,140 --> 01:27:03,140
I know I do somewhere.

1255
01:27:03,140 --> 01:27:04,140
Okay, we'll do that.

1256
01:27:04,140 --> 01:27:05,140
Alright.

1257
01:27:05,140 --> 01:27:07,140
Alright, we'll be back

1258
01:27:35,140 --> 01:27:39,140
but this is how I grew up

1259
01:27:39,140 --> 01:27:42,140
I got to let it be

1260
01:27:43,140 --> 01:27:45,140
I got to let it be

1261
01:27:46,140 --> 01:27:49,140
Oh yeah, let it be

01:27:50,140 --> 01:27:52,140
I got to let it be

01:27:52,140 --> 01:27:54,140
I got to let it be

1264
01:27:54,140 --> 01:27:56,140

Yeah, hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

1282
01:31:13,520 --> 01:31:17,120
The night is hot, I think I'm gonna have some fun

1283
01:31:17,120 --> 01:31:20,720
It's twelve o'clock, but looks like the party's begun

1284
01:31:20,720 --> 01:31:24,480
Just send a club, tonight I'm gonna make my move

1285
01:31:24,480 --> 01:31:28,080
When I saw you, I knew exactly what to do

1286
01:31:28,080 --> 01:31:31,840
I go up, I go down, face my head all around

1287
01:31:31,840 --> 01:31:35,340
It's your eyes, it's your style, I wanna make it mine

1306
01:33:22,080 --> 01:33:25,320
it's a front and back shirt on the front it says there's two people fucking on

1307
01:33:25,320 --> 01:33:28,180

1308
01:33:28,180 --> 01:33:32,440

1309
01:33:32,440 --> 01:33:36,960
it's great and then the other one or some of the other ones that were funny

1310
01:33:36,960 --> 01:33:40,600

01:33:40,600 --> 01:33:43,600
Why don't you just suck my dick?

1312
01:33:43,600 --> 01:33:45,220
Go to the ones that are worse than hell.

1313
01:33:45,220 --> 01:33:47,140
I want to see what the really bad ones are.

1314
01:33:47,140 --> 01:33:53,360
These are the bad ones.

1315
01:33:53,360 --> 01:33:58,900
I used to listen to NSYNC when they were in Underground.

1316
01:33:58,900 --> 01:34:00,140
Homosexuals are gay.

1317
01:34:00,140 --> 01:34:05,140
You fucked my mother?

1318
01:34:05,140 --> 01:34:09,140
I want the shirt that says, Even Jesus Hates Creed.

1319
01:34:09,140 --> 01:34:10,740
I like that, Even Jesus Hates Creed.

1320
01:34:10,740 --> 01:34:13,260
That's great.

1321
01:34:13,260 --> 01:34:14,460
Guns don't kill people.

1322
01:34:14,460 --> 01:34:15,500
Mario Van Peebles.

1323
01:34:19,020 --> 01:34:20,740

I want to see the really bad ones.

1327
01:34:25,100 --> 01:34:25,940
I want to see the really bad ones.

1328
01:34:25,940 --> 01:34:27,820
Because there's a section called, Worse Than Hell.

1329
01:34:27,820 --> 01:34:28,700
Let's look at these here.

1330
01:34:28,700 --> 01:34:29,540
Ooh, it's purple.

1331
01:34:29,540 --> 01:34:33,180

01:35:09,960 --> 01:35:14,020

Yeah, that one's really bad, Loki.

1343
01:35:19,500 --> 01:35:22,220
If you go to the site, you'll know which one we're talking about. It just starts with

1344
01:35:22,220 --> 01:35:24,840
I hate... and has this whole list.

1345
01:35:24,840 --> 01:35:28,860
That's just too much. Although the punchline's really funny.

1346
01:35:28,860 --> 01:35:32,500

1347
01:35:32,500 --> 01:35:34,700

1356
01:36:15,100 --> 01:36:22,140
Now that Jesus did it for the chicks one, I should buy that shirt and wear it to my

1357
01:36:22,140 --> 01:36:23,140
old church.

1358
01:36:23,140 --> 01:36:24,140

01:36:56,180 --> 01:36:59,180

01:36:59,180 --> 01:37:02,180
Fuck the milk, where's the whiskey tits?

1373
01:37:02,180 --> 01:37:05,180
My IQ is higher than the president's.

1374
01:37:05,180 --> 01:37:08,180
I shit my pants and all I got is a lovely t-shirt.

1375
01:37:08,180 --> 01:37:09,180
Broken cotton.

1376
01:37:09,180 --> 01:37:11,180
That's awful!

1377
01:37:11,180 --> 01:37:13,180
Are you kidnapped?

1378
01:37:13,180 --> 01:37:16,180
Are you my daddy?

1379
01:37:16,180 --> 01:37:18,180
I keep these bigger than yours.

1380
01:37:18,180 --> 01:37:21,180
I hide in my crack in my diaper.

1381
01:37:21,180 --> 01:37:24,180
did you say I hide in my crack in my diaper?

1382
01:37:24,180 --> 01:37:26,180
I hide my crack in my diaper.

1383
01:37:26,180 --> 01:37:28,180
Oh my God. Alright alright alright alright.

1384
01:37:28,180 --> 01:37:31,180
Enough with t-shirt Hell.

1385
01:37:31,180 --> 01:37:34,180
What were we gonna talk about? What were we gonna talk about when we came back?

1386
01:37:34,180 --> 01:37:36,180
Oh you wanna talk about some contest I...

1387
01:37:36,180 --> 01:37:37,180
Big Black Calk.

1388
01:37:37,180 --> 01:37:39,180
You wanna talk about the contest now or are we gonna wait until we wrap up the other contest?

1389
01:37:39,180 --> 01:37:41,180
We're gonna wrap up the contest first though, right?

1390
01:37:41,180 --> 01:37:43,180
We should start it next month I think.

1391
01:37:43,180 --> 01:37:47,180
We're going to have the remix challenge.

1392
01:37:47,180 --> 01:37:56,020
Where we give you a song, and we give you a style, and you need to remix the song in

1393
01:37:56,020 --> 01:37:57,740
the style.

1394
01:37:57,740 --> 01:38:02,940
And we will give points to people, and we're going to have this running for a whole year.

1395
01:38:02,940 --> 01:38:03,940
Okay?

1396
01:38:03,940 --> 01:38:05,900
So we're going to hear all kinds of neat stuff.

1397
01:38:05,900 --> 01:38:09,620
You have a month to finish your particular mix.

1398
01:38:09,620 --> 01:38:13,040
Like the one, the last challenge that I gave out, we'll go ahead and extend it.

1399
01:38:13,040 --> 01:38:14,540
The Safari Trance mix.

1400
01:38:14,540 --> 01:38:15,540
Sick.

1401
01:38:15,540 --> 01:38:20,540
You know, we could do Remember Me, Happy Hardcore.

1402
01:38:20,540 --> 01:38:22,540
Or not.

1403
01:38:22,540 --> 01:38:23,540
How about a good song?

1404
01:38:23,540 --> 01:38:26,540
No, actually, on 2DX, that's a favorite song of mine to play, actually.

1405
01:38:26,540 --> 01:38:27,540
It's Remember You.

1406
01:38:27,540 --> 01:38:29,540
Although it is really, really, really easy.

1407
01:38:29,540 --> 01:38:30,540
Not Remember You, Remember Me.

1408
01:38:30,540 --> 01:38:31,540
Oh, I don't remember.

1409
01:38:31,540 --> 01:38:33,540
But it'll be.

1410
01:38:33,540 --> 01:38:34,540
That really slow one.

1411
01:38:34,540 --> 01:38:36,540
Yeah, you know which song I'm talking about.

1412
01:38:36,540 --> 01:38:39,540
It's fun to play, although it is really insanely easy.

1413
01:38:39,540 --> 01:38:41,540
It's just kind of, I don't know, it's a good, it's fun to play.

1414
01:38:41,540 --> 01:38:42,540
But DDR, no.

1415
01:38:42,540 --> 01:38:43,540
It's awful on DDR.

1416
01:38:43,540 --> 01:38:47,060
But we'll offer this.

1417
01:38:47,060 --> 01:38:50,500
We're going to give out points based on how well your mix is.

1418
01:38:50,500 --> 01:38:53,060
Whoever has the best, the highest number of points

1419
01:38:53,060 --> 01:38:55,340
at the end of the year gets a fabulous prize.

1420
01:38:55,340 --> 01:38:56,920
And I'm not talking about a shit prize.

1421
01:38:56,920 --> 01:38:58,540
I'm talking about fabulous.

1422
01:38:58,540 --> 01:39:00,220
We don't know what kind of fabulous prize.

1423
01:39:00,220 --> 01:39:01,780
Well, I mean, it is a year away.

1424
01:39:01,780 --> 01:39:03,460
If we put up enough money, you can

1425
01:39:03,460 --> 01:39:06,980
get one of those nice DJ in the boxes for like $400 or $300.

1426
01:39:06,980 --> 01:39:08,980
And it's got two turntables and a mixing board.

1427
01:39:08,980 --> 01:39:09,480
Fuck that.

1428
01:39:09,480 --> 01:39:12,380
If I'm buying one of those, I'm buying it for me.

1429
01:39:12,380 --> 01:39:15,380
I was hoping it was going to be for me, but whatever. Anyways, yeah.

1430
01:39:15,380 --> 01:39:19,380
Yes, and even hosts can participate, because I'm grading.

1431
01:39:19,380 --> 01:39:23,380
So it's all going to be Jamie grading? So I can enter the remixes?

1432
01:39:23,380 --> 01:39:24,380
It'll be me and a panel.

1433
01:39:24,380 --> 01:39:28,380
Oh, okay. You and a panel. A panel of what?

1434
01:39:28,380 --> 01:39:31,380
Can you get negative scores?

1435
01:39:31,380 --> 01:39:34,380
If it's really bad, yeah. If it's twin, yeah.

1436
01:39:34,380 --> 01:39:37,380
I was waiting for someone to say that.

1437
01:39:37,380 --> 01:39:40,380
I wonder if you can get negative scores, because mine's so bad.

1438
01:39:40,380 --> 01:39:43,380
I don't know. I've heard pretty bad. We've heard pretty bad.

1439
01:39:43,380 --> 01:39:46,380
But anyway, we'll start this up next month.

1440
01:39:46,380 --> 01:39:50,380
But first we've got to finish the rules for our DWI contest we're going to be doing.

1441
01:39:50,380 --> 01:39:52,380
That's still going on too.

1442
01:39:52,380 --> 01:39:58,380
That's still going on, but we really haven't announced the official rules because we've been lazy and out of town and what have you, drunk, whatever.

1443
01:39:58,380 --> 01:40:01,380
But we'll have the full details on that next week, we swear.

1444
01:40:01,380 --> 01:40:07,380
The DWI contest where all the DWIs must be to old school TV themes.

1445
01:40:07,380 --> 01:40:15,380
yes no remixes no movies just TV themes didn't we say we were gonna allow movies

1446
01:40:15,380 --> 01:40:20,420
I don't know okay no movies well we'll have the full rules for you next week

1447
01:40:20,420 --> 01:40:23,820
I'm personally looking forward to seeing one done to the greatest American hero

1448
01:40:23,820 --> 01:40:29,420
not that you're hinting what's going to get your vote

1449
01:40:29,420 --> 01:40:33,420
I'm actually going to vote for it.

1450
01:40:33,420 --> 01:40:35,420
It should be excluded.

1451
01:40:35,420 --> 01:40:36,420
Shut up.

1452
01:40:36,420 --> 01:40:37,420
Shut up, Intern.

1453
01:40:37,420 --> 01:40:38,420
You're for fun.

1454
01:40:38,420 --> 01:40:39,420
Shut up, Intern.

1455
01:40:39,420 --> 01:40:41,660
Oh, so now Zero X is the official Intern of...

1456
01:40:41,660 --> 01:40:42,660
He's our Intern.

1457
01:40:42,660 --> 01:40:43,660
Okay, cool.

1458
01:40:43,660 --> 01:40:44,660
Because Black Lab is...

1459
01:40:44,660 --> 01:40:48,700
I'm sorry, puppy, is our foreign correspondent from the People's Republic of Davis.

1460
01:40:48,700 --> 01:40:49,940
He's also our PR bitch.

1461
01:40:49,940 --> 01:40:51,820
Yes, our PR bitch.

1462
01:40:51,820 --> 01:40:53,660
And so now we have Zero as our Intern.

1463
01:40:53,660 --> 01:40:55,620
Who else do we have to have a title on this show?

1464
01:40:55,620 --> 01:40:56,620

1465
01:40:56,620 --> 01:40:57,620

01:41:23,160 --> 01:41:25,720
then we'll come back and do the second half of the interviews while we tally

1472
01:41:25,720 --> 01:41:52,720
Well, we play songs. Each of us picks one. Whichever one went last week, of course, the person who chose that song does not get to choose a new one. And you, the chatroom, vote on what you think is best and it goes into rotation for a week.

1473
01:41:52,720 --> 01:41:55,420
goes irritation during our money is more

1474
01:41:55,420 --> 01:41:57,660
yeah always on this channel we're not here

1475
01:41:57,660 --> 01:41:58,940
in the front going

1476
01:41:58,940 --> 01:42:02,080
implore or i did a fuck-up this week for the first time in like two weeks

1477
01:42:02,080 --> 01:42:05,520
so was a little too you know what i would like to meet with

1478
01:42:05,520 --> 01:42:09,560
yeah you're you're you are a fuck-up or for a while

1479
01:42:09,560 --> 01:42:12,800
we just like

1480
01:42:12,800 --> 01:42:15,640
last week on orange lunch radio okay so let's

1481
01:42:15,640 --> 01:42:19,680
get into the cage match

1482
01:42:19,680 --> 01:42:21,140
last week

1483
01:42:21,140 --> 01:42:23,700
on the cage match, actually two weeks ago.

1484
01:42:23,700 --> 01:42:27,560
But you guys didn't do a cage match last week I'm assuming?

1485
01:42:27,560 --> 01:42:31,580
OK, so last time we did the cage match, so by default, the winner from two weeks ago

1486
01:42:31,580 --> 01:42:34,520
won last week just by default. There was no cage match.

1487
01:42:34,520 --> 01:42:39,520
So this is two weeks in a row now, going for its third victory.

1488
01:42:39,520 --> 01:42:44,460
And, honestly, between you and me, I think this is going to be the first song that has to be retired

1489
01:42:44,460 --> 01:42:48,900
after four weeks. I just think it's gonna, just because it happens to be a host

1490
01:42:48,900 --> 01:42:54,740
involved with the creation of it I don't think it's ever gonna lose but boost my

1491
01:42:54,740 --> 01:42:59,340
ego some more that's enough you don't need no more but we have some we have

1492
01:42:59,340 --> 01:43:04,100
some worthy challengers tonight you know why this is what we decided to do I think

1493
01:43:04,100 --> 01:43:12,540
Jamie did this too right we let other people pick our songs this week yep so

1494
01:43:12,540 --> 01:43:18,820
other people picked our songs for this week so anyway let's talk about last

1495
01:43:18,820 --> 01:43:22,620
last week's winner. This is the first song that you can vote for. Oh yeah, after we play

1496
01:43:22,620 --> 01:43:26,580
we will not accept votes until the end of the third song. Once the end of the third

1501
01:43:46,340 --> 01:43:51,540
week two weeks ago is winner this is Loki with the legend of trance we're

1502
01:43:51,540 --> 01:43:58,540
just gonna play a small clip of it.

1503
01:44:51,540 --> 01:45:10,380
Alright, that's last week's winner from two weeks ago, that's the Legend of Trance, kind

1504
01:45:10,380 --> 01:45:12,660
of a remix of Legend of Max.

1505
01:45:12,660 --> 01:45:16,820
And Loki, why don't you explain how that was created for those that are just joining us,

1506
01:45:16,820 --> 01:45:17,820
never heard that one before?

1507
01:45:17,820 --> 01:45:21,060
That was all with Acid 3 Pro.

1508
01:45:21,060 --> 01:45:23,780
And what possessed you to make that mix?

1509
01:45:23,780 --> 01:45:27,260
I don't know, I don't know, I just wanted to make a remix of something and I was like

1510
01:45:27,260 --> 01:45:28,580
eh, I'll try that.

1511
01:45:28,580 --> 01:45:29,580
I want a sip.

1512
01:45:29,580 --> 01:45:30,580
I want a sip.

1513
01:45:30,580 --> 01:45:31,580
Of it.

1514
01:45:31,580 --> 01:45:32,580
Because I haven't tried this yet.

1515
01:45:32,580 --> 01:45:33,580
Yes, I don't know.

1516
01:45:33,580 --> 01:45:34,580
It just, I thought about doing that.

1517
01:45:34,580 --> 01:45:40,460
I'm working on either, now I was trying to do a Dynamite Rave one, something like that.

1518
01:45:40,460 --> 01:45:44,540
Something trancy, but it's just not, it's not very, it just doesn't work.

1519
01:45:44,540 --> 01:45:46,220
It's not sounding too good.

1520
01:45:46,220 --> 01:45:53,220
So I'm looking at right now, probably going to be doing a Dark Black Forest one, and there

1521
01:45:53,220 --> 01:45:57,820
was another one I was looking at doing. I can't remember. Oh, the Dark Black Forest

1522
01:45:57,820 --> 01:46:00,420
was one of them, though, for sure.

1523
01:46:00,420 --> 01:46:06,060
All right. Next up, let's play my pick for this week. However, my pick is actually coming

1524
01:46:06,060 --> 01:46:10,940
from someone else this week, because I knew nothing I picked was going to be Loki's winner

1525
01:46:10,940 --> 01:46:15,940
from a couple weeks ago. So Dark Tetsuya wanted me to put this one in. It's one of his favorite

1526
01:46:15,940 --> 01:46:33,940
Love of the Angel

1527
01:46:45,940 --> 01:47:04,940
The stories ending, they will take my life Saying you can never, are fighting in my mind

1528
01:47:04,940 --> 01:47:09,940
I'm missing love, believe me I'm with someone

1529
01:47:09,940 --> 01:47:13,940
Wish you loved me, oh pretty girl

1530
01:47:13,940 --> 01:47:16,940
Why you expect to fall in love

1531
01:47:16,940 --> 01:47:18,940
You take me to the store

1532
01:47:18,940 --> 01:47:21,940
You cover the edges

1533
01:47:21,940 --> 01:47:25,940
Like a bright light in my mind

1534
01:47:25,940 --> 01:47:28,940
You're taking my life

1535
01:47:28,940 --> 01:47:32,940
To the top to feel alright

1536
01:48:02,940 --> 01:48:11,940
I'm taking my life

1537
01:48:11,940 --> 01:48:39,220
p0k3smot42o

1538
01:48:39,220 --> 01:48:42,220
Sorry about that. Well, the interviews are all queued up now.

1539
01:48:42,220 --> 01:48:44,220
We'll get to that after the gauge votes.

1540
01:48:44,220 --> 01:48:49,220
Alright, that was KK, KK, Jungle Girls, I don't remember their full name.

1541
01:48:49,220 --> 01:48:50,220
Kong.

1542
01:48:50,220 --> 01:48:52,220
DJ Kong, thank you.

1543
01:48:52,220 --> 01:48:55,220
King Kong and Jungle Girls, with Love of the Angel.

1544
01:48:55,220 --> 01:48:57,220
The Jungle Girls.

1545
01:48:57,220 --> 01:49:01,220
That wasn't a bad tune, I liked it. Let's go around and see everybody else's thoughts.

1546
01:49:01,220 --> 01:49:02,220
6.

1547
01:49:02,220 --> 01:49:04,220
Sorry, we had the music full volume there. Sorry about that.

1548
01:49:04,220 --> 01:49:06,220
Let's go around and get everyone else's thoughts on that song.

1549
01:49:06,220 --> 01:49:10,220
80's Fabulous, but not 80's Fabulous Enough.

1550
01:49:11,220 --> 01:49:21,220
I don't know, I give it a 7. It was pretty good for what it was supposed to sound like, but it wasn't nothing that really caught my eye.

1551
01:49:22,220 --> 01:49:28,220
6. He should have called himself King Dong and His Bitches. He would have gotten a higher score that way.

1552
01:49:28,220 --> 01:49:34,220
I'd actually go ahead and give it an 8 because I think it'll be a pretty decent DDR song. It'll be pretty cool in DDR.

1553
01:49:34,220 --> 01:49:40,220
And, uh, you know, I have a feeling, just because there's some meanings behind this for some folks at Chaurum,

1554
01:49:40,220 --> 01:49:45,220
there might be some votes coming at this way for Love of the Angels, so, who knows?

1555
01:49:45,220 --> 01:49:51,220
I think they're trying to- I think they're- they're trying everything they can to dethrone Legend of Trance.

1556
01:49:51,220 --> 01:49:57,220
Alright, oh. Jamie's gonna bring it. Alright, Jamie, what are you bringing to the cage match tonight?

1557
01:49:57,220 --> 01:50:03,220
Alright, this was my favorite Belinda Carlile song, Heaven is a Place on Earth.

1558
01:50:03,220 --> 01:50:06,220
This is a remix by Wildside.

1559
01:50:06,220 --> 01:50:09,220
Alright, this is Wildside with Heaven is a Place on Earth.

1560
01:50:09,220 --> 01:50:13,220
Jamie's pick for this week's cage match. Enjoy.

1561
01:50:13,220 --> 01:50:16,220
Ooh baby do you know that's where

1562
01:50:16,220 --> 01:50:18,220
Ooh heaven is a place on earth

1563
01:50:18,220 --> 01:50:21,220
This ain't heaven, love comes first

1564
01:50:21,220 --> 01:50:24,220
We'll make heaven out of place on earth

1565
01:50:24,220 --> 01:50:29,220
Ooh, heaven is a place on earth

1566
01:50:54,220 --> 01:51:00,220
Ooh, heaven is a place on earth

1567
01:51:10,220 --> 01:51:13,220
When the night falls down

1568
01:51:13,220 --> 01:51:16,220
I'll be forty and just come around

1569
01:51:16,220 --> 01:51:19,220
And the world of light

1570
01:51:19,220 --> 01:51:22,220
Unlucky, on the seat I slide

1571
01:51:22,220 --> 01:51:28,220
Then walked into the room As you pull me close, I will start to move

1572
01:51:28,220 --> 01:51:33,220
And we're standing with the stars above And lift me up in a wave of love

1573
01:51:33,220 --> 01:51:38,220
Ooh, baby, send love back where Ooh, heaven is a place on earth

1574
01:51:38,220 --> 01:51:44,220
We say heaven, love comes first Don't make heaven out of space on earth

1575
01:51:44,220 --> 01:51:49,220
Ooh, heaven is based on us

1576
01:52:00,220 --> 01:52:03,220
When I feel love alone

1577
01:52:03,220 --> 01:52:06,220
I reach for you and you bring me home

1578
01:52:06,220 --> 01:52:09,220
When I'm lost at sea

1579
01:52:09,220 --> 01:52:12,220
I hear your voice and it scares me

1580
01:52:12,220 --> 01:52:15,220
In this world we're just beginning

1581
01:52:15,220 --> 01:52:18,220
To understand the marriage of babies

1582
01:52:18,220 --> 01:52:20,220
Maybe I was afraid we'd go

1583
01:52:20,220 --> 01:52:24,220
But I'm not afraid anymore

1584
01:52:24,220 --> 01:52:27,220
Ooh, baby, do you know that we're

1585
01:52:27,220 --> 01:52:30,220
Ooh, heaven is a place on earth

1586
01:52:30,220 --> 01:52:33,220
You say heaven loves conflict

1587
01:52:33,220 --> 01:52:36,220
No big heaven had a place on earth

1588
01:52:36,220 --> 01:52:38,220
Ooh, baby, do you know that we're

1589
01:52:38,220 --> 01:52:41,220
Ooh, heaven is a place on earth

1590
01:52:41,220 --> 01:52:47,220
We say heaven, love comes first Don't think heaven out of place on earth

1591
01:52:47,220 --> 01:52:52,220
Ooh, heaven is a place on earth

1592
01:52:52,220 --> 01:53:15,900
Ooh, heaven, you're safe on earth Ooh, baby, do you know that we're, we're,

1593
01:53:15,900 --> 01:53:21,500

1594
01:53:21,500 --> 01:53:23,500
Yeah, yeah, yeah

1595
01:53:51,500 --> 01:54:19,500
Ooh, baby, do you know that's where Ooh, heaven is a place on earth

1596
01:54:19,500 --> 01:54:43,620
Ooh, heaven is a place on earth Ooh, baby, do you know that's where we're

1597
01:54:43,620 --> 01:54:44,620
at?

1598
01:54:44,620 --> 01:54:47,620
Alrighty, that's the last pick.

1599
01:54:47,620 --> 01:54:51,620
Wildside with Heaven is a Place on Earth. Let's go around and get your thoughts on that. Jamie?

1600
01:54:51,620 --> 01:54:52,620
Ten.

1601
01:54:52,620 --> 01:54:55,620
I give it nine and it's very well redone.

1602
01:54:55,620 --> 01:54:58,620
I dislike speed mixes, so I will give it a seven.

1603
01:54:58,620 --> 01:55:03,620
But I have a DWI for it, so I give it a seven point five.

1604
01:55:03,620 --> 01:55:07,620
You know, that was pretty good. I'm beginning to like Wildside a lot.

1605
01:55:07,620 --> 01:55:12,620
If you didn't recognize the name at first, they're the same band that did Irresistible Men from DDR Extreme.

1606
01:55:12,620 --> 01:55:19,620
there

1607
01:55:19,860 --> 01:55:21,880
it was a pretty good mix i'll give it an eight

1608
01:55:21,880 --> 01:55:24,020
eight three eighties

1609
01:55:24,020 --> 01:55:26,340

01:56:49,260 --> 01:56:50,260
you covered.

1624
01:56:50,260 --> 01:56:51,900
We got you covered, alright.

1625
01:56:51,900 --> 01:56:54,260
Here we go, let's second half of the interviews.

1626
01:56:54,260 --> 01:56:59,740
Alright, it's 547pm on Sunday and they've just announced all the winners for Freestyle,

1627
01:56:59,740 --> 01:57:05,340
taking home Max 2 Machine, Bruce Leroy, and lots of great routines. Honestly, any of these

1628
01:57:05,340 --> 01:57:09,020
routines would have won a normal tournament. I'm going to go around and see if I can't

1629
01:57:09,020 --> 01:57:15,500
get some reaction from some folks. We'll see what we can get here. I'm standing here with

1630
01:57:15,500 --> 01:57:19,300
JP Money, who came in, I believe, 7th place, right, with this routine. Fabulous, fabulous

1631
01:57:19,300 --> 01:57:22,140
ending to your routine, by the way, with all the money. Where'd that idea come from?

1632
01:57:22,140 --> 01:57:29,140
Actually, that was brought to my attention by the minds of my, the people staying in

1633
01:57:29,140 --> 01:57:31,900
the room with my roommates there you go and that's what I was looking for and I

1634
01:57:31,900 --> 01:57:35,140
like you know I thought it was pretty diverse I'm like you know why not so

1635

Later. Alright, I'm staying here with the AJ Sweet Banana who's taking home 3rd place.

1642
01:58:07,260 --> 01:58:10,780
Awesome routine. Definitely would have been in my top 3, too. How'd you feel about today?

1643
01:58:10,780 --> 01:58:16,540
Pretty good. Not bad for a week's worth of procrastination, but yeah. A lot of stuff

1644
01:58:16,540 --> 01:58:21,660
here will be on eBay eventually, because I have a lot of it at home. But yeah, it's okay.

01:58:53,640 --> 01:58:56,640
Oh crap, that's the one you ought to have been cramming for, huh?

1659
01:58:56,640 --> 01:59:00,640
Yeah, and shout out to anyone who sees my iBook!

1660
01:59:00,640 --> 01:59:04,640
It has been stolen, and yeah, I lost my iBook here.

1661
01:59:04,640 --> 01:59:07,640
It's stolen from behind the pre-reg thing, but it's alright.

1662
01:59:07,640 --> 01:59:10,640
You know, I got something in return. It's all good. Yeah.

1663
01:59:10,640 --> 01:59:12,640
Alright, anything else you want to say to folks out there listening?

1664
01:59:12,640 --> 01:59:15,640
Uh, just if you're playing the game, have fun. That's all there is to it.

1665
01:59:15,640 --> 01:59:17,640
Alright, thanks. Have a good celebration tonight.

1666
01:59:17,640 --> 01:59:19,640
Alright, thanks.

1667
01:59:19,640 --> 01:59:21,640
Does anyone know if AJ found his iBook?

1668
01:59:21,640 --> 01:59:28,640
Let us know. We're curious because that sucks to have stuff stolen. Bad people.

1669
01:59:28,640 --> 01:59:31,640
Naughty.

1670
01:59:31,640 --> 01:59:35,640
All right, now we're talking to the winner. Say hello to Bruce Leroy, everybody.

1671
01:59:35,640 --> 01:59:37,640
Hey, everybody. What's going on?

1672
01:59:37,640 --> 01:59:38,640
How does it feel?

1673
01:59:38,640 --> 01:59:46,640
It feels amazing. I came out here and my first round was really kind of a disappointment for me.

1674
01:59:46,640 --> 01:59:54,320
I kind of choked a little bit and I knew I had to represent at this point and I had faith

1675
01:59:54,320 --> 01:59:55,320
in this routine.

1676
01:59:55,320 --> 02:00:00,360
Lookin' Up a Rock is a very fast song, it required a lot of dedication and it came through

1677
02:00:00,360 --> 02:00:05,600
and it came together and I didn't blank out like I did yesterday which was thank God for

1678
02:00:05,600 --> 02:00:10,040
that and everyone felt the moves, that was the main part.

1679
02:00:10,040 --> 02:00:14,400
The crowd felt me, that was the main thing that put me over the edge I think.

1680
02:00:14,400 --> 02:00:19,360
I filled the song, communicated with the song, and the song communicated through me, so that's

1681
02:00:19,360 --> 02:00:20,360
how I try to do it.

1682
02:00:20,360 --> 02:00:21,360
Definitely, I totally agree.

1683
02:00:21,360 --> 02:00:23,840
Was there anything that you did to prepare for today's routine?

1684
02:00:23,840 --> 02:00:24,840
Definitely.

1685
02:00:24,840 --> 02:00:30,200
I watched Sammy Davis Jr. was a tremendous influence, as was Fred Astaire and Gene Kelly.

1686
02:00:30,200 --> 02:00:33,840
I watched a lot of their footage, like Singin' in the Rain and stuff like that.

1687
02:00:33,840 --> 02:00:38,560
Yeah, and then throwing a bit of my own stuff, I really tried to fill the song, you know?

1688
02:00:38,560 --> 02:00:42,880
A lot of times people do routines and they'll fight the song with their moves, and you gotta

1689
02:00:42,880 --> 02:00:45,280
let the phone tell you what to do

1690
02:00:45,280 --> 02:00:48,280
another questionnaire is my what the hell you know that machine

1691
02:00:48,280 --> 02:00:52,640
uh... i'm gonna try not to get up to norcal put it in my apartment alton

1692

1693
02:00:56,640 --> 02:00:57,600

Yeah.

1711
02:01:36,400 --> 02:01:37,400
Keep going, Bruce.

1712
02:01:37,400 --> 02:01:38,400
Oh, my God.

1713
02:01:38,400 --> 02:01:39,400
Yes.

1714
02:01:39,400 --> 02:01:40,400
All right.

1715
02:01:40,400 --> 02:01:41,400
We'll be back.

1716
02:01:41,400 --> 02:01:42,400
Can you get a picture?

1717
02:01:42,400 --> 02:01:43,400
All right.

1718
02:01:43,400 --> 02:01:45,400
I'm sitting here with the Master 42, who came in second place.

1719
02:01:45,400 --> 02:01:46,400
How do you feel about today's tournament?

1720
02:01:46,400 --> 02:01:47,400
Oh, it was so much fun.

1721
02:01:47,400 --> 02:01:53,200
I'm just so glad that I got to compete here with everybody and got a chance to, for everyone,

1722
02:01:53,200 --> 02:01:58,880
and I got a chance for everyone to see the skills and just for, just to portray the event

1723
02:01:58,880 --> 02:02:02,760
here is just a lot of is everybody's every tournament and their performance

1724
02:02:02,760 --> 02:02:06,600
is really really strong they decided to go a little og with your team how'd you

1725
02:02:06,600 --> 02:02:09,840
go about picking your song well I I remember when I first started learning

1726
02:02:09,840 --> 02:02:14,120
about freestyling I downloaded videos off the internet and I saw this group

1727
02:02:14,120 --> 02:02:18,240
this Korean group called a team and they performed to this song and I thought it

1728
02:02:18,240 --> 02:02:21,960
was just the awesomest thing ever I was like oh my gosh that's incredible how

1729
02:02:21,960 --> 02:02:27,720
did they do that and so you and master 42 dark Sakura could be great friends

1730
02:02:27,720 --> 02:02:29,400
uh... class

1731
02:02:29,400 --> 02:02:32,060
but i think what we want to move from that video

1732
02:02:32,060 --> 02:02:35,800
but uh... and i just i just want a part of the senate dot right on so it's not

1733
02:02:35,800 --> 02:02:37,160
the right now i get it

1734
02:02:37,160 --> 02:02:38,360
we can do the price

1735
02:02:38,360 --> 02:02:41,600
i don't go home and play out here

1736
02:02:41,600 --> 02:02:44,000
i had an american version of the playstation

1737
02:02:44,000 --> 02:02:45,840
back to try to bring american

1738
02:02:45,840 --> 02:02:47,860
place that i think you are

1739
02:02:47,860 --> 02:02:51,480
to play here but i'd like a lot more than they would actually work i needed

1740
02:02:51,480 --> 02:02:55,400
the uh... japanese version of the are now i have that so now the next minute

1741
02:02:55,400 --> 02:02:57,400
I won't be in that same pickle.

1742
02:02:57,400 --> 02:02:58,400
Alright, so what's next for you?

1743
02:02:58,400 --> 02:02:59,400
Are you going to be doing tournaments?

1744
02:02:59,400 --> 02:03:00,400
Are you going to take a break?

1745
02:03:00,400 --> 02:03:01,400
More tournaments in the future?

1746
02:03:01,400 --> 02:03:04,400
Yeah, I heard there's a tournament coming up in July that has a freestyle aspect,

1747
02:03:04,400 --> 02:03:05,400
so I'm going to check that out.

1748
02:03:05,400 --> 02:03:07,400
I don't think it will be as big as CyberZone,

1749
02:03:07,400 --> 02:03:09,400
but it will be something to do, to look forward to.

1750
02:03:09,400 --> 02:03:10,400
Sounds good.

1751
02:03:10,400 --> 02:03:11,400
And how are you celebrating tonight?

1752
02:03:11,400 --> 02:03:12,400
I think some...

1753
02:03:12,400 --> 02:03:16,400
We speculate, by the way, that July tournament that Master 42 references

1754
02:03:16,400 --> 02:03:19,400
could possibly be like this, actually a really big tournament.

1755
02:03:19,400 --> 02:03:22,400
I think March Madness is going to be a qualifier.

1756
02:03:22,400 --> 02:03:24,400
Yeah, this might be a big deal.

1757
02:03:24,400 --> 02:03:27,400
But yeah, more details to come on that one.

1758
02:03:27,400 --> 02:03:29,400
Guys, we're going down to Roscoe's for Chicken and Waffles.

1759
02:03:29,400 --> 02:03:30,400
Roscoe!

1760
02:03:30,400 --> 02:03:32,400
Yeah, that's right, that's right!

1761
02:03:32,400 --> 02:03:35,400
We want, we want Roscoe's!

1762
02:03:35,400 --> 02:03:36,400
Yeah!

1763
02:03:36,400 --> 02:03:37,400
Yeah!

1764
02:03:37,400 --> 02:03:40,400
So I think we're going to head down there for some Chicken and Waffles.

1765
02:03:40,400 --> 02:03:42,400
Alright, anything else you want to say to the fine folks listening?

1766
02:03:42,400 --> 02:03:45,400
Just congratulations to everyone, and take up TDR.

1767
02:03:45,400 --> 02:03:48,400
You might feel funky at first, but it's the best game, like, in the world, man.

1768
02:03:48,400 --> 02:03:50,400
It gets you laid like you can't believe.

1769
02:03:50,400 --> 02:03:51,400
Totally, man.

1770
02:03:51,400 --> 02:03:52,400
It does?

1771
02:03:52,400 --> 02:03:53,400
What the hell am I doing wrong?

1772
02:03:53,400 --> 02:03:58,400
all right thanks for talking to us all right thanks a lot man

1773
02:03:58,400 --> 02:04:03,400
fucked up and he forgot to have the third place match

1774
02:04:03,400 --> 02:04:08,400
whoa that went into fremont interviews because i used the same tape there all right

1775
02:04:08,400 --> 02:04:12,400
that was it that was uh all the interviews that we did that night

1776
02:04:12,400 --> 02:04:17,400
and then right after that we headed over to roscos and in the special you're gonna actually

1777
02:04:17,400 --> 02:04:22,400
hear some stuff taped at roscos including uh you'll hear the waiter was

1778
02:04:22,400 --> 02:04:27,880
there and I believe, I don't remember if I got Wendell's speech or not. We did a shot,

1779
02:04:27,880 --> 02:04:32,840
we did maple syrup shots basically. Us at our table, we did shots because the waiter

1780
02:04:32,840 --> 02:04:36,340
gave us the idea. He was talking about crazy customers that did shots of it. We all did

1781
02:04:36,340 --> 02:04:42,240
a shot and did a toast. It was a beautiful moment. Roscoe's was actually one of the highlights.

1782
02:04:42,240 --> 02:04:50,240
It tasted like... Actually, Roscoe's was seriously one of the highlights of the trip. I mean,

1783
02:04:50,240 --> 02:04:53,000
tournament yeah whatever it's DDR tournament but Roscoe's wasn't like

1784
02:04:53,000 --> 02:04:57,440
everybody was there just having a good old time just party that's really what

1785
02:04:57,440 --> 02:05:01,680
it was all about the hell with the tournament

1786
02:05:01,680 --> 02:05:07,400
Roscoe's is the shit did you see the pictures from Roscoe's you must go to

1787
02:05:07,400 --> 02:05:10,720
Roscoe's when you go down there I got sure when I was there for a X because we

1788
02:05:10,720 --> 02:05:14,760
were so busy although it was kind of funny walking into this little you know

1789
02:05:14,760 --> 02:05:22,020
a mom-and-pop diner wearing my Mad Hatter costume with my big black wings.

1790
02:05:22,020 --> 02:05:23,020
Very cool.

1791
02:05:23,020 --> 02:05:24,020
That was cool.

1792
02:05:24,020 --> 02:05:25,020
And all the white faces.

1793
02:05:25,020 --> 02:05:26,420
We literally took over like half of Roscoe's.

1794
02:05:26,420 --> 02:05:29,300
We had all the people, because this was a Sunday night, we had all the people on the

1795
02:05:29,300 --> 02:05:34,180
one side come back from church, come in and get their grits and their greens, and then

1796
02:05:34,180 --> 02:05:37,020
they had us just crazy kids there.

1797
02:05:37,020 --> 02:05:41,560
Are we going to go to a break?

1798
02:05:41,560 --> 02:05:45,020
We're gonna go to a break, and when we come back, we'll announce the winner of this week's

1799
02:05:45,020 --> 02:05:49,140
cage match, and, uh, yeah.

1800
02:05:49,140 --> 02:05:50,140
Won't that be exciting?

1801
02:05:50,140 --> 02:05:51,140
It'll be.

1802
02:05:51,140 --> 02:05:52,140
I'm stretching for time.

1803
02:05:52,140 --> 02:05:55,520
Loki, say something to stretch time here while I load up something for the break.

1804
02:05:55,520 --> 02:05:56,520
Say something?

1805
02:05:56,520 --> 02:05:57,520
Yeah, something.

1806
02:05:57,520 --> 02:05:58,520
Uh...

1807
02:05:58,520 --> 02:05:59,520
Your mom.

1808
02:05:59,520 --> 02:06:04,320
Alright, we'll play the song that won the tournament.

1809
02:06:04,320 --> 02:06:06,280
Bruce Leroy used this song for his routine.

1810
02:06:06,280 --> 02:06:07,280
It rules.

1811
02:06:07,280 --> 02:06:08,760
Uh, great.

1812
02:06:08,760 --> 02:06:09,760
Great routine.

1813
02:06:09,760 --> 02:06:11,760
Take it and go rock!

1814
02:06:11,760 --> 02:06:12,760
that's the end of the show.

1815
02:06:12,760 --> 02:06:13,760
I'll see you in the next one.

1816
02:06:13,760 --> 02:06:14,760
Thanks for watching and I'll see you next time.

1817
02:07:44,760 --> 02:07:46,760
You're on the run

1818
02:07:46,760 --> 02:07:48,760
You're on the run

1819
02:09:18,760 --> 02:09:25,760
Let's get down to the night, come on, I wanna get down

1820
02:09:25,760 --> 02:09:33,760
Oh yeah, let's get down to the night, come on, gotta get on down

1821
02:09:33,760 --> 02:09:36,760
Cool, like a gangster ham, JT player's ready to swing

1822
02:09:36,760 --> 02:09:38,760
You see the bounce and now the funk move the crowd

1823
02:09:38,760 --> 02:09:40,760
If you win it, let me hear it, if you win it, don't doubt

1824
02:09:40,760 --> 02:09:42,760
We hittin', tell me who be the crew

1825
02:09:42,760 --> 02:09:44,760
Who be the crowd like it's comin' on through JB

1826
02:09:44,760 --> 02:09:47,760
With the JT vibe from the 80's, you know how it goes

1827
02:09:47,760 --> 02:09:48,760
celebration, babe

1828
02:09:48,760 --> 02:09:50,120
How about it, I'll rub up the bag

1829
02:09:50,120 --> 02:09:51,800
I'm about to be the fool and see what

1830
02:09:51,800 --> 02:09:53,220
Yeah, ain't you going to be doing it

1831
02:09:53,220 --> 02:09:54,380
Here like some kinda slicker

1832
02:09:54,380 --> 02:09:56,380
Yo, J.P. got the false touch of his fingers

1833
02:09:56,380 --> 02:10:00,260
J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J

1834
02:10:00,260 --> 02:10:04,080
Yeah, let's get down to the lawn

1835
02:10:04,080 --> 02:10:07,080
I wanna get down

1836
02:10:07,080 --> 02:10:11,380
Oh yeah, let's get down to the lawn

1837
02:10:11,380 --> 02:10:14,700
We gotta get down

1838
02:10:14,700 --> 02:10:44,020
Alright, if you didn't recognize those, those are the top

1839
02:10:44,020 --> 02:10:50,420
Three freestyle songs right there first place was making a rock second place was brilliant to the orchestra groove and third place was let's get

1840
02:10:50,420 --> 02:10:54,120
Down those were the songs that the folks did their routines to and one cyber beat, okay?

1841
02:10:54,120 --> 02:10:58,080
We're gonna take things in a different direction now. We're gonna play a song from dance mania ex2

1842
02:10:58,080 --> 02:11:03,900
This is an interesting trance cover of your song. Let us know what you think of this is interesting when we come back

1843
02:11:03,900 --> 02:11:09,060
We're going to announce the winner of the cage match and this week's listless. It's going to be cool

1844
02:11:33,900 --> 02:12:02,380
It's a little bit funny, the street inside I'm not one of those who can, you're easily

1845
02:12:02,380 --> 02:12:17,380
I don't have much money, but boy, if I die, I'll die a big highway for me

1846
02:12:17,380 --> 02:12:38,380
I know it's not too much, but it's the best that I can do

1847
02:12:38,380 --> 02:12:46,380
I guess this is my moment, this moment for you

1848
02:12:46,380 --> 02:13:02,380
And you can tell everybody this is a song It may be quite simple, but I'll let you know

1849
02:13:02,380 --> 02:13:10,380
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind That I put you down in the wild

1850
02:13:10,380 --> 02:13:17,880
I wonder, if you're laughing, why you're in my mood

1851
02:13:17,880 --> 02:13:39,880
Get on the move, I can't stop them all

1852
02:13:39,880 --> 02:13:46,880
Well, a few other persons, well, they got me quite drunk

1853
02:13:46,880 --> 02:13:53,880
But there's somethin' quite right while I wrote this song

1854
02:13:53,880 --> 02:14:01,880
Just for people like you, babe, just to turn along

1855
02:14:01,880 --> 02:14:08,880
So you may forget, but these things are cool

1856
02:14:08,880 --> 02:14:15,880
You see a provider in their room, all their room

1857
02:14:15,880 --> 02:14:22,880
And we feel what I really need

1858
02:14:22,880 --> 02:14:30,880
You're not the sweetest eye I've ever seen

1859
02:14:30,880 --> 02:14:37,880
And you can tell everybody it's just a song

1860
02:14:37,880 --> 02:14:43,880
Can't wait to be acquired, I should be born, now that's done

1861
02:14:44,880 --> 02:14:47,880
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind

1862
02:14:47,880 --> 02:14:51,880
That I put you down in the world

1863
02:14:52,880 --> 02:14:55,880
I want love so highly

1864
02:14:55,880 --> 02:14:58,880
While you're in my world

1865
02:15:00,880 --> 02:15:04,880
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind

1866
02:15:04,880 --> 02:15:09,880
And I put them down and run

1867
02:15:09,880 --> 02:15:13,880
How wonderful I feel

1868
02:15:13,880 --> 02:15:18,880
Like you're in my world

1869
02:15:18,880 --> 02:15:30,880
Music

1870
02:15:30,880 --> 02:15:36,880
From the Step Squad to Orange Labs, this video sucks!

1871
02:15:36,880 --> 02:15:37,880
Holla!

1872
02:15:37,880 --> 02:15:38,880
Stop! Stop! Stop!

1873
02:15:38,880 --> 02:15:39,880
Stop! Stop!

1874
02:15:39,880 --> 02:15:40,880
You son of a bitch!

1875
02:15:40,880 --> 02:15:41,880
Back to site!

1876
02:15:41,880 --> 02:15:42,880
P.S.!

1877
02:15:42,880 --> 02:15:43,880
GG P.O.

1878
02:15:43,880 --> 02:15:44,880
Laughter

1879
02:15:44,880 --> 02:15:45,880
Whee!

1880
02:15:45,880 --> 02:15:56,600
Alright, that was Obsession from DanceManiaEX2 with your song, and I think Jamie just about

1881
02:15:56,600 --> 02:15:58,600
vomited during that.

1882
02:15:58,600 --> 02:16:01,280
I tried to ignore it, I blocked it out.

1883
02:16:01,280 --> 02:16:03,120
We were looking at my afterburner.

1884
02:16:03,120 --> 02:16:05,920
Personally, I kind of like it, it's not horrible.

1885
02:16:05,920 --> 02:16:07,480
My afterburner outshined that.

1886
02:16:07,480 --> 02:16:08,880
That was very cool.

1887
02:16:08,880 --> 02:16:11,080
Jamie, tell us about the mod you got for your game.

1888
02:16:11,080 --> 02:16:15,240
I have an afterburner installed on my Game Boy Advance that basically just, it's lights

1889
02:16:15,240 --> 02:16:21,560
that go around the screen and lights up. So you don't need a game shield or anything.

1890
02:16:21,560 --> 02:16:24,760
And it's brilliant. I can play in the dark.

1891
02:16:24,760 --> 02:16:28,480
Alright, it's time to announce the winner, ladies and gentlemen, of this week's cage

1892
02:16:28,480 --> 02:16:29,480
match.

1893
02:16:29,480 --> 02:16:32,880
Me! My foot wins.

1894
02:16:32,880 --> 02:16:37,360
Now, you guys, I have to admit, I think a lot of you, we got way less votes than we

1895
02:16:37,360 --> 02:16:38,360
usually do this week.

1896
02:16:38,360 --> 02:16:40,360
I think it's zero wins. I vote for zero.

1897
02:16:40,360 --> 02:16:46,880
I got way less votes than I usually do for cage match, but you know, it just it just happens sometimes and I begged

1898
02:16:46,880 --> 02:16:48,880
I pleaded but we got all the votes

1899
02:16:50,040 --> 02:16:56,640
And so yeah, I know this is actually gonna be a surprise to everyone but folks we added up the votes everybody and the winner

1900
02:16:57,360 --> 02:16:59,360
Is a little bit surprising?

1901
02:17:00,200 --> 02:17:02,200
the winner you guys is

1902
02:17:02,200 --> 02:17:09,200
is wild side with heaven as a place on earth

1903
02:17:23,360 --> 02:17:26,720
that's the winner I begged for votes

1904
02:17:26,720 --> 02:17:31,240
alright so it was a close one though

1905
02:17:31,240 --> 02:17:38,240
And, uh, funny enough, Loki, Loki, I thought it was gonna be the whole month you came in dead last to that vote.

1906
02:17:38,240 --> 02:17:39,240
Sorry.

1907
02:17:39,240 --> 02:17:41,240
There's only seven people that voted.

1908
02:17:41,240 --> 02:17:45,240
Where is everybody? That's what I wanna know.

1909
02:17:45,240 --> 02:17:47,240
Don't know. Don't know what to tell ya.

1910
02:17:47,240 --> 02:17:51,240
Alright, so, uh, but Loki, you know what that means?

1911
02:17:51,240 --> 02:17:53,240
That means you just gotta go make another remix.

1912
02:17:53,240 --> 02:17:54,240
Yep.

1913
02:17:54,240 --> 02:17:56,240
That's what I was gonna do anyways.

1914
02:17:56,240 --> 02:18:00,240
You should do a 511 speedmix.

1915
02:18:00,240 --> 02:18:01,240
No.

1916
02:18:01,240 --> 02:18:09,120
All right, there it is, winner of the cage match, Wild Side, Heaven is the place on Earth.

1917
02:18:09,120 --> 02:18:13,680
Okay, now we're going to do a segment on this show, you know it, you love it, we do it damn

1918
02:18:13,680 --> 02:18:18,520
near every week, but god damn it, it's just so popular, so much fun to do, we're doing

1919
02:18:18,520 --> 02:18:20,520
it again.

1920
02:18:20,520 --> 02:18:27,800
Listless, ladies and gentlemen, tonight's topic, Loki, tell us the topic for tonight.

1921
02:18:27,800 --> 02:18:29,800
It's the best 8-bit Nintendo game.

1922
02:18:57,800 --> 02:19:03,260
you have never played it, emulate it, find somebody who has it, and just sit in front of the TV for an hour and play it, and you'll love it.

1923
02:19:03,260 --> 02:19:06,580
and if you've ever played Samba De Amigo, it has the oppa oppa song.

1924
02:19:06,580 --> 02:19:08,580
I do do do do do do do do do.

1925
02:19:08,580 --> 02:19:10,580
yeah dude.

1926
02:19:10,580 --> 02:19:17,420
well, well, well no, but also, for anyone who's ever seen my quote on my banner on the EDR Freak and the one I used to have on Sacre Mani,

1927
02:19:17,420 --> 02:19:19,820
it's, welcome to the fantasy zone, get ready.

1928
02:19:19,820 --> 02:19:21,820
we all know what game that came from.

1929
02:19:21,820 --> 02:19:23,820
fill me in.

1930
02:19:23,820 --> 02:19:31,820
Um, Space Harrier, because Space Harrier was in the fantasy zone, as in from the old game.

1931
02:19:31,820 --> 02:19:34,820
Oh my gosh, I forgot about that because I haven't played that game in so long.

1932
02:19:34,820 --> 02:19:37,820
Why else do you think the whole game was pastel with a checkered floor?

1933
02:19:37,820 --> 02:19:39,820
Okay.

1934
02:19:39,820 --> 02:19:42,820
Alright, here we go. Who's going to start us off tonight?

1935
02:19:42,820 --> 02:19:43,820
You.

1936
02:19:43,820 --> 02:19:52,820
Me? Alright, I'll start. My pick for best 8-bit Nintendo game ever is a little weird, but you've got to represent, you've got to

1937
02:19:52,820 --> 02:19:55,820
You've got to know your roots. You have to know your roots.

1938
02:19:55,820 --> 02:20:00,820
My number three pick for best Nintendo game ever is Dance Aerobics.

1939
02:20:00,820 --> 02:20:02,820
Freak.

1940
02:20:02,820 --> 02:20:06,820
You know, when you said going back to your roots, I was thinking that you were going to start playing RuPaul.

1941
02:20:06,820 --> 02:20:07,820
No.

1942
02:20:07,820 --> 02:20:10,820
You better work. Covergirls, you dancing.

1943
02:20:10,820 --> 02:20:12,820
No. RuPaul did a song called Back to My Roots.

1944
02:20:12,820 --> 02:20:13,820
Oh, really?

1945
02:20:13,820 --> 02:20:14,820
About getting hairdressed.

1946
02:20:14,820 --> 02:20:17,820
Oh, no. I only know the supermodel song. Sorry.

1947
02:20:17,820 --> 02:20:22,820
Dance Robe is my number 3 pick, simply because DDR is a complete rip-off of Dance Robics.

1948
02:20:26,820 --> 02:20:33,820
Track and Build was just not a game a lot of people played, because they didn't want to spend the money on the stupid pad and all that crap.

1949
02:20:34,820 --> 02:20:36,820
I have one pick.

1950
02:20:38,820 --> 02:20:40,820
My number 3 pick...

1951
02:20:40,820 --> 02:20:44,820
Now keep in mind it only came out in Japan, but because it was on the Famicom, it counts.

1952
02:20:44,820 --> 02:20:48,820
KidDracula

1953
02:20:48,820 --> 02:20:52,820
KidDracula

1954
02:20:52,820 --> 02:20:56,820
KidDracula is Jamie's number 3 pick

1955
02:20:56,820 --> 02:21:00,820
Zero

1956
02:21:00,820 --> 02:21:04,820
Hogan's Alley

1957
02:21:04,820 --> 02:21:08,820
Hogan's Alley

1958
02:21:08,820 --> 02:21:12,820
Hogan's Alley

1959
02:21:12,820 --> 02:21:14,820
That is so cool though.

1960
02:21:14,820 --> 02:21:19,300
Hogan's Alley and already the chat room is going crazy saying all these games have to

1961
02:21:19,300 --> 02:21:23,840
be mentioned and I already know none of them are going to get mentioned because our picks

1962
02:21:23,840 --> 02:21:24,840
are off the wall.

1963
02:21:24,840 --> 02:21:25,840
I know these people.

1964
02:21:25,840 --> 02:21:27,340
We've got to go back to our roots here.

1965
02:21:27,340 --> 02:21:28,340
Uh oh.

1966
02:21:28,340 --> 02:21:32,820
Okay, we're going with the best all time fucking game ever, Contra.

1967
02:21:32,820 --> 02:21:33,820
Contra!

1968
02:21:33,820 --> 02:21:40,140
But no way, the Japanese version was better because the trees moved.

1969
02:21:40,140 --> 02:21:45,140
And it had an intro.

1970
02:21:45,140 --> 02:21:47,380
Alright, dance-robics, Kid Dracula.

1971
02:21:47,380 --> 02:21:50,580
It's like anyone pays attention to that when you're shooting random aliens that keep jumping

1972
02:21:50,580 --> 02:21:51,580
at you.

1973
02:21:51,580 --> 02:21:54,180
And tanks and robots and...

1974
02:21:54,180 --> 02:21:56,100
I noticed these things.

1975
02:21:56,100 --> 02:21:58,500
Alright, number two pick.

1976
02:21:58,500 --> 02:22:03,820
My number two pick for best 8-bit game ever, Mega Man 2.

1977
02:22:03,820 --> 02:22:04,820
I hate you.

1978
02:22:04,820 --> 02:22:05,820
That was my number two pick.

1979
02:22:05,820 --> 02:22:07,820
That means I have to come up with the next one.

1980
02:22:07,820 --> 02:22:08,820
Was it really?

1981
02:22:08,820 --> 02:22:09,820
Uh oh.

1982
02:22:09,820 --> 02:22:15,820
Mega Man 2 is my second favorite, but you can take a suggestion from the chatroom, there's plenty of suggestions if you want to see that.

1983
02:22:19,820 --> 02:22:25,820
Alright, then Mega Man 2, the reason why I say Mega Man 2 and not Mega Man 1, just because I think the series...

1984
02:22:25,820 --> 02:22:27,820
Mega Man 2 was the top of the series.

1985
02:22:27,820 --> 02:22:34,820
Mega Man 2 was when it really started to take off. That's really the one that everybody, you know, all the other Mega Mans were a rip-off of, was Mega Man 2.

1986
02:22:34,820 --> 02:22:35,820
Two words. Two words.

1987
02:22:35,820 --> 02:22:36,820
Big shades?

1988
02:22:36,820 --> 02:22:37,820
Metal blades.

1989
02:22:37,820 --> 02:22:48,260
I would shoot myself if I didn't mention it, since you took my number two favorite, Legend

1990
02:22:48,260 --> 02:22:49,260
of Zelda.

1991
02:22:49,260 --> 02:22:58,900
Because I hated Zelda II.

1992
02:22:58,900 --> 02:23:02,460
You know a lot of the chat room would agree with you with it.

1993
02:23:02,460 --> 02:23:03,900
I like Zelda II, I appreciate Zelda II.

1994
02:23:03,900 --> 02:23:10,000
Zelda II was more like playing an RPG, but The Legend of Zelda was just like, oh my god.

1995
02:23:10,000 --> 02:23:13,380
And I would actually have almost mentioned Metroid, except I said I kept Metroid, so

1996
02:23:13,380 --> 02:23:14,800
Zelda.

1997
02:23:14,800 --> 02:23:17,800
And you know, I like Zelda II a lot.

1998
02:23:17,800 --> 02:23:19,760
What's funny is that Nintendo sequels kind of did that.

1999
02:23:19,760 --> 02:23:24,120
You had Mario Bros. 2, it was completely different than Mario Bros. 1.

2000
02:23:24,120 --> 02:23:25,320
I know, I know it wasn't a Mario.

2001
02:23:25,320 --> 02:23:29,060
Zelda II, okay, frickin', his sword was like a little dagger.

2002
02:23:29,060 --> 02:23:30,060
It was pathetic.

2003
02:23:30,060 --> 02:23:31,060
Pathetic dagger.

2004
02:23:31,060 --> 02:23:36,060
I mean, I think he's like, I'm poking you with the dagger, poking you with the dagger.

2005
02:23:36,060 --> 02:23:41,060
Although I did like that in Super Smash Brothers, they gave him his Zelda 2 moves, which made

2006
02:23:41,060 --> 02:23:43,060
more sense for fighting him.

2007
02:23:43,060 --> 02:23:48,060
Dude, in Zelda 2, his sword looked like a penis.

2008
02:23:48,060 --> 02:23:52,060
The exact second you said that, Bob Lombardi said it was a blue penis, like at the exact

2009
02:23:52,060 --> 02:23:53,060
same moment.

2010
02:23:53,060 --> 02:23:54,060
That was scary.

2011
02:23:54,060 --> 02:23:55,060
You guys are on the same wavelength.

2012
02:23:55,060 --> 02:23:57,060
Because that's obvious, though.

2013
02:23:57,060 --> 02:24:01,060
It was a phallic thing, one of the perverted game counselors.

2014
02:24:01,060 --> 02:24:03,060
Alright Ryan, you're number two.

2015
02:24:03,060 --> 02:24:07,060
My number two, it wasn't really popular, but Arkanoid.

2016
02:24:07,060 --> 02:24:08,060
Arkanoid!

2017
02:24:08,060 --> 02:24:10,060
Arkanoid, alright.

2018
02:24:10,060 --> 02:24:12,060
It was the most, yeah, Breakout also.

2019
02:24:12,060 --> 02:24:18,060
It was the most redundant game in the world, and you got really pissed off when you couldn't pass the third level and had to start all over.

2020
02:24:18,060 --> 02:24:21,060
Dan was playing that on our Atari 2600, Breakout.

2021
02:24:21,060 --> 02:24:24,060
Yeah, but at least the Nintendo one was a little more colorful though.

2022
02:24:24,060 --> 02:24:27,060
I was playing that on Neopets the other day, except it's called Corbat's Lab.

2023
02:24:27,060 --> 02:24:29,060
That's what that is!

2024
02:24:29,060 --> 02:24:31,060
How did you play that game?

2025
02:24:31,060 --> 02:24:33,060
Okay.

2026
02:24:33,060 --> 02:24:35,060
Now...

2027
02:24:35,060 --> 02:24:38,060
I'm a master on Distracto Match now. Anyway, we'll talk Neopets later.

2028
02:24:38,060 --> 02:24:41,060
I want to talk about Waste of Time websites at the end of the show.

2029
02:24:41,060 --> 02:24:43,060
Because we have some new ones coming up this week.

2030
02:24:43,060 --> 02:24:45,060
Time to bring out the big guns.

2031
02:24:45,060 --> 02:24:47,060
Castlevania 2, Simon's Quest.

2032
02:24:47,060 --> 02:24:49,060
Excellent. Excellent.

2033
02:24:49,060 --> 02:24:51,060
The only Castlevania... No, not the only Castlevania matters,

2034
02:24:51,060 --> 02:24:53,060
because we have the whole Dracula X series.

2035
02:24:53,060 --> 02:24:58,060
Simon was the hero of all the Belmonts and the non-Belmonts.

2036
02:24:58,060 --> 02:25:03,060
This pissed me off is the fact that with the Captain N cartoon, they made Simon Belmont into this pretentious asshole.

2037
02:25:03,060 --> 02:25:06,060
Yeah, I know. That was stupid.

2038
02:25:06,060 --> 02:25:11,060
Again, Castlevania, another Nintendo game where the sequel was a complete departure from the original.

2039
02:25:11,060 --> 02:25:19,060
Don't let me forget to get you a ROM of Konami World for the Famicom because there's a Castlevania 2 level in it.

2040
02:25:19,060 --> 02:25:25,060
The Konami World Games are a winner, but they're too obscure for anyone to know anything about.

2041
02:25:25,060 --> 02:25:27,060
Okay, Rob.

2042
02:25:27,060 --> 02:25:34,060
Alright, moving on. Okay, now we got the number one choice. My number one choice for greatest 8-bit Nintendo game ever?

2043
02:25:34,060 --> 02:25:36,060
Blaster Master.

2044
02:25:36,060 --> 02:25:40,060
We all know the grenade trick, don't we?

2045
02:25:40,060 --> 02:25:46,060
Absolutely. The sequels to Blaster Master, they don't exist to me. They are ass.

2046
02:25:46,060 --> 02:25:51,060
Somebody needs to make a really good sequel to Blaster Master that plays just like the original.

2047
02:25:51,060 --> 02:25:54,060
That game was the shit. The end.

2048
02:25:54,060 --> 02:25:58,060
You know who should do it? Treasure.

2049
02:25:58,060 --> 02:26:00,060
And they should do it like the way they did Bunk IO.

2050
02:26:00,060 --> 02:26:02,060
I have no idea what that is.

2051
02:26:02,060 --> 02:26:03,060
You don't know what Treasure is?

2052
02:26:03,060 --> 02:26:04,060
I've never played it.

2053
02:26:04,060 --> 02:26:07,060
Treasure is the best video game manufacturing group ever.

2054
02:26:07,060 --> 02:26:09,060
They did Gunstar Heroes.

2055
02:26:09,060 --> 02:26:14,980
Okay, they did radiant silver gun. Oh, okay. Yeah. Okay. Oh, you should just said the people that do radiant silver gun

2056
02:26:14,980 --> 02:26:16,980
No, no treasure treasure

2057
02:26:17,460 --> 02:26:19,300
Yeah, whoosh. Oh, well, okay

2058
02:26:19,300 --> 02:26:25,020
But technically actually I just have to say is that my number one would really be the same thing that Jamie's putting for her

2059
02:26:25,020 --> 02:26:29,460
Number one, but I already knew she was gonna put it so I didn't have to so I said something else. All right

2060
02:26:30,260 --> 02:26:34,620
Guardian legend fuck. Yeah, the Guardian legends best game ever

2061
02:26:34,620 --> 02:26:41,620
her

2062
02:27:34,620 --> 02:27:38,900
things should kill the higher levels you get, so it has that RPG element in it too.

2063
02:27:38,900 --> 02:27:41,980
And by the way, you find little shops with these blue aliens, and it's Lolo and Lala

2064
02:27:41,980 --> 02:27:45,900
from Adventures of Lolo.

2065
02:27:45,900 --> 02:27:51,420
And then you find these little levels, and the way that the levels are set up, you have

2066
02:27:51,420 --> 02:27:56,660
your entry level, which is level 0, and then you have 110, 220, or like that.

2067
02:27:56,660 --> 02:27:57,660
It was 111, didn't it?

2068
02:27:57,660 --> 02:27:58,660
It wasn't 11, 12?

2069
02:27:58,660 --> 02:27:59,660
No, it was 111.

2070
02:27:59,660 --> 02:28:00,660
It was 111.

2071
02:28:00,660 --> 02:28:03,980
Because when you get to level 10, it's 1020.

2072
02:28:03,980 --> 02:28:07,500
Which were, by the way, the freakin' hardest levels in the universe.

2073
02:28:07,500 --> 02:28:13,380
I have beaten that game all of once.

2074
02:28:13,380 --> 02:28:14,380
Beautiful game.

2075
02:28:14,380 --> 02:28:18,620
I can beat, you know, the last level of the game, I can breeze my way through, cause once

2076
02:28:18,620 --> 02:28:22,320
you get the backfire weapon, you just like sit in the corner and shoot it with the backfire

2077
02:28:22,320 --> 02:28:23,320
weapon.

2078
02:28:23,320 --> 02:28:28,940
And by the way, your game counselor tip of the day, use TGL as your password to bypass

2079
02:28:28,940 --> 02:28:30,940
the Zelda-ish part of the game.

2080
02:28:30,940 --> 02:28:33,620
unbreakable password system

2081
02:28:33,620 --> 02:28:36,780
uh... interesting no one has been able to break this uh... password system

2082
02:28:36,780 --> 02:28:39,960
you know i can't figure out all the mega man was like you know no problem but

2083
02:28:39,960 --> 02:28:41,460
no one can break

2084
02:28:41,460 --> 02:28:43,080
the guardian legends password system

2085
02:28:43,080 --> 02:28:44,620
as you can see g l

2086
02:28:44,620 --> 02:28:48,200
you bypass all the adventure levels and you play like just like shooter

2087
02:28:48,200 --> 02:28:51,020
in between levels you get your special weapons and what you normally would have

2088
02:28:51,020 --> 02:28:54,100
gotten

2089
02:28:54,100 --> 02:28:57,160
enough about how are you out that boy we spent a lot of time on that one it's

2090
02:28:57,160 --> 02:28:59,240
obvious were a little bias here sorry

2091
02:28:59,240 --> 02:29:00,280
zero

2092
02:29:00,280 --> 02:29:02,680
What's your number one pick?

2093
02:29:02,680 --> 02:29:04,580
My number one pick was

2094
02:29:04,580 --> 02:29:06,440
Super Mario Brothers 3

2095
02:29:06,440 --> 02:29:07,340
because it was

2096
02:29:07,340 --> 02:29:11,220
I don't know, it was just like the best one and it almost seemed like it was kind of ahead of its time

2097
02:29:11,220 --> 02:29:15,180
when it came to getting all the different suits and stuff. And plus,

2098
02:29:15,180 --> 02:29:19,680
the first time anyone ever saw it was in the greatest movie ever.

2099
02:29:19,680 --> 02:29:21,200
And the wizard...

2100
02:29:21,200 --> 02:29:24,820
The wizard is the coolest movie in history. If you haven't seen it,

2101
02:29:24,820 --> 02:29:27,000
go buy it.

2102
02:29:27,000 --> 02:29:29,000
The power glove. It's so bad.

2103
02:29:29,000 --> 02:29:31,000
Go rent it.

2104
02:29:31,000 --> 02:29:33,000
Get your power glove off her.

2105
02:29:33,000 --> 02:29:35,000
Yeah, what was the point?

2106
02:29:35,000 --> 02:29:37,000
I don't even think it was that useful.

2107
02:29:37,000 --> 02:29:39,000
I think you used it for two things and that was it.

2108
02:29:39,000 --> 02:29:41,000
I want the left hand and the right hand one.

2109
02:29:41,000 --> 02:29:43,000
I want the left hand and the right hand one.

2110
02:29:43,000 --> 02:29:47,000
So I could try to figure out how to punch out to it.

2111
02:29:47,000 --> 02:29:49,000
That would be so cool.

2112
02:29:49,000 --> 02:29:51,000
Remember the U-Force?

2113
02:29:51,000 --> 02:29:53,000
Yeah.

2114
02:29:53,000 --> 02:30:16,000
The power glove is so unbelievably rare that if you find one you can easily sell it on eBay for $100.

2115
02:30:23,000 --> 02:30:29,900
just the right for like 500 bucks you can't find him anywhere you should you

2116
02:30:29,900 --> 02:30:39,200
should check okay anyway all right yeah there's like tons of choices tons of

2117
02:30:39,200 --> 02:30:47,120
choices get your paraglobe offer well you know it's a kind of enough he

2118
02:30:47,120 --> 02:30:52,940
You touched my breast!

2119
02:30:52,940 --> 02:30:55,220
That was great.

2120
02:30:55,220 --> 02:30:57,920
Do touch your breast now.

2121
02:30:57,920 --> 02:31:02,560
One of my favorite games on the Nintendo had to have been,

2122
02:31:02,560 --> 02:31:04,760
I don't know, I go back and play it now and it's just like,

2123
02:31:04,760 --> 02:31:07,000
okay, whatever.

2124
02:31:07,000 --> 02:31:10,560
Bionic Commando.

2125
02:31:10,560 --> 02:31:13,200
Do you ever read Old Schooled?

2126
02:31:13,200 --> 02:31:17,080
The guy from Bionic Commando hangs out in the bar with all the other Nintendo characters,

2127
02:31:17,080 --> 02:31:20,280
He's like their hero because his bionic arm can reach out and grab beer from across the

2128
02:31:20,280 --> 02:31:27,280
hall.

2129
02:31:27,280 --> 02:31:31,080
That game was cool because you didn't have an arm, you had this giant claw thing that

2130
02:31:31,080 --> 02:31:36,300
grabbed on stuff and you couldn't jump because I guess the arm weighed too much and like

2131
02:31:36,300 --> 02:31:40,800
there's these guys that looked all the same but they were different shades of color and

2132
02:31:40,800 --> 02:31:45,360
they were put there different people and stuff happened and if you got caught by the people

2133
02:31:45,360 --> 02:32:04,360
The fact also you could choose your path too, and like you could say I want to go this way to like B or K and then bounce all around is pretty fun.

2134
02:32:04,360 --> 02:32:07,360
You said BK, and I started thinking of British Knights.

2135
02:32:07,360 --> 02:32:09,360
I started thinking of Burger King.

2136
02:32:09,360 --> 02:32:11,360
Hold on.

2137
02:32:11,360 --> 02:32:13,360
I gotta, I'm sorry, you know,

2138
02:32:13,360 --> 02:32:15,360
I like Bionic Commando,

2139
02:32:15,360 --> 02:32:17,360
but there's just something that just got a flash in my mind.

2140
02:32:17,360 --> 02:32:20,360
One of the best games ever,

2141
02:32:20,360 --> 02:32:22,360
and I need to change mine. I'm sorry.

2142
02:32:22,360 --> 02:32:24,360
You wanna change that one, or you wanna change one of your other ones?

2143
02:32:24,360 --> 02:32:26,360
You wanna change Contra, Castlevania 2?

2144
02:32:26,360 --> 02:32:28,360
Change Contra.

2145
02:32:28,360 --> 02:32:30,360
Oh, okay.

2146
02:32:32,360 --> 02:32:34,360
Alright, what are we putting on instead of Contra then?

2147
02:32:34,360 --> 02:32:40,360
You know, this might be a bad decision, but Marble Madness. Marble Madness!

2148
02:32:40,360 --> 02:32:47,360
They made the best points when they died. And the absence. And the Marvel video.

2149
02:32:47,360 --> 02:32:52,360
Best game ever, and I wish they'd make it on a new system, but they haven't yet.

2150
02:32:52,360 --> 02:32:54,360
It's on the Atari collection.

2151
02:32:54,360 --> 02:32:59,360
It's on the Atari collection for the, um, or no, the Midway collection for PlayStation,

2152
02:32:59,360 --> 02:33:02,360
and you can actually get the PlayStation track while we got one.

2153
02:33:02,360 --> 02:33:06,740
believe he just took off contour to put in marble madness all right let's read

2154
02:33:06,740 --> 02:33:12,620
the list here we go the list so far dance aerobics kid Dracula Hogan's Alley

2155
02:33:12,620 --> 02:33:15,220
marble madness Mega Man 2 the Legend of Zelda

2156
02:33:15,220 --> 02:33:19,520
Arknoid Castlevania 2 Simon's Quest blaster master the Guardian legends

2157
02:33:19,520 --> 02:33:23,540
Super Mario Brothers 3 and bionic commando now let's go through those

2158
02:33:23,540 --> 02:33:27,340
glaring omissions according to our chat room that we left off of the list

2159
02:33:27,340 --> 02:33:28,740
i think i think that's right

2160
02:33:28,740 --> 02:33:33,660
metroid had the most obvious this year didn't put the adobe said no here

2161
02:33:33,660 --> 02:33:35,780
uh... final fantasy

2162
02:33:35,780 --> 02:33:37,980
adventure island

2163
02:33:37,980 --> 02:33:42,020
robo-cop

2164
02:33:42,020 --> 02:33:43,920
gyro mike come on

2165
02:33:43,920 --> 02:33:47,100
but you guys i am you can't even squashed a professor to the point

2166
02:33:47,100 --> 02:33:47,900
uh...

2167
02:33:47,900 --> 02:33:50,340
dragon warrior

2168
02:33:50,340 --> 02:33:52,280
check where it is because i had a slime

2169
02:33:52,280 --> 02:33:54,060
bubble bobble

2170
02:33:54,060 --> 02:33:59,060
Bubble Bobble is a kick-ass game, however, the NES translation just was not the same as the arcade.

2171
02:33:59,060 --> 02:34:04,060
If we were talking about, like, best 80s arcade game, maybe, I'd put Bubble Bobble on there, but not for best Nintendo game.

2172
02:34:04,060 --> 02:34:05,060
Right. Kickle Cubicle.

2173
02:34:05,060 --> 02:34:07,060
Kickle Cubicle was pretty cool.

2174
02:34:07,060 --> 02:34:09,060
And, and, and, Anisysm.

2175
02:34:09,060 --> 02:34:15,060
Uh, Kid Icarus, Ice Climber, Battletoads, River City Ransom, Double Dragon.

2176
02:34:15,060 --> 02:34:20,060
Okay, I didn't say River City Ransom because I have the PC Engine version, which totally kicks its ass.

2177
02:34:21,060 --> 02:34:22,060
No, it's Nintendo.

2178
02:34:22,060 --> 02:34:31,180
Nintendo, Star Tropics, yes, um, Mario Tennis, I don't think, no Tennis on 8-bit, don't mention

2179
02:34:31,180 --> 02:34:34,940
any stupid Virtual Boy games because they all gave me a headache, I'm just kind of scrambling

2180
02:34:34,940 --> 02:34:41,340
to list, oh and then last, oh we have Adventures of Lolo, I have, hey I mentioned it, I have

2181
02:34:41,340 --> 02:34:49,580
bad memory, no I'm just kidding, Clu Clu Land, I have psychological damage every time, no

2182
02:34:49,580 --> 02:34:53,580
I can play Clu Clu Land on Animal Crossing, and I can play Balloon Fight on Animal Crossing.

2183
02:35:19,580 --> 02:35:25,960
upload my DWI to the Mike Tyson's punch out like remix I was like perfect DWI to

2184
02:35:25,960 --> 02:35:33,020
it it took me like 30 minutes but it was really good and it has the um and it has

2185
02:35:33,020 --> 02:35:40,680
the instruction manual as the background that's great all right okay so now we

2186
02:35:40,680 --> 02:35:44,760
got to vote stuff off this is gonna be very difficult tonight you guys would be

2187
02:35:44,760 --> 02:35:47,960
very difficult. Uh, I guess I have to start, huh?

2188
02:35:47,960 --> 02:35:53,400
Uh, well, you're all gonna hate me, I'm taking off Marble Madness.

2189
02:35:53,400 --> 02:35:56,880
The reason why, no, I have good justification,

2190
02:35:56,880 --> 02:36:01,280
because Marble Madness was way too short. It was only six levels. The thrill,

2191
02:36:01,280 --> 02:36:04,920
the thrill was gone in a day. I'm sorry, I just can't,

2192
02:36:04,920 --> 02:36:09,000
nah, I can't let it be there. Marble Madness is really only worthy to play if you have the trackball.

2193
02:36:09,000 --> 02:36:13,800
Which is why I was very lucky to hit Toys R Us when they were clearing out their trackballs

2194
02:36:13,800 --> 02:36:34,400
This sucks, because the two obvious ones are gone now.

2195
02:36:34,400 --> 02:36:37,840
I will take off my own, Hogan's Alley.

2196
02:36:37,840 --> 02:36:42,560
It was fun, but it's not one of the very best games ever.

2197
02:36:42,560 --> 02:36:46,800
Amazingly enough, first time in the history of this show, if I'm not mistaken, somebody

2198
02:36:46,800 --> 02:36:48,120
took their own item off the list.

2199
02:36:48,120 --> 02:36:49,120
No?

2200
02:36:49,120 --> 02:36:50,120
No?

2201
02:36:50,120 --> 02:36:51,120
We did this list last week.

2202
02:36:51,120 --> 02:36:52,640
Oh, did you all do that or something?

2203
02:36:52,640 --> 02:36:56,120
I forgot what we did it about, but everybody but me took off.

2204
02:36:56,120 --> 02:36:57,120
Best liquor.

2205
02:36:57,120 --> 02:36:59,000
Oh God, you guys!

2206
02:36:59,000 --> 02:37:01,860
Everybody but me took off one of their own.

2207
02:37:01,860 --> 02:37:02,860
I stand corrected.

2208
02:37:02,860 --> 02:37:06,880
One thing I can't believe we all forgot was Excitebike.

2209
02:37:06,880 --> 02:37:10,600
Even though it was short, it was still a classic though.

2210
02:37:10,600 --> 02:37:14,240
was awesome, but it badly needed an update. Like, if they did it on... Well, I guess some

2211
02:37:14,240 --> 02:37:18,160
say that Uniracers is supposed to be a sequel to Excitebike. I don't buy that.

2212
02:37:18,160 --> 02:37:22,520
And the 64 version was absolutely horrible. I never played that. Oh, God.

2213
02:37:22,520 --> 02:37:27,800
It was stupid. Oh, well. Actually, no, there was one on Gameboy,

2214
02:37:27,800 --> 02:37:32,040
I think it was Motocross Maniac or something, that played kind of similar, but it was ass.

2215
02:37:32,040 --> 02:37:35,200
All right, Loki, last one coming off, what is it?

2216
02:37:35,200 --> 02:37:42,200
Um, just Arkanoid, because I don't like that game.

2217
02:37:42,200 --> 02:37:45,200
Alright, Arkanoid comes off the list.

2218
02:37:45,200 --> 02:37:50,200
Hey, it's either there or Kid Dracula, because Kid Dracula just reminds me of that stupid

2219
02:37:50,200 --> 02:37:51,200
Little Vampire movie.

2220
02:37:51,200 --> 02:37:55,200
And God, I hate that Little Vampire movie.

2221
02:37:55,200 --> 02:38:00,200
I'm going to make him play now.

2222
02:38:00,200 --> 02:38:02,200
Jamie's going to make him play now.

2223
02:38:02,200 --> 02:38:05,200
Alright, here we go.

2224
02:38:05,200 --> 02:38:07,200
Uh, this is the list.

2225
02:38:07,200 --> 02:38:09,200
Send in your votes right now.

2226
02:38:09,200 --> 02:38:16,200
Kid Dracula, Mega Man 2, The Legend of Zelda, Castlevania 2, Simon's Quest, Blaster Master.

2227
02:38:16,200 --> 02:38:17,200
Should I read those?

2228
02:38:17,200 --> 02:38:18,200
Oh, okay. Sorry.

2229
02:38:18,200 --> 02:38:19,200
Should I read those?

2230
02:38:19,200 --> 02:38:21,200
You were too busy getting mad at Loki.

2231
02:38:21,200 --> 02:38:22,200
Alright, then start from the top.

2232
02:38:22,200 --> 02:38:24,920
I'm going to post this in the chatroom.

2233
02:38:24,920 --> 02:38:25,920
All right, star for the top.

2234
02:38:25,920 --> 02:38:27,320

02:38:27,320 --> 02:38:31,480

02:38:35,400 --> 02:38:38,520
Brothers 3, and Bionic Commando.

2238
02:38:38,520 --> 02:38:44,480
All right, send in your votes right freaking now.

2239
02:38:44,480 --> 02:38:46,040
In the meantime, we're going to take a quick break.

2240
02:38:46,040 --> 02:38:46,680
We'll be back.

2241
02:38:46,680 --> 02:38:51,360
We got some brief announcements and reminders, a message,

2242
02:38:51,360 --> 02:38:55,800
and uh... other things

2243
02:38:55,800 --> 02:39:00,360
more people need to vote them voted on the uh... cage match cuz

okay we'll be right back after we hear this eight style song that makes me wet

2248
02:43:07,100 --> 02:43:13,220
One, two, three, four!

2249
02:44:07,100 --> 02:44:36,620
Let's listen in on an Orange Lounge Radio staff meeting.

2250
02:44:36,620 --> 02:44:41,620
Stream Bamani Radio. That's us. Orange Lounge Radio.

2251
02:44:41,620 --> 02:44:46,620
We're back. Wrapping up episode number 34 here in this final segment.

2252
02:44:46,620 --> 02:44:53,620
I heard a funny joke. Irene and Brad told me a funny joke today, so I thought we'd have joke time on Orange Lounge Radio.

2253
02:44:53,620 --> 02:44:58,620
So here we go. Knock, knock. Interrupting cow. Moo!

2254
02:44:58,620 --> 02:45:03,620
That's like totally from South Park.

2255
02:45:03,620 --> 02:45:04,620
Is it really?

2256
02:45:04,620 --> 02:45:05,620
Yeah, it's from...

2257
02:45:05,620 --> 02:45:07,620
The other retarded kid, I forget his name.

2258
02:45:07,620 --> 02:45:09,620
I feel like the muffin joke.

2259
02:45:09,620 --> 02:45:10,620
Damn it!

2260
02:45:10,620 --> 02:45:13,620
I didn't know that was from South Park because I stopped watching South Park because I didn't

2261
02:45:13,620 --> 02:45:14,620
even know they were making new ones anymore.

2262
02:45:14,620 --> 02:45:15,620
I feel like the muffin joke.

2263
02:45:15,620 --> 02:45:16,620
Damn.

2264
02:45:16,620 --> 02:45:17,620
I feel like I...

2265
02:45:17,620 --> 02:45:18,620
Oh, you want me to tell the muffin joke?

2266
02:45:18,620 --> 02:45:19,620
I want to tell it.

2267
02:45:19,620 --> 02:45:20,620
Alright.

2268
02:45:20,620 --> 02:45:21,620
You remember the muffin joke?

2269
02:45:21,620 --> 02:45:22,620
Have you heard the muffin joke?

2270
02:45:22,620 --> 02:45:23,620
Okay.

2271
02:45:23,620 --> 02:45:24,620
Okay.

2272
02:45:24,620 --> 02:45:25,620
I'll give Ryan the other mic.

2273
02:45:25,620 --> 02:45:26,620
Alright.

2274
02:45:26,620 --> 02:45:27,620
Two muffins are baking in the oven.

2275
02:45:27,620 --> 02:45:33,420
Baking in the oven and one of the other muffins go. Oh my god. We're cooking we're burning. You know because I should have talking muffin

2276
02:45:38,300 --> 02:45:40,300
Yeah

2277
02:45:41,620 --> 02:45:43,420
All right, I

2278
02:45:43,420 --> 02:45:46,480
Feel stupid now that I know that joke came in South Park

2279
02:45:46,480 --> 02:45:51,960
She's not a stupid joke, but it was kind of just funny the way they said does anybody seen catch me if you can

2280
02:45:52,260 --> 02:45:56,140
No, there's a part where Tom Hanks is sitting there with a bunch of other FBI agents

2281
02:45:56,140 --> 02:45:57,140
Why don't you tell a joke?

2282
02:45:57,140 --> 02:45:58,140
And he's all, okay.

2283
02:45:58,140 --> 02:45:59,140
He's all, knock knock.

2284
02:45:59,140 --> 02:46:00,140
Oh.

2285
02:46:00,140 --> 02:46:01,140
Who's there?

2286
02:46:01,140 --> 02:46:02,140
And he goes, go fuck yourself.

2287
02:46:02,140 --> 02:46:05,140
And that was the end of the joke.

2288
02:46:05,140 --> 02:46:06,140
Right.

2289
02:46:06,140 --> 02:46:07,140
You know what was a joke?

2290
02:46:07,140 --> 02:46:10,860
Those pictures of the person playing DDR just to Sakura.

2291
02:46:10,860 --> 02:46:12,460
That was, that was cute.

2292
02:46:12,460 --> 02:46:13,460
That was cute.

2293
02:46:13,460 --> 02:46:14,460
It was a cute routine.

2294
02:46:14,460 --> 02:46:15,460
Yeah.

2295
02:46:15,460 --> 02:46:16,460
That was a good costume.

2296
02:46:16,460 --> 02:46:17,460
Yeah, it was cool.

2297
02:46:17,460 --> 02:46:18,460
It wasn't a joke.

2298
02:46:18,460 --> 02:46:19,460
It was serious time, man.

2299
02:46:19,460 --> 02:46:20,460
Let's get our winners.

2300
02:46:20,460 --> 02:46:21,460
Oh!

2301
02:46:21,460 --> 02:46:24,780
Also, I have to say, the, uh, one thing I didn't, I forgot to say about Cyberbeat is

2302
02:46:24,780 --> 02:46:27,860
is that my badge said Judge on it, except I wasn't judging freestyle. It's actually

2303
02:46:27,860 --> 02:46:31,620
the Fashion Judge. And you're gonna hear, you'll hear the results of that on the Cyberbeat

2304
02:46:31,620 --> 02:46:32,620
Special.

2305
02:46:32,620 --> 02:46:33,620
Okay.

2306
02:46:33,620 --> 02:46:36,500
So, that airs once again, in case you're just joining us, the Cyberbeat Special will air

2307
02:46:36,500 --> 02:46:40,720
Friday at 7pm Pacific Time and Saturday at 4.

2308
02:46:40,720 --> 02:46:45,220
Okay. Oh yes, the winner's decayed match.

2309
02:46:45,220 --> 02:46:46,940
We've got, we've got Loki playing Kid Dracula now.

2310
02:46:46,940 --> 02:46:48,660
Oh, Loki's hooked on Kid Dracula now? Okay.

2311
02:46:48,660 --> 02:46:49,660
I'm not hooked on it.

2312
02:46:49,660 --> 02:46:50,660
I'm not hooked on it.

2313
02:46:50,660 --> 02:46:51,660
Alright, here we go.

2314
02:46:51,660 --> 02:46:52,660
Tryin' it out.

2315
02:46:52,660 --> 02:47:02,100
Number 3, by your vote, listless, here it is, number 3 best 8-bit game ever, drum roll,

2316
02:47:02,100 --> 02:47:18,120
is Super Mario Bros. 3, or as the guy in the wizard said, Super Mario Bros. 3. Okay. Number

2317
02:47:18,120 --> 02:47:24,040
Number two best Nintendo game ever.

2318
02:47:24,040 --> 02:47:29,520
The Legend of Zelda.

2319
02:47:29,520 --> 02:47:35,120
And the best Nintendo game ever as voted by you guys.

2320
02:47:35,120 --> 02:47:36,120
Mega Man 2.

2321
02:47:36,120 --> 02:47:37,380
It's the winner.

2322
02:47:37,380 --> 02:47:46,600
Mega Man 2 is the best Nintendo game ever according to the chat room.

2323
02:47:46,600 --> 02:47:50,240
Guardian Legend didn't get a single vote. How the hell did that happen?

2324
02:47:50,240 --> 02:47:56,180
It's mostly because people play all the mainstream games. Like Blaster Masters, mainstream as it was, it wasn't.

2325
02:47:56,180 --> 02:47:59,020
I was surprised because I didn't think anybody in here was going to end up

2326
02:47:59,020 --> 02:48:03,180
putting a mainstream. When I was listening to the number three choices, I'm like, nobody's going to put a mainstream game on here

2327
02:48:03,180 --> 02:48:06,220
and then all of a sudden the number ones were all mainstream. But hey, it happens.

2328
02:48:06,220 --> 02:48:08,320
I was going to put a bunch of other ones.

2329
02:48:08,320 --> 02:48:13,020
But no one really played Arkanoid or Hogan's Alley. I played Arkanoid, it just was an arcade game.

2330
02:48:13,020 --> 02:48:16,700
and i played all the images need to go play guardian legend

2331
02:48:16,700 --> 02:48:18,700
all about that too

2332
02:48:18,700 --> 02:48:20,340
the question

2333
02:48:20,340 --> 02:48:23,700
what was the one which have like a fat lady is the boss

2334
02:48:23,700 --> 02:48:30,700
without rampaged her not really ready to get in and i think that's about it

2335
02:48:32,460 --> 02:48:35,340
a car you were used to always pushed out when we played it

2336
02:48:35,340 --> 02:48:37,540
recently to get dust on the

2337
02:48:37,540 --> 02:48:39,940
the game just to see how badly it's rich out

2338
02:48:39,940 --> 02:48:41,180
it was awesome

2339
02:48:41,180 --> 02:48:48,180
No, it was all about pro wrestling. The one where you had like one kick in one punch.

2340
02:48:50,100 --> 02:48:53,980
We had another joke in the chat room. This is pretty funny. John Fields submitted this

2341
02:48:53,980 --> 02:48:58,060
joke. Okay, two guys are hunting in the woods. One gets hurt and the other goes 911. The

2342
02:48:58,060 --> 02:49:02,900
operator says, okay, well let's make sure he's hurt. There's silence then a gunshot.

2343
02:49:02,900 --> 02:49:04,300
Guy comes back on and says, okay, what now?

2344
02:49:04,300 --> 02:49:08,300
Have you ever heard the story of the Fupu Bird?

2345
02:49:08,300 --> 02:49:12,300
Have you heard the story of the Fupu Bird?

2346
02:49:12,300 --> 02:49:16,300
No.

2347
02:49:16,300 --> 02:49:20,300
Three great explorers have hunted this legendary bird called the Fupu Bird.

2348
02:49:20,300 --> 02:49:24,300
The legend is that this bird is making people disappear, but no one knows how.

2349
02:49:24,300 --> 02:49:28,300
Have you ever heard the story of the Fupu Bird?

2350
02:49:28,300 --> 02:49:32,300
No.

2351
02:49:32,300 --> 02:49:37,220
people disappear but no one knows how. So they go into the deep deep deep deep jungle

2352
02:49:37,220 --> 02:49:40,500
and two of them are together and one of them is by himself because this one by himself

2353
02:49:40,500 --> 02:49:44,300
thinks that he's just shit. Well anyway, he's walking along and he hears

2354
02:49:44,300 --> 02:49:50,860
AHH! There's a big wad of bird shit on his head. He does a little crap. He wipes it off

2355
02:49:50,860 --> 02:49:57,420
and he disappears. Ooh, scary. So the other two are together and sure enough they hear

2356
02:49:57,420 --> 02:50:02,420
And one of them gets shit on his head.

2357
02:50:02,420 --> 02:50:05,420
So he wipes it off and he disappears and his friend goes,

2358
02:50:05,420 --> 02:50:06,420
Oh my God! That's how it happens!

2359
02:50:06,420 --> 02:50:08,420
So he runs, runs, runs, runs, runs, runs, runs, runs, runs, runs.

2360
02:50:08,420 --> 02:50:10,420
But right before he sees him, of course,

2361
02:50:10,420 --> 02:50:15,420
And he gets crap on his head.

2362
02:50:15,420 --> 02:50:18,420
So he's smart, though. He's not wiping it off.

2363
02:50:18,420 --> 02:50:20,420
So he goes home with a big pile of poo on his head.

2364
02:50:20,420 --> 02:50:23,420
You know, he gets the best place to sit on the bus and everything.

2365
02:50:23,420 --> 02:50:25,420
He's, you know, in bed with his wife,

2366
02:50:25,420 --> 02:50:28,260
And the wife goes, you need to wipe that crap off your head.

2367
02:50:28,260 --> 02:50:29,860
He's like, no, but if I do, I'll disappear

2368
02:50:29,860 --> 02:50:30,980
and you'll never see me again.

2369
02:50:30,980 --> 02:50:32,900
Oh, well, I love you and we'll leave the crap on your head.

2370
02:50:32,900 --> 02:50:33,940
I can live with that.

2371
02:50:33,940 --> 02:50:36,980
But the stench gets so bad that later on in the night,

2372
02:50:36,980 --> 02:50:37,900
she's like, I can't stand this.

2373
02:50:37,900 --> 02:50:40,460
She wipes off his head and he disappears.

2374
02:50:40,460 --> 02:50:41,940
So you know what the moral of the story is?

2375
02:50:41,940 --> 02:50:42,580
What?

2376
02:50:42,580 --> 02:50:46,220
It's efficient, swear it.

2377
02:50:46,220 --> 02:50:50,540
Oh my god, that was the most awful thing ever.

2378
02:50:50,540 --> 02:50:54,300
My uncle told me this joke when I was 12.

2379
02:50:54,300 --> 02:50:56,300
Thank you for wasting everybody's time.

2380
02:50:56,300 --> 02:50:57,300
Okay.

2381
02:50:57,300 --> 02:50:59,780
Oh, that was the best joke and you know it.

2382
02:50:59,780 --> 02:51:02,460
No, the muffin joke's the best joke.

2383
02:51:02,460 --> 02:51:07,180
A new chatter in the chat room, Bizarro17, starts off a joke, says, so I said to the

2384
02:51:07,180 --> 02:51:08,180
prickly cactus...

2385
02:51:08,180 --> 02:51:10,060
And that was it.

2386
02:51:10,060 --> 02:51:11,060
There's no prickly...

2387
02:51:11,060 --> 02:51:12,060
Okay.

2388
02:51:12,060 --> 02:51:13,060
All right.

2389
02:51:13,060 --> 02:51:16,660
We only got a few minutes left in the show.

2390
02:51:16,660 --> 02:51:20,020
One thing I definitely want to say, a little special message out there.

We'll miss you.

2410
02:52:17,180 --> 02:52:18,180
Aren't you supposed to be announcing something?

2411
02:52:18,180 --> 02:52:19,180
What?

2412
02:52:19,180 --> 02:52:20,180
I don't know.

2413
02:52:20,180 --> 02:52:22,180
No, that was pretty much the announcement.

2414
02:52:22,180 --> 02:52:26,180
I didn't tell them to get all those, you know, freaky Americans, you know, the list of all those weirdos.

2415
02:52:26,180 --> 02:52:26,680
Yep.

2416
02:52:26,680 --> 02:52:29,680
I don't know, Zach Balmonte seems to be announcing something on the show.

2417
02:52:29,680 --> 02:52:32,680
Oh yeah, the Zach Balmonte thing. You were supposed to announce that on the show, too.

2418
02:52:32,680 --> 02:52:34,680
Well, let me just wrap up the angel thing.

2419
02:52:34,680 --> 02:52:36,180
What, the winner?

2420
02:52:36,180 --> 02:52:38,180
Yeah.

2421
02:52:38,180 --> 02:52:39,680
Oops.

2422
02:52:39,680 --> 02:52:42,680
What, you didn't tabulate the votes in time or something?

2423
02:52:42,680 --> 02:52:44,180
Actually, I did.

2424
02:52:44,180 --> 02:52:46,680
The winner.

2425
02:52:46,680 --> 02:52:48,680
Everyone likes JB's.

2426
02:52:48,680 --> 02:52:51,680
Should JB get it the hell finished so we can put it up?

2427
02:53:18,680 --> 02:53:24,380
No, because I guess I missed the joke.

2428
02:53:24,380 --> 02:53:31,300
Oh because it was all in the chat room, no wonder I missed it.

2429
02:53:31,300 --> 02:53:35,040
Okay, here, this is the real joke.

2430
02:53:35,040 --> 02:53:36,740
The set of the Brickling Cactus.

2431
02:53:36,740 --> 02:53:39,380
Okay, God, Jesus, and Saint Peter are golfing.

2432
02:53:39,380 --> 02:53:42,720
Saint Peter steps up to the tee, he takes a big swing, he hits the ball, it goes up

2433
02:53:42,720 --> 02:53:45,560
in the air, it lands ten feet from the cup.

2434
02:53:45,560 --> 02:53:49,540
Jesus steps up, he takes a huge swing, the ball goes flying, it lands two feet from the

2435
02:53:49,540 --> 02:53:50,540
cup.

2436
02:53:50,540 --> 02:53:54,820
God steps up, he takes the biggest swing you could ever see, the ball piddles off the tee.

2437
02:53:54,820 --> 02:53:59,060
All of a sudden, a weasel comes out and picks the ball up, runs off, an eagle comes by,

2438
02:53:59,060 --> 02:54:03,540
picks the weasel up and flies away, a hurricane comes by, blows the eagle back, and the eagle

2439
02:54:03,540 --> 02:54:07,120
drops the weasel.

2440
02:54:07,120 --> 02:54:08,620
And hold on, cause this little bit's here.

2441
02:54:08,620 --> 02:54:12,300
Oh yeah, the weasel drops the ball, the ball rolls into the cup, Jesus looks at God and

2442
02:54:12,300 --> 02:54:17,300
says, are you going to play golf or are you just going to fuck around?

2443
02:54:17,300 --> 02:54:28,300
You're going to hell for that. That's pretty funny. Yeah, well, we're all going to hell.

2444
02:54:28,300 --> 02:54:33,300
If you listen to this show, you're probably going to hell. The guy who made that t-shirt

2445
02:54:33,300 --> 02:54:40,940
from hell.com is going to hell. How about a sim update for the week, Loki? Anything

2446
02:54:40,940 --> 02:54:47,940
you want to say about the sim world, give me a cracker.

2447
02:55:10,940 --> 02:55:14,640
and uh...

2448
02:55:14,640 --> 02:55:15,700
uh...

2449
02:55:15,700 --> 02:55:19,420
the monies and i have stopped the money style just got

2450
02:55:19,420 --> 02:55:23,020
they're uploading their uh... media section against its wish to a dedicated

2451
02:55:23,020 --> 02:55:24,060
server

2452
02:55:24,060 --> 02:55:26,400
thanks to everyone's donations uh...

2453
02:55:26,400 --> 02:55:29,140
so they're going to be a pretty soon with uh...

2454
02:55:29,140 --> 02:55:33,300
all the like media and stuff in all of the itself videos and whatnot

2455
02:55:33,300 --> 02:55:37,100
uh... so they're gonna be coming up here you can see what some weird thing with

2456
02:55:37,100 --> 02:55:40,940
no you have to be like some registered member and what not to download shit

2457
02:55:40,940 --> 02:55:44,620
You can't even download it anyway. Not that that matters anyways when my site comes up

2458
02:55:44,620 --> 02:55:45,980
because I'm just going to have everything and say

2459
02:55:45,980 --> 02:55:49,340
whatever I don't require anything just download the hell

2460
02:55:49,340 --> 02:55:53,100
yeah but yeah my site yeah it's funny

2461
02:55:53,100 --> 02:55:56,300
yeah I'm working on it

2462
02:55:56,300 --> 02:56:00,780
really am it there's a lot of shit I gotta update in order to get this site up

2463
02:56:00,780 --> 02:56:03,900
mainly I'm working on the sim files getting them all zipped up putting

2464
02:56:03,900 --> 02:56:08,600
the appropriate CD tags with them, but a lot of the sim files that are incomplete need

2465
02:56:08,600 --> 02:56:14,380
to be fixed, need to make new backgrounds for them, just fix them up, and so that's

2466
02:56:14,380 --> 02:56:19,580
what's taking the longest time right now. Right now I've got everything done, I've second

2467
02:56:19,580 --> 02:56:23,500
style, third style, and I'm almost done with fourth style. Problem is it's going to get

2468
02:56:23,500 --> 02:56:29,340
even slower now because the higher up I go the more sim files I have. So once those are

2469
02:56:29,340 --> 02:56:34,740
ever done, I promise I'll be a probably be like a good 600 files up it's the first, the

2470
02:56:34,740 --> 02:56:38,660
first update. So, it'll be worth it, but it's just gonna take awhile before that comes up.

2471
02:56:38,660 --> 02:56:44,600
And just so you guys know listening, there will be every week there will be a nice hidden

2472
02:56:44,600 --> 02:56:49,740
page for exclusive to the listeners with Sim Files stuff that will not be on the site and

2473
02:56:49,740 --> 02:56:54,880
I'll maybe be able to give it a month before I update those on to the actual site, off

2474
02:56:54,880 --> 02:56:58,560
the hidden pages, but those will be exclusive for the listeners of the show. You'll have

2475
02:56:58,560 --> 02:57:02,880
exclusive DWIs before everyone else. So, enjoy.

2476
02:57:02,880 --> 02:57:10,200
There's actually a pretty decent StepMania theme that was posted on stepmania.com. It's

2477
02:57:10,200 --> 02:57:17,580
called Forever Blue 2.0 or something. I would say it's a very different take on the themes

2478
02:57:17,580 --> 02:57:22,200
you're used to. It's more of like a gothic type theme. The freeze arrows are like blue

2479
02:57:22,200 --> 02:57:26,320
and stuff like that it's all pretty it's actually a pretty interesting one if you

2480
02:57:26,320 --> 02:57:30,500
download it just to see it if anything that was done by healing vision one of

2481
02:57:30,500 --> 02:57:34,900
the best fucking artists out there and really awesome sim file maker makes

2482
02:57:34,900 --> 02:57:44,820
everything just like official Konami mix so yeah what's up when made announcer

2483
02:57:44,820 --> 02:57:50,160
packs no actually twin all he did was he ripped announcers and he ripped up the

2484
02:57:50,160 --> 02:57:53,760
thing in fact he was actually bitching about that was one of the things he

2485
02:57:53,760 --> 02:57:56,880
bitches about me know a while back is he wanted me to send the announcer stuff

2486
02:57:56,880 --> 02:58:00,340
whatever you know that's cool that he released the announcers for solo and

2487
02:58:00,340 --> 02:58:05,220
shit even though I can lady oh yeah I have those on my computer I could have

2488
02:58:05,220 --> 02:58:08,400
released him at any point but you know I just don't care instead I'm just gonna

2489
02:58:08,400 --> 02:58:12,280
release them all at once it really doesn't matter to me he doesn't bother

2490
02:58:12,280 --> 02:58:18,840
me at all him him with his his announcer packs in high quality high res banners

2491
02:58:18,840 --> 02:58:22,840
That's all he can rip from the poor DDR discs.

2492
02:58:22,840 --> 02:58:24,840
How did he even get them?

2493
02:58:24,840 --> 02:58:26,840
It's just the same way I get them.

2494
02:58:26,840 --> 02:58:28,840
You just rip them from the arcade discs.

2495
02:58:28,840 --> 02:58:30,840
You know someone who gets the disc images.

2496
02:58:30,840 --> 02:58:31,840
Whoop-dee-doo.

2497
02:58:31,840 --> 02:58:33,840
So off of his Korean two discs, well guess what?

2498
02:58:33,840 --> 02:58:35,840
I own an official one.

2499
02:58:35,840 --> 02:58:37,840
Not that I care. Whatever.

2500
02:58:37,840 --> 02:58:39,840
Yeah, go ahead. Release your banners and stuff.

2501
02:58:39,840 --> 02:58:42,840
I'll release my site with 2,000 DWIs on it.

2502
02:58:42,840 --> 02:58:44,840
Yeah.

2503
02:58:44,840 --> 02:58:46,840
Alright.

2504
02:58:46,840 --> 02:59:03,080
me a follow-up. Angel says you want to email your AOL account?

2505
02:59:03,080 --> 02:59:06,920
One other quick thing I want to talk about before we go off the air tonight is waste

2506
02:59:06,920 --> 02:59:14,640
of time websites. We were talking about neopets.com. What a fucking waste of time. It's worse than

2507
02:59:14,640 --> 02:59:18,920
Animal Crossing.

2508
02:59:18,920 --> 02:59:22,360
This site is the best website ever.

2509
02:59:22,360 --> 02:59:26,440
It's madox.xmission.com.

2510
02:59:26,440 --> 02:59:35,560
It's madox.xmission.com and that's got the crazy guy who rants about different things

2511
02:59:35,560 --> 02:59:39,020
and he has some really funny ones on there.

2512
02:59:39,020 --> 02:59:41,440
So definitely check those out.

2513
02:59:41,440 --> 02:59:46,440
the one that's funny is one that um Vandalous posted in the Saki Mani forms

2514
02:59:46,440 --> 02:59:51,440
the one where they had the little Mario like video that the guy made it was um

2515
02:59:51,440 --> 02:59:56,880
it's called like Mac Daddy Mario was the was the topic on Saki Mani and the guy

2516
02:59:56,880 --> 03:00:01,120
actually went and made a bunch of little videos and movies using Nintendo

2517
03:00:01,120 --> 03:00:06,240
characters it's actually pretty cool they have like like one Mario's dancing

2518
03:00:06,240 --> 03:00:11,000
to like disco music and then each comes up to him and they're all and they start

2519
03:00:11,000 --> 03:00:16,940
dancing together, so it's actually pretty good, if not kind of cheesy.

2520
03:00:16,940 --> 03:00:23,240
Thesmokinggun.com. It's news, but it's really cool. And The Onion.

2521
03:00:23,240 --> 03:00:27,700
A new one that came up this week, nationstates.net. Yes, Dan does that.

2522
03:00:27,700 --> 03:00:31,700
Have you made your nation yet? I haven't yet, but Dan's done his Gunstaria.

2523
03:00:31,700 --> 03:00:39,260
Oh, okay. You know what? The DDR crew's got this lazy college students. There's a whole

2524
03:00:39,260 --> 03:00:43,620
much of Omani people getting into this thing. I'm even on it now. The queendom of Batston

2525
03:00:43,620 --> 03:00:45,940
is up. That's mine.

2526
03:00:45,940 --> 03:00:47,900
Maybe I should do Saqib Emaniyeh.

2527
03:00:47,900 --> 03:00:53,020
Hey, that'll be cool. You make your own nation and then you decide on issues and you run

2528
03:00:53,020 --> 03:00:57,860
it and you can be like an evil dictatorship or you can be Loki and telly your thing.

2529
03:00:57,860 --> 03:00:58,860
Telly your thing.

2530
03:00:58,860 --> 03:01:02,740
You know, I used to do something like that when I was in middle school. We would create

2531
03:01:02,740 --> 03:01:05,140
our countries and run it and everything and then we'd have a war.

2532
03:01:05,140 --> 03:01:12,980
That was funny, the way my country, or we did this thing in sociology, trying to depict

2533
03:01:12,980 --> 03:01:17,980
the best way society should be run, and the way it would work the best, and mine ended

2534
03:01:17,980 --> 03:01:23,740
up turning into, I don't know, neo-naziism.

2535
03:01:23,740 --> 03:01:27,100
That's the way mine was, but it worked, I don't know.

2536
03:01:27,100 --> 03:01:29,100
Maybe there's something to it.

2537
03:01:29,100 --> 03:01:34,740
I probably have a nice social estate.

2538
03:01:34,740 --> 03:01:38,220
Alright, I think we've got to wrap up the show now, because we're running over a little

2539
03:01:38,220 --> 03:01:39,220
bit.

2540
03:01:39,220 --> 03:01:44,620
I wanted to do the nation of Pacmania, and have the currency be the dot.

2541
03:01:44,620 --> 03:01:45,620
That's cool.

2542
03:01:45,620 --> 03:01:46,620
Can't you make more than one?

2543
03:01:46,620 --> 03:01:48,740
And the national animal be the ghost monster.

2544
03:01:48,740 --> 03:01:49,740
Oh.

2545
03:01:49,740 --> 03:01:54,740
Alright, we're running over a little bit, so final thoughts.

2546
03:01:54,740 --> 03:01:57,580
You dropped pussy all over.

2547
03:01:57,580 --> 03:02:02,300
Zero, any final thoughts for the day?

2548
03:02:02,300 --> 03:02:07,300
Not really. Just, I don't know, play more DDR and listen to the next shows.

2549
03:02:07,300 --> 03:02:11,300
I don't know. I'm dumb right now. Don't worry.

2550
03:02:11,300 --> 03:02:16,300
All work and no play makes me you.

2551
03:02:16,300 --> 03:02:17,300
Jamie?

2552
03:02:17,300 --> 03:02:22,300
Shrimp chips own your soul. It tastes like pussy.

2553
03:02:22,300 --> 03:02:23,300
Loki?

2554
03:02:23,300 --> 03:02:28,300
I've had a headache for 24 hours and so I can't wait till tomorrow.

2555
03:02:28,300 --> 03:02:34,300
almost got some last night. That close, that close. Story of my life, alright goodnight

And now, here's your fortune cookie message of the day.

2561
03:03:07,200 --> 03:03:09,200
Water rolls round stairs.

2562
03:03:09,200 --> 03:03:10,200
A boner and pears.

2563
03:03:10,200 --> 03:03:12,200
Pulls over your neighbor's dog.

2564
03:03:12,200 --> 03:03:13,200
Looks great for a snack.

2565
03:03:13,200 --> 03:03:14,200
It fits on your back.

2566
03:03:14,200 --> 03:03:16,200
It's long, long, long.

2567
03:03:16,200 --> 03:03:18,200
It's long, long.

2568
03:03:18,200 --> 03:03:20,200
It's big, it's heavy, it's wood.

2569
03:03:20,200 --> 03:03:22,200
It's long, long.

2570
03:03:22,200 --> 03:03:24,200
It's better than that, it's good.

2571
03:03:24,200 --> 03:03:26,200
Everyone wants a long.

2572
03:03:26,200 --> 03:03:28,200
You're gonna love it long.

2573
03:03:28,200 --> 03:03:30,200
Come on and get your long.

2574
03:03:30,200 --> 03:03:31,200
Everyone needs a long.

2575
03:03:31,200 --> 03:03:43,480
Thank you very much for listening, and we'll see you next week.
