[SPEAKER_10]: Because after like one day, I'll see that there's 75 messages in trash.

158
00:14:32,747 --> 00:14:33,708
[SPEAKER_22]: There's a bulk folder.

159
00:14:33,928 --> 00:14:38,011
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, 75 messages in trash, 26 in bulk, and like two in my other one.

160
00:14:38,111 --> 00:14:39,673
[SPEAKER_10]: And two that are actually in my inbox.

161
00:14:40,393 --> 00:14:41,034
[SPEAKER_10]: Both are spam.

162
00:14:44,338 --> 00:14:45,799
[SPEAKER_22]: You know, you can block the addresses.

163
00:14:46,499 --> 00:14:48,520
[SPEAKER_10]: I already have 100 blocked addresses.

164
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:49,240
[SPEAKER_22]: Jeez.

165
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:50,901
[SPEAKER_22]: I know.

166
00:14:51,361 --> 00:14:55,183
[SPEAKER_13]: Spammers are so high-tech nowadays that they change their address.

167
00:14:55,203 --> 00:14:57,004
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, they're emailing you from a new address each time.

168
00:14:57,044 --> 00:15:01,406
[SPEAKER_13]: So even if you block it, they just go to, you know, say you're getting spammed from Loki 1.

169
00:15:01,726 --> 00:15:03,246
[SPEAKER_13]: Then they'll just go to Loki 2 and Loki 3.

170
00:15:03,326 --> 00:15:05,147
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, what I'm starting to do now is block.

171
00:15:05,187 --> 00:15:07,048
[SPEAKER_10]: You can block domains on there also.

172
00:15:07,468 --> 00:15:07,988
[SPEAKER_13]: Block AOL.

173
00:15:08,109 --> 00:15:08,529
[SPEAKER_13]: Just kidding.

174
00:15:12,456 --> 00:15:14,478
[SPEAKER_13]: One thing though that people should realize...

175
00:15:36,475 --> 00:15:43,239
[SPEAKER_22]: If you want a lot of that information we're getting into and don't want telemarketer calls, whenever a telemarketer calls you, tell them to opt you out.

176
00:15:43,739 --> 00:15:45,220
[SPEAKER_22]: It is a federal privacy law.

177
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:46,900
[SPEAKER_22]: I work for a mortgage company now.

178
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:48,341
[SPEAKER_22]: I used to work in customer service for one.

179
00:15:48,921 --> 00:15:49,922
[SPEAKER_22]: Tell them to opt you out.

180
00:15:49,982 --> 00:15:53,964
[SPEAKER_22]: If you have a mortgage, if you live with people who have a mortgage, tell them to have...

181
00:15:54,524 --> 00:15:55,625
[SPEAKER_22]: They're a servicer.

182
00:15:55,905 --> 00:15:59,686
[SPEAKER_22]: Opt you out of all outside communication not to share your information.

183
00:16:00,206 --> 00:16:06,809
[SPEAKER_22]: Call the three credit bureau reporting... I'm trying to remember what they are off the top of my head.

184
00:16:06,849 --> 00:16:09,550
[SPEAKER_22]: There's Equifax.

185
00:16:10,731 --> 00:16:11,871
[SPEAKER_22]: There's one of... not Equifax.

186
00:16:12,471 --> 00:16:13,292
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, Equifax.

187
00:16:13,852 --> 00:16:15,433
[SPEAKER_22]: There's two others, but I don't remember off the top of my head.

188
00:16:16,153 --> 00:16:20,835
[SPEAKER_22]: But you can also write your credit bureaus and have them not share your information because that's the primary way they get it.

189
00:16:21,095 --> 00:16:24,997
[SPEAKER_13]: I was going to say, a lot of people also know it as the don't call list.

190
00:16:25,218 --> 00:16:27,759
[SPEAKER_13]: If you tell a telemarketer to put you on the don't call list, then they have to.

191
00:16:27,939 --> 00:16:30,101
[SPEAKER_13]: Otherwise, that's breaking the law.

192
00:16:30,761 --> 00:16:30,981
[SPEAKER_22]: Yep.

193
00:16:31,922 --> 00:16:33,002
[SPEAKER_22]: But that right there.

194
00:16:33,483 --> 00:16:40,247
[SPEAKER_22]: Since we used to get about two, three telemarketer calls a night sometimes, I called one of them.

195
00:16:40,307 --> 00:16:41,147
[SPEAKER_22]: I said, opt us out.

196
00:16:41,648 --> 00:16:43,529
[SPEAKER_22]: We didn't get a single one for the next month.

197
00:16:43,988 --> 00:16:46,350
[SPEAKER_10]: And for junk mail, if you want it, this is great.

198
00:16:46,810 --> 00:16:50,893
[SPEAKER_10]: Maddox, from his wonderful site, recommended this.

199
00:16:51,173 --> 00:17:07,184
[SPEAKER_10]: When you get those credit card applications in the mail, take your junk mail, stick them in the nice little prepaid envelope given to you by the credit card mailer, and look, you got rid of your junk mail and the stupid credit card company stopped mailing you because you're sending them back junk mail.

200
00:17:08,605 --> 00:17:09,666
[SPEAKER_22]: You can also just write...

201
00:17:10,347 --> 00:17:13,488
[SPEAKER_22]: Three lovely words on top of every last bit of that junk mail.

202
00:17:14,008 --> 00:17:14,888
[SPEAKER_22]: Return to sender.

203
00:17:16,509 --> 00:17:16,909
[SPEAKER_22]: It works.

204
00:17:18,389 --> 00:17:20,710
[SPEAKER_14]: Or deceased.

205
00:17:20,730 --> 00:17:21,650
[SPEAKER_14]: Deceased is great.

206
00:17:22,170 --> 00:17:24,811
[SPEAKER_14]: When you write deceased, you don't get it mailed anymore.

207
00:17:25,511 --> 00:17:27,472
[SPEAKER_14]: I've done that with a couple of them.

208
00:17:27,532 --> 00:17:28,052
[SPEAKER_13]: It works.

209
00:17:28,472 --> 00:17:29,833
[SPEAKER_13]: That's messed up, but funny.

210
00:17:30,833 --> 00:17:31,873
[SPEAKER_13]: Wasn't that an old 80s song?

211
00:17:31,933 --> 00:17:33,894
[SPEAKER_13]: Return to sender, I guess.

212
00:17:33,914 --> 00:17:34,314
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't know.

213
00:17:34,374 --> 00:17:34,614
[SPEAKER_21]: Anyway.

214
00:17:35,214 --> 00:17:36,295
[SPEAKER_13]: There's a big bandaid on it.

215
00:17:55,602 --> 00:18:06,327
[SPEAKER_13]: If you're not being able to get in through your normal means, go ahead and go to our Java page at orangelounge.skie.cx Click on chat and use the Java applet because the server that the Java applet points to works fine.

216
00:18:06,787 --> 00:18:07,527
[SPEAKER_13]: So you can use that.

217
00:18:08,328 --> 00:18:10,929
[SPEAKER_13]: Cool, huh?

218
00:18:11,589 --> 00:18:12,469
[SPEAKER_13]: Jamie brought treats.

219
00:18:13,830 --> 00:18:15,291
[SPEAKER_13]: What kind of treats did you bring tonight, Jamie?

220
00:18:15,311 --> 00:18:16,151
[SPEAKER_22]: Shrimp chips.

221
00:18:17,332 --> 00:18:20,933
[SPEAKER_22]: Because every snack I get has to have some kind of connotation.

222
00:18:21,413 --> 00:18:22,834
[SPEAKER_22]: So I got shrimp chips this time.

223
00:18:24,210 --> 00:18:25,251
[SPEAKER_22]: and Sweet Potato Chips.

224
00:18:26,031 --> 00:18:27,652
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't like shrimp chips.

225
00:18:27,692 --> 00:18:30,473
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, they're okay, but they just, they're so weird to me.

226
00:18:30,533 --> 00:18:35,876
[SPEAKER_13]: Like, when I eat shrimp, I expect to be eating, like, Long John Silver's Ghetto Deep Fried Shrimp.

227
00:18:37,676 --> 00:18:38,517
[SPEAKER_21]: Mmm, shrimpy.

228
00:18:39,737 --> 00:18:40,798
[SPEAKER_22]: They don't really taste like shrimp.

229
00:18:41,418 --> 00:18:42,439
[SPEAKER_10]: They smell like ass.

230
00:18:43,339 --> 00:18:44,300
[SPEAKER_10]: Or, actually.

231
00:18:46,401 --> 00:18:47,661
[SPEAKER_10]: They smell like rank pussy.

232
00:18:47,801 --> 00:18:48,722
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what it smells like.

233
00:18:49,502 --> 00:18:50,082
[SPEAKER_22]: They're yummy.

234
00:18:51,143 --> 00:18:52,063
[SPEAKER_22]: Damn it, I like pussy.

235
00:18:52,183 --> 00:18:52,704
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean, wait.

236
00:18:54,844 --> 00:18:57,285
[SPEAKER_13]: So how was the drunk show last week?

237
00:18:57,405 --> 00:19:04,508
[SPEAKER_13]: I wasn't here to experience it, unfortunately, but this is something EOSFBB gave me a link to.

238
00:19:04,528 --> 00:19:05,288
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll get to it in a minute.

239
00:19:05,829 --> 00:19:07,249
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, how did things go last week?

240
00:19:07,869 --> 00:19:08,610
[SPEAKER_22]: I was drunk.

241
00:19:08,790 --> 00:19:09,470
[SPEAKER_13]: I haven't listened to it.

242
00:19:09,530 --> 00:19:10,530
[SPEAKER_13]: How drunk did you guys get?

243
00:19:10,751 --> 00:19:11,211
[SPEAKER_22]: Not very.

244
00:19:11,331 --> 00:19:11,931
[SPEAKER_22]: Not me, anyway.

245
00:19:12,611 --> 00:19:13,592
[SPEAKER_22]: Melody was really silly.

246
00:19:14,232 --> 00:19:16,033
[SPEAKER_22]: I just got, like, drunk.

247
00:19:16,133 --> 00:19:17,133
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay, this is what I had.

248
00:19:18,834 --> 00:19:19,194
[SPEAKER_22]: I had...

249
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:30,389
[SPEAKER_22]: About four things of... Actually, I drank out of this flask of... What was that Dutch chocolate liqueur that Melody brought?

250
00:19:30,609 --> 00:19:31,609
[SPEAKER_22]: Kahlua?

251
00:19:31,669 --> 00:19:33,350
[SPEAKER_22]: No, it's Dutch chocolate.

252
00:19:34,031 --> 00:19:34,971
[SPEAKER_22]: Really good chocolate liqueur.

253
00:19:35,992 --> 00:19:40,194
[SPEAKER_22]: I had a few swallows of that out of the flask.

254
00:19:40,214 --> 00:19:43,236
[SPEAKER_13]: You were drinking straight out of the bottle.

255
00:19:43,356 --> 00:19:47,878
[SPEAKER_22]: I made this drink with vanilla soy milk and Godiva liqueur.

256
00:19:49,019 --> 00:19:50,260
[SPEAKER_22]: No, this one brand of soy milk.

257
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:51,260
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm making a face.

258
00:19:51,721 --> 00:19:53,802
[SPEAKER_22]: This one brand of soy milk, you can't even tell it's soy milk.

259
00:19:53,862 --> 00:19:55,103
[SPEAKER_22]: It's very creamy like real milk.

260
00:19:56,363 --> 00:19:56,944
[SPEAKER_13]: Mmm, creamy.

261
00:19:57,364 --> 00:19:57,684
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh yeah.

262
00:19:57,764 --> 00:19:58,925
[SPEAKER_22]: I do, I do, I do.

263
00:19:59,605 --> 00:20:00,926
[SPEAKER_22]: Um, yeah, whatever.

264
00:20:02,647 --> 00:20:06,349
[SPEAKER_22]: Um, but it was, I had like four of those or something.

265
00:20:06,870 --> 00:20:10,011
[SPEAKER_22]: And then, um, I had, um, a shot of vodka.

266
00:20:10,572 --> 00:20:11,292
[SPEAKER_22]: No, it wasn't vodka.

267
00:20:11,312 --> 00:20:11,893
[SPEAKER_22]: I had a shot of rum.

268
00:20:13,293 --> 00:20:18,977
[SPEAKER_22]: I had, um, three of those, um,

269
00:20:22,394 --> 00:20:25,376
[SPEAKER_22]: The Smirnoff Ice Triple Blacks Oh, those are so good.

270
00:20:26,617 --> 00:20:29,738
[SPEAKER_13]: Did anyone get super crazy or naked or super... No.

271
00:20:30,238 --> 00:20:33,320
[SPEAKER_22]: Everybody went... Ross brought a 40 of St.

272
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:33,660
[SPEAKER_22]: Ives.

273
00:20:34,461 --> 00:20:36,822
[SPEAKER_10]: No, but the show went south when I brought my video over.

274
00:20:37,742 --> 00:20:40,764
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, everyone went downstairs to watch this video right here.

275
00:20:40,784 --> 00:20:41,825
[SPEAKER_13]: The Ron Jeremy porn star video.

276
00:20:41,845 --> 00:20:43,325
[SPEAKER_22]: Which I bought so we could watch it after the show.

277
00:20:43,345 --> 00:20:43,405
[SPEAKER_22]: Yay!

278
00:20:43,906 --> 00:20:46,307
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I want to see it.

279
00:20:46,327 --> 00:20:46,727
[SPEAKER_11]: I heard about it.

280
00:20:46,747 --> 00:20:48,008
[SPEAKER_22]: Ron Jeremy can kiss his own penis.

281
00:20:48,668 --> 00:20:49,589
[SPEAKER_11]: How exciting.

282
00:20:50,373 --> 00:20:52,795
[SPEAKER_22]: I always have wanted to see a man kiss his own penis.

283
00:20:54,075 --> 00:20:54,756
[SPEAKER_22]: Not really.

284
00:20:56,297 --> 00:20:56,817
[SPEAKER_12]: Not you.

285
00:20:58,879 --> 00:21:05,523
[SPEAKER_13]: I just did this little jerk motion that made me look like I was about to do it and Jamie got scared.

286
00:21:06,463 --> 00:21:07,924
[SPEAKER_13]: What are these, sweet potato chips?

287
00:21:08,004 --> 00:21:08,825
[SPEAKER_13]: Uh-huh, they're yummy.

288
00:21:09,045 --> 00:21:09,826
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's read the back.

289
00:21:09,986 --> 00:21:15,729
[SPEAKER_13]: Sweet potato chips is made with sweet potato and made at Golden Crunch, containing no preservatives and no cholesterol.

290
00:21:16,130 --> 00:21:17,891
[SPEAKER_13]: It's an ideal snack for all ages.

291
00:21:18,527 --> 00:21:19,187
[SPEAKER_22]: Eat some!

292
00:21:19,888 --> 00:21:20,308
[SPEAKER_22]: Eat it!

293
00:21:20,648 --> 00:21:21,108
[SPEAKER_22]: Eat it!

294
00:21:25,431 --> 00:21:25,671
[SPEAKER_22]: Well?

295
00:21:26,631 --> 00:21:27,152
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, they're okay.

296
00:21:27,292 --> 00:21:28,392
[SPEAKER_13]: They're no Pringles, but they're good.

297
00:21:29,173 --> 00:21:29,773
[SPEAKER_21]: This is better.

298
00:21:29,793 --> 00:21:32,414
[SPEAKER_21]: They may not have sweet potatoes, and they're yummy.

299
00:21:32,634 --> 00:21:33,655
[SPEAKER_13]: What happened with Match Game?

300
00:21:33,755 --> 00:21:35,216
[SPEAKER_13]: People in the chatroom were talking about Match Game.

301
00:21:35,596 --> 00:21:36,837
[SPEAKER_21]: We kept talking about Ron Jeremy.

302
00:21:37,577 --> 00:21:38,237
[SPEAKER_13]: Jesus.

303
00:21:39,718 --> 00:21:41,119
[SPEAKER_21]: I didn't save it, unfortunately.

304
00:21:41,379 --> 00:21:42,920
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, speaking of kissing penis...

305
00:21:44,911 --> 00:21:51,656
[SPEAKER_13]: EOSFEB wanted me to share this article with you all Mr. Spanky, Mr. Spanky Oh, you want Mr. Spanky to do it?

306
00:21:52,536 --> 00:22:09,988
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, we'll get Mr. Spanky in here Hold on, we gotta call Mr. Spanky Jamie, call Mr. Spanky Mr. Spanky Then why don't you call Mr. Spanky?

307
00:22:11,850 --> 00:22:12,570
[SPEAKER_13]: What the fuck?

308
00:22:13,571 --> 00:22:13,711
[SPEAKER_13]: No

309
00:22:16,306 --> 00:22:17,587
[SPEAKER_21]: Paging Mr. Spanky.

310
00:22:18,127 --> 00:22:20,829
[SPEAKER_21]: Mr. Spanky, you have a call at the front desk.

311
00:22:22,109 --> 00:22:23,310
[SPEAKER_08]: We have a winner!

312
00:22:26,992 --> 00:22:29,213
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. Spanky would now like to read you this article.

313
00:22:30,674 --> 00:22:33,516
[SPEAKER_08]: It's called, Teens Asked to Consider Oral Sex.

314
00:22:34,958 --> 00:22:45,323
[SPEAKER_08]: In London, school children under 16 are being encouraged to experiment with oral sex as part of a government-backed drive to cut Britain's sky-high teenage pregnancy rate.

315
00:22:45,823 --> 00:22:54,467
[SPEAKER_08]: The Times said the scheme, pioneered by a university and backed by the Department of Health and Education, trains teachers to discuss pre-sex stopping points.

316
00:22:56,968 --> 00:23:04,973
[SPEAKER_08]: The idea is to reduce promiscuity by encouraging pupils to discover levels of intimacy, including oral sex, instead of full sexual intercourse.

317
00:23:05,594 --> 00:23:10,617
[SPEAKER_08]: But family campaigners condemn the accord, saying it would only encourage children to experiment with sex.

318
00:23:15,365 --> 00:23:23,088
[SPEAKER_08]: The director of the Family Education Trust told the newspaper, I don't think that anyone believes that teaching people about oral sex will stop them from having full sex.

319
00:23:23,548 --> 00:23:25,389
[SPEAKER_08]: It's more likely to make them want to try it.

320
00:23:25,449 --> 00:23:28,130
[SPEAKER_08]: It doesn't protect them against sexually transmitted diseases.

321
00:23:29,991 --> 00:23:31,251
[SPEAKER_22]: Tell us about that, Mr. Spanky.

322
00:23:31,271 --> 00:23:32,952
[SPEAKER_08]: Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

323
00:23:33,432 --> 00:23:34,252
[SPEAKER_08]: Blah, blah, blah.

324
00:23:34,372 --> 00:23:37,493
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, Britain has the highest teenage pregnancy rate in Western Europe.

325
00:23:37,533 --> 00:23:39,794
[SPEAKER_08]: The government has a set target of halving levels by 2010.

326
00:23:41,315 --> 00:23:41,735
[SPEAKER_08]: Bye!

327
00:23:42,115 --> 00:23:43,316
[SPEAKER_22]: Tell us about the diseases.

328
00:23:43,816 --> 00:23:43,916
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

329
00:23:47,822 --> 00:23:48,423
[SPEAKER_13]: I put a spell on you!

330
00:24:07,202 --> 00:24:10,623
[SPEAKER_13]: I wanted to read some of the Yahoo Talkbacks here.

331
00:24:10,783 --> 00:24:13,945
[SPEAKER_13]: There's nothing better on Yahoo News than Yahoo Talkbacks.

332
00:24:14,325 --> 00:24:15,085
[SPEAKER_13]: You gonna go get some juice?

333
00:24:16,466 --> 00:24:16,826
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's see.

334
00:24:17,006 --> 00:24:19,167
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, we have God is the answer.

335
00:24:21,414 --> 00:24:22,475
[SPEAKER_13]: I think that it's terrible.

336
00:24:22,535 --> 00:24:24,076
[SPEAKER_13]: They should teach them about God.

337
00:24:24,416 --> 00:24:25,497
[SPEAKER_13]: They should focus.

338
00:24:25,617 --> 00:24:26,778
[SPEAKER_13]: The should focus.

339
00:24:27,238 --> 00:24:28,719
[SPEAKER_13]: This guy's got a great education here.

340
00:24:29,139 --> 00:24:30,981
[SPEAKER_13]: The should focus in what the Bible says.

341
00:24:31,061 --> 00:24:32,722
[SPEAKER_13]: Want to give a good advice.

342
00:24:32,882 --> 00:24:33,783
[SPEAKER_13]: Get it from the Bible.

343
00:24:34,203 --> 00:24:35,144
[SPEAKER_13]: That sounds like English.

344
00:24:38,446 --> 00:24:40,207
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm sorry, what did you say?

345
00:24:40,768 --> 00:24:41,948
[SPEAKER_09]: He was educated in Britain.

346
00:24:43,289 --> 00:24:44,350
[SPEAKER_13]: God is the answer.

347
00:24:44,690 --> 00:24:45,251
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's see.

348
00:24:45,331 --> 00:24:46,892
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's look at re-God is the answer.

349
00:24:46,912 --> 00:24:49,634
[SPEAKER_10]: We could have been saying dog is the answer, but we wouldn't know.

350
00:24:51,192 --> 00:24:52,773
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's see, God is the answer.

351
00:24:56,276 --> 00:24:57,717
[SPEAKER_13]: None of these replies are any good.

352
00:24:59,038 --> 00:25:01,520
[SPEAKER_13]: I also think it's terrible that they should teach them about God.

353
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:03,361
[SPEAKER_13]: Religion and school doesn't mix.

354
00:25:03,782 --> 00:25:06,303
[SPEAKER_13]: But sex ed is a real issue, not some religious one.

355
00:25:07,104 --> 00:25:08,005
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's see what else is there.

356
00:25:08,065 --> 00:25:08,705
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, this is good.

357
00:25:10,407 --> 00:25:12,428
[SPEAKER_13]: This person says, teach hygiene first.

358
00:25:13,029 --> 00:25:18,673
[SPEAKER_13]: Washing of antiseptic solution like betadine or chlorhexidine to keep it clean and fresh at all times.

359
00:25:21,224 --> 00:25:23,125
[SPEAKER_13]: or, you know, oh, never mind, Jamie's not in the room right now.

360
00:25:24,006 --> 00:25:27,348
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, here's one, GreatStuff98 says, why not anal?

361
00:25:27,928 --> 00:25:29,830
[SPEAKER_13]: I thought they were also pushing that for a bit.

362
00:25:30,210 --> 00:25:32,792
[SPEAKER_13]: Really weird, kids need to be kids and forget about the sex thing.

363
00:25:36,194 --> 00:25:38,615
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's see, one more, one more, let's see.

364
00:25:39,416 --> 00:25:41,477
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's see, they should teach good hand jobs.

365
00:25:42,798 --> 00:25:44,259
[SPEAKER_13]: Lucky be the man who's skilled at hand.

366
00:25:44,359 --> 00:25:45,019
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, alright, alright.

367
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:48,362
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you for bringing this show down to a whole new level, ESVB.

368
00:25:52,870 --> 00:25:53,970
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm sorry I had to burp there.

369
00:25:55,991 --> 00:25:58,752
[SPEAKER_13]: It's weird being gone for like a week and having to come back.

370
00:25:58,812 --> 00:26:00,792
[SPEAKER_13]: It's like I feel like I haven't done this for like a whole month.

371
00:26:02,073 --> 00:26:02,473
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

372
00:26:03,113 --> 00:26:04,953
[SPEAKER_13]: Anything else of interest happen last week, Loki?

373
00:26:06,154 --> 00:26:06,514
[SPEAKER_10]: No.

374
00:26:08,054 --> 00:26:08,434
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

375
00:26:09,975 --> 00:26:10,155
[SPEAKER_10]: No.

376
00:26:10,515 --> 00:26:11,515
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

377
00:26:12,095 --> 00:26:14,316
[SPEAKER_10]: I want more metal pads off the eBay.

378
00:26:14,336 --> 00:26:14,456
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

379
00:26:15,504 --> 00:26:16,045
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, you know what?

380
00:26:16,125 --> 00:26:19,868
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm going to be giving away... I'm going to get these.

381
00:26:19,908 --> 00:26:21,810
[SPEAKER_13]: My friend Matt is going to give them to me for free.

382
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:23,952
[SPEAKER_13]: My other friend Matt is going to give them to me for free.

383
00:26:24,232 --> 00:26:25,873
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think we might do some kind of giveaway.

384
00:26:26,014 --> 00:26:27,995
[SPEAKER_13]: It's going to have to be a more local giveaway.

385
00:26:28,196 --> 00:26:29,597
[SPEAKER_13]: They're wannabe ignition pads.

386
00:26:30,117 --> 00:26:32,379
[SPEAKER_13]: They're not ignition pads, but they're the knockoff wannabe kind.

387
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:35,702
[SPEAKER_13]: And I don't really have a use for them, so I think we're going to do some kind of giveaway.

388
00:26:35,742 --> 00:26:38,625
[SPEAKER_13]: I just don't know how yet, because I can't afford to ship them to anybody.

389
00:26:39,085 --> 00:26:41,187
[SPEAKER_13]: So they're going to have to be some kind of local giveaway.

390
00:26:41,267 --> 00:26:41,668
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know.

391
00:26:42,819 --> 00:26:45,581
[SPEAKER_10]: We should, like, just hook them up and see how badly we can thrash them.

392
00:26:46,902 --> 00:26:48,423
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, you just want to beat them up on air?

393
00:26:50,044 --> 00:26:52,826
[SPEAKER_13]: We could dissect a wannabe ignition pad live on air.

394
00:26:52,846 --> 00:26:53,406
[SPEAKER_10]: That would be fun.

395
00:26:53,546 --> 00:26:54,507
[SPEAKER_10]: No, that's stupid.

396
00:26:54,547 --> 00:26:55,188
[SPEAKER_10]: I've done it before.

397
00:26:57,469 --> 00:27:00,611
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, we could set it on fire, except we have no place to set it on fire at.

398
00:27:02,312 --> 00:27:02,973
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, here.

399
00:27:03,033 --> 00:27:03,653
[SPEAKER_10]: That smells good.

400
00:27:03,713 --> 00:27:04,214
[SPEAKER_13]: What is that?

401
00:27:04,774 --> 00:27:05,775
[SPEAKER_13]: It looks like blood.

402
00:27:06,916 --> 00:27:07,676
[SPEAKER_13]: It looks like blood.

403
00:27:08,417 --> 00:27:09,497
[SPEAKER_13]: Jamie brought blood back here.

404
00:27:09,517 --> 00:27:09,898
[SPEAKER_10]: That's, uh...

405
00:27:11,847 --> 00:27:12,948
[SPEAKER_10]: Cranberry Grape?

406
00:27:18,350 --> 00:27:18,630
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyway.

407
00:27:18,950 --> 00:27:21,451
[SPEAKER_22]: It's Cranberry Apple Martinellis.

408
00:27:22,051 --> 00:27:23,112
[SPEAKER_13]: You know Giant Matt, right?

409
00:27:23,792 --> 00:27:24,032
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

410
00:27:24,092 --> 00:27:26,493
[SPEAKER_13]: Giant Matt's giving me two wannabe ignition pads.

411
00:27:26,533 --> 00:27:28,394
[SPEAKER_13]: They're not ignition pads, they're the wannabe ones.

412
00:27:28,894 --> 00:27:29,915
[SPEAKER_13]: Some third party ignition pads.

413
00:27:30,855 --> 00:27:32,436
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know, I was thinking we could do some kind of giveaway.

414
00:27:32,456 --> 00:27:32,756
[SPEAKER_13]: Give it to me.

415
00:27:33,676 --> 00:27:34,817
[SPEAKER_13]: You just want me to give them to you?

416
00:27:34,837 --> 00:27:35,277
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

417
00:27:35,397 --> 00:27:36,418
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, I wanted to do a giveaway.

418
00:27:36,498 --> 00:27:37,118
[SPEAKER_22]: I want to borrow it.

419
00:27:37,918 --> 00:27:40,080
[SPEAKER_13]: Why don't I give you one and then we can give the other one away?

420
00:27:40,420 --> 00:27:40,620
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay.

421
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:41,141
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

422
00:27:41,981 --> 00:27:45,364
[SPEAKER_13]: But we can't afford for shipping, although some people are saying they'll pay for shipping.

423
00:27:45,404 --> 00:27:47,085
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, we'll think of some kind of contest.

424
00:27:47,346 --> 00:27:47,946
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe we can do something.

425
00:27:47,966 --> 00:27:49,968
[SPEAKER_22]: How about the DWI contest?

426
00:27:51,509 --> 00:27:52,990
[SPEAKER_13]: Ah, okay.

427
00:27:53,611 --> 00:27:56,513
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, so that's going to be part of the prize for the DWI contest.

428
00:27:56,573 --> 00:27:57,654
[SPEAKER_13]: I like what you think.

429
00:27:58,034 --> 00:27:59,055
[SPEAKER_13]: I like the way this woman thinks.

430
00:27:59,675 --> 00:28:00,616
[SPEAKER_21]: That's because I think.

431
00:28:00,896 --> 00:28:01,217
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

432
00:28:01,657 --> 00:28:02,638
[SPEAKER_13]: I think, therefore I am.

433
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:11,104
[SPEAKER_13]: We're all going to be at, I was thinking we could do some kind of giveaway at B3, some kind of random door prize or something, I don't know though how that's all going to work.

434
00:28:11,164 --> 00:28:18,209
[SPEAKER_13]: B3 details are still being formed, although that is happening in May, May something through 17th, I don't know what it is, sometime in May.

435
00:28:18,229 --> 00:28:18,869
[SPEAKER_13]: I have an announcement.

436
00:28:19,610 --> 00:28:20,430
[SPEAKER_13]: You have an announcement?

437
00:28:20,890 --> 00:28:21,211
[SPEAKER_13]: Woohoo!

438
00:28:21,351 --> 00:28:23,032
[SPEAKER_13]: Announcements, announcements, alright, give your announcement.

439
00:28:23,192 --> 00:28:31,037
[SPEAKER_22]: We have a date set on the date of March 29th and March 30th, a tournament more usually held in the Bay Area.

440
00:28:31,738 --> 00:28:33,759
[SPEAKER_22]: It's going to be held at Scandia in Sacramento.

441
00:28:34,830 --> 00:28:35,531
[SPEAKER_22]: March Madness!

442
00:28:36,192 --> 00:28:37,454
[SPEAKER_03]: Yay!

443
00:28:38,355 --> 00:28:44,143
[SPEAKER_22]: We'll have details up on that, and by next week we should be able to give people links to where the rules are and all that information.

444
00:28:44,904 --> 00:28:49,410
[SPEAKER_22]: But be prepared, this one is not going to be just perfect attack.

445
00:28:49,550 --> 00:28:52,093
[SPEAKER_22]: This one's also going to be freestyle, and freestyle will be rather...

446
00:28:53,214 --> 00:28:55,095
[SPEAKER_13]: Can you tell us more about that at this time?

447
00:28:56,056 --> 00:28:57,437
[SPEAKER_13]: Even if I could, I wouldn't.

448
00:28:57,497 --> 00:28:57,877
[SPEAKER_13]: Not yet.

449
00:28:58,037 --> 00:29:01,619
[SPEAKER_13]: I've heard the proposition that they're doing for Freestyle.

450
00:29:02,319 --> 00:29:04,200
[SPEAKER_13]: It is going to kick so much ass.

451
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:09,443
[SPEAKER_13]: This is really funny because on the drive down to SoCal, we were talking about the exact same thing.

452
00:29:09,463 --> 00:29:12,225
[SPEAKER_13]: And I said, I want to see that happen in Sacramento.

453
00:29:12,805 --> 00:29:14,306
[SPEAKER_13]: And lo and behold, it's going to.

454
00:29:14,966 --> 00:29:15,326
[SPEAKER_13]: Awesome.

455
00:29:16,007 --> 00:29:19,468
[SPEAKER_13]: So once again, March Madness, March 29th and 30th.

456
00:29:20,749 --> 00:29:21,449
[SPEAKER_22]: Sacramento, Scandia.

457
00:29:21,629 --> 00:29:22,690
[SPEAKER_13]: Sacramento, Scandia.

458
00:29:22,790 --> 00:29:24,310
[SPEAKER_13]: Be here or die.

459
00:29:24,350 --> 00:29:25,090
[SPEAKER_22]: Or we'll kick your ass.

460
00:29:26,491 --> 00:29:26,891
[SPEAKER_13]: That's it.

461
00:29:27,111 --> 00:29:27,311
[SPEAKER_13]: Ding.

462
00:29:27,911 --> 00:29:29,172
[SPEAKER_13]: More details forthcoming.

463
00:29:29,212 --> 00:29:33,793
[SPEAKER_13]: Keep your eyes on... I don't know if we'll get to be affiliated to that.

464
00:29:33,833 --> 00:29:35,613
[SPEAKER_22]: I can't say, oh, Sacramento sucks.

465
00:29:36,414 --> 00:29:37,014
[SPEAKER_22]: Do you know what I do?

466
00:29:37,314 --> 00:29:40,235
[SPEAKER_13]: I was just told that on Friday.

467
00:29:42,355 --> 00:29:45,136
[SPEAKER_22]: You were told that by someone whose opinion doesn't count.

468
00:29:45,696 --> 00:29:45,957
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, yes.

469
00:29:47,197 --> 00:29:47,437
[SPEAKER_22]: Anyway.

470
00:29:49,131 --> 00:29:51,513
[SPEAKER_13]: You're already getting offers in the chat room to help with the tournament.

471
00:29:51,533 --> 00:29:53,314
[SPEAKER_13]: Stay tuned to DDR Freak.

472
00:29:53,334 --> 00:29:54,174
[SPEAKER_13]: We'll have a thread on it.

473
00:29:54,194 --> 00:29:55,996
[SPEAKER_13]: Sackbimani will have a thread on it for sure.

474
00:29:56,196 --> 00:29:56,956
[SPEAKER_22]: I will go ahead and say this.

475
00:29:56,976 --> 00:30:01,379
[SPEAKER_22]: There will be a meeting at my house for people who are in the area or can make it to the area.

476
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:09,104
[SPEAKER_22]: Just send me a private message on Sackbimani.com to DarkSakura and I'll take any offers of assistance I can.

477
00:30:09,785 --> 00:30:09,985
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

478
00:30:10,874 --> 00:30:13,096
[SPEAKER_13]: Hopefully I'll be participating in that too.

479
00:30:14,437 --> 00:30:15,298
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, I can't say it.

480
00:30:15,538 --> 00:30:18,081
[SPEAKER_13]: I can't say it until more details come out.

481
00:30:18,101 --> 00:30:19,182
[SPEAKER_13]: How about you say the voice?

482
00:30:19,242 --> 00:30:19,622
[SPEAKER_03]: The voice.

483
00:30:20,543 --> 00:30:20,803
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

484
00:30:20,903 --> 00:30:24,727
[SPEAKER_13]: When more details come out, we'll be a little... We won't be so dodgy.

485
00:30:25,727 --> 00:30:26,648
[SPEAKER_13]: But you heard it here first.

486
00:30:26,969 --> 00:30:27,449
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, you did.

487
00:30:27,549 --> 00:30:28,550
[SPEAKER_13]: Or second or third, I don't know.

488
00:30:28,870 --> 00:30:29,191
[SPEAKER_13]: First!

489
00:30:29,571 --> 00:30:34,415
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyway, speaking of tournaments, let's get to the CyberBeat tape, shall we?

490
00:30:34,555 --> 00:30:36,157
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's hear some of the CyberBeat stuff.

491
00:30:36,177 --> 00:30:36,357
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

492
00:30:37,593 --> 00:30:40,795
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh God, we're just going to hear, what we're going to do is we're going to play some clips.

493
00:30:40,815 --> 00:30:47,180
[SPEAKER_13]: We're not going to play because there's literally probably about an hour and a half of tape from the Cyber Beat trip, from the LA trip.

494
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:49,261
[SPEAKER_13]: However, a lot of it is very random.

495
00:30:49,701 --> 00:30:54,204
[SPEAKER_13]: I swear to God, Wendell went off for 20 minutes telling us a story about Mike Ngo, which is really funny.

496
00:30:54,905 --> 00:30:56,866
[SPEAKER_13]: But, you know, we just don't have the time to do that on this show right now.

497
00:30:56,886 --> 00:30:58,067
[SPEAKER_14]: But you'll have to tune in to hear that.

498
00:30:58,087 --> 00:31:00,429
[SPEAKER_13]: That's right, so if you want to hear that, you've got to tune in.

499
00:31:01,369 --> 00:31:11,581
[SPEAKER_13]: on Tuesday at 7 o'clock Pacific Time or Saturday at 4 o'clock Pacific Time.

500
00:31:11,621 --> 00:31:14,624
[SPEAKER_13]: Those are the two times we're going to be airing the Cyber Beat full tapes.

501
00:31:14,964 --> 00:31:20,050
[SPEAKER_13]: But in the meantime, we're going to play some clips for you because these are interviews that we did with some folks.

502
00:31:22,074 --> 00:31:25,757
[SPEAKER_13]: And the first set is going to be an excerpt from Saturday.

503
00:31:26,138 --> 00:31:31,002
[SPEAKER_13]: This is the day that PA wrapped up, so we're going to hear from the winner of Perfect Attack.

504
00:31:31,903 --> 00:31:36,006
[SPEAKER_13]: And we're going to hear some stuff starting off in the hotel room before we left.

505
00:31:36,467 --> 00:31:40,430
[SPEAKER_13]: We have another quick interview of somebody that came to visit us in our hotel room before we go.

506
00:31:40,831 --> 00:31:43,193
[SPEAKER_13]: So we're going to go to those tapes and we'll be right back.

507
00:31:43,713 --> 00:31:46,195
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, actually we'll be here because we might want to comment on how this is going.

508
00:31:46,335 --> 00:31:47,576
[SPEAKER_13]: So, here we go.

509
00:31:48,925 --> 00:31:50,386
[SPEAKER_13]: Wait, actually, wait, I don't think they're on yet.

510
00:31:50,406 --> 00:31:52,788
[SPEAKER_13]: Hold on, I gotta turn on the mixer.

511
00:31:53,628 --> 00:31:54,769
[SPEAKER_13]: I know what I'm doing.

512
00:31:55,490 --> 00:31:56,210
[SPEAKER_13]: You know what?

513
00:31:57,211 --> 00:31:58,772
[SPEAKER_22]: Alright, here we go, let's see.

514
00:31:59,712 --> 00:32:01,153
[SPEAKER_13]: I want to talk to you really fast so I have a chance.

515
00:32:01,193 --> 00:32:04,115
[SPEAKER_13]: Since we don't talk to new people on the show very often, I'll just put them on the spot.

516
00:32:04,135 --> 00:32:05,857
[SPEAKER_13]: I want to say hi to Tequila.

517
00:32:06,497 --> 00:32:06,837
[SPEAKER_13]: What's up?

518
00:32:07,338 --> 00:32:07,678
[SPEAKER_13]: What's up?

519
00:32:08,234 --> 00:32:08,734
[SPEAKER_13]: How are you doing?

520
00:32:08,754 --> 00:32:09,514
[SPEAKER_13]: Where are you from, Tequila?

521
00:32:09,734 --> 00:32:11,035
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm from Omaha, and how are you?

522
00:32:11,415 --> 00:32:11,915
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm pretty good.

523
00:32:11,935 --> 00:32:14,036
[SPEAKER_13]: So you came all the way out here from Omaha to do this tournament?

524
00:32:14,316 --> 00:32:14,896
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, sir, I did.

525
00:32:15,136 --> 00:32:16,637
[SPEAKER_13]: What enticed you to get on that plane?

526
00:32:16,757 --> 00:32:19,077
[SPEAKER_13]: What was the factor that said, I've got to be at this tournament?

527
00:32:20,158 --> 00:32:21,498
[SPEAKER_20]: First prize.

528
00:32:21,558 --> 00:32:22,399
[SPEAKER_20]: Max 2 machine.

529
00:32:22,419 --> 00:32:23,479
[SPEAKER_20]: That's a lot of money.

530
00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:29,501
[SPEAKER_13]: So, you know, without giving too much away, what kind of secrets you got in your freestyle routine that's going to make you walk home with that machine?

531
00:32:30,881 --> 00:32:32,182
[SPEAKER_20]: Two props for my first routine.

532
00:32:33,002 --> 00:32:34,442
[SPEAKER_20]: Two sexy props.

533
00:32:34,883 --> 00:32:36,163
[SPEAKER_20]: Most scandalous routine ever.

534
00:32:37,165 --> 00:32:37,625
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, Jamie?

535
00:32:37,806 --> 00:32:38,226
[SPEAKER_20]: One word.

536
00:32:38,786 --> 00:32:40,108
[SPEAKER_20]: Shades.

537
00:32:42,750 --> 00:32:43,491
[SPEAKER_14]: Big shades.

538
00:32:45,632 --> 00:32:47,234
[SPEAKER_03]: What have you, baby?

539
00:32:47,834 --> 00:32:48,915
[SPEAKER_13]: Definitely looking forward to seeing it.

540
00:32:48,995 --> 00:32:50,497
[SPEAKER_13]: Anything else you want to say to folks out there?

541
00:32:50,517 --> 00:32:52,258
[SPEAKER_13]: Anything about the tournament or what have you?

542
00:32:52,719 --> 00:32:54,080
[SPEAKER_20]: The videos will speak for themselves.

543
00:32:56,761 --> 00:32:58,582
[SPEAKER_13]: Let the videos speak for themselves.

544
00:32:59,263 --> 00:33:00,204
[SPEAKER_13]: More to come later.

545
00:33:00,424 --> 00:33:02,525
[SPEAKER_13]: I think we're going to have to interview you after that routine.

546
00:33:03,306 --> 00:33:03,927
[SPEAKER_13]: That's perfect.

547
00:33:04,067 --> 00:33:04,907
[SPEAKER_13]: All right, perfect.

548
00:33:05,588 --> 00:33:07,249
[SPEAKER_13]: Come find me because I'm a lazy bastard.

549
00:33:07,269 --> 00:33:08,430
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't tape much for the show.

550
00:33:08,530 --> 00:33:09,531
[SPEAKER_20]: I swear to God I will.

551
00:33:09,811 --> 00:33:10,452
[SPEAKER_20]: All right, great.

552
00:33:10,832 --> 00:33:15,356
[SPEAKER_20]: Videos won't truly get the whole feel of it.

553
00:33:15,656 --> 00:33:16,457
[SPEAKER_13]: I came to L.A.

554
00:33:16,477 --> 00:33:17,077
[SPEAKER_13]: just for this.

555
00:33:18,919 --> 00:33:20,460
[SPEAKER_13]: RTF domination, baby.

556
00:33:21,875 --> 00:33:22,556
[SPEAKER_13]: We shall see.

557
00:33:51,897 --> 00:33:55,738
[SPEAKER_13]: It was pretty hard, I guess.

558
00:33:55,758 --> 00:33:56,119
[SPEAKER_13]: Tiring?

559
00:33:56,359 --> 00:33:56,919
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, tiring.

560
00:33:57,839 --> 00:33:58,279
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

561
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:01,020
[SPEAKER_13]: The last match was kind of weird.

562
00:34:01,261 --> 00:34:02,721
[SPEAKER_13]: How many songs did you have to play in that last match?

563
00:34:03,021 --> 00:34:03,801
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know, I was keeping count.

564
00:34:04,702 --> 00:34:05,502
[SPEAKER_13]: What was the toughest one?

565
00:34:05,542 --> 00:34:06,362
[SPEAKER_13]: What was the toughest one for you?

566
00:34:07,283 --> 00:34:10,584
[SPEAKER_09]: It must have been Paranoia, because I think that's the song I really messed up on.

567
00:34:10,764 --> 00:34:11,384
[SPEAKER_09]: Paranoia, Survivor.

568
00:34:11,604 --> 00:34:13,125
[SPEAKER_13]: Or, Survivor, Eternal.

569
00:34:13,849 --> 00:34:15,970
[SPEAKER_13]: So, did you train for this at all?

570
00:34:16,110 --> 00:34:17,831
[SPEAKER_13]: Like, did you practice a lot?

571
00:34:17,951 --> 00:34:20,132
[SPEAKER_13]: How do you do to prepare yourself for something like this?

572
00:34:20,172 --> 00:34:23,033
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, I went to MGL every day, you know, for like two weeks.

573
00:34:23,413 --> 00:34:25,274
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, something like that, yeah.

574
00:34:25,354 --> 00:34:30,177
[SPEAKER_13]: You're pretty well known in NorCal, at least, for being the PA guy that seems to walk away on the first prize for all the tournaments.

575
00:34:30,197 --> 00:34:33,998
[SPEAKER_13]: So, did you do anything extra for this, being like it was going to be a big tournament?

576
00:34:34,118 --> 00:34:36,199
[SPEAKER_13]: What do you mean, like, do anything?

577
00:34:36,379 --> 00:34:37,760
[SPEAKER_13]: Was there any, like, extra preparation?

578
00:34:37,780 --> 00:34:42,082
[SPEAKER_13]: Like, was it extra... Were you extra nervous for this one, or... Oh, yeah, I was...

579
00:34:43,163 --> 00:34:44,864
[SPEAKER_13]: Was it just another day for Jigger?

580
00:34:44,904 --> 00:34:45,824
[SPEAKER_07]: No, it wasn't another day.

581
00:34:45,904 --> 00:34:46,425
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

582
00:34:46,445 --> 00:34:47,065
[SPEAKER_07]: I was getting kind of worried.

583
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:49,066
[SPEAKER_13]: I saw really good PAs and stuff.

584
00:34:50,387 --> 00:34:53,049
[SPEAKER_13]: That whole training every day thing, that was like, whoa, it's crazy.

585
00:34:53,549 --> 00:34:55,150
[SPEAKER_13]: Any future tournaments you plan on attending?

586
00:34:56,231 --> 00:34:58,172
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know of any coming up.

587
00:34:58,232 --> 00:34:59,012
[SPEAKER_13]: Except for one in Seattle.

588
00:34:59,052 --> 00:35:00,473
[SPEAKER_13]: I think my dad's taking me or something.

589
00:35:01,154 --> 00:35:02,714
[SPEAKER_13]: Now, I know your dad comes with you to all the tournaments.

590
00:35:02,734 --> 00:35:03,775
[SPEAKER_13]: That's pretty cool.

591
00:35:03,795 --> 00:35:04,435
[SPEAKER_13]: A lot of support.

592
00:35:04,455 --> 00:35:06,337
[SPEAKER_13]: Do you get a lot of support from your parents?

593
00:35:06,477 --> 00:35:06,697
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

594
00:35:07,116 --> 00:35:07,496
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

595
00:35:07,957 --> 00:35:10,198
That's good.

596
00:35:10,599 --> 00:35:12,540
[SPEAKER_13]: They don't stand there and punish you if you do bad, do you?

597
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:13,921
[SPEAKER_07]: No, no, no, no, no.

598
00:35:14,341 --> 00:35:15,022
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm just joking around.

599
00:35:15,042 --> 00:35:15,823
[SPEAKER_13]: Of course not, of course not.

600
00:35:15,843 --> 00:35:17,684
[SPEAKER_13]: But that's awesome that they show up and there's work.

601
00:35:17,884 --> 00:35:19,746
[SPEAKER_13]: Do you ever watch the tapes?

602
00:35:21,046 --> 00:35:21,467
[SPEAKER_13]: What tapes?

603
00:35:21,827 --> 00:35:22,948
[SPEAKER_13]: Because I know I see tapes sometimes.

604
00:35:22,988 --> 00:35:23,268
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know.

605
00:35:23,648 --> 00:35:24,209
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, yeah, yeah.

606
00:35:24,449 --> 00:35:26,991
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's cool because people actually ask me for copies and stuff sometimes.

607
00:35:27,351 --> 00:35:28,452
[SPEAKER_13]: Because nobody ever tapes PA.

608
00:35:28,472 --> 00:35:29,313
[SPEAKER_13]: It's like PA ain't important.

609
00:35:29,333 --> 00:35:30,193
[SPEAKER_13]: Nobody wants to tape that stuff.

610
00:35:30,233 --> 00:35:31,054
[SPEAKER_13]: But your dad does.

611
00:35:31,114 --> 00:35:31,454
[SPEAKER_13]: That's cool.

612
00:35:32,775 --> 00:35:33,596
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

613
00:35:33,656 --> 00:35:34,757
[SPEAKER_13]: PA is not important?

614
00:35:34,777 --> 00:35:35,077
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

615
00:35:35,421 --> 00:35:36,201
[SPEAKER_13]: What you mean by that, man?

616
00:35:37,202 --> 00:35:40,483
[SPEAKER_13]: No, I mean, but you know, like, if you get on the internet, there's all the freestyle videos, there's no PA videos.

617
00:35:40,743 --> 00:35:43,124
[SPEAKER_13]: Hey, I'm a PA-er myself, except I was too lazy for this one.

618
00:35:43,384 --> 00:35:43,644
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

619
00:35:45,105 --> 00:35:45,925
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

620
00:35:46,766 --> 00:35:48,286
[SPEAKER_13]: So anything else you want to say about the tournament?

621
00:35:48,706 --> 00:35:49,427
[SPEAKER_13]: Thoughts for the day?

622
00:35:49,447 --> 00:35:53,108
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know, it was cool, because, like, the Markov people were, like, keeping me motivated.

623
00:35:53,328 --> 00:35:57,410
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, my girlfriend, and, like, um... Wendell, yeah, Wendell.

624
00:35:57,470 --> 00:35:57,830
[SPEAKER_07]: Wendell.

625
00:35:58,650 --> 00:35:59,791
[SPEAKER_07]: And, um, Mike, no...

626
00:36:00,692 --> 00:36:01,953
[SPEAKER_07]: and, yeah, just a number of people.

627
00:36:02,314 --> 00:36:03,134
[SPEAKER_13]: Good people in DDR.

628
00:36:03,154 --> 00:36:03,335
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

629
00:36:03,555 --> 00:36:05,336
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, congratulations once again.

630
00:36:05,417 --> 00:36:05,777
[SPEAKER_13]: Good job.

631
00:36:05,797 --> 00:36:06,878
[SPEAKER_13]: What are you going to do with the controller?

632
00:36:08,299 --> 00:36:09,000
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, use it.

633
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:10,201
[SPEAKER_06]: Where are you going to sell it?

634
00:36:10,241 --> 00:36:10,741
[SPEAKER_13]: Good answer.

635
00:36:10,761 --> 00:36:12,823
[SPEAKER_13]: You're not going to sell it?

636
00:36:13,604 --> 00:36:14,205
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, I don't know.

637
00:36:14,385 --> 00:36:14,825
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe.

638
00:36:14,945 --> 00:36:16,226
[SPEAKER_13]: I heard different stories about the controller, too.

639
00:36:16,727 --> 00:36:20,170
[SPEAKER_13]: Like, it's worth $400, and then I heard it was worth $800, then $400 again.

640
00:36:20,330 --> 00:36:22,292
[SPEAKER_13]: They're pretty hard to get a hold of now, so good luck.

641
00:36:23,385 --> 00:36:23,565
[SPEAKER_13]: BOO NER

642
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:46,861
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I5?

643
00:37:09,154 --> 00:37:09,634
[SPEAKER_01]: I-5, alright?

644
00:37:09,674 --> 00:37:10,775
[SPEAKER_01]: The cops on I-5.

645
00:37:10,875 --> 00:37:12,096
[SPEAKER_13]: It's internet radio, you can say whatever you want.

646
00:37:12,256 --> 00:37:13,156
[SPEAKER_01]: Fuck the cops, alright?

647
00:37:13,176 --> 00:37:16,779
[SPEAKER_01]: Because, man, I swear to God, if they do that shit again, I just will bust their asses, man.

648
00:37:16,859 --> 00:37:17,179
[SPEAKER_01]: What happened?

649
00:37:17,199 --> 00:37:17,699
[SPEAKER_01]: You got pulled over?

650
00:37:17,859 --> 00:37:19,600
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my God, dude, we're fucking driving, right?

651
00:37:19,660 --> 00:37:21,181
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone else is going the same speed and shit.

652
00:37:21,222 --> 00:37:22,342
[SPEAKER_01]: And what does this fucking cop do?

653
00:37:23,423 --> 00:37:24,884
[SPEAKER_01]: You know you're going too fast?

654
00:37:25,024 --> 00:37:26,205
[SPEAKER_01]: What about your family?

655
00:37:26,285 --> 00:37:27,005
[SPEAKER_01]: Bitch, we're friends.

656
00:37:27,245 --> 00:37:28,206
[SPEAKER_01]: We know what the fuck we're doing.

657
00:37:28,626 --> 00:37:29,707
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like, fuck you, cops.

658
00:37:29,887 --> 00:37:31,148
[SPEAKER_01]: Fuck you, Highway Patrol.

659
00:37:31,428 --> 00:37:31,868
[SPEAKER_01]: You hear that?

660
00:37:31,889 --> 00:37:35,311
[SPEAKER_01]: You give me one more motherfucking ticket, and I'm gonna go like Jahi on your asses, alright?

661
00:37:35,891 --> 00:37:38,654
[SPEAKER_13]: It's the nephew of the week, straight from Bob Lombardi, how about that?

662
00:37:40,015 --> 00:37:45,440
[SPEAKER_13]: So, I notice a lot of freestyles around here, they're kind of nervous, competition's a little tight, what are your thoughts going into freestyle?

663
00:37:45,580 --> 00:37:53,728
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what, when I first came down here, I didn't give a fuck about freestyle, you know, because I figured I would just go up there, you know, improv something like I usually do, you know?

664
00:37:54,975 --> 00:38:08,776
[SPEAKER_01]: But then I started talking, you know, like, I mean, people like Wendell, you know, like Hypnotix, or Go, excuse me, you know, people like Bruce Leroy, Mel B, you know, and it's like, you know, they're taking it hella seriously and stuff, and it's like...

665
00:38:09,369 --> 00:38:10,090
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

666
00:38:31,585 --> 00:38:34,126
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you can't put it on a job application, okay?

667
00:38:34,366 --> 00:38:37,166
[SPEAKER_01]: Man, I was number one, you know, at this Southern California tournament.

668
00:38:37,526 --> 00:38:38,626
[SPEAKER_01]: People were cleasing my toes.

669
00:38:38,646 --> 00:38:39,366
[SPEAKER_01]: They'd be like, so?

670
00:38:39,727 --> 00:38:41,947
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe if you're auditioning for Broadway, like Chicago.

671
00:38:42,247 --> 00:38:42,927
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there you go.

672
00:38:42,987 --> 00:38:43,787
[SPEAKER_01]: That is a good point.

673
00:38:43,827 --> 00:38:44,968
[SPEAKER_01]: That is a very good point.

674
00:38:45,188 --> 00:38:47,828
[SPEAKER_01]: However, you know, I'm, once again, I'm going to go up there.

675
00:38:48,028 --> 00:38:48,868
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to do my thing.

676
00:38:49,348 --> 00:38:51,169
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if I make it to tomorrow, that's excellent.

677
00:38:51,229 --> 00:38:54,809
[SPEAKER_01]: If I don't, I still came down here to kick with my friends, you know, represent North Carolina to the fullest.

678
00:38:54,949 --> 00:38:55,930
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome attitude to have.

679
00:38:56,650 --> 00:38:58,390
[SPEAKER_13]: Everybody should be like Bob Lombardi, ladies and gentlemen.

680
00:38:59,603 --> 00:39:00,663
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody!

681
00:39:01,504 --> 00:39:02,784
[SPEAKER_04]: Arirarira!

682
00:39:03,724 --> 00:39:06,085
[SPEAKER_23]: Yay!

683
00:39:06,966 --> 00:39:09,446
[SPEAKER_13]: Any other thoughts you have for the folks at home listening?

684
00:39:10,647 --> 00:39:14,788
[SPEAKER_01]: If you see a police officer drive by after he passes you, flip his ass off.

685
00:39:15,889 --> 00:39:16,629
[SPEAKER_01]: Fuck the police!

686
00:39:17,929 --> 00:39:18,810
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, can we get a little rap?

687
00:39:21,871 --> 00:39:22,131
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright.

688
00:39:22,911 --> 00:39:25,032
[SPEAKER_13]: So, Mel's back over here too.

689
00:39:25,052 --> 00:39:25,972
[SPEAKER_13]: What do you think about PA, Mel?

690
00:39:27,430 --> 00:39:30,012
[SPEAKER_16]: It was, well... He intends!

691
00:39:30,372 --> 00:39:31,473
[SPEAKER_16]: That's Wendell's catchphrase.

692
00:39:31,693 --> 00:39:33,935
[SPEAKER_16]: Hey, sure beats sticking around, but I digress.

693
00:39:34,415 --> 00:39:39,299
[SPEAKER_16]: PA, man, it's... I mean, I can't honestly say that I was surprised.

694
00:39:39,399 --> 00:39:44,282
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, I pretty much... It was Tigger, and it was pretty much his tourney to lose.

695
00:39:44,763 --> 00:39:49,666
[SPEAKER_16]: But, you know, it's like, I mean, people did show up, and, like, the thing between JSP, though, it was, like, endless love.

696
00:39:49,987 --> 00:39:51,748
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, it was like if frickin'...

697
00:39:52,509 --> 00:39:57,291
[SPEAKER_16]: If Stevie Wonder and, like, someone else blind had to play tennis, it was like endless love, man.

698
00:39:57,311 --> 00:39:58,572
[SPEAKER_16]: It was like back and forth, back and forth.

699
00:39:58,852 --> 00:40:02,773
[SPEAKER_16]: Nothing was happening, then this guy slammed the door like a closer, and props to him, man.

700
00:40:03,133 --> 00:40:04,254
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, it's kind of funny that...

701
00:40:05,552 --> 00:40:08,674
[SPEAKER_11]: Mel, by the way, did a whole bag of crack for this interview.

702
00:40:08,774 --> 00:40:09,535
[SPEAKER_13]: No, I'm just kidding.

703
00:40:10,616 --> 00:40:12,757
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm trying to think of where this reference leads to.

704
00:40:13,398 --> 00:40:15,519
[SPEAKER_13]: I was following it that day.

705
00:40:15,559 --> 00:40:22,144
[SPEAKER_13]: There must have been something in the smog because I was totally following him that day and right now I'm listening to this going, I have no idea what you're talking about, Mel.

706
00:40:22,904 --> 00:40:23,545
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, that's okay.

707
00:40:23,985 --> 00:40:24,786
[SPEAKER_13]: He forgives me, I hope.

708
00:40:25,186 --> 00:40:32,016
[SPEAKER_16]: He went to turn and he don't play a damn game of 2DX, but I'm sure someone on eBay or someone else is gonna make his pockets a little fatter, so props to him.

709
00:40:32,436 --> 00:40:32,817
[SPEAKER_13]: Props to him.

710
00:40:33,097 --> 00:40:37,403
[SPEAKER_13]: So now you're gonna tell us any, like, surprises we can look forward to your routine, like digging your mouth?

711
00:40:39,246 --> 00:40:39,947
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, damn.

712
00:40:39,967 --> 00:40:40,628
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, well...

713
00:40:41,417 --> 00:40:42,618
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know about surprises.

714
00:40:42,838 --> 00:40:45,040
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, it's just, there'll be new moves, that's for sure.

715
00:40:45,340 --> 00:40:51,506
[SPEAKER_16]: New moves I don't thought, I mean, people think they saw my Let's Talk It Over from Miggle 2, but this one's going to be a complete 180 remix.

716
00:40:51,526 --> 00:40:52,787
[SPEAKER_16]: It's going to look pretty tight.

717
00:40:53,347 --> 00:40:57,711
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm just thinking, yeah, it's going to be enough to be a pretty high qualifier.

718
00:40:57,931 --> 00:41:00,133
[SPEAKER_16]: Then tomorrow, like I said, it's Overdrive.

719
00:41:01,306 --> 00:41:02,788
[SPEAKER_13]: Did anyone whip out their cock?

720
00:41:21,845 --> 00:41:33,894
[SPEAKER_13]: The thing about CyberZone, the arcade where it was hosted, they have in the back karaoke booths where you can go and you sit in and sing karaoke songs for like 50 cents and it grades you on a scale of 0 to 100.

721
00:41:34,655 --> 00:41:39,258
[SPEAKER_13]: Irene and I probably sat in there like all day Saturday and played that game, so we missed.

722
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:41,420
[SPEAKER_13]: Thanks for watching!

723
00:41:57,699 --> 00:42:01,301
[SPEAKER_22]: I saw the picture, by the way, the karaoke machine, and the text on that one.

724
00:42:01,341 --> 00:42:02,462
[SPEAKER_22]: They brought one of those out.

725
00:42:03,542 --> 00:42:04,703
[SPEAKER_22]: They had, like, the portable one.

726
00:42:05,343 --> 00:42:15,369
[SPEAKER_22]: They brought one of those out at our meeting for Thanksgiving, our Thanksgiving dinner, and it grades you, like, a percentage based on how accurate you are with the music.

727
00:42:15,489 --> 00:42:16,370
[SPEAKER_22]: I want one of those.

728
00:42:16,890 --> 00:42:17,350
[SPEAKER_13]: Buy me.

729
00:42:18,791 --> 00:42:19,051
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay.

730
00:42:19,511 --> 00:42:20,212
[SPEAKER_13]: Look on eBay.

731
00:42:21,300 --> 00:42:23,081
[SPEAKER_13]: Evil Bay Didn't you just buy something big on eBay recently?

732
00:42:39,289 --> 00:42:46,952
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I bought two, well, they're Cypher Games, they're metal pads.

733
00:42:47,412 --> 00:42:49,393
[SPEAKER_10]: They normally would go for $200 a piece.

734
00:42:49,513 --> 00:42:50,434
[SPEAKER_10]: I bought two for $187.

735
00:42:50,474 --> 00:42:53,235
[SPEAKER_10]: Hmm, brand new.

736
00:42:54,195 --> 00:42:56,276
[SPEAKER_10]: I guess they were expecting it to go higher.

737
00:42:57,156 --> 00:43:05,380
[SPEAKER_10]: Also, personal message, I'm sure he's not listening, but to the person that goes by the name, aloha to you too, I beat your ass by $2.30.

738
00:43:05,460 --> 00:43:05,740
[SPEAKER_10]: So there.

739
00:43:09,401 --> 00:43:14,123
[SPEAKER_10]: The little fucker wanted to come and upbid me and thought, oh, I'm going to get the pads at the last minute.

740
00:43:14,143 --> 00:43:17,924
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I came in 30 seconds to close and threw up the bid of about another $2.

741
00:43:17,964 --> 00:43:21,385
[SPEAKER_22]: You don't want to know about my eBay exploits.

742
00:43:21,805 --> 00:43:22,125
[SPEAKER_22]: What'd you do?

743
00:43:22,145 --> 00:43:22,885
[SPEAKER_22]: It's not every bid I do.

744
00:43:22,905 --> 00:43:26,586
[SPEAKER_22]: If something that I didn't know was going to go for about $15, $20, 10 seconds before it's over, I bid $50.

745
00:43:31,107 --> 00:43:33,628
[SPEAKER_22]: I ended up getting this doujinshi for $30.

746
00:43:33,768 --> 00:43:35,409
[SPEAKER_22]: It was worth it.

747
00:43:35,449 --> 00:43:36,750
[SPEAKER_22]: It was a nice 70 page.

748
00:43:37,290 --> 00:43:37,770
[SPEAKER_22]: Really nice.

749
00:43:37,910 --> 00:43:39,091
[SPEAKER_22]: I bid $150 on it.

750
00:43:41,172 --> 00:43:42,473
[SPEAKER_22]: Because I knew nobody would top it.

751
00:43:43,673 --> 00:43:47,535
[SPEAKER_10]: See, the thing is when people do stuff like that to me, I know how much it's worth.

752
00:43:47,976 --> 00:43:49,637
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll bid up to about how much it's worth.

753
00:43:50,117 --> 00:43:54,919
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'll knock up the bid another $100 on something that's not worth that much.

754
00:43:57,641 --> 00:43:57,881
[SPEAKER_10]: Right on.

755
00:43:58,564 --> 00:44:00,225
[SPEAKER_13]: Fuck the police!

756
00:44:00,245 --> 00:44:01,025
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, do you feel not so fresh?

757
00:44:26,425 --> 00:44:27,707
[SPEAKER_21]: Do you need to be one with the questions?

758
00:44:27,727 --> 00:44:31,611
[SPEAKER_13]: Apparently, I constantly always have that not-so-fresh feeling, and I never knew why.

759
00:44:32,292 --> 00:44:32,873
[SPEAKER_21]: Now you do.

760
00:44:32,953 --> 00:44:33,574
[SPEAKER_13]: Now I do.

761
00:44:33,594 --> 00:44:35,236
[SPEAKER_21]: Now you know, and knowing is half the battle.

762
00:44:35,256 --> 00:44:36,557
[SPEAKER_13]: Thanks to my guardian angel.

763
00:44:39,821 --> 00:44:41,483
[SPEAKER_13]: I still think that's so funny.

764
00:44:41,763 --> 00:44:42,324
[SPEAKER_13]: It is funny.

765
00:44:42,644 --> 00:44:43,826
[SPEAKER_13]: All right, we'll be back.

766
00:46:08,727 --> 00:46:09,070
and so on.

767
00:47:22,685 --> 00:47:23,409
Thanks for watching!

768
00:48:24,865 --> 00:48:25,837
Thanks for watching!

769
00:50:09,517 --> 00:50:10,757
[SPEAKER_13]: Orange Lounge Radio.

770
00:50:11,098 --> 00:50:13,238
[SPEAKER_13]: We put your thing down, flip it and reverse it.

771
00:50:17,539 --> 00:50:22,601
[SPEAKER_13]: I guess you heard that in Target the other day or something, Jamie?

772
00:50:22,701 --> 00:50:24,761
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes, and I hate that type of music.

773
00:50:24,801 --> 00:50:25,722
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't consider that music.

774
00:50:27,262 --> 00:50:27,862
[SPEAKER_13]: You know what's funny?

775
00:50:27,882 --> 00:50:29,163
[SPEAKER_13]: They were playing that at the club last night.

776
00:50:29,183 --> 00:50:34,665
[SPEAKER_13]: I went out to the club, get my dance on, and they played like this whole set of like booty, like new wave booty.

777
00:50:34,725 --> 00:50:37,085
[SPEAKER_13]: Not the old stuff like you like, but the new wave booty music.

778
00:50:37,105 --> 00:50:43,167
[SPEAKER_13]: Like Lil' Kim, that song, and then that song that goes, my lips, my back, my pussy, and my track.

779
00:50:43,868 --> 00:50:47,189
[SPEAKER_22]: No, when Johnny was over, he found that song and played it for us.

780
00:50:47,809 --> 00:50:49,590
[SPEAKER_22]: And we were like going, turn that off.

781
00:50:49,650 --> 00:50:50,610
[SPEAKER_22]: Melody made him turn it off.

782
00:50:52,389 --> 00:50:53,050
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

783
00:51:09,093 --> 00:51:09,834
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyway, yeah, hi.

784
00:51:10,494 --> 00:51:11,915
[SPEAKER_13]: You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

785
00:51:11,935 --> 00:51:15,958
[SPEAKER_13]: We occasionally talk about Bomani on this show when there's nothing better to talk about.

786
00:51:16,678 --> 00:51:17,338
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, yes, Zero.

787
00:51:17,398 --> 00:51:21,221
[SPEAKER_07]: I heard two little, like, 12-year-old girls singing that song on the bus today.

788
00:51:22,021 --> 00:51:23,082
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not even joking.

789
00:51:23,102 --> 00:51:24,903
[SPEAKER_07]: They're standing there on the bus doing it.

790
00:51:24,943 --> 00:51:27,605
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm like, they know this by heart.

791
00:51:27,625 --> 00:51:30,127
[SPEAKER_07]: They must have listened to it like 100 times just before they got on the bus.

792
00:51:30,227 --> 00:51:32,208
[SPEAKER_07]: It was sad and scary all at the same time.

793
00:51:32,448 --> 00:51:33,869
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what it was when I was a kid?

794
00:51:33,929 --> 00:51:35,330
[SPEAKER_21]: Remember, you too can prevent skanks.

795
00:51:35,370 --> 00:51:35,830
[SPEAKER_21]: Skanks.

796
00:51:37,211 --> 00:51:52,439
[SPEAKER_13]: You know what, I think I might actually have this, but... You know, when I was young, it was all about this, like, this was the song that really pissed my parents off.

797
00:51:52,499 --> 00:51:53,940
[SPEAKER_13]: This song really pissed my parents off.

798
00:51:56,221 --> 00:51:57,361
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know if you guys know this song.

799
00:52:01,683 --> 00:52:02,544
[SPEAKER_13]: I have to find the part of it.

800
00:52:11,724 --> 00:52:15,827
[SPEAKER_17]: Do you realize that people are still having sex?

801
00:52:15,867 --> 00:52:17,529
[SPEAKER_17]: They've been told not to.

802
00:52:17,729 --> 00:52:19,750
[SPEAKER_17]: Perhaps they are perplexed.

803
00:52:19,770 --> 00:52:23,894
[SPEAKER_17]: When you see them, they're making future plans to engage.

804
00:52:24,394 --> 00:52:32,801
[SPEAKER_22]: Speaking of bad remixes, I downloaded Slim Shady and the background music was Billie Jean.

805
00:52:34,368 --> 00:52:35,409
[SPEAKER_13]: I got a really bad one.

806
00:52:35,429 --> 00:52:36,809
[SPEAKER_13]: No, this is fucking horrible.

807
00:52:37,069 --> 00:52:37,550
[SPEAKER_13]: Listen to this.

808
00:52:37,870 --> 00:52:38,950
[SPEAKER_13]: I just downloaded this the other day.

809
00:52:38,990 --> 00:52:40,971
[SPEAKER_13]: This is the most fucking horrible thing I've ever heard in my life.

810
00:52:40,991 --> 00:52:41,592
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll bring it next week.

811
00:52:41,772 --> 00:52:42,012
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

812
00:52:42,032 --> 00:52:46,494
[SPEAKER_13]: We're going to have to have like a, some kind of, maybe like a pre-show or sometime on the station we have to play.

813
00:52:46,534 --> 00:52:47,494
[SPEAKER_09]: Worst remix ever.

814
00:52:47,534 --> 00:52:49,495
[SPEAKER_13]: Really, really bad remixes.

815
00:52:49,515 --> 00:52:53,137
[SPEAKER_09]: Nothing beats the Splat Attack William Shatner Techno Mixes.

816
00:52:53,417 --> 00:52:55,918
[SPEAKER_09]: Those are the most god-awful things you'll ever hear.

817
00:52:56,298 --> 00:52:58,479
[SPEAKER_09]: The music's bad and the samples are worse.

818
00:52:59,200 --> 00:52:59,880
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just awful.

819
00:53:00,532 --> 00:53:00,932
[SPEAKER_13]: Listen to this.

820
00:53:00,952 --> 00:53:03,214
[SPEAKER_13]: You might recognize this song from 2DX6 style.

821
00:53:03,274 --> 00:53:04,695
[SPEAKER_13]: Listen to how they rape this song.

822
00:53:26,011 --> 00:53:27,732
[SPEAKER_22]: They're two different fucking keys!

823
00:53:29,133 --> 00:53:29,514
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay?

824
00:53:31,204 --> 00:53:34,605
[SPEAKER_22]: That was torture because, okay, I have a perfect sense of pitch.

825
00:53:35,446 --> 00:53:36,006
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm a man.

826
00:53:36,626 --> 00:53:38,987
[SPEAKER_22]: I used to elbow people when their horns were out of tune.

827
00:53:39,007 --> 00:53:40,367
[SPEAKER_22]: Go, okay, you're out of tune.

828
00:53:41,848 --> 00:53:46,389
[SPEAKER_22]: And that, the dissonance in that was enough to make heads explode like in scanners.

829
00:53:47,650 --> 00:53:47,890
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay?

830
00:53:49,252 --> 00:53:52,035
[SPEAKER_11]: The very first thing the chatroom goes, is that a twin mix?

831
00:53:53,576 --> 00:53:54,317
[SPEAKER_22]: Chatroom, I love you.

832
00:53:55,078 --> 00:53:59,902
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, I mean, like, who decided to mix Vincent Damore and Whitney Houston?

833
00:53:59,942 --> 00:54:00,723
[SPEAKER_11]: That's what I want to know.

834
00:54:01,183 --> 00:54:05,047
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, the worst thing I heard lately was that Max 300 jump.

835
00:54:05,227 --> 00:54:08,590
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know who did it, but it's like, it's the 7 jump with Max 300.

836
00:54:09,571 --> 00:54:11,613
[SPEAKER_09]: They just laid them on top of each other and played them at the same time.

837
00:54:11,806 --> 00:54:28,021
[SPEAKER_10]: The worst one is this Mario, what was it, Mario Max, and, and, and, and, I, I keep, you know, people are like, people, I swear to God, there's people doing talkbacks, and like, they say, so why can't there, anyone make any good remixes of Max 300, like Mario Max, and, and then someone, Mar, what?

838
00:54:30,003 --> 00:54:36,429
[SPEAKER_09]: It's awful, awful shit, don't mix anything from 4th Mix with Max 300, it's just wrong.

839
00:54:36,889 --> 00:54:38,511
[SPEAKER_09]: No, it was just horrible anyway.

840
00:54:38,751 --> 00:54:43,976
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like, they'd cut, they'd stop Max, play some Mario, cut Mario, play some Max.

841
00:54:49,681 --> 00:54:49,801
[SPEAKER_22]: Ew.

842
00:54:51,162 --> 00:54:54,686
[SPEAKER_22]: No, first of all, Whitney Houston needs to have her larynx pulled out.

843
00:54:55,538 --> 00:54:57,119
[SPEAKER_22]: so that we never have to hear from her again.

844
00:54:57,400 --> 00:54:58,481
[SPEAKER_10]: And tell her to stop acting.

845
00:54:58,501 --> 00:54:59,341
[SPEAKER_10]: I hated that fucking movie.

846
00:54:59,361 --> 00:55:00,202
[SPEAKER_10]: My girlfriend made me watch it last night.

847
00:55:00,222 --> 00:55:00,602
[SPEAKER_10]: Freaking Bodyguard.

848
00:55:00,622 --> 00:55:01,383
[SPEAKER_10]: The whole movie was about her bitching.

849
00:55:01,403 --> 00:55:24,422
[SPEAKER_22]: Bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch

850
00:55:25,089 --> 00:55:31,736
[SPEAKER_22]: But no, and you know, Whitney Houston takes this credit for I Will Always Love You, that song.

851
00:55:32,096 --> 00:55:32,957
[SPEAKER_22]: She fucked up that song.

852
00:55:33,077 --> 00:55:34,158
[SPEAKER_13]: Fuck you, Whitney Houston.

853
00:55:34,178 --> 00:55:35,519
[SPEAKER_13]: That is all about Dolly Parton.

854
00:55:35,740 --> 00:55:37,361
[SPEAKER_22]: Shit, Dolly Parton cried during that.

855
00:55:37,421 --> 00:55:39,223
[SPEAKER_13]: Dolly Parton cries in the middle of it.

856
00:55:39,643 --> 00:55:40,144
[SPEAKER_13]: I agree.

857
00:55:40,764 --> 00:55:42,126
[SPEAKER_13]: There is no other version of that song.

858
00:55:42,146 --> 00:55:42,947
[SPEAKER_22]: Whitney Houston needs to die.

859
00:55:42,987 --> 00:55:43,387
[SPEAKER_22]: Bobby Brown.

860
00:55:43,387 --> 00:55:43,967
[SPEAKER_22]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

861
00:56:08,453 --> 00:56:09,294
[SPEAKER_20]: It's South Sacramento.

862
00:56:10,454 --> 00:56:12,255
[SPEAKER_13]: Two good versions of I Will Always Love You.

863
00:56:12,876 --> 00:56:16,718
[SPEAKER_13]: Dolly Parton version and the version the girl belts out in the window in Hedwig.

864
00:56:17,058 --> 00:56:17,479
[SPEAKER_13]: That's it.

865
00:56:17,979 --> 00:56:19,380
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes, that is the best.

866
00:56:21,021 --> 00:56:22,602
[SPEAKER_22]: The one done with the thick country accent.

867
00:56:22,782 --> 00:56:25,884
[SPEAKER_13]: That was one of the highlights of my LA trip, by the way, was getting to see Hedwig on stage.

868
00:56:26,044 --> 00:56:27,005
[SPEAKER_13]: We're taking you next time.

869
00:56:27,645 --> 00:56:28,426
[SPEAKER_13]: Irene and I want to go back.

870
00:56:28,446 --> 00:56:29,306
[SPEAKER_13]: Why isn't Irene here tonight?

871
00:56:29,326 --> 00:56:30,127
[SPEAKER_13]: She promised me she'd be here.

872
00:56:30,667 --> 00:56:31,908
[SPEAKER_13]: Irene, if you're listening, you suck.

873
00:56:33,129 --> 00:56:33,889
[SPEAKER_13]: Gum hella sucks.

874
00:56:35,210 --> 00:56:36,791
[SPEAKER_22]: Hey, we have shrimp chips and you're missing out.

875
00:56:37,318 --> 00:56:40,679
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, I have that CD that Brad wanted with all the Death Race songs on it.

876
00:56:44,760 --> 00:56:45,200
[SPEAKER_13]: Death Race?

877
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:46,341
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, Death Race.

878
00:56:46,441 --> 00:56:46,681
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyway.

879
00:56:47,201 --> 00:56:47,421
[SPEAKER_13]: Hi.

880
00:56:49,381 --> 00:56:52,102
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, now that we've talked about horrible remixes, you want to get to the FUs of the Week?

881
00:56:52,702 --> 00:56:52,982
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

882
00:56:53,302 --> 00:56:53,683
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright.

883
00:56:55,043 --> 00:57:03,405
[SPEAKER_13]: Since we might have some new people listening in tonight, because we have the cyberbeat stuff, some people wanting to tune in to hear that, tell the folks what the FUs of the Week are all about.

884
00:57:03,945 --> 00:57:05,946
[SPEAKER_22]: We pick stuff that we hate and bitch about it.

885
00:57:07,719 --> 00:57:08,359
[SPEAKER_22]: That's about it.

886
00:57:08,499 --> 00:57:09,099
This is fucked up!

887
00:57:09,159 --> 00:57:09,579
I love that thing.

888
00:57:09,659 --> 00:57:13,940
Um, my threshold today goes toward, um... Well, okay, last night, it was, uh, me and Tina and her sister-in-law.

889
00:57:14,081 --> 00:57:18,962
[SPEAKER_22]: We're all coming back from, uh, the Rocky cast meeting.

890
00:57:19,042 --> 00:57:22,502
[SPEAKER_22]: And we were gonna, um, we went to an interview, we were gonna...

891
00:57:34,940 --> 00:57:38,143
[SPEAKER_13]: Now that was a surprise to me, reading that you went back there.

892
00:57:39,585 --> 00:57:39,845
[SPEAKER_22]: What?

893
00:57:40,045 --> 00:57:40,466
[SPEAKER_13]: Letterbees.

894
00:57:40,566 --> 00:57:42,428
[SPEAKER_22]: I went to the good letterbees, I didn't go to the ass letterbees.

895
00:57:42,668 --> 00:57:43,209
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, okay, okay.

896
00:57:43,229 --> 00:57:46,112
[SPEAKER_22]: Who, by the way, fucked them for not sending me my free ice cream coupon yet.

897
00:57:46,192 --> 00:57:51,277
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm gonna call and, like, call their district manager and bitch them out.

898
00:57:51,377 --> 00:57:52,839
[SPEAKER_22]: Because I want my free ice cream, goddammit.

899
00:57:52,919 --> 00:57:53,179
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyway.

900
00:57:53,259 --> 00:57:54,721
[SPEAKER_13]: I know somebody who works there already.

901
00:57:54,741 --> 00:57:55,502
[SPEAKER_13]: But anyway, we'll go.

902
00:57:57,003 --> 00:57:58,284
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, we got a good burp.

903
00:57:58,884 --> 00:58:01,266
[SPEAKER_22]: That burp is dedicated to the leather beans at Antelope.

904
00:58:03,207 --> 00:58:09,532
[SPEAKER_22]: And also, this one was brought to you not by Propel, it was brought to you by Martinelli's Cranberry Apple Sparking Cider.

905
00:58:11,693 --> 00:58:25,003
[SPEAKER_22]: Anyway, this guy in the truck, as we're leaving the guy to bond in on our great search for Jahi, this truck was like, not telling me, so you know what I did?

906
00:58:25,483 --> 00:58:26,104
[SPEAKER_22]: You know what I did?

907
00:58:27,629 --> 00:58:34,274
[SPEAKER_22]: I drove down to five miles an hour, and he couldn't pass me because there were cars coming.

908
00:58:35,074 --> 00:58:43,940
[SPEAKER_22]: So I went as slow as I could, and then I saw him about to duck over to turn, so I cut right in front of him and turned, right on to Madison.

909
00:58:44,640 --> 00:58:46,261
[SPEAKER_22]: And I went another five miles an hour.

910
00:58:46,722 --> 00:58:48,043
[SPEAKER_22]: He went to pass me, I cut him off.

911
00:58:48,923 --> 00:58:50,264
[SPEAKER_22]: He went to pass me, I cut him off.

912
00:58:51,685 --> 00:58:56,128
[SPEAKER_22]: And then I drove off into the sunset or a road, actually it was three in the morning or something like that.

913
00:58:57,771 --> 00:59:21,453
[SPEAKER_22]: into the darkness, into the dark black forest that's more appropriate for you, you drove off into the darkness from whence you came I was hoping that he would have drove past me so I could wave at him I love pissing off people when there's no traffic actually it's more like more than one ah, so you're the bitch he brought it on himself because he tailgated me, so fuck him yeah I'd also like to say um

914
00:59:24,588 --> 00:59:24,968
[SPEAKER_22]: You know what?

915
00:59:25,048 --> 00:59:27,149
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm really not that angsty about anything else.

916
00:59:27,769 --> 00:59:34,291
[SPEAKER_22]: There was this, like, scary person, though, that was at the virtual tour.

917
00:59:34,311 --> 00:59:34,991
[SPEAKER_22]: She was nice.

918
00:59:36,132 --> 00:59:37,832
[SPEAKER_22]: She was scary and wanted to talk to me.

919
00:59:38,392 --> 00:59:39,753
[SPEAKER_22]: It was definite Dawn Syndrome.

920
00:59:40,893 --> 00:59:45,214
[SPEAKER_22]: But I don't think anyone would get that unless they listened to 98 Rock right here.

921
00:59:45,594 --> 00:59:47,115
[SPEAKER_22]: You know what I'm talking about.

922
00:59:49,212 --> 00:59:51,557
[SPEAKER_10]: Disorderly and worthless nonsense.

923
00:59:51,798 --> 00:59:55,806
[SPEAKER_10]: It's basically when people come up to you and start idle conversations about nothing.

924
00:59:55,866 --> 00:59:58,231
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, say, for instance, you're standing in line.

925
01:00:00,799 --> 01:00:18,128
[SPEAKER_07]: I used to work there, like, I would do my internship in the morning when they were on air, and they would start doing that around the station, not even on their show, they would just start walking around doing it for no reason.

926
01:00:18,608 --> 01:00:19,629
[SPEAKER_07]: It was actually pretty funny.

927
01:00:20,229 --> 01:00:21,850
[SPEAKER_07]: But, yeah.

928
01:00:22,130 --> 01:00:23,071
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, we do that anyway.

929
01:00:23,091 --> 01:00:23,231
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, um...

930
01:00:27,774 --> 01:00:40,170
[SPEAKER_22]: I need to retract my FE to my CD player because now that I rigged it ghetto-style with paper, my faceplate stays on, although I can't turn down the volume or go back to listen to the track again.

931
01:00:40,330 --> 01:00:40,991
[SPEAKER_13]: Hooray, ghetto!

932
01:00:46,758 --> 01:00:50,539
[SPEAKER_22]: Another episode of the week goes toward the snack machine at my work.

933
01:00:51,339 --> 01:00:56,241
[SPEAKER_22]: Because in the morning, if I forget to eat my breakfast, the only thing that I have to eat is a NutriBrain bar out of the snack machine.

934
01:00:56,621 --> 01:00:57,981
[SPEAKER_22]: Our snack machine doesn't take dollars.

935
01:00:59,162 --> 01:01:02,743
[SPEAKER_22]: Or if it takes the dollar, it tells you to use correct change.

936
01:01:03,763 --> 01:01:05,644
[SPEAKER_22]: It also doesn't take nickels, dimes, or quarters.

937
01:01:06,344 --> 01:01:08,225
[SPEAKER_22]: So basically all that stuff.

938
01:01:08,245 --> 01:01:09,825
[SPEAKER_22]: And then it goes, ha, I can't get it.

939
01:01:09,845 --> 01:01:13,366
[SPEAKER_22]: It doesn't take a piece of pizza either.

940
01:01:13,406 --> 01:01:13,626
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, gosh.

941
01:01:18,018 --> 01:01:18,959
[SPEAKER_22]: Not too angsty this week.

942
01:01:44,935 --> 01:01:45,516
[SPEAKER_10]: No!

943
01:01:45,876 --> 01:01:47,857
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know, I've been just tired, so... No!

944
01:01:50,179 --> 01:01:53,742
[SPEAKER_10]: Tired not getting out because I'm trying to save money, so I'm not angsty.

945
01:01:54,523 --> 01:01:56,465
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, let's see here.

946
01:01:57,265 --> 01:01:59,727
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, F you to the stupid bitch at, uh, release.

947
01:02:00,148 --> 01:02:03,971
[SPEAKER_10]: Listen, you stupid whore, um, I don't want your fucking sample.

948
01:02:04,191 --> 01:02:06,393
[SPEAKER_10]: I've said it to you before, and I said it to you again.

949
01:02:06,653 --> 01:02:07,874
[SPEAKER_10]: Stop trying to give me the damn sample.

950
01:02:08,274 --> 01:02:09,636
[SPEAKER_22]: Can she be a whore, really?

951
01:02:09,736 --> 01:02:10,616
[SPEAKER_22]: Who would pay for her?

952
01:02:11,537 --> 01:02:28,226
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know if she's ugly, but anyways, yeah, she tried giving a sample to my friend, and it was like some taking rib on a stick, and she dropped the fucking thing down, down, slid down a little, you know, little cover there, it's like, and then like fell into like a basket full of chips or something like that.

953
01:02:28,906 --> 01:02:30,548
[SPEAKER_23]: and say, oh, let me give you another one!

954
01:02:30,988 --> 01:02:32,249
[SPEAKER_10]: He's like, no, that's fine.

955
01:02:32,990 --> 01:02:35,272
[SPEAKER_10]: But anyways, yeah, so F you to her because she's stupid.

956
01:02:35,773 --> 01:02:43,741
[SPEAKER_10]: And F you to pretty much everybody I talk to during the day at my work, except for my friend Andy, because you're all retarded and...

957
01:02:44,961 --> 01:02:45,902
[SPEAKER_10]: My god, I swear.

958
01:02:46,082 --> 01:02:51,743
[SPEAKER_10]: I think I may have mentioned this last week, but there was this... I had a big cup of hot chocolate.

959
01:02:51,943 --> 01:02:58,045
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, I'm walking about six inches away from a rail that's up on the third floor balcony area where I work.

960
01:02:58,765 --> 01:02:59,905
[SPEAKER_10]: So what do the people try to do?

961
01:02:59,925 --> 01:03:03,606
[SPEAKER_10]: They try to cut between me and the six inch gap between the rail.

962
01:03:03,847 --> 01:03:08,308
[SPEAKER_10]: When there's a nice three feet or more, probably like six feet on the other side of me.

963
01:03:09,568 --> 01:03:19,196
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, you... I think... I'm pretty convinced that everybody that works at VPD has no sense of, um... Well, let's see, no common sense.

964
01:03:19,596 --> 01:03:20,917
[SPEAKER_10]: They have no common sense whatsoever.

965
01:03:20,957 --> 01:03:22,258
[SPEAKER_10]: They're like, oh, I'm a split?

966
01:03:23,279 --> 01:03:24,720
[SPEAKER_10]: So, yeah.

967
01:03:25,360 --> 01:03:25,841
[SPEAKER_10]: F you to them.

968
01:03:26,221 --> 01:03:29,203
[SPEAKER_10]: F you to stupid drivers because you're still out there.

969
01:03:30,004 --> 01:03:30,464
[SPEAKER_10]: I hate you.

970
01:03:31,365 --> 01:03:34,907
[SPEAKER_10]: And F you to everybody that watches Oprah because, uh...

971
01:03:36,808 --> 01:03:39,889
[SPEAKER_13]: Because Oprah sucks and I loved it the other day.

972
01:03:39,910 --> 01:03:41,330
[SPEAKER_13]: Don't talk about my mother like that.

973
01:03:42,851 --> 01:03:45,392
[SPEAKER_10]: I loved it the other day after the Michael Jackson interview thing.

974
01:03:45,412 --> 01:03:46,892
[SPEAKER_10]: They're like doing a talkback.

975
01:03:47,432 --> 01:03:50,413
[SPEAKER_10]: Like acting like they're experts on the whole subject and everything.

976
01:03:50,473 --> 01:03:54,655
[SPEAKER_10]: And they absolutely had... I don't even think any of them watched the special.

977
01:03:55,370 --> 01:03:58,232
[SPEAKER_10]: and they're just talking back for a good two hours about the damn thing.

978
01:03:58,312 --> 01:03:59,432
[SPEAKER_10]: I just saw some... Oh, look!

979
01:03:59,612 --> 01:04:01,493
[SPEAKER_10]: Jack is still not talking about it.

980
01:04:01,513 --> 01:04:04,895
[SPEAKER_10]: Turned channel to, like, Vader's Gym or something like that.

981
01:04:05,616 --> 01:04:06,736
[SPEAKER_10]: Stupid fucking people.

982
01:04:06,836 --> 01:04:06,876
[SPEAKER_10]: Um...

983
01:04:09,210 --> 01:04:11,612
[SPEAKER_10]: F you to the people in the Congo.

984
01:04:12,733 --> 01:04:15,094
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to fucking cast an Ebola spell on your whole country.

985
01:04:15,315 --> 01:04:15,675
[SPEAKER_10]: So there.

986
01:04:15,915 --> 01:04:16,856
[SPEAKER_10]: What are you going to do now?

987
01:04:17,236 --> 01:04:17,977
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm in another country.

988
01:04:18,717 --> 01:04:19,338
[SPEAKER_14]: You can't touch me.

989
01:04:20,398 --> 01:04:20,999
[SPEAKER_14]: You're going to die.

990
01:04:21,179 --> 01:04:21,699
[SPEAKER_14]: From Ebola.

991
01:04:21,859 --> 01:04:22,920
[SPEAKER_10]: They'll cast rockets.

992
01:04:29,114 --> 01:04:33,216
[SPEAKER_10]: I weep for humanity, and these people that I weep, you know, cause me to weep.

993
01:04:33,556 --> 01:04:38,338
[SPEAKER_13]: That and the whole fact that they're shutting down the Folsom Dam because of the threat of terrorism.

994
01:04:38,658 --> 01:04:45,741
[SPEAKER_13]: Because, you know, people are going to come out of the middle of nowhere and just bomb the dam instead of, you know, bombing LA, San Francisco, you know, one of the major cities.

995
01:04:45,801 --> 01:04:48,562
[SPEAKER_21]: If Folsom Dam gets bombed, wouldn't it just flood the prison?

996
01:04:49,283 --> 01:04:51,504
[SPEAKER_14]: It would flood Sacramento with 12 feet of water.

997
01:04:51,524 --> 01:04:52,444
[SPEAKER_10]: Which I wouldn't listen to.

998
01:04:56,218 --> 01:04:58,559
[SPEAKER_21]: Do you realize how much Loki is like Nelson from the Simpsons?

999
01:04:58,679 --> 01:04:58,899
[SPEAKER_21]: Uh-huh!

1000
01:05:14,723 --> 01:05:15,804
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, and the best one.

1001
01:05:16,044 --> 01:05:17,966
[SPEAKER_14]: I just laughed my ass off when I saw this.

1002
01:05:18,226 --> 01:05:22,790
[SPEAKER_14]: That'd be the stupid doctors that botched that fucking transplant.

1003
01:05:22,871 --> 01:05:25,353
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, that was hilarious.

1004
01:05:25,693 --> 01:05:27,935
[SPEAKER_22]: The thing was labeled correctly.

1005
01:05:28,716 --> 01:05:29,957
[SPEAKER_22]: A... was it A?

1006
01:05:30,717 --> 01:05:31,238
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know.

1007
01:05:31,598 --> 01:05:33,280
[SPEAKER_22]: The organs were A and the girl was O.

1008
01:05:34,208 --> 01:05:39,450
[SPEAKER_14]: There doesn't go, there's a type of people trying to, you know, shove their round block through the square hole.

1009
01:05:40,511 --> 01:05:42,632
[SPEAKER_22]: Were they, were they, they weren't Kaiser, were they?

1010
01:05:42,732 --> 01:05:43,992
[SPEAKER_14]: It's so stupid.

1011
01:05:44,273 --> 01:05:45,313
[SPEAKER_14]: They're like trying to save her.

1012
01:05:45,353 --> 01:05:46,714
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm like, dude, she's so dead.

1013
01:05:50,373 --> 01:05:51,474
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm like, so surprised.

1014
01:05:51,635 --> 01:05:52,916
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my god, she died!

1015
01:05:53,136 --> 01:05:54,217
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't believe it!

1016
01:05:54,718 --> 01:05:56,380
[SPEAKER_22]: So shock, how could this happen?

1017
01:05:57,581 --> 01:06:01,485
[SPEAKER_22]: And there's her parents, though, who think, oh, we want a second opinion to see if she's a little brain dead.

1018
01:06:02,807 --> 01:06:03,748
[SPEAKER_14]: Uh, let's see here.

1019
01:06:03,768 --> 01:06:06,571
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean, I feel bad for them.

1020
01:06:07,191 --> 01:06:09,752
[SPEAKER_22]: that their daughter was lost due to incompetence.

1021
01:06:09,952 --> 01:06:12,734
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know, I'm no doctor or anything, but she's not moving and shit.

1022
01:06:13,014 --> 01:06:17,496
[SPEAKER_22]: But, no brain, I don't see how you can simulate a lack of brain activity.

1023
01:06:17,976 --> 01:06:18,897
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, well, she's brain dead.

1024
01:06:18,937 --> 01:06:23,659
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't know how you can get a second, you know, two tests that show zero brain activity.

1025
01:06:24,479 --> 01:06:29,101
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean, unless blind hope, blind faith, you know, wanting to grasp at anything.

1026
01:06:30,262 --> 01:06:34,264
[SPEAKER_22]: But, the first step towards healing and grieving...

1027
01:06:35,081 --> 01:06:37,203
[SPEAKER_22]: is realizing that you actually have something to grieve.

1028
01:06:37,543 --> 01:06:40,626
[SPEAKER_14]: We poked her with a stick, man.

1029
01:06:41,427 --> 01:06:42,167
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh yeah, another thing.

1030
01:06:42,788 --> 01:06:45,991
[SPEAKER_14]: F you to the stupid people in Rhode Island that got caught in that stupid fire.

1031
01:06:46,111 --> 01:06:46,871
[SPEAKER_14]: I know you're all dead.

1032
01:06:46,891 --> 01:06:48,353
[SPEAKER_22]: Isn't that a great white concert?

1033
01:06:48,373 --> 01:06:49,394
[SPEAKER_22]: Hold on, hold on, hold on.

1034
01:06:53,437 --> 01:06:55,418
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not going to cover what you're talking about.

1035
01:06:55,458 --> 01:06:58,259
[SPEAKER_09]: But what's hilarious is they're like, oh my god, this is so tragic.

1036
01:06:58,279 --> 01:07:02,101
[SPEAKER_14]: Hello, they just used the one exit instead of the three fire exits that are built in this place.

1037
01:07:02,582 --> 01:07:04,082
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, they're trying to get out the one door.

1038
01:07:04,102 --> 01:07:08,624
[SPEAKER_14]: Everyone's like, but there's exits over here marked fire exits in case of fire.

1039
01:07:08,725 --> 01:07:10,185
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, that's happening right now.

1040
01:07:10,205 --> 01:07:12,826
[SPEAKER_10]: Oops.

1041
01:07:13,327 --> 01:07:15,048
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I cry through humanity.

1042
01:07:19,075 --> 01:07:25,080
[SPEAKER_22]: All right, I have something to say about it.

1043
01:07:25,200 --> 01:07:28,942
[SPEAKER_13]: I have something to say about it.

1044
01:07:29,503 --> 01:07:30,464
[SPEAKER_13]: I have something to say about this.

1045
01:07:30,504 --> 01:07:39,010
[SPEAKER_13]: As long as we're... As long as we're... As long as we're joking about, you know, tragic events in the news, I have some things I'd like to say.

1046
01:07:40,911 --> 01:07:58,436
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, F you to the band Great White for setting that club on fire and killing a bunch of people, because I had to wait 45 minutes to get into the club last night, because they actually had to enforce the fire code, because you dolts burned down a club on the other side of the country.

1047
01:07:58,716 --> 01:08:05,478
[SPEAKER_13]: And I don't know if you've seen the video of this, but like when the thing's set on fire, all these people are looking at the roof going, dude, I think there's something on fire.

1048
01:08:06,238 --> 01:08:07,680
[SPEAKER_13]: I thought the club was on fire.

1049
01:08:07,980 --> 01:08:11,203
[SPEAKER_13]: When I stand there high off my ass going, dude, there's an 80s hairband.

1050
01:08:11,283 --> 01:08:13,405
[SPEAKER_13]: No, I would be high-tailing it out the fucking door.

1051
01:08:13,485 --> 01:08:15,947
[SPEAKER_13]: I'd push and trample all you people.

1052
01:08:16,748 --> 01:08:17,648
[SPEAKER_09]: God.

1053
01:08:20,291 --> 01:08:22,273
[SPEAKER_11]: And you know what the saddest thing about this whole thing is?

1054
01:08:23,494 --> 01:08:26,056
[SPEAKER_11]: Album sales are going to go through the roof for these guys.

1055
01:08:26,376 --> 01:08:26,977
[SPEAKER_11]: Pun intended.

1056
01:08:28,678 --> 01:08:30,520
[SPEAKER_22]: Great White is going to actually have a career again.

1057
01:08:33,208 --> 01:08:35,590
[SPEAKER_13]: That's the real tragedy here, ladies and gentlemen.

1058
01:08:35,750 --> 01:08:37,751
[SPEAKER_13]: Great White will bring the house down.

1059
01:08:41,993 --> 01:08:43,274
[SPEAKER_21]: I choked on my shrimp chips.

1060
01:08:43,914 --> 01:08:44,235
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright.

1061
01:08:46,562 --> 01:08:52,184
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyway, moving on, my other FUs of the week are mudslides on I-5.

1062
01:08:52,904 --> 01:09:00,066
[SPEAKER_13]: Because of mudslides on I-5, and I'm not talking about the drink, I'm talking about the actual mud sliding down the hill and covering the freeway.

1063
01:09:00,406 --> 01:09:06,488
[SPEAKER_13]: Because of that, we heard that traffic was blocked for hours, so we had to go down 101 to get to LA.

1064
01:09:06,548 --> 01:09:08,109
[SPEAKER_13]: That took like seven and a half hours.

1065
01:09:09,549 --> 01:09:10,049
[SPEAKER_13]: I hated it.

1066
01:09:10,869 --> 01:09:13,830
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, no, I didn't hate it because, you know, we were with good company, so it was all good.

1067
01:09:16,611 --> 01:09:21,014
[SPEAKER_22]: Part of the countryside alongside the grapevine was on fire.

1068
01:09:22,235 --> 01:09:22,435
[SPEAKER_11]: Cool.

1069
01:09:22,475 --> 01:09:24,977
[SPEAKER_22]: We were stuck in traffic for three hours on the grapevine.

1070
01:09:25,837 --> 01:09:29,160
[SPEAKER_22]: And then we went by and saw helicopters and fire, and I took pictures of it.

1071
01:09:29,800 --> 01:09:31,261
[SPEAKER_14]: Was Great White playing there, too?

1072
01:09:32,082 --> 01:09:32,922
[SPEAKER_22]: Actually, yes.

1073
01:09:33,062 --> 01:09:33,242
[SPEAKER_22]: No.

1074
01:09:36,685 --> 01:09:37,005
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

1075
01:09:39,207 --> 01:09:40,748
[SPEAKER_13]: Also, what else did my F use of the week?

1076
01:09:41,128 --> 01:09:41,228
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh.

1077
01:09:43,329 --> 01:09:45,591
[SPEAKER_13]: F. F. Stupid Children.

1078
01:09:47,887 --> 01:09:50,190
[SPEAKER_22]: Remember JB and I eat children.

1079
01:09:50,430 --> 01:09:53,133
[SPEAKER_13]: Children ramen.

1080
01:09:55,376 --> 01:09:56,557
[SPEAKER_22]: We've come up with different flavors.

1081
01:09:56,898 --> 01:09:59,040
[SPEAKER_22]: There's RVGL flavor that tastes like skank.

1082
01:10:00,542 --> 01:10:04,486
[SPEAKER_22]: And you know, Scandia flavor which is pretty crunchy and tasty.

1083
01:10:04,506 --> 01:10:05,788
[SPEAKER_22]: The CCL flavor tastes like ass.

1084
01:10:07,749 --> 01:10:08,230
[SPEAKER_13]: I got a few.

1085
01:10:08,290 --> 01:10:13,793
[SPEAKER_13]: One is to the jackass over in Scandia who thought it would be a good idea to try to punk everybody out of their tokens on the machine.

1086
01:10:28,741 --> 01:10:32,242
[SPEAKER_09]: He was like, I went up to go play a game, and there were like three tokens sitting up there.

1087
01:10:32,282 --> 01:10:37,664
[SPEAKER_04]: He came up and tried to steal my token, and then he tried to yell at me and start a fight with me on the extreme machine.

1088
01:10:48,112 --> 01:11:05,477
[SPEAKER_09]: and then he went off and he like got mad because he didn't get to play which he was just out to take people's tokens he would start punching the carousel thinking like that's a good way to get rid of the stress and also little kids who think there's a crosswalk across the DDR panels

1089
01:11:07,998 --> 01:11:08,939
[SPEAKER_09]: It's pretty simple.

1090
01:11:08,959 --> 01:11:11,661
[SPEAKER_13]: This is a raging epidemic in every arcade, I'm sure.

1091
01:11:11,761 --> 01:11:14,944
[SPEAKER_13]: Little kids who somehow see a crosswalk right there.

1092
01:11:15,865 --> 01:11:16,785
[SPEAKER_13]: What is up with that?

1093
01:11:16,845 --> 01:11:19,768
[SPEAKER_22]: Were you there when I grabbed the little kid and took her to his parents?

1094
01:11:19,788 --> 01:11:21,189
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, yes, I was.

1095
01:11:21,249 --> 01:11:21,769
[SPEAKER_13]: That was fabulous.

1096
01:11:21,789 --> 01:11:25,232
[SPEAKER_22]: Your child is going to end up with a broken foot if you don't watch your little kid.

1097
01:11:26,213 --> 01:11:29,315
[SPEAKER_22]: Because we were playing VR back when it was the USA Mission.

1098
01:11:29,335 --> 01:11:29,456
[SPEAKER_22]: Yep.

1099
01:11:31,733 --> 01:11:54,860
[SPEAKER_13]: And this little kid proceeds to walk across the machine and I grabbed the kid and took him to his parents This dates all the way back to the first episode of the show If you won't take care of your kids, god damn it, I will That was a quote from the very first episode from Jamie When I was sitting there and they had the little kids running across there I looked at a friend of mine, I don't know who it was And I said, is there a crosswalk across the machine?

1100
01:11:55,360 --> 01:11:57,221
[SPEAKER_07]: and his kid's mom heard me.

1101
01:11:57,361 --> 01:11:58,482
[SPEAKER_09]: His kid's mom heard me.

1102
01:11:58,682 --> 01:12:01,163
[SPEAKER_09]: She's all, excuse me, but I told him not to be doing that.

1103
01:12:01,263 --> 01:12:03,524
[SPEAKER_09]: I said, I wasn't even talking to you.

1104
01:12:03,684 --> 01:12:06,026
[SPEAKER_09]: I was just saying it, like, in general.

1105
01:12:06,046 --> 01:12:07,266
[SPEAKER_13]: I was yelling at your child.

1106
01:12:07,526 --> 01:12:10,328
[SPEAKER_09]: Shoot, there were so kids I wish I could be.

1107
01:12:10,548 --> 01:12:14,530
[SPEAKER_09]: And also, a big FU to the drunk lady in Scandia on Friday.

1108
01:12:14,550 --> 01:12:18,592
[SPEAKER_09]: She claimed she was from Brazil, Texas, New York, and, like, Europe somewhere.

1109
01:12:19,092 --> 01:12:24,155
[SPEAKER_09]: And she kept telling everybody how sexy they were, and she was so bombed out and drunk.

1110
01:12:24,895 --> 01:12:25,857
[SPEAKER_09]: It was pretty cool.

1111
01:12:25,957 --> 01:12:27,499
[SPEAKER_09]: And also, the last one was good.

1112
01:12:27,539 --> 01:12:28,220
[SPEAKER_09]: It was pretty cool.

1113
01:12:28,300 --> 01:12:29,061
[SPEAKER_09]: It was pretty cool.

1114
01:12:29,121 --> 01:12:30,042
[SPEAKER_09]: It was pretty cool.

1115
01:12:30,162 --> 01:12:30,903
[SPEAKER_09]: It was pretty cool.

1116
01:12:35,473 --> 01:12:40,474
[SPEAKER_07]: I went over there yesterday and I'm trying to pick out some soda to drink.

1117
01:12:40,514 --> 01:12:46,476
[SPEAKER_07]: And this lady comes up trying to put soda in my cart, trying to tell me that this is what you should get and this is what you should drink.

1118
01:12:46,736 --> 01:12:48,296
[SPEAKER_07]: And I was like, no.

1119
01:12:48,356 --> 01:12:55,118
[SPEAKER_07]: And she's like, I ended up just leaving my cart and walking out of the store because she put like four 12-packs in my thing after I told her no.

1120
01:12:55,158 --> 01:12:57,178
[SPEAKER_07]: And I was like, screw you, and I left.

1121
01:12:57,198 --> 01:12:58,719
[SPEAKER_07]: Because she was a bitch.

1122
01:12:59,239 --> 01:13:00,019
[SPEAKER_07]: And driver's divorce.

1123
01:13:02,722 --> 01:13:03,362
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, Jamie.

1124
01:13:03,442 --> 01:13:05,424
[SPEAKER_22]: I have another one.

1125
01:13:07,886 --> 01:13:09,147
[SPEAKER_22]: I think I just forgot what it was.

1126
01:13:11,689 --> 01:13:15,492
[SPEAKER_13]: He was talking about the drunk woman at Scandia, Texas, Brazil.

1127
01:13:16,292 --> 01:13:17,013
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes, I remember.

1128
01:13:17,753 --> 01:13:22,537
[SPEAKER_22]: Outside Target, there's these guys who will say, Hi, I'm taking a communication class, blah, blah, blah.

1129
01:13:22,557 --> 01:13:24,418
[SPEAKER_22]: This was part of, I think, Melody's Fuck You last week.

1130
01:13:24,799 --> 01:13:28,702
[SPEAKER_22]: Because there was someone who was incredibly rude to her with this.

1131
01:13:29,302 --> 01:13:32,364
[SPEAKER_22]: But, it feels gift-y to you, all these lines, and then they try to sell you magazines.

1132
01:13:32,424 --> 01:13:39,267
[SPEAKER_22]: So finally, I looked over to the guy, he says, yeah, I'm doing a communication project, and by the way, you know, I just wanted to talk to all the pretty women in the park.

1133
01:13:39,287 --> 01:13:39,787
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm like, okay.

1134
01:13:40,308 --> 01:13:41,808
[SPEAKER_22]: First of all, I don't want to buy magazines.

1135
01:13:42,589 --> 01:13:43,729
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, you've already talked to somebody.

1136
01:13:44,089 --> 01:13:47,551
[SPEAKER_22]: Know that my friend has them, quite honestly, no money belongs in my own goddamn pocket.

1137
01:13:47,691 --> 01:13:48,091
[SPEAKER_22]: Not in yours.

1138
01:13:49,712 --> 01:13:52,454
[SPEAKER_22]: And he's just like, don't you wanna buy one?

1139
01:13:52,514 --> 01:13:54,595
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm like, no, I'm not nice, leave.

1140
01:13:55,135 --> 01:13:55,615
[SPEAKER_22]: So he left.

1141
01:13:56,116 --> 01:13:56,476
[SPEAKER_22]: Fuck him.

1142
01:13:57,816 --> 01:13:59,577
[SPEAKER_07]: Another one, back to CCL.

1143
01:13:59,877 --> 01:14:01,138
[SPEAKER_07]: Oops, sorry.

1144
01:14:01,158 --> 01:14:10,203
[SPEAKER_07]: When they thought, like, they tell everyone that their pads are all in good condition, why did I feel like I had doubles heavy, like, in the middle of the song, and none of the right pad work?

1145
01:14:10,763 --> 01:14:15,885
[SPEAKER_09]: and the stupid little rabbit girl who, like, would not stay off of the pad when I was trying to get up.

1146
01:14:15,925 --> 01:14:23,168
[SPEAKER_09]: I, like, seriously, if I was a girl who would be a rabbit girl, I would be a rabbit girl.

1147
01:14:23,228 --> 01:14:27,129
[SPEAKER_22]: I should have stepped on her clothing a little more.

1148
01:14:27,369 --> 01:14:28,410
[SPEAKER_12]: She walked away.

1149
01:14:30,651 --> 01:14:33,232
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, let's move on to the chatroom FUs, shall we?

1150
01:14:33,272 --> 01:14:35,152
[SPEAKER_22]: Play happy music.

1151
01:14:35,172 --> 01:14:36,373
[SPEAKER_13]: Brace yourself, there's a ton.

1152
01:14:38,581 --> 01:14:58,858
[SPEAKER_13]: Muhimer says, fuck word problems, fuck winter storms that lead to flooding of the massive sort, fuck my school for saying that school was cancelled Thursday because of snow and then deciding to change their minds a full day the night before, fuck my dad for still not getting cable so I can have wireless with my laptop and download Mutros DDR stuff, sad face, fuck my heater for breaking also, and fuck the new one for causing my allergies to annihilate me.

1153
01:15:00,219 --> 01:15:04,643
[SPEAKER_13]: EvilNauki2DX says, fuck you to people who don't know how to follow forum rules.

1154
01:15:06,243 --> 01:15:06,603
[SPEAKER_13]: Beautiful.

1155
01:15:08,224 --> 01:15:10,104
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkTetsuya says, F you to being single.

1156
01:15:10,384 --> 01:15:10,665
[SPEAKER_13]: Amen.

1157
01:15:11,325 --> 01:15:15,466
[SPEAKER_13]: Winamp3 for crashing consistently on my MP3 CDs and one more I can't think of.

1158
01:15:15,646 --> 01:15:16,586
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, wait, I remembered.

1159
01:15:17,027 --> 01:15:20,228
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, F you to Sky for playing that shitty Vanessa May song.

1160
01:15:20,548 --> 01:15:21,908
[SPEAKER_13]: Now I know such a thing exists.

1161
01:15:22,288 --> 01:15:25,209
[SPEAKER_13]: I have a shitty Vanessa May song from Dance Mania 9.

1162
01:15:25,930 --> 01:15:26,870
[SPEAKER_13]: It's some remix.

1163
01:15:27,150 --> 01:15:32,252
[SPEAKER_13]: There's like no violin and like one verse of hers looped.

1164
01:15:32,332 --> 01:15:32,892
[SPEAKER_13]: It's horrible.

1165
01:15:32,932 --> 01:15:33,352
[SPEAKER_13]: It's awful.

1166
01:15:33,412 --> 01:15:33,832
[SPEAKER_13]: It's putrid.

1167
01:15:33,852 --> 01:15:34,833
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll play it for you after the show.

1168
01:15:36,173 --> 01:15:36,933
[SPEAKER_13]: It's really sad.

1169
01:15:37,033 --> 01:15:40,114
[SPEAKER_13]: But it's a remix, so it doesn't really count.

1170
01:15:40,254 --> 01:15:40,995
[SPEAKER_13]: It's not really hard, then.

1171
01:15:41,175 --> 01:15:42,055
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, exactly.

1172
01:15:44,716 --> 01:15:47,336
[SPEAKER_13]: Hey, I got a nephew.

1173
01:15:47,396 --> 01:15:52,618
[SPEAKER_13]: RiceRYC3 says, Fuck you, Gray Davis, for cutting the funds for my school.

1174
01:15:52,718 --> 01:15:54,779
[SPEAKER_13]: I need my damn classes to transfer ASAP.

1175
01:15:59,232 --> 01:16:01,434
[SPEAKER_13]: They're, like, upping it to $24 a unit instead of $11.

1176
01:16:01,554 --> 01:16:03,736
[SPEAKER_13]: So, it's absolutely pointless.

1177
01:16:04,337 --> 01:16:07,579
[SPEAKER_09]: Did you know, folks, that college is completely useless and was a waste of money?

1178
01:16:07,699 --> 01:16:13,224
[SPEAKER_09]: All those people that get out of college end up coming to work at my work, and they get entry-level positions.

1179
01:16:13,485 --> 01:16:18,949
[SPEAKER_10]: Whereas I haven't gone to college, or I tried going to college for a semester, and said, this is fucking boring and a waste of my money.

1180
01:16:20,010 --> 01:16:23,273
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm earning, maybe not as much as they are, but you know what?

1181
01:16:23,293 --> 01:16:24,814
[SPEAKER_10]: They gotta pay back those college loans.

1182
01:16:24,895 --> 01:16:26,296
[SPEAKER_10]: So, technically, I'm above them.

1183
01:16:27,404 --> 01:16:34,249
[SPEAKER_22]: The one advantage of going to college at least for three years is that companies, when they hire you, they do have to hire you for a little bit more.

1184
01:16:35,550 --> 01:16:37,411
[SPEAKER_22]: If you've had, like, two or more years of college.

1185
01:16:37,932 --> 01:16:38,392
[SPEAKER_22]: I've had three!

1186
01:16:40,454 --> 01:16:44,477
[SPEAKER_13]: I wonder if I got screwed at my company, because I've had three, even though I don't have a piece of paper to show it.

1187
01:16:46,075 --> 01:16:50,676
[SPEAKER_13]: Daft Square says, fuck everybody who doesn't like oatmeal raisin cookies because they fucking rule.

1188
01:16:51,097 --> 01:16:51,737
[SPEAKER_22]: I hate raisins.

1189
01:16:52,117 --> 01:16:52,457
[SPEAKER_22]: Die.

1190
01:16:53,817 --> 01:16:55,158
[SPEAKER_13]: What about just oatmeal cookies then?

1191
01:16:55,498 --> 01:16:56,458
[SPEAKER_13]: That was Daft Square.

1192
01:16:56,838 --> 01:16:58,339
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, well don't die, but I hate raisins.

1193
01:16:58,979 --> 01:17:00,300
[SPEAKER_22]: I like oatmeal chocolate chip cookies.

1194
01:17:01,420 --> 01:17:03,060
[SPEAKER_22]: How about like... Oatmeal cream pies!

1195
01:17:04,081 --> 01:17:04,481
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

1196
01:17:05,527 --> 01:17:07,910
[SPEAKER_22]: Oatmeal Cookies are like, official costumes in here.

1197
01:17:08,611 --> 01:17:12,937
[SPEAKER_13]: She gets her oatmeal cookie fixes in other ways, that's fine.

1198
01:17:13,117 --> 01:17:16,302
[SPEAKER_13]: 23rd Magus says, fuck you to the worm that's still going through these net servers.

1199
01:17:16,342 --> 01:17:18,064
[SPEAKER_13]: It probably brought down LiveJournal the other day.

1200
01:17:18,204 --> 01:17:20,467
[SPEAKER_13]: Actually, a denial of service attack brought down LiveJournal.

1201
01:17:20,507 --> 01:17:21,468
[SPEAKER_13]: Fuck people to do that.

1202
01:17:22,029 --> 01:17:22,410
[SPEAKER_13]: Jesus.

1203
01:17:22,770 --> 01:17:24,673
[SPEAKER_13]: The denialist, you know what denialist service attack is?

1204
01:17:24,693 --> 01:17:32,423
[SPEAKER_13]: That's when you get like all the computers that like paying a server like Yahoo or CNN or whatever to try and take it down, to overload it and take it down.

1205
01:17:32,704 --> 01:17:33,926
[SPEAKER_13]: That's what happened to LiveJournal the other day.

1206
01:17:34,286 --> 01:17:36,970
[SPEAKER_13]: But you know they credited all the paid users with four extra days because of it.

1207
01:17:37,708 --> 01:17:37,988
[SPEAKER_22]: Really?

1208
01:17:38,689 --> 01:17:39,570
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay, I didn't notice.

1209
01:17:40,030 --> 01:17:40,651
[SPEAKER_22]: Yep, they did.

1210
01:17:40,691 --> 01:17:41,972
[SPEAKER_22]: Mine's paid through June anyway.

1211
01:17:42,532 --> 01:17:43,653
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, now it's paid through June 4th.

1212
01:17:45,034 --> 01:17:48,357
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, stupid fucking lamer hackers, I agree.

1213
01:17:48,877 --> 01:17:49,478
[SPEAKER_13]: Fuck them, I say.

1214
01:17:49,558 --> 01:17:51,460
[SPEAKER_13]: Fuck them in their ears, because their asses ain't good enough.

1215
01:17:51,700 --> 01:17:56,344
[SPEAKER_22]: If they wanted their accounts to be cool, they should pay for it.

1216
01:17:56,424 --> 01:17:57,284
[SPEAKER_22]: It's $25 for a year.

1217
01:17:57,965 --> 01:17:58,966
[SPEAKER_22]: Fuck all of you, I'm sorry.

1218
01:17:59,406 --> 01:18:01,908
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, I mean, but the LiveJournal went down for the paid users, too.

1219
01:18:01,928 --> 01:18:02,729
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, that sucks.

1220
01:18:02,749 --> 01:18:03,850
[SPEAKER_22]: But yeah, but it's their fault.

1221
01:18:05,672 --> 01:18:09,143
[SPEAKER_13]: Fuck Skrull, as usual, and fuck taking a zero period during lunch.

1222
01:18:09,263 --> 01:18:11,029
[SPEAKER_13]: I can't eat lunch anymore, bitches.

1223
01:18:11,530 --> 01:18:12,232
[SPEAKER_13]: Is that legal?

1224
01:18:15,057 --> 01:18:18,938
[SPEAKER_09]: I actually had an issue with that back in seventh grade.

1225
01:18:19,338 --> 01:18:22,680
[SPEAKER_09]: By law, they have to give you time to at least buy your lunch.

1226
01:18:22,740 --> 01:18:25,120
[SPEAKER_09]: You can't have like five days of lunch.

1227
01:18:25,180 --> 01:18:26,821
[SPEAKER_09]: You have to be able to eat lunch.

1228
01:18:26,861 --> 01:18:27,881
[SPEAKER_09]: It is against the law.

1229
01:18:28,762 --> 01:18:30,042
[SPEAKER_13]: That is so weird.

1230
01:18:30,962 --> 01:18:35,244
[SPEAKER_13]: And I thought zero period meant... I thought zero... This is 23rd magazine.

1231
01:18:35,804 --> 01:18:38,825
[SPEAKER_13]: Zero period was called zero period because it was before first period.

1232
01:18:41,030 --> 01:18:43,051
[SPEAKER_13]: or, you know, well, I guess it depends.

1233
01:18:43,271 --> 01:18:43,871
[SPEAKER_13]: I guess it depends.

1234
01:18:44,051 --> 01:18:45,272
[SPEAKER_13]: Like, our schools didn't have a home.

1235
01:18:45,292 --> 01:18:46,192
[SPEAKER_13]: We didn't have a home.

1236
01:18:46,212 --> 01:18:48,173
[SPEAKER_22]: We had a home at my school, but it's now down.

1237
01:18:48,713 --> 01:18:52,475
[SPEAKER_22]: And the thing is, it is against the law for them to deny you your lunch time.

1238
01:18:52,495 --> 01:18:57,358
[SPEAKER_22]: So if you know what you need to do, you need to find whatever documentation you have on that.

1239
01:18:57,758 --> 01:19:00,479
[SPEAKER_22]: Send it not only to the school board, send it to the PTA.

1240
01:19:01,480 --> 01:19:03,841
[SPEAKER_22]: I guarantee you the soccer mobs are going to be on there.

1241
01:19:04,932 --> 01:19:06,333
[SPEAKER_13]: That's right, stick the soccer moms on him.

1242
01:19:06,453 --> 01:19:07,654
[SPEAKER_09]: Excellent suggestion.

1243
01:19:07,935 --> 01:19:08,595
[SPEAKER_09]: That's your job.

1244
01:19:08,635 --> 01:19:09,456
[SPEAKER_13]: They look thick.

1245
01:19:09,576 --> 01:19:10,797
[SPEAKER_13]: Ooh, I can pitch you something.

1246
01:19:10,877 --> 01:19:12,258
[SPEAKER_13]: Mama Jamie's looking out for you.

1247
01:19:12,638 --> 01:19:13,839
[SPEAKER_13]: Stick the soccer moms on him.

1248
01:19:17,239 --> 01:19:29,788
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, uh, and you thought 23rd Magus' Angst was over, no, fuck you to Burning Heat SSR, oh, he's old school there, for being so friggin' hard to beat, and own you to We Will Rock You, easiest kata ever, out.

1249
01:19:30,929 --> 01:19:32,310
[SPEAKER_13]: We Will Rock You's not a kata.

1250
01:19:32,330 --> 01:19:33,351
[SPEAKER_13]: It is not a kata.

1251
01:19:33,371 --> 01:19:34,592
[SPEAKER_13]: It's like a six.

1252
01:19:34,832 --> 01:19:36,113
[SPEAKER_13]: Unless, oh, maybe on doubles.

1253
01:19:36,693 --> 01:19:38,074
[SPEAKER_14]: No, not even on doubles, dude.

1254
01:19:38,694 --> 01:19:39,255
[SPEAKER_14]: No way.

1255
01:19:39,535 --> 01:19:40,275
[SPEAKER_14]: That's like, oh.

1256
01:19:40,636 --> 01:19:40,856
[SPEAKER_14]: Dude, dude.

1257
01:19:40,876 --> 01:19:43,077
[SPEAKER_14]: Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1258
01:19:43,097 --> 01:19:45,038
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, I thought it was only like seven or eight at the most.

1259
01:19:45,058 --> 01:19:45,819
[SPEAKER_13]: Wait, wait, wait.

1260
01:19:46,900 --> 01:19:48,721
[SPEAKER_13]: You got a heart, Jamie, in the chat room?

1261
01:19:48,781 --> 01:19:50,582
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know.

1262
01:19:50,722 --> 01:19:51,182
[SPEAKER_13]: Just because.

1263
01:19:53,044 --> 01:19:54,525
[SPEAKER_22]: Just explain to me why I have a heart.

1264
01:19:54,945 --> 01:19:56,666
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkTetsu, you put we heart DS.

1265
01:19:57,346 --> 01:19:58,127
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, thank you.

1266
01:19:59,228 --> 01:20:00,308
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't have a heart, though.

1267
01:20:01,169 --> 01:20:02,610
[SPEAKER_22]: I have a lump of coal like Smurfette.

1268
01:20:02,630 --> 01:20:03,510
[SPEAKER_22]: You do, it's just black.

1269
01:20:04,211 --> 01:20:05,972
[SPEAKER_22]: I have a lump of coal like Smurfette.

1270
01:20:07,620 --> 01:20:11,483
[SPEAKER_22]: And if you don't remember, when Smurfette showed up, she had black hair and had a heart of coal.

1271
01:20:12,123 --> 01:20:14,925
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, this is what 23 Magazine is elaborating.

1272
01:20:15,005 --> 01:20:17,587
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, 23 Magazine is answering some of your questions here.

1273
01:20:17,927 --> 01:20:24,372
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, he can't go before school, can't make it, for whatever reason, so he has to go during lunch, which means he cannot eat.

1274
01:20:24,412 --> 01:20:26,353
[SPEAKER_13]: Either I give up lunch or I give up graduating.

1275
01:20:27,514 --> 01:20:28,034
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't buy it.

1276
01:20:28,074 --> 01:20:28,915
[SPEAKER_13]: Take it to the PTA.

1277
01:20:29,015 --> 01:20:31,677
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean, not that I don't believe you, but take it to the PTA.

1278
01:20:31,697 --> 01:20:36,160
[SPEAKER_22]: They, by law, have to find a way to make that work for you to have lunch.

1279
01:20:37,873 --> 01:20:45,257
[SPEAKER_07]: No, what we actually ended up doing was the parents got together and they sent a letter to the district superintendent.

1280
01:20:45,337 --> 01:20:47,319
[SPEAKER_07]: And he was the one who went and changed all that around.

1281
01:20:47,759 --> 01:20:50,861
[SPEAKER_13]: And he actually made it so we didn't have to do it.

1282
01:20:50,881 --> 01:20:55,323
[SPEAKER_03]: That we actually didn't have to take the class.

1283
01:20:55,343 --> 01:20:57,124
[SPEAKER_22]: You need to send that to the authority.

1284
01:20:57,184 --> 01:20:57,945
[SPEAKER_22]: Don't sit on this.

1285
01:20:58,025 --> 01:20:59,446
[SPEAKER_22]: Make sure that something gets taken care of.

1286
01:21:00,246 --> 01:21:01,287
[SPEAKER_22]: Be an activist.

1287
01:21:02,828 --> 01:21:05,589
[SPEAKER_22]: Nothing ever changes until you make it change.

1288
01:21:06,290 --> 01:21:06,510
[SPEAKER_22]: Right?

1289
01:21:07,373 --> 01:21:08,852
[SPEAKER_14]: Yep, very true, very true.

1290
01:21:11,176 --> 01:21:11,596
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

1291
01:21:12,497 --> 01:21:13,757
[SPEAKER_13]: Black Lab has some FUs.

1292
01:21:13,817 --> 01:21:14,297
[SPEAKER_13]: Puppy.

1293
01:21:14,757 --> 01:21:15,938
[SPEAKER_13]: Puppy, why aren't you here?

1294
01:21:15,958 --> 01:21:16,638
[SPEAKER_13]: Fuck the cold.

1295
01:21:16,718 --> 01:21:18,039
[SPEAKER_13]: It's been making my skin break out.

1296
01:21:18,079 --> 01:21:18,799
[SPEAKER_13]: Fuck midterms.

1297
01:21:18,839 --> 01:21:19,179
[SPEAKER_13]: I hate them.

1298
01:21:19,199 --> 01:21:19,619
[SPEAKER_13]: They suck.

1299
01:21:19,659 --> 01:21:24,421
[SPEAKER_13]: Fuck my suitemates for smoking weed every day this past two weeks and making the whole suit sweet stink.

1300
01:21:24,921 --> 01:21:26,862
[SPEAKER_13]: Fuck this sore throat that just came up this morning.

1301
01:21:26,902 --> 01:21:28,623
[SPEAKER_13]: Fuck my horrible sleep pattern right now.

1302
01:21:28,663 --> 01:21:29,803
[SPEAKER_13]: I keep sleeping through classes.

1303
01:21:29,983 --> 01:21:30,343
[SPEAKER_13]: One more.

1304
01:21:30,443 --> 01:21:36,806
[SPEAKER_13]: Fuck Tapioca Express for not turning up the volume on their machine even after I spent two hours cleaning the pads for them.

1305
01:21:37,666 --> 01:21:39,187
[SPEAKER_13]: Wow, that's dedication right there.

1306
01:21:39,207 --> 01:21:39,287
[SPEAKER_13]: Shit.

1307
01:21:41,500 --> 01:21:42,640
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh my god!

1308
01:21:42,660 --> 01:21:46,582
[SPEAKER_13]: Hey, it's a novel!

1309
01:21:46,882 --> 01:21:48,442
[SPEAKER_13]: You people are raping this privilege.

1310
01:21:49,042 --> 01:21:50,463
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, here we go.

1311
01:21:50,523 --> 01:21:52,764
[SPEAKER_13]: SnubDisanoid says, Big old fat F you.

1312
01:21:52,784 --> 01:21:53,964
[SPEAKER_13]: That's an understatement here, too.

1313
01:21:54,044 --> 01:22:00,466
[SPEAKER_13]: First off, fuck you to the people at CCL who decided that just because someone stringed the machine for tons of credits, it was okay to hog the machine like a bunch of motherfuckers.

1314
01:22:00,966 --> 01:22:05,868
[SPEAKER_13]: I had to wait 90 minutes for one fucking game of DDR, and it was versus with some pretentious and not very good little...

1315
01:22:06,828 --> 01:22:07,889
[SPEAKER_13]: The blanket is blank.

1316
01:22:08,209 --> 01:22:09,910
[SPEAKER_13]: Even I, that's too dirty for me to read.

1317
01:22:11,812 --> 01:22:17,555
[SPEAKER_13]: Little come in his shit, asshole.

1318
01:22:18,436 --> 01:22:21,258
[SPEAKER_13]: It made me play on the two-player pads, which suck major ass.

1319
01:22:21,678 --> 01:22:25,040
[SPEAKER_13]: Secondly, fuck you to CCL for not fixing the two-player pads for so long.

1320
01:22:25,120 --> 01:22:25,701
[SPEAKER_13]: I understand.

1321
01:22:26,401 --> 01:22:29,563
[SPEAKER_13]: That it's hard to repair the pads when people string the machine so excessively.

1322
01:22:29,983 --> 01:22:34,586
[SPEAKER_13]: But it's been about two months now and the down and right arrows don't work unless you weigh 400 pounds.

1323
01:22:34,806 --> 01:22:36,567
[SPEAKER_13]: So fuck them for having such shitty pads.

1324
01:22:36,847 --> 01:22:37,427
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, hold on.

1325
01:22:37,547 --> 01:22:41,390
[SPEAKER_07]: I've never met the DubZipNoid guy or whatever his name is.

1326
01:22:42,290 --> 01:22:42,790
[SPEAKER_07]: Who is he?

1327
01:22:42,950 --> 01:22:48,073
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I talked to someone last night for like, while we were waiting after everyone filled all the pre-credits.

1328
01:22:48,213 --> 01:22:50,855
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know, is he like an Asian dude?

1329
01:22:52,333 --> 01:22:53,033
[SPEAKER_13]: I have no idea.

1330
01:22:53,053 --> 01:22:55,594
[SPEAKER_13]: You guys should meet offline or something.

1331
01:22:55,614 --> 01:22:56,494
[SPEAKER_10]: This is horrible radio.

1332
01:22:56,514 --> 01:22:58,555
[SPEAKER_10]: Why doesn't anyone watch those cameras?

1333
01:22:58,635 --> 01:23:01,875
[SPEAKER_10]: And they have, like... What's the point of having cameras?

1334
01:23:03,276 --> 01:23:05,836
[SPEAKER_13]: They're like those fake ones you buy at the store, the candy cameras.

1335
01:23:07,517 --> 01:23:08,137
[SPEAKER_09]: They have them.

1336
01:23:08,557 --> 01:23:13,018
[SPEAKER_09]: All you can see, though, are, like, the lights of the speakers and the talk.

1337
01:23:13,038 --> 01:23:14,759
[SPEAKER_13]: You can't see anywhere down on the bottom.

1338
01:23:14,779 --> 01:23:18,780
[SPEAKER_22]: Didn't they say in clips that people usually try to be honest and they think they're being watched?

1339
01:23:19,300 --> 01:23:19,580
[SPEAKER_13]: Very true.

1340
01:23:22,741 --> 01:23:27,043
[SPEAKER_13]: Fuck the dumb little bitches that decided to drive on the shoulder in their Mustang and then merge with traffic.

1341
01:23:27,363 --> 01:23:28,504
[SPEAKER_13]: Somebody did that to me the other day.

1342
01:23:28,584 --> 01:23:29,044
[SPEAKER_13]: I hate that.

1343
01:23:29,444 --> 01:23:30,585
[SPEAKER_13]: Almost fucking slamming into us.

1344
01:23:30,645 --> 01:23:33,406
[SPEAKER_13]: I hate to call anyone a bitch, but they fucking deserved it.

1345
01:23:33,746 --> 01:23:36,427
[SPEAKER_13]: And after almost slamming into us, they laughed like giddy-ass schoolgirls.

1346
01:23:36,467 --> 01:23:36,888
[SPEAKER_13]: Fuck you.

1347
01:23:39,149 --> 01:23:41,210
[SPEAKER_22]: You know, I have an explanation on that.

1348
01:23:41,390 --> 01:23:42,290
[SPEAKER_22]: Fuck big trucks.

1349
01:23:43,110 --> 01:23:44,251
[SPEAKER_22]: We try to run you off the road.

1350
01:23:46,332 --> 01:23:46,592
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah.

1351
01:23:47,888 --> 01:23:51,631
[SPEAKER_13]: And finally, fuck you to the Queen Kong gorilla girl that fucking butchered my hair.

1352
01:23:51,711 --> 01:23:54,753
[SPEAKER_13]: If my hair slips through your fingers, don't cut my fucking hair, please.

1353
01:23:55,173 --> 01:24:01,677
[SPEAKER_13]: I asked for a trim so I don't look like a hobo while keeping my sort of sideburns and I get half my fucking hair shaved off.

1354
01:24:02,217 --> 01:24:06,160
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't have sideburns and my head looked like a fucking mushroom for three weeks.

1355
01:24:06,240 --> 01:24:06,640
[SPEAKER_13]: Fuck that.

1356
01:24:06,860 --> 01:24:07,501
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, there you go.

1357
01:24:07,561 --> 01:24:09,162
[SPEAKER_13]: Did you see anyone that looked like a mushroom, Zero?

1358
01:24:15,915 --> 01:24:22,680
[SPEAKER_13]: I think this is a new person listening to the show, so hello to Ninja Usagi Koi, which means bunny, does it?

1359
01:24:24,481 --> 01:24:27,403
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes, either that's Koios in love or Koios in fish.

1360
01:24:28,937 --> 01:24:29,637
[SPEAKER_13]: What about Usagi?

1361
01:24:29,677 --> 01:24:30,198
[SPEAKER_13]: Is that bunny?

1362
01:24:30,518 --> 01:24:31,418
[SPEAKER_13]: Is that bunny love?

1363
01:24:31,458 --> 01:24:32,159
[SPEAKER_13]: Ninja bunny love?

1364
01:24:32,719 --> 01:24:33,499
[SPEAKER_22]: Ninja bunny love.

1365
01:24:33,960 --> 01:24:34,380
[SPEAKER_13]: Awesome.

1366
01:24:35,160 --> 01:24:35,480
[SPEAKER_13]: That's cool.

1367
01:24:35,721 --> 01:24:38,962
[SPEAKER_13]: My sister would love you because my sister is a total bunny addict.

1368
01:24:39,462 --> 01:24:41,924
[SPEAKER_03]: Unless it's a Sailor Moon reference, which is weird.

1369
01:24:42,144 --> 01:24:42,484
[SPEAKER_13]: Who knows?

1370
01:24:43,084 --> 01:24:47,707
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyway, I want to send an FU to my friend for playing Involuntary Twister with me on DDR.

1371
01:24:49,327 --> 01:24:49,968
[SPEAKER_13]: Sounds kinky.

1372
01:24:50,028 --> 01:24:51,669
[SPEAKER_22]: Did you get that on film?

1373
01:24:55,030 --> 01:24:55,351
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright.

1374
01:24:57,111 --> 01:24:57,531
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's see.

1375
01:24:58,252 --> 01:25:04,073
[SPEAKER_13]: JB says, my FU goes to SyFam having to be in Italy, so it'll take forever for my customized CD order for them to get there.

1376
01:25:04,433 --> 01:25:07,815
[SPEAKER_13]: An FU to the Safari Trance mix for Jamie sounding blah.

1377
01:25:08,915 --> 01:25:09,595
[SPEAKER_22]: Send it to me anyway.

1378
01:25:09,615 --> 01:25:10,455
[SPEAKER_22]: Send me what you have to find.

1379
01:25:11,076 --> 01:25:12,656
[SPEAKER_13]: You can't mix Safari to Trance.

1380
01:25:12,696 --> 01:25:13,256
[SPEAKER_13]: It doesn't work.

1381
01:25:13,316 --> 01:25:14,557
[SPEAKER_13]: It's like Jungle in the Trance.

1382
01:25:15,317 --> 01:25:18,978
[SPEAKER_22]: Actually, I want to make a suggestion for a new monthly contest.

1383
01:25:20,516 --> 01:25:22,157
[SPEAKER_13]: We haven't even finished the rules for our other one.

1384
01:25:22,177 --> 01:25:25,778
[SPEAKER_22]: Let's finish this one, though, but I have a really good idea.

1385
01:25:25,798 --> 01:25:26,998
[SPEAKER_22]: Finish the Vikings first.

1386
01:25:27,078 --> 01:25:27,358
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay.

1387
01:25:28,118 --> 01:25:31,279
[SPEAKER_13]: VidPawa says, F you to cartoon heroes for being hard.

1388
01:25:31,399 --> 01:25:31,779
[SPEAKER_13]: I agree.

1389
01:25:32,379 --> 01:25:35,680
[SPEAKER_13]: F you to teachers who yell at your class when you haven't done anything wrong.

1390
01:25:36,240 --> 01:25:37,001
[SPEAKER_13]: F you to homework.

1391
01:25:37,161 --> 01:25:38,181
[SPEAKER_13]: F you to research papers.

1392
01:25:38,221 --> 01:25:41,522
[SPEAKER_13]: And finally, F you to people who vandalize apartments that your family owns.

1393
01:25:41,982 --> 01:25:43,562
[SPEAKER_13]: Luckily, no one lives in those apartments.

1394
01:25:44,283 --> 01:25:44,743
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1395
01:25:46,584 --> 01:25:47,524
[SPEAKER_13]: Too much crime in Vegas.

1396
01:25:48,265 --> 01:25:50,546
[SPEAKER_13]: USFVB says, fuck you to every new program.

1397
01:25:50,566 --> 01:25:53,448
[SPEAKER_13]: For some reason they always find the stupidest fucking person to talk to.

1398
01:25:55,850 --> 01:25:56,870
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

1399
01:25:57,130 --> 01:25:57,431
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

1400
01:25:57,891 --> 01:26:01,013
[SPEAKER_13]: Vandalist says, F you to all the freaking mosquitoes out there.

1401
01:26:01,233 --> 01:26:01,573
[SPEAKER_13]: Amen.

1402
01:26:08,700 --> 01:26:09,702
[SPEAKER_21]: That's like 85% of your friends.

1403
01:26:24,246 --> 01:26:30,330
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, I'll tell you my suggestion during one of the breaks, and we'll see if it's... Okay, we'll do that.

1404
01:26:30,550 --> 01:26:32,511
[SPEAKER_13]: In fact, we'll go ahead and take a quick break right now.

1405
01:26:32,531 --> 01:26:36,374
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm going to bring up some shirt that USFBB gave me a site.

1406
01:26:36,394 --> 01:26:37,454
[SPEAKER_13]: We'll look at that during the break, too.

1407
01:26:38,335 --> 01:26:40,696
[SPEAKER_13]: And we've got the second half of the CyberBeat stuff.

1408
01:26:40,716 --> 01:26:42,697
[SPEAKER_13]: The post-freestyle interview is coming up.

1409
01:26:42,797 --> 01:26:44,178
[SPEAKER_13]: Those should be very interesting.

1410
01:26:44,859 --> 01:26:48,581
[SPEAKER_13]: In the meantime, we're going to take a quick break, and we'll start it off with... I don't know, what?

1411
01:26:49,061 --> 01:26:49,682
[SPEAKER_13]: What should we hear, Jamie?

1412
01:26:49,702 --> 01:26:49,882
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's see.

1413
01:26:51,145 --> 01:26:52,166
[SPEAKER_22]: Um, you know what?

1414
01:26:52,266 --> 01:26:54,567
[SPEAKER_22]: How about in celebration of my very first seven star?

1415
01:26:55,687 --> 01:26:56,228
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, okay.

1416
01:26:57,208 --> 01:26:58,209
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, God, I hope I have it.

1417
01:26:58,629 --> 01:26:59,309
[SPEAKER_13]: Uh, I know I do.

1418
01:26:59,409 --> 01:26:59,790
[SPEAKER_13]: I know I do.

1419
01:26:59,830 --> 01:27:00,170
[SPEAKER_13]: I know I do.

1420
01:27:01,751 --> 01:27:02,591
[SPEAKER_13]: I know I do somewhere.

1421
01:27:03,331 --> 01:27:04,112
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, we'll do that.

1422
01:27:05,392 --> 01:27:06,353
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, we'll be back.

1423
01:28:33,248 --> 01:28:33,749
and many more.

1424
01:32:24,098 --> 01:32:29,881
[SPEAKER_17]: Please listen to Orange Lounge Radio, because real radio makes Captain Jack cry.

1425
01:32:34,994 --> 01:32:36,435
[SPEAKER_13]: That's brilliant.

1426
01:33:03,432 --> 01:33:12,827
[SPEAKER_22]: We posted a link in the chatroom, by the way, which is a shirt that I'm going to make out of a banner that I made a long time ago for Under Sedation Live.

1427
01:33:14,668 --> 01:33:15,668
[SPEAKER_22]: That shirt rules.

1428
01:33:16,469 --> 01:33:16,949
[SPEAKER_13]: They have one.

1429
01:33:17,429 --> 01:33:18,989
[SPEAKER_13]: They have Clit R Us instead of Toys R Us.

1430
01:33:19,469 --> 01:33:20,210
[SPEAKER_13]: Asthma is sexy.

1431
01:33:20,230 --> 01:33:21,310
[SPEAKER_13]: This is my favorite one, though.

1432
01:33:21,610 --> 01:33:23,310
[SPEAKER_13]: On the front, it's a front and back shirt.

1433
01:33:23,350 --> 01:33:26,231
[SPEAKER_13]: On the front, it says, there's two people fucking on the back of my shirt.

1434
01:33:26,551 --> 01:33:28,492
[SPEAKER_13]: And then on the back, it says, just kidding, believe in Jesus.

1435
01:33:29,152 --> 01:33:32,433
[SPEAKER_13]: And it has this picture of Jesus that looks like Buddy Christ or something.

1436
01:33:33,193 --> 01:33:33,653
[SPEAKER_13]: It's great.

1437
01:33:33,693 --> 01:33:35,834
[SPEAKER_13]: And then the other one, where were some of the other ones that were funny?

1438
01:33:37,773 --> 01:33:42,015
[SPEAKER_14]: There's one that's in really small print on the front that says, if you're already this close, why don't you just suck my dick?

1439
01:33:43,536 --> 01:33:45,036
[SPEAKER_13]: Go to the ones that are worse than hell.

1440
01:33:45,256 --> 01:33:46,937
[SPEAKER_13]: I want to see what the really bad ones are.

1441
01:33:46,957 --> 01:33:55,861
[SPEAKER_13]: If these are the bad ones... I used to listen to NSYNC when they were in Underground.

1442
01:33:59,304 --> 01:34:00,846
[SPEAKER_13]: You fucked my mother?

1443
01:34:01,206 --> 01:34:02,647
[SPEAKER_13]: I like that, even Jesus hates greed.

1444
01:34:02,667 --> 01:34:02,968
[SPEAKER_22]: That's great.

1445
01:34:02,988 --> 01:34:03,989
[SPEAKER_22]: Guns don't kill people.

1446
01:34:04,029 --> 01:34:05,530
[SPEAKER_22]: Mario Van Peebles!

1447
01:34:19,048 --> 01:34:19,729
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

1448
01:34:20,769 --> 01:34:22,130
[SPEAKER_13]: I like some of the... Hold on, hold on.

1449
01:34:22,510 --> 01:34:23,551
[SPEAKER_13]: I came on on the... Here, here.

1450
01:34:23,591 --> 01:34:25,052
[SPEAKER_13]: I want to see the really bad ones.

1451
01:34:25,072 --> 01:34:25,872
[SPEAKER_13]: I want to see the really bad ones.

1452
01:34:25,892 --> 01:34:27,393
[SPEAKER_13]: Because there's a section called Worse Than Hell.

1453
01:34:27,794 --> 01:34:28,574
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's look at these here.

1454
01:34:28,834 --> 01:34:29,455
[SPEAKER_13]: Ooh, it's purple.

1455
01:34:29,595 --> 01:34:31,916
[SPEAKER_13]: We do not condone purchasing these shirts.

1456
01:34:33,257 --> 01:34:35,058
[SPEAKER_13]: I swear, I didn't know she was three.

1457
01:34:37,480 --> 01:34:38,820
[SPEAKER_13]: I went to Washington, D.C.

1458
01:34:38,880 --> 01:34:40,902
[SPEAKER_13]: and all I got was shot by the sniper.

1459
01:34:48,829 --> 01:35:15,103
[SPEAKER_11]: I fucking hate, oh man, no way am I reading that one, I'll read it, I'll read it, I'll read it, no, no, no, no, no, no, there are some lines even this show can't cross, I'm sorry, Mary had a little lamb with the lamb humping Mary, that's great, here, here, please, hit control D,

1460
01:35:16,877 --> 01:35:18,958
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, that one's really bad, Loki.

1461
01:35:19,558 --> 01:35:21,559
[SPEAKER_13]: If you go to the site, you'll know which one we're talking about.

1462
01:35:21,619 --> 01:35:24,460
[SPEAKER_13]: It just starts with I hate dot dot dot and has this whole list.

1463
01:35:24,840 --> 01:35:25,621
[SPEAKER_13]: That's just too much.

1464
01:35:25,901 --> 01:35:27,541
[SPEAKER_13]: Although the punchline's really funny.

1465
01:35:29,002 --> 01:35:31,143
[SPEAKER_22]: I helped fund international terrorism.

1466
01:35:32,503 --> 01:35:33,224
[SPEAKER_13]: That's awful.

1467
01:35:34,804 --> 01:35:35,225
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh no.

1468
01:35:36,325 --> 01:35:37,605
[SPEAKER_21]: Abortions tickle.

1469
01:35:39,246 --> 01:35:40,327
[SPEAKER_13]: That's awful.

1470
01:35:41,427 --> 01:35:43,168
[SPEAKER_13]: There's just some awful shirts here.

1471
01:35:43,188 --> 01:35:43,748
[SPEAKER_13]: This is great.

1472
01:35:46,078 --> 01:35:47,299
[SPEAKER_13]: School Shootings Tour.

1473
01:35:47,319 --> 01:35:48,800
[SPEAKER_13]: It's got all this list.

1474
01:35:49,340 --> 01:35:50,121
[SPEAKER_13]: That's awful.

1475
01:35:52,122 --> 01:35:58,887
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh boy.

1476
01:36:01,629 --> 01:36:04,091
[SPEAKER_11]: The pictures on some of these are awful.

1477
01:36:05,211 --> 01:36:05,972
[SPEAKER_22]: I wouldn't wear that.

1478
01:36:09,846 --> 01:36:11,367
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm sorry, I think this one's funny.

1479
01:36:11,427 --> 01:36:12,928
[SPEAKER_13]: The one that says, I went to Washington, D.C.

1480
01:36:12,968 --> 01:36:14,969
[SPEAKER_13]: and all I got was shot by the sniper.

1481
01:36:15,869 --> 01:36:19,531
[SPEAKER_07]: Now that Jesus did it for the chicks one, I should buy that shirt and wear it to my old church.

1482
01:36:20,251 --> 01:36:21,512
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, my lord.

1483
01:36:22,612 --> 01:36:23,613
[SPEAKER_13]: One more time for you, Loki.

1484
01:36:31,396 --> 01:36:31,917
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

1485
01:36:32,437 --> 01:36:34,338
[SPEAKER_13]: This is, by the way, tshirthell.com.

1486
01:36:34,558 --> 01:36:36,819
[SPEAKER_13]: And we're looking at the worse than hell shirts right now.

1487
01:36:39,367 --> 01:36:40,650
[SPEAKER_13]: Thanks for watching!

1488
01:36:53,157 --> 01:36:54,618
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's see, I can kick your baby's ass.

1489
01:36:54,938 --> 01:36:55,538
[SPEAKER_13]: Potty head.

1490
01:36:56,158 --> 01:36:57,459
[SPEAKER_13]: I enjoy spanking.

1491
01:36:57,639 --> 01:36:58,619
[SPEAKER_13]: I enjoy good spanking.

1492
01:36:58,699 --> 01:36:59,440
[SPEAKER_13]: Smell my diaper.

1493
01:36:59,460 --> 01:37:00,900
[SPEAKER_09]: Fuck the milk, where's the whiskey tits?

1494
01:37:02,521 --> 01:37:04,302
[SPEAKER_13]: My IQ is higher than the president's.

1495
01:37:04,762 --> 01:37:07,343
[SPEAKER_10]: I shit my pants and all I got was a lousy t-shirt.

1496
01:37:07,363 --> 01:37:09,844
[SPEAKER_14]: That's awful!

1497
01:37:09,864 --> 01:37:13,306
[SPEAKER_14]: Are you kidding that?

1498
01:37:13,386 --> 01:37:14,146
[SPEAKER_14]: Are you my daddy?

1499
01:37:15,246 --> 01:37:17,207
[SPEAKER_14]: My pee-pee is bigger than yours.

1500
01:37:18,488 --> 01:37:20,169
[SPEAKER_10]: I hide in my crack in my diaper.

1501
01:37:21,329 --> 01:37:23,530
[SPEAKER_13]: You said I hide in my crack in my diaper?

1502
01:37:23,590 --> 01:37:24,991
[SPEAKER_10]: I hide my crack in my diaper.

1503
01:37:26,091 --> 01:37:27,111
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh my god.

1504
01:37:27,171 --> 01:37:28,312
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, alright, alright, alright.

1505
01:37:28,952 --> 01:37:30,113
[SPEAKER_13]: Enough of the t-shirt hell.

1506
01:37:30,833 --> 01:37:31,653
[SPEAKER_13]: What were we going to talk about?

1507
01:37:31,673 --> 01:37:33,494
[SPEAKER_13]: We wanted to talk about something when we came back?

1508
01:37:34,194 --> 01:37:35,775
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, you wanted to talk about some contests I did.

1509
01:37:35,795 --> 01:37:36,795
[SPEAKER_12]: Big Black Cock.

1510
01:37:36,815 --> 01:37:39,617
[SPEAKER_13]: But you want to talk about the contest now or are we going to wait until we wrap up the other contest?

1511
01:37:39,637 --> 01:37:41,617
[SPEAKER_13]: We're going to wrap up the other contest first though, right?

1512
01:37:41,637 --> 01:37:42,918
[SPEAKER_22]: We should start it next month, I think.

1513
01:37:43,058 --> 01:37:43,338
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright.

1514
01:37:44,178 --> 01:37:48,520
[SPEAKER_22]: We're going to have the remix challenge.

1515
01:37:48,860 --> 01:37:50,081
[SPEAKER_22]: Where we give you a song...

1516
01:37:51,698 --> 01:37:56,519
[SPEAKER_22]: and we give you a style and you need to remix the song in the style.

1517
01:37:57,639 --> 01:38:03,021
[SPEAKER_22]: And we will give points to people and we're going to have this running for a whole year.

1518
01:38:03,561 --> 01:38:05,441
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay, so we're going to hear all kinds of neat stuff.

1519
01:38:05,821 --> 01:38:09,502
[SPEAKER_22]: You have a month to finish your particular mix.

1520
01:38:09,542 --> 01:38:12,583
[SPEAKER_22]: Like the one, the last challenge that I gave out, we'll go ahead and extend it.

1521
01:38:12,983 --> 01:38:14,263
[SPEAKER_22]: The Safari Trance Mix.

1522
01:38:14,723 --> 01:38:15,043
[SPEAKER_11]: Sick.

1523
01:38:15,804 --> 01:38:17,784
[SPEAKER_22]: You know, we could do Remember Me, Happy Hardcore.

1524
01:38:20,455 --> 01:38:23,198
[SPEAKER_13]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1525
01:38:44,497 --> 01:38:46,538
[SPEAKER_22]: But, you know, we'll offer this.

1526
01:38:47,018 --> 01:38:49,960
[SPEAKER_22]: We're going to give out points based on how well your mix is.

1527
01:38:50,461 --> 01:38:55,244
[SPEAKER_22]: Whoever has the best, you know, the highest number of points at the end of the year gets a fabulous prize.

1528
01:38:55,324 --> 01:38:56,285
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm not talking about a shit prize.

1529
01:38:56,345 --> 01:38:57,906
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm talking about fabulous.

1530
01:38:58,546 --> 01:38:59,847
[SPEAKER_13]: We don't know what kind of fabulous prize.

1531
01:38:59,967 --> 01:39:01,729
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I mean, it is a year away.

1532
01:39:01,769 --> 01:39:08,353
[SPEAKER_10]: If we put up enough money, you can get one of those nice DJ-in-a-boxes for like $400 or $300, and it's got two turntables.

1533
01:39:08,893 --> 01:39:09,314
[SPEAKER_10]: Fuck that.

1534
01:39:09,354 --> 01:39:10,895
[SPEAKER_13]: If I'm buying one of those, I'm buying it for me.

1535
01:39:10,915 --> 01:39:10,995
[SPEAKER_13]: Sure.

1536
01:39:12,486 --> 01:39:14,547
[SPEAKER_13]: I was hoping it was going to be for me, but whatever, anyways.

1537
01:39:15,047 --> 01:39:15,227
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

1538
01:39:16,048 --> 01:39:19,170
[SPEAKER_12]: And even hosts can participate, because I'm grading.

1539
01:39:19,970 --> 01:39:21,291
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's all going to be Jamie grading?

1540
01:39:21,971 --> 01:39:22,931
[SPEAKER_13]: So I can enter the remixes?

1541
01:39:22,972 --> 01:39:23,952
[SPEAKER_22]: It'll be me and a panel.

1542
01:39:24,612 --> 01:39:25,513
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, you and a panel.

1543
01:39:26,093 --> 01:39:26,874
[SPEAKER_13]: A panel of what?

1544
01:39:28,775 --> 01:39:30,015
[SPEAKER_21]: Can you get negative scores?

1545
01:39:31,516 --> 01:39:32,596
[SPEAKER_21]: If it's really bad, yeah.

1546
01:39:33,017 --> 01:39:33,937
[SPEAKER_21]: If it's twin, yeah.

1547
01:39:34,417 --> 01:39:35,998
[SPEAKER_13]: I was waiting for someone to say that.

1548
01:39:37,259 --> 01:39:39,200
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll enter if you can get negative scores, because mine's so bad.

1549
01:39:40,382 --> 01:39:42,344
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know, I've heard pretty bad.

1550
01:39:42,804 --> 01:39:45,366
[SPEAKER_22]: But anyway, we'll start this up next month.

1551
01:39:46,346 --> 01:39:50,550
[SPEAKER_13]: But first, we've got to finish the rules for our DWI contest we're going to be doing.

1552
01:39:50,730 --> 01:39:51,951
[SPEAKER_13]: That's still going on too.

1553
01:39:52,011 --> 01:39:57,555
[SPEAKER_13]: That's still going on, but we really haven't announced the official rules because we've been lazy and out of town and what have you, drunk, whatever.

1554
01:39:58,655 --> 01:40:01,397
[SPEAKER_13]: But we'll have the full details on that next week, we swear.

1555
01:40:01,778 --> 01:40:07,442
[SPEAKER_13]: The DWI contest where all the DWIs must be to old school TV themes.

1556
01:40:07,742 --> 01:40:13,824
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes, no remixes, no movies, just TV themes.

1557
01:40:14,124 --> 01:40:15,425
[SPEAKER_13]: Didn't we say we were going to allow movies?

1558
01:40:15,725 --> 01:40:16,025
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know.

1559
01:40:16,225 --> 01:40:17,145
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, no movies.

1560
01:40:19,026 --> 01:40:20,446
[SPEAKER_13]: We'll have the full rules for you next week.

1561
01:40:20,907 --> 01:40:23,387
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm personally looking forward to seeing one done to the greatest American hero.

1562
01:40:24,728 --> 01:40:27,429
[SPEAKER_13]: Not that you're hinting what's going to get your vote.

1563
01:40:27,809 --> 01:40:28,009
[SPEAKER_22]: No.

1564
01:40:28,709 --> 01:40:29,670
[SPEAKER_22]: I just said I'm looking forward to it.

1565
01:40:29,690 --> 01:40:31,170
[SPEAKER_22]: It doesn't mean I'm actually going to vote for it.

1566
01:40:32,871 --> 01:40:33,611
[SPEAKER_22]: It should be excluded.

1567
01:40:34,291 --> 01:40:34,671
[SPEAKER_22]: Shut up.

1568
01:40:35,912 --> 01:40:36,492
[SPEAKER_22]: Shut up, intern.

1569
01:40:38,490 --> 01:40:39,070
[SPEAKER_22]: Shut up, intern.

1570
01:40:39,430 --> 01:40:41,331
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, so now Zero X is the official intern.

1571
01:40:41,431 --> 01:40:42,031
[SPEAKER_13]: He's our intern.

1572
01:40:42,111 --> 01:40:42,592
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, cool.

1573
01:40:43,132 --> 01:40:48,634
[SPEAKER_22]: Because Black Lab is, I'm sorry, Puppy, is our foreign correspondent from the People's Republic of Davis.

1574
01:40:48,654 --> 01:40:49,754
[SPEAKER_13]: He's also our PR bitch.

1575
01:40:50,094 --> 01:40:50,915
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes, our PR bitch.

1576
01:40:51,715 --> 01:40:53,596
[SPEAKER_13]: And so now we have Zero as our intern.

1577
01:40:53,636 --> 01:40:55,556
[SPEAKER_13]: Who else do we have to have a title on this show?

1578
01:40:55,576 --> 01:40:56,357
[SPEAKER_13]: Dave's our mascot.

1579
01:40:56,417 --> 01:40:57,257
[SPEAKER_13]: Dave's our mascot.

1580
01:40:58,537 --> 01:40:58,878
[SPEAKER_13]: Who else?

1581
01:41:00,538 --> 01:41:01,239
[SPEAKER_22]: What's Brad?

1582
01:41:01,439 --> 01:41:02,439
[SPEAKER_22]: Brad is the official Brad.

1583
01:41:05,700 --> 01:41:06,881
[SPEAKER_22]: Bradley is the official Bradley.

1584
01:41:08,573 --> 01:41:09,054
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, alright.

1585
01:41:11,156 --> 01:41:12,097
[SPEAKER_13]: We'll work on titles later.

1586
01:41:12,337 --> 01:41:14,379
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, oh yeah, JB is the SyFam horn.

1587
01:41:14,639 --> 01:41:15,600
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes, they're SyFam horns.

1588
01:41:16,838 --> 01:41:26,344
[SPEAKER_13]: Speaking of which, should we get into the cage match now, or do we want to do the second half of the... Okay, we'll do the cage match, then we'll come back and do the second half of the interviews while we tally the votes, maybe?

1589
01:41:27,184 --> 01:41:32,087
[SPEAKER_13]: Actually, no, wait, I still have to find that part in the tape, so it's going to be a little bit, but I'll do that during cage match.

1590
01:41:32,547 --> 01:41:34,268
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyway, okay, then we'll get into the cage match.

1591
01:41:34,889 --> 01:41:37,270
[SPEAKER_13]: Jamie, talk about the cage match, in case we have anyone new listening tonight.

1592
01:41:38,631 --> 01:41:41,873
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, we play songs, each of us picks one.

1593
01:41:42,871 --> 01:41:46,972
[SPEAKER_22]: Um, whichever one won last week, of course, the person who chose that song does not get to choose a new one.

1594
01:41:47,552 --> 01:41:52,014
[SPEAKER_22]: And you use the chat room and vote on what you think is best and it goes into rotation for a week.

1595
01:41:52,634 --> 01:41:54,614
[SPEAKER_13]: It goes into rotation during our Bomani Music Amore program.

1596
01:41:55,375 --> 01:41:55,615
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

1597
01:41:55,795 --> 01:41:57,315
[SPEAKER_13]: Always on this channel when we're not here.

1598
01:41:57,675 --> 01:41:58,576
[SPEAKER_22]: Unless I'm going live.

1599
01:41:59,496 --> 01:42:01,796
[SPEAKER_13]: Or I did a fuck-off this week for the first time in like two weeks.

1600
01:42:02,157 --> 01:42:03,277
[SPEAKER_22]: Ooh, a whole two weeks.

1601
01:42:03,297 --> 01:42:03,857
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, a whole two weeks.

1602
01:42:03,877 --> 01:42:05,257
[SPEAKER_22]: I was doing like two a week, wasn't I?

1603
01:42:05,778 --> 01:42:08,038
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, you were a fuck-off whore for a while.

1604
01:42:08,938 --> 01:42:09,559
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, yeah, yeah.

1605
01:42:09,579 --> 01:42:10,359
[SPEAKER_21]: Blink, blink, blink, blink.

1606
01:42:12,794 --> 01:42:14,035
[SPEAKER_13]: Last week on Orange Lounge Radio.

1607
01:42:14,155 --> 01:42:16,597
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, so let's get into the cage match.

1608
01:42:19,680 --> 01:42:26,846
[SPEAKER_13]: Last week on the cage match, actually two weeks ago, but you guys didn't do a cage match last week, I'm assuming?

1609
01:42:27,727 --> 01:42:27,767
[SPEAKER_13]: No.

1610
01:42:27,787 --> 01:42:28,808
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, so last time we did a cage match.

1611
01:42:29,028 --> 01:42:33,832
[SPEAKER_13]: So by default, the winner from two weeks ago won last week, just by default, so there was no cage match.

1612
01:42:33,873 --> 01:42:35,474
[SPEAKER_13]: So this is two weeks in a row now.

1613
01:42:36,815 --> 01:42:39,576
[SPEAKER_13]: This is two weeks in a row now, going for its third victory.

1614
01:42:39,616 --> 01:42:45,138
[SPEAKER_13]: And honestly, between you and me, I think this is going to be the first song that has to be retired after four weeks.

1615
01:42:45,278 --> 01:42:52,561
[SPEAKER_13]: I just think it's going to... Just because it happens to be a host involved with the creation of it, I don't think it's ever going to lose.

1616
01:42:52,681 --> 01:42:55,582
[SPEAKER_13]: But... Boost my ego some more.

1617
01:42:55,962 --> 01:42:56,442
[SPEAKER_13]: That's enough.

1618
01:42:56,982 --> 01:42:57,643
[SPEAKER_13]: You don't need no more.

1619
01:42:58,143 --> 01:43:00,744
[SPEAKER_13]: But we have some worthy challengers tonight.

1620
01:43:00,784 --> 01:43:01,264
[SPEAKER_13]: You know why?

1621
01:43:02,429 --> 01:43:03,710
[SPEAKER_13]: This is what we decided to do.

1622
01:43:04,030 --> 01:43:05,451
[SPEAKER_13]: I think Jamie did this too, right?

1623
01:43:05,731 --> 01:43:07,732
[SPEAKER_13]: We let other people pick our songs this week.

1624
01:43:08,852 --> 01:43:14,535
[SPEAKER_21]: Yep, so other people picked our songs for this week.

1625
01:43:14,926 --> 01:43:15,967
[SPEAKER_21]: He was right, I like it.

1626
01:43:43,985 --> 01:43:45,427
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, let's get into the cage match.

1627
01:43:46,048 --> 01:43:51,175
[SPEAKER_13]: Last week, two weeks ago's winner, this is Loki with the Legend of Trance.

1628
01:43:51,396 --> 01:43:52,617
[SPEAKER_13]: We're just going to play a small clip of it.

1629
01:45:06,602 --> 01:45:06,822
[SPEAKER_13]: ACID3PRO

1630
01:45:23,527 --> 01:45:28,009
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know, I don't know, I just want to make a remix or something, and I was like, yeah, I'll try that.

1631
01:45:28,589 --> 01:45:29,109
[SPEAKER_10]: I want a sip.

1632
01:45:29,209 --> 01:45:31,570
[SPEAKER_13]: I want a sip of it, because I haven't tried this yet.

1633
01:45:31,690 --> 01:45:34,151
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, so I don't know, it's just, I thought about doing that.

1634
01:45:34,291 --> 01:45:44,374
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm working on either, now I was trying to do a Dynamite Rave one, something like that, you know, something trancy, but it's just not, it's not very, it just doesn't work.

1635
01:45:44,394 --> 01:45:45,575
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not sounding too good.

1636
01:45:46,155 --> 01:45:48,796
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm looking at right now, probably going to be doing a, um,

1637
01:45:50,550 --> 01:45:54,934
[SPEAKER_10]: Dark Black Forest won, and there was another one I was looking at.

1638
01:45:55,034 --> 01:45:57,175
[SPEAKER_10]: I can't remember.

1639
01:45:57,196 --> 01:45:58,917
[SPEAKER_10]: Dark Black Forest was one of them, though, for sure.

1640
01:46:00,398 --> 01:46:04,081
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, next up, let's play my pick for this week.

1641
01:46:04,161 --> 01:46:09,966
[SPEAKER_13]: However, my pick is actually coming from someone else this week, because I knew nothing I picked was going to beat Loki's.

1642
01:46:10,566 --> 01:46:10,966
[SPEAKER_13]: Love of the Angel

1643
01:47:04,352 --> 01:47:14,694
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm missing love, believe me I'll be someone Wish you love me, oh baby girl Why you ask me to fall in love with you Take me to the soul, to the soul of the angel Like a blind light in my mind Take me my life, to the top to feel alright

1644
01:48:06,906 --> 01:48:07,787
Thank you for watching!

1645
01:48:34,761 --> 01:48:38,544
[SPEAKER_13]: Sorry about that, I was queuing up the second half of the interviews there.

1646
01:48:38,564 --> 01:48:40,465
[SPEAKER_13]: Sorry about that.

1647
01:48:40,645 --> 01:48:42,666
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, the interviews are all queued up now.

1648
01:48:42,767 --> 01:48:43,927
[SPEAKER_13]: We'll get to that after the game.

1649
01:48:43,947 --> 01:48:49,251
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, that was KK, Jungle Girls, I don't remember their full name.

1650
01:48:50,752 --> 01:48:51,693
[SPEAKER_13]: DJ Kong, thank you.

1651
01:48:52,253 --> 01:48:53,354
[SPEAKER_13]: King Kong and Jungle Girls.

1652
01:48:53,854 --> 01:48:54,895
[SPEAKER_13]: With Love of the Angels.

1653
01:48:55,475 --> 01:48:56,356
[SPEAKER_21]: The Jungle Girls.

1654
01:48:57,376 --> 01:48:59,298
[SPEAKER_13]: That wasn't a bad tune, I liked it.

1655
01:48:59,318 --> 01:49:00,839
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's go around and see everybody else's thoughts.

1656
01:49:00,859 --> 01:49:03,421
[SPEAKER_13]: Sorry, we had the music full volume there.

1657
01:49:03,441 --> 01:49:03,861
[SPEAKER_13]: Sorry about that.

1658
01:49:04,181 --> 01:49:05,903
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's go around and get everyone else's thoughts on that song.

1659
01:49:05,983 --> 01:49:09,946
[SPEAKER_13]: 80s fabulous, but not 80s fabulous enough.

1660
01:49:11,627 --> 01:49:13,769
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know, I give it like a 7.

1661
01:49:14,129 --> 01:49:19,753
[SPEAKER_13]: It was pretty good for what it was supposed to sound like, but it wasn't nothing that really caught my attention.

1662
01:49:26,215 --> 01:49:32,662
[SPEAKER_13]: I'd actually go ahead and give it an 8, because I think it would be a pretty decent DDR song.

1663
01:49:32,783 --> 01:49:33,924
[SPEAKER_13]: It would be pretty cool in DDR.

1664
01:49:34,544 --> 01:49:43,134
[SPEAKER_13]: And, you know, I have a feeling, just because there's some meanings behind this for some folks in the chatroom, there might be some votes coming this way for Love the Angels.

1665
01:49:43,174 --> 01:49:44,395
[SPEAKER_13]: So, who knows?

1666
01:49:47,092 --> 01:49:51,516
[SPEAKER_13]: I think they're trying everything they can to dethrone Legend of Trance.

1667
01:49:52,016 --> 01:49:52,737
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, oh.

1668
01:49:53,458 --> 01:49:54,539
[SPEAKER_13]: Jamie's going to bring it.

1669
01:49:54,779 --> 01:49:56,700
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, Jamie, what are you bringing to the cage match tonight?

1670
01:49:57,721 --> 01:50:02,525
[SPEAKER_22]: Alright, this was my favorite Belinda Carlyle song, Heaven is a Place on Earth.

1671
01:50:03,266 --> 01:50:04,947
[SPEAKER_22]: This is a remix by Wild Side.

1672
01:50:06,228 --> 01:50:09,231
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, this is Wild Side with Heaven is a Place on Earth.

1673
01:50:09,631 --> 01:50:12,333
[SPEAKER_13]: Jamie's pick for this week's cage match.

1674
01:50:12,413 --> 01:50:12,674
[SPEAKER_13]: Enjoy.

1675
01:50:13,800 --> 01:50:22,875
[SPEAKER_05]: Ooh, baby, do you know that's where Ooh, heaven is a place on earth This ain't heaven, love goes first We'll make heaven

1676
01:54:09,516 --> 01:54:11,822
Oh baby, do you know that's where Oh heaven is

1677
01:54:44,950 --> 01:54:46,752
[SPEAKER_13]: All righty, that's the last pick.

1678
01:54:47,993 --> 01:54:49,655
[SPEAKER_13]: Wild Side with Heaven is a Place on Earth.

1679
01:54:49,695 --> 01:54:51,116
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's go around and get your thoughts on that.

1680
01:54:51,156 --> 01:54:51,456
[SPEAKER_13]: Jamie!

1681
01:54:51,717 --> 01:54:52,017
[SPEAKER_21]: Ten.

1682
01:54:53,378 --> 01:54:54,619
[SPEAKER_13]: I give it a nine.

1683
01:54:56,261 --> 01:54:58,763
[SPEAKER_13]: I just like speed mixes, so I will give it a seven.

1684
01:54:59,344 --> 01:55:01,366
[SPEAKER_10]: But I have a DWI for it, so I give it a 7.5.

1685
01:55:04,656 --> 01:55:05,677
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, that was pretty good.

1686
01:55:05,717 --> 01:55:07,379
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm beginning to like Wildside a lot.

1687
01:55:07,459 --> 01:55:12,827
[SPEAKER_13]: If you didn't recognize the name at first, they're the same band that did Irresistible from DDR Extreme.

1688
01:55:12,847 --> 01:55:14,189
[SPEAKER_13]: They're pretty good.

1689
01:55:16,291 --> 01:55:18,835
[SPEAKER_13]: Now, see, yeah, so they're getting some good stuff.

1690
01:55:20,076 --> 01:55:21,017
[SPEAKER_13]: It was a pretty good mix.

1691
01:55:21,057 --> 01:55:21,497
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll give it an 8.

1692
01:55:22,077 --> 01:55:22,218
[SPEAKER_13]: 8 for 80.

1693
01:55:23,478 --> 01:55:23,518
[SPEAKER_13]: 80s.

1694
01:55:24,059 --> 01:55:25,500
[SPEAKER_13]: So, not too bad.

1695
01:55:26,420 --> 01:55:27,821
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, so here you go again.

1696
01:55:28,161 --> 01:55:30,082
[SPEAKER_13]: You can start sending your votes now.

1697
01:55:30,202 --> 01:55:33,404
[SPEAKER_13]: Send them over private message to Sky in the chatroom or over email.

1698
01:55:33,785 --> 01:55:35,486
[SPEAKER_13]: Here, once again, are your choices.

1699
01:55:35,586 --> 01:55:38,427
[SPEAKER_13]: Last week's winner, Legend of Trance by Loki.

1700
01:55:42,930 --> 01:55:45,171
[SPEAKER_13]: Or you can vote for Love of the Angel.

1701
01:55:52,492 --> 01:55:55,674
[SPEAKER_13]: Or you can vote for Wild Side with Heaven is a Place on Earth.

1702
01:56:03,638 --> 01:56:06,019
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, send those votes right now.

1703
01:56:06,700 --> 01:56:06,980
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright.

1704
01:56:08,461 --> 01:56:10,042
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, so there you go.

1705
01:56:10,982 --> 01:56:11,843
[SPEAKER_13]: But not the four with a rainbow.

1706
01:56:26,832 --> 01:56:28,573
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, Wendell's through the whole damn thing.

1707
01:56:28,633 --> 01:56:31,756
[SPEAKER_13]: If you listen to the special on Friday, Saturday, Wendell's in the whole damn thing.

1708
01:56:31,836 --> 01:56:35,058
[SPEAKER_13]: So he didn't need a special interview.

1709
01:56:35,338 --> 01:56:35,959
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, that was great.

1710
01:56:35,999 --> 01:56:37,660
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, hey, if you were... We were first.

1711
01:56:37,780 --> 01:56:40,722
[SPEAKER_13]: Just goes to show, we stay on top of shit.

1712
01:56:40,822 --> 01:56:47,527
[SPEAKER_13]: If you stay tuned into Orange Lounge and you're on the net, you're going to be the first to hear about all these news, especially when big tournaments are going on.

1713
01:56:48,148 --> 01:56:49,809
[SPEAKER_13]: Because we got you covered.

1714
01:56:49,989 --> 01:56:50,450
[SPEAKER_13]: We got you covered.

1715
01:56:50,470 --> 01:56:50,710
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

1716
01:56:51,851 --> 01:56:52,391
[SPEAKER_13]: Here we go.

1717
01:56:52,411 --> 01:56:53,532
[SPEAKER_13]: Second half of the interviews.

1718
01:56:54,577 --> 01:56:59,261
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, it's 5.47pm on Sunday, and they've just announced all the winners for freestyle.

1719
01:56:59,621 --> 01:57:04,705
[SPEAKER_13]: Taking home Max 2 Machine, Bruce Leroy, and lots of great routines.

1720
01:57:04,765 --> 01:57:06,686
[SPEAKER_13]: Honestly, any of these routines would have won a normal tournament.

1721
01:57:06,706 --> 01:57:10,429
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm going to go around and see if I can't get some reaction from some folks.

1722
01:57:10,990 --> 01:57:12,371
[SPEAKER_13]: We'll see what we can get here.

1723
01:57:15,041 --> 01:57:18,042
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm standing here with JP Money, who came in, I believe, 7th place, right, with his routine?

1724
01:57:18,443 --> 01:57:20,844
[SPEAKER_13]: Fabulous, fabulous ending to your routine, by the way, with all the money.

1725
01:57:20,864 --> 01:57:21,704
[SPEAKER_13]: Where'd that idea come from?

1726
01:57:22,064 --> 01:57:31,248
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, actually, that was brought to my attention by the minds of my, of my, uh, the people staying in the room, my roommates, there you go, that's what I was looking for.

1727
01:57:31,268 --> 01:57:34,129
[SPEAKER_07]: And I, you know, I thought it was pretty clever, so I'm like, you know, why not?

1728
01:57:35,030 --> 01:57:36,330
[SPEAKER_07]: So how did you feel about the tournament today?

1729
01:57:37,031 --> 01:57:40,172
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, man, everybody performed, performed really good.

1730
01:57:40,412 --> 01:57:42,473
[SPEAKER_07]: I was, I'm really happy with the way it turned out.

1731
01:57:43,249 --> 01:57:46,592
[SPEAKER_07]: and I'm happy that it ended on such a high note.

1732
01:57:46,612 --> 01:57:48,194
[SPEAKER_07]: How are you going to celebrate today?

1733
01:57:49,134 --> 01:57:49,655
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

1734
01:57:49,775 --> 01:57:51,296
[SPEAKER_07]: Me and my friends tonight are going to go somewhere.

1735
01:57:51,957 --> 01:57:55,980
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to hang, probably go crazy, just as we always do.

1736
01:57:56,641 --> 01:57:57,282
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, sounds good.

1737
01:57:57,302 --> 01:57:57,842
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for talking to us.

1738
01:57:58,242 --> 01:58:01,085
[SPEAKER_13]: Anything else you want to say?

1739
01:58:01,245 --> 01:58:01,765
[SPEAKER_13]: No, not really.

1740
01:58:01,906 --> 01:58:02,206
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1741
01:58:02,506 --> 01:58:02,886
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, cool.

1742
01:58:02,906 --> 01:58:03,007
[SPEAKER_13]: Later.

1743
01:58:03,147 --> 01:58:03,327
[SPEAKER_13]: Later.

1744
01:58:04,369 --> 01:58:07,030
[SPEAKER_13]: All right, I'm staying here with the AJ Sweet Banana, who's taking home third place.

1745
01:58:07,390 --> 01:58:08,031
[SPEAKER_13]: Awesome routine.

1746
01:58:08,071 --> 01:58:09,471
[SPEAKER_13]: Definitely would have been in my top three, too.

1747
01:58:09,691 --> 01:58:10,451
[SPEAKER_13]: How'd you feel about today?

1748
01:58:10,992 --> 01:58:11,332
[SPEAKER_13]: Pretty good.

1749
01:58:11,372 --> 01:58:15,053
[SPEAKER_07]: Not bad for a week's worth of procrastination, but yeah.

1750
01:58:15,113 --> 01:58:20,695
[SPEAKER_07]: Everything, a lot of stuff here will be on eBay eventually, because I have a lot of it at home, but yeah.

1751
01:58:20,976 --> 01:58:23,196
[SPEAKER_13]: It's okay, because it's cool, and I have Ikaruga.

1752
01:58:23,497 --> 01:58:27,298
[SPEAKER_13]: How did you exactly, now you kind of crammed two really awesome freestyle routines.

1753
01:58:27,318 --> 01:58:28,599
[SPEAKER_13]: How exactly did you go about cramming?

1754
01:58:28,619 --> 01:58:29,419
[SPEAKER_13]: Were you up all night, or...

1755
01:58:29,879 --> 01:58:33,301
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, yeah, six hours of sleep, woke up early at Godin's house over here.

1756
01:58:34,301 --> 01:58:36,703
[SPEAKER_07]: And, uh, yeah, practiced in his living room, that kind of thing.

1757
01:58:37,463 --> 01:58:39,784
[SPEAKER_07]: I forgot a few things, you'll probably see them on videos, but that's fine.

1758
01:58:39,844 --> 01:58:43,386
[SPEAKER_07]: It's all in the fun, it's all in the entertainment, it's all about the game, yeah.

1759
01:58:43,646 --> 01:58:44,307
[SPEAKER_07]: What's next for you?

1760
01:58:44,887 --> 01:58:52,831
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, a break for college, maybe do something for B3, the coming up tournament, and, uh, yeah, focus on school because I've got a psych test tomorrow.

1761
01:58:53,611 --> 01:58:56,213
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, crap, that's the one you ought to have been cramming for, huh?

1762
01:58:56,733 --> 01:59:00,315
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, and shout out to anyone who sees my iBook.

1763
01:59:00,855 --> 01:59:04,077
[SPEAKER_07]: It has been stolen, and yeah, I lost my iBook here.

1764
01:59:04,097 --> 01:59:07,099
[SPEAKER_07]: It's stolen from behind the pre-reg thing, but it's alright.

1765
01:59:07,479 --> 01:59:08,600
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I got something in return.

1766
01:59:08,800 --> 01:59:09,300
[SPEAKER_07]: It's all good.

1767
01:59:10,071 --> 01:59:12,331
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, alright, anything else you want to say to folks out there listening?

1768
01:59:12,711 --> 01:59:15,512
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, just, if you're playing the game, have fun, that's all there is to it.

1769
01:59:16,172 --> 01:59:17,852
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, thanks, have a good celebration tonight.

1770
01:59:18,032 --> 01:59:18,553
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, thanks.

1771
01:59:19,553 --> 01:59:21,373
[SPEAKER_13]: Does anyone know if AJ found his iBook?

1772
01:59:21,533 --> 01:59:26,274
[SPEAKER_13]: Let us know, we're curious, because that sucks to have stuff stolen.

1773
01:59:26,414 --> 01:59:27,134
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, that's ass.

1774
01:59:27,154 --> 01:59:27,854
[SPEAKER_13]: Bad people.

1775
01:59:28,754 --> 01:59:29,134
[SPEAKER_22]: Naughty.

1776
01:59:31,375 --> 01:59:33,115
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, now we're talking to the winner.

1777
01:59:33,555 --> 01:59:34,795
[SPEAKER_13]: Say hello to Bruce Leroy, everybody.

1778
01:59:35,295 --> 01:59:36,796
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey everybody, what's going on?

1779
01:59:37,516 --> 01:59:37,996
[SPEAKER_06]: How's it feel?

1780
01:59:38,576 --> 01:59:39,917
[SPEAKER_06]: Man, it feels amazing.

1781
01:59:39,957 --> 01:59:46,782
[SPEAKER_06]: I came out here and my first round was really kind of a disappointment for me.

1782
01:59:46,862 --> 01:59:48,463
[SPEAKER_06]: I kind of choked a little bit.

1783
01:59:49,464 --> 01:59:51,925
[SPEAKER_06]: I knew I just had to represent at this point.

1784
01:59:53,963 --> 01:59:54,864
[SPEAKER_06]: I had faith in this routine.

1785
01:59:54,884 --> 01:59:56,405
[SPEAKER_06]: Lookin' Up A Rock is a very fast song.

1786
01:59:56,885 --> 01:59:59,927
[SPEAKER_06]: It required a lot of dedication.

1787
01:59:59,967 --> 02:00:01,308
[SPEAKER_06]: It came through and it came together.

1788
02:00:01,628 --> 02:00:04,050
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't blank out like I did yesterday.

1789
02:00:05,150 --> 02:00:07,392
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank God for that.

1790
02:00:07,492 --> 02:00:08,593
[SPEAKER_06]: Everyone felt the moves.

1791
02:00:08,673 --> 02:00:09,373
[SPEAKER_06]: That was the main part.

1792
02:00:10,013 --> 02:00:10,754
[SPEAKER_06]: The crowd felt me.

1793
02:00:10,794 --> 02:00:15,437
[SPEAKER_06]: That was the main thing that put me over the edge.

1794
02:00:15,457 --> 02:00:18,399
[SPEAKER_06]: I filled the song, communicated with the song, and the song communicates through me.

1795
02:00:18,419 --> 02:00:20,120
[SPEAKER_06]: That's how I try to do it.

1796
02:00:20,260 --> 02:00:20,500
[SPEAKER_06]: Definitely.

1797
02:00:20,540 --> 02:00:21,000
[SPEAKER_13]: I totally agree.

1798
02:00:21,020 --> 02:00:23,182
[SPEAKER_13]: Was there anything you did to prepare for today's routine?

1799
02:00:23,922 --> 02:00:27,203
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, definitely, um, I watched, um, Sammy Davis Jr.

1800
02:00:27,223 --> 02:00:30,204
[SPEAKER_06]: was a tremendous influence, um, as was Fred Astaire and Gene Kelly.

1801
02:00:30,584 --> 02:00:33,305
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, I watched a lot of their footage, like, Singing in the Rain, stuff like that.

1802
02:00:34,005 --> 02:00:38,427
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, yeah, and then, you know, throwing in a bit of my own stuff, I really tried to feel the song, you know?

1803
02:00:38,827 --> 02:00:44,929
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of times people do routines, and they'll fight the song with their moves, and you gotta, you gotta let the song tell you what to do, so.

1804
02:00:45,289 --> 02:00:47,590
[SPEAKER_06]: Another question on everybody's mind, what the hell are you gonna do with that machine?

1805
02:00:48,740 --> 02:00:54,503
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to try my best to get it up to NorCal, put it in my apartment, and I'm telling you, one quarter for five songs, dude.

1806
02:00:54,583 --> 02:00:55,983
[SPEAKER_13]: You live upstairs or downstairs?

1807
02:00:56,003 --> 02:00:56,623
[SPEAKER_06]: I live upstairs.

1808
02:00:56,824 --> 02:00:57,344
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, shit.

1809
02:00:57,664 --> 02:01:04,086
[SPEAKER_06]: And the maintenance man lives above me, so he's going to be pissed off.

1810
02:01:04,147 --> 02:01:05,147
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right, dude.

1811
02:01:05,187 --> 02:01:10,069
[SPEAKER_06]: After I do something, I'll have to put a cushion under it or something, dude, because it's going to drive him crazy.

1812
02:01:10,249 --> 02:01:12,510
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, well, congratulations.

1813
02:01:12,550 --> 02:01:14,651
[SPEAKER_13]: Any other final thoughts going through your mind right now?

1814
02:01:14,671 --> 02:01:14,711
[SPEAKER_06]: Um...

1815
02:01:17,093 --> 02:01:18,354
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I thank everybody.

1816
02:01:18,814 --> 02:01:23,897
[SPEAKER_06]: It's all about the people that love me and accept me for who I am and what I do and what I dance.

1817
02:01:24,658 --> 02:01:27,960
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just entirely grateful, dude.

1818
02:01:28,480 --> 02:01:29,481
[SPEAKER_06]: Everybody loves Bruce Leroy.

1819
02:01:29,501 --> 02:01:30,221
[SPEAKER_06]: Give me a hug, Bruce Leroy.

1820
02:01:30,241 --> 02:01:31,022
[SPEAKER_06]: Give me a hug, baby.

1821
02:01:31,062 --> 02:01:31,922
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, yeah.

1822
02:01:32,523 --> 02:01:34,944
[SPEAKER_06]: Much love, yeah, yeah.

1823
02:01:37,145 --> 02:01:38,286
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, my God, yes.

1824
02:01:38,446 --> 02:01:39,467
[SPEAKER_13]: All right, we'll be back.

1825
02:01:41,973 --> 02:01:44,897
[SPEAKER_13]: All right, I'm sitting here with the Master42 who came in second place.

1826
02:01:45,337 --> 02:01:46,318
[SPEAKER_13]: How do you feel about today's tournament?

1827
02:01:46,639 --> 02:01:47,540
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, it was so much fun.

1828
02:01:47,600 --> 02:01:56,370
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just so glad that I got to compete here with everybody and got a chance for everyone to see the skills and just to portray.

1829
02:01:57,971 --> 02:01:59,891
[SPEAKER_09]: The event here is just so awesome.

1830
02:02:00,271 --> 02:02:04,012
[SPEAKER_09]: Everybody's tournament and their performance is just really, really strong.

1831
02:02:04,452 --> 02:02:06,312
[SPEAKER_13]: Now you decided to go a little OG with your routine.

1832
02:02:06,352 --> 02:02:07,433
[SPEAKER_13]: How did you go about picking your song?

1833
02:02:07,813 --> 02:02:17,594
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I remember when I first started learning about freestyling, I downloaded videos off the internet and I saw this group, this Korean group called A-Team, and they performed to this song.

1834
02:02:17,854 --> 02:02:20,035
[SPEAKER_09]: And I thought it was just the awesomest thing ever.

1835
02:02:20,175 --> 02:02:21,835
[SPEAKER_09]: I was like, oh my gosh, that's incredible.

1836
02:02:21,875 --> 02:02:23,495
[SPEAKER_09]: How did they do that?

1837
02:02:24,196 --> 02:02:26,836
[SPEAKER_13]: You and Master42, DarkSakura, could be great friends.

1838
02:02:28,016 --> 02:02:28,757
[SPEAKER_09]: Ah, classics.

1839
02:02:29,677 --> 02:02:34,620
[SPEAKER_13]: I actually incorporated one of their moves from that video, and I've just loved that song ever since.

1840
02:02:34,640 --> 02:02:36,522
[SPEAKER_13]: So what's going through your head right now?

1841
02:02:36,542 --> 02:02:38,043
[SPEAKER_13]: What are you going to do with the prize?

1842
02:02:38,563 --> 02:02:40,724
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm going to go home and play on it, dude.

1843
02:02:41,985 --> 02:02:50,951
[SPEAKER_09]: I had an American version of the PlayStation, and I actually tried to bring American DDR steps to play here, but I learned at the last moment that they wouldn't actually work.

1844
02:02:51,251 --> 02:02:53,593
[SPEAKER_09]: I needed a Japanese version of DDR.

1845
02:02:53,753 --> 02:02:56,735
[SPEAKER_09]: So now I have that, so now for the next tournament, I won't be in that same pickle.

1846
02:02:57,615 --> 02:02:58,435
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, so what's next for you?

1847
02:02:58,455 --> 02:02:59,195
[SPEAKER_13]: Are you going to be doing tournaments?

1848
02:02:59,215 --> 02:02:59,815
[SPEAKER_13]: Are you going to take a break?

1849
02:02:59,855 --> 02:03:00,716
[SPEAKER_13]: More tournaments in the future?

1850
02:03:00,976 --> 02:03:05,516
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I heard there's a tournament coming up in July that has a freestyle aspect, so I'm going to check that out.

1851
02:03:05,856 --> 02:03:09,297
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think it'll be as big as CyberZone, but it'll be something to look forward to.

1852
02:03:09,617 --> 02:03:09,957
[SPEAKER_09]: Sounds good.

1853
02:03:09,977 --> 02:03:12,058
[SPEAKER_09]: And how are you celebrating tonight?

1854
02:03:12,778 --> 02:03:19,099
[SPEAKER_13]: We speculate, by the way, that July tournament that Master42 references could possibly be actually a really big tournament.

1855
02:03:19,599 --> 02:03:22,399
[SPEAKER_22]: I think March Madness is going to be a qualifier.

1856
02:03:22,739 --> 02:03:24,820
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, this might be a big deal.

1857
02:03:25,120 --> 02:03:26,620
[SPEAKER_13]: More details to come on that one.

1858
02:03:27,463 --> 02:03:29,725
[SPEAKER_09]: Guys, we're going down to Roscoe's for chicken and waffles.

1859
02:03:29,865 --> 02:03:30,686
[SPEAKER_09]: Roscoe's!

1860
02:03:30,726 --> 02:03:33,107
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, that's right, that's right!

1861
02:03:33,168 --> 02:03:36,010
[SPEAKER_09]: We want, we want Roscoe's!

1862
02:03:36,710 --> 02:03:37,171
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah!

1863
02:03:37,691 --> 02:03:40,053
[SPEAKER_13]: So I think we're going to head down there for some chicken and waffles.

1864
02:03:40,353 --> 02:03:42,615
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, anything else you want to say to the fine folks listening?

1865
02:03:42,635 --> 02:03:45,457
[SPEAKER_09]: Just congratulations to everyone, and take up DDR.

1866
02:03:45,597 --> 02:03:48,439
[SPEAKER_09]: You might feel funky at first, but it's the best game in the world, man.

1867
02:03:48,520 --> 02:03:49,961
[SPEAKER_09]: It gets you laid like you can't believe.

1868
02:03:50,001 --> 02:03:50,961
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, totally, man.

1869
02:03:51,542 --> 02:03:52,202
[SPEAKER_09]: It does?

1870
02:03:52,563 --> 02:03:53,483
[SPEAKER_13]: What the hell am I doing wrong?

1871
02:03:55,723 --> 02:03:56,564
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright, thanks for talking to us.

1872
02:03:56,704 --> 02:03:57,564
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright, thanks a lot, man.

1873
02:03:58,405 --> 02:03:58,845
[SPEAKER_16]: Fucked up.

1874
02:03:59,686 --> 02:04:02,989
[SPEAKER_16]: And he forgot to have the third place match.

1875
02:04:03,009 --> 02:04:07,512
[SPEAKER_13]: Whoa, that went into Fremont interviews because I used the same tape there.

1876
02:04:08,073 --> 02:04:09,213
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, that was it.

1877
02:04:09,274 --> 02:04:11,996
[SPEAKER_13]: That was all the interviews that we did that night.

1878
02:04:12,596 --> 02:04:14,658
[SPEAKER_13]: And then right after that, we headed over to Roscoe's.

1879
02:04:15,018 --> 02:04:22,644
[SPEAKER_13]: And in the special, you're going to actually hear some stuff taped at Roscoe's, including you'll hear the waiter was in on their...

1880
02:04:23,004 --> 02:04:25,805
[SPEAKER_13]: and I believe, I don't remember if I got Wendell's speech or not.

1881
02:04:25,825 --> 02:04:30,147
[SPEAKER_13]: Wendell, we did a shot, we did maple syrup shots, basically.

1882
02:04:31,268 --> 02:04:33,589
[SPEAKER_13]: Us at our table, we did shots because the waiter gave us the idea.

1883
02:04:33,609 --> 02:04:35,750
[SPEAKER_13]: He was talking about crazy customers that did shots of it.

1884
02:04:36,030 --> 02:04:37,611
[SPEAKER_13]: We all did a shot and did a toast.

1885
02:04:37,911 --> 02:04:38,751
[SPEAKER_13]: It was a beautiful moment.

1886
02:04:38,871 --> 02:04:40,172
[SPEAKER_13]: Roscoe's was actually one of the highlights.

1887
02:04:40,192 --> 02:04:42,053
[SPEAKER_13]: Did it make you choke?

1888
02:04:42,093 --> 02:04:46,715
[SPEAKER_13]: No, it tasted like... Actually...

1889
02:04:47,616 --> 02:04:48,677
[SPEAKER_13]: The hell with the tournament!

1890
02:05:01,118 --> 02:05:02,259
[SPEAKER_22]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1891
02:05:21,816 --> 02:05:22,357
[SPEAKER_13]: Very cool.

1892
02:05:22,457 --> 02:05:23,017
[SPEAKER_22]: That was cool.

1893
02:05:23,077 --> 02:05:24,378
[SPEAKER_22]: And all the white faces.

1894
02:05:24,438 --> 02:05:26,320
[SPEAKER_13]: We literally took over like half of Roscoe's.

1895
02:05:26,360 --> 02:05:37,509
[SPEAKER_13]: We had all the people, because this was a Sunday night, we had all the people on the one side coming back from church, coming to get their grits and their greens, and then they had us, just crazy kids there.

1896
02:05:38,870 --> 02:05:39,731
[SPEAKER_13]: Are we going to go to a break?

1897
02:05:41,448 --> 02:05:45,714
[SPEAKER_13]: We're going to go to a break, and when we come back, we'll announce the winner of this week's cage match.

1898
02:05:46,575 --> 02:05:50,200
[SPEAKER_13]: And, yeah, won't that be exciting?

1899
02:05:51,822 --> 02:05:54,786
[SPEAKER_13]: Loki, say something to stretch time here while I load up something for the break.

1900
02:05:55,467 --> 02:05:56,128
[SPEAKER_13]: Say something.

1901
02:05:56,485 --> 02:05:56,986
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, something.

1902
02:05:58,408 --> 02:05:59,048
[SPEAKER_13]: Your mom.

1903
02:06:00,590 --> 02:06:03,975
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, we'll play the song that won the tournament.

1904
02:06:04,295 --> 02:06:06,638
[SPEAKER_13]: Bruce Leroy used this song for his routine at Rules.

1905
02:06:08,040 --> 02:06:09,241
[SPEAKER_13]: Great, great routine.

1906
02:06:09,261 --> 02:06:10,603
[SPEAKER_13]: Manika Niko Rock.

1907
02:06:10,663 --> 02:06:10,903
[SPEAKER_13]: Enjoy.

1908
02:10:41,428 --> 02:10:46,270
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, if you didn't recognize those, those were the top three freestyle songs right there.

1909
02:10:46,391 --> 02:10:50,613
[SPEAKER_13]: First place was Manic Ningo Rock, second place was Brilliant to Your Orchestral Groove, and third place was Let's Get Down.

1910
02:10:50,653 --> 02:10:53,894
[SPEAKER_13]: Those were the songs that the folks did their routines to in one cyberbeat.

1911
02:10:53,914 --> 02:10:55,535
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, we're going to take things in a different direction now.

1912
02:10:55,555 --> 02:10:58,136
[SPEAKER_13]: We're going to play a song from Dance Mania EX2.

1913
02:10:58,176 --> 02:11:00,998
[SPEAKER_13]: This is an interesting trance cover of your song.

1914
02:11:01,378 --> 02:11:02,519
[SPEAKER_13]: Let us know what you think of this.

1915
02:11:02,539 --> 02:11:03,079
[SPEAKER_13]: This is interesting.

1916
02:11:03,359 --> 02:11:07,661
[SPEAKER_13]: When we come back, we're going to announce the winner of the cage match and this week's list list.

1917
02:11:08,201 --> 02:11:09,202
[SPEAKER_13]: It's going to be cool.

1918
02:11:39,447 --> 02:11:40,071
Thanks for watching!

1919
02:15:32,386 --> 02:15:37,190
[SPEAKER_03]: From StepSquad to Orange Labs, this PDR sucks!

1920
02:15:37,551 --> 02:15:37,871
[SPEAKER_03]: Holla!

1921
02:15:37,891 --> 02:15:38,091
[SPEAKER_03]: P.S.

1922
02:15:38,111 --> 02:15:38,532
[SPEAKER_03]: TTPO

1923
02:15:47,442 --> 02:15:54,893
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, that was Obsession from Dance Mania EX2 with your song.

1924
02:15:54,913 --> 02:15:57,577
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think Jamie just about vomited during that.

1925
02:15:58,638 --> 02:15:59,319
[SPEAKER_22]: I tried to ignore it.

1926
02:15:59,359 --> 02:15:59,960
[SPEAKER_22]: I blocked it out.

1927
02:16:01,262 --> 02:16:02,784
[SPEAKER_22]: We were looking at my afterburner.

1928
02:16:03,084 --> 02:16:05,004
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1929
02:16:30,322 --> 02:16:30,782
[SPEAKER_22]: Hey!

1930
02:16:32,043 --> 02:16:32,683
[SPEAKER_22]: My foot wins.

1931
02:16:32,823 --> 02:16:38,106
[SPEAKER_13]: Now, you guys, I have to admit, I think a lot of you... We got way less votes than we usually do this week.

1932
02:16:38,126 --> 02:16:39,107
[SPEAKER_13]: I think just zero wins.

1933
02:16:39,127 --> 02:16:39,767
[SPEAKER_21]: I vote for zero.

1934
02:16:39,827 --> 02:16:40,508
[SPEAKER_13]: We vote for zero.

1935
02:16:40,808 --> 02:16:45,690
[SPEAKER_13]: I got way less votes than I usually do for Cage Match, but you know, it just happens sometimes.

1936
02:16:45,911 --> 02:16:48,652
[SPEAKER_13]: And I begged, I pleaded, but we got all the votes.

1937
02:16:48,772 --> 02:16:50,433
[SPEAKER_21]: I didn't even pay attention to you adding them up.

1938
02:16:50,933 --> 02:16:55,816
[SPEAKER_13]: And so, yeah, I know this is actually going to be a surprise to everyone, but folks, we added up the votes.

1939
02:16:56,176 --> 02:16:56,857
[SPEAKER_13]: And the winner...

1940
02:16:57,937 --> 02:16:59,538
[SPEAKER_13]: is a little bit surprising.

1941
02:17:00,658 --> 02:17:05,479
[SPEAKER_13]: The winner, you guys, is Wild Side with Heaven is a Place on Earth.

1942
02:17:06,060 --> 02:17:09,101
[SPEAKER_04]: I love all of you.

1943
02:17:10,481 --> 02:17:13,002
[SPEAKER_04]: I love all of you.

1944
02:17:13,262 --> 02:17:23,305
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd like to dedicate this victory to all the little people that stepped on all the waves.

1945
02:17:23,385 --> 02:17:24,145
[SPEAKER_11]: That's the winner.

1946
02:17:25,166 --> 02:17:26,446
[SPEAKER_11]: I begged for votes.

1947
02:17:29,076 --> 02:17:31,078
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, so it was a close one, though.

1948
02:17:31,699 --> 02:17:35,943
[SPEAKER_13]: And, uh, funny enough, Loki, Loki, I thought it was gonna be the whole month.

1949
02:17:36,383 --> 02:17:38,205
[SPEAKER_13]: You came in dead last in that vote.

1950
02:17:38,225 --> 02:17:38,886
Sorry.

1951
02:17:38,946 --> 02:17:40,828
[SPEAKER_09]: There's only seven people that voted.

1952
02:17:42,249 --> 02:17:43,170
[SPEAKER_13]: Where is everybody?

1953
02:17:43,551 --> 02:17:44,431
[SPEAKER_13]: That's what I wanna know.

1954
02:17:45,913 --> 02:17:47,134
[SPEAKER_13]: Don't know, don't know what to tell ya.

1955
02:17:47,414 --> 02:17:50,598
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, so, uh, but Loki, you know what that means?

1956
02:17:51,418 --> 02:17:52,880
[SPEAKER_13]: That means you just gotta go make another remix.

1957
02:17:55,009 --> 02:17:56,750
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know what I was going to do anyways.

1958
02:17:56,891 --> 02:17:59,874
[SPEAKER_22]: You should do a 5-1-1 speed mix.

1959
02:18:01,236 --> 02:18:01,556
[SPEAKER_13]: Uh, no.

1960
02:18:04,720 --> 02:18:05,761
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, there it is.

1961
02:18:05,921 --> 02:18:06,822
[SPEAKER_13]: Winner of the cage match.

1962
02:18:07,262 --> 02:18:08,844
[SPEAKER_13]: Wild side, heaven has placed on earth.

1963
02:18:08,944 --> 02:18:09,305
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

1964
02:18:10,777 --> 02:18:13,059
[SPEAKER_13]: Now we're going to do a segment on this show, you know it, you love it.

1965
02:18:13,099 --> 02:18:18,984
[SPEAKER_13]: We do it damn near every week, but god damn it, it's just so popular, so much fun to do, we're doing it again.

1966
02:18:20,866 --> 02:18:22,307
[SPEAKER_13]: Listless, ladies and gentlemen.

1967
02:18:22,848 --> 02:18:26,551
[SPEAKER_13]: Tonight's topic... Loki, tell us the topic for tonight.

1968
02:18:27,692 --> 02:18:29,834
[SPEAKER_14]: It's the best 8-bit Nintendo game.

1969
02:18:30,975 --> 02:18:31,996
[SPEAKER_22]: Yay!

1970
02:18:32,016 --> 02:18:33,117
[SPEAKER_22]: Squee!

1971
02:18:33,137 --> 02:18:35,699
[SPEAKER_22]: Remember, this is NES, not Game Boy.

1972
02:18:36,838 --> 02:18:37,779
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, NES only.

1973
02:18:37,799 --> 02:18:39,279
[SPEAKER_13]: 8-bit Nintendo games only.

1974
02:18:39,459 --> 02:18:39,739
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

1975
02:18:39,940 --> 02:18:45,622
[SPEAKER_09]: Since every serious gamer knows the Nintendo was the only system that mattered and still does matter.

1976
02:18:47,543 --> 02:18:48,223
[SPEAKER_22]: I beg to differ.

1977
02:18:48,263 --> 02:18:50,004
[SPEAKER_22]: The Sega Master System was pretty fabulous.

1978
02:18:50,044 --> 02:18:51,085
[SPEAKER_22]: It had some of the best games.

1979
02:18:52,465 --> 02:18:53,466
[SPEAKER_22]: We were both saying this.

1980
02:18:53,506 --> 02:18:55,867
[SPEAKER_22]: They had the best version of Fantasy Zone.

1981
02:18:56,556 --> 02:19:03,202
[SPEAKER_13]: Fantasy Zone, if you have never played it, emulate it, find somebody who has it, and just sit in front of the TV for an hour and play it, and you'll love it.

1982
02:19:03,642 --> 02:19:06,965
[SPEAKER_22]: And if you've ever played Samba de Amigo, it has the Opa Opa song.

1983
02:19:10,528 --> 02:19:18,875
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, no, but also, for anyone who's ever seen my quote on my banner on DDR Freak and the one I used to have on Sack of Remani, it's, welcome to the Fantasy Zone.

1984
02:19:19,015 --> 02:19:20,316
[SPEAKER_22]: Get ready.

1985
02:19:20,516 --> 02:19:21,577
[SPEAKER_22]: We all know what game that came from.

1986
02:19:22,258 --> 02:19:22,738
Um...

1987
02:19:27,455 --> 02:19:31,560
[SPEAKER_22]: Space Harrier, because Space Harrier was in the Fantasy Zone, as in from the old game.

1988
02:19:31,940 --> 02:19:34,683
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh my gosh, I forgot about that, because I haven't played that game in so long.

1989
02:19:34,823 --> 02:19:37,446
[SPEAKER_22]: Why else do you think the whole game was pastel with a checkered floor?

1990
02:19:38,668 --> 02:19:38,888
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay.

1991
02:19:40,313 --> 02:19:41,134
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, here we go.

1992
02:19:41,174 --> 02:19:42,535
[SPEAKER_13]: Who's going to start us off tonight?

1993
02:19:43,216 --> 02:19:43,416
[SPEAKER_13]: You.

1994
02:19:44,017 --> 02:19:44,277
[SPEAKER_13]: Me?

1995
02:19:44,537 --> 02:19:45,178
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, I'll start.

1996
02:19:46,019 --> 02:19:54,327
[SPEAKER_13]: My pick for best 8-bit Nintendo game ever is a little weird, but you've got to represent, you've got to know your roots.

1997
02:19:54,508 --> 02:19:55,589
[SPEAKER_13]: You have to know your roots.

1998
02:19:56,310 --> 02:20:00,414
[SPEAKER_13]: My number three pick for best Nintendo game ever is Dance Aerobics.

1999
02:20:01,738 --> 02:20:02,118
[SPEAKER_22]: Freak.

2000
02:20:03,199 --> 02:20:06,400
[SPEAKER_22]: You know, when you said going back to your roots, I was thinking that you were going to start playing RuPaul.

2001
02:20:06,840 --> 02:20:07,000
[SPEAKER_13]: No.

2002
02:20:08,120 --> 02:20:09,121
[SPEAKER_13]: You better work.

2003
02:20:09,481 --> 02:20:10,181
[SPEAKER_13]: Cover girl.

2004
02:20:11,342 --> 02:20:11,502
[SPEAKER_13]: No.

2005
02:20:11,642 --> 02:20:13,002
[SPEAKER_22]: RuPaul did a song called Back to My Roots.

2006
02:20:13,262 --> 02:20:13,622
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, really?

2007
02:20:13,783 --> 02:20:14,583
[SPEAKER_13]: About getting hairdressed.

2008
02:20:14,983 --> 02:20:15,243
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, no.

2009
02:20:15,283 --> 02:20:16,904
[SPEAKER_13]: I only know the Supermodel song.

2010
02:20:16,924 --> 02:20:17,884
[SPEAKER_13]: Sorry.

2011
02:20:17,964 --> 02:20:22,506
[SPEAKER_13]: Dance Aerobics is my number three pick simply because DDR is a complete ripoff of Dance Aerobics.

2012
02:20:24,750 --> 02:20:26,251
[SPEAKER_13]: I have one pick.

2013
02:20:26,271 --> 02:20:32,337
[SPEAKER_09]: My number three pick... Now keep in mind it only came out in Japan, but because it was on the Famicom it counts.

2014
02:20:32,357 --> 02:20:32,797
[SPEAKER_07]: Kid Dracula!

2015
02:20:32,817 --> 02:20:38,502
[SPEAKER_13]: And you can download the emulator in the ROM!

2016
02:20:52,813 --> 02:20:54,675
[SPEAKER_13]: Kid Dracula is Jamie's number three pick.

2017
02:20:57,239 --> 02:20:57,719
[SPEAKER_07]: Zero.

2018
02:20:58,200 --> 02:20:59,982
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, my number three was Hogan's Alley.

2019
02:21:01,183 --> 02:21:01,984
[SPEAKER_07]: Hogan's Alley.

2020
02:21:02,705 --> 02:21:10,074
[SPEAKER_09]: That was the first game where you could actually shoot innocent people if you got really bored of trying to shoot the little spinny flipping board evil guys.

2021
02:21:12,200 --> 02:21:12,680
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, Huzz?

2022
02:21:13,601 --> 02:21:14,561
[SPEAKER_09]: That is so cool, though.

2023
02:21:14,761 --> 02:21:22,345
[SPEAKER_13]: Hogan's Alley, and already the chatroom is going crazy saying all these games have to be mentioned, and I already know none of them are gonna get mentioned.

2024
02:21:23,105 --> 02:21:25,526
[SPEAKER_13]: Just because our picks are off the wall, I know these people.

2025
02:21:25,566 --> 02:21:27,047
[SPEAKER_14]: We gotta go back to our roots here.

2026
02:21:27,067 --> 02:21:27,627
[SPEAKER_14]: Uh-oh.

2027
02:21:28,048 --> 02:21:32,350
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, we're going with the best all-time fucking game ever, Contra.

2028
02:21:33,270 --> 02:21:34,110
[SPEAKER_10]: Contra!

2029
02:21:36,592 --> 02:21:39,493
[SPEAKER_22]: But no way, the Japanese version was better because the trees moved.

2030
02:21:41,092 --> 02:21:41,492
[SPEAKER_22]: I hate you.

2031
02:21:41,532 --> 02:21:46,715
[SPEAKER_13]: That was my number two pick.

2032
02:22:07,686 --> 02:22:08,287
[SPEAKER_13]: was it really?

2033
02:22:08,708 --> 02:22:15,341
[SPEAKER_13]: uh oh alright Mega Man 2 was my second favorite but you can take a suggestion from the chat room there's plenty of suggestions if you want to see that

2034
02:22:19,565 --> 02:22:21,107
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, then Mega Man 2.

2035
02:22:21,647 --> 02:22:26,992
[SPEAKER_13]: The reason why I say Mega Man 2 and not Mega Man 1, just because I think the series... Mega Man 2 was the top of the series.

2036
02:22:27,393 --> 02:22:29,114
[SPEAKER_13]: Mega Man 2 was when it really started to take off.

2037
02:22:29,174 --> 02:22:33,879
[SPEAKER_13]: That's really the one that everybody, you know, all the other Mega Mans were a rip-off of, was Mega Man 2.

2038
02:22:33,919 --> 02:22:34,680
[SPEAKER_21]: Two words.

2039
02:22:35,380 --> 02:22:35,901
[SPEAKER_21]: Two words.

2040
02:22:36,161 --> 02:22:36,702
[SPEAKER_13]: Big shades.

2041
02:22:36,722 --> 02:22:37,482
[SPEAKER_13]: Metal blades.

2042
02:22:37,783 --> 02:22:38,523
[SPEAKER_13]: Metal blades.

2043
02:22:39,765 --> 02:22:41,747
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, Mega Man 2 is my number two pick.

2044
02:22:42,027 --> 02:22:43,048
[SPEAKER_13]: Jamie, what's your number two pick?

2045
02:22:44,474 --> 02:22:47,535
[SPEAKER_22]: I would shoot myself if I didn't mention it since you took my number two favorite.

2046
02:22:48,055 --> 02:22:48,615
[SPEAKER_22]: Legend of Zelda.

2047
02:22:49,515 --> 02:22:52,076
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, going to just what you know, The Legend of Zelda.

2048
02:22:52,096 --> 02:22:55,217
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a very popular game.

2049
02:22:56,037 --> 02:22:56,957
[SPEAKER_22]: Because I hated Zelda 2.

2050
02:22:58,797 --> 02:23:01,438
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, a lot of the chat room would agree with you with it.

2051
02:23:01,798 --> 02:23:02,078
[SPEAKER_13]: Really.

2052
02:23:02,538 --> 02:23:03,258
[SPEAKER_13]: I like Zelda 2.

2053
02:23:03,478 --> 02:23:04,159
[SPEAKER_13]: I appreciate Zelda 2.

2054
02:23:04,199 --> 02:23:08,980
[SPEAKER_22]: Zelda 2 is more like playing an RPG, but The Legend of Zelda was just like, oh my god.

2055
02:23:09,540 --> 02:23:13,861
[SPEAKER_22]: You know, and I would actually have almost mentioned Metroid, except I suck at Metroid, so Zelda.

2056
02:23:14,716 --> 02:23:17,678
[SPEAKER_13]: And you know, I like Zelda 2 a lot.

2057
02:23:17,698 --> 02:23:19,660
[SPEAKER_13]: What's funny is that Nintendo sequels kind of did that.

2058
02:23:19,680 --> 02:23:20,620
[SPEAKER_13]: You had Mario Bros.

2059
02:23:20,841 --> 02:23:22,262
[SPEAKER_13]: 2, it was completely different than Mario Bros.

2060
02:23:22,282 --> 02:23:22,262
1.

2061
02:23:22,302 --> 02:23:24,203
[SPEAKER_13]: Zelda 2 wasn't even a Mario game.

2062
02:23:24,223 --> 02:23:25,464
[SPEAKER_13]: I know, I know it wasn't a Mario game.

2063
02:23:25,484 --> 02:23:28,326
[SPEAKER_09]: Zelda 2, okay, his sword was like a little dagger.

2064
02:23:29,047 --> 02:23:30,528
[SPEAKER_09]: It was like, it was pathetic.

2065
02:23:30,968 --> 02:23:32,169
[SPEAKER_14]: Pathetic dagger.

2066
02:23:32,749 --> 02:23:34,952
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean, I think he's like, I'm Polkino with the dagger!

2067
02:23:35,192 --> 02:23:36,013
[SPEAKER_22]: Polkino with the dagger!

2068
02:23:36,073 --> 02:23:42,560
[SPEAKER_22]: Although I did like that in Super Smash Bros., they gave him his Zelda 2 moves, which made more sense for a fighting game.

2069
02:23:43,281 --> 02:23:46,324
[SPEAKER_22]: Dude, in Zelda 2, his sword looked like a penis.

2070
02:23:46,344 --> 02:23:47,545
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah!

2071
02:23:48,266 --> 02:23:50,869
[SPEAKER_13]: My number two, it wasn't really popular, but Arkanoid

2072
02:24:08,049 --> 02:24:08,829
[SPEAKER_09]: Arkanoid!

2073
02:24:09,650 --> 02:24:12,212
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, Breakout also.

2074
02:24:12,612 --> 02:24:18,877
[SPEAKER_09]: It was the most redundant game in the world, and you got really pissed off when you couldn't pass the third level and had to start all over again.

2075
02:24:18,897 --> 02:24:22,700
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, but at least the Nintendo one was a little more colorful, though.

2076
02:24:22,720 --> 02:24:23,920
[SPEAKER_22]: That's what's best in Out of the Clean Area.

2077
02:24:35,225 --> 02:24:36,585
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm a master on Destructo Match now.

2078
02:24:36,645 --> 02:24:37,746
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyway, we'll talk Neopets later.

2079
02:24:38,846 --> 02:24:42,246
[SPEAKER_13]: I want to talk about Waste of Time websites at the end of the show, because we have some new ones coming up this week.

2080
02:24:43,247 --> 02:24:44,927
[SPEAKER_09]: Time to bring out the big guns.

2081
02:24:45,487 --> 02:24:47,287
[SPEAKER_09]: Castlevania 2, Simon's Quest.

2082
02:24:47,567 --> 02:24:48,047
[SPEAKER_13]: Excellent.

2083
02:24:48,507 --> 02:24:48,868
[SPEAKER_13]: Excellent.

2084
02:24:48,888 --> 02:24:52,988
[SPEAKER_13]: The only Castlevania... No, not the only Castlevania matters, because we have the whole Dracula X series.

2085
02:24:53,528 --> 02:24:57,689
[SPEAKER_09]: Simon was the hero of all the Belmonts and the non-Belmonts.

2086
02:24:58,049 --> 02:25:03,290
[SPEAKER_22]: You know what just pissed me off is the fact that with the Captain N cartoon, they made Simon Belmont into this pretentious asshole.

2087
02:25:06,910 --> 02:25:18,317
[SPEAKER_22]: Don't let me forget to get you a ROM of Konami World for the Famicom, because there's a Castlevania 2 level in it.

2088
02:25:20,298 --> 02:25:24,120
[SPEAKER_22]: The Konami World games are winner, but they're too obscure for anyone to know anything about.

2089
02:25:27,935 --> 02:25:28,616
[SPEAKER_13]: All right, moving on.

2090
02:25:28,676 --> 02:25:30,179
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, now we got the number one choice.

2091
02:25:30,659 --> 02:25:35,427
[SPEAKER_13]: My number one choice for greatest 8-bit Nintendo game ever, Blaster Master.

2092
02:25:37,670 --> 02:25:39,192
[SPEAKER_22]: We all know the grenade trick, don't we?

2093
02:25:40,414 --> 02:25:41,196
[SPEAKER_13]: Absolutely.

2094
02:25:41,954 --> 02:25:44,617
[SPEAKER_13]: The sequels to Blaster Master, they don't exist to me.

2095
02:25:44,657 --> 02:25:45,458
[SPEAKER_13]: They are ass.

2096
02:25:45,999 --> 02:25:50,825
[SPEAKER_13]: Somebody needs to make a really good sequel to Blaster Master that plays just like the original.

2097
02:25:51,025 --> 02:25:52,768
[SPEAKER_13]: That game was the shit.

2098
02:25:52,968 --> 02:25:53,428
[SPEAKER_13]: The end.

2099
02:25:54,410 --> 02:25:56,212
[SPEAKER_22]: Although it technically... We know who should do it.

2100
02:25:56,712 --> 02:25:57,213
[SPEAKER_22]: Treasure.

2101
02:25:57,954 --> 02:25:59,416
[SPEAKER_22]: And they should do it like the way they did Bungaio.

2102
02:25:59,918 --> 02:26:00,938
[SPEAKER_13]: I have no idea what that is.

2103
02:26:01,779 --> 02:26:02,699
[SPEAKER_22]: You don't know what Treasure is?

2104
02:26:02,939 --> 02:26:03,559
[SPEAKER_13]: I've never played it.

2105
02:26:03,620 --> 02:26:07,061
[SPEAKER_22]: Treasure is the best video game manufacturing group ever.

2106
02:26:07,541 --> 02:26:08,762
[SPEAKER_22]: They did Gunstar Heroes.

2107
02:26:09,422 --> 02:26:09,722
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, okay.

2108
02:26:09,902 --> 02:26:11,823
[SPEAKER_22]: They did Radiant Silvergun.

2109
02:26:12,283 --> 02:26:12,983
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, okay, yeah, okay.

2110
02:26:13,003 --> 02:26:15,004
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, you should have just said the people that did Radiant Silvergun.

2111
02:26:15,024 --> 02:26:15,504
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know.

2112
02:26:15,884 --> 02:26:16,405
[SPEAKER_21]: Treasure.

2113
02:26:16,885 --> 02:26:17,485
[SPEAKER_21]: Treasure.

2114
02:26:17,785 --> 02:26:18,445
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, no, whoosh.

2115
02:26:18,666 --> 02:26:18,906
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, well.

2116
02:26:19,146 --> 02:26:28,930
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, but technically, actually, I just have to say is that my number one would really be the same thing that Jamie's putting for her number one, but I already knew she was going to put it, so I didn't have to, so I said something else.

2117
02:26:29,270 --> 02:26:29,510
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

2118
02:26:30,441 --> 02:26:31,862
[SPEAKER_22]: Guardian Legend, fuck yeah.

2119
02:26:31,902 --> 02:26:33,202
[SPEAKER_13]: The Guardian Legend!

2120
02:26:33,803 --> 02:26:34,803
[SPEAKER_22]: Best game ever.

2121
02:26:36,044 --> 02:26:42,407
[SPEAKER_09]: Tonight was like my first time seeing that game, and I saw like five minutes of it, and I think it was one of the coolest games ever.

2122
02:26:42,807 --> 02:26:44,889
[SPEAKER_13]: A lot of people don't know about the Guardian Legend.

2123
02:26:44,929 --> 02:26:45,849
[SPEAKER_13]: Tell Jamie, Jamie, tell them.

2124
02:26:45,889 --> 02:26:46,870
[SPEAKER_13]: It has Lola Lala Lala in it.

2125
02:26:46,970 --> 02:26:49,251
[SPEAKER_13]: I know, but tell them about the Guardian Legend, how it works.

2126
02:26:49,271 --> 02:26:53,333
[SPEAKER_22]: Guardian Legend is a combination shooting game, adventure game.

2127
02:26:55,014 --> 02:26:56,955
[SPEAKER_22]: Like, yeah, shooting, oh god.

2128
02:26:57,515 --> 02:26:58,736
[SPEAKER_22]: If you thought R-Type was hard...

2129
02:27:00,774 --> 02:27:01,555
[SPEAKER_22]: Thanks for watching!

2130
02:27:17,956 --> 02:27:32,001
[SPEAKER_22]: Guardian Legend, you know, you start off flying your way into this planet, and the planet is this whole mechanized planet, and then you run around, and by the way, it's a girl, which is cool, and you run around, and you shoot things, and you find weapons, and you go, you actually gain levels.

2131
02:27:32,601 --> 02:27:34,081
[SPEAKER_22]: You find ships, and you gain levels.

2132
02:27:34,141 --> 02:27:37,623
[SPEAKER_22]: The more things you kill, the higher levels you get, so it has the RPG element in it, too.

2133
02:27:38,303 --> 02:27:42,844
[SPEAKER_22]: And by the way, you find little shops with these blue aliens, and it's Lolo and Lala from Adventures of Lolo.

2134
02:27:44,465 --> 02:27:45,045
[SPEAKER_22]: And, you know,

2135
02:27:45,754 --> 02:27:56,639
[SPEAKER_22]: And then, you know, you find these little levels, and the way that the levels are set up, you have your entry level, which is level 0, then you have 1, 10, 2, 20, or, you know, like that.

2136
02:27:56,879 --> 02:27:58,119
[SPEAKER_13]: It was 1, 11, didn't it?

2137
02:27:58,139 --> 02:27:58,379
[SPEAKER_13]: It wasn't 11, 12?

2138
02:27:58,960 --> 02:27:59,480
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, it was 1, 11.

2139
02:28:00,500 --> 02:28:00,640
[SPEAKER_22]: It was 1, 11.

2140
02:28:01,201 --> 02:28:02,381
[SPEAKER_22]: Because when you get to level 10, it's 10, 20.

2141
02:28:03,842 --> 02:28:06,763
[SPEAKER_22]: Which were, by the way, the freaking hardest levels in the universe.

2142
02:28:07,964 --> 02:28:08,404
[SPEAKER_13]: Awesome game.

2143
02:28:08,444 --> 02:28:11,185
[SPEAKER_22]: I have beaten that game all of once.

2144
02:28:13,001 --> 02:28:13,642
[SPEAKER_13]: Beautiful game.

2145
02:28:13,882 --> 02:28:15,985
[SPEAKER_22]: I can beat the last level of the game.

2146
02:28:16,465 --> 02:28:17,747
[SPEAKER_22]: I can breeze my way through.

2147
02:28:18,227 --> 02:28:22,593
[SPEAKER_22]: Because once you get the backfire weapon, you just sit in a corner and shoot it with the backfire weapon.

2148
02:28:23,024 --> 02:28:30,205
[SPEAKER_13]: And by the way, your game counselor tip of the day, use TGL as your password to bypass the Zelda-ish part of the game.

2149
02:28:30,225 --> 02:28:32,446
[SPEAKER_22]: It also had an unbreakable password system.

2150
02:28:34,126 --> 02:28:36,447
[SPEAKER_22]: Trust me, no one has been able to break this password system.

2151
02:28:36,767 --> 02:28:42,728
[SPEAKER_22]: You know, I could figure out all the Mega Man ones, like, you know, no problem, but no one can break the Guardian Legends password system.

2152
02:28:43,048 --> 02:28:47,789
[SPEAKER_22]: But if you put in TGL, you can bypass all the adventure levels, and you play it just like a shooter.

2153
02:28:48,249 --> 02:28:51,890
[SPEAKER_22]: In between levels, you get your special weapons and what you normally would have gotten if you keep going on.

2154
02:28:52,478 --> 02:28:52,758
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

2155
02:28:54,159 --> 02:28:55,459
[SPEAKER_13]: Enough about whoring out that boy.

2156
02:28:55,500 --> 02:28:56,660
[SPEAKER_13]: We spent a lot of time on that one.

2157
02:28:57,060 --> 02:28:58,621
[SPEAKER_13]: It's obvious we're a little biased here.

2158
02:28:58,661 --> 02:28:58,921
[SPEAKER_13]: Sorry.

2159
02:28:59,301 --> 02:29:01,322
[SPEAKER_13]: Zero, what's your number one pick?

2160
02:29:01,482 --> 02:29:05,464
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, my number one pick was Super Mario Bros.

2161
02:29:05,484 --> 02:29:05,464
3.

2162
02:29:05,544 --> 02:29:08,606
[SPEAKER_07]: Because it was, I don't know, it was just like the best one.

2163
02:29:08,646 --> 02:29:13,608
[SPEAKER_07]: It almost seemed like it was kind of ahead of its time when it came to getting all the different suits and stuff.

2164
02:29:13,788 --> 02:29:17,810
[SPEAKER_07]: And plus, the first time anyone ever saw it was in the greatest movie ever.

2165
02:29:17,830 --> 02:29:18,271
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

2166
02:29:19,732 --> 02:29:20,412
[SPEAKER_09]: and The Wizard.

2167
02:29:21,193 --> 02:29:23,736
[SPEAKER_07]: The Wizard is the coolest movie in history.

2168
02:29:23,836 --> 02:29:25,517
[SPEAKER_07]: If you haven't seen it, go buy it.

2169
02:29:26,999 --> 02:29:27,720
[SPEAKER_07]: The Power Glove.

2170
02:29:27,800 --> 02:29:28,460
[SPEAKER_07]: It's so bad.

2171
02:29:28,520 --> 02:29:29,421
[SPEAKER_22]: Go rent it.

2172
02:29:29,741 --> 02:29:31,423
[SPEAKER_22]: Get your Power Glove off her.

2173
02:29:32,124 --> 02:29:33,045
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, what was the point?

2174
02:29:33,065 --> 02:29:33,805
[SPEAKER_09]: Have a Power Glove.

2175
02:29:33,966 --> 02:29:35,407
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't even think it was that useful.

2176
02:29:36,008 --> 02:29:38,570
[SPEAKER_09]: I think he used it for like two things and that was it.

2177
02:29:41,761 --> 02:29:46,965
[SPEAKER_22]: I want the left hand and the right hand one, so I could do, like, try to figure out how to weak punch out to it.

2178
02:29:47,326 --> 02:29:48,306
[SPEAKER_15]: That would be so cool, isn't it?

2179
02:29:48,407 --> 02:29:50,128
[SPEAKER_22]: Or the, you can use, remember the U-Force?

2180
02:29:50,308 --> 02:29:51,209
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

2181
02:29:51,229 --> 02:29:54,852
[SPEAKER_09]: That thing, all you could use it on was, like, Rad Racer, and that was it.

2182
02:29:56,033 --> 02:29:56,974
[SPEAKER_09]: It was pretty retarded.

2183
02:29:58,195 --> 02:30:05,681
[SPEAKER_10]: You should wire two power gloves, okay, wire it to, like, you know, the DDR type thing, and just play DDR with your hands.

2184
02:30:07,913 --> 02:30:15,442
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, well, the one problem is the left-handed Power Glove is so, like, unbelievably rare that if you find one, you can easily sell it on eBay for $100.

2185
02:30:15,482 --> 02:30:22,049
[SPEAKER_07]: People are, like, I've seen the Power Glove on eBay already for a couple, for, like, $500.

2186
02:30:22,289 --> 02:30:24,031
[SPEAKER_20]: They're just a right.

2187
02:30:25,193 --> 02:30:26,915
[SPEAKER_20]: For, like, $500, you can't find them anywhere.

2188
02:30:28,248 --> 02:30:33,051
[SPEAKER_10]: You should... You should check on your fans what they're doing for you.

2189
02:30:33,571 --> 02:30:34,892
[SPEAKER_22]: I do indeed have two Power Gloves.

2190
02:30:35,192 --> 02:30:36,613
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, uh, my pick.

2191
02:30:36,633 --> 02:30:37,913
[SPEAKER_10]: There's like tons of choices.

2192
02:30:38,614 --> 02:30:39,774
[SPEAKER_14]: Tons of choices.

2193
02:30:40,695 --> 02:30:43,136
[SPEAKER_22]: Um... Get your Power Glove off her!

2194
02:30:44,637 --> 02:30:46,958
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, you know, it's kind of an... Ah!

2195
02:30:47,018 --> 02:30:47,999
[SPEAKER_14]: He touched my breast!

2196
02:30:52,801 --> 02:30:53,602
[SPEAKER_12]: That was great.

2197
02:30:54,162 --> 02:30:54,842
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, man.

2198
02:30:55,022 --> 02:30:55,823
[SPEAKER_14]: Did Drew touch your breast?

2199
02:30:55,883 --> 02:30:55,963
[SPEAKER_14]: No.

2200
02:30:57,830 --> 02:31:05,873
[SPEAKER_10]: One of my favorite games on the Nintendo had to have been... I don't know, I go back and play it now and it's just like, okay, whatever.

2201
02:31:06,614 --> 02:31:09,055
[SPEAKER_22]: Bionic Commando.

2202
02:31:10,395 --> 02:31:11,816
[SPEAKER_22]: Do you ever read Old Schooled?

2203
02:31:13,136 --> 02:31:20,579
[SPEAKER_22]: The guy from Bionic Commando hangs out in the bar with all the other Nintendo characters and he's like their hero because his bionic arm can reach out and grab beer from across the hall.

2204
02:31:25,061 --> 02:31:25,801
[SPEAKER_13]: Anything else you want to...

2205
02:31:27,166 --> 02:31:47,311
[SPEAKER_10]: That game was cool because you didn't have an arm, you had this giant claw thing that grabbed on stuff, and you couldn't jump because I guess the arm weighed too much, and there's these guys that looked all the same, but they were different shades of color, but they were different people, and stuff happened, and if you got caught by the people, then more people came.

2206
02:31:47,371 --> 02:31:48,732
[SPEAKER_22]: And it had the best ending.

2207
02:31:48,872 --> 02:31:49,632
[SPEAKER_22]: You blew up Hitler.

2208
02:31:50,472 --> 02:31:51,412
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, and you blew up Hitler.

2209
02:31:55,276 --> 02:31:57,401
[SPEAKER_07]: The fact, also, you could choose your path, too.

2210
02:31:58,043 --> 02:32:03,675
[SPEAKER_07]: And, like, you could say, I want to go this way, to, like, B or K, and then bounce all around, and it's pretty fun.

2211
02:32:05,290 --> 02:32:07,511
[SPEAKER_22]: You said BK, and I started thinking of British Nights.

2212
02:32:07,951 --> 02:32:09,052
[SPEAKER_13]: I started thinking of Burger King.

2213
02:32:09,512 --> 02:32:10,052
[SPEAKER_10]: Hold on!

2214
02:32:11,453 --> 02:32:17,636
[SPEAKER_10]: I gotta, I'm sorry, you know, I like Bionic Commando, but there's just something that just got flashing in my mind.

2215
02:32:18,117 --> 02:32:21,578
[SPEAKER_10]: One of the best games ever, and I need to change mine.

2216
02:32:21,778 --> 02:32:22,219
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry.

2217
02:32:22,419 --> 02:32:24,060
[SPEAKER_13]: You wanna change that one, or you wanna change one of your other ones?

2218
02:32:24,700 --> 02:32:26,261
[SPEAKER_13]: You wanna change Contra, Castlevania II?

2219
02:32:26,841 --> 02:32:27,521
[SPEAKER_10]: Change Contra.

2220
02:32:28,282 --> 02:32:28,962
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, okay.

2221
02:32:32,304 --> 02:32:34,145
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, what are we putting on instead of Contra, then?

2222
02:32:35,526 --> 02:32:38,109
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, this might be a bad decision, but Marble Madness.

2223
02:32:38,709 --> 02:32:39,971
[SPEAKER_13]: Marble Madness!

2224
02:32:47,899 --> 02:32:52,104
[SPEAKER_14]: Best game ever, and I wish they'd make it on a new system, but they haven't yet.

2225
02:32:54,218 --> 02:33:01,684
[SPEAKER_22]: It's on the Atari collection for the, um, or no, the Midway collection for, uh, PlayStation, and you can actually get the PlayStation track while we got one.

2226
02:33:02,064 --> 02:33:04,607
[SPEAKER_13]: I can't believe he just took off Contra to put in Marble Madness.

2227
02:33:05,007 --> 02:33:07,709
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, let's read the list.

2228
02:33:08,269 --> 02:33:08,810
[SPEAKER_13]: Here we go.

2229
02:33:09,230 --> 02:33:20,259
[SPEAKER_13]: The list so far, Dancer Aerobics, Kid Dracula, Hogan's Alley, Marble Madness, Mega Man 2, The Legend of Zelda, Arknoid, Castlevania II, Simon's Quest, Blaster Master, The Guardian Legends, Super Mario Bros.

2230
02:33:20,559 --> 02:33:21,180
[SPEAKER_13]: 3, and Bionic.

2231
02:33:22,301 --> 02:33:27,243
[SPEAKER_13]: Now let's go through those glaring omissions according to our chat room that we left off of the list.

2232
02:33:27,263 --> 02:33:28,384
[SPEAKER_21]: I know they're going to say Metroid.

2233
02:33:28,824 --> 02:33:30,365
[SPEAKER_13]: Metroid, the most obvious.

2234
02:33:30,485 --> 02:33:31,686
[SPEAKER_13]: Metal Gear.

2235
02:33:31,946 --> 02:33:32,846
[SPEAKER_13]: Nobody said Metal Gear.

2236
02:33:33,987 --> 02:33:35,028
[SPEAKER_13]: Final Fantasy.

2237
02:33:36,068 --> 02:33:36,889
[SPEAKER_13]: Adventure Island.

2238
02:33:38,069 --> 02:33:38,810
[SPEAKER_13]: RoboCop.

2239
02:33:41,991 --> 02:33:43,212
[SPEAKER_13]: Gyro Mike, come on.

2240
02:33:44,013 --> 02:33:44,773
[SPEAKER_13]: Burger Time.

2241
02:33:44,833 --> 02:33:46,694
[SPEAKER_13]: You can squash the professor, that's a good point.

2242
02:33:47,895 --> 02:33:48,776
[SPEAKER_13]: Dragon Warrior.

2243
02:33:49,036 --> 02:33:49,296
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah.

2244
02:33:50,317 --> 02:33:50,757
[SPEAKER_22]: Dragon Warrior 4.

2245
02:33:50,797 --> 02:33:51,778
[SPEAKER_13]: Just because it had a slime.

2246
02:33:52,258 --> 02:33:53,659
[SPEAKER_13]: Bubble Bobble.

2247
02:33:54,159 --> 02:33:58,822
[SPEAKER_13]: Bubble Bobble is a kick-ass game, however the NES translation just was not the same as the arcade.

2248
02:33:59,022 --> 02:34:04,566
[SPEAKER_13]: If we were talking about like best 80s arcade game maybe, I'd put Bubble Bobble on there, but not for best Nintendo game.

2249
02:34:04,606 --> 02:34:05,266
[SPEAKER_13]: Kickle Cubicle.

2250
02:34:05,527 --> 02:34:06,687
[SPEAKER_13]: Kickle Cubicle was pretty cool.

2251
02:34:07,248 --> 02:34:08,689
[SPEAKER_22]: And, and, and, Fantasy Zone.

2252
02:34:09,669 --> 02:34:17,855
[SPEAKER_13]: Kid Icarus, Ice Climber, Battletoads, River City Ransom, Double Dragon Star Tropics, Mario Tennis Don't mention any stupid Virtual Boy games because they all give me a headache.

2253
02:34:33,945 --> 02:34:35,126
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm just kind of scrambling lists.

2254
02:34:35,206 --> 02:34:38,267
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, and then last, we have Adventures of Lolo.

2255
02:34:38,727 --> 02:34:39,988
[SPEAKER_13]: Hey, I mentioned it.

2256
02:34:40,208 --> 02:34:42,169
[SPEAKER_13]: I have bad memory.

2257
02:34:42,189 --> 02:34:46,752
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I'm just kidding.

2258
02:34:46,932 --> 02:34:47,592
[SPEAKER_13]: Clu Clu Land.

2259
02:34:47,872 --> 02:34:49,413
[SPEAKER_13]: I have psychological damage every time.

2260
02:34:49,533 --> 02:34:49,953
[SPEAKER_13]: No, I'm kidding.

2261
02:34:49,973 --> 02:34:52,094
[SPEAKER_22]: I can play Clu Clu Land on Animal Crossing.

2262
02:34:52,374 --> 02:34:53,635
[SPEAKER_22]: I can play Balloon Fight on Animal Crossing.

2263
02:34:53,875 --> 02:34:55,216
[SPEAKER_13]: Kid Icarus, did I say that already?

2264
02:34:55,296 --> 02:34:55,456
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

2265
02:34:55,476 --> 02:34:56,937
[SPEAKER_13]: Kid Icarus, Mike Tyson's Punch Out.

2266
02:34:56,957 --> 02:35:00,859
[SPEAKER_22]: Remember, here's your other pro tip of the day for Kid Icarus.

2267
02:35:00,979 --> 02:35:02,740
[SPEAKER_22]: It's Icarus fights Medusa Angels.

2268
02:35:03,360 --> 02:35:07,041
[SPEAKER_07]: When I find a place to upload it, I'm going to upload my DWI to the Mike Tyson's Punch-Out!!

2269
02:35:07,061 --> 02:35:07,261
[SPEAKER_22]: remix.

2270
02:35:07,281 --> 02:35:11,922
[SPEAKER_09]: There's like urbic DWI to it, it took me like 30 minutes, but it was really good.

2271
02:35:31,799 --> 02:35:34,981
[SPEAKER_07]: And it has the instruction manual as the background.

2272
02:35:36,721 --> 02:35:37,242
[SPEAKER_07]: That's great.

2273
02:35:38,362 --> 02:35:38,862
[SPEAKER_13]: Alrighty.

2274
02:35:39,823 --> 02:35:41,684
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, so now we gotta vote stuff off.

2275
02:35:41,724 --> 02:35:44,125
[SPEAKER_13]: This is gonna be very difficult tonight, you guys.

2276
02:35:44,465 --> 02:35:45,646
[SPEAKER_13]: It's gonna be very difficult.

2277
02:35:46,706 --> 02:35:47,907
[SPEAKER_13]: I guess I have to start, huh?

2278
02:35:48,087 --> 02:35:48,287
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

2279
02:35:50,128 --> 02:35:52,008
[SPEAKER_13]: Uh, well, you're all going to hate me.

2280
02:35:52,068 --> 02:35:53,229
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm taking off Marble Madness.

2281
02:35:54,609 --> 02:35:56,729
[SPEAKER_13]: The reason why, no, I have good justification.

2282
02:35:57,129 --> 02:35:59,170
[SPEAKER_13]: Because Marble Madness was way too short.

2283
02:35:59,670 --> 02:36:00,790
[SPEAKER_13]: It was only six levels.

2284
02:36:00,950 --> 02:36:02,630
[SPEAKER_13]: The thrill was gone in a day.

2285
02:36:04,291 --> 02:36:06,491
[SPEAKER_13]: I just can't, nah, I can't let it be there.

2286
02:36:06,511 --> 02:36:08,952
[SPEAKER_22]: Marble Madness is really only worthy to play if you have the trackball.

2287
02:36:10,332 --> 02:36:16,173
[SPEAKER_22]: Which is why I was very lucky to hit Toys R Us when they were clearing out their trackballs for like 75% off for the PlayStation.

2288
02:36:17,623 --> 02:36:32,433
[SPEAKER_13]: Me, Dance Aerobics Because I sprained my ankle playing that game I have painful memories of Dance Aerobics This sucks, because the two obvious ones are gone now

2289
02:36:34,494 --> 02:36:37,375
[SPEAKER_07]: I will take off my own, Hogan's Alley.

2290
02:36:38,655 --> 02:36:42,396
[SPEAKER_07]: It was fun, but it's not one of the very best games ever.

2291
02:36:42,656 --> 02:36:48,057
[SPEAKER_13]: Amazingly enough, first time in the history of this show, if I'm not mistaken, somebody took their own item off the list.

2292
02:36:48,837 --> 02:36:49,038
[SPEAKER_13]: No.

2293
02:36:49,278 --> 02:36:49,378
[SPEAKER_22]: No?

2294
02:36:49,478 --> 02:36:50,818
[SPEAKER_22]: We did Listless last week.

2295
02:36:51,338 --> 02:36:52,558
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, did you all do that or something?

2296
02:36:52,718 --> 02:36:56,439
[SPEAKER_22]: I forgot what we did it about, but everybody but me took off Best Liquor.

2297
02:36:56,719 --> 02:36:58,080
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, God, you guys.

2298
02:36:58,540 --> 02:37:01,641
[SPEAKER_22]: Everybody but me took off one of their own.

2299
02:37:02,001 --> 02:37:03,041
[SPEAKER_13]: I stand corrected.

2300
02:37:03,821 --> 02:37:06,122
[SPEAKER_22]: One thing I can't believe we all forgot was Excitebike.

2301
02:37:06,742 --> 02:37:09,964
[SPEAKER_07]: Even though it was short, even though it was short, it was still a classic.

2302
02:37:10,024 --> 02:37:12,965
[SPEAKER_13]: Excitebike was awesome, but it badly needed an update.

2303
02:37:13,245 --> 02:37:16,887
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, I guess some say that Uniracers is supposed to be a sequel to Excitebike.

2304
02:37:17,147 --> 02:37:18,068
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't buy that.

2305
02:37:18,368 --> 02:37:20,989
[SPEAKER_07]: And the 64 version was absolutely horrible.

2306
02:37:21,289 --> 02:37:22,089
[SPEAKER_07]: I never played that.

2307
02:37:22,149 --> 02:37:22,550
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, God.

2308
02:37:22,570 --> 02:37:22,950
[SPEAKER_07]: It was stupid.

2309
02:37:25,413 --> 02:37:26,474
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, well.

2310
02:37:26,594 --> 02:37:27,074
[SPEAKER_13]: Actually, no.

2311
02:37:27,094 --> 02:37:27,854
[SPEAKER_13]: There was one on Game Boy.

2312
02:37:27,874 --> 02:37:30,535
[SPEAKER_13]: I think it was Motocross Maniacs or something that played kind of similar.

2313
02:37:31,516 --> 02:37:32,016
[SPEAKER_13]: But it was ass.

2314
02:37:32,456 --> 02:37:32,756
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

2315
02:37:33,777 --> 02:37:34,877
[SPEAKER_13]: Loki, last one coming off.

2316
02:37:34,917 --> 02:37:35,237
[SPEAKER_13]: What is it?

2317
02:37:38,279 --> 02:37:41,960
[SPEAKER_10]: Just Arkanoid because I don't like that game.

2318
02:37:43,141 --> 02:37:43,521
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

2319
02:37:43,601 --> 02:37:44,762
[SPEAKER_13]: Arkanoid comes off the list.

2320
02:37:45,682 --> 02:37:51,405
[SPEAKER_10]: It was either there or Kid Dracula because Kid Dracula just reminds me of that stupid little vampire movie.

2321
02:37:51,805 --> 02:37:53,746
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank God I hate that little vampire movie.

2322
02:38:00,342 --> 02:38:01,403
[SPEAKER_13]: Jamie's going to make him play now.

2323
02:38:01,783 --> 02:38:05,365
[SPEAKER_13]: All right, here we go.

2324
02:38:05,585 --> 02:38:06,265
[SPEAKER_13]: This is the list.

2325
02:38:07,246 --> 02:38:08,826
[SPEAKER_13]: Send in your votes right now.

2327
02:38:15,470 --> 02:38:15,890
[SPEAKER_13]: I read those.

2328
02:38:16,811 --> 02:38:17,331
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, okay.

2329
02:38:17,711 --> 02:38:17,991
[SPEAKER_13]: Sorry.

2330
02:38:18,251 --> 02:38:18,712
[SPEAKER_13]: I read those.

2331
02:38:18,752 --> 02:38:20,553
[SPEAKER_13]: You were too busy getting mad at Loki.

2332
02:38:20,633 --> 02:38:21,733
[SPEAKER_13]: All right, then start from the top.

2333
02:38:22,053 --> 02:38:23,374
[SPEAKER_13]: Hold on, I'm going to post this in the chat room.

2334
02:38:24,875 --> 02:38:25,815
[SPEAKER_13]: All right, start from the top.

2335

[SPEAKER_13]: Best 8-bit game ever.

02:38:44,495 --> 02:38:45,996
[SPEAKER_13]: In the meantime, we're going to take a quick break.

2340
02:38:46,016 --> 02:38:46,557
[SPEAKER_13]: We'll be back.

2341
02:38:46,657 --> 02:38:52,821
[SPEAKER_13]: We've got some brief announcements and reminders, a message, and other things.

2342
02:38:55,177 --> 02:39:06,690
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, more people need to vote than voted on the cage match, because you guys got a surprise thing in there, because nobody voted on cage match, so y'all better be voting for listless.

2343
02:39:07,090 --> 02:39:10,534
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, we'll be right back after we hear this 8th style song that makes me wet.

2344
02:39:10,734 --> 02:39:11,115
[SPEAKER_13]: Just kidding.

2345
02:39:11,876 --> 02:39:11,996
Okay.

[SPEAKER_19]: Let's listen in on an Orange Lounge Radio staff meeting.

2351
02:44:22,115 --> 02:44:23,836
[SPEAKER_23]: Do you want to be accepted by Hollywood?

2352
02:44:23,876 --> 02:44:24,236
[SPEAKER_23]: No!

2353
02:44:24,356 --> 02:44:27,997
[SPEAKER_23]: Do we care what people think of us?

2354
02:44:28,617 --> 02:44:30,478
[SPEAKER_23]: No!

2355
02:44:30,498 --> 02:44:31,938
[SPEAKER_23]: Do we want people to kiss our ass?

02:44:32,379 --> 02:44:32,599
[SPEAKER_23]: Yes!

2357
02:44:36,477 --> 02:44:38,318

2361
02:44:47,303 --> 02:44:48,123
[SPEAKER_13]: I heard a funny joke.

2362
02:44:48,343 --> 02:44:49,844
[SPEAKER_13]: Irene and Brad told me a funny joke today.

2363
02:44:50,664 --> 02:44:53,646
[SPEAKER_13]: I thought we'd have joke time on Orange Lounge Radio.

2364
02:44:53,686 --> 02:44:54,106
[SPEAKER_13]: So here we go.

2365
02:44:54,687 --> 02:44:55,347
[SPEAKER_13]: Knock, knock.

2366
02:44:56,187 --> 02:44:56,848
[SPEAKER_13]: Interrupting cow.

2367
02:45:01,440 --> 02:45:03,460
[SPEAKER_09]: That's like totally from South Park.

2368
02:45:04,261 --> 02:45:04,821
[SPEAKER_11]: Is it really?

2369
02:45:04,981 --> 02:45:08,241
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it's from... The other retarded kid, I forget his name.

2370
02:45:08,261 --> 02:45:09,262
[SPEAKER_22]: I still like the muffin joke.

2371
02:45:09,642 --> 02:45:10,222
[SPEAKER_13]: Damn it!

2372
02:45:10,942 --> 02:45:15,223
[SPEAKER_13]: I didn't know that was from South because I stopped watching South Park because I didn't even know they were making new ones anymore.

2373
02:45:15,903 --> 02:45:16,263
[SPEAKER_13]: Damn.

2374
02:45:16,663 --> 02:45:18,224
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, you want me to tell the muffin joke?

2375
02:45:18,304 --> 02:45:18,824
[SPEAKER_22]: I want to tell it.

2376
02:45:19,324 --> 02:45:19,624
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright.

2377
02:45:20,104 --> 02:45:20,924
[SPEAKER_13]: You remember the muffin joke?

2378
02:45:20,984 --> 02:45:21,884
[SPEAKER_22]: Have you heard the muffin joke?

2379
02:45:22,285 --> 02:45:22,885
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

2380
02:45:22,905 --> 02:45:23,665
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll give Ryan the other mic.

2381
02:45:23,705 --> 02:45:24,265
[SPEAKER_22]: Alright.

2382
02:45:26,998 --> 02:45:28,501
[SPEAKER_22]: Two muffins are baking in the oven.

2383
02:45:29,182 --> 02:45:32,068
[SPEAKER_22]: And one of the other muffins goes, Oh my god, we're cooking, we're burning!

2384
02:45:32,188 --> 02:45:33,471
[SPEAKER_22]: The other one goes, Oh shit, a talking muffin.

2385
02:45:34,954 --> 02:45:35,475
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh my god.

2386
02:45:38,584 --> 02:45:39,044
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

2387
02:45:40,385 --> 02:45:41,545
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Irene.

2388
02:45:42,186 --> 02:45:42,566
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright.

2389
02:45:43,687 --> 02:45:46,708
[SPEAKER_13]: I feel stupid now that I know that joke came from South Park, Jesus Christ.

2390
02:45:46,728 --> 02:45:49,730
[SPEAKER_07]: You wanna talk about a stupid joke, but it was kinda, it was funny the way it was said?

2391
02:45:49,950 --> 02:45:52,091
[SPEAKER_07]: Has anybody seen Catch Me If You Can?

2392
02:45:52,691 --> 02:45:52,851
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

2393
02:45:53,031 --> 02:45:57,213
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a part where Tom Hanks is sitting there with a bunch of other FBI agents, and he's all, why don't you tell a joke?

2394
02:45:57,393 --> 02:46:00,455
[SPEAKER_07]: And he's all, okay, he's all, knock knock, and all, who's there?

2395
02:46:00,475 --> 02:46:01,395
[SPEAKER_07]: And he goes, go fuck yourself.

2396
02:46:01,916 --> 02:46:02,596
[SPEAKER_07]: And that was the end of the joke.

2397
02:46:05,826 --> 02:46:06,167
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

2398
02:46:06,247 --> 02:46:07,148
[SPEAKER_22]: You know what was a joke?

2399
02:46:07,188 --> 02:46:09,510
[SPEAKER_22]: Those pictures of the person playing DDR just as Sakura.

2400
02:46:10,751 --> 02:46:11,211
[SPEAKER_13]: That was cute.

2401
02:46:11,431 --> 02:46:12,172
[SPEAKER_13]: That was cute.

2402
02:46:12,372 --> 02:46:13,393
[SPEAKER_13]: That was a cute routine.

2403
02:46:13,653 --> 02:46:13,914
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

2404
02:46:13,934 --> 02:46:14,674
[SPEAKER_22]: That was good costume.

2405
02:46:14,694 --> 02:46:15,695
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, it was cool.

2406
02:46:16,236 --> 02:46:16,896
[SPEAKER_13]: It wasn't a joke.

2407
02:46:16,977 --> 02:46:18,298
[SPEAKER_13]: It was serious time, man.

2408
02:46:19,022 --> 02:46:19,442
[SPEAKER_22]: CyberBeat Special

2409
02:46:49,042 --> 02:47:03,365
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm not hooked on it I'm not hooked on it Alright, here we go Number 3, by your vote, listless, here it is Number 3, best 8-bit game ever, drumroll Is Super Mario Bros.

2410
02:47:03,385 --> 02:47:08,707
[SPEAKER_13]: 3 Or as the guy in the wizard said, Super Mario Bros.

2411
02:47:08,727 --> 02:47:09,727
[SPEAKER_13]: 3 Okay

2412
02:47:17,859 --> 02:47:20,700
[SPEAKER_13]: Number two, best Nintendo game ever.

2413
02:47:20,800 --> 02:47:21,540
[SPEAKER_22]: Did you give a drum roll?

2414
02:47:22,180 --> 02:47:22,381
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

2415
02:47:24,001 --> 02:47:28,703
[SPEAKER_13]: The Legend of Zelda.

2416
02:47:29,083 --> 02:47:37,146
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, and the best Nintendo game ever, as voted by you guys, Mega Man 2 is the winner.

2417
02:47:37,226 --> 02:47:41,547
[SPEAKER_13]: Mega Man 2 is the best Nintendo game ever, according to the chat room.

2418
02:47:44,108 --> 02:47:44,368
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright.

2419
02:47:46,590 --> 02:47:48,391
[SPEAKER_13]: Guardian Legend didn't get a single vote.

2420
02:47:48,431 --> 02:47:49,532
[SPEAKER_13]: How the hell did that happen?

2421
02:47:50,193 --> 02:47:52,775
[SPEAKER_07]: It's mostly because people play all the mainstream games.

2422
02:47:53,255 --> 02:47:54,936
[SPEAKER_07]: Like Blaster Master is mainstream as it was.

2423
02:47:54,956 --> 02:47:59,760
[SPEAKER_13]: See, that's why I was surprised because I didn't think anybody in here was going to end up putting a mainstream.

2424
02:47:59,900 --> 02:48:03,142
[SPEAKER_13]: When I was listening to the number three choices, I'm like, nobody's going to put a mainstream game on here.

2425
02:48:03,182 --> 02:48:04,683
[SPEAKER_13]: And then all of a sudden the number ones were all mainstream.

2426
02:48:05,024 --> 02:48:07,806
[SPEAKER_07]: I wasn't going to put a bunch of other ones.

2427
02:48:08,286 --> 02:48:10,588
[SPEAKER_07]: But no one really played Arkanoid or Hogan's Alley.

2428
02:48:10,668 --> 02:48:11,509
[SPEAKER_13]: I played Arkanoid.

2429
02:48:11,569 --> 02:48:12,769
[SPEAKER_13]: It just was an arcade game.

2430
02:48:13,030 --> 02:48:13,770
[SPEAKER_13]: And I played Hogan's Alley.

2431
02:48:13,810 --> 02:48:15,792
[SPEAKER_22]: All you bitches need to go play Guardian Legend.

2432
02:48:16,598 --> 02:48:17,958
[SPEAKER_13]: It's all about bad dudes.

2433
02:48:18,939 --> 02:48:19,959
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, jeez.

2434
02:48:20,379 --> 02:48:22,980
[SPEAKER_13]: What was the one which had, like, a fat lady as a boss?

2435
02:48:23,780 --> 02:48:24,760
[SPEAKER_13]: Was that Rampage?

2436
02:48:24,800 --> 02:48:25,520
[SPEAKER_13]: Or not Rampage?

2437
02:48:25,580 --> 02:48:25,900
[SPEAKER_13]: Renegade.

2438
02:48:25,940 --> 02:48:26,700
[SPEAKER_22]: No, no, no, no, no, no.

2439
02:48:26,720 --> 02:48:27,200
[SPEAKER_22]: Best game ever.

2440
02:48:27,281 --> 02:48:27,881
[SPEAKER_22]: Super Dodgeball.

2441
02:48:30,081 --> 02:48:31,822
[SPEAKER_22]: It was one of the two of your games.

2442
02:48:32,482 --> 02:48:35,102
[SPEAKER_14]: Ikari Warriors, because it always glitched out when we played it.

2443
02:48:35,282 --> 02:48:39,563
[SPEAKER_14]: We used to get dust on the game just to see how badly it'd glitch out.

2444
02:48:39,963 --> 02:48:40,824
[SPEAKER_14]: It was awesome.

2445
02:48:41,164 --> 02:48:43,004
[SPEAKER_09]: No, it was all about pro wrestling.

2446
02:48:43,244 --> 02:48:45,785
[SPEAKER_09]: The one where you had, like, one kick and one punch.

2447
02:48:46,085 --> 02:48:46,285
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

2448
02:48:47,330 --> 02:48:47,670
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

2449
02:48:48,291 --> 02:48:51,573
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, we had another joke in the chat room.

2450
02:48:51,593 --> 02:48:52,353
[SPEAKER_13]: This is pretty funny.

2451
02:48:52,833 --> 02:48:54,134
[SPEAKER_13]: John Fields submitted this joke.

2452
02:48:54,474 --> 02:48:55,735
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, two guys are hunting in the woods.

2453
02:48:56,215 --> 02:48:57,996
[SPEAKER_13]: One gets hurt and the other goes 9-1-1.

2454
02:48:58,036 --> 02:49:00,538
[SPEAKER_13]: The operator says, okay, well, let's make sure he's hurt.

2455
02:49:00,858 --> 02:49:02,339
[SPEAKER_13]: There's silence, then a gunshot.

2456
02:49:02,839 --> 02:49:04,300
[SPEAKER_13]: Guy comes back on and says, okay, what now?

2457
02:49:06,181 --> 02:49:07,842
[SPEAKER_21]: Have I ever told the story of the poo-poo bird?

2458
02:49:07,862 --> 02:49:10,663
[SPEAKER_21]: That joke seems right to me.

2459
02:49:10,804 --> 02:49:11,384
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm sure he's...

2460
02:49:12,327 --> 02:49:13,388
[SPEAKER_10]: He says, my friend's dead.

2461
02:49:13,728 --> 02:49:16,510
[SPEAKER_10]: And they're all, well, first make sure that he's dead, you know.

2462
02:49:17,151 --> 02:49:18,092
[SPEAKER_10]: And then he kills him.

2463
02:49:18,772 --> 02:49:20,634
[SPEAKER_21]: Has anyone here ever heard the story of the Foo Poo Bird?

2464
02:49:20,654 --> 02:49:22,395
[SPEAKER_21]: You're such a bitch, Loki.

2465
02:49:22,415 --> 02:49:23,716
[SPEAKER_22]: Have you heard the story of the Foo Poo Bird?

2466
02:49:24,677 --> 02:49:24,817
No.

2467
02:49:25,537 --> 02:49:25,818
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay.

2468
02:49:26,558 --> 02:49:30,081
[SPEAKER_22]: These three great explorers have hunted this legendary bird called the Foo Poo Bird.

2469
02:49:30,842 --> 02:49:33,784
[SPEAKER_22]: The legend is that this bird is making people disappear, but no one knows how.

2470
02:49:34,665 --> 02:49:36,426
[SPEAKER_22]: So they go into the deep, deep, deep, deep jungle.

2471
02:49:37,287 --> 02:49:41,370
[SPEAKER_22]: And two of them are together, and one of them is by himself, because this one by himself thinks that he's just shit.

2472
02:49:42,034 --> 02:49:48,096
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, anyway, he's walking along, and he hears... There's a big wad of bird shit on his head.

2473
02:49:48,676 --> 02:49:49,476
[SPEAKER_22]: He does a little crap.

2474
02:49:49,516 --> 02:49:51,617
[SPEAKER_22]: He wipes it off, and he disappears.

2475
02:49:53,017 --> 02:49:54,318
[SPEAKER_22]: Ooh, scary.

2476
02:49:55,178 --> 02:50:02,000
[SPEAKER_22]: So the other two are together, and sure enough, they hear... And one of them gets shit on his head.

2477
02:50:02,560 --> 02:50:06,542
[SPEAKER_22]: So he wipes it off, and he disappears, and his friend goes, Oh my god, that's how it happens!

2478
02:50:07,682 --> 02:50:09,903
[SPEAKER_22]: But right before he gets to the end of the course...

2479
02:50:13,263 --> 02:50:15,225
[SPEAKER_22]: and he gets crap on his head.

2480
02:50:15,865 --> 02:50:16,966
[SPEAKER_22]: So he's smart though.

2481
02:50:17,066 --> 02:50:17,927
[SPEAKER_22]: He's not wiping it off.

2482
02:50:18,407 --> 02:50:20,069
[SPEAKER_22]: So he goes home with a big pile of poo on his head.

2483
02:50:20,109 --> 02:50:23,091
[SPEAKER_22]: You know, he gets the best place to sit on the bus and everything.

2484
02:50:23,111 --> 02:50:27,995
[SPEAKER_22]: He's, you know, in bed with his wife and his wife goes, you need to wipe that crap off your head.

2485
02:50:28,255 --> 02:50:30,657
[SPEAKER_22]: He's like, no, but if I do, I'll disappear and you'll never see me again.

2486
02:50:31,017 --> 02:50:32,879
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, well, I love you and we'll leave the crap on your head.

2487
02:50:32,919 --> 02:50:33,519
[SPEAKER_22]: I can live with that.

2488
02:50:33,980 --> 02:50:37,923
[SPEAKER_22]: But the stench gets so bad that later on in the night she's like, I can't stand this.

2489
02:50:37,943 --> 02:50:38,724
[SPEAKER_22]: She wipes off his head.

2490
02:50:39,324 --> 02:50:41,506
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh my god, that was the most awful thing ever.

2491
02:50:42,027 --> 02:50:43,508
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you for wasting everybody's time.

2492
02:50:46,271 --> 02:50:46,571
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

2493
02:50:46,791 --> 02:50:48,193
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, that was the best joke and you know it.

2494
02:50:59,986 --> 02:51:01,107
[SPEAKER_13]: No, the muffin joke's the best joke.

2495
02:51:02,547 --> 02:51:09,891
[SPEAKER_13]: A new chatter in the chatroom, Bizarro17, starts off a joke, says, So I said to the prickly cactus, and that was it.

2496
02:51:09,931 --> 02:51:12,112
[SPEAKER_13]: There's no prickly cactus.

2497
02:51:12,192 --> 02:51:12,712
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

2498
02:51:14,273 --> 02:51:15,694
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, we've only got a few minutes left in the show.

2499
02:51:16,594 --> 02:51:19,675
[SPEAKER_13]: One thing I definitely want to say, a little special message out there.

2500
02:51:19,976 --> 02:51:22,457
[SPEAKER_13]: One of our biggest supporters in the world... Wash behind your ears.

2501
02:51:22,857 --> 02:51:23,897
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, wash behind your ears.

2502
02:51:24,538 --> 02:51:25,138
[SPEAKER_13]: Always floss.

2503
02:51:25,238 --> 02:51:25,958
[SPEAKER_13]: No, eat your veggies.

2504
02:51:26,299 --> 02:51:27,019
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, no, seriously.

2505
02:51:28,650 --> 02:51:37,597
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, one of our most faithful listeners, DDR Angel, who I believe has the most lines in chat out of everybody right now, currently.

2506
02:51:38,158 --> 02:51:42,641
[SPEAKER_13]: She's just a great supporter of the show, helps us make promos, she was here for an episode a couple months ago.

2507
02:51:43,202 --> 02:51:47,225
[SPEAKER_13]: She's leaving for a few months and she won't be around, so she's going to Japan.

2508
02:51:47,986 --> 02:51:49,947
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh boo hoo, she has to go to Japan.

2509
02:51:50,288 --> 02:51:50,968
[SPEAKER_13]: Poor thing.

2510
02:51:50,988 --> 02:51:51,629
[SPEAKER_13]: Is she listening right now?

2511
02:51:52,269 --> 02:51:53,190
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, of course she's listening.

2512
02:51:53,750 --> 02:51:56,513
[SPEAKER_22]: Send me an email and I'll give you my address so that we can write while you're in Japan.

2513
02:51:57,093 --> 02:51:57,934
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, okay, that'll be fun.

2514
02:51:58,396 --> 02:52:00,717
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean, email is one thing, but I want to send letters.

2515
02:52:01,658 --> 02:52:02,318
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, cool.

2516
02:52:03,219 --> 02:52:04,099
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, send us stuff.

2517
02:52:04,740 --> 02:52:05,340
[SPEAKER_13]: That'll be fun.

2518
02:52:05,860 --> 02:52:09,882
[SPEAKER_13]: So, Angel's going off to Japan, so have a great time.

2519
02:52:09,922 --> 02:52:10,483
[SPEAKER_13]: We'll miss you.

2520
02:52:10,683 --> 02:52:13,284
[SPEAKER_13]: Get listeners for our show while you're in Japan.

2521
02:52:14,025 --> 02:52:16,306
[SPEAKER_13]: And have a fabulous time.

2522
02:52:16,326 --> 02:52:16,806
[SPEAKER_13]: We'll miss you.

2523
02:52:18,767 --> 02:52:19,047
[SPEAKER_13]: What?

2524
02:52:20,528 --> 02:52:22,629
[SPEAKER_13]: No, that was pretty... That was the announcement.

2525
02:52:22,669 --> 02:52:22,729
[SPEAKER_21]: Yep.

2526
02:52:22,749 --> 02:52:22,830
[SPEAKER_21]: Yep.

2527
02:52:29,813 --> 02:52:31,074
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh yeah, the Sak Bomani thing.

2528
02:52:31,094 --> 02:52:32,475
[SPEAKER_13]: You were supposed to announce that on the show too.

2529
02:52:32,675 --> 02:52:34,256
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, let me just wrap up the Angel thing.

2530
02:52:35,096 --> 02:52:35,597
[SPEAKER_13]: What, the winner?

2531
02:52:36,357 --> 02:52:36,677
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

2532
02:52:38,298 --> 02:52:38,558
[SPEAKER_21]: Oops.

2533
02:52:39,819 --> 02:52:42,000
[SPEAKER_13]: What, you didn't tabulate the votes in time or something?

2534
02:52:42,921 --> 02:52:43,421
[SPEAKER_22]: Actually, I did.

2535
02:52:44,482 --> 02:52:44,842
[SPEAKER_22]: The winner.

2536
02:52:46,723 --> 02:52:47,664
[SPEAKER_22]: Everyone likes JB's.

2537
02:52:48,925 --> 02:52:51,066
[SPEAKER_22]: So JB, get it the hell finished so we can put it up.

2538
02:52:52,290 --> 02:52:53,951
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, but Loki, you know what?

2539
02:52:54,952 --> 02:53:01,317
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm thinking that design that you did may not go to waste, because I'm thinking maybe it's time to renovate the Orange Lounge site again.

2540
02:53:02,378 --> 02:53:06,521
[SPEAKER_22]: I actually want to use that for March Madness.

2541
02:53:08,242 --> 02:53:09,843
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, we'll figure it out.

2542
02:53:10,764 --> 02:53:15,788
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know, I just need something that loads faster on my site, and I think it loads pretty damn fast, so we'll see.

2543
02:53:21,730 --> 02:53:22,650
[SPEAKER_13]: God, Jesus, and St.

2544
02:53:22,690 --> 02:53:23,251
[SPEAKER_13]: Peter are golfing.

2545
02:53:23,271 --> 02:53:23,371
[SPEAKER_13]: St.

2546
02:53:23,391 --> 02:53:27,973
[SPEAKER_13]: Peter steps up to the tee.

2547
02:53:28,033 --> 02:53:28,693
[SPEAKER_13]: He takes a big swing.

2548
02:53:28,753 --> 02:53:29,233
[SPEAKER_13]: He hits the ball.

2549
02:53:29,253 --> 02:53:30,234
[SPEAKER_13]: It goes up into the air.

2550
02:53:30,294 --> 02:53:33,776
[SPEAKER_13]: It lands ten feet from the cup.

2551
02:53:33,796 --> 02:53:34,276
[SPEAKER_13]: Jesus steps up.

2552
02:53:34,316 --> 02:53:35,696
[SPEAKER_13]: He takes a huge swing.

2553
02:53:35,716 --> 02:53:36,297
[SPEAKER_13]: The ball goes flying.

2554
02:53:36,317 --> 02:53:37,937
[SPEAKER_13]: It lands two feet from the cup.

2555
02:53:50,303 --> 02:53:54,626
[SPEAKER_13]: God steps up, he takes the biggest swing you could ever see, the ball piddles off the tee.

2556
02:53:54,746 --> 02:54:04,313
[SPEAKER_13]: All of a sudden, a weasel comes out and picks the ball up, runs off, an eagle comes by, picks the weasel up and flies away, a hurricane comes by, blows the eagle back, and the eagle drops the weasel.

2557
02:54:06,891 --> 02:54:08,652
[SPEAKER_13]: And, hold on, because it's a little bit here.

2558
02:54:08,672 --> 02:54:16,796
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh yeah, the weasel drops the ball, the ball rolls into the cup, Jesus looks at God and says, Are you gonna play golf or are you just gonna fuck around?

2559
02:54:16,997 --> 02:54:26,041
[SPEAKER_13]: You're going to hell for that, that's pretty funny.

2560
02:54:26,502 --> 02:54:27,622
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, well, we're all going to hell.

2561
02:54:29,223 --> 02:54:30,984
[SPEAKER_13]: If you listen to this show, you're probably going to hell.

2562
02:54:32,084 --> 02:54:34,826
[SPEAKER_13]: The guy who made that t-shirt from hell.com is going to hell.

2563
02:54:38,015 --> 02:54:40,476
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, how about a sim update for the week, Loki?

2564
02:54:40,696 --> 02:54:41,957
[SPEAKER_13]: Anything you want to say about the sim world?

2565
02:54:41,977 --> 02:54:43,057
[SPEAKER_10]: Give me a cracker.

2566
02:54:43,558 --> 02:54:46,179
[SPEAKER_10]: Freaking site, not up.

2567
02:54:46,999 --> 02:54:49,080
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, let's see.

2568
02:54:50,241 --> 02:54:54,323
[SPEAKER_10]: I know there's more Stepmania updates.

2569
02:54:54,383 --> 02:54:58,545
[SPEAKER_10]: I know they keep doing CVS snapshots or whatever.

2570
02:54:58,625 --> 02:55:05,208
[SPEAKER_10]: So just keep watching those because they keep getting better and better and stuff.

2571
02:55:06,108 --> 02:55:10,293
[SPEAKER_10]: They have a bunch of cool modifiers like I mentioned before, like all the DDR Extreme stuff.

2572
02:55:11,435 --> 02:55:17,362
[SPEAKER_10]: And the Monty Sims, now they have stuff.

2573
02:55:17,402 --> 02:55:25,432
[SPEAKER_10]: The Monty Style just got, they're uploading their media section again because they switched to a dedicated server thanks to everyone's donations.

2574
02:55:26,493 --> 02:55:32,778
[SPEAKER_10]: So they're going to be up pretty soon with all the media and stuff and all the 8-style videos and whatnot.

2575
02:55:33,619 --> 02:55:34,620
[SPEAKER_10]: So they're going to be coming up.

2576
02:55:34,660 --> 02:55:40,885
[SPEAKER_10]: DDRUK is doing some weird thing with, you know, you have to be like some registered member and whatnot to download shit.

2577
02:55:41,025 --> 02:55:42,586
[SPEAKER_07]: You can't even download it anyway.

2578
02:55:42,747 --> 02:55:49,232
[SPEAKER_10]: Not that that matters anyways when my site comes up because I'm just going to have everything and say, whatever, I don't require anything, just download the hell.

2579
02:55:50,546 --> 02:55:54,391
[SPEAKER_10]: But yeah, my site, yeah, it's funny, yeah.

2580
02:55:55,713 --> 02:55:57,135
[SPEAKER_10]: Working on it, really am.

2581
02:55:57,516 --> 02:56:00,700
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a lot of shit I gotta update in order to get this site up.

2582
02:56:01,221 --> 02:56:06,148
[SPEAKER_10]: Mainly I'm working on the sim files, getting them all zipped up, putting in appropriate CD tags with them.

2583
02:56:06,568 --> 02:56:13,716
[SPEAKER_10]: But a lot of the sim files are incomplete, need to be fixed, need to make new backgrounds for them, just fix them up.

2584
02:56:13,956 --> 02:56:17,259
[SPEAKER_10]: And so that's what's taking the longest time right now.

2585
02:56:17,680 --> 02:56:19,121
[SPEAKER_10]: Right now I've got everything done.

2586
02:56:19,162 --> 02:56:22,105
[SPEAKER_10]: I have second style, third style, and I'm almost done with fourth style.

2587
02:56:22,585 --> 02:56:27,691
[SPEAKER_10]: Problem is it's going to get even slower now because the higher up I go, the more sim files I have.

2588
02:56:28,391 --> 02:56:31,333
[SPEAKER_10]: So once those are done, I promise they'll all be up.

2589
02:56:31,393 --> 02:56:35,216
[SPEAKER_10]: It'll probably be like a good 600 files up at the first update.

2590
02:56:35,236 --> 02:56:38,438
[SPEAKER_10]: So it'll be worth it, but it's just going to take a while before that comes up.

2591
02:56:39,119 --> 02:56:49,046
[SPEAKER_10]: And just so you guys know, listening, there will be every week, there will be a nice hidden page for exclusive to the listeners with sim file stuff that will not be on the site.

2592
02:56:49,426 --> 02:56:55,651
[SPEAKER_10]: and maybe I'll give it a month before I update those onto the actual site off the hidden pages.

2593
02:56:55,771 --> 02:56:58,273
[SPEAKER_10]: But those will be exclusive for the listeners of the show.

2594
02:56:58,293 --> 02:57:00,715
[SPEAKER_10]: You'll have exclusive DWIs before everyone else.

2595
02:57:00,776 --> 02:57:02,197
[SPEAKER_10]: So, enjoy.

2596
02:57:02,918 --> 02:57:09,964
[SPEAKER_07]: There's actually a pretty decent Stepmania theme that was posted on stepmania.com.

2597
02:57:10,164 --> 02:57:12,606
[SPEAKER_07]: It's called Forever Blue 2.0 or something.

2598
02:57:13,187 --> 02:57:18,091
[SPEAKER_07]: It's, I would say, a very different take on the themes you're used to.

2599
02:57:18,131 --> 02:57:20,193
[SPEAKER_07]: It's more of like a gothic type theme.

2600
02:57:20,293 --> 02:57:24,076
[SPEAKER_07]: The freeze arrows are like blue and stuff like that.

2601
02:57:24,176 --> 02:57:28,059
[SPEAKER_10]: It's actually a pretty interesting one if you download it just to see it, if anything.

2602
02:57:28,940 --> 02:57:39,470
[SPEAKER_10]: That was done by Healing Vision, one of the best fucking artists out there, and really awesome sim file maker, makes everything just like an official Konami mix, so, yeah.

2603
02:57:40,872 --> 02:57:41,252
[SPEAKER_10]: What's up?

2604
02:57:43,714 --> 02:57:45,156
[SPEAKER_14]: Twin-made announcer packs.

2605
02:57:45,583 --> 02:57:50,368
[SPEAKER_09]: No, actually, Twin, all he did was he ripped the announcers and he ripped up the thing.

2606
02:57:51,068 --> 02:57:57,294
[SPEAKER_10]: In fact, he was actually bitching about, that was one of the things he bitched about me a while back, is he wanted me to send the announcer stuff, whatever.

2607
02:57:57,795 --> 02:58:02,620
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, that's cool that he released the announcers for Solo and shit, even though... Toon Can Lady?

2608
02:58:03,400 --> 02:58:04,802
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh yeah, I have those on my computer.

2609
02:58:04,842 --> 02:58:07,485
[SPEAKER_10]: I could have released them at any point, but you know, I just don't care.

2610
02:58:07,845 --> 02:58:11,690
[SPEAKER_10]: Instead, I'm just going to release them all at once, so it really doesn't matter to me.

2611
02:58:11,770 --> 02:58:12,711
[SPEAKER_10]: He doesn't bother me at all.

2612
02:58:13,552 --> 02:58:21,241
[SPEAKER_10]: Him with his announcer packs in high-quality, high-res banners, because that's all he can rip from the poor DDR disks.

2613
02:58:23,018 --> 02:58:23,919
[SPEAKER_22]: How did he even get them?

2614
02:58:25,060 --> 02:58:26,461
[SPEAKER_22]: It's just the same way I get them.

2615
02:58:26,501 --> 02:58:28,062
[SPEAKER_10]: You just rip them from the arcade disc.

2616
02:58:28,143 --> 02:58:29,804
[SPEAKER_10]: You know someone, you get to this image.

2617
02:58:30,525 --> 02:58:31,105
[SPEAKER_10]: Whoop-de-doo.

2618
02:58:31,465 --> 02:58:32,987
[SPEAKER_10]: So off of his Korean 2-disc.

2619
02:58:33,007 --> 02:58:33,487
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, guess what?

2620
02:58:33,587 --> 02:58:34,808
[SPEAKER_10]: I own an official one!

2621
02:58:35,469 --> 02:58:35,989
[SPEAKER_10]: Not that I care.

2622
02:58:36,069 --> 02:58:36,430
[SPEAKER_10]: Whatever.

2623
02:58:37,190 --> 02:58:37,791
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, go ahead.

2624
02:58:38,291 --> 02:58:39,292
[SPEAKER_10]: Release your banners and stuff.

2625
02:58:39,372 --> 02:58:40,613
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll release my site with 2,000 DWIs on it.

2626
02:58:44,482 --> 02:58:44,882
[SPEAKER_13]: My Yahoo win.

2627
02:59:00,083 --> 02:59:01,024
[SPEAKER_13]: You guys can talk offline.

2628
02:59:01,204 --> 02:59:01,724
[SPEAKER_13]: Set that all up.

2629
02:59:02,485 --> 02:59:07,728
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, one other quick thing I want to talk about before we go off the air tonight is waste of time websites.

2630
02:59:07,748 --> 02:59:09,049
[SPEAKER_13]: Because we were talking about Neopets.com.

2631
02:59:09,069 --> 02:59:10,170
[SPEAKER_13]: Neopets is not a waste of time.

2632
02:59:10,190 --> 02:59:11,411
[SPEAKER_07]: What a fucking waste of time.

2633
02:59:11,471 --> 02:59:12,772
[SPEAKER_13]: What a fucking waste of time.

2634
02:59:14,133 --> 02:59:15,394
[SPEAKER_13]: It's worse than Animal Crossing.

2635
02:59:18,823 --> 02:59:21,684
[SPEAKER_10]: This site is the best website ever.

2636
02:59:22,244 --> 02:59:25,745
[SPEAKER_10]: It's maddox.xmission.com.

2637
02:59:26,325 --> 02:59:30,526
[SPEAKER_10]: It's maddox.xmission.com.

2638
02:59:30,906 --> 02:59:38,268
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's got the crazy guy who rants about different things, and he has some really funny ones on there.

2639
02:59:38,948 --> 02:59:40,429
[SPEAKER_10]: So definitely check those out.

2640
02:59:41,289 --> 02:59:46,475
[SPEAKER_10]: Another one that's funny is one that Vandalist posted in the Sakimani forums.

2641
02:59:46,836 --> 02:59:50,139
[SPEAKER_07]: The one where they had the little Mario-like video that the guy made.

2642
02:59:51,020 --> 02:59:56,026
[SPEAKER_13]: It was called like, Mac Daddy Mario was the topic on Sakimani.

2643
02:59:56,547 --> 03:00:01,713
[SPEAKER_13]: And the guy actually went and made a bunch of little videos and movies using Nintendo characters.

2644
03:00:02,854 --> 03:00:03,774
[SPEAKER_07]: It's actually pretty cool.

2645
03:00:03,814 --> 03:00:11,579
[SPEAKER_07]: They have like one Mario's dancing to like disco music and then Peach comes up to him and they start dancing together.

2646
03:00:11,659 --> 03:00:13,601
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's actually pretty good, if not kind of cheesy.

2647
03:00:16,883 --> 03:00:21,026
[SPEAKER_22]: TheSmokingGun.com It's news, but it's really cool.

2648
03:00:21,746 --> 03:00:22,287
[SPEAKER_22]: And The Onion.

2649
03:00:23,327 --> 03:00:27,550
[SPEAKER_13]: A new one that came up this week, NationStates.net Yes, Dan does that.

2650
03:00:27,610 --> 03:00:28,731
[SPEAKER_13]: Have you made your nation yet?

2651
03:00:29,512 --> 03:00:31,433
[SPEAKER_22]: I haven't yet, but Dan's done his Gunstaria.

2652
03:00:33,059 --> 03:00:33,400

2665
03:01:02,037 --> 03:01:05,002
[SPEAKER_22]: We would create our countries and run it and everything and then we'd have a war.

2666
03:01:06,633 --> 03:01:22,744
[SPEAKER_10]: That was funny, is the way my country, or we did this thing in sociology, like, you know, trying to depict the best way society should be run, and the way it would work the best, and mine ended up turning into, like, oh, I don't know, neo-Nazism.

2667
03:01:23,584 --> 03:01:25,385
[SPEAKER_10]: That's the way mine was, but it worked.

2668
03:01:25,826 --> 03:01:26,346
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

2669
03:01:26,886 --> 03:01:27,807
[SPEAKER_14]: Maybe there's something to it.

03:01:30,487 --> 03:01:32,128
[SPEAKER_22]: I probably have a nice social estate.

2671
03:01:34,669 --> 03:01:38,370
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, I think we ought to wrap up the show now, because we're running over a little bit.

03:01:38,410 --> 03:01:40,851
[SPEAKER_22]: We're going to do the nation of Pacmania.

2673
03:01:41,531 --> 03:01:41,791
[SPEAKER_13]: That's cool.

2674
03:01:41,811 --> 03:01:42,992

2675
03:01:44,432 --> 03:01:44,992
[SPEAKER_13]: That's cool.

2676
03:01:45,493 --> 03:01:46,293

2677
03:01:46,313 --> 03:01:47,833
[SPEAKER_22]: And the national animal be the ghost monster.

2678
