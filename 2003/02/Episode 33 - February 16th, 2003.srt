1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,980
What's wrong?

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:37,000
in this episode.

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I'm sorry, but all questions must be submitted in writing.

4
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Why did they have to take the word gay?

5
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
No! What I expect from Spanish expressions is gay too.

6
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Hey!

7
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Dark Sakura.

8
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Shut up!

9
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Where's my gun?

10
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
This is my boom stick.

11
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Sky.

12
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Come on girls, it's time to drop the bomb.

13
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Loki.

14
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I can't, for the life of me, get the hooker to have sex with me.

15
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
What kind of war human being would find that funny?

16
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Orange Lounge Radio

17
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Let's get the intros out of the way.

18
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
All you people who are downstairs!

19
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000

Loki.

23
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Ah, stupid McDonald's.

24
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
It feels like there's a balloon in my stomach.

25
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
And that's no good.

26
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Ugh.

27
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000

31
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,640

32
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:57,640
music.

33
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:56,640
So kick, yo-yo, get low, rock hot.

34
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,640
The King!

35
00:03:58,640 --> 00:03:59,540
Yo, Joe!

36
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:42,460
What?!

37
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:43,960
Hey!

38
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:17,020
I'm a believer, I'm a believer, I'm a believer

39
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:44,460
Oh

40
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:23,100
I think you have my feelings But I'm so far away from you

41
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:29,980
I think you have my feelings But I'm so far away from you

42
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:32,980
I think you have my feeling

43
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:35,980
My heart's so far away for me

44
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:38,980
Hey, can I feel it that way?

45
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:41,980
Hey, can I just go for you?

46
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:45,980
It's time to say goodnight, goodnight, baby

47
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:47,980
I want you, love

48
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:50,980
I'm ready to be empty

49
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:54,980
It's my time for you to say goodnight

50
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:59,980
Last name for you, you're the last to let me get to me

51
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:04,980
You're the last, last name for you, I can't wait for

52
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:07,980
I don't need any of your heart

53
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:14,980
I'm not in love, I'm not in love

54
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:19,980
I'm not in love, I'm not in love

55
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:56,980
Hi, this is Mel B of RTF, and for an extra $1.99 a minute, my girlfriend Mel B can join

56
00:09:57,820 --> 00:10:02,540

57
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:06,940
to the one place that costs absolutely nothing to go to and still the fun is just as great.

58
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:11,780
It's Orange Lounge Radio, Sunday nights. Take it with me and you just might realize the

59
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:18,780
best things in life are free. We're back, we're live, and people are still playing Animal

60
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:20,780
I'm playing Animal Crossing, but that's okay.

61
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:22,780
You can do your Animal Crack.

62
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:23,780
Yeah, Animal Crack.

63
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:25,780
We have one of our special guests up here, though.

64
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:26,780
Say hi.

65
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:27,780
Yo, what's up?

66
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:29,780
This is Jay Kinetic representing Step Squad in the Bay Area.

67
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:31,780
How you doing, Jamie?

68
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:33,780
I'm on my way to intoxication.

69
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:38,780
I see that you're already a glass ahead of me.

70
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:39,780
That's right.

71
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:43,780
Yeah, I got some Sky Vodka and Amp, actually a very good mix, and I just got the pleasure

72
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:46,780
of coming out here to hang out tonight.

73
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:56,780
Jessica and Ross are downstairs looking at Animal Crack. We've been trying to get them on a 12-step program for that, but they just won't go to the meetings. It's been really messed up.

74
00:10:56,780 --> 00:11:03,780
Ah! There's a microphone in my face! Shit! Yeah, Sky Vodka.

75
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:09,780
I'll take phrases that Mariah Carey's gotten used to for 500. Ah! There's a microphone in my face!

76
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:14,780
That was wrong. And how are you doing tonight?

77
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:20,780
I was doing good until I ate something and that something happened to be McDonald's and then McDonald's is ripping me up.

78
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:24,780
What you want is what you vomit at McDonald's today.

79
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:30,780
Yes. McDonald's is going to need a PR campaign to undo all the damage you just did.

80
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:38,780
Well actually yesterday I wasn't feeling too good either or the day before because I made this spaghetti with this really cool sauce I got off the internet.

81
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:43,540
off the internet, like this recipe off of Robert and I don the radio show I listen to

82
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:50,340
every morning and it was really good but the thing is that it calls for two full bulbs

83
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:55,700
of garlic ground up along with a large red onion so you have pretty much like this half

84
00:11:55,700 --> 00:12:00,340
of it is onion and garlic and then the rest is all tomatoes and stuff and it's really

85
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:01,340
good.

86
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:05,740
The problem is when you have that much garlic you just eat a little bit of it and it makes

87
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:10,360
your stomach really really gassy so well actually no the problem is you'll need

88
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:13,400
about three bottles of Listerine after you eat two bulbs of garlic and a red

89
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:16,520
onion I mean God you could probably breathe on somebody and it's probably

90
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:24,600
like toxic yeah so it was really good it just it felt like you just a little bit

91
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:27,800
of it you feel like full already and it's it's weird so we're just feeling

92
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:32,520
you just feel full I don't know now the worst time I had was when I prepared

93
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:38,080
some spaghetti. I was cooking for my ex at the time and she'd come over and I was cooking

94
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:44,420
and I threw something that wasn't tobacco into the spaghetti sauce along with some alcohol.

95
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:47,860
I didn't feel the effects for the first 30 minutes. I sat down to use my computer after

96
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:51,860
she went home and all of a sudden they hit me like Vicodin and I was out. It was scary.

97
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:56,580
Oh, there's Shermy if you look very slowly. Oh, she just went back under the thing. Shermy

98
00:12:56,580 --> 00:13:01,660
decided to peek out and say hi to everybody but then she went back under the bed. Oh,

99
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:03,660
Baby

100
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:09,820
So what's the topic tonight anyway topic the topic is Robert here party time

101
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:15,200
Yeah, he decided to get down to that cyber beat nation thing. You know, huh?

102
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:20,620
You know, they said like there's never a topic on the show come up here melody

103
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:25,820
Yeah, we have our models in here tonight a dark soccer Melodies on her way up

104
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:29,360
She's having a hard time getting up the stairs because the ammo crack is calling her say hi melody

105
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:33,360
No, I'm having a hard time coming up the stairs because I'm half drunk.

106
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,360
That's the reason why.

107
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:35,360
Lightweight!

108
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:36,360
Lightweight!

109
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:40,680
Yes, I'm a lightweight, and I'm damn proud of it, okay?

110
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:42,680
That means I'm a cheap date.

111
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:46,000
Ooh, shout out to Mel down in Cyberbeat Nation.

I was just so pretty thrilled that Rob beat Ree at Fremont

136
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:55,520
True, true. Respect the Tigger, though, because that's one of the coolest P.A.ers I've met.

00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,520
You never got an ego about this shit. Shouts to him.

Okay. Um, Freestyle.

139
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:03,520
It was a total NorCal showing, except for, like, one person.

140
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:07,520
Um, in fourth place, our very own Step Squad Boy, Wendell.

Yay, AJ!

144
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:18,520
In second place, I think I got this right because I could barely hear Rob when he told me Master 42.

145
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:20,520
If I have that wrong, I'll correct it.

146

148
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:48,400
that's a pretty good showing there for a for a NorCal so no no no we have to we

149
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:53,200
have to be nice to our out-of-state people because keep in mind I lived in

150
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:56,540
Alabama where we had no Bimani when I went there to visit April you know they

151
00:15:56,540 --> 00:16:04,600
had a Korean dance maniacs oh my god down in Newark down at Newark in New

152
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:09,680
Park Mall I think Ross was with me when I played this they have dance maniacs in

153
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:14,300
Korean it could dance freaks in Korean I've never played this game before I was

154
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:18,140
I was amazed by this. I'm like, they have Korean songs with us? Didn't they have a

155
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:19,820
Cleon, Funky tonight or something?

156
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:22,500
No, they didn't have Funky tonight. They had another Clon song.

157
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:27,260
They had another Clon song. They had a Big Young song. Big Young,

158
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:30,560
as we all know, did a Budong from DDR.

159
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:34,820
And so she has a song called Dash on Dance Freaks. And I was just amazed. I was like,

160
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:36,020
wow, and it's only a quarter!

161
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:39,780
Dude! Yeah, this thing is cheap. It's the winner, dude. It's the winner. Now if, like, people in New

162
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:41,660
Park Mall could quit bar hopping, life would be great.

163
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:48,300
Well, they had one at the fair last year, the year before.

164
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:54,000
I found out that they recently got a Beatmania, an actual Beatmania machine, just in the hallway

165
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,540
at the mall outside the movie theater that the mall I used to work at, which, from what

166
00:16:58,540 --> 00:17:01,840
I understand it correctly, is actually where my arcade used to be, but they moved the arcade

167
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:02,840
further down.

168
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:05,960
Yeah, in Latin's Castle.

169
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:08,920
I worked for Namco at one time.

170
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:11,240
average at uh... at uh...

171
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:13,360
said his own

172
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:15,320
presentation

173
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:19,020
earlier of this show this uh... so far as well as it brought to you by islanders

174
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:23,320
cricket i special brew a unique ball beverage national flit flavors

175
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:24,960
that's open for it gets you

176
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:27,840
locked up

177
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:29,240
it's

178
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:32,080
he just wouldn't let me by the slits i want to show it

179
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:36,520
i want to show that i want to represent it's let me know you know you know

180
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:40,320
What you need is an ice-cold Colt.45.

181
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:43,000
You know, if you didn't have that, I would've, I would've, like, you would've let me!

182
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:47,920
Somewhere Billy Dee Williams is having a cry. I know, I know he is.

183
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:52,920
You're being awfully... He's just so smooth. You're being awfully quiet.

184
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:56,920
Yeah, that's because I feel like a blimp. I feel fat.

185
00:17:56,920 --> 00:18:00,520
And sassy. And sassy.

186
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:02,520
I'm feeling hot and sassy!

187
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:35,520
video comes from, what you need is an ice cold Colt.45.

188
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:39,040
Worst commercial ever, it's not like it made anybody look bad or anything. I mean, Colt

189
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:43,640
.45, Schlitz, Red Dog, all those urban beers, I don't think I've ever touched one just because

190
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:47,400
they taste like water and piss. You know, when I lived in, I lived in the

191
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:57,120
hood at one time. Del Paso Heights. I mean, you could tell at one time, maybe back in

192
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:02,700
it was a nice neighborhood but the the place was all like you know the houses

193
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:06,500
were there were some you know HUD houses and dogs running down the street people

194
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:10,180
go down with their loud bass I'm trying to sleep before the morning and on New

195
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:16,260
Year's Eve our friend Tina we call her beanie she came over while we were

196
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:19,820
having our big automate marathon we're watching um what were we watching

197
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:25,340
cowboy bebop and we were playing somebody amigo and she brought me a 40

198
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:31,740
Corona and said and I but I felt inclined to go drink it on my couch but

199
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:39,260
I didn't have chairs or a couch so yeah that's the sad thing I mean I'm from the

200
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:43,460
slums like originally spent like half of my existence in Oakland California and

201
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:47,580
what's sad about Oakland is that there are three things that you will find in

202
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:52,580
most neighborhoods and that's a liquor store a nail a nail shop and like a

203
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:56,980
a church. You'll find those all within a black proximity of each other.

204
00:19:56,980 --> 00:20:01,480
There are five churches by my house in DPH. You don't need five churches in one

205
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:02,840
neighborhood, that's scary.

206
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:07,360
But we saw this and they'd all be selling the most crappy beers on the planet. We're

207
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:08,500
talking like Natural

208
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:12,920
Ice and like Schlitz and like Red Dog. You name it and it's a kettle beer that you

209
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:15,400
probably saw in the advertisement for and the source, they had it.

210
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:19,180
And it was just bad and you knew it was a rig up. But you couldn't do anything about it.

211
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:25,180
So I guess the idea was you drank your Mad Dog 2020 and went to church because that was the only way you could put up with the people there. I'm not sure.

212
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:30,180
Well, you know what? It's funny that we're talking about alcohol on a Bimani show.

213
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:31,180
Yeah!

214
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:34,180
Have you ever tried to play DDR drunk?

215
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:41,180
I'm happy to say that I got a ton of perfects while I was off of four TGI Friday drinks, despite the fact that they were weak.

216
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:45,180
I was not drunk enough yet, so I went to the store, got two pints of Sopetto beer. Good stuff.

217
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:49,440
stuff. Went out to the DDR machine and was scoring B's and A's all day. It's all about

218
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,280
drunk-drunk revolution.

219
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:58,200
First night I met Wendell at Fauna Mae of 2001. He proceeded to beat Afrinova Maniac

220
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:05,520
while drunk. And I don't think he's been able to do it sober, right? That was awesome.

221
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:11,160
I'm not quite sure. I would DDR naked with the right person, but you'd have to have a

222
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:13,640
private machine, because I don't want my wang flopping around.

223
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:17,640
We don't have upskirt can, thank you very much. I have played DDR in my pajamas.

224
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:21,640
But, if you're a woman playing DDR without a bra, it's painful.

225
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:22,640
Yeah, I can imagine.

226
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:27,640
And when we do have our private machine, no one will be playing Naked Naked Revolution on it.

227
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:32,640
Why not? Doubles Maniac could get really fun if you had two cute people.

228
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:35,640
That's the moment I go, woo!

229
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:40,640
Well anyway, how about our sim update, or is there a lack thereof today?

230
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:49,480
Actually, there's quite a bit going on. New StepMania, our new CVS update for the, what

231
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:57,720
was it, February 12th CVS snapshot for that. They're really making it sort of like, it's

232
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:03,560
becoming more of an actual arcade type, you know, program. You can actually probably put

233
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:07,220
it in an arcade machine and run it and it'd be like an arcade machine. You can actually

234
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:11,700
have now, they have options to disable all the options screens and whatnot so you can

235
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:17,000
actually play. And they have, you can hook up, you know, coins stuff to it and it's really

236
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:22,580
cool. They also have added like, you know, Marvelous' and a whole bunch of new modifiers

237
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:27,020
on there now. They have one that's called Land which is just like in the Oni course

238
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:33,400
trick. It's got a, it's kind of a reverse boost where it slows way down. They have one

239
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:40,560
called Expand where it kind of just expands and contracts as it goes up the screen and

240
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:45,820
then they've got, man, they've got a bunch of weird stuff but it's all like kind of stuff

241
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:52,540
inspired by DDR Extreme, they'll be kind of putting a lot of new things in there. Supposedly

242
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:57,280
there's supposed to be 2DX and BeatMania support added in but I haven't seen anything about

243
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:03,760
that yet. But, yeah, that stuff's coming up. Still working on my website. I'm taking my

244
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:09,320
time though because I'm going to be adding CD titles to everything and just making sure

245
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:15,040
it's, you know, fully done that way. I have a full set of DDRxtreme sim files that will

246
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:23,040
be coming up. Everything that's released so far, of course. And then, let's see what else.

247
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:25,040
Oh, I don't know, a whole bunch of shit.

248
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:34,040
Oh, DWI Insanity, they just released a U-Trans number 2 non-stop DWI.

249
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:36,040
It's 35 minutes long.

250
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:38,040
You can play it last night.

251
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:42,040
After about 20 minutes, your hand just...

252
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:44,040
It doesn't hurt anymore, but...

253
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:45,040
Yeah, that was pretty fun.

254
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:47,040
And then, let's see, other than that,

255
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:57,040
Other than that, Bhimani Cell switched to a new server thanks to kind donations from the community and so they should be bringing up more SIM files on that site too.

256
00:23:57,040 --> 00:24:07,040
Probably see the rest of the DDRXtreme stuff come up and same with DDRUK, they've just re-put up all their new stuff on new server so check those out also.

257
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:19,040
Aside from that, just keep watching DDR Maniacs and Bobonni Sims and you'll find some more sim files and keep waiting to hear about my website which should be coming up as soon as I work on it.

258
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:21,040
That's it.

259
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:24,040
We should also make a mention about our contest.

260
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:46,040
Our old TV themed DWI contest, we don't really have a due date yet, but it's going to be done to any old TV theme, only TV themes. Or were we doing just TV themes? Yeah, so old TV themes, DWI. No remixes. Original TV themes.

261
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:51,040
I want to see some of those TV themes. I want to see, like, Greatest American Hero.

262
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:57,040
I want to see Silver Spoons. I want to see the A-Team. If somebody did one to Small Wonder, that'd be crazy.

263
00:24:57,040 --> 00:25:01,040
I looked for the Small Wonder theme to play on the pre-show, and I couldn't find it.

264
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:07,040
I've only got one TV theme that's actually into a DWI, and that's an Ash Bridges theme.

265
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:12,040
Damn. You know what one would be fun? I just thought of Bonanza.

266
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:15,040
duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh banana

267
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:19,040
I am a banana!

268
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:23,040
My suit is too big!

269
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:25,040
You're watching a family learning channel.

270
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:29,040
You!

271
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:31,040
My guy, Airwolf.

272
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:32,040
Yes!

273
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:36,040
No, no, I just had it. The Price is Right would be a good one.

274
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:40,040
The other one that I wanted to see. God, it was just in my brain.

275
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:43,040
The years of marijuana fucked me up.

276
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:47,440
Batman would be pretty cool. They're throwing him out in the chat room now.

277
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:51,120
We've got the chat room up here live. If you had already joined the chat room, what server are they on?

278
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:54,280
It's

279
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:58,120
otherside.irc.net

280
00:25:58,120 --> 00:26:02,800
Just go to orangeloungelounge.skie.cx

281
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:07,560
and there's a link there to our channel. If you want one that's kind of a related

282
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:12,640
TV hip-hop theme to New York undercover, kick-ass intro music, use that.

283
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:15,720
WKRP

284
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:20,780
I am! Okay. MASH! We're taking a special break right now

285
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:23,880
because you just freakin' named the show.

286
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:27,920
Give me a second, I have this here. I have the full version of this.

287
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:31,920
We're taking a break. WKRP in Cincinnati.

288
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:01,920
Cincinnati WKRP

289
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:05,920
Got kinda tired of packin' and unpackin'

290
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:09,920
Town to town, up and down the dial

291
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:13,920
Maybe you and me were never meant to be

292
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:17,920
Just maybe think of me once in a while

293
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:32,480
And that's enough of that, yes the WKRP in Cincinnati theme.

294
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:33,480
You know what?

295
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:37,800
I was, I don't know how old I was when that show was on, it was like, there's Shermy!

296
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:40,080
Oh, she's back under bed.

297
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:43,240
Shermy decided there were too many people downstairs and came up here.

298
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:45,880
Um, saved by the fucking bell.

299
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:50,880
You know, what's-her-face from that show went on to be in Showgirls and show her boobs and her ass to the world?

300
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,880
Elizabeth Berkley.

301
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,880
Well, so did Tiffany Amber Thiessen.

302
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:57,880
She's stupid, though.

303
00:27:57,880 --> 00:28:02,880
I don't know, a bunch of crap. She was on Beverly Hills 90210.

304
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:04,880
I'm sure she got naked at some point.

305
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:10,880
I know. I'm sure she's a slut. Yeah.

306
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:13,880
So if you were on Saved by the Bell, then you'd have to turn into a hoe.

307
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:15,880
You know Kim Fields was in a Belvedevo video?

308
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:49,880
You can tell that the character, it went through her mind that, you know, she's gonna have sex with this, like, 16-year-old kid.

309
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:55,880
So, you know, she was a slut in that, too, so... I don't know. But she sucked.

310
00:28:55,880 --> 00:29:02,880
Elizabeth, uh, Berkley. She's played everything that she's been, and she's been, like, a slut.

311
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:07,880
Dude, okay. Now, I admit she was hot back in the day on Saved by the Bell, okay? Long way ch- you know, she was alright looking.

312
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:10,880
Even though she was- I don't know if she was brown or blonde back then, but she was okay.

313
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:15,280
The thing that turned me off to Elizabeth Berkley was the pool scene in Showgirl.

314
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:20,580
Some of you remember this. I swear to God the woman was having a seizure because a light went bad in the freaking pool.

315
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:29,180
What the hell happened? I've been in bed a little bit. I have not seen anybody have an orgasm like that.

316
00:29:29,180 --> 00:29:33,780
If you have an orgasm like that, put a message out in the chat room. That was scary.

317
00:29:33,780 --> 00:29:36,380
I was afraid she was having a heart attack. I don't know what the hell happened.

318
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:41,380
she looked like a fucking shark grabbed onto his nuts like just thrashing in the

319
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:41,960
water

320
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:47,060
I don't know, it was weird. Oh my god, what the hell's going on?

321
00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:51,980
What the hell was wrong with her? God! You fucked him without

322
00:29:51,980 --> 00:29:56,460
fucking him! Okay, you kinda have to fuck them in order to fuck them

323
00:29:56,460 --> 00:30:01,460
but if you weren't fucking them, how were you fucking them?

324
00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:05,540
last week on orange and radio

325
00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:07,700
the whole movie is awful

326
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:10,500
every time i watched it like fall asleep

327
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:11,300
actually

328
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:12,280
scare your scene

329
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:15,720
i just saw this movie uh... i was watching it over at whose house was i

330
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:18,080
just over at the other day watching this

331
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:19,760
tony's my good friend tony

332
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:22,260
uh... kuno one two six was up to him

333
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:24,380
techy guy represents otaku outposts

334
00:30:24,380 --> 00:30:26,220
we saw this movie itu mama tambien

335
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:28,840
uh... and your mother's okay you've seen this

336
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:33,160
Okay, there's a scene, in the movie, two guys who are pretty close friends, right?

337
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:36,500
The movie gets wackier, so I still suggest you go out and see us.

338
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:39,840
Um, one of the parents, okay, one of the kids is kinda rich, the other one's kinda poor, but

339
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:42,960
let's still get down, I think the other kinda poor kid's middle class. Anyway,

340
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:47,040
they're at a country club, you know this scene, they're at a country club,

341
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:50,480
they're on two opposite diving boards talking, while

342
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:54,800
they're, you know, fapping. And it gets scarier because they go to a,

343
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:57,980
they go to a shot, it's bad enough that you see them fapping on the two diving boards

344
00:30:57,980 --> 00:30:59,660
at this country club in public

345
00:30:59,660 --> 00:31:00,980
but the killer scene

346
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:02,180
is when you see

347
00:31:02,180 --> 00:31:04,420
the spoons hit the water

348
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:06,220
they put this scene in the movie

349
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:09,740
why i don't want to see the spoons at the water

350
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:12,480
that's just not cool

351
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:14,700
here's an indicate he and i

352
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:16,020
too much information radio

353
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:20,140
well there's also the other scene where they started making out to the two guys

354
00:31:20,140 --> 00:31:22,660
are making out when they're with the one chick

355
00:31:22,660 --> 00:31:27,940
I want that movie. I like seeing guys make out. I mean, you're saying?

356
00:31:27,940 --> 00:31:33,700
I don't have a single problem with guys making out. If a guy's cute enough, I'd probably make out with him, but...

357
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:36,580
Okay, two guys making out, that's one thing.

358
00:31:36,580 --> 00:31:40,420
At that point in the movie, we didn't need to see, you know, they pretty much

359
00:31:40,420 --> 00:31:43,660
had it established, they were pretty homophobic. We did not need to see the

360
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:46,180
spooge hit the water.

361
00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:49,820
Mel just, Melody's in here now. Say hi, Melody.

362
00:31:49,820 --> 00:31:55,820
issues was just came in as i said that now she's got a shirt

363
00:31:55,820 --> 00:31:57,760
perhaps we should get back to it

364
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:00,260
said to uh... to the accident

365
00:32:00,260 --> 00:32:01,600
bt

366
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:03,660
and everything

367
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:05,440
and is having the end

368
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:09,600
mental image that i did not need

369
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:14,780
as a result of the heads up or with the tales that has foreign

370
00:32:14,780 --> 00:32:18,160
so formal is a good time to take a look at our take a look at the old samurai

371
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:22,160
There are some good foreign movies out there.

372
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:26,160
Um, Run Lola Run. That movie's kick-ass and that's foreign, you know?

373
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:30,160
It just depends on what you watch. I just don't want to see Spooge hit the water.

374
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:34,160
That just messed up my day.

375
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:37,160
Oh, man. There's nothing...

376
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:42,160
Why isn't there anything going on in the fucking Bamani community, other than the stupid tournament?

377
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:44,160
I mean...

378
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:52,160
Konami of Japan decided to, you know, pretty much rape us and shut down their, um, you know, American arcade division over here, if I'm correct.

379
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:58,160
Um, we haven't had out anything besides Eurobeat songs on DDR, I'm still waiting to find a machine that has the club mixes on it.

380
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:02,160
And, uh, you know, I'd really like for them to open up the code to that, although I don't think they will.

381
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:05,160
It'd be kinda cool if I could make my own DDR mix.

382
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:08,160
There's tons of songs on there, but hey, you know, that's why.

383
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:13,160
But I'm glad that there's nothing going on, because nothing going on means people are playing rather than starting drama, and that's a beautiful thing.

384
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:16,160
Because that means that there's less stupid people that I have to slap.

385
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:20,160
Actually, we're in the process of finding the code right now.

386
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:23,160
We have people working on it night and day.

387
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:25,160
Um, yeah, doing that kind of thing.

388
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:28,160
Actually, I'm getting closer and closer to being able to rip more stuff out of there.

389
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:33,160
I just got a thing to rip videos out of, um, PlayStation 2, uh, Bamani games.

390
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:34,160
I haven't...

391
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:38,160
Problem is, the program's Japanese, so I have no fucking clue what it wants me to do.

392
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:40,160
Is this the Fuck You show?

393
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:42,160
No, this is a real show.

394
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:46,160
Oh darn yeah, we're going to do the fuck yous later, okay?

395
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:49,120
I'll save it for then cuz I wanted I don't want to mess up anything

396
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:53,160
Dark soccer is cruising a really cool calm. I'm a boy government

397
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:57,120
Went to that I met him shortly after the destruction at MGL

398
00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:00,080
Thanks to a change Oh Phoenix and a bunch of the crazy MFS

399
00:34:00,460 --> 00:34:04,360
So go to that site be marks calm if you haven't already went there actually I think Phoenix is a door

400
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:07,800
Information gathering and news for them now to a really cool guy

401
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:13,000
down in L.A. What's up to him and Just Jay, Envision, other heads down there, Supply,

402
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,400
Jobstun, whatever the hell he is.

403
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:19,600
Well, it looks like, well, as far as new stuff coming out, I mean, it looks like GuitarFreak's

404
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:25,800
9th and Drummania 8th are supposed to be coming out next month, and, you know, you're gonna

405
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:31,000
have Beatmania 7th and the final coming out to PlayStation 2.

406
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:34,800
So is that Beatmania 7th the final mix for Beatmania, so I'm assuming that everything's

407
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:38,800
is going to be set to 2DX after that?

408
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:41,800
Yeah, it's pretty much, it's the final and 7th.

409
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:43,800
Hello, I totally forgot!

410
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:47,800
Another DDR Extreme code was released this week.

411
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:51,800
Unlocking a couple more non-SOC courses and more ONI courses.

412
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:54,800
Including in those ONI courses, they've got, you know,

413
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:58,800
Sakura is one of the playable songs in one of the ONI courses.

414
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:02,800
Along with, let's see what else, Xenon is in one of them.

415
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:16,800
And Dance Dance Revolution is in one of them, and finally in one of the non-stop courses, Heaven is 57 Gray. I forget the fucking song.

416
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:26,800
Honestly, if you are looking, I don't know how many heads have or haven't wanted to play it, if you haven't had a chance to play it yet, please go out and play Guitar Freaks.

417
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:30,220
it's an excellent game, and I feel it's kind of been slept on. There are a few people,

418
00:35:30,220 --> 00:35:34,940
you know, most people don't go between, don't go beyond DDR and I'd say Beatmania, but if

419
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:39,340
you have to expand to another element, definitely go Guitar Freaks. It's one of the most fun

420
00:35:39,340 --> 00:35:44,020
games I've had. Dancemania X is another fun one, I'll let you just mention that, but Guitar

421
00:35:44,020 --> 00:35:47,940
Freaks is one of my favorites. It has kick-ass music, you know, if you're into rock at all,

422
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:51,060
you know, plenty of stuff to make you want to jump around and just sit back with something

423
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:57,100
a little bit more laid back. Um. And then later, earlier this week, I gotta play more

424
00:35:57,100 --> 00:36:03,940
Qzar, cause that was fun. Heh heh heh. Same place? Yeah, same place. Played on the fifth

425
00:36:03,940 --> 00:36:10,460
mix in Max 2 again. That fifth mix is fucked up. Oh my god. It's just, all the paths don't

426
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:15,220
work. That's it. Nothing sucks more than when you go to an arcade and you've already dealt

427
00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:18,840
with somebody who's been talking to, uh, you know, a gang of shit, and you can't kick their

428
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:30,320
ass because the machine sucks. Yeah. What's that? Yay. Okay. Um, again guys, I'm really

429
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:35,280
sorry and thank you so much for, um, thank you so much for bearing with me on this. I'm

430
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:41,480
gonna go ahead and get, here, you talk. Don't bear with us. You're privileged to be listening

431
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:49,920
to us you will deal with any hardships that you yeah yeah give me that okay I'm going

432
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:56,920
um... to break

433
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:22,720
Play me for you, make it tough

434
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:25,720
Lying on your back, playing for rock n' stuff

435
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:28,520
Home as a boot camp, you gotta escape

436
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:30,920
All the trouble running from this, you gotta take it

437
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:35,120
You feel, you feel, you feel, you feel, you feel

438
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:37,920
You gotta be who you're sitting for

439
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:42,720
So young, so young, you need to do your thing

440
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:45,520
Who you're sitting for

441
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:47,520
Never had for a long day

442
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:50,520
But you're the one who knows the city more

443
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:53,520
It's like we're having a movie for a play

444
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:01,520
The heat is amazing, the heat is real

445

He cried Wanda, Wanda, Wanda, Wanda, Wanda, Wanda, yeah

477
00:42:47,260 --> 00:42:53,260
Wanda, Wanda, Wanda, Wanda, Wanda, Wanda, yeah

478
00:42:53,260 --> 00:42:58,260
Well, I feel proud now that the world is moving

479
00:42:58,260 --> 00:43:04,260
The energy is too much for me

480
00:43:04,260 --> 00:43:06,260
I'll see you every day

481
00:43:06,260 --> 00:43:10,260
I'll see you every day

482
00:43:10,260 --> 00:43:12,260
Every day

483
00:43:12,260 --> 00:43:16,260
I'll try to stay

484
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:18,260
Right away

485
00:43:20,260 --> 00:43:25,260
Wonder, wonder, wonder, wonder, wonder, wonder, yeah

486
00:43:25,260 --> 00:43:28,260
Baby, I'm the hero

487
00:43:28,260 --> 00:43:31,260
Baby, I've been all night

488
00:43:31,260 --> 00:43:46,260
Wonder, wonder, wonder, wonder, wonder, wonder, yeah

489
00:43:52,260 --> 00:43:55,260
That's right, so is Rick, joint one

490
00:43:55,260 --> 00:43:59,260
If wonder were words, communication would start to peak

491
00:43:59,260 --> 00:44:02,260
Body language is controlled by rhythm

492
00:44:02,260 --> 00:44:04,260
Music is the universal wave

493
00:44:04,260 --> 00:44:08,260
Feel this, feel me, huh, huh

494
00:44:08,260 --> 00:44:10,260
Think of this world without sound

495
00:44:10,260 --> 00:44:12,260
Can't even feel a heart pound

496
00:44:12,260 --> 00:44:15,260
Wasting time, wasting life, wasting self

497
00:44:15,260 --> 00:44:17,260
You're a media elf

498
00:44:17,260 --> 00:44:19,260
Show me your drum and I'll beat on it

499
00:44:19,260 --> 00:44:21,260
Where's the guitar? I'll shred it

500
00:44:21,260 --> 00:44:23,260
Show me your soul, want lose control

501
00:44:23,260 --> 00:44:25,260
And if you dance, can't be getting through this

502
00:44:25,260 --> 00:44:28,260
Yeah, that's right, come on

503
00:44:28,260 --> 00:44:34,260
I can't hear you. What? What? I can't feel you. What? C'mon. Throw it up.

504
00:44:34,260 --> 00:44:42,260
Get busy. Get busy. That's right. Here we go, y'all. Make music.

505
00:44:42,260 --> 00:44:46,260
Give me your time and I'll send it. Tell me your name and I'll say it.

506
00:44:46,260 --> 00:44:50,260
Put it to hell, I'll blow it. Last time when I hit an airfield.

507
00:44:50,260 --> 00:44:52,580
Place the mic I'll rip it

508
00:44:52,580 --> 00:44:54,700
Show me the club it's the one

509
00:44:54,700 --> 00:44:56,840
Give me a light I'll send it

510
00:44:56,840 --> 00:44:59,180
...I'll summon I and I'm back

511
00:44:59,180 --> 00:45:01,980
Where you from? Where you at? Where are you going?

512
00:45:01,980 --> 00:45:04,120

00:45:06,020 --> 00:45:07,640
And bring the heat yo

00:45:07,640 --> 00:45:10,420
Where you from? Where ya at? Where ya going?

516
00:45:10,420 --> 00:45:12,580
Just follow the beat

517
00:45:12,580 --> 00:45:14,660
Just follow the beats come on

518
00:45:14,660 --> 00:45:16,220
And bring the heat

519
00:45:16,220 --> 00:45:18,840
Where you from? Where ya at? Where ya going?

520
00:45:48,840 --> 00:46:00,840
Ooh, Santa, here is a season for you to fly from the far.

521
00:46:00,840 --> 00:46:11,840
Ooh, Santa, here is a season for you to fly from the far.

522
00:47:11,840 --> 00:47:23,040
Yay, we're back!

523
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:26,800
I'm on drink number four, which is more of that chocolate.

524
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:29,920
It's vanilla soy milk and Godiva liqueur.

525
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:32,880
How is it, Noldy?

526
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:37,440
It's gone now, I already drank it, it's really yummy, actually.

527
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:40,840
I'm about to work on that drink myself, I'm working through a mixture of apple juice and

528
00:47:40,840 --> 00:47:46,680
sky vodka right now so it's good it's good stuff um i already had two with amp in it

00:47:56,440 --> 00:48:07,840
good that's a really yummy drink ross fuck all right we don't know the other one tonari

532
00:48:07,840 --> 00:48:10,840
If you're ever in Sacramento, go to Toonari Sushi. Good stuff.

533
00:48:10,840 --> 00:48:16,840
Right by Dark Sakura's house. You can come and be on Orange Lounge Radio, too, if you're cool.

534
00:48:16,840 --> 00:48:24,840
We're all drinking, except for our designated host.

535
00:48:24,840 --> 00:48:30,840
Yeah, I'm staying sober, so I can be boring. I have to be the dull end of the show.

536
00:48:30,840 --> 00:48:34,840
I mean, are you strange or anything, Loki? Do you drink normally, or what's going on?

537
00:48:34,840 --> 00:48:36,840
No, I don't drink normally.

538
00:48:36,840 --> 00:48:38,840
Any particular reason or?

539
00:48:39,620 --> 00:48:42,260
Because I think I'll probably get violent and hurt people

540
00:48:43,860 --> 00:48:48,700
That's cool angry angry angry drunks suck. I've only experienced two don't come around me if you're an angry drunk

541
00:48:49,420 --> 00:48:53,000
We need to do is get you entirely shit-faced and take you to golf lab

542
00:48:54,700 --> 00:48:58,220
No get well actually no we don't want to give him shit face and take him to a strip bar one

543
00:48:58,220 --> 00:48:59,920
Yeah, golf land would be good

544
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:02,660
So he can murder all the silly stupid Roosevelt children

545
00:49:02,660 --> 00:49:06,940
Good video of that.

546
00:49:06,940 --> 00:49:10,620
I would pay money to see that.

547
00:49:10,620 --> 00:49:14,780
Yes, Mongo Child does rock.

548
00:49:14,780 --> 00:49:19,140
Melody and I have had Mongo Child two days in a row at the same place in Roseville, at

549
00:49:19,140 --> 00:49:20,700
Great Wall in Roseville.

550
00:49:20,700 --> 00:49:21,700
That was...

551
00:49:21,700 --> 00:49:22,700
Hi.

552
00:49:22,700 --> 00:49:23,700
Hi.

553
00:49:23,700 --> 00:49:24,700
Say hi.

554
00:49:24,700 --> 00:49:25,700
Hi.

555
00:49:25,700 --> 00:49:26,700
This is Iguana Girl.

556
00:49:26,700 --> 00:49:27,700
Oh, my God.

557
00:49:27,700 --> 00:49:28,700
Whee!

558
00:49:28,700 --> 00:49:32,180
She's been playing Animal Crack.

559
00:49:32,180 --> 00:49:35,180
She's, she's another one of our, our designated people.

560
00:49:37,180 --> 00:49:40,180
Cause we're, the rest of us are well on our way.

561
00:49:40,180 --> 00:49:45,180
I can stop playing the game as soon as I pay off another 500,000 bells.

562
00:49:47,180 --> 00:49:53,180
I'm waiting for the first report in, uh, the news from Animal Crossing that somebody ran into somebody on accident

563
00:49:53,180 --> 00:49:59,180
or had a speeding violation because they were waiting to get home to do something in Animal Crossing.

564
00:49:59,180 --> 00:50:05,180
Well, I have actually seen spots on the road that are like potholes or whatever that look like the little star in Animal Crossing.

565
00:50:05,180 --> 00:50:09,180
And the first thing that crossed my mind was, I need to get my shovel and dig it up.

566
00:50:09,180 --> 00:50:14,180
There's a serious addiction problem here. We're trying to get Melody and Jessica into a 12-step.

567
00:50:14,180 --> 00:50:19,180
We're working on that, but we haven't managed to do it today.

568
00:50:19,180 --> 00:50:26,100
You see, now, I almost, you know, I used to be like, no, I actually never really was like

569
00:50:26,100 --> 00:50:29,060
that, but, you know, sure, I'd want to get back, you know, so I could do shit on Animal

570
00:50:29,060 --> 00:50:34,260
Crossing, but that was until I learned about the wonders of turning back the internal clock,

571
00:50:34,260 --> 00:50:38,260
in to which case you could play days before and that kind of fun stuff.

572
00:50:38,260 --> 00:50:42,720
I'm on the live journal Animal Crossing community, and one person responds, will actually refer

573
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:45,420
to that as clock fondling.

574
00:50:45,420 --> 00:50:46,420
Greatest term ever.

575
00:50:46,420 --> 00:50:51,420
See, here's my problem with Animal Crossing. There's not enough violence in the damn game.

576
00:50:51,420 --> 00:50:56,420
For example, Tom Nook. That son of a bitch needs to get a bullet right between the eyes for how rude he is.

577
00:50:56,420 --> 00:51:02,420
I'm sick of that shit. Every time I've seen somebody go to that goddamn store, that asshole sits there,

578
00:51:02,420 --> 00:51:09,420
okay, oh, you wanna come into my store? You need to be able to snatch him from behind the counter and beat his ass in that game for being an asshole.

579
00:51:09,420 --> 00:51:11,420
Sick of this!

580
00:51:11,420 --> 00:51:14,420
He's like a little Chinese woman that's running the store.

581
00:51:14,420 --> 00:51:15,420
or

582
00:51:15,420 --> 00:51:16,420
oh

583
00:51:16,420 --> 00:51:17,420
oh

584
00:51:17,420 --> 00:51:18,420
you want verdict?

585
00:51:18,420 --> 00:51:19,420
you want verdict?

586
00:51:19,420 --> 00:51:24,980
and then you go upstairs and there's like two and it's like oh my god he screwed you

587
00:51:24,980 --> 00:51:25,980
okay that was dirty

588
00:51:25,980 --> 00:51:26,980
that was dirty

589
00:51:26,980 --> 00:51:31,740
but that's the truth man you need a punch button see if it was gta 3 vice city somebody

That's what I want in my house, is to make it a public toilet.

642
00:54:17,500 --> 00:54:18,500
Greatest room ever.

643
00:54:18,500 --> 00:54:23,960
Because the greatest thing you can have in your house in Animal Crossing is a porta-potty.

644
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:30,220
You know, we're missing The Simpsons, the 300th episode, with no cable.

645
00:54:30,220 --> 00:54:35,980
If you want the bathroom theme in your house, by the way, all you need is six toilets, the

646
00:54:35,980 --> 00:54:43,180
exotic screen, the exotic wall, the plaza tile, the trash can, and I think a cone, and

647
00:54:43,180 --> 00:54:44,180
a plant.

648
00:54:44,180 --> 00:54:46,900
And sadly enough, I remember what each of the items are.

649
00:54:46,900 --> 00:54:50,220
Because I really want to relive the experience of going to San Francisco and trying to find

650
00:54:50,220 --> 00:54:53,500
a public bathroom to use after getting drunk, you know?

651
00:54:53,500 --> 00:54:58,820
Nothing sticks out to me like trying to walk over the feces on the floor, and I really

652
00:54:58,820 --> 00:55:02,340
we want that public bathroom team in it

653
00:55:02,340 --> 00:55:04,420
process still done

654
00:55:04,420 --> 00:55:09,200
i don't have a fireplace by the way

655
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:12,900
he's holding termander

656
00:55:12,900 --> 00:55:15,380

i'm going to be playing something for everybody and

659
00:55:21,220 --> 00:55:24,140
going for a second time to talk to everybody for a minute

660
00:55:24,140 --> 00:55:26,240
we want to do

661
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:28,140
okay arm

662
00:55:28,140 --> 00:55:29,980
okay well

663
00:55:29,980 --> 00:55:32,940
was they thought it was funny and think of one of the brain that you have a

664
00:55:32,940 --> 00:55:34,220
policy

665
00:55:34,220 --> 00:55:38,220

00:55:53,660 --> 00:55:57,020
it's working out like mariah carey trying to go for second record contract

672
00:55:57,020 --> 00:56:03,340
Sony right now and speaking of Pokemon this is I've been collecting a CD series

Yay! It's over! Yeah, we have our Eurobeat hater in here.

677
00:58:35,660 --> 00:58:40,100
Yay! It's over! It's Pokemon and Eurobeat. It's like evil.

678
00:58:40,100 --> 00:58:46,020
I don't know. I was able to ignore the whole song. That was great.

679
00:58:46,020 --> 00:58:48,020
You can't find Digimon easy now.

680
00:59:16,020 --> 00:59:21,300
In fact, you can't even tell it because the URL is broken.

681
00:59:21,300 --> 00:59:27,500
As soon as my CD is freaking recognized, there we go.

682
00:59:27,500 --> 00:59:32,340
Yeah, I'm going to play something that if you've seen any of the Japanese Digimon,

683
00:59:32,340 --> 00:59:33,220
you'll recognize.

684
00:59:33,220 --> 00:59:40,220
It's a short track, so here you go, eventually.

685
01:01:03,220 --> 01:01:05,220
Fire

686
01:01:33,220 --> 01:01:53,300
I think we should go to our favorite part of the show, the fuck use of the week, yay!

687
01:01:53,300 --> 01:01:58,500
The fuck use of the week, here, I usually explain to you, it's your turn.

688
01:01:58,500 --> 01:02:00,060
This is where we get ranty.

689
01:02:00,060 --> 01:02:03,840
Oh wait, this is just another part of the show.

690
01:02:03,840 --> 01:02:08,300
This is where every week we take time to do a shout out to all those people that piss

691
01:02:08,300 --> 01:02:15,720
us off and all the things that inconvenience us because we're better than everyone else.

692
01:02:15,720 --> 01:02:16,720
That's about it.

693
01:02:16,720 --> 01:02:21,640
So, um, because, again, I can't play music in the background, we're gonna go to a brief

694
01:02:21,640 --> 01:02:27,840
break so all of you can PM me, yes, private message, or you can, um, email, uh, Orange

695
01:02:27,840 --> 01:02:33,900
Challenge Radio at yahoo.com and tell us about what pisses you off. If you want to say fuck

696
01:02:33,900 --> 01:02:39,080
you to somebody but you're too much of a wuss to do it yourself, tell us and we'll say it

697
01:02:39,080 --> 01:02:46,080
for you because we don't give a fuck. We're just going to go ahead and play some of our

698
01:02:46,080 --> 01:02:51,720
We're not gonna play um, we're just gonna go ahead and play some of our usual fuck you theme songs and and

699
01:02:51,720 --> 01:02:54,720
And then we'll come back and be Yanksti. So yeah.

700
01:03:21,720 --> 01:03:23,000
We gotta do spill momentum

701
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:24,440
If you need the right tools and methods

702
01:03:24,440 --> 01:03:26,520
Rise or waste, I can't be the winner of the market

703
01:03:26,520 --> 01:03:28,280
If we can't get with the maintenance center

704
01:03:28,280 --> 01:03:29,080
It all might fall

705
01:03:29,080 --> 01:03:30,840
You can do it now, you're back to tango power

706
01:03:30,840 --> 01:03:32,360
Yes already, take that ball

707
01:03:32,360 --> 01:03:33,480
It's hard, you can't take it all

708
01:03:33,480 --> 01:03:34,760
So drop the ball

709
01:03:36,520 --> 01:03:37,960
Yeah, drop the ball

710
01:03:39,960 --> 01:03:41,160
So drop the ball

711
01:03:42,920 --> 01:03:44,280
Let me see that ball

712
01:03:48,680 --> 01:03:50,200
Yeah, we gotta do spill momentum

713
01:03:50,200 --> 01:03:51,640
If you need a right to a convention

714
01:03:51,640 --> 01:03:53,140
Ride the wave and sometimes use the rhythm

715
01:03:53,140 --> 01:03:54,840
The march to the distance, we don't get with it

716
01:03:54,840 --> 01:03:56,060
The rain is scintillating, all right

717
01:03:56,060 --> 01:03:58,040
If we're ready to do it now, you're like a tango flower

718
01:03:58,040 --> 01:03:59,440
We had to arrange to take that fall

719
01:03:59,440 --> 01:04:01,440
And it's up to you to make that call

720
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:05,840
We drop the bomb

721
01:04:06,840 --> 01:04:08,840
We drop the bomb

722
01:04:10,340 --> 01:04:12,340
We drop the bomb

723
01:06:42,340 --> 01:06:56,340
I'm really bad

724
01:06:56,340 --> 01:07:02,340
I'm really bad

725
01:07:02,340 --> 01:07:04,340
Fuck you

726
01:07:34,340 --> 01:08:01,420
Well, um, that was our Music for Fuck You's of the Week.

727
01:08:01,420 --> 01:08:06,420
We'll go ahead and start with Loki for our angstyness.

728
01:08:08,420 --> 01:08:11,420
Alright. I'm so thrown off without music.

729
01:08:13,420 --> 01:08:16,420
No! Oh, God.

730
01:08:16,420 --> 01:08:23,420
Uh, no, see, um, I really only have, I don't have, I think I had FUs earlier this week,

731
01:08:23,420 --> 01:08:27,420
but, like, I've just been bored over the weekend, so I kind of forgot it.

732
01:08:27,420 --> 01:08:29,420
Anyways, I have two.

733
01:08:29,420 --> 01:08:36,340
start off with the last angsty one. F you to acid 3.0 for constantly crashing on me

734
01:08:36,340 --> 01:08:40,580
and at least I'm smart enough to save every now and then, but the thing keeps freezing

735
01:08:40,580 --> 01:08:47,740
up on me and that sucks. So, yeah, F you to that. And F you to freaking stupid old people

736
01:08:47,740 --> 01:08:51,880
to handicap license plates, okay? Just because you're fucking crippled because you got shot

737
01:08:51,880 --> 01:08:56,180
in the ass in Vietnam or whatever, you don't need to be driving 30 miles an hour slower

738
01:08:56,180 --> 01:09:02,660
and everyone else and you take up the close parking spaces and you walk slow and you suck.

739
01:09:02,660 --> 01:09:06,980
So, you know, I think what should actually happen is because, you know, a lot of these

740
01:09:06,980 --> 01:09:10,860
people with handicapped bumper stickers, you know, I see, they're not hobbling enough.

741
01:09:10,860 --> 01:09:13,860
I just want to take, you know, their fucking wheelchair and just like, you know, go over

742
01:09:13,860 --> 01:09:17,900
the back of their spine with it, you know, just, you know, make sure that they're crippled

743
01:09:17,900 --> 01:09:22,220
just enough because it, what the hell, okay, if you're really crippled and you're driving

744
01:09:22,220 --> 01:09:29,000
a car? That's like driving a car blind. I mean, I don't know. I hate old people and

745
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:34,960
I hate them with the stupid, uh, yeah, stickers. No, I don't like the people who are not handicapped

746
01:09:34,960 --> 01:09:40,160
and have handicapped stickers. Who just have them, or like borrow some family members just

747
01:09:40,160 --> 01:09:45,160
so they can get a front parking spot. That would work. Anyway, is that your Fuck You

748
01:09:45,160 --> 01:09:46,160
the week.

749
01:09:46,160 --> 01:09:47,160
Okay.

750
01:09:47,160 --> 01:09:51,340
Oh shit, they passed it to me.

751
01:09:51,340 --> 01:09:55,180
Alright, first of all, fuck you to everybody who's involved in like the mainstream hip

752
01:09:55,180 --> 01:09:56,680
hop community right now.

753
01:09:56,680 --> 01:10:00,260
I'm sick of all you bastards who put out a fucking song and then put it out six months

754
01:10:00,260 --> 01:10:01,660
later as a goddamn remix.

755
01:10:01,660 --> 01:10:05,140
I don't care for where I carry single on it, it sucks dick anyway.

756
01:10:05,140 --> 01:10:09,780
You fubu clad, stereotypical motherfuckers can almost suck my motherfucking I'll battle

757
01:10:09,780 --> 01:10:11,780

01:10:11,780 --> 01:10:13,140
I'm sick of all this shit.

759
01:10:13,140 --> 01:10:18,520
You motherfuckers talk shit all over MTV every five minutes, will not freestyle, battle anybody

760
01:10:18,520 --> 01:10:22,500
worth a shit, and I'll go on record and say this, 50 Cent sounds like Mike Tyson with

761
01:10:22,500 --> 01:10:25,380
Down syndrome, but he's supposed to be the highest act out there.

762
01:10:25,380 --> 01:10:26,380
Fuck you.

763
01:10:26,380 --> 01:10:29,420
All these motherfuckers in the underground who've tried year after year after year to

764
01:10:29,420 --> 01:10:34,660
get put on, can't get put on because all of you fucking cocksucking bastards up at MTV

765
01:10:34,660 --> 01:10:38,060
won't put on anything except for Real World and anything that'll get a fucking fashion

766
01:10:38,060 --> 01:10:39,060
brand out there.

767
01:10:39,060 --> 01:10:40,800
Fuck all you fascist bitches.

768
01:10:40,800 --> 01:10:44,940
All the goddamn stupid-ass students at my fucking school will not listen to me when they're in class

769
01:10:44,940 --> 01:10:48,120
It's in the back of the class and don't do shit. I'm sitting there

770
01:10:48,120 --> 01:10:50,200
I give you 13 pages and notes to pass the test

771
01:10:50,200 --> 01:10:55,340
You can't even read that shit learn something besides all the members of b2k you stupid motherfuckers

772
01:10:55,480 --> 01:11:01,200
Fuck the president of North Korea because his dumb ass shouldn't be building nuclear weapons when he can't spell blockbuster

773
01:11:01,200 --> 01:11:04,120
Even though he has a fucking collection the size of a small state

I don't like women with fake breasts. Oh, wait, I was married to one at one point, but

795
01:12:12,040 --> 01:12:13,520
I don't like women with fake breasts.

796
01:12:13,520 --> 01:12:20,520
It's like Anna Nicole Smith saying she has good taste in makeup.

797
01:12:21,600 --> 01:12:26,380
I'd just like to say a massive fuck you to every single goddamn person who waits until

798
01:12:26,380 --> 01:12:32,680
the fucking last minute to buy their Sherry's Berries so that they can get something special

799
01:12:32,680 --> 01:12:36,760
for their loved ones, and they wait until the day of

800
01:12:36,760 --> 01:12:40,200
so that they can say, oh, can you deliver this for me today?

801
01:12:40,200 --> 01:12:45,040
No, fuck you! We did everything through FedEx, you're too goddamn late,

01:12:52,360 --> 01:12:56,160
I don't really have any right now, I'm too happy and drunk.

805
01:12:56,160 --> 01:13:00,360
Hang on, we're seeing if Ross doesn't fuck you.

806
01:13:00,360 --> 01:13:02,360
Ross is now fuck you I

807
01:13:03,880 --> 01:13:10,080
Got another fuck you fuck Sega for stopping making Dreamcast. I'm not buying another game from you

808
01:13:10,080 --> 01:13:12,040
I'll be burning your shit on the internet happily

809
01:13:12,040 --> 01:13:16,340
I will never pay for another Dreamcast game because you bastards didn't support the system kiss my ass

810
01:13:17,400 --> 01:13:18,760
actually

811
01:13:18,760 --> 01:13:23,960
Sega would not be in existence if they continue to support the system. They would be bankrupt. I am not kidding you

812
01:13:24,600 --> 01:13:29,520
They say they stopped producing the Dreamcast and stop supporting it so that they could stay alive as a company

813
01:13:29,520 --> 01:13:39,520
We would not have any more Sonic Team games, we would not have any new Knights, no new Sonic, no nothing, if they hadn't stopped their production of the Dreamcast. I thought I would just let you know that.

814
01:13:39,520 --> 01:13:41,520
Do you retract your fikey now?

815
01:13:41,520 --> 01:13:43,520
Yes, yes I do. That still sucks though.

816
01:13:43,520 --> 01:13:55,520
And F you to the stupid people on eBay, who I'm buying the freaking Mr. Science-ier 3000 movies for. Okay listen, I'm buying 46 movies for about, eh, it's going about $52 right now.

817
01:13:55,520 --> 01:13:58,920
Stop emailing me, you people, that I'm not bidding on your auctions.

818
01:13:58,920 --> 01:14:00,720
They're trying to sell me movies for $5 a piece.

819
01:14:00,720 --> 01:14:03,520
Listen, I'm buying taped movies because I can't...

820
01:14:03,520 --> 01:14:06,620
I already own all the ones that are legit, okay?

821
01:14:06,620 --> 01:14:09,520
Don't try to sell me legit shit. I already own it.

822
01:14:10,320 --> 01:14:12,620
Fuck you to you stupid-ass...

823
01:14:13,120 --> 01:14:17,220
AIDS-infected, cocksucking motherfuckers who spam email people.

824
01:14:17,220 --> 01:14:21,720
I get sick of going to my goddamn account and having to delete 135 messages

825
01:14:21,720 --> 01:14:27,040
because you guys can't stop telling me about ink cartridges and penis enlargement programs.

826
01:14:27,040 --> 01:14:29,320
Look, if my dick was small, your wife wouldn't like it.

827
01:14:29,320 --> 01:14:33,200
Quit fucking emailing me.

828
01:14:33,200 --> 01:14:36,480
Just a side note on that one, does anybody ever notice that the females always get the

829
01:14:36,480 --> 01:14:40,520
ones for the dick enlargements, and the women, or the guys always get the ones for the boob

830
01:14:40,520 --> 01:14:41,520
enlargements?

831
01:14:41,520 --> 01:14:42,520
Say motherfucking words.

832
01:14:42,520 --> 01:14:43,520
Exactly.

833
01:14:43,520 --> 01:14:47,080
I think I just deleted something out of my box today, it's all teal shark 39.

834
01:14:47,080 --> 01:14:48,080
Enhance your penis naturally.

835
01:14:48,080 --> 01:14:52,080
Wow, if I'm enhancing my penis, I've got a lot of issues right there.

836
01:14:52,080 --> 01:14:59,080
I swear, there was one guy who actually did an interview where he stated that he was happy spamming because he got paid.

837
01:14:59,080 --> 01:15:04,080
If I see you on the street, I'm going to stomp your motherfucking nut sack, and then I'm going to drop an elbow on your fucking nose and kill you.

838
01:15:04,080 --> 01:15:07,080
Darksack was in the bathroom and I'm going to give it to Loki.

839
01:15:07,080 --> 01:15:11,080
And just so you know, spammers, I am happy with my breast size.

840
01:15:11,080 --> 01:15:17,720
So, so stop sending me emails and like all the weird ones like they send you, you just

841
01:15:17,720 --> 01:15:23,880
won this! You just won that! And as funny as I, all the um, all the websites I go on

842
01:15:23,880 --> 01:15:29,840
to, I use different names, so like they'll send me like, hey Bob Bob, you just won da

843
01:15:29,840 --> 01:15:34,040
da da! You know what you're gonna win if I find you? A fucking hatchet to the head! I'm

844
01:15:34,040 --> 01:15:38,440
sick of this, every five seconds, live nude girls getting fucked by horses in the ass

845
01:15:38,440 --> 01:15:41,040
while they're being, you know, blown by a fucking seal.

846
01:15:41,040 --> 01:15:42,400
I don't want to see this shit!

847
01:15:42,400 --> 01:15:45,800
I'm going to do some kicky shit, but I'm not into live nude girls being fucked by horses.

848
01:15:45,800 --> 01:15:48,840
Quit mailing me this shit in my email, I'll get sick of it, I've got to delete, like,

849
01:15:48,840 --> 01:15:52,240
fifty messages. Want to see live nude girls? No! You want to see live nude girls!

850
01:15:52,240 --> 01:15:57,120
You're a 400-pound man sitting off in a goddamn room who hasn't seen a fucking pussy ever since you were born!

851
01:15:57,120 --> 01:15:59,560
Leave me the fuck alone!

852
01:15:59,560 --> 01:16:02,640
I've got another F.U. and I think this is one that Rob would be proud of.

853
01:16:02,640 --> 01:16:04,740
I'd like to say a massive F.U. for

854
01:16:04,740 --> 01:16:08,700
that the whoever the associates were at Fox that decided to freaking get rid of

855
01:16:08,700 --> 01:16:09,540
Frenchy

856
01:16:09,540 --> 01:16:13,420
the only goddamn talent that they've ever had

857
01:16:13,420 --> 01:16:16,620
we can't have her on the show because

858
01:16:16,620 --> 01:16:21,420
American Idol has so much dignity and she worked on a porn site half of you are looking at it

859
01:16:21,420 --> 01:16:22,620
right now

860
01:16:22,620 --> 01:16:25,860
back to the spam thing

861
01:16:25,860 --> 01:16:29,980
the best spam I have ever received I actually kept hello

862
01:16:29,980 --> 01:16:33,060
if you are a time traveler I'm going to need the following

863
01:16:33,060 --> 01:16:40,060
One, a modified mind-warping dimensional warp generator number 524350A series wristwatch with memory adapter.

864
01:16:40,060 --> 01:16:45,060
Two, reliable carbon-based or silicon-based time-transducing capacitor.

865
01:16:45,060 --> 01:16:51,060
I need a reliable source. Please only reply if you're reliable. Send a separate email to me and gives an address.

866
01:16:51,060 --> 01:16:53,060
What the hell?

867
01:16:53,060 --> 01:16:56,060
Quit smoking crack and sending these emails to us.

868
01:16:56,060 --> 01:17:00,060
I don't need to know about ink cartridges. I don't need to know about every porn site that your mom's on.

869
01:17:00,060 --> 01:17:04,260
moms on. I don't need to know this shit, but yet every single time I hit my email account,

870
01:17:04,260 --> 01:17:07,340
whether it's my, you know, domain I paid for where I shouldn't have to suffer through this,

871
01:17:07,340 --> 01:17:11,300
or my little bullshit yahoo account, I get 135 messages of this. If I find out who's

872
01:17:11,300 --> 01:17:12,660
spam mailing me, they're going to die.

873
01:17:12,660 --> 01:17:17,380
I check my email about eight times a day because of so much spam that's in there, I have to

874
01:17:17,380 --> 01:17:22,580
go and clean it out because I have a limited mailbox that can have, you know, mail-in.

875
01:17:22,580 --> 01:17:26,360
But I have to say, I think I mentioned this a couple weeks back, the most creative email

876
01:17:26,360 --> 01:17:30,180
I've ever gotten trying to get my personal information was they sent this email from

877
01:17:30,180 --> 01:17:37,080
an actual legit like Yahoo service in India, okay? And what it is, is it's saying, you

878
01:17:37,080 --> 01:17:41,240
know, it's basically trying to get you to extort money for some person so they want

879
01:17:41,240 --> 01:17:45,020
you to send their personal information instead of contact. It was the most elaborate email

880
01:17:45,020 --> 01:17:51,400
ever. I have it on my website but it was hilarious to read and they just wanted your personal

881
01:17:51,400 --> 01:17:52,400
information.

882
01:17:52,400 --> 01:17:57,400
Yeah, there's something I'm comfortable with. Sending out my personal information over the internet to somebody that I don't know.

883
01:17:57,400 --> 01:18:03,400
Oh yeah, fuck you to Japanese pornographers who put those fucking little mosaics over all the good stuff. I'm sick of that shit.

884
01:18:03,400 --> 01:18:05,400
That's actually a law.

885
01:18:05,400 --> 01:18:06,400
It's stupid.

886
01:18:06,400 --> 01:18:08,400
It's still a law, so they have to do it to sell their porn.

887
01:18:08,400 --> 01:18:11,400
That's stupid. I want to Seattle her naked.

888
01:18:11,400 --> 01:18:13,400
I can show you, um, Final Fuck X later.

889
01:18:13,400 --> 01:18:15,400
Hahahaha.

890
01:18:15,400 --> 01:18:18,400
Eishpika oishii.

891
01:18:18,400 --> 01:18:19,400
She has porn.

892
01:18:19,400 --> 01:18:22,560
Okay, my turn.

893
01:18:22,560 --> 01:18:26,160
Fuck you to alcohol for making me have to pee all the time.

894
01:18:26,160 --> 01:18:28,160
Alcohol is your friend.

895
01:18:28,160 --> 01:18:29,800
Fuck you again to the spammers.

896
01:18:29,800 --> 01:18:32,960
But see, I only have two active emails that I use.

897
01:18:32,960 --> 01:18:36,320
All the rest of my AOL names are blocked from the internet, but DarkSakura.com was left

898
01:18:36,320 --> 01:18:37,320
open.

899
01:18:37,320 --> 01:18:43,700
I actually do have the site, but anyway, DarkSakura at AOL.com is now blocked from everybody except

900
01:18:43,700 --> 01:18:45,000
for the chosen few.

901
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:47,120
Yes, the chosen few.

902
01:18:47,120 --> 01:18:51,120
Delete a few, and if you want to be among them, you can ask me, and I might say no.

903
01:18:51,120 --> 01:18:55,120
Um, and I'm not telling you my other one, hell no.

904
01:18:55,120 --> 01:19:01,320
Um, but uh, my other one has to do with this stupid dumbass who walked out behind my car

905
01:19:01,320 --> 01:19:02,320
today.

906
01:19:02,320 --> 01:19:03,320
I nearly ran him over, and you know what?

907
01:19:03,320 --> 01:19:08,320
I wish I had, because the world would have been better without him in the gene pool.

908
01:19:08,320 --> 01:19:13,880
Um, fuck you goes to...

909
01:19:13,880 --> 01:19:18,080
He's like the little kid's pee or log floating in the gene pool.

910
01:19:18,080 --> 01:19:22,880
Yes, he is the feces of the gene pool.

911
01:19:22,880 --> 01:19:28,360
My other fuck you of the week goes to my BeatMania 2DX controller.

912
01:19:28,360 --> 01:19:32,340
Now normally when you have sticky keys on your 2DX controller, it's either going to

913
01:19:32,340 --> 01:19:35,680
be your first or your seventh key, am I right?

914
01:19:35,680 --> 01:19:36,680
Typically.

915
01:19:36,680 --> 01:19:38,200
My sticky key is my fourth key!

916
01:19:38,200 --> 01:19:42,480
Yes, the top, middle, purple key, or blue, or whatever color it is.

917
01:19:42,480 --> 01:19:43,480
It sticks!

918
01:19:43,480 --> 01:19:49,340
Really makes it hard to try to pass our five because you have that one key. That's like the center key and

919
01:19:50,340 --> 01:19:55,100
and then I like come really close to passing a seven and then

920
01:19:56,020 --> 01:20:00,660
It's that sticky key ruined it which by the way also fuck you goes toward

01:21:56,020 --> 01:21:58,580
You realize that my fiance is a manager of GameStop

951
01:21:58,580 --> 01:22:03,580
Yes, but Gamestop is one of those places that's not quite retail.

952
01:22:03,580 --> 01:22:04,580
Oh.

953
01:22:04,580 --> 01:22:06,580
I say not quite retail because it's not like Walmart or Target.

954
01:22:06,580 --> 01:22:08,580
It's a little bit smaller so you can get away with a little bit more.

955
01:22:08,580 --> 01:22:11,580
But I'll give him an exception. Dan's a cool guy. Shout out to Dan.

956
01:22:11,580 --> 01:22:15,580
Okay, uh, T23M, Bonk Bonk is having dinner.

23rd Majest is having dinner or something. He's just too late, so he missed out.

958
01:22:19,580 --> 01:22:22,580
He says he'll have to fuck you in a little bit. He's finishing up dinner.

959

01:22:35,580 --> 01:22:37,580
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

01:22:37,580 --> 01:22:39,580
Oh god, I'm thinking Polyteria.

969
01:22:39,580 --> 01:22:41,580
It's the email. The email. What? The email.

970
01:22:41,580 --> 01:22:43,580
Give me some more alcohol.

971
01:22:43,580 --> 01:22:44,580
You want another Godiva?

972
01:22:44,580 --> 01:22:46,580
No. I want another Bacardi.

973
01:22:46,580 --> 01:22:48,580
Bacardi? Not Bacardi, but...

974
01:22:48,580 --> 01:22:49,580
Thingy.

975
01:22:49,580 --> 01:22:51,580
Um, okay.

976
01:22:51,580 --> 01:22:53,580
Fuck, um, the email box.

01:22:53,580 --> 01:22:55,580
So guess what? Fuck yous are over.

978
01:22:55,580 --> 01:23:02,580
Okay, um, now what do we do? We've got all the angst out of our system.

979
01:23:02,580 --> 01:23:07,260
Any suggestions? Damn, we have like an hour left, or an hour

980
01:23:07,260 --> 01:23:12,260
and a half left. Uh, uh, the words aren't on the screen!

981
01:23:12,260 --> 01:23:18,260
People, come back! You're being awfully quiet, you're tired.

982
01:23:18,260 --> 01:23:24,260
Would you like to say something enlightening to the chat room?

983
01:23:24,260 --> 01:23:28,260
I really, really, really, really hate Sherry's Berries.

984
01:23:28,260 --> 01:23:43,320
You heard it here on Orange

985
01:23:43,320 --> 01:23:44,320
I'll alert the media. Oh wait, we are the media.

986
01:23:44,320 --> 01:23:54,320
Well, that's like ice cream. It's Asian ice cream. Oh yeah.

987
01:23:54,320 --> 01:24:03,320
I think we should go to a break. Who agrees with me? Like, half of our people have already gone downstairs to watch the Ron Jeremy movie.

988
01:24:03,320 --> 01:24:08,560
There goes one of our hosts!

989
01:24:08,560 --> 01:24:13,800
We're going to an extended break, um, yeah, extended break.

990
01:24:13,800 --> 01:24:17,380
Some of us have to pee too, um, except I already went.

991
01:24:17,380 --> 01:24:18,380
You didn't need to know that.

992
01:24:18,380 --> 01:24:21,760
God, now I'm in here by myself, jeez!

993
01:24:21,760 --> 01:24:22,760
Okay.

01:24:22,760 --> 01:24:25,520

Order in this sector, Guardian Angel reflect the light. Lyrically, I owns the mic, you slept the devil take that...

1007
01:26:41,900 --> 01:26:47,900
Order in this sector, Guardian Angel reflect the light. Lyrically, I own the mic you slept the devil take that shit.

1008
01:26:47,900 --> 01:26:49,900
That you ejected, haunt you, a journey want to

1009
01:26:49,900 --> 01:26:51,900
Hang with the one you dissed before and slammed up presently

1010
01:26:51,900 --> 01:26:53,900
And quench ya, of some hallucination

1011
01:26:53,900 --> 01:26:55,900
Identify new stations where my vocals heard

1012
01:26:55,900 --> 01:26:58,900
Count the total verbs, be flippin' at the lower words

1013
01:26:58,900 --> 01:27:00,900
My destiny, set for day to leave, forget Maybelline

1014
01:27:00,900 --> 01:27:03,900
I got no maybes, running my shows in your nose without

1015
01:27:03,900 --> 01:27:05,900
Anti-histamine, I'm in the future

1016
01:27:05,900 --> 01:27:07,900
MCs who misdemean as left to be

1017
01:27:07,900 --> 01:27:09,900
History's a hoocha, think you spitting at

1018
01:27:09,900 --> 01:27:12,900
I represent a different map, hip-hop diplomat

1019
01:27:12,900 --> 01:27:13,900
I've heard you seen a tip with that

1020
01:27:13,900 --> 01:27:15,900
Be right, be ya, I'm original flowjack

1021
01:27:15,900 --> 01:27:17,780
No flow jack, God glorify it

1022
01:27:17,840 --> 01:27:20,240
Poor spiritual elitist frat remain anonymous

1023
01:27:20,300 --> 01:27:21,900
Maleficent, pick astronomer

1024
01:27:21,980 --> 01:27:24,240
Ear tight apparel, third commandment for idolatry

1025
01:27:24,300 --> 01:27:26,780
Cause tomorrow won't go so soon

1026
01:27:26,840 --> 01:27:29,440
I gotta get through to you

1027
01:27:29,500 --> 01:27:31,840
Cause tomorrow won't go so soon

1028
01:27:31,900 --> 01:27:34,140
I don't wanna make that move

1029
01:27:34,200 --> 01:27:37,300
Cause tomorrow won't go so soon

1030
01:27:37,380 --> 01:27:39,500
It's nothin' I got to do

1031
01:27:39,580 --> 01:27:42,300
Cause tomorrow won't go so soon

1032
01:27:42,380 --> 01:27:44,800
I gotta get through you

1033
01:27:44,800 --> 01:27:49,800
I've been wondering what's written into me

1034
01:27:49,800 --> 01:27:54,800
Those sweet words are hard to believe

1035
01:27:54,800 --> 01:27:59,800
Stop playing games and let me let you know

1036
01:27:59,800 --> 01:28:02,800
It ain't just what you show, but why you'd show this

1037
01:28:02,800 --> 01:28:04,800
This world will flow like there's no tomorrow

1038
01:28:04,800 --> 01:28:07,800
I constellate any track with verbiage I extract

1039
01:28:07,800 --> 01:28:09,800
Expect the less for max, we bomb the cats, we dump

1040
01:28:09,800 --> 01:28:10,800
We just feel this, I contract

1041
01:28:10,800 --> 01:28:12,800
I commit the act of subtraction, I whack one

1042
01:28:12,800 --> 01:28:15,360
Black one, even snatch crumbs are financially bad munch

1043
01:28:15,360 --> 01:28:17,360
You be messin' with the rare specimen

1044
01:28:17,360 --> 01:28:18,760
Whose vision is invagin'?

1045
01:28:18,760 --> 01:28:20,480
Just catch you wankin' the tangent off the track

1046
01:28:20,480 --> 01:28:21,440
Will I be ever changin'?

1047
01:28:21,440 --> 01:28:23,680
You wonder where all these thoughts come from

1048
01:28:23,680 --> 01:28:25,680
Verbal, the mind-toucher, I fell under you like

1049
01:28:25,680 --> 01:28:27,680
Python as a mama, like it was vomit

1050
01:28:27,680 --> 01:28:29,680
Pro-feasly, hard on the language, not excuse me

1051
01:28:29,680 --> 01:28:31,440
As an anthem, I'll archive it, choose thee

1052
01:28:31,440 --> 01:28:32,960
Left face, but wish to carry out

1053
01:28:32,960 --> 01:28:34,240
Whether by land or aerial

1054
01:28:34,240 --> 01:28:35,840
Cuz, this kid cannot be stereo

1055
01:28:35,840 --> 01:28:37,280
Talk out more brothers than burial

1056
01:28:37,280 --> 01:28:39,440
Right for harvest, you jacklin', not a novice

1057
01:28:39,440 --> 01:28:41,760
Caught as a hip-hop fan blowin' up A&C

1058
01:28:41,760 --> 01:28:46,760
I ain't your average artist, my thought is Look into God's direction and I can guard it, sis

1059
01:28:46,760 --> 01:28:51,760
We all look and see who's in reality

1060
01:28:51,760 --> 01:28:56,760
Believe and care will set you free, yeah

1061
01:28:56,760 --> 01:28:59,760
I need a change on your mind

1062
01:28:59,760 --> 01:29:01,760
Two parts and three divides

1063
01:29:01,760 --> 01:29:04,760
Do it, let's give it here

1064
01:29:04,760 --> 01:29:07,760
So I'll call you now

1065
01:29:07,760 --> 01:29:09,760
Tomorrow won't go to school

1066
01:29:09,760 --> 01:29:11,760
I gotta get through to you

1067
01:29:11,760 --> 01:29:14,760
Tomorrow won't go to school

1068
01:29:14,760 --> 01:29:16,760
I gotta make that move

1069
01:29:16,760 --> 01:29:19,760
Tomorrow won't go to school

1070
01:29:19,760 --> 01:29:21,760
It's not that I've got to do

1071
01:29:21,760 --> 01:29:24,760
Tomorrow won't go to school

1072
01:29:24,760 --> 01:29:27,760
I gotta get through you

1073
01:29:27,760 --> 01:29:29,760
And yo, you know how we do

1074
01:29:29,760 --> 01:29:32,760
It's D-A-E-D-R-D-A-B-A-L

1075
01:29:32,760 --> 01:29:34,760
No one represents the meteorites

1076
01:29:34,760 --> 01:29:36,760
No proof, know what I'm saying?

1077
01:29:36,760 --> 01:29:40,260
Yo, right around now DJ Hoori's in the mix

1078
01:29:40,260 --> 01:29:42,260
Keeping you in constant suspense

1079
01:29:42,260 --> 01:29:45,760
Yo, ni senju ni nen no soundo sakura

1080
01:29:45,760 --> 01:29:46,760
You know what I'm saying?

1081
01:29:46,760 --> 01:29:49,800
Yo, and it goes a little something like this y'all

1082
01:31:16,760 --> 01:31:32,760
Kowashite mia oshite waka akeru no ni

1083
01:31:32,760 --> 01:31:38,260
Sole ga asashi no go ikakurakara

1084
01:32:08,260 --> 01:32:10,260
Oh

01:33:08,260 --> 01:33:15,260
I'll never forget you

1086
01:33:15,260 --> 01:33:21,260
I'll never forget you

1087
01:33:21,260 --> 01:33:32,260
I'll never forget you

1088
01:33:32,260 --> 01:33:37,900
Yeah, she's the last one

1089
01:34:02,260 --> 01:34:04,260
You

1090
01:35:32,260 --> 01:35:33,260
You don't need another one

1091
01:35:33,260 --> 01:35:43,460
You don't need another one

1092
01:35:43,460 --> 01:35:43,960
Yes!

1093
01:36:13,460 --> 01:36:15,460
Oh

1094
01:36:43,460 --> 01:36:48,460
And there's another you and I hell

1095
01:36:48,460 --> 01:36:52,460
Here comes another one

1096
01:36:52,460 --> 01:36:56,460
You've got to get another one

1097
01:37:26,460 --> 01:37:38,800
We're back live. That was a series of long versions. The first one that we had was M-Flow

1098
01:37:38,800 --> 01:37:44,440
with Flowjack, Mr. Junk Remix. Next was Judy and Mary with Sobekasu, which, yeah, the English

1099
01:37:44,440 --> 01:37:49,460
version was in DDR. And then Gacked with Another World, a song that made it into Guitar Freaks

1100
01:37:49,460 --> 01:37:51,460
I'M ON JACK'S PARTY!

1101
01:38:19,460 --> 01:38:24,600
stated the fact that everybody in the porn industry has a case of herpes, and, you know,

1102
01:38:24,600 --> 01:38:28,300
you may be looking at Jenna Jameson or Asia Carrera at home, but you have to consider

1103
01:38:28,300 --> 01:38:31,580
the fact that they might have, like, more diseases than Anna Nicole Smith has lawsuits

1104
01:38:31,580 --> 01:38:35,060
over that old guy, so it's kind of scary.

1105
01:38:35,060 --> 01:38:39,300
Actually, Ron, Jeremy said that he's only come down with, what was it, the crabs and

1106
01:38:39,300 --> 01:38:43,060
something else one time, but that was before he got in the industry. He's been 21 years

1107
01:38:43,060 --> 01:38:44,700
in the industry and he's been clean the whole time.

1108
01:38:44,700 --> 01:38:49,340
Wow, he must have been getting some decent chicks in. I mean, I'd be sca- I mean, you

1109
01:38:49,340 --> 01:38:52,900
know, you think about it, like, you hear about, like, gangbangs and stuff, uh, who's the last-

1110
01:38:52,900 --> 01:38:57,300
Jasmine St. Clair and there was some other chick, Houston, I think her name was? They

1111
01:38:57,300 --> 01:39:02,500
go through, like, 500 guys! That's scary! You'd have to back a rider truck into that

1112
01:39:02,500 --> 01:39:10,500
to catch a feeling. That's, like, ugh! Yeah, the world record gangbang things. That's

1113
01:39:10,500 --> 01:39:13,160
crazy

1114
01:39:13,160 --> 01:39:14,900
something fun

1115
01:39:14,900 --> 01:39:18,420
do you catch feelings in that and you have like walk back and forth between

1116
01:39:18,420 --> 01:39:20,280
the walls already catch anything

1117
01:39:20,280 --> 01:39:23,420
and let's not get twisted if a girl goes out sleeps with a bunch of guys that

1118
01:39:23,420 --> 01:39:26,380
does not necessarily makers like you know uh...

1119
01:39:26,380 --> 01:39:29,680
i'm not i'm not at all for the double standard

1120
01:39:29,680 --> 01:39:33,000
you know guys go out to the bunch of women and they're considered studs for

1121
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:34,220
it or that it's ok

1122
01:39:34,220 --> 01:39:37,460
goes on to the budget doesn't consider slots that stupid if you don't have a

1123
01:39:37,460 --> 01:39:39,700
protected sex with a bunch of guys

1124
01:39:39,700 --> 01:39:42,640
that's one thing but if you're going out and you're being healthy about it i mean hey that's

1125
01:39:42,640 --> 01:39:45,620
that's your decision and you know

1126
01:39:45,620 --> 01:39:51,820
exactly it doesn't make you a slut makes you horny

1127
01:39:51,820 --> 01:39:55,460
we need more of that we need more women who are open about that sort of thing to

1128
01:39:55,460 --> 01:39:58,900
actually get out there and talk to guys and you know completely shatter that

1129
01:39:58,900 --> 01:40:00,360
whole stereotype

1130
01:40:00,360 --> 01:40:02,980
because i think it would make things a lot easier on guys plus you'd let them

1131
01:40:02,980 --> 01:40:06,800
know if they were in the friend zone a lot easier and that would help

1132
01:40:06,800 --> 01:40:12,160
nothing's hotter than a woman coming out here

1133
01:40:12,160 --> 01:40:15,000
i'm convinced that we're going to get any guys they want to if they just came

1134
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:18,600
on the more guys but what is released all of the time while uh...

1135
01:40:18,600 --> 01:40:22,180
dark soccer comes up with something she's right now a few things right now

1241
01:49:35,320 --> 01:49:40,320
Ron Jeremy was his hero because he could buff his own pickle

1242
01:49:40,320 --> 01:49:45,320
Actor came out of the mouth of the woman that he was having sex with because his penis was so big

01:49:45,320 --> 01:49:50,320
I'm boring, I said it because he could suck it

1252
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:23,880
yeah at least he died happy

1253
01:50:23,880 --> 01:50:27,400
and eight days a week they had a guy that uh... sprained his neck doing that

1254
01:50:27,400 --> 01:50:37,960

1255
01:50:37,960 --> 01:50:42,400

01:51:51,280 --> 01:51:55,280
Naoki, give us your answer!

1259
01:51:55,280 --> 01:52:15,880
...

1260
01:52:15,880 --> 01:52:17,380
Actually, you know what I just noticed?

1261
01:52:18,980 --> 01:52:21,080
Evilenaki2DX has left our chat room.

1262
01:52:21,780 --> 01:52:22,780
I just noticed.

1263
01:52:22,780 --> 01:52:27,820
Are we going to be able to find another contestant in the interim?

1264
01:52:28,200 --> 01:52:31,040
Who wants to take Naoki's place, or should we wait?

1265
01:52:31,360 --> 01:52:32,160
I don't know, chat room.

1266
01:52:32,740 --> 01:52:33,960
Guys, should we wait for Naoki?

1267
01:52:34,420 --> 01:52:36,340
Can we give him a few minutes?

1268
01:52:36,340 --> 01:52:40,640
We'll go ahead and take another break.

1269
01:52:40,640 --> 01:52:45,720
We'll give him a few minutes to show up, and if he doesn't show

1270
01:52:45,720 --> 01:52:49,120
up then we'll have to find a replacement.

1271
01:52:49,120 --> 01:52:53,680
I'm probably in the interest of fairness we'll have to go ahead and set this

1272
01:52:53,680 --> 01:52:59,800
point aside so we'll go ahead and play a song or two just to give us some time.

1273
01:52:59,800 --> 01:53:07,360
That's fair, right? One song. We'll go ahead and pick a song so I'll play a...

1274
01:53:07,360 --> 01:53:13,920
You know what? Just to put this in the interest of nice, pornorific music, let me go

1275
01:53:13,920 --> 01:53:27,040
into my ddr directory here and we will play god as soon as i can find it i can't find

01:53:27,040 --> 01:53:33,940

01:54:33,940 --> 01:55:00,380
Okay, Naoki's not back.

1280
01:55:00,380 --> 01:55:05,500
So we're going to go ahead and pick the next person in the chat room.

1281
01:55:05,500 --> 01:55:08,820
We'll put it to a vote, okay?

1282
01:55:08,820 --> 01:55:11,500

1300
01:56:38,060 --> 01:56:55,720
played DVR while naked. My answer, it was Ruben, Ruben who said the big black cock.

1301
01:56:55,720 --> 01:57:00,960
My answer was, Linda the less she said to play DVR while watching Rod Jeremy give himself

1302
01:57:00,960 --> 01:57:07,660
head. What was your answer? She was playing DVR while masturbating. Not

01:59:00,760 --> 01:59:04,480
so we'll go ahead and repeat the question, or whatever.

1310
01:59:04,480 --> 01:59:08,720
Perry the Perfect Attacker wanted to enter the Perfect Attack Tournament because he didn't.

1311
01:59:08,720 --> 01:59:09,720
Blank.

1312
01:59:09,720 --> 01:59:12,720
Um, we'll go ahead to EOSFB.

1313
01:59:13,720 --> 01:59:16,720
His penis wasn't as big as Ron Jeremy's.

1314
01:59:17,720 --> 01:59:19,720
What does that have to do with PA? We'll never know.

1315
01:59:19,720 --> 01:59:21,720
Stop talking about Ron Jeremy, man!

1316
01:59:22,720 --> 01:59:25,720
Dirk Tetsi says, because he was watching porn.

1317
01:59:26,720 --> 01:59:27,720
Okay.

1318
01:59:28,720 --> 01:59:30,720
My answer. My answer.

1319
01:59:31,720 --> 01:59:34,720
Because Tigger already entered it, and he would have won anyway.

1320
01:59:34,720 --> 01:59:41,720
because it doesn't matter because if tinker enters you're gonna lose so go home and sleep

1321
01:59:41,720 --> 01:59:45,080
yeah

1322
01:59:45,080 --> 01:59:52,720
i said because he was too busy fapping to anna or hora prawn she has a really nice ass

1323
01:59:52,720 --> 01:59:57,080
i said because what did i say because he was watching ron jeremy give himself head

1324
01:59:57,080 --> 02:00:02,360
both of those involve watching porn right

1325
02:00:02,360 --> 02:00:10,360
He gets a half point for each of those, so yeah, D'artecia is ahead by one point.

1326
02:00:14,360 --> 02:00:17,360
Okay, next question.

1327
02:00:18,360 --> 02:00:23,360
For his birthday, Loki asks for a bowl of ice cream and blank.

1328
02:00:23,360 --> 02:00:30,360
For his birthday, Loki asked for a bowl of ice cream and blank.

1329
02:01:23,360 --> 02:01:32,360
Okay, we have answers. So let's go ahead and go to our contestants. Okay? Back to the question.

1330
02:01:32,360 --> 02:01:36,360
PerryThePerfectAttacker wants to enter...no, that's the wrong one. My bad.

1331
02:01:36,360 --> 02:01:39,360
ForestBorthdayLoki asked for a bowl of ice cream and blank.

1332
02:01:39,360 --> 02:01:43,360
EOSFB said, Run Jeremy Porn!

1333
02:01:43,360 --> 02:01:46,360
Stop saying that!

1334
02:01:46,360 --> 02:01:51,360
Fucking A! Stop talking about Run Jeremy! It sure isn't about him!

1335
02:01:51,360 --> 02:01:56,360
Um, Dark Testia says, Asian Midget Porn!

1336
02:01:56,360 --> 02:01:59,360
The fuck would I want? Asian Midget Porn!

1337
02:01:59,360 --> 02:02:02,360
They actually have Asian midgets? That's what I want to know, man.

1338
02:02:02,360 --> 02:02:05,360
How tall do they stand?

1339
02:02:05,360 --> 02:02:07,360
Two feet three.

1340
02:02:07,360 --> 02:02:10,360
Okay.

1341
02:02:10,360 --> 02:02:15,360
For his birthday, Loki asked for a bowl of ice cream and a license to kill idiots.

1342
02:02:15,360 --> 02:02:18,360
That's a close second.

1343
02:02:18,360 --> 02:02:30,360
Mine was, okay, a giant harem full of young Asian schoolgirls, naked and horny, with whipped cream, lots of whipped cream.

1344
02:02:30,360 --> 02:02:40,360
Actually, you know, now that I meant, yeah, Asian schoolgirls naked. And, cause I can't, you know, obviously I'm seeing someone, but you know, it's a gift, and it'd be wrong for me to refuse a gift.

1345
02:02:40,360 --> 02:02:41,360
He's a gift.

1346
02:02:41,360 --> 02:02:47,320
Man, if you don't need all those schoolgirls, donate to the fucking Chinese schoolgirls

1347
02:02:47,320 --> 02:02:48,960
fund for real.

1348
02:02:48,960 --> 02:02:51,740
But I was gonna say a sweet transvestite from Transylvania...

1349
02:02:51,740 --> 02:02:53,400
BROTHER DICKIN' EATS!

1350
02:02:53,400 --> 02:02:55,400
But uh, anyway.

1351
02:02:55,400 --> 02:02:58,640
No, not Rob.

1352
02:02:58,640 --> 02:03:01,080
We never know.

1353
02:03:01,080 --> 02:03:04,200
My answer was increased breast-fies from those spammers.

1354
02:03:04,200 --> 02:03:08,360
And increased penis-size!

1355
02:03:08,360 --> 02:03:11,520
I'm sorry, we don't have a match.

1356
02:03:11,520 --> 02:03:15,180
No match for you!

1357
02:03:15,180 --> 02:03:16,340
Yeah.

1358
02:03:16,340 --> 02:03:17,800
You are a loser.

1359
02:03:17,800 --> 02:03:20,720
Okay, last question.

1360
02:03:20,720 --> 02:03:27,560
After playing seven games of DDR, Darla the Dancer decided to go rest by blank.

1361
02:03:27,560 --> 02:03:31,000
Send in your answer.

1362
02:03:31,000 --> 02:03:33,300
Throttle of his hands are decided to rest by a blank.

1363
02:04:01,000 --> 02:04:30,520
Alright, we're back!

1364
02:04:31,000 --> 02:04:37,500
Okay, after seven games of DDR, Darla the Dancer decided to go rest by blank.

1365
02:04:37,500 --> 02:04:43,000
EOSFB said, rest by a cherry tree- er, I mean, Ron Jeremy's penis.

1366
02:04:43,000 --> 02:04:48,000
Uh, Dark Tetsuya said, masturbating with a bottle of Propel.

1367
02:04:48,000 --> 02:04:50,000
What the fuck?

1368
02:04:50,000 --> 02:04:54,000
How the hell do you masturbate with a bottle of Propel?

1369
02:04:54,000 --> 02:04:56,000
Here, maybe Joe can explain this to you.

1370
02:04:56,000 --> 02:05:00,000
How in the hell do you masturbate with a bottle of Propel?

1371
02:05:00,000 --> 02:05:05,000
Can you answer this from experience? Mind telling us about it?

1372
02:05:05,000 --> 02:05:12,000
Now, bottle of balls, that's different because it's kind of, you know, ribbed on the outside, so I assume that women might like that, you know.

1373
02:05:12,000 --> 02:05:14,000
You sound like you say this from experience.

1374
02:05:14,000 --> 02:05:22,000
That's a little bit disturbing, but you could probably fit it inside of like, you know, like Anna Nicole Smith's vagina, I guess, maybe.

1375
02:05:22,000 --> 02:05:24,000
Don't get me started on the stories I've heard before.

1376
02:05:24,000 --> 02:05:26,000
Such as?

1377
02:05:26,000 --> 02:05:28,000
My mom's a nurse, I've heard stories.

1378
02:05:28,000 --> 02:05:31,200
okay we're story

1379
02:05:31,200 --> 02:05:32,400
yeah i'll save it

1380
02:05:32,400 --> 02:05:34,680
okay she's gonna save them i want to hear this

1381
02:05:34,680 --> 02:05:37,640
what's in their vagina

1382
02:05:37,640 --> 02:05:41,960
okay we'll save that for right after the match game how does that is that fair

1383
02:05:41,960 --> 02:05:45,160
my answer was

1384
02:05:45,160 --> 02:05:51,440
after playing seven games of ddr darla the dancer decided to go rest by

1385
02:05:51,440 --> 02:05:53,280
just propel

1386
02:05:53,280 --> 02:05:54,880
your answer

1387
02:05:54,880 --> 02:06:00,300
Well, rest by? Are you talking about like an actual physical object that she's resting by?

1388
02:06:00,300 --> 02:06:02,020
Just propel.

1389
02:06:02,020 --> 02:06:02,860
Okay, well anyways,

1390
02:06:02,860 --> 02:06:09,260
I was gonna say, uh, Darla the Dancer decided to go rest by watching Ron Jeremy suck his own penis.

1391
02:06:09,260 --> 02:06:12,660
Since obviously that was every fucking other answer!

1392
02:06:12,660 --> 02:06:16,860
Ugh.

1393
02:06:16,860 --> 02:06:19,380
Uh, Darla went to go rest, um,

1394
02:06:19,380 --> 02:06:23,460
by watching one of my ninja school girls practice because I have ninja school

1395
02:06:23,460 --> 02:06:26,560
girls and they are kick-ass

1396
02:06:26,560 --> 02:06:33,560
I decided she was going to rest by blowing up Roseville Golf Land

1397
02:06:34,080 --> 02:06:38,160
I want this movie that has ninja school girls. Ninja school girls are cool

1398
02:06:38,160 --> 02:06:41,520
Dude, blowing up Roseville Golf Land sounds like my idea of restful

1399
02:06:41,520 --> 02:06:42,820
That actually sounds exciting

1400
02:06:42,820 --> 02:06:46,640
Okay, so Dark Tetsuya gets half a point, EOSFP gets half a point

1401
02:06:46,640 --> 02:06:47,660
Which means that

1402
02:06:47,660 --> 02:06:54,660
Dartis is our winner! Yay!

1403
02:06:55,280 --> 02:06:57,820
You win a bloody anus!

1404
02:06:57,820 --> 02:07:01,180
Here on Orange Loves Radio!

1405
02:07:01,180 --> 02:07:03,920
Um, so, Melody, you wanna tell us about the

1406
02:07:03,920 --> 02:07:09,140
about the segment, what stuck up the vagina?

1407
02:07:09,140 --> 02:07:12,860
It, it actually wouldn't be a vagina unless spammers have actually come up with, um,

1408
02:07:12,860 --> 02:07:14,700
how to grow a new vagina

1409
02:07:14,700 --> 02:07:16,780
instead of, like, increased breast size.

1410
02:07:16,780 --> 02:07:20,580
Now, my mom told me once she heard a story from an x-ray tech

1411
02:07:20,580 --> 02:07:23,300
where this guy was complaining that, um,

1412
02:07:23,300 --> 02:07:26,300
I don't remember what his complaint was, but they needed to do x-rays.

1413
02:07:26,300 --> 02:07:27,740
So, um,

1414
02:07:27,740 --> 02:07:28,580
x-ray tech

1415
02:07:28,580 --> 02:07:31,700
took him into the x-ray room and positioned him and everything, and

1416
02:07:31,700 --> 02:07:34,940
she turns out the light, because you have to turn out the light to take an x-ray, well, there was

1417
02:07:34,940 --> 02:07:37,740
still light in the room.

1418
02:07:37,740 --> 02:07:40,820
She can't figure it out until she realized the light was coming from the

1419
02:07:40,820 --> 02:07:43,100
guy's ass.

1420
02:07:43,100 --> 02:07:50,100
because he had inserted a flashlight and it had turned itself on.

1421
02:07:50,980 --> 02:07:55,400
I can understand if you know you're a little bit kinky and

1422
02:07:55,400 --> 02:08:00,740
you know, there's nothing wrong with anal sex, that's your thing, you know, go ahead and do it as long as you're careful.

1423
02:08:00,740 --> 02:08:03,760
But there are just some things that shouldn't go in your ass and I'm pretty sure

1424
02:08:03,760 --> 02:08:05,860
flashlights, cell phones are one,

1425
02:08:05,860 --> 02:08:11,680
but I'm pretty sure flashlights are up there in the top five. Barbie dolls or others, hamsters, no.

1426
02:08:11,680 --> 02:08:16,680
You know, but th- th- th- th- no, okay? Just- just flashlights, don't play that game.

1427
02:08:18,480 --> 02:08:21,380
And Dami's doing something on the computer, I'm trying to hand her back the mic.

1428
02:08:21,380 --> 02:08:23,780
You're watching- you're listening to Orange Lounge right now.

1429
02:08:24,380 --> 02:08:27,280
Um, we're talking about things that are stuck in people's asses.

1430
02:08:27,280 --> 02:08:32,680
I actually heard a story at San Francisco General Hospital about a guy who came in

1431
02:08:33,580 --> 02:08:36,080
and supposedly had shoved a cucumber into his rectum.

1432
02:08:36,280 --> 02:08:39,280
When asked by the doctors how it got there, he said he fell on it.

1433
02:08:39,280 --> 02:08:45,280
I'm no rocket scientist or anything, but you don't just fall on a cucumber, you know?

1434
02:08:45,280 --> 02:08:46,280
Wait, hang on, Melly.

1435
02:08:46,280 --> 02:08:50,280
My question is, why are you naked and falling on a cucumber in the first place?

1436
02:08:50,280 --> 02:08:57,280
I do that every day, you know, I go home at random and I just grease up a Crisco, a cucumber with Crisco.

1437
02:08:57,280 --> 02:09:04,280
I just fall on that motherfucker because I feel like it fucking Johnny Knox would want to be a motherfucker.

1438
02:09:04,280 --> 02:09:07,280
I think we should introduce a new segment on the show, by the way.

1439
02:09:07,280 --> 02:09:13,120
The Darwin Awards Segment I'm going to read some information off of

1440
02:09:13,120 --> 02:09:15,200
the Darwin Awards News Stories

1441
02:09:15,200 --> 02:09:25,480
We're going to read one called Midnight Snack 23rd October 2002 Australia

1442
02:09:25,480 --> 02:09:28,520
What besides beer is Australia's most recognizable symbol?

1443
02:09:28,520 --> 02:09:32,520
Saltwater crocodiles, of course, popularized by crocodile hunter Steve Irwin

1444
02:09:32,520 --> 02:09:35,520
What is the most natural tourist activity?

1445
02:09:35,520 --> 02:09:38,500
Try viewing these amazing beauties in their natural habitat.

1446
02:09:38,500 --> 02:09:43,780
Tours from around the world visit the wild places of Australia, so open water is routinely

1447
02:09:43,780 --> 02:09:47,920
posted with graphic warning signs to let people know that swimming with these dinosaur-like

1448
02:09:47,920 --> 02:09:49,820
carnivores is not a good idea.

1449
02:09:49,820 --> 02:09:53,300
The sign typically shows a human figure between the jaws of a salty.

1450
02:09:53,300 --> 02:09:57,540
The blunt graphic has proven so effective enough that there have been no crocodile-related

1451
02:09:57,540 --> 02:10:01,820
deaths in the Northern Territory since 1998, at least not until now.

1452
02:10:01,820 --> 02:10:05,820
Perhaps it was the full moon, or the warmth of the evening, that convinced a young German

1453
02:10:05,820 --> 02:10:07,780
woman to go for a midnight swim.

1454
02:10:07,780 --> 02:10:11,860
As usual, the billabong was clearly posted with toothy danger signs.

1455
02:10:11,860 --> 02:10:15,060
The woman, a short-lived member of an adventure tour group, was about to get more adventure

1456
02:10:15,060 --> 02:10:17,220
than is generally advertised.

1457
02:10:17,220 --> 02:10:20,940
Police commander Max Pope stated, the warm night, the full moon, the billabong looked

1458
02:10:20,940 --> 02:10:21,940
idyllic.

1459
02:10:21,940 --> 02:10:24,940
But danger, in the form of a twelve-foot seltie, lurched beneath the tranquility.

1460
02:10:24,940 --> 02:10:28,000
The next morning, the crocodile was located, still holding the deceased.

1461
02:10:28,000 --> 02:10:29,500
It was harpooned by wildlife officers.

1462
02:10:29,500 --> 02:10:35,500
For both Woman and Crocodile, the idyllic days of summer ended with a midnight snack.

1463
02:10:35,500 --> 02:10:38,500
How's that for stupid?

1464
02:10:38,500 --> 02:10:43,500
That's not that bad. I mean, I've seen... I've heard worse.

1465
02:10:43,500 --> 02:10:47,500
There was a funny one about some guy that, like, fell over a cliff, or the...

1466
02:10:47,500 --> 02:10:50,500
Something about, like, um...

1467
02:10:50,500 --> 02:10:58,500
I don't know, it had to do with some guy in a tree or something, and then there was a truck on a cliff or something, and they backed it up and ran over the guy in the tree, and...

1468
02:10:58,500 --> 02:11:03,500
I got a Darwin award. Puff Daddy thought he could come up with something fucking original. There's your Darwin.

1469
02:11:03,500 --> 02:11:05,500
Here's another one.

1470
02:11:05,500 --> 02:11:07,500
November 2002, The Netherlands.

1471
02:11:07,500 --> 02:11:11,500
A retired engineer booby-trapped his home with the intention of killing his estranged family,

1472
02:11:11,500 --> 02:11:14,500
but died himself after inadvertently triggering one of his own devices.

1473
02:11:14,500 --> 02:11:20,500
At first, police assumed the 79-year-old had committed suicide, as he was found alone with a bullet wound in the neck.

1474
02:11:20,500 --> 02:11:25,500
Then, a detective missed a bullet by inches when he opened a booby-trapped wooden chest.

1475
02:11:25,500 --> 02:11:28,660
This beat a hasty retreat from the property and called in military experts.

1476
02:11:28,660 --> 02:11:33,340
They deciphered an enigmatic series of scribbled clues to locate nineteen death traps in walls,

1477
02:11:33,340 --> 02:11:35,060
ceilings, and household objects.

1478
02:11:35,060 --> 02:11:40,220
A pile of booby-trap dinner plates was revealed by the clue, cheaper by the dozen, a reference

1479
02:11:40,220 --> 02:11:43,060
to a film in which a child throws a plate at someone's head.

1480
02:11:43,060 --> 02:11:46,900
Please speculate that the notes were intended to assist his failing memory.

1481
02:11:46,900 --> 02:11:51,740
Other traps included numerous concealed shotguns triggered by threads, and an exploding crate

1482
02:11:51,740 --> 02:11:56,220
beer set to detonate once a certain number of bottles were removed.

1483
02:11:56,220 --> 02:11:59,180
It took three weeks to crack nineteen of the twenty clues, and

1484
02:11:59,180 --> 02:12:01,580
the experts were forced to admit defeat on the final note.

1485
02:12:01,580 --> 02:12:04,700
The twelve apostles are ready to work on the pebbles," said one.

1486
02:12:04,700 --> 02:12:06,900
We have never come across anything like it before.

1487
02:12:06,900 --> 02:12:08,220
It was all fiendishly clever.

1488
02:12:08,220 --> 02:12:11,660
True to form, the fiendishly clever but careless Darwin award winner was

1489
02:12:11,660 --> 02:12:15,260
described by neighbors as a tactically harmless man who employed puttering

1490
02:12:15,260 --> 02:12:16,260
in his garage.

1491
02:12:16,260 --> 02:12:18,540
But relatives say he never forgave his wife for

1492
02:12:18,540 --> 02:12:20,980
deforcing him twenty years before.

1493
02:12:20,980 --> 02:12:24,200
Police believe he began installing the traps for four years after losing a lengthy battle

1494
02:12:24,200 --> 02:12:25,820
to keep his home.

1495
02:12:25,820 --> 02:12:30,980
Although some may argue that fourteen children in his advanced age rule out of Darwin award,

1496
02:12:30,980 --> 02:12:35,880
the judges feel the magnitude of his actions overcome by these practical concerns.

1497
02:12:35,880 --> 02:12:37,660
That one was cool.

1498
02:12:37,660 --> 02:12:45,620
Booby trapping your home with twenty traps intended to kill your family.

1499
02:12:45,620 --> 02:12:47,500
The cord was stuck.

1500
02:12:47,500 --> 02:12:53,680
It's not quite along that line, but I have an actual true-to-life, my own family story.

1501
02:12:53,680 --> 02:12:59,380
My great-uncle was in World War I or II, I can't remember which, I don't think I ever

1502
02:12:59,380 --> 02:13:04,320
really knew, and he lives in the Midwest in Missouri, and he passed away recently, and

1503
02:13:04,320 --> 02:13:07,460
my aunt and uncle moved into his house, and they were going through some of his stuff

1504
02:13:07,460 --> 02:13:12,940
in his basement and found a bunch of his World War I Rema Rebelia, and they found a hand

1505
02:13:12,940 --> 02:13:13,940
grenade.

1506
02:13:13,940 --> 02:13:18,260
Now, they're like, okay, this is interesting, so they call the St. Justice Police, who have

1507
02:13:18,260 --> 02:13:19,700
no bomb squad, because

1508
02:13:19,700 --> 02:13:23,100
it's not a small town, but it's not exactly huge, so they have to call Kansas City.

1509
02:13:23,100 --> 02:13:26,700
Well, Kansas City, of course, has bomb squads, but they can't really do anything about it,

1510
02:13:26,700 --> 02:13:27,660
because it's a good

1511
02:13:27,660 --> 02:13:30,620
hour's drive away. So,

1512
02:13:30,620 --> 02:13:35,540
Kansas City says, okay, call Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, for help.

1513
02:13:35,540 --> 02:13:38,580
They call Fort Leavenworth. The first thing

1514
02:13:38,580 --> 02:13:41,980
that Fort Leavenworth says is, okay, well, where is the hand grenade?

1515
02:13:41,980 --> 02:13:45,140
and they're like it's right next to us

1516
02:13:45,140 --> 02:13:48,620
the first thing they say is get out of the house this

1517
02:13:48,620 --> 02:13:52,420
instant don't hang up the phone and leave because apparently

1518
02:13:52,420 --> 02:13:56,100
these grenades when they're this old have a tendency to go off

1519
02:13:56,100 --> 02:13:59,900
on their own just from being handled my uncle was tossing the damn thing in the

1520
02:13:59,900 --> 02:14:00,980
air at the time

1521
02:14:00,980 --> 02:14:04,100
he was like freaking juggling the hand grenade

1522
02:14:04,100 --> 02:14:07,220
Fort Leavenworth drove out to my uncle's

1523
02:14:07,220 --> 02:14:10,740
old house, got the grenade, put it in a brom proof box

1524
02:14:10,740 --> 02:14:17,740
Duct tape that blocks to all freakin' hell and had to take it back to the base to be exploded.

1525
02:14:17,740 --> 02:14:22,740
Because remember folks, duct tape prevents explosions.

1526
02:14:22,740 --> 02:14:26,740
And apparently it's good for acne or something. I don't know.

1527
02:14:26,740 --> 02:14:29,740
It's stupid as all hell.

1528
02:14:29,740 --> 02:14:33,740
And my uncle is stupid as all hell because yeah, he's just in here doo-doo-doo-doo.

1529
02:14:33,740 --> 02:14:38,740
Here's the ingrenade to think I'll toss it in the air.

1530
02:14:38,740 --> 02:14:44,580
I think on that note we need to go to a break in this break for the sake of

1531
02:14:44,940 --> 02:14:48,400
Gumby who is in our chat room and hopefully listening to the show

1532
02:14:50,060 --> 02:14:53,180
We are going to play a song just for you

1533
02:14:54,660 --> 02:14:58,260
We are going to play bumblebee skies voice remix

1534
02:14:59,980 --> 02:15:04,580
And we are going to play some random other stuff maybe

1535
02:15:04,580 --> 02:15:11,780
a quick master from pop and music and some other random stuff this is from one

1536
02:15:11,780 --> 02:15:20,120
of this is from one of Rob's of fuck-off shows so here goes okay I guess we're

1537
02:15:20,120 --> 02:15:23,800
gonna do one more because I got these much better parody lyrics for bumblebee

1538
02:15:23,800 --> 02:15:27,720
than that shit I did a little bit ago so we're gonna do this one instead this

1539
02:15:27,720 --> 02:15:34,720
comes from DVR Angel and Stressa. This is much better, so enjoy.

1540
02:15:57,720 --> 02:15:58,720
Fantasy

1541
02:16:03,720 --> 02:16:06,720
My foot kicks your ass when you walk in the room

1542
02:16:06,720 --> 02:16:09,720
I go boom, boom, boom, you go zoom, zoom, zoom

1543
02:16:09,720 --> 02:16:13,720
You're my poor, mad, dead, bad, killable friend

1544
02:16:13,720 --> 02:16:17,720
I wanna kick your ass until you're dead

1545
02:16:17,720 --> 02:16:20,720
I'll shove my foot right up your ass

1546
02:16:20,720 --> 02:16:24,720
To help you see it's true

1547
02:16:24,720 --> 02:16:27,720
I don't like you, can't you see?

1548
02:16:27,720 --> 02:16:30,720
Now get the fuck away from me!

1549
02:16:31,720 --> 02:16:34,720
Sweet little Bumblebee, get the fuck away from me!

1550
02:16:34,720 --> 02:16:41,720
Sweet little bumblebee, just a funky panache

1551
02:16:41,720 --> 02:16:59,720
Sweet little bumblebee, just a funky panache

1552
02:16:59,720 --> 02:17:01,720
Fuck you.

1553
02:17:29,720 --> 02:17:31,720
Oh

1554
02:18:29,720 --> 02:18:35,720
This is the end of the video, if you want to see more videos like this, please subscribe to my channel.

1555
02:21:35,720 --> 02:21:52,040
See you in the later part!

1556
02:21:52,040 --> 02:21:56,440
This just sounds This just sounds

1557
02:21:56,440 --> 02:22:16,080
This is the way we dance, this is the way we rock, this is the way we vibe, as we demonstrate,

1558
02:22:16,080 --> 02:22:17,780
As we demonstrate

1559
02:22:17,780 --> 02:22:19,680
Everybody wants a piece of the pie

1560
02:22:19,680 --> 02:22:21,180
Bose, Amina, Mr. I

1561
02:22:21,180 --> 02:22:22,980
Cause the rules are like having the idol in the fight

1562
02:22:22,980 --> 02:22:24,980
Cause I spy, he makes fly

1563
02:22:24,980 --> 02:22:26,380
This is the way we dance

1564
02:22:26,380 --> 02:22:27,680
This is the way we rock

1565
02:22:27,680 --> 02:22:29,080
This is the way we ride

1566
02:22:29,080 --> 02:22:30,380
As we demonstrate

1567
02:22:30,380 --> 02:22:32,380
I'll show you them a straight

1568
02:22:49,180 --> 02:22:51,180
This just sounds

1569
02:22:51,820 --> 02:22:53,820
This just sounds

1570
02:22:53,820 --> 02:22:55,580
Everybody wants a piece of you in the pie

1571
02:22:55,580 --> 02:22:57,180
Paws on me like Mr. I

1572
02:22:57,180 --> 02:22:59,180
Paws on me like I'm the guy doing the fight

1573
02:23:29,180 --> 02:23:39,180
I'm sorry, that was dead air. My apologies. We're live again. Hey, let's do a quick promo.

1574
02:23:39,180 --> 02:23:49,380
Listen to Orange Lounge Radio. Yay! Yay! Okay. Damn, we got 30 more minutes to go. Let's

1575
02:23:49,380 --> 02:23:56,140
go back to our favorite segment. Ask Orange Lounge. Because we can't think of other shit

1576
02:23:56,140 --> 02:23:57,140
to do.

1577
02:23:57,140 --> 02:23:58,140
Yay!

1578
02:23:58,140 --> 02:24:04,700
I have real audio, but I can't find anything without hurting the stream.

1579
02:24:04,700 --> 02:24:05,700
Sorry.

1580
02:24:05,700 --> 02:24:09,020
Everyone, send us questions.

1581
02:24:09,020 --> 02:24:12,260
We'll send you answers.

1582
02:24:12,260 --> 02:24:17,700
In the interim, I'll go ahead, I used a big word, I wonder if they can understand that.

1583
02:24:17,700 --> 02:24:18,700
No.

1584
02:24:18,700 --> 02:24:21,740
Well, I have some, but not like I can play them on here.

1585
02:24:21,740 --> 02:24:25,220
Once we get about four questions up, then I'll go ahead and come back.

1586
02:24:25,220 --> 02:24:30,180
right now. You see, this is the song that I've been wanting us to play, um, during our

1587
02:24:30,180 --> 02:24:35,680
little, um, questions, and I dedicate this particular song to the dearly departed Oolong

1588
02:24:35,680 --> 02:24:40,780
the Bunny. We're going to cosplay Oolong the Bunny, aren't we?

1589
02:24:40,780 --> 02:24:44,320
I guess that's the plan, yep. That'd be fun.

1590
02:24:44,320 --> 02:24:47,780
I have costumes sort of designed. I'll have to draw it out for you. It's really cool.

1591
02:24:47,780 --> 02:24:51,780
I've got more plans. There's the pancake movie you can do.

1592
02:24:51,780 --> 02:24:55,780
I have to make leg warmers and I know how to do it.

1593
02:24:55,780 --> 02:24:59,780
You have to have the leg warmers and the bunny feet, but I know how to make bunny feet.

1594
02:24:59,780 --> 02:25:03,780
I know how to make bunny feet that fit over shoes.

1595
02:25:03,780 --> 02:25:07,780
All this bunny feet and leg warmer stuff has got me scared, okay? I just wanted ears and a pancake.

1596
02:25:07,780 --> 02:25:11,780
That's it. Ears, pancake, nothing else.

1597
02:25:11,780 --> 02:25:15,780
And this one's for Rob. I want sleep.

1598
02:25:15,780 --> 02:25:19,780
Or a pancake.

1599
02:25:19,780 --> 02:25:21,780
Keep in mind, I am a cosplayer.

1600
02:25:22,780 --> 02:25:26,780
Okay, anyway, we're gonna wait till we get a few more answers in.

1601
02:25:26,780 --> 02:25:32,780
So in the meantime, this is the song that we wanted to have for our Ask Orange Challenge.

1602
02:25:32,780 --> 02:25:39,780
the rabbits with Usaokun from Keyboard Mania.

1603
02:26:32,780 --> 02:26:36,780
Shonbori Usopu

1604
02:26:39,780 --> 02:26:43,780
Mibibori Usopu

1605
02:26:46,780 --> 02:26:50,780
Suso lando de wa

1606
02:26:50,780 --> 02:26:53,780
Inanaka Yoshi

1607
02:26:53,780 --> 02:26:57,780
Koro mo ashi ita mo mata

1608
02:26:57,780 --> 02:27:17,620
We're back, we're live, and our first question comes from 23rd Vegas, it said, what would

1609
02:27:17,620 --> 02:27:23,340
I do with a video of Ron Jeremy and two kawaii Japanese girls in a bucket of chocolate ready

1610
02:27:23,340 --> 02:27:24,340
whip?

1611
02:27:24,340 --> 02:27:27,580
I would go watch the video of Ron Jeremy.

1612
02:27:27,580 --> 02:27:33,960
I would send the two kawaii Japanese school girls to go buy me some booze.

1613
02:27:33,960 --> 02:27:36,900
And I would eat the bucket of chocolate ready whip.

1614
02:27:36,900 --> 02:27:40,260
Did Ulo the Bunny taste like chicken or pancakes?

1615
02:27:40,260 --> 02:27:42,880
He tasted like rabbit.

1616
02:27:42,880 --> 02:27:47,220
And from Dark Tetsuya, who is the most drunk?

1617
02:27:47,220 --> 02:27:51,060
I don't think you're drunk enough yet.

1618
02:27:51,060 --> 02:27:55,140
fall down the stairs

1619
02:27:55,140 --> 02:27:58,260
K, that fell over. I need to pick that up.

1620
02:27:58,260 --> 02:28:01,740
Don't stare at her. You don't have to.

1621
02:28:01,740 --> 02:28:05,060
No, don't clean my house! Oh, thank you.

1622
02:28:05,060 --> 02:28:08,820
Dude, Loki's cleaning my house. That's cool.

1623
02:28:08,820 --> 02:28:13,420
So, do you do windows?

1624
02:28:13,420 --> 02:28:17,460
I don't do windows.

1625
02:28:17,460 --> 02:28:25,600
what do I do windows don't ask me I've got the Mac my pretty little power book

1626
02:28:25,600 --> 02:28:39,700
is sitting right here I'm a little tipsy don't make me throw my empty flask at

1627
02:28:39,700 --> 02:28:50,980
you can I keep it yeah we were doing escort zones but only to you people care

1628
02:28:50,980 --> 02:28:58,100
so we're gonna do something else hey we have time for listless don't we all

1629
02:28:58,100 --> 02:29:00,900
right well there's only well why don't we do a list list that all four of us

1630
02:29:00,900 --> 02:29:13,180
can participate in how about okay alright we're going to do for our list

1631
02:29:13,180 --> 02:29:19,340
list we're going to do favorite alcohol for any reason whatsoever

1632
02:29:19,340 --> 02:29:23,980
here on Orange House radio in the meantime we'll go ahead and play more

1633
02:29:23,980 --> 02:29:29,260
music I think I have something I don't have some we have more questions is there

1634
02:29:29,260 --> 02:29:32,620
this week no because I'm not here next question

1635
02:29:32,620 --> 02:29:36,700
which is the better oxymoron microsoft works

1636
02:29:36,700 --> 02:29:40,920
legally drunk or military intelligence I think the only one of those really

1637
02:29:40,920 --> 02:29:42,540
counts as military intelligence

1638
02:29:42,540 --> 02:29:47,060
honest American I'm honest

1639
02:29:47,060 --> 02:29:50,540
I'll go to somebody and tell them that they fucking suck to their face

1640
02:29:50,540 --> 02:29:55,460
right military intelligence our nuclear weapons

1641
02:29:55,460 --> 02:29:58,660
on the hands of a man who cannot say jingle bells

1642
02:29:58,660 --> 02:30:01,900
there's a problem with that on a different subject yes

1643
02:30:01,900 --> 02:30:04,940
Jamie drives and Jamie driving

1644
02:30:04,940 --> 02:30:07,980
driving with Jamie is kind of fun because she will tell everyone

1645
02:30:07,980 --> 02:30:12,100
that they suck to their faces plus she will flip them off she will like

1646
02:30:12,100 --> 02:30:15,540
speed around them if they're slow she'll just go around them it's great it's so

1647
02:30:15,540 --> 02:30:16,240
entertaining

1648
02:30:16,240 --> 02:30:20,020
Jamie isn't called Dark Satoru for anything

1649
02:30:20,020 --> 02:30:23,380
she'll rage redeem your ass and then tap dance on your fucking grave like

1650
02:30:23,380 --> 02:30:24,420
Savvy and Glover

1651
02:30:24,420 --> 02:30:27,420
And then laugh at your family. It's great.

1652
02:30:27,420 --> 02:30:30,420
That sounds like fun. I should do that next time.

1653
02:30:32,420 --> 02:30:37,420
Okay, so I'm going to play a few songs while we come up with what are...

1654
02:30:37,420 --> 02:30:40,420
Why do people have to get political on Orange Dogs Radio? Fuck them.

1655
02:30:40,420 --> 02:30:44,420
That's because we're older than you, and we actually have something called maturity.

1656
02:30:44,420 --> 02:30:47,420
You can freestyle better than you can. That's it.

1657
02:30:47,420 --> 02:30:49,420
Because we can freestyle better than you can.

1658
02:30:49,420 --> 02:30:51,420
In both respects.

1659
02:30:51,420 --> 02:30:58,420
So let's go ahead and go.

1660
02:31:21,420 --> 02:31:23,420
Under the sun

1661
02:31:23,420 --> 02:31:25,420
She's forgotten everyone

1662
02:31:25,420 --> 02:31:27,420
And has some fun

1663
02:31:27,420 --> 02:31:29,420
Monkey magic

1664
02:31:29,420 --> 02:31:31,420
Monkey magic

1665
02:31:31,420 --> 02:31:33,420
Monkey magic

1666
02:31:33,420 --> 02:31:35,420
Monkey magic

1667
02:31:35,420 --> 02:31:37,420
Monkey magic

1668
02:31:39,420 --> 02:31:43,420
Little, little, little monkey magic

1669
02:31:43,420 --> 02:31:47,420
It's the very best of us

1670
02:31:47,420 --> 02:31:55,420
Since I've never been a monkey, but I do, there's nothing for me, I don't know, yeah

1671
02:32:00,420 --> 02:32:08,420
Oh, sun and egg on the mountain top, the punkiest monkey that ever struck

1672
02:32:08,420 --> 02:32:12,420
We knew every last thing under the sun

1673
02:32:12,420 --> 02:32:16,420
Take the gods and everyone and have some fun

1674
02:32:17,420 --> 02:32:21,420
Monkey Magic!

1675
02:32:21,420 --> 02:32:33,420
Monkey Magic

1676
02:32:51,420 --> 02:32:53,420
Oh

1677
02:34:51,420 --> 02:34:53,420
I

1678
02:37:21,420 --> 02:37:50,660
We're back, um, and we want to say bye to everybody?

1679
02:37:50,660 --> 02:37:57,660
Bye bye everyone, all the listeners of Orange Lounge, I am outta here, I am taking off for the night. Bye bye!

1680
02:37:57,660 --> 02:38:04,660
Thank you, take care, drive safely, bye wifey poo! Take care!

1681
02:38:04,660 --> 02:38:08,660
Thank you, thank you, not just to the people who've been over.

1682
02:38:08,660 --> 02:38:17,660
Okay, so we're back, we've all got our songs, so why don't we just go ahead and we'll start with Loki. What's your top number three alcohol?

1683
02:38:17,660 --> 02:38:20,660
Uh, because I don't drink alcohol.

1684
02:38:20,660 --> 02:38:24,660
Uh, we'll go with number three being Grog, because Monkey Island rules.

1685
02:38:26,660 --> 02:38:29,660
Okay, number three, Grog. And yours?

1686
02:38:30,660 --> 02:38:37,660
Number three on the totem pole would probably have to be, um, Smirnoff vanilla twist alcohol.

1687
02:38:37,660 --> 02:38:41,660
It's good shit. Perfect for mixing with drinks. Especially orange juice.

1688
02:38:43,660 --> 02:38:46,660
Vanilla and orange. Does it be like a cream soda, wouldn't it?

1689
02:38:46,660 --> 02:38:51,060
Okay, um, we actually did have another participant.

1690
02:38:51,060 --> 02:38:55,260
I'll go ahead and name my number three. My number three is Whaler's Vanilla Rum.

1691
02:38:55,260 --> 02:39:01,340
Yummy. I hold Mike now where she types in Whaler's Vanilla Rum, which is probably

1692
02:39:01,340 --> 02:39:02,220
really good stuff.

1693
02:39:02,220 --> 02:39:07,340
Our fourth participant is downstairs. Dark Sakura's going to get her right now.

1694
02:39:07,340 --> 02:39:10,580
She's getting the name of her favorite alcohol.

1695
02:39:10,580 --> 02:39:16,140
She's picking one. She's, uh,

1696
02:39:16,140 --> 02:39:18,500
She's giving us something to drink right now. I don't know

1697
02:39:20,020 --> 02:39:22,020
everybody

1698
02:39:23,860 --> 02:39:25,860
Everybody

1699
02:39:26,740 --> 02:39:30,980
Wait, here's melody with her third favorite alcohol vodka any of it

1700
02:39:31,860 --> 02:39:33,860
Any type of vodka?

1701
02:39:34,500 --> 02:39:36,500
number two favorite alcohol

1702
02:39:36,500 --> 02:39:41,500
Um, this is for Rob because I don't have a number two. Goldschlager.

1703
02:39:46,500 --> 02:39:48,500
So nasty.

1704
02:39:48,500 --> 02:40:01,500
Number two would have to be Sapporo Beer. Sapporo is the best beer, has high alcohol content, it's perfect with sushi, especially if you're watching schoolgirls with chicks in maid outfits doing their thing, it's great.

1705
02:40:01,500 --> 02:40:04,380
great works doesn't school guy uniforms

1706
02:40:04,380 --> 02:40:06,580
since anyway

1707
02:40:06,580 --> 02:40:08,260
actually i think it back

1708
02:40:08,260 --> 02:40:11,500
ron is number three part is number two

1709
02:40:11,500 --> 02:40:14,380
they uh...

1710
02:40:14,380 --> 02:40:15,780
my number three

1711
02:40:15,780 --> 02:40:16,700
is good either

1712
02:40:16,700 --> 02:40:18,860
of course chocolate liqueur

1713
02:40:18,860 --> 02:40:20,080
how can

1714
02:40:20,080 --> 02:40:22,820
that members inside

1715
02:40:22,820 --> 02:40:24,660
your number one

1716
02:40:24,660 --> 02:40:25,540
my number one

1717
02:40:25,540 --> 02:40:28,660
has to be peppermint schnapps because uh...

1718
02:40:28,660 --> 02:40:30,580
after about a full bottle of that

1719
02:40:30,580 --> 02:40:37,900
Both my ex-girlfriend and her friend, I think, went lesbian for, like, the night, so I dedicate

1720
02:40:37,900 --> 02:40:38,900
that to them.

1721
02:40:38,900 --> 02:40:40,180
How come you got in on that?

1722
02:40:40,180 --> 02:40:43,420
You know, that's one of those things that's going to kick me the rest of my life.

1723
02:40:43,420 --> 02:40:44,940
No, I did not.

1724
02:40:44,940 --> 02:40:45,940
Yep.

1725
02:40:45,940 --> 02:40:47,660
So, we think.

1726
02:40:47,660 --> 02:40:48,660
We don't know.

1727
02:40:48,660 --> 02:40:51,540
They disappeared into my room for a while, and they don't remember anything that went

1728
02:40:51,540 --> 02:40:52,540
on.

1729
02:40:52,540 --> 02:40:53,940
So they say.

1730
02:40:53,940 --> 02:40:54,940
So they say.

1731
02:40:54,940 --> 02:40:59,460
If your ex-girlfriend and girlfriend ever disappear into a room under the influence

1732
02:40:59,460 --> 02:41:05,260
of alcohol. You better be up in that motherfucker. Yeah, ex-girlfriend and her friend. Well,

1733
02:41:05,260 --> 02:41:09,420
she was my girlfriend at the time, so yeah, I should have, but... I would have been all

1734
02:41:09,420 --> 02:41:14,060
over that like a bad rash on Pamela Anderson-Lee. Number one would have to be the Godiva soy

1735
02:41:14,060 --> 02:41:17,980
milk combination that I had tonight with Dark Sakura. That's the new number one. It goes

1736
02:41:17,980 --> 02:41:22,260
down smooth and God damn, I'm buzzing. I'm so numb that somebody could cut my arm off

1737
02:41:22,260 --> 02:41:26,980
and beat me with it and I would not feel it. First off was, hey Jamie, you want to go in

1738
02:41:26,980 --> 02:41:30,180
that room five feet away and lock the door well you know they did say that

1739
02:41:30,180 --> 02:41:40,580
after I got socially drunk I turned lesbian and my number one has to be that

1740
02:41:40,580 --> 02:41:44,940
Vermeer chocolate liquor that Mel gave me because good lord that shit is good

1741
02:41:44,940 --> 02:41:50,260
v-e-r-m-e-e-r it's Dutch chocolate liquor and you can get in it Safeway

1742
02:41:50,260 --> 02:41:54,820
best shouts out to Felix the friendly traveler for providing the alcohol at

1743
02:41:54,820 --> 02:42:01,260
Go pick up any project that learns try find a feels friendly traveler do cuz that's dope shit Felix. You may never know

1744
02:42:01,780 --> 02:42:03,620
2003 I could come back

1745
02:42:03,620 --> 02:42:08,340
My number one would be just desserts brand creme brulee liqueur

1746
02:42:09,100 --> 02:42:12,100
You get it Trader Joe's that's the only this I've seen that one

1747
02:42:12,100 --> 02:42:16,660
And it's like six dollars a bottle and it tastes like it should cost more that stuff is the best

1748
02:42:18,860 --> 02:42:20,860
So you want to go ahead and vote off one

1749
02:42:20,860 --> 02:42:33,860
Okay, uh, just because someone else is going to vote it off and I'll just save them the time, Grog, because that's a stupid, uh, a stupid, uh, third pick by me and I just don't care. I'm tired.

1750
02:42:33,860 --> 02:42:40,860
Um, we have to get rid of the sapro even though it's one of my favorites because it is a...

1751
02:42:41,380 --> 02:42:46,140
I put it on there, but in comparison to the other alcohols, it's a beer. And beer just

1752
02:42:46,140 --> 02:42:50,900
doesn't stand up to liquor. Although it is an acquired taste, liquor has more of a flavor

1753
02:42:50,900 --> 02:42:55,900
to it. You can't mix liquor, you can mix liquor with anything, you can't mix beer with anything.

1754
02:42:55,900 --> 02:42:59,900
Vote one off the island.

1755
02:42:59,900 --> 02:43:03,620
Jerry, no, um, um,

1756
02:43:03,620 --> 02:43:08,780
what are our options? I'm saying rum because even though I voted it on

1757
02:43:08,780 --> 02:43:13,220
I got really freaking drunk on it once and it made me unhappy.

1758
02:43:13,220 --> 02:43:16,940
God, everyone's voting their own shit off. You left the light on in the bathroom?

1759
02:43:16,940 --> 02:43:21,300
Oh, that's why. Okay, um, well, you know what I'm gonna vote off?

1760
02:43:21,300 --> 02:43:25,580
Peppermint schnapps!

1761
02:43:25,580 --> 02:43:29,260
Because I've had peppermint schnapps before

1762
02:43:29,260 --> 02:43:32,260
And I thought it was going to kill me. It tasted like burning.

1763
02:43:32,260 --> 02:43:36,260
It tasted like burning heat.

1764
02:43:39,260 --> 02:43:42,260
And that's what they felt that night.

1765
02:43:42,260 --> 02:43:46,260
God damn it. See, Peppermint Schnoss, man.

1766
02:43:46,260 --> 02:43:49,260
That shit got my ex-girlfriend to yell,

1767
02:43:49,260 --> 02:43:53,260
I can suck his dick and you can't, arguing with her friend.

1768
02:43:53,260 --> 02:43:56,260
I just heard you say that you can suck someone's dick.

1769
02:43:56,260 --> 02:43:59,260
No, I was quoting my ex-girlfriend, okay?

1770
02:43:59,260 --> 02:44:03,260
There's absolutely nothing wrong with sucking dick as long as the person is clean.

1771
02:44:03,260 --> 02:44:05,260
Let's not get that twisted.

1772
02:44:05,260 --> 02:44:10,260
Although I don't know about Loki's sex life, the guy's cute enough, but that's another story too.

1773
02:44:10,260 --> 02:44:13,260
Don't say that shit while I've been drinking.

1774
02:44:13,260 --> 02:44:17,260
We're fucking listening, so obviously you only caught the last half.

1775
02:44:17,260 --> 02:44:20,260
I still want Gak's sexy body, but anyway.

1776
02:44:20,260 --> 02:44:23,260
Do I get to vote another one off now, or...?

1777
02:44:23,260 --> 02:44:25,600
ALLLL!

1778
02:44:25,600 --> 02:44:28,360
Bitch?

1779
02:44:28,360 --> 02:44:30,080
No!

1780
02:44:30,080 --> 02:44:31,240
Chat room,

1781
02:44:31,240 --> 02:44:33,780
this is where YOU decide!

1782
02:44:33,780 --> 02:44:35,940
Oh God, I didn't mean to loud.

1783
02:44:35,940 --> 02:44:38,960
To loud! I didn't mean to loud.

1784
02:44:38,960 --> 02:44:40,820
Ok, you've got

1785
02:44:40,820 --> 02:44:42,600
a few minutes

1786
02:44:42,600 --> 02:44:44,660
to send me your votes.

1787
02:44:44,660 --> 02:44:46,700
And if you don't send me your votes, I KILL YOU!

1788
02:44:46,700 --> 02:44:49,480
I mean... wait, I don't kill you.

1789
02:44:49,480 --> 02:44:50,360

1794
02:45:04,360 --> 02:45:08,280
and every read the list and then it was sent to the chair and

1795
02:45:08,280 --> 02:45:12,160
just give me a second kind of important

1796
02:45:12,160 --> 02:45:16,520

1797
02:45:16,520 --> 02:45:23,520
the

1798
02:45:23,520 --> 02:45:25,720

1799
02:45:25,720 --> 02:45:28,600
uh... there we go to him okay

1800
02:45:28,600 --> 02:45:30,680
so that's one of those

1801
02:45:30,680 --> 02:45:32,280
you have uh...

1802
02:45:32,280 --> 02:45:34,660
telling the stuff

1803
02:45:34,660 --> 02:45:37,000
three minutes and twenty five seconds

1804
02:45:37,000 --> 02:45:44,000
vote now or die

1805
02:45:44,000 --> 02:45:49,000
Ah, yeah. That's right, motherfuckers.

1806
02:45:49,000 --> 02:45:52,000
I'm back, riding a funky track.

1807
02:45:52,000 --> 02:45:57,000
I got a story to tell you all, so listen up.

1808
02:45:57,000 --> 02:46:00,000
Yo, trip on this.

1809
02:46:00,000 --> 02:46:05,000
I'm rolling through the boat on a Saturday night, got a 40 in my left hand dig in my right,

1810
02:46:05,000 --> 02:46:10,000
some cron in my lap, a pager in my hat, and a 9mm in the small of my back.

1811
02:46:10,000 --> 02:46:12,080
I'm just chillin, no place to be

1812
02:46:12,080 --> 02:46:14,400
I take another pro off my 40Z

1813
02:46:14,400 --> 02:46:16,800
I'm thinking about skinning a fat ass tree

1814
02:46:16,800 --> 02:46:19,200
A B to the L to the UMP

1815
02:46:19,200 --> 02:46:21,280
Then I get a call on my dope cell phone

1816
02:46:21,280 --> 02:46:22,640
Check the caller IP

1817
02:46:22,640 --> 02:46:23,760
What up hoes

1818
02:46:23,760 --> 02:46:25,840
Yo it's the Doom and his news ain't good

1819
02:46:25,840 --> 02:46:28,240
Little Pookie got capped last night in the hood

1820
02:46:28,240 --> 02:46:30,480
I feel like the world is fading away

1821
02:46:30,480 --> 02:46:33,040
I saw Little Pookie just the other day

1822
02:46:33,040 --> 02:46:35,360
Pookie was my oily shitted coid in the park

1823
02:46:35,360 --> 02:46:37,520
Now some punks took his life in the dark

1824
02:46:37,520 --> 02:46:42,160
I ask doomsday who the motherfuckers be to punk fb from MIT

1825
02:46:42,160 --> 02:46:44,400
The fucking institute man I should have known

1826
02:46:44,400 --> 02:46:46,880
I say meet me at my crib and hang up the phone

1827
02:46:46,880 --> 02:46:48,960
Playtime's over I got the job to do

1828
02:46:48,960 --> 02:46:51,360
And the world will be less crowded by the time I poop

1829
02:46:51,360 --> 02:46:53,600
And I'll keep rolling while bullets fly

1830
02:46:53,600 --> 02:46:56,220
cause all my shoamines be dry and biased

1831
02:47:13,800 --> 02:47:15,240
1 minute to midnight

1832
02:47:15,740 --> 02:47:16,740
we hit the street

1833
02:47:16,900 --> 02:47:18,040
code as a cadaver

1834
02:47:18,040 --> 02:47:19,180
our best concrete

1835
02:47:19,280 --> 02:47:20,340
doomsday packing

1836
02:47:20,440 --> 02:47:21,160
Baby Mac

1837
02:47:21,300 --> 02:47:22,660
Got my AK-47

1838
02:47:22,660 --> 02:47:27,560
of the nine in my back. The alpine's flowing, he's flowing, got my swerve on tight and my

1839
02:47:27,560 --> 02:47:33,060
game face showing. Him damn punks are gonna pay, the hawks on the case, a bird of prey.

1840
02:47:33,060 --> 02:47:38,420
Then up ahead, cold chilling in the street, six motherfuckers from MIT, I flick off the

1841
02:47:38,420 --> 02:47:44,020
safety check, my grip and load. A dumb dumb clip, I glance at the doom to make sure he's

1842
02:47:44,020 --> 02:47:49,300
packed, his dinkers on the traitor of his baby mac. Time to give a Newtonian demonstration

1843
02:47:49,300 --> 02:47:51,620
of the bullet, its mass and its acceleration

1844
02:47:51,620 --> 02:47:53,780
dying on my lap, AK in my hand

1845
02:47:53,780 --> 02:47:56,180
I roll up slow, like a snake in the sand

1846
02:47:56,180 --> 02:47:58,260
I wait till I'm sure they can see my face

1847
02:47:58,260 --> 02:48:00,820
then I bust out slugs to the beat of the bass

1848
02:48:00,820 --> 02:48:02,980
we sketch out in the full moonlight

1849
02:48:02,980 --> 02:48:05,140
MIT punks dying left and right

1850
02:48:05,140 --> 02:48:07,460
there's nowhere to run, don't even try

1851
02:48:07,460 --> 02:48:10,020
cause all my shoo-bings need drying pies

1852
02:48:10,020 --> 02:48:14,020
Don't drop by

1853
02:48:14,020 --> 02:48:18,020
Don't drop by

1854
02:48:18,020 --> 02:48:22,020
Don't drop by

1855
02:48:22,020 --> 02:48:26,020
Don't drop by

1856
02:48:30,020 --> 02:48:32,020
Then silence hits the street like a bomb

1857
02:48:32,020 --> 02:48:35,020
And eerie calm like the eye of the storm

1858
02:48:35,020 --> 02:48:37,020
Beneath the glow of an old street light

1859
02:48:37,020 --> 02:48:40,020
Dev MIT punks in the only site

1860
02:48:40,020 --> 02:48:42,020
Six motherfuckers no longer alive

1861
02:48:42,020 --> 02:48:44,020
Pooties in a vent one for one plus five

1862
02:48:44,020 --> 02:48:46,020
And we'll be long gone before the cops arrive

1863
02:48:46,020 --> 02:48:49,020
Cause all my shootings being drive-bys

1864
02:48:49,020 --> 02:48:50,020
Hi-yah!

1865
02:48:50,020 --> 02:48:55,020
I'm busting more shit than an incontinent man of a chilli tuck-off

1866
02:48:55,020 --> 02:48:57,020
The moral of the story is

1867
02:48:57,020 --> 02:48:59,020
Don't fuck with the Hawkman

1868
02:48:59,020 --> 02:49:02,020
Cause the Hawkman ain't done with the M-I-4 and I-4 shit

1869
02:49:02,020 --> 02:49:04,020
Fuck man

1870
02:49:04,020 --> 02:49:07,020
Take tonight, and I'll take your motherfucking head.

1871
02:49:07,020 --> 02:49:30,020
Please listen to Orange Lounge Radio, because real radio makes Captain Jack cry.

1872
02:49:30,020 --> 02:49:40,020
We're back. We almost have winners. In the meantime though, we're going to give the microphone

1873
02:49:40,020 --> 02:49:42,020
to Jockey to rant for a while.

1874
02:49:42,020 --> 02:49:49,020
Cool. I get to rant. I don't know it's a rant. They're discussing the alcohols right now.

1875
02:49:49,020 --> 02:49:54,020
They're doing rock, paper, scissors. They're still making a decision. If we have an afterbirth

1876
02:49:54,020 --> 02:49:58,020
tonight, I might kick some shit. I don't know. That was MC Hawking on the last track, one

1877
02:49:58,020 --> 02:50:01,700
one of the hardest motherfuckers I know with all my shootings be drive-bys

1878
02:50:01,700 --> 02:50:04,260
and I wouldn't fuck with them because they'll shoot you

1879
02:50:04,260 --> 02:50:08,500
all right well we have our three winners number three

1880
02:50:08,500 --> 02:50:10,340
Godiva and vanilla soy milk

1881
02:50:10,340 --> 02:50:13,900
combo

1882
02:50:13,900 --> 02:50:16,740
I'm going to get another one right now

1883
02:50:16,740 --> 02:50:20,940
second place is Smirnoff vanilla twist alcohol

1884
02:50:20,940 --> 02:50:22,460
and number one is

1885
02:50:22,460 --> 02:50:23,700
Godiva

1886
02:50:23,700 --> 02:50:27,140
yay!

1887
02:50:27,140 --> 02:50:29,140
None of those people had Vermeer!

1888
02:50:57,140 --> 02:51:00,140
Do we know where this can be found?

1889
02:51:00,140 --> 02:51:03,140
Nope. Can't remember offhand.

1890
02:51:03,140 --> 02:51:06,140
You see that box there with the mushrooms on the lid?

1891
02:51:06,140 --> 02:51:17,140
Those are 2600 ROMs and, uh, they're actually game chips and a thing to play them on a 2600.

1892
02:51:17,140 --> 02:51:18,140
Cool.

1893
02:51:18,140 --> 02:51:23,140
I think Custer's Revenge is in there somewhere.

1894
02:51:23,140 --> 02:51:27,140
Yeah, I'm real interested.

1895
02:51:27,140 --> 02:51:29,500
Pixelated penis.

1896
02:51:29,500 --> 02:51:32,180
Custer's revenge is so funny.

1897
02:51:32,180 --> 02:51:37,380
No, Custer's revenge for the 2600, the porn game.

1898
02:51:37,380 --> 02:51:38,860
Oh, sweet.

1899
02:51:38,860 --> 02:51:39,360
Yeah.

1900
02:51:39,360 --> 02:51:40,360
I didn't say porn game.

1901
02:51:40,360 --> 02:51:40,940
I don't know.

1902
02:51:40,940 --> 02:51:42,300
You said Custer.

1903
02:51:42,300 --> 02:51:43,620
Custer.

1904
02:51:43,620 --> 02:51:50,380
Anyway, did you ever see the one called X-Man?

1905
02:51:50,380 --> 02:51:57,620
It was this guy running through a maze, and you had to get through the middle of the maze,

1906
02:51:57,620 --> 02:52:00,420
being chased by a giant pair of scissors.

1907
02:52:00,420 --> 02:52:10,780
And then when you get to the end of the maze, what you have to do is fuck somebody.

1908
02:52:10,780 --> 02:52:12,820
And it's like pixelated cock and everything.

1909
02:52:12,820 --> 02:52:15,380
It's really, really scary and really wrong.

1910
02:52:15,380 --> 02:52:19,260
And anyway, on the note of pixelated cock, I think that we should go ahead and end this

1911
02:52:19,260 --> 02:52:21,260
bit of a wreck is you know what

1912
02:52:21,260 --> 02:52:24,280
i don't think i'm going to do very well in the junction of the next every week

1913
02:52:24,280 --> 02:52:25,620
so robs here

1914
02:52:25,620 --> 02:52:32,620
and then i'll take it let him be the silver one

1915
02:52:35,180 --> 02:52:39,300
so why don't we go ahead and then their final thoughts for the evening

1916
02:52:39,300 --> 02:52:42,300
i'm tired need to work on my website

1917
02:52:42,300 --> 02:52:47,140
yes you do

1918
02:52:47,140 --> 02:52:54,140
Sorry out there to all you people who just got, like, an earful of food's on.

1919
02:52:55,620 --> 02:52:59,660
There's a certain someone I'm waiting to give me a call on Valentine's Day. Hope she calls me.

1920
02:52:59,660 --> 02:53:02,900
Motherfuck Puff Daddy and a ton of other people in the industry.

1921
02:53:02,900 --> 02:53:06,700
I'm bitter, goddammit. Fuck Walmart. Fuck a whole bunch of other people.

1922
02:53:06,700 --> 02:53:10,220
Good dive on. Soy milk is really good. Thanks to

1923
02:53:10,220 --> 02:53:14,820
Jamie for allowing me to speak on OrangeLounge.com

1924
02:53:14,820 --> 02:53:16,820
And

1925
02:53:17,460 --> 02:53:19,260
That's it

1926
02:53:19,260 --> 02:53:25,260
Sadly enough after what like five or six drinks. I'm still not

1927
02:53:26,180 --> 02:53:28,440
I'm still not drunk that bad

1928
02:53:29,740 --> 02:53:31,660
so I

1929
02:53:31,660 --> 02:53:35,540
Wish I could go to the strip club, but that's a lot of money, and I don't have the money

1930
02:53:35,540 --> 02:53:46,180
So let's go ahead and end this trainwreck, stay tuned though for a special, messy surprise.

1931
02:53:46,180 --> 02:53:52,900
