1
00:00:05,111 --> 00:00:08,613
[SPEAKER_16]: Do you want to hear the most annoying sound in the world?

2
00:00:10,614 --> 00:00:15,676
[SPEAKER_06]: You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio, the Monty Talk, and then some.

3
00:00:18,117 --> 00:00:20,058
[SPEAKER_06]: ...contain many four-letter words.

4
00:00:20,639 --> 00:00:23,400
[SPEAKER_06]: Orange Lounge may contain a scene of nudity.

5
00:00:23,901 --> 00:00:26,803
[SPEAKER_06]: Orange Lounge may contain hot monkey sex.

6
00:00:27,603 --> 00:00:28,003
[SPEAKER_06]: Just kidding.

7
00:00:28,204 --> 00:00:29,805
[SPEAKER_00]: Orange Lounge will not contain hot monkey sex.

8
00:00:30,025 --> 00:00:37,189
[SPEAKER_14]: In this episode... Hey, are there any girls down there?

9
00:00:37,209 --> 00:00:40,251
[SPEAKER_14]: That's the biggest fairy I've ever seen, Jingle Fairy.

00:00:40,331 --> 00:00:43,173
[SPEAKER_14]: What's your favorite scary movie?

[SPEAKER_14]: Showgirls.

[SPEAKER_16]: DarkSakura

13
00:01:15,373 --> 00:01:20,235
[SPEAKER_11]: My computer sucks, so I can't play the intro, so we'll just pretend.

14
00:01:20,255 --> 00:01:21,436
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh wait, we're live.

15
00:01:41,417 --> 00:01:42,818
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, we're live!

16
00:01:43,679 --> 00:01:44,680
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, everybody's downstairs.

[SPEAKER_03]: Today is February 16th, 2003.

[SPEAKER_03]: This is episode 33 of Orange Lounge Radio.

19
00:01:52,306 --> 00:01:53,167
[SPEAKER_03]: And Rob's not here.

20
00:01:53,267 --> 00:01:54,308
[SPEAKER_03]: We took over, didn't we?

21
00:01:55,529 --> 00:01:56,090
[SPEAKER_22]: Uh, yeah, we did.

22
00:01:57,531 --> 00:01:59,713
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, let's get the intros out of the way.

23
00:02:00,053 --> 00:02:02,015
[SPEAKER_03]: All you people who are downstairs!

24
00:02:05,117 --> 00:02:05,478
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

[SPEAKER_22]: Um, I'm Jamie, DarkSakura, yay, this is our tech master Loki, ah, stupid McDonald's, feels like that there's like a balloon in my stomach, and that's no good Ugh, and then everyone else is downstairs playing Animal Crossing So, yeah

[SPEAKER_03]: This is also our second official drunk show.

27
00:02:34,776 --> 00:02:38,577
[SPEAKER_03]: I've already had two beverages and I ain't feeling a thing.

28
00:02:41,377 --> 00:02:41,838
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

29
00:02:42,138 --> 00:02:44,758
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to go ahead and just say, screw the intros.

30
00:02:44,798 --> 00:02:45,838
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll get it done afterwards.

31
00:02:45,898 --> 00:02:47,139
[SPEAKER_03]: So we'll go ahead and go to break.

32
00:02:48,259 --> 00:02:50,920
[SPEAKER_03]: That means we get to break things while you get to listen to cool music.

33
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:52,100
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

38
00:10:00,401 --> 00:10:06,523
[SPEAKER_12]: Now hey, if you're a broke ass like I am, why don't you come to the one place that costs absolutely nothing to go to and still the fun is just as great.

39
00:10:06,863 --> 00:10:08,743
[SPEAKER_12]: It's Orange Lounge Radio, Sunday nights.

[SPEAKER_03]: We're back.

00:10:16,266 --> 00:10:16,826

[SPEAKER_03]: And people are still playing Animal Crossing, but that's okay.

[SPEAKER_03]: Animal Crack.

45
00:10:23,252 --> 00:10:25,093
[SPEAKER_03]: We have one of our special guests up here, though.

46
00:10:25,193 --> 00:10:25,653
[SPEAKER_03]: Say hi.

47
00:10:26,574 --> 00:10:27,254
[SPEAKER_25]: Yo, what's up?

48
00:10:27,274 --> 00:10:30,075
[SPEAKER_25]: This is Jay Kinetic, representing Step Spot in the Bay Area.

49
00:10:30,196 --> 00:10:30,956
[SPEAKER_25]: How you doing, Jamie?

50
00:10:32,217 --> 00:10:34,118
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm on my way to intoxication.

51
00:10:34,498 --> 00:10:34,958
[SPEAKER_03]: I see this.

52
00:10:35,278 --> 00:10:37,820
[SPEAKER_03]: You're already a glass ahead of me.

53
00:10:38,786 --> 00:10:40,648
[SPEAKER_25]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

54
00:10:58,564 --> 00:10:59,765
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a microphone in my face.

55
00:11:00,045 --> 00:11:00,405
[SPEAKER_03]: Shit.

56
00:11:02,827 --> 00:11:03,968
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, Sky Vodka.

57
00:11:04,128 --> 00:11:06,770
[SPEAKER_25]: I'll take phrases that Mariah Carey's gotten used to for 500.

58
00:11:07,010 --> 00:11:09,052
[SPEAKER_25]: Ah, there's a microphone in my face!

59
00:11:10,433 --> 00:11:11,113
[SPEAKER_03]: That was wrong.

60
00:11:12,974 --> 00:11:13,855
[SPEAKER_03]: And how are you doing tonight?

61
00:11:15,256 --> 00:11:20,880
[SPEAKER_22]: I was doing good until I ate something, and that something happened to be McDonald's, and then McDonald's is ripping me up.

62
00:11:22,101 --> 00:11:24,603
[SPEAKER_25]: What you want is what you vomit at McDonald's today.

63
00:11:26,218 --> 00:11:30,936
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, then McDonald's is going to need a PR campaign to undo all the damage you just did.

64
00:11:32,352 --> 00:11:44,038
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, actually, yesterday I wasn't feeling too good either, or the day before, because I made this spaghetti with this really cool sauce I got off the internet, like this recipe off of Robert and Don, the radio show I listen to every morning.

65
00:11:44,638 --> 00:11:53,563
[SPEAKER_22]: And it was really good, but the thing is, it calls for two full bulbs of garlic ground up, along with a large red onion.

66
00:11:53,583 --> 00:12:00,627
[SPEAKER_22]: So you have pretty much like this, half of it is onion and garlic, and then the rest is all tomatoes and stuff, and it's really good.

67
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:07,751
[SPEAKER_22]: The problem is, when you have that much garlic, you just eat a little bit of it and it makes your stomach really, really gassy.

68
00:12:08,951 --> 00:12:09,672
[SPEAKER_25]: Well, actually, no.

69
00:12:09,692 --> 00:12:13,774
[SPEAKER_25]: The problem is you'll need about three bottles of Listerine after you eat two bulbs of garlic and a red onion.

70
00:12:13,934 --> 00:12:17,256
[SPEAKER_25]: I mean, God, you could probably breathe on somebody and it's probably, like, toxic.

71
00:12:19,177 --> 00:12:20,977
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, so it was really good.

72
00:12:21,638 --> 00:12:25,960
[SPEAKER_22]: It just felt like you eat just a little bit of it and you feel, like, full already.

73
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:27,081
[SPEAKER_22]: And it's weird.

74
00:12:27,101 --> 00:12:27,801
[SPEAKER_22]: It's the weirdest feeling.

75
00:12:27,821 --> 00:12:28,601
[SPEAKER_22]: You just feel full.

76
00:12:29,102 --> 00:12:29,422
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't know.

77
00:12:30,683 --> 00:12:33,425
[SPEAKER_25]: Now the worst time I had was when I prepared some spaghetti.

78
00:12:33,445 --> 00:12:42,991
[SPEAKER_25]: I was cooking for my ex at the time and she'd come over and I was cooking and I threw something that wasn't tobacco into the spaghetti sauce along with some alcohol.

79
00:12:44,481 --> 00:12:46,543
[SPEAKER_25]: I didn't feel the effects for the first 30 minutes.

80
00:12:46,583 --> 00:12:50,927
[SPEAKER_25]: I sat down to use my computer after she went home, and all of a sudden that hit me like Viking and I was out.

81
00:12:51,027 --> 00:12:52,288
[SPEAKER_25]: It was scary.

82
00:12:52,789 --> 00:12:53,409
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, there's Shermie.

83
00:12:53,890 --> 00:12:54,771
[SPEAKER_03]: If you look very slowly.

84
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:56,032
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, she just went back under the thing.

85
00:12:56,392 --> 00:12:59,695
[SPEAKER_03]: Shermie decided to peek out and say hi to everybody, but then she went back under the bed.

86
00:13:01,317 --> 00:13:02,258
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, poor baby.

87
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:06,022
[SPEAKER_25]: So what's the topic tonight anyway?

88
00:13:06,621 --> 00:13:07,041
[SPEAKER_03]: The topic?

89
00:13:07,581 --> 00:13:09,082
[SPEAKER_03]: The topic is, Rob ain't here!

90
00:13:09,302 --> 00:13:10,022
[SPEAKER_03]: Party time!

91
00:13:11,242 --> 00:13:14,043
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, he decided to go down to that Cyber Beat Nation thing.

92
00:13:14,583 --> 00:13:15,384
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, huh?

93
00:13:18,024 --> 00:13:19,645
[SPEAKER_03]: Melody said like there's never a topic on the show.

94
00:13:19,705 --> 00:13:20,705
[SPEAKER_03]: Come up here, Melody!

95
00:13:22,846 --> 00:13:24,987
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah, we have our models in here tonight, DarkSakura.

96
00:13:25,007 --> 00:13:25,887
[SPEAKER_25]: Melody's on her way up.

97
00:13:25,947 --> 00:13:28,748
[SPEAKER_25]: She's having a hard time getting up the stairs because Animal Crack is calling her.

98
00:13:28,768 --> 00:13:29,368
[SPEAKER_25]: Say hi, Melody.

99
00:13:30,149 --> 00:13:32,650
[SPEAKER_28]: No, I'm having a hard time coming up the stairs because I'm half drunk.

100
00:13:33,150 --> 00:13:34,211
[SPEAKER_28]: That's the reason why.

101
00:13:35,011 --> 00:13:36,192
[SPEAKER_11]: Lightweight.

102
00:13:36,972 --> 00:13:38,092
[SPEAKER_28]: Lightweight.

103
00:13:38,433 --> 00:13:40,553
[SPEAKER_28]: Yes, I'm a lightweight and I'm damn proud of it, okay?

104
00:13:40,593 --> 00:13:41,814
[SPEAKER_28]: That means I'm a cheap date.

105
00:13:43,435 --> 00:13:45,996
[SPEAKER_25]: Ooh, shouts out to Mel down at Cyber Beat Nation.

106
00:13:46,036 --> 00:13:50,638
[SPEAKER_25]: I heard Tigger, did Tigger take first in a... Okay, we're going to announce that.

107
00:13:50,658 --> 00:13:51,478
[SPEAKER_25]: Sorry, I didn't want to ruin it.

108
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:56,242
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to go ahead and... Yeah, what's this topic?

109
00:13:56,322 --> 00:13:56,542
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

110
00:13:57,823 --> 00:14:00,464
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to go ahead and announce the winners of Cyber Beat Nation.

111
00:14:01,665 --> 00:14:03,766
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll start with 2DX.

[SPEAKER_03]: Second place, we have... Thank you.

00:14:20,073 --> 00:14:21,554
[SPEAKER_25]: Shouts to Canada, though.

119
00:14:21,914 --> 00:14:22,834
[SPEAKER_25]: Much love to Canada, though.

120
00:14:22,874 --> 00:14:24,555
[SPEAKER_25]: Y'all got good women.

121
00:14:24,575 --> 00:14:25,855
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, second place, JS Blade.

122
00:14:25,895 --> 00:14:26,695
[SPEAKER_24]: No, no, no.

123
00:14:26,956 --> 00:14:27,796
[SPEAKER_24]: No, they have good laws.

124
00:14:29,056 --> 00:14:31,037
[SPEAKER_24]: No, Canada, props to Canada for having good laws.

125
00:14:33,878 --> 00:14:34,698
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, say hi.

126
00:14:35,018 --> 00:14:35,598
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello, people.

127
00:14:36,698 --> 00:14:38,959
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and in first place, for PA, we have Tigger.

128
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:41,620
[SPEAKER_03]: Like we're surprised!

129
00:14:42,859 --> 00:14:43,600
[SPEAKER_26]: Oh, my God!

130
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:44,701
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, heart attack!

131
00:14:44,741 --> 00:14:45,582
[SPEAKER_03]: Tigger won PA!

132
00:14:45,782 --> 00:14:46,723
[SPEAKER_26]: Oh, God, it hurts!

133
00:14:47,223 --> 00:14:47,343
Ah!

134
00:14:47,784 --> 00:14:49,205
[SPEAKER_26]: Oh, fuck, I'm dying!

135
00:14:49,325 --> 00:14:51,587
[SPEAKER_03]: I was just still pretty thrilled that Rob beat Rhea at Fremont.

136
00:14:51,908 --> 00:14:52,909
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, true, true, true.

137
00:14:52,949 --> 00:14:55,491
[SPEAKER_25]: Respect to Tigger, though, because that's one of the coolest PA-ers I've met.

138
00:14:55,511 --> 00:14:56,772
[SPEAKER_25]: He never got an ego about this shit.

139
00:14:56,792 --> 00:14:57,333
[SPEAKER_25]: Shouts to him.

140
00:14:57,813 --> 00:14:58,093
[SPEAKER_25]: Okay.

141
00:14:58,914 --> 00:14:59,555
[SPEAKER_03]: Freestyle.

142
00:15:00,396 --> 00:15:03,739
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a total NorCal showing, except for, like, one person.

143
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:07,642
[SPEAKER_03]: In fourth place, our very own Step Squad boy, Wendell.

144
00:15:07,863 --> 00:15:08,183
[SPEAKER_03]: Book, book!

145
00:15:09,561 --> 00:15:12,482
[SPEAKER_03]: and third place we have AJ of, um, RTF.

146
00:15:14,882 --> 00:15:18,623
[SPEAKER_03]: Second place, I think I got this right because I could barely hear Rob when he told me Master 42.

147
00:15:19,284 --> 00:15:20,664
[SPEAKER_03]: If I have that wrong, I'll correct it.

148
00:15:21,164 --> 00:15:22,885
[SPEAKER_03]: And in first place, Bruce Leroy.

149
00:15:25,385 --> 00:15:30,206
[SPEAKER_03]: So, he won a Max 2 machine, which means everyone's gonna go hang out at his house.

150
00:15:32,107 --> 00:15:34,468
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, so that was a...

151
00:15:37,071 --> 00:15:42,453
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a pretty good showing there for NorCal, so... Fuck NorCal, fuck you!

152
00:15:42,693 --> 00:15:46,175
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck NorCal, fuck you!

153
00:15:46,935 --> 00:15:51,777
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, no, no, we have to be nice to our out-of-state people because... You said it first!

154
00:15:51,957 --> 00:15:54,899
[SPEAKER_03]: Keep in mind, I lived in Alabama where we had no bimani.

155
00:15:54,919 --> 00:15:56,839
[SPEAKER_03]: When I went there to visit in April, you know what they had?

156
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:58,800
[SPEAKER_03]: A Korean Dance Maniacs.

157
00:15:59,861 --> 00:16:00,541
[SPEAKER_26]: Oh my god!

158
00:16:01,381 --> 00:16:02,542
[SPEAKER_25]: Down in Newark...

159
00:16:03,450 --> 00:16:10,373
[SPEAKER_25]: Down at Newark, in New Park Mall, I think Ross was with me when I played this, uh, they have Dance Maniacs, in Korean!

160
00:16:11,453 --> 00:16:12,593
[SPEAKER_25]: Dance Freaks, in Korean!

161
00:16:12,813 --> 00:16:16,715
[SPEAKER_25]: I've never played this game before and I was amazed by this, I'm like, they have Korean songs on this?

162
00:16:17,015 --> 00:16:19,796
[SPEAKER_25]: Didn't they have, uh, uh, Kleon, Funky Tonight or something?

163
00:16:21,437 --> 00:16:22,397
[SPEAKER_25]: They had another Klon song.

164
00:16:24,588 --> 00:16:29,872
[SPEAKER_24]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

165
00:16:47,727 --> 00:16:52,170
[SPEAKER_03]: But no, I found out that they recently got a Beatmania, an actual Beatmania machine.

166
00:16:53,271 --> 00:17:00,936
[SPEAKER_03]: Just in the hallway at the mall outside the movie theater that the mall I used to work at, which actually, if what I understand correctly, is actually where my arcade used to be.

167
00:17:01,176 --> 00:17:02,337
[SPEAKER_03]: But they moved the arcade further down.

168
00:17:03,658 --> 00:17:04,979
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and Latin's Castle.

169
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:08,202
[SPEAKER_03]: I worked for Namco at one time.

170
00:17:09,002 --> 00:17:11,844
[SPEAKER_03]: I worked at Cyberzone.

171
00:17:13,505 --> 00:17:14,006
[SPEAKER_03]: Cyberstation.

172
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:22,944
[SPEAKER_25]: Oh yeah, this show of ours has been brought to you by Islander's Crooked Eye Special Brew, a unique malt beverage with natural flavors.

173
00:17:23,364 --> 00:17:25,545
[SPEAKER_25]: That's code word for it gets you fucked up.

174
00:17:27,887 --> 00:17:28,907
[SPEAKER_24]: He wouldn't let me buy the Schlitz.

175
00:17:29,267 --> 00:17:30,448
[SPEAKER_24]: He just wouldn't let me buy the Schlitz.

176
00:17:30,468 --> 00:17:31,329
[SPEAKER_24]: I wanted the Schlitz.

177
00:17:32,145 --> 00:17:34,947
[SPEAKER_24]: I wanted to shlitz, I wanted to represent- IT'S SHLITZ!

178
00:17:35,007 --> 00:17:35,427
[SPEAKER_03]: I'LL KILL YOU!

179
00:17:35,447 --> 00:17:36,387
[SPEAKER_03]: No, you know what you need?

180
00:17:36,548 --> 00:17:38,589
[SPEAKER_03]: What you need is an ice-cold Colt 45.

181
00:17:38,829 --> 00:17:42,911
[SPEAKER_24]: You know, if we didn't have that, I would've, I would've, but he would've let me!

182
00:17:43,071 --> 00:17:44,932
[SPEAKER_03]: Somewhere Billy Dee Williams is having a cry.

183
00:17:45,372 --> 00:17:46,673
[SPEAKER_24]: I know, I know he is.

184
00:17:47,994 --> 00:17:49,875
[SPEAKER_24]: You're being awfully- He's just so smooth.

185
00:17:50,355 --> 00:17:51,376
[SPEAKER_03]: You're being awfully quiet.

186
00:17:53,057 --> 00:17:54,638
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, that's because I feel like a blimp.

187
00:17:55,738 --> 00:17:56,739
[SPEAKER_22]: I feel fat.

188
00:17:59,563 --> 00:18:00,444
[SPEAKER_22]: and Sassy.

189
00:18:10,128 --> 00:18:12,909
[SPEAKER_25]: The chat room is like, what the hell is wrong with these people?

190
00:18:16,111 --> 00:18:25,435
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if any of you are old enough to remember this, but late night TV did show the 40 ounce liquor alcohol, they do one for Colt 45, with Billy Dee Williams at a party.

191
00:18:27,712 --> 00:18:28,994
[SPEAKER_03]: Cult 45, Red Dog, Urban Beers, Water and Piss

192
00:18:45,592 --> 00:18:47,934
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, when I lived in, I lived in the hood at one time.

193
00:18:50,595 --> 00:18:51,736
[SPEAKER_03]: Del Paso Heights.

194
00:18:54,418 --> 00:18:58,441
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you could tell at one time, maybe back in the 50s, it was a nice neighborhood.

195
00:18:58,521 --> 00:19:06,246
[SPEAKER_03]: But the place was all like, you know, the houses were, there were some, you know, hood houses and dogs running down the street.

196
00:19:06,306 --> 00:19:08,787
[SPEAKER_03]: People would go down with their loud bass while I'm trying to sleep at 4 in the morning.

197
00:19:09,488 --> 00:19:14,771
[SPEAKER_03]: And on New Year's Eve, our friend Tina, we call her Beanie, she came over.

198
00:19:15,972 --> 00:19:20,737
[SPEAKER_03]: While we were having our big anime marathon, we were watching Cowboy Bebop.

199
00:19:21,778 --> 00:19:25,903
[SPEAKER_03]: And we were playing Samba de Amigo and she brought me a 40 ounce Corona.

200
00:19:27,156 --> 00:19:33,939
[SPEAKER_03]: and said, but I felt inclined to go drink it on my couch, but I didn't have chairs or a couch.

201
00:19:34,819 --> 00:19:36,299
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah.

202
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:38,340
[SPEAKER_25]: That's the sad thing.

203
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:39,701
[SPEAKER_25]: I mean, I'm from the slums.

204
00:19:40,181 --> 00:19:43,162
[SPEAKER_25]: I originally spent like half of my existence in Oakland, California.

205
00:19:43,562 --> 00:19:50,665
[SPEAKER_25]: And what's sad about Oakland is that there are three things that you will find in most neighborhoods, and that's a liquor store, a nail shop,

206
00:19:52,063 --> 00:19:53,425
[SPEAKER_25]: and like a church.

207
00:19:54,065 --> 00:19:57,509
[SPEAKER_25]: You'll find those all within a block proximity of each other.

208
00:19:57,529 --> 00:19:59,251
[SPEAKER_03]: There are five churches by my house in DPH.

209
00:20:00,106 --> 00:20:01,948
[SPEAKER_25]: You don't need five churches in one neighborhood.

210
00:20:01,988 --> 00:20:02,728
[SPEAKER_25]: That's scary.

211
00:20:03,209 --> 00:20:07,212
[SPEAKER_25]: But we saw this, and they'd all be selling the most crappy beers on the planet.

212
00:20:07,252 --> 00:20:10,835
[SPEAKER_25]: We're talking like Natural Ice and like Schlitz and like Red Dog.

213
00:20:11,236 --> 00:20:14,718
[SPEAKER_25]: You name it, and it's a ghetto beer that you probably saw an advertisement for in the source.

214
00:20:14,779 --> 00:20:17,521
[SPEAKER_25]: They had it, and it was just bad, and you knew it was a rig up.

215
00:20:17,921 --> 00:20:19,062
[SPEAKER_25]: But you couldn't do anything about it.

216
00:20:19,402 --> 00:20:24,146
[SPEAKER_25]: So I guess the idea was you drank your Mad Dog 2020 and went to church because that was the only way you could put up with the people there.

217
00:20:24,166 --> 00:20:24,607
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm not sure.

218
00:20:25,871 --> 00:20:27,311
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you know what?

219
00:20:27,511 --> 00:20:30,072
[SPEAKER_03]: It's funny that we're talking about alcohol on a Ben Monte show.

220
00:20:30,192 --> 00:20:30,732
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah!

221
00:20:31,453 --> 00:20:32,833
[SPEAKER_03]: Have you ever tried to play DDR Drunk?

222
00:20:35,134 --> 00:20:40,915
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm happy to say that I got a ton of perfects while I was off of four TGI Fridays drinks, despite the fact that they were weak.

223
00:20:41,295 --> 00:20:48,938
[SPEAKER_25]: I was not drunk enough yet, so I went to the store, got two pints of Sapporo beer, good stuff, went up to the DDR machine and was scoring B's and A's all day.

224
00:20:48,958 --> 00:20:50,398
[SPEAKER_25]: It's all about Drunk Drunk Revolution.

225
00:20:51,124 --> 00:20:54,385
[SPEAKER_03]: First night I met Wendell at Faname of 2001.

226
00:20:55,525 --> 00:20:58,925
[SPEAKER_03]: He proceeded to beat Afronova Maniac while drunk.

227
00:21:00,686 --> 00:21:02,426
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't think he's been able to do it sober, right?

228
00:21:03,706 --> 00:21:04,566
[SPEAKER_03]: That was awesome.

229
00:21:05,566 --> 00:21:06,427
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm not quite sure.

230
00:21:07,147 --> 00:21:13,448
[SPEAKER_25]: I would DDR naked with the right person, but you'd have to have a private machine, because I don't want my wang flapping around.

231
00:21:13,968 --> 00:21:15,888
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't have upskirt can, thank you very much.

232
00:21:15,928 --> 00:21:17,108
[SPEAKER_03]: I have played DDR in my pajamas.

233
00:21:18,549 --> 00:21:20,869
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're a woman playing DDR without a bra, it's painful.

234
00:21:22,674 --> 00:21:23,875
[SPEAKER_22]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

235
00:21:40,991 --> 00:21:43,274
[SPEAKER_22]: Actually, there's quite a bit going on.

236
00:21:44,355 --> 00:21:54,747
[SPEAKER_22]: New Stepmania, our new CVS update for February 12th CVS snapshot for that.

237
00:21:54,847 --> 00:21:58,651
[SPEAKER_22]: They're really making it sort of like, it's becoming more of...

238
00:21:59,592 --> 00:22:01,935
[SPEAKER_22]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

239
00:22:16,711 --> 00:22:17,391
[SPEAKER_22]: It's really cool.

240
00:22:18,091 --> 00:22:23,093
[SPEAKER_22]: They also have added Marvelouses and a whole bunch of new modifiers on there now.

241
00:22:23,133 --> 00:22:27,574
[SPEAKER_22]: They have one that's called Land, which is just like in the Oni Course trick.

242
00:22:29,054 --> 00:22:32,555
[SPEAKER_22]: It's kind of a reverse boost where it slows way down.

243
00:22:32,935 --> 00:22:40,296
[SPEAKER_22]: They have one called Expand, where it kind of just expands and contracts as it goes up the screen.

244
00:22:40,477 --> 00:22:41,237
[SPEAKER_22]: And then they've got...

245
00:22:42,657 --> 00:22:43,458
[SPEAKER_22]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

246
00:23:01,613 --> 00:23:03,335
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm still working on my website.

247
00:23:03,375 --> 00:23:11,966
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm taking my time though because I'm going to be adding CD titles to everything and just making sure it's fully done that way.

248
00:23:12,066 --> 00:23:15,610
[SPEAKER_22]: I have a full set of DDR Extreme sim files that will be coming up.

249
00:23:17,513 --> 00:23:19,134
[SPEAKER_22]: Everything that's released so far, of course.

250
00:23:19,975 --> 00:23:22,597
[SPEAKER_22]: And then, let's see what else.

251
00:23:23,558 --> 00:23:24,779
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't know, a whole bunch of shit.

252
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:29,503
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, DWI Insanity, they just released A.U.

253
00:23:30,464 --> 00:23:33,747
[SPEAKER_22]: Trance 2, a non-stop DWI.

254
00:23:34,267 --> 00:23:35,529
[SPEAKER_22]: It's 35 minutes long.

255
00:23:36,970 --> 00:23:37,851
[SPEAKER_22]: I played it last night.

256
00:23:39,212 --> 00:23:43,476
[SPEAKER_22]: After about 20 minutes, your hand just... It doesn't hurt anymore, but...

257
00:23:43,996 --> 00:23:44,897
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, that was pretty fun.

258
00:23:45,097 --> 00:23:52,887
[SPEAKER_22]: And then, let's see, other than that, BomaniSell switched to a new server thanks to kind donations from the community.

259
00:23:53,127 --> 00:23:56,271
[SPEAKER_22]: And so they should be bringing up more sim files on that site, too.

260
00:23:56,731 --> 00:23:58,974
[SPEAKER_22]: Probably see the rest of DDR Extreme stuff come up.

261
00:23:59,314 --> 00:24:01,116
[SPEAKER_22]: And same with DDR UK.

262
00:24:01,156 --> 00:24:03,839
[SPEAKER_22]: They've just re-put up all their new stuff on new...

263
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:08,161
[SPEAKER_22]: We should also make a mention about our contest.

264
00:24:26,776 --> 00:24:30,979
[SPEAKER_22]: Our old TV themed DWI contest.

265
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:37,603
[SPEAKER_22]: We don't really have a due date yet, but it's going to be done to any old TV theme.

266
00:24:38,483 --> 00:24:39,204
[SPEAKER_22]: Only TV themes.

267
00:24:39,504 --> 00:24:41,825
[SPEAKER_22]: Or were we doing just TV themes?

268
00:24:41,845 --> 00:24:43,626
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, so old TV themes DWI.

269
00:24:43,827 --> 00:24:44,507
[SPEAKER_22]: No remixes.

270
00:24:45,087 --> 00:24:46,008
[SPEAKER_22]: Original TV themes.

271
00:24:47,392 --> 00:24:48,873
[SPEAKER_25]: I want to see some of those TV themes.

272
00:24:48,913 --> 00:24:50,955
[SPEAKER_25]: I want to see, like, Greatest American Hero.

273
00:24:51,115 --> 00:24:52,496
[SPEAKER_25]: I want to see Silver Spoons.

274
00:24:53,077 --> 00:24:54,098
[SPEAKER_25]: I want to see the A-Team.

275
00:24:54,218 --> 00:24:56,600
[SPEAKER_25]: If somebody did one to Small Wonder, that'd be crazy.

276
00:24:58,181 --> 00:25:00,543
[SPEAKER_03]: I looked for the Small Wonder theme to play on the pre-show, and I couldn't find it.

277
00:25:02,425 --> 00:25:06,969
[SPEAKER_22]: I've only got one TV theme that's actually into a DWI, and that's Nash Bridges' theme.

278
00:25:08,970 --> 00:25:09,991
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what one would be fun?

279
00:25:10,071 --> 00:25:11,612
[SPEAKER_03]: I just thought of Bonanza.

280
00:25:12,313 --> 00:25:12,834
[SPEAKER_02]: Banana!

281
00:25:17,601 --> 00:25:19,163
[SPEAKER_02]: I AM A BANANA!

282
00:25:20,424 --> 00:25:22,646
[SPEAKER_13]: My food is too big!

283
00:25:22,686 --> 00:25:25,688
[SPEAKER_22]: You're watching a family emergency.

284
00:25:26,869 --> 00:25:28,591
[SPEAKER_25]: Uh... Yeah!

285
00:25:29,031 --> 00:25:30,452
[SPEAKER_25]: My guy... Airwolf!

286
00:25:30,853 --> 00:25:31,233
Yes!

287
00:25:32,154 --> 00:25:33,675
[SPEAKER_25]: No, no, I just had it.

288
00:25:33,755 --> 00:25:35,436
[SPEAKER_25]: The Price is Right would be a good one.

289
00:25:36,297 --> 00:25:39,960
[SPEAKER_25]: Um, the other one that I wanted to see... God, it was just in my brain.

290
00:25:40,221 --> 00:25:41,922
[SPEAKER_25]: The years of marijuana have fucked me up.

291
00:25:42,683 --> 00:25:42,743
[SPEAKER_25]: Um...

292
00:25:43,911 --> 00:25:44,991
[SPEAKER_25]: Batman would be pretty cool.

293
00:25:45,051 --> 00:25:45,652
[SPEAKER_25]: Batman would be cool.

294
00:25:45,672 --> 00:25:47,172
[SPEAKER_25]: They're throwing him out in the chat room now.

295
00:25:47,432 --> 00:25:48,573
[SPEAKER_25]: We got the chat room up here live.

296
00:25:48,953 --> 00:25:51,054
[SPEAKER_25]: If you had already joined the chat room, what server are they on?

297
00:25:53,675 --> 00:25:58,076
[SPEAKER_03]: It's otherside.irc.net.

298
00:25:58,116 --> 00:26:05,139
[SPEAKER_03]: Just go to orangelounge.skie.cx and there's a link there to our channel.

299
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:12,582
[SPEAKER_25]: If you want one that's kind of a related TV hip-hop theme to New York undercover, kick-ass intro music, use that.

300
00:26:14,706 --> 00:26:18,308
[SPEAKER_22]: WKRP MASH

301
00:26:46,170 --> 00:27:04,255
[SPEAKER_18]: Baby, if you've ever wondered, wondered whatever became of me I'm living on the air in Cincinnati, Cincinnati, WKRP Got kinda tired of packing and unpacking, town to town, up and down the dial

302
00:27:17,178 --> 00:27:27,661
[SPEAKER_18]: And that's enough of that.

303
00:27:28,981 --> 00:27:31,102
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, the WKRP in Cincinnati theme.

304
00:27:32,422 --> 00:27:32,782
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

305
00:27:32,982 --> 00:27:35,723
[SPEAKER_03]: I was, I don't know how old I was when that show was on.

306
00:27:35,803 --> 00:27:37,423
[SPEAKER_03]: It was like, there's Shermie.

307
00:27:38,244 --> 00:27:39,244
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, she's back under bed.

308
00:27:40,171 --> 00:27:42,634
[SPEAKER_03]: Jeremy decided there were too many people downstairs and came up here.

309
00:27:43,835 --> 00:27:45,177
[SPEAKER_03]: Saved by the fucking bell.

310
00:27:45,817 --> 00:27:50,503
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, what's-her-face-from-that-show went on to be in Showgirls and show her boobs and her ass to the world.

311
00:27:51,444 --> 00:27:52,285
[SPEAKER_22]: Elizabeth Berkley.

312
00:27:52,958 --> 00:27:54,679
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, so did Tiffany Amber Thiessen.

313
00:27:56,019 --> 00:27:57,340
[SPEAKER_22]: She's stupid, though.

314
00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:00,562
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't know, a bunch of crap.

315
00:28:00,582 --> 00:28:01,782
[SPEAKER_22]: She was on Beverly Hills 90210.

316
00:28:02,883 --> 00:28:04,664
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm sure she got naked at some point.

317
00:28:05,664 --> 00:28:06,084
[SPEAKER_22]: I know.

318
00:28:07,125 --> 00:28:07,585
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm sure.

319
00:28:08,585 --> 00:28:09,366
[SPEAKER_22]: She's a slut.

320
00:28:10,486 --> 00:28:10,746
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah.

321
00:28:11,627 --> 00:28:13,928
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you were on Saved by the Bell, then you'd have to turn into a hoe.

322
00:28:14,248 --> 00:28:15,949
[SPEAKER_03]: You know Kim Fields was in a Bell Biff DeVoe video?

323
00:28:19,022 --> 00:28:19,623
[SPEAKER_22]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

324
00:28:38,059 --> 00:28:39,340
[SPEAKER_22]: And she's a slut in that one, too.

325
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:49,486
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean, she's willing to, like, have sex with, or she, you know, and you can tell that the character, it went through her mind that, you know, she was going to have sex with this, like, 16-year-old kid.

326
00:28:50,247 --> 00:28:52,908
[SPEAKER_22]: So, you know, she was a slut in that, too.

327
00:28:53,028 --> 00:28:54,329
[SPEAKER_22]: So, I don't know.

328
00:28:54,790 --> 00:28:55,370
[SPEAKER_22]: But she sucked.

329
00:28:57,291 --> 00:28:58,892
[SPEAKER_22]: Elizabeth, uh, Berkley.

330
00:28:59,352 --> 00:29:01,774
[SPEAKER_22]: She's played everything she's been, she's been like a slut.

331
00:29:02,659 --> 00:29:10,784
[SPEAKER_25]: Dude, okay, now, I admit she was hot back in the day on Saved by the Bell, okay, long way, you know, she was alright looking, even though she was, I don't know if she was brown or blonde back then, she was okay.

332
00:29:11,465 --> 00:29:15,267
[SPEAKER_25]: The thing that turned me off to Elizabeth Berkley was the pool scene in Showgirl.

333
00:29:15,327 --> 00:29:20,451
[SPEAKER_25]: Some of you remember this, I swear to God the woman was having a seizure because the light went bad in the freaking pool.

334
00:29:20,951 --> 00:29:22,833
[SPEAKER_25]: What the hell happened?

335
00:29:23,053 --> 00:29:26,275
[SPEAKER_25]: I've had, you know, I've been in bed a little bit.

336
00:29:26,295 --> 00:29:29,198
[SPEAKER_25]: I have not seen anybody have an orgasm like that.

337
00:29:29,238 --> 00:29:32,580
[SPEAKER_25]: If you have an orgasm like that, put a message out in the chat room.

338
00:29:32,781 --> 00:29:33,902
[SPEAKER_25]: That was scary.

339
00:29:34,022 --> 00:29:35,403
[SPEAKER_25]: I was afraid she was having a heart attack.

340
00:29:35,463 --> 00:29:36,323
[SPEAKER_25]: I don't know what the hell happened.

341
00:29:37,364 --> 00:29:41,828
[SPEAKER_22]: She looked like a fucking shark grabbed onto his nuts, like, just thrashing in the water.

342
00:29:42,548 --> 00:29:43,329
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't know, it was weird.

343
00:29:44,390 --> 00:29:46,692
[SPEAKER_26]: Oh my god, what the hell's going on?

344
00:29:46,972 --> 00:29:48,193
[SPEAKER_26]: What the hell was wrong with her?

345
00:29:48,914 --> 00:29:49,314
[SPEAKER_26]: God!

346
00:29:50,492 --> 00:29:52,736
[SPEAKER_22]: You fucked him without fucking him!

347
00:29:53,437 --> 00:29:53,878
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay.

348
00:29:54,318 --> 00:29:56,362
[SPEAKER_22]: You kind of have to fuck them in order to fuck them.

349
00:29:56,903 --> 00:29:58,766
[SPEAKER_22]: But if you weren't fucking them, how were you fucking them?

350
00:30:01,550 --> 00:30:02,932
[SPEAKER_03]: Last week on Orange Lounge Radio.

351
00:30:05,542 --> 00:30:06,883
[SPEAKER_22]: That whole movie is awful.

352
00:30:07,744 --> 00:30:09,765
[SPEAKER_22]: Every time I've watched it, I've fallen asleep.

353
00:30:10,586 --> 00:30:12,087
[SPEAKER_25]: Actually, scarier scene.

354
00:30:12,287 --> 00:30:13,188
[SPEAKER_25]: I just saw this movie.

355
00:30:13,768 --> 00:30:17,611
[SPEAKER_25]: I was watching it over at... Whose house was I just over at the other day, watching this?

356
00:30:18,111 --> 00:30:18,512
[SPEAKER_25]: Tony's.

357
00:30:18,652 --> 00:30:19,432
[SPEAKER_25]: My good friend Tony.

358
00:30:19,993 --> 00:30:21,474
[SPEAKER_25]: Kuno126, what's up to him?

359
00:30:22,275 --> 00:30:24,016
[SPEAKER_25]: Techie guy, represents Otaku Outpost.

360
00:30:24,396 --> 00:30:27,438
[SPEAKER_25]: We saw this movie, Yi Tu Mama Tamien.

361
00:30:27,518 --> 00:30:28,239
[SPEAKER_25]: Okay, you've seen this!

362
00:30:28,919 --> 00:30:30,801
[SPEAKER_25]: Okay, there's a scene in the movie!

363
00:30:30,821 --> 00:30:30,901
[SPEAKER_25]: Okay!

364
00:30:31,607 --> 00:30:33,049
[SPEAKER_25]: Two guys who are pretty close friends, right?

365
00:30:33,349 --> 00:30:35,451
[SPEAKER_25]: The movie gets wackier, so I still suggest you go out and see it.

366
00:30:36,973 --> 00:30:40,657
[SPEAKER_25]: One of their parents, okay, one of the kids is kind of rich, the other one's kind of poor, but this will get down.

367
00:30:40,677 --> 00:30:42,199
[SPEAKER_25]: I think the other kind of poor kid's middle class.

368
00:30:42,259 --> 00:30:43,860
[SPEAKER_25]: Anyway, they're at a country club.

369
00:30:44,361 --> 00:30:45,082
[SPEAKER_25]: You know this scene.

370
00:30:45,322 --> 00:30:46,123
[SPEAKER_25]: They're at a country club.

371
00:30:47,064 --> 00:30:51,589
[SPEAKER_25]: They're on two opposite diving boards talking while they're, you know, fapping.

372
00:30:52,907 --> 00:30:55,548
[SPEAKER_25]: And it gets scarier because they go to a shot.

373
00:30:55,588 --> 00:30:59,249
[SPEAKER_25]: It's bad enough that you see them fapping on the two diving boards at this country club in public.

374
00:30:59,769 --> 00:31:03,570
[SPEAKER_25]: But the killer scene is when you see the spooge hit the water.

375
00:31:04,430 --> 00:31:05,891
[SPEAKER_26]: They put this scene in the movie.

376
00:31:06,311 --> 00:31:06,751
[SPEAKER_26]: Why?

377
00:31:07,051 --> 00:31:08,831
[SPEAKER_26]: I didn't want to see the spooge hit the water.

378
00:31:09,952 --> 00:31:10,992
[SPEAKER_26]: That's just not cool.

379
00:31:12,512 --> 00:31:13,973
[SPEAKER_03]: You're tuned in to KTMI.

380
00:31:14,713 --> 00:31:15,753
[SPEAKER_03]: Too much information radio.

381
00:31:17,254 --> 00:31:19,694
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, there was also the other scene where they started making out, too.

382
00:31:19,714 --> 00:31:22,135
[SPEAKER_22]: The two guys started making out when they were with the one chick.

383
00:31:22,714 --> 00:31:23,435
[SPEAKER_03]: I want that movie.

384
00:31:23,655 --> 00:31:24,715
[SPEAKER_03]: I like seeing guys make out.

385
00:31:25,056 --> 00:31:26,236
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you're saying?

386
00:31:28,018 --> 00:31:30,459
[SPEAKER_25]: I don't have a single problem with guys making out.

387
00:31:30,479 --> 00:31:35,703
[SPEAKER_25]: If a guy's cute enough, I'd probably make out with him, but... Okay, two guys making out, that's one thing.

388
00:31:36,163 --> 00:31:42,187
[SPEAKER_25]: But at that point in the movie, we didn't need to see, you know, they pretty much had it established they were pretty homophobic.

389
00:31:42,488 --> 00:31:44,649
[SPEAKER_25]: We did not need to see the spooge hit the water.

390
00:31:46,991 --> 00:31:47,971
[SPEAKER_25]: Melody's in here now.

391
00:31:48,032 --> 00:31:48,572
[SPEAKER_25]: Say hi, Melody.

392
00:31:49,858 --> 00:31:52,920
[SPEAKER_25]: And she just paused because she just came in as I said that, and now she's kind of shook.

393
00:31:55,921 --> 00:32:03,185
[SPEAKER_03]: Perhaps we should get back to 2DX and Beatmania and everything, right?

394
00:32:03,746 --> 00:32:07,288
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just having the image, that's mental image that I did not need.

395
00:32:07,928 --> 00:32:08,148
[SPEAKER_03]: Here.

396
00:32:09,689 --> 00:32:11,750
[SPEAKER_22]: I saw the whole movie, I just got bored with it too.

397
00:32:11,770 --> 00:32:12,891
[SPEAKER_22]: I was like, ah, it's foreign.

398
00:32:14,913 --> 00:32:15,173
[SPEAKER_25]: Oh, man.

399
00:32:35,336 --> 00:32:36,618
[SPEAKER_22]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

400
00:32:52,610 --> 00:32:55,291
[SPEAKER_25]: We haven't had out anything besides Eurobeat songs on DDR.

401
00:32:55,312 --> 00:32:57,953
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm still waiting to find a machine that has the club mixes on it.

402
00:32:58,913 --> 00:33:02,215
[SPEAKER_25]: And, you know, I'd really like for them to open up the code to that, although I don't think they will.

403
00:33:02,275 --> 00:33:04,356
[SPEAKER_25]: It'd be kind of cool if I could make my own DDR mix.

404
00:33:05,716 --> 00:33:07,897
[SPEAKER_25]: There's tons of songs on there, but hey, you know, that's why.

405
00:33:08,017 --> 00:33:13,160
[SPEAKER_25]: But I'm glad that there's nothing going on, because nothing going on means people are playing rather than starting drama, and that's a beautiful thing.

406
00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:16,061
[SPEAKER_25]: Because that means that there's less stupid people that I have to slap.

407
00:33:17,302 --> 00:33:19,703
[SPEAKER_22]: Actually, we're in the process of finding the code right now.

408
00:33:20,259 --> 00:33:22,420
[SPEAKER_22]: We have people working on it night and day.

409
00:33:23,721 --> 00:33:24,961
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, doing that kind of thing.

410
00:33:25,021 --> 00:33:28,443
[SPEAKER_22]: Actually, I'm getting closer and closer to being able to rip more stuff out of there.

411
00:33:28,463 --> 00:33:33,025
[SPEAKER_22]: I just got a thing to rip videos out of PlayStation 2 Bomani games.

412
00:33:33,045 --> 00:33:37,667
[SPEAKER_22]: The problem is the program is Japanese, so I have no fucking clue what it wants me to do.

413
00:33:38,907 --> 00:33:39,888
[SPEAKER_22]: Is this a fuck you show?

414
00:33:41,148 --> 00:33:42,269
[SPEAKER_29]: No, this is a real show.

415
00:33:43,158 --> 00:33:44,458
[SPEAKER_25]: Oh, darn.

416
00:33:44,478 --> 00:33:45,519
[SPEAKER_29]: We're going to do the Fikus later.

417
00:33:45,979 --> 00:33:49,260
[SPEAKER_25]: Okay, I'll save it for then because I don't want to mess up anything.

418
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:52,261
[SPEAKER_25]: DarkSakura was cruising a really cool place.com.

419
00:33:52,281 --> 00:33:54,462
[SPEAKER_25]: My boy Government went to that.

420
00:33:54,822 --> 00:34:00,184
[SPEAKER_25]: I met him shortly after the destruction at MGL thanks to Changeo, Phoenix, and a bunch of other crazy MFs.

421
00:34:00,864 --> 00:34:03,185
[SPEAKER_25]: So go to that site, bmox.com, if you haven't already went there.

422
00:34:03,205 --> 00:34:04,445
[SPEAKER_25]: Actually, I think Phoenix is doing...

423
00:34:05,277 --> 00:34:29,651
[SPEAKER_22]: information gathering and news for them now too, really cool guy down in LA what's up to him and JustJay, Envision, other heads down there, Supply, Jobson, whatever the hell he is well it looks like, as far as new stuff coming out it looks like Guitar Freak's 9th and Drum Mania 8th are supposed to be coming out next month you're going to have Beat Mania 7th and the final coming out to Playstation 2

424
00:34:30,894 --> 00:34:33,779
[SPEAKER_25]: So is that Beatmania 7th the final mix for Beatmania?

425
00:34:33,820 --> 00:34:36,424
[SPEAKER_25]: So I'm assuming that everything is going to be stepped up to 2DX after that?

426
00:34:38,454 --> 00:34:41,615
[SPEAKER_22]: Um, yeah, it's pretty much, it's the final and, um, segment.

427
00:34:41,995 --> 00:34:43,255
[SPEAKER_22]: Hello, I totally forgot.

428
00:34:43,736 --> 00:34:47,217
[SPEAKER_22]: Another, um, DDR Extreme code was released this week.

429
00:34:47,937 --> 00:34:51,578
[SPEAKER_22]: Um, unlocking a couple more non-stop courses and more Oni courses.

430
00:34:52,058 --> 00:34:59,220
[SPEAKER_22]: Including in those, um, Oni courses, they've got, you know, Sakura as one of the playable songs in one of the Oni courses.

431
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:02,521
[SPEAKER_22]: Along with, um, let's see what else, Xenon is in one of them.

432
00:35:03,181 --> 00:35:05,804
[SPEAKER_22]: and Dance Dance Revolution is in one of them.

433
00:35:06,124 --> 00:35:10,568
[SPEAKER_22]: And finally, in one of the non-subcourses, Heaven is... What was it?

434
00:35:12,109 --> 00:35:12,389
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah.

435
00:35:13,030 --> 00:35:16,293
[SPEAKER_22]: Heaven is 57 gray or... I forget the fucking song.

436
00:35:17,882 --> 00:35:23,466
[SPEAKER_25]: Honestly, if you are looking, I don't know how many heads haven't wanted to play it.

437
00:35:23,606 --> 00:35:26,728
[SPEAKER_25]: If you haven't had a chance to play it yet, please go out and play Guitar Freaks.

438
00:35:26,788 --> 00:35:28,949
[SPEAKER_25]: It's an excellent game, and I feel it's kind of been slept on.

439
00:35:28,969 --> 00:35:38,335
[SPEAKER_25]: There are a few people, you know, most people don't go beyond DDR and I'd say Beatmania, but if you have to expand to another element, definitely go with Guitar Freaks.

440
00:35:38,395 --> 00:35:39,996
[SPEAKER_25]: It's one of the most fun games I've had.

441
00:35:40,316 --> 00:35:41,777
[SPEAKER_25]: Dance Mania X is another fun one.

442
00:35:41,817 --> 00:35:45,159
[SPEAKER_25]: Islander just mentioned that, but Guitar Freaks is one of my favorites.

443
00:35:45,699 --> 00:35:58,563
[SPEAKER_25]: And then later, earlier this week, I got to play more Cusar, because that was fun.

444
00:36:00,744 --> 00:36:01,144
[SPEAKER_29]: Same place?

445
00:36:02,345 --> 00:36:03,145
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, same place.

446
00:36:03,265 --> 00:36:05,246
[SPEAKER_22]: Played on the fifth mix in Max 2 again.

447
00:36:05,586 --> 00:36:07,286
[SPEAKER_22]: That fifth mix is fucked up.

448
00:36:08,107 --> 00:36:08,567
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh my god.

449
00:36:09,327 --> 00:36:10,768
[SPEAKER_22]: It's just, all the pads don't work.

450
00:36:11,408 --> 00:36:11,748
[SPEAKER_22]: That's it.

451
00:36:12,890 --> 00:36:20,332
[SPEAKER_25]: Nothing sucks more than when you go to an arcade and you've already dealt with somebody who's been talking to a gang of shit, and you can't kick their ass because the machine sucks.

452
00:36:22,833 --> 00:36:23,133
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah.

453
00:36:23,633 --> 00:36:24,033
[SPEAKER_22]: What's that?

454
00:36:27,794 --> 00:36:28,034
[SPEAKER_03]: Yay.

455
00:36:28,415 --> 00:36:28,675
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

456
00:36:29,435 --> 00:36:35,096
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, guys, I'm really sorry, and thank you so much for bearing with me on this.

457
00:36:35,217 --> 00:36:36,777
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to go ahead and get... Oh, here, you talk.

458
00:36:37,981 --> 00:36:39,082
[SPEAKER_22]: Don't bear with us.

459
00:36:39,663 --> 00:36:42,045
[SPEAKER_22]: You're privileged to be listening to us.

460
00:36:42,826 --> 00:36:46,810
[SPEAKER_22]: You will deal with any hardships that you... Yeah.

461
00:36:47,611 --> 00:36:47,951
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah.

462
00:36:48,452 --> 00:36:48,892
[SPEAKER_03]: Give me that.

463
00:36:49,273 --> 00:36:50,734
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, I'm going to a break.

464
00:39:15,913 --> 00:39:19,645
You're a New York City boy, so young, so wild, in a New York City

465
00:43:43,599 --> 00:44:00,434
[SPEAKER_11]: That's right, Joey Strick joined one Before there were words, communication was done through feet Body language is controlled by rhythm Music is the universal league Feel this, feel these, uh

00:47:16,138 --> 00:47:18,661
[SPEAKER_07]: Because Bongo demands it.

475
00:47:21,324 --> 00:47:22,185
[SPEAKER_03]: Yay, we're back.

476
00:47:23,106 --> 00:47:25,548
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm on drink number four, which is more of that chocolate.

477
00:47:26,669 --> 00:47:29,372
[SPEAKER_03]: It's vanilla soy milk and Godiva liqueur.

478
00:47:29,853 --> 00:47:30,593
[SPEAKER_03]: How is it, Melody?

479
00:47:32,756 --> 00:47:33,957
[SPEAKER_28]: It's gone now.

480
00:47:34,077 --> 00:47:34,978
[SPEAKER_28]: I already drank it.

481
00:47:35,058 --> 00:47:36,520
[SPEAKER_28]: It's really yummy, actually.

482
00:47:37,438 --> 00:47:53,466
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm about to work on that drink myself, I'm working through a mixture of apple juice and sky vodka right now, so it's good, it's good stuff, I already had two with amp in it, so I'm getting kind of, oh wait, she's sampling the drink now, I'm getting kind of bent, we just came from a terrific, what was the name of the sushi spot we went to?

483
00:47:55,827 --> 00:47:58,348
[SPEAKER_28]: Dang, that is good, that's a really yummy drink.

484
00:47:59,989 --> 00:48:00,449
[SPEAKER_26]: Ross!

485
00:48:02,611 --> 00:48:03,011
[SPEAKER_25]: Fuck!

486
00:48:03,171 --> 00:48:05,372
[SPEAKER_25]: Alright, we don't know, no, the other one.

487
00:48:07,415 --> 00:48:32,915
[SPEAKER_25]: Toonari, if you're ever in Sacramento, go to Toonari Sushi, good stuff Right by DarkSakura's house, you can come be on Orange Lounge Radio too, if you're cool Um, we're all drinking except for our designated host Yeah, I'm staying sober, so I can be boring I gotta, you know, I have to be the dull end of the show Loki, I mean, are you straight or anything, Loki?

488
00:48:32,935 --> 00:48:34,216
[SPEAKER_25]: Do you drink normally or what's going on?

489
00:48:35,117 --> 00:48:35,978
[SPEAKER_22]: No, I don't drink normally

490
00:48:37,344 --> 00:48:38,344
[SPEAKER_25]: Any particular reason?

491
00:48:39,865 --> 00:48:42,465
[SPEAKER_22]: Because I think I'll probably get violent and hurt people.

492
00:48:44,145 --> 00:48:45,406
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah, that's cool.

493
00:48:45,586 --> 00:48:46,466
[SPEAKER_25]: Angry drunks suck.

494
00:48:46,506 --> 00:48:47,306
[SPEAKER_25]: I've only experienced two.

495
00:48:47,326 --> 00:48:48,766
[SPEAKER_25]: Don't come around me if you're an angry drunk.

496
00:48:49,687 --> 00:48:53,127
[SPEAKER_03]: What we need to do is get you entirely shit-faced and take you to Golf Land.

497
00:48:55,528 --> 00:48:56,188
[SPEAKER_25]: Well, actually, no.

498
00:48:56,208 --> 00:48:58,329
[SPEAKER_25]: We don't want to get him shit-faced and take him to a strip bar.

499
00:48:58,389 --> 00:48:59,289
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah, Golf Land would be good.

500
00:49:00,349 --> 00:49:02,689
[SPEAKER_03]: So he can murder all the silly, stupid Roosevelt children.

501
00:49:04,270 --> 00:49:05,170
[SPEAKER_22]: Get video of that.

502
00:49:07,072 --> 00:49:08,973
[SPEAKER_03]: I would pay money to see that.

503
00:49:12,315 --> 00:49:13,696
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, Mongo Child does rock.

504
00:49:14,757 --> 00:49:18,199
[SPEAKER_03]: Melody and I have had Mongo Child two days in a row at the same place in Roseville.

505
00:49:19,099 --> 00:49:20,260
[SPEAKER_03]: At Great Wall in Roseville.

506
00:49:20,600 --> 00:49:22,582
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, hi, say hi.

507
00:49:23,302 --> 00:49:23,622
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi.

508
00:49:24,443 --> 00:49:25,443
[SPEAKER_03]: This is Iguana Girl.

509
00:49:25,463 --> 00:49:26,584
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my god, wee!

510
00:49:27,364 --> 00:49:28,525
[SPEAKER_03]: She's been playing Animal Crack.

511
00:49:32,007 --> 00:49:34,849
[SPEAKER_03]: She's another one of our designated people.

512
00:49:37,319 --> 00:49:58,475
[SPEAKER_25]: because the rest of us are well on our way I can stop playing the game as soon as I pay off another 500,000 bells I'm waiting for the first report in the news from Animal Crossing that somebody ran into somebody on accident or had a speeding violation because they were waiting to get home to do something in Animal Crossing

513
00:49:59,491 --> 00:50:08,338
[SPEAKER_28]: Well, I have actually seen spots on the road that are like potholes or whatever that look like the little star in Animal Crossing, and the first thing that crossed my mind was, I need to get my shovel and dig it up.

514
00:50:09,418 --> 00:50:11,320
[SPEAKER_25]: There's a serious addiction problem here.

515
00:50:11,340 --> 00:50:13,802
[SPEAKER_25]: We're trying to get Melody and Jessica into a 12-step.

516
00:50:14,542 --> 00:50:17,224
[SPEAKER_25]: We're working on that, but we haven't managed to do it today.

517
00:50:19,145 --> 00:50:19,466
[SPEAKER_22]: You see?

518
00:50:21,716 --> 00:50:37,451
[SPEAKER_22]: Now, I almost, you know, I used to be like, no, I actually never really was like that, but, you know, sure, I'd want to get back, you know, so I could do shit on Animal Crossing, but that was until I learned about the wonders of turning back the internal clock, into which case you could play days before and that kind of fun stuff.

519
00:50:38,372 --> 00:50:44,238
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm on the LiveJournal Animal Crossing community, and one person will actually refer to that as clock fondling.

520
00:50:45,059 --> 00:50:46,020
[SPEAKER_28]: Greatest term ever.

521
00:50:47,464 --> 00:50:49,066
[SPEAKER_25]: See, here's my problem with Animal Crossing.

522
00:50:49,346 --> 00:50:51,128
[SPEAKER_25]: There's not enough violence in the damn game.

523
00:50:51,448 --> 00:50:53,030
[SPEAKER_25]: For example, Tom Nook.

524
00:50:53,150 --> 00:50:56,473
[SPEAKER_25]: That son of a bitch needs to get a bullet right between the eyes for how rude he is.

525
00:50:56,774 --> 00:50:57,795
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm sick of that shit.

526
00:50:58,175 --> 00:51:04,201
[SPEAKER_25]: Every time I've seen somebody go to that goddamn store, that asshole sits there, okay, oh, you want to come into my store?

527
00:51:04,721 --> 00:51:09,186
[SPEAKER_25]: You need to be able to snatch him from behind the counter and beat his ass in that game for being an asshole.

528
00:51:09,566 --> 00:51:10,127
[SPEAKER_25]: Sick of this.

529
00:51:11,548 --> 00:51:14,650
[SPEAKER_22]: He's like a little Chinese woman that's running the store.

530
00:51:15,251 --> 00:51:15,431
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh!

531
00:51:16,492 --> 00:51:16,652
Oh!

532
00:51:16,832 --> 00:51:17,653
[SPEAKER_22]: You want product?

533
00:51:17,713 --> 00:51:18,333
[SPEAKER_22]: You want product?

534
00:51:18,713 --> 00:51:22,116
[SPEAKER_22]: And then you go upstairs and there's like two and it's like, oh my god!

535
00:51:22,136 --> 00:51:23,297
[SPEAKER_22]: He spit two!

536
00:51:25,038 --> 00:51:25,979
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay, that was dirty.

537
00:51:26,579 --> 00:51:27,319
[SPEAKER_25]: That was dirty.

538
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:28,640
[SPEAKER_25]: But that's the truth, man.

539
00:51:28,660 --> 00:51:29,481
[SPEAKER_25]: You need a punch button.

540
00:51:29,501 --> 00:51:35,345
[SPEAKER_25]: See, if it was GTA 3 Vice City, somebody pisses you off, you pull a shotgun out and fucking erase their ass.

541
00:51:35,365 --> 00:51:38,387
[SPEAKER_25]: In Animal Crossing, you gotta run around because it's one of those happy Nintendo games.

542
00:51:38,748 --> 00:51:39,268
[SPEAKER_25]: Screw this!

543
00:51:39,508 --> 00:51:40,009
[SPEAKER_25]: I want Animal...

544
00:51:40,970 --> 00:51:42,110
[SPEAKER_28]: You just hit them with a bug net.

545
00:51:42,190 --> 00:51:42,871
[SPEAKER_28]: There you go.

546
00:51:42,931 --> 00:51:46,472
[SPEAKER_25]: I wanna have an Animal Crossing where you can just hit somebody in the head with a fucking bat.

547
00:51:47,172 --> 00:51:49,572
[SPEAKER_25]: Animal Crossing 3, the carnage begins.

548
00:51:49,832 --> 00:51:50,653
[SPEAKER_25]: That's what I want.

549
00:51:50,693 --> 00:51:52,073
[SPEAKER_25]: Nintendo, make the game.

550
00:51:54,574 --> 00:51:56,134
[SPEAKER_25]: Okay, Jessica didn't wanna say anything.

551
00:51:56,434 --> 00:51:58,855
[SPEAKER_25]: But I say more violence in Animal Crossing.

552
00:51:59,135 --> 00:51:59,835
[SPEAKER_25]: That's what I want.

553
00:51:59,915 --> 00:52:01,556
[SPEAKER_25]: I want shovels to the back of the head.

554
00:52:01,936 --> 00:52:02,896
[SPEAKER_25]: I want hatchets.

555
00:52:03,176 --> 00:52:04,056
[SPEAKER_25]: I want meat cleavers.

556
00:52:04,076 --> 00:52:04,777
[SPEAKER_25]: That's what I want.

557
00:52:05,397 --> 00:52:06,077
[SPEAKER_29]: I have to pee.

558
00:52:07,711 --> 00:52:14,378
[SPEAKER_22]: No, what I don't understand is, okay, the store carries four types of paper, and no Nintendo games.

559
00:52:14,658 --> 00:52:15,899
[SPEAKER_22]: What the hell is up with that?

560
00:52:16,420 --> 00:52:17,260
[SPEAKER_25]: See, that's some other shit.

561
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:20,243
[SPEAKER_25]: Fuck that game because it doesn't have all the best Nintendo games of all time.

562
00:52:20,544 --> 00:52:23,466
[SPEAKER_25]: Where's my goddamn copy of River City Ransom and Animal Crossing?

563
00:52:23,506 --> 00:52:26,770
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah, it's not Nintendo proprietary, but I don't give a fuck.

564
00:52:26,990 --> 00:52:27,951
[SPEAKER_25]: That game was the shit.

565
00:52:30,323 --> 00:52:32,285
[SPEAKER_24]: I just want to hit someone's upside the head with a shovel.

566
00:52:32,406 --> 00:52:33,047
[SPEAKER_24]: That's right.

567
00:52:33,607 --> 00:52:34,168
That's right.

568
00:52:34,208 --> 00:52:34,649
[SPEAKER_25]: That's right.

569
00:52:34,669 --> 00:52:36,872
[SPEAKER_25]: Hear the ping noise of a toddler's head in the Robin's store.

570
00:52:37,172 --> 00:52:38,034
[SPEAKER_25]: Fuck that bastard.

571
00:52:39,594 --> 00:52:45,438
[SPEAKER_22]: That and those stupid twins, and they sell like the stupidest shit, I mean like the, what was it, floating asteroid?

572
00:52:45,739 --> 00:52:48,020
[SPEAKER_22]: What the hell do I need a floating asteroid for my house for?

573
00:52:48,601 --> 00:52:50,302
[SPEAKER_26]: Plus, you know who else I'm gonna bust the cap in?

574
00:52:50,542 --> 00:52:54,525
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm gonna personally stab in the eye at stupid bitch Phyllis at the motherfucking post office.

575
00:52:54,886 --> 00:52:57,127
[SPEAKER_26]: I don't give a fuck if you're a postal worker, you rude bitch.

576
00:52:57,387 --> 00:53:02,331
[SPEAKER_26]: I'll come in there and strangle you at night, and then dance on your fucking corpse like Marishnikov, you dumb bitch.

577
00:53:02,611 --> 00:53:04,253
[SPEAKER_26]: Every single time I'm gonna fucking go see...

578
00:53:04,953 --> 00:53:11,875
[SPEAKER_26]: Every single time a motherfucker goes in there, another customer, FUCK YOU, YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO DO YOUR GODDAMN JOB, YOU STUPID BITCH, DIE!

579
00:53:13,276 --> 00:53:14,836
[SPEAKER_26]: Rose doesn't want the goddamn mic.

580
00:53:16,197 --> 00:53:17,617
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm too busy laughing.

581
00:53:18,918 --> 00:53:20,158
[SPEAKER_26]: I'll stab that bitch in the eye.

582
00:53:21,716 --> 00:53:22,096
[SPEAKER_22]: What was it?

583
00:53:22,256 --> 00:53:22,537
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay.

584
00:53:23,537 --> 00:53:23,958
[SPEAKER_22]: I saw this.

585
00:53:24,118 --> 00:53:25,719
[SPEAKER_22]: There's one animal in our town, Lucy.

586
00:53:25,779 --> 00:53:27,780
[SPEAKER_22]: She has the backyard theme in her house.

587
00:53:28,340 --> 00:53:29,001
[SPEAKER_22]: What the fuck?

588
00:53:29,241 --> 00:53:31,302
[SPEAKER_22]: Why make your house look like your backyard?

589
00:53:31,883 --> 00:53:32,723
[SPEAKER_22]: That's the dumbest thing.

590
00:53:32,923 --> 00:53:34,064
[SPEAKER_22]: I want to live in my backyard.

591
00:53:34,724 --> 00:53:35,945
[SPEAKER_22]: Because you're a fucking retard.

592
00:53:36,245 --> 00:53:36,746
[SPEAKER_25]: Another thing.

593
00:53:37,006 --> 00:53:40,988
[SPEAKER_25]: Iguana Girl, perfectly peaceful player, was going around today doing errands around people.

594
00:53:41,309 --> 00:53:42,429
[SPEAKER_25]: What was the name of that dumb bitch?

595
00:53:43,390 --> 00:53:44,751
[SPEAKER_25]: Start with a P. Ears.

596
00:53:45,856 --> 00:53:46,236
[SPEAKER_26]: Pippi!

597
00:53:46,676 --> 00:53:48,197
[SPEAKER_26]: That dumb bitch needs to die, too!

598
00:53:48,437 --> 00:53:50,518
[SPEAKER_26]: She went up to her and just asked a simple question, do you have any jobs?

599
00:53:50,758 --> 00:53:54,279
[SPEAKER_26]: Well, no, I actually don't, and I'm gonna take some of your shit, because you can't do anything about it!

600
00:53:55,159 --> 00:53:55,460
[SPEAKER_26]: No!

601
00:53:55,680 --> 00:53:57,280
[SPEAKER_26]: Hit her in the head with a fucking shovel!

602
00:53:57,760 --> 00:53:58,501
[SPEAKER_26]: I want debt!

603
00:53:59,901 --> 00:54:06,744
[SPEAKER_28]: Now, back on the entire theme of weird houses, I don't remember who it is, but someone has a freaking bathroom.

604
00:54:07,084 --> 00:54:11,625
[SPEAKER_28]: There's a bunch of exotic screens and toilets behind them all, and a plant and a garbage can.

605
00:54:11,705 --> 00:54:12,986
[SPEAKER_28]: It's a freaking bathroom!

606
00:54:13,346 --> 00:54:14,667
[SPEAKER_28]: That's what I want in my house.

607
00:54:15,087 --> 00:54:16,367
[SPEAKER_28]: Make it a public toilet.

608
00:54:17,128 --> 00:54:18,088
[SPEAKER_28]: Greatest room ever.

609
00:54:18,748 --> 00:54:22,110
[SPEAKER_25]: Because the greatest thing you can have in your house in Animal Crossing is a porta potty.

610
00:54:23,910 --> 00:54:25,451
[SPEAKER_22]: You know, we're missing The Simpsons.

611
00:54:25,871 --> 00:54:27,152
[SPEAKER_22]: The 300th episode.

612
00:54:29,653 --> 00:54:30,093
[SPEAKER_22]: No cable.

613
00:54:31,129 --> 00:54:41,491
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want the bathroom theme in your house, by the way, all you need is six toilets, the exotic screen, the exotic wall, the plaza tile, the trash can, and I think a cone.

614
00:54:42,172 --> 00:54:43,572
[SPEAKER_03]: And a plant.

615
00:54:43,712 --> 00:54:45,672
[SPEAKER_03]: And sadly enough, I remember what each of the items are.

616
00:54:46,673 --> 00:54:52,714
[SPEAKER_25]: Because I really want to relive the experience of going to San Francisco and trying to find a public bathroom to use after getting drunk, you know?

617
00:54:53,294 --> 00:54:56,555
[SPEAKER_25]: Nothing sticks out to me like trying to walk over the feces on the floor.

618
00:54:57,355 --> 00:55:00,336
[SPEAKER_25]: And, you know, I really want that public bathroom theme in there.

619
00:55:00,356 --> 00:55:00,656
[SPEAKER_25]: What the heck?

620
00:55:02,376 --> 00:55:03,377
[SPEAKER_25]: Ross is still done.

621
00:55:04,457 --> 00:55:05,858
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't have a fireplace, by the way.

622
00:55:09,180 --> 00:55:10,301
[SPEAKER_03]: He's holding Charmander.

623
00:55:10,701 --> 00:55:11,482
[SPEAKER_03]: Char!

624
00:55:11,802 --> 00:55:12,442
[SPEAKER_03]: Char!

625
00:55:13,143 --> 00:55:20,467
[SPEAKER_03]: Speaking of Pokemon, by the way, I'm going to be playing something for everybody.

626
00:55:21,248 --> 00:55:22,068
[SPEAKER_03]: Hold on for a second.

627
00:55:22,108 --> 00:55:23,449
[SPEAKER_03]: Josh, talk to everybody for a minute.

628
00:55:24,130 --> 00:55:24,850
[SPEAKER_25]: What do you want me to do?

629
00:55:26,311 --> 00:55:29,312
[SPEAKER_25]: Okay, um, okay, well, hey.

630
00:55:29,972 --> 00:55:31,813
[SPEAKER_25]: What was, they thought it was funny, I think.

631
00:55:31,853 --> 00:55:33,654
[SPEAKER_25]: I wonder if everybody in the chat room thought it was funny.

632
00:55:34,254 --> 00:55:34,634
[SPEAKER_25]: I don't know.

633
00:55:34,954 --> 00:55:38,676
[SPEAKER_25]: Uh, regardless, uh, DarkSakura's loading up a sea of goodness for you guys.

634
00:55:38,916 --> 00:55:39,616
[SPEAKER_25]: Ross is chilling here.

635
00:55:39,636 --> 00:55:41,117
[SPEAKER_25]: We're throwing around a Charmander.

636
00:55:41,397 --> 00:55:43,458
[SPEAKER_25]: Squirrel's personally my favorite Pokemon, even though I don't like it.

637
00:55:44,718 --> 00:55:47,379
[SPEAKER_25]: Okay, Charmander was molesting Melody's boob.

638
00:55:48,020 --> 00:55:51,441
[SPEAKER_25]: Mel's gonna have to beat the Charmanders, and now the Charmander's giving Ross head.

639
00:55:53,786 --> 00:55:58,009
[SPEAKER_25]: It's working it like Mariah Carey trying to go for a second record contract at Sony right now.

640
00:55:59,751 --> 00:56:04,534
[SPEAKER_03]: Speaking of Pokemon, I've been collecting a CD series called Pada Pada Max.

641
00:56:05,955 --> 00:56:07,556
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the Japanese Pokemon theme.

642
00:56:08,297 --> 00:56:10,098
[SPEAKER_26]: It ain't the Easter Bunny, motherfucker!

643
00:56:10,739 --> 00:56:12,660
[SPEAKER_03]: From the Pada Pada Max 3 CD.

644
00:56:13,381 --> 00:56:16,043
[SPEAKER_03]: So enjoy the Eurobeat Pokemon groove.

645
00:56:17,384 --> 00:56:19,265
[SPEAKER_03]: Animal Crossing Mookie Bar my ass.

646
00:56:19,966 --> 00:56:20,106
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

647
00:58:02,699 --> 00:58:03,500
[SPEAKER_13]: Oops!

648
00:58:03,600 --> 00:58:03,840
[SPEAKER_13]: My bad!

649
00:58:03,960 --> 00:58:04,000
[SPEAKER_13]: Um...

650
00:58:32,583 --> 00:58:34,745
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we have our Eurobeat hater in here.

651
00:58:36,966 --> 00:58:37,867
[SPEAKER_22]: Yay, it's over!

652
00:58:38,007 --> 00:58:39,368
[SPEAKER_22]: It's Pokemon and Eurobeat.

653
00:58:39,408 --> 00:58:40,189
[SPEAKER_22]: It's like evil.

654
00:58:41,770 --> 00:58:42,150
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't know.

655
00:58:43,491 --> 00:58:45,093
[SPEAKER_22]: I was able to ignore the whole song.

656
00:58:45,473 --> 00:58:46,073
[SPEAKER_22]: That was great.

657
00:58:48,856 --> 00:58:49,876
[SPEAKER_22]: Yay, Digimon.

658
00:58:51,317 --> 00:58:59,364
[SPEAKER_22]: Worst remix ever has to be the, uh, that, what was it, uh, uh, AM, what was it?

659
00:59:00,794 --> 00:59:01,074
[SPEAKER_22]: A.M.

660
00:59:01,154 --> 00:59:02,415
[SPEAKER_22]: Groove 2001.

661
00:59:02,756 --> 00:59:04,597
[SPEAKER_22]: Holy shit, awful remix.

662
00:59:05,258 --> 00:59:05,758
[SPEAKER_22]: Awful remix.

663
00:59:05,778 --> 00:59:09,321
[SPEAKER_22]: Probably just like that Legend of Max 300 Unlimited crap.

664
00:59:09,741 --> 00:59:11,703
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, no, Legend of Max Unlimited 300.

665
00:59:12,844 --> 00:59:15,566
[SPEAKER_22]: Stupid friggin' sim file.

666
00:59:16,127 --> 00:59:18,989
[SPEAKER_22]: In fact, you can't even download it because the URL is broken.

667
00:59:21,371 --> 00:59:23,753
[SPEAKER_03]: As soon as my CD is friggin' recognized, there we go.

668
00:59:23,773 --> 00:59:23,813
[SPEAKER_03]: Um...

669
00:59:27,600 --> 00:59:33,068
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'm gonna play something that if you've seen any of the Japanese Digimon, you'll recognize.

670
00:59:33,289 --> 00:59:34,150
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a short track.

671
00:59:34,871 --> 00:59:35,692
[SPEAKER_03]: So, here you go.

672
00:59:37,575 --> 00:59:38,156
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, eventually.

673
00:59:50,293 --> 00:59:52,355
Lalalala lalalala lalalala

674
01:00:34,444 --> 01:00:36,026
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you for watching.

675
01:00:36,046 --> 01:00:37,127
[SPEAKER_14]: See you next time.

676
01:01:01,138 --> 01:01:03,301
[SPEAKER_14]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

677
01:01:37,711 --> 01:01:39,111
[SPEAKER_03]: There, was that better than Pokemon?

678
01:01:39,631 --> 01:01:40,191
[SPEAKER_03]: Yay!

679
01:01:40,652 --> 01:01:42,592
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we're gonna, we should go to our fav- Pokemon!

680
01:01:43,172 --> 01:01:43,552
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

681
01:01:44,012 --> 01:01:47,653
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we should go to our favorite part of the show, the fuckies of the week!

682
01:01:48,033 --> 01:01:49,313
[SPEAKER_03]: Yay!

683
01:01:49,473 --> 01:01:52,434
[SPEAKER_11]: Yay!

684
01:01:53,254 --> 01:01:54,194
[SPEAKER_03]: The fuckies of the week.

685
01:01:54,634 --> 01:01:56,415
[SPEAKER_03]: Here, I usually explain to you, it's your turn.

686
01:01:58,375 --> 01:01:59,835
[SPEAKER_22]: This is where we get ranty.

687
01:02:00,415 --> 01:02:02,976
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh wait, this is just another part of the show.

688
01:02:03,726 --> 01:02:13,412
[SPEAKER_22]: This is where every week we take time to do a shout out to all those people that piss us off and all the things that inconvenience us because we're better than everyone else.

689
01:02:15,574 --> 01:02:16,154
[SPEAKER_22]: That's about it.

690
01:02:17,975 --> 01:02:32,425
[SPEAKER_03]: So, because, again, I can't play music in the background, we're going to go to a brief break so all of you can PM me, yes, private message, or you can email orangechallengeradio at yahoo.com and tell us about what pisses you off.

691
01:02:33,078 --> 01:02:42,063
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want to say fuck you to somebody, but you're too much of a wuss to do it yourself, tell us, and we'll say it for you, because we don't give a fuck.

692
01:02:42,403 --> 01:02:53,910
[SPEAKER_03]: We're just going to go ahead and play some of our usual fuck you theme songs, and then we'll come back and be angsty.

693
01:02:54,270 --> 01:02:54,671
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah.

694
01:06:00,073 --> 01:06:00,626
Thanks for watching!

695
01:07:41,109 --> 01:07:45,791
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, that was our music for Fuck You's of the Week.

696
01:07:46,131 --> 01:07:50,773
[SPEAKER_13]: We'll go ahead and start with Loki for our angstiness.

697
01:08:08,900 --> 01:08:11,301
[SPEAKER_22]: Alright, I'm so thrown off without music.

698
01:08:13,702 --> 01:08:14,002
[SPEAKER_22]: No.

699
01:08:15,722 --> 01:08:16,342
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, God.

700
01:08:16,363 --> 01:08:26,986
[SPEAKER_22]: Uh, no, see, um, I really only have, I don't have, I think I had FUs earlier this week, but, like, I've just been bored over the weekend, so I kind of forgot it.

701
01:08:27,286 --> 01:08:28,587
[SPEAKER_22]: Anyways, I have two.

702
01:08:29,227 --> 01:08:31,027
[SPEAKER_22]: Um, start off with LessAnxiety1.

703
01:08:31,347 --> 01:08:35,629
[SPEAKER_22]: Um, FU to Acid3.0 for constantly crashing on me.

704
01:08:36,649 --> 01:08:41,751
[SPEAKER_22]: and at least I'm smart enough to save every now and then, but the thing keeps freezing up on me and that sucks.

705
01:08:42,391 --> 01:08:43,732
[SPEAKER_22]: So, yeah, F you to that.

706
01:08:43,972 --> 01:08:49,674
[SPEAKER_22]: And, uh, F you to freaking stupid old people with the handicap license plates, okay?

707
01:08:49,714 --> 01:09:00,218
[SPEAKER_22]: Just because you're fucking crippled because you got shot in the ass in Vietnam or whatever, you don't need to be driving 30 miles an hour slower than everyone else and you take up the closed parking spaces and you walk slow and you suck.

708
01:09:02,566 --> 01:09:10,552
[SPEAKER_22]: So, you know, I think what should actually happen is, because, you know, a lot of these people with handicapped bumper stickers, you know, I see, they're not hobbling enough.

709
01:09:10,933 --> 01:09:18,619
[SPEAKER_22]: I just want to take, you know, their fucking wheelchair and just like, you know, go over the back of their spine with it, you know, just, you know, make sure that they're crippled just enough.

710
01:09:18,999 --> 01:09:24,683
[SPEAKER_22]: Because, what the hell, okay, if you're really crippled and you're driving a car, that's like driving a car blind.

711
01:09:24,884 --> 01:09:26,685
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean, I don't know.

712
01:09:27,666 --> 01:09:31,729
[SPEAKER_22]: I hate old people and I hate them with the stupid, yeah, stickers.

713
01:09:32,634 --> 01:09:35,956
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't like the people who are not handicapped and have handicapped stickers.

714
01:09:37,356 --> 01:09:41,538
[SPEAKER_03]: Who just have them, or like borrow some family members just so they can get a front parking spot.

715
01:09:42,839 --> 01:09:43,359
[SPEAKER_03]: That would work.

716
01:09:43,879 --> 01:09:46,020
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, is that your fuck you's of the week?

717
01:09:46,040 --> 01:09:46,260
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

718
01:09:49,201 --> 01:09:50,522
[SPEAKER_25]: Ah shit, they passed it to me.

719
01:09:51,403 --> 01:09:56,429
[SPEAKER_25]: Alright, first of all, fuck you to everybody who's involved in like the mainstream hip-hop community right now.

720
01:09:56,750 --> 01:10:01,635
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm sick of all you bastards who put out a fucking song and then put it out six months later as a goddamn remix.

721
01:10:01,715 --> 01:10:04,779
[SPEAKER_25]: I don't care if Mariah Carey's singing on it, it sucks dick anyway.

722
01:10:05,099 --> 01:10:11,467
[SPEAKER_25]: You fooboo-clad, stereotypical motherfuckers can almost suck my motherfucking, I'll battle you for your fucking title, dick.

723
01:10:11,827 --> 01:10:24,791
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm sick of all this shit, you motherfuckers talk shit all over MTV, every five minutes, will not freestyle, battle anybody worth a shit, and I'll go on record and say this, 50 Cent sounds like Mike Tyson with Down Syndrome, but he's supposed to be the hot sack out there?

724
01:10:25,171 --> 01:10:25,731
[SPEAKER_25]: Fuck you!

725
01:10:26,091 --> 01:10:38,535
[SPEAKER_25]: All these motherfuckers in the underground who've tried year after year after year to get put on, can't get put on because all of you fucking cock-sucking bastards up at MTV won't put on anything except for Real World and anything that'll get a fucking fashion brand out there.

726
01:10:38,835 --> 01:10:40,375
[SPEAKER_25]: Fuck all you fascist bitches.

727
01:10:40,655 --> 01:10:47,337
[SPEAKER_25]: Fuck all the goddamn stupid ass students at my fucking school who will not listen to me when they're in class and sit in the back of the class and don't do shit.

728
01:10:47,637 --> 01:10:50,257
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm sitting there, I give you 13 pages of notes to pass the test.

729
01:10:50,557 --> 01:10:51,758
[SPEAKER_25]: You can't even read that shit.

730
01:10:51,798 --> 01:10:55,358
[SPEAKER_25]: Learn something besides all the members of B2K, you stupid motherfuckers.

731
01:10:55,798 --> 01:11:04,180
[SPEAKER_25]: Fuck the president of North Korea because this dumbass shouldn't be building nuclear weapons when he can't spell blockbuster even though he has a fucking collection the size of a small state.

732
01:11:04,820 --> 01:11:07,664
[SPEAKER_25]: Um, motherfucker, everybody in Oakland is fucking stereotypical.

733
01:11:07,945 --> 01:11:13,532
[SPEAKER_25]: Motherfuck all the wannabe gangbangers in Fremont and Haywood who don't have anything better to do than try to be wannabe gangbangers.

734
01:11:14,153 --> 01:11:16,717
[SPEAKER_25]: Um, I don't know about everything out there, but I'll figure out some shit.

735
01:11:16,797 --> 01:11:17,938
[SPEAKER_25]: Fuck all y'all motherfuckers.

736
01:11:21,102 --> 01:11:21,763
[SPEAKER_22]: Say that again.

737
01:11:22,572 --> 01:11:30,982
[SPEAKER_22]: There was a line that I heard from, it was from Clone High, it's all, he's talking to like the dark organization or whatever, like these people that want him to clone people.

738
01:11:31,302 --> 01:11:33,705
[SPEAKER_22]: Anyways, he's all, so we should go to the Olive Garden.

739
01:11:33,805 --> 01:11:37,229
[SPEAKER_22]: It's like eating in a giant kitchen of an Italian cliché.

740
01:11:39,591 --> 01:11:40,152
[SPEAKER_13]: That's great.

741
01:11:42,259 --> 01:11:45,084
[SPEAKER_26]: and motherfuck Taco Bell because they don't use real meat.

742
01:11:45,344 --> 01:11:47,308
[SPEAKER_26]: Del Taco owns you, bitch.

743
01:11:49,031 --> 01:11:50,573
[SPEAKER_22]: And Del Taco makes me feel sick.

744
01:11:51,054 --> 01:11:55,642
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, and F you to the freaking, what was it, that show Hot or Not.

745
01:11:58,243 --> 01:12:02,106
[SPEAKER_22]: You ripped off a fucking website, you're calling it your own, then you fucking botched the whole thing.

746
01:12:02,226 --> 01:12:03,447
[SPEAKER_22]: And who do you have on the show?

747
01:12:03,467 --> 01:12:08,931
[SPEAKER_22]: You have Lorenzo Llamas on there, and he's like saying, I don't like women with fake breasts.

748
01:12:09,091 --> 01:12:13,354
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh wait, I was married to one at one point, but I don't like women with fake breasts.

749
01:12:14,495 --> 01:12:17,217
[SPEAKER_25]: It's like Anna Nicole Smith saying she has good taste in makeup.

750
01:12:21,627 --> 01:12:40,098
[SPEAKER_27]: I'd just like to say a massive fuck you to every single goddamn person who waits until the fucking last minute to buy their Sherry's Berries so that they can get something special for their loved one and they wait until the day of so that they can say, oh, can you deliver this for me today?

751
01:12:40,338 --> 01:12:41,519
[SPEAKER_27]: No, fuck you.

752
01:12:42,259 --> 01:12:43,680
[SPEAKER_27]: We did everything through FedEx.

753
01:12:43,720 --> 01:12:44,961
[SPEAKER_27]: You're too goddamn late.

754
01:12:45,181 --> 01:12:47,182
[SPEAKER_27]: Go to the store and wait in line like everybody else.

755
01:12:47,662 --> 01:12:48,423
[SPEAKER_27]: So fuck you people.

756
01:12:52,954 --> 01:12:54,655
[SPEAKER_28]: I don't really have any right now.

757
01:12:54,715 --> 01:12:56,077
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm too happy and drunk.

758
01:12:58,879 --> 01:13:00,321
[SPEAKER_25]: Hang on, we're seeing if Ross doesn't fuck you.

759
01:13:00,741 --> 01:13:01,602
[SPEAKER_25]: Ross doesn't have a fuck you.

760
01:13:04,164 --> 01:13:05,025
[SPEAKER_25]: I got another fuck you.

761
01:13:05,425 --> 01:13:08,228
[SPEAKER_25]: Fuck Sega for stopping making Dreamcast.

762
01:13:08,728 --> 01:13:10,130
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm not buying another game from you.

763
01:13:10,250 --> 01:13:12,091
[SPEAKER_25]: I'll be burning your shit on the internet happily.

764
01:13:12,352 --> 01:13:15,775
[SPEAKER_25]: I will never pay for another Dreamcast game because you bastards didn't support the system.

765
01:13:16,015 --> 01:13:16,616
[SPEAKER_25]: Kiss my ass.

766
01:13:17,616 --> 01:13:17,937
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually...

767
01:13:19,054 --> 01:13:21,595
[SPEAKER_03]: Sega would not be in existence if they continued to support the system.

768
01:13:21,615 --> 01:13:22,295
[SPEAKER_03]: They would be bankrupt.

769
01:13:22,315 --> 01:13:23,035
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you kidding me?

770
01:13:23,275 --> 01:13:23,995
[SPEAKER_03]: I am not kidding you.

771
01:13:25,015 --> 01:13:25,175
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

772
01:13:25,475 --> 01:13:29,576
[SPEAKER_03]: They stopped producing the Dreamcast and stopped supporting it so that they could stay alive as a company.

773
01:13:29,856 --> 01:13:31,537
[SPEAKER_03]: We would not have any more Sonic Team games.

774
01:13:31,557 --> 01:13:37,278
[SPEAKER_03]: We would not have any new Knights, no new Sonic, no nothing, if they hadn't stopped their production of the Dreamcast.

775
01:13:37,378 --> 01:13:39,238
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought I would just let you know that.

776
01:13:39,878 --> 01:13:40,918
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you retract your fuck you now?

777
01:13:41,199 --> 01:13:41,499
[SPEAKER_25]: Yes.

778
01:13:41,879 --> 01:13:42,399
[SPEAKER_25]: Yes, I do.

779
01:13:42,459 --> 01:13:43,319
[SPEAKER_25]: That still sucks, though.

780
01:13:44,520 --> 01:13:49,944
[SPEAKER_22]: and F you to the stupid people on eBay who I'm buying the freaking Mystery Science Theater 3000 movies for.

781
01:13:50,004 --> 01:13:55,028
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay, listen, I'm buying 46 movies for about, eh, it's going about $52 right now.

782
01:13:55,608 --> 01:13:58,670
[SPEAKER_22]: Stop emailing me, you people, that I'm not bidding on your auctions.

783
01:13:58,970 --> 01:14:00,732
[SPEAKER_22]: They're trying to sell me movies for $5 a piece.

784
01:14:00,832 --> 01:14:06,616
[SPEAKER_22]: Listen, I'm buying taped movies because I can't, I already own all the ones that are legit, okay?

785
01:14:06,756 --> 01:14:08,557
[SPEAKER_22]: Don't try to sell me legit shit.

786
01:14:08,697 --> 01:14:09,278
[SPEAKER_22]: I already own it.

787
01:14:10,358 --> 01:14:12,160
[SPEAKER_25]: Fuck you to you, stupid ass.

788
01:14:13,366 --> 01:14:17,027
[SPEAKER_25]: AIDS-infected cocksucking motherfuckers who spam email people.

789
01:14:17,367 --> 01:14:26,810
[SPEAKER_25]: I get sick of going to my goddamn account and having to delete 135 messages because you guys can't stop telling me about ink cartridges and penis enlargement programs.

790
01:14:27,130 --> 01:14:29,311
[SPEAKER_25]: Look, if my dick was small, your wife wouldn't like it.

791
01:14:29,351 --> 01:14:30,451
[SPEAKER_25]: Quit fucking emailing me.

792
01:14:33,055 --> 01:14:42,444
[SPEAKER_27]: Just a side note on that one, does anybody ever notice that the females always get the ones for the dick enlargements, and the guys always get the ones for the boob enlargements?

793
01:14:42,825 --> 01:14:47,910
[SPEAKER_28]: Exactly, I think I just deleted something out of my box today, it's all Tealshark39, enhance your penis naturally.

794
01:14:47,930 --> 01:14:51,634
[SPEAKER_28]: I was like, wow, if I'm enhancing my penis, I've got a lot of issues right there.

795
01:14:52,754 --> 01:14:58,681
[SPEAKER_25]: I swear there was one guy who actually did an interview where he stated that he was happy spamming because he got paid.

796
01:14:58,941 --> 01:15:04,327
[SPEAKER_25]: If I see you on the street, I'm going to stomp your motherfucking nutsack and then I'm going to drop an elbow on your fucking nose and kill you.

797
01:15:04,588 --> 01:15:05,509
[SPEAKER_25]: DarkSakura's in the bathroom.

798
01:15:05,529 --> 01:15:06,370
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm going to give it to Loki.

799
01:15:07,890 --> 01:15:10,652
[SPEAKER_22]: and just so you know, spammers, I am happy with my breast size.

800
01:15:11,133 --> 01:15:15,277
[SPEAKER_22]: So stop sending me emails.

801
01:15:15,777 --> 01:15:19,321
[SPEAKER_22]: And like all the weird ones, like they send you, you just won this, you just won that.

802
01:15:19,801 --> 01:15:30,172
[SPEAKER_22]: And what's funny is all the websites that I go on to, I use different names, so they'll send me like, hey Bob Bob, you just won da da da.

803
01:15:30,888 --> 01:15:32,249
[SPEAKER_25]: You know what you're going to win if I find you?

804
01:15:32,269 --> 01:15:33,610
[SPEAKER_25]: A fucking hatchet to the head.

805
01:15:33,971 --> 01:15:34,511
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm sick of this.

806
01:15:34,611 --> 01:15:40,736
[SPEAKER_25]: Every five seconds, live nude girls getting fucked by horses in the ass while they're being, you know, blown by a fucking seal.

807
01:15:41,056 --> 01:15:42,097
[SPEAKER_25]: I don't want to see this shit.

808
01:15:42,437 --> 01:15:45,540
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm into some kinky shit, but I'm not into live nude girls being fucked by horses.

809
01:15:45,900 --> 01:15:47,481
[SPEAKER_25]: Quit mailing me this shit in my email.

810
01:15:47,501 --> 01:15:48,122
[SPEAKER_25]: I get sick of it.

811
01:15:48,142 --> 01:15:49,563
[SPEAKER_25]: I got to delete like 50 messages.

812
01:15:49,603 --> 01:15:50,524
[SPEAKER_25]: Want to see live nude girls?

813
01:15:50,684 --> 01:15:52,025
[SPEAKER_25]: No, you want to see live nude girls.

814
01:15:52,265 --> 01:15:56,889
[SPEAKER_25]: You're a 400-pound man sitting off in a goddamn room who hasn't seen a fucking pussy ever since you were born.

815
01:15:57,189 --> 01:15:58,170
[SPEAKER_25]: Leave me the fuck alone.

816
01:15:59,591 --> 01:16:02,233
[SPEAKER_27]: I've got another FU, and I think this is one that Rob would be proud of.

817
01:16:02,673 --> 01:16:13,261
[SPEAKER_27]: I'd like to say a massive FU for whoever the associates were at Fox that decided to freaking get rid of Frenchie, the only goddamn talent that they've ever had.

818
01:16:14,582 --> 01:16:20,327
[SPEAKER_26]: We can't have her on the show because American Idol has so much dignity, and she worked on a porn site.

819
01:16:20,367 --> 01:16:22,468
[SPEAKER_26]: Half of you are looking at it right now.

820
01:16:23,649 --> 01:16:25,791
[SPEAKER_28]: Back to the spam thing.

821
01:16:26,011 --> 01:16:28,713
[SPEAKER_28]: The best spam I have ever received, I actually kept.

822
01:16:29,326 --> 01:16:29,826
[SPEAKER_28]: Hello.

823
01:16:30,386 --> 01:16:32,967
[SPEAKER_28]: If you are a time traveler, I'm going to need the following.

824
01:16:33,567 --> 01:16:40,128
[SPEAKER_28]: One, a modified mind-warping dimensional warp generator number 524350A series wristwatch with memory adapter.

825
01:16:40,448 --> 01:16:45,289
[SPEAKER_28]: Two, reliable carbon-based or silicon-based time-transducing capacitor.

826
01:16:45,649 --> 01:16:46,770
[SPEAKER_28]: I need a reliable source.

827
01:16:46,870 --> 01:16:48,490
[SPEAKER_28]: Please only reply if you're reliable.

828
01:16:48,710 --> 01:16:50,911
[SPEAKER_28]: Send a separate email to me at and give an address.

829
01:16:51,391 --> 01:16:52,771
[SPEAKER_28]: What the hell?

830
01:16:53,621 --> 01:16:54,722
[SPEAKER_25]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, Loki,

831
01:17:13,775 --> 01:17:17,116
[SPEAKER_22]: I check my email about eight times a day because of so much spam and it's in there.

832
01:17:17,136 --> 01:17:21,478
[SPEAKER_22]: I have to go and clean it out because I have a limited mailbox that I can have mail in.

833
01:17:22,438 --> 01:17:31,221
[SPEAKER_22]: But I have to say, I think I mentioned this a couple weeks back, the most creative email I've ever gotten trying to get my personal information was they sent this email from an actual legit...

834
01:17:32,521 --> 01:17:33,842
[SPEAKER_22]: Yahoo Service in India.

835
01:17:52,867 --> 01:17:54,247
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah, there's something I'm comfortable with.

836
01:17:54,267 --> 01:17:57,288
[SPEAKER_25]: Sending out my personal information over the internet to somebody that I don't know.

837
01:17:57,648 --> 01:18:02,389
[SPEAKER_25]: Oh yeah, fuck you to Japanese pornographers who put those fucking little mosaics over all the good stuff.

838
01:18:02,449 --> 01:18:03,369
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm sick of that shit.

839
01:18:04,109 --> 01:18:04,929
[SPEAKER_03]: That's actually a law.

840
01:18:05,889 --> 01:18:08,510
[SPEAKER_03]: It's still a law, so they have to do it to sell their porn.

841
01:18:09,170 --> 01:18:10,770
[SPEAKER_25]: I want to see Anna O'Hearn naked.

842
01:18:11,690 --> 01:18:13,671
[SPEAKER_03]: I can show you Final Fuck X later.

843
01:18:13,691 --> 01:18:16,931
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, my turn.

844
01:18:22,398 --> 01:18:25,920
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you to alcohol for making me have to pee all the time.

845
01:18:27,981 --> 01:18:29,502
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you again to the spammers.

846
01:18:29,822 --> 01:18:33,024
[SPEAKER_03]: But see, I only have two active emails that I use.

847
01:18:33,064 --> 01:18:36,605
[SPEAKER_03]: All the rest of my AOL names are blocked from the internet, but DarkSakura.com was left open.

848
01:18:36,625 --> 01:18:40,167
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually do have the site, but anyway.

849
01:18:40,487 --> 01:18:44,970
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura at AOL.com is now blocked from everybody, except for the chosen few.

850
01:18:45,410 --> 01:18:46,610
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, the chosen few.

851
01:18:47,071 --> 01:18:47,751
[SPEAKER_03]: Delete few.

852
01:18:47,831 --> 01:18:50,392
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you want to be among them, you can ask me, and I might say no.

853
01:18:51,133 --> 01:18:51,193
[SPEAKER_03]: Um...

854
01:18:52,709 --> 01:18:54,410
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm not telling you my other one, hell no.

855
01:18:56,512 --> 01:19:01,575
[SPEAKER_03]: But my other one has to do with this stupid dumbass who walked out behind my car today.

856
01:19:01,635 --> 01:19:02,455
[SPEAKER_03]: I nearly ran him over.

857
01:19:02,896 --> 01:19:03,276
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know what?

858
01:19:03,336 --> 01:19:04,176
[SPEAKER_03]: I wish I had.

859
01:19:04,697 --> 01:19:07,278
[SPEAKER_03]: Because the world would have been better without him in the gene pool.

860
01:19:09,620 --> 01:19:17,585
[SPEAKER_22]: Fuck you goes to... He's like the little kid's pee or log floating in the gene pool.

861
01:19:18,826 --> 01:19:20,827
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, he is the feces of the gene pool.

862
01:19:22,870 --> 01:19:27,636
[SPEAKER_03]: My other fuck you of the week goes to my Beatmania 2DX controller.

863
01:19:28,457 --> 01:19:33,944
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, normally when you have sticky keys on your 2DX controller, it's either going to be your first or your 7 key, am I right?

864
01:19:35,165 --> 01:19:35,566
[SPEAKER_03]: Typically.

865
01:19:36,427 --> 01:19:37,769
[SPEAKER_03]: My sticky key is my 4 key!

866
01:19:38,684 --> 01:19:41,948
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, the top middle purple key, or blue, or whatever color it is.

867
01:19:42,448 --> 01:19:43,009
[SPEAKER_03]: It sticks.

868
01:19:43,770 --> 01:19:49,176
[SPEAKER_03]: It really makes it hard to try to pass R5, because you have that one key that's like the center key.

869
01:19:49,777 --> 01:19:54,082
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I come really close to passing a 7.

870
01:19:54,903 --> 01:19:55,203
[SPEAKER_03]: And then...

871
01:19:56,644 --> 01:19:57,265
[SPEAKER_03]: That sticky key.

872
01:19:57,545 --> 01:19:57,905
[SPEAKER_03]: Ruined it.

873
01:19:58,326 --> 01:20:04,710
[SPEAKER_03]: Which, by the way, also, fuck you goes toward, um, not Don't Look Back, because that's not in 8th style.

01:20:04,790 --> 01:20:05,471
[SPEAKER_03]: What's that song?

875
01:20:06,751 --> 01:20:07,812
[SPEAKER_03]: Please don't go.

876
01:20:09,453 --> 01:20:11,475
[SPEAKER_03]: I had a 78% on that first time.

01:20:14,757 --> 01:20:16,958
[SPEAKER_03]: So, fuck you to the chat room.

[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, Jahi is going to read the fuck you's from the chatroom, but I'm just saying fuck you to please don't go because I had a 78% on that.

880
01:20:25,465 --> 01:20:26,746
[SPEAKER_03]: And by the way, I was not playing it easy.

881
01:20:27,987 --> 01:20:29,488
[SPEAKER_03]: So, um... Why are you looking at me?

882
01:20:29,808 --> 01:20:30,288
[SPEAKER_03]: Because!

01:20:31,129 --> 01:20:34,171
[SPEAKER_03]: I want you... You think I'm going to deny you the 7?

884
01:20:34,211 --> 01:20:34,611
[SPEAKER_03]: You're not.

885
01:20:35,712 --> 01:20:35,912
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

01:23:17,747 --> 01:23:18,267
[SPEAKER_03]: You're tired.

930
01:23:22,353 --> 01:23:24,214
[SPEAKER_03]: Would you like to say something enlightening to the chatroom?

931
01:23:25,955 --> 01:23:28,497
[SPEAKER_27]: I really, really, really, really hate Sherry's Berries.

932
01:23:30,498 --> 01:23:32,439
[SPEAKER_03]: You heard it here on Orange Child Radio.

933
01:23:32,819 --> 01:23:33,740
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll alert the media.

934

[SPEAKER_22]: Me too.

936
01:23:36,702 --> 01:23:39,143
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't like chocolate-covered anything except ice cream.

937
01:23:41,704 --> 01:23:46,347
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you still want your bowl of ice cream and wetty rip and your two women...

938
01:23:48,413 --> 01:23:50,455
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, that's like ice cream.

939
01:23:51,215 --> 01:23:52,457
[SPEAKER_22]: It's Asian ice cream.

940
01:23:53,477 --> 01:23:53,938
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh yeah.

941
01:23:55,379 --> 01:23:56,600
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we should go to a break.

942
01:23:56,760 --> 01:23:57,801
[SPEAKER_03]: Who agrees with me?

943
01:23:59,062 --> 01:24:02,725
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, half of our people have already gone downstairs to watch the Ron Jeremy movie.

949
01:24:47,680 --> 01:24:49,061
[SPEAKER_03]: Although you've probably already heard these.

[SPEAKER_03]: We're back live!

975
01:37:31,989 --> 01:37:34,710
[SPEAKER_03]: That was a series of long versions.

976
01:37:35,110 --> 01:37:40,473
[SPEAKER_03]: The first one that we had was Enflo with Flojack, Mr. Drunk Remix.

977
01:37:42,150 --> 01:37:45,573
[SPEAKER_03]: Judy and Mary with Silbacassu, which, yeah, the English version was in DDR.

978
01:37:46,134 --> 01:37:50,298
[SPEAKER_03]: And then Gacked with Another World, a song that made it into Guitar Freak's seventh fix.

979
01:37:51,639 --> 01:37:52,860
[SPEAKER_03]: God, he's hot, isn't he?

980
01:37:54,121 --> 01:37:56,323
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, you want to tell us about the movie that everyone downstairs is watching?

981
01:37:57,784 --> 01:38:00,967
[SPEAKER_22]: They're watching Pornstar, The Legend of Ron Jeremy.

982
01:38:01,307 --> 01:38:06,552
[SPEAKER_22]: It's a documentary about Ron Jeremy, the most famous male porn star in the industry.

983
01:38:07,722 --> 01:38:12,723
[SPEAKER_25]: See, here's what's scary about the porn industry, and I read this from an article, actually, about another famous porn star.

984
01:38:12,763 --> 01:38:15,124
[SPEAKER_25]: His name slips my mind.

985
01:38:15,564 --> 01:38:16,164
[SPEAKER_25]: He's done a lot.

986
01:38:16,304 --> 01:38:16,744
[SPEAKER_25]: Rocco.

987
01:38:16,905 --> 01:38:18,585
[SPEAKER_25]: Rocco Cifredi, I think his name is.

988
01:38:19,065 --> 01:38:33,329
[SPEAKER_25]: The guy stated the fact that everybody in the porn industry has a case of herpes, and, you know, you may be looking at Jenna Jameson or Asia Carrera at home, but you have to consider the fact that they might have, like, more diseases than Nicole Smith has lawsuits over that old guy, so it's kind of scary.

989
01:38:34,821 --> 01:38:42,147
[SPEAKER_22]: Actually, Ron Jeremy said that he's only come down with, what was it, The Crabs and something else one time, but that was before he got in the industry.

990
01:38:42,167 --> 01:38:44,769
[SPEAKER_22]: He's been 21 years in the industry, and he's been clean the whole time.

991
01:38:46,010 --> 01:38:47,831
[SPEAKER_22]: Wow, he must have been getting some decent chicks in.

992
01:38:47,891 --> 01:38:48,652
[SPEAKER_25]: I mean, I'd be scared.

993
01:38:48,992 --> 01:38:51,854
[SPEAKER_25]: I mean, you know, you think about it, like, you hear about, like, gangbangs and stuff.

994
01:38:52,154 --> 01:38:52,815
[SPEAKER_25]: Who was the last?

995
01:38:52,975 --> 01:38:53,495
[SPEAKER_25]: Jasmine St.

996
01:38:53,555 --> 01:38:56,498
[SPEAKER_25]: Clair, and there was some other chick, Houston, I think her name was.

997
01:38:57,198 --> 01:38:59,200
[SPEAKER_25]: They go through, like, 500 guys.

998
01:38:59,940 --> 01:39:00,681
[SPEAKER_25]: That's scary.

999
01:39:00,701 --> 01:39:03,383
[SPEAKER_25]: You'd have to back a Ryder truck into that to catch a feeling.

1000
01:39:03,403 --> 01:39:04,444
[SPEAKER_25]: That's, like, ugh.

1001
01:39:06,462 --> 01:39:07,503
[SPEAKER_22]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1002
01:39:29,656 --> 01:39:29,956
[SPEAKER_25]: DarkSakura.com

1003
01:39:51,874 --> 01:39:52,575
[SPEAKER_25]: We need more of that.

1004
01:39:52,595 --> 01:39:59,884
[SPEAKER_25]: We need more women who are open about that sort of thing to actually get out there and talk to guys and completely shatter that whole stereotype.

1005
01:40:00,405 --> 01:40:02,448
[SPEAKER_25]: Because I think it would make things a lot easier on guys.

1006
01:40:02,488 --> 01:40:05,312
[SPEAKER_25]: Plus you'd let them know if they were in the friend zone a lot easier and that would help.

1007
01:40:06,974 --> 01:40:09,076
[SPEAKER_22]: Nothing's hotter than a woman coming on to you.

1008
01:40:12,188 --> 01:40:13,129
[SPEAKER_25]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1009
01:40:25,856 --> 01:40:26,376
[SPEAKER_22]: Not really.

1010
01:40:26,617 --> 01:40:28,438
[SPEAKER_22]: Let's see, more stuff about Ron Jeremy.

1011
01:40:28,918 --> 01:40:31,540
[SPEAKER_22]: His penis is 9 inches 3 quarters.

1012
01:40:32,420 --> 01:40:33,721
[SPEAKER_22]: He can give himself head.

1013
01:40:34,822 --> 01:40:38,184
[SPEAKER_22]: He's been in the industry 21 years, been clean ever since.

1014
01:40:40,045 --> 01:40:43,888
[SPEAKER_22]: He's... I don't know, let me think here.

1015
01:40:43,908 --> 01:40:45,369
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't know.

1016
01:40:46,770 --> 01:40:47,630
[SPEAKER_25]: He's cool in orgasmo.

1017
01:40:49,091 --> 01:40:51,353
[SPEAKER_25]: Orgasmo is a pimp-ass movie if you haven't seen it.

1018
01:40:53,155 --> 01:40:56,458
[SPEAKER_25]: I don't know, maybe some of the women can respond to this in the chatroom too if there are any in there.

1019
01:40:56,938 --> 01:41:02,703
[SPEAKER_25]: I've heard that women only like between 5 to 7 inches because 9 is painful or something.

1020
01:41:03,184 --> 01:41:06,186
[SPEAKER_25]: I guess I'll make that little survey after DarkSakura gets back.

1021
01:41:06,206 --> 01:41:07,107
[SPEAKER_25]: Let's know about that one.

1022
01:41:07,628 --> 01:41:08,508
[SPEAKER_25]: Wait, she has something to say.

1023
01:41:09,449 --> 01:41:11,211
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, it's time to play Match Game!

1024
01:41:11,771 --> 01:41:13,192
[SPEAKER_03]: Yay!

1025
01:41:13,453 --> 01:41:15,855
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe I won't play Match Game.

1026
01:41:20,221 --> 01:41:30,972
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we don't have our nice porn music playing in the background, so... Yeah, they're all downstairs listening to the... It's the porn groove.

1027
01:41:35,177 --> 01:41:35,477
[SPEAKER_03]: Really?

1028
01:41:35,917 --> 01:41:36,618
[SPEAKER_03]: What was that like?

1029
01:41:38,180 --> 01:41:39,021
[SPEAKER_03]: Here, tell everyone about it.

1030
01:41:40,521 --> 01:41:45,626
[SPEAKER_28]: Apparently he told some director that he could do that, and they're like, you have to do this on film!

1031
01:41:45,666 --> 01:41:50,810
[SPEAKER_28]: And so the next thing they show is him kind of looking around in some really cheesy-ass film.

1032
01:41:51,270 --> 01:41:53,813
[SPEAKER_28]: Next thing you know, he is kissing the tip of his own dick.

1033
01:41:54,373 --> 01:41:58,156
[SPEAKER_28]: It's just like, that's really freaking impressive.

1034
01:41:58,317 --> 01:42:04,182
[SPEAKER_28]: I did not see him giving himself head, I'm sure he could do it, but yeah, they actually showed him kissing himself.

1035
01:42:05,922 --> 01:42:07,563
[SPEAKER_22]: He says he can't really give himself head.

1036
01:42:07,603 --> 01:42:10,465
[SPEAKER_22]: He can just, you know, kind of get... Not anymore?

1037
01:42:11,785 --> 01:42:13,426
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, well, I don't know.

1038
01:42:13,446 --> 01:42:14,607
[SPEAKER_22]: He said he could only get the tip in.

1039
01:42:18,129 --> 01:42:18,950
[SPEAKER_03]: I need to see that.

1040
01:42:20,010 --> 01:42:23,052
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, um, first of all, um, we need our two contestants.

1041
01:42:23,092 --> 01:42:24,193
[SPEAKER_03]: We need one more person from downstairs.

1042
01:42:24,213 --> 01:42:25,273
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you want to recruit somebody for us?

1043
01:42:28,095 --> 01:42:29,956
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so we're having a four-person match game.

1044
01:42:30,756 --> 01:42:34,859
[SPEAKER_03]: Um... Okay, um, chat room.

01:43:02,910 --> 01:43:04,912
[SPEAKER_03]: And no, DarkTattoo, you're wrong.

[SPEAKER_03]: So, um, downstairs, there's a white bag that has a shirt and some pens in it.

1064
01:43:42,952 --> 01:43:44,814
[SPEAKER_02]: Will you grab this, please?

1065
01:43:45,114 --> 01:43:45,875
[SPEAKER_03]: On the left seat.

01:44:01,302 --> 01:44:04,705
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, we're gonna wait for, um, for, uh, Jahi to come back.

1071
01:44:04,805 --> 01:44:09,848
[SPEAKER_03]: In the meantime, I think that I'll, uh, entertain everybody with real porn music!

1072
01:44:10,629 --> 01:44:13,011
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, it's real porn music here on Orange Niles Radio.

1073
01:45:37,637 --> 01:45:39,178
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, enough of the porn music.

1074
01:45:39,859 --> 01:45:44,381
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, we're waiting for Jahi to get out of the bathroom, because he's got to pee, or something.

1075
01:45:44,962 --> 01:45:46,363
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't sink out my bathroom!

1076
01:45:49,064 --> 01:45:50,585
[SPEAKER_03]: He says he's just taking a leak.

1077
01:45:51,886 --> 01:45:57,310
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, well shit, what are we going to do while we're waiting for him so we can... Okay, he's out.

1078
01:45:57,970 --> 01:45:58,811
[SPEAKER_03]: Wash your hands!

1079
01:46:02,413 --> 01:46:03,834
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, we're ready to start this.

1080
01:46:03,914 --> 01:46:04,975
[SPEAKER_03]: Yay!

01:46:04,995 --> 01:46:05,055
[SPEAKER_03]: Yay!

01:46:07,020 --> 01:46:09,601
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's go ahead and get in the mood for a match game.

1083
01:46:12,361 --> 01:46:13,801
Okay, that's enough of that.

1084
01:46:13,881 --> 01:46:16,062
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, the first one for match game, remember...

1085
01:46:35,325 --> 01:46:40,308
[SPEAKER_03]: And remember, for match game, for our guests, you have to fill in the blank.

1086
01:46:40,529 --> 01:46:43,250
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we fill in the blank.

1087
01:46:43,291 --> 01:46:44,852
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you get a match, you get a point.

1088
01:46:44,992 --> 01:46:46,753
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just as easy as that.

1089
01:46:46,953 --> 01:46:48,374
[SPEAKER_03]: So, our first one.

1090
01:46:48,594 --> 01:46:49,255

01:47:11,175 --> 01:47:13,375
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll repeat the question one more time.

1096
01:47:13,735 --> 01:47:19,377
[SPEAKER_03]: After watching his first porn, Freddy the Fapper said that Ron Jeremy was his hero because he could blank.

[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see if... We're gonna see if everybody's ready.

[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, we have answers.

1104
01:48:44,842 --> 01:48:45,202
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1105
01:48:45,802 --> 01:48:48,663
[SPEAKER_03]: EvilNucky2DX says, Give himself head!

1106
01:48:50,203 --> 01:48:52,104
[SPEAKER_03]: EOSFB says, Propel.

1107
01:48:55,862 --> 01:49:00,625
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so, uh, we'll start with me because I'm the best.

1108
01:49:01,085 --> 01:49:08,990
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, after watching his first porn, Freddy the Fapper said that Ron Jeremy was his hero because he could get head while playing Metroid.

1109
01:49:13,573 --> 01:49:16,535
[SPEAKER_22]: Um, he was his, like, uh, yeah.

1110
01:49:17,335 --> 01:49:24,540
[SPEAKER_22]: He liked him because he, Ron Jeremy could have sex with many anonymous women at the same time.

1111
01:49:26,519 --> 01:49:32,081
[SPEAKER_22]: Pleasing with his 9 and 3 quarter inch cock to porn music.

1112
01:49:33,541 --> 01:49:33,741
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah.

1113
01:49:35,842 --> 01:49:44,924
[SPEAKER_25]: Ron Jeremy was his hero because he could buff his own pickle after it came out of the mouth of the woman that he was having sex with because his penis was so big.

1114
01:49:47,005 --> 01:49:50,206
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm boring, I said, because he could suck it.

1115
01:49:53,807 --> 01:49:54,967
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a match!

1116
01:49:57,982 --> 01:50:21,134
[SPEAKER_03]: at one point goes to EvilNauki2DX because Rod Jeremy can suck his own cock I'm feeling silly already well you remember in Clerks the guy broke his neck because he tried to suck his own dick at least he died happy yeah at least he died happy

1117
01:50:23,999 --> 01:50:27,582
[SPEAKER_22]: And eight days a week they had a guy that sprained his neck doing that.

1118
01:50:27,682 --> 01:50:29,503
[SPEAKER_22]: And he's like, yeah, I got it in a little bit.

1119
01:50:30,744 --> 01:50:31,645
[SPEAKER_22]: It tastes like bacon.

1120
01:50:35,568 --> 01:50:38,050
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1121
01:50:38,190 --> 01:50:38,771
[SPEAKER_03]: Next one.

1122
01:50:39,371 --> 01:50:44,295
[SPEAKER_03]: After drinking a whole lot of alcohol, Linda the Lush decided to play DDR while blank.

1123
01:50:45,476 --> 01:50:46,797
[SPEAKER_03]: You give us the answer.

1124
01:50:48,741 --> 01:50:49,921
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I can't sing!

1125
01:51:15,908 --> 01:51:16,749
Thank you for watching!

1126
01:51:47,625 --> 01:51:49,406
[SPEAKER_03]: We're still waiting on Nalki's answer.

1127
01:51:49,466 --> 01:51:50,166
[SPEAKER_03]: All of us are in.

1128
01:51:50,206 --> 01:51:51,227
[SPEAKER_03]: EOSFB is in.

1129
01:51:53,507 --> 01:51:54,808
[SPEAKER_03]: Nalki, give us your answer.

1130
01:51:59,817 --> 01:52:01,719
Actually, you know what I just noticed?

1131
01:52:19,117 --> 01:52:20,958
[SPEAKER_03]: EvilNauki2DX has left our chatroom.

1132
01:52:21,978 --> 01:52:24,059
[SPEAKER_03]: I just noticed.

1133
01:52:25,559 --> 01:52:27,800
[SPEAKER_03]: Are we going to be able to find another contestant in the interim?

1134
01:52:28,260 --> 01:52:30,121
[SPEAKER_03]: Who wants to take Naoki's place?

1135
01:52:30,441 --> 01:52:31,041
[SPEAKER_03]: Or should we wait?

1136
01:52:31,421 --> 01:52:32,161
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, chatroom.

1137
01:52:32,842 --> 01:52:33,962
[SPEAKER_03]: Guys, should we wait for Naoki?

1138
01:52:35,362 --> 01:52:36,323
[SPEAKER_03]: Can we give him a few minutes?

1139
01:52:36,343 --> 01:52:40,644
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll go ahead and take another break.

1140
01:52:40,664 --> 01:52:43,085
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll give him a few minutes to show up.

1141
01:52:44,930 --> 01:52:49,114
[SPEAKER_03]: And if he doesn't show up, then we'll have to find a replacement.

1142
01:52:51,115 --> 01:52:54,298
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably in the interest of fairness, we'll have to go ahead and set his point aside.

1143
01:52:54,378 --> 01:52:59,842
[SPEAKER_03]: So we'll go ahead and play a song or two just to give him some time.

1144
01:52:59,862 --> 01:53:00,483
[SPEAKER_03]: That's fair, right?

1145
01:53:01,704 --> 01:53:02,024
[SPEAKER_03]: One song.

1146
01:53:02,605 --> 01:53:04,226
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll go ahead and pick a song.

1147
01:53:04,326 --> 01:53:04,927
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'll play...

1148
01:53:07,262 --> 01:53:07,782
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

1149
01:53:08,083 --> 01:53:15,367
[SPEAKER_03]: Just to put this in the interest of nice, pornerific music, let me go into my DDR directory here.

1150
01:53:17,428 --> 01:53:27,855
[SPEAKER_03]: And we will play... God, as soon as I can find it... I can't find my song, dammit.

1151
01:53:28,855 --> 01:53:29,636
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll play Doomie!

1152
01:53:30,817 --> 01:53:34,379
[SPEAKER_03]: You have a minute and 21 seconds to get your butt back online.

1153
01:54:58,783 --> 01:55:00,044
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, Nelke's not back.

1154
01:55:00,284 --> 01:55:05,347
[SPEAKER_03]: So, we're going to go ahead and pick the next person in the chat room.

1155
01:55:05,407 --> 01:55:06,988
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll put it to a vote, okay?

1156
01:55:08,749 --> 01:55:11,070
[SPEAKER_03]: Do we want 23 Magus or DarkTetia?

1157
01:55:11,450 --> 01:55:11,710
[SPEAKER_03]: Vote.

1158
01:55:15,253 --> 01:55:16,513
[SPEAKER_03]: Vote, 23 Magus or DarkTetia.

1159
01:55:18,654 --> 01:55:19,815
[SPEAKER_03]: Just, just who do you want?

1160
01:55:20,095 --> 01:55:20,415
[SPEAKER_03]: Pick one.

1161
01:55:22,677 --> 01:55:23,037
[SPEAKER_03]: Who do you want?

1162
01:55:25,616 --> 01:55:30,698
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkTesia, you've been voted in the Deathmatch Arena.

1163
01:55:31,699 --> 01:55:33,640
[SPEAKER_03]: You've been voted onto the island, yes.

1164
01:55:34,341 --> 01:55:42,565
[SPEAKER_03]: So, um, I guess we'll only do, uh, I'll have to think up another one while we're coming up with answers.

1165
01:55:42,865 --> 01:55:44,947
[SPEAKER_03]: If you've got your answer, I'll go ahead and repeat the question.

1166
01:55:45,927 --> 01:55:51,811
[SPEAKER_03]: After watching, I'm sorry, after drinking a whole lot of alcohol, Linda the Lush decided to play DDR while blank.

1170
01:56:02,842 --> 01:56:04,243
[SPEAKER_03]: Go ahead and play more match game music.

1171
01:56:05,143 --> 01:56:07,745
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't make us play more match game music.

1172
01:56:07,865 --> 01:56:08,666
[SPEAKER_03]: Think of your answer.

1173

01:56:12,268 --> 01:56:12,549
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1177
01:56:14,610 --> 01:56:15,050
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

1178
01:56:15,831 --> 01:56:16,131
[SPEAKER_03]: Guys.

1179
01:56:17,252 --> 01:56:17,512
[SPEAKER_03]: Listen.

1180
01:56:17,893 --> 01:56:24,757
[SPEAKER_03]: After drinking a whole lot of alcohol, Linda the Lush decided to play DDR while... And EOSFB says...

1181
01:56:27,463 --> 01:56:28,724
[SPEAKER_03]: while riding a big black cock.

1182
01:56:32,467 --> 01:56:36,590
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkTentia said, DarkTentia said, naked.

1183
01:56:37,451 --> 01:56:39,953
[SPEAKER_03]: Linda Leshud played DDR Wild, naked.

1184
01:56:44,136 --> 01:56:50,741
[SPEAKER_03]: My answer, it was Ruben, Ruben who said the big black cock.

1185
01:56:53,286 --> 01:57:01,192
[SPEAKER_03]: So, my answer was Linda the Luscious had to play DDR while watching Ron Jeremy give himself head.

1186
01:57:02,213 --> 01:57:02,794
[SPEAKER_03]: What is your answer?

1187
01:57:04,275 --> 01:57:06,056
[SPEAKER_22]: She was playing DDR while masturbating.

1188
01:57:07,518 --> 01:57:08,118
[SPEAKER_03]: Not a match.

1189
01:57:08,398 --> 01:57:09,159
[SPEAKER_03]: Jahi, your answer.

1190
01:57:11,020 --> 01:57:11,681
[SPEAKER_25]: Al Qaeda!

1191
01:57:12,021 --> 01:57:12,662
[SPEAKER_25]: Al Qaeda!

1192
01:57:13,022 --> 01:57:13,642
[SPEAKER_25]: Al Qaeda!

1193
01:57:15,644 --> 01:57:16,325
[SPEAKER_03]: Still no match.

1194
01:57:16,805 --> 01:57:17,125
[SPEAKER_03]: Melody?

1195
01:57:19,787 --> 01:57:21,489
[SPEAKER_28]: While screwing Ron Jeremy.

1196
01:57:23,291 --> 01:57:24,591
[SPEAKER_28]: We have no winners!

1197
01:57:24,872 --> 01:57:25,652
[SPEAKER_28]: You lose!

1198
01:57:25,952 --> 01:57:26,772
[SPEAKER_03]: Good day, sir!

1199
01:57:27,092 --> 01:57:28,113
[SPEAKER_13]: You're so stupid!

1200
01:57:28,973 --> 01:57:29,373
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1201
01:57:31,414 --> 01:57:32,254
[SPEAKER_03]: Next question.

1202
01:57:32,914 --> 01:57:33,774
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, everyone listening?

1203
01:57:34,815 --> 01:57:40,056
[SPEAKER_03]: Perry, the perfect attacker, wanted to enter the perfect attack tournament, but he didn't because blank.

1204
01:57:42,777 --> 01:57:44,978
[SPEAKER_03]: He didn't because blank.

1207
01:58:10,635 --> 01:58:11,456
Thanks for watching!

1208
01:58:35,413 --> 01:58:36,194
We have answers in our...

1209
01:58:56,361 --> 01:59:03,886
[SPEAKER_03]: Beautiful guests have replied, or people have replied, so we'll go ahead and repeat the question, or whatever.

1210
01:59:04,506 --> 01:59:07,608
[SPEAKER_03]: Perry, the perfect attacker, wanted to enter the perfect attack tournament because he didn't.

1211
01:59:08,108 --> 01:59:08,789
[SPEAKER_03]: Blank.

1212
01:59:10,410 --> 01:59:12,111
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll go ahead to EOSFB.

1213
01:59:14,112 --> 01:59:16,373
[SPEAKER_03]: His penis wasn't as big as Ron Jeremy's.

1214
01:59:17,834 --> 01:59:19,075
[SPEAKER_03]: What does that have to do with PA?

1215
01:59:19,095 --> 01:59:19,736
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll never know.

1216
01:59:19,756 --> 01:59:22,617
[SPEAKER_03]: Stop talking about Ron Jeremy, Perry!

1217
01:59:22,657 --> 01:59:25,079
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkTestia says, because he was watching porn.

1218
01:59:27,159 --> 01:59:34,346
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, my answer, my answer, because Tigger already entered it and he would have won anyway.

1219
01:59:37,408 --> 01:59:41,772
[SPEAKER_22]: Because it doesn't matter, because if Tigger enters, you're going to lose, so go home and sleep.

1220
01:59:43,053 --> 01:59:43,253
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah.

1221
01:59:45,195 --> 01:59:48,478
[SPEAKER_25]: I said because he was too busy fapping to Anohor Prawn.

1222
01:59:49,399 --> 01:59:50,480
[SPEAKER_25]: She has a really nice ass.

1223
01:59:53,033 --> 01:59:55,134
[SPEAKER_28]: I said because, what did I say?

1224
01:59:55,194 --> 01:59:57,115
[SPEAKER_28]: Because he was watching Ron Jeremy give himself head.

1225
02:00:00,297 --> 02:00:02,458
[SPEAKER_03]: Both of those involve watching porn, right?

1226
02:00:04,459 --> 02:00:06,220
[SPEAKER_03]: He gets a half point for each of those.

1227
02:00:06,640 --> 02:00:09,842
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, DarkSakura is ahead by one point.

1228
02:00:14,925 --> 02:00:17,066
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, next question.

1229
02:00:19,065 --> 02:00:28,793
[SPEAKER_03]: For his birthday, Loki asked for a bowl of ice cream and blank For his birthday, Loki asked for a bowl of ice cream and blank

1230
02:00:45,752 --> 02:00:46,672
Thank you for watching!

1231
02:01:24,588 --> 02:01:26,110
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, we have answers.

1232
02:01:26,670 --> 02:01:30,273
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's go ahead and go to our contestants.

1233
02:01:30,673 --> 02:01:32,335
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, back to the question.

1234
02:01:32,875 --> 02:01:34,317
[SPEAKER_03]: Perry the Perfect Attacker, when does it end?

1235
02:01:34,537 --> 02:01:35,237
[SPEAKER_03]: No, that's the wrong one.

1236
02:01:35,377 --> 02:01:35,718
[SPEAKER_03]: My bad.

1237
02:01:36,531 --> 02:01:39,173
[SPEAKER_03]: For his birthday, Loki asked for a bowl of ice cream and blank.

1238
02:01:40,294 --> 02:01:42,516
[SPEAKER_03]: EOSFB said, Ron Jeremy porn.

1239
02:01:43,977 --> 02:01:45,298
Stop saying that!

1240
02:01:46,338 --> 02:01:47,179
[SPEAKER_22]: Fuckin' A!

1241
02:01:47,559 --> 02:01:48,860
[SPEAKER_22]: Stop talking about Ron Jeremy!

1242
02:01:48,880 --> 02:01:50,281
[SPEAKER_22]: The show isn't about him!

1243
02:01:52,063 --> 02:01:54,985
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, DarkTessia says, Asian midget porn.

1244
02:01:57,130 --> 02:01:59,251
[SPEAKER_22]: The fuck would I want Asian midget porn?

1245
02:01:59,631 --> 02:02:00,992
[SPEAKER_22]: They actually have Asian midgets?

1246
02:02:01,012 --> 02:02:02,133
[SPEAKER_22]: That's what I want to know, man.

1247
02:02:03,273 --> 02:02:04,474
[SPEAKER_22]: How tall do they stand?

1248
02:02:05,775 --> 02:02:06,635
[SPEAKER_03]: Two feet three.

1249
02:02:07,596 --> 02:02:07,916
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1250
02:02:10,637 --> 02:02:14,259
[SPEAKER_03]: For his birthday, Loki asked for a bowl of ice cream and a license to kill idiots.

1251
02:02:16,100 --> 02:02:17,001
[SPEAKER_22]: That's a close second.

1252
02:02:18,381 --> 02:02:18,722
Mine was...

1253
02:02:23,570 --> 02:02:29,316
[SPEAKER_22]: A giant harem full of young Asian schoolgirls, naked and horny, with whipped cream.

1254
02:02:29,616 --> 02:02:30,577
[SPEAKER_22]: Lots of whipped cream.

1255
02:02:31,318 --> 02:02:34,641
[SPEAKER_22]: Actually, you know, now that I mention it, yeah, Asian schoolgirls naked.

1256
02:02:35,201 --> 02:02:40,787
[SPEAKER_22]: And because I can't, you know, obviously I'm seeing someone, but you know, it's a gift, and it'd be wrong for me to refuse a gift.

1257
02:02:43,810 --> 02:02:48,034
[SPEAKER_25]: Man, if you don't need all those schoolgirls, donate to the fucking Chinese schoolgirls fund for real.

1258
02:02:48,815 --> 02:02:51,657
[SPEAKER_25]: But I was going to say a sweet transvestite from Transylvania.

1259
02:02:55,980 --> 02:02:56,981
[SPEAKER_03]: No, not Rob.

1260
02:02:58,602 --> 02:02:59,363
[SPEAKER_25]: We never know.

1261
02:03:01,084 --> 02:03:04,086
[SPEAKER_28]: My answer was increased breast size from those spammers.

1262
02:03:05,007 --> 02:03:06,147
[SPEAKER_25]: And increased penis size!

1263
02:03:08,469 --> 02:03:10,531
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry, we don't have a match.

1264
02:03:12,932 --> 02:03:13,633
[SPEAKER_03]: No match for you!

1265
02:03:15,253 --> 02:03:17,174
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you are loser.

1266
02:03:17,894 --> 02:03:19,495
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, last question.

1267
02:03:20,836 --> 02:03:25,979
[SPEAKER_03]: After playing seven games of DDR, Darla the Dancer decided to go rest by blank.

1268
02:03:27,540 --> 02:03:28,160
[SPEAKER_03]: Send in your answer.

1269
02:03:31,042 --> 02:03:33,163
[SPEAKER_03]: Darla the Dancer decided to rest by blank.

1270
02:03:50,370 --> 02:03:51,070
Thank you for watching!

1271
02:04:29,717 --> 02:04:30,498
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, we're back.

1272
02:04:31,578 --> 02:04:37,381
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, after seven games of DDR, Darla the Dancer decided to go rest by blank.

1273
02:04:37,841 --> 02:04:42,744
[SPEAKER_03]: EOSFB said, rest by cherry tree, er, I mean, Ron Jeremy's penis.

1274
02:04:45,425 --> 02:04:47,806
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkTetsuya said, masturbating with a bottle of Propel.

1275
02:04:57,172 --> 02:05:03,976
[SPEAKER_25]: How the hell do you masturbate with a bottle of Propel?

1276
02:05:04,016 --> 02:05:11,441
[SPEAKER_22]: Now a bottle of balls, that's different because it's kind of, you know, ribbed on the outside, so I assume that women might like that, you know.

1277
02:05:13,464 --> 02:05:20,869
[SPEAKER_25]: That's a little bit disturbing, but you could probably fit it inside, like, you know, like, Anna Nicole Smith's vagina, I guess, maybe.

1278
02:05:21,689 --> 02:05:23,831
[SPEAKER_28]: Don't get me started on the stories I've heard before.

1279
02:05:24,511 --> 02:05:25,031
[SPEAKER_25]: Such as?

1280
02:05:25,872 --> 02:05:26,733
[SPEAKER_25]: My mom's a nurse.

1281
02:05:26,773 --> 02:05:27,633
[SPEAKER_25]: I've heard stories.

1282
02:05:28,033 --> 02:05:28,914
[SPEAKER_25]: Okay, where's story?

1283
02:05:31,255 --> 02:05:31,976
[SPEAKER_28]: Yeah, I'll save it.

1284
02:05:32,436 --> 02:05:34,097
[SPEAKER_25]: Okay, she's gonna save it, but I wanna hear this.

1285
02:05:34,678 --> 02:05:35,738
[SPEAKER_22]: What's in their vagina?

1286
02:05:37,740 --> 02:05:39,641
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, we'll save that for right after the match game.

1287
02:05:39,721 --> 02:05:40,741
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that fair?

1288
02:05:42,042 --> 02:05:43,023
[SPEAKER_03]: My answer was

1289
02:05:45,251 --> 02:05:49,292
[SPEAKER_03]: After playing seven games of DDR, Darla the Dancer decided to go rest by... Propel.

1290
02:05:51,453 --> 02:05:51,953
[SPEAKER_03]: Just propel.

1291
02:05:53,273 --> 02:05:53,733
[SPEAKER_22]: Your answer.

1292
02:05:54,934 --> 02:05:59,395
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, rest by, are you talking about like an actual physical object that she's resting by?

1293
02:06:00,355 --> 02:06:01,156
[SPEAKER_03]: Just propel.

1294
02:06:02,096 --> 02:06:08,598
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay, well anyways, I was gonna say, uh, Darla the Dancer decided to go rest by watching Ron Jeremy suck his own penis.

1295
02:06:09,338 --> 02:06:13,139
[SPEAKER_22]: Since obviously that was every fucking other answer, ugh.

1296
02:06:17,154 --> 02:06:24,660
[SPEAKER_25]: Darla went to go rest by watching one of my ninja schoolgirls practice because I have ninja schoolgirls and they are kickass.

1297
02:06:27,703 --> 02:06:31,666
[SPEAKER_28]: I decided she was going to rest by blowing up Roseville Golf Land.

1298
02:06:34,148 --> 02:06:35,810
[SPEAKER_25]: I want this movie that has ninja schoolgirls.

1299
02:06:35,890 --> 02:06:36,950
[SPEAKER_25]: Ninja schoolgirls are cool.

1300
02:06:38,272 --> 02:06:40,994
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, blowing up Roseville Golf Land sounds like my idea of restful.

1301
02:06:41,614 --> 02:06:42,515
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, it sounds exciting.

1302
02:06:42,935 --> 02:06:44,697
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so DarkSakura gets half a point.

1303
02:06:44,777 --> 02:06:45,918
[SPEAKER_03]: EOSFP gets half a point.

1304
02:06:46,693 --> 02:06:48,655
[SPEAKER_03]: Which means that DarkSakura is our winner!

1305
02:06:48,875 --> 02:06:52,840
[SPEAKER_03]: Yay!

1306
02:06:55,402 --> 02:06:57,004
[SPEAKER_03]: You win a bloody anus!

1307
02:06:57,845 --> 02:06:59,066
[SPEAKER_03]: Here on Originals Radio!

1308
02:07:02,049 --> 02:07:06,214
[SPEAKER_03]: So Melody, you want to tell us about the segment, What Stuck Up the Vagina?

1309
02:07:09,244 --> 02:07:16,308
[SPEAKER_28]: It actually wouldn't be a vagina unless spammers have actually come up with how to grow a new vagina instead of, like, increased breast size.

1310
02:07:16,829 --> 02:07:25,934
[SPEAKER_28]: Now, my mom told me once she heard a story from an x-ray tech where this guy was complaining that, um, I don't remember what his complaint was, but they needed to do x-rays.

1311
02:07:26,415 --> 02:07:34,360
[SPEAKER_28]: So, um, x-ray tech took him into the x-ray room and positioned him and everything, and she turns out the light, because you have to turn out the light to take an x-ray.

1312
02:07:34,420 --> 02:07:36,401
[SPEAKER_28]: Well, there was still light in the room.

1313
02:07:37,885 --> 02:07:41,654
[SPEAKER_28]: She can't figure it out until she realized the light was coming from the guy's ass.

1314
02:07:43,137 --> 02:07:46,605
[SPEAKER_28]: Because he had inserted a flashlight and it had turned itself on.

1315
02:07:49,542 --> 02:07:59,971
[SPEAKER_25]: Now, I can understand if, you know, you're a little bit kinky and, you know, there's nothing wrong with anal sex, that's your thing, you know, go ahead and do it, you know, as long as you're careful.

1316
02:08:00,792 --> 02:08:08,619
[SPEAKER_25]: But there are just some things that shouldn't go in your ass, and I'm pretty sure flashlights, cell phones are one, but I'm pretty sure flashlights are up there in the top five.

1317
02:08:08,879 --> 02:08:10,941
[SPEAKER_25]: Barbie dolls or others, hamsters, no.

1318
02:08:11,762 --> 02:08:14,384
[SPEAKER_25]: You know, but, no, okay?

1319
02:08:14,904 --> 02:08:16,586
[SPEAKER_25]: Just flashlights, don't play that game.

1320
02:08:18,542 --> 02:08:21,545
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm no rocket scientist or anything, but you don't just fall on a cucumber, you know?

1321
02:08:21,565 --> 02:08:22,025
[SPEAKER_25]: Wait, hang on, Melody.

1322
02:08:47,080 --> 02:08:50,421
[SPEAKER_28]: My question is, why are you naked and falling on a cucumber in the first place?

1323
02:08:51,181 --> 02:08:59,824
[SPEAKER_25]: I do that every day, you know, I go home at random and, um, I just grease up a Crisco, a cucumber with Crisco, I just fall on that motherfucker because I feel like it.

1324
02:09:00,044 --> 02:09:01,965
[SPEAKER_25]: Fucking Johnny Knoxville wannabe motherfucker.

1325
02:09:04,666 --> 02:09:06,966
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we should introduce a new segment on the show, by the way.

1326
02:09:08,187 --> 02:09:09,367
[SPEAKER_03]: The Darwin Awards segment.

1327
02:09:11,428 --> 02:09:14,029
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to read some information off of the Darwin Awards.

1328
02:09:14,509 --> 02:09:15,229
[SPEAKER_03]: News stories.

1329
02:09:17,634 --> 02:09:20,577
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to read one called Midnight Snack.

1330
02:09:21,217 --> 02:09:23,399
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1331
02:09:23,499 --> 02:09:24,980
[SPEAKER_03]: 23rd October 2002, Australia.

1332
02:09:25,561 --> 02:09:28,183
[SPEAKER_03]: What, besides beer, is Australia's most recognizable symbol?

1333
02:09:28,643 --> 02:09:32,567
[SPEAKER_03]: Saltwater crocodiles, of course, as popularized by crocodile hunter Steve Irwin.

1334
02:09:33,766 --> 02:09:35,167
[SPEAKER_03]: What is the most natural tourist activity?

1335
02:09:35,447 --> 02:09:37,787
[SPEAKER_03]: Why viewing these amazing beauties in our natural habitat?

1336
02:09:38,328 --> 02:09:49,371
[SPEAKER_03]: Tourists from around the world visit the wild places of Australia, so open water is routinely posted with a graphic warning sign to let people know that swimming with these dinosaur-like carnivores is not a good idea.

1337
02:09:49,791 --> 02:09:52,392
[SPEAKER_03]: The sign typically shows a human figure between the jaws of a salty.

1338
02:09:53,272 --> 02:09:58,794
[SPEAKER_03]: The blunt graphic has proven so effective enough that there have been no crocodile-related deaths in the Northern Territory since 1998.

1339
02:09:58,834 --> 02:09:59,334
[SPEAKER_03]: At least, not until now.

1340
02:10:01,849 --> 02:10:02,430
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

1341
02:10:11,786 --> 02:10:16,530
[SPEAKER_03]: The woman, a short-lived member of an adventure tour group, was about to get more adventure than is generally advertised.

1342
02:10:16,991 --> 02:10:19,493
[SPEAKER_03]: Police Commander Max Pope stated, How's that for stupid?! !

1343
02:10:38,964 --> 02:10:40,205
[SPEAKER_22]: That's not that bad.

1344
02:10:40,285 --> 02:10:43,047
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean, I've seen, I've heard worse.

1345
02:10:43,868 --> 02:10:57,497
[SPEAKER_22]: There was a funny one about some guy that like fell over a cliff or the, something about like, I don't know, it had to do with some guy in a tree or something and then there was a truck on a cliff or something and they backed it up and ran over the guy in the tree.

1346
02:10:57,537 --> 02:10:59,819
[SPEAKER_25]: I got a Darwin Award.

1347
02:10:59,839 --> 02:11:02,120
[SPEAKER_25]: Pump Daddy thought he could come up with something fucking original.

1348
02:11:02,160 --> 02:11:02,861
[SPEAKER_25]: There's your Darwin.

1349
02:11:03,902 --> 02:11:04,562
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's another one.

1350
02:11:05,403 --> 02:11:06,223
[SPEAKER_03]: November 2002, The Netherlands.

1351
02:11:07,694 --> 02:11:08,556
[SPEAKER_03]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1352
02:11:21,264 --> 02:11:24,847
[SPEAKER_03]: Then a detective missed a bullet by inches when he opened a booby-trapped wooden chest.

1353
02:11:25,307 --> 02:11:28,409
[SPEAKER_03]: Police beat a hasty retreat from the property and called in military experts.

1354
02:11:29,030 --> 02:11:34,374
[SPEAKER_03]: They deciphered an enigmatic series of scribbled clues to locate 19 death traps in walls, ceilings, and household objects.

1355
02:11:35,074 --> 02:11:42,279
[SPEAKER_03]: A pile of booby-trapped dinner plates was revealed by the clue, Cheaper by the Dozen, a reference to a film in which a child throws a plate at someone's head.

1356
02:11:42,900 --> 02:11:45,562
[SPEAKER_03]: Police speculate that the notes were intended to assist his failing memory.

1357
02:11:46,747 --> 02:11:55,270
[SPEAKER_03]: Other traps included numerous concealed shotguns triggered by threads and an exploding crate of beer set to detonate once a certain number of bottles were removed.

1358
02:11:56,170 --> 02:12:01,112
[SPEAKER_03]: It took three weeks to crack 19 of the 20 clues, and experts were forced to admit defeat on the final note.

1359
02:12:01,512 --> 02:12:04,613
[SPEAKER_03]: The Twelve Apostles are ready to work on the pebbles, said one.

1360
02:12:05,033 --> 02:12:06,734
[SPEAKER_03]: We have never come across anything like it before.

1361
02:12:06,874 --> 02:12:07,954
[SPEAKER_03]: It was all fiendishly clever.

1362
02:12:08,726 --> 02:12:15,947
[SPEAKER_03]: True to form, the fiendishly clever but careless Darwin Award winner was described by neighbors as a tactical but harmless man who employed puttering in his garage.

1363
02:12:16,787 --> 02:12:20,068
[SPEAKER_03]: But relatives say he never forgave his wife for divorcing him 20 years before.

1364
02:12:20,828 --> 02:12:24,889
[SPEAKER_03]: Police believe he began installing the traps for four years after losing a lengthy battle to keep his home.

1365
02:12:25,789 --> 02:12:34,050
[SPEAKER_03]: Although some may argue that 14 children in his advanced age rule out a Darwin Award, the judges feel the magnitude of his actions overcome by these practical concerns.

1366
02:12:35,731 --> 02:12:36,531
[SPEAKER_03]: That one was cool.

1367
02:12:37,651 --> 02:12:41,314
[SPEAKER_03]: Booby-trapping your home with 20 traps intended to kill your family.

1368
02:12:56,878 --> 02:13:13,227
[SPEAKER_28]: In World War I or II, I can't remember which, I don't think I ever really knew, and he lives in the Midwest in Missouri, and he passed away recently, and my aunt and uncle moved into his house, and they were going through some of his stuff in his basement and found a bunch of his World War I memorabilia, and they found a hand grenade.

1369
02:13:14,622 --> 02:13:17,123
[SPEAKER_28]: Now, they're like, okay, this is interesting, so they call the St.

1370
02:13:17,143 --> 02:13:23,004
[SPEAKER_28]: Joseph's Police, who have no bomb squad, because it's not a small town, but it's not exactly huge, so they have to call Kansas City.

1371
02:13:23,365 --> 02:13:28,946
[SPEAKER_28]: Well, Kansas City, of course, has a bomb squad, but they can't really do anything about it, because it's a good hour's drive away.

1372
02:13:30,067 --> 02:13:35,428
[SPEAKER_28]: So, Kansas City says, okay, call Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, for help.

1373
02:13:36,768 --> 02:13:37,789
[SPEAKER_28]: They call Fort Leavenworth.

1374
02:13:37,829 --> 02:13:41,870
[SPEAKER_28]: The first thing that Fort Leavenworth says is, okay, well, where is the hand grenade?

1375
02:13:42,987 --> 02:13:44,908
[SPEAKER_28]: And they're like, it's right next to us.

1376
02:13:45,829 --> 02:13:49,271
[SPEAKER_28]: The first thing they say is, get out of the house this instant.

1377
02:13:50,172 --> 02:13:51,312
[SPEAKER_28]: Hang up the phone and leave.

1378
02:13:51,653 --> 02:13:58,057
[SPEAKER_28]: Because apparently these grenades, when they're this old, have a tendency to go off on their own, just from being handled.

1379
02:13:58,297 --> 02:14:00,839
[SPEAKER_28]: My uncle was tossing the damn thing in the air at the time.

1380
02:14:00,859 --> 02:14:04,041
[SPEAKER_28]: He was like freaking juggling the hand grenade.

1381
02:14:04,481 --> 02:14:10,625
[SPEAKER_28]: Fort Leavenworth drove out to my uncle's old house, got the grenade, put it in a brawn-proof box,

1382
02:14:11,354 --> 02:14:16,496
[SPEAKER_28]: Duck tape the box to all freaking hell and had to take it back to the base to be exploded.

1383
02:14:18,056 --> 02:14:21,518
[SPEAKER_25]: Because remember, folks, duct tape prevents explosions.

1384
02:14:23,618 --> 02:14:25,739
[SPEAKER_03]: And apparently it's good for acne or something.

1385
02:14:25,759 --> 02:14:26,680
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

1386
02:14:26,700 --> 02:14:27,840
[SPEAKER_28]: Stupid as all hell.

1387
02:14:30,201 --> 02:14:33,942
[SPEAKER_28]: And my uncle is stupid as all hell because, yeah, he's just in here and he's do-do-do-do-do.

1388
02:14:34,182 --> 02:14:34,943
[SPEAKER_28]: Here's the hand grenade.

1389
02:14:34,963 --> 02:14:36,003
[SPEAKER_28]: I think I'll toss it in the air.

1390
02:14:38,744 --> 02:14:39,004
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1391
02:14:39,614 --> 02:14:41,295
[SPEAKER_03]: I think on that note, we need to go to a break.

1392
02:14:42,876 --> 02:14:53,301
[SPEAKER_03]: In this break, for the sake of Gumby, who is in our chat room, and hopefully listening to the show, we are going to play a song just for you.

1393
02:14:55,122 --> 02:14:58,424
[SPEAKER_03]: We are going to play Bumblebee, Sky's Voice Remix.

1394
02:15:01,705 --> 02:15:04,747
[SPEAKER_03]: And we are going to play some random other stuff, maybe...

1395
02:15:06,812 --> 02:15:10,253
[SPEAKER_03]: Quick Master from Poppin' Music, and some other random stuff.

1396
02:15:11,233 --> 02:15:16,214
[SPEAKER_03]: This is from one of Rob's fuck-off shows, so here goes.

1397
02:15:19,615 --> 02:15:27,576
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, I guess we're going to do one more, because I got these much better parody lyrics for Bumblebee than that shit I did a little bit ago, so we're going to do this one instead.

1398
02:15:27,616 --> 02:15:30,077
[SPEAKER_00]: This comes from DDR Angel and Stressa.

1399
02:15:30,097 --> 02:15:31,537
[SPEAKER_00]: This is much better, so enjoy.

1400
02:15:35,522 --> 02:15:37,844
[SPEAKER_13]: I know I'm gonna fuck this up, I apologize.

1401
02:15:37,864 --> 02:15:38,245
[SPEAKER_13]: Fuck you!

1402
02:16:03,655 --> 02:16:27,603
[SPEAKER_16]: My foot kicks your ass when you walk in the room I go boom, boom, boom, you go zoom, zoom, zoom You're my format dance path, you're a real friend I wanna kick your ass until you're dead I'll shove my foot right up your ass To help you see it's true I don't like you, can't you see?

1403
02:16:27,983 --> 02:16:29,564
[SPEAKER_16]: Now get the fuck away from me

1404
02:16:31,656 --> 02:16:39,778
[SPEAKER_16]: Sweet little bumblebee, get the fuck away from me Sweet little bumblebee, just a bunch of fantasy Fuck you!

1405
02:20:30,051 --> 02:20:30,715
Thanks for watching!

1406
02:21:18,854 --> 02:21:20,025
Thank you for watching

1407
02:23:34,167 --> 02:23:35,327
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry, that was dead air.

1408
02:23:35,387 --> 02:23:36,027
[SPEAKER_03]: My apologies.

1409
02:23:36,427 --> 02:23:37,188
[SPEAKER_03]: We're live again.

1410
02:23:37,868 --> 02:23:39,068
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, let's do a quick promo.

1411
02:23:39,368 --> 02:23:40,328
[SPEAKER_03]: Listen to our show's radio.

1412
02:23:40,548 --> 02:23:41,869
[SPEAKER_03]: Yay!

1413
02:23:44,255 --> 02:23:47,337
[SPEAKER_03]: Ask Orange Lounge

1414
02:24:08,906 --> 02:24:10,527
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll send you answers!

1415
02:24:12,208 --> 02:24:14,629
[SPEAKER_03]: In the interim, I'll go ahead... I just used a big word.

1416
02:24:14,649 --> 02:24:15,830
[SPEAKER_03]: I wonder if they can understand that.

1417
02:24:16,550 --> 02:24:16,730
[SPEAKER_03]: No?

1418
02:24:18,391 --> 02:24:20,392
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I have some, but not like I can play them on here.

1419
02:24:21,713 --> 02:24:25,134
[SPEAKER_03]: Once we get about four questions up, then I'll go ahead and come back.

1420
02:24:25,154 --> 02:24:31,117
[SPEAKER_03]: But right now... See, this is the song that I've been wanting us to play during our little questions.

1421
02:24:31,177 --> 02:24:36,080
[SPEAKER_03]: And I dedicate this particular song to the dearly departed Oolong the Bunny.

1422
02:24:37,421 --> 02:24:39,323
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to cosplay Oolong the Bunny, aren't we?

1423
02:24:40,964 --> 02:24:41,965
[SPEAKER_22]: I guess that's the plan, yep.

1424
02:24:42,846 --> 02:24:43,386
[SPEAKER_22]: That'd be fun.

1425
02:24:44,407 --> 02:24:45,749
[SPEAKER_03]: I have costumes sort of designed.

1426
02:24:45,789 --> 02:24:47,150
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll have to draw it out for you.

1427
02:24:47,250 --> 02:24:47,910
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really cool.

1428
02:24:51,794 --> 02:24:55,437
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I have to make leg warmers, and I know how to do it.

1429
02:24:55,898 --> 02:24:59,261
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to have the leg warmers and the bunny feet, but I know how to make bunny feet.

1430
02:24:59,821 --> 02:25:01,523
[SPEAKER_03]: I know how to make bunny feet that fit over shoes.

1431
02:25:03,491 --> 02:25:06,273
[SPEAKER_22]: All this bunny feet and leg warmer stuff's got me scared, okay?

1432
02:25:06,313 --> 02:25:08,535
[SPEAKER_22]: I just, I wanted ears and a pancake.

1433
02:25:08,795 --> 02:25:09,295
[SPEAKER_22]: That's it.

1434
02:25:09,815 --> 02:25:11,537
[SPEAKER_22]: Ears, pancake, nothing else.

1435
02:25:13,578 --> 02:25:14,559
[SPEAKER_28]: And this one's for Rob.

1436
02:25:14,839 --> 02:25:15,499
[SPEAKER_28]: I want sleep.

1437
02:25:15,879 --> 02:25:16,460
[SPEAKER_28]: Or pancake.

1438
02:25:18,781 --> 02:25:19,222
[SPEAKER_03]: Fine.

1439
02:25:19,662 --> 02:25:21,143
[SPEAKER_03]: Keep in mind, I am a cosplayer.

1440
02:25:23,827 --> 02:25:26,788
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, we're going to wait until we get a few more answers in.

1441
02:25:26,808 --> 02:25:32,669
[SPEAKER_03]: So in the meantime, this is the song that we wanted to have for our Ask Orange Challenge.

1442
02:25:32,729 --> 02:25:35,089
[SPEAKER_03]: It's The Rabbits with Usao-kun from Keyboard Mania.

1443
02:25:36,709 --> 02:25:38,090
Usao-kun, Usao-kun

1444
02:25:56,464 --> 02:26:24,120
[SPEAKER_10]: Kyou wa okozukai de HAPPY na GUTSU GETTO Demo nani kawuka Mayocchan da yone Genki itai Onaka mo itai Rinrin de herushii time ga Rikkuri time

1445
02:26:42,162 --> 02:26:48,045
[SPEAKER_10]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1446
02:27:11,101 --> 02:27:11,542
[SPEAKER_03]: We're back!

1447
02:27:11,602 --> 02:27:12,143
[SPEAKER_03]: We're live!

1448
02:27:12,623 --> 02:27:14,746
[SPEAKER_03]: And our first question comes from 23rebellious.

1449
02:27:15,327 --> 02:27:23,439
[SPEAKER_03]: It said, What would I do with a video of Ron Jeremy and two kawaii Japanese girls in a bucket of chocolate ready whip?

1450
02:27:24,340 --> 02:27:26,063
[SPEAKER_03]: I would go watch the video of Ron Jeremy.

1451
02:27:27,623 --> 02:27:32,007
[SPEAKER_03]: I would send the two kawaii Japanese schoolgirls to go buy me some booze.

1452
02:27:33,728 --> 02:27:36,570
[SPEAKER_03]: And I would eat the bucket of chocolate ready whip.

1453
02:27:37,631 --> 02:27:39,653
[SPEAKER_03]: Did Udo and the bunny taste like chicken or pancakes?

1454
02:27:40,193 --> 02:27:41,054
[SPEAKER_03]: He tasted like rabbit.

1455
02:27:42,675 --> 02:27:45,097
[SPEAKER_03]: And from DarkTensia, who's the most drunk?

1456
02:27:45,257 --> 02:27:45,477
[SPEAKER_03]: Me!

1457
02:27:47,259 --> 02:27:48,700
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think you're drunk enough yet.

1458
02:27:48,780 --> 02:27:49,561
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, shit.

1459
02:27:50,722 --> 02:27:52,363
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't fall down the stairs.

1460
02:27:52,383 --> 02:27:56,066
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, that, I need...

1461
02:27:56,553 --> 02:27:57,273
[SPEAKER_03]: That fell over.

1462
02:27:57,474 --> 02:27:58,174
[SPEAKER_03]: I need to pick that up.

1463
02:27:59,455 --> 02:28:00,375
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't stare at it.

1464
02:28:00,836 --> 02:28:01,676
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't have to.

1465
02:28:02,317 --> 02:28:03,697
[SPEAKER_03]: No, don't clean my house.

1466
02:28:04,458 --> 02:28:04,978
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, thank you.

1467
02:28:06,259 --> 02:28:08,000
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, Loki's cleaning my house.

1468
02:28:08,180 --> 02:28:08,740
[SPEAKER_03]: That's cool.

1469
02:28:09,841 --> 02:28:11,462
[SPEAKER_03]: So do you do Windows?

1470
02:28:13,523 --> 02:28:14,244
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't do Windows.

1471
02:28:15,044 --> 02:28:15,204
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

1472
02:28:21,465 --> 02:28:22,566
[SPEAKER_28]: Do I do Windows?

1473
02:28:22,686 --> 02:28:24,267
[SPEAKER_28]: Don't ask me, I've got the Mac.

1474
02:28:24,347 --> 02:28:26,529
[SPEAKER_28]: My pretty little power book is sitting right here.

1475
02:28:35,836 --> 02:28:36,777
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm a little tipsy.

1476
02:28:38,098 --> 02:28:39,939
[SPEAKER_28]: Don't make me throw my empty flask at you.

1477
02:28:41,420 --> 02:28:41,960
[SPEAKER_28]: Can I keep it?

1478
02:28:42,601 --> 02:28:42,881
[SPEAKER_10]: No.

1479
02:28:46,364 --> 02:28:46,444
[SPEAKER_02]: Um...

1480
02:28:48,362 --> 02:28:51,123
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we were doing Ask Orange Challenge, but only two of you people care.

1481
02:28:51,744 --> 02:28:54,105
[SPEAKER_03]: So, we're going to do something else.

1482
02:28:54,545 --> 02:28:56,166
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, we have time for a list list, don't we?

1483
02:28:58,087 --> 02:29:01,748
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, well, why don't we do a list list that all four of us can participate in?

1484
02:29:03,449 --> 02:29:10,412
[SPEAKER_03]: How about... Okay, alright.

1485
02:29:10,873 --> 02:29:15,815
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to do... For our list list, we're going to do... Favorite Alcohol!

1486
02:29:17,372 --> 02:29:18,813
[SPEAKER_03]: For any reason whatsoever.

1487
02:29:20,213 --> 02:29:21,314
[SPEAKER_03]: Here on Orange House Radio.

1488
02:29:22,074 --> 02:29:24,795
[SPEAKER_03]: In the meantime, we'll go ahead and play more music.

1489
02:29:25,616 --> 02:29:26,556
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I have some.

1490
02:29:26,616 --> 02:29:27,136
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't have some.

1491
02:29:27,376 --> 02:29:28,337
[SPEAKER_03]: Wait, we have more questions.

1492
02:29:29,077 --> 02:29:29,958
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there a cage match this week?

1493
02:29:30,078 --> 02:29:30,938
[SPEAKER_29]: No, because Rob's not here.

1494
02:29:31,838 --> 02:29:32,479
[SPEAKER_03]: Next question.

1495
02:29:33,879 --> 02:29:38,841
[SPEAKER_03]: 23Megas, which is the better oxymoron, Microsoft Works, Legally Drunk, or Military Intelligence?

1496
02:29:39,802 --> 02:29:42,503
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the only one of those that really counts is Military Intelligence.

1497
02:29:42,763 --> 02:29:43,043
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

1498
02:29:44,004 --> 02:29:44,624
[SPEAKER_22]: Honest American.

1499
02:29:46,400 --> 02:29:46,920
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm honest.

1500
02:29:47,780 --> 02:29:50,361
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll go up to somebody and tell them that they fucking suck to their face.

1501
02:29:50,721 --> 02:29:50,961
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

1502
02:29:53,082 --> 02:29:54,182
[SPEAKER_25]: Military intelligence.

1503
02:29:54,242 --> 02:29:58,423
[SPEAKER_25]: Our nuclear weapons are in the hands of a man who cannot sing Jingle Bells.

1504
02:29:58,823 --> 02:29:59,704
[SPEAKER_25]: There's a problem with that.

1505
02:30:00,524 --> 02:30:01,744
[SPEAKER_28]: On a different subject, yes.

1506
02:30:02,024 --> 02:30:03,084
[SPEAKER_28]: Jamie drives.

1507
02:30:03,685 --> 02:30:10,046
[SPEAKER_28]: And Jamie driving... Driving with Jamie is kind of fun because she will tell everyone that they suck to their faces.

1508
02:30:10,426 --> 02:30:11,527
[SPEAKER_28]: Plus, she will flip them off.

1509
02:30:11,567 --> 02:30:13,147
[SPEAKER_28]: She will, like, speed around them.

1510
02:30:13,187 --> 02:30:14,688
[SPEAKER_28]: If they're slow, she'll just go around them.

1511
02:30:14,768 --> 02:30:15,248
[SPEAKER_28]: It's great.

1512
02:30:15,328 --> 02:30:16,148
[SPEAKER_28]: It's so entertaining.

1513
02:30:18,009 --> 02:30:19,951
[SPEAKER_25]: Jamie isn't called DarkSakura for anything.

1514
02:30:20,292 --> 02:30:26,258
[SPEAKER_25]: She'll rage and demon your ass and then tap dance on your fucking grave like Savian Glover and then laugh at your family.

1515
02:30:26,438 --> 02:30:26,819
[SPEAKER_25]: It's great.

1516
02:30:27,574 --> 02:30:28,354
[SPEAKER_03]: That sounds like fun.

1517
02:30:28,394 --> 02:30:29,335
[SPEAKER_03]: I should do that next time.

1518
02:30:32,916 --> 02:30:39,379
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so I'm going to play a few songs while we come up with what are... Why do people have to get political on Orange Dolls Radio?

1519
02:30:39,459 --> 02:30:39,839
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck them.

1520
02:30:40,199 --> 02:30:41,320
[SPEAKER_03]: That's because we're older than you.

1521
02:30:41,840 --> 02:30:43,561
[SPEAKER_03]: And we actually have something called maturity.

1522
02:30:43,861 --> 02:30:45,642
[SPEAKER_22]: We can freestyle better than you can.

1523
02:30:46,562 --> 02:30:46,942
[SPEAKER_22]: That's it.

1524
02:30:47,482 --> 02:30:49,163
[SPEAKER_03]: Because we can freestyle better than you can.

1525
02:30:49,183 --> 02:30:50,964
[SPEAKER_22]: In both respects.

1526
02:30:51,284 --> 02:30:53,265
[SPEAKER_03]: So, let's go ahead and go.

1527
02:30:53,285 --> 02:30:53,785
[SPEAKER_03]: In both respects.

1528
02:31:18,757 --> 02:31:26,681
[SPEAKER_13]: He knew every magic trick under the sun But he'd forgotten everyone and had some fun Monkey Magic, Monkey Magic Monkey Magic, Monkey Magic

1529
02:31:42,426 --> 02:31:43,147
Thanks for watching!

1530
02:32:05,836 --> 02:32:14,966
[SPEAKER_13]: Smokey and everyone We do every magic trick under the sun Take the gods and everyone and have some fun Monkey Magic, Monkey Magic Monkey Magic, Monkey Magic

1531
02:36:35,468 --> 02:36:36,390
Thanks for watching!

1532
02:37:33,823 --> 02:37:34,523
[SPEAKER_12]: Nico, meow.

1533
02:37:34,724 --> 02:37:35,364
Meow, meow.

1534
02:37:35,464 --> 02:37:36,204
[SPEAKER_12]: Nico, meow.

1535
02:37:36,344 --> 02:37:37,005
[SPEAKER_13]: Meow, meow.

1536
02:37:37,025 --> 02:37:38,025
[SPEAKER_12]: Nico, meow.

1537
02:37:38,245 --> 02:37:39,186
[SPEAKER_12]: Meow, meow.

1538
02:37:39,526 --> 02:37:40,066
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, ass!

1539
02:37:40,627 --> 02:37:43,308
[SPEAKER_12]: This randomness could only be brought to you by Orange Lounge.

1540
02:37:47,250 --> 02:37:47,710
[SPEAKER_03]: We're back.

1541
02:37:49,391 --> 02:37:50,672
[SPEAKER_03]: And we want to say bye to everybody.

1542
02:37:51,913 --> 02:37:55,134
[SPEAKER_24]: Bye-bye, everyone, all the listeners of Orange Lounge.

1543
02:37:55,655 --> 02:37:56,135
[SPEAKER_24]: I am Outer.

1544
02:37:56,175 --> 02:37:57,315
[SPEAKER_24]: I am taking off for the night.

1545
02:37:57,375 --> 02:37:58,056
[SPEAKER_24]: Bye-bye.

1546
02:38:00,294 --> 02:38:00,674
[SPEAKER_03]: Take care.

1547
02:38:00,734 --> 02:38:01,295
[SPEAKER_03]: Drive safely.

1548
02:38:01,655 --> 02:38:03,096
[SPEAKER_03]: Bye, Waifipu.

1549
02:38:03,856 --> 02:38:04,477
[SPEAKER_03]: Take care.

1550
02:38:08,919 --> 02:38:10,060
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so we're back.

1551
02:38:10,140 --> 02:38:12,341
[SPEAKER_03]: We've all got our song.

1552
02:38:12,381 --> 02:38:14,903
[SPEAKER_03]: So why don't we just go ahead and we'll start with Loki.

1553
02:38:14,923 --> 02:38:17,184
[SPEAKER_03]: What's your top number three alcohol?

1554
02:38:19,506 --> 02:38:20,646
[SPEAKER_22]: Because I don't drink alcohol.

1555
02:38:21,147 --> 02:38:24,649
[SPEAKER_22]: We'll go with number three being Grog because Monkey Island rules.

1556
02:38:26,903 --> 02:38:28,204
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, number three, Grog.

1557
02:38:28,805 --> 02:38:29,126
[SPEAKER_03]: And yours?

1558
02:38:30,687 --> 02:38:37,535
[SPEAKER_25]: Number three on the tone poll would probably have to be Smirnoff Vanilla Twist Alcohol.

1559
02:38:37,936 --> 02:38:38,616
[SPEAKER_25]: It's good shit.

1560
02:38:39,377 --> 02:38:40,538
[SPEAKER_25]: Perfect for mixing with drinks.

1561
02:38:40,879 --> 02:38:41,740
[SPEAKER_25]: Especially orange juice.

1562
02:38:41,760 --> 02:38:42,120
[SPEAKER_25]: It's good.

1563
02:38:43,882 --> 02:38:44,843
[SPEAKER_03]: Vanilla and orange.

1564
02:38:44,863 --> 02:38:46,085
[SPEAKER_03]: Doesn't it be like a cream soda, wouldn't it?

1565
02:38:49,178 --> 02:38:51,420
[SPEAKER_03]: We actually did have another participant.

1566
02:38:51,460 --> 02:38:52,901
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll go ahead and name my number three.

1567
02:38:53,481 --> 02:38:55,223
[SPEAKER_03]: My number three is Whaler's Vanilla Rum.

1568
02:38:56,203 --> 02:38:56,544
[SPEAKER_03]: Yummy.

1569
02:38:58,345 --> 02:39:02,128
[SPEAKER_25]: I hold Mike now as she types in Whaler's Vanilla Rum, which is probably really good stuff.

1570
02:39:02,388 --> 02:39:04,610
[SPEAKER_25]: Our fourth participant is downstairs.

1571
02:39:05,731 --> 02:39:07,252
[SPEAKER_25]: DarkSakura's going to get her right now.

1572
02:39:08,934 --> 02:39:10,515
[SPEAKER_25]: She's getting the name of her favorite alcohol.

1573
02:39:12,416 --> 02:39:13,117
[SPEAKER_25]: She's picking one.

1574
02:39:16,455 --> 02:39:18,576
[SPEAKER_25]: She's giving her something to drink right now, I don't know.

1575
02:39:20,036 --> 02:39:21,076
[SPEAKER_25]: Everybody!

1576
02:39:23,777 --> 02:39:24,937
[SPEAKER_25]: Everybody!

1577
02:39:25,318 --> 02:39:29,259
[SPEAKER_25]: Wait, here's Melody with her third favorite alcohol.

1578
02:39:29,979 --> 02:39:31,039
[SPEAKER_28]: Vodka, any of it.

1579
02:39:32,379 --> 02:39:33,220
[SPEAKER_25]: Any type of vodka.

1580
02:39:34,580 --> 02:39:36,941
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, number two favorite alcohol, Matt.

1581
02:39:38,361 --> 02:39:40,702
[SPEAKER_22]: Um, this is for Rob because I don't have a number two.

1582
02:39:41,122 --> 02:39:41,942
[SPEAKER_22]: Goldschlager.

1583
02:39:49,502 --> 02:39:51,702
[SPEAKER_25]: Number two would have to be Sapporo Beer.

1584
02:39:52,663 --> 02:39:54,083
[SPEAKER_25]: Sapporo is the best beer.

1585
02:39:54,103 --> 02:39:56,004
[SPEAKER_25]: It has high alcohol content.

1586
02:39:56,024 --> 02:39:57,284
[SPEAKER_25]: It's perfect with sushi.

1587
02:39:57,864 --> 02:40:01,345
[SPEAKER_25]: Especially if you're watching schoolgirls or chicks in maid outfits doing their thing.

1588
02:40:01,385 --> 02:40:01,845
[SPEAKER_25]: It's great.

1589
02:40:01,925 --> 02:40:04,086
[SPEAKER_25]: Or guys in school uniforms.

1590
02:40:04,346 --> 02:40:04,946
[SPEAKER_25]: That's another story.

1591
02:40:04,966 --> 02:40:05,226
[SPEAKER_25]: Anyway.

1592
02:40:06,607 --> 02:40:07,647
[SPEAKER_28]: Actually, I take it back.

1593
02:40:08,327 --> 02:40:09,227
[SPEAKER_28]: Rum is number three.

1594
02:40:09,267 --> 02:40:10,127
[SPEAKER_28]: Vodka is number two.

1595
02:40:11,408 --> 02:40:11,848
[SPEAKER_23]: There you go.

1596
02:40:14,432 --> 02:40:18,020
[SPEAKER_03]: My number three is Godiva, of course, chocolate liqueur.

1597
02:40:18,842 --> 02:40:22,149
[SPEAKER_03]: How can, for me, my number two, sorry.

1598
02:40:22,830 --> 02:40:23,291
[SPEAKER_03]: Your number one?

1599
02:40:24,619 --> 02:40:36,343
[SPEAKER_22]: My number one has to be Peppermint Schnapps, because after about a full bottle of that, both my ex-girlfriend and her friend, I think, went lesbian for like the night.

1600
02:40:36,523 --> 02:40:38,524
[SPEAKER_22]: So, I dedicate that to them.

1601
02:40:40,145 --> 02:40:43,286
[SPEAKER_22]: You know, that's one of those things that's going to kick me the rest of my life.

1602
02:40:43,406 --> 02:40:44,086
[SPEAKER_22]: No, I did not.

1603
02:40:44,946 --> 02:40:45,167
[SPEAKER_22]: Yep.

1604
02:40:45,587 --> 02:40:47,567
[SPEAKER_22]: So, we think.

1605
02:40:47,627 --> 02:40:48,148
[SPEAKER_22]: We don't know.

1606
02:40:48,168 --> 02:40:51,729
[SPEAKER_22]: They disappeared into my room for a while, and they don't remember anything that went on.

1607
02:40:53,880 --> 02:40:54,480
[SPEAKER_22]: So they say.

1608
02:40:55,881 --> 02:41:02,205
[SPEAKER_25]: If your ex-girlfriend and girlfriend ever disappear into a room under the influence of alcohol, you better be up in that motherfucker.

1609
02:41:03,226 --> 02:41:04,947
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, ex-girlfriend and her friend.

1610
02:41:05,487 --> 02:41:08,309
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, she was my girlfriend at the time, so yeah, I should have, but...

1611
02:41:08,942 --> 02:41:12,164
[SPEAKER_25]: I would have been all over that like a bad rash on Pamela Anderson Lee.

1612
02:41:12,524 --> 02:41:16,887
[SPEAKER_25]: Number one would have to be the Godiva soy milk combination that I had tonight with DarkSakura.

1613
02:41:16,927 --> 02:41:17,788
[SPEAKER_25]: That's the new number one.

1614
02:41:17,848 --> 02:41:19,769
[SPEAKER_25]: Goes down smooth and goddamn, I'm buzzin'.

1615
02:41:20,309 --> 02:41:24,792
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm so numb that somebody could cut my arm off and beat me with it and I would not feel it.

1616
02:41:24,852 --> 02:41:28,895
[SPEAKER_28]: First off, listen, hey Jamie, you wanna go in that room five feet away and lock the door?

1617
02:41:29,275 --> 02:41:31,917
[SPEAKER_28]: Well, you know, they did say that after I got socially drunk I'd turn lesbian.

1618
02:41:32,457 --> 02:41:33,258
[SPEAKER_28]: Woohoo.

1619
02:41:33,738 --> 02:41:34,198
[SPEAKER_28]: Woohoo.

1620
02:41:34,218 --> 02:41:36,460
[SPEAKER_23]: Remember, don't say unless you mean it!

1621
02:41:37,180 --> 02:41:38,321
[SPEAKER_23]: I want photos!

1622
02:41:39,114 --> 02:41:44,936
[SPEAKER_28]: And my number one has to be that Vermeer chocolate liqueur that Mel gave me because good lord that shit is good.

1623
02:41:45,797 --> 02:41:47,017
[SPEAKER_28]: V-E-R-M-E-E-R.

1624
02:41:47,857 --> 02:41:50,318
[SPEAKER_28]: It's Dutch chocolate liqueur and you can get it at Safeway.

1625
02:41:50,618 --> 02:41:51,039
[SPEAKER_28]: Best ever.

1626
02:41:51,499 --> 02:41:56,020
[SPEAKER_25]: Shouts out to Felix the Friendly Traveler for providing the alcohol at DistortedEchoes.com.

1627
02:41:56,040 --> 02:42:00,082
[SPEAKER_25]: Go pick up any project that Lawrence Trifon and Felix the Friendly Traveler do because that's dope shit.

1628
02:42:00,402 --> 02:42:01,502
[SPEAKER_25]: Felix, you may never know.

1629
02:42:01,522 --> 02:42:02,323
[SPEAKER_25]: 2003, I could come back.

1630
02:42:03,977 --> 02:42:08,439
[SPEAKER_03]: My number one would be Just Desserts brand creme brulee liqueur.

1631
02:42:09,500 --> 02:42:10,720
[SPEAKER_03]: You get it at Trader Joe's.

1632
02:42:10,781 --> 02:42:12,141
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the only place I've seen that one.

1633
02:42:12,782 --> 02:42:15,603
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's like $6 a bottle and it tastes like it should cost more.

1634
02:42:15,643 --> 02:42:16,824
[SPEAKER_03]: That stuff is the best.

1635
02:42:16,844 --> 02:42:20,525
[SPEAKER_03]: So do you want to go ahead and vote off one?

1636
02:42:23,107 --> 02:42:24,027
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay.

1637
02:42:24,708 --> 02:42:27,709
[SPEAKER_22]: Just because someone else is going to vote it off and I'll just save them the time.

1638
02:42:27,749 --> 02:42:28,129
[SPEAKER_22]: Grog.

1639
02:42:28,309 --> 02:42:33,032
[SPEAKER_22]: Because that's a stupid third pick by me and I just don't care.

1640
02:42:33,152 --> 02:42:33,452
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm tired.

1641
02:42:36,497 --> 02:42:45,122
[SPEAKER_25]: Um, we have to get rid of the Sopro, even though it's one of my favorites, because it is a... I put it on there, but in comparison to the other alcohols, it's a beer.

1642
02:42:45,622 --> 02:42:47,403
[SPEAKER_25]: And beer just doesn't stand up to liquor.

1643
02:42:47,923 --> 02:42:51,285
[SPEAKER_25]: Although it is an acquired taste, liquor has more of a flavor to it.

1644
02:42:51,645 --> 02:42:55,127
[SPEAKER_25]: You can't mix liquor... You can mix liquor with anything, you can't mix beer with anything.

1645
02:42:55,607 --> 02:42:59,049
[SPEAKER_28]: So... Vote one off the island.

1646
02:43:01,170 --> 02:43:01,850
[SPEAKER_28]: Uh, Jerry!

1647
02:43:02,010 --> 02:43:04,912
[SPEAKER_28]: No, um... Um, what are our options?

1648
02:43:04,992 --> 02:43:05,512
[SPEAKER_11]: American Idol!

1649
02:43:06,208 --> 02:43:13,129
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm saying rum because even though I voted it on, I got really freaking drunk on it once and it made me unhappy.

1650
02:43:13,770 --> 02:43:15,290
[SPEAKER_03]: God, everyone's voting their own shit off.

1651
02:43:15,650 --> 02:43:16,850
[SPEAKER_03]: You left the light on in the bathroom.

1652
02:43:17,170 --> 02:43:17,710
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that's why.

1653
02:43:18,170 --> 02:43:18,371
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1654
02:43:20,011 --> 02:43:21,251
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I'm going to vote off?

1655
02:43:22,691 --> 02:43:23,692
[SPEAKER_03]: Peppermint schnapps!

1656
02:43:25,832 --> 02:43:30,733
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I've had peppermint schnapps before and I thought it was going to kill me.

1657
02:43:30,833 --> 02:43:31,853
[SPEAKER_03]: It tasted like burning.

1658
02:43:32,893 --> 02:43:35,434
[SPEAKER_03]: It tasted like burning heat.

1659
02:43:39,728 --> 02:43:41,409
[SPEAKER_22]: That's what they felt that night.

1660
02:43:43,049 --> 02:43:43,570
[SPEAKER_22]: God damn it.

1661
02:43:44,130 --> 02:43:52,534
[SPEAKER_22]: You see, Peppermint Schnoss, man, that shit got my ex-girlfriend to yell, I can suck his dick and you can't, arguing with her friend.

1662
02:43:53,374 --> 02:43:55,795
[SPEAKER_03]: I just heard you say that you can suck someone's dick.

1663
02:43:56,535 --> 02:43:59,176
[SPEAKER_22]: No, I was quoting my ex-girlfriend, okay?

1664
02:44:00,197 --> 02:44:03,578
[SPEAKER_25]: There's absolutely nothing wrong with sucking dick as long as the person is clean.

1665
02:44:03,618 --> 02:44:04,839
[SPEAKER_25]: Let's not get that twisted.

1666
02:44:05,766 --> 02:44:09,949
[SPEAKER_25]: Although I don't know about Loki's sex life, the guy's cute enough, but that's another story too.

1667
02:44:10,470 --> 02:44:12,471
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't say that shit while I've been drinking.

1668
02:44:13,952 --> 02:44:16,894
[SPEAKER_22]: We're fucking listening, so obviously you only caught the last half.

1669
02:44:17,755 --> 02:44:19,716
[SPEAKER_25]: I still want Gak's sexy body, but anyway.

1670
02:44:20,337 --> 02:44:22,138
[SPEAKER_25]: Uh, do I get to vote another one off now, or?

1671
02:44:23,979 --> 02:44:24,160
[SPEAKER_13]: Ow!

1672
02:44:25,681 --> 02:44:26,001
[SPEAKER_13]: Bitch.

1673
02:44:28,523 --> 02:44:29,003
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

1674
02:44:30,184 --> 02:44:32,726
[SPEAKER_03]: Chatroom, this is where you decide.

1675
02:44:33,957 --> 02:44:35,838
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, God, I didn't mean too loud.

1676
02:44:35,978 --> 02:44:37,278
[SPEAKER_03]: Too loud, I didn't mean too loud.

1677
02:44:39,058 --> 02:44:43,700
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, you've got a few minutes to send me your votes.

1678
02:44:44,780 --> 02:44:46,280
[SPEAKER_03]: If you don't send me your votes, I kill you!

1679
02:44:46,781 --> 02:44:47,881
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, wait, I don't kill you.

1680
02:44:47,901 --> 02:44:49,001
[SPEAKER_03]: You're so stupid!

1681
02:44:50,522 --> 02:44:56,523
[SPEAKER_03]: Send me your votes, and in the meantime, just to make Jahi happy, we're gonna play MC Hawking.

1682
02:44:56,983 --> 02:44:59,364
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, if you want MC Hawking to end,

1683
02:45:00,004 --> 02:45:03,245
[SPEAKER_03]: Send in your vote for best liquor.

1684
02:45:04,546 --> 02:45:07,247
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to re-read the list and I'm going to post it into the chat room.

1685
02:45:08,367 --> 02:45:09,167
[SPEAKER_03]: Just give me a second.

1686
02:45:09,207 --> 02:45:10,248
[SPEAKER_03]: God, I'm so uncoordinated.

1687
02:45:12,208 --> 02:45:14,569
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I stay vaguely coherent when I'm alcoholic.

1688
02:45:14,609 --> 02:45:15,009
[SPEAKER_03]: When I'm drunk.

1689
02:45:23,217 --> 02:45:25,158
[SPEAKER_03]: It won't let me paste it into the freaking chat room.

1690
02:45:25,778 --> 02:45:26,299
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, there we go.

1691
02:45:26,419 --> 02:45:26,779
[SPEAKER_03]: Damn.

1692
02:45:26,899 --> 02:45:27,119
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1693
02:45:28,540 --> 02:45:29,720
[SPEAKER_03]: So vote for one of those.

1694
02:45:30,761 --> 02:45:33,002
[SPEAKER_03]: You have, um, how long is this song?

1695
02:45:33,602 --> 02:45:34,303
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, shit.

1696
02:45:34,663 --> 02:45:36,424
[SPEAKER_03]: Three minutes and twenty-five seconds.

1697
02:45:37,124 --> 02:45:38,545
[SPEAKER_03]: Vote now, or die.

1698
02:45:38,565 --> 02:45:45,589
[SPEAKER_01]: Ah, yeah.

1699
02:45:45,789 --> 02:45:47,529
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right, motherfuckers.

1700
02:45:49,430 --> 02:45:51,552
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm back, riding a funky track.

1701
02:45:52,925 --> 02:45:55,847
[SPEAKER_01]: I got a story to tell you all, so listen up.

1702
02:45:57,307 --> 02:45:58,788
[SPEAKER_01]: Yo, trip on this.

1703
02:46:00,749 --> 02:46:02,830
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm rolling through the boat on a Saturday night.

1704
02:46:02,910 --> 02:46:10,054
[SPEAKER_01]: Got a 40 in my left hand, dick in my right, some cronk in my left, a pager in my hat, and a 9mm in the small of my back.

1705
02:46:10,194 --> 02:46:12,014
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just chilling no place to be.

1706
02:46:12,315 --> 02:46:14,416
[SPEAKER_01]: I take another blow off my 40Z.

1707
02:46:14,576 --> 02:46:16,837
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm thinking about skinning a fat ass tree.

1708
02:46:17,017 --> 02:46:18,698
[SPEAKER_01]: A B to the L to the U-N-T.

1709
02:46:19,338 --> 02:46:41,410
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I get a call on my dope cell phone, check the caller ID, plug up Holmes, yo it's the Doom and his news ain't good I feel like the world is fading away, I saw little Pookie just the other day, Pookie was my boy we shitted Kool-Aid in the park, now some punks took his life in the dark, I asked Doomsday who the motherfuckers be, some punk ass bitch from MIT

1710
02:46:42,310 --> 02:47:01,638
[SPEAKER_01]: The fucking Institute, man I should've known I say meet me at my crib and hang up the phone Playtime's over, I got a job to do And the world will be less crowded by the time I move And I'll keep rolling while bullets fly Cause all my shootings be drive-bys Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't drop bars Don't, don't, don't, don't drop bars

1711
02:47:14,034 --> 02:47:40,607
[SPEAKER_01]: One minute to midnight, we hit the street, cold as a cadaver, hard as concrete Doomsday's hacking, Baby Mac got my AK-47 and the 9 in my bag The Alpine's blowing, PE's blowing, got my swerve on tight and my game face showing Them damn punks are gonna pay, the hawks on the case, a bird of prey Then up ahead, cold chilling in the street, 6 motherfuckers from MIT I flick off the safety, check my grip, and bloat

1712
02:47:41,207 --> 02:48:10,019
[SPEAKER_01]: A dumb dumb clip, I glance at the Doom to make sure he's hacked His fingers on the traitor of his baby mech Time to give a Newtonian demonstration Of a bullet, it's mass and it's acceleration Dying on my lap, AK in my hand I roll up slow, like a snake in the sand I wait till I'm sure they can see my face Then I bust out slugs to the beat of the bass Streets sketched out in the full moonlight MIT punks dying left and right There's nowhere to run, don't even try Cause all my shootings be drive-bys

1713
02:48:14,424 --> 02:48:14,986
[SPEAKER_07]: Broadbite

1714
02:48:30,683 --> 02:48:50,533
[SPEAKER_01]: Then silence hits the street like a bomb, and eerie calm like the eye of a storm Beneath the glow of an old streetlight, dab MIT punks in the only sight Six motherfuckers no longer alive, cookies in a bench, one for one plus five And we'll be long gone before the cops arrive, cause all my shootings being drive-bys Hi-ya!

1715
02:48:51,073 --> 02:48:54,535
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm busting more shit than an incontinent man at a chili cook-off

1716
02:48:55,934 --> 02:49:02,318
[SPEAKER_01]: The moral of the story is, don't fuck with the Hawkman, cause the Hawkman ain't dealt with an eye for an eye for shit.

1717
02:49:02,799 --> 02:49:03,579
[SPEAKER_01]: Fuck that.

1718
02:49:04,400 --> 02:49:07,162
[SPEAKER_01]: Take an eye, and I'll take your motherfucking head.

1719
02:49:24,568 --> 02:49:30,352
[SPEAKER_06]: Please listen to Orange Lounge Radio, because real radio makes Captain Jack cry.

1720
02:49:33,934 --> 02:49:36,915
[SPEAKER_17]: We're back.

1721
02:49:37,176 --> 02:49:38,256
[SPEAKER_03]: We almost have winners.

1722
02:49:38,616 --> 02:49:40,858
[SPEAKER_03]: In the meantime, though, we're going to give the microphone to Jackie to rant for a while.

1723
02:49:41,917 --> 02:49:42,477
[SPEAKER_25]: Cool.

1724
02:49:42,878 --> 02:49:43,838
[SPEAKER_25]: I get to rant.

1725
02:49:44,779 --> 02:49:45,579
[SPEAKER_25]: I don't know if it's a rant.

1726
02:49:45,599 --> 02:49:47,521
[SPEAKER_25]: They're discussing the alcohols right now.

1727
02:49:49,022 --> 02:49:50,262
[SPEAKER_25]: They're doing rock, paper, scissors.

1728
02:49:50,743 --> 02:49:51,943
[SPEAKER_25]: They're still making a decision.

1729
02:49:53,184 --> 02:49:55,426
[SPEAKER_25]: If we have an afterbirth tonight, I might kick some shit.

1730
02:49:55,466 --> 02:49:55,886
[SPEAKER_25]: I don't know.

1731
02:49:56,286 --> 02:49:57,987
[SPEAKER_25]: That was MC Hawking on the last track.

1732
02:49:58,007 --> 02:50:00,989
[SPEAKER_25]: One of the hardest motherfuckers I know with all my shootings being drive-bys.

1733
02:50:01,810 --> 02:50:03,271
[SPEAKER_25]: And I wouldn't fuck with him because he'll shoot you.

1734
02:50:04,291 --> 02:50:05,672
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, well we have our three winners.

1735
02:50:06,272 --> 02:50:06,773
[SPEAKER_03]: Number three...

1736
02:50:08,516 --> 02:50:11,458
[SPEAKER_03]: Godiva and Vanilla Soy Milk combo.

1737
02:50:11,558 --> 02:50:13,220
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to get another one right now.

1738
02:50:13,900 --> 02:50:17,063
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't drink up all the Godiva though.

1739
02:50:17,143 --> 02:50:19,765
[SPEAKER_03]: Second place is Smirnoff Vanilla Twist Alcohol.

1740
02:50:21,046 --> 02:50:23,007
[SPEAKER_03]: And number one is Godiva.

1741
02:50:23,748 --> 02:50:25,309
[SPEAKER_03]: Yay!

1742
02:50:25,329 --> 02:50:28,952
[SPEAKER_03]: None of those people had Vermeer.

1743
02:50:29,552 --> 02:50:31,193
[SPEAKER_03]: The Vermeer though is pretty kickass.

1744
02:50:31,273 --> 02:50:32,434
[SPEAKER_03]: I just couldn't think of how to say it.

1745
02:50:32,474 --> 02:50:33,395
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't want to misspell it.

1746
02:50:34,656 --> 02:50:35,416
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's me.

1747
02:50:38,277 --> 02:50:40,099
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, we've got two minutes left in the show.

1748
02:50:41,720 --> 02:50:42,140
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

1749
02:50:42,480 --> 02:50:43,922
[SPEAKER_03]: You had something you wanted to talk about, right?

1750
02:50:45,163 --> 02:50:45,663
[SPEAKER_22]: I guess.

1751
02:50:46,624 --> 02:50:49,026
[SPEAKER_22]: Uh, yeah, sum it up in a few seconds.

1752
02:50:49,506 --> 02:50:54,830
[SPEAKER_22]: Guy makes 2600 Atari game of DDR type thing.

1753
02:50:55,070 --> 02:50:55,831
[SPEAKER_22]: Sucks ass.

1754
02:50:56,031 --> 02:50:56,331
[SPEAKER_22]: The end.

1755
02:50:57,953 --> 02:50:59,154
[SPEAKER_03]: Do we know where this can be found?

1756
02:51:00,435 --> 02:51:00,635
[SPEAKER_22]: Nope.

1757
02:51:01,095 --> 02:51:01,936
[SPEAKER_22]: Can't remember offhand.

1758
02:51:03,396 --> 02:51:05,717
[SPEAKER_03]: You see that box there with the mushrooms on the lid?

1759
02:51:06,658 --> 02:51:14,822
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are 2600 ROMs and they're actually game chips and a thing to play them on a 2600.

1760
02:51:14,882 --> 02:51:15,023
[SPEAKER_03]: Cool.

1761
02:51:15,083 --> 02:51:20,025
[SPEAKER_03]: I think Custer's Revenge is in there somewhere.

1762
02:51:23,127 --> 02:51:23,547
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah.

1763
02:51:24,628 --> 02:51:26,089
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm real interested.

1764
02:51:27,129 --> 02:51:28,190
[SPEAKER_28]: Pixelated penis!

1765
02:51:29,505 --> 02:51:31,627
[SPEAKER_02]: Custer's Revenge is so funny.

1766
02:51:32,248 --> 02:51:32,608
[SPEAKER_02]: No!

1767
02:51:32,968 --> 02:51:33,969
[SPEAKER_02]: Custer's Revenge.

1768
02:51:34,950 --> 02:51:35,151
[SPEAKER_02]: For the 2600.

1769
02:51:35,351 --> 02:51:37,273
[SPEAKER_02]: The porn game.

1770
02:51:38,914 --> 02:51:41,497
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1771
02:51:42,318 --> 02:51:43,038
[SPEAKER_03]: Custer.

1772
02:51:43,699 --> 02:51:44,079
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway.

1773
02:51:47,042 --> 02:51:49,365
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you ever see the one called X-Man?

1774
02:51:50,426 --> 02:51:52,348
[SPEAKER_03]: It was this guy who was scissors.

1775
02:51:54,296 --> 02:51:55,997
[SPEAKER_03]: The Sky Running Through A Maze

1776
02:52:10,660 --> 02:52:12,681
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's like pixelated cock and everything.

1777
02:52:12,741 --> 02:52:15,442
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really, really scary and really wrong.

1778
02:52:16,123 --> 02:52:19,864
[SPEAKER_03]: And anyway, on the note of pixelated cock, I think that we should go ahead and end this bit of rain, right?

1779
02:52:19,884 --> 02:52:20,585
[SPEAKER_03]: Because you know what?

1780
02:52:21,345 --> 02:52:24,066
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think I'm going to do very well at a drunk show next time.

1781
02:52:24,106 --> 02:52:25,107
[SPEAKER_03]: We wait until Rob's here.

1782
02:52:25,807 --> 02:52:27,888
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I'll drink and let him be the sober one.

1783
02:52:27,928 --> 02:52:29,569
[SPEAKER_25]: Just give me the afterbirth part.

1784
02:52:29,869 --> 02:52:30,970
[SPEAKER_25]: Just give me the afterbirth part.

1785
02:52:30,990 --> 02:52:31,890
[SPEAKER_25]: That's disgusting.

1786
02:52:32,390 --> 02:52:34,611
[SPEAKER_25]: Well, yeah, but I can be disgusting.

1787
02:52:35,312 --> 02:52:38,313
[SPEAKER_03]: So why don't we go ahead and say our final thoughts for the evening, Loki?

1788
02:52:39,488 --> 02:52:41,230
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm tired and I need to work on my website.

1789
02:52:42,331 --> 02:52:42,852
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes you do.

1790
02:52:43,433 --> 02:52:43,773
[SPEAKER_28]: Melody.

1791
02:52:44,614 --> 02:52:44,934
[SPEAKER_28]: Catch.

1792
02:52:47,257 --> 02:52:50,601
[SPEAKER_28]: Sorry out there to all you people who just got like an ear full of futon.

1793
02:52:53,465 --> 02:52:53,725
Jahi.

1794
02:52:55,629 --> 02:52:58,371
[SPEAKER_25]: There's a certain someone I'm waiting to get me a call on Valentine's Day.

1795
02:52:58,411 --> 02:52:59,532
[SPEAKER_25]: Hope she calls me.

1796
02:53:00,053 --> 02:53:02,795
[SPEAKER_25]: Motherfuck Puff Daddy and a ton of other people in the industry.

1797
02:53:03,316 --> 02:53:04,296
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm bitter, goddammit.

1798
02:53:04,336 --> 02:53:05,157
[SPEAKER_25]: Fuck Walmart.

1799
02:53:05,217 --> 02:53:06,578
[SPEAKER_25]: Fuck a whole bunch of other people.

1800
02:53:07,099 --> 02:53:09,181
[SPEAKER_25]: Godiva and Soy Milk is really good.

1801
02:53:09,281 --> 02:53:14,765
[SPEAKER_25]: Thanks to Jamie for allowing me to speak on OrangeLounge.com.

1802
02:53:15,386 --> 02:53:18,268
[SPEAKER_25]: And that's it.

1803
02:53:19,469 --> 02:53:20,070
[SPEAKER_03]: Sadly enough...

1804
02:53:20,811 --> 02:53:23,393
[SPEAKER_03]: After, what, did I have like five or six drinks?

1805
02:53:24,374 --> 02:53:28,678
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm still not, I'm still not drunk that bad.

1806
02:53:29,599 --> 02:53:35,624
[SPEAKER_22]: Um, so... I wish I could go to the strip club, but that's a lot of money and I don't have the money.

1807
02:53:39,087 --> 02:53:39,447
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll go.

1808
02:53:39,467 --> 02:53:42,890
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so let's go ahead and end this train wreck.

1809
02:53:42,910 --> 02:53:45,993
[SPEAKER_03]: Stay tuned, though, for a special messy surprise.

1810
02:53:49,423 --> 02:53:52,485

1815
02:54:13,238 --> 02:54:14,979
[SPEAKER_08]: Yay, we're scared!

1816
