1
00:00:06,029 --> 00:00:09,513
[SPEAKER_16]: Do you want to hear the most annoying sound in the world?

2
00:00:11,515 --> 00:00:16,561
[SPEAKER_01]: You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio, the Monty Talk, and then some.

3
00:00:20,214 --> 00:00:23,096
[SPEAKER_01]: Orange Lounge may contain adult content.

4
00:00:23,456 --> 00:00:26,619
[SPEAKER_01]: Orange Lounge may contain many four-letter words.

5
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:29,921
[SPEAKER_01]: Orange Lounge may contain a scene of nudity.

6
00:00:30,461 --> 00:00:33,343
[SPEAKER_01]: Orange Lounge may contain hot monkey sex.

7
00:00:34,144 --> 00:00:34,564
[SPEAKER_27]: Just kidding.

8
00:00:34,744 --> 00:00:36,345
[SPEAKER_27]: Orange Lounge will not contain hot monkey sex.

9
00:00:36,565 --> 00:00:37,206
[SPEAKER_27]: In this episode...

10
00:00:42,765 --> 00:00:46,227
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry, but all questions must be submitted in writing.

11
00:00:46,247 --> 00:00:48,209
[SPEAKER_02]: Why did they have to take the word gay?

12
00:01:13,878 --> 00:01:16,339
[SPEAKER_18]: DarkSakura, Sky, Loki, Orange Lounge Radio,

13
00:01:39,529 --> 00:01:43,591
[SPEAKER_27]: We are live, and this is episode number 31 for February 2nd of 2003.

14
00:01:43,671 --> 00:01:49,393
[SPEAKER_27]: You're tuned into the Bomani Scene's most grounded radio station of all things B-Money.

15
00:01:50,034 --> 00:01:51,875
[SPEAKER_27]: My name is Rob Roberts, you might know me as Sky.

16
00:01:52,675 --> 00:01:54,636
[SPEAKER_27]: Joining me as always are my awesome co-hosts.

17
00:01:55,376 --> 00:01:59,018
[SPEAKER_27]: In the invisible corner is the happiest bunny on the farm, Miss Jamie Summers.

18
00:01:59,038 --> 00:02:01,199
[SPEAKER_27]: You know her better as DarkSakura.

19
00:02:01,239 --> 00:02:03,320
[SPEAKER_27]: She's running in here like a chicken with her head cut off.

20
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:03,740
[SPEAKER_27]: What's up?

21
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:06,141
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, okay, cool.

22
00:02:07,721 --> 00:02:07,982
[SPEAKER_10]: Did you?

23
00:02:08,022 --> 00:02:08,542
[SPEAKER_10]: Yay, thank you.

24
00:02:11,948 --> 00:02:12,188
[SPEAKER_27]: All right.

25
00:02:12,969 --> 00:02:15,370
[SPEAKER_27]: And you get... We have horrible mic noise again tonight.

26
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:17,911
[SPEAKER_27]: And I swear to God, I fixed this problem before the show started.

27
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:18,752
[SPEAKER_27]: It's pissing me off.

28
00:02:19,292 --> 00:02:19,972
[SPEAKER_27]: I'll see what I can do.

29
00:02:20,713 --> 00:02:21,873
[SPEAKER_27]: I'll see what I can do during the first break.

30
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:27,051
[SPEAKER_27]: Also, say hello to our other lovely co-host.

31
00:02:27,551 --> 00:02:29,052
[SPEAKER_27]: I should say more handsome co-host.

32
00:02:29,072 --> 00:02:30,232
[SPEAKER_27]: I don't think he likes to be called lovely.

33
00:02:30,592 --> 00:02:31,592
[SPEAKER_27]: Our handsome co-host.

34
00:02:31,972 --> 00:02:33,193
[SPEAKER_27]: Say hello to our tech master, Loki.

35
00:02:33,253 --> 00:02:33,673
[SPEAKER_27]: Hello.

36
00:02:35,514 --> 00:02:38,474
[SPEAKER_27]: Also with us tonight, we have a whole buffet of guests in studio.

37
00:02:38,534 --> 00:02:39,455
[SPEAKER_27]: Say hello to Brad.

38
00:02:39,675 --> 00:02:40,115
[SPEAKER_27]: Buffet.

39
00:02:40,295 --> 00:02:40,775
[SPEAKER_27]: Mmm.

40
00:02:41,135 --> 00:02:41,675
[SPEAKER_27]: And pancakes.

41
00:02:42,176 --> 00:02:45,717
[SPEAKER_27]: And we haven't had this gentleman on the show before, but say hello to Zero.

42
00:02:46,217 --> 00:02:46,797
[SPEAKER_13]: Hey, how's it going?

43
00:02:47,603 --> 00:02:50,404
[SPEAKER_27]: and also out in the other room playing Animal Crossing's Irene.

44
00:02:50,424 --> 00:02:52,584
[SPEAKER_27]: She probably won't be on the show because she always plays Animal Crossing.

45
00:02:52,704 --> 00:02:54,065
[SPEAKER_27]: Bitch!

46
00:02:55,365 --> 00:02:55,745
[SPEAKER_27]: Pancakes.

47
00:02:56,105 --> 00:02:56,545
[SPEAKER_27]: Pancakes.

48
00:02:57,586 --> 00:02:57,866
[SPEAKER_25]: What?

49
00:02:59,266 --> 00:03:05,188
[SPEAKER_25]: Dave, are you listening?

50
00:03:05,228 --> 00:03:06,128
[SPEAKER_25]: You should be over here right now.

51
00:03:06,148 --> 00:03:06,648
[SPEAKER_25]: I don't know.

52
00:03:06,668 --> 00:03:07,528
[SPEAKER_27]: That is a good question.

53
00:03:07,568 --> 00:03:08,849
[SPEAKER_27]: Where has Dave been?

54
00:03:09,009 --> 00:03:09,989
[SPEAKER_27]: He hasn't been here for a few weeks.

55
00:03:12,347 --> 00:03:13,867
[SPEAKER_26]: Where's Puppy and Tal?

56
00:03:14,007 --> 00:03:15,989
[SPEAKER_27]: Puppy and Tal are at Scandia.

57
00:03:16,069 --> 00:03:19,130
[SPEAKER_27]: They were there for Tal's birthday and they were supposed to be here by now.

58
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:21,071
[SPEAKER_26]: But they're not.

59
00:03:21,351 --> 00:03:23,032
[SPEAKER_27]: So that means punishment.

60
00:03:26,593 --> 00:03:27,494
[SPEAKER_27]: So, yeah.

61
00:03:28,394 --> 00:03:28,715
[SPEAKER_27]: Hello.

62
00:03:28,835 --> 00:03:30,636
[SPEAKER_27]: So, we're going to talk about a whole bunch of stuff tonight.

63
00:03:30,936 --> 00:03:35,140
[SPEAKER_27]: We have interviews from the tournament that happened on Friday at Milpitas, Milpitas Golf Land.

64
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:35,680
[SPEAKER_27]: We've got those.

65
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,802
[SPEAKER_27]: I know tons of you are just looking forward to that.

66
00:03:38,862 --> 00:03:42,365
[SPEAKER_27]: And we'll get to everything else a bit later, but first we're going to take a quick break.

67
00:03:43,006 --> 00:03:45,728
[SPEAKER_27]: And I thought we'd start off this first break with some...

68
00:03:47,849 --> 00:03:49,431
[SPEAKER_27]: Oh, any other opening thoughts from the folks here?

69
00:03:50,432 --> 00:03:51,653
[SPEAKER_27]: Oh, did the missing people just show up?

70
00:03:51,853 --> 00:03:52,594
[SPEAKER_27]: Oh, let's say hello to them.

71
00:03:52,814 --> 00:03:53,474
[SPEAKER_27]: Oh, there they are!

72
00:03:53,755 --> 00:03:54,355
[SPEAKER_22]: You're late!

73
00:03:54,575 --> 00:03:56,397
[SPEAKER_22]: You're late!

74
00:03:56,917 --> 00:03:57,198
[SPEAKER_27]: What's up?

75
00:03:57,238 --> 00:03:58,138
[SPEAKER_27]: Okay, we have Tau.

76
00:03:58,178 --> 00:03:58,739
[SPEAKER_27]: Say hello to Tau.

77
00:03:58,919 --> 00:03:59,359
[SPEAKER_22]: Hi.

78
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:00,781
[SPEAKER_27]: And then we have Puppy.

79
00:04:00,981 --> 00:04:01,541
[SPEAKER_02]: Puppy's here.

80
00:04:01,621 --> 00:04:01,962
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi.

81
00:04:03,443 --> 00:04:05,024
[SPEAKER_27]: And then, in the back, there's Ryan.

82
00:04:05,104 --> 00:04:06,045
[SPEAKER_27]: Oh, shut the fuck up.

83
00:04:07,629 --> 00:04:07,910
[SPEAKER_27]: What?

84
00:04:08,691 --> 00:04:11,113
[SPEAKER_22]: Shock of Duval, I don't know, you know what I mean, right?

85
00:04:11,254 --> 00:04:12,015
[SPEAKER_27]: Okay!

86
00:04:12,395 --> 00:04:13,196
[SPEAKER_27]: Shock of Duval!

87
00:04:13,376 --> 00:04:19,604
[SPEAKER_27]: Oh, I'm, uh, I received a message from the chatroom, snub, just once told me Dave is in Houston, visiting the grandparents.

88
00:04:19,644 --> 00:04:19,764
[SPEAKER_27]: Really?

89
00:04:19,784 --> 00:04:20,925
[SPEAKER_27]: That's where Dave is.

90
00:04:20,946 --> 00:04:22,387
[SPEAKER_27]: Well, we were asking where Dave is.

91
00:04:25,411 --> 00:04:26,492
[SPEAKER_27]: Dude, what the fuck is that?

92
00:04:26,512 --> 00:04:26,813
[SPEAKER_27]: What happened?

93
00:04:29,091 --> 00:04:30,492
[SPEAKER_27]: I heard a can of soda opened.

94
00:04:30,512 --> 00:04:34,835
[SPEAKER_22]: The Mountain Dew's not supposed to smell like that, yo.

95
00:04:37,016 --> 00:04:38,477
[SPEAKER_27]: It's always exciting here at Orange Mountain.

96
00:04:38,497 --> 00:04:39,818
[SPEAKER_19]: The Red Mountain Dew smells like a fart.

97
00:04:42,519 --> 00:04:42,839
[SPEAKER_27]: Alright.

98
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:44,761
[SPEAKER_27]: What the hell is this?

99
00:04:44,841 --> 00:04:45,321
[SPEAKER_27]: D&L?

100
00:04:46,562 --> 00:04:48,163
[SPEAKER_27]: It's 7 Up Upside Down.

101
00:04:48,183 --> 00:04:48,863
[SPEAKER_27]: What is this?

102
00:04:51,212 --> 00:04:59,336
[SPEAKER_22]: DNL is basically, it's like the opposite of 7up, as in the logo is upside down, and instead of being a green bottle with clear liquid, it's a clear bottle with green liquid inside.

103
00:05:00,277 --> 00:05:02,638
[SPEAKER_22]: It's caffeinated, instead of just being, like, fucking normal.

104
00:05:03,218 --> 00:05:06,600
[SPEAKER_22]: It tastes like 7up with a kick of Mountain Dew, and it's actually really good.

105
00:05:07,721 --> 00:05:09,622
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, but this shit I've been drinking, like, day and night.

106
00:05:09,642 --> 00:05:11,122
[SPEAKER_22]: It's, like, better than blue.

107
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:12,623
[SPEAKER_27]: It's okay.

108
00:05:14,544 --> 00:05:15,065
[SPEAKER_27]: It's okay.

109
00:05:15,205 --> 00:05:15,685
[SPEAKER_27]: It's alright.

110
00:05:16,465 --> 00:05:17,466
[SPEAKER_27]: Okay, we're gonna take a break now.

111
00:05:17,506 --> 00:05:19,647
[SPEAKER_27]: We'll come back and talk about all the, uh,

112
00:05:20,185 --> 00:05:21,566
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah, Surge was what I was going to say.

113
00:05:21,586 --> 00:05:22,127
[SPEAKER_27]: It's kind of like Surge.

114
00:05:22,147 --> 00:05:22,387
[SPEAKER_27]: Anyway.

115
00:05:22,727 --> 00:05:23,228
[SPEAKER_19]: I like Surge.

116
00:05:23,428 --> 00:05:24,089
[SPEAKER_19]: We'll take a quick break.

117
00:05:24,129 --> 00:05:24,929
[SPEAKER_19]: I hate knowing you.

118
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:34,598
[SPEAKER_27]: And we'll be back to talk about all sorts of fun things, get to those interviews, maybe play some of the money match games, some of our favorite stuff, and taking your calls.

119
00:05:34,918 --> 00:05:35,399
[SPEAKER_27]: Just kidding.

120
00:05:35,419 --> 00:05:36,199
[SPEAKER_27]: We still have the phone.

121
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:37,000
[SPEAKER_27]: We'll be back.

122
00:06:08,625 --> 00:06:09,710
Thanks for watching!

123
00:09:52,288 --> 00:09:53,529
[SPEAKER_27]: Orange Lounge Radio.

124
00:09:53,849 --> 00:09:56,010
[SPEAKER_27]: We put your thing down, flip it, and reverse it.

125
00:09:56,850 --> 00:10:06,434
[SPEAKER_27]: Hi, we're back, and you're listening to Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 31.

126
00:10:07,215 --> 00:10:07,735
[SPEAKER_27]: How you doing?

127
00:10:08,355 --> 00:10:09,616
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm eating a golden stream.

128
00:10:09,796 --> 00:10:11,817
[SPEAKER_27]: Mmm, you're munching on a golden stream, huh?

129
00:10:11,997 --> 00:10:14,558
[SPEAKER_19]: I didn't have my nuts today, so now I have my golden stream.

130
00:10:15,078 --> 00:10:15,358
[SPEAKER_27]: Yum.

131
00:10:15,398 --> 00:10:16,639
[SPEAKER_27]: Tell us about golden stream.

132
00:10:16,659 --> 00:10:17,099
[SPEAKER_27]: What is this?

133
00:10:17,579 --> 00:10:19,000
[SPEAKER_19]: It's a brand of trail fish.

134
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:22,941
[SPEAKER_19]: And I don't like the apricots with the raisins in it, so I'm eating everything else.

135
00:10:23,161 --> 00:10:23,562
[SPEAKER_27]: Ah, okay.

136
00:10:23,742 --> 00:10:25,642
[SPEAKER_27]: No apricots for you.

137
00:10:25,702 --> 00:10:26,363
[SPEAKER_27]: I love coconut.

138
00:10:27,563 --> 00:10:29,844
[SPEAKER_27]: Last night at TGI Fridays, I had the coconut chicken strips.

139
00:10:29,884 --> 00:10:30,144
[SPEAKER_27]: Yum.

140
00:10:30,624 --> 00:10:31,085
[SPEAKER_27]: Delicious.

141
00:10:31,985 --> 00:10:32,325
[SPEAKER_27]: Anyway.

142
00:10:32,345 --> 00:10:32,925
[SPEAKER_27]: What?

143
00:10:33,546 --> 00:10:34,666
[SPEAKER_27]: What are you giving me?

144
00:10:34,906 --> 00:10:35,726
[SPEAKER_27]: Ooh, I get coconut.

145
00:10:35,806 --> 00:10:36,467
[SPEAKER_27]: Mmm, yum, yum, yum.

146
00:10:37,967 --> 00:10:39,228
[SPEAKER_27]: Oh, happy birthday, Tao.

147
00:10:39,788 --> 00:10:40,468
[SPEAKER_27]: Yay.

148
00:10:41,068 --> 00:10:42,249
[SPEAKER_27]: How old are you now?

149
00:10:42,709 --> 00:10:42,829
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm 22.

150
00:10:42,949 --> 00:10:45,930
[SPEAKER_27]: And has anybody given you spankings yet?

151
00:10:47,031 --> 00:10:47,151
[SPEAKER_27]: Uh...

152
00:10:49,382 --> 00:10:50,562
[SPEAKER_27]: Is anyone giving you spanking chat?

153
00:10:50,782 --> 00:11:00,827
[SPEAKER_22]: Let's see, I was spanked in Beatmania, I was spanked in, uh, fucking playing Civilization the board game, I was spanked in Street Fighter, every game I played against other people yesterday I was spanked in, if that's what you mean.

154
00:11:03,248 --> 00:11:04,108
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah, sure, that's what I meant.

155
00:11:05,229 --> 00:11:06,309
[SPEAKER_27]: Well, open up your present.

156
00:11:06,429 --> 00:11:08,710
[SPEAKER_27]: Loki's given, given, uh, Tal a present here.

157
00:11:11,632 --> 00:11:14,133
[SPEAKER_22]: It's got, it's got tape on it, dude, I'm not that lead.

158
00:11:14,933 --> 00:11:15,834
[SPEAKER_10]: Use your nails, dammit.

159
00:11:17,646 --> 00:11:18,967
[SPEAKER_22]: Use your keys or something.

160
00:11:19,148 --> 00:11:27,915
[SPEAKER_10]: I have a knife, right here.

161
00:11:28,596 --> 00:11:29,397
[SPEAKER_19]: We have a holy shit.

162
00:11:29,417 --> 00:11:30,298
[SPEAKER_22]: Gee golly-ness.

163
00:11:31,619 --> 00:11:34,001
[SPEAKER_22]: Wow, there's like so much anime in here.

164
00:11:34,081 --> 00:11:39,306
[SPEAKER_22]: Wow, why are you still thinking that in my face?

165
00:11:39,326 --> 00:11:41,007
[SPEAKER_27]: Because we want to hear what you've got.

166
00:11:42,268 --> 00:11:43,910
[SPEAKER_22]: Name an anime and it's probably in here.

167
00:11:44,696 --> 00:11:49,221
[SPEAKER_22]: Or at least ones that haven't come out yet, like Noir and KKNJ, or I'm sorry, In America, his and hers.

168
00:11:49,942 --> 00:11:51,623
[SPEAKER_22]: Stupidest goddamn translation of a name ever.

169
00:11:52,685 --> 00:11:53,405
[SPEAKER_22]: Nuku Nuku!

170
00:11:54,326 --> 00:11:56,188
[SPEAKER_22]: Ooh, now what is this shit here?

171
00:11:57,690 --> 00:11:58,311
[SPEAKER_02]: What the hell?

172
00:11:58,351 --> 00:11:58,871
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes!

173
00:11:58,911 --> 00:12:00,673
[SPEAKER_02]: This thing is rad!

174
00:12:04,969 --> 00:12:09,093
[SPEAKER_22]: But the big box that it came in has got cool anime people on it and it looks tight.

175
00:12:09,113 --> 00:12:09,814
[SPEAKER_22]: You know what?

176
00:12:10,054 --> 00:12:10,294
[SPEAKER_22]: What?

177
00:12:10,615 --> 00:12:14,018
[SPEAKER_27]: Someone needs to bring Crossfire to this show and we're going to have a Crossfire tournament.

178
00:12:14,178 --> 00:12:17,141
[SPEAKER_26]: Alright, that game right there, that is Beyblade.

179
00:12:17,261 --> 00:12:18,403
[SPEAKER_26]: It's Fighting Tops.

180
00:12:18,483 --> 00:12:23,027
[SPEAKER_26]: Can you believe that they made an anime about people fighting tops?

181
00:12:24,148 --> 00:12:25,769
[SPEAKER_26]: It's the most retarded thing ever.

182
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:28,331
[SPEAKER_22]: You believe this chick has missile boobs.

183
00:12:28,772 --> 00:12:33,375
[SPEAKER_22]: No, allow me to read the back of the Beyblade DVD.

184
00:12:33,776 --> 00:12:38,079
[SPEAKER_22]: As a young Beyblader, Tyson has a dream to be the best blader in the world.

185
00:12:38,539 --> 00:12:44,464
[SPEAKER_22]: Feeling confident with his technique, Tyson decides to challenge Kai, the leader of the undefeated Blade Sharks.

186
00:12:44,924 --> 00:12:45,965
[SPEAKER_19]: Did they challenge God?

187
00:12:46,465 --> 00:12:46,845
[SPEAKER_22]: Kai.

188
00:12:47,045 --> 00:12:47,225
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh.

189
00:12:48,066 --> 00:12:49,786
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, so now they have a Digimon character in here.

190
00:12:49,887 --> 00:12:50,087
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

191
00:12:50,827 --> 00:12:53,708
[SPEAKER_22]: Unfortunately, Tyson is crushed by the awesome power of Kai's blue blade.

192
00:12:54,369 --> 00:12:57,690
[SPEAKER_22]: Vowing revenge, he begins his quest to rebuild his Beyblade.

193
00:12:57,790 --> 00:12:59,691
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh my god, this is the fruitiest goddamn thing ever.

194
00:13:04,454 --> 00:13:05,954
[SPEAKER_27]: Yes, we did talk about GoldenStream.

195
00:13:06,795 --> 00:13:09,376
[SPEAKER_27]: So, why is it that, like, all you Bomani freaks are into anime?

196
00:13:10,945 --> 00:13:13,486
[SPEAKER_22]: Why is it all the anime freaks turned into Bimani is what you mean, right?

197
00:13:14,146 --> 00:13:15,106
[SPEAKER_22]: We were here first.

198
00:13:18,868 --> 00:13:23,369
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, I mean, it's like, um... What the hell is Black Lion?

199
00:13:23,409 --> 00:13:24,149
[SPEAKER_22]: I haven't even looked at it yet.

200
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:25,950
[SPEAKER_25]: You don't know Black Lion?

201
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:28,591
[SPEAKER_25]: Man, old school.

202
00:13:29,091 --> 00:13:30,572
[SPEAKER_25]: Well, not really old school, but it's still pretty old.

203
00:13:30,592 --> 00:13:35,673
[SPEAKER_26]: You know, if you'd only entered the edit contest, you would've probably won that.

204
00:13:36,234 --> 00:13:37,174
[SPEAKER_26]: What edit contest?

205
00:13:38,975 --> 00:13:40,275
[SPEAKER_26]: The one that was on Friday?

206
00:13:41,489 --> 00:13:42,410
[SPEAKER_26]: The one that you missed?

207
00:13:42,570 --> 00:13:45,111
[SPEAKER_26]: I went to go play TDX, my headache was.

208
00:13:45,432 --> 00:13:45,872
[SPEAKER_25]: Whatever.

209
00:13:47,033 --> 00:13:47,473
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm sorry.

210
00:13:48,013 --> 00:13:48,454
[SPEAKER_25]: Sheesh.

211
00:13:49,014 --> 00:13:49,774
[SPEAKER_25]: I can't make edits.

212
00:13:49,834 --> 00:13:52,796
[SPEAKER_25]: My edits are like... My edits are like the Monty Ruler edits.

213
00:13:52,816 --> 00:13:53,337
[SPEAKER_25]: They're crappy.

214
00:13:53,357 --> 00:13:55,018
[SPEAKER_19]: If I make you an edit, you give me some porn.

215
00:13:57,059 --> 00:13:58,019
[SPEAKER_25]: Uh, okay.

216
00:13:58,180 --> 00:14:02,202
Yeah, there you go.

217
00:14:02,802 --> 00:14:03,083
[SPEAKER_19]: Rob.

218
00:14:03,883 --> 00:14:04,103
[SPEAKER_19]: Rob.

219
00:14:04,123 --> 00:14:04,944
[SPEAKER_27]: Rob, put this in your butt.

220
00:14:05,724 --> 00:14:06,245
[SPEAKER_27]: Hi, what's up?

221
00:14:07,265 --> 00:14:08,826
[SPEAKER_27]: Sorry, I'm trying to work on that sound problem.

222
00:14:08,866 --> 00:14:09,967
[SPEAKER_19]: Nice hosting job, Rob.

223
00:14:10,737 --> 00:14:16,479
[SPEAKER_27]: We've got background issues today, so I'm trying to get rid of some of that background noise for you guys listening.

224
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:18,199
[SPEAKER_19]: Does everyone else hear it?

225
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:20,180
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah, I hear it a little bit.

226
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:28,442
[SPEAKER_27]: They're also having a little bit of a hard time hearing you, Jamie, so you've got to give head.

227
00:14:28,962 --> 00:14:29,362
[SPEAKER_19]: How's that?

228
00:14:29,382 --> 00:14:31,343
[SPEAKER_19]: Is that better?

229
00:14:31,663 --> 00:14:34,144
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm going to turn down our volume a little bit so that...

230
00:14:36,892 --> 00:14:41,456
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm going to turn down our mic volume, but everybody's going to have to talk super loud or they're not going to be able to hear you, so we'll go down a little bit.

231
00:14:41,477 --> 00:14:42,377
[SPEAKER_19]: That's not a problem.

232
00:14:42,558 --> 00:14:42,918
[SPEAKER_27]: All right.

233
00:14:43,979 --> 00:14:44,439
[SPEAKER_27]: Beautiful.

234
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,822
[SPEAKER_27]: Let's talk to the person that hasn't ever been here before.

235
00:14:47,482 --> 00:14:47,903
[SPEAKER_23]: Oh, great.

236
00:14:48,083 --> 00:14:48,884
[SPEAKER_27]: What's up, Zero?

237
00:14:49,244 --> 00:14:49,745
[SPEAKER_23]: Nothing much.

238
00:14:50,105 --> 00:14:51,807
[SPEAKER_27]: So what brings you here to the studio tonight?

239
00:14:52,247 --> 00:14:53,348
[SPEAKER_23]: You invited me last week.

240
00:14:53,628 --> 00:14:54,109
[SPEAKER_23]: Oh, yeah.

241
00:14:55,510 --> 00:14:58,313
[SPEAKER_22]: So how did you get... Isn't Zero X old?

242
00:14:59,854 --> 00:15:00,235
[SPEAKER_22]: What do you mean?

243
00:15:01,089 --> 00:15:01,469
[SPEAKER_22]: Wait a minute!

244
00:15:17,853 --> 00:15:18,434
[SPEAKER_23]: I feel great now.

245
00:15:18,854 --> 00:15:21,576
[SPEAKER_27]: So how did you get into this whole stupid arrow smashing game?

246
00:15:22,597 --> 00:15:27,341
[SPEAKER_23]: Um, found it one day when I was on a vacation down in Santa Cruz, then heard RPG all night.

247
00:15:27,421 --> 00:15:29,403
[SPEAKER_27]: Oh god, you started playing at the boardwalk?

248
00:15:29,623 --> 00:15:30,043
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah.

249
00:15:30,304 --> 00:15:30,924
[SPEAKER_23]: Oh shit.

250
00:15:30,944 --> 00:15:31,905
[SPEAKER_23]: The worst of the world.

251
00:15:32,025 --> 00:15:33,466
[SPEAKER_19]: Isn't that where they film The Lost Boys?

252
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:34,787
[SPEAKER_23]: Yep, it sure is.

253
00:15:35,988 --> 00:15:38,551
[SPEAKER_19]: My, um, one of my fiance's friends is a DJ there.

254
00:15:38,931 --> 00:15:39,171
[SPEAKER_23]: Really?

255
00:15:39,191 --> 00:15:39,612
[SPEAKER_23]: DJ Trip.

256
00:15:40,372 --> 00:15:40,672
[SPEAKER_23]: Heard.

257
00:15:41,493 --> 00:15:43,275
[SPEAKER_23]: I haven't, like, heard of him, but I've heard.

258
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:54,849
[SPEAKER_23]: Anyways, yeah, I started playing there, and then I heard, like, the horrible-ass RBGL had it, so I started playing there when it was good, and then... Well, it wasn't horrible-ass back when we started.

259
00:15:54,869 --> 00:15:58,572
[SPEAKER_23]: Not back then, but nowadays, that's why I said it was good back then.

260
00:15:58,692 --> 00:16:00,934
[SPEAKER_27]: 23rd Magus had a funny new nickname for Roseville Golf Line.

261
00:16:00,954 --> 00:16:03,116
[SPEAKER_27]: Could you post that in the chatroom so I can read it, because it was funny.

262
00:16:04,795 --> 00:16:10,339
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, I mean, RBGL, when we started, dude, it had, like, you know, the fourth mix, the USA and stuff, and it was fun to play.

263
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:16,542
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean, like, the first time I saw Kick the Can doubles, it was like, oh my god, there's someone playing doubles, and it's Kick the Can, hardest song ever.

264
00:16:17,103 --> 00:16:17,683
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah, I know.

265
00:16:17,983 --> 00:16:32,092
[SPEAKER_22]: But, you know, things happen, and people change, and then they get Max, and instead of getting our fourth plus or our fifth mix, and then they get Max 2, and we still have the USA and Max 2, and they get, what is it now, fourth plus and Extreme?

266
00:16:32,192 --> 00:16:32,332
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah.

267
00:16:35,218 --> 00:16:35,619
[SPEAKER_27]: Who cares?

268
00:16:35,679 --> 00:16:36,419
[SPEAKER_27]: I don't follow that crap.

269
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:50,912
[SPEAKER_27]: Of course, I got yelled at on... Because, you know, there's been kind of in the Sacramento community, and Orange Launch World Headquarters happens to be in Sacramento, and I know there's a lot of you not in Sacramento listening, but of course, if you listen to this show enough, you've kept up on Sacramento politics, because all we ever do is bitch.

270
00:16:51,453 --> 00:16:53,054
[SPEAKER_27]: That's what we're best at.

271
00:16:54,515 --> 00:16:57,898
[SPEAKER_27]: A lot of us are boycotting Rosso Golf Land because we're sick of their shit and they don't upgrade their games.

272
00:16:58,018 --> 00:17:00,460
[SPEAKER_27]: I got bitched at on DDR Freak because I...

273
00:17:01,221 --> 00:17:02,642
[SPEAKER_27]: Subtitles by the Amara.org community

274
00:17:18,849 --> 00:17:20,350
[SPEAKER_27]: You know, how am I going to pass up DDR?

275
00:17:20,430 --> 00:17:21,491
[SPEAKER_26]: It's like this, okay?

276
00:17:21,511 --> 00:17:25,174
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm going to go to Golf Land because I have tons of tokens I bought down in Impetus Golf Land.

277
00:17:25,234 --> 00:17:29,158
[SPEAKER_26]: No, I'm not going to drive two hours to go spend these tokens at another Golf Land.

278
00:17:29,218 --> 00:17:30,999
[SPEAKER_26]: They can go, you know, kiss my ass for that.

279
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:32,921
[SPEAKER_26]: I already spent the money at Golf Land.

280
00:17:32,941 --> 00:17:34,342
[SPEAKER_26]: Golf Land already has my money.

281
00:17:35,003 --> 00:17:36,084
[SPEAKER_26]: It would be a waste if I didn't.

282
00:17:36,104 --> 00:17:38,265
[SPEAKER_22]: That's exactly what my point of view is.

283
00:17:38,285 --> 00:17:43,049
[SPEAKER_22]: Like, if I've still got tokens at Golf Land, you know, there's a Drum Mania machine there that works on occasion.

284
00:17:43,390 --> 00:17:46,012
[SPEAKER_22]: And when it works, I can pump tokens in and, you know, fuck it up and then leave.

285
00:17:46,877 --> 00:17:55,744
[SPEAKER_19]: I've used up all mine, and now that my car is tested and fixed and everything, I'm going to be heading my butt to Milpitas to play the horsey racing game.

286
00:17:56,665 --> 00:18:06,032
[SPEAKER_27]: Speaking of Golfland and Milpitas Golfland, if you're just joining us, we do have the interviews from Milpitas Tournament that took place on Friday, and we'll get to those a little later when we're ready.

287
00:18:07,213 --> 00:18:07,713
[SPEAKER_19]: Whatever.

288
00:18:08,394 --> 00:18:09,154
[SPEAKER_27]: Let's talk more to Zero.

289
00:18:10,595 --> 00:18:13,538
[SPEAKER_27]: So, are you a PA or a freestyler?

290
00:18:13,918 --> 00:18:14,518
[SPEAKER_23]: Freestyler.

291
00:18:14,538 --> 00:18:14,979
[SPEAKER_23]: I wanted like 50.

292
00:18:16,973 --> 00:18:18,494
[SPEAKER_27]: So what kind of freestyle do you do?

293
00:18:19,134 --> 00:18:20,074
[SPEAKER_27]: Here's the next big question then.

294
00:18:20,114 --> 00:18:21,974
[SPEAKER_27]: Are you an improver or a routiner?

295
00:18:23,595 --> 00:18:26,435
[SPEAKER_23]: I would kind of say more routine than improv.

296
00:18:26,655 --> 00:18:27,875
[SPEAKER_23]: Just because it's stuff I know.

297
00:18:28,015 --> 00:18:32,396
[SPEAKER_23]: I freestyle what you guys all call like 18, like all the old stuff.

298
00:18:32,556 --> 00:18:33,757
[SPEAKER_23]: Oh, you're old school.

299
00:18:33,997 --> 00:18:34,317
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah.

300
00:18:34,377 --> 00:18:34,877
[SPEAKER_27]: That's cool.

301
00:18:35,097 --> 00:18:36,497
[SPEAKER_27]: So you like to like rate bars?

302
00:18:36,917 --> 00:18:38,417
[SPEAKER_27]: No, I don't touch the bar.

303
00:18:38,818 --> 00:18:39,118
[SPEAKER_27]: Really?

304
00:18:39,178 --> 00:18:40,878
[SPEAKER_27]: How do you do 18 freestyle without touching the bar?

305
00:18:43,405 --> 00:18:47,167
[SPEAKER_22]: See, A-Team is all about the bar and the knees, bro.

306
00:18:47,407 --> 00:18:48,427
[SPEAKER_22]: Bar, knees, and hands.

307
00:18:48,488 --> 00:18:51,289
[SPEAKER_22]: I do knees, I do everything else, but I don't touch the bar.

308
00:18:51,369 --> 00:18:59,732
[SPEAKER_22]: Dude, today I saw Loki doing his XC edit again, and he did the little freeze bit and then dropped his knees down, and you could just see his face just go like, oh, motherfuck.

309
00:18:59,892 --> 00:19:05,355
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah, it's like my thing, I mean, like when it comes to swinging my knees, my legs over the bar and stuff, I just don't touch the bar when I spin.

310
00:19:05,435 --> 00:19:05,835
[SPEAKER_23]: That's it.

311
00:19:06,015 --> 00:19:06,675
[SPEAKER_23]: Because I hate the bar.

312
00:19:07,256 --> 00:19:08,836
[SPEAKER_23]: The bar is icky and slimy.

313
00:19:09,296 --> 00:19:10,377
[SPEAKER_23]: Because everyone else does it.

314
00:19:10,859 --> 00:19:20,045
[SPEAKER_27]: I know, and everybody's, like, all sweating because they're playing DR, and then their little mitts are all over the bar, and then they have, like, a lot of bars have those little black padding things on them that just soak up all that crap.

315
00:19:20,065 --> 00:19:21,926
[SPEAKER_23]: I watched a guy wipe his head on those bars.

316
00:19:22,507 --> 00:19:23,107
[SPEAKER_23]: Oh, gross.

317
00:19:23,127 --> 00:19:24,668
[SPEAKER_23]: That's why, I don't, that's the reason I don't touch them.

318
00:19:25,609 --> 00:19:29,171
[SPEAKER_25]: I once put them between my legs and I rode them, and it was good.

319
00:19:29,251 --> 00:19:31,232
[SPEAKER_25]: And that's why we don't touch the bars.

320
00:19:32,053 --> 00:19:33,474
[SPEAKER_19]: I saw someone get nutted on one.

321
00:19:35,255 --> 00:19:37,876
[SPEAKER_19]: We were there for that, when Rick flipped Timmy.

322
00:19:37,896 --> 00:19:38,257
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, yeah.

323
00:19:40,054 --> 00:19:43,317
[SPEAKER_27]: I got that nickname for Roseville Golf Land, by the way, from 23 Magus.

324
00:19:43,357 --> 00:19:45,718
[SPEAKER_27]: He's calling it Runny Venereal Goo Land.

325
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:47,480
[SPEAKER_23]: That was pretty good.

326
00:19:50,182 --> 00:19:50,822
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah, haha.

327
00:19:51,183 --> 00:19:51,883
[SPEAKER_27]: We're so mature.

328
00:19:53,104 --> 00:19:53,945
[SPEAKER_27]: Did you hear that one, Jamie?

329
00:19:54,585 --> 00:19:55,646
[SPEAKER_27]: Runny Venereal Goo Land.

330
00:19:58,709 --> 00:20:02,511
[SPEAKER_10]: That made me smile.

331
00:20:03,612 --> 00:20:08,056
[SPEAKER_27]: USFVB, I have to ask a question to this, because this is kind of a running question about freestyle on the show.

332
00:20:08,846 --> 00:20:14,591
[SPEAKER_27]: Zero, why is it that throughout all the routines that we've seen, nobody ever whips their cock out at the end?

333
00:20:15,732 --> 00:20:19,295
[SPEAKER_23]: I think somebody would probably call the police or something if you get kicked out.

334
00:20:20,015 --> 00:20:24,259
[SPEAKER_22]: You know, it's a whole thing of the pants you wear to DDR just don't come down so quickly.

335
00:20:24,579 --> 00:20:26,681
[SPEAKER_22]: If they came down quickly, you'd fall over yourself.

336
00:20:26,821 --> 00:20:27,242
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't know.

337
00:20:27,282 --> 00:20:29,063
[SPEAKER_19]: Depending on the cock, I'd give them a high score.

338
00:20:30,404 --> 00:20:31,585
[SPEAKER_19]: That's probably why most people don't do it.

339
00:20:31,605 --> 00:20:34,848
[SPEAKER_22]: You know, there's a lot of people who say that there's a lot of gay people in the DDR community.

340
00:20:34,868 --> 00:20:35,669
[SPEAKER_22]: This is probably why.

341
00:20:40,659 --> 00:20:47,981
[SPEAKER_27]: If there's girls that can get up there and push their boobs together and call it a routine, then you know.

342
00:20:48,441 --> 00:20:49,161
[SPEAKER_27]: Last message.

343
00:20:54,163 --> 00:20:58,204
[SPEAKER_27]: That was all inspired because the OSFBB was suggesting that someone could whip their cock out and rub it on the bar.

344
00:20:58,884 --> 00:20:59,724
[SPEAKER_23]: That would be sick.

345
00:21:00,064 --> 00:21:01,084
[SPEAKER_27]: That would be bar raping.

346
00:21:01,185 --> 00:21:02,605
[SPEAKER_23]: Another reason you don't touch the bar.

347
00:21:03,345 --> 00:21:05,145
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh my god, that's so true.

348
00:21:05,165 --> 00:21:07,846
[SPEAKER_22]: I have little mini bars running around soon.

349
00:21:08,446 --> 00:21:10,186
[SPEAKER_22]: But, damn, dude.

350
00:21:10,866 --> 00:21:19,808
[SPEAKER_27]: Wouldn't it be funny if somebody got up there to do a routine and then, like, you know, whipped out, like, a cooler with all this liquor in it and said, look, I'm holding on to the bar.

351
00:21:21,808 --> 00:21:22,469
[SPEAKER_23]: That was interesting.

352
00:21:22,489 --> 00:21:22,849
[SPEAKER_27]: The bar?

353
00:21:23,629 --> 00:21:24,509
[SPEAKER_23]: Yes, I get it.

354
00:21:26,276 --> 00:21:27,537
[SPEAKER_22]: That's when you hit gongs.

355
00:21:32,798 --> 00:21:34,859
[SPEAKER_22]: I want to do an episode of Orange Lounge with a gong.

356
00:21:36,299 --> 00:21:38,780
[SPEAKER_22]: Dude, we would be fucking whacking that thing left and right.

357
00:21:40,601 --> 00:21:41,681
[SPEAKER_27]: No little gong either.

358
00:21:41,741 --> 00:21:45,502
[SPEAKER_27]: I want to wheel a giant gong in here and put it in the back.

359
00:21:46,683 --> 00:21:47,983
[SPEAKER_26]: We actually have one at our work.

360
00:21:48,083 --> 00:21:51,524
[SPEAKER_26]: Every time someone gets a new customer, they hit the gong.

361
00:21:51,664 --> 00:21:52,444
[SPEAKER_26]: I kid you not.

362
00:21:52,664 --> 00:21:54,125
[SPEAKER_26]: You can talk on the phone and it's sitting in your ears.

363
00:21:56,158 --> 00:21:56,558
[SPEAKER_26]: What was that?

364
00:21:56,578 --> 00:21:57,799
[SPEAKER_26]: What are you talking about?

365
00:21:57,819 --> 00:21:58,439
[SPEAKER_26]: I didn't hear anything.

366
00:21:58,979 --> 00:21:59,620
[SPEAKER_26]: It's hilarious.

367
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:09,004
[SPEAKER_22]: Speaking of which, tonight I'm going to be uploading a few pictures from Orange Lounge Radio because of the fact that I've got my digital camera here and I've got a website that was given to me nicely enough.

368
00:22:09,284 --> 00:22:11,125
[SPEAKER_13]: Why don't you whore out that site?

369
00:22:11,205 --> 00:22:12,766
[SPEAKER_22]: Not yet because it's not up yet.

370
00:22:14,147 --> 00:22:17,068
[SPEAKER_22]: I'll let you guys know by next week when all my shit is up and ready.

371
00:22:18,029 --> 00:22:21,750
[SPEAKER_22]: I believe Jamie is pulling her eye down and sticking her tongue at me in the Anime Girl fashion.

372
00:22:21,770 --> 00:22:22,731
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm not sure why, though.

373
00:22:26,897 --> 00:22:30,798
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah, I'll get around to mine when I get around to mine.

374
00:22:30,818 --> 00:22:32,739
[SPEAKER_26]: No more deadlines.

375
00:22:33,079 --> 00:22:37,921
[SPEAKER_26]: I don't like being imposed, you know, all these deadlines enforced on me.

376
00:22:38,381 --> 00:22:39,922
[SPEAKER_26]: They'll come up whenever, you know.

377
00:22:39,942 --> 00:22:46,505
[SPEAKER_22]: But yeah, I'm going to take like a handful of pictures because I've been taking pictures for my whole birthday weekend in Chitton, so I figure if I grab a few from here, I'll stick them on there.

378
00:22:47,786 --> 00:22:51,228
[SPEAKER_27]: Besides, what was I going to ask?

379
00:22:51,408 --> 00:22:57,452
[SPEAKER_27]: We've been getting a lot of listeners through that Leech from Loki site, so where are you advertising that site besides this show?

380
00:22:57,732 --> 00:22:59,553
[SPEAKER_27]: Because you're already getting a lot of hits, apparently.

381
00:23:00,814 --> 00:23:03,216
[SPEAKER_26]: Everyone that emails me goes, why aren't you updating your site?

382
00:23:03,476 --> 00:23:04,217
[SPEAKER_26]: Because there's a new site.

383
00:23:06,030 --> 00:23:08,171
[SPEAKER_27]: Oh, you know what?

384
00:23:08,251 --> 00:23:11,513
[SPEAKER_27]: Did you hear that I started a new sim file, even though I haven't finished the old one?

385
00:23:11,673 --> 00:23:12,274
[SPEAKER_27]: What'd you start?

386
00:23:12,654 --> 00:23:12,994
[SPEAKER_27]: A new one.

387
00:23:13,014 --> 00:23:14,175
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm not going to tell you what song.

388
00:23:14,735 --> 00:23:17,257
[SPEAKER_27]: But, you know, I'll tell you what song off air.

389
00:23:17,317 --> 00:23:21,579
[SPEAKER_26]: Well, obviously the listeners will know later on, but I did a remix today.

390
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:23,421
[SPEAKER_27]: Ah, yes, we're going to hear that, huh?

391
00:23:23,701 --> 00:23:24,681
[SPEAKER_26]: Yes.

392
00:23:24,841 --> 00:23:26,703
[SPEAKER_26]: And there might be a wicked sim file to go with that.

393
00:23:29,704 --> 00:23:31,205
[SPEAKER_26]: Well, you'll have to listen to it.

394
00:23:32,546 --> 00:23:33,867
[SPEAKER_27]: You'll find out, won't you, little boy?

395
00:23:35,495 --> 00:23:37,215
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah, okay.

396
00:23:37,756 --> 00:23:39,556
[SPEAKER_26]: Hey, why don't you give us a sim update, Loki?

397
00:23:40,596 --> 00:23:42,877
[SPEAKER_26]: Well, I wish there was something to update on.

398
00:23:43,477 --> 00:23:44,817
[SPEAKER_26]: There really isn't much going on.

399
00:23:44,837 --> 00:23:45,778
[SPEAKER_26]: Let's see here.

400
00:23:45,838 --> 00:23:48,138
[SPEAKER_26]: BomaniStyle, DJ Paranoia's taking a break.

401
00:23:48,158 --> 00:23:51,599
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm putting up the DDR Extreme files because he's tired.

402
00:23:52,139 --> 00:23:53,099
[SPEAKER_26]: I can understand that.

403
00:23:54,220 --> 00:23:54,440
[SPEAKER_25]: What?

404
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:58,441
[SPEAKER_25]: Do you know what happened to the DDR Extreme files that were on BomaniStyle?

405
00:23:58,461 --> 00:23:58,901
[SPEAKER_25]: They're gone.

406
00:24:00,071 --> 00:24:05,254
[SPEAKER_26]: They're re-uploading them with backgrounds and sync steps and full steps and that kind of thing.

407
00:24:06,175 --> 00:24:11,818
[SPEAKER_26]: But if you're looking for DDR Extreme stuff, there's some people are uploading stuff to BimaniSims.com.

408
00:24:11,838 --> 00:24:12,839
[SPEAKER_26]: You can find stuff there.

409
00:24:13,879 --> 00:24:19,623
[SPEAKER_26]: It's kind of like another site that was doing the exact same thing as I was doing, which is going to have people being able to upload their own files.

410
00:24:19,643 --> 00:24:23,405
[SPEAKER_26]: Of course, it's kind of very basic, and they just have a CGI script, which you can do stuff.

411
00:24:23,585 --> 00:24:28,008
[SPEAKER_26]: Of course, I'm going to be making full, beautiful web pages as soon as I get my site up.

412
00:24:29,486 --> 00:24:30,807
[SPEAKER_22]: Sure you are.

413
00:24:32,447 --> 00:24:33,007
[SPEAKER_26]: I am.

414
00:24:33,107 --> 00:24:38,389
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm just working on downloading, uh, er, I'm working on sorting 2,000 files, you know.

415
00:24:38,569 --> 00:24:39,630
[SPEAKER_26]: It's kind of difficult.

416
00:24:40,150 --> 00:24:47,253
[SPEAKER_22]: Simply, you just put them in, um, alphabetic order by, um, game and song and artist and... No, it's not gonna work.

417
00:24:47,373 --> 00:24:49,674
[SPEAKER_22]: ...and BPM and... What did you do?

418
00:24:50,694 --> 00:24:56,196
[SPEAKER_22]: Jamie's been taking random pics with my digicam, and from... She... Oh, my God, she's doing the dancer pose.

419
00:24:56,256 --> 00:24:56,876
[SPEAKER_22]: It's so... Hey.

420
00:24:57,256 --> 00:24:58,157
[SPEAKER_22]: Ha ha ha.

421
00:25:00,323 --> 00:25:01,524
[SPEAKER_22]: Hey, that's not a bad picture.

422
00:25:01,564 --> 00:25:02,044
[SPEAKER_22]: That's pretty good.

423
00:25:02,084 --> 00:25:03,365
[SPEAKER_26]: There's some cool stuff I got.

424
00:25:04,226 --> 00:25:06,888
[SPEAKER_26]: Like, last night I got the Axifoli Techno theme.

425
00:25:06,908 --> 00:25:09,629
[SPEAKER_26]: That was kind of funny.

426
00:25:09,810 --> 00:25:10,070
[SPEAKER_27]: DWI 2.40?

427
00:25:11,170 --> 00:25:11,731
[SPEAKER_27]: Did that come out?

428
00:25:12,233 --> 00:25:16,275
[SPEAKER_26]: Well, it might have, but I don't use DWI anymore, so that means nothing to me.

429
00:25:16,695 --> 00:25:16,955
[SPEAKER_26]: Oh, okay.

430
00:25:16,995 --> 00:25:21,037
[SPEAKER_26]: But for those who do, there's, like, been new DWI versions coming out.

431
00:25:21,057 --> 00:25:28,941
[SPEAKER_26]: There's actually some... Actually, DWI now supports Winamp plugins, I believe, for, you know, visualizations and that kind of shit.

432
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:30,441
[SPEAKER_26]: So that's out.

433
00:25:30,481 --> 00:25:34,223
[SPEAKER_26]: Plus, you know, they've been supporting, you know, lyrics for a while, which is kind of cool.

434
00:25:34,543 --> 00:25:35,704
[SPEAKER_26]: Then there's going to be the new version...

435
00:25:36,724 --> 00:25:40,447
[SPEAKER_26]: There's going to be the new Step Mania that they're working on right now.

436
00:25:40,487 --> 00:25:43,850
[SPEAKER_26]: It's going to be supporting what's done in QDX and Beatmania.

437
00:25:44,971 --> 00:25:48,313
[SPEAKER_22]: Dude, if you haven't played Be Lovin' on Xtreme, you've got to play it.

438
00:25:48,454 --> 00:25:49,755
[SPEAKER_22]: Greatest fucking song ever.

439
00:25:49,955 --> 00:25:52,817
[SPEAKER_26]: Oh my god, play Be Lovin' at the commercial break.

440
00:25:52,837 --> 00:25:54,238
[SPEAKER_22]: You have to play Be Lovin' at the commercial break.

441
00:25:54,258 --> 00:25:54,559
[SPEAKER_22]: Come on.

442
00:25:55,059 --> 00:25:57,141
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh my god, it's on Beatmania fucking 7th Mix.

443
00:25:58,382 --> 00:25:58,902
[SPEAKER_22]: OST.

444
00:25:59,923 --> 00:26:00,663
[SPEAKER_22]: Greatest song ever.

445
00:26:01,264 --> 00:26:01,884
[SPEAKER_22]: It seriously is.

446
00:26:02,085 --> 00:26:02,605
[SPEAKER_22]: You have to play it.

447
00:26:02,625 --> 00:26:03,166
[SPEAKER_22]: Like, play it now.

448
00:26:04,486 --> 00:26:06,927
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, dude, I played Little Bitch's Oni Steps today.

449
00:26:07,447 --> 00:26:08,267
[SPEAKER_22]: They're hella fun.

450
00:26:08,347 --> 00:26:10,767
[SPEAKER_22]: I was, like, surprised that they were actually really well done.

451
00:26:11,527 --> 00:26:16,108
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean, all of the Oni Steps were, like, these stupid gay songs, like... I'm sorry, not gay songs.

452
00:26:16,368 --> 00:26:22,089
[SPEAKER_22]: Rather, these old songs from DDR First Mix, and they're... The Butterfly Oni Steps are pretty cool-looking.

453
00:26:22,149 --> 00:26:24,070
[SPEAKER_22]: The Little Bitch Oni Steps are cool.

454
00:26:24,690 --> 00:26:26,370
[SPEAKER_22]: The Dom Deer Rom Oni Steps are cool.

455
00:26:26,390 --> 00:26:28,671
[SPEAKER_22]: They're not... There are no Oni Steps for Dom Deer Rom.

456
00:26:28,691 --> 00:26:30,611
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay, well, the Dom Deer Rom video is cool.

457
00:26:32,091 --> 00:26:36,434
[SPEAKER_22]: But it's amazing these old school songs that they put Onis to and shit like that.

458
00:26:36,674 --> 00:26:38,635
[SPEAKER_26]: No, it's because they fucked up the other steps the first time.

459
00:26:38,735 --> 00:26:39,355
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, no, dude.

460
00:26:39,375 --> 00:26:41,377
[SPEAKER_22]: Butterfly Basic is still one of the best ever.

461
00:26:43,298 --> 00:26:44,418
[SPEAKER_22]: Is something like Beat on Extreme?

462
00:26:45,719 --> 00:26:46,019
[SPEAKER_26]: Uh, no.

463
00:26:46,359 --> 00:26:46,640
[SPEAKER_26]: Shit.

464
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,401
[SPEAKER_22]: What about, uh... Anyways, so, um... Yeah...

465
00:26:56,702 --> 00:27:00,525
[SPEAKER_26]: Um, there's a, yeah, um, let's see here, what else?

466
00:27:00,745 --> 00:27:08,912
[SPEAKER_26]: Oh yeah, DWI Insanity, I think I mentioned this last week, um, they've got Easy to Dancer, um, sim files now, or they're DWIs for Easy to Dancer songs.

467
00:27:09,372 --> 00:27:11,093
[SPEAKER_26]: So, check those out, um.

468
00:27:12,594 --> 00:27:12,815
[SPEAKER_26]: Ternimix 3

469
00:27:42,474 --> 00:27:42,835
[SPEAKER_19]: And now?

470
00:27:43,315 --> 00:27:48,178
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah, and the really crappy DDR extreme skins for Step Mania.

471
00:27:48,659 --> 00:27:52,041
[SPEAKER_26]: I mean, it's alright, but I think the one for DWI looked much better.

472
00:27:52,421 --> 00:27:58,706
[SPEAKER_23]: One problem with Step Mania is, instead of saying Perfects and Greats, it says Hi Guys and Bye Guys, and all this crap like that.

473
00:27:59,646 --> 00:28:00,707
[SPEAKER_23]: It is so horrible.

474
00:28:00,907 --> 00:28:02,548
[SPEAKER_23]: I laughed for a month on just one.

475
00:28:02,608 --> 00:28:04,529
[SPEAKER_27]: It's the skin thing.

476
00:28:04,910 --> 00:28:09,052
[SPEAKER_27]: You're going to hear about this during the interviews because we talked to some of the folks from Killer Pals.

477
00:28:09,072 --> 00:28:11,434
[SPEAKER_27]: That's their whole little in-joke.

478
00:28:11,574 --> 00:28:13,955
[SPEAKER_26]: See, the thing is, that can be easily fixed.

479
00:28:14,476 --> 00:28:20,339
[SPEAKER_26]: Actually, I'm still playing off of the SM Max 2 skin because that's my favorite one so far.

480
00:28:22,401 --> 00:28:24,422
[SPEAKER_19]: And now this kicking of Rob was brought to you by Propel.

481
00:28:24,742 --> 00:28:25,062
[SPEAKER_27]: Hey!

482
00:28:25,583 --> 00:28:25,643
[SPEAKER_27]: Ow!

483
00:28:27,717 --> 00:28:28,077
[SPEAKER_27]: You suck.

484
00:28:28,117 --> 00:28:29,438
[SPEAKER_19]: They had ass-flavored Propel.

485
00:28:29,738 --> 00:28:30,899
[SPEAKER_19]: Damn it, we should give the fuck you some.

486
00:28:30,939 --> 00:28:32,580
[SPEAKER_27]: Why do they have ass-flavored Propel?

487
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:33,200
[SPEAKER_27]: Lemon.

488
00:28:34,301 --> 00:28:36,902
[SPEAKER_27]: That's all they had at Walgreens earlier today was lemon.

489
00:28:37,102 --> 00:28:37,403
[SPEAKER_27]: Blech.

490
00:28:38,623 --> 00:28:39,604
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, it's not that bad.

491
00:28:39,644 --> 00:28:40,685
[SPEAKER_27]: I spit on lemon.

492
00:28:40,745 --> 00:28:40,965
[SPEAKER_27]: Blech.

493
00:28:43,852 --> 00:28:45,213
[SPEAKER_27]: Okay, you want to do FUs of the week?

494
00:28:45,273 --> 00:28:45,593
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes!

495
00:28:45,694 --> 00:28:48,436
[SPEAKER_27]: Alright, we'll take a break and then do FUs.

496
00:28:48,456 --> 00:28:48,736
[SPEAKER_27]: How's that?

497
00:28:48,756 --> 00:28:49,997
[SPEAKER_27]: Alright, we're going to take a break.

498
00:28:50,017 --> 00:28:51,358
[SPEAKER_27]: We'll come back and do the FUs of the week.

499
00:28:51,398 --> 00:28:59,064
[SPEAKER_27]: So you can send those to me over private message in the chat room or to our email, orangelounge.radio.yahoo.com And if you're not in our chat room, why the hell aren't you?

500
00:28:59,124 --> 00:29:10,453
[SPEAKER_27]: Get over to our website, http://orangelounge.skie.cx And after the FUs of the week, we'll think about doing those Mopedus interviews.

501
00:29:10,513 --> 00:29:11,154
[SPEAKER_27]: How's that sound?

502
00:29:11,814 --> 00:29:12,755
[SPEAKER_27]: We will be right back.

503
00:29:14,557 --> 00:29:21,728
[SPEAKER_27]: By request from Tal, because he's such a baby, we're going to hear Be Lovin'.

504
00:29:22,129 --> 00:29:23,952
[SPEAKER_13]: Fuck, fuck, fuck.

505
00:29:24,192 --> 00:29:25,034
[SPEAKER_27]: And Daikin Kai.

506
00:29:25,374 --> 00:29:26,195
[SPEAKER_27]: All right, we'll be back.

507
00:29:26,215 --> 00:29:26,556
[SPEAKER_27]: Fuck.

508
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:52,121
DJ Ranma S

509
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:16,481
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you for watching!

510
00:31:42,637 --> 00:31:44,139
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you for watching!

511
00:32:09,202 --> 00:32:10,183
DarkSakura, DarkSakura

512
00:33:00,092 --> 00:33:00,695
Thanks for watching!

513
00:34:08,860 --> 00:34:10,461
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, this is Mel B of RTF.

514
00:34:10,821 --> 00:34:15,723
[SPEAKER_03]: And for an extra $1.99 a minute, my girlfriend Mel B can join us on all the fun together.

515
00:34:16,583 --> 00:34:22,386
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, if you're a broke ass like I am, why don't you come to the one place that costs absolutely nothing to go to and still the fun is just as great.

516
00:34:22,726 --> 00:34:24,607
[SPEAKER_03]: It's Orange Lounge Radio, Sunday nights.

517
00:34:25,187 --> 00:34:29,549
[SPEAKER_03]: Kick it with me and you just might realize the best things in life are free.

518
00:34:31,670 --> 00:34:41,756
[SPEAKER_27]: Hi, you're listening to Orange Lounge Radio, and I need some folks to fill time while I fix the chat, because we've bumped out of the chat room during that break, so hold on just one sec, I've got to get us back in.

519
00:34:42,957 --> 00:34:44,998
[SPEAKER_19]: If anyone can talk, I'd be you.

520
00:34:45,938 --> 00:34:46,539
[SPEAKER_22]: Of course I can.

521
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:53,783
[SPEAKER_22]: We were in the car today and talking about live journals, and Black Lab got me on his friend list for some reason, and I was like, how did you not get on your friend list?

522
00:34:53,843 --> 00:34:55,164
[SPEAKER_22]: And Somnia was like,

523
00:34:55,669 --> 00:34:58,391
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, Tal, it's not like you ever update your live journal anyways.

524
00:34:58,431 --> 00:35:02,754
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean, no one talks... When you update, it's like, oh my god, you updated for the first time.

525
00:35:02,814 --> 00:35:08,358
[SPEAKER_22]: Being, of course, facetious, given how much I update, especially my, what is it, verbal vomit lately.

526
00:35:09,739 --> 00:35:11,440
[SPEAKER_19]: Your post is starting to look like mine.

527
00:35:12,361 --> 00:35:14,322
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, I've had a bad week, okay?

528
00:35:14,602 --> 00:35:16,083
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm not normally angst-bubbled.

529
00:35:16,183 --> 00:35:17,344
[SPEAKER_19]: It's Triforce.

530
00:35:17,404 --> 00:35:18,685
[SPEAKER_22]: Isn't that a cool Triforce?

531
00:35:18,705 --> 00:35:19,706
[SPEAKER_22]: My uncle made it for me in India.

532
00:35:19,746 --> 00:35:20,546
[SPEAKER_22]: It's like that silver and stuff.

533
00:35:20,567 --> 00:35:20,887
[SPEAKER_22]: I'll think of it.

534
00:35:20,907 --> 00:35:21,967
[SPEAKER_22]: You can't pick them up and post it later.

535
00:35:22,308 --> 00:35:22,488
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay.

536
00:35:23,211 --> 00:35:25,514
[SPEAKER_22]: So yes, are we still filling time for you?

537
00:35:25,634 --> 00:35:40,110
[SPEAKER_27]: Oh, it like bombed out quite some time ago, but we cut out the chat room we pinged out of during the break, so we got kind of screwed up there, so we're back now though, but you can reset your FUs to us if you're in the chat room.

538
00:35:40,470 --> 00:35:40,670
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah.

539
00:35:41,190 --> 00:35:43,411
[SPEAKER_27]: So, send those FUs to me over private message.

540
00:35:43,451 --> 00:35:46,412
[SPEAKER_27]: And if you sent it while I was gone, obviously I didn't get them.

541
00:35:46,452 --> 00:35:50,933
[SPEAKER_27]: So, I only have FUs from Stress 23 Magus, Dark Tetsuya, and DCB at this point.

542
00:35:50,953 --> 00:35:55,094
[SPEAKER_27]: So, if you're not on that list, send them to me over IRC or... Email.

543
00:35:55,314 --> 00:35:56,835
[SPEAKER_27]: Email, orangeontheradio at yahoo.com.

544
00:35:57,415 --> 00:35:57,615
[SPEAKER_27]: So...

545
00:36:00,033 --> 00:36:01,133
[SPEAKER_19]: I say we go ahead and get started.

546
00:36:01,153 --> 00:36:01,333
[SPEAKER_19]: Alright.

547
00:36:01,713 --> 00:36:02,654
[SPEAKER_19]: We're going to do TerraMix.

548
00:36:03,094 --> 00:36:04,334
[SPEAKER_27]: Alright, you want TerraMix this week?

549
00:36:04,354 --> 00:36:04,414
[SPEAKER_27]: Yes.

550
00:36:04,574 --> 00:36:05,674
[SPEAKER_27]: Alright, we're going to do the FUs of the Week.

551
00:36:06,074 --> 00:36:16,136
[SPEAKER_27]: Since we have some new listeners tonight, because earlier today I spammed the DDR Live Journal community, so I know we're going to have some new listeners tonight to explain what the FUs of the Week is all about.

552
00:36:16,156 --> 00:36:19,917
[SPEAKER_19]: This is where we get angsty, bitchy, and we tell you all about it.

553
00:36:20,477 --> 00:36:23,157
[SPEAKER_19]: But you get to participate too, but you don't get to say it yourself.

554
00:36:23,177 --> 00:36:25,138
[SPEAKER_19]: We do, because we have a microphone, and therefore the power.

555
00:36:25,458 --> 00:36:25,638
[SPEAKER_27]: Yes.

556
00:36:26,038 --> 00:36:26,478
[SPEAKER_19]: Very well.

557
00:36:26,518 --> 00:36:27,038
[SPEAKER_27]: Very well put.

558
00:36:28,112 --> 00:36:30,895
[SPEAKER_19]: But this is, um, just start it.

559
00:36:30,975 --> 00:36:31,635
[SPEAKER_19]: They'll figure it out.

560
00:36:31,775 --> 00:36:32,616
[SPEAKER_19]: Alright, here we go.

561
00:36:32,736 --> 00:36:34,037
[SPEAKER_19]: Because they're a complete moron.

562
00:36:34,618 --> 00:36:36,219
[SPEAKER_19]: Starting with the one and only.

563
00:36:36,299 --> 00:36:37,160
[SPEAKER_19]: We're not morons.

564
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:38,522
[SPEAKER_19]: If you're listening to us, you're not a moron.

565
00:36:46,489 --> 00:36:47,670
[SPEAKER_09]: This is fucked up.

566
00:36:48,457 --> 00:36:51,339
[SPEAKER_19]: I always have to wait for that, that's crazy.

567
00:36:51,359 --> 00:37:11,470
[SPEAKER_19]: Um, anyway, my first fuck you of the week goes toward Walgreens, so not having berries, or peach-flavored Propel, and having only lemon, which is the ass of all flavors of Propel, although not that bad, because it's still propel, and everyone can see, it's not the best, so, ass is ass, and that certainly is the butt track.

568
00:37:12,071 --> 00:37:12,131
[SPEAKER_19]: Um,

569
00:37:13,997 --> 00:37:21,319
[SPEAKER_19]: My other Fuck Me of the Week goes to this ugly bitch that was driving behind me yesterday when I was following Jabberwocky running errands.

570
00:37:21,619 --> 00:37:25,860
[SPEAKER_22]: Dude, DarkSakura goes psychotic in the car.

571
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:26,561
[SPEAKER_22]: It is awesome.

572
00:37:26,901 --> 00:37:36,143
[SPEAKER_22]: In the two minutes I was in there, I was just like, wow, waiting for the, you know, big, hella hard level 3 super to come out and turn us all into ash.

573
00:37:36,163 --> 00:37:38,124
[SPEAKER_22]: But the light went forward, something, something, something.

574
00:37:38,704 --> 00:37:42,047
[SPEAKER_22]: You know her... The Dark Sakura Super!

575
00:37:43,388 --> 00:37:44,449
[SPEAKER_19]: The Haruka Super.

576
00:37:44,489 --> 00:37:44,809
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

577
00:37:46,270 --> 00:37:48,592
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, and it just kicks your ass seven ways from Sunday.

578
00:37:48,632 --> 00:37:50,093
[SPEAKER_19]: Hey, I'm trying to be angsty here!

579
00:37:50,113 --> 00:37:50,674
[SPEAKER_19]: Gimme that!

580
00:37:51,254 --> 00:37:52,636
[SPEAKER_19]: Ooh, two microphones!

581
00:37:53,256 --> 00:37:53,536
[SPEAKER_19]: Ah!

582
00:37:53,616 --> 00:37:59,841
[SPEAKER_19]: Um, a fuck you goes toward, um... Bullshit.

583
00:38:00,062 --> 00:38:03,364
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't know what else to... Oh yeah, I was talking about the ugly bitch behind me.

584
00:38:03,384 --> 00:38:03,584
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay.

585
00:38:05,979 --> 00:38:06,600
[SPEAKER_19]: No, not you.

586
00:38:06,620 --> 00:38:07,960
[SPEAKER_19]: You were here.

587
00:38:08,041 --> 00:38:13,624
[SPEAKER_19]: Anyway, I'm trying to keep following distance, you know, which is how you are supposed to drive.

588
00:38:14,345 --> 00:38:18,467
[SPEAKER_19]: By law, you have to keep a three-second following distance line.

589
00:38:18,808 --> 00:38:21,369
[SPEAKER_19]: This woman, every time I stop, she's right up on my bumper.

590
00:38:21,409 --> 00:38:23,531
[SPEAKER_19]: And I always leave, you know, about a foot...

591
00:38:24,111 --> 00:38:26,012
[SPEAKER_19]: Welcome to California.

592
00:38:26,032 --> 00:38:26,813
[SPEAKER_22]: Here's your license.

593
00:38:27,273 --> 00:38:28,954
[SPEAKER_22]: She was fucking ugly, though.

594
00:38:29,254 --> 00:38:31,355
[SPEAKER_19]: And I would look in my rearview mirror and there'd be this face.

595
00:38:32,276 --> 00:38:35,718
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay, and me, normally, I'm not one to say about how people look.

596
00:38:35,778 --> 00:38:37,059
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm normally not that superficial.

597
00:38:37,599 --> 00:38:38,820
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't care how big somebody is.

598
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:40,661
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't care what they look like.

599
00:38:40,721 --> 00:38:43,643
[SPEAKER_19]: The chicken last message looked like a horse.

600
00:38:44,163 --> 00:38:46,124
[SPEAKER_19]: But I am not superficial like that.

601
00:38:46,604 --> 00:38:48,305
[SPEAKER_19]: But I'm sorry, this woman scared me.

602
00:38:48,325 --> 00:38:49,346
[SPEAKER_19]: She had this epic condition.

603
00:38:53,269 --> 00:38:59,476
[SPEAKER_19]: She looked like a... A skin condition or like missing a nose condition or what?

604
00:38:59,496 --> 00:39:00,698
[SPEAKER_19]: She looked like a rhinoceros.

605
00:39:01,078 --> 00:39:06,584
[SPEAKER_19]: She had these folds of skin where skin should not have folds.

606
00:39:06,945 --> 00:39:09,288
[SPEAKER_19]: And then her eyes were shrunken deep into her head.

607
00:39:11,245 --> 00:39:22,295
[SPEAKER_19]: and like her eyes looked swollen and then she had like really ugly hair that was like really curly and she would bump my car so finally I hit a stop sign and I just stayed there I stayed there for three minutes

608
00:39:31,445 --> 00:39:32,386
[SPEAKER_19]: and I didn't let her go.

609
00:39:33,066 --> 00:39:36,890
[SPEAKER_19]: She was starting to turn, I would just ignore it and then she turned.

610
00:39:36,950 --> 00:39:46,377
[SPEAKER_19]: So then I went on my way and eventually the bitch turned and someone got in the way and I was like, and then this other ugly person got behind me.

611
00:39:46,397 --> 00:39:49,860
[SPEAKER_19]: She was almost as scary, but not quite as bad, but she was just the baddest driver.

612
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:51,161
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh my god, I hate people here.

613
00:39:51,181 --> 00:39:52,002
[SPEAKER_19]: Not really hate everybody.

614
00:39:52,062 --> 00:39:53,943
[SPEAKER_09]: And then... You're not supposed to, it's my fucking use.

615
00:40:02,679 --> 00:40:03,059
[SPEAKER_27]: Is that it?

616
00:40:03,079 --> 00:40:03,700
[SPEAKER_27]: Or do you have more?

617
00:40:04,740 --> 00:40:14,527
[SPEAKER_19]: I had another one, but just remembering that woman's face sort of gave me an involuntary lobotomy.

618
00:40:14,587 --> 00:40:20,811
[SPEAKER_19]: Not actually having the front lip of my brain broken, but just having it written in art.

619
00:40:21,972 --> 00:40:22,653
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, moving on.

620
00:40:22,673 --> 00:40:25,595
[SPEAKER_19]: And by the way, you can look up inert at www.gardenationary.com.

621
00:40:25,635 --> 00:40:26,535
[SPEAKER_19]: It's spelled I-N-E-R-T-I-N-T.

622
00:40:30,314 --> 00:40:31,295
[SPEAKER_10]: I, N, E, what?

623
00:40:31,495 --> 00:40:35,037
[SPEAKER_10]: Moving on, next FB of the week.

624
00:40:35,097 --> 00:40:35,958
[SPEAKER_27]: Loki, let's hear it.

625
00:40:45,911 --> 00:40:47,332
[SPEAKER_26]: Okay, first F.E.

626
00:40:47,412 --> 00:40:50,495
[SPEAKER_26]: of the week goes to the stupid news coverage of the space shuttle.

627
00:40:50,575 --> 00:40:53,057
[SPEAKER_26]: Listen, to be honest, you're dumbass.

628
00:40:53,337 --> 00:41:00,083
[SPEAKER_26]: So, some retard that was building the space shuttle forgot to put a freaking heat-sensitive tile on the wing.

629
00:41:00,523 --> 00:41:03,426
[SPEAKER_26]: And that, oh, I guess caused the shuttle to burn up at Mach 18.

630
00:41:03,726 --> 00:41:06,829
[SPEAKER_19]: Not to mention that the Columbia is the oldest space shuttle.

631
00:41:06,909 --> 00:41:07,829
[SPEAKER_19]: It was in operation...

632
00:41:08,910 --> 00:41:09,530
[SPEAKER_22]: It doesn't matter.

633
00:41:09,811 --> 00:41:11,611
[SPEAKER_22]: They're going- 20 fucking years old.

634
00:41:11,631 --> 00:41:13,292
[SPEAKER_22]: That thing should not be retrofitted.

635
00:41:13,752 --> 00:41:14,993
[SPEAKER_22]: It shouldn't be ins- SHUT UP!

636
00:41:15,233 --> 00:41:15,913
[SPEAKER_22]: I'M TALKING!

637
00:41:16,313 --> 00:41:16,853
[SPEAKER_22]: Not you!

638
00:41:17,253 --> 00:41:17,814
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm talking.

639
00:41:18,674 --> 00:41:20,095
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm more important than you are.

640
00:41:20,335 --> 00:41:21,695
[SPEAKER_26]: Stop talking.

641
00:41:22,155 --> 00:41:22,476
[SPEAKER_26]: Anyway.

642
00:41:23,496 --> 00:41:26,157
[SPEAKER_26]: Anyway, so, um, yeah, what do they not know?

643
00:41:26,357 --> 00:41:27,578
[SPEAKER_26]: It was actually Al-Qaeda.

644
00:41:27,598 --> 00:41:28,298
[SPEAKER_26]: They sent a CAC.

645
00:41:28,578 --> 00:41:34,139
[SPEAKER_27]: The people that I felt bad for were the people who were actually involved with it, like NASA, the government, the families.

646
00:41:56,025 --> 00:41:58,826
[SPEAKER_19]: and the friends that I had, the friend I had who saw it happen.

647
00:41:59,906 --> 00:42:01,707
[SPEAKER_22]: Anyway... And my cousin who knew them all.

648
00:42:02,347 --> 00:42:06,328
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, don't care, okay, anyways... Hold on, so, uh... I feel bad for the government.

649
00:42:08,008 --> 00:42:10,409
[SPEAKER_26]: LET ME FINISH, GODDAMNIT, OR YOU'RE GONNA BE ADDED TO THE LIST!

650
00:42:10,429 --> 00:42:13,590
[SPEAKER_19]: You're gonna have to pay for this, and it's gonna come out of our pocket.

651
00:42:14,230 --> 00:42:19,771
[SPEAKER_26]: Okay, anyways, so the shuttle sucked, people burned up and are dead, and they're looking for the remains over three states.

652
00:42:20,111 --> 00:42:20,671
[SPEAKER_26]: So you know what?

653
00:42:21,012 --> 00:42:22,552
[SPEAKER_26]: I say hooray for human failure.

654
00:42:24,622 --> 00:42:28,123
[SPEAKER_26]: Now, second one on the list is... Can you address those cards and letters to Loki?

655
00:42:28,143 --> 00:42:31,724
[SPEAKER_26]: The second one on the list is kind of related, is Yahoo News.

656
00:42:32,484 --> 00:42:34,184
[SPEAKER_26]: I like to call them Captain Obvious.

657
00:42:35,184 --> 00:42:39,365
[SPEAKER_26]: Okay, they're like, the headline's all, The trouble started on the left wing.

658
00:42:39,425 --> 00:42:44,486
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah, they've been saying that ever since the stupid thing blew up, we had censor failure in the left wing.

659
00:42:44,766 --> 00:42:46,687
[SPEAKER_26]: Maybe the trouble started on the left wing?

660
00:42:47,807 --> 00:42:48,867
[SPEAKER_19]: Yahoo is ruder.

661
00:42:49,727 --> 00:42:52,708
[SPEAKER_19]: It's a British news reporter.

662
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:55,260
[SPEAKER_26]: It doesn't matter, they still suck.

663
00:42:55,340 --> 00:43:00,062
[SPEAKER_26]: It doesn't matter, they still suck.

664
00:43:00,082 --> 00:43:04,403
[SPEAKER_26]: They're still covering people that are getting hurt imitating jackass stuff.

665
00:43:04,563 --> 00:43:07,624
[SPEAKER_26]: Even though the show's been off the TV for like, you know, over a year now.

666
00:43:08,004 --> 00:43:13,986
[SPEAKER_26]: So... Yeah, and the commercials where they have just the freaks down there.

667
00:43:14,006 --> 00:43:15,206
[SPEAKER_26]: So, screw Yahoo.

668
00:43:16,062 --> 00:43:17,943
[SPEAKER_26]: Um, let's see, what else here?

669
00:43:18,003 --> 00:43:19,423
[SPEAKER_26]: I know there was something else.

670
00:43:20,004 --> 00:43:20,804
[SPEAKER_26]: Um, oh yeah!

671
00:43:21,424 --> 00:43:23,265
[SPEAKER_26]: Um, American Idol Rejects.

672
00:43:24,365 --> 00:43:38,250
[SPEAKER_26]: Okay, listen you people, I don't know why hundreds and thousands of you, you know, thought you could sing, or, I don't even know why you, I don't know, your parents decided to breed, because you're like some of the weirdest inbred freaks I've ever seen.

673
00:43:38,570 --> 00:43:42,572
[SPEAKER_26]: And like the guy that was quote-unquote the worst- Like a bad guy.

674
00:43:42,612 --> 00:43:42,732
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

675
00:43:43,152 --> 00:43:50,048
[SPEAKER_26]: Cut for the very first time Okay, now I'm sure you're more on key than you were probably

676
00:43:53,436 --> 00:44:00,101
[SPEAKER_26]: Anyway, I'm sure that, you know, at the time, the freak experiment with the cow and pig genes brought together to make some weird human.

677
00:44:00,641 --> 00:44:14,472
[SPEAKER_26]: Thought it might have been a good idea at the time, but no it wasn't, and you really suck, and I'm also sick and tired of the secret people that are whining because they're like, I partied and I can't sing now, I'm famous already!

678
00:44:15,422 --> 00:44:16,863
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm gonna be famous no matter what!

679
00:44:17,123 --> 00:44:18,283
[SPEAKER_19]: Alright, enough of that.

680
00:44:18,303 --> 00:44:22,245
[SPEAKER_19]: Now we're gonna go back to the reoccurring FDU of stupid drivers.

681
00:44:52,342 --> 00:44:59,554
[SPEAKER_26]: Listen, old people should not drive cars, let alone large vans coming towards me.

682
00:45:00,461 --> 00:45:03,484
[SPEAKER_26]: Listen, when you're turning, you're not supposed to turn into the oncoming traffic.

683
00:45:03,604 --> 00:45:06,606
[SPEAKER_26]: You're supposed to turn into, you know, traffic going the same way.

684
00:45:07,227 --> 00:45:09,629
[SPEAKER_26]: So, I don't like you looking at me and all of a sudden, Oh!

685
00:45:09,729 --> 00:45:11,570
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm not supposed to turn in that lane where there's a car!

686
00:45:12,611 --> 00:45:13,072
[SPEAKER_26]: But yeah.

687
00:45:13,912 --> 00:45:19,857
[SPEAKER_26]: So, yeah, and F you for me missing, uh, stupid, uh, raffle in Animal Crossing.

688
00:45:19,877 --> 00:45:22,259
[SPEAKER_13]: My girlfriend, she was part of my game.

689
00:45:27,085 --> 00:45:27,486
[SPEAKER_27]: My turn?

690
00:45:27,546 --> 00:45:27,927
[SPEAKER_27]: My turn?

691
00:45:28,288 --> 00:45:28,529
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah.

692
00:45:28,689 --> 00:45:29,231
[SPEAKER_27]: Alright, yay.

693
00:45:29,872 --> 00:45:32,680
[SPEAKER_27]: As of this week, I have a new FU theme.

694
00:45:33,342 --> 00:45:35,267
[SPEAKER_27]: I've ditched Bakwa for something much better.

695
00:45:37,142 --> 00:45:40,004
[SPEAKER_27]: Dancer, ladies and gentlemen, is my new FU, because I love this song.

696
00:45:40,225 --> 00:45:41,385
[SPEAKER_27]: And actually, Tal suggested it.

697
00:45:41,646 --> 00:45:43,367
[SPEAKER_22]: Dude, this song is like the fucking shit.

698
00:45:43,887 --> 00:45:52,234
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean, my uber-goth industrial head roommate sits there and like, oh my god, if DDR had more songs like this instead of that fucking poppy shit, I'd play it all day and night.

699
00:45:52,394 --> 00:45:53,535
[SPEAKER_27]: Anyway, can I get my FUs?

700
00:45:53,555 --> 00:45:54,176
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you.

701
00:45:54,216 --> 00:45:55,777
[SPEAKER_27]: My FUs are actually Bomani-related.

702
00:45:55,857 --> 00:46:00,521
[SPEAKER_27]: Well, I have one Bomani-related FU, because coming back from the Milpitas tournament, which we'll get to the coverage of in a little bit...

703
00:46:02,799 --> 00:46:06,308
[SPEAKER_27]: whoever built that merge where 680 and 80 meet

704
00:46:08,523 --> 00:46:09,604
[SPEAKER_27]: Fuck you!

705
00:46:10,284 --> 00:46:21,388
[SPEAKER_27]: Whoever designed that a two-lane freeway should have to merge three times to get back on the 80, causing traffic to back up for like five miles, you're a cunt, and I don't like you.

706
00:46:21,608 --> 00:46:29,251
[SPEAKER_22]: Dude, you take the fucking exit that takes you by South Scandia to the A if you want, you can stop there, but B, you can get back off the highway and skip that whole thing.

707
00:46:29,271 --> 00:46:30,192
[SPEAKER_22]: This is the problem, Tal.

708
00:46:30,632 --> 00:46:33,233
[SPEAKER_22]: Everybody knows about that, so it's not much better.

709
00:46:34,293 --> 00:46:35,454
[SPEAKER_27]: That is true.

710
00:46:36,335 --> 00:46:39,417
[SPEAKER_27]: Anyway, so F whoever built that.

711
00:46:39,797 --> 00:46:40,317
[SPEAKER_27]: Puppies!

712
00:46:40,337 --> 00:46:43,019
[SPEAKER_12]: Why aren't you playing Animal Crossing?

713
00:46:43,860 --> 00:46:46,141
[SPEAKER_27]: Oh, because you're coming to do the FUs?

714
00:46:46,262 --> 00:46:47,022
[SPEAKER_27]: Oh, you okay, Ryan?

[SPEAKER_27]: I'm putting you back in the closet where you belong, Ryan.

717
00:46:58,492 --> 00:47:02,013
[SPEAKER_27]: I have more FUs, I'm trying to think of them.

[SPEAKER_19]: Say it with me.

723
00:47:22,438 --> 00:47:22,718
[SPEAKER_22]: Fuck you!

724
00:47:22,738 --> 00:47:25,963
[SPEAKER_22]: That's the fact that I still can't get a date.

725
00:47:25,983 --> 00:47:26,383
[SPEAKER_22]: That sucks.

726
00:47:26,444 --> 00:47:26,664
[SPEAKER_22]: Fuck that!

[SPEAKER_27]: All right, Tal, you have so much to say.

732
00:47:45,394 --> 00:47:45,774
[SPEAKER_27]: Let's hear it.

733
00:47:45,814 --> 00:47:46,474
[SPEAKER_22]: Actually, you know what?

734
00:47:46,534 --> 00:47:52,177
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't really need to give an F you because I can just sit and rant on my live journal and people can not read it because I post so much.

735
00:47:52,657 --> 00:47:55,759
[SPEAKER_22]: You know, F my fucking nature to talk so goddamn much.

736
00:47:55,799 --> 00:47:57,320
[SPEAKER_22]: It gets so annoying to other people, doesn't it?

737
00:47:57,660 --> 00:47:57,860
[SPEAKER_22]: Fuck.

738
00:47:58,580 --> 00:47:59,621

741
00:48:07,408 --> 00:48:09,470
[SPEAKER_22]: Where the dude is like, being blacked by his buddy.

742
00:48:09,770 --> 00:48:10,931
[SPEAKER_22]: Uh, we're gonna hear it later.

743
00:48:11,191 --> 00:48:12,112
[SPEAKER_22]: Greatest song ever.

744
00:48:13,193 --> 00:48:14,815
[SPEAKER_22]: It's my cage match pick for tonight.

745
00:48:17,777 --> 00:48:18,578
[SPEAKER_13]: Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.

746
00:48:18,598 --> 00:48:20,379
[SPEAKER_13]: I just made up music.

747
00:48:20,399 --> 00:48:20,459
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

748
00:48:46,095 --> 00:48:47,696
[SPEAKER_22]: Fuck the F letter in the opposite.

749
00:48:48,797 --> 00:48:53,541
[SPEAKER_22]: Fuck the Daredevil movie for being gay.

750
00:48:53,581 --> 00:48:59,585
[SPEAKER_19]: Fuck them for having a cracker-ass Elektra.

751
00:48:59,905 --> 00:49:08,412
[SPEAKER_19]: You know the only thing that would make that movie cool is if they had chemistry fighting.

752
00:49:09,577 --> 00:49:13,739
[SPEAKER_19]: Because Kevin Smith can take any piece of crap and make it cool.

753
00:49:13,759 --> 00:49:16,040
[SPEAKER_27]: Like Scary Movie 3, which is happening, by the way.

754
00:49:16,060 --> 00:49:19,302
[SPEAKER_19]: I thought they already did that.

755
00:49:19,462 --> 00:49:22,203
[SPEAKER_22]: Didn't they do, like... Oh!

756
00:49:23,063 --> 00:49:27,245
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, no, it was Scream 3 that had Jay and Tyler Bob in it.

757
00:49:27,345 --> 00:49:29,106
[SPEAKER_22]: Oops.

758
00:49:30,307 --> 00:49:32,368
[SPEAKER_19]: As I said, Scream 3 had Jay and Tyler Bob.

759
00:49:32,468 --> 00:49:34,729
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes, they were in the background.

760
00:49:34,749 --> 00:49:35,549
[SPEAKER_19]: I hate Jay and Tyler Bob.

761
00:49:38,646 --> 00:49:40,787
[SPEAKER_22]: Great, who's gonna talk now?

762
00:50:01,832 --> 00:50:04,374
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, I'm sure you'll figure out some way to fill three hours.

763
00:50:04,794 --> 00:50:05,494
[SPEAKER_27]: Bye, Tal.

764
00:50:05,714 --> 00:50:06,495
[SPEAKER_27]: Thanks for coming.

765
00:50:06,635 --> 00:50:07,195
[SPEAKER_27]: Happy birthday.

766
00:50:07,395 --> 00:50:08,676
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody sing to Tal.

767
00:50:09,237 --> 00:50:12,299
[SPEAKER_02]: Happy birthday, fuck you.

768
00:50:12,859 --> 00:50:15,781
[SPEAKER_02]: Happy birthday, fuck you.

769
00:50:16,301 --> 00:50:19,843
[SPEAKER_02]: Happy birthday, fuck you, Tal.

770
00:50:20,624 --> 00:50:21,164
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck you, too.

771
00:50:21,204 --> 00:50:24,106
[SPEAKER_02]: Happy birthday, fuck you.

772
00:50:24,126 --> 00:50:24,926
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, get out.

773
00:50:26,067 --> 00:50:28,649
[SPEAKER_26]: Oh, yes, and I do expect presents on my birthday, just so you know.

774
00:50:29,932 --> 00:50:31,433
[SPEAKER_22]: Bitch, you're getting all this shit for free.

775
00:50:31,493 --> 00:50:31,833
[SPEAKER_22]: All right.

776
00:50:31,853 --> 00:50:33,094
[SPEAKER_26]: Here we go.

777
00:50:33,114 --> 00:50:35,134
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah, it's the thought that counts.

778
00:50:35,975 --> 00:50:36,755
[SPEAKER_27]: Moving along.

779
00:50:37,376 --> 00:50:39,717
[SPEAKER_27]: Let's get to Black Lab because I have this song queued up already.

780
00:50:39,797 --> 00:50:43,158
[SPEAKER_27]: So you have any, I'm sure, need I ask if Puppy has any FUs of the week?

781
00:50:43,899 --> 00:50:45,299
[SPEAKER_24]: Oh, yes, you don't need to ask me.

782
00:50:45,399 --> 00:50:45,799
[SPEAKER_24]: Let's see.

783
00:50:45,900 --> 00:50:46,580
[SPEAKER_24]: First of all...

784
00:50:47,759 --> 00:51:04,771
[SPEAKER_24]: A big, large FUCK YOU to that damn ECS project that I had to do this week because I was working on that shit probably a good 36 to 40 hours straight and I still did not get it done before the deadline.

785
00:51:05,071 --> 00:51:08,454
[SPEAKER_24]: I got help from a bunch of people and I still could not get it done.

786
00:51:08,794 --> 00:51:14,358
[SPEAKER_24]: And it just would not fucking work and I was ready to freaking put a knife to my throat because it was that fucking bad.

787
00:51:15,450 --> 00:51:18,011
[SPEAKER_24]: And then, yeah, then I slept in that.

788
00:51:18,051 --> 00:51:20,332
[SPEAKER_27]: Just make sure if you're going to slit your wrist, go with the vein.

789
00:51:20,352 --> 00:51:23,594
[SPEAKER_27]: So many people do it against it, and that's not the way you do it.

790
00:51:23,614 --> 00:51:26,575
[SPEAKER_27]: When you cut more... Anyway, yeah, anyway, sorry.

791
00:51:27,596 --> 00:51:30,517
[SPEAKER_27]: We don't want Puppy to kill himself.

792
00:51:30,537 --> 00:51:31,898
[SPEAKER_24]: Well, let's see.

793
00:51:31,918 --> 00:51:40,002
[SPEAKER_24]: Actually, it was from the craft, so... Fuck sudden hailstorms, because I was... Yesterday...

794
00:51:41,454 --> 00:51:45,715
[SPEAKER_24]: Loki, shut up, I'm trying to talk.

795
00:51:46,035 --> 00:51:49,636
[SPEAKER_24]: You're distracting me.

796
00:51:49,756 --> 00:51:51,337
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm still trying to continue.

797
00:51:51,377 --> 00:51:52,917
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to talk about suicide.

798
00:51:55,117 --> 00:51:56,798
[SPEAKER_02]: Go kill yourself and I'll take over the show.

799
00:51:57,398 --> 00:51:58,738
Happy?

800
00:51:59,639 --> 00:52:03,320
[SPEAKER_24]: Come here.

801
00:52:03,340 --> 00:52:03,840
[SPEAKER_24]: No, thank you.

802
00:52:08,133 --> 00:52:08,913
[SPEAKER_24]: I can run.

803
00:52:08,993 --> 00:52:10,494
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm creeping closer.

804
00:52:10,534 --> 00:52:12,574
[SPEAKER_19]: He's just gonna kick me, I know that.

805
00:52:12,614 --> 00:52:13,735
[SPEAKER_24]: No, I'm not gonna kick you.

806
00:52:13,815 --> 00:52:14,175
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay.

807
00:52:14,235 --> 00:52:15,055
[SPEAKER_24]: Down, boy.

808
00:52:15,135 --> 00:52:16,735
[SPEAKER_24]: Look at my hat!

809
00:52:16,795 --> 00:52:16,835
[SPEAKER_24]: No!

810
00:52:16,856 --> 00:52:16,936
[SPEAKER_24]: No!

811
00:52:16,956 --> 00:52:17,416
[SPEAKER_24]: Not my hat!

812
00:52:17,436 --> 00:52:18,936
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay, I have... No, don't get it!

813
00:52:37,245 --> 00:52:41,687
[SPEAKER_24]: Kid Puppyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy

814
00:52:59,281 --> 00:53:00,562
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah, it fucking hurt!

815
00:53:01,142 --> 00:53:03,603
[SPEAKER_24]: I had to bail underneath a gas station.

816
00:53:03,623 --> 00:53:05,524
[SPEAKER_19]: That looks like why you call Mike Tyson's a sissy.

817
00:53:05,544 --> 00:53:05,684
[SPEAKER_19]: What?

818
00:53:05,884 --> 00:53:07,304
[SPEAKER_19]: Is that why you look like a sissy?

819
00:53:07,344 --> 00:53:08,465
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, that's why you call him a sissy.

820
00:53:08,485 --> 00:53:08,625
[SPEAKER_19]: What?

821
00:53:08,725 --> 00:53:10,846
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't have... What was I just talking about?

822
00:53:10,866 --> 00:53:12,847
[SPEAKER_24]: I have absolutely no clue what she was talking about.

823
00:53:12,927 --> 00:53:14,207
[SPEAKER_19]: Is there a door?

824
00:53:14,807 --> 00:53:15,167
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm a nerd.

825
00:53:25,659 --> 00:53:40,191
[SPEAKER_24]: Alright, I just got a couple quick ones.

826
00:53:40,431 --> 00:53:43,994
[SPEAKER_23]: Number one, fuck you to my DVD player for not letting me play Vulgar.

827
00:53:44,014 --> 00:53:48,657
[SPEAKER_23]: I have been waiting forever to get a hold of that DVD and my DVD player has died.

828
00:53:49,298 --> 00:53:52,661
[SPEAKER_23]: Another one, fuck you to Evil once again who can't drive.

829
00:53:53,673 --> 00:54:01,820
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm on my way walking here, and a guy can't wait long enough for me to cross the road, so he comes in like inches for trying to kill me, because, you know, he's brilliant at everything.

830
00:54:01,900 --> 00:54:03,501
[SPEAKER_23]: He's some little ghetto boy or whatever.

831
00:54:04,362 --> 00:54:09,306
[SPEAKER_23]: And another one, fuck you to all the jocks who have to make fun of everybody who plays DDR.

832
00:54:09,326 --> 00:54:10,607
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm really getting sick and tired of it.

833
00:54:11,207 --> 00:54:12,468
[SPEAKER_23]: That's when you kicked him in the balls.

834
00:54:12,488 --> 00:54:13,189
[SPEAKER_23]: You brought me balls!

835
00:54:35,663 --> 00:54:36,283
[SPEAKER_23]: That's all I got.

836
00:54:36,343 --> 00:54:37,504
[SPEAKER_19]: No, that's what you do.

837
00:54:38,264 --> 00:54:41,926
[SPEAKER_19]: It's handy that you freaking tell them what happened and they will throw their ass out.

838
00:54:42,006 --> 00:54:43,267
[SPEAKER_19]: It's handy that they will.

839
00:54:43,627 --> 00:54:47,649
[SPEAKER_27]: Jonas just got here, so we're going to go ahead and let him do FUs because he brought balls.

840
00:54:48,289 --> 00:54:50,130
[SPEAKER_27]: Jonas, you've got to keep it quick this week.

841
00:54:50,590 --> 00:54:51,750
[SPEAKER_19]: I've never had balls.

842
00:54:51,770 --> 00:54:54,412
[SPEAKER_19]: I have to say, sorry for anybody who wants to hear any more FUs.

843
00:54:54,452 --> 00:54:55,692
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't have any today.

844
00:54:56,453 --> 00:54:56,733
[SPEAKER_27]: What?

845
00:54:57,453 --> 00:54:58,474
[SPEAKER_27]: You mean you're in a good mood?

846
00:54:58,514 --> 00:54:59,174
[SPEAKER_27]: What's this about?

847
00:55:04,023 --> 00:55:05,124
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you for the balls, we appreciate it.

848
00:55:05,144 --> 00:55:05,604
[SPEAKER_26]: Oh shit, here we go.

849
00:55:05,624 --> 00:55:11,449
[SPEAKER_26]: Well, since I missed the deadline, fuck's cool for costing me to get the whole bunch of delays.

850
00:55:12,190 --> 00:55:15,632
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll put them in the header for my content of the contest.

851
00:55:22,268 --> 00:55:22,829
[SPEAKER_26]: And it doesn't.

852
00:55:23,249 --> 00:55:24,030
[SPEAKER_07]: But I missed it.

853
00:55:24,050 --> 00:55:24,630
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah.

854
00:55:25,091 --> 00:55:27,273
[SPEAKER_26]: But I missed the deadline.

855
00:55:27,553 --> 00:55:27,753
[SPEAKER_27]: Nope.

856
00:55:28,254 --> 00:55:28,514
[SPEAKER_27]: Alright.

857
00:55:28,914 --> 00:55:29,935
[SPEAKER_27]: Chatroom FUs time.

858
00:55:29,975 --> 00:55:30,356
[SPEAKER_27]: Here we go.

859
00:55:30,476 --> 00:55:36,341
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm going to run through these really fast because I've seen... There's more chatroom FUs tonight than I've ever seen before.

860
00:55:36,422 --> 00:55:37,463
[SPEAKER_27]: So we've got to run through these.

861
00:55:37,523 --> 00:55:38,083
[SPEAKER_27]: Alright, kids.

862
00:55:38,123 --> 00:55:38,584
[SPEAKER_27]: Here we go.

863
00:55:39,384 --> 00:55:39,885
[SPEAKER_27]: Starting off.

864
00:55:41,286 --> 00:55:41,927
[SPEAKER_27]: Oh my god.

865
00:55:42,087 --> 00:55:43,308
[SPEAKER_27]: A continued FU to his ex.

866
00:55:44,629 --> 00:55:46,991
[SPEAKER_27]: Maybe she'd find nothing but sorrow and pain in the arms of others.

867
00:55:47,051 --> 00:55:48,292
[SPEAKER_27]: Yes, my own personal curse there.

868
00:55:48,673 --> 00:55:50,975
[SPEAKER_27]: Next, I want to send an FU to Megan, you little fucking bitch.

869
00:55:51,035 --> 00:55:51,515
[SPEAKER_27]: Die already.

870
00:55:51,635 --> 00:55:53,777
[SPEAKER_27]: Also, I'd like to further the FU with an FU to myself.

871
00:55:53,817 --> 00:55:55,158
[SPEAKER_27]: Fuck me for being so hung up on my ex.

872
00:55:55,198 --> 00:55:55,939
[SPEAKER_27]: Save me, somebody.

873
00:55:56,499 --> 00:55:59,202
[SPEAKER_19]: Fuck balls, because I think it might have been going to hell.

874
00:55:59,662 --> 00:55:59,882
[SPEAKER_27]: Alright.

875
00:56:01,523 --> 00:56:03,784
[SPEAKER_27]: Uh... F you to politicians as a whole.

876
00:56:03,844 --> 00:56:05,425
[SPEAKER_27]: Gray Davis especially deserves to die.

877
00:56:05,485 --> 00:56:11,467
[SPEAKER_27]: Secondly, government headquarters and Saksucks ass, they make things so hard for me to get my job with sudden rule fucking changes.

878
00:56:11,527 --> 00:56:15,189
[SPEAKER_27]: I also wanted to send F you to everyone that thinks what happened yesterday was terrorism.

879
00:56:15,209 --> 00:56:17,349
[SPEAKER_27]: The shuttle was under huge security before and during launch.

880
00:56:18,690 --> 00:56:19,890
[SPEAKER_27]: So, F that.

881
00:56:23,572 --> 00:56:23,892
[SPEAKER_27]: Okay.

882
00:56:26,922 --> 00:56:30,343
[SPEAKER_27]: 23rd Magus says, F you to gangster rap fans with no taste in music.

883
00:56:30,403 --> 00:56:32,984
[SPEAKER_27]: I played maybe two tack songs the whole time.

884
00:56:33,324 --> 00:56:34,805
[SPEAKER_27]: Let's review the rules the crowd used.

885
00:56:35,345 --> 00:56:34,805
1.

886
00:56:35,385 --> 00:56:39,366
[SPEAKER_27]: If you play anything with a guitar in it, anywhere in the song you get mobbed by gangster rap fans.

887
00:56:40,346 --> 00:56:39,366
2.

888
00:56:40,406 --> 00:56:44,407
[SPEAKER_27]: If you play anything with a synthesizer in it, anywhere in the song you get mobbed by gangster rap fans.

889
00:56:44,648 --> 00:56:44,407
3.

890
00:56:44,668 --> 00:56:48,669
[SPEAKER_27]: If you play anything without lyrics, you get mobbed by gangster rap fans.

891
00:56:49,469 --> 00:56:50,350
[SPEAKER_27]: Oh, but it gets a lot better.

892
00:56:50,430 --> 00:56:54,552
[SPEAKER_27]: Four, if you play anything done by a white guy, you get mobbed by gangsta rap fans.

893
00:56:55,212 --> 00:57:01,496
[SPEAKER_27]: If you play old school rap, MC Hammer, Sir Mix-a-Lot, you know when rap was good, you get mobbed by gangsta rap fans.

894
00:57:01,796 --> 00:57:05,138

[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry?

903
00:57:36,580 --> 00:57:43,249
[SPEAKER_27]: I heard, you're going to hear this during the Milpitas Golf Land interviews that we have that we're getting to later, but they all got behind the machine and did a big, like, Shiva Buddha thing.

904
00:57:44,591 --> 00:57:45,272
[SPEAKER_27]: You'll see, you'll see.

[SPEAKER_27]: Alright.

906
00:57:47,775 --> 00:57:50,379

[SPEAKER_19]: That owned.

908
00:57:54,141 --> 00:57:55,582

01:10:45,800 --> 01:10:47,441
[SPEAKER_27]: We're going to start those interviews right now.

1043
01:10:47,481 --> 01:10:48,943
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm so glad you asked, Brad.

1044
01:10:49,623 --> 01:10:54,027
[SPEAKER_27]: As you may or may not know, on Friday I took an adventure over to... Would you like to feel my balls?

1045
01:10:56,089 --> 01:10:57,871
[SPEAKER_27]: Oh, you're stroking Jamie's balls live on air?

1046
01:11:00,112 --> 01:11:02,534
[SPEAKER_27]: Can you explain the G-rated version of what balls really are?

1047
01:11:03,314 --> 01:11:06,997
[SPEAKER_27]: Because they may not sell balls everywhere, so I need you to explain what balls is.

1048
01:11:07,078 --> 01:11:10,280
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay, I've been seeing people with this drink behind, I've been moderately curious.

1049
01:11:10,320 --> 01:11:13,262
[SPEAKER_27]: Maybe I should have Jonas plug, because he's the one that really is the master of balls.

1050
01:11:13,282 --> 01:11:15,084
[SPEAKER_19]: I used to work at GNC.

1051
01:11:15,424 --> 01:11:18,947
[SPEAKER_06]: The drink that has high caffeine and it's very good tasting.

1052
01:11:19,047 --> 01:11:24,572
[SPEAKER_19]: Guarana is what they put in all of those ones with ephedra, like in those little natural weight loss things.

1053
01:11:24,592 --> 01:11:27,494
[SPEAKER_19]: It's not necessarily caffeine, it's very like caffeine.

1054
01:11:27,794 --> 01:11:30,036
[SPEAKER_26]: Dead or Alive Volleyball, best game ever.

1055
01:11:30,936 --> 01:11:34,338
[SPEAKER_19]: Actually, it's the game that makes men act like girls.

1056
01:11:35,899 --> 01:11:37,020
[SPEAKER_19]: And I explain it this way.

1057
01:11:37,220 --> 01:11:42,904
[SPEAKER_19]: Because they have to go shopping and buy accessories and know what their favorite colors are and their favorite foods.

1058
01:11:43,384 --> 01:11:45,525
[SPEAKER_19]: And then they give presents to other girls.

1059
01:11:45,685 --> 01:11:47,427
[SPEAKER_26]: Borderline dating sim.

1060
01:11:47,647 --> 01:11:49,268
[SPEAKER_19]: It's a dating sim for lesbians.

1061
01:11:50,408 --> 01:11:51,049
[SPEAKER_26]: Sweet.

1062
01:11:52,150 --> 01:11:53,891
[SPEAKER_19]: It makes men act like lesbians.

1063
01:11:54,971 --> 01:11:55,852
[SPEAKER_19]: DOA Volleyball.

1064
01:11:56,989 --> 01:12:02,971
[SPEAKER_07]: If you like DOA Extreme Beach Volleyball, show the upcoming game that's probably going to come out this year for the Xbox.

1065
01:12:02,991 --> 01:12:04,492
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's called NUDE.

1066
01:12:06,293 --> 01:12:07,713
[SPEAKER_19]: I have that BMX XXX game.

1067
01:12:07,733 --> 01:12:08,693
[SPEAKER_19]: They sent it to us for free.

1068
01:12:10,334 --> 01:12:11,354
[SPEAKER_07]: How's that game anyways?

1069
01:12:12,155 --> 01:12:17,757
[SPEAKER_19]: Actually, as a game, it's not that bad, but it's not the best either.

1070
01:12:21,232 --> 01:12:29,116
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, but we, because Dan manages GameStop, we get all kinds of neat free video games and all kinds of cool swag.

1071
01:12:29,816 --> 01:12:35,019
[SPEAKER_19]: Like, you know, I don't know if you saw my keychain, I have a GameCube keychain and a GBA keychain.

1072
01:12:36,738 --> 01:12:37,678
[SPEAKER_19]: Lovely Brad, lovely.

1073
01:12:38,858 --> 01:12:40,419
[SPEAKER_19]: In case people missed it, Brad belched.

1074
01:12:40,699 --> 01:12:40,999
[SPEAKER_19]: Anyway.

1075
01:12:42,119 --> 01:12:44,540
[SPEAKER_27]: Alright, are you guys ready to get to the interviews?

1076
01:12:44,560 --> 01:12:44,680
[SPEAKER_19]: No.

1077
01:12:44,720 --> 01:12:45,640
[SPEAKER_27]: Okay, Jamie.

1078
01:12:46,060 --> 01:12:47,720
[SPEAKER_19]: But we get free games every so often.

1079
01:12:48,460 --> 01:12:50,121
[SPEAKER_19]: And we get, like, porn games.

1080
01:12:50,281 --> 01:12:54,202
[SPEAKER_27]: Alright, you guys ready?

1081
01:12:54,782 --> 01:12:55,162
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

1082
01:12:55,762 --> 01:12:56,602
[SPEAKER_27]: Alright, here we go.

1083
01:12:56,742 --> 01:12:59,043
[SPEAKER_27]: We're going to do the Milpitas Golf Land interviews.

1084
01:12:59,263 --> 01:12:59,783
[SPEAKER_27]: Enjoy.

1085
01:12:59,803 --> 01:13:00,123
[SPEAKER_27]: Yay.

1086
01:13:14,693 --> 01:13:20,176
[SPEAKER_18]: Do little buttons in front of you and it's a whip and a hold or something, a bridle, I don't know what that crap is.

1087
01:13:21,176 --> 01:13:23,157
[SPEAKER_18]: And you sit there and you whip the hell out of your horse.

1088
01:13:23,377 --> 01:13:24,598
[SPEAKER_18]: And if you win, you get really excited.

1089
01:13:24,618 --> 01:13:26,578
[SPEAKER_27]: Okay, I don't know what happened at the beginning of that interview.

1090
01:13:26,759 --> 01:13:27,259
[SPEAKER_27]: That's weird.

1091
01:13:27,299 --> 01:13:28,419
[SPEAKER_27]: It kind of cuts in the middle there.

1092
01:13:28,439 --> 01:13:31,961
[SPEAKER_27]: But we're talking to Melody, also known as Shark's Girl, about Derby Owners Club.

1093
01:13:32,201 --> 01:13:32,701
[SPEAKER_27]: That's kind of weird.

1094
01:13:32,921 --> 01:13:34,522
[SPEAKER_27]: She's explaining what Derby Owners Club is all about.

1095
01:13:34,622 --> 01:13:35,062
[SPEAKER_27]: Sorry about that.

1096
01:13:35,443 --> 01:13:36,403
[SPEAKER_18]: You say, I want to do it again.

1097
01:13:36,843 --> 01:13:38,844
[SPEAKER_18]: And if you lose, you say, I have to do it again because I have to win.

1098
01:13:38,944 --> 01:13:39,985
[SPEAKER_18]: And suddenly, you're down $100.

1099
01:13:41,428 --> 01:13:43,689
[SPEAKER_27]: I won a race earlier and I nearly wet my pants.

1100
01:13:43,729 --> 01:13:44,429
[SPEAKER_27]: I was so excited.

1101
01:13:44,709 --> 01:13:45,570
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, and you beat me.

1102
01:13:46,670 --> 01:13:51,492
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm sorry, but I beat my horse more than I beat you, if that's any consolation.

1103
01:13:52,452 --> 01:13:54,353
[SPEAKER_27]: I leave the beating to somebody else.

1104
01:13:55,014 --> 01:13:58,895
[SPEAKER_18]: I guess I'll forgive you for that, and I'm just going to leave that comment right alone.

1105
01:13:59,115 --> 01:13:59,936
[SPEAKER_27]: You're so kind.

1106
01:14:00,256 --> 01:14:02,276
[SPEAKER_27]: Oh, isn't there some DDR thing going on here today, too?

1107
01:14:02,577 --> 01:14:03,297
[SPEAKER_27]: A DDR tournament?

1108
01:14:03,317 --> 01:14:03,697
[SPEAKER_27]: What's that?

1109
01:14:03,757 --> 01:14:05,878
[SPEAKER_27]: Oh, yeah, there's a DDR tournament going on in the other room.

1110
01:14:07,310 --> 01:14:08,591
[SPEAKER_27]: Is that why you're here tonight?

1111
01:14:08,611 --> 01:14:11,093
[SPEAKER_27]: Are you going to be participating in anything?

1112
01:14:11,133 --> 01:14:12,394
[SPEAKER_27]: Are you just here to cheer people on?

1113
01:14:13,074 --> 01:14:14,175
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm just kind of here to watch.

1114
01:14:14,215 --> 01:14:16,637
[SPEAKER_18]: This time I'm not doing anything.

1115
01:14:16,957 --> 01:14:18,478
[SPEAKER_18]: Not going to do that for a little while.

1116
01:14:18,538 --> 01:14:23,521
[SPEAKER_18]: But yeah, I just kind of wanted to see what's going on and catch more Xtreme because I still haven't heard many of the songs on it.

1117
01:14:24,042 --> 01:14:25,162
[SPEAKER_27]: I think that's pretty much me too.

1118
01:14:25,423 --> 01:14:29,005
[SPEAKER_27]: You know, if you listen to Orange Lounge from Monty Music and more, you're going to hear lots of stuff from Xtreme.

1119
01:14:29,405 --> 01:14:30,386
[SPEAKER_27]: Wink, wink, nudge, nudge, plug.

1120
01:14:30,891 --> 01:14:35,594
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, you know, I kind of have this little thing called a life that really keeps me... Hey!

1121
01:14:35,874 --> 01:14:36,054
[SPEAKER_18]: Hey!

1122
01:14:36,534 --> 01:14:37,615
[SPEAKER_27]: I don't like where you're going with that, Missy.

1123
01:14:38,135 --> 01:14:38,915
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, well, how about this?

1124
01:14:39,035 --> 01:14:41,096
[SPEAKER_18]: I have a really slow freaking connection.

1125
01:14:42,117 --> 01:14:42,997
[SPEAKER_27]: Okay, fair enough.

1126
01:14:43,958 --> 01:14:44,878
[SPEAKER_27]: Fine, be that way.

1127
01:14:45,139 --> 01:14:46,039
[SPEAKER_27]: Fine, we understand.

1128
01:14:46,659 --> 01:14:47,540
[SPEAKER_27]: I don't want to talk to you no more.

1129
01:14:47,580 --> 01:14:49,261
[SPEAKER_27]: Let's talk to this person sitting across the table.

1130
01:14:49,541 --> 01:14:49,961
[SPEAKER_27]: Say hello.

1131
01:14:50,321 --> 01:14:50,782
[SPEAKER_17]: Hi.

1132
01:14:51,162 --> 01:14:51,882
[SPEAKER_27]: What's your name?

1133
01:14:52,342 --> 01:14:52,943
[SPEAKER_17]: Uh, Ron.

1134
01:14:53,583 --> 01:14:55,284
[SPEAKER_27]: And do you have an online name that you buy?

1135
01:14:55,304 --> 01:14:56,224
[SPEAKER_17]: Uke Bondage Boy.

1136
01:14:56,885 --> 01:14:57,365
[SPEAKER_27]: Right on.

1137
01:14:57,565 --> 01:14:59,106
[SPEAKER_27]: What brings you to today's lovely tournament?

1138
01:14:59,881 --> 01:15:01,683
[SPEAKER_17]: Being cheerleader for my aniki.

1139
01:15:02,523 --> 01:15:02,924
[SPEAKER_27]: Right on.

1140
01:15:02,984 --> 01:15:04,445
[SPEAKER_27]: So you're not going to be participating?

1141
01:15:04,485 --> 01:15:07,287
[SPEAKER_27]: Are you going to get up there and actually cheerlead while there's a routine going on?

1142
01:15:07,727 --> 01:15:08,008
[SPEAKER_17]: No.

1143
01:15:09,189 --> 01:15:11,050
[SPEAKER_27]: Do you think Parapara is anything like cheerleading?

1144
01:15:12,051 --> 01:15:12,972
[SPEAKER_17]: Somewhat, yeah.

1145
01:15:13,752 --> 01:15:14,533
[SPEAKER_27]: Do you own any boots?

1146
01:15:15,834 --> 01:15:16,194
[SPEAKER_27]: Boots?

1147
01:15:16,514 --> 01:15:19,016
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah, you know, like Parapara boots, the big silver boots that come up to your knees?

1148
01:15:19,497 --> 01:15:21,899
[SPEAKER_17]: No, I have big black boots with lots of buckles.

1149
01:15:22,359 --> 01:15:22,900
[SPEAKER_27]: That's where you go.

1150
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:24,081
[SPEAKER_27]: Oh, hence the name Bondage.

1151
01:15:24,721 --> 01:15:24,981
[SPEAKER_17]: Yep.

1152
01:15:25,502 --> 01:15:27,163
[SPEAKER_27]: So why do you go by Bondage Boy?

1153
01:15:27,363 --> 01:15:28,264
[SPEAKER_27]: Is it just, you like...

1154
01:15:29,336 --> 01:15:35,681
[SPEAKER_17]: It was actually a joke because most people when I talk to them online, I don't tell them that I'm female right away.

1155
01:15:35,701 --> 01:15:42,086
[SPEAKER_17]: Because a lot of Yaoi fans are female and they're all into the whole female-female relationship.

1156
01:15:42,146 --> 01:15:44,648
[SPEAKER_17]: So I don't need any extra baggage like that.

1157
01:15:45,409 --> 01:15:46,510
[SPEAKER_27]: So you're into the Yaoi, huh?

1158
01:15:46,930 --> 01:15:47,351
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, yes.

1159
01:15:47,711 --> 01:15:49,712
[SPEAKER_27]: So is the lovely Jamie who couldn't be here tonight.

1160
01:15:49,732 --> 01:15:52,074
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm sure you two could talk about Yaoi all night long.

1161
01:15:52,695 --> 01:15:53,455
[SPEAKER_17]: We often do.

1162
01:15:53,836 --> 01:15:54,196
[SPEAKER_27]: Right on.

1163
01:15:54,316 --> 01:15:54,857
[SPEAKER_27]: Yes, yes.

1164
01:15:55,677 --> 01:15:56,518
[SPEAKER_27]: What's your favorite Yaoi?

1165
01:15:57,556 --> 01:15:59,757
[SPEAKER_17]: Um, I don't have a favorite right now.

1166
01:15:59,817 --> 01:16:06,319
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm like really into Xenogears because I just started playing it and Initial D. Initial D. Cool.

1167
01:16:06,339 --> 01:16:09,520
[SPEAKER_27]: What if they did like Initial D Yaoi that's like kind of role playing?

1168
01:16:09,540 --> 01:16:10,500
[SPEAKER_27]: Would that be like the shit?

1169
01:16:11,080 --> 01:16:12,581
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, I already kind of do that.

1170
01:16:13,121 --> 01:16:13,881
[SPEAKER_27]: Oh, right on.

1171
01:16:13,941 --> 01:16:14,261
[SPEAKER_27]: Cool.

1172
01:16:14,841 --> 01:16:16,962
[SPEAKER_27]: Well, anything else you want to say to lovely listeners of Orange Launch Radio?

1173
01:16:18,439 --> 01:16:20,100
[SPEAKER_17]: Have fun listening.

1174
01:16:20,380 --> 01:16:21,100
[SPEAKER_17]: I can't listen.

1175
01:16:21,380 --> 01:16:22,900
[SPEAKER_17]: My computer doesn't like streaming.

1176
01:16:23,580 --> 01:16:24,240
[SPEAKER_27]: That's okay.

1177
01:16:24,300 --> 01:16:24,821
[SPEAKER_27]: We forgive you.

1178
01:16:24,961 --> 01:16:25,761
[SPEAKER_27]: But thanks for being on the show.

1179
01:16:26,161 --> 01:16:26,801
[SPEAKER_17]: Not a problem.

1180
01:16:27,181 --> 01:16:27,481
[SPEAKER_27]: Cool.

1181
01:16:28,001 --> 01:16:31,382
[SPEAKER_27]: Also joining us, we're joined by a few good men here at the table.

1182
01:16:31,742 --> 01:16:32,662
[SPEAKER_27]: Say hello, everybody.

1183
01:16:33,082 --> 01:16:35,003
[SPEAKER_27]: I hope he doesn't mind me shoving the microphone in his face.

1184
01:16:35,083 --> 01:16:37,143
[SPEAKER_27]: It's Mr. Wendell.

1185
01:16:38,643 --> 01:16:40,664
[SPEAKER_27]: You just say that so erotically.

1186
01:16:42,024 --> 01:16:43,464
[SPEAKER_27]: I was coming off a yaoi high.

1187
01:16:43,484 --> 01:16:43,885
[SPEAKER_27]: What can I say?

1188
01:16:43,905 --> 01:16:44,705
[SPEAKER_27]: I said coming.

1189
01:16:48,322 --> 01:16:49,564
[SPEAKER_27]: You make my nipples so hard now.

1190
01:16:52,470 --> 01:16:54,614
[SPEAKER_27]: So are you going to be participating in today's tournament?

1191
01:16:55,356 --> 01:16:56,758
[SPEAKER_27]: I will participate...

1192
01:16:57,894 --> 01:17:01,816
[SPEAKER_27]: I'll be it, not necessarily be all that great, but hey, hey, that rhymed.

1193
01:17:02,917 --> 01:17:05,718
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah, I'll enter improv freestyle just for the heck of it, you know.

1194
01:17:06,298 --> 01:17:07,039
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm sure it'll be fun.

1195
01:17:07,599 --> 01:17:12,842
[SPEAKER_27]: Now, how do you approach improv freestyle as opposed to routine freestyle, with the obvious exception of you don't really plan in advance?

1196
01:17:12,862 --> 01:17:14,623
[SPEAKER_27]: Do you go in a different mindset when you get there?

1197
01:17:15,863 --> 01:17:18,465
[SPEAKER_12]: You never really know what song you're going to get.

1198
01:17:18,605 --> 01:17:22,447
[SPEAKER_12]: You just got to go with what you got, try to do what you can.

1199
01:17:22,467 --> 01:17:24,408
[SPEAKER_24]: Let's hear that comment for the listeners.

1200
01:17:28,450 --> 01:17:29,211
[SPEAKER_27]: I fuckin' forgot.

1201
01:17:29,972 --> 01:17:30,753
[SPEAKER_27]: And who are you, good sir?

1202
01:17:30,773 --> 01:17:33,735
[SPEAKER_27]: I want that one, Bobby!

1203
01:17:33,775 --> 01:17:34,276
[SPEAKER_27]: Shut up, dude.

1204
01:17:34,296 --> 01:17:35,217
[SPEAKER_27]: That's a hella cool name.

1205
01:17:35,397 --> 01:17:35,937
[SPEAKER_27]: Fuzzy Hat.

1206
01:17:36,197 --> 01:17:36,978
[SPEAKER_27]: Hello, Fuzzy Hat.

1207
01:17:36,998 --> 01:17:38,019
[SPEAKER_27]: What brings you to today's tournament?

1208
01:17:41,462 --> 01:17:43,244
[SPEAKER_27]: Um, it's either this or go to Dave & Buster's.

1209
01:17:44,705 --> 01:17:47,027
[SPEAKER_27]: Oh, you're here for Derby Owners Club, too, then?

1210
01:17:47,568 --> 01:17:49,750
[SPEAKER_27]: No, I get Derby Owners Club for free at Dave & Buster's.

1211
01:17:50,370 --> 01:17:50,791
[SPEAKER_27]: Oh!

1212
01:17:51,191 --> 01:17:51,732
[SPEAKER_27]: Oh, I see.

1213
01:17:52,152 --> 01:17:53,173
[SPEAKER_27]: Are you going to be participating?

1214
01:17:55,887 --> 01:17:57,448
[SPEAKER_27]: Are you going to be participating in Improv 2?

1215
01:17:57,828 --> 01:17:58,269
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah.

1216
01:17:58,789 --> 01:18:00,410
[SPEAKER_27]: Now what happens if you get Baby Baby Love Me?

1217
01:18:01,351 --> 01:18:05,093
[SPEAKER_27]: It'll be hella awesome.

1218
01:18:05,173 --> 01:18:06,474
[SPEAKER_27]: Will it be erotic and sensuous?

1219
01:18:06,854 --> 01:18:08,516
[SPEAKER_27]: No, it'll just be hella awesome.

1220
01:18:08,536 --> 01:18:08,936
[SPEAKER_27]: Sounds good.

1221
01:18:13,359 --> 01:18:14,580
[SPEAKER_27]: Well, good luck to you both.

1222
01:18:14,660 --> 01:18:15,020
[SPEAKER_27]: Good luck.

1223
01:18:15,800 --> 01:18:18,622
[SPEAKER_27]: Also over here, let's say hello to an old favorite of the show as well.

1224
01:18:18,903 --> 01:18:19,503
[SPEAKER_27]: Say hello to MLB.

1225
01:18:20,544 --> 01:18:22,365
[SPEAKER_27]: Hello, buddy.

1226
01:18:24,296 --> 01:18:27,319
[SPEAKER_03]: And what brings you to today's tournament?

1227
01:18:27,780 --> 01:18:28,240
[SPEAKER_03]: Intrigue.

1228
01:18:28,741 --> 01:18:39,252
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just kind of interesting to see after all the ranting and raving there's been going on between preparedness and improv routines, there's a competition catered to the improv kind.

1229
01:18:39,612 --> 01:18:41,615
[SPEAKER_03]: So do you think something like this was needed for the community?

1230
01:18:42,976 --> 01:18:44,558
[SPEAKER_03]: I think improv is...

1231
01:18:45,889 --> 01:18:50,674
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just as important to freestyle as prepared routines are.

1232
01:18:51,015 --> 01:18:53,377
[SPEAKER_03]: There are some people who prefer the former over the latter.

1233
01:18:53,397 --> 01:18:57,842
[SPEAKER_03]: There are some who think that someone who has raw talent should be able to win every tourney.

1234
01:18:58,122 --> 01:19:01,546
[SPEAKER_03]: This is one for argument's sake, if nothing else.

1235
01:19:02,587 --> 01:19:03,828
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're not going to be participating, though?

1236
01:19:04,649 --> 01:19:15,778
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I would, but it's like, I gotta save my goods up for the CBN coming up in a couple weeks, and it's like, if I, you know, blow my wad now, I'll be shooting blanks at CBN, and then, you know, what happens there?

1237
01:19:16,379 --> 01:19:18,200
[SPEAKER_03]: Heaven forbid, Mel Blank.

1238
01:19:19,701 --> 01:19:21,303
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's what the B will stand for.

1239
01:19:24,325 --> 01:19:25,166
[SPEAKER_09]: That's all, folks!

1240
01:19:26,947 --> 01:19:31,831
[SPEAKER_27]: On that note, I think this interview is going to come to a close, but do you guys have any final thoughts, anything you guys want to say to listeners, Orange Ons?

1241
01:19:33,149 --> 01:19:37,893
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, uh, go out there, have some fun, and where's the beer?

1242
01:19:39,234 --> 01:19:39,914
[SPEAKER_27]: Where is the beer?

1243
01:19:39,955 --> 01:19:40,955
[SPEAKER_27]: That's a very good question.

1244
01:19:41,836 --> 01:19:50,023
[SPEAKER_27]: Jamie, Jamie's, the lovely DarkSakura, who couldn't be here tonight, unfortunately, is going to be getting drunk on the show, I believe, the next week's show.

1245
01:19:50,043 --> 01:19:52,104
[SPEAKER_27]: While I'm away at CyberBeat Nation, she's going to help me get drunk.

1246
01:19:52,424 --> 01:19:54,826
[SPEAKER_27]: I love you, DarkSakura.

1247
01:19:56,027 --> 01:19:57,889
[SPEAKER_13]: You should have been here.

1248
01:20:00,171 --> 01:20:01,772
[SPEAKER_27]: Wait, Jamie, I want to interrupt and say something.

1249
01:20:02,345 --> 01:20:05,908
[SPEAKER_19]: Um, I will be getting drunk and DarkSakura will be getting drunk with me.

1250
01:20:07,029 --> 01:20:07,390
[SPEAKER_27]: Word.

1251
01:20:07,790 --> 01:20:10,773
[SPEAKER_19]: And our static problem got worse.

1252
01:20:11,113 --> 01:20:12,654
[SPEAKER_27]: Damn it, our static problem.

1253
01:20:12,694 --> 01:20:22,163
[SPEAKER_26]: I won't be getting drunk, I don't think, because I don't drink and I'm kind of afraid to drink because since I'd be such a lightweight, you know, getting sick and then possibly violent, you know, who knows.

1254
01:20:22,743 --> 01:20:24,285
[SPEAKER_27]: You're going to be around two drunk women.

1255
01:20:25,037 --> 01:20:25,277
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

1256
01:20:25,998 --> 01:20:27,659
[SPEAKER_19]: We're going to be, like, laughing our asses off.

1257
01:20:27,679 --> 01:20:31,020
[SPEAKER_27]: Too bad there's no, like, attraction or anything, or you could be in the middle of a lesbian sandwich.

1258
01:20:31,201 --> 01:20:31,701
[SPEAKER_27]: No!

1259
01:20:32,782 --> 01:20:33,742
[SPEAKER_27]: All right, back to the interviews.

1260
01:20:35,943 --> 01:20:37,224
[SPEAKER_27]: It's called work, and it's evil.

1261
01:20:41,046 --> 01:20:41,987
[SPEAKER_27]: Any final thoughts from LB?

1262
01:20:43,147 --> 01:20:44,408
[SPEAKER_03]: RTF World domination.

1263
01:20:44,728 --> 01:20:46,509
[SPEAKER_03]: Give us your finest meats and cheeses.

1264
01:20:47,550 --> 01:20:48,571
[SPEAKER_03]: Any final words from Shark Skrull?

1265
01:20:49,191 --> 01:20:50,412
[SPEAKER_18]: Say no to derby owner crack.

1266
01:20:51,192 --> 01:20:53,093
[SPEAKER_27]: And even though I already asked her anything from Bondage Boy?

1267
01:20:54,134 --> 01:20:54,234
[SPEAKER_17]: Um...

1268
01:20:55,057 --> 01:20:55,477
[SPEAKER_17]: Not really.

1269
01:20:55,877 --> 01:20:56,718
[SPEAKER_27]: I love your hair, by the way.

1270
01:20:57,058 --> 01:20:57,518
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1271
01:20:57,758 --> 01:20:58,518
[SPEAKER_17]: It's fake.

1272
01:20:59,019 --> 01:20:59,499
[SPEAKER_17]: It's fake.

1273
01:20:59,599 --> 01:21:00,519
[SPEAKER_27]: It's smurfalicious.

1274
01:21:01,039 --> 01:21:01,519
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.

1275
01:21:02,460 --> 01:21:03,860
[SPEAKER_27]: All right, more interviews to come later.

1276
01:21:05,001 --> 01:21:10,623
[SPEAKER_27]: And now joining us at the table, the ever so lovely tonight's, introduce yourself, kind lady.

1277
01:21:10,643 --> 01:21:12,764
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, I'm Jenny Bean.

1278
01:21:12,964 --> 01:21:13,784
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, everyone?

1279
01:21:13,864 --> 01:21:15,225
[SPEAKER_27]: How are you doing tonight?

1280
01:21:15,245 --> 01:21:16,305
[SPEAKER_27]: What brings you to Milpitas tonight?

1281
01:21:16,843 --> 01:21:18,685
[SPEAKER_00]: The wonderful tournament that Milton's running.

1282
01:21:19,325 --> 01:21:19,626
[SPEAKER_27]: Right on.

1283
01:21:19,646 --> 01:21:20,767
[SPEAKER_27]: Are you going to be participating?

1284
01:21:20,827 --> 01:21:21,788
[SPEAKER_27]: Are you judging or what's going on?

1285
01:21:22,048 --> 01:21:22,589
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm judging.

1286
01:21:23,389 --> 01:21:24,731
[SPEAKER_27]: Now, okay, I haven't talked to a judge yet.

1287
01:21:24,751 --> 01:21:27,053
[SPEAKER_27]: What are you going to be looking for in tonight's improv?

1288
01:21:27,957 --> 01:21:30,259
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, it's harder to judge improv, I think.

1289
01:21:30,519 --> 01:21:32,481
[SPEAKER_00]: But, um, I don't know.

1290
01:21:32,641 --> 01:21:35,223
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just looking for a good flow of routines and all that.

1291
01:21:35,843 --> 01:21:37,465
[SPEAKER_00]: The normal stuff.

1292
01:21:37,505 --> 01:21:38,806
[SPEAKER_27]: Now, I know you can't play favorites.

1293
01:21:38,826 --> 01:21:41,768
[SPEAKER_27]: Was there any particular person you're looking forward to seeing do an improv routine?

1294
01:21:42,208 --> 01:21:42,589
[SPEAKER_00]: Not really.

1295
01:21:42,669 --> 01:21:46,532
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, I guess Fuzzy Hat, because I like his improv routines.

1296
01:21:46,592 --> 01:21:47,573
[SPEAKER_00]: I think he's pretty good at them.

1297
01:21:47,593 --> 01:21:48,674
[SPEAKER_27]: He does some pretty good shit.

1298
01:21:49,234 --> 01:21:50,755
[SPEAKER_27]: We're hoping he gets Baby Baby Love Me.

1299
01:21:51,175 --> 01:21:52,196
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be cool!

1300
01:21:53,593 --> 01:21:56,014
[SPEAKER_27]: Anything else you want to say to the listeners of Orange Launch Radio?

1301
01:21:56,074 --> 01:22:00,177
[SPEAKER_27]: And DarkSakura and Loki, they're in the studio, couldn't be here tonight.

1302
01:22:00,397 --> 01:22:03,278
[SPEAKER_00]: Hello to all of them and hello to everyone who's listening.

1303
01:22:05,099 --> 01:22:07,221
[SPEAKER_27]: Any words of wisdom for Bomani players out there?

1304
01:22:08,741 --> 01:22:11,583
[SPEAKER_27]: Any new people that want to start improv freestyling?

1305
01:22:14,024 --> 01:22:14,945
[SPEAKER_00]: Watch videos.

1306
01:22:16,325 --> 01:22:16,986
[SPEAKER_27]: Sounds good.

1307
01:22:17,206 --> 01:22:17,606
[SPEAKER_27]: All right.

1308
01:22:18,026 --> 01:22:18,867
[SPEAKER_27]: More interviews to come.

1309
01:22:22,020 --> 01:22:28,362
[SPEAKER_27]: Alright, a little bit of time has passed, and PA's over now, and I had a second to step outside with this fine gentleman.

1310
01:22:28,402 --> 01:22:29,823
[SPEAKER_27]: Introduce yourself for all the Orange Islands listeners.

1311
01:22:30,423 --> 01:22:33,284
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm Milton, aka Maple, the tournament organizer of NorCal.

1312
01:22:33,764 --> 01:22:34,304
[SPEAKER_27]: Right on!

1313
01:22:34,384 --> 01:22:36,245
[SPEAKER_27]: So, what made you decide to do a tournament today?

1314
01:22:37,566 --> 01:22:43,348
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, Xtreme came out a month ago, and I promised Paul, as well as a lot of other people, that I'd throw a tournament one month after we got Xtreme.

1315
01:22:43,868 --> 01:22:45,408
[SPEAKER_05]: So, a month later, tournament.

1316
01:22:46,028 --> 01:22:46,369
[SPEAKER_05]: How's it going?

1317
01:22:46,389 --> 01:22:47,249
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys happy with the turnout?

1318
01:22:48,112 --> 01:22:48,672
[SPEAKER_05]: Turnout, yes.

1319
01:22:48,993 --> 01:22:51,694
[SPEAKER_27]: We didn't think it would be this many people, but then people surprised us.

1320
01:22:52,054 --> 01:22:53,715
[SPEAKER_27]: Last minute people come and, you know.

1321
01:22:54,356 --> 01:22:54,696
[SPEAKER_27]: Right on.

1322
01:22:54,716 --> 01:22:58,318
[SPEAKER_27]: So what made you guys decide to do an improv freestyle as opposed to the typical routine freestyle?

1323
01:22:58,858 --> 01:23:01,640
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, honestly, out of all my tournaments, I've never run improv.

1324
01:23:01,700 --> 01:23:03,221
[SPEAKER_05]: It's always been routine freestyle.

1325
01:23:04,001 --> 01:23:11,566
[SPEAKER_05]: And a person, Jason Rain, or Rain on the boards as you may know, he brought to my attention that, you know, there should be improv, just improv against routine.

1326
01:23:12,228 --> 01:23:17,212
[SPEAKER_05]: So I decided to throw improv freestyle, and then a lot of people entered, you know, people supported, some people didn't support it.

1327
01:23:17,672 --> 01:23:20,354
[SPEAKER_05]: And besides, I didn't want to have a routine freestyle with CBN coming up so soon.

1328
01:23:21,254 --> 01:23:26,078
[SPEAKER_27]: That's what a lot of people have been saying, is that they're kind of glad that it didn't happen because they're saving their routines for CyberBeat, so I'll be going.

1329
01:23:26,118 --> 01:23:27,139
[SPEAKER_27]: So you're going to be going to CyberBeat?

1330
01:23:27,519 --> 01:23:27,819
[SPEAKER_27]: Of course.

1331
01:23:28,179 --> 01:23:29,260
[SPEAKER_27]: Alright, looking forward to that.

1332
01:23:29,760 --> 01:23:35,524
[SPEAKER_27]: So how many tournaments have you, in the past year, how many tournaments have you had a hand in running, do you think?

1333
01:23:36,205 --> 01:23:37,326
[SPEAKER_22]: In running or helping with?

1334
01:23:39,087 --> 01:23:40,448
[SPEAKER_05]: Both, if you can recall either.

1335
01:23:43,422 --> 01:23:46,385
[SPEAKER_05]: Everything from Fremont to now, excluding Spiegel 2.

1336
01:23:47,966 --> 01:23:48,507
[SPEAKER_27]: Everything.

1337
01:23:49,508 --> 01:23:50,048
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm pretty sure.

1338
01:23:50,088 --> 01:23:50,889
[SPEAKER_27]: In NorCal.

1339
01:23:51,109 --> 01:23:52,310
[SPEAKER_27]: That's a whole lot of tournaments.

1340
01:23:53,371 --> 01:23:55,853
[SPEAKER_27]: Wait, you haven't actually judged a tournament in a while, though.

1341
01:23:55,873 --> 01:23:56,834
[SPEAKER_27]: That's kind of a break for you.

1342
01:23:57,014 --> 01:24:01,098
[SPEAKER_27]: Well, I judged MGL Evil Tournament 2, which was December 13th.

1343
01:24:01,778 --> 01:24:05,482
[SPEAKER_27]: What kind of things do you think the judges will be looking for tonight in Improv Freestyles post-routine freestyle?

1344
01:24:06,262 --> 01:24:06,583
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, for...

1345
01:24:07,375 --> 01:24:08,116
[SPEAKER_05]: We're from Freestyle.

1346
01:24:08,536 --> 01:24:13,159
[SPEAKER_05]: This time I have seven judges, and they're each judging a category.

1347
01:24:13,700 --> 01:24:20,305
[SPEAKER_05]: For example, one of them is judging on energy, one of them is judging on power moves, other one is judging on arrow flexibility, which is how to use the arrows.

1348
01:24:21,226 --> 01:24:23,347
[SPEAKER_05]: Any other upcoming events you want to let our listeners know about?

1349
01:24:24,388 --> 01:24:24,668
[SPEAKER_05]: Not really.

1350
01:24:24,688 --> 01:24:28,971
[SPEAKER_05]: The only thing I know about is CBN in February, and then March Madness in March, and then Pride V3 in May.

1351
01:24:29,152 --> 01:24:32,995
[SPEAKER_05]: I think May 18th and 19th, I'm pretty sure, or the weekend around there.

1352
01:24:33,215 --> 01:24:34,536
[SPEAKER_05]: And then as for summer, I don't know.

1353
01:24:34,616 --> 01:24:35,837
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think Spiegel 3.

1354
01:24:36,989 --> 01:24:37,389
[SPEAKER_05]: Right, Corey?

1355
01:24:38,650 --> 01:24:39,110
[SPEAKER_05]: Supposedly.

1356
01:24:39,130 --> 01:24:39,650
[SPEAKER_27]: Supposedly.

1357
01:24:39,790 --> 01:24:40,631
[SPEAKER_27]: Big question mark.

1358
01:24:40,791 --> 01:24:41,511
[SPEAKER_27]: You're here first.

1359
01:24:41,851 --> 01:24:42,191
[SPEAKER_27]: Or second.

1360
01:24:42,291 --> 01:24:43,392
[SPEAKER_27]: Or third.

1361
01:24:44,532 --> 01:24:47,354
[SPEAKER_27]: Anything else you want to say to listeners?

1362
01:24:47,374 --> 01:24:47,834
[SPEAKER_27]: Okay, yes.

1363
01:24:48,254 --> 01:24:51,796
[SPEAKER_05]: What about the other 13 categories you mentioned to me earlier?

1364
01:24:52,736 --> 01:24:53,396
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you mean by them?

1365
01:24:53,536 --> 01:24:54,017
[SPEAKER_05]: You said you had 20!

1366
01:24:54,057 --> 01:24:55,597
[SPEAKER_05]: I had 20, yes.

1367
01:24:55,717 --> 01:24:57,598
[SPEAKER_05]: But I had to cut down.

1368
01:24:58,179 --> 01:25:01,260
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't want more judges than there are entries in the tournament.

1369
01:25:03,121 --> 01:25:03,721
[SPEAKER_05]: I understand.

1370
01:25:04,501 --> 01:25:04,822
[SPEAKER_05]: Dismissed!

1371
01:25:06,164 --> 01:25:08,265
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for joining us today.

1372
01:25:08,365 --> 01:25:08,785
[SPEAKER_05]: No problem.

1373
01:25:08,805 --> 01:25:11,567
[SPEAKER_05]: Good luck with the rest of the tournament.

1374
01:25:11,967 --> 01:25:13,067
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, thanks.

1375
01:25:13,087 --> 01:25:15,289
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so we got another interview here.

1376
01:25:15,329 --> 01:25:16,989
[SPEAKER_05]: Introduce yourself for our listeners.

1377
01:25:33,104 --> 01:25:33,404
[SPEAKER_06]: Axel?

1378
01:25:33,804 --> 01:25:34,165
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1379
01:25:34,445 --> 01:25:34,925
[SPEAKER_27]: Hi guys.

1380
01:25:35,585 --> 01:25:35,985
[SPEAKER_27]: What's up?

1381
01:25:36,005 --> 01:25:36,405
[SPEAKER_27]: Where you from?

1382
01:25:36,706 --> 01:25:37,146
[SPEAKER_27]: Stockton.

1383
01:25:37,746 --> 01:25:39,907
[SPEAKER_27]: What brings you to the Milpitas Tournament this evening?

1384
01:25:40,807 --> 01:25:43,929
[SPEAKER_23]: To see my buddy Milton and John, Virtue.

1385
01:25:44,209 --> 01:25:44,709
[SPEAKER_23]: Don't lie.

1386
01:25:44,969 --> 01:25:46,950
[SPEAKER_23]: The rest of the Killer Pals and Samantha.

1387
01:25:48,390 --> 01:25:49,511
[SPEAKER_23]: Are you participating in anything tonight?

1388
01:25:49,531 --> 01:25:49,911
[SPEAKER_23]: PA?

1389
01:25:50,171 --> 01:25:50,331
[SPEAKER_23]: Improv?

1390
01:25:50,351 --> 01:25:51,292
[SPEAKER_23]: Oh yeah, I did PA.

1391
01:25:51,572 --> 01:25:52,012
[SPEAKER_23]: How'd you do?

1392
01:25:52,792 --> 01:25:53,833
[SPEAKER_06]: Lost first round to Tigger.

1393
01:25:54,333 --> 01:25:54,573
[SPEAKER_06]: Dope.

1394
01:25:55,533 --> 01:25:56,114
[SPEAKER_06]: Very dope.

1395
01:25:56,994 --> 01:25:58,155
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, I'm off then too.

1396
01:25:58,355 --> 01:25:59,015
[SPEAKER_06]: What was the song?

1397
01:26:00,290 --> 01:26:01,571
[SPEAKER_06]: What was it?

1398
01:26:01,631 --> 01:26:02,631
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a gentle stress.

1399
01:26:03,292 --> 01:26:03,572
[SPEAKER_27]: Bummer.

1400
01:26:04,472 --> 01:26:07,954
[SPEAKER_27]: So you're not going to be doing freestyle?

1401
01:26:07,974 --> 01:26:08,474
[SPEAKER_27]: You're watching?

1402
01:26:09,015 --> 01:26:09,475
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm leaving.

1403
01:26:10,035 --> 01:26:10,635
[SPEAKER_27]: You're leaving?

1404
01:26:12,036 --> 01:26:12,857
[SPEAKER_27]: Is it hard to get to?

1405
01:26:12,877 --> 01:26:14,797
[SPEAKER_27]: You said you were having problems getting a ride over here?

1406
01:26:15,618 --> 01:26:15,958
[SPEAKER_27]: Yes.

1407
01:26:16,298 --> 01:26:18,259
[SPEAKER_27]: No one is willing to really take me.

1408
01:26:18,639 --> 01:26:21,901
[SPEAKER_27]: Tell us about the DDR scene in Stockton because we don't talk to many people from there.

1409
01:26:22,221 --> 01:26:27,784
[SPEAKER_27]: We've talked about Stockton Golf Land on the show because we refer to it as Ghetto Golf Land, but...

1410
01:26:28,647 --> 01:26:29,508
[SPEAKER_27]: It is pretty ghetto.

1411
01:26:30,929 --> 01:26:32,731
[SPEAKER_27]: If you want to get shot, then that's the place to go.

1412
01:26:32,951 --> 01:26:34,592
[SPEAKER_27]: Have you ever seen anyone get killed at Golf Line?

1413
01:26:34,793 --> 01:26:36,194
[SPEAKER_06]: No, but I've witnessed a shooting.

1414
01:26:36,514 --> 01:26:38,055
[SPEAKER_27]: Have you ever wanted to kill somebody at Golf Line?

1415
01:26:38,416 --> 01:26:38,776
[SPEAKER_23]: Not me.

1416
01:26:39,296 --> 01:26:40,958
[SPEAKER_27]: Those little kids are fucking mean.

1417
01:26:41,038 --> 01:26:41,939
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah, I know.

1418
01:26:41,999 --> 01:26:42,800
[SPEAKER_23]: Every day I want to kill them.

1419
01:26:43,060 --> 01:26:43,780
[SPEAKER_23]: They ask for tokens.

1420
01:26:44,841 --> 01:26:45,702
[SPEAKER_23]: I give them to them.

1421
01:26:46,162 --> 01:26:46,923
[SPEAKER_23]: They're intimidating.

1422
01:26:47,424 --> 01:26:48,725
[SPEAKER_23]: Anything else you want to say to our listeners this evening?

1423
01:26:49,285 --> 01:26:49,706
[SPEAKER_27]: Bye, guys.

1424
01:26:51,927 --> 01:26:52,408
[SPEAKER_21]: Says it all.

1425
01:26:53,968 --> 01:26:59,971
[SPEAKER_27]: All right, we are back with somebody who was on the show a couple weeks ago when we were at his tournament, but now he's here at the Milpitas tournament.

1426
01:27:00,232 --> 01:27:01,172
[SPEAKER_27]: Introduce yourselves to the listeners.

1427
01:27:01,832 --> 01:27:02,253
[SPEAKER_27]: Hi, guys.

1428
01:27:02,293 --> 01:27:03,013
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm DCB.

1429
01:27:03,833 --> 01:27:04,654
[SPEAKER_27]: Hi, DCB.

1430
01:27:04,674 --> 01:27:05,735
[SPEAKER_27]: What brings you to Milpitas today?

1431
01:27:06,555 --> 01:27:07,375
[SPEAKER_27]: One word.

1432
01:27:08,016 --> 01:27:08,936
[SPEAKER_27]: Shades.

1433
01:27:09,557 --> 01:27:11,418
[SPEAKER_27]: That's another interview I've got to get later if I can.

1434
01:27:13,119 --> 01:27:13,299
[SPEAKER_27]: So...

1435
01:27:14,684 --> 01:27:15,865
[SPEAKER_21]: What kinds of stuff are you doing here today?

1436
01:27:15,885 --> 01:27:17,366
[SPEAKER_21]: Are you participating in PA?

1437
01:27:18,166 --> 01:27:20,467
[SPEAKER_21]: I was one of the three people that didn't qualify for PA.

1438
01:27:20,988 --> 01:27:21,268
[SPEAKER_21]: Dope!

1439
01:27:21,468 --> 01:27:23,509
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, I'm that leet.

1440
01:27:23,629 --> 01:27:24,610
[SPEAKER_21]: You're in a special club?

1441
01:27:24,910 --> 01:27:26,751
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, there's like three of us, so that's cool.

1442
01:27:27,471 --> 01:27:28,432
[SPEAKER_27]: Did you come in dead last?

1443
01:27:29,052 --> 01:27:30,193
[SPEAKER_21]: Nah, I don't know.

1444
01:27:30,253 --> 01:27:30,693
[SPEAKER_21]: Ask Milton.

1445
01:27:31,654 --> 01:27:32,474
[SPEAKER_27]: Well, that's something.

1446
01:27:32,494 --> 01:27:33,695
[SPEAKER_27]: At least you didn't come in last.

1447
01:27:34,035 --> 01:27:36,116
[SPEAKER_27]: Or if you did, hey, last place or something.

1448
01:27:37,057 --> 01:27:38,437
[SPEAKER_27]: So I hear you got a joke for the listeners.

1449
01:27:39,118 --> 01:27:39,698
[SPEAKER_27]: Knock, knock.

1450
01:27:40,138 --> 01:27:40,979
[SPEAKER_21]: Who's there?

1451
01:27:41,039 --> 01:27:41,499
[SPEAKER_21]: Bob.

1452
01:27:41,739 --> 01:27:42,320
[SPEAKER_21]: Bob who?

1453
01:27:42,340 --> 01:27:43,000
[SPEAKER_21]: Bob Saget.

1454
01:27:43,020 --> 01:27:43,060
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh!

1455
01:27:46,217 --> 01:27:46,457
[SPEAKER_21]: Ha.

1456
01:27:47,598 --> 01:27:48,339
[SPEAKER_21]: Dot, dot, dot.

1457
01:27:48,379 --> 01:27:48,819
[SPEAKER_21]: Ha, ha.

1458
01:27:49,820 --> 01:27:52,882
[SPEAKER_21]: I think if you were on Star Search, they would have given you one star, but that's all right.

1459
01:27:53,363 --> 01:27:56,005
[SPEAKER_21]: I'd rather be on American Idol, because Simon is sexy.

1460
01:27:56,566 --> 01:27:58,187
[SPEAKER_21]: You want to audition for American Idol right now?

1461
01:27:58,207 --> 01:27:59,368
[SPEAKER_21]: You want to sing us something?

1462
01:27:59,388 --> 01:27:59,428
[SPEAKER_21]: No.

1463
01:27:59,448 --> 01:28:00,089
[SPEAKER_21]: Sing us something from DDR.

1464
01:28:00,109 --> 01:28:01,570
[SPEAKER_03]: Come on, Cartoon Heroes.

1465
01:28:02,451 --> 01:28:04,292
[SPEAKER_27]: We are the Killer Pals.

1466
01:28:04,332 --> 01:28:05,013
[SPEAKER_27]: Hi, guys.

1467
01:28:06,334 --> 01:28:07,435
[SPEAKER_27]: Explain to our listeners.

1468
01:28:07,455 --> 01:28:08,596
[SPEAKER_27]: I don't think we talked about this in Fremont.

1469
01:28:08,616 --> 01:28:09,737
[SPEAKER_27]: Tell us about the Killer Pals.

1470
01:28:09,757 --> 01:28:10,978
[SPEAKER_27]: What is the concept behind Killer Pals?

1471
01:28:11,818 --> 01:28:12,499
[SPEAKER_21]: and plug the website.

1472
01:28:12,759 --> 01:28:13,860
[SPEAKER_21]: We really don't know.

1473
01:28:13,961 --> 01:28:17,365
[SPEAKER_21]: It's just like all my friends and we call ourselves the Killer Pals.

1474
01:28:17,505 --> 01:28:18,145
[SPEAKER_21]: Do you kill people?

1475
01:28:18,506 --> 01:28:19,427
[SPEAKER_21]: No, we don't kill people.

1476
01:28:19,467 --> 01:28:26,535
[SPEAKER_21]: We're actually nice kids and we get good grades in school and we drink our milk every night.

1477
01:28:27,536 --> 01:28:30,640
[SPEAKER_27]: I was going to say, I noticed you changed from Kirk Cameron to Bob Saget.

1478
01:28:30,860 --> 01:28:31,521
[SPEAKER_27]: What brought this on?

1479
01:28:32,716 --> 01:28:34,097
[SPEAKER_21]: Kirk Cameron is just old.

1480
01:28:34,617 --> 01:28:35,978
[SPEAKER_21]: He didn't want to be my friend anymore.

1481
01:28:36,398 --> 01:28:37,819
[SPEAKER_21]: But Bob Saget, he's fresh.

1482
01:28:37,879 --> 01:28:38,759
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, he's cool.

1483
01:28:39,039 --> 01:28:39,579
[SPEAKER_22]: New ideas.

1484
01:28:39,819 --> 01:28:40,420
[SPEAKER_21]: New ideas.

1485
01:28:41,340 --> 01:28:43,041
[SPEAKER_27]: Dirty Works is one of my favorite movies of all time.

1486
01:28:43,541 --> 01:28:44,341
I like Full House.

1487
01:28:45,662 --> 01:28:47,923
[SPEAKER_27]: Hey, did you hear the Olsen twins are going to college soon?

1488
01:28:47,943 --> 01:28:49,644
[SPEAKER_13]: I did it.

1489
01:28:50,524 --> 01:28:51,425
[SPEAKER_27]: That one's for you, bro, too.

1490
01:28:51,665 --> 01:28:52,785
[SPEAKER_27]: Who's your favorite Olsen twin?

1491
01:28:53,906 --> 01:28:54,286
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah, anyway.

1492
01:28:54,666 --> 01:28:58,648
[SPEAKER_27]: Anything else you want to say for our listeners?

1493
01:29:00,303 --> 01:29:03,765
[SPEAKER_21]: I just did the shittiest routine ever in a DDR tournament.

1494
01:29:03,805 --> 01:29:05,426
[SPEAKER_09]: Can you say shittiest?

1495
01:29:05,486 --> 01:29:07,347
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes, you can say anything you want on the fucking internet.

1496
01:29:08,307 --> 01:29:09,508
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, it sucked real bad.

1497
01:29:09,528 --> 01:29:10,309
[SPEAKER_21]: I didn't know what I was doing.

1498
01:29:10,349 --> 01:29:13,711
[SPEAKER_21]: I tried popping and locking all those cool kids, but I'm too white to do it.

1499
01:29:14,471 --> 01:29:19,994
[SPEAKER_21]: And then all the other killer pals got behind the machine and started making designs with their arms.

1500
01:29:20,535 --> 01:29:22,596
[SPEAKER_21]: And I don't know, I was just trying not to fail the stupid song.

1501
01:29:22,616 --> 01:29:23,717
[SPEAKER_21]: Were you leading everybody in the wave?

1502
01:29:24,457 --> 01:29:25,378
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't know what I was doing.

1503
01:29:25,538 --> 01:29:26,178
[SPEAKER_27]: What song did you get?

1504
01:29:26,638 --> 01:29:27,439
[SPEAKER_21]: Secret Rendezvous.

1505
01:29:28,882 --> 01:29:29,462
[SPEAKER_27]: Secret Lovers.

1506
01:29:30,562 --> 01:29:31,943
[SPEAKER_27]: Oh, is that the concept behind Killer Pals?

1507
01:29:31,963 --> 01:29:32,443
[SPEAKER_27]: No, I'm just kidding.

1508
01:29:33,063 --> 01:29:34,263
[SPEAKER_21]: That's between me and Bob Saget.

1509
01:29:36,043 --> 01:29:39,664
[SPEAKER_27]: Well, you know what they say about Bob Saget.

1510
01:29:39,804 --> 01:29:40,124
[SPEAKER_27]: All right.

1511
01:29:40,304 --> 01:29:41,685
[SPEAKER_27]: Any final words for listeners?

1512
01:29:42,065 --> 01:29:42,665
[SPEAKER_27]: Bye, guys.

1513
01:29:43,345 --> 01:29:43,865
[SPEAKER_27]: How did I know?

1514
01:29:44,645 --> 01:29:44,925
[SPEAKER_27]: All right.

1515
01:29:45,005 --> 01:29:47,666
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm just going to move right over here to somebody who has been piping in.

1516
01:29:47,966 --> 01:29:49,146
[SPEAKER_27]: Because he always has something to say.

1517
01:29:49,226 --> 01:29:49,666
[SPEAKER_27]: Say hello.

1518
01:29:49,826 --> 01:29:52,307
[SPEAKER_27]: This is, what, the fourth or fifth time you've been on the show?

1519
01:29:53,067 --> 01:29:54,167
[SPEAKER_27]: Let's see.

1523
01:30:13,275 --> 01:30:22,900
[SPEAKER_27]: Yes, I have 20 heavy AAAs in two weeks, you're almost a Yasu level there, no, no, I'm scared of Yasu, what would you do if you showed up at Cyber Beat Nation?

1524
01:30:23,461 --> 01:30:24,141
[SPEAKER_27]: I wouldn't enter, what?

1525
01:30:27,438 --> 01:30:28,079
[SPEAKER_18]: Bye, guys!

1526
01:30:28,399 --> 01:30:28,979

[SPEAKER_27]: I have a Fakuk shirt, too.

1533
01:30:35,141 --> 01:30:36,161
[SPEAKER_27]: It's one of my favorite clothing brands.

1534
01:30:36,181 --> 01:30:36,921
[SPEAKER_18]: Everybody loves Fakuk.

1535
01:30:37,301 --> 01:30:38,362
[SPEAKER_27]: Everybody loves to Fakuk.

1536
01:30:38,862 --> 01:30:41,943

[SPEAKER_27]: Well, bye!

[SPEAKER_27]: Hey, back to Virtue.

[SPEAKER_27]: Before I was so rudely interrupted... Calm down, buddy.

1540
01:30:50,505 --> 01:30:53,426
[SPEAKER_27]: Well, we were like, oh my god, a chick that plays DDR, so, you know, we had to...

1541
01:30:54,252 --> 01:30:54,792
[SPEAKER_27]: We had to break.

1542
01:30:55,473 --> 01:30:56,114
[SPEAKER_27]: News bulletin.

1543
01:30:56,934 --> 01:31:00,077
[SPEAKER_27]: Of course, we've got DarkSakura in the studio right now.

1544
01:31:00,117 --> 01:31:01,258
[SPEAKER_27]: I know Chick plays DDR, but, you know.

1545
01:31:03,019 --> 01:31:04,460
[SPEAKER_27]: So, yes, do you have questions for me?

1546
01:31:04,760 --> 01:31:05,701
[SPEAKER_27]: Do I have questions for you?

1547
01:31:05,741 --> 01:31:06,782
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah, what the hell are you doing here today?

1548

01:31:08,744 --> 01:31:09,544
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm losing to Tigger.

1551
01:31:10,485 --> 01:31:11,726
[SPEAKER_27]: As Perfect Attack's over, you lost to Tigger?

1552
01:31:11,806 --> 01:31:12,186
[SPEAKER_27]: Final round?

1553
01:31:12,407 --> 01:31:12,707
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah.

1554
01:31:13,267 --> 01:31:13,668
[SPEAKER_27]: What was it?

1555
01:31:13,708 --> 01:31:14,368
[SPEAKER_27]: What'd you have to fight him on?

1556
01:31:14,608 --> 01:31:15,289
[SPEAKER_27]: Perfect Attack.

1557
01:31:15,789 --> 01:31:16,450
[SPEAKER_27]: Fucking holic.

01:31:19,732 --> 01:31:20,613
[SPEAKER_27]: How bad did he beat you?

1561

[SPEAKER_27]: 93 Marvelous?

1562
01:31:21,674 --> 01:31:21,774
[SPEAKER_27]: Nope.

1563
01:31:26,454 --> 01:31:28,375
[SPEAKER_27]: So you're not going to be doing a freestyle today?

1564
01:31:28,875 --> 01:31:30,456
[SPEAKER_27]: I did my freestyle with the Killer Pals.

1565
01:31:30,796 --> 01:31:31,657
[SPEAKER_27]: I made the design.

1566
01:31:32,117 --> 01:31:32,477
[SPEAKER_27]: Oh, okay.

1567
01:31:32,497 --> 01:31:33,218
[SPEAKER_27]: What was the design?

1568
01:31:33,318 --> 01:31:34,558
[SPEAKER_27]: What design were you a part of?

1569
01:31:34,918 --> 01:31:35,539
[SPEAKER_27]: I was the arm.

1570
01:31:38,420 --> 01:31:38,861
[SPEAKER_27]: Okay.

1571
01:31:39,401 --> 01:31:43,083
[SPEAKER_27]: So any other... You know that Buddha thing that has all the weird arms and like 50 legs?

1572
01:31:43,583 --> 01:31:44,704
[SPEAKER_27]: We made that behind the machine.

1573
01:31:44,984 --> 01:31:46,125
[SPEAKER_13]: And the machine was the body.

1574
01:31:48,639 --> 01:31:49,559
[SPEAKER_04]: Very interesting.

1575
01:31:49,699 --> 01:31:57,522
[SPEAKER_04]: I just had a picture of like all the fobs in the crowd, just like on their hands and knees worshipping Buddha, but they didn't realize it was a DDR machine.

1576
01:31:58,643 --> 01:32:01,004
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's now BBR, Buddha Buddha Revolution.

1577
01:32:02,664 --> 01:32:03,385
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you rub its belly?

1578
01:32:04,485 --> 01:32:05,185
[SPEAKER_05]: I fucked its belly.

1579
01:32:05,706 --> 01:32:06,586
[SPEAKER_05]: Side note, he's going to hell.

1580
01:32:07,626 --> 01:32:08,127
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you going to hell?

1581
01:32:08,547 --> 01:32:09,847
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not Philippine, I mean Viet like you.

1582
01:32:09,867 --> 01:32:12,168
[SPEAKER_05]: We're all going to hell for laughing.

1583
01:32:12,548 --> 01:32:13,168
[SPEAKER_20]: Bye guys!

01:32:13,189 --> 01:32:14,109
[SPEAKER_20]: Bye guys!

[SPEAKER_04]: www.bmoneystyle.com, as always, the7.net for my web space, which is almost gone, Killer Pals, I don't know the website because it's too damn long, maple.org, because he has the best blog in the world because he doesn't do anything on it, coryinamerica.com, soon to come, because I triple A'd tears,

1588
01:32:44,895 --> 01:32:47,476
[SPEAKER_03]: and B-11 on my second try, which is also my first 9-footer.

1589
01:32:47,696 --> 01:32:48,876
[SPEAKER_27]: Did you send those pictures to Aaron?

1590
01:32:49,376 --> 01:32:52,597
[SPEAKER_27]: Aaron wouldn't take my B-11 because it wasn't the result screen, fucking cock.

1591
01:32:54,038 --> 01:32:57,139
[SPEAKER_27]: The views and opinions dispersed on Orange Line.

1592
01:32:57,259 --> 01:33:01,320
[SPEAKER_27]: I... You can address those cards and letters to Virtu, care of the Max 300 King's Palace.

1596
01:33:14,264 --> 01:33:14,504
[SPEAKER_04]: Since...

1597
01:33:15,203 --> 01:33:15,963
[SPEAKER_04]: Extreme came out.

1598
01:33:15,983 --> 01:33:28,028
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been there every day practicing for Cyber Beat Nation because I want the fucking controller and I need $400 so I can go to fucking Magic 5 up in Seattle and then go to Midwest Showdown 5 over in Michigan.

1599
01:33:28,228 --> 01:33:29,369
[SPEAKER_12]: You're a silly DDR kid.

1600
01:33:29,689 --> 01:33:30,849
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, you can suck my cock.

1601
01:33:31,930 --> 01:33:32,270
[SPEAKER_12]: He is.

1602
01:33:33,831 --> 01:33:35,031
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, I got a bigger cock than you.

1603
01:33:36,692 --> 01:33:40,773
[SPEAKER_05]: And on that note, any final... I'm not going to respond to that because we all know that I have the bigger one.

1604
01:33:42,334 --> 01:33:42,994
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, Milton?

1605
01:33:43,815 --> 01:33:43,955
[SPEAKER_27]: I'll...

1606
01:33:46,419 --> 01:33:49,580
[SPEAKER_27]: to be settled on a future episode any final thoughts for the listeners?

1607
01:33:49,780 --> 01:34:07,730
[SPEAKER_27]: write down the chat where everyone's going dot dot dot dot dot dot dot dot dot dot dot dot dot oh my god, the imagery, the imagery alright, right now I'm picturing fucking Twin saying like, what the fuck and then there's fucking I'm gonna beep that name out because we don't talk about that you're gonna beep Twin out?

1608
01:34:07,970 --> 01:34:09,611
[SPEAKER_27]: yeah, we're gonna beep that name out what?

1609
01:34:11,812 --> 01:34:13,133
[SPEAKER_03]: you can't talk about retards on your show?

1610
01:34:13,971 --> 01:34:15,452
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, okay, I guess we can make a decision.

1611
01:34:15,593 --> 01:34:16,453
[SPEAKER_03]: Just because you're Vertu.

1612
01:34:17,134 --> 01:34:17,795
[SPEAKER_27]: Yes, Jamie?

1613
01:34:18,515 --> 01:34:20,877
[SPEAKER_19]: By the way, I encourage leaving that intact.

1614
01:34:21,218 --> 01:34:24,781
[SPEAKER_27]: Yes, so thanks to Jamie, we didn't beep it.

1615
01:34:25,161 --> 01:34:26,703
[SPEAKER_27]: Jamie convinced me that we shouldn't beep it.

1616
01:34:26,723 --> 01:34:27,744
[SPEAKER_27]: You're welcome, Corey.

1617
01:34:27,924 --> 01:34:28,284
[SPEAKER_27]: Here we go.

1618
01:34:29,205 --> 01:34:29,745
[SPEAKER_27]: Moving right along.

1619
01:34:29,765 --> 01:34:33,108
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm going to be honest with you, your channel is almost as bad as DDR Maniac.

1620
01:34:35,671 --> 01:34:36,091
[SPEAKER_27]: Why is that?

1621
01:34:36,451 --> 01:34:38,253
[SPEAKER_27]: Because it's filled with twin.

1622
01:34:38,954 --> 01:34:40,235
[SPEAKER_27]: Not anymore, we banned his ass like a month ago.

1623
01:34:41,423 --> 01:34:43,965
[SPEAKER_27]: That's how long I've been gone because Twin's been.

1624
01:34:45,866 --> 01:34:46,867
[SPEAKER_04]: Jesus Christ.

1625
01:34:47,788 --> 01:34:49,149
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello, welcome to 5 Minutes Ago.

1626
01:34:49,829 --> 01:34:50,630
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, any final thoughts?

1627
01:34:51,890 --> 01:34:52,931
[SPEAKER_04]: See you guys at CeraVeat Nation.

1628
01:34:52,951 --> 01:34:54,833
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm expecting another interview at CeraVeat Nation.

1629
01:34:55,793 --> 01:34:56,274
[SPEAKER_26]: We'll see.

1630
01:34:56,614 --> 01:34:56,974
[SPEAKER_27]: We'll see.

1631
01:34:57,594 --> 01:34:59,656
[SPEAKER_27]: How much if I bribe you will I get an interview?

1632
01:35:00,617 --> 01:35:02,318
[SPEAKER_27]: Maybe if I get to play that controller that you win.

1633
01:35:03,178 --> 01:35:04,659
[SPEAKER_21]: We're just listening to Virtue.

1634
01:35:04,679 --> 01:35:05,860
[SPEAKER_21]: We want to hear some Kyle Snyder.

1635
01:35:05,880 --> 01:35:06,641
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it's all about me.

1636
01:35:06,661 --> 01:35:08,102
[SPEAKER_27]: I mean Snyder.

1637
01:35:09,272 --> 01:35:11,374
[SPEAKER_27]: Why don't we interview this fellow over here?

1638
01:35:11,995 --> 01:35:15,879
[SPEAKER_27]: Actually, before we interview that fellow over there, Jamie wanted to read something for all you folks.

1639
01:35:17,061 --> 01:35:21,626
[SPEAKER_19]: This is an email sent by Twin bragging about all the channels he's been banned from.

1640
01:35:22,717 --> 01:35:29,146
[SPEAKER_26]: Actually, this was an email sent by Twen because I told him to fuck off for trying to start shit last week.

1641
01:35:29,626 --> 01:35:35,354
[SPEAKER_18]: And the dumbass, he emailed me back and was like, Oh, please, please, please, can you send me the arcade disc for DDR Extreme?

1642
01:35:35,594 --> 01:35:37,316
[SPEAKER_26]: Like, I'm going to say, Oh, okay.

1643
01:35:37,576 --> 01:35:38,438
[SPEAKER_26]: I'll just totally forget that.

1644
01:35:38,658 --> 01:35:39,319
[SPEAKER_26]: But instead, he's like,

1645
01:35:39,899 --> 01:35:43,680
[SPEAKER_26]: Hey Loki, this is the only other way I know how to get in contact with you.

1646
01:35:43,700 --> 01:35:45,780
[SPEAKER_26]: He sent me an email through my website because there's a form.

1647
01:35:46,520 --> 01:35:52,441
[SPEAKER_26]: Since I'm banned from DDR Mania X, It Music, Bomani Style, DDR UK, and Orange Lounge.

1648
01:35:53,261 --> 01:35:54,422
[SPEAKER_26]: Congratulations!

1649
01:35:55,722 --> 01:35:57,082
[SPEAKER_19]: Congratulations, you suck.

1650
01:35:59,002 --> 01:36:00,743
[SPEAKER_27]: Alright, moving right along with the interviews.

1651
01:36:00,983 --> 01:36:01,823
[SPEAKER_27]: Let's interview this fellow.

1652
01:36:02,943 --> 01:36:04,943
[SPEAKER_27]: I'll be right back.

1653
01:36:04,963 --> 01:36:05,363
[SPEAKER_27]: BRB.

1654
01:36:05,744 --> 01:36:06,004
[SPEAKER_27]: Okay.

1655
01:36:07,404 --> 01:36:08,284
[SPEAKER_27]: Okay, in the meantime...

1656
01:36:09,252 --> 01:36:09,892
[SPEAKER_27]: How are you, gentlemen?

1657
01:36:12,173 --> 01:36:13,333
[SPEAKER_27]: Okay.

1658
01:36:14,334 --> 01:36:15,454
[SPEAKER_27]: Introduce yourself for our listeners.

1659
01:36:15,474 --> 01:36:16,554
[SPEAKER_27]: You don't even know what the hell you're getting into.

1660
01:36:16,574 --> 01:36:19,655
[SPEAKER_27]: This part sucks because this guy didn't want to be interviewed, so just bear with us.

1661
01:36:21,496 --> 01:36:22,777
[SPEAKER_27]: You don't have anything you want to say?

1662
01:36:24,197 --> 01:36:24,397
[SPEAKER_27]: No.

1663
01:36:25,157 --> 01:36:25,457
[SPEAKER_27]: All right.

1664
01:36:26,058 --> 01:36:26,398
[SPEAKER_27]: I cry.

1665
01:36:26,838 --> 01:36:29,059
[SPEAKER_27]: All right, we'll be... That's what I wanted to say.

1666
01:36:29,079 --> 01:36:29,599
[SPEAKER_27]: Hi, guys.

1667
01:36:29,699 --> 01:36:32,980
[SPEAKER_27]: All right, we'll come back whenever Virtue gets back here with his surprise.

1668
01:36:34,983 --> 01:36:35,604
[SPEAKER_27]: Wait, you have an idea?

1669
01:36:35,824 --> 01:36:36,364
[SPEAKER_27]: We're still rolling.

1670
01:36:36,424 --> 01:36:38,426
[SPEAKER_27]: Oh, okay.

1671
01:36:38,746 --> 01:36:39,047
[SPEAKER_27]: You know what?

1672
01:36:39,107 --> 01:36:40,328
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm just going to let Virtue do this interview.

1673
01:36:42,189 --> 01:36:43,450
[SPEAKER_27]: Why, thank you.

1674
01:36:43,550 --> 01:36:44,051
[SPEAKER_27]: You're welcome.

1675
01:36:44,371 --> 01:36:45,312
[SPEAKER_05]: Would you like to hold my stuff?

1676
01:36:45,332 --> 01:36:46,113
[SPEAKER_27]: Yes, I will hold your stuff.

1677
01:36:46,273 --> 01:36:47,874
[SPEAKER_05]: It gleams with sex.

1678
01:36:47,894 --> 01:36:49,295
[SPEAKER_27]: You have Melody's camera.

1679
01:36:49,676 --> 01:36:50,476
[SPEAKER_05]: I have my camera.

1680
01:36:50,837 --> 01:36:51,577
[SPEAKER_05]: I had it before me.

1681
01:36:52,098 --> 01:36:53,359
[SPEAKER_05]: I had it before her.

1682
01:36:53,839 --> 01:36:54,900
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, so what's your name?

1683
01:36:55,401 --> 01:36:55,621
[SPEAKER_13]: Alex.

1684
01:36:56,602 --> 01:36:58,944
[SPEAKER_08]: Alex, what's your... Mr. Cool.

1685
01:37:00,065 --> 01:37:00,745
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. Cool.

1686
01:37:01,025 --> 01:37:01,626
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. Cool.

1687
01:37:02,086 --> 01:37:02,747
[SPEAKER_03]: And what's it supposed to mean?

1688
01:37:04,299 --> 01:37:04,859
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, I got it.

1689
01:37:05,079 --> 01:37:05,660
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a nickname.

1690
01:37:06,741 --> 01:37:09,323
[SPEAKER_08]: During class one day, we were talking about rappers.

1691
01:37:10,003 --> 01:37:11,305
[SPEAKER_08]: I said something about mystical.

1692
01:37:11,485 --> 01:37:16,369
[SPEAKER_08]: One of my friends misunderstood me for Mr. Cool, so that's pretty much how I got the name.

1693
01:37:18,551 --> 01:37:21,253
[SPEAKER_27]: That's funny that happened in school, because, like, be cool, stay in school.

1694
01:37:21,994 --> 01:37:23,515
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah, yeah.

1695
01:37:23,835 --> 01:37:24,576
[SPEAKER_27]: Did you stay in school?

1696
01:37:25,917 --> 01:37:28,639
[SPEAKER_27]: I didn't stay in college, but, you know, I'm not a role model, so it's okay.

1697
01:37:28,659 --> 01:37:29,180
[SPEAKER_27]: You're not cool.

1698
01:37:30,365 --> 01:37:31,886
[SPEAKER_27]: I know.

1699
01:37:32,286 --> 01:37:33,166
[SPEAKER_27]: I drink and smoke crack.

1700
01:37:33,206 --> 01:37:34,527
[SPEAKER_27]: But anyway, I'm sorry, I'm not being interviewed.

1701
01:37:35,107 --> 01:37:36,267
[SPEAKER_04]: He oozes sex as well.

1702
01:37:37,928 --> 01:37:40,089
[SPEAKER_04]: So, what are you doing today at the tournament?

1703
01:37:40,109 --> 01:37:41,410
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you running PA, freestyle?

1704
01:37:41,430 --> 01:37:41,810
[SPEAKER_04]: Freestyle.

1705
01:37:42,070 --> 01:37:42,850
[SPEAKER_08]: Improv freestyle, yeah.

1706
01:37:42,910 --> 01:37:43,350
[SPEAKER_04]: Freestyle.

1707
01:37:43,770 --> 01:37:44,831
[SPEAKER_04]: What's the motive you're going with?

1708
01:37:45,311 --> 01:37:45,591
[SPEAKER_04]: Mode?

1709
01:37:46,111 --> 01:37:46,352
[SPEAKER_12]: Motive.

1710
01:37:47,272 --> 01:37:47,752
[SPEAKER_08]: Any theme?

1711
01:37:48,392 --> 01:37:49,753
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I'm just... No.

1712
01:37:50,973 --> 01:37:52,934
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just hoping I have a fast sign, just like do whatever.

1713
01:37:53,234 --> 01:37:56,396
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you plan to do hand drops and hand plants and knee drops?

1714
01:37:57,076 --> 01:37:57,256
No.

1715
01:37:58,917 --> 01:37:59,297
[SPEAKER_08]: What was that?

1716
01:37:59,677 --> 01:37:59,797
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

1717
01:38:00,714 --> 01:38:01,815
[SPEAKER_08]: Are you praying for Dynamite Rave?

1718
01:38:02,955 --> 01:38:03,516
[SPEAKER_08]: Definitely.

1719
01:38:03,616 --> 01:38:05,957
[SPEAKER_08]: As long as I get that song, if not, I'll argue.

1720
01:38:06,678 --> 01:38:07,939
[SPEAKER_08]: Can we see a bar hop in your routine?

1721
01:38:09,119 --> 01:38:09,260
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

1722
01:38:10,400 --> 01:38:11,301
[SPEAKER_08]: No, we can't see any bar hops?

1723
01:38:11,881 --> 01:38:13,582
[SPEAKER_08]: I think I'll get disqualified.

1724
01:38:14,963 --> 01:38:15,684
[SPEAKER_08]: The bar is your friend.

1725
01:38:16,024 --> 01:38:16,564
[SPEAKER_08]: I know.

1726
01:38:17,185 --> 01:38:17,985
[SPEAKER_08]: I like the bar.

1727
01:38:21,167 --> 01:38:21,828
[SPEAKER_08]: Jump over the bar.

1728
01:38:21,848 --> 01:38:24,189
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you have any final words for the listeners?

1729
01:38:25,430 --> 01:38:25,610
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

1730
01:38:26,531 --> 01:38:27,491
[SPEAKER_27]: Okay, that's you.

1731
01:38:27,531 --> 01:38:28,072
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm better than you.

1732
01:38:28,112 --> 01:38:28,452
[SPEAKER_27]: Peace out.

1733
01:38:31,158 --> 01:38:34,279
[SPEAKER_27]: Hey, alright, the tournament's over now, but I got one more interview tonight.

1734
01:38:34,599 --> 01:38:35,859
[SPEAKER_27]: Because I missed him at Fremont.

1735
01:38:36,139 --> 01:38:39,600
[SPEAKER_27]: I promised to interview this guy at Fremont, and I completely forgot because I'm an asshole.

1736
01:38:39,880 --> 01:38:41,161
[SPEAKER_27]: But, here he is.

1737
01:38:41,421 --> 01:38:42,661
[SPEAKER_27]: Introduce yourself for our listening audience.

1738
01:38:43,301 --> 01:38:47,662
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm Ben, aka Chubbs, and that's all I got to say about that.

1739
01:38:48,102 --> 01:38:48,762
[SPEAKER_04]: How you doing?

1740
01:38:49,183 --> 01:38:50,723
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm not bad, I guess.

1741
01:38:51,243 --> 01:38:53,124
[SPEAKER_27]: What brought you to the Milpitas tournament tonight?

1742
01:38:53,644 --> 01:38:58,565
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I was judging, so if I didn't come, I think Milton would be angry with me.

1743
01:39:00,077 --> 01:39:01,178
[SPEAKER_27]: Sounds pretty reasonable.

1744
01:39:01,298 --> 01:39:03,940
[SPEAKER_27]: So what kinds of things were you looking for tonight in the improv routines?

1745
01:39:04,340 --> 01:39:08,243
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, my specific category as a judge was looking for their charisma.

1746
01:39:08,904 --> 01:39:10,645
[SPEAKER_04]: So that was the only thing I was judging on.

1747
01:39:11,883 --> 01:39:18,909
[SPEAKER_27]: What were some of the good qualities that you saw tonight, the better charismatic things that you saw tonight?

1748
01:39:19,249 --> 01:39:26,115
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, Lil B was facing the crowd pretty much the whole time, and that was pretty good for Charisma, and he looked like he was having a pretty good time too.

1749
01:39:26,495 --> 01:39:30,098
[SPEAKER_04]: JC also, like those two in my book were pretty close.

1750
01:39:31,079 --> 01:39:32,260
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are probably the only good ones.

1751
01:39:32,280 --> 01:39:35,123
[SPEAKER_27]: What do you think about judging improv versus judging routines?

1752
01:39:35,923 --> 01:39:42,610
[SPEAKER_04]: Judging routines is probably easier because there's not just one specific thing you judge.

1753
01:39:43,051 --> 01:39:44,692
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just judging the whole routine.

1754
01:39:46,074 --> 01:39:49,037
[SPEAKER_27]: At least when you see a bad one, it's not so painful when it's improv, right?

1755
01:39:49,717 --> 01:39:51,579
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, because they have an excuse.

1756
01:39:53,234 --> 01:39:53,614
[SPEAKER_27]: Right on.

1757
01:39:53,654 --> 01:39:56,455
[SPEAKER_27]: So what other kinds of events are you going to be attending in the near future?

1758
01:39:56,535 --> 01:39:57,875
[SPEAKER_27]: Anything you want to plug, or I don't know?

1759
01:39:58,095 --> 01:39:58,995
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1760
01:39:59,395 --> 01:40:02,136
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just going to go to pretty much every tournament in the future.

1761
01:40:02,276 --> 01:40:06,037
[SPEAKER_04]: Back to basic, CBN, and I don't know what's after that.

1762
01:40:06,437 --> 01:40:07,177
[SPEAKER_27]: How'd you do in Perfect Attack?

1763
01:40:07,197 --> 01:40:08,138
[SPEAKER_27]: Did you do Perfect Attack today?

1764
01:40:08,318 --> 01:40:10,038
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I got third.

1765
01:40:10,058 --> 01:40:11,518
[SPEAKER_04]: Not too shabby.

1766
01:40:11,858 --> 01:40:12,319
[SPEAKER_04]: Kind of.

1767
01:40:13,219 --> 01:40:19,740
[SPEAKER_04]: See, Milton fucked up, and he forgot to have the third place match between me and Chaos.

1768
01:40:19,760 --> 01:40:20,040
[SPEAKER_04]: Nope.

1769
01:40:20,760 --> 01:40:22,401
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah, we're splitting third.

1770
01:40:23,453 --> 01:40:23,854
[SPEAKER_27]: That's all good.

1771
01:40:23,874 --> 01:40:24,194
[SPEAKER_27]: It works.

1772
01:40:24,815 --> 01:40:28,020
[SPEAKER_27]: So, any other final thoughts you have for the folks out there listening?

1773
01:40:30,744 --> 01:40:30,964
[SPEAKER_27]: No.

1774
01:40:32,546 --> 01:40:33,287
[SPEAKER_27]: Alright, that works.

1775
01:40:33,928 --> 01:40:36,251
[SPEAKER_27]: I think we're all tired as hell and it's time to go home.

1776
01:40:36,351 --> 01:40:37,894
[SPEAKER_27]: So, that's it.

1777
01:40:38,453 --> 01:40:40,414
[SPEAKER_27]: Milpitas Golf Land, we're out, bye

1778
01:41:11,286 --> 01:41:13,828
[SPEAKER_27]: Don't forget, Lovefist are in town right now.

1779
01:41:13,848 --> 01:41:14,148
[SPEAKER_27]: What's that?

1780
01:41:14,168 --> 01:41:15,129
[SPEAKER_27]: Lovefist is in town.

1781
01:41:15,369 --> 01:41:15,810
[SPEAKER_27]: Whatever.

1782
01:41:16,150 --> 01:41:19,633
[SPEAKER_27]: I flunk school because I'm hardcore.

1783
01:41:20,193 --> 01:41:20,554
[SPEAKER_27]: What?

1784
01:41:20,694 --> 01:41:22,495
[SPEAKER_27]: I've never even said that shit in my life.

1785
01:41:22,575 --> 01:41:25,157
[SPEAKER_27]: What is... Is it from Vice City?

1786
01:41:25,678 --> 01:41:27,559
[SPEAKER_27]: And that guy supposedly sounds like me or something?

1787
01:41:28,540 --> 01:41:31,502
[SPEAKER_27]: Somebody was telling me the other day that I sound like some guy in Vice City.

1788
01:41:32,823 --> 01:41:33,664
[SPEAKER_19]: Rob's famous.

1789
01:41:33,784 --> 01:41:34,425
[SPEAKER_27]: That's scary.

1790
01:41:34,525 --> 01:41:35,145
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm famous.

1791
01:41:35,225 --> 01:41:35,586
[SPEAKER_19]: Infamous.

1792
01:41:35,746 --> 01:41:36,967
[SPEAKER_27]: That is me, dammit!

1793
01:41:37,952 --> 01:41:38,493
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah, right.

1794
01:41:38,533 --> 01:41:38,754
[SPEAKER_27]: Anyway.

1795
01:41:39,035 --> 01:41:39,396
[SPEAKER_27]: Okay, yes.

1796
01:41:39,416 --> 01:41:39,997
[SPEAKER_27]: We're going to take a break.

1797
01:41:40,017 --> 01:41:41,341
[SPEAKER_27]: When we come back, we're going to do a list list.

1798
01:41:41,361 --> 01:41:43,286
[SPEAKER_27]: And that means you all get to participate.

1799
01:41:43,687 --> 01:41:44,449
[SPEAKER_27]: And you're going to vote.

1800
01:41:45,097 --> 01:41:46,437
[SPEAKER_27]: So here's a hint, you guys.

1801
01:41:47,418 --> 01:41:50,799
[SPEAKER_27]: During the break, you're going to get a big hint as to what our listless topic is tonight.

1802
01:41:51,259 --> 01:41:51,699
[SPEAKER_27]: Enjoy.

1803
01:41:52,239 --> 01:41:56,361
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm supposed to say hi to Strong Brad and apologizing for not interviewing him at Miggle.

1804
01:41:56,681 --> 01:41:57,421
[SPEAKER_27]: We'll get him next time.

1805
01:41:57,961 --> 01:42:02,182
[SPEAKER_27]: The next interviews, by the way, will be at Cyber Beat Nation in a couple weeks.

1806
01:42:02,322 --> 01:42:08,044
[SPEAKER_27]: There might even be a whole separate special out of that, like a different aired tape thing.

1807
01:42:08,084 --> 01:42:08,824
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm not sure yet.

1808
01:42:08,904 --> 01:42:10,185
[SPEAKER_27]: We have to talk about that, all the hosts.

1809
01:42:10,885 --> 01:42:13,586
[SPEAKER_27]: Anyway, I do not sound like Cookie from You Don't Know Jack.

1810
01:42:13,626 --> 01:42:13,946
[SPEAKER_27]: Fuck off.

1811
01:42:15,908 --> 01:42:16,208
[SPEAKER_27]: Shut up!

1812
01:42:16,329 --> 01:42:17,109
[SPEAKER_27]: All of you, shut up!

1813
01:42:18,050 --> 01:42:18,751
[SPEAKER_27]: Alright, we'll be back.

1814
01:42:18,771 --> 01:42:21,614
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, do it all night.

1815
01:42:21,855 --> 01:42:23,096
[SPEAKER_16]: Do it with me.

1816
01:42:23,556 --> 01:42:26,820
[SPEAKER_16]: I'll take you to heaven if you make me feel free, babe.

1817
01:42:26,860 --> 01:42:28,281
[SPEAKER_16]: Do it tonight.

1818
01:42:28,542 --> 01:42:29,963
[SPEAKER_16]: Do it alright.

1819
01:42:30,184 --> 01:42:33,087
[SPEAKER_16]: Just take me and shake me till I burn up inside.

1820
01:42:55,889 --> 01:42:56,711
Thank you for watching!

1821
01:43:45,100 --> 01:43:49,005
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you for watching!

1822
01:44:42,367 --> 01:44:43,614
Thank you for watching!

1823
01:45:29,281 --> 01:45:34,802
[SPEAKER_01]: Easier to dance to than that freaking catch-up song, Orange Lounge Radio.

1824
01:45:36,162 --> 01:45:38,563
[SPEAKER_27]: Hello kids, welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio.

1825
01:45:39,063 --> 01:45:42,183
[SPEAKER_27]: I missed an FU that came in over email.

1826
01:45:42,203 --> 01:45:46,964
[SPEAKER_27]: What happened is I'd actually read it before the show and then forgot to get back to it when the show was going on.

1827
01:45:47,044 --> 01:45:48,545
[SPEAKER_27]: So fuck me for missing it.

1828
01:45:48,625 --> 01:45:50,165
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm sorry, sorry.

1829
01:45:50,245 --> 01:45:54,086
[SPEAKER_27]: And it's from DDR Angel, who's a huge supporter of this show, and I feel bad because I missed it.

1830
01:45:54,326 --> 01:45:55,266
[SPEAKER_27]: So let's get to her FU.

1831
01:45:55,286 --> 01:45:55,326
[SPEAKER_27]: FU!

1832
01:45:57,335 --> 01:46:04,658
[SPEAKER_27]: HerFU is, fuck you to my graveyard shift co-worker who didn't bother to call me once last night to tell me he was going to be late to begin with.

1833
01:46:04,778 --> 01:46:09,080
[SPEAKER_27]: Fuck you to parents for not understanding your children even though you think you do, you're not us, haha.

1834
01:46:09,380 --> 01:46:12,641
[SPEAKER_27]: And finally a nice fuck you to earthquakes that have been pestering us all day long.

1835
01:46:13,782 --> 01:46:16,823
[SPEAKER_27]: Alright, so, my bad, I missed that earlier in the show.

1836
01:46:17,623 --> 01:46:19,584
[SPEAKER_27]: Please accept my apology!

1837
01:46:20,604 --> 01:46:21,685
[SPEAKER_27]: Alright, um...

1838
01:46:23,596 --> 01:46:26,898
[SPEAKER_27]: And does anybody know the final results from MGL?

1839
01:46:26,958 --> 01:46:27,599
[SPEAKER_27]: Good question.

1840
01:46:28,219 --> 01:46:36,664
[SPEAKER_27]: First place in Perfect Attack was Tigger, second was Virtue, and third was Chubs and Chaos, I believe, tied.

1841
01:46:36,684 --> 01:46:37,605
[SPEAKER_27]: I hope I didn't fuck that up.

1842
01:46:40,120 --> 01:46:45,022
[SPEAKER_27]: Freestyle, Improv Freestyle, first was JC, I believe his name was.

1843
01:46:45,903 --> 01:46:49,164
[SPEAKER_27]: Second place was, oh, I can look it up on DDR Freak, that's a good idea.

1844
01:46:50,805 --> 01:46:56,768
[SPEAKER_27]: I know second place was Lil B, third place, third place was somebody else, I don't remember who third place was, let me look.

1845
01:46:57,949 --> 01:47:02,751
[SPEAKER_27]: I know Oki, Oki was in fourth, oh, I think, yes, yes, because Fuzzy Cat won money, he was excited he won money.

1846
01:47:02,791 --> 01:47:04,552
[SPEAKER_27]: Fuzzy Cat was third, you're right, thank you.

1847
01:47:06,013 --> 01:47:06,313
[SPEAKER_27]: Alright.

1848
01:47:09,062 --> 01:47:21,371
[SPEAKER_27]: Alright, thank you, you guys, uh, hey, and even, one of the judges is in the chat room, I'm so retarded, I didn't even think to ask, but she's, Jenny Bean does confirm that yes, hello by the way, Jenny, uh, JC, Lil B, and Fuzzy, one, two, and three, right there.

1849
01:47:22,272 --> 01:47:22,552
[SPEAKER_19]: Alright.

1850
01:47:22,572 --> 01:47:24,654
[SPEAKER_19]: Alright, now we get to our favorite part of the show.

1851
01:47:25,274 --> 01:47:26,415
[SPEAKER_27]: Uh, Angel also says fuck you to her head cold.

1852
01:47:26,435 --> 01:47:30,518
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, my second favorite part of the show, actually my favorite part of the show is the fuck you to the weak, but, our other favorite part of the show.

1853
01:47:30,879 --> 01:47:31,319
Yay!

1854
01:47:31,519 --> 01:47:35,282
[SPEAKER_27]: Yay, it's the listless, and tonight, the topic, it's the listless.

1855
01:47:35,883 --> 01:47:37,064
[SPEAKER_19]: You should do a theme song.

1856
01:47:37,304 --> 01:47:37,784
[SPEAKER_19]: No.

1857
01:47:37,824 --> 01:47:38,825
[SPEAKER_27]: Sing us a theme song.

1858
01:47:39,666 --> 01:47:41,448
[SPEAKER_27]: It's a listless shame.

1859
01:47:41,648 --> 01:47:42,509
[SPEAKER_27]: You're on a roll there.

1860
01:47:43,530 --> 01:47:50,657
[SPEAKER_26]: We'll get... We'll get... Everybody... That's what the fucking song is.

1861
01:47:51,618 --> 01:47:51,978
[SPEAKER_27]: You know what?

1862
01:47:52,639 --> 01:47:52,959
[SPEAKER_27]: You know what?

1863
01:47:52,979 --> 01:47:53,460
[SPEAKER_27]: We're gonna get...

1864
01:47:57,927 --> 01:47:59,067
[SPEAKER_27]: No, this is not dancer.

1865
01:47:59,147 --> 01:48:01,389
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm blowing out people's speakers.

1866
01:48:01,509 --> 01:48:01,829
[SPEAKER_27]: Okay.

1867
01:48:03,170 --> 01:48:03,710
[SPEAKER_27]: Oh, where were we?

[SPEAKER_27]: Tonight's list list.

1870
01:48:06,451 --> 01:48:10,113
[SPEAKER_27]: Title or song that erotic needs to do.

1871
01:48:10,333 --> 01:48:12,635
[SPEAKER_27]: A possible title for a new erotic song.

1872
01:48:12,815 --> 01:48:16,617
[SPEAKER_19]: This is actually coming from my fuck off show from Tuesday, was it?

1873
01:48:17,037 --> 01:48:19,659
[SPEAKER_19]: Where we were like coming up with erotic song titles in the chat room.

1874
01:48:20,519 --> 01:48:23,941
[SPEAKER_19]: Which I'm actually doing one of them on my list.

1875
01:48:24,935 --> 01:48:28,616
[SPEAKER_27]: Alright, so these are all songs that Erotic hasn't done, but they should.

1876
01:48:29,096 --> 01:48:33,078
[SPEAKER_27]: So, starting off, we've got, who's all participating in the room?

1877
01:48:33,118 --> 01:48:34,578
[SPEAKER_27]: Raise your hands so I make sure I don't miss everyone.

1878
01:48:35,218 --> 01:48:41,040
[SPEAKER_27]: One, two, three, four, five, six, okay, we've got six people participating, so we've got quite a few.

1879
01:48:41,080 --> 01:48:42,401
[SPEAKER_19]: Ryan is reading for Ryan.

1880
01:48:43,361 --> 01:48:44,981
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm reading for someone else, so these aren't mine.

1881
01:48:45,582 --> 01:48:48,263
[SPEAKER_27]: Alright, and then we have the other Ryan, we have Puppy Ryan.

1882
01:48:48,563 --> 01:48:50,203
[SPEAKER_27]: You're not, you aren't Ryan, you're Puppy.

[SPEAKER_19]: We were singing that to the tune of Love on the Phone.

1897
01:49:23,305 --> 01:49:23,845
[SPEAKER_27]: You're right, I was.

01:49:23,865 --> 01:49:27,267
[SPEAKER_23]: Alright, I have no idea which order this is in.

[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah, Erotic's never done anything with Naoki, but they could.

1947
01:51:50,799 --> 01:51:51,299
[SPEAKER_27]: But they could.

1948
01:51:51,639 --> 01:51:51,879
[SPEAKER_27]: Alright.

1949
01:51:52,660 --> 01:51:53,580
[SPEAKER_27]: Loki, you're number two pick.

1950
01:51:53,600 --> 01:51:55,360
[SPEAKER_26]: The question is, would she be talking about him?

1951
01:51:55,461 --> 01:51:56,801
[SPEAKER_26]: I mean, is he too old to suck?

1952
01:51:57,201 --> 01:51:57,581
[SPEAKER_26]: I don't know.

1953
01:51:57,921 --> 01:51:58,241

[SPEAKER_27]: DCB reminds me of a quote from yesterday, because I named one of my horses Politary.

01:52:19,699 --> 01:52:21,280
[SPEAKER_27]: Politary needs new bedding!

1959
01:52:22,021 --> 01:52:23,402

1986
01:53:38,430 --> 01:53:39,051
[SPEAKER_25]: Too shy, huh?

1987
01:53:40,272 --> 01:53:45,016
[SPEAKER_25]: Just hurry up and shoot it in my eyes so I can get paid for doing this damn porno flick and go home.

01:53:49,060 --> 01:53:50,021
[SPEAKER_13]: That was great.

1989

01:54:20,367 --> 01:54:22,047
[SPEAKER_27]: Could you sing a line from 100 Midget Gangbang?

1998
01:54:22,907 --> 01:54:25,167
[SPEAKER_27]: Would that be like the We Are the Lollipop Kids song?

1999
01:54:25,247 --> 01:54:25,488
[SPEAKER_27]: Oh, yes.

2000
01:54:26,148 --> 01:54:27,928
[SPEAKER_25]: Come into the temple of butt.

2001
01:54:31,573 --> 01:54:33,854

01:54:33,894 --> 01:54:35,135
[SPEAKER_25]: Alright, come on.

2003

01:56:04,151 --> 01:56:05,052
[SPEAKER_27]: I like that one.

2030
01:56:07,253 --> 01:56:09,954

[SPEAKER_27]: The elimination round.

2047
01:57:39,718 --> 01:57:42,359
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm going to remove Loose Like a Rubber Band.

2048
01:57:42,599 --> 01:57:44,459
[SPEAKER_19]: Loose Like a Rubber Band comes off the list.

2049
01:57:44,479 --> 01:57:45,960
[SPEAKER_19]: It's just not very exciting sounding.

2050
01:57:45,980 --> 01:57:46,300
[SPEAKER_27]: All right.

2051
01:57:47,945 --> 01:57:50,226
[SPEAKER_27]: Wait, wait, we gotta get Ryan.

2052
01:57:50,266 --> 01:57:52,886
[SPEAKER_27]: Even since the other Ryan's not in here, Ryan gets to pick one off the list.

2053
01:57:53,006 --> 01:57:55,887
[SPEAKER_23]: I'd say get rid of that shoot it in my eye one.

2054
01:57:55,927 --> 01:57:57,327
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah, that's a little long.

2055
01:57:57,928 --> 01:57:59,208
[SPEAKER_27]: Just hurry up and shoot it in my eye.

2056
01:57:59,228 --> 01:57:59,908
[SPEAKER_26]: It comes off the list.

2057
01:58:01,028 --> 01:58:03,509
[SPEAKER_26]: Sadly enough, I'm going to take off the last one of his.

2058
01:58:03,589 --> 01:58:06,570
[SPEAKER_26]: D2 old to suck cock.

2059
01:58:07,590 --> 01:58:08,350
[SPEAKER_27]: Poor Ryan.

2060
01:58:10,091 --> 01:58:12,671
[SPEAKER_26]: There's no age limit for sucking cock.

2061
01:58:14,052 --> 01:58:15,412
[SPEAKER_27]: Puppy, what's coming off the list?

2062
01:58:15,632 --> 01:58:22,476
[SPEAKER_24]: Well, first of all, I don't think anybody wants to think of Naoki sucking cock, okay?

2063
01:58:22,516 --> 01:58:25,118
[SPEAKER_19]: Remember, Naoki's flexible enough to suck his own cock.

2064
01:58:27,579 --> 01:58:29,320
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't want that image, okay?

2065
01:58:29,740 --> 01:58:33,062
[SPEAKER_27]: Anyway... Uh, let's see.

2066
01:58:33,703 --> 01:58:35,204
[SPEAKER_27]: I can't see the list, you're blocking me.

2067
01:58:35,264 --> 01:58:35,744
[SPEAKER_27]: Oh, I'm sorry.

2068
01:58:36,044 --> 01:58:36,665
[SPEAKER_27]: My bad, my bad.

2069
01:58:36,685 --> 01:58:37,005
[SPEAKER_27]: Here it is.

2070
01:58:37,845 --> 01:58:37,985
[SPEAKER_27]: Ah!

2071
01:58:38,426 --> 01:58:38,746
[SPEAKER_27]: There it is.

2072
01:58:39,106 --> 01:58:41,387
[SPEAKER_27]: Okay, um... Here are the passion gerbils.

2073
01:58:42,028 --> 01:58:42,968
[SPEAKER_27]: Passion gerbil!

2074
01:58:43,048 --> 01:58:43,749
[SPEAKER_27]: Aw, you suck!

2075
01:58:46,243 --> 01:58:47,483
[SPEAKER_27]: Jonas, what's coming off the list?

2076
01:58:49,504 --> 01:58:52,326
[SPEAKER_07]: I've got to say, Gimme Ian, I'll Make Out With Everyone.

2077
01:58:52,506 --> 01:58:54,186
[SPEAKER_27]: Gimme Ian, I'll Make Out With Everyone.

2078
01:58:55,956 --> 01:58:57,156
[SPEAKER_27]: All right, that comes off the list.

2079
01:58:57,797 --> 01:59:00,217
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm going to take off... Pants.

2080
01:59:01,998 --> 01:59:02,178
[SPEAKER_27]: No.

2081
01:59:02,738 --> 01:59:05,239
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm going to take off... The strap-on.

2082
01:59:06,439 --> 01:59:07,039
[SPEAKER_27]: This is kind of hard.

2083
01:59:07,079 --> 01:59:09,840
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm going to take off Crouching Cocker Hidden Pussy.

2084
01:59:10,220 --> 01:59:12,181
[SPEAKER_27]: That's a porno title, not an erotic song title.

2085
01:59:12,701 --> 01:59:13,141
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

2086
01:59:13,201 --> 01:59:13,481
[SPEAKER_27]: All right.

2087
01:59:14,482 --> 01:59:15,402
[SPEAKER_25]: So here's the list.

2088
01:59:15,642 --> 01:59:19,403
[SPEAKER_25]: Guys, guys, I heard about this Legend of Cumshot song.

2089
01:59:19,443 --> 01:59:21,884
[SPEAKER_25]: You have to double a temple of butt to get it.

2090
01:59:22,144 --> 01:59:22,604
It's going to go...

2091
01:59:23,522 --> 01:59:25,164
[SPEAKER_27]: Alright, here we go.

2092

[SPEAKER_27]: And Jamie's going to read them this time.

2095
01:59:30,269 --> 01:59:32,291

[SPEAKER_19]: Smells like fish, pink taco mix.

2100
01:59:43,163 --> 01:59:45,065
[SPEAKER_19]: Orgasmic fantasy for extreme sex.

[SPEAKER_19]: Temple of Butt, Sam Lick My Clam, 100 Midget Game Bang, The Legend of Cumshot, and Ladies Night Eat Out.

2102
01:59:52,499 --> 02:00:03,567
[SPEAKER_27]: Alright, and I gotta post that again to the chat room, because Chat Cookie, uh, Chat Cookie kicked me for flooding, so I'm gonna de-op it and repost the list, so I don't get, so I don't get, uh, kicked again.

[SPEAKER_27]: Uh, any other comments for anybody?

2107
02:00:14,275 --> 02:00:14,335
[SPEAKER_19]: Um...

2108
02:00:15,985 --> 02:00:18,306
[SPEAKER_19]: That's just like the nastiest list ever and I love it.

2109
02:00:19,086 --> 02:00:19,466
[SPEAKER_19]: Damn it.

2110
02:00:21,987 --> 02:00:23,107
[SPEAKER_27]: Chat Cookie's flipping out.

2111
02:00:26,028 --> 02:00:27,808
[SPEAKER_27]: Chat Cookie's being an asshole.

2112
02:00:27,828 --> 02:00:29,049
[SPEAKER_27]: Alright, alright, thank you.

2113

[SPEAKER_27]: Okay, in the meantime, let's see.

2114
02:00:33,550 --> 02:00:35,270
[SPEAKER_27]: I said I'd give inspiration.

2115
02:00:36,251 --> 02:00:38,331
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm trying to find another erotic song we haven't played yet.

2116
02:00:38,931 --> 02:00:39,571
[SPEAKER_27]: Sex on the Phone?

2117
02:00:40,412 --> 02:00:41,112
[SPEAKER_27]: I don't even know.

2118
02:00:41,932 --> 02:00:42,552

[SPEAKER_27]: Send in the votes.

02:04:37,822 --> 02:04:39,285
[SPEAKER_27]: So send it now or never send it.

[SPEAKER_01]: And now it's time for Erotic Pop Idol, where we will find the next singer for everyone's favorite perverse Bomani band, Erotic.

2135
02:06:22,043 --> 02:06:22,944
[SPEAKER_16]: Do it all night.

2136
02:06:23,204 --> 02:06:24,045
[SPEAKER_16]: Do it with me.

2137
02:06:24,505 --> 02:06:25,886
[SPEAKER_16]: No, no, that was awful.

2138
02:06:25,966 --> 02:06:26,826
[SPEAKER_10]: Bloody terrible.

2139
02:06:26,886 --> 02:06:28,227
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you take vocal lessons?

2140
02:06:28,307 --> 02:06:29,288
[SPEAKER_10]: Kill your teacher.

2141
02:06:29,788 --> 02:06:30,789
[SPEAKER_10]: In the heat of the night.

2142
02:06:31,249 --> 02:06:33,491
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, God, I think my ears are bleeding.

2143
02:06:34,672 --> 02:06:35,352
[SPEAKER_16]: I liked it.

2144
02:06:35,852 --> 02:06:37,413
[SPEAKER_10]: Shut the bloody hell up, Paula.

2145
02:06:37,514 --> 02:06:37,934
[SPEAKER_10]: Next.

2146
02:06:43,678 --> 02:06:45,439
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you even know why you're here?

2147
02:06:45,459 --> 02:06:47,240
[SPEAKER_10]: That was just bloody pathetic!

2148
02:06:47,300 --> 02:06:47,781
[SPEAKER_10]: Next!

2149
02:06:53,144 --> 02:06:53,344
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes!

2150
02:06:53,764 --> 02:06:54,385
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, that's it!

2151
02:06:54,745 --> 02:06:55,886
[SPEAKER_10]: We have a winner!

2152
02:06:56,706 --> 02:07:00,609
[SPEAKER_01]: A Star is Born, here on Orange Lounge Radio.

2153
02:07:01,776 --> 02:07:12,161
[SPEAKER_27]: Alright, we have the results for what has been one of our most popular, I think, I think it's one of our most popular listless segments we've ever done here on this show.

2154
02:07:12,261 --> 02:07:13,242
[SPEAKER_27]: It was fun, that's for sure.

2155
02:07:13,442 --> 02:07:15,663
[SPEAKER_27]: You remember that adult content disclaimer at the beginning of the show?

2156
02:07:15,703 --> 02:07:16,464
[SPEAKER_27]: I hope y'all were listening.

2157
02:07:16,564 --> 02:07:17,584
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, pay attention.

2158
02:07:17,684 --> 02:07:24,728
[SPEAKER_27]: And when I posted about this on the DDR Community Live Journal, I put, you know, warning, there's some adult content on this program if y'all are like 12 years old.

2159
02:07:26,949 --> 02:07:28,630
[SPEAKER_27]: Everybody wants to hear, some!

2160
02:07:29,290 --> 02:07:31,214
[SPEAKER_27]: Don't you ever talk about DDR on that show?

2161
02:07:31,274 --> 02:07:32,175
[SPEAKER_27]: All you ever talk about is porn.

2162
02:07:32,215 --> 02:07:32,736
[SPEAKER_27]: Oh yes, the list.

2163
02:07:32,756 --> 02:07:33,017
[SPEAKER_27]: Here we go.

2164
02:07:34,547 --> 02:07:40,631
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm going to give Jamie the distinct pleasure of getting to read these because we all love when a woman is saying these dirty things to us.

2165
02:07:40,971 --> 02:07:41,552
[SPEAKER_27]: Number three.

2166
02:07:41,692 --> 02:07:43,953
[SPEAKER_27]: Alright, the number three winner is... I like it in the ass.

2167
02:07:44,193 --> 02:07:45,394
[SPEAKER_27]: No, that wasn't one of the choices.

2168
02:07:46,235 --> 02:07:47,736
[SPEAKER_27]: Last week on Orange Lounge Radio.

2169
02:07:47,856 --> 02:07:48,116
[SPEAKER_19]: Shut up.

2170
02:07:48,756 --> 02:07:50,017
[SPEAKER_19]: We don't even do this anymore.

2171
02:07:50,077 --> 02:07:50,337
[SPEAKER_27]: Alright.

2172
02:07:50,838 --> 02:07:52,198
[SPEAKER_19]: Number three is Temple of Butt.

2173
02:07:52,599 --> 02:07:54,140
[SPEAKER_02]: Yay, Temple of Butt.

2174
02:07:54,320 --> 02:07:54,580
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

2175
02:07:56,521 --> 02:07:58,722
[SPEAKER_19]: Number two, 100 Midget Gangbang.

2176
02:07:58,803 --> 02:08:00,784
[SPEAKER_02]: Yay, 100 Midget Gangbang, yay.

2177
02:08:01,664 --> 02:08:02,545
[SPEAKER_19]: And number one is...

2178
02:08:03,678 --> 02:08:04,818
[SPEAKER_19]: Sam Lick My Clam.

2179
02:08:05,138 --> 02:08:06,899
[SPEAKER_27]: Sam Lick My Clam.

2180
02:08:07,099 --> 02:08:08,779
[SPEAKER_27]: Wow, that was a last minute entry too.

2181
02:08:09,660 --> 02:08:10,320
[SPEAKER_19]: And you know what?

2182
02:08:10,740 --> 02:08:11,020
[SPEAKER_27]: What?

2183
02:08:11,400 --> 02:08:12,260
[SPEAKER_19]: It's all three of us.

2184
02:08:13,081 --> 02:08:14,181
[SPEAKER_19]: It's the host circle.

2185
02:08:14,681 --> 02:08:15,481
[SPEAKER_27]: Ah, that's true.

2186
02:08:15,501 --> 02:08:17,722
[SPEAKER_19]: With of course me being number one because I'm the best.

2187
02:08:18,402 --> 02:08:20,283
[SPEAKER_19]: And you all love me and worship me like the goddess I am.

2188
02:08:20,403 --> 02:08:23,523
[SPEAKER_27]: Yay, okay, so Sam Lick My Clam is where I still like Temple of Bud.

2189
02:08:23,544 --> 02:08:24,684
[SPEAKER_19]: See, Brad's bowing down to me.

2190
02:08:24,704 --> 02:08:28,605
[SPEAKER_19]: I still like watching my ex have hot man sex.

2191
02:08:29,368 --> 02:08:29,889
[SPEAKER_27]: That was a good one.

2192
02:08:29,909 --> 02:08:30,730
[SPEAKER_27]: That was very close.

2193
02:08:30,750 --> 02:08:31,452
[SPEAKER_27]: It was very close.

2194
02:08:31,492 --> 02:08:32,414
[SPEAKER_27]: That was almost in there.

2195
02:08:33,696 --> 02:08:35,680
[SPEAKER_27]: Brad, can you sing us Temple of But one more time?

2196
02:08:38,265 --> 02:08:38,445
[SPEAKER_27]: What?

2197
02:08:39,780 --> 02:08:40,700
[SPEAKER_24]: The Temple of Butt.

2198
02:08:40,880 --> 02:08:41,221
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay.

2199
02:08:41,741 --> 02:08:43,022
[SPEAKER_24]: The Temple of Butt.

2200
02:08:43,362 --> 02:08:45,624
[SPEAKER_27]: Coming to the Temple of Butt.

2201
02:08:47,165 --> 02:08:47,746
[SPEAKER_27]: Alright, anyway.

2202
02:08:47,766 --> 02:08:49,847
[SPEAKER_19]: I was thinking it's the Winnie the Pootie.

2203
02:08:49,967 --> 02:08:51,088
[SPEAKER_27]: We still have a cage match.

2204
02:08:51,689 --> 02:08:52,910
[SPEAKER_27]: We still have a cage match to do.

2205
02:08:52,930 --> 02:08:53,951
[SPEAKER_19]: Temple of Butt.

2206
02:08:54,171 --> 02:08:55,071
[SPEAKER_27]: Okay, we want to do this?

2207
02:08:55,492 --> 02:08:55,752
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright.

2208
02:08:56,152 --> 02:08:57,053
[SPEAKER_27]: Loki, talk about this.

2209
02:08:57,073 --> 02:08:59,034
[SPEAKER_10]: Pootie, pootie, pootie, pootie, pootie, pootie.

2210
02:08:59,455 --> 02:09:00,536
[SPEAKER_10]: Temple of Butt.

2211
02:09:00,836 --> 02:09:02,877
[SPEAKER_10]: Pootie, pootie, pootie, pootie, pootie.

2212
02:09:04,335 --> 02:09:05,276
[SPEAKER_27]: Guys are weird.

2213
02:09:05,736 --> 02:09:11,401
[SPEAKER_27]: Suddenly I'm in preschool again, and we're all, everybody's sitting here going, poopy, pooky, caw, caw, caw, ha, ha, ha.

2214
02:09:11,661 --> 02:09:12,882
[SPEAKER_27]: I popped back out again.

2215
02:09:24,320 --> 02:09:30,923
[SPEAKER_27]: I still think this DNL thing is like the weirdest thing I've ever seen, that upside down seven.

2216
02:09:32,083 --> 02:09:35,224
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm so fucking hyper right now because of the goddamn balls.

2217
02:09:35,264 --> 02:09:36,585
[SPEAKER_25]: Jamie's high on balls.

2218
02:09:37,285 --> 02:09:39,466
[SPEAKER_19]: No, I've been cutting back on all my caffeine and sugar.

2219
02:09:40,266 --> 02:09:41,087
[SPEAKER_19]: and Ellen Piper.

2220
02:09:41,107 --> 02:09:43,308
[SPEAKER_26]: Okay, this is a remix I did.

2221
02:09:43,588 --> 02:09:44,989
[SPEAKER_26]: I worked on it most of today.

2222
02:09:45,690 --> 02:09:52,234
[SPEAKER_26]: The end is fucked up because it's not finished yet and I had to hurry to get it done so you'll notice that the rest of the song sounds cool in the end.

2223
02:09:52,254 --> 02:09:53,455
[SPEAKER_26]: You're like, huh?

2224
02:09:53,535 --> 02:09:57,818
[SPEAKER_26]: So this is a sort of trance remix of Legend of Max

2225
02:09:57,918 --> 02:09:58,699
[SPEAKER_27]: Now, why did you do this?

2226
02:09:58,759 --> 02:09:59,419
[SPEAKER_27]: Just for the hell of it?

2227
02:09:59,459 --> 02:10:01,741
[SPEAKER_27]: Or did you do it for that little contest that's going on on MyStyle?

2228
02:10:01,761 --> 02:10:02,381
[SPEAKER_26]: Or what's this about?

2229
02:10:02,421 --> 02:10:03,002
[SPEAKER_26]: I didn't know.

2230
02:10:03,502 --> 02:10:08,665
[SPEAKER_26]: I did it because I found the song that they got the vocals out of for Legend of Max, and that's the whole reason why.

2231
02:10:08,685 --> 02:10:09,646
[SPEAKER_26]: And I was like, woo!

2232
02:10:09,706 --> 02:10:10,267
[SPEAKER_26]: Vocals!

2233
02:10:11,107 --> 02:10:12,928
[SPEAKER_27]: So, are you going to enter this?

2234
02:10:12,968 --> 02:10:14,850
[SPEAKER_27]: You should enter this in the 2DX remixing contest.

2235
02:10:14,870 --> 02:10:17,972
[SPEAKER_27]: I know Legend of Max isn't a 2DX song yet, but, you know.

2236
02:10:18,012 --> 02:10:19,693
[SPEAKER_26]: You could call it a Max 300 mix, probably.

2237
02:10:19,713 --> 02:10:21,895
[SPEAKER_26]: For one, they canceled that contest.

2238
02:10:21,935 --> 02:10:22,155
[SPEAKER_26]: What?! !

2239
02:10:22,575 --> 02:10:25,577
[SPEAKER_26]: Hey, can you make me a trance mix of something?

2240
02:10:43,556 --> 02:10:44,837
[SPEAKER_27]: Make me a trance mix too!

2241
02:10:45,297 --> 02:10:46,718
[SPEAKER_27]: Come on, I want a trance mix!

2242
02:10:48,319 --> 02:10:49,120
[SPEAKER_27]: We'll see.

2243
02:10:49,180 --> 02:10:52,062
[SPEAKER_27]: I want someone to make me a trance mix of the Safari.

2244
02:10:52,102 --> 02:10:54,323
[SPEAKER_27]: We want to hear what you guys think about this in the chat room.

2245
02:10:54,463 --> 02:10:55,904
[SPEAKER_27]: So post your thoughts.

2246
02:10:56,685 --> 02:10:59,947
[SPEAKER_27]: You all can be a judge on American Idol right now and judge Loki.

2247
02:10:59,987 --> 02:11:00,887
[SPEAKER_27]: Won't this be fabulous?

2248
02:11:01,267 --> 02:11:03,289
[SPEAKER_27]: Okay, this is Legend of Trance here on Orange Lounge Radio.

2249
02:12:54,880 --> 02:12:55,580
[SPEAKER_19]: That was cool.

2250
02:12:55,620 --> 02:12:58,022
[SPEAKER_27]: Alright, let's pretend it was a cage match song.

2251
02:12:58,062 --> 02:12:58,683
[SPEAKER_27]: Let's go around the room.

2252
02:12:58,723 --> 02:13:01,044
[SPEAKER_27]: Everybody give your thoughts and give it on a scale of 1 to 10.

2253
02:13:02,185 --> 02:13:01,044
40.

2254
02:13:03,827 --> 02:13:04,928
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm wet right now.

2255
02:13:05,348 --> 02:13:07,510
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah, I'm going to give you 100.

2256
02:13:07,550 --> 02:13:08,210
[SPEAKER_23]: Change your pants.

2257
02:13:10,392 --> 02:13:12,614
[SPEAKER_23]: Already off the scale, but I'll give it a 9.

2258
02:13:14,548 --> 02:13:27,210
[SPEAKER_26]: Since it's my song, the end still needs work, especially that one, the second slowdown there where it says the death, and then the fly, I need to really work on that from there on, that needs work, but yeah, I like it, it's pretty cool.

2259
02:13:28,570 --> 02:13:39,132
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, let's just say it's off the scale, this one kicks hella ass, I can't really give it a number, because it's over 10 or over... Just to say, do be continued on the numbers scale.

2260
02:13:39,152 --> 02:13:43,073
[SPEAKER_27]: Okay, AAA then.

2261
02:13:44,122 --> 02:13:52,970
[SPEAKER_27]: You know, to be honest, it didn't sound a lot remixed, but like enough, so that like, you know, the paranoias aren't really remixed that much either.

2262
02:13:53,310 --> 02:13:57,013
[SPEAKER_27]: So, I think that fits into DDR very well.

2263
02:13:57,113 --> 02:13:59,295
[SPEAKER_07]: Compared to most of the damn mechs I've heard online.

2264
02:14:01,047 --> 02:14:04,590
[SPEAKER_26]: Actually, to be honest, I thought it was like hardly any Macs in there.

2265
02:14:04,710 --> 02:14:07,212
[SPEAKER_26]: I don't know, I just kind of heard the melody.

2266
02:14:07,252 --> 02:14:09,594
[SPEAKER_26]: Most of the stuff's off of TransAddict.com.

2267
02:14:10,215 --> 02:14:13,377
[SPEAKER_26]: I believe the song I used was called I'm Alone or something like that.

2268
02:14:13,397 --> 02:14:14,398
[SPEAKER_26]: That was for most of it.

2269
02:14:14,698 --> 02:14:20,984
[SPEAKER_26]: Then there's another song called, by the Deep Project, that's called The Fly, which is where they got most of the... Really?

2270
02:14:21,684 --> 02:14:22,905
[SPEAKER_26]: I've got the MP3 on there.

2271
02:14:22,925 --> 02:14:28,110
[SPEAKER_26]: It's like nine minutes long, but that's where they got the samples for that, unless that's a royalty-free sample that...

2272
02:14:28,830 --> 02:14:34,614
[SPEAKER_26]: Hey, I'll buy you dinner if you make me, like, an Ambia Trance remix of the Safari We'll see Safari kicks ass Anyway We'll see, okay, shit Dinner

2273
02:15:01,258 --> 02:15:06,380
[SPEAKER_27]: Alright, speaking of the cage match, I think we ought to get to this week's version of it, shouldn't we?

2274
02:15:08,181 --> 02:15:11,822
[SPEAKER_27]: Alright, so, let's get into that.

2275
02:15:14,043 --> 02:15:20,445
[SPEAKER_27]: Yes, so, I'm finding the cage match theme music here.

2276
02:15:20,625 --> 02:15:23,026
[SPEAKER_27]: Somebody requested it earlier in the show, we specifically not play.

2277
02:15:23,046 --> 02:15:24,406
[SPEAKER_27]: What are you taking that out for?

2278
02:15:24,426 --> 02:15:25,587
[SPEAKER_27]: We need that, don't we?

2279
02:15:27,168 --> 02:15:28,809
[SPEAKER_27]: Oh, mine's on there, but yours is on here.

2280
02:15:29,329 --> 02:15:30,590
[SPEAKER_27]: Okay.

2281
02:15:30,630 --> 02:15:31,551
[SPEAKER_27]: We'll do yours first, Loki.

2282
02:15:31,971 --> 02:15:32,351
[SPEAKER_27]: That's fine.

2283
02:15:32,431 --> 02:15:33,251
[SPEAKER_27]: Okay, put yours in.

2284
02:15:34,332 --> 02:15:35,173
[SPEAKER_27]: Okay, never mind.

2285
02:15:35,553 --> 02:15:36,113
[SPEAKER_27]: We know what we're doing.

2286
02:15:36,173 --> 02:15:37,554
[SPEAKER_27]: Anyway, yes, last week.

2287
02:15:39,015 --> 02:15:40,395
[SPEAKER_27]: Last week on the Orange Lounge Cage Match.

2288
02:15:40,476 --> 02:15:42,437
[SPEAKER_19]: Repriced from last week, KK Cockmaster.

2289
02:15:42,817 --> 02:15:43,757
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, wait, wrong week.

2290
02:15:44,618 --> 02:15:51,762
[SPEAKER_27]: We had, the winner was, Jamie brought in a Vincent D'Amour song, and it pretty much swept the floor.

2291
02:15:53,654 --> 02:15:55,755
[SPEAKER_27]: and it won, so we'll play a little clip of that.

2292
02:15:55,795 --> 02:16:03,878
[SPEAKER_27]: The way the cage match works, by the way, since I know we have a lot of new listeners tonight, each host brings in one song and we pick them all against each other.

2293
02:16:04,358 --> 02:16:08,400
[SPEAKER_27]: And so we have the winning song from last week and then two new ones that go head-to-head.

2294
02:16:08,740 --> 02:16:15,582
[SPEAKER_27]: The winning song goes into rotation on the Orange Lounge Radio's Bomani Music & More program, always on this station when we're not here, live.

2295
02:16:15,762 --> 02:16:15,962
[SPEAKER_27]: Yes.

2296
02:16:18,191 --> 02:16:18,831
[SPEAKER_27]: Head to Head.

2297
02:16:18,951 --> 02:16:19,792
[SPEAKER_27]: Yes, that's what I said.

2298
02:16:20,192 --> 02:16:20,872
[SPEAKER_27]: I said Head to Head.

2299
02:16:21,192 --> 02:16:22,993
[SPEAKER_27]: Anyway, last week, this was the winner.

2300
02:16:23,033 --> 02:16:25,834
[SPEAKER_27]: So this is the first song you can vote for in this week's Cage Max.

2301
02:16:26,474 --> 02:16:29,455
[SPEAKER_27]: We're just going to play a clip because the winner only gets a clip played of it.

2302
02:16:29,875 --> 02:16:34,077
[SPEAKER_27]: This is Vincent Damore with Eternity from last week here on Orange Lounge Radio.

2303
02:16:34,357 --> 02:16:34,757
[SPEAKER_27]: And now...

2304
02:17:36,849 --> 02:17:38,090
[SPEAKER_27]: Alright, that was last week's winner.

2305
02:17:38,130 --> 02:17:42,252
[SPEAKER_27]: That was Vincent Damore with Eternity, last week's winner.

2306
02:17:42,312 --> 02:17:44,173
[SPEAKER_19]: I just had a happy moment with that song.

2307
02:17:44,273 --> 02:17:46,755
[SPEAKER_27]: Already the chatroom is kind of slamming on Eternity.

2308
02:17:46,815 --> 02:17:48,476
[SPEAKER_27]: They don't know if they care for it anymore.

2309
02:17:48,536 --> 02:17:49,696
[SPEAKER_27]: I think they're done with it.

2310
02:17:50,177 --> 02:17:51,858
[SPEAKER_27]: So let's bring on the challengers.

2311
02:17:51,918 --> 02:17:53,779
[SPEAKER_27]: I don't know, Jamie looks concerned.

2312
02:17:54,959 --> 02:17:56,240
[SPEAKER_27]: She's giving the chatroom the finger.

2313
02:17:57,141 --> 02:17:58,241
[SPEAKER_26]: Alright, well let's see.

2314
02:17:58,321 --> 02:18:02,244
[SPEAKER_26]: I would have to say that this song falls on a completely opposite scale of that song.

2315
02:18:03,164 --> 02:18:10,591
[SPEAKER_26]: This is going to be, once again, the Secretions, a local Sacramento punk band, with their song, I'm Gonna Get You So Laid.

2316
02:18:11,012 --> 02:18:12,854
[SPEAKER_27]: Alright, so this is the next entry you can vote for.

2317
02:18:12,874 --> 02:18:17,058
[SPEAKER_27]: This is a very short, DDR-sized song, but if you want to vote for it, do it.

2318
02:18:17,118 --> 02:18:19,320
[SPEAKER_27]: This is the second pick in the Orange Lounge Cage Match.

2319
02:18:19,360 --> 02:18:22,003
[SPEAKER_27]: This is the Secretions with I'm Gonna Get You So Laid.

2320
02:18:36,344 --> 02:18:37,125
Thanks for watching!

2321
02:19:17,308 --> 02:19:19,209
[SPEAKER_11]: Take it to the money shop, boys!

2322
02:19:39,978 --> 02:19:42,782
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you very much for coming tonight.

2323
02:19:53,271 --> 02:19:57,113
[SPEAKER_27]: Alright, that was the secretions with I'm Gonna Get You So Laid.

2324
02:19:57,534 --> 02:19:59,755
[SPEAKER_27]: Let's go around the room and see what everyone thought of that.

2325
02:19:59,795 --> 02:20:00,015
[SPEAKER_27]: Jamie?

2326
02:20:00,035 --> 02:20:00,755
[SPEAKER_11]: We're talking about pain.

2327
02:20:01,336 --> 02:20:02,376
[SPEAKER_27]: Anyway, the secretions.

2328
02:20:02,396 --> 02:20:03,377
[SPEAKER_27]: What about the cage match pick?

2329
02:20:04,337 --> 02:20:05,018
[SPEAKER_19]: Um, cool.

2330
02:20:05,198 --> 02:20:06,218
[SPEAKER_19]: Um, seven.

2331
02:20:06,519 --> 02:20:06,859
[SPEAKER_27]: Seven.

2332
02:20:07,739 --> 02:20:08,640
[SPEAKER_27]: What'd you think of that, Zero?

2333
02:20:09,881 --> 02:20:13,182
[SPEAKER_23]: Um, since I've heard that song before and I enjoyed it, I'll say an eight.

2334
02:20:13,623 --> 02:20:13,943
[SPEAKER_23]: An eight.

2335
02:20:14,323 --> 02:20:14,984
[SPEAKER_27]: Alright, Loki?

2336
02:20:15,284 --> 02:20:20,467
[SPEAKER_26]: I'll give it a nine, but I know a lot of the chat room doesn't listen to punks, so they won't appreciate it as much as I do.

2337
02:20:21,287 --> 02:20:23,671
[SPEAKER_27]: Well, gee, aren't we elitists when it comes to music?

2338
02:20:23,771 --> 02:20:24,412
[SPEAKER_26]: Exactly.

2339
02:20:24,892 --> 02:20:26,434
[SPEAKER_27]: All right, and Jonas, your pick.

2340
02:20:27,035 --> 02:20:26,434
7.5.

2341
02:20:27,055 --> 02:20:29,719
[SPEAKER_27]: 7.5.

2342
02:20:27,135 --> 02:20:29,719
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm going to give it a 5.

2343
02:20:30,019 --> 02:20:31,121
[SPEAKER_27]: I've heard better punk.

2344
02:20:31,141 --> 02:20:36,568
[SPEAKER_27]: It was all right, but Little Bitch is better for DDR, but Pain is better than that.

2345
02:20:37,709 --> 02:20:38,469
[SPEAKER_27]: It was alright.

2346
02:20:39,410 --> 02:20:43,611
[SPEAKER_27]: If I was at a concert, I'd want to punch somebody to that song, so that's cool.

2347
02:20:43,891 --> 02:20:46,192
[SPEAKER_27]: But it's not for Orange Lounge, though.

2348
02:20:46,232 --> 02:20:47,713
[SPEAKER_27]: It ain't for Orange Lounge, I don't think.

2349
02:20:48,513 --> 02:20:48,993
[SPEAKER_27]: We'll see.

2350
02:20:49,913 --> 02:20:50,333
[SPEAKER_27]: We'll see.

2351
02:20:52,334 --> 02:20:54,735
[SPEAKER_27]: Alright, so that's your other pick.

2352
02:20:54,875 --> 02:20:55,095
[SPEAKER_19]: Alright.

2353
02:20:58,817 --> 02:21:01,800
[SPEAKER_27]: We have Vincent Noir with Eternity, The Supretions, and I'm Gonna Get You So Late.

2354
02:21:01,820 --> 02:21:02,961
[SPEAKER_27]: And here's the third pick.

2355
02:21:03,402 --> 02:21:05,404
[SPEAKER_27]: And I don't have an artist for this one.

2356
02:21:05,424 --> 02:21:06,725
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm trying to get that this week.

2357
02:21:06,865 --> 02:21:13,052
[SPEAKER_27]: But this was actually given to me by our buddy Tal, who was here earlier in the show.

2358
02:21:13,792 --> 02:21:15,574
[SPEAKER_27]: He had this posted on his website.

2359
02:21:15,594 --> 02:21:18,617
[SPEAKER_27]: This is a song called The Terrible Mr. Grimshaw.

2360
02:21:18,958 --> 02:21:19,819
[SPEAKER_27]: And what this is, this is...

2361
02:21:20,419 --> 02:21:25,001
[SPEAKER_27]: They recorded some guy playing Counter-Strike or Half-Life or one of those life-killing games.

2362
02:21:25,742 --> 02:21:32,805
[SPEAKER_27]: And they taped this guy playing it and swearing, and then they did a techno remix of it, and it kicks ass.

2363
02:21:33,145 --> 02:21:34,125
[SPEAKER_27]: So you guys have to hear this.

2364
02:21:34,366 --> 02:21:36,066
[SPEAKER_27]: This is my pick for the cage match this week.

2365
02:21:36,086 --> 02:21:38,968
[SPEAKER_27]: This is the terrible Mr. Grimshaw here on Orange Lounge Radio.

2366
02:21:42,242 --> 02:21:44,303
Thank you for watching!

2367
02:22:53,837 --> 02:22:54,197
[SPEAKER_09]: Goddammit!

2368
02:22:54,497 --> 02:22:55,217
[SPEAKER_09]: Goddammit!

2369
02:22:55,457 --> 02:22:56,298
[SPEAKER_09]: Goddammit!

2370
02:22:56,418 --> 02:22:56,798
[SPEAKER_09]: Fuck!

2371
02:22:57,418 --> 02:22:58,298
[SPEAKER_09]: Goddammit!

2372
02:22:58,398 --> 02:22:59,279
[SPEAKER_09]: Goddammit!

2373
02:22:59,379 --> 02:23:00,299
[SPEAKER_09]: Goddammit!

2374
02:23:00,359 --> 02:23:00,819
[SPEAKER_09]: Fuck!

2375
02:23:01,319 --> 02:23:02,280
[SPEAKER_09]: Goddammit!

2376
02:23:02,320 --> 02:23:03,200
[SPEAKER_09]: Goddammit!

2377
02:23:03,260 --> 02:23:04,200
[SPEAKER_09]: Goddammit!

2378
02:23:04,240 --> 02:23:04,660
[SPEAKER_09]: Fuck!

2379
02:23:05,200 --> 02:23:06,201
[SPEAKER_09]: Goddammit!

2380
02:23:06,241 --> 02:23:07,221
[SPEAKER_09]: Goddammit!

2381
02:23:07,241 --> 02:23:08,041
[SPEAKER_09]: Goddammit!

2382
02:23:08,081 --> 02:23:09,062
[SPEAKER_09]: Motherfuck!

2383
02:23:09,162 --> 02:23:10,662
[SPEAKER_09]: Goddamn!

2384
02:23:30,181 --> 02:23:32,263
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't shoot at me!

2385
02:23:40,491 --> 02:23:41,012
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, come on!

2386
02:23:41,052 --> 02:23:41,852
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't shoot at me!

2387
02:23:54,502 --> 02:23:55,542
[SPEAKER_09]: I hate that!

2388
02:23:55,902 --> 02:23:57,043
[SPEAKER_09]: Did I even get anyone?

2389
02:23:57,083 --> 02:23:59,603
[SPEAKER_09]: Did I ever fucking kill anyone?

2390
02:23:59,623 --> 02:24:00,904
[SPEAKER_09]: Did I even get anyone?

2391
02:24:00,944 --> 02:24:04,145
[SPEAKER_09]: Did I ever fucking kill anyone?

2392
02:24:04,165 --> 02:24:05,465
[SPEAKER_09]: Dude, what the fuck?

2393
02:24:05,665 --> 02:24:07,326
[SPEAKER_09]: How did I get fucking shot?

2394
02:24:07,586 --> 02:24:11,367
[SPEAKER_09]: Just quit shooting me the fucking fucking assholes, dude.

2395
02:24:11,407 --> 02:24:13,567
[SPEAKER_09]: What the fuck happened?

2396
02:24:13,907 --> 02:24:14,648
[SPEAKER_09]: Bullshit.

2397
02:24:14,768 --> 02:24:17,709
[SPEAKER_09]: I fucking shot you like 50 fucking times!

2398
02:24:17,809 --> 02:24:18,049
[SPEAKER_09]: Fuck!

2399
02:24:27,182 --> 02:24:27,984
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, my head!

2400
02:24:28,024 --> 02:24:28,385
[SPEAKER_09]: Shit!

2401
02:24:28,526 --> 02:24:28,826
[SPEAKER_09]: Fuck!

2402
02:25:00,984 --> 02:25:03,306
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, I'm not fucking playing with any of you.

2403
02:25:05,068 --> 02:25:08,631
[SPEAKER_27]: Alright, that was, I'm being told the name of the group.

2404
02:25:08,651 --> 02:25:09,932
[SPEAKER_27]: Ooh, that's too loud.

2405
02:25:10,612 --> 02:25:11,913
[SPEAKER_27]: Hi, I'm back.

2406
02:25:12,714 --> 02:25:17,778
[SPEAKER_27]: The name of the group is the Murder Simulators, and that was the terrible Mr. Grimshaw.

2407
02:25:19,140 --> 02:25:22,342
[SPEAKER_27]: Jamie already expressed her disgust for this song, but let's hear it.

2408
02:25:23,826 --> 02:25:26,771
[SPEAKER_19]: If it had a good background music, I would give it a higher score.

2409
02:25:27,292 --> 02:25:30,357
[SPEAKER_19]: If it was insecure, I would give it a higher score.

2410
02:25:30,798 --> 02:25:34,504
[SPEAKER_19]: But I hear that all the time, just hanging out with Dan.

2411
02:25:35,025 --> 02:25:37,530
[SPEAKER_19]: And hearing him talk shit on MechaSold on Xbox Live.

2412
02:25:38,306 --> 02:25:39,107
[SPEAKER_19]: So I give that a 2.

2413
02:25:39,207 --> 02:25:40,768
[SPEAKER_19]: You give it a 2.

2414
02:25:40,808 --> 02:25:43,391
[SPEAKER_19]: Because at least parts of it weren't keyed.

2415
02:25:43,871 --> 02:25:45,633
[SPEAKER_23]: Alright, 0.

2416
02:25:46,854 --> 02:25:52,859
[SPEAKER_23]: I don't know, I've played quite a bit of Half-Life and Counter-Strike, so I can understand the guy's frustration.

2417
02:25:53,440 --> 02:25:57,824
[SPEAKER_23]: So I'd say I'd give that a 6.5, purely by his frustration.

2418
02:25:58,244 --> 02:25:59,005
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, Loki.

2419
02:25:59,765 --> 02:26:00,987
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, lead it, honky!

2420
02:26:03,329 --> 02:26:03,969
[SPEAKER_26]: Love that line.

2421
02:26:06,120 --> 02:26:23,145
[SPEAKER_26]: I'll give it like a 6 because it didn't even really, it doesn't look like they paid, they just were trying to put his samples in there just to make it like a song, but they didn't really pay much attention to the actual background music, so it's like, I don't know, 6, yeah.

2422
02:26:23,686 --> 02:26:25,246
[SPEAKER_27]: Alright, Jonas, what'd you think?

2423
02:26:25,446 --> 02:26:26,246
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll give it like a 4.

2424
02:26:26,306 --> 02:26:31,548
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, first of all, there's really not much to the song at all.

2425
02:26:35,211 --> 02:26:39,513
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to make a band and call it Slagwork.

2426
02:27:02,972 --> 02:27:05,653
[SPEAKER_19]: If I started doing mixes, I would just go as flag one.

2427
02:27:05,893 --> 02:27:08,335
[SPEAKER_27]: Vote now for the Orange Lounge Cage Match winner.

2428
02:27:08,395 --> 02:27:09,335
[SPEAKER_27]: Here's your choices.

2429
02:27:09,415 --> 02:27:12,557

02:27:18,479 --> 02:27:21,241
[SPEAKER_27]: The secretions with I'm Gonna Get You So Late.

2431
02:27:22,741 --> 02:27:24,042
[SPEAKER_27]: And it's queuing up right now.

2432
02:27:24,622 --> 02:27:25,483
[SPEAKER_27]: La la la.

[SPEAKER_27]: Dammit.

02:27:31,466 --> 02:27:31,726
[SPEAKER_27]: Fuck.

02:27:31,766 --> 02:27:32,066
[SPEAKER_27]: Come on.

2439
02:27:32,910 --> 02:27:34,550
[SPEAKER_27]: Oh my gosh.

2440
02:27:34,730 --> 02:27:35,491
[SPEAKER_26]: Oh shit.

2441
02:27:35,651 --> 02:27:41,492
[SPEAKER_27]: I can sing it.

2442
02:27:41,592 --> 02:27:43,253
[SPEAKER_26]: Uh-oh.

2443
02:27:43,873 --> 02:27:46,793
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that song just broke Orange Lounge Radio.

2444
02:27:47,454 --> 02:27:47,714
[SPEAKER_27]: Don't!

2445
02:27:48,034 --> 02:27:48,414
[SPEAKER_27]: Fuck.

2446
02:27:50,654 --> 02:27:51,194
[SPEAKER_27]: Alright.

2447
02:27:51,775 --> 02:27:55,616
[SPEAKER_27]: So... Boy, we're kind of screwed here.

2448
02:27:56,096 --> 02:27:57,036
[SPEAKER_27]: Hold on just one sec.

2449
02:27:57,396 --> 02:27:58,036
[SPEAKER_27]: I didn't do it!

2450
02:27:58,576 --> 02:27:59,596
[SPEAKER_27]: Someone fill time here.

2451
02:27:59,616 --> 02:28:00,897
[SPEAKER_26]: It wasn't me.

2452
02:28:07,141 --> 02:28:09,042
[SPEAKER_27]: All right, so did Winamp close?

2453
02:28:09,242 --> 02:28:09,602
[SPEAKER_27]: Hurry up.

2454
02:28:10,563 --> 02:28:11,503
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, shit.

2455
02:28:13,725 --> 02:28:14,425
[SPEAKER_27]: All right, hold on.

2456
02:28:14,785 --> 02:28:16,506
[SPEAKER_27]: Okay, we're not going to be able to play a... Uh-oh.

2457
02:28:16,746 --> 02:28:18,527
[SPEAKER_27]: Did the whole computer just freeze up there?

2458
02:28:20,789 --> 02:28:21,249
[SPEAKER_27]: Shit.

2459
02:28:23,570 --> 02:28:25,131
[SPEAKER_27]: Loki, you broke Orange Lounge!

2460
02:28:25,171 --> 02:28:25,992
[SPEAKER_27]: Here, pop the CDF.

2461
02:28:28,133 --> 02:28:28,794
[SPEAKER_27]: This is bad.

2462
02:28:30,293 --> 02:28:31,334
[SPEAKER_27]: This is fucked up.

2463
02:28:31,354 --> 02:28:31,874
[SPEAKER_26]: Dude, move.

2464
02:28:32,074 --> 02:28:33,294
[SPEAKER_26]: And let me pop the fucking CD out.

2465
02:28:33,314 --> 02:28:33,735
[SPEAKER_26]: Where is it?

2466
02:28:34,015 --> 02:28:34,335
[SPEAKER_26]: Right there.

2467
02:28:34,355 --> 02:28:34,755
[SPEAKER_26]: Top one.

2468
02:28:34,795 --> 02:28:35,115
[SPEAKER_27]: Top one.

2469
02:28:35,335 --> 02:28:35,756
[SPEAKER_27]: Hold on.

2470
02:28:35,796 --> 02:28:36,676
[SPEAKER_27]: We got technical issues.

2471
02:28:38,597 --> 02:28:39,177
[SPEAKER_19]: We're sorry.

2472
02:28:39,257 --> 02:28:42,499
[SPEAKER_19]: This broadcast of Orange Challenge Radio just got fucked up by Loki.

2473
02:28:43,019 --> 02:28:43,239
[SPEAKER_19]: Sorry.

2474
02:28:43,860 --> 02:28:45,461
[SPEAKER_27]: All right, there, finally, it's out.

2475
02:28:45,481 --> 02:28:46,222
[SPEAKER_19]: The media has escaped.

2476
02:28:46,262 --> 02:28:47,683
[SPEAKER_19]: Loki pulled it out, hooray.

2477
02:28:47,703 --> 02:28:48,444
[SPEAKER_19]: Yay, we're fixed.

2478
02:28:48,544 --> 02:28:51,226
[SPEAKER_27]: All right, so you can vote for the song that broke Orange Lounge.

2479
02:28:51,286 --> 02:28:52,447
[SPEAKER_19]: We can now no longer breathe.

2480
02:28:53,208 --> 02:28:59,132
[SPEAKER_27]: Or you can vote for, and now I, damn it, now, okay, or you can vote for the song with the swearing, The Terrible Mr. Grinchon.

2481
02:28:59,152 --> 02:29:00,674
[SPEAKER_27]: You don't get to hear a clip of that either because I'm lazy.

2482
02:29:00,694 --> 02:29:01,174
[SPEAKER_27]: I can hear mine, though.

2483
02:29:02,950 --> 02:29:05,411
[SPEAKER_27]: Fuck, shit, cock!

2484
02:29:06,511 --> 02:29:10,932
[SPEAKER_27]: Alright, so vote now, send those over private message to me, I'm Sky in the chatroom.

2485
02:29:11,673 --> 02:29:18,415
[SPEAKER_27]: And if you're not in the chatroom, get your ass in there right now, orangelounge.skie.cx Alright, so, moving right along.

2486
02:29:18,435 --> 02:29:19,835
[SPEAKER_27]: What do you guys want to talk about now?

2487
02:29:19,855 --> 02:29:20,955
[SPEAKER_27]: There's a half hour left to show here.

2488
02:29:23,816 --> 02:29:24,436
[SPEAKER_19]: I like liquor.

2489
02:29:25,057 --> 02:29:25,857
[SPEAKER_27]: Okay, wait a minute, what?

2490
02:29:28,002 --> 02:29:36,045
[SPEAKER_24]: I just started myself a little character in Jamie's Animal Crossing Town, and I can't get Irene to get off so I can play.

2491
02:29:36,806 --> 02:29:43,749
[SPEAKER_27]: Go in there and tell her it's your goddamn turn, and that she plays it every time she's over here, and it's your turn, because you only get to be here like once every month, so... Yeah.

2492
02:29:44,109 --> 02:29:44,369
[SPEAKER_27]: Ha.

2493
02:29:46,110 --> 02:29:47,570
[SPEAKER_27]: Go lay the smack down, puppy.

2494
02:29:48,651 --> 02:29:49,071
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah.

2495
02:29:49,491 --> 02:29:50,172
[SPEAKER_27]: Show him your bark.

2496
02:29:51,932 --> 02:29:53,033
[SPEAKER_27]: Irene needs to be on the show.

2497
02:29:55,692 --> 02:29:58,014
[SPEAKER_10]: Take it.

2498
02:29:58,054 --> 02:30:00,116
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah, we need more female input on this show.

2499
02:30:00,737 --> 02:30:01,257
[SPEAKER_27]: Hey!

2500
02:30:01,337 --> 02:30:02,678
[SPEAKER_27]: Jamie has to make up for everybody.

2501
02:30:03,359 --> 02:30:04,340
[SPEAKER_19]: I have tit power.

2502
02:30:05,961 --> 02:30:07,002
[SPEAKER_27]: I can pick a few females.

2503
02:30:08,303 --> 02:30:09,965
[SPEAKER_27]: Let's have an all-female Orange Lounge.

2504
02:30:10,906 --> 02:30:11,226
[SPEAKER_27]: Okay.

2505
02:30:11,286 --> 02:30:12,707
[SPEAKER_27]: Loki and I will leave town for the weekend.

2506
02:30:13,368 --> 02:30:14,249
We already did that.

2507
02:30:14,469 --> 02:30:15,270
[SPEAKER_27]: Oh, yeah, we did that.

2508
02:30:15,290 --> 02:30:15,710
[SPEAKER_19]: That's right.

2509
02:30:15,730 --> 02:30:16,691
[SPEAKER_19]: But Ross was there.

2510
02:30:16,711 --> 02:30:19,874
[SPEAKER_19]: It was me and Jessica, but we had Ross and Dan.

2511
02:30:20,959 --> 02:30:22,981
[SPEAKER_19]: Hey everybody, do you want Dan to be on the show again?

2512
02:30:23,421 --> 02:30:24,021
[SPEAKER_19]: Samir Boots.

2513
02:30:24,202 --> 02:30:25,663
[SPEAKER_19]: Yay!

2514
02:30:25,923 --> 02:30:34,690
[SPEAKER_19]: You know Dan's going to be on there when we do the show at my house.

2515
02:30:35,190 --> 02:30:36,691
[SPEAKER_13]: Buy my parrot hang gliders.

2516
02:30:42,556 --> 02:30:44,637
[SPEAKER_26]: Oh, oh, oh, I know what I want to talk about.

2517
02:30:45,318 --> 02:30:46,799
[SPEAKER_26]: This weird email I got.

2518
02:30:47,458 --> 02:30:50,361
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay, now... Okay, you people fucking have no taste.

2519
02:30:50,441 --> 02:30:51,181
[SPEAKER_19]: My God.

2520
02:30:51,201 --> 02:30:54,844
[SPEAKER_26]: Okay, whoever you were, you have taste.

2521
02:30:54,925 --> 02:30:55,205
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, yeah.

[SPEAKER_19]: Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck

2523
02:31:21,730 --> 02:31:22,811
[SPEAKER_26]: Sorry, that's the twin mail.

2524
02:31:23,291 --> 02:31:23,771
[SPEAKER_26]: No, twin mail.

2525
02:31:49,759 --> 02:31:51,060
[SPEAKER_26]: Okay, here goes.

2526
02:31:51,900 --> 02:32:01,906
[SPEAKER_26]: Dear friend, I know this email will reach you as a surprise, but need not to worry, as we are using the only secured and confidential medium available to seek foreign assistance.

2527
02:32:02,367 --> 02:32:06,889
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah, secure and confidential yet is going to someone else, and I got the email, supposedly.

2528
02:32:06,930 --> 02:32:08,490
[SPEAKER_19]: Matt, why is your butt in my face?

2529
02:32:09,411 --> 02:32:09,731
[SPEAKER_26]: I don't know.

2530
02:32:10,412 --> 02:32:10,732
[SPEAKER_26]: Anyways.

2531
02:32:11,807 --> 02:32:19,894
[SPEAKER_26]: So, following the sudden death of my husband, General Sonny Bacha, the late former head of State United... Give us a Cliff Notes version.

2532
02:32:20,874 --> 02:32:23,016
[SPEAKER_26]: Okay, some guy died.

2533
02:32:23,617 --> 02:32:28,260
[SPEAKER_26]: I want you to move my funds into the United States.

2534
02:32:28,280 --> 02:32:29,662
[SPEAKER_18]: You made me snort my Propel.

2535
02:32:29,722 --> 02:32:31,743
[SPEAKER_26]: I'll give you $21.5 million for doing that.

2536
02:32:34,185 --> 02:32:43,231
[SPEAKER_26]: And all you have to do is send me your full name, your company name and address, and phone numbers and fax numbers.

2537
02:32:45,032 --> 02:32:45,432
[SPEAKER_26]: And you're sold.

2538
02:32:47,173 --> 02:32:47,773
[SPEAKER_26]: To my lawyer.

2539
02:32:48,193 --> 02:32:49,114
[SPEAKER_19]: And a big black cock.

2540
02:32:49,354 --> 02:32:52,096
[SPEAKER_26]: So that was the dumb email they got.

2541
02:32:52,936 --> 02:32:56,819
[SPEAKER_26]: I thought it was all special and stuff, but then other people got the same email, so I guess not.

2542
02:33:00,201 --> 02:33:00,501
[SPEAKER_26]: But yeah.

2543
02:33:03,922 --> 02:33:04,763
[SPEAKER_26]: So, yeah.

2544
02:33:05,403 --> 02:33:05,823
[SPEAKER_26]: That's all.

2545
02:33:05,844 --> 02:33:07,124
[SPEAKER_26]: Pretty stupid.

2546
02:33:09,426 --> 02:33:10,327
[SPEAKER_27]: Spam sucks.

2547
02:33:10,707 --> 02:33:12,989
[SPEAKER_27]: Oh, that's what I was going to give an F you to this week and I forgot.

2548
02:33:13,029 --> 02:33:14,150
[SPEAKER_19]: I got to see Robin drag.

2549
02:33:15,311 --> 02:33:16,832
[SPEAKER_27]: Don't talk about that on this show.

2550
02:33:18,053 --> 02:33:19,354
[SPEAKER_27]: Alright, you can talk about it if you want.

2551
02:33:19,394 --> 02:33:20,755
[SPEAKER_19]: I got to see Robin drag.

2552
02:33:21,796 --> 02:33:22,416
[SPEAKER_19]: It was cool.

2553
02:33:23,537 --> 02:33:24,478
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm scarred for life.

2554
02:33:30,047 --> 02:33:32,287
[SPEAKER_19]: We have dead airspace!

2555
02:33:32,528 --> 02:33:36,168
[SPEAKER_27]: Sorry, I'm having to correct people that are voting for Loki's Legend of Max mix.

2556
02:33:36,208 --> 02:33:37,488
[SPEAKER_27]: That wasn't the cage match!

2557
02:33:37,528 --> 02:33:42,669
[SPEAKER_27]: That was a... We were just rating it like it was a cage match, but that wasn't really... We should have picked that as my cage match.

2558
02:33:43,209 --> 02:33:43,490
[SPEAKER_26]: Damn it.

2559
02:33:43,630 --> 02:33:47,610
[SPEAKER_26]: Oh, I gotta get Jahi's vote, because Jahi actually voted in the main charm, so he voted for that.

2560
02:33:47,790 --> 02:33:50,151
[SPEAKER_27]: Ooh, it's... Down the wire!

2561
02:33:51,671 --> 02:33:52,431
[SPEAKER_27]: Let's see, let's see.

2562
02:33:52,451 --> 02:33:55,132
[SPEAKER_27]: Uh-oh.

2563
02:33:55,772 --> 02:33:56,492
[SPEAKER_27]: Now it's tied.

2564
02:33:58,792 --> 02:34:00,413
[SPEAKER_27]: We need people to hurry up and send their votes.

2565
02:34:01,134 --> 02:34:03,336
[SPEAKER_27]: Jahi, I got your vote, so you don't have to send that over a message.

2566
02:34:03,356 --> 02:34:03,896
[SPEAKER_27]: I already got it.

2567
02:34:04,617 --> 02:34:04,937
[SPEAKER_27]: Alright.

2568
02:34:05,758 --> 02:34:09,862
[SPEAKER_19]: We need... I mean... No, no, no.

2569
02:34:10,002 --> 02:34:12,163
[SPEAKER_27]: We gotta wait and see if there's any more votes coming in the chatroom.

2570
02:34:12,604 --> 02:34:14,526
[SPEAKER_27]: Because there's still some people in the chatroom who haven't voted yet.

2571
02:34:14,686 --> 02:34:15,386
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, vote.

2572
02:34:15,626 --> 02:34:16,167
[SPEAKER_19]: Vote for me.

2573
02:34:17,028 --> 02:34:18,229
[SPEAKER_27]: So, it's... Oh, there's one.

2574
02:34:18,889 --> 02:34:19,410
[SPEAKER_27]: Oh, let's see.

2575
02:34:22,237 --> 02:34:24,799
[SPEAKER_27]: Oh, well, let's keep it open for a few more minutes.

2576
02:34:24,819 --> 02:34:25,399
[SPEAKER_27]: We'll see what happens.

2577
02:34:25,420 --> 02:34:25,900
[SPEAKER_27]: Okay.

2578
02:34:25,940 --> 02:34:26,200
[SPEAKER_27]: Alright.

2579
02:34:26,560 --> 02:34:28,622
[SPEAKER_19]: We'll give it ten seconds to get really good at it.

2580
02:34:28,662 --> 02:34:28,822
[SPEAKER_19]: No, no, no.

2581
02:34:28,862 --> 02:34:29,162
[SPEAKER_27]: Let's see.

2582
02:34:29,502 --> 02:34:31,124
[SPEAKER_27]: Let's talk about something else.

2583
02:34:32,365 --> 02:34:33,806
[SPEAKER_19]: How cool Vincent D'Amore is.

2584
02:34:35,066 --> 02:34:37,528
[SPEAKER_27]: Vincent D'Amore is cool, but he doesn't swear in his songs.

2585
02:34:38,489 --> 02:34:41,531
[SPEAKER_19]: He could swear in Icelandic or something.

2586
02:34:42,412 --> 02:34:43,472
[SPEAKER_27]: He'd be cooler if he did.

2587
02:34:44,313 --> 02:34:47,215
[SPEAKER_19]: No, just because something has swearing in it doesn't make it cool.

2588
02:34:47,235 --> 02:34:48,016
[SPEAKER_27]: Oh, okay.

2589
02:34:49,301 --> 02:34:51,603
[SPEAKER_27]: SoCal Kicks brings up a good thing we should talk about.

2590
02:34:51,623 --> 02:34:57,808
[SPEAKER_27]: I briefly mentioned this after the Milpitas Golf Land interviews, but we are going to be going to Cyber Beat Nation, Orange Lounge Radio.

2591
02:34:57,848 --> 02:34:59,109
[SPEAKER_27]: Well, at least I'm going.

2592
02:34:59,149 --> 02:35:02,252
[SPEAKER_19]: Fuck them for scheduling it on Valentine's Day.

2593
02:35:02,752 --> 02:35:03,373
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah, you know what?

2594
02:35:03,693 --> 02:35:08,277
[SPEAKER_27]: Since I'm the single one, Valentine's Day doesn't matter to me this year, so I'm going to go to L.A.

2595
02:35:08,317 --> 02:35:10,059
[SPEAKER_19]: It's my five-year anniversary with Dan.

2596
02:35:10,099 --> 02:35:11,200
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, congratulations, you guys.

2597
02:35:11,220 --> 02:35:11,860
[SPEAKER_27]: That's really cute.

2598
02:35:11,960 --> 02:35:12,581
[SPEAKER_19]: Give us presents.

2599
02:35:12,601 --> 02:35:12,901
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.

2600
02:35:14,474 --> 02:35:16,976
[SPEAKER_26]: Well, some other Bimani-related stuff.

2601
02:35:16,996 --> 02:35:21,059
[SPEAKER_26]: They released a second code for DVR Extreme, if anyone cares.

2602
02:35:21,099 --> 02:35:31,746
[SPEAKER_26]: You know, it releases Sync for Extreme, Twinbee, and also Burning the Floor Momo Mix, which is... Got the retarded speed-up in the middle.

2603
02:35:31,966 --> 02:35:34,148
[SPEAKER_26]: That song would do very good in Tourney Mix 3.

2604
02:35:36,910 --> 02:35:38,131
[SPEAKER_26]: Unnecessary speed-up.

2605
02:35:39,572 --> 02:35:40,092
[SPEAKER_26]: But, you know.

2606
02:35:41,573 --> 02:35:41,893
[SPEAKER_26]: So, yeah.

2607
02:35:44,019 --> 02:35:45,520
[SPEAKER_26]: That's all.

2608
02:35:46,801 --> 02:35:47,802
[SPEAKER_19]: Somebody else vote.

2609
02:35:49,102 --> 02:35:50,183
[SPEAKER_27]: Jenny Bean hasn't voted.

2610
02:35:50,223 --> 02:35:50,723
[SPEAKER_27]: Make her vote.

2611
02:35:50,804 --> 02:35:51,684
[SPEAKER_19]: Jenny Bean, vote.

2612
02:35:52,545 --> 02:35:53,345
[SPEAKER_19]: Who else hasn't voted?

2613
02:35:53,405 --> 02:35:54,506
[SPEAKER_19]: North Thailand hasn't voted.

2614
02:35:54,806 --> 02:35:56,947
[SPEAKER_19]: Vote for your fellow staff squad person.

2615
02:35:57,608 --> 02:35:58,308
[SPEAKER_27]: Who hasn't voted?

2616
02:35:58,348 --> 02:35:59,329
[SPEAKER_27]: Who am I going to single out here?

2617
02:35:59,389 --> 02:36:00,309
[SPEAKER_27]: Excel hasn't voted.

2618
02:36:00,529 --> 02:36:01,230
[SPEAKER_19]: Did Jahi vote?

2619
02:36:01,450 --> 02:36:02,190
[SPEAKER_27]: Jahi did vote.

2620
02:36:03,311 --> 02:36:03,351
Um...

2621
02:36:05,572 --> 02:36:06,493
[SPEAKER_27]: Did VidPower vote?

2622
02:36:06,913 --> 02:36:08,074
[SPEAKER_27]: No, he did.

2623
02:36:09,695 --> 02:36:10,436
[SPEAKER_27]: Slinky didn't vote.

2624
02:36:10,516 --> 02:36:11,557
[SPEAKER_19]: Slinky, vote for me.

2625
02:36:12,277 --> 02:36:12,557
[SPEAKER_27]: All right.

2626
02:36:13,138 --> 02:36:15,239
[SPEAKER_27]: We're naming people now who haven't voted.

2627
02:36:15,279 --> 02:36:16,380
[SPEAKER_19]: We're singling you out.

2628
02:36:16,840 --> 02:36:17,281
[SPEAKER_27]: Oh, okay.

2629
02:36:17,441 --> 02:36:18,342
[SPEAKER_27]: We got one from JB.

2630
02:36:18,382 --> 02:36:18,702
[SPEAKER_27]: Here we go.

2631
02:36:21,324 --> 02:36:22,084
[SPEAKER_27]: Oh, that wasn't a vote.

2632
02:36:23,105 --> 02:36:23,786
[SPEAKER_19]: JB, vote.

2633
02:36:25,067 --> 02:36:25,707
[SPEAKER_27]: JB, vote.

2634
02:36:25,847 --> 02:36:26,828
[SPEAKER_19]: It's all on your shoulders.

2635
02:36:27,849 --> 02:36:29,950
[SPEAKER_27]: Next vote is the final vote.

2636
02:36:29,990 --> 02:36:32,012
[SPEAKER_27]: Next vote is the final vote.

2637
02:36:32,532 --> 02:36:34,454
[SPEAKER_27]: And it's going to be the tiebreaker vote, possibly.

2638
02:36:36,972 --> 02:36:39,674
[SPEAKER_27]: So everything is tied and the next vote breaks it.

2639
02:36:39,734 --> 02:36:40,594
[SPEAKER_27]: Okay, here comes JB.

2640
02:36:42,835 --> 02:36:43,956
[SPEAKER_27]: Damn it, that wasn't a vote.

2641
02:36:44,576 --> 02:36:47,118
[SPEAKER_27]: Jenny Bean votes for... She didn't put anything.

2642
02:36:47,938 --> 02:36:48,779
[SPEAKER_27]: Alright, that's it.

2643
02:36:50,159 --> 02:36:51,600
[SPEAKER_27]: Jenny Bean breaks the tie.

2644
02:36:51,620 --> 02:36:53,861
[SPEAKER_27]: The page match is over.

2645
02:36:55,342 --> 02:36:56,583
[SPEAKER_27]: For the second week in a row.

2646
02:36:58,493 --> 02:36:58,993
[SPEAKER_27]: It wins.

2647
02:36:59,594 --> 02:37:00,194
[SPEAKER_27]: Nice try.

2648
02:37:00,615 --> 02:37:02,836
[SPEAKER_27]: USFEB tried cloning himself to vote again.

2649
02:37:03,677 --> 02:37:06,139
[SPEAKER_27]: Nice try, but you were five seconds too late, unfortunately.

2650
02:37:06,239 --> 02:37:09,121
[SPEAKER_27]: So, Eternity wins again for the second week.

2651
02:37:09,601 --> 02:37:14,645
[SPEAKER_27]: And, uh... The Grimshaw one will just have to be saved for the occasional fuck-off show.

2652
02:37:14,665 --> 02:37:15,305
[SPEAKER_27]: Sorry, kids.

2653
02:37:16,126 --> 02:37:18,908
[SPEAKER_27]: But yes, I'll send that to you guys that wanted it after the show.

2654
02:37:19,048 --> 02:37:20,469
[SPEAKER_27]: Or you can visit Tal's website.

2655
02:37:20,509 --> 02:37:24,232
[SPEAKER_27]: He has it, but... Ask Tal when he comes back in the chatroom where his website is, because that's where I got it from.

2656
02:37:24,792 --> 02:37:25,032
[SPEAKER_27]: Okay.

2657
02:37:26,153 --> 02:37:27,074
[SPEAKER_27]: So the cage match is over.

2658
02:37:27,454 --> 02:37:28,194
[SPEAKER_27]: Eternity wins again.

2659
02:37:28,214 --> 02:37:29,635
[SPEAKER_10]: Play it again.

2660
02:37:29,675 --> 02:37:31,456
[SPEAKER_27]: What do you mean, play it again?

2661
02:37:32,596 --> 02:37:33,457
[SPEAKER_10]: Play it again, Rob.

2662
02:37:33,897 --> 02:37:34,777
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm not going to play it again.

2663
02:37:35,778 --> 02:37:36,738
[SPEAKER_27]: It already won, dammit.

2664
02:37:38,359 --> 02:37:41,641
[SPEAKER_26]: If you want to take a huge break, we can play E-Fly.

2665
02:37:41,881 --> 02:37:43,382
[SPEAKER_27]: I don't want to play that 9 minute song, no way.

2666
02:37:45,069 --> 02:37:45,970
[SPEAKER_27]: I don't think any of us will say this.

2667
02:37:45,990 --> 02:37:46,430
[SPEAKER_26]: Alright, here it is.

2668
02:37:46,510 --> 02:37:50,212
[SPEAKER_27]: Alright, we got it.

2669
02:37:50,452 --> 02:37:50,953
[SPEAKER_27]: Hey!

2670
02:37:52,133 --> 02:37:52,554
[SPEAKER_27]: Alright.

2671
02:37:53,994 --> 02:37:55,375
[SPEAKER_10]: You're just jealous.

2672
02:37:55,475 --> 02:37:56,816
[SPEAKER_27]: Yes, that's right, I am jealous.

2673
02:37:57,156 --> 02:37:57,637
[SPEAKER_19]: Fuck!

2674
02:37:57,997 --> 02:37:58,537
[SPEAKER_19]: Shit!

2675
02:37:59,478 --> 02:38:01,639
[SPEAKER_19]: This kick to Rob's knee was brought to you by Propel.

2676
02:38:02,360 --> 02:38:02,540
[SPEAKER_19]: Ow!

2677
02:38:04,401 --> 02:38:04,681
[SPEAKER_27]: Alright.

2678
02:38:06,882 --> 02:38:09,444
[SPEAKER_27]: Anyway, moving along.

2679
02:38:09,464 --> 02:38:10,965
[SPEAKER_27]: Moving right along.

2680
02:38:11,864 --> 02:38:16,326
[SPEAKER_27]: Moving on up, moving on up to this Muppet movie.

2681
02:38:16,626 --> 02:38:17,726
[SPEAKER_27]: Mmm, tastes like Muppet.

2682
02:38:20,087 --> 02:38:20,507
[SPEAKER_27]: Anything else?

2683
02:38:20,607 --> 02:38:24,548
[SPEAKER_27]: Oh, that's a good erotic song title.

2684
02:38:24,568 --> 02:38:25,249
[SPEAKER_27]: Tastes like Muppet.

2685
02:38:25,289 --> 02:38:26,069
[SPEAKER_27]: Tastes like Muppet.

2686
02:38:28,610 --> 02:38:29,510
[SPEAKER_27]: Um, what else?

2687
02:38:29,650 --> 02:38:32,771
[SPEAKER_27]: Is there anything like... Treat me like a Muppet and stick your hand up my ass.

2688
02:38:35,859 --> 02:38:36,859
[SPEAKER_27]: Puppet like a Muppet.

2689
02:38:40,621 --> 02:38:42,321
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm sure you guys could be very creative.

2690
02:38:42,361 --> 02:38:43,582
[SPEAKER_09]: Ah, such a busy schedule.

2691
02:38:43,642 --> 02:38:45,042
[SPEAKER_27]: EOSFBB says, taste like Muppet.

2692
02:38:48,524 --> 02:38:49,404
[SPEAKER_09]: Rock the cock.

2693
02:38:50,064 --> 02:38:51,905
[SPEAKER_27]: Alright, we did the erotic thing like an hour ago.

2694
02:38:51,985 --> 02:38:52,385
[SPEAKER_27]: Moving on.

2695
02:38:53,486 --> 02:38:56,487
[SPEAKER_19]: You know that candy cane still makes me think of that Jay and Silent Bob comic.

2696
02:38:56,827 --> 02:38:57,047
[SPEAKER_27]: What?

2697
02:38:57,107 --> 02:38:57,407
[SPEAKER_27]: What one?

2698
02:38:57,807 --> 02:39:03,189
[SPEAKER_19]: The one where Dante went to see Caitlyn in the asylum and started fucking her with a candy cane.

2699
02:39:03,589 --> 02:39:05,110
[SPEAKER_19]: And she woke up and chased him out.

2700
02:39:07,034 --> 02:39:10,937
[SPEAKER_27]: I need to watch the Clerks cartoon series again, just because it rules so much.

2701
02:39:11,838 --> 02:39:12,399
[SPEAKER_27]: Is it safe?

2702
02:39:14,080 --> 02:39:15,061
[SPEAKER_26]: It's very safe.

2703
02:39:16,642 --> 02:39:17,964
[SPEAKER_27]: Has anybody seen any- Let's see!

2704
02:39:20,966 --> 02:39:21,947
[SPEAKER_26]: Is it safe?

2705
02:39:23,348 --> 02:39:25,450
[SPEAKER_27]: Has there been any DDR on TV lately?

2706
02:39:26,311 --> 02:39:27,011
[SPEAKER_27]: Like on a show?

2707
02:39:27,212 --> 02:39:27,512
[SPEAKER_10]: No.

2708
02:39:27,712 --> 02:39:30,735
[SPEAKER_27]: Like I heard it was on Fastlane like three months ago, but that's such old news.

2709
02:39:31,175 --> 02:39:34,278
[SPEAKER_25]: They're gonna be airing a Slurpee Nation commercial on TV.

2710
02:39:35,604 --> 02:39:36,165
[SPEAKER_27]: On TV?

2711
02:39:37,305 --> 02:39:37,625
[SPEAKER_27]: Where?

2712
02:39:39,687 --> 02:39:42,849
[SPEAKER_27]: It's a commercial, but that doesn't mean it's a real commercial.

2713
02:39:43,889 --> 02:39:45,991
[SPEAKER_27]: It just seemed like a DDR ego thing.

2714
02:39:46,711 --> 02:39:49,193
[SPEAKER_27]: I thought that was just an online commercial.

2715
02:39:50,193 --> 02:39:51,895
[SPEAKER_27]: I don't think they're actually going to air it, no.

2716
02:39:52,535 --> 02:39:53,356
[SPEAKER_25]: Where would they air it?

2717
02:39:53,456 --> 02:39:54,076
[SPEAKER_25]: Assfucker?

2718
02:39:56,648 --> 02:40:03,373
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh my god though, I did download a cool, I mean it's an old commercial, but it was like the one of this Nike shoe that they're wearing in Japan.

2719
02:40:04,114 --> 02:40:04,594
[SPEAKER_19]: No, Nike.

2720
02:40:05,475 --> 02:40:11,479
[SPEAKER_19]: It's this guy walking past a gigantic shoe in front of a billboard, and all of a sudden the shoe transforms into a robot and flies off.

2721
02:40:12,360 --> 02:40:13,921
[SPEAKER_19]: And the guys are standing there going, blink.

2722
02:40:14,341 --> 02:40:16,223
[SPEAKER_19]: But they made a toy of that, like ten of them.

2723
02:40:17,484 --> 02:40:20,306
[SPEAKER_19]: And they were giving them to executives and had one in a giveaway prize, I want one.

2724
02:40:22,689 --> 02:40:25,211
[SPEAKER_23]: That was also in a magazine for, uh, Spin Magazine.

2725
02:40:25,251 --> 02:40:29,635
[SPEAKER_23]: It came with the little flipbook, and it had, like, had it turn into a football player, though.

2726
02:40:29,795 --> 02:40:30,836
[SPEAKER_23]: But it was pretty much the same thing.

2727
02:40:31,336 --> 02:40:32,698
[SPEAKER_23]: It also, like, turned into, like, a Gundam.

2728
02:40:34,419 --> 02:40:35,840
[SPEAKER_23]: That's what the football player looked like, though.

2729
02:40:36,221 --> 02:40:38,663
[SPEAKER_23]: And he, like, jumped up and flew away for no apparent reason.

2730
02:40:38,683 --> 02:40:43,747
[SPEAKER_19]: This guy's just standing there on the other side of the fence going, Well, what do you know?

2731
02:40:44,107 --> 02:40:44,888
[SPEAKER_19]: Shoot turned into a robot.

2732
02:40:45,706 --> 02:40:46,807
[SPEAKER_27]: Ask Orange Lounge

2733
02:41:12,566 --> 02:41:12,966
[SPEAKER_27]: Oh, okay.

2734
02:41:13,066 --> 02:41:13,867
[SPEAKER_27]: While you're waiting.

2735
02:41:13,887 --> 02:41:14,827
[SPEAKER_27]: All right, all right, fine.

2736
02:41:14,847 --> 02:41:15,547
[SPEAKER_13]: I think it's in there still.

2737
02:41:15,567 --> 02:41:16,228
[SPEAKER_13]: Is it already in there?

2738
02:41:16,288 --> 02:41:16,648
[SPEAKER_27]: All right.

2739
02:41:16,868 --> 02:41:18,769
[SPEAKER_27]: So send us those questions to me in the chat room.

2740
02:41:18,789 --> 02:41:27,172
[SPEAKER_27]: You can ask Orange Lounge, or you can ask Zero, you can ask Jonas, or alternatively, you can ask Brad and Irene out in the front room.

2741
02:41:27,192 --> 02:41:27,912
[SPEAKER_27]: You can ask any of us.

2742
02:41:27,932 --> 02:41:28,813
[SPEAKER_26]: Actually, I have a better song.

2743
02:41:28,953 --> 02:41:30,113
[SPEAKER_27]: Or Puppy, or Ryan.

2744
02:41:30,733 --> 02:41:31,634
[SPEAKER_26]: The Fly isn't that good.

2745
02:41:31,834 --> 02:41:34,875
[SPEAKER_26]: We can play, I've got Gennaro in there that's really good.

2746
02:41:35,095 --> 02:41:35,575
[SPEAKER_26]: Okay.

2747
02:41:35,616 --> 02:41:38,157
[SPEAKER_26]: That was going to be my Cage Match song, but it's nine minutes long.

2748
02:41:38,177 --> 02:41:38,577
[SPEAKER_26]: Well, you know what?

2749
02:41:38,617 --> 02:41:40,578
[SPEAKER_27]: No, we're doing our Journey to the Wonderland song, so that's what we always do.

2750
02:41:40,598 --> 02:41:41,378
[SPEAKER_26]: All right, fine.

2751
02:41:43,467 --> 02:41:44,548
[SPEAKER_27]: Alright, so ask Orange Lounge.

2752
02:41:44,568 --> 02:41:45,729
[SPEAKER_27]: Send me those questions in the chat room.

2753
02:41:47,891 --> 02:41:50,453
[SPEAKER_27]: You can ask Orange Lounge or you can ask any of our guests.

2754
02:41:51,474 --> 02:41:51,875
[SPEAKER_27]: Here we go.

2755
02:41:55,338 --> 02:41:56,319
[SPEAKER_27]: Really?

2756
02:41:57,720 --> 02:41:58,981
[SPEAKER_27]: Why am I so fly?

2757
02:42:00,082 --> 02:42:01,143
[SPEAKER_27]: Why am I so sexy?

2758
02:42:01,223 --> 02:42:01,964
[SPEAKER_27]: Is that why you're asking?

2759
02:42:02,024 --> 02:42:02,585
[SPEAKER_19]: Alright, well let's...

2760
02:42:08,488 --> 02:42:10,089
[SPEAKER_19]: Why are you so fly for a white guy?

2761
02:42:10,729 --> 02:42:11,929
[SPEAKER_27]: My last name is white man.

2762
02:42:12,149 --> 02:42:13,250
[SPEAKER_27]: Okay, first question.

2763
02:42:13,630 --> 02:42:17,231
[SPEAKER_27]: And people, don't send me your questions over slash notice.

2764
02:42:17,291 --> 02:42:20,132
[SPEAKER_27]: It's got to come over slash MSG because I might miss them.

2765
02:42:20,412 --> 02:42:22,613
[SPEAKER_27]: But I caught this one, so we'll start with this question.

2766
02:42:22,993 --> 02:42:29,275
[SPEAKER_27]: SoCalKicks wants to know, Can SoCalKicks be a special super duper derpity derp host at CBN?

2767
02:42:31,575 --> 02:42:33,676
[SPEAKER_19]: He can be our local chorus watcher.

2768
02:42:33,716 --> 02:42:34,817
[SPEAKER_27]: I don't see why not.

2769
02:42:34,857 --> 02:42:35,537
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah, he can be the local...

2770
02:42:37,119 --> 02:42:38,180
[SPEAKER_27]: This is what I'm thinking.

2771
02:42:38,700 --> 02:42:46,884
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm thinking since there's going to be so much to talk about, so many different people to talk about Cyber Beat Nation, to maybe make it its own... We could be an intern.

2772
02:42:46,904 --> 02:42:50,386
[SPEAKER_27]: Well, I'm thinking of having the Cyber Beat Nation interview be like its own show.

2773
02:42:50,526 --> 02:42:52,967
[SPEAKER_27]: Like, not normally, not a normal Sunday at 6.30.

2774
02:42:53,007 --> 02:43:00,991
[SPEAKER_19]: By the way, because we said we would, before I forget, we do have to introduce Black Lab as our foreign correspondent for the People's Republic of Davis.

2775
02:43:01,391 --> 02:43:02,072
[SPEAKER_27]: Oh, yes, good.

2776
02:43:02,932 --> 02:43:06,014
[SPEAKER_27]: Is there any news to report from the People's Republic of Davis foreign correspondent?

2777
02:43:06,414 --> 02:43:06,494
[SPEAKER_27]: Um...

2778
02:43:07,711 --> 02:43:09,192
[SPEAKER_24]: It's still as boring as ever.

2779
02:43:09,212 --> 02:43:10,153
[SPEAKER_27]: Uh-huh.

2780
02:43:10,634 --> 02:43:12,515
[SPEAKER_27]: Um... I heard you almost got run over by a cop.

2781
02:43:12,816 --> 02:43:13,556
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah.

2782
02:43:13,676 --> 02:43:15,198
[SPEAKER_24]: Damn cops.

2783
02:43:15,618 --> 02:43:15,918
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah.

2784
02:43:16,639 --> 02:43:17,560
[SPEAKER_24]: It's all a conspiracy.

2785
02:43:17,700 --> 02:43:19,101
[SPEAKER_24]: See, they're trying to take me out.

2786
02:43:20,322 --> 02:43:25,507
[SPEAKER_24]: It's because, um... A couple days ago when I was going out late, and I had to go to the A.M.

2787
02:43:25,527 --> 02:43:25,727
[SPEAKER_24]: P.M.

2788
02:43:25,747 --> 02:43:26,227
[SPEAKER_24]: to get food.

2789
02:43:26,287 --> 02:43:28,749
[SPEAKER_24]: Because the damn dining hall was closed early.

2790
02:43:28,769 --> 02:43:28,809
[SPEAKER_24]: Um...

2791
02:43:31,331 --> 02:43:40,816
[SPEAKER_24]: I was leaving on my bike, and three cop cars come screeching into the gas station parking lot with no lights or sirens on, and one of them almost hit me.

2792
02:43:42,036 --> 02:43:43,257
[SPEAKER_24]: And, yeah, things suck.

2793
02:43:46,481 --> 02:43:49,825
[SPEAKER_19]: Remember, it's the People's Republic of Davis where they'll find you for reading.

2794
02:43:51,066 --> 02:43:52,367
[SPEAKER_27]: This is CBN.

2795
02:43:53,428 --> 02:44:02,538
[SPEAKER_27]: What I'm thinking, and I need to know what the other hosts think of this, instead of airing the interviews during a show, maybe have it be its own special that airs Friday night or something.

2796
02:44:03,198 --> 02:44:03,879
[SPEAKER_13]: Sure, why not?

2797
02:44:04,019 --> 02:44:04,399
[SPEAKER_27]: Why not?

2798
02:44:04,499 --> 02:44:06,820
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm thinking of doing like a reality radio thing.

2799
02:44:06,860 --> 02:44:08,320
[SPEAKER_27]: Like actually doing a journal.

2800
02:44:08,660 --> 02:44:10,701
[SPEAKER_27]: Like saying, hey, it's Friday morning and we're leaving.

2801
02:44:10,881 --> 02:44:14,562
[SPEAKER_27]: Because I'm going down there with Mel B, and he's always a colorful character to have on the show.

2802
02:44:14,802 --> 02:44:16,582
[SPEAKER_27]: Brad and Irene might possibly tag along.

2803
02:44:16,622 --> 02:44:21,144
[SPEAKER_27]: We all know Brad's funnier than hell, and Irene will probably be playing Animal Crossing, so she won't say anything anyway.

2804
02:44:21,984 --> 02:44:22,744
[SPEAKER_27]: But I'm thinking about doing that.

2805
02:44:23,044 --> 02:44:25,425
[SPEAKER_26]: I wish I could go, but I'm having an empty house the whole weekend.

2806
02:44:25,825 --> 02:44:30,306
[SPEAKER_27]: So yes, SoCalKicks, you can be some kind of special, super-duper correspondent there.

2807
02:44:32,134 --> 02:44:34,077
[SPEAKER_19]: and in the background we'll have the Atari 5200 going.

2808
02:44:34,137 --> 02:44:34,357
[SPEAKER_19]: Alright.

2809
02:44:34,378 --> 02:44:38,804
[SPEAKER_19]: But I have one of those too and I do have combat.

2810
02:44:43,030 --> 02:44:50,136
[SPEAKER_27]: EOSFBB wants to know when will Orange Lounge have the next match game?

2811
02:44:50,156 --> 02:44:51,677
[SPEAKER_19]: We were going to do one tonight.

2812
02:45:04,208 --> 02:45:08,152
[SPEAKER_27]: But everything else ran too long because we had the Milpitas interviews and the fuck yous went on forever.

2813
02:45:08,313 --> 02:45:10,635
[SPEAKER_27]: So we'll try and get to one next week.

2814
02:45:10,855 --> 02:45:11,135
[SPEAKER_27]: Okay?

2815
02:45:11,356 --> 02:45:11,976
[SPEAKER_27]: We'll do one next week.

2816
02:45:11,996 --> 02:45:12,957
[SPEAKER_27]: We'll do one next week for you.

2817
02:45:13,238 --> 02:45:13,758
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll show.

2818
02:45:14,799 --> 02:45:15,120
[SPEAKER_27]: All right.

2819
02:45:15,240 --> 02:45:21,066
[SPEAKER_27]: Snub Dishnoid wants to know, how would one go about passing Rhythm and Patty?

2820
02:45:22,707 --> 02:45:23,408
[SPEAKER_26]: Oh, is that an edit?

2821
02:45:23,468 --> 02:45:24,269
[SPEAKER_27]: Oh, that's the edit.

2822
02:45:24,449 --> 02:45:25,470
[SPEAKER_27]: Loki, tell us about this.

2823
02:45:26,531 --> 02:45:32,918
[SPEAKER_26]: Rhythm and Patty, or R and Patty, was Orange Beanie's third place winner, I believe.

2824
02:45:34,479 --> 02:45:35,901
[SPEAKER_26]: Third place for the Hell edits.

2825
02:45:36,161 --> 02:45:40,505
[SPEAKER_26]: If you want to try passing it, play it in the first stage, and play your first stage on Beginner.

2826
02:45:40,565 --> 02:45:42,688
[SPEAKER_26]: You cannot fail Beginner, the first stage.

2827
02:45:43,348 --> 02:45:51,610
[SPEAKER_26]: So just play the edit, make sure it's set to beginner mode, and you can try it as many times as you want on the first stage, and you can't fail it.

2828
02:45:51,990 --> 02:45:57,452
[SPEAKER_26]: But he did it, and I was surprised, like holy shit, he like got an A on it or something.

2829
02:45:58,032 --> 02:46:00,313
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah, so it's a lot of stamina, but that's about it.

2830
02:46:01,973 --> 02:46:12,718
[SPEAKER_19]: I still think the one for Era was cooler, because it followed the 2DX steps, well, whatever, the rhythm of the keys.

2831
02:46:12,778 --> 02:46:16,120
[SPEAKER_19]: I was like, I heard it, and I was like, oh my god, it's 2DX.

2832
02:46:16,300 --> 02:46:22,122
[SPEAKER_26]: Well, what won it over the other ones was the crowd reaction for it, because, you know, everyone was around like, oh, that's so cool.

2833
02:46:22,282 --> 02:46:23,183
[SPEAKER_13]: So, yeah, it's cool.

2834
02:46:23,823 --> 02:46:25,083
[SPEAKER_27]: Alright, moving on, next question?

2835
02:46:25,623 --> 02:46:29,064
[SPEAKER_27]: Alright, next question, this one comes from Jahi, Jay Kinetic, our buddy.

2836
02:46:29,544 --> 02:46:32,745
[SPEAKER_27]: Jay Kinetic wants to know, when did Rob first get laid and how was it?

2837
02:46:33,285 --> 02:46:36,846
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, we did pass your virginity on the way to SoCal.

2838
02:46:36,866 --> 02:46:42,167
[SPEAKER_27]: Yes, for those that don't know, my virginity is actually two exits before Milpitas Golf Land.

2839
02:46:43,987 --> 02:46:46,108
[SPEAKER_27]: And this is really ironic, no, this is really ironic.

2840
02:46:46,855 --> 02:46:49,997
[SPEAKER_27]: I've lost my virginity the same weekend I saw DDR for the first time.

2841
02:46:50,398 --> 02:46:51,598
[SPEAKER_27]: Like, many years ago.

2842
02:46:51,879 --> 02:46:53,460
[SPEAKER_27]: Like, it was 1.5 minutes.

2843
02:46:53,480 --> 02:46:54,641
[SPEAKER_27]: Like a long... Like two.

2844
02:46:55,001 --> 02:46:55,281
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah.

2845
02:46:55,761 --> 02:46:57,382
[SPEAKER_27]: So, uh, and how was it?

2846
02:46:58,123 --> 02:47:00,845
[SPEAKER_27]: Uh, sorry to say, I've had much better since.

2847
02:47:02,326 --> 02:47:05,668
[SPEAKER_27]: So, you all can wave when you're past Mission Boulevard.

2848
02:47:05,688 --> 02:47:06,869
[SPEAKER_27]: There's a Motel 6 right there.

2849
02:47:06,889 --> 02:47:08,090
[SPEAKER_27]: Just wave at it.

2850
02:47:08,270 --> 02:47:08,470
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah.

2851
02:47:09,331 --> 02:47:10,712
[SPEAKER_27]: I can't believe I just said that on the radio.

2852
02:47:10,732 --> 02:47:11,873
[SPEAKER_27]: My mother's crying somewhere.

2853
02:47:11,953 --> 02:47:12,293
[SPEAKER_27]: Alright.

2854
02:47:13,634 --> 02:47:14,194
[SPEAKER_27]: Moving on.

2855
02:47:15,735 --> 02:47:16,336
[SPEAKER_27]: Jenny Bean.

2856
02:47:17,481 --> 02:47:27,248
[SPEAKER_27]: Can DCB and I be special non-Cyberbeat Nation interview hosts if we figure out how to record them for the people that don't know, that don't get to go to Cyberbeat Nation?

2857
02:47:27,288 --> 02:47:27,869
[SPEAKER_27]: Ha ha ha.

2858
02:47:29,090 --> 02:47:29,990
[SPEAKER_27]: Okay, sure, why not?

2859
02:47:30,491 --> 02:47:30,891
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay.

2860
02:47:31,031 --> 02:47:32,532
[SPEAKER_27]: Alright, you guys want to record something?

2861
02:47:32,572 --> 02:47:36,095
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm not going by choice because I have my 5th year anniversary and I'm going to.

2862
02:47:39,344 --> 02:47:41,627
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm just going to get laid.

2863
02:47:42,007 --> 02:47:51,257
[SPEAKER_26]: Anyways, yeah, gee, I wish I could be crammed into a nice small Korean arcade with tons of people there and it being all hot and stuff and crowded.

2864
02:47:53,560 --> 02:47:56,062
[SPEAKER_26]: Wait, no, that was... No, sorry, don't want to go.

2865
02:47:58,965 --> 02:48:03,050
[SPEAKER_26]: All right, so I wanted to go just to go to the Price is Right.

2866
02:48:03,110 --> 02:48:03,751
[SPEAKER_26]: God damn it.

2867
02:48:03,811 --> 02:48:05,853
[SPEAKER_26]: That's the only thing.

2868
02:48:06,093 --> 02:48:08,035
[SPEAKER_26]: I don't think Mel and I are going to have time to go to Price is Right.

2869
02:48:08,576 --> 02:48:08,816
[SPEAKER_26]: So...

2870
02:48:10,891 --> 02:48:11,731
[SPEAKER_27]: We have our Olivia back!

2871
02:48:11,751 --> 02:48:11,811
[SPEAKER_27]: Yay!

2872
02:48:11,851 --> 02:48:12,212
[SPEAKER_10]: Olivia's gone!

2873
02:48:12,252 --> 02:48:12,532
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm so happy.

2874
02:48:12,552 --> 02:48:16,493
[SPEAKER_27]: We have Olivia back and she's going to give me lots of stuff.

2875
02:48:39,289 --> 02:48:40,030
[SPEAKER_27]: We got Lee back.

2876
02:48:40,070 --> 02:48:40,651
[SPEAKER_19]: Yay!

2877
02:48:40,731 --> 02:48:41,231
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm so happy.

2878
02:48:41,251 --> 02:48:41,331
[SPEAKER_19]: Good.

2879
02:48:41,351 --> 02:48:42,292
[SPEAKER_19]: You can have the bitch.

2880
02:48:42,552 --> 02:48:42,913
[SPEAKER_27]: Alright.

2881
02:48:43,093 --> 02:48:43,393
[SPEAKER_27]: Wow.

2882
02:48:44,054 --> 02:48:44,294
[SPEAKER_27]: Wow.

2883
02:48:44,354 --> 02:48:45,596
[SPEAKER_27]: Happy day in Animal Crossing.

2884
02:48:45,756 --> 02:48:46,677
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, happy day.

2885
02:48:46,697 --> 02:48:48,018
[SPEAKER_19]: You can have that little chick back.

2886
02:48:48,058 --> 02:48:48,298
[SPEAKER_27]: Alright.

2887
02:48:48,338 --> 02:48:48,659
[SPEAKER_27]: Here we go.

2888
02:48:48,699 --> 02:48:49,099
[SPEAKER_27]: Moving on.

2889
02:48:49,680 --> 02:48:51,161
[SPEAKER_27]: Quit traveling between villagers.

2890
02:48:51,181 --> 02:48:53,844
[SPEAKER_27]: We're going to lose all of our villagers if you guys keep doing the traveling.

2891
02:48:53,884 --> 02:48:54,064
[SPEAKER_27]: Alright.

2892
02:48:54,545 --> 02:48:54,905
[SPEAKER_27]: Moving on.

2893
02:48:54,965 --> 02:48:55,266
[SPEAKER_27]: Shadow.

2894
02:48:57,208 --> 02:49:00,751
[SPEAKER_27]: Hey Loki, can we make you into one of those Virtu thingies for Step Mania?

2895
02:49:00,831 --> 02:49:03,953
[SPEAKER_27]: You and your burning hair jumping out from the left hand side of the screen.

2896
02:49:05,994 --> 02:49:06,635
[SPEAKER_26]: Oh, let me grow my hair.

2897
02:49:06,655 --> 02:49:07,235
[SPEAKER_26]: Yelling toasty.

2898
02:49:07,355 --> 02:49:11,058
[SPEAKER_26]: Well, let me grow out my hair a little bit longer so it's like really messed up and stuff.

2899
02:49:11,258 --> 02:49:16,082
[SPEAKER_26]: You can get me dressed up for like, um, cause in Phantom Man I'm gonna be cosplaying as Oolong the bunny.

2900
02:49:16,702 --> 02:49:23,707
[SPEAKER_26]: So, so, so you can get a picture of me with a pancake on my head and, uh, yeah, that'd be funny.

2901
02:49:24,708 --> 02:49:25,749
[SPEAKER_19]: I'll cosplay as Oolong too.

2902
02:49:27,734 --> 02:49:30,378
[SPEAKER_19]: Rob, do you mind if I cosplay with you?

2903
02:49:31,399 --> 02:49:32,721
[SPEAKER_26]: Go right ahead.

2904
02:49:32,741 --> 02:49:34,263
[SPEAKER_19]: We're going to cosplay as Ulan, and you know what?

2905
02:49:34,323 --> 02:49:37,628
[SPEAKER_19]: I found those old rabbit fur coats from the 80s.

2906
02:49:38,309 --> 02:49:41,393
[SPEAKER_19]: Since they're already dead and made into coats, we can just cut them up.

2907
02:49:41,854 --> 02:49:42,334
[SPEAKER_19]: That'd be cool.

2908
02:49:44,076 --> 02:49:44,676
[SPEAKER_27]: Oh my lord.

2909
02:49:44,776 --> 02:49:48,677
[SPEAKER_27]: Alright, Strong Brad wants to know, can we spot him for Cyber Beat Nation?

2910
02:49:49,318 --> 02:49:49,478
[SPEAKER_27]: No.

2911
02:49:49,858 --> 02:49:51,238
[SPEAKER_27]: Alright, moving on.

2912
02:49:52,459 --> 02:49:57,620
[SPEAKER_27]: Sorry, you know, we're poor enough, it's hard enough for me to get down there, Christ.

2913
02:49:58,240 --> 02:50:02,562
[SPEAKER_27]: VidPawa wants to know, how are your guys' PlayStation 2s modded, if they are modded at all?

2914
02:50:02,962 --> 02:50:06,123
[SPEAKER_27]: Also, if they are modded, did you do it yourself or did someone else do it for you?

2915
02:50:06,203 --> 02:50:06,523
[SPEAKER_19]: Pierre?

2916
02:50:07,342 --> 02:50:07,982
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm not cheap.

2917
02:50:08,342 --> 02:50:09,383
[SPEAKER_19]: I bought a JPS2.

2918
02:50:09,563 --> 02:50:11,064
[SPEAKER_27]: I also bought a JPS2.

2919
02:50:12,084 --> 02:50:16,186
[SPEAKER_26]: I attempted to mod mine with a plug mod that's internal.

2920
02:50:16,506 --> 02:50:22,868
[SPEAKER_26]: And ever since I tried doing that, every now and then it doesn't want to load my GameShark CD and I have to reboot it.

2921
02:50:22,968 --> 02:50:28,791
[SPEAKER_26]: But I have three plug mods that are supposedly going to work in some version of the PS2.

2922
02:50:28,911 --> 02:50:29,971
[SPEAKER_26]: I just don't have one.

2923
02:50:29,991 --> 02:50:31,172
[SPEAKER_26]: I need to get rid of them.

2924
02:50:31,972 --> 02:50:38,260
[SPEAKER_27]: The money you're going to spend attempting all those various mod chips, you might as well just crack and get the JPS2.

2925
02:50:38,360 --> 02:50:45,710
[SPEAKER_19]: Keep in mind this, is that for every mod that comes out, with every new game that comes out, it has protection.

2926
02:50:46,290 --> 02:50:49,655
[SPEAKER_19]: So, like, say that you want the next 2DX to come out, it ain't gonna work.

2927
02:50:50,572 --> 02:50:51,973
[SPEAKER_19]: Just, you know, save yourself some time.

2928
02:50:51,993 --> 02:50:53,935
[SPEAKER_19]: You can get a Japanese PlayStation 2 for cheap.

2929
02:50:54,135 --> 02:50:58,239
[SPEAKER_19]: And from what I understand, if anything ever happens to a network video, just serve a secret JPS2.

2930
02:50:59,179 --> 02:51:06,606
[SPEAKER_27]: Uh, word of advice, don't use mod chips on your PS2s because, exactly what Jamie said, Sony can fuck them up.

2931
02:51:06,726 --> 02:51:07,887
[SPEAKER_27]: I'll laugh at you.

2932
02:51:08,307 --> 02:51:15,053
[SPEAKER_27]: So, you know, maybe there'll be a super special secret one that'll get through someday, but honestly, just get the JPS2 and save yourself the headache.

2933
02:51:15,473 --> 02:51:18,316
[SPEAKER_19]: They're going to have one that works for everything after the system's already obsolete.

2934
02:51:18,336 --> 02:51:18,537
[SPEAKER_27]: Yep.

2935
02:51:18,557 --> 02:51:20,659
[SPEAKER_27]: Which it is, technically.

2936
02:51:21,260 --> 02:51:22,801
[SPEAKER_27]: Moving on to EOSFBB.

2937
02:51:22,942 --> 02:51:23,602
[SPEAKER_27]: Oh, dear God.

2938
02:51:23,622 --> 02:51:26,486
[SPEAKER_27]: He's giving us a website and asking us the impressions of the site.

2939
02:51:28,668 --> 02:51:32,532
[SPEAKER_27]: And I'm really scared whenever EOSFBB sends me a fucking website.

2940
02:51:32,552 --> 02:51:32,873
[SPEAKER_27]: All right.

2941
02:51:33,974 --> 02:51:35,496
[SPEAKER_27]: Kama Sutra Animated.

2942
02:51:35,516 --> 02:51:35,716
[SPEAKER_27]: Hmm.

2943
02:51:38,288 --> 02:51:38,708
[SPEAKER_27]: I will.

2944
02:51:40,429 --> 02:51:41,089
[SPEAKER_27]: Interesting.

2945
02:51:41,429 --> 02:51:42,970
[SPEAKER_27]: We'll look at it more in depth a little later.

2946
02:51:43,030 --> 02:51:45,030
[SPEAKER_27]: We've got a bunch more questions to get to.

2947
02:51:45,050 --> 02:51:48,351
[SPEAKER_27]: I like the animated picture of the right in the cock there.

2948
02:51:48,371 --> 02:51:49,332
[SPEAKER_27]: That's very interesting.

2949
02:51:49,612 --> 02:51:51,432
[SPEAKER_27]: That might be my new icon on TDR Free.

2950
02:51:51,472 --> 02:51:52,633
[SPEAKER_27]: What do you think?

2951
02:51:53,733 --> 02:51:54,173
[SPEAKER_27]: Oh, wait.

2952
02:51:54,253 --> 02:51:55,273
[SPEAKER_27]: I might get a point for that.

2953
02:51:55,394 --> 02:51:56,214
[SPEAKER_19]: It'd get removed.

2954
02:51:56,254 --> 02:51:57,674
[SPEAKER_19]: You'd have 24 hours to remove it.

2955
02:51:57,714 --> 02:51:58,034
[SPEAKER_27]: Damn it.

2956
02:51:58,775 --> 02:52:00,715
[SPEAKER_27]: Well, for that 24 hours, it would be hilarious.

2957
02:52:00,795 --> 02:52:01,015
[SPEAKER_27]: All right.

2958
02:52:01,576 --> 02:52:03,436
[SPEAKER_27]: Moving on.

2959
02:52:03,596 --> 02:52:06,037
[SPEAKER_27]: 23rd Magus, can we call you a boo-boo kitty fuck?

2960
02:52:07,077 --> 02:52:09,278
[SPEAKER_27]: If you were asking that question to Loki, sure.

2961
02:52:09,838 --> 02:52:13,900
[SPEAKER_26]: Actually, that's my backup name for when my name was taken or something.

2962
02:52:13,920 --> 02:52:14,800
[SPEAKER_26]: That's where it appears at.

2963
02:52:15,360 --> 02:52:20,462
[SPEAKER_19]: Actually, someone in the Fruits community's name is BooBooKittyFuck, the legend community.

2964
02:52:20,782 --> 02:52:23,263
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah, I remember seeing a name called BooBooKittyFuck.

2965
02:52:23,843 --> 02:52:24,124
[SPEAKER_27]: All right.

2966
02:52:25,124 --> 02:52:27,785
[SPEAKER_27]: DCB has a question, and it's, hi, guys.

2967
02:52:28,425 --> 02:52:28,565
Hi.

2968
02:52:29,426 --> 02:52:29,766
[SPEAKER_19]: Hi.

2969
02:52:32,079 --> 02:52:33,100
[SPEAKER_27]: This is the police.

2970
02:52:33,841 --> 02:52:36,724
[SPEAKER_27]: DCB, put the joke down.

2971
02:52:37,004 --> 02:52:38,606
[SPEAKER_27]: Step away from the joke.

2972
02:52:39,246 --> 02:52:40,928
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi Dad, I'm in jail.

2973
02:52:41,949 --> 02:52:43,030
[SPEAKER_27]: Alright, moving on.

2974
02:52:43,831 --> 02:52:47,035
[SPEAKER_27]: SoCalKicks wants to know, will you buy me a PlayStation 2 Japanese?

2975
02:52:47,215 --> 02:52:47,395
[SPEAKER_27]: No.

2976
02:52:47,615 --> 02:52:47,775
[SPEAKER_27]: No.

2977
02:52:48,456 --> 02:52:48,957
[SPEAKER_27]: Moving on.

2978
02:52:50,566 --> 02:52:54,168
[SPEAKER_27]: Damn it, the Matrix is 102 days away, it's 102 days too long.

2979
02:52:54,188 --> 02:53:01,431
[SPEAKER_27]: Alright, Jay Kinetic wants to know, Does anyone know where I can get Japanese hip-hop and R&B romanji lyrics?

2980
02:53:02,031 --> 02:53:05,673
[SPEAKER_27]: Where is the Lucifer pic that DarkSakura was supposed to send me, and who's hotter?

2981
02:53:06,698 --> 02:53:08,999
[SPEAKER_27]: Yoji Kudo or Irvine Kinase?

2982
02:53:09,299 --> 02:53:11,100
[SPEAKER_27]: I fucked that up because I'm too honky, sorry.

2983
02:53:11,280 --> 02:53:13,120
[SPEAKER_19]: Alright, here's what I have to say.

2984
02:53:13,621 --> 02:53:19,703
[SPEAKER_19]: As far as the lyrics, I had stuff, but I'll have to go find the sites again.

2985
02:53:20,183 --> 02:53:25,165
[SPEAKER_19]: As far as the pic of Lucifer, my hard drive was broken a few weeks ago.

2986
02:53:25,685 --> 02:53:28,206
[SPEAKER_19]: So that means that I have to find it for you again.

2987
02:53:29,066 --> 02:53:30,187
[SPEAKER_19]: But just look up Angel Sanctuary.

2988
02:53:30,207 --> 02:53:31,728
[SPEAKER_19]: There's actually a really good Japanese set.

2989
02:53:31,748 --> 02:53:33,470
[SPEAKER_19]: They've got tons of good Lucifer pictures.

2990
02:53:34,050 --> 02:53:37,012
[SPEAKER_19]: And as far as Yoji or Irvine... Irvine, dude!

2991
02:53:37,352 --> 02:53:45,058
[SPEAKER_19]: Just the hair, the trench coat, the shotgun hat... The only redeeming quality of playing Final Fantasy VIII.

2992
02:53:45,098 --> 02:53:45,679
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah, I agree.

2993
02:53:45,999 --> 02:53:49,301
[SPEAKER_27]: Irvine's hotter, because that was the only redeeming quality of Final Fantasy VIII.

2994
02:53:49,321 --> 02:53:53,725
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, Squall was pretty hot, even though he had the personality of a pancake.

2995
02:53:53,745 --> 02:53:55,366
[SPEAKER_27]: Squall was a panty, okay!

2996
02:53:56,818 --> 02:54:01,101
[SPEAKER_27]: Oh, DCB claims that I love Derby Owners Club more than I love us.

2997
02:54:01,521 --> 02:54:04,703
[SPEAKER_27]: Meaning Orange Lounge, I suppose, or more than the Killer Pals or something like that.

2998
02:54:05,464 --> 02:54:09,086
[SPEAKER_27]: To be truthful, yes, I do love Derby Owners Club more than any of you.

2999
02:54:09,527 --> 02:54:10,848
[SPEAKER_27]: Sorry, it's just the way it is.

3000
02:54:11,208 --> 02:54:11,868
[SPEAKER_27]: No, I'm kidding.

3001
02:54:12,469 --> 02:54:13,029
[SPEAKER_27]: Nice question.

3002
02:54:13,069 --> 02:54:13,669
[SPEAKER_27]: It's just a game.

3003
02:54:13,970 --> 02:54:16,071
[SPEAKER_27]: Sure, I spent 20 bucks on it the other day, but hey, you know.

3004
02:54:16,091 --> 02:54:18,633
[SPEAKER_26]: Why can't they have Hookers Owners Club, okay?

3005
02:54:18,693 --> 02:54:22,015
[SPEAKER_26]: I want to be a pimp and be able to raise my hookers to be the best prostitutes in the world.

3006
02:54:22,335 --> 02:54:23,256
[SPEAKER_26]: Why can't they have that?

3007
02:54:24,116 --> 02:54:26,018
[SPEAKER_26]: I could totally see that if it would be this golf land.

3008
02:54:30,999 --> 02:54:32,140
[SPEAKER_27]: Ah, good question.

3009
02:54:32,780 --> 02:54:38,162
[SPEAKER_27]: Angel is asking this, but he says it's actually Jay Kinetic's question that I liked, but he didn't send it over PM.

3010
02:54:38,742 --> 02:54:42,283
[SPEAKER_27]: What's everyone's favorite sushi among the Orange Lounge Radio staff?

3011
02:54:42,603 --> 02:54:43,944
[SPEAKER_19]: Gold or nigiri.

3012
02:54:44,924 --> 02:54:45,164
[SPEAKER_27]: Either.

3013
02:54:46,249 --> 02:55:03,356
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay, for rolls, my favorite roll would have to be, at this point, the twin dragon roll at Shia, which is like six types of fish wrapped around, of course, the rice, the nori, and fried lobster tail with this really yummy sauce.

3014
02:55:03,436 --> 02:55:10,319
[SPEAKER_19]: And then my favorite nigiri roll is, at this time, I would have to say toro, which is patty tuna.

3015
02:55:11,974 --> 02:55:12,875
[SPEAKER_26]: I like toast.

3016
02:55:15,836 --> 02:55:16,997
[SPEAKER_26]: No, I don't like sushi at all.

3017
02:55:17,217 --> 02:55:20,579
[SPEAKER_26]: I've never tried it, but, you know, me being a picky eater, I don't like sushi.

3018
02:55:20,659 --> 02:55:23,140
[SPEAKER_26]: It just doesn't look good to me.

3019
02:55:23,160 --> 02:55:23,700
[SPEAKER_27]: Sorry to hear that.

3020
02:55:24,541 --> 02:55:27,422
[SPEAKER_27]: Alright, we're going to take the last few questions here.

3021
02:55:28,003 --> 02:55:28,803
[SPEAKER_27]: Oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

3022
02:55:28,823 --> 02:55:29,683
[SPEAKER_27]: What's your favorite roll?

3023
02:55:29,743 --> 02:55:34,006
[SPEAKER_27]: My favorite roll is Sacramento rolls, deep fried California rolls, because they're fattening and good.

3024
02:55:34,026 --> 02:55:34,846
[SPEAKER_27]: What's your favorite single roll?

3025
02:55:35,386 --> 02:55:36,167
[SPEAKER_27]: Favorite single roll?

3026
02:55:36,467 --> 02:55:38,108
[SPEAKER_19]: Have you had any before, like a nagi taco roll?

3027
02:55:38,971 --> 02:55:40,754
[SPEAKER_27]: Like the sashimi?

3028
02:55:43,497 --> 02:55:46,681
[SPEAKER_27]: Um, I'd say unagi.

3029
02:55:46,842 --> 02:55:48,023
[SPEAKER_19]: Rob likes the eel.

3030
02:55:48,163 --> 02:55:48,744
[SPEAKER_27]: I do like the eel.

3031
02:55:48,784 --> 02:55:49,405
[SPEAKER_19]: It's long.

3032
02:55:49,886 --> 02:55:52,369
[SPEAKER_27]: Alright, we're closing the question asking now.

3033
02:55:52,389 --> 02:55:53,931
[SPEAKER_27]: We're going to take the last few questions here.

3034
02:55:59,474 --> 02:55:59,955
[SPEAKER_27]: Ooh, dead air.

3035
02:56:00,115 --> 02:56:00,615
[SPEAKER_27]: Sorry about that.

3036
02:56:00,635 --> 02:56:02,797
[SPEAKER_27]: Alright, last question.

3037
02:56:03,458 --> 02:56:05,440
[SPEAKER_27]: Aw, dammit, it's another will you buy me question.

3038
02:56:05,680 --> 02:56:08,863
[SPEAKER_27]: RYC3 wants to know, will you buy me a Universal PS2?

3039
02:56:09,484 --> 02:56:10,685
[SPEAKER_27]: No, there's no such thing.

3040
02:56:11,206 --> 02:56:11,526
[SPEAKER_27]: Alright.

3041
02:56:13,268 --> 02:56:13,728
[SPEAKER_27]: That's it.

3042
02:56:15,830 --> 02:56:18,793
[SPEAKER_27]: No more questions, although I want to put in this website that DCB just posted.

3043
02:56:18,833 --> 02:56:19,854
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm kind of scared of it, though.

3044
02:56:22,542 --> 02:56:24,186
[SPEAKER_27]: Columbia, the shuttle tragedy.

3045
02:56:25,189 --> 02:56:26,733
[SPEAKER_27]: It's a screencap from CNN.

3046
02:56:26,793 --> 02:56:30,062
[SPEAKER_27]: It says, shuttle traveling nearly 18 times speed of light.

3047
02:56:33,479 --> 02:56:39,421
[SPEAKER_19]: Do the salt and pepper shakers on Blue's Clues actually hold cocaine and heroin?

3048
02:56:54,148 --> 02:56:56,070
[SPEAKER_27]: That's a total inside joke from Friday, yes.

3049
02:56:56,971 --> 02:57:01,915
[SPEAKER_19]: I want to watch Buffy.

3050
02:57:03,076 --> 02:57:05,117
[SPEAKER_27]: DarkTetsuya wants to know a good place to pick up girls.

3051
02:57:06,779 --> 02:57:07,179
[SPEAKER_19]: Online.

3052
02:57:07,299 --> 02:57:07,640
[SPEAKER_19]: Online.

3053
02:57:10,290 --> 02:57:20,158
[SPEAKER_27]: and last question, last question there are no girls online, they're all 40 year old men last question, SoCalKicks wants to know do you think Ali Larder would be a good Samus for the Metroid movie?

3054
02:57:21,439 --> 02:57:24,622
[SPEAKER_27]: that chick from Final Destination what movie was that?

3055
02:57:24,762 --> 02:57:29,286
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't watch that movie I didn't even hear of Final Destination was she in Bring It On?

3056
02:57:29,306 --> 02:57:31,888
[SPEAKER_27]: no she wasn't in Bring It On what other movie was she in?

3057
02:57:33,109 --> 02:57:37,973
[SPEAKER_19]: there was another big I watched movies that don't suck Final Destination wasn't that bad

3058
02:57:40,231 --> 02:57:41,231
[SPEAKER_27]: What else was she in?

3059
02:57:42,312 --> 02:57:43,432
[SPEAKER_27]: Would she be good, Samus?

3060
02:57:43,712 --> 02:57:44,593
[SPEAKER_27]: Eh, she'd be okay.

3061
02:57:44,633 --> 02:57:48,454
[SPEAKER_27]: It would be better than fucking Angelina Jolie or Mira.

3062
02:57:48,654 --> 02:57:52,075
[SPEAKER_27]: Just fucking... We need to get away from those people.

3063
02:57:54,456 --> 02:57:55,276
[SPEAKER_27]: Oh, thank you.

3064
02:57:55,336 --> 02:57:57,217
[SPEAKER_27]: Okay, Allie Larder wasn't Jay and Silent Bob.

3065
02:57:57,537 --> 02:57:58,677
[SPEAKER_27]: She was the chick that farted.

3066
02:57:59,678 --> 02:58:00,918
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh!

3067
02:58:01,038 --> 02:58:04,859
[SPEAKER_19]: No, no, she's too... You know who?

3068
02:58:05,400 --> 02:58:05,760
[SPEAKER_19]: They need...

3069
02:58:08,286 --> 02:58:08,807
[SPEAKER_19]: No, no, no.

3070
02:58:09,247 --> 02:58:10,869
[SPEAKER_19]: First of all, Samus has green hair.

3071
02:58:12,751 --> 02:58:14,933
[SPEAKER_27]: They're going to be making a Metroid movie, yes.

3072
02:58:15,253 --> 02:58:18,636
[SPEAKER_19]: Samus needs to be a freaking powerful looking woman.

3073
02:58:18,657 --> 02:58:21,139
[SPEAKER_19]: Samus is supposed to be like seven feet tall.

3074
02:58:21,179 --> 02:58:21,559
[SPEAKER_19]: China.

3075
02:58:22,661 --> 02:58:26,344
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm wondering why... Dude, China would be a fucking kick-ass Samus.

3076
02:58:28,286 --> 02:58:29,047
[SPEAKER_27]: Lucy Lawless.

3077
02:58:29,107 --> 02:58:29,407
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah.

3078
02:58:30,968 --> 02:58:33,069
[SPEAKER_27]: or the chick that played Gabrielle.

3079
02:58:33,109 --> 02:58:36,650
[SPEAKER_27]: I want my Samus to have lesbian connotations, Samus.

3080
02:58:37,610 --> 02:58:42,412
[SPEAKER_26]: No, I was wondering why... I mean, I've seen a lot of really shitty-ass movies.

3081
02:58:42,452 --> 02:58:47,993
[SPEAKER_26]: I mean, for instance, I've given out some of those for the... Black Ninja, okay?

3082
02:58:48,353 --> 02:58:49,494
[SPEAKER_26]: Really shitty-ass movies.

3083
02:58:49,634 --> 02:58:51,194
[SPEAKER_26]: Why hasn't the DDR movie come out?

3084
02:58:51,214 --> 02:58:54,355
[SPEAKER_26]: I mean, even some really cheap-ass studio could pick this stuff up.

3085
02:58:54,495 --> 02:58:55,636
[SPEAKER_26]: I mean, for next to nothing.

3086
02:58:56,916 --> 02:59:06,923
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm just surprised that it hasn't been, like, released.

3087
02:59:07,143 --> 02:59:10,625
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm still voting for Lucy Lawless to be Samus.

3088
02:59:11,365 --> 02:59:13,147
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah, Lucy Lawless would kick ass.

3089
02:59:13,527 --> 02:59:18,250
[SPEAKER_27]: And SoCalKicks is stomping and pouting because he said he saw the end of Metroid Prime and she's a blonde.

3090
02:59:19,409 --> 02:59:26,796
[SPEAKER_19]: Um, actually, so in Super Metroid, but I'm referring to the first Metroid, if you put in the code, Justin Bailey, Samus has green hair.

3091
02:59:27,356 --> 02:59:28,277
[SPEAKER_27]: So, eh.

3092
02:59:28,718 --> 02:59:31,761
[SPEAKER_19]: And, you know, Justin Bailey is not actually a name.

3093
02:59:32,221 --> 02:59:34,383
[SPEAKER_19]: It's actually referring to just wearing underwear.

3094
02:59:35,244 --> 02:59:35,864
[SPEAKER_19]: Woo!

3095
02:59:35,964 --> 02:59:36,565
[SPEAKER_19]: It's an Australian.

3096
02:59:36,825 --> 02:59:37,005
[SPEAKER_19]: Ow!

3097
02:59:37,386 --> 02:59:41,309
[SPEAKER_19]: Because Bailey is a piece.

3098
02:59:41,710 --> 02:59:43,251
[SPEAKER_19]: So that's where it came from, Justin Bailey.

3099
02:59:45,621 --> 02:59:47,722
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes, I'm full of old video game knowledge.

3100
02:59:47,962 --> 02:59:48,382
[SPEAKER_19]: Sue me.

3101
02:59:48,742 --> 02:59:50,603
[SPEAKER_19]: I have to go through my list, but no one cares.

3102
02:59:51,063 --> 02:59:51,343
[SPEAKER_27]: Hurry up.

3103
02:59:51,363 --> 02:59:52,083
[SPEAKER_27]: Go through your list.

3104
02:59:52,243 --> 02:59:52,463
[SPEAKER_27]: Do it.

3105
02:59:52,684 --> 02:59:53,624
[SPEAKER_19]: It would take me a long time.

3106
02:59:54,004 --> 02:59:54,964
[SPEAKER_27]: You want to save it for next week, then?

3107
02:59:55,444 --> 02:59:56,245
[SPEAKER_19]: I'll go through the list.

3108
02:59:56,265 --> 02:59:57,325
[SPEAKER_19]: Who wants to know what I have?

3109
02:59:57,745 --> 02:59:58,045
[SPEAKER_27]: Do it.

3110
02:59:58,565 --> 02:59:58,865

03:01:33,050 --> 03:01:34,490
[SPEAKER_19]: Um, think about TurboDuo, it's awesome.

3143
03:01:35,191 --> 03:01:40,192
[SPEAKER_19]: As long as you use good quality CDs, you can play a game no matter, you can copy games on them, no matter the country code.

3144
03:01:40,432 --> 03:01:42,432
[SPEAKER_19]: Because there's no country lockout, no copy lockout.

3145
03:01:42,873 --> 03:01:45,833
[SPEAKER_19]: So, I had, let's play Dracula, I actually have Dracula X now in original.

3146
03:01:46,854 --> 03:01:49,734
[SPEAKER_19]: Um, I have, um, a Nintendo 64.

3147
03:01:50,674 --> 03:01:50,955
[SPEAKER_19]: Somewhere.

3148
03:01:52,175 --> 03:01:53,115
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't know what I did with it.

3149
03:01:53,255 --> 03:01:54,235
[SPEAKER_19]: I think it's paperweight somewhere.

3150
03:01:54,255 --> 03:01:54,916
[SPEAKER_19]: I have an Xbox.

3151
03:01:55,756 --> 03:01:56,416
[SPEAKER_19]: I have a GameCube.

3152
03:01:57,316 --> 03:01:58,777
[SPEAKER_19]: Um, no, I didn't melt it.

3153
03:01:59,077 --> 03:02:00,377
[SPEAKER_19]: I have a Dreamcast, I have two Dreamcasts.

3154
03:02:01,529 --> 03:02:04,130
[SPEAKER_19]: Um, two PlayStation 2s.

3155
03:02:05,010 --> 03:02:08,991
[SPEAKER_19]: I've got a stack of old-style PlayStations, including the first model.

3156
03:02:09,652 --> 03:02:10,812
[SPEAKER_19]: I have a PS1.

3157
03:02:11,912 --> 03:02:13,073
[SPEAKER_19]: I have, what else did you name?

3158
03:02:13,093 --> 03:02:14,913
[SPEAKER_19]: I have an Xbox.

3159
03:02:15,833 --> 03:02:22,315
[SPEAKER_19]: Um, I have, I do not have a 3DO, but we almost bought a CD-i right before Game Masters went out of business.

3160
03:02:23,596 --> 03:02:26,217
[SPEAKER_19]: Um, I have a Kinectrix.

3161
03:02:26,437 --> 03:02:27,237
[SPEAKER_19]: We're looking for a Vectrex.

3162
03:02:29,836 --> 03:02:30,776
[SPEAKER_19]: Um, Mattel?

3163
03:02:30,836 --> 03:02:31,657
[SPEAKER_19]: Which one did Mattel do?

3164
03:02:31,677 --> 03:02:35,578
[SPEAKER_27]: Wasn't that the Intellivision?

3165
03:02:35,598 --> 03:02:36,398
[SPEAKER_19]: I almost bought a Pico.

3166
03:02:36,418 --> 03:02:37,599
[SPEAKER_19]: I thought that was the Intellivision.

3167
03:02:37,619 --> 03:02:38,259
[SPEAKER_19]: The Sega Pico?

3168
03:02:39,479 --> 03:02:41,700
[SPEAKER_19]: Because they were selling it for 10 bucks when I was at Mobile.

3169
03:02:43,761 --> 03:02:46,642
[SPEAKER_19]: Um, I have a Neo Geo cartridge system.

3170
03:02:47,322 --> 03:02:48,202
[SPEAKER_19]: I have a Neo Geo CD.

3171
03:02:50,183 --> 03:02:51,163
[SPEAKER_19]: You know how Dan got that?

3172
03:02:51,303 --> 03:02:55,465
[SPEAKER_19]: Dan got our Neo card by trading a Sega CD for it.

3173
03:02:57,734 --> 03:02:59,876
[SPEAKER_19]: Back then, they didn't know, because of the thing.

3174
03:03:00,357 --> 03:03:05,182
[SPEAKER_19]: And we actually are still picking up our cartridges, plus we picked up this KOF 2000.

3175
03:03:05,222 --> 03:03:05,823
[SPEAKER_19]: How much was that?

3176
03:03:06,684 --> 03:03:07,825
[SPEAKER_19]: We got it for just over $300.

3177
03:03:07,865 --> 03:03:12,190
[SPEAKER_19]: What else do I have?

3178
03:03:12,851 --> 03:03:14,012
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh yeah, I have a Wonderswan color.

3179
03:03:14,973 --> 03:03:17,356
[SPEAKER_19]: We have two Neo Geo Pocket colors and a Neo Geo Pocket.

3180
03:03:18,837 --> 03:03:24,361
[SPEAKER_19]: and, um, I might have exhausted the list if there's anything else I don't remember because I know I've got other stuff.

3181
03:03:24,781 --> 03:03:25,241
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay.

3182
03:03:25,661 --> 03:03:27,622
[SPEAKER_27]: So... Wow, you own a lot.

3183
03:03:27,662 --> 03:03:28,903
[SPEAKER_19]: That's like 40-something, I think.

3184
03:03:29,744 --> 03:03:30,284
[SPEAKER_27]: Disgusting!

3185
03:03:30,884 --> 03:03:31,104
[SPEAKER_27]: Oh well.

3186
03:03:31,905 --> 03:03:32,265
[SPEAKER_27]: But fun.

3187
03:03:32,565 --> 03:03:34,226
[SPEAKER_27]: Your house is a video game museum, it really is.

3188
03:03:34,907 --> 03:03:38,749
[SPEAKER_19]: And don't forget the Transformers and Valkyries that are littering my house.

3189
03:03:41,539 --> 03:03:42,179
[SPEAKER_26]: Seriously.

3190
03:03:42,860 --> 03:03:47,566
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm afraid because the movie pile that I have in my house is starting to creep towards my bed, and I think it's coming after me.

3191
03:03:47,726 --> 03:03:48,007
[SPEAKER_27]: Yikes.

3192
03:03:48,768 --> 03:03:49,589
[SPEAKER_27]: Okay, we've got to wrap this show.

3193
03:03:49,609 --> 03:03:50,870
[SPEAKER_27]: We're already running like five minutes late.

3194
03:03:51,391 --> 03:03:52,693
[SPEAKER_27]: Any final thoughts from you folks?

3195
03:03:52,993 --> 03:03:53,474
[SPEAKER_19]: I want Boba.

3196
03:03:54,295 --> 03:03:54,915
[SPEAKER_27]: Jamie wants Boba.

3197
03:03:55,751 --> 03:03:56,211
[SPEAKER_27]: You know what, though?

3198
03:03:56,291 --> 03:03:59,872
[SPEAKER_27]: I've got to get back here, like, fast, so if we go get Bubba, we just have to go get Bubba and go.

3199
03:03:59,912 --> 03:04:00,512
[SPEAKER_27]: We can't really stay.

3200
03:04:00,772 --> 03:04:02,213
[SPEAKER_26]: I need to finish my website.

3201
03:04:02,933 --> 03:04:05,353
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah, that's why I've got to work on another website for somebody else.

3202
03:04:05,793 --> 03:04:06,594
[SPEAKER_27]: Zero, any final thoughts?

3203
03:04:06,614 --> 03:04:07,334
[SPEAKER_27]: Thanks for being here tonight.

3204
03:04:07,974 --> 03:04:08,334
[SPEAKER_23]: No problem.

3205
03:04:08,534 --> 03:04:09,574
[SPEAKER_23]: I'd come back whenever you wanted.

3206
03:04:09,794 --> 03:04:09,955
[SPEAKER_23]: Cool.

3207
03:04:10,795 --> 03:04:11,155
[SPEAKER_23]: I don't know.

3208
03:04:11,655 --> 03:04:13,755
[SPEAKER_23]: I would say if I was Willy Wonka, I would be really rich.

3209
03:04:14,136 --> 03:04:19,777
[SPEAKER_23]: And for the simple knowledge bands that don't know what I mean by get the fat kid out of my chocolate milk, and that's it.

3210
03:04:21,673 --> 03:04:23,994
[SPEAKER_26]: Rock, Jonas, any final thoughts?

3211
03:04:24,094 --> 03:04:24,954
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, not much.

3212
03:04:24,974 --> 03:04:26,494
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't spoken as usual as much.

3213
03:04:26,974 --> 03:04:30,035
[SPEAKER_05]: But, um, I'll be back next week again.

3214
03:04:31,216 --> 03:04:31,496
[SPEAKER_05]: Cool.

3215
03:04:32,296 --> 03:04:33,376
[SPEAKER_05]: This time probably on time.

3216
03:04:33,716 --> 03:04:35,657
[SPEAKER_27]: You can play match game next week.

3217
03:04:37,337 --> 03:04:37,797
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, sure.

3218
03:04:39,118 --> 03:04:41,058
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, be ready at 5 o'clock or so, maybe.

3219
03:04:44,119 --> 03:04:44,759
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah, they can't hear you.

3220
03:04:45,059 --> 03:04:47,120
[SPEAKER_23]: That was just dead air.

3221
03:04:47,280 --> 03:04:49,461
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm going to come back with them because I'll be ready at 5 o'clock.

3222
03:04:49,481 --> 03:04:49,541
[SPEAKER_23]: Hey.

3223
03:04:52,187 --> 03:04:53,187
[SPEAKER_27]: I don't really have a final thought.

3224
03:04:54,008 --> 03:04:54,568
[SPEAKER_27]: Life sucks.

3225
03:04:54,608 --> 03:04:55,268
[SPEAKER_27]: Go kill yourself.

3226
03:04:55,828 --> 03:04:56,188
[SPEAKER_27]: Hey!

3227
03:04:56,408 --> 03:04:57,008
[SPEAKER_27]: Just kidding.

3228
03:04:57,668 --> 03:04:59,309
[SPEAKER_27]: I didn't mean to look at you when I said that, Jamie.

3229
03:04:59,329 --> 03:05:00,129
[SPEAKER_27]: You don't need to kill yourself.

3230
03:05:00,149 --> 03:05:00,509
[SPEAKER_27]: You're fine.

3231
03:05:02,329 --> 03:05:02,629
[SPEAKER_19]: All right.

3232
03:05:02,649 --> 03:05:03,549
[SPEAKER_19]: Life sucks when you grow up.

3233
03:05:03,990 --> 03:05:04,410
[SPEAKER_27]: That's it.

3234
03:05:04,550 --> 03:05:04,770
[SPEAKER_27]: All right.

3235
03:05:04,790 --> 03:05:05,150
[SPEAKER_27]: Later, Jonas.

3236
03:05:05,170 --> 03:05:05,630
