1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,680
Do you want to hear the most annoying fan in the world?

2
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:20,080
You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio, the Monty Talk, and then some.

3
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:27,080
Orange Lounge may contain adult content. Orange Lounge may contain many four letter words.

4
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:30,080
Orange Lounge may contain a scene of nudity.

5
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:34,080
Orange Lounge may contain hot monkey sex.

6
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:37,080
Just kidding, Orange Lounge will not contain hot monkey sex. In this episode...

7
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:44,080
Hey, are there any balls down there?

8
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:46,080
About the biggest party I've ever seen, Dingleberry.

9
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:49,080
What's your favorite security movie?

10
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:53,080
Showgirls. Absolute frightful. What's yours?

11
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:56,080
There are no stupid questions, just stupid people.

12
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:59,080
Don't torture yourself. That's my job.

13
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:01,080
Now's the time on sprockets and we dance!

14
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:04,080
I don't get you, my pretty!

15
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,080
And your little dog, too!

16
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:07,080
I don't come through.

17
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:10,080
I'm sorry, but all questions must be submitted in writing.

18
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,080
Why did they have to take the word gay?

19
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:14,080
No!

20
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:17,080
All I want to expect for a Spanish expression is Hindu.

21
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:19,080
Hey!

22
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:22,080
Shut up!

23
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,080
Where's my gun?

24
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:45,280
My name is Rob Roberts and this is episode number 31 for February 2nd of 2003.

25
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:50,080
You're tuned into the Bamani Scene's most grounded radio station of all things B-Money.

26
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:52,920
My name is Rob Roberts and you might know me as Sky.

27
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:57,680
as always, are my awesome co-hosts. In the invisible corner is the happiest bunny on

28
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:02,400
the farm, Miss Jamie Summers. You know her better as DarkSakurai. She's running in here

29
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,720
like a chicken with a head cut off. What's up?

30
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:06,720
I re-picked my most funny. Oh, okay, cool.

31
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,920
I love you, buddy. Did you?

32
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:08,920
I love you, buddy. Thank you.

33
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:09,920
I love you, buddy. Thank you.

34
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:10,920
I love you, buddy. I love you, buddy.

35
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:15,920
All right. And you get... We have horrible mic noise again tonight, and I swear to God,

36
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:19,920
I fixed this problem before the show started. It's pissing me off. I'll see what I can do.

37
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:24,420
I'll see what I can do during the first break.

38
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:29,200
Also say hello to our other lovely co-host, or I should say more handsome co-host, I don't

39
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,660
think he likes to be called lovely.

40
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:35,720
Our handsome co-host, say hello to Artem Masaloki.

41
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:38,620
Also with us tonight, we have a whole buffet of guests in the studio.

42
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:44,640
Say hello to Brad, and we haven't had this gentleman on the show before, but say hello

43
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,640
Go To Zero!

44
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,640
Hey, how's it going?

45
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,640
Also out in the other room playing Animal Crossing's Irene.

46
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,640
She probably won't be on the show because she always plays Animal Crossing.

47
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,640
And Pancakes!

48
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,640
Pancakes!

49
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,640
I want to know something.

50
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,640
Where's Dave?

51
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,640
I've missed Dave. He's been out on the show a long time.

52
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,640
Dave, are you listening?

53
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,640
You should be over here right now.

54
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,640
I don't know. That is a good question.

55
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,640
Where has Dave been?

56
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,640
He hasn't been here for a few weeks.

57
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:21,640
Puppy and Tal are at Scandinavia. They were there for Tal's birthday and they were supposed to be here by now, but they're not.

58
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:24,640
So that means punishment.

59
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:30,640
So yeah. Hello. So we're going to talk about a whole bunch of stuff tonight.

60
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:35,640
We have interviews from the tournament that happened on Friday at Milpitas Golf Land. We've got those.

61
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:38,640
I know tons of you are just looking forward to that.

62
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:42,840
And, uh, we'll get to everything else a bit later, but first we're going to take a quick break,

63
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:47,640
and, uh, I thought we'd start off this first break with some Twispy!

64
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:49,640
Oh, any other opening thoughts to the folks here?

65
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:51,640
Oh, did the missing people just show up?

66
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:52,640
Oh, let's say hello to them.

67
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:53,640
Oh, there they are!

68
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:54,640
You're late.

69
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:55,640
You're late.

70
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:56,640
Shut the fuck up, man.

71
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,640
What's up? Okay, we have Tal. Say hello to Tal.

72
00:03:58,640 --> 00:03:59,640
Hi.

73
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,640
And then we have Puppy. Puppy's here.

74
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:02,640
Hi.

75
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:05,640
And then, in the back, there's Ryan.

76
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:07,640
Oh, shut the fuck up, man.

77
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:08,640
What?

78
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:09,640
Chock-a-da-ball.

79
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:10,640
I don't know.

80
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:11,640
You know what that means, right?

81
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:12,640
Okay.

82
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:13,640
Chock-a-da-ball.

83
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:16,640
Oh, I received a message from the chatroom.

84
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:19,640
Snub just told me Davis and Houston are visiting the grandparents.

85
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:20,640
That's where Davis is.

86
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:23,640
Well, we were asking where Davis is.

87
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:26,640
Dude, what the fuck is that?

88
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:27,640
What happened?

89
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:30,640
I heard a can of soda open.

90
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:31,640
Oh.

91
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:36,640
But Mountain Dew's not supposed to smell like that, yo.

92
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:38,640
It's always exciting here at Orange Mountain Dew.

93
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:40,640
Red Red Mountain Dew smells like a fart.

94
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:45,640
What the hell is this? DNL?

95
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:48,640
It's 7-Up upside down. What is this?

96
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:54,640
DNL is basically the opposite of 7-Up, as in the logo is upside down,

97
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:56,640
and instead of being a green bottle with clear liquid,

98
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:59,640
it's a clear bottle with green liquid inside.

99
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:02,640
It's caffeinated instead of just being fucking normal.

100
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:06,640
It tastes like 7-Up with a kick of Mountain Dew, and it's actually really good.

101
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:10,640
Yeah, but this year I've been drinking, like, day and night, and it's, like, better than Blue.

102
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:11,640
Let me smell it.

103
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:12,640
It's okay.

104
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:15,640
It's okay. It's alright.

105
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:19,640
Okay, we're gonna take a break now. We'll come back and talk about all the, uh...

106
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:22,640
Yeah, search is what I was gonna say. It's kinda like search. Anyway.

107
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:23,640
I like search.

108
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:24,640
We'll take a quick break.

109
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:25,640
I hate Mountain Dew.

110
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:28,640
And we'll be back to talk about all sorts of fun things, get to those interviews,

111
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:29,400
views

112
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:32,980
maybe place of the mind that it was with some of our favorite stuff

113
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:36,500
and uh... taking your calls just kidding store

114
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:40,500

115
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,500
Haha

116
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:12,500
Oh

117
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:23,500
I don't think I'm gonna get a plan, baby I don't think I'm gonna get a plan, baby

118

And we're grooving, groove it, groove it, groove it until your honor's done

124
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:22,200
And then we're grooving, babyatory

125
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:25,860
We're grooving, groove it, groove it, groove it until your honor's done

126
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:32,720
Yow, yeah, yeah

145
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:31,600
We have a holy shit. Gee golliness.

146
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:35,320
Wow, there's like so much animes in here.

147
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,740
Rupan...

148
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:41,540
Whoa, why are you still sticking that in my face? Because we want to hear what you've got.

149
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:44,680
Um, name an anime and it's probably in here.

150
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:51,680
Or at least ones that haven't come out yet, like Noir and KK and Jay, or, I'm sorry, In America, His and Hers, stupidest goddamn translation of a name ever.

151
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:53,680
Nuku Nuku!

152
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:54,680
What's this?

153
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:56,680
Ooh, now what is this shit here?

154
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:00,680
That's like that old-school game Crossfire.

155
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:01,680
Yes!

156
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:02,680
Crossfire was cool.

157
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,680
This thing is rad!

158
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:08,680
But the big box that it came in's got, like, cool anime people on it and, like, shit, it looks tight.

159
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:09,680
Okay, you know what?

160
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:10,680
What?

161
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:13,680
Someone needs to bring Crossfire to this show and we're gonna have a Crossfire tournament.

162
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:25,680
Alright, that game right there, that is Beyblade. It's Fighting Tops. Can you believe that they made an anime about people fighting tops? It's the most retarded thing ever.

163
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,680
You believe this chick has missile boobs.

164
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:33,680
No, allow me to read the back of the Beyblade DVD.

165
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:38,680
As a young Beyblader, Tyson has a dream to be the best Blader in the world.

166
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:44,680
Feeling confident with his technique, Tyson decides to challenge Kai, the leader of the undefeated Blade Sharks.

167
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:46,680
Does it say Challenge God?

168
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:47,680
Kai.

169
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,680
Oh, so now they have a Digimon character in here.

170
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:53,680
Yes. Unfortunately, Tyson is crushed by the awesome power of Kai's blue blade.

171
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:57,680
Vowing revenge, he begins his quest to rebuild his Beyblade!

172
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:59,680
Oh my god, this is the fruitiest goddamn thing ever!

173
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:03,680
But once, we did talk about Golden Stream

174
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:05,680
Yes, we did talk about Golden Stream

175
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:09,680
So, why is it that all you Bimani freaks are into anime?

176
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:13,680
Why is it that all the anime freaks are into Bimani is what you mean, right?

177
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,680
We were here first

178
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:21,680
Well, I mean, it's like, um...

179
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:24,680
What the hell is Black Lion? I haven't even looked at it yet.

180
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:26,680
You don't know Black Lion?

181
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:28,680
Man, old school.

182
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:31,680
Well, not really old school, but it's still pretty old.

183
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:35,680
You know, if you'd only entered the edit contest, you would have probably won that.

184
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,680
What edit contest?

185
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:40,680
The one that was on Friday?

186
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:42,680
The one that you missed?

187
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:44,680
I went to go play 2DX, not edit.

188
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:46,680
Whatever.

189
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:48,680
I'm sorry.

190
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:53,680
I can't make edits. My edits are like Bemani ruler edits. They're crappy.

191
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:55,680
If I make you an edit, will you give me some porn?

192
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:58,680
Uh, okay.

193
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:03,680
Rob.

194
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,680
Rob, put this in your butt.

195
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:08,680
Hi, what's up? Sorry, I'm trying to work on that sound problem.

196
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:10,680
Nice hosting job, Rob.

197
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:16,680
We've got background issues today, so I'm trying to get rid of some of that background noise for you guys listening.

198
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:18,680
So does everyone else hear it?

199
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:19,400
Yeah.

200
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,240
I hear it a little bit.

201
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:26,200
They're also having a little bit of a hard time hearing you,

202
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:28,960
Jamie, so you've got to give head to the mic.

203
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,680
How's that?

204
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:31,680
Is that better?

205
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:36,360
Let me, I'm going to turn down our volume a little bit so that,

206
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:38,200
I'm going to turn down our mic volume,

207
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,760
but everybody's going to have to talk super loud,

208
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:40,600
or they're not going to be able to hear you.

209
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:41,600
So go down a little bit.

210
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:42,520
That's not a problem.

211
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:44,000
All right.

212
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:44,800
Beautiful.

213
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,440
Let's talk to the person that has never been here before.

214
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,040
Oh, great.

215
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:49,240
What's up, Zero?

216
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:50,040
Nothing much.

217
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:52,200
So what brings you here to the studio tonight?

218
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,560
You invited me last week.

219
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:55,360
Oh, yeah.

220
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,200
So how did you get?

221
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:59,840
Isn't Zero X old?

222
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,080
What do you mean?

223
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:03,240
Because on that thread that was on the side of the line.

224
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,480
As old as you are, pal.

225
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,880
As old as you are.

226
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,360
Because I remember, like, Vandalous

227
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:09,680
is saying, like, you are the oldest one.

228
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:11,560
And then underneath that was, like, you guys

229
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:13,960
and that whole senior citizen squad over there.

230
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:14,960
Hey!

231
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:16,960
Hey, wait a minute!

232
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:18,960
I feel great now.

233
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:21,960
So how did you get into this whole stupid arrow-smashing game?

234
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:26,960
Um, found it one day when I was on a vacation down Santa Cruz, then heard RBGL.

235
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,960
Oh god, you started playing at the boardwalk?

236
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:29,960
Yeah.

237
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:30,960
Oh shit.

238
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:31,960
The worst of the world.

239
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:33,960
Isn't that where they filmed The Lost Boys?

240
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:35,960
Yep, it sure is.

241
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:38,960
My, um, one of my fiance's friends is a DJ there.

242
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:39,960
Really?

243
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:40,960
DJ Tripp.

244
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:43,960
I haven't heard of them, but I've heard.

245
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:49,960
Anyways, yeah, I started playing there, and then I heard the horrible-ass RVGL had it.

246
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:52,960
So I started playing there when it was good, and then...

247
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:54,960
Well, it was a horrible-ass back when we started.

248
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:57,960
Not back then, but now it is. That's why I said it was good back then.

249
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:00,960
23rd Magus had a funny new nickname for Roseville Golf Land.

250
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:03,960
Could you post that in the chatroom so I can read it, because it was funny.

251
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:07,960
Well, I mean, RVGL, when we started, dude, it had the 4th mix with USA and stuff.

252
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:08,960
They were God, dude.

253
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:16,960
It was fun to play. The first time I saw Kick the Can Doubles, it was like, oh my god, there's someone playing doubles, and it's Kick the Can, hard song ever.

254
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:17,960
Yeah, I know.

255
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:30,960
But, you know, things happen and people change, and then they get Max instead of getting our 4th Plus or our 5th Mix, and then they get Max 2, and we still have the USA and Max 2, and then they get, what is it now, 4th Plus?

256
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:31,960
4th Plus and Max.

257
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:32,960
Extreme?

258
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:33,960
Or Extreme now.

259
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:36,960
Who cares? I don't follow that crap.

260
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:41,840
I got yelled at on, because you know, there's been kind of in the Sacramento community and

261
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:44,680
Orange Launch World headquarters happens to be in Sacramento, and I know there's a lot

262
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:48,280
of you not in Sacramento listening, but of course if you listen to this show enough you've

263
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:51,280
kept up on Sacramento politics because all we ever do is bitch.

264
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:54,480
That's what we're best at.

265
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:57,120
A lot of us are boycotting Roosevelt Golf Land because we're sick of their shit and they

266
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,120
don't upgrade their games.

267
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:03,460
I got bitched at on DDR Freak because I went to Roosevelt Golf Land and got high scores

268
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:07,380
on the machine, and somebody was like, well, if you're boycotting Rod's Oak Golf Land,

269
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:09,940
how come you have scores on the machine, hmm?

270
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:14,500
Oh my God. Who dug with Kobe up, and why the fuck is he bugging us, though?

271
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:18,820
Somebody gave me tokens for free anyway, so it wasn't like I didn't really cross the line.

272
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:20,380
You know, how am I going to pass out DDR?

273
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:23,940
It's like this, okay? I'm going to go to Golf Land, because I have tons of tokens I bought

274
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:28,220
down on Piedis Golf Land. No, I'm not going to drive two hours to go spend these tokens

275
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:31,680
at another Golf Land. They can go, you know, kiss my ass for that. I already spent the

276
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:36,280
money at Golfland. Golfland already has my money. It would be a waste if I didn't.

277
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:40,960
That's exactly what my point of view is. If I've still got token to Golfland, there's

278
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:45,120
a drum mania machine there that works on occasion, and when it works, I can pump tokens in and

279
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:50,600
fuck it up and then leave. I've used up all mine, and now that my car

280
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:54,760
is tested and fixed and everything, I'm going to be heading my butt to Milpitas to play

281
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:59,120
the horsie racing game. Speaking of Golfland and Milpitas Golfland,

282
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:04,120
If you're just joining us, we do have the interviews from Milpitas tournament that took place on Friday.

283
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:06,120
We'll get to those a little later when we're ready.

284
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:08,120
Whatever.

285
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:09,120
Let's talk more to zero.

286
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:13,120
So, are you a PA-er or a freestyler?

287
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:15,120
Freestyler. One of the few.

288
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,120
Ah.

289
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:17,120
Anymore.

290
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:18,120
So what kind of freestyle do you do?

291
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:20,120
Here's the next big question then.

292
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:22,120
Are you an improver or a routiner?

293
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:26,120
I would kind of say more routine than improv.

294
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:28,120
Just because this is stuff I know.

295
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:32,120
I freestyle what you guys all call like 18, like all the old stuff.

296
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:33,120
Oh, you're old school?

297
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:34,120
Yeah.

298
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:35,120
That's cool.

299
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,120
So you like to like rate bars and-

300
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:37,120
No, I don't do-

301
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:38,120
Oh, you don't do-

302
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:39,120
I don't touch the bar any-

303
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:40,120
Really?

304
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:41,120
How do you do 18 freestyle without touching the bar?

305
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,120
Just don't touch it.

306
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:43,120
Just do everything else, but-

307
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:46,120
See, 18 is all about the bar and the knees, bro.

308
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:47,120
Yeah, I do-

309
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:48,120
The bar, knees, and hands.

310
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:49,120
I do knees.

311
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:51,120
I do everything else, but I don't touch the bar.

312
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:55,120
Dude, today I saw Loki doing his XC edit again, and he did the little freeze bit and then

313
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:58,480
freeze bit and then dropped his knees out and you could just see his face just go like

314
00:18:58,480 --> 00:18:59,480
oh motherfuck.

315
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:03,720
Yeah it's like my thing, I mean like when it comes to swinging my legs over the bar

316
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:07,280
and stuff I just don't touch the bar when I spin, that's it, because I hate the bar.

317
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:10,780
The bar is icky and slimy because everyone else does it.

318
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:14,100
I know and everybody's like all sweating because they're playing D.R. and their little mitts

319
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:17,920
are all over the bar and then they have like a lot of bars have those little black padding

320
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:19,960
things on them that just soak up all that crap.

321
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:22,280
I watched a guy wipe his head on those bars.

322
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:23,280
Oh gross.

323
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:25,280
That's the reason I don't touch them.

324
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:28,280
I once put them between my legs and I rode them.

325
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:30,280
And it was good.

326
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:32,280
And that's why we don't touch the bars.

327
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:34,280
I saw someone get nutted on one.

328
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:36,280
We were there for that.

329
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:38,280
When Rick flipped Timmy.

330
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:40,280
Oh yeah.

331
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:43,280
I got that nickname for Roswell Golf Land by the way from 23 Maggots.

332
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:46,280
He's calling it Runny Venerio Gooland.

333
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:48,280
That was pretty good.

334
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:52,280
Yeah, haha. We're so mature.

335
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:54,280
Did you hear that one, Jamie?

336
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:56,280
Run Even Ariel Gooland.

337
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:00,280
That made me smile.

338
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:03,280
Oh my gosh, hot.

339
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:08,280
USFBB, I have to ask a question to this because this is kind of a running question about freestyle on the show.

340
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:15,280
Zero, why is it that throughout all the routines that we've seen, nobody ever whips their cock out at the end?

341
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:19,280
I think somebody would probably call the police or something if you get kicked out.

342
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:24,280
You know, it's the whole thing of the pants you wear to DDR, just don't come down so quickly.

343
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:26,280
Because if they came down quickly, you'd fall over yourself.

344
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:29,280
I don't know, depending on the cock, I'd give them a high score.

345
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,280
That's probably why most people don't do it.

346
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:34,280
You know, there's a lot of people who say that there's a lot of gay people in the DDR community.

347
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:36,280
This is probably why!

348
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:39,280
Bust that neurotic song, whip out your cock, and then just...

349
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:41,280
Kakumei, right? Isn't that the way it works?

350
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:46,280
If there's girls that can get up there and push their boobs together and call it a routine, then you know...

351
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:48,280
Well, you know...

352
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:50,280
Last message.

353
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:52,280
Last message.

354
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:58,280
Uh, yeah, that was all inspired because the OSFB was suggesting that someone could whip their cock out and rub it on the bar.

355
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:00,280
That would be sick.

356
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:02,280
That would be bar raping.

357
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:04,280
Another reason you don't touch the bar.

358
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:06,280
Oh my god, that's so true.

359
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:08,280
I have little mini bars running around.

360
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:10,280
Damn, dude.

361
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:21,280
Wouldn't it be funny if somebody got up there to do a routine and then like, you know, whipped out like a cooler with all this liquor in it and said, look, I'm holding on to the bar.

362
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,280
That was interesting.

363
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:23,280
The bar?

364
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:26,280
Yes, I get it.

365
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:32,280
You are not the wind.

366
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:36,280
I want to do an episode of Orange Lounge with a gong.

367
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:40,280
Dude, we would be fucking whacking that thing left and right.

368
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:46,280
No little gong either. I want to wheel a giant gong in here and put it in the back.

369
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:51,280
We actually have one at our work. Every time someone gets a new customer, they hit the gong.

370
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:55,280
I kid you not. You'd be talking on the phone and sitting here.

371
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:58,280
Customer's like, what was that? What are you talking about? I don't hear anything.

372
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:00,280
It's hilarious.

373
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:04,280
Speaking of which, tonight I'm going to be uploading a few pictures from Orange Land Radio

374
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:07,400
because the fact that you know I've got my digital camera here and I've got a

375
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:12,680
website that was given to me nicely enough not yet because it's not up yet

376
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:17,240
but I'll let you guys know by next week when all my shit is up and ready I

377
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:21,160
believe Jamie is pulling her eye down and sick your tongue at me in the anime

378
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:29,760
girl fashion I'm not sure why though yeah yeah I'll get around to mine when I

379
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:36,040
I get around the mine. No more deadlines. I'm not, I don't like being imposed, you know,

380
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:39,720
all these deadlines enforced on me. They'll come up whenever, you know.

381
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:42,520
But yeah, I'm going to take like a handful of pictures, because I've been taking pictures

382
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:45,960
for my whole birthday weekend in Chittenden, so I figure if I grab a few from here, I'll

383
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:51,520
stick them on there. Besides, um, I wasn't going to ask, we've

384
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:56,000
been getting a lot of listeners through that Leech from Loki site, so where are you advertising

385
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:01,120
that site besides the show, because you're already getting a lot of hits apparently.

386
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:06,120
Everyone that emails me and goes, why aren't you updating your site, because there's a

387
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:07,120
new site.

388
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:08,120
Oh.

389
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:09,120
Oh.

390
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:11,720
Did you hear that I started a new sim file, even though I haven't finished the old one?

391
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:12,720
What'd you start?

392
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:13,720
A new one.

393
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:15,840
I'm not going to tell you what song, but you know.

394
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:17,400
I'll tell you what song off-air.

395
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:21,880
Well, obviously the listeners will know later on, but I did a remix today.

396
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:24,080
Ah, yes, we're going to hear that, huh?

397
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:25,080
Yes.

398
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:30,080
There might be a wicked sim file to go with that.

399
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:32,080
Oh, you'll have to listen to it.

400
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:35,080
You'll find out, won't you, little boy?

401
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:38,080
Yeah, okay.

402
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:40,080
Hey, why don't you give us a sim update, Logy?

403
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:43,080
Well, I wish there was something to update on.

404
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:45,080
There really isn't much going on.

405
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:46,080
Let's see here.

406
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:48,080
Bimani's cell, DJ Paranot is taking a break.

407
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:52,080
I'm putting up the DDR Extreme files because he's tired.

408
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:54,080
I can understand that.

409
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:59,080
Do you know what happened to the DDR Extreme files that were on DMI Style? They're gone.

410
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:05,080
They're re-uploading them with backgrounds and sync steps and full steps and that kind of thing.

411
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:13,080
But if you're looking for DDR Extreme stuff, there's some people that are uploading stuff to BumaniSims.com. You can find stuff there.

412
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:19,080
It's kind of like another site that was doing the exact same thing as I was doing, which was going to have people being able to upload their own files.

413
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:22,760
your own files. Of course, it's kind of very basic, and they just have a CGI script, which

414
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:26,920
you can do stuff. Of course, I'm going to be making full, beautiful web pages as soon

415
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:29,680
as I get my site up, and, yeah.

416
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:30,680
Sure you are.

417
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:38,400
I am. I'm just working on downloading, er, I'm working on sorting 2,000 files, you know.

418
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,400
It's kind of difficult.

419
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:46,240
Simple. You just put them in alphabetical order by game and song and artist and BPM.

420
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:47,240
No, it's not going to work.

421
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:48,240
And BPM and...

422
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:50,240
What did you do?

423
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:53,240
Jamie's been taking random pics with my digicam

424
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:57,240
and from, oh my god, she's doing the dancer pose, it's so gay

425
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:02,240
Hey, that's not a bad picture, that's pretty good

426
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:08,240
There's some cool stuff I got, like last night I got the Axifoli techno theme, that was kind of funny

427
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:12,240
DWI 2.40? Did that come out?

428
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:16,240
Well, it might have, but I don't use DWI anymore, so that means nothing to me

429
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:21,240
But for those who do, there's been new DWI versions coming out.

430
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:29,240
Actually, DWI now supports Winamp plug-ins, I believe, for visualizations and that kind of shit.

431
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:34,240
So that's out. Plus, they've been supporting Lyrics for a while, which is kind of cool.

432
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:36,240
Then there's going to be the new version.

433
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:44,240
There's going to be the new StepMania that they're working on right now that's going to be supporting what's done in 2DX and BeatMania.

434
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:48,240
Dude, if you haven't played Belovin' on Xtreme, you've gotta play it.

435
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:50,240
Greatest fucking song ever.

436
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:52,240
So, we have that, and they're releasing it now.

437
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:54,240
Oh my god, play Belovin' at the commercial break. You have to play Belovin' at the commercial break, come on.

438
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:57,240
Oh my god, it's on, be made in fuckin' 7th mix.

439
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:59,240
OST.

440
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:01,240
Greatest song ever.

441
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:03,240
It seriously is. You have to play it. Like, play it now.

442
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:04,240
If I can find it!

443
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:07,240
Oh dude, I played Little Bitches' Oni Steps today.

444
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:11,240
They're hella fun. I was, like, surprised that they were actually really well done.

445
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:16,240
I mean, all of the oni steps for like these stupid gay songs, like uh, I'm sorry, not gay songs,

446
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:22,240
rather, these old songs from DVR First Mix, and they're, the butterfly oni steps are pretty cool-looking,

447
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:26,240
the little bitch oni steps are cool, the, the Dom Deere Rom oni steps are cool, I mean-

448
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:28,240
They're not, there are no oni steps for Dom Deere.

449
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:36,240
Okay, well the Dom Deere Rom video is cool, uh, but I, it's amazing these old-school songs that they put onis to, and shit like that.

450
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:38,240
Oh, because they fucked up on the steps the first time!

451
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:41,240
Well no dude, Butterfly Basic is still one of the best hits ever.

452
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:44,240
It's something like Beat On Extreme?

453
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:46,240
Uh, no.

454
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:48,240
Shit. What about, um...

455
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,240
Uh, anyways.

456
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:52,240
So, um...

457
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:53,240
What do I do with my camera?

458
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:54,240
Oh, here we go.

459
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:55,240
Yeah.

460
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:57,240
Um, there's a, yeah.

461
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:00,240
Um, let's see here, what else?

462
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:03,240
Oh yeah, uh, DWI Insanity, I think I mentioned this last week,

463
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:08,560
last week. They've got Easy to Dancer sim files now, or their DWIs for Easy to Dancer

464
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:15,560
songs. So check those out. See, aside from all that stuff, there's not really much going

465
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:20,760
on. There's another style, 2003, some sim file contest that's going to be going on for

466
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:28,760
a while. Supposedly, it's like, I believe the entries are due sometime in April or so,

467
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:33,960
and then they're judging them in September, kind of a waste away there, but whatever.

468
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:41,960
So there's that one, and I'm sure Turn You Mix 3 will be sometime this summer, er, 4, I mean Turn You Mix 4, sometimes this summer, and uh...

469
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:42,960
And now?

470
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:52,160
Yeah, and the really crappy DDR Extreme skins for StepMania, I mean, it's alright, but I think the one for DWI looked much better.

471
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:59,160
One problem with step manias, instead of saying perfects and greats it says hi guys and bye guys and all this crap like that.

472
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:02,160
It is so horrible. I laughed for a month on just one.

473
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:09,160
It's the skin thing. You're going to hear about this during the interviews because we talked to some of the folks from Killer Pals.

474
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:11,160
That's their whole little joke is the hi guys and bye guys thing.

475
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:15,160
See the thing is that can be easily fixed. I fixed that instantly.

476
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:20,160
I'm still playing off of the SM Match 2 skin, because that's my favorite one so far.

477
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:24,160
And now this kicking of Rob is brought to you by Propel.

478
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:26,160
Hey! Ow!

479
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:28,160
You suck.

480
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:30,160
They had ass-flavored Propel. Damn it, we should give this to you.

481
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:32,160
Why do they have ass-flavored Propel?

482
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:33,160
It's lemon.

483
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:36,160
That's all they had at Walgreens earlier today was lemon.

484
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:37,160
Lemon!

485
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:38,160
Bleh.

486
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:39,160
Well, it's not that bad.

487
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:40,160
I spit on lemon.

488
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:41,160
It's not that good either.

489
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:42,160
Bleh.

490
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:43,160
Pooey.

491
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:45,160
Okay, you want to do FUs of the Week?

492
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:45,660
Yes!

493
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:48,660
Alright, we'll take a break and then do FUs, how's that?

494
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:49,160
Okay.

495
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:51,160
Alright, we're going to take a break, we'll come back and do the FUs of the Week,

496
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:54,160
so you can send those to me over private messages in the chatroom,

497
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:56,660
or to our email, OrangeLoungeRadioYahoo.com.

498
00:28:56,660 --> 00:28:59,160
And if you're not in our chatroom, why the hell aren't you?

499
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:02,160
Get over to our website, http colon slash slash,

500
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:05,660
OrangeLounge.SKIE.CX.

501
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:10,160
And after the FUs of the Week, we'll think about doing those mopedis interviews.

502
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:11,160
How's that sound?

503
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:26,160
We will be right back, by request from Tal, because he's such a baby. We're gonna hear Belovin' and Daikonkai. Alright, we'll be back.

504
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:43,160
Yeah

505
00:33:41,160 --> 00:34:10,360
Hi, this is Melby of RTF.

506
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:16,360
And for an extra $1.99 a minute, my girlfriend, Melvie, can join us on all the fun together.

507
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:22,360
Hey, if you're a broke-ass like I am, why don't you come to the one place that costs absolutely nothing to go to and still the fun is just as great?

508
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:29,360
It's Orange Lounge Radio, Sunday nights. Kick it with me and you just might realize the best things in life are free.

509
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:58,360
How did I get on your friend list? And Samia's like, well Tal, it's not like you ever update your live journal anyways.

510
00:34:58,360 --> 00:35:02,360
I mean, no one talks. When you update, it's like, oh my god, you updated for the first time.

511
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:09,360
Being a force physicist, given how much I update, especially my verbal vomit lately.

512
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:12,360
Your posts are starting to look like mine.

513
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:15,360
Well, I've had a bad week, okay? I'm not normally angst bubble.

514
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:17,360
Nice triforce.

515
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:22,360
Isn't that a cool triforce? My uncle made it for me in India. It's made out of silver, so I don't think you can pick it up and post it later.

516
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:23,360
Okay.

517
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:24,360
So yes, are we still filming?

518
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:25,360
No.

519
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:28,360
Oh, it like bombed out quite some time ago, but...

520
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:35,360
We cut out the chat room we pinged out of during the break, so we got kind of screwed up there, so...

521
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:36,360
Send the FUs here.

522
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:40,360
We're back now though, but you can resend your FUs to us if you're in the chat room.

523
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:41,360
Yeah.

524
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:46,360
So send those FUs to me over private message, and if you sent it while I was gone, obviously I didn't get them.

525
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:50,960
So I only have FUs from Stress, 23 Maggots, Dark Tetsuya, and DCB at this point.

526
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:54,560
So if you're not on that list, send them to me over IRC or...

527
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:55,260
Email!

528
00:35:55,260 --> 00:35:57,260
Email, OrangeLawnsRadioYahoo.com

529
00:35:57,260 --> 00:35:59,960
So, let's...

530
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:01,660
I say we go ahead and get started.

531
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:02,160
Alright.

532
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:02,960
We're going to do TerraMix.

533
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:04,460
Alright, you want TerraMix this week?

534
00:36:04,460 --> 00:36:04,760
Yes.

535
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:05,960
Alright, we're going to do the FUs of the Week.

536
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:09,360
So we have some new listeners tonight because earlier today...

537
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:12,360
Earlier today I spammed the DDR LiveJournal community,

538
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:16,360
so I know we're going to have some new listeners tonight to explain what the FUs of the Week is all about.

539
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:20,360
This is where we get angsty, bitchy, and we tell you all about it.

540
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:25,360
But you get to participate too, but you don't get to say it yourself, we do, because we have microphones and therefore the power.

541
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:27,360
Yes. Very well. Very well put.

542
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:31,360
But, this is, um, just start it. They'll figure it out.

543
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:33,360
Alright, here we go, FUs.

544
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:34,360
Because we're a complete moron.

545
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:36,360
Starting with the one and only.

546
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:43,360
We're not morons. If you're listening to us, you're not a moron.

547
00:36:46,460 --> 00:36:48,460
This is fucked up.

548
00:36:48,460 --> 00:36:52,460
I always have to wait for that. That's what you do.

549
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:56,460
Anyway, my first psyche of the week goes toward wall games.

550
00:36:56,460 --> 00:36:58,860
We're not having dairy or peach flavored Propell.

551
00:36:58,860 --> 00:37:02,860
I'm having only lemon, which is the ass of all flavors of Propell.

552
00:37:02,860 --> 00:37:06,860
Although not that bad, because of the sound that everyone can see, it's not the best.

553
00:37:06,860 --> 00:37:11,860
So, ass to ass, that certainly is butt track.

554
00:37:11,860 --> 00:37:21,860
Um, my other fucking of the week goes to this ugly bitch that was driving behind me yesterday when I was following, uh, Jabberwocky, running Aaron.

555
00:37:21,860 --> 00:37:26,860
Dude, Dark Sakura goes psychotic in the car, it is awesome.

556
00:37:26,860 --> 00:37:32,220
In the two minutes I was in there, I was just like, wow, waiting for the, you know, big

557
00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:36,420
hella hard level three super to come out and turn us all into ash with these, what is it,

558
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:41,700
lights, lights, lights went forward, some, some, some, you know, her, the dark Sakura

559
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:42,700
super.

560
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:43,700
The Harugoku.

561
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:44,700
Yes.

562
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:45,700
Yeah, and it just kicks your ass seven ways from Sunday.

563
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:46,700
Hey, I'm trying to be angsty here.

564
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:47,700
Give me that.

565
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:48,700
Ooh, two microphones.

566
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:49,700
Bah.

567
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:51,200
Here, gimme that.

568
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:52,700
Ooh, it's a microphone.

569
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:54,200
Bah!

570
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:57,200
Um, as my view goes toward, um...

571
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:01,200
Oh, shit. I don't know what else to-

572
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:04,200
Oh, yeah, I was talking about the ugly bitch behind me.

573
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:05,700
Okay.

574
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:07,700
No, not you. Here.

575
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:15,200
Um, anyway, I'm trying to keep following distance, you know, which is how you're supposed to drive, by law.

576
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:18,400
I used to keep up three seconds following distance climbs

577
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:21,200
and this one, every time I'd stop, she'd be right up on my bumper

578
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:25,200
and I always leave, you know, about a foot between me and the next car

579
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:27,200
Welcome to California, here's your license

580
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:29,200
She was fucking ugly though

581
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:31,200
and I would look in my rearview mirror and there'd be this face

582
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:35,200
Okay, and me normally, I'm not, I'm not one to say about how people look

583
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:37,200
I'm normally not that superficial

584
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:40,200
I don't care how big somebody is, I don't care what they look like

585
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:43,200
The chicken last message looked like a horse

586
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:46,200
But I am not superficial like that.

587
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:48,200
But I'm sorry, this woman scared me.

588
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:52,200
She had this, I think, condition.

589
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:54,200
But she looked like a...

590
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:59,200
A skin condition or like missing a nose condition or what?

591
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:01,200
She looked like a rhinoceros.

592
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:06,200
She had these folds of skin where skin should not have folds.

593
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:09,200
And then her eyes were shrunken deep into her head.

594
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:15,200
And her eyes looked swollen. And then she had like really ugly hair.

595
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:21,200
It was like really curly and she would bump my car.

596
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:27,200
So finally I hit a stop sign and I just stayed there.

597
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:30,200
I stayed there for three minutes.

598
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:32,200
And I didn't let her go.

599
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:35,200
She would start to turn, I would just be bored and just...

600
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:42,200
So, then I immediately went on my way, and eventually the bitch turned, and something got me clean as I was, like, happy.

601
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:45,200
And then this other ugly person got behind me.

602
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:49,200
And she was almost as scary, but not quite as bad, but she was just as bad as the driver.

603
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:53,200
Oh my God, I hate people here. I do not really hate everyone.

604
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:56,200
And then...

605
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:58,200
How do we at least go through this?

606
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:01,200
You're not supposed to, it's my fucking own school.

607
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:04,200
Is that it, or do you have more?

608
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:14,200
I had another one that, just remembering that woman's face, sort of gave me an involuntary lobotomy.

609
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:19,200
Not actually having the front lobe of my brain, but just having it listed inert.

610
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:27,200
And by the way, you can look up inert at www.inertionary.com. It's called I-N-E-R-C.

611
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:32,200
I-N-E-what?

612
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:36,200
It hurts!

613
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:41,200
Moving on, next FV of the Week. Lowkey, let's hear it.

614
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:45,200
We didn't want to grab the microphone.

615
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:50,200
Okay, first FV of the Week goes to the stupid news coverage of the Space Hill.

616
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:53,200
Listen, to be honest, you're a dumbass.

617
00:40:53,200 --> 00:41:00,200
So, some retard that was building space shuttle forgot to put a freaking, no, heat sensitive tile on the wing.

618
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:03,200
And that, oh, I guess caused the shuttle to burn up at Mach 18.

619
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:08,200
Not to mention that the Columbia is the oldest space shuttle. It was an operation.

620
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:09,200
It doesn't matter.

621
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:13,200
Twenty fucking years old. That thing should not be retrofitted.

622
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:14,200
It shouldn't be in space.

623
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:18,200
Shut up! I'm talking! Not you! I'm talking.

624
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:20,200
I'm learning that you are.

625
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:27,480
stop talking anyway anyway so um yeah what did they not know it was actually al-qaeda

626
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:32,680
they sent me a skyscraper up into the sky that's what pissed me off about all this news coverage

627
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:37,640
yes the columbia blowing up is a tragedy you know anytime people die it's sad but like the media

628
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:43,720
blew it up into this like huge event where it was like oh my god iraq like snuck a bomb on the plane

629
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:44,720
and blew people up.

630
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:52,720
Now, the people that I fell bad for, like everybody else, were the people who were actually

631
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:55,720
involved in it, like NASA, the government, the family.

632
00:41:55,720 --> 00:41:59,720
And the friends that I had just saw it happen.

633
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:01,720
Anyway, my cousin who knew them all.

634
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:02,720
Wow, don't care.

635
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:03,720
Okay, anyways.

636
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:04,720
Hold on a sec.

637
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:07,720
I feel bad for the government.

638
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:10,720
Let me finish, goddammit, or you're going to be added to the list.

639
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:13,720
I didn't have to pay for this, and it's gonna come out of my pocket.

640
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:44,720
Ever since the stupid thing blew up, we had sensor failure in the left wing.

641
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:47,720
Maybe the trouble started in the left wing?

642
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:53,720
Yahoo, it's Reuters. It's a British news reporter.

643
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:58,720
It doesn't matter, they still suck.

644
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:04,720
It doesn't matter, they still suck. They're still covering people that are getting hurt imitating jackass stuff.

645
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:07,720
Even though the show's been off the TV for like, you know, over a year now.

646
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:09,720
I don't know, you sound like you're a Yakuza.

647
00:43:37,720 --> 00:43:47,240
seen and like that guy that was quote-unquote the word like okay now I'm

648
00:43:47,240 --> 00:43:56,880
sure you're anyway I'm sure that you know at the time the freak experiment

649
00:43:56,880 --> 00:44:01,120
with the cow and pig jeans brought together to make some weird human but it

650
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:05,520
might have been a good idea at the time but no it wasn't and you really suck and

651
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:09,280
And I'm also sick and tired of the secret people that are whining because they're like,

652
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:12,880
I PARTIED AND I CAN'T SING NOW.

653
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:15,380
I'M FAMOUS ALREADY.

654
00:44:15,380 --> 00:44:17,380
I'M GOING TO BE FAMOUS NO MATTER WHAT.

655
00:44:17,380 --> 00:44:31,380
The person who I have spectrophotically never tried to try out is the one who came in with a snake bite with a, uh, uh, sorry, uh, brown recluse, boyfriend, bite, and still sang very well.

656
00:44:31,380 --> 00:44:37,180
yeah

657
00:44:37,180 --> 00:44:40,580
alright, enough of that, now we're going to go back to the reoccurring

658
00:44:40,580 --> 00:44:46,940
after you of stupid drivers

659
00:44:46,940 --> 00:44:53,220
I mean, listen

660
00:44:53,220 --> 00:44:55,580
old people should not drive

661
00:44:55,580 --> 00:44:57,700
cars, let alone large vans

662
00:44:57,700 --> 00:45:00,460
let alone large vans coming towards me

663
00:45:00,460 --> 00:45:06,460
Listen, when you're turning, you're not supposed to turn into the oncoming traffic, you're supposed to turn into, you know, traffic going the same way.

664
00:45:06,460 --> 00:45:09,460
So, I don't like you looking at me and all of a sudden,

665
00:45:09,460 --> 00:45:11,460
Oh, I'm not supposed to turn in that lane where there's a car!

666
00:45:11,460 --> 00:45:13,460
But yeah.

667
00:45:13,460 --> 00:45:19,460
So, yeah, an F.U. for me, missing, uh, stupid, uh, raffle in Animal Crossing.

668
00:45:22,460 --> 00:45:24,460
My girlfriend, she was burning my game.

669
00:45:26,460 --> 00:45:27,460
My turn, my turn?

670
00:45:27,460 --> 00:45:28,460
Yeah.

671
00:45:28,460 --> 00:45:29,460
Alright, yay!

672
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:32,960
As of this week, I have a new F.U. theme.

673
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:35,460
I've ditched Pequod for something much better.

674
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:38,960
Dancer, ladies and gentlemen, coming to F.U. theme.

675
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:39,960
Because I love this song.

676
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:41,460
And actually, Tal suggested it.

677
00:45:41,460 --> 00:45:43,460
Dude, this song is like the fucking shit.

678
00:45:43,460 --> 00:45:47,460
I mean, my Uber, golf, industrial head roommate sits there and like,

679
00:45:47,460 --> 00:45:50,960
Oh my god, if DDR had more songs like this instead of that fucking Poppy shit,

680
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:51,960
I'd play it all day and night.

681
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:53,960
Anyway, can I get my F.U.s? Thank you.

682
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:55,460
My F.U.s are actually Bomani-related.

683
00:45:55,460 --> 00:45:56,960
Well, I have one Bomani-related F.U.

684
00:45:56,960 --> 00:45:58,960
Because coming back from the Milpitas tournament,

685
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:00,960
which we'll get to the coverage of in a little bit.

686
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:07,960
Whoever built that merge where 680 and 80 meet,

687
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:09,960
fuck you.

688
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:14,960
Whoever designed it a two-lane freeway should have to merge three times

689
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:18,960
to get back on the 80, causing traffic to back up for like five miles.

690
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:21,960
Dude, you're a cunt, and I don't like you.

691
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:24,960
Dude, you take the fucking exit that takes you by South Scandia

692
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:26,960
to A if you want, you can stop there,

693
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:28,960
but B, you can get back onto the highway and skip that whole-

694
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:30,460
This is the problem, Tal.

695
00:46:30,460 --> 00:46:33,960
Everybody knows about that, so it's not much better.

696
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:35,960
That is true.

697
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:39,960
Anyway, so F whoever built that.

698
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:43,960
Puppy! Why aren't you playing Animal Crossing?

699
00:46:43,960 --> 00:46:45,960
Oh, because you're coming to do the F-U's?

700
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:47,960
Oh, you okay, Ryan?

701
00:46:47,960 --> 00:46:50,960
F Ryan for ruining my chair?

702
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:59,840
I'm putting you back in the closet where you belong, Ryan.

703
00:46:59,840 --> 00:47:05,520
I have more FUs, I'm trying to think of them.

704
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:10,120
F Tom Nook, because he was giving away crappy shit in the Animal Crossing raffle yesterday.

705
00:47:10,120 --> 00:47:13,680
F people who don't like Animal Crossing.

706
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:15,680
Starting with Tao.

707
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:19,680
Yeah, Rob, it's called Fuck. Stay with me.

708
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:22,680
Fuck!

709
00:47:22,680 --> 00:47:24,680
Is that a promise, Jamie?

710
00:47:24,680 --> 00:47:30,680
Oh my god, that would make a great special episode about Auradon, wouldn't it?

711
00:47:30,680 --> 00:47:32,680
Uh, and then, um...

712
00:47:32,680 --> 00:47:35,680
F the fact that I still can't get a date. That sucks.

713
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:37,680
Fuck that!

714
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:39,680
Fuck that no one will fuck me!

715
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:40,680
Fuck that!

716
00:47:40,680 --> 00:47:42,680
Alright, I'm done.

717
00:47:42,680 --> 00:47:45,680
Alright, Tal, you have so much to say, let's hear it.

718
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:49,680
Actually, you know what? I don't really need to give an F you, because I can just hit and rant on my live journal.

719
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:52,680
And like, people can like, not read it because I post so much.

720
00:47:52,680 --> 00:47:55,680
You know, F my fucking nature to talk so goddamn much.

721
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:57,680
It gets so annoying to other people, doesn't it?

722
00:47:57,680 --> 00:47:58,680
Fuck.

723
00:47:58,680 --> 00:47:59,680
Fuck that shit, man.

724
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:02,680
No, F the fucking Counter-Strike guy for fucking...

725
00:48:02,680 --> 00:48:03,680
Yeah.

726
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:04,680
Fuck that shit, man.

727
00:48:04,680 --> 00:48:07,680
But yeah, you guys have all heard the Counter-Strike song, right?

728
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:09,680
Where the dude is like, being liked by his buddy.

729
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:10,680
Uh, we're gonna hear it later.

730
00:48:10,680 --> 00:48:20,920
greatest call ever but it's my cage man picture tonight actually what I'd like

731
00:48:20,920 --> 00:48:25,540
to have unlicensed drivers because like my mom was in an accident the other day

732
00:48:25,540 --> 00:48:29,640
because she was like rear-ended by some fucker without a license and because it's

733
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:33,480
in a rental car we got even more shit and so f rental companies are being dicks

734
00:48:33,480 --> 00:48:37,600
and then like you know f logs in the road and like f random people who are

735
00:48:37,600 --> 00:48:41,600
I'm just hideous and like f-fucking the f-word and the f-letter.

736
00:48:41,600 --> 00:48:44,600
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck. I just made up the music.

737
00:48:44,600 --> 00:48:47,600
Yes. Fuck the f-letter in the opposite.

738
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:50,600
Fuck the Daredevil movie for being gay.

739
00:48:52,600 --> 00:48:53,600
Oh my god.

740
00:48:53,600 --> 00:48:58,600
Fuck them for having a cracker-ass Elektra.

741
00:48:58,600 --> 00:49:00,600
hahahahahaha

742
00:49:00,600 --> 00:49:02,600
it's so...

743
00:49:02,600 --> 00:49:04,600
dude

744
00:49:04,600 --> 00:49:06,600
you know the only thing that would make that movie cool

745
00:49:06,600 --> 00:49:08,600
is if they had kept fighting

746
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:12,600
cause kevin smith can take any piece of crap and make it cool

747
00:49:12,600 --> 00:49:16,600
like scary movie 3 which is happening by the way

748
00:49:16,600 --> 00:49:18,600
right

749
00:49:18,600 --> 00:49:20,600
oh they already did that

750
00:49:20,600 --> 00:49:22,600
didn't they do like

751
00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:24,600
oh, oh no

752
00:49:24,600 --> 00:49:27,600
It was, uh, Scream 3 that had Jay and Silent Bob in it.

753
00:49:28,600 --> 00:49:29,600
Who?

754
00:49:29,600 --> 00:49:32,600
As I said, Scream 3 had Jay and Silent Bob.

755
00:49:33,600 --> 00:49:35,600
Yes, they were in the background, getting in the line.

756
00:49:35,600 --> 00:49:36,600
I hate Jay and Silent Bob.

757
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:41,600
Dude, fuck Jay and Silent Bob, man.

758
00:49:41,600 --> 00:49:43,600
They're the fucking worst parts of those damn movies.

759
00:49:43,600 --> 00:49:47,600
I mean, I like all the rest of them, but I really hate Jay and Silent Bob.

760
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:50,600
They're such dicks, I hate them. I don't know how people can watch that shit.

761
00:49:50,600 --> 00:49:52,600
Not gonna do a shout.

762
00:49:52,600 --> 00:49:57,600
Actually, I'm going home anyway, so it was nice talking to you guys, um, about you, but

763
00:49:57,600 --> 00:49:59,600
I can't hear you either.

764
00:49:59,600 --> 00:50:01,600
Great, who's gonna talk now?

765
00:50:01,600 --> 00:50:04,600
Well, I'm sure you'll figure out some way to fill three hours.

766
00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:08,600
Bye, Tal. Thanks for coming. Happy birthday. Everybody sing to Tal.

767
00:50:08,600 --> 00:50:12,600
Happy birthday, fuck you.

768
00:50:12,600 --> 00:50:15,600
Happy birthday, fuck you.

769
00:50:15,600 --> 00:50:20,600
Happy birthday, fuck you, Tal.

770
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:27,440
fuck you too. Happy birthday, fuck you. Alright, get out. Oh yes, and I do expect presents

771
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:33,800
on my birthday, to say no. Bitch, you're getting all the shit for free. Alright. Here we go.

772
00:50:33,800 --> 00:50:38,520
Yes, the thought that counts. Moving along, uh, let's get to Black Lab, because I have

773
00:50:38,520 --> 00:50:42,440
this song queued up already, so, you have any, I'm sure, need I ask if Puppy has any

774
00:50:42,440 --> 00:50:49,440
F's of the week? Oh yes, you don't need to ask me. Let's see, first of all, a big, large,

775
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:51,440
FUCK YOU!

776
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:23,440
The wind thing. So many people do it against it, and that's not the way you do it.

777
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:25,440
Cut more...

778
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:27,440
Anyway, yeah, anyway, sorry.

779
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:29,440
We don't want Puppy to kill himself.

780
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:33,440
Let's see, um...

781
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:35,440
Actually, I was trying to craft something.

782
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:39,440
Fuck sudden hailstorms, because I was...

783
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:41,440
Yesterday...

784
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:43,440
Loki, shut up, I'm trying to talk.

785
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:45,440
Would you... You can't...

786
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:47,440
Yeah, you're distracting me.

787
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:51,440
Wait, I'm still trying to continue doing this.

788
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:53,440
We don't want to talk about suicide!

789
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:57,440
Go kill yourselves and I'll take over this show.

790
00:52:02,440 --> 00:52:04,440
Uh, no thank you.

791
00:52:08,440 --> 00:52:10,440
I can run.

792
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:13,440
It will be much closer to you.

793
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:20,440
I'm going to kick you.

794
00:52:20,440 --> 00:52:23,440
Down, boy.

795
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:26,440
Look at my ass, no.

796
00:52:26,440 --> 00:52:29,440
No, not my ass.

797
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:31,440
Okay, I have bug cat.

798
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:37,440
No, don't get it.

799
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:39,440
Get puppy.

800
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:41,440
Bug cat here.

801
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:57,440
Okay, um, as I was saying earlier, fuck sudden hailstorms because I was riding home from Del Taco on my bike, and as I was going over the overpass, over 80, on my bike, it starts to fucking hail, like probably nickel-sized hailstones.

802
00:52:58,440 --> 00:53:03,440
Just kidding, I fucking hurt! I had to bail underneath a gas station.

803
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:05,440
That was like why you called Mike Tyson's assistant.

804
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:06,440
What?

805
00:53:06,440 --> 00:53:09,440
Is that why you didn't speak to him? Oh, that's why you called him.

806
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:11,440
I know how

807
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:13,440
just talking about

808
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:15,440
her

809
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:17,440
I have absolutely no clue what she was talking about

810
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:19,440
um

811
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:21,440
you're a dork

812
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:23,440
you're an animator

813
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:25,440
I'm a nerd

814
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:27,440
yeah

815
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:29,440
um

816
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:31,440
yeah I'm done

817
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:33,440
fuck not having more episodes

818
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:35,440
I'm an angsty

819
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:40,560
Alright, I just got a couple quick ones.

820
00:53:40,560 --> 00:53:44,120
Number one, fuck you to my DVD player for not letting me play vulgar.

821
00:53:44,120 --> 00:53:49,600
I have been waiting forever to get a hold of that DVD if my DVD player is dying.

822
00:53:49,600 --> 00:53:53,600
Another one, fuck you to evil once again who can't drive.

823
00:53:53,600 --> 00:53:57,640
I'm on my way walking here and a guy can't wait long enough to cross the road so he doesn't

824
00:53:57,640 --> 00:53:59,640
get my inches for trying to kill me.

825
00:53:59,640 --> 00:54:01,640
Because, you know, he's going there.

826
00:54:01,640 --> 00:54:03,640
He's some little ghetto boy or whatever.

827
00:54:03,640 --> 00:54:10,640
And another one, lucky to all the jocks who have to make fun of everybody who plays DDR, I'm really getting sick and tired of it.

828
00:54:10,640 --> 00:54:23,640
Yes, the other day I was over in Tandywood with DDR and some nice, good, good football player guys got on there and threw me straight off the pad just to make fun of them.

829
00:54:23,640 --> 00:54:25,640
That's when you kick them in the balls.

830
00:54:25,640 --> 00:54:28,640
I can't run that fast.

831
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:30,640
They will attack you. They will attack you.

832
00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:31,640
That's the deal.

833
00:54:33,640 --> 00:54:34,640
He brought me balls.

834
00:54:35,640 --> 00:54:36,640
That's all I got, so.

835
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:41,640
No, what you do is stand here and you freaking tell them what happened and they will throw their ass out.

836
00:54:41,640 --> 00:54:42,640
Alright, Jonas.

837
00:54:42,640 --> 00:54:43,640
It's stand here, they will.

838
00:54:43,640 --> 00:54:47,640
Jonas just got here, so we're gonna go ahead and let him do FUs, cause he brought balls.

839
00:54:47,640 --> 00:54:50,640
Jonas, you gotta keep it quick this week.

840
00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:51,640
I've never had balls.

841
00:54:51,640 --> 00:54:54,640
Let's just say, sorry for anybody who wants to hear any more FUs.

842
00:54:54,640 --> 00:54:55,640
I don't have any today.

843
00:54:55,640 --> 00:54:56,640
What?

844
00:54:56,640 --> 00:55:03,640
What? You mean you're in a good mood? What's this about?

845
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:05,520
Thank you for the balls. We appreciate it.

846
00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:08,520
F you to stupid people, I believe. Three out of four babies should be thrown into a woodchipper.

847
00:55:08,520 --> 00:55:09,880
Alright.

848
00:55:09,880 --> 00:55:12,040
Oh, shit. Here we go.

849
00:55:12,040 --> 00:55:14,520
Well, since I missed the deadline,

850
00:55:14,520 --> 00:55:16,920
fuck school for costing me two.

851
00:55:16,920 --> 00:55:23,920
Get the whole bunch of delay.

852
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:25,920
Yeah

853
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:30,300
Don't all right chat room at use time here we go

854
00:55:30,300 --> 00:55:36,000
I'm gonna run through these really fast because I've seen there's more chat room at use tonight than I've ever seen before

855
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,500
So we got to run through these. All right kids. Here we go

856
00:55:39,160 --> 00:55:43,920
Starting off stuff. Oh my god, I continued a few to his ex

857
00:55:44,280 --> 00:55:48,880
Maybe she find nothing but sorrow and pain in the arms of others. Yes, my own personal curse there next

858
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:53,200
I want to send an F you to Megan you little fucking bitch die already also like to further the F you with an F

859
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:56,200
F you to myself, fuck me for being so hung up on my ex. Save me, somebody.

860
00:55:56,200 --> 00:55:59,200
Sucks balls because I think it might have been going to hell.

861
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:00,200
Alright.

862
00:56:02,200 --> 00:56:05,200
F you to politicians as a whole. Gray Davis especially deserves to die.

863
00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:11,200
Secondly, government headquarters in Sac sucks ass, they make things so hard for me to get my job with sudden rule fucking changes.

864
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:15,200
I also wanted to send F you to everyone that thinks what happened yesterday was terrorism.

865
00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:17,200
The shuttle was under huge security before and during launch.

866
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:30,400
So, F that. Okay. 23rd Magus says, F you to gangsta rap fans with no taste in music. I

867
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:35,280
played maybe two tack songs the whole time. Let's review the rules the crowd used. One,

868
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:39,240
if you play anything with a guitar in it anywhere in the song, you get mobbed by gangsta rap fans.

869
00:56:39,240 --> 00:56:44,000
Two, if you play anything with a synthesizer in it anywhere in the song, you get mobbed by gangsta

870
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:49,000
Three, if you play anything without lyrics, you get mobbed by gangster rap fans.

871
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:50,000
Oh, but it gets a lot better.

872
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:55,000
Four, if you play anything done by a white guy, you get mobbed by gangster rap fans.

873
00:56:55,000 --> 00:57:01,000
If you play old-school rap, MC Hammerster Mix-A-Lot, you know when rap was good, you get mobbed by gangster rap fans.

874
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:07,000
Seven, if you play anything without a drum track, everyone mobs you.

875
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:10,000
Anyway, moving right along.

876
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,000
Dark Tetsuya says, fuck being single.

877
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:13,000
Amen.

878
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:23,000
DCB says, fuck you to EX's Random for making me freestyle his secret rendezvous during the Milpitas tournament.

879
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:29,000
And uh, fuck you to Loki for making fun of Keith from American Idol says DCB.

880
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:33,000
I'm sorry?

881
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:36,000
What was the piece called? The DCP-21?

882
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:08,600
named J.C., I believe. I don't know, I wasn't there, I was my newbie. We'll talk about movies

883
00:58:08,600 --> 00:58:13,680
in a bit. Let's finish up interviews. Moving right along, Yossfibi says, fuck you to NASA

884
00:58:13,680 --> 00:58:21,160

00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:29,960
that drives the wrong way in parking lots with angle parking.

887
00:58:29,960 --> 00:58:32,960
That's why I woke up at, like, 1.30 in the afternoon.

888
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:36,960
Look at my Yahoo go, oh fuck, my live channel's gonna be going to shit.

889
00:58:36,960 --> 00:58:42,960
Moomahimer says, fuck my idiot friends, you cannot keep his damn mouth shut about every little thing anymore.

Tells him he should go die. Fuck Smarties for being so addicting.

891
00:58:45,960 --> 00:58:48,960
Smarties? Smarties are the shit. The blue ones, especially?

892
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:51,960
They make you bark, Jamie?

893
00:58:51,960 --> 00:58:55,960
Whatever.

894
00:58:55,960 --> 00:59:01,960
Fuck Bomberman Online for not only being addicting, but completely in Japanese, which makes playing adventures ten times scarier.

895
00:59:01,960 --> 00:59:11,960
Fuck this dude at my school's basketball game who tried to beat up two of my teachers. He definitely should die and yay for GCHS. I second that being single. Fuck you.

897
00:59:19,960 --> 00:59:28,960
SnubDysphonoid says fuck you to the sick fuck who made the extreme dropout edit for making it way too fucking hard. Is that you looking?

898
00:59:28,960 --> 00:59:32,760
No, that you can blame the Fifth Mix databank for that one.

899
00:59:32,760 --> 00:59:35,400
Fifth Mix at a databank, fuck that.

900
00:59:35,400 --> 00:59:37,540
Fuck you to the people who stole my wallet.

00:59:40,800 --> 00:59:42,220

I couldn't make it to Tal's party at Scandia today.

909
01:00:04,660 --> 01:00:07,980
It's okay because everybody got there like 3 hours late and there really wasn't a party.

910
01:00:07,980 --> 01:00:08,980
We're all here now.

911

01:00:29,860 --> 01:00:31,900
Plus, I have to pay for driver's ed classes,

923
01:00:31,900 --> 01:00:33,620

and MRC wouldn't tell me.

928
01:00:40,740 --> 01:00:42,580
And finally, I'd just like to wish everyone out there

929
01:00:42,580 --> 01:00:43,820
a happy Chinese New Year.

930
01:00:45,940 --> 01:00:48,940

Um, you know, um, what you just pointed out was really cool.

934
01:01:01,680 --> 01:01:05,680
False bottles should be used in porn.

935
01:01:05,680 --> 01:01:06,680
Alright.

936
01:01:06,680 --> 01:01:08,680

That brings an end to the FUs of the Week segment, so how you doing, Jonas?

Anything you want to say tonight?

944
01:01:19,680 --> 01:01:24,960
Well, I was supposed to bring Bombay here today, but I'm not so sure where he was yet.

He'll be here another show.

947
01:01:29,080 --> 01:01:31,500
He was pretty much supposed to be everywhere, all weekend.

948
01:01:31,500 --> 01:01:35,860
He was supposed to be at Scandy the other day, he was there for like a half-hour, and he was supposed to be there at 9, he left.

949
01:01:35,860 --> 01:01:40,120
He was... he's mostly out with Shane or something, and now I don't know where he is.

950
01:01:40,120 --> 01:01:44,100
He was supposed to go home today, but he didn't, because he lives in my house and stuff, but.

951
01:01:44,100 --> 01:01:47,000
He just like... he never showed up, so I don't know what he's doing right now.

Far away on the other side

985
01:03:30,920 --> 01:03:33,920
She was gone in the middle of the distance

986
01:03:33,920 --> 01:03:37,920
But she couldn't find how to push through

987
01:03:37,920 --> 01:03:40,920
She fell asleep in the evening

988
01:03:40,920 --> 01:03:44,920
Carried away by a moonlight shadow

989
01:03:44,920 --> 01:03:47,920
She sang her song when grieving

990
01:03:47,920 --> 01:03:51,920
Carried away by a moonlight shadow

991
01:03:51,920 --> 01:03:54,920
She saw what was feeling when it could come

992
01:03:54,920 --> 01:03:57,920
Far away on the other side

993
01:03:57,920 --> 01:04:01,920
He was shot six times by a man on her arm

994
01:04:01,920 --> 01:04:04,920
And she couldn't find how to push through

995
01:04:04,920 --> 01:04:08,920
I said, I said, I prayed

996
01:04:08,920 --> 01:04:11,920
I'd be in heaven one day

997
01:04:11,920 --> 01:04:15,920
Falling in the morning

998
01:04:15,920 --> 01:04:18,920
Carried away by a moonlight shed

999
01:04:18,920 --> 01:04:21,920
I watched your vision burning

1000
01:04:21,920 --> 01:04:24,920
Carried away by the moonlight

1001
01:04:24,920 --> 01:04:29,920
Shat, shat, shat, shat, shat, shat.

1002
01:04:29,920 --> 01:04:30,420
Hey!

1003
01:06:00,420 --> 01:06:13,420
Came in from the rain, it surged down on the avenue

1004
01:06:13,420 --> 01:06:20,420
Thought I heard you talking so soon

1005
01:06:20,420 --> 01:06:27,420
I turned on the lights, the TV and the radio

1006
01:06:27,420 --> 01:06:32,420
Still I can't escape the dose of you

1007
01:06:34,420 --> 01:06:37,420
What has happened to it all?

1008
01:06:37,420 --> 01:06:40,420
Crazy some say

1009
01:06:41,420 --> 01:06:46,420
Where is the life that I recognize?

1010
01:06:47,420 --> 01:06:48,420
Don't go ahead

1011
01:06:48,420 --> 01:06:52,420
But I won't cry for yesterday

1012
01:06:52,420 --> 01:07:01,420
There's an ordinary world, somehow I have to find

1013
01:07:02,420 --> 01:07:09,420
And as I try to make my way to the ordinary world

1014
01:07:09,420 --> 01:07:15,420
I will learn to survive

1015
01:07:29,420 --> 01:07:35,420
Please listen to Orange Lounge Radio, because real radio makes Captain Jack cry

1016
01:07:35,420 --> 01:07:43,380
Hey, we're not back just yet. We're going to play one more song. It was by request,

1017
01:07:43,380 --> 01:07:46,780
something from the Dance Media album. This is from Dance Media 20. It's Fei Wang, my

1018
01:07:46,780 --> 01:07:50,380
Nour. She did Eyes On Me, but she also did this song. This is a great song from Dance

1019
01:07:50,380 --> 01:07:57,380
2020 is Separate Ways here on Orange Mountain Radio.

1020
01:08:20,380 --> 01:08:21,380
My heart is rolling tonight

1021
01:08:21,380 --> 01:08:22,380
Fly away, up and away

1022
01:08:22,380 --> 01:08:23,380
I need, I know

1023
01:08:23,380 --> 01:08:24,380
This time she's all gone

1024
01:08:24,380 --> 01:08:25,380
She left from my way

1025
01:08:25,380 --> 01:08:26,380
Ooh

1026
01:08:26,380 --> 01:08:27,380
I'm not funny, I'm hidden

1027
01:08:27,380 --> 01:08:28,380
She's not really shiny at all

1028
01:08:28,380 --> 01:08:29,380
Ooh

1029
01:08:29,380 --> 01:08:30,380
Ooh

1030
01:08:30,380 --> 01:08:31,380
Ooh

1031
01:08:31,380 --> 01:08:32,380
Ooh

1032
01:08:32,380 --> 01:08:33,380
Ooh

1033
01:08:33,380 --> 01:08:34,380
Ooh

1034
01:08:34,380 --> 01:08:35,380
Ooh

1035
01:08:35,380 --> 01:08:36,380
Ooh

1036
01:08:36,380 --> 01:08:37,380
Ooh

1037
01:08:37,380 --> 01:08:38,380
Ooh

1038
01:08:38,380 --> 01:08:39,380
Ooh

1039
01:08:39,380 --> 01:08:40,380
Ooh

1040
01:08:40,380 --> 01:08:41,380
Ooh

1041
01:08:41,380 --> 01:08:42,380
Ooh

1042
01:09:12,380 --> 01:09:14,380
What's in your eyes?

1043
01:09:14,380 --> 01:09:16,880
If only no one would know

1044
01:09:16,880 --> 01:09:20,380
I would be the one who would love myself

1045
01:09:20,380 --> 01:09:22,380
Oh my god

1046
01:09:22,380 --> 01:09:25,380
Run away, open way

1047
01:09:25,380 --> 01:09:29,380
I'm not afraid of the light

1048
01:09:29,380 --> 01:09:32,380
I need, I know

1049
01:09:32,380 --> 01:09:35,380
I'm not afraid of the light

1050
01:09:35,380 --> 01:09:38,380
I'm not afraid of the light

1051
01:09:38,380 --> 01:09:41,380
I'm not afraid of the light

1052
01:09:41,380 --> 01:09:44,880
Fly away, or no way

1053
01:09:44,880 --> 01:09:48,380
You're not in a lane, I can't take you away, baby

1054
01:09:48,380 --> 01:09:51,880
I, I know

1055
01:09:51,880 --> 01:09:54,880
That there's nothing I can do

1056
01:09:54,880 --> 01:09:57,880
So I'm going to take you away

1057
01:09:57,880 --> 01:10:00,880
I'm going to take you on my way now

1058
01:10:00,880 --> 01:10:16,160
Hi-ho, Kermit the Frog here informing you that today's broadcast of Orange Lounge Radio

1059
01:10:16,160 --> 01:10:20,560
is brought to you by the letter B, the letter A, and the number 59.

1060
01:10:20,560 --> 01:10:26,000
Can you tell me how to get, how to get to Sesame Street?

1061
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:29,280
Hi everybody, you're listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

1062
01:10:29,280 --> 01:10:33,120
back and uh... if you were asking what that song was that was separate ways by

1063
01:10:33,120 --> 01:10:36,840
fay wong from decimator 20. Brad's back in the house. No that wasn't, that was the sesame

1064
01:10:36,840 --> 01:10:39,800
street song.

1065
01:10:39,800 --> 01:10:43,160
This is brad being oblivious, did you guys do the interview yet?

1066
01:10:43,160 --> 01:10:44,720
Balls!

1067
01:10:44,720 --> 01:10:47,720
Thank you for bringing it up we're gonna start those interviews right now i'm so

1068
01:10:47,720 --> 01:10:49,480
glad you asked brad

1069
01:10:49,480 --> 01:10:55,760
as you may or may not know on friday i took an adventure over till. Would you like to feel my balls?

1070
01:10:55,760 --> 01:10:58,760
Oh, you strokin' Jamie's balls live on air?

1071
01:10:58,760 --> 01:11:02,760
Can you explain the G-rated version of what balls really are?

1072
01:11:02,760 --> 01:11:06,760
Because they may not sell balls everywhere, so I need to explain what balls is.

1073
01:11:06,760 --> 01:11:09,760
Okay, I've been seeing people with this drink behind them that are moderately curious.

1074
01:11:09,760 --> 01:11:11,760
Maybe I should have Jonas plug...

1075
01:11:11,760 --> 01:11:12,760
Because he's the one that really is the master of balls.

1076
01:11:12,760 --> 01:11:14,760
I used to work at GNC...

1077
01:11:14,760 --> 01:11:18,760
A drink that has high caffeine and it's very good tasting.

1078
01:11:18,760 --> 01:11:24,760
Guarana is what they put in all of those ones with the fetters, like in those little natural weight loss things.

1079
01:11:24,760 --> 01:11:27,760
It's not necessarily caffeine, it's very like caffeine.

1080
01:11:27,760 --> 01:11:30,760
Dead or Alive Volleyball, best game ever.

1081
01:11:30,760 --> 01:11:35,760
Actually, no, it's the game that makes men act like girls.

1082
01:11:35,760 --> 01:11:36,760
And I explain this way.

1083
01:11:36,760 --> 01:11:42,760
Because they have to go shopping and buy accessories and know what their favorite colors are and their favorite foods.

1084
01:11:42,760 --> 01:11:45,760
And then they give presents to other girls.

1085
01:11:45,760 --> 01:11:47,760
Borderline dating sim.

1086
01:11:47,760 --> 01:11:49,760
It's a dating sim for lesbians.

1087
01:11:49,760 --> 01:11:51,760
Sweet.

1088
01:11:51,760 --> 01:11:53,760
It makes men act like lesbians.

1089
01:11:54,760 --> 01:11:55,760
DOA Volleyball.

1090
01:11:56,760 --> 01:12:04,760
If you like DOA, Extreme Beach Volleyball, try the upcoming game that's probably going to come out this year for the Xbox. I think it's called N.U.D.E. Act.

1091
01:12:05,760 --> 01:12:08,760
I have that BMX Triple X game. They sent it to us for free.

1092
01:12:09,760 --> 01:12:10,760
How's that game anyways?

1093
01:12:11,760 --> 01:12:17,760
Actually, as the game, it's not that bad, but it's not the best either.

1094
01:12:17,760 --> 01:12:28,760
Yeah, because Dan manages GameStop, we get all kinds of neat free video games and all kinds of cool swag.

1095
01:12:28,760 --> 01:12:34,760
Like, you know, I don't know if you saw my keychain, I have a GameCube keychain and a GBA keychain.

1096
01:12:34,760 --> 01:12:40,760
Lovely, Brad, lovely. In case people missed it, Brad belched. Anyway.

1097
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:43,760
Alright, are you guys ready to get to your rooms?

1098
01:12:43,760 --> 01:12:44,760
No.

1099
01:12:44,760 --> 01:12:45,760
Okay, Jamie.

1100
01:12:45,760 --> 01:12:50,760
But we get free games every so often, and we get, like, um, porn games, so okay.

1101
01:12:53,760 --> 01:12:54,760
Alright, you guys ready?

1102
01:12:54,760 --> 01:12:55,760
Yes!

1103
01:12:55,760 --> 01:12:59,760
Alright, here we go, we're gonna do the, uh, Milpitas Golf Land interviews. Enjoy!

1104
01:12:59,760 --> 01:13:00,760
Yay!

1105
01:13:00,760 --> 01:13:26,920
I don't know what happened at the beginning of that interview.

1106
01:13:26,920 --> 01:13:27,920
That's weird.

1107
01:13:27,920 --> 01:13:31,360
in the middle there. But we're talking to Melody, also known as SharksGirl, about Derby

1108
01:13:31,360 --> 01:13:34,760
Owners Club. That's kind of weird. She's explaining what Derby Owners Club's all about. Sorry

1109
01:13:34,760 --> 01:13:35,760
about that.

1110
01:13:35,760 --> 01:13:38,320
You say, I want to do it again. And if you lose, you say, I have to do it again, because

1111
01:13:38,320 --> 01:13:41,320
I have to win. And suddenly, you're down a hundred bucks.

1112
01:13:41,320 --> 01:13:44,400
I won a race earlier, and I nearly wet my pants. I was so excited.

1113
01:13:44,400 --> 01:13:46,600
Yeah, and you beat me.

1114
01:13:46,600 --> 01:13:52,520
I'm sorry, but I beat my horse more than I beat you, if that's any consolation.

1115
01:13:52,520 --> 01:13:53,520
Well, I...

1116
01:13:53,520 --> 01:13:54,520
Leave the beating to somebody else.

1117
01:13:54,520 --> 01:13:59,200
I guess I'll forgive you for that and I'm just going to leave that comment right alone.

1118
01:13:59,200 --> 01:14:00,200
You're so kind.

1119
01:14:00,200 --> 01:14:02,520
Oh, isn't there some DDR thing going on here today, too?

1120
01:14:02,520 --> 01:14:03,520
A DDR tournament?

1121
01:14:03,520 --> 01:14:04,520
What's that?

1122
01:14:04,520 --> 01:14:07,320
Oh, yeah, there's a DDR tournament going on in the other room.

1123
01:14:07,320 --> 01:14:11,240
Is that why you're here tonight or are you going to be participating in anything or are

1124
01:14:11,240 --> 01:14:12,800
you just here to cheer people on?

1125
01:14:12,800 --> 01:14:14,280
I'm just kind of here to watch.

1126
01:14:14,280 --> 01:14:19,160
This time I'm not doing anything, not going to do that for a little while, but yeah, I

1127
01:14:19,160 --> 01:14:22,440
just kind of wanted to see what's going on and catch more extreme because I still haven't

1128
01:14:22,440 --> 01:14:24,000
heard many of the songs on it.

1129
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:27,000
I think that's pretty much me too. You know, if you listen to Orange Lounge from

1130
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:31,000
Lonnie Music and More, I'm gonna hear lots of stuff from Extreme. Wink, wink, nudge, nudge, plug.

1131
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:36,000
Well, you know, I kind of have this little thing called a life that really keeps me going.

1132
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:38,000
Hey, hey! I don't like where you're going with that, missy.

1133
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:42,000
Okay, well how about this? I have a really slow freaking connection.

1134
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:47,000
Okay, fair enough. Fine, be that way. Fine, we understand.

1135
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:50,000
I don't want to talk to you no more. Let's talk to this person sitting across the table. Say hello.

1136
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:51,000
Hi.

1137
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:52,000
What's your name?

1138
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:53,000
Uh, Ron.

1139
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:55,000
And do you have an online name that you buy?

1140
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:57,000
Uke Bondage Boy.

1141
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:59,000
Right on. What brings you to today's lovely tournament?

1142
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:02,000
Being cheerleader for Myaniki.

1143
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:04,000
Right on. So you're not going to be participating?

1144
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:07,000
Are you going to get up there and actually cheerlead while there's a routine going on?

1145
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:09,000
No.

1146
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:11,000
Do you think Para Para is anything like cheerleading?

1147
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:13,000
Somewhat, yeah.

1148
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:15,000
Do you own any boots?

1149
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:17,000
Boots?

1150
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:19,000
Yeah, you don't like Para Para boots? The big silver boots that come up to your knees?

1151
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:22,000
No, I have big black boots with lots of buckles.

1152
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:28,200
That's where you go hence the name bondage. Yep. Why do you go by bondage boy? There's just you like

1153
01:15:29,080 --> 01:15:33,000
It was actually a joke because most people when I talk to them online

1154
01:15:33,040 --> 01:15:38,520
I don't tell them that I'm female right away because a lot of yaoi fans are female and

1155
01:15:39,080 --> 01:15:44,440
They're all into the whole female female relationship. So I don't need any extra baggage like that

1156
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:49,520
So you're into the yaoi? Yeah. Oh, yes. So is the lovely Jamie who couldn't be here tonight?

1157
01:15:49,520 --> 01:15:54,760
I'm sure I'm sure you two could talk about yaoi all night long. We often do right on. Yes. Yes

1158
01:15:55,280 --> 01:15:59,640
What's your favorite yaoi? Um, I don't have a favorite right now

1159
01:15:59,640 --> 01:16:04,000
I'm like really into xeno gears because I just started playing it and initial D

1160
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:10,380
Initial D. What if they did like initial D yaoi that's like kind of role-playing would that be like the shit?

1161
01:16:10,380 --> 01:16:16,960
Oh, I already kind of do that. Oh right on cool. Well anything else you want to say to lovely listeners of orange launch radio?

1162
01:16:16,960 --> 01:16:22,960
Have fun listening. I can't listen. My computer doesn't like streaming.

1163
01:16:22,960 --> 01:16:25,960
That's okay. We forgive you. But thanks for being on the show.

1164
01:16:25,960 --> 01:16:26,960
Not a problem.

1165
01:16:26,960 --> 01:16:32,960
Cool. Also joining us, we're joined by a few good men here at the table. Say hello everybody.

1166
01:16:32,960 --> 01:16:37,960
I hope he doesn't mind me shoving the microphone in his face. It's Mr. Wendell.

1167
01:16:37,960 --> 01:16:41,960
You just say that so erotically.

1168
01:16:41,960 --> 01:16:47,960
I was coming off a yaoi high. What can I say? I said coming.

1169
01:16:47,960 --> 01:16:52,360
Oh, you make my nipples so hard now.

1170
01:16:52,360 --> 01:16:55,080
So are you going to be participating in today's tournament?

1171
01:16:55,080 --> 01:16:57,600
I will participate,

1172
01:16:57,600 --> 01:17:02,080
albeit not necessarily be all that great, but hey, hey, that worked.

1173
01:17:02,080 --> 01:17:06,120
Yeah, I'll either improv freestyle just for the heck of it, you know.

1174
01:17:06,120 --> 01:17:09,720
And I'm sure it'll be fun. Now how do you approach improv freestyle as opposed to

1175
01:17:09,720 --> 01:17:13,000
routine freestyle, with the obvious exception of you don't really plan in advance. Do you

1176
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:15,920
go in a different mindset when you get up there?

1177
01:17:15,920 --> 01:17:21,120
You never really know what song you're going to get. You just got to go with what you got,

1178
01:17:21,120 --> 01:17:22,120
try to do what you can.

1179
01:17:22,120 --> 01:17:25,200
Everybody says he gets baby, baby loves me.

1180
01:17:25,200 --> 01:17:28,280
Let's hear that comment for the listeners.

1181
01:17:28,280 --> 01:17:30,040
I fucking forgot, so.

1182
01:17:30,040 --> 01:17:31,040
And who are you good, sir?

1183
01:17:31,040 --> 01:17:33,040
I want that one, Bobby!

1184
01:17:33,040 --> 01:17:37,400
Shut up, dude. That's a hella cool name. Fuzzy Hat. Hello, Fuzzy Hat. What brings you to

1185
01:17:37,400 --> 01:17:38,400
today's tournament?

1186
01:17:38,400 --> 01:17:43,400
It's either this or go to Dave & Buster's.

1187
01:17:43,400 --> 01:17:47,400
Oh, you're here for Derby Owners Club too then?

1188
01:17:47,400 --> 01:17:50,400
No, I get Derby Owners Club for free at Dave & Buster's.

1189
01:17:50,400 --> 01:17:52,400
Oh, I see.

1190
01:17:52,400 --> 01:17:57,400
Are you going to be participating in improv too?

1191
01:17:57,400 --> 01:17:58,400
Yeah.

1192
01:17:58,400 --> 01:18:01,400
Well now what happens if you get Baby Baby Love Me?

1193
01:18:01,400 --> 01:18:04,400
It'll be hella awesome.

1194
01:18:04,400 --> 01:18:06,400
Will it be erotic and sensuous?

1195
01:18:06,400 --> 01:18:08,400
No, it'll just be hella awesome.

1196
01:18:08,400 --> 01:18:10,400
Sounds good.

1197
01:18:10,400 --> 01:18:14,400
Well, good luck to you both.

1198
01:18:14,400 --> 01:18:15,400
Good luck.

1199
01:18:15,400 --> 01:18:19,400
Also, over here, let's say hello to an old favorite of the show as well.

1200
01:18:19,400 --> 01:18:22,400
Say hello to Moby.

1201
01:18:22,400 --> 01:18:24,400
Howdy.

1202
01:18:24,400 --> 01:18:26,400
And what brings you to today's tournament?

1203
01:18:26,400 --> 01:18:28,400
Um, intrigue.

1204
01:18:28,400 --> 01:18:34,400
It's just kind of interesting to see, after all the ranting and raving there's been going on between preparedness and improv routines,

1205
01:18:34,400 --> 01:18:39,400
There's a competition catered to the improv kind.

1206
01:18:39,400 --> 01:18:42,400
So do you think something like this was needed for the community?

1207
01:18:42,400 --> 01:18:50,400
I think improv is, you know, it's just as important to freestyle as it is, as prepared routines are.

1208
01:18:50,400 --> 01:18:53,400
There are some people who prefer the former over the latter.

1209
01:18:53,400 --> 01:18:57,400
There are some who think that, you know, someone who has a raw talent should be able to win every turn in.

1210
01:18:57,400 --> 01:19:02,400
This is one for just, one for argument's sake if nothing else.

1211
01:19:02,400 --> 01:19:04,400
So you're not going to be participating, though?

1212
01:19:04,400 --> 01:19:10,400
Oh, I would, but it's like, I've got to save my goods up for the CBN coming up in a couple weeks,

1213
01:19:10,400 --> 01:19:16,400
and it's like, if I blow my wad now, I'll be shooting blanks at CBN, and then, you know, what happens there?

1214
01:19:16,400 --> 01:19:18,400
Heaven forbid, Mel Blanc.

1215
01:19:18,400 --> 01:19:21,400
Yeah, that's what the beat will stand for.

1216
01:19:21,400 --> 01:19:23,400
Gee.

1217
01:19:23,400 --> 01:19:26,400
That's all, folks!

1218
01:19:26,400 --> 01:19:28,400
On that note, I think this interview is going to come to a close,

1219
01:19:28,400 --> 01:19:31,680
But do you guys have any final thoughts, anything you guys want to say to listeners, Orange

1220
01:19:31,680 --> 01:19:32,680
Arms?

1221
01:19:32,680 --> 01:19:39,400
Yeah, go out there, have some fun, and where's the beer?

1222
01:19:39,400 --> 01:19:40,400
Where is the beer?

1223
01:19:40,400 --> 01:19:41,800
That's a very good question.

1224
01:19:41,800 --> 01:19:47,720
Jamie's, the lovely Dark Sacra, who couldn't be here tonight, unfortunately, is going to

1225
01:19:47,720 --> 01:19:50,080
be getting drunk on the show, I believe, the next week's show.

1226
01:19:50,080 --> 01:19:52,680
I'm away at Cyber Beat Nation, she's going to help me get drunk.

1227
01:19:52,680 --> 01:19:59,680
I love you, Dr. Gura! You should have been here!

1228
01:19:59,680 --> 01:20:01,680
Wait, Jamie wanted to interrupt and say something.

1229
01:20:01,680 --> 01:20:06,680
Um, I will be getting drunk, and Shucksco will be getting drunk with me.

1230
01:20:06,680 --> 01:20:07,680
Word.

1231
01:20:07,680 --> 01:20:12,680
And our static problem got worse, God damn it, our static problem.

1232
01:20:12,680 --> 01:20:21,680
I won't be getting drunk, I don't think, because I don't drink, and I'm kind of afraid to drink because since I'd be such a lightweight, you know, getting sick and then possibly violent, you know, who knows?

1233
01:20:21,680 --> 01:20:22,680
Who knows?

1234
01:20:22,680 --> 01:20:24,680
You're going to be around two drunk women.

1235
01:20:24,680 --> 01:20:25,680
Yes.

1236
01:20:25,680 --> 01:20:27,680
We're going to be laughing our asses off.

1237
01:20:27,680 --> 01:20:30,680
Too bad there's no attraction or anything or you could be in the middle of a lesbian

1238
01:20:30,680 --> 01:20:31,680
sandwich.

1239
01:20:31,680 --> 01:20:32,680
No!

1240
01:20:32,680 --> 01:20:34,680
Alright, back to the interviews.

1241
01:20:34,680 --> 01:20:35,680
Hi.

1242
01:20:35,680 --> 01:20:36,680
Hi.

1243
01:20:36,680 --> 01:20:41,160
It's called work and it's evil.

1244
01:20:41,160 --> 01:20:43,200
Any final thoughts from LB?

1245
01:20:43,200 --> 01:20:47,660
RTF World Domination, give us your finest meats and cheeses.

1246
01:20:47,660 --> 01:20:49,320
Any final words from Sharks Girl?

1247
01:20:49,320 --> 01:20:50,680
Say no to Derby owner crack.

1248
01:20:50,680 --> 01:20:53,880
And even though I already asked her anything from bondage boy, um

1249
01:20:54,640 --> 01:20:57,420
Not really. I love your hair by the way. Thank you

1250
01:20:59,160 --> 01:21:01,160
It's more felicious, yeah

1251
01:21:01,960 --> 01:21:03,960
All right more interviews to come later

1252
01:21:04,480 --> 01:21:10,560
And now and now joining us at the table the ever so lovely tonight's introduce yourself kind lady

1253
01:21:10,800 --> 01:21:13,520
Hi, I'm Jenny bean. What's up, everyone?

1254
01:21:13,520 --> 01:21:16,520
How are you doing tonight? What brings you to Milvitas tonight?

1255
01:21:16,520 --> 01:21:18,520
The wonderful tournament that Milton's running.

1256
01:21:18,520 --> 01:21:21,520
Right on. Are you going to be participating? Are you judging? Or what's going on?

1257
01:21:21,520 --> 01:21:22,520
I'm judging.

1258
01:21:22,520 --> 01:21:27,520
Ooh. Now, okay. I haven't talked to a judge yet. What are you going to be looking for in tonight's improv?

1259
01:21:27,520 --> 01:21:36,520
Guys, I don't know. It's harder to judge improv, I think. But, um, I don't know. I'm just looking for a good flow of routines and all that. The normal stuff.

1260
01:21:36,520 --> 01:21:41,520
Now, I know you can't play favorites. Was there any particular person you're looking forward to seeing do an improv routine?

1261
01:21:41,520 --> 01:21:46,560
team? Not really. Actually, I guess Fuzzy Hat, because I like his improv routines. I

1262
01:21:46,560 --> 01:21:50,200
think he's pretty good at it. He does some pretty good shit. We're hoping he gets Baby

1263
01:21:50,200 --> 01:21:55,360
Baby Love Me. That would be cool! Anything else you want to say to the listeners of Orange

1264
01:21:55,360 --> 01:21:59,360
Lawns Radio? And Dark Sakura and Loki, they're in the studio, couldn't be here tonight. Well,

1265
01:21:59,360 --> 01:22:06,440
hello to all of them, and hello to everyone who's listening. Any words of wisdom for Bimani

1266
01:22:06,440 --> 01:22:13,440
players out there, if any new people that want to start improv freestyling.

1267
01:22:14,200 --> 01:22:19,200
Watch videos. Sounds good. All right, more interviews to come.

1268
01:22:19,200 --> 01:22:26,200
All right, a little bit of time has passed and PA is over now and I had a second to step

1269
01:22:26,360 --> 01:22:30,320
outside with this fine gentleman. Introduce yourself for all the orange on the scissors.

1270
01:22:30,320 --> 01:22:33,920
I'm Milton, aka Maple, the tournament organizer of NorCal.

1271
01:22:33,920 --> 01:22:35,920
So, what made you decide to do a tournament today?

1272
01:22:36,920 --> 01:22:42,920
Extreme came out a month ago, and I promised Paul, as well as a lot of other people, that I'd throw a tournament one month after we got Extreme.

1273
01:22:43,920 --> 01:22:44,920
So, a month later, tournament.

1274
01:22:45,920 --> 01:22:46,920
How's it going? You guys happy with the turnout?

1275
01:22:47,920 --> 01:22:52,920
Turnout, yes. We didn't think it would be this many people, but then people surprised us. Last minute people come, and you know.

1276
01:22:53,920 --> 01:22:57,920
Right on. So what made you guys decide to do an improv freestyle, as opposed to the typical routine freestyle?

1277
01:22:57,920 --> 01:23:00,920
Well, honestly, out of all my tournaments, I've never ran improv.

1278
01:23:00,920 --> 01:23:02,920
It's always been routine freestyle.

1279
01:23:02,920 --> 01:23:06,920
And a person, Jason, ran, or ran on the boards as you may know,

1280
01:23:06,920 --> 01:23:10,920
he brought to my attention that, you know, there should be improv, just improv against routine.

1281
01:23:10,920 --> 01:23:13,920
So I decided to throw improv freestyle at him.

1282
01:23:13,920 --> 01:23:16,920
A lot of people entered, you know, people supported, some people didn't support it.

1283
01:23:16,920 --> 01:23:19,920
And he said, I didn't want to have a routine freestyle with CBN coming up so soon.

1284
01:23:19,920 --> 01:23:22,920
That's what a lot of people have been saying is that they're kind of glad that it didn't happen

1285
01:23:22,920 --> 01:23:24,920
because they're saving their routines for Cyberbeat.

1286
01:23:24,920 --> 01:23:25,920
So I'll be going.

1287
01:23:25,920 --> 01:23:26,920
So you're going to be going to Cyberbeat?

1288
01:23:26,920 --> 01:23:32,580
to beat? Of course. Alright, looking forward to that. So how many tournaments have you,

1289
01:23:32,580 --> 01:23:36,240
in the past year, how many tournaments have you had a hand in running, do you think? In

1290
01:23:36,240 --> 01:23:44,860
running or helping with? Both, if you can recall either. Everything from Fremont to

1291
01:23:44,860 --> 01:23:53,180
now excluding Spigle 2? Everything. I'm pretty sure, in NorCal. That's a whole lot of tournaments.

1292
01:23:53,180 --> 01:23:56,540
So wait, you haven't actually judged a tournament in a while though, that's kind of a break

1293
01:23:56,540 --> 01:24:01,540
Well, I judged MGL Evil Tournament 2, which was December 13th.

1294
01:24:01,540 --> 01:24:05,540
What kind of things do you think the judges will be looking for tonight in Improv Freestyle's poster routine freestyle?

1295
01:24:05,540 --> 01:24:12,540
Well, for freestyle, this time I have seven judges, and they're each judging a category.

1296
01:24:12,540 --> 01:24:16,540
One of them is judging on, for example, one of them is judging on energy, one of them is judging on power moves,

1297
01:24:16,540 --> 01:24:20,540
the other one is judging on aero flexibility, which is how you use aeros.

1298
01:24:20,540 --> 01:24:23,540
Any other upcoming events you want to let our listeners know about?

1299
01:24:23,540 --> 01:24:32,540
Not really, the only thing I know about is CBN in February, and then March Madness in March, and then probably B3 in May, I think May 18th and 19th, I'm pretty sure, or the weekend around there.

1300
01:24:32,540 --> 01:24:37,540
And then, as for summer, I don't know, and I think it's B3. Right, Corey?

1301
01:24:37,540 --> 01:24:38,540
Supposedly B3.

1302
01:24:38,540 --> 01:24:39,540
Supposedly B3, so why not?

1303
01:24:39,540 --> 01:24:42,540
A question mark. You heard it here first, or second, or third.

1304
01:24:43,540 --> 01:24:45,540
Anything else you want to say to listeners?

1305
01:24:46,540 --> 01:24:47,540
Okay, yes, R2 has a question for Milton.

1306
01:24:47,540 --> 01:24:51,540
What about the other 13 categories you mentioned to me earlier?

1307
01:24:51,540 --> 01:24:53,540
What do you mean by that?

1308
01:24:53,540 --> 01:24:55,540
You said you had 20?

1309
01:24:55,540 --> 01:24:57,540
Yes, but I have to cut down.

1310
01:24:57,540 --> 01:25:01,540
I don't want more judges than there are entries in the tournament.

1311
01:25:01,540 --> 01:25:03,540
I understand.

1312
01:25:03,540 --> 01:25:05,540
Dismissed?

1313
01:25:05,540 --> 01:25:11,540
I want a freestyle tournament with 5 entries and having 87 judges.

1314
01:25:11,540 --> 01:25:13,540
That'd be dope.

1315
01:25:13,540 --> 01:25:15,540
That'd be dope.

1316
01:25:15,540 --> 01:25:17,540
That's when all the judges would slam them on everything.

1317
01:25:17,540 --> 01:25:19,540
Any final thoughts for the listeners?

1318
01:25:19,540 --> 01:25:21,540
Not really.

1319
01:25:21,540 --> 01:25:24,540
Alright, thank you for joining us today.

1320
01:25:24,540 --> 01:25:25,540
No problem.

1321
01:25:25,540 --> 01:25:26,540
Good luck with the rest of the tournament.

1322
01:25:26,540 --> 01:25:27,540
Alright, thanks.

1323
01:25:27,540 --> 01:25:28,540
I'm ready.

1324
01:25:28,540 --> 01:25:29,540
Yeah.

1325
01:25:29,540 --> 01:25:32,540
Okay, so we got another interview here. Introduce yourself for our listeners.

1326
01:25:32,540 --> 01:25:33,540
Axel.

1327
01:25:33,540 --> 01:25:34,540
Yeah. Hi guys.

1328
01:25:34,540 --> 01:25:36,540
What's up? Where are you from?

1329
01:25:36,540 --> 01:25:37,540
Stockton.

1330
01:25:37,540 --> 01:25:40,540
What brings you to the Milpitas tournament this evening?

1331
01:25:40,540 --> 01:25:43,540
To see my buddy, Milton, and John, virtue.

1332
01:25:43,540 --> 01:25:44,540
Don't lie.

1333
01:25:44,540 --> 01:25:47,540
The rest of the Killer Pals and Samantha.

1334
01:25:47,540 --> 01:25:50,540
Are you participating in anything tonight? PA? Improv?

1335
01:25:50,540 --> 01:25:51,540
Yeah, I did PA.

1336
01:25:51,540 --> 01:25:52,540
How'd you do?

1337
01:25:52,540 --> 01:25:54,540
Lost fresh ground at Tigger.

1338
01:25:54,540 --> 01:25:55,540
Dope.

1339
01:25:55,540 --> 01:25:56,540
Very dope.

1340
01:25:56,540 --> 01:25:58,540
Okay, I'm off to him too.

1341
01:25:58,540 --> 01:25:59,540
What was the song?

1342
01:25:59,540 --> 01:26:01,540
Uh, what was it? It was uh...

1343
01:26:01,540 --> 01:26:02,540
I didn't play him.

1344
01:26:02,540 --> 01:26:03,540
Gentle Stress.

1345
01:26:03,540 --> 01:26:04,540
Bummer.

1346
01:26:04,540 --> 01:26:08,540
So um, what, so you're just, you're not going to be doing freestyle? You watching, or?

1347
01:26:08,540 --> 01:26:09,540
I'm leaving.

1348
01:26:09,540 --> 01:26:11,540
You're leaving?

1349
01:26:11,540 --> 01:26:15,540
Is it hard to get to, you said you were having problems getting a ride over here, or?

1350
01:26:15,540 --> 01:26:18,540
Yes, no one is willing to really take me.

1351
01:26:18,540 --> 01:26:21,540
Tell us about the DDR scene in Stockton, because we don't talk to many people from there.

1352
01:26:21,540 --> 01:26:28,540
We've talked about Stockton Golf Land on the show, because we refer to it as ghetto golf land, but...

1353
01:26:28,540 --> 01:26:30,540
It is pretty ghetto.

1354
01:26:30,540 --> 01:26:32,540
If you want to get shot, then that's the place to go.

1355
01:26:32,540 --> 01:26:34,540
Have you ever seen anyone get killed at Golf Land?

1356
01:26:34,540 --> 01:26:36,540
No, but I've witnessed a shooting.

1357
01:26:36,540 --> 01:26:38,540
Have you ever wanted to kill somebody at Golf Land?

1358
01:26:38,540 --> 01:26:39,540
Not me.

1359
01:26:39,540 --> 01:26:41,540
Those little kids are fucking mean.

1360
01:26:41,540 --> 01:26:47,540
Yeah, I know. Every day I want to kill them. They ask for tokens. I give them to them. They're intimidating.

1361
01:26:47,540 --> 01:26:49,540
Anything else you want to say for our listeners this evening?

1362
01:26:49,540 --> 01:26:51,540
Bye, guys.

1363
01:26:51,540 --> 01:26:53,540
Says it all.

1364
01:26:53,540 --> 01:26:58,540
All right, we are back with somebody who was on the show a couple weeks ago when we were at his tournament,

1365
01:26:58,540 --> 01:27:01,540
but now he's here at the Milpitas tournament. Introduce yourselves for the listeners.

1366
01:27:01,540 --> 01:27:03,540
Hi, guys. I'm DCB.

1367
01:27:03,540 --> 01:27:06,540
Hi, DCB. What brings you to Milpitas today?

1368
01:27:06,540 --> 01:27:09,540
One word. Shades.

1369
01:27:09,540 --> 01:27:12,980
That's another interview I gotta get later, if I can.

1370
01:27:12,980 --> 01:27:14,300
So, uh,

1371
01:27:14,300 --> 01:27:17,780
what kind of stuff are you doing here today? Are you participating in PA, freestyling that?

1372
01:27:17,780 --> 01:27:21,460
Uh, I was one of the three people that didn't qualify for PA.

1373
01:27:21,460 --> 01:27:23,300
Dope. Yeah, I'm that elite.

1374
01:27:23,300 --> 01:27:24,860
You're in a special club?

1375
01:27:24,860 --> 01:27:27,500
Yeah, there's like three of us, so that's cool.

1376
01:27:27,500 --> 01:27:28,980
Did you come in dead last?

1377
01:27:28,980 --> 01:27:32,080
No, I don't know, last Milton.

1378
01:27:32,080 --> 01:27:35,220
Well, that's something, at least you didn't come in last. Alright, if you did, hey,

1379
01:27:35,220 --> 01:27:36,980
last place is something.

1380
01:27:36,980 --> 01:27:39,060
So, I hear you got a joke for the listeners.

1381
01:27:39,060 --> 01:27:50,100
Knock knock. Who's there? Who's there? Bob. Bob who? Bob Saget. Oh. Oh. Ha. Ha ha. I think

1382
01:27:50,100 --> 01:27:53,440
if you were on Star Search they would have given you one star, but that's right. I'd

1383
01:27:53,440 --> 01:27:57,920
rather be on American Idol because Simon is sexy. You want to audition for American Idol

1384
01:27:57,920 --> 01:28:01,080
right now? You want to sing us something? Uh, no. Sing us something from DDR. Come on,

1385
01:28:01,080 --> 01:28:08,000
cartoon heroes. We are the killer pals. Hi guys. Explain to us, I don't think we talked

1386
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:10,380
there's a Fremont tell us about the killer pals what's the concept behind

1387
01:28:10,380 --> 01:28:14,940
killer pals and plug the website we really don't know it's just like all my

1388
01:28:14,940 --> 01:28:19,080
friends and we call ourselves the killer pals do you kill people no we don't kill

1389
01:28:19,080 --> 01:28:24,160
people we're actually nice kids and we get good grades in school and we drink

1390
01:28:24,160 --> 01:28:30,000
our milk every night I was gonna say I noticed you change from Kirk Cameron to

1391
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:35,040
Bob Saget what what brought this on Kirk Cameron was just old like he didn't want

1392
01:28:35,040 --> 01:28:41,680
be my friend anymore. But Bob Saget, he's fresh, yeah, he's cool. New ideas. Dirty Work's

1393
01:28:41,680 --> 01:28:47,160
one of my favorite movies of all time. I like Full House. Hey, did you hear the Olsen twins

1394
01:28:47,160 --> 01:28:52,720
going to college soon? I get it. That one's for you, for two. Who's your favorite Olsen

1395
01:28:52,720 --> 01:29:01,400
twin? Yeah, anyway, anything else you want to say for our listeners? I just did the shittiest

1396
01:29:01,400 --> 01:29:03,400
routine ever in the DDR tournament?

1397
01:29:03,400 --> 01:29:05,400
Can you say shimmies?

1398
01:29:05,400 --> 01:29:07,400
Yes, you can say anything you want on the fucking internet.

1399
01:29:07,400 --> 01:29:14,400
Yeah, it sucked real bad. I didn't know what I was doing. I tried popping and locking all those cool kids, but I'm too white to do it.

1400
01:29:14,400 --> 01:29:20,400
And then all the other killer pals got behind the machine and started making designs with their arms.

1401
01:29:20,400 --> 01:29:22,400
And I don't know, I was just trying not to fail the stupid song.

1402
01:29:22,400 --> 01:29:24,400
Were you leading everybody in the wave?

1403
01:29:24,400 --> 01:29:25,400
I don't know what I was doing.

1404
01:29:25,400 --> 01:29:26,400
What song did you get?

1405
01:29:26,400 --> 01:29:28,400
Secret Rendezvous.

1406
01:29:28,400 --> 01:29:30,400
Because you know we're secret lovers.

1407
01:29:30,400 --> 01:29:33,120
or is that the cause of ideal about non-state

1408
01:29:33,120 --> 01:29:36,040
between me and what's a

1409
01:29:36,040 --> 01:29:39,240
we know the same about them

1410
01:29:39,240 --> 01:29:42,160
uh... right any final any power solutions

1411
01:29:42,160 --> 01:29:43,360

because he always has something to say say hello was what the

Oh my god, it's the Max 300 guy!

1423

Yeah, um...

And DVR.

1426
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:12,000
DVR!

1427
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:14,000
And you were telling me about triple A's today?

1428
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:16,000
Yes, I have 20 heavy triple A's in two weeks.

1429
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:18,000
You're almost a Yasu level there.

1430
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:21,000
No, I'm scared of Yasu.

1431
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:23,000
What would you do if he showed up at Cyber Beat Ninja?

1432
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:25,000
I wouldn't enter.

1433
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:27,000
I'd never see you on.

1434
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:29,000
Bye guys!

1435
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:31,400
Oh, wait, say hello to our listeners. Who are you, young lady?

1436
01:30:31,400 --> 01:30:32,600
Hi, I'm Samantha.

1437
01:30:32,600 --> 01:30:36,200
Hi, Samantha. Anything you want to say? I have a fakuk shirt, too. It's one of my favorite clothing brands.

1438
01:30:36,200 --> 01:30:37,000
He loves fakuk.

1439
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:38,600
Everybody loves to fakuk.

1440
01:30:38,600 --> 01:30:39,800
I have an e-mail.

1441
01:30:41,400 --> 01:30:42,600
Well, bye!

1442
01:30:42,600 --> 01:30:43,800
Bye!

1443
01:30:43,800 --> 01:30:45,400
Hey, thanks for your two.

1444
01:30:45,400 --> 01:30:48,600
So, before I was so rudely interrupted...

1445
01:30:48,600 --> 01:30:50,200
Calm down, buddy.

1446
01:30:50,200 --> 01:30:56,200
Well, we were like, oh my god, a chick that plays DDR, so, you know, we had to break. News bulletin.

1447
01:30:56,200 --> 01:30:57,400
News bulletin, yeah.

1448
01:30:57,400 --> 01:30:58,600
Breaking news.

1449
01:30:58,600 --> 01:31:03,100
Of course, we've got DarkSakura in the studio right now and no chick who plays DTR, but you know.

1450
01:31:03,100 --> 01:31:04,800
So yes, um, do you have questions for me?

1451
01:31:04,800 --> 01:31:08,700
Do I have questions for you? Yeah, what the hell are you doing here today? You doing Perkz Attack, you doing Freestyle?

1452
01:31:08,700 --> 01:31:10,300
I'm losing to Tigger.

1453
01:31:10,300 --> 01:31:12,400
As Perkz Attack's over, you lost to Tigger? Final round?

1454
01:31:12,400 --> 01:31:13,200
Yeah.

1455
01:31:13,200 --> 01:31:14,700
What was it? What'd you have to fight him on?

1456
01:31:14,700 --> 01:31:17,200
What attack? Fucking Pollock.

1457
01:31:17,200 --> 01:31:19,500
Piece of shit, motherfucking cocksuck.

1458
01:31:19,500 --> 01:31:21,600
How bad did he beat you?

1459
01:31:21,600 --> 01:31:22,600
93 Marvelous.

1460
01:31:22,600 --> 01:31:23,600
Nope!

1461
01:31:23,600 --> 01:31:26,400
That's my guys.

1462
01:31:26,400 --> 01:31:28,400
So you're not going to be doing a freestyle today?

1463
01:31:28,400 --> 01:31:30,400
I did my freestyle with the killer pals.

1464
01:31:30,400 --> 01:31:31,400
I made a design.

1465
01:31:31,400 --> 01:31:34,400
Oh, okay. What design were you a part of?

1466
01:31:34,400 --> 01:31:36,400
I was the arm.

1467
01:31:36,400 --> 01:31:38,400
An arm.

1468
01:31:38,400 --> 01:31:40,400
Okay. So any other...

1469
01:31:40,400 --> 01:31:43,400
You know that Buddha thing that has all the weird arms and like 50 legs?

1470
01:31:43,400 --> 01:31:45,400
We made that behind the machine.

1471
01:31:45,400 --> 01:31:48,400
And the machine was the body.

1472
01:31:48,400 --> 01:31:49,400
Very interesting.

1473
01:31:49,400 --> 01:31:52,400
I just had a picture of like all the FOBs in the crowd.

1474
01:31:52,400 --> 01:31:55,400
Just like on their hands and knees worshipping Buddha.

1475
01:31:55,400 --> 01:31:58,640
But they didn't realize it was a DDR machine.

1476
01:31:58,640 --> 01:32:02,680
So it's now BBR, Buddha Buddha Revolution.

1477
01:32:02,680 --> 01:32:04,440
Did you rub its belly?

1478
01:32:04,440 --> 01:32:05,680
I fucked its belly.

1479
01:32:05,680 --> 01:32:07,640
Side note, he's going to hell.

1480
01:32:07,640 --> 01:32:08,600
Are you going to hell?

1481
01:32:08,600 --> 01:32:09,360
I'm not Filipino.

1482
01:32:09,360 --> 01:32:11,280
I mean, Viet like you.

1483
01:32:11,280 --> 01:32:12,560
We're all going to hell for laughing.

1484
01:32:12,560 --> 01:32:15,040
Bye, guys.

1485
01:32:15,040 --> 01:32:18,080
Anything you want to plug?

1486
01:32:18,080 --> 01:32:21,920
www.bmonniestyle.com as always

1487
01:32:21,920 --> 01:32:24,360
the7.net for my web space

1488
01:32:24,360 --> 01:32:27,520
which is almost gone

1489
01:32:27,520 --> 01:32:28,480
killer pals

1490
01:32:28,480 --> 01:32:32,160
I don't know the website because it's too damn long

1491
01:32:32,160 --> 01:32:33,920
maple.org

1492
01:32:33,920 --> 01:32:38,360
because he has the best blog in the world because he doesn't do anything on it

1493
01:32:38,360 --> 01:32:40,440
koreanamerica.com

1494
01:32:40,440 --> 01:32:41,600
soon to come

1495
01:32:41,600 --> 01:32:44,820
because I triple A'd tears

1496
01:32:44,820 --> 01:32:47,700
And B-Lovin' on my second try, which is also my first Nyan footer.

1497
01:32:47,700 --> 01:32:49,300
Did you send those pictures to Aaron?

1498
01:32:49,300 --> 01:32:54,060
Aaron wouldn't take my B-Lovin' because it wasn't the results screen fucking cock.

1499
01:32:54,060 --> 01:32:55,940
The views and opinions expressed on Orange Line.

1500
01:32:55,940 --> 01:33:02,200
He can address those cards and letters to Ver2, care of the Max 300 King's Pals.

1501
01:33:02,200 --> 01:33:04,860
Yeah, my address is...

1502
01:33:04,860 --> 01:33:06,780
Sunnyvale Golf Land.

1503
01:33:06,780 --> 01:33:10,940
1984, El Camino Real, Golf Land, 94068.

1504
01:33:10,940 --> 01:33:14,040
How much time would you say you spend at Sunnyvale Golf Land a week?

1505
01:33:14,040 --> 01:33:28,040
Since Extreme came out, I've been there every day practicing for Saturday Beat Nation because I want the fucking controller, and I need $400 so I can go to Magic 5 up in Seattle, and then go to Midwest Showdown 5 over in Michigan.

1506
01:33:28,040 --> 01:33:29,040
You silly DDR kid.

1507
01:33:29,040 --> 01:33:31,040
Hey, you can suck my cock.

1508
01:33:31,040 --> 01:33:33,040
He is.

1509
01:33:33,040 --> 01:33:36,040
Hey, I got a bigger cock than you.

1510
01:33:36,040 --> 01:33:38,040
And on that note, any final thoughts?

1511
01:33:38,040 --> 01:33:42,040
I'm not going to respond to that because we all know that I have the bigger one.

1512
01:33:42,040 --> 01:33:43,140
Okay, Milton.

1513
01:33:43,140 --> 01:33:44,540
Oh.

1514
01:33:44,540 --> 01:33:46,140
Oh, nevermind, go ahead.

1515
01:33:46,140 --> 01:33:48,040
To be settled on a future episode.

1516
01:33:48,040 --> 01:33:49,440
Uh, any final thoughts for the listeners?

1517
01:33:49,440 --> 01:33:50,740
Write down the chapter where everyone's going.

1518
01:33:50,740 --> 01:33:51,540
Dot, dot, dot.

1519
01:33:51,540 --> 01:33:51,940
Dot, dot, dot.

1520
01:33:51,940 --> 01:33:52,540
Change the subject.

1521
01:33:52,540 --> 01:33:53,040
Dot, dot, dot.

1522
01:33:53,040 --> 01:33:54,540
I can't score the title.

1523
01:33:54,540 --> 01:33:56,040
Oh, my God, the imagery, the imagery.

1524
01:33:56,040 --> 01:33:58,740
Alright, right now I'm pitching fucking twin saying like,

1525
01:33:58,740 --> 01:34:00,940
what the fuck?

1526
01:34:00,940 --> 01:34:03,040
And then, and then there's fucking, um.

1527
01:34:03,040 --> 01:34:04,440
I'm gonna beat, I'm gonna beat that name out

1528
01:34:04,440 --> 01:34:06,740
because we don't, we don't talk about that.

1529
01:34:06,740 --> 01:34:07,740
You're gonna beat twin out?

1530
01:34:07,740 --> 01:34:09,040
Yeah, we're gonna beat that name out.

1531
01:34:09,040 --> 01:34:11,340
What?

1532
01:34:11,340 --> 01:34:13,340
You can't talk about retards on your show?

1533
01:34:13,340 --> 01:34:15,340
Well, okay, I guess we can make it a-

1534
01:34:15,340 --> 01:34:16,340
Just cuz you're Ver2!

1535
01:34:16,340 --> 01:34:18,340
Yes, Jamie?

1536
01:34:18,340 --> 01:34:20,340
By the way, I encourage leaving that intact.

1537
01:34:20,340 --> 01:34:24,340
Yes, so thanks to Jamie, we didn't beep it.

1538
01:34:24,340 --> 01:34:26,340
Jamie convinced me that we shouldn't beep it.

1539
01:34:26,340 --> 01:34:27,340
You're welcome, Corey.

1540
01:34:27,340 --> 01:34:29,340
Here we go. Moving right along.

1541
01:34:29,340 --> 01:34:33,340
I'm gonna be honest with you, your channel is almost as bad as DDR Maniac.

1542
01:34:33,340 --> 01:34:35,340
The channel is-

1543
01:34:35,340 --> 01:34:36,340
Why's that?

1544
01:34:36,340 --> 01:34:38,340
Because it's filled with twin.

1545
01:34:38,340 --> 01:34:40,340
Not anymore, we banned his ass like a month ago.

1546
01:34:40,340 --> 01:34:45,340
That's how long I've been gone because twins there.

1547
01:34:45,340 --> 01:34:47,340
Jesus Christ.

1548
01:34:47,340 --> 01:34:49,340
Hello, welcome to five minutes ago.

1549
01:34:49,340 --> 01:34:50,340
Alright, any final thoughts?

1550
01:34:50,340 --> 01:34:52,340
Um, see you guys at Surrogate Nation?

1551
01:34:52,340 --> 01:34:55,340
I'm expecting another interview at Surrogate Nation.

1552
01:34:55,340 --> 01:34:56,340
We'll see.

1553
01:34:56,340 --> 01:34:57,340
We'll see.

1554
01:34:57,340 --> 01:35:00,340
How much if I bribe you while I give an interview?

1555
01:35:00,340 --> 01:35:02,340
Maybe if I get to play that controller that you win.

1556
01:35:02,340 --> 01:35:05,340
Uh, we're tired of listening to Virtu, we want to hear some Kyle Snyder.

1557
01:35:05,340 --> 01:35:07,340
No! It's all about me!

1558
01:35:07,340 --> 01:35:08,340
I mean, Snyder!

1559
01:35:08,340 --> 01:35:11,340
Why don't we interview this fellow over here?

1560
01:35:11,340 --> 01:35:16,340
Actually, before we interview that fellow over there, Jamie wanted to read something for all you folks.

1561
01:35:16,340 --> 01:35:22,340
This is an email sent by Twin bragging about all the channels he's been banned from.

1562
01:35:22,340 --> 01:35:29,340
Actually, this was an email sent by Twin because I told him to fuck off for trying to start shit last week,

1563
01:35:29,340 --> 01:35:32,340
and the dumbass, he emailed me back and was like,

1564
01:35:32,340 --> 01:35:35,580
Oh, please, please, please, can you send me the arcade diss for DDRX stream?

1565
01:35:35,580 --> 01:35:38,660
Like I'm going to say, oh, okay, I'll just totally forget that.

1566
01:35:38,660 --> 01:35:43,700
But instead he's like, hey, Loki, this is the only other way I know how to get in contact with you.

1567
01:35:43,700 --> 01:35:46,300
He sent me an email through my website because there's a form.

1568
01:35:46,300 --> 01:35:53,260
Since I'm banned from DDR Maniacs, ItMusic, BimaniStyle, DDR UK, and Orange Lounge.

1569
01:35:53,260 --> 01:35:55,860
Congratulations.

1570
01:35:55,860 --> 01:35:58,940
Congratulations, you suck.

1571
01:35:58,940 --> 01:36:01,060
All right, moving right along with the interviews.

1572
01:36:01,060 --> 01:36:02,900

01:36:02,900 --> 01:36:04,540

thank you welcome

1590
01:36:44,380 --> 01:36:48,500
would you like to put myself on the list of it means is that it means with that

1591
01:36:48,500 --> 01:36:49,620

1592
01:36:49,620 --> 01:36:51,980
i have my camera she got ahead of for me

1593
01:36:51,980 --> 01:36:53,820
i had a before her interview

1594
01:36:53,820 --> 01:36:56,500
hi so what's your name

1595
01:36:56,500 --> 01:36:58,500
Alex, what's your...

1596
01:36:58,500 --> 01:37:00,500
Mr. Cool.

1597
01:37:00,500 --> 01:37:02,500
Mr. Cool.

1598
01:37:02,500 --> 01:37:04,500
And what's it supposed to mean?

1599
01:37:04,500 --> 01:37:06,500
Actually, I got it. It's a nickname.

1600
01:37:06,500 --> 01:37:09,500
During class one day, we were talking about rappers.

1601
01:37:09,500 --> 01:37:11,500
I said something about Mr. Cool.

1602
01:37:11,500 --> 01:37:14,500
One of my friends misunderstood me from Mr. Cool.

1603
01:37:14,500 --> 01:37:16,500
So that's pretty much how I got the name.

1604
01:37:16,500 --> 01:37:18,500
And so...

1605
01:37:18,500 --> 01:37:21,500
That's funny that it happened in school, because it's like, be cool, stay in school.

1606
01:37:21,500 --> 01:37:23,500
Yeah.

1607
01:37:23,500 --> 01:37:25,500
Did you stay in school?

1608
01:37:25,500 --> 01:37:28,500
I didn't stay in college, but I'm not a role model, so it's okay.

1609
01:37:28,500 --> 01:37:29,500
You're not cool.

1610
01:37:29,500 --> 01:37:31,500
I know.

1611
01:37:31,500 --> 01:37:33,500
I drink and smoke crack.

1612
01:37:33,500 --> 01:37:35,500
But anyway, I'm sorry, I'm not being interviewed.

1613
01:37:35,500 --> 01:37:37,500
He oozes sex as well.

1614
01:37:37,500 --> 01:37:40,500
So, what are you doing today at the tournament?

1615
01:37:40,500 --> 01:37:41,500
Are you an MPA, freestyle?

1616
01:37:41,500 --> 01:37:42,500
Freestyle.

1617
01:37:42,500 --> 01:37:43,500
Improv freestyle, yeah.

1618
01:37:43,500 --> 01:37:44,500
Freestyle.

1619
01:37:44,500 --> 01:37:45,500
What's the mode if you're going with?

1620
01:37:45,500 --> 01:37:46,500
Mode?

1621
01:37:46,500 --> 01:37:47,500
Mode.

1622
01:37:47,500 --> 01:37:48,500
Any theme?

1623
01:37:48,500 --> 01:37:49,500
No, I'm just...

1624
01:37:49,500 --> 01:37:50,500
No.

1625
01:37:50,500 --> 01:37:53,500
I'm just hoping I have a fast line and just do whatever.

1626
01:37:53,500 --> 01:37:56,500
Do you plan to do hand drops and hand plants and knee drops?

1627
01:37:56,500 --> 01:37:57,500
Stupid!

1628
01:37:57,500 --> 01:37:58,500
No.

1629
01:37:58,500 --> 01:37:59,500
What was that?

1630
01:37:59,500 --> 01:38:00,500
No.

1631
01:38:00,500 --> 01:38:02,500
Are you praying for dynamite rave?

1632
01:38:02,500 --> 01:38:03,500
Definitely.

1633
01:38:03,500 --> 01:38:05,500
As long as I get that song, I'll be good.

1634
01:38:05,500 --> 01:38:06,500
If not, I'll argue.

1635
01:38:06,500 --> 01:38:08,500
Can we see a bar hop in your routine?

1636
01:38:08,500 --> 01:38:09,500
Yeah, no.

1637
01:38:09,500 --> 01:38:10,500
No.

1638
01:38:10,500 --> 01:38:11,500
No, we can't see any bar hops?

1639
01:38:11,500 --> 01:38:13,500
I think I'll get disqualified.

1640
01:38:13,500 --> 01:38:14,500
The bar.

1641
01:38:14,500 --> 01:38:15,500
The bar's your friend.

1642
01:38:15,500 --> 01:38:16,500
I know.

1643
01:38:16,500 --> 01:38:17,500
I know.

1644
01:38:17,500 --> 01:38:18,500
I like the bar.

1645
01:38:18,500 --> 01:38:21,500
But I would rather, uh, jump over the bar.

1646
01:38:21,500 --> 01:38:27,780
the bar. Do you have any final words for the listeners? No. Okay, that's you. I'm better

1647
01:38:27,780 --> 01:38:34,660
than you. Peace out. Hey, all right. The tournament's over now, but I got one more interview tonight

1648
01:38:34,660 --> 01:38:38,560
because I missed him at Fremont. I promised to interview this guy at Fremont and I completely

1649
01:38:38,560 --> 01:38:43,020
forgot because I'm an asshole, but here he is. Introduce yourself for our listening audience.

1650
01:38:43,020 --> 01:38:49,700
I'm Ben, aka Chubbs, and that's all I got to say about that. How you doing? I'm not

1651
01:38:49,700 --> 01:38:55,580
that I guess. What brought you to the Milpitas tournament tonight? Well, I was judging, so

1652
01:38:55,580 --> 01:39:01,740
if I didn't come, I think Milton would be angry with me. Sounds pretty reasonable. So

1653
01:39:01,740 --> 01:39:05,820
what kinds of things were you looking for tonight in the improv routines? Well, my specific

1654
01:39:05,820 --> 01:39:11,980
category as a judge was looking for the charisma, so that was the only thing I was judging on.

1655
01:39:11,980 --> 01:39:15,900
What kind of like good, what were some of the good qualities that you saw tonight, the

1656
01:39:15,900 --> 01:39:19,340
better charismatic things that you saw tonight?

1657
01:39:19,340 --> 01:39:24,060
Well, little B was facing the crowd pretty much the whole time, and that was pretty good

1658
01:39:24,060 --> 01:39:28,460
for Chris, man. He looked like he was having a pretty good time, too. JC also, like those

1659
01:39:28,460 --> 01:39:32,900
two in my book, were pretty close. Those were probably the only good ones.

1660
01:39:32,900 --> 01:39:36,220
What do you think about judging improv versus judging routines?

1661
01:39:36,220 --> 01:39:42,980
Judging routines is probably easier, because there's not just one specific thing you judge,

1662
01:39:42,980 --> 01:39:44,580
it's just judging the whole routine.

1663
01:39:44,580 --> 01:39:49,580
Yeah, but at least when you see a bad one, it's not so painful when it's improv, right?

1664
01:39:49,580 --> 01:39:52,580
Yeah, because they have an excuse.

1665
01:39:52,580 --> 01:39:57,580
Right on. So what other kinds of events are you going to be attending in the near future? Anything you want to plug, or I don't know?

1666
01:39:57,580 --> 01:40:06,580
I don't know. I'm just going to go to pretty much every tournament in the future. We've active basic, CVN, and I don't know what's after that.

1667
01:40:06,580 --> 01:40:08,580
How'd you do in Perfect Attack? Did you do Perfect Attack today?

1668
01:40:08,580 --> 01:40:10,580
Yeah, I got third.

1669
01:40:10,580 --> 01:40:11,580
Not too shabby.

1670
01:40:11,580 --> 01:40:14,800
Kind of see Milton fucked up and

1671
01:40:16,320 --> 01:40:22,340
He forgot to have the third place match between me and chaos. So yeah, we're splitting third

1672
01:40:22,980 --> 01:40:28,020
It's all good works. So any other final thoughts you have for the folks out there listening?

1673
01:40:30,340 --> 01:40:32,060
No

1674
01:40:32,060 --> 01:40:39,260
All right, that works. I think we're all tired as hell and it's time to go home. So that's it. Milpitas Golf Land

1675
01:40:39,260 --> 01:40:41,140
We're out. Bye

1676
01:40:41,140 --> 01:40:44,140
Alright, we're back. That was it, the Milpitas Interviews.

1677
01:40:44,140 --> 01:40:48,140
So, we're going to take a quick break and we're going to come back and we're going to do a list list segment.

1678
01:40:48,140 --> 01:40:54,140
Actually, I want to play this sound file. SoCal Kicks sent this to me, and we haven't heard this yet.

1679
01:40:54,140 --> 01:40:59,580
heard this yet. It's called Sky in the Year 1986, which is kind of a scary sound title

1680
01:40:59,580 --> 01:41:02,580
name. I haven't even heard this yet, so let's try this.

1681
01:41:02,580 --> 01:41:16,580
Don't forget, Love Fist are in town right now. What is it? Love Fist is in town. Whatever.

1682
01:41:16,580 --> 01:41:22,580
I flunk school because I'm hardcore. What? I've never even said that shit in my life.

1683
01:41:22,580 --> 01:41:24,500
What is this?

1684
01:41:24,500 --> 01:41:25,660
It's from Vice City.

1685
01:41:25,660 --> 01:41:28,500
And that guy supposedly sounds like me or something?

1686
01:41:28,500 --> 01:41:32,780
Somebody was telling me the other day that I sound like some guy in Vice City.

1687
01:41:32,780 --> 01:41:33,780
Rob's famous.

1688
01:41:33,780 --> 01:41:34,420
That's scary.

1689
01:41:34,420 --> 01:41:35,140
I'm famous.

1690
01:41:35,140 --> 01:41:35,740
Infamous.

1691
01:41:35,740 --> 01:41:38,060
That is me, damn it.

1692
01:41:38,060 --> 01:41:38,540
Yeah, right.

1693
01:41:38,540 --> 01:41:39,020
Anyway.

1694
01:41:39,020 --> 01:41:39,500
OK, yes.

1695
01:41:39,500 --> 01:41:40,060
We're going to take a break.

1696
01:41:40,060 --> 01:41:41,420
When we come back, we're going to do a list list.

1697
01:41:41,420 --> 01:41:43,700
And that means you all get to participate.

1698
01:41:43,700 --> 01:41:45,100
And you're going to vote.

1699
01:41:45,100 --> 01:41:47,020
So here's a hint, you guys.

1700
01:41:47,020 --> 01:41:49,020
During the break, you're going to get a big hint

1701
01:41:49,020 --> 01:41:51,260
as to what our list list topic is tonight.

1702
01:41:51,260 --> 01:41:52,260
Enjoy.

1703
01:41:52,260 --> 01:41:56,420
I'm supposed to say hi to Strong Brad and apologizing for not interviewing him at MIGL.

1704
01:41:56,420 --> 01:41:58,020
We'll get him next time.

1705
01:41:58,020 --> 01:42:02,420
The next interviews, by the way, will be at Cyberbeat Nation in a couple weeks.

1706
01:42:02,420 --> 01:42:08,100
There might even be a whole separate special out of that, like a different error tape thing.

1707
01:42:08,100 --> 01:42:09,100
I'm not sure yet.

1708
01:42:09,100 --> 01:42:10,940
We have to talk about that, all the hosts.

1709
01:42:10,940 --> 01:42:13,740
Anyway, I do not sound like Cookie from You Don't Know Jack.

1710
01:42:13,740 --> 01:42:14,740
Fuck off.

1711
01:42:14,740 --> 01:42:15,740
Shut up!

1712
01:42:15,740 --> 01:42:16,740
All of you!

1713
01:42:16,740 --> 01:42:17,740
Shut up!

1714
01:42:17,740 --> 01:42:18,740
All right, we'll be back.

1715
01:42:18,740 --> 01:42:26,740
I'll do it all night, do it with me, I'll take you to heaven if you make me feel free, babe

1716
01:42:26,740 --> 01:42:32,740
Do it tonight, do it alright, just take me and shake me till I burn up in time

1717
01:42:32,740 --> 01:42:34,740
I know

1718
01:42:47,940 --> 01:42:51,220
You may have good sex with salmon, fred, and drizzle max

1719
01:42:51,220 --> 01:42:54,580
You may be the slave of Tim and Tom and Ed today

1720
01:42:54,580 --> 01:42:57,940
You may do it again with hands and friends and check and care

1721
01:42:57,940 --> 01:43:01,220
But you're gonna feel so free when you're doing it with me

1722
01:43:01,220 --> 01:43:05,220
Do it all night, do it with me

1723
01:43:05,220 --> 01:43:08,220
I'll take you to heaven if you make me feel free, baby

1724
01:43:08,220 --> 01:43:11,220
Do it tonight, do it all right

1725
01:43:11,220 --> 01:43:14,220
Just take me and shake me till I burn up inside

1726
01:43:14,220 --> 01:43:18,220
Oh, do it all night, do it with me

1727
01:43:18,220 --> 01:43:21,220
As hot as a fire and as strong as a dream

1728
01:43:21,220 --> 01:43:25,220
Do it tonight, do it all right

1729
01:43:25,220 --> 01:43:28,220
You got it, I knew it, you can do it tonight

1730
01:43:28,220 --> 01:43:43,220
This time is a fire, this is a troll, this is a dream

1731
01:43:43,220 --> 01:43:45,220
Come on, do it with me

1732
01:43:45,220 --> 01:43:51,220
Kiss me, light me up high, wanna feel like a frisbee

1733
01:43:51,220 --> 01:43:54,220
High in the sky, oh I want you to kiss me

01:43:54,220 --> 01:43:57,220
Do it alright, cause I know that you miss me

1735

Whoa, whoa, whoa

01:44:10,220 --> 01:44:13,220
Watching love you in so many lonely nights

1737
01:44:14,220 --> 01:44:16,220
With my body and soul and I know you around

1738
01:44:17,220 --> 01:44:19,220
There in the city lights

1739
01:44:20,220 --> 01:44:21,220
Just out of control

1740
01:44:21,220 --> 01:44:23,220
I walk around and all my friends walk through my floor

1741
01:44:23,220 --> 01:44:25,220
Just lose their ground, I'm near to you but I walk behind

1742
01:44:25,220 --> 01:44:28,220
Like the sound in the sky, all the time they watch your face

1743
01:44:28,220 --> 01:44:30,220
You own the distance and the race, love me

1744
01:44:30,220 --> 01:44:33,220
In the heat of the night, babe I feel like dynamite

1745
01:44:33,220 --> 01:44:35,220
Oh baby just kiss me, body up high

1746

Hello kids, welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio.

1757
01:45:38,940 --> 01:45:42,300
I missed an FU that came in over email.

1758
01:45:42,300 --> 01:45:45,900
What happened is I'd actually read it before the show and then forgot to get back to it

1759
01:45:45,900 --> 01:45:50,460
when the show was going on so fuck me for missing it I'm sorry sorry and it's

1760
01:45:50,460 --> 01:45:53,780
from DDR Angel who's a huge supporter of this show and I feel bad because I

1761
01:45:53,780 --> 01:46:00,420
missed it so let's get to her f you her f you is fuck you to my graveyard shift

1762
01:46:00,420 --> 01:46:03,860
co-worker who didn't bother to call me once last night to tell me he was gonna

So my bad, I missed that earlier in the show, please accept my apology!

1767
01:46:23,760 --> 01:46:27,080
And does anybody know the final results from MGL?

1768
01:46:27,080 --> 01:46:28,560
Good question.

1769
01:46:28,560 --> 01:46:35,280
First place in Perfect Attack was Tigger, second was Virtu, and third was Chubbs and

1770
01:46:35,280 --> 01:46:38,680
Chaos I believe tied, I hope I didn't fuck that up.

1771
01:46:38,680 --> 01:46:47,240
freestyle, improv freestyle. First was JC, I believe his name was. Second place was,

1772
01:46:47,240 --> 01:46:52,280
oh, I can look it up on DER for you, that's a good idea. I know second place was Lil B.

1773
01:46:52,280 --> 01:46:58,840
Third place was somebody else. I don't remember who third place was. Let me look. I know Oakey

1774
01:46:58,840 --> 01:47:02,520
was in fourth. Oh, I think, yes, yes, because Fuzzy Cat won money. He was excited he won

1775
01:47:02,520 --> 01:47:04,520
Fuzzy Hat was third, you're right. Thank you.

1776
01:47:05,520 --> 01:47:06,520
Alright.

1777
01:47:08,520 --> 01:47:10,520
Alright, thank you. You guys, uh...

1778
01:47:11,520 --> 01:47:15,520
Hey, and even... One of the judges is in the chat room. I'm so retarded I didn't even think to ask.

1779
01:47:15,520 --> 01:47:17,520
But she's... Jenny Bean does confirm that yes.

1780
01:47:17,520 --> 01:47:18,520
Hello, by the way, Jenny.

1781
01:47:18,520 --> 01:47:21,520
Uh, JC, Lil B, and Fuzzy. One, two, and three right there.

1782
01:47:21,520 --> 01:47:22,520
Alright.

1783
01:47:22,520 --> 01:47:24,520
Alright, now we get to our favorite part of the show.

1784
01:47:24,520 --> 01:47:26,520
Uh, Angel also says fuck you to her handful.

1785
01:47:26,520 --> 01:47:29,520
Well, my second favorite part of the show... Actually, my favorite part of the show is the fuck you to the week, but...

1786
01:47:29,520 --> 01:47:30,520
Our other favorite part of the show.

1787
01:47:30,520 --> 01:47:31,520
Yay!

1788
01:47:31,520 --> 01:47:35,800
yay it's the list list and tonight the topic is the list list

1789
01:47:35,800 --> 01:47:39,480
are you sure you should do a theme song? No. Sing us a theme song.

1790
01:47:39,480 --> 01:47:41,680
It's a list list, yay.

1791
01:47:41,680 --> 01:47:46,920
You're on a roll there. We'll get...

1792
01:47:46,920 --> 01:47:51,680
Everybody. That's what the fucking song is.

1793
01:47:51,680 --> 01:47:52,680
You know what?

1794
01:47:52,680 --> 01:47:58,000
You know what? We're gonna get...

1795
01:47:58,000 --> 01:48:00,000
No, this is not Dancer. I'm blowing up people's speakers.

1796
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:01,000
Sunday, Sunday, Sunday, it's the list list.

1797
01:48:01,000 --> 01:48:02,000
Um, okay.

1798
01:48:03,000 --> 01:48:05,000
Oh, where were we? Yes, list list, nice list list.

1799
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:10,000
Title, er, um, song that Erotic needs to do.

1800
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:12,000
A possible title for a new Erotic song.

1801
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:16,000
This is actually coming from my, uh, my fuck off show from Tuesday, was it?

1802
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:19,000
Where we were, like, coming up with Erotic song titles in the chat room.

1803
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:24,000
Which I'm actually doing a, a, a, one of them on my list.

1804
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:29,000
Alright, so these are all songs that Erotic hasn't done, but they should.

1805
01:48:29,000 --> 01:48:33,000
So, starting off, we've got, who's all participating in the room?

1806
01:48:33,000 --> 01:48:35,000
Raise your hands so I make sure I don't miss everyone.

1807
01:48:35,000 --> 01:48:36,000
One, two, three, four, five, six.

1808
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:38,000
Okay, we've got six people participating, so we've got quite a few.

1809
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:41,000
Ryan is participating, but...

1810
01:48:41,000 --> 01:48:43,000
Ryan is reading for Ryan.

1811
01:48:43,000 --> 01:48:45,000
I'm reading for someone else, so these aren't mine.

1812
01:48:45,000 --> 01:48:45,000
Alright.

1813
01:48:45,000 --> 01:48:46,000
I'm reading for Ryan.

1814
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:47,000
And then we have the other Ryan.

1815
01:48:47,000 --> 01:48:48,000
We have Puppy Ryan.

1816
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:48,000
Puppy!

1817
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:50,000
You're not, you aren't Ryan, you're Puppy.

1818
01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:51,000
Alright.

1819
01:48:51,000 --> 01:48:52,000
Who's starting?

1820
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:53,000

1821
01:48:53,000 --> 01:49:00,280
Alright, Jamie, your number three pick for an erotic song.

1824
01:49:08,480 --> 01:49:10,240

1829
01:49:20,200 --> 01:49:21,480
These aren't his picks, but they're the other Ryan's.

1830
01:49:21,480 --> 01:49:23,480
You were singing that to the tune of Love on the Phone.

1831
01:49:23,480 --> 01:49:25,480
You're right, I was.

1832
01:49:25,480 --> 01:49:27,480
Alright, I have no idea which order this is in, so I'll just do the first one.

1833
01:49:27,480 --> 01:49:29,480
Alright, we'll just pick one. It's number three.

01:49:43,480 --> 01:49:46,480

01:51:40,660 --> 01:51:43,660
Wouldn't that be featuring Polteri?

1875
01:51:43,660 --> 01:51:47,660
But, well, Erotic hasn't done anything with Naoki that we know of.

01:53:35,340 --> 01:53:38,340
I'm going to have to read this one for Ryan because he's not here.

1904
01:53:38,340 --> 01:53:39,340
Too shy, huh?

1905
01:53:39,340 --> 01:53:45,340
Just hurry up and shoot it in my eyes so I can get paid for doing this damn porno flick and go home.

I'm shortening that to just hurry up and shoot it in my eyes because that's too long.

1908
01:54:00,340 --> 01:54:03,340
We got a lot of great suggestions from the chat room.

1913
01:54:22,340 --> 01:54:26,340
Would that be like the We Are the Lollipop Kids song? Oh, yes.

1914
01:54:26,340 --> 01:54:29,340
Coming to the temple of butt.

1915
01:54:29,340 --> 01:54:31,340
Alright.

1916
01:54:31,340 --> 01:54:34,340

01:58:01,080 --> 01:58:05,440

1978
01:58:15,280 --> 01:58:21,280
Well, first of all, I don't think anybody wants to think of Naoki sucking cock, okay?

1979
01:58:21,280 --> 01:58:27,280
Remember, Naoki's flexible enough to suck his own cock.

1980
01:58:27,280 --> 01:58:32,280
I didn't want that image, okay? Anyway...

And now step forward to Lambda, set up the rating on the 12 mode through program 1.

2043
02:06:03,680 --> 02:06:18,620
And now it's time for Erotic Pop Idol, where we will find the next singer for everyone's

2044
02:06:18,620 --> 02:06:21,180
favorite perverse baumannii band, Erotic.

2045
02:06:21,180 --> 02:06:22,820
Do it all night.

2046
02:06:22,820 --> 02:06:24,300
Do it with me.

2047
02:06:24,300 --> 02:06:26,940
No, no, that was awful, bloody terrible.

2048
02:06:26,940 --> 02:06:28,300
Do you take vocal lessons?

2049
02:06:28,300 --> 02:06:29,300
Kill your teacher.

2050
02:06:29,300 --> 02:06:31,140
In the heat of the night.

2051
02:06:31,140 --> 02:06:33,660
Oh God, I think my ears are bleeding.

2052
02:06:33,660 --> 02:06:35,660
I liked it!

2053
02:06:35,660 --> 02:06:38,660
Shut the bloody hell up, Paula! Next!

2054
02:06:38,660 --> 02:06:43,660
Oh, that was cool.

2055
02:06:43,660 --> 02:06:48,660
Do you even know why you're here? That was just bloody pathetic! Next!

2056
02:06:48,660 --> 02:06:52,660
Come on, man. Come on, do it with me.

2057
02:06:52,660 --> 02:06:56,660
Yes! Yes, that's it! We have a winner!

2058
02:06:56,660 --> 02:07:01,660
A star is born here on Orange Lounge Radio.

2059
02:07:01,660 --> 02:07:08,020
Alright, we have the results for what has been one of our most popular, I think it's

2060
02:07:08,020 --> 02:07:11,500
one of our most popular listless segments we've ever done here on this show.

2061
02:07:11,500 --> 02:07:12,500
It was fun.

2062
02:07:12,500 --> 02:07:13,500
It was fun, that's for sure.

2063
02:07:13,500 --> 02:07:15,740
You remember that adult content disclaimer at the beginning of the show?

2064
02:07:15,740 --> 02:07:16,740
I hope you all were listening.

2065
02:07:16,740 --> 02:07:17,740
Yeah, pay attention.

2066
02:07:17,740 --> 02:07:21,860
And when I posted about this on the DDR Community Live Journal, I put, you know, warning, there's

2067
02:07:21,860 --> 02:07:25,500
some adult content on this program if you all are like 12 years old.

2068
02:07:25,500 --> 02:07:26,500
Some.

2069
02:07:26,500 --> 02:07:27,500
Some.

2070
02:07:27,500 --> 02:07:29,460
Everybody at once in here, some!

2071
02:07:29,460 --> 02:07:31,020
Don't you ever talk about DDR on that show?

2072
02:07:31,020 --> 02:07:34,020
All you ever talk about is porn. Oh, yes, the list. Here we go.

2073
02:07:34,020 --> 02:07:37,020
Uh, I'm gonna give Jamie the distinct pleasure of getting to read these,

2074
02:07:37,020 --> 02:07:41,020
because we all love, uh, when a, you know, woman's saying these dirty things to us.

2075
02:07:41,020 --> 02:07:42,020
Number three.

2076
02:07:42,020 --> 02:07:43,020
All right, the number three winner is...

2077
02:07:43,020 --> 02:07:44,020
I like it in the ass. No.

2078
02:07:44,020 --> 02:07:46,020
No, that wasn't one of the choices.

2079
02:07:46,020 --> 02:07:48,020
Last week on Orange Lounge Radio.

2080
02:07:48,020 --> 02:07:50,020
Shut up. We don't even do this anymore.

2081
02:07:50,020 --> 02:07:51,020
All right.

2082
02:07:51,020 --> 02:07:53,020
Number three is Temple of Butt.

2083
02:07:53,020 --> 02:07:56,020
Yay! Temple of Butt. All right.

2084
02:07:56,020 --> 02:07:59,020
Number two. Hundred Midget Game Bang.

2085
02:07:59,020 --> 02:08:01,020
hundred-digit gang bang, yay!

2086
02:08:01,020 --> 02:08:03,020
And number one!

2087
02:08:03,020 --> 02:08:05,020
Sam Lick My Clam.

2088
02:08:05,020 --> 02:08:07,020
Sam Lick My Clam!

2089
02:08:07,020 --> 02:08:09,020
Wow, that was a last-minute entry, too.

2090
02:08:09,020 --> 02:08:11,020
And you know what?

2091
02:08:11,020 --> 02:08:13,020
It's all three of us.

2092
02:08:13,020 --> 02:08:15,020
It's the host circle.

2093
02:08:15,020 --> 02:08:17,020
With of course me being number one,

2094
02:08:17,020 --> 02:08:19,020
because I'm the best.

2095
02:08:19,020 --> 02:08:21,020
And you all love me and worship me like the goddess I am.

2096
02:08:21,020 --> 02:08:23,020
So Sam Lick My Clam is where I am.

2097
02:08:23,020 --> 02:08:25,020
I still like Temple of But.

2098
02:08:25,020 --> 02:08:27,020
See, Brad's bowing down to me.

2099
02:08:27,020 --> 02:08:29,460
like watching my ex have hot man sex.

2100
02:08:29,460 --> 02:08:30,460
That was a good one.

2101
02:08:30,460 --> 02:08:31,460
That was very close.

2102
02:08:31,460 --> 02:08:32,460
It was very close.

2103
02:08:32,460 --> 02:08:33,460
That was almost in there.

2104
02:08:33,460 --> 02:08:37,980
Um, Brad, can you sing us Temple of Butt one more time?

2105
02:08:37,980 --> 02:08:38,980
What?

2106
02:08:38,980 --> 02:08:40,980
Sing Temple of Butt.

2107
02:08:40,980 --> 02:08:41,980
Okay.

2108
02:08:41,980 --> 02:08:43,540
Temple of Butt.

2109
02:08:43,540 --> 02:08:45,540
Come and do the Temple of Butt.

2110
02:08:45,540 --> 02:08:46,540
Alright.

2111
02:08:46,540 --> 02:08:47,540
Anyway.

2112
02:08:47,540 --> 02:08:50,020
I was thinking it's the Winnie the Pooh theme.

2113
02:08:50,020 --> 02:08:51,700
We still have a cage match.

2114
02:08:51,700 --> 02:08:53,100
We still have a cage match to do.

2115
02:08:53,100 --> 02:08:54,100
Temple of Butt.

2116
02:08:54,100 --> 02:08:55,100
Oh, okay.

2117
02:08:55,100 --> 02:08:56,100
We want to do this.

2118
02:08:56,100 --> 02:09:03,100
what you talk about this

2119
02:09:04,300 --> 02:09:08,500
guys are weird suddenly i'm in preschool again we're all everybody sitting here

2120
02:09:08,500 --> 02:09:08,980
going

2121
02:09:08,980 --> 02:09:15,980
will be looking at what i got hot hot hot hot back out again

2122
02:09:23,900 --> 02:09:25,980
i still i still think this

2123
02:09:25,980 --> 02:09:49,940
The end is fucked up because it's not finished yet and I have to hurry to get it done, so

2124
02:09:49,940 --> 02:09:53,460
you'll notice that the rest of the song sounds cool in the end, you're like, huh?

2125
02:09:53,460 --> 02:09:57,900
So this is a sort of trance remix of Legend of Max.

2126
02:09:57,900 --> 02:09:58,780
Now why did you do this?

2127
02:09:58,780 --> 02:10:01,220
Just for the hell of it, or did you do it for that little contest that's going on

2128
02:10:01,220 --> 02:10:02,420
about my style, or what's this about?

2129
02:10:02,420 --> 02:10:03,500
I didn't know.

2130
02:10:03,500 --> 02:10:06,260
I did it because I found the song that they got the vocals out of for

2131
02:10:06,260 --> 02:10:08,780
Legend of Max, and that's the whole reason why.

2132
02:10:08,780 --> 02:10:11,020
And I was like, woo, vocals!

2133
02:10:11,020 --> 02:10:12,980
So are you going to enter this?

2134
02:10:12,980 --> 02:10:14,900
You should enter this in the 2DX remixing contest.

2135
02:10:14,900 --> 02:10:19,460
I know Legend of Max isn't a 2DX song yet, but you could call it a Max 300 mix,

2136
02:10:19,460 --> 02:10:21,460
For one, they canceled that contest.

2137
02:10:21,460 --> 02:10:23,460
What? Why?

2138
02:10:23,460 --> 02:10:24,460
I don't know.

2139
02:10:24,460 --> 02:10:25,460
Fuck that!

2140
02:10:25,460 --> 02:10:26,460
So that's gone.

2141
02:10:26,460 --> 02:10:30,460
And two, well I guess I could do, I have to finish it first.

2142
02:10:30,460 --> 02:10:34,460
I have to, you know, get rid of some of the parts that don't sound quite right.

2143
02:10:34,460 --> 02:10:38,460
But this is, until I come up with a better name, The Legend of Trance.

2144
02:10:38,460 --> 02:10:40,460
Alright, so this is The Legend of Trance by Loki.

2145
02:10:40,460 --> 02:10:42,460
Wait, would you make me a trance mix of something?

2146
02:10:42,460 --> 02:10:44,460
Make me a trance mix too!

2147
02:10:44,460 --> 02:10:46,460
Come on, I want a trance mix.

2148
02:10:46,460 --> 02:10:48,460
I want a reality.

2149
02:10:48,460 --> 02:10:56,740
We want to hear what you guys think about this in the chat room, so post your thoughts.

2150
02:10:56,740 --> 02:11:00,100
You all can be a judge on American Idol right now and judge Loki.

2151
02:11:00,100 --> 02:11:01,100
Won't this be fabulous?

2152
02:11:01,100 --> 02:11:03,500
Okay, this is Legend of Trance here on Orange Mountain Radio.

2153
02:12:01,100 --> 02:12:03,100
Oh

2154
02:13:01,100 --> 02:13:10,900
10. 40. I'm wet right now. Yeah, I'm gonna give you 100. Change your pants. Already off

2155
02:13:10,900 --> 02:13:17,580
the scale, but I'll give it a 9. Since it's my song, the end still needs work, especially

2156
02:13:17,580 --> 02:13:21,940
that one, the second, like, slow down there where it says the death and then the fly need

2157
02:13:21,940 --> 02:13:27,900
to really work on that from there on. That needs work, but yeah, I like it. It's pretty

2158
02:13:27,900 --> 02:13:31,900
Well, let's just say it's off the scale. This one kicks hella ass.

2159
02:13:31,900 --> 02:13:35,900
I can't really give it a number. This is over 10 or whatever.

2160
02:13:35,900 --> 02:13:39,900
Just to say, do be continued on the numbers scale.

2161
02:13:39,900 --> 02:13:43,900
AAA, then.

2162
02:13:43,900 --> 02:13:47,900
You know, to be honest, it didn't sound a lot

2163
02:13:47,900 --> 02:13:51,900
remixed, but, like, enough so that, like, you know, the Paranoias aren't really

2164
02:13:51,900 --> 02:13:55,900
remixed that much either, so I think that fits into

2165
02:13:55,900 --> 02:14:00,900
compared to most of the damn maxes I hear online

2166
02:14:00,900 --> 02:14:02,900
actually to be honest I thought it was like

2167
02:14:02,900 --> 02:14:04,900
hardly any max in there

2168
02:14:04,900 --> 02:14:06,900
I don't know I just kind of heard the melody

2169
02:14:06,900 --> 02:14:09,900
most of the stuff is off of tranceaddict.com

2170
02:14:09,900 --> 02:14:11,900
I believe the song I used was called I'm Alone

2171
02:14:11,900 --> 02:14:13,900
or something like that

2172
02:14:13,900 --> 02:14:14,900
that was for most of it

2173
02:14:14,900 --> 02:14:16,900
then there's another song by The Deep Project

2174
02:14:16,900 --> 02:14:18,900
that's called The Fly

2175
02:14:18,900 --> 02:14:20,900
which is where they got most of the

2176
02:14:20,900 --> 02:14:21,900
Really?

2177
02:14:21,900 --> 02:14:22,900
I've got the MP3 on there

2178
02:14:22,900 --> 02:14:23,900
it's like 9 minutes long

2179
02:14:23,900 --> 02:14:50,900
Hey, I'll buy you dinner if you make me like an ambient trance remix of the safari.

2180
02:14:53,900 --> 02:14:57,900
We'll see. Okay, shit.

2181
02:14:57,900 --> 02:15:05,900
Alright, speaking of the cage match, I think we ought to get to this week's version of it, shouldn't we?

2182
02:15:05,900 --> 02:15:11,900
Alright, so, let's get into that.

2183
02:15:11,900 --> 02:15:22,900
So, I'm finding the cage match theme music here that somebody requested earlier in the show we specifically not play.

2184
02:15:22,900 --> 02:15:25,900
What are you taking that out for? We need that, don't we?

2185
02:15:25,900 --> 02:15:28,900
Oh, mine's on there, but yours is on here.

2186
02:15:28,900 --> 02:15:29,900
Oh, what? Eh?

2187
02:15:29,900 --> 02:15:31,900
We'll do yours first, Logie.

2188
02:15:31,900 --> 02:15:33,900
That's fine. Okay, bring yours in.

2189
02:15:33,900 --> 02:15:35,900
Okay, never mind. We know what we're doing.

2190
02:15:35,900 --> 02:15:37,900
Anyway, yes, last week.

2191
02:15:37,900 --> 02:15:39,900
Last week on the Orange Lounge Cage Match.

2192
02:15:39,900 --> 02:15:42,900
Free prize from last week, K.K. Cockmaster.

2193
02:15:42,900 --> 02:15:43,900
Wait, wrong week.

2194
02:15:43,900 --> 02:15:45,900
Uh, we had, the winner was, uh,

2195
02:15:45,900 --> 02:15:48,900
Jamie brought in a Vincent D'Amour song,

2196
02:15:48,900 --> 02:15:51,900
and it pretty much swept the floor.

2197
02:15:51,900 --> 02:15:55,900
And it won, so we'll play a little clip of that.

2198
02:15:55,900 --> 02:15:58,900
The way the cage match works, by the way, since I know we have a lot of new listeners tonight.

2199
02:15:58,900 --> 02:16:03,900
Each host brings in one song, and we pit them all against each other.

2200
02:16:03,900 --> 02:16:07,900
And so we have the winning song from last week, and then two new ones that go head-to-head.

2201
02:16:07,900 --> 02:16:12,900
The winning song goes into rotation on the Orange Ons Radio's Bomani Music & More program.

2202
02:16:12,900 --> 02:16:14,900
Always on the station when we're not here.

2203
02:16:14,900 --> 02:16:15,900
Live?

2204
02:16:15,900 --> 02:16:16,900
Yes.

2205
02:16:16,900 --> 02:16:17,900
Head-to-head.

2206
02:16:17,900 --> 02:16:19,900
Head-to-head, yes, that's what I said.

2207
02:16:19,900 --> 02:16:20,900
I said head-to-head.

2208
02:16:20,900 --> 02:16:25,560
Anyway last week. This is the winner so this is the first song you can vote for in this week's cage max

2209
02:16:25,760 --> 02:16:29,440
This is we're just gonna play a clip because the winner only gets a clip played of it

2210
02:16:29,440 --> 02:16:33,920
This is Vincent Amor with eternity from last week here on orange lounge radio

2211
02:16:59,440 --> 02:17:01,440
It takes you all the way

2212
02:17:04,440 --> 02:17:06,440
It's gonna be forever

2213
02:17:11,440 --> 02:17:13,440
Forever

2214
02:17:18,440 --> 02:17:20,440
Forever

2215
02:17:20,440 --> 02:17:42,000
All right, that was last week's winner. That was Vincent Amor with Eternity, last week's

2216
02:17:42,000 --> 02:17:43,000
winner.

2217
02:17:43,000 --> 02:17:44,000
I just had a happy moment with that song.

2218
02:17:44,000 --> 02:17:47,640
It's already, the chat room's kind of slamming on Eternity. They don't know if they care

2219
02:17:47,640 --> 02:17:51,880
for it anymore i think they're they're done with it so let's bring on the challengers

2220
02:17:51,880 --> 02:17:58,280
i don't know jamie looks concerned she's giving the chat room the finger all right let's see i

2221
02:17:58,280 --> 02:18:03,640
would have to say this song falls on a completely opposite scale of that song um this is going to

2222
02:18:03,640 --> 02:18:09,400
be um once again the secretions uh local uh sacramento punk band and with their song i'm

2224
02:18:13,720 --> 02:18:17,000

You'll just sit and hold me, you won't be

2228
02:18:51,000 --> 02:18:52,000
You write a fucked up song

2229
02:18:52,000 --> 02:18:54,000
Put your arm into her hands

2230
02:18:54,000 --> 02:18:56,000
Watch her act with it

2231
02:18:56,000 --> 02:18:58,000
Now let me take you out and get you laid

2232
02:18:59,000 --> 02:19:00,000
I could get you so bad

2233
02:19:00,000 --> 02:19:02,000
I could get you so bad

2234
02:19:02,000 --> 02:19:04,000
I could get you so bad

2235
02:19:04,000 --> 02:19:06,000
I could get you so bad

2236
02:19:08,000 --> 02:19:10,000
Said she loves you, said she knows you

2237
02:19:10,000 --> 02:19:11,000
Said that she'd be true

2238
02:19:11,000 --> 02:19:13,000
At last I'm not alone with someone

2239
02:19:13,000 --> 02:19:15,000
I don't look like you

2240
02:19:15,000 --> 02:19:16,000
Put your arm into her hands

2241
02:19:16,000 --> 02:19:23,000
Now I'm gonna take you out and get you paid Oh yeah, now I'm gonna take you out and get

2242
02:19:23,000 --> 02:19:30,000

Oh yeah, I'm gonna get you, I'm gonna get you laid

02:19:35,000 --> 02:19:37,000
Take it to the money shot boys

02:19:37,000 --> 02:19:42,000
Well now, I'm gonna take you high off

2246
02:19:42,000 --> 02:19:47,000
I'm gonna get you laid, paid, paid, paid, paid, paid, paid, paid

2247
02:19:47,000 --> 02:19:49,000
Well thank you very much for coming tonight!

2248
02:20:17,000 --> 02:20:21,000
The chat room doesn't listen to punk, so they won't appreciate it as much as I do.

2249
02:20:21,000 --> 02:20:24,000
Well, gee, aren't we elitists when it comes to music?

2250
02:20:24,000 --> 02:20:25,000
Exactly.

2251
02:20:25,000 --> 02:20:27,000
Alright, and Jonas, your pick.

2252
02:20:27,000 --> 02:20:28,000
7.5.

2253
02:20:28,000 --> 02:20:29,000
7.5.

2254
02:20:29,000 --> 02:20:30,000
Uh, I'm gonna give it a 5.

2255
02:20:30,000 --> 02:20:31,000
I've heard better punk.

2256
02:20:31,000 --> 02:20:37,000
It was alright, but Little Bitch is better for DDR, but Pain is better than that.

2257
02:20:37,000 --> 02:20:39,000
But, it was alright.

2258
02:20:39,000 --> 02:20:44,000
It's like, if I was at a concert, I'd wanna, like, punch somebody to that song, so that's cool.

2259
02:20:44,000 --> 02:20:48,000
It's not for Orange Lounge, though. It ain't for Orange Lounge, I don't think.

2260
02:20:48,000 --> 02:20:51,000
We'll see. We'll see.

2261
02:20:51,000 --> 02:20:54,000
Alright, so that's your other pick.

2262
02:20:54,000 --> 02:20:57,000
Rob, Rob, I can't do that, so I have to listen to Pat.

2263
02:20:57,000 --> 02:20:58,000
Alright.

2264
02:20:58,000 --> 02:21:01,000
We have Vincent Noire with Eternity, the Supreeces, but I'm going to get you so late.

2265
02:21:01,000 --> 02:21:03,000
And here's the third pick.

2266
02:21:03,000 --> 02:21:06,000
And I don't have an artist for this one. I'm trying to get that this week.

2267
02:21:06,000 --> 02:21:13,000
But this was actually given to me by our buddy Tal, who was here earlier in the show.

2268
02:21:13,000 --> 02:21:17,960
he had this posted on his website this is a song called the terrible mr.

2269
02:21:17,960 --> 02:21:22,680
Grimshaw and what this is this they recorded some guy playing counter-strike

2270
02:21:22,680 --> 02:21:27,480
or half-life or one of those life-killing games and they taped this

2271
02:21:27,480 --> 02:21:32,140
guy playing it and swearing and then they did a techno remix of it and it

2272
02:21:32,140 --> 02:21:35,880
kicks ass so you guys have to hear this this is my pick for the cage match this

2273
02:21:35,880 --> 02:21:39,880
This is the terrible Mr. Grimshaw, here on Orange Lounge Radio.

2274
02:21:39,880 --> 02:21:53,020
uhh

2275
02:21:53,020 --> 02:21:55,020

Oh come on!

02:23:52,540 --> 02:23:54,540
Don't shoot at me!

2331
02:23:54,540 --> 02:23:56,540
I hate that!

2332
02:23:56,540 --> 02:24:03,540
Did I get anyone? Did I have a fucking killin'? Did I get anyone? Did I have a fucking killin'?

2333
02:24:03,540 --> 02:24:07,540
Dude, why the fuck? How did I get fucking shot?

2334
02:24:07,540 --> 02:24:13,540
Just quit shooting me, the fuck you fucking assholes, dude. What the fuck happened?

2335
02:24:13,540 --> 02:24:19,540
Bullshit. I fucking shot you like 50 fucking times. Fuck!

2336
02:24:19,540 --> 02:24:36,780
oh god, oh my head, shit, fuck, ah, fuck, ah, shit, ah, fuck, god damn it, shit, fuck,

2337
02:24:36,780 --> 02:25:04,980
I'm not fucking playing with that idiot right now.

2338
02:25:04,980 --> 02:25:08,900
all right that was uh i'm being told the name of the group

2339
02:25:08,900 --> 02:25:14,180
oh that's too loud hi i'm back the uh the name of the group is the murder

2340
02:25:14,180 --> 02:25:19,860
simulators and that was the terrible mr grimshaw jamie already

2341
02:25:19,860 --> 02:25:23,780
expressed her disgust for this song but let's hear it

2342
02:25:23,780 --> 02:25:28,980
if it had a good background music i would give it a higher score

2343
02:25:28,980 --> 02:25:33,980
I would give it a higher score, but I hear that all the time just hanging out with Dan.

2344
02:25:33,980 --> 02:25:37,980
I'm hearing him talk shit on MECASOLD on Xbox Live.

2345
02:25:37,980 --> 02:25:40,980
So I give that a 2.

2346
02:25:40,980 --> 02:25:44,980
Because at least part of it we're in key.

2347
02:25:44,980 --> 02:25:46,980
Zero.

2348
02:25:46,980 --> 02:25:50,980
I don't know, I've played quite a bit of Half-Life with Counter-Strike

2349
02:25:50,980 --> 02:25:52,980
if I can understand the guy's frustration.

2350
02:25:52,980 --> 02:25:57,980
So I'd say I give that a 6.5, purely by his frustration.

2351
02:25:57,980 --> 02:26:00,940
Alright Loki oh, yeah, Lita hokey

2352
02:26:05,740 --> 02:26:07,740
I'll give it like a

2353
02:26:08,020 --> 02:26:14,060
Like it's sick because they didn't even really it doesn't look like that. They paid it just was trying to put his

2354
02:26:14,900 --> 02:26:16,900
Samples in there just to make it like a song

2355
02:26:16,900 --> 02:26:22,900
but it didn't really seem like it came from the back of the soundtrack music, so it's like, I don't know, six, yeah.

2356
02:26:22,900 --> 02:26:24,900
Alright, Jonas, what'd you think?

2357
02:26:24,900 --> 02:26:26,900
I'll give it like a four.

2358
02:26:27,900 --> 02:26:31,900
Well, first of all, there's really not much into the song at all.

2359
02:26:34,900 --> 02:26:37,900
Fuck, shit, fuck.

2360
02:26:37,900 --> 02:26:38,900
Alright.

2361
02:26:38,900 --> 02:26:40,900
Anyone can make a song like that.

2362
02:26:40,900 --> 02:26:47,460
It's like Brad's voice to game.

2363
02:26:47,460 --> 02:26:53,780
Alright, I give it, I know the backbeat sucks, but like, come on, they're saying the f-words,

2364
02:26:53,780 --> 02:26:55,780
that's always funny, I give it an 8.

2365
02:26:55,780 --> 02:26:56,780
I'm a slagwerk!

2366
02:26:56,780 --> 02:26:59,780
Alright, well a slagwerk I give a 10, but we're not talking about a slagwerk.

2367
02:26:59,780 --> 02:27:03,020
I want to make it band and call it slagwerk.

2368
02:27:03,020 --> 02:27:06,100
If I started doing mixes, I would just go as slagwerk.

2369
02:27:06,100 --> 02:27:10,780
Vote now for the Orange Lounge cage match winner, here's your choices, last week's winner,

It looks like what was it?

2383
02:27:35,500 --> 02:27:37,500
I think we're in Secretions.

2384
02:27:37,500 --> 02:27:38,500
Shit.

02:28:18,540 --> 02:28:19,540
No.

02:28:19,540 --> 02:28:20,540

There's a half hour left to show here.

2426
02:29:23,740 --> 02:29:24,740
I like liquor.

2427
02:29:24,740 --> 02:29:25,740
Okay, wait a minute.

2428
02:29:25,740 --> 02:29:26,740
What?

2429
02:29:26,740 --> 02:29:36,740
I just started myself a little character in Jamie's Animal Crossing Town, and I can't get Irene to get off so I can play.

2430
02:29:56,740 --> 02:29:59,740
We need more female input on this show.

2431
02:29:59,740 --> 02:30:00,740
Hey!

2432
02:30:00,740 --> 02:30:02,740
Jamie has to make up for everybody.

2433
02:30:02,740 --> 02:30:04,740
I have tit power.

2434
02:30:04,740 --> 02:30:06,740
I can bring a few females.

2435
02:30:06,740 --> 02:30:09,740
Let's have an all female orange lounge.

2436
02:30:09,740 --> 02:30:10,740
Okay.

2437
02:30:10,740 --> 02:30:12,740
Loki and I will leave town for the weekend.

2438
02:30:12,740 --> 02:30:13,740
We did that.

2439
02:30:13,740 --> 02:30:14,740
Oh yeah, we did that.

2440
02:30:14,740 --> 02:30:15,740
That's right.

2441
02:30:15,740 --> 02:30:16,740
But Ross was there.

2442
02:30:16,740 --> 02:30:19,740
It was me and Jessica, but we had Ross and Dan.

2443
02:30:19,740 --> 02:30:22,740
Hey everybody, do you want Dan to be on the show again?

2444
02:30:22,740 --> 02:30:23,740
Send me your votes.

2445
02:30:23,740 --> 02:30:24,740

2446
02:30:24,740 --> 02:30:31,740

02:30:35,180 --> 02:30:42,180

2448
02:30:42,420 --> 02:30:45,300

2449
02:30:45,300 --> 02:30:47,420
it's weird you know i got

2450
02:30:47,420 --> 02:30:52,420
okay now if you don't like you have no taste my god

2451
02:30:52,420 --> 02:30:56,420
I mean, whenever you work, you have taste.

2452
02:30:56,420 --> 02:30:58,420
Oh, yeah.

2453
02:30:58,420 --> 02:31:00,420
Oh, there's no time to keep holding me, son.

2454
02:31:00,420 --> 02:31:01,420
Anyways, um, I was-

2455
02:31:01,420 --> 02:31:04,420
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.

2456
02:31:04,420 --> 02:31:06,420
You're only helping the situation.

2457
02:31:06,420 --> 02:31:08,420
Anyways, so, um, I was going to talk about-

2458
02:31:08,420 --> 02:31:10,420
There's this weird email I got.

2459
02:31:10,420 --> 02:31:12,420
It's, I guess, some sort of scam that they send you.

2460
02:31:12,420 --> 02:31:18,420
And, um, it is the strangest thing I've ever seen to try to actually, you know,

2461
02:31:18,420 --> 02:31:23,420
get someone's personal info.

2462
02:31:23,420 --> 02:31:30,420
It's actually an email sent to me from this web service that's in India.

2463
02:31:30,420 --> 02:31:40,420
It's from some guy, and it's basically trying to convince you to launder $21 million into the country or some shit like that.

2464
02:31:40,420 --> 02:31:45,420
So I guess I could read it here.

2465
02:31:45,420 --> 02:31:47,420
Sorry, that's the twin male.

2466
02:31:47,420 --> 02:31:49,420
No, twin male.

2467
02:31:49,420 --> 02:31:51,420
Okay, here goes.

2468
02:31:51,420 --> 02:31:57,420
Dear friend, I know this email will reach you as a surprise, but need not to worry,

2469
02:31:57,420 --> 02:32:02,420
as we are using only secured and confidential medium available to seek foreign assistance.

2470
02:32:02,420 --> 02:32:06,420
Yeah, secure and confidential yet is going to someone else and I got the email. Supposedly.

2471
02:32:06,420 --> 02:32:09,420
Matt, why is your butt in my face?

2472
02:32:09,420 --> 02:32:10,420
I don't know.

2473
02:32:10,420 --> 02:32:18,420
Anyways, so, following the sudden death of my husband, General Sonya Batcha, the late former head of state, and I...

2474
02:32:18,420 --> 02:32:20,420
Give us a Cliff Notes version.

2475
02:32:20,420 --> 02:32:28,420
Okay, uh, some guy died, um, I want you to, um, to, uh, move my funds into the United States.

2476
02:32:28,420 --> 02:32:29,420
You made me snort my propel.

2477
02:32:29,420 --> 02:32:43,420
I'll give you 21.5 million dollars for doing that and all you have to do is send me your, let's see, you need to send me your full name, your company name and address and phone numbers and fax numbers.

2478
02:32:43,420 --> 02:32:47,420
And you're sold. To my lawyer.

2479
02:32:47,420 --> 02:32:49,420
And a big black cop.

2480
02:32:49,420 --> 02:32:57,420
So that was the dumb email I got and I thought it was all special and stuff but then other people got the same email so I guess not.

2481
02:32:57,420 --> 02:32:59,420
I mean, I'm not even talking about it.

2482
02:32:59,420 --> 02:33:00,420
But yeah.

2483
02:33:00,420 --> 02:33:02,420
No, just three of us supposed to say that.

2484
02:33:02,420 --> 02:33:07,420
So, yeah. That's all. Pretty stupid.

2485
02:33:09,420 --> 02:33:13,420
Spam sucks. Oh, that's what I was gonna give an FU2 this week and I forgot it alone.

2486
02:33:13,420 --> 02:33:14,420
I got to see Robin Drag.

2487
02:33:14,420 --> 02:33:17,420
Don't talk about that on this show.

2488
02:33:17,420 --> 02:33:19,420
Alright, you can talk about it if you want.

2489
02:33:19,420 --> 02:33:20,420
I got to see Robin Drag.

2490
02:33:20,420 --> 02:33:21,420
Okay.

2491
02:33:21,420 --> 02:33:22,420
It was cool.

2492
02:33:22,420 --> 02:33:23,420
Two, two, one.

2493
02:33:23,420 --> 02:33:24,420
I'm scarred for life.

2494
02:33:24,420 --> 02:33:31,420
We have dead airspace!

2495
02:33:54,420 --> 02:33:56,420
Uh-oh. Now it's tied.

2496
02:33:58,420 --> 02:34:00,420
We need people to hurry up and send their votes.

2497
02:34:00,420 --> 02:34:04,420
Jahi, I got your vote, so you don't have to send that over a message. I already got it.

2498
02:34:04,420 --> 02:34:05,420
Alright.

2499
02:34:05,420 --> 02:34:07,420
We need... we need...

2500
02:34:07,420 --> 02:34:08,420
Irene!

2501
02:34:08,420 --> 02:34:12,420
No, no, no, no. We gotta wait and see if there's any more votes coming in the chatroom.

2502
02:34:12,420 --> 02:34:14,420
Because there's still some people in chatroom who haven't voted yet.

2503
02:34:14,420 --> 02:34:16,420
Yeah, vote. Vote for me.

2504
02:34:16,420 --> 02:34:17,420
So, it's...

2505
02:34:17,420 --> 02:34:18,420
Oh, there's one.

2506
02:34:18,420 --> 02:34:19,420
Oh, let's see.

2507
02:34:19,420 --> 02:34:29,420
We'll give it ten seconds to get what we want in.

2508
02:34:29,420 --> 02:34:32,420
Let's talk about something else.

2509
02:34:32,420 --> 02:34:34,420
How cool Vincent D'Amore is.

2510
02:34:34,420 --> 02:34:39,420
Vincent D'Amore is cool, but he doesn't swear in his songs.

2511
02:34:39,420 --> 02:34:42,420
Do kids swear in Icelandic or something?

2512
02:34:42,420 --> 02:34:44,420
He'd be cooler if he did.

2513
02:34:44,420 --> 02:34:48,420
No, just because something has swearing in it doesn't make it cool.

2514
02:34:48,420 --> 02:34:59,420
SoCal Kicks brings up a good thing we should talk about. I briefly mentioned this after the Milpitas Golf Land interviews, but we are going to be going to Cyberbeat Nation, Orange Lounge Radio. Well, at least I'm going.

2515
02:34:59,420 --> 02:35:02,420
Fuck them, we're scheduling it on Valentine's Day.

2516
02:35:02,420 --> 02:35:08,420
Yeah, you know what, since I'm the single one, Valentine's Day doesn't matter to me this year, so I'm going to go to L.A.

2517
02:35:08,420 --> 02:35:10,420
This is my five year anniversary with Dan.

2518
02:35:10,420 --> 02:35:12,420
Well congratulations you guys, that's really cute.

2519
02:35:12,420 --> 02:35:14,420
Give us presents.

2520
02:35:14,420 --> 02:35:31,420
Well, some other Bimani release, definitely release the second code for DVR Extreme, if anyone cares, you know, release the sync for Extreme, Twinbee, and also Burning the Floor Momo Mix, which has got the retarded speedup in the middle.

2521
02:35:31,420 --> 02:35:34,420
That song would do very good in Trainee Mix 3.

2522
02:35:36,420 --> 02:35:38,420
Unnecessary speedup.

2523
02:35:39,420 --> 02:35:40,420
But, no.

2524
02:35:40,420 --> 02:35:42,420
So yeah.

2525
02:35:42,420 --> 02:35:45,420
That's all.

2526
02:35:45,420 --> 02:35:48,420
Somebody else vote.

2527
02:35:48,420 --> 02:35:50,420
Jenny Bean hasn't voted. Make her vote.

2528
02:35:50,420 --> 02:35:52,420
Jenny Bean vote.

2529
02:35:52,420 --> 02:35:54,420
Who else hasn't voted? No, Tyler hasn't voted.

2530
02:35:54,420 --> 02:35:56,420
Vote for your fellow staff squad person.

2531
02:35:56,420 --> 02:35:58,420
Who hasn't voted? Who am I going to single out here?

2532
02:35:58,420 --> 02:36:00,420
Excel hasn't voted.

2533
02:36:00,420 --> 02:36:01,420
Did Jahi vote?

2534
02:36:01,420 --> 02:36:02,420
Jahi did vote.

2535
02:36:02,420 --> 02:36:06,420
Did VidPower vote?

2536
02:36:06,420 --> 02:36:08,420
No, there he did. He did.

2537
02:36:08,420 --> 02:36:10,420
Oh, Slinky didn't vote.

2538
02:36:10,420 --> 02:36:11,420
Slinky, vote for me.

2539
02:36:11,420 --> 02:36:14,420
Alright, we're naming people now who haven't voted.

2540
02:36:14,420 --> 02:36:15,420
So, alright.

2541
02:36:15,420 --> 02:36:16,420
We're singling you out.

2542
02:36:16,420 --> 02:36:18,420
Oh, okay. We got one from JB. Here we go.

2543
02:36:20,420 --> 02:36:22,420
Oh, that wasn't a vote.

2544
02:36:22,420 --> 02:36:23,420
JB, vote.

2545
02:36:24,420 --> 02:36:25,420
JB, vote.

2546
02:36:25,420 --> 02:36:26,420
It's all on your shoulders.

2547
02:36:27,420 --> 02:36:29,420
Next vote is the final vote.

2548
02:36:29,420 --> 02:36:30,420
Next vote is the final vote.

2549
02:36:30,420 --> 02:36:34,420
And it's going to be the tiebreaker vote, possibly.

2550
02:36:34,420 --> 02:36:41,420
the

2551
02:36:42,860 --> 02:36:44,500
and

2552
02:36:44,500 --> 02:36:46,020
jenny bb votes for

2553
02:36:46,020 --> 02:36:47,500
attitude putting

2554
02:36:47,500 --> 02:36:50,100
now i've got that

2555
02:36:50,100 --> 02:36:52,900
jenny bb breaks the time

2556
02:36:52,900 --> 02:36:55,340
matches over

2557
02:36:55,340 --> 02:36:58,380
for the second week in a row

2558
02:36:58,380 --> 02:36:59,500
it wins

2559
02:36:59,500 --> 02:37:00,460
nice trying

2560
02:37:00,460 --> 02:37:03,620
The OSFPB tried cloning himself to vote again.

2561
02:37:03,620 --> 02:37:06,820
Nice tribe, you were five seconds too late, unfortunately, so...

2562
02:37:06,820 --> 02:37:09,420
Eternity wins again in the second week.

2563
02:37:09,420 --> 02:37:11,200
And uh...

2564
02:37:11,200 --> 02:37:14,500
the Grimshaw one will just have to be saved for the occasional fuck-off show.

2565
02:37:14,500 --> 02:37:16,100
Sorry, kids.

2566
02:37:16,100 --> 02:37:18,940
But yes, I'll send that to you guys that wanted it after the show.

2567
02:37:18,940 --> 02:37:21,560
Or you can visit Tal's website. He has it, but...

2568
02:37:21,560 --> 02:37:26,120
Ask Tal when he comes back on the channel where his website is, because that's where he got it from.

2569
02:37:26,120 --> 02:37:27,420
so the cage match is over

2570
02:37:27,420 --> 02:37:30,620
eternity wins again

2571
02:37:30,620 --> 02:37:32,620

2572
02:37:32,620 --> 02:37:33,860

2573
02:37:33,860 --> 02:37:35,740
i'm not going to play it again

2574
02:37:35,740 --> 02:37:38,340
it already won dammit

2575
02:37:38,340 --> 02:37:41,860
if you want to take a huge break uh... we can play the fly

2576
02:37:41,860 --> 02:37:45,080
i don't want to play that nine minutes on the way

2577
02:37:45,080 --> 02:37:49,540
i don't think any of us will see this game

2578
02:37:49,540 --> 02:37:52,040
alright we got it

2579
02:37:52,040 --> 02:37:53,980

2587
02:38:08,600 --> 02:38:11,840

2588
02:38:11,840 --> 02:38:14,960
moving on uh... moving on to the news

2589
02:38:14,960 --> 02:38:16,560
but it will be

2590
02:38:16,560 --> 02:38:20,040
mmm tastes like muppet

2591
02:38:20,040 --> 02:38:22,520
anything else

2592
02:38:22,520 --> 02:38:25,520
Oh, that's a good erotic song title, Tastes Like Muppet.

2593
02:38:25,520 --> 02:38:27,520
Tastes Like Muppet.

2594
02:38:27,520 --> 02:38:29,520
Umm, what else?

2595
02:38:29,520 --> 02:38:30,520
Is there anything like that?

2596
02:38:30,520 --> 02:38:35,520
Treat me like a Muppet and stick great up your head.

2597
02:38:35,520 --> 02:38:40,520
Puppet Like A Muppet.

2598
02:38:40,520 --> 02:38:42,520
I'm sure you guys could be very creative.

2599
02:38:42,520 --> 02:38:43,520
Ah, such a busy schedule.

2600
02:38:43,520 --> 02:38:45,520
EOSFBB says, Tastes Like Muppet.

2601
02:38:45,520 --> 02:38:46,520
Ooh.

2602
02:38:46,520 --> 02:38:47,520
Ooh.

2603
02:38:47,520 --> 02:38:48,520
Rock the cock.

2604
02:38:48,520 --> 02:38:49,520
Rock the cock.

2605
02:38:49,520 --> 02:38:52,520
Alright, we did the erotic thing like an hour ago. Moving on.

2606
02:38:52,520 --> 02:38:56,520
You know that Candy Cane still makes me think of that Jay and Silent Bob comic?

2607
02:38:56,520 --> 02:38:57,520
What? What one?

2608
02:38:57,520 --> 02:39:03,520
The one where Dante went to see Caitlin in the asylum and started fucking her with the Candy Cane.

2609
02:39:03,520 --> 02:39:05,520
And she woke up and chased him out.

2610
02:39:06,520 --> 02:39:11,520
I need to watch the Clerks cartoon series again just because it rules so much.

2611
02:39:11,520 --> 02:39:12,520
Is it safe?

2612
02:39:13,520 --> 02:39:15,520
It's very safe.

2613
02:39:16,520 --> 02:39:17,520
Has anybody seen any-

2614
02:39:17,520 --> 02:39:23,400
Is it safe?

2615
02:39:23,400 --> 02:39:26,400
Has there been any DDR on TV lately?

2616
02:39:26,400 --> 02:39:27,400
Like on a show?

2617
02:39:27,400 --> 02:39:28,400
No.

2618
02:39:28,400 --> 02:39:31,280
Like I heard it was on Fastlane like three months ago but that's such old news.

2619
02:39:31,280 --> 02:39:35,640
They're gonna be airing a Cyberbeat Nation commercial on TV.

2620
02:39:35,640 --> 02:39:36,640
On TV?

2621
02:39:36,640 --> 02:39:37,640
Yep.

2622
02:39:37,640 --> 02:39:38,640
Where?

2623
02:39:38,640 --> 02:39:39,640
You can go download it off of DDR.

2624
02:39:39,640 --> 02:39:43,920
Yeah but it's a commercial but that doesn't mean it's a real commercial.

2625
02:39:43,920 --> 02:39:46,640
It just seemed like a DDR ego thing.

2626
02:39:46,640 --> 02:39:48,640
I thought that was just an online commercial, like it's just...

2627
02:39:48,640 --> 02:39:49,640
Oh, really?

2628
02:39:49,640 --> 02:39:50,640
Yeah.

2629
02:39:50,640 --> 02:39:52,640
I don't think they're actually gonna air it, no.

2630
02:39:52,640 --> 02:39:53,640
Where would they air it?

2631
02:39:53,640 --> 02:39:54,640
Call me ass fucker.

2632
02:39:54,640 --> 02:39:55,640
Ass fucker?

2633
02:39:55,640 --> 02:40:00,140
Oh my god though, I did download a cool, I mean it's an old commercial, but it was like

2634
02:40:00,140 --> 02:40:03,640
the one of this Nike shoe that they're wearing in Japan.

2635
02:40:03,640 --> 02:40:04,640
No, Nike.

2636
02:40:04,640 --> 02:40:09,140
It's this guy walking past a gigantic shoe in front of a billboard, and all of a sudden

2637
02:40:09,140 --> 02:40:11,640
the shoe transforms into a robot and flies off.

2638
02:40:11,640 --> 02:40:13,640
And the guys are standing there going, blink.

2639
02:40:13,640 --> 02:40:18,200
link but they made a toy of that like 10 of them and they were giving them to

2640
02:40:18,200 --> 02:40:23,360
executives and had one in a giveaway price I went with that was also in a

2641
02:40:23,360 --> 02:40:30,400
magazine for spin magazine came with the little flip book it was pretty much the

2642
02:40:30,400 --> 02:40:35,440
same thing like turn into like a Gundam that's what the football player look

2643
02:40:35,440 --> 02:40:42,440
And he like jumped up and flew away from the other side of the fence going,

2644
02:40:42,440 --> 02:40:45,440
Well, you know, shoot them and do a robot.

2645
02:40:45,440 --> 02:40:51,440
You know, you know what, let's do a segment on this show that we usually do when we're stretching for things to talk about,

2646
02:40:51,440 --> 02:40:52,440
because we have a lot of people here tonight.

2647
02:40:52,440 --> 02:40:53,440
Ask Orange Lounge.

2648
02:40:53,440 --> 02:40:55,440
Yes, you got it. We're going to do Ask Orange Lounge.

2649
02:40:55,440 --> 02:40:57,440
Play Ussalakun.

2650
02:40:57,440 --> 02:40:58,440
I do not have that, do you?

2651
02:40:58,440 --> 02:40:59,440
I don't think I have that.

2652
02:40:59,440 --> 02:41:00,440
I'll send it to you.

2653
02:41:00,440 --> 02:41:03,440
We're going to do the usual Ask Orange Lounge music.

2654
02:41:03,440 --> 02:41:04,440
No!

2655
02:41:04,440 --> 02:41:08,440
Yeah, either you ask Orange Lounge or we play the fly.

2656
02:41:08,440 --> 02:41:10,440
You have your choice.

2657
02:41:10,440 --> 02:41:14,440
Why don't you fly in the background while you're waiting?

2658
02:41:14,440 --> 02:41:15,440
I think it's in there still.

2659
02:41:15,440 --> 02:41:16,440
Is it already in there? Alright.

2660
02:41:16,440 --> 02:41:18,440
So send us those questions to me in the chat room.

2661
02:41:18,440 --> 02:41:26,440
You can ask OrangeLounge or you can ask Zero, you can ask Jonas, or alternatively you can ask Brad and Irene out in the front room.

2662
02:41:26,440 --> 02:41:27,440
You can ask any of us.

2663
02:41:27,440 --> 02:41:28,440
Actually, I have a better song.

2664
02:41:28,440 --> 02:41:30,440
Or Puppy or Ryan.

2665
02:41:30,440 --> 02:41:31,440
The fly isn't that good.

2666
02:41:31,440 --> 02:41:34,440
We can play I've Got Janeiro in there that's really good.

2667
02:41:34,440 --> 02:41:38,440
That was going to be my cage match song, but nine minutes long.

2668
02:41:38,440 --> 02:41:40,440
No, we're doing our During the Wonderland songs. That's what we always do.

2669
02:41:40,440 --> 02:41:41,440
Alright, fine.

2670
02:41:43,440 --> 02:41:45,440
Alright, so ask Orange Lounge. Send me those questions in the chatroom.

2671
02:41:45,440 --> 02:41:47,440
We, we, we, we, we, we, we...

2672
02:41:47,440 --> 02:41:49,440
You can ask Orange Lounge, or you can ask any of our guests.

2673
02:41:49,440 --> 02:41:50,440
Here, you have to play it off of singing it again.

2674
02:41:51,440 --> 02:41:52,440
Here we go.

2675
02:41:53,440 --> 02:41:54,440
Rob, I'd like to ask you a question.

2676
02:41:54,440 --> 02:41:55,440
Really?

2677
02:41:55,440 --> 02:41:57,440
Why are you so fly?

2678
02:41:57,440 --> 02:41:59,440
Why am I so fly?

2679
02:41:59,440 --> 02:42:01,440
Why am I so sexy? Is that why you're asking me?

2680
02:42:01,440 --> 02:42:04,440
No, I'm actually thinking of Peanut Flunky Colma Divas.

2681
02:42:04,440 --> 02:42:05,440
Ask the guy why he's so fly.

2682
02:42:05,440 --> 02:42:06,440
Alright, well let's...

2683
02:42:06,440 --> 02:42:10,440
Why are you so fly for a white guy?

2684
02:42:10,440 --> 02:42:12,440
My last name is white man.

2685
02:42:12,440 --> 02:42:13,440
Okay, first question.

2686
02:42:13,440 --> 02:42:17,440
And people, don't send me your questions over slash notice.

2687
02:42:17,440 --> 02:42:20,440
It's got to come over slash MSG because I might miss them.

2688
02:42:20,440 --> 02:42:22,440
But I caught this one so we'll start with this question.

2689
02:42:22,440 --> 02:42:24,440
SoCalKicks wants to know,

2690
02:42:24,440 --> 02:42:31,440
Can SoCalKicks be a special super duper derpity derp host at CBN?

2691
02:42:31,440 --> 02:42:33,440
He can be our local chorus watcher.

2692
02:42:33,440 --> 02:42:34,440
I don't see why not.

2693
02:43:04,440 --> 02:43:09,440
It's still boring as ever.

2694
02:43:09,440 --> 02:43:12,440
I heard you almost got run over by a cop.

2695
02:43:12,440 --> 02:43:14,440
Yeah, they have cops.

2696
02:43:14,440 --> 02:43:19,440
Yeah, it's all a conspiracy. They're trying to take me out.

2697
02:43:19,440 --> 02:43:26,440
A couple days ago when I was going out late and I found the A&M to get food,

2698
02:43:26,440 --> 02:43:29,440
because the damn dining halls close early,

2699
02:43:29,440 --> 02:43:41,440
I was leaving on my bike and three cop cars come screeching into the gas station parking lot with no lights or sirens on, and one of them almost hit me.

2700
02:43:41,440 --> 02:43:46,440
And yeah, things suck.

2701
02:43:46,440 --> 02:43:50,440
Remember, it's the People's Republic of Davis where they'll find you for breathing.

2702
02:43:50,440 --> 02:43:52,440
This is CBN.

2703
02:43:52,440 --> 02:44:03,440
What I'm thinking, and I need to know what the other hosts think of this, instead of airing the interviews during a show, maybe have it be its own like special that airs like Friday night or something on the station.

2704
02:44:03,440 --> 02:44:04,440
Sure, why not?

2705
02:44:04,440 --> 02:44:10,440
Why not? I'm thinking of doing like a reality radio thing, like actually doing a journal, like saying hey it's Friday morning and we're leaving.

2706
02:44:10,440 --> 02:44:14,440
Because I'm going down there with Mel B and he's always a colorful character to have on the show.

2707
02:44:14,440 --> 02:44:21,440
Brad and Irene might possibly tag along, we all know Brad's funnier than hell and Irene will probably be playing Animal Crossing so she won't say anything anyway.

2708
02:44:21,440 --> 02:44:25,440
I wish I could go, but I'm having an empty house the whole weekend.

2709
02:44:25,440 --> 02:44:30,440
So yes, SoCalCakes, you can be some kind of special, super-duper correspondent there.

2710
02:44:30,440 --> 02:44:35,440
And in the background, we'll have the Atari 5200 going.

2711
02:44:35,440 --> 02:44:36,440
Alright.

2712
02:44:36,440 --> 02:44:41,440
Um, definitely. But I have one of those too, and I do have combat.

2713
02:44:41,440 --> 02:44:45,440
Alright, moving on. More questions.

2714
02:44:45,440 --> 02:44:47,440
Um...

2715
02:44:47,440 --> 02:44:48,440
How did you run through your...

2716
02:44:48,440 --> 02:44:50,440
USFVB wants to know what?

2717
02:44:50,440 --> 02:44:51,940
I haven't read through the list yet.

2718
02:44:51,940 --> 02:44:52,940
What list?

2719
02:44:52,940 --> 02:44:54,940
Video games, because I have no.

2720
02:44:54,940 --> 02:44:56,940
We'll do that just before we finish the show, okay?

2721
02:44:56,940 --> 02:44:57,440
Alright.

2722
02:44:57,440 --> 02:45:00,940
EOSFB wants to know, when will Orange Lounge have the next match game?

2723
02:45:00,940 --> 02:45:01,940
That's an excellent question.

2724
02:45:01,940 --> 02:45:05,940
We were gonna do one tonight, but everything else ran too long,

2725
02:45:05,940 --> 02:45:08,940
because we had the Milpitas interviews and the Fuck You's went on forever, so we're...

2726
02:45:08,940 --> 02:45:10,940
We'll try and get to one next week, okay?

2727
02:45:10,940 --> 02:45:11,940
We'll do one next week.

2728
02:45:11,940 --> 02:45:12,940
We'll do one next week for you.

2729
02:45:12,940 --> 02:45:13,940
We'll show.

2730
02:45:13,940 --> 02:45:21,940
Snubdismoid wants to know, how would one go about passing rhythm and patty?

2731
02:45:21,940 --> 02:45:25,940
Oh, is that an edit? Oh, that's the edit. Loki, tell us about this.

2732
02:45:25,940 --> 02:45:33,940
Rhythm and patty, or R and patty, was Orange Beanie's third place winner, I believe.

2733
02:45:33,940 --> 02:45:39,940
Third place for the hell edits. If you want to try passing it, play it the first stage, and play your first stage on beginner.

2734
02:45:39,940 --> 02:45:42,940
You cannot fail Beginner, the first stage.

2735
02:45:42,940 --> 02:45:45,940
So just play the edit and make sure it's set to Beginner mode.

2736
02:45:45,940 --> 02:45:51,940
And you can try as many times as you want on the first stage and you can't fail it.

2737
02:45:51,940 --> 02:45:56,940
But he did it and I was surprised. I was like, holy shit, he got an A on it or something.

2738
02:45:56,940 --> 02:46:00,940
Yeah, so it's a lot of stamina, but that's about it.

2739
02:46:00,940 --> 02:46:10,940
I'm still thankful for an era that was cooler because it followed the 2DX steps, well, whatever.

2740
02:46:10,940 --> 02:46:15,940
And the rhythm. That'd be huge. I heard it and I was like, oh my god, it's 2DX.

2741
02:46:15,940 --> 02:46:22,940
Well, what went it over the other ones was the crowd reaction for it because everyone was like, oh, that's so cool.

2742
02:46:22,940 --> 02:46:25,940
Alright, moving on. Next question?

2743
02:46:25,940 --> 02:46:29,440
Next question, this one comes from Jaheem, Jake and Attic, our buddy.

2744
02:46:29,440 --> 02:46:32,940
Jake and Attic wants to know, when did Rob first get laid and how was it?

2745
02:46:32,940 --> 02:46:35,940
Well, we do pass your virginity on the way to SoCal.

2746
02:46:35,940 --> 02:46:41,940
For those that don't know, my virginity is actually two exits before Milpitas Golf Land.

2747
02:46:41,940 --> 02:46:45,940
And this is really ironic. No, this is really ironic.

2748
02:46:45,940 --> 02:46:49,940
I lost my virginity the same weekend I saw DDR for the first time.

2749
02:46:49,940 --> 02:46:53,940
Like, many years ago. Like, it was 1.5 mix, like a long...

2750
02:46:53,940 --> 02:46:54,940
Like, two.

2751
02:46:54,940 --> 02:47:03,260
Yeah. So, uh, and how was it? Uh, sorry to say I've had much better since. So, you all

2752
02:47:03,260 --> 02:47:08,060
can wave when you're past Mission Boulevard. There's a Motel 6 right there. Just wave at

2753
02:47:08,060 --> 02:47:13,740
it. I can't believe I just said that on the radio. My mother's crying somewhere. Alright.

2754
02:47:13,740 --> 02:47:21,940
Moving on. Jenny Bean. Can DCB&I be special non-Cyberbeat Nation interview hosts if we

2755
02:47:21,940 --> 02:47:26,900
figure out how to record them for the people that don't know, that don't get to go to Cyberbeat

2756
02:47:26,900 --> 02:47:32,500
Nation. Ha ha ha. Okay, sure, why not? Okay. Alright, you guys want to record something?

2757
02:47:32,500 --> 02:47:38,500
I'm not going by choice because I have my 5 year anniversary and I'm going to get laid.

2758
02:47:38,500 --> 02:47:44,380
Alright. Well I'm just going to get laid anyways. Yeah, gee, I wish I could be crammed into

2759
02:47:44,380 --> 02:47:51,260
a nice small Korean arcade with tons of people there and it being all hot and stuff and crowded.

2760
02:47:51,260 --> 02:47:58,940
Uh, wait, no, that was, no, sorry, don't want to go.

2761
02:47:58,940 --> 02:48:04,020
All right, so, um, I wanted to go just to go to the Price is Right, goddammit, that's

2762
02:48:04,020 --> 02:48:07,780
the only thing I don't, I don't think Mel and I are going to have time to go Price is

2763
02:48:07,780 --> 02:48:11,780
So, we'll see.

2764
02:48:11,780 --> 02:48:15,780
Uh, Jenny Bean, to answer your question, yes.

2765
02:48:15,780 --> 02:48:19,780
You guys make something, we'll air it. For sure. We don't know when.

2766
02:48:19,780 --> 02:48:23,780
If it'll be during the show or maybe like a post-Cyberbeat Nation special show or something.

2767
02:48:23,780 --> 02:48:24,780
Yes, Brad.

2768
02:48:24,780 --> 02:48:28,780
And news. Olivia has left bad-stinning on a Danville.

2769
02:48:28,780 --> 02:48:31,780
We have our Olivia back!

2770
02:48:31,780 --> 02:48:34,780
Yay! Olivia's gone! I'm so happy.

2771
02:48:34,780 --> 02:48:42,540
We got Lee back. Yay! I'm so happy. Good, you can have the bitch.

2772
02:48:42,540 --> 02:48:46,460
Alright, wow. Wow, happy day in Animal Crossing. Oh, happy day!

2773
02:48:46,460 --> 02:48:49,660
You can have that little chick back. Alright, here we go. Moving on.

2774
02:48:49,660 --> 02:48:52,740
Quit traveling between villagers. We're going to lose like all of our villagers.

2775
02:48:52,740 --> 02:48:57,300
You guys keep doing the traveling. Alright, moving on. Shadow.

2776
02:48:57,300 --> 02:49:00,740
Hey, Loki, can we make you into one of those Vert 2 thingies for StepMania?

2777
02:49:00,740 --> 02:49:05,900
you and your burning hair jumping out for the left hand side of the screen

2778
02:49:05,900 --> 02:49:10,840
well let me grow my hair a little bit longer.

2779
02:49:10,840 --> 02:49:17,760
You can get me dressed up for like because in Phantom Man, I'm going to be cosplaying as Ulong the bunny.

2780
02:49:19,880 --> 02:49:24,480
so you can get a picture of me with a pancake on my head, and uh, yeah that'd be fun.

2781
02:49:24,480 --> 02:49:27,660
I would cosplay as Ulong too.

2782
02:49:27,660 --> 02:49:30,660
Rob, do you mind if I cosplay with you?

2783
02:49:30,660 --> 02:49:32,660
You alright, Ed?

2784
02:49:32,660 --> 02:49:37,660
We're gonna cosplay as Ulan, and you know what? I found those old rabbit fur coats from the 80s.

2785
02:49:37,660 --> 02:49:42,660
Since they're already dead and made into coats, we can just cut them up. That'd be cool.

2786
02:49:42,660 --> 02:49:48,660
Oh my lord. Alright, StrongBrad wants to know, can we spot him for cyberbeatination?

2787
02:49:48,660 --> 02:49:51,660
No. Alright. Moving on.

2788
02:49:51,660 --> 02:49:53,660
Sorry, you know.

2789
02:49:53,660 --> 02:49:54,660
What?

2790
02:49:54,660 --> 02:49:58,160
enough. It's hard enough for me to get down there, Christ.

2791
02:49:58,160 --> 02:50:02,160
Vidpowah wants to know, how are your guys' PlayStation 2s modded, if they are modded

2792
02:50:02,160 --> 02:50:05,760
at all? Also, if they are modded, did you do it yourself, or did someone else do it

2793
02:50:05,760 --> 02:50:06,760
for you?

2794
02:50:06,760 --> 02:50:09,480
Sierra, I'm not cheap. I bought a JPS2.

2795
02:50:09,480 --> 02:50:11,040
I also bought a JPS2.

2796
02:50:11,040 --> 02:50:17,920
I attempted to mod mine with a plug mod that's internal, and ever since I tried doing that,

2797
02:50:17,920 --> 02:50:24,600
every now and then it doesn't want to reload my GameShark CD, but I have three plug mods

2798
02:50:24,600 --> 02:50:31,600
that are supposedly going to work in some version of the PS2, I just don't have one.

2799
02:50:32,000 --> 02:50:36,320
The money you're going to spend attempting all those various mod chips, you might as

2800
02:50:36,320 --> 02:50:41,840
well just crack and get the JPS tool. Keep in mind this, is that for every mod that

2801
02:50:41,840 --> 02:50:46,960
comes out, with every new game that comes out, it has the protection. So like, say that

2802
02:50:46,960 --> 02:50:51,680
you want the next 2DX to come out, it ain't going to work. Just, you know, save yourself

2803
02:50:51,680 --> 02:50:58,680
You can get a Japanese PlayStation 2 for cheap, and from what I understand, if anything ever happens to a network video to service secret JPS2s.

2804
02:50:58,680 --> 02:51:04,680
Word of advice, don't use modtips on your PS2s because it's exactly what Jamie said.

2805
02:51:04,680 --> 02:51:07,680
If you do, I'll laugh at you.

2806
02:51:07,680 --> 02:51:15,680
So, you know, maybe there'll be a super special secret one that'll get through someday, but honestly, just get the JPS2 and save yourself the headache.

2807
02:51:15,680 --> 02:51:18,680
You're gonna have one that works for everything after the system's already obsolete.

2808
02:51:18,680 --> 02:51:21,240
make uh... moving on technically

2809
02:51:21,240 --> 02:51:25,320
moving on the u.s. at bb old your body's giving us a website asking us the

2810
02:51:25,320 --> 02:51:28,600
impressions of the site

2811
02:51:28,600 --> 02:51:32,440
and i'm really scared of every else at bb sent me a

2812
02:51:32,440 --> 02:51:33,960
all right

2813
02:51:33,960 --> 02:51:36,940
comma sutra animated

2814
02:51:36,940 --> 02:51:38,160
you know that

2815
02:51:38,160 --> 02:51:40,320
i will uh...

2816
02:51:40,320 --> 02:51:43,560
interesting will look at it more definitely later we got a bunch more

2817
02:51:43,560 --> 02:51:47,120
questions to get to and i think i like the animated picture of the

2818
02:51:47,120 --> 02:51:51,600
the right in the cock there, that's very interesting. That might be my new icon on TDR Freak, what

2819
02:51:51,600 --> 02:51:55,200
do you think? Oh wait, I might get a point for that.

2820
02:51:55,200 --> 02:51:58,160
It'd get removed, you'd have 24 hours to remove it.

2821
02:51:58,160 --> 02:52:04,200
Damn it. Well for that 24 hours it would be hilarious, alright. Moving on. 23rd Magus,

2822
02:52:04,200 --> 02:52:09,720
can we call you a boo-boo kitty fuck? If you were asking that question to Loki, sure.

2823
02:52:09,720 --> 02:52:14,560
Actually, that's my backup name for when I, my name was taken or something. That's what

2824
02:52:14,560 --> 02:52:15,560
it appears at.

2825
02:52:15,560 --> 02:52:20,560
Who is someone in the Fruits community's nickname? Is it Booboo Kittyfug? The Leginal community?

2826
02:52:20,560 --> 02:52:23,560
Yeah, I remember seeing a name called Booboo Kittyfug.

2827
02:52:23,560 --> 02:52:24,560
Alright.

2828
02:52:24,560 --> 02:52:28,560
DCB has a question and it's, hi guys!

2829
02:52:28,560 --> 02:52:30,560
Hi!

2830
02:52:30,560 --> 02:52:33,560
This is the police.

2831
02:52:33,560 --> 02:52:38,560
DCB, put the joke down. Step away from the joke.

2832
02:52:38,560 --> 02:52:41,560
Hi dad, I'm in jail.

2833
02:52:41,560 --> 02:52:43,560
Alright, moving on.

2834
02:52:43,560 --> 02:52:47,060
SoCalKicks wants to know, will you buy me a PlayStation 2 Japanese?

2835
02:52:47,060 --> 02:52:47,560
No.

2836
02:52:47,560 --> 02:52:48,060
No.

2837
02:52:48,060 --> 02:52:50,060
Moving on.

2838
02:52:50,060 --> 02:52:54,060
Damn it, the Matrix is 102 days away, it's 102 days too long.

2839
02:52:54,060 --> 02:52:57,060
Alright, uh, Jake Kinetic wants to know,

2840
02:52:57,060 --> 02:53:01,560
Does anyone know where I can get Japanese hip-hop and R&B romanji lyrics?

2841
02:53:01,560 --> 02:53:06,060
Where is the Lucifer pick the Dark Sacra was supposed to send me, and who's hotter?

2842
02:53:06,060 --> 02:53:09,060
Yoji Kudo or Irvine Kinesis?

2843
02:53:09,060 --> 02:53:11,060
I fucked that up because I'm too honky, sorry.

2844
02:53:11,060 --> 02:53:20,060
Alright, here's what I have to say. As far as the lyrics, I had stuff, but I'll have to go find the sites again.

2845
02:53:20,060 --> 02:53:29,060
As far as the pic of Lucifer, my hard drive was broken a few weeks ago, so that means that I have to find it for you again.

2846
02:53:29,060 --> 02:53:34,060
But just look up Angel's sanctuary. There's actually a really good Japanese set. They've got tons of good Lucifer pictures.

2847
02:53:34,060 --> 02:53:37,060
And as far as Yoji or Irvine... Irvine, dude!

2848
02:53:37,060 --> 02:53:42,060
It's the hair, the trench coat, the shotgun, the hat...

2849
02:53:42,060 --> 02:53:45,060
The only redeeming quality of playing Final Fantasy VIII.

2850
02:53:45,060 --> 02:53:49,060
Yeah, I agree. Irvine's hotter because that was the only redeeming quality of Final Fantasy VIII.

2851
02:53:49,060 --> 02:53:53,060
And Squall was pretty happy because I had the personality of that pancake.

2852
02:53:53,060 --> 02:53:56,060
Squall was a pansy, okay.

2853
02:53:56,060 --> 02:54:01,060
Oh, DCB claims that I love Derby Owners Club more than I love... us.

2854
02:54:01,060 --> 02:54:05,060
The Meaning Orange Lounge, I suppose, or more than the Killer Pals or something like that.

2855
02:54:05,060 --> 02:54:10,060
Um, to be truthful, uh, yes, I do love Derby Owners Club more than any of you. Sorry!

2856
02:54:10,060 --> 02:54:12,060
It's just the way it is. No, I'm kidding!

2857
02:54:12,060 --> 02:54:13,060
Next question!

2858
02:54:13,060 --> 02:54:16,060
It's just a game. Sure, I spent 20 bucks on it the other day, but hey, you know.

2859
02:54:16,060 --> 02:54:22,060
Why can't they have Hookers Owners Club, okay? I want to be a pimp and be able to raise my hookers and be the best prostitutes in the world.

2860
02:54:22,060 --> 02:54:23,060
Why can't they have that?

2861
02:54:23,060 --> 02:54:26,060
Uh, I could totally see that if it were just Golf Lounge.

2862
02:54:26,060 --> 02:54:53,060
My favorite role would have to be at this point the twin dragon role at Tsuchiya, which is

2863
02:54:53,060 --> 02:54:59,460
There's like six types of fish wrapped around, of course, the rice, the nori, and fried lobster

2864
02:54:59,460 --> 02:55:03,960
tail with this really yummy sauce, like, you know, without mustard.

2865
02:55:03,960 --> 02:55:09,760
And then my favorite nigiri roll is, at this time, I would have to say a todo, which is

2866
02:55:09,760 --> 02:55:11,880
a patty tuna.

2867
02:55:11,880 --> 02:55:13,880
I like toast.

2868
02:55:13,880 --> 02:55:17,160
No, I don't like sushi at all.

2869
02:55:17,160 --> 02:55:20,960
I've never tried it, but, you know, me being a picky eater, I don't like sushi.

2870
02:55:20,960 --> 02:55:23,960
It doesn't look okay to you. Sorry to hear that.

2871
02:55:23,960 --> 02:55:27,960
Alright, we're going to take the last few questions here.

2872
02:55:27,960 --> 02:55:33,960
Oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. My favorite role is Sacramento roles, deep fried California roles, because they're fattening and good.

2873
02:55:33,960 --> 02:55:35,960
What's your favorite single role?

2874
02:55:35,960 --> 02:55:36,960
Favorite single role?

2875
02:55:36,960 --> 02:55:38,960
Have you had any before, like unagi, taco?

2876
02:55:38,960 --> 02:55:39,960
Like the sashimi?

2877
02:55:39,960 --> 02:55:42,960
No, that's not sashimi, that's the spaghetti sashimi.

2878
02:55:42,960 --> 02:55:45,960
Um, I'd say unagi.

2879
02:55:45,960 --> 02:55:47,960
Rob likes the eel.

2880
02:55:47,960 --> 02:55:48,960
I do like the eel.

2881
02:55:48,960 --> 02:55:49,960
It's long.

2882
02:55:49,960 --> 02:55:53,960
Alright, we're closing the question asking now. We're going to take the last few questions here.

2883
02:55:58,960 --> 02:56:00,960
Oop, dead air. Sorry about that.

2884
02:56:00,960 --> 02:56:01,960
This music is making me want to kill myself.

2885
02:56:01,960 --> 02:56:04,960
Alright, last question. God damn it, it's another will you buy me question.

2886
02:56:04,960 --> 02:56:08,960
RYC3 wants to know, will you buy me a universal PS2?

2887
02:56:08,960 --> 02:56:09,960
No, there's no such thing.

2888
02:56:09,960 --> 02:56:11,960
No, there's no such thing. Alright.

2889
02:56:12,960 --> 02:56:13,960
That's it.

2890
02:56:13,960 --> 02:56:20,960
the

2891
02:56:22,000 --> 02:56:24,640
uh... columbia the shuttle tragedy

2892
02:56:24,640 --> 02:56:29,600
it's a screen cap cn and it's a shuttle traveling nearly eighteen times speed of

2893
02:56:29,600 --> 02:56:31,600
flight

2894
02:56:31,600 --> 02:56:35,640

2898
02:56:45,880 --> 02:56:49,240

02:56:50,000 --> 02:56:54,200
do the salt pepper shakers on these clues actually hold cocaine and heroin

2901
02:56:54,200 --> 02:56:57,200
total inside over friday yes

2902
02:56:57,200 --> 02:56:59,000
but

2903
02:56:59,000 --> 02:57:01,120
i don't want to see the exit

2904
02:57:01,120 --> 02:57:03,040

2905
02:57:03,040 --> 02:57:06,680
doctor to us no good place to pick up girls

2906
02:57:06,680 --> 02:57:10,240

2908
02:57:13,880 --> 02:57:14,800
old man

2909
02:57:14,800 --> 02:57:18,740
last question so-called kick snow do you think alley larder would be a good

2910
02:57:18,740 --> 02:57:21,400
samus for the metro movie

2911
02:57:21,400 --> 02:57:23,160

2912
02:57:23,160 --> 02:57:25,480
still in place a lot of that i don't want

2913
02:57:25,480 --> 02:57:28,160
uh... what i think your final destination

2914
02:57:28,160 --> 02:57:33,080
who she had brought on those who have been on with other movie was here

2915
02:57:33,080 --> 02:57:34,080
There was another big...

2916
02:57:34,080 --> 02:57:36,080
Rob, I watched movies that don't suck.

2917
02:57:36,080 --> 02:57:38,080
I don't want to say she wasn't that bad.

2918
02:57:40,080 --> 02:57:41,080
What else was she in?

2919
02:57:42,080 --> 02:57:43,080
Would she be a good Samus?

2920
02:57:43,080 --> 02:57:44,080
Eh, she'd be okay.

2921
02:57:44,080 --> 02:57:48,080
It would be better than fucking Angelina Jolie or Mira...

2922
02:57:48,080 --> 02:57:49,080
Just fucking...

2923
02:57:50,080 --> 02:57:51,080
We'd be...

2924
02:57:51,080 --> 02:57:52,080
We'd be away with those people.

2925
02:57:54,080 --> 02:57:55,080
Oh, thank you!

2926
02:57:55,080 --> 02:57:57,080
Okay, Ally Larter wasn't Jay and Silent Bob.

2927
02:57:57,080 --> 02:57:59,080
She was the chick that farted.

2928
02:57:59,080 --> 02:58:00,080
Oh!

2929
02:58:00,080 --> 02:58:01,080
She...

2930
02:58:01,080 --> 02:58:03,080
No, nope, she's too...

2931
02:58:04,080 --> 02:58:06,080
You know who... They need...

2932
02:58:08,080 --> 02:58:11,080
No, no, no. First of all, Samus has green hair.

2933
02:58:12,080 --> 02:58:14,080
They're gonna be making a Metroid movie, yes.

2934
02:58:14,080 --> 02:58:16,080
They need to make... Samus needs to be...

2935
02:58:16,080 --> 02:58:17,080
I weep for the future.

2936
02:58:17,080 --> 02:58:19,080
A freaking powerful-looking woman.

2937
02:58:19,080 --> 02:58:22,080
Because Samus is supposed to be, like, seven feet tall. She's... China.

2938
02:58:22,080 --> 02:58:23,080
I'm wondering why...

2939
02:58:23,080 --> 02:58:26,080
Dude, China would be a fucking kick-ass Samus.

2940
02:58:28,080 --> 02:58:30,080
Uh, loosely lawless. No, um...

2941
02:58:30,080 --> 02:58:32,080
Or the chick that played Gabrielle.

2942
02:58:33,080 --> 02:58:36,080
I want my Samus to have lesbian connotations, Dammit.

2943
02:58:37,080 --> 02:58:42,080
I was wondering why... I mean, I've seen a lot of really shitty ass movies.

2944
02:58:42,080 --> 02:58:45,080
I mean, for instance, I've given out some of those for the Varsity Boys.

2945
02:58:45,080 --> 02:58:49,080
Really? Black Ninja? Okay. Really shitty ass movies.

2946
02:58:49,080 --> 02:58:51,080
Why hasn't the D.D.R. movie come out?

2947
02:58:51,080 --> 02:58:55,080
I mean, even some really cheap ass studio could pick this stuff up for next to nothing.

2948
02:58:55,080 --> 02:59:02,080
and nothing. I'm just surprised that it hasn't been, like, released.

2949
02:59:06,200 --> 02:59:09,800
I'm still voting for Lucy Lawless with a kick-ass.

2950
02:59:09,800 --> 02:59:13,200
Yeah, Lucy Lawless with a kick-ass.

2951
02:59:13,200 --> 02:59:16,800
And SoCalKicks is stomping and pouting because he said he saw the end of

2952
02:59:16,800 --> 02:59:18,320
Metroid Prime and she's a blonde.

2953
02:59:18,320 --> 02:59:23,680
Um, actually, so is Super Metroid, but I'm referring to the first Metroid. If you put in the code

2954
02:59:23,680 --> 02:59:27,680
Justin Bailey. Samus has green hair.

2955
02:59:27,680 --> 02:59:31,680
And you know Justin Bailey is not actually a name.

2956
02:59:31,680 --> 02:59:35,680
It's actually referring to just wearing underwear.

2957
02:59:35,680 --> 02:59:39,680
It's an Australian thing. Because Bailey is a beast.

2958
02:59:39,680 --> 02:59:43,680
So that's where it came from. Justin Bailey.

2959
02:59:43,680 --> 02:59:47,680
Yes, I'm full of old video game knowledge. Sue me.

2960
02:59:47,680 --> 02:59:51,680
I have to go through my list, but no one cares.

2961
02:59:51,680 --> 02:59:52,680
I'll go through the list.

2962
02:59:52,680 --> 02:59:53,680
Do it.

2963
02:59:53,680 --> 02:59:54,680
It would take me a long time.

2964
02:59:54,680 --> 02:59:55,680
You want to save it for next week then?

2965
02:59:55,680 --> 02:59:56,680
Um, I'll go through the list.

2966
02:59:56,680 --> 02:59:57,680
Who wants to know what I have?

2967
02:59:57,680 --> 02:59:58,680
Do it.

2968
02:59:58,680 --> 02:59:59,680
Okay.

2969
02:59:59,680 --> 03:00:00,680

2978
03:00:52,680 --> 03:00:59,680

2979
03:01:00,760 --> 03:01:07,760
kind that's more comfy. We got it for five bucks. Anyway, oh no, I have a Sega CD and

2980
03:01:07,760 --> 03:01:14,760
a Sega CD and a Sega CDX. No. Actually I might, I might have a night drive. Um, as

2981
03:01:14,760 --> 03:01:20,760
far as, ok, for Atari I have 2600, 250200s, I have the 4 port and the 2 port 5200s. Um,

2982
03:01:20,760 --> 03:01:26,760
I have the Lynx, I have Cliccovision, I have the expansion module 1 and 2, so I can play

2983
03:01:26,760 --> 03:01:33,760
Turbo. Um, I have an Intellivision. I do, I have a Turbo Duo. Um, think about Turbo

2984
03:02:03,760 --> 03:02:09,760
I've got a stack of old style PlayStations, including the first model.

2985
03:02:09,760 --> 03:02:11,760
I have a PS1.

2986
03:02:11,760 --> 03:02:13,760

2987
03:02:13,760 --> 03:02:15,760
I have an Xbox.

2988
03:02:15,760 --> 03:02:17,760
Um, I have...

2989
03:02:17,760 --> 03:02:22,760
I do not have 3DO, but we almost bought a CDI right before Game Masters went out of business.

2990
03:02:22,760 --> 03:02:24,760
Um...

2991
03:02:24,760 --> 03:02:26,760
I have a Connectrix.

2992
03:02:26,760 --> 03:02:28,760
We're looking for a Vectrex.

2993
03:02:28,760 --> 03:02:31,760
Um, Mattel? What did Mattel do?

2994
03:02:34,760 --> 03:02:36,760
I almost bought a Pico.

2995
03:02:36,760 --> 03:02:37,760
I thought that was an Intelli-

2996
03:02:37,760 --> 03:02:38,760
The Sega Pico?

2997
03:02:38,760 --> 03:02:41,760
Because they were selling it for ten bucks and I was a mobile.

2998
03:02:43,760 --> 03:02:46,760
Um, I have a Neo Geo cartridge system.

2999
03:02:46,760 --> 03:02:48,760
I have a Neo Geo CD.

3000
03:02:49,760 --> 03:02:55,760
Do you know how Dan got that? Dan got our Neo card by trading a Sega CD for it.

3001
03:02:55,760 --> 03:03:04,760
Back then they didn't know, and we actually are still picking up our cartridge plus, we picked up the COF2000.

3002
03:03:04,760 --> 03:03:06,760
How much was that?

3003
03:03:06,760 --> 03:03:10,760
We got it for just over 300.

3004
03:03:10,760 --> 03:03:12,760
What else do I have?

3005
03:03:12,760 --> 03:03:14,760
Oh yeah, I have a Wonderswan color.

3006
03:03:14,760 --> 03:03:18,760
We have two Neo Geo Pocket colors in the Neo Geo Pocket.

3007
03:03:18,760 --> 03:03:24,760
And I might have exhausted the list if there's anything else I don't remember because I know I've got other stuff.

3008
03:03:24,760 --> 03:03:25,760
Okay.

3009
03:03:25,760 --> 03:03:26,760
So.

3010
03:03:26,760 --> 03:03:27,760
Wow.

3011
03:03:27,760 --> 03:03:28,760
You own a lot.

3012
03:03:28,760 --> 03:03:29,760
That's like forty-something, I think.

3013
03:03:29,760 --> 03:03:30,760
Disgusting.

3014
03:03:30,760 --> 03:03:31,760
Oh well.

3015
03:03:31,760 --> 03:03:32,760
But fun.

3016
03:03:32,760 --> 03:03:33,760
Your house is a video game museum.

3017
03:03:33,760 --> 03:03:34,760
It really is.

3018
03:03:34,760 --> 03:03:40,760
And don't forget the Transformers and Valkyries that are littering my house.

3019
03:03:40,760 --> 03:03:42,760
You can come over to my house.

3020
03:03:42,760 --> 03:03:43,760
Seriously.

3021
03:03:43,760 --> 03:03:45,760
I'm afraid because the movie pile that I have in my house is starting to creep towards my

3022
03:03:45,760 --> 03:03:47,760
bed and I think it's coming after me.

3023
03:03:47,760 --> 03:03:48,760
Yikes.

3024
03:03:48,760 --> 03:03:49,760
Okay, we gotta wrap this show.

3025
03:03:49,760 --> 03:03:51,440
We're already running like five minutes late.

3026
03:03:51,440 --> 03:03:52,880
Any final thoughts from you folks?

3027
03:03:52,880 --> 03:03:53,880
I want Boba.

3028
03:03:53,880 --> 03:04:02,880
I need to finish my website.

3029
03:04:02,880 --> 03:04:07,880
Zero, any final thoughts? Thanks for being here tonight.

3030
03:04:07,880 --> 03:04:10,880
No problem. I'd come back whenever you wanted.

3031
03:04:10,880 --> 03:04:13,880
I don't know. I would say if I was Willy Wonka, I would be really rich.

3032
03:04:13,880 --> 03:04:18,880
And for the Stiffle and Ollie fans, they'll know what I mean by get the fat kid out of my chocolate milk.

3033
03:04:18,880 --> 03:04:20,880
And that's it.

3034
03:04:20,880 --> 03:04:23,880
Rock, Jonas, any final thoughts?

3035
03:04:23,880 --> 03:04:26,880
Well, not much. I haven't spoken as usual as much.

3036
03:04:26,880 --> 03:04:30,880
But, um, I'll be back next week again.

3037
03:04:30,880 --> 03:04:31,880
Cool.

3038
03:04:31,880 --> 03:04:33,880
This time probably on time.

3039
03:04:33,880 --> 03:04:36,880
You can play match game next week.

3040
03:04:36,880 --> 03:04:38,880
Oh, sure.

3041
03:04:38,880 --> 03:04:43,880
Alright, be ready at five o'clock or so, maybe.

3042
03:04:43,880 --> 03:04:44,880
Yeah, they can't hear your little exchanger.

3043
03:04:44,880 --> 03:04:45,880
No, that was just dead air. What did you say?

3044
03:04:45,880 --> 03:04:46,880
Yeah, dead air. Anyway.

3045
03:04:46,880 --> 03:04:49,880
I said I'm going to come back with them because I'll be ready at five o'clock because I wouldn't have.
