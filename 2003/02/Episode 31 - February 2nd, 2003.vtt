00:00.000 --> 00:11.680
Do you want to hear the most annoying fan in the world?

00:11.680 --> 00:20.080
You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio, the Monty Talk, and then some.

00:20.080 --> 00:27.080
Orange Lounge may contain adult content. Orange Lounge may contain many four letter words.

00:27.080 --> 00:30.080
Orange Lounge may contain a scene of nudity.

00:30.080 --> 00:34.080
Orange Lounge may contain hot monkey sex.

00:34.080 --> 00:37.080
Just kidding, Orange Lounge will not contain hot monkey sex. In this episode...

00:42.080 --> 00:44.080
Hey, are there any balls down there?

00:44.080 --> 00:46.080
About the biggest party I've ever seen, Dingleberry.

00:46.080 --> 00:49.080
What's your favorite security movie?

00:49.080 --> 00:53.080
Showgirls. Absolute frightful. What's yours?

00:53.080 --> 00:56.080
There are no stupid questions, just stupid people.

00:56.080 --> 00:59.080
Don't torture yourself. That's my job.

00:59.080 --> 01:01.080
Now's the time on sprockets and we dance!

01:02.080 --> 01:04.080
I don't get you, my pretty!

01:04.080 --> 01:06.080
And your little dog, too!

01:06.080 --> 01:07.080
I don't come through.

01:07.080 --> 01:10.080
I'm sorry, but all questions must be submitted in writing.

01:10.080 --> 01:12.080
Why did they have to take the word gay?

01:13.080 --> 01:14.080
No!

01:14.080 --> 01:17.080
All I want to expect for a Spanish expression is Hindu.

01:17.080 --> 01:19.080
Hey!

01:21.080 --> 01:22.080
Shut up!

01:22.080 --> 01:23.080
Where's my gun?

01:23.080 --> 01:45.280
My name is Rob Roberts and this is episode number 31 for February 2nd of 2003.

01:45.280 --> 01:50.080
You're tuned into the Bamani Scene's most grounded radio station of all things B-Money.

01:50.080 --> 01:52.920
My name is Rob Roberts and you might know me as Sky.

01:52.920 --> 01:57.680
as always, are my awesome co-hosts. In the invisible corner is the happiest bunny on

01:57.680 --> 02:02.400
the farm, Miss Jamie Summers. You know her better as DarkSakurai. She's running in here

02:02.400 --> 02:03.720
like a chicken with a head cut off. What's up?

02:03.720 --> 02:06.720
I re-picked my most funny. Oh, okay, cool.

02:06.720 --> 02:07.920
I love you, buddy. Did you?

02:07.920 --> 02:08.920
I love you, buddy. Thank you.

02:08.920 --> 02:09.920
I love you, buddy. Thank you.

02:09.920 --> 02:10.920
I love you, buddy. I love you, buddy.

02:10.920 --> 02:15.920
All right. And you get... We have horrible mic noise again tonight, and I swear to God,

02:15.920 --> 02:19.920
I fixed this problem before the show started. It's pissing me off. I'll see what I can do.

02:19.920 --> 02:24.420
I'll see what I can do during the first break.

02:24.420 --> 02:29.200
Also say hello to our other lovely co-host, or I should say more handsome co-host, I don't

02:29.200 --> 02:30.660
think he likes to be called lovely.

02:30.660 --> 02:35.720
Our handsome co-host, say hello to Artem Masaloki.

02:35.720 --> 02:38.620
Also with us tonight, we have a whole buffet of guests in the studio.

02:38.620 --> 02:44.640
Say hello to Brad, and we haven't had this gentleman on the show before, but say hello

02:44.640 --> 02:46.640
Go To Zero!

02:46.640 --> 02:48.640
Hey, how's it going?

02:48.640 --> 02:50.640
Also out in the other room playing Animal Crossing's Irene.

02:50.640 --> 02:52.640
She probably won't be on the show because she always plays Animal Crossing.

02:52.640 --> 02:54.640
And Pancakes!

02:54.640 --> 02:56.640
Pancakes!

02:56.640 --> 02:58.640
I want to know something.

02:58.640 --> 03:00.640
Where's Dave?

03:00.640 --> 03:02.640
I've missed Dave. He's been out on the show a long time.

03:02.640 --> 03:04.640
Dave, are you listening?

03:04.640 --> 03:06.640
You should be over here right now.

03:06.640 --> 03:08.640
I don't know. That is a good question.

03:08.640 --> 03:10.640
Where has Dave been?

03:10.640 --> 03:12.640
He hasn't been here for a few weeks.

03:12.640 --> 03:21.640
Puppy and Tal are at Scandinavia. They were there for Tal's birthday and they were supposed to be here by now, but they're not.

03:21.640 --> 03:24.640
So that means punishment.

03:24.640 --> 03:30.640
So yeah. Hello. So we're going to talk about a whole bunch of stuff tonight.

03:30.640 --> 03:35.640
We have interviews from the tournament that happened on Friday at Milpitas Golf Land. We've got those.

03:35.640 --> 03:38.640
I know tons of you are just looking forward to that.

03:38.640 --> 03:42.840
And, uh, we'll get to everything else a bit later, but first we're going to take a quick break,

03:42.840 --> 03:47.640
and, uh, I thought we'd start off this first break with some Twispy!

03:47.640 --> 03:49.640
Oh, any other opening thoughts to the folks here?

03:49.640 --> 03:51.640
Oh, did the missing people just show up?

03:51.640 --> 03:52.640
Oh, let's say hello to them.

03:52.640 --> 03:53.640
Oh, there they are!

03:53.640 --> 03:54.640
You're late.

03:54.640 --> 03:55.640
You're late.

03:55.640 --> 03:56.640
Shut the fuck up, man.

03:56.640 --> 03:58.640
What's up? Okay, we have Tal. Say hello to Tal.

03:58.640 --> 03:59.640
Hi.

03:59.640 --> 04:01.640
And then we have Puppy. Puppy's here.

04:01.640 --> 04:02.640
Hi.

04:02.640 --> 04:05.640
And then, in the back, there's Ryan.

04:05.640 --> 04:07.640
Oh, shut the fuck up, man.

04:07.640 --> 04:08.640
What?

04:08.640 --> 04:09.640
Chock-a-da-ball.

04:09.640 --> 04:10.640
I don't know.

04:10.640 --> 04:11.640
You know what that means, right?

04:11.640 --> 04:12.640
Okay.

04:12.640 --> 04:13.640
Chock-a-da-ball.

04:13.640 --> 04:16.640
Oh, I received a message from the chatroom.

04:16.640 --> 04:19.640
Snub just told me Davis and Houston are visiting the grandparents.

04:19.640 --> 04:20.640
That's where Davis is.

04:20.640 --> 04:23.640
Well, we were asking where Davis is.

04:23.640 --> 04:26.640
Dude, what the fuck is that?

04:26.640 --> 04:27.640
What happened?

04:27.640 --> 04:30.640
I heard a can of soda open.

04:30.640 --> 04:31.640
Oh.

04:31.640 --> 04:36.640
But Mountain Dew's not supposed to smell like that, yo.

04:36.640 --> 04:38.640
It's always exciting here at Orange Mountain Dew.

04:38.640 --> 04:40.640
Red Red Mountain Dew smells like a fart.

04:43.640 --> 04:45.640
What the hell is this? DNL?

04:46.640 --> 04:48.640
It's 7-Up upside down. What is this?

04:50.640 --> 04:54.640
DNL is basically the opposite of 7-Up, as in the logo is upside down,

04:54.640 --> 04:56.640
and instead of being a green bottle with clear liquid,

04:56.640 --> 04:59.640
it's a clear bottle with green liquid inside.

04:59.640 --> 05:02.640
It's caffeinated instead of just being fucking normal.

05:02.640 --> 05:06.640
It tastes like 7-Up with a kick of Mountain Dew, and it's actually really good.

05:06.640 --> 05:10.640
Yeah, but this year I've been drinking, like, day and night, and it's, like, better than Blue.

05:10.640 --> 05:11.640
Let me smell it.

05:11.640 --> 05:12.640
It's okay.

05:14.640 --> 05:15.640
It's okay. It's alright.

05:15.640 --> 05:19.640
Okay, we're gonna take a break now. We'll come back and talk about all the, uh...

05:19.640 --> 05:22.640
Yeah, search is what I was gonna say. It's kinda like search. Anyway.

05:22.640 --> 05:23.640
I like search.

05:23.640 --> 05:24.640
We'll take a quick break.

05:24.640 --> 05:25.640
I hate Mountain Dew.

05:25.640 --> 05:28.640
And we'll be back to talk about all sorts of fun things, get to those interviews,

05:28.640 --> 05:29.400
views

05:29.400 --> 05:32.980
maybe place of the mind that it was with some of our favorite stuff

05:32.980 --> 05:36.500
and uh... taking your calls just kidding store

05:36.500 --> 05:40.500

05:40.500 --> 05:42.500
Haha

07:10.500 --> 07:12.500

08:10.500 --> 08:23.500
I don't think I'm gonna get a plan, baby I don't think I'm gonna get a plan, baby

08:40.500 --> 08:49.500
If the music come on, get up and dance If the music get up, get up and dance

08:49.500 --> 08:57.500
If you feel it in your bones, yeah I suggest you get it on, girl

08:57.500 --> 09:07.500
Hey, you bet not blow this chance, nah If the music get up and dance, yeah, yeah, yeah

I'll say we're grooving, groove it, groove it until your honor's done

And we're grooving, groove it, groove it, groove it until your honor's done

09:19.240 --> 09:22.200
And then we're grooving, babyatory

09:22.200 --> 09:25.860
We're grooving, groove it, groove it, groove it until your honor's done

09:28.700 --> 09:32.720
Yow, yeah, yeah

10:59.880 --> 11:02.880
If that's what you mean.

11:02.880 --> 11:04.880
Yeah sure, that's what I meant.

11:04.880 --> 11:11.880
Well open up your present, Loki's given Tao a present here.

11:11.880 --> 11:14.880

Use your nails dammit.

11:17.880 --> 11:24.880

11:28.600 --> 11:31.600
We have a holy shit. Gee golliness.

11:31.600 --> 11:35.320
Wow, there's like so much animes in here.

11:35.320 --> 11:37.740
Rupan...

11:37.740 --> 11:41.540
Whoa, why are you still sticking that in my face? Because we want to hear what you've got.

11:41.540 --> 11:44.680
Um, name an anime and it's probably in here.

11:44.680 --> 11:51.680
Or at least ones that haven't come out yet, like Noir and KK and Jay, or, I'm sorry, In America, His and Hers, stupidest goddamn translation of a name ever.

11:52.680 --> 11:53.680
Nuku Nuku!

11:53.680 --> 11:54.680
What's this?

11:54.680 --> 11:56.680
Ooh, now what is this shit here?

11:57.680 --> 12:00.680
That's like that old-school game Crossfire.

12:00.680 --> 12:01.680
Yes!

12:01.680 --> 12:02.680
Crossfire was cool.

12:02.680 --> 12:04.680
This thing is rad!

12:04.680 --> 12:08.680
But the big box that it came in's got, like, cool anime people on it and, like, shit, it looks tight.

12:08.680 --> 12:09.680
Okay, you know what?

12:09.680 --> 12:10.680
What?

12:10.680 --> 12:13.680
Someone needs to bring Crossfire to this show and we're gonna have a Crossfire tournament.

12:13.680 --> 12:25.680
Alright, that game right there, that is Beyblade. It's Fighting Tops. Can you believe that they made an anime about people fighting tops? It's the most retarded thing ever.

12:25.680 --> 12:27.680
You believe this chick has missile boobs.

12:27.680 --> 12:33.680
No, allow me to read the back of the Beyblade DVD.

12:33.680 --> 12:38.680
As a young Beyblader, Tyson has a dream to be the best Blader in the world.

12:38.680 --> 12:44.680
Feeling confident with his technique, Tyson decides to challenge Kai, the leader of the undefeated Blade Sharks.

12:44.680 --> 12:46.680
Does it say Challenge God?

12:46.680 --> 12:47.680
Kai.

12:47.680 --> 12:49.680
Oh, so now they have a Digimon character in here.

12:49.680 --> 12:53.680
Yes. Unfortunately, Tyson is crushed by the awesome power of Kai's blue blade.

12:53.680 --> 12:57.680
Vowing revenge, he begins his quest to rebuild his Beyblade!

12:57.680 --> 12:59.680
Oh my god, this is the fruitiest goddamn thing ever!

12:59.680 --> 13:03.680
But once, we did talk about Golden Stream

13:03.680 --> 13:05.680
Yes, we did talk about Golden Stream

13:05.680 --> 13:09.680
So, why is it that all you Bimani freaks are into anime?

13:09.680 --> 13:13.680
Why is it that all the anime freaks are into Bimani is what you mean, right?

13:13.680 --> 13:15.680
We were here first

13:15.680 --> 13:21.680
Well, I mean, it's like, um...

13:21.680 --> 13:24.680
What the hell is Black Lion? I haven't even looked at it yet.

13:24.680 --> 13:26.680
You don't know Black Lion?

13:26.680 --> 13:28.680
Man, old school.

13:28.680 --> 13:31.680
Well, not really old school, but it's still pretty old.

13:31.680 --> 13:35.680
You know, if you'd only entered the edit contest, you would have probably won that.

13:35.680 --> 13:37.680
What edit contest?

13:37.680 --> 13:40.680
The one that was on Friday?

13:40.680 --> 13:42.680
The one that you missed?

13:42.680 --> 13:44.680
I went to go play 2DX, not edit.

13:44.680 --> 13:46.680
Whatever.

13:46.680 --> 13:48.680
I'm sorry.

13:48.680 --> 13:53.680
I can't make edits. My edits are like Bemani ruler edits. They're crappy.

13:53.680 --> 13:55.680
If I make you an edit, will you give me some porn?

13:56.680 --> 13:58.680
Uh, okay.

14:02.680 --> 14:03.680
Rob.

14:03.680 --> 14:05.680
Rob, put this in your butt.

14:05.680 --> 14:08.680
Hi, what's up? Sorry, I'm trying to work on that sound problem.

14:08.680 --> 14:10.680
Nice hosting job, Rob.

14:10.680 --> 14:16.680
We've got background issues today, so I'm trying to get rid of some of that background noise for you guys listening.

14:16.680 --> 14:18.680
So does everyone else hear it?

14:18.680 --> 14:19.400
Yeah.

14:19.400 --> 14:21.240
I hear it a little bit.

14:21.240 --> 14:26.200
They're also having a little bit of a hard time hearing you,

14:26.200 --> 14:28.960
Jamie, so you've got to give head to the mic.

14:28.960 --> 14:30.680
How's that?

14:30.680 --> 14:31.680
Is that better?

14:31.680 --> 14:36.360
Let me, I'm going to turn down our volume a little bit so that,

14:36.360 --> 14:38.200
I'm going to turn down our mic volume,

14:38.200 --> 14:39.760
but everybody's going to have to talk super loud,

14:39.760 --> 14:40.600
or they're not going to be able to hear you.

14:40.600 --> 14:41.600
So go down a little bit.

14:41.600 --> 14:42.520
That's not a problem.

14:42.520 --> 14:44.000
All right.

14:44.000 --> 14:44.800
Beautiful.

14:44.800 --> 14:47.440
Let's talk to the person that has never been here before.

14:47.440 --> 14:48.040
Oh, great.

14:48.040 --> 14:49.240
What's up, Zero?

14:49.240 --> 14:50.040
Nothing much.

14:50.040 --> 14:52.200
So what brings you here to the studio tonight?

14:52.200 --> 14:53.560
You invited me last week.

14:53.560 --> 14:55.360
Oh, yeah.

14:55.360 --> 14:57.200
So how did you get?

14:57.200 --> 14:59.840
Isn't Zero X old?

14:59.840 --> 15:01.080
What do you mean?

15:01.080 --> 15:03.240
Because on that thread that was on the side of the line.

15:03.240 --> 15:04.480
As old as you are, pal.

15:04.480 --> 15:06.880
As old as you are.

15:06.880 --> 15:08.360
Because I remember, like, Vandalous

15:08.360 --> 15:09.680
is saying, like, you are the oldest one.

15:09.680 --> 15:11.560
And then underneath that was, like, you guys

15:11.560 --> 15:13.960
and that whole senior citizen squad over there.

15:13.960 --> 15:14.960
Hey!

15:14.960 --> 15:16.960
Hey, wait a minute!

15:16.960 --> 15:18.960
I feel great now.

15:18.960 --> 15:21.960
So how did you get into this whole stupid arrow-smashing game?

15:21.960 --> 15:26.960
Um, found it one day when I was on a vacation down Santa Cruz, then heard RBGL.

15:26.960 --> 15:28.960
Oh god, you started playing at the boardwalk?

15:28.960 --> 15:29.960
Yeah.

15:29.960 --> 15:30.960
Oh shit.

15:30.960 --> 15:31.960
The worst of the world.

15:31.960 --> 15:33.960
Isn't that where they filmed The Lost Boys?

15:33.960 --> 15:35.960
Yep, it sure is.

15:35.960 --> 15:38.960
My, um, one of my fiance's friends is a DJ there.

15:38.960 --> 15:39.960
Really?

15:39.960 --> 15:40.960
DJ Tripp.

15:40.960 --> 15:43.960
I haven't heard of them, but I've heard.

15:44.960 --> 15:49.960
Anyways, yeah, I started playing there, and then I heard the horrible-ass RVGL had it.

15:49.960 --> 15:52.960
So I started playing there when it was good, and then...

15:52.960 --> 15:54.960
Well, it was a horrible-ass back when we started.

15:54.960 --> 15:57.960
Not back then, but now it is. That's why I said it was good back then.

15:57.960 --> 16:00.960
23rd Magus had a funny new nickname for Roseville Golf Land.

16:00.960 --> 16:03.960
Could you post that in the chatroom so I can read it, because it was funny.

16:03.960 --> 16:07.960
Well, I mean, RVGL, when we started, dude, it had the 4th mix with USA and stuff.

16:07.960 --> 16:08.960
They were God, dude.

16:08.960 --> 16:16.960
It was fun to play. The first time I saw Kick the Can Doubles, it was like, oh my god, there's someone playing doubles, and it's Kick the Can, hard song ever.

16:16.960 --> 16:17.960
Yeah, I know.

16:17.960 --> 16:30.960
But, you know, things happen and people change, and then they get Max instead of getting our 4th Plus or our 5th Mix, and then they get Max 2, and we still have the USA and Max 2, and then they get, what is it now, 4th Plus?

16:30.960 --> 16:31.960
4th Plus and Max.

16:31.960 --> 16:32.960
Extreme?

16:32.960 --> 16:33.960
Or Extreme now.

16:33.960 --> 16:36.960
Who cares? I don't follow that crap.

16:36.960 --> 16:41.840
I got yelled at on, because you know, there's been kind of in the Sacramento community and

16:41.840 --> 16:44.680
Orange Launch World headquarters happens to be in Sacramento, and I know there's a lot

16:44.680 --> 16:48.280
of you not in Sacramento listening, but of course if you listen to this show enough you've

16:48.280 --> 16:51.280
kept up on Sacramento politics because all we ever do is bitch.

16:51.280 --> 16:54.480
That's what we're best at.

16:54.480 --> 16:57.120
A lot of us are boycotting Roosevelt Golf Land because we're sick of their shit and they

16:57.120 --> 16:58.120
don't upgrade their games.

16:58.120 --> 17:03.460
I got bitched at on DDR Freak because I went to Roosevelt Golf Land and got high scores

17:03.460 --> 17:07.380
on the machine, and somebody was like, well, if you're boycotting Rod's Oak Golf Land,

17:07.380 --> 17:09.940
how come you have scores on the machine, hmm?

17:09.940 --> 17:14.500
Oh my God. Who dug with Kobe up, and why the fuck is he bugging us, though?

17:14.500 --> 17:18.820
Somebody gave me tokens for free anyway, so it wasn't like I didn't really cross the line.

17:18.820 --> 17:20.380
You know, how am I going to pass out DDR?

17:20.380 --> 17:23.940
It's like this, okay? I'm going to go to Golf Land, because I have tons of tokens I bought

17:23.940 --> 17:28.220
down on Piedis Golf Land. No, I'm not going to drive two hours to go spend these tokens

17:28.220 --> 17:31.680
at another Golf Land. They can go, you know, kiss my ass for that. I already spent the

17:31.680 --> 17:36.280
money at Golfland. Golfland already has my money. It would be a waste if I didn't.

17:36.280 --> 17:40.960
That's exactly what my point of view is. If I've still got token to Golfland, there's

17:40.960 --> 17:45.120
a drum mania machine there that works on occasion, and when it works, I can pump tokens in and

17:45.120 --> 17:50.600
fuck it up and then leave. I've used up all mine, and now that my car

17:50.600 --> 17:54.760
is tested and fixed and everything, I'm going to be heading my butt to Milpitas to play

17:54.760 --> 17:59.120
the horsie racing game. Speaking of Golfland and Milpitas Golfland,

17:59.120 --> 18:04.120
If you're just joining us, we do have the interviews from Milpitas tournament that took place on Friday.

18:04.120 --> 18:06.120
We'll get to those a little later when we're ready.

18:06.120 --> 18:08.120
Whatever.

18:08.120 --> 18:09.120
Let's talk more to zero.

18:09.120 --> 18:13.120
So, are you a PA-er or a freestyler?

18:13.120 --> 18:15.120
Freestyler. One of the few.

18:15.120 --> 18:16.120
Ah.

18:16.120 --> 18:17.120
Anymore.

18:17.120 --> 18:18.120
So what kind of freestyle do you do?

18:18.120 --> 18:20.120
Here's the next big question then.

18:20.120 --> 18:22.120
Are you an improver or a routiner?

18:22.120 --> 18:26.120
I would kind of say more routine than improv.

18:26.120 --> 18:28.120
Just because this is stuff I know.

18:28.120 --> 18:32.120
I freestyle what you guys all call like 18, like all the old stuff.

18:32.120 --> 18:33.120
Oh, you're old school?

18:33.120 --> 18:34.120
Yeah.

18:34.120 --> 18:35.120
That's cool.

18:35.120 --> 18:36.120
So you like to like rate bars and-

18:36.120 --> 18:37.120
No, I don't do-

18:37.120 --> 18:38.120
Oh, you don't do-

18:38.120 --> 18:39.120
I don't touch the bar any-

18:39.120 --> 18:40.120
Really?

18:40.120 --> 18:41.120
How do you do 18 freestyle without touching the bar?

18:41.120 --> 18:42.120
Just don't touch it.

18:42.120 --> 18:43.120
Just do everything else, but-

18:43.120 --> 18:46.120
See, 18 is all about the bar and the knees, bro.

18:46.120 --> 18:47.120
Yeah, I do-

18:47.120 --> 18:48.120
The bar, knees, and hands.

18:48.120 --> 18:49.120
I do knees.

18:49.120 --> 18:51.120
I do everything else, but I don't touch the bar.

18:51.120 --> 18:55.120
Dude, today I saw Loki doing his XC edit again, and he did the little freeze bit and then

18:55.120 --> 18:58.480
freeze bit and then dropped his knees out and you could just see his face just go like

18:58.480 --> 18:59.480
oh motherfuck.

18:59.480 --> 19:03.720
Yeah it's like my thing, I mean like when it comes to swinging my legs over the bar

19:03.720 --> 19:07.280
and stuff I just don't touch the bar when I spin, that's it, because I hate the bar.

19:07.280 --> 19:10.780
The bar is icky and slimy because everyone else does it.

19:10.780 --> 19:14.100
I know and everybody's like all sweating because they're playing D.R. and their little mitts

19:14.100 --> 19:17.920
are all over the bar and then they have like a lot of bars have those little black padding

19:17.920 --> 19:19.960
things on them that just soak up all that crap.

19:19.960 --> 19:22.280
I watched a guy wipe his head on those bars.

19:22.280 --> 19:23.280
Oh gross.

19:23.280 --> 19:25.280
That's the reason I don't touch them.

19:25.280 --> 19:28.280
I once put them between my legs and I rode them.

19:28.280 --> 19:30.280
And it was good.

19:30.280 --> 19:32.280
And that's why we don't touch the bars.

19:32.280 --> 19:34.280
I saw someone get nutted on one.

19:34.280 --> 19:36.280
We were there for that.

19:36.280 --> 19:38.280
When Rick flipped Timmy.

19:38.280 --> 19:40.280
Oh yeah.

19:40.280 --> 19:43.280
I got that nickname for Roswell Golf Land by the way from 23 Maggots.

19:43.280 --> 19:46.280
He's calling it Runny Venerio Gooland.

19:46.280 --> 19:48.280
That was pretty good.

19:50.280 --> 19:52.280
Yeah, haha. We're so mature.

19:52.280 --> 19:54.280
Did you hear that one, Jamie?

19:54.280 --> 19:56.280
Run Even Ariel Gooland.

19:58.280 --> 20:00.280
That made me smile.

20:01.280 --> 20:03.280
Oh my gosh, hot.

20:03.280 --> 20:08.280
USFBB, I have to ask a question to this because this is kind of a running question about freestyle on the show.

20:08.280 --> 20:15.280
Zero, why is it that throughout all the routines that we've seen, nobody ever whips their cock out at the end?

20:15.280 --> 20:19.280
I think somebody would probably call the police or something if you get kicked out.

20:19.280 --> 20:24.280
You know, it's the whole thing of the pants you wear to DDR, just don't come down so quickly.

20:24.280 --> 20:26.280
Because if they came down quickly, you'd fall over yourself.

20:26.280 --> 20:29.280
I don't know, depending on the cock, I'd give them a high score.

20:29.280 --> 20:31.280
That's probably why most people don't do it.

20:31.280 --> 20:34.280
You know, there's a lot of people who say that there's a lot of gay people in the DDR community.

20:34.280 --> 20:36.280
This is probably why!

20:36.280 --> 20:39.280
Bust that neurotic song, whip out your cock, and then just...

20:39.280 --> 20:41.280
Kakumei, right? Isn't that the way it works?

20:41.280 --> 20:46.280
If there's girls that can get up there and push their boobs together and call it a routine, then you know...

20:46.280 --> 20:48.280
Well, you know...

20:48.280 --> 20:50.280
Last message.

20:50.280 --> 20:52.280
Last message.

20:52.280 --> 20:58.280
Uh, yeah, that was all inspired because the OSFB was suggesting that someone could whip their cock out and rub it on the bar.

20:58.280 --> 21:00.280
That would be sick.

21:00.280 --> 21:02.280
That would be bar raping.

21:02.280 --> 21:04.280
Another reason you don't touch the bar.

21:04.280 --> 21:06.280
Oh my god, that's so true.

21:06.280 --> 21:08.280
I have little mini bars running around.

21:08.280 --> 21:10.280
Damn, dude.

21:10.280 --> 21:21.280
Wouldn't it be funny if somebody got up there to do a routine and then like, you know, whipped out like a cooler with all this liquor in it and said, look, I'm holding on to the bar.

21:21.280 --> 21:22.280
That was interesting.

21:22.280 --> 21:23.280
The bar?

21:23.280 --> 21:26.280
Yes, I get it.

21:26.280 --> 21:32.280
You are not the wind.

21:32.280 --> 21:36.280
I want to do an episode of Orange Lounge with a gong.

21:36.280 --> 21:40.280
Dude, we would be fucking whacking that thing left and right.

21:40.280 --> 21:46.280
No little gong either. I want to wheel a giant gong in here and put it in the back.

21:46.280 --> 21:51.280
We actually have one at our work. Every time someone gets a new customer, they hit the gong.

21:51.280 --> 21:55.280
I kid you not. You'd be talking on the phone and sitting here.

21:55.280 --> 21:58.280
Customer's like, what was that? What are you talking about? I don't hear anything.

21:58.280 --> 22:00.280
It's hilarious.

22:00.280 --> 22:04.280
Speaking of which, tonight I'm going to be uploading a few pictures from Orange Land Radio

22:04.280 --> 22:07.400
because the fact that you know I've got my digital camera here and I've got a

22:07.400 --> 22:12.680
website that was given to me nicely enough not yet because it's not up yet

22:12.680 --> 22:17.240
but I'll let you guys know by next week when all my shit is up and ready I

22:17.240 --> 22:21.160
believe Jamie is pulling her eye down and sick your tongue at me in the anime

22:21.160 --> 22:29.760
girl fashion I'm not sure why though yeah yeah I'll get around to mine when I

22:29.760 --> 22:36.040
I get around the mine. No more deadlines. I'm not, I don't like being imposed, you know,

22:36.040 --> 22:39.720
all these deadlines enforced on me. They'll come up whenever, you know.

22:39.720 --> 22:42.520
But yeah, I'm going to take like a handful of pictures, because I've been taking pictures

22:42.520 --> 22:45.960
for my whole birthday weekend in Chittenden, so I figure if I grab a few from here, I'll

22:45.960 --> 22:51.520
stick them on there. Besides, um, I wasn't going to ask, we've

22:51.520 --> 22:56.000
been getting a lot of listeners through that Leech from Loki site, so where are you advertising

22:56.000 --> 23:01.120
that site besides the show, because you're already getting a lot of hits apparently.

23:01.120 --> 23:06.120
Everyone that emails me and goes, why aren't you updating your site, because there's a

23:06.120 --> 23:07.120
new site.

23:07.120 --> 23:08.120
Oh.

23:08.120 --> 23:09.120
Oh.

23:09.120 --> 23:11.720
Did you hear that I started a new sim file, even though I haven't finished the old one?

23:11.720 --> 23:12.720
What'd you start?

23:12.720 --> 23:13.720
A new one.

23:13.720 --> 23:15.840
I'm not going to tell you what song, but you know.

23:15.840 --> 23:17.400
I'll tell you what song off-air.

23:17.400 --> 23:21.880
Well, obviously the listeners will know later on, but I did a remix today.

23:21.880 --> 23:24.080
Ah, yes, we're going to hear that, huh?

23:24.080 --> 23:25.080
Yes.

23:25.080 --> 23:30.080
There might be a wicked sim file to go with that.

23:30.080 --> 23:32.080
Oh, you'll have to listen to it.

23:32.080 --> 23:35.080
You'll find out, won't you, little boy?

23:35.080 --> 23:38.080
Yeah, okay.

23:38.080 --> 23:40.080
Hey, why don't you give us a sim update, Logy?

23:40.080 --> 23:43.080
Well, I wish there was something to update on.

23:43.080 --> 23:45.080
There really isn't much going on.

23:45.080 --> 23:46.080
Let's see here.

23:46.080 --> 23:48.080
Bimani's cell, DJ Paranot is taking a break.

23:48.080 --> 23:52.080
I'm putting up the DDR Extreme files because he's tired.

23:52.080 --> 23:54.080
I can understand that.

23:54.080 --> 23:59.080
Do you know what happened to the DDR Extreme files that were on DMI Style? They're gone.

23:59.080 --> 24:05.080
They're re-uploading them with backgrounds and sync steps and full steps and that kind of thing.

24:05.080 --> 24:13.080
But if you're looking for DDR Extreme stuff, there's some people that are uploading stuff to BumaniSims.com. You can find stuff there.

24:13.080 --> 24:19.080
It's kind of like another site that was doing the exact same thing as I was doing, which was going to have people being able to upload their own files.

24:19.080 --> 24:22.760
your own files. Of course, it's kind of very basic, and they just have a CGI script, which

24:22.760 --> 24:26.920
you can do stuff. Of course, I'm going to be making full, beautiful web pages as soon

24:26.920 --> 24:29.680
as I get my site up, and, yeah.

24:29.680 --> 24:30.680
Sure you are.

24:30.680 --> 24:38.400
I am. I'm just working on downloading, er, I'm working on sorting 2,000 files, you know.

24:38.400 --> 24:39.400
It's kind of difficult.

24:39.400 --> 24:46.240
Simple. You just put them in alphabetical order by game and song and artist and BPM.

24:46.240 --> 24:47.240
No, it's not going to work.

24:47.240 --> 24:48.240
And BPM and...

24:48.240 --> 24:50.240
What did you do?

24:50.240 --> 24:53.240
Jamie's been taking random pics with my digicam

24:53.240 --> 24:57.240
and from, oh my god, she's doing the dancer pose, it's so gay

25:00.240 --> 25:02.240
Hey, that's not a bad picture, that's pretty good

25:02.240 --> 25:08.240
There's some cool stuff I got, like last night I got the Axifoli techno theme, that was kind of funny

25:08.240 --> 25:12.240
DWI 2.40? Did that come out?

25:12.240 --> 25:16.240
Well, it might have, but I don't use DWI anymore, so that means nothing to me

25:16.240 --> 25:21.240
But for those who do, there's been new DWI versions coming out.

25:21.240 --> 25:29.240
Actually, DWI now supports Winamp plug-ins, I believe, for visualizations and that kind of shit.

25:29.240 --> 25:34.240
So that's out. Plus, they've been supporting Lyrics for a while, which is kind of cool.

25:34.240 --> 25:36.240
Then there's going to be the new version.

25:36.240 --> 25:44.240
There's going to be the new StepMania that they're working on right now that's going to be supporting what's done in 2DX and BeatMania.

25:44.240 --> 25:48.240
Dude, if you haven't played Belovin' on Xtreme, you've gotta play it.

25:48.240 --> 25:50.240
Greatest fucking song ever.

25:50.240 --> 25:52.240
So, we have that, and they're releasing it now.

25:52.240 --> 25:54.240
Oh my god, play Belovin' at the commercial break. You have to play Belovin' at the commercial break, come on.

25:54.240 --> 25:57.240
Oh my god, it's on, be made in fuckin' 7th mix.

25:57.240 --> 25:59.240
OST.

25:59.240 --> 26:01.240
Greatest song ever.

26:01.240 --> 26:03.240
It seriously is. You have to play it. Like, play it now.

26:03.240 --> 26:04.240
If I can find it!

26:04.240 --> 26:07.240
Oh dude, I played Little Bitches' Oni Steps today.

26:07.240 --> 26:11.240
They're hella fun. I was, like, surprised that they were actually really well done.

26:11.240 --> 26:16.240
I mean, all of the oni steps for like these stupid gay songs, like uh, I'm sorry, not gay songs,

26:16.240 --> 26:22.240
rather, these old songs from DVR First Mix, and they're, the butterfly oni steps are pretty cool-looking,

26:22.240 --> 26:26.240
the little bitch oni steps are cool, the, the Dom Deere Rom oni steps are cool, I mean-

26:26.240 --> 26:28.240
They're not, there are no oni steps for Dom Deere.

26:28.240 --> 26:36.240
Okay, well the Dom Deere Rom video is cool, uh, but I, it's amazing these old-school songs that they put onis to, and shit like that.

26:36.240 --> 26:38.240
Oh, because they fucked up on the steps the first time!

26:38.240 --> 26:41.240
Well no dude, Butterfly Basic is still one of the best hits ever.

26:42.240 --> 26:44.240
It's something like Beat On Extreme?

26:45.240 --> 26:46.240
Uh, no.

26:46.240 --> 26:48.240
Shit. What about, um...

26:50.240 --> 26:51.240
Uh, anyways.

26:51.240 --> 26:52.240
So, um...

26:52.240 --> 26:53.240
What do I do with my camera?

26:53.240 --> 26:54.240
Oh, here we go.

26:54.240 --> 26:55.240
Yeah.

26:56.240 --> 26:57.240
Um, there's a, yeah.

26:58.240 --> 27:00.240
Um, let's see here, what else?

27:00.240 --> 27:03.240
Oh yeah, uh, DWI Insanity, I think I mentioned this last week,

27:03.240 --> 27:08.560
last week. They've got Easy to Dancer sim files now, or their DWIs for Easy to Dancer

27:08.560 --> 27:15.560
songs. So check those out. See, aside from all that stuff, there's not really much going

27:15.560 --> 27:20.760
on. There's another style, 2003, some sim file contest that's going to be going on for

27:20.760 --> 27:28.760
a while. Supposedly, it's like, I believe the entries are due sometime in April or so,

27:28.760 --> 27:33.960
and then they're judging them in September, kind of a waste away there, but whatever.

27:33.960 --> 27:41.960
So there's that one, and I'm sure Turn You Mix 3 will be sometime this summer, er, 4, I mean Turn You Mix 4, sometimes this summer, and uh...

27:41.960 --> 27:42.960
And now?

27:42.960 --> 27:52.160
Yeah, and the really crappy DDR Extreme skins for StepMania, I mean, it's alright, but I think the one for DWI looked much better.

27:52.160 --> 27:59.160
One problem with step manias, instead of saying perfects and greats it says hi guys and bye guys and all this crap like that.

27:59.160 --> 28:02.160
It is so horrible. I laughed for a month on just one.

28:02.160 --> 28:09.160
It's the skin thing. You're going to hear about this during the interviews because we talked to some of the folks from Killer Pals.

28:09.160 --> 28:11.160
That's their whole little joke is the hi guys and bye guys thing.

28:11.160 --> 28:15.160
See the thing is that can be easily fixed. I fixed that instantly.

28:15.160 --> 28:20.160
I'm still playing off of the SM Match 2 skin, because that's my favorite one so far.

28:22.160 --> 28:24.160
And now this kicking of Rob is brought to you by Propel.

28:24.160 --> 28:26.160
Hey! Ow!

28:27.160 --> 28:28.160
You suck.

28:28.160 --> 28:30.160
They had ass-flavored Propel. Damn it, we should give this to you.

28:30.160 --> 28:32.160
Why do they have ass-flavored Propel?

28:32.160 --> 28:33.160
It's lemon.

28:34.160 --> 28:36.160
That's all they had at Walgreens earlier today was lemon.

28:36.160 --> 28:37.160
Lemon!

28:37.160 --> 28:38.160
Bleh.

28:38.160 --> 28:39.160
Well, it's not that bad.

28:39.160 --> 28:40.160
I spit on lemon.

28:40.160 --> 28:41.160
It's not that good either.

28:41.160 --> 28:42.160
Bleh.

28:42.160 --> 28:43.160
Pooey.

28:43.160 --> 28:45.160
Okay, you want to do FUs of the Week?

28:45.160 --> 28:45.660
Yes!

28:45.660 --> 28:48.660
Alright, we'll take a break and then do FUs, how's that?

28:48.660 --> 28:49.160
Okay.

28:49.160 --> 28:51.160
Alright, we're going to take a break, we'll come back and do the FUs of the Week,

28:51.160 --> 28:54.160
so you can send those to me over private messages in the chatroom,

28:54.160 --> 28:56.660
or to our email, OrangeLoungeRadioYahoo.com.

28:56.660 --> 28:59.160
And if you're not in our chatroom, why the hell aren't you?

28:59.160 --> 29:02.160
Get over to our website, http colon slash slash,

29:02.160 --> 29:05.660
OrangeLounge.SKIE.CX.

29:07.160 --> 29:10.160
And after the FUs of the Week, we'll think about doing those mopedis interviews.

29:10.160 --> 29:11.160
How's that sound?

29:11.160 --> 29:26.160
We will be right back, by request from Tal, because he's such a baby. We're gonna hear Belovin' and Daikonkai. Alright, we'll be back.

31:41.160 --> 31:43.160
Yeah

33:41.160 --> 34:10.360
Hi, this is Melby of RTF.

34:10.360 --> 34:16.360
And for an extra $1.99 a minute, my girlfriend, Melvie, can join us on all the fun together.

34:16.360 --> 34:22.360
Hey, if you're a broke-ass like I am, why don't you come to the one place that costs absolutely nothing to go to and still the fun is just as great?

34:22.360 --> 34:29.360
It's Orange Lounge Radio, Sunday nights. Kick it with me and you just might realize the best things in life are free.

34:52.360 --> 34:58.360
How did I get on your friend list? And Samia's like, well Tal, it's not like you ever update your live journal anyways.

34:58.360 --> 35:02.360
I mean, no one talks. When you update, it's like, oh my god, you updated for the first time.

35:02.360 --> 35:09.360
Being a force physicist, given how much I update, especially my verbal vomit lately.

35:09.360 --> 35:12.360
Your posts are starting to look like mine.

35:12.360 --> 35:15.360
Well, I've had a bad week, okay? I'm not normally angst bubble.

35:15.360 --> 35:17.360
Nice triforce.

35:17.360 --> 35:22.360
Isn't that a cool triforce? My uncle made it for me in India. It's made out of silver, so I don't think you can pick it up and post it later.

35:22.360 --> 35:23.360
Okay.

35:23.360 --> 35:24.360
So yes, are we still filming?

35:24.360 --> 35:25.360
No.

35:25.360 --> 35:28.360
Oh, it like bombed out quite some time ago, but...

35:28.360 --> 35:35.360
We cut out the chat room we pinged out of during the break, so we got kind of screwed up there, so...

35:35.360 --> 35:36.360
Send the FUs here.

35:36.360 --> 35:40.360
We're back now though, but you can resend your FUs to us if you're in the chat room.

35:40.360 --> 35:41.360
Yeah.

35:41.360 --> 35:46.360
So send those FUs to me over private message, and if you sent it while I was gone, obviously I didn't get them.

35:46.360 --> 35:50.960
So I only have FUs from Stress, 23 Maggots, Dark Tetsuya, and DCB at this point.

35:50.960 --> 35:54.560
So if you're not on that list, send them to me over IRC or...

35:54.560 --> 35:55.260
Email!

35:55.260 --> 35:57.260
Email, OrangeLawnsRadioYahoo.com

35:57.260 --> 35:59.960
So, let's...

35:59.960 --> 36:01.660
I say we go ahead and get started.

36:01.660 --> 36:02.160
Alright.

36:02.160 --> 36:02.960
We're going to do TerraMix.

36:02.960 --> 36:04.460
Alright, you want TerraMix this week?

36:04.460 --> 36:04.760
Yes.

36:04.760 --> 36:05.960
Alright, we're going to do the FUs of the Week.

36:05.960 --> 36:09.360
So we have some new listeners tonight because earlier today...

36:09.360 --> 36:12.360
Earlier today I spammed the DDR LiveJournal community,

36:12.360 --> 36:16.360
so I know we're going to have some new listeners tonight to explain what the FUs of the Week is all about.

36:16.360 --> 36:20.360
This is where we get angsty, bitchy, and we tell you all about it.

36:20.360 --> 36:25.360
But you get to participate too, but you don't get to say it yourself, we do, because we have microphones and therefore the power.

36:25.360 --> 36:27.360
Yes. Very well. Very well put.

36:27.360 --> 36:31.360
But, this is, um, just start it. They'll figure it out.

36:31.360 --> 36:33.360
Alright, here we go, FUs.

36:33.360 --> 36:34.360
Because we're a complete moron.

36:34.360 --> 36:36.360
Starting with the one and only.

36:36.360 --> 36:43.360
We're not morons. If you're listening to us, you're not a moron.

36:46.460 --> 36:48.460
This is fucked up.

36:48.460 --> 36:52.460
I always have to wait for that. That's what you do.

36:52.460 --> 36:56.460
Anyway, my first psyche of the week goes toward wall games.

36:56.460 --> 36:58.860
We're not having dairy or peach flavored Propell.

36:58.860 --> 37:02.860
I'm having only lemon, which is the ass of all flavors of Propell.

37:02.860 --> 37:06.860
Although not that bad, because of the sound that everyone can see, it's not the best.

37:06.860 --> 37:11.860
So, ass to ass, that certainly is butt track.

37:11.860 --> 37:21.860
Um, my other fucking of the week goes to this ugly bitch that was driving behind me yesterday when I was following, uh, Jabberwocky, running Aaron.

37:21.860 --> 37:26.860
Dude, Dark Sakura goes psychotic in the car, it is awesome.

37:26.860 --> 37:32.220
In the two minutes I was in there, I was just like, wow, waiting for the, you know, big

37:32.220 --> 37:36.420
hella hard level three super to come out and turn us all into ash with these, what is it,

37:36.420 --> 37:41.700
lights, lights, lights went forward, some, some, some, you know, her, the dark Sakura

37:41.700 --> 37:42.700
super.

37:42.700 --> 37:43.700
The Harugoku.

37:43.700 --> 37:44.700
Yes.

37:44.700 --> 37:45.700
Yeah, and it just kicks your ass seven ways from Sunday.

37:45.700 --> 37:46.700
Hey, I'm trying to be angsty here.

37:46.700 --> 37:47.700
Give me that.

37:47.700 --> 37:48.700
Ooh, two microphones.

37:48.700 --> 37:49.700
Bah.

37:49.700 --> 37:51.200
Here, gimme that.

37:51.200 --> 37:52.700
Ooh, it's a microphone.

37:52.700 --> 37:54.200
Bah!

37:54.200 --> 37:57.200
Um, as my view goes toward, um...

37:59.200 --> 38:01.200
Oh, shit. I don't know what else to-

38:01.200 --> 38:04.200
Oh, yeah, I was talking about the ugly bitch behind me.

38:04.200 --> 38:05.700
Okay.

38:05.700 --> 38:07.700
No, not you. Here.

38:07.700 --> 38:15.200
Um, anyway, I'm trying to keep following distance, you know, which is how you're supposed to drive, by law.

38:15.200 --> 38:18.400
I used to keep up three seconds following distance climbs

38:18.400 --> 38:21.200
and this one, every time I'd stop, she'd be right up on my bumper

38:21.200 --> 38:25.200
and I always leave, you know, about a foot between me and the next car

38:25.200 --> 38:27.200
Welcome to California, here's your license

38:27.200 --> 38:29.200
She was fucking ugly though

38:29.200 --> 38:31.200
and I would look in my rearview mirror and there'd be this face

38:31.200 --> 38:35.200
Okay, and me normally, I'm not, I'm not one to say about how people look

38:35.200 --> 38:37.200
I'm normally not that superficial

38:37.200 --> 38:40.200
I don't care how big somebody is, I don't care what they look like

38:40.200 --> 38:43.200
The chicken last message looked like a horse

38:43.200 --> 38:46.200
But I am not superficial like that.

38:46.200 --> 38:48.200
But I'm sorry, this woman scared me.

38:48.200 --> 38:52.200
She had this, I think, condition.

38:52.200 --> 38:54.200
But she looked like a...

38:56.200 --> 38:59.200
A skin condition or like missing a nose condition or what?

38:59.200 --> 39:01.200
She looked like a rhinoceros.

39:02.200 --> 39:06.200
She had these folds of skin where skin should not have folds.

39:06.200 --> 39:09.200
And then her eyes were shrunken deep into her head.

39:09.200 --> 39:15.200
And her eyes looked swollen. And then she had like really ugly hair.

39:15.200 --> 39:21.200
It was like really curly and she would bump my car.

39:21.200 --> 39:27.200
So finally I hit a stop sign and I just stayed there.

39:27.200 --> 39:30.200
I stayed there for three minutes.

39:30.200 --> 39:32.200
And I didn't let her go.

39:32.200 --> 39:35.200
She would start to turn, I would just be bored and just...

39:35.200 --> 39:42.200
So, then I immediately went on my way, and eventually the bitch turned, and something got me clean as I was, like, happy.

39:42.200 --> 39:45.200
And then this other ugly person got behind me.

39:45.200 --> 39:49.200
And she was almost as scary, but not quite as bad, but she was just as bad as the driver.

39:49.200 --> 39:53.200
Oh my God, I hate people here. I do not really hate everyone.

39:53.200 --> 39:56.200
And then...

39:56.200 --> 39:58.200
How do we at least go through this?

39:58.200 --> 40:01.200
You're not supposed to, it's my fucking own school.

40:01.200 --> 40:04.200
Is that it, or do you have more?

40:04.200 --> 40:14.200
I had another one that, just remembering that woman's face, sort of gave me an involuntary lobotomy.

40:14.200 --> 40:19.200
Not actually having the front lobe of my brain, but just having it listed inert.

40:22.200 --> 40:27.200
And by the way, you can look up inert at www.inertionary.com. It's called I-N-E-R-C.

40:27.200 --> 40:32.200
I-N-E-what?

40:32.200 --> 40:36.200
It hurts!

40:36.200 --> 40:41.200
Moving on, next FV of the Week. Lowkey, let's hear it.

40:41.200 --> 40:45.200
We didn't want to grab the microphone.

40:45.200 --> 40:50.200
Okay, first FV of the Week goes to the stupid news coverage of the Space Hill.

40:50.200 --> 40:53.200
Listen, to be honest, you're a dumbass.

40:53.200 --> 41:00.200
So, some retard that was building space shuttle forgot to put a freaking, no, heat sensitive tile on the wing.

41:00.200 --> 41:03.200
And that, oh, I guess caused the shuttle to burn up at Mach 18.

41:03.200 --> 41:08.200
Not to mention that the Columbia is the oldest space shuttle. It was an operation.

41:08.200 --> 41:09.200
It doesn't matter.

41:09.200 --> 41:13.200
Twenty fucking years old. That thing should not be retrofitted.

41:13.200 --> 41:14.200
It shouldn't be in space.

41:14.200 --> 41:18.200
Shut up! I'm talking! Not you! I'm talking.

41:18.200 --> 41:20.200
I'm learning that you are.

41:20.200 --> 41:27.480
stop talking anyway anyway so um yeah what did they not know it was actually al-qaeda

41:27.480 --> 41:32.680
they sent me a skyscraper up into the sky that's what pissed me off about all this news coverage

41:32.680 --> 41:37.640
yes the columbia blowing up is a tragedy you know anytime people die it's sad but like the media

41:37.640 --> 41:43.720
blew it up into this like huge event where it was like oh my god iraq like snuck a bomb on the plane

41:43.720 --> 41:44.720
and blew people up.

41:44.720 --> 41:52.720
Now, the people that I fell bad for, like everybody else, were the people who were actually

41:52.720 --> 41:55.720
involved in it, like NASA, the government, the family.

41:55.720 --> 41:59.720
And the friends that I had just saw it happen.

41:59.720 --> 42:01.720
Anyway, my cousin who knew them all.

42:01.720 --> 42:02.720
Wow, don't care.

42:02.720 --> 42:03.720
Okay, anyways.

42:03.720 --> 42:04.720
Hold on a sec.

42:04.720 --> 42:07.720
I feel bad for the government.

42:07.720 --> 42:10.720
Let me finish, goddammit, or you're going to be added to the list.

42:10.720 --> 42:13.720
I didn't have to pay for this, and it's gonna come out of my pocket.

42:40.720 --> 42:44.720
Ever since the stupid thing blew up, we had sensor failure in the left wing.

42:44.720 --> 42:47.720
Maybe the trouble started in the left wing?

42:47.720 --> 42:53.720
Yahoo, it's Reuters. It's a British news reporter.

42:53.720 --> 42:58.720
It doesn't matter, they still suck.

42:58.720 --> 43:04.720
It doesn't matter, they still suck. They're still covering people that are getting hurt imitating jackass stuff.

43:04.720 --> 43:07.720
Even though the show's been off the TV for like, you know, over a year now.

43:07.720 --> 43:09.720
I don't know, you sound like you're a Yakuza.

43:37.720 --> 43:47.240
seen and like that guy that was quote-unquote the word like okay now I'm

43:47.240 --> 43:56.880
sure you're anyway I'm sure that you know at the time the freak experiment

43:56.880 --> 44:01.120
with the cow and pig jeans brought together to make some weird human but it

44:01.120 --> 44:05.520
might have been a good idea at the time but no it wasn't and you really suck and

44:05.520 --> 44:09.280
And I'm also sick and tired of the secret people that are whining because they're like,

44:09.280 --> 44:12.880
I PARTIED AND I CAN'T SING NOW.

44:12.880 --> 44:15.380
I'M FAMOUS ALREADY.

44:15.380 --> 44:17.380
I'M GOING TO BE FAMOUS NO MATTER WHAT.

44:17.380 --> 44:31.380
The person who I have spectrophotically never tried to try out is the one who came in with a snake bite with a, uh, uh, sorry, uh, brown recluse, boyfriend, bite, and still sang very well.

44:31.380 --> 44:37.180
yeah

44:37.180 --> 44:40.580
alright, enough of that, now we're going to go back to the reoccurring

44:40.580 --> 44:46.940
after you of stupid drivers

44:46.940 --> 44:53.220
I mean, listen

44:53.220 --> 44:55.580
old people should not drive

44:55.580 --> 44:57.700
cars, let alone large vans

44:57.700 --> 45:00.460
let alone large vans coming towards me

45:00.460 --> 45:06.460
Listen, when you're turning, you're not supposed to turn into the oncoming traffic, you're supposed to turn into, you know, traffic going the same way.

45:06.460 --> 45:09.460
So, I don't like you looking at me and all of a sudden,

45:09.460 --> 45:11.460
Oh, I'm not supposed to turn in that lane where there's a car!

45:11.460 --> 45:13.460
But yeah.

45:13.460 --> 45:19.460
So, yeah, an F.U. for me, missing, uh, stupid, uh, raffle in Animal Crossing.

45:22.460 --> 45:24.460
My girlfriend, she was burning my game.

45:26.460 --> 45:27.460
My turn, my turn?

45:27.460 --> 45:28.460
Yeah.

45:28.460 --> 45:29.460
Alright, yay!

45:29.460 --> 45:32.960
As of this week, I have a new F.U. theme.

45:32.960 --> 45:35.460
I've ditched Pequod for something much better.

45:36.960 --> 45:38.960
Dancer, ladies and gentlemen, coming to F.U. theme.

45:38.960 --> 45:39.960
Because I love this song.

45:39.960 --> 45:41.460
And actually, Tal suggested it.

45:41.460 --> 45:43.460
Dude, this song is like the fucking shit.

45:43.460 --> 45:47.460
I mean, my Uber, golf, industrial head roommate sits there and like,

45:47.460 --> 45:50.960
Oh my god, if DDR had more songs like this instead of that fucking Poppy shit,

45:50.960 --> 45:51.960
I'd play it all day and night.

45:51.960 --> 45:53.960
Anyway, can I get my F.U.s? Thank you.

45:53.960 --> 45:55.460
My F.U.s are actually Bomani-related.

45:55.460 --> 45:56.960
Well, I have one Bomani-related F.U.

45:56.960 --> 45:58.960
Because coming back from the Milpitas tournament,

45:58.960 --> 46:00.960
which we'll get to the coverage of in a little bit.

46:02.960 --> 46:07.960
Whoever built that merge where 680 and 80 meet,

46:07.960 --> 46:09.960
fuck you.

46:09.960 --> 46:14.960
Whoever designed it a two-lane freeway should have to merge three times

46:14.960 --> 46:18.960
to get back on the 80, causing traffic to back up for like five miles.

46:18.960 --> 46:21.960
Dude, you're a cunt, and I don't like you.

46:21.960 --> 46:24.960
Dude, you take the fucking exit that takes you by South Scandia

46:24.960 --> 46:26.960
to A if you want, you can stop there,

46:26.960 --> 46:28.960
but B, you can get back onto the highway and skip that whole-

46:28.960 --> 46:30.460
This is the problem, Tal.

46:30.460 --> 46:33.960
Everybody knows about that, so it's not much better.

46:33.960 --> 46:35.960
That is true.

46:35.960 --> 46:39.960
Anyway, so F whoever built that.

46:40.960 --> 46:43.960
Puppy! Why aren't you playing Animal Crossing?

46:43.960 --> 46:45.960
Oh, because you're coming to do the F-U's?

46:45.960 --> 46:47.960
Oh, you okay, Ryan?

46:47.960 --> 46:50.960
F Ryan for ruining my chair?

46:50.960 --> 46:59.840
I'm putting you back in the closet where you belong, Ryan.

46:59.840 --> 47:05.520
I have more FUs, I'm trying to think of them.

47:05.520 --> 47:10.120
F Tom Nook, because he was giving away crappy shit in the Animal Crossing raffle yesterday.

47:10.120 --> 47:13.680
F people who don't like Animal Crossing.

47:13.680 --> 47:15.680
Starting with Tao.

47:15.680 --> 47:19.680
Yeah, Rob, it's called Fuck. Stay with me.

47:19.680 --> 47:22.680
Fuck!

47:22.680 --> 47:24.680
Is that a promise, Jamie?

47:24.680 --> 47:30.680
Oh my god, that would make a great special episode about Auradon, wouldn't it?

47:30.680 --> 47:32.680
Uh, and then, um...

47:32.680 --> 47:35.680
F the fact that I still can't get a date. That sucks.

47:35.680 --> 47:37.680
Fuck that!

47:37.680 --> 47:39.680
Fuck that no one will fuck me!

47:39.680 --> 47:40.680
Fuck that!

47:40.680 --> 47:42.680
Alright, I'm done.

47:42.680 --> 47:45.680
Alright, Tal, you have so much to say, let's hear it.

47:45.680 --> 47:49.680
Actually, you know what? I don't really need to give an F you, because I can just hit and rant on my live journal.

47:49.680 --> 47:52.680
And like, people can like, not read it because I post so much.

47:52.680 --> 47:55.680
You know, F my fucking nature to talk so goddamn much.

47:55.680 --> 47:57.680
It gets so annoying to other people, doesn't it?

47:57.680 --> 47:58.680
Fuck.

47:58.680 --> 47:59.680
Fuck that shit, man.

47:59.680 --> 48:02.680
No, F the fucking Counter-Strike guy for fucking...

48:02.680 --> 48:03.680
Yeah.

48:03.680 --> 48:04.680
Fuck that shit, man.

48:04.680 --> 48:07.680
But yeah, you guys have all heard the Counter-Strike song, right?

48:07.680 --> 48:09.680
Where the dude is like, being liked by his buddy.

48:09.680 --> 48:10.680
Uh, we're gonna hear it later.

48:10.680 --> 48:20.920
greatest call ever but it's my cage man picture tonight actually what I'd like

48:20.920 --> 48:25.540
to have unlicensed drivers because like my mom was in an accident the other day

48:25.540 --> 48:29.640
because she was like rear-ended by some fucker without a license and because it's

48:29.640 --> 48:33.480
in a rental car we got even more shit and so f rental companies are being dicks

48:33.480 --> 48:37.600
and then like you know f logs in the road and like f random people who are

48:37.600 --> 48:41.600
I'm just hideous and like f-fucking the f-word and the f-letter.

48:41.600 --> 48:44.600
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck. I just made up the music.

48:44.600 --> 48:47.600
Yes. Fuck the f-letter in the opposite.

48:48.600 --> 48:50.600
Fuck the Daredevil movie for being gay.

48:52.600 --> 48:53.600
Oh my god.

48:53.600 --> 48:58.600
Fuck them for having a cracker-ass Elektra.

48:58.600 --> 49:00.600
hahahahahaha

49:00.600 --> 49:02.600
it's so...

49:02.600 --> 49:04.600
dude

49:04.600 --> 49:06.600
you know the only thing that would make that movie cool

49:06.600 --> 49:08.600
is if they had kept fighting

49:08.600 --> 49:12.600
cause kevin smith can take any piece of crap and make it cool

49:12.600 --> 49:16.600
like scary movie 3 which is happening by the way

49:16.600 --> 49:18.600
right

49:18.600 --> 49:20.600
oh they already did that

49:20.600 --> 49:22.600
didn't they do like

49:22.600 --> 49:24.600
oh, oh no

49:24.600 --> 49:27.600
It was, uh, Scream 3 that had Jay and Silent Bob in it.

49:28.600 --> 49:29.600
Who?

49:29.600 --> 49:32.600
As I said, Scream 3 had Jay and Silent Bob.

49:33.600 --> 49:35.600
Yes, they were in the background, getting in the line.

49:35.600 --> 49:36.600
I hate Jay and Silent Bob.

49:38.600 --> 49:41.600
Dude, fuck Jay and Silent Bob, man.

49:41.600 --> 49:43.600
They're the fucking worst parts of those damn movies.

49:43.600 --> 49:47.600
I mean, I like all the rest of them, but I really hate Jay and Silent Bob.

49:47.600 --> 49:50.600
They're such dicks, I hate them. I don't know how people can watch that shit.

49:50.600 --> 49:52.600
Not gonna do a shout.

49:52.600 --> 49:57.600
Actually, I'm going home anyway, so it was nice talking to you guys, um, about you, but

49:57.600 --> 49:59.600
I can't hear you either.

49:59.600 --> 50:01.600
Great, who's gonna talk now?

50:01.600 --> 50:04.600
Well, I'm sure you'll figure out some way to fill three hours.

50:04.600 --> 50:08.600
Bye, Tal. Thanks for coming. Happy birthday. Everybody sing to Tal.

50:08.600 --> 50:12.600
Happy birthday, fuck you.

50:12.600 --> 50:15.600
Happy birthday, fuck you.

50:15.600 --> 50:20.600
Happy birthday, fuck you, Tal.

50:20.600 --> 50:27.440
fuck you too. Happy birthday, fuck you. Alright, get out. Oh yes, and I do expect presents

50:27.440 --> 50:33.800
on my birthday, to say no. Bitch, you're getting all the shit for free. Alright. Here we go.

50:33.800 --> 50:38.520
Yes, the thought that counts. Moving along, uh, let's get to Black Lab, because I have

50:38.520 --> 50:42.440
this song queued up already, so, you have any, I'm sure, need I ask if Puppy has any

50:42.440 --> 50:49.440
F's of the week? Oh yes, you don't need to ask me. Let's see, first of all, a big, large,

50:49.440 --> 50:51.440
FUCK YOU!

51:19.440 --> 51:23.440
The wind thing. So many people do it against it, and that's not the way you do it.

51:23.440 --> 51:25.440
Cut more...

51:25.440 --> 51:27.440
Anyway, yeah, anyway, sorry.

51:27.440 --> 51:29.440
We don't want Puppy to kill himself.

51:31.440 --> 51:33.440
Let's see, um...

51:33.440 --> 51:35.440
Actually, I was trying to craft something.

51:37.440 --> 51:39.440
Fuck sudden hailstorms, because I was...

51:39.440 --> 51:41.440
Yesterday...

51:41.440 --> 51:43.440
Loki, shut up, I'm trying to talk.

51:43.440 --> 51:45.440
Would you... You can't...

51:45.440 --> 51:47.440
Yeah, you're distracting me.

51:49.440 --> 51:51.440
Wait, I'm still trying to continue doing this.

51:51.440 --> 51:53.440
We don't want to talk about suicide!

51:55.440 --> 51:57.440
Go kill yourselves and I'll take over this show.

52:02.440 --> 52:04.440
Uh, no thank you.

52:08.440 --> 52:10.440
I can run.

52:11.440 --> 52:13.440
It will be much closer to you.

52:13.440 --> 52:20.440
I'm going to kick you.

52:20.440 --> 52:23.440
Down, boy.

52:23.440 --> 52:26.440
Look at my ass, no.

52:26.440 --> 52:29.440
No, not my ass.

52:29.440 --> 52:31.440
Okay, I have bug cat.

52:31.440 --> 52:37.440
No, don't get it.

52:37.440 --> 52:39.440
Get puppy.

52:39.440 --> 52:41.440
Bug cat here.

52:41.440 --> 52:57.440
Okay, um, as I was saying earlier, fuck sudden hailstorms because I was riding home from Del Taco on my bike, and as I was going over the overpass, over 80, on my bike, it starts to fucking hail, like probably nickel-sized hailstones.

52:58.440 --> 53:03.440
Just kidding, I fucking hurt! I had to bail underneath a gas station.

53:03.440 --> 53:05.440
That was like why you called Mike Tyson's assistant.

53:05.440 --> 53:06.440
What?

53:06.440 --> 53:09.440
Is that why you didn't speak to him? Oh, that's why you called him.

53:09.440 --> 53:11.440
I know how

53:11.440 --> 53:13.440
just talking about

53:13.440 --> 53:15.440
her

53:15.440 --> 53:17.440
I have absolutely no clue what she was talking about

53:17.440 --> 53:19.440
um

53:19.440 --> 53:21.440
you're a dork

53:21.440 --> 53:23.440
you're an animator

53:23.440 --> 53:25.440
I'm a nerd

53:25.440 --> 53:27.440
yeah

53:27.440 --> 53:29.440
um

53:29.440 --> 53:31.440
yeah I'm done

53:31.440 --> 53:33.440
fuck not having more episodes

53:33.440 --> 53:35.440
I'm an angsty

53:35.440 --> 53:40.560
Alright, I just got a couple quick ones.

53:40.560 --> 53:44.120
Number one, fuck you to my DVD player for not letting me play vulgar.

53:44.120 --> 53:49.600
I have been waiting forever to get a hold of that DVD if my DVD player is dying.

53:49.600 --> 53:53.600
Another one, fuck you to evil once again who can't drive.

53:53.600 --> 53:57.640
I'm on my way walking here and a guy can't wait long enough to cross the road so he doesn't

53:57.640 --> 53:59.640
get my inches for trying to kill me.

53:59.640 --> 54:01.640
Because, you know, he's going there.

54:01.640 --> 54:03.640
He's some little ghetto boy or whatever.

54:03.640 --> 54:10.640
And another one, lucky to all the jocks who have to make fun of everybody who plays DDR, I'm really getting sick and tired of it.

54:10.640 --> 54:23.640
Yes, the other day I was over in Tandywood with DDR and some nice, good, good football player guys got on there and threw me straight off the pad just to make fun of them.

54:23.640 --> 54:25.640
That's when you kick them in the balls.

54:25.640 --> 54:28.640
I can't run that fast.

54:28.640 --> 54:30.640
They will attack you. They will attack you.

54:30.640 --> 54:31.640
That's the deal.

54:33.640 --> 54:34.640
He brought me balls.

54:35.640 --> 54:36.640
That's all I got, so.

54:36.640 --> 54:41.640
No, what you do is stand here and you freaking tell them what happened and they will throw their ass out.

54:41.640 --> 54:42.640
Alright, Jonas.

54:42.640 --> 54:43.640
It's stand here, they will.

54:43.640 --> 54:47.640
Jonas just got here, so we're gonna go ahead and let him do FUs, cause he brought balls.

54:47.640 --> 54:50.640
Jonas, you gotta keep it quick this week.

54:50.640 --> 54:51.640
I've never had balls.

54:51.640 --> 54:54.640
Let's just say, sorry for anybody who wants to hear any more FUs.

54:54.640 --> 54:55.640
I don't have any today.

54:55.640 --> 54:56.640
What?

54:56.640 --> 55:03.640
What? You mean you're in a good mood? What's this about?

55:04.200 --> 55:05.520
Thank you for the balls. We appreciate it.

55:05.520 --> 55:08.520
F you to stupid people, I believe. Three out of four babies should be thrown into a woodchipper.

55:08.520 --> 55:09.880
Alright.

55:09.880 --> 55:12.040
Oh, shit. Here we go.

55:12.040 --> 55:14.520
Well, since I missed the deadline,

55:14.520 --> 55:16.920
fuck school for costing me two.

55:16.920 --> 55:23.920
Get the whole bunch of delay.

55:23.920 --> 55:25.920
Yeah

55:27.200 --> 55:30.300
Don't all right chat room at use time here we go

55:30.300 --> 55:36.000
I'm gonna run through these really fast because I've seen there's more chat room at use tonight than I've ever seen before

55:36.000 --> 55:38.500
So we got to run through these. All right kids. Here we go

55:39.160 --> 55:43.920
Starting off stuff. Oh my god, I continued a few to his ex

55:44.280 --> 55:48.880
Maybe she find nothing but sorrow and pain in the arms of others. Yes, my own personal curse there next

55:48.880 --> 55:53.200
I want to send an F you to Megan you little fucking bitch die already also like to further the F you with an F

55:53.200 --> 55:56.200
F you to myself, fuck me for being so hung up on my ex. Save me, somebody.

55:56.200 --> 55:59.200
Sucks balls because I think it might have been going to hell.

55:59.200 --> 56:00.200
Alright.

56:02.200 --> 56:05.200
F you to politicians as a whole. Gray Davis especially deserves to die.

56:05.200 --> 56:11.200
Secondly, government headquarters in Sac sucks ass, they make things so hard for me to get my job with sudden rule fucking changes.

56:11.200 --> 56:15.200
I also wanted to send F you to everyone that thinks what happened yesterday was terrorism.

56:15.200 --> 56:17.200
The shuttle was under huge security before and during launch.

56:17.200 --> 56:30.400
So, F that. Okay. 23rd Magus says, F you to gangsta rap fans with no taste in music. I

56:30.400 --> 56:35.280
played maybe two tack songs the whole time. Let's review the rules the crowd used. One,

56:35.280 --> 56:39.240
if you play anything with a guitar in it anywhere in the song, you get mobbed by gangsta rap fans.

56:39.240 --> 56:44.000
Two, if you play anything with a synthesizer in it anywhere in the song, you get mobbed by gangsta

56:44.000 --> 56:49.000
Three, if you play anything without lyrics, you get mobbed by gangster rap fans.

56:49.000 --> 56:50.000
Oh, but it gets a lot better.

56:50.000 --> 56:55.000
Four, if you play anything done by a white guy, you get mobbed by gangster rap fans.

56:55.000 --> 57:01.000
If you play old-school rap, MC Hammerster Mix-A-Lot, you know when rap was good, you get mobbed by gangster rap fans.

57:01.000 --> 57:07.000
Seven, if you play anything without a drum track, everyone mobs you.

57:07.000 --> 57:10.000
Anyway, moving right along.

57:10.000 --> 57:12.000
Dark Tetsuya says, fuck being single.

57:12.000 --> 57:13.000
Amen.

57:14.000 --> 57:23.000
DCB says, fuck you to EX's Random for making me freestyle his secret rendezvous during the Milpitas tournament.

57:25.000 --> 57:29.000
And uh, fuck you to Loki for making fun of Keith from American Idol says DCB.

57:32.000 --> 57:33.000
I'm sorry?

57:33.000 --> 57:36.000
What was the piece called? The DCP-21?

58:03.000 --> 58:08.600
named J.C., I believe. I don't know, I wasn't there, I was my newbie. We'll talk about movies

58:08.600 --> 58:13.680
in a bit. Let's finish up interviews. Moving right along, Yossfibi says, fuck you to NASA

58:13.680 --> 58:21.160
for ruining Saturn morning cartoons. Word. Here's the thing, I was like, oh, spacial

58:21.160 --> 58:27.440
crash, okay, SNL. Fuck IRC.Acheheads.org for not letting me reconnect. Fuck his backhoe

58:27.440 --> 58:29.960
that drives the wrong way in parking lots with angle parking.

58:29.960 --> 58:32.960
That's why I woke up at, like, 1.30 in the afternoon.

58:32.960 --> 58:36.960
Look at my Yahoo go, oh fuck, my live channel's gonna be going to shit.

58:36.960 --> 58:42.960
Moomahimer says, fuck my idiot friends, you cannot keep his damn mouth shut about every little thing anymore.

58:42.960 --> 58:45.960
Tells him he should go die. Fuck Smarties for being so addicting.

58:45.960 --> 58:48.960
Smarties? Smarties are the shit. The blue ones, especially?

58:48.960 --> 58:51.960
They make you bark, Jamie?

58:51.960 --> 58:55.960
Whatever.

58:55.960 --> 59:01.960
Fuck Bomberman Online for not only being addicting, but completely in Japanese, which makes playing adventures ten times scarier.

59:01.960 --> 59:11.960
Fuck this dude at my school's basketball game who tried to beat up two of my teachers. He definitely should die and yay for GCHS. I second that being single. Fuck you.

59:11.960 --> 59:19.960
SkylineDC505 says fuck you to Nickel City for not having any other floors open. Hey man, that's Nickel City and Sacramento, by the way.

59:19.960 --> 59:28.960
SnubDysphonoid says fuck you to the sick fuck who made the extreme dropout edit for making it way too fucking hard. Is that you looking?

59:28.960 --> 59:32.760
No, that you can blame the Fifth Mix databank for that one.

59:32.760 --> 59:35.400
Fifth Mix at a databank, fuck that.

59:35.400 --> 59:37.540
Fuck you to the people who stole my wallet.

59:37.540 --> 59:40.800
I don't know how badly you want a fucking burrito, but I hope that 40 bucks you stole

59:40.800 --> 59:42.220
from me buys your own misery.

59:42.220 --> 59:47.280
And fuck you to the college board for making the SOT-1 so fucking boring.

59:47.280 --> 59:48.280
Sorry.

59:48.280 --> 59:54.300
The RP Ohio Bamani says, fuck you to Frankie Bones' plane for being stranded in New York

59:54.300 --> 59:58.460
and making the show be rescheduled until February 24th.

59:58.460 --> 01:00:02.460
Arkadian42 says fuck you to my foot for starting to hurt like a bitch yesterday so much that

01:00:02.460 --> 01:00:04.660
I couldn't make it to Tal's party at Scandia today.

01:00:04.660 --> 01:00:07.980
It's okay because everybody got there like 3 hours late and there really wasn't a party.

01:00:07.980 --> 01:00:08.980
We're all here now.

01:00:08.980 --> 01:00:09.980
SoCalKicks!

01:00:09.980 --> 01:00:10.980
Hey!

01:00:10.980 --> 01:00:12.140
Oh my god, I thought he was dead.

01:00:12.140 --> 01:00:15.100
He's like alive and listening to the show, hooray.

01:00:15.100 --> 01:00:18.660
Fuck you to xDCCBots that take forever to send.

01:00:18.660 --> 01:00:20.940
F you to Weekends for being too short.

01:00:20.940 --> 01:00:24.180
F you to Owen for being a dick the entire week but made up for it in the weekend.

01:00:24.180 --> 01:00:25.180
What do you do?

01:00:25.180 --> 01:00:26.180
Give you head.

01:00:26.180 --> 01:00:27.180
And F you of being broke.

01:00:27.180 --> 01:00:29.860
MC2, Windwalker, and other games, but I have no money.

01:00:29.860 --> 01:00:31.900
Plus, I have to pay for driver's ed classes,

01:00:31.900 --> 01:00:33.620
and I have to pay for soccer fair share.

01:00:33.620 --> 01:00:35.740
320 bucks altogether.

01:00:35.740 --> 01:00:37.780
Bitpawa says, F you to the egg head server

01:00:37.780 --> 01:00:39.620
that just dropped me like 30 minutes ago,

01:00:39.620 --> 01:00:40.740
and MRC wouldn't tell me.

01:00:40.740 --> 01:00:42.580
And finally, I'd just like to wish everyone out there

01:00:42.580 --> 01:00:43.820

01:00:45.940 --> 01:00:48.940
DCB says, fuck you to the fuck you segment for being so long.

Let's check these real fast

01:00:50.180 --> 01:00:52.180
and make sure we aren't missing anything.

01:00:52.180 --> 01:01:01.680
Um, you know, um, what you just pointed out was really cool.

01:01:01.680 --> 01:01:05.680
False bottles should be used in porn.

01:01:05.680 --> 01:01:06.680
Alright.

01:01:06.680 --> 01:01:08.680
I think you said ribs for her pleasure.

01:01:08.680 --> 01:01:09.680
Alright.

And your comments on this.

That brings an end to the FUs of the Week segment, so how you doing, Jonas?

01:01:14.680 --> 01:01:15.680

Anything you want to say tonight?

01:01:19.680 --> 01:01:24.960
Well, I was supposed to bring Bombay here today, but I'm not so sure where he was yet.

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:28.040
I try look over for Scandy, but he wasn't there.

01:01:28.040 --> 01:01:29.080
He'll be here another show.

01:01:29.080 --> 01:01:31.500
He was pretty much supposed to be everywhere, all weekend.

01:01:31.500 --> 01:01:35.860
He was supposed to be at Scandy the other day, he was there for like a half-hour, and he was supposed to be there at 9, he left.

01:01:35.860 --> 01:01:40.120
He was... he's mostly out with Shane or something, and now I don't know where he is.

01:01:40.120 --> 01:01:44.100
He was supposed to go home today, but he didn't, because he lives in my house and stuff, but.

01:01:44.100 --> 01:01:47.000
He just like... he never showed up, so I don't know what he's doing right now.

01:03:27.920 --> 01:03:30.920
Far away on the other side

01:03:30.920 --> 01:03:33.920
She was gone in the middle of the distance

01:03:33.920 --> 01:03:37.920
But she couldn't find how to push through

01:03:37.920 --> 01:03:40.920
She fell asleep in the evening

01:03:40.920 --> 01:03:44.920
Carried away by a moonlight shadow

01:03:44.920 --> 01:03:47.920
She sang her song when grieving

01:03:47.920 --> 01:03:51.920
Carried away by a moonlight shadow

01:03:51.920 --> 01:03:54.920
She saw what was feeling when it could come

01:03:54.920 --> 01:03:57.920
Far away on the other side

01:03:57.920 --> 01:04:01.920
He was shot six times by a man on her arm

01:04:01.920 --> 01:04:04.920
And she couldn't find how to push through

01:04:04.920 --> 01:04:08.920
I said, I said, I prayed

01:04:08.920 --> 01:04:11.920
I'd be in heaven one day

01:04:11.920 --> 01:04:15.920
Falling in the morning

01:04:15.920 --> 01:04:18.920
Carried away by a moonlight shed

01:04:18.920 --> 01:04:21.920
I watched your vision burning

01:04:21.920 --> 01:04:24.920
Carried away by the moonlight

01:04:24.920 --> 01:04:29.920
Shat, shat, shat, shat, shat, shat.

01:04:29.920 --> 01:04:30.420
Hey!

01:06:00.420 --> 01:06:13.420
Came in from the rain, it surged down on the avenue

01:06:13.420 --> 01:06:20.420
Thought I heard you talking so soon

01:06:20.420 --> 01:06:27.420
I turned on the lights, the TV and the radio

01:06:27.420 --> 01:06:32.420
Still I can't escape the dose of you

01:06:34.420 --> 01:06:37.420
What has happened to it all?

01:06:37.420 --> 01:06:40.420
Crazy some say

01:06:41.420 --> 01:06:46.420
Where is the life that I recognize?

01:06:47.420 --> 01:06:48.420
Don't go ahead

01:06:48.420 --> 01:06:52.420
But I won't cry for yesterday

01:06:52.420 --> 01:07:01.420
There's an ordinary world, somehow I have to find

01:07:02.420 --> 01:07:09.420
And as I try to make my way to the ordinary world

01:07:09.420 --> 01:07:15.420
I will learn to survive

01:07:29.420 --> 01:07:35.420
Please listen to Orange Lounge Radio, because real radio makes Captain Jack cry

01:07:35.420 --> 01:07:43.380
Hey, we're not back just yet. We're going to play one more song. It was by request,

01:07:43.380 --> 01:07:46.780
something from the Dance Media album. This is from Dance Media 20. It's Fei Wang, my

01:07:46.780 --> 01:07:50.380
Nour. She did Eyes On Me, but she also did this song. This is a great song from Dance

01:07:50.380 --> 01:07:57.380
2020 is Separate Ways here on Orange Mountain Radio.

01:08:20.380 --> 01:08:21.380
My heart is rolling tonight

01:08:21.380 --> 01:08:22.380
Fly away, up and away

01:08:22.380 --> 01:08:23.380
I need, I know

01:08:23.380 --> 01:08:24.380
This time she's all gone

01:08:24.380 --> 01:08:25.380
She left from my way

01:08:25.380 --> 01:08:26.380
Ooh

01:08:26.380 --> 01:08:27.380
I'm not funny, I'm hidden

01:08:27.380 --> 01:08:28.380
She's not really shiny at all

01:08:28.380 --> 01:08:29.380
Ooh

01:08:29.380 --> 01:08:30.380
Ooh

01:08:30.380 --> 01:08:31.380
Ooh

01:08:31.380 --> 01:08:32.380
Ooh

01:08:32.380 --> 01:08:33.380
Ooh

01:08:33.380 --> 01:08:34.380
Ooh

01:08:34.380 --> 01:08:35.380
Ooh

01:08:35.380 --> 01:08:36.380
Ooh

01:08:36.380 --> 01:08:37.380
Ooh

01:08:37.380 --> 01:08:38.380
Ooh

01:08:38.380 --> 01:08:39.380
Ooh

01:08:39.380 --> 01:08:40.380
Ooh

01:08:40.380 --> 01:08:41.380
Ooh

01:08:41.380 --> 01:08:42.380
Ooh

01:09:12.380 --> 01:09:14.380
What's in your eyes?

01:09:14.380 --> 01:09:16.880
If only no one would know

01:09:16.880 --> 01:09:20.380
I would be the one who would love myself

01:09:20.380 --> 01:09:22.380
Oh my god

01:09:22.380 --> 01:09:25.380
Run away, open way

01:09:25.380 --> 01:09:29.380
I'm not afraid of the light

01:09:29.380 --> 01:09:32.380
I need, I know

01:09:32.380 --> 01:09:35.380
I'm not afraid of the light

01:09:35.380 --> 01:09:38.380
I'm not afraid of the light

01:09:38.380 --> 01:09:41.380
I'm not afraid of the light

01:09:41.380 --> 01:09:44.880
Fly away, or no way

01:09:44.880 --> 01:09:48.380
You're not in a lane, I can't take you away, baby

01:09:48.380 --> 01:09:51.880
I, I know

01:09:51.880 --> 01:09:54.880
That there's nothing I can do

01:09:54.880 --> 01:09:57.880
So I'm going to take you away

01:09:57.880 --> 01:10:00.880
I'm going to take you on my way now

01:10:00.880 --> 01:10:16.160

back and uh... if you were asking what that song was that was separate ways by

01:10:33.120 --> 01:10:36.840
fay wong from decimator 20. Brad's back in the house. No that wasn't, that was the sesame

01:10:36.840 --> 01:10:39.800
street song.

01:10:39.800 --> 01:10:43.160
This is brad being oblivious, did you guys do the interview yet?

01:10:43.160 --> 01:10:44.720
Balls!

01:10:44.720 --> 01:10:47.720
Thank you for bringing it up we're gonna start those interviews right now i'm so

01:10:47.720 --> 01:10:49.480
glad you asked brad

01:10:49.480 --> 01:10:55.760
as you may or may not know on friday i took an adventure over till. Would you like to feel my balls?

01:10:55.760 --> 01:10:58.760
Oh, you strokin' Jamie's balls live on air?

01:10:58.760 --> 01:11:02.760
Can you explain the G-rated version of what balls really are?

01:11:02.760 --> 01:11:06.760
Because they may not sell balls everywhere, so I need to explain what balls is.

01:11:06.760 --> 01:11:09.760
Okay, I've been seeing people with this drink behind them that are moderately curious.

01:11:09.760 --> 01:11:11.760
Maybe I should have Jonas plug...

01:11:11.760 --> 01:11:12.760
Because he's the one that really is the master of balls.

01:11:12.760 --> 01:11:14.760
I used to work at GNC...

01:11:14.760 --> 01:11:18.760
A drink that has high caffeine and it's very good tasting.

01:11:18.760 --> 01:11:24.760
Guarana is what they put in all of those ones with the fetters, like in those little natural weight loss things.

01:11:24.760 --> 01:11:27.760
It's not necessarily caffeine, it's very like caffeine.

01:11:27.760 --> 01:11:30.760
Dead or Alive Volleyball, best game ever.

01:11:30.760 --> 01:11:35.760
Actually, no, it's the game that makes men act like girls.

01:11:35.760 --> 01:11:36.760
And I explain this way.

01:11:36.760 --> 01:11:42.760
Because they have to go shopping and buy accessories and know what their favorite colors are and their favorite foods.

01:11:42.760 --> 01:11:45.760
And then they give presents to other girls.

01:11:45.760 --> 01:11:47.760
Borderline dating sim.

01:11:47.760 --> 01:11:49.760
It's a dating sim for lesbians.

01:11:49.760 --> 01:11:51.760
Sweet.

01:11:51.760 --> 01:11:53.760
It makes men act like lesbians.

01:11:54.760 --> 01:11:55.760
DOA Volleyball.

01:11:56.760 --> 01:12:04.760
If you like DOA, Extreme Beach Volleyball, try the upcoming game that's probably going to come out this year for the Xbox. I think it's called N.U.D.E. Act.

01:12:05.760 --> 01:12:08.760
I have that BMX Triple X game. They sent it to us for free.

01:12:09.760 --> 01:12:10.760
How's that game anyways?

01:12:11.760 --> 01:12:17.760
Actually, as the game, it's not that bad, but it's not the best either.

01:12:17.760 --> 01:12:28.760
Yeah, because Dan manages GameStop, we get all kinds of neat free video games and all kinds of cool swag.

01:12:28.760 --> 01:12:34.760
Like, you know, I don't know if you saw my keychain, I have a GameCube keychain and a GBA keychain.

01:12:34.760 --> 01:12:40.760
Lovely, Brad, lovely. In case people missed it, Brad belched. Anyway.

01:12:40.760 --> 01:12:43.760
Alright, are you guys ready to get to your rooms?

01:12:43.760 --> 01:12:44.760
No.

01:12:44.760 --> 01:12:45.760
Okay, Jamie.

01:12:45.760 --> 01:12:50.760
But we get free games every so often, and we get, like, um, porn games, so okay.

01:12:53.760 --> 01:12:54.760
Alright, you guys ready?

01:12:54.760 --> 01:12:55.760
Yes!

01:12:55.760 --> 01:12:59.760
Alright, here we go, we're gonna do the, uh, Milpitas Golf Land interviews. Enjoy!

01:12:59.760 --> 01:13:00.760
Yay!

01:13:00.760 --> 01:13:26.920
I don't know what happened at the beginning of that interview.

01:13:26.920 --> 01:13:27.920
That's weird.

01:13:27.920 --> 01:13:31.360
in the middle there. But we're talking to Melody, also known as SharksGirl, about Derby

01:13:31.360 --> 01:13:34.760
Owners Club. That's kind of weird. She's explaining what Derby Owners Club's all about. Sorry

01:13:34.760 --> 01:13:35.760
about that.

01:13:35.760 --> 01:13:38.320
You say, I want to do it again. And if you lose, you say, I have to do it again, because

01:13:38.320 --> 01:13:41.320
I have to win. And suddenly, you're down a hundred bucks.

01:13:41.320 --> 01:13:44.400
I won a race earlier, and I nearly wet my pants. I was so excited.

01:13:44.400 --> 01:13:46.600
Yeah, and you beat me.

01:13:46.600 --> 01:13:52.520
I'm sorry, but I beat my horse more than I beat you, if that's any consolation.

01:13:52.520 --> 01:13:53.520
Well, I...

01:13:53.520 --> 01:13:54.520
Leave the beating to somebody else.

01:13:54.520 --> 01:13:59.200
I guess I'll forgive you for that and I'm just going to leave that comment right alone.

01:13:59.200 --> 01:14:00.200
You're so kind.

01:14:00.200 --> 01:14:02.520
Oh, isn't there some DDR thing going on here today, too?

01:14:02.520 --> 01:14:03.520
A DDR tournament?

01:14:03.520 --> 01:14:04.520
What's that?

01:14:04.520 --> 01:14:07.320
Oh, yeah, there's a DDR tournament going on in the other room.

01:14:07.320 --> 01:14:11.240
Is that why you're here tonight or are you going to be participating in anything or are

01:14:11.240 --> 01:14:12.800
you just here to cheer people on?

01:14:12.800 --> 01:14:14.280
I'm just kind of here to watch.

01:14:14.280 --> 01:14:19.160
This time I'm not doing anything, not going to do that for a little while, but yeah, I

01:14:19.160 --> 01:14:22.440
just kind of wanted to see what's going on and catch more extreme because I still haven't

01:14:22.440 --> 01:14:24.000
heard many of the songs on it.

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:27.000
I think that's pretty much me too. You know, if you listen to Orange Lounge from

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:31.000
Lonnie Music and More, I'm gonna hear lots of stuff from Extreme. Wink, wink, nudge, nudge, plug.

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:36.000
Well, you know, I kind of have this little thing called a life that really keeps me going.

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:38.000
Hey, hey! I don't like where you're going with that, missy.

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:42.000
Okay, well how about this? I have a really slow freaking connection.

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:47.000
Okay, fair enough. Fine, be that way. Fine, we understand.

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:50.000
I don't want to talk to you no more. Let's talk to this person sitting across the table. Say hello.

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:51.000
Hi.

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:52.000
What's your name?

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:53.000
Uh, Ron.

01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:55.000
And do you have an online name that you buy?

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:57.000
Uke Bondage Boy.

01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:59.000
Right on. What brings you to today's lovely tournament?

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:02.000
Being cheerleader for Myaniki.

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:04.000
Right on. So you're not going to be participating?

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:07.000
Are you going to get up there and actually cheerlead while there's a routine going on?

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:09.000
No.

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:11.000
Do you think Para Para is anything like cheerleading?

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:13.000
Somewhat, yeah.

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:15.000
Do you own any boots?

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:17.000
Boots?

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:19.000
Yeah, you don't like Para Para boots? The big silver boots that come up to your knees?

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:22.000
No, I have big black boots with lots of buckles.

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:28.200
That's where you go hence the name bondage. Yep. Why do you go by bondage boy? There's just you like

01:15:29.080 --> 01:15:33.000
It was actually a joke because most people when I talk to them online

01:15:33.040 --> 01:15:38.520
I don't tell them that I'm female right away because a lot of yaoi fans are female and

01:15:39.080 --> 01:15:44.440
They're all into the whole female female relationship. So I don't need any extra baggage like that

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:49.520
So you're into the yaoi? Yeah. Oh, yes. So is the lovely Jamie who couldn't be here tonight?

01:15:49.520 --> 01:15:54.760
I'm sure I'm sure you two could talk about yaoi all night long. We often do right on. Yes. Yes

01:15:55.280 --> 01:15:59.640
What's your favorite yaoi? Um, I don't have a favorite right now

01:15:59.640 --> 01:16:04.000
I'm like really into xeno gears because I just started playing it and initial D

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:10.380
Initial D. What if they did like initial D yaoi that's like kind of role-playing would that be like the shit?

01:16:10.380 --> 01:16:16.960
Oh, I already kind of do that. Oh right on cool. Well anything else you want to say to lovely listeners of orange launch radio?

01:16:16.960 --> 01:16:22.960
Have fun listening. I can't listen. My computer doesn't like streaming.

01:16:22.960 --> 01:16:25.960
That's okay. We forgive you. But thanks for being on the show.

01:16:25.960 --> 01:16:26.960
Not a problem.

01:16:26.960 --> 01:16:32.960
Cool. Also joining us, we're joined by a few good men here at the table. Say hello everybody.

01:16:32.960 --> 01:16:37.960
I hope he doesn't mind me shoving the microphone in his face. It's Mr. Wendell.

01:16:37.960 --> 01:16:41.960
You just say that so erotically.

01:16:41.960 --> 01:16:47.960
I was coming off a yaoi high. What can I say? I said coming.

01:16:47.960 --> 01:16:52.360
Oh, you make my nipples so hard now.

01:16:52.360 --> 01:16:55.080
So are you going to be participating in today's tournament?

01:16:55.080 --> 01:16:57.600
I will participate,

01:16:57.600 --> 01:17:02.080
albeit not necessarily be all that great, but hey, hey, that worked.

01:17:02.080 --> 01:17:06.120
Yeah, I'll either improv freestyle just for the heck of it, you know.

01:17:06.120 --> 01:17:09.720
And I'm sure it'll be fun. Now how do you approach improv freestyle as opposed to

01:17:09.720 --> 01:17:13.000
routine freestyle, with the obvious exception of you don't really plan in advance. Do you

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:15.920
go in a different mindset when you get up there?

01:17:15.920 --> 01:17:21.120
You never really know what song you're going to get. You just got to go with what you got,

01:17:21.120 --> 01:17:22.120
try to do what you can.

01:17:22.120 --> 01:17:25.200
Everybody says he gets baby, baby loves me.

01:17:25.200 --> 01:17:28.280
Let's hear that comment for the listeners.

01:17:28.280 --> 01:17:30.040
I fucking forgot, so.

01:17:30.040 --> 01:17:31.040
And who are you good, sir?

01:17:31.040 --> 01:17:33.040
I want that one, Bobby!

01:17:33.040 --> 01:17:37.400
Shut up, dude. That's a hella cool name. Fuzzy Hat. Hello, Fuzzy Hat. What brings you to

01:17:37.400 --> 01:17:38.400
today's tournament?

01:17:38.400 --> 01:17:43.400
It's either this or go to Dave & Buster's.

01:17:43.400 --> 01:17:47.400
Oh, you're here for Derby Owners Club too then?

01:17:47.400 --> 01:17:50.400
No, I get Derby Owners Club for free at Dave & Buster's.

01:17:50.400 --> 01:17:52.400
Oh, I see.

01:17:52.400 --> 01:17:57.400
Are you going to be participating in improv too?

01:17:57.400 --> 01:17:58.400
Yeah.

01:17:58.400 --> 01:18:01.400
Well now what happens if you get Baby Baby Love Me?

01:18:01.400 --> 01:18:04.400
It'll be hella awesome.

01:18:04.400 --> 01:18:06.400
Will it be erotic and sensuous?

01:18:06.400 --> 01:18:08.400
No, it'll just be hella awesome.

01:18:08.400 --> 01:18:10.400
Sounds good.

01:18:10.400 --> 01:18:14.400
Well, good luck to you both.

01:18:14.400 --> 01:18:15.400
Good luck.

01:18:15.400 --> 01:18:19.400
Also, over here, let's say hello to an old favorite of the show as well.

01:18:19.400 --> 01:18:22.400
Say hello to Moby.

01:18:22.400 --> 01:18:24.400
Howdy.

01:18:24.400 --> 01:18:26.400
And what brings you to today's tournament?

01:18:26.400 --> 01:18:28.400
Um, intrigue.

01:18:28.400 --> 01:18:34.400
It's just kind of interesting to see, after all the ranting and raving there's been going on between preparedness and improv routines,

01:18:34.400 --> 01:18:39.400
There's a competition catered to the improv kind.

01:18:39.400 --> 01:18:42.400
So do you think something like this was needed for the community?

01:18:42.400 --> 01:18:50.400
I think improv is, you know, it's just as important to freestyle as it is, as prepared routines are.

01:18:50.400 --> 01:18:53.400
There are some people who prefer the former over the latter.

01:18:53.400 --> 01:18:57.400
There are some who think that, you know, someone who has a raw talent should be able to win every turn in.

01:18:57.400 --> 01:19:02.400
This is one for just, one for argument's sake if nothing else.

01:19:02.400 --> 01:19:04.400
So you're not going to be participating, though?

01:19:04.400 --> 01:19:10.400
Oh, I would, but it's like, I've got to save my goods up for the CBN coming up in a couple weeks,

01:19:10.400 --> 01:19:16.400
and it's like, if I blow my wad now, I'll be shooting blanks at CBN, and then, you know, what happens there?

01:19:16.400 --> 01:19:18.400
Heaven forbid, Mel Blanc.

01:19:18.400 --> 01:19:21.400
Yeah, that's what the beat will stand for.

01:19:21.400 --> 01:19:23.400
Gee.

01:19:23.400 --> 01:19:26.400
That's all, folks!

01:19:26.400 --> 01:19:28.400
On that note, I think this interview is going to come to a close,

01:19:28.400 --> 01:19:31.680
But do you guys have any final thoughts, anything you guys want to say to listeners, Orange

01:19:31.680 --> 01:19:32.680
Arms?

01:19:32.680 --> 01:19:39.400
Yeah, go out there, have some fun, and where's the beer?

01:19:39.400 --> 01:19:40.400
Where is the beer?

01:19:40.400 --> 01:19:41.800
That's a very good question.

01:19:41.800 --> 01:19:47.720
Jamie's, the lovely Dark Sacra, who couldn't be here tonight, unfortunately, is going to

01:19:47.720 --> 01:19:50.080
be getting drunk on the show, I believe, the next week's show.

01:19:50.080 --> 01:19:52.680
I'm away at Cyber Beat Nation, she's going to help me get drunk.

01:19:52.680 --> 01:19:59.680
I love you, Dr. Gura! You should have been here!

01:19:59.680 --> 01:20:01.680
Wait, Jamie wanted to interrupt and say something.

01:20:01.680 --> 01:20:06.680
Um, I will be getting drunk, and Shucksco will be getting drunk with me.

01:20:06.680 --> 01:20:07.680
Word.

01:20:07.680 --> 01:20:12.680
And our static problem got worse, God damn it, our static problem.

01:20:12.680 --> 01:20:21.680
I won't be getting drunk, I don't think, because I don't drink, and I'm kind of afraid to drink because since I'd be such a lightweight, you know, getting sick and then possibly violent, you know, who knows?

01:20:21.680 --> 01:20:22.680
Who knows?

01:20:22.680 --> 01:20:24.680
You're going to be around two drunk women.

01:20:24.680 --> 01:20:25.680
Yes.

01:20:25.680 --> 01:20:27.680
We're going to be laughing our asses off.

01:20:27.680 --> 01:20:30.680
Too bad there's no attraction or anything or you could be in the middle of a lesbian

01:20:30.680 --> 01:20:31.680
sandwich.

01:20:31.680 --> 01:20:32.680
No!

01:20:32.680 --> 01:20:34.680
Alright, back to the interviews.

01:20:34.680 --> 01:20:35.680
Hi.

01:20:35.680 --> 01:20:36.680
Hi.

01:20:36.680 --> 01:20:41.160
It's called work and it's evil.

01:20:41.160 --> 01:20:43.200
Any final thoughts from LB?

01:20:43.200 --> 01:20:47.660
RTF World Domination, give us your finest meats and cheeses.

01:20:47.660 --> 01:20:49.320
Any final words from Sharks Girl?

01:20:49.320 --> 01:20:50.680
Say no to Derby owner crack.

01:20:50.680 --> 01:20:53.880
And even though I already asked her anything from bondage boy, um

01:20:54.640 --> 01:20:57.420
Not really. I love your hair by the way. Thank you

01:20:59.160 --> 01:21:01.160
It's more felicious, yeah

01:21:01.960 --> 01:21:03.960
All right more interviews to come later

01:21:04.480 --> 01:21:10.560
And now and now joining us at the table the ever so lovely tonight's introduce yourself kind lady

01:21:10.800 --> 01:21:13.520
Hi, I'm Jenny bean. What's up, everyone?

01:21:13.520 --> 01:21:16.520
How are you doing tonight? What brings you to Milvitas tonight?

01:21:16.520 --> 01:21:18.520
The wonderful tournament that Milton's running.

01:21:18.520 --> 01:21:21.520
Right on. Are you going to be participating? Are you judging? Or what's going on?

01:21:21.520 --> 01:21:22.520
I'm judging.

01:21:22.520 --> 01:21:27.520
Ooh. Now, okay. I haven't talked to a judge yet. What are you going to be looking for in tonight's improv?

01:21:27.520 --> 01:21:36.520
Guys, I don't know. It's harder to judge improv, I think. But, um, I don't know. I'm just looking for a good flow of routines and all that. The normal stuff.

01:21:36.520 --> 01:21:41.520
Now, I know you can't play favorites. Was there any particular person you're looking forward to seeing do an improv routine?

01:21:41.520 --> 01:21:46.560
team? Not really. Actually, I guess Fuzzy Hat, because I like his improv routines. I

01:21:46.560 --> 01:21:50.200
think he's pretty good at it. He does some pretty good shit. We're hoping he gets Baby

01:21:50.200 --> 01:21:55.360
Baby Love Me. That would be cool! Anything else you want to say to the listeners of Orange

01:21:55.360 --> 01:21:59.360
Lawns Radio? And Dark Sakura and Loki, they're in the studio, couldn't be here tonight. Well,

01:21:59.360 --> 01:22:06.440
hello to all of them, and hello to everyone who's listening. Any words of wisdom for Bimani

01:22:06.440 --> 01:22:13.440
players out there, if any new people that want to start improv freestyling.

01:22:14.200 --> 01:22:19.200
Watch videos. Sounds good. All right, more interviews to come.

01:22:19.200 --> 01:22:26.200
All right, a little bit of time has passed and PA is over now and I had a second to step

01:22:26.360 --> 01:22:30.320
outside with this fine gentleman. Introduce yourself for all the orange on the scissors.

01:22:30.320 --> 01:22:33.920
I'm Milton, aka Maple, the tournament organizer of NorCal.

01:22:33.920 --> 01:22:35.920
So, what made you decide to do a tournament today?

01:22:36.920 --> 01:22:42.920
Extreme came out a month ago, and I promised Paul, as well as a lot of other people, that I'd throw a tournament one month after we got Extreme.

01:22:43.920 --> 01:22:44.920
So, a month later, tournament.

01:22:45.920 --> 01:22:46.920
How's it going? You guys happy with the turnout?

01:22:47.920 --> 01:22:52.920
Turnout, yes. We didn't think it would be this many people, but then people surprised us. Last minute people come, and you know.

01:22:53.920 --> 01:22:57.920
Right on. So what made you guys decide to do an improv freestyle, as opposed to the typical routine freestyle?

01:22:57.920 --> 01:23:00.920
Well, honestly, out of all my tournaments, I've never ran improv.

01:23:00.920 --> 01:23:02.920
It's always been routine freestyle.

01:23:02.920 --> 01:23:06.920
And a person, Jason, ran, or ran on the boards as you may know,

01:23:06.920 --> 01:23:10.920
he brought to my attention that, you know, there should be improv, just improv against routine.

01:23:10.920 --> 01:23:13.920
So I decided to throw improv freestyle at him.

01:23:13.920 --> 01:23:16.920
A lot of people entered, you know, people supported, some people didn't support it.

01:23:16.920 --> 01:23:19.920
And he said, I didn't want to have a routine freestyle with CBN coming up so soon.

01:23:19.920 --> 01:23:22.920
That's what a lot of people have been saying is that they're kind of glad that it didn't happen

01:23:22.920 --> 01:23:24.920
because they're saving their routines for Cyberbeat.

01:23:24.920 --> 01:23:25.920
So I'll be going.

01:23:25.920 --> 01:23:26.920
So you're going to be going to Cyberbeat?

01:23:26.920 --> 01:23:32.580
to beat? Of course. Alright, looking forward to that. So how many tournaments have you,

01:23:32.580 --> 01:23:36.240
in the past year, how many tournaments have you had a hand in running, do you think? In

01:23:36.240 --> 01:23:44.860
running or helping with? Both, if you can recall either. Everything from Fremont to

01:23:44.860 --> 01:23:53.180
now excluding Spigle 2? Everything. I'm pretty sure, in NorCal. That's a whole lot of tournaments.

01:23:53.180 --> 01:23:56.540
So wait, you haven't actually judged a tournament in a while though, that's kind of a break

01:23:56.540 --> 01:24:01.540
Well, I judged MGL Evil Tournament 2, which was December 13th.

01:24:01.540 --> 01:24:05.540
What kind of things do you think the judges will be looking for tonight in Improv Freestyle's poster routine freestyle?

01:24:05.540 --> 01:24:12.540
Well, for freestyle, this time I have seven judges, and they're each judging a category.

01:24:12.540 --> 01:24:16.540
One of them is judging on, for example, one of them is judging on energy, one of them is judging on power moves,

01:24:16.540 --> 01:24:20.540
the other one is judging on aero flexibility, which is how you use aeros.

01:24:20.540 --> 01:24:23.540
Any other upcoming events you want to let our listeners know about?

01:24:23.540 --> 01:24:32.540
Not really, the only thing I know about is CBN in February, and then March Madness in March, and then probably B3 in May, I think May 18th and 19th, I'm pretty sure, or the weekend around there.

01:24:32.540 --> 01:24:37.540
And then, as for summer, I don't know, and I think it's B3. Right, Corey?

01:24:37.540 --> 01:24:38.540
Supposedly B3.

01:24:38.540 --> 01:24:39.540
Supposedly B3, so why not?

01:24:39.540 --> 01:24:42.540
A question mark. You heard it here first, or second, or third.

01:24:43.540 --> 01:24:45.540
Anything else you want to say to listeners?

01:24:46.540 --> 01:24:47.540
Okay, yes, R2 has a question for Milton.

01:24:47.540 --> 01:24:51.540
What about the other 13 categories you mentioned to me earlier?

01:24:51.540 --> 01:24:53.540
What do you mean by that?

01:24:53.540 --> 01:24:55.540
You said you had 20?

01:24:55.540 --> 01:24:57.540
Yes, but I have to cut down.

01:24:57.540 --> 01:25:01.540
I don't want more judges than there are entries in the tournament.

01:25:01.540 --> 01:25:03.540
I understand.

01:25:03.540 --> 01:25:05.540
Dismissed?

01:25:05.540 --> 01:25:11.540
I want a freestyle tournament with 5 entries and having 87 judges.

01:25:11.540 --> 01:25:13.540
That'd be dope.

01:25:13.540 --> 01:25:15.540
That'd be dope.

01:25:15.540 --> 01:25:17.540
That's when all the judges would slam them on everything.

01:25:17.540 --> 01:25:19.540
Any final thoughts for the listeners?

01:25:19.540 --> 01:25:21.540
Not really.

01:25:21.540 --> 01:25:24.540
Alright, thank you for joining us today.

01:25:24.540 --> 01:25:25.540
No problem.

01:25:25.540 --> 01:25:26.540
Good luck with the rest of the tournament.

01:25:26.540 --> 01:25:27.540
Alright, thanks.

01:25:27.540 --> 01:25:28.540
I'm ready.

01:25:28.540 --> 01:25:29.540
Yeah.

01:25:29.540 --> 01:25:32.540
Okay, so we got another interview here. Introduce yourself for our listeners.

01:25:32.540 --> 01:25:33.540
Axel.

01:25:33.540 --> 01:25:34.540
Yeah. Hi guys.

01:25:34.540 --> 01:25:36.540
What's up? Where are you from?

01:25:36.540 --> 01:25:37.540
Stockton.

01:25:37.540 --> 01:25:40.540
What brings you to the Milpitas tournament this evening?

01:25:40.540 --> 01:25:43.540
To see my buddy, Milton, and John, virtue.

01:25:43.540 --> 01:25:44.540
Don't lie.

01:25:44.540 --> 01:25:47.540
The rest of the Killer Pals and Samantha.

01:25:47.540 --> 01:25:50.540
Are you participating in anything tonight? PA? Improv?

01:25:50.540 --> 01:25:51.540
Yeah, I did PA.

01:25:51.540 --> 01:25:52.540
How'd you do?

01:25:52.540 --> 01:25:54.540
Lost fresh ground at Tigger.

01:25:54.540 --> 01:25:55.540
Dope.

01:25:55.540 --> 01:25:56.540
Very dope.

01:25:56.540 --> 01:25:58.540
Okay, I'm off to him too.

01:25:58.540 --> 01:25:59.540
What was the song?

01:25:59.540 --> 01:26:01.540
Uh, what was it? It was uh...

01:26:01.540 --> 01:26:02.540
I didn't play him.

01:26:02.540 --> 01:26:03.540
Gentle Stress.

01:26:03.540 --> 01:26:04.540
Bummer.

01:26:04.540 --> 01:26:08.540
So um, what, so you're just, you're not going to be doing freestyle? You watching, or?

01:26:08.540 --> 01:26:09.540
I'm leaving.

01:26:09.540 --> 01:26:11.540
You're leaving?

01:26:11.540 --> 01:26:15.540
Is it hard to get to, you said you were having problems getting a ride over here, or?

01:26:15.540 --> 01:26:18.540
Yes, no one is willing to really take me.

01:26:18.540 --> 01:26:21.540
Tell us about the DDR scene in Stockton, because we don't talk to many people from there.

01:26:21.540 --> 01:26:28.540
We've talked about Stockton Golf Land on the show, because we refer to it as ghetto golf land, but...

01:26:28.540 --> 01:26:30.540
It is pretty ghetto.

01:26:30.540 --> 01:26:32.540
If you want to get shot, then that's the place to go.

01:26:32.540 --> 01:26:34.540
Have you ever seen anyone get killed at Golf Land?

01:26:34.540 --> 01:26:36.540
No, but I've witnessed a shooting.

01:26:36.540 --> 01:26:38.540
Have you ever wanted to kill somebody at Golf Land?

01:26:38.540 --> 01:26:39.540
Not me.

01:26:39.540 --> 01:26:41.540
Those little kids are fucking mean.

01:26:41.540 --> 01:26:47.540
Yeah, I know. Every day I want to kill them. They ask for tokens. I give them to them. They're intimidating.

01:26:47.540 --> 01:26:49.540
Anything else you want to say for our listeners this evening?

01:26:49.540 --> 01:26:51.540
Bye, guys.

01:26:51.540 --> 01:26:53.540
Says it all.

01:26:53.540 --> 01:26:58.540
All right, we are back with somebody who was on the show a couple weeks ago when we were at his tournament,

01:26:58.540 --> 01:27:01.540
but now he's here at the Milpitas tournament. Introduce yourselves for the listeners.

01:27:01.540 --> 01:27:03.540
Hi, guys. I'm DCB.

01:27:03.540 --> 01:27:06.540
Hi, DCB. What brings you to Milpitas today?

01:27:06.540 --> 01:27:09.540
One word. Shades.

01:27:09.540 --> 01:27:12.980
That's another interview I gotta get later, if I can.

01:27:12.980 --> 01:27:14.300
So, uh,

01:27:14.300 --> 01:27:17.780
what kind of stuff are you doing here today? Are you participating in PA, freestyling that?

01:27:17.780 --> 01:27:21.460
Uh, I was one of the three people that didn't qualify for PA.

01:27:21.460 --> 01:27:23.300
Dope. Yeah, I'm that elite.

01:27:23.300 --> 01:27:24.860
You're in a special club?

01:27:24.860 --> 01:27:27.500
Yeah, there's like three of us, so that's cool.

01:27:27.500 --> 01:27:28.980
Did you come in dead last?

01:27:28.980 --> 01:27:32.080
No, I don't know, last Milton.

01:27:32.080 --> 01:27:35.220
Well, that's something, at least you didn't come in last. Alright, if you did, hey,

01:27:35.220 --> 01:27:36.980
last place is something.

01:27:36.980 --> 01:27:39.060
So, I hear you got a joke for the listeners.

01:27:39.060 --> 01:27:50.100
Knock knock. Who's there? Who's there? Bob. Bob who? Bob Saget. Oh. Oh. Ha. Ha ha. I think

01:27:50.100 --> 01:27:53.440
if you were on Star Search they would have given you one star, but that's right. I'd

01:27:53.440 --> 01:27:57.920
rather be on American Idol because Simon is sexy. You want to audition for American Idol

01:27:57.920 --> 01:28:01.080
right now? You want to sing us something? Uh, no. Sing us something from DDR. Come on,

01:28:01.080 --> 01:28:08.000
cartoon heroes. We are the killer pals. Hi guys. Explain to us, I don't think we talked

01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:10.380
there's a Fremont tell us about the killer pals what's the concept behind

01:28:10.380 --> 01:28:14.940
killer pals and plug the website we really don't know it's just like all my

01:28:14.940 --> 01:28:19.080
friends and we call ourselves the killer pals do you kill people no we don't kill

01:28:19.080 --> 01:28:24.160
people we're actually nice kids and we get good grades in school and we drink

01:28:24.160 --> 01:28:30.000
our milk every night I was gonna say I noticed you change from Kirk Cameron to

01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:35.040
Bob Saget what what brought this on Kirk Cameron was just old like he didn't want

01:28:35.040 --> 01:28:41.680
be my friend anymore. But Bob Saget, he's fresh, yeah, he's cool. New ideas. Dirty Work's

01:28:41.680 --> 01:28:47.160
one of my favorite movies of all time. I like Full House. Hey, did you hear the Olsen twins

01:28:47.160 --> 01:28:52.720
going to college soon? I get it. That one's for you, for two. Who's your favorite Olsen

01:28:52.720 --> 01:29:01.400
twin? Yeah, anyway, anything else you want to say for our listeners? I just did the shittiest

01:29:01.400 --> 01:29:03.400
routine ever in the DDR tournament?

01:29:03.400 --> 01:29:05.400
Can you say shimmies?

01:29:05.400 --> 01:29:07.400
Yes, you can say anything you want on the fucking internet.

01:29:07.400 --> 01:29:14.400
Yeah, it sucked real bad. I didn't know what I was doing. I tried popping and locking all those cool kids, but I'm too white to do it.

01:29:14.400 --> 01:29:20.400
And then all the other killer pals got behind the machine and started making designs with their arms.

01:29:20.400 --> 01:29:22.400
And I don't know, I was just trying not to fail the stupid song.

01:29:22.400 --> 01:29:24.400
Were you leading everybody in the wave?

01:29:24.400 --> 01:29:25.400
I don't know what I was doing.

01:29:25.400 --> 01:29:26.400
What song did you get?

01:29:26.400 --> 01:29:28.400
Secret Rendezvous.

01:29:28.400 --> 01:29:30.400
Because you know we're secret lovers.

01:29:30.400 --> 01:29:33.120
or is that the cause of ideal about non-state

01:29:33.120 --> 01:29:36.040
between me and what's a

01:29:36.040 --> 01:29:39.240

to somebody who's been piping in

01:29:48.080 --> 01:29:50.960
because he always has something to say say hello was what the

01:29:50.960 --> 01:29:52.700
fourth or fifth time you don't show

01:29:52.700 --> 01:29:53.800

Oh my god, it's the Max 300 guy!

01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:06.000
Yeah, um...

01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:08.000
Max Unlimited, and Legend of Max.

01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:10.000
And DVR.

01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:12.000
DVR!

01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:14.000
And you were telling me about triple A's today?

01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:16.000
Yes, I have 20 heavy triple A's in two weeks.

01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:18.000
You're almost a Yasu level there.

01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:21.000
No, I'm scared of Yasu.

01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:23.000
What would you do if he showed up at Cyber Beat Ninja?

01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:25.000
I wouldn't enter.

01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:27.000
I'd never see you on.

01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:29.000
Bye guys!

01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:31.400
Oh, wait, say hello to our listeners. Who are you, young lady?

01:30:31.400 --> 01:30:32.600
Hi, I'm Samantha.

01:30:32.600 --> 01:30:36.200
Hi, Samantha. Anything you want to say? I have a fakuk shirt, too. It's one of my favorite clothing brands.

01:30:36.200 --> 01:30:37.000
He loves fakuk.

01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:38.600
Everybody loves to fakuk.

01:30:38.600 --> 01:30:39.800
I have an e-mail.

01:30:41.400 --> 01:30:42.600
Well, bye!

01:30:42.600 --> 01:30:43.800
Bye!

01:30:43.800 --> 01:30:45.400
Hey, thanks for your two.

01:30:45.400 --> 01:30:48.600
So, before I was so rudely interrupted...

01:30:48.600 --> 01:30:50.200
Calm down, buddy.

01:30:50.200 --> 01:30:56.200
Well, we were like, oh my god, a chick that plays DDR, so, you know, we had to break. News bulletin.

01:30:56.200 --> 01:30:57.400
News bulletin, yeah.

01:30:57.400 --> 01:30:58.600
Breaking news.

01:30:58.600 --> 01:31:03.100
Of course, we've got DarkSakura in the studio right now and no chick who plays DTR, but you know.

01:31:03.100 --> 01:31:04.800
So yes, um, do you have questions for me?

01:31:04.800 --> 01:31:08.700
Do I have questions for you? Yeah, what the hell are you doing here today? You doing Perkz Attack, you doing Freestyle?

01:31:08.700 --> 01:31:10.300
I'm losing to Tigger.

01:31:10.300 --> 01:31:12.400
As Perkz Attack's over, you lost to Tigger? Final round?

01:31:12.400 --> 01:31:13.200
Yeah.

01:31:13.200 --> 01:31:14.700
What was it? What'd you have to fight him on?

01:31:14.700 --> 01:31:17.200
What attack? Fucking Pollock.

01:31:17.200 --> 01:31:19.500
Piece of shit, motherfucking cocksuck.

01:31:19.500 --> 01:31:21.600
How bad did he beat you?

01:31:21.600 --> 01:31:22.600
93 Marvelous.

01:31:22.600 --> 01:31:23.600
Nope!

01:31:23.600 --> 01:31:26.400
That's my guys.

01:31:26.400 --> 01:31:28.400
So you're not going to be doing a freestyle today?

01:31:28.400 --> 01:31:30.400
I did my freestyle with the killer pals.

01:31:30.400 --> 01:31:31.400
I made a design.

01:31:31.400 --> 01:31:34.400
Oh, okay. What design were you a part of?

01:31:34.400 --> 01:31:36.400
I was the arm.

01:31:36.400 --> 01:31:38.400
An arm.

01:31:38.400 --> 01:31:40.400
Okay. So any other...

01:31:40.400 --> 01:31:43.400
You know that Buddha thing that has all the weird arms and like 50 legs?

01:31:43.400 --> 01:31:45.400
We made that behind the machine.

01:31:45.400 --> 01:31:48.400
And the machine was the body.

01:31:48.400 --> 01:31:49.400
Very interesting.

01:31:49.400 --> 01:31:52.400
I just had a picture of like all the FOBs in the crowd.

01:31:52.400 --> 01:31:55.400
Just like on their hands and knees worshipping Buddha.

01:31:55.400 --> 01:31:58.640
But they didn't realize it was a DDR machine.

01:31:58.640 --> 01:32:02.680
So it's now BBR, Buddha Buddha Revolution.

01:32:02.680 --> 01:32:04.440
Did you rub its belly?

01:32:04.440 --> 01:32:05.680
I fucked its belly.

01:32:05.680 --> 01:32:07.640
Side note, he's going to hell.

01:32:07.640 --> 01:32:08.600
Are you going to hell?

01:32:08.600 --> 01:32:09.360
I'm not Filipino.

01:32:09.360 --> 01:32:11.280
I mean, Viet like you.

01:32:11.280 --> 01:32:12.560
We're all going to hell for laughing.

01:32:12.560 --> 01:32:15.040
Bye, guys.

01:32:15.040 --> 01:32:18.080
Anything you want to plug?

01:32:18.080 --> 01:32:21.920
www.bmonniestyle.com as always

01:32:21.920 --> 01:32:24.360
the7.net for my web space

01:32:24.360 --> 01:32:27.520
which is almost gone

01:32:27.520 --> 01:32:28.480
killer pals

01:32:28.480 --> 01:32:32.160
I don't know the website because it's too damn long

01:32:32.160 --> 01:32:33.920
maple.org

01:32:33.920 --> 01:32:38.360
because he has the best blog in the world because he doesn't do anything on it

01:32:38.360 --> 01:32:40.440
koreanamerica.com

01:32:40.440 --> 01:32:41.600
soon to come

01:32:41.600 --> 01:32:44.820
because I triple A'd tears

01:32:44.820 --> 01:32:47.700
And B-Lovin' on my second try, which is also my first Nyan footer.

01:32:47.700 --> 01:32:49.300
Did you send those pictures to Aaron?

01:32:49.300 --> 01:32:54.060
Aaron wouldn't take my B-Lovin' because it wasn't the results screen fucking cock.

01:32:54.060 --> 01:32:55.940
The views and opinions expressed on Orange Line.

01:32:55.940 --> 01:33:02.200
He can address those cards and letters to Ver2, care of the Max 300 King's Pals.

01:33:02.200 --> 01:33:04.860
Yeah, my address is...

01:33:04.860 --> 01:33:06.780
Sunnyvale Golf Land.

01:33:06.780 --> 01:33:10.940
1984, El Camino Real, Golf Land, 94068.

01:33:10.940 --> 01:33:14.040
How much time would you say you spend at Sunnyvale Golf Land a week?

01:33:14.040 --> 01:33:28.040
Since Extreme came out, I've been there every day practicing for Saturday Beat Nation because I want the fucking controller, and I need $400 so I can go to Magic 5 up in Seattle, and then go to Midwest Showdown 5 over in Michigan.

01:33:28.040 --> 01:33:29.040
You silly DDR kid.

01:33:29.040 --> 01:33:31.040
Hey, you can suck my cock.

01:33:31.040 --> 01:33:33.040
He is.

01:33:33.040 --> 01:33:36.040
Hey, I got a bigger cock than you.

01:33:36.040 --> 01:33:38.040
And on that note, any final thoughts?

01:33:38.040 --> 01:33:42.040
I'm not going to respond to that because we all know that I have the bigger one.

01:33:42.040 --> 01:33:43.140
Okay, Milton.

01:33:43.140 --> 01:33:44.540
Oh.

01:33:44.540 --> 01:33:46.140
Oh, nevermind, go ahead.

01:33:46.140 --> 01:33:48.040
To be settled on a future episode.

01:33:48.040 --> 01:33:49.440
Uh, any final thoughts for the listeners?

01:33:49.440 --> 01:33:50.740
Write down the chapter where everyone's going.

01:33:50.740 --> 01:33:51.540
Dot, dot, dot.

01:33:51.540 --> 01:33:51.940
Dot, dot, dot.

01:33:51.940 --> 01:33:52.540
Change the subject.

01:33:52.540 --> 01:33:53.040
Dot, dot, dot.

01:33:53.040 --> 01:33:54.540
I can't score the title.

01:33:54.540 --> 01:33:56.040
Oh, my God, the imagery, the imagery.

01:33:56.040 --> 01:33:58.740
Alright, right now I'm pitching fucking twin saying like,

01:33:58.740 --> 01:34:00.940
what the fuck?

01:34:00.940 --> 01:34:03.040
And then, and then there's fucking, um.

01:34:03.040 --> 01:34:04.440
I'm gonna beat, I'm gonna beat that name out

01:34:04.440 --> 01:34:06.740
because we don't, we don't talk about that.

01:34:06.740 --> 01:34:07.740
You're gonna beat twin out?

01:34:07.740 --> 01:34:09.040
Yeah, we're gonna beat that name out.

01:34:09.040 --> 01:34:11.340
What?

01:34:11.340 --> 01:34:13.340
You can't talk about retards on your show?

01:34:13.340 --> 01:34:15.340
Well, okay, I guess we can make it a-

01:34:15.340 --> 01:34:16.340
Just cuz you're Ver2!

01:34:16.340 --> 01:34:18.340
Yes, Jamie?

01:34:18.340 --> 01:34:20.340
By the way, I encourage leaving that intact.

01:34:20.340 --> 01:34:24.340
Yes, so thanks to Jamie, we didn't beep it.

01:34:24.340 --> 01:34:26.340
Jamie convinced me that we shouldn't beep it.

01:34:26.340 --> 01:34:27.340
You're welcome, Corey.

01:34:27.340 --> 01:34:29.340
Here we go. Moving right along.

01:34:29.340 --> 01:34:33.340
I'm gonna be honest with you, your channel is almost as bad as DDR Maniac.

01:34:33.340 --> 01:34:35.340
The channel is-

01:34:35.340 --> 01:34:36.340
Why's that?

01:34:36.340 --> 01:34:38.340
Because it's filled with twin.

01:34:38.340 --> 01:34:40.340
Not anymore, we banned his ass like a month ago.

01:34:40.340 --> 01:34:45.340
That's how long I've been gone because twins there.

01:34:45.340 --> 01:34:47.340
Jesus Christ.

01:34:47.340 --> 01:34:49.340
Hello, welcome to five minutes ago.

01:34:49.340 --> 01:34:50.340
Alright, any final thoughts?

01:34:50.340 --> 01:34:52.340
Um, see you guys at Surrogate Nation?

01:34:52.340 --> 01:34:55.340
I'm expecting another interview at Surrogate Nation.

01:34:55.340 --> 01:34:56.340
We'll see.

01:34:56.340 --> 01:34:57.340
We'll see.

01:34:57.340 --> 01:35:00.340
How much if I bribe you while I give an interview?

01:35:00.340 --> 01:35:02.340
Maybe if I get to play that controller that you win.

01:35:02.340 --> 01:35:05.340
Uh, we're tired of listening to Virtu, we want to hear some Kyle Snyder.

01:35:05.340 --> 01:35:07.340
No! It's all about me!

01:35:07.340 --> 01:35:08.340
I mean, Snyder!

01:35:08.340 --> 01:35:11.340
Why don't we interview this fellow over here?

01:35:11.340 --> 01:35:16.340
Actually, before we interview that fellow over there, Jamie wanted to read something for all you folks.

01:35:16.340 --> 01:35:22.340
This is an email sent by Twin bragging about all the channels he's been banned from.

01:35:22.340 --> 01:35:29.340
Actually, this was an email sent by Twin because I told him to fuck off for trying to start shit last week,

01:35:29.340 --> 01:35:32.340
and the dumbass, he emailed me back and was like,

01:35:32.340 --> 01:35:35.580
Oh, please, please, please, can you send me the arcade diss for DDRX stream?

01:35:35.580 --> 01:35:38.660
Like I'm going to say, oh, okay, I'll just totally forget that.

01:35:38.660 --> 01:35:43.700
But instead he's like, hey, Loki, this is the only other way I know how to get in contact with you.

01:35:43.700 --> 01:35:46.300
He sent me an email through my website because there's a form.

01:35:46.300 --> 01:35:53.260
Since I'm banned from DDR Maniacs, ItMusic, BimaniStyle, DDR UK, and Orange Lounge.

01:35:53.260 --> 01:35:55.860
Congratulations.

01:35:55.860 --> 01:35:58.940
Congratulations, you suck.

01:35:58.940 --> 01:36:01.060
All right, moving right along with the interviews.

01:36:44.380 --> 01:36:48.500
would you like to put myself on the list of it means is that it means with that

01:36:48.500 --> 01:36:49.620

i have my camera she got ahead of for me

01:36:51.980 --> 01:36:53.820
i had a before her interview

01:36:53.820 --> 01:36:56.500
hi so what's your name

01:36:56.500 --> 01:36:58.500
Alex, what's your...

01:36:58.500 --> 01:37:00.500
Mr. Cool.

01:37:00.500 --> 01:37:02.500
Mr. Cool.

01:37:02.500 --> 01:37:04.500
And what's it supposed to mean?

01:37:04.500 --> 01:37:06.500
Actually, I got it. It's a nickname.

01:37:06.500 --> 01:37:09.500
During class one day, we were talking about rappers.

01:37:09.500 --> 01:37:11.500
I said something about Mr. Cool.

01:37:11.500 --> 01:37:14.500
One of my friends misunderstood me from Mr. Cool.

01:37:14.500 --> 01:37:16.500
So that's pretty much how I got the name.

01:37:16.500 --> 01:37:18.500
And so...

01:37:18.500 --> 01:37:21.500
That's funny that it happened in school, because it's like, be cool, stay in school.

01:37:21.500 --> 01:37:23.500
Yeah.

01:37:23.500 --> 01:37:25.500
Did you stay in school?

01:37:25.500 --> 01:37:28.500
I didn't stay in college, but I'm not a role model, so it's okay.

01:37:28.500 --> 01:37:29.500
You're not cool.

01:37:29.500 --> 01:37:31.500
I know.

01:37:31.500 --> 01:37:33.500
I drink and smoke crack.

01:37:33.500 --> 01:37:35.500
But anyway, I'm sorry, I'm not being interviewed.

01:37:35.500 --> 01:37:37.500
He oozes sex as well.

01:37:37.500 --> 01:37:40.500
So, what are you doing today at the tournament?

01:37:40.500 --> 01:37:41.500
Are you an MPA, freestyle?

01:37:41.500 --> 01:37:42.500
Freestyle.

01:37:42.500 --> 01:37:43.500
Improv freestyle, yeah.

01:37:43.500 --> 01:37:44.500
Freestyle.

01:37:44.500 --> 01:37:45.500
What's the mode if you're going with?

01:37:45.500 --> 01:37:46.500
Mode?

01:37:46.500 --> 01:37:47.500
Mode.

01:37:47.500 --> 01:37:48.500
Any theme?

01:37:48.500 --> 01:37:49.500
No, I'm just...

01:37:49.500 --> 01:37:50.500
No.

01:37:50.500 --> 01:37:53.500
I'm just hoping I have a fast line and just do whatever.

01:37:53.500 --> 01:37:56.500
Do you plan to do hand drops and hand plants and knee drops?

01:37:56.500 --> 01:37:57.500
Stupid!

01:37:57.500 --> 01:37:58.500
No.

01:37:58.500 --> 01:37:59.500
What was that?

01:37:59.500 --> 01:38:00.500
No.

01:38:00.500 --> 01:38:02.500
Are you praying for dynamite rave?

01:38:02.500 --> 01:38:03.500
Definitely.

01:38:03.500 --> 01:38:05.500
As long as I get that song, I'll be good.

01:38:05.500 --> 01:38:06.500
If not, I'll argue.

01:38:06.500 --> 01:38:08.500
Can we see a bar hop in your routine?

01:38:08.500 --> 01:38:09.500
Yeah, no.

01:38:09.500 --> 01:38:10.500
No.

01:38:10.500 --> 01:38:11.500
No, we can't see any bar hops?

01:38:11.500 --> 01:38:13.500
I think I'll get disqualified.

01:38:13.500 --> 01:38:14.500
The bar.

01:38:14.500 --> 01:38:15.500
The bar's your friend.

01:38:15.500 --> 01:38:16.500
I know.

01:38:16.500 --> 01:38:17.500
I know.

01:38:17.500 --> 01:38:18.500
I like the bar.

01:38:18.500 --> 01:38:21.500
But I would rather, uh, jump over the bar.

01:38:21.500 --> 01:38:27.780
the bar. Do you have any final words for the listeners? No. Okay, that's you. I'm better

01:38:27.780 --> 01:38:34.660
than you. Peace out. Hey, all right. The tournament's over now, but I got one more interview tonight

01:38:34.660 --> 01:38:38.560
because I missed him at Fremont. I promised to interview this guy at Fremont and I completely

01:38:38.560 --> 01:38:43.020
forgot because I'm an asshole, but here he is. Introduce yourself for our listening audience.

01:38:43.020 --> 01:38:49.700
I'm Ben, aka Chubbs, and that's all I got to say about that. How you doing? I'm not

01:38:49.700 --> 01:38:55.580
that I guess. What brought you to the Milpitas tournament tonight? Well, I was judging, so

01:38:55.580 --> 01:39:01.740
if I didn't come, I think Milton would be angry with me. Sounds pretty reasonable. So

01:39:01.740 --> 01:39:05.820
what kinds of things were you looking for tonight in the improv routines? Well, my specific

01:39:05.820 --> 01:39:11.980
category as a judge was looking for the charisma, so that was the only thing I was judging on.

01:39:11.980 --> 01:39:15.900
What kind of like good, what were some of the good qualities that you saw tonight, the

01:39:15.900 --> 01:39:19.340
better charismatic things that you saw tonight?

01:39:19.340 --> 01:39:24.060
Well, little B was facing the crowd pretty much the whole time, and that was pretty good

01:39:24.060 --> 01:39:28.460
for Chris, man. He looked like he was having a pretty good time, too. JC also, like those

01:39:28.460 --> 01:39:32.900
two in my book, were pretty close. Those were probably the only good ones.

01:39:32.900 --> 01:39:36.220
What do you think about judging improv versus judging routines?

01:39:36.220 --> 01:39:42.980
Judging routines is probably easier, because there's not just one specific thing you judge,

01:39:42.980 --> 01:39:44.580
it's just judging the whole routine.

01:39:44.580 --> 01:39:49.580
Yeah, but at least when you see a bad one, it's not so painful when it's improv, right?

01:39:49.580 --> 01:39:52.580
Yeah, because they have an excuse.

01:39:52.580 --> 01:39:57.580
Right on. So what other kinds of events are you going to be attending in the near future? Anything you want to plug, or I don't know?

01:39:57.580 --> 01:40:06.580
I don't know. I'm just going to go to pretty much every tournament in the future. We've active basic, CVN, and I don't know what's after that.

01:40:06.580 --> 01:40:08.580
How'd you do in Perfect Attack? Did you do Perfect Attack today?

01:40:08.580 --> 01:40:10.580
Yeah, I got third.

01:40:10.580 --> 01:40:11.580
Not too shabby.

01:40:11.580 --> 01:40:14.800
Kind of see Milton fucked up and

01:40:16.320 --> 01:40:22.340
He forgot to have the third place match between me and chaos. So yeah, we're splitting third

01:40:22.980 --> 01:40:28.020
It's all good works. So any other final thoughts you have for the folks out there listening?

01:40:30.340 --> 01:40:32.060
No

01:40:32.060 --> 01:40:39.260
All right, that works. I think we're all tired as hell and it's time to go home. So that's it. Milpitas Golf Land

01:40:39.260 --> 01:40:41.140
We're out. Bye

01:40:41.140 --> 01:40:44.140
Alright, we're back. That was it, the Milpitas Interviews.

01:40:44.140 --> 01:40:48.140
So, we're going to take a quick break and we're going to come back and we're going to do a list list segment.

01:40:48.140 --> 01:40:54.140
Actually, I want to play this sound file. SoCal Kicks sent this to me, and we haven't heard this yet.

01:40:54.140 --> 01:40:59.580
heard this yet. It's called Sky in the Year 1986, which is kind of a scary sound title

01:40:59.580 --> 01:41:02.580
name. I haven't even heard this yet, so let's try this.

01:41:02.580 --> 01:41:16.580
Don't forget, Love Fist are in town right now. What is it? Love Fist is in town. Whatever.

01:41:16.580 --> 01:41:22.580
I flunk school because I'm hardcore. What? I've never even said that shit in my life.

01:41:22.580 --> 01:41:24.500
What is this?

01:41:24.500 --> 01:41:25.660
It's from Vice City.

01:41:25.660 --> 01:41:28.500
And that guy supposedly sounds like me or something?

01:41:28.500 --> 01:41:32.780
Somebody was telling me the other day that I sound like some guy in Vice City.

01:41:32.780 --> 01:41:33.780
Rob's famous.

01:41:33.780 --> 01:41:34.420
That's scary.

01:41:34.420 --> 01:41:35.140
I'm famous.

01:41:35.140 --> 01:41:35.740
Infamous.

01:41:35.740 --> 01:41:38.060
That is me, damn it.

01:41:38.060 --> 01:41:38.540
Yeah, right.

01:41:38.540 --> 01:41:39.020
Anyway.

01:41:39.020 --> 01:41:39.500
OK, yes.

01:41:39.500 --> 01:41:40.060
We're going to take a break.

01:41:40.060 --> 01:41:41.420
When we come back, we're going to do a list list.

01:41:41.420 --> 01:41:43.700
And that means you all get to participate.

01:41:43.700 --> 01:41:45.100
And you're going to vote.

01:41:45.100 --> 01:41:47.020
So here's a hint, you guys.

01:41:47.020 --> 01:41:49.020
During the break, you're going to get a big hint

01:41:49.020 --> 01:41:51.260
as to what our list list topic is tonight.

01:41:51.260 --> 01:41:52.260
Enjoy.

01:41:52.260 --> 01:41:56.420
I'm supposed to say hi to Strong Brad and apologizing for not interviewing him at MIGL.

01:41:56.420 --> 01:41:58.020
We'll get him next time.

01:41:58.020 --> 01:42:02.420
The next interviews, by the way, will be at Cyberbeat Nation in a couple weeks.

01:42:02.420 --> 01:42:08.100
There might even be a whole separate special out of that, like a different error tape thing.

01:42:08.100 --> 01:42:09.100
I'm not sure yet.

01:42:09.100 --> 01:42:10.940
We have to talk about that, all the hosts.

01:42:10.940 --> 01:42:13.740
Anyway, I do not sound like Cookie from You Don't Know Jack.

01:42:13.740 --> 01:42:14.740
Fuck off.

01:42:14.740 --> 01:42:15.740
Shut up!

01:42:15.740 --> 01:42:16.740
All of you!

01:42:16.740 --> 01:42:17.740
Shut up!

01:42:17.740 --> 01:42:18.740
All right, we'll be back.

01:42:18.740 --> 01:42:26.740
I'll do it all night, do it with me, I'll take you to heaven if you make me feel free, babe

01:42:26.740 --> 01:42:32.740
Do it tonight, do it alright, just take me and shake me till I burn up in time

01:42:32.740 --> 01:42:34.740
I know

01:42:47.940 --> 01:42:51.220
You may have good sex with salmon, fred, and drizzle max

01:42:51.220 --> 01:42:54.580
You may be the slave of Tim and Tom and Ed today

01:42:54.580 --> 01:42:57.940
You may do it again with hands and friends and check and care

01:42:57.940 --> 01:43:01.220
But you're gonna feel so free when you're doing it with me

01:43:01.220 --> 01:43:05.220
Do it all night, do it with me

01:43:05.220 --> 01:43:08.220
I'll take you to heaven if you make me feel free, baby

01:43:08.220 --> 01:43:11.220
Do it tonight, do it all right

01:43:11.220 --> 01:43:14.220
Just take me and shake me till I burn up inside

01:43:14.220 --> 01:43:18.220
Oh, do it all night, do it with me

01:43:18.220 --> 01:43:21.220
As hot as a fire and as strong as a dream

01:43:21.220 --> 01:43:25.220
Do it tonight, do it all right

01:43:25.220 --> 01:43:28.220
You got it, I knew it, you can do it tonight

01:43:28.220 --> 01:43:43.220
This time is a fire, this is a troll, this is a dream

01:43:43.220 --> 01:43:45.220
Come on, do it with me

01:43:45.220 --> 01:43:51.220
Kiss me, light me up high, wanna feel like a frisbee

01:43:51.220 --> 01:43:54.220
High in the sky, oh I want you to kiss me

01:43:54.220 --> 01:43:57.220
Do it alright, cause I know that you miss me

01:43:57.220 --> 01:43:59.220
Whoa, whoa, whoa

Watching love you in so many lonely nights

01:44:14.220 --> 01:44:16.220
With my body and soul and I know you around

01:44:17.220 --> 01:44:19.220
There in the city lights

01:44:20.220 --> 01:44:21.220
Just out of control

01:44:21.220 --> 01:44:23.220
I walk around and all my friends walk through my floor

01:44:23.220 --> 01:44:25.220
Just lose their ground, I'm near to you but I walk behind

01:44:25.220 --> 01:44:28.220
Like the sound in the sky, all the time they watch your face

01:44:28.220 --> 01:44:30.220
You own the distance and the race, love me

01:44:30.220 --> 01:44:33.220
In the heat of the night, babe I feel like dynamite

01:44:33.220 --> 01:44:35.220
Oh baby just kiss me, body up high

01:44:35.220 --> 01:44:37.220

01:45:00.220 --> 01:45:02.220
Fly in the sky, oh I want you to kiss me

01:45:02.220 --> 01:45:03.220

Whoa, whoa, whoa, kiss me all over tonight Kiss me all over tonight

01:45:17.220 --> 01:45:38.940
Hello kids, welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio.

I missed an FU that came in over email.

01:45:42.300 --> 01:45:45.900
What happened is I'd actually read it before the show and then forgot to get back to it

01:45:45.900 --> 01:45:50.460

01:45:50.460 --> 01:45:53.780

01:45:53.780 --> 01:46:00.420
missed it so let's get to her f you her f you is fuck you to my graveyard shift

01:46:00.420 --> 01:46:03.860

So my bad, I missed that earlier in the show, please accept my apology!

01:46:23.760 --> 01:46:27.080
And does anybody know the final results from MGL?

01:46:27.080 --> 01:46:28.560
Good question.

01:46:28.560 --> 01:46:35.280
First place in Perfect Attack was Tigger, second was Virtu, and third was Chubbs and

01:46:35.280 --> 01:46:38.680
Chaos I believe tied, I hope I didn't fuck that up.

01:46:38.680 --> 01:46:47.240
freestyle, improv freestyle. First was JC, I believe his name was. Second place was,

01:46:47.240 --> 01:46:52.280
oh, I can look it up on DER for you, that's a good idea. I know second place was Lil B.

01:46:52.280 --> 01:46:58.840
Third place was somebody else. I don't remember who third place was. Let me look. I know Oakey

01:46:58.840 --> 01:47:02.520
was in fourth. Oh, I think, yes, yes, because Fuzzy Cat won money. He was excited he won

01:47:02.520 --> 01:47:04.520
Fuzzy Hat was third, you're right. Thank you.

01:47:05.520 --> 01:47:06.520
Alright.

01:47:08.520 --> 01:47:10.520
Alright, thank you. You guys, uh...

01:47:11.520 --> 01:47:15.520
Hey, and even... One of the judges is in the chat room. I'm so retarded I didn't even think to ask.

01:47:15.520 --> 01:47:17.520
But she's... Jenny Bean does confirm that yes.

01:47:17.520 --> 01:47:18.520
Hello, by the way, Jenny.

01:47:18.520 --> 01:47:21.520
Uh, JC, Lil B, and Fuzzy. One, two, and three right there.

01:47:21.520 --> 01:47:22.520
Alright.

01:47:22.520 --> 01:47:24.520
Alright, now we get to our favorite part of the show.

01:47:24.520 --> 01:47:26.520
Uh, Angel also says fuck you to her handful.

01:47:26.520 --> 01:47:29.520
Well, my second favorite part of the show... Actually, my favorite part of the show is the fuck you to the week, but...

01:47:29.520 --> 01:47:30.520
Our other favorite part of the show.

01:47:30.520 --> 01:47:31.520
Yay!

01:47:31.520 --> 01:47:35.800
yay it's the list list and tonight the topic is the list list

01:47:35.800 --> 01:47:39.480
are you sure you should do a theme song? No. Sing us a theme song.

01:47:39.480 --> 01:47:41.680
It's a list list, yay.

01:47:41.680 --> 01:47:46.920
You're on a roll there. We'll get...

01:47:46.920 --> 01:47:51.680
Everybody. That's what the fucking song is.

01:47:51.680 --> 01:47:52.680
You know what?

01:47:52.680 --> 01:47:58.000
You know what? We're gonna get...

01:47:58.000 --> 01:48:00.000
No, this is not Dancer. I'm blowing up people's speakers.

01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:01.000
Sunday, Sunday, Sunday, it's the list list.

01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:02.000
Um, okay.

01:48:03.000 --> 01:48:05.000
Oh, where were we? Yes, list list, nice list list.

01:48:06.000 --> 01:48:10.000
Title, er, um, song that Erotic needs to do.

01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:12.000
A possible title for a new Erotic song.

01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:16.000
This is actually coming from my, uh, my fuck off show from Tuesday, was it?

01:48:16.000 --> 01:48:19.000
Where we were, like, coming up with Erotic song titles in the chat room.

01:48:20.000 --> 01:48:24.000
Which I'm actually doing a, a, a, one of them on my list.

01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:29.000
Alright, so these are all songs that Erotic hasn't done, but they should.

01:48:29.000 --> 01:48:33.000
So, starting off, we've got, who's all participating in the room?

01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:35.000
Raise your hands so I make sure I don't miss everyone.

01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:36.000
One, two, three, four, five, six.

01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:38.000
Okay, we've got six people participating, so we've got quite a few.

01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:41.000
Ryan is participating, but...

01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:43.000
Ryan is reading for Ryan.

01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:45.000
I'm reading for someone else, so these aren't mine.

01:48:45.000 --> 01:48:45.000
Alright.

01:48:45.000 --> 01:48:46.000
I'm reading for Ryan.

01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:47.000
And then we have the other Ryan.

01:48:47.000 --> 01:48:48.000
We have Puppy Ryan.

01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:48.000

01:53:55.340 --> 01:53:59.340
I'm shortening that to just hurry up and shoot it in my eyes because that's too long.

01:54:00.340 --> 01:54:03.340
We got a lot of great suggestions from the chat room.

02:00:16.200 --> 02:00:19.000
That's just like the nastiest list ever and I love it.

02:00:19.000 --> 02:00:20.000
Damn it.

02:00:20.000 --> 02:00:22.160
Oh, did we get...

02:00:22.160 --> 02:00:24.320
Chat cookies flipping out.

02:00:24.320 --> 02:00:25.320
Check cookies.

02:00:25.320 --> 02:00:26.320
Can somebody please...

02:00:26.320 --> 02:00:27.320
Diop, chat cookie, thank you.

02:00:27.320 --> 02:00:28.320
Chat cookies being an ass.

02:00:28.320 --> 02:00:29.320
All right.

02:00:29.320 --> 02:00:30.320
All right.

02:00:30.320 --> 02:00:31.320
Thank you.

02:00:31.320 --> 02:00:38.320
Let's see. I said I'd give inspiration. I'm trying to find another erotic song we haven't played yet.

02:00:38.320 --> 02:00:41.320
Sex on the Phone? I don't even know.

02:00:41.320 --> 02:00:43.320
Oh, yes I do. We have Max Stone have sex with you.

02:00:43.320 --> 02:00:45.320
Find something, dammit.

02:00:45.320 --> 02:00:46.320
I'm finding it, I'm looking, I'm looking.

02:00:46.320 --> 02:00:47.320
Find, find, find.

02:00:47.320 --> 02:00:51.320
Alright, here we go. We'll be right back after this quick song and we'll reveal the results. So vote now!

02:00:51.320 --> 02:00:52.320
Vote, dammit.

02:00:52.320 --> 02:00:54.320
Damnit

02:02:52.320 --> 02:02:56.320
I don't wanna make you feel so wrong I know that what I'm gonna do

02:02:56.320 --> 02:03:02.320
I gotta warn you, sex, sex, baby, wax It'll make you like a sex mind, baby

02:03:02.320 --> 02:03:09.320
Baby, take it easy, sex, sex, baby, wax It'll knock you off the lights, off the lights

02:03:09.320 --> 02:03:16.320
So you're cool and shy, sex, sex, baby, wax I gotta warn you, sex, sex, baby, wax

02:03:16.320 --> 02:03:20.320
Don't have sex with your ex-wife

02:03:38.320 --> 02:03:40.320
Oh, sex

02:04:10.320 --> 02:04:16.680
We'll knock you out, relax, relax, play it cool and just relax, relax, relax

02:04:16.680 --> 02:04:19.680
I got a boy, I need a boy

02:04:19.680 --> 02:04:24.680
Lord, you're so sweet, relax, relax, relax

02:04:28.680 --> 02:04:31.680
Alright, last call for votes, send them in now

02:04:31.680 --> 02:04:33.680
In the meantime we're gonna play a remix from Max 2

02:04:33.680 --> 02:04:37.680
And hurry it up, send in the votes, you only got like 10 more seconds

02:04:37.680 --> 02:04:39.680
So send it now or never send it.

02:05:07.680 --> 02:05:33.680
And now step forward to Lambda, set up the rating on the 12 mode through program 1.

02:06:03.680 --> 02:06:18.620
And now it's time for Erotic Pop Idol, where we will find the next singer for everyone's

02:06:18.620 --> 02:06:21.180
favorite perverse baumannii band, Erotic.

02:06:21.180 --> 02:06:22.820
Do it all night.

02:06:22.820 --> 02:06:24.300
Do it with me.

02:06:24.300 --> 02:06:26.940
No, no, that was awful, bloody terrible.

02:06:26.940 --> 02:06:28.300
Do you take vocal lessons?

02:06:28.300 --> 02:06:29.300
Kill your teacher.

02:06:29.300 --> 02:06:31.140
In the heat of the night.

02:06:31.140 --> 02:06:33.660
Oh God, I think my ears are bleeding.

02:06:33.660 --> 02:06:35.660
I liked it!

02:06:35.660 --> 02:06:38.660
Shut the bloody hell up, Paula! Next!

02:06:38.660 --> 02:06:43.660
Oh, that was cool.

02:06:43.660 --> 02:06:48.660
Do you even know why you're here? That was just bloody pathetic! Next!

02:06:48.660 --> 02:06:52.660
Come on, man. Come on, do it with me.

02:06:52.660 --> 02:06:56.660
Yes! Yes, that's it! We have a winner!

02:06:56.660 --> 02:07:01.660
A star is born here on Orange Lounge Radio.

02:07:01.660 --> 02:07:08.020
Alright, we have the results for what has been one of our most popular, I think it's

02:07:08.020 --> 02:07:11.500
one of our most popular listless segments we've ever done here on this show.

02:07:11.500 --> 02:07:12.500
It was fun.

02:07:12.500 --> 02:07:13.500
It was fun, that's for sure.

02:07:13.500 --> 02:07:15.740
You remember that adult content disclaimer at the beginning of the show?

02:07:15.740 --> 02:07:16.740
I hope you all were listening.

02:07:16.740 --> 02:07:17.740
Yeah, pay attention.

02:07:17.740 --> 02:07:21.860
And when I posted about this on the DDR Community Live Journal, I put, you know, warning, there's

02:07:21.860 --> 02:07:25.500
some adult content on this program if you all are like 12 years old.

02:07:25.500 --> 02:07:26.500
Some.

02:07:26.500 --> 02:07:27.500
Some.

02:07:27.500 --> 02:07:29.460
Everybody at once in here, some!

02:07:29.460 --> 02:07:31.020
Don't you ever talk about DDR on that show?

02:07:31.020 --> 02:07:34.020
All you ever talk about is porn. Oh, yes, the list. Here we go.

02:07:34.020 --> 02:07:37.020
Uh, I'm gonna give Jamie the distinct pleasure of getting to read these,

02:07:37.020 --> 02:07:41.020
because we all love, uh, when a, you know, woman's saying these dirty things to us.

02:07:41.020 --> 02:07:42.020
Number three.

02:07:42.020 --> 02:07:43.020
All right, the number three winner is...

02:07:43.020 --> 02:07:44.020
I like it in the ass. No.

02:07:44.020 --> 02:07:46.020
No, that wasn't one of the choices.

02:07:46.020 --> 02:07:48.020
Last week on Orange Lounge Radio.

02:07:48.020 --> 02:07:50.020
Shut up. We don't even do this anymore.

02:07:50.020 --> 02:07:51.020
All right.

02:07:51.020 --> 02:07:53.020
Number three is Temple of Butt.

02:07:53.020 --> 02:07:56.020
Yay! Temple of Butt. All right.

02:07:56.020 --> 02:07:59.020
Number two. Hundred Midget Game Bang.

02:07:59.020 --> 02:08:01.020
hundred-digit gang bang, yay!

02:08:01.020 --> 02:08:03.020
And number one!

02:08:03.020 --> 02:08:05.020
Sam Lick My Clam.

02:08:05.020 --> 02:08:07.020
Sam Lick My Clam!

02:08:07.020 --> 02:08:09.020
Wow, that was a last-minute entry, too.

02:08:09.020 --> 02:08:11.020
And you know what?

02:08:11.020 --> 02:08:13.020
It's all three of us.

02:08:13.020 --> 02:08:15.020
It's the host circle.

02:08:15.020 --> 02:08:17.020
With of course me being number one,

02:08:17.020 --> 02:08:19.020
because I'm the best.

02:08:19.020 --> 02:08:21.020
And you all love me and worship me like the goddess I am.

02:08:21.020 --> 02:08:23.020
So Sam Lick My Clam is where I am.

02:08:23.020 --> 02:08:25.020
I still like Temple of But.

02:08:25.020 --> 02:08:27.020
See, Brad's bowing down to me.

02:08:27.020 --> 02:08:29.460
like watching my ex have hot man sex.

02:08:29.460 --> 02:08:30.460
That was a good one.

02:08:30.460 --> 02:08:31.460
That was very close.

02:08:31.460 --> 02:08:32.460
It was very close.

02:08:32.460 --> 02:08:33.460
That was almost in there.

02:08:33.460 --> 02:08:37.980
Um, Brad, can you sing us Temple of Butt one more time?

02:08:37.980 --> 02:08:38.980
What?

02:08:38.980 --> 02:08:40.980
Sing Temple of Butt.

02:08:40.980 --> 02:08:41.980
Okay.

02:08:41.980 --> 02:08:43.540
Temple of Butt.

02:08:43.540 --> 02:08:45.540
Come and do the Temple of Butt.

02:08:45.540 --> 02:08:46.540
Alright.

02:08:46.540 --> 02:08:47.540
Anyway.

02:08:47.540 --> 02:08:50.020
I was thinking it's the Winnie the Pooh theme.

02:08:50.020 --> 02:08:51.700
We still have a cage match.

02:08:51.700 --> 02:08:53.100
We still have a cage match to do.

02:08:53.100 --> 02:08:54.100
Temple of Butt.

02:08:54.100 --> 02:08:55.100
Oh, okay.

02:08:55.100 --> 02:08:56.100
We want to do this.

02:08:56.100 --> 02:09:03.100
what you talk about this

02:09:04.300 --> 02:09:08.500
guys are weird suddenly i'm in preschool again we're all everybody sitting here

02:09:08.500 --> 02:09:08.980
going

02:09:08.980 --> 02:09:15.980
will be looking at what i got hot hot hot hot back out again

02:09:23.900 --> 02:09:25.980
i still i still think this

02:09:25.980 --> 02:09:49.940
The end is fucked up because it's not finished yet and I have to hurry to get it done, so

02:09:49.940 --> 02:09:53.460
you'll notice that the rest of the song sounds cool in the end, you're like, huh?

02:09:53.460 --> 02:09:57.900
So this is a sort of trance remix of Legend of Max.

02:09:57.900 --> 02:09:58.780
Now why did you do this?

02:09:58.780 --> 02:10:01.220
Just for the hell of it, or did you do it for that little contest that's going on

02:10:01.220 --> 02:10:02.420
about my style, or what's this about?

02:10:02.420 --> 02:10:03.500
I didn't know.

02:10:03.500 --> 02:10:06.260
I did it because I found the song that they got the vocals out of for

02:10:06.260 --> 02:10:08.780
Legend of Max, and that's the whole reason why.

02:10:08.780 --> 02:10:11.020
And I was like, woo, vocals!

02:10:11.020 --> 02:10:12.980
So are you going to enter this?

02:10:12.980 --> 02:10:14.900
You should enter this in the 2DX remixing contest.

02:10:14.900 --> 02:10:19.460
I know Legend of Max isn't a 2DX song yet, but you could call it a Max 300 mix,

02:10:19.460 --> 02:10:21.460
For one, they canceled that contest.

02:10:21.460 --> 02:10:23.460
What? Why?

02:10:23.460 --> 02:10:24.460
I don't know.

02:10:24.460 --> 02:10:25.460
Fuck that!

02:10:25.460 --> 02:10:26.460
So that's gone.

02:10:26.460 --> 02:10:30.460
And two, well I guess I could do, I have to finish it first.

02:10:30.460 --> 02:10:34.460
I have to, you know, get rid of some of the parts that don't sound quite right.

02:10:34.460 --> 02:10:38.460
But this is, until I come up with a better name, The Legend of Trance.

02:10:38.460 --> 02:10:40.460
Alright, so this is The Legend of Trance by Loki.

02:10:40.460 --> 02:10:42.460
Wait, would you make me a trance mix of something?

02:10:42.460 --> 02:10:44.460
Make me a trance mix too!

02:10:44.460 --> 02:10:46.460
Come on, I want a trance mix.

02:10:46.460 --> 02:10:48.460
I want a reality.

02:10:48.460 --> 02:10:56.740
We want to hear what you guys think about this in the chat room, so post your thoughts.

02:10:56.740 --> 02:11:00.100
You all can be a judge on American Idol right now and judge Loki.

02:11:00.100 --> 02:11:01.100
Won't this be fabulous?

02:11:01.100 --> 02:11:03.500
Okay, this is Legend of Trance here on Orange Mountain Radio.

02:12:01.100 --> 02:12:03.100
Oh

02:13:01.100 --> 02:13:10.900
10. 40. I'm wet right now. Yeah, I'm gonna give you 100. Change your pants. Already off

02:13:10.900 --> 02:13:17.580
the scale, but I'll give it a 9. Since it's my song, the end still needs work, especially

02:13:17.580 --> 02:13:21.940
that one, the second, like, slow down there where it says the death and then the fly need

02:13:21.940 --> 02:13:27.900
to really work on that from there on. That needs work, but yeah, I like it. It's pretty

02:13:27.900 --> 02:13:31.900
Well, let's just say it's off the scale. This one kicks hella ass.

02:13:31.900 --> 02:13:35.900
I can't really give it a number. This is over 10 or whatever.

02:13:35.900 --> 02:13:39.900
Just to say, do be continued on the numbers scale.

02:13:39.900 --> 02:13:43.900
AAA, then.

02:13:43.900 --> 02:13:47.900
You know, to be honest, it didn't sound a lot

02:13:47.900 --> 02:13:51.900
remixed, but, like, enough so that, like, you know, the Paranoias aren't really

02:13:51.900 --> 02:13:55.900
remixed that much either, so I think that fits into

02:13:55.900 --> 02:14:00.900
compared to most of the damn maxes I hear online

02:14:00.900 --> 02:14:02.900
actually to be honest I thought it was like

02:14:02.900 --> 02:14:04.900
hardly any max in there

02:14:04.900 --> 02:14:06.900
I don't know I just kind of heard the melody

02:14:06.900 --> 02:14:09.900
most of the stuff is off of tranceaddict.com

02:14:09.900 --> 02:14:11.900
I believe the song I used was called I'm Alone

02:14:11.900 --> 02:14:13.900
or something like that

02:14:13.900 --> 02:14:14.900
that was for most of it

02:14:14.900 --> 02:14:16.900
then there's another song by The Deep Project

02:14:16.900 --> 02:14:18.900
that's called The Fly

02:14:18.900 --> 02:14:20.900
which is where they got most of the

02:14:20.900 --> 02:14:21.900
Really?

02:14:21.900 --> 02:14:22.900
I've got the MP3 on there

02:14:22.900 --> 02:14:23.900
it's like 9 minutes long

02:14:23.900 --> 02:14:50.900
Hey, I'll buy you dinner if you make me like an ambient trance remix of the safari.

02:14:53.900 --> 02:14:57.900
We'll see. Okay, shit.

02:14:57.900 --> 02:15:05.900
Alright, speaking of the cage match, I think we ought to get to this week's version of it, shouldn't we?

02:15:05.900 --> 02:15:11.900
Alright, so, let's get into that.

02:15:11.900 --> 02:15:22.900
So, I'm finding the cage match theme music here that somebody requested earlier in the show we specifically not play.

02:15:22.900 --> 02:15:25.900
What are you taking that out for? We need that, don't we?

02:15:25.900 --> 02:15:28.900
Oh, mine's on there, but yours is on here.

02:15:28.900 --> 02:15:29.900
Oh, what? Eh?

02:15:29.900 --> 02:15:31.900
We'll do yours first, Logie.

02:15:31.900 --> 02:15:33.900
That's fine. Okay, bring yours in.

02:15:33.900 --> 02:15:35.900
Okay, never mind. We know what we're doing.

02:15:35.900 --> 02:15:37.900
Anyway, yes, last week.

02:15:37.900 --> 02:15:39.900
Last week on the Orange Lounge Cage Match.

02:15:39.900 --> 02:15:42.900
Free prize from last week, K.K. Cockmaster.

02:15:42.900 --> 02:15:43.900
Wait, wrong week.

02:15:43.900 --> 02:15:45.900
Uh, we had, the winner was, uh,

02:15:45.900 --> 02:15:48.900
Jamie brought in a Vincent D'Amour song,

02:15:48.900 --> 02:15:51.900
and it pretty much swept the floor.

02:15:51.900 --> 02:15:55.900
And it won, so we'll play a little clip of that.

02:15:55.900 --> 02:15:58.900
The way the cage match works, by the way, since I know we have a lot of new listeners tonight.

02:15:58.900 --> 02:16:03.900
Each host brings in one song, and we pit them all against each other.

02:16:03.900 --> 02:16:07.900
And so we have the winning song from last week, and then two new ones that go head-to-head.

02:16:07.900 --> 02:16:12.900
The winning song goes into rotation on the Orange Ons Radio's Bomani Music & More program.

02:16:12.900 --> 02:16:14.900

02:16:17.900 --> 02:16:19.900
Head-to-head, yes, that's what I said.

02:16:19.900 --> 02:16:20.900
I said head-to-head.

02:16:20.900 --> 02:16:25.560
Anyway last week. This is the winner so this is the first song you can vote for in this week's cage max

02:16:25.760 --> 02:16:29.440

02:16:29.440 --> 02:16:33.920
This is Vincent Amor with eternity from last week here on orange lounge radio

02:16:59.440 --> 02:17:01.440

All right, that was last week's winner. That was Vincent Amor with Eternity, last week's

02:17:42.000 --> 02:17:43.000
winner.

02:17:43.000 --> 02:17:44.000
I just had a happy moment with that song.

02:17:44.000 --> 02:17:47.640
It's already, the chat room's kind of slamming on Eternity. They don't know if they care

02:17:47.640 --> 02:17:51.880
for it anymore i think they're they're done with it so let's bring on the challengers

02:17:51.880 --> 02:17:58.280
i don't know jamie looks concerned she's giving the chat room the finger all right let's see i

02:17:58.280 --> 02:18:03.640
would have to say this song falls on a completely opposite scale of that song um this is going to

02:18:03.640 --> 02:18:09.400
be um once again the secretions uh local uh sacramento punk band and with their song i'm

02:18:09.400 --> 02:18:13.720

02:18:13.720 --> 02:18:17.000
DDR size song, but if you want to vote for it do it

02:18:17.000 --> 02:18:21.880
This is the second pick in the orange lounge cage match the secretions with I'm gonna get you so laid

You're so fantastic, you're moving on

02:18:49.000 --> 02:18:51.000
You'll just sit and hold me, you won't be

02:18:51.000 --> 02:18:52.000
You write a fucked up song

02:18:52.000 --> 02:18:54.000
Put your arm into her hands

02:18:54.000 --> 02:18:56.000
Watch her act with it

02:18:56.000 --> 02:18:58.000
Now let me take you out and get you laid

02:18:59.000 --> 02:19:00.000
I could get you so bad

02:19:00.000 --> 02:19:02.000
I could get you so bad

02:19:02.000 --> 02:19:04.000
I could get you so bad

02:19:04.000 --> 02:19:06.000
I could get you so bad

02:19:08.000 --> 02:19:10.000
Said she loves you, said she knows you

02:19:10.000 --> 02:19:11.000
Said that she'd be true

02:19:11.000 --> 02:19:13.000
At last I'm not alone with someone

02:19:13.000 --> 02:19:15.000
I don't look like you

02:19:15.000 --> 02:19:16.000
Put your arm into her hands

02:19:16.000 --> 02:19:23.000

I'm gonna get you laid, paid, paid, paid, paid, paid, paid, paid

02:19:47.000 --> 02:19:49.000
Well thank you very much for coming tonight!

02:20:17.000 --> 02:20:21.000
The chat room doesn't listen to punk, so they won't appreciate it as much as I do.

02:20:21.000 --> 02:20:24.000
Well, gee, aren't we elitists when it comes to music?

02:20:24.000 --> 02:20:25.000
Exactly.

02:20:25.000 --> 02:20:27.000
Alright, and Jonas, your pick.

02:20:27.000 --> 02:20:28.000
7.5.

02:20:28.000 --> 02:20:29.000
7.5.

02:20:29.000 --> 02:20:30.000
Uh, I'm gonna give it a 5.

02:20:30.000 --> 02:20:31.000
I've heard better punk.

02:20:31.000 --> 02:20:37.000
It was alright, but Little Bitch is better for DDR, but Pain is better than that.

02:20:37.000 --> 02:20:39.000
But, it was alright.

02:20:39.000 --> 02:20:44.000
It's like, if I was at a concert, I'd wanna, like, punch somebody to that song, so that's cool.

02:20:44.000 --> 02:20:48.000
It's not for Orange Lounge, though. It ain't for Orange Lounge, I don't think.

02:20:48.000 --> 02:20:51.000
We'll see. We'll see.

02:20:51.000 --> 02:20:54.000
Alright, so that's your other pick.

02:20:54.000 --> 02:20:57.000
Rob, Rob, I can't do that, so I have to listen to Pat.

02:20:57.000 --> 02:20:58.000
Alright.

02:20:58.000 --> 02:21:01.000
We have Vincent Noire with Eternity, the Supreeces, but I'm going to get you so late.

02:21:01.000 --> 02:21:03.000
And here's the third pick.

02:21:03.000 --> 02:21:06.000
And I don't have an artist for this one. I'm trying to get that this week.

02:21:06.000 --> 02:21:13.000
But this was actually given to me by our buddy Tal, who was here earlier in the show.

02:21:13.000 --> 02:21:17.960
he had this posted on his website this is a song called the terrible mr.

02:21:17.960 --> 02:21:22.680
Grimshaw and what this is this they recorded some guy playing counter-strike

02:21:22.680 --> 02:21:27.480
or half-life or one of those life-killing games and they taped this

02:21:27.480 --> 02:21:32.140
guy playing it and swearing and then they did a techno remix of it and it

02:21:32.140 --> 02:21:35.880
kicks ass so you guys have to hear this this is my pick for the cage match this

02:21:35.880 --> 02:21:39.880
This is the terrible Mr. Grimshaw, here on Orange Lounge Radio.

02:21:39.880 --> 02:21:53.020

02:23:50.540 --> 02:23:52.540

02:23:52.540 --> 02:23:54.540
Don't shoot at me!

02:23:54.540 --> 02:23:56.540
I hate that!

02:23:56.540 --> 02:24:03.540
Did I get anyone? Did I have a fucking killin'? Did I get anyone? Did I have a fucking killin'?

02:24:03.540 --> 02:24:07.540
Dude, why the fuck? How did I get fucking shot?

02:24:07.540 --> 02:24:13.540
Just quit shooting me, the fuck you fucking assholes, dude. What the fuck happened?

02:24:13.540 --> 02:24:19.540
Bullshit. I fucking shot you like 50 fucking times. Fuck!

02:24:19.540 --> 02:24:36.780
oh god, oh my head, shit, fuck, ah, fuck, ah, shit, ah, fuck, god damn it, shit, fuck,

02:24:36.780 --> 02:25:04.980
I'm not fucking playing with that idiot right now.

02:25:04.980 --> 02:25:08.900
all right that was uh i'm being told the name of the group

02:25:08.900 --> 02:25:14.180
oh that's too loud hi i'm back the uh the name of the group is the murder

02:25:14.180 --> 02:25:19.860
simulators and that was the terrible mr grimshaw jamie already

02:25:19.860 --> 02:25:23.780
expressed her disgust for this song but let's hear it

02:25:23.780 --> 02:25:28.980
if it had a good background music i would give it a higher score

02:25:28.980 --> 02:25:33.980
I would give it a higher score, but I hear that all the time just hanging out with Dan.

02:25:33.980 --> 02:25:37.980
I'm hearing him talk shit on MECASOLD on Xbox Live.

02:25:37.980 --> 02:25:40.980
So I give that a 2.

02:25:40.980 --> 02:25:44.980
Because at least part of it we're in key.

02:25:44.980 --> 02:25:46.980
Zero.

02:25:46.980 --> 02:25:50.980
I don't know, I've played quite a bit of Half-Life with Counter-Strike

02:25:50.980 --> 02:25:52.980
if I can understand the guy's frustration.

02:25:52.980 --> 02:25:57.980
So I'd say I give that a 6.5, purely by his frustration.

02:25:57.980 --> 02:26:00.940
Alright Loki oh, yeah, Lita hokey

02:26:05.740 --> 02:26:07.740
I'll give it like a

02:26:08.020 --> 02:26:14.060
Like it's sick because they didn't even really it doesn't look like that. They paid it just was trying to put his

02:26:14.900 --> 02:26:16.900
Samples in there just to make it like a song

02:26:16.900 --> 02:26:22.900
but it didn't really seem like it came from the back of the soundtrack music, so it's like, I don't know, six, yeah.

02:26:22.900 --> 02:26:24.900
Alright, Jonas, what'd you think?

02:26:24.900 --> 02:26:26.900
I'll give it like a four.

02:26:27.900 --> 02:26:31.900
Well, first of all, there's really not much into the song at all.

02:26:34.900 --> 02:26:37.900
Fuck, shit, fuck.

02:26:37.900 --> 02:26:38.900
Alright.

02:26:38.900 --> 02:26:40.900
Anyone can make a song like that.

02:26:40.900 --> 02:26:47.460
It's like Brad's voice to game.

02:26:47.460 --> 02:26:53.780
Alright, I give it, I know the backbeat sucks, but like, come on, they're saying the f-words,

02:26:53.780 --> 02:26:55.780
that's always funny, I give it an 8.

02:26:55.780 --> 02:26:56.780
I'm a slagwerk!

02:26:56.780 --> 02:26:59.780
Alright, well a slagwerk I give a 10, but we're not talking about a slagwerk.

02:26:59.780 --> 02:27:03.020
I want to make it band and call it slagwerk.

02:27:03.020 --> 02:27:06.100
If I started doing mixes, I would just go as slagwerk.

02:27:06.100 --> 02:27:10.780

02:27:37.500 --> 02:27:38.500

Did the whole computer just freeze up there?

02:28:18.540 --> 02:28:19.540
No.

02:28:19.540 --> 02:28:20.540

What do you guys want to talk about now?

02:29:19.740 --> 02:29:23.740
There's a half hour left to show here.

02:29:23.740 --> 02:29:24.740
I like liquor.

02:29:24.740 --> 02:29:25.740
Okay, wait a minute.

02:29:25.740 --> 02:29:26.740
What?

02:29:26.740 --> 02:29:36.740
I just started myself a little character in Jamie's Animal Crossing Town, and I can't get Irene to get off so I can play.

02:29:56.740 --> 02:29:59.740
We need more female input on this show.

02:29:59.740 --> 02:30:00.740
Hey!

02:30:00.740 --> 02:30:02.740
Jamie has to make up for everybody.

02:30:02.740 --> 02:30:04.740
I have tit power.

02:30:04.740 --> 02:30:06.740
I can bring a few females.

02:30:06.740 --> 02:30:09.740
Let's have an all female orange lounge.

02:30:09.740 --> 02:30:10.740
Okay.

02:30:10.740 --> 02:30:12.740
Loki and I will leave town for the weekend.

02:30:12.740 --> 02:30:13.740
We did that.

02:30:13.740 --> 02:30:14.740
Oh yeah, we did that.

02:30:14.740 --> 02:30:15.740
That's right.

02:30:15.740 --> 02:30:16.740
But Ross was there.

02:30:16.740 --> 02:30:19.740
It was me and Jessica, but we had Ross and Dan.

02:30:19.740 --> 02:30:22.740
Hey everybody, do you want Dan to be on the show again?

02:30:22.740 --> 02:30:23.740
Send me your votes.

02:30:23.740 --> 02:30:24.740
Yay!

02:30:24.740 --> 02:30:31.740

02:30:35.180 --> 02:30:42.180
by my parent hang gliders

02:30:42.420 --> 02:30:45.300
all local i don't know what i want to talk about

02:30:45.300 --> 02:30:47.420
it's weird you know i got

02:30:47.420 --> 02:30:52.420
okay now if you don't like you have no taste my god

02:30:52.420 --> 02:30:56.420
I mean, whenever you work, you have taste.

02:30:56.420 --> 02:30:58.420
Oh, yeah.

02:30:58.420 --> 02:31:00.420
Oh, there's no time to keep holding me, son.

02:31:00.420 --> 02:31:01.420
Anyways, um, I was-

02:31:01.420 --> 02:31:04.420
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.

02:31:04.420 --> 02:31:06.420
You're only helping the situation.

02:31:06.420 --> 02:31:08.420
Anyways, so, um, I was going to talk about-

02:31:08.420 --> 02:31:10.420
There's this weird email I got.

02:31:10.420 --> 02:31:12.420
It's, I guess, some sort of scam that they send you.

02:31:12.420 --> 02:31:18.420
And, um, it is the strangest thing I've ever seen to try to actually, you know,

02:31:18.420 --> 02:31:23.420
get someone's personal info.

02:31:23.420 --> 02:31:30.420
It's actually an email sent to me from this web service that's in India.

02:31:30.420 --> 02:31:40.420
It's from some guy, and it's basically trying to convince you to launder $21 million into the country or some shit like that.

02:31:40.420 --> 02:31:45.420
So I guess I could read it here.

02:31:45.420 --> 02:31:47.420
Sorry, that's the twin male.

02:31:47.420 --> 02:31:49.420
No, twin male.

02:31:49.420 --> 02:31:51.420
Okay, here goes.

02:31:51.420 --> 02:31:57.420
Dear friend, I know this email will reach you as a surprise, but need not to worry,

02:31:57.420 --> 02:32:02.420
as we are using only secured and confidential medium available to seek foreign assistance.

02:32:02.420 --> 02:32:06.420
Yeah, secure and confidential yet is going to someone else and I got the email. Supposedly.

02:32:06.420 --> 02:32:09.420
Matt, why is your butt in my face?

02:32:09.420 --> 02:32:10.420
I don't know.

02:32:10.420 --> 02:32:18.420
Anyways, so, following the sudden death of my husband, General Sonya Batcha, the late former head of state, and I...

02:32:18.420 --> 02:32:20.420
Give us a Cliff Notes version.

02:32:20.420 --> 02:32:28.420
Okay, uh, some guy died, um, I want you to, um, to, uh, move my funds into the United States.

02:32:28.420 --> 02:32:29.420
You made me snort my propel.

02:32:29.420 --> 02:32:43.420
I'll give you 21.5 million dollars for doing that and all you have to do is send me your, let's see, you need to send me your full name, your company name and address and phone numbers and fax numbers.

02:32:43.420 --> 02:32:47.420
And you're sold. To my lawyer.

02:32:47.420 --> 02:32:49.420
And a big black cop.

02:32:49.420 --> 02:32:57.420
So that was the dumb email I got and I thought it was all special and stuff but then other people got the same email so I guess not.

02:32:57.420 --> 02:32:59.420
I mean, I'm not even talking about it.

02:32:59.420 --> 02:33:00.420
But yeah.

02:33:00.420 --> 02:33:02.420
No, just three of us supposed to say that.

02:33:02.420 --> 02:33:07.420
So, yeah. That's all. Pretty stupid.

02:33:09.420 --> 02:33:13.420
Spam sucks. Oh, that's what I was gonna give an FU2 this week and I forgot it alone.

02:33:13.420 --> 02:33:14.420
I got to see Robin Drag.

02:33:14.420 --> 02:33:17.420
Don't talk about that on this show.

02:33:17.420 --> 02:33:19.420
Alright, you can talk about it if you want.

02:33:19.420 --> 02:33:20.420
I got to see Robin Drag.

02:33:20.420 --> 02:33:21.420
Okay.

02:33:21.420 --> 02:33:22.420
It was cool.

02:33:22.420 --> 02:33:23.420
Two, two, one.

02:33:23.420 --> 02:33:24.420
I'm scarred for life.

02:33:24.420 --> 02:33:31.420
We have dead airspace!

02:33:54.420 --> 02:33:56.420
Uh-oh. Now it's tied.

02:33:58.420 --> 02:34:00.420
We need people to hurry up and send their votes.

02:34:00.420 --> 02:34:04.420
Jahi, I got your vote, so you don't have to send that over a message. I already got it.

02:34:04.420 --> 02:34:05.420
Alright.

02:34:05.420 --> 02:34:07.420
We need... we need...

02:34:07.420 --> 02:34:08.420
Irene!

02:34:08.420 --> 02:34:12.420
No, no, no, no. We gotta wait and see if there's any more votes coming in the chatroom.

02:34:12.420 --> 02:34:14.420
Because there's still some people in chatroom who haven't voted yet.

02:34:14.420 --> 02:34:16.420
Yeah, vote. Vote for me.

02:34:16.420 --> 02:34:17.420
So, it's...

02:34:17.420 --> 02:34:18.420
Oh, there's one.

02:34:18.420 --> 02:34:19.420
Oh, let's see.

02:34:19.420 --> 02:34:29.420
We'll give it ten seconds to get what we want in.

02:34:29.420 --> 02:34:32.420
Let's talk about something else.

02:34:32.420 --> 02:34:34.420
How cool Vincent D'Amore is.

02:34:34.420 --> 02:34:39.420
Vincent D'Amore is cool, but he doesn't swear in his songs.

02:34:39.420 --> 02:34:42.420
Do kids swear in Icelandic or something?

02:34:42.420 --> 02:34:44.420
He'd be cooler if he did.

02:34:44.420 --> 02:34:48.420
No, just because something has swearing in it doesn't make it cool.

02:34:48.420 --> 02:34:59.420
SoCal Kicks brings up a good thing we should talk about. I briefly mentioned this after the Milpitas Golf Land interviews, but we are going to be going to Cyberbeat Nation, Orange Lounge Radio. Well, at least I'm going.

02:34:59.420 --> 02:35:02.420
Fuck them, we're scheduling it on Valentine's Day.

02:35:02.420 --> 02:35:08.420
Yeah, you know what, since I'm the single one, Valentine's Day doesn't matter to me this year, so I'm going to go to L.A.

02:35:08.420 --> 02:35:10.420
This is my five year anniversary with Dan.

02:35:10.420 --> 02:35:12.420
Well congratulations you guys, that's really cute.

02:35:12.420 --> 02:35:14.420
Give us presents.

02:35:14.420 --> 02:35:31.420
Well, some other Bimani release, definitely release the second code for DVR Extreme, if anyone cares, you know, release the sync for Extreme, Twinbee, and also Burning the Floor Momo Mix, which has got the retarded speedup in the middle.

02:35:31.420 --> 02:35:34.420
That song would do very good in Trainee Mix 3.

02:35:36.420 --> 02:35:38.420
Unnecessary speedup.

02:35:39.420 --> 02:35:40.420
But, no.

02:35:40.420 --> 02:35:42.420
So yeah.

02:35:42.420 --> 02:35:45.420
That's all.

02:35:45.420 --> 02:35:48.420
Somebody else vote.

02:35:48.420 --> 02:35:50.420
Jenny Bean hasn't voted. Make her vote.

02:35:50.420 --> 02:35:52.420
Jenny Bean vote.

02:35:52.420 --> 02:35:54.420
Who else hasn't voted? No, Tyler hasn't voted.

02:35:54.420 --> 02:35:56.420
Vote for your fellow staff squad person.

02:35:56.420 --> 02:35:58.420
Who hasn't voted? Who am I going to single out here?

02:35:58.420 --> 02:36:00.420
Excel hasn't voted.

02:36:00.420 --> 02:36:01.420
Did Jahi vote?

02:36:01.420 --> 02:36:02.420
Jahi did vote.

02:36:02.420 --> 02:36:06.420
Did VidPower vote?

02:36:06.420 --> 02:36:08.420
No, there he did. He did.

02:36:08.420 --> 02:36:10.420
Oh, Slinky didn't vote.

02:36:10.420 --> 02:36:11.420
Slinky, vote for me.

02:36:11.420 --> 02:36:14.420
Alright, we're naming people now who haven't voted.

02:36:14.420 --> 02:36:15.420
So, alright.

02:36:15.420 --> 02:36:16.420
We're singling you out.

02:36:16.420 --> 02:36:18.420
Oh, okay. We got one from JB. Here we go.

02:36:20.420 --> 02:36:22.420
Oh, that wasn't a vote.

02:36:22.420 --> 02:36:23.420
JB, vote.

02:36:24.420 --> 02:36:25.420
JB, vote.

02:36:25.420 --> 02:36:26.420
It's all on your shoulders.

02:36:27.420 --> 02:36:29.420
Next vote is the final vote.

02:36:29.420 --> 02:36:30.420
Next vote is the final vote.

02:36:30.420 --> 02:36:34.420
And it's going to be the tiebreaker vote, possibly.

02:36:34.420 --> 02:36:41.420
the

02:36:42.860 --> 02:36:44.500
and

02:36:44.500 --> 02:36:46.020
jenny bb votes for

02:36:46.020 --> 02:36:47.500
attitude putting

02:36:47.500 --> 02:36:50.100
now i've got that

02:36:50.100 --> 02:36:52.900
jenny bb breaks the time

02:36:52.900 --> 02:36:55.340
matches over

02:36:55.340 --> 02:36:58.380
for the second week in a row

02:36:58.380 --> 02:36:59.500
it wins

02:36:59.500 --> 02:37:00.460
nice trying

02:37:00.460 --> 02:37:03.620
The OSFPB tried cloning himself to vote again.

02:37:03.620 --> 02:37:06.820
Nice tribe, you were five seconds too late, unfortunately, so...

02:37:06.820 --> 02:37:09.420
Eternity wins again in the second week.

02:37:09.420 --> 02:37:11.200
And uh...

02:37:11.200 --> 02:37:14.500
the Grimshaw one will just have to be saved for the occasional fuck-off show.

02:37:14.500 --> 02:37:16.100
Sorry, kids.

02:37:16.100 --> 02:37:18.940
But yes, I'll send that to you guys that wanted it after the show.

02:37:18.940 --> 02:37:21.560
Or you can visit Tal's website. He has it, but...

02:37:21.560 --> 02:37:26.120
Ask Tal when he comes back on the channel where his website is, because that's where he got it from.

02:37:26.120 --> 02:37:27.420
so the cage match is over

02:37:27.420 --> 02:37:30.620
eternity wins again

02:37:30.620 --> 02:37:32.620

Puppet Like A Muppet.

02:38:40.520 --> 02:38:42.520

Ah, such a busy schedule.

02:38:45.520 --> 02:38:46.520
Ooh.

02:38:46.520 --> 02:38:47.520
Ooh.

02:38:47.520 --> 02:38:48.520
Rock the cock.

02:38:48.520 --> 02:38:49.520
Rock the cock.

02:38:49.520 --> 02:38:52.520
Alright, we did the erotic thing like an hour ago. Moving on.

02:38:52.520 --> 02:38:56.520
You know that Candy Cane still makes me think of that Jay and Silent Bob comic?

02:38:56.520 --> 02:38:57.520
What? What one?

02:38:57.520 --> 02:39:03.520
The one where Dante went to see Caitlin in the asylum and started fucking her with the Candy Cane.

02:39:03.520 --> 02:39:05.520
And she woke up and chased him out.

02:39:06.520 --> 02:39:11.520
I need to watch the Clerks cartoon series again just because it rules so much.

02:39:11.520 --> 02:39:12.520
Is it safe?

02:39:13.520 --> 02:39:15.520
It's very safe.

02:39:16.520 --> 02:39:17.520
Has anybody seen any-

02:39:17.520 --> 02:39:23.400
Is it safe?

02:39:23.400 --> 02:39:26.400
Has there been any DDR on TV lately?

02:39:26.400 --> 02:39:27.400
Like on a show?

02:39:27.400 --> 02:39:28.400
No.

02:39:28.400 --> 02:39:31.280
Like I heard it was on Fastlane like three months ago but that's such old news.

02:39:31.280 --> 02:39:35.640
They're gonna be airing a Cyberbeat Nation commercial on TV.

02:39:35.640 --> 02:39:36.640
On TV?

02:39:36.640 --> 02:39:37.640
Yep.

02:39:37.640 --> 02:39:38.640
Where?

02:39:38.640 --> 02:39:39.640
You can go download it off of DDR.

02:39:39.640 --> 02:39:43.920
Yeah but it's a commercial but that doesn't mean it's a real commercial.

02:39:43.920 --> 02:39:46.640
It just seemed like a DDR ego thing.

02:39:46.640 --> 02:39:48.640
I thought that was just an online commercial, like it's just...

02:39:48.640 --> 02:39:49.640
Oh, really?

02:39:49.640 --> 02:39:50.640
Yeah.

02:39:50.640 --> 02:39:52.640
I don't think they're actually gonna air it, no.

02:39:52.640 --> 02:39:53.640
Where would they air it?

02:39:53.640 --> 02:39:54.640
Call me ass fucker.

02:39:54.640 --> 02:39:55.640
Ass fucker?

02:39:55.640 --> 02:40:00.140
Oh my god though, I did download a cool, I mean it's an old commercial, but it was like

02:40:00.140 --> 02:40:03.640
the one of this Nike shoe that they're wearing in Japan.

02:40:03.640 --> 02:40:04.640
No, Nike.

02:40:04.640 --> 02:40:09.140
It's this guy walking past a gigantic shoe in front of a billboard, and all of a sudden

02:40:09.140 --> 02:40:11.640
the shoe transforms into a robot and flies off.

02:40:11.640 --> 02:40:13.640
And the guys are standing there going, blink.

02:40:13.640 --> 02:40:18.200
link but they made a toy of that like 10 of them and they were giving them to

02:40:18.200 --> 02:40:23.360
executives and had one in a giveaway price I went with that was also in a

02:40:23.360 --> 02:40:30.400
magazine for spin magazine came with the little flip book it was pretty much the

02:40:30.400 --> 02:40:35.440
same thing like turn into like a Gundam that's what the football player look

02:40:35.440 --> 02:40:42.440
And he like jumped up and flew away from the other side of the fence going,

02:40:42.440 --> 02:40:45.440
Well, you know, shoot them and do a robot.

02:40:45.440 --> 02:40:51.440
You know, you know what, let's do a segment on this show that we usually do when we're stretching for things to talk about,

02:40:51.440 --> 02:40:52.440
because we have a lot of people here tonight.

02:40:52.440 --> 02:40:53.440
Ask Orange Lounge.

02:40:53.440 --> 02:40:55.440
Yes, you got it. We're going to do Ask Orange Lounge.

02:40:55.440 --> 02:40:57.440
Play Ussalakun.

02:40:57.440 --> 02:40:58.440
I do not have that, do you?

02:40:58.440 --> 02:40:59.440
I don't think I have that.

02:40:59.440 --> 02:41:00.440
I'll send it to you.

02:41:00.440 --> 02:41:03.440
We're going to do the usual Ask Orange Lounge music.

02:41:03.440 --> 02:41:04.440
No!

02:41:04.440 --> 02:41:08.440
Yeah, either you ask Orange Lounge or we play the fly.

02:41:08.440 --> 02:41:10.440
You have your choice.

02:41:10.440 --> 02:41:14.440
Why don't you fly in the background while you're waiting?

02:41:14.440 --> 02:41:15.440
I think it's in there still.

02:41:15.440 --> 02:41:16.440
Is it already in there? Alright.

02:41:16.440 --> 02:41:18.440
So send us those questions to me in the chat room.

02:41:18.440 --> 02:41:26.440
You can ask OrangeLounge or you can ask Zero, you can ask Jonas, or alternatively you can ask Brad and Irene out in the front room.

02:41:26.440 --> 02:41:27.440
You can ask any of us.

02:41:27.440 --> 02:41:28.440
Actually, I have a better song.

02:41:28.440 --> 02:41:30.440
Or Puppy or Ryan.

02:41:30.440 --> 02:41:31.440
The fly isn't that good.

02:41:31.440 --> 02:41:34.440
We can play I've Got Janeiro in there that's really good.

02:41:34.440 --> 02:41:38.440
That was going to be my cage match song, but nine minutes long.

02:41:38.440 --> 02:41:40.440
No, we're doing our During the Wonderland songs. That's what we always do.

02:41:40.440 --> 02:41:41.440
Alright, fine.

02:41:43.440 --> 02:41:45.440
Alright, so ask Orange Lounge. Send me those questions in the chatroom.

02:41:45.440 --> 02:41:47.440
We, we, we, we, we, we, we...

02:41:47.440 --> 02:41:49.440
You can ask Orange Lounge, or you can ask any of our guests.

02:41:49.440 --> 02:41:50.440
Here, you have to play it off of singing it again.

02:41:51.440 --> 02:41:52.440
Here we go.

02:41:53.440 --> 02:41:54.440
Rob, I'd like to ask you a question.

02:41:54.440 --> 02:41:55.440
Really?

02:41:55.440 --> 02:41:57.440
Why are you so fly?

02:41:57.440 --> 02:41:59.440
Why am I so fly?

02:41:59.440 --> 02:42:01.440
Why am I so sexy? Is that why you're asking me?

02:42:01.440 --> 02:42:04.440
No, I'm actually thinking of Peanut Flunky Colma Divas.

02:42:04.440 --> 02:42:05.440
Ask the guy why he's so fly.

02:42:05.440 --> 02:42:06.440
Alright, well let's...

02:42:06.440 --> 02:42:10.440
Why are you so fly for a white guy?

02:42:10.440 --> 02:42:12.440
My last name is white man.

02:42:12.440 --> 02:42:13.440
Okay, first question.

02:42:13.440 --> 02:42:17.440
And people, don't send me your questions over slash notice.

02:42:17.440 --> 02:42:20.440
It's got to come over slash MSG because I might miss them.

02:42:20.440 --> 02:42:22.440
But I caught this one so we'll start with this question.

02:42:22.440 --> 02:42:24.440
SoCalKicks wants to know,

02:42:24.440 --> 02:42:31.440
Can SoCalKicks be a special super duper derpity derp host at CBN?

02:42:31.440 --> 02:42:33.440
He can be our local chorus watcher.

02:42:33.440 --> 02:42:34.440
I don't see why not.

02:43:04.440 --> 02:43:09.440
It's still boring as ever.

02:43:09.440 --> 02:43:12.440
I heard you almost got run over by a cop.

02:43:12.440 --> 02:43:14.440
Yeah, they have cops.

02:43:14.440 --> 02:43:19.440
Yeah, it's all a conspiracy. They're trying to take me out.

02:43:19.440 --> 02:43:26.440
A couple days ago when I was going out late and I found the A&M to get food,

02:43:26.440 --> 02:43:29.440
because the damn dining halls close early,

02:43:29.440 --> 02:43:41.440
I was leaving on my bike and three cop cars come screeching into the gas station parking lot with no lights or sirens on, and one of them almost hit me.

02:43:41.440 --> 02:43:46.440
And yeah, things suck.

02:43:46.440 --> 02:43:50.440
Remember, it's the People's Republic of Davis where they'll find you for breathing.

02:43:50.440 --> 02:43:52.440
This is CBN.

02:43:52.440 --> 02:44:03.440
What I'm thinking, and I need to know what the other hosts think of this, instead of airing the interviews during a show, maybe have it be its own like special that airs like Friday night or something on the station.

02:44:03.440 --> 02:44:04.440
Sure, why not?

02:44:04.440 --> 02:44:10.440
Why not? I'm thinking of doing like a reality radio thing, like actually doing a journal, like saying hey it's Friday morning and we're leaving.

02:44:10.440 --> 02:44:14.440
Because I'm going down there with Mel B and he's always a colorful character to have on the show.

02:44:14.440 --> 02:44:21.440
Brad and Irene might possibly tag along, we all know Brad's funnier than hell and Irene will probably be playing Animal Crossing so she won't say anything anyway.

02:44:21.440 --> 02:44:25.440
I wish I could go, but I'm having an empty house the whole weekend.

02:44:25.440 --> 02:44:30.440
So yes, SoCalCakes, you can be some kind of special, super-duper correspondent there.

02:44:30.440 --> 02:44:35.440
And in the background, we'll have the Atari 5200 going.

02:44:35.440 --> 02:44:36.440
Alright.

02:44:36.440 --> 02:44:41.440
Um, definitely. But I have one of those too, and I do have combat.

02:44:41.440 --> 02:44:45.440
Alright, moving on. More questions.

02:44:45.440 --> 02:44:47.440
Um...

02:44:47.440 --> 02:44:48.440
How did you run through your...

02:44:48.440 --> 02:44:50.440
USFVB wants to know what?

02:44:50.440 --> 02:44:51.940
I haven't read through the list yet.

02:44:51.940 --> 02:44:52.940
What list?

02:44:52.940 --> 02:44:54.940
Video games, because I have no.

02:44:54.940 --> 02:44:56.940
We'll do that just before we finish the show, okay?

02:44:56.940 --> 02:44:57.440
Alright.

02:44:57.440 --> 02:45:00.940
EOSFB wants to know, when will Orange Lounge have the next match game?

02:45:00.940 --> 02:45:01.940
That's an excellent question.

02:45:01.940 --> 02:45:05.940
We were gonna do one tonight, but everything else ran too long,

02:45:05.940 --> 02:45:08.940
because we had the Milpitas interviews and the Fuck You's went on forever, so we're...

02:45:08.940 --> 02:45:10.940
We'll try and get to one next week, okay?

02:45:10.940 --> 02:45:11.940
We'll do one next week.

02:45:11.940 --> 02:45:12.940
We'll do one next week for you.

02:45:12.940 --> 02:45:13.940
We'll show.

02:45:13.940 --> 02:45:21.940
Snubdismoid wants to know, how would one go about passing rhythm and patty?

02:45:21.940 --> 02:45:25.940
Oh, is that an edit? Oh, that's the edit. Loki, tell us about this.

02:45:25.940 --> 02:45:33.940
Rhythm and patty, or R and patty, was Orange Beanie's third place winner, I believe.

02:45:33.940 --> 02:45:39.940
Third place for the hell edits. If you want to try passing it, play it the first stage, and play your first stage on beginner.

02:45:39.940 --> 02:45:42.940
You cannot fail Beginner, the first stage.

02:45:42.940 --> 02:45:45.940
So just play the edit and make sure it's set to Beginner mode.

02:45:45.940 --> 02:45:51.940
And you can try as many times as you want on the first stage and you can't fail it.

02:45:51.940 --> 02:45:56.940
But he did it and I was surprised. I was like, holy shit, he got an A on it or something.

02:45:56.940 --> 02:46:00.940
Yeah, so it's a lot of stamina, but that's about it.

02:46:00.940 --> 02:46:10.940
I'm still thankful for an era that was cooler because it followed the 2DX steps, well, whatever.

02:46:10.940 --> 02:46:15.940
And the rhythm. That'd be huge. I heard it and I was like, oh my god, it's 2DX.

02:46:15.940 --> 02:46:22.940
Well, what went it over the other ones was the crowd reaction for it because everyone was like, oh, that's so cool.

02:46:22.940 --> 02:46:25.940
Alright, moving on. Next question?

02:46:25.940 --> 02:46:29.440
Next question, this one comes from Jaheem, Jake and Attic, our buddy.

02:46:29.440 --> 02:46:32.940
Jake and Attic wants to know, when did Rob first get laid and how was it?

02:46:32.940 --> 02:46:35.940
Well, we do pass your virginity on the way to SoCal.

02:46:35.940 --> 02:46:41.940
For those that don't know, my virginity is actually two exits before Milpitas Golf Land.

02:46:41.940 --> 02:46:45.940
And this is really ironic. No, this is really ironic.

02:46:45.940 --> 02:46:49.940
I lost my virginity the same weekend I saw DDR for the first time.

02:46:49.940 --> 02:46:53.940
Like, many years ago. Like, it was 1.5 mix, like a long...

02:46:53.940 --> 02:46:54.940
Like, two.

02:46:54.940 --> 02:47:03.260
Yeah. So, uh, and how was it? Uh, sorry to say I've had much better since. So, you all

02:47:03.260 --> 02:47:08.060
can wave when you're past Mission Boulevard. There's a Motel 6 right there. Just wave at

02:47:08.060 --> 02:47:13.740
it. I can't believe I just said that on the radio. My mother's crying somewhere. Alright.

02:47:13.740 --> 02:47:21.940
Moving on. Jenny Bean. Can DCB&I be special non-Cyberbeat Nation interview hosts if we

02:47:21.940 --> 02:47:26.900
figure out how to record them for the people that don't know, that don't get to go to Cyberbeat

02:47:26.900 --> 02:47:32.500
Nation. Ha ha ha. Okay, sure, why not? Okay. Alright, you guys want to record something?

02:47:32.500 --> 02:47:38.500
I'm not going by choice because I have my 5 year anniversary and I'm going to get laid.

02:47:38.500 --> 02:47:44.380
Alright. Well I'm just going to get laid anyways. Yeah, gee, I wish I could be crammed into

02:47:44.380 --> 02:47:51.260
a nice small Korean arcade with tons of people there and it being all hot and stuff and crowded.

02:47:51.260 --> 02:47:58.940
Uh, wait, no, that was, no, sorry, don't want to go.

02:47:58.940 --> 02:48:04.020
All right, so, um, I wanted to go just to go to the Price is Right, goddammit, that's

02:48:04.020 --> 02:48:07.780
the only thing I don't, I don't think Mel and I are going to have time to go Price is

02:48:07.780 --> 02:48:11.780
So, we'll see.

02:48:11.780 --> 02:48:15.780
Uh, Jenny Bean, to answer your question, yes.

02:48:15.780 --> 02:48:19.780
You guys make something, we'll air it. For sure. We don't know when.

02:48:19.780 --> 02:48:23.780
If it'll be during the show or maybe like a post-Cyberbeat Nation special show or something.

02:48:23.780 --> 02:48:24.780
Yes, Brad.

02:48:24.780 --> 02:48:28.780
And news. Olivia has left bad-stinning on a Danville.

02:48:28.780 --> 02:48:31.780
We have our Olivia back!

02:48:31.780 --> 02:48:34.780
Yay! Olivia's gone! I'm so happy.

02:48:34.780 --> 02:48:42.540
We got Lee back. Yay! I'm so happy. Good, you can have the bitch.

02:48:42.540 --> 02:48:46.460
Alright, wow. Wow, happy day in Animal Crossing. Oh, happy day!

02:48:46.460 --> 02:48:49.660
You can have that little chick back. Alright, here we go. Moving on.

02:48:49.660 --> 02:48:52.740
Quit traveling between villagers. We're going to lose like all of our villagers.

02:48:52.740 --> 02:48:57.300
You guys keep doing the traveling. Alright, moving on. Shadow.

02:48:57.300 --> 02:49:00.740
Hey, Loki, can we make you into one of those Vert 2 thingies for StepMania?

02:49:00.740 --> 02:49:05.900
you and your burning hair jumping out for the left hand side of the screen

02:49:05.900 --> 02:49:10.840
well let me grow my hair a little bit longer.

02:49:10.840 --> 02:49:17.760
You can get me dressed up for like because in Phantom Man, I'm going to be cosplaying as Ulong the bunny.

02:49:19.880 --> 02:49:24.480
so you can get a picture of me with a pancake on my head, and uh, yeah that'd be fun.

02:49:24.480 --> 02:49:27.660
I would cosplay as Ulong too.

02:49:27.660 --> 02:49:30.660
Rob, do you mind if I cosplay with you?

02:49:30.660 --> 02:49:32.660
You alright, Ed?

02:49:32.660 --> 02:49:37.660
We're gonna cosplay as Ulan, and you know what? I found those old rabbit fur coats from the 80s.

02:49:37.660 --> 02:49:42.660
Since they're already dead and made into coats, we can just cut them up. That'd be cool.

02:49:42.660 --> 02:49:48.660
Oh my lord. Alright, StrongBrad wants to know, can we spot him for cyberbeatination?

02:49:48.660 --> 02:49:51.660
No. Alright. Moving on.

02:49:51.660 --> 02:49:53.660
Sorry, you know.

02:49:53.660 --> 02:49:54.660
What?

02:49:54.660 --> 02:49:58.160
enough. It's hard enough for me to get down there, Christ.

02:49:58.160 --> 02:50:02.160
Vidpowah wants to know, how are your guys' PlayStation 2s modded, if they are modded

02:50:02.160 --> 02:50:05.760
at all? Also, if they are modded, did you do it yourself, or did someone else do it

02:50:05.760 --> 02:50:06.760
for you?

02:50:06.760 --> 02:50:09.480
Sierra, I'm not cheap. I bought a JPS2.

02:50:09.480 --> 02:50:11.040
I also bought a JPS2.

02:50:11.040 --> 02:50:17.920
I attempted to mod mine with a plug mod that's internal, and ever since I tried doing that,

02:50:17.920 --> 02:50:24.600
every now and then it doesn't want to reload my GameShark CD, but I have three plug mods

02:50:24.600 --> 02:50:31.600
that are supposedly going to work in some version of the PS2, I just don't have one.

02:50:32.000 --> 02:50:36.320
The money you're going to spend attempting all those various mod chips, you might as

02:50:36.320 --> 02:50:41.840
well just crack and get the JPS tool. Keep in mind this, is that for every mod that

02:50:41.840 --> 02:50:46.960
comes out, with every new game that comes out, it has the protection. So like, say that

02:50:46.960 --> 02:50:51.680
you want the next 2DX to come out, it ain't going to work. Just, you know, save yourself

02:50:51.680 --> 02:50:58.680
You can get a Japanese PlayStation 2 for cheap, and from what I understand, if anything ever happens to a network video to service secret JPS2s.

02:50:58.680 --> 02:51:04.680
Word of advice, don't use modtips on your PS2s because it's exactly what Jamie said.

02:51:04.680 --> 02:51:07.680
If you do, I'll laugh at you.

02:51:07.680 --> 02:51:15.680
So, you know, maybe there'll be a super special secret one that'll get through someday, but honestly, just get the JPS2 and save yourself the headache.

02:51:15.680 --> 02:51:18.680
You're gonna have one that works for everything after the system's already obsolete.

02:51:18.680 --> 02:51:21.240
make uh... moving on technically

02:51:21.240 --> 02:51:25.320
moving on the u.s. at bb old your body's giving us a website asking us the

02:51:25.320 --> 02:51:28.600
impressions of the site

02:51:28.600 --> 02:51:32.440
and i'm really scared of every else at bb sent me a

02:51:32.440 --> 02:51:33.960
all right

02:51:33.960 --> 02:51:36.940
comma sutra animated

02:51:36.940 --> 02:51:38.160
you know that

02:51:38.160 --> 02:51:40.320
i will uh...

02:51:40.320 --> 02:51:43.560
interesting will look at it more definitely later we got a bunch more

02:51:43.560 --> 02:51:47.120
questions to get to and i think i like the animated picture of the

02:51:47.120 --> 02:51:51.600
the right in the cock there, that's very interesting. That might be my new icon on TDR Freak, what

02:51:51.600 --> 02:51:55.200
do you think? Oh wait, I might get a point for that.

02:51:55.200 --> 02:51:58.160
It'd get removed, you'd have 24 hours to remove it.

02:51:58.160 --> 02:52:04.200
Damn it. Well for that 24 hours it would be hilarious, alright. Moving on. 23rd Magus,

02:52:04.200 --> 02:52:09.720
can we call you a boo-boo kitty fuck? If you were asking that question to Loki, sure.

02:52:09.720 --> 02:52:14.560
Actually, that's my backup name for when I, my name was taken or something. That's what

02:52:14.560 --> 02:52:15.560
it appears at.

02:52:15.560 --> 02:52:20.560
Who is someone in the Fruits community's nickname? Is it Booboo Kittyfug? The Leginal community?

02:52:20.560 --> 02:52:23.560
Yeah, I remember seeing a name called Booboo Kittyfug.

02:52:23.560 --> 02:52:24.560
Alright.

02:52:24.560 --> 02:52:28.560
DCB has a question and it's, hi guys!

02:52:28.560 --> 02:52:30.560
Hi!

02:52:30.560 --> 02:52:33.560
This is the police.

02:52:33.560 --> 02:52:38.560
DCB, put the joke down. Step away from the joke.

02:52:38.560 --> 02:52:41.560
Hi dad, I'm in jail.

02:52:41.560 --> 02:52:43.560
Alright, moving on.

02:52:43.560 --> 02:52:47.060
SoCalKicks wants to know, will you buy me a PlayStation 2 Japanese?

02:52:47.060 --> 02:52:47.560
No.

02:52:47.560 --> 02:52:48.060
No.

02:52:48.060 --> 02:52:50.060
Moving on.

02:52:50.060 --> 02:52:54.060
Damn it, the Matrix is 102 days away, it's 102 days too long.

02:52:54.060 --> 02:52:57.060
Alright, uh, Jake Kinetic wants to know,

02:52:57.060 --> 02:53:01.560
Does anyone know where I can get Japanese hip-hop and R&B romanji lyrics?

02:53:01.560 --> 02:53:06.060
Where is the Lucifer pick the Dark Sacra was supposed to send me, and who's hotter?

02:53:06.060 --> 02:53:09.060
Yoji Kudo or Irvine Kinesis?

02:53:09.060 --> 02:53:11.060
I fucked that up because I'm too honky, sorry.

02:53:11.060 --> 02:53:20.060
Alright, here's what I have to say. As far as the lyrics, I had stuff, but I'll have to go find the sites again.

02:53:20.060 --> 02:53:29.060
As far as the pic of Lucifer, my hard drive was broken a few weeks ago, so that means that I have to find it for you again.

02:53:29.060 --> 02:53:34.060
But just look up Angel's sanctuary. There's actually a really good Japanese set. They've got tons of good Lucifer pictures.

02:53:34.060 --> 02:53:37.060
And as far as Yoji or Irvine... Irvine, dude!

02:53:37.060 --> 02:53:42.060
It's the hair, the trench coat, the shotgun, the hat...

02:53:42.060 --> 02:53:45.060
The only redeeming quality of playing Final Fantasy VIII.

02:53:45.060 --> 02:53:49.060
Yeah, I agree. Irvine's hotter because that was the only redeeming quality of Final Fantasy VIII.

02:53:49.060 --> 02:53:53.060
And Squall was pretty happy because I had the personality of that pancake.

02:53:53.060 --> 02:53:56.060
Squall was a pansy, okay.

02:53:56.060 --> 02:54:01.060
Oh, DCB claims that I love Derby Owners Club more than I love... us.

02:54:01.060 --> 02:54:05.060
The Meaning Orange Lounge, I suppose, or more than the Killer Pals or something like that.

02:54:05.060 --> 02:54:10.060
Um, to be truthful, uh, yes, I do love Derby Owners Club more than any of you. Sorry!

02:54:10.060 --> 02:54:12.060
It's just the way it is. No, I'm kidding!

02:54:12.060 --> 02:54:13.060
Next question!

02:54:13.060 --> 02:54:16.060
It's just a game. Sure, I spent 20 bucks on it the other day, but hey, you know.

02:54:16.060 --> 02:54:22.060
Why can't they have Hookers Owners Club, okay? I want to be a pimp and be able to raise my hookers and be the best prostitutes in the world.

02:54:22.060 --> 02:54:23.060
Why can't they have that?

02:54:23.060 --> 02:54:26.060
Uh, I could totally see that if it were just Golf Lounge.

02:54:26.060 --> 02:54:53.060
My favorite role would have to be at this point the twin dragon role at Tsuchiya, which is

02:54:53.060 --> 02:54:59.460
There's like six types of fish wrapped around, of course, the rice, the nori, and fried lobster

02:54:59.460 --> 02:55:03.960
tail with this really yummy sauce, like, you know, without mustard.

02:55:03.960 --> 02:55:09.760
And then my favorite nigiri roll is, at this time, I would have to say a todo, which is

02:55:09.760 --> 02:55:11.880
a patty tuna.

02:55:11.880 --> 02:55:13.880
I like toast.

02:55:13.880 --> 02:55:17.160
No, I don't like sushi at all.

02:55:17.160 --> 02:55:20.960
I've never tried it, but, you know, me being a picky eater, I don't like sushi.

02:55:20.960 --> 02:55:23.960
It doesn't look okay to you. Sorry to hear that.

02:55:23.960 --> 02:55:27.960
Alright, we're going to take the last few questions here.

02:55:27.960 --> 02:55:33.960
Oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. My favorite role is Sacramento roles, deep fried California roles, because they're fattening and good.

02:55:33.960 --> 02:55:35.960
What's your favorite single role?

02:55:35.960 --> 02:55:36.960
Favorite single role?

02:55:36.960 --> 02:55:38.960
Have you had any before, like unagi, taco?

02:55:38.960 --> 02:55:39.960
Like the sashimi?

02:55:39.960 --> 02:55:42.960
No, that's not sashimi, that's the spaghetti sashimi.

02:55:42.960 --> 02:55:45.960
Um, I'd say unagi.

02:55:45.960 --> 02:55:47.960
Rob likes the eel.

02:55:47.960 --> 02:55:48.960
I do like the eel.

02:55:48.960 --> 02:55:49.960
It's long.

02:55:49.960 --> 02:55:53.960
Alright, we're closing the question asking now. We're going to take the last few questions here.

02:55:58.960 --> 02:56:00.960
Oop, dead air. Sorry about that.

02:56:00.960 --> 02:56:01.960
This music is making me want to kill myself.

02:56:01.960 --> 02:56:04.960
Alright, last question. God damn it, it's another will you buy me question.

02:56:04.960 --> 02:56:08.960
RYC3 wants to know, will you buy me a universal PS2?

02:56:08.960 --> 02:56:09.960
No, there's no such thing.

02:56:09.960 --> 02:56:11.960
No, there's no such thing. Alright.

02:56:12.960 --> 02:56:13.960
That's it.

02:56:13.960 --> 02:56:20.960
the

02:56:22.000 --> 02:56:24.640
uh... columbia the shuttle tragedy

02:56:24.640 --> 02:56:29.600
it's a screen cap cn and it's a shuttle traveling nearly eighteen times speed of

02:56:29.600 --> 02:56:31.600
flight

02:56:31.600 --> 02:56:35.640

02:56:49.240 --> 02:56:50.000

02:56:50.000 --> 02:56:54.200
do the salt pepper shakers on these clues actually hold cocaine and heroin

02:56:54.200 --> 02:56:57.200
total inside over friday yes

02:56:57.200 --> 02:56:59.000
but

02:56:59.000 --> 02:57:01.120
i don't want to see the exit

02:57:01.120 --> 02:57:03.040
a little bit

02:57:03.040 --> 02:57:06.680
doctor to us no good place to pick up girls

02:57:06.680 --> 02:57:10.240
online online

02:57:10.240 --> 02:57:13.880
and last quite a lot of as we may say there are no girls under all forty-year

02:57:13.880 --> 02:57:14.800
old man

02:57:14.800 --> 02:57:18.740
last question so-called kick snow do you think alley larder would be a good

02:57:18.740 --> 02:57:21.400
samus for the metro movie

02:57:21.400 --> 02:57:23.160
that should final destination

02:57:23.160 --> 02:57:25.480
still in place a lot of that i don't want

02:57:25.480 --> 02:57:28.160
uh... what i think your final destination

02:57:28.160 --> 02:57:33.080
who she had brought on those who have been on with other movie was here

02:57:33.080 --> 02:57:34.080
There was another big...

02:57:34.080 --> 02:57:36.080
Rob, I watched movies that don't suck.

02:57:36.080 --> 02:57:38.080
I don't want to say she wasn't that bad.

02:57:40.080 --> 02:57:41.080
What else was she in?

02:57:42.080 --> 02:57:43.080
Would she be a good Samus?

02:57:43.080 --> 02:57:44.080
Eh, she'd be okay.

02:57:44.080 --> 02:57:48.080
It would be better than fucking Angelina Jolie or Mira...

02:57:48.080 --> 02:57:49.080
Just fucking...

02:57:50.080 --> 02:57:51.080
We'd be...

02:57:51.080 --> 02:57:52.080
We'd be away with those people.

02:57:54.080 --> 02:57:55.080
Oh, thank you!

02:57:55.080 --> 02:57:57.080
Okay, Ally Larter wasn't Jay and Silent Bob.

02:57:57.080 --> 02:57:59.080
She was the chick that farted.

02:57:59.080 --> 02:58:00.080
Oh!

02:58:00.080 --> 02:58:01.080
She...

02:58:01.080 --> 02:58:03.080
No, nope, she's too...

02:58:04.080 --> 02:58:06.080
You know who... They need...

02:58:08.080 --> 02:58:11.080
No, no, no. First of all, Samus has green hair.

02:58:12.080 --> 02:58:14.080
They're gonna be making a Metroid movie, yes.

02:58:14.080 --> 02:58:16.080
They need to make... Samus needs to be...

02:58:16.080 --> 02:58:17.080
I weep for the future.

02:58:17.080 --> 02:58:19.080
A freaking powerful-looking woman.

02:58:19.080 --> 02:58:22.080
Because Samus is supposed to be, like, seven feet tall. She's... China.

02:58:22.080 --> 02:58:23.080
I'm wondering why...

02:58:23.080 --> 02:58:26.080
Dude, China would be a fucking kick-ass Samus.

02:58:28.080 --> 02:58:30.080
Uh, loosely lawless. No, um...

02:58:30.080 --> 02:58:32.080
Or the chick that played Gabrielle.

02:58:33.080 --> 02:58:36.080
I want my Samus to have lesbian connotations, Dammit.

02:58:37.080 --> 02:58:42.080
I was wondering why... I mean, I've seen a lot of really shitty ass movies.

02:58:42.080 --> 02:58:45.080
I mean, for instance, I've given out some of those for the Varsity Boys.

02:58:45.080 --> 02:58:49.080
Really? Black Ninja? Okay. Really shitty ass movies.

02:58:49.080 --> 02:58:51.080
Why hasn't the D.D.R. movie come out?

02:58:51.080 --> 02:58:55.080
I mean, even some really cheap ass studio could pick this stuff up for next to nothing.

02:58:55.080 --> 02:59:02.080
and nothing. I'm just surprised that it hasn't been, like, released.

02:59:06.200 --> 02:59:09.800
I'm still voting for Lucy Lawless with a kick-ass.

02:59:09.800 --> 02:59:13.200
Yeah, Lucy Lawless with a kick-ass.

02:59:13.200 --> 02:59:16.800
And SoCalKicks is stomping and pouting because he said he saw the end of

02:59:16.800 --> 02:59:18.320
Metroid Prime and she's a blonde.

02:59:18.320 --> 02:59:23.680
Um, actually, so is Super Metroid, but I'm referring to the first Metroid. If you put in the code

02:59:23.680 --> 02:59:27.680
Justin Bailey. Samus has green hair.

02:59:27.680 --> 02:59:31.680
And you know Justin Bailey is not actually a name.

02:59:31.680 --> 02:59:35.680
It's actually referring to just wearing underwear.

02:59:35.680 --> 02:59:39.680
It's an Australian thing. Because Bailey is a beast.

02:59:39.680 --> 02:59:43.680
So that's where it came from. Justin Bailey.

02:59:43.680 --> 02:59:47.680
Yes, I'm full of old video game knowledge. Sue me.

02:59:47.680 --> 02:59:51.680
I have to go through my list, but no one cares.

02:59:51.680 --> 02:59:52.680
I'll go through the list.

02:59:52.680 --> 02:59:53.680
Do it.

02:59:53.680 --> 02:59:54.680
It would take me a long time.

02:59:54.680 --> 02:59:55.680
You want to save it for next week then?

02:59:55.680 --> 02:59:56.680
Um, I'll go through the list.

02:59:56.680 --> 02:59:57.680
Who wants to know what I have?

02:59:57.680 --> 02:59:58.680
Do it.

02:59:58.680 --> 02:59:59.680
Okay.

02:59:59.680 --> 03:00:00.680
I do not have Jaguar.

03:00:00.680 --> 03:00:04.680
Okay, starting with the Nintendo products, I have a Virtual Boy.

03:00:04.680 --> 03:00:07.680

03:00:33.480 --> 03:00:43.240
master systems. I have two power based converters. I have a couple of genesys. Genesys? Genesys?

I have a Nomad, I have a Game Gear, and then I have Saturn, I have two Saturns, and we

03:00:52.680 --> 03:00:59.680
have the battery pack and AC plug. I have an Atari Lynx, I have a 2600, new style, the

03:01:00.760 --> 03:01:07.760
kind that's more comfy. We got it for five bucks. Anyway, oh no, I have a Sega CD and

03:01:07.760 --> 03:01:14.760
a Sega CD and a Sega CDX. No. Actually I might, I might have a night drive. Um, as

03:01:14.760 --> 03:01:20.760
far as, ok, for Atari I have 2600, 250200s, I have the 4 port and the 2 port 5200s. Um,

03:01:20.760 --> 03:01:26.760
I have the Lynx, I have Cliccovision, I have the expansion module 1 and 2, so I can play

03:01:26.760 --> 03:01:33.760
Turbo. Um, I have an Intellivision. I do, I have a Turbo Duo. Um, think about Turbo

03:02:03.760 --> 03:02:09.760
I've got a stack of old style PlayStations, including the first model.

03:02:09.760 --> 03:02:11.760
I have a PS1.

03:02:11.760 --> 03:02:13.760
I have, what else did you name?

03:02:13.760 --> 03:02:15.760
I have an Xbox.

03:02:15.760 --> 03:02:17.760
Um, I have...

03:02:17.760 --> 03:02:22.760
I do not have 3DO, but we almost bought a CDI right before Game Masters went out of business.

03:02:22.760 --> 03:02:24.760
Um...

03:02:24.760 --> 03:02:26.760
I have a Connectrix.

03:02:26.760 --> 03:02:28.760
We're looking for a Vectrex.

03:02:28.760 --> 03:02:31.760
Um, Mattel? What did Mattel do?

03:02:34.760 --> 03:02:36.760
I almost bought a Pico.

03:02:36.760 --> 03:02:37.760
I thought that was an Intelli-

03:02:37.760 --> 03:02:38.760
The Sega Pico?

03:02:38.760 --> 03:02:41.760
Because they were selling it for ten bucks and I was a mobile.

03:02:43.760 --> 03:02:46.760
Um, I have a Neo Geo cartridge system.

03:02:46.760 --> 03:02:48.760
I have a Neo Geo CD.

03:02:49.760 --> 03:02:55.760
Do you know how Dan got that? Dan got our Neo card by trading a Sega CD for it.

03:02:55.760 --> 03:03:04.760
Back then they didn't know, and we actually are still picking up our cartridge plus, we picked up the COF2000.

03:03:04.760 --> 03:03:06.760
How much was that?

03:03:06.760 --> 03:03:10.760
We got it for just over 300.

03:03:10.760 --> 03:03:12.760
What else do I have?

03:03:12.760 --> 03:03:14.760
Oh yeah, I have a Wonderswan color.

03:03:14.760 --> 03:03:18.760
We have two Neo Geo Pocket colors in the Neo Geo Pocket.

03:03:18.760 --> 03:03:24.760
And I might have exhausted the list if there's anything else I don't remember because I know I've got other stuff.

03:03:24.760 --> 03:03:25.760
Okay.

03:03:25.760 --> 03:03:26.760
So.

03:03:26.760 --> 03:03:27.760
Wow.

03:03:27.760 --> 03:03:28.760
You own a lot.

03:03:28.760 --> 03:03:29.760
That's like forty-something, I think.

03:03:29.760 --> 03:03:30.760
Disgusting.

03:03:30.760 --> 03:03:31.760
Oh well.

03:03:31.760 --> 03:03:32.760
But fun.

03:03:32.760 --> 03:03:33.760
Your house is a video game museum.

03:03:33.760 --> 03:03:34.760
It really is.

03:03:34.760 --> 03:03:40.760
And don't forget the Transformers and Valkyries that are littering my house.

03:03:40.760 --> 03:03:42.760
You can come over to my house.

03:03:42.760 --> 03:03:43.760
Seriously.

03:03:43.760 --> 03:03:45.760
I'm afraid because the movie pile that I have in my house is starting to creep towards my

03:03:45.760 --> 03:03:47.760
bed and I think it's coming after me.

03:03:47.760 --> 03:03:48.760
Yikes.

03:03:48.760 --> 03:03:49.760
Okay, we gotta wrap this show.

03:03:49.760 --> 03:03:51.440
We're already running like five minutes late.

03:03:51.440 --> 03:03:52.880
Any final thoughts from you folks?

03:03:52.880 --> 03:03:53.880
I want Boba.

03:03:53.880 --> 03:04:02.880
I need to finish my website.

03:04:02.880 --> 03:04:07.880
Zero, any final thoughts? Thanks for being here tonight.

03:04:07.880 --> 03:04:10.880
No problem. I'd come back whenever you wanted.

03:04:10.880 --> 03:04:13.880
I don't know. I would say if I was Willy Wonka, I would be really rich.

03:04:13.880 --> 03:04:18.880
And for the Stiffle and Ollie fans, they'll know what I mean by get the fat kid out of my chocolate milk.

03:04:18.880 --> 03:04:20.880
And that's it.

03:04:20.880 --> 03:04:23.880
Rock, Jonas, any final thoughts?

03:04:23.880 --> 03:04:26.880
Well, not much. I haven't spoken as usual as much.

03:04:26.880 --> 03:04:30.880
But, um, I'll be back next week again.

03:04:30.880 --> 03:04:31.880
Cool.

03:04:31.880 --> 03:04:33.880
This time probably on time.

03:04:33.880 --> 03:04:36.880
You can play match game next week.

03:04:36.880 --> 03:04:38.880
Oh, sure.

03:04:38.880 --> 03:04:43.880
Alright, be ready at five o'clock or so, maybe.

03:04:43.880 --> 03:04:44.880
Yeah, they can't hear your little exchanger.

03:04:44.880 --> 03:04:45.880
No, that was just dead air. What did you say?

03:04:45.880 --> 03:04:46.880
Yeah, dead air. Anyway.

03:04:46.880 --> 03:04:49.880
I said I'm going to come back with them because I'll be ready at five o'clock because I wouldn't have.
