162138	164758	I'm going to go ahead and just say, screw the intros.
164798	165838	We'll get it done afterwards.
165898	167139	So we'll go ahead and go to break.

600401	606523	Now hey, if you're a broke ass like I am, why don't you come to the one place that costs absolutely nothing to go to and still the fun is just as great.
606863	608743	It's Orange Lounge Radio, Sunday nights.
609324	613745	Kick it with me and you just might realize the best things in life are free.
615265	615825	We're back.
616266	616826	We're live.
617766	620927	And people are still playing Animal Crossing, but that's okay.
622191	622771	Animal Crack.
623252	625093	We have one of our special guests up here, though.
625193	625653	Say hi.
626574	627254	Yo, what's up?
627274	630075	This is Jay Kinetic, representing Step Spot in the Bay Area.
630196	630956	How you doing, Jamie?
632217	634118	I'm on my way to intoxication.
634498	634958	I see this.
635278	637820	You're already a glass ahead of me.
638786	640648	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
658564	659765	There's a microphone in my face.
660045	660405	Shit.
662827	663968	Yeah, Sky Vodka.
664128	666770	I'll take phrases that Mariah Carey's gotten used to for 500.
667010	669052	Ah, there's a microphone in my face!
670433	671113	That was wrong.
672974	673855	And how are you doing tonight?
675256	680880	I was doing good until I ate something, and that something happened to be McDonald's, and then McDonald's is ripping me up.
682101	684603	What you want is what you vomit at McDonald's today.
686218	690936	Yes, then McDonald's is going to need a PR campaign to undo all the damage you just did.
692352	704038	Well, actually, yesterday I wasn't feeling too good either, or the day before, because I made this spaghetti with this really cool sauce I got off the internet, like this recipe off of Robert and Don, the radio show I listen to every morning.
704638	713563	And it was really good, but the thing is, it calls for two full bulbs of garlic ground up, along with a large red onion.
713583	720627	So you have pretty much like this, half of it is onion and garlic, and then the rest is all tomatoes and stuff, and it's really good.
721407	727751	The problem is, when you have that much garlic, you just eat a little bit of it and it makes your stomach really, really gassy.
728951	729672	Well, actually, no.
729692	733774	The problem is you'll need about three bottles of Listerine after you eat two bulbs of garlic and a red onion.
733934	737256	I mean, God, you could probably breathe on somebody and it's probably, like, toxic.
739177	740977	Yeah, so it was really good.
741638	745960	It just felt like you eat just a little bit of it and you feel, like, full already.
746160	747081	And it's weird.
747101	747801	It's the weirdest feeling.
747821	748601	You just feel full.
749102	749422	I don't know.
750683	753425	Now the worst time I had was when I prepared some spaghetti.
753445	762991	I was cooking for my ex at the time and she'd come over and I was cooking and I threw something that wasn't tobacco into the spaghetti sauce along with some alcohol.
764481	766543	I didn't feel the effects for the first 30 minutes.
766583	770927	I sat down to use my computer after she went home, and all of a sudden that hit me like Viking and I was out.
771027	772288	It was scary.
772789	773409	Oh, there's Shermie.
773890	774771	If you look very slowly.
774911	776032	Oh, she just went back under the thing.
776392	779695	Shermie decided to peek out and say hi to everybody, but then she went back under the bed.
781317	782258	Oh, poor baby.
784680	786022	So what's the topic tonight anyway?
786621	787041	The topic?
787581	789082	The topic is, Rob ain't here!
789302	790022	Party time!
791242	794043	Yeah, he decided to go down to that Cyber Beat Nation thing.
794583	795384	You know, huh?
798024	799645	Melody said like there's never a topic on the show.
799705	800705	Come up here, Melody!
802846	804987	Yeah, we have our models in here tonight, DarkSakura.
805007	805887	Melody's on her way up.
805947	808748	She's having a hard time getting up the stairs because Animal Crack is calling her.
808768	809368	Say hi, Melody.
810149	812650	No, I'm having a hard time coming up the stairs because I'm half drunk.
813150	814211	That's the reason why.
815011	816192	Lightweight.
816972	818092	Lightweight.
818433	820553	Yes, I'm a lightweight and I'm damn proud of it, okay?
820593	821814	That means I'm a cheap date.
823435	825996	Ooh, shouts out to Mel down at Cyber Beat Nation.
826036	830638	I heard Tigger, did Tigger take first in a... Okay, we're going to announce that.
830658	831478	Sorry, I didn't want to ruin it.
831960	836242	We're going to go ahead and... Yeah, what's this topic?
836322	836542	Yeah.
837823	840464	We're going to go ahead and announce the winners of Cyber Beat Nation.
841665	843766	We'll start with 2DX.
844946	846467	In third place, we have DJ Hobba.
847087	848288	In second place, Ferrari.
848908	850469	In first place, Ryan2DX.
852149	853610	PA winners for DDR.
853690	856512	Third place, Bimaniac from Canada.
857552	860053	Second place, we have... Thank you.
860073	861554	Shouts to Canada, though.
861914	862834	Much love to Canada, though.
862874	864555	Y'all got good women.
864575	865855	Um, second place, JS Blade.
865895	866695	No, no, no.
866956	867796	No, they have good laws.
869056	871037	No, Canada, props to Canada for having good laws.
873878	874698	Um, say hi.
875018	875598	Hello, people.
876698	878959	Um, and in first place, for PA, we have Tigger.
879839	881620	Like we're surprised!
882859	883600	Oh, my God!
883840	884701	Oh, heart attack!
884741	885582	Tigger won PA!
885782	886723	Oh, God, it hurts!
887223	887343	Ah!
887784	889205	Oh, fuck, I'm dying!
889325	891587	I was just still pretty thrilled that Rob beat Rhea at Fremont.
891908	892909	Yeah, true, true, true.
892949	895491	Respect to Tigger, though, because that's one of the coolest PA-ers I've met.
895511	896772	He never got an ego about this shit.
896792	897333	Shouts to him.
897813	898093	Okay.
898914	899555	Freestyle.
900396	903739	It was a total NorCal showing, except for, like, one person.
904740	907642	In fourth place, our very own Step Squad boy, Wendell.
907863	908183	Book, book!
909561	912482	and third place we have AJ of, um, RTF.
914882	918623	Second place, I think I got this right because I could barely hear Rob when he told me Master 42.
919284	920664	If I have that wrong, I'll correct it.
921164	922885	And in first place, Bruce Leroy.
925385	930206	So, he won a Max 2 machine, which means everyone's gonna go hang out at his house.
932107	934468	Um, so that was a...
937071	942453	That's a pretty good showing there for NorCal, so... Fuck NorCal, fuck you!
942693	946175	Fuck NorCal, fuck you!
946935	951777	No, no, no, no, we have to be nice to our out-of-state people because... You said it first!
951957	954899	Keep in mind, I lived in Alabama where we had no bimani.
954919	956839	When I went there to visit in April, you know what they had?
957540	958800	A Korean Dance Maniacs.
959861	960541	Oh my god!
961381	962542	Down in Newark...
963450	970373	Down at Newark, in New Park Mall, I think Ross was with me when I played this, uh, they have Dance Maniacs, in Korean!
971453	972593	Dance Freaks, in Korean!
972813	976715	I've never played this game before and I was amazed by this, I'm like, they have Korean songs on this?
977015	979796	Didn't they have, uh, uh, Kleon, Funky Tonight or something?
981437	982397	They had another Klon song.
984588	989872	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1007727	1012170	But no, I found out that they recently got a Beatmania, an actual Beatmania machine.
1013271	1020936	Just in the hallway at the mall outside the movie theater that the mall I used to work at, which actually, if what I understand correctly, is actually where my arcade used to be.
1021176	1022337	But they moved the arcade further down.
1023658	1024979	Yeah, and Latin's Castle.
1026100	1028202	I worked for Namco at one time.
1029002	1031844	I worked at Cyberzone.
1033505	1034006	Cyberstation.
1035439	1042944	Oh yeah, this show of ours has been brought to you by Islander's Crooked Eye Special Brew, a unique malt beverage with natural flavors.
1043364	1045545	That's code word for it gets you fucked up.
1047887	1048907	He wouldn't let me buy the Schlitz.
1049267	1050448	He just wouldn't let me buy the Schlitz.
1050468	1051329	I wanted the Schlitz.
1052145	1054947	I wanted to shlitz, I wanted to represent- IT'S SHLITZ!
1055007	1055427	I'LL KILL YOU!
1055447	1056387	No, you know what you need?
1056548	1058589	What you need is an ice-cold Colt 45.
1058829	1062911	You know, if we didn't have that, I would've, I would've, but he would've let me!
1063071	1064932	Somewhere Billy Dee Williams is having a cry.
1065372	1066673	I know, I know he is.
1067994	1069875	You're being awfully- He's just so smooth.
1070355	1071376	You're being awfully quiet.
1073057	1074638	Yeah, that's because I feel like a blimp.
1075738	1076739	I feel fat.
1079563	1080444	and Sassy.
1090128	1092909	The chat room is like, what the hell is wrong with these people?
1096111	1105435	I don't know if any of you are old enough to remember this, but late night TV did show the 40 ounce liquor alcohol, they do one for Colt 45, with Billy Dee Williams at a party.
1107712	1108994	Cult 45, Red Dog, Urban Beers, Water and Piss
1125592	1127934	You know, when I lived in, I lived in the hood at one time.
1130595	1131736	Del Paso Heights.
1134418	1138441	I mean, you could tell at one time, maybe back in the 50s, it was a nice neighborhood.
1138521	1146246	But the place was all like, you know, the houses were, there were some, you know, hood houses and dogs running down the street.
1146306	1148787	People would go down with their loud bass while I'm trying to sleep at 4 in the morning.
1149488	1154771	And on New Year's Eve, our friend Tina, we call her Beanie, she came over.
1155972	1160737	While we were having our big anime marathon, we were watching Cowboy Bebop.
1161778	1165903	And we were playing Samba de Amigo and she brought me a 40 ounce Corona.
1167156	1173939	and said, but I felt inclined to go drink it on my couch, but I didn't have chairs or a couch.
1174819	1176299	So, yeah.
1177460	1178340	That's the sad thing.
1178480	1179701	I mean, I'm from the slums.
1180181	1183162	I originally spent like half of my existence in Oakland, California.
1183562	1190665	And what's sad about Oakland is that there are three things that you will find in most neighborhoods, and that's a liquor store, a nail shop,
1192063	1193425	and like a church.
1194065	1197509	You'll find those all within a block proximity of each other.
1197529	1199251	There are five churches by my house in DPH.
1200106	1201948	You don't need five churches in one neighborhood.
1201988	1202728	That's scary.
1203209	1207212	But we saw this, and they'd all be selling the most crappy beers on the planet.
1207252	1210835	We're talking like Natural Ice and like Schlitz and like Red Dog.
1211236	1214718	You name it, and it's a ghetto beer that you probably saw an advertisement for in the source.
1214779	1217521	They had it, and it was just bad, and you knew it was a rig up.
1217921	1219062	But you couldn't do anything about it.
1219402	1224146	So I guess the idea was you drank your Mad Dog 2020 and went to church because that was the only way you could put up with the people there.
1224166	1224607	I'm not sure.
1225871	1227311	Well, you know what?
1227511	1230072	It's funny that we're talking about alcohol on a Ben Monte show.
1230192	1230732	Yeah!
1231453	1232833	Have you ever tried to play DDR Drunk?
1235134	1240915	I'm happy to say that I got a ton of perfects while I was off of four TGI Fridays drinks, despite the fact that they were weak.
1241295	1248938	I was not drunk enough yet, so I went to the store, got two pints of Sapporo beer, good stuff, went up to the DDR machine and was scoring B's and A's all day.
1248958	1250398	It's all about Drunk Drunk Revolution.
1251124	1254385	First night I met Wendell at Faname of 2001.
1255525	1258925	He proceeded to beat Afronova Maniac while drunk.
1260686	1262426	And I don't think he's been able to do it sober, right?
1263706	1264566	That was awesome.
1265566	1266427	I'm not quite sure.
1267147	1273448	I would DDR naked with the right person, but you'd have to have a private machine, because I don't want my wang flapping around.
1273968	1275888	We don't have upskirt can, thank you very much.
1275928	1277108	I have played DDR in my pajamas.
1278549	1280869	If you're a woman playing DDR without a bra, it's painful.
1282674	1283875	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1300991	1303274	Actually, there's quite a bit going on.
1304355	1314747	New Stepmania, our new CVS update for February 12th CVS snapshot for that.
1314847	1318651	They're really making it sort of like, it's becoming more of...
1319592	1321935	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1336711	1337391	It's really cool.
1338091	1343093	They also have added Marvelouses and a whole bunch of new modifiers on there now.
1343133	1347574	They have one that's called Land, which is just like in the Oni Course trick.
1349054	1352555	It's kind of a reverse boost where it slows way down.
1352935	1360296	They have one called Expand, where it kind of just expands and contracts as it goes up the screen.
1360477	1361237	And then they've got...
1362657	1363458	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1381613	1383335	I'm still working on my website.
1383375	1391966	I'm taking my time though because I'm going to be adding CD titles to everything and just making sure it's fully done that way.
1392066	1395610	I have a full set of DDR Extreme sim files that will be coming up.
1397513	1399134	Everything that's released so far, of course.
1399975	1402597	And then, let's see what else.
1403558	1404779	I don't know, a whole bunch of shit.
1406100	1409503	Oh, DWI Insanity, they just released A.U.
1410464	1413747	Trance 2, a non-stop DWI.
1414267	1415529	It's 35 minutes long.
1416970	1417851	I played it last night.
1419212	1423476	After about 20 minutes, your hand just... It doesn't hurt anymore, but...
1423996	1424897	Yeah, that was pretty fun.
1425097	1432887	And then, let's see, other than that, BomaniSell switched to a new server thanks to kind donations from the community.
1433127	1436271	And so they should be bringing up more sim files on that site, too.
1436731	1438974	Probably see the rest of DDR Extreme stuff come up.
1439314	1441116	And same with DDR UK.
1441156	1443839	They've just re-put up all their new stuff on new...
1444560	1448161	We should also make a mention about our contest.
1466776	1470979	Our old TV themed DWI contest.
1471039	1477603	We don't really have a due date yet, but it's going to be done to any old TV theme.
1478483	1479204	Only TV themes.
1479504	1481825	Or were we doing just TV themes?
1481845	1483626	Yeah, so old TV themes DWI.
1483827	1484507	No remixes.
1485087	1486008	Original TV themes.
1487392	1488873	I want to see some of those TV themes.
1488913	1490955	I want to see, like, Greatest American Hero.
1491115	1492496	I want to see Silver Spoons.
1493077	1494098	I want to see the A-Team.
1494218	1496600	If somebody did one to Small Wonder, that'd be crazy.
1498181	1500543	I looked for the Small Wonder theme to play on the pre-show, and I couldn't find it.
1502425	1506969	I've only got one TV theme that's actually into a DWI, and that's Nash Bridges' theme.
1508970	1509991	You know what one would be fun?
1510071	1511612	I just thought of Bonanza.
1512313	1512834	Banana!
1517601	1519163	I AM A BANANA!
1520424	1522646	My food is too big!
1522686	1525688	You're watching a family emergency.
1526869	1528591	Uh... Yeah!
1529031	1530452	My guy... Airwolf!
1530853	1531233	Yes!
1532154	1533675	No, no, I just had it.
1533755	1535436	The Price is Right would be a good one.
1536297	1539960	Um, the other one that I wanted to see... God, it was just in my brain.
1540221	1541922	The years of marijuana have fucked me up.
1542683	1542743	Um...
1543911	1544991	Batman would be pretty cool.
1545051	1545652	Batman would be cool.
1545672	1547172	They're throwing him out in the chat room now.
1547432	1548573	We got the chat room up here live.
1548953	1551054	If you had already joined the chat room, what server are they on?
1553675	1558076	It's otherside.irc.net.
1558116	1565139	Just go to orangelounge.skie.cx and there's a link there to our channel.
1566160	1572582	If you want one that's kind of a related TV hip-hop theme to New York undercover, kick-ass intro music, use that.
1574706	1578308	WKRP MASH
1606170	1624255	Baby, if you've ever wondered, wondered whatever became of me I'm living on the air in Cincinnati, Cincinnati, WKRP Got kinda tired of packing and unpacking, town to town, up and down the dial
1637178	1647661	And that's enough of that.
1648981	1651102	Yes, the WKRP in Cincinnati theme.
1652422	1652782	You know what?
1652982	1655723	I was, I don't know how old I was when that show was on.
1655803	1657423	It was like, there's Shermie.
1658244	1659244	Oh, she's back under bed.
1660171	1662634	Jeremy decided there were too many people downstairs and came up here.
1663835	1665177	Saved by the fucking bell.
1665817	1670503	You know, what's-her-face-from-that-show went on to be in Showgirls and show her boobs and her ass to the world.
1671444	1672285	Elizabeth Berkley.
1672958	1674679	Well, so did Tiffany Amber Thiessen.
1676019	1677340	She's stupid, though.
1677360	1680562	I don't know, a bunch of crap.
1680582	1681782	She was on Beverly Hills 90210.
1682883	1684664	I'm sure she got naked at some point.
1685664	1686084	I know.
1687125	1687585	I'm sure.
1688585	1689366	She's a slut.
1690486	1690746	Yeah.
1691627	1693928	So if you were on Saved by the Bell, then you'd have to turn into a hoe.
1694248	1695949	You know Kim Fields was in a Bell Biff DeVoe video?
1699022	1699623	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1718059	1719340	And she's a slut in that one, too.
1719600	1729486	I mean, she's willing to, like, have sex with, or she, you know, and you can tell that the character, it went through her mind that, you know, she was going to have sex with this, like, 16-year-old kid.
1730247	1732908	So, you know, she was a slut in that, too.
1733028	1734329	So, I don't know.
1734790	1735370	But she sucked.
1737291	1738892	Elizabeth, uh, Berkley.
1739352	1741774	She's played everything she's been, she's been like a slut.
1742659	1750784	Dude, okay, now, I admit she was hot back in the day on Saved by the Bell, okay, long way, you know, she was alright looking, even though she was, I don't know if she was brown or blonde back then, she was okay.
1751465	1755267	The thing that turned me off to Elizabeth Berkley was the pool scene in Showgirl.
1755327	1760451	Some of you remember this, I swear to God the woman was having a seizure because the light went bad in the freaking pool.
1760951	1762833	What the hell happened?
1763053	1766275	I've had, you know, I've been in bed a little bit.
1766295	1769198	I have not seen anybody have an orgasm like that.
1769238	1772580	If you have an orgasm like that, put a message out in the chat room.
1772781	1773902	That was scary.
1774022	1775403	I was afraid she was having a heart attack.
1775463	1776323	I don't know what the hell happened.
1777364	1781828	She looked like a fucking shark grabbed onto his nuts, like, just thrashing in the water.
1782548	1783329	I don't know, it was weird.
1784390	1786692	Oh my god, what the hell's going on?
1786972	1788193	What the hell was wrong with her?
1788914	1789314	God!
1790492	1792736	You fucked him without fucking him!
1793437	1793878	Okay.
1794318	1796362	You kind of have to fuck them in order to fuck them.
1796903	1798766	But if you weren't fucking them, how were you fucking them?
1801550	1802932	Last week on Orange Lounge Radio.
1805542	1806883	That whole movie is awful.
1807744	1809765	Every time I've watched it, I've fallen asleep.
1810586	1812087	Actually, scarier scene.
1812287	1813188	I just saw this movie.
1813768	1817611	I was watching it over at... Whose house was I just over at the other day, watching this?
1818111	1818512	Tony's.
1818652	1819432	My good friend Tony.
1819993	1821474	Kuno126, what's up to him?
1822275	1824016	Techie guy, represents Otaku Outpost.
1824396	1827438	We saw this movie, Yi Tu Mama Tamien.
1827518	1828239	Okay, you've seen this!
1828919	1830801	Okay, there's a scene in the movie!
1830821	1830901	Okay!
1831607	1833049	Two guys who are pretty close friends, right?
1833349	1835451	The movie gets wackier, so I still suggest you go out and see it.
1836973	1840657	One of their parents, okay, one of the kids is kind of rich, the other one's kind of poor, but this will get down.
1840677	1842199	I think the other kind of poor kid's middle class.
1842259	1843860	Anyway, they're at a country club.
1844361	1845082	You know this scene.
1845322	1846123	They're at a country club.
1847064	1851589	They're on two opposite diving boards talking while they're, you know, fapping.
1852907	1855548	And it gets scarier because they go to a shot.
1855588	1859249	It's bad enough that you see them fapping on the two diving boards at this country club in public.
1859769	1863570	But the killer scene is when you see the spooge hit the water.
1864430	1865891	They put this scene in the movie.
1866311	1866751	Why?
1867051	1868831	I didn't want to see the spooge hit the water.
1869952	1870992	That's just not cool.
1872512	1873973	You're tuned in to KTMI.
1874713	1875753	Too much information radio.
1877254	1879694	Well, there was also the other scene where they started making out, too.
1879714	1882135	The two guys started making out when they were with the one chick.
1882714	1883435	I want that movie.
1883655	1884715	I like seeing guys make out.
1885056	1886236	I mean, you're saying?
1888018	1890459	I don't have a single problem with guys making out.
1890479	1895703	If a guy's cute enough, I'd probably make out with him, but... Okay, two guys making out, that's one thing.
1896163	1902187	But at that point in the movie, we didn't need to see, you know, they pretty much had it established they were pretty homophobic.
1902488	1904649	We did not need to see the spooge hit the water.
1906991	1907971	Melody's in here now.
1908032	1908572	Say hi, Melody.
1909858	1912920	And she just paused because she just came in as I said that, and now she's kind of shook.
1915921	1923185	Perhaps we should get back to 2DX and Beatmania and everything, right?
1923746	1927288	I'm just having the image, that's mental image that I did not need.
1927928	1928148	Here.
1929689	1931750	I saw the whole movie, I just got bored with it too.
1931770	1932891	I was like, ah, it's foreign.
1934913	1935173	Oh, man.
1955336	1956618	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1972610	1975291	We haven't had out anything besides Eurobeat songs on DDR.
1975312	1977953	I'm still waiting to find a machine that has the club mixes on it.
1978913	1982215	And, you know, I'd really like for them to open up the code to that, although I don't think they will.
1982275	1984356	It'd be kind of cool if I could make my own DDR mix.
1985716	1987897	There's tons of songs on there, but hey, you know, that's why.
1988017	1993160	But I'm glad that there's nothing going on, because nothing going on means people are playing rather than starting drama, and that's a beautiful thing.
1993460	1996061	Because that means that there's less stupid people that I have to slap.
1997302	1999703	Actually, we're in the process of finding the code right now.
2000259	2002420	We have people working on it night and day.
2003721	2004961	Yeah, doing that kind of thing.
2005021	2008443	Actually, I'm getting closer and closer to being able to rip more stuff out of there.
2008463	2013025	I just got a thing to rip videos out of PlayStation 2 Bomani games.
2013045	2017667	The problem is the program is Japanese, so I have no fucking clue what it wants me to do.
2018907	2019888	Is this a fuck you show?
2021148	2022269	No, this is a real show.
2023158	2024458	Oh, darn.
2024478	2025519	We're going to do the Fikus later.
2025979	2029260	Okay, I'll save it for then because I don't want to mess up anything.
2029960	2032261	DarkSakura was cruising a really cool place.com.
2032281	2034462	My boy Government went to that.
2034822	2040184	I met him shortly after the destruction at MGL thanks to Changeo, Phoenix, and a bunch of other crazy MFs.
2040864	2043185	So go to that site, bmox.com, if you haven't already went there.
2043205	2044445	Actually, I think Phoenix is doing...
2045277	2069651	information gathering and news for them now too, really cool guy down in LA what's up to him and JustJay, Envision, other heads down there, Supply, Jobson, whatever the hell he is well it looks like, as far as new stuff coming out it looks like Guitar Freak's 9th and Drum Mania 8th are supposed to be coming out next month you're going to have Beat Mania 7th and the final coming out to Playstation 2
2070894	2073779	So is that Beatmania 7th the final mix for Beatmania?
2073820	2076424	So I'm assuming that everything is going to be stepped up to 2DX after that?
2078454	2081615	Um, yeah, it's pretty much, it's the final and, um, segment.
2081995	2083255	Hello, I totally forgot.
2083736	2087217	Another, um, DDR Extreme code was released this week.
2087937	2091578	Um, unlocking a couple more non-stop courses and more Oni courses.
2092058	2099220	Including in those, um, Oni courses, they've got, you know, Sakura as one of the playable songs in one of the Oni courses.
2099600	2102521	Along with, um, let's see what else, Xenon is in one of them.
2103181	2105804	and Dance Dance Revolution is in one of them.
2106124	2110568	And finally, in one of the non-subcourses, Heaven is... What was it?
2112109	2112389	Yeah.
2113030	2116293	Heaven is 57 gray or... I forget the fucking song.
2117882	2123466	Honestly, if you are looking, I don't know how many heads haven't wanted to play it.
2123606	2126728	If you haven't had a chance to play it yet, please go out and play Guitar Freaks.
2126788	2128949	It's an excellent game, and I feel it's kind of been slept on.
2128969	2138335	There are a few people, you know, most people don't go beyond DDR and I'd say Beatmania, but if you have to expand to another element, definitely go with Guitar Freaks.
2138395	2139996	It's one of the most fun games I've had.
2140316	2141777	Dance Mania X is another fun one.
2141817	2145159	Islander just mentioned that, but Guitar Freaks is one of my favorites.
2145699	2158563	And then later, earlier this week, I got to play more Cusar, because that was fun.
2160744	2161144	Same place?
2162345	2163145	Yeah, same place.
2163265	2165246	Played on the fifth mix in Max 2 again.
2165586	2167286	That fifth mix is fucked up.
2168107	2168567	Oh my god.
2169327	2170768	It's just, all the pads don't work.
2171408	2171748	That's it.
2172890	2180332	Nothing sucks more than when you go to an arcade and you've already dealt with somebody who's been talking to a gang of shit, and you can't kick their ass because the machine sucks.
2182833	2183133	Yeah.
2183633	2184033	What's that?
2187794	2188034	Yay.
2188415	2188675	Okay.
2189435	2195096	Again, guys, I'm really sorry, and thank you so much for bearing with me on this.
2195217	2196777	I'm going to go ahead and get... Oh, here, you talk.
2197981	2199082	Don't bear with us.
2199663	2202045	You're privileged to be listening to us.
2202826	2206810	You will deal with any hardships that you... Yeah.
2207611	2207951	Yeah.
2208452	2208892	Give me that.
2209273	2210734	Okay, I'm going to a break.
2355913	2359645	You're a New York City boy, so young, so wild, in a New York City

2834156	2835958	Listen to Orange Lounge Radio.
2836138	2838661	Because Bongo demands it.
2841324	2842185	Yay, we're back.
2843106	2845548	I'm on drink number four, which is more of that chocolate.
2846669	2849372	It's vanilla soy milk and Godiva liqueur.
2849853	2850593	How is it, Melody?
2852756	2853957	It's gone now.
2854077	2854978	I already drank it.
2855058	2856520	It's really yummy, actually.
2857438	2873466	I'm about to work on that drink myself, I'm working through a mixture of apple juice and sky vodka right now, so it's good, it's good stuff, I already had two with amp in it, so I'm getting kind of, oh wait, she's sampling the drink now, I'm getting kind of bent, we just came from a terrific, what was the name of the sushi spot we went to?
2875827	2878348	Dang, that is good, that's a really yummy drink.
2879989	2880449	Ross!
2882611	2883011	Fuck!
2883171	2885372	Alright, we don't know, no, the other one.
2887415	2912915	Toonari, if you're ever in Sacramento, go to Toonari Sushi, good stuff Right by DarkSakura's house, you can come be on Orange Lounge Radio too, if you're cool Um, we're all drinking except for our designated host Yeah, I'm staying sober, so I can be boring I gotta, you know, I have to be the dull end of the show Loki, I mean, are you straight or anything, Loki?
2912935	2914216	Do you drink normally or what's going on?
2915117	2915978	No, I don't drink normally
2917344	2918344	Any particular reason?
2919865	2922465	Because I think I'll probably get violent and hurt people.
2924145	2925406	Yeah, that's cool.
2925586	2926466	Angry drunks suck.
2926506	2927306	I've only experienced two.
2927326	2928766	Don't come around me if you're an angry drunk.
2929687	2933127	What we need to do is get you entirely shit-faced and take you to Golf Land.
2935528	2936188	Well, actually, no.
2936208	2938329	We don't want to get him shit-faced and take him to a strip bar.
2938389	2939289	Yeah, Golf Land would be good.
2940349	2942689	So he can murder all the silly, stupid Roosevelt children.
2944270	2945170	Get video of that.
2947072	2948973	I would pay money to see that.
2952315	2953696	Yes, Mongo Child does rock.
2954757	2958199	Melody and I have had Mongo Child two days in a row at the same place in Roseville.
2959099	2960260	At Great Wall in Roseville.
2960600	2962582	Hi, hi, say hi.
2963302	2963622	Hi.
2964443	2965443	This is Iguana Girl.
2965463	2966584	Oh my god, wee!
2967364	2968525	She's been playing Animal Crack.
2972007	2974849	She's another one of our designated people.
2977319	2998475	because the rest of us are well on our way I can stop playing the game as soon as I pay off another 500,000 bells I'm waiting for the first report in the news from Animal Crossing that somebody ran into somebody on accident or had a speeding violation because they were waiting to get home to do something in Animal Crossing
2999491	3008338	Well, I have actually seen spots on the road that are like potholes or whatever that look like the little star in Animal Crossing, and the first thing that crossed my mind was, I need to get my shovel and dig it up.
3009418	3011320	There's a serious addiction problem here.
3011340	3013802	We're trying to get Melody and Jessica into a 12-step.
3014542	3017224	We're working on that, but we haven't managed to do it today.
3019145	3019466	You see?
3021716	3037451	Now, I almost, you know, I used to be like, no, I actually never really was like that, but, you know, sure, I'd want to get back, you know, so I could do shit on Animal Crossing, but that was until I learned about the wonders of turning back the internal clock, into which case you could play days before and that kind of fun stuff.
3038372	3044238	I'm on the LiveJournal Animal Crossing community, and one person will actually refer to that as clock fondling.
3045059	3046020	Greatest term ever.
3047464	3049066	See, here's my problem with Animal Crossing.
3049346	3051128	There's not enough violence in the damn game.
3051448	3053030	For example, Tom Nook.
3053150	3056473	That son of a bitch needs to get a bullet right between the eyes for how rude he is.
3056774	3057795	I'm sick of that shit.
3058175	3064201	Every time I've seen somebody go to that goddamn store, that asshole sits there, okay, oh, you want to come into my store?
3064721	3069186	You need to be able to snatch him from behind the counter and beat his ass in that game for being an asshole.
3069566	3070127	Sick of this.
3071548	3074650	He's like a little Chinese woman that's running the store.
3075251	3075431	Oh!
3076492	3076652	Oh!
3076832	3077653	You want product?
3077713	3078333	You want product?
3078713	3082116	And then you go upstairs and there's like two and it's like, oh my god!
3082136	3083297	He spit two!
3085038	3085979	Okay, that was dirty.
3086579	3087319	That was dirty.
3087760	3088640	But that's the truth, man.
3088660	3089481	You need a punch button.
3089501	3095345	See, if it was GTA 3 Vice City, somebody pisses you off, you pull a shotgun out and fucking erase their ass.
3095365	3098387	In Animal Crossing, you gotta run around because it's one of those happy Nintendo games.
3098748	3099268	Screw this!
3099508	3100009	I want Animal...
3100970	3102110	You just hit them with a bug net.
3102190	3102871	There you go.
3102931	3106472	I wanna have an Animal Crossing where you can just hit somebody in the head with a fucking bat.
3107172	3109572	Animal Crossing 3, the carnage begins.
3109832	3110653	That's what I want.
3110693	3112073	Nintendo, make the game.
3114574	3116134	Okay, Jessica didn't wanna say anything.
3116434	3118855	But I say more violence in Animal Crossing.
3119135	3119835	That's what I want.
3119915	3121556	I want shovels to the back of the head.
3121936	3122896	I want hatchets.
3123176	3124056	I want meat cleavers.
3124076	3124777	That's what I want.
3125397	3126077	I have to pee.
3127711	3134378	No, what I don't understand is, okay, the store carries four types of paper, and no Nintendo games.
3134658	3135899	What the hell is up with that?
3136420	3137260	See, that's some other shit.
3137300	3140243	Fuck that game because it doesn't have all the best Nintendo games of all time.
3140544	3143466	Where's my goddamn copy of River City Ransom and Animal Crossing?
3143506	3146770	Yeah, it's not Nintendo proprietary, but I don't give a fuck.
3146990	3147951	That game was the shit.
3150323	3152285	I just want to hit someone's upside the head with a shovel.
3152406	3153047	That's right.
3153607	3154168	That's right.
3154208	3154649	That's right.
3154669	3156872	Hear the ping noise of a toddler's head in the Robin's store.
3157172	3158034	Fuck that bastard.
3159594	3165438	That and those stupid twins, and they sell like the stupidest shit, I mean like the, what was it, floating asteroid?
3165739	3168020	What the hell do I need a floating asteroid for my house for?
3168601	3170302	Plus, you know who else I'm gonna bust the cap in?
3170542	3174525	I'm gonna personally stab in the eye at stupid bitch Phyllis at the motherfucking post office.
3174886	3177127	I don't give a fuck if you're a postal worker, you rude bitch.
3177387	3182331	I'll come in there and strangle you at night, and then dance on your fucking corpse like Marishnikov, you dumb bitch.
3182611	3184253	Every single time I'm gonna fucking go see...
3184953	3191875	Every single time a motherfucker goes in there, another customer, FUCK YOU, YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO DO YOUR GODDAMN JOB, YOU STUPID BITCH, DIE!
3193276	3194836	Rose doesn't want the goddamn mic.
3196197	3197617	I'm too busy laughing.
3198918	3200158	I'll stab that bitch in the eye.
3201716	3202096	What was it?
3202256	3202537	Okay.
3203537	3203958	I saw this.
3204118	3205719	There's one animal in our town, Lucy.
3205779	3207780	She has the backyard theme in her house.
3208340	3209001	What the fuck?
3209241	3211302	Why make your house look like your backyard?
3211883	3212723	That's the dumbest thing.
3212923	3214064	I want to live in my backyard.
3214724	3215945	Because you're a fucking retard.
3216245	3216746	Another thing.
3217006	3220988	Iguana Girl, perfectly peaceful player, was going around today doing errands around people.
3221309	3222429	What was the name of that dumb bitch?
3223390	3224751	Start with a P. Ears.
3225856	3226236	Pippi!
3226676	3228197	That dumb bitch needs to die, too!
3228437	3230518	She went up to her and just asked a simple question, do you have any jobs?
3230758	3234279	Well, no, I actually don't, and I'm gonna take some of your shit, because you can't do anything about it!
3235159	3235460	No!
3235680	3237280	Hit her in the head with a fucking shovel!
3237760	3238501	I want debt!
3239901	3246744	Now, back on the entire theme of weird houses, I don't remember who it is, but someone has a freaking bathroom.
3247084	3251625	There's a bunch of exotic screens and toilets behind them all, and a plant and a garbage can.
3251705	3252986	It's a freaking bathroom!
3253346	3254667	That's what I want in my house.
3255087	3256367	Make it a public toilet.
3257128	3258088	Greatest room ever.
3258748	3262110	Because the greatest thing you can have in your house in Animal Crossing is a porta potty.
3263910	3265451	You know, we're missing The Simpsons.
3265871	3267152	The 300th episode.
3269653	3270093	No cable.
3271129	3281491	If you want the bathroom theme in your house, by the way, all you need is six toilets, the exotic screen, the exotic wall, the plaza tile, the trash can, and I think a cone.
3282172	3283572	And a plant.
3283712	3285672	And sadly enough, I remember what each of the items are.
3286673	3292714	Because I really want to relive the experience of going to San Francisco and trying to find a public bathroom to use after getting drunk, you know?
3293294	3296555	Nothing sticks out to me like trying to walk over the feces on the floor.
3297355	3300336	And, you know, I really want that public bathroom theme in there.
3300356	3300656	What the heck?
3302376	3303377	Ross is still done.
3304457	3305858	I don't have a fireplace, by the way.
3309180	3310301	He's holding Charmander.
3310701	3311482	Char!
3311802	3312442	Char!
3313143	3320467	Speaking of Pokemon, by the way, I'm going to be playing something for everybody.
3321248	3322068	Hold on for a second.
3322108	3323449	Josh, talk to everybody for a minute.
3324130	3324850	What do you want me to do?
3326311	3329312	Okay, um, okay, well, hey.
3329972	3331813	What was, they thought it was funny, I think.
3331853	3333654	I wonder if everybody in the chat room thought it was funny.
3334254	3334634	I don't know.
3334954	3338676	Uh, regardless, uh, DarkSakura's loading up a sea of goodness for you guys.
3338916	3339616	Ross is chilling here.
3339636	3341117	We're throwing around a Charmander.
3341397	3343458	Squirrel's personally my favorite Pokemon, even though I don't like it.
3344718	3347379	Okay, Charmander was molesting Melody's boob.
3348020	3351441	Mel's gonna have to beat the Charmanders, and now the Charmander's giving Ross head.
3353786	3358009	It's working it like Mariah Carey trying to go for a second record contract at Sony right now.
3359751	3364534	Speaking of Pokemon, I've been collecting a CD series called Pada Pada Max.
3365955	3367556	This is the Japanese Pokemon theme.
3368297	3370098	It ain't the Easter Bunny, motherfucker!
3370739	3372660	From the Pada Pada Max 3 CD.
3373381	3376043	So enjoy the Eurobeat Pokemon groove.
3377384	3379265	Animal Crossing Mookie Bar my ass.
3379966	3380106	Okay.
3482699	3483500	Oops!
3483600	3483840	My bad!
3483960	3484000	Um...
3512583	3514745	Yeah, we have our Eurobeat hater in here.
3516966	3517867	Yay, it's over!
3518007	3519368	It's Pokemon and Eurobeat.
3519408	3520189	It's like evil.
3521770	3522150	I don't know.
3523491	3525093	I was able to ignore the whole song.
3525473	3526073	That was great.
3528856	3529876	Yay, Digimon.
3531317	3539364	Worst remix ever has to be the, uh, that, what was it, uh, uh, AM, what was it?
3540794	3541074	A.M.
3541154	3542415	Groove 2001.
3542756	3544597	Holy shit, awful remix.
3545258	3545758	Awful remix.
3545778	3549321	Probably just like that Legend of Max 300 Unlimited crap.
3549741	3551703	Oh, no, Legend of Max Unlimited 300.
3552844	3555566	Stupid friggin' sim file.
3556127	3558989	In fact, you can't even download it because the URL is broken.
3561371	3563753	As soon as my CD is friggin' recognized, there we go.
3563773	3563813	Um...
3567600	3573068	Yeah, I'm gonna play something that if you've seen any of the Japanese Digimon, you'll recognize.
3573289	3574150	It's a short track.
3574871	3575692	So, here you go.
3577575	3578156	Um, eventually.
3590293	3592355	Lalalala lalalala lalalala
3634444	3636026	Thank you for watching.
3636046	3637127	See you next time.
3661138	3663301	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
3697711	3699111	There, was that better than Pokemon?
3699631	3700191	Yay!
3700652	3702592	I think we're gonna, we should go to our fav- Pokemon!
3703172	3703552	Thank you.
3704012	3707653	I think we should go to our favorite part of the show, the fuckies of the week!
3708033	3709313	Yay!
3709473	3712434	Yay!
3713254	3714194	The fuckies of the week.
3714634	3716415	Here, I usually explain to you, it's your turn.
3718375	3719835	This is where we get ranty.
3720415	3722976	Oh wait, this is just another part of the show.
3723726	3733412	This is where every week we take time to do a shout out to all those people that piss us off and all the things that inconvenience us because we're better than everyone else.
3735574	3736154	That's about it.
3737975	3752425	So, because, again, I can't play music in the background, we're going to go to a brief break so all of you can PM me, yes, private message, or you can email orangechallengeradio at yahoo.com and tell us about what pisses you off.
3753078	3762063	If you want to say fuck you to somebody, but you're too much of a wuss to do it yourself, tell us, and we'll say it for you, because we don't give a fuck.
3762403	3773910	We're just going to go ahead and play some of our usual fuck you theme songs, and then we'll come back and be angsty.
3774270	3774671	So, yeah.
3960073	3960626	Thanks for watching!
4061109	4065791	Well, that was our music for Fuck You's of the Week.
4066131	4070773	We'll go ahead and start with Loki for our angstiness.
4088900	4091301	Alright, I'm so thrown off without music.
4093702	4094002	No.
4095722	4096342	Oh, God.
4096363	4106986	Uh, no, see, um, I really only have, I don't have, I think I had FUs earlier this week, but, like, I've just been bored over the weekend, so I kind of forgot it.
4107286	4108587	Anyways, I have two.
4109227	4111027	Um, start off with LessAnxiety1.
4111347	4115629	Um, FU to Acid3.0 for constantly crashing on me.
4116649	4121751	and at least I'm smart enough to save every now and then, but the thing keeps freezing up on me and that sucks.
4122391	4123732	So, yeah, F you to that.
4123972	4129674	And, uh, F you to freaking stupid old people with the handicap license plates, okay?
4129714	4140218	Just because you're fucking crippled because you got shot in the ass in Vietnam or whatever, you don't need to be driving 30 miles an hour slower than everyone else and you take up the closed parking spaces and you walk slow and you suck.
4142566	4150552	So, you know, I think what should actually happen is, because, you know, a lot of these people with handicapped bumper stickers, you know, I see, they're not hobbling enough.
4150933	4158619	I just want to take, you know, their fucking wheelchair and just like, you know, go over the back of their spine with it, you know, just, you know, make sure that they're crippled just enough.
4158999	4164683	Because, what the hell, okay, if you're really crippled and you're driving a car, that's like driving a car blind.
4164884	4166685	I mean, I don't know.
4167666	4171729	I hate old people and I hate them with the stupid, yeah, stickers.
4172634	4175956	I don't like the people who are not handicapped and have handicapped stickers.
4177356	4181538	Who just have them, or like borrow some family members just so they can get a front parking spot.
4182839	4183359	That would work.
4183879	4186020	Anyway, is that your fuck you's of the week?
4186040	4186260	Okay.
4189201	4190522	Ah shit, they passed it to me.
4191403	4196429	Alright, first of all, fuck you to everybody who's involved in like the mainstream hip-hop community right now.
4196750	4201635	I'm sick of all you bastards who put out a fucking song and then put it out six months later as a goddamn remix.
4201715	4204779	I don't care if Mariah Carey's singing on it, it sucks dick anyway.
4205099	4211467	You fooboo-clad, stereotypical motherfuckers can almost suck my motherfucking, I'll battle you for your fucking title, dick.
4211827	4224791	I'm sick of all this shit, you motherfuckers talk shit all over MTV, every five minutes, will not freestyle, battle anybody worth a shit, and I'll go on record and say this, 50 Cent sounds like Mike Tyson with Down Syndrome, but he's supposed to be the hot sack out there?
4225171	4225731	Fuck you!
4226091	4238535	All these motherfuckers in the underground who've tried year after year after year to get put on, can't get put on because all of you fucking cock-sucking bastards up at MTV won't put on anything except for Real World and anything that'll get a fucking fashion brand out there.
4238835	4240375	Fuck all you fascist bitches.
4240655	4247337	Fuck all the goddamn stupid ass students at my fucking school who will not listen to me when they're in class and sit in the back of the class and don't do shit.
4247637	4250257	I'm sitting there, I give you 13 pages of notes to pass the test.
4250557	4251758	You can't even read that shit.
4251798	4255358	Learn something besides all the members of B2K, you stupid motherfuckers.
4255798	4264180	Fuck the president of North Korea because this dumbass shouldn't be building nuclear weapons when he can't spell blockbuster even though he has a fucking collection the size of a small state.
4264820	4267664	Um, motherfucker, everybody in Oakland is fucking stereotypical.
4267945	4273532	Motherfuck all the wannabe gangbangers in Fremont and Haywood who don't have anything better to do than try to be wannabe gangbangers.
4274153	4276717	Um, I don't know about everything out there, but I'll figure out some shit.
4276797	4277938	Fuck all y'all motherfuckers.
4281102	4281763	Say that again.
4282572	4290982	There was a line that I heard from, it was from Clone High, it's all, he's talking to like the dark organization or whatever, like these people that want him to clone people.
4291302	4293705	Anyways, he's all, so we should go to the Olive Garden.
4293805	4297229	It's like eating in a giant kitchen of an Italian cliché.
4299591	4300152	That's great.
4302259	4305084	and motherfuck Taco Bell because they don't use real meat.
4305344	4307308	Del Taco owns you, bitch.
4309031	4310573	And Del Taco makes me feel sick.
4311054	4315642	Oh, and F you to the freaking, what was it, that show Hot or Not.
4318243	4322106	You ripped off a fucking website, you're calling it your own, then you fucking botched the whole thing.
4322226	4323447	And who do you have on the show?
4323467	4328931	You have Lorenzo Llamas on there, and he's like saying, I don't like women with fake breasts.
4329091	4333354	Oh wait, I was married to one at one point, but I don't like women with fake breasts.
4334495	4337217	It's like Anna Nicole Smith saying she has good taste in makeup.
4341627	4360098	I'd just like to say a massive fuck you to every single goddamn person who waits until the fucking last minute to buy their Sherry's Berries so that they can get something special for their loved one and they wait until the day of so that they can say, oh, can you deliver this for me today?
4360338	4361519	No, fuck you.
4362259	4363680	We did everything through FedEx.
4363720	4364961	You're too goddamn late.
4365181	4367182	Go to the store and wait in line like everybody else.
4367662	4368423	So fuck you people.
4372954	4374655	I don't really have any right now.
4374715	4376077	I'm too happy and drunk.
4378879	4380321	Hang on, we're seeing if Ross doesn't fuck you.
4380741	4381602	Ross doesn't have a fuck you.
4384164	4385025	I got another fuck you.
4385425	4388228	Fuck Sega for stopping making Dreamcast.
4388728	4390130	I'm not buying another game from you.
4390250	4392091	I'll be burning your shit on the internet happily.
4392352	4395775	I will never pay for another Dreamcast game because you bastards didn't support the system.
4396015	4396616	Kiss my ass.
4397616	4397937	Actually...
4399054	4401595	Sega would not be in existence if they continued to support the system.
4401615	4402295	They would be bankrupt.
4402315	4403035	Are you kidding me?
4403275	4403995	I am not kidding you.
4405015	4405175	What?
4405475	4409576	They stopped producing the Dreamcast and stopped supporting it so that they could stay alive as a company.
4409856	4411537	We would not have any more Sonic Team games.
4411557	4417278	We would not have any new Knights, no new Sonic, no nothing, if they hadn't stopped their production of the Dreamcast.
4417378	4419238	I thought I would just let you know that.
4419878	4420918	Do you retract your fuck you now?
4421199	4421499	Yes.
4421879	4422399	Yes, I do.
4422459	4423319	That still sucks, though.
4424520	4429944	and F you to the stupid people on eBay who I'm buying the freaking Mystery Science Theater 3000 movies for.
4430004	4435028	Okay, listen, I'm buying 46 movies for about, eh, it's going about $52 right now.
4435608	4438670	Stop emailing me, you people, that I'm not bidding on your auctions.
4438970	4440732	They're trying to sell me movies for $5 a piece.
4440832	4446616	Listen, I'm buying taped movies because I can't, I already own all the ones that are legit, okay?
4446756	4448557	Don't try to sell me legit shit.
4448697	4449278	I already own it.
4450358	4452160	Fuck you to you, stupid ass.
4453366	4457027	AIDS-infected cocksucking motherfuckers who spam email people.
4457367	4466810	I get sick of going to my goddamn account and having to delete 135 messages because you guys can't stop telling me about ink cartridges and penis enlargement programs.
4467130	4469311	Look, if my dick was small, your wife wouldn't like it.
4469351	4470451	Quit fucking emailing me.
4473055	4482444	Just a side note on that one, does anybody ever notice that the females always get the ones for the dick enlargements, and the guys always get the ones for the boob enlargements?
4482825	4487910	Exactly, I think I just deleted something out of my box today, it's all Tealshark39, enhance your penis naturally.
4487930	4491634	I was like, wow, if I'm enhancing my penis, I've got a lot of issues right there.
4492754	4498681	I swear there was one guy who actually did an interview where he stated that he was happy spamming because he got paid.
4498941	4504327	If I see you on the street, I'm going to stomp your motherfucking nutsack and then I'm going to drop an elbow on your fucking nose and kill you.
4504588	4505509	DarkSakura's in the bathroom.
4505529	4506370	I'm going to give it to Loki.
4507890	4510652	and just so you know, spammers, I am happy with my breast size.
4511133	4515277	So stop sending me emails.
4515777	4519321	And like all the weird ones, like they send you, you just won this, you just won that.
4519801	4530172	And what's funny is all the websites that I go on to, I use different names, so they'll send me like, hey Bob Bob, you just won da da da.
4530888	4532249	You know what you're going to win if I find you?
4532269	4533610	A fucking hatchet to the head.
4533971	4534511	I'm sick of this.
4534611	4540736	Every five seconds, live nude girls getting fucked by horses in the ass while they're being, you know, blown by a fucking seal.
4541056	4542097	I don't want to see this shit.
4542437	4545540	I'm into some kinky shit, but I'm not into live nude girls being fucked by horses.
4545900	4547481	Quit mailing me this shit in my email.
4547501	4548122	I get sick of it.
4548142	4549563	I got to delete like 50 messages.
4549603	4550524	Want to see live nude girls?
4550684	4552025	No, you want to see live nude girls.
4552265	4556889	You're a 400-pound man sitting off in a goddamn room who hasn't seen a fucking pussy ever since you were born.
4557189	4558170	Leave me the fuck alone.
4559591	4562233	I've got another FU, and I think this is one that Rob would be proud of.
4562673	4573261	I'd like to say a massive FU for whoever the associates were at Fox that decided to freaking get rid of Frenchie, the only goddamn talent that they've ever had.
4574582	4580327	We can't have her on the show because American Idol has so much dignity, and she worked on a porn site.
4580367	4582468	Half of you are looking at it right now.
4583649	4585791	Back to the spam thing.
4586011	4588713	The best spam I have ever received, I actually kept.
4589326	4589826	Hello.
4590386	4592967	If you are a time traveler, I'm going to need the following.
4593567	4600128	One, a modified mind-warping dimensional warp generator number 524350A series wristwatch with memory adapter.
4600448	4605289	Two, reliable carbon-based or silicon-based time-transducing capacitor.
4605649	4606770	I need a reliable source.
4606870	4608490	Please only reply if you're reliable.
4608710	4610911	Send a separate email to me at and give an address.
4611391	4612771	What the hell?
4613621	4614722	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, Loki,
4633775	4637116	I check my email about eight times a day because of so much spam and it's in there.
4637136	4641478	I have to go and clean it out because I have a limited mailbox that I can have mail in.
4642438	4651221	But I have to say, I think I mentioned this a couple weeks back, the most creative email I've ever gotten trying to get my personal information was they sent this email from an actual legit...
4652521	4653842	Yahoo Service in India.
4672867	4674247	Yeah, there's something I'm comfortable with.
4674267	4677288	Sending out my personal information over the internet to somebody that I don't know.
4677648	4682389	Oh yeah, fuck you to Japanese pornographers who put those fucking little mosaics over all the good stuff.
4682449	4683369	I'm sick of that shit.
4684109	4684929	That's actually a law.
4685889	4688510	It's still a law, so they have to do it to sell their porn.
4689170	4690770	I want to see Anna O'Hearn naked.
4691690	4693671	I can show you Final Fuck X later.
4693691	4696931	Okay, my turn.
4702398	4705920	Thank you to alcohol for making me have to pee all the time.
4707981	4709502	Thank you again to the spammers.
4709822	4713024	But see, I only have two active emails that I use.
4713064	4716605	All the rest of my AOL names are blocked from the internet, but DarkSakura.com was left open.
4716625	4720167	I actually do have the site, but anyway.
4720487	4724970	DarkSakura at AOL.com is now blocked from everybody, except for the chosen few.
4725410	4726610	Yes, the chosen few.
4727071	4727751	Delete few.
4727831	4730392	And if you want to be among them, you can ask me, and I might say no.
4731133	4731193	Um...
4732709	4734410	And I'm not telling you my other one, hell no.
4736512	4741575	But my other one has to do with this stupid dumbass who walked out behind my car today.
4741635	4742455	I nearly ran him over.
4742896	4743276	And you know what?
4743336	4744176	I wish I had.
4744697	4747278	Because the world would have been better without him in the gene pool.
4749620	4757585	Fuck you goes to... He's like the little kid's pee or log floating in the gene pool.
4758826	4760827	Yes, he is the feces of the gene pool.
4762870	4767636	My other fuck you of the week goes to my Beatmania 2DX controller.
4768457	4773944	Now, normally when you have sticky keys on your 2DX controller, it's either going to be your first or your 7 key, am I right?
4775165	4775566	Typically.
4776427	4777769	My sticky key is my 4 key!
4778684	4781948	Yes, the top middle purple key, or blue, or whatever color it is.
4782448	4783009	It sticks.
4783770	4789176	It really makes it hard to try to pass R5, because you have that one key that's like the center key.
4789777	4794082	And then I come really close to passing a 7.
4794903	4795203	And then...
4796644	4797265	That sticky key.
4797545	4797905	Ruined it.
4798326	4804710	Which, by the way, also, fuck you goes toward, um, not Don't Look Back, because that's not in 8th style.
4804790	4805471	What's that song?
4806751	4807812	Please don't go.
4809453	4811475	I had a 78% on that first time.
4814757	4816958	So, fuck you to the chat room.
4816978	4817519	No, I'm kidding.
4818280	4825405	Alright, Jahi is going to read the fuck you's from the chatroom, but I'm just saying fuck you to please don't go because I had a 78% on that.
4825465	4826746	And by the way, I was not playing it easy.
4827987	4829488	So, um... Why are you looking at me?
4829808	4830288	Because!
4831129	4834171	I want you... You think I'm going to deny you the 7?
4834211	4834611	You're not.
4835712	4835912	No.
4836493	4836753	Okay.
4837113	4837393	Anyway.
4837413	4838414	Yeah!
4838474	4839515	Now to the chatroom fuck you's.

4923567	4923667	Oh.
4924287	4926648	I say not quite retail because it's not like Walmart or Target.
4926668	4930050	It's a little bit smaller so you can get away with a little bit more, but I'll give him an exception.
4930090	4930751	Dan's a cool guy.
4930771	4931331	Shout out to Dan.

4940235	4941776	He says he'll have to fuck you in a little bit.
4941816	4942576	He's finishing up dinner.
4942636	4943517	I say, too late!

5002353	5004214	Would you like to say something enlightening to the chatroom?
5005955	5008497	I really, really, really, really hate Sherry's Berries.
5010498	5012439	You heard it here on Orange Child Radio.
5012819	5013740	I'll alert the media.
5013880	5015021	Oh, wait, we are the media.
5016181	5016601	Me too.
5016702	5019143	I don't like chocolate-covered anything except ice cream.
5021704	5026347	Do you still want your bowl of ice cream and wetty rip and your two women...
5028413	5030455	Well, that's like ice cream.
5031215	5032457	It's Asian ice cream.
5033477	5033938	Oh yeah.
5035379	5036600	I think we should go to a break.
5036760	5037801	Who agrees with me?
5039062	5042725	Like, half of our people have already gone downstairs to watch the Ron Jeremy movie.
5046229	5047670	There goes one of our hosts!
5048467	5073420	We're going to an extended break, um, yeah, an extended break, some of us have to pee too, um, except I already went, you didn't need to know that, god, now I'm in here by myself, jeez, okay, yeah, well, fuck you, okay, um, I'm gonna go ahead and play some, um, you know, for Screw This Bit Money Stuff, I'm gonna play some, uh,

5082199	5086440	And on top of that, I'm gonna play, like, Japanese versions of these original stuff.
5087680	5089061	Although you've probably already heard these.
5089341	5091641	Oh, wait, do we have another Fuck You?
5091881	5096402	We might do Match Game later, but for right now, I'm not playing Jack Off Jill!

5808507	5810031	Thanks for watching!
5850948	5851709	We're back live!
5851989	5854710	That was a series of long versions.
5855110	5860473	The first one that we had was Enflo with Flojack, Mr. Drunk Remix.
5862150	5865573	Judy and Mary with Silbacassu, which, yeah, the English version was in DDR.
5866134	5870298	And then Gacked with Another World, a song that made it into Guitar Freak's seventh fix.
5871639	5872860	God, he's hot, isn't he?
5874121	5876323	Anyway, you want to tell us about the movie that everyone downstairs is watching?
5877784	5880967	They're watching Pornstar, The Legend of Ron Jeremy.
5881307	5886552	It's a documentary about Ron Jeremy, the most famous male porn star in the industry.
5887722	5892723	See, here's what's scary about the porn industry, and I read this from an article, actually, about another famous porn star.
5892763	5895124	His name slips my mind.
5895564	5896164	He's done a lot.
5896304	5896744	Rocco.
5896905	5898585	Rocco Cifredi, I think his name is.
5899065	5913329	The guy stated the fact that everybody in the porn industry has a case of herpes, and, you know, you may be looking at Jenna Jameson or Asia Carrera at home, but you have to consider the fact that they might have, like, more diseases than Nicole Smith has lawsuits over that old guy, so it's kind of scary.
5914821	5922147	Actually, Ron Jeremy said that he's only come down with, what was it, The Crabs and something else one time, but that was before he got in the industry.
5922167	5924769	He's been 21 years in the industry, and he's been clean the whole time.
5926010	5927831	Wow, he must have been getting some decent chicks in.
5927891	5928652	I mean, I'd be scared.
5928992	5931854	I mean, you know, you think about it, like, you hear about, like, gangbangs and stuff.
5932154	5932815	Who was the last?
5932975	5933495	Jasmine St.
5933555	5936498	Clair, and there was some other chick, Houston, I think her name was.
5937198	5939200	They go through, like, 500 guys.
5939940	5940681	That's scary.
5940701	5943383	You'd have to back a Ryder truck into that to catch a feeling.
5943403	5944444	That's, like, ugh.
5946462	5947503	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5969656	5969956	DarkSakura.com
5991874	5992575	We need more of that.
5992595	5999884	We need more women who are open about that sort of thing to actually get out there and talk to guys and completely shatter that whole stereotype.
6000405	6002448	Because I think it would make things a lot easier on guys.
6002488	6005312	Plus you'd let them know if they were in the friend zone a lot easier and that would help.
6006974	6009076	Nothing's hotter than a woman coming on to you.
6012188	6013129	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6025856	6026376	Not really.
6026617	6028438	Let's see, more stuff about Ron Jeremy.
6028918	6031540	His penis is 9 inches 3 quarters.
6032420	6033721	He can give himself head.
6034822	6038184	He's been in the industry 21 years, been clean ever since.
6040045	6043888	He's... I don't know, let me think here.
6043908	6045369	I don't know.
6046770	6047630	He's cool in orgasmo.
6049091	6051353	Orgasmo is a pimp-ass movie if you haven't seen it.
6053155	6056458	I don't know, maybe some of the women can respond to this in the chatroom too if there are any in there.
6056938	6062703	I've heard that women only like between 5 to 7 inches because 9 is painful or something.
6063184	6066186	I guess I'll make that little survey after DarkSakura gets back.
6066206	6067107	Let's know about that one.
6067628	6068508	Wait, she has something to say.
6069449	6071211	Yes, it's time to play Match Game!
6071771	6073192	Yay!
6073453	6075855	Maybe I won't play Match Game.
6080221	6090972	You know, we don't have our nice porn music playing in the background, so... Yeah, they're all downstairs listening to the... It's the porn groove.
6095177	6095477	Really?
6095917	6096618	What was that like?
6098180	6099021	Here, tell everyone about it.
6100521	6105626	Apparently he told some director that he could do that, and they're like, you have to do this on film!
6105666	6110810	And so the next thing they show is him kind of looking around in some really cheesy-ass film.
6111270	6113813	Next thing you know, he is kissing the tip of his own dick.
6114373	6118156	It's just like, that's really freaking impressive.
6118317	6124182	I did not see him giving himself head, I'm sure he could do it, but yeah, they actually showed him kissing himself.
6125922	6127563	He says he can't really give himself head.
6127603	6130465	He can just, you know, kind of get... Not anymore?
6131785	6133426	Yeah, well, I don't know.
6133446	6134607	He said he could only get the tip in.
6138129	6138950	I need to see that.
6140010	6143052	Okay, um, first of all, um, we need our two contestants.
6143092	6144193	We need one more person from downstairs.
6144213	6145273	Do you want to recruit somebody for us?
6148095	6149956	Okay, so we're having a four-person match game.
6150756	6154859	Um... Okay, um, chat room.
6155988	6162257	We'll take the first two correct answers, you can send it to me by private message How long is Ron Jeremy's dick?

6226975	6227456	Here's paper!
6230854	6235097	Oh, I have... Um, Loki's pen is missing.
6237799	6239240	Yeah, this is great radio!
6239341	6240521	Yay!
6241302	6244705	Um, we're gonna wait for, um, for, uh, Jahi to come back.
6244805	6249848	In the meantime, I think that I'll, uh, entertain everybody with real porn music!
6250629	6253011	Yes, it's real porn music here on Orange Niles Radio.
6337637	6339178	Okay, enough of the porn music.
6339859	6344381	Um, we're waiting for Jahi to get out of the bathroom, because he's got to pee, or something.
6344962	6346363	Don't sink out my bathroom!
6349064	6350585	He says he's just taking a leak.
6351886	6357310	Um, well shit, what are we going to do while we're waiting for him so we can... Okay, he's out.
6357970	6358811	Wash your hands!
6362413	6363834	Okay, we're ready to start this.
6363914	6364975	Yay!

6367020	6369601	So let's go ahead and get in the mood for a match game.
6372361	6373801	Okay, that's enough of that.
6373881	6376062	Alright, the first one for match game, remember...
6395325	6400308	And remember, for match game, for our guests, you have to fill in the blank.
6400529	6403250	And then we fill in the blank.
6403291	6404852	And if you get a match, you get a point.
6404992	6406753	It's just as easy as that.
6406953	6408374	So, our first one.

6541085	6548990	Um, after watching his first porn, Freddy the Fapper said that Ron Jeremy was his hero because he could get head while playing Metroid.
6553573	6556535	Um, he was his, like, uh, yeah.
6557335	6564540	He liked him because he, Ron Jeremy could have sex with many anonymous women at the same time.
6566519	6572081	Pleasing with his 9 and 3 quarter inch cock to porn music.
6573541	6573741	Yeah.
6575842	6584924	Ron Jeremy was his hero because he could buff his own pickle after it came out of the mouth of the woman that he was having sex with because his penis was so big.
6587005	6590206	I'm boring, I said, because he could suck it.
6593807	6594967	We have a match!
6597982	6621134	at one point goes to EvilNauki2DX because Rod Jeremy can suck his own cock I'm feeling silly already well you remember in Clerks the guy broke his neck because he tried to suck his own dick at least he died happy yeah at least he died happy
6623999	6627582	And eight days a week they had a guy that sprained his neck doing that.
6627682	6629503	And he's like, yeah, I got it in a little bit.
6630744	6631645	It tastes like bacon.

6639371	6644295	After drinking a whole lot of alcohol, Linda the Lush decided to play DDR while blank.
6645476	6646797	You give us the answer.

6713507	6714808	Nalki, give us your answer.
6719817	6721719	Actually, you know what I just noticed?
6739117	6740958	EvilNauki2DX has left our chatroom.
6741978	6744059	I just noticed.
6745559	6747800	Are we going to be able to find another contestant in the interim?
6748260	6750121	Who wants to take Naoki's place?
6750441	6751041	Or should we wait?
6751421	6752161	I don't know, chatroom.
6752842	6753962	Guys, should we wait for Naoki?
6755362	6756323	Can we give him a few minutes?
6756343	6760644	We'll go ahead and take another break.
6760664	6763085	We'll give him a few minutes to show up.
6764930	6769114	And if he doesn't show up, then we'll have to find a replacement.
6771115	6774298	Probably in the interest of fairness, we'll have to go ahead and set his point aside.
6774378	6779842	So we'll go ahead and play a song or two just to give him some time.
6779862	6780483	That's fair, right?
6781704	6782024	One song.
6782605	6784226	We'll go ahead and pick a song.
6784326	6784927	So I'll play...
6787262	6787782	You know what?
6788083	6795367	Just to put this in the interest of nice, pornerific music, let me go into my DDR directory here.
6797428	6807855	And we will play... God, as soon as I can find it... I can't find my song, dammit.
6808855	6809636	We'll play Doomie!
6810817	6814379	You have a minute and 21 seconds to get your butt back online.
6898783	6900044	Okay, Nelke's not back.
6900284	6905347	So, we're going to go ahead and pick the next person in the chat room.
6905407	6906988	We'll put it to a vote, okay?
6908749	6911070	Do we want 23 Magus or DarkTetia?
6911450	6911710	Vote.
6915253	6916513	Vote, 23 Magus or DarkTetia.
6918654	6919815	Just, just who do you want?
6920095	6920415	Pick one.
6922677	6923037	Who do you want?
6925616	6930698	DarkTesia, you've been voted in the Deathmatch Arena.
6931699	6933640	You've been voted onto the island, yes.
6934341	6942565	So, um, I guess we'll only do, uh, I'll have to think up another one while we're coming up with answers.
6942865	6944947	If you've got your answer, I'll go ahead and repeat the question.
6945927	6951811	After watching, I'm sorry, after drinking a whole lot of alcohol, Linda the Lush decided to play DDR while blank.

6967865	6968666	Think of your answer.
6968766	6969446	Answer us quickly.

7013286	7021192	So, my answer was Linda the Luscious had to play DDR while watching Ron Jeremy give himself head.
7022213	7022794	What is your answer?
7024275	7026056	She was playing DDR while masturbating.
7027518	7028118	Not a match.

7150410	7152111	We'll go ahead to EOSFB.
7154112	7156373	His penis wasn't as big as Ron Jeremy's.
7157834	7159075	What does that have to do with PA?
7159095	7159736	We'll never know.
7159756	7162617	Stop talking about Ron Jeremy, Perry!
7162657	7165079	DarkTestia says, because he was watching porn.
7167159	7174346	Okay, my answer, my answer, because Tigger already entered it and he would have won anyway.
7177408	7181772	Because it doesn't matter, because if Tigger enters, you're going to lose, so go home and sleep.
7183053	7183253	Yeah.
7185195	7188478	I said because he was too busy fapping to Anohor Prawn.
7189399	7190480	She has a really nice ass.
7193033	7195134	I said because, what did I say?
7195194	7197115	Because he was watching Ron Jeremy give himself head.
7200297	7202458	Both of those involve watching porn, right?
7204459	7206220	He gets a half point for each of those.
7206640	7209842	So yeah, DarkSakura is ahead by one point.
7214925	7217066	Okay, next question.

7294537	7295237	No, that's the wrong one.
7295377	7295718	My bad.
7296531	7299173	For his birthday, Loki asked for a bowl of ice cream and blank.
7300294	7302516	EOSFB said, Ron Jeremy porn.

7306338	7307179	Fuckin' A!
7307559	7308860	Stop talking about Ron Jeremy!
7308880	7310281	The show isn't about him!
7312063	7314985	Um, DarkTessia says, Asian midget porn.
7317130	7319251	The fuck would I want Asian midget porn?
7319631	7320992	They actually have Asian midgets?
7321012	7322133	That's what I want to know, man.
7323273	7324474	How tall do they stand?

7327596	7327916	Okay.
7330637	7334259	For his birthday, Loki asked for a bowl of ice cream and a license to kill idiots.
7336100	7337001	That's a close second.
7338381	7338722	Mine was...
7343570	7349316	A giant harem full of young Asian schoolgirls, naked and horny, with whipped cream.
7349616	7350577	Lots of whipped cream.
7351318	7354641	Actually, you know, now that I mention it, yeah, Asian schoolgirls naked.
7355201	7360787	And because I can't, you know, obviously I'm seeing someone, but you know, it's a gift, and it'd be wrong for me to refuse a gift.
7363810	7368034	Man, if you don't need all those schoolgirls, donate to the fucking Chinese schoolgirls fund for real.
7368815	7371657	But I was going to say a sweet transvestite from Transylvania.
7375980	7376981	No, not Rob.
7378602	7379363	We never know.
7381084	7384086	My answer was increased breast size from those spammers.
7385007	7386147	And increased penis size!
7388469	7390531	I'm sorry, we don't have a match.
7392932	7393633	No match for you!

7471578	7477381	Okay, after seven games of DDR, Darla the Dancer decided to go rest by blank.
7477841	7482744	EOSFB said, rest by cherry tree, er, I mean, Ron Jeremy's penis.
7485425	7487806	DarkTetsuya said, masturbating with a bottle of Propel.
7497172	7503976	How the hell do you masturbate with a bottle of Propel?
7504016	7511441	Now a bottle of balls, that's different because it's kind of, you know, ribbed on the outside, so I assume that women might like that, you know.
7513464	7520869	That's a little bit disturbing, but you could probably fit it inside, like, you know, like, Anna Nicole Smith's vagina, I guess, maybe.
7521689	7523831	Don't get me started on the stories I've heard before.
7524511	7525031	Such as?
7525872	7526733	My mom's a nurse.
7526773	7527633	I've heard stories.
7528033	7528914	Okay, where's story?
7531255	7531976	Yeah, I'll save it.
7532436	7534097	Okay, she's gonna save it, but I wanna hear this.
7534678	7535738	What's in their vagina?
7537740	7539641	Okay, we'll save that for right after the match game.
7539721	7540741	Is that fair?
7542042	7543023	My answer was
7545251	7549292	After playing seven games of DDR, Darla the Dancer decided to go rest by... Propel.
7551453	7551953	Just propel.
7553273	7553733	Your answer.
7554934	7559395	Well, rest by, are you talking about like an actual physical object that she's resting by?
7560355	7561156	Just propel.
7562096	7568598	Okay, well anyways, I was gonna say, uh, Darla the Dancer decided to go rest by watching Ron Jeremy suck his own penis.
7569338	7573139	Since obviously that was every fucking other answer, ugh.
7577154	7584660	Darla went to go rest by watching one of my ninja schoolgirls practice because I have ninja schoolgirls and they are kickass.
7587703	7591666	I decided she was going to rest by blowing up Roseville Golf Land.
7594148	7595810	I want this movie that has ninja schoolgirls.
7595890	7596950	Ninja schoolgirls are cool.
7598272	7600994	Dude, blowing up Roseville Golf Land sounds like my idea of restful.
7601614	7602515	Actually, it sounds exciting.
7602935	7604697	Okay, so DarkSakura gets half a point.
7604777	7605918	EOSFP gets half a point.
7606693	7608655	Which means that DarkSakura is our winner!
7608875	7612840	Yay!
7615402	7617004	You win a bloody anus!
7617845	7619066	Here on Originals Radio!
7622049	7626214	So Melody, you want to tell us about the segment, What Stuck Up the Vagina?
7629244	7636308	It actually wouldn't be a vagina unless spammers have actually come up with how to grow a new vagina instead of, like, increased breast size.
7636829	7645934	Now, my mom told me once she heard a story from an x-ray tech where this guy was complaining that, um, I don't remember what his complaint was, but they needed to do x-rays.
7646415	7654360	So, um, x-ray tech took him into the x-ray room and positioned him and everything, and she turns out the light, because you have to turn out the light to take an x-ray.
7654420	7656401	Well, there was still light in the room.
7657885	7661654	She can't figure it out until she realized the light was coming from the guy's ass.
7663137	7666605	Because he had inserted a flashlight and it had turned itself on.
7669542	7679971	Now, I can understand if, you know, you're a little bit kinky and, you know, there's nothing wrong with anal sex, that's your thing, you know, go ahead and do it, you know, as long as you're careful.
7680792	7688619	But there are just some things that shouldn't go in your ass, and I'm pretty sure flashlights, cell phones are one, but I'm pretty sure flashlights are up there in the top five.
7688879	7690941	Barbie dolls or others, hamsters, no.
7691762	7694384	You know, but, no, okay?
7694904	7696586	Just flashlights, don't play that game.
7698542	7701545	I'm no rocket scientist or anything, but you don't just fall on a cucumber, you know?
7701565	7702025	Wait, hang on, Melody.
7727080	7730421	My question is, why are you naked and falling on a cucumber in the first place?
7731181	7739824	I do that every day, you know, I go home at random and, um, I just grease up a Crisco, a cucumber with Crisco, I just fall on that motherfucker because I feel like it.
7740044	7741965	Fucking Johnny Knoxville wannabe motherfucker.
7744666	7746966	I think we should introduce a new segment on the show, by the way.
7748187	7749367	The Darwin Awards segment.
7751428	7754029	I'm going to read some information off of the Darwin Awards.
7754509	7755229	News stories.
7757634	7760577	We're going to read one called Midnight Snack.
7761217	7763399	Okay.
7763499	7764980	23rd October 2002, Australia.
7765561	7768183	What, besides beer, is Australia's most recognizable symbol?
7768643	7772567	Saltwater crocodiles, of course, as popularized by crocodile hunter Steve Irwin.
7773766	7775167	What is the most natural tourist activity?
7775447	7777787	Why viewing these amazing beauties in our natural habitat?
7778328	7789371	Tourists from around the world visit the wild places of Australia, so open water is routinely posted with a graphic warning sign to let people know that swimming with these dinosaur-like carnivores is not a good idea.
7789791	7792392	The sign typically shows a human figure between the jaws of a salty.
7793272	7798794	The blunt graphic has proven so effective enough that there have been no crocodile-related deaths in the Northern Territory since 1998.
7798834	7799334	At least, not until now.
7801849	7802430	Thanks for watching!
7811786	7816530	The woman, a short-lived member of an adventure tour group, was about to get more adventure than is generally advertised.
7816991	7819493	Police Commander Max Pope stated, How's that for stupid? !
7838964	7840205	That's not that bad.
7840285	7843047	I mean, I've seen, I've heard worse.
7843868	7857497	There was a funny one about some guy that like fell over a cliff or the, something about like, I don't know, it had to do with some guy in a tree or something and then there was a truck on a cliff or something and they backed it up and ran over the guy in the tree.
7857537	7859819	I got a Darwin Award.
7859839	7862120	Pump Daddy thought he could come up with something fucking original.
7862160	7862861	There's your Darwin.
7863902	7864562	Here's another one.
7865403	7866223	November 2002, The Netherlands.
7867694	7868556	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
7881264	7884847	Then a detective missed a bullet by inches when he opened a booby-trapped wooden chest.
7885307	7888409	Police beat a hasty retreat from the property and called in military experts.
7889030	7894374	They deciphered an enigmatic series of scribbled clues to locate 19 death traps in walls, ceilings, and household objects.
7895074	7902279	A pile of booby-trapped dinner plates was revealed by the clue, Cheaper by the Dozen, a reference to a film in which a child throws a plate at someone's head.
7902900	7905562	Police speculate that the notes were intended to assist his failing memory.
7906747	7915270	Other traps included numerous concealed shotguns triggered by threads and an exploding crate of beer set to detonate once a certain number of bottles were removed.
7916170	7921112	It took three weeks to crack 19 of the 20 clues, and experts were forced to admit defeat on the final note.
7921512	7924613	The Twelve Apostles are ready to work on the pebbles, said one.
7925033	7926734	We have never come across anything like it before.
7926874	7927954	It was all fiendishly clever.
7928726	7935947	True to form, the fiendishly clever but careless Darwin Award winner was described by neighbors as a tactical but harmless man who employed puttering in his garage.
7936787	7940068	But relatives say he never forgave his wife for divorcing him 20 years before.
7940828	7944889	Police believe he began installing the traps for four years after losing a lengthy battle to keep his home.
7945789	7954050	Although some may argue that 14 children in his advanced age rule out a Darwin Award, the judges feel the magnitude of his actions overcome by these practical concerns.
7955731	7956531	That one was cool.
7957651	7961314	Booby-trapping your home with 20 traps intended to kill your family.
7976878	7993227	In World War I or II, I can't remember which, I don't think I ever really knew, and he lives in the Midwest in Missouri, and he passed away recently, and my aunt and uncle moved into his house, and they were going through some of his stuff in his basement and found a bunch of his World War I memorabilia, and they found a hand grenade.
7994622	7997123	Now, they're like, okay, this is interesting, so they call the St.
7997143	8003004	Joseph's Police, who have no bomb squad, because it's not a small town, but it's not exactly huge, so they have to call Kansas City.
8003365	8008946	Well, Kansas City, of course, has a bomb squad, but they can't really do anything about it, because it's a good hour's drive away.
8010067	8015428	So, Kansas City says, okay, call Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, for help.
8016768	8017789	They call Fort Leavenworth.
8017829	8021870	The first thing that Fort Leavenworth says is, okay, well, where is the hand grenade?
8022987	8024908	And they're like, it's right next to us.
8025829	8029271	The first thing they say is, get out of the house this instant.
8030172	8031312	Hang up the phone and leave.
8031653	8038057	Because apparently these grenades, when they're this old, have a tendency to go off on their own, just from being handled.
8038297	8040839	My uncle was tossing the damn thing in the air at the time.
8040859	8044041	He was like freaking juggling the hand grenade.
8044481	8050625	Fort Leavenworth drove out to my uncle's old house, got the grenade, put it in a brawn-proof box,
8051354	8056496	Duck tape the box to all freaking hell and had to take it back to the base to be exploded.
8058056	8061518	Because remember, folks, duct tape prevents explosions.
8063618	8065739	And apparently it's good for acne or something.
8065759	8066680	I don't know.
8066700	8067840	Stupid as all hell.
8070201	8073942	And my uncle is stupid as all hell because, yeah, he's just in here and he's do-do-do-do-do.
8074182	8074943	Here's the hand grenade.
8074963	8076003	I think I'll toss it in the air.
8078744	8079004	Yeah.
8079614	8081295	I think on that note, we need to go to a break.
8082876	8093301	In this break, for the sake of Gumby, who is in our chat room, and hopefully listening to the show, we are going to play a song just for you.
8095122	8098424	We are going to play Bumblebee, Sky's Voice Remix.
8101705	8104747	And we are going to play some random other stuff, maybe...
8106812	8110253	Quick Master from Poppin' Music, and some other random stuff.
8111233	8116214	This is from one of Rob's fuck-off shows, so here goes.
8119615	8127576	Okay, I guess we're going to do one more, because I got these much better parody lyrics for Bumblebee than that shit I did a little bit ago, so we're going to do this one instead.
8127616	8130077	This comes from DDR Angel and Stressa.
8130097	8131537	This is much better, so enjoy.
8135522	8137844	I know I'm gonna fuck this up, I apologize.
8137864	8138245	Fuck you!
8163655	8187603	My foot kicks your ass when you walk in the room I go boom, boom, boom, you go zoom, zoom, zoom You're my format dance path, you're a real friend I wanna kick your ass until you're dead I'll shove my foot right up your ass To help you see it's true I don't like you, can't you see?
8187983	8189564	Now get the fuck away from me
8191656	8199778	Sweet little bumblebee, get the fuck away from me Sweet little bumblebee, just a bunch of fantasy Fuck you!
8430051	8430715	Thanks for watching!
8478854	8480025	Thank you for watching
8614167	8615327	I'm sorry, that was dead air.
8615387	8616027	My apologies.
8616427	8617188	We're live again.
8617868	8619068	Hey, let's do a quick promo.
8619368	8620328	Listen to our show's radio.
8620548	8621869	Yay!
8624255	8627337	Ask Orange Lounge
8648906	8650527	We'll send you answers!
8652208	8654629	In the interim, I'll go ahead... I just used a big word.
8654649	8655830	I wonder if they can understand that.
8656550	8656730	No?
8658391	8660392	Well, I have some, but not like I can play them on here.
8661713	8665134	Once we get about four questions up, then I'll go ahead and come back.
8665154	8671117	But right now... See, this is the song that I've been wanting us to play during our little questions.
8671177	8676080	And I dedicate this particular song to the dearly departed Oolong the Bunny.
8677421	8679323	We're going to cosplay Oolong the Bunny, aren't we?
8680964	8681965	I guess that's the plan, yep.
8682846	8683386	That'd be fun.
8684407	8685749	I have costumes sort of designed.
8685789	8687150	I'll have to draw it out for you.
8687250	8687910	It's really cool.
8691794	8695437	No, I have to make leg warmers, and I know how to do it.
8695898	8699261	You have to have the leg warmers and the bunny feet, but I know how to make bunny feet.
8699821	8701523	I know how to make bunny feet that fit over shoes.
8703491	8706273	All this bunny feet and leg warmer stuff's got me scared, okay?
8706313	8708535	I just, I wanted ears and a pancake.
8708795	8709295	That's it.
8709815	8711537	Ears, pancake, nothing else.
8713578	8714559	And this one's for Rob.
8714839	8715499	I want sleep.
8715879	8716460	Or pancake.
8718781	8719222	Fine.
8719662	8721143	Keep in mind, I am a cosplayer.
8723827	8726788	Anyway, we're going to wait until we get a few more answers in.
8726808	8732669	So in the meantime, this is the song that we wanted to have for our Ask Orange Challenge.
8732729	8735089	It's The Rabbits with Usao-kun from Keyboard Mania.
8736709	8738090	Usao-kun, Usao-kun
8756464	8784120	Kyou wa okozukai de HAPPY na GUTSU GETTO Demo nani kawuka Mayocchan da yone Genki itai Onaka mo itai Rinrin de herushii time ga Rikkuri time
8802162	8808045	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
8831101	8831542	We're back!
8831602	8832143	We're live!
8832623	8834746	And our first question comes from 23rebellious.
8835327	8843439	It said, What would I do with a video of Ron Jeremy and two kawaii Japanese girls in a bucket of chocolate ready whip?
8844340	8846063	I would go watch the video of Ron Jeremy.
8847623	8852007	I would send the two kawaii Japanese schoolgirls to go buy me some booze.
8853728	8856570	And I would eat the bucket of chocolate ready whip.
8857631	8859653	Did Udo and the bunny taste like chicken or pancakes?
8860193	8861054	He tasted like rabbit.
8862675	8865097	And from DarkTensia, who's the most drunk?
8865257	8865477	Me!
8867259	8868700	I don't think you're drunk enough yet.
8868780	8869561	Oh, shit.
8870722	8872363	Don't fall down the stairs.
8872383	8876066	Okay, that, I need...
8876553	8877273	That fell over.
8877474	8878174	I need to pick that up.
8879455	8880375	Don't stare at it.
8880836	8881676	You don't have to.
8882317	8883697	No, don't clean my house.
8884458	8884978	Oh, thank you.
8886259	8888000	Dude, Loki's cleaning my house.
8888180	8888740	That's cool.
8889841	8891462	So do you do Windows?
8893523	8894244	I don't do Windows.
8895044	8895204	What?
8901465	8902566	Do I do Windows?
8902686	8904267	Don't ask me, I've got the Mac.
8904347	8906529	My pretty little power book is sitting right here.
8915836	8916777	I'm a little tipsy.
8918098	8919939	Don't make me throw my empty flask at you.
8921420	8921960	Can I keep it?
8922601	8922881	No.
8926364	8926444	Um...
8928362	8931123	Yeah, we were doing Ask Orange Challenge, but only two of you people care.
8931744	8934105	So, we're going to do something else.
8934545	8936166	Hey, we have time for a list list, don't we?
8938087	8941748	Alright, well, why don't we do a list list that all four of us can participate in?
8943449	8950412	How about... Okay, alright.
8950873	8955815	We're going to do... For our list list, we're going to do... Favorite Alcohol!
8957372	8958813	For any reason whatsoever.
8960213	8961314	Here on Orange House Radio.
8962074	8964795	In the meantime, we'll go ahead and play more music.
8965616	8966556	I think I have some.
8966616	8967136	I don't have some.
8967376	8968337	Wait, we have more questions.
8969077	8969958	Is there a cage match this week?
8970078	8970938	No, because Rob's not here.
8971838	8972479	Next question.
8973879	8978841	23Megas, which is the better oxymoron, Microsoft Works, Legally Drunk, or Military Intelligence?
8979802	8982503	I think the only one of those that really counts is Military Intelligence.
8982763	8983043	Right.
8984004	8984624	Honest American.
8986400	8986920	I'm honest.
8987780	8990361	I'll go up to somebody and tell them that they fucking suck to their face.
8990721	8990961	Right.
8993082	8994182	Military intelligence.
8994242	8998423	Our nuclear weapons are in the hands of a man who cannot sing Jingle Bells.
8998823	8999704	There's a problem with that.
9000524	9001744	On a different subject, yes.
9002024	9003084	Jamie drives.
9003685	9010046	And Jamie driving... Driving with Jamie is kind of fun because she will tell everyone that they suck to their faces.
9010426	9011527	Plus, she will flip them off.
9011567	9013147	She will, like, speed around them.
9013187	9014688	If they're slow, she'll just go around them.
9014768	9015248	It's great.
9015328	9016148	It's so entertaining.
9018009	9019951	Jamie isn't called DarkSakura for anything.
9020292	9026258	She'll rage and demon your ass and then tap dance on your fucking grave like Savian Glover and then laugh at your family.
9026438	9026819	It's great.
9027574	9028354	That sounds like fun.
9028394	9029335	I should do that next time.
9032916	9039379	Okay, so I'm going to play a few songs while we come up with what are... Why do people have to get political on Orange Dolls Radio?
9039459	9039839	Fuck them.
9040199	9041320	That's because we're older than you.
9041840	9043561	And we actually have something called maturity.
9043861	9045642	We can freestyle better than you can.
9046562	9046942	That's it.
9047482	9049163	Because we can freestyle better than you can.
9049183	9050964	In both respects.
9051284	9053265	So, let's go ahead and go.
9053285	9053785	In both respects.
9078757	9086681	He knew every magic trick under the sun But he'd forgotten everyone and had some fun Monkey Magic, Monkey Magic Monkey Magic, Monkey Magic
9102426	9103147	Thanks for watching!
9125836	9134966	Smokey and everyone We do every magic trick under the sun Take the gods and everyone and have some fun Monkey Magic, Monkey Magic Monkey Magic, Monkey Magic
9395468	9396390	Thanks for watching!
9453823	9454523	Nico, meow.
9454724	9455364	Meow, meow.
9455464	9456204	Nico, meow.
9456344	9457005	Meow, meow.
9457025	9458025	Nico, meow.
9458245	9459186	Meow, meow.
9459526	9460066	Oh, ass!
9460627	9463308	This randomness could only be brought to you by Orange Lounge.
9467250	9467710	We're back.
9469391	9470672	And we want to say bye to everybody.
9471913	9475134	Bye-bye, everyone, all the listeners of Orange Lounge.
9475655	9476135	I am Outer.
9476175	9477315	I am taking off for the night.
9477375	9478056	Bye-bye.
9480294	9480674	Take care.
9480734	9481295	Drive safely.
9481655	9483096	Bye, Waifipu.
9483856	9484477	Take care.
9488919	9490060	Okay, so we're back.
9490140	9492341	We've all got our song.
9492381	9494903	So why don't we just go ahead and we'll start with Loki.
9494923	9497184	What's your top number three alcohol?
9499506	9500646	Because I don't drink alcohol.
9501147	9504649	We'll go with number three being Grog because Monkey Island rules.
9506903	9508204	Okay, number three, Grog.
9508805	9509126	And yours?
9510687	9517535	Number three on the tone poll would probably have to be Smirnoff Vanilla Twist Alcohol.
9517936	9518616	It's good shit.
9519377	9520538	Perfect for mixing with drinks.
9520879	9521740	Especially orange juice.
9521760	9522120	It's good.
9523882	9524843	Vanilla and orange.
9524863	9526085	Doesn't it be like a cream soda, wouldn't it?
9529178	9531420	We actually did have another participant.
9531460	9532901	I'll go ahead and name my number three.
9533481	9535223	My number three is Whaler's Vanilla Rum.
9536203	9536544	Yummy.
9538345	9542128	I hold Mike now as she types in Whaler's Vanilla Rum, which is probably really good stuff.
9542388	9544610	Our fourth participant is downstairs.
9545731	9547252	DarkSakura's going to get her right now.
9548934	9550515	She's getting the name of her favorite alcohol.
9552416	9553117	She's picking one.
9556455	9558576	She's giving her something to drink right now, I don't know.
9560036	9561076	Everybody!
9563777	9564937	Everybody!
9565318	9569259	Wait, here's Melody with her third favorite alcohol.
9569979	9571039	Vodka, any of it.
9572379	9573220	Any type of vodka.
9574580	9576941	Um, number two favorite alcohol, Matt.
9578361	9580702	Um, this is for Rob because I don't have a number two.
9581122	9581942	Goldschlager.
9589502	9591702	Number two would have to be Sapporo Beer.
9592663	9594083	Sapporo is the best beer.
9594103	9596004	It has high alcohol content.
9596024	9597284	It's perfect with sushi.
9597864	9601345	Especially if you're watching schoolgirls or chicks in maid outfits doing their thing.
9601385	9601845	It's great.
9601925	9604086	Or guys in school uniforms.
9604346	9604946	That's another story.
9604966	9605226	Anyway.
9606607	9607647	Actually, I take it back.
9608327	9609227	Rum is number three.
9609267	9610127	Vodka is number two.
9611408	9611848	There you go.
9614432	9618020	My number three is Godiva, of course, chocolate liqueur.
9618842	9622149	How can, for me, my number two, sorry.
9622830	9623291	Your number one?
9624619	9636343	My number one has to be Peppermint Schnapps, because after about a full bottle of that, both my ex-girlfriend and her friend, I think, went lesbian for like the night.
9636523	9638524	So, I dedicate that to them.
9640145	9643286	You know, that's one of those things that's going to kick me the rest of my life.
9643406	9644086	No, I did not.
9644946	9645167	Yep.
9645587	9647567	So, we think.
9647627	9648148	We don't know.
9648168	9651729	They disappeared into my room for a while, and they don't remember anything that went on.
9653880	9654480	So they say.
9655881	9662205	If your ex-girlfriend and girlfriend ever disappear into a room under the influence of alcohol, you better be up in that motherfucker.
9663226	9664947	Yeah, ex-girlfriend and her friend.
9665487	9668309	Well, she was my girlfriend at the time, so yeah, I should have, but...
9668942	9672164	I would have been all over that like a bad rash on Pamela Anderson Lee.
9672524	9676887	Number one would have to be the Godiva soy milk combination that I had tonight with DarkSakura.
9676927	9677788	That's the new number one.
9677848	9679769	Goes down smooth and goddamn, I'm buzzin'.
9680309	9684792	I'm so numb that somebody could cut my arm off and beat me with it and I would not feel it.
9684852	9688895	First off, listen, hey Jamie, you wanna go in that room five feet away and lock the door?
9689275	9691917	Well, you know, they did say that after I got socially drunk I'd turn lesbian.
9692457	9693258	Woohoo.
9693738	9694198	Woohoo.
9694218	9696460	Remember, don't say unless you mean it!
9697180	9698321	I want photos!
9699114	9704936	And my number one has to be that Vermeer chocolate liqueur that Mel gave me because good lord that shit is good.
9705797	9707017	V-E-R-M-E-E-R.
9707857	9710318	It's Dutch chocolate liqueur and you can get it at Safeway.
9710618	9711039	Best ever.
9711499	9716020	Shouts out to Felix the Friendly Traveler for providing the alcohol at DistortedEchoes.com.
9716040	9720082	Go pick up any project that Lawrence Trifon and Felix the Friendly Traveler do because that's dope shit.
9720402	9721502	Felix, you may never know.
9721522	9722323	2003, I could come back.
9723977	9728439	My number one would be Just Desserts brand creme brulee liqueur.
9729500	9730720	You get it at Trader Joe's.
9730781	9732141	It's the only place I've seen that one.
9732782	9735603	And it's like $6 a bottle and it tastes like it should cost more.
9735643	9736824	That stuff is the best.
9736844	9740525	So do you want to go ahead and vote off one?
9743107	9744027	Okay.
9744708	9747709	Just because someone else is going to vote it off and I'll just save them the time.
9747749	9748129	Grog.
9748309	9753032	Because that's a stupid third pick by me and I just don't care.
9753152	9753452	I'm tired.
9756497	9765122	Um, we have to get rid of the Sopro, even though it's one of my favorites, because it is a... I put it on there, but in comparison to the other alcohols, it's a beer.
9765622	9767403	And beer just doesn't stand up to liquor.
9767923	9771285	Although it is an acquired taste, liquor has more of a flavor to it.
9771645	9775127	You can't mix liquor... You can mix liquor with anything, you can't mix beer with anything.
9775607	9779049	So... Vote one off the island.
9781170	9781850	Uh, Jerry!
9782010	9784912	No, um... Um, what are our options?
9784992	9785512	American Idol!
9786208	9793129	I'm saying rum because even though I voted it on, I got really freaking drunk on it once and it made me unhappy.
9793770	9795290	God, everyone's voting their own shit off.
9795650	9796850	You left the light on in the bathroom.
9797170	9797710	Oh, that's why.
9798170	9798371	Okay.
9800011	9801251	You know what I'm going to vote off?
9802691	9803692	Peppermint schnapps!
9805832	9810733	Because I've had peppermint schnapps before and I thought it was going to kill me.
9810833	9811853	It tasted like burning.
9812893	9815434	It tasted like burning heat.
9819728	9821409	That's what they felt that night.
9823049	9823570	God damn it.
9824130	9832534	You see, Peppermint Schnoss, man, that shit got my ex-girlfriend to yell, I can suck his dick and you can't, arguing with her friend.
9833374	9835795	I just heard you say that you can suck someone's dick.
9836535	9839176	No, I was quoting my ex-girlfriend, okay?
9840197	9843578	There's absolutely nothing wrong with sucking dick as long as the person is clean.
9843618	9844839	Let's not get that twisted.
9845766	9849949	Although I don't know about Loki's sex life, the guy's cute enough, but that's another story too.
9850470	9852471	Don't say that shit while I've been drinking.
9853952	9856894	We're fucking listening, so obviously you only caught the last half.
9857755	9859716	I still want Gak's sexy body, but anyway.
9860337	9862138	Uh, do I get to vote another one off now, or?
9863979	9864160	Ow!
9865681	9866001	Bitch.
9868523	9869003	No.
9870184	9872726	Chatroom, this is where you decide.
9873957	9875838	Oh, God, I didn't mean too loud.
9875978	9877278	Too loud, I didn't mean too loud.
9879058	9883700	Okay, you've got a few minutes to send me your votes.
9884780	9886280	If you don't send me your votes, I kill you!
9886781	9887881	I mean, wait, I don't kill you.
9887901	9889001	You're so stupid!
9890522	9896523	Send me your votes, and in the meantime, just to make Jahi happy, we're gonna play MC Hawking.
9896983	9899364	So yeah, if you want MC Hawking to end,
9900004	9903245	Send in your vote for best liquor.
9904546	9907247	I'm going to re-read the list and I'm going to post it into the chat room.
9908367	9909167	Just give me a second.
9909207	9910248	God, I'm so uncoordinated.
9912208	9914569	You know, I stay vaguely coherent when I'm alcoholic.
9914609	9915009	When I'm drunk.
9923217	9925158	It won't let me paste it into the freaking chat room.
9925778	9926299	Oh, there we go.
9926419	9926779	Damn.
9926899	9927119	Okay.
9928540	9929720	So vote for one of those.
9930761	9933002	You have, um, how long is this song?
9933602	9934303	Um, shit.
9934663	9936424	Three minutes and twenty-five seconds.
9937124	9938545	Vote now, or die.
9938565	9945589	Ah, yeah.
9945789	9947529	That's right, motherfuckers.
9949430	9951552	I'm back, riding a funky track.
9952925	9955847	I got a story to tell you all, so listen up.
9957307	9958788	Yo, trip on this.
9960749	9962830	I'm rolling through the boat on a Saturday night.
9962910	9970054	Got a 40 in my left hand, dick in my right, some cronk in my left, a pager in my hat, and a 9mm in the small of my back.
9970194	9972014	I'm just chilling no place to be.
9972315	9974416	I take another blow off my 40Z.
9974576	9976837	I'm thinking about skinning a fat ass tree.
9977017	9978698	A B to the L to the U-N-T.
9979338	10001410	Then I get a call on my dope cell phone, check the caller ID, plug up Holmes, yo it's the Doom and his news ain't good I feel like the world is fading away, I saw little Pookie just the other day, Pookie was my boy we shitted Kool-Aid in the park, now some punks took his life in the dark, I asked Doomsday who the motherfuckers be, some punk ass bitch from MIT
10002310	10021638	The fucking Institute, man I should've known I say meet me at my crib and hang up the phone Playtime's over, I got a job to do And the world will be less crowded by the time I move And I'll keep rolling while bullets fly Cause all my shootings be drive-bys Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't drop bars Don't, don't, don't, don't drop bars
10034034	10060607	One minute to midnight, we hit the street, cold as a cadaver, hard as concrete Doomsday's hacking, Baby Mac got my AK-47 and the 9 in my bag The Alpine's blowing, PE's blowing, got my swerve on tight and my game face showing Them damn punks are gonna pay, the hawks on the case, a bird of prey Then up ahead, cold chilling in the street, 6 motherfuckers from MIT I flick off the safety, check my grip, and bloat
10061207	10090019	A dumb dumb clip, I glance at the Doom to make sure he's hacked His fingers on the traitor of his baby mech Time to give a Newtonian demonstration Of a bullet, it's mass and it's acceleration Dying on my lap, AK in my hand I roll up slow, like a snake in the sand I wait till I'm sure they can see my face Then I bust out slugs to the beat of the bass Streets sketched out in the full moonlight MIT punks dying left and right There's nowhere to run, don't even try Cause all my shootings be drive-bys
10094424	10094986	Broadbite
10110683	10130533	Then silence hits the street like a bomb, and eerie calm like the eye of a storm Beneath the glow of an old streetlight, dab MIT punks in the only sight Six motherfuckers no longer alive, cookies in a bench, one for one plus five And we'll be long gone before the cops arrive, cause all my shootings being drive-bys Hi-ya!
10131073	10134535	I'm busting more shit than an incontinent man at a chili cook-off
10135934	10142318	The moral of the story is, don't fuck with the Hawkman, cause the Hawkman ain't dealt with an eye for an eye for shit.
10142799	10143579	Fuck that.
10144400	10147162	Take an eye, and I'll take your motherfucking head.
10164568	10170352	Please listen to Orange Lounge Radio, because real radio makes Captain Jack cry.
10173934	10176915	We're back.
10177176	10178256	We almost have winners.
10178616	10180858	In the meantime, though, we're going to give the microphone to Jackie to rant for a while.
10181917	10182477	Cool.
10182878	10183838	I get to rant.
10184779	10185579	I don't know if it's a rant.
10185599	10187521	They're discussing the alcohols right now.
10189022	10190262	They're doing rock, paper, scissors.
10190743	10191943	They're still making a decision.
10193184	10195426	If we have an afterbirth tonight, I might kick some shit.
10195466	10195886	I don't know.
10196286	10197987	That was MC Hawking on the last track.
10198007	10200989	One of the hardest motherfuckers I know with all my shootings being drive-bys.
10201810	10203271	And I wouldn't fuck with him because he'll shoot you.
10204291	10205672	Alright, well we have our three winners.
10206272	10206773	Number three...
10208516	10211458	Godiva and Vanilla Soy Milk combo.
10211558	10213220	I'm going to get another one right now.
10213900	10217063	Don't drink up all the Godiva though.
10217143	10219765	Second place is Smirnoff Vanilla Twist Alcohol.
10221046	10223007	And number one is Godiva.
10223748	10225309	Yay!
10225329	10228952	None of those people had Vermeer.
10229552	10231193	The Vermeer though is pretty kickass.
10231273	10232434	I just couldn't think of how to say it.
10232474	10233395	I didn't want to misspell it.
10234656	10235416	Yeah, that's me.
10238277	10240099	Anyway, we've got two minutes left in the show.
10241720	10242140	I don't know.
10242480	10243922	You had something you wanted to talk about, right?
10245163	10245663	I guess.
10246624	10249026	Uh, yeah, sum it up in a few seconds.
10249506	10254830	Guy makes 2600 Atari game of DDR type thing.
10255070	10255831	Sucks ass.
10256031	10256331	The end.
10257953	10259154	Do we know where this can be found?
10260435	10260635	Nope.
10261095	10261936	Can't remember offhand.
10263396	10265717	You see that box there with the mushrooms on the lid?
10266658	10274822	Those are 2600 ROMs and they're actually game chips and a thing to play them on a 2600.
10274882	10275023	Cool.
10275083	10280025	I think Custer's Revenge is in there somewhere.
10283127	10283547	Yeah.
10284628	10286089	I'm real interested.
10287129	10288190	Pixelated penis!
10289505	10291627	Custer's Revenge is so funny.
10292248	10292608	No!
10292968	10293969	Custer's Revenge.
10294950	10295151	For the 2600.
10295351	10297273	The porn game.
10298914	10301497	Yeah.
10302318	10303038	Custer.
10303699	10304079	Anyway.
10307042	10309365	Did you ever see the one called X-Man?
10310426	10312348	It was this guy who was scissors.
10314296	10315997	The Sky Running Through A Maze
10330660	10332681	And it's like pixelated cock and everything.
10332741	10335442	It's really, really scary and really wrong.
10336123	10339864	And anyway, on the note of pixelated cock, I think that we should go ahead and end this bit of rain, right?
10339884	10340585	Because you know what?
10341345	10344066	I don't think I'm going to do very well at a drunk show next time.
10344106	10345107	We wait until Rob's here.
10345807	10347888	And then I'll drink and let him be the sober one.
10347928	10349569	Just give me the afterbirth part.
10349869	10350970	Just give me the afterbirth part.
10350990	10351890	That's disgusting.
10352390	10354611	Well, yeah, but I can be disgusting.
10355312	10358313	So why don't we go ahead and say our final thoughts for the evening, Loki?
10359488	10361230	I'm tired and I need to work on my website.
10362331	10362852	Yes you do.
10363433	10363773	Melody.
10364614	10364934	Catch.
10367257	10370601	Sorry out there to all you people who just got like an ear full of futon.
10373465	10373725	Jahi.
10375629	10378371	There's a certain someone I'm waiting to get me a call on Valentine's Day.
10378411	10379532	Hope she calls me.
10380053	10382795	Motherfuck Puff Daddy and a ton of other people in the industry.
10383316	10384296	I'm bitter, goddammit.
10384336	10385157	Fuck Walmart.
10385217	10386578	Fuck a whole bunch of other people.
10387099	10389181	Godiva and Soy Milk is really good.
10389281	10394765	Thanks to Jamie for allowing me to speak on OrangeLounge.com.
10395386	10398268	And that's it.
10399469	10400070	Sadly enough...
10400811	10403393	After, what, did I have like five or six drinks?
10404374	10408678	I'm still not, I'm still not drunk that bad.
10409599	10415624	Um, so... I wish I could go to the strip club, but that's a lot of money and I don't have the money.
10419087	10419447	I'll go.
10419467	10422890	Um, so let's go ahead and end this train wreck.
10422910	10425993	Stay tuned, though, for a special messy surprise.
