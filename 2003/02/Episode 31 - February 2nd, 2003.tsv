6029	9513	Do you want to hear the most annoying sound in the world?
11515	16561	You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio, the Monty Talk, and then some.
20214	23096	Orange Lounge may contain adult content.
23456	26619	Orange Lounge may contain many four-letter words.
27199	29921	Orange Lounge may contain a scene of nudity.
30461	33343	Orange Lounge may contain hot monkey sex.
34144	34564	Just kidding.
34744	36345	Orange Lounge will not contain hot monkey sex.
36565	37206	In this episode...
42765	46227	I'm sorry, but all questions must be submitted in writing.
46247	48209	Why did they have to take the word gay?
73878	76339	DarkSakura, Sky, Loki, Orange Lounge Radio,
99529	103591	We are live, and this is episode number 31 for February 2nd of 2003.
103671	109393	You're tuned into the Bomani Scene's most grounded radio station of all things B-Money.
110034	111875	My name is Rob Roberts, you might know me as Sky.
112675	114636	Joining me as always are my awesome co-hosts.
115376	119018	In the invisible corner is the happiest bunny on the farm, Miss Jamie Summers.
119038	121199	You know her better as DarkSakura.
121239	123320	She's running in here like a chicken with her head cut off.
123380	123740	What's up?
124220	126141	Oh, okay, cool.
127721	127982	Did you?
128022	128542	Yay, thank you.
131948	132188	All right.
132969	135370	And you get... We have horrible mic noise again tonight.
135390	137911	And I swear to God, I fixed this problem before the show started.
137971	138752	It's pissing me off.
139292	139972	I'll see what I can do.
140713	141873	I'll see what I can do during the first break.
144190	147051	Also, say hello to our other lovely co-host.
147551	149052	I should say more handsome co-host.
149072	150232	I don't think he likes to be called lovely.
150592	151592	Our handsome co-host.
151972	153193	Say hello to our tech master, Loki.
153253	153673	Hello.
155514	158474	Also with us tonight, we have a whole buffet of guests in studio.
158534	159455	Say hello to Brad.
159675	160115	Buffet.
160295	160775	Mmm.
161135	161675	And pancakes.
162176	165717	And we haven't had this gentleman on the show before, but say hello to Zero.
166217	166797	Hey, how's it going?
167603	170404	and also out in the other room playing Animal Crossing's Irene.
170424	172584	She probably won't be on the show because she always plays Animal Crossing.
172704	174065	Bitch!
175365	175745	Pancakes.
176105	176545	Pancakes.
177586	177866	What?
179266	185188	Dave, are you listening?
185228	186128	You should be over here right now.
186148	186648	I don't know.
186668	187528	That is a good question.
187568	188849	Where has Dave been?
189009	189989	He hasn't been here for a few weeks.
192347	193867	Where's Puppy and Tal?
194007	195989	Puppy and Tal are at Scandia.
196069	199130	They were there for Tal's birthday and they were supposed to be here by now.
199150	201071	But they're not.
201351	203032	So that means punishment.
206593	207494	So, yeah.
208394	208715	Hello.
208835	210636	So, we're going to talk about a whole bunch of stuff tonight.
210936	215140	We have interviews from the tournament that happened on Friday at Milpitas, Milpitas Golf Land.
215160	215680	We've got those.
216240	217802	I know tons of you are just looking forward to that.
218862	222365	And we'll get to everything else a bit later, but first we're going to take a quick break.
223006	225728	And I thought we'd start off this first break with some...
227849	229431	Oh, any other opening thoughts from the folks here?
230432	231653	Oh, did the missing people just show up?
231853	232594	Oh, let's say hello to them.
232814	233474	Oh, there they are!
233755	234355	You're late!
234575	236397	You're late!
236917	237198	What's up?
237238	238138	Okay, we have Tau.
238178	238739	Say hello to Tau.
238919	239359	Hi.
239900	240781	And then we have Puppy.
240981	241541	Puppy's here.
241621	241962	Hi.
243443	245024	And then, in the back, there's Ryan.
245104	246045	Oh, shut the fuck up.
247629	247910	What?
248691	251113	Shock of Duval, I don't know, you know what I mean, right?
251254	252015	Okay!
252395	253196	Shock of Duval!
253376	259604	Oh, I'm, uh, I received a message from the chatroom, snub, just once told me Dave is in Houston, visiting the grandparents.
259644	259764	Really?
259784	260925	That's where Dave is.
260946	262387	Well, we were asking where Dave is.
265411	266492	Dude, what the fuck is that?
266512	266813	What happened?
269091	270492	I heard a can of soda opened.
270512	274835	The Mountain Dew's not supposed to smell like that, yo.
277016	278477	It's always exciting here at Orange Mountain.
278497	279818	The Red Mountain Dew smells like a fart.
282519	282839	Alright.
283840	284761	What the hell is this?
284841	285321	D&L?
286562	288163	It's 7 Up Upside Down.
288183	288863	What is this?
291212	299336	DNL is basically, it's like the opposite of 7up, as in the logo is upside down, and instead of being a green bottle with clear liquid, it's a clear bottle with green liquid inside.
300277	302638	It's caffeinated, instead of just being, like, fucking normal.
303218	306600	It tastes like 7up with a kick of Mountain Dew, and it's actually really good.
307721	309622	Yeah, but this shit I've been drinking, like, day and night.
309642	311122	It's, like, better than blue.
312063	312623	It's okay.
314544	315065	It's okay.
315205	315685	It's alright.
316465	317466	Okay, we're gonna take a break now.
317506	319647	We'll come back and talk about all the, uh,
320185	321566	Yeah, Surge was what I was going to say.
321586	322127	It's kind of like Surge.
322147	322387	Anyway.
322727	323228	I like Surge.
323428	324089	We'll take a quick break.
324129	324929	I hate knowing you.
325430	334598	And we'll be back to talk about all sorts of fun things, get to those interviews, maybe play some of the money match games, some of our favorite stuff, and taking your calls.
334918	335399	Just kidding.
335419	336199	We still have the phone.
336500	337000	We'll be back.
368625	369710	Thanks for watching!
592288	593529	Orange Lounge Radio.
593849	596010	We put your thing down, flip it, and reverse it.
596850	606434	Hi, we're back, and you're listening to Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 31.
607215	607735	How you doing?
608355	609616	I'm eating a golden stream.
609796	611817	Mmm, you're munching on a golden stream, huh?
611997	614558	I didn't have my nuts today, so now I have my golden stream.
615078	615358	Yum.
615398	616639	Tell us about golden stream.
616659	617099	What is this?
617579	619000	It's a brand of trail fish.
620020	622941	And I don't like the apricots with the raisins in it, so I'm eating everything else.
623161	623562	Ah, okay.
623742	625642	No apricots for you.
625702	626363	I love coconut.
627563	629844	Last night at TGI Fridays, I had the coconut chicken strips.
629884	630144	Yum.
630624	631085	Delicious.
631985	632325	Anyway.
632345	632925	What?
633546	634666	What are you giving me?
634906	635726	Ooh, I get coconut.
635806	636467	Mmm, yum, yum, yum.
637967	639228	Oh, happy birthday, Tao.
639788	640468	Yay.
641068	642249	How old are you now?
642709	642829	I'm 22.
642949	645930	And has anybody given you spankings yet?
647031	647151	Uh...
649382	650562	Is anyone giving you spanking chat?
650782	660827	Let's see, I was spanked in Beatmania, I was spanked in, uh, fucking playing Civilization the board game, I was spanked in Street Fighter, every game I played against other people yesterday I was spanked in, if that's what you mean.
663248	664108	Yeah, sure, that's what I meant.
665229	666309	Well, open up your present.
666429	668710	Loki's given, given, uh, Tal a present here.
671632	674133	It's got, it's got tape on it, dude, I'm not that lead.
674933	675834	Use your nails, dammit.
677646	678967	Use your keys or something.
679148	687915	I have a knife, right here.
688596	689397	We have a holy shit.
689417	690298	Gee golly-ness.
691619	694001	Wow, there's like so much anime in here.
694081	699306	Wow, why are you still thinking that in my face?
699326	701007	Because we want to hear what you've got.
702268	703910	Name an anime and it's probably in here.
704696	709221	Or at least ones that haven't come out yet, like Noir and KKNJ, or I'm sorry, In America, his and hers.
709942	711623	Stupidest goddamn translation of a name ever.
712685	713405	Nuku Nuku!
714326	716188	Ooh, now what is this shit here?
717690	718311	What the hell?
718351	718871	Yes!
718911	720673	This thing is rad!
724969	729093	But the big box that it came in has got cool anime people on it and it looks tight.
729113	729814	You know what?
730054	730294	What?
730615	734018	Someone needs to bring Crossfire to this show and we're going to have a Crossfire tournament.
734178	737141	Alright, that game right there, that is Beyblade.
737261	738403	It's Fighting Tops.
738483	743027	Can you believe that they made an anime about people fighting tops?
744148	745769	It's the most retarded thing ever.
746230	748331	You believe this chick has missile boobs.
748772	753375	No, allow me to read the back of the Beyblade DVD.
753776	758079	As a young Beyblader, Tyson has a dream to be the best blader in the world.
758539	764464	Feeling confident with his technique, Tyson decides to challenge Kai, the leader of the undefeated Blade Sharks.
764924	765965	Did they challenge God?
766465	766845	Kai.
767045	767225	Oh.
768066	769786	Oh, so now they have a Digimon character in here.
769887	770087	Yes.
770827	773708	Unfortunately, Tyson is crushed by the awesome power of Kai's blue blade.
774369	777690	Vowing revenge, he begins his quest to rebuild his Beyblade.
777790	779691	Oh my god, this is the fruitiest goddamn thing ever.
784454	785954	Yes, we did talk about GoldenStream.
786795	789376	So, why is it that, like, all you Bomani freaks are into anime?
790945	793486	Why is it all the anime freaks turned into Bimani is what you mean, right?
794146	795106	We were here first.
798868	803369	Well, I mean, it's like, um... What the hell is Black Lion?
803409	804149	I haven't even looked at it yet.
804670	805950	You don't know Black Lion?
806910	808591	Man, old school.
809091	810572	Well, not really old school, but it's still pretty old.
810592	815673	You know, if you'd only entered the edit contest, you would've probably won that.
816234	817174	What edit contest?
818975	820275	The one that was on Friday?
821489	822410	The one that you missed?
822570	825111	I went to go play TDX, my headache was.
825432	825872	Whatever.
827033	827473	I'm sorry.
828013	828454	Sheesh.
829014	829774	I can't make edits.
829834	832796	My edits are like... My edits are like the Monty Ruler edits.
832816	833337	They're crappy.
833357	835018	If I make you an edit, you give me some porn.
837059	838019	Uh, okay.
838180	842202	Yeah, there you go.
842802	843083	Rob.
843883	844103	Rob.
844123	844944	Rob, put this in your butt.
845724	846245	Hi, what's up?
847265	848826	Sorry, I'm trying to work on that sound problem.
848866	849967	Nice hosting job, Rob.
850737	856479	We've got background issues today, so I'm trying to get rid of some of that background noise for you guys listening.
857199	858199	Does everyone else hear it?
858639	860180	Yeah, I hear it a little bit.
861200	868442	They're also having a little bit of a hard time hearing you, Jamie, so you've got to give head.
868962	869362	How's that?
869382	871343	Is that better?
871663	874144	I'm going to turn down our volume a little bit so that...
876892	881456	I'm going to turn down our mic volume, but everybody's going to have to talk super loud or they're not going to be able to hear you, so we'll go down a little bit.
881477	882377	That's not a problem.
882558	882918	All right.
883979	884439	Beautiful.
884800	886822	Let's talk to the person that hasn't ever been here before.
887482	887903	Oh, great.
888083	888884	What's up, Zero?
889244	889745	Nothing much.
890105	891807	So what brings you here to the studio tonight?
892247	893348	You invited me last week.
893628	894109	Oh, yeah.
895510	898313	So how did you get... Isn't Zero X old?
899854	900235	What do you mean?
901089	901469	Wait a minute!
917853	918434	I feel great now.
918854	921576	So how did you get into this whole stupid arrow smashing game?
922597	927341	Um, found it one day when I was on a vacation down in Santa Cruz, then heard RPG all night.
927421	929403	Oh god, you started playing at the boardwalk?
929623	930043	Yeah.
930304	930924	Oh shit.
930944	931905	The worst of the world.
932025	933466	Isn't that where they film The Lost Boys?
933887	934787	Yep, it sure is.
935988	938551	My, um, one of my fiance's friends is a DJ there.
938931	939171	Really?
939191	939612	DJ Trip.
940372	940672	Heard.
941493	943275	I haven't, like, heard of him, but I've heard.
945180	954849	Anyways, yeah, I started playing there, and then I heard, like, the horrible-ass RBGL had it, so I started playing there when it was good, and then... Well, it wasn't horrible-ass back when we started.
954869	958572	Not back then, but nowadays, that's why I said it was good back then.
958692	960934	23rd Magus had a funny new nickname for Roseville Golf Line.
960954	963116	Could you post that in the chatroom so I can read it, because it was funny.
964795	970339	Well, I mean, RBGL, when we started, dude, it had, like, you know, the fourth mix, the USA and stuff, and it was fun to play.
970399	976542	I mean, like, the first time I saw Kick the Can doubles, it was like, oh my god, there's someone playing doubles, and it's Kick the Can, hardest song ever.
977103	977683	Yeah, I know.
977983	992092	But, you know, things happen, and people change, and then they get Max, and instead of getting our fourth plus or our fifth mix, and then they get Max 2, and we still have the USA and Max 2, and they get, what is it now, fourth plus and Extreme?
992192	992332	Yeah.
995218	995619	Who cares?
995679	996419	I don't follow that crap.
996640	1010912	Of course, I got yelled at on... Because, you know, there's been kind of in the Sacramento community, and Orange Launch World Headquarters happens to be in Sacramento, and I know there's a lot of you not in Sacramento listening, but of course, if you listen to this show enough, you've kept up on Sacramento politics, because all we ever do is bitch.
1011453	1013054	That's what we're best at.
1014515	1017898	A lot of us are boycotting Rosso Golf Land because we're sick of their shit and they don't upgrade their games.
1018018	1020460	I got bitched at on DDR Freak because I...
1021221	1022642	Subtitles by the Amara.org community
1038849	1040350	You know, how am I going to pass up DDR?
1040430	1041491	It's like this, okay?
1041511	1045174	I'm going to go to Golf Land because I have tons of tokens I bought down in Impetus Golf Land.
1045234	1049158	No, I'm not going to drive two hours to go spend these tokens at another Golf Land.
1049218	1050999	They can go, you know, kiss my ass for that.
1051039	1052921	I already spent the money at Golf Land.
1052941	1054342	Golf Land already has my money.
1055003	1056084	It would be a waste if I didn't.
1056104	1058265	That's exactly what my point of view is.
1058285	1063049	Like, if I've still got tokens at Golf Land, you know, there's a Drum Mania machine there that works on occasion.
1063390	1066012	And when it works, I can pump tokens in and, you know, fuck it up and then leave.
1066877	1075744	I've used up all mine, and now that my car is tested and fixed and everything, I'm going to be heading my butt to Milpitas to play the horsey racing game.
1076665	1086032	Speaking of Golfland and Milpitas Golfland, if you're just joining us, we do have the interviews from Milpitas Tournament that took place on Friday, and we'll get to those a little later when we're ready.
1087213	1087713	Whatever.
1088394	1089154	Let's talk more to Zero.
1090595	1093538	So, are you a PA or a freestyler?
1093918	1094518	Freestyler.
1094538	1094979	I wanted like 50.
1096973	1098494	So what kind of freestyle do you do?
1099134	1100074	Here's the next big question then.
1100114	1101974	Are you an improver or a routiner?
1103595	1106435	I would kind of say more routine than improv.
1106655	1107875	Just because it's stuff I know.
1108015	1112396	I freestyle what you guys all call like 18, like all the old stuff.
1112556	1113757	Oh, you're old school.
1113997	1114317	Yeah.
1114377	1114877	That's cool.
1115097	1116497	So you like to like rate bars?
1116917	1118417	No, I don't touch the bar.
1118818	1119118	Really?
1119178	1120878	How do you do 18 freestyle without touching the bar?
1123405	1127167	See, A-Team is all about the bar and the knees, bro.
1127407	1128427	Bar, knees, and hands.
1128488	1131289	I do knees, I do everything else, but I don't touch the bar.
1131369	1139732	Dude, today I saw Loki doing his XC edit again, and he did the little freeze bit and then dropped his knees down, and you could just see his face just go like, oh, motherfuck.
1139892	1145355	Yeah, it's like my thing, I mean, like when it comes to swinging my knees, my legs over the bar and stuff, I just don't touch the bar when I spin.
1145435	1145835	That's it.
1146015	1146675	Because I hate the bar.
1147256	1148836	The bar is icky and slimy.
1149296	1150377	Because everyone else does it.
1150859	1160045	I know, and everybody's, like, all sweating because they're playing DR, and then their little mitts are all over the bar, and then they have, like, a lot of bars have those little black padding things on them that just soak up all that crap.
1160065	1161926	I watched a guy wipe his head on those bars.
1162507	1163107	Oh, gross.
1163127	1164668	That's why, I don't, that's the reason I don't touch them.
1165609	1169171	I once put them between my legs and I rode them, and it was good.
1169251	1171232	And that's why we don't touch the bars.
1172053	1173474	I saw someone get nutted on one.
1175255	1177876	We were there for that, when Rick flipped Timmy.
1177896	1178257	Oh, yeah.
1180054	1183317	I got that nickname for Roseville Golf Land, by the way, from 23 Magus.
1183357	1185718	He's calling it Runny Venereal Goo Land.
1186799	1187480	That was pretty good.
1190182	1190822	Yeah, haha.
1191183	1191883	We're so mature.
1193104	1193945	Did you hear that one, Jamie?
1194585	1195646	Runny Venereal Goo Land.
1198709	1202511	That made me smile.
1203612	1208056	USFVB, I have to ask a question to this, because this is kind of a running question about freestyle on the show.
1208846	1214591	Zero, why is it that throughout all the routines that we've seen, nobody ever whips their cock out at the end?
1215732	1219295	I think somebody would probably call the police or something if you get kicked out.
1220015	1224259	You know, it's a whole thing of the pants you wear to DDR just don't come down so quickly.
1224579	1226681	If they came down quickly, you'd fall over yourself.
1226821	1227242	I don't know.
1227282	1229063	Depending on the cock, I'd give them a high score.
1230404	1231585	That's probably why most people don't do it.
1231605	1234848	You know, there's a lot of people who say that there's a lot of gay people in the DDR community.
1234868	1235669	This is probably why.
1240659	1247981	If there's girls that can get up there and push their boobs together and call it a routine, then you know.
1248441	1249161	Last message.
1254163	1258204	That was all inspired because the OSFBB was suggesting that someone could whip their cock out and rub it on the bar.
1258884	1259724	That would be sick.
1260064	1261084	That would be bar raping.
1261185	1262605	Another reason you don't touch the bar.
1263345	1265145	Oh my god, that's so true.
1265165	1267846	I have little mini bars running around soon.
1268446	1270186	But, damn, dude.
1270866	1279808	Wouldn't it be funny if somebody got up there to do a routine and then, like, you know, whipped out, like, a cooler with all this liquor in it and said, look, I'm holding on to the bar.
1281808	1282469	That was interesting.
1282489	1282849	The bar?
1283629	1284509	Yes, I get it.
1286276	1287537	That's when you hit gongs.
1292798	1294859	I want to do an episode of Orange Lounge with a gong.
1296299	1298780	Dude, we would be fucking whacking that thing left and right.
1300601	1301681	No little gong either.
1301741	1305502	I want to wheel a giant gong in here and put it in the back.
1306683	1307983	We actually have one at our work.
1308083	1311524	Every time someone gets a new customer, they hit the gong.
1311664	1312444	I kid you not.
1312664	1314125	You can talk on the phone and it's sitting in your ears.
1316158	1316558	What was that?
1316578	1317799	What are you talking about?
1317819	1318439	I didn't hear anything.
1318979	1319620	It's hilarious.
1320560	1329004	Speaking of which, tonight I'm going to be uploading a few pictures from Orange Lounge Radio because of the fact that I've got my digital camera here and I've got a website that was given to me nicely enough.
1329284	1331125	Why don't you whore out that site?
1331205	1332766	Not yet because it's not up yet.
1334147	1337068	I'll let you guys know by next week when all my shit is up and ready.
1338029	1341750	I believe Jamie is pulling her eye down and sticking her tongue at me in the Anime Girl fashion.
1341770	1342731	I'm not sure why, though.
1346897	1350798	Yeah, I'll get around to mine when I get around to mine.
1350818	1352739	No more deadlines.
1353079	1357921	I don't like being imposed, you know, all these deadlines enforced on me.
1358381	1359922	They'll come up whenever, you know.
1359942	1366505	But yeah, I'm going to take like a handful of pictures because I've been taking pictures for my whole birthday weekend in Chitton, so I figure if I grab a few from here, I'll stick them on there.
1367786	1371228	Besides, what was I going to ask?
1371408	1377452	We've been getting a lot of listeners through that Leech from Loki site, so where are you advertising that site besides this show?
1377732	1379553	Because you're already getting a lot of hits, apparently.
1380814	1383216	Everyone that emails me goes, why aren't you updating your site?
1383476	1384217	Because there's a new site.
1386030	1388171	Oh, you know what?
1388251	1391513	Did you hear that I started a new sim file, even though I haven't finished the old one?
1391673	1392274	What'd you start?
1392654	1392994	A new one.
1393014	1394175	I'm not going to tell you what song.
1394735	1397257	But, you know, I'll tell you what song off air.
1397317	1401579	Well, obviously the listeners will know later on, but I did a remix today.
1402280	1403421	Ah, yes, we're going to hear that, huh?
1403701	1404681	Yes.
1404841	1406703	And there might be a wicked sim file to go with that.
1409704	1411205	Well, you'll have to listen to it.
1412546	1413867	You'll find out, won't you, little boy?
1415495	1417215	Yeah, okay.
1417756	1419556	Hey, why don't you give us a sim update, Loki?
1420596	1422877	Well, I wish there was something to update on.
1423477	1424817	There really isn't much going on.
1424837	1425778	Let's see here.
1425838	1428138	BomaniStyle, DJ Paranoia's taking a break.
1428158	1431599	I'm putting up the DDR Extreme files because he's tired.
1432139	1433099	I can understand that.
1434220	1434440	What?
1435260	1438441	Do you know what happened to the DDR Extreme files that were on BomaniStyle?
1438461	1438901	They're gone.
1440071	1445254	They're re-uploading them with backgrounds and sync steps and full steps and that kind of thing.
1446175	1451818	But if you're looking for DDR Extreme stuff, there's some people are uploading stuff to BimaniSims.com.
1451838	1452839	You can find stuff there.
1453879	1459623	It's kind of like another site that was doing the exact same thing as I was doing, which is going to have people being able to upload their own files.
1459643	1463405	Of course, it's kind of very basic, and they just have a CGI script, which you can do stuff.
1463585	1468008	Of course, I'm going to be making full, beautiful web pages as soon as I get my site up.
1469486	1470807	Sure you are.
1472447	1473007	I am.
1473107	1478389	I'm just working on downloading, uh, er, I'm working on sorting 2,000 files, you know.
1478569	1479630	It's kind of difficult.
1480150	1487253	Simply, you just put them in, um, alphabetic order by, um, game and song and artist and... No, it's not gonna work.
1487373	1489674	...and BPM and... What did you do?
1490694	1496196	Jamie's been taking random pics with my digicam, and from... She... Oh, my God, she's doing the dancer pose.
1496256	1496876	It's so... Hey.
1497256	1498157	Ha ha ha.
1500323	1501524	Hey, that's not a bad picture.
1501564	1502044	That's pretty good.
1502084	1503365	There's some cool stuff I got.
1504226	1506888	Like, last night I got the Axifoli Techno theme.
1506908	1509629	That was kind of funny.
1509810	1510070	DWI 2.40?
1511170	1511731	Did that come out?
1512233	1516275	Well, it might have, but I don't use DWI anymore, so that means nothing to me.
1516695	1516955	Oh, okay.
1516995	1521037	But for those who do, there's, like, been new DWI versions coming out.
1521057	1528941	There's actually some... Actually, DWI now supports Winamp plugins, I believe, for, you know, visualizations and that kind of shit.
1529361	1530441	So that's out.
1530481	1534223	Plus, you know, they've been supporting, you know, lyrics for a while, which is kind of cool.
1534543	1535704	Then there's going to be the new version...
1536724	1540447	There's going to be the new Step Mania that they're working on right now.
1540487	1543850	It's going to be supporting what's done in QDX and Beatmania.
1544971	1548313	Dude, if you haven't played Be Lovin' on Xtreme, you've got to play it.
1548454	1549755	Greatest fucking song ever.
1549955	1552817	Oh my god, play Be Lovin' at the commercial break.
1552837	1554238	You have to play Be Lovin' at the commercial break.
1554258	1554559	Come on.
1555059	1557141	Oh my god, it's on Beatmania fucking 7th Mix.
1558382	1558902	OST.
1559923	1560663	Greatest song ever.
1561264	1561884	It seriously is.
1562085	1562605	You have to play it.
1562625	1563166	Like, play it now.
1564486	1566927	Oh, dude, I played Little Bitch's Oni Steps today.
1567447	1568267	They're hella fun.
1568347	1570767	I was, like, surprised that they were actually really well done.
1571527	1576108	I mean, all of the Oni Steps were, like, these stupid gay songs, like... I'm sorry, not gay songs.
1576368	1582089	Rather, these old songs from DDR First Mix, and they're... The Butterfly Oni Steps are pretty cool-looking.
1582149	1584070	The Little Bitch Oni Steps are cool.
1584690	1586370	The Dom Deer Rom Oni Steps are cool.
1586390	1588671	They're not... There are no Oni Steps for Dom Deer Rom.
1588691	1590611	Okay, well, the Dom Deer Rom video is cool.
1592091	1596434	But it's amazing these old school songs that they put Onis to and shit like that.
1596674	1598635	No, it's because they fucked up the other steps the first time.
1598735	1599355	Well, no, dude.
1599375	1601377	Butterfly Basic is still one of the best ever.
1603298	1604418	Is something like Beat on Extreme?
1605719	1606019	Uh, no.
1606359	1606640	Shit.
1607000	1609401	What about, uh... Anyways, so, um... Yeah...
1616702	1620525	Um, there's a, yeah, um, let's see here, what else?
1620745	1628912	Oh yeah, DWI Insanity, I think I mentioned this last week, um, they've got Easy to Dancer, um, sim files now, or they're DWIs for Easy to Dancer songs.
1629372	1631093	So, check those out, um.
1632594	1632815	Ternimix 3
1662474	1662835	And now?
1663315	1668178	Yeah, and the really crappy DDR extreme skins for Step Mania.
1668659	1672041	I mean, it's alright, but I think the one for DWI looked much better.
1672421	1678706	One problem with Step Mania is, instead of saying Perfects and Greats, it says Hi Guys and Bye Guys, and all this crap like that.
1679646	1680707	It is so horrible.
1680907	1682548	I laughed for a month on just one.
1682608	1684529	It's the skin thing.
1684910	1689052	You're going to hear about this during the interviews because we talked to some of the folks from Killer Pals.
1689072	1691434	That's their whole little in-joke.
1691574	1693955	See, the thing is, that can be easily fixed.
1694476	1700339	Actually, I'm still playing off of the SM Max 2 skin because that's my favorite one so far.
1702401	1704422	And now this kicking of Rob was brought to you by Propel.
1704742	1705062	Hey!
1705583	1705643	Ow!
1707717	1708077	You suck.
1708117	1709438	They had ass-flavored Propel.
1709738	1710899	Damn it, we should give the fuck you some.
1710939	1712580	Why do they have ass-flavored Propel?
1712880	1713200	Lemon.
1714301	1716902	That's all they had at Walgreens earlier today was lemon.
1717102	1717403	Blech.
1718623	1719604	Well, it's not that bad.
1719644	1720685	I spit on lemon.
1720745	1720965	Blech.
1723852	1725213	Okay, you want to do FUs of the week?
1725273	1725593	Yes!
1725694	1728436	Alright, we'll take a break and then do FUs.
1728456	1728736	How's that?
1728756	1729997	Alright, we're going to take a break.
1730017	1731358	We'll come back and do the FUs of the week.
1731398	1739064	So you can send those to me over private message in the chat room or to our email, orangelounge.radio.yahoo.com And if you're not in our chat room, why the hell aren't you?
1739124	1750453	Get over to our website, http://orangelounge.skie.cx And after the FUs of the week, we'll think about doing those Mopedus interviews.
1750513	1751154	How's that sound?
1751814	1752755	We will be right back.
1754557	1761728	By request from Tal, because he's such a baby, we're going to hear Be Lovin'.
1762129	1763952	Fuck, fuck, fuck.
1764192	1765034	And Daikin Kai.
1765374	1766195	All right, we'll be back.
1766215	1766556	Fuck.
1851520	1852121	DJ Ranma S
1875580	1876481	Thank you for watching!
1902637	1904139	Thank you for watching!
1929202	1930183	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1980092	1980695	Thanks for watching!
2048860	2050461	Hi, this is Mel B of RTF.
2050821	2055723	And for an extra $1.99 a minute, my girlfriend Mel B can join us on all the fun together.
2056583	2062386	Hey, if you're a broke ass like I am, why don't you come to the one place that costs absolutely nothing to go to and still the fun is just as great.
2062726	2064607	It's Orange Lounge Radio, Sunday nights.
2065187	2069549	Kick it with me and you just might realize the best things in life are free.
2071670	2081756	Hi, you're listening to Orange Lounge Radio, and I need some folks to fill time while I fix the chat, because we've bumped out of the chat room during that break, so hold on just one sec, I've got to get us back in.
2082957	2084998	If anyone can talk, I'd be you.
2085938	2086539	Of course I can.
2087880	2093783	We were in the car today and talking about live journals, and Black Lab got me on his friend list for some reason, and I was like, how did you not get on your friend list?
2093843	2095164	And Somnia was like,
2095669	2098391	Well, Tal, it's not like you ever update your live journal anyways.
2098431	2102754	I mean, no one talks... When you update, it's like, oh my god, you updated for the first time.
2102814	2108358	Being, of course, facetious, given how much I update, especially my, what is it, verbal vomit lately.
2109739	2111440	Your post is starting to look like mine.
2112361	2114322	Well, I've had a bad week, okay?
2114602	2116083	I'm not normally angst-bubbled.
2116183	2117344	It's Triforce.
2117404	2118685	Isn't that a cool Triforce?
2118705	2119706	My uncle made it for me in India.
2119746	2120546	It's like that silver and stuff.
2120567	2120887	I'll think of it.
2120907	2121967	You can't pick them up and post it later.
2122308	2122488	Okay.
2123211	2125514	So yes, are we still filling time for you?
2125634	2140110	Oh, it like bombed out quite some time ago, but we cut out the chat room we pinged out of during the break, so we got kind of screwed up there, so we're back now though, but you can reset your FUs to us if you're in the chat room.
2140470	2140670	Yeah.
2141190	2143411	So, send those FUs to me over private message.
2143451	2146412	And if you sent it while I was gone, obviously I didn't get them.
2146452	2150933	So, I only have FUs from Stress 23 Magus, Dark Tetsuya, and DCB at this point.
2150953	2155094	So, if you're not on that list, send them to me over IRC or... Email.
2155314	2156835	Email, orangeontheradio at yahoo.com.
2157415	2157615	So...
2160033	2161133	I say we go ahead and get started.
2161153	2161333	Alright.
2161713	2162654	We're going to do TerraMix.
2163094	2164334	Alright, you want TerraMix this week?
2164354	2164414	Yes.
2164574	2165674	Alright, we're going to do the FUs of the Week.
2166074	2176136	Since we have some new listeners tonight, because earlier today I spammed the DDR Live Journal community, so I know we're going to have some new listeners tonight to explain what the FUs of the Week is all about.
2176156	2179917	This is where we get angsty, bitchy, and we tell you all about it.
2180477	2183157	But you get to participate too, but you don't get to say it yourself.
2183177	2185138	We do, because we have a microphone, and therefore the power.
2185458	2185638	Yes.
2186038	2186478	Very well.
2186518	2187038	Very well put.
2188112	2190895	But this is, um, just start it.
2190975	2191635	They'll figure it out.
2191775	2192616	Alright, here we go.
2192736	2194037	Because they're a complete moron.
2194618	2196219	Starting with the one and only.
2196299	2197160	We're not morons.
2197220	2198522	If you're listening to us, you're not a moron.
2206489	2207670	This is fucked up.
2208457	2211339	I always have to wait for that, that's crazy.
2211359	2231470	Um, anyway, my first fuck you of the week goes toward Walgreens, so not having berries, or peach-flavored Propel, and having only lemon, which is the ass of all flavors of Propel, although not that bad, because it's still propel, and everyone can see, it's not the best, so, ass is ass, and that certainly is the butt track.
2232071	2232131	Um,
2233997	2241319	My other Fuck Me of the Week goes to this ugly bitch that was driving behind me yesterday when I was following Jabberwocky running errands.
2241619	2245860	Dude, DarkSakura goes psychotic in the car.
2245920	2246561	It is awesome.
2246901	2256143	In the two minutes I was in there, I was just like, wow, waiting for the, you know, big, hella hard level 3 super to come out and turn us all into ash.
2256163	2258124	But the light went forward, something, something, something.
2258704	2262047	You know her... The Dark Sakura Super!
2263388	2264449	The Haruka Super.
2264489	2264809	Yes.
2266270	2268592	Yeah, and it just kicks your ass seven ways from Sunday.
2268632	2270093	Hey, I'm trying to be angsty here!
2270113	2270674	Gimme that!
2271254	2272636	Ooh, two microphones!
2273256	2273536	Ah!
2273616	2279841	Um, a fuck you goes toward, um... Bullshit.
2280062	2283364	I don't know what else to... Oh yeah, I was talking about the ugly bitch behind me.
2283384	2283584	Okay.
2285979	2286600	No, not you.
2286620	2287960	You were here.
2288041	2293624	Anyway, I'm trying to keep following distance, you know, which is how you are supposed to drive.
2294345	2298467	By law, you have to keep a three-second following distance line.
2298808	2301369	This woman, every time I stop, she's right up on my bumper.
2301409	2303531	And I always leave, you know, about a foot...
2304111	2306012	Welcome to California.
2306032	2306813	Here's your license.
2307273	2308954	She was fucking ugly, though.
2309254	2311355	And I would look in my rearview mirror and there'd be this face.
2312276	2315718	Okay, and me, normally, I'm not one to say about how people look.
2315778	2317059	I'm normally not that superficial.
2317599	2318820	I don't care how big somebody is.
2318900	2320661	I don't care what they look like.
2320721	2323643	The chicken last message looked like a horse.
2324163	2326124	But I am not superficial like that.
2326604	2328305	But I'm sorry, this woman scared me.
2328325	2329346	She had this epic condition.
2333269	2339476	She looked like a... A skin condition or like missing a nose condition or what?
2339496	2340698	She looked like a rhinoceros.
2341078	2346584	She had these folds of skin where skin should not have folds.
2346945	2349288	And then her eyes were shrunken deep into her head.
2351245	2362295	and like her eyes looked swollen and then she had like really ugly hair that was like really curly and she would bump my car so finally I hit a stop sign and I just stayed there I stayed there for three minutes
2371445	2372386	and I didn't let her go.
2373066	2376890	She was starting to turn, I would just ignore it and then she turned.
2376950	2386377	So then I went on my way and eventually the bitch turned and someone got in the way and I was like, and then this other ugly person got behind me.
2386397	2389860	She was almost as scary, but not quite as bad, but she was just the baddest driver.
2390100	2391161	Oh my god, I hate people here.
2391181	2392002	Not really hate everybody.
2392062	2393943	And then... You're not supposed to, it's my fucking use.
2402679	2403059	Is that it?
2403079	2403700	Or do you have more?
2404740	2414527	I had another one, but just remembering that woman's face sort of gave me an involuntary lobotomy.
2414587	2420811	Not actually having the front lip of my brain broken, but just having it written in art.
2421972	2422653	Alright, moving on.
2422673	2425595	And by the way, you can look up inert at www.gardenationary.com.
2425635	2426535	It's spelled I-N-E-R-T-I-N-T.
2430314	2431295	I, N, E, what?
2431495	2435037	Moving on, next FB of the week.
2435097	2435958	Loki, let's hear it.
2445911	2447332	Okay, first F.E.
2447412	2450495	of the week goes to the stupid news coverage of the space shuttle.
2450575	2453057	Listen, to be honest, you're dumbass.
2453337	2460083	So, some retard that was building the space shuttle forgot to put a freaking heat-sensitive tile on the wing.
2460523	2463426	And that, oh, I guess caused the shuttle to burn up at Mach 18.
2463726	2466829	Not to mention that the Columbia is the oldest space shuttle.
2466909	2467829	It was in operation...
2468910	2469530	It doesn't matter.
2469811	2471611	They're going- 20 fucking years old.
2471631	2473292	That thing should not be retrofitted.
2473752	2474993	It shouldn't be ins- SHUT UP!
2475233	2475913	I'M TALKING!
2476313	2476853	Not you!
2477253	2477814	I'm talking.
2478674	2480095	I'm more important than you are.
2480335	2481695	Stop talking.
2482155	2482476	Anyway.
2483496	2486157	Anyway, so, um, yeah, what do they not know?
2486357	2487578	It was actually Al-Qaeda.
2487598	2488298	They sent a CAC.
2488578	2494139	The people that I felt bad for were the people who were actually involved with it, like NASA, the government, the families.
2516025	2518826	and the friends that I had, the friend I had who saw it happen.
2519906	2521707	Anyway... And my cousin who knew them all.
2522347	2526328	Well, don't care, okay, anyways... Hold on, so, uh... I feel bad for the government.
2528008	2530409	LET ME FINISH, GODDAMNIT, OR YOU'RE GONNA BE ADDED TO THE LIST!
2530429	2533590	You're gonna have to pay for this, and it's gonna come out of our pocket.
2534230	2539771	Okay, anyways, so the shuttle sucked, people burned up and are dead, and they're looking for the remains over three states.
2540111	2540671	So you know what?
2541012	2542552	I say hooray for human failure.
2544622	2548123	Now, second one on the list is... Can you address those cards and letters to Loki?
2548143	2551724	The second one on the list is kind of related, is Yahoo News.
2552484	2554184	I like to call them Captain Obvious.
2555184	2559365	Okay, they're like, the headline's all, The trouble started on the left wing.
2559425	2564486	Yeah, they've been saying that ever since the stupid thing blew up, we had censor failure in the left wing.
2564766	2566687	Maybe the trouble started on the left wing?
2567807	2568867	Yahoo is ruder.
2569727	2572708	It's a British news reporter.
2573840	2575260	It doesn't matter, they still suck.
2575340	2580062	It doesn't matter, they still suck.
2580082	2584403	They're still covering people that are getting hurt imitating jackass stuff.
2584563	2587624	Even though the show's been off the TV for like, you know, over a year now.
2588004	2593986	So... Yeah, and the commercials where they have just the freaks down there.
2594006	2595206	So, screw Yahoo.
2596062	2597943	Um, let's see, what else here?
2598003	2599423	I know there was something else.
2600004	2600804	Um, oh yeah!
2601424	2603265	Um, American Idol Rejects.
2604365	2618250	Okay, listen you people, I don't know why hundreds and thousands of you, you know, thought you could sing, or, I don't even know why you, I don't know, your parents decided to breed, because you're like some of the weirdest inbred freaks I've ever seen.
2618570	2622572	And like the guy that was quote-unquote the worst- Like a bad guy.
2622612	2622732	Yes.
2623152	2630048	Cut for the very first time Okay, now I'm sure you're more on key than you were probably
2633436	2640101	Anyway, I'm sure that, you know, at the time, the freak experiment with the cow and pig genes brought together to make some weird human.
2640641	2654472	Thought it might have been a good idea at the time, but no it wasn't, and you really suck, and I'm also sick and tired of the secret people that are whining because they're like, I partied and I can't sing now, I'm famous already!
2655422	2656863	I'm gonna be famous no matter what!
2657123	2658283	Alright, enough of that.
2658303	2662245	Now we're gonna go back to the reoccurring FDU of stupid drivers.
2692342	2699554	Listen, old people should not drive cars, let alone large vans coming towards me.
2700461	2703484	Listen, when you're turning, you're not supposed to turn into the oncoming traffic.
2703604	2706606	You're supposed to turn into, you know, traffic going the same way.
2707227	2709629	So, I don't like you looking at me and all of a sudden, Oh!
2709729	2711570	I'm not supposed to turn in that lane where there's a car!
2712611	2713072	But yeah.
2713912	2719857	So, yeah, and F you for me missing, uh, stupid, uh, raffle in Animal Crossing.
2719877	2722259	My girlfriend, she was part of my game.
2727085	2727486	My turn?
2727546	2727927	My turn?
2728288	2728529	Yeah.
2728689	2729231	Alright, yay.
2729872	2732680	As of this week, I have a new FU theme.
2733342	2735267	I've ditched Bakwa for something much better.
2737142	2740004	Dancer, ladies and gentlemen, is my new FU, because I love this song.
2740225	2741385	And actually, Tal suggested it.
2741646	2743367	Dude, this song is like the fucking shit.
2743887	2752234	I mean, my uber-goth industrial head roommate sits there and like, oh my god, if DDR had more songs like this instead of that fucking poppy shit, I'd play it all day and night.
2752394	2753535	Anyway, can I get my FUs?
2753555	2754176	Thank you.
2754216	2755777	My FUs are actually Bomani-related.
2755857	2760521	Well, I have one Bomani-related FU, because coming back from the Milpitas tournament, which we'll get to the coverage of in a little bit...
2762799	2766308	whoever built that merge where 680 and 80 meet
2768523	2769604	Fuck you!
2770284	2781388	Whoever designed that a two-lane freeway should have to merge three times to get back on the 80, causing traffic to back up for like five miles, you're a cunt, and I don't like you.
2781608	2789251	Dude, you take the fucking exit that takes you by South Scandia to the A if you want, you can stop there, but B, you can get back off the highway and skip that whole thing.
2789271	2790192	This is the problem, Tal.
2790632	2793233	Everybody knows about that, so it's not much better.
2794293	2795454	That is true.
2796335	2799417	Anyway, so F whoever built that.
2799797	2800317	Puppies!
2800337	2803019	Why aren't you playing Animal Crossing?
2803860	2806141	Oh, because you're coming to do the FUs?
2806262	2807022	Oh, you okay, Ryan?
2807042	2809464	F Ryan for ruining my chair?
2814051	2816112	I'm putting you back in the closet where you belong, Ryan.
2818492	2822013	I have more FUs, I'm trying to think of them.
2822153	2830155	F Tom Nook, because he was giving away crappy shit in the Animal Crossing raffle yesterday.
2830175	2831796	F people who don't like Animal Crossing.
2833476	2834397	Starting with Tao.
2835557	2837578	Rob, Rob, it's called fuck.
2837598	2838798	Say it with me.
2842438	2842718	Fuck you!
2842738	2845963	That's the fact that I still can't get a date.
2845983	2846383	That sucks.
2846444	2846664	Fuck that!
2857230	2858631	Fuck that no one will fuck me.
2859351	2860131	Fuck that.
2860772	2861552	All right, I'm done.
2861932	2862372	Dude.
2863093	2865314	All right, Tal, you have so much to say.
2865394	2865774	Let's hear it.
2865814	2866474	Actually, you know what?
2866534	2872177	I don't really need to give an F you because I can just sit and rant on my live journal and people can not read it because I post so much.
2872657	2875759	You know, F my fucking nature to talk so goddamn much.
2875799	2877320	It gets so annoying to other people, doesn't it?
2877660	2877860	Fuck.
2878580	2879621	Fuck that shit, man.
2879942	2884425	No, F the fucking Counter-Strike guy for fucking... Fuck that shit, man.
2885146	2887328	But yeah, you guys have all heard the Counter-Strike song, right?
2887408	2889470	Where the dude is like, being blacked by his buddy.
2889770	2890931	Uh, we're gonna hear it later.
2891191	2892112	Greatest song ever.
2893193	2894815	It's my cage match pick for tonight.
2897777	2898578	Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.
2898598	2900379	I just made up music.
2900399	2900459	Yes.
2926095	2927696	Fuck the F letter in the opposite.
2928797	2933541	Fuck the Daredevil movie for being gay.
2933581	2939585	Fuck them for having a cracker-ass Elektra.
2939905	2948412	You know the only thing that would make that movie cool is if they had chemistry fighting.
2949577	2953739	Because Kevin Smith can take any piece of crap and make it cool.
2953759	2956040	Like Scary Movie 3, which is happening, by the way.
2956060	2959302	I thought they already did that.
2959462	2962203	Didn't they do, like... Oh!
2963063	2967245	Oh, no, it was Scream 3 that had Jay and Tyler Bob in it.
2967345	2969106	Oops.
2970307	2972368	As I said, Scream 3 had Jay and Tyler Bob.
2972468	2974729	Yes, they were in the background.
2974749	2975549	I hate Jay and Tyler Bob.
2978646	2980787	Great, who's gonna talk now?
3001832	3004374	Well, I'm sure you'll figure out some way to fill three hours.
3004794	3005494	Bye, Tal.
3005714	3006495	Thanks for coming.
3006635	3007195	Happy birthday.
3007395	3008676	Everybody sing to Tal.
3009237	3012299	Happy birthday, fuck you.
3012859	3015781	Happy birthday, fuck you.
3016301	3019843	Happy birthday, fuck you, Tal.
3020624	3021164	Fuck you, too.
3021204	3024106	Happy birthday, fuck you.
3024126	3024926	All right, get out.
3026067	3028649	Oh, yes, and I do expect presents on my birthday, just so you know.
3029932	3031433	Bitch, you're getting all this shit for free.
3031493	3031833	All right.
3031853	3033094	Here we go.
3033114	3035134	Yeah, it's the thought that counts.
3035975	3036755	Moving along.
3037376	3039717	Let's get to Black Lab because I have this song queued up already.
3039797	3043158	So you have any, I'm sure, need I ask if Puppy has any FUs of the week?
3043899	3045299	Oh, yes, you don't need to ask me.
3045399	3045799	Let's see.
3045900	3046580	First of all...
3047759	3064771	A big, large FUCK YOU to that damn ECS project that I had to do this week because I was working on that shit probably a good 36 to 40 hours straight and I still did not get it done before the deadline.
3065071	3068454	I got help from a bunch of people and I still could not get it done.
3068794	3074358	And it just would not fucking work and I was ready to freaking put a knife to my throat because it was that fucking bad.
3075450	3078011	And then, yeah, then I slept in that.
3078051	3080332	Just make sure if you're going to slit your wrist, go with the vein.
3080352	3083594	So many people do it against it, and that's not the way you do it.
3083614	3086575	When you cut more... Anyway, yeah, anyway, sorry.
3087596	3090517	We don't want Puppy to kill himself.
3090537	3091898	Well, let's see.
3091918	3100002	Actually, it was from the craft, so... Fuck sudden hailstorms, because I was... Yesterday...
3101454	3105715	Loki, shut up, I'm trying to talk.
3106035	3109636	You're distracting me.
3109756	3111337	I'm still trying to continue.
3111377	3112917	You want to talk about suicide.
3115117	3116798	Go kill yourself and I'll take over the show.
3117398	3118738	Happy?
3119639	3123320	Come here.
3123340	3123840	No, thank you.
3128133	3128913	I can run.
3128993	3130494	I'm creeping closer.
3130534	3132574	He's just gonna kick me, I know that.
3132614	3133735	No, I'm not gonna kick you.
3133815	3134175	Okay.
3134235	3135055	Down, boy.
3135135	3136735	Look at my hat!
3136795	3136835	No!
3136856	3136936	No!
3136956	3137416	Not my hat!
3137436	3138936	Okay, I have... No, don't get it!
3157245	3161687	Kid Puppyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
3179281	3180562	Yeah, it fucking hurt!
3181142	3183603	I had to bail underneath a gas station.
3183623	3185524	That looks like why you call Mike Tyson's a sissy.
3185544	3185684	What?
3185884	3187304	Is that why you look like a sissy?
3187344	3188465	Oh, that's why you call him a sissy.
3188485	3188625	What?
3188725	3190846	I don't have... What was I just talking about?
3190866	3192847	I have absolutely no clue what she was talking about.
3192927	3194207	Is there a door?
3194807	3195167	I'm a nerd.
3205659	3220191	Alright, I just got a couple quick ones.
3220431	3223994	Number one, fuck you to my DVD player for not letting me play Vulgar.
3224014	3228657	I have been waiting forever to get a hold of that DVD and my DVD player has died.
3229298	3232661	Another one, fuck you to Evil once again who can't drive.
3233673	3241820	I'm on my way walking here, and a guy can't wait long enough for me to cross the road, so he comes in like inches for trying to kill me, because, you know, he's brilliant at everything.
3241900	3243501	He's some little ghetto boy or whatever.
3244362	3249306	And another one, fuck you to all the jocks who have to make fun of everybody who plays DDR.
3249326	3250607	I'm really getting sick and tired of it.
3251207	3252468	That's when you kicked him in the balls.
3252488	3253189	You brought me balls!
3275663	3276283	That's all I got.
3276343	3277504	No, that's what you do.
3278264	3281926	It's handy that you freaking tell them what happened and they will throw their ass out.
3282006	3283267	It's handy that they will.
3283627	3287649	Jonas just got here, so we're going to go ahead and let him do FUs because he brought balls.
3288289	3290130	Jonas, you've got to keep it quick this week.
3290590	3291750	I've never had balls.
3291770	3294412	I have to say, sorry for anybody who wants to hear any more FUs.
3294452	3295692	I don't have any today.
3296453	3296733	What?
3297453	3298474	You mean you're in a good mood?
3298514	3299174	What's this about?
3304023	3305124	Thank you for the balls, we appreciate it.
3305144	3305604	Oh shit, here we go.
3305624	3311449	Well, since I missed the deadline, fuck's cool for costing me to get the whole bunch of delays.
3312190	3315632	I'll put them in the header for my content of the contest.
3322268	3322829	And it doesn't.
3323249	3324030	But I missed it.
3324050	3324630	Yeah.
3325091	3327273	But I missed the deadline.
3327553	3327753	Nope.
3328254	3328514	Alright.
3328914	3329935	Chatroom FUs time.
3329975	3330356	Here we go.
3330476	3336341	I'm going to run through these really fast because I've seen... There's more chatroom FUs tonight than I've ever seen before.
3336422	3337463	So we've got to run through these.
3337523	3338083	Alright, kids.
3338123	3338584	Here we go.
3339384	3339885	Starting off.
3341286	3341927	Oh my god.
3342087	3343308	A continued FU to his ex.
3344629	3346991	Maybe she'd find nothing but sorrow and pain in the arms of others.
3347051	3348292	Yes, my own personal curse there.
3348673	3350975	Next, I want to send an FU to Megan, you little fucking bitch.
3351035	3351515	Die already.
3351635	3353777	Also, I'd like to further the FU with an FU to myself.
3353817	3355158	Fuck me for being so hung up on my ex.
3355198	3355939	Save me, somebody.
3356499	3359202	Fuck balls, because I think it might have been going to hell.
3359662	3359882	Alright.
3361523	3363784	Uh... F you to politicians as a whole.
3363844	3365425	Gray Davis especially deserves to die.
3365485	3371467	Secondly, government headquarters and Saksucks ass, they make things so hard for me to get my job with sudden rule fucking changes.
3371527	3375189	I also wanted to send F you to everyone that thinks what happened yesterday was terrorism.
3375209	3377349	The shuttle was under huge security before and during launch.
3378690	3379890	So, F that.
3383572	3383892	Okay.
3386922	3390343	23rd Magus says, F you to gangster rap fans with no taste in music.
3390403	3392984	I played maybe two tack songs the whole time.
3393324	3394805	Let's review the rules the crowd used.
3395345	3394805	1.
3395385	3399366	If you play anything with a guitar in it, anywhere in the song you get mobbed by gangster rap fans.
3400346	3399366	2.
3400406	3404407	If you play anything with a synthesizer in it, anywhere in the song you get mobbed by gangster rap fans.
3404648	3404407	3.
3404668	3408669	If you play anything without lyrics, you get mobbed by gangster rap fans.
3409469	3410350	Oh, but it gets a lot better.
3410430	3414552	Four, if you play anything done by a white guy, you get mobbed by gangsta rap fans.
3415212	3421496	If you play old school rap, MC Hammer, Sir Mix-a-Lot, you know when rap was good, you get mobbed by gangsta rap fans.
3421796	3425138	Seven, if you play anything without a drum track, everyone mobs you.
3427619	3427919	Anyway.
3429580	3430121	Moving right along.
3430161	3431962	Dark Tetsuya says, fuck being single.
3432562	3432842	Amen.
3434603	3435624	DCB says...
3436474	3445226	Fuck you to EX's Random for making me freestyle to Secret Rendezvous during the Milpitas Tournament.
3445687	3449191	And fuck you to Loki for making fun of Keith from American Idol, says DCV.
3452615	3453817	I'm sorry?
3456580	3463249	I heard, you're going to hear this during the Milpitas Golf Land interviews that we have that we're getting to later, but they all got behind the machine and did a big, like, Shiva Buddha thing.
3464591	3465272	You'll see, you'll see.
3466293	3466594	Alright.
3467775	3470379	The best, though, was Lil B had to do a routine of Butterfly.
3472180	3473120	That owned.
3474141	3475582	Just wait for the video, that's all I got to say.
3476002	3476582	And then Oki.
3476842	3479204	Oki did this whole rejected thing to Lemoria.
3479304	3480345	It was funny.
3480445	3480825	Anyway.
3481785	3482466	Who got first?
3482726	3483927	A guy named JC, I believe.
3485427	3486148	I don't know, I wasn't there.
3486168	3486908	I was playing movie.
3487849	3488889	We'll talk about movies in a bit.
3488909	3490570	Let's finish up FUs.
3490951	3491711	Moving right along.
3491991	3495453	ESFBB says, Fuck you to NASA for ruining Saturday morning cartoons.
3497314	3497715	Word.
3499181	3499721	Here's the thing.
3499841	3501462	I was like, ah, spatial crash.

3524246	3526827	Fuck Smarties for being so addicting.
3526867	3528128	Smarties, Smarties are the shit.
3528368	3529248	The blue ones, especially.
3530989	3531869	They make you bark, Jamie.
3535287	3535667	Whatever.
3536228	3542335	Fuck Bomberman Online for not only being addicting but completely in Japanese which makes playing adventures ten times scarier.
3543156	3546459	Fuck this dude at my school's basketball game who tried to beat up two of my teachers.
3546520	3549503	He definitely should die and yay for GCHS.
3549963	3551065	I second that being single.
3551105	3551425	Fuck you.
3553917	3557721	Skyline, DC505, says, fuck you to Nickel City for not having the other floors open.

3561525	3567111	SnubDisfinoid says, fuck you to the sick fuck who made the extreme dropout edit for making it way too fucking hard.
3567932	3568493	Is that you looking?

3572785	3573785	Fifth Mix at a databank.
3573825	3574285	Fuck that.
3575186	3577527	Fuck you to the people who stole my wallet.
3577587	3582130	I don't know how badly you want a fucking burrito, but I hope that 40 bucks you stole from me buys your own misery.
3582170	3586552	And fuck you to the college board for making the SOT one so fucking boring.
3588813	3589214	Sorry.

3598442	3604404	Arcadian42 says, fuck you to my foot for starting to hurt like a bitch yesterday so much that I couldn't make it to Tal's party at Scandia today.
3604984	3607844	It's okay, because everybody got there like three hours late and there really wasn't a party.
3607884	3608465	We're all here now.
3609285	3611945	SoCalKicks, hey, oh my god, I thought he was dead.
3612026	3614126	He's like alive and listening to the show, hooray.

3618633	3626315	FU to Weekends for being too short, FU to Owen for being a dick the entire week, but made up for it in the weekend, when you do give your head, and FU being broke.
3626696	3633518	I want DMC2, Wind Walker, and other games, but I have no money, plus I have to pay for driver's ed classes, and I have to pay for soccer fair share.

3635718	3643521	VidPala says, FU to the 8Kead server that just dropped me like 30 minutes ago, and MIRC wouldn't tell me, and finally, I'd just like to wish everyone out there a happy Chinese New Year.

3661675	3664196	Balls bottles should be used for porn.
3665917	3666317	Alright.
3666457	3669097	Alright.
3670578	3672618	That brings an end to the FUs of the Week segment.
3673039	3674119	So, how you doing, Jonas?

3685054	3687454	I tried to look over for Scandi, but he wasn't there.
3688034	3689055	He'll be here another show.
3689075	3691395	He was pretty much supposed to be everywhere all weekend.
3691515	3695496	He was supposed to be at Scandi the other day, he was there for like a half hour, and then he was supposed to be there at night and he left.
3695856	3699936	He was, like, he was mostly out with Shane or something, and now I don't know where he is.
3700036	3706958	He was supposed to go home today, but he didn't, because he lives in my house and stuff, but he just, like, he never showed up, so I don't know what he's doing right now.
3706998	3709038	Where is Johnny Dun-Dun-Dun?
3710158	3714100	Gone, John, Johnny, Bombay, whatever you call them.

4059834	4060915	Hey, we're not back just yet.
4060935	4061936	We're going to play one more song.
4062036	4063257	It was by request.
4063297	4064658	Something from the Dance Mania album.
4064678	4065399	This is from Dance Mania 20.
4065499	4066340	It's Faye Wong.
4066600	4067041	You might know her.
4067061	4067842	She did Eyes On Me.
4068222	4069523	But she also did this song.
4069543	4070624	This is a great song from Dance Mania 20.
4070724	4072666	It's Separate Ways here on Orange Lounge Radio.
4211007	4219530	Hiho, Kermit the Frog here, informing you that today's broadcast of Orange Lounge Radio is brought to you by the letter B, the letter A, and the number 59.
4219570	4225611	Can you tell me how to get, how to get to Sesame Street?
4226071	4227312	Hi, everybody.
4227692	4229152	You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
4229192	4229653	We're back.
4229813	4234234	And if you were asking what that song was, that was Separate Ways by Faye Wong from Dance Media 20.
4234274	4234954	Brad's back in the house.
4234974	4235174	What's up?
4235194	4235754	No, that wasn't.
4235834	4237555	That was the Sesame Street song.
4239574	4240915	This is Brad being oblivious.
4241015	4242877	Did you guys do the interviews yet?
4243077	4243858	Balls!
4244759	4245780	Thank you for bringing it up.
4245800	4247441	We're going to start those interviews right now.
4247481	4248943	I'm so glad you asked, Brad.
4249623	4254027	As you may or may not know, on Friday I took an adventure over to... Would you like to feel my balls?
4256089	4257871	Oh, you're stroking Jamie's balls live on air?
4260112	4262534	Can you explain the G-rated version of what balls really are?
4263314	4266997	Because they may not sell balls everywhere, so I need you to explain what balls is.
4267078	4270280	Okay, I've been seeing people with this drink behind, I've been moderately curious.
4270320	4273262	Maybe I should have Jonas plug, because he's the one that really is the master of balls.
4273282	4275084	I used to work at GNC.
4275424	4278947	The drink that has high caffeine and it's very good tasting.
4279047	4284572	Guarana is what they put in all of those ones with ephedra, like in those little natural weight loss things.
4284592	4287494	It's not necessarily caffeine, it's very like caffeine.
4287794	4290036	Dead or Alive Volleyball, best game ever.
4290936	4294338	Actually, it's the game that makes men act like girls.
4295899	4297020	And I explain it this way.
4297220	4302904	Because they have to go shopping and buy accessories and know what their favorite colors are and their favorite foods.
4303384	4305525	And then they give presents to other girls.
4305685	4307427	Borderline dating sim.
4307647	4309268	It's a dating sim for lesbians.
4310408	4311049	Sweet.
4312150	4313891	It makes men act like lesbians.
4314971	4315852	DOA Volleyball.
4316989	4322971	If you like DOA Extreme Beach Volleyball, show the upcoming game that's probably going to come out this year for the Xbox.
4322991	4324492	I think it's called NUDE.
4326293	4327713	I have that BMX XXX game.
4327733	4328693	They sent it to us for free.
4330334	4331354	How's that game anyways?
4332155	4337757	Actually, as a game, it's not that bad, but it's not the best either.
4341232	4349116	Yeah, but we, because Dan manages GameStop, we get all kinds of neat free video games and all kinds of cool swag.
4349816	4355019	Like, you know, I don't know if you saw my keychain, I have a GameCube keychain and a GBA keychain.
4356738	4357678	Lovely Brad, lovely.
4358858	4360419	In case people missed it, Brad belched.
4360699	4360999	Anyway.
4362119	4364540	Alright, are you guys ready to get to the interviews?
4364560	4364680	No.
4364720	4365640	Okay, Jamie.
4366060	4367720	But we get free games every so often.
4368460	4370121	And we get, like, porn games.
4370281	4374202	Alright, you guys ready?
4374782	4375162	Yes.
4375762	4376602	Alright, here we go.
4376742	4379043	We're going to do the Milpitas Golf Land interviews.
4379263	4379783	Enjoy.
4379803	4380123	Yay.
4394693	4400176	Do little buttons in front of you and it's a whip and a hold or something, a bridle, I don't know what that crap is.
4401176	4403157	And you sit there and you whip the hell out of your horse.
4403377	4404598	And if you win, you get really excited.
4404618	4406578	Okay, I don't know what happened at the beginning of that interview.
4406759	4407259	That's weird.
4407299	4408419	It kind of cuts in the middle there.
4408439	4411961	But we're talking to Melody, also known as Shark's Girl, about Derby Owners Club.
4412201	4412701	That's kind of weird.
4412921	4414522	She's explaining what Derby Owners Club is all about.
4414622	4415062	Sorry about that.
4415443	4416403	You say, I want to do it again.
4416843	4418844	And if you lose, you say, I have to do it again because I have to win.
4418944	4419985	And suddenly, you're down $100.
4421428	4423689	I won a race earlier and I nearly wet my pants.
4423729	4424429	I was so excited.
4424709	4425570	Yeah, and you beat me.
4426670	4431492	I'm sorry, but I beat my horse more than I beat you, if that's any consolation.
4432452	4434353	I leave the beating to somebody else.
4435014	4438895	I guess I'll forgive you for that, and I'm just going to leave that comment right alone.
4439115	4439936	You're so kind.
4440256	4442276	Oh, isn't there some DDR thing going on here today, too?
4442577	4443297	A DDR tournament?
4443317	4443697	What's that?
4443757	4445878	Oh, yeah, there's a DDR tournament going on in the other room.
4447310	4448591	Is that why you're here tonight?
4448611	4451093	Are you going to be participating in anything?
4451133	4452394	Are you just here to cheer people on?
4453074	4454175	I'm just kind of here to watch.
4454215	4456637	This time I'm not doing anything.
4456957	4458478	Not going to do that for a little while.
4458538	4463521	But yeah, I just kind of wanted to see what's going on and catch more Xtreme because I still haven't heard many of the songs on it.
4464042	4465162	I think that's pretty much me too.
4465423	4469005	You know, if you listen to Orange Lounge from Monty Music and more, you're going to hear lots of stuff from Xtreme.
4469405	4470386	Wink, wink, nudge, nudge, plug.
4470891	4475594	Well, you know, I kind of have this little thing called a life that really keeps me... Hey!
4475874	4476054	Hey!
4476534	4477615	I don't like where you're going with that, Missy.
4478135	4478915	Okay, well, how about this?
4479035	4481096	I have a really slow freaking connection.
4482117	4482997	Okay, fair enough.
4483958	4484878	Fine, be that way.
4485139	4486039	Fine, we understand.
4486659	4487540	I don't want to talk to you no more.
4487580	4489261	Let's talk to this person sitting across the table.
4489541	4489961	Say hello.
4490321	4490782	Hi.
4491162	4491882	What's your name?
4492342	4492943	Uh, Ron.
4493583	4495284	And do you have an online name that you buy?
4495304	4496224	Uke Bondage Boy.
4496885	4497365	Right on.
4497565	4499106	What brings you to today's lovely tournament?
4499881	4501683	Being cheerleader for my aniki.
4502523	4502924	Right on.
4502984	4504445	So you're not going to be participating?
4504485	4507287	Are you going to get up there and actually cheerlead while there's a routine going on?
4507727	4508008	No.
4509189	4511050	Do you think Parapara is anything like cheerleading?
4512051	4512972	Somewhat, yeah.
4513752	4514533	Do you own any boots?
4515834	4516194	Boots?
4516514	4519016	Yeah, you know, like Parapara boots, the big silver boots that come up to your knees?
4519497	4521899	No, I have big black boots with lots of buckles.
4522359	4522900	That's where you go.
4523000	4524081	Oh, hence the name Bondage.
4524721	4524981	Yep.
4525502	4527163	So why do you go by Bondage Boy?
4527363	4528264	Is it just, you like...
4529336	4535681	It was actually a joke because most people when I talk to them online, I don't tell them that I'm female right away.
4535701	4542086	Because a lot of Yaoi fans are female and they're all into the whole female-female relationship.
4542146	4544648	So I don't need any extra baggage like that.
4545409	4546510	So you're into the Yaoi, huh?
4546930	4547351	Oh, yes.
4547711	4549712	So is the lovely Jamie who couldn't be here tonight.
4549732	4552074	I'm sure you two could talk about Yaoi all night long.
4552695	4553455	We often do.
4553836	4554196	Right on.
4554316	4554857	Yes, yes.
4555677	4556518	What's your favorite Yaoi?
4557556	4559757	Um, I don't have a favorite right now.
4559817	4566319	I'm like really into Xenogears because I just started playing it and Initial D. Initial D. Cool.
4566339	4569520	What if they did like Initial D Yaoi that's like kind of role playing?
4569540	4570500	Would that be like the shit?
4571080	4572581	Oh, I already kind of do that.
4573121	4573881	Oh, right on.
4573941	4574261	Cool.
4574841	4576962	Well, anything else you want to say to lovely listeners of Orange Launch Radio?
4578439	4580100	Have fun listening.
4580380	4581100	I can't listen.
4581380	4582900	My computer doesn't like streaming.
4583580	4584240	That's okay.
4584300	4584821	We forgive you.
4584961	4585761	But thanks for being on the show.
4586161	4586801	Not a problem.
4587181	4587481	Cool.
4588001	4591382	Also joining us, we're joined by a few good men here at the table.
4591742	4592662	Say hello, everybody.
4593082	4595003	I hope he doesn't mind me shoving the microphone in his face.
4595083	4597143	It's Mr. Wendell.
4598643	4600664	You just say that so erotically.
4602024	4603464	I was coming off a yaoi high.
4603484	4603885	What can I say?
4603905	4604705	I said coming.
4608322	4609564	You make my nipples so hard now.
4612470	4614614	So are you going to be participating in today's tournament?
4615356	4616758	I will participate...
4617894	4621816	I'll be it, not necessarily be all that great, but hey, hey, that rhymed.
4622917	4625718	Yeah, I'll enter improv freestyle just for the heck of it, you know.
4626298	4627039	I'm sure it'll be fun.
4627599	4632842	Now, how do you approach improv freestyle as opposed to routine freestyle, with the obvious exception of you don't really plan in advance?
4632862	4634623	Do you go in a different mindset when you get there?
4635863	4638465	You never really know what song you're going to get.
4638605	4642447	You just got to go with what you got, try to do what you can.
4642467	4644408	Let's hear that comment for the listeners.
4648450	4649211	I fuckin' forgot.
4649972	4650753	And who are you, good sir?
4650773	4653735	I want that one, Bobby!
4653775	4654276	Shut up, dude.
4654296	4655217	That's a hella cool name.
4655397	4655937	Fuzzy Hat.
4656197	4656978	Hello, Fuzzy Hat.
4656998	4658019	What brings you to today's tournament?
4661462	4663244	Um, it's either this or go to Dave & Buster's.
4664705	4667027	Oh, you're here for Derby Owners Club, too, then?
4667568	4669750	No, I get Derby Owners Club for free at Dave & Buster's.
4670370	4670791	Oh!
4671191	4671732	Oh, I see.
4672152	4673173	Are you going to be participating?
4675887	4677448	Are you going to be participating in Improv 2?
4677828	4678269	Yeah.
4678789	4680410	Now what happens if you get Baby Baby Love Me?
4681351	4685093	It'll be hella awesome.
4685173	4686474	Will it be erotic and sensuous?
4686854	4688516	No, it'll just be hella awesome.
4688536	4688936	Sounds good.
4693359	4694580	Well, good luck to you both.
4694660	4695020	Good luck.
4695800	4698622	Also over here, let's say hello to an old favorite of the show as well.
4698903	4699503	Say hello to MLB.
4700544	4702365	Hello, buddy.
4704296	4707319	And what brings you to today's tournament?
4707780	4708240	Intrigue.
4708741	4719252	It's just kind of interesting to see after all the ranting and raving there's been going on between preparedness and improv routines, there's a competition catered to the improv kind.
4719612	4721615	So do you think something like this was needed for the community?
4722976	4724558	I think improv is...
4725889	4730674	It's just as important to freestyle as prepared routines are.
4731015	4733377	There are some people who prefer the former over the latter.
4733397	4737842	There are some who think that someone who has raw talent should be able to win every tourney.
4738122	4741546	This is one for argument's sake, if nothing else.
4742587	4743828	So you're not going to be participating, though?
4744649	4755778	Oh, I would, but it's like, I gotta save my goods up for the CBN coming up in a couple weeks, and it's like, if I, you know, blow my wad now, I'll be shooting blanks at CBN, and then, you know, what happens there?
4756379	4758200	Heaven forbid, Mel Blank.
4759701	4761303	Yeah, that's what the B will stand for.
4764325	4765166	That's all, folks!
4766947	4771831	On that note, I think this interview is going to come to a close, but do you guys have any final thoughts, anything you guys want to say to listeners, Orange Ons?
4773149	4777893	Yeah, uh, go out there, have some fun, and where's the beer?
4779234	4779914	Where is the beer?
4779955	4780955	That's a very good question.
4781836	4790023	Jamie, Jamie's, the lovely DarkSakura, who couldn't be here tonight, unfortunately, is going to be getting drunk on the show, I believe, the next week's show.
4790043	4792104	While I'm away at CyberBeat Nation, she's going to help me get drunk.
4792424	4794826	I love you, DarkSakura.
4796027	4797889	You should have been here.
4800171	4801772	Wait, Jamie, I want to interrupt and say something.
4802345	4805908	Um, I will be getting drunk and DarkSakura will be getting drunk with me.
4807029	4807390	Word.
4807790	4810773	And our static problem got worse.
4811113	4812654	Damn it, our static problem.
4812694	4822163	I won't be getting drunk, I don't think, because I don't drink and I'm kind of afraid to drink because since I'd be such a lightweight, you know, getting sick and then possibly violent, you know, who knows.
4822743	4824285	You're going to be around two drunk women.
4825037	4825277	Yes.
4825998	4827659	We're going to be, like, laughing our asses off.
4827679	4831020	Too bad there's no, like, attraction or anything, or you could be in the middle of a lesbian sandwich.
4831201	4831701	No!
4832782	4833742	All right, back to the interviews.
4835943	4837224	It's called work, and it's evil.
4841046	4841987	Any final thoughts from LB?
4843147	4844408	RTF World domination.
4844728	4846509	Give us your finest meats and cheeses.
4847550	4848571	Any final words from Shark Skrull?
4849191	4850412	Say no to derby owner crack.
4851192	4853093	And even though I already asked her anything from Bondage Boy?
4854134	4854234	Um...
4855057	4855477	Not really.
4855877	4856718	I love your hair, by the way.
4857058	4857518	Thank you.
4857758	4858518	It's fake.
4859019	4859499	It's fake.
4859599	4860519	It's smurfalicious.
4861039	4861519	Yeah.
4862460	4863860	All right, more interviews to come later.
4865001	4870623	And now joining us at the table, the ever so lovely tonight's, introduce yourself, kind lady.
4870643	4872764	Hi, I'm Jenny Bean.
4872964	4873784	What's up, everyone?
4873864	4875225	How are you doing tonight?
4875245	4876305	What brings you to Milpitas tonight?
4876843	4878685	The wonderful tournament that Milton's running.
4879325	4879626	Right on.
4879646	4880767	Are you going to be participating?
4880827	4881788	Are you judging or what's going on?
4882048	4882589	I'm judging.
4883389	4884731	Now, okay, I haven't talked to a judge yet.
4884751	4887053	What are you going to be looking for in tonight's improv?
4887957	4890259	I don't know, it's harder to judge improv, I think.
4890519	4892481	But, um, I don't know.
4892641	4895223	I'm just looking for a good flow of routines and all that.
4895843	4897465	The normal stuff.
4897505	4898806	Now, I know you can't play favorites.
4898826	4901768	Was there any particular person you're looking forward to seeing do an improv routine?
4902208	4902589	Not really.
4902669	4906532	Actually, I guess Fuzzy Hat, because I like his improv routines.
4906592	4907573	I think he's pretty good at them.
4907593	4908674	He does some pretty good shit.
4909234	4910755	We're hoping he gets Baby Baby Love Me.
4911175	4912196	That would be cool!
4913593	4916014	Anything else you want to say to the listeners of Orange Launch Radio?
4916074	4920177	And DarkSakura and Loki, they're in the studio, couldn't be here tonight.
4920397	4923278	Hello to all of them and hello to everyone who's listening.
4925099	4927221	Any words of wisdom for Bomani players out there?
4928741	4931583	Any new people that want to start improv freestyling?
4934024	4934945	Watch videos.
4936325	4936986	Sounds good.
4937206	4937606	All right.
4938026	4938867	More interviews to come.
4942020	4948362	Alright, a little bit of time has passed, and PA's over now, and I had a second to step outside with this fine gentleman.
4948402	4949823	Introduce yourself for all the Orange Islands listeners.
4950423	4953284	I'm Milton, aka Maple, the tournament organizer of NorCal.
4953764	4954304	Right on!
4954384	4956245	So, what made you decide to do a tournament today?
4957566	4963348	Well, Xtreme came out a month ago, and I promised Paul, as well as a lot of other people, that I'd throw a tournament one month after we got Xtreme.
4963868	4965408	So, a month later, tournament.
4966028	4966369	How's it going?
4966389	4967249	You guys happy with the turnout?
4968112	4968672	Turnout, yes.
4968993	4971694	We didn't think it would be this many people, but then people surprised us.
4972054	4973715	Last minute people come and, you know.
4974356	4974696	Right on.
4974716	4978318	So what made you guys decide to do an improv freestyle as opposed to the typical routine freestyle?
4978858	4981640	Well, honestly, out of all my tournaments, I've never run improv.
4981700	4983221	It's always been routine freestyle.
4984001	4991566	And a person, Jason Rain, or Rain on the boards as you may know, he brought to my attention that, you know, there should be improv, just improv against routine.
4992228	4997212	So I decided to throw improv freestyle, and then a lot of people entered, you know, people supported, some people didn't support it.
4997672	5000354	And besides, I didn't want to have a routine freestyle with CBN coming up so soon.
5001254	5006078	That's what a lot of people have been saying, is that they're kind of glad that it didn't happen because they're saving their routines for CyberBeat, so I'll be going.
5006118	5007139	So you're going to be going to CyberBeat?
5007519	5007819	Of course.
5008179	5009260	Alright, looking forward to that.
5009760	5015524	So how many tournaments have you, in the past year, how many tournaments have you had a hand in running, do you think?
5016205	5017326	In running or helping with?
5019087	5020448	Both, if you can recall either.
5023422	5026385	Everything from Fremont to now, excluding Spiegel 2.
5027966	5028507	Everything.
5029508	5030048	I'm pretty sure.
5030088	5030889	In NorCal.
5031109	5032310	That's a whole lot of tournaments.
5033371	5035853	Wait, you haven't actually judged a tournament in a while, though.
5035873	5036834	That's kind of a break for you.
5037014	5041098	Well, I judged MGL Evil Tournament 2, which was December 13th.
5041778	5045482	What kind of things do you think the judges will be looking for tonight in Improv Freestyles post-routine freestyle?
5046262	5046583	Well, for...
5047375	5048116	We're from Freestyle.
5048536	5053159	This time I have seven judges, and they're each judging a category.
5053700	5060305	For example, one of them is judging on energy, one of them is judging on power moves, other one is judging on arrow flexibility, which is how to use the arrows.
5061226	5063347	Any other upcoming events you want to let our listeners know about?
5064388	5064668	Not really.
5064688	5068971	The only thing I know about is CBN in February, and then March Madness in March, and then Pride V3 in May.
5069152	5072995	I think May 18th and 19th, I'm pretty sure, or the weekend around there.
5073215	5074536	And then as for summer, I don't know.
5074616	5075837	And I think Spiegel 3.
5076989	5077389	Right, Corey?
5078650	5079110	Supposedly.
5079130	5079650	Supposedly.
5079790	5080631	Big question mark.
5080791	5081511	You're here first.
5081851	5082191	Or second.
5082291	5083392	Or third.
5084532	5087354	Anything else you want to say to listeners?
5087374	5087834	Okay, yes.
5088254	5091796	What about the other 13 categories you mentioned to me earlier?
5092736	5093396	What do you mean by them?
5093536	5094017	You said you had 20!
5094057	5095597	I had 20, yes.
5095717	5097598	But I had to cut down.
5098179	5101260	I don't want more judges than there are entries in the tournament.
5103121	5103721	I understand.
5104501	5104822	Dismissed!
5106164	5108265	Thank you for joining us today.
5108365	5108785	No problem.
5108805	5111567	Good luck with the rest of the tournament.
5111967	5113067	Alright, thanks.
5113087	5115289	Okay, so we got another interview here.
5115329	5116989	Introduce yourself for our listeners.
5133104	5133404	Axel?
5133804	5134165	Yeah.
5134445	5134925	Hi guys.
5135585	5135985	What's up?
5136005	5136405	Where you from?
5136706	5137146	Stockton.
5137746	5139907	What brings you to the Milpitas Tournament this evening?
5140807	5143929	To see my buddy Milton and John, Virtue.
5144209	5144709	Don't lie.
5144969	5146950	The rest of the Killer Pals and Samantha.
5148390	5149511	Are you participating in anything tonight?
5149531	5149911	PA?
5150171	5150331	Improv?
5150351	5151292	Oh yeah, I did PA.
5151572	5152012	How'd you do?
5152792	5153833	Lost first round to Tigger.
5154333	5154573	Dope.
5155533	5156114	Very dope.
5156994	5158155	Okay, I'm off then too.
5158355	5159015	What was the song?
5160290	5161571	What was it?
5161631	5162631	It was a gentle stress.
5163292	5163572	Bummer.
5164472	5167954	So you're not going to be doing freestyle?
5167974	5168474	You're watching?
5169015	5169475	I'm leaving.
5170035	5170635	You're leaving?
5172036	5172857	Is it hard to get to?
5172877	5174797	You said you were having problems getting a ride over here?
5175618	5175958	Yes.
5176298	5178259	No one is willing to really take me.
5178639	5181901	Tell us about the DDR scene in Stockton because we don't talk to many people from there.
5182221	5187784	We've talked about Stockton Golf Land on the show because we refer to it as Ghetto Golf Land, but...
5188647	5189508	It is pretty ghetto.
5190929	5192731	If you want to get shot, then that's the place to go.
5192951	5194592	Have you ever seen anyone get killed at Golf Line?
5194793	5196194	No, but I've witnessed a shooting.
5196514	5198055	Have you ever wanted to kill somebody at Golf Line?
5198416	5198776	Not me.
5199296	5200958	Those little kids are fucking mean.
5201038	5201939	Yeah, I know.
5201999	5202800	Every day I want to kill them.
5203060	5203780	They ask for tokens.
5204841	5205702	I give them to them.
5206162	5206923	They're intimidating.
5207424	5208725	Anything else you want to say to our listeners this evening?
5209285	5209706	Bye, guys.
5211927	5212408	Says it all.
5213968	5219971	All right, we are back with somebody who was on the show a couple weeks ago when we were at his tournament, but now he's here at the Milpitas tournament.
5220232	5221172	Introduce yourselves to the listeners.
5221832	5222253	Hi, guys.
5222293	5223013	I'm DCB.
5223833	5224654	Hi, DCB.
5224674	5225735	What brings you to Milpitas today?
5226555	5227375	One word.
5228016	5228936	Shades.
5229557	5231418	That's another interview I've got to get later if I can.
5233119	5233299	So...
5234684	5235865	What kinds of stuff are you doing here today?
5235885	5237366	Are you participating in PA?
5238166	5240467	I was one of the three people that didn't qualify for PA.
5240988	5241268	Dope!
5241468	5243509	Yeah, I'm that leet.
5243629	5244610	You're in a special club?
5244910	5246751	Yeah, there's like three of us, so that's cool.
5247471	5248432	Did you come in dead last?
5249052	5250193	Nah, I don't know.
5250253	5250693	Ask Milton.
5251654	5252474	Well, that's something.
5252494	5253695	At least you didn't come in last.
5254035	5256116	Or if you did, hey, last place or something.
5257057	5258437	So I hear you got a joke for the listeners.
5259118	5259698	Knock, knock.
5260138	5260979	Who's there?
5261039	5261499	Bob.
5261739	5262320	Bob who?
5262340	5263000	Bob Saget.
5263020	5263060	Oh!
5266217	5266457	Ha.
5267598	5268339	Dot, dot, dot.
5268379	5268819	Ha, ha.
5269820	5272882	I think if you were on Star Search, they would have given you one star, but that's all right.
5273363	5276005	I'd rather be on American Idol, because Simon is sexy.
5276566	5278187	You want to audition for American Idol right now?
5278207	5279368	You want to sing us something?
5279388	5279428	No.
5279448	5280089	Sing us something from DDR.
5280109	5281570	Come on, Cartoon Heroes.
5282451	5284292	We are the Killer Pals.
5284332	5285013	Hi, guys.
5286334	5287435	Explain to our listeners.
5287455	5288596	I don't think we talked about this in Fremont.
5288616	5289737	Tell us about the Killer Pals.
5289757	5290978	What is the concept behind Killer Pals?
5291818	5292499	and plug the website.
5292759	5293860	We really don't know.
5293961	5297365	It's just like all my friends and we call ourselves the Killer Pals.
5297505	5298145	Do you kill people?
5298506	5299427	No, we don't kill people.
5299467	5306535	We're actually nice kids and we get good grades in school and we drink our milk every night.
5307536	5310640	I was going to say, I noticed you changed from Kirk Cameron to Bob Saget.
5310860	5311521	What brought this on?
5312716	5314097	Kirk Cameron is just old.
5314617	5315978	He didn't want to be my friend anymore.
5316398	5317819	But Bob Saget, he's fresh.
5317879	5318759	Yeah, he's cool.
5319039	5319579	New ideas.
5319819	5320420	New ideas.
5321340	5323041	Dirty Works is one of my favorite movies of all time.
5323541	5324341	I like Full House.
5325662	5327923	Hey, did you hear the Olsen twins are going to college soon?
5327943	5329644	I did it.
5330524	5331425	That one's for you, bro, too.
5331665	5332785	Who's your favorite Olsen twin?
5333906	5334286	Yeah, anyway.
5334666	5338648	Anything else you want to say for our listeners?
5340303	5343765	I just did the shittiest routine ever in a DDR tournament.
5343805	5345426	Can you say shittiest?
5345486	5347347	Yes, you can say anything you want on the fucking internet.
5348307	5349508	Yeah, it sucked real bad.
5349528	5350309	I didn't know what I was doing.
5350349	5353711	I tried popping and locking all those cool kids, but I'm too white to do it.
5354471	5359994	And then all the other killer pals got behind the machine and started making designs with their arms.
5360535	5362596	And I don't know, I was just trying not to fail the stupid song.
5362616	5363717	Were you leading everybody in the wave?
5364457	5365378	I don't know what I was doing.
5365538	5366178	What song did you get?
5366638	5367439	Secret Rendezvous.
5368882	5369462	Secret Lovers.
5370562	5371943	Oh, is that the concept behind Killer Pals?
5371963	5372443	No, I'm just kidding.
5373063	5374263	That's between me and Bob Saget.
5376043	5379664	Well, you know what they say about Bob Saget.
5379804	5380124	All right.
5380304	5381685	Any final words for listeners?
5382065	5382665	Bye, guys.
5383345	5383865	How did I know?
5384645	5384925	All right.
5385005	5387666	I'm just going to move right over here to somebody who has been piping in.
5387966	5389146	Because he always has something to say.
5389226	5389666	Say hello.
5389826	5392307	This is, what, the fourth or fifth time you've been on the show?
5393067	5394167	Let's see.
5394287	5395087	Conquered.
5396828	5397488	Just tell us who you are.
5398286	5412995	I'm God, I mean Virtu, Tori, Max300, yeah, oh my god, it's the Max300 guy, yeah, um, no, no, Max Unlimited, and Legend of Max, and DDR, or Dance Dance Revolution, and you're, DDR, and you're telling me about AAAs today?
5413275	5422900	Yes, I have 20 heavy AAAs in two weeks, you're almost a Yasu level there, no, no, I'm scared of Yasu, what would you do if you showed up at Cyber Beat Nation?
5423461	5424141	I wouldn't enter, what?
5427438	5428079	Bye, guys!
5428399	5428979	Bye, guys!
5429179	5430559	Oh, wait, say hello to our listeners.
5430579	5431240	Who are you, young lady?
5431480	5432480	Hi, I'm Samantha.
5432640	5433280	Hi, Samantha.
5433340	5434080	Anything you want to say?
5434180	5435121	I have a Fakuk shirt, too.
5435141	5436161	It's one of my favorite clothing brands.
5436181	5436921	Everybody loves Fakuk.
5437301	5438362	Everybody loves to Fakuk.
5438862	5441943	I have an Evo.
5441963	5442463	Well, bye!
5444023	5446384	Hey, back to Virtue.
5446564	5449965	Before I was so rudely interrupted... Calm down, buddy.
5450505	5453426	Well, we were like, oh my god, a chick that plays DDR, so, you know, we had to...
5454252	5454792	We had to break.
5455473	5456114	News bulletin.
5456934	5460077	Of course, we've got DarkSakura in the studio right now.
5460117	5461258	I know Chick plays DDR, but, you know.
5463019	5464460	So, yes, do you have questions for me?
5464760	5465701	Do I have questions for you?
5465741	5466782	Yeah, what the hell are you doing here today?
5466822	5467943	You doing Perfect Attack?
5467963	5468583	You doing Freestyle?
5468744	5469544	I'm losing to Tigger.
5470485	5471726	As Perfect Attack's over, you lost to Tigger?
5471806	5472186	Final round?
5472407	5472707	Yeah.
5473267	5473668	What was it?
5473708	5474368	What'd you have to fight him on?
5474608	5475289	Perfect Attack.
5475789	5476450	Fucking holic.
5477190	5477811	Piece of shit.
5477891	5479052	Motherfucking cocksuck.
5479732	5480613	How bad did he beat you?
5480633	5481634	93 Marvelous?
5481674	5481774	Nope.
5486454	5488375	So you're not going to be doing a freestyle today?
5488875	5490456	I did my freestyle with the Killer Pals.
5490796	5491657	I made the design.
5492117	5492477	Oh, okay.
5492497	5493218	What was the design?
5493318	5494558	What design were you a part of?
5494918	5495539	I was the arm.
5498420	5498861	Okay.
5499401	5503083	So any other... You know that Buddha thing that has all the weird arms and like 50 legs?
5503583	5504704	We made that behind the machine.
5504984	5506125	And the machine was the body.
5508639	5509559	Very interesting.
5509699	5517522	I just had a picture of like all the fobs in the crowd, just like on their hands and knees worshipping Buddha, but they didn't realize it was a DDR machine.
5518643	5521004	So it's now BBR, Buddha Buddha Revolution.
5522664	5523385	Did you rub its belly?
5524485	5525185	I fucked its belly.
5525706	5526586	Side note, he's going to hell.
5527626	5528127	Are you going to hell?
5528547	5529847	I'm not Philippine, I mean Viet like you.
5529867	5532168	We're all going to hell for laughing.
5532548	5533168	Bye guys!
5533189	5534109	Bye guys!
5535089	5535950	Anything you want to plug?
5536830	5536990	Um...
5538229	5562743	www.bmoneystyle.com, as always, the7.net for my web space, which is almost gone, Killer Pals, I don't know the website because it's too damn long, maple.org, because he has the best blog in the world because he doesn't do anything on it, coryinamerica.com, soon to come, because I triple A'd tears,
5564895	5567476	and B-11 on my second try, which is also my first 9-footer.
5567696	5568876	Did you send those pictures to Aaron?
5569376	5572597	Aaron wouldn't take my B-11 because it wasn't the result screen, fucking cock.
5574038	5577139	The views and opinions dispersed on Orange Line.
5577259	5581320	I... You can address those cards and letters to Virtu, care of the Max 300 King's Palace.
5582200	5586241	Yeah, my address is... Sunnyvale Golf Land.
5586922	5589602	1984, East El Camino Real, Golf Land 94068.
5590963	5593384	How much time would you say you spend at Sunnyvale Golf Land a week?
5594264	5594504	Since...
5595203	5595963	Extreme came out.
5595983	5608028	I've been there every day practicing for Cyber Beat Nation because I want the fucking controller and I need $400 so I can go to fucking Magic 5 up in Seattle and then go to Midwest Showdown 5 over in Michigan.
5608228	5609369	You're a silly DDR kid.
5609689	5610849	Hey, you can suck my cock.
5611930	5612270	He is.
5613831	5615031	Hey, I got a bigger cock than you.
5616692	5620773	And on that note, any final... I'm not going to respond to that because we all know that I have the bigger one.
5622334	5622994	Okay, Milton?
5623815	5623955	I'll...
5626419	5629580	to be settled on a future episode any final thoughts for the listeners?
5629780	5647730	write down the chat where everyone's going dot dot dot dot dot dot dot dot dot dot dot dot dot oh my god, the imagery, the imagery alright, right now I'm picturing fucking Twin saying like, what the fuck and then there's fucking I'm gonna beep that name out because we don't talk about that you're gonna beep Twin out?
5647970	5649611	yeah, we're gonna beep that name out what?
5651812	5653133	you can't talk about retards on your show?
5653971	5655452	Well, okay, I guess we can make a decision.
5655593	5656453	Just because you're Vertu.
5657134	5657795	Yes, Jamie?
5658515	5660877	By the way, I encourage leaving that intact.
5661218	5664781	Yes, so thanks to Jamie, we didn't beep it.
5665161	5666703	Jamie convinced me that we shouldn't beep it.
5666723	5667744	You're welcome, Corey.
5667924	5668284	Here we go.
5669205	5669745	Moving right along.
5669765	5673108	I'm going to be honest with you, your channel is almost as bad as DDR Maniac.
5675671	5676091	Why is that?
5676451	5678253	Because it's filled with twin.
5678954	5680235	Not anymore, we banned his ass like a month ago.
5681423	5683965	That's how long I've been gone because Twin's been.
5685866	5686867	Jesus Christ.
5687788	5689149	Hello, welcome to 5 Minutes Ago.
5689829	5690630	Alright, any final thoughts?
5691890	5692931	See you guys at CeraVeat Nation.
5692951	5694833	I'm expecting another interview at CeraVeat Nation.
5695793	5696274	We'll see.
5696614	5696974	We'll see.
5697594	5699656	How much if I bribe you will I get an interview?
5700617	5702318	Maybe if I get to play that controller that you win.
5703178	5704659	We're just listening to Virtue.
5704679	5705860	We want to hear some Kyle Snyder.
5705880	5706641	No, it's all about me.
5706661	5708102	I mean Snyder.
5709272	5711374	Why don't we interview this fellow over here?
5711995	5715879	Actually, before we interview that fellow over there, Jamie wanted to read something for all you folks.
5717061	5721626	This is an email sent by Twin bragging about all the channels he's been banned from.
5722717	5729146	Actually, this was an email sent by Twen because I told him to fuck off for trying to start shit last week.
5729626	5735354	And the dumbass, he emailed me back and was like, Oh, please, please, please, can you send me the arcade disc for DDR Extreme?
5735594	5737316	Like, I'm going to say, Oh, okay.
5737576	5738438	I'll just totally forget that.
5738658	5739319	But instead, he's like,
5739899	5743680	Hey Loki, this is the only other way I know how to get in contact with you.
5743700	5745780	He sent me an email through my website because there's a form.
5746520	5752441	Since I'm banned from DDR Mania X, It Music, Bomani Style, DDR UK, and Orange Lounge.
5753261	5754422	Congratulations!
5755722	5757082	Congratulations, you suck.
5759002	5760743	Alright, moving right along with the interviews.
5760983	5761823	Let's interview this fellow.
5762943	5764943	I'll be right back.
5764963	5765363	BRB.
5765744	5766004	Okay.
5767404	5768284	Okay, in the meantime...
5769252	5769892	How are you, gentlemen?
5772173	5773333	Okay.
5774334	5775454	Introduce yourself for our listeners.
5775474	5776554	You don't even know what the hell you're getting into.
5776574	5779655	This part sucks because this guy didn't want to be interviewed, so just bear with us.
5781496	5782777	You don't have anything you want to say?
5784197	5784397	No.
5785157	5785457	All right.
5786058	5786398	I cry.
5786838	5789059	All right, we'll be... That's what I wanted to say.
5789079	5789599	Hi, guys.
5789699	5792980	All right, we'll come back whenever Virtue gets back here with his surprise.
5794983	5795604	Wait, you have an idea?
5795824	5796364	We're still rolling.
5796424	5798426	Oh, okay.
5798746	5799047	You know what?
5799107	5800328	I'm just going to let Virtue do this interview.
5802189	5803450	Why, thank you.
5803550	5804051	You're welcome.
5804371	5805312	Would you like to hold my stuff?
5805332	5806113	Yes, I will hold your stuff.
5806273	5807874	It gleams with sex.
5807894	5809295	You have Melody's camera.
5809676	5810476	I have my camera.
5810837	5811577	I had it before me.
5812098	5813359	I had it before her.
5813839	5814900	Hi, so what's your name?
5815401	5815621	Alex.
5816602	5818944	Alex, what's your... Mr. Cool.
5820065	5820745	Mr. Cool.
5821025	5821626	Mr. Cool.
5822086	5822747	And what's it supposed to mean?
5824299	5824859	Actually, I got it.
5825079	5825660	It's a nickname.
5826741	5829323	During class one day, we were talking about rappers.
5830003	5831305	I said something about mystical.
5831485	5836369	One of my friends misunderstood me for Mr. Cool, so that's pretty much how I got the name.
5838551	5841253	That's funny that happened in school, because, like, be cool, stay in school.
5841994	5843515	Yeah, yeah.
5843835	5844576	Did you stay in school?
5845917	5848639	I didn't stay in college, but, you know, I'm not a role model, so it's okay.
5848659	5849180	You're not cool.
5850365	5851886	I know.
5852286	5853166	I drink and smoke crack.
5853206	5854527	But anyway, I'm sorry, I'm not being interviewed.
5855107	5856267	He oozes sex as well.
5857928	5860089	So, what are you doing today at the tournament?
5860109	5861410	Are you running PA, freestyle?
5861430	5861810	Freestyle.
5862070	5862850	Improv freestyle, yeah.
5862910	5863350	Freestyle.
5863770	5864831	What's the motive you're going with?
5865311	5865591	Mode?
5866111	5866352	Motive.
5867272	5867752	Any theme?
5868392	5869753	No, I'm just... No.
5870973	5872934	I'm just hoping I have a fast sign, just like do whatever.
5873234	5876396	Do you plan to do hand drops and hand plants and knee drops?
5877076	5877256	No.
5878917	5879297	What was that?
5879677	5879797	No.
5880714	5881815	Are you praying for Dynamite Rave?
5882955	5883516	Definitely.
5883616	5885957	As long as I get that song, if not, I'll argue.
5886678	5887939	Can we see a bar hop in your routine?
5889119	5889260	No.
5890400	5891301	No, we can't see any bar hops?
5891881	5893582	I think I'll get disqualified.
5894963	5895684	The bar is your friend.
5896024	5896564	I know.
5897185	5897985	I like the bar.
5901167	5901828	Jump over the bar.
5901848	5904189	Do you have any final words for the listeners?
5905430	5905610	No.
5906531	5907491	Okay, that's you.
5907531	5908072	I'm better than you.
5908112	5908452	Peace out.
5911158	5914279	Hey, alright, the tournament's over now, but I got one more interview tonight.
5914599	5915859	Because I missed him at Fremont.
5916139	5919600	I promised to interview this guy at Fremont, and I completely forgot because I'm an asshole.
5919880	5921161	But, here he is.
5921421	5922661	Introduce yourself for our listening audience.
5923301	5927662	I'm Ben, aka Chubbs, and that's all I got to say about that.
5928102	5928762	How you doing?
5929183	5930723	I'm not bad, I guess.
5931243	5933124	What brought you to the Milpitas tournament tonight?
5933644	5938565	Well, I was judging, so if I didn't come, I think Milton would be angry with me.
5940077	5941178	Sounds pretty reasonable.
5941298	5943940	So what kinds of things were you looking for tonight in the improv routines?
5944340	5948243	Well, my specific category as a judge was looking for their charisma.
5948904	5950645	So that was the only thing I was judging on.
5951883	5958909	What were some of the good qualities that you saw tonight, the better charismatic things that you saw tonight?
5959249	5966115	Well, Lil B was facing the crowd pretty much the whole time, and that was pretty good for Charisma, and he looked like he was having a pretty good time too.
5966495	5970098	JC also, like those two in my book were pretty close.
5971079	5972260	Those are probably the only good ones.
5972280	5975123	What do you think about judging improv versus judging routines?
5975923	5982610	Judging routines is probably easier because there's not just one specific thing you judge.
5983051	5984692	It's just judging the whole routine.
5986074	5989037	At least when you see a bad one, it's not so painful when it's improv, right?
5989717	5991579	Yeah, because they have an excuse.
5993234	5993614	Right on.
5993654	5996455	So what other kinds of events are you going to be attending in the near future?
5996535	5997875	Anything you want to plug, or I don't know?
5998095	5998995	I don't know.
5999395	6002136	I'm just going to go to pretty much every tournament in the future.
6002276	6006037	Back to basic, CBN, and I don't know what's after that.
6006437	6007177	How'd you do in Perfect Attack?
6007197	6008138	Did you do Perfect Attack today?
6008318	6010038	Yeah, I got third.
6010058	6011518	Not too shabby.
6011858	6012319	Kind of.
6013219	6019740	See, Milton fucked up, and he forgot to have the third place match between me and Chaos.
6019760	6020040	Nope.
6020760	6022401	So, yeah, we're splitting third.
6023453	6023854	That's all good.
6023874	6024194	It works.
6024815	6028020	So, any other final thoughts you have for the folks out there listening?
6030744	6030964	No.
6032546	6033287	Alright, that works.
6033928	6036251	I think we're all tired as hell and it's time to go home.
6036351	6037894	So, that's it.
6038453	6040414	Milpitas Golf Land, we're out, bye
6071286	6073828	Don't forget, Lovefist are in town right now.
6073848	6074148	What's that?
6074168	6075129	Lovefist is in town.
6075369	6075810	Whatever.
6076150	6079633	I flunk school because I'm hardcore.
6080193	6080554	What?
6080694	6082495	I've never even said that shit in my life.
6082575	6085157	What is... Is it from Vice City?
6085678	6087559	And that guy supposedly sounds like me or something?
6088540	6091502	Somebody was telling me the other day that I sound like some guy in Vice City.
6092823	6093664	Rob's famous.
6093784	6094425	That's scary.
6094525	6095145	I'm famous.
6095225	6095586	Infamous.
6095746	6096967	That is me, dammit!
6097952	6098493	Yeah, right.
6098533	6098754	Anyway.
6099035	6099396	Okay, yes.
6099416	6099997	We're going to take a break.
6100017	6101341	When we come back, we're going to do a list list.
6101361	6103286	And that means you all get to participate.
6103687	6104449	And you're going to vote.
6105097	6106437	So here's a hint, you guys.
6107418	6110799	During the break, you're going to get a big hint as to what our listless topic is tonight.
6111259	6111699	Enjoy.
6112239	6116361	I'm supposed to say hi to Strong Brad and apologizing for not interviewing him at Miggle.
6116681	6117421	We'll get him next time.
6117961	6122182	The next interviews, by the way, will be at Cyber Beat Nation in a couple weeks.
6122322	6128044	There might even be a whole separate special out of that, like a different aired tape thing.
6128084	6128824	I'm not sure yet.
6128904	6130185	We have to talk about that, all the hosts.
6130885	6133586	Anyway, I do not sound like Cookie from You Don't Know Jack.
6133626	6133946	Fuck off.
6135908	6136208	Shut up!
6136329	6137109	All of you, shut up!
6138050	6138751	Alright, we'll be back.
6138771	6141614	Oh, do it all night.
6141855	6143096	Do it with me.
6143556	6146820	I'll take you to heaven if you make me feel free, babe.
6146860	6148281	Do it tonight.
6148542	6149963	Do it alright.
6150184	6153087	Just take me and shake me till I burn up inside.
6175889	6176711	Thank you for watching!
6225100	6229005	Thank you for watching!
6282367	6283614	Thank you for watching!
6329281	6334802	Easier to dance to than that freaking catch-up song, Orange Lounge Radio.
6336162	6338563	Hello kids, welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio.
6339063	6342183	I missed an FU that came in over email.
6342203	6346964	What happened is I'd actually read it before the show and then forgot to get back to it when the show was going on.
6347044	6348545	So fuck me for missing it.
6348625	6350165	I'm sorry, sorry.
6350245	6354086	And it's from DDR Angel, who's a huge supporter of this show, and I feel bad because I missed it.
6354326	6355266	So let's get to her FU.
6355286	6355326	FU!
6357335	6364658	HerFU is, fuck you to my graveyard shift co-worker who didn't bother to call me once last night to tell me he was going to be late to begin with.
6364778	6369080	Fuck you to parents for not understanding your children even though you think you do, you're not us, haha.
6369380	6372641	And finally a nice fuck you to earthquakes that have been pestering us all day long.
6373782	6376823	Alright, so, my bad, I missed that earlier in the show.
6377623	6379584	Please accept my apology!
6380604	6381685	Alright, um...
6383596	6386898	And does anybody know the final results from MGL?
6386958	6387599	Good question.
6388219	6396664	First place in Perfect Attack was Tigger, second was Virtue, and third was Chubs and Chaos, I believe, tied.
6396684	6397605	I hope I didn't fuck that up.
6400120	6405022	Freestyle, Improv Freestyle, first was JC, I believe his name was.
6405903	6409164	Second place was, oh, I can look it up on DDR Freak, that's a good idea.
6410805	6416768	I know second place was Lil B, third place, third place was somebody else, I don't remember who third place was, let me look.
6417949	6422751	I know Oki, Oki was in fourth, oh, I think, yes, yes, because Fuzzy Cat won money, he was excited he won money.
6422791	6424552	Fuzzy Cat was third, you're right, thank you.
6426013	6426313	Alright.
6429062	6441371	Alright, thank you, you guys, uh, hey, and even, one of the judges is in the chat room, I'm so retarded, I didn't even think to ask, but she's, Jenny Bean does confirm that yes, hello by the way, Jenny, uh, JC, Lil B, and Fuzzy, one, two, and three, right there.
6442272	6442552	Alright.
6442572	6444654	Alright, now we get to our favorite part of the show.
6445274	6446415	Uh, Angel also says fuck you to her head cold.
6446435	6450518	Well, my second favorite part of the show, actually my favorite part of the show is the fuck you to the weak, but, our other favorite part of the show.
6450879	6451319	Yay!
6451519	6455282	Yay, it's the listless, and tonight, the topic, it's the listless.
6455883	6457064	You should do a theme song.
6457304	6457784	No.
6457824	6458825	Sing us a theme song.
6459666	6461448	It's a listless shame.
6461648	6462509	You're on a roll there.
6463530	6470657	We'll get... We'll get... Everybody... That's what the fucking song is.
6471618	6471978	You know what?
6472639	6472959	You know what?
6472979	6473460	We're gonna get...
6477927	6479067	No, this is not dancer.
6479147	6481389	I'm blowing out people's speakers.
6481509	6481829	Okay.
6483170	6483710	Oh, where were we?
6483730	6484410	Yes, list list.
6484430	6485131	Tonight's list list.
6486451	6490113	Title or song that erotic needs to do.
6490333	6492635	A possible title for a new erotic song.
6492815	6496617	This is actually coming from my fuck off show from Tuesday, was it?
6497037	6499659	Where we were like coming up with erotic song titles in the chat room.
6500519	6503941	Which I'm actually doing one of them on my list.
6504935	6508616	Alright, so these are all songs that Erotic hasn't done, but they should.
6509096	6513078	So, starting off, we've got, who's all participating in the room?
6513118	6514578	Raise your hands so I make sure I don't miss everyone.
6515218	6521040	One, two, three, four, five, six, okay, we've got six people participating, so we've got quite a few.
6521080	6522401	Ryan is reading for Ryan.
6523361	6524981	I'm reading for someone else, so these aren't mine.
6525582	6528263	Alright, and then we have the other Ryan, we have Puppy Ryan.
6528563	6530203	You're not, you aren't Ryan, you're Puppy.
6530563	6531944	Alright, who's starting?
6532304	6532524	Me!
6533519	6537941	All right, Jamie, your number three pick for an erotic song.
6539982	6541683	Watching my ex have hot man sex.
6541943	6544084	Watching my ex have hot man sex.
6548086	6549747	It's definitely erotic style.
6549807	6550187	All right.
6550707	6552388	Watching my ex have hot man sex.
6552428	6553428	Can you sing a bar from that?
6553748	6556090	I'm watching my ex have hot man sex.
6556230	6556370	Okay.
6558061	6560082	Alright, now Ryan is reading for Ryan.
6560123	6561443	These aren't his picks, but they're the other Ryan's.
6561463	6563265	We were singing that to the tune of Love on the Phone.
6563305	6563845	You're right, I was.
6563865	6567267	Alright, I have no idea which order this is in.
6567368	6568989	Alright, we'll just pick one that's number three.
6569429	6571651	Okay, Loose Like a Rubber Band.
6572171	6573572	Loose Like a Rubber Band.
6574012	6575974	Can you sing us a bar from Loose Like a Rubber Band?
6576274	6576854	It's not mine.

7059718	7062359	I'm going to remove Loose Like a Rubber Band.
7062599	7064459	Loose Like a Rubber Band comes off the list.
7064479	7065960	It's just not very exciting sounding.
7065980	7066300	All right.
7067945	7070226	Wait, wait, we gotta get Ryan.
7070266	7072886	Even since the other Ryan's not in here, Ryan gets to pick one off the list.

7107579	7109320	I didn't want that image, okay?
7109740	7113062	Anyway... Uh, let's see.

7142738	7145239	I'm going to take off... The strap-on.
7146439	7147039	This is kind of hard.
7147079	7149840	I'm going to take off Crouching Cocker Hidden Pussy.
7150220	7152181	That's a porno title, not an erotic song title.
7152701	7153141	Yeah.
7153201	7153481	All right.

7621776	7632161	Alright, we have the results for what has been one of our most popular, I think, I think it's one of our most popular listless segments we've ever done here on this show.
7632261	7633242	It was fun, that's for sure.
7633442	7635663	You remember that adult content disclaimer at the beginning of the show?
7635703	7636464	I hope y'all were listening.
7636564	7637584	Yeah, pay attention.
7637684	7644728	And when I posted about this on the DDR Community Live Journal, I put, you know, warning, there's some adult content on this program if y'all are like 12 years old.
7646949	7648630	Everybody wants to hear, some!
7649290	7651214	Don't you ever talk about DDR on that show?
7651274	7652175	All you ever talk about is porn.
7652215	7652736	Oh yes, the list.
7652756	7653017	Here we go.
7654547	7660631	I'm going to give Jamie the distinct pleasure of getting to read these because we all love when a woman is saying these dirty things to us.

7694681	7695481	Ah, that's true.
7695501	7697722	With of course me being number one because I'm the best.
7698402	7700283	And you all love me and worship me like the goddess I am.
7700403	7703523	Yay, okay, so Sam Lick My Clam is where I still like Temple of Bud.
7703544	7704684	See, Brad's bowing down to me.
7704704	7708605	I still like watching my ex have hot man sex.
7709368	7709889	That was a good one.
7709909	7710730	That was very close.
7710750	7711452	It was very close.
7711492	7712414	That was almost in there.
7713696	7715680	Brad, can you sing us Temple of But one more time?
7718265	7718445	What?
7719780	7720700	The Temple of Butt.
7720880	7721221	Okay.
7721741	7723022	The Temple of Butt.
7723362	7725624	Coming to the Temple of Butt.
7727165	7727746	Alright, anyway.
7727766	7729847	I was thinking it's the Winnie the Pootie.
7729967	7731088	We still have a cage match.
7731689	7732910	We still have a cage match to do.
7732930	7733951	Temple of Butt.
7734171	7735071	Okay, we want to do this?
7735492	7735752	Alright.
7736152	7737053	Loki, talk about this.
7737073	7739034	Pootie, pootie, pootie, pootie, pootie, pootie.
7739455	7740536	Temple of Butt.
7740836	7742877	Pootie, pootie, pootie, pootie, pootie.
7744335	7745276	Guys are weird.
7745736	7751401	Suddenly I'm in preschool again, and we're all, everybody's sitting here going, poopy, pooky, caw, caw, caw, ha, ha, ha.
7751661	7752882	I popped back out again.
7764320	7770923	I still think this DNL thing is like the weirdest thing I've ever seen, that upside down seven.
7772083	7775224	I'm so fucking hyper right now because of the goddamn balls.
7775264	7776585	Jamie's high on balls.
7777285	7779466	No, I've been cutting back on all my caffeine and sugar.
7780266	7781087	and Ellen Piper.
7781107	7783308	Okay, this is a remix I did.
7783588	7784989	I worked on it most of today.
7785690	7792234	The end is fucked up because it's not finished yet and I had to hurry to get it done so you'll notice that the rest of the song sounds cool in the end.
7792254	7793455	You're like, huh?
7793535	7797818	So this is a sort of trance remix of Legend of Max
7797918	7798699	Now, why did you do this?
7798759	7799419	Just for the hell of it?
7799459	7801741	Or did you do it for that little contest that's going on on MyStyle?
7801761	7802381	Or what's this about?
7802421	7803002	I didn't know.
7803502	7808665	I did it because I found the song that they got the vocals out of for Legend of Max, and that's the whole reason why.
7808685	7809646	And I was like, woo!
7809706	7810267	Vocals!
7811107	7812928	So, are you going to enter this?
7812968	7814850	You should enter this in the 2DX remixing contest.
7814870	7817972	I know Legend of Max isn't a 2DX song yet, but, you know.
7818012	7819693	You could call it a Max 300 mix, probably.
7819713	7821895	For one, they canceled that contest.
7821935	7822155	What? !
7822575	7825577	Hey, can you make me a trance mix of something?
7843556	7844837	Make me a trance mix too!
7845297	7846718	Come on, I want a trance mix!
7848319	7849120	We'll see.
7849180	7852062	I want someone to make me a trance mix of the Safari.
7852102	7854323	We want to hear what you guys think about this in the chat room.
7854463	7855904	So post your thoughts.
7856685	7859947	You all can be a judge on American Idol right now and judge Loki.
7859987	7860887	Won't this be fabulous?
7861267	7863289	Okay, this is Legend of Trance here on Orange Lounge Radio.
7974880	7975580	That was cool.
7975620	7978022	Alright, let's pretend it was a cage match song.
7978062	7978683	Let's go around the room.
7978723	7981044	Everybody give your thoughts and give it on a scale of 1 to 10.
7982185	7981044	40.
7983827	7984928	I'm wet right now.
7985348	7987510	Yeah, I'm going to give you 100.
7987550	7988210	Change your pants.
7990392	7992614	Already off the scale, but I'll give it a 9.
7994548	8007210	Since it's my song, the end still needs work, especially that one, the second slowdown there where it says the death, and then the fly, I need to really work on that from there on, that needs work, but yeah, I like it, it's pretty cool.
8008570	8019132	Well, let's just say it's off the scale, this one kicks hella ass, I can't really give it a number, because it's over 10 or over... Just to say, do be continued on the numbers scale.
8019152	8023073	Okay, AAA then.
8024122	8032970	You know, to be honest, it didn't sound a lot remixed, but like enough, so that like, you know, the paranoias aren't really remixed that much either.
8033310	8037013	So, I think that fits into DDR very well.
8037113	8039295	Compared to most of the damn mechs I've heard online.
8041047	8044590	Actually, to be honest, I thought it was like hardly any Macs in there.
8044710	8047212	I don't know, I just kind of heard the melody.
8047252	8049594	Most of the stuff's off of TransAddict.com.
8050215	8053377	I believe the song I used was called I'm Alone or something like that.
8053397	8054398	That was for most of it.
8054698	8060984	Then there's another song called, by the Deep Project, that's called The Fly, which is where they got most of the... Really?
8061684	8062905	I've got the MP3 on there.
8062925	8068110	It's like nine minutes long, but that's where they got the samples for that, unless that's a royalty-free sample that...
8068830	8074614	Hey, I'll buy you dinner if you make me, like, an Ambia Trance remix of the Safari We'll see Safari kicks ass Anyway We'll see, okay, shit Dinner
8101258	8106380	Alright, speaking of the cage match, I think we ought to get to this week's version of it, shouldn't we?
8108181	8111822	Alright, so, let's get into that.
8114043	8120445	Yes, so, I'm finding the cage match theme music here.
8120625	8123026	Somebody requested it earlier in the show, we specifically not play.
8123046	8124406	What are you taking that out for?
8124426	8125587	We need that, don't we?
8127168	8128809	Oh, mine's on there, but yours is on here.
8129329	8130590	Okay.
8130630	8131551	We'll do yours first, Loki.
8131971	8132351	That's fine.
8132431	8133251	Okay, put yours in.
8134332	8135173	Okay, never mind.
8135553	8136113	We know what we're doing.
8136173	8137554	Anyway, yes, last week.
8139015	8140395	Last week on the Orange Lounge Cage Match.
8140476	8142437	Repriced from last week, KK Cockmaster.
8142817	8143757	Oh, wait, wrong week.
8144618	8151762	We had, the winner was, Jamie brought in a Vincent D'Amour song, and it pretty much swept the floor.
8153654	8155755	and it won, so we'll play a little clip of that.
8155795	8163878	The way the cage match works, by the way, since I know we have a lot of new listeners tonight, each host brings in one song and we pick them all against each other.
8164358	8168400	And so we have the winning song from last week and then two new ones that go head-to-head.
8168740	8175582	The winning song goes into rotation on the Orange Lounge Radio's Bomani Music & More program, always on this station when we're not here, live.
8175762	8175962	Yes.
8178191	8178831	Head to Head.
8178951	8179792	Yes, that's what I said.
8180192	8180872	I said Head to Head.
8181192	8182993	Anyway, last week, this was the winner.
8183033	8185834	So this is the first song you can vote for in this week's Cage Max.
8186474	8189455	We're just going to play a clip because the winner only gets a clip played of it.
8189875	8194077	This is Vincent Damore with Eternity from last week here on Orange Lounge Radio.
8194357	8194757	And now...
8256849	8258090	Alright, that was last week's winner.
8258130	8262252	That was Vincent Damore with Eternity, last week's winner.
8262312	8264173	I just had a happy moment with that song.
8264273	8266755	Already the chatroom is kind of slamming on Eternity.
8266815	8268476	They don't know if they care for it anymore.
8268536	8269696	I think they're done with it.
8270177	8271858	So let's bring on the challengers.
8271918	8273779	I don't know, Jamie looks concerned.
8274959	8276240	She's giving the chatroom the finger.
8277141	8278241	Alright, well let's see.
8278321	8282244	I would have to say that this song falls on a completely opposite scale of that song.
8283164	8290591	This is going to be, once again, the Secretions, a local Sacramento punk band, with their song, I'm Gonna Get You So Laid.
8291012	8292854	Alright, so this is the next entry you can vote for.
8292874	8297058	This is a very short, DDR-sized song, but if you want to vote for it, do it.
8297118	8299320	This is the second pick in the Orange Lounge Cage Match.
8299360	8302003	This is the Secretions with I'm Gonna Get You So Laid.
8316344	8317125	Thanks for watching!
8357308	8359209	Take it to the money shop, boys!
8379978	8382782	Thank you very much for coming tonight.
8393271	8397113	Alright, that was the secretions with I'm Gonna Get You So Laid.
8397534	8399755	Let's go around the room and see what everyone thought of that.
8399795	8400015	Jamie?
8400035	8400755	We're talking about pain.
8401336	8402376	Anyway, the secretions.
8402396	8403377	What about the cage match pick?
8404337	8405018	Um, cool.
8405198	8406218	Um, seven.
8406519	8406859	Seven.
8407739	8408640	What'd you think of that, Zero?
8409881	8413182	Um, since I've heard that song before and I enjoyed it, I'll say an eight.
8413623	8413943	An eight.
8414323	8414984	Alright, Loki?
8415284	8420467	I'll give it a nine, but I know a lot of the chat room doesn't listen to punks, so they won't appreciate it as much as I do.
8421287	8423671	Well, gee, aren't we elitists when it comes to music?
8423771	8424412	Exactly.
8424892	8426434	All right, and Jonas, your pick.
8427035	8426434	7.5.
8427055	8429719	7.5.
8427135	8429719	I'm going to give it a 5.
8430019	8431121	I've heard better punk.
8431141	8436568	It was all right, but Little Bitch is better for DDR, but Pain is better than that.
8437709	8438469	It was alright.
8439410	8443611	If I was at a concert, I'd want to punch somebody to that song, so that's cool.
8443891	8446192	But it's not for Orange Lounge, though.
8446232	8447713	It ain't for Orange Lounge, I don't think.
8448513	8448993	We'll see.
8449913	8450333	We'll see.
8452334	8454735	Alright, so that's your other pick.
8454875	8455095	Alright.
8458817	8461800	We have Vincent Noir with Eternity, The Supretions, and I'm Gonna Get You So Late.
8461820	8462961	And here's the third pick.
8463402	8465404	And I don't have an artist for this one.
8465424	8466725	I'm trying to get that this week.
8466865	8473052	But this was actually given to me by our buddy Tal, who was here earlier in the show.
8473792	8475574	He had this posted on his website.
8475594	8478617	This is a song called The Terrible Mr. Grimshaw.
8478958	8479819	And what this is, this is...
8480419	8485001	They recorded some guy playing Counter-Strike or Half-Life or one of those life-killing games.
8485742	8492805	And they taped this guy playing it and swearing, and then they did a techno remix of it, and it kicks ass.
8493145	8494125	So you guys have to hear this.
8494366	8496066	This is my pick for the cage match this week.
8496086	8498968	This is the terrible Mr. Grimshaw here on Orange Lounge Radio.
8502242	8504303	Thank you for watching!
8573837	8574197	Goddammit!
8574497	8575217	Goddammit!
8575457	8576298	Goddammit!
8576418	8576798	Fuck!
8577418	8578298	Goddammit!
8578398	8579279	Goddammit!
8579379	8580299	Goddammit!
8580359	8580819	Fuck!
8581319	8582280	Goddammit!
8582320	8583200	Goddammit!
8583260	8584200	Goddammit!
8584240	8584660	Fuck!
8585200	8586201	Goddammit!
8586241	8587221	Goddammit!
8587241	8588041	Goddammit!
8588081	8589062	Motherfuck!
8589162	8590662	Goddamn!
8610181	8612263	Don't shoot at me!
8620491	8621012	Oh, come on!
8621052	8621852	Don't shoot at me!
8634502	8635542	I hate that!
8635902	8637043	Did I even get anyone?
8637083	8639603	Did I ever fucking kill anyone?
8639623	8640904	Did I even get anyone?
8640944	8644145	Did I ever fucking kill anyone?
8644165	8645465	Dude, what the fuck?
8645665	8647326	How did I get fucking shot?
8647586	8651367	Just quit shooting me the fucking fucking assholes, dude.
8651407	8653567	What the fuck happened?
8653907	8654648	Bullshit.
8654768	8657709	I fucking shot you like 50 fucking times!
8657809	8658049	Fuck!
8667182	8667984	Oh, my head!
8668024	8668385	Shit!
8668526	8668826	Fuck!
8700984	8703306	You know, I'm not fucking playing with any of you.
8705068	8708631	Alright, that was, I'm being told the name of the group.
8708651	8709932	Ooh, that's too loud.
8710612	8711913	Hi, I'm back.
8712714	8717778	The name of the group is the Murder Simulators, and that was the terrible Mr. Grimshaw.
8719140	8722342	Jamie already expressed her disgust for this song, but let's hear it.
8723826	8726771	If it had a good background music, I would give it a higher score.
8727292	8730357	If it was insecure, I would give it a higher score.
8730798	8734504	But I hear that all the time, just hanging out with Dan.
8735025	8737530	And hearing him talk shit on MechaSold on Xbox Live.
8738306	8739107	So I give that a 2.
8739207	8740768	You give it a 2.
8740808	8743391	Because at least parts of it weren't keyed.
8743871	8745633	Alright, 0.
8746854	8752859	I don't know, I've played quite a bit of Half-Life and Counter-Strike, so I can understand the guy's frustration.
8753440	8757824	So I'd say I'd give that a 6.5, purely by his frustration.
8758244	8759005	Alright, Loki.
8759765	8760987	Oh yeah, lead it, honky!
8763329	8763969	Love that line.
8766120	8783145	I'll give it like a 6 because it didn't even really, it doesn't look like they paid, they just were trying to put his samples in there just to make it like a song, but they didn't really pay much attention to the actual background music, so it's like, I don't know, 6, yeah.
8783686	8785246	Alright, Jonas, what'd you think?
8785446	8786246	I'll give it like a 4.
8786306	8791548	Well, first of all, there's really not much to the song at all.
8795211	8799513	I want to make a band and call it Slagwork.
8822972	8825653	If I started doing mixes, I would just go as flag one.
8825893	8828335	Vote now for the Orange Lounge Cage Match winner.
8828395	8829335	Here's your choices.
8829415	8832557	Last week's winner, Vincent Damore with Eternity.
8838479	8841241	The secretions with I'm Gonna Get You So Late.
8842741	8844042	And it's queuing up right now.
8844622	8845483	La la la.
8845883	8846283	Hurry up.
8849625	8849965	Dammit.
8850625	8850985	Shit.
8851125	8851426	Dammit.
8851466	8851726	Fuck.
8851766	8852066	Come on.
8852910	8854550	Oh my gosh.
8854730	8855491	Oh shit.
8855651	8861492	I can sing it.
8861592	8863253	Uh-oh.
8863873	8866793	I think that song just broke Orange Lounge Radio.
8867454	8867714	Don't!
8868034	8868414	Fuck.
8870654	8871194	Alright.
8871775	8875616	So... Boy, we're kind of screwed here.
8876096	8877036	Hold on just one sec.
8877396	8878036	I didn't do it!
8878576	8879596	Someone fill time here.
8879616	8880897	It wasn't me.
8887141	8889042	All right, so did Winamp close?
8889242	8889602	Hurry up.
8890563	8891503	Oh, shit.
8893725	8894425	All right, hold on.
8894785	8896506	Okay, we're not going to be able to play a... Uh-oh.
8896746	8898527	Did the whole computer just freeze up there?
8900789	8901249	Shit.
8903570	8905131	Loki, you broke Orange Lounge!
8905171	8905992	Here, pop the CDF.
8908133	8908794	This is bad.
8910293	8911334	This is fucked up.
8911354	8911874	Dude, move.
8912074	8913294	And let me pop the fucking CD out.
8913314	8913735	Where is it?
8914015	8914335	Right there.
8914355	8914755	Top one.
8914795	8915115	Top one.
8915335	8915756	Hold on.
8915796	8916676	We got technical issues.
8918597	8919177	We're sorry.
8919257	8922499	This broadcast of Orange Challenge Radio just got fucked up by Loki.
8923019	8923239	Sorry.
8923860	8925461	All right, there, finally, it's out.
8925481	8926222	The media has escaped.
8926262	8927683	Loki pulled it out, hooray.
8927703	8928444	Yay, we're fixed.
8928544	8931226	All right, so you can vote for the song that broke Orange Lounge.
8931286	8932447	We can now no longer breathe.
8933208	8939132	Or you can vote for, and now I, damn it, now, okay, or you can vote for the song with the swearing, The Terrible Mr. Grinchon.
8939152	8940674	You don't get to hear a clip of that either because I'm lazy.
8940694	8941174	I can hear mine, though.
8942950	8945411	Fuck, shit, cock!
8946511	8950932	Alright, so vote now, send those over private message to me, I'm Sky in the chatroom.
8951673	8958415	And if you're not in the chatroom, get your ass in there right now, orangelounge.skie.cx Alright, so, moving right along.
8958435	8959835	What do you guys want to talk about now?
8959855	8960955	There's a half hour left to show here.
8963816	8964436	I like liquor.
8965057	8965857	Okay, wait a minute, what?
8968002	8976045	I just started myself a little character in Jamie's Animal Crossing Town, and I can't get Irene to get off so I can play.
8976806	8983749	Go in there and tell her it's your goddamn turn, and that she plays it every time she's over here, and it's your turn, because you only get to be here like once every month, so... Yeah.
8984109	8984369	Ha.
8986110	8987570	Go lay the smack down, puppy.
8988651	8989071	Yeah.
8989491	8990172	Show him your bark.
8991932	8993033	Irene needs to be on the show.
8995692	8998014	Take it.
8998054	9000116	Yeah, we need more female input on this show.
9000737	9001257	Hey!
9001337	9002678	Jamie has to make up for everybody.
9003359	9004340	I have tit power.
9005961	9007002	I can pick a few females.
9008303	9009965	Let's have an all-female Orange Lounge.
9010906	9011226	Okay.
9011286	9012707	Loki and I will leave town for the weekend.
9013368	9014249	We already did that.
9014469	9015270	Oh, yeah, we did that.
9015290	9015710	That's right.
9015730	9016691	But Ross was there.
9016711	9019874	It was me and Jessica, but we had Ross and Dan.
9020959	9022981	Hey everybody, do you want Dan to be on the show again?
9023421	9024021	Samir Boots.
9024202	9025663	Yay!
9025923	9034690	You know Dan's going to be on there when we do the show at my house.
9035190	9036691	Buy my parrot hang gliders.
9042556	9044637	Oh, oh, oh, I know what I want to talk about.
9045318	9046799	This weird email I got.
9047458	9050361	Okay, now... Okay, you people fucking have no taste.
9050441	9051181	My God.
9051201	9054844	Okay, whoever you were, you have taste.
9054925	9055205	Oh, yeah.
9060595	9063857	Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck
9081730	9082811	Sorry, that's the twin mail.
9083291	9083771	No, twin mail.
9109759	9111060	Okay, here goes.
9111900	9121906	Dear friend, I know this email will reach you as a surprise, but need not to worry, as we are using the only secured and confidential medium available to seek foreign assistance.
9122367	9126889	Yeah, secure and confidential yet is going to someone else, and I got the email, supposedly.
9126930	9128490	Matt, why is your butt in my face?
9129411	9129731	I don't know.
9130412	9130732	Anyways.
9131807	9139894	So, following the sudden death of my husband, General Sonny Bacha, the late former head of State United... Give us a Cliff Notes version.
9140874	9143016	Okay, some guy died.
9143617	9148260	I want you to move my funds into the United States.
9148280	9149662	You made me snort my Propel.
9149722	9151743	I'll give you $21.5 million for doing that.
9154185	9163231	And all you have to do is send me your full name, your company name and address, and phone numbers and fax numbers.
9165032	9165432	And you're sold.
9167173	9167773	To my lawyer.
9168193	9169114	And a big black cock.
9169354	9172096	So that was the dumb email they got.
9172936	9176819	I thought it was all special and stuff, but then other people got the same email, so I guess not.
9180201	9180501	But yeah.
9183922	9184763	So, yeah.
9185403	9185823	That's all.
9185844	9187124	Pretty stupid.
9189426	9190327	Spam sucks.
9190707	9192989	Oh, that's what I was going to give an F you to this week and I forgot.
9193029	9194150	I got to see Robin drag.
9195311	9196832	Don't talk about that on this show.
9198053	9199354	Alright, you can talk about it if you want.
9199394	9200755	I got to see Robin drag.
9201796	9202416	It was cool.
9203537	9204478	I'm scarred for life.
9210047	9212287	We have dead airspace!
9212528	9216168	Sorry, I'm having to correct people that are voting for Loki's Legend of Max mix.
9216208	9217488	That wasn't the cage match!
9217528	9222669	That was a... We were just rating it like it was a cage match, but that wasn't really... We should have picked that as my cage match.
9223209	9223490	Damn it.
9223630	9227610	Oh, I gotta get Jahi's vote, because Jahi actually voted in the main charm, so he voted for that.
9227790	9230151	Ooh, it's... Down the wire!
9231671	9232431	Let's see, let's see.
9232451	9235132	Uh-oh.
9235772	9236492	Now it's tied.
9238792	9240413	We need people to hurry up and send their votes.
9241134	9243336	Jahi, I got your vote, so you don't have to send that over a message.
9243356	9243896	I already got it.
9244617	9244937	Alright.
9245758	9249862	We need... I mean... No, no, no.
9250002	9252163	We gotta wait and see if there's any more votes coming in the chatroom.
9252604	9254526	Because there's still some people in the chatroom who haven't voted yet.
9254686	9255386	Yeah, vote.
9255626	9256167	Vote for me.
9257028	9258229	So, it's... Oh, there's one.
9258889	9259410	Oh, let's see.
9262237	9264799	Oh, well, let's keep it open for a few more minutes.
9264819	9265399	We'll see what happens.
9265420	9265900	Okay.
9265940	9266200	Alright.
9266560	9268622	We'll give it ten seconds to get really good at it.
9268662	9268822	No, no, no.
9268862	9269162	Let's see.
9269502	9271124	Let's talk about something else.
9272365	9273806	How cool Vincent D'Amore is.
9275066	9277528	Vincent D'Amore is cool, but he doesn't swear in his songs.
9278489	9281531	He could swear in Icelandic or something.
9282412	9283472	He'd be cooler if he did.
9284313	9287215	No, just because something has swearing in it doesn't make it cool.
9287235	9288016	Oh, okay.
9289301	9291603	SoCal Kicks brings up a good thing we should talk about.
9291623	9297808	I briefly mentioned this after the Milpitas Golf Land interviews, but we are going to be going to Cyber Beat Nation, Orange Lounge Radio.
9297848	9299109	Well, at least I'm going.
9299149	9302252	Fuck them for scheduling it on Valentine's Day.
9302752	9303373	Yeah, you know what?
9303693	9308277	Since I'm the single one, Valentine's Day doesn't matter to me this year, so I'm going to go to L.A.
9308317	9310059	It's my five-year anniversary with Dan.
9310099	9311200	Well, congratulations, you guys.
9311220	9311860	That's really cute.
9311960	9312581	Give us presents.
9312601	9312901	Yeah.
9314474	9316976	Well, some other Bimani-related stuff.
9316996	9321059	They released a second code for DVR Extreme, if anyone cares.
9321099	9331746	You know, it releases Sync for Extreme, Twinbee, and also Burning the Floor Momo Mix, which is... Got the retarded speed-up in the middle.
9331966	9334148	That song would do very good in Tourney Mix 3.
9336910	9338131	Unnecessary speed-up.
9339572	9340092	But, you know.
9341573	9341893	So, yeah.
9344019	9345520	That's all.
9346801	9347802	Somebody else vote.
9349102	9350183	Jenny Bean hasn't voted.
9350223	9350723	Make her vote.
9350804	9351684	Jenny Bean, vote.
9352545	9353345	Who else hasn't voted?
9353405	9354506	North Thailand hasn't voted.
9354806	9356947	Vote for your fellow staff squad person.
9357608	9358308	Who hasn't voted?
9358348	9359329	Who am I going to single out here?
9359389	9360309	Excel hasn't voted.
9360529	9361230	Did Jahi vote?
9361450	9362190	Jahi did vote.
9363311	9363351	Um...
9365572	9366493	Did VidPower vote?
9366913	9368074	No, he did.
9369695	9370436	Slinky didn't vote.
9370516	9371557	Slinky, vote for me.
9372277	9372557	All right.
9373138	9375239	We're naming people now who haven't voted.
9375279	9376380	We're singling you out.
9376840	9377281	Oh, okay.
9377441	9378342	We got one from JB.
9378382	9378702	Here we go.
9381324	9382084	Oh, that wasn't a vote.
9383105	9383786	JB, vote.
9385067	9385707	JB, vote.
9385847	9386828	It's all on your shoulders.
9387849	9389950	Next vote is the final vote.
9389990	9392012	Next vote is the final vote.
9392532	9394454	And it's going to be the tiebreaker vote, possibly.
9396972	9399674	So everything is tied and the next vote breaks it.
9399734	9400594	Okay, here comes JB.
9402835	9403956	Damn it, that wasn't a vote.
9404576	9407118	Jenny Bean votes for... She didn't put anything.
9407938	9408779	Alright, that's it.
9410159	9411600	Jenny Bean breaks the tie.
9411620	9413861	The page match is over.
9415342	9416583	For the second week in a row.
9418493	9418993	It wins.
9419594	9420194	Nice try.
9420615	9422836	USFEB tried cloning himself to vote again.
9423677	9426139	Nice try, but you were five seconds too late, unfortunately.
9426239	9429121	So, Eternity wins again for the second week.
9429601	9434645	And, uh... The Grimshaw one will just have to be saved for the occasional fuck-off show.
9434665	9435305	Sorry, kids.
9436126	9438908	But yes, I'll send that to you guys that wanted it after the show.
9439048	9440469	Or you can visit Tal's website.
9440509	9444232	He has it, but... Ask Tal when he comes back in the chatroom where his website is, because that's where I got it from.
9444792	9445032	Okay.
9446153	9447074	So the cage match is over.
9447454	9448194	Eternity wins again.
9448214	9449635	Play it again.
9449675	9451456	What do you mean, play it again?
9452596	9453457	Play it again, Rob.
9453897	9454777	I'm not going to play it again.
9455778	9456738	It already won, dammit.
9458359	9461641	If you want to take a huge break, we can play E-Fly.
9461881	9463382	I don't want to play that 9 minute song, no way.
9465069	9465970	I don't think any of us will say this.
9465990	9466430	Alright, here it is.
9466510	9470212	Alright, we got it.
9470452	9470953	Hey!
9472133	9472554	Alright.
9473994	9475375	You're just jealous.
9475475	9476816	Yes, that's right, I am jealous.
9477156	9477637	Fuck!
9477997	9478537	Shit!
9479478	9481639	This kick to Rob's knee was brought to you by Propel.
9482360	9482540	Ow!
9484401	9484681	Alright.
9486882	9489444	Anyway, moving along.
9489464	9490965	Moving right along.
9491864	9496326	Moving on up, moving on up to this Muppet movie.
9496626	9497726	Mmm, tastes like Muppet.
9500087	9500507	Anything else?
9500607	9504548	Oh, that's a good erotic song title.
9504568	9505249	Tastes like Muppet.
9505289	9506069	Tastes like Muppet.
9508610	9509510	Um, what else?
9509650	9512771	Is there anything like... Treat me like a Muppet and stick your hand up my ass.
9515859	9516859	Puppet like a Muppet.
9520621	9522321	I'm sure you guys could be very creative.
9522361	9523582	Ah, such a busy schedule.
9523642	9525042	EOSFBB says, taste like Muppet.
9528524	9529404	Rock the cock.
9530064	9531905	Alright, we did the erotic thing like an hour ago.
9531985	9532385	Moving on.
9533486	9536487	You know that candy cane still makes me think of that Jay and Silent Bob comic.
9536827	9537047	What?
9537107	9537407	What one?
9537807	9543189	The one where Dante went to see Caitlyn in the asylum and started fucking her with a candy cane.
9543589	9545110	And she woke up and chased him out.
9547034	9550937	I need to watch the Clerks cartoon series again, just because it rules so much.
9551838	9552399	Is it safe?
9554080	9555061	It's very safe.
9556642	9557964	Has anybody seen any- Let's see!
9560966	9561947	Is it safe?
9563348	9565450	Has there been any DDR on TV lately?
9566311	9567011	Like on a show?
9567212	9567512	No.
9567712	9570735	Like I heard it was on Fastlane like three months ago, but that's such old news.
9571175	9574278	They're gonna be airing a Slurpee Nation commercial on TV.
9575604	9576165	On TV?
9577305	9577625	Where?
9579687	9582849	It's a commercial, but that doesn't mean it's a real commercial.
9583889	9585991	It just seemed like a DDR ego thing.
9586711	9589193	I thought that was just an online commercial.
9590193	9591895	I don't think they're actually going to air it, no.
9592535	9593356	Where would they air it?
9593456	9594076	Assfucker?
9596648	9603373	Oh my god though, I did download a cool, I mean it's an old commercial, but it was like the one of this Nike shoe that they're wearing in Japan.
9604114	9604594	No, Nike.
9605475	9611479	It's this guy walking past a gigantic shoe in front of a billboard, and all of a sudden the shoe transforms into a robot and flies off.
9612360	9613921	And the guys are standing there going, blink.
9614341	9616223	But they made a toy of that, like ten of them.
9617484	9620306	And they were giving them to executives and had one in a giveaway prize, I want one.
9622689	9625211	That was also in a magazine for, uh, Spin Magazine.
9625251	9629635	It came with the little flipbook, and it had, like, had it turn into a football player, though.
9629795	9630836	But it was pretty much the same thing.
9631336	9632698	It also, like, turned into, like, a Gundam.
9634419	9635840	That's what the football player looked like, though.
9636221	9638663	And he, like, jumped up and flew away for no apparent reason.
9638683	9643747	This guy's just standing there on the other side of the fence going, Well, what do you know?
9644107	9644888	Shoot turned into a robot.
9645706	9646807	Ask Orange Lounge
9672566	9672966	Oh, okay.
9673066	9673867	While you're waiting.
9673887	9674827	All right, all right, fine.
9674847	9675547	I think it's in there still.
9675567	9676228	Is it already in there?
9676288	9676648	All right.
9676868	9678769	So send us those questions to me in the chat room.
9678789	9687172	You can ask Orange Lounge, or you can ask Zero, you can ask Jonas, or alternatively, you can ask Brad and Irene out in the front room.
9687192	9687912	You can ask any of us.
9687932	9688813	Actually, I have a better song.
9688953	9690113	Or Puppy, or Ryan.
9690733	9691634	The Fly isn't that good.
9691834	9694875	We can play, I've got Gennaro in there that's really good.
9695095	9695575	Okay.
9695616	9698157	That was going to be my Cage Match song, but it's nine minutes long.
9698177	9698577	Well, you know what?
9698617	9700578	No, we're doing our Journey to the Wonderland song, so that's what we always do.
9700598	9701378	All right, fine.
9703467	9704548	Alright, so ask Orange Lounge.
9704568	9705729	Send me those questions in the chat room.
9707891	9710453	You can ask Orange Lounge or you can ask any of our guests.
9711474	9711875	Here we go.
9715338	9716319	Really?
9717720	9718981	Why am I so fly?
9720082	9721143	Why am I so sexy?
9721223	9721964	Is that why you're asking?
9722024	9722585	Alright, well let's...
9728488	9730089	Why are you so fly for a white guy?
9730729	9731929	My last name is white man.
9732149	9733250	Okay, first question.
9733630	9737231	And people, don't send me your questions over slash notice.
9737291	9740132	It's got to come over slash MSG because I might miss them.
9740412	9742613	But I caught this one, so we'll start with this question.
9742993	9749275	SoCalKicks wants to know, Can SoCalKicks be a special super duper derpity derp host at CBN?
9751575	9753676	He can be our local chorus watcher.
9753716	9754817	I don't see why not.
9754857	9755537	Yeah, he can be the local...
9757119	9758180	This is what I'm thinking.
9758700	9766884	I'm thinking since there's going to be so much to talk about, so many different people to talk about Cyber Beat Nation, to maybe make it its own... We could be an intern.
9766904	9770386	Well, I'm thinking of having the Cyber Beat Nation interview be like its own show.
9770526	9772967	Like, not normally, not a normal Sunday at 6.30.
9773007	9780991	By the way, because we said we would, before I forget, we do have to introduce Black Lab as our foreign correspondent for the People's Republic of Davis.
9781391	9782072	Oh, yes, good.
9782932	9786014	Is there any news to report from the People's Republic of Davis foreign correspondent?
9786414	9786494	Um...
9787711	9789192	It's still as boring as ever.
9789212	9790153	Uh-huh.
9790634	9792515	Um... I heard you almost got run over by a cop.
9792816	9793556	Yeah.
9793676	9795198	Damn cops.
9795618	9795918	Yeah.
9796639	9797560	It's all a conspiracy.
9797700	9799101	See, they're trying to take me out.
9800322	9805507	It's because, um... A couple days ago when I was going out late, and I had to go to the A.M.
9805527	9805727	P.M.
9805747	9806227	to get food.
9806287	9808749	Because the damn dining hall was closed early.
9808769	9808809	Um...
9811331	9820816	I was leaving on my bike, and three cop cars come screeching into the gas station parking lot with no lights or sirens on, and one of them almost hit me.
9822036	9823257	And, yeah, things suck.
9826481	9829825	Remember, it's the People's Republic of Davis where they'll find you for reading.
9831066	9832367	This is CBN.
9833428	9842538	What I'm thinking, and I need to know what the other hosts think of this, instead of airing the interviews during a show, maybe have it be its own special that airs Friday night or something.
9843198	9843879	Sure, why not?
9844019	9844399	Why not?
9844499	9846820	I'm thinking of doing like a reality radio thing.
9846860	9848320	Like actually doing a journal.
9848660	9850701	Like saying, hey, it's Friday morning and we're leaving.
9850881	9854562	Because I'm going down there with Mel B, and he's always a colorful character to have on the show.
9854802	9856582	Brad and Irene might possibly tag along.
9856622	9861144	We all know Brad's funnier than hell, and Irene will probably be playing Animal Crossing, so she won't say anything anyway.
9861984	9862744	But I'm thinking about doing that.
9863044	9865425	I wish I could go, but I'm having an empty house the whole weekend.
9865825	9870306	So yes, SoCalKicks, you can be some kind of special, super-duper correspondent there.
9872134	9874077	and in the background we'll have the Atari 5200 going.
9874137	9874357	Alright.
9874378	9878804	But I have one of those too and I do have combat.
9883030	9890136	EOSFBB wants to know when will Orange Lounge have the next match game?
9890156	9891677	We were going to do one tonight.
9904208	9908152	But everything else ran too long because we had the Milpitas interviews and the fuck yous went on forever.
9908313	9910635	So we'll try and get to one next week.
9910855	9911135	Okay?
9911356	9911976	We'll do one next week.
9911996	9912957	We'll do one next week for you.
9913238	9913758	We'll show.
9914799	9915120	All right.
9915240	9921066	Snub Dishnoid wants to know, how would one go about passing Rhythm and Patty?
9922707	9923408	Oh, is that an edit?
9923468	9924269	Oh, that's the edit.
9924449	9925470	Loki, tell us about this.
9926531	9932918	Rhythm and Patty, or R and Patty, was Orange Beanie's third place winner, I believe.
9934479	9935901	Third place for the Hell edits.
9936161	9940505	If you want to try passing it, play it in the first stage, and play your first stage on Beginner.
9940565	9942688	You cannot fail Beginner, the first stage.
9943348	9951610	So just play the edit, make sure it's set to beginner mode, and you can try it as many times as you want on the first stage, and you can't fail it.
9951990	9957452	But he did it, and I was surprised, like holy shit, he like got an A on it or something.
9958032	9960313	Yeah, so it's a lot of stamina, but that's about it.
9961973	9972718	I still think the one for Era was cooler, because it followed the 2DX steps, well, whatever, the rhythm of the keys.
9972778	9976120	I was like, I heard it, and I was like, oh my god, it's 2DX.
9976300	9982122	Well, what won it over the other ones was the crowd reaction for it, because, you know, everyone was around like, oh, that's so cool.
9982282	9983183	So, yeah, it's cool.
9983823	9985083	Alright, moving on, next question?
9985623	9989064	Alright, next question, this one comes from Jahi, Jay Kinetic, our buddy.
9989544	9992745	Jay Kinetic wants to know, when did Rob first get laid and how was it?
9993285	9996846	Well, we did pass your virginity on the way to SoCal.
9996866	10002167	Yes, for those that don't know, my virginity is actually two exits before Milpitas Golf Land.
10003987	10006108	And this is really ironic, no, this is really ironic.
10006855	10009997	I've lost my virginity the same weekend I saw DDR for the first time.
10010398	10011598	Like, many years ago.
10011879	10013460	Like, it was 1.5 minutes.
10013480	10014641	Like a long... Like two.
10015001	10015281	Yeah.
10015761	10017382	So, uh, and how was it?
10018123	10020845	Uh, sorry to say, I've had much better since.
10022326	10025668	So, you all can wave when you're past Mission Boulevard.
10025688	10026869	There's a Motel 6 right there.
10026889	10028090	Just wave at it.
10028270	10028470	Yeah.
10029331	10030712	I can't believe I just said that on the radio.
10030732	10031873	My mother's crying somewhere.
10031953	10032293	Alright.
10033634	10034194	Moving on.
10035735	10036336	Jenny Bean.
10037481	10047248	Can DCB and I be special non-Cyberbeat Nation interview hosts if we figure out how to record them for the people that don't know, that don't get to go to Cyberbeat Nation?
10047288	10047869	Ha ha ha.
10049090	10049990	Okay, sure, why not?
10050491	10050891	Okay.
10051031	10052532	Alright, you guys want to record something?
10052572	10056095	I'm not going by choice because I have my 5th year anniversary and I'm going to.
10059344	10061627	I'm just going to get laid.
10062007	10071257	Anyways, yeah, gee, I wish I could be crammed into a nice small Korean arcade with tons of people there and it being all hot and stuff and crowded.
10073560	10076062	Wait, no, that was... No, sorry, don't want to go.
10078965	10083050	All right, so I wanted to go just to go to the Price is Right.
10083110	10083751	God damn it.
10083811	10085853	That's the only thing.
10086093	10088035	I don't think Mel and I are going to have time to go to Price is Right.
10088576	10088816	So...
10090891	10091731	We have our Olivia back!
10091751	10091811	Yay!
10091851	10092212	Olivia's gone!
10092252	10092532	I'm so happy.
10092552	10096493	We have Olivia back and she's going to give me lots of stuff.
10119289	10120030	We got Lee back.
10120070	10120651	Yay!
10120731	10121231	I'm so happy.
10121251	10121331	Good.
10121351	10122292	You can have the bitch.
10122552	10122913	Alright.
10123093	10123393	Wow.
10124054	10124294	Wow.
10124354	10125596	Happy day in Animal Crossing.
10125756	10126677	Oh, happy day.
10126697	10128018	You can have that little chick back.
10128058	10128298	Alright.
10128338	10128659	Here we go.
10128699	10129099	Moving on.
10129680	10131161	Quit traveling between villagers.
10131181	10133844	We're going to lose all of our villagers if you guys keep doing the traveling.
10133884	10134064	Alright.
10134545	10134905	Moving on.
10134965	10135266	Shadow.
10137208	10140751	Hey Loki, can we make you into one of those Virtu thingies for Step Mania?
10140831	10143953	You and your burning hair jumping out from the left hand side of the screen.
10145994	10146635	Oh, let me grow my hair.
10146655	10147235	Yelling toasty.
10147355	10151058	Well, let me grow out my hair a little bit longer so it's like really messed up and stuff.
10151258	10156082	You can get me dressed up for like, um, cause in Phantom Man I'm gonna be cosplaying as Oolong the bunny.
10156702	10163707	So, so, so you can get a picture of me with a pancake on my head and, uh, yeah, that'd be funny.
10164708	10165749	I'll cosplay as Oolong too.
10167734	10170378	Rob, do you mind if I cosplay with you?
10171399	10172721	Go right ahead.
10172741	10174263	We're going to cosplay as Ulan, and you know what?
10174323	10177628	I found those old rabbit fur coats from the 80s.
10178309	10181393	Since they're already dead and made into coats, we can just cut them up.
10181854	10182334	That'd be cool.
10184076	10184676	Oh my lord.
10184776	10188677	Alright, Strong Brad wants to know, can we spot him for Cyber Beat Nation?
10189318	10189478	No.
10189858	10191238	Alright, moving on.
10192459	10197620	Sorry, you know, we're poor enough, it's hard enough for me to get down there, Christ.
10198240	10202562	VidPawa wants to know, how are your guys' PlayStation 2s modded, if they are modded at all?
10202962	10206123	Also, if they are modded, did you do it yourself or did someone else do it for you?
10206203	10206523	Pierre?
10207342	10207982	I'm not cheap.
10208342	10209383	I bought a JPS2.
10209563	10211064	I also bought a JPS2.
10212084	10216186	I attempted to mod mine with a plug mod that's internal.
10216506	10222868	And ever since I tried doing that, every now and then it doesn't want to load my GameShark CD and I have to reboot it.
10222968	10228791	But I have three plug mods that are supposedly going to work in some version of the PS2.
10228911	10229971	I just don't have one.
10229991	10231172	I need to get rid of them.
10231972	10238260	The money you're going to spend attempting all those various mod chips, you might as well just crack and get the JPS2.
10238360	10245710	Keep in mind this, is that for every mod that comes out, with every new game that comes out, it has protection.
10246290	10249655	So, like, say that you want the next 2DX to come out, it ain't gonna work.
10250572	10251973	Just, you know, save yourself some time.
10251993	10253935	You can get a Japanese PlayStation 2 for cheap.
10254135	10258239	And from what I understand, if anything ever happens to a network video, just serve a secret JPS2.
10259179	10266606	Uh, word of advice, don't use mod chips on your PS2s because, exactly what Jamie said, Sony can fuck them up.
10266726	10267887	I'll laugh at you.
10268307	10275053	So, you know, maybe there'll be a super special secret one that'll get through someday, but honestly, just get the JPS2 and save yourself the headache.
10275473	10278316	They're going to have one that works for everything after the system's already obsolete.
10278336	10278537	Yep.
10278557	10280659	Which it is, technically.
10281260	10282801	Moving on to EOSFBB.
10282942	10283602	Oh, dear God.
10283622	10286486	He's giving us a website and asking us the impressions of the site.
10288668	10292532	And I'm really scared whenever EOSFBB sends me a fucking website.
10292552	10292873	All right.
10293974	10295496	Kama Sutra Animated.
10295516	10295716	Hmm.
10298288	10298708	I will.
10300429	10301089	Interesting.
10301429	10302970	We'll look at it more in depth a little later.
10303030	10305030	We've got a bunch more questions to get to.
10305050	10308351	I like the animated picture of the right in the cock there.
10308371	10309332	That's very interesting.
10309612	10311432	That might be my new icon on TDR Free.
10311472	10312633	What do you think?
10313733	10314173	Oh, wait.
10314253	10315273	I might get a point for that.
10315394	10316214	It'd get removed.
10316254	10317674	You'd have 24 hours to remove it.
10317714	10318034	Damn it.
10318775	10320715	Well, for that 24 hours, it would be hilarious.
10320795	10321015	All right.
10321576	10323436	Moving on.
10323596	10326037	23rd Magus, can we call you a boo-boo kitty fuck?
10327077	10329278	If you were asking that question to Loki, sure.
10329838	10333900	Actually, that's my backup name for when my name was taken or something.
10333920	10334800	That's where it appears at.
10335360	10340462	Actually, someone in the Fruits community's name is BooBooKittyFuck, the legend community.
10340782	10343263	Yeah, I remember seeing a name called BooBooKittyFuck.
10343843	10344124	All right.
10345124	10347785	DCB has a question, and it's, hi, guys.
10348425	10348565	Hi.
10349426	10349766	Hi.
10352079	10353100	This is the police.
10353841	10356724	DCB, put the joke down.
10357004	10358606	Step away from the joke.
10359246	10360928	Hi Dad, I'm in jail.
10361949	10363030	Alright, moving on.
10363831	10367035	SoCalKicks wants to know, will you buy me a PlayStation 2 Japanese?
10367215	10367395	No.
10367615	10367775	No.
10368456	10368957	Moving on.
10370566	10374168	Damn it, the Matrix is 102 days away, it's 102 days too long.
10374188	10381431	Alright, Jay Kinetic wants to know, Does anyone know where I can get Japanese hip-hop and R&B romanji lyrics?
10382031	10385673	Where is the Lucifer pic that DarkSakura was supposed to send me, and who's hotter?
10386698	10388999	Yoji Kudo or Irvine Kinase?
10389299	10391100	I fucked that up because I'm too honky, sorry.
10391280	10393120	Alright, here's what I have to say.
10393621	10399703	As far as the lyrics, I had stuff, but I'll have to go find the sites again.
10400183	10405165	As far as the pic of Lucifer, my hard drive was broken a few weeks ago.
10405685	10408206	So that means that I have to find it for you again.
10409066	10410187	But just look up Angel Sanctuary.
10410207	10411728	There's actually a really good Japanese set.
10411748	10413470	They've got tons of good Lucifer pictures.
10414050	10417012	And as far as Yoji or Irvine... Irvine, dude!
10417352	10425058	Just the hair, the trench coat, the shotgun hat... The only redeeming quality of playing Final Fantasy VIII.
10425098	10425679	Yeah, I agree.
10425999	10429301	Irvine's hotter, because that was the only redeeming quality of Final Fantasy VIII.
10429321	10433725	Well, Squall was pretty hot, even though he had the personality of a pancake.
10433745	10435366	Squall was a panty, okay!
10436818	10441101	Oh, DCB claims that I love Derby Owners Club more than I love us.
10441521	10444703	Meaning Orange Lounge, I suppose, or more than the Killer Pals or something like that.
10445464	10449086	To be truthful, yes, I do love Derby Owners Club more than any of you.
10449527	10450848	Sorry, it's just the way it is.
10451208	10451868	No, I'm kidding.
10452469	10453029	Nice question.
10453069	10453669	It's just a game.
10453970	10456071	Sure, I spent 20 bucks on it the other day, but hey, you know.
10456091	10458633	Why can't they have Hookers Owners Club, okay?
10458693	10462015	I want to be a pimp and be able to raise my hookers to be the best prostitutes in the world.
10462335	10463256	Why can't they have that?
10464116	10466018	I could totally see that if it would be this golf land.
10470999	10472140	Ah, good question.
10472780	10478162	Angel is asking this, but he says it's actually Jay Kinetic's question that I liked, but he didn't send it over PM.
10478742	10482283	What's everyone's favorite sushi among the Orange Lounge Radio staff?
10482603	10483944	Gold or nigiri.
10484924	10485164	Either.
10486249	10503356	Okay, for rolls, my favorite roll would have to be, at this point, the twin dragon roll at Shia, which is like six types of fish wrapped around, of course, the rice, the nori, and fried lobster tail with this really yummy sauce.
10503436	10510319	And then my favorite nigiri roll is, at this time, I would have to say toro, which is patty tuna.
10511974	10512875	I like toast.
10515836	10516997	No, I don't like sushi at all.
10517217	10520579	I've never tried it, but, you know, me being a picky eater, I don't like sushi.
10520659	10523140	It just doesn't look good to me.
10523160	10523700	Sorry to hear that.
10524541	10527422	Alright, we're going to take the last few questions here.
10528003	10528803	Oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
10528823	10529683	What's your favorite roll?
10529743	10534006	My favorite roll is Sacramento rolls, deep fried California rolls, because they're fattening and good.
10534026	10534846	What's your favorite single roll?
10535386	10536167	Favorite single roll?
10536467	10538108	Have you had any before, like a nagi taco roll?
10538971	10540754	Like the sashimi?
10543497	10546681	Um, I'd say unagi.
10546842	10548023	Rob likes the eel.
10548163	10548744	I do like the eel.
10548784	10549405	It's long.
10549886	10552369	Alright, we're closing the question asking now.
10552389	10553931	We're going to take the last few questions here.
10559474	10559955	Ooh, dead air.
10560115	10560615	Sorry about that.
10560635	10562797	Alright, last question.
10563458	10565440	Aw, dammit, it's another will you buy me question.
10565680	10568863	RYC3 wants to know, will you buy me a Universal PS2?
10569484	10570685	No, there's no such thing.
10571206	10571526	Alright.
10573268	10573728	That's it.
10575830	10578793	No more questions, although I want to put in this website that DCB just posted.
10578833	10579854	I'm kind of scared of it, though.
10582542	10584186	Columbia, the shuttle tragedy.
10585189	10586733	It's a screencap from CNN.
10586793	10590062	It says, shuttle traveling nearly 18 times speed of light.
10593479	10599421	Do the salt and pepper shakers on Blue's Clues actually hold cocaine and heroin?
10614148	10616070	That's a total inside joke from Friday, yes.
10616971	10621915	I want to watch Buffy.
10623076	10625117	DarkTetsuya wants to know a good place to pick up girls.
10626779	10627179	Online.
10627299	10627640	Online.
10630290	10640158	and last question, last question there are no girls online, they're all 40 year old men last question, SoCalKicks wants to know do you think Ali Larder would be a good Samus for the Metroid movie?
10641439	10644622	that chick from Final Destination what movie was that?
10644762	10649286	I don't watch that movie I didn't even hear of Final Destination was she in Bring It On?
10649306	10651888	no she wasn't in Bring It On what other movie was she in?
10653109	10657973	there was another big I watched movies that don't suck Final Destination wasn't that bad
10660231	10661231	What else was she in?
10662312	10663432	Would she be good, Samus?
10663712	10664593	Eh, she'd be okay.
10664633	10668454	It would be better than fucking Angelina Jolie or Mira.
10668654	10672075	Just fucking... We need to get away from those people.
10674456	10675276	Oh, thank you.
10675336	10677217	Okay, Allie Larder wasn't Jay and Silent Bob.
10677537	10678677	She was the chick that farted.
10679678	10680918	Oh!
10681038	10684859	No, no, she's too... You know who?
10685400	10685760	They need...
10688286	10688807	No, no, no.
10689247	10690869	First of all, Samus has green hair.
10692751	10694933	They're going to be making a Metroid movie, yes.
10695253	10698636	Samus needs to be a freaking powerful looking woman.
10698657	10701139	Samus is supposed to be like seven feet tall.
10701179	10701559	China.
10702661	10706344	I'm wondering why... Dude, China would be a fucking kick-ass Samus.
10708286	10709047	Lucy Lawless.
10709107	10709407	Yeah.
10710968	10713069	or the chick that played Gabrielle.
10713109	10716650	I want my Samus to have lesbian connotations, Samus.
10717610	10722412	No, I was wondering why... I mean, I've seen a lot of really shitty-ass movies.
10722452	10727993	I mean, for instance, I've given out some of those for the... Black Ninja, okay?
10728353	10729494	Really shitty-ass movies.
10729634	10731194	Why hasn't the DDR movie come out?
10731214	10734355	I mean, even some really cheap-ass studio could pick this stuff up.
10734495	10735636	I mean, for next to nothing.
10736916	10746923	I'm just surprised that it hasn't been, like, released.
10747143	10750625	I'm still voting for Lucy Lawless to be Samus.
10751365	10753147	Yeah, Lucy Lawless would kick ass.
10753527	10758250	And SoCalKicks is stomping and pouting because he said he saw the end of Metroid Prime and she's a blonde.
10759409	10766796	Um, actually, so in Super Metroid, but I'm referring to the first Metroid, if you put in the code, Justin Bailey, Samus has green hair.
10767356	10768277	So, eh.
10768718	10771761	And, you know, Justin Bailey is not actually a name.
10772221	10774383	It's actually referring to just wearing underwear.
10775244	10775864	Woo!
10775964	10776565	It's an Australian.
10776825	10777005	Ow!
10777386	10781309	Because Bailey is a piece.
10781710	10783251	So that's where it came from, Justin Bailey.
10785621	10787722	Yes, I'm full of old video game knowledge.
10787962	10788382	Sue me.
10788742	10790603	I have to go through my list, but no one cares.
10791063	10791343	Hurry up.
10791363	10792083	Go through your list.
10792243	10792463	Do it.
10792684	10793624	It would take me a long time.
10794004	10794964	You want to save it for next week, then?
10795444	10796245	I'll go through the list.
10796265	10797325	Who wants to know what I have?
10797745	10798045	Do it.
10798565	10798865	Okay.
10799166	10799986	I do not have Jaguar.

10827327	10827967	The new GBA.

10890248	10891469	I have a Turbo Duo.
10893050	10894490	Um, think about TurboDuo, it's awesome.
10895191	10900192	As long as you use good quality CDs, you can play a game no matter, you can copy games on them, no matter the country code.
10900432	10902432	Because there's no country lockout, no copy lockout.
10902873	10905833	So, I had, let's play Dracula, I actually have Dracula X now in original.
10906854	10909734	Um, I have, um, a Nintendo 64.
10910674	10910955	Somewhere.
10912175	10913115	I don't know what I did with it.
10913255	10914235	I think it's paperweight somewhere.

10933093	10934913	I have an Xbox.
10935833	10942315	Um, I have, I do not have a 3DO, but we almost bought a CD-i right before Game Masters went out of business.
10943596	10946217	Um, I have a Kinectrix.
10946437	10947237	We're looking for a Vectrex.
10949836	10950776	Um, Mattel?
10950836	10951657	Which one did Mattel do?
10951677	10955578	Wasn't that the Intellivision?
10955598	10956398	I almost bought a Pico.
10956418	10957599	I thought that was the Intellivision.
10957619	10958259	The Sega Pico?
10959479	10961700	Because they were selling it for 10 bucks when I was at Mobile.
10963761	10966642	Um, I have a Neo Geo cartridge system.
10967322	10968202	I have a Neo Geo CD.
10970183	10971163	You know how Dan got that?
10971303	10975465	Dan got our Neo card by trading a Sega CD for it.
10977734	10979876	Back then, they didn't know, because of the thing.
10980357	10985182	And we actually are still picking up our cartridges, plus we picked up this KOF 2000.
10985222	10985823	How much was that?
10986684	10987825	We got it for just over $300.
10987865	10992190	What else do I have?
10992851	10994012	Oh yeah, I have a Wonderswan color.
10994973	10997356	We have two Neo Geo Pocket colors and a Neo Geo Pocket.
10998837	11004361	and, um, I might have exhausted the list if there's anything else I don't remember because I know I've got other stuff.
11004781	11005241	Okay.
11005661	11007622	So... Wow, you own a lot.
11007662	11008903	That's like 40-something, I think.
11009744	11010284	Disgusting!
11010884	11011104	Oh well.
11011905	11012265	But fun.
11012565	11014226	Your house is a video game museum, it really is.
11014907	11018749	And don't forget the Transformers and Valkyries that are littering my house.
11021539	11022179	Seriously.
11022860	11027566	I'm afraid because the movie pile that I have in my house is starting to creep towards my bed, and I think it's coming after me.
11027726	11028007	Yikes.
11028768	11029589	Okay, we've got to wrap this show.
11029609	11030870	We're already running like five minutes late.
11031391	11032693	Any final thoughts from you folks?
11032993	11033474	I want Boba.
11034295	11034915	Jamie wants Boba.
11035751	11036211	You know what, though?
11036291	11039872	I've got to get back here, like, fast, so if we go get Bubba, we just have to go get Bubba and go.
11039912	11040512	We can't really stay.
11040772	11042213	I need to finish my website.
11042933	11045353	Yeah, that's why I've got to work on another website for somebody else.
11045793	11046594	Zero, any final thoughts?
11046614	11047334	Thanks for being here tonight.
11047974	11048334	No problem.
11048534	11049574	I'd come back whenever you wanted.
11049794	11049955	Cool.
11050795	11051155	I don't know.
11051655	11053755	I would say if I was Willy Wonka, I would be really rich.
11054136	11059777	And for the simple knowledge bands that don't know what I mean by get the fat kid out of my chocolate milk, and that's it.
11061673	11063994	Rock, Jonas, any final thoughts?
11064094	11064954	Well, not much.
11064974	11066494	I haven't spoken as usual as much.
11066974	11070035	But, um, I'll be back next week again.
11071216	11071496	Cool.
11072296	11073376	This time probably on time.
11073716	11075657	You can play match game next week.
11077337	11077797	Oh, sure.
11079118	11081058	Alright, be ready at 5 o'clock or so, maybe.
11084119	11084759	Yeah, they can't hear you.
11085059	11087120	That was just dead air.
11087280	11089461	I'm going to come back with them because I'll be ready at 5 o'clock.
11089481	11089541	Hey.
11092187	11093187	I don't really have a final thought.
11094008	11094568	Life sucks.
11094608	11095268	Go kill yourself.
11095828	11096188	Hey!
11096408	11097008	Just kidding.
11097668	11099309	I didn't mean to look at you when I said that, Jamie.
11099329	11100129	You don't need to kill yourself.
11100149	11100509	You're fine.
11102329	11102629	All right.
11102649	11103549	Life sucks when you grow up.
11103990	11104410	That's it.
11104550	11104770	All right.
11104790	11105150	Later, Jonas.
11105170	11105630	Thanks for being here.
11105650	11106290	Bye.
