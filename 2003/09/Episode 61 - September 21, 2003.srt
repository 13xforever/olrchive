1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Toto? I have a feeling we're not in Kansas anymore.

2
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:21,000
You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio, the Monty Talk and then some.

3
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Uh, mostly the and then some part of that.

4
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Orange Lounge Radio is created by a bunch of potty-mouthed adults.

5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Orange Lounge may contain sexual, perverted, and mildly retarded content.

6
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
You probably shouldn't let your children listen to Orange Lounge Radio.

7
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Yes, I will spank your child.

8
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
If you're not going to do your job, goddammit, I will.

9
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Well, here's to my big opening.

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
A sphincter says why?

11
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm super. Thanks for asking.

12
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,400
You little bitch troll from hell!

13
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:57,600
What am I doing here?

14
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,100
Haha!

15
00:00:58,100 --> 00:00:59,700
Nooo!

16
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:00,200
Eh?

17
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:01,000
Dodge this.

18
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Mm-hmm.

19
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,100
This is a tasty burger.

20
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:05,400
Look, you stupid bastard!

21
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,800
You've got no arms left!

22
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:07,800
Yes, I have!

23
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:08,700
Look!

24
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:09,900
There's a flesh wound.

25
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:12,800
Searching for a boy in high school is that useless.

26
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:17,000
It's searching for meaning in a polyshore.

27
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Oh, yeah?

28
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Well...

29
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,600
I hope your babies look like monkeys.

30
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:22,800
Dark Sakura.

31
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:26,800
I had a sniff, but I'm playing it for the bartender, so suffer.

32
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:28,800
Loki, I hate you.

33
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:32,800
Orange Lounge Radio.

34
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:36,800
We are live, finally.

35
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:39,800
And this is episode number 61.

36
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:41,800
Well, at least a fraction of it.

37
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:45,800
The first 20 minutes is gone forever, but that's okay, we didn't do them.

38
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:53,800
For September the 21st of 2003, you're tuned in to Bamani Scene's most comcast-hating radio station of all things B-Mani.

39
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:57,800
My name is Rob Roberts, but you might know me as Sky. Joining me, as always, are my awesome co-hosts.

40
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:02,800
In this corner, the happiest bunny on the farm is Jamie Summers. You know her better as Stark Sakura.

41
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,800
There's nothing on my face.

42
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,800
She's too busy playing dance summit right now.

43
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:11,800
Well, you know, we have other things going on like the show that's more important.

44
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,800
The game will have to come later.

45
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,560
uh... in that corner

46
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:20,640
it's mother say hello to protect that's a low-key

47
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:27,460
you can't play play that they had been able to do something without a show

48
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:29,400
why does knowing indoors

49
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:32,400
uh... so i don't know i just knowing that battle for god i thought you were

50
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,380
talking about real life i was like what the hell is stealing

51
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:42,100
yes robert still outside that you know special one hundred degrees

52
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:46,100
We know! Turn it off!

53
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:50,100
No, you didn't want to talk when you had the mic, so nah!

54
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:54,100
Bitch.

55
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:58,100
I like Dance Summit. Okay, next.

56
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:03,100
Alright. We're not going to take an opening break tonight, we're just going to go right into the show.

57
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:07,100
Yeah, you had a twenty minute opening break before the show, so deal.

58
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:12,500
So, hello, and welcome to Orange Lounge Radio episode number 61.

59
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:14,300
We're going to get right into it.

60
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:20,540
If you want to join our chat room, www.calibomani.com, click on Orange Lounge and click on chat.

61
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:23,580
If we're a little dazed, you'll just have to forgive us, it's taking us a minute to

62
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:26,460
kind of get back in the groove here, trying to do the show.

63
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:29,020
Hey, get in the groove, I made a DDR game.

64
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:30,020
No.

65
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:31,020
Do you want to...

66
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:32,020
Ow!

67
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:33,020
Okay.

68
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:35,020
Get out the whip, babe.

69
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:40,020
All right, if you want to visit our webcam,

70
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:42,260
because we have a lot of guests in the studio tonight,

71
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:43,780
go to our chat room and they'll tell you

72
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:44,980
how to get to the webcam, because we're not

73
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:45,980
giving out the URL here.

74
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:47,940
Because that's incentive to go to the chat.

75
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:50,620
OK, let's go around and say who's here tonight,

76
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:52,260
because we have a lot of guests here.

77
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:54,660
So you know Dark, Sackler, and Loki, of course, by now.

78
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:55,460
We also have.

79
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:56,260
Say hello.

80
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:58,860
It's Puppy over here.

81
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:00,860
Cat Puppy is in the house.

82
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:02,020
Yes, after.

83
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:04,340
Be careful with that.

84
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:09,060
you break something also with us tonight say hello to this is somebody who's new

85
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:14,940
never been to the show say hello to pilot hyper girl hello how are you she

86
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:19,300
brought her whip and everything so she's going to oh hello not in the house not

87
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:28,100
in the house dear unless it's in the bedroom well you're 18 now huh when's

88
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:31,300
your first movie coming out I'm just kidding it's not gonna happen with me

89
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:45,340
We went with Randy, Yellow Jacket Boy, also known as DJ Taka on the boards, or Taka Shonen

90
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:48,100
as you guys might know him on Cali Bumani.

91
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:57,500
We also went with Aori, we went with BJ, and we went with Psycho Joe.

92
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:00,540
Apparently clubbing is a place where everyone is either drunk or high.

93
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:03,540
No, when I go. Well, drunk maybe.

94
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:04,540
Incredibly high.

95
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:08,540
I get drunk a lot. I don't get high. I don't do that. I don't endorse Swede.

96
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:12,540
Now, drunk on the other hand is a different story.

97
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:15,540
Yeah, drunk on the other hand is a completely different story.

98
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:19,540
Okay, I'm noticing we're still having some connection stability issues.

99
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:23,540
Like, our chat room is running fine, but the station seems to be having...

100
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:24,540
Still, we don't have issues.

101
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:27,540
Having a problem. Yeah, what is this show if we don't have issues?

102
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:31,540
We're just going to keep going here, and you'll have to bear with us.

103
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:35,540
You can address those cards and love letters to Comcast Cable, because that's where our

104
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:36,540
problem lies right now.

105
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:42,540
If you guys haven't heard already, because I heard this hit National News, California,

106
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:47,540
Oregon, and Washington all had an outage on Comcast, so we all went down for about ten

107
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:50,540
minutes, but for some reason, some areas went down for an hour, and we were one of those

108
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:51,540
lucky areas.

109
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:53,540
So anyway, bear with us.

110
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:58,300
those lucky areas. So anyway, bear with us. The show will be played back in its entirety

111
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:03,540
on Wednesday and Thursday, of course. The webcam is also being switched over to a one

112
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:09,180
minute refresh because of the traffic on the net right now because of this Comcast outage.

113
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:15,500
So I'm switching it over to one minute refresh. I think the buffer, introduce yourself one

114
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:19,500
more time, dear, because I think the buffer hit right when you were introducing yourself.

115
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:23,500
Hello! It's VHG. Yeah, okay.

116
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:25,000
Hi!

117
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:25,500
Alright.

118
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:27,500
I was sitting here going, I'm a burp.

119
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:31,500
Do you need to let out a burp, Jamie? Just let it out. Let it out, girl.

120
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:34,500
I'm going to exorcise the burp.

121
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:38,500
My burp is stuck in my esophagus.

122
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:41,500
Yeah, pat her on the back like a baby.

123
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:44,500
There it is! It worked!

124
00:06:44,500 --> 00:07:13,220
You're like a gassy baby right now.

125
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:23,220
I knew you were full of hot gas, but- I cannot put that in my hair.

126
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:24,220
Aha.

127
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:25,220
Oh.

128
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:26,220
No.

129
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:28,460
B.H.G. do not give her the whip.

130
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:29,460
That's bad.

131
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:31,180
She doesn't need the whip.

132
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:32,700
We still have more people to introduce.

133
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:36,580
We have a guy here from halfway across America we haven't even said hello to yet, so let's

134
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:37,580
get over here.

135
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:40,380
Well, let's go around the couch here.

136
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:41,380
Say hello.

137
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:42,380
Hello.

138
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:43,380
Hello.

139
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:44,380
Hi Joey, how are you?

140
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:45,380
I'm good, thank you.

141
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:46,380
You're back!

142
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:47,380
I'm back.

143
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:50,140
Joey played his very first game of DDR today.

144
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:51,140
I did.

145
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:55,140
This is exciting that one year into Orange Lounge Radio we can still find DDR noobs and

146
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:57,540
kind of like follow them along as they're getting into DDR.

147
00:07:57,540 --> 00:07:58,540
It's so cute.

148
00:07:58,540 --> 00:07:59,540
Oh, that was the ferret launcher.

149
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:00,540
Dude, Matt built a ferret launcher.

150
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:01,540
That's awesome.

151
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:02,540
You missed it.

152
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:03,540
Oh, he booked you?

153
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:04,540
It wasn't that good anyway.

154
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:05,540
You missed it.

155
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:06,540
Oh, you broke the...

156
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:07,540
It wasn't that good anyway.

157
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:08,540
The burp of all burps.

158
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:09,540
Ferret, ferret.

159
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:10,540
I need the ferret.

160
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:11,540
Okay.

161
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:12,540
I need one.

162
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:13,540
Let's see who else is here.

163
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:14,540
There he is.

164
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:15,540
Yeah, baby.

165
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:16,540
Pass it on.

166
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:17,540
And here we go.

167
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:18,540
All the way from Kansas is Shane.

168
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:19,540
Hi, Shane.

169
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:20,540
Hi, Rob.

170
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:21,540
How are you?

171
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:22,540
I'm fine.

172
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:23,540
I'm fine.

173
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:24,540
I'm fine.

174
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:25,540
I'm fine.

175
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:26,540
I'm fine.

176
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:27,540
I'm fine.

177
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:28,540
I'm fine.

178
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:29,540
I'm fine.

179
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:30,540
I'm fine.

180
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:31,540
I'm fine.

181
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:32,540
I'm fine.

182
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:33,540
I'm fine.

183
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:34,980
Hi, how are you?

184
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:35,580
Good.

185
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:37,740
And what's your name online for people that might know you?

186
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:38,240
Shane.

187
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:41,420
Oh, nobody knows me online.

188
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:42,020
I know you.

189
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:42,820
I know you online.

190
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:45,860
Oh, then it'd be Zex and Shad.

191
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:47,940
Didn't you say you posted on some Kansas City boards

192
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:49,140
or something?

193
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:49,740
Yeah.

194
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:52,180
But you posted Shane?

195
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:53,500
No, I posted Mikletas.

196
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:54,660
Oh, OK.

197
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:56,380
Well, hello and welcome to California.

198
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:56,980
Thank you.

199
00:08:56,980 --> 00:08:58,740
What brings you to California this week?

200
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:01,260
Family business and to get away from school.

201
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:01,860
Right on.

202
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:02,620
Good deal.

203
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:06,540
And what do you think so far of California, we're a little crazy here, huh?

204
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:15,880
Just a little, the ferrets flying, and the burping.

205
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:19,820
And it's nice to find Dance Summit, like, people that like it.

206
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:22,320
Dance Summit was pretty cool, I've got to admit, that's what we were kind of filling

207
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,680
in our downtime with, so that was fun.

208
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:26,680
So a big hello to you, thank you for being here.

209
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:27,680
Thank you.

210
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:30,520
This is neat because just like, what, two weeks ago we had John Fields here all the

211
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:41,040
all the way from like way back east, Connecticut, New York, all the way from Connecticut and

212
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:47,440
now here we have another fan all the way from Kansas, so this is cool, I like this, and

213
00:09:47,440 --> 00:10:00,080
of course in the corner where the freshman belongs is, where's my fucking joke book Rob?

214
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:02,600
The problem with your joke book is it's only about two pages long.

215
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:03,600
I think I have it.

216
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,600
I'm just kidding.

217
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:08,640
Oh, he did not just go there.

218
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:09,640
No, no.

219
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:11,760
Rob, Rob, it's more than two pages long.

220
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:14,520
It's five pages long in 40-point font.

221
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:15,520
Ouch.

222
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:22,040
I knew there was a reason you always hear from witty commentary.

223
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:24,240
All right.

224
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:28,960
So, whew, okay, everybody calm down for a minute.

225
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:29,960
Whew.

226
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:35,440
chaos in the beginning of the show here. I thought we'd kick off the show like we usually

227
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:40,840
do, our all favorite game. How was your week and how was your day? I want to play this

228
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:44,000
because of course we have some out of town folks here that probably have a lot that I

229
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:49,000
want to say about California. And I certainly have a lot to say. So let's, I actually have

230
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:55,120
the money related stories to tell this week too. No way, way. So we're going to start

231
00:10:55,120 --> 00:11:07,120
with Jamie. Hi. Wait, wait, hold on, hold on. I got this. Bradley gets a total zing.

232
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:11,620
Arkadian42 in the chat room, he says, and 23 Magus's joke book, it's printed on recycled

233
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:24,820
paper just like the material. I hate you. That was beautiful. I thought that it was

234
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:31,620
recycled like, you know, like recycled toilet paper. It's written on five sheets of toilet

235
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:38,820
paper. Anyway, Jamie, how was your day? How was your week? My week sucked. I worked and

236
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:42,620
Dan was off in Texas.

237
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:46,180
He manages an unnamed video game store.

238
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:53,940
And this unnamed series of video game stores

239
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:59,340
had a conference in an unnamed state named Texas.

240
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:00,300
It's named now.

241
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:02,260
You killed the ferret!

242
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:03,260
Ferret rescued you.

243
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:04,740
I killed the ferret.

244
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:06,140
The ferret's supposed to be.

245
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:07,420
OK.

246
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:08,620
Give me the ferret.

247
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:10,620
give me my baby

248
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:12,620
I don't want this baby

249
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:14,620
I don't want it now

250
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:16,620
ok anyway

251
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:18,620
anyway

252
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:20,620
so I've been really

253
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:22,620
like by myself all week

254
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:24,620
and it sucked

255
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:26,620
and I played some

256
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:28,620
play some fantasy star

257
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:30,620
I played some

258
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:32,620
yeah my new

259
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:34,620
addiction sort of is fantasy star online

260
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:41,620
online. Which I'm playing on the Xbox. Because I gave up playing it on the GameCube.

261
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:46,620
In response to Naoki in the chat room, yes, you must get the Skaia. Yes, you will. And

262
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:53,620
it's... Oh, Jamie... Okay, what are we looking at inside? What are we looking at inside?

263
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:58,620
I don't think I wonder what's in that jug. They're growing a mutant in this bottle of

264
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:02,620
orange juice

265
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:07,620
it expired in july and i got it in the fridge today

266
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:08,620
yuck

267
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:14,620
might i add i was about to pour myself a glass

268
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:18,620
but penicillin is good for you, it's an anti-biotic

269
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:19,620
yeah right

270
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:21,620
it's rare form

271
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:24,620
let me shift my position here

272
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:26,620
i'm still hiding from the webcam

273
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:28,900
Anyway, what is that?

274
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:34,120
Anyway, all right.

275
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:36,660
Richie, they do not look like maids.

276
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,800
Get over it, please.

277
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:46,900
Anyway, the Capra's look stupid now, by the way.

278
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:51,880
But anyway, so I played like a whole bunch of Red Rock online

279
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:54,000
and they implemented the Komodo patch,

280
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,460
which I made it there walking with my assassin.

281
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:03,720
Anyway, with the, you know,

282
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:05,580
judicious use of fly wings to teleport.

283
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:11,860
And I, and then I found out that with all the free wharfs it only cost me

284
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:16,640
like 2,000 zenny to get there with my, to get there with my merchant.

285
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:23,340
So I took my merchant there, bought 60,000 steel arrows and doubled all of my money, like,

286
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:26,080
and then I started a guild named Battle Royale

287
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:28,160
on my archer

288
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:32,200
anyway, so yeah, my week's been like full of gaming and then full of some

289
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,800
really stupid crappy stress

290
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:37,440
and I haven't touched a single bimani game all weekend

291
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,920
all week

292
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:45,200
you know what, the past four weeks we've done this segment you haven't touched a bimani game

293
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:50,200
I am next week. Max 2 is coming out this week, do you plan on playing it? I'm gonna play it

294
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:56,000
I've still got the interestingly acquired

295
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,920
dance pad at my house.

296
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:01,520
You mean my dance pad?

297
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:02,920
It's been at my house for 30 days.

298
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:04,280
Hey, watch it, lady.

299
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:06,920
I don't like where you're going with that.

300
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:07,920
I'm kidding.

301
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:11,000
It's not paying rent either, so evict it already.

302
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:11,920
I'm kidding.

303
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:14,280
You know I give it back when you ask for it.

304
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:18,360
Provided we don't break up, because that's

305
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:25,320
I got it in the first place and and then I found out that I'm 69% male on my

306
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:43,920
lateral which is funny excuse me but I have balls to scratch thank you for

307
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,540
of those in your magazine said, I thought

308
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:47,740
they were on the upper body.

309
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:48,640
Flying ferret.

310
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:54,980
This thing hurts, by the way, when you hit people with it.

311
00:15:54,980 --> 00:16:00,500
My, my, I found out that this thing

312
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:03,780
that I have my hair wrapped up in hurts really hard

313
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:05,440
if you get wrapped with it.

314
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,920
What about the whip?

315
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:08,440
Whips hurt too, but this hurts more.

316
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:09,940
Oh, OK.

317
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:27,860
Anyway, I downloaded a bunch of crap from my computer, and she's also the most wonderful

318
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:33,860
sister in the world because she's working on dark sakura.com and by the way we did some

319
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:41,660
work for roleplay.dark sakura.com which should be a few more forms have been added on so

320
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:49,060
everybody has to sign up for it now and then that's it so that was your day in your week

321
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:56,020
and came home today and you might be leaving early tonight maybe because it might you might

322
00:16:56,020 --> 00:17:01,180
have to you know plan for a long evening home tonight and we're gonna go get food

323
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:07,100
but I ate I had a salad and blue potato chips which I'm going to share with

324
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:12,060
everyone yum blue did it taste like blue it tastes like blue amazingly enough

325
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:21,100
awesome it tastes very rugged like blue just a reminder you guys I'm the chat

326
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:24,820
room is kind of bitching about things going up and down we're doing the best

327
00:17:24,820 --> 00:17:29,660
we can address those cards and letters to Comcast, DDRcaholic in the chat room says

328
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:33,540
Comcast is so friggin' unreliable, it should be illegal to run a business the way they

329
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:36,740
do and I tend to agree, it's pretty sad.

330
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:38,540
It's even worse than Scandia's business.

331
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:42,380
It's worse than Roseville Golf Land.

332
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:43,380
And getting down to Scandia's.

333
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:47,020
It's a moment of silence like, I can't believe you just went there.

334
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:52,420
Hey, I worked at Arcades, I know what's going on.

335
00:17:52,420 --> 00:18:13,260
How was your week, how was your day?

336
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:17,220
This week was expensive, it involved buying things.

337
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:22,220
There's a lot of wood outside.

338
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:26,220
Loki bought some stiff wood.

339
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:32,220
Yes, I bought eight nice sheets of MDF for the arcade cabinet.

340
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:35,220
I'm working on finishing my pads. I'm almost done.

341
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:38,220
I've got one of them almost done.

342
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:45,220
I'm starting the wiring on it, but I haven't gotten around to it.

343
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:47,580
But anyway, starting the wiring on one of the pads,

344
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:51,420
the other pad needs to be done, probably be done this week.

345
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:55,780
Arcade stuff, I'm getting the rest of my buttons pretty soon.

346
00:18:55,780 --> 00:18:58,220
I ordered an Atari 2600 track ball

347
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:01,780
that's going to be hacked into turntables for 2DX.

348
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:04,100
So you're turning an Atari 2600 track ball

349
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:05,660
into a 2DX controller?

350
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:08,260
No, the optical controls for it are

351
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:12,020
going to be for the turntables for 2DX.

352
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:17,420
But then, I have these two spinners here, I realize they're pretty useless now.

353
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:21,840
Yeah. Because I can't use them, duh.

354
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:25,420
It's because it's a B movie.

355
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:32,180
But anyways, so I bought a bunch of shit, and I spent a lot of money,

356
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:34,620
and now I have to scrimp for like a few weeks.

357
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:37,300
And then, what else did I do?

358
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:48,180
I can't even see the screen. It's for the best, Loki, don't worry about it. It's for

359
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:54,220
the best. Our chat room, our chat room is bitchy tonight. Man, you take, you rob them

360
00:19:54,220 --> 00:20:01,060
of 20 minutes of orange lounge and just go freaking claws out. I think Loki's kicking

361
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:08,060
someone from the chat room. And of course she's under my name. Hey, be nice! That was

362
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:17,820
under me! You did that under my name! Rob, that's so mean! Why did you do that? I didn't

363
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:24,820
do it, and Jamie knows it, and she's my witness. I did not do it! I didn't do it! Rob! I said

364
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:38,620
I'm sorry I'm gonna kick him where's my foot that's pretty bad if you smell the

365
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:44,380
shoe mine smells worse okay so what else did I do this week

366
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:47,780
Will somebody, will somebody invite her back, please?

367
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:51,180
Anyway, go ahead.

368
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:56,220
Yeah. So, what else?

369
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:58,340
I don't know, I didn't do too much this week.

370
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:01,180
It's pretty much just working on the stupid pads and then, you know,

371
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:03,440
just sitting at my desk, rotting away.

372
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:08,360
And at one point I was trying to, I didn't know how I was going to hook up the pads to, like, the.

373
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:27,440
I know I'm hilarious okay if you're not in our chat room tonight you're missing

374
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:34,240
out I'm sorry I'm sorry that was so one-sided the chat room is so bitchy

375
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:41,880
she tonight, it's beautiful. You must be there. www.callybemani.com. Click on Orange

376
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:58,040
Lounge and click on chat. Yeah, anyways, so... Moving on. Yes. Yeah, that's pretty much my

377
00:21:58,040 --> 00:22:06,080
week yeah just a lot of nothing oh and I found a lot of rotted stuff in our

378
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:16,960
fridge which I cleaned out not that huh yeah hmm that's it I'm done all right

379
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:22,560
but then again you know if Marin wants me to I can keep talking all night long I can

380
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:31,480
never said. I'll talk about my week and my day. My week was, there wasn't really a lot

381
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:37,080
to it, work, sleep, play, you know, type thing, whatever. There was that and then, but this

382
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:44,200
weekend, this was cool. Yesterday, yesterday I went to Reno. Well, Reno is kind of a shit

383
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:50,320
hole in some ways but, you know, I got to gamble which is fun because I love gambling.

384
00:22:50,320 --> 00:23:07,720
I lost $100 yesterday gambling, which is kind of sad in a way, but I had lost $120, and

385
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:13,240
I made $20 back on video poker, so that's good, but I lost $60 in a slot machine trying

386
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:15,240
to win a Lexus.

387
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:17,040
I really, really wanted it.

388
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:19,360
That was real wise.

389
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:22,840
And not only do we gamble, we went around and played some different DDR machines, because

390
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:27,000
you know, in a town like Vegas or Reno, every casino's got a DDR machine, right?

391
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:31,560
So we went to the El Dorado, and they have, get this, a Solo 4th Plus.

392
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:33,920
Those are so rare.

393
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:34,920
It was godly.

394
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:36,520
I was so happy to play it.

395
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:42,920
I mean, like, how often do you see a 4th Plus these days, let alone a Solo 4th Plus I could

396
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:43,920
play?

397
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:48,880
And you know, you know, I fired that fucker up and I played Solo Conga Feelin', first

398
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:52,880
6 panel conga feelin. It's awesome.

399
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:56,880
And I did some freestyle too. That was fun. I went with the Ice Princess.

400
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:00,880
I did some lead freestyle too.

401
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:04,880
Aaron too just perked up when you said that.

402
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:08,880
I did some great freestyle. I did a freestyle to the 7th jump.

403
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:12,880
I did a freestyle to the 7th jump. It ruled.

404
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:16,880
You don't know the 7th.

405
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:51,880
I feel the need to spread my sky germs everywhere.

406
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:52,880
Oh, heaven forbid.

407
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:53,880
So, anyway.

408
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:54,880
I humped that machine.

409
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:57,880
That was pretty much my week of my day in a nutshell.

410
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:59,880
Yeah, I am.

411
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:02,880
So, if EvilMalkey2DX says he humped that machine.

412
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:03,880
So, I humped it too.

413
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:05,880
So, we kind of had sex.

414
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:10,880
I hope you wore a condom.

415
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,880
Oh, boy.

416
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:15,600
I did, I danced to Oh Nick, please don't so quick too,

417
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:20,380
because to play six panel erotic is just beautiful.

418
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:23,740
Moving on.

419
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,360
What was that number two in your five toilet paper sheet joke book?

420
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:31,800
Puppy. How was your day, how was your week?

421
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:39,780
Okay, this week has been stuff on campus, looking for a job, and just got,

422
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:43,780
kostjamrh And more Disgaea, and more Disgaea, and more Disgaea.

423
00:25:43,780 --> 00:25:46,780
Q. Did you do the past week's prize Disgaea?

424
00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:50,780
A. No, I really don't remember anything I did the past week besides play Disgaea.

425
00:25:50,780 --> 00:25:55,780
That's kinda sad, but it's time well spent.

426
00:25:55,780 --> 00:25:57,780
Q. You took a picture of my ass in the screenshot.

427
00:25:57,780 --> 00:26:00,780
A. That's a really good picture.

428
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:05,780
And then there's that fuck out column on the microphone.

429
00:26:05,780 --> 00:26:14,780
A game has to be good when you hear some really disturbing jokes about a zombie and a horse

430
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:15,780
wiener.

431
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:21,140
Is this something out of Magus's joke book?

432
00:26:21,140 --> 00:26:22,140
What?

433
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:23,140
No.

434
00:26:23,140 --> 00:26:24,140
Oh.

435
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:25,140
No, I'm serious.

436
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:26,140
It's actually part of the plot of the game.

437
00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:28,660
Why is my ass still on the webcam?

438
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:31,580
Your ass is still on the webcam because it hasn't refreshed you.

439
00:26:31,580 --> 00:26:38,580
checking you out

440
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:40,860

456
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:38,620
p0k3smot42o my week was filled with work, and work, and more work, but it pays the bills.

457
00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:47,500
This weekend I was off, didn't do a whole lot, just hung out, and today I played my

458
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:58,420
first game of DDR, very first time, and what was it? I passed a three-step.

459
00:27:58,420 --> 00:28:02,940
Yes, you passed a three-footer. That's the DDR lingo, a three-footer.

460
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:08,900
I passed it. That was so cool. First try. Anyway, other than that, that was it.

461
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:15,900
it

462
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:19,820
uh... was it

463
00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:23,220

464
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:25,840
Good job!

465
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:32,840
Chaos, this isn't Channel DDR Freak, mom jokes are not welcome here!

466
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:41,840
Anyway, our chair room is so feisty tonight. What a bunch of bitches.

467
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:51,840
Anyway, let's move on. Andrew, Mr. Magus, tell us about your week and your day.

468
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:59,840
My week was full of bombing Japanese quizzes and putting it on locks at the ARC arcade.

469
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:19,400
I've been studying, Jamie, and I've been working with a student association at ARC, trying

470
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:21,280
to get some machines worked on.

471
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:25,660
They're checking out the Beachhead 2000, trying to get there a place for something Bahmani.

472
00:29:55,660 --> 00:30:01,740
I can concur with that, actually.

473
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:05,740
And now, if you noticed, I saved our two guests for last, and one's on the phone right now.

474
00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:09,380
He must be on a booty call, so we'll talk to Aaron.

475
00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:12,660
Never mind, this is Dad.

476
00:30:12,660 --> 00:30:20,420
What was that joke he told at dinner, something about we were making fun of him for being

477
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:23,820
on the phone with his uncle, or something, we joked about it being a booty call, and

478
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:27,740
He said, no, it's my uncle, and he's not even cute.

479
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:30,260
It's great.

480
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:30,940
Shane's a riot.

481
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:32,480
We'll hear from him in a little bit.

482
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:34,700
Let's hear from Erin, Biden hyper girl.

483
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:37,180
How was your week and how was your day?

484
00:30:37,180 --> 00:30:40,940
Well, my week was full of planning for a friend,

485
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:43,460
planning a birthday party for a friend, a surprise birthday

486
00:30:43,460 --> 00:30:45,820
party, which, by the way, when we surprised her,

487
00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:49,220
I've never seen her turn more red until that day.

488
00:30:49,220 --> 00:30:50,460
And she started crying, too.

489
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:53,620
So it was a really good party, and I slept over.

490
00:30:53,620 --> 00:30:59,660
So I am running on about three hours of sleep, a sip of DNL,

491
00:30:59,660 --> 00:31:02,660
some water, some orange juice, huh?

492
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:03,740
Don't forget the penguin mints.

493
00:31:03,740 --> 00:31:04,940
Yeah, the penguin mints.

494
00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:08,180
And I don't know what else I'm running on.

495
00:31:08,180 --> 00:31:11,060
Hi, and welcome to college.

496
00:31:11,060 --> 00:31:13,300
Yeah, I feel vaguely hungry right now,

497
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:14,420
but it hasn't hit me yet.

498
00:31:14,420 --> 00:31:15,300
I'm hungry.

499
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:16,340
Give me the blue cheese.

500
00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:17,460
Let's get the blue cheese.

501
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:17,960
No!

502
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:21,540
But yeah.

503
00:31:21,540 --> 00:31:27,020
and um... by the way my apartment has two vents

504
00:31:27,020 --> 00:31:30,020
for those of you that don't know

505
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:33,740

506
00:31:33,740 --> 00:31:36,260

507
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:41,400
my apartment has two vents none of which are in any of the bedrooms

508
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:43,460
my toilet leaks

509
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:44,760

510
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:46,580
water stain

511
00:31:46,580 --> 00:31:49,740
there's a water stain on my ceiling

512
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:53,800
we have no internet we won't have any internet for the next two days

513
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:56,600
and yay no internet

514
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:57,500
we don't

515
00:31:57,500 --> 00:31:59,720
i don't think we have comcast

516
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:03,500
you're getting dsl right that's not comcast

517
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:06,640
yeah i don't think it's comcast it's blue they're passing around blue chips

518
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:10,640
so shot shane's like

519
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:14,480
you want me to talk to him?

520
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:17,560
so he wants to finish his chip i'll give him a second

521
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:22,480
So, and now my weekend will be winding down with spending time with this crazy, insane,

522
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:27,500
perverted Orange Lounge crew, which I love so very, very much.

523
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:30,740
And yes, it is true, I do have my whip.

524
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:35,120
So there will be a lot of mass bondage orgy tonight.

525
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:36,120
What?

526
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:40,980
I heard orgy.

527
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:41,980
Oh, crap.

528
00:32:41,980 --> 00:32:42,980
Here.

529
00:32:42,980 --> 00:32:43,980
All right.

530
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:45,980
Not just any orgy, Logie.

531
00:32:45,980 --> 00:32:46,980
Ass bondage.

532
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:47,980
That's a mass.

533
00:32:47,980 --> 00:32:48,980
Orgy.

534
00:32:48,980 --> 00:32:49,980
Oh, mass?

535
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:51,740
Oh, I thought she said ass bondage.

536
00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:52,740
Mass bonded orgy.

537
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:53,980
I was like, is that like leather panties?

538
00:32:53,980 --> 00:32:55,980
Hey, that's going to make fun.

539
00:32:55,980 --> 00:32:56,980
Except for the ass part.

540
00:32:56,980 --> 00:33:00,980
Ass bondage is super glue.

541
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:03,180
Right.

542
00:33:03,180 --> 00:33:05,140
Mass orgy sounds great.

543
00:33:05,140 --> 00:33:06,140
I'm down.

544
00:33:06,140 --> 00:33:07,140
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

545
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:09,900
This is a side of Logie I've never seen before.

546
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:20,940
orgy I've never seen him just propose a mass orgy like this sorry anyway let's

547
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:23,940
talk to Shane I'm not sure you was proposing I think he was just agreeing

548
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:29,180
with it I went in order of distance here so Shane has to be last I'm just kidding

549
00:33:29,180 --> 00:33:36,540
so how you doing I'm good my week sucked because we drove a hundred or one

550
00:33:36,540 --> 00:33:39,380
One thousand six hundred and ninety miles from Kansas to get here.

551
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:40,380
You counted.

552
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:41,380
No.

553
00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:42,380
Yeah.

554
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:49,140
Well, you don't have much else to do on the road.

555
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:50,140
You had to drive through Nevada.

556
00:33:50,140 --> 00:33:51,140
Yeah.

557
00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:54,100
Oh, and I have a serious F.U. to Elko later.

558
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:55,100
Oh my God.

559
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:56,100
Okay.

560
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:57,100
But, yeah.

561
00:33:57,100 --> 00:34:02,360
Two days of driving, eh, family, eh, Scandia.

562
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:03,360
Had 2DX.

563
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:04,360
That was pretty good.

564
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:07,880
um... got a double A on Dancer, yay!

565
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:10,480
uh... died on Yoru no Sunglass, ooh again

566
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:11,860
errrrrrrr

567
00:34:11,860 --> 00:34:13,980
and uh... yeah

568
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:16,460
just relaxing, taking time off school

569
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:18,900
any other interesting things you've seen in Sacramento while you've been here?

570
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:20,580
um...

571
00:34:20,580 --> 00:34:22,340
let's see

572
00:34:22,340 --> 00:34:27,280
no, no, really, it's been pretty good. Oh, I know, what did you have for the first time today? Oh, Mongolian Barbecue

573
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:29,580
that was awesome

574
00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:35,020
I burnt my tongue and it still hurts, but it was good.

575
00:34:35,020 --> 00:34:39,380
We took them to one of the Mongolians that isn't even like one of the really good ones

576
00:34:39,380 --> 00:34:40,380
we always go to.

577
00:34:40,380 --> 00:34:42,640
We took them to that one we used to go to by my old house.

578
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:45,340
It's just called the Mongolian barbecue behind Wasabi.

579
00:34:45,340 --> 00:34:48,740
It's okay, but it's not even the best one.

580
00:34:48,740 --> 00:34:55,980
Well, you can't have Mongolian barbecue now, they're all closed.

581
00:34:55,980 --> 00:35:04,340
I never had Korean barbeque.

582
00:35:04,340 --> 00:35:07,100
So what else are you going to do on your trip?

583
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:10,380
I just got my San Francisco trip cancelled, which is fine.

584
00:35:10,380 --> 00:35:11,380
What?

585
00:35:11,380 --> 00:35:16,340
Dad doesn't want to drive anymore, so that's okay.

586
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:18,340
You get to hang with us more!

587
00:35:18,340 --> 00:35:19,340
Oh no.

588
00:35:19,340 --> 00:35:24,340
You can come over for vanilla sky tomorrow night.

589
00:35:24,340 --> 00:35:25,340
My spinoff show.

590
00:35:25,340 --> 00:35:27,340
I'm so glad you asked, Erin!

591
00:35:28,340 --> 00:35:34,340
Vanilla Sky airs on Orange Lounge Radio every Monday night at 7 o'clock, provided we have a fucking internet connection tomorrow.

592
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:36,340
And on Tuesday nights...

593
00:35:37,340 --> 00:35:38,340
Come on, gimme!

594
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:40,340
God damn it, I'm eating my chips.

595
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:44,340
Tuesday night is pump up the volume.

596
00:35:44,340 --> 00:35:46,340
With me.

597
00:35:46,340 --> 00:35:48,340
Please show it at 7 o'clock, show it at 7.30.

598
00:35:48,340 --> 00:35:50,340
To 10.30.

599
00:35:50,340 --> 00:35:52,340
No, you can't have any more of my chips.

600
00:35:53,340 --> 00:35:54,340
Oh.

601
00:35:54,340 --> 00:36:06,260
there's something stuck in here oh no there's something um anyway um but it's

602
00:36:06,260 --> 00:36:11,020
a just an hour and a half I'm sorry three hours of lots of crap that I

603
00:36:11,020 --> 00:36:14,460
decided to play but in a chat room you can request something and if I have it

604
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:19,420
I'll play it and if it sucks I'll laugh at you and then I talk about killing

605
00:36:19,420 --> 00:36:34,100
people often okay oh hi there's a mic right here um what do I talk about my

606
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:37,780
show um first of all Rob I don't have much of a reason to because my internet

607
00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:43,260
was only out for five minutes and I wasn't even there when it happened the

608
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:46,780
only thing that obsessed me about that is I was vending at the time and you're

609
00:36:46,780 --> 00:36:53,180
Yeah, so now your your vending is gone and your pre-show got pretty much axed unfortunately, but now you don't have to do

610
00:36:54,940 --> 00:36:56,940
I

611
00:36:57,620 --> 00:37:01,580
Was gonna say oh my show Aaron asked what I talked about on my show I talked about

612
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:08,900
We talked about like news stories sometimes and then we sometimes get into like other games like we talked about puzzle pirates a little bit

613
00:37:08,980 --> 00:37:12,120
Talk about Ragnarok we talked about console games. I

614
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:14,100
saw

615
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:16,700
So now you even have more reason to join dark secularist forums

616
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:19,220
and

617
00:37:19,220 --> 00:37:26,560
Just general crap. We have a little bit. So we do every week. We do a video video game trivia to bad music and we do

618
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:29,840
Guess the yahoo talkback because people on Yahoo are idiots

619
00:37:31,260 --> 00:37:37,160
So tune in and see for yourself. Sorry. I just want to answer the question anything else you wanna say about your show Jamie on Tuesdays

620
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:48,160
I'm going to try to do video game music trivia, like actually where you play music and people guess, for an hour on my show.

621
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:53,160
So let's see if anyone can dethrone Darktitsia so that...

622
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:58,160
Huh? They can't hear what you're saying.

623
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:02,160
Can he do it in the last hour of the show so he can do it?

624
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:04,160
I'll see you when I'll start it. You just gotta be there.

625
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:04,660
Yeah.

626
00:38:04,660 --> 00:38:05,160
All right.

627
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:07,660
Next.

628
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:10,160
Hold on.

629
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:12,160
Actually, I was just going to say Wednesday night to go chronologically.

630
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:17,160
This Wednesday is going to be our DDR Max 2 show, and we're just going to...

631
00:38:17,660 --> 00:38:21,660
We're still not sure if Max 2 is actually going to hit Tuesday or Wednesday.

632
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:26,160
Some of you guys might get it Tuesday, but we're not going to bank on it, and Jamie has her show anyway,

633
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:28,660
so we're just going to hold off on Wednesday for sure.

634
00:38:28,660 --> 00:38:30,160
We will have Max 2.

635
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:34,120
unless we don't get it wednesday either well then we're going to burn down the place you

636
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:41,760
pre-ordered it from which is a game stop but it's not the game stop it's a game stop

637
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:49,340
so um so it's okay if we burn it um but uh wednesday we'll be playing max 2 live on air

638
00:38:49,340 --> 00:38:52,840
so for those of you that can't get it right now because of money issues or whatever you

639
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:56,360
can play it vicariously through us that's the whole idea and don't worry you'll lose

640
00:38:56,360 --> 00:39:00,580
interest just as fast as we will. Yes, and then you won't even want to buy it. But with

641
00:39:00,580 --> 00:39:04,000
DDR Max we actually did this and it was somewhat more successful than we thought. I just, I

642
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:07,700
remember when I got Max I went live with it. A lot of you really liked tuning in and listening

643
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:12,040
to it, so I had the webcam going and everything, so tune in for that this Wednesday. And then

644
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:17,020
next Wednesday, if it works out, what? Well, I was going to say that the first time we

645
00:39:17,020 --> 00:39:22,700
did that with Max, you kind of didn't have it very well set up. Yeah, it was kind of

646
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:24,860
a shitty set up, but it's going to be much, you can already tell it's going to be much

647
00:39:24,860 --> 00:39:33,660
much better this time because we have Loki's toys. Next Wednesday, it's not, the T's aren't

648
00:39:33,660 --> 00:39:37,660
crossed and the I's aren't dotted, but we're hoping that we're going to be teaming up with

649
00:39:37,660 --> 00:39:43,100
another website to bring you some exclusive programming. That's all I can say. Some very

650
00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:46,340
interesting debut programming next Wednesday, just a one-off show.

651
00:39:46,340 --> 00:39:48,060
I don't care about, but whatever.

652
00:39:48,060 --> 00:39:49,060
I go, whoo!

653
00:39:49,060 --> 00:39:54,340
Don't sound too excited. It's going to be big though. For a lot of you, you guys are

654
00:39:54,340 --> 00:40:02,340
going to be all woke. Yeah, you freaking losers. Anyway, Loki. I haven't been there like in

655
00:40:02,340 --> 00:40:07,460
a long time. Why are you giving this to me? Here. What are you doing? You freaking nut.

656
00:40:07,460 --> 00:40:16,740
I was supposed to talk about my show. My show is called Mass Bondage Orgy. It's every Thursday

657
00:40:16,740 --> 00:40:20,900
we have a mass bondage orgy in the middle of the room. We kind of move the table over

658
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:26,300
cuz it you know it's kind of in the way but I bet that pretty much explains the

659
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:34,540
stains on the ground but um yeah so mass bonded Georgie every Thursday at 7

660
00:40:34,540 --> 00:40:40,940
o'clock are you seriously changing the name I bet more people would tune in you

661
00:40:40,940 --> 00:40:46,660
know pretty funny Loki Loki's been having I feel bad because like people

662
00:40:46,660 --> 00:40:50,540
tune in to listen to my train wreck of a show and Jamie gets Jamie gets some

663
00:40:50,540 --> 00:40:54,060
pretty good listenership on her show, but for some reason you guys are not tuning in

664
00:40:54,060 --> 00:40:58,900
on Thursdays. Hey, guess what you guys? Friends sucks. Don't watch Friends. Listen to Loki's

665
00:40:58,900 --> 00:40:59,900
show.

666
00:40:59,900 --> 00:41:03,540
Well, if you know, the same amount of people keep tuning in constantly, I guess I'm going

667
00:41:03,540 --> 00:41:10,460
to have to stop doing my show and take a day off, you know?

668
00:41:10,460 --> 00:41:11,460
What?

669
00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:12,460
What?

670
00:41:12,460 --> 00:41:13,460
Do we need to borrow a TV? We have an extra.

671
00:41:13,460 --> 00:41:18,860
We'll see what we can do. We'll see what we can do.

672
00:41:18,860 --> 00:41:23,860
I'm going to sell mine for cheap.

673
00:41:23,860 --> 00:41:27,380
I have a nice 19-inch TV, pretty much like new.

674
00:41:27,380 --> 00:41:28,860
I just upgraded to a 25.

675
00:41:28,860 --> 00:41:30,780
Anyway, this is why no one tunes in Loki.

676
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:33,260
Talk about Livewire.

677
00:41:33,260 --> 00:41:34,980
Livewire, it's my mixing show.

678
00:41:34,980 --> 00:41:37,580
It's been going on for like seven weeks now except for one

679
00:41:37,580 --> 00:41:39,820
week where I didn't do it because it was my birthday.

680
00:41:39,820 --> 00:41:43,380
And then, yeah, so we did last week was

681
00:41:43,380 --> 00:41:44,860
Bamani remixed music.

682
00:41:44,860 --> 00:41:47,700
And we play a lot of like erotic trance stuff and then a

683
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:56,460
a lot of just remix stuff, like from 2DX and DDR and that kind of crap. And then, you know,

684
00:41:56,460 --> 00:42:00,980
you guys were, you know, treated to a very nice set, you know, all four of you that turned,

685
00:42:00,980 --> 00:42:06,380
tuned in. And actually, you know what, it was a good set of music. It was some good

686
00:42:06,380 --> 00:42:08,880
stuff. And you had some stuff in there we never heard before, like you had the long

687
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:15,380
version of that Drifting Away mix. That was cool. Yeah. Pretty much, yeah, my show I give

688
00:42:45,380 --> 00:42:48,140
it's a it's a sweet time

689
00:42:48,140 --> 00:42:49,860
yeah

690
00:42:49,860 --> 00:42:50,660
i know

691
00:42:50,660 --> 00:42:54,460
you have like a shot of flash version of gal panic

692
00:42:54,460 --> 00:42:56,420
that only is up during the show

693
00:42:56,420 --> 00:42:57,380
if you're tuned in

694
00:42:57,380 --> 00:42:58,220
well

695
00:42:58,220 --> 00:43:00,380
uh... no

696
00:43:00,380 --> 00:43:01,100
there you go

697
00:43:01,100 --> 00:43:04,980
marin says the best damn remix show ever

698
00:43:04,980 --> 00:43:05,860
i like

699
00:43:05,860 --> 00:43:10,680
it is the best damn life of money remixing show on my three sixty five we

700
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:12,680
We know this for a fact.

701
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:14,680
Yeah.

702
00:43:14,680 --> 00:43:16,680
Yes, all one of them.

703
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:18,680
Loser.

704
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:20,680
Friggin' A, yeah.

705
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:22,680
So, it's my show.

706
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:24,680
I try to have it prepared before, you know,

707
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:26,680
I go live.

708
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:28,680
Sometimes I do, sometimes I don't.

709
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:30,680
Like, this week I just kind of pulled it together

710
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:32,680
five minutes after the show started, so.

711
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:34,680
Is this the out of the act guy?

712
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:36,680
Yeah, they all are.

713
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:38,680
Now, if I'm not mistaking,

714
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:41,680
Don't we have a new Loki remix we're debuting tonight?

715
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:42,680
Yeah.

716
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:43,680
Ah!

717
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:49,520
We'll do that towards the end of the show because, um, because, yeah, speaking of pulled

718
00:43:49,520 --> 00:44:00,780
out the ass, yeah, that remix was, that remix was probably the second least, yeah, probably

719
00:44:00,780 --> 00:44:06,120
the second from the bottom for the least effort put into a remix, but it's pretty cool.

720
00:44:06,120 --> 00:44:09,120
I have banned that guy 5 times on VDR.

721
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:11,120
What? No stylings?

722
00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:13,120
JB Horne.

723
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:15,120
Are you done horning out Live Wire?

724
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:18,120
Yeah, speaking of whores, plenty of whores on Live Wire.

725
00:44:18,120 --> 00:44:22,120
Lots of whores and mass bondage.

726
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:25,120
In fact, we're just gonna play like pornos.

727
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:28,120
Hey, do you want me to loan you my whip?

728
00:44:28,120 --> 00:44:29,120
Nah, that's alright.

729
00:44:29,120 --> 00:44:30,120
Are you sure?

730
00:44:30,120 --> 00:44:33,120
He has his own collection in the closet.

731
00:44:33,120 --> 00:44:36,120
Just have handcuffs.

732
00:44:36,120 --> 00:44:39,120
And those are the lame handcuffs, too.

733
00:44:39,120 --> 00:44:40,120
Are they fuzzy handcuffs?

734
00:44:40,120 --> 00:44:48,120
No, they're plastic handcuffs I got with the Lupin kit.

735
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:49,120
No one missed it.

736
00:44:49,120 --> 00:44:51,120
I got it. This is great.

737
00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:55,120
Anyway, we kind of cut Shane off.

738
00:44:55,120 --> 00:45:00,120
I feel bad because Aaron gave us a chance to openly whore out our shows and we just jumped all over it.

739
00:45:00,120 --> 00:45:06,160
were like, screw the guy who came out here 1,700 miles.

740
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:07,800
I think that we just hopped on that one

741
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:10,440
and dry-humped that segment.

742
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:12,360
Plenty of dry-humping on Live Wire.

743
00:45:15,560 --> 00:45:18,040
We apologize for dry-humping your monologue.

744
00:45:18,040 --> 00:45:20,560
You may now continue.

745
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:23,480
OK, dry-humping the monologue, sex with my dad,

746
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:25,880
sex with my uncle, God.

747
00:45:25,880 --> 00:45:27,360
Although you can't decide.

748
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:34,360
I didn't really have anything else to say except for it's awesome here and I miss it

749
00:45:34,360 --> 00:45:41,360
I didn't really have anything else to say except for it's awesome here and I miss it

750
00:45:42,760 --> 00:45:47,760
a lot. Anybody else have anything to say, Rob?

751
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:54,600
Is somebody trying to ban No Styling? No, I'm copying his quote, so don't ban him. We

752
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:56,600
need comic books. I'm not banning him, you retort!

753
00:45:56,600 --> 00:46:01,600
Will somebody just... We need to keep our eyes on him. We're alive.

754
00:46:01,600 --> 00:46:30,840
We're going to do the FUs of the week right now.

755
00:46:30,840 --> 00:46:33,840
But then we're going to go like half the show out of breaks.

756
00:46:34,840 --> 00:46:36,840
Do you have to pee that bad?

757
00:46:36,840 --> 00:46:37,840
No.

758
00:46:37,840 --> 00:46:39,840
Okay, who has to pee in here?

759
00:46:39,840 --> 00:46:42,840
Okay, we're doing the fuckies of the week.

760
00:46:44,840 --> 00:46:45,840
It's a little warm.

761
00:46:45,840 --> 00:46:47,840
I went before we left.

762
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:48,840
Are we there yet?

763
00:46:48,840 --> 00:46:49,840
No.

764
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:50,840
Are we there yet?

765
00:46:50,840 --> 00:46:51,840
No.

766
00:46:51,840 --> 00:46:52,840
Are we there yet?

767
00:46:52,840 --> 00:46:53,840
No.

768
00:46:53,840 --> 00:46:54,840
Are we there yet?

769
00:46:54,840 --> 00:46:55,840
Shut up.

770
00:46:55,840 --> 00:46:56,840
Are we there yet?

771
00:46:56,840 --> 00:46:57,840
Bang!

772
00:46:57,840 --> 00:46:59,840
Oh wait, I lost the link for our forums.

773
00:46:59,840 --> 00:47:05,440
Where are our forums Rob? www.calibomani.com

774
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:08,440
Click on forums.

775
00:47:08,440 --> 00:47:13,440
In the corner, move the camera.

776
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:19,440
No, not on me.

777
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:21,440
Okay, let's...

778
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:25,440
So everybody, send Rob, flood Rob with private messages

779
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:27,440
with everything that pisses you off.

780
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:28,440
Alright, sounds good to me.

781
00:47:28,440 --> 00:47:30,440
And then ping him.

782
00:47:30,440 --> 00:47:34,440
God, our connection sucks enough thanks to Comcast.

783
00:47:34,440 --> 00:47:39,440
And then everyone, ping No Stylin.

784
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:40,440
At once.

785
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:41,440
Don't ping No Stylin.

786
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:46,440
I think 23rd Magus needs to move more to your right.

787
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:48,440
Move toward the box.

788
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:49,440
Hump the boxes.

789
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:51,440
Move the coin door.

790
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:52,440
Be gentle.

791
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:53,440
Gentle?

792
00:47:53,440 --> 00:48:04,600
By the way, for the record, diet vanilla Pepsi tastes like shit.

793
00:48:04,600 --> 00:48:09,360
Because aspartame is bad for you, and it turns to a chemical that's like formaldehyde when

794
00:48:09,360 --> 00:48:11,360
heated to body temperature.

795
00:48:11,360 --> 00:48:12,360
Really?

796
00:48:12,360 --> 00:48:21,320
That's why Propel is better for you.

797
00:48:21,320 --> 00:48:28,320
The V8 is made with Splenda, it's the regular, it's not diet splash.

798
00:48:31,260 --> 00:48:37,320
There's real V8 splash in the fridge. He'll go beat up a pineapple so you can have the

799
00:48:37,320 --> 00:48:43,320
juice of the pineapple. This is really good radio. Anyway, so Rob, where's my music?

800
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:50,320
Sorry, we're still having some buffering issues. Son of a bitch. I'm going to buffer a Comcast

801
00:48:50,320 --> 00:48:57,320
cast in about two seconds.

802
00:49:20,320 --> 00:49:27,320
Okay, there we go.

803
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:36,440
Okay, the first one of the week

804
00:49:36,440 --> 00:49:37,840
goes toward

805
00:49:37,840 --> 00:49:43,720
one of the moderators on a forum that I will play on, and I'm not going to say the forum yet,

806
00:49:43,720 --> 00:49:47,680
because I actually have no problem with everybody else, but this moderator

807
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:49,400
is abusing his power.

808
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:53,300
First of all, okay, this is funny, he accuses me of blaming.

809
00:49:53,300 --> 00:49:56,980
Accuses me of, you know, all this stuff.

810
00:49:56,980 --> 00:49:59,980
The first thing is, how many boards do I moderate on now?

811
00:49:59,980 --> 00:50:02,500
Five, six, seven boards?

812
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:04,620
An admin three?

813
00:50:04,620 --> 00:50:07,500
Okay, this has struck me, so I've reported

814
00:50:07,500 --> 00:50:11,940
into the side admin, shall we get it in here quickly?

815
00:50:11,940 --> 00:50:13,760
Unless, you know, he's, you know,

816
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:17,340
drug-humping the admin, then, I don't know.

817
00:50:17,340 --> 00:50:26,340
We'd probably have to be doing more than dry humping the admin to get away with that.

818
00:50:26,340 --> 00:50:32,340
You know, I would give the admin of this site more credit than to have such poor taste, so we'll go ahead.

819
00:50:32,340 --> 00:50:41,340
But, you know, if it turns out that there's no resolution to this soon, then I'm going to do some very public announcements

820
00:50:41,340 --> 00:50:48,340
and, uh, possibly, uh, report the, uh, site to the, uh, to their, uh, sponsors.

821
00:50:48,340 --> 00:50:56,340
Ooh. Because, you know what? There's, there's few things that I tolerate. Everyone knows

822
00:50:56,340 --> 00:51:01,340
me. If I have a problem with the service, even if it's free, oh, I will let them know.

823
00:51:01,340 --> 00:51:08,340
I will let them know. So, yes, I am a good moderator who hardly checks the board anymore.

824
00:51:08,340 --> 00:51:15,340
But no, um, that was really my only thing, and one goes, you know, I was really, I guess,

825
00:51:19,340 --> 00:51:26,340
nobody came to my house to get me people, so I was, so I was there, um, and then, and

826
00:51:26,340 --> 00:51:36,340
So I was there, um, and then really nothing else happened.

827
00:51:36,340 --> 00:51:39,340
Ugh! Alright. It's evil, Sandy.

828
00:51:39,340 --> 00:51:44,340
FINE! I just deleted it off the damn playlist, too.

829
00:51:44,340 --> 00:51:46,340
Rrrrrrrrr!

830
00:51:46,340 --> 00:51:51,340
You guys are never satisfied.

831
00:51:51,340 --> 00:52:00,340
kostjamrh Just keep it. Aaron says they won't be satisfied until you start doing sexual favors.

832
00:52:21,340 --> 00:52:32,340
F.E. to the fact that my stuff costs so much for this damn cabinet, why can't it be free? It's just wood. Trees are dead anyways.

833
00:52:32,340 --> 00:52:48,340
F.E. to the fact that Lowe's doesn't have the size brackets I need for my keyboard tray, so I couldn't get them after wandering hours through that store looking for keyboard tray bracket thingies.

834
00:52:48,340 --> 00:52:52,340
That sucks, but what else.

835
00:52:52,340 --> 00:53:06,340
Oh, I asked you for a cable going out because I was downloading Evil Bed 1-2, Army of Darkness, and Into the Woods, and that stopped about 77%.

836
00:53:06,340 --> 00:53:11,340
I asked you if the people at my work said you suck. You really annoy me.

837
00:53:11,340 --> 00:53:26,340
I have no choice. I can't go down. I have to go up.

838
00:53:41,340 --> 00:53:46,340
I'm just like counting the seconds.

839
00:53:46,340 --> 00:53:48,340
F.E. to NASA.

840
00:53:48,340 --> 00:53:52,340
You know, crashing something that costs 1.5 billion dollars is pretty stupid

841
00:53:52,340 --> 00:53:56,340
just because you didn't want to contaminate a moon on Jupiter

842
00:53:56,340 --> 00:54:00,340
with bacteria that might be on the satellite probe.

843
00:54:00,340 --> 00:54:03,340
Who gives a flying fuck what happens to the moons of Jupiter?

844
00:54:03,340 --> 00:54:07,340
They can fly away and smash into Neptune for all I care.

845
00:54:07,340 --> 00:54:09,340
It doesn't really matter.

846
00:54:09,340 --> 00:54:16,340
They financed that deal when they were trying to unify and automate all of the McDonalds.

847
00:54:39,340 --> 00:54:48,340
to where it, like, you know, registered everything that every store did, but of course that failed and the company lost a lot of money.

848
00:54:48,340 --> 00:54:54,340
Um, FQ2VRAA and MPAA, because you think that you know how to stop people from file sharing?

849
00:54:54,340 --> 00:55:02,340
You know, it's kind of funny because I do remember Napster, you know, and how nothing changed and it's only gotten worse.

850
00:55:02,340 --> 00:55:04,340
So what do you think is going to happen this time?

851
00:55:04,340 --> 00:55:10,340
This time you think it's going to magically solve itself, and oh, people are going to stop because they're getting sued.

852
00:55:10,340 --> 00:55:18,340
No, when you look at the statistics and you have 261 people out of millions of people downloading stuff, that's a pretty small statistic.

853
00:55:18,340 --> 00:55:24,340
Hell, getting struck by lightning, you have more chance than you know.

854
00:55:24,340 --> 00:55:28,340
F.E. to Hurricanes, because they're windy.

855
00:55:33,340 --> 00:55:39,340
Also, F.E. to the fact that I bought these spinners and I can't use them for anything.

856
00:55:40,340 --> 00:55:42,340
That sucks, and I cry.

857
00:55:43,340 --> 00:55:45,340
Those spinners are so nice.

858
00:55:46,340 --> 00:55:50,340
F.E. to people who don't like me talking, because I don't care what you think,

859
00:55:50,340 --> 00:55:52,340
and I'm going to keep talking over and over and over again,

860
00:55:52,340 --> 00:55:55,260
over again and we're going to keep rambling on and on and make the segment

861
00:55:55,260 --> 00:56:02,140
go longer than it really needs to will you talk during the mass bondage orgy oh

862
00:56:02,140 --> 00:56:09,140
yes I'm doing play-by-play for that mass bondage orgy and um f you for not being

863
00:56:09,140 --> 00:56:14,060
super duper rich so I can have an outing at a strip club

864
00:56:44,060 --> 00:56:50,060
Because I was going to buy about another six ferrets, but none of them freaking squeaked.

865
00:56:50,060 --> 00:56:52,060
That would have been hilarious.

866
00:56:52,060 --> 00:56:54,060
Darn. Big darn.

867
00:56:54,060 --> 00:56:56,060
Don't worry.

868
00:56:56,060 --> 00:56:58,060
But anyways.

869
00:56:58,060 --> 00:57:00,060
Chomp that music.

870
00:57:00,060 --> 00:57:02,060
My turn.

871
00:57:02,060 --> 00:57:14,480
My um, my FUs for this week start off with the one and only Comcast, I hate you, you

872
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:21,060
burn in hell, I hope you catch SARS, and I hope your dick falls off.

873
00:57:21,060 --> 00:57:22,060
You suck.

874
00:57:22,060 --> 00:57:26,280
We have like, our listeners are going through hell tonight trying to listen to this show

875
00:57:26,280 --> 00:57:29,360
because you guys are assifying our connection.

876
00:57:29,360 --> 00:57:40,360
I just made a new verb, acidifying our connection, and you suck, and, yeah.

877
00:57:40,360 --> 00:57:46,360
Well, Comcast may be a guy, but it drives like a woman.

878
00:57:46,360 --> 00:57:49,360
Just kidding, just kidding, just kidding.

879
00:57:49,360 --> 00:57:51,360
Just kidding, God.

880
00:57:51,360 --> 00:57:57,360
That joke was too easy, come on.

881
00:57:57,360 --> 00:58:04,360
That joke was way too easy, come on!

882
00:58:04,360 --> 00:58:05,360
Anyway...

883
00:58:05,360 --> 00:58:18,360
The feng shui of the highway!

884
00:58:18,360 --> 00:58:20,360
Aaron's ranting about old drivers.

885
00:58:20,360 --> 00:58:22,360
Well here, here's the mic.

886
00:58:22,360 --> 00:58:25,360
That's pretty much all I have to ask.

887
00:58:25,360 --> 00:58:28,360
You know what, I'm sure there's plenty of other things I could be mad at right now,

888
00:58:28,360 --> 00:58:30,360
but Comcast takes the fucking cake.

889
00:58:30,360 --> 00:58:34,360
F.U. is microphone quick because I swear to God it's trying to kill me.

890
00:58:36,360 --> 00:58:37,360
Yeah, you have to listen to him.

891
00:58:37,360 --> 00:58:39,360
Wait, no, that was last week.

892
00:58:41,360 --> 00:58:45,360
Alright, moving on, let's hear from our other guests.

893
00:58:45,360 --> 00:58:47,360
Let's start, I guess this Erin has a mic, we'll let her go.

894
00:58:47,360 --> 00:58:50,360
Erin, what do you want to say F.U. to this week?

895
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:53,640
First of all, another big F.U. to Comcast.

896
00:58:53,640 --> 00:58:56,480
I hope that you guys all rot in hell.

897
00:58:56,480 --> 00:58:58,440
And I will go after you all.

898
00:58:58,440 --> 00:59:00,320
I swear to God, you're worse than AOL.

899
00:59:00,320 --> 00:59:02,560
You all know how AOL is.

900
00:59:02,560 --> 00:59:05,680
Another big F.U. goes to the governor's race right now.

901
00:59:05,680 --> 00:59:08,000
I don't trust Bustamante.

902
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,240
Governor Gray Davis is an idiot, and Schwarzenegger

903
00:59:10,240 --> 00:59:12,520
doesn't know jack shit about politics.

904
00:59:12,520 --> 00:59:17,380
And unfortunately, that looks like the future of our state.

905
00:59:17,380 --> 00:59:18,980
Yeah, vote for the porn star, people!

906
00:59:20,980 --> 00:59:21,780
Oh, you're running.

907
00:59:25,080 --> 00:59:25,780
Jokes!

908
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:28,280
Jokes. No, we're fine, just keep going.

909
00:59:29,280 --> 00:59:34,080
The problem is, there's a problem between, somewhere between Comcast and Live 365 right now,

910
00:59:34,080 --> 00:59:36,380
so when we're trying to upload the show to Live 365,

911
00:59:36,880 --> 00:59:38,280
we're dropping out, massively.

912
00:59:38,280 --> 00:59:40,680
I mean, but we're still recording as a whole show.

913
00:59:40,680 --> 00:59:45,680
He said Dropout, and we're playing Dropout.

914
01:00:10,680 --> 01:00:13,140
who start drama over Initial D.

915
01:00:13,140 --> 01:00:14,520
Now,

916
01:00:14,520 --> 01:00:19,620
I've been around DDR3 growing enough to know, okay, it's huge, I know there's drama.

917
01:00:19,620 --> 01:00:23,220
And when there was drama in the Para community, I just said, fuck it, I'm leaving.

918
01:00:23,220 --> 01:00:29,220
Okay, but when you start drama in the Initial D community, what kind of idiots are you?

919
01:00:29,220 --> 01:00:30,140
Okay, just because

920
01:00:30,140 --> 01:00:34,240
some guy is going out with some girl doesn't mean you're going to start spreading rumors about him.

921
01:00:34,240 --> 01:00:38,900
It's not a high school anymore, get over it!

922
01:00:38,900 --> 01:00:47,900
This goes to the people who post on the Initial D thread on the board that I mod.

923
01:00:47,900 --> 01:00:51,900
You guys start Drama again, I will go after all of you.

924
01:00:51,900 --> 01:00:55,900
Initial D has its own thread? That's sad.

925
01:00:55,900 --> 01:00:57,900
He'll tell you.

926
01:00:57,900 --> 01:01:00,900
I'm starting the pole position thread on DDR Free.

927
01:01:00,900 --> 01:01:04,900
You're a loser. No one plays pole position anymore.

928
01:01:04,900 --> 01:01:07,900
I play pole position anymore. Screw you.

929
01:01:07,900 --> 01:01:20,900
That is my ultimatum to all who post on the initial d-thread. I am counting warnings right now, so don't piss me off. And I am nearing that time of the month, so don't piss me off.

930
01:01:20,900 --> 01:01:29,900
Because if you do, I will go fly. I know people who have large, large swords, and I know where you all live.

931
01:01:29,900 --> 01:01:34,900
p0k3smot42o is that a sexual innuendo there?

932
01:01:34,900 --> 01:01:41,900
I mean weapons, actual weapons, metal, sharp metal swords that will slice them all up.

933
01:01:44,900 --> 01:01:51,900
It's nice that the boards are quiet right now.

934
01:01:51,900 --> 01:01:58,900
Probably from a fellow moderator of those boards, it's kind of boring now when there's like three new posts a day.

935
01:01:58,900 --> 01:02:04,420
Well, it's actually kind of nice because you have people posting all the intelligent people true

936
01:02:04,900 --> 01:02:12,820
If you notice we have no we've had no easy end people. They've had no flame wars. You've had no drama. We're pocket

937
01:02:14,820 --> 01:02:18,180
Okay, tonight is giving away all right well

938
01:02:18,180 --> 01:02:20,180
Well, well.

939
01:02:20,180 --> 01:02:24,180
Actually now that you've blown our cover, there's no Oliver either, thank god.

940
01:02:29,180 --> 01:02:30,180
Nice!

941
01:02:30,180 --> 01:02:43,180
I'm done with my FUs other than the fact that a big FU goes to my apartment for the leaky toilet, the noisy fan, the lack of vents which will suffocate me one day and I'm going to kill my landlady, and the wobbly furniture.

942
01:02:44,180 --> 01:02:45,180
So yeah.

943
01:02:45,180 --> 01:02:47,180
umm what did you do to andrew?

944
01:03:15,180 --> 01:03:22,180
get

945
01:03:22,980 --> 01:03:29,980
out

946
01:03:30,320 --> 01:03:32,220
the jokes people don't

947
01:03:32,220 --> 01:03:35,900
so yes that's that's one of them uh...

948
01:03:35,900 --> 01:03:39,340
go to hell with your fifty seven dollars a month and

949
01:03:39,340 --> 01:03:41,140

950
01:03:41,140 --> 01:03:43,700
uh... my other if you would be

951
01:03:43,700 --> 01:03:50,420
to all the people in Nevada and Northern California that lock their keys in the car and leave

952
01:03:50,420 --> 01:03:59,500
their lights on because it makes my life a living hell. So, that'll be it. Um, let's

953
01:03:59,500 --> 01:04:07,260
hear from Shane. Um, first off, F you to Elko, Nevada. I wanted Taco Bell at night because

954
01:04:07,260 --> 01:04:12,740
I hadn't eaten anything all day. And is it so hard to keep your stupid store open until

955
01:04:12,740 --> 01:04:17,380
Like, 10-01, frickin' closing at 10.

956
01:04:17,380 --> 01:04:24,780
F-you to old people, because I was at Taco Bell,

957
01:04:24,780 --> 01:04:28,340
and this old guy slammed his door into my parked car

958
01:04:28,340 --> 01:04:31,620
and tried to blame it on me, because he's old.

959
01:04:31,620 --> 01:04:34,380
And F-you to my living situation,

960
01:04:34,380 --> 01:04:36,100
because I sleep out in the living room,

961
01:04:36,100 --> 01:04:38,700
because they can't seem to find room for me in their rooms.

962
01:04:38,700 --> 01:04:40,420
So, yeah.

963
01:04:40,420 --> 01:04:43,340
and if you did driving the california instead of playing because it's really

964
01:04:43,340 --> 01:04:45,140
boring

965
01:04:45,140 --> 01:04:46,980

966
01:04:46,980 --> 01:04:48,860
yeah i feel like one

967
01:04:48,860 --> 01:04:50,020
medium

968
01:04:50,020 --> 01:04:51,600
by god

969
01:04:51,600 --> 01:04:54,820
how many people in the couch you know

970
01:04:54,820 --> 01:04:56,140
please help

971
01:04:56,140 --> 01:04:57,580
at least three times uh...

972
01:04:57,580 --> 01:04:58,980
well i mean i was a little

973
01:04:58,980 --> 01:05:00,740
each for the matter anyway

974
01:05:00,740 --> 01:05:04,200
when i was trying to make if you go ahead there you should have a little

975
01:05:04,200 --> 01:05:07,900
yeah i was going to have those music stuff in there

976
01:05:07,900 --> 01:05:11,080
well, fuck his stuff. You're more important.

977
01:05:11,080 --> 01:05:15,040
We're trying to kick him out by raising his rent. I was going to say, sorry if you're listening, dude,

978
01:05:15,040 --> 01:05:19,560
but that's not cool to make somebody sleep on the couch unless they're not paying rent if you're being nice.

979
01:05:19,560 --> 01:05:24,560
And my computer's in the corner, so I can't, like, get any privacy.

980
01:05:24,560 --> 01:05:27,200
Oh my God.

981
01:05:27,200 --> 01:05:34,200
You're robbing this man of his Internet pornography. That's horrible. That's great. Jeez.

982
01:05:34,200 --> 01:05:38,200
Anyway, um, yeah, that's all my F's, so...

983
01:05:38,200 --> 01:05:39,200
Thank you.

984
01:05:39,200 --> 01:05:40,200
Andrew.

985
01:05:44,200 --> 01:05:51,200
First of all, Victor, F you to you, you're not funny, I want my name back, I want my jokes back, bitch.

986
01:05:51,200 --> 01:05:53,200
All five of them.

987
01:05:56,200 --> 01:06:01,200
Second of all, F you to people who get my attention by picking up the phone when I'm online.

988
01:06:01,200 --> 01:06:07,200
Stop it. I'm playing Ragnarok. I'm trying to bend.

989
01:06:07,200 --> 01:06:10,200
Don't take the phone into the hand. That would be beautiful.

990
01:06:10,200 --> 01:06:13,200
Either that or I rig up a timer to turn off the TV every time I pick up a phone.

991
01:06:13,200 --> 01:06:18,200
Or just the phone that she uses. Just pull the cord out from the back so she picks it up and doesn't do anything.

992
01:06:18,200 --> 01:06:21,200
Oh, sure. She just goes into the other room and picks up her phone.

993
01:06:21,200 --> 01:06:24,200
Unplug that one too.

994
01:06:24,200 --> 01:06:28,200
We've got door locks, so...

995
01:06:28,200 --> 01:06:36,200
Anyway, uh, F you to Sakura, that song is a bitch, past it, like, what, fifth try.

996
01:06:37,200 --> 01:06:40,200
No, get that whip away from me, Jamie!

997
01:06:40,200 --> 01:06:44,200
In case you guys are wondering, that's the two ferrets tied up with, uh, my whip.

998
01:06:44,200 --> 01:06:45,200
On the webcam.

999
01:06:45,200 --> 01:06:48,200
Yes, on the webcam. So, go ahead, Andy.

1000
01:06:50,200 --> 01:06:55,200
Okay, okay, okay, how about a mutual F you to like in the max, okay? Just to make it balanced.

1001
01:06:55,200 --> 01:06:57,200
Holy shit, she's gonna hit me.

1002
01:07:01,200 --> 01:07:07,200
And once again, f you to Angel not being able to tune in today.

1003
01:07:07,200 --> 01:07:09,200
It's for what? A month and a half.

1004
01:07:09,200 --> 01:07:11,200
Oh shit!

1005
01:07:12,200 --> 01:07:14,200
Parrots flying everywhere!

1006
01:07:18,200 --> 01:07:19,200
Is that Orlando?

1007
01:07:19,200 --> 01:07:20,200
Uh, yeah, that's it.

1008
01:07:20,200 --> 01:07:21,200
Okay.

1009
01:07:22,200 --> 01:07:24,200
Oh, you didn't do it for me? I'm sorry.

1010
01:07:24,200 --> 01:07:26,200
I need to rant a little.

1011
01:07:26,200 --> 01:07:28,200
Come on!

1012
01:07:28,200 --> 01:07:30,200
Jeez, watch out here.

1013
01:07:30,200 --> 01:07:32,200
I don't think any of these balls can sit there.

1014
01:07:32,200 --> 01:07:34,200
Bling that ferret.

1015
01:07:34,200 --> 01:07:36,200
Okay, um...

1016
01:07:36,200 --> 01:07:38,200
Like, uh, yeah, what should I say?

1017
01:07:38,200 --> 01:07:40,200
I don't agree!

1018
01:07:40,200 --> 01:07:44,200
Fuck you to, uh, fuck bad, uh, bike tires

1019
01:07:44,200 --> 01:07:49,200
because my tires on my bike is sitting flat in my room

1020
01:07:49,200 --> 01:07:52,200
because it was broken and I need to get stressed for it.

1021
01:07:52,200 --> 01:07:59,200
And meanwhile, there's Barrett Baseball going on in the living room.

1022
01:07:59,200 --> 01:08:06,200
Look, he almost tripped. I can give play-by-play of Barrett Baseball.

1023
01:08:06,200 --> 01:08:13,200
Look, look. Basing up the middle. Andrew Fielding, the throw home.

1024
01:08:13,200 --> 01:08:35,620
Oh, I'm getting kind of distracted by the fact that Loki is batting a ferret around

1025
01:08:35,620 --> 01:08:36,620
the room.

1026
01:08:36,620 --> 01:08:42,620
And, uh, let's see, well, one of the, that's, damn it, I forgot my FUs!

1027
01:08:42,620 --> 01:08:45,620
Come on, you can remember!

1028
01:08:45,620 --> 01:08:48,620
Don't miss me, Jamie, no!

1029
01:08:50,620 --> 01:08:54,620
I think I have a lot more insanity here!

1030
01:08:54,620 --> 01:08:57,620
I'm gonna back up now.

1031
01:08:57,620 --> 01:09:01,620
I'm going to back up this way out of Jamie's race.

1032
01:09:01,620 --> 01:09:03,620
Ah, barely, yes, out of the race, okay.

1033
01:09:03,620 --> 01:09:30,900
p0k3smot42o

1034
01:09:30,900 --> 01:09:35,900
kostjamrh Hey listen, there's you the ferret. Dear ferret, what do you think of Orangetown's radio?

1035
01:09:42,900 --> 01:09:47,900
kostjamrh Now I can finally change the music, cause it's time for the chat room, if yous.

1036
01:09:53,900 --> 01:09:58,900
kostjamrh Give them something happy.

1037
01:09:58,900 --> 01:10:06,900
Dartsetsuya would like to say F you to comcast, enough said. Thank you.

1038
01:10:06,900 --> 01:10:08,900
It's com crap.

1039
01:10:08,900 --> 01:10:13,900
Evil Naoki2Dx would like to say fuck comcast for sucking major donkey nuts. Thank you.

1040
01:10:13,900 --> 01:10:18,900
Fuck BT Cruisers, fuck Initial D battle whores over a Riptard arcade.

1041
01:10:18,900 --> 01:10:27,900
Fuck elitist anime con goers who bashed on JTAF just because it was a small con and it wasn't exactly like A-X or anime etc.

1042
01:10:27,900 --> 01:10:34,900
I have something to say, in addition to your initial Battleforce comments.

1043
01:10:34,900 --> 01:10:38,900
Yeah, because they start too much drama.

1044
01:10:38,900 --> 01:10:41,900
I don't know why, I don't know why you guys...

1045
01:10:41,900 --> 01:10:43,900
Yeah, that's all it is, just drama.

1046
01:10:43,900 --> 01:10:47,900
Whatever happened to the times when there was no drama, when everyone was happy?

1047
01:10:47,900 --> 01:10:53,900
Why do you think I play at home?

1048
01:10:53,900 --> 01:10:59,940
Yeah, you don't need to start drama over every single person's life, please stop if you read to the board

1049
01:10:59,940 --> 01:11:01,940
I will be very very angry

1050
01:11:04,460 --> 01:11:07,040
Fuck this live 365 operator guy

1051
01:11:07,580 --> 01:11:13,980
Because when they can't connect to the stream when we go out like 365 operator guy comes on says you're listening to station

1052
01:11:13,980 --> 01:11:15,980
But it's currently unavailable. Please check

1053
01:11:16,940 --> 01:11:19,660
It would be better though if they have like some lounge music playing

1054
01:11:20,140 --> 01:11:22,140
Yes, Tom Jones

1055
01:11:22,140 --> 01:11:27,620
Moving on with Eva Maoki, 2DX's nephews, oh and fuck the lazy ass volunteers who didn't

1056
01:11:27,620 --> 01:11:32,020
do shit in the video game room at JTF and just wanted to get into the con for free.

1057
01:11:32,020 --> 01:11:37,060
And fuck the hotel maids at Best Western Miyako Inn for giving me a hard time.

1058
01:11:37,060 --> 01:11:40,100
A hard time.

1059
01:11:40,100 --> 01:11:45,540
And fuck Uni's dad for being such a cheap ass.

1060
01:11:45,540 --> 01:11:50,980
No Stylin says my nephew of the week is screw little rocks you find in charcoal.

1061
01:11:50,980 --> 01:11:54,220
I mean, God, you buy the good brands and you still get little pebbles in there.

1062
01:11:54,220 --> 01:11:55,220
I go, what the fuck?

1063
01:11:55,220 --> 01:11:59,860
I mean, you pay $1.99 for a stick of good old charcoal, and you get this little pebble.

1064
01:11:59,860 --> 01:12:03,420
It just messes up a good drawing, grr.

1065
01:12:03,420 --> 01:12:10,740
Oh, I thought it was barbecue charcoal.

1066
01:12:10,740 --> 01:12:12,980
You can do really good drawings with barbecue charcoal, though.

1067
01:12:12,980 --> 01:12:18,460
John Fields would like to say, F you to my inability to learn new languages quickly.

1068
01:12:18,460 --> 01:12:23,380
F you to Honda for forgetting to order the part for my car and thus wasting my Saturday.

1069
01:12:23,380 --> 01:12:25,980
F you to RCN for not fixing my cable again.

1070
01:12:25,980 --> 01:12:29,860
Hey, at least they're not as bad as code gals.

1071
01:12:29,860 --> 01:12:35,340
F you to my GameCube making weird clicking sounds and causing PSO to crash all the time.

1072
01:12:35,340 --> 01:12:36,340
That's not good.

1073
01:12:36,340 --> 01:12:37,340
What would you...

1074
01:12:37,340 --> 01:12:41,380
What does it mean if a GameCube is making clicking noises?

1075
01:12:41,380 --> 01:12:42,380
That can't be good.

1076
01:12:42,380 --> 01:12:46,820
Victor, you are actually winner for saying that AOL equals Governor Davis.

1077
01:12:46,820 --> 01:12:47,820
Thank you.

1078
01:12:48,820 --> 01:12:51,820

01:12:51,820 --> 01:12:56,820

01:13:32,020 --> 01:13:37,540
once the buffering is coming from the other side for once yeah thanks

1089
01:13:37,540 --> 01:13:43,100

1090
01:13:43,100 --> 01:13:50,100

1096
01:14:19,900 --> 01:14:22,380
Jason would also like to say

1097
01:14:22,380 --> 01:14:26,900
a F.U. to stupid computer crap happening to keep me from listening

1098
01:14:26,900 --> 01:14:29,860
You can blame Comcast, send those cards and letters to Comcast

1099
01:14:29,860 --> 01:14:31,700
Kara of Satan

1100
01:14:31,700 --> 01:14:36,380
StaplerX would like to say F.U. to the assholes of J.T.A.F. also

1101
01:14:36,380 --> 01:14:39,700
They took 10 years off our video program head's life.

1102
01:14:42,700 --> 01:14:46,020
You should let me run a movie room at one of those cons.

1103
01:14:46,020 --> 01:14:47,100
I never found out, though.

1104
01:14:47,100 --> 01:14:49,220
D-Archaholic says, F you to cheap tires.

1105
01:14:49,220 --> 01:14:51,140
I had cheap tires on my car for a while.

1106
01:14:51,140 --> 01:14:53,460
Yesterday, as I got off the freeway going home,

1107
01:14:53,460 --> 01:14:55,220
my steering wheel started to wobble.

1108
01:14:55,220 --> 01:14:58,900
I knew it had to be a tire.

1109
01:14:58,900 --> 01:14:59,660
That's it.

1110
01:14:59,660 --> 01:15:02,660
I have read all the FUs that I have been given.

1111
01:15:02,660 --> 01:15:05,900
So if you'd, oh, did one just pop up?

1112
01:15:05,900 --> 01:15:15,420
I got home and found the driver's side front tire starting to shed its tread.

1113
01:15:15,420 --> 01:15:17,980
I took it to Sears.

1114
01:15:17,980 --> 01:15:19,220
The story is coming in a little bit too.

1115
01:15:19,220 --> 01:15:22,380
While the story is going on, I'm going to say I have read all the FUs at this point.

1116
01:15:22,380 --> 01:15:27,020
If you didn't hear yours due to a buffering issue, sorry, we were just trying to go through

1117
01:15:27,020 --> 01:15:28,760
the show as we usually do.

1118
01:15:28,760 --> 01:15:33,260
The show will play in its entirety without these buffering problems, hopefully, provided

1119
01:15:33,260 --> 01:15:37,500
live 365 isn't using Comcast the show will play through in its entirety on Wednesday

1120
01:15:37,500 --> 01:15:42,180
and Thursday and we might actually we might play it tomorrow night after vanilla sky as

1121
01:15:42,180 --> 01:15:43,180
well.

1122
01:15:43,180 --> 01:15:48,780
DD alcoholic says took it to Sears all four of the tires need to get fixed.

1123
01:15:48,780 --> 01:15:58,200
All four, sucks.

1124
01:15:58,200 --> 01:16:02,140
She says actually only three were bad but she might as well change all four.

1125
01:16:02,140 --> 01:16:08,220
Tonight, what do you guys think?

1126
01:16:08,220 --> 01:16:11,340
I don't know if we should do a cage match tonight because of our issues.

1127
01:16:11,340 --> 01:16:12,340
Yes, we're doing a cage match.

1128
01:16:12,340 --> 01:16:13,340
Well, what about because of our issues?

1129
01:16:13,340 --> 01:16:15,220
The guys aren't going to be able to vote.

1130
01:16:15,220 --> 01:16:17,940
They're not able to stay on the stream long enough to hear a song.

1131
01:16:17,940 --> 01:16:19,940
I went to a lot of trouble.

1132
01:16:19,940 --> 01:16:20,940
Poopy on Comcast.

1133
01:16:20,940 --> 01:16:21,940
I went to a lot of trouble.

1134
01:16:21,940 --> 01:16:22,940
Should we table it to next week?

1135
01:16:22,940 --> 01:16:23,940
Okay.

1136
01:16:23,940 --> 01:16:28,940
Yeah, I think we're going to...

1137
01:16:28,940 --> 01:16:30,360
we could

1138
01:16:30,360 --> 01:16:32,060
okay we could do it this way

1139
01:16:32,060 --> 01:16:35,460
we could instead of, well I don't know, I could say instead of letting the chat room vote

1140
01:16:35,460 --> 01:16:38,560
we could let everybody else here vote but that might be kind of

1141
01:16:38,560 --> 01:16:42,340
tough and biased

1142
01:16:42,340 --> 01:16:44,000
I don't know

1143
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:45,180
what do you guys think?

1144
01:16:45,180 --> 01:16:50,280
Hey, are we going to do cage match and have you guys vote?

1145
01:16:50,280 --> 01:16:54,580
we can try to let the listeners do it, let's see what happens

1146
01:16:54,580 --> 01:16:58,700
let us know what you want to do, do you want us to try cage match?

1147
01:16:58,700 --> 01:17:03,700
5 votes in the chatroom, then we're tabling it over to the room here, so that's what we're

1148
01:17:03,700 --> 01:17:04,700
going to do.

1149
01:17:04,700 --> 01:17:05,700
Okay.

1150
01:17:05,700 --> 01:17:08,700
It's not a big deal, but it's pretty nice.

1151
01:17:08,700 --> 01:17:09,700
Oh, sorry.

1152
01:17:09,700 --> 01:17:10,700
She didn't write earlier.

1153
01:17:10,700 --> 01:17:11,700
Okay.

1154
01:17:11,700 --> 01:17:12,700
That's okay.

1155
01:17:12,700 --> 01:17:13,700
It happens.

1156
01:17:13,700 --> 01:17:14,700
Okay.

1157
01:17:14,700 --> 01:17:18,500
They're saying the stream's okay right now, so we're going to do the cage match right

1158
01:17:18,500 --> 01:17:19,500
now.

1159
01:17:19,500 --> 01:17:20,500
Why not?

1160
01:17:20,500 --> 01:17:21,500
Let's just get into it.

1161
01:17:21,500 --> 01:17:24,700
We're doing a commercial free show tonight, apparently.

1162
01:17:24,700 --> 01:17:25,700
That's all right.

1163
01:17:25,700 --> 01:17:29,620
the money's too commercial anyway

1164
01:17:29,620 --> 01:17:31,100
hahaha

1165
01:17:31,100 --> 01:17:32,580
i was funny

1166
01:17:32,580 --> 01:17:35,060
and no one noticed

1167
01:17:35,060 --> 01:17:36,500
hahaha

1168
01:17:36,500 --> 01:17:40,020
last week in the orange lawns radio cage match

1169
01:17:40,020 --> 01:17:44,140
the mp3 that i was sent from dr angel one

1170
01:17:44,140 --> 01:17:48,580
and it was a mislabeled mp3 actually i found out a little just after the show

1171
01:17:48,580 --> 01:17:51,220
i found out the mp3 was actually mislabeled

1172
01:17:51,220 --> 01:17:53,740
you voted for the wrong thing actually

1173
01:17:53,740 --> 01:18:00,920
I said on the show that it was a band called Froggy that won, it's actually Foggy, no R.

1174
01:18:00,920 --> 01:18:05,740
So the band that actually won last night was Foggy, I'm sorry last week, last week, was

1175
01:18:05,740 --> 01:18:09,380
Foggy and the song is called Come Into My Dream.

1176
01:18:09,380 --> 01:18:12,340
So this is the song that won last week.

1177
01:18:12,340 --> 01:18:13,340
Huh?

1178
01:18:13,340 --> 01:18:14,340
You wet?

1179
01:18:14,340 --> 01:18:17,340
Are you downloading the show?

1180
01:18:17,340 --> 01:18:18,340
Oh good.

1181
01:18:18,340 --> 01:18:21,300
Alright, so here it is.

1182
01:18:21,300 --> 01:18:26,100
Um, this is the first song you can vote for tonight.

1183
01:18:27,100 --> 01:18:28,260
Why are you guys laughing?

1184
01:18:29,020 --> 01:18:29,620
Chat room.

1185
01:18:30,620 --> 01:18:33,420
Chat room says, just died.

1186
01:18:33,420 --> 01:18:36,260
As he said, do it this, they say the stream's okay right now.

1187
01:18:36,260 --> 01:18:39,220
So we're going to do, and apparently we dropped right there.

1188
01:18:41,340 --> 01:18:45,300
I think it's still going to work enough for the, uh, for the case match.

1189
01:18:45,300 --> 01:18:52,300
so

1190
01:18:53,440 --> 01:18:58,660
i'm gonna continue

1191
01:18:58,660 --> 01:19:01,940
you know what my monitor stream is still going so

1192
01:19:01,940 --> 01:19:05,940
i think they'll be able to get in

1193
01:19:05,940 --> 01:19:12,540
soooo cage match

1194
01:19:12,540 --> 01:19:18,540
Since we're having a moment of dead airspace, let's offer a moment of silence for our stream.

1195
01:20:42,540 --> 01:21:02,540
Let me show you where I've been It's you and me I've seen

1196
01:21:02,540 --> 01:21:09,540
Let me tell you what I mean In the deep blue sky

1197
01:21:09,540 --> 01:21:16,540
There were rainbows in the night, you and me to fly

1198
01:21:16,540 --> 01:21:20,540
And the ocean shines so bright

1199
01:21:20,540 --> 01:21:25,540
And the ocean shines so bright

1200
01:21:50,540 --> 01:22:13,040
That was a clip of song number one, last week's winner, Foggy with Come Into My Dream.

1201
01:22:13,040 --> 01:22:20,120
Once again, since we're still having some bad connectivity problems, if we don't get

1202
01:22:20,120 --> 01:22:23,320
enough people in the chat room and please don't vote chat room you're on your honor

1203
01:22:23,320 --> 01:22:28,460
tonight please don't vote unless you heard enough of the song where you think you can

1204
01:22:28,460 --> 01:22:32,880
make an honest vote of all the three songs so if we don't get enough votes from the chat

1205
01:22:32,880 --> 01:22:40,240
room we're going to vote in house so because of that i'm going to only ask for scores and

1206
01:22:40,240 --> 01:22:47,140
feedback from the hosts on the next two songs usually usually we let the whole room comment

1207
01:23:17,140 --> 01:23:19,440
and I had it on repeat for a while

1208
01:23:19,440 --> 01:23:24,080
and then I think that I just had it on my playlist I put it in there because

1209
01:23:24,080 --> 01:23:28,900
I didn't really put any thought into it

1210
01:23:28,900 --> 01:23:31,840
alright, so you ready to hit?

1211
01:23:31,840 --> 01:23:38,840
It's Free Fall featuring Jan Johnston with Skydive.

1212
01:24:31,840 --> 01:24:56,840
The first moment before the first touch When you're alone, we have to hold each other

1213
01:24:56,840 --> 01:25:00,840
I've been drawn in love, now stuck away beneath

1214
01:25:00,840 --> 01:25:06,840
Now we're here, we have our own language

1215
01:25:17,840 --> 01:25:24,840
I feel wonderful, I could spell out all my sorrow

1216
01:25:24,840 --> 01:25:27,840
I say, oh, she's my friend

1217
01:25:27,840 --> 01:25:32,840
I'm a fan of sex when my friend screams my name

1218
01:25:32,840 --> 01:25:36,840
I take it as I pray

1219
01:25:36,840 --> 01:25:43,840
To run, run, run, to the moon

1220
01:25:43,840 --> 01:25:48,840
I feel like falling

1221
01:25:59,840 --> 01:26:02,840
This is me before the finish

1222
01:26:02,840 --> 01:26:07,840
You know the money we have to hold each other

1223
01:26:07,840 --> 01:26:11,840
As we travel in love, we suffocate your knees

1224
01:26:11,840 --> 01:26:13,840
Now we're here

1225
01:26:13,840 --> 01:26:17,840
We have our own language

1226
01:26:27,840 --> 01:26:29,840
Connect your words

1227
01:26:29,840 --> 01:26:31,840
I haven't really gone

1228
01:26:31,840 --> 01:26:33,840
Excited to smile

1229
01:26:33,840 --> 01:26:37,840
Even if you're in my sleep

1230
01:26:41,840 --> 01:26:44,840
No wish, no lust, no lie

1231
01:26:44,840 --> 01:26:47,840
As true as our love

1232
01:26:47,840 --> 01:26:49,840
You're my hero

1233
01:26:49,840 --> 01:26:53,840
Heaven did you come

1234
01:27:19,840 --> 01:27:46,340
I feel wonderful, I can start out from the moon

1235
01:27:46,340 --> 01:27:54,980
I sail an ocean on my feathers as the wind screams my name

1236
01:27:54,980 --> 01:28:06,180
Take your hand and pray to run, run, run to you, you, you

1237
01:28:06,180 --> 01:28:14,820
I feel wonderful like a skydive on the moon

1238
01:28:14,820 --> 01:28:21,340
I feel a shiver on my bed with a smile on the bed

1239
01:28:21,340 --> 01:28:29,060
Scream my name, take it out, I'm afraid to run, run, run

1240
01:28:29,060 --> 01:28:34,060
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

1241
01:28:59,060 --> 01:29:06,060
free fall featuring Jan Johnston with skydive let's go around and see what the host thought

1242
01:29:06,060 --> 01:29:13,060
Free Fall featuring Jan Johnston with Skydive, let's go around and see what the hosts thought

1243
01:29:36,060 --> 01:29:43,060
and

1244
01:29:43,680 --> 01:29:46,140
why don't we please

1245
01:29:46,140 --> 01:29:47,200
you don't give

1246
01:29:47,200 --> 01:29:51,960
replace uh... politically jim johnson that would be awesome good idea to your

1247
01:29:51,960 --> 01:29:55,380
konami

1248
01:29:55,380 --> 01:29:58,520
uh... so there you go we wouldn't usually this point go around and see

1249
01:29:58,520 --> 01:30:01,400
what our other guests that we don't care what they think we don't care what they

1250
01:30:01,400 --> 01:30:02,180
think no

1251
01:30:02,180 --> 01:30:02,860
no

1252
01:30:02,860 --> 01:30:04,860
What did you pick today?

1253
01:30:04,860 --> 01:30:10,860
I picked this one because, you know, whatever. I made it today. It's cool, I guess.

1254
01:30:10,860 --> 01:30:17,860
It's the Fly, the 2003 Burst mix. It's just a Burst style, I should say.

1255
01:30:17,860 --> 01:30:25,860
Blatantly ripping off of the, what is it, B-Rock You, 1998 Burst style.

1256
01:30:25,860 --> 01:30:30,860
The Fly 2003 Burst Style Loki Vs. The Deep Project

1257
01:30:55,860 --> 01:31:02,860
Alright, well let's have a listen anyway. It's Loki versus Deep Project with the Fly 2003 mix. Here it is, song number three.

1258
01:33:55,860 --> 01:33:57,860
LOKI VS DEEP PROJECT

1259
01:34:25,860 --> 01:34:38,860
I feel a little uneducated to make a vote because I'm not familiar enough with the original song, so I'm not sure how much it was actually remixed, but it sounded very much like a video game racing song. It was very good. I liked it.

1260
01:34:38,860 --> 01:34:46,860
I thought you said you mixed it with electro-tune, but I don't hear it. Is it really sped up or something?

1261
01:35:16,860 --> 01:35:21,500
the legend of trance to begin with because now i have to live up to that and that sucks

1262
01:35:21,500 --> 01:35:24,780
you still need to know the one that i asked for

1263
01:35:24,780 --> 01:35:28,500
was it the safari trance one no the safari trance one just won't work because no one's

1264
01:35:28,500 --> 01:35:29,660
that talented

1265
01:35:29,660 --> 01:35:34,060
well then what's the one you wanted to hear the one with um...

1266
01:35:34,060 --> 01:35:37,860
what was that release your mind

1267
01:35:37,860 --> 01:35:40,300

chance to listen one more time because I know you are right okay yeah exactly so

1276
01:36:13,440 --> 01:36:17,440
A little bit of extended clips here, but just enough so you can get an idea of what's going on.

1277
01:36:17,440 --> 01:36:22,440
Here we go, first up, last week's winner, song number one, Foggy, Come Into My Dream.

1284
01:38:15,460 --> 01:38:18,740
And then we'll look at them in a little bit.

1285
01:38:18,740 --> 01:38:21,660
Otherwise, chat room, if you guys were able to follow us,

1286
01:38:21,660 --> 01:38:27,340
place votes now, or a private message

1287
01:38:27,340 --> 01:38:28,940
to sky in the chat room.

1288
01:38:28,940 --> 01:38:30,540
Anyways, you wanted me to mention this,

1289
01:38:30,540 --> 01:38:32,620
because I mentioned this the other day,

1290
01:38:32,620 --> 01:38:34,660
and because it's also one of the songs I sampled,

1291
01:38:34,660 --> 01:38:38,540
which I might add was not very remixed, but whatever.

1292
01:38:38,540 --> 01:38:40,740
I added a better drum beat to it, and that's it.

1293
01:38:40,740 --> 01:38:41,740
Whoopee doo.

1294
01:38:41,740 --> 01:38:47,820
Anyways, so anyways, I was going to mention that F-Zero GX has three songs that sample

1295
01:38:47,820 --> 01:38:53,580
the song, or actually three songs that remixes the song, The Fly by The Deep Project, which

1296
01:38:53,580 --> 01:39:01,020
also, you might remember, was also sampled in The Legend of Max, which, shut up, you're

1297
01:39:01,020 --> 01:39:06,660
not even on mic, so shut up, shut up, shut up, okay, anyways, so, I was going to play

1298
01:39:06,660 --> 01:39:11,820
Well, clips from the three songs. Let's see here. Let's start off with the first one,

1299
01:39:11,820 --> 01:39:17,980
which was, it's basically these are all the character music for the characters in F-Zero

1300
01:39:17,980 --> 01:39:23,460
GX. We'll start off with Deathborn, which is one of the characters. And we played this

1301
01:39:23,460 --> 01:39:38,460
for my um, let's see anyways. Okay, here we go. Deathborn, that's a remix of a fly, believe

1302
01:39:38,460 --> 01:39:46,580
it or not, which is kind of neat. And then we've also got Blood Falcon's theme, which

1303
01:39:46,580 --> 01:39:55,340
was the one that I remixed, barely. I know it sucked. And it's probably a lot better

1304
01:39:55,340 --> 01:40:00,620
without the crap that I threw on top of it. But anyway, that's Blood Falcon's theme. And

1305
01:40:00,620 --> 01:40:04,500
then we have Black Shadow's theme, which I wanted to remix, but it just didn't work.

1306
01:40:04,500 --> 01:40:11,500
so uh...

1307
01:40:15,300 --> 01:40:20,620
anyway, this is just on Mission X, so it's kinda neat

1308
01:40:20,620 --> 01:40:23,660
F-Zero rocks, cause it's fast

1309
01:40:23,660 --> 01:40:25,520
but uh...

1310
01:40:25,520 --> 01:40:31,860
I admit, I knew from the get-go that that remix wasn't that great

1311
01:40:31,860 --> 01:40:37,220
right now it's gonna throw it in there anyways and cuz I just didn't care be

1312
01:40:37,220 --> 01:40:39,460
glad I didn't choose a chicken dance or something like that

1313
01:40:39,460 --> 01:40:46,780
Oh Rob speaking of the chicken dance there's some place that for the pre-show

1314
01:40:46,780 --> 01:40:49,380
and here in the break

1315
01:40:49,380 --> 01:41:04,220
I only got one vote for cage match from the chat room, so I think we're going to go ahead

1316
01:41:04,220 --> 01:41:07,300
and reveal the winner here, okay?

1317
01:41:07,300 --> 01:41:09,340
Alright, you guys ready?

Who is the winner?

1321
01:41:22,700 --> 01:41:27,860

01:41:27,860 --> 01:41:38,260

01:42:08,940 --> 01:42:11,400
it can't be a tie with five people, impossible

1330
01:42:11,400 --> 01:42:15,220
unless somebody didn't write a vote

1331
01:42:15,220 --> 01:42:16,220
Song number three.

1332
01:42:16,220 --> 01:42:17,740
So Loki's song has two votes.

1333
01:42:17,740 --> 01:42:18,820
Jamie's song has one vote.

1334
01:42:25,940 --> 01:42:29,060
So here's a vote for song one, coming to my dreams.

1335
01:42:29,060 --> 01:42:32,660
So now we have one vote for song one, one vote for song two,

1336
01:42:32,660 --> 01:42:34,220
and two votes for song three.

1337
01:42:34,220 --> 01:42:36,540
It is possible to have a tie with five votes.

1338
01:42:36,540 --> 01:42:37,040
It is.

1339
01:42:37,040 --> 01:42:37,700
Two and two and one.

1340
01:42:37,700 --> 01:42:38,000
Right.

1341
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:39,920
We might have a tie right here, but that's OK,

1342
01:42:39,920 --> 01:42:43,780
because remember, in case of a tie, the host picks.

1343
01:42:43,780 --> 01:42:45,340
the host who didn't get picked.

1344
01:42:45,340 --> 01:42:47,580
So here it is, the last vote.

1345
01:42:47,580 --> 01:42:49,900
So if it's a vote for song three, song three wins.

1346
01:42:49,900 --> 01:42:52,660
If it's a vote for song one or two, we have a tie.

1347
01:42:52,660 --> 01:42:53,180
Ready?

1348
01:42:56,540 --> 01:43:00,340
Ah, it's a vote for song number one.

1349
01:43:00,340 --> 01:43:05,660
So we have a tie between Foggy and Loki's pick,

1350
01:43:05,660 --> 01:43:06,540
song number three.

1351
01:43:06,540 --> 01:43:09,580
So Jamie, what?

1352
01:43:09,580 --> 01:43:10,620
Who should I vote for?

1353
01:43:10,620 --> 01:43:11,940
Who should you vote for?

1354
01:43:11,940 --> 01:43:17,940
I am getting some votes from the chat room.

1355
01:43:17,940 --> 01:43:18,940
Do you want to hear this?

1356
01:43:18,940 --> 01:43:19,940
Add them in.

1357
01:43:19,940 --> 01:43:20,940
Add them in?

1358
01:43:20,940 --> 01:43:21,940
Well, this is what's interesting.

1359
01:43:21,940 --> 01:43:22,940
Okay, we're going to add them in.

1360
01:43:22,940 --> 01:43:26,940
I don't have to make any decisions, yay.

1361
01:43:26,940 --> 01:43:29,100
Marin actually, well, this is the complicated thing.

1362
01:43:29,100 --> 01:43:33,820
Marin actually, oh, I shouldn't be saying who voted for what because I usually don't.

1363
01:43:33,820 --> 01:43:34,820
My bad.

1364
01:43:34,820 --> 01:43:35,820
Well, it's okay.

1365
01:43:35,820 --> 01:43:36,820
She voted for song two.

1366
01:43:36,820 --> 01:43:37,820
So, that gives us a three-way tie.

1367
01:43:37,820 --> 01:43:38,820
So, we're back to square one.

1368
01:43:38,820 --> 01:43:39,820
Put them all in.

1369
01:44:09,820 --> 01:44:16,700
This is a tough decision. This is a tough decision. I'll tell you why. I'll tell you

1370
01:44:16,700 --> 01:44:20,540
why this is a tough decision. Because Jamie hasn't won in a little while. I've actually

1371
01:44:20,540 --> 01:44:23,580
been winning the cage match. She hasn't won in a while. So I kind of feel bad. So I'm

1372
01:44:23,580 --> 01:44:27,740
like, okay, maybe we should let Jamie win. And I did like her song. On the other hand,

1373
01:44:27,740 --> 01:44:32,460
Loki put a lot of work into his song. Jamie just, Jamie just gets a song from the internet,

1374
01:44:32,460 --> 01:44:37,500
but Loki made his. If you want to feel better, I didn't put that much effort into that. Really,

1375
01:44:37,500 --> 01:44:38,500
I did not.

1376
01:44:38,500 --> 01:44:43,500
The song I picked, though, I was going to pick the Chicken Dance Techno mix.

1377
01:44:43,500 --> 01:44:46,500
Oh, God, I would have voted for that, no problem.

1378
01:44:46,500 --> 01:44:49,500
Wait, I have a happy alternative.

1379
01:44:49,500 --> 01:44:54,500
How about we just take the song that I sampled for the Fly remix, since it's better anyways.

1380
01:44:54,500 --> 01:44:58,500
It's a lot cleaner, doesn't have the loud drum beat over the top of it.

1381
01:44:58,500 --> 01:45:03,500
We'll use that instead of mine.

1382
01:45:03,500 --> 01:45:07,500
I'm thinking I'm going to give it to Jamie tonight.

1383
01:45:37,500 --> 01:45:55,980
Have a conversation and now we let the ferrets talk to you.

1384
01:45:55,980 --> 01:46:03,380
Alright so there's the cage match kind of a little bit fucked up.

1385
01:46:03,380 --> 01:46:10,380
uh...

1386
01:46:10,780 --> 01:46:13,200
uh...

1387
01:46:13,200 --> 01:46:14,340
i think uh...

1388
01:46:14,340 --> 01:46:15,920
them and i think i know

1389
01:46:15,920 --> 01:46:20,340
who isn't there actually some of the money news going on right now no

1390
01:46:20,340 --> 01:46:24,400
yes there is i think we have something he wants to share with you all

1391
01:46:24,400 --> 01:46:27,000
people still play that the money crap

1392
01:46:27,000 --> 01:46:27,800
right

1393
01:46:27,800 --> 01:46:30,880
well let's see uh... what are you got going here

1394
01:46:30,880 --> 01:46:39,240
Well, I know that there's the, um, what was it, the new, um, the Tokyo Gaming Show is

1395
01:46:39,240 --> 01:46:44,040
going on right now, and I know that they had, um, a bunch of Konami games, um, that they

1396
01:46:44,040 --> 01:46:45,040
were showing up.

1397
01:46:45,040 --> 01:46:51,320
Uh, let's see, we've got, um, we've got our internet not working, and, um, okay, here

1398
01:46:51,320 --> 01:46:52,320
we go.

1399
01:46:52,320 --> 01:46:53,320
Uh, the modem's up.

1400
01:46:53,320 --> 01:46:54,320
I know, it's just being slow.

1401
01:46:54,320 --> 01:46:59,480
Anyways, um, there was, um, of course they were showing off DDRStream, which we now pretty

1402
01:46:59,480 --> 01:47:06,440
much know it's going to be exactly like Max 2 is right now. What are you doing? That's

1403
01:47:06,440 --> 01:47:12,400
fine. Anyways, so you have, you know, DDR Extreme obviously was coming out and of course,

1404
01:47:12,400 --> 01:47:17,180
you know, it's pretty much featuring the same stuff as Max 2 USA is, you know, as far as

1405
01:47:17,180 --> 01:47:22,580
the enhanced, you know, diet mode and that kind of stuff. Then there's a new DDR game

1406
01:47:22,580 --> 01:47:29,440
which I'm trying to find a name for right now. Party Mix, I guess. Fancier Revolution

1407
01:47:29,440 --> 01:47:50,240
It's Dance Dance Revolution Party Collection, in other words I think it's Dance Dance Revolution

1408
01:47:50,240 --> 01:47:52,200
Best Hits number 2.

1409
01:47:52,200 --> 01:47:56,320
And you're pretty much going to have, you know, it looks like it's going to be based

1410
01:47:56,320 --> 01:47:59,680
off the DDR Extreme Engine, you know, they don't really show anything other than Diet

1411
01:47:59,680 --> 01:48:07,840
Mode and, you know, standard beginner stuff. So, it has beginner and Diet Mode, you know.

1412
01:48:07,840 --> 01:48:14,680
Other than that, no, obviously, there's going to be, you know, DDR Max coming out next Thursday

1413
01:48:14,680 --> 01:48:22,720
or Wednesday, days away. And so, we'll be getting that if I have money. And then, what

1414
01:48:22,720 --> 01:48:31,500
else. Oh, yeah, we've also got kind of segue into SimNews. StepMania is at StepMania 3.9

1415
01:48:31,500 --> 01:48:40,220
Alpha 5. And so, one thing that's fully supported now is the Dance Magic Mode that's fully supported

1416
01:48:40,220 --> 01:48:47,940
now. It works. It's done. And another thing I thought I'd mention because a lot of SimSites

1417
01:48:47,940 --> 01:48:59,440
are down and you can't find your sim files. But now, now you can go find all your known

1418
01:48:59,440 --> 01:49:08,020
official sim files at www.ddramerica.com slash bttracker and you'll have all your torrents

1419
01:49:08,020 --> 01:49:15,460
for every single, every single like batch, you know, collection of files that was featured

1420
01:49:45,460 --> 01:49:47,460
One second, go!

1421
01:49:47,460 --> 01:49:49,460
Okay, got it.

1422
01:49:49,460 --> 01:49:51,460
Ferret tail sack from the cab.

1423
01:49:51,460 --> 01:49:54,460
Hot ferret action!

1424
01:49:54,460 --> 01:49:57,460
Yeah, that's pretty much that, and um...

1425
01:49:57,460 --> 01:50:00,460
In other news, my cabinet's coming along quite nicely.

1426
01:50:00,460 --> 01:50:02,460
That's it, yeah.

1427
01:50:02,460 --> 01:50:04,460
That's all your Bumani news.

1428
01:50:04,460 --> 01:50:06,460
Oh, and um...

1429
01:50:06,460 --> 01:50:08,460
Yeah, Tack did something, and uh...

1430
01:50:08,460 --> 01:50:10,460
What?

1431
01:50:10,460 --> 01:50:12,460
And Davey perks up like a cat.

1432
01:50:12,460 --> 01:50:17,460
What did my man do? I still have to marry him, you know.

1433
01:50:17,460 --> 01:50:26,460
Well, actually, I was going to mention this. I'm trying to remember where I saw it. I think it was Bomani Style. Oh, I say Bomani Style.

1434
01:50:26,460 --> 01:50:41,460
Thanks, I forgot about that. F you to Bomani Style for putting music on your front page. You suck. What are you thinking? Seriously, okay, now, actually, we really, really like Bomani Style. We do, Logie, we do.

1435
01:50:41,460 --> 01:50:45,460
I don't like your music. Your music sucks.

1436
01:50:45,460 --> 01:50:50,460
I don't mind it being flash, because DDR Maniacs is the same thing.

1437
01:50:50,460 --> 01:50:56,460
DDR Maniacs puts a cookie on your computer so that if you turn it off, it stays off every time you go there.

1438
01:50:56,460 --> 01:51:01,460
If you want it on, you leave it on. But I don't like it on. I like it off.

1439
01:51:01,460 --> 01:51:04,460
It looks like they took down all the media.

1440
01:51:04,460 --> 01:51:06,460
Well, that's because of TAC.

1441
01:51:06,460 --> 01:51:08,460
They took down the media because of TAC.

1442
01:51:08,460 --> 01:51:11,420
You can thank TAC for all the media being gone on

1443
01:51:13,460 --> 01:51:19,180
Yeah, so but anyways I was gonna say that um, there's that um, what was it that beat mania

1444
01:51:20,180 --> 01:51:22,180
concert live thingy

1445
01:51:22,700 --> 01:51:24,300
2dx

1446
01:51:24,300 --> 01:51:26,300
Yeah, 2dx secret concert

1447
01:51:26,860 --> 01:51:28,860
super secret concert anyways

1448
01:51:29,580 --> 01:51:31,580
that was going on and

1449
01:51:31,860 --> 01:51:35,060
There supposedly there was some new songs brought out

1450
01:51:35,060 --> 01:51:41,420
for that. I'm trying to see if I can pull this up here. I just want to say really

1451
01:51:41,420 --> 01:51:45,420
quickly because Jamie's going what huh? If you actually read there's a big long

1452
01:51:45,420 --> 01:51:48,020
post on BimaniStyle where they talked about where they're taking down the

1453
01:51:48,020 --> 01:51:53,360
media and basically most people kind of know by now that read the forums

1454
01:51:53,360 --> 01:51:57,180
frequently of BimaniStyle that TAC has been in touch with the people that run

1455
01:51:57,180 --> 01:52:01,780
BimaniStyle.com and that they were going to try and find a way to

1456
01:52:01,780 --> 01:52:03,740
to distribute Bounce Connected in the US

1457
01:52:03,740 --> 01:52:05,820
through bimanistyle.com.

1458
01:52:05,820 --> 01:52:08,540
And somehow along the way, though, it's

1459
01:52:08,540 --> 01:52:09,540
kind of been inferred.

1460
01:52:09,540 --> 01:52:11,380
And I haven't seen a confirmation

1461
01:52:11,380 --> 01:52:15,100
in this thread of this or whatever, but somehow it

1462
01:52:15,100 --> 01:52:17,140
got around that Tack actually asked

1463
01:52:17,140 --> 01:52:20,020
that the media be stopped.

1464
01:52:20,020 --> 01:52:21,740
Which is interesting because I had also

1465
01:52:21,740 --> 01:52:23,820
heard that he didn't mind so much because he

1466
01:52:23,820 --> 01:52:26,340
was excited that people outside of Japan

1467
01:52:26,340 --> 01:52:27,840
liked his music so much.

1468
01:52:27,840 --> 01:52:30,220
So I don't know, it could have.

1469
01:52:30,220 --> 01:52:37,600
It could be a combination of things though, also if you look in this thread you read a

1470
01:52:37,600 --> 01:52:42,160
lot about bandwidth whores and things like that, people that just leech all day long

1471
01:52:42,160 --> 01:52:45,780
and stuff and they kind of want to explore other parts of what they could do with a money

1472
01:52:45,780 --> 01:52:48,660
styler than just being a leech in today's place.

1473
01:52:48,660 --> 01:52:49,660
That makes sense.

1474
01:52:49,660 --> 01:52:53,900
Anyways, I was going to say that the 2DX here at Live Party Performances, here is the playlist

1475
01:52:53,900 --> 01:52:55,560
for the performances.

1476
01:52:55,560 --> 01:53:02,120
You had set one which is by Tack and he did abstract, electro tunes, slag work, stoic,

1477
01:53:02,120 --> 01:53:06,740
holic, D-X-Y, quasar and traces, so that was kind of neat.

1478
01:53:06,740 --> 01:53:11,660
And then you have Slake was set two, did Breeding, Music to Your Head and a new song which is

1479
01:53:11,660 --> 01:53:14,100
untitled right now.

1480
01:53:14,100 --> 01:53:19,260
Set three was done by Whack which did Linus, Spica, Over the Clouds instead of Regulus,

1481
01:53:19,260 --> 01:53:22,820
Make a Difference, Murmur Twins, Linus and Moon Child.

1482
01:53:22,820 --> 01:53:32,220
And then Akira Yamaoka did Bitmania, In My Eyes, Rizlim, some song in Japanese, a new

1483
01:53:32,220 --> 01:53:43,820
song with no title, and then Good Cool did Never Let You Down, Spin This, Your Body,

1484
01:53:43,820 --> 01:53:45,180
Come With Me, and Spooky.

1485
01:53:45,180 --> 01:53:53,500
And Naoki did Prelude, B-Rocky, and Platonic XXX, the new song that he's going to be doing.

1486
01:53:53,500 --> 01:54:00,660
Then you have DJ Taka, which is Tomorrow's Perfume, Colors, Pandora, the new song by

1487
01:54:00,660 --> 01:54:05,080
DJ Taka, Motion 2003, and Rainbow Flyer, the vocal version.

1488
01:54:05,080 --> 01:54:09,460
So that was kind of neat, and hopefully we'll get MP3s of those new songs soon.

1489
01:54:09,460 --> 01:54:13,380
And the vocal version of Rainbow Flyer was actually not done by Sana, it was done by

1490
01:54:13,380 --> 01:54:21,380
Noria was actually there. Noria being the one that did Glorious Days and the Happy Handbag Song in 9 style. Can't remember what the hell it's called.

1491
01:54:21,380 --> 01:54:27,380
And, uh, Platonic- I'm just picturing the video where she's holding the little happy handbag. What the hell's it called? I know, I can't remember the name of it either.

1492
01:54:27,380 --> 01:54:35,380
Anyways, Platonic XXX is supposed to sound like a Japanese version of Secret Rendezvous with rapping.

1493
01:54:35,380 --> 01:54:35,880
What?

1494
01:54:36,380 --> 01:54:36,880
Yeah

1495
01:54:37,380 --> 01:54:38,380
With rapping

1496
01:54:39,380 --> 01:54:42,380
So you know what that means, it's probably gonna be the next DDR so I mean that's kinda cool

1497
01:54:43,380 --> 01:54:44,380
I don't think that's a bad thing

1498
01:54:44,380 --> 01:54:45,380
I mean it's not bad

1499
01:54:45,380 --> 01:54:46,380
Jeez

1500
01:54:47,380 --> 01:54:48,380
Sylvia Drive

1501
01:54:49,380 --> 01:54:50,380
That's what I was trying to get Sylvia Drive

1502
01:54:50,380 --> 01:54:51,380
I love it

1503
01:54:51,380 --> 01:54:57,380
That's a great, that's a great signature right there

1504
01:54:58,380 --> 01:54:59,380
Nigga stole my bike

1505
01:55:03,380 --> 01:55:04,380
Sorry

1506
01:55:04,380 --> 01:55:06,380
Put that up on the TV thing!

1507
01:55:34,380 --> 01:55:43,420
The far microphone is supposed to stay on on the microphone, and the far microphone

1508
01:55:43,420 --> 01:55:49,420
is supposed to stay far away, and the closed microphone is supposed to stay close.

1509
01:55:49,420 --> 01:55:50,420
Intercepted!

1510
01:55:50,420 --> 01:55:51,420
Yes, Ritz.

1511
01:55:51,420 --> 01:55:52,420
Ritz are mine.

1512
01:55:52,420 --> 01:55:53,420
God dammit.

1513
01:55:53,420 --> 01:55:54,420
I want Nilla Wafers now.

1514
01:55:54,420 --> 01:55:55,420
Oh yes.

1515
01:55:55,420 --> 01:56:02,420
And you get like two and a half crackers.

1516
01:56:02,420 --> 01:56:04,420
And you get like two and a half crackers.

1517
01:56:04,420 --> 01:56:06,420
Yes, this will do nicely.

1518
01:56:06,420 --> 01:56:08,420
And Eric can have the empty box.

1519
01:56:08,420 --> 01:56:10,420
Oh yeah, you know you like it.

1520
01:56:10,420 --> 01:56:12,420
Hahahaha.

1521
01:56:12,420 --> 01:56:13,420
Hahahaha.

1522
01:56:13,420 --> 01:56:14,420
Mmm yeah.

1523
01:56:14,420 --> 01:56:17,420
Snap into a Ritz.

1524
01:56:17,420 --> 01:56:20,420
FU to Pringles because they suck.

1525
01:56:20,420 --> 01:56:22,420
It tastes like crap.

1526
01:56:22,420 --> 01:56:23,420
Pringles?

1527
01:56:23,420 --> 01:56:24,420
The original Pringles suck.

1528
01:56:24,420 --> 01:56:25,420
No, no, no.

1529
01:56:25,420 --> 01:56:30,420
The original Pringles, Pringles now, Pringles in the future will all suck.

1530
01:56:30,420 --> 01:56:34,420
F.U. Delays for trying to copy Pringles and put their stuff in a can.

1531
01:56:34,420 --> 01:56:38,420
Just because you put your chips in a can does not make them any better.

1532
01:56:38,420 --> 01:56:43,420
And what is up with Pib Extra? What is extra about Pib Extra? It tastes exactly the same.

1533
01:56:43,420 --> 01:56:51,420
I have no idea.

1534
01:56:51,420 --> 01:56:53,420
basic physics arid

1535
01:56:53,420 --> 01:56:55,420
fling box

1536
01:56:55,420 --> 01:56:56,420
ferret go

1537
01:56:56,420 --> 01:56:58,420
insert ferret into ritz box

1538
01:56:58,420 --> 01:57:00,420
insert ferret towards end of ritz box

1539
01:57:00,420 --> 01:57:02,420
fling ritz box

1540
01:57:02,420 --> 01:57:04,420
ferret flies

1541
01:57:04,420 --> 01:57:06,420
um

1542
01:57:06,420 --> 01:57:08,420
are we done about news?

1543
01:57:08,420 --> 01:57:09,420
i'm done

1544
01:57:09,420 --> 01:57:11,420
i'm thinking you guys

1545
01:57:11,420 --> 01:57:13,420
what do you guys think about just making

1546
01:57:13,420 --> 01:57:15,420
where'd jamie go?

1547
01:57:15,420 --> 01:57:17,420
what are you guys thinking about just making it a two hour show tonight?

1548
01:57:17,420 --> 01:57:19,420
just like old days

1549
01:57:19,420 --> 01:57:26,420
Because we have new listeners, we're pretty much done with a lot of our topics, can't really interact with the chatroom tonight, so...

1550
01:57:26,420 --> 01:57:31,420
We're pretty much dead in the water, and we can all thank Comcast for that, cunts.

1551
01:57:31,420 --> 01:57:33,420
No, we don't have to know our...

1552
01:57:33,420 --> 01:57:34,420
So, um...

1553
01:57:34,420 --> 01:57:36,420
No listeners, huh? Not very many listeners?

1554
01:57:36,420 --> 01:57:38,420
Well, I mean, no, we have...

1555
01:57:38,420 --> 01:57:43,420
God bless the chatroom, they're trying to get in, they're hammering to get in, they're just trying their best...

1556
01:57:43,420 --> 01:57:47,420
Stop ramming the stream!

1557
01:57:47,420 --> 01:57:52,500
Everyone give a fuck you to live 365 for this sucking no no no it's not it's not

1558
01:57:52,500 --> 01:57:58,700
why 365 it's Comcast and life is just five link is fucked up so it's more

1559
01:57:58,700 --> 01:58:03,660
Comcast fault 365 should be over the head of being hammered their frickin

1560
01:58:03,660 --> 01:58:07,340
internet radio station that hosts thousands and thousands of internet

1561
01:58:07,340 --> 01:58:12,180
radio oh they're playing with my erotic poetry

1562
01:58:12,180 --> 01:58:18,180
So, I'm going to go around this time and get everyone's final thoughts.

1563
01:58:18,180 --> 01:58:22,180
Read the erotic poetry first.

1564
01:58:22,180 --> 01:58:29,180
So, Jamie has written, your vagina breath blows.

1565
01:58:29,180 --> 01:58:34,180
I have written, you suck enormous cock.

1566
01:58:34,180 --> 01:58:37,180
And now we're waiting for Jamie to do another one.

1567
01:58:37,180 --> 01:58:40,180
My girlfriend wrote, and this is, let me, um, this,

1568
01:58:40,180 --> 01:58:44,980
a dirty dog's, um, hey, what happened?

1569
01:58:44,980 --> 01:58:48,980
He took a nervous ca- okay, a dirty dog's a nervous cock plunged into my ass.

1570
01:58:48,980 --> 01:58:52,180
I swallowed his wiggling shaft, smeared-

1571
01:58:52,180 --> 01:58:53,680
He took some more words out of there!

1572
01:58:53,680 --> 01:58:57,180
And smeared his pudding on my pink pussy.

1573
01:58:57,180 --> 01:58:59,180
You're, you're a vagina plus.

1574
01:58:59,180 --> 01:59:04,480
Okay, that doesn't make any sense now, because there's stuff being removed.

1575
01:59:04,480 --> 01:59:06,760
Then I put velvet jelly love juice.

1576
01:59:09,760 --> 01:59:12,800
All right, let's get final thoughts.

1577
01:59:12,800 --> 01:59:15,880
We're going to start today with, let's start.

1578
01:59:15,880 --> 01:59:17,680
I'll start final thoughts with Andrew.

1579
01:59:20,680 --> 01:59:24,200
You don't pay me enough to think.

1580
01:59:24,200 --> 01:59:26,280
Shane, thank you so much for being here tonight.

1581
01:59:26,280 --> 01:59:29,520
And I'm sorry that Comcast sucks a big fat cock.

1582
01:59:29,520 --> 01:59:31,240
Yeah, I meant to give them a nephew just

1583
01:59:31,240 --> 01:59:33,520
to be cool like everybody else, but I forgot.

1584
01:59:33,520 --> 01:59:34,520
But thank you for being here.

1585
01:59:34,520 --> 01:59:35,520
Oh, thank you.

1586
01:59:35,520 --> 01:59:36,520
And I hope you had fun anyway.

1587
01:59:36,520 --> 01:59:37,520
I did.

1588
01:59:37,520 --> 01:59:38,520
Good.

1589
01:59:38,520 --> 01:59:39,520
We enjoyed Dance Summit, by the way.

1590
01:59:39,520 --> 01:59:40,520
It was fun.

1591
01:59:40,520 --> 01:59:41,520
Yeah, it's cool.

1592
01:59:41,520 --> 01:59:42,520
So, we'll see you.

1593
01:59:42,520 --> 01:59:46,520
It sounds like we may see you on Wednesday here for the Max 2 show, anyway.

1594
01:59:46,520 --> 01:59:49,520
Yeah, since I won't be in San Fran anymore.

1595
01:59:49,520 --> 01:59:50,520
Just cry.

1596
01:59:50,520 --> 01:59:51,520
Sadness.

1597
01:59:51,520 --> 01:59:52,520
Can you come over for vanilla sky if you want tomorrow?

1598
01:59:52,520 --> 01:59:53,520
Okay, yeah.

1599
01:59:53,520 --> 01:59:54,520
I'll have nothing better to do.

1600
01:59:54,520 --> 01:59:55,520
All right, we'll see.

1601
01:59:55,520 --> 01:59:56,520
We'll get somewhere.

1602
01:59:56,520 --> 01:59:57,520
Hopefully I can do that show.

1603
01:59:57,520 --> 01:59:58,520
We'll see.

1604
01:59:58,520 --> 02:00:01,520
Joey, thanks for being here again.

1605
02:00:01,520 --> 02:00:02,520
No problem.

1606
02:00:02,520 --> 02:00:03,520
Final thought?

1607
02:00:03,520 --> 02:00:04,520
Not really.

1608
02:00:04,520 --> 02:00:07,520
Congratulations on the three-footer once again, then.

1609
02:00:07,520 --> 02:00:08,520
Thank you.

1610
02:00:08,520 --> 02:00:09,520
That means, you know what?

1611
02:00:09,520 --> 02:00:12,520
If you keep at this pace, next week will be six-footers.

1612
02:00:12,520 --> 02:00:13,520
In three weeks, you'll have the Caddos down.

1613
02:00:13,520 --> 02:00:14,520
You'll be just like us.

1614
02:00:14,520 --> 02:00:15,520
Just like that.

1615
02:00:15,520 --> 02:00:21,520
I don't think I can work that magic, but I'll still try.

1616
02:00:21,520 --> 02:00:27,520
Poppy, sorry I drive out here all the way from Davis for an under par show, but they're

1617
02:00:27,520 --> 02:00:29,520
always interesting, aren't they?

1618
02:00:29,520 --> 02:00:30,520
Yeah.

1619
02:00:30,520 --> 02:00:34,160
At least I can actually know what's going on instead of having to sit at my computer

1620
02:00:34,160 --> 02:00:37,480
listening to a live station like no one else.

1621
02:00:37,480 --> 02:00:41,480
This damn signal thing annoys me.

1622
02:00:41,480 --> 02:00:47,920
Alright, Erin thanks for coming.

1623
02:00:47,920 --> 02:00:53,680
Sorry Erin that your first show had to be kind of a weird one, but you can thank Comcast

1624
02:00:53,680 --> 02:00:54,680
for that.

1625
02:00:54,680 --> 02:00:55,680
It's cool.

1626
02:00:55,680 --> 02:00:56,680
But I have a feeling you'll be back.

1627
02:00:56,680 --> 02:00:57,680
Miss Puppy.

1628
02:00:57,680 --> 02:00:58,680
Good.

1629
02:00:58,680 --> 02:00:59,680
Good, I'm glad to hear it.

1630
02:00:59,680 --> 02:01:03,680
Actually, I forgot to add one last FU. I kind of thought of it right now.

1631
02:01:03,680 --> 02:01:04,680
Oh, what the hell. Go for it.

1632
02:01:04,680 --> 02:01:07,680
It was to the scan you went to, was it? Sacramento's?

1633
02:01:07,680 --> 02:01:08,680
Yes.

1634
02:01:08,680 --> 02:01:13,680
Sacramento's for having a fucked up right side pad.

1635
02:01:13,680 --> 02:01:21,680
Because, yeah, on Max 2, I don't know why, but I ended up failing the whistle song maniac.

1636
02:01:21,680 --> 02:01:25,680
How? I don't know.

1637
02:01:25,680 --> 02:01:29,680
and uh... jamie wrote another piece of erotic poetry

1638
02:01:29,680 --> 02:01:35,680
taste her nasty burning crack cream

1639
02:01:35,680 --> 02:01:38,600
i don't want to know but yeah

1640
02:01:38,600 --> 02:01:43,080
so uh... fuck scandia for really fucked up pads

1641
02:01:43,080 --> 02:01:45,400
and stupid teeny boppers

1642
02:01:45,400 --> 02:01:49,360
ghetto quote unquote ghetto people

1643
02:01:49,360 --> 02:01:53,680
and the retards

1644
02:01:53,680 --> 02:01:56,220
And yeah.

1645
02:01:56,220 --> 02:01:59,080
Jamie, your final thought?

1646
02:01:59,080 --> 02:02:01,960
Logie, your final thought?

1647
02:02:01,960 --> 02:02:05,040
My mouth is full of cracker.

1648
02:02:05,040 --> 02:02:08,040
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1649
02:02:08,040 --> 02:02:10,560
My final thought is this.

1650
02:02:10,560 --> 02:02:11,840
We live in America.

1651
02:02:11,840 --> 02:02:15,840
It's about competition, being a capitalist society,

1652
02:02:15,840 --> 02:02:18,600
making money at the expense of other people.

1653
02:02:18,600 --> 02:02:21,680
I beg you, anybody that's out there listening,

1654
02:02:21,680 --> 02:02:25,240
sure west eighty and see what will not eighteen t because that's exactly part

1655
02:02:25,240 --> 02:02:25,960
of congress

1656
02:02:25,960 --> 02:02:29,260
sure west anybody out there that's listening

1657
02:02:29,260 --> 02:02:32,720
build a competitive cable company in this area

1658
02:02:32,720 --> 02:02:34,900
and bring it out there where we live

1659
02:02:34,900 --> 02:02:35,880
win first

1660
02:02:35,880 --> 02:02:38,260
god please any wolf with respect to it

1661
02:02:38,260 --> 02:02:40,020
bird bob i sure as to

1662
02:02:40,020 --> 02:02:44,380
does it always have to keep talking buying each other out accepted if you

1663
02:02:44,380 --> 02:02:48,320
have one first you can't and look at deviant art so don't go to them

1664
02:02:48,320 --> 02:02:52,120
And you might not see it on the webcam, but I just took off my pants.

1665
02:02:52,120 --> 02:02:53,120
Oh, no!

1666
02:02:53,120 --> 02:02:54,120
Why is that?

1667
02:02:54,120 --> 02:02:55,120
Not your pants.

1668
02:02:55,120 --> 02:02:56,120
Why'd you...

1669
02:02:56,120 --> 02:02:57,120
They banned it.

1670
02:02:57,120 --> 02:03:04,120
They blocked anyone with that ISP for actually going in and saving the pictures off their

1671
02:03:04,120 --> 02:03:05,120
site.

1672
02:03:05,120 --> 02:03:06,120
That's assy.

1673
02:03:06,120 --> 02:03:13,160
I beg any other competing cable company out there, please, please come out here and give

1674
02:03:13,160 --> 02:03:15,560
a competitive, give Comcast some competition.

1675
02:03:15,560 --> 02:03:17,160
They have a monopoly on the market.

1676
02:03:17,160 --> 02:03:19,240
This is the problem that we have.

1677
02:03:19,240 --> 02:03:23,040
The reason why this sucks, you guys, I would not put up with this shit, going through live

1678
02:03:23,040 --> 02:03:24,300
65 and Comcast.

1679
02:03:24,300 --> 02:03:25,300
You guys remember...

1680
02:03:25,300 --> 02:03:27,440
It's actually very good in the...

1681
02:03:27,440 --> 02:03:28,600
I'm talking dish.

1682
02:03:28,600 --> 02:03:30,000
You can't get win first out here.

1683
02:03:30,000 --> 02:03:31,480
Oh, this is bad.

1684
02:03:31,480 --> 02:03:32,480
Yeah.

1685
02:03:32,480 --> 02:03:35,040
Because actually, I've used their service at my friend's house and it's really good

1686
02:03:35,040 --> 02:03:36,040
service.

1687
02:03:36,040 --> 02:03:39,800
When, assuming that Loki and I move again in April, which I'm thinking is probably going

1688
02:03:39,800 --> 02:03:43,760
to be the case, I think we're going to go somewhere where we can get DSL instead of

1689
02:03:43,760 --> 02:03:44,760
cable.

1690
02:03:44,760 --> 02:03:45,760
Move closer!

1691
02:03:45,760 --> 02:03:46,760
Yes!

1692
02:03:46,760 --> 02:03:47,760
We'll see.

1693
02:03:47,760 --> 02:03:48,760
We'll see.

1694
02:03:48,760 --> 02:03:49,760
Or buy me gas.

1695
02:03:49,760 --> 02:03:50,760
We'll see.

1696
02:03:50,760 --> 02:03:51,760
Or build a teleporter.

1697
02:03:51,760 --> 02:03:52,760
What, Joey?

1698
02:03:52,760 --> 02:03:53,760
We don't need to talk about it.

1699
02:03:53,760 --> 02:03:54,760
You can't get SPC-DSL.

1700
02:03:54,760 --> 02:03:55,760
DSL is not supported up here.

1701
02:03:55,760 --> 02:03:56,760
Because we live out in Illinois.

1702
02:03:56,760 --> 02:03:57,760
All right, I'm done.

1703
02:03:57,760 --> 02:03:58,760
That's it.

1704
02:03:58,760 --> 02:04:05,440
I just beg somebody to compete with Comcast, please.

1705
02:04:05,440 --> 02:04:06,640
I need another option.

1706
02:04:06,640 --> 02:04:09,760
I don't like this monopoly they have on the market on high-speed Internet.

1707
02:04:09,760 --> 02:04:10,760
Loki.

1708
02:04:10,760 --> 02:04:11,760
What?

1709
02:04:11,760 --> 02:04:12,760
Final thought.

1710
02:04:12,760 --> 02:04:13,760
Oh, I have to contribute, actually.

1711
02:04:13,760 --> 02:04:14,760
Oh, I had a final thought.

1712
02:04:14,760 --> 02:04:15,760
Loki.

1713
02:04:15,760 --> 02:04:17,760
I thought you were going to gauge your final thoughts.

1714
02:04:17,760 --> 02:04:18,760
What?

1715
02:04:18,760 --> 02:04:20,760
Here's my contribution to your cabinet.

1716
02:04:20,760 --> 02:04:23,760
Whoo!

1717
02:04:23,760 --> 02:04:25,760
I got more change.

1718
02:04:25,760 --> 02:04:28,760
We could.

1719
02:04:28,760 --> 02:04:31,760
I want my coin to be the first one in the coin slot.

1720
02:04:31,760 --> 02:04:34,760
Sorry, I already put one in there.

1721
02:04:34,760 --> 02:04:36,760
It could be the donation box.

1722
02:04:36,760 --> 02:04:38,760
That's what it is.

1723
02:04:38,760 --> 02:04:40,760
For kind donations.

1724
02:04:40,760 --> 02:04:42,760
Money for me.

1725
02:04:42,760 --> 02:04:44,760
No, my final thought is...

1726
02:04:44,760 --> 02:04:50,600
Why does the sun have to be so hot?

1727
02:04:50,600 --> 02:04:51,600
Because it is.

1728
02:04:51,600 --> 02:04:52,600
I don't know.

1729
02:04:52,600 --> 02:04:55,080
It's because it's a big nuclear tank.

1730
02:04:55,080 --> 02:04:59,720
What do you get when you cross a bungee cord with an owl?

1731
02:04:59,720 --> 02:05:01,720
My ass.

1732
02:05:01,720 --> 02:05:05,800
Alright, final word of the show.

1733
02:05:05,800 --> 02:05:10,200
I'm going to give it to Shane because for God's sake she came how far out here?

1734
02:05:10,200 --> 02:05:11,760
I didn't give my final thought.

1735
02:05:11,760 --> 02:05:12,760
You did, didn't you?

1736
02:05:12,760 --> 02:05:18,360
general thought is my foot repeatedly kicking your butt and I'm done. Oh, by the way, in

1737
02:05:18,360 --> 02:05:24,120
regards to my F.U. of the week, again, I'm not really pissed off at that site. I'm pissed

1738
02:05:24,120 --> 02:05:29,200
off at that person. And I freaking hate people who abuse their power, so I hope that he catches

1739
02:05:29,200 --> 02:05:30,200
stars of the genitals.

1740
02:05:30,200 --> 02:05:37,000
Oh, I just want to say another F.U. to people that play this game. I know something you

1741
02:05:37,000 --> 02:05:42,160
don't know. I know something you don't know. I fucking hate that shit. I know something

1742
02:05:42,160 --> 02:05:45,840
you don't know, I know something you don't know.

1743
02:05:45,840 --> 02:05:47,920
I probably know lots of things y'all don't know.

1744
02:05:47,920 --> 02:05:51,760
But see, it's one thing to know it and keep it a secret

1745
02:05:51,760 --> 02:05:53,720
that you know it, but it's another thing.

1746
02:05:53,720 --> 02:05:58,480
I'm never telling you what the quadratic formula is, never.

1747
02:05:58,480 --> 02:06:02,240
It's another thing to be all like openly admitting you

1748
02:06:02,240 --> 02:06:03,980
know shit and you're just being a dick

1749
02:06:03,980 --> 02:06:05,900
and not wanting to share it for whatever reason.

1750
02:06:05,900 --> 02:06:08,240
I know what the antidote is.

1751
02:06:08,240 --> 02:06:09,760
For your mental retardation?

1752
02:06:09,760 --> 02:06:11,800
No.

1753
02:06:11,800 --> 02:06:13,800
He go nasty, he get nasty.

1754
02:06:13,800 --> 02:06:15,800
You really know what happen if you take the other pill?

1755
02:06:17,800 --> 02:06:19,800
The birth control pill?

1756
02:06:19,800 --> 02:06:21,800
I don't know, do you know something about that?

1757
02:06:21,800 --> 02:06:23,800
Nope.

1758
02:06:23,800 --> 02:06:24,800
It cures acne.

1759
02:06:24,800 --> 02:06:25,800
It cures acne?

1760
02:06:25,800 --> 02:06:26,800
Listen, really? I didn't do that.

1761
02:06:26,800 --> 02:06:28,800
Actually, my acne, when I...

1762
02:06:28,800 --> 02:06:29,800
Move your hand.

1763
02:06:29,800 --> 02:06:31,800
I...

1764
02:06:33,800 --> 02:06:35,800
Move your hand, don't take it off.

1765
02:06:35,800 --> 02:06:38,800
I have to say this, I was on birth control for a little while.

1766
02:06:38,800 --> 02:06:42,800
It made me an insane psycho bitch, but I had really good skin.

1767
02:06:42,800 --> 02:06:46,800
There you go.

1768
02:06:46,800 --> 02:06:51,800
If you take the red pill, I'll show you how deep this hole goes.

1769
02:06:51,800 --> 02:06:56,800
If you take the blue pill, I'll give you an erection.

1770
02:06:56,800 --> 02:07:00,800
Right, anyway.

1771
02:07:00,800 --> 02:07:01,800
Wait, hold on.

1772
02:07:01,800 --> 02:07:05,800
No, we can't have final word yet because I don't have the end of the show queued up.

1773
02:07:05,800 --> 02:07:06,800
Good job.

1774
02:07:06,800 --> 02:07:07,800
I'm with it today.

1775
02:07:07,800 --> 02:07:12,200
I'm just writing this show off, you guys, you know how like big companies when they

1776
02:07:12,200 --> 02:07:17,320
discover like million dollar debts they have and stuff, they just write it off?

1777
02:07:17,320 --> 02:07:18,320
Enron?

1778
02:07:18,320 --> 02:07:19,320
Yeah.

1779
02:07:19,320 --> 02:07:21,200
I think you guys were just writing tonight off.

1780
02:07:21,200 --> 02:07:24,600
This one needs to be like the lost episode.

1781
02:07:24,600 --> 02:07:25,600
Seriously.

1782
02:07:25,600 --> 02:07:29,320
This is one of the other lost episodes.

1783
02:07:29,320 --> 02:07:31,960
Jamie Dubbs is the lost episode.

1784
02:07:31,960 --> 02:07:42,480
was lost in the void, the big hole, cavernous vagina that is Comcast. Unfortunately, the

1785
02:07:42,480 --> 02:07:48,320
end of this show was lost on its way overseas, but it was finished by the Korean recording

1786
02:07:48,320 --> 02:07:54,680
artists. Hope you enjoy. For those keeping score at home, I just showed another dropout

1787
02:07:54,680 --> 02:08:01,680
on live 365 that's 36 dropouts tonight you guys during the show we drop 36 times we really

1788
02:08:02,880 --> 02:08:09,880
need one more for that one more drop one more drop come on come on motherfucker let me let

1789
02:08:10,920 --> 02:08:14,920
me like bog down computer resources come on get it to drop again come on we need 37 we

1790
02:08:14,920 --> 02:08:21,920
need 37 in a row come on come on Aaron has something to say you know I really wonder

1791
02:08:21,920 --> 02:08:29,920
You know, I really wonder if we'll ever find a cock large enough to rape Comcast and be asked for everything they've done to us tonight.

1792
02:08:29,920 --> 02:08:32,920
I don't know, but I'd be willing to try.

1793
02:08:32,920 --> 02:08:35,920
Yes, big steel-dizzle up here.

1794
02:08:35,920 --> 02:08:38,920
I'm sorry, I don't think you're large enough.

1795
02:08:38,920 --> 02:08:43,920
I think it would have to be, like, a collective cock.

1796
02:08:43,920 --> 02:08:48,920
You know, that's like one cock together.

1797
02:08:48,920 --> 02:08:54,920
I think the cock has to be at least large enough so that in proportion to testicles should be about as large as bean bag chairs.

1798
02:08:54,920 --> 02:09:04,920
We could get Paul and Terry and give it a try.

1799
02:09:04,920 --> 02:09:11,920
Okay, Rod's over here dragging us. 37 in a row.

1800
02:09:11,920 --> 02:09:14,920
37 drop. Quick, end the show. Shane, final word.

1801
02:09:14,920 --> 02:09:17,920
Comcast.

1802
02:09:17,920 --> 02:09:30,920
You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio. Orange Lounge Radio is hosted by Dark Sakura, Skye and Loki. We expect you a nice play again. And now, here's your fortune cookie message of the day.

1803
02:09:30,920 --> 02:09:35,920
Don't play you hate on me. Play you hate somebody else.

1804
02:09:35,920 --> 02:09:48,920
Yo. Yo, yo. I'm a gangster. Where my dogs at? Bark with me if you're my dog. Yo, yo, yo. I'm going to give a shout out to all the player haters.

1805
02:09:48,920 --> 02:09:49,920
I don't like player haters.

1806
02:09:49,920 --> 02:09:51,920
If you're a player hater, don't player hate on me.

1807
02:09:51,920 --> 02:09:52,920
Player hate somewhere else.

1808
02:09:52,920 --> 02:09:55,920
I'm a gangster. I'm straight up.

1809
02:09:57,920 --> 02:09:59,920
Straight up a gangster, dude.

1810
02:09:59,920 --> 02:10:14,480
I'm a gangster, I'm a straight-up G. The gangster life is the life for me. Shooting people by

1811
02:10:14,480 --> 02:10:20,880
day, selling drugs by night. Being a gangster is hella tight. I walk around town with a

1812
02:10:20,880 --> 02:10:26,760
stark erection, then gave your mom a yeast infection. I saw the policeman and I punched

1813
02:10:26,760 --> 02:10:29,760
To serve and protect? What a lie!

1814
02:10:29,760 --> 02:10:32,760
I also don't like white people, you shouldn't too

1815
02:10:32,760 --> 02:10:35,760
And don't get me started about the Jews

1816
02:10:35,760 --> 02:10:38,760
I'm a gangster, grrr I'm mad

1817
02:10:38,760 --> 02:10:40,760
I'm a gangster, my rhymes are bad

1818
02:10:40,760 --> 02:10:43,760
I'm a gangster, I'm iced out like a freezer

1819
02:10:43,760 --> 02:10:46,760
I'm a gangster, I don't listen to Weezer

1820
02:10:46,760 --> 02:10:49,760
I dropped out of school at the age of three

1821
02:10:49,760 --> 02:10:49,760
Why?

1822
02:10:49,760 --> 02:10:51,760
Cause all the teachers tried to play your hate on me

1823
02:10:51,760 --> 02:10:52,760
Oh

1824
02:10:52,760 --> 02:10:55,760
My rhymes are cool, just like doing cocaine

1825
02:10:55,760 --> 02:10:58,760
My rhymes are hot, like a burning flame

1826
02:10:58,760 --> 02:11:00,760
Cisco is my homie, he's a gangster too

1827
02:11:00,760 --> 02:11:03,760
Me and Cisco are the leaders of the gangster crew

1828
02:11:03,760 --> 02:11:06,760
I like to be in jail and he likes to sing and dance

1829
02:11:06,760 --> 02:11:09,760
Some say we're the perfect match

1830
02:11:09,760 --> 02:11:13,760
Step off, step back, step away

1831
02:11:13,760 --> 02:11:18,760
Step back, don't step forward

1832
02:11:18,760 --> 02:11:20,760
Step back, don't step forward

1833
02:11:20,760 --> 02:11:23,760
Step backwards, backwards, don't step at me

1834
02:11:23,760 --> 02:11:29,400
I'm giving a shout out to my homies in cell block 8

1835
02:11:29,400 --> 02:11:32,320
Being in jail sucks cause you always have to masturbate

1836
02:11:32,320 --> 02:11:35,080
Except when a Jewish person goes to jail, all my homies cheer

1837
02:11:35,080 --> 02:11:40,440
They will make mincemeat out of his rear Ben Petty helped me make the gangster beats

1838
02:11:40,440 --> 02:11:42,960
in a song I shot him in the face cause he looked at

1839
02:11:42,960 --> 02:11:44,920
me wrong I'm a gangster

1840
02:11:44,920 --> 02:11:47,920
I drop bombs like Hiroshima I'm a gangster

1841
02:11:47,920 --> 02:11:50,800
Bitch suck on my wiener I'm a gangster

1842
02:11:50,800 --> 02:11:56,360
I drive a cool car, I'm a gangster, I smoke weed in a cigar, yo!

1843
02:11:56,360 --> 02:11:58,360
My gangster flow, yo!

1844
02:11:58,360 --> 02:12:01,360
Yo, yo, yo!

1845
02:12:01,360 --> 02:12:02,360
Yo!

1846
02:12:02,360 --> 02:12:03,360
Yo!

1847
02:12:03,360 --> 02:12:04,360
Yo!

1848
02:12:04,360 --> 02:12:05,360
Yo!

1849
02:12:05,360 --> 02:12:11,360
I'm rolling on dubs, ice out like hockey, I got kicked out of Japan for drinking all

1850
02:12:11,360 --> 02:12:17,360
the sake, fuck a bitch, give me head, hoe, what's up to my dogs, yo, yo, yo!

1851
02:12:17,360 --> 02:12:20,360
They're playing a song on the radio all day long

1852
02:12:20,360 --> 02:12:23,360
So everyone can hear my gangster song

1853
02:12:23,360 --> 02:12:26,360
Nobody thought I'd blow up like a firestone tire

1854
02:12:26,360 --> 02:12:28,360
Oh, there's no beat left

1855
02:12:29,360 --> 02:12:33,360
Die! Die, Santa Claus, die!

1856
02:12:34,360 --> 02:12:36,360
No, I don't want to do acapella

1857
02:12:37,360 --> 02:12:39,360
I like to slap bitches

1858
02:12:39,360 --> 02:12:41,360
I like to slap hoes

1859
02:12:41,360 --> 02:12:45,760
Thanks for listening, and we'll see you next week.
