1
00:00:08,581 --> 00:00:12,727
[SPEAKER_02]: Toto, I have a feeling we're not in Kansas anymore.

2
00:00:16,368 --> 00:00:21,230
[SPEAKER_00]: You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio, the Monty Talk and then some.

3
00:00:21,931 --> 00:00:24,632
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, mostly the and then some part of that.

4
00:00:24,992 --> 00:00:29,014
[SPEAKER_00]: Orange Lounge Radio is created by a bunch of potty-mouthed adults.

5
00:00:29,655 --> 00:00:34,417
[SPEAKER_00]: Orange Lounge may contain sexual, perverted, and mildly retarded content.

6
00:00:35,017 --> 00:00:38,739
[SPEAKER_00]: You probably shouldn't let your children listen to Orange Lounge Radio.

7
00:00:39,059 --> 00:00:40,540
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I will spank your child.

8
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:42,661
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're not going to do your job, goddammit, I will.

9
00:00:47,455 --> 00:00:49,516
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, here's to my big opening.

10
00:00:50,016 --> 00:00:51,156
[SPEAKER_09]: A sphincter says what?

11
00:00:51,436 --> 00:00:53,457
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm super, thanks for asking.

12
00:00:53,817 --> 00:00:56,418
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, you little bitch troll from hell.

13
00:00:56,438 --> 00:00:59,699
[SPEAKER_01]: What am I doing here?

14
00:00:59,739 --> 00:01:00,019
[SPEAKER_13]: No.

15
00:01:00,279 --> 00:01:01,640
[SPEAKER_05]: Dodge this.

16
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:03,961
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a tasty burger.

17
00:01:04,181 --> 00:01:06,662
[SPEAKER_13]: Look, you stupid bastard, you've got no arms left.

18
00:01:06,862 --> 00:01:07,522
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, I have.

19
00:01:07,962 --> 00:01:09,763
[SPEAKER_13]: Look, there's a flesh wound.

20
00:01:09,963 --> 00:01:16,025
[SPEAKER_02]: Searching for a boy in high school is as useless as searching for meaning in a polyshorum.

21
00:01:17,162 --> 00:01:17,902
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah?

22
00:01:18,123 --> 00:01:21,424
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I hope your babies look like monkeys.

23
00:01:21,644 --> 00:01:22,725
[SPEAKER_00]: DarkSakura.

24
00:01:22,905 --> 00:01:23,685
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a sniff.

25
00:01:24,065 --> 00:01:24,606
[SPEAKER_00]: Skye.

26
00:01:24,706 --> 00:01:26,787
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm playing it for the bartender, so suffer.

27
00:01:27,167 --> 00:01:27,687
[SPEAKER_00]: Loki.

28
00:01:27,947 --> 00:01:28,948
[SPEAKER_00]: I hate you!

29
00:01:29,368 --> 00:01:31,409
[SPEAKER_00]: Orange Lounge Radio.

30
00:01:33,430 --> 00:01:36,191
[SPEAKER_07]: We are live, finally.

31
00:01:37,592 --> 00:01:38,492
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is episode number 61.

32
00:01:40,598 --> 00:01:41,879
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, at least a fraction of it.

33
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:45,142
[SPEAKER_07]: The first 20 minutes is gone forever, but that's okay, we didn't do them.

34
00:01:46,404 --> 00:01:53,350
[SPEAKER_07]: For September the 21st of 2003, you're tuned into the Bomani Scene's most Comcast-hating radio station of all things B-Money.

35
00:01:54,271 --> 00:01:56,113
[SPEAKER_07]: My name is Rob Roberts, but you might know me as Sky.

36
00:01:56,574 --> 00:01:58,355
[SPEAKER_07]: Joining me as always are my awesome co-hosts.

37
00:01:58,415 --> 00:02:01,018
[SPEAKER_07]: In this corner, the happiest bunny on the farm is Jamie Summers.

38
00:02:01,038 --> 00:02:02,279
[SPEAKER_07]: You know her better as Dark Sakura.

39
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:03,701
[SPEAKER_03]: Get that thing out of my face.

40
00:02:05,279 --> 00:02:07,260
[SPEAKER_07]: She's too busy playing Dance Summit right now.

41
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:10,081
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, um, you know, we have other things going on, like the show.

42
00:02:10,162 --> 00:02:11,202
[SPEAKER_07]: That's more important.

43
00:02:11,722 --> 00:02:12,823
[SPEAKER_07]: The game will have to come later.

44
00:02:14,083 --> 00:02:16,125
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, in that corner, it's Mother.

45
00:02:16,225 --> 00:02:17,945
[SPEAKER_07]: Say hello to her tech, Master Loki.

46
00:02:19,006 --> 00:02:19,726
[SPEAKER_07]: Hello!

47
00:02:19,746 --> 00:02:22,948
[SPEAKER_07]: You chance her up late playing that damn game.

48
00:02:22,968 --> 00:02:24,629
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, we had to do something without a show.

49
00:02:27,489 --> 00:02:28,669
[SPEAKER_07]: Why is it snowing indoors?

50
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:30,150
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, it's not outdoors.

51
00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:31,010
[SPEAKER_07]: Why is it snowing?

52
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:31,610
[SPEAKER_07]: It's petals.

53
00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:33,311
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, God, I thought you were talking about real life.

54
00:02:33,371 --> 00:02:34,311
[SPEAKER_07]: I was like, what the hell?

55
00:02:34,431 --> 00:02:35,551
[SPEAKER_07]: Is the ceiling caving in?

56
00:02:36,412 --> 00:02:38,092
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, Rob, it's snowing outside.

57
00:02:38,132 --> 00:02:40,253
[SPEAKER_07]: That, you know, special 100 degrees snow.

58
00:02:42,114 --> 00:02:43,074
[SPEAKER_07]: We know.

59
00:02:43,874 --> 00:02:44,914
[SPEAKER_07]: Turn it off.

60
00:02:46,635 --> 00:02:48,756
[SPEAKER_07]: No, you didn't want to talk when you had the mic.

61
00:02:48,916 --> 00:02:49,716
[SPEAKER_07]: So, meh.

68
00:03:22,805 --> 00:03:25,386
[SPEAKER_07]: It's taking us a minute to kind of get back in the groove here.

69
00:03:25,487 --> 00:03:26,187
[SPEAKER_07]: Trying to do the show.

[SPEAKER_07]: When's your first movie coming out?

91
00:04:29,247 --> 00:04:33,130
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just kidding It's not going to happen with me, don't worry I already went clubbing, so yeah

92
00:04:34,254 --> 00:04:34,935
[SPEAKER_07]: Ah, you went clubbing.

93
00:04:34,955 --> 00:04:38,077
[SPEAKER_07]: Where'd you go?

94
00:04:38,117 --> 00:04:47,203
[SPEAKER_03]: We went with Randy, Yellow Jacket Boy, also known as DJ Taka on the boards, or Taka Shonen, as you guys might know him on Calibumani.

95
00:04:48,084 --> 00:04:53,848

[SPEAKER_07]: Wow.

00:04:56,450 --> 00:04:56,870
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

98
00:04:57,531 --> 00:05:00,112
[SPEAKER_03]: Apparently clubbing is a place where everyone's either drunk or high.

99
00:05:01,413 --> 00:05:02,074
[SPEAKER_07]: Not when I go.

100
00:05:02,194 --> 00:05:02,934
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, drunk maybe.

101
00:05:04,648 --> 00:05:05,469
[SPEAKER_07]: I get drunk a lot.

102
00:05:05,569 --> 00:05:06,249
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't get high.

103
00:05:06,309 --> 00:05:06,869
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't do that.

104
00:05:07,429 --> 00:05:08,470
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't endorse weed.

105
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:12,371
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, drunk on the other hand, that's different.

106
00:05:12,771 --> 00:05:14,312
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, drunk on the other hand, completely different story.

107
00:05:16,252 --> 00:05:20,114
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, I'm noticing we're still having some connection stability issues.

108
00:05:20,194 --> 00:05:23,795
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, our chat room's running fine, but the station seems to be having...

109
00:05:25,071 --> 00:05:25,851
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for watching!

110
00:05:44,718 --> 00:06:12,120
[SPEAKER_07]: California, Oregon, Washington all had an outage on Comcast so we all went down for about 10 minutes but for some reason some areas went down for an hour and we were one of those lucky areas so anyway bear with us the show will be played back in its entirety on Wednesday and Thursday of course the webcam is also being switched over to one minute refresh because of the traffic on the net right now because of this Comcast outage so I'm switching it over to one minute refresh

111
00:06:13,553 --> 00:06:18,175
[SPEAKER_07]: I think the buffer, introduce yourself one more time, dear, because I think the buffer hit right when you were introducing yourself.

112
00:06:19,415 --> 00:06:21,316
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello, it's VHG.

113
00:06:22,036 --> 00:06:23,236
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, okay.

114
00:06:23,376 --> 00:06:24,917
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi.

115
00:06:25,077 --> 00:06:25,417
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

116
00:06:28,658 --> 00:06:29,858
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you need to let out a burp, Jamie?

117
00:06:29,958 --> 00:06:30,599
[SPEAKER_07]: Just let it out.

118
00:06:30,899 --> 00:06:31,599
[SPEAKER_07]: Let it out, girl.

119
00:06:32,919 --> 00:06:34,720
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to exercise the burp.

120
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:38,601
[SPEAKER_13]: My burp is stuck in my esophagus.

121
00:06:39,641 --> 00:06:41,042
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, pat her on the back like a baby.

122
00:06:42,688 --> 00:06:49,411
[SPEAKER_05]: I couldn't help because it's like my throat is coated in Pepsi vanilla.

123
00:07:10,779 --> 00:07:12,300
[SPEAKER_07]: You're like a gassy baby right now.

124
00:07:14,862 --> 00:07:23,107
[SPEAKER_03]: I knew you were full of hot gas, but... I cannot put that in my hair.

125
00:07:24,608 --> 00:07:24,868
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

126
00:07:26,449 --> 00:07:28,130
[SPEAKER_07]: VHG, do not give her the whip.

127
00:07:28,170 --> 00:07:28,791
[SPEAKER_07]: That's bad.

128
00:07:29,311 --> 00:07:30,372
[SPEAKER_07]: She doesn't need the whip.

129
00:07:31,152 --> 00:07:32,453
[SPEAKER_07]: We still have more people to introduce.

130
00:07:32,673 --> 00:07:36,196
[SPEAKER_07]: We have a guy here from halfway across America we haven't even said hello to yet.

131
00:07:36,276 --> 00:07:37,196
[SPEAKER_07]: So let's get over here.

132
00:07:38,437 --> 00:07:39,458
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's go around the couch here.

133
00:07:40,313 --> 00:07:40,894
[SPEAKER_07]: Say hello.

134
00:07:42,555 --> 00:07:42,955
[SPEAKER_07]: Hello.

135
00:07:43,455 --> 00:07:43,916
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, Joey.

136
00:07:43,956 --> 00:07:44,316
[SPEAKER_07]: How are you?

137
00:07:44,476 --> 00:07:44,796
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm good.

138
00:07:44,836 --> 00:07:45,517
[SPEAKER_07]: You're back!

139
00:07:46,077 --> 00:07:46,598
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm back.

140
00:07:46,638 --> 00:07:50,080
[SPEAKER_07]: Joey played his very first game of DDR today.

141
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:50,601
[SPEAKER_07]: I did.

142
00:07:50,801 --> 00:07:57,446
[SPEAKER_07]: This is exciting that one year into Orange Lounge Radio, we can still find DDR noobs and kind of like follow them along as they're getting into DDR.

143
00:07:57,466 --> 00:07:58,106
[SPEAKER_07]: It's so cute.

144
00:08:01,549 --> 00:08:03,991
[SPEAKER_09]: Dude, Matt built a ferret launcher.

145
00:08:04,011 --> 00:08:04,611
[SPEAKER_09]: That's awesome.

146
00:08:04,631 --> 00:08:07,353
[SPEAKER_09]: You missed it.

147
00:08:07,673 --> 00:08:08,554
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, you booked it?

148
00:08:08,754 --> 00:08:09,515
[SPEAKER_10]: It wasn't that good anyway.

149
00:08:13,953 --> 00:08:14,794
[SPEAKER_07]: The burp of all burps.

150
00:08:15,075 --> 00:08:15,395
[SPEAKER_10]: Ferret.

151
00:08:15,636 --> 00:08:15,956
[SPEAKER_10]: Ferret.

152
00:08:16,337 --> 00:08:17,078
[SPEAKER_10]: I need the ferret.

153
00:08:17,699 --> 00:08:18,800
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

154
00:08:19,221 --> 00:08:19,682
[SPEAKER_10]: I need one.

155
00:08:20,983 --> 00:08:21,885
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see who else is here.

156
00:08:21,905 --> 00:08:22,285
[SPEAKER_07]: There he is.

157
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:25,801
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, baby.

158
00:08:26,261 --> 00:08:27,101
[SPEAKER_07]: Pass it on.

159
00:08:27,942 --> 00:08:28,723
[SPEAKER_07]: And here we go.

160
00:08:29,083 --> 00:08:32,305
[SPEAKER_07]: All the way from Kansas is Shane.

161
00:08:32,705 --> 00:08:33,286
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, Shane.

162
00:08:33,506 --> 00:08:33,986
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, Rob.

163
00:08:34,326 --> 00:08:34,827
[SPEAKER_07]: How are you?

164
00:08:34,947 --> 00:08:35,267
[SPEAKER_07]: Good.

165
00:08:35,747 --> 00:08:37,709
[SPEAKER_07]: And what's your name online for people that might know you?

166
00:08:37,849 --> 00:08:38,970
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, nobody knows me online.

167
00:08:41,491 --> 00:08:42,372
[SPEAKER_07]: I know you online.

168
00:08:42,392 --> 00:08:44,613
[SPEAKER_07]: Then it'd be Zex and Shad.

169
00:08:45,434 --> 00:08:48,216
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you say you posted on some Kansas City board or something?

170
00:08:49,135 --> 00:08:50,496
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, Miklatov.

171
00:08:50,656 --> 00:08:51,477
[SPEAKER_07]: But you posted Shane?

172
00:08:52,197 --> 00:08:53,398
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I posted Miklatov.

173
00:08:53,678 --> 00:08:53,898
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, okay.

174
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:56,199
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, hello and welcome to California.

175
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:56,640
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

176
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,441
[SPEAKER_07]: What brings you to California this week?

177
00:08:58,721 --> 00:09:00,722
[SPEAKER_07]: Family business and to get away from school.

178
00:09:01,282 --> 00:09:01,623
[SPEAKER_07]: Right on.

179
00:09:01,843 --> 00:09:02,243
[SPEAKER_07]: Good deal.

180
00:09:02,603 --> 00:09:04,765
[SPEAKER_07]: And what do you think so far of California?

181
00:09:04,785 --> 00:09:05,905
[SPEAKER_07]: We're a little crazy here, huh?

182
00:09:06,365 --> 00:09:06,986
[SPEAKER_07]: Just a little.

183
00:09:07,046 --> 00:09:08,066
[SPEAKER_07]: The ferrets flying.

184
00:09:09,367 --> 00:09:10,128
[SPEAKER_07]: And the burping.

185
00:09:10,148 --> 00:09:12,609
[SPEAKER_07]: No show for 20 minutes.

186
00:09:15,811 --> 00:09:19,593
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's nice to find Dance Summit, like, people that like it.

187
00:09:19,633 --> 00:09:21,454
[SPEAKER_07]: Dance Summit was pretty cool, I've got to admit.

188
00:09:21,474 --> 00:09:23,956
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what we were kind of filling in our downtime with, so that was fun.

189
00:09:24,636 --> 00:09:26,537
[SPEAKER_07]: So, a big hello to you, thank you for being here.

190
00:09:26,657 --> 00:09:27,057
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

191
00:09:27,117 --> 00:09:33,181
[SPEAKER_07]: This is neat, because just like, what, two weeks ago we had John Fields here all the way from, like, way back east, Connecticut.

192
00:09:33,801 --> 00:09:34,101
[SPEAKER_07]: New York.

193
00:09:34,121 --> 00:09:35,042
[SPEAKER_07]: New York.

194
00:09:36,082 --> 00:09:43,486
[SPEAKER_07]: And, um, he came... Yeah, all the way from Connecticut, and now here we have another fan all the way from Kansas.

195
00:09:43,526 --> 00:09:44,527
[SPEAKER_07]: So this is cool, I like this.

196
00:09:46,866 --> 00:09:53,368
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, and of course, in the corner, where the freshman belongs is... 23rd Vegas.

197
00:09:53,388 --> 00:09:55,169
[SPEAKER_06]: Where's my fucking joke book, Rob?

198
00:09:55,669 --> 00:09:56,029
[SPEAKER_06]: Shit.

199
00:10:00,031 --> 00:10:02,532
[SPEAKER_07]: The problem with your joke book is it's only about two pages long.

200
00:10:02,572 --> 00:10:03,192
[SPEAKER_07]: I think I have it.

201
00:10:03,672 --> 00:10:04,852
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just kidding.

202
00:10:05,413 --> 00:10:07,773
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, he did not just go there.

203
00:10:08,854 --> 00:10:11,635
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, Rob, Rob, it's more than two pages long.

204
00:10:11,675 --> 00:10:13,355
[SPEAKER_03]: It's five pages long in 40-point font.

205
00:10:16,443 --> 00:10:16,703
[SPEAKER_07]: Ouch.

206
00:10:18,024 --> 00:10:21,007
[SPEAKER_07]: I knew there was a reason you're always here for witty commentary.

207
00:10:22,428 --> 00:10:22,688
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

208
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:28,733
[SPEAKER_07]: So, okay, everybody calm down for a minute.

209
00:10:29,154 --> 00:10:32,777
[SPEAKER_07]: We've had a little bit of chaos in the beginning of the show here.

210
00:10:33,197 --> 00:10:37,381
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought we'd kick off the show like we usually do, our all favorite game.

211
00:10:38,342 --> 00:10:39,883
[SPEAKER_07]: How was your week and how was your day?

212
00:10:40,223 --> 00:10:44,706
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to play this because of course we have some out of town folks here that probably have a lot they want to say about California.

213
00:10:45,267 --> 00:10:47,168
[SPEAKER_07]: And I certainly have a lot to say.

214
00:10:47,808 --> 00:10:51,190
[SPEAKER_07]: So let's, I actually have Bomani related stories to tell this week too.

215
00:10:51,711 --> 00:10:52,411
[SPEAKER_07]: No way, way.

216
00:10:54,372 --> 00:10:55,913
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're going to start with Jamie.

217
00:10:57,494 --> 00:10:59,015
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi.

218
00:11:01,177 --> 00:11:02,378
[SPEAKER_05]: Wait, wait, hold on, hold on.

219
00:11:02,398 --> 00:11:03,238
[SPEAKER_05]: I got to say it.

220
00:11:05,333 --> 00:11:06,674
[SPEAKER_07]: Bradley gets a total zing.

221
00:11:06,734 --> 00:11:12,939
[SPEAKER_07]: Arcadian42 in the chat room, he says, and 23 Magus' joke book, it's printed on recycled paper, just like the material.

222
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:18,003
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't ye.

223
00:11:19,465 --> 00:11:20,325
[SPEAKER_07]: That was beautiful.

224
00:11:20,826 --> 00:11:21,626
[SPEAKER_03]: That was beautiful.

225
00:11:22,947 --> 00:11:27,551
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I thought that it was recycled, like, you know, like recycled toilet paper.

226
00:11:29,293 --> 00:11:31,955
[SPEAKER_03]: It's written on five sheets of toilet paper.

227
00:11:33,055 --> 00:11:34,056
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, Jamie, how was your day?

228
00:11:34,076 --> 00:11:34,517
[SPEAKER_07]: How was your week?

229
00:11:34,897 --> 00:11:35,698
[SPEAKER_03]: My week sucked.

230
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:40,183
[SPEAKER_03]: I worked, and Dan lives off in Texas.

231
00:11:42,686 --> 00:11:46,050
[SPEAKER_03]: He manages an unnamed video game store.

232
00:11:46,070 --> 00:11:47,292
[SPEAKER_10]: Unnamed?

233
00:11:47,352 --> 00:11:48,313
[SPEAKER_10]: Unnamed.

234
00:11:49,696 --> 00:11:58,220
[SPEAKER_03]: and this unnamed series of video game stores had a conference in an unnamed state named Texas.

235
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:00,181
[SPEAKER_03]: It's named now.

236
00:12:00,921 --> 00:12:02,062
[SPEAKER_03]: You killed the ferret!

237
00:12:03,282 --> 00:12:04,703
[SPEAKER_05]: I killed the ferret.

238
00:12:04,803 --> 00:12:06,264
[SPEAKER_13]: Where'd it go?

239
00:12:06,344 --> 00:12:06,644
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

240
00:12:07,384 --> 00:12:08,425
[SPEAKER_13]: Give me the ferret.

241
00:12:09,045 --> 00:12:09,846
[SPEAKER_13]: Give me my baby.

242
00:12:09,866 --> 00:12:11,526
[SPEAKER_13]: I want this baby.

243
00:12:12,107 --> 00:12:12,787
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't want it now.

244
00:12:15,248 --> 00:12:16,069
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, anyway.

245
00:12:17,276 --> 00:12:23,577
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, um, so I've been really, like, by myself all week, and it sucked.

246
00:12:24,818 --> 00:12:30,059
[SPEAKER_03]: And I played some, played some Phantasy Star.

247
00:12:30,539 --> 00:12:34,900
[SPEAKER_03]: I played some, yeah, my new addiction, sort of, is Phantasy Star Online.

248
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:38,020
[SPEAKER_03]: Which I'm playing on the Xbox.

249
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:41,461
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I gave up playing it on the GameCube.

250
00:12:41,901 --> 00:12:44,762
[SPEAKER_11]: In response to Naoki in the chatroom, yes, you must get Disgaea.

251
00:12:45,482 --> 00:12:46,102
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, you will.

252
00:12:46,622 --> 00:12:46,862
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's...

253
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:50,982
[SPEAKER_09]: Ooh, Jamie, okay, what are we looking at?

254
00:12:51,642 --> 00:12:52,382
[SPEAKER_09]: What are we looking at?

255
00:12:54,204 --> 00:12:55,905
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think I wanna know what's in that jug.

256
00:12:56,345 --> 00:12:59,247
[SPEAKER_13]: They're growing a mutant in this bottle of orange juice.

257
00:13:02,569 --> 00:13:06,552
[SPEAKER_12]: It expired in July, and I got it in the fridge today.

258
00:13:07,953 --> 00:13:08,714
[SPEAKER_07]: Yuck.

259
00:13:08,754 --> 00:13:11,255
[SPEAKER_07]: Might I add, I was about to pour myself a glass.

260
00:13:14,998 --> 00:13:16,759
[SPEAKER_03]: But penicillin is good for you.

261
00:13:16,819 --> 00:13:18,200
[SPEAKER_03]: It's an antibiotic.

262
00:13:18,781 --> 00:13:19,141
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, right.

263
00:13:19,922 --> 00:13:20,782
[SPEAKER_10]: In rare form.

264
00:13:21,943 --> 00:13:23,845
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me shift my position here.

265
00:13:24,545 --> 00:13:25,886
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm still hiding from the webcam.

266
00:13:27,407 --> 00:13:28,888
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, what is that?

267
00:13:33,872 --> 00:13:34,132
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

268
00:13:34,977 --> 00:13:36,698
[SPEAKER_08]: Richie, they do not look like maids.

269
00:13:37,379 --> 00:13:38,019
[SPEAKER_08]: Get over it.

270
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:38,700
[SPEAKER_08]: Please.

271
00:13:42,463 --> 00:13:42,763
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway.

272
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:46,886
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, the Caphras look stupid now, by the way.

273
00:13:47,847 --> 00:13:58,375
[SPEAKER_03]: But anyway, so I played like a whole bunch of Ragnarok online and they implemented the Komodo patch, which I made it there walking with my assassin.

274
00:14:01,806 --> 00:14:05,589
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, with the judicious use of fly wings to teleport.

275
00:14:07,370 --> 00:14:16,618
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I found out that with all the free wharfs, it only cost me like 2,000 zenny to get there with my merchant.

276
00:14:16,738 --> 00:14:22,723
[SPEAKER_03]: So I took my merchant there, bought 60,000 steel arrows, and doubled all of my money.

277
00:14:23,383 --> 00:14:26,606
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I started a guild named Battle Royale on my archer.

278
00:14:28,214 --> 00:14:33,559
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, um, so yeah, my week's been, like, full of gaming, and then full of some really stupid crappy stress.

279
00:14:33,899 --> 00:14:35,801
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't touch a single Bermondi game all weekend.

280
00:14:37,535 --> 00:14:37,875
[SPEAKER_03]: All week.

281
00:14:39,936 --> 00:14:40,516
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

282
00:14:40,556 --> 00:14:44,158
[SPEAKER_07]: The past four weeks we've done this segment, you haven't touched a Bermuda game.

283
00:14:45,278 --> 00:14:45,939
[SPEAKER_03]: I am next week.

284
00:14:46,379 --> 00:14:47,539
[SPEAKER_07]: Max 2 is coming out this week.

285
00:14:47,559 --> 00:14:48,440
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you plan on playing it?

286
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:49,580
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to play it, yeah.

287
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:57,503
[SPEAKER_03]: I've still got the interestingly acquired dance pad at my house.

288
00:14:58,904 --> 00:15:00,865
[SPEAKER_07]: You mean my dance pad?

289
00:15:01,525 --> 00:15:02,886
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been at my house for 30 days.

290
00:15:02,946 --> 00:15:04,246
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, watch it, lady.

291
00:15:04,346 --> 00:15:05,747
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't like where you're going with that.

292
00:15:06,896 --> 00:15:07,337
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm kidding.

293
00:15:07,957 --> 00:15:10,058
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not paying rent either, so evict it already.

294
00:15:10,999 --> 00:15:11,419
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm kidding.

295
00:15:11,879 --> 00:15:13,300
[SPEAKER_03]: You know I give it back when you ask for it.

296
00:15:14,281 --> 00:15:15,322
[SPEAKER_07]: Provided we don't break up.

297
00:15:17,783 --> 00:15:22,106
[SPEAKER_07]: Because that's how I got it in the first place.

298
00:15:22,886 --> 00:15:25,828
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I found out that I'm 69% male on my live show.

299
00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:29,231
[SPEAKER_03]: Which is funny.

300
00:15:32,248 --> 00:15:34,689
[SPEAKER_03]: Excuse me, but I don't have balls to scratch, thank you.

301
00:15:35,749 --> 00:15:36,329
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, then.

302
00:15:38,650 --> 00:15:39,090
[SPEAKER_03]: No!

303
00:15:43,791 --> 00:15:46,392
[SPEAKER_07]: For those in here, Magus, he said, I thought they were on the upper body.

304
00:15:47,753 --> 00:15:48,793
[SPEAKER_07]: Flying carrot!

305
00:15:52,674 --> 00:15:54,414
[SPEAKER_03]: This thing hurts, by the way, when you hit people with it.

306
00:15:55,055 --> 00:15:55,715
[SPEAKER_03]: My, my...

307
00:15:58,524 --> 00:16:04,650
[SPEAKER_03]: I have found out that this thing that I have my hair wrapped up in hurts really hard if you get whapped with it.

308
00:16:05,391 --> 00:16:05,972
[SPEAKER_10]: What about the whip?

309
00:16:06,973 --> 00:16:08,334
[SPEAKER_03]: Whips hurt too, but this hurts more.

310
00:16:08,554 --> 00:16:09,075
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, okay.

311
00:16:09,916 --> 00:16:10,556
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, where's the whip?

312
00:16:15,121 --> 00:16:18,485
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, I downloaded a bunch of crap from my computer.

313
00:16:20,577 --> 00:16:49,720
[SPEAKER_03]: and she's also the most wonderful sister in the world because she's working on darksakura.com and by the way we did some work for roleplay.darksakura.com which should be a few more forms have been added on so everybody has to sign up for it now and then that's it so that was your day and your week Dan came home today

314
00:16:50,731 --> 00:16:51,952
[SPEAKER_07]: And he might be leaving early tonight.

315
00:16:52,532 --> 00:16:52,813
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe.

316
00:16:54,294 --> 00:16:54,634
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe.

317
00:16:54,974 --> 00:16:57,777
[SPEAKER_07]: Because you might have to plan for a long evening.

318
00:16:58,537 --> 00:17:02,000
[SPEAKER_03]: Dan came home tonight, and we're going to go get food, but I ate.

319
00:17:03,501 --> 00:17:07,324
[SPEAKER_03]: I had a salad and blue potato chips, which I'm going to share with everyone.

320
00:17:07,344 --> 00:17:07,945
[SPEAKER_07]: Mmm, yum.

321
00:17:08,605 --> 00:17:09,006
[SPEAKER_03]: Blue.

322
00:17:09,086 --> 00:17:09,966
[SPEAKER_07]: Do they taste like blue?

323
00:17:10,307 --> 00:17:12,128
[SPEAKER_03]: They taste like blue, amazingly enough.

324
00:17:12,608 --> 00:17:12,889
[SPEAKER_07]: Awesome.

325
00:17:13,269 --> 00:17:15,331
[SPEAKER_03]: They taste very rugged, like blue.

326
00:17:15,351 --> 00:17:16,311
[SPEAKER_07]: Rugged and blue.

327
00:17:17,552 --> 00:17:18,193
[SPEAKER_03]: Rugged and blue.

328
00:17:19,315 --> 00:17:23,896
[SPEAKER_07]: Just a reminder, you guys, the chat room is kind of bitching about things going up and down.

329
00:17:24,236 --> 00:17:25,417
[SPEAKER_07]: We're doing the best we can.

330
00:17:26,077 --> 00:17:28,038
[SPEAKER_07]: Address those cards and letters to Comcast.

331
00:17:28,098 --> 00:17:33,819
[SPEAKER_07]: DDArcoholic in the chat room says, Comcast is so freaking unreliable, it should be illegal to run a business the way they do.

332
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:35,140
[SPEAKER_07]: And I tend to agree.

333
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:36,360
[SPEAKER_07]: It's pretty sad.

334
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:38,341
[SPEAKER_07]: It's even worse than Scandia's business.

335
00:17:38,461 --> 00:17:40,141
[SPEAKER_07]: It's worse than Roseville, Golf Land.

336
00:17:42,242 --> 00:17:45,883
[SPEAKER_07]: A moment of silence, like, I can't believe he just went there.

337
00:17:48,383 --> 00:17:51,004
[SPEAKER_11]: I worked at Arcades, I know what's going on.

338
00:17:51,404 --> 00:17:51,705
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway.

339
00:17:53,926 --> 00:17:55,106
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, Loki!

340
00:17:57,207 --> 00:17:58,508
[SPEAKER_07]: How was your week, how was your day?

341
00:18:00,649 --> 00:18:01,309
[SPEAKER_07]: He's doing dishes.

342
00:18:01,329 --> 00:18:02,049
[SPEAKER_07]: Mid-show!

343
00:18:04,190 --> 00:18:09,893
[SPEAKER_11]: Microphone to the... Alright, anyways.

344
00:18:09,913 --> 00:18:14,555
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see, this week was expensive.

345
00:18:15,455 --> 00:18:16,856
[SPEAKER_07]: It involved buying things.

346
00:18:17,892 --> 00:18:19,353
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a lot of wood outside.

347
00:18:22,876 --> 00:18:24,297
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki bought some stiff wood.

348
00:18:26,498 --> 00:18:32,243
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, I bought eight nice sheets of MDF for the arcade cabinet.

349
00:18:33,103 --> 00:18:34,925
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm working on finishing my pads.

350
00:18:34,985 --> 00:18:35,805
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm almost done.

351
00:18:35,865 --> 00:18:38,047
[SPEAKER_07]: I've got one of them almost done.

352
00:18:38,267 --> 00:18:38,567
[SPEAKER_07]: It was...

353
00:18:40,785 --> 00:18:45,186
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm starting the wiring on it, but I, yeah, I haven't gotten around to it.

354
00:18:45,726 --> 00:18:49,847
[SPEAKER_07]: But anyway, starting the wiring on one of the pads, the other pad needs to be done, probably be done this week.

355
00:18:51,487 --> 00:18:54,788
[SPEAKER_07]: Arcade stuff, I'm getting the rest of my buttons pretty soon.

356
00:18:55,748 --> 00:19:01,009
[SPEAKER_07]: I ordered an Atari 2600 trackball, it's going to be hacked into turntables for 2DX.

357
00:19:01,769 --> 00:19:05,070
[SPEAKER_07]: So you're turning an Atari 2600 trackball into a 2DX controller?

358
00:19:05,692 --> 00:19:10,516
[SPEAKER_07]: No, the optical controls for it are going to be for the turntables for 2DX.

359
00:19:11,997 --> 00:19:15,340
[SPEAKER_07]: But then I have these two spinners here.

360
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,361
[SPEAKER_07]: I realize they're pretty useless now.

361
00:19:18,822 --> 00:19:19,243
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

362
00:19:20,243 --> 00:19:21,785
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I can't use them.

363
00:19:24,367 --> 00:19:25,427
[SPEAKER_07]: It's because it's a B-movie.

364
00:19:26,228 --> 00:19:26,768
[SPEAKER_07]: But anyways...

365
00:19:29,318 --> 00:19:37,286
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I bought a bunch of shit, and I spent a lot of money, and now I have to scrimp for like a few weeks, and then, um, what else did I do?

366
00:19:42,190 --> 00:19:43,952
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't even see the screen.

367
00:19:44,753 --> 00:19:46,434
[SPEAKER_07]: It's for the best, Loki, don't worry about it.

368
00:19:49,297 --> 00:19:51,998
[SPEAKER_07]: Our chatroom is bitchy tonight.

369
00:19:52,898 --> 00:19:59,120
[SPEAKER_07]: Man, you robbed them of 20 minutes of Orange Lounge and they're just going, freaking claws out.

370
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:06,542
[SPEAKER_12]: I think Loki's kicking someone from the chatroom.

371
00:20:06,682 --> 00:20:08,043
[SPEAKER_07]: And of course he's under my name.

372
00:20:08,523 --> 00:20:09,963
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, be nice.

373
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:12,124
[SPEAKER_07]: That was under me.

374
00:20:12,164 --> 00:20:13,444
[SPEAKER_07]: You did that under my name.

375
00:20:14,184 --> 00:20:15,045
[SPEAKER_07]: That's so mean.

376
00:20:15,085 --> 00:20:15,985
[SPEAKER_07]: Why did you do that?

377
00:20:17,498 --> 00:20:19,920
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't do it, and Jamie knows it, and she's my witness.

378
00:20:20,961 --> 00:20:22,342
[SPEAKER_03]: I said not to.

379
00:20:22,362 --> 00:20:23,083
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't do it!

380
00:20:24,084 --> 00:20:24,844
[SPEAKER_03]: That's Rob.

381
00:20:26,566 --> 00:20:28,948
[SPEAKER_03]: My God, I said not to do that.

382
00:20:29,689 --> 00:20:31,951
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry, I'm going to kick him.

383
00:20:32,051 --> 00:20:32,871
[SPEAKER_03]: Where's my foot?

384
00:20:35,093 --> 00:20:35,874
[SPEAKER_12]: That's pretty bad.

385
00:20:38,036 --> 00:20:39,157
[SPEAKER_03]: Smell the shoe!

386
00:20:39,957 --> 00:20:40,818
[SPEAKER_07]: Mine smells worse.

387
00:20:40,938 --> 00:20:43,761
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, anyway, so what else did I do this week?

388
00:20:46,025 --> 00:20:47,647
[SPEAKER_07]: Will somebody invite her back, please?

389
00:20:49,988 --> 00:20:51,169
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, go ahead.

390
00:20:51,289 --> 00:20:51,849
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

391
00:20:52,350 --> 00:20:56,252
[SPEAKER_07]: So, um... What else?

392
00:20:56,272 --> 00:20:58,353
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know, I didn't do too much this week.

393
00:20:58,393 --> 00:21:08,620
[SPEAKER_07]: It's pretty much just working on the stupid pads and then, you know, just sitting at my desk, rotting away, and... At one point I was trying to... I didn't know how I was going to hook up the pads to, like, the, um...

394
00:21:22,754 --> 00:21:23,855
[SPEAKER_07]: I know I'm hilarious.

395
00:21:24,015 --> 00:21:28,157
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, if you're not in our chat room tonight, you're missing out.

396
00:21:28,858 --> 00:21:34,782
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry that we're so one-sided, but our chat room is so bitchy tonight.

397
00:21:34,842 --> 00:21:35,582
[SPEAKER_07]: It's beautiful.

398
00:21:35,942 --> 00:21:36,743
[SPEAKER_07]: You must be there.

399
00:21:37,763 --> 00:21:44,588
[SPEAKER_07]: www.callybomani.com Click on Orange Lounge and click on chat.

400
00:21:46,489 --> 00:21:47,249
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, anyways, so...

401
00:21:54,226 --> 00:21:55,026
[SPEAKER_07]: Moving on.

402
00:21:55,827 --> 00:21:56,167
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

403
00:21:57,328 --> 00:21:58,388
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that's pretty much my week.

404
00:21:58,849 --> 00:21:59,129
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

405
00:22:00,710 --> 00:22:02,311
[SPEAKER_07]: Just a lot of nothing.

406
00:22:04,433 --> 00:22:07,995
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, and I found a lot of rotted stuff in our fridge, which I cleaned out.

407
00:22:09,456 --> 00:22:10,056
[SPEAKER_10]: Not bad, huh?

408
00:22:10,837 --> 00:22:11,077
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

409
00:22:11,517 --> 00:22:11,738
[SPEAKER_10]: Hmm.

410
00:22:14,219 --> 00:22:14,560
[SPEAKER_07]: That's it.

411
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:15,720
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm done.

412
00:22:16,221 --> 00:22:16,501
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

413
00:22:17,881 --> 00:22:21,444
[SPEAKER_07]: But then again, you know, if Marin wants me to, I can keep talking all night long.

414
00:22:21,464 --> 00:22:24,506
[SPEAKER_07]: I can never stop.

415
00:22:25,387 --> 00:22:26,748
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll talk about my week and my day.

416
00:22:27,529 --> 00:22:28,049
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, you do that.

417
00:22:28,209 --> 00:22:31,932
[SPEAKER_07]: My week was, there wasn't really a lot to it.

418
00:22:32,032 --> 00:22:34,374
[SPEAKER_07]: Work, sleep, play, you know, type thing, whatever.

419
00:22:35,695 --> 00:22:38,197
[SPEAKER_07]: There was that, and then, but this weekend, this is cool.

420
00:22:38,737 --> 00:22:41,520
[SPEAKER_07]: Yesterday, yesterday I went to Reno.

421
00:22:43,330 --> 00:22:49,303
[SPEAKER_07]: Reno is kind of a shithole in some ways, but I got to gamble, which is fun because I love gambling.

422
00:22:50,426 --> 00:22:50,706
[SPEAKER_07]: I think...

423
00:22:52,458 --> 00:22:54,039
[SPEAKER_07]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

424
00:23:15,393 --> 00:23:16,494
[SPEAKER_07]: I really, really wanted it.

425
00:23:17,255 --> 00:23:18,356
[SPEAKER_07]: That was real wise.

426
00:23:18,436 --> 00:23:18,716
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway.

427
00:23:19,237 --> 00:23:26,604
[SPEAKER_07]: But not only did we gamble, we went around and played some different DDR machines, because, you know, in a town like Vegas or Reno, every casino's got a DDR machine, right?

428
00:23:26,965 --> 00:23:31,429
[SPEAKER_07]: So we went to the El Dorado, and they have, get this, a Solo 4th Plus.

429
00:23:32,710 --> 00:23:33,651
[SPEAKER_07]: Those are so rare.

430
00:23:33,932 --> 00:23:34,933
[SPEAKER_07]: It was godly.

431
00:23:35,093 --> 00:23:36,494
[SPEAKER_07]: I was so happy to play it.

432
00:23:36,574 --> 00:23:37,055
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, like...

433
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:42,733
[SPEAKER_07]: How often do you see a 4th Plus these days, let alone a solo 4th Plus I could play?

434
00:23:42,853 --> 00:23:48,978
[SPEAKER_07]: And you know, you know, I fired that fucker up and I played solo Conga Feelin' first song.

435
00:23:49,979 --> 00:23:51,380
[SPEAKER_07]: Six-panel Conga Feelin'.

436
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:52,721
[SPEAKER_07]: It's awesome.

437
00:23:53,701 --> 00:23:55,302
[SPEAKER_07]: And I did some freestyle, too.

438
00:23:55,322 --> 00:23:55,783
[SPEAKER_07]: That was fun.

439
00:23:55,863 --> 00:23:57,044
[SPEAKER_07]: I went with the Ice Princess.

440
00:23:58,285 --> 00:24:00,126
[SPEAKER_07]: I did some loose freestyle, too.

441
00:24:00,346 --> 00:24:02,147
[SPEAKER_07]: Aaron's ears just perked up when you said that.

442
00:24:02,167 --> 00:24:03,829
[SPEAKER_07]: I did freestyle.

443
00:24:03,849 --> 00:24:03,949
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, I...

444
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:06,560
[SPEAKER_07]: I did some great freestyle.

445
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:08,501
[SPEAKER_07]: I did a freestyle to the 7 jump.

446
00:24:08,901 --> 00:24:10,401
[SPEAKER_07]: I did a freestyle to the 7 jump.

447
00:24:10,521 --> 00:24:10,921
[SPEAKER_07]: It ruled.

448
00:24:15,682 --> 00:24:16,002
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

449
00:24:19,083 --> 00:24:19,523
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I know.

450
00:24:20,783 --> 00:24:22,803
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, I'm not going AZN.

451
00:24:22,843 --> 00:24:24,264
[SPEAKER_07]: I haven't started playing Initial D yet.

452
00:24:27,804 --> 00:24:30,945
[SPEAKER_07]: Nothing flows Initial D. Just everything.

453
00:24:33,464 --> 00:24:36,827
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see, and then, uh, Rito is fourth plus, what else did we play in Rito?

454
00:24:37,107 --> 00:24:49,938
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I got my name on the machine at Circus Circus, because, like, then I made it, like, my goal, like, I had to go put my initials somewhere in every machine that I could find, because, like, I have a big ego or something, and, like, I feel the need to spread my sky germs everywhere.

455
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:52,701
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, heaven forbid.

456
00:24:52,861 --> 00:24:56,904
[SPEAKER_07]: So, anyway, that was pretty much my week, my day in a nutshell.

457
00:24:57,845 --> 00:24:58,386
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, yeah.

458
00:25:00,043 --> 00:25:05,205
[SPEAKER_07]: So if EvilMaliki2DX says he humped that machine, so I humped it too, so we kind of had sex.

459
00:25:08,266 --> 00:25:09,327
[SPEAKER_07]: I hope you wore a condom.

460
00:25:11,648 --> 00:25:12,048
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh boy.

461
00:25:13,428 --> 00:25:20,371
[SPEAKER_07]: I danced to Oh Nick Please Not So Quick too, because to play six panel erotic is just beautiful.

462
00:25:23,032 --> 00:25:23,692
[SPEAKER_07]: Moving on.

463
00:25:23,973 --> 00:25:27,334
[SPEAKER_03]: What was set number two in your five toilet paper sheet joke book?

464
00:25:27,952 --> 00:25:30,393
[SPEAKER_07]: Poppy, how was your day, how was your week?

465
00:25:31,213 --> 00:25:39,815
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, okay, um, this week has been, uh, stuff on campus, looking for a job, and Disgaea.

466
00:25:40,675 --> 00:25:41,355
[SPEAKER_11]: And more Disgaea.

467
00:25:41,835 --> 00:25:42,535
[SPEAKER_11]: And more Disgaea.

468
00:25:43,096 --> 00:25:43,776
[SPEAKER_08]: And more Disgaea.

469
00:25:46,516 --> 00:25:49,817
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I really don't remember anything I did the past week besides play Disgaea.

470
00:25:50,557 --> 00:25:53,358
[SPEAKER_08]: That's, and that's kind of sad, but it's time well spent.

471
00:25:57,814 --> 00:25:58,755
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a really good picture.

472
00:26:00,815 --> 00:26:02,796
[SPEAKER_09]: And none of that caught on the microphone.

473
00:26:05,557 --> 00:26:14,921
[SPEAKER_09]: A game has to be good when you hear some really disturbing jokes about a zombie and a horse wiener.

474
00:26:19,202 --> 00:26:20,823
[SPEAKER_07]: Is this something out of Magus' jokebook?

475
00:26:21,763 --> 00:26:22,003
[SPEAKER_09]: What?

476
00:26:22,063 --> 00:26:22,283
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

477
00:26:22,904 --> 00:26:23,604
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I'm serious.

478
00:26:23,664 --> 00:26:26,025
[SPEAKER_09]: It's actually part of the plot of the game.

479
00:26:28,550 --> 00:26:30,971
[SPEAKER_08]: Your ass is still on the webcam because it hasn't refreshed.

480
00:26:31,011 --> 00:26:32,412
[SPEAKER_08]: Your webcam's checking you out.

481
00:26:38,014 --> 00:26:38,854
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyway, puppy.

482
00:26:40,975 --> 00:26:47,357
[SPEAKER_11]: And then, yeah, besides the fact that I'm now settled into my apartment.

483
00:26:50,479 --> 00:26:51,439
[SPEAKER_05]: What is wrong with you people?

484
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:54,660
[SPEAKER_07]: It's something in the air.

485
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:55,961
[SPEAKER_07]: It's Comcast does it to you.

486
00:26:58,905 --> 00:26:59,686
[SPEAKER_09]: Tag teaming.

487
00:26:59,946 --> 00:27:01,667
[SPEAKER_07]: I feel like I'm in kindergarten again.

488
00:27:03,248 --> 00:27:05,309
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, now we just need some whoopee cushions and we'll be set.

489
00:27:05,330 --> 00:27:07,211
[SPEAKER_07]: I was going to say, I kind of have to fart.

490
00:27:08,492 --> 00:27:09,092
[SPEAKER_07]: Kidding, kidding.

491
00:27:10,293 --> 00:27:10,953
[SPEAKER_07]: Kidding, kidding.

492
00:27:13,335 --> 00:27:17,738
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I have a, what do you call it, a cigarette lighter somewhere though.

493
00:27:20,060 --> 00:27:21,441
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, that was it?

494
00:27:22,602 --> 00:27:22,902
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

495
00:27:24,263 --> 00:27:25,904
[SPEAKER_10]: Joey, do you have anything you want to share about your week and your day?

496
00:27:27,777 --> 00:27:33,561
[SPEAKER_10]: My week was filled of work and work and more work.

497
00:27:34,182 --> 00:27:35,122
[SPEAKER_10]: Kind of boring, huh?

498
00:27:35,723 --> 00:27:36,563
[SPEAKER_10]: But it pays the bills.

499
00:27:38,064 --> 00:27:42,628
[SPEAKER_10]: And let's see, this weekend I was off and didn't do a whole lot, just hung out.

500
00:27:43,768 --> 00:27:49,072
[SPEAKER_10]: And today I played my first game of DDR.

501
00:27:49,232 --> 00:27:50,073
[SPEAKER_10]: Yay!

502
00:27:50,153 --> 00:27:51,114
[SPEAKER_10]: Congratulations!

503
00:27:51,214 --> 00:27:52,435
[SPEAKER_10]: Very first time.

504
00:27:53,896 --> 00:27:54,756
[SPEAKER_10]: And what was it?

505
00:27:55,096 --> 00:27:56,698
[SPEAKER_10]: I passed...

506
00:27:57,418 --> 00:27:58,078
[SPEAKER_10]: A three-step.

507
00:27:58,479 --> 00:27:59,819
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, you passed a three-footer.

508
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:02,861
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a DER lingo, a three-footer.

509
00:28:03,041 --> 00:28:03,682
[SPEAKER_10]: I passed it.

510
00:28:04,122 --> 00:28:05,283
[SPEAKER_10]: That was so cool.

511
00:28:05,463 --> 00:28:06,003
[SPEAKER_10]: First try.

512
00:28:06,363 --> 00:28:08,985
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyway, other than that, that was it.

513
00:28:12,127 --> 00:28:12,567
[SPEAKER_07]: Cool deal.

514
00:28:12,887 --> 00:28:14,888
[SPEAKER_07]: And what was the three-footer you passed, do you remember?

515
00:28:17,930 --> 00:28:20,251
[SPEAKER_10]: Was it... Look.

516
00:28:20,752 --> 00:28:21,452
[SPEAKER_10]: Look into the sky?

517
00:28:21,612 --> 00:28:22,753
[SPEAKER_08]: Look to the sky, you got it.

518
00:28:22,793 --> 00:28:23,493
[SPEAKER_08]: There you go.

519
00:28:24,094 --> 00:28:24,394
[SPEAKER_10]: Good job.

520
00:28:25,216 --> 00:28:25,616
[SPEAKER_08]: to the chatroom.

521
00:28:25,876 --> 00:28:27,997
[SPEAKER_08]: Chaos, this isn't channel DDR Freak.

522
00:28:28,077 --> 00:28:32,878
[SPEAKER_08]: Mom jokes are not welcome here.

523
00:28:33,938 --> 00:28:36,199
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, our chatroom is so feisty tonight.

524
00:28:36,219 --> 00:28:37,179
[SPEAKER_07]: What a bunch of bitches.

525
00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:44,581
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, let's move on.

526
00:28:46,021 --> 00:28:49,982
[SPEAKER_07]: Andrew, Mr. Magus, tell us about your week and your day.

527
00:28:52,361 --> 00:28:58,822
[SPEAKER_06]: My week was full of bombing Japanese quizzes and putting it in locks at the ARC arcade.

528
00:29:00,263 --> 00:29:01,523
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been studying, Jamie.

529
00:29:13,326 --> 00:29:18,067
[SPEAKER_06]: And I've been working with a student association at ARC.

530
00:29:19,167 --> 00:29:21,189
[SPEAKER_06]: trying to get some machines worked on.

531
00:29:21,209 --> 00:29:24,392
[SPEAKER_06]: They're checking out the Beachhead 2000, trying to get there a place for something but money.

532
00:29:25,473 --> 00:29:29,216
[SPEAKER_06]: Most likely another DDR machine, but can't count out 5-key.

533
00:29:32,919 --> 00:29:37,883
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's a very minute chance of poppin' music, but yeah, right.

534
00:29:38,184 --> 00:29:38,644
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, right.

535
00:29:42,568 --> 00:29:44,089
[SPEAKER_06]: Why are you all turning it to me?

536
00:29:44,149 --> 00:29:44,830
[SPEAKER_06]: What the fuck?

537
00:29:49,195 --> 00:29:49,655
[SPEAKER_06]: No!

538
00:29:51,116 --> 00:29:54,098
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, let's see.

539
00:29:55,219 --> 00:29:58,101
[SPEAKER_06]: More to come in the FU, so yeah.

540
00:29:59,041 --> 00:30:01,323
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I can concur with that, actually.

541
00:30:01,643 --> 00:30:05,505
[SPEAKER_07]: And now, if you noticed, I saved our two guests for last, and one's on the phone right now.

542
00:30:06,266 --> 00:30:08,107
[SPEAKER_07]: Must be on a booty call, so we'll talk to Aaron.

543
00:30:09,528 --> 00:30:10,068
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, never mind.

544
00:30:11,249 --> 00:30:11,809
[SPEAKER_07]: Never mind.

545
00:30:12,410 --> 00:30:13,230
[SPEAKER_07]: Never mind, this is Dad.

546
00:30:16,857 --> 00:30:17,938
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for watching!

547
00:30:37,242 --> 00:30:42,392
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, my week was full of planning for a friend, planning a birthday party for a friend.

548
00:30:42,552 --> 00:30:43,814
[SPEAKER_03]: A surprise birthday party.

549
00:30:44,395 --> 00:30:48,282
[SPEAKER_03]: Which, by the way, when we surprised her, I've never seen her turn more red until that day.

550
00:30:49,201 --> 00:30:50,361
[SPEAKER_03]: and she started crying too.

551
00:30:50,481 --> 00:30:52,922
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was a really good party and I slept over.

552
00:30:53,642 --> 00:31:00,944
[SPEAKER_03]: So I am running on about three hours of sleep, a sip of DNL, some water, some orange juice.

553
00:31:00,964 --> 00:31:01,644
[SPEAKER_13]: Don't forget the penguin mint.

554
00:31:02,284 --> 00:31:02,544
[SPEAKER_03]: Huh?

555
00:31:02,704 --> 00:31:03,665
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't forget the penguin mint.

556
00:31:03,745 --> 00:31:07,966
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, the penguin mint and I don't know what else I'm running on.

557
00:31:08,186 --> 00:31:09,346
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi and welcome to college.

558
00:31:11,106 --> 00:31:14,287
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I feel vaguely hungry right now but it hasn't hit me yet.

559
00:31:14,307 --> 00:31:15,887
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm hungry too.

560
00:31:15,907 --> 00:31:16,868
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's get the blue chip.

561
00:31:16,908 --> 00:31:17,388
[SPEAKER_03]: No!

562
00:31:22,822 --> 00:31:48,814
[SPEAKER_03]: by the way, my apartment has two vents for those of you that don't know I'm currently in Davis right now and I will be here for the rest of the year my apartment has two vents none of which are in any of the bedrooms my toilet leaks there's a big water stain there's a water stain on my ceiling

563
00:31:49,758 --> 00:31:52,539
[SPEAKER_03]: We won't have any internet for the next two days.

564
00:31:54,179 --> 00:31:55,139
[SPEAKER_03]: Yay, no internet.

565
00:31:55,199 --> 00:31:57,200
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't get Comcast.

566
00:31:57,700 --> 00:31:58,780
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think we have Comcast.

567
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:01,421
[SPEAKER_08]: You're getting DSL, right?

568
00:32:01,501 --> 00:32:02,481
[SPEAKER_08]: That's not Comcast?

569
00:32:02,621 --> 00:32:04,482
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think it's Comcast.

570
00:32:04,542 --> 00:32:05,942
[SPEAKER_03]: Ooh, they're passing around blue chips.

571
00:32:06,702 --> 00:32:09,023

[SPEAKER_03]: So, and now my weekend will be winding down with spending time with this crazy, insane, perverted Orange Lounge crew, which I love so very, very much.

574
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:29,401
[SPEAKER_03]: And yes, it is true, I do have my whip.

575
00:32:30,701 --> 00:32:34,662
[SPEAKER_03]: So there will be a lot of mass bondage orgy tonight.

576
00:32:35,423 --> 00:32:35,683
[SPEAKER_12]: Mass, mass.

577
00:32:35,743 --> 00:32:36,703
[SPEAKER_12]: I heard orgy.

578
00:32:37,123 --> 00:32:37,743
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

579
00:32:37,943 --> 00:32:38,223
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.

580
00:32:43,971 --> 00:32:45,692
[SPEAKER_07]: Not just any orgy, Loki.

581
00:32:46,252 --> 00:32:48,293
[SPEAKER_07]: Ass bondage orgy.

582
00:32:48,613 --> 00:32:50,934
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I thought she said ass bondage.

583
00:32:52,135 --> 00:32:54,056
[SPEAKER_07]: I was like, is that like leather panties?

584
00:32:54,076 --> 00:32:55,177
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, that sounds like fun.

585
00:32:56,157 --> 00:32:57,037
[SPEAKER_07]: Except for the ass part.

586
00:32:57,177 --> 00:32:58,578
[SPEAKER_03]: Ass bondage is super glue.

587
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:02,140
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.

588
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,401
[SPEAKER_07]: Mass orgy sounds great.

589
00:33:05,281 --> 00:33:05,762
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm down.

590
00:33:06,002 --> 00:33:09,183
[SPEAKER_07]: Whoa, whoa, this is a side of Loki I've never seen before.

591
00:33:09,563 --> 00:33:10,364
[SPEAKER_07]: What, mass orgy?

592
00:33:12,975 --> 00:33:15,715
[SPEAKER_07]: I've never seen him just propose a mass orgy like this.

593
00:33:18,376 --> 00:33:18,836
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry.

594
00:33:19,916 --> 00:33:20,176
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway.

595
00:33:20,796 --> 00:33:21,557
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's talk to Shane.

596
00:33:21,657 --> 00:33:23,057
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not sure he was proposing it.

597
00:33:23,077 --> 00:33:24,217
[SPEAKER_09]: I think he was just agreeing with it.

598
00:33:25,157 --> 00:33:27,818
[SPEAKER_07]: I went in order of distance here, so Shane has to be last.

599
00:33:28,478 --> 00:33:29,118
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just kidding.

600
00:33:29,638 --> 00:33:30,938
[SPEAKER_07]: So, how you doing?

601
00:33:31,818 --> 00:33:32,198
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm good.

602
00:33:33,399 --> 00:33:36,339
[SPEAKER_07]: My week sucked because we drove 1,690 miles from Kansas to get here.

603
00:33:36,359 --> 00:33:36,879
[SPEAKER_07]: You counted.

604
00:33:36,899 --> 00:33:36,959
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

605
00:33:36,999 --> 00:33:37,199
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

606
00:33:37,219 --> 00:33:37,319
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

607
00:33:43,015 --> 00:33:44,696
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, you don't have much else to do on the road.

608
00:33:49,059 --> 00:33:50,359
[SPEAKER_07]: You had to drive through Nevada.

609
00:33:50,740 --> 00:33:53,621
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, oh, and I have a serious FU to Elko later.

610
00:33:54,222 --> 00:33:55,442
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh my god, okay.

611
00:33:56,123 --> 00:34:01,606
[SPEAKER_07]: But, yeah, two days of driving, eh, family, eh, Scandia.

612
00:34:02,233 --> 00:34:03,693
[SPEAKER_07]: Had 2DX, that was pretty good.

613
00:34:05,034 --> 00:34:08,055
[SPEAKER_07]: Got AA on Dancer, yay.

614
00:34:08,135 --> 00:34:11,055
[SPEAKER_07]: Died on Yoru no Sunglassu again.

615
00:34:12,036 --> 00:34:15,797
[SPEAKER_07]: And, yeah, just relaxing, taking time off of school.

616
00:34:16,457 --> 00:34:19,458
[SPEAKER_07]: Any other interesting things you've seen in Sacramento while you've been here?

617
00:34:20,518 --> 00:34:21,178
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see.

618
00:34:22,378 --> 00:34:23,479
[SPEAKER_07]: No, no, really, it's been pretty good.

619
00:34:23,499 --> 00:34:23,839
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I know.

620
00:34:23,859 --> 00:34:25,259
[SPEAKER_07]: What did you have for the first time today?

621
00:34:25,479 --> 00:34:26,739
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, Mongolian barbecue.

622
00:34:27,380 --> 00:34:28,440
[SPEAKER_07]: That was awesome.

623
00:34:29,983 --> 00:34:32,564
[SPEAKER_07]: I burnt my tongue and it still hurts, but it was good.

624
00:34:34,985 --> 00:34:39,967
[SPEAKER_07]: We took them to one of the Mongolians that isn't even like one of the really good ones we always go to.

625
00:34:40,007 --> 00:34:42,188
[SPEAKER_07]: We took them to that one we used to go to by my old house.

626
00:34:42,589 --> 00:34:45,210
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just called The Mongolian Barbecue Behind Wasabi.

627
00:34:45,650 --> 00:34:47,751
[SPEAKER_07]: It's okay, but it's not even the best one.

628
00:34:50,432 --> 00:34:52,353
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, you can't have Mongolian barbecue now.

629
00:34:52,393 --> 00:34:53,133
[SPEAKER_07]: They're all closed.

630
00:34:56,034 --> 00:34:57,195
[SPEAKER_07]: I've never had Korean barbecue.

631
00:35:03,206 --> 00:35:05,868
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, so what else are you going to do on your trip?

632
00:35:07,190 --> 00:35:09,992
[SPEAKER_07]: I just got my San Francisco trip cancelled, which is fine.

633
00:35:10,132 --> 00:35:10,713
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

634
00:35:10,913 --> 00:35:11,473
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

635
00:35:12,214 --> 00:35:13,735
[SPEAKER_07]: Dad doesn't want to drive anymore, so.

636
00:35:14,756 --> 00:35:14,936
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh.

637
00:35:15,076 --> 00:35:15,817
[SPEAKER_07]: That's okay.

638
00:35:16,237 --> 00:35:17,478
[SPEAKER_07]: You get to hang with us more.

639
00:35:18,479 --> 00:35:18,820
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh no.

640
00:35:19,180 --> 00:35:21,022
[SPEAKER_07]: You can come over for Vanilla Sky tomorrow night.

641
00:35:21,042 --> 00:35:24,925
[SPEAKER_07]: My spin-off show.

642
00:35:25,646 --> 00:35:26,987
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm so glad you asked, Aaron.

643
00:35:28,649 --> 00:35:34,611
[SPEAKER_07]: Vanilla Sky airs on Orange Lounge Radio every Monday night at 7 o'clock, provided we have a fucking internet connection tomorrow.

644
00:35:35,051 --> 00:35:40,293
[SPEAKER_03]: And on Tuesday nights... God damn it, I'm eating my chips.

645
00:35:42,893 --> 00:35:45,574
[SPEAKER_03]: Tuesday night is Pump Up the Volume with me.

646
00:35:46,795 --> 00:35:48,355
[SPEAKER_03]: Pre-show at 7 o'clock, show at 7.30.

647
00:35:49,336 --> 00:35:49,556
[SPEAKER_03]: To 10.30.

648
00:35:50,896 --> 00:35:52,156
[SPEAKER_03]: No, you can't have any more of my chips.

649
00:35:53,657 --> 00:35:53,777
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh.

650
00:35:55,277 --> 00:35:56,278
[SPEAKER_03]: There's something stuck in here.

651
00:36:00,175 --> 00:36:00,295
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh!

652
00:36:02,535 --> 00:36:03,536
[SPEAKER_03]: No, there's something, anyway.

653
00:36:05,876 --> 00:36:11,597
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's just an hour and a half, I'm sorry, three hours of lots of crap that I decided to play.

654
00:36:12,117 --> 00:36:14,878
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you're in the chat room, you can request something, and if I have it, I'll play it.

655
00:36:15,518 --> 00:36:16,898
[SPEAKER_03]: And if it sucks, I'll laugh at you.

656
00:36:18,478 --> 00:36:19,698
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I talk about killing people.

657
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:22,339
[SPEAKER_03]: Often.

658
00:36:24,259 --> 00:36:24,519
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

659
00:36:24,839 --> 00:36:26,920
[SPEAKER_07]: Will you kill about, will you talk about killing Comcast?

660
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:28,340
[SPEAKER_03]: Will I kill about fucking?

661
00:36:30,959 --> 00:36:33,241
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, hi, there's a mic right here.

662
00:36:33,281 --> 00:36:34,662
[SPEAKER_07]: What do I talk about on my show?

663
00:36:34,882 --> 00:36:38,925
[SPEAKER_03]: First of all, Rob, I don't have much of a reason to because my internet was only out for five minutes.

664
00:36:41,427 --> 00:36:42,908
[SPEAKER_03]: And I wasn't even there when it happened.

665
00:36:43,088 --> 00:36:45,911
[SPEAKER_03]: The only thing that obsessed me about that is I was vending at the time.

666
00:36:46,636 --> 00:36:48,877
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, so now your vending's gone.

667
00:36:48,917 --> 00:36:52,319
[SPEAKER_07]: And your pre-show got pretty much axed, unfortunately.

668
00:36:52,379 --> 00:36:53,859
[SPEAKER_07]: But now you don't have to do one for next week.

669
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:55,240
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess not.

670
00:36:55,260 --> 00:36:59,562
[SPEAKER_07]: I was going to say... Oh, my show.

671
00:36:59,642 --> 00:37:01,002
[SPEAKER_07]: Aaron asked what I talk about on my show.

672
00:37:01,082 --> 00:37:07,225
[SPEAKER_07]: I talk about... We talk about news stories sometimes, and then we sometimes get into other games.

673
00:37:07,405 --> 00:37:08,986
[SPEAKER_07]: We talk about Puzzle Pirates a little bit.

674
00:37:09,246 --> 00:37:10,266
[SPEAKER_07]: We talk about Ragnarok.

675
00:37:10,286 --> 00:37:11,927
[SPEAKER_07]: We talk about console games.

676
00:37:12,988 --> 00:37:13,268
[SPEAKER_07]: I saw...

677
00:37:14,471 --> 00:37:16,712
[SPEAKER_07]: So now you even have more reason to join DarkSakura's forums.

678
00:37:18,353 --> 00:37:20,494
[SPEAKER_07]: And just general crap.

679
00:37:20,514 --> 00:37:21,955
[SPEAKER_07]: We have little bits that we do every week.

680
00:37:22,015 --> 00:37:25,317
[SPEAKER_07]: We do video game trivia to bad music.

681
00:37:26,057 --> 00:37:29,879
[SPEAKER_07]: And we do guest the Yahoo talkback because people on Yahoo are idiots.

682
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:33,541
[SPEAKER_07]: So tune in and see for yourself.

683
00:37:33,981 --> 00:37:35,382
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, I just want to answer the question.

684
00:37:35,422 --> 00:37:37,143
[SPEAKER_07]: Anything else you want to say about your show, Jamie, on Tuesdays?

685
00:37:39,921 --> 00:37:47,528
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to try to do video game music trivia, like actual where I play music and people guess, for an hour on my show.

686
00:37:48,188 --> 00:37:52,292
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's see if anyone can dethrone Dark Tetsuya.

687
00:37:53,893 --> 00:37:54,133
[SPEAKER_03]: Huh?

688
00:37:54,814 --> 00:37:55,815
[SPEAKER_03]: They can't hear what you're saying.

689
00:37:59,018 --> 00:38:02,581
[SPEAKER_09]: Can he do it?

690
00:38:02,601 --> 00:38:03,361
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll see when I'll start it.

691
00:38:03,381 --> 00:38:04,022
[SPEAKER_03]: You just gotta be there.

692
00:38:04,242 --> 00:38:06,784
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

693
00:38:07,385 --> 00:38:07,625
[SPEAKER_03]: That's

694
00:38:10,677 --> 00:38:11,197
[SPEAKER_07]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft

695
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:58,355
[SPEAKER_07]: so it's okay if we burn it but Wednesday we'll be playing Max 2 live on air so for those of you that can't get it right now because of money issues or whatever you can play it vicariously through us that's the whole idea and don't worry you'll lose interest just as fast as we will yes

696
00:38:58,815 --> 00:38:59,955
[SPEAKER_07]: and then you won't even want to buy it.

697
00:39:00,195 --> 00:39:03,596
[SPEAKER_07]: But with DDR Max, we actually did this and it was somewhat more successful than we thought.

698
00:39:03,696 --> 00:39:06,017
[SPEAKER_07]: I remember when I got Max, I went live with it.

699
00:39:06,037 --> 00:39:07,917
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of you really liked tuning in and listening to it.

700
00:39:07,977 --> 00:39:09,357
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'll have the webcam going and everything.

701
00:39:09,797 --> 00:39:11,858
[SPEAKER_07]: So tune in for that this Wednesday.

702
00:39:11,898 --> 00:39:14,718
[SPEAKER_07]: And the next Wednesday, if it works out... What?

703
00:39:14,999 --> 00:39:21,740
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I was just going to say that the first time we did that with Max, you kind of didn't have it very well set up.

704
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:23,220
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it was kind of a shitty set up.

705
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:26,301
[SPEAKER_07]: But you can already tell it's going to be much better this time because we have Loki's toys.

706
00:39:28,175 --> 00:39:40,128
[SPEAKER_07]: Next Wednesday, the T's aren't crossed and the I's aren't dotted, but we're hoping that we're going to be teaming up with another website to bring you some exclusive programming.

707
00:39:40,188 --> 00:39:40,889
[SPEAKER_07]: That's all I can say.

708
00:39:42,699 --> 00:39:45,060
[SPEAKER_07]: Some very interesting debut programming next Wednesday.

709
00:39:45,601 --> 00:39:46,361
[SPEAKER_07]: Just a one-off show.

710
00:39:46,381 --> 00:39:48,162
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't care about, but whatever.

711
00:39:49,062 --> 00:39:50,723
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't sound too excited.

712
00:39:51,824 --> 00:39:53,425
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to be big, though.

713
00:39:53,445 --> 00:39:55,406
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of you guys are going to be all woke.

714
00:39:55,466 --> 00:39:56,746
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, you friggin' losers.

715
00:39:57,727 --> 00:39:58,527
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, Loki.

716
00:40:01,189 --> 00:40:02,649
[SPEAKER_07]: I haven't been there in a long time.

717
00:40:02,669 --> 00:40:03,830
[SPEAKER_07]: Why are you giving this to me?

718
00:40:04,530 --> 00:40:04,710
[SPEAKER_10]: Here.

719
00:40:05,070 --> 00:40:05,711
[SPEAKER_07]: What are you doing?

720
00:40:05,731 --> 00:40:07,292
[SPEAKER_07]: You're a friggin' nut.

721
00:40:09,511 --> 00:40:10,491
[SPEAKER_07]: I was supposed to talk about my show.

722
00:40:10,992 --> 00:40:14,493
[SPEAKER_07]: My show is called Mass Bondage Orgy.

723
00:40:14,573 --> 00:40:16,114
[SPEAKER_07]: It's every Thursday.

724
00:40:16,674 --> 00:40:19,695
[SPEAKER_07]: We have a Mass Bondage Orgy in the middle of the room.

725
00:40:19,875 --> 00:40:22,176
[SPEAKER_07]: We kind of moved the table over because, you know, it's kind of in the way.

726
00:40:24,697 --> 00:40:27,318
[SPEAKER_07]: But that pretty much explains the stains on the ground.

727
00:40:30,694 --> 00:40:34,938
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, so Mass Bonded Georgie every Thursday at 7 o'clock.

728
00:40:35,218 --> 00:40:36,499
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you seriously changing the name?

729
00:40:37,860 --> 00:40:39,141
[SPEAKER_07]: I bet more people would tune in.

730
00:40:40,862 --> 00:40:43,104
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, that would be pretty funny.

731
00:40:43,905 --> 00:40:54,694
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki's been having... I feel bad because people tune in to listen to my train wreck of a show, and Jamie gets some pretty good listenership on her show, but for some reason you guys are not tuning in on Thursdays.

732
00:40:54,934 --> 00:40:55,895
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, guess what, you guys?

733
00:40:55,995 --> 00:40:57,056
[SPEAKER_07]: Friends sucks.

734
00:40:57,216 --> 00:40:59,317
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't watch Friends, listen to Loki's show.

735
00:40:59,538 --> 00:41:05,161
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, if the same amount of people keep tuning in constantly, I guess I'm going to have to stop doing my show.

736
00:41:05,241 --> 00:41:07,483
[SPEAKER_07]: It'll take a day off, you know.

737
00:41:10,344 --> 00:41:10,765
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

738
00:41:11,665 --> 00:41:12,626
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you need to borrow a TV?

739
00:41:12,646 --> 00:41:13,286
[SPEAKER_07]: We have an extra.

740
00:41:15,808 --> 00:41:16,388
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll see what we can do.

741
00:41:16,468 --> 00:41:17,049
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll see what we can do.

742
00:41:18,950 --> 00:41:20,511
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm willing to sell mine for cheap.

743
00:41:23,922 --> 00:41:28,845
[SPEAKER_07]: I have a nice 19 inch TV, pretty much like new, I just upgraded to a 25.

744
00:41:28,945 --> 00:41:33,188
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, Livewire, this is why no one tunes in Loki, talk about Livewire.

745
00:41:33,288 --> 00:41:39,372
[SPEAKER_07]: Livewire, it's my mixing show, it's been going on for like 7 weeks now, except for one week where I didn't do it because it was my birthday.

746
00:41:39,992 --> 00:41:40,733
[SPEAKER_07]: And then, um...

747
00:41:41,696 --> 00:41:53,845
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, so we did last week was Bomani remixed music and we played a lot of like erotic trance stuff and then a lot of just remix stuff like from 2DX and DDR and that kind of crap.

748
00:41:54,525 --> 00:42:01,591
[SPEAKER_07]: And then, you know, you guys were, you know, treated to a very nice set, you know, all four of you that tuned in.

749
00:42:02,191 --> 00:42:05,854
[SPEAKER_07]: And actually, you know what, it was a good set of music.

750
00:42:06,034 --> 00:42:06,654
[SPEAKER_07]: It was some good stuff.

751
00:42:06,674 --> 00:42:08,256
[SPEAKER_07]: And you had some stuff in there we never heard before.

752
00:42:08,316 --> 00:42:10,277
[SPEAKER_07]: Like you had the long version of that Drifting Away mix.

753
00:42:10,297 --> 00:42:10,857
[SPEAKER_07]: That was cool.

754
00:42:11,098 --> 00:42:11,358
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

755
00:42:13,237 --> 00:42:16,678
[SPEAKER_07]: Pretty much, um, yeah, my show, I give it like a C+.

756
00:42:16,938 --> 00:42:17,658
[SPEAKER_07]: It's okay.

757
00:42:18,439 --> 00:42:20,259
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like... Yeah, don't sell it.

758
00:42:20,659 --> 00:42:23,100
[SPEAKER_07]: You sure know how to sell your show, Loki, I'll tell ya.

759
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:25,041
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the best damn thing ever.

760
00:42:25,101 --> 00:42:25,661
[SPEAKER_07]: There you go.

761
00:42:25,781 --> 00:42:26,321
[SPEAKER_07]: There you go.

762
00:42:26,381 --> 00:42:27,882
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the best damn thing ever.

763
00:42:28,462 --> 00:42:28,662
[SPEAKER_07]: Ooh.

764
00:42:29,042 --> 00:42:30,983
[SPEAKER_07]: Women get naked on Loki's show.

765
00:42:31,143 --> 00:42:31,643
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, hell yes.

766
00:42:33,697 --> 00:42:35,758
[SPEAKER_07]: They're just naked on the other side of the computer.

767
00:42:36,078 --> 00:42:36,479
[SPEAKER_07]: That's it.

768
00:42:36,579 --> 00:42:40,281
[SPEAKER_07]: From now on, for my show, I'm going to put a live nudie picture on the webcam.

769
00:42:41,021 --> 00:42:41,762
[SPEAKER_07]: There you go.

770
00:42:42,002 --> 00:42:42,662
[SPEAKER_07]: There you go.

771
00:42:42,802 --> 00:42:44,063
[SPEAKER_07]: Instead of for people to tune in.

772
00:42:44,143 --> 00:42:45,424
[SPEAKER_07]: Nudity on live wire.

773
00:42:46,084 --> 00:42:47,025
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a sweep stunt.

774
00:42:48,566 --> 00:42:49,046
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

775
00:42:49,907 --> 00:42:50,207
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.

776
00:42:50,727 --> 00:42:53,609
[SPEAKER_03]: He needs to have like a flash version of Gals Panic.

777
00:42:54,549 --> 00:42:55,950
[SPEAKER_03]: That only is up during his show.

778
00:42:56,470 --> 00:42:57,131
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're tuned in.

779
00:42:57,491 --> 00:42:57,931
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow.

780
00:42:58,431 --> 00:42:58,832
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, no.

781
00:43:00,435 --> 00:43:00,875
[SPEAKER_07]: There you go.

782
00:43:01,176 --> 00:43:03,458
[SPEAKER_07]: Marin says, the best damn remix show ever.

783
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:10,305
[SPEAKER_07]: I like, it is the best damn live Bomani remixing show on live 365.

784
00:43:10,605 --> 00:43:11,966
[SPEAKER_07]: We know this for a fact.

785
00:43:13,568 --> 00:43:14,128
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

786
00:43:15,470 --> 00:43:16,771
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, all one of them.

787
00:43:17,992 --> 00:43:18,332
[SPEAKER_07]: Loser.

788
00:43:20,353 --> 00:43:22,375
[SPEAKER_07]: Freakin' A, yeah, so it's my show.

789
00:43:22,755 --> 00:43:26,038
[SPEAKER_07]: I try to have it prepared before, you know, I go live.

790
00:43:26,459 --> 00:43:28,300
[SPEAKER_07]: Sometimes I do, sometimes I don't.

791
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:33,064
[SPEAKER_07]: Like this week, I just kind of pulled it together five minutes after the show started, so.

792
00:43:35,787 --> 00:43:36,968
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, they all are.

793
00:43:37,268 --> 00:43:41,292
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, if I'm not mistaking, don't we have a new Loki remix we're debuting tonight?

794
00:43:41,732 --> 00:43:42,253
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

795
00:43:42,973 --> 00:43:43,093
[SPEAKER_07]: Ah!

796
00:43:43,474 --> 00:43:45,536
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll do that towards the end of the show, because, um...

797
00:43:47,904 --> 00:43:49,325
[SPEAKER_07]: I have banned that guy five times on BBRP.

798
00:44:12,998 --> 00:44:14,600
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you done whoring out Livewire?

799
00:44:15,260 --> 00:44:18,624
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, speaking of whores, plenty of whores on Livewire!

800
00:44:18,664 --> 00:44:19,605
[SPEAKER_07]: Lots of whores!

801
00:44:20,286 --> 00:44:21,807
[SPEAKER_07]: And mass bondage.

802
00:44:22,188 --> 00:44:24,370
[SPEAKER_07]: In fact, we're just gonna play, like, pornos.

803
00:44:24,390 --> 00:44:28,715
[SPEAKER_07]: Nah, that's alright.

804
00:44:29,555 --> 00:44:31,237
[SPEAKER_07]: He has his own collection in the closet.

805
00:44:33,039 --> 00:44:33,439
[SPEAKER_07]: Nah.

806
00:44:34,420 --> 00:44:35,502
[SPEAKER_07]: Just have handcuffs.

807
00:44:36,758 --> 00:44:38,499
[SPEAKER_07]: And those are the lame handcuffs, too.

808
00:44:38,839 --> 00:44:39,839
[SPEAKER_07]: Are they fuzzy handcuffs?

809
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:43,121
[SPEAKER_07]: No, they're plastic handcuffs I got with the Lupin kit.

810
00:44:48,203 --> 00:44:48,843
[SPEAKER_07]: No one missed it.

811
00:44:49,723 --> 00:44:50,083
[SPEAKER_07]: I got it.

812
00:44:50,143 --> 00:44:50,604
[SPEAKER_07]: It was great.

813
00:44:51,364 --> 00:44:53,665
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, we kind of cut Shane off.

814
00:44:55,185 --> 00:45:00,127
[SPEAKER_07]: I feel bad because Aaron gave us a chance to openly whore out our shows, and we just jumped all over it.

815
00:45:00,167 --> 00:45:02,728
[SPEAKER_07]: We're like, screw the guy who came out here 1,700 miles.

816
00:45:06,167 --> 00:45:08,888
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that we just hopped on that one and dry humped that segment.

817
00:45:10,428 --> 00:45:12,289
[SPEAKER_07]: Plenty of dry humping on Livewire.

818
00:45:15,570 --> 00:45:18,971
[SPEAKER_07]: We apologize for dry humping your monologue, you may now continue.

819
00:45:20,572 --> 00:45:24,733
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, dry humping the monologue, sex with my dad, sex with my uncle, God.

820
00:45:36,670 --> 00:45:43,172
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, I didn't really have anything else to say except for it's awesome here and I miss it a lot.

821
00:45:43,792 --> 00:45:47,194
[SPEAKER_07]: Anybody else have anything to say, Rob?

822
00:45:48,974 --> 00:45:50,655
[SPEAKER_07]: Is somebody trying to ban Nostald?

823
00:45:51,455 --> 00:45:52,855
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I'm copying his quote.

824
00:45:53,316 --> 00:45:54,076
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't ban him.

825
00:45:54,576 --> 00:45:56,637
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not banning him, you retard.

826
00:45:56,657 --> 00:45:57,337
[SPEAKER_07]: Was somebody just...

827
00:46:02,426 --> 00:46:04,467
[SPEAKER_07]: I already ended it again.

828
00:46:04,487 --> 00:46:08,510
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, shit, maybe we ought to just go to a break then.

829
00:46:08,530 --> 00:46:08,670
[SPEAKER_07]: Eh, no.

830
00:46:08,710 --> 00:46:11,972
[SPEAKER_07]: Why don't I just hand the mic to Jamie?

831
00:46:28,806 --> 00:46:35,948
[SPEAKER_03]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

832
00:46:55,738 --> 00:46:59,882
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh wait, I lost the link for our forums.

833
00:47:00,102 --> 00:47:01,704
[SPEAKER_07]: Where are our forums, Rob?

834
00:47:02,845 --> 00:47:07,249
[SPEAKER_07]: www.kaleebomani.com Click on forums.

835
00:47:18,661 --> 00:47:19,381
[SPEAKER_03]: No, not on me.

836
00:47:19,661 --> 00:47:27,144
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, let's... So everybody, send Rob, flood Rob with private messages with everything that pisses you off.

837
00:47:27,364 --> 00:47:28,284
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, sounds good to me.

838
00:47:29,584 --> 00:47:30,705
[SPEAKER_07]: And then ping him.

839
00:47:30,745 --> 00:47:32,945
[SPEAKER_07]: God, our connection sucks enough thanks to Comcast.

840
00:47:35,406 --> 00:47:38,147
[SPEAKER_03]: And then everyone, ping Nostylan.

841
00:47:39,527 --> 00:47:39,988
[SPEAKER_03]: At once.

842
00:47:40,128 --> 00:47:41,168
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't ping Nostylan.

843
00:47:48,093 --> 00:47:49,154
[SPEAKER_12]: Hump the boxes!

844
00:47:57,620 --> 00:48:01,202
[SPEAKER_03]: By the way, for the record, Diet Vanilla Pepsi tastes like shit.

845
00:48:04,324 --> 00:48:10,449
[SPEAKER_03]: Because aspartame is bad for you, and it turns to a chemical that's like formaldehyde when heated to body temperature.

846
00:48:10,469 --> 00:48:11,750
[SPEAKER_03]: Really?

847
00:48:11,770 --> 00:48:12,090
[SPEAKER_03]: Really?

848
00:48:15,580 --> 00:48:17,061
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why Propel is better for you.

849
00:48:21,263 --> 00:48:24,665
[SPEAKER_03]: The V8 is made with... V8 Red Splash.

850
00:48:25,025 --> 00:48:25,305
[SPEAKER_07]: It's good.

851
00:48:25,325 --> 00:48:25,905
[SPEAKER_03]: With Splenda.

852
00:48:26,145 --> 00:48:27,366
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, it's the regular.

853
00:48:27,746 --> 00:48:28,687
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not Diet Splash.

854
00:48:31,108 --> 00:48:32,649
[SPEAKER_03]: There's real V8 Splash in the fridge.

855
00:48:35,530 --> 00:48:38,252
[SPEAKER_03]: He'll go beat up a pineapple so you can have the juice of the pineapple.

856
00:48:39,358 --> 00:48:40,579
[SPEAKER_03]: This is really good radio.

857
00:48:40,719 --> 00:48:42,861
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, so Rob, where's my music?

858
00:48:43,301 --> 00:48:46,743
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, we're still having some buffering issues.

859
00:48:46,863 --> 00:48:47,544
[SPEAKER_07]: Son of a bitch.

860
00:48:49,125 --> 00:48:51,547
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to buffer Comcast in about two seconds.

861
00:48:52,607 --> 00:48:54,108
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we'll just start off without it.

862
00:48:54,169 --> 00:48:55,049
[SPEAKER_03]: This is fucked up.

863
00:48:55,109 --> 00:48:55,529
[SPEAKER_03]: Here we go.

864
00:48:56,110 --> 00:48:56,610
[SPEAKER_03]: Hold on, hold on.

865
00:48:56,630 --> 00:48:57,731
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm getting your song.

866
00:49:00,213 --> 00:49:01,233
[SPEAKER_07]: Wait, I'm racing you now.

867
00:49:03,855 --> 00:49:05,176
[SPEAKER_07]: Shit, I went into the wrong directory.

868
00:49:05,216 --> 00:49:05,837
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm fucked now.

869
00:49:09,888 --> 00:49:11,429
[SPEAKER_03]: This is really, really good radio.

870
00:49:11,489 --> 00:49:12,190
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm very impressed.

871
00:49:12,210 --> 00:49:13,190
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a bit further into it.

872
00:49:13,230 --> 00:49:14,051
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, there we go.

873
00:49:14,091 --> 00:49:14,491
Here it is.

874
00:49:34,005 --> 00:49:48,855
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, the first one of the week goes toward one of the moderators on a forum that I roleplay on, and I'm not going to say the forum yet, because I actually have no problem with everybody else but this moderator, who's abusing his power.

875
00:49:49,395 --> 00:49:52,417
[SPEAKER_03]: First of all, okay, this is funny, he accuses me of flaming.

876
00:49:53,358 --> 00:49:56,640
[SPEAKER_03]: Accuses me of, you know, all this stuff.

877
00:49:56,960 --> 00:49:59,582
[SPEAKER_03]: The first thing is, how many boards do I moderate on now?

878
00:50:00,022 --> 00:50:01,884
[SPEAKER_03]: Five, six, seven boards?

879
00:50:02,544 --> 00:50:03,445
[SPEAKER_03]: An admin three?

880
00:50:04,625 --> 00:50:11,110
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, this has struck me, so I've reported him to the side admin, so that we can be careful, please.

881
00:50:11,810 --> 00:50:16,413
[SPEAKER_03]: Unless, you know, he's dry-humping the admins.

882
00:50:16,513 --> 00:50:20,135
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, hold on.

883
00:50:21,836 --> 00:50:25,599
[SPEAKER_08]: He'd probably have to be doing more than dry-humping the admins to get away with that.

884
00:50:27,130 --> 00:50:31,654
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I would give the admin of this site more credit than to have such foretaste.

885
00:50:31,794 --> 00:50:32,655
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll go ahead.

886
00:50:33,235 --> 00:50:47,708
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, if it turns out that there's no resolution to this soon, then I'm going to do some very public announcements and possibly report the site to their sponsor.

887
00:50:49,269 --> 00:50:49,329
[SPEAKER_03]: Ooh.

888
00:50:51,789 --> 00:50:52,590
[SPEAKER_03]: because you know what?

889
00:50:53,631 --> 00:50:55,752
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a few things that I tolerate.

890
00:50:56,713 --> 00:50:57,454
[SPEAKER_03]: Everyone knows me.

891
00:50:57,514 --> 00:51:01,757
[SPEAKER_03]: If I have a problem with the service, even if it's free, oh, I will let them know.

892
00:51:02,017 --> 00:51:02,838
[SPEAKER_03]: I will let them know.

893
00:51:02,958 --> 00:51:12,746
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yes, I'm a good moderator who hardly checks the board anymore.

894
00:51:13,166 --> 00:51:15,208
[SPEAKER_03]: But no, that was really my only thing.

895
00:51:15,909 --> 00:51:18,831
[SPEAKER_03]: One goes, you know, I was really, I guess, lonely.

896
00:51:20,595 --> 00:51:21,756
[SPEAKER_03]: Nobody came to my house!

897
00:51:23,217 --> 00:51:23,797
[SPEAKER_03]: Damn you, people.

898
00:51:24,998 --> 00:51:35,625
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was... So I was there, um... And then... And then, uh... Really nothing else happened.

899
00:51:35,925 --> 00:51:37,206
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

900
00:51:38,287 --> 00:51:39,207
[SPEAKER_07]: It's evil sounding.

901
00:51:40,848 --> 00:51:41,589
[SPEAKER_07]: Fine!

902
00:51:41,849 --> 00:51:44,191
[SPEAKER_07]: I just deleted it off the damn playlist, too.

903
00:51:45,551 --> 00:51:49,254
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys are never satisfied.

904
00:51:51,943 --> 00:51:53,183
[SPEAKER_07]: Just keep this.

905
00:51:57,465 --> 00:52:00,026
[SPEAKER_07]: Aaron says they won't be satisfied until you start doing sexual favors.

906
00:52:00,226 --> 00:52:01,166
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, who wants dibs?

907
00:52:01,527 --> 00:52:03,167
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm joking.

908
00:52:03,227 --> 00:52:04,868
[SPEAKER_07]: Fine, here you go.

909
00:52:04,888 --> 00:52:05,788
[SPEAKER_07]: Hope you're happy.

910
00:52:09,289 --> 00:52:14,011
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyways, F you to Comcast, because, I don't know, everyone was mad at them, so.

911
00:52:14,852 --> 00:52:19,233
[SPEAKER_07]: But I got to eat my ultimate cheeseburger today, because of that.

912
00:52:19,953 --> 00:52:21,054
[SPEAKER_07]: Jack in the Box should be paying you.

913
00:52:21,656 --> 00:52:21,936
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

914
00:52:22,877 --> 00:52:28,321
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyways, F you to the fact that my stuff costs so much for this damn cabinet.

915
00:52:28,442 --> 00:52:29,663
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, why can't it be free?

916
00:52:30,363 --> 00:52:30,964
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just wood.

917
00:52:31,184 --> 00:52:32,605
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, trees are dead anyways.

918
00:52:33,626 --> 00:52:35,167
[SPEAKER_07]: F you to that.

919
00:52:35,287 --> 00:52:39,290
[SPEAKER_07]: F you to the fact that Lowe's doesn't have the size brackets I need for my...

920
00:52:40,894 --> 00:52:48,759
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, Keyboard Tray, so I couldn't get them after wandering hours through that store looking for keyboard tray bracket thingies.

921
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:50,680
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that sucks.

922
00:52:50,921 --> 00:52:52,742
[SPEAKER_07]: But, um, uh, what else?

923
00:52:53,102 --> 00:53:03,889
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, um, F you for a cable going out because I was downloading, um, Evil Dead 1-2, Army of Darkness, and Into the Woods, and that stopped about 77%.

924
00:53:05,510 --> 00:53:09,653
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, F you to people at my work because they just suck.

925
00:53:10,885 --> 00:53:11,746
[SPEAKER_07]: You really annoy me.

926
00:53:12,587 --> 00:53:21,475
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, if I'm on the bottom floor of my company and I'm next to the elevator, if you ask me if I'm going up, I'm gonna hit you.

927
00:53:22,435 --> 00:53:23,256
[SPEAKER_07]: I have no choice.

928
00:53:23,396 --> 00:53:24,337
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't go down.

929
00:53:24,818 --> 00:53:25,698
[SPEAKER_07]: I have to go up.

930
00:53:26,659 --> 00:53:28,101
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe they want you to go down.

931
00:53:30,303 --> 00:53:32,244
[SPEAKER_07]: In that bondage orgy of yours.

932
00:53:33,085 --> 00:53:33,966
[SPEAKER_07]: Not with that old bitch.

933
00:53:35,199 --> 00:53:38,201
[SPEAKER_07]: There's this one bitch that walks around at work, I swear to god she's like a zombie.

934
00:53:38,421 --> 00:53:39,702
[SPEAKER_07]: She should be dead already.

935
00:53:40,143 --> 00:53:42,885
[SPEAKER_07]: She just looks so decrepit and old and smoking.

936
00:53:42,905 --> 00:53:44,706
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just like counting the seconds.

937
00:53:47,048 --> 00:53:47,928
[SPEAKER_07]: Effie to NASA.

938
00:53:48,989 --> 00:53:56,115
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, crashing something that costs 1.5 billion dollars is pretty stupid just because you didn't want to contaminate a moon on Jupiter.

939
00:53:57,085 --> 00:54:00,149
[SPEAKER_07]: with bacteria that might be on the satellite probe.

940
00:54:00,689 --> 00:54:03,532
[SPEAKER_07]: Who gives a flying fuck what happens to the moons of Jupiter?

941
00:54:03,793 --> 00:54:06,876
[SPEAKER_07]: They can fly away and smash into Neptune for all I care.

942
00:54:07,477 --> 00:54:08,939
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't really matter.

943
00:54:09,279 --> 00:54:12,803
[SPEAKER_07]: And if, oh, we kill life on Jupiter's moon, are we really gonna know?

944
00:54:13,644 --> 00:54:14,105
[SPEAKER_07]: Seriously.

945
00:54:15,296 --> 00:54:17,558
[SPEAKER_07]: and waste $1.5 billion for that.

946
00:54:17,638 --> 00:54:18,539
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what I think it is?

947
00:54:18,939 --> 00:54:29,988
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that that satellite didn't cost $1.5 billion, that they pocketed the difference and, you know, financed, God knows what, a penis enlargement for George Bush.

948
00:54:30,548 --> 00:54:30,949
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

949
00:54:32,230 --> 00:54:32,630
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't...

950
00:54:35,148 --> 00:54:44,888
[SPEAKER_03]: They financed that deal when they were trying to unify and automate all of the McDonalds to where it registered everything that every store did, but of course that failed and the company lost a lot of money.

951
00:54:49,103 --> 00:54:54,627
[SPEAKER_07]: FQ to the RAA and the MPAA because you think that you know how to stop people from file sharing.

952
00:54:55,028 --> 00:55:02,633
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, it's kind of funny because I do remember Napster, you know, and how nothing changed and it's only gotten worse.

953
00:55:02,953 --> 00:55:04,654
[SPEAKER_07]: So what do you think is going to happen this time?

954
00:55:04,674 --> 00:55:09,898
[SPEAKER_07]: You think it's going to magically solve itself and, oh, people are going to stop because they're getting sued.

955
00:55:10,258 --> 00:55:17,844
[SPEAKER_07]: No, when you look at the statistics and you have 261 people out of millions of people downloading stuff, that's a pretty small statistic.

956
00:55:18,504 --> 00:55:22,328
[SPEAKER_07]: Hell, getting struck by lightning, you have more chance than, you know.

957
00:55:24,471 --> 00:55:28,015
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, FE to Hurricanes, because, um, they're windy.

958
00:55:29,136 --> 00:55:29,917
And, um, also, um...

959
00:55:36,838 --> 00:55:39,440
[SPEAKER_07]: FU the fact that I bought these spinners and I can't use them for anything.

960
00:55:40,501 --> 00:55:42,042
[SPEAKER_07]: That sucks, and I cry.

961
00:55:43,523 --> 00:55:44,824
[SPEAKER_07]: Those spinners are so nice.

962
00:55:46,065 --> 00:55:56,833
[SPEAKER_07]: And FU the people who don't like me talking, because I don't care what you think, and I'm going to keep talking over and over and over again, and I'm going to keep rambling on and on and make this segment go longer than it really needs to.

963
00:56:00,476 --> 00:56:02,057
[SPEAKER_07]: Will you talk during the mass bondage orgy?

964
00:56:02,197 --> 00:56:02,558
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yes.

965
00:56:02,698 --> 00:56:05,200
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm doing play-by-play for that mass bondage orgy.

966
00:56:07,262 --> 00:56:12,168
[SPEAKER_07]: And um, F you for not being super duper rich so I can have an outing at a strip club.

967
00:56:17,354 --> 00:56:18,616
[SPEAKER_07]: Because it would be cool.

968
00:56:19,917 --> 00:56:20,818
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I could.

969
00:56:24,983 --> 00:56:25,664
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, maybe.

970
00:56:27,732 --> 00:56:33,376
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyways, um... I might be done.

971
00:56:33,956 --> 00:56:34,176
[SPEAKER_07]: Wait.

972
00:56:34,857 --> 00:56:35,117
[SPEAKER_07]: Wait.

973
00:56:35,877 --> 00:56:36,138
[SPEAKER_07]: Wait.

974
00:56:36,738 --> 00:56:37,258
[SPEAKER_07]: Wait for it.

975
00:56:38,159 --> 00:56:38,839
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, oh, oh.

976
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:39,640
[SPEAKER_07]: I remember now.

977
00:56:40,300 --> 00:56:49,226
[SPEAKER_07]: F you to the stupid discount toy store in the outlet mall, because I was gonna buy about another six ferrets, but none of them freaking squeaked.

978
00:56:50,367 --> 00:56:52,028
[SPEAKER_07]: That would've been hilarious.

979
00:56:52,068 --> 00:56:52,588
[SPEAKER_07]: Darn.

980
00:56:52,828 --> 00:56:53,129
[SPEAKER_07]: Darn.

981
00:56:53,149 --> 00:56:53,829
[SPEAKER_07]: Big darn.

982
00:56:54,189 --> 00:56:54,710
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't worry.

983
00:56:56,271 --> 00:56:56,831
[SPEAKER_07]: But anyways...

984
00:56:58,171 --> 00:56:58,591
[SPEAKER_07]: Soundbite.

985
00:56:59,211 --> 00:56:59,872
[SPEAKER_07]: Soundbite music.

986
00:57:00,212 --> 00:57:07,994
[SPEAKER_07]: My turn.

987
00:57:08,935 --> 00:57:19,698
[SPEAKER_07]: My FUs for this week start off with the one and only Comcast, I hate you, you burn in hell, I hope you catch SARS, and I hope your dick falls off.

988
00:57:20,979 --> 00:57:21,679
[SPEAKER_07]: You suck.

989
00:57:22,631 --> 00:57:29,277
[SPEAKER_07]: We have like, our listeners are going through hell tonight trying to listen to this show because you guys are assifying our connection.

990
00:57:29,297 --> 00:57:30,297
[SPEAKER_07]: I just made a new verb.

991
00:57:32,339 --> 00:57:36,863
[SPEAKER_07]: Assifying our connection and you suck and yeah.

992
00:57:40,666 --> 00:57:43,669
[SPEAKER_09]: Well Comcast may be a guy but it drives like a woman.

993
00:57:46,803 --> 00:57:48,443
[SPEAKER_09]: Just kidding, just kidding, just kidding.

994
00:57:49,064 --> 00:57:50,504
[SPEAKER_09]: Just kidding, god.

995
00:57:52,204 --> 00:57:54,305
[SPEAKER_07]: That joke was too easy, come on.

996
00:57:54,845 --> 00:57:58,586
[SPEAKER_07]: That joke... That was, I love Eren.

997
00:58:01,607 --> 00:58:03,647
[SPEAKER_07]: That joke was way too easy, come on.

998
00:58:09,429 --> 00:58:09,849
[SPEAKER_12]: Anyway...

999
00:58:15,877 --> 00:58:17,538
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a feng shui of the highway.

1000
00:58:17,618 --> 00:58:20,020
[SPEAKER_07]: Aaron's ranting about old drivers, of course.

1001
00:58:20,100 --> 00:58:21,120
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, here, here's the mic.

1002
00:58:21,801 --> 00:58:30,346
[SPEAKER_07]: That's pretty much all I have to... You know what, I'm sure there's plenty of other things I could be mad at right now, but Comcast takes the fucking cake.

1003
00:58:31,147 --> 00:58:33,868
[SPEAKER_07]: F you, there's a microphone in court because I swear to God it's trying to kill me.

1004
00:58:36,550 --> 00:58:38,991
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, you have to listen to the... Wait, no, that was last week.

1005
00:58:39,152 --> 00:58:39,472
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, man.

1006
00:58:41,473 --> 00:58:44,115
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, moving on, let's hear from our other...

1007
00:58:45,129 --> 00:58:45,909
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, let's start.

1008
00:58:45,969 --> 00:58:47,850
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess since Erin has a mic, we'll let her go.

1009
00:58:48,270 --> 00:58:49,890
[SPEAKER_07]: Erin, what do you want to say FU to this week?

1010
00:58:50,291 --> 00:58:52,871
[SPEAKER_03]: First of all, another big FU to Comcast.

1011
00:58:53,692 --> 00:58:56,012
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope that you guys all rot in hell.

1012
00:58:56,492 --> 00:58:57,953
[SPEAKER_03]: And I will go after you all!

1013
00:58:58,453 --> 00:59:00,073
[SPEAKER_03]: I swear to God, you're worse than AOL.

1014
00:59:00,274 --> 00:59:01,434
[SPEAKER_03]: You all know how AOL is.

1015
00:59:02,560 --> 00:59:05,201
[SPEAKER_03]: Another big F you goes to the governor's race right now.

1016
00:59:05,721 --> 00:59:11,684
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't trust Bustamante, Governor Gray Davis is an idiot, and Schwarzenegger doesn't know jack shit about politics.

1017
00:59:12,645 --> 00:59:16,306
[SPEAKER_03]: And unfortunately that looks like the future of our state.

1018
00:59:17,387 --> 00:59:18,908
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, vote for the porn star, people!

1019
00:59:21,089 --> 00:59:21,729
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, you're running.

1020
00:59:25,170 --> 00:59:25,631
[SPEAKER_07]: Jokes!

1021
00:59:26,584 --> 00:59:26,944
[SPEAKER_07]: Jokes.

1022
00:59:27,144 --> 00:59:27,664
[SPEAKER_07]: No, we're fine.

1023
00:59:27,684 --> 00:59:28,265
[SPEAKER_07]: Just keep going.

1024
00:59:29,365 --> 00:59:38,288
[SPEAKER_07]: The problem is there's a problem somewhere between Comcast and Live365 right now, so when we're trying to upload the show to Live365, we're dropping out massively.

1025
00:59:38,428 --> 00:59:40,689
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, but we're still recording as a whole show.

1026
00:59:42,070 --> 00:59:44,631
[SPEAKER_07]: He said drop out, and we're playing drop out.

1027
00:59:48,570 --> 00:59:51,132
[SPEAKER_07]: I hope you catch Saws.

1028
00:59:52,332 --> 00:59:56,535
[SPEAKER_07]: So, yeah, we're just going to keep going because Wednesday and Thursday's Rewind, this won't be here.

1029
00:59:56,555 --> 00:59:59,176
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to still be one big show, so keep going.

1030
00:59:59,717 --> 01:00:13,445
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, I guess another big FU goes to, I would say an unnamed group of people at an arcade who start drama over Initial D. Now!

1031
01:00:14,537 --> 01:00:18,719
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been around DDF Freak long enough to know, okay, it's huge, I know there's drama.

1032
01:00:19,619 --> 01:00:22,500
[SPEAKER_03]: And when there was drama in the parent community, I just said, fuck it, I'm leaving.

1033
01:00:22,520 --> 01:00:26,402
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, but when you start drama in the initial D community, what kind of idiots are you?

1034
01:00:28,623 --> 01:00:33,645
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, just because some guy is going out with some girl doesn't mean you're going to start spreading rumors about him.

1035
01:00:34,265 --> 01:00:36,446
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not a high school anymore, get over it!

1036
01:00:39,828 --> 01:00:47,710
[SPEAKER_03]: This goes to the people who post on the initial D thread on the board that I mod.

1037
01:00:48,130 --> 01:00:49,731
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys start drama again.

1038
01:00:50,131 --> 01:00:51,431
[SPEAKER_03]: I will go after all of you.

1039
01:00:51,451 --> 01:00:52,891
[SPEAKER_07]: That initial D has its own thread.

1040
01:00:53,431 --> 01:00:56,932
[SPEAKER_03]: That's sad.

1041
01:00:56,952 --> 01:00:57,572
[SPEAKER_03]: He'll tell you.

1042
01:00:57,672 --> 01:00:59,993
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm starting the pole position thread on DDR Freak.

1043
01:01:00,233 --> 01:01:01,173
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1044
01:01:01,393 --> 01:01:02,093
[SPEAKER_07]: You're a loser.

1045
01:01:02,694 --> 01:01:04,694
[SPEAKER_07]: No one plays pole position anymore.

1046
01:01:04,754 --> 01:01:06,855
[SPEAKER_07]: I play pole position anymore.

1047
01:01:06,935 --> 01:01:07,475
[SPEAKER_07]: Screw you.

1048
01:01:07,755 --> 01:01:08,235
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, Aaron.

1049
01:01:09,382 --> 01:01:12,866
[SPEAKER_03]: That is my ultimatum to all who post on the initial D thread.

1050
01:01:12,986 --> 01:01:16,569
[SPEAKER_03]: I am counting warnings right now, so don't piss me off.

1051
01:01:16,890 --> 01:01:19,652
[SPEAKER_03]: And I am nearing that time of the month, so don't piss me off.

1052
01:01:19,672 --> 01:01:29,021
[SPEAKER_03]: Because if you do, I will go find... I know people who have large, large swords, and I know where you all live.

1053
01:01:29,041 --> 01:01:31,424
[SPEAKER_07]: And what do you mean by swords?

1054
01:01:32,952 --> 01:01:36,014
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that a sexual innuendo there?

1055
01:01:36,034 --> 01:01:36,654
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, no!

1056
01:01:36,815 --> 01:01:44,039
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean weapons, actual weapons, metal... Sharp metal swords that will slice them all up.

1057
01:01:44,059 --> 01:01:49,903
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, I have how... It's nice that the boards are quiet right now, but... Yeah.

1058
01:01:50,924 --> 01:01:52,485
[SPEAKER_03]: And... Huh?

1059
01:01:53,706 --> 01:01:58,369
[SPEAKER_09]: Coming from a fellow moderator of those boards, it's kind of boring now when there's like three new posts a day.

1060
01:01:59,338 --> 01:02:03,860
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's actually kind of nice because the people posting are all the intelligent people.

1061
01:02:04,280 --> 01:02:04,620
[SPEAKER_09]: True.

1062
01:02:05,400 --> 01:02:11,882
[SPEAKER_03]: If you notice, we've had no AZN people, we've had no Flame Wars, we've had no drama.

1063
01:02:12,303 --> 01:02:12,843
[SPEAKER_11]: Poor Baka.

1064
01:02:13,903 --> 01:02:14,063
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh!

1065
01:02:15,004 --> 01:02:17,064
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, see, now you just gave it away, alright?

1066
01:02:18,045 --> 01:02:18,445
[SPEAKER_10]: Well.

1067
01:02:19,925 --> 01:02:20,205
[SPEAKER_10]: Well.

1068
01:02:20,726 --> 01:02:24,547
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, now that you've blown our coverage, there's no Oliver either, thank God.

1069
01:02:29,127 --> 01:02:42,878
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I guess I'm done with my FUs, other than the fact that a big FU goes to my apartment for the leaky toilet, the noisy fan, the lack of vents, which will suffocate me one day and I'm going to kill my landlady, and the wobbly furniture.

1070
01:02:44,600 --> 01:02:47,562
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah.

1071
01:02:47,582 --> 01:02:48,323
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll hand it over to Andrew.

1072
01:02:48,343 --> 01:02:50,745
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, okay, you can go Josh, that's fine.

1073
01:02:51,485 --> 01:02:51,805
[SPEAKER_07]: Joey.

1074
01:02:53,607 --> 01:02:53,987
[SPEAKER_07]: Josh?

1075
01:02:54,167 --> 01:02:54,828
[SPEAKER_10]: Who's Josh?

1076
01:02:55,088 --> 01:02:55,388
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry.

1077
01:02:57,153 --> 01:02:58,994
[SPEAKER_10]: Nobody.

1078
01:02:59,814 --> 01:03:00,154
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.

1079
01:03:01,714 --> 01:03:02,055
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

1080
01:03:03,135 --> 01:03:04,275
[SPEAKER_10]: My FUs for the week.

1081
01:03:05,156 --> 01:03:08,877
[SPEAKER_10]: I would have to say I'm going to kill the already dead horse.

1082
01:03:09,677 --> 01:03:12,758
[SPEAKER_10]: FU to Comcast, I've been down for five days.

1083
01:03:12,798 --> 01:03:14,859
[SPEAKER_10]: You can't say FU to Comcast enough.

1084
01:03:14,899 --> 01:03:15,499
[SPEAKER_10]: Say it again.

1085
01:03:16,119 --> 01:03:19,120
[SPEAKER_10]: I've been down for five days.

1086
01:03:19,140 --> 01:03:22,501
[SPEAKER_10]: I am having internet withdrawals.

1087
01:03:22,721 --> 01:03:23,902
[SPEAKER_05]: I am tired.

1088
01:03:30,433 --> 01:03:31,974
[SPEAKER_09]: Jokes, people, jokes.

1089
01:03:32,335 --> 01:03:34,417
[SPEAKER_10]: So, yes, that's one of them.

1090
01:03:35,938 --> 01:03:40,242
[SPEAKER_10]: Go to hell with your $57 a month and I've been down for five days.

1091
01:03:40,322 --> 01:03:54,235
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyway, my other FU would be to all the people in Nevada and Northern California that lock their keys in the car and leave their lights on because it makes my life a living hell.

1092
01:03:55,316 --> 01:03:56,237
[SPEAKER_10]: So, that'll be it.

1093
01:03:58,879 --> 01:04:00,241
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, let's hear from Shane.

1094
01:04:01,802 --> 01:04:04,865
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, first off, F you to Elko, Nevada.

1095
01:04:05,585 --> 01:04:08,528
[SPEAKER_10]: I wanted Taco Bell at night because I hadn't eaten anything all day.

1096
01:04:09,509 --> 01:04:13,893
[SPEAKER_10]: And is it so hard to keep your stupid store open till, like, 10.01?

1097
01:04:13,933 --> 01:04:15,975
[SPEAKER_11]: Frickin' closing at 10.

1098
01:04:16,996 --> 01:04:19,258
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, F you to old people because...

1099
01:04:23,886 --> 01:04:30,651
[SPEAKER_09]: I was at Taco Bell and this old guy slammed his door into my parked car and tried to blame it on me, because he's old.

1100
01:04:31,951 --> 01:04:38,476
[SPEAKER_07]: And F you to my living situation because I sleep out in the living room because they can't seem to find room for me in their rooms.

1101
01:04:38,736 --> 01:04:40,037
[SPEAKER_10]: So, yeah.

1102
01:04:40,497 --> 01:04:43,699
[SPEAKER_07]: And F you to driving to California instead of flying because it's really boring.

1103
01:04:45,189 --> 01:04:46,650
[SPEAKER_07]: Wait, do you pay rent at that place?

1104
01:04:47,010 --> 01:04:49,291
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I pay like $1.80 a month.

1105
01:04:49,351 --> 01:04:50,911
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh my god.

1106
01:04:50,931 --> 01:04:53,032
[SPEAKER_07]: I sleep on the couch.

1107
01:04:53,092 --> 01:04:55,573
[SPEAKER_07]: You know how much we pay here?

1108
01:04:56,233 --> 01:04:59,995
[SPEAKER_07]: At least three times a... Well, I mean, well, actually, well, each... Well, it doesn't matter.

1109
01:05:00,035 --> 01:05:00,315
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway.

1110
01:05:00,975 --> 01:05:01,936
[SPEAKER_07]: Point I was trying to make.

1111
01:05:02,116 --> 01:05:03,977
[SPEAKER_07]: If you pay rent there, you should have your own room.

1112
01:05:04,277 --> 01:05:09,099
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, well, this one guy has all his music stuff in there, so... Well, fuck his stuff.

1113
01:05:09,119 --> 01:05:09,879
[SPEAKER_09]: You're more important...

1114
01:05:11,104 --> 01:05:12,744
[SPEAKER_09]: We're trying to kick him out by raising his rent.

1115
01:05:12,844 --> 01:05:19,505
[SPEAKER_07]: I was going to say, sorry if you're listening, dude, but that's not cool to make somebody sleep on the couch unless they're not paying rent, if you're being nice.

1116
01:05:19,605 --> 01:05:22,986
[SPEAKER_07]: And my computer's in the corner, so I can't, like, get any privacy.

1117
01:05:24,666 --> 01:05:25,426
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh my god.

1118
01:05:27,267 --> 01:05:30,327
[SPEAKER_07]: You're robbing this man of his internet pornography.

1119
01:05:30,347 --> 01:05:31,268
[SPEAKER_07]: That's horrible.

1120
01:05:31,308 --> 01:05:31,808
[SPEAKER_08]: Jeez.

1121
01:05:35,148 --> 01:05:38,029
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyway, um, yeah, that's all my FDs, so.

1122
01:05:38,529 --> 01:05:38,889
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1123
01:05:39,269 --> 01:05:39,509
[SPEAKER_07]: Andrew.

1124
01:05:44,776 --> 01:05:51,242
[SPEAKER_06]: First of all, Victor, F you to you, you're not funny, I want my name back, I want my jokes back, bitch.

1125
01:05:52,022 --> 01:05:52,803
[SPEAKER_07]: All five of them.

1126
01:05:56,346 --> 01:06:01,291
[SPEAKER_06]: Second of all, F you to people who get my attention by picking up the phone when I'm online.

1127
01:06:02,011 --> 01:06:05,735
[SPEAKER_06]: Stop it, I'm playing Ragnarok, I'm trying to vend.

1128
01:06:07,196 --> 01:06:09,117
[SPEAKER_06]: Dark, take the phone to the hand, that would be beautiful.

1129
01:06:09,777 --> 01:06:12,439
[SPEAKER_06]: Either that or I rig up a timer or turn off the TV every time I pick up the phone.

1130
01:06:12,479 --> 01:06:17,141
[SPEAKER_07]: Or just the phone, the phone that she uses, just pull the cord out from the back so she picks it up and doesn't do anything.

1131
01:06:17,401 --> 01:06:17,742
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, sure.

1132
01:06:18,362 --> 01:06:20,143
[SPEAKER_06]: She just goes into the other room and picks up her phone.

1133
01:06:20,843 --> 01:06:21,884
[SPEAKER_07]: Unplug that one, too!

1134
01:06:21,904 --> 01:06:32,129
[SPEAKER_06]: We got door locks, so... Anyway, uh, FU to Sakura, that song is a bitch.

1135
01:06:33,530 --> 01:06:35,331
[SPEAKER_06]: Passed it, like, what, fifth try.

1136
01:06:37,105 --> 01:06:37,385
[SPEAKER_06]: No!

1137
01:06:37,905 --> 01:06:39,366
[SPEAKER_07]: Get that whip away from me, Jamie!

1138
01:06:40,807 --> 01:06:44,409
[SPEAKER_03]: In case you guys are wondering, that's the two ferrets tied up with my whip.

1139
01:06:44,889 --> 01:06:45,449
[SPEAKER_07]: On the webcam.

1140
01:06:45,769 --> 01:06:46,670
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, on the webcam.

1141
01:06:46,930 --> 01:06:47,570
[SPEAKER_03]: So, go ahead, Andy.

1142
01:06:50,612 --> 01:06:51,672
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, okay, okay.

1143
01:06:51,732 --> 01:06:53,773
[SPEAKER_06]: How about a mutual FU to Legend of Max, okay?

1144
01:06:54,374 --> 01:06:55,134
[SPEAKER_06]: Just to make it balanced.

1145
01:06:55,654 --> 01:06:56,935
[SPEAKER_06]: Holy shit, he's gonna hit me.

1146
01:07:01,677 --> 01:07:06,600
[SPEAKER_06]: And once again, FU to Angel not being able to tune in today.

1147
01:07:07,330 --> 01:07:08,791
[SPEAKER_06]: It's for what?

1148
01:07:08,811 --> 01:07:09,572
[SPEAKER_06]: A month and a half.

1149
01:07:10,012 --> 01:07:10,433
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, shit!

1150
01:07:12,655 --> 01:07:13,996
[SPEAKER_06]: Parrots flying everywhere!

1151
01:07:14,016 --> 01:07:19,100
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that Orlando?

1152
01:07:19,340 --> 01:07:20,341
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, yeah, that's it.

1153
01:07:22,163 --> 01:07:23,243
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, you didn't do it, puppy?

1154
01:07:23,384 --> 01:07:23,744
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry.

1155
01:07:24,224 --> 01:07:27,067
[SPEAKER_08]: I need to rant a little.

1156
01:07:28,548 --> 01:07:29,329
[SPEAKER_08]: Jeez, watch out here.

1157
01:07:32,011 --> 01:07:32,671
[SPEAKER_08]: Fling that parrot.

1158
01:07:33,772 --> 01:07:34,413
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, um...

1159
01:07:36,283 --> 01:07:38,184
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, uh, yeah, what should I say?

1160
01:07:40,646 --> 01:07:52,574
[SPEAKER_08]: Fuck you to, uh, fuck bad, uh, bike tires because my tires for my bike is sitting flat in my room because it was broken and I need to get respect for it.

1161
01:07:54,075 --> 01:07:57,838
[SPEAKER_08]: And meanwhile, there's spirit baseball going on in the living room.

1162
01:08:04,151 --> 01:08:06,232
[SPEAKER_09]: I can give play-by-play of Ferret Baseball.

1163
01:08:09,173 --> 01:08:10,153
[SPEAKER_09]: Facing up the middle!

1164
01:08:11,334 --> 01:08:12,054
[SPEAKER_09]: Andrew Fields it!

1165
01:08:12,214 --> 01:08:12,874
[SPEAKER_09]: The throw home!

1166
01:08:17,496 --> 01:08:17,956
[SPEAKER_09]: The pitch!

1167
01:08:20,097 --> 01:08:22,538
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a bluebird down the left field line!

1168
01:08:27,867 --> 01:08:35,948
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm getting kind of distracted by the fact that Loki is batting a ferret around the room.

1169
01:08:37,569 --> 01:08:40,949
[SPEAKER_09]: Damn it, I forgot my FUs!

1170
01:08:40,969 --> 01:08:45,170
[SPEAKER_09]: Come on, you can remember!

1171
01:08:45,190 --> 01:08:46,890
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't beat me, Jamie, no!

1172
01:08:51,429 --> 01:08:53,810
[SPEAKER_09]: I think there's no more insanity here!

1173
01:08:56,430 --> 01:08:57,391
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm gonna back up now.

1174
01:08:58,351 --> 01:09:00,952
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to back up this way out of Jamie's range.

1175
01:09:01,872 --> 01:09:03,592
[SPEAKER_09]: Ah, barely just out of the range, okay.

1176
01:09:04,053 --> 01:09:16,176
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, uh, fuck this guy for depriving me of sleep all this week, and, uh, fuck the Tapioca Express and Davis for letting your GDR machine go to shit.

1177
01:09:18,131 --> 01:09:18,731
[SPEAKER_08]: Exactly!

1178
01:09:20,893 --> 01:09:21,954
[SPEAKER_08]: I couldn't agree more!

1179
01:09:21,974 --> 01:09:25,737
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I know, it's just a bitch, isn't it?

1180
01:09:25,917 --> 01:09:31,661
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, totally.

1181
01:09:34,103 --> 01:09:35,304
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, listen, there's you, the ferret.

1182
01:09:35,664 --> 01:09:39,768
[SPEAKER_03]: Dear ferret, what do you think of Orange Lounge Radio?

1183
01:09:42,770 --> 01:09:43,510
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, um... And...

1184
01:09:48,203 --> 01:09:49,604
[SPEAKER_07]: Fuck that arcade, it's in the end.

1185
01:09:51,505 --> 01:09:54,186
[SPEAKER_07]: Now I can finally change the music because it's time for the chatroom FUs.

1186
01:09:55,006 --> 01:09:55,947
[SPEAKER_03]: Give them something happy.

1187
01:09:57,548 --> 01:09:58,768
[SPEAKER_03]: Give them the Ohaska.

1188
01:10:03,070 --> 01:10:05,591
[SPEAKER_07]: Dartetsuya would like to say F you to Comcast.

1189
01:10:05,631 --> 01:10:06,172
[SPEAKER_07]: Enough said.

1190
01:10:06,212 --> 01:10:06,552
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1191
01:10:09,176 --> 01:10:12,297
[SPEAKER_07]: I have something to say in addition to your Initial D Battle Horse comment.

1192
01:10:12,337 --> 01:10:12,458
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1193
01:10:36,431 --> 01:11:02,027
[SPEAKER_03]: because they start too much drama because I don't know why I don't know why you guys yeah that's all it is just drama whatever happened to the times there was like no drama when everyone is happy why do you think I play at home but yeah you don't need to start drama over every single person's life please stop if you bring it to the board I will be very very angry

1194
01:11:04,827 --> 01:11:07,189
[SPEAKER_07]: Fuck this Live365 operator guy.

1195
01:11:07,850 --> 01:11:15,116
[SPEAKER_07]: Because when they can't connect to the stream, when we go out, Live365 operator guy comes on and says, You're listening to a station that is currently unavailable.

1196
01:11:15,416 --> 01:11:19,740
[SPEAKER_03]: Please try... It would be better, though, if they had, like, some lounge music playing.

1197
01:11:19,820 --> 01:11:21,461
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, some Tom Jones.

1198
01:11:23,743 --> 01:11:25,365
[SPEAKER_07]: Moving on with EvilMaliki2DX's FUs.

1199
01:11:25,685 --> 01:11:31,010
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, and fuck the lazy-ass volunteers who didn't do shit in the video game room at JTAF and just wanted to get into the con for free.

1200
01:11:31,932 --> 01:11:36,436
[SPEAKER_07]: and fuck the hotel maids at Best Western Miyako Inn for giving me a hard time.

1201
01:11:37,136 --> 01:11:37,877
[SPEAKER_07]: A hard time.

1202
01:11:39,538 --> 01:11:42,261
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, and fuck Uni's dad for being such a cheap ass.

1203
01:11:45,478 --> 01:11:50,563
[SPEAKER_07]: NoStylin says, my FU of the week is screw little rocks you find in charcoal.

1204
01:11:51,024 --> 01:11:54,167
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, God, you buy the good brands and you still get little pebbles in there.

1205
01:11:54,227 --> 01:11:55,068
[SPEAKER_07]: I go, what the fuck?

1206
01:11:55,348 --> 01:11:59,512
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, you pay $1.99 for a stick of good old charcoal and you get this little pebble.

1207
01:11:59,792 --> 01:12:01,974
[SPEAKER_07]: It just messes up a good drawing.

1208
01:12:02,055 --> 01:12:02,455
[SPEAKER_07]: Grr.

1209
01:12:08,121 --> 01:12:09,342
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I thought it was barbecue charcoal.

1210
01:12:10,666 --> 01:12:12,607
[SPEAKER_03]: You can do really good drawings of BBQ charcoal though.

1211
01:12:13,007 --> 01:12:18,188
[SPEAKER_07]: John Fields would like to say, F you to my inability to learn new languages quickly.

1212
01:12:18,448 --> 01:12:22,529
[SPEAKER_07]: F you to Honda for forgetting to order the part for my car and thus wasting my Saturday.

1213
01:12:23,369 --> 01:12:25,950
[SPEAKER_07]: F you to RCN for not fixing my cable again.

1214
01:12:26,010 --> 01:12:27,431
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, at least they're not as bad as Comcast.

1215
01:12:29,851 --> 01:12:34,532
[SPEAKER_07]: F you to my GameCube making weird clicking sounds and causing PSO to crash all the time.

1216
01:12:35,153 --> 01:12:35,833
[SPEAKER_07]: That's not good.

1217
01:12:35,893 --> 01:12:36,233
[SPEAKER_07]: What would you...

1218
01:12:38,779 --> 01:12:41,181
[SPEAKER_07]: What does it mean if a GameCube is making clicking noises?

1219
01:12:41,261 --> 01:12:41,862
[SPEAKER_07]: That can't be good.

1220
01:12:41,882 --> 01:12:45,585
[SPEAKER_03]: Victor, you are actually a winner for saying that AOL equals Governor Davis.

1221
01:12:46,626 --> 01:12:47,046
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1222
01:12:48,907 --> 01:12:50,309
[SPEAKER_07]: Be nice to Governor Davis.

1223
01:12:51,630 --> 01:12:52,590
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't insult AOL like that.

1224
01:12:56,373 --> 01:13:00,277
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, that was John Fields who has a clicking GameCube.

1225
01:13:02,558 --> 01:13:03,059
[SPEAKER_07]: Chaos!

1226
01:13:05,069 --> 01:13:10,036
[SPEAKER_07]: says F you to government class because it is the stupidest class in the world.

1227
01:13:10,517 --> 01:13:12,720
[SPEAKER_07]: So fucking stupid.

1228
01:13:13,081 --> 01:13:13,381
[SPEAKER_07]: The end.

1229
01:13:14,883 --> 01:13:15,144
[SPEAKER_07]: He did.

1230
01:13:15,184 --> 01:13:17,227
[SPEAKER_07]: He put so fucking stupid.

1231
01:13:20,932 --> 01:13:21,313
[SPEAKER_07]: Minced.

1232
01:13:22,742 --> 01:13:25,024
[SPEAKER_07]: would like to say F you to my digital systems class.

1233
01:13:25,164 --> 01:13:27,886
[SPEAKER_07]: I hate inverse logic and De Morgan's theorem.

1234
01:13:28,687 --> 01:13:29,447
[SPEAKER_07]: Otherwise, I'm good.

1235
01:13:29,788 --> 01:13:34,652
[SPEAKER_07]: Except for the fact that once the buffering is coming from the other side for once.

1236
01:13:34,772 --> 01:13:35,392
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, thanks.

1237
01:13:37,534 --> 01:13:38,315
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks a lot.

1238
01:13:43,279 --> 01:13:43,899
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, boy.

1239
01:13:44,520 --> 01:13:44,960
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, Rob.

1240
01:13:45,240 --> 01:13:45,560
[SPEAKER_05]: Rob.

1241
01:13:45,861 --> 01:13:46,101
[SPEAKER_05]: Rob.

1242
01:13:46,521 --> 01:13:46,721
[SPEAKER_05]: Rob.

1243
01:13:46,841 --> 01:13:47,122
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

1244
01:13:47,482 --> 01:13:47,742
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi.

1245
01:13:47,982 --> 01:13:48,183
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi.

1246
01:13:48,203 --> 01:13:48,243
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi.

1247
01:13:50,353 --> 01:13:54,294
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm gonna shove that ferret up your ass and push the button.

1248
01:13:56,394 --> 01:14:04,876
[SPEAKER_07]: Jason, our buddy down in the southwest, says an FU to myself for missing like three Orange Lounge radios.

1249
01:14:05,496 --> 01:14:06,177
[SPEAKER_07]: Unacceptable.

1250
01:14:06,277 --> 01:14:06,757
[SPEAKER_07]: Fired!

1251
01:14:09,017 --> 01:14:11,938
[SPEAKER_07]: An FU to Live365 for being Microsoft's whores.

1252
01:14:14,907 --> 01:14:19,049
[SPEAKER_02]: By the way, Loki, congratulations about your plan.

1253
01:14:19,949 --> 01:14:25,591
[SPEAKER_07]: Jason would also like to say a F you to stupid computer crap happening to keep me from listening.

1254
01:14:26,892 --> 01:14:27,812
[SPEAKER_07]: You can blame Comcast.

1255
01:14:27,832 --> 01:14:29,333
[SPEAKER_07]: Send those cards and letters to Comcast.

1256
01:14:29,853 --> 01:14:30,713
[SPEAKER_07]: Care of Satan.

1257
01:14:31,774 --> 01:14:36,035
[SPEAKER_07]: StaplerX would like to say F you to the assholes at JTAF also.

1258
01:14:36,376 --> 01:14:39,697
[SPEAKER_07]: They took 10 years off our video program Head's Life.

1259
01:14:42,779 --> 01:14:44,921
[SPEAKER_03]: You should let me run a movie room at one of those cons.

1260
01:14:46,042 --> 01:14:46,983
[SPEAKER_13]: I never found out though.

1261
01:14:47,003 --> 01:14:47,243
[SPEAKER_07]: That's it.

1262
01:14:47,263 --> 01:14:49,104
[SPEAKER_07]: I have read all the FUs that I have been given.

1263
01:14:49,124 --> 01:14:49,485
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you...

1264
01:15:04,016 --> 01:15:05,117
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, did one just pop up?

1265
01:15:06,077 --> 01:15:07,117
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, she's still telling the story.

1266
01:15:07,137 --> 01:15:08,618
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry, did your alcoholist still tell the story here?

1267
01:15:08,998 --> 01:15:13,020
[SPEAKER_07]: I got home and found the driver's side front tire starting to shed its tread.

1268
01:15:14,881 --> 01:15:15,181
[SPEAKER_07]: Ouch.

1269
01:15:15,541 --> 01:15:16,442
[SPEAKER_07]: I took it to Sears.

1270
01:15:17,922 --> 01:15:19,203
[SPEAKER_07]: The story's coming in a little bit too.

1271
01:15:19,223 --> 01:15:22,385
[SPEAKER_07]: While the story's going on, I'm going to say I have read all the FUs at this point.

1272
01:15:22,705 --> 01:15:25,126
[SPEAKER_07]: If you didn't hear yours due to a buffering issue, sorry.

1273
01:15:25,945 --> 01:15:28,227
[SPEAKER_07]: We're just trying to go through the show as we usually do.

1274
01:15:28,707 --> 01:15:34,872
[SPEAKER_07]: The show will play in its entirety without these buffering problems, hopefully, provided Live365 isn't using Comcast.

1275
01:15:35,592 --> 01:15:42,418
[SPEAKER_07]: The show will play through in its entirety on Wednesday and Thursday, and we might, actually, we might play it tomorrow night after Vanilla Sky as well.

1276
01:15:44,539 --> 01:15:48,402
[SPEAKER_07]: Diddy Alcoholic says, took it to Sears, all four of the tires need to get fixed.

1277
01:15:48,702 --> 01:15:49,323
[SPEAKER_07]: All four!

1278
01:15:51,625 --> 01:15:51,885
[SPEAKER_07]: Sucks.

1279
01:15:58,143 --> 01:16:01,064
[SPEAKER_07]: She says actually only three were bad, but she might as well change all four.

1280
01:16:04,685 --> 01:16:08,186
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, tonight, what do you guys think?

1281
01:16:08,366 --> 01:16:11,107
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if we should do a cage match tonight because of our issues.

1282
01:16:11,307 --> 01:16:12,287
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, we're doing a cage match.

1283
01:16:12,307 --> 01:16:14,387
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, what about because of our issues, the guys aren't going to be able to vote?

1284
01:16:15,108 --> 01:16:17,328
[SPEAKER_07]: They're not able to stay on the stream long enough to hear a song.

1285
01:16:18,028 --> 01:16:19,389
[SPEAKER_02]: I went through a lot of trouble.

1286
01:16:20,089 --> 01:16:21,169
[SPEAKER_02]: Poopy on Comcast!

1287
01:16:21,189 --> 01:16:21,909
[SPEAKER_02]: I went through a lot of trouble.

1288
01:16:21,929 --> 01:16:22,890
[SPEAKER_07]: Should we table it to next week?

1289
01:16:25,470 --> 01:16:26,451
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1290
01:16:26,911 --> 01:16:27,631
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I think we're going to...

1291
01:16:28,905 --> 01:16:31,606
[SPEAKER_07]: We could, okay, we could do it this way.

1292
01:16:32,086 --> 01:16:33,646
[SPEAKER_07]: We could instead of letting, well, I don't know.

1293
01:16:33,726 --> 01:16:36,727
[SPEAKER_07]: I could say instead of letting the chat room vote, we could let everybody else here vote.

1294
01:16:36,867 --> 01:16:38,808
[SPEAKER_07]: But that might be kind of tough and biased.

1295
01:16:38,848 --> 01:16:40,568
[SPEAKER_03]: There's enough people here to vote.

1296
01:16:42,389 --> 01:16:43,029
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

1297
01:16:43,049 --> 01:16:44,929
[SPEAKER_07]: What do you guys think?

1298
01:16:45,169 --> 01:16:47,610
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, are we going to do a cage match and have you guys vote?

1299
01:16:50,612 --> 01:16:52,053
[SPEAKER_07]: We can try to let the listeners do it.

1300
01:16:52,073 --> 01:16:52,773
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see what happens.

1301
01:16:53,434 --> 01:16:55,395
[SPEAKER_03]: Let us know what you want to do.

1302
01:16:55,415 --> 01:16:56,476
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you want us to try Cage Match?

1303
01:16:56,596 --> 01:17:02,500
[SPEAKER_07]: If I don't get at least five votes in the chat room, then we're tabling it over to the room here.

1304
01:17:02,800 --> 01:17:04,461
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's what we're going to do.

1305
01:17:06,763 --> 01:17:10,505
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not a big deal, but... Oh, sorry, she didn't write earlier.

1306
01:17:10,866 --> 01:17:11,306
[SPEAKER_07]: That's okay.

1307
01:17:11,446 --> 01:17:11,746
[SPEAKER_07]: It happens.

1308
01:17:12,367 --> 01:17:12,587
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1309
01:17:14,585 --> 01:17:18,688
[SPEAKER_07]: They're saying the stream's okay right now, so we're going to do the cage match right now.

1310
01:17:18,748 --> 01:17:19,068
[SPEAKER_07]: Why not?

1311
01:17:19,088 --> 01:17:19,809
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's just get into it.

1312
01:17:21,550 --> 01:17:23,632
[SPEAKER_07]: We're doing a commercial-free show tonight, apparently.

1313
01:17:24,512 --> 01:17:25,013
[SPEAKER_07]: That's alright.

1314
01:17:25,813 --> 01:17:27,134
[SPEAKER_03]: It might be too commercial anyway.

1315
01:17:31,438 --> 01:17:33,299
[SPEAKER_02]: I was funny, and no one noticed.

1316
01:17:37,813 --> 01:17:42,675
[SPEAKER_07]: Last week in the Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match, the MP3 that I was sent from D.R.

1317
01:17:42,735 --> 01:17:46,917
[SPEAKER_07]: Angel won, and it was a mislabeled MP3, actually.

1318
01:17:46,977 --> 01:17:53,440
[SPEAKER_07]: I found out a little, just after the show, I found out the MP3 was actually mislabeled, so you voted for the wrong thing, actually.

1319
01:17:53,961 --> 01:17:57,742
[SPEAKER_07]: I said on the show that it was a band called Froggy that won.

1320
01:17:58,343 --> 01:18:00,324
[SPEAKER_07]: It's actually Foggy, no R.

1321
01:18:01,024 --> 01:18:03,245
[SPEAKER_07]: So the band that actually won last night was Foggy.

1322
01:18:04,006 --> 01:18:04,706
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry, last week.

1323
01:18:04,906 --> 01:18:09,248
[SPEAKER_07]: Last week was Foggy, and the song is called Come Into My Dream.

1324
01:18:09,329 --> 01:18:11,910
[SPEAKER_07]: So this is the song that won last week.

1325
01:18:12,050 --> 01:18:12,250
[SPEAKER_07]: Huh?

1326
01:18:13,671 --> 01:18:14,091
[SPEAKER_07]: You what?

1327
01:18:15,012 --> 01:18:15,992
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, you downloaded a DJ?

1328
01:18:16,252 --> 01:18:16,693
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, good.

1329
01:18:18,934 --> 01:18:21,115
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, so here it is.

1330
01:18:23,076 --> 01:18:26,098
[SPEAKER_07]: This is the first song you can vote for tonight.

1331
01:18:27,238 --> 01:18:28,259
[SPEAKER_07]: Why are you guys laughing?

1332
01:18:29,079 --> 01:18:29,579
[SPEAKER_07]: Chat room.

1333
01:18:29,600 --> 01:18:30,340
[SPEAKER_07]: Chat room.

1334
01:18:30,700 --> 01:18:34,464
[SPEAKER_07]: Chatroom says, just died as he said do it.

1335
01:18:34,664 --> 01:18:39,208
[SPEAKER_07]: They say the stream's okay right now, so we're gonna do... And apparently we dropped right there.

1336
01:18:41,450 --> 01:18:45,674
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's still gonna work enough for the, uh, for the Cavemen show.

1337
01:18:45,734 --> 01:18:46,295
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's do it.

1338
01:18:47,596 --> 01:18:54,643
[SPEAKER_09]: Um... I'm gonna continue... No, we're recording this.

1339
01:18:54,663 --> 01:18:55,884
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's just get it over with.

1340
01:18:58,746 --> 01:18:59,166
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what?

1341
01:18:59,506 --> 01:19:04,028
[SPEAKER_07]: My monitor stream's still going, so I think they'll be able to get in.

1342
01:19:05,928 --> 01:19:08,169
[SPEAKER_03]: So, cage match!

1343
01:19:12,510 --> 01:19:18,232
[SPEAKER_03]: Since we're having a moment of dead airspace, let's offer a moment of silence for our stream.

1344
01:19:21,758 --> 01:19:23,300
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, let's get into it here.

1345
01:19:23,441 --> 01:19:28,809
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, our monitor stream is still going, so I'm assuming that other people need to be connected still.

1346
01:19:28,869 --> 01:19:29,831
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're just going to get into it.

1347
01:19:30,492 --> 01:19:34,578
[SPEAKER_07]: Last week's winner, first song you can vote for tonight, Foggy, Come Into My Dream.

1348
01:19:34,638 --> 01:19:34,958
[SPEAKER_07]: Enjoy.

1349
01:20:40,514 --> 01:20:44,437
Thank you for watching.

1350
01:20:44,457 --> 01:20:45,517
See you next time.

1351
01:21:10,117 --> 01:21:23,377
[SPEAKER_04]: There were rainbows in the night You and me could fly And the ocean shined so bright And the ocean shined so bright

1352
01:22:08,635 --> 01:22:12,861
[SPEAKER_07]: That was a clip of song number one last week's winner, Foggy, with Come Into My Dream.

1353
01:22:12,982 --> 01:22:17,969
[SPEAKER_07]: Once again, since we're still having some bad connectivity problems, if...

1354
01:22:18,949 --> 01:22:44,354
[SPEAKER_07]: um... we don't get enough people in the chat room and please don't vote chat room you're on your honor tonight please don't vote unless you heard enough of the song where you think you can make an honest vote of all the three songs so if we don't get enough votes from the chat room we're going to vote in house so because of that i'm going to only ask for scores and feedback from the hosts on the next two songs usually we

1355
01:22:45,490 --> 01:22:52,674
[SPEAKER_07]: Usually we let the whole room comment on them, but, um, we're, usually, it's mine, go ahead.

1356
01:22:53,434 --> 01:22:58,216
[SPEAKER_07]: Usually we let the whole chatroom, or we let the whole room here comment and judge the songs on a scale of 1 to 10.

1357
01:22:58,436 --> 01:23:00,457
[SPEAKER_07]: We're not going to do that tonight because you guys may be voting.

1358
01:23:01,058 --> 01:23:02,378
[SPEAKER_07]: So, that's that.

1359
01:23:04,039 --> 01:23:07,301
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, uh, Jamie, why don't you introduce your song that you picked tonight?

1360
01:23:08,001 --> 01:23:12,283
[SPEAKER_03]: It's, um, I was looking for Jan Johnston songs, well, ones with her singing.

1361
01:23:13,368 --> 01:23:16,891
[SPEAKER_03]: and I found one by Freefall with her called Skydive.

1362
01:23:18,272 --> 01:23:19,333
[SPEAKER_03]: And I had it on repeat for a while.

1363
01:23:21,375 --> 01:23:25,739
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I think that I just had it on my playlist so I put it in there because I didn't really put any thought into it.

1364
01:23:28,442 --> 01:23:30,263
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, so you ready to hear it?

1365
01:23:31,264 --> 01:23:33,586
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah!

1366
01:23:33,666 --> 01:23:36,489
[SPEAKER_07]: It's Freefall featuring Jan Johnston with Skydive.

1367
01:24:41,074 --> 01:24:54,365
[SPEAKER_05]: The first moment before our first touch We know how long we have to hold each other And we've drowned in love, no such thing we need Now we're here, we have our own language

1368
01:25:20,425 --> 01:25:29,436
[SPEAKER_05]: I could skydive on the moon, sail the ocean, on my bed I could swim around, scream my name, take a nap, I'm afraid to run, run, run, to you.

1369
01:25:45,271 --> 01:25:47,113
Thank you for watching

1370
01:26:30,473 --> 01:26:32,502
Thank you for watching!

1371
01:28:21,503 --> 01:28:24,825
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft,

1372
01:29:07,918 --> 01:29:09,319
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, that was song number two tonight.

1373
01:29:09,359 --> 01:29:11,701
[SPEAKER_07]: Free Fall featuring Jan Johnston with Skydive.

1374
01:29:11,721 --> 01:29:13,743
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's go around and see what the hosts thought of that one.

1375
01:29:14,223 --> 01:29:14,584
[SPEAKER_07]: Jamie.

1376
01:29:15,064 --> 01:29:15,304
[SPEAKER_03]: Nine.

1377
01:29:16,205 --> 01:29:16,646
[SPEAKER_07]: No comments?

1378
01:29:17,286 --> 01:29:19,128
[SPEAKER_03]: No, nine as in the number, not German.

1379
01:29:21,169 --> 01:29:21,490
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki.

1380
01:29:22,951 --> 01:29:25,953
[SPEAKER_07]: It was okay, but I like some of the other ones that she does better.

1381
01:29:26,674 --> 01:29:28,336
[SPEAKER_07]: So I give it like an eight.

1382
01:29:29,938 --> 01:29:30,338
[SPEAKER_07]: I agree.

1383
01:29:31,078 --> 01:29:32,319
[SPEAKER_07]: Jan Johnson, great.

1384
01:29:32,499 --> 01:29:35,180
[SPEAKER_07]: Love that other one that Jamie brought about two months ago.

1385
01:29:35,300 --> 01:29:37,521
[SPEAKER_07]: That one, eh, okay.

1386
01:29:37,881 --> 01:29:41,462
[SPEAKER_07]: I think I'd be interested to hear more Janis Johnson stuff, but not necessarily that song.

1387
01:29:41,942 --> 01:29:43,223
[SPEAKER_07]: I give it a seven.

1388
01:29:43,683 --> 01:29:49,485
[SPEAKER_07]: Why don't I replace her, you know, replace Paula Terry with Jan Johnson?

1389
01:29:49,505 --> 01:29:50,706
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, that would be awesome.

1390
01:29:50,746 --> 01:29:51,686
[SPEAKER_07]: Good idea.

1391
01:29:51,766 --> 01:29:52,546
[SPEAKER_07]: Dear Konami.

1392
01:29:54,107 --> 01:29:54,387
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1393
01:29:55,910 --> 01:29:56,571
[SPEAKER_07]: So there you go.

1394
01:29:56,651 --> 01:29:59,812
[SPEAKER_07]: We would usually at this point go around and see what our other guests think.

1395
01:29:59,832 --> 01:30:00,753
[SPEAKER_03]: But we don't care what they think.

1396
01:30:00,773 --> 01:30:01,633
[SPEAKER_07]: But we don't care what they think.

1397
01:30:01,693 --> 01:30:01,813
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

1398
01:30:02,253 --> 01:30:02,434
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

1399
01:30:02,634 --> 01:30:03,574
[SPEAKER_07]: What did you pick today?

1400
01:30:04,895 --> 01:30:07,396
[SPEAKER_07]: I picked this one because, you know, whatever.

1401
01:30:07,616 --> 01:30:08,577
[SPEAKER_07]: I made it today.

1402
01:30:08,917 --> 01:30:10,278
[SPEAKER_07]: It's cool, I guess.

1403
01:30:10,458 --> 01:30:14,780
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the Fly, the 2003 Burst mix.

1404
01:30:15,060 --> 01:30:17,401
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just a Burst style, I should say.

1405
01:30:18,141 --> 01:30:23,204
[SPEAKER_07]: Blatantly ripping off of the, what was it, B-Rocku, you know, 1998 Burst style, so...

1406
01:30:25,805 --> 01:30:33,607
[SPEAKER_07]: It's The Fly, 2003, Burst Style, Loki vs. The Deep Project, and I'm sure you'll recognize some of the samples in there.

1407
01:30:33,868 --> 01:30:44,651
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, this was the song that they sampled another song that was in DDR Extreme and also was sampled in one of my remixes, so you'll probably recognize some of them.

1408
01:30:46,525 --> 01:30:49,209
[SPEAKER_07]: So in other words, it's another Loki remix, a new one.

1409
01:30:50,871 --> 01:30:55,318
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's about as remix as the Politary Orbit Tribe thing was.

1410
01:30:56,239 --> 01:30:57,461
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, well let's have a listen anyway.

1411
01:30:57,501 --> 01:31:01,286
[SPEAKER_07]: It's Loki vs. Deep Project with The Fly, 2003 mix.

1412
01:31:01,306 --> 01:31:02,428
[SPEAKER_07]: Here it is, song number three.

1413
01:33:56,725 --> 01:34:00,687
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, that was song number three, Loki vs. Deep Project with the Fly 2003 Burst Style.

1414
01:34:00,707 --> 01:34:00,987
[SPEAKER_07]: Jamie?

1415
01:34:01,527 --> 01:34:02,248
[SPEAKER_03]: It was cool, Abe.

1416
01:34:02,668 --> 01:34:04,329
[SPEAKER_03]: We're looking at the fake porn.

1417
01:34:04,829 --> 01:34:05,229
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki.

1418
01:34:06,790 --> 01:34:07,930
[SPEAKER_07]: Eh, it was okay.

1419
01:34:08,010 --> 01:34:18,275
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, we were listening in the studio here, and you can't really hear most of it gets drowned out just because the bass is too loud or something.

1420
01:34:18,775 --> 01:34:19,656
[SPEAKER_07]: Whatever, I don't care.

1421
01:34:19,736 --> 01:34:22,157
[SPEAKER_07]: I threw it together in like an hour.

1422
01:34:23,351 --> 01:34:24,972
[SPEAKER_07]: I care not, so whatever.

1423
01:34:26,133 --> 01:34:26,454
[SPEAKER_07]: Seven.

1424
01:34:26,474 --> 01:34:37,202
[SPEAKER_07]: I feel a little uneducated to make a vote because I'm not familiar enough with the original song, so I'm not sure how much it was actually remixed, but it sounded very much like a video game racing song.

1425
01:34:37,262 --> 01:34:38,023
[SPEAKER_07]: It was very good.

1426
01:34:38,063 --> 01:34:38,523
[SPEAKER_07]: I liked it.

1427
01:34:39,885 --> 01:34:44,028
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't... I thought you said you mixed it with Electro-Tune, but I don't hear it.

1428
01:34:44,388 --> 01:34:46,670
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if it's... Is it really sped up or something?

1429
01:34:48,331 --> 01:34:50,013
[SPEAKER_07]: Not really, but it has Electro-Tune in it.

1430
01:34:51,223 --> 01:34:52,084
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1431
01:35:10,998 --> 01:35:15,481
[SPEAKER_07]: I feel like I'm being forced to make remixes, so they're turning like crap.

1432
01:35:15,841 --> 01:35:18,442
[SPEAKER_07]: God damn it, why'd I have to make The Legend of Trance to begin with?

1433
01:35:18,503 --> 01:35:21,304
[SPEAKER_07]: Because now I have to live up to that, and that sucks.

1434
01:35:21,584 --> 01:35:23,846
[SPEAKER_03]: You still need to make the one that I asked for.

1435
01:35:24,846 --> 01:35:26,147
[SPEAKER_07]: Was that the Safari Trance one?

1436
01:35:26,367 --> 01:35:29,249
[SPEAKER_03]: No, the Safari Trance one just won't work because no one's that talented.

1437
01:35:29,689 --> 01:35:30,850
[SPEAKER_07]: Well then what's the one you wanted to hear?

1438
01:35:30,870 --> 01:35:34,692
[SPEAKER_03]: The one with, um, uh, what was that?

1439
01:35:34,852 --> 01:35:35,433
[SPEAKER_03]: Release Your Mind.

1440
01:35:36,633 --> 01:35:36,753
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh.

1441
01:35:37,934 --> 01:35:38,875
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it has to be TACC.

1442
01:35:40,379 --> 01:35:42,844
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright guys, it's time to vote, chat room.

1443
01:35:43,325 --> 01:35:48,575
[SPEAKER_07]: If I don't get at least five votes, and please don't vote unless you feel like you heard enough of each song to make a decent vote.

1444
01:35:50,148 --> 01:35:56,090
[SPEAKER_07]: If we don't get five votes in the chat room, the real room here, the live room will vote instead.

1445
01:35:56,230 --> 01:35:59,591
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's why we haven't heard what the guests think of the song chat because they may vote on them.

1446
01:36:00,132 --> 01:36:02,232
[SPEAKER_07]: So let's hear a little recap.

1447
01:36:02,272 --> 01:36:06,554
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to play a little bit extended recaps than I usually do because of the buffering issues.

1448
01:36:06,954 --> 01:36:10,435
[SPEAKER_07]: And so you guys all have a chance to listen one more time because I know you are, right?

1449
01:36:10,515 --> 01:36:10,815
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1450
01:36:11,536 --> 01:36:12,196
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, exactly.

1451
01:36:13,308 --> 01:36:17,295
[SPEAKER_07]: So, a little bit of extended clips here, but just enough so you can get an idea of what's going on.

1452
01:36:17,635 --> 01:36:18,016
[SPEAKER_07]: Here we go.

1453
01:36:18,096 --> 01:36:22,142
[SPEAKER_07]: First up, last week's winner, song number one, Foggy, Come Into My Dream.

1454
01:36:54,941 --> 01:36:59,245
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, song number two, Free Fall, featuring Jan Johnston with Skydive.

1455
01:36:59,705 --> 01:37:00,226
[SPEAKER_07]: Here it is.

1456
01:37:02,107 --> 01:37:03,849
Free Fall

1457
01:37:34,386 --> 01:37:39,137
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, song number three you can vote for tonight is Loki vs. Deep Project with the Fly 2003 mix.

1458
01:38:08,555 --> 01:38:17,066
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, so those of you in the room, go ahead and write it down on the paper, the one you want to vote for, and fold your paper in half, and then we'll look at them in a little bit.

1459
01:38:18,768 --> 01:38:22,413
[SPEAKER_07]: Otherwise, chat room, if you guys were able to follow us, place votes now.

1460
01:38:26,348 --> 01:38:28,029
[SPEAKER_07]: over a private message to Sky in the chatroom.

1461
01:38:28,950 --> 01:38:37,915
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyways, you wanted me to mention this because I mentioned this the other day, and because it's also one of the songs I sampled, which I might add was not very remixed, but it, whatever.

1462
01:38:38,255 --> 01:38:40,517
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I added, like, a better drum beat to it, and that's it.

1463
01:38:40,737 --> 01:38:41,297
[SPEAKER_07]: Whoop-dee-doo.

1464
01:38:41,757 --> 01:38:52,324
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyways, so anyways, I was going to mention that F-Zero GX has three songs that sample the song, or actually three songs that are remixes of the song The Fly by The Deep Project.

1465
01:38:53,465 --> 01:39:00,360
[SPEAKER_07]: Which also, you might remember, was also sampled in The Legend of Max Which, shut up

1466
01:39:00,882 --> 01:39:02,482
[SPEAKER_07]: You're not even on mic, so shut up.

1467
01:39:02,943 --> 01:39:03,263
[SPEAKER_07]: Shut up.

1468
01:39:03,703 --> 01:39:03,943
[SPEAKER_07]: Shut up.

1469
01:39:04,023 --> 01:39:04,523
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, anyways.

1470
01:39:04,903 --> 01:39:08,604
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I was going to play clips from the three songs.

1471
01:39:09,545 --> 01:39:10,025
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see here.

1472
01:39:10,065 --> 01:39:18,427
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's start off with the first one, which was... Basically, these are all the character music for the characters in F-Zero GX.

1473
01:39:18,828 --> 01:39:22,309
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll start off with Deathborn, which is one of the characters.

1474
01:39:22,729 --> 01:39:25,710
[SPEAKER_07]: We've played this for my... Let's see, anyways.

1475
01:39:27,530 --> 01:39:29,891
[SPEAKER_07]: Why did not Louie... Okay, here we go.

1476
01:39:34,264 --> 01:39:42,050
[SPEAKER_07]: Deathborn, that's a remix of a fly, believe it or not, which is kind of neat.

1477
01:39:42,110 --> 01:39:49,215
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we've also got Blood Falcons theme, which was the one that I remixed, barely.

1478
01:39:51,277 --> 01:39:52,077
[SPEAKER_07]: I know it sucked.

1479
01:39:54,459 --> 01:39:57,962
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's probably a lot better without the crap they threw on top of it.

1480
01:39:59,107 --> 01:40:00,467
[SPEAKER_07]: But anyways, that's Blood Falcon's theme.

1481
01:40:00,507 --> 01:40:03,809
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we have Black Shadow's theme, which I wanted the remix, but it just didn't work.

1482
01:40:04,409 --> 01:40:17,353
[SPEAKER_07]: So, um... Anyways, I just thought I'd mention that, because that was kind of neat.

1483
01:40:18,954 --> 01:40:19,314
[SPEAKER_07]: Whatever.

1484
01:40:20,734 --> 01:40:22,615
[SPEAKER_07]: F-Zero rocks, because it's fast.

1485
01:40:23,675 --> 01:40:27,717
[SPEAKER_07]: But, um... Yeah, I admit, I know that... I knew full, uh...

1486
01:40:29,338 --> 01:40:35,280
[SPEAKER_07]: I knew from the get-go that that remix wasn't that great, and I was going to throw it in there anyways, because I just didn't care.

1487
01:40:37,121 --> 01:40:39,482
[SPEAKER_07]: Be glad I didn't choose the chicken dance or something like that.

1488
01:40:41,543 --> 01:40:41,963
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, Rob.

1489
01:40:42,523 --> 01:40:42,744
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

1490
01:40:42,984 --> 01:40:43,984
[SPEAKER_03]: Speaking of the chicken dance.

1491
01:40:44,704 --> 01:40:44,884
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1492
01:40:44,904 --> 01:40:47,445
[SPEAKER_03]: You should play that for the pre-show and during the break.

1493
01:40:48,506 --> 01:40:48,646
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1494
01:40:48,726 --> 01:40:50,107
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm standing there just for our chat room.

1495
01:40:50,127 --> 01:40:53,128
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, the chat room can't really hear tonight.

1496
01:40:54,068 --> 01:40:54,548
[SPEAKER_03]: Too bad.

1497
01:40:55,149 --> 01:40:56,269
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll be on the... The replay.

1498
01:40:56,309 --> 01:40:58,330
[SPEAKER_03]: The replay.

1499
01:41:00,228 --> 01:41:06,813
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, I only got one vote for Cage Match from the chat room, so I think we're going to go ahead and reveal the winner here, okay?

1500
01:41:07,654 --> 01:41:09,255
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, I'm interested in your votes.

1501
01:41:09,275 --> 01:41:11,656
[SPEAKER_07]: Here we go, everybody got them, I got five, so here we go.

1502
01:41:15,499 --> 01:41:16,340
[SPEAKER_03]: Who is the winner?

1503
01:41:18,522 --> 01:41:19,762
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't juggle the ferrets!

1504
01:41:19,903 --> 01:41:25,687
[SPEAKER_07]: I wish I had the Survivor Tribal Council song here, but I don't have it, so I've got to find another song to fill in here.

1505
01:41:27,608 --> 01:41:28,628
[SPEAKER_03]: Play the chicken dance, Rob.

1506
01:41:30,429 --> 01:41:31,489
[SPEAKER_03]: There's neighbors out there.

1507
01:41:36,151 --> 01:41:37,231
[SPEAKER_07]: I got something even better.

1508
01:41:39,072 --> 01:41:39,452
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1509
01:41:39,472 --> 01:41:39,932
[SPEAKER_03]: Match game.

1510
01:41:40,572 --> 01:41:41,073
[SPEAKER_07]: Here he goes.

1511
01:41:41,553 --> 01:41:42,213
[SPEAKER_07]: First vote.

1512
01:41:42,633 --> 01:41:44,174
[SPEAKER_03]: 70s porn, fabulous.

1513
01:41:45,874 --> 01:41:48,115
[SPEAKER_07]: The first vote is for whatever Loki's was called.

1514
01:41:49,596 --> 01:41:50,816
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's song number three.

1515
01:41:55,838 --> 01:41:56,338
[SPEAKER_07]: Next vote.

1516
01:41:59,710 --> 01:42:04,554
[SPEAKER_07]: Second song, the one that wasn't Foggy or Loki, so one vote for second song, one vote for third song.

1517
01:42:08,957 --> 01:42:13,921
[SPEAKER_07]: It can't be a tie with five people, impossible, unless somebody didn't write a vote.

1518
01:42:15,282 --> 01:42:18,745
[SPEAKER_07]: Song number three, so Loki's song has two votes, Jamie's song has one vote.

1519
01:42:26,493 --> 01:42:29,015
[SPEAKER_07]: Ah, here's a vote for song one, coming to my dreams.

1520
01:42:29,075 --> 01:42:34,078
[SPEAKER_07]: So now we have one vote for song one, one vote for song two, and two votes for song three.

1521
01:42:34,238 --> 01:42:36,240
[SPEAKER_03]: It is possible to have a tie with five votes.

1522
01:42:36,540 --> 01:42:36,700
[SPEAKER_03]: It is.

1523
01:42:36,720 --> 01:42:37,461
[SPEAKER_03]: Two and two and one.

1524
01:42:37,701 --> 01:42:43,264
[SPEAKER_07]: Right, we might have a tie right here, but that's okay because remember, in case of a tie, the host picks.

1525
01:42:43,785 --> 01:42:45,006
[SPEAKER_07]: The host who didn't get picks.

1526
01:42:45,366 --> 01:42:46,527
[SPEAKER_07]: So here it is, the last vote.

1527
01:42:47,607 --> 01:42:49,849
[SPEAKER_07]: So if it's a vote for song three, song three wins.

1528
01:42:49,889 --> 01:42:52,531
[SPEAKER_07]: If it's a vote for song one or two, we have a tie.

1529
01:42:52,671 --> 01:42:52,911
[SPEAKER_07]: Ready?

1530
01:42:56,865 --> 01:42:59,627
[SPEAKER_07]: Ah, it's a vote for song number one.

1531
01:43:00,448 --> 01:43:06,453
[SPEAKER_07]: So, we have a tie between Foggy and Loki's pick, song number three.

1532
01:43:06,613 --> 01:43:09,075
[SPEAKER_07]: So, Jamie... Who should I vote for?

1533
01:43:09,095 --> 01:43:09,175
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

1534
01:43:09,575 --> 01:43:10,576
[SPEAKER_02]: Who should I vote for?

1535
01:43:10,636 --> 01:43:11,737
[SPEAKER_07]: Who should you vote for?

1536
01:43:11,757 --> 01:43:12,477
[SPEAKER_02]: Harwick!

1537
01:43:14,539 --> 01:43:17,941
[SPEAKER_07]: Marin tried to send a vote in for... I am getting some votes from the chat room.

1538
01:43:17,961 --> 01:43:18,442
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you want to hear?

1539
01:43:18,482 --> 01:43:18,902
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you want to hear?

1540
01:43:18,922 --> 01:43:19,363
[SPEAKER_07]: Add them in.

1541
01:43:19,383 --> 01:43:20,383
[SPEAKER_07]: Add them in?

1542
01:43:20,724 --> 01:43:21,524
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, this is what's interesting.

1543
01:43:21,544 --> 01:43:22,285
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, we're going to add them in.

1544
01:43:25,004 --> 01:43:27,066
[SPEAKER_13]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1545
01:43:51,638 --> 01:43:53,019
[SPEAKER_07]: voted for song number two.

1546
01:43:53,139 --> 01:43:55,641
[SPEAKER_07]: So now we have a tie between song number two and Actdeft.

1547
01:43:57,142 --> 01:43:57,722
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's it.

1548
01:43:57,762 --> 01:43:59,023
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't won in a long time.

1549
01:44:02,726 --> 01:44:04,126
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, oh, that means I have to pick?

1550
01:44:05,928 --> 01:44:07,249
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, I...

1551
01:44:13,410 --> 01:44:14,551
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a tough decision.

1552
01:44:14,591 --> 01:44:15,592
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a tough decision.

1553
01:44:15,612 --> 01:44:16,252
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll tell you why.

1554
01:44:16,353 --> 01:44:17,714
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll tell you why this is a tough decision.

1555
01:44:17,994 --> 01:44:19,876
[SPEAKER_07]: Because Jamie hasn't won in a little while.

1556
01:44:20,076 --> 01:44:22,698
[SPEAKER_07]: I've actually been winning the cage match lately, so she hasn't won in a while.

1557
01:44:22,718 --> 01:44:24,700
[SPEAKER_07]: So I kind of feel bad, so I'm like, okay, maybe we should let Jamie win.

1558
01:44:24,920 --> 01:44:25,741
[SPEAKER_07]: And I did like her song.

1559
01:44:26,894 --> 01:44:30,116
[SPEAKER_07]: On the other hand, Loki put a lot of work into his song.

1560
01:44:30,176 --> 01:44:33,718
[SPEAKER_07]: Jamie just gets a song from the internet, but Loki made his.

1561
01:44:33,738 --> 01:44:37,120
[SPEAKER_07]: If you want to feel better, I didn't put that much effort into that.

1562
01:44:37,220 --> 01:44:38,061
[SPEAKER_07]: Really, I did not.

1563
01:44:38,221 --> 01:44:43,084
[SPEAKER_03]: It's better than what I... The song I picked, though, I was going to pick the Chicken Dance Techno Mix.

1564
01:44:43,464 --> 01:44:43,985
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, God.

1565
01:44:44,265 --> 01:44:45,866
[SPEAKER_07]: I would have voted for that, no problem.

1566
01:44:46,786 --> 01:44:46,806
[SPEAKER_07]: I...

1567
01:44:48,027 --> 01:44:49,268
[SPEAKER_07]: I have a happy alternative.

1568
01:44:49,308 --> 01:44:54,272
[SPEAKER_07]: How about we just take the song that I sampled for the Fly remix, since it's better anyways.

1569
01:44:54,572 --> 01:44:57,894
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a lot cleaner, doesn't have the loud drumbeat over the top of it.

1570
01:44:58,194 --> 01:44:59,495
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll use that instead of mine.

1571
01:45:00,136 --> 01:45:00,296
[SPEAKER_07]: Huh?

1572
01:45:00,376 --> 01:45:00,596
[SPEAKER_07]: Huh?

1573
01:45:00,656 --> 01:45:00,996
[SPEAKER_07]: Huh?

1574
01:45:01,056 --> 01:45:01,296
[SPEAKER_07]: Huh?

1575
01:45:03,078 --> 01:45:06,280
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm thinking, I'm thinking I'm going to give it to Jamie tonight.

1576
01:45:08,922 --> 01:45:09,702
[SPEAKER_07]: So there you go.

1577
01:45:09,762 --> 01:45:10,303
[SPEAKER_03]: Where's the ferret?

1578
01:45:10,383 --> 01:45:11,263
[SPEAKER_03]: I need to help the ferret.

1579
01:45:12,304 --> 01:45:13,205
[SPEAKER_03]: The ferret, she needs to help.

1580
01:45:13,265 --> 01:45:14,826
[SPEAKER_03]: She said she needs to help the ferret.

1581
01:45:15,322 --> 01:45:15,802
[SPEAKER_07]: I heard it.

1582
01:45:15,842 --> 01:45:17,422
[SPEAKER_07]: She said she needed to hump the ferret.

1583
01:45:21,383 --> 01:45:24,004
[SPEAKER_03]: If you do, I will, um, beat you with the ferret.

1584
01:45:24,064 --> 01:45:27,785
[SPEAKER_03]: Wait, what was that one that I said the other week that you said you haven't before?

1585
01:45:28,605 --> 01:45:36,046
[SPEAKER_07]: There was something that last week or something that I said that, um, was, you know, bad or something.

1586
01:45:40,187 --> 01:45:40,607
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

1587
01:45:40,787 --> 01:45:41,728
[SPEAKER_03]: Have a conversation.

1588
01:45:42,208 --> 01:45:43,708
[SPEAKER_03]: And now we let the ferrets talk to you.

1589
01:45:55,959 --> 01:45:59,542
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, so there's the cage match, kind of a little bit fucked up.

1590
01:46:11,690 --> 01:46:15,413
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, I think, um, what do I talk about now?

1591
01:46:16,334 --> 01:46:19,116
[SPEAKER_07]: Isn't there actually some Bimani news going on right now?

1592
01:46:19,336 --> 01:46:19,616
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

1593
01:46:20,397 --> 01:46:20,957
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, there is.

1594
01:46:21,057 --> 01:46:23,219
[SPEAKER_07]: I think Loki has something he wants to share with you all.

1595
01:46:24,468 --> 01:46:25,168
[SPEAKER_03]: People still play that?

1596
01:46:25,188 --> 01:46:25,849
[SPEAKER_03]: The money crap?

1597
01:46:27,089 --> 01:46:27,930
[SPEAKER_07]: The modem's up.

1598
01:46:53,087 --> 01:46:54,288
[SPEAKER_07]: I know, I was just being slow.

1599
01:46:54,489 --> 01:47:02,397
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyways, there was, of course, they were showing off DDR Extreme, which we pretty much know is going to be exactly like Max 2 is right now.

1600
01:47:02,437 --> 01:47:02,898
[SPEAKER_07]: What are you doing?

1601
01:47:05,236 --> 01:47:06,637
[SPEAKER_07]: Party, Party Maker

1602
01:47:26,926 --> 01:47:43,100
[SPEAKER_07]: Party Mix, I guess, uh, Dance Dance Revolution, um, Party Mix or something like that, let's see, I don't know, where'd it go, I just saw the link to this, um, where did Dark Tipsy get posted, there it is,

1603
01:47:44,986 --> 01:47:47,528
[SPEAKER_07]: It's Dance Dance Revolution Party Collection.

1604
01:47:48,308 --> 01:47:51,431
[SPEAKER_07]: In other words, I think it's Dance Dance Revolution Best Hits number two.

1605
01:47:53,072 --> 01:47:57,555
[SPEAKER_07]: And you're pretty much going to have, you know, it looks like it's going to be based off the DDR Extreme Engine.

1606
01:47:57,575 --> 01:48:03,359
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, they don't really show anything other than diet mode and, you know, standard beginner stuff.

1607
01:48:03,379 --> 01:48:06,661
[SPEAKER_07]: So, it has beginner and diet mode.

1608
01:48:07,742 --> 01:48:12,446
[SPEAKER_07]: Other than that, no, obviously, there's going to be, you know, DDR Max coming out next...

1609
01:48:13,519 --> 01:48:14,260
[SPEAKER_07]: and so on.

1610
01:48:22,614 --> 01:48:22,894
[SPEAKER_07]: What else?

1611
01:48:23,235 --> 01:48:38,750
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah, we've also got, kind of segueing into sim news, Step Mania is at 3.9 alpha 5, and so one thing that's fully supported now is the dance magic mode.

1612
01:48:39,070 --> 01:48:40,531
[SPEAKER_07]: That's fully supported now.

1613
01:48:41,452 --> 01:48:42,573
[SPEAKER_07]: It works, it's done.

1614
01:48:45,057 --> 01:48:52,036
[SPEAKER_07]: Another thing I thought I'd mention, because a lot of sim sites are down, and you can't find your sim file.

1615
01:48:55,504 --> 01:49:16,431
[SPEAKER_07]: But now you can go find all your official sim files at www.ddramerica.com slash bttracker and you'll have all your torrents for every single batch collection of files that was featured on DDRUK.

1616
01:49:18,472 --> 01:49:19,313
[SPEAKER_07]: Go check them out.

1617
01:49:19,333 --> 01:49:21,154
[SPEAKER_07]: They've got tons of stuff.

1618
01:49:21,474 --> 01:49:22,034
[SPEAKER_07]: Everything.

1619
01:49:22,295 --> 01:49:23,736
[SPEAKER_07]: All your official stuff.

1620
01:49:24,196 --> 01:49:26,237
[SPEAKER_07]: I pissed my pants when I saw this site.

1621
01:49:27,138 --> 01:49:29,639
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't because I already had all of it years ago.

1622
01:49:30,119 --> 01:49:31,200
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, good for you.

1623
01:49:32,301 --> 01:49:34,602
[SPEAKER_07]: They just made so many for the Mac work finally.

1624
01:49:34,882 --> 01:49:37,584
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm a little behind, thank you very much.

1625
01:49:39,565 --> 01:49:41,066
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, the Mac's always behind.

1626
01:49:44,691 --> 01:49:46,952
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyways... One second, go!

1627
01:49:48,112 --> 01:49:48,773
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, got it.

1628
01:49:49,553 --> 01:49:50,954
[SPEAKER_11]: Ferret tail sack on the cab.

1629
01:49:52,954 --> 01:49:54,135
[SPEAKER_07]: Hot ferret action!

1630
01:49:54,315 --> 01:50:00,057
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that's pretty much that, and, um... In other news, my cabinet's coming along quite nicely.

1631
01:50:01,198 --> 01:50:02,118
[SPEAKER_07]: That's it, yeah.

1632
01:50:02,778 --> 01:50:04,039
[SPEAKER_07]: That's all your boomani news.

1633
01:50:04,479 --> 01:50:12,482
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, and, um... Yeah, TAC did something, and... And, uh... And Jamie perks up like a cat.

1634
01:50:14,956 --> 01:50:15,756
[SPEAKER_03]: What did my man do?

1635
01:50:16,056 --> 01:50:17,117
[SPEAKER_03]: I still had to marry him, you know.

1636
01:50:18,018 --> 01:50:20,020
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, actually, I was going to mention this.

1637
01:50:21,921 --> 01:50:23,642
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm trying to remember where I saw it.

1638
01:50:23,743 --> 01:50:24,943
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it was Bomani Style.

1639
01:50:25,124 --> 01:50:26,164
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I say Bomani Style.

1640
01:50:27,966 --> 01:50:29,367
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks, I forgot about that.

1641
01:50:29,987 --> 01:50:32,930
[SPEAKER_07]: F you to Bomani Style for putting music on your front page.

1642
01:50:33,010 --> 01:50:33,831
[SPEAKER_07]: You suck.

1643
01:50:34,731 --> 01:50:35,712
[SPEAKER_07]: What are you thinking?

1644
01:50:36,132 --> 01:50:40,076
[SPEAKER_07]: Seriously, okay, now, we really, really like Bomani Style.

1645
01:50:40,116 --> 01:50:41,497
[SPEAKER_07]: We do, Loki, we do.

1646
01:50:42,268 --> 01:50:42,388
[SPEAKER_07]: TAC?

1647
01:50:42,408 --> 01:50:42,508
[SPEAKER_07]: TAC?

1648
01:51:13,067 --> 01:51:14,028
[SPEAKER_07]: on, uh, yeah.

1649
01:51:14,328 --> 01:51:26,201
[SPEAKER_07]: So, but anyways, I was gonna say that, um, there's that, um, what was it, that Beatmania concert live thingy, 2DX, yeah, 2DX Secret Concert.

1650
01:51:27,105 --> 01:51:28,225
[SPEAKER_07]: Super Secret Concert.

1651
01:51:28,345 --> 01:51:36,388
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyways, that was going on, and supposedly there was some new songs brought out for that.

1652
01:51:36,768 --> 01:51:38,608
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm trying to see if I can pull this up here.

1653
01:51:38,628 --> 01:51:42,930
[SPEAKER_07]: I just want to say really quickly, because Jamie's going, what, huh?

1654
01:51:43,350 --> 01:51:50,092
[SPEAKER_07]: If you actually read, there's a big, long post on Mamadi Style where they talked about where they're taking down the media, and basically...

1655
01:51:50,672 --> 01:52:03,643
[SPEAKER_07]: Most people kind of know by now that read the forums frequently of Imani Style that TAC has been in touch with the people that run ImaniStyle.com and that they were going to try and find a way to distribute Bounce Connected in the U.S.

1656
01:52:03,743 --> 01:52:05,164
[SPEAKER_07]: through ImaniStyle.com.

1657
01:52:06,025 --> 01:52:18,095
[SPEAKER_07]: And somehow along the way, though, it's kind of been inferred, and I haven't seen a confirmation in this thread of this or whatever, but somehow it got around that TAC actually asked that the media be stopped.

1658
01:52:18,775 --> 01:52:19,036
[SPEAKER_07]: So...

1659
01:52:20,003 --> 01:52:27,389
[SPEAKER_07]: Which is interesting because I had also heard that he didn't mind so much because he was excited that people outside of Japan liked his music so much.

1660
01:52:27,869 --> 01:52:29,451
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I don't know.

1661
01:52:30,412 --> 01:52:32,513
[SPEAKER_03]: And he's actually planning on having a real release over here.

1662
01:52:32,874 --> 01:52:35,496
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it could be a combination of things though.

1663
01:52:35,636 --> 01:52:40,200
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, if you look in this thread, you read a lot about bandwidth whores and things like that.

1664
01:52:40,240 --> 01:52:42,581
[SPEAKER_07]: People that just leech all day long and stuff.

1665
01:52:42,621 --> 01:52:47,926
[SPEAKER_07]: And they kind of want to explore other parts of what they could do with a money style other than just being a leech that he plays.

1666
01:52:48,526 --> 01:52:49,167
[SPEAKER_03]: That makes sense.

1667
01:52:49,467 --> 01:52:54,970
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyways, I was going to say that the 2DX Secret Live Party performances, here is the playlist for the performances.

1668
01:52:55,470 --> 01:53:05,917
[SPEAKER_07]: You had set one, which is by Tack, and he did Abstract, Electro-Tunes, Schlagwerk, Stoic, Holic, DXY, Quasar, and Traces, so that was kind of neat.

1669
01:53:06,117 --> 01:53:06,177
[SPEAKER_07]: Aww.

1670
01:53:06,617 --> 01:53:12,742
[SPEAKER_07]: And then you have Slake was set 2, did Breeding, Music to Your Head, and a new song which is untitled right now.

1671
01:53:13,823 --> 01:53:21,950
[SPEAKER_07]: Set 3 was done by Wack, which did Linus, Spica, Over the Clouds, and Regulus, Make a Difference, Murmur Twins, Linus, and Moonchild.

1672
01:53:22,671 --> 01:53:26,013
[SPEAKER_07]: And then Akira Yamaoka did...

1673
01:53:27,074 --> 01:53:28,434
[SPEAKER_12]: I would have wet my panties

1674
01:53:56,880 --> 01:54:04,843
[SPEAKER_07]: Tomorrow's Perfume, Colors, Pandora, the new song by DJ Taka, Motion 2003, and Rainbow Flyer, the vocal version.

1675
01:54:04,963 --> 01:54:09,205
[SPEAKER_07]: So that was kind of neat, and hopefully we'll get MP3s of those new songs soon.

1676
01:54:09,325 --> 01:54:14,547
[SPEAKER_07]: And the vocal version of Rainbow Flyer was actually not done by Sana, it was done by Noria, was actually there.

1677
01:54:14,647 --> 01:54:20,209
[SPEAKER_07]: Noria being the one that did Glorious Days and the Happy Handbag song in Einstein, I can't remember what the hell it's called.

1678
01:54:21,465 --> 01:54:34,788
[SPEAKER_07]: and Platonic XXX is supposed to sound like a Japanese version of Secret Rendezvous with rapping.

1679
01:54:34,808 --> 01:54:35,928
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

1680
01:54:36,828 --> 01:54:37,048
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1681
01:54:38,528 --> 01:54:39,049
[SPEAKER_07]: With rapping.

1682
01:54:39,329 --> 01:54:41,849
[SPEAKER_07]: So I know that means it's probably going to be in the next DDR, so I mean, that's kind of cool.

1683
01:54:41,869 --> 01:54:44,770
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if that's a bad thing.

1684
01:54:44,790 --> 01:54:45,790
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it's not bad.

1685
01:54:45,810 --> 01:54:46,510
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it's

1686
01:54:48,351 --> 01:54:49,171
[SPEAKER_07]: Sylvia Drive.

1687
01:54:49,452 --> 01:54:50,572
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what I was trying to think of.

1688
01:54:50,592 --> 01:54:51,652
[SPEAKER_07]: Sylvia Drive.

1689
01:54:51,693 --> 01:54:52,513
[SPEAKER_07]: I love that.

1690
01:54:53,133 --> 01:54:57,595
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a great signature right there.

1691
01:54:58,696 --> 01:55:01,317
[SPEAKER_07]: Nigga stole my bike.

1692
01:55:03,858 --> 01:55:04,118
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry.

1693
01:55:05,719 --> 01:55:07,039
[SPEAKER_07]: It's from Mike Tyson's punchline.

1694
01:55:07,079 --> 01:55:07,920
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, no, no, no.

1695
01:55:08,400 --> 01:55:09,200
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what it was.

1696
01:55:09,880 --> 01:55:11,401
[SPEAKER_07]: It wasn't Lion Suki in the other song.

1697
01:55:11,421 --> 01:55:14,062
[SPEAKER_07]: It was Lion Suki in the theme to Metal Gear Solid.

1698
01:55:14,082 --> 01:55:15,243
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yeah, that's right, that's right, that's right.

1699
01:55:16,283 --> 01:55:17,584
[SPEAKER_07]: Which I would love...

1700
01:55:20,342 --> 01:55:22,964
[SPEAKER_07]: Where did God, you guys, try to kill me?

1701
01:55:23,484 --> 01:55:24,444
[SPEAKER_12]: It's your fault, Loki.

1702
01:55:24,464 --> 01:55:27,326
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not my fault because you keep walking around me.

1703
01:55:40,094 --> 01:55:46,217
[SPEAKER_07]: The switch is supposed to stay on on the microphone and the far microphone is supposed to stay far away and the close microphone is supposed to stay close.

1704
01:55:48,539 --> 01:55:48,719
[SPEAKER_07]: Give me...

1705
01:55:52,990 --> 01:55:54,490
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, Ritz.

1706
01:55:55,431 --> 01:55:56,571
[SPEAKER_07]: Ritz are mine.

1707
01:55:57,691 --> 01:55:58,292
[SPEAKER_07]: God damn it.

1708
01:55:58,332 --> 01:55:59,392
[SPEAKER_07]: I want Nilla Wafers now.

1709
01:56:01,873 --> 01:56:04,073
[SPEAKER_07]: And you get like two and a half crackers.

1710
01:56:04,113 --> 01:56:06,154
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, this will do nicely.

1711
01:56:06,434 --> 01:56:07,774
[SPEAKER_11]: And Eric can have the empty box.

1712
01:56:08,354 --> 01:56:09,775
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah, you know you like it.

1713
01:56:14,036 --> 01:56:15,056
[SPEAKER_07]: Snap into a Ritz.

1714
01:56:17,757 --> 01:56:19,477
[SPEAKER_07]: F you the Pringles, because they suck.

1715
01:56:20,078 --> 01:56:21,038
[SPEAKER_07]: It tastes like crap.

1716
01:56:22,823 --> 01:56:24,023
[SPEAKER_07]: The original Pringles suck.

1717
01:56:24,283 --> 01:56:24,644
[SPEAKER_07]: No, no, no.

1718
01:56:25,004 --> 01:56:28,865
[SPEAKER_07]: The original Pringles, Pringles now, Pringles in the future will all suck.

1719
01:56:30,365 --> 01:56:34,566
[SPEAKER_07]: And FD the Lays for trying to copy Pringles and put their stuff in a can.

1720
01:56:34,786 --> 01:56:37,487
[SPEAKER_07]: That's because you put your chippies in a can, it does not make them any better.

1721
01:56:37,567 --> 01:56:38,407
[SPEAKER_07]: Pringles.

1722
01:56:38,527 --> 01:56:40,267
[SPEAKER_07]: And what is up with Pib Extra?

1723
01:56:40,547 --> 01:56:42,028
[SPEAKER_07]: What is extra about Pib Extra?

1724
01:56:42,088 --> 01:56:43,528
[SPEAKER_07]: It tastes exactly the same.

1725
01:56:43,808 --> 01:56:44,588
[SPEAKER_07]: I have no idea.

1726
01:56:52,079 --> 01:57:07,413
[SPEAKER_07]: BasicPhysicsAaron, Ling, Box, FerretBow Insert Ferret into Ritzbox Insert Ferret towards end of Ritzbox Fling Ritzbox, Ferret flies Are we done about news?

1727
01:57:08,294 --> 01:57:13,920
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm done I'm thinking you guys What do you guys think about just make Where'd Jamie go?

1728
01:57:14,966 --> 01:57:17,068
[SPEAKER_07]: What are you guys thinking about just making it a two hour show tonight?

1729
01:57:18,008 --> 01:57:18,689
[SPEAKER_07]: Just like old days.

1730
01:57:19,850 --> 01:57:26,495
[SPEAKER_07]: Because we have no listeners, we're pretty much done with a lot of our topics, can't really interact with the chat room tonight, so.

1731
01:57:27,295 --> 01:57:30,077
[SPEAKER_07]: We're pretty much dead in the water, and we can all thank Comcast for that.

1732
01:57:30,458 --> 01:57:30,798
[SPEAKER_07]: Cunts.

1733
01:57:31,934 --> 01:57:35,556
[SPEAKER_07]: No listeners, huh?

1734
01:57:35,776 --> 01:57:36,737
[SPEAKER_07]: Not very many listeners?

1735
01:57:36,817 --> 01:57:46,723
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I mean, no, we have... God bless the chatroom, they're trying to get in, they're hammering to get in, they're just trying their best to... Stop ramming the stream!

1736
01:57:47,824 --> 01:57:51,066
[SPEAKER_07]: Everyone give a fuck you to Live365 for this sucking.

1737
01:57:51,226 --> 01:57:56,549
[SPEAKER_07]: No, no, no, it's not Live365, it's Comcast and Live365's link is fucked up.

1738
01:57:57,690 --> 01:57:59,571
[SPEAKER_07]: So, it's more Comcast's fault.

1739
01:58:00,609 --> 01:58:02,691
[SPEAKER_07]: Live 365 should be over the handle being hammered.

1740
01:58:03,151 --> 01:58:09,476
[SPEAKER_07]: They're a freaking internet radio station that hosts thousands and thousands of internet radio channels.

1741
01:58:09,496 --> 01:58:09,977
[SPEAKER_07]: What are you doing?

1742
01:58:10,117 --> 01:58:12,179
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, they're playing with my erotic poetry.

1743
01:58:12,259 --> 01:58:13,239
[SPEAKER_07]: Jamie's reading erotic poetry.

1744
01:58:14,741 --> 01:58:17,923
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm going to go around at this time and get everyone's final thoughts.

1745
01:58:18,884 --> 01:58:20,666
[SPEAKER_07]: Dude, read the erotic poetry.

1746
01:58:20,686 --> 01:58:21,786
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, read the erotic poetry first.

1747
01:58:23,988 --> 01:58:28,212
[SPEAKER_03]: So Jamie has written, your vagina breath blows.

1748
01:58:29,637 --> 01:58:32,559
[SPEAKER_03]: I have written, you suck enormous cock.

1749
01:58:34,039 --> 01:58:36,601
[SPEAKER_03]: And now we're waiting for Jamie to do another thing.

1750
01:58:37,221 --> 01:58:42,984
[SPEAKER_07]: My girlfriend wrote, and this is, let me, um, this, a dirty dog's, um, hey, what happened?

1751
01:58:45,025 --> 01:58:45,966
[SPEAKER_07]: You took enormous cock.

1752
01:58:45,986 --> 01:58:49,028
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, a dirty dog's enormous cock plunged into my ass.

1753
01:58:49,088 --> 01:58:51,409
[SPEAKER_07]: I swallowed his wiggling shaft, smeared...

1754
01:58:53,882 --> 01:58:57,504
[SPEAKER_07]: and smeared his pudding on my pink pussy.

1755
01:58:58,284 --> 01:58:59,204
[SPEAKER_07]: Your vagina blows.

1756
01:58:59,265 --> 01:59:01,846
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, that doesn't make any sense now because there's stuff being removed.

1757
01:59:04,547 --> 01:59:06,648
[SPEAKER_07]: Then I put velvet jelly love juice.

1758
01:59:09,850 --> 01:59:10,190
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

1759
01:59:10,910 --> 01:59:12,731
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's get final thoughts.

1760
01:59:12,751 --> 01:59:17,114
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to start today with I'll start final thoughts with Andrew.

1761
01:59:20,735 --> 01:59:21,816
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't pay me enough to think.

1762
01:59:24,286 --> 01:59:29,648
[SPEAKER_07]: Shane, thank you so much for being here tonight, and I'm sorry that Comcast sucks a big fat cock.

1763
01:59:29,688 --> 01:59:33,370
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I meant to give them an FU just to be cool like everybody else, but I forgot.

1764
01:59:33,570 --> 01:59:34,490
[SPEAKER_07]: But thank you for being here.

1765
01:59:34,690 --> 01:59:35,211
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, thank you.

1766
01:59:35,491 --> 01:59:36,731
[SPEAKER_07]: And I hope you had fun anyway.

1767
01:59:36,991 --> 01:59:37,231
[SPEAKER_07]: I did.

1768
01:59:37,512 --> 01:59:37,712
[SPEAKER_07]: Good.

1769
01:59:38,372 --> 01:59:39,472
[SPEAKER_07]: We enjoyed Dance Summit, by the way.

1770
01:59:39,492 --> 01:59:39,833
[SPEAKER_07]: It was fun.

1771
01:59:40,013 --> 01:59:40,613
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, it's cool.

1772
01:59:41,073 --> 01:59:42,754
[SPEAKER_07]: So, we'll see you.

1773
01:59:42,994 --> 01:59:45,816
[SPEAKER_07]: It sounds like we may see you on Wednesday here for the Max 2 show.

1774
01:59:45,856 --> 01:59:47,957
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, instead of being San Fran anymore.

1775
01:59:48,297 --> 01:59:48,938
[SPEAKER_07]: Just cry.

1776
01:59:49,618 --> 01:59:50,078
[SPEAKER_07]: Sadness.

1777
01:59:50,599 --> 01:59:52,400
[SPEAKER_07]: You can come over for Vanilla Sky if you want tomorrow.

1778
01:59:52,600 --> 01:59:53,700
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, I'll have nothing better to do.

1779
01:59:53,720 --> 01:59:54,401
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, we'll see.

1780
01:59:54,421 --> 01:59:55,081
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll get somewhere.

1781
01:59:55,101 --> 01:59:56,762
[SPEAKER_07]: Hopefully, hopefully I can do that show.

1782
01:59:57,342 --> 01:59:57,803
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll see.

1783
01:59:59,223 --> 02:00:01,165
[SPEAKER_07]: Joey, thanks for being here again.

1784
02:00:01,485 --> 02:00:01,985
[SPEAKER_07]: No problem.

1785
02:00:02,565 --> 02:00:03,526
[SPEAKER_07]: And a final thought?

1786
02:00:04,456 --> 02:00:05,416
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, not really.

1787
02:00:05,697 --> 02:00:07,417
[SPEAKER_07]: Congratulations on the three-footer once again, then.

1788
02:00:07,437 --> 02:00:08,097
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1789
02:00:08,937 --> 02:00:13,899
[SPEAKER_07]: That means, you know what, if you keep at this pace, next week will be six-footers, and three weeks you'll have the cattas down.

1790
02:00:13,919 --> 02:00:15,439
[SPEAKER_07]: You'll be just like us, just like that.

1791
02:00:18,240 --> 02:00:20,641
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't think I can work that magic, but I'll sure try.

1792
02:00:21,994 --> 02:00:22,454
[SPEAKER_07]: Puppy.

1793
02:00:22,975 --> 02:00:28,637
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for... Sorry I drive out here all the way from Davis for an under par show, but they're always interesting, aren't they?

1794
02:00:29,818 --> 02:00:30,098
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1795
02:00:30,919 --> 02:00:36,101
[SPEAKER_08]: At least I can actually know what's going on instead of having to sit at my computer and listen to the live station like everyone else.

1796
02:00:38,403 --> 02:00:40,444
[SPEAKER_11]: This damn signal thing annoys me.

1797
02:00:41,944 --> 02:00:43,065
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1798
02:00:43,225 --> 02:00:45,106
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

1799
02:00:45,686 --> 02:00:47,987
[SPEAKER_07]: Aaron, thanks for coming.

1800
02:00:48,168 --> 02:00:48,428
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry...

1801
02:00:49,594 --> 02:00:54,018
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry Erin that your first show had to be kind of a weird one, but you can thank Comcast for that.

1802
02:00:54,499 --> 02:00:54,799
[SPEAKER_03]: It's cool.

1803
02:00:54,959 --> 02:00:56,261
[SPEAKER_07]: But I have a feeling you'll be back.

1804
02:00:57,096 --> 02:00:57,576
[SPEAKER_03]: This puppy.

1805
02:00:57,956 --> 02:00:58,296
[SPEAKER_07]: Good.

1806
02:00:59,017 --> 02:00:59,477
[SPEAKER_03]: Good.

1807
02:00:59,497 --> 02:01:00,157
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm glad to hear it.

1808
02:01:00,337 --> 02:01:02,198
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, I forgot to add one last FU.

1809
02:01:02,558 --> 02:01:03,738
[SPEAKER_03]: I kind of thought of it right now.

1810
02:01:03,798 --> 02:01:04,338
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, what the hell.

1811
02:01:04,379 --> 02:01:04,799
[SPEAKER_03]: Go for it.

1812
02:01:05,139 --> 02:01:08,340
[SPEAKER_03]: It was to, uh, the Scanny went to, was it Sacramento's?

1813
02:01:08,360 --> 02:01:09,320
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1814
02:01:09,360 --> 02:01:13,602
[SPEAKER_03]: Sacramento's for, uh, having a fucked up right side pad.

1815
02:01:14,022 --> 02:01:16,843
[SPEAKER_03]: Because, yeah, on Max 2.

1816
02:01:17,363 --> 02:01:20,484
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know why, but I ended up failing the Whistle Song Maniac.

1817
02:01:21,804 --> 02:01:22,225
[SPEAKER_03]: How?

1818
02:01:22,425 --> 02:01:22,965
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

1819
02:01:26,129 --> 02:01:32,353
[SPEAKER_02]: And Jamie wrote another piece of erotic poetry, Taste Her Nasty Burning Crack Cream.

1820
02:01:36,256 --> 02:01:37,457
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to know, but yeah.

1821
02:01:38,578 --> 02:01:41,940
[SPEAKER_03]: So, fuck Scandia for really fucked up pads.

1822
02:01:43,201 --> 02:01:47,164
[SPEAKER_03]: And stupid teeny bopperish ghetto, quote unquote, ghetto people.

1823
02:01:47,324 --> 02:01:49,105
[SPEAKER_12]: And the retards.

1824
02:01:49,466 --> 02:01:50,386
[SPEAKER_03]: And the retards.

1825
02:01:53,869 --> 02:01:54,209
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah.

1826
02:01:56,243 --> 02:01:57,485
[SPEAKER_03]: Jamie, your final thought.

1827
02:01:59,147 --> 02:02:00,048
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki, your final thought.

1828
02:02:01,951 --> 02:02:03,453
[SPEAKER_07]: My mouth is full of cracker.

1829
02:02:04,555 --> 02:02:06,097
[SPEAKER_13]: No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1830
02:02:08,149 --> 02:02:09,751
[SPEAKER_07]: My final thought is this.

1831
02:02:10,592 --> 02:02:11,573
[SPEAKER_07]: We live in America.

1832
02:02:11,893 --> 02:02:18,080
[SPEAKER_07]: It's about competition, being a capitalist society, making money at the expense of other people.

1833
02:02:18,760 --> 02:02:25,728
[SPEAKER_07]: I beg you, anybody that's out there listening, Sure West, AT&T, well not AT&T because that's technically part of Comcast.

1834
02:02:26,048 --> 02:02:28,371
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure West, anybody out there that's listening,

1835
02:02:29,383 --> 02:02:34,569
[SPEAKER_07]: Build a competitive cable company in this area and bring it out here to where we live.

1836
02:02:34,969 --> 02:02:35,630
[SPEAKER_07]: WinFirst.

1837
02:02:35,990 --> 02:02:37,312
[SPEAKER_07]: God please anyone.

1838
02:02:37,392 --> 02:02:39,614
[SPEAKER_07]: WinFirst got bought by SureWest too.

1839
02:02:40,395 --> 02:02:42,577
[SPEAKER_07]: Do all these companies have to keep fucking buying each other out?

1840
02:02:42,918 --> 02:02:47,483
[SPEAKER_03]: Except if you have WinFirst you can't look at DeviantArt so don't go with them.

1841
02:02:48,404 --> 02:02:51,207
[SPEAKER_07]: And you might not see it on the webcam but I just took off my pants.

1842
02:02:56,369 --> 02:02:56,970
[SPEAKER_03]: They banned it.

1843
02:02:57,550 --> 02:03:05,058
[SPEAKER_03]: They blocked anyone with that ISP for actually going in and saving the pictures off their site.

1844
02:03:06,879 --> 02:03:10,283
[SPEAKER_07]: I beg any other competing cable company out there, please.

1845
02:03:11,069 --> 02:03:15,273
[SPEAKER_07]: Please come out here and give Comcast some competition.

1846
02:03:15,514 --> 02:03:16,955
[SPEAKER_07]: They have a monopoly on the market.

1847
02:03:17,075 --> 02:03:18,797
[SPEAKER_07]: This is the problem that we have.

1848
02:03:19,218 --> 02:03:22,241
[SPEAKER_07]: The reason why this sucks, you guys, I would not put up with this shit.

1849
02:03:22,621 --> 02:03:24,003
[SPEAKER_07]: Going through Live 65 and Comcast.

1850
02:03:24,263 --> 02:03:28,227
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys remember... It's actually very good in the... I'm talking Dish.

1851
02:03:28,568 --> 02:03:29,629
[SPEAKER_07]: You can't get Win First out here.

1852
02:03:32,786 --> 02:03:35,947
[SPEAKER_03]: I've used their service at my friend's house and it's really good service.

1853
02:03:37,007 --> 02:03:43,930
[SPEAKER_07]: Assuming that Loki and I move again in April, which I'm thinking is probably going to be the case, I think we're going to go somewhere where we can get DSL instead of cable.

1854
02:03:43,970 --> 02:03:44,670
[SPEAKER_03]: Move closer!

1855
02:03:46,531 --> 02:03:47,251
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll see, we'll see.

1856
02:03:47,771 --> 02:03:48,591
[SPEAKER_03]: Or buy me gas.

1857
02:03:49,652 --> 02:03:49,992
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll see.

1858
02:03:50,712 --> 02:03:53,033
[SPEAKER_07]: DSL is not supported up here.

1859
02:04:00,137 --> 02:04:02,178
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, I'm done.

1860
02:04:02,218 --> 02:04:02,518
[SPEAKER_07]: That's it.

1861
02:04:02,638 --> 02:04:05,339
[SPEAKER_07]: I just beg somebody compete with Comcast, please.

1862
02:04:05,519 --> 02:04:06,499
[SPEAKER_07]: I need another option.

1863
02:04:06,719 --> 02:04:09,240
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't like this monopoly they have on the market on high-speed internet.

1864
02:04:09,340 --> 02:04:09,620
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki.

1865
02:04:11,641 --> 02:04:11,821
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

1866
02:04:12,581 --> 02:04:13,061
[SPEAKER_03]: Final thought.

1867
02:04:13,381 --> 02:04:14,422
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I have to contribute, actually.

1868
02:04:14,502 --> 02:04:15,462
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, I had a final thought.

1869
02:04:15,862 --> 02:04:16,142
[SPEAKER_12]: Loki.

1870
02:04:17,863 --> 02:04:18,103
[SPEAKER_10]: What?

1871
02:04:18,883 --> 02:04:20,524
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's my contribution to your cabinet.

1872
02:04:23,745 --> 02:04:24,725
[SPEAKER_07]: I got more change.

1873
02:04:24,745 --> 02:04:25,265
[SPEAKER_07]: We could.

1874
02:04:29,031 --> 02:04:32,252
[SPEAKER_03]: I want my coin to be the first one in the coin slot.

1875
02:04:32,272 --> 02:04:33,372
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, I already put one in there.

1876
02:04:37,113 --> 02:04:37,893
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what it is.

1877
02:04:39,134 --> 02:04:40,134
[SPEAKER_07]: For kind donations.

1878
02:04:41,534 --> 02:04:42,214
[SPEAKER_07]: Money for me.

1879
02:04:43,475 --> 02:04:48,256
[SPEAKER_07]: No, my final thought is, why does the sun have to be so hot?

1880
02:04:50,377 --> 02:04:51,017
[SPEAKER_07]: Because it is.

1881
02:04:51,297 --> 02:04:51,617
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

1882
02:04:53,237 --> 02:04:54,959
[SPEAKER_03]: It's because it's a big nuclear tank.

1883
02:04:54,999 --> 02:04:58,644
[SPEAKER_07]: What do you get when you cross a bungee cord with an owl?

1884
02:04:59,705 --> 02:05:00,546
[SPEAKER_07]: My ass.

1885
02:05:02,935 --> 02:05:05,075
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, final word of the show.

1886
02:05:05,856 --> 02:05:09,896
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to give it to Shane because, for God's sakes, he came how far out here.

1887
02:05:09,916 --> 02:05:11,677
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't give my final thought.

1888
02:05:11,717 --> 02:05:12,457
[SPEAKER_07]: You should do it, didn't you?

1889
02:05:12,557 --> 02:05:15,958
[SPEAKER_03]: My final thought is my foot repeatedly kicking your butt.

1890
02:05:16,618 --> 02:05:16,978
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm done.

1891
02:05:17,618 --> 02:05:19,318
[SPEAKER_03]: By the way, in regards to my F.U.

1892
02:05:19,338 --> 02:05:23,439
[SPEAKER_03]: of the week, again, I'm not really pissed off at that site.

1893
02:05:23,819 --> 02:05:24,840
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm pissed off at that person.

1894
02:05:25,880 --> 02:05:30,041
[SPEAKER_03]: And I freaking hate people who abuse their power, so I hope that he catches SARS of the genitals.

1895
02:05:32,438 --> 02:05:35,481
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I just want to say another F you to people that play this game.

1896
02:05:36,082 --> 02:05:37,523
[SPEAKER_07]: I know something you don't know.

1897
02:05:37,923 --> 02:05:39,245
[SPEAKER_07]: I know something you don't know.

1898
02:05:39,345 --> 02:05:40,626
[SPEAKER_07]: I fucking hate that shit.

1899
02:05:41,507 --> 02:05:42,948
[SPEAKER_07]: I know something you don't know.

1900
02:05:43,289 --> 02:05:44,670
[SPEAKER_07]: I know something you don't know.

1901
02:05:45,851 --> 02:05:47,533
[SPEAKER_03]: I probably know lots of things y'all don't know.

1902
02:05:47,933 --> 02:05:53,719
[SPEAKER_07]: But see, it's one thing to know it and keep it a secret that you know it, but it's another thing... You know what?

1903
02:05:53,739 --> 02:05:55,521
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm never telling you what the quadratic formula is.

1904
02:05:55,921 --> 02:05:56,221
[SPEAKER_03]: Never.

1905
02:05:58,507 --> 02:06:05,393
[SPEAKER_07]: It's another thing to be all like openly admitting you know shit and you're just being a dick and not wanting to share it for whatever reason.

1906
02:06:05,413 --> 02:06:06,654
[SPEAKER_07]: I know where the antidote is.

1907
02:06:08,256 --> 02:06:09,417
[SPEAKER_07]: For your mental retardation?

1908
02:06:09,857 --> 02:06:10,017
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

1909
02:06:11,338 --> 02:06:12,640
[SPEAKER_03]: Ooh, he go nasty.

1910
02:06:12,700 --> 02:06:13,420
[SPEAKER_03]: He get nasty.

1911
02:06:13,440 --> 02:06:15,582
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you really know what happened if you take the other pill?

1912
02:06:17,944 --> 02:06:18,725
[SPEAKER_07]: The birth control pill?

1913
02:06:20,306 --> 02:06:20,647
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

1914
02:06:20,667 --> 02:06:21,568
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you know something about that?

1915
02:06:21,768 --> 02:06:21,828
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

1916
02:06:27,479 --> 02:06:37,063
[SPEAKER_03]: I have to say this.

1917
02:06:37,503 --> 02:06:38,803
[SPEAKER_03]: I was on birth control for a little while.

1918
02:06:39,183 --> 02:06:42,785
[SPEAKER_03]: It made me an insane psycho bitch, but I had really good skin.

1919
02:06:43,465 --> 02:06:44,005
There you go.

1920
02:06:48,976 --> 02:06:51,697
[SPEAKER_07]: If you take the red pill, I'll show you how deep this hole goes.

1921
02:06:52,897 --> 02:06:55,258
[SPEAKER_07]: If you take the blue pill, I'll give you an erection.

1922
02:07:00,259 --> 02:07:01,099
[SPEAKER_07]: Right, anyway.

1923
02:07:01,479 --> 02:07:04,820
[SPEAKER_07]: Wait, hold on, no, we can't have final word yet because I don't have the end of the show queued up.

1924
02:07:06,721 --> 02:07:07,481
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm with it today.

1925
02:07:07,521 --> 02:07:10,402
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what, this is just one of those, I'm just writing this show off.

1926
02:07:10,562 --> 02:07:16,463
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys, you know how like big companies when they discover like million dollar debts they have and stuff, they just write it off?

1927
02:07:17,164 --> 02:07:17,804
[SPEAKER_07]: Enron, yeah.

1928
02:07:18,723 --> 02:07:20,884
[SPEAKER_07]: I think you guys were just writing the night off.

1929
02:07:21,024 --> 02:07:24,004
[SPEAKER_03]: This one needs to be like the lost episode.

1930
02:07:24,524 --> 02:07:25,125
[SPEAKER_07]: Seriously.

1931
02:07:27,385 --> 02:07:28,966
[SPEAKER_07]: This is one of the other lost episodes.

1932
02:07:29,446 --> 02:07:31,866
[SPEAKER_07]: Jamie dubs this as a lost episode.

1933
02:07:31,946 --> 02:07:37,708
[SPEAKER_07]: It was lost and caught the void, the big hole, cavernous vagina that is Comcast.

1934
02:07:41,753 --> 02:07:48,822
[SPEAKER_07]: Unfortunately, the end of this show was lost on its way overseas, but it was finished by the Korean recording artists.

1935
02:07:49,703 --> 02:07:50,544

02:07:50,964 --> 02:07:55,550

02:07:55,750 --> 02:07:58,733
[SPEAKER_07]: That's 36 dropouts tonight, you guys, during the show.

1938
02:07:59,034 --> 02:07:59,795
[SPEAKER_07]: We dropped 36 times.

1939
02:08:02,509 --> 02:08:04,732
[SPEAKER_07]: We really need one more for that.

02:08:05,513 --> 02:08:06,254
[SPEAKER_07]: One more drop.

1941
02:08:06,754 --> 02:08:07,435
[SPEAKER_07]: One more drop.

1942
02:08:08,196 --> 02:08:08,597
[SPEAKER_07]: Come on.

1943
02:08:09,578 --> 02:08:10,439
[SPEAKER_07]: Come on, motherfucker.

1944
02:08:10,479 --> 02:08:12,842
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me bog down computer resources.

1945
02:08:12,902 --> 02:08:14,244
[SPEAKER_07]: Come on, get it to drop again.

1946
02:08:14,264 --> 02:08:14,844
[SPEAKER_07]: Come on, we need 37.

1947
02:08:15,425 --> 02:08:16,747
[SPEAKER_06]: We need 37 in a row.

1948
02:08:16,787 --> 02:08:17,828
[SPEAKER_07]: Come on, boy, come on.

1949
02:08:18,769 --> 02:08:19,811
[SPEAKER_07]: Aaron has something she wanted to say.

1950
02:08:22,475 --> 02:08:29,580
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I really wonder if we'll ever find a cock large enough to rape Comcast in the ass for everything they've done to us tonight.

1951
02:08:30,440 --> 02:08:32,582
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know, but I'd be willing to try.

1952
02:08:34,743 --> 02:08:37,725
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry, I don't think you're large enough.

1953
02:08:39,567 --> 02:08:42,689
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it would have to be a collective cock.

1954
02:08:43,770 --> 02:08:45,211
[SPEAKER_09]: One cock together.

1955
02:08:48,926 --> 02:08:54,851
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the cock has to be at least large enough so that in proportion to testicles should be about as large as beanbag chairs.

1956
02:08:55,331 --> 02:08:58,013
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, we could, we could, we could get Pauly Terry and give it a try.

1957
02:08:58,033 --> 02:09:04,958
[SPEAKER_05]: One more?

1958
02:09:04,998 --> 02:09:07,320
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, Rob's over here dragging us.

1959
02:09:07,340 --> 02:09:10,783
[SPEAKER_09]: 37 in a row?

1960
02:09:10,803 --> 02:09:12,884
[SPEAKER_07]: 37 drop.

1961
02:09:13,104 --> 02:09:13,865
[SPEAKER_07]: Quick, end of show.

02:09:13,905 --> 02:09:14,766
[SPEAKER_07]: Shane, final word.
