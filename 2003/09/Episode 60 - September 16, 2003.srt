1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Toto, I have a feeling we're not in Kansas anymore.

2
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,280
You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio, the Lonnie Togg and then some.

3
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:24,480
Uh, mostly the and then some part of that.

4
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:29,160
Orange Lounge Radio is created by a bunch of potty-mouthed adults.

5
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:34,160
Orange Lounge may contain sexual, perverted, and mildly retarded content.

6
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:38,160
You probably shouldn't let your children listen to Orange Lounge radio.

7
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,160
Yes, I will spank your child.

8
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:42,160
If you're not going to do your job, goddammit, I will.

9
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:49,160
Well, here's my big opening.

10
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:51,160
A sphincter says what?

11
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:53,160
I'm super thanks for asking.

12
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:56,160
Oh, you little bitch troll from hell.

13
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,160
What am I doing here?

14
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:00,160
Oh no!

15
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,160
Dodge this.

16
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,160
This is a tasty burger.

17
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:06,160
Look, you stupid bastard, you've got no arms left!

18
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:08,160
It's a house? Look!

19
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:10,160
It's a flesh wound.

20
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:12,160
Searching for a boy in high school is useless.

21
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:16,160
It's searching for meaning in a polished order.

22
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:21,160
Oh yeah? Well, I hope your babies look like monkeys.

23
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:23,160
Dark Sakura.

24
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:24,160
I've had a sniff.

25
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:25,160
Skye.

26
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:27,160
But I'm playing it for the bartender, so suffer.

27
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:29,160
I hate you!

28
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:31,160
Orange Lounge Radio

29
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:37,160
We're live! This is episode 60 for September 14th, 2003.

30
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:44,160
You're tuned into the Bimani scene's most late show of all things Bimani.

31
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:52,160
My name is Loki, and well, Rob's not here because he's a slacker.

32
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:54,160
He is a slacker.

33
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:56,160
We're on time, where is he?

34
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:59,160
We're gonna, you know, let's start with the fuckies of the week.

35
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:01,160
Dear Rob, no.

36
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:07,160
Okay, and in this corner, the happiest bunny on the farm, Dark Sakura.

37
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:09,160
Hi, I have a sandwich.

38
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:11,160
It's tasty.

39
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:14,160
I have cookies, too, and I'm going to maul anyone who touches them.

40
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,160
Cool.

41
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:17,160
And in this corner, we have Rob.

42
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:20,160
Hi, I'm Rob. I'm not here right now.

43
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,160
Please take a message.

44
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:24,160

00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:57,180
Joey Jamie listeners this is Joey hey how's it going

53
00:03:57,180 --> 00:04:04,160
Joey listeners okay so um we should take a break yes we should I think we should

54
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:07,160
We should take that opening break that we usually do right about now.

55
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:15,160
We're going to start off with this break with the first few MP3s I find.

56
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:17,160
So we've got, looks like...

57
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,160
Wait, here, here, here.

58
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,160
Hey! Oh, you got it?

59
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:21,160
Yeah.

60
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:27,160
This is going to be pretty much random stuff, so yeah.

61
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:30,160
Anyways, um, yeah, enjoy.

62
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:34,160
But love's pain, he's got an opportunity to not try again

63
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:38,160
But when she caught his eye, ain't no man to fight for peace

64
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:41,160
He knew he had something left for him

65
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:45,160
But no, he was in the mood for talking

66
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:48,160
So he began to play the game

67
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:52,160
Before he knew it, he had told her how much he'd been learning

68
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:55,160
Though he was hoping she was not the same

69
00:05:55,160 --> 00:06:00,160
Could it be the kind of way that I'm thinking after all of this time?

70
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,160
Could you please fill up?

71
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:06,160
She says, boy, you don't have to look no more

72
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:10,160
I'll give the love you need to your father and the guarantee

73
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:13,160
I'd like to know, boy, I'm a blind lady

74
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:16,160
Counting out for things so good I am the killer

75
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:20,160
And when you wake up late thinking it's a dream

76
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:23,160
So touch me, boy, you know you can count on me

77
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:52,200
Baby, a kind lady that will never leave you lonely

78
00:09:52,200 --> 00:10:21,840
Hello everybody and welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 60 in progress

79
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:33,800
person. I'm a little late. I was a couple minutes late. Sorry guys. My bad. Blame traffic.

80
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:39,120
You know what? The traffic in, nobody can hear you anyway and that's a good thing. The

81
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:44,480
traffic in, where the hell was that? Where 680 meets, Fairfield. Fairfield was horrible

82
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:50,280
because one guy crashes on the side of the road and everybody has to turn their head

83
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:53,400
and see if they can look at a dead body, never fails.

84
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:57,040
Ooh, I think I see an arm! Exactly, exactly.

85
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:01,240
It looks kind of severed. I'm very proud of you guys getting things

86
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:04,800
going anyway, though. I mean, not that Jamie hasn't done it before, certainly, because

87
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:08,200
I remember we took off for L.A. for a couple of times.

88
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:11,680
And although Loki picked... And everyone decided to abandon me to go downstairs

89
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:18,680
and watch the biography of Ron Jeremy. And even though Loki picked the chicken dance

90
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:27,600
first break music. I forgive him anyway. It was cute. It was a nice deviation. Yeah,

91
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:34,400
it was a good deviation from a seven-minute version of Kind Lady. I mean, don't get me

92
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:38,880
wrong, I love Kind Lady, but shit, there's only so much of that song I can take. You

93
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:45,280
just feel the disco groove or something. So, I know we have a lot to talk about in

94
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:49,360
this segment tonight. We could fill up a good hour a show in this right here. So I think

95
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:52,700
we need to play How Was Your Day, How Was Your Week, because, my God, there's a lot

96
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:59,360
to talk about today. I haven't even seen Jamie since, like, last Sunday maybe? Have I seriously

97
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:04,280
not seen you since last Sunday? Yes. That's the first. Isn't that weird? Yeah. That's

98
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:08,680
kind of weird. Usually Jamie and I hang out. My week was very retarded. Well then let's

99
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:15,200
start with you, Jamie. How was your day and how was your week? Very retarded. How so?

100
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:27,140
My week was really dull at work and I was on antibiotics all week which had me not able

101
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:31,980
to eat anything and then my inhaler that made me all shaky and this other stuff that's like

102
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:40,060
sorting sorting snorting like fire tastes like burning it sucked it's like

103
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:46,340
it's like snorting vomit flavored jelly bellies like the Harry Potter ones ew I

104
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:55,100
think we still have some no puppy oh let's try it well there's a dinner for a

105
00:12:55,100 --> 00:13:00,660
month and a half for God's sake we need to get those off of there

106
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:06,260
But anyway, it was basically dull.

107
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:10,820
I came home feeling too tired, too sick to do much of anything.

108
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:17,300
And then to top all that off, my car starts behaving very badly, as in stopping every

109
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:18,300
time I stop.

110
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:19,860
I'm going to be getting into my car later.

111
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:24,940
I kind of remember that because I remember when we were driving places, it was doing

112
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:27,500
that vroom, vroom thing that my old car used to do.

113
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:30,060
But it was really doing it very badly.

114
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:32,640
Finally, it does it at every stop.

115
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:33,640
I decided Friday...

116
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:37,440
I was going to take it in Saturday anyway to have it looked at, but I just did it Friday

117
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:40,200
afternoon because I was so tired of it.

118
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:48,440
I went in on Saturday to go check it out, and apparently the compression's all messed

119
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:49,440
up.

120
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,440
The one side's good.

121
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:51,940
The other side is good.

122
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:59,680
The middle is sunken on my engine, like at an incline, sunken.

123
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:04,380
All right, here's the total cost of what I've spent on my car.

124
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:08,180
I have had little tiny things replaced.

125
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:15,760
I spent nearly $800 having the brakes fixed, catalytic converter put in, a new front axle,

126
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:20,640
and then, not to mention, the oxygen sensor I had replaced much earlier.

127
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:25,900
And now they're saying it's going to cost $1,800 to fix my car.

128
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:28,020
And they likely need a new engine and a back end rebuild.

129
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:29,020
Who'd you take it to?

130
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:34,580
I went to Meinecke. Normally Meinecke is really good. The guy there, he'll at least tell me

131
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:38,840
what's up and offer to let me go take it somewhere else. Now, he worked a couple of hours on

132
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:42,700
my car, which was supposed to be $65 an hour. He only charged me $65 for the diagnostic

133
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:45,980
and that was it. That's cool. And I think he tweaked the engine because I had only stalled

134
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:49,840
once on the way home. You know, you should see, because remember

135
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:53,780
Loki's story, I don't know if this was last week, but you had the brake issue going on

136
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:55,140
Oh, that was this one.

137
00:14:55,140 --> 00:14:56,140
My bad.

138
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:57,140
I don't want to ruin this.

139
00:14:57,140 --> 00:15:00,700
What we're going to do is we're just going to do a patch job on the engine and make it

140
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:01,700
drivable.

141
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:03,780
But in the meantime, Julie's offered to let me use her car.

142
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:05,100
Oh, what a sweetheart.

143
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:07,420
Well, her old car, which went fine.

144
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:11,900
But we tried to take off the dash last night to put in a fan switch because her old fan

145
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:12,900
switch doesn't work.

146
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:13,900
And we just gave up.

147
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:15,660
We're like, we're going to let the men's do it.

148
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:19,700
So Dan and them were supposed to go over it, but I couldn't get ahold of her all day.

149
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:26,700
Okay, normally when I hear, oh, you fucker, I look over and go, what?

150
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:31,700
Yeah, but it wasn't directed at you. No, I don't mean me. I was meaning what goes out.

151
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:35,700
I'm just kidding. Okay, shut up. I'm just going to stare at you.

152
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:42,700
The last piece, piece number 47 of 47 of BeatMania Complete Mix 2 was 68% done. Now it's a 404

153
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:48,780
on the internet might add that each piece is 50 megs in size

154
00:15:50,140 --> 00:16:02,460
dough dough anyway um so my saturday was composed of um lots of uh i went to meanie's cafe because

155
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:07,500
i've never eaten there before they were pretty good uh i bought a car battery go to sam's club

156
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:16,620
up there $47. I bought the fan switch. I bought a multi-tool. I think it's in my pocket still.

157
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:24,020
I have a multi-tool. I feel handy. Hold my multi-tool up. Put it on the camera for me.

158
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:29,080
Go up there. No, stay over there and put it on the camera. Geez, because I'm lazy and

159
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:39,400
or not. That's my multi-tool. It's really neat. It was $3, so that was the cheapest

160
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:46,880
thing I bought all day. Then we went to TGI Fridays last night. After Julie and I were

161
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:53,040
in the middle of the massive game of Phantasy Star, I'm like, give me that. Give me my knife.

162
00:16:53,040 --> 00:17:00,120
I'm still into my Ride and Rock online, however, I am now back in the highly addictive world

163
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:03,000
of PS opium.

164
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:07,280
You chose to take your PSO break right when I started playing, and now that I'm done with

165
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:08,280
it-

166
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:09,280
I'm playing it on Xbox now.

167
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:13,160
I think you're avoiding me is what it is.

168
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:15,520
I'm not avoiding you, Rob.

169
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:18,000
I'm going to go in here.

170
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
No.

171
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:23,200
But that's basically it, and I haven't heard anything about getting the Centro today, so

172
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:28,460
I may have to take the Tercel out again, I'm very upset that the VIC Viper has finally

173
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:36,340
crashed and burned, but I'm thinking of getting, um, sort of looking at an Echo, a 2003 Echo,

174
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:39,580
they're blue, and if I get one it's going to be the Twinbee.

175
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:42,020
I'm a nerd.

176
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:49,020
And I haven't touched any Bimani all week.

177
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:50,020
Good for you.

178
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:51,020
No story.

179
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:55,020
Because you always have to ask, since technically we're supposed to be a Bimani show.

180
00:17:55,020 --> 00:18:00,100
We worked some more on my message board today.

181
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:01,820
I'm going to give myself a shameless plug on this.

182
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:04,020
I was going to say, do you want to give yourself a shameless plug?

183
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:09,820
Roleplay.darksacra.com, sign up there if you want to run a free-form RPG on the message

184
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:11,220
board, sign up.

185
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:15,340
I will set it up for you and make you a moderator of your own forum.

186
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:20,540
And if you want to discuss any role plays, coming soon I'm going to be implementing in

187
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:26,060
the MO RPG forum on there for Phantasy Star Online, Ragnarok, and I may even put a stupid

188
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:27,920
little puzzle of pirates on there.

189
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:28,920
You know what though?

190
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:33,180
Jared's got a great puzzle pirates forum, so it's all right.

191
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:40,260
And I'm going to put one on for actual video games, and yes, we're going to have the Battle

192
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:46,500
Royal RPG discussion forum. We could do a message board style one while we're working

193
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:50,340
on the tabletop one too. I actually signed up for your message board

194
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:54,240
the other day finally. When you called and you wanted me to relay a message, it kind

195
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:58,020
of reminded me, oh I should go sign up for her board.

196
00:18:58,020 --> 00:19:01,860
My boards are really awesome. Sign up for them, everybody master, I'll steal your soul

197
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:06,980
and feed it to my cat so she can poop it in her litter box.

198
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:07,980
What a lovely thought.

199
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:08,980
Thank you.

200
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:09,980
I'm done.

201
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:10,980
Okay.

202
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:11,980
Then let's go on to Bradley.

203
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:12,980
Hello, by the way.

204
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:13,980
How are you?

205
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:14,980
I'm okay.

206
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:15,980
How was your week?

207
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:16,980
How was your day?

208
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:17,980
Pretty uneventful.

209
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:18,980
I'm looking for a job.

210
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:19,980
That's basically everything I did this week.

211
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:33,980
And then I went to Cuzar yesterday, and we'll probably talk about it later with the group.

212
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:34,980
Yes.

213
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:35,980
Cuzar.

214
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:42,980
I don't know if I did anything else interesting at all, only played one game of DDR and that

215
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:54,500
was yesterday. Jamie you did that under my name, now I get

216
00:19:55,980 --> 00:20:02,620
all the credit for that kick. I don't care, you are always nice when you

217
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:09,060
kick people? Or you say something silly? I'm just like, because you suck. Or die or something.

218
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:15,740
So they know it's me anyway. Anyway, okay. I'm sorry to so rudely interrupt

219
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:18,100
you. It's not much to interrupt if I'm not saying

220
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:21,500
much of anything right now. Was there any interesting things you did this

221
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:25,340
week? Any Bamani or accomplishments or anything? No.

222
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:31,700
No? It's all good. Okay, well, moving on then. Puppy?

223
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:32,700
I got a microphone again.

224
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:33,700
Yes.

225
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:34,700
Okay.

226
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:36,360
So what are we talking about again?

227
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:37,360
How was your week?

228
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:38,360
How was your day?

229
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:39,660
Oh, let's see.

230
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:47,380
For my week, I didn't work this week because I was busy spending every single day packing

231
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:51,860
all my stuff into large cardboard boxes so I can throw it in the back of a truck and

232
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:57,140
drive up to Davis and move into my new apartment, which is actually pretty good.

233
00:20:57,140 --> 00:20:59,380
But hooray for not being in the dorms anymore, huh?

234
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:00,380
Yes.

235
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:04,660
moved out of the dorms in my own apartment, it was like, oh my god, life is great.

236
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:12,180
I know. I actually have my car now, too, so I can, you know, leave whenever I need to.

237
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:19,460
And that's good. And then I went to Scandia earlier today and tried to play 2DX, but the

238
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:27,780
damn figure on the right side has to be broken. The damn key keeps, like, freaking out or

239
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:37,460
something and then I played like one game of DDR and got too tired haha old I

240
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:43,260
know I'm getting old damn it must be it must be college dear God what happened

241
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:47,340
to your leg did you get that like camping huh you've got like are those

242
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:51,460
bites all of your leg oh no that's not bites oh I'm sorry I thought they were

243
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:56,500
bites they kind of look like it but they do they're not bites they're just it's

244
00:21:56,500 --> 00:22:02,420
just been having skin issues. Oh, I'm sorry. I thought because you went camping two weeks

245
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:05,940
ago, and when I went camping once, I got bit by so many bugs my legs looked like that.

246
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:11,580
Well, I know better than to go out camping and not have hugs break. Listen! I don't want

247
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:15,860
to go there. I know what to do about camping, because I've been going camping at the same

248
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:19,740
place for like 12 years, so I know the place. Well, don't I feel like an ass? I'm sorry.

249
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:31,860
And now I'm watching Loki type something on the TV computer thing.

250
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:37,120
Any other exciting events you want to share about your week?

251
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,620
Pretty much before yesterday.

252
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:42,360
Oh, oh, I did get to go to Ikea for the first time.

253
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:44,480
Ikea is so studly.

254
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:45,480
I love going to Ikea.

255
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:46,480
It's fucking scary, okay?

256
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:47,480
Why do you think Ikea's scary?

257
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:48,480
IKEA is scary.

258
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:50,400
Big blue furniture Death Star.

259
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:51,400
That's what it is.

260
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:54,720
It's not a big blue furniture Death Star, it is, it is the cool.

261
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:55,720
I love IKEA.

262
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:56,720
Like, it's...

263
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,720
Can I have one of those?

264
00:22:58,720 --> 00:22:59,720
Yes.

265
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:02,960
Okay, IKEA is beautiful, because it's just everything in a box.

266
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:08,560
You can get a chair in a box, a lamp in a box, recliner in a box, couch in a box, tea

267
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:12,560
in a box, whatever you want, you can get it in a box, take it home, put it together.

268
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:14,560
But that's the problem, you have to put the damn shit together.

269
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:15,880
It works like Legos.

270
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:16,880
Can't you read instructions?

271
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:38,520
I bought a desk and a dresser and a TV stand for my apartment and now I spent all of Saturday

272
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:40,080
putting that crap together.

273
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:42,720
There was not one word in the instructions.

274
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:49,720
It was some weird transgender-looking character pointing out things on the pictogram.

275
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:56,720
It's weird, it's like the Swedes are trying to take us over.

276
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:58,720
Those don't know the Swedish on IKEA.

277
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:03,720
I don't think they have IKEA outside of California, I could be wrong.

278
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:05,720
I thought there was IKEA outside of California.

279
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:07,720
Obviously in Sweden.

280
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:08,720
Is there?

281
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:16,020
There's actually one over in Schomburg, Illinois, outside of Chicago, and the only reason why

282
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:20,360
I know this is because I've got a couple of friends that live in Schomburg, and that IKEA

283
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:22,740
blows the one in Emerville out of the water.

284
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:29,240
It is like seven stories tall, and it's huge.

285
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:33,640
That IKEA place is so big.

286
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:35,440
Size is everything at IKEA.

287
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:38,440
I just like to say, seven stories.

288
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:39,600
That's nuts.

289
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:43,240
Wow, I'm having to fan myself to give out that.

290
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:47,000
OK, but they need to learn that particle board is not

291
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:50,920
the best material for furniture.

292
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:54,720
OK, I put my dresser together at the helm of my roommate,

293
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:57,320
and we tried to move it into my closet.

294
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:59,320
And as we're lifting it up, snap,

295
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:01,720
there goes a board on the front of the dresser.

296
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:04,000
I think you put it together right.

297
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,440
She built it like a Riri.

298
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:11,280
OK, Navi, who's on the show quite often, me and him,

299
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:12,480
we went to IKEA one day.

300
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:15,360
Me, him, and Pixie Dust, the Orange Lounge wench,

301
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:18,200
we all went, I'm sorry, she's the madam, not the wench, my bad.

302
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:19,560
We all went to IKEA one day.

303
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:20,520
We had a big trip.

304
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:22,280
We went to the Jelly Belly Factory and went to IKEA.

305
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:24,200
This was like three months ago, right?

306
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:27,040
And we bought a chair that Navi had seen there

307
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:28,760
like three months ago he really wanted.

308
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:30,520
So we bought it, and then we all took it back to his house

309
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:31,480
and put it together.

310
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:32,920
It was so much fun because you had

311
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:09,920
Okay, sex topic just went over my head. Rocking and little bits of salt falling over, or popping.

312
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:16,720
Don't rock this boat. But still, I mean, particle board does not

313
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:20,760
make good furniture, and they need to figure out a better way to put the damn thing together

314
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:26,200
with, I mean, they give you a bunch of little wooden pegs that you have to hammer into holes

315
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:27,840
to hold it together. That's it.

316
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:31,680
It's like Tinker Toys. I know, it is, and that's what's so fucking

317
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:36,400
IKEA is tinker toys for grown-ups.

318
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:40,040
My roommate said they're trying to lower the productivity of Americans so Swedish can take

319
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:41,720
over the country.

320
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:44,880
Why would Swedish people want this country?

321
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:48,880
I don't fucking know!

322
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:52,140
I don't know.

323
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:55,880
Oh, yeah, I got all this stuff put together.

324
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:59,120
It's all about the watches. Watches and clocks.

325
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:04,400
There was no... They're gonna drive us insane by putting clocks everywhere.

326
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:06,720
Okay, that did not look right. Did you ever see a hook?

327
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,780
Just like that.

328
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:12,040
That did not look right from this angle.

329
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:16,080
You're a sicko.

330
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:18,520
Yeah, too bad we're not on TV. Anyway...

331
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:22,240
Oh, we do have the cam. We have the cam, I forgot. And the cam updates even faster now.

332
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,960
Yeah, but it's not pointing in your direction.

333
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:26,320
Oh, I forgot to whore out our chat room. My bad.

334
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:27,320
Do it!

335
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:28,320
Did you guys already do it?

336
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:29,320
Do it!

337
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:30,320
Do it!

338
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:33,860
www.calibomani.com, click on Orange Lounge and click on chat.

339
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:36,560
While you're there, visit our forums, because no one posts in our forums.

340
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:37,860
That makes us sad.

341
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:41,840
And the LiveJournal Community username Orange Lounge.

342
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:45,240
And sooner or later you guys are going to update that site.

343
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:46,680
Right!?

344
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:52,560
We made a purchase last week, I should say, and we're planning to put that purchase to

345
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:53,920
you soon.

346
00:27:53,920 --> 00:28:02,000
kind of purchase would this be? Swedish stock. Yeah, Swedish stock. A Swedish bank account.

347
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:10,760
Okay. We're going to the fjords. Jamie says we're going to the fjords. Okay. Other than

348
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:15,280
that, I went to meet up with a couple of you guys at Qsar last night. We'll talk about

349
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:19,240
Qsar in a minute. Yeah, okay. Because that's a whole topic of its own right there. And

350
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:22,560
I bet.

351
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:24,280
Is there anything you want to say about your week, Joey?

352
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:26,400
I'll probably cover most of it, but...

353
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:28,400
Yeah, you probably will.

354
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:29,400
Is there anything?

355
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:31,400
Well, I'll go back.

356
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:33,060
Okay, go back.

357
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:35,260
I'll go back.

358
00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:42,620
Last week, I went to Bodega Bay, and there was about seven of us friends, and we took

359
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:46,700
a trip, it's a yearly trip that we always go to Bodega Bay, ran out of house out there,

360
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:47,840
and uh...

361
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:49,340
stave

362
00:28:49,340 --> 00:28:50,600
four days three nights

363
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:51,540
really fun

364
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:53,320
houses right on the ocean

365
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:55,560
and uh... so we just take it there for

366
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:57,960
you know the four days

367
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:59,020
and uh...

368
00:28:59,020 --> 00:29:02,420
drink up and

369
00:29:02,420 --> 00:29:05,880
so that's what it's almost like that movie we saw

370
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:07,480
where they went to the cabin

371
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:09,380
partied party yes

372
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:13,520
you guys are a party animal we went and saw cabin fever yes we went and saw cabin fever

373
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:14,860
two days ago

374
00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:16,860
Most disturbing film I think I've ever seen.

375
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:17,860
Very disturbing.

376
00:29:17,860 --> 00:29:18,860
I will agree.

377
00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:19,860
I don't get disturbed by movies.

378
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:20,860
I know.

379
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:22,860
I'm not going to talk too much about it, but...

380
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:23,860
What?

381
00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:24,860
What's this?

382
00:29:24,860 --> 00:29:25,860
Eh.

383
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:26,860
Second most disturbing film.

384
00:29:26,860 --> 00:29:27,860
Okay, I'm sorry.

385
00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:28,860
Second most disturbing film I've seen.

386
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:29,860
We'll be the first.

387
00:29:29,860 --> 00:29:33,220
That Ichi the Killer that Loki was talking about last week.

388
00:29:33,220 --> 00:29:34,780
I'm sorry.

389
00:29:34,780 --> 00:29:35,780
That's too much.

390
00:29:35,780 --> 00:29:39,580
I mean, if there's a line, that movie crossed it.

391
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:40,580
I don't know.

392
00:29:40,580 --> 00:29:43,620
We saw 28 Days Later yesterday, and that was pretty disturbing, too.

393
00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:44,620
I like 28 Days Later, though.

394
00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:45,620
I'd already seen it.

395
00:29:45,620 --> 00:29:47,620
By the way, we brought you a movie.

396
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:48,620
Thanks.

397
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:50,060
No, no, no, no, no, no.

398
00:29:50,060 --> 00:29:57,880
The most disturbing movie ever is freaking Manos, The Hands of Fate.

399
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:58,880
You know what?

400
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,460
Even Suicide Circle, that's just bad.

401
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:01,460
That's just bad.

402
00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:02,460
Not disturbing.

403
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:08,020
Suicide Circle, a little strange, but not disturbing.

404
00:30:08,020 --> 00:30:12,460
It's creepy and thought provoking, but not really disturbing unless you happen to have

405
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:16,660
fixations about, you know, flesh!

406
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:19,780
Well, there's Captain Fear for you. A lot of flesh tearing.

407
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:23,260
Yeah, it was nasty. It was pretty brutal. Tim Curry in legend.

408
00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:27,580
Disturbing. Yeah, I'll agree with that. But so great.

409
00:30:27,580 --> 00:30:31,500
Anyway, sorry to interrupt. Anyway,

410
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:35,740
what else? So that was that. That was a cool trip. Came back, didn't want to go back

411
00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:37,740
home, and

412
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:39,100
that's why I took a day

413
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:43,460
a vacation before my vacation, and a day vacation after my vacation, because I was told it was

414
00:30:43,460 --> 00:30:44,460
time to go home.

415
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:45,460
That's right.

416
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:46,460
Nobody ever wants to go back to work after vacation.

417
00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:47,460
That's right.

418
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:51,020
So I took Monday off, and then I took two hours before Tuesday to go in, so I had a

419
00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:52,020
six-hour day on Tuesday.

420
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:53,800
So anyway, it was good.

421
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:55,040
Worked all week.

422
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:56,040
That was hellish.

423
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:59,380
Does anybody here like their job?

424
00:30:59,380 --> 00:31:00,380
Show of hands.

425
00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:01,380
Like their job.

426
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:02,380
Well, I love my job.

427
00:31:02,380 --> 00:31:03,380
You don't work.

428
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:04,380
Yes, you.

429
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:05,380
I know you work.

430
00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:12,820
What the hell are you talking about, I don't work?

431
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:13,820
But you're back in school!

432
00:31:13,820 --> 00:31:16,060
Well, I'm going to be working.

433
00:31:16,060 --> 00:31:17,060
Where?

434
00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:18,060
I don't know yet.

435
00:31:18,060 --> 00:31:20,860
I still have to go out this weekend.

436
00:31:20,860 --> 00:31:21,860
Like right now?

437
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:22,860
Right this second?

438
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:23,860
You're not working?

439
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:24,860
No.

440
00:31:24,860 --> 00:31:29,420
But I am still on the payroll at Golfland.

441
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:31,260
Alright, my bad.

442
00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:33,660
And then later on I'll deal with the whole thing.

443
00:31:33,660 --> 00:31:40,420
And how you enjoy your job working at a golf land, I'll never know, especially after what

444
00:31:40,420 --> 00:31:42,420
happened to you this summer, which I want to talk about later.

445
00:31:42,420 --> 00:31:46,300
Yes, I will talk about it later, but it's not Roseville and there's not hundreds of

446
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:49,620
thousands of snotty shithead kids to deal with.

447
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:52,620
And no water slides.

448
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:55,140
To the love of God, do not bring up each of the killer mid-show.

449
00:31:55,140 --> 00:31:59,700
Oh no, please don't.

450
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:00,700
All I need to...

451
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:01,700
Yeah.

452
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:03,140
So I'll have to say yes, I do love my job.

453
00:32:03,140 --> 00:32:08,380
I mean, I've been there for over nine years now, and I don't see myself going anywhere

454
00:32:08,380 --> 00:32:09,380
any time soon.

455
00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:11,340
To be honest, I actually like my job a lot.

456
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:15,900
Like four months ago, before I was promoted, I'd be complaining about it a lot, but right

457
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:16,900
now, love it.

458
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:19,100
I really do.

459
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:21,940
Looking forward to a fat pay increase.

460
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:23,780
Mine's busy now that peak season's almost over.

461
00:32:23,780 --> 00:32:31,020
All you college students just need to hurry up and get in school and stop calling.

462
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:35,360
I can't really say that because I've talked to so many neat and cool people.

463
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:40,480
Your typical college student is smarter than your typical mortgage person.

464
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:41,480
Typical homeowner.

465
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:42,480
Really?

466
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:43,480
Let's go there.

467
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:44,480
Typical.

468
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:48,480
I, for one, am a homeowner.

469
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:53,800
I used to work in mortgage customer service and you have no idea how many people I had

470
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:56,520
to explain how to read their loan documents.

471
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:57,520
It's not funny.

472
00:32:57,520 --> 00:32:58,680
Well, it's, yeah.

473
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:00,160
I would say they are kind of complicated.

474
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:10,760
I see people who sign with an X. That's pretty bad. Signing with an X, that's

475
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:13,820
pretty bad. You know what's even better on your driver's

476
00:33:13,820 --> 00:33:18,040
license? I had friends that had this too. They signed it and then they put a happy face

477
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:22,700
next to it. It's those people that are so pretty that they always sign everything with

478
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:28,500
a happy face. That's just being sixteen. If I ever worked retail, I would say, I'm sorry,

479
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:34,140
this doesn't match your driver's license you need to put a happy face they need to take

480
00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:40,240
all the happy people and put them on an island 42 people at a time put these nice pretty

481
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:44,780
shiny colors on them and give them all a weapon and have them kill each other off in three

482
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:50,100
days electro shock oh no battle royale have you seen battle royale no i haven't no i have

483
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:57,780
not seen battle royale yet that's it next time are you going to de-virginize me i'm

484
00:33:57,780 --> 00:34:18,260
I'm going to bring over the DVD and have you watch it sometime.

485
00:34:18,260 --> 00:34:26,180
Japanese movie put out what, 99? 94, put out 94. Oh, I don't think it's that old, dear.

486
00:34:26,180 --> 00:34:31,540
Is it? Well, whenever it was put out. It's 2000, okay. Well, regardless, it's not that

487
00:34:31,540 --> 00:34:36,540
old is the point. So, it's not that old and they put a bunch of students on an island

488
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:40,260
and when we say students, we're talking like seventh and eighth grade kids, ninth grade

489
00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:44,060
kids and it's some kind of government program where they basically say, you guys have to

490
00:34:44,060 --> 00:34:48,540
kill each other, and the last one standing gets to go home. And it's really violent,

491
00:34:48,540 --> 00:34:52,460
because, you know, it's not American movies, so they're not subject to all the, you know,

492
00:34:52,460 --> 00:34:58,340
R rating stuff. What? It had a theatrical release in Europe. See, but the British don't

493
00:34:58,340 --> 00:35:02,220
care. You can show tit on TV in Britain, and no one cares. But, basically, it's really

494
00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:07,100
violent, and kids kill each other, and it's great, because kids get really annoying, especially

495
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:31,620
I

496
00:35:31,620 --> 00:35:33,460
like picturing them as junior high school kids.

497
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:36,460
Don't ruin my fantasy!

498
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:38,460
You're sick!

499
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:41,460
You're a sick man.

500
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:43,460
Playing DDR as long as I have.

501
00:35:43,460 --> 00:35:49,460
You get to hate kids real fast.

502
00:35:49,460 --> 00:35:50,460
Anyway, hi.

503
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:51,460
I love those things.

504
00:35:51,460 --> 00:35:52,460
Anything else?

505
00:35:52,460 --> 00:35:54,460
Oh, don't encourage them.

506
00:35:54,460 --> 00:35:57,460
Don't encourage them.

507
00:35:57,460 --> 00:35:58,460
You know what?

508
00:35:58,460 --> 00:36:00,460
I still love this thing.

509
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:01,460
Yeah, baby.

510
00:36:01,460 --> 00:36:07,460
I think I would start bringing him all of a sudden.

511
00:36:07,460 --> 00:36:09,460
Don't you have to take a nap?

512
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:10,460
Actually, I am quite tired.

513
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:11,460
I've been driving all goddamn day.

514
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:12,460
Rob, you're on a time-out.

515
00:36:12,460 --> 00:36:13,460
Go in the room.

516
00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:14,460
Uh-oh.

517
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:15,460
I have the microphone!

518
00:36:15,460 --> 00:36:16,460
You are cool.

519
00:36:16,460 --> 00:36:17,460
You like the ferrets.

520
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:18,460
He just sneezed.

521
00:36:18,460 --> 00:36:19,460
I can't believe he just sneezed.

522
00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:29,460
Rob is making the give me hand, trying to take the microphone away from me.

523
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:32,100
Oh, and look at the eye on the floor!

524
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:33,100
Jimmy's here!

525
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:34,100
She's pouting!

526
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:35,100
Look at that lip!

527
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:36,100
My goodness.

528
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:37,100
Rob's being cute, okay?

529
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:38,100
I have to give it back.

530
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:39,100
I win.

531
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:40,100
What is this, Ferret?

532
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:45,100
We got present with that Ferret, and that was funny.

533
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:47,820
That was a flying Ferret, though.

534
00:36:47,820 --> 00:36:52,340
Those are... are... special.

535
00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:53,340
Special!

536
00:36:53,340 --> 00:36:54,340
No, this is special.

537
00:36:54,340 --> 00:36:57,820
One of these was, like, long gone, and we couldn't find it, anyway.

538
00:36:57,820 --> 00:36:58,820
It's right here.

539
00:37:58,820 --> 00:38:01,580
a couple of years, so Joey was like, let's go today.

540
00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:02,580
I'm like, OK.

541
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:03,780
So we went to the beach today.

542
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:05,500
We went over to Stinson Beach.

543
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:07,460
Stinson Beach over on Highway 1.

544
00:38:07,460 --> 00:38:10,420
Which is right just north of San Francisco.

545
00:38:10,420 --> 00:38:13,740
And you have to take the most windiest road to get there.

546
00:38:13,740 --> 00:38:15,700
It's so fun to drive.

547
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:18,900
Luckily, I didn't have to drive.

548
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:20,860
Oh, I was having fun.

549
00:38:20,860 --> 00:38:22,820
He was holding onto the goddamn door.

550
00:38:22,820 --> 00:38:25,780
I was not holding onto the goddamn door.

551
00:38:25,780 --> 00:38:28,740
Did you master the inertia drift while driving?

552
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:34,380
The INERTIA Drift.

553
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:40,360
Oh, I love racing games.

554
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:41,360
I love racing games.

555
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:43,540
I will bring Initial D over next Sunday then.

556
00:38:43,540 --> 00:38:44,540
Cool.

557
00:38:44,540 --> 00:38:45,540
I said it last week and I will say it this week.

558
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:49,240
F, Initial D, F0 is where it is at.

559
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:53,120
F0 is much better.

560
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:55,920
I know I would.

561
00:38:55,920 --> 00:39:02,200
Okay, so, the windy roads, we went to the beach, and the beach was fun, we took about

562
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:04,600
a gazillion pictures, and there's, uh...

563
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:06,080
Yeah, we did take a lot of pictures, but...

564
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:10,920
Thank you for taking all sorts of, like, disgusting pictures of me trying to climb the rock, like,

565
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:11,920
bending over, trying to...

566
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:14,360
Oh, they were, you guys all love this!

567
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:18,080
I got some blackmail pictures!

568
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:21,800
I'm trying to climb these rocks, because I wanted a picture of me on top of the rock,

569
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:23,280
so I could take a picture and say, I rock.

570
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:25,760
Oh, and I just kept on snapping, as he was climbing, it was great!

571
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:29,480
And so he's making a movie out of it, he just keeps on snapping, filling up my camera.

572
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:33,360
I get it back, I'm like, who took 48 pictures?

573
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:34,360
I did.

574
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:39,880
Anyway, so we had fun at the beach, and I still have sand all over my feet though, and

575
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:43,040
the tides suck, I got sand on my pants and everything.

576
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:45,180
The water was 60 degrees, it was quite lovely.

577
00:39:45,180 --> 00:39:49,480
But this is why we're late, then, you know, we kind of, we knew how long it would take

578
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:52,700
us to get home from the freeway, I think, but we didn't account for the slow-ass grandma

579
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:58,940
drivers on the curvy roads who actually take it at the speed limit and you can't pass them.

580
00:39:58,940 --> 00:40:06,300
Like five miles the whole trip and I'm like, there's passing lanes, turnouts, use them.

581
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:09,500
So we got stuck behind them. Grandmas or grandpas listening out there,

582
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:13,580
you know, turnouts, use them. And not only did that slow us up, but then

583
00:40:13,580 --> 00:40:19,340
when we got to Vacaville or whatever that was, not Vacaville, Fairfield, there was all

584
00:40:19,340 --> 00:40:26,860
the traffic, and if it had not been for that accident, we would have been here on time.

585
00:40:26,860 --> 00:40:31,100
So for all those of you that get in car accidents, stop it and learn how to drive.

586
00:40:31,100 --> 00:40:40,060
You know what's actually interesting is that a lot of the time it's not rubberneck drivers

587
00:40:40,060 --> 00:40:42,580
that cause the traffic to slow down. Really?

588
00:40:42,580 --> 00:40:49,580
Often the Highway Patrol actually sends out units to create traffic breaks.

589
00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:54,580
It happened a couple days ago when I was on my way back from IKEA.

590
00:40:54,580 --> 00:40:56,580
They probably do that on major accidents, right?

591
00:40:56,580 --> 00:41:11,580
Actually, no. As I was going down 580 heading home from IKEA, there was a minor two car accident on the right-hand shoulder right near a freeway entrance.

592
00:41:11,580 --> 00:41:16,860
and then two highway patrolmen busted ahead of traffic and created a traffic break and

593
00:41:16,860 --> 00:41:22,540
actually stopped, slowed down everyone to about 15 miles an hour as they passed the

594
00:41:22,540 --> 00:41:25,720
accident site, then pulled off the road and let everyone go.

595
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:29,180
Which makes sense, so the cleanup crew and everything can take care of it.

596
00:41:29,180 --> 00:41:33,300
I've seen that happen twice in Sacramento actually, same intersection, same time of

597
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:39,540
day. Like we were coming back from the club, on the highway, coming back from downtown,

598
00:41:39,540 --> 00:41:43,620
same intersection, Fulton and Eighty, I've seen two huge wrecks there, and the policemen,

599
00:41:43,620 --> 00:41:47,940
they drive across all the lanes of traffic, and they do it really slow to pace the rest

600
00:41:47,940 --> 00:41:51,580
of the traffic, because you can't get by them, because you don't want to pass a cop anyway.

601
00:41:51,580 --> 00:41:55,980
But he's driving across all the lanes of traffic. That would be a great racing game.

602
00:41:55,980 --> 00:41:58,820
Pace car driver! Pace car driver!

603
00:41:58,820 --> 00:42:05,820
Oh my god, that would be beautiful. Then you could do it to your own beat.

604
00:42:05,820 --> 00:42:12,980
That's funny, VidPower is like speed limit, what's that?

605
00:42:12,980 --> 00:42:18,860
Something that is posted on the highway that you're supposed to follow, but you notice

606
00:42:18,860 --> 00:42:26,300
that on the highways it'll say maximum speed of 65 miles an hour.

607
00:42:26,300 --> 00:42:30,460
But in the city it has just speed limit, 35, speed limit, 40.

608
00:42:30,460 --> 00:42:31,460
So it's not the max.

609
00:42:31,460 --> 00:42:36,380
You can go 65 out of 40, but it's just not the maximum speed limit, you know?

610
00:42:36,380 --> 00:42:39,140
Have you ever told that to a cop?

611
00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:40,400
Actually no.

612
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:42,220
What about where they have maximum and minimums?

613
00:42:42,220 --> 00:42:45,540
I'd love for them to go after the people who are not going the minimum.

614
00:42:45,540 --> 00:42:47,300
That would be beautiful.

615
00:42:47,300 --> 00:42:51,060
They pull over people going 50 into 65, I mean, come on.

616
00:42:51,060 --> 00:42:53,760
Joey and I were talking about this on the drive home today too.

617
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:58,340
We decided that there needs to be a lane just for special people like us.

618
00:42:58,340 --> 00:42:59,580
Screw the special people.

619
00:42:59,580 --> 00:43:00,740
Well, it should be Joey's lane.

620
00:43:00,740 --> 00:43:01,740
Hello?

621
00:43:01,740 --> 00:43:04,820
You know, I don't have to deal with these idiot morons that don't know how to drive.

622
00:43:04,820 --> 00:43:05,820
You know what?

623
00:43:05,820 --> 00:43:09,500
Or how about a lane that you have to pass an IQ test to be able to drive in?

624
00:43:09,500 --> 00:43:11,560
Like, here's the test.

625
00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:12,560
You know what?

626
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:14,220
The higher the IQ, the stupider they get.

627
00:43:14,220 --> 00:43:15,220
I don't get it.

628
00:43:15,220 --> 00:43:21,100
When you see an accident on the side of the road, do you A, stop to help, B, slow down

629
00:43:21,100 --> 00:43:26,300
to look at dead bodies, C, drive faster?

630
00:43:26,300 --> 00:43:31,300
If you ask for a C, you get to drive in the special lane.

631
00:43:31,300 --> 00:43:36,300
Of course, you could just have flying cars because you don't have to deal with highways.

632
00:43:36,300 --> 00:43:38,300
That would be so much simpler.

633
00:43:38,300 --> 00:43:41,300
Thank you, George Jetson.

634
00:43:41,300 --> 00:43:48,300
Being in the position that I am in, if I see something like that, I would have to actually call CHP to make sure somebody's on the way.

635
00:43:48,300 --> 00:43:50,300
Aww, you're a good Samaritan.

636
00:43:50,300 --> 00:43:51,300
I wouldn't stop and help.

637
00:43:51,300 --> 00:43:52,300
Do it from your cell phone while you're driving.

638
00:43:52,300 --> 00:43:53,300
I would have to call CHP.

639
00:43:53,300 --> 00:43:54,300
That's just me.

640
00:43:54,300 --> 00:44:06,140
I think that's all I want to say, because we'll talk about QSAR later.

641
00:44:06,140 --> 00:44:08,140
I'm sure Loki might get into it or whatever.

642
00:44:08,140 --> 00:44:10,940
We need to take a break before we talk about that, but Loki, do you want to talk about

643
00:44:10,940 --> 00:44:13,220
your week, your day?

644
00:44:13,220 --> 00:44:18,540
Sure, why not, you know, since I'm just sitting here.

645
00:44:18,540 --> 00:44:22,420
This week wasn't all that important, you know, it wasn't like I had my birthday or anything,

646
00:44:22,420 --> 00:44:26,300
and uh, yeah, I'm twenty-three.

647
00:44:26,300 --> 00:44:27,820
No one died except for John Reeder.

648
00:44:27,820 --> 00:44:28,820
I cleaned.

649
00:44:28,820 --> 00:44:29,820
Oh my goodness.

650
00:44:29,820 --> 00:44:32,820
Yeah, but I didn't kill Johnny Cash.

651
00:44:32,820 --> 00:44:35,820
John Reeder, though, was me.

652
00:44:35,820 --> 00:44:36,820
There you go.

653
00:44:36,820 --> 00:44:37,820
Oh man.

654
00:44:37,820 --> 00:44:38,820
Johnny Cash.

655
00:44:38,820 --> 00:44:41,820
He had one foot in the grave anyway, I mean, when his wife died.

656
00:44:41,820 --> 00:44:47,100
Hey, hey, I, you know, I was really depressed, and I normally don't get depressed for famous

657
00:44:47,100 --> 00:44:48,100
people.

658
00:44:48,100 --> 00:44:53,180
Don't get me wrong, Johnny Cash, great man, talented man, but his wife died four months

659
00:44:53,180 --> 00:44:54,180
ago.

660
00:44:54,180 --> 00:44:55,620
He's been having all sorts of problems anyway.

661
00:44:55,620 --> 00:44:56,620
It was time.

662
00:44:56,620 --> 00:44:59,900
Bless him for trying to keep going on, but the same thing happened with my grandma and

663
00:44:59,900 --> 00:45:00,900
my grandpa.

664
00:45:00,900 --> 00:45:01,900
It's just too hard.

665
00:45:01,900 --> 00:45:02,900
His spouse goes, you're next.

666
00:45:02,900 --> 00:45:04,220
You get sick often.

667
00:45:04,220 --> 00:45:07,540
This is what happened with my aunt.

668
00:45:07,540 --> 00:45:15,900
When her father died, her mother passed within six hours of him, and she was in perfect health.

669
00:45:15,900 --> 00:45:20,120
I guess that, you know, I'm glad that they're all, you know, united again, but it was very

670
00:45:20,120 --> 00:45:21,120
depressing.

671
00:45:21,120 --> 00:45:22,120
Anyway, I'm sorry, happy birthday.

672
00:45:22,120 --> 00:45:26,400
So, what you're saying is Johnny Cash was so distraught over the fact that John Ritter

673
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:29,840
died that he, too, showed up?

674
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:31,480
I don't know about that.

675
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:32,840
I don't know.

676
00:45:32,840 --> 00:45:36,000
Anyways, so yeah, I didn't do too much this week.

677
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:42,800
I took two days off, so I had a four-day weekend, and Thursday I went and got my breaks done,

678
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:48,640
I took it over to the mechanic that happens to be just a few feet from our door, literally

679
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:49,640
right over the fence.

680
00:45:49,640 --> 00:45:50,640
How convenient!

681
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:56,200
So I took it over there, and I found out that I got my brakes done, it didn't need to really

682
00:45:56,200 --> 00:45:59,480
be done, but I went ahead and did the back brace because it was kind of a birthday gift

683
00:45:59,480 --> 00:46:01,880
for my mom.

684
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:07,360
So I found out that Speedy Oil Change lied about my brakes needing to be done, they just

685
00:46:07,360 --> 00:46:08,360
wanted more service from me.

686
00:46:08,360 --> 00:46:09,360
You know what?

687
00:46:09,360 --> 00:46:16,000
have that just speedy in general or any kind of those quickie loops don't go

688
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:22,280
that's all I have to say well and they broke my axle they see hello to my axle

689
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:27,360
so that I'd have to come back and have it replaced there too you know I can't

690
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:31,000
prove that they did break it but I think they broke it a little bit more because

691
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:37,640
right after I got my tune up there my car started you know grinding when I

692
00:46:37,640 --> 00:46:42,880
I turned right, which is from my right front axle going out.

693
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:45,560
But that's not going to cost that much to replace,

694
00:46:45,560 --> 00:46:47,400
so that's cool.

695
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:49,760
And they're working my pad some more.

696
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:51,320
I have them all framed now.

697
00:46:51,320 --> 00:46:52,440
They're all pretty.

698
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:56,480
And yes, they're sitting on the patio.

699
00:46:56,480 --> 00:47:02,320
And yesterday, or right now, Friday, I

700
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:05,640
went and bought a TV, a 27-inch TV

701
00:47:05,640 --> 00:47:07,400
that I'll be using in my cabinet.

702
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:10,240
And let me just say that was the most entertaining thing

703
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:12,520
to watch for anyone else that was out there

704
00:47:12,520 --> 00:47:16,040
in that parking lot, me trying to get that in my car.

705
00:47:16,040 --> 00:47:18,200
It wouldn't fit in the back door.

706
00:47:18,200 --> 00:47:20,000
It wouldn't fit in the trunk.

707
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,300
So I ended up having to break the box open,

708
00:47:22,300 --> 00:47:26,000
cram the TV into the front seat, and pad it

709
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,120
with the phone that was inside there,

710
00:47:28,120 --> 00:47:31,280
strap the seat belt around it, and hope to God

711
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:35,560
that when I turn corners that it doesn't crush me when it rolls.

712
00:47:35,560 --> 00:47:36,680
So that was fun.

713
00:47:36,680 --> 00:47:40,680
And then getting it in the door as the neighbors are standing there watching me going,

714
00:47:40,680 --> 00:47:43,680
Ugh, it's so heavy!

715
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:45,680
And then, um, so I did that.

716
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:48,680
Right, that's a quick hint.

717
00:47:48,680 --> 00:47:51,680
What else?

718
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:54,680
Oh, yeah, then yesterday we went and played Cheez-Art,

719
00:47:54,680 --> 00:47:59,680
and I kicked ass and won every game, as usual.

720
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:04,680
And there's some guy there that called me fat, and I laughed at him.

721
00:48:04,680 --> 00:48:06,080
That was so great.

722
00:48:06,080 --> 00:48:08,000
Bokey's like, that guy called me fat.

723
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:11,480
And it was the guy that worked there.

724
00:48:11,480 --> 00:48:13,760
He was just pissed off that I was beaten up on him.

725
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:16,080
But we ended up tying, and we shook hands at the end.

726
00:48:16,080 --> 00:48:18,600
That's all it's about, you know, just talking.

727
00:48:18,600 --> 00:48:19,480
What is this shit?

728
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:20,520
That's not what I do.

729
00:48:20,520 --> 00:48:21,600
What are you talking about?

730
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:22,720
Q's are that's what you do.

731
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:23,220
You talk.

732
00:48:23,220 --> 00:48:24,000
That's gay.

733
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:24,720
You talk shit.

734
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:26,000
You talk shit all the time.

735
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,720
And at the very end, you know, you just

736
00:48:27,720 --> 00:48:29,720
thank them for a good game, because that's what it is.

737
00:48:29,720 --> 00:48:32,160
Because the next game, they could be whooping up on you.

738
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:34,600
And the game after that, you could be whooping on them.

739
00:48:34,600 --> 00:48:40,520
never know. It's just a different situation each time, so. What? I just don't talk to

740
00:48:40,520 --> 00:48:43,880
anybody and then I sneak up on them and poke my gun in their back and then fire and run

741
00:48:43,880 --> 00:48:49,320
away giggling. Well, then we started doing G stuff because the arena isn't built that

742
00:48:49,320 --> 00:48:54,880
well so the red headquarters, they didn't paint it too well and so we were tagging the

743
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:58,160
headquarters from outside the headquarters because the plexiglass wasn't covered all

744
00:48:58,160 --> 00:49:04,160
the way. Lame. Let me just say, being on the team that was defeated by you, lame. Oh, shit.

745
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:05,160
Oh, great.

746
00:49:05,160 --> 00:49:06,160
Sheet.

747
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:07,160
Sheet.

748
00:49:07,160 --> 00:49:08,960
We were bouncing shots off the windows and stuff like that.

749
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:13,080
I was actually on the other side of the arena, seeing the lights on the windows.

750
00:49:13,080 --> 00:49:14,080
Great stuff.

751
00:49:14,080 --> 00:49:15,080
So we did that.

752
00:49:15,080 --> 00:49:16,080
We had fun.

753
00:49:16,080 --> 00:49:21,920
Played some Cuzar, dropped some business cards off there, so hopefully someone picked them

754
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:26,480
up that was listening to the show tonight, even though I don't think so.

755
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:27,480
And that's it.

756
00:49:27,480 --> 00:49:28,840
There was no hicks there.

757
00:49:28,840 --> 00:49:29,840
I was surprised.

758
00:49:29,840 --> 00:49:30,840
No hicks at all.

759
00:49:30,840 --> 00:49:34,840
They knew we were coming and fled.

760
00:49:34,840 --> 00:49:39,440
But there was some guy that just gave Ryan, not puppy Ryan, but zero Ryan a hug out of

761
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:40,440
nowhere.

762
00:49:40,440 --> 00:49:42,440
Some guy was hugging him goodbye.

763
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:43,440
That's right.

764
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:44,440
Really?

765
00:49:44,440 --> 00:49:45,440
The way it started...

766
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:46,840
He said it wasn't the same guy.

767
00:49:46,840 --> 00:49:48,400
No, it wasn't the same guy.

768
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:51,920
But the way it started, he came up and said goodbye to everybody.

769
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:55,520
And then he wanted to ask some kind of questions.

770
00:49:55,520 --> 00:50:02,520
I think he was like, I don't know, religious or something, wanting to talk about God.

771
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:20,520
Uh-oh. Uh-oh. I missed all that. Anyways. Moving on. Oops. Yeah. Oh well. Anyway, so then

772
00:50:20,520 --> 00:50:28,560
So then later on we left and then I came back here and I was exhausted and today I bought

773
00:50:28,560 --> 00:50:33,280
everything to convert all of our game systems over to S-Video and I bought a bunch of...

774
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:42,200
I raped Radio Shack's little component cabinet and I took all their crimp connections for

775
00:50:42,200 --> 00:50:46,080
nine pin serial things for my cabinet and all that stuff and I got some pretty nifty

776
00:50:46,080 --> 00:50:51,360
stuff from the cabinet. But next week I'm going to be buying all the wood for the main

777
00:50:51,360 --> 00:50:59,200
cabinet and we'll hopefully have it built in under a month. So, yay.

778
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:03,120
Okay, that was this week's edition of How Was Your Day, How Was Your Week. I want to

779
00:51:03,120 --> 00:51:05,840
talk a little more about Q's are when we come back and buy...

780
00:51:05,840 --> 00:51:06,840
Well, not now.

781
00:51:06,840 --> 00:51:09,960
Because it's time for a break. We've been talking for like 40 minutes straight here,

782
00:51:09,960 --> 00:51:10,960
so we're going to take a break.

783
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:11,960
Okay, fine.

784
00:51:11,960 --> 00:51:17,600
I said so and I want to stretch so we will be you right back. You're listening Orange

785
00:51:17,600 --> 00:51:24,600
launch radio thank you

786
00:52:17,600 --> 00:52:33,600
Every night I look at the sky All you're leaving was blue

787
00:52:33,600 --> 00:52:40,600
Every night, every night

788
00:52:40,600 --> 00:52:48,600
Baby, if you want me to come back

789
00:52:57,600 --> 00:53:01,600
Every time I lose my self-control

790
00:53:01,600 --> 00:53:05,000
It feels like I can't let you go

791
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:08,600
I'm at the point of no return

792
00:53:12,100 --> 00:53:15,600
Don't ever wanna come back down

793
00:53:15,600 --> 00:53:19,100
I'm not slow high above the ground

794
00:53:19,100 --> 00:53:22,600
You're stealing, I will always yell

795
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:26,600
Kicking away

796
00:53:27,100 --> 00:53:28,400
I'm flying

797
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:31,800
I'm gonna head for paradise

798
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:33,800
Nothing to say

799
00:53:33,800 --> 00:53:35,400
I'm climbing

800
00:53:35,400 --> 00:53:39,400
And I wanna stay in my spirit tonight

00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:13,400
Keeps you alive

802
00:54:43,400 --> 00:54:49,400
In the barrio, you've gotta learn how to survive

803
00:54:49,400 --> 00:54:54,400
Cause you never know when it's your turn to take a dive

804
00:54:54,400 --> 00:55:00,400
So you go, you stay with your eyes in the back of your head

805
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:06,400
You'll never know if you'll be alive or beaten

806
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:12,400
That is one old savage who'll carry on midnight special

807
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:17,400
Never leave, but without it Always better with a midnight version

808
00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:22,400
It's the dark of the street You never know who you're gonna be

809
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:28,400
You're gonna need no more faith, you gotta make that good show

810
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:52,400
Orange Lounge Radio, we put your thing down, flip it and reverse it.

811
00:55:52,400 --> 00:56:08,400
Hey, we're back. Hi, everybody. Yay, I'm in the chair. I did it all by myself, I'm so

812
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:15,400
loud. And I have the ferret too. So what are we going to do? I don't know. Give us a mic

813
00:56:15,400 --> 00:56:18,000
and rub. Well, I wonder, because somebody in the chat room was asking over break, what

814
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:25,960
What is Qsar? Actually, the place is Qsar with a Z and its laser tag, but the reason

815
00:56:25,960 --> 00:56:29,560
why we've been calling it Qsar tonight is because on our little receipt yesterday when

816
00:56:29,560 --> 00:56:34,200
we bought the games, it said Qsar. We were joking. Qsar is hee hee hee, you know, shit

817
00:56:34,200 --> 00:56:40,920
like that. But, what? Well, British was Quasar, wasn't it?

818
00:56:40,920 --> 00:56:45,920
Yeah. Isn't it called Quasar in Britain? Yeah. Jimmy's like, I'm not that big a dork,

819
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:46,920
Okay.

820
00:56:46,920 --> 00:56:54,560
But I actually, you know what, I was talking about how much I suck at Qs are and Loki told

821
00:56:54,560 --> 00:56:56,560
me I had to shut up because I actually did pretty good.

822
00:56:56,560 --> 00:56:58,480
One game I came in second just behind Loki.

823
00:56:58,480 --> 00:56:59,480
I was happy.

824
00:56:59,480 --> 00:57:00,480
Yeah.

825
00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:04,760
It was the solo game too, because I just stood by the headquarters and every time Loki would

826
00:57:04,760 --> 00:57:07,680
shoot enough people that he could go for the headquarters, I'd be there to jump out and

827
00:57:07,680 --> 00:57:09,260
shoot them.

828
00:57:09,260 --> 00:57:12,920
I got the headquarters like three times, almost three times.

829
00:57:12,920 --> 00:57:17,720
I got it twice, and then I got tagged by Ryan at the very end.

830
00:57:17,720 --> 00:57:22,960
I was tagged, and the light was up, and because Black Lab was trying to shoot it, even...

831
00:57:22,960 --> 00:57:23,960
What?

832
00:57:23,960 --> 00:57:27,560
This chat needs to be scrolled down, sorry.

833
00:57:27,560 --> 00:57:29,560
Oh, der.

834
00:57:29,560 --> 00:57:37,480
Sorry to interrupt your story, keep going, my bad.

835
00:57:37,480 --> 00:57:52,480
Alright, anyways, so yeah, I was going to tag it for the second time, but probably didn't understand, I guess, the concept of supercharged, where you have to tag five people without getting tagged, then your gun goes in the rapid fire, then you can tag the headquarters, that's the only way you can tag it.

836
00:57:52,480 --> 00:58:03,480
So, he's standing there blocking me because I'm trying to, like, tag the headquarters, and here he's standing there, had I remembered that you can tag it from the outside, you know, that would have saved me a whole lot more time, but, you know.

837
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:11,480
So no, I had to kind of get tagged a few times, but then I won, I guess.

838
00:58:11,480 --> 00:58:21,480
There was some tubby little kid there that was talking crap, and I beat him down.

839
00:58:21,480 --> 00:58:24,480
Then I was playing DDR later on, and he was like,

840
00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:28,480
Oh my God, you're good at QSR and DDR!

841
00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:30,480
I heard him say that!

842
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:36,200
It was not there. That's funny. Yeah. Even I would have made fun of that. That's cool.

843
00:58:36,200 --> 00:58:42,120
It wasn't as bad as Skater Cowboy. Oh my God. Skater Cowboy was awful. Skater Cowboy was

844
00:58:42,120 --> 00:58:46,480
there last night. I would have laughed. We always think about Skater Cowboy when we think

845
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:53,960
of Vacaville. I wasn't even there. Seriously, every time I go to Vacaville, I look for Skater

846
00:58:53,960 --> 00:58:58,560
Cowboy, but I don't think we'll ever meet him again.

847
00:58:58,560 --> 00:59:01,840
He's just rolling in the wind.

848
00:59:01,840 --> 00:59:07,840
With his cool custom-made DDR Freak skateboard that sucked.

849
00:59:07,840 --> 00:59:13,140
Jamie, do you know if DDR Freak has any officially licensed skateboarding products?

850
00:59:13,140 --> 00:59:14,760
Hell no.

851
00:59:14,760 --> 00:59:15,760
Just checking.

852
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:23,100
I think the only official DDR Freak product there is are the shirts and then that's it.

853
00:59:23,100 --> 00:59:24,760
I thought there were stickers too.

854
00:59:24,760 --> 00:59:25,760
Maybe stickers, maybe.

855
00:59:25,760 --> 00:59:34,280
When you're a freak, you're a freak.

856
00:59:34,280 --> 00:59:38,000
the syringe?

857
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:45,560
You know, I just hadn't been to play in so long, it's just like I kind of forgot what

858
00:59:45,560 --> 00:59:49,920
it was like, but those energizers kind of sucked for me, like I could never get my gun

859
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:53,720
to energize right, and I don't know if it was just that I would keep shaking my gun

860
00:59:53,720 --> 00:59:57,480
in front of it when you had to hold it, but even when I held it, it wouldn't do anything.

861
00:59:57,480 --> 01:00:00,120
It was stupid, I didn't like that.

862
01:00:00,120 --> 01:00:02,480
I guess I'm very impatient.

863
01:00:02,480 --> 01:00:05,480
But it sucks we have to go all the way to Vacaville to play QZAR, because Laser Force

864
01:00:05,480 --> 01:00:06,480
is unacceptable.

865
01:00:06,480 --> 01:00:07,480
That's not laser tag.

866
01:00:07,480 --> 01:00:08,480
That's...

867
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:09,480
Yeah, well...

868
01:00:09,480 --> 01:00:15,200
Yeah, believe it or not, we just drove by the damn, like, why is that place still open?

869
01:00:15,200 --> 01:00:16,200
It smells like pee.

870
01:00:16,200 --> 01:00:17,200
It smells like pee.

871
01:00:17,200 --> 01:00:20,520
You have to understand, because they're the number one laser force place since QZAR left.

872
01:00:20,520 --> 01:00:21,520
They were about to go under...

873
01:00:21,520 --> 01:00:23,520
They're the only laser force...

874
01:00:23,520 --> 01:00:24,520
Imagine...

875
01:00:24,520 --> 01:00:27,760
Well, Laser X is a count, but imagine, imagine if you will...

876
01:00:27,760 --> 01:00:31,440
Okay, Sun Splash is about on the same level as Laser Force, laser tag boy.

877
01:00:31,440 --> 01:00:37,420
talking like you know laser force was in the you know the quicksand going under

878
01:00:37,420 --> 01:00:41,660
no chance or survival whatsoever no chance to survive make your time yeah

879
01:00:41,660 --> 01:00:46,940
then all of a sudden you know Q's are leaves and gasps for air in this like

880
01:00:46,940 --> 01:00:51,540
barely alive and it comes back with a vengeance the only thing I like about

881
01:00:51,540 --> 01:00:56,220
laser force is I love the two-story arena concept I love because you know I

882
01:00:56,220 --> 01:01:00,300
love to play sniper so I love to sit there on the top and help help people at

883
01:01:00,300 --> 01:01:03,620
the bottom. Yes, I'm a camper and I'm proud of it.

884
01:01:03,620 --> 01:01:08,220
I wish we could go play Qsar in Ireland because their Irish rules rock.

885
01:01:08,220 --> 01:01:10,820
Irish rules. Can you club people with a gun? Can you drink

886
01:01:10,820 --> 01:01:15,540
and then play Qsar? Irish rules, there's no neck strap and there's

887
01:01:15,540 --> 01:01:19,460
running. Their arenas are huge and it's like running around in a huge, it's pretty much

888
01:01:19,460 --> 01:01:25,900
like playing paintball because it's just that, it's just crazy and it's the most tiring thing

889
01:01:25,900 --> 01:01:31,320
ever. We played Irish Rules one time when I was there on Tuesday night at that Cuzar

890
01:01:31,320 --> 01:01:38,600
in Vacaville and that was very dangerous. Whoa, what a liability. How did you get away

891
01:01:38,600 --> 01:01:42,500
with doing Irish Rules there? Well, gee, because they don't have any waiver

892
01:01:42,500 --> 01:01:48,820
cards. It doesn't matter anyways. That Cuzar runs so poorly. It's a joke. If anyone got

893
01:01:48,820 --> 01:01:52,820
hurt at all, stubbed to toe or whatever, you could just go and sue that place and it wouldn't

894
01:01:52,820 --> 01:01:53,820
matter.

895
01:01:53,820 --> 01:01:54,820
Hey kids!

896
01:01:54,820 --> 01:01:55,820
Hey kids!

897
01:01:55,820 --> 01:01:56,820
Wanna make money?

898
01:01:56,820 --> 01:02:04,500
Seriously, there's no waiver forms at all, so, I mean, you could.

899
01:02:04,500 --> 01:02:09,460
I should do that as a college student.

900
01:02:09,460 --> 01:02:13,540
Puppies are going to pay off his college loans by suing Cuzar, that's really great.

901
01:02:13,540 --> 01:02:17,780
My leg hurts today, maybe I should sue Cuzar.

902
01:02:17,780 --> 01:02:26,780
Okay, um, the show just kind of came to a screeching halt, I have nothing else to say.

903
01:02:26,780 --> 01:02:32,780
Sorry, I just saw that my, um, BeatMania Complete Mix 2 was done.

904
01:02:32,780 --> 01:02:33,780
Oh, aren't you special.

905
01:02:33,780 --> 01:02:35,780
You want to do the cage match now, Jamie?

906
01:02:35,780 --> 01:02:37,780
Yeah, I want to do the cage match.

907
01:02:37,780 --> 01:02:39,780
Alright, let me get over there and also set up a cage match.

908
01:02:39,780 --> 01:02:42,780
Alright, here, Loki, talk.

909
01:02:42,780 --> 01:02:52,780
So yeah, um, today, or actually not today, a few days ago they, um, finally released the, um, hard drive image of Beat Me at Complete Mix 2.

910
01:02:52,780 --> 01:02:59,780
And that was pretty cool. Bad puppy. Bad puppy.

911
01:02:59,780 --> 01:03:09,780
So anyways, yeah, I just downloaded it, all 47 parts of it, and, uh, now it's gonna unzip. Very slowly. It's gonna take a while.

912
01:03:09,780 --> 01:03:16,780
to make this room complete, you need to transfer to the other room.

913
01:03:39,780 --> 01:04:05,060
p0k3smot42o

914
01:04:05,060 --> 01:04:10,380
a big announcement. Go to your local GameStop and reserve your season 3 Transformers box

915
01:04:10,380 --> 01:04:16,260
set now so you can be cool like me. Cause I have mine reserved. Season 3 is the best

916
01:04:16,260 --> 01:04:23,260
season ever. We all aspire to be as cool as Jamie, don't we? Everybody in the world needs

917
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:28,960
to be as cool as me. You know what, I just met Jamie and Jamie is the coolest chick I've

918
01:04:28,960 --> 01:04:38,720
ever met so hey yeah I'm cool but I have a spirit I sent you a rawr file zero

919
01:04:38,720 --> 01:04:42,000
pre-show dot rawr

920
01:04:43,360 --> 01:04:47,680
because I was cool and decided to upload it so I didn't have to waste any more

921
01:04:47,680 --> 01:04:54,680
I endorse Wind Rar, not Winds Up.

922
01:04:54,680 --> 01:04:57,680
I have it! Here!

923
01:04:57,680 --> 01:05:17,680
The way the cage match works, if you want to vote for a Hollick, that's the first rule.

924
01:05:17,680 --> 01:05:26,680
Second rule, if you want to vote in the cage match, you have to get in our chat room, www.calibomani.com, click on Orange Lounge and click on chat, this is the way it works.

925
01:05:26,680 --> 01:05:32,680
Each of the three lovely hosts of this program, including myself, Sarca, and Loki, bring one song to the table.

926
01:05:32,680 --> 01:05:38,680
And you guys vote on your favorite song, and that song goes into rotation all week long on Orange Lounge Radio.

927
01:05:38,680 --> 01:05:43,680
However, if a song wins for a month straight, it gets taken out.

928
01:05:43,680 --> 01:05:52,680
and guess what I'm a little scared and last week's song that one is now

929
01:05:52,680 --> 01:05:56,800
halfway there last week's winner was Loki song that he picked two weeks ago

930
01:05:56,800 --> 01:06:01,920
but it's still winning and it's every little thing from the cyber trance album

931
01:06:01,920 --> 01:06:08,600
with face the change and this is the above and beyond and dirt devils remix

932
01:06:08,600 --> 01:06:12,640
so you only get a clip of it because it won last week but this song number one

933
01:06:12,640 --> 01:06:16,200
You can vote for tonight every little thing with face the changes. Here you go

934
01:07:42,640 --> 01:07:45,640
It's me and the kid who's in love

935
01:07:45,640 --> 01:07:48,640
Every hour I eat a pizza

936
01:07:48,640 --> 01:07:52,640
Gotta need a game, gotta get there

937
01:08:18,640 --> 01:08:23,320
did it, or what it's called but it's from Raiden. This is one of the best shooting games

938
01:08:23,320 --> 01:08:26,360
ever. I can fill you in on the rest of it because I'm going to read it right off of

939
01:08:26,360 --> 01:08:32,960
the MP3 here. It's Galantry, nobility of spirit. That's what it says. And if you have never

940
01:08:32,960 --> 01:08:37,160
played Raiden, go play Raiden DX because it's the best of the series. Thank you. Alright,

941
01:08:37,160 --> 01:08:44,160
So here's Jamie's pick. It's Ryza with Raiden Gallantry. Enjoy!

942
01:13:37,160 --> 01:13:53,160
kostjamrh And now we get to tear it apart or praise it lots.

943
01:13:53,160 --> 01:13:54,160
whatever you want to do.

944
01:13:54,160 --> 01:13:58,160
It was a really good remix, and the song that I initially picked had already been played,

945
01:13:58,160 --> 01:14:00,160
because I didn't notice the tracklist, and I just went,

946
01:14:00,160 --> 01:14:02,160
oh, this is from Wipeout, and put it in.

947
01:14:02,160 --> 01:14:04,160
I didn't even listen to it.

948
01:14:04,160 --> 01:14:09,160
So, this one, this one, I liked it.

949
01:14:09,160 --> 01:14:11,160
It's a good remix, and it's a great game, you know.

950
01:14:11,160 --> 01:14:13,160
Always been a big fan of the Raiden series,

951
01:14:13,160 --> 01:14:16,160
and figured a lot of people don't appreciate it that much, so I threw it in,

952
01:14:16,160 --> 01:14:19,160
so it gets an A to me.

953
01:14:49,160 --> 01:14:53,160
So I'll give it that. And Raiden is an underrated shooter, so I'll give you that too.

954
01:14:53,160 --> 01:14:57,160
But as a song itself, I love Raiden. I can't see giving it much more than that.

955
01:14:57,160 --> 01:15:01,160
We had a machine at our round table at Rock.

956
01:15:01,160 --> 01:15:05,160
As a song itself, I can't see giving it much more than like...

957
01:15:05,160 --> 01:15:09,160
A 6.66!

958
01:15:09,160 --> 01:15:13,160
A 5.723.

959
01:15:13,160 --> 01:15:17,160
Okay, uh, Bradley?

960
01:15:17,160 --> 01:15:24,160
pretty good but easy to know

961
01:15:25,640 --> 01:15:26,560
yeah

962
01:15:26,560 --> 01:15:31,120
i forgot to listen to it

963
01:15:31,120 --> 01:15:34,120
somebody else taking my chair

964
01:15:34,120 --> 01:15:37,120
look at this guy he's so stupid

965
01:15:37,120 --> 01:15:39,440
stupid guy

966
01:15:39,440 --> 01:15:40,480
what the hell

967
01:15:40,480 --> 01:15:42,200
what are you doing

968
01:15:42,200 --> 01:15:43,960
what am i like

969
01:15:43,960 --> 01:15:48,960
I feel like a lobster from Dick Tracy or something with his cord wrapping around me.

970
01:15:48,960 --> 01:15:53,960
He ain't going nowhere until you spill, spill.

971
01:15:53,960 --> 01:15:54,960
Oh.

972
01:15:54,960 --> 01:15:55,960
No, I think...

973
01:15:55,960 --> 01:15:56,960
Oh.

974
01:15:56,960 --> 01:15:57,960
Okay.

975
01:15:57,960 --> 01:15:58,960
Switching.

976
01:15:58,960 --> 01:15:59,960
Okay.

977
01:15:59,960 --> 01:16:00,960
You dropped it.

978
01:16:00,960 --> 01:16:06,960
Yeah, but you stepped on the cord when you threw it.

979
01:16:06,960 --> 01:16:07,960
Hi, cage match.

980
01:16:07,960 --> 01:16:08,960
Remember me?

981
01:16:08,960 --> 01:16:09,960
Oh, yeah.

982
01:16:09,960 --> 01:16:37,240
p0k3smot42o

983
01:16:37,240 --> 01:16:50,240
I'd like to mention that the Racebase R6 MK3 is the most gay racing chair I have ever seen.

984
01:16:50,240 --> 01:16:54,240
I can vouch for Loki, he does have ADHD.

985
01:16:54,240 --> 01:16:57,240
Hi, I'd like to finish Cage Mansion here, thank you.

986
01:16:57,240 --> 01:16:59,240
I haven't, it's you, but I've never took anything.

987
01:16:59,240 --> 01:17:00,240
Alright.

988
01:17:00,240 --> 01:17:01,240
That would explain it.

989
01:17:01,240 --> 01:17:02,240
Take this.

990
01:17:02,240 --> 01:17:05,240
My turn, my song's turn.

991
01:17:35,240 --> 01:17:42,240
with picking this. So here we go. This is my pick.

992
01:18:05,240 --> 01:18:19,680
Let me show you where I've been You and me, I'll be in the same

993
01:18:19,680 --> 01:18:34,680
Let me tell you where I've been You and me, you and I

994
01:18:34,680 --> 01:18:37,180
The ocean shines so bright

995
01:18:37,180 --> 01:18:39,180
It shines so bright

996
01:18:39,180 --> 01:18:41,180
I don't know what to say, I don't know what to say

997
01:20:11,180 --> 01:20:27,180
🎵

998
01:20:27,180 --> 01:20:29,180
🎵 Come into my dream 🎵

999
01:20:29,180 --> 01:20:47,540
Come into my dream Let me show you where I've been

1000
01:20:47,540 --> 01:20:54,540
It's you and me I've seen Let me tell you what I mean

1001
01:20:54,540 --> 01:20:57,540
In the deep blue skies

1002
01:20:57,540 --> 01:21:01,540
There were rainbows in the night

1003
01:21:01,540 --> 01:21:04,540
Here we need to fly

1004
01:21:04,540 --> 01:21:08,540
And the ocean shines so bright

1005
01:22:08,540 --> 01:22:16,540
Hello, that was Froggy with Comin' to My Dream, Jamie.

1006
01:22:16,540 --> 01:22:22,540
It wasn't bad, but it sounded very, I guess, cookie-cutter, you know?

1007
01:22:22,540 --> 01:22:28,540
The little pauses where it did the little vroom-vroom noise were kind of cool before it set up again,

1008
01:22:28,540 --> 01:22:37,540
but it's not anything that I could really latch onto and concentrate on, so it gets to about a seven, yeah.

1009
01:22:37,540 --> 01:22:48,540
I've heard that song so many times, not even funny.

1010
01:22:48,540 --> 01:22:53,580
But it has Froggy in it, so I was expecting swimming music, and that's what it was.

1011
01:22:53,580 --> 01:23:00,220
Music had me swimming into boredom.

1012
01:23:00,220 --> 01:23:04,740
Now I was kind of tuning that one out too because I heard it so many times, but I was

1013
01:23:04,740 --> 01:23:10,740
I was busy, you know, with renaming zip files and stuff.

1014
01:23:10,740 --> 01:23:13,740
You and that massive porn book.

1015
01:23:13,740 --> 01:23:17,740
Yeah, but this isn't about the porn collection. This is about Beatmania.

1016
01:23:17,740 --> 01:23:20,740
No, it was okay. It was a pretty good song.

1017
01:23:20,740 --> 01:23:28,740
In fact, I think it's better than my song this week, which you should vote out because I have a better one for next week.

1018
01:23:28,740 --> 01:23:30,740
just vote for low-key sister

1019
01:23:32,740 --> 01:23:34,740
chicken dance

1020
01:23:35,740 --> 01:23:37,740
rule number one, can't vote for hollick

1021
01:23:38,740 --> 01:23:44,740
you can however vote for pixie dust hot Kylie Minogue brand underpants if you want

1022
01:23:44,740 --> 01:23:46,740
just a nice check that wasn't a music

1023
01:23:46,740 --> 01:23:48,740
chat room joke, sorry

1024
01:23:49,740 --> 01:23:55,740
it's a cool song, it's a little bit repetitive to me but aren't most songs like that repetitive

1025
01:24:25,740 --> 01:24:48,740
kostjamrh I was listening to that song and I kind of liked it. It was slow in the beginning but I haven't heard many songs like it. But I thought I liked it. So I will have to say a 7.

1026
01:24:48,740 --> 01:24:54,540
Alright, sounds good. Okay. Let's recap kids. Here you go. Send those votes now to sky

1027

Oh several more comment on that song. Okay, and then where's the lyrics?

1028
01:25:00,300 --> 01:25:02,300
I'm so proud of you

1029
01:25:05,780 --> 01:25:10,740
Some days I want to beat you over the head with that ferret repeatedly

1030
01:25:10,740 --> 01:25:24,120
Let's recap, you can vote for one of these three songs.

1031
01:25:24,120 --> 01:25:28,020

right now i feel like sandstorm

1039
01:26:14,860 --> 01:26:17,460

1040
01:26:17,460 --> 01:26:18,820

1042
01:26:23,540 --> 01:26:26,100
yeah this is

1043
01:26:26,100 --> 01:26:27,600
Oh yeah, Bonzai got cancelled.

1044
01:26:27,600 --> 01:26:28,600
Did Bonzai get cancelled?

1045
01:26:28,600 --> 01:26:29,600
It had to have.

1046
01:26:29,600 --> 01:26:30,600
It had to have.

1047
01:26:30,600 --> 01:26:31,600
You know what?

1048
01:26:31,600 --> 01:26:32,600
I don't care.

1049
01:26:32,600 --> 01:26:35,600
That makes things better anyways.

1050
01:26:35,600 --> 01:26:38,600
I'm sorry, puppy, nobody can hear you.

1051
01:26:38,600 --> 01:26:40,600
Hey, is Takeshi's Castle still on?

1052
01:26:40,600 --> 01:26:42,600
What was it, Most Extreme Challenge?

1053
01:26:42,600 --> 01:26:45,600
Yes, Most Extreme Challenge is still on.

1054
01:26:45,600 --> 01:26:50,600
I think I can find original episodes, though, of Takeshi's Castle.

1055
01:26:50,600 --> 01:26:53,600
I want to see those.

1056
01:26:53,600 --> 01:26:57,800
This is from some of the clips that they take out for the Hacked Up show.

1057
01:26:57,800 --> 01:27:02,160
There must be some really incredibly stupid people on that show.

1058
01:27:02,160 --> 01:27:10,680
My favorite clip is the one time that one chick took the soccer ball to the face.

1059
01:27:10,680 --> 01:27:13,680
I like Japanese variety shows.

1060
01:27:13,680 --> 01:27:15,880
I have a tape somewhere in my house.

1061
01:27:15,880 --> 01:27:18,760
By the way, this is the first time I had ever seen any Dragon Ball Z.

1062
01:27:18,760 --> 01:27:20,960
It was taped off of TV in Japan.

1063
01:27:20,960 --> 01:27:23,000
I had Macross 7 on the tape.

1064
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:26,560
giving you an indication of how old this tape is, they had this show on a called...

1065
01:27:26,560 --> 01:27:27,560
Actually, no, I didn't give you the indication.

1066
01:27:27,560 --> 01:27:28,560
I don't remember what it was called.

1067
01:27:28,560 --> 01:27:34,000
It was called like, Udi Nadi Land or something, but they had these interviews and stuff, and

1068
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:40,200
then they had dog soccer, where they tried to get the dog into the net by leading it

1069
01:27:40,200 --> 01:27:45,120
with toys and things, and the dog got tired and took a shit on TV, and then they showed

1070
01:27:45,120 --> 01:27:51,000
a repeat of it, and then they had sit, replay.

1071
01:27:51,000 --> 01:28:06,160
I could totally make a Japanese TV, they just need to let me have no rules whatsoever, just

1072
01:28:06,160 --> 01:28:07,160
let me do it.

1073
01:28:07,160 --> 01:28:11,520
Calvin Ball the show, they need Calvin Ball the show.

1074
01:28:11,520 --> 01:28:12,520
Calvin Ball the show.

1075
01:28:12,520 --> 01:28:13,520
Calvin and Hobbes.

1076
01:28:13,520 --> 01:28:15,520
There is no rules.

1077
01:28:15,520 --> 01:28:19,560
They were trying to get a cow, so then they had a baby dressed up as a soccer ball.

1078
01:28:19,560 --> 01:28:23,360
It was wearing this little black and white checked outfit with a little hat that looked

1079
01:28:23,360 --> 01:28:24,360
like a soccer ball.

1080
01:28:24,360 --> 01:28:25,360
Can I take it?

1081
01:28:25,360 --> 01:28:26,360
And this baby's like...

1082
01:28:26,360 --> 01:28:31,480
The thing is, is that this baby was so cute, because the baby would just sit there, and

1083
01:28:31,480 --> 01:28:34,640
then people would wave something, and the baby would just laugh at him, and then go

1084
01:28:34,640 --> 01:28:36,800
try to wander out of bounds.

1085
01:28:36,800 --> 01:28:41,320
And then they were wiggling things, and the baby was going, ah, baby, and started calling

1086
01:28:41,320 --> 01:28:42,320
across.

1087
01:28:42,320 --> 01:28:43,320
It was pretty funny.

1088
01:28:43,320 --> 01:28:44,320
I'll try to find my tape.

1089
01:28:44,320 --> 01:28:49,280
And I've also got an interview with Jackie Chan on there, and then a made-for-TV movie

1090
01:28:49,280 --> 01:28:52,780
with him on it, so it's cool. Jackie Chan rocks.

1091
01:28:52,780 --> 01:28:59,060
And I have the best Godzilla movie ever because of the man with the CD player in his head.

1092
01:28:59,060 --> 01:29:05,060
Godzilla vs. Mecha Ghidorah. Because the man had a CD player in his head.

1093
01:29:05,060 --> 01:29:10,100
Wow. It's like, he's this android guy, and he's

1094
01:29:10,100 --> 01:29:13,860
the only one who speaks English in the whole movie. It's great. Everything he says is in

1095
01:29:13,860 --> 01:29:16,140
English. Of course, the freak with the CD player in

1096
01:29:16,140 --> 01:29:28,700
in his head is the only one who speaks English. He wasn't Japanese, but I bet all the machinery

1097
01:29:28,700 --> 01:29:36,380
in his head was. I bet it was Sony. It's like he pulls this thing out of his head and it's

1098
01:29:36,380 --> 01:29:42,540
this storage device that pulls CDs in and out and everything. It's like an 18-CD changer

1099
01:29:42,540 --> 01:29:48,900
in his head. It was really cool. He saw, I'm totally ignoring all this chaos.

1100
01:29:48,900 --> 01:29:57,900
I'm listening to Yanni. I saw something else on TV, by the way. This

1101
01:29:57,900 --> 01:29:59,340
was cool. You actually watched TV?

1102
01:29:59,340 --> 01:30:05,100
I watched TV. I was at Julie's house yesterday, and we just happened to watch, what were we

1103
01:30:05,100 --> 01:30:11,440
watching. We watched the Teen Titans on Cartoon Network. It was pretty funny because the intro

1104
01:30:11,440 --> 01:30:20,200
song was done by Puffy. The J-pop group, the girl Puffy. I think she got sued by him for

1105
01:30:20,200 --> 01:30:31,440
using the name. Fuck him. I know. There was some drama a while back, but the opening song

1106
01:30:31,440 --> 01:30:34,360
was done by puffy and it was all in japanese it was cute

1107
01:30:34,360 --> 01:30:36,560
you got a teen titans looks gay from the chat room

1108
01:30:36,560 --> 01:30:42,200
it was funny it was very it was very happy and gay

1109
01:30:42,200 --> 01:30:48,980
no the guy it's like it's done in the style of batman beyond but they do like cutesy manga

1110
01:30:48,980 --> 01:30:52,200
things like like beast boy was doing sweat drops and everything it was cute

1111
01:30:52,200 --> 01:30:57,300
it was really funny don't everybody talk at once

1112
01:30:57,300 --> 01:31:01,420
you guys want to hear who won the cage match no okay okay then we'll go to a break i guess

1113
01:31:01,420 --> 01:31:07,100
the winner tonight, and I thought we were going to have a tie, but we got one vote in

1114
01:31:07,100 --> 01:31:14,100
at the last minute that broke the tie. So tonight's winner, it was a low voting night,

1115
01:31:14,100 --> 01:31:20,500
you guys pissed me off, that's right. Tonight's winner, surprisingly enough, is Broggy with

1116
01:31:20,500 --> 01:31:28,940
Coming to My Dream. Jamie, you were that close, your song just

1117
01:31:28,940 --> 01:31:34,540
had one vote shy and low-key, you only got one vote, so people are sick of that song

1118
01:31:34,540 --> 01:31:35,540
finally.

1119
01:31:35,540 --> 01:31:39,780
Yeah, they got tired of still my words because it's a more Ghost 10th Planet mix.

1120
01:31:39,780 --> 01:31:43,500
And an honorable mention to Hollick.

1121
01:31:43,500 --> 01:31:45,780
Do you mean that Pixie Dust Underwear didn't get any votes?

1122
01:31:45,780 --> 01:31:47,300
Pixie Dust Underwear did not get any votes.

1123
01:31:47,300 --> 01:31:49,740
Oh my God, that's a sin.

1124
01:31:49,740 --> 01:31:53,160
I vote for you.

1125
01:31:53,160 --> 01:31:57,820
I didn't have any voting privileges, so I couldn't vote for the underwear.

1126
01:31:57,820 --> 01:32:02,460
I think we collectively as a non-voting group, because we're all here and only people in

1127
01:32:02,460 --> 01:32:08,580
the chat room can vote, we'll all collectively vote for Pixie Dust in her drawers.

1128
01:32:08,580 --> 01:32:09,580
All of us except you.

1129
01:32:09,580 --> 01:32:10,580
I vote for the ferret.

1130
01:32:10,580 --> 01:32:11,580
Let's go to break.

1131
01:32:11,580 --> 01:32:12,580
Sounds like a good idea.

1132
01:32:12,580 --> 01:32:13,580
Nope, we're happy.

1133
01:32:13,580 --> 01:32:20,580
it

1134
01:32:20,820 --> 01:32:23,740
we would tell you let's go to break

1135
01:32:23,740 --> 01:32:26,260
they're like a good idea

1136
01:32:26,260 --> 01:32:30,540
the

1137
01:32:30,540 --> 01:32:33,260
all right

1138
01:32:33,260 --> 01:32:35,380
this is great

1139
01:32:35,380 --> 01:32:38,980
not going to hurt in hurricane force winds

1140
01:32:38,980 --> 01:32:40,100
will be back

1141
01:32:40,100 --> 01:32:43,540
and after this break i'd actually have some pdr music

1142
01:32:43,540 --> 01:32:45,940
but i don't think i music video news

1143
01:32:45,940 --> 01:32:48,820
because we have home versions coming out very soon we got to talk about there's a

1144
01:32:48,820 --> 01:32:51,300
lot of news on the home versions this week

1145
01:32:51,300 --> 01:32:52,220
and a lot of

1146
01:32:52,220 --> 01:32:55,540
uh... making fun of them that we have to do when we come back

1147
01:32:55,540 --> 01:32:59,100
making fun of staff that's what we do that because that's what we do

1148
01:32:59,100 --> 01:33:00,240

01:33:04,980 --> 01:33:12,180
i want to hear all the songs that everybody hates. I want to hear Cartoon Heroes so we're putting that in. Put Cartoon Heroes in, put Love That Feelin' in.

1152
01:33:12,180 --> 01:33:14,180
Oh God, I don't even know if I can find one of that feeling.

1153
01:33:14,180 --> 01:33:15,180
I'll see if I can...

1154
01:33:15,180 --> 01:33:16,180
Okay.

1155
01:33:16,180 --> 01:33:17,180
Is it?

1156
01:33:17,180 --> 01:33:18,180
Okay.

1157
01:33:18,180 --> 01:33:19,180
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1158
01:33:19,180 --> 01:33:20,180
Go back.

1159
01:33:20,180 --> 01:33:21,180
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1160
01:33:21,180 --> 01:33:22,180
I want...

1161
01:33:22,180 --> 01:33:23,180
Volume 4 in.

1162
01:33:23,180 --> 01:33:24,180
What?

1163
01:33:24,180 --> 01:33:25,180
Volume 4?

1164
01:33:25,180 --> 01:33:26,180
Okay.

1165
01:33:26,180 --> 01:33:27,180
That's enough.

1166
01:33:27,180 --> 01:33:28,180
That's 3.

1167
01:33:28,180 --> 01:33:29,180
Okay.

1168
01:33:29,180 --> 01:33:30,180
Alright.

1169
01:33:30,180 --> 01:33:32,540
We'll be right back after this break.

1170
01:33:32,540 --> 01:33:33,540
Stay tuned.

1171
01:33:33,540 --> 01:33:34,540
You're listening to Orange Launch Radio.

1172
01:33:34,540 --> 01:33:52,540
We are what we're supposed to be, illusions of a fantasy

1173
01:33:52,540 --> 01:33:55,540
All that I'd like to speak or say

1174
01:33:55,540 --> 01:33:58,540
What you do is what you wish to do

1175
01:33:58,540 --> 01:34:01,040
We are the god of symphony

1176
01:34:01,040 --> 01:34:03,540
We do the things you want to see

1177
01:34:03,540 --> 01:34:06,540
Brain by brain to do the extreme

1178
01:34:06,540 --> 01:34:09,540
Our friends are so unreasonable

1179
01:34:09,540 --> 01:34:12,540
They do the unpredictable

1180
01:34:12,540 --> 01:34:14,540
I'd also like to speak and say

1181
01:34:14,540 --> 01:34:17,540
What we do is what you wish to do

1182
01:34:17,540 --> 01:34:20,540
There's no time nor fish for a friend

1183
01:34:20,540 --> 01:34:22,540
Do it on the little bay

1184
01:34:22,540 --> 01:34:25,540
Brain by brain to do the extreme

1185
01:34:25,540 --> 01:34:28,540
We're just one by one, we're making it one

1186
01:34:28,540 --> 01:34:31,540
We are the stars, we're heroes of the world

1187
01:34:31,540 --> 01:34:34,540
We are the ones who are never over

1188
01:34:34,540 --> 01:34:36,540
We're singing by your back, raising minds

1189
01:34:36,540 --> 01:34:39,540
For the ones that are gonna be forever

1190
01:34:39,540 --> 01:34:42,540
Get your body back, and rock it for the end

1191
01:34:42,540 --> 01:34:45,540
We're gonna dream about a true star for it

1192
01:34:45,540 --> 01:34:48,540
We're gonna superman, and never, never, never

1193
01:34:48,540 --> 01:34:51,180
We're one, two, three, two, three, four!

1194
01:35:18,540 --> 01:35:46,540
I feel, I feel

1195
01:35:46,540 --> 01:35:53,540
I can feel it. You are the only one. Let me feel this way.

1196
01:36:04,540 --> 01:36:11,540
I can feel it. I can feel it. I can feel it.

1197
01:36:11,540 --> 01:36:25,540
When I come down, I come down right to the sun

1198
01:36:25,540 --> 01:36:28,040
Hands right down, then right down the bed

1199
01:36:28,040 --> 01:36:30,540
Round and round, scoot right close to the air

1200
01:36:30,540 --> 01:36:34,540
Took just a sec, that's what it's like to come down again

1201
01:36:34,540 --> 01:36:38,040
Keep an edge, nevertheless I'll be fresh to the bed

1202
01:36:38,040 --> 01:36:40,540
Get to the feeling

1203
01:36:40,540 --> 01:36:43,040
I'm taking the pose until nobody knows

1204
01:36:43,040 --> 01:36:45,540
When I'm on my way to get down to the head

1205
01:36:45,540 --> 01:36:47,540
Down, down

1206
01:36:47,540 --> 01:36:51,040
Hands right down the bed

1207
01:36:51,040 --> 01:36:53,040
Just one, two, three, four

1208
01:36:53,040 --> 01:36:55,540
Come on y'all, I've been on before

1209
01:36:55,540 --> 01:36:58,040
Can't write down, can't write down a shit

1210
01:36:58,040 --> 01:37:00,540
I'm rounding out, super close finger

1211
01:37:00,540 --> 01:37:03,040
Come down, check, speed for net

1212
01:37:03,040 --> 01:37:05,040
Get to the fever

1213
01:37:05,040 --> 01:37:08,540
I'm keeping the floor, I'm getting right down to the dirt

1214
01:37:08,540 --> 01:37:10,540
In the dark, I'm kicking to the floor

1215
01:37:10,540 --> 01:37:13,540
Come down, check, speed for net

1216
01:37:13,540 --> 01:37:15,540
Nothing but this, I'm a friend to the best

1217
01:39:15,540 --> 01:39:19,540
The

1218
01:39:19,540 --> 01:39:23,540
The

1219
01:39:23,540 --> 01:39:27,540
The

1220
01:39:27,540 --> 01:39:31,540
The

1221
01:39:31,540 --> 01:39:35,540
The

1222
01:39:35,540 --> 01:39:39,540
The

1223
01:39:39,540 --> 01:39:43,540
The

1224
01:39:43,540 --> 01:40:12,540
We're back, and we're here, and Rob's running around on fire, because he's so hot.

1225
01:40:12,540 --> 01:40:22,280
or be attacked by a giant metallic man ah yeah you know what I'm thinking that

1226
01:40:22,280 --> 01:40:26,280
because the chat room has demanded it we should bring back one of our favorite

1227
01:40:26,280 --> 01:40:31,080
segments match game but not immediately because someone has to write up the

1228
01:40:31,080 --> 01:40:36,000
things for my team so we need to do the FUs of the week that is a very important

1229
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:43,000
thing

1230
01:40:43,480 --> 01:40:44,900
you know why don't you

1231
01:40:44,900 --> 01:40:48,560
conduct the interview so I can get him to be ready

1232
01:40:48,560 --> 01:40:49,920
interview?

1233
01:40:49,920 --> 01:40:51,480
or am I supposed to be interviewing?

1234
01:40:51,480 --> 01:40:52,840
Rob's going to

1235
01:40:52,840 --> 01:40:55,080
let Rob do it, Rob's going to come

1236
01:40:55,080 --> 01:40:57,240
hurry up Rob

1237
01:40:57,240 --> 01:41:00,240
let him count the money and you come over here

1238
01:41:00,240 --> 01:41:01,720
take that mic

1239
01:41:01,720 --> 01:41:04,920
do you need me to write match game or do you want to do it?

1240
01:41:04,920 --> 01:41:09,920
Where is this cord going? It's going under Loki's chair.

1241
01:41:09,920 --> 01:41:14,920
Stop moving your chair around. It's rolling over the cable.

1242
01:41:14,920 --> 01:41:19,920
Stop moving the microphone. You know what?

1243
01:41:19,920 --> 01:41:24,920
I'm going to walk circles around Loki while I do this.

1244
01:41:24,920 --> 01:41:29,920
So, Puppy had a summer job. Where was his summer job at?

1245
01:41:29,920 --> 01:41:36,680
I understand that last month you had a very interesting experience while you were working

1246
01:41:36,680 --> 01:41:38,680
there than at the night shift.

1247
01:41:38,680 --> 01:41:39,680
Yes.

1248
01:41:39,680 --> 01:41:43,120
A little thing that's called armed takeover robbery.

1249
01:41:43,120 --> 01:41:45,760
I know, it's sweet.

1250
01:41:45,760 --> 01:41:49,160
You know what I think is so great about this is that Puppy has such a great sense of humor

1251
01:41:49,160 --> 01:41:52,320
about getting robbed at gunpoint.

1252
01:41:52,320 --> 01:41:54,320
I know, it's kind of funny.

1253
01:41:54,320 --> 01:41:55,760
So what happened?

1254
01:41:55,760 --> 01:41:56,760
What happened?

1255
01:41:56,760 --> 01:42:02,960
It was Sunday night, we closed at 11, but there was this last group of people out on

1256
01:42:02,960 --> 01:42:08,160
the golf courses that was taking fucking forever, because they were trying to like, jump on

1257
01:42:08,160 --> 01:42:12,920
each other and beat each other up while they were golfing, so they left about 11.30, and

1258
01:42:12,920 --> 01:42:17,240
then we closed up the arcade, the other employee that was there left, so it was just me and

1259
01:42:17,240 --> 01:42:18,860
the assistant manager there.

1260
01:42:18,860 --> 01:42:26,720
I went out to clean the bathrooms about 11.40, and then apparently some black truck came

1261
01:42:26,720 --> 01:42:40,240
2 guys come in behind me and I'm like, YOU SHOOT THE FUCK UP RIGHT NOW!

1262
01:42:40,240 --> 01:42:46,240
They were like, okay, whatever. And they both have their guns, they're just kind of nonchalant.

1263
01:42:46,240 --> 01:42:50,240
Were you high off the cleaning fumes? Was that what it is?

1264
01:42:50,240 --> 01:42:56,240
No, it's not that kind of cleaning fumes. It's not those kind of cleaning fluids. I kind of wish it was, though.

1265
01:42:56,240 --> 01:43:05,240
They basically were just like, yeah, we don't want to hurt nobody. Where's the fucking money at? How do we get in? Who else is in there? Typical shit.

1266
01:43:05,240 --> 01:43:14,200
It was funny because the whole time I was just like, not even, I was pretty much ignoring

1267
01:43:14,200 --> 01:43:20,920
the fact that they had guns, because all three of them, they had, let's see, after the first

1268
01:43:20,920 --> 01:43:21,920
two guys came in...

1269
01:43:21,920 --> 01:43:22,920
Were they real guns?

1270
01:43:22,920 --> 01:43:26,440
They probably were real guns, but chances are they weren't even loaded.

1271
01:43:26,440 --> 01:43:31,680
And it was kind of funny because as I was sitting there standing there while the two

1272
01:43:31,680 --> 01:43:34,960
guys with the guns were asking me questions, I saw the third guy come up around the corner

1273
01:43:34,960 --> 01:43:41,960
the building. He comes running around like he's a fucking 007 or something.

1274
01:43:41,960 --> 01:43:46,480
Like he was a Qsar. Yeah, like running around the corner looking

1275
01:43:46,480 --> 01:43:51,680
around like they're trying to see if there's anybody around. Like he's trying to run in

1276
01:43:51,680 --> 01:43:58,080
and tackle somebody. So what happened? They rounded you all up.

1277
01:43:58,080 --> 01:44:04,220
They got me and the assistant manager. They took me around the back through the workroom

1278
01:44:04,220 --> 01:44:09,220
in the back into the manager's office where the assistant manager's in there counting

1279
01:44:09,220 --> 01:44:16,500
money or actually he had just finished counting up all the money for the night and he had

1280
01:44:16,500 --> 01:44:22,460
a bag of money that was sealed up to drop off at the bank so they had us both on the

1281
01:44:22,460 --> 01:44:27,700
floor and they duct taped our hands behind our backs and then dug through and made a

1282
01:44:27,700 --> 01:44:35,220
fucking mess out of everything. And then they took the money, and they took a bucket of

1283
01:44:35,220 --> 01:44:38,420
change that the assistant manager usually keeps with them to take to buy options.

1284
01:44:38,420 --> 01:44:43,140
Well, draw plan tokens. Actually, no. Surprisingly, they didn't take tokens, which was kind of

1285
01:44:43,140 --> 01:44:49,940
funny. What would you do if you stole tokens? That's so sad. I know. It'd be kind of funny

1286
01:44:49,940 --> 01:44:54,400
to see them all take tokens. Are you that hard up for DDR that you have to steal tokens

1287
01:44:54,400 --> 01:44:55,400
a gunpoint.

1288
01:44:55,400 --> 01:44:56,400
Well, they were black.

1289
01:44:56,400 --> 01:44:57,400
I don't think they played DDR.

1290
01:44:57,400 --> 01:44:58,400
I know some...

1291
01:44:58,400 --> 01:44:59,400
There were black teenagers with guns.

1292
01:44:59,400 --> 01:45:00,400
What the hell do you think?

1293
01:45:00,400 --> 01:45:01,400
Well, he didn't have a gun, and he wasn't a teenager.

1294
01:45:01,400 --> 01:45:02,400
Anyway...

1295
01:45:02,400 --> 01:45:03,400
Well, I don't know what you would do with it, Lenny.

1296
01:45:03,400 --> 01:45:17,400
If I was a black teenager with a gun, I'd be playing DDR whenever I want.

1297
01:45:17,400 --> 01:45:20,960
There wouldn't be no fucking line.

1298
01:45:20,960 --> 01:45:21,960
Not with a gun, anyway.

1299
01:45:21,960 --> 01:45:27,360
So they took his bucket of change and he had sets of keys in there. They threw out two

1300
01:45:27,360 --> 01:45:33,320
of his three sets of keys. One of the keys was actually the set of keys to all the doors

1301
01:45:33,320 --> 01:45:38,600
and all the games and stuff inside the arcade. They didn't take those. They accidentally

1302
01:45:38,600 --> 01:45:48,080
took his car keys. Now he can't get into his car and he has to walk home. By the time this

1303
01:45:48,080 --> 01:45:51,580
whole ordeal was done with the cops getting there and everything. It was like almost two

1304
01:45:51,580 --> 01:45:52,580
in the morning.

1305
01:45:52,580 --> 01:45:55,580
They made off with about $4,700.

1306
01:45:55,580 --> 01:45:56,580
That's it?

1307
01:45:56,580 --> 01:46:06,220
I don't seem like that much. That's all the golf I make? Shit.

1308
01:46:06,220 --> 01:46:20,820
It's Castro Valley, we're not fucking Milpitas or Roseville, can you imagine how much money

1309
01:46:20,820 --> 01:46:22,380
that place was making today?

1310
01:46:22,380 --> 01:46:24,260
But they have a security job.

1311
01:46:24,260 --> 01:46:33,540
Not that we would advocate robbing, maybe vandalism, no, we're not advocating those

1312
01:46:33,540 --> 01:46:38,820
Those things were a good, polite show, but if you want to trip some little kids while

1313
01:46:38,820 --> 01:46:42,740
you're there, feel free.

1314
01:46:42,740 --> 01:46:45,300
Just don't damage their property, because we don't advocate that, because we don't want

1315
01:46:45,300 --> 01:46:46,300
to get sued.

1316
01:46:46,300 --> 01:46:49,700
Trip a little kids all you want, though.

1317
01:46:49,700 --> 01:46:53,740
And then tell the kids to have their parents sue Golf Land.

1318
01:46:53,740 --> 01:47:00,180
Okay, so the funny part was, as they left, they called the cops.

1319
01:47:30,180 --> 01:47:33,940
If they were to actually try, if they would have undone that, and there was just one of

1320
01:47:33,940 --> 01:47:37,780
them in the room, I would have probably kicked the people, the really crap out of him.

1321
01:47:37,780 --> 01:47:43,260
Because, I mean, I could defend myself against one person, but not three, and it was.

1322
01:47:43,260 --> 01:47:46,540
And then there would have been, if also the gun that he had would have been loaded, then

1323
01:47:46,540 --> 01:47:47,780
I could, you know, just use that.

1324
01:47:47,780 --> 01:47:48,780
Okay.

1325
01:47:48,780 --> 01:47:52,820
And then that's the whole dream sequence thing.

1326
01:47:52,820 --> 01:47:59,420
Enter dream sequence, and I killed all the two guys, and I'm the hero, and yeah.

1327
01:47:59,420 --> 01:48:03,420
Lokey called him a loser.

1328
01:48:03,420 --> 01:48:05,420
I don't blame him.

1329
01:48:05,420 --> 01:48:09,420
So did you get anything from, um, Castro Valley Golf Club from getting robbed?

1330
01:48:09,420 --> 01:48:11,420
Was it like, you know, did you get at least a card?

1331
01:48:11,420 --> 01:48:13,420
You know, sorry to hear you were robbed at gunpoint.

1332
01:48:13,420 --> 01:48:15,420
Yeah, here's, no.

1333
01:48:15,420 --> 01:48:18,420
Why don't you take tomorrow off? Did you get anything like that?

1334
01:48:18,420 --> 01:48:22,420
I took, I intentionally took the next day off.

1335
01:48:22,420 --> 01:48:26,420
But then again, did you call in and emotionally scarred to work?

1336
01:48:26,420 --> 01:48:27,420
No, I would have.

1337
01:48:27,420 --> 01:48:33,120
Well actually it was more like I needed to go out of the DMV because the fuckers took

1338
01:48:33,120 --> 01:48:34,120
our driver's license.

1339
01:48:34,120 --> 01:48:39,880
They took out both of our wallets, go through them, and take out just the driver's license.

1340
01:48:39,880 --> 01:48:43,600
No cash, no credit cards, no anything else.

1341
01:48:43,600 --> 01:48:44,960
Just our driver's licenses.

1342
01:48:44,960 --> 01:48:50,200
I mean, because that would have done them a lot of good to have your driver's license

1343
01:48:50,200 --> 01:48:52,520
because you look just like a black teenager and all.

1344
01:48:52,520 --> 01:48:53,520
Yeah, I know.

1345
01:48:53,520 --> 01:49:09,960
I ended up spending three hours at the DMV the next day to get my new driver's license

1346
01:49:09,960 --> 01:49:16,020
and out of all of it I got a new picture of my driver's license and now my picture looks

1347
01:49:16,020 --> 01:49:20,760
much better and more like me instead of me at 10 a.m.

1348
01:49:50,760 --> 01:50:11,760
Yeah, and you know what pisses me off about this emulator? Is that, um, no, here's what the thing is. It's like, okay, I've got the hard drive image for the Japanese version of Complete Mix 2, yet I have the ROM for the US version of Complete Mix 2, and they don't work together.

1349
01:50:11,760 --> 01:50:12,760
Ooh, that's not good.

1350
01:50:12,760 --> 01:50:17,760
No, they do for, um, it's weird because they do for Complete Mix 1, but I don't know why it's not working for Complete Mix 2.

1351
01:50:17,760 --> 01:50:29,760
hip hop mania is the same thing is this a different rom same hard drive image

1352
01:50:47,760 --> 01:50:52,760
So, let's, um, we're gonna go to a break and then come back and do the FUs.

1353
01:50:52,760 --> 01:50:55,760
Let's do, okay, let's do the FUs now.

1354
01:50:55,760 --> 01:50:57,760
The chat room can submit them while we're doing ours.

1355
01:50:57,760 --> 01:51:02,760
Oh wait, no, she's gonna put the music up herself, okay.

1356
01:51:02,760 --> 01:51:07,760
No, it's just gonna take a second here.

1357
01:51:07,760 --> 01:51:11,760
So, if you want to submit an FU of the Week chat room, just send those over a private message to me right now.

1358
01:51:11,760 --> 01:51:15,760
You can send those in while we're doing ours.

1359
01:51:15,760 --> 01:51:20,760
Usually I give you guys a break, but people don't start sending them in anyway until they hear us doing ours.

1360
01:51:20,760 --> 01:51:25,760
So, I don't think it does it all good anyway, so forget it.

1361
01:51:25,760 --> 01:51:29,760
So, Jamie, what happens during the FUs of the Week?

1362
01:51:29,760 --> 01:51:31,760
It's when we bitch about stuff.

1363
01:51:31,760 --> 01:51:33,760
Well, here we go.

1364
01:51:33,760 --> 01:51:54,480
My first nephew of the week goes toward mixed auto sales in Roseville, and they're out of

1365
01:51:54,480 --> 01:51:56,320
business now the bitches.

1366
01:51:56,320 --> 01:51:58,040
I bought my car from them.

1367
01:51:58,040 --> 01:52:02,240
My car had a low idle, but he assured me, you know, it's fine, we can fix it.

1368
01:52:02,240 --> 01:52:04,240
Now my engine is dead!

1369
01:52:04,240 --> 01:52:08,240
Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, fuck you!

1370
01:52:08,240 --> 01:52:10,240
I love my car, and now it's shit.

1371
01:52:10,240 --> 01:52:12,240
Fuck him a whole lot.

1372
01:52:12,240 --> 01:52:17,240
And I can't even begin to say how mad I am over this.

1373
01:52:17,240 --> 01:52:20,240
Who all has been in my car with me?

1374
01:52:20,240 --> 01:52:23,240
Who all knows how much I love my car?

1375
01:52:23,240 --> 01:52:27,240
Okay, I love my car, and now it's shit.

1376
01:52:27,240 --> 01:52:30,240
So, I hope he eats shit.

1377
01:52:30,240 --> 01:52:34,240
and then, and then poops it, and then has it

1378
01:52:34,240 --> 01:52:36,240
Well, he's obviously bankrupt

1379
01:52:36,240 --> 01:52:42,240
No, I want, I want him to eat shit, poop it, and then have it fed intravenously to him

1380
01:52:44,240 --> 01:52:46,240
Wow

1381
01:52:46,240 --> 01:52:48,240
Wow

1382
01:52:48,240 --> 01:52:54,240
And then, and then, I want all of the, the shit blood drained from him

1383
01:52:54,240 --> 01:52:59,240
and then given to him as a suppository

1384
01:52:59,240 --> 01:53:03,240
I want him to have a bloodshed enema, because I'm so mad.

1385
01:53:03,240 --> 01:53:06,240
This is such a tasteful show this evening, I'm so excited.

1386
01:53:06,240 --> 01:53:08,240
I am so pissed, no, no.

1387
01:53:08,240 --> 01:53:10,240
I don't even get started when I'm really pissed off.

1388
01:53:10,240 --> 01:53:13,240
When I am really, really, really pissed off,

1389
01:53:13,240 --> 01:53:16,240
I think of the most foul and horrible things that will happen to people,

1390
01:53:16,240 --> 01:53:18,240
and then imagine them.

1391
01:53:18,240 --> 01:53:22,240
So this is me at work Friday, thinking of all kinds of foul,

1392
01:53:22,240 --> 01:53:26,240
and I've had days to think of how I want this man to die.

1393
01:53:26,240 --> 01:53:33,240
I could come up with so many good tortures, but the thing is, is that just killing him wouldn't be enough.

1394
01:53:33,240 --> 01:53:36,240
Because when you're dead, you can't hurt a dead person anymore.

1395
01:53:36,240 --> 01:53:40,240
Unless you pull their soul from the bowels of hell.

1396
01:53:40,240 --> 01:53:48,240
But usually the bowels of hell are even worse than what any single person alive could imagine.

1397
01:53:48,240 --> 01:53:54,440
Just have a defibrillator handy so that when he actually dies, like you wait five minutes

1398
01:53:54,440 --> 01:53:57,800
then bring him back to life and kill him again.

1399
01:53:57,800 --> 01:54:00,160
And you can't do that much damage to somebody though.

1400
01:54:00,160 --> 01:54:04,080
And you'd have to like freeze them to death and then warm up and you know thaw them out

1401
01:54:04,080 --> 01:54:05,640
like a TV did or, ooh microwave.

1402
01:54:05,640 --> 01:54:09,320
But you know you could like stick his hand in the microwave and then trigger it to where

1403
01:54:09,320 --> 01:54:10,320
his hand would explode.

1404
01:54:10,320 --> 01:54:11,320
You'd live through that.

1405
01:54:11,320 --> 01:54:15,160
You'd have a little bit of radiation poisoning but you'd live.

1406
01:54:15,160 --> 01:54:23,560
know I'm mad I'm mad I'm very mad I'm mad that my antibiotics have done

1407
01:54:23,560 --> 01:54:28,100
nothing that make me sick all week but I took the last one today so I'm

1408
01:54:28,100 --> 01:54:33,520
officially healthy but I still have to take all the other crap and my nose is still

1409
01:54:33,520 --> 01:54:37,000
running so I didn't do crap for that

1410
01:54:38,520 --> 01:54:44,960
and then and yes I love my car I said I love my car I deal with it I love my

1411
01:54:44,960 --> 01:54:52,040
car. And then, fuck Nissan. Because I asked them if they would order me a Skyline and

1412
01:54:52,040 --> 01:55:00,520
they said no. I want one. They said no. They won't. The dealerships will not actually import

1413
01:55:00,520 --> 01:55:05,240
the cars. You have to go buy them yourself and ship it yourself. Which is fine because

1414
01:55:05,240 --> 01:55:10,960
I know a place I can get one for $60,000. If I had $60,000 more, I'd go to my bank.

1415
01:55:10,960 --> 01:55:12,480
Hey, give me $60,000.

1416
01:55:12,480 --> 01:55:14,320
I need to order me a car.

1417
01:55:14,320 --> 01:55:18,200
I'm going to be like, uh, no.

1418
01:55:18,200 --> 01:55:19,520
Sure, you can have it.

1419
01:55:19,520 --> 01:55:23,360
But here's a 20% interest rate while we

1420
01:55:23,360 --> 01:55:25,440
steal your firstborn, your liver, and your kidneys

1421
01:55:25,440 --> 01:55:27,680
and sell them in New Orleans on the market.

1422
01:55:31,600 --> 01:55:34,160
Well, yeah, it'd be great.

1423
01:55:34,160 --> 01:55:35,840
I'll say, you can have my firstborn,

1424
01:55:35,840 --> 01:55:37,240
and then I just won't breathe.

1425
01:55:37,240 --> 01:55:37,840
So I'm cool.

1426
01:55:37,840 --> 01:55:40,800
I'll speak our hate.

1427
01:55:40,800 --> 01:55:46,560
And then, you know, if I have my computer, it does this weird thing, and I don't know why,

1428
01:55:47,160 --> 01:55:54,500
where it will not save my image files as a JPEG or a GIF as they're uploaded on their site's house.

1429
01:55:54,840 --> 01:55:58,660
It will save it as a bitmap, un-titled bitmap, so I have to title everything.

1430
01:55:58,660 --> 01:56:02,000
And then I have to go through and get, I have tons of bitmaps on my computer now,

1431
01:56:02,000 --> 01:56:04,120
so it's taking up more space than it needs to, but then again I have

1432
01:56:04,120 --> 01:56:05,440
that 120 gig hard drive, so I'm fine.

1433
01:56:05,440 --> 01:56:15,440
And then, and then, you know, there's just really not a lot else.

1434
01:56:15,440 --> 01:56:17,080
I can't really think of anything else.

1435
01:56:17,080 --> 01:56:20,160
It's really my car and my car makes me cry.

1436
01:56:20,160 --> 01:56:28,040
And oh yeah, a big, big F-you to Phantasy Star Online for freezing when I was going

1437
01:56:28,040 --> 01:56:29,040
into the ruins.

1438
01:56:29,040 --> 01:56:33,320
And they were just like, okay, we've gone to TGI Fridays and left our games on idle

1439
01:56:33,320 --> 01:56:36,760
And I had the cord holding down my analog button on the menu

1440
01:56:36,760 --> 01:56:39,960
so they would keep scrolling through the menu and would log me off.

1441
01:56:39,960 --> 01:56:43,280
I'm smart, see? Xbox.

1442
01:56:43,280 --> 01:56:45,760
I have the GameCube on too.

1443
01:56:45,760 --> 01:56:50,120
Entering that. No.

1444
01:56:50,120 --> 01:56:53,560
You can't do GameCube to Xbox. It does.

1445
01:56:53,560 --> 01:56:54,560
That's a waste of money.

1446
01:56:54,560 --> 01:56:57,240
If I remember right, they have

1447
01:56:57,240 --> 01:57:00,880
different classes. GameCube has a class, a separate class of its own.

1448
01:57:00,880 --> 01:57:02,720
Xbox has a separate class of its own.

1449
01:57:02,720 --> 01:57:03,720
I have the same one.

1450
01:57:03,720 --> 01:57:04,720
Oh.

1451
01:57:04,720 --> 01:57:05,720
Well, then it sucks.

1452
01:57:05,720 --> 01:57:07,720
The Xbox one has more outfits.

1453
01:57:07,720 --> 01:57:08,720
Oh.

1454
01:57:08,720 --> 01:57:15,040
But at any rate, I came back and Julie got logged off.

1455
01:57:15,040 --> 01:57:16,040
I stayed on.

1456
01:57:16,040 --> 01:57:17,880
So our room was intact.

1457
01:57:17,880 --> 01:57:19,960
And then so she logs on and everything.

1458
01:57:19,960 --> 01:57:22,760
And then as we're going down to the planet, my game freezes.

1459
01:57:22,760 --> 01:57:28,880
And I can't catch all my equipped items, including my Devil Wing Mags and all my Alrappies and

1460
01:57:28,880 --> 01:57:37,200
my God battle and my cross guards and everything, but I lost my flight plan and I lost all of

1461
01:57:37,200 --> 01:57:41,680
my crap items. The thing is that I have max money, so it was kind of cool. It was just

1462
01:57:41,680 --> 01:57:48,080
aggravating having to go get all that stuff. I went up five levels that night. It was great.

1463
01:57:48,080 --> 01:57:54,040
Six levels. I went up six levels. Then we did Endless Nightmare and that was cool.

1464
01:57:54,040 --> 01:58:15,120
I have to give an F.U. to Pepsi for making a vanilla Pepsi that tastes so damn good because

1465
01:58:15,120 --> 01:58:16,680
I hate Pepsi.

1466
01:58:16,680 --> 01:58:18,360
Vanilla Pepsi is the best.

1467
01:58:18,360 --> 01:58:20,880
What did I say when vanilla Coke came out?

1468
01:58:20,880 --> 01:58:22,400
I said, can't wait for vanilla Pepsi.

1469
01:58:22,400 --> 01:58:23,400
Here it is.

1470
01:58:23,400 --> 01:58:31,080
that same cokey aftertaste so and another at you goes toward my lifestyle

1471
01:58:31,080 --> 01:58:37,600
adjustment because on the outside it looks successful but not when I stepped

1472
01:58:37,600 --> 01:58:42,240
on the scale so I'm using my gym membership now and fuck everybody who

1473
01:58:42,240 --> 01:58:45,640
will go to the gym with me I hate you

1474
01:58:46,360 --> 01:58:50,280
okay I don't hate you I was kidding I know but I hate the guy who's holding my

1475
01:58:50,280 --> 01:59:00,840
car. I don't want him dead. I need a basement. Oh my god, I need a basement. If I had a basement,

1476
01:59:00,840 --> 01:59:04,840
I could still set up the perfect torture chamber there. I can see Jamie there right now. It

1477
01:59:04,840 --> 01:59:18,880
puts the lotion on its skin and puts it in the basket. And, oh yeah, fuck CD Japan for

1478
01:59:18,880 --> 01:59:25,000
making the pre-order for battle royale 2, 80 bucks, what? You should see how much it

1479
01:59:25,000 --> 01:59:31,520
is on yesasia.com. Fuck that shit. I'm just going to see if anime jungle Osaka can order

1480
01:59:31,520 --> 01:59:37,680
it for me, because I'll at least get it for 60 there. Because Jamie actually collects

1481
01:59:37,680 --> 01:59:42,600
the real thing. I buy the real thing so I can watch it on my big TV with my DVD player

1482
01:59:42,600 --> 01:59:50,600
over and over and over again, and then I can copy the DVDs for my friends and get a nice transfer.

1483
01:59:50,600 --> 01:59:51,600
What an angel.

1484
01:59:51,600 --> 01:59:52,600
Okay, next.

1485
01:59:52,600 --> 01:59:54,600
Loki, your turn.

1486
01:59:54,600 --> 01:59:59,600
Mario Golf?

1487
01:59:59,600 --> 02:00:02,600
Mario Golf is cool!

1488
02:00:02,600 --> 02:00:03,600
Shut up, loser.

1489
02:00:03,600 --> 02:00:09,600
Anyways, first I'm going to start off with a big F2 speedy oil change because you suck,

1490
02:00:09,600 --> 02:00:21,600
The fact that you made me wait four hours to get my tune-up the first time, then I come to find out you ripped me off on the tune-up, then you break my car, speedy oil change.

1491
02:00:21,600 --> 02:00:24,600
They suck, so you know, a few of them.

1492
02:00:24,600 --> 02:00:28,600
I should have gotten a clue when I saw a bunch of teenagers working there.

1493
02:00:28,600 --> 02:00:31,600
Teenagers can't fix anything. They suck.

1494
02:00:31,600 --> 02:00:35,600
It's like auto-shop. That's what it was. It was just auto-shop.

1495
02:00:35,600 --> 02:00:39,600
They have taken my car to auto-shop and having them fix it.

1496
02:00:39,600 --> 02:00:42,600
Well, we replaced your engine for you.

1497
02:00:42,600 --> 02:00:44,600
I just wanted a tune-up.

1498
02:00:47,600 --> 02:00:50,600
I thought you wanted us to put a lawnmower engine in there.

1499
02:00:50,600 --> 02:00:57,600
kostjamrh Why do I hear Ultimate Cheeseburger?

1500
02:01:20,600 --> 02:01:21,600
That's unacceptable.

1501
02:01:21,600 --> 02:01:22,600
Oh, bloop!

1502
02:01:22,600 --> 02:01:27,600
F you too, stupid people who can't drive.

1503
02:01:27,600 --> 02:01:32,600
And normally those people that turn out in front of me and then go slow.

1504
02:01:32,600 --> 02:01:33,600
Oh, and another thing.

1505
02:01:33,600 --> 02:01:39,600
If you're driving a ricer, you should not be going slower than I am, okay?

1506
02:01:39,600 --> 02:01:43,600
You're in a souped up car, supposedly.

1507
02:01:43,600 --> 02:01:52,600
Remember, the typical rice car, rice mobile now, has like, you know, a stupid four banger in it, and a hole in the muffler to sound hot.

1508
02:01:52,600 --> 02:01:54,600
And then just like, just a plastic box.

1509
02:01:54,600 --> 02:01:57,600
Yeah, but they had already just did all the, like, body modifications to it.

1510
02:01:57,600 --> 02:02:01,600
Haven't quite painted it yet, but they've done all the body modifications for it.

1511
02:02:01,600 --> 02:02:04,600
And, um, they were going really slow, in the slow lane.

1512
02:02:04,600 --> 02:02:08,600
And I was trying to pass them, because I was trying to, you know, go home.

1513
02:02:08,600 --> 02:02:12,600
Have you ever tried doing that to somebody? It's a blast.

1514
02:02:12,600 --> 02:02:14,600
i hate, i hate that

1515
02:02:42,600 --> 02:02:48,600
After the radio check, because you suck, I bought S-Video cables to hook up the TV today.

1516
02:02:48,600 --> 02:02:51,600
First off, they don't sell anything larger than 12 feet for S-Video.

1517
02:02:51,600 --> 02:03:00,600
Sure, they have 100-foot regular AV cables, but no, we don't have S-Video cables that are larger than 12 feet.

1518
02:03:00,600 --> 02:03:07,600
So I had to buy two S-Video cables and a connector for the two of them.

1519
02:03:07,600 --> 02:03:10,600
That cost $45.

1520
02:03:10,600 --> 02:03:12,600
Holy crap!

1521
02:03:40,600 --> 02:03:53,960
My turn. F you to people that aren't willing to drive 10 miles over the speed limit on

1522
02:03:53,960 --> 02:03:57,920
windy roads because that's what they're built for is going fast. Word.

1523
02:03:57,920 --> 02:04:05,520
An F you as well to the fact that it's easy to climb up a rock. You handed the mic to

1524
02:04:05,520 --> 02:04:22,520
If you did the fact that it's easy to climb up a rock, but it's not easy to get down, jumping is not an option.

1525
02:04:22,520 --> 02:04:27,400
You know wasting all that time and energy humping the rock. You know that I did not have the rock

1526
02:04:28,120 --> 02:04:33,320
As you did that lady who made us while a stand guard while she took a pee behind the rock

1527
02:04:37,720 --> 02:04:43,080
I almost did I had to have a picture of her somewhere and then when you see what this woman looks like you'll understand

1528
02:04:43,080 --> 02:04:45,080
Why I did not want to get a picture of her pain

1529
02:04:45,920 --> 02:04:48,000
Behind the rock oh my god

1530
02:04:48,000 --> 02:04:55,000
the

1531
02:04:56,860 --> 02:05:00,860
the

1532
02:05:00,860 --> 02:05:05,440
kids run over

1533
02:05:05,440 --> 02:05:10,200
and that you also to uh... the back of the arcade stars because that the your

1534
02:05:10,200 --> 02:05:11,680
machine

1535
02:05:11,680 --> 02:05:15,000
dot this is why should not be getting this is an i could have been able to go

1536
02:05:45,000 --> 02:05:48,800
And I might add, the DDR is broken.

1537
02:05:48,800 --> 02:05:51,160
All of them.

1538
02:05:51,160 --> 02:05:54,280
Yeah, but all the arrows, like, suck on DDR now,

1539
02:05:54,280 --> 02:05:56,240
so I can't play doubles or anything.

1540
02:05:56,240 --> 02:05:58,320
But, like, the shooting gallery, so you're playing 2DX,

1541
02:05:58,320 --> 02:06:01,160
you know, it's all, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da.

1542
02:06:01,160 --> 02:06:02,280
What's that noise?

1543
02:06:02,280 --> 02:06:03,840
Oh, that was someone shooting at us.

1544
02:06:03,840 --> 02:06:07,120
Oh, you shot me.

1545
02:06:07,120 --> 02:06:08,480
That's the shooting range.

1546
02:06:08,480 --> 02:06:10,520
Like, all of a sudden, I'm playing sync, right?

1547
02:06:10,520 --> 02:06:12,200
I have a 200-something combo going.

1548
02:06:12,200 --> 02:06:15,200
And then all of a sudden, oh, you shot me!

1549
02:06:15,200 --> 02:06:17,200
And bam, combo broken.

1550
02:06:17,200 --> 02:06:19,200
It's playing slag work.

1551
02:06:19,200 --> 02:06:21,200
You hear, oh, you got me.

1552
02:06:21,200 --> 02:06:23,200
That's fucked up.

1553
02:06:23,200 --> 02:06:24,200
That's how it was.

1554
02:06:24,200 --> 02:06:26,200
I wish the timing was just that good.

1555
02:06:26,200 --> 02:06:30,200
A few people at Paramount that thought it was a good idea

1556
02:06:30,200 --> 02:06:33,200
to do yet another movie about Tupac.

1557
02:06:33,200 --> 02:06:35,200
Yes, they're making another Tupac movie.

1558
02:06:35,200 --> 02:06:37,200
Tupac Resurrection.

1559
02:06:37,200 --> 02:06:44,200
I'm sorry. That's cool. That's cool.

1560
02:06:45,200 --> 02:06:52,200
Dude, Tupac gets more sequels than Batman. We're all going to go opening day.

1561
02:06:52,200 --> 02:06:57,200
Tupac resurrection opening day. Hey, seriously.

1562
02:06:57,200 --> 02:07:04,200
It's going to be fulsome. Come on. Anyway.

1563
02:07:04,200 --> 02:07:10,000
So yeah, that sucks and I'm trying to think what oh, yeah f you too

1564
02:07:11,940 --> 02:07:14,440
Pretty much Oh f you the fat bitch

1565
02:07:14,440 --> 02:07:16,440
Oh the stupid kid that was actually

1566
02:07:16,600 --> 02:07:21,680
Asking begging for money while playing DDR and they kept getting louder and louder because I was ignoring him

1567
02:07:22,360 --> 02:07:23,800
What?

1568
02:07:23,800 --> 02:07:30,800
Do you have a dog as I can have no do you have any tokens I have? No, why is it through my chair again?

1569
02:07:30,800 --> 02:07:39,060
p0k3smot42o1

1570
02:07:39,060 --> 02:07:43,060
p0k3smot42o1

1571
02:07:43,060 --> 02:07:49,060
p0k3smot42o

1572
02:07:49,060 --> 02:07:56,060
p0k3smot42o

1573
02:07:56,060 --> 02:08:24,060
p0k3smot42o i have satan

1574
02:08:24,060 --> 02:08:30,060
you will die your chair has been liberated from the microphone

1575
02:08:30,060 --> 02:08:32,060
cord f either john ritter dying

1576
02:08:32,060 --> 02:08:35,060
doesn't he know that he has entertainment he has to do

1577
02:08:35,060 --> 02:08:37,060
why does he have to go off heart problems now

1578
02:08:37,060 --> 02:08:39,060
it's because he wasn't eating enough bacon

1579
02:08:39,060 --> 02:08:43,060
he has to condition his heart for bad food

1580
02:08:43,060 --> 02:08:45,060
i blame him

1581
02:08:45,060 --> 02:08:47,060
actually i blame suzanne summers

1582
02:08:47,060 --> 02:08:49,060
it was all her fault

1583
02:08:49,060 --> 02:08:51,860
Suzanne Somers is the death of him.

1584
02:08:51,860 --> 02:08:54,380
John Ritter sucked anyway.

1585
02:08:54,380 --> 02:08:56,860
I grew up with the Reese Company, hello.

1586
02:08:56,860 --> 02:08:59,420
But it was Suzanne Somers.

1587
02:08:59,420 --> 02:09:02,860
When I read that he died, the only thing that I could think of was this movie that I saw on TV.

1588
02:09:02,860 --> 02:09:05,500
If you have to be stuck on an island,

1589
02:09:05,500 --> 02:09:08,460
fighting off Indians with either Suzanne Somers

1590
02:09:08,460 --> 02:09:13,100
or John Ritter, you will want John Ritter on your side.

1591
02:09:13,100 --> 02:09:17,020
Suzanne Somers would be scarier.

1592
02:09:17,020 --> 02:09:18,060
Am I right?

1593
02:09:18,060 --> 02:09:23,060
Yeah, but that's the whole point. All you have to do is start crying and talking about the starving children in China.

1594
02:09:23,060 --> 02:09:27,060
Oh, and the other thing, the FU segment left like ten minutes ago.

1595
02:09:27,060 --> 02:09:28,060
I got one more.

1596
02:09:28,060 --> 02:09:39,060
Okay, FU to J-Lo and Ben Affleck, because guess what, your marriage lasted as long as Geely did in the box office.

1597
02:09:39,060 --> 02:09:41,060
Bam!

1598
02:09:41,060 --> 02:09:44,060
You suck. They broke up.

1599
02:09:44,060 --> 02:09:47,060
Because he had second thoughts. He's like, dude, I don't know if I can marry her.

1600
02:09:47,060 --> 02:09:51,060
He's such a pansy.

1601
02:09:51,060 --> 02:09:53,060
Her ass comes alive at night.

1602
02:09:53,060 --> 02:09:56,060
No, I can't handle it.

1603
02:09:56,060 --> 02:10:01,060
I'm looking at a bunch of straight men talking about the wedding of Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez.

1604
02:10:01,060 --> 02:10:04,060
I can't believe they're now going to get married.

1605
02:10:04,060 --> 02:10:05,060
Gay.

1606
02:10:05,060 --> 02:10:07,060
Thank you for picking that.

1607
02:10:07,060 --> 02:10:11,060
The other ironic thing is that I could give less than a shit about them.

1608
02:10:11,060 --> 02:10:14,060
I don't fucking care. I don't care what the bitch is wearing.

1609
02:10:14,060 --> 02:10:21,060
I don't care where they're getting married. I don't care if they broke up. I don't care if they mate. I don't care. Let's watch some guns.

1610
02:10:21,060 --> 02:10:24,060
It's a good thing because they're not going to breed now.

1611
02:10:24,060 --> 02:10:32,060
And you know what's funny is NASA's crashing a 1.5 billion dollar satellite or whatever or probe into a house.

1612
02:10:32,060 --> 02:10:38,060
Into their house? No, into Jupiter because they're afraid that bacteria might infect the moon around Jupiter.

1613
02:11:08,060 --> 02:11:14,100
I hope there's an evolving civilization on Jupiter, and it crushes them all.

1614
02:11:14,100 --> 02:11:18,260
It would be in Jupiter, because Jupiter's a big gaseous mass.

1615
02:11:18,260 --> 02:11:21,580
Much like Suzanne Somers, okay.

1616
02:11:21,580 --> 02:11:25,060
Again, bam.

1617
02:11:25,060 --> 02:11:26,060
You're so punny.

1618
02:11:26,060 --> 02:11:28,740
Oh, is it my turn?

1619
02:11:28,740 --> 02:11:29,660
Room's turn.

1620
02:11:29,660 --> 02:11:36,700
I've got a couple of FUs, a couple of political FUs, actually.

1621
02:11:36,700 --> 02:11:39,080
F you to uh...

1622
02:11:39,080 --> 02:11:40,660
to uh... what's-her-name

1623
02:11:40,660 --> 02:11:44,700
that one chick who's not getting any votes for not getting any votes i i i

1624
02:11:44,700 --> 02:11:46,620

uh...

1626
02:11:49,220 --> 02:11:51,500
the one who's got like five percent

1627
02:11:51,500 --> 02:11:53,500
and who needs more

1628
02:11:53,500 --> 02:11:58,620
yes ariana huffington i forgot her name she she needs she needs

1629
02:11:58,620 --> 02:12:01,300

1630
02:12:01,300 --> 02:12:03,900

02:12:05,740 --> 02:12:08,380

1633
02:12:08,380 --> 02:12:09,980
and you suck

1634
02:12:09,980 --> 02:12:14,640
i think i think i think i think we're going to have to be down

1635
02:12:14,640 --> 02:12:17,620
she actually needs more votes

1636
02:12:17,620 --> 02:12:21,080
for not getting up close

1637
02:12:21,080 --> 02:12:25,380
and i'll tell you i'm telling her body like the other candidate

1638
02:12:25,380 --> 02:12:28,620

02:12:28,620 --> 02:12:29,580

anyway i'd also a f you to tom mcclintock for uh... being an ass

1641
02:12:34,820 --> 02:12:36,900
and uh...

1642
02:12:36,900 --> 02:12:42,120
on a side note i'd like to say f you to nomo ono and uh...

1643
02:12:42,120 --> 02:12:46,520
and uh... silent profit for twisting my fragile little mind

1644
02:12:46,520 --> 02:12:48,320
and uh...

1645
02:12:48,320 --> 02:12:51,960
all i have left to say is mazel tov

1646
02:12:51,960 --> 02:12:53,320
my turn to rant

1647
02:12:53,320 --> 02:12:55,280
uh...

1648
02:12:55,280 --> 02:12:57,560
okay uh...

1649
02:12:57,560 --> 02:12:59,680
how come there's no music

1650
02:12:59,680 --> 02:13:00,700
i can't hear it

1651
02:13:00,700 --> 02:13:04,580
well then you should turn up your hearing aid

1652
02:13:04,580 --> 02:13:06,820
WHAT?! SONNY?!

1653
02:13:06,820 --> 02:13:10,020
Okay, um...

1654
02:13:10,020 --> 02:13:14,100
For one, fuck traffic.

1655
02:13:14,100 --> 02:13:18,340
Cause I hate traffic, and it's a pain in the ass, especially on every freeway.

1656
02:13:18,340 --> 02:13:21,580
And all the people who were on the road today.

1657
02:13:21,580 --> 02:13:26,260
Yes, that dumb bitch that wouldn't get out of my fucking lane.

1658
02:13:26,260 --> 02:13:28,460
That woman, oh my god, that woman was stupid.

1659
02:13:28,460 --> 02:13:33,940
And did you see the big dent in the back of her van? Yeah, it was probably from somebody she cut off like that.

1660
02:13:33,940 --> 02:13:35,940
She deserved it, bitch.

1661
02:13:35,940 --> 02:13:39,940
She looks like Sloth from The Goonies.

1662
02:13:39,940 --> 02:13:42,940
I didn't get to see her, but I got to see you flip her off.

1663
02:13:42,940 --> 02:13:49,940
You were a sick bastard.

1664
02:13:49,940 --> 02:13:55,940
Fuck Disneyland for ruining Big Thunder Mountain Railroad by having somebody die on it.

1665
02:13:55,940 --> 02:14:02,940
Because I love that ride, and now it's a death trap.

1666
02:14:02,940 --> 02:14:07,940
I'm waiting for a bunch of people to dial and you know Mr. Toad's wild ride

1667
02:14:07,940 --> 02:14:11,940
Can we get thrown out of a car and land on the ground and get run over by a car on a track?

1668
02:14:11,940 --> 02:14:14,940
One of the animatronics runs over him

1669
02:14:14,940 --> 02:14:18,940
Or I bet he has someone to fall off of the balcony in the ghost house

1670
02:14:18,940 --> 02:14:20,940
In the haunted mansion

1671
02:14:20,940 --> 02:14:23,940
That'd be great

1672
02:14:23,940 --> 02:14:29,940
Then that supposed rising elevator will actually collapse

1673
02:14:29,940 --> 02:14:34,940
And then, uh, fuck skin allergies, because they suck.

1674
02:14:34,940 --> 02:14:40,940
And fuck every kind of medicine that I've been prescribed to fix it and has it worked.

1675
02:14:40,940 --> 02:14:45,940
Or made it worse, because it sucks.

1676
02:14:45,940 --> 02:14:53,940
And, uh, fuck not being able to figure out anything that I wanted to rant about when I actually get here.

1677
02:14:53,940 --> 02:14:54,940
Because I, this morning...

1678
02:14:54,940 --> 02:14:56,940
Have you got it all out in the car?

1679
02:14:56,940 --> 02:15:07,940
I might have, yes, but I always think of stuff like on the way, like before I come, even leave to come here, and now I'm like, okay, you can have the microphone when I'm done looking.

1680
02:15:07,940 --> 02:15:10,940
Okay, do you have a microphone now? But I'm not done yet.

1681
02:15:10,940 --> 02:15:13,940
Okay, uh, let's see.

1682
02:15:13,940 --> 02:15:19,940
Fuck the DDR machine at Tactical Express in Davis because it's shit now.

1683
02:15:19,940 --> 02:15:23,940
I mean, it was kinda, it was crap before, but it's shit now.

1684
02:15:23,940 --> 02:15:36,940
Fuck Fuzzy's Health Drinks, because those gave me really bad diarrhea the past few days.

1685
02:15:36,940 --> 02:15:42,940
They taste good, but it doesn't come out the other end very well.

1686
02:15:42,940 --> 02:15:45,940
Thank you for that information that we didn't need to know.

1687
02:15:45,940 --> 02:15:53,220
No, you need to know that, because it can save you from a diarrhea trip.

1688
02:15:53,220 --> 02:15:54,780
Who drinks anything like that?

1689
02:15:54,780 --> 02:15:55,780
Really?

1690
02:15:55,780 --> 02:15:59,780
It looks like they have diarrhea going in.

1691
02:15:59,780 --> 02:16:03,700
But it's fruity, and it's colorful, and it's healthy.

1692
02:16:03,700 --> 02:16:04,700
Diarrhea?

1693
02:16:04,700 --> 02:16:06,700
Please pass the microphone.

1694
02:16:06,700 --> 02:16:07,700
No!

1695
02:16:07,700 --> 02:16:12,580
I don't feel like passing the microphone yet.

1696
02:16:12,580 --> 02:16:19,220
I got one more real quick and it's quiet quiet quiet time quiet time okay f you to the neighbor

1697
02:16:19,220 --> 02:16:27,860
upstairs because she's a racist she she she claims okay now get this cake this is her

1698
02:16:27,860 --> 02:16:33,060
reasoning she told she warned me and my girlfriend about the evil mexicans around here that go

1699
02:16:33,060 --> 02:16:39,780
and steal tools and she says i can i quote yeah i was watching my allergies and i saw

1700
02:16:39,780 --> 02:16:42,440
The Mexicans, and they were looking at your tools.

1701
02:16:42,440 --> 02:16:46,140
How can you physically watch allergies?

1702
02:16:46,140 --> 02:16:51,780
There goes an allergy! Oh, I better stay away from that one.

1703
02:16:51,780 --> 02:16:57,640
So, she sees an evil racist. I told you she was crazy. I knew it. I knew it all.

1704
02:16:57,640 --> 02:17:02,420
She gets racist. What's that with that sign over there, that cord that says Negro Bar?

1705
02:17:02,420 --> 02:17:08,100
Mexicans stole my stereo. That's really the name of the bar. I hate to break it to you, but it really is called that.

1706
02:17:08,100 --> 02:17:13,840
it's because it's spanish for black bar

1707
02:17:13,840 --> 02:17:15,060
anyway

1708
02:17:15,060 --> 02:17:17,760
bradley

1709
02:17:17,760 --> 02:17:19,160
bradley's turn

1710
02:17:19,160 --> 02:17:22,960
alright uh... fuck you to running out of money cause I'm almost out now

1711
02:17:22,960 --> 02:17:24,920
and fuck you to the

1712
02:17:24,920 --> 02:17:26,480
crappy economy

1713
02:17:26,480 --> 02:17:29,800
me for taking so long to get to the crappy economy to find a

1714
02:17:29,800 --> 02:17:32,640
maybe a crappy job I have to go

1715
02:17:32,640 --> 02:17:33,880
just to stay out here

1716
02:17:33,880 --> 02:17:36,880
Well, I've been talking to him about it later.

1717
02:17:36,880 --> 02:17:38,880
It's something good.

1718
02:17:38,880 --> 02:17:42,880
It doesn't require too much talking to people, because I'll suck at that.

1719
02:17:42,880 --> 02:17:46,880
Yeah, that's good.

1720
02:17:46,880 --> 02:17:49,880
See, that's why I couldn't get Bradley a job at Health Net, because I...

1721
02:17:49,880 --> 02:17:53,880
Oh, shit, I just gave that away where I work, but...

1722
02:17:53,880 --> 02:17:56,880
He is over there. He was at Death Net.

1723
02:17:56,880 --> 02:17:59,880
He's at Death Net.

1724
02:17:59,880 --> 02:18:02,880
cuz most of the people there take calls, so, you know.

1725
02:18:02,880 --> 02:18:06,880
I don't ever hear you talk.

1726
02:18:06,880 --> 02:18:09,880
Yeah.

1727
02:18:09,880 --> 02:18:14,880
Okay, uh, let's see.

1728
02:18:14,880 --> 02:18:19,880
Fuck you to having my hair being too long, it's getting annoying.

1729
02:18:19,880 --> 02:18:21,880
Time to cut it.

1730
02:18:21,880 --> 02:18:23,880
Low money, I can't really go to the barber.

1731
02:18:23,880 --> 02:18:26,880
I've cut my hair like twice.

1732
02:18:26,880 --> 02:18:28,880
I've cut my hair like the last two times.

1733
02:18:29,880 --> 02:18:32,880
I wonder if anyone noticed because it probably looked crappy.

1734
02:18:33,880 --> 02:18:36,880
Well, it's grown out now.

1735
02:18:38,880 --> 02:18:43,880
And fuck you to perfume inserts and cologne inserts. I hate smelling that shit all the time.

1736
02:18:44,880 --> 02:18:48,880
It comes in the mail. It smells up the mailbox. It smells up everything.

1737
02:18:48,880 --> 02:18:50,880
It smells up your mail.

1738
02:18:50,880 --> 02:18:57,120
Fuck you to people who wear too much cologne and perfume.

1739
02:18:57,120 --> 02:19:00,120
You stunk before you put it on, and then you stunk after.

1740
02:19:00,120 --> 02:19:01,120
Even worse.

1741
02:19:01,120 --> 02:19:02,120
Yeah.

1742
02:19:02,120 --> 02:19:03,120
And...

1743
02:19:03,120 --> 02:19:04,120
I don't know.

1744
02:19:04,120 --> 02:19:18,880
In the general, fuck you to every other crappy thing in the world.

1745
02:19:18,880 --> 02:19:25,880
the

1746
02:19:26,060 --> 02:19:29,060

1751
02:19:37,960 --> 02:19:40,760

happy birthday bread

1755
02:19:49,080 --> 02:19:56,080
almost a lot of cold winter nights a lot of birthdays in september i noticed

1756
02:19:56,160 --> 02:19:59,560
did anyone notice that i had one?

1757
02:19:59,560 --> 02:20:01,040
i won't tell

1758
02:20:01,040 --> 02:20:03,920
see you keep it a secret how do you show this to no one in the news?

1759
02:20:03,920 --> 02:20:10,040
there's actually an entry in my live journal that will tell you which day it was because it's a clue

1760
02:20:10,040 --> 02:20:13,880
there's an entry there and then

1761
02:20:13,880 --> 02:20:15,880
Well, happy birthday whenever it is.

1762
02:20:15,880 --> 02:20:18,880
It was early in the month, very early.

1763
02:20:18,880 --> 02:20:21,880
It's when I went to the DMV, so you can figure it out from there.

1764
02:20:21,880 --> 02:20:22,880
I gotcha.

1765
02:20:22,880 --> 02:20:25,880
I had to renew my license that day.

1766
02:20:25,880 --> 02:20:28,880
And that was fun waiting three hours.

1767
02:20:28,880 --> 02:20:36,880
At least they didn't charge me for not updating my dress for two years.

1768
02:20:36,880 --> 02:20:42,880
Because I feel like updating your dress is a $100 fine.

1769
02:20:42,880 --> 02:20:44,880
That's fine, that's good.

1770
02:21:12,880 --> 02:21:16,880
Dragon Rock Online. There's got to be a faster way to level up my acolyte, dammit.

1771
02:21:16,880 --> 02:21:18,880
Early for your...oh, never mind. That was a private interview.

1772
02:21:18,880 --> 02:21:22,880
Jamie says she will take you to level up.

1773
02:21:22,880 --> 02:21:27,880
DarkTetsuya says, F you to the stupid hit driving the pickup truck full of crap on the way to my girlfriend's.

1774
02:21:27,880 --> 02:21:32,880
He must have been doing 20 miles an hour.

1775
02:21:32,880 --> 02:21:36,880
Pixie Dust says, F you to work cutting my hours down to 26.

1776
02:21:36,880 --> 02:21:39,880
F you to this ugly, bitchy girl that I want to smack so bad.

1777
02:22:39,880 --> 02:22:40,880
computer monitor.

1778
02:22:40,880 --> 02:22:52,080
Dolemek says, F you to not having two days off in a row, F you to not winning Mega Butts,

1779
02:22:52,080 --> 02:22:54,800
which I'm guessing is a lottery in his state.

1780
02:22:54,800 --> 02:23:02,200
Vidpawa says, F you to nothing in particular and everything in general.

1781
02:23:02,200 --> 02:23:07,120
Too vague.

1782
02:23:07,120 --> 02:23:09,600
Everybody in mind knows Stylin says,

1783
02:23:09,600 --> 02:23:12,800
I'm my F-you for not having a job and my car being dead.

1784
02:23:14,060 --> 02:23:14,900
Sucks.

1785
02:23:17,140 --> 02:23:18,300
All right, that's it.

1786
02:23:18,300 --> 02:23:20,180
That's all for the F-yous of the week.

1787
02:23:20,180 --> 02:23:22,760
Finally, we're gonna do a quick break.

1788
02:23:22,760 --> 02:23:23,820
We're gonna set up for match game

1789
02:23:23,820 --> 02:23:25,300
and then we're gonna come back and do the match game.

1790
02:23:25,300 --> 02:23:27,140
In the meantime, I'm gonna ask a question

1791
02:23:27,140 --> 02:23:28,700
and the first two people to message me

1792
02:23:28,700 --> 02:23:31,060
the answer to this question will get to play match game.

1793
02:23:31,060 --> 02:23:33,100
It's a memory retention question.

1794
02:23:33,100 --> 02:23:35,460
How well have you been listening to this show?

1795
02:23:36,460 --> 02:23:37,460
Here we go.

1796
02:23:40,460 --> 02:23:43,460
Not last week. Not last week. I'm going to ask question of this week.

1797
02:23:43,460 --> 02:23:45,460
I didn't mean to put it on the microphone.

1798
02:23:45,460 --> 02:23:48,460
It's an easy question. If you guys don't get it, you're retarded.

1799
02:23:48,460 --> 02:23:49,460
Okay, here we go.

1800
02:23:50,460 --> 02:23:54,460
What golf land does puppy work at over the summer?

1801
02:23:54,460 --> 02:23:55,460
That's the question.

1802
02:23:55,460 --> 02:23:58,460
First two people to private message me the answer get to play match game.

1803
02:23:58,460 --> 02:24:02,560
match game

1804
02:24:02,560 --> 02:24:06,140
and i realize all you're a different differing buffers and it's probably not

1805
02:24:06,140 --> 02:24:09,020
fair for me to ask a question over the radio but you know what kids

1806
02:24:09,020 --> 02:24:12,100
life's not fair

1807
02:24:12,100 --> 02:24:14,580
so i feel that

1808
02:24:14,580 --> 02:24:16,360
in the meantime a break

1809
02:24:16,360 --> 02:24:20,780
with uh... a keyboard mania song i want to hear will be back

1810
02:24:20,780 --> 02:24:27,780
with matching

1811
02:25:50,780 --> 02:26:12,780

1813
02:26:17,780 --> 02:26:19,780

02:26:19,780 --> 02:26:21,780
Feel this, feel these

1815
02:26:21,780 --> 02:26:23,780
Uh, uh

1816
02:26:23,780 --> 02:26:25,780
Think of this world without sound

1817
02:26:25,780 --> 02:26:27,780
Can't even feel a heart pound

1818
02:26:27,780 --> 02:26:29,780
Wasting time, wasting life, wasting self

1819
02:26:29,780 --> 02:26:31,780

02:29:29,660 --> 02:29:35,260
to dance to than that freaking catch-up song, Orange Lounge Radio.

1876
02:29:35,260 --> 02:29:38,180
Welcome back, boys and girls, to Orange Lounge Radio. We're going to play the match game

1877
02:29:38,180 --> 02:29:42,540
now. Let me explain how the match game works. Basically, we're going to ask a question,

1878
02:29:42,540 --> 02:29:45,100
and then there's a blank somewhere in that question. We're not really asking a question.

1879
02:29:45,100 --> 02:29:47,780
We're saying a sentence. We're telling a story, and there's a blank in there somewhere.

1880
02:29:47,780 --> 02:29:51,820
You get to fill it in. The contestants will have to fill it in, and

1881
02:29:51,820 --> 02:29:58,080
for every celebrity they match, they get a point. So, a lot of you meanies in the chat

1882
02:29:58,080 --> 02:30:01,600
room got a lot of people got the answer to the trivia question correct puppy

1883
02:30:01,600 --> 02:30:05,680
worked at Castor Valley Golf Land over the summer and man when I told you you

1884
02:30:05,680 --> 02:30:10,920

1885
02:30:10,920 --> 02:30:15,840

1886
02:30:15,840 --> 02:30:21,960
people yes yeah I have something else to dedicate a nice big laugh for me to you

1887
02:30:21,960 --> 02:30:26,760
with love all right but I'm actually glad because we have two contestants who

1888
02:30:26,760 --> 02:30:30,520
we have never had a plane match game before. So this should be interesting. Contestant

1889
02:30:30,520 --> 02:30:38,680
number one, the first person to submit correctly was DJ Tyrant. Yes, a SoCal man. Contestant

1890
02:30:38,680 --> 02:30:43,200
number two, and this should be interesting, this is going to be very interesting, no stylin',

1891
02:30:43,200 --> 02:30:49,520
this is contestant number two. So contestants, you're going to send your answers. When I

1892
02:30:49,520 --> 02:30:53,760
ask the question, you send your answers to me over private message in the chat room.

1893
02:31:23,760 --> 02:31:28,760
But she was still the third person anyway. She would have had a ride if she said CVGL.

1894
02:31:28,760 --> 02:31:30,760
But, anyway.

1895
02:31:30,760 --> 02:31:35,760
Well, you know what? But she gets to listen and know that she inspired this wonderful segment tonight.

1896
02:31:35,760 --> 02:31:39,760
Maybe we should have an honorable third party.

1897
02:31:39,760 --> 02:31:41,760
Maybe we're running out of time.

1898
02:31:41,760 --> 02:31:43,760
Okay.

1899
02:31:43,760 --> 02:31:45,760
Here we go.

1900
02:31:45,760 --> 02:31:47,760
As much as I love Mern.

1901
02:31:47,760 --> 02:31:51,760
Alright, here we go. Question number one.

1902
02:31:51,760 --> 02:31:54,560
One day Betty the Bamani addict

1903
02:31:55,980 --> 02:31:57,980
Joey those are the music games

1904
02:31:59,980 --> 02:32:02,540
Everybody by the way is playing tonight. Everybody is a celebrity here tonight

1905
02:32:03,300 --> 02:32:06,960
Betty the Bamani addict decided she was tired of playing Beatmania

1906
02:32:07,580 --> 02:32:10,980
Instead she decided to try the new Bamani game blank

1907
02:32:11,900 --> 02:32:15,820
Jamie wrote all of tonight's questions, by the way, so if you don't like a question blame me

1908
02:32:15,820 --> 02:32:22,140
Betty, the Bomani addict, decided she was tired of playing Beatmania.

1909
02:32:22,140 --> 02:32:38,620
Instead, she decided to try the new Bomani game, Blank.

1910
02:32:38,620 --> 02:32:41,780
The contestants are thinking.

1911
02:32:41,780 --> 02:32:47,780
I have one contestant locked in with their answer, and I think that's both contestants.

1912
02:32:47,780 --> 02:32:51,780
Let me just verify they did submit answers and not questions like, huh?

1913
02:32:51,780 --> 02:32:52,780
Yeah, there's one.

1914
02:32:52,780 --> 02:32:53,780
I got a huh.

1915
02:32:53,780 --> 02:32:56,780
Give me a sec.

1916
02:32:56,780 --> 02:33:01,780
I need another pen.

1917
02:33:01,780 --> 02:33:02,780
Okay.

1918
02:33:02,780 --> 02:33:06,780
Okay, I have both answers.

1919
02:33:06,780 --> 02:33:10,780
Are all the celebrities ready?

1920
02:33:10,780 --> 02:33:18,580
Okay, here we go. Alright, let's see what you guys put. You want to do the contestants

1921
02:33:18,580 --> 02:33:31,300
first, or let's do the contestants first? What do you mean just in case?

1922
02:33:31,300 --> 02:33:37,920
I don't care. I don't care. Tyrant says, instead she decided to try the

1923
02:33:37,920 --> 02:33:44,920
the new Bimani game, Marshall Beat. That's not a new Bimani game but that's what he said,

1924
02:33:44,920 --> 02:33:53,920
so there it is. Maybe it's new at the arcade, I don't know. NoStylin says, NoStylin says

1925
02:33:53,920 --> 02:34:00,920
Betty decided to try the Noobamani game. DDR beat their meat.

1926
02:34:00,920 --> 02:34:11,760
Okay, let's see. Loki, your answer was? He decided to try the Noobamani game. Marshall

1927
02:34:11,760 --> 02:34:18,760
beat off. Oh, so close! Do you think that's a, do you think that's a, you know what, cause

1928
02:34:18,960 --> 02:34:25,320
Tyrant put Marshall beat in all caps. Beat is in caps, so the emphasis was on the beat.

1929
02:34:25,320 --> 02:34:29,320
We want to give them both a point? Give them both a point. Okay, so they both get a point

1930
02:34:29,320 --> 02:34:32,920
for that, cause they're both kind of close. Okay. A point for Tyrant and a point for No

1931
02:34:32,920 --> 02:34:39,800
Sound. This is amazing! Most number of points scored in the game ever. My answer, my answer

1932
02:34:39,800 --> 02:34:47,720
was they decided to play SARS mania. Not a match, sorry. Now Joey, this should be fun

1933
02:34:47,720 --> 02:34:53,960
because Joey got to see DDR, well Joey actually got introduced to the whole DDR obsession

1934
02:34:53,960 --> 02:34:58,320
of ours this weekend, so he's still kind of catching up on all the inside jokes, so this

1935
02:34:58,320 --> 02:35:07,160
should be great. Yeah, well the answer that I picked was beat me down. Beat me down! That's

1936
02:35:07,160 --> 02:35:08,160
It's good.

1937
02:35:08,160 --> 02:35:09,160
It's like punch mania, kind of.

1938
02:35:09,160 --> 02:35:10,160
But not a match.

1939
02:35:10,160 --> 02:35:13,840
So it sucks to be a contestant.

1940
02:35:13,840 --> 02:35:17,840
Mine was monkey mania pooflinging edition.

1941
02:35:17,840 --> 02:35:21,720
Monkey mania pooflinging edition, no I'm sorry that is not a match.

1942
02:35:21,720 --> 02:35:22,720
Puppy.

1943
02:35:22,720 --> 02:35:26,880
I said spoon freaks.

1944
02:35:26,880 --> 02:35:30,240
Spoon freaks is not a match.

1945
02:35:30,240 --> 02:35:32,960
I said forehead smacking mania.

1946
02:35:32,960 --> 02:35:36,160
Forehead smacking mania, fun but no.

1947
02:35:36,160 --> 02:35:44,520
night I'd kick a baby mania baby mania wonderful however not a match so after

1948
02:35:44,520 --> 02:35:48,440

1963
02:37:13,880 --> 02:37:27,560
but F0GX 2. Tyron had a new store that sold nothing

1964
02:37:27,560 --> 02:37:34,440
but F0GX. Okay. This isn't Rob, it was Sally, but close. Okay. We'll see though. We'll see.

1965
02:37:34,440 --> 02:37:38,320
You never know. Flickin Nick Dickey. I don't know. I was thinking about that one.

1966
02:37:38,320 --> 02:37:42,920
Somehow I don't think it's going to match. I don't know if it's going to match, but I

1967
02:37:42,920 --> 02:37:52,960
said Cuban immigrants. A store that sold nothing but Cuban immigrants. No, not a match, unfortunately.

1968
02:37:52,960 --> 02:37:57,960
I put, Sally the Shopaholic was so excited, there was a store that sold nothing but babies!

1969
02:37:57,960 --> 02:38:00,960
Babies, not a match, sorry.

1970
02:38:00,960 --> 02:38:01,960
Joey.

1971
02:38:01,960 --> 02:38:02,960
Panties?

1972
02:38:02,960 --> 02:38:03,960
Panties?

1973
02:38:03,960 --> 02:38:04,960
Panties?

1974
02:38:04,960 --> 02:38:12,000
Panties, although I think Flick-a-nick-dicky might be a term for panties, I'm not sure

1975
02:38:12,000 --> 02:38:13,880
and I can't look it up so you lose.

1976
02:38:13,880 --> 02:38:14,880
Good point.

1977
02:38:14,880 --> 02:38:15,880
No points.

1978
02:38:15,880 --> 02:38:16,880
Alright, going on.

1979
02:38:16,880 --> 02:38:17,880
Puppy.

1980
02:38:17,880 --> 02:38:18,880
Oh, I'm sorry, Jamie.

1981
02:38:18,880 --> 02:38:19,880
Propel!

1982
02:38:19,880 --> 02:38:20,880
Propel!

1983
02:38:20,880 --> 02:38:21,880
There you go!

1984
02:38:21,880 --> 02:38:25,880
You know, I usually expect people to pick Propel when I'm playing.

1985
02:38:25,880 --> 02:38:26,880
Yeah, well.

1986
02:38:26,880 --> 02:38:27,880
And no, stupid.

1987
02:38:27,880 --> 02:38:30,880
We have new contestants tonight, give them a break.

1988
02:38:30,880 --> 02:38:31,880
Puppy.

1989
02:38:31,880 --> 02:38:34,880
I say, defective condoms.

1990
02:38:34,880 --> 02:38:35,880
Defective condoms.

1991
02:38:35,880 --> 02:38:36,880
Oh, nice.

1992
02:38:36,880 --> 02:38:41,880
I don't know how a store would stay open, so I'm not, but okay.

1993
02:38:41,880 --> 02:38:42,880
Bubby.

1994
02:38:42,880 --> 02:38:44,880
My answer is, detached eyeballs.

1995
02:38:44,880 --> 02:38:47,880
Detached eyeballs, lovely, no.

1996
02:38:47,880 --> 02:38:48,880
A punk night.

1997
02:38:48,880 --> 02:39:03,320
Alright, my answer was down syndrome porn. Down syndrome porn, oh. Wow. Wow, I'm so glad

1998
02:39:03,320 --> 02:39:09,840
we let him go last. Alright, so after two rounds it's still tied up but one apiece.

1999
02:39:09,840 --> 02:39:17,040
And those are pity points by the way. Here we go, next question. Yay. Alright, shut

2000
02:39:17,040 --> 02:39:24,500
up here we go. Miyako was so depressed. She had been drugged and pulled into an

2001
02:39:24,500 --> 02:39:29,160
island with her classmates to do battle royale. And, the weapon she was given was

2002
02:39:29,160 --> 02:39:35,560
a blank. All right. She'd been drugged and pulled to the island with her classmates

2003
02:39:35,560 --> 02:39:54,880
to do battle royale and the weapon she was given was a blank we're just

2004
02:39:54,880 --> 02:39:57,400
waiting for the contestants to answer and waiting for all the celebrities

2005
02:39:57,400 --> 02:40:01,280
locking their vote Miyako was so depressed she got drugged pulled to the

2006
02:40:01,280 --> 02:40:04,340
island with her classmates to battle royale and the weapon she was given was

2007
02:40:04,340 --> 02:40:32,620
a blank? Alright, well we have music going. Mid Palace has a cassette tape of old Orange

2008
02:40:32,620 --> 02:40:42,520
lounge episodes. It's kind of close to what I put though. Okay, here we go. Alright, we

2009
02:40:42,520 --> 02:40:47,220
have the contestants logged in. Starting off with Tyrant. Miyako was so depressed she got

2010
02:40:47,220 --> 02:40:49,800
drugged and pulled to the island with her classmates to do battle royale. The weapon

2011
02:40:49,800 --> 02:40:55,520
she was given was a, Tyrant says, a trout. Like IRC, get it, a trout. Ha ha ha. Okay,

2012
02:40:55,520 --> 02:41:01,920
that was a cute answer, I like that. Alright. No Styler says the weapon she was given was

2013
02:41:01,920 --> 02:41:08,600
There's a magic kicky Dicky and the Nicky.

2014
02:41:08,600 --> 02:41:10,640
Oh Nicky please, not so quicky.

2015
02:41:10,640 --> 02:41:11,640
Okay.

2016
02:41:11,640 --> 02:41:12,640
Wow.

2017
02:41:12,640 --> 02:41:17,540
Loki, your answer please.

2018
02:41:17,540 --> 02:41:21,480
Three words, Iraqi suicide babies.

2019
02:41:21,480 --> 02:41:25,800
Awesome, anybody that used to listen to this show would get that joke.

2020
02:41:25,800 --> 02:41:31,320
I said the weapon she was given was a bad joke book offered by 23rd Magus.

2021
02:41:31,320 --> 02:41:38,320
a match, sorry. No, she'd win. She'd win. I just, I'm going to get killed. Joey, a multi-purpose

2022
02:41:43,340 --> 02:41:49,520
magic banana. A multi-purpose magic banana. She'd probably be too preoccupied with that

2023
02:41:49,520 --> 02:41:55,160
and get caught in a danger zone and her collar would explode. Mine was a yoko on a CD and

2024
02:41:55,160 --> 02:42:00,200
a CD player. Oh, very nice. There's a lot of this theme of like hearing things. Well,

2025
02:42:00,200 --> 02:42:05,200
0blivixx,0blivixx,0blivixx,0blivixx.

2026
02:42:30,200 --> 02:42:43,200
A monkey launcher. A monkey launcher, lovely. Alright. Okay, so not a match for either contestant, sorry.

2027
02:42:45,200 --> 02:42:56,200
No, in the book, in the book they have different weapons than in the movie and someone got a sticky dart gun. No, got a dart board and darts as their weapon.

2028
02:42:56,200 --> 02:43:00,800
all right moving on here we go still want a piece

2029
02:43:00,800 --> 02:43:05,800
Francine the fanfic writer was getting impatient for the next Harry Potter book

2030
02:43:05,800 --> 02:43:08,840
so she decided to write it herself

2031
02:43:08,840 --> 02:43:13,440
but she couldn't think of a good name finally she decided to name it

2032
02:43:13,440 --> 02:43:29,260
Harry Potter and the Blank. Francine, the fanfic writer, was getting impatient for the

2033
02:43:29,260 --> 02:43:32,700
next Harry Potter book, so she decided to write it herself, but she couldn't think of

2034
02:43:32,700 --> 02:43:53,420
a good name. Finally, she decided to name it Harry Potter and the blank.

2035
02:43:53,420 --> 02:44:15,480
She decided to name it Harry Potter in the blank.

2036
02:44:15,480 --> 02:44:18,200
I'm just waiting for both contestants to lock in with an answer here.

2037
02:44:18,200 --> 02:44:22,800
Finally, she decided to name it Harry Potter in the blank.

2038
02:44:22,800 --> 02:44:23,800
I need an answer, too.

2039
02:44:23,800 --> 02:44:24,800
All right.

2040
02:44:24,800 --> 02:44:25,800
Okay.

2041
02:44:25,800 --> 02:44:26,800
Here we go.

2042
02:44:26,800 --> 02:44:27,800
Ready?

2043
02:44:27,800 --> 02:44:28,800
Are we all ready?

2044
02:44:28,800 --> 02:44:29,800
Yes.

2045
02:44:29,800 --> 02:44:30,800
Ding, ding.

2046
02:44:30,800 --> 02:44:31,800
Everybody's named.

2047
02:44:31,800 --> 02:44:32,800
All right.

2048
02:44:32,800 --> 02:44:33,800
No silence says.

2049
02:44:33,800 --> 02:44:44,800
She decided to call it Harry Potter gone wild with a bomb and a cannon.

2050
02:44:44,800 --> 02:44:53,600
Harry Potter gone wild with a bomb in a can of some sort

2051
02:44:53,600 --> 02:44:59,680
DJ Tyrant Harry Potter and the breast implant

2052
02:44:59,680 --> 02:45:10,400
Loki. Let's see if we get a match. Damn, I have like two. Well, since they're both not

2053
02:45:10,400 --> 02:45:17,720
matching anyways, Harry Potter and the Horny Catholic Priest, or Harry Potter and the Sex

2054
02:45:17,720 --> 02:45:20,920
Change. But I like Horny Catholic Priest better.

2055
02:45:20,920 --> 02:45:21,920
Would he be Harriet Potter?

2056
02:45:21,920 --> 02:45:25,560
The Horny Catholic Priest would be kind of close. That would be like a half point. But

2057
02:45:25,560 --> 02:45:27,360
Horny Catholic Priest was your first pick.

2058
02:45:27,360 --> 02:45:29,040
Would he be Harriet Potter?

2059
02:45:29,040 --> 02:45:33,800
I was kind of stretched for an answer, so I used a good classic inside joke.

2060
02:45:33,800 --> 02:45:37,760
I said Harry Potter and the Stars Infested Monkeys.

2061
02:45:37,760 --> 02:45:40,960
Joey.

2062
02:45:40,960 --> 02:45:43,600
Harry Potter and the Search for Sexual Release.

2063
02:45:43,600 --> 02:45:44,600
Nice.

2064
02:45:44,600 --> 02:45:45,600
Whale.

2065
02:45:45,600 --> 02:45:46,600
Jamie.

2066
02:45:46,600 --> 02:45:51,120
I said, and people who actually are fans of the book would get it, and it also fits in

2067
02:45:51,120 --> 02:45:55,160
with the show, Harry Potter and the Magical Bouncing Ferret.

2068
02:45:55,160 --> 02:46:13,520
Harry Potter and the Swedish Furniture Good answer, but not a match.

2069
02:46:13,520 --> 02:46:20,240
Harry Potter and the plus filled Acne of Doom Appropriate, but not a match.

2070
02:46:20,240 --> 02:46:29,860
night. Harry Potter and the pile of dead babies. Not a match, I'm so sorry. Alright, here

2071
02:46:29,860 --> 02:46:33,680
we go, two more questions to go. Will they break the tie of one to one? Probably not,

2072
02:46:33,680 --> 02:46:42,200
but let's keep playing anyway. Here we go. Perry the painter was working on his new masterpiece

2073
02:46:42,200 --> 02:46:48,360
and ran out of a few of his paints. He was almost done, so to replace the missing paints

2074
02:46:48,360 --> 02:46:55,280
he used blank. Perry the painter was working on his new masterpiece and he ran out of a

2075
02:46:55,280 --> 02:47:17,280
few of his paints. He was almost done, so to replace the missing paints he used blank.

2076
02:47:17,280 --> 02:47:22,320
The contestants are thinking about their answers.

2077
02:47:22,320 --> 02:47:27,120
The celebrities are thinking about their answers.

2078
02:47:27,120 --> 02:47:28,880
Here's the question one more time.

2079
02:47:28,880 --> 02:47:34,260
Perry the painter was working on his new masterpiece and ran out of a few of his paints.

2080
02:47:34,260 --> 02:47:40,720
He was almost done, so to replace the missing paints he used blank.

2081
02:47:40,720 --> 02:47:42,280
I'm waiting on both contestants.

2082
02:47:42,280 --> 02:47:45,280
Oh, looks like we might have one.

2083
02:47:45,280 --> 02:48:10,040
p0k3smot42o

2084
02:48:10,040 --> 02:48:16,720
Tyrant said, Perry the painter was working on his new masterpiece and ran out of a few

2085
02:48:16,720 --> 02:48:17,720
of his paints.

2086
02:48:17,720 --> 02:48:26,480
He was almost done, so to replace the missing paints he used pus from zits.

2087
02:48:26,480 --> 02:48:27,480
No stylin says.

2088
02:48:27,480 --> 02:48:32,560
To replace the paints he used the jizz and then afterwards decided to fap to some Orange

2089
02:48:32,560 --> 02:48:33,560
Lounge Radio.

2090
02:48:33,560 --> 02:48:34,560
Aw, how lovely.

2091
02:48:34,560 --> 02:48:37,560
Way to show your love.

2092
02:48:37,560 --> 02:48:39,560
Alright, uh, Loki.

2093
02:48:41,560 --> 02:48:44,560
Um, he used clubbed baby seals.

2094
02:48:48,560 --> 02:48:49,560
Nice, but not a match.

2095
02:48:50,560 --> 02:48:53,560
Uh, I said he ran out of paint, so he decided to use skin.

2096
02:48:54,560 --> 02:48:55,560
Not a match.

2097
02:48:56,560 --> 02:48:57,560
I'm just being morbid.

2098
02:48:59,560 --> 02:49:02,560
You know, I was gonna use jizz myself, but then I decided to just use blood.

2099
02:49:04,560 --> 02:49:05,560
So simple, not a match.

2100
02:49:05,560 --> 02:49:06,560
Jamie.

2101
02:49:06,560 --> 02:49:25,560
The brains of golf lads children used the dog rotting on his doorstep.

2102
02:49:25,560 --> 02:49:31,560
A bulimic person's vomit.

2103
02:49:31,560 --> 02:49:40,560
A bulimic person's vomit. Colorful, not a match. Wow.

2104
02:49:40,560 --> 02:49:52,160
Alright, here we go, last question. This is your last chance to get a point, otherwise

2105
02:49:52,160 --> 02:49:55,520
we're going to have a tie and nobody likes a tie.

2106
02:49:55,520 --> 02:49:58,500
Alright, here's a question.

2107
02:49:58,500 --> 02:50:03,200
Kelly was tired of staying at home all day

2108
02:50:03,200 --> 02:50:08,900
so she decided that she would leave. She hopped in her car and decided that she was

2109
02:50:08,900 --> 02:50:10,920
gonna go on a road trip to blank.

2110
02:50:10,920 --> 02:50:15,240

02:50:19,740 --> 02:50:20,860
She hopped in her car

02:50:20,860 --> 02:50:27,860
and decided that she was going to go on a road trip to blank.

an answer all right beautiful we have an answer all right and let's let's hear

2125
02:52:29,400 --> 02:52:34,680
what no silence answer is Kelly hopped in the car and decided she was going on a

2126
02:52:34,680 --> 02:52:41,400
road trip to the famous SARS land that was provided by Baca being another one

2127
02:52:41,400 --> 02:52:45,000
our chat regulars trying to take a slam on bucket there lovely answer we'll see

2128
02:52:45,000 --> 02:52:50,280
if it's a match I DJ tyrant says she decided to take a road trip to Castro

2129
02:52:50,280 --> 02:53:01,320
Valley Golf Lands very nice let's see if we get a match Loki she took a trip to

2130
02:53:01,320 --> 02:53:07,520
the big Thunder Mountain to ride the big Thunder Mountain railroad I thought

2131
02:53:07,520 --> 02:53:15,120
I thought you were about to say the dark black forest, but I said she was going to take a

2132
02:53:15,120 --> 02:53:21,200
trip to the McFlicky Dick Nicky, and you know, I tried to toss you a bone and you didn't

2133
02:53:21,200 --> 02:53:23,560
take it, so you lose, sorry.

2134
02:53:23,560 --> 02:53:24,560
Julie?

2135
02:53:24,560 --> 02:53:30,240
I couldn't think of anything, but she took a trip to the old Penisville.

2136
02:53:30,240 --> 02:53:31,640
The Penisville!

2137
02:53:31,640 --> 02:53:33,240
How nice.

2138
02:53:33,240 --> 02:53:34,240
Jamie?

2139
02:53:34,240 --> 02:53:39,240
She took a trip to that hand basket going straight to hell to join the Orange Challenge crew on their way there.

2140
02:53:39,240 --> 02:53:44,240
Yay! We're going to hell!

2141
02:53:44,240 --> 02:53:46,240
Yay!

2142
02:53:46,240 --> 02:53:48,240
Puppy, your answer?

2143
02:53:48,240 --> 02:53:51,240
I said to ride the death traps at Disneyland.

2144
02:53:51,240 --> 02:53:55,240
The death traps at Disneyland? I see Disneyland would have got you two points right there.

2145
02:53:55,240 --> 02:53:56,240
Bradley?

2146
02:53:56,240 --> 02:53:59,240
She took a trip to her local whorehouse.

2147
02:53:59,240 --> 02:54:01,240
To her local whorehouse! Practical!

2148
02:54:01,240 --> 02:54:03,240
But not a match.

2149
02:54:03,240 --> 02:54:07,240
She took a trip to dig up grandpa.

2150
02:54:07,240 --> 02:54:13,240
She took a trip to dig up grandpa. Beautiful, but not a match.

2151
02:54:13,240 --> 02:54:17,240
Alright, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah.

2152
02:54:17,240 --> 02:54:25,240
So, the final score is DJ Tyrant. One point! No stylin'. One point!

2153
02:54:25,240 --> 02:54:28,240
So, who do we want to win? Who do we want to win?

2154
02:54:28,240 --> 02:54:30,240
Nobody. I win!

2155
02:54:30,240 --> 02:54:34,960
Yeah, that's right. You know what? When they tie, that means we win. So congratulations

2156
02:54:34,960 --> 02:54:41,000
Orange Lodge Radio. We'll beat the chat room because we're better. Just kidding. Just kidding.

2157
02:54:41,000 --> 02:54:46,800
Stay, stay. I forgot to mention for my birthday, well, this is probably something for the afterbirth,

2158
02:54:46,800 --> 02:54:52,320
but I got erotic magnets. Erotic poetry magnets. You can make...

2159
02:54:52,320 --> 02:54:55,480
Put them on the fridge. Because they're not on the fridge. Because

2160
02:54:55,480 --> 02:54:58,120
people need to be creative and put erotic phrases on the fridge.

2161
02:54:58,120 --> 02:55:01,320
I'm going to go do one right now!

2162
02:55:01,320 --> 02:55:10,880
Right, I have no time to take a break, so I need to wrap up what's the news I wanted to get to.

2163
02:55:10,880 --> 02:55:16,520
Bahmani News, here we go, last three minutes of the show, we have some Bahmani News.

2164
02:55:16,520 --> 02:55:20,880
More U.S. home version songs have been confirmed for Max 2, here they are.

2165
02:55:20,880 --> 02:55:23,240
Loki, you'll be surprised at some of these.

2166
02:55:23,240 --> 02:55:24,680
Feeling of Love.

2167
02:55:24,680 --> 02:55:27,520
Oh my God!

2168
02:55:27,520 --> 02:55:29,240
max unlimited

2169
02:55:29,240 --> 02:55:32,400
surprise more deep version 2.1

2170
02:55:32,400 --> 02:55:33,720
a good song

2171
02:55:33,720 --> 02:55:35,120
and xenon

2172
02:55:35,120 --> 02:55:39,000
in max 2

2173
02:55:39,000 --> 02:55:41,360
ddr ultramix

2174
02:55:41,360 --> 02:55:45,960
castles in the sky will be in ddr ultramix that's ian vandahl

2175
02:55:45,960 --> 02:55:49,600
colors by dj taka and sugaru

2176
02:55:49,600 --> 02:55:54,880
also in other news on uh... ddr freak right now they're having people suggest

2177
02:55:54,880 --> 02:55:57,120
uh... songs that you would like to see

2178
02:55:57,120 --> 02:56:01,680
in UltraMix is probably one of those packs you have to buy for songs, you know, and whatnot.

2179
02:56:02,240 --> 02:56:04,240
So, go there and do that.

2180
02:56:04,240 --> 02:56:11,180
Plus, DDR Max 2 is going to have an all-new updated system for the diet mode.

2181
02:56:11,180 --> 02:56:16,060
They're going to have, like, you know, workout courses you can do, like low impact, high impact,

2182
02:56:16,280 --> 02:56:20,080
I'm lazy, you know, that type of thing.

2183
02:56:20,960 --> 02:56:22,080
So, fun stuff like that.

2184
02:56:22,080 --> 02:56:24,940
And you're probably going to see max period at some point in there.

2185
02:56:24,940 --> 02:56:29,940
Kitten. That's a dumbass name for a freaking song I've ever seen.

2186
02:56:29,940 --> 02:56:34,940
You know what's interesting? I'm noticing more and more that Max 2 is basically a US

2187
02:56:34,940 --> 02:56:38,940
version of Xtreme. It really is. It's a US version of the Japanese Xtreme.

2188
02:56:38,940 --> 02:56:39,940
So that means it's going to suck?

2189
02:56:39,940 --> 02:56:43,940
No, I think it's actually going to be really good because we've already all played Xtreme.

2190
02:56:43,940 --> 02:56:49,940
You know what's interesting though? We played the demo. Loki and I played the demo for Max

2191
02:56:49,940 --> 02:56:53,940
2 USA. We have it. And we were playing D2R. The first thing I noticed is that D2R has

2192
02:56:53,940 --> 02:56:58,680
D2R has Xtreme's video. It doesn't have the D2R video for Max 2 because they're different.

2193
02:56:58,680 --> 02:57:04,040
If you think about it, yes they are. In Xtreme you had this, I recognize one of the videos,

2194
02:57:04,040 --> 02:57:07,380
it's like a matrix effect where you have the numbers changing while it's running down the

2195
02:57:07,380 --> 02:57:08,380
screen.

2196
02:57:08,380 --> 02:57:09,380
That wasn't Max 2.

2197
02:57:09,380 --> 02:57:15,320
No it wasn't, but it wasn't in the D2R video. I'm almost positive, I'm like 99% positive

2198
02:57:15,320 --> 02:57:19,360
that D2R has a new video in this. It has Xtreme's video, not Max 2's video.

2199
02:57:19,360 --> 02:57:21,800
Oh, it doesn't really matter, it's a background video.

2200
02:57:21,800 --> 02:57:25,720
Yeah, I know. Not that we really give a shit, but that makes me think that, oh, it's based

2201
02:57:25,720 --> 02:57:28,240
off Xtreme's engine, not Max 2.

2202
02:57:28,240 --> 02:57:29,800
Well, it didn't...

2203
02:57:29,800 --> 02:57:30,800
Whatever.

2204
02:57:30,800 --> 02:57:32,360
Well, I thought they said that, didn't they?

2205
02:57:32,360 --> 02:57:33,760
It's based off of Euromix 2.

2206
02:57:33,760 --> 02:57:34,760
Ew!

2207
02:57:34,760 --> 02:57:36,760
It's not an engine.

2208
02:57:36,760 --> 02:57:37,760
So there.

2209
02:57:37,760 --> 02:57:38,760
Euromix.

2210
02:57:38,760 --> 02:57:44,200
I had a point I wanted to make. Also in Xtreme, they've announced that most of the unlocks

2211
02:57:44,200 --> 02:57:47,800
from the arcade, I'm not gonna read the whole list, but pretty much anything that was unlocked

2212
02:57:47,800 --> 02:57:55,000
by a code in the arcade, songs such as Sink, Dance Dance Revolution, Paranoia Survivor,

2213
02:57:55,000 --> 02:57:56,520
etc. is a hidden track.

2214
02:57:56,520 --> 02:58:00,440
Your mama's on crack rock, you should be in DDR.

2215
02:58:00,440 --> 02:58:05,520
Pixie Dust is suggesting your mama's on crack rock should be in DDR Max 2.

2216
02:58:05,520 --> 02:58:07,000
You should go suggest that in the DDR.

2217
02:58:07,000 --> 02:58:10,520
That is the best suggestion ever to be in DDR.

2218
02:58:10,520 --> 02:58:14,480
Not my mama, my mama in rehab.

2219
02:58:14,480 --> 02:58:15,480
That song was the best.

2220
02:58:15,480 --> 02:58:21,080
I have, like, on a tape that I made when I was in middle school.

2221
02:58:21,080 --> 02:58:22,080
What a lovely thought.

2222
02:58:22,080 --> 02:58:24,400
I'm going to go download that tonight.

2223
02:58:24,400 --> 02:58:28,200
Okay, um, any other Bamani news anyone had to report?

2224
02:58:28,200 --> 02:58:31,960
I mean, we've got the game, the game is out in a week and a half, Max 2.

2225
02:58:31,960 --> 02:58:37,080
And, uh, Wednesday night, next, a week from Wednesday, we're going to do, um, what we

2226
02:58:37,080 --> 02:58:41,120
did for Max 1, we're going to play it, we're going to just bring home the copy and play

2227
02:58:41,120 --> 02:58:42,120
it on air.

2228
02:58:42,120 --> 02:58:43,120
Yay.

2229
02:58:43,120 --> 02:58:48,120
Although I believe it's actually being released on Tuesday, right?

2230
02:58:48,120 --> 02:58:49,120
The 24th.

2231
02:58:49,120 --> 02:58:50,120
The 24th is a Tuesday.

2232
02:58:50,120 --> 02:58:51,120
Wednesday.

2233
02:58:51,120 --> 02:58:52,120
Oh, it's Wednesday?

2234
02:58:52,120 --> 02:58:53,120
I don't know anymore.

2235
02:58:53,120 --> 02:58:55,120
I didn't know because I have to start classes on the 25th.

2236
02:58:55,120 --> 02:58:56,120
Oh.

2237
02:58:56,120 --> 02:58:57,120
It's Thursday.

2238
02:58:57,120 --> 02:58:58,120
Well, we'll see.

2239
02:58:58,120 --> 02:58:59,120
Plan on that Wednesday.

2240
02:58:59,120 --> 02:59:02,120
If you're not able to get your copy of Max 2, don't worry about it.

2241
02:59:02,120 --> 02:59:04,120
We're going to play it here and you can listen in.

2242
02:59:04,120 --> 02:59:07,120
We'd like to live stream your video instead of just like a webcam.

2243
02:59:07,120 --> 02:59:08,120
We'll see what we can do about that.

2244
02:59:08,120 --> 02:59:09,120
So stay tuned for that.

2245
02:59:09,120 --> 02:59:11,120
That'll be next Wednesday for sure.

2246
02:59:11,120 --> 02:59:17,800
This Wednesday we're going to have some surprise programming, who knows.

2247
02:59:17,800 --> 02:59:22,520
Now is the part of the show I believe it's time to go around and gather everyone's final

2248
02:59:22,520 --> 02:59:25,760
thoughts I think.

2249
02:59:25,760 --> 02:59:26,760
Unless anyone else has Bamani's?

2250
02:59:26,760 --> 02:59:29,760
No, they need to have the Oha Ska.

2251
02:59:29,760 --> 02:59:30,760
Oha.

2252
02:59:30,760 --> 02:59:31,760
Oha.

2253
02:59:31,760 --> 02:59:32,760
Oha.

2254
02:59:32,760 --> 02:59:33,760
Oha.

2255
02:59:33,760 --> 02:59:34,760
Oha.

2256
02:59:34,760 --> 02:59:35,760
Oha.

2257
02:59:35,760 --> 02:59:36,760
That would be cool.

2258
02:59:36,760 --> 02:59:38,620
Okay.

2259
02:59:38,620 --> 02:59:39,620
Final thoughts time.

2260
02:59:39,620 --> 02:59:40,660
I guess we're there.

2261
02:59:40,660 --> 02:59:42,660
Anybody else have anything they want to bring up?

2262
02:59:42,660 --> 02:59:47,660
Good, we can end this train wreck of a show.

2263
02:59:47,660 --> 02:59:48,660
What?

2264
02:59:48,660 --> 02:59:49,660
Play endearing music.

2265
02:59:49,660 --> 02:59:50,660
Play endearing music.

2266
02:59:50,660 --> 02:59:51,660
My point.

2267
02:59:51,660 --> 02:59:52,660
What do you want?

2268
02:59:52,660 --> 02:59:54,660
Give me a final thought, Dammit.

2269
02:59:54,660 --> 02:59:58,660
Give me a final thought.

2270
02:59:58,660 --> 02:59:59,660
College rules.

2271
02:59:59,660 --> 03:00:00,660
Lovely.

2272
03:00:00,660 --> 03:00:03,660
Bradley, do you have a final thought?

2273
03:00:03,660 --> 03:00:07,660
Slam it, cram it, jam it, dammit.

2274
03:00:07,660 --> 03:00:08,660
Okay.

2275
03:00:08,660 --> 03:00:13,660
Punkknight, muzzletuff, I hate you.

2276
03:00:17,660 --> 03:00:21,660
Jamie, oh, uh, Joey, do you have a final thought? No, he has no final thought.

2277
03:00:21,660 --> 03:00:28,660
Uh, what, you wanna go last? My final thought is, um, yay.

2278
03:00:28,660 --> 03:00:37,660
Loki, I'm gonna have an arcade cabinet and you don't, I'm gonna have an arcade cabinet and you don't.

2279
03:00:37,660 --> 03:00:55,660
My final thought is go to your local game shop and pre-order Transformers Season 3 boxset and sign up for replay.darksakra.com

2280
03:00:55,660 --> 03:01:06,660
And right after the show at 10pm, be sure to tune in to Conan O'Brien's 10th anniversary special, 9.30, 9.30, right, right now, right now, why are you all listening?

2281
03:01:08,660 --> 03:01:19,660
Alright, so I guess that's a sign we need to end this show then. Final word of the show, I'll give it to Joey. He gets one word, you say one word and it's the final word of the show, so what is the final word of the show?

2282
03:01:20,660 --> 03:01:21,660
P.A.C.E.

2283
03:01:21,660 --> 03:01:27,660
You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

2284
03:01:27,660 --> 03:01:32,100
