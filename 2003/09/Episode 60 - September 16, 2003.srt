1
00:00:08,157 --> 00:00:12,313
[SPEAKER_05]: Toto, I have a feeling we're not in Kansas anymore.

2
00:00:15,956 --> 00:00:20,820
[SPEAKER_08]: You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio, where mommy talks and then some.

3
00:00:21,521 --> 00:00:24,244
[SPEAKER_13]: Uh, mostly the and then some part of that.

4
00:00:24,604 --> 00:00:28,627
[SPEAKER_08]: Orange Lounge Radio is created by a bunch of potty-mouthed adults.

5
00:00:29,268 --> 00:00:34,072
[SPEAKER_08]: Orange Lounge may contain sexual, perverted, and mildly retarded content.

6
00:00:34,653 --> 00:00:38,356
[SPEAKER_08]: You probably shouldn't let your children listen to Orange Lounge Radio.

7
00:00:38,697 --> 00:00:40,178
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, I will spank your child.

8
00:00:40,578 --> 00:00:42,300
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're not going to do your job, goddammit, I will.

9
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:49,151
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, here's to my big opening.

10
00:00:49,712 --> 00:00:50,832
[SPEAKER_16]: A sphincter says what?

11
00:00:50,852 --> 00:00:53,134
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm super, thanks for asking.

12
00:00:53,494 --> 00:00:56,095
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, you little bitch troll from hell.

13
00:00:56,135 --> 00:00:58,137
[SPEAKER_01]: What am I doing here?

14
00:00:58,177 --> 00:00:59,717
[SPEAKER_16]: No.

15
00:00:59,958 --> 00:01:01,278
[SPEAKER_16]: Dodge this.

16
00:01:01,779 --> 00:01:03,620
[SPEAKER_16]: This is a tasty burger.

17
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:06,341
[SPEAKER_16]: Look, you stupid bastard, you've got no arms left.

18
00:01:06,561 --> 00:01:07,182
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, I have.

19
00:01:07,602 --> 00:01:09,403
[SPEAKER_16]: Look, there's a flesh wound.

20
00:01:09,623 --> 00:01:15,787
[SPEAKER_05]: Searching for a boy in high school is as useless as searching for meaning in a polyshorum.

21
00:01:16,835 --> 00:01:17,556
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah?

22
00:01:17,776 --> 00:01:21,038
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I hope your babies look like monkeys.

23
00:01:21,318 --> 00:01:22,379
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura.

24
00:01:22,559 --> 00:01:23,460
[SPEAKER_08]: I've had a sniff.

25
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:24,260
[SPEAKER_08]: Skye.

26
00:01:24,361 --> 00:01:26,442
[SPEAKER_08]: But I'm playing it for the bartender, so suffer.

27
00:01:26,822 --> 00:01:27,343
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki.

28
00:01:27,603 --> 00:01:28,604
[SPEAKER_08]: I hate you!

29
00:01:29,024 --> 00:01:31,085
[SPEAKER_14]: Orange Lounge Radio.

30
00:01:31,306 --> 00:01:32,246
[SPEAKER_14]: We're live!

31
00:01:32,306 --> 00:01:35,068
[SPEAKER_14]: This is episode 60 for September 14th.

32
00:01:37,386 --> 00:01:43,948
[SPEAKER_14]: 2003.

33
00:01:37,826 --> 00:01:43,948
[SPEAKER_14]: You're tuned into the Vimani Scene's most late show of all things Vimani.

34
00:01:44,348 --> 00:01:46,049
[SPEAKER_14]: My name is Loki.

35
00:01:48,029 --> 00:01:50,870
[SPEAKER_14]: And, well, Rob's not here because he's a slacker.

36
00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:53,331
[SPEAKER_14]: He is a slacker.

37
00:01:54,891 --> 00:01:55,831
[SPEAKER_14]: We're on time.

38
00:01:55,851 --> 00:01:56,371
[SPEAKER_14]: Where is he?

39
00:01:56,752 --> 00:01:59,552
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's start with the fuckies of the week.

40
00:01:59,852 --> 00:02:00,573
[SPEAKER_06]: Dear Rob...

41
00:02:02,432 --> 00:02:07,015
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, and in this corner, the happiest bunny on the farm, DarkSakura.

42
00:02:07,616 --> 00:02:07,816
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi.

43
00:02:08,617 --> 00:02:09,337
[SPEAKER_07]: I have a sandwich.

44
00:02:10,138 --> 00:02:10,678
[SPEAKER_07]: It's tasty.

45
00:02:10,698 --> 00:02:14,321
[SPEAKER_07]: I have cookies, too, and I'm going to maul anyone who touches them.

46
00:02:14,901 --> 00:02:15,182
[SPEAKER_13]: Cool.

47
00:02:16,122 --> 00:02:17,443
[SPEAKER_13]: And in this corner, we have Rob.

48
00:02:17,703 --> 00:02:18,704
[SPEAKER_13]: Hi, I'm Rob.

49
00:02:18,884 --> 00:02:21,466
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm not here right now, but please take a message.

50
00:02:22,907 --> 00:02:23,388
Beep.

51
00:02:23,408 --> 00:02:23,488
Beep.

52
00:02:24,956 --> 00:02:38,106
[SPEAKER_14]: Today we're going to be talking about lots of Omani stuff and other things and what we did this week and my birthday because I rock and other things.

53
00:02:38,846 --> 00:02:40,507
[SPEAKER_14]: Also in the studio we have a few guests.

54
00:02:41,848 --> 00:02:42,429
[SPEAKER_14]: Two guests.

55
00:02:43,149 --> 00:02:46,612
[SPEAKER_14]: Hey, we're going to have a few by the time this show is over, okay?

56
00:02:47,212 --> 00:02:50,314
[SPEAKER_13]: First off, we have Arcadian42, Bradley.

57
00:02:50,835 --> 00:02:52,016
[SPEAKER_13]: Hey, I played in the college.

58
00:02:52,056 --> 00:02:52,516
[SPEAKER_13]: Can you see me?

59
00:02:54,528 --> 00:03:02,215
[SPEAKER_13]: and also, been away for a while, our correspondent from the People's Republic of Davis, Puppy.

60
00:03:02,616 --> 00:03:07,160
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, and speaking of tardiness himself, here comes... Uh-oh, Fizz.

61
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:08,841
[SPEAKER_14]: Who's this poking in the door?

62
00:03:09,662 --> 00:03:10,883
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, my God!

63
00:03:11,304 --> 00:03:14,567
[SPEAKER_12]: I thought you said you weren't going to be here until 7.

64
00:03:15,567 --> 00:03:16,368
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, you're late.

65
00:03:16,548 --> 00:03:17,549
[SPEAKER_12]: Introduce yourself, Dan.

66
00:03:19,231 --> 00:03:20,112
[SPEAKER_12]: Hi, everybody.

67
00:03:21,621 --> 00:03:22,181
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm late.

68
00:03:22,242 --> 00:03:24,443
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm sorry we're late, but we'll get into that later.

69
00:03:24,463 --> 00:03:25,824
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh my god, does that mean you're pregnant?

70
00:03:26,325 --> 00:03:26,785
[SPEAKER_13]: No, I'm not.

71
00:03:27,426 --> 00:03:28,126
[SPEAKER_13]: Not that kind of late.

72
00:03:33,170 --> 00:03:33,570
[SPEAKER_06]: Go eat.

73
00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:34,891
[SPEAKER_13]: So, yeah.

74
00:03:35,372 --> 00:03:36,032
I don't have food.

75
00:03:36,252 --> 00:03:40,716
[SPEAKER_13]: We haven't eaten since Burger King at like noon, so I thought we were going to get food.

76
00:03:41,416 --> 00:03:42,317
[SPEAKER_13]: We didn't have time to stop.

77
00:03:42,457 --> 00:03:43,018
[SPEAKER_13]: You have cookies?

78
00:03:43,798 --> 00:03:44,179
[SPEAKER_13]: Cookies?

79
00:03:44,699 --> 00:03:45,279
[SPEAKER_13]: What kind of cookies?

80
00:03:45,299 --> 00:03:46,640
[SPEAKER_13]: Not yours.

81
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:47,181
[SPEAKER_13]: Not yours.

82
00:03:48,871 --> 00:03:51,392
[SPEAKER_13]: By the way, everybody, well, you guys already met, but Jamie hasn't met.

83
00:03:51,412 --> 00:03:52,312
[SPEAKER_13]: Jamie, this is Joey.

84
00:03:53,172 --> 00:03:53,812
[SPEAKER_13]: Joey, Jamie.

85
00:03:54,492 --> 00:03:55,553
[SPEAKER_13]: Listeners, this is Joey.

86
00:03:56,233 --> 00:03:57,033
[SPEAKER_13]: Hey, how's it going?

87
00:03:57,613 --> 00:03:58,213
[SPEAKER_13]: Joey, listeners.

88
00:03:58,333 --> 00:04:01,534
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, so we should take a break.

89
00:04:02,694 --> 00:04:03,474
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, we should.

90
00:04:03,654 --> 00:04:06,795
[SPEAKER_13]: I think we should take that opening break that we usually do right about now.

91
00:04:06,815 --> 00:04:10,496
[SPEAKER_14]: We're going to start off this break with the first few MP3s I find.

92
00:04:15,166 --> 00:04:17,748
[SPEAKER_14]: So we've got, uh, looks like, um... Wait, here, here, here.

93
00:04:17,888 --> 00:04:18,348
[SPEAKER_14]: Hey!

94
00:04:18,428 --> 00:04:19,088
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, you got it?

95
00:04:19,349 --> 00:04:19,929
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

96
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:25,953
[SPEAKER_03]: This is gonna be pretty much random stuff, so, uh... Yeah.

97
00:04:27,554 --> 00:04:29,615
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, um, yeah, enjoy.

98
00:05:16,592 --> 00:05:19,774
I don't know, she was in the mood for talking

99
00:06:25,615 --> 00:06:26,536
Thank you for watching!

100
00:08:35,058 --> 00:08:36,559
Thanks for watching!

101
00:09:25,364 --> 00:09:25,965
Thanks for watching!

102
00:10:02,925 --> 00:10:09,250
[SPEAKER_16]: Step Squad to Orange Lounge!

103
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:13,613
[SPEAKER_17]: This DDR sucks!

104
00:10:13,633 --> 00:10:14,333
[SPEAKER_12]: Holler!

105
00:10:17,415 --> 00:10:22,139
[SPEAKER_13]: Hello everybody and welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 60 in progress.

106
00:10:23,259 --> 00:10:23,920
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm a little late.

107
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:26,122
[SPEAKER_13]: I was a couple minutes late.

108
00:10:26,642 --> 00:10:27,162
[SPEAKER_13]: Sorry guys.

109
00:10:27,903 --> 00:10:28,283
[SPEAKER_13]: My bad.

110
00:10:28,703 --> 00:10:29,424
[SPEAKER_13]: Blame traffic.

111
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:34,300
[SPEAKER_13]: You know what?

112
00:10:35,581 --> 00:10:38,663
[SPEAKER_13]: The traffic in... Nobody can hear you anyway, and that's a good thing.

113
00:10:39,083 --> 00:10:41,444
[SPEAKER_13]: The traffic in... Where the hell was that?

114
00:10:41,464 --> 00:10:42,925
[SPEAKER_13]: Where 680 meets... Fairfield.

115
00:10:43,645 --> 00:10:44,506
[SPEAKER_13]: Fairfield was horrible.

116
00:10:44,566 --> 00:10:51,810
[SPEAKER_13]: Because one guy crashes on the side of the road, and everybody has to turn their head and see if they can look at a dead body.

117
00:10:52,730 --> 00:10:53,370
[SPEAKER_13]: Never fails.

118
00:10:53,450 --> 00:10:54,811
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I think I see an arm!

119
00:10:55,071 --> 00:10:56,432
[SPEAKER_13]: Exactly, exactly.

120
00:10:57,132 --> 00:10:58,233
[SPEAKER_07]: It looks kind of severed.

121
00:10:59,322 --> 00:11:02,444
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm very proud of you guys getting things going anyway, though.

122
00:11:02,704 --> 00:11:06,087
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, not that Jamie hasn't done it before, certainly, because remember, we took off for L.A.

123
00:11:06,127 --> 00:11:07,708
[SPEAKER_13]: for a couple times.

124
00:11:08,068 --> 00:11:13,512
[SPEAKER_07]: And although Loki picked me... And everyone decided to abandon me to go downstairs and watch the biography of Ron Jeremy.

125
00:11:15,133 --> 00:11:21,497
[SPEAKER_13]: And even though Loki picked the chicken dance for first break music, I forgive him anyway.

126
00:11:24,099 --> 00:11:24,860
[SPEAKER_07]: It was cute.

127
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:27,281
[SPEAKER_07]: It was a nice deviation.

128
00:11:27,441 --> 00:11:31,224
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, it was a good deviation from a seven minute version of Kind Lady.

129
00:11:31,244 --> 00:11:37,329
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, don't get me wrong, I love Kind Lady, but shit, there's only so much of that song I can take.

130
00:11:38,830 --> 00:11:40,451
[SPEAKER_06]: You just feel the disco groove.

131
00:11:41,758 --> 00:11:43,420
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

132
00:12:04,153 --> 00:12:05,234
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

133
00:12:23,826 --> 00:12:28,029
[SPEAKER_07]: I was on antibiotics all week, which had me not able to eat anything.

134
00:12:28,869 --> 00:12:35,173
[SPEAKER_07]: And then my inhaler that made me all shaky, and this other stuff that's like snorting like fire.

135
00:12:36,874 --> 00:12:37,734
[SPEAKER_07]: Tastes like burning.

136
00:12:38,094 --> 00:12:40,176
[SPEAKER_07]: It sucked.

137
00:12:40,716 --> 00:12:43,197
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like snorting vomit-flavored jelly bellies.

138
00:12:44,178 --> 00:12:45,198
[SPEAKER_07]: Like the Harry Potter ones.

139
00:12:45,659 --> 00:12:45,799
[SPEAKER_13]: Ew.

140
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:48,140
[SPEAKER_13]: I think we still have some.

141
00:12:49,121 --> 00:12:49,441
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, no.

142
00:12:50,131 --> 00:12:50,931
[SPEAKER_13]: Puppy!

143
00:12:51,571 --> 00:12:53,592
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, puppy, let's try it.

144
00:12:53,812 --> 00:12:56,112
[SPEAKER_07]: This has been it for a month and a half.

145
00:12:58,933 --> 00:13:00,533
[SPEAKER_13]: For God's sake, we need to get those out of there.

146
00:13:03,394 --> 00:13:06,174
[SPEAKER_07]: But anyway, it was basically dull.

147
00:13:06,314 --> 00:13:09,775
[SPEAKER_07]: I came home feeling too tired, too sick to do much of anything.

148
00:13:10,735 --> 00:13:14,716
[SPEAKER_07]: And then, to top all that off, my car starts behaving very badly.

149
00:13:15,836 --> 00:13:17,977
[SPEAKER_07]: As in stopping every time I stop.

150
00:13:18,017 --> 00:13:19,257
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to be getting into my car later.

151
00:13:19,932 --> 00:13:27,216
[SPEAKER_13]: I kind of remember that because I remember when we were driving places doing that vroom vroom thing that my old car used to do.

152
00:13:27,436 --> 00:13:41,883
[SPEAKER_07]: But it was really doing it very badly and finally it does it at every stop so I decided Friday, I was going to take it in Saturday anyway to have it looked at but I just did it Friday afternoon because I was so tired of it and I went in on Saturday to a

153
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:45,401
[SPEAKER_07]: Go check it out.

154
00:13:45,621 --> 00:13:48,765
[SPEAKER_07]: And apparently the compression is all messed up.

155
00:13:49,265 --> 00:13:50,106
[SPEAKER_07]: The one side is good.

156
00:13:50,867 --> 00:13:51,828
[SPEAKER_07]: The other side is good.

157
00:13:51,908 --> 00:13:55,352
[SPEAKER_07]: The middle is sunken on my engine.

158
00:13:55,973 --> 00:13:57,475
[SPEAKER_07]: Like at an incline, sunken.

159
00:13:58,456 --> 00:14:03,461
[SPEAKER_07]: So basically, here's the total cost of what I've spent on my car.

160
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:07,662
[SPEAKER_07]: I have had, you know, little tiny things replaced.

161
00:14:08,342 --> 00:14:19,908
[SPEAKER_07]: I spent nearly $800 having the brakes fixed, catalytic converter put in, a new front axle, and then, not to mention, the oxygen sensor I had replaced much earlier.

162
00:14:20,548 --> 00:14:23,610
[SPEAKER_07]: And now they're saying it's going to cost $1,800 to fix my car.

163
00:14:25,371 --> 00:14:28,112
[SPEAKER_07]: And they likely need a new engine and a back-end rebuild.

164
00:14:28,512 --> 00:14:29,192
[SPEAKER_13]: Who'd you take it to?

165
00:14:29,212 --> 00:14:30,073
[SPEAKER_07]: I went to Meineke.

166
00:14:31,144 --> 00:14:31,504
[SPEAKER_07]: www.DarkSakura.com

167
00:14:47,717 --> 00:14:50,499
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, you should see, because remember Loki's story?

168
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:53,822
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know if this was last week, but you had the brake issue going on.

169
00:14:54,503 --> 00:14:55,103
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, that was this one.

170
00:14:55,123 --> 00:14:55,423
[SPEAKER_13]: My bad.

171
00:14:55,704 --> 00:14:56,845
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't want to ruin the story then.

172
00:14:56,925 --> 00:15:00,968
[SPEAKER_07]: What we're going to do is we're just going to do a patch job on the engine and make it drivable.

173
00:15:01,008 --> 00:15:03,670
[SPEAKER_07]: But in the meantime, Julie's offered to let me use her car.

174
00:15:04,111 --> 00:15:04,811
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, what a sweetheart.

175
00:15:05,852 --> 00:15:12,658
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, her old car, which went fine, but we tried to take off the dash last night to put in a fan switch because her old fan switch doesn't work.

176
00:15:13,138 --> 00:15:13,919
[SPEAKER_07]: And we just gave up.

177
00:15:13,939 --> 00:15:15,220
[SPEAKER_07]: We're like, we're going to let the men's do it.

178
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:15,820
[SPEAKER_07]: So...

179
00:15:16,781 --> 00:15:19,543
[SPEAKER_07]: Dan and them were supposed to go over, but I couldn't get a hold of her all day.

180
00:15:22,364 --> 00:15:25,486
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, normally when I hear, oh, you fucker, I look over and go, what?

181
00:15:27,687 --> 00:15:29,067
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but it wasn't directed at you.

182
00:15:29,148 --> 00:15:29,928
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I don't mean me.

183
00:15:30,008 --> 00:15:30,768
[SPEAKER_07]: I was meaning what's without.

184
00:15:30,788 --> 00:15:31,329
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just kidding.

185
00:15:32,949 --> 00:15:33,990
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, you can shut up.

186
00:15:34,050 --> 00:15:34,991
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not supposed to hear it at you.

187
00:15:36,111 --> 00:15:38,392
[SPEAKER_14]: Piece number 47 of 47 of Beatmania Complete Mix 2 was 68% done.

188
00:15:38,472 --> 00:15:39,193
[SPEAKER_14]: Now it's a 404 on the internet.

189
00:15:46,482 --> 00:15:48,864
[SPEAKER_03]: Might add that each piece is 50 megs in size.

190
00:15:50,265 --> 00:15:50,565
[SPEAKER_07]: Dough.

191
00:15:51,005 --> 00:15:51,306
[SPEAKER_03]: Dough.

192
00:15:52,787 --> 00:16:03,575
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, so my Saturday was composed of lots of... I went to Mimi's Cafe because I'd never eaten there before.

193
00:16:03,595 --> 00:16:04,255
[SPEAKER_07]: They were pretty good.

194
00:16:05,436 --> 00:16:06,377
[SPEAKER_07]: I bought a car battery.

195
00:16:07,017 --> 00:16:07,638
[SPEAKER_07]: Go to Sam's Club.

196
00:16:07,658 --> 00:16:08,178
[SPEAKER_07]: They're $47.

197
00:16:11,841 --> 00:16:12,962
[SPEAKER_07]: I bought the fan switch.

198
00:16:13,542 --> 00:16:14,683
[SPEAKER_07]: I bought a multi-tool.

199
00:16:14,703 --> 00:16:15,784
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's in my pocket still.

200
00:16:16,661 --> 00:16:17,641
[SPEAKER_07]: I have a multi-tool.

201
00:16:17,741 --> 00:16:18,862
[SPEAKER_07]: I feel handy.

202
00:16:21,963 --> 00:16:22,703
[SPEAKER_07]: Hold my multi-tool up.

203
00:16:22,723 --> 00:16:23,503
[SPEAKER_07]: Put it on the camera for me.

204
00:16:24,003 --> 00:16:24,323
[SPEAKER_07]: Go up there.

205
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:26,964
[SPEAKER_07]: No, like, stand with me and put it on the camera.

206
00:16:27,084 --> 00:16:27,424
[SPEAKER_07]: Geez.

207
00:16:28,085 --> 00:16:29,405
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I'm lazy and you're not.

208
00:16:30,425 --> 00:16:31,326
[SPEAKER_07]: That's my multi-tool.

209
00:16:31,706 --> 00:16:32,346
[SPEAKER_07]: It's really neat.

210
00:16:34,667 --> 00:16:36,687
[SPEAKER_07]: And it was $3.

211
00:16:37,427 --> 00:16:40,188
[SPEAKER_07]: So that was the cheapest thing I bought all day.

212
00:16:40,348 --> 00:16:41,749
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we...

213
00:16:43,402 --> 00:16:45,443
[SPEAKER_07]: I went to TGI Fridays last night.

214
00:16:46,123 --> 00:16:49,645
[SPEAKER_07]: After Julie and I were in the middle of a massive game of Phantasy Star, I'm like, give me that.

215
00:16:50,125 --> 00:16:51,265
[SPEAKER_07]: Give me, give me my knife.

216
00:16:52,826 --> 00:17:01,010
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, I am, I'm still into my Rite and Rock online, however, I am now back in the highly addictive world of PSO-pium.

217
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:07,472
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, you chose to take your PSO break, like, right when I started playing, and now that I'm done with it.

218
00:17:07,552 --> 00:17:08,673
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm playing it on Xbox now.

219
00:17:09,153 --> 00:17:10,734
[SPEAKER_13]: I think you're avoiding me, is what it is.

220
00:17:13,303 --> 00:17:15,424
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not avoiding you, Rob.

221
00:17:15,624 --> 00:17:16,685
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to go in here.

222
00:17:18,065 --> 00:17:18,306
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

223
00:17:20,006 --> 00:17:23,328
[SPEAKER_07]: But that's basically it, and I haven't heard anything about getting the Sentra today, so.

224
00:17:24,409 --> 00:17:26,130
[SPEAKER_07]: And I have to take the Tercel out again.

225
00:17:26,230 --> 00:17:29,391
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm very upset that the Vic Viper has finally crashed and burned.

226
00:17:29,811 --> 00:17:32,773
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm thinking of getting, sort of looking at an Echo.

227
00:17:34,374 --> 00:17:34,994
[SPEAKER_07]: An Echo.

228
00:17:36,275 --> 00:17:38,716
[SPEAKER_07]: They're blue, and if I get one, it's going to be the Twinbee.

229
00:17:43,675 --> 00:17:44,535
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm a nerd.

230
00:17:45,895 --> 00:17:47,296
[SPEAKER_07]: And I hadn't touched any Bimani all week.

231
00:17:48,936 --> 00:17:49,557
[SPEAKER_13]: Good for you.

232
00:17:49,857 --> 00:17:50,477
[SPEAKER_07]: End of story.

233
00:17:52,098 --> 00:17:54,898
[SPEAKER_13]: Because you always have to ask since technically we're supposed to be a Bimani show.

234
00:17:55,459 --> 00:17:59,080
[SPEAKER_07]: We worked some more on my message board today.

235
00:18:00,106 --> 00:18:01,728
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to give myself a shameless plug on this.

236
00:18:01,888 --> 00:18:03,610
[SPEAKER_13]: I was going to say, do you want to give yourself a shameless plug?

237
00:18:03,911 --> 00:18:07,054
[SPEAKER_07]: roleplay.darksakura.com Sign up there.

238
00:18:07,094 --> 00:18:10,539
[SPEAKER_07]: If you want to run a free form RPG on the message board, sign up.

239
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:14,263
[SPEAKER_07]: I will set it up for you and make you a moderator of your own forum.

240
00:18:15,204 --> 00:18:16,406
[SPEAKER_07]: And if you want to discuss any...

241
00:18:17,347 --> 00:18:17,827
[SPEAKER_07]: Roleplays.

242
00:18:18,307 --> 00:18:24,128
[SPEAKER_07]: Coming soon, I'm going to be implementing MMORPG forum on there for Phantasy Star Online Ragnarok.

243
00:18:24,248 --> 00:18:27,529
[SPEAKER_07]: And I may even put a stupid little Puzzle Pirates on there.

244
00:18:27,869 --> 00:18:30,450
[SPEAKER_13]: You know what though, Jer's got a great Puzzle Pirates forum.

245
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:31,410
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm still going to put one on.

246
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:31,830
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright.

247
00:18:33,010 --> 00:18:38,051
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm going to put one on for actual video games.

248
00:18:38,251 --> 00:18:42,172
[SPEAKER_07]: And yes, we're going to have the Battle Royale RPG discussion forum.

249
00:18:43,393 --> 00:18:47,615
[SPEAKER_07]: We could do a message board style one while we're working on the tabletop one, too.

250
00:18:48,916 --> 00:18:51,036
[SPEAKER_13]: I actually signed up for your message board the other day, finally.

251
00:18:51,537 --> 00:18:51,937
[SPEAKER_07]: Yay!

252
00:18:51,957 --> 00:18:56,539
[SPEAKER_13]: When you called and you wanted me to relay a message, it kind of reminded me, oh, I should go sign up for her board.

253
00:18:57,999 --> 00:18:59,220
[SPEAKER_07]: My boards are really awesome.

254
00:18:59,360 --> 00:18:59,920
[SPEAKER_07]: Sign up for them.

255
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:05,122
[SPEAKER_07]: Everybody must or I'll steal your soul and feed it to my cat so that she can poop it in her litter box.

256
00:19:06,923 --> 00:19:07,743
[SPEAKER_13]: What a lovely thought.

257
00:19:07,783 --> 00:19:08,164
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

258
00:19:08,584 --> 00:19:08,964
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm done.

259
00:19:10,464 --> 00:19:13,086
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, then let's go on to Bradley.

260
00:19:14,667 --> 00:19:15,308
[SPEAKER_13]: Hello, by the way.

261
00:19:15,568 --> 00:19:15,908
[SPEAKER_13]: How are you?

262
00:19:15,928 --> 00:19:16,649
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm okay.

263
00:19:17,169 --> 00:19:17,610
[SPEAKER_13]: How was your week?

264
00:19:17,630 --> 00:19:18,030
[SPEAKER_13]: How was your day?

265
00:19:19,811 --> 00:19:20,552
[SPEAKER_13]: Pretty uneventful.

266
00:19:20,772 --> 00:19:21,993
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm looking for a job.

267
00:19:25,035 --> 00:19:27,757
[SPEAKER_13]: That's basically everything I did this week.

268
00:19:28,498 --> 00:19:33,021
[SPEAKER_13]: And then I went to QZAR yesterday, and we'll probably talk about it later with the group.

269
00:19:34,502 --> 00:19:36,084
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, QZAR.

270
00:19:36,784 --> 00:19:38,646
[SPEAKER_13]: Loki or me is going to talk about QZAR in a minute here.

271
00:19:38,746 --> 00:19:39,206
[SPEAKER_13]: Don't worry about it.

272
00:19:40,653 --> 00:19:43,934
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know if I did anything else interesting at all.

273
00:19:46,195 --> 00:19:48,055
[SPEAKER_13]: I only played one game of DDR and that was yesterday.

274
00:19:52,677 --> 00:19:55,558
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, Jamie's... Jamie, you did that under my name.

275
00:19:55,618 --> 00:19:57,058
[SPEAKER_13]: Now I get all the credit for that kick.

276
00:19:58,578 --> 00:19:59,299
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't care.

277
00:20:01,199 --> 00:20:03,220
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, you're always nice when you kick people.

278
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:05,240
[SPEAKER_07]: Or you say something silly.

279
00:20:05,341 --> 00:20:06,781
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just like, because you suck.

280
00:20:07,661 --> 00:20:09,082
[SPEAKER_07]: Or die or something.

281
00:20:09,142 --> 00:20:10,142
[SPEAKER_07]: So they know it's me anyway.

282
00:20:12,870 --> 00:20:13,671
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyway, okay.

283
00:20:14,051 --> 00:20:15,812
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm sorry to so rudely interrupt you.

284
00:20:15,832 --> 00:20:18,793
[SPEAKER_13]: It's not much to interrupt if I'm not saying much of anything.

285
00:20:19,734 --> 00:20:21,595
[SPEAKER_13]: Was there any interesting things you did this week?

286
00:20:21,655 --> 00:20:23,516
[SPEAKER_13]: Any Bomani accomplishments or anything?

287
00:20:24,096 --> 00:20:24,236
[SPEAKER_13]: No.

288
00:20:24,797 --> 00:20:24,957
[SPEAKER_13]: No?

289
00:20:26,417 --> 00:20:26,858
[SPEAKER_13]: It's all good.

290
00:20:28,619 --> 00:20:30,460
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, well, moving on then.

291
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:31,500
[SPEAKER_10]: Puppy?

292
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:32,941
[SPEAKER_10]: I got a microphone again.

293
00:20:33,181 --> 00:20:33,381
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

294
00:20:33,501 --> 00:20:33,781
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

295
00:20:33,801 --> 00:20:35,902
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are we talking about again?

296
00:20:36,303 --> 00:20:36,903
[SPEAKER_13]: How was your week?

297
00:20:36,923 --> 00:20:37,443
[SPEAKER_13]: How was your day?

298
00:20:37,763 --> 00:20:39,504
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, let's see.

299
00:20:39,624 --> 00:20:40,485
[SPEAKER_00]: For my week...

300
00:20:43,965 --> 00:20:56,894
[SPEAKER_10]: I didn't work this week because I was busy spending every single day packing all my stuff into large cardboard boxes so I can throw it in the back of a truck and drive up to Davis and move into my new apartment, which is actually pretty good.

301
00:20:57,314 --> 00:20:59,295
[SPEAKER_13]: Hooray for not being in the dorms anymore, huh?

302
00:20:59,335 --> 00:20:59,595
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

303
00:20:59,755 --> 00:21:04,619
[SPEAKER_13]: I remember when I moved out of the dorms in my own apartment, it was like, oh my god, life is great.

304
00:21:04,779 --> 00:21:05,039
[SPEAKER_00]: I know.

305
00:21:05,659 --> 00:21:10,883
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually have my car now, too, so I can, you know, leave whenever I need to.

306
00:21:12,103 --> 00:21:12,884
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's good.

307
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:40,847
[SPEAKER_10]: and then uh I went to Scandia earlier today and tried to play 2DX but the damn figures at the right side has to be broken the damn key keeps like freaking out or something and then um I played like one game of DDR and got too tired haha old I know I'm getting old dammit it must be college

308
00:21:42,383 --> 00:21:43,163
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't want to go there.

309
00:22:12,910 --> 00:22:18,212
[SPEAKER_10]: I know what to do about camping, because I've been going camping at the same place for like 12 years, so I know the place.

310
00:22:18,233 --> 00:22:19,313
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, don't I feel like an ass?

311
00:22:19,353 --> 00:22:19,753
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm sorry.

312
00:22:22,194 --> 00:22:22,955
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, you should!

313
00:22:26,596 --> 00:22:31,339
[SPEAKER_00]: And now I'm watching Loki type something on the TV computer thing.

314
00:22:31,759 --> 00:22:34,580
[SPEAKER_13]: Any other exciting events you want to share about your week?

315
00:22:37,001 --> 00:22:38,622
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty much before yesterday...

316
00:22:40,082 --> 00:22:42,285
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, I did get to go to Ikea for the first time.

317
00:22:42,365 --> 00:22:43,546
[SPEAKER_13]: Ikea is so studly.

318
00:22:44,527 --> 00:22:45,087
[SPEAKER_13]: I love going to Ikea.

319
00:22:45,147 --> 00:22:46,529
[SPEAKER_13]: It's fucking scary, okay?

320
00:22:46,709 --> 00:22:47,650
[SPEAKER_13]: Why do you think Ikea is scary?

321
00:22:47,730 --> 00:22:49,391
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a big blue furniture Death Star.

322
00:22:50,232 --> 00:22:50,913
[SPEAKER_13]: That's what it is.

323
00:22:51,053 --> 00:22:52,975
[SPEAKER_13]: It's not a big blue furniture Death Star.

324
00:22:53,035 --> 00:22:54,697
[SPEAKER_13]: It is the cool.

325
00:22:54,837 --> 00:22:55,758
[SPEAKER_13]: I love Ikea.

326
00:22:56,078 --> 00:22:56,979
[SPEAKER_13]: Like, it's...

327
00:22:59,818 --> 00:23:03,019
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, Ikea is beautiful because it's just everything in a box.

328
00:23:03,319 --> 00:23:09,041
[SPEAKER_13]: You can get a chair in a box, a lamp in a box, a recliner in a box, couch in a box, tea in a box.

329
00:23:09,181 --> 00:23:11,802
[SPEAKER_13]: Whatever you want, you can get it in a box, take it home, put it together.

330
00:23:12,462 --> 00:23:13,082
[SPEAKER_13]: But that's the problem.

331
00:23:13,102 --> 00:23:14,723
[SPEAKER_13]: You have to put the damn shit together.

332
00:23:14,743 --> 00:23:15,603
[SPEAKER_13]: It's like Legos.

333
00:23:15,723 --> 00:23:16,904
[SPEAKER_13]: Can't you read instructions?

334
00:23:18,584 --> 00:23:19,645
[SPEAKER_13]: What's to read?

335
00:23:19,785 --> 00:23:21,285
[SPEAKER_13]: It's in 12 different languages.

336
00:23:21,945 --> 00:23:22,306
[SPEAKER_12]: No.

337
00:23:23,486 --> 00:23:25,447
[SPEAKER_12]: I bought a desk and a dresser.

338
00:23:27,447 --> 00:23:29,248
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm going to Reno next Saturday, sorry.

339
00:23:30,768 --> 00:23:39,796
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, well, I bought a desk and a dresser and a TV stand for my apartment, and now I spent all of Saturday putting that crap together.

340
00:23:39,996 --> 00:23:42,538
[SPEAKER_12]: There was not one word in the instructions.

341
00:23:42,718 --> 00:23:50,385
[SPEAKER_12]: It was some weird transgender-looking character pointing out things in pictograms.

342
00:23:51,786 --> 00:23:52,867
[SPEAKER_10]: It was weird.

343
00:23:53,107 --> 00:23:56,690
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like the Swedes are trying to, like, take us over.

344
00:23:56,871 --> 00:23:58,412
[SPEAKER_13]: For those who don't know, the Swedish on Ikea.

345
00:24:00,238 --> 00:24:02,939
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't think they have Ikea outside of California.

346
00:24:02,959 --> 00:24:03,479
[SPEAKER_13]: I could be wrong.

347
00:24:03,599 --> 00:24:05,900
[SPEAKER_10]: I thought there was Ikea outside of California.

348
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:07,041
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, I mean, obviously in Sweden.

349
00:24:07,661 --> 00:24:07,941
[SPEAKER_13]: Is there?

350
00:24:07,961 --> 00:24:13,103
[SPEAKER_11]: There's actually one over in Schaumburg, Illinois, outside of Chicago.

351
00:24:14,103 --> 00:24:14,463
[SPEAKER_11]: Damn.

352
00:24:15,384 --> 00:24:18,785
[SPEAKER_11]: And the only reason why I know this is because I've got a couple of friends that live in Schaumburg.

353
00:24:19,225 --> 00:24:22,366
[SPEAKER_11]: And that Ikea blows the one in Emerville out of the water.

354
00:24:22,666 --> 00:24:24,947
[SPEAKER_11]: It is like seven stories tall.

355
00:24:25,367 --> 00:24:26,808
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh my God, that's so hot.

356
00:24:26,828 --> 00:24:27,428
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's freaking huge.

357
00:24:29,062 --> 00:24:31,744
[SPEAKER_11]: That IKEA place is so big.

358
00:24:33,286 --> 00:24:36,508
[SPEAKER_13]: Size is everything at IKEA, I just like to say.

359
00:24:37,109 --> 00:24:38,090
[SPEAKER_13]: Seven stories.

360
00:24:38,430 --> 00:24:39,071
[SPEAKER_13]: That's nuts.

361
00:24:39,671 --> 00:24:42,233
[SPEAKER_13]: Wow, I'm having to fan myself thinking about that.

362
00:24:43,214 --> 00:24:48,659
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, but they need to learn that particle board is not the best material for furniture.

363
00:24:50,948 --> 00:25:01,017
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, I put my dresser together at the helm of my roommate, and we tried to move it into my closet, and as we're lifting it up, snap, there goes a board on the front of the dresser.

364
00:25:04,008 --> 00:25:04,608
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you for watching!

365
00:25:24,219 --> 00:25:47,186
[SPEAKER_13]: and we bought a chair that Navi had seen there like three months ago he really wanted so we bought it and then we all took it back to his house and put it together it was so much fun because you had to blow up these big like air bricks type things so we had to get out the thing that you use to inflate a tent it was so much yes because you would blow air in it and it was shaped like a brick kind of it was just a big brick you had to build it out of these air bricks

366
00:25:48,331 --> 00:26:02,481
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, you built it out of air bricks, and then you put the cover, you put the bricks together, and then you cover it, you put the covering over it, like, it takes two of you to put the covering over it, and then you have this big air chair that's so much fun, like, I told him if he ever had sex in it, it would be fun, but anyway.

367
00:26:03,841 --> 00:26:06,323
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, sex topic just went over my head.

368
00:26:06,343 --> 00:26:10,586
[SPEAKER_13]: Rocking, and a little bit of this is all falling over, or popping.

369
00:26:12,167 --> 00:26:13,028
[SPEAKER_13]: Don't rock this boat.

370
00:26:14,328 --> 00:26:17,951
[SPEAKER_10]: But still, I mean, particle board does not make good furniture, and they need to

371
00:26:18,456 --> 00:26:19,136
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

372
00:26:48,936 --> 00:26:49,496
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

373
00:26:52,737 --> 00:26:54,197
[SPEAKER_10]: I got all this stuff put together.

374
00:26:54,217 --> 00:26:55,538
[SPEAKER_14]: It's all about the watches.

375
00:26:55,898 --> 00:26:56,978
[SPEAKER_13]: Watches and clocks.

376
00:26:59,099 --> 00:27:02,079
[SPEAKER_13]: They're going to drive us insane by putting clocks everywhere.

377
00:27:02,099 --> 00:27:05,380
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, that did not look right.

378
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:06,201
[SPEAKER_13]: Did you ever see Hook?

379
00:27:06,741 --> 00:27:07,181
[SPEAKER_13]: Just like that.

380
00:27:08,781 --> 00:27:10,222
[SPEAKER_13]: That did not look right from this angle.

381
00:27:12,042 --> 00:27:13,242
[SPEAKER_13]: You're a sicko.

382
00:27:14,803 --> 00:27:15,163
[SPEAKER_13]: Whatever.

383
00:27:16,227 --> 00:27:17,548
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, too bad we're not on TV.

384
00:27:17,648 --> 00:27:17,989
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyway.

385
00:27:18,569 --> 00:27:19,870
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, we do have the cam.

386
00:27:19,910 --> 00:27:20,371
[SPEAKER_13]: We have the cam.

387
00:27:20,411 --> 00:27:20,751
[SPEAKER_13]: I forgot.

388
00:27:20,791 --> 00:27:21,612
[SPEAKER_13]: And the cam updates even faster now.

389
00:27:21,632 --> 00:27:22,933
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, but it's not pointing in your direction.

390
00:27:23,354 --> 00:27:25,596
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, I forgot to whore out our chat room.

391
00:27:25,696 --> 00:27:26,036
[SPEAKER_13]: My bad.

392
00:27:26,336 --> 00:27:26,797
[SPEAKER_10]: Do it then.

393
00:27:27,037 --> 00:27:27,778
[SPEAKER_13]: Did you guys already do it?

394
00:27:27,838 --> 00:27:28,318
[SPEAKER_13]: Do it.

395
00:27:28,478 --> 00:27:29,099
[SPEAKER_13]: Do it.

402
00:27:46,634 --> 00:27:53,676
[SPEAKER_13]: We made a purchase this week, or last week I should say, and we're planning to put that purchase to use soon.

403
00:27:53,776 --> 00:27:55,876
[SPEAKER_10]: What kind of purchase would this be?

404
00:27:56,577 --> 00:27:57,837
[SPEAKER_10]: Swedish stock.

405
00:27:58,417 --> 00:27:59,697
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, Swedish stock.

406
00:28:00,277 --> 00:28:01,558
[SPEAKER_13]: A Swedish bank account.

407
00:28:02,358 --> 00:28:02,878
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

408
00:28:07,358 --> 00:28:07,778
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll go back.

409
00:28:07,838 --> 00:28:08,239
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll go back.

410
00:28:08,379 --> 00:28:09,460
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll go back.

411
00:28:34,957 --> 00:28:42,962
[SPEAKER_11]: Last week went to Bodega Bay and there was about seven of us friends and we took a trip.

412
00:28:43,002 --> 00:28:45,204
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a yearly trip that we always go to Bodega Bay.

413
00:28:45,264 --> 00:28:50,227
[SPEAKER_11]: Ran out of house out there and stay, what is it, four days, three nights.

414
00:28:50,647 --> 00:28:51,127
[SPEAKER_11]: Really fun.

415
00:28:51,628 --> 00:29:00,393
[SPEAKER_11]: House is right on the ocean and so we just kick it there for, you know, the four days, three nights and drink up and party.

416
00:29:02,615 --> 00:29:09,137
[SPEAKER_13]: It's almost like that movie we saw, where they went to the cabin and partied.

417
00:29:09,397 --> 00:29:10,678
[SPEAKER_13]: You guys are a party animal.

418
00:29:11,058 --> 00:29:11,878
[SPEAKER_13]: Cabin fever.

419
00:29:11,918 --> 00:29:14,179
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, we went and saw Cabin Fever two days ago.

420
00:29:15,059 --> 00:29:17,860
[SPEAKER_13]: Most disturbing film I think I've ever seen.

421
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:19,140
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't get disturbed by movies.

422
00:29:20,501 --> 00:29:21,861
[SPEAKER_13]: I know, I'm not going to talk too much about it.

423
00:29:22,521 --> 00:29:22,741
[SPEAKER_13]: What?

424
00:29:23,081 --> 00:29:23,682
[SPEAKER_13]: What's his aunt?

425
00:29:23,702 --> 00:29:24,982
[SPEAKER_13]: It's the most disturbing film.

426
00:29:26,337 --> 00:29:29,719
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, I'm sorry, second most disturbing film I've seen next to that.

427
00:29:29,759 --> 00:29:32,901
[SPEAKER_13]: That Ichi the Killer that Loki was talking about last week.

428
00:29:33,321 --> 00:29:35,403
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm sorry, that's too much.

429
00:29:35,483 --> 00:29:39,385
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, if there's a line, that movie crossed it.

430
00:29:39,685 --> 00:29:43,628
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know, we saw 28 Days Later yesterday and that was pretty disturbing too.

431
00:29:43,688 --> 00:29:45,069
[SPEAKER_13]: I like 28 Days Later though.

432
00:29:45,089 --> 00:29:45,969
[SPEAKER_11]: 28 Days Later was a good movie.

433
00:29:45,989 --> 00:29:47,210
[SPEAKER_13]: By the way, it was a good movie, thanks.

434
00:29:47,230 --> 00:29:49,631
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no, no, no, no, no.

435
00:29:50,012 --> 00:29:51,733
[SPEAKER_06]: The most disturbing movie ever.

436
00:29:53,252 --> 00:29:55,574
[SPEAKER_06]: is freaking Manos the Hands of Fate.

437
00:29:57,796 --> 00:29:58,236
[SPEAKER_13]: You know what?

438
00:29:58,997 --> 00:30:01,759
[SPEAKER_13]: Even Suicide Circle, Battle Royale, not disturbing.

439
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:05,943
[SPEAKER_13]: Suicide Circle, a little strange, but not disturbing.

440
00:30:07,904 --> 00:30:14,730
[SPEAKER_06]: It's creepy and thought-provoking, but not really disturbing unless you happen to have fixations about, you know, flesh.

441
00:30:15,331 --> 00:30:15,391
No.

442
00:30:16,664 --> 00:30:17,905
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, there's Captain Fury for you.

443
00:30:17,945 --> 00:30:20,808
[SPEAKER_11]: A lot of flesh-tearing... Yeah, it was nasty.

444
00:30:21,188 --> 00:30:21,869
[SPEAKER_11]: It was pretty gruesome.

445
00:30:21,889 --> 00:30:23,791
[SPEAKER_13]: Tim Curry in Legend, disturbing.

446
00:30:24,331 --> 00:30:25,352
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I'll agree with that.

447
00:30:25,372 --> 00:30:26,073
[SPEAKER_13]: But so great.

448
00:30:27,654 --> 00:30:29,316
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyway, sorry to interrupt.

449
00:30:29,876 --> 00:30:31,838
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyway, what else?

450
00:30:31,938 --> 00:30:33,019
[SPEAKER_11]: So that was that.

451
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:33,980
[SPEAKER_11]: That was a cool trip.

452
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:39,605
[SPEAKER_11]: Came back, didn't want to go back home, and that's why I took a day vacation.

453
00:30:39,645 --> 00:30:42,148
[SPEAKER_11]: Before my vacation and a day vacation after my vacation.

454
00:30:42,748 --> 00:30:43,989
[SPEAKER_13]: That's the way to do it.

455
00:30:44,149 --> 00:30:45,790
[SPEAKER_13]: Nobody ever wants to go back to work after vacation.

456
00:31:11,365 --> 00:31:12,846
[SPEAKER_10]: How are you talking about I don't work?

457
00:31:12,866 --> 00:31:13,866
[SPEAKER_10]: But you're back in school.

458
00:31:14,406 --> 00:31:15,747
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I'm going to be working.

459
00:31:16,027 --> 00:31:16,367
[SPEAKER_13]: Where?

460
00:31:16,987 --> 00:31:17,668
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know yet.

461
00:31:17,788 --> 00:31:19,188
[SPEAKER_10]: I still have to go out this weekend.

462
00:31:19,288 --> 00:31:20,029
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh.

463
00:31:20,329 --> 00:31:22,810
[SPEAKER_13]: But, like, right now, right this second, you're not working?

464
00:31:23,230 --> 00:31:23,390
[SPEAKER_10]: No.

465
00:31:23,870 --> 00:31:25,651
[SPEAKER_10]: But I am still employed at Golfland.

466
00:31:26,011 --> 00:31:27,572
[SPEAKER_10]: I am still on payroll at Golfland.

467
00:31:29,713 --> 00:31:30,053
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

468
00:31:30,233 --> 00:31:30,813
[SPEAKER_13]: My bad.

469
00:31:31,193 --> 00:31:33,494
[SPEAKER_10]: And then you get to, later on, I'll deal with the whole thing.

470
00:31:33,595 --> 00:31:36,716
[SPEAKER_13]: And how you enjoy your job working at a Golfland, I'll never know.

471
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:42,244
[SPEAKER_13]: It's not Roseville, especially after what happened to you this summer, which I want to talk about later.

472
00:31:42,284 --> 00:31:43,545
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, I will talk about that later.

473
00:31:43,886 --> 00:31:48,730
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's not Roseville and there's not hundreds of thousands of snotty shithead kids to deal with.

474
00:31:49,531 --> 00:31:50,392
[SPEAKER_13]: And no water slides.

475
00:31:52,594 --> 00:31:54,896
[SPEAKER_13]: For the love of God, do not bring up each of the killer mid-show.

476
00:31:55,237 --> 00:31:56,458
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh no, please don't.

477
00:31:59,614 --> 00:32:00,575
[SPEAKER_11]: All I need... Yeah.

478
00:32:00,895 --> 00:32:03,096
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'll have to say yes, I do love my job.

479
00:32:03,136 --> 00:32:11,201
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, I've been there for over nine years now, so... And I don't see myself going anywhere anytime soon, so... To be honest, I actually like my job a lot.

480
00:32:11,241 --> 00:32:15,664
[SPEAKER_13]: Like, four months ago, before I was promoted, I'd be complaining about it a lot.

481
00:32:15,684 --> 00:32:16,585
[SPEAKER_13]: But right now, love it.

482
00:32:17,185 --> 00:32:17,565
[SPEAKER_13]: I really do.

483
00:32:18,906 --> 00:32:20,667
[SPEAKER_11]: Looking forward to a fat pay increase.

484
00:32:21,848 --> 00:32:23,789
[SPEAKER_07]: Mine's busy now that peak season's almost over.

485
00:32:23,809 --> 00:32:26,451
[SPEAKER_07]: All you college students just need to hurry up and get in school and stop calling.

486
00:32:31,095 --> 00:32:34,798
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't really say that because I've talked to so many neat and cool people.

487
00:32:35,238 --> 00:32:39,502
[SPEAKER_07]: Your typical college student is smarter than your typical mortgage person.

488
00:32:40,162 --> 00:32:41,023
[SPEAKER_07]: Typical homeowner.

489
00:32:41,483 --> 00:32:41,984
[SPEAKER_11]: Really?

490
00:32:43,525 --> 00:32:44,526
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's go there.

491
00:32:44,746 --> 00:32:45,527
[SPEAKER_11]: Typical.

492
00:32:46,828 --> 00:32:48,109
[SPEAKER_11]: I, for one, am a homeowner.

493
00:32:49,944 --> 00:32:56,286
[SPEAKER_07]: I used to work in mortgage customer service and you have no idea how many people I had to explain how to read their loan documents.

494
00:32:56,406 --> 00:32:57,066
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not funny.

495
00:32:57,346 --> 00:32:58,427
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, it's, yeah.

496
00:32:58,747 --> 00:33:00,027
[SPEAKER_11]: I would say they are kind of complicated.

497
00:33:00,107 --> 00:33:01,788
[SPEAKER_07]: The smart people are the ones who don't call.

498
00:33:01,808 --> 00:33:06,450
[SPEAKER_07]: I've seen people who sign with an X.

499
00:33:09,371 --> 00:33:11,272
[SPEAKER_11]: Signing with an X, that's pretty bad

500
00:33:37,809 --> 00:33:38,930
[SPEAKER_07]: 42 people at a time.

501
00:33:39,390 --> 00:33:44,933
[SPEAKER_07]: Put these nice pretty shiny collars on them and give them all a weapon and have them kill each other off in three days.

502
00:33:44,973 --> 00:33:45,693
[SPEAKER_11]: Electroshock.

503
00:33:46,454 --> 00:33:47,414
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh no, Battle Royale.

504
00:33:47,874 --> 00:33:49,255
Have you seen Battle Royale?

505
00:33:49,695 --> 00:33:51,136
[SPEAKER_13]: No, I have not seen Battle Royale yet.

506
00:33:54,198 --> 00:33:54,578
[SPEAKER_07]: That's it.

507
00:33:54,638 --> 00:33:56,919
[SPEAKER_11]: Next time... Are you going to de-virginize me?

508
00:33:57,699 --> 00:34:05,664
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to bring... I'm going to bring over the DVD and have you watch it sometime.

509
00:34:08,889 --> 00:34:09,990
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, Battle Royale real fast.

510
00:34:10,050 --> 00:34:13,811
[SPEAKER_13]: In case we have any new listeners, we'll run down the Battle Royale spiel again real fast.

511
00:34:13,831 --> 00:34:16,792
[SPEAKER_13]: In case we have any new listeners, because we're constantly bringing up Battle Royale on the show.

512
00:34:17,113 --> 00:34:17,713
[SPEAKER_13]: Battle Royale.

513
00:34:18,213 --> 00:34:19,874
[SPEAKER_13]: Japanese movie put out what?

514
00:34:20,194 --> 00:34:19,874
99?

515
00:34:20,474 --> 00:34:22,655
[SPEAKER_13]: 94.

516
00:34:20,494 --> 00:34:22,655
[SPEAKER_13]: Put out 94.

517
00:34:22,935 --> 00:34:24,656
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, I don't think it's that old, dear.

518
00:34:26,116 --> 00:34:26,296
[SPEAKER_13]: Is it?

519
00:34:26,497 --> 00:34:27,337
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, whenever it was put out.

520
00:34:28,717 --> 00:34:29,538
[SPEAKER_13]: It's 2000, okay.

521
00:34:30,558 --> 00:34:32,379
[SPEAKER_13]: Regardless, it's not that old, is the point.

522
00:34:32,479 --> 00:34:46,328
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's not that old, and they put a bunch of students on an island, and when we say students, we're talking like 7th and 8th grade kids, 9th grade kids, and it's some kind of government program where they basically say, you guys have to kill each other, and the last one standing gets to go home.

523
00:34:47,288 --> 00:34:53,472
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's really violent, because, you know, it's not an American movie, so they're not subject to all the, you know, R rating stuff.

524
00:34:54,373 --> 00:34:56,694
[SPEAKER_06]: It had a theatrical release in Europe.

525
00:34:57,498 --> 00:34:58,439
[SPEAKER_13]: See, but the Brit is joking.

526
00:34:58,459 --> 00:35:00,420
[SPEAKER_13]: You can show tit on TV in Britain and no one cares.

527
00:35:00,941 --> 00:35:07,086
[SPEAKER_13]: But basically it's really violent and kids kill each other and it's great because kids get really annoying.

528
00:35:07,666 --> 00:35:08,307
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not censored.

529
00:35:08,347 --> 00:35:09,148
[SPEAKER_11]: There's no censorship.

530
00:35:09,708 --> 00:35:10,329
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, hell no.

531
00:35:14,011 --> 00:35:17,014
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, I mean, yeah, there's censorship in Japan, but the movie's not censored.

532
00:35:17,454 --> 00:35:21,017
[SPEAKER_13]: They're not going to show nudity when it's about seven and eight year olds.

533
00:35:21,157 --> 00:35:22,338
[SPEAKER_13]: Gratuitous violence, yes.

534
00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:23,679
[SPEAKER_13]: Nudity, no.

535
00:35:23,819 --> 00:35:24,120
[SPEAKER_13]: Gotcha.

536
00:35:25,154 --> 00:35:26,135
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm sorry, 7th and 8th graders.

537
00:35:26,195 --> 00:35:27,395
[SPEAKER_13]: I said 7th and 8th year olds, didn't I?

538
00:35:27,675 --> 00:35:28,116
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, you did.

539
00:35:31,477 --> 00:35:33,178
[SPEAKER_13]: I like picturing them as junior high school kids.

540
00:35:33,478 --> 00:35:34,539
[SPEAKER_13]: Don't ruin my fantasy.

541
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:37,120
[SPEAKER_13]: You're sick.

542
00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:38,301
[SPEAKER_13]: 9th grade is high school here.

543
00:35:38,401 --> 00:35:39,301
[SPEAKER_13]: You're a sick man.

544
00:35:39,721 --> 00:35:40,302
[SPEAKER_13]: You know what?

545
00:35:41,442 --> 00:35:43,083
[SPEAKER_13]: Playing DDR as long as I have.

546
00:35:44,824 --> 00:35:46,205
[SPEAKER_13]: You get to hate kids real fast.

547
00:35:49,406 --> 00:35:50,027
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyway, hi.

548
00:35:50,427 --> 00:35:51,187
[SPEAKER_11]: I love those things.

549
00:35:51,747 --> 00:35:52,228
[SPEAKER_13]: Anything else?

550
00:35:52,268 --> 00:35:53,888
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, don't encourage them.

551
00:35:53,989 --> 00:35:54,589
[SPEAKER_13]: Don't encourage them.

552
00:35:57,441 --> 00:35:57,742
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what?

553
00:35:57,782 --> 00:35:58,542
[SPEAKER_11]: I still love this thing.

554
00:36:00,224 --> 00:36:03,968
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, yeah, baby.

555
00:36:04,389 --> 00:36:06,952
[SPEAKER_13]: I think I was bringing him all of a sudden.

556
00:36:07,472 --> 00:36:08,193
[SPEAKER_11]: Didn't you have to take a nap?

557
00:36:08,353 --> 00:36:10,275
[SPEAKER_11]: Actually, I am quite tired.

558
00:36:10,295 --> 00:36:11,497
[SPEAKER_11]: I've been driving all goddamn day.

559
00:36:12,662 --> 00:36:13,602
[SPEAKER_07]: Rob, you're on a timeout.

560
00:36:13,642 --> 00:36:14,122
[SPEAKER_07]: Go in the room.

561
00:36:14,282 --> 00:36:15,263
[SPEAKER_07]: Ooh!

562
00:36:15,283 --> 00:36:16,043
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh-oh.

563
00:36:16,283 --> 00:36:18,463
[SPEAKER_07]: I have the microphone!

564
00:36:19,143 --> 00:36:19,623
[SPEAKER_07]: You are cool.

565
00:36:19,643 --> 00:36:20,323
[SPEAKER_07]: You like the ferret.

566
00:36:22,524 --> 00:36:23,244
[SPEAKER_11]: He just sneezed.

567
00:36:23,284 --> 00:36:24,444
[SPEAKER_11]: I can't believe he just sneezed.

568
00:36:24,784 --> 00:36:28,585
[SPEAKER_07]: Rob is making the give me hand, trying to take the microphone away from me.

569
00:36:29,365 --> 00:36:30,245
[SPEAKER_07]: No, and look at me.

570
00:36:30,305 --> 00:36:31,005
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm on the floor.

571
00:36:31,346 --> 00:36:32,306
[SPEAKER_11]: Give me chair.

572
00:36:32,326 --> 00:36:33,306
[SPEAKER_11]: He's pouting.

573
00:36:33,346 --> 00:36:34,086
[SPEAKER_11]: Look at that lip.

574
00:36:34,266 --> 00:36:34,866
[SPEAKER_11]: My goodness.

575
00:36:36,607 --> 00:36:37,447
[SPEAKER_06]: Rob's being cute.

576
00:36:37,487 --> 00:36:38,367
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, I have to give it back.

577
00:36:39,696 --> 00:36:40,196
[SPEAKER_11]: I win!

578
00:36:43,198 --> 00:36:45,339
[SPEAKER_11]: He got present with a ferret, and that was funny.

579
00:36:45,439 --> 00:36:46,720
[SPEAKER_11]: That was a flying ferret, though.

580
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:51,162
[SPEAKER_11]: Those are... are... Special.

581
00:36:51,962 --> 00:36:52,463
[SPEAKER_11]: Special!

582
00:36:52,603 --> 00:36:56,405
[SPEAKER_13]: I thought... One of these was, like, long gone, and we couldn't find it.

583
00:36:56,625 --> 00:36:56,905
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyway.

584
00:36:57,745 --> 00:36:58,105
[SPEAKER_13]: It's right here.

585
00:36:59,326 --> 00:37:00,627
[SPEAKER_03]: Goodie.

586
00:37:01,367 --> 00:37:02,608
[SPEAKER_11]: Anything else you'd like to share about your week?

587
00:37:02,628 --> 00:37:03,188
[SPEAKER_11]: He's getting cold.

588
00:37:04,429 --> 00:37:05,009
[SPEAKER_11]: Ah, let me think.

589
00:37:05,509 --> 00:37:05,649
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

590
00:37:06,850 --> 00:37:06,990
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

591
00:37:07,010 --> 00:37:07,090
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

592
00:37:08,968 --> 00:37:11,069
[SPEAKER_13]: Uh, you want me to go or you want to go, Matt?

593
00:37:12,649 --> 00:37:13,129
[SPEAKER_13]: I can go.

594
00:37:13,550 --> 00:37:14,690
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, my week and my day.

595
00:37:15,310 --> 00:37:16,751
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, well, my week is pretty cool.

596
00:37:16,811 --> 00:37:17,811
[SPEAKER_13]: I've had a great weekend.

597
00:37:17,831 --> 00:37:19,932
[SPEAKER_13]: I've had a really, like, long weekend, which is good.

598
00:37:20,192 --> 00:37:24,793
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, God, Friday night, uh, went over to Joey's and we watched a movie.

599
00:37:25,553 --> 00:37:30,015
[SPEAKER_13]: And, um, Saturday we went to Matt's birthday thingy at QSAR.

600
00:37:30,055 --> 00:37:30,355
[SPEAKER_13]: SAR.

601
00:37:31,255 --> 00:37:31,776
[SPEAKER_13]: Q-Stars

602
00:37:50,070 --> 00:37:51,951
[SPEAKER_13]: It's, it's, whatever, it just happens.

603
00:37:53,891 --> 00:37:56,472
[SPEAKER_13]: Joey said that he likes to go to the beach.

604
00:37:56,512 --> 00:37:59,513
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'm like, I haven't been to the beach in like a couple years.

605
00:37:59,573 --> 00:38:00,753
[SPEAKER_13]: So Joey was like, let's go today.

606
00:38:01,553 --> 00:38:02,213
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm like, okay.

607
00:38:02,633 --> 00:38:03,734
[SPEAKER_13]: So we went to the beach today.

608
00:38:03,794 --> 00:38:05,334
[SPEAKER_13]: We went over to Stinson Beach.

609
00:38:05,534 --> 00:38:07,375
[SPEAKER_11]: Stinson Beach over on Highway 1.

610
00:38:07,475 --> 00:38:10,315
[SPEAKER_11]: Which is right just north of San Francisco.

611
00:38:10,475 --> 00:38:13,556
[SPEAKER_13]: And you have to take the most windiest road to get there.

612
00:38:13,756 --> 00:38:14,856
[SPEAKER_13]: It's so fun to drive.

613
00:38:15,737 --> 00:38:16,817
[SPEAKER_13]: Luckily I didn't have to drive.

614
00:38:18,994 --> 00:38:20,554
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, I was having fun.

615
00:38:20,894 --> 00:38:22,815
[SPEAKER_13]: He was holding on to the goddamn door.

616
00:38:22,835 --> 00:38:24,855
[SPEAKER_11]: I was not holding on to the goddamn door.

617
00:38:25,735 --> 00:38:27,976
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you master the inertia drift while driving?

618
00:38:28,716 --> 00:38:29,656
[SPEAKER_11]: The inertia drift.

619
00:38:29,916 --> 00:38:32,137
[SPEAKER_13]: You have to remember he hasn't played Initial D yet.

620
00:38:32,657 --> 00:38:32,977
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

621
00:38:33,857 --> 00:38:34,257
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

622
00:38:35,978 --> 00:38:37,318
[SPEAKER_13]: Initial D is a racing game.

623
00:38:38,158 --> 00:38:39,178
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, I love racing games.

624
00:38:40,319 --> 00:38:41,199
[SPEAKER_13]: I love racing games.

625
00:38:41,239 --> 00:38:42,859
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll bring Initial D over next Sunday then.

626
00:38:42,899 --> 00:38:43,379
[SPEAKER_13]: Cool.

627
00:38:43,799 --> 00:38:45,440
[SPEAKER_13]: I said it last week and I'll say it this week.

628
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:46,420
[SPEAKER_13]: F, Initial D.

629
00:38:47,543 --> 00:38:49,044
[SPEAKER_13]: F-Zero's where it's at.

630
00:38:49,924 --> 00:38:50,984
[SPEAKER_13]: F-Zero's much better.

631
00:38:53,285 --> 00:38:54,166
[SPEAKER_13]: I know, I knew I would.

632
00:38:54,386 --> 00:38:54,766
[SPEAKER_13]: It's okay.

633
00:38:56,286 --> 00:38:56,947
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, okay.

634
00:38:57,367 --> 00:39:01,508
[SPEAKER_13]: So, uh, the Windy Roads, we went to the beach and the beach was fun.

635
00:39:01,548 --> 00:39:05,810
[SPEAKER_13]: We took about a gazillion pictures and there's, uh... Yeah, we did take a lot of pictures.

636
00:39:05,870 --> 00:39:10,492
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you for taking all sorts of, like, disgusting pictures of me trying to climb the rock.

637
00:39:10,752 --> 00:39:13,493
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, you guys will love this.

638
00:39:14,273 --> 00:39:16,154
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you for watching!

639
00:39:35,046 --> 00:39:35,807
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

640
00:39:57,762 --> 00:39:58,603
[SPEAKER_11]: And he can't pass them.

641
00:39:58,623 --> 00:40:01,244
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, like five miles the whole trip.

642
00:40:01,724 --> 00:40:03,586
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm like, there's passing lanes.

643
00:40:04,446 --> 00:40:05,387
[SPEAKER_11]: Turnouts, use them.

644
00:40:06,227 --> 00:40:07,728
[SPEAKER_13]: So we got stuck behind them.

645
00:40:07,748 --> 00:40:10,690
[SPEAKER_11]: Grandmas or grandpas listening out there, you know, turnouts, use them.

646
00:40:11,470 --> 00:40:19,915
[SPEAKER_13]: And not only did that slow us up, but then when we got to Vacaville or whatever that was, not Vacaville, Fairfield, there was all the traffic.

647
00:40:21,356 --> 00:40:23,818
[SPEAKER_11]: If it had not been for that traffic... It was only a fender bender, too.

648
00:40:24,795 --> 00:40:26,877
[SPEAKER_13]: It would not have been for that accident, we would have been here on time.

649
00:40:26,957 --> 00:40:31,120
[SPEAKER_13]: So for all those of you that get in car accidents, stop it and learn how to drive.

650
00:40:33,042 --> 00:40:41,569
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what's actually interesting is that a lot of the time it's not rubberneck drivers that cause the traffic to slow down.

651
00:40:42,170 --> 00:40:42,630
[SPEAKER_10]: Really?

652
00:40:42,831 --> 00:40:47,715
[SPEAKER_10]: Often the highway patrol actually sends out units to create traffic brakes.

653
00:40:50,006 --> 00:40:54,188
[SPEAKER_10]: It happened a couple days ago when I was on my way back from Ikea.

654
00:40:54,469 --> 00:40:56,169
[SPEAKER_11]: They probably do that on major accidents, right?

655
00:40:56,590 --> 00:41:03,373
[SPEAKER_12]: Actually, no, as I was going down 580 heading home from Ikea, there was a... I guess it was just like a...

656
00:41:04,648 --> 00:41:16,733
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a minor two-car accident on the right-hand shoulder right near a freeway entrance, and then two highway patrolmen busted ahead of traffic and created a traffic break.

657
00:41:16,793 --> 00:41:25,537
[SPEAKER_10]: It actually slowed down everyone to about 15 miles an hour as they passed the accident site, then pulled off the road and let everyone go.

658
00:41:25,597 --> 00:41:28,998
[SPEAKER_11]: Which makes sense, so the cleanup crew and everything can take care of it.

659
00:41:29,238 --> 00:41:31,580
[SPEAKER_13]: I've seen that happen twice in Sacramento, actually.

660
00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:33,522
[SPEAKER_13]: Same intersection, same time of day.

661
00:41:33,762 --> 00:41:40,727
[SPEAKER_13]: Like, we were coming back from the club, downtown, on the highway, coming back from downtown, same intersection, Fulton and 80.

662
00:41:41,208 --> 00:41:42,409
[SPEAKER_13]: I've seen two huge wrecks there.

663
00:41:42,429 --> 00:41:51,356
[SPEAKER_13]: And the policemen, they drive across all the lanes of traffic, and they do it really slow to pace the rest of the traffic, because you can't get by them, and you don't want to pass a cop anyway.

664
00:41:52,377 --> 00:41:53,658
[SPEAKER_13]: And he's driving across all the lanes of traffic.

665
00:41:53,938 --> 00:41:56,020
[SPEAKER_13]: That would be a great racing game.

666
00:41:57,868 --> 00:41:58,929
[SPEAKER_17]: Thanks, Car Driver.

667
00:41:58,949 --> 00:42:03,292
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh my God, that would be beautiful.

668
00:42:04,112 --> 00:42:05,013
[SPEAKER_13]: You can do it to your own beat.

669
00:42:08,140 --> 00:42:08,620
[SPEAKER_11]: That's funny.

670
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:09,981
[SPEAKER_11]: VidPower is like, speed limit?

671
00:42:10,001 --> 00:42:10,502
[SPEAKER_11]: What's that?

672
00:42:12,603 --> 00:42:25,173
[SPEAKER_11]: Something that is posted on the highway that you're supposed to follow, but you notice that on the highways, it'll say maximum speed of 65 miles an hour.

673
00:42:25,333 --> 00:42:25,553
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

674
00:42:26,193 --> 00:42:28,855
[SPEAKER_11]: But in the city, it has just speed limit, 35.

675
00:42:29,396 --> 00:42:29,816
[SPEAKER_11]: Speed limit, 40.

676
00:42:29,856 --> 00:42:31,417
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's not the max.

677
00:42:31,457 --> 00:42:35,560
[SPEAKER_11]: You can go 65 out of 40, but it's just not the maximum speed limit, you know?

678
00:42:36,341 --> 00:42:37,442
[SPEAKER_11]: Have you ever told that to a cop?

679
00:42:38,772 --> 00:42:39,453
[SPEAKER_11]: Actually, no.

680
00:42:40,294 --> 00:42:42,256
[SPEAKER_04]: What about where they have maximum and minimums?

681
00:42:42,356 --> 00:42:45,098
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd love for them to go after people who are not going the minimum.

682
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:49,242
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, they pull over people going, you know, 50 into 65.

683
00:42:49,302 --> 00:42:49,743
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, come on.

684
00:42:51,395 --> 00:42:53,276
[SPEAKER_13]: Joey and I were talking about this on the drive home today, too.

685
00:42:53,696 --> 00:42:58,197
[SPEAKER_13]: We decided that there needs to be a lane just for special people like us.

686
00:42:58,717 --> 00:42:59,657
[SPEAKER_11]: Screw the special people.

687
00:42:59,697 --> 00:43:00,678
[SPEAKER_11]: It should be Joey's lane.

688
00:43:00,698 --> 00:43:01,038
[SPEAKER_11]: Hello.

689
00:43:01,698 --> 00:43:04,619
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, I don't have to deal with these idiot morons that don't know how to drive.

690
00:43:04,759 --> 00:43:05,479
[SPEAKER_13]: You know what?

691
00:43:05,499 --> 00:43:09,000
[SPEAKER_13]: How about a lane that you have to pass an IQ test to be able to drive in?

692
00:43:10,589 --> 00:43:11,490
[SPEAKER_13]: Like, here's the test.

693
00:43:11,510 --> 00:43:12,031
[SPEAKER_13]: You know what?

694
00:43:12,231 --> 00:43:14,213
[SPEAKER_13]: The higher the IQ, the stupider they get.

695
00:43:14,253 --> 00:43:14,973
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't get it.

696
00:43:15,094 --> 00:43:25,184
[SPEAKER_13]: When you see an accident on the side of the road, do you A, stop to help, B, slow down to look at dead bodies, C, drive faster?

697
00:43:25,264 --> 00:43:25,904
[SPEAKER_13]: Go faster.

698
00:43:26,285 --> 00:43:29,308
[SPEAKER_13]: If you answered C, you get to drive in the special lane.

699
00:43:29,468 --> 00:43:29,968
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, there you go.

700
00:43:32,150 --> 00:43:35,491
[SPEAKER_12]: Of course, you could just have, like, flying cars so you don't have to deal with highways.

701
00:43:36,332 --> 00:43:37,352
[SPEAKER_12]: That would be so much simpler.

702
00:43:37,632 --> 00:43:39,313
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, you know what... Thank you, George Jetson.

703
00:43:41,374 --> 00:43:47,237
[SPEAKER_11]: Being the profession that I am in, if I see something like that, I would have to actually call CHP to make sure somebody's on the way.

704
00:43:49,137 --> 00:43:50,478
[SPEAKER_13]: Aww, you're a good Samaritan.

705
00:43:50,538 --> 00:43:51,218
[SPEAKER_11]: I wouldn't stop and help.

706
00:43:51,238 --> 00:43:53,659
[SPEAKER_11]: You can do it from your cell phone while you're driving, cut a mouse faster.

707
00:43:53,699 --> 00:43:54,680
[SPEAKER_11]: I would have to call CHP.

708
00:43:57,301 --> 00:43:57,781
[SPEAKER_11]: That's just me.

709
00:44:01,203 --> 00:44:01,443
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

710
00:44:03,034 --> 00:44:08,038
[SPEAKER_13]: I think that's all I want to say, because we'll talk about QSAR later, I'm sure Loki might get into it or whatever.

711
00:44:08,098 --> 00:44:11,721
[SPEAKER_13]: We need to take a break before we talk about that, but Loki, do you want to talk about your week, your day?

712
00:44:12,882 --> 00:44:16,244
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, sure, why not, you know, since I'm just sitting here.

713
00:44:17,185 --> 00:44:24,871
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, let's see, this week wasn't all that important, you know, it wasn't like I had my birthday or anything, and, uh, yeah, I'm 23.

714
00:44:25,231 --> 00:44:24,871
23?

715
00:44:26,212 --> 00:44:27,813
[SPEAKER_14]: No one died except for John Reeder.

716
00:44:27,973 --> 00:44:28,614
[SPEAKER_14]: I clean.

717
00:44:28,794 --> 00:44:29,854
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, my goodness.

718
00:44:31,479 --> 00:44:32,684
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, but I didn't kill Giant Cash.

719
00:44:32,844 --> 00:44:33,788
[SPEAKER_13]: John Ritter, though, was me.

720
00:44:34,470 --> 00:44:35,574
[SPEAKER_11]: There you go.

721
00:44:36,578 --> 00:44:37,060
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, man.

722
00:44:38,186 --> 00:44:40,508
[SPEAKER_13]: Johnny Cash, he had one foot in the grave anyway.

723
00:44:40,568 --> 00:44:41,768
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, when his wife died.

724
00:44:42,369 --> 00:44:45,411
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, hey, you know, I was really depressed.

725
00:44:45,751 --> 00:44:47,492
[SPEAKER_07]: And I normally don't get depressed for famous people.

726
00:44:48,053 --> 00:44:48,773
[SPEAKER_13]: Don't get me wrong.

727
00:44:48,873 --> 00:44:50,914
[SPEAKER_13]: Johnny Cash, great man, talented man.

728
00:44:51,515 --> 00:44:53,436
[SPEAKER_13]: But his wife died four months ago.

729
00:44:53,776 --> 00:44:55,718
[SPEAKER_13]: He's been having all sorts of problems anyway.

730
00:44:55,798 --> 00:44:57,819
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, bless him for trying to keep going on.

731
00:44:57,899 --> 00:45:00,241
[SPEAKER_13]: But it's the same thing happened with my grandma and my grandpa.

732
00:45:00,261 --> 00:45:01,001
[SPEAKER_13]: It's just too hard.

733
00:45:01,021 --> 00:45:02,102
[SPEAKER_13]: Your spouse goes, you're next.

734
00:45:02,162 --> 00:45:03,503
[SPEAKER_13]: You get sick often.

735
00:45:04,083 --> 00:45:06,885
[SPEAKER_07]: This is what happened with my aunt.

736
00:45:07,409 --> 00:45:12,194
[SPEAKER_07]: When her father died, her mother passed within six hours of him.

737
00:45:13,075 --> 00:45:13,996
[SPEAKER_07]: And she was in perfect health.

738
00:45:15,198 --> 00:45:19,543
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I guess, you know, I'm glad that they're all, you know, united again.

739
00:45:19,583 --> 00:45:20,584
[SPEAKER_07]: But it was very depressing.

740
00:45:20,604 --> 00:45:21,044
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, I'm sorry.

741
00:45:21,084 --> 00:45:21,565
[SPEAKER_07]: Happy birthday.

742
00:45:22,306 --> 00:45:27,511
[SPEAKER_14]: So what you're saying is Johnny Cash was so distraught over the fact that John Ritter died that he too...

743
00:45:30,201 --> 00:45:31,001
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know about that.

744
00:45:31,782 --> 00:45:32,202
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't know.

745
00:45:32,442 --> 00:45:35,883
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, um, so yeah, I didn't do too much this week.

746
00:45:36,223 --> 00:45:38,744
[SPEAKER_14]: I took two days off, so I had a four day weekend.

747
00:45:39,464 --> 00:45:47,167
[SPEAKER_14]: And, um, Thursday I went and got my breaks done, took it over to the mechanic that happens to be just like a few feet from our door.

748
00:45:48,027 --> 00:45:49,687
[SPEAKER_14]: Like literally right over the fence.

749
00:45:50,128 --> 00:45:50,628
[SPEAKER_14]: And, um...

750
00:45:51,548 --> 00:46:00,015
[SPEAKER_14]: So I took it over there, and I found out that, you know, I got my brakes done, it didn't need to really be done, but I went ahead and did the back brakes, because it was kind of a birthday gift for my mom.

751
00:46:00,555 --> 00:46:08,501
[SPEAKER_14]: But, um, so, found out that, like, Speedy Oil Change lied about, you know, my brakes needing to be done, they just wanted more service for me.

752
00:46:08,521 --> 00:46:15,647
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what, I have, that, just Speedy in general, or any kind of those quickie lubes, don't go.

753
00:46:16,894 --> 00:46:17,675
[SPEAKER_11]: That's all I have to say.

754
00:46:17,695 --> 00:46:19,496
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, and they broke my axle.

755
00:46:19,616 --> 00:46:19,856
[SPEAKER_14]: See?

756
00:46:19,916 --> 00:46:20,696
[SPEAKER_14]: Hello?

757
00:46:20,736 --> 00:46:24,699
[SPEAKER_14]: They damaged my axle so that I'd have to come back and have it replaced there too.

758
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:30,403
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, I can't prove that they did break it, but I think they broke it a little bit more.

759
00:46:30,723 --> 00:46:42,250
[SPEAKER_14]: Because right after I got my tune up there, my car started grinding when I turned right, which is from my right front axle going out.

760
00:46:42,891 --> 00:46:46,073
[SPEAKER_14]: But that's not going to cost that much to replace, so that's cool.

761
00:46:48,069 --> 00:46:49,529
[SPEAKER_14]: and they're working my pads some more.

762
00:46:49,769 --> 00:46:51,150
[SPEAKER_14]: I have them all framed now.

763
00:46:51,290 --> 00:46:51,950
[SPEAKER_14]: They're all pretty.

764
00:46:52,830 --> 00:46:56,391
[SPEAKER_14]: And... Yes, they're sitting on the patio.

765
00:46:56,811 --> 00:47:06,973
[SPEAKER_14]: And yesterday, or no, Friday, I went and bought a TV, a 27-inch TV that I'll be using in my cabinet.

766
00:47:07,553 --> 00:47:13,214
[SPEAKER_14]: And let me just say that was the most entertaining thing to watch for anyone else that was out there in that parking lot.

767
00:47:13,494 --> 00:47:14,734
[SPEAKER_14]: Me trying to get that in my car.

768
00:47:16,084 --> 00:47:36,591
[SPEAKER_14]: It wouldn't fit in the back door, it wouldn't fit in the trunk, so I ended up having to break the box open, cram the TV into the front seat, pad it with the phone that was inside there, strap the seatbelt around it, and hope to God that when I turn corners that it doesn't crush me when it rolls, so that was fun.

769
00:47:37,111 --> 00:47:42,433
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, and then getting it in the door as the neighbors are standing there watching me go, oh, it's so heavy!

770
00:47:44,167 --> 00:48:09,576
[SPEAKER_14]: and then, um, so I did that, and then, um, what else, um, oh yeah, then yesterday we went and played QZAR and I kicked ass and won every game, as usual, and there's some guy there that called me fat, and I laughed at him, that was so great, Boki's like, that guy called me fat, and it was the guy that worked there, and

771
00:48:11,471 --> 00:48:21,415
[SPEAKER_14]: He was just pissed off that I was beating up on him But we ended up tying and we shook hands at the end That's all what it's about, you know, just talking What are you talking about?

772
00:48:21,555 --> 00:48:38,461
[SPEAKER_14]: Cues are, that's what you do, you talk That's gay You talk shit all the time and at the very end, you know, you just thank them for a good game Because that's what it is Because the next game, you know, they could be whooping up on you And the game after that, you could be whooping on them You never know, it's just a different situation each time, so What?

773
00:48:39,802 --> 00:48:44,465
[SPEAKER_07]: I just don't talk to anybody and then I sneak up on them and poke my gun in their back and then fire and run away giggling.

774
00:48:45,866 --> 00:48:58,493
[SPEAKER_14]: Well then we started doing genius stuff because the arena isn't built that well so the red headquarters, they didn't paint it too well and so we were tagging the headquarters from outside the headquarters because the plexiglass wasn't covered all the way.

775
00:48:58,613 --> 00:48:59,013
[SPEAKER_13]: Lame.

776
00:48:59,273 --> 00:49:02,915
[SPEAKER_11]: Let me just say, being on the team that was defeated by you, lame.

777
00:49:02,935 --> 00:49:04,556
[SPEAKER_11]: Cheat.

778
00:49:04,596 --> 00:49:05,076
[SPEAKER_11]: Cheat.

779
00:49:06,397 --> 00:49:08,919
[SPEAKER_14]: We're bouncing shots off the windows and stuff like that.

780
00:49:08,999 --> 00:49:11,661
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll be on the other side of the arena, see the lights on the windows.

781
00:49:12,822 --> 00:49:13,563
[SPEAKER_13]: Great stuff.

782
00:49:13,963 --> 00:49:14,704
[SPEAKER_13]: So we did that.

783
00:49:14,744 --> 00:49:15,324
[SPEAKER_13]: We had fun.

784
00:49:15,364 --> 00:49:16,405
[SPEAKER_13]: Played some Cusar.

785
00:49:16,445 --> 00:49:20,789
[SPEAKER_13]: Dropped some business cards off there.

786
00:49:20,849 --> 00:49:24,292
[SPEAKER_14]: So hopefully someone picked them up as listening to the show tonight, even though I don't think so.

787
00:49:24,372 --> 00:49:26,894
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's it.

788
00:49:26,934 --> 00:49:28,475
[SPEAKER_14]: And there was no Hicks there.

789
00:49:28,875 --> 00:49:29,536
[SPEAKER_14]: I was surprised.

790
00:49:29,716 --> 00:49:30,477
[SPEAKER_14]: No Hicks at all.

791
00:49:30,597 --> 00:49:33,079
[SPEAKER_14]: It was like they knew we were coming and fled.

792
00:49:34,761 --> 00:49:34,881
[SPEAKER_13]: Uh oh.

793
00:50:06,458 --> 00:50:12,925
[SPEAKER_03]: uh oh I missed all that anyways moving on yeah

794
00:50:19,424 --> 00:50:39,385
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh well, anyways, um, so then later on, um, yeah, we left, and then, um, I came back here and I was exhausted, and today I bought everything to convert all of our game systems over to S-Video, and I bought a bunch of, I raped Radio Shack's, um, little component cabinet, and I took all their, um, um,

795
00:50:40,686 --> 00:50:43,228
[SPEAKER_14]: I want to talk a little more about QZAR when we come back.

796
00:50:43,268 --> 00:50:43,668
[SPEAKER_14]: Not now.

797
00:51:07,165 --> 00:51:08,126
[SPEAKER_13]: Because it's time for a break.

798
00:51:08,146 --> 00:51:10,690
[SPEAKER_13]: We've been talking for like 40 minutes straight here, so we're going to take a break.

799
00:51:11,050 --> 00:51:11,270
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

800
00:51:11,491 --> 00:51:11,711
[SPEAKER_13]: Fine.

801
00:51:11,771 --> 00:51:12,312
[SPEAKER_13]: Because I said so.

802
00:51:13,073 --> 00:51:13,633
[SPEAKER_13]: And I want to stretch.

803
00:51:13,814 --> 00:51:16,417
[SPEAKER_13]: So, we will be right back.

804
00:51:16,717 --> 00:51:18,139
[SPEAKER_13]: You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

805
00:51:18,179 --> 00:51:18,520
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

806
00:52:39,461 --> 00:52:40,546
Thanks for watching!

807
00:53:30,860 --> 00:53:32,382
Thanks for watching!

808
00:54:45,658 --> 00:55:04,916
[SPEAKER_16]: In the far real, you've gotta learn how to survive Cause you never know where it's your turn to take a dive So you go, you stay with your eyes in the back of your head You never know if you'll be alive or be dead

809
00:55:08,007 --> 00:55:08,968
[SPEAKER_16]: Thanks for watching!

810
00:55:48,482 --> 00:55:49,743
[SPEAKER_13]: Orange Lounge Radio.

811
00:55:50,063 --> 00:55:52,224
[SPEAKER_13]: We put your thing down, flip it, and reverse it.

812
00:55:53,065 --> 00:55:59,709
[SPEAKER_13]: Hey, we're back.

813
00:56:00,389 --> 00:56:01,029
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, everybody.

814
00:56:02,810 --> 00:56:04,051
[SPEAKER_07]: Yay, I'm in the chair.

815
00:56:05,272 --> 00:56:09,154
[SPEAKER_07]: I did it all by myself.

816
00:56:09,174 --> 00:56:10,235
[SPEAKER_06]: I have the ferret, too.

817
00:56:11,595 --> 00:56:12,336
[SPEAKER_06]: So what are we going to do?

818
00:56:12,356 --> 00:56:13,216
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know.

819
00:56:13,576 --> 00:56:14,217
[SPEAKER_06]: Give the microphone a rub.

820
00:56:14,676 --> 00:56:18,917
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, I want, because somebody in the chat room was asking over break, what is QSAR?

821
00:56:19,617 --> 00:56:34,580
[SPEAKER_13]: Actually, the place is QZAR, and it's with a Z, and it's laser tag, but the reason why we've been calling it QSAR tonight is because on our little receipts yesterday when we bought the games, it said QSAR, and we were joking, QSAR, you know, shit like that.

822
00:56:36,861 --> 00:56:38,341
[SPEAKER_13]: But, what?

823
00:56:39,261 --> 00:56:40,842
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, British was Quasar, wasn't it?

824
00:56:40,882 --> 00:56:41,782
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you call Quasar in Britain?

825
00:56:41,802 --> 00:56:41,882
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

826
00:56:44,662 --> 00:56:46,263
[SPEAKER_13]: Jimmy's like, I'm not that big a dork, okay?

827
00:56:48,223 --> 00:56:49,283
[SPEAKER_13]: But I actually, you know what?

828
00:56:49,763 --> 00:56:56,405
[SPEAKER_13]: I was talking about how much I suck at QZAR, and Loki told me I had to shut up, because I actually did pretty good.

829
00:56:56,505 --> 00:56:58,345
[SPEAKER_13]: One game I came in second, just behind Loki.

830
00:56:58,545 --> 00:56:59,065
[SPEAKER_13]: I was happy.

831
00:57:00,125 --> 00:57:08,007
[SPEAKER_13]: It was a solo game, too, because I just stood by the headquarters, and every time Loki would shoot enough people that he could go for the headquarters, I'd be there to jump out and shoot him.

832
00:57:09,335 --> 00:57:12,877
[SPEAKER_14]: I got the headquarters like three times, or almost three times.

833
00:57:12,937 --> 00:57:16,258
[SPEAKER_14]: I got it twice, and then I got tagged by Ryan at the very end.

834
00:57:17,859 --> 00:57:24,722
[SPEAKER_14]: I was tagged, and the light was up, because Black Lab was trying to shoot it even... What?

835
00:57:25,102 --> 00:57:26,683
[SPEAKER_13]: This chat needs to be scrolled down, sorry.

836
00:57:27,183 --> 00:57:27,843
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh.

837
00:57:33,766 --> 00:57:34,726
[SPEAKER_13]: Sorry to interrupt your story.

838
00:57:34,786 --> 00:57:35,167
[SPEAKER_13]: Keep going.

839
00:57:35,667 --> 00:57:35,927
[SPEAKER_13]: My bad.

840
00:57:38,052 --> 00:57:52,217
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, anyways, um, so yeah, I was gonna tag him the second time, but Puppy didn't understand, I guess, the concept of, um, Super Charge, where you have to tag five people without getting tagged, and your gun goes into rapid fire, then you can tag the headquarters, that's the only way you can tag it.

841
00:57:52,437 --> 00:58:07,223
[SPEAKER_14]: So he's standing there blocking me, because I'm trying to, like, tag the headquarters, and here he's standing there, had I remembered that you can tag it from the outside, you know, that would've saved me a whole lot more time, but, you know, um, so no, I had to, like, you know, kind of

842
00:58:08,328 --> 00:58:09,810
[SPEAKER_14]: Get tagged a few times, but then I won.

843
00:58:10,590 --> 00:58:10,810
[SPEAKER_14]: Again.

844
00:58:12,292 --> 00:58:27,786
[SPEAKER_14]: But, um, what was it, um, there was like some, like, tubby little kid there that was, um, you know, talking crap, and I beat him down, and then, then I was playing DDR later on, and he's like, oh my god, you're good at QZR and DDR!

845
00:58:30,004 --> 00:58:57,534
[SPEAKER_13]: I was not there, that's funny Yeah, even I would have made fun of that That's cool See, it wasn't as bad as Skater Cowboy Oh my god, Skater Cowboy is awful Skater Cowboy was there last night, I would have laughed We always think about Skater Cowboy when we think of Vacaville I wasn't even there Seriously, every time I go to Vacaville, I look for Skater Cowboy But I don't think we'll ever meet him again

846
00:58:58,598 --> 00:59:00,499
[SPEAKER_13]: He's just rolling in the wind.

847
00:59:01,719 --> 00:59:07,841
[SPEAKER_13]: With his cool custom made DDR Freak skateboard that sucked.

848
00:59:08,741 --> 00:59:12,402
[SPEAKER_13]: Jamie, do you know if DDR Freak has any officially licensed skateboarding products?

849
00:59:12,962 --> 00:59:13,502
[SPEAKER_07]: Hell no.

850
00:59:14,563 --> 00:59:15,183
[SPEAKER_13]: Just checking.

851
00:59:17,784 --> 00:59:21,765
[SPEAKER_07]: I think the only official DDR Freak product there is are like the shirts and then that's it.

852
00:59:23,120 --> 00:59:24,161
[SPEAKER_13]: I thought there were stickers, too.

853
00:59:24,601 --> 00:59:25,121
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe stickers.

854
00:59:25,141 --> 00:59:25,361
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe.

855
00:59:25,421 --> 00:59:29,143
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, this one was a hand-carved skateboard.

856
00:59:29,864 --> 00:59:30,884
[SPEAKER_14]: That was so awful.

857
00:59:31,064 --> 00:59:32,245
[SPEAKER_13]: When you're a freak, you're a freak.

858
00:59:34,106 --> 00:59:35,186
[SPEAKER_14]: What's a syringe?

859
00:59:37,928 --> 00:59:42,310
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, I... I just hadn't been to play in so long.

860
00:59:42,370 --> 00:59:43,571
[SPEAKER_13]: It's just like I kind of forgot...

861
00:59:45,453 --> 00:59:46,054
[SPEAKER_13]: What it was like.

862
00:59:46,074 --> 00:59:48,796
[SPEAKER_13]: But those energizers kind of sucked for me.

863
00:59:48,856 --> 00:59:50,878
[SPEAKER_13]: Like, I could never get my gun to energize right.

864
00:59:51,158 --> 00:59:55,361
[SPEAKER_13]: And I don't know if it was just that I would keep shaking my gun in front of it when you have to hold it.

865
00:59:55,422 --> 00:59:57,363
[SPEAKER_13]: But even when I held it, it wouldn't do anything.

866
00:59:58,304 --> 00:59:58,804
[SPEAKER_13]: It was stupid.

867
00:59:59,125 --> 00:59:59,585
[SPEAKER_13]: I didn't like that.

868
01:00:00,266 --> 01:00:01,266
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, I am very impatient.

869
01:00:02,407 --> 01:00:06,311
[SPEAKER_13]: But it sucks we have to go all the way to Vacaville to play QZAR because Laser Force is unacceptable.

870
01:00:06,771 --> 01:00:07,732
[SPEAKER_13]: That's not a laser tag.

871
01:00:07,812 --> 01:00:10,494
[SPEAKER_13]: It still exists?

872
01:00:10,534 --> 01:00:11,956
[SPEAKER_13]: Believe it or not, we just drove by it the other day.

873
01:00:11,976 --> 01:00:13,417
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm like, why is that place still open?

874
01:00:15,126 --> 01:00:16,007
[SPEAKER_13]: It smells like pee.

875
01:00:16,027 --> 01:00:20,450
[SPEAKER_13]: You have to understand because they're the number one Laser Force play since Cusar left.

876
01:00:20,630 --> 01:00:21,671
[SPEAKER_14]: They were about to go under.

877
01:00:21,691 --> 01:00:23,233
[SPEAKER_14]: They're the only Laser Force.

878
01:00:23,973 --> 01:00:27,616
[SPEAKER_14]: Imagine, well, Laser X is a count, but imagine if we will.

879
01:00:27,836 --> 01:00:31,339
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, Sunsplash is about on the same level as Laser Force.

880
01:00:31,359 --> 01:00:35,983
[SPEAKER_14]: We're talking like, you know, Laser Force was in the quicksand.

881
01:00:36,713 --> 01:00:48,282
[SPEAKER_14]: Goin' Under, No Chance of Survival Whatsoever No Chance to Survive, Make Your Time Yeah, then all of a sudden, you know, Q's are leaves, and Gas for Air, and it's like, barely alive

882
01:00:49,144 --> 01:00:50,766
[SPEAKER_14]: And it comes back with a vengeance.

883
01:00:50,806 --> 01:00:54,951
[SPEAKER_13]: The only thing I like about Laser Force is I love the two-story arena concept.

884
01:00:55,051 --> 01:00:57,333
[SPEAKER_13]: I love... Because you know I love to play sniper.

885
01:00:57,734 --> 01:01:00,757
[SPEAKER_13]: So I love to sit there on the top and pelt people at the bottom.

886
01:01:01,358 --> 01:01:02,940
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, I'm a camper and I'm proud of it.

887
01:01:03,761 --> 01:01:07,605
[SPEAKER_14]: I wish we could go play QZAR in Ireland because their Irish rules rock.

888
01:01:08,366 --> 01:01:09,947
[SPEAKER_13]: Irish Rules... Can you club people with a gun?

889
01:01:10,228 --> 01:01:11,909
[SPEAKER_13]: Can you drink and then play Cusar?

890
01:01:12,429 --> 01:01:15,992
[SPEAKER_13]: Irish Rules, there's no neck strap, and there's running.

891
01:01:16,152 --> 01:01:20,455
[SPEAKER_14]: Their arenas are huge, and it's like running around in a huge... It's pretty much like playing paintball.

892
01:01:21,376 --> 01:01:26,180
[SPEAKER_14]: Because it's just that... It's just crazy, and it's the most tiring thing ever.

893
01:01:26,200 --> 01:01:34,666
[SPEAKER_14]: We played Irish Rules one time when I was there on Tuesday night at that Cusar in Vacaville, and that was very dangerous, and...

894
01:01:36,665 --> 01:01:37,926
[SPEAKER_13]: Whoa, what a liability.

895
01:01:38,006 --> 01:01:39,947
[SPEAKER_13]: How did you get away with doing Irish rules there?

896
01:01:40,387 --> 01:01:42,568
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, gee, because they don't have any waiver cards.

897
01:01:42,668 --> 01:01:43,848
[SPEAKER_13]: It doesn't matter anyways.

898
01:01:44,389 --> 01:01:47,990
[SPEAKER_14]: That QZAR's run so poorly, it's just... It's a joke.

899
01:01:48,050 --> 01:01:53,132
[SPEAKER_14]: If anyone got hurt at all, like stubbed a toe or whatever, you could just go and sue that place and it wouldn't matter.

900
01:01:53,653 --> 01:01:54,833
[SPEAKER_14]: Hey, kids!

901
01:01:55,193 --> 01:01:56,394
[SPEAKER_14]: Hey, kids, wanna make money?

902
01:01:57,834 --> 01:02:03,657
[SPEAKER_14]: Seriously, there's no waiver forms at all, so... I mean, you could...

903
01:02:04,924 --> 01:02:10,709
[SPEAKER_13]: I should do that so I can pay my college fees.

904
01:02:23,976 --> 01:02:25,897
[SPEAKER_13]: The show just kind of came to a screeching halt.

905
01:02:26,558 --> 01:02:32,640
[SPEAKER_13]: Sorry, I just saw that my Beat Mania Complete Mix 2 was done.

906
01:02:32,781 --> 01:02:33,721
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, aren't you special.

907
01:02:34,101 --> 01:02:35,262
[SPEAKER_13]: You want to do the cage match now, Jamie?

908
01:02:36,362 --> 01:02:37,363
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I want to do the cage match.

909
01:02:37,403 --> 01:02:39,164
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, let me get over there and I'll set up a cage match.

910
01:02:39,184 --> 01:02:40,224
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

911
01:02:40,284 --> 01:02:42,005
[SPEAKER_07]: Here, Loki, talk.

912
01:02:44,011 --> 01:02:52,814
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, today, or actually not today, a few days ago, they finally released the hard drive image of Beat Me A Complete Mix 2.

913
01:02:54,174 --> 01:02:55,134
[SPEAKER_14]: And that was pretty cool.

914
01:02:57,215 --> 01:02:57,875
[SPEAKER_14]: Bad puppy.

915
01:02:58,976 --> 01:02:59,776
[SPEAKER_14]: Bad puppy.

916
01:03:00,556 --> 01:03:05,818
[SPEAKER_14]: So anyways, yeah, I just downloaded it, all 47 parts of it, and now it's going to unzip.

917
01:03:07,098 --> 01:03:07,898
[SPEAKER_14]: Very slowly.

918
01:03:08,639 --> 01:03:09,419
[SPEAKER_14]: It's going to take a while.

919
01:03:12,518 --> 01:03:14,339
[SPEAKER_14]: So, yeah.

920
01:03:15,380 --> 01:03:17,761
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, I put more posters up today.

921
01:03:18,241 --> 01:03:23,004
[SPEAKER_14]: I put the Excel Saga is Yummy, and I put the, uh, Anime Pinup Babes.

922
01:03:26,226 --> 01:03:26,446
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

923
01:03:29,568 --> 01:03:36,512
[SPEAKER_14]: But then the Anime Pinup Babes, I wanted to get the one, they have a few other, like, babes on that poster, I wanted to get a different poster with them on it.

924
01:03:38,187 --> 01:03:41,308
[SPEAKER_07]: To make this room complete, you need a Transformers poster, so I'm going to have to get you one.

925
01:03:41,908 --> 01:03:43,349
[SPEAKER_11]: Hell yeah.

926
01:03:43,369 --> 01:03:43,489
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

927
01:03:46,030 --> 01:03:48,450
[SPEAKER_11]: But, um... I still have some, actually.

928
01:03:49,911 --> 01:03:50,291
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, okay.

929
01:03:50,791 --> 01:03:52,132
[SPEAKER_11]: We're talking about Transformers.

930
01:03:52,892 --> 01:03:54,452
[SPEAKER_11]: And, uh... Transformers.

931
01:03:54,572 --> 01:03:56,613
[SPEAKER_11]: I still have some, actually, back in the day.

932
01:03:59,154 --> 01:03:59,274
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh...

933
01:04:04,535 --> 01:04:11,917
[SPEAKER_07]: A big announcement, go to your local GameStop and reserve your Season 3 Transformers box set now so you can be cool like me.

934
01:04:13,417 --> 01:04:14,617
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I have mine reserved.

935
01:04:14,677 --> 01:04:15,357
[SPEAKER_07]: That's awesome.

936
01:04:15,417 --> 01:04:16,978
[SPEAKER_07]: Season 3 is the best season ever.

937
01:04:17,478 --> 01:04:18,558
[SPEAKER_10]: So awesome.

938
01:04:19,818 --> 01:04:22,499
[SPEAKER_10]: We all aspire to be as cool as Jamie, don't we?

939
01:04:22,919 --> 01:04:25,239
[SPEAKER_07]: Everybody in the world needs to be as cool as me.

940
01:04:25,859 --> 01:04:29,880
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what, I just met Jamie and Jamie is the coolest chick I've ever met, so hey.

941
01:04:31,178 --> 01:04:32,800
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I'm cool.

942
01:04:32,820 --> 01:04:33,620
[SPEAKER_07]: I have a spirit.

943
01:04:36,543 --> 01:04:40,567
[SPEAKER_07]: I sent you a RAR file, 0preshow.rar.

944
01:04:44,090 --> 01:04:48,294
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I was cool and decided to upload it so I didn't have to waste any more CDs.

945
01:04:53,098 --> 01:04:54,980
[SPEAKER_07]: I endorse WinRAR, not WinZip.

946
01:04:56,381 --> 01:04:56,781
[SPEAKER_07]: I have it.

947
01:04:57,062 --> 01:04:57,242
[SPEAKER_07]: Here.

948
01:05:03,737 --> 01:05:08,262
[SPEAKER_13]: Hello, that music means it's time for a cage match.

949
01:05:08,542 --> 01:05:12,105
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm wrapping Loki up in court, it's fun.

950
01:05:12,145 --> 01:05:17,631
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyway, the way the cage match works, if you win the white, you can't vote for Holic, that's the first rule.

951
01:05:19,052 --> 01:05:26,600
[SPEAKER_13]: Second rule, if you want to vote in the cage match, you have to get in our chat room, www.tallybomani.com, click on Orange Lounge and click on chat, this is the way it works.

952
01:05:27,100 --> 01:05:32,944
[SPEAKER_13]: Each of the three lovely hosts of this program, including myself, DarkSakura, and Loki, bring one song to the table.

953
01:05:33,745 --> 01:05:38,969
[SPEAKER_13]: And you guys vote on your favorite song, and that song goes into rotation all week long on Orange Lounge Radio.

954
01:05:39,349 --> 01:05:43,232
[SPEAKER_13]: However, if a song wins for a month straight, it gets taken out.

955
01:05:44,533 --> 01:05:45,354
[SPEAKER_13]: And guess what?

956
01:05:46,895 --> 01:05:47,896
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm a little scared.

957
01:05:49,770 --> 01:05:53,611
[SPEAKER_13]: And last week's song that won is now halfway there.

958
01:05:54,152 --> 01:05:57,853
[SPEAKER_13]: Last week's winner was Loki's song that he picked two weeks ago, but it's still winning.

959
01:05:58,453 --> 01:06:04,195
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's Every Little Thing from the Cybertrans album with Face the Change.

960
01:06:04,995 --> 01:06:08,336
[SPEAKER_13]: And this is the Above and Beyond and Dirt Devils remix.

961
01:06:09,477 --> 01:06:13,478
[SPEAKER_13]: So you only get a clip of it because it won last week, but this is song number one you can vote for tonight.

962
01:06:13,618 --> 01:06:15,219
[SPEAKER_13]: Every Little Thing with Face the Changes.

963
01:06:15,879 --> 01:06:16,219
[SPEAKER_13]: Here you go.

964
01:06:53,378 --> 01:06:54,159
Thank you for watching!

965
01:07:20,251 --> 01:07:21,272
Thank you for watching.

966
01:07:21,312 --> 01:07:22,332
See you next time.

967
01:07:59,096 --> 01:07:59,916
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, hi.

968
01:07:59,936 --> 01:08:01,837
[SPEAKER_13]: That was last week's winner.

969
01:08:01,957 --> 01:08:02,838
[SPEAKER_13]: Two weeks running now.

970
01:08:02,918 --> 01:08:05,879
[SPEAKER_13]: Every little thing on the Cybertrans album will face the change.

971
01:08:07,239 --> 01:08:10,041
[SPEAKER_13]: Next up, Jamie, you want to do yours next or you want me to do mine?

972
01:08:10,481 --> 01:08:11,901
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to do yours?

973
01:08:12,362 --> 01:08:15,343
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

974
01:08:15,863 --> 01:08:17,944
[SPEAKER_07]: Mine is one of the Overclocked remixes.

975
01:08:18,004 --> 01:08:20,425
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't remember who did it or what it's called, but it's from Ryden.

976
01:08:21,457 --> 01:08:23,819
[SPEAKER_07]: which is one of the best shooting games ever.

977
01:08:24,099 --> 01:08:27,082
[SPEAKER_13]: I can fill you in on the rest of it because I can read it right off the mp3 here.

978
01:08:27,482 --> 01:08:30,344
[SPEAKER_13]: It's Gallantry, Nobility of Spirit.

979
01:08:31,365 --> 01:08:31,925
[SPEAKER_13]: That's what it says.

980
01:08:32,326 --> 01:08:35,568
[SPEAKER_07]: And if you have never played Raiden, go play Raiden DX because it's the best of the series.

981
01:08:36,069 --> 01:08:36,389
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

982
01:08:36,789 --> 01:08:38,251
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, so here's Jamie's pick.

983
01:08:38,491 --> 01:08:41,453
[SPEAKER_13]: It's Ryza with Raiden Gallantry.

984
01:08:41,873 --> 01:08:42,154
[SPEAKER_13]: Enjoy.

985
01:10:00,676 --> 01:10:01,500
Thanks for watching!

986
01:10:39,003 --> 01:10:39,625
Thanks for watching!

987
01:13:39,811 --> 01:13:40,712
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, we're back.

988
01:13:40,752 --> 01:13:43,313
[SPEAKER_13]: That was Ryza with Raiden Gallantry.

989
01:13:43,333 --> 01:13:54,361
[SPEAKER_13]: That was DarkSakura's pick for the cage match this week, and now we get to tear it apart or praise it lots, whatever you want to do.

990
01:13:54,381 --> 01:13:57,883
[SPEAKER_07]: It was a really good remix, and the song that I initially picked had already been played.

991
01:13:58,644 --> 01:14:02,067
[SPEAKER_07]: because I didn't notice the track listing, I just went, oh, this is from Wipeout, and put it in.

992
01:14:02,908 --> 01:14:03,708
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't even listen to it.

993
01:14:05,990 --> 01:14:17,480
[SPEAKER_07]: So, this one, this one, I liked it, it's a good remix, and it's a great game, you know, I've always been a big fan of the Raiden series, and figured a lot of people don't appreciate it that much, so I threw it in, so it gets an 8 for me.

994
01:14:19,782 --> 01:14:20,323
[SPEAKER_13]: Uh, Loki.

995
01:14:22,284 --> 01:14:25,147
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, it was okay, but it was,

996
01:14:28,032 --> 01:14:39,390
[SPEAKER_14]: I give it an 8 also because it wasn't a speed mix and it wasn't annoying.

997
01:14:42,526 --> 01:14:44,087
[SPEAKER_13]: I pretty much agree with Loki.

998
01:14:44,247 --> 01:14:47,110
[SPEAKER_13]: It was good, but it was kind of easy to tune out.

999
01:14:47,310 --> 01:14:50,332
[SPEAKER_13]: But it's good video game music, so I'll give it that.

1000
01:14:50,692 --> 01:14:52,754
[SPEAKER_13]: And Raiden is an underrated shooter, so I'll give you that too.

1001
01:14:53,134 --> 01:14:56,797
[SPEAKER_13]: But as a song itself, I can't see giving it much more than a 6.66.

1002
01:15:08,168 --> 01:15:09,268
[SPEAKER_13]: I forgot to listen to it.

1003
01:15:31,155 --> 01:15:32,336
[SPEAKER_10]: Somebody else take a mic here.

1004
01:15:32,756 --> 01:15:33,837
[SPEAKER_10]: Look at this loser.

1005
01:15:34,217 --> 01:15:34,977
[SPEAKER_12]: Look at this guy.

1006
01:15:34,997 --> 01:15:36,478
[SPEAKER_10]: He's so stupid.

1007
01:15:37,038 --> 01:15:38,039
[SPEAKER_13]: Stupid guy.

1008
01:15:38,059 --> 01:15:39,019
[SPEAKER_12]: What the hell?

1009
01:15:39,420 --> 01:15:41,081
[SPEAKER_13]: What are you doing?

1010
01:15:41,661 --> 01:15:42,001
[SPEAKER_13]: Damn it.

1011
01:15:42,341 --> 01:15:42,761
[SPEAKER_13]: What am I?

1012
01:15:42,922 --> 01:15:48,985
[SPEAKER_13]: I feel like a mobster from Dick Tracy or something with his cord wrapping around me.

1013
01:15:49,265 --> 01:15:51,446
[SPEAKER_13]: He ain't going nowhere until you spill.

1014
01:15:51,987 --> 01:15:52,587
[SPEAKER_13]: Spill.

1015
01:15:52,867 --> 01:15:53,207
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh.

1016
01:15:54,668 --> 01:15:56,649
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I think... Oh.

1017
01:15:57,270 --> 01:15:57,530
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

1018
01:15:57,790 --> 01:15:58,190
[SPEAKER_10]: Switching!

1019
01:16:00,632 --> 01:16:00,912
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

1020
01:16:03,193 --> 01:16:04,054
[SPEAKER_13]: You dropped it!

1021
01:16:04,454 --> 01:16:06,655
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, but you stepped on the cord when you threw it.

1022
01:16:07,336 --> 01:16:08,737
[SPEAKER_13]: Hi, Cage Match, remember me?

1023
01:16:08,917 --> 01:16:09,377
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, yeah!

1024
01:16:10,738 --> 01:16:19,503
[SPEAKER_10]: Um... Yeah, the song was... It was okay, but... I was kind of falling asleep to it, almost.

1025
01:16:20,284 --> 01:16:23,986
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, if I wanted to fall asleep to the music, that'd be good, but I...

1026
01:16:25,160 --> 01:16:25,980
[SPEAKER_10]: I'd give it about a 7.

1027
01:16:26,160 --> 01:16:32,402
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think that's it.

1028
01:16:33,762 --> 01:16:41,684
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd like to take this moment to tell all of you people to learn how to pay attention.

1029
01:16:42,124 --> 01:16:49,926
[SPEAKER_14]: I'd like to mention that the Race Space R6 MK3 is the most gay racing chair I've ever seen.

1030
01:16:51,006 --> 01:16:53,787
[SPEAKER_14]: I can vouch for Loki, he does have ADHD.

1031
01:16:54,895 --> 01:16:57,036
[SPEAKER_13]: Hi, I'd like to finish Cage Venture, thank you.

1032
01:16:57,116 --> 01:16:58,637
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't too, but I never took anything.

1033
01:16:59,218 --> 01:16:59,518
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright.

1034
01:16:59,858 --> 01:17:00,618
[SPEAKER_06]: That would explain it.

1035
01:17:01,799 --> 01:17:02,279
[SPEAKER_06]: Take this.

1036
01:17:02,880 --> 01:17:04,881
[SPEAKER_13]: My turn, my song's turn.

1037
01:17:06,142 --> 01:17:11,905
[SPEAKER_13]: Actually, I didn't really have time this weekend to really pick a song I really wanted to do or anything.

1038
01:17:12,386 --> 01:17:14,467
[SPEAKER_13]: So, usually there's like...

1039
01:17:15,669 --> 01:17:20,412
[SPEAKER_13]: I get sent like five songs a week from our chat room going, you should use this song, you should use this song.

1040
01:17:21,093 --> 01:17:28,538
[SPEAKER_13]: And, you know, I obviously don't have time to fit them all in, but I'm going to go ahead and do this one the angel sent me, because it's pretty good, I like it.

1041
01:17:29,258 --> 01:17:30,659
[SPEAKER_13]: So, what the hell.

1042
01:17:31,159 --> 01:17:33,461
[SPEAKER_13]: Here it is, this is Froggy with Coming to My Dream.

1043
01:17:33,481 --> 01:17:35,823
[SPEAKER_13]: I actually like this song, so I'm okay with picking this.

1044
01:17:35,843 --> 01:17:36,343
[SPEAKER_13]: So here we go.

1045
01:17:37,103 --> 01:17:37,604
[SPEAKER_13]: This is my pick.

1046
01:18:16,399 --> 01:18:18,039
Thank you for watching!

1047
01:20:28,019 --> 01:20:37,783
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm into my dream Let me show you where I've been It's you and me I've seen Let me tell you what I mean In the deep blue sky

1048
01:20:58,462 --> 01:20:59,543
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for watching!

1049
01:22:11,024 --> 01:22:13,586
[SPEAKER_13]: Hello, that was Froggy with Coming to My Dream.

1050
01:22:13,626 --> 01:22:13,906
[SPEAKER_13]: Jamie?

1051
01:22:14,786 --> 01:22:22,651
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, it wasn't bad, but it sounded very, I guess, cookie cutter, you know?

1052
01:22:23,532 --> 01:22:28,615
[SPEAKER_07]: The little pauses where it did the little vroom vroom noise were kind of cool before it set up again.

1053
01:22:29,316 --> 01:22:33,238
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's not anything that I could really latch onto and concentrate on.

1054
01:22:33,879 --> 01:22:36,781
[SPEAKER_07]: So it gets about a 7, yeah.

1055
01:22:36,801 --> 01:22:38,081
[SPEAKER_07]: 7 points.

1056
01:22:39,062 --> 01:22:39,702
[SPEAKER_13]: Alrighty.

1057
01:22:40,023 --> 01:22:40,283
[SPEAKER_14]: Loki!

1058
01:22:43,740 --> 01:22:46,282
[SPEAKER_14]: I've heard that song so many times, it's not even funny.

1059
01:22:48,464 --> 01:22:52,847
[SPEAKER_14]: But it has froggy in it, so I was expecting swimming music, and that's what it was.

1060
01:22:53,348 --> 01:22:54,429
[SPEAKER_14]: Music had me swimming.

1061
01:22:56,070 --> 01:22:57,011
[SPEAKER_14]: Into boredom!

1062
01:23:00,213 --> 01:23:07,819
[SPEAKER_14]: Now, I was kind of tuning that one out, too, because I've heard it so many times, but I was busy, you know, with renaming zip files and stuff.

1063
01:23:08,900 --> 01:23:11,943
[SPEAKER_14]: You and that massive porn book!

1064
01:23:13,922 --> 01:23:15,724
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, but this isn't about the porn collection.

1065
01:23:15,764 --> 01:23:16,925
[SPEAKER_03]: This is about Beatmania.

1066
01:23:17,145 --> 01:23:17,446
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1067
01:23:17,786 --> 01:23:19,227
[SPEAKER_14]: No, it was okay.

1068
01:23:19,367 --> 01:23:20,308
[SPEAKER_14]: It was a pretty good song.

1069
01:23:20,409 --> 01:23:26,655
[SPEAKER_14]: In fact, I think it's better than my song this week, which you should vote out, because I have a better one for next week.

1070
01:23:28,577 --> 01:23:28,857
[SPEAKER_13]: Or not.

1071
01:23:28,877 --> 01:23:30,699
[SPEAKER_13]: Just vote for Loki, since it's the best one.

1072
01:23:32,725 --> 01:23:33,885
[SPEAKER_13]: Chicken Dance, yeah, for Chicken Dance.

1073
01:23:35,426 --> 01:23:37,547
[SPEAKER_13]: Uh, rule number one, can't vote for Holic, sorry.

1074
01:23:39,528 --> 01:23:43,970
[SPEAKER_13]: You can, however, vote for Pixie Dust's hot Kylie Minogue brand underpants, if you want.

1075
01:23:44,070 --> 01:23:44,510
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm just kidding.

1076
01:23:44,750 --> 01:23:45,330
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a joke!

1077
01:23:45,410 --> 01:23:46,671
[SPEAKER_13]: I checked, that wasn't a music.

1078
01:23:46,691 --> 01:23:47,651
[SPEAKER_13]: Chatroom joke, sorry.

1079
01:23:49,672 --> 01:23:50,732
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, yeah, Froggy, anyway.

1080
01:23:51,092 --> 01:23:52,033
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, it's a cool song.

1081
01:23:52,293 --> 01:23:55,714
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a little bit repetitive to me, but aren't most songs like that repetitive?

1082
01:23:56,555 --> 01:23:58,375
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, so I give it a, uh, eight.

1083
01:23:58,555 --> 01:23:59,236
[SPEAKER_13]: I give it an eight.

1084
01:23:59,456 --> 01:24:00,116
[SPEAKER_13]: I give it an eight.

1085
01:24:00,336 --> 01:24:00,936
[SPEAKER_13]: I give it an eight.

1086
01:24:01,136 --> 01:24:01,216
[SPEAKER_13]: Ow!

1087
01:24:03,228 --> 01:24:04,889
[SPEAKER_13]: No, I actually do like that song a lot.

1088
01:24:06,249 --> 01:24:07,249
[SPEAKER_13]: I was about to throw the mic at you.

1089
01:24:08,230 --> 01:24:09,410
[SPEAKER_13]: Did you actually listen to this one?

1090
01:24:12,931 --> 01:24:13,291
[SPEAKER_13]: I give it a 6.5.

1091
01:24:13,371 --> 01:24:21,774
[SPEAKER_13]: It was a little repetitive, but it was alright.

1092
01:24:22,034 --> 01:24:22,354
[SPEAKER_12]: Puppy.

1093
01:24:24,355 --> 01:24:24,775
[SPEAKER_12]: Snore.

1094
01:24:24,795 --> 01:24:24,775
4.

1095
01:24:25,375 --> 01:24:25,696
[SPEAKER_12]: Bradley.

1096
01:24:25,716 --> 01:24:29,077
[SPEAKER_15]: I thought it was pretty good.

1097
01:24:29,097 --> 01:24:29,497
[SPEAKER_10]: I gave it 7.5.

1098
01:24:32,182 --> 01:24:33,463
[SPEAKER_13]: Did you like comment on this one, Joey?

1099
01:24:33,603 --> 01:24:34,344
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, I think I will.

1100
01:24:34,924 --> 01:24:37,846
[SPEAKER_11]: I was listening to that song, and I kind of liked it.

1101
01:24:38,107 --> 01:24:44,912
[SPEAKER_11]: It was slow in the beginning, but it kept... I mean, I haven't heard many, many, many songs like it, but I thought I liked it.

1102
01:24:45,012 --> 01:24:48,194
[SPEAKER_11]: So, I will have to say a seven.

1103
01:24:49,035 --> 01:24:49,335
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

1104
01:24:49,896 --> 01:24:50,296
[SPEAKER_13]: Sounds good.

1105
01:24:50,816 --> 01:24:52,177
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, let's recap, kids.

1106
01:24:52,217 --> 01:24:52,778
[SPEAKER_13]: Here you go.

1107
01:24:52,878 --> 01:24:55,200
[SPEAKER_13]: Send those votes now to Sky.

1108
01:24:55,260 --> 01:24:56,601
[SPEAKER_07]: I just have one more comment on that song.

1109
01:24:56,721 --> 01:24:57,001
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

1110
01:24:57,121 --> 01:24:57,962
[SPEAKER_07]: I memorized the lyrics.

1111
01:25:00,802 --> 01:25:01,883
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm so proud of you.

1112
01:25:06,104 --> 01:25:10,726
[SPEAKER_13]: Some days, I want to beat you over the head with that ferret repeatedly.

1113
01:25:21,351 --> 01:25:22,372
[SPEAKER_13]: Here we go, let's recap.

1114
01:25:22,392 --> 01:25:23,932
[SPEAKER_13]: You can vote for one of these three songs.

1115
01:25:23,972 --> 01:25:28,034
[SPEAKER_13]: Song number one, two weeks running now, Every Little Thing, Cybertrans, Face the Change.

1116
01:25:30,905 --> 01:25:32,526
[SPEAKER_13]: Wow, that's a horrible clip from that song to play.

1117
01:25:32,586 --> 01:25:34,748
[SPEAKER_13]: Let me try a different... That was like an electronic fart.

1118
01:25:34,768 --> 01:25:35,629
[SPEAKER_13]: Let me try a different part.

1119
01:25:41,333 --> 01:25:41,754
[SPEAKER_13]: Good enough.

1120
01:25:41,874 --> 01:25:42,094
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

1121
01:25:42,114 --> 01:25:43,435
[SPEAKER_13]: Tell my words, ghost mix.

1122
01:25:43,775 --> 01:25:47,138
[SPEAKER_13]: Song number two you can vote for, Ryza with Ryden Gallantly.

1123
01:25:56,192 --> 01:25:59,375
[SPEAKER_13]: Song number three you can vote for tonight, Froggy with Come Into My Dream.

1124
01:25:59,715 --> 01:26:01,156
[SPEAKER_13]: Jamie, you remember the lyrics to this one?

1125
01:26:02,437 --> 01:26:02,578
[SPEAKER_13]: Ew.

1126
01:26:03,138 --> 01:26:03,939
[SPEAKER_13]: Never mind, here you go.

1127
01:26:04,239 --> 01:26:05,920
[SPEAKER_05]: Come into my dream, bitches!

1128
01:26:09,103 --> 01:26:10,444
[SPEAKER_13]: That's kind of a shitty clip, too.

1129
01:26:11,805 --> 01:26:12,266
[SPEAKER_13]: Much better.

1130
01:26:12,546 --> 01:26:14,187
[SPEAKER_07]: Right now I feel like Sandstorm.

1131
01:26:17,610 --> 01:26:18,591
[SPEAKER_13]: Rave!

1132
01:26:19,072 --> 01:26:22,595
[SPEAKER_13]: And in great bonsai tradition, place votes now!

1133
01:26:23,564 --> 01:26:24,285
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, bitches.

1134
01:26:25,025 --> 01:26:27,127
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, yeah, Banzai got cancelled.

1135
01:26:27,467 --> 01:26:28,428
[SPEAKER_01]: Did Banzai get cancelled?

1136
01:26:29,088 --> 01:26:29,869
[SPEAKER_13]: It had to have.

1137
01:26:29,909 --> 01:26:30,690
[SPEAKER_01]: It had to have.

1138
01:26:30,710 --> 01:26:31,210
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what?

1139
01:26:31,410 --> 01:26:31,891
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't care.

1140
01:26:35,653 --> 01:26:36,274
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm sorry, puppy.

1141
01:26:36,314 --> 01:26:36,995
[SPEAKER_13]: Nobody can hear you.

1142
01:26:37,015 --> 01:26:40,217
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, is Takeshi's Castle still on?

1143
01:26:40,237 --> 01:26:40,637
[SPEAKER_07]: What was it?

1144
01:26:40,657 --> 01:26:41,838
[SPEAKER_07]: Most Extreme Challenge?

1145
01:26:43,159 --> 01:26:45,141
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, Most Extreme Challenge is still on.

1146
01:26:46,002 --> 01:26:49,745
[SPEAKER_07]: I think I can find, like, original episodes, though, of Takeshi's Castle.

1147
01:26:49,765 --> 01:26:50,745
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to find those.

1148
01:26:51,346 --> 01:26:52,226
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to find those.

1149
01:26:53,522 --> 01:27:01,972
[SPEAKER_10]: Just from some of the clips they take out for the Hacked Up show, there must be some really incredibly stupid people in that show.

1150
01:27:02,973 --> 01:27:07,559
[SPEAKER_10]: My favorite clip is the one time that one chick took a soccer ball into the face.

1151
01:27:07,579 --> 01:27:08,600
[SPEAKER_07]: I like you.

1152
01:27:09,677 --> 01:27:13,600
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I like Japanese variety shows.

1153
01:27:13,740 --> 01:27:15,021
[SPEAKER_07]: I have a tape somewhere in my house.

1154
01:27:15,821 --> 01:27:20,505
[SPEAKER_07]: By the way, this is the first time I had ever seen any Dragon Ball Z. It was taped off of TV in Japan.

1155
01:27:20,965 --> 01:27:22,486
[SPEAKER_07]: I had Macross 7 on the tape.

1156
01:27:22,806 --> 01:27:24,768
[SPEAKER_07]: That's giving you an indication of how old this tape is.

1157
01:27:25,388 --> 01:27:27,410
[SPEAKER_07]: They had this show on a cloud.

1158
01:27:27,650 --> 01:27:28,750
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't remember what it was called.

1159
01:27:28,771 --> 01:27:30,712
[SPEAKER_07]: It was called Uri Nari Land or something.

1160
01:27:31,152 --> 01:27:36,016
[SPEAKER_07]: But they had these interviews and stuff, and then they had dog soccer.

1161
01:27:36,696 --> 01:27:38,358
[SPEAKER_07]: And then they showed a repeat of it.

1162
01:27:38,398 --> 01:27:39,859
[SPEAKER_07]: And then they had sit replay.

1163
01:27:39,879 --> 01:27:40,760
[SPEAKER_07]: The dog like squat down, poop.

1164
01:27:40,820 --> 01:27:42,883
[SPEAKER_07]: And then they had a cow, trying to lead the cow.

1165
01:27:59,681 --> 01:28:01,863
[SPEAKER_14]: I could totally make a Japanese TV.

1166
01:28:02,043 --> 01:28:05,327
[SPEAKER_14]: They just need to let me have, like, no rules whatsoever.

1167
01:28:05,747 --> 01:28:06,868
[SPEAKER_14]: Just let me do it.

1168
01:28:07,049 --> 01:28:08,150
[SPEAKER_07]: Calvin Ball the show.

1169
01:28:09,531 --> 01:28:10,933
[SPEAKER_07]: They need Calvin Ball the show.

1170
01:28:11,533 --> 01:28:12,514
[SPEAKER_14]: Calvin Ball the show.

1171
01:28:12,534 --> 01:28:13,195
[SPEAKER_07]: Calvin and Hobbes.

1172
01:28:13,215 --> 01:28:14,236
[SPEAKER_14]: There is no rules.

1173
01:28:15,237 --> 01:28:19,242
[SPEAKER_07]: But, no, they were trying to get a cowgirl, so then they had a baby dressed up as a soccer ball.

1174
01:28:20,430 --> 01:28:24,491
[SPEAKER_07]: It was wearing this little black and white checked outfit with a little hat that looked like a soccer ball.

1175
01:28:25,251 --> 01:28:29,732
[SPEAKER_06]: And this baby's like, the thing is, this baby was so cute.

1176
01:28:29,932 --> 01:28:33,333
[SPEAKER_07]: Because the baby would just sit there, and then people would wave stuff, and the baby would just laugh at them.

1177
01:28:34,114 --> 01:28:36,034
[SPEAKER_07]: And then go try to wander out of bounds.

1178
01:28:36,694 --> 01:28:41,495
[SPEAKER_07]: And then they were wiggling things, and the baby was going, and started, you know, crawling across.

1179
01:28:41,535 --> 01:28:42,076
[SPEAKER_07]: It was pretty funny.

1180
01:28:42,896 --> 01:28:43,656
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll try to find my tape.

1181
01:28:45,197 --> 01:28:50,378
[SPEAKER_07]: I've also got an interview with Jackie Chan on there, and then I made for a TV movie with him on it, so it was cool.

1182
01:28:50,978 --> 01:28:52,238
[SPEAKER_14]: Jackie Chan rocks.

1183
01:28:52,678 --> 01:28:56,859
[SPEAKER_07]: And I have the best Godzilla movie ever because of the man with the CD player in his head.

1184
01:28:58,419 --> 01:29:00,320
[SPEAKER_07]: Godzilla vs. Mechagidra.

1185
01:29:01,760 --> 01:29:03,400
[SPEAKER_07]: Because the man had a CD player in his head.

1186
01:29:05,521 --> 01:29:05,821
[SPEAKER_17]: Wow.

1187
01:29:07,061 --> 01:29:11,942
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like, he's this android guy, and he's the only one who speaks English in the whole movie, it's great.

1188
01:29:13,012 --> 01:29:14,193
[SPEAKER_07]: Everything he says is in English.

1189
01:29:14,313 --> 01:29:17,955
[SPEAKER_14]: Of course, the freak with the CD player in his head is the only one who speaks English.

1190
01:29:17,975 --> 01:29:19,455
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, he's also not Japanese.

1191
01:29:19,956 --> 01:29:22,557
[SPEAKER_14]: Did he also ask if you could pay for his credit card?

1192
01:29:24,578 --> 01:29:25,318
[SPEAKER_07]: So he speaks English.

1193
01:29:25,839 --> 01:29:30,061
[SPEAKER_13]: He wasn't Japanese, but I bet all the machinery in his head was.

1194
01:29:31,414 --> 01:29:33,155
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm totally ignoring all this chaos.

1195
01:29:33,175 --> 01:29:33,996
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm listening to Yanni.

1196
01:29:53,743 --> 01:29:57,546
[SPEAKER_07]: He's, uh, he's like, oh, I'm like, you know, I saw something else on TV, by the way.

1197
01:29:57,766 --> 01:29:58,327
[SPEAKER_07]: This is cool.

1198
01:29:58,527 --> 01:29:59,327
[SPEAKER_13]: You actually watch TV?

1199
01:29:59,347 --> 01:29:59,988
[SPEAKER_07]: I watch TV.

1200
01:30:00,028 --> 01:30:05,352
[SPEAKER_07]: I was at Julie's house yesterday, and we were, we just happened to watch, um, what were we watching?

1201
01:30:06,052 --> 01:30:08,234
[SPEAKER_07]: We watched the Teen Titans on Cartoon Network.

1202
01:30:09,015 --> 01:30:12,537
[SPEAKER_07]: And it was pretty funny, because, but the intro song was done by Puffy.

1203
01:30:13,758 --> 01:30:14,699
[SPEAKER_13]: Like Puff Daddy?

1204
01:30:14,859 --> 01:30:15,159
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

1205
01:30:15,460 --> 01:30:15,920
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh.

1206
01:30:15,940 --> 01:30:17,721
[SPEAKER_07]: The J-pop group, the girl Puffy.

1207
01:30:18,122 --> 01:30:18,702
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, okay.

1208
01:30:18,722 --> 01:30:20,864
[SPEAKER_07]: I think she got, like, sued by him for using the name.

1209
01:30:22,998 --> 01:30:23,578
[SPEAKER_05]: Fuck him!

1210
01:30:23,818 --> 01:30:24,198
[SPEAKER_07]: I know!

1211
01:30:27,039 --> 01:30:33,340
[SPEAKER_07]: But, um, there was like some drama about it a while back, but the opening song was done by Puffy and it was all in Japanese and it was cute.

1212
01:30:34,280 --> 01:30:36,620
[SPEAKER_13]: You got a Teen Titans looks gay from the chat room.

1213
01:30:37,520 --> 01:30:38,521
[SPEAKER_07]: It was funny!

1214
01:30:39,701 --> 01:30:40,541
[SPEAKER_07]: It was funny!

1215
01:30:40,621 --> 01:30:42,041
[SPEAKER_13]: It was very happy and gay.

1216
01:30:42,681 --> 01:30:52,223
[SPEAKER_07]: No, the guy, it's like, it's done in the style of Batman Beyond, but they do like cutesy manga things, like Beast Boy was doing sweat drops and everything, it was cute.

1217
01:30:55,428 --> 01:30:57,049
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't everybody talk at once!

1218
01:30:57,349 --> 01:30:58,769
[SPEAKER_13]: You guys want to hear who won the cage match?

1219
01:30:59,029 --> 01:30:59,269
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

1220
01:31:00,070 --> 01:31:00,310
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1221
01:31:00,370 --> 01:31:02,431
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, then we'll go to a break, I guess, and then we'll tell you guys.

1222
01:31:02,451 --> 01:31:02,891
[SPEAKER_13]: Who's the winner?

1223
01:31:03,751 --> 01:31:08,713
[SPEAKER_13]: The winner tonight, and I thought we were going to have a tie, but we got one vote in at the last minute that broke the tie.

1224
01:31:09,334 --> 01:31:15,757
[SPEAKER_13]: So, tonight's winner, it was a low voting night, you guys pissed me off, that's right.

1225
01:31:16,537 --> 01:31:18,658
[SPEAKER_13]: Tonight's winner, surprisingly enough, is...

1226
01:31:26,410 --> 01:31:27,952
[SPEAKER_13]: Jamie, you were that close.

1227
01:31:28,012 --> 01:31:32,876
[SPEAKER_13]: Your song just had one vote shy, and Loki, you only got one vote.

1228
01:31:32,976 --> 01:31:34,498
[SPEAKER_13]: So, people are sick of that song, finally.

1229
01:31:34,518 --> 01:31:38,782
[SPEAKER_07]: They got tired of still my words, so it's a more ghost-type planet mix.

1230
01:31:39,703 --> 01:31:41,144
[SPEAKER_07]: And an honorable mention to Holic.

1231
01:31:43,466 --> 01:31:45,807
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you mean that Pixie Dust Underwear didn't get any votes?

1232
01:31:45,827 --> 01:31:47,227
[SPEAKER_13]: Pixie Dust Underwear did not get any votes.

1233
01:31:47,567 --> 01:31:49,127
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh my god, that's a sin.

1234
01:31:49,968 --> 01:31:51,288
[SPEAKER_07]: I vote for you.

1235
01:31:53,228 --> 01:31:56,469
[SPEAKER_13]: I didn't have any voting privileges, so I couldn't vote for the underwear.

1236
01:31:56,489 --> 01:32:05,571
[SPEAKER_13]: I think we collectively, as a non-voting group, because we're all here and only people in the chatroom can vote, we'll all collectively vote for Pixie Dust Underdrawers.

1237
01:32:08,524 --> 01:32:09,585
[SPEAKER_13]: All of us except you.

1238
01:32:10,826 --> 01:32:21,994
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, which one is it?

1239
01:32:22,174 --> 01:32:22,675
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's go to break.

1240
01:32:23,715 --> 01:32:29,720
[SPEAKER_10]: Sounds like a good idea.

1241
01:32:30,600 --> 01:32:30,981
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

1242
01:32:33,242 --> 01:32:34,183
[SPEAKER_07]: The fan is on.

1243
01:32:34,203 --> 01:32:34,964
[SPEAKER_07]: This is great.

1244
01:32:35,504 --> 01:32:37,786
[SPEAKER_07]: Now I feel like I'm in Hurricane Force winds.

1245
01:32:38,973 --> 01:32:39,554
[SPEAKER_13]: We'll be back.

1246
01:32:40,134 --> 01:32:43,077
[SPEAKER_13]: And after this break, I actually have some DDR music.

1247
01:32:43,857 --> 01:32:45,419
[SPEAKER_13]: Not DDR music, DDR news.

1248
01:32:45,859 --> 01:32:47,941
[SPEAKER_13]: Because we have home versions coming out very soon.

1249
01:32:47,981 --> 01:32:48,782
[SPEAKER_13]: We've got to talk about this.

1250
01:32:48,802 --> 01:32:50,443
[SPEAKER_13]: A lot of news on the home versions this week.

1251
01:32:51,344 --> 01:32:54,847
[SPEAKER_13]: And a lot of making fun of them that we have to do when we come back.

1252
01:32:55,627 --> 01:32:56,929
[SPEAKER_07]: Hooray for making fun of stuff.

1253
01:32:57,009 --> 01:32:57,669
[SPEAKER_07]: It's what we do best.

1254
01:32:57,689 --> 01:32:58,650
[SPEAKER_13]: Because that's what we do.

1255
01:33:00,251 --> 01:33:01,753
[SPEAKER_13]: Jamie, what's the song you want to hear this break?

1256
01:33:02,256 --> 01:33:03,177
[SPEAKER_07]: What song do I want to hear?

1257
01:33:03,357 --> 01:33:04,078
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

1258
01:33:04,979 --> 01:33:06,440
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to hear all the songs that everybody hates.

1259
01:33:06,520 --> 01:33:08,342
[SPEAKER_13]: I want to hear Cartoon Heroes, so we're putting that in.

1260
01:33:08,362 --> 01:33:09,263
[SPEAKER_07]: Put Cartoon Heroes in.

1261
01:33:09,303 --> 01:33:11,345
[SPEAKER_07]: Put Love That Feelin' in.

1262
01:33:12,206 --> 01:33:12,646
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, God.

1263
01:33:12,666 --> 01:33:14,108
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't even know if I can find Love That Feelin'.

1264
01:33:14,668 --> 01:33:14,849
[SPEAKER_13]: Is it?

1265
01:33:14,869 --> 01:33:14,969
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

1266
01:33:14,989 --> 01:33:17,912
[SPEAKER_07]: No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1267
01:33:17,932 --> 01:33:18,192
[SPEAKER_07]: Go back.

1268
01:33:18,312 --> 01:33:19,213
[SPEAKER_13]: No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1269
01:33:19,954 --> 01:33:24,979
[SPEAKER_07]: I want Volume 4 in.

1270
01:33:25,800 --> 01:33:25,980
[SPEAKER_13]: What?

1271
01:33:27,426 --> 01:33:27,687
[SPEAKER_13]: Volume 4.

1272
01:33:28,129 --> 01:33:28,731
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, that's enough.

1273
01:33:28,751 --> 01:33:29,072
[SPEAKER_13]: That's three.

1274
01:33:29,312 --> 01:33:29,573
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1275
01:33:29,975 --> 01:33:32,142
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, we'll be right back after this break.

1276
01:33:32,443 --> 01:33:33,005
[SPEAKER_13]: Stay tuned.

1277
01:33:33,025 --> 01:33:34,088
[SPEAKER_13]: You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

1278
01:33:34,128 --> 01:33:34,409
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1279
01:36:20,820 --> 01:36:21,321
[SPEAKER_16]: DarkSakura

1280
01:36:48,468 --> 01:37:06,961
I can't write down, can't write down a ship Round and round, move like a finger, come down Jack, Steve Burnett, get to the fever I'm kicking the floor, can't get right down the jerk In the box with my ticket to the floor, come down Jack, Steve Burnett, never forget, I'm a friend to the best Moving the juice

1281
01:37:31,039 --> 01:37:31,900
DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1282
01:38:17,452 --> 01:38:18,316
[SPEAKER_16]: Thanks for watching!

1283
01:39:52,031 --> 01:39:58,595
[SPEAKER_09]: Niko Meow, Niko Meow, Niko Meow, Meow, Meow Oh, Ash!

1284
01:39:59,136 --> 01:40:01,797
[SPEAKER_08]: This randomness could only be brought to you by Orange Lounge.

1285
01:40:05,340 --> 01:40:07,941
[SPEAKER_07]: We're back, and we're here.

1286
01:40:08,882 --> 01:40:12,344
[SPEAKER_07]: And Rob's running around, on fire, because he's so hot.

1287
01:40:13,045 --> 01:40:15,566
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're being attacked by a giant metallic man.

1288
01:40:17,408 --> 01:40:17,608
[SPEAKER_07]: Ah!

1289
01:40:18,388 --> 01:40:18,989
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1290
01:40:19,849 --> 01:40:20,330
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what?

1291
01:40:21,423 --> 01:40:26,765
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm thinking that because the chat room has demanded it, we should bring back one of our favorite segments.

1292
01:40:27,945 --> 01:40:29,006
[SPEAKER_07]: Match Game!

1293
01:40:29,326 --> 01:40:31,847
[SPEAKER_07]: But not immediately because someone has to write up the things for Match Game.

1294
01:40:32,547 --> 01:40:34,848
[SPEAKER_07]: So, we need to do the FUs of the week.

1295
01:40:34,888 --> 01:40:36,248
[SPEAKER_07]: That is a very important thing.

1296
01:40:36,929 --> 01:40:45,972
[SPEAKER_07]: So, well, you know, why don't you conduct the interview so I can...

1297
01:40:48,658 --> 01:40:49,138
[SPEAKER_14]: Interview?

1298
01:40:50,038 --> 01:40:51,159
[SPEAKER_14]: Am I supposed to be interviewing?

1299
01:40:51,499 --> 01:40:53,540
[SPEAKER_00]: Rob's going to... Let Rob do it.

1300
01:40:53,860 --> 01:40:55,700
[SPEAKER_00]: Rob's going to come... Hurry up, Rob.

1301
01:40:57,261 --> 01:40:58,861
[SPEAKER_00]: Let him count the money and you come over here.

1302
01:40:59,201 --> 01:40:59,481
Okay.

1303
01:41:00,242 --> 01:41:00,802
[SPEAKER_00]: Take that mic.

1304
01:41:01,722 --> 01:41:02,082
[SPEAKER_13]: Wait, what?

1305
01:41:02,122 --> 01:41:04,983
[SPEAKER_13]: Do you need me to write Match Game or do you want to do it?

1306
01:41:05,003 --> 01:41:06,544
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, James is going to do Match Game.

1307
01:41:06,744 --> 01:41:07,564
[SPEAKER_10]: Where's this cord going?

1308
01:41:07,724 --> 01:41:09,345
[SPEAKER_13]: It's going under Loki's chair.

1309
01:41:11,845 --> 01:41:13,206
[SPEAKER_10]: Stop moving your chair around.

1310
01:41:13,246 --> 01:41:14,726
[SPEAKER_13]: It's rolling over the cable.

1311
01:41:16,327 --> 01:41:16,707
[SPEAKER_13]: You know what?

1312
01:41:19,810 --> 01:41:21,511
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm going to walk circles around Loki while I do this.

1313
01:41:21,571 --> 01:41:21,771
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

1314
01:41:23,652 --> 01:41:26,174
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyway, so Puppy had a summer job.

1315
01:41:26,494 --> 01:41:26,594
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

1316
01:41:26,614 --> 01:41:27,695
[SPEAKER_13]: And where was this summer job at?

1317
01:41:28,015 --> 01:41:31,057
[SPEAKER_10]: At Castro Valley Golf Land, just like last summer.

1318
01:41:31,577 --> 01:41:31,877
[SPEAKER_13]: Uh-huh.

1319
01:41:32,438 --> 01:41:37,821
[SPEAKER_13]: And so I understand that last month you had a very interesting experience while you were working there at the night shift.

1320
01:41:39,182 --> 01:41:42,704
[SPEAKER_10]: A little thing called Armed Takeover Robbery.

1321
01:41:44,841 --> 01:41:50,525
[SPEAKER_13]: I know, see, you know what, and what I think is so great about this is that Puppy has such a great sense of humor about getting robbed at gunpoint.

1322
01:41:52,447 --> 01:41:53,888
[SPEAKER_13]: I know, it's kind of funny.

1323
01:41:54,929 --> 01:41:56,210
[SPEAKER_13]: So what happened, what happened?

1324
01:41:57,511 --> 01:42:06,858
[SPEAKER_10]: It was like, it was Sunday night, we closed at 11, but there was this last group of people out on the golf courses that was taking fucking forever, because they were trying to like...

1325
01:42:07,799 --> 01:42:25,708
[SPEAKER_10]: Jump on each other and beat each other up while they're golfing So they left about 11.30 And then we closed up the arcade The other employee that was there left So it was just me and the assistant manager there I went out to clean the bathrooms about 11.40 And then apparently some black truck came

1326
01:42:26,536 --> 01:42:28,837
[SPEAKER_10]: came creeping into the parking lot.

1327
01:42:28,857 --> 01:42:30,778
[SPEAKER_10]: Three guys jumped out all with guns.

1328
01:42:31,179 --> 01:42:31,939
[SPEAKER_10]: They come running up.

1329
01:42:32,039 --> 01:42:38,103
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm in the bathroom sitting there scrubbing the sink with a brush and all of a sudden I see two guys coming behind me.

1330
01:42:38,143 --> 01:42:40,064
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm like, you shut the fuck up right now.

1331
01:42:40,084 --> 01:42:41,765
[SPEAKER_10]: They're like, okay, whatever.

1332
01:42:42,405 --> 01:42:43,826
[SPEAKER_10]: And they both have their guns.

1333
01:42:43,846 --> 01:42:46,387
[SPEAKER_10]: They're just kind of nonchalant.

1334
01:42:46,408 --> 01:42:48,088
[SPEAKER_12]: Were you high off the cleaning fumes?

1335
01:42:48,189 --> 01:42:48,869
[SPEAKER_12]: Is that what it is?

1336
01:42:50,810 --> 01:42:52,891
[SPEAKER_12]: No, it's not that kind of cleaning fumes.

1337
01:42:53,171 --> 01:42:54,712
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not those kind of cleaning fluids.

1338
01:42:54,732 --> 01:42:55,693
[SPEAKER_10]: I wish it was, though.

1339
01:42:57,513 --> 01:43:04,716
[SPEAKER_10]: They basically were just like, yeah, we don't want to hurt nobody, where's the fucking money at, how do we get in, who else is in there, typical shit.

1340
01:43:06,257 --> 01:43:15,480
[SPEAKER_10]: And it was funny because the whole time I was just like, not even, I was pretty much ignoring the fact that they had guns.

1341
01:43:16,661 --> 01:43:22,623
[SPEAKER_10]: Because all three of them, they had, well, after the first two guys came in... Were they real guns?

1342
01:43:23,223 --> 01:43:25,925
[SPEAKER_10]: They probably were real guns, but chances are they weren't even loaded.

1343
01:43:25,945 --> 01:43:26,765
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1344
01:43:28,223 --> 01:43:33,386
[SPEAKER_10]: And it was kind of funny because I was sitting there standing there while the two guys with the guns were asking me questions.

1345
01:43:33,406 --> 01:43:35,507
[SPEAKER_10]: I saw the third guy come up around the corner of the building.

1346
01:43:35,947 --> 01:43:39,829
[SPEAKER_10]: And he comes running around like he's a fucking 007 or something.

1347
01:43:39,849 --> 01:43:40,669
[SPEAKER_13]: Like he was a QZAR.

1348
01:43:41,350 --> 01:43:42,430
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

1349
01:43:44,631 --> 01:43:48,313
[SPEAKER_10]: He comes running around the corner looking around like he's trying to see if there's anybody around.

1350
01:43:48,993 --> 01:43:52,655
[SPEAKER_10]: Like he's going to run in and tackle somebody.

1351
01:43:55,646 --> 01:43:56,186
[SPEAKER_10]: So what happened?

1352
01:43:56,206 --> 01:43:57,127
[SPEAKER_10]: They rounded you all up.

1353
01:43:58,027 --> 01:44:09,553
[SPEAKER_10]: They got me and the assistant manager, they took me around the back, through the workroom in the back, into the manager's office where the assistant manager's in there counting money.

1354
01:44:10,793 --> 01:44:12,854
[SPEAKER_10]: Actually, he just finished counting up all the money for the night.

1355
01:44:14,235 --> 01:44:19,458
[SPEAKER_10]: And we were about to make, he had a bag of money that was sealed up to drop off at the bank.

1356
01:44:20,600 --> 01:44:29,081
[SPEAKER_10]: so they had us both on the floor they duct taped our hands behind our backs and then dug through and made a fucking mess out of everything

1357
01:44:30,273 --> 01:44:38,516
[SPEAKER_00]: and then they took the money and they took a bucket of change that the assistant manager usually keeps with them to take to buy options.

1358
01:44:38,536 --> 01:44:39,316
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, draw plan tokens.

1359
01:44:39,676 --> 01:44:40,176
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, no.

1360
01:44:40,616 --> 01:44:43,397
[SPEAKER_00]: Surprisingly, they didn't take tokens, which was kind of funny.

1361
01:44:43,857 --> 01:44:45,658
[SPEAKER_13]: What would you do if you stole tokens?

1362
01:44:45,698 --> 01:44:46,618
[SPEAKER_13]: That's so sad.

1363
01:44:46,638 --> 01:44:49,319
[SPEAKER_12]: I know.

1364
01:44:49,359 --> 01:44:51,000
[SPEAKER_12]: It'd be kind of funny to see them all take tokens.

1365
01:44:51,060 --> 01:44:55,201
[SPEAKER_13]: Are you that hard up for DDR that you have to steal tokens at gunpoint?

1366
01:44:55,381 --> 01:44:56,541
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, they were black.

1367
01:44:56,561 --> 01:44:57,502
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't think they played DDR.

1368
01:44:58,682 --> 01:45:03,787
[SPEAKER_13]: I know some... There were black teenagers with guns.

1369
01:45:03,807 --> 01:45:05,128
[SPEAKER_13]: What the hell do you think?

1370
01:45:05,168 --> 01:45:07,110
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, he didn't have a gun and he wasn't a teenager.

1371
01:45:09,732 --> 01:45:10,172
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyway.

1372
01:45:12,474 --> 01:45:13,796
[SPEAKER_13]: We don't know what you would do with it, lovey.

1373
01:45:13,836 --> 01:45:16,738
[SPEAKER_13]: If I was a black teenager with a gun, I'd be playing DDR whenever I want.

1374
01:45:18,649 --> 01:45:20,290
[SPEAKER_13]: It wouldn't be no fucking lie.

1375
01:45:20,870 --> 01:45:21,831
[SPEAKER_10]: Not with a gun, anyway.

1376
01:45:22,711 --> 01:45:26,554
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, so they took his bucket of change, and he had sets of keys in there.

1377
01:45:26,574 --> 01:45:35,579
[SPEAKER_10]: They threw out two of his three sets of keys, which one of the keys was actually the set of keys to all the doors and all the games and stuff inside the arcade.

1378
01:45:35,839 --> 01:45:36,640
[SPEAKER_12]: They didn't take those.

1379
01:45:37,140 --> 01:45:39,641
[SPEAKER_12]: They said, I accidentally took his car keys.

1380
01:45:41,342 --> 01:45:44,024
[SPEAKER_12]: Now he can't get into his car, and he has to walk home.

1381
01:45:46,365 --> 01:45:52,168
[SPEAKER_10]: This is like, by the time this whole ordeal was done with the cops getting there and everything, it was like almost 2 in the morning.

1382
01:45:53,309 --> 01:45:56,790
[SPEAKER_10]: They had to go to Krispy Kreme and get them.

1383
01:45:58,731 --> 01:45:59,592
[SPEAKER_10]: How much money did it take?

1384
01:45:59,612 --> 01:46:00,432
[SPEAKER_13]: They made off with about $4,700.

1385
01:46:03,700 --> 01:46:04,661
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't seem like that much.

1386
01:46:04,701 --> 01:46:05,782
[SPEAKER_13]: That's all the golf I make?

1387
01:46:05,862 --> 01:46:09,945
[SPEAKER_13]: Shit.

1388
01:46:10,065 --> 01:46:11,406
[SPEAKER_10]: It's Castro Valley.

1389
01:46:11,646 --> 01:46:12,167
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm just kidding.

1390
01:46:12,447 --> 01:46:13,528
[SPEAKER_10]: It's Castro Valley, okay?

1391
01:46:13,968 --> 01:46:17,891
[SPEAKER_10]: We're not fucking Milpitas or Roseville or whatever.

1392
01:46:17,911 --> 01:46:18,952
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh my god.

1393
01:46:19,352 --> 01:46:19,933
[SPEAKER_13]: Roseville?

1394
01:46:19,993 --> 01:46:21,974
[SPEAKER_13]: Can you imagine how much money that place was making today?

1395
01:46:22,295 --> 01:46:24,516
[SPEAKER_13]: But they have a security guard.

1396
01:46:24,536 --> 01:46:25,937
[SPEAKER_13]: Not that we would advocate robbing.

1397
01:46:27,078 --> 01:46:27,679
[SPEAKER_13]: Just saying.

1398
01:46:27,839 --> 01:46:29,020
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe vandalism.

1399
01:46:30,061 --> 01:46:30,361
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe.

1400
01:46:31,602 --> 01:46:34,064
[SPEAKER_13]: No, we do not advocate any of those things.

1401
01:46:34,344 --> 01:46:36,025
[SPEAKER_13]: We're a good, polite show.

1402
01:46:37,246 --> 01:46:39,868
[SPEAKER_13]: But if you want to trip some little kids while you're there, feel free.

1403
01:46:42,590 --> 01:46:45,653
[SPEAKER_13]: Just don't damage the property, because we don't advocate that, because we don't want to get sued.

1404
01:46:46,133 --> 01:46:49,936
[SPEAKER_13]: Trip little kids all you want, though.

1405
01:46:49,996 --> 01:46:51,177
[SPEAKER_12]: I hate little kids.

1406
01:46:51,197 --> 01:46:53,199
[SPEAKER_12]: Then tell the kids to have their parents sue Golfland.

1407
01:46:56,814 --> 01:46:59,680
[SPEAKER_12]: The funny part was, as they left, they called the cops.

1408
01:47:01,348 --> 01:47:06,073
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, because they were nice robbers, and they wanted you guys to get untied at some point, but they weren't going to do it.

1409
01:47:06,353 --> 01:47:10,977
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, that would not be smart for the robbers to untie you, because they'd have to, like, untie you and run really, really fast.

1410
01:47:11,337 --> 01:47:14,921
[SPEAKER_13]: But they'd have to, like, untie you and then punch you in the face so you could slow down a little bit.

1411
01:47:15,381 --> 01:47:16,642
[SPEAKER_13]: But I don't think they wanted to do that.

1412
01:47:16,683 --> 01:47:18,564
[SPEAKER_13]: I think they just wanted to have somebody else come do it.

1413
01:47:19,305 --> 01:47:23,749
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, yeah, but you wouldn't have liked that if they'd untied you and then, like, punch you in the face, would you?

1414
01:47:24,090 --> 01:47:25,291
[SPEAKER_10]: If they... I would have...

1415
01:47:28,444 --> 01:47:37,430
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, if they were going to actually try, if they would have undone that, and there was just one of them in the room, I would have probably kicked the bloody crap out of him.

1416
01:47:38,150 --> 01:47:42,072
[SPEAKER_12]: Because, I mean, I could defend myself against one person, but not three, and if once.

1417
01:47:43,153 --> 01:47:47,696
[SPEAKER_10]: And then it would have been nice if also the gun that he had would have been loaded, that I could, you know, just use that.

1418
01:47:47,876 --> 01:47:48,396
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

1419
01:47:48,436 --> 01:47:51,318
[SPEAKER_10]: And then that's the whole dream sequence thing.

1420
01:47:52,619 --> 01:47:57,302
[SPEAKER_10]: Enter dream sequence, and I kill the other two guys, and I'm the hero, and yeah.

1421
01:48:01,914 --> 01:48:05,636
[SPEAKER_13]: Loki called him a loser I intentionally took the next day off

1422
01:48:23,913 --> 01:48:26,134
[SPEAKER_12]: Did you call in emotionally scarred to work?

1423
01:48:27,314 --> 01:48:34,558
[SPEAKER_12]: No, actually it was more like I needed to go out of the DMV because the fuckers took our driver's license.

1424
01:48:34,678 --> 01:48:39,700
[SPEAKER_12]: They took out both of our wallets, go through them, and take out just the driver's license.

1425
01:48:39,821 --> 01:48:43,262
[SPEAKER_12]: No cash, no credit cards, no anything else.

1426
01:48:43,342 --> 01:48:44,783
[SPEAKER_10]: Just our driver's licenses.

1427
01:48:46,277 --> 01:48:52,181
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, because I would have done them a lot of good, you know, to have your driver's license because, you know, you look just like a black teenager and all.

1428
01:48:52,641 --> 01:48:53,682
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I know.

1429
01:48:56,824 --> 01:48:57,685
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know about that.

1430
01:49:00,207 --> 01:49:00,547
[SPEAKER_14]: Anyway.

1431
01:49:00,927 --> 01:49:09,994
[SPEAKER_10]: They could have sold it to an illegal immigrant, but any other... Well, I ended up spending like three hours at the DMV the next day to get my new driver's license.

1432
01:49:10,274 --> 01:49:12,475
[SPEAKER_10]: And out of all that, I got a new picture on my driver's license.

1433
01:49:12,615 --> 01:49:13,176
[SPEAKER_10]: I hate old boys.

1434
01:49:15,010 --> 01:49:20,756
[SPEAKER_10]: and now my picture looks much better and more like me instead of me at 10 a.m.

1435
01:49:22,657 --> 01:49:23,398
Yay!

1436
01:49:24,379 --> 01:49:27,302
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, so anything else you want to add to your robbing a gunpoint story?

1437
01:49:29,504 --> 01:49:29,664
[SPEAKER_13]: No?

1438
01:49:30,085 --> 01:49:30,365
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

1439
01:49:31,226 --> 01:49:32,687
[SPEAKER_13]: Loki, why don't you give us a sim update?

1440
01:49:33,588 --> 01:49:34,249
[SPEAKER_13]: Sims!

1441
01:49:35,410 --> 01:49:36,131
[SPEAKER_13]: The Sims!

1442
01:49:37,079 --> 01:49:38,400
[SPEAKER_14]: Here's my update.

1443
01:49:38,600 --> 01:49:39,661
[SPEAKER_14]: There is no update.

1444
01:49:39,721 --> 01:49:40,961
[SPEAKER_14]: Nothing is going on.

1445
01:49:41,161 --> 01:49:42,842
[SPEAKER_14]: Absolutely, positively nothing.

1446
01:49:43,103 --> 01:49:45,464
[SPEAKER_00]: Except for the fact that you just downloaded a complete mix, too.

1447
01:49:45,924 --> 01:49:49,046
[SPEAKER_14]: That's an emulator, not a simulator.

1448
01:49:49,086 --> 01:49:50,487
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, okay, technicality, my bad.

1449
01:49:50,507 --> 01:49:54,890
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, and you know what pisses me off about this emulator?

1450
01:49:55,870 --> 01:49:56,691
[SPEAKER_14]: Is that, um...

1451
01:49:59,432 --> 01:50:12,203
[SPEAKER_14]: No, um, no, here's what the thing is, it's like, okay, I've got the hard drive image for the Japanese version of Complete Mix 2, yet I have the ROM for the US version of Complete Mix 2, and they don't work together.

1452
01:50:12,624 --> 01:50:13,505
[SPEAKER_14]: Ooh, that's not good.

1453
01:50:13,625 --> 01:50:18,749
[SPEAKER_14]: No, they do for, um, it's weird because they do for Complete Mix 1, but I don't know why it's not working for Complete Mix 1.

1454
01:50:18,789 --> 01:50:20,591
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought Complete Mix 1 was Hitmania.

1455
01:50:21,431 --> 01:50:22,011
[SPEAKER_14]: It's the same thing.

1456
01:50:22,272 --> 01:50:22,912
[SPEAKER_14]: Hip-hop mania.

1457
01:50:23,252 --> 01:50:27,115
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yeah, but maybe hip-hop mania and... Hip-hop mania is the same thing.

1458
01:50:27,135 --> 01:50:30,117
[SPEAKER_14]: It's just a different ROM, same hard drive image.

1459
01:50:31,598 --> 01:50:31,778
[SPEAKER_17]: Ooh.

1460
01:50:31,798 --> 01:50:34,400
[SPEAKER_17]: Ooh.

1461
01:50:34,700 --> 01:50:37,102
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, okay, so we got a lot of ground we want to cover here.

1462
01:50:37,122 --> 01:50:38,663
[SPEAKER_13]: I've got some DDR news I want to talk about.

1463
01:50:38,683 --> 01:50:39,543
[SPEAKER_13]: We want to do match game.

1464
01:50:39,563 --> 01:50:40,564
[SPEAKER_13]: We want to do the FUs of the week.

1465
01:50:40,604 --> 01:50:42,285
[SPEAKER_13]: So what do you guys want to do first?

1466
01:50:42,365 --> 01:50:42,685
[SPEAKER_13]: Jamie?

1467
01:50:43,766 --> 01:50:44,366
[SPEAKER_13]: Do you have preference?

1468
01:50:46,308 --> 01:50:47,549
[SPEAKER_13]: Jamie wants to do FUs next.

1469
01:50:47,909 --> 01:50:49,170
[SPEAKER_13]: So let's, um...

1470
01:50:50,771 --> 01:50:52,531
[SPEAKER_13]: We're going to go to a break and then come back and do the FUs.

1471
01:50:52,751 --> 01:50:55,232
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's do... Okay, let's do the FUs now.

1472
01:50:55,912 --> 01:50:57,373
[SPEAKER_13]: Chatroom can submit them while we're doing ours.

1473
01:50:57,393 --> 01:51:02,154
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh wait, no, she's going to put the music up herself.

1474
01:51:03,454 --> 01:51:04,614
[SPEAKER_13]: No, it's just going to take a second here.

1475
01:51:07,915 --> 01:51:12,056
[SPEAKER_13]: So if you want to submit an FU of the week, Chatroom, just send those over a private message to me right now.

1476
01:51:12,096 --> 01:51:13,917
[SPEAKER_13]: You can send those in while we're doing ours.

1477
01:51:15,948 --> 01:51:24,471
[SPEAKER_13]: Usually I give you guys a break, but people don't start sending them in anyway until they hear us doing ours, so I don't think it does a lot of good anyway, so... So forget it!

1478
01:51:26,591 --> 01:51:29,292
[SPEAKER_13]: So, Jamie, what happens during the FUs of the Week?

1479
01:51:29,712 --> 01:51:30,793
[SPEAKER_07]: And so we bitch about stuff.

1480
01:51:31,453 --> 01:51:32,213
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, here we go.

1481
01:51:43,657 --> 01:51:44,517
[SPEAKER_07]: Here is my foot.

1482
01:51:48,738 --> 01:51:55,603
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, my first FU of the week goes toward mixed auto sales in Roseville, and they're out of business now, the bitches.

1483
01:51:56,363 --> 01:51:57,384
[SPEAKER_07]: I bought my car from them.

1484
01:51:57,984 --> 01:52:00,606
[SPEAKER_07]: My car had a low idle, but he assured me, you know, it's fine.

1485
01:52:00,966 --> 01:52:01,627
[SPEAKER_07]: We can fix it.

1486
01:52:02,588 --> 01:52:04,069
[SPEAKER_07]: Now my engine is dead.

1487
01:52:04,329 --> 01:52:07,451
[SPEAKER_07]: Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, fuck you.

1488
01:52:08,211 --> 01:52:10,133
[SPEAKER_07]: I love my car, and now it's shit.

1489
01:52:10,853 --> 01:52:11,654
[SPEAKER_07]: Fuck him a whole lot.

1490
01:52:12,574 --> 01:52:14,135
[SPEAKER_07]: And I can't even begin to...

1491
01:52:15,735 --> 01:52:17,156
[SPEAKER_07]: Say how mad I am over this.

1492
01:52:17,596 --> 01:52:19,618
[SPEAKER_07]: Because who all has been in my car with me?

1493
01:52:21,119 --> 01:52:22,620
[SPEAKER_07]: Who all knows how much I love my car?

1494
01:52:23,661 --> 01:52:25,022
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, I love my car.

1495
01:52:25,682 --> 01:52:26,463
[SPEAKER_07]: And now it's shit.

1496
01:52:27,624 --> 01:52:29,185
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I hope he eats shit.

1497
01:52:30,286 --> 01:52:32,247
[SPEAKER_07]: And then poops it.

1498
01:52:32,928 --> 01:52:33,708
[SPEAKER_07]: And then has it.

1499
01:52:34,288 --> 01:52:36,510
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, he's obviously bankrupt.

1500
01:52:36,870 --> 01:52:41,734
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I want him to eat shit, poop it, and then have it fed intravenously to him.

1501
01:52:44,713 --> 01:52:45,756
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, 40 seconds.

1502
01:52:46,477 --> 01:52:47,139
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow.

1503
01:52:49,163 --> 01:52:53,072
[SPEAKER_07]: And then, and then, I want all of the shit blood drained from him.

1504
01:52:54,326 --> 01:52:58,049
[SPEAKER_07]: and then given to him as a suppository.

1505
01:52:59,310 --> 01:53:01,132
[SPEAKER_05]: I want him to have a bloodshot enema.

1506
01:53:01,752 --> 01:53:05,915
[SPEAKER_13]: This is such a tasteful show this evening.

1507
01:53:05,976 --> 01:53:06,856
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm so excited.

1508
01:53:06,876 --> 01:53:07,637
[SPEAKER_07]: I am so pissed off.

1509
01:53:07,677 --> 01:53:08,037
[SPEAKER_07]: No, no.

1510
01:53:08,738 --> 01:53:10,779
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't even get started when I'm really pissed off.

1511
01:53:10,819 --> 01:53:17,365
[SPEAKER_07]: When I am really, really, really pissed off, I think of the most foul and horrible things that will happen to people and then imagine them.

1512
01:53:18,777 --> 01:53:25,340
[SPEAKER_07]: This is me at work Friday, thinking of all kinds of foul... I've had days to think of how I want this man to die.

1513
01:53:27,101 --> 01:53:29,943
[SPEAKER_07]: I could come up with so many good tortures.

1514
01:53:30,163 --> 01:53:32,724
[SPEAKER_07]: But the thing is, is that just killing him wouldn't be enough.

1515
01:53:33,484 --> 01:53:36,286
[SPEAKER_07]: Because when you're dead, you can't talk to a dead person anymore.

1516
01:53:36,746 --> 01:53:40,208
[SPEAKER_07]: Unless you, like, you can pull their soul from the bowels of hell.

1517
01:53:40,548 --> 01:53:48,352
[SPEAKER_07]: But usually the bowels of hell are even worse than what, you know, what any single person alive could imagine.

1518
01:53:50,540 --> 01:53:56,145
[SPEAKER_10]: Just have a defibrillator handy so that when he actually dies, like, you wait five minutes, then bring him back to life and kill him again.

1519
01:53:57,666 --> 01:53:59,667
[SPEAKER_07]: And you can't do that much damage to somebody, though.

1520
01:54:00,068 --> 01:54:05,052
[SPEAKER_07]: And you'd have to, like, freeze them to death and then warm them up and, you know, thaw them out like a TV dinner.

1521
01:54:05,392 --> 01:54:06,153
[SPEAKER_07]: Ooh, microwave.

1522
01:54:06,433 --> 01:54:10,336
[SPEAKER_07]: But, you know, you could, like, stick his hand in a microwave and then trigger it to where his hand would explode.

1523
01:54:10,636 --> 01:54:11,517
[SPEAKER_07]: You'd live through that.

1524
01:54:11,557 --> 01:54:13,659
[SPEAKER_07]: You'd have a little bit of radiation poisoning, but you'd live.

1525
01:54:14,340 --> 01:54:16,862
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, you know, I'm mad.

1526
01:54:17,302 --> 01:54:17,682
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm mad.

1527
01:54:18,403 --> 01:54:19,224
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, I'm very mad.

1528
01:54:20,379 --> 01:54:25,161
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm mad that my antibiotics have done nothing but make me sick all week.

1529
01:54:25,781 --> 01:54:27,122
[SPEAKER_07]: But I took the last one today.

1530
01:54:27,962 --> 01:54:29,003
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm officially healthy.

1531
01:54:31,404 --> 01:54:35,125
[SPEAKER_07]: But I still have to take all the other crap and my nose is still running, so I didn't do crap for that.

1532
01:54:39,067 --> 01:54:41,888
[SPEAKER_07]: And then, and then, yes, I love my car.

1533
01:54:42,148 --> 01:54:43,189
[SPEAKER_07]: I said I love my car.

1534
01:54:43,309 --> 01:54:43,849
[SPEAKER_07]: Deal with it.

1535
01:54:44,609 --> 01:54:45,270
[SPEAKER_07]: I love my car.

1536
01:54:46,570 --> 01:54:47,951
[SPEAKER_07]: And then, fuck Nissan.

1537
01:54:49,605 --> 01:54:52,646
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I asked them if they would order me a Skyline and they said no.

1538
01:54:55,747 --> 01:54:56,227
[SPEAKER_07]: I want one.

1539
01:54:57,287 --> 01:54:58,848
[SPEAKER_07]: They said no.

1540
01:54:58,868 --> 01:55:00,808
[SPEAKER_07]: The dealerships will not actually import the cars.

1541
01:55:00,848 --> 01:55:03,769
[SPEAKER_07]: You have to go buy them yourself and ship it yourself.

1542
01:55:04,429 --> 01:55:06,610
[SPEAKER_07]: Which is fine because I know a place I can get one for $60,000.

1543
01:55:06,750 --> 01:55:09,811
[SPEAKER_07]: But that's $60,000 more.

1544
01:55:10,171 --> 01:55:11,451
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd go to my bank, hey, give me $60,000.

1545
01:55:11,552 --> 01:55:14,232
[SPEAKER_07]: I need to order me a car.

1546
01:55:14,632 --> 01:55:16,333
[SPEAKER_07]: They'd be like, uh, no.

1547
01:55:18,351 --> 01:55:27,679
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure, you can have it, but here's a, you know, 20% interest rate, you know, while we steal your firstborn, your liver, and your kidneys and sell them in New Orleans on the market.

1548
01:55:29,580 --> 01:55:33,503
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, well, they, yeah, it'd be great.

1549
01:55:33,883 --> 01:55:36,706
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I'll say, you can have my firstborn, and then I just won't breathe.

1550
01:55:37,286 --> 01:55:38,707
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm cool, I speak our hate.

1551
01:55:39,508 --> 01:55:41,770
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, and then, um,

1552
01:55:43,462 --> 01:55:44,783
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, fuck my computer.

1553
01:55:44,823 --> 01:55:54,509
[SPEAKER_07]: It does this weird thing, and I don't know why, where it will not save my image files as a JPEG or a GIF as they're uploaded on their sites as.

1554
01:55:54,929 --> 01:55:56,049
[SPEAKER_07]: It'll save it as a bitmap.

1555
01:55:56,830 --> 01:55:57,470
[SPEAKER_07]: Untitled bitmap.

1556
01:55:57,530 --> 01:55:59,451
[SPEAKER_07]: So I have to title everything.

1557
01:55:59,471 --> 01:56:05,535
[SPEAKER_07]: I have tons of bitmaps on my computer now, so it's taking up more space than it needs to, but then again, I have that under 20 gig hard drive, so I'm fine.

1558
01:56:06,556 --> 01:56:10,318
[SPEAKER_07]: And then... And then...

1559
01:56:12,236 --> 01:56:14,616
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, there's just really not a lot else.

1560
01:56:15,737 --> 01:56:16,677
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't really think of anything else.

1561
01:56:16,957 --> 01:56:18,957
[SPEAKER_07]: It's really my car, my car makes me cry.

1562
01:56:20,078 --> 01:56:28,779
[SPEAKER_07]: And oh yeah, a big, big F you to Phantasy Star Online for freezing when I was going into the ruins.

1563
01:56:28,899 --> 01:56:32,680
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we were just like, okay, we'd gone to TGI Fridays and left our games on idle.

1564
01:56:33,400 --> 01:56:39,381
[SPEAKER_07]: And I had the cord holding down my analog button on the menu so that it would keep scrolling through the menu and wouldn't log me off.

1565
01:56:40,022 --> 01:56:40,702
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm smart, see?

1566
01:56:41,742 --> 01:56:41,962
[SPEAKER_07]: Xbox

1567
01:56:43,385 --> 01:56:47,829
[SPEAKER_07]: I have the GameCube one, too.

1568
01:56:49,810 --> 01:56:49,971
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

1569
01:56:50,131 --> 01:56:52,132
[SPEAKER_07]: You can't do GameCube to Xbox.

1570
01:56:53,053 --> 01:56:54,394
[SPEAKER_07]: It does waste the money.

1571
01:56:54,635 --> 01:56:58,878
[SPEAKER_13]: If I remember right, they have different classes.

1572
01:56:59,018 --> 01:57:00,960
[SPEAKER_13]: GameCube has a class, a separate class of its own.

1573
01:57:01,040 --> 01:57:02,481
[SPEAKER_13]: Xbox has a separate class of its own, doesn't it?

1574
01:57:02,501 --> 01:57:03,662
[SPEAKER_07]: No, they have the same ones.

1575
01:57:03,922 --> 01:57:04,503
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh.

1576
01:57:04,523 --> 01:57:05,263
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, then that sucks.

1577
01:57:05,544 --> 01:57:06,745
[SPEAKER_07]: The Xbox one has more outfits.

1578
01:57:07,285 --> 01:57:07,405
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh.

1579
01:57:08,146 --> 01:57:09,007
[SPEAKER_07]: But at any rate, I...

1580
01:57:12,918 --> 01:57:14,980
[SPEAKER_07]: I came back and Julie got logged off.

1581
01:57:15,160 --> 01:57:34,193
[SPEAKER_07]: I stayed on so our room was intact and then so she logs on and everything and then as we're going down to the planet my game freezes and I can't catch all my equipped items including my devil wing mags and all my Alrapies and my god battle and my cross guards and everything but I lost my flight fan.

1582
01:57:35,374 --> 01:57:38,115
[SPEAKER_07]: And I lost, like, all of my crap items.

1583
01:57:38,135 --> 01:57:41,217
[SPEAKER_07]: So the thing is, is that I have max money, so it was kind of cool.

1584
01:57:41,237 --> 01:57:43,217
[SPEAKER_07]: But it was just aggravating having to go get all that stuff.

1585
01:57:44,178 --> 01:57:47,159
[SPEAKER_07]: So... And I went up, like, five levels that night.

1586
01:57:47,199 --> 01:57:47,659
[SPEAKER_07]: It was great.

1587
01:57:47,959 --> 01:57:48,460
[SPEAKER_07]: Six levels.

1588
01:57:49,040 --> 01:57:49,740
[SPEAKER_07]: Went up six levels.

1589
01:57:50,320 --> 01:57:51,861
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we did Endless Nightmare, and that was cool.

1590
01:57:52,941 --> 01:57:56,483
[SPEAKER_07]: Um... But another F you goes to Diet Pepsi for tasting like shit.

1591
01:57:57,323 --> 01:57:58,704
[SPEAKER_07]: But the vanilla Pepsi's not bad.

1592
01:57:59,024 --> 01:58:00,245
[SPEAKER_07]: The Diet Vanilla Pepsi's not bad.

1593
01:58:00,785 --> 01:58:03,086
[SPEAKER_07]: But regular Pepsi... And also...

1594
01:58:04,372 --> 01:58:09,516
[SPEAKER_07]: I drank a nine-month-old mudslide, so fuck my stomach for not being able to process it.

1595
01:58:09,936 --> 01:58:16,422
[SPEAKER_14]: I've got to give an FU to Pepsi for making a vanilla Pepsi that tastes so damn good, because I hate Pepsi.

1596
01:58:16,442 --> 01:58:18,343
[SPEAKER_07]: Vanilla Pepsi is the best.

1597
01:58:19,304 --> 01:58:20,745
[SPEAKER_13]: What did I say when vanilla Coke came out?

1598
01:58:20,785 --> 01:58:22,246
[SPEAKER_13]: I said, can't wait for vanilla Pepsi.

1599
01:58:22,306 --> 01:58:22,667
[SPEAKER_13]: Here it is.

1600
01:58:22,707 --> 01:58:25,409
[SPEAKER_07]: Vanilla Coke has that same Coke-y aftertaste.

1601
01:58:27,530 --> 01:58:31,634
[SPEAKER_07]: And another FU goes toward my lifestyle adjustment.

1602
01:58:33,154 --> 01:58:38,558
[SPEAKER_07]: because on the outside it looks successful, but not when I stepped on the scale, so.

1603
01:58:39,779 --> 01:58:41,059
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm using my gym membership now.

1604
01:58:41,380 --> 01:58:43,221
[SPEAKER_07]: And fuck everybody who won't go to the gym with me.

1605
01:58:43,281 --> 01:58:43,701
[SPEAKER_07]: I hate you.

1606
01:58:47,164 --> 01:58:47,824
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, I don't hate you.

1607
01:58:47,864 --> 01:58:48,304
[SPEAKER_07]: I was kidding.

1608
01:58:48,745 --> 01:58:49,005
[SPEAKER_13]: I know.

1609
01:58:49,245 --> 01:58:50,506
[SPEAKER_07]: But I hate the guy who sold me my car.

1610
01:58:50,926 --> 01:58:51,547
[SPEAKER_07]: I know why I'm dead.

1611
01:58:52,947 --> 01:58:53,288
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm aware.

1612
01:58:53,308 --> 01:58:54,088
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I don't want him dead.

1613
01:58:54,128 --> 01:58:54,909
[SPEAKER_07]: I want him dead.

1614
01:58:55,569 --> 01:58:56,510
[SPEAKER_07]: I need a basement.

1615
01:58:56,590 --> 01:58:57,751
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh my God, I need a basement.

1616
01:58:58,826 --> 01:59:02,988
[SPEAKER_07]: If I had a basement, I could so set up the perfect torture chamber there.

1617
01:59:03,008 --> 01:59:04,448
[SPEAKER_13]: I could see Jamie there right now.

1618
01:59:04,788 --> 01:59:07,149
[SPEAKER_13]: It puts the lotion on its skin and puts it in the basket.

1619
01:59:07,669 --> 01:59:13,432
[SPEAKER_13]: And, oh yeah, fuck CD Japan for making the pre-order for Battle Royale 2 80 bucks.

1620
01:59:22,918 --> 01:59:23,378
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

1621
01:59:24,178 --> 01:59:26,299
[SPEAKER_07]: You should see how much it is on YesAsia.com.

1622
01:59:26,319 --> 01:59:26,779
[SPEAKER_07]: Fuck that shit.

1623
01:59:26,799 --> 01:59:26,999
[SPEAKER_17]: Piracy!

1624
01:59:27,599 --> 01:59:31,940
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just going to see if Anime Jungle Osaka can order it for me.

1625
01:59:31,960 --> 01:59:34,160
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I'll at least get it for $60 there.

1626
01:59:36,121 --> 01:59:38,321
[SPEAKER_13]: Because Jamie actually collects the real thing.

1627
01:59:38,401 --> 01:59:45,282
[SPEAKER_07]: I buy the real thing so I can watch it on my big TV with my DVD player over and over and over again.

1628
01:59:45,683 --> 01:59:50,964
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I can copy the DVDs for my friends and get a nice transfer.

1629
01:59:51,084 --> 01:59:51,684
[SPEAKER_13]: What an angel.

1630
01:59:51,844 --> 01:59:52,644
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, next.

1631
01:59:53,823 --> 01:59:54,623
[SPEAKER_13]: Loki, your turn.

1632
01:59:59,104 --> 02:00:00,145
[SPEAKER_13]: Mario Golf?

1633
02:00:01,065 --> 02:00:02,685
[SPEAKER_13]: Mario Golf is cool!

1634
02:00:03,385 --> 02:00:03,905
[SPEAKER_13]: Shut up, loser.

1635
02:00:04,225 --> 02:00:10,227
[SPEAKER_14]: Anyways, first I'm going to start off with a big FP2 speedy oil change because you suck.

1636
02:00:10,267 --> 02:00:14,348
[SPEAKER_14]: And the fact that you made me wait four hours to get my, you know, tune-up the first time.

1637
02:00:14,688 --> 02:00:17,349
[SPEAKER_14]: Then I come to find out you ripped me off on the tune-up.

1638
02:00:17,669 --> 02:00:18,949
[SPEAKER_14]: Then you break my car.

1639
02:00:20,154 --> 02:00:24,356
[SPEAKER_14]: I think you wanted us to put a lawnmower engine in there.

1640
02:00:51,252 --> 02:00:54,795
[SPEAKER_14]: Why do I hear Ultimate Cheeseburger?

1641
02:01:00,420 --> 02:01:02,102
[SPEAKER_13]: Don't you listen to this show occasionally?

1642
02:01:04,504 --> 02:01:06,165
[SPEAKER_13]: Not when I have to work Sunday nights.

1643
02:01:08,548 --> 02:01:11,971
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, but there's always Rewind on Thursday evening.

1644
02:01:12,992 --> 02:01:15,474
[SPEAKER_13]: Which I am also usually working on or sleeping.

1645
02:01:16,306 --> 02:01:17,046
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, sleeping.

1646
02:01:17,507 --> 02:01:17,947
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm sorry.

1647
02:01:18,307 --> 02:01:19,128
[SPEAKER_14]: That's no excuse.

1648
02:01:20,609 --> 02:01:23,190
[SPEAKER_14]: That's unacceptable.

1649
02:01:23,870 --> 02:01:26,632
[SPEAKER_14]: F you to stupid people who can't drive.

1650
02:01:27,472 --> 02:01:30,774
[SPEAKER_14]: And normally those people that turn out in front of me and then go slow.

1651
02:01:32,175 --> 02:01:33,216
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, and another thing.

1652
02:01:33,536 --> 02:01:37,598
[SPEAKER_14]: If you're driving a racer, you should not be going slower than I am.

1653
02:01:38,519 --> 02:01:38,879
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay?

1654
02:01:39,399 --> 02:01:42,041
[SPEAKER_14]: You're in a souped up car, supposedly.

1655
02:01:43,803 --> 02:01:52,568
[SPEAKER_07]: Remember, the typical rice car, rice mobile now has like, you know, a stupid four banger in it and a hole in the muffler to sound hot.

1656
02:01:53,609 --> 02:01:54,369
[SPEAKER_07]: And then just like this.

1657
02:01:54,389 --> 02:01:57,651
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, but they had already just did all the like body modifications to it.

1658
02:01:57,911 --> 02:02:01,453
[SPEAKER_14]: Hasn't quite painted it yet, but they've done all the body modifications for it.

1659
02:02:02,114 --> 02:02:04,655
[SPEAKER_14]: And they were going really slow in the slow lane.

1660
02:02:04,915 --> 02:02:08,537
[SPEAKER_14]: And I was trying to pass them because I was trying to, you know, go home.

1661
02:02:08,797 --> 02:02:10,318
[SPEAKER_13]: Have you ever tried doing that to somebody?

1662
02:02:10,518 --> 02:02:11,119
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a blast.

1663
02:02:11,139 --> 02:02:11,219
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

1664
02:02:13,804 --> 02:02:14,244
[SPEAKER_14]: I hate that.

1665
02:02:15,424 --> 02:02:22,286
[SPEAKER_14]: But anyways, F you to Radio Shack for having the parts I need but overcharging on everything.

1666
02:02:22,826 --> 02:02:28,427
[SPEAKER_14]: It's like I'm buying stuff with Canadian dollars or something like that.

1667
02:02:29,687 --> 02:02:32,107
[SPEAKER_14]: It costs like 4,000 times the amount.

1668
02:02:34,928 --> 02:02:35,208
[SPEAKER_14]: What?

1669
02:02:39,389 --> 02:02:40,269
[SPEAKER_14]: Stretch arms, Sean.

1670
02:02:45,043 --> 02:02:48,265
[SPEAKER_14]: I bought S-Video cables to hook up the TV today.

1671
02:02:48,965 --> 02:02:51,886
[SPEAKER_14]: First off, they don't sell anything larger than 12 feet for S-Video.

1672
02:02:51,946 --> 02:03:00,469
[SPEAKER_14]: Sure, they have 100 foot regular AV cables, but no, we don't have S-Video cables that are longer than 12 feet.

1673
02:03:00,509 --> 02:03:06,712
[SPEAKER_14]: So I had to buy two S-Video cables and a connector for the two of them.

1674
02:03:08,613 --> 02:03:09,233
[SPEAKER_14]: That cost $45.

1675
02:03:09,373 --> 02:03:10,414
[SPEAKER_14]: Holy crap!

1676
02:03:10,874 --> 02:03:17,817
[SPEAKER_13]: Because it was $20 for each table and then the little piece of crap that I kid you not is about an inch.

1677
02:03:18,418 --> 02:03:18,898
[SPEAKER_13]: Inch big.

1678
02:03:19,298 --> 02:03:20,378
[SPEAKER_13]: Couldn't cost that much to make.

1679
02:03:20,418 --> 02:03:20,639
[SPEAKER_13]: Cost $6.

1680
02:03:24,060 --> 02:03:24,540
[SPEAKER_14]: I hate them.

1681
02:03:26,641 --> 02:03:33,244
[SPEAKER_14]: So... Well, yeah, but it's far away in Atlanta.

1682
02:03:33,264 --> 02:03:33,905
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

1683
02:03:35,045 --> 02:03:36,646
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what you get for living in Fulton.

1684
02:03:39,654 --> 02:03:42,598
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm going to have a meme cabinet soon, so if that doesn't bother me.

1685
02:03:42,618 --> 02:03:43,038
[SPEAKER_14]: My turn.

1686
02:03:49,870 --> 02:03:56,754
[SPEAKER_13]: F you to people that aren't willing to drive 10 miles over the speed limit on windy roads because that's what they're built for, is going fast.

1687
02:03:56,994 --> 02:03:57,415
[SPEAKER_13]: Word.

1688
02:03:58,695 --> 02:04:04,359
[SPEAKER_13]: And F you as well to the fact that it's easy to climb up a rock.

1689
02:04:04,779 --> 02:04:05,980
[SPEAKER_12]: You handed the mic to me, buddy.

1690
02:04:07,461 --> 02:04:13,344
[SPEAKER_12]: F you to the fact that it's easy to climb up... I'll go back to you and wind them then.

1691
02:04:14,825 --> 02:04:19,148
[SPEAKER_13]: F you to the fact that it's easy to climb up a rock, but it's not easy to get down.

1692
02:04:20,984 --> 02:04:22,225
[SPEAKER_13]: Jumping is not an option.

1693
02:04:22,385 --> 02:04:26,107
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, you know, wasting all that time and energy humping the rock, you know.

1694
02:04:26,387 --> 02:04:27,648
[SPEAKER_13]: I did not hump a rock.

1695
02:04:28,789 --> 02:04:33,392
[SPEAKER_13]: F you to that lady who made us stand guard while she took a pee behind the rock.

1696
02:04:34,958 --> 02:04:38,101
[SPEAKER_13]: You should have taken a picture.

1697
02:04:38,401 --> 02:04:39,122
[SPEAKER_13]: I almost did.

1698
02:04:39,182 --> 02:04:40,643
[SPEAKER_13]: I had to go have a picture of her somewhere.

1699
02:04:41,023 --> 02:04:44,406
[SPEAKER_13]: And then when you see what this woman looks like, you'll understand why I did not want to get a picture of her peeing.

1700
02:04:44,426 --> 02:04:47,068
[SPEAKER_12]: She's like, she's peeing behind the rock.

1701
02:04:47,388 --> 02:04:49,190
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh my God, look at that pee.

1702
02:04:49,270 --> 02:04:54,754
[SPEAKER_12]: See, there was the evil side of me that wanted to go stand next to the rock and go, Oh my God, woman peeing.

1703
02:04:57,176 --> 02:05:00,039
[SPEAKER_12]: And watch all the little kids run over.

1704
02:05:00,059 --> 02:05:01,540
[SPEAKER_12]: Watch all the little kids run over.

1705
02:05:05,427 --> 02:05:23,056
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm an F you also to the Vacaville Arcade that stars because that DDR machine got misses when I should not be getting misses and I could have had the number one score on that machine easy and your machine sucks my butt and what the hell, you have all your pink arrows on one side and all the blues on the other side.

1706
02:05:23,096 --> 02:05:23,896
[SPEAKER_13]: And on the wrong side too.

1707
02:05:23,916 --> 02:05:24,317
[SPEAKER_13]: That's gay.

1708
02:05:24,597 --> 02:05:25,397
[SPEAKER_13]: That's really gay.

1709
02:05:26,658 --> 02:05:27,038
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm done.

1710
02:05:27,518 --> 02:05:28,739
[SPEAKER_13]: Back to Loki because I'm rude.

1711
02:05:29,915 --> 02:05:29,975
[SPEAKER_13]: F.E.

1712
02:05:30,195 --> 02:05:35,119
[SPEAKER_13]: to Scandia for putting a shooting gallery inside your arcade.

1713
02:05:36,220 --> 02:05:37,341
[SPEAKER_13]: What were you thinking?

1714
02:05:37,841 --> 02:05:40,323
[SPEAKER_13]: Why is there a shooting gallery in an arcade?

1715
02:05:41,244 --> 02:05:47,009
[SPEAKER_13]: With like a freaking, you're playing 2DX or DDR, and I might add the DDR is broken.

1716
02:05:48,950 --> 02:05:49,431
[SPEAKER_13]: All of them.

1717
02:05:51,232 --> 02:05:55,894
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, but all the arrows suck on DDR now, so I can't play doubles or anything.

1718
02:05:56,254 --> 02:06:02,198
[SPEAKER_14]: But, like, the shooting gallery, so you're playing 2DX, and it's all... What's that noise?

1719
02:06:02,378 --> 02:06:08,261
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, that was someone shooting... That's the shooting range.

1720
02:06:08,521 --> 02:06:10,542
[SPEAKER_13]: Like, I'm playing Sync, right?

1721
02:06:10,603 --> 02:06:16,386
[SPEAKER_13]: I have a 200-something combo going, and then all of a sudden... And, bam, combo broken.

1722
02:06:24,146 --> 02:06:25,888
[SPEAKER_13]: I wish the timing was just that good.

1723
02:06:26,508 --> 02:06:32,194
[SPEAKER_13]: F you to the people at Paramount that thought it was a good idea to do yet another movie about Tupac.

1724
02:06:33,294 --> 02:06:35,175
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, they're making another Tupac movie.

1725
02:06:35,355 --> 02:06:36,555
[SPEAKER_13]: Tupac Resurrection.

1726
02:06:40,456 --> 02:06:40,917
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm sorry.

1727
02:06:41,177 --> 02:06:41,757
[SPEAKER_13]: That's cool.

1728
02:06:42,057 --> 02:06:42,637
[SPEAKER_13]: That's cool.

1729
02:06:43,738 --> 02:06:48,859
[SPEAKER_13]: Dude, Tupac has more sequels than Batman.

1730
02:06:48,879 --> 02:06:50,320
[SPEAKER_13]: We're all going to go opening day.

1731
02:06:53,061 --> 02:06:55,341
[SPEAKER_13]: Tupac Resurrection opening day.

1732
02:06:56,502 --> 02:06:59,083
[SPEAKER_13]: Seriously.

1733
02:06:59,483 --> 02:07:00,463
[SPEAKER_13]: It's going to be fulsome.

1734
02:07:00,523 --> 02:07:00,923
[SPEAKER_13]: Come on.

1735
02:07:02,464 --> 02:07:02,704
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyway.

1736
02:07:04,533 --> 02:07:21,777
[SPEAKER_13]: So, yeah, that sucks, and, um, I'm trying to think what, oh, yeah, um, F you to, um, pretty much, oh, F you to the fat bitch, oh, the stupid kid that was actually asking, begging for money while playing DDR and then kept getting louder and louder because I was ignoring him.

1737
02:07:22,757 --> 02:07:23,078
[SPEAKER_13]: What?

1738
02:07:24,238 --> 02:07:25,598
[SPEAKER_13]: Do you have any tokens I can have?

1739
02:07:25,838 --> 02:07:26,138
[SPEAKER_13]: No.

1740
02:07:26,378 --> 02:07:27,839
[SPEAKER_13]: Do you have any tokens I can have?

1741
02:07:28,079 --> 02:07:28,399
[SPEAKER_13]: No.

1742
02:07:28,879 --> 02:07:30,279
[SPEAKER_14]: Why is this wrapped around my chair?

1743
02:07:30,539 --> 02:07:31,019
[SPEAKER_14]: Again.

1744
02:07:32,420 --> 02:07:32,960
[SPEAKER_14]: Stop it.

1745
02:07:39,477 --> 02:07:40,477
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not moving anywhere.

1746
02:07:41,558 --> 02:07:48,123
[SPEAKER_14]: But anyways... Oh, F you to the fact that 27 inch TVs can't fit in my car very easily.

1747
02:07:48,903 --> 02:07:52,766
[SPEAKER_14]: That wasn't fun in the hot sun trying to cram a TV into the side of my car.

1748
02:07:56,509 --> 02:07:57,549
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, it was funny though.

1749
02:07:58,430 --> 02:07:59,671
[SPEAKER_13]: What the hell?

1750
02:08:02,401 --> 02:08:02,641
[SPEAKER_13]: What?

1751
02:08:03,061 --> 02:08:04,262
[SPEAKER_13]: I haven't moved at all.

1752
02:08:04,522 --> 02:08:08,364
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, I've been sitting there, people have been like, okay, let's wrap it around me.

1753
02:08:17,208 --> 02:08:25,932
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, so... I am Satan, Satan, you will die.

1754
02:08:25,952 --> 02:08:30,454
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, your chair has been liberated from the microphone cord.

1755
02:08:30,899 --> 02:08:32,160
[SPEAKER_13]: F you to John Ritter dying.

1756
02:08:32,300 --> 02:08:34,842
[SPEAKER_13]: Doesn't he know that he has entertainment he has to do?

1757
02:08:35,102 --> 02:08:36,863
[SPEAKER_13]: Why does he have to go have heart problems now?

1758
02:08:37,103 --> 02:08:39,024
[SPEAKER_13]: It's because he wasn't eating enough bacon.

1759
02:08:39,344 --> 02:08:41,946
[SPEAKER_13]: He has to condition his heart for bad food.

1760
02:08:43,807 --> 02:08:44,527
[SPEAKER_13]: I blame him.

1761
02:08:45,368 --> 02:08:47,209
[SPEAKER_13]: Actually, I blame Suzanne Somers.

1762
02:08:47,429 --> 02:08:48,690
[SPEAKER_13]: It was all her fault.

1763
02:08:49,190 --> 02:08:51,592
[SPEAKER_13]: Suzanne Somers is the death of him.

1764
02:08:51,892 --> 02:08:53,153
[SPEAKER_13]: John Ritter sucked anyway.

1765
02:08:54,683 --> 02:08:56,325
[SPEAKER_07]: I grew up with Reach Company, hello.

1766
02:08:56,845 --> 02:08:58,426
[SPEAKER_13]: But it was Suzanne Somers.

1767
02:08:59,427 --> 02:09:03,030
[SPEAKER_07]: When I read that he died, the only thing that I could think of was this movie that I saw.

1768
02:09:03,070 --> 02:09:11,197
[SPEAKER_13]: If you have to be stuck on an island fighting off Indians with either Suzanne Somers or John Ritter, you will want John Ritter on your side.

1769
02:09:13,159 --> 02:09:14,740
[SPEAKER_13]: Suzanne Somers would be scarier.

1770
02:09:17,088 --> 02:09:17,588
[SPEAKER_12]: Am I right?

1771
02:09:18,069 --> 02:09:19,370
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, but that's the whole point.

1772
02:09:19,470 --> 02:09:23,052
[SPEAKER_07]: All you need to do is start crying and talking about the starving children in China.

1773
02:09:23,092 --> 02:09:27,355
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, and another thing, the FU segment left like 10 minutes ago.

1774
02:09:27,515 --> 02:09:28,696
[SPEAKER_13]: I got one more.

1775
02:09:29,396 --> 02:09:34,140
[SPEAKER_13]: FU to J-Lo and Ben Affleck, because guess what?

1776
02:09:34,260 --> 02:09:38,783
[SPEAKER_13]: Your marriage lasted as long as Gigli did in the box office.

1777
02:09:39,743 --> 02:09:40,284
Bam!

1778
02:09:40,904 --> 02:09:41,525
[SPEAKER_13]: You suck.

1779
02:09:42,465 --> 02:09:43,166
[SPEAKER_13]: They broke up.

1780
02:09:44,295 --> 02:09:45,436
[SPEAKER_13]: Because he had second thoughts.

1781
02:09:45,476 --> 02:09:47,177
[SPEAKER_13]: He's like, dude, I don't know if I can marry her.

1782
02:09:47,737 --> 02:09:48,737
[SPEAKER_13]: He's such a pansy.

1783
02:09:51,739 --> 02:09:53,280
[SPEAKER_13]: Her ass comes alive at night.

1784
02:09:53,380 --> 02:09:54,660
[SPEAKER_12]: I can't handle it.

1785
02:09:56,181 --> 02:10:01,104
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm looking at a bunch of straight men talking about the wedding of Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez.

1786
02:10:01,204 --> 02:10:02,865
[SPEAKER_13]: I can't believe they're not going to get married.

1787
02:10:04,526 --> 02:10:04,926
[SPEAKER_13]: Gay.

1788
02:10:05,666 --> 02:10:06,767
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you for picking that.

1789
02:10:07,187 --> 02:10:10,769
[SPEAKER_07]: This is the other ironic thing is that I could give less than a shit about them.

1790
02:10:11,775 --> 02:10:12,836
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't fucking care.

1791
02:10:12,956 --> 02:10:14,476
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't care what the bitch is wearing.

1792
02:10:14,816 --> 02:10:16,097
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't care where they're getting married.

1793
02:10:16,137 --> 02:10:17,278
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't care if they broke up.

1794
02:10:17,498 --> 02:10:18,558
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't care if they mate.

1795
02:10:18,978 --> 02:10:19,699
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't care.

1796
02:10:20,319 --> 02:10:21,419
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's watch some guns.

1797
02:10:22,340 --> 02:10:24,561
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a good thing because they're not going to breed now.

1798
02:10:25,141 --> 02:10:32,925
[SPEAKER_13]: And you know what's funny is NASA's crashing a 1.5 billion dollar satellite or whatever, a probe, into their house?

1799
02:10:33,145 --> 02:10:38,087
[SPEAKER_14]: No, into Jupiter because they're afraid that bacteria might infect the moon around Jupiter.

1800
02:10:40,171 --> 02:10:40,831
[SPEAKER_14]: Wow!

1801
02:10:41,252 --> 02:11:02,004
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, taxpayers' dollars going down the drain because PETA or some, I'm sure it's PETA because PETA's behind all the bad shit, um, you know, they're probably like going, Well, it's that condamnator who lives his life on the moon even though we have value and he lives his life there and the bacteria wipes it out so he won't feel guilty.

1802
02:11:02,325 --> 02:11:05,907
[SPEAKER_12]: Then the satellite crashing into the moon will kill everything on that moon.

1803
02:11:07,488 --> 02:11:13,732
[SPEAKER_14]: I hope there's an evolving civilization on Jupiter and it crushes them all!

1804
02:11:14,192 --> 02:11:16,974
[SPEAKER_07]: It would be in Jupiter because Jupiter's a big gaseous mass.

1805
02:11:18,195 --> 02:11:19,176
[SPEAKER_14]: Much like Suzanne Somers.

1806
02:11:19,236 --> 02:11:20,436
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

1807
02:11:22,118 --> 02:11:22,498
[SPEAKER_14]: Again.

1808
02:11:22,778 --> 02:11:23,218
[SPEAKER_14]: Bam.

1809
02:11:24,959 --> 02:11:25,800
[SPEAKER_13]: You're so punny.

1810
02:11:26,160 --> 02:11:27,101
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, is it my turn?

1811
02:11:29,728 --> 02:11:52,386
[SPEAKER_12]: I've got a couple of FUs, a couple of political FUs actually FU to what's-her-name, that one chick who's not getting any votes For not getting any votes, I wish she would The one who's got like 5% and who needs more

1812
02:11:53,550 --> 02:11:54,970
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, Ariana Huffington.

1813
02:11:55,010 --> 02:11:57,651
[SPEAKER_14]: I forgot her name.

1814
02:11:58,731 --> 02:11:59,652
[SPEAKER_13]: She needs more votes.

1815
02:11:59,752 --> 02:12:03,013
[SPEAKER_13]: Ariana Huffington is the greatest candidate in the election, and you should vote for her because I am.

1816
02:12:03,033 --> 02:12:09,234
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't care if she's only getting a little bit of the vote, but she's great, and she supports everything I believe in, and you suck.

1817
02:12:10,034 --> 02:12:13,715
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm saying she needs more votes, man.

1818
02:12:15,296 --> 02:12:18,937
[SPEAKER_13]: She needs more votes for not getting enough votes.

1819
02:12:21,207 --> 02:12:24,129
[SPEAKER_13]: And also... Because she's not selling her body like the other candidates.

1820
02:12:25,390 --> 02:12:26,851
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, she's not getting any votes either.

1821
02:12:26,891 --> 02:12:29,013
[SPEAKER_12]: She's just getting a bunch of phone calls.

1822
02:12:29,653 --> 02:12:34,257
[SPEAKER_12]: Anyway, also a F you to Tom McClintock for being an ass.

1823
02:12:34,977 --> 02:12:45,345
[SPEAKER_12]: And on a side note, I'd like to say F you to Nomo Ono and Silent Prophet for twisting my fragile little mind.

1824
02:12:46,686 --> 02:12:49,908
[SPEAKER_10]: And all I have left to say is mazel tov.

1825
02:12:51,997 --> 02:12:52,978
[SPEAKER_10]: My turn, Durand.

1826
02:12:53,738 --> 02:12:58,381
[SPEAKER_10]: Um... Okay, uh... How come there's no music?

1827
02:12:59,742 --> 02:13:00,322
[SPEAKER_10]: I can't hear it.

1828
02:13:00,722 --> 02:13:02,583
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, then you should turn up your hearing aid.

1829
02:13:04,665 --> 02:13:05,645
[SPEAKER_10]: What, Sonny?

1830
02:13:05,665 --> 02:13:09,167
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, um... Okay.

1831
02:13:10,008 --> 02:13:13,650
[SPEAKER_10]: For one... Fuck traffic.

1832
02:13:14,090 --> 02:13:17,993
[SPEAKER_10]: Because I hate traffic, and it's a pain in the ass, especially on every freeway.

1833
02:13:18,393 --> 02:13:19,934
[SPEAKER_07]: And all the people who were on the road today.

1834
02:13:20,430 --> 02:13:30,314
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes That dumb bitch that wouldn't get out of my fucking lane That woman, oh my god That woman was stupid And did you see the big jet in the back of her van?

1835
02:13:30,454 --> 02:13:46,299
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, it was probably from somebody that she cut off like that She deserved it, bitch She looked like, like Sloth from the Goonies I didn't get to see her, but I got to see you flip her off Then, uh

1836
02:13:50,250 --> 02:13:54,373
[SPEAKER_10]: Fuck Disneyland for ruining Big Thunder Mountain Railroad by having somebody die on it.

1837
02:13:55,773 --> 02:13:58,835
[SPEAKER_12]: Because I love that ride, and now it's a death trap.

1838
02:14:02,518 --> 02:14:03,038
[SPEAKER_07]: I love that ride.

1839
02:14:03,058 --> 02:14:06,380
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm waiting for a bunch of people to die on, you know, Mr. Toad's Wild Ride.

1840
02:14:08,081 --> 02:14:12,424
[SPEAKER_10]: They're gonna get thrown out of a car and land on the ground and get run over by a car on a track.

1841
02:14:12,504 --> 02:14:14,225
[SPEAKER_07]: One of the animatronics runs over them.

1842
02:14:15,293 --> 02:14:20,056
[SPEAKER_07]: I bet he has someone to fall off of the balcony in the ghost house in the Haunted Mansion.

1843
02:14:20,076 --> 02:14:21,677
[SPEAKER_07]: That'd be great.

1844
02:14:24,539 --> 02:14:28,202
[SPEAKER_10]: Then that supposed rising elevator will actually collapse.

1845
02:14:29,983 --> 02:14:34,826
[SPEAKER_10]: And then, uh, fuck skin allergies, because they suck.

1846
02:14:35,727 --> 02:14:43,352
[SPEAKER_10]: And fuck every kind of medicine that I've been prescribed to fix it and has it worked, or made it worse, or made it worse.

1847
02:14:44,747 --> 02:15:10,292
[SPEAKER_10]: because it sucks, and uh, figures that I, fuck not being able to figure out everything that I wanted to rant about when I actually get here, because I, this morning, you got it all out in the car, I might have, yes, but uh, but I always think of stuff like on the way, like before I come, even leave to come here, and now I'm like, okay, you can have the microphone when I'm done, Loki, okay, do you have a microphone now, I'm not done yet,

02:15:11,866 --> 02:15:13,027
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, uh, let's see.

02:15:14,208 --> 02:15:18,771
[SPEAKER_10]: Fuck the DDR machine at Tapioca Express in Davis because it's shit now.

1850
02:15:19,951 --> 02:15:23,354
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, it was kinda... It was crap before, but it's shit now.

1851
02:15:24,755 --> 02:15:25,235
[SPEAKER_12]: And, uh...

1852
02:15:27,970 --> 02:15:28,270
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

1853
02:15:29,371 --> 02:15:36,255
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, yeah, I said, uh, fuck Fousey's health drinks, because those gave me really bad diarrhea the past few days.

1854
02:15:39,556 --> 02:15:42,858
[SPEAKER_10]: They taste good, but it doesn't come out the other end very well.

1855
02:15:43,018 --> 02:15:45,460
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you for that information that we didn't need to know.

1856
02:15:45,960 --> 02:15:49,962
[SPEAKER_12]: No, you need to know that, because it can save you from a diarrhea trip.

1857
02:15:53,124 --> 02:15:54,805
[SPEAKER_14]: Who drinks anything like that, really?

1858
02:15:59,670 --> 02:16:03,492
[SPEAKER_12]: But it's fruity and it's colorful and it's healthy.

1859
02:16:06,554 --> 02:16:07,814
[SPEAKER_13]: Please pass the microphone.

1860
02:16:08,615 --> 02:16:08,955
[SPEAKER_14]: No!

1861
02:16:09,475 --> 02:16:11,457
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't feel like passing the microphone yet.

1862
02:16:11,477 --> 02:16:14,018
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, I got one more real quick.

1863
02:16:14,998 --> 02:16:16,159
[SPEAKER_14]: Quiet time, quiet time.

1864
02:16:18,160 --> 02:16:21,222
[SPEAKER_14]: F you to the neighbor upstairs because she's a racist.

1865
02:16:23,991 --> 02:16:28,793
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I was watching my allergies and I saw the Mexicans and they were looking at your tools!

1866
02:16:46,155 --> 02:16:47,055
[SPEAKER_13]: There goes analogy!

1867
02:16:47,195 --> 02:16:50,096
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, I better stay away from that one!

1868
02:16:51,917 --> 02:16:54,118
[SPEAKER_14]: So, she's an evil racist.

1869
02:16:54,238 --> 02:16:55,158
[SPEAKER_14]: I told you she's crazy!

1870
02:16:55,458 --> 02:16:55,858
[SPEAKER_12]: I knew it!

1871
02:16:56,098 --> 02:16:56,759
[SPEAKER_12]: I knew it all along!

1872
02:16:56,779 --> 02:16:58,179
[SPEAKER_12]: She's an evil racist.

1873
02:16:58,299 --> 02:17:01,360
[SPEAKER_12]: What's that with that sign over there, that corner that says Negro Bar?

1874
02:17:02,481 --> 02:17:03,961
[SPEAKER_13]: Mexican stole my stereo.

1875
02:17:04,321 --> 02:17:05,822
[SPEAKER_13]: That's really the name of the bar.

1876
02:17:05,962 --> 02:17:07,902
[SPEAKER_13]: I hate to break it to you, but it really is called that.

1877
02:17:08,142 --> 02:17:10,763
[SPEAKER_13]: It's because it's Spanish for Black Bar.

1878
02:17:11,404 --> 02:17:11,944
[SPEAKER_13]: No way!

1879
02:17:13,924 --> 02:17:15,525
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyway, Bradley...

1880
02:17:17,759 --> 02:17:18,340
[SPEAKER_13]: Bradley's turn.

1881
02:17:19,160 --> 02:17:22,283
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, fuck you to running out of money because I'm almost out now.

1882
02:17:22,984 --> 02:17:33,174
[SPEAKER_13]: And fuck you to the crappy economy and me for taking so long to get to the crappy economy to find maybe a crappy job I have to go just to stay out here.

1883
02:17:34,195 --> 02:17:35,776
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, then talk to them about it later.

1884
02:17:37,598 --> 02:17:38,118
[SPEAKER_13]: It's something good.

1885
02:17:39,159 --> 02:17:42,022
[SPEAKER_13]: It doesn't require too much talking to people because I'll suck at that.

1886
02:17:43,003 --> 02:17:43,964
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, that's good.

1887
02:17:47,498 --> 02:17:51,761
[SPEAKER_13]: See, that's why I couldn't get Bradley a job at Health Net, because I... Oh, shit, I just gave away where I work.

1888
02:17:51,801 --> 02:17:53,181
[SPEAKER_13]: He lives at Death Net.

1889
02:17:53,322 --> 02:17:54,402
[SPEAKER_13]: He's at Death Net.

1890
02:17:54,462 --> 02:17:58,445
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, because most of the people there take calls, so... I don't ever hear you talk.

1891
02:17:58,605 --> 02:17:59,385
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

1892
02:18:11,741 --> 02:18:36,078
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, uh, let's see, fuck you for having my hair being too long, it's getting annoying, time to cut it, but, low money, I can't really go to a barber, I've been, I've cut my hair like twice, I've cut my hair like the last two times, I wonder if anyone noticed, because it probably looked crappy, but, well, it's grown out now, so...

1893
02:18:38,970 --> 02:18:43,773
[SPEAKER_13]: And fuck you to perfume inserts and cologne inserts, I hate smelling that shit all the time.

1894
02:18:44,794 --> 02:18:48,656
[SPEAKER_13]: It comes in the mail, it smells up the mailbox, it smells up everything.

1895
02:18:49,116 --> 02:18:50,037
[SPEAKER_13]: It fills up your mail.

1896
02:18:51,637 --> 02:18:51,898
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

1897
02:18:52,198 --> 02:18:55,320
[SPEAKER_13]: Fuck you to people who wear too much cologne and perfume.

1898
02:18:57,081 --> 02:18:59,782
[SPEAKER_13]: You stunk before you put it on, and then you stunk after.

1899
02:19:00,302 --> 02:19:00,803
[SPEAKER_13]: Even worse.

1900
02:19:03,064 --> 02:19:03,304
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

1901
02:19:06,426 --> 02:19:07,266
[SPEAKER_17]: And... I don't know.

1902
02:19:11,209 --> 02:19:14,012
[SPEAKER_10]: and the general fuck-use to every other crappy thing in the world.

1903
02:19:26,021 --> 02:19:27,002
[SPEAKER_13]: Jobs for everyone.

1904
02:19:27,302 --> 02:19:28,263
[SPEAKER_13]: Jobs for the people.

1905
02:19:29,624 --> 02:19:30,304
[SPEAKER_13]: Bring them down.

1906
02:19:31,105 --> 02:19:32,726
[SPEAKER_13]: Puppy's asking where Brad and Irene are tonight.

1907
02:19:32,786 --> 02:19:37,229
[SPEAKER_13]: Actually, tomorrow is Brad's birthday, and they're celebrating tonight.

1908
02:19:37,970 --> 02:19:41,573
[SPEAKER_13]: Because they're actually coming over for Vanilla Sky tomorrow, believe it or not.

1909
02:19:42,013 --> 02:19:43,054
[SPEAKER_13]: They went to San Francisco today.

1910
02:19:44,935 --> 02:19:46,176
[SPEAKER_13]: Happy birthday, Brad!

1911
02:19:49,098 --> 02:19:52,861
[SPEAKER_13]: I miss a lot of cold winter nights, a lot of birthdays in September, I notice.

1912
02:19:53,602 --> 02:19:53,742
[SPEAKER_13]: Yep.

1913
02:19:56,141 --> 02:19:57,202
[SPEAKER_13]: Did anyone notice that I had one?

1914
02:19:57,322 --> 02:19:58,262
[SPEAKER_13]: When was your birthday?

1915
02:19:59,563 --> 02:20:00,323
[SPEAKER_13]: I won't tell.

1916
02:20:00,343 --> 02:20:00,383
[SPEAKER_13]: Hi.

1917
02:20:00,403 --> 02:20:05,866
[SPEAKER_13]: There's an entry in my live journal that will tell you which day it was.

1918
02:20:06,346 --> 02:20:07,647
[SPEAKER_13]: Because it's a clue.

1919
02:20:10,288 --> 02:20:13,170
[SPEAKER_13]: There's an entry there.

1920
02:20:13,850 --> 02:20:15,391
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, happy birthday whenever it is.

1921
02:20:16,512 --> 02:20:18,733
[SPEAKER_13]: It was early in the month, very early.

1922
02:20:19,653 --> 02:20:21,694
[SPEAKER_13]: It's when I went to the DMV, so you can figure it out from there.

1923
02:20:21,975 --> 02:20:22,535
[SPEAKER_13]: I gotcha.

1924
02:20:22,555 --> 02:20:24,396
[SPEAKER_13]: I had to renew my license that day.

1925
02:20:25,942 --> 02:20:28,343
[SPEAKER_13]: and that was fun waiting for three hours.

1926
02:20:28,563 --> 02:20:32,885
[SPEAKER_13]: At least they didn't charge me for not updating my dress for two years.

1927
02:20:33,125 --> 02:20:40,368
[SPEAKER_13]: Because I feel like I'd get caught without updating your dress, like a $100 fine.

1928
02:20:40,388 --> 02:20:43,990
[SPEAKER_17]: No fine, that's good.

1929
02:20:45,811 --> 02:20:47,572
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, is that everybody in the room that wanted to go?

1930
02:20:48,392 --> 02:20:50,013
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't think Joey wanted to go, so anybody else?

1931
02:20:50,333 --> 02:20:50,573
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

1932
02:20:51,093 --> 02:20:52,754
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's do the chat room if he doesn't.

1933
02:20:52,774 --> 02:20:53,694
[SPEAKER_13]: That is all.

1934
02:20:56,081 --> 02:20:56,421
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

1935
02:20:59,062 --> 02:21:00,042
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's start with the FUs.

1936
02:21:00,822 --> 02:21:06,383
[SPEAKER_13]: 23rd Magus says, FU to the local Papa Murphys for not giving me an interview appointment this weekend.

1937
02:21:06,403 --> 02:21:07,404
[SPEAKER_13]: They said they would.

1938
02:21:07,864 --> 02:21:09,124
[SPEAKER_13]: Show me the motherfucking money.

1939
02:21:09,484 --> 02:21:10,724
[SPEAKER_13]: FU to Angel's work schedule.

1940
02:21:10,744 --> 02:21:11,565
[SPEAKER_13]: This is ridiculous.

1941
02:21:11,765 --> 02:21:13,585
[SPEAKER_13]: FU to slow leveling in Ragnarok Online.

1942
02:21:13,625 --> 02:21:15,826
[SPEAKER_13]: There's got to be a faster way to level up my acolyte, dammit.

1943
02:21:16,886 --> 02:21:17,926
[SPEAKER_13]: Early free... Oh, never mind.

1944
02:21:17,946 --> 02:21:19,266
[SPEAKER_13]: That was a Prime Minister review.

1945
02:21:19,506 --> 02:21:21,507
[SPEAKER_13]: Jamie says she will take you to level up.

1946
02:21:23,263 --> 02:21:27,517
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkTetsuya says, F you to the stupid hick driving the pickup truck full of crap on the way to my girlfriend's.

1947
02:21:27,878 --> 02:21:29,463
[SPEAKER_13]: He must have been doing 20 miles an hour.

1948
02:21:33,291 --> 02:21:55,956
[SPEAKER_13]: Pixie Dust says, F you to work, cutting my hours down to 26, F you to this ugly, bitchy girl that I want to smack so bad, fuck you to gaining weight, hello, I'm already big enough, fuck, fuck, fuck, being so frustrated with money, poop, shit, bloody tampon, oh yeah, fuck, F you to credit, credit is fucking frustrating, damn fucking bills, oh, and F you to rollerblading, being a good workout, it makes me hyperventilate and feel like I'm gonna die, F you to exes,

1950
02:22:16,346 --> 02:22:24,871
[SPEAKER_13]: John Fields says, F you to my rear brake pads dying after only 12,000 miles F you to not having a car this week at school F you to the hurricane that's headed my way, huh?

1951
02:22:27,106 --> 02:22:54,011
[SPEAKER_13]: F you to computers that don't work right from the minute you load the operating system F you to Radio Shack 2 for not having SVGA cables longer than 12 feet I want to use my HDTV 43 inch for my 15 foot away couch as my computer monitor Dolemek says F you to not having two days off in a row F you to not winning megabucks which I'm guessing is a lottery in his state

1952
02:22:55,492 --> 02:22:59,734
[SPEAKER_13]: VidPowa says, F you to nothing in particular and everything in general.

1953
02:23:02,095 --> 02:23:03,116
[SPEAKER_13]: Too vague!

1954
02:23:06,957 --> 02:23:12,540
[SPEAKER_13]: Your buddy and mine, Nostylan says, um, my F you for not having a job and my car being dead.

1955
02:23:14,021 --> 02:23:14,341
[SPEAKER_13]: Sucks.

1956
02:23:17,162 --> 02:23:17,903
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, that's it.

1957
02:23:18,263 --> 02:23:19,543
[SPEAKER_13]: That's all for the F yous of the week.

1958
02:23:20,144 --> 02:23:20,644
[SPEAKER_13]: Finally!

1959
02:23:21,820 --> 02:23:22,680
[SPEAKER_13]: We're going to do a quick break.

1960
02:23:22,700 --> 02:23:23,641
[SPEAKER_13]: We're going to set up for a match game.

1961
02:23:23,661 --> 02:23:24,922
[SPEAKER_13]: Then we're going to come back and do the match game.

1962
02:23:25,322 --> 02:23:27,043
[SPEAKER_13]: In the meantime, I'm going to ask a question.

1963
02:23:27,083 --> 02:23:30,624
[SPEAKER_13]: And the first two people to message me the answer to this question will get to play a match game.

1964
02:23:31,085 --> 02:23:33,006
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a memory retention question.

1965
02:23:33,086 --> 02:23:35,067
[SPEAKER_13]: How well have you been listening to this show?

1966
02:23:36,607 --> 02:23:37,148
[SPEAKER_13]: Here we go.

1967
02:23:40,689 --> 02:23:41,750
[SPEAKER_13]: Not last week.

1968
02:23:41,850 --> 02:23:43,331
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm going to ask a question this week.

1969
02:23:44,251 --> 02:23:47,373
[SPEAKER_13]: The question is... It's an easy question.

1970
02:23:47,433 --> 02:23:48,873
[SPEAKER_13]: If you guys don't get it, you're retarded.

1971
02:23:48,893 --> 02:23:49,734
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, here we go.

1972
02:23:51,189 --> 02:23:55,011
[SPEAKER_13]: What golf land does puppy work at over the summer?

1973
02:23:55,451 --> 02:23:56,211
[SPEAKER_13]: That's the question.

1974
02:23:56,271 --> 02:23:58,993
[SPEAKER_13]: First two people to private message me the answer get to play match game.

1975
02:24:01,554 --> 02:24:01,914
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

1976
02:24:02,654 --> 02:24:08,717
[SPEAKER_13]: And I realize all you are at differing buffers and it's probably not fair for me to ask a question over the radio, but you know what, kids?

1977
02:24:09,077 --> 02:24:09,958
[SPEAKER_13]: Life's not fair.

1978
02:24:12,219 --> 02:24:13,239
[SPEAKER_13]: So deal with it.

1979
02:24:14,620 --> 02:24:18,542
[SPEAKER_13]: In the meantime, a break with a Keyboard Mania song I want to hear.

1980
02:24:18,762 --> 02:24:19,282
[SPEAKER_13]: We'll be back.

1981
02:24:20,811 --> 02:24:21,407
[SPEAKER_13]: with Match Game.

1982
02:26:07,301 --> 02:26:25,138
[SPEAKER_16]: That's right, Joe Strick, Joyce Ward Before there were words, communication was done through teeth Body language is controlled by rhythm Music is a universal link Feel this, feel these Think of this world without sound Can't even feel a heart pound Wasting time, wasting life, wasting self Should've been your health

1983
02:26:36,972 --> 02:26:48,594
I can't hear you, what, what, I can't feel you, what, come on, grow it up, get busy, get busy, that's right, here we go y'all, make music, give me your time and I'll spend it, tell me your name and I'll say it, what is the hell, I'll blow it, last time when I left you, what

1984
02:28:00,752 --> 02:28:01,354
Thanks for watching!

1985
02:28:45,156 --> 02:28:45,762
Thank you.

1986
02:29:35,201 --> 02:29:37,083
[SPEAKER_13]: Welcome back, boys and girls, to Orange Lounge Radio.

1987
02:29:37,103 --> 02:29:38,384
[SPEAKER_13]: We're going to play the match game now.

1988
02:29:38,644 --> 02:29:40,065
[SPEAKER_13]: Let me explain how match game works.

1989
02:29:40,585 --> 02:29:44,208
[SPEAKER_13]: Basically, we're going to ask a question, and then there's a blank somewhere in that question.

1990
02:29:44,228 --> 02:29:45,089
[SPEAKER_13]: We're not really asking a question.

1991
02:29:45,109 --> 02:29:45,749
[SPEAKER_13]: We're saying a sentence.

1992
02:29:45,769 --> 02:29:47,851
[SPEAKER_13]: We're telling a story, and there's a blank in there somewhere.

1993
02:29:48,211 --> 02:29:49,032
[SPEAKER_07]: You need to fill it in.

1994
02:29:50,131 --> 02:29:54,975
[SPEAKER_13]: The contestants will have to fill it in, and for every celebrity they match, they get a point.

1995
02:29:55,375 --> 02:30:01,339
[SPEAKER_13]: So, a lot of you meanies in the chatroom, a lot of people got the answer to the trivia question correct.

1996
02:30:01,379 --> 02:30:03,520
[SPEAKER_13]: Puppy worked at Castro Valley Golf Land over the summer.

1997
02:30:04,301 --> 02:30:08,043
[SPEAKER_13]: And man, when I told you you were too late, you just said, You're an asshole!

1998
02:30:08,263 --> 02:30:09,064
[SPEAKER_13]: No sex for you!

1999
02:30:09,284 --> 02:30:10,025
[SPEAKER_13]: You suck!

2000
02:30:10,285 --> 02:30:11,586
[SPEAKER_13]: I hate you and I hate your show!

2001
02:30:12,386 --> 02:30:13,107
[SPEAKER_13]: Get over it!

2002
02:30:14,147 --> 02:30:16,289
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, I have something to dedicate to all these people, right?

2003
02:30:16,309 --> 02:30:16,489
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

2004
02:30:18,459 --> 02:30:18,999
[SPEAKER_13]: DJ Tyrant, Gas, A SoCal Man

2005
02:30:38,291 --> 02:30:40,313
[SPEAKER_13]: Contestant number two, and this should be interesting.

2006
02:30:40,513 --> 02:30:41,875
[SPEAKER_13]: This is going to be very interesting.

2007
02:30:42,515 --> 02:30:43,236
[SPEAKER_13]: No styling.

2008
02:30:43,256 --> 02:30:45,879
[SPEAKER_13]: This is contestant number two.

2009
02:30:46,840 --> 02:30:49,342
[SPEAKER_13]: So, contestants, you're going to send your answers.

2010
02:30:49,382 --> 02:30:52,986
[SPEAKER_13]: When I ask a question, you send your answers to me over private message in the chat room.

2011
02:30:53,849 --> 02:30:55,570
[SPEAKER_13]: So, this should be interesting.

2012
02:30:56,390 --> 02:30:59,992
[SPEAKER_13]: And Pixie Dust, 23rd Magus, Starktitsu, yeah, they all got it right.

2013
02:31:00,072 --> 02:31:00,672
[SPEAKER_13]: Just a little late.

2014
02:31:00,812 --> 02:31:01,312
[SPEAKER_13]: Sorry, kids.

2015
02:31:02,633 --> 02:31:02,913
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

2016
02:31:04,153 --> 02:31:05,594
[SPEAKER_13]: Tyrant, this will be easy.

2017
02:31:05,914 --> 02:31:08,375
[SPEAKER_13]: This will be easy for you, I'm telling you.

2018
02:31:08,755 --> 02:31:09,476
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm so rude.

2019
02:31:10,356 --> 02:31:10,836
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm so rude.

2020
02:31:11,236 --> 02:31:13,137
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, maybe we ought to give Nostelon a handicap.

2021
02:31:13,197 --> 02:31:13,537
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know.

2022
02:31:13,557 --> 02:31:16,218
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

2023
02:31:16,258 --> 02:31:17,159
[SPEAKER_13]: All right, no, we're not going to do that.

2024
02:31:17,179 --> 02:31:17,519
[SPEAKER_13]: Here we go.

2025
02:31:19,040 --> 02:31:20,700
[SPEAKER_13]: And Marin was close.

2026
02:31:20,740 --> 02:31:21,881
[SPEAKER_13]: She said, not Roseville.

2027
02:31:23,735 --> 02:31:26,356
[SPEAKER_13]: But she was still the third person anyway.

2028
02:31:26,436 --> 02:31:29,457
[SPEAKER_13]: She would have had it right if she said CBGL.

2029
02:31:30,818 --> 02:31:31,578
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, you know what?

2030
02:31:31,618 --> 02:31:35,419
[SPEAKER_13]: But she gets to listen and know that she inspired this wonderful segment tonight.

2031
02:31:36,200 --> 02:31:38,501
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe we should have an honorable third party.

2032
02:31:40,081 --> 02:31:41,162
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe we're running out of time.

2033
02:31:41,222 --> 02:31:44,363
[SPEAKER_13]: Here we go.

2034
02:31:45,743 --> 02:31:46,724
[SPEAKER_13]: As much as I love Marin.

2035
02:31:48,304 --> 02:31:48,965
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, here we go.

2036
02:31:49,065 --> 02:31:49,965
[SPEAKER_13]: Question number one.

2037
02:31:52,208 --> 02:31:58,773
[SPEAKER_13]: One day, Betty the Bomani Addict... Joey, those are the music games.

2038
02:32:00,113 --> 02:32:01,434
[SPEAKER_13]: Everybody, by the way, is playing tonight.

2039
02:32:01,474 --> 02:32:02,675
[SPEAKER_13]: Everybody is a celebrity here tonight.

2040
02:32:03,636 --> 02:32:07,058
[SPEAKER_13]: Betty the Bomani Addict decided she was tired of playing Beatmania.

2041
02:32:07,738 --> 02:32:10,320
[SPEAKER_13]: Instead, she decided to try the new Bomani game.

2042
02:32:10,760 --> 02:32:11,141
[SPEAKER_13]: Blank!

2043
02:32:12,181 --> 02:32:15,824
[SPEAKER_13]: Jamie wrote all of tonight's questions, by the way, so if you don't like a question, blame her.

2044
02:32:18,257 --> 02:32:21,998
[SPEAKER_13]: Betty, the Bomani addict, decided she was tired of playing Beatmania.

2045
02:32:22,098 --> 02:32:26,240
[SPEAKER_13]: Instead, she decided to try the new Bomani game, Blank.

2046
02:32:38,563 --> 02:32:40,504
[SPEAKER_13]: The contestants are thinking.

2047
02:32:41,824 --> 02:32:43,645
[SPEAKER_13]: I have one contestant locked in with their answer.

2048
02:32:46,600 --> 02:32:47,920
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think that's both contestants.

2049
02:32:47,980 --> 02:32:51,021
[SPEAKER_13]: Let me just verify they did submit answers and not questions like, huh?

2050
02:32:52,021 --> 02:32:52,741
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, there's one.

2051
02:32:52,941 --> 02:32:53,421
[SPEAKER_13]: I got a huh.

2052
02:32:53,441 --> 02:32:54,001
[SPEAKER_13]: Give me a sec.

2053
02:32:57,402 --> 02:32:58,382
[SPEAKER_07]: I need another pen.

2054
02:33:02,443 --> 02:33:02,743
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

2055
02:33:05,104 --> 02:33:06,304
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, I have both answers.

2056
02:33:09,704 --> 02:33:10,725
[SPEAKER_13]: Are all the celebrities ready?

2057
02:33:11,565 --> 02:33:12,065
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, here we go.

2058
02:33:13,223 --> 02:33:16,404
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, let's see what you guys put.

2059
02:33:16,424 --> 02:33:18,805
[SPEAKER_13]: You want to do the contestants first?

2060
02:33:18,905 --> 02:33:19,886
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's do the contestants first.

2061
02:33:19,906 --> 02:33:20,546
[SPEAKER_13]: This is the way the show did it.

2062
02:33:21,246 --> 02:33:21,486
[SPEAKER_13]: What?

2063
02:33:23,227 --> 02:33:26,368
[SPEAKER_13]: What do you mean, just in case?

2064
02:33:31,470 --> 02:33:31,951
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't care.

2065
02:33:32,371 --> 02:33:32,691
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't care.

2066
02:33:33,131 --> 02:33:40,294
[SPEAKER_13]: Tyron says... Instead, she decided to try the new Bomani game, Marshall Beat.

2067
02:33:41,991 --> 02:33:45,293
[SPEAKER_13]: That's not a new Bomani game, but that's what he said, so there it is.

2068
02:33:46,553 --> 02:33:48,094
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe it's new at the arcade, I don't know.

2069
02:33:50,055 --> 02:33:57,819
[SPEAKER_13]: Nostylan says, Nostylan says, Betty decided to try the new Bomani game, DDR beat their meat.

2070
02:34:02,342 --> 02:34:04,963
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, let's see.

2071
02:34:07,284 --> 02:34:10,226
[SPEAKER_13]: Loki, your answer was, he decided to try the new Bomani game.

2072
02:34:11,297 --> 02:34:12,417
[SPEAKER_13]: Marshall Beat Off.

2073
02:34:14,158 --> 02:34:15,158
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, so close.

2074
02:34:15,178 --> 02:34:18,059
[SPEAKER_13]: Do you think that's a... Can I give them both a point?

2075
02:34:18,079 --> 02:34:18,619
[SPEAKER_12]: You know what?

2076
02:34:18,639 --> 02:34:21,300
[SPEAKER_13]: Because Tyrant put Marshall Beat in all caps.

2077
02:34:22,780 --> 02:34:25,181
[SPEAKER_13]: Beat is in caps, so the emphasis was on the beat.

2078
02:34:25,201 --> 02:34:25,781
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

2079
02:34:25,801 --> 02:34:26,941
[SPEAKER_13]: Do you want to give them both a point?

2080
02:34:27,081 --> 02:34:27,721
[SPEAKER_13]: Give them both a point.

2081
02:34:28,261 --> 02:34:30,402
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, so they both get a point for that because they're both kind of close.

2082
02:34:30,462 --> 02:34:30,682
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

2083
02:34:31,402 --> 02:34:33,363
[SPEAKER_13]: A point for Tyrant and a point for No Sound.

2084
02:34:33,663 --> 02:34:34,663
[SPEAKER_13]: This is amazing.

2085
02:34:35,023 --> 02:34:37,003
[SPEAKER_13]: Most number of points scored in the game ever.

2086
02:34:37,604 --> 02:34:38,744
[SPEAKER_07]: We had a two-point game once.

2087
02:34:39,335 --> 02:34:43,136
[SPEAKER_13]: My answer was they decided to play Sarsvania.

2088
02:34:44,777 --> 02:34:45,797
[SPEAKER_13]: Not a match, sorry.

2089
02:34:46,677 --> 02:34:58,941
[SPEAKER_13]: Now Joey, this should be fun because Joey got to see DDR, well Joey actually got introduced to the whole DDR obsession of ours this weekend, so he's still kind of catching up on all the inside jokes, so this should be great.

2090
02:35:01,041 --> 02:35:03,702
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, well the answer that I picked was Beat Me Down.

2091
02:35:05,609 --> 02:35:07,190
[SPEAKER_13]: Beat Me Down Puppy Spoon Freaks

2092
02:35:30,280 --> 02:35:32,121
[SPEAKER_13]: I said, forehead smacking mania.

2093
02:35:32,541 --> 02:35:34,042
[SPEAKER_13]: Forehead smacking mania.

2094
02:35:34,202 --> 02:35:34,982
[SPEAKER_13]: Fun, but no.

2095
02:35:36,003 --> 02:35:36,483
[SPEAKER_13]: Punk Knight.

2096
02:35:37,063 --> 02:35:38,184
[SPEAKER_13]: I'd kick a baby mania.

2097
02:35:38,284 --> 02:35:39,825
[SPEAKER_13]: Kick a baby mania.

2098
02:35:40,805 --> 02:35:41,505
[SPEAKER_13]: Wonderful.

2099
02:35:41,625 --> 02:35:42,906
[SPEAKER_13]: However, not a match.

2100
02:35:43,967 --> 02:35:46,107
[SPEAKER_13]: So, after the first round, it's all tied up one to one.

2101
02:35:46,168 --> 02:35:47,068
[SPEAKER_13]: Five questions to go.

2102
02:35:47,948 --> 02:35:48,469
[SPEAKER_13]: You guys ready?

2103
02:35:48,609 --> 02:35:49,429
[SPEAKER_13]: Here's question number two.

2104
02:35:53,031 --> 02:35:55,732
[SPEAKER_13]: Sally the Shopaholic was so excited...

2105
02:35:56,977 --> 02:36:00,519
[SPEAKER_13]: The Outlet Mall had a new store that sold nothing but blank.

2106
02:36:02,980 --> 02:36:05,021
[SPEAKER_13]: Sally the Shopaholic was so excited.

2107
02:36:06,082 --> 02:36:08,783
[SPEAKER_13]: The Outlet Mall had a new store that sold nothing but blank.

2108
02:36:24,039 --> 02:36:27,903
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm just waiting on the chat room, or waiting on our contestants to answer this question.

2109
02:36:29,584 --> 02:36:31,646
[SPEAKER_13]: Sally the Shopaholic was so excited!

2110
02:36:32,707 --> 02:36:35,369
[SPEAKER_13]: The Outlet Mall had a new store that sold nothing but blank.

2111
02:36:40,694 --> 02:36:42,896
[SPEAKER_13]: I have one contestant.

2112
02:36:43,537 --> 02:36:44,498
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm just waiting on the other one.

2113
02:36:57,910 --> 02:36:58,310
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

2114
02:37:01,331 --> 02:37:03,091
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, I got both the answers.

2115
02:37:03,572 --> 02:37:04,332
[SPEAKER_13]: All right, here we go.

2116
02:37:04,392 --> 02:37:07,173
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's read the... All the celebrities are done, right?

2117
02:37:07,233 --> 02:37:07,653
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, okay.

2118
02:37:07,673 --> 02:37:08,013
[SPEAKER_13]: Here we go.

2119
02:37:09,953 --> 02:37:11,874
[SPEAKER_13]: Sally the Shopaholic was so excited.

2120
02:37:11,894 --> 02:37:15,355
[SPEAKER_13]: The Outlet Mall had a new store that sold nothing but... No styling said...

2121
02:37:16,345 --> 02:37:17,306
[SPEAKER_13]: Flick-a-nick Dickie.

2122
02:37:23,569 --> 02:37:24,529
[SPEAKER_13]: Flick-a-nick Dickie.

2123
02:37:24,950 --> 02:37:29,092
[SPEAKER_13]: Tyrant says, had a new store that sold nothing but F-Zero GX.

2124
02:37:29,812 --> 02:37:30,192
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

2125
02:37:30,553 --> 02:37:33,054
[SPEAKER_13]: This wasn't Rob, it was Sally, but close, okay.

2126
02:37:33,554 --> 02:37:34,855
[SPEAKER_13]: We'll see though, we'll see, you never know.

2127
02:37:35,235 --> 02:37:37,977
[SPEAKER_13]: Flick-a-nick Dickie, I don't know, I was thinking about that one.

2128
02:37:38,557 --> 02:37:40,218
[SPEAKER_06]: Somehow I don't think it's going to match.

2129
02:37:41,478 --> 02:37:44,080
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know if it's going to match, but I said Cuban immigrants.

2130
02:37:47,583 --> 02:37:49,765
[SPEAKER_13]: A store that sold nothing but Cuban immigrants.

2131
02:37:49,905 --> 02:37:51,206
[SPEAKER_13]: No, not a match, unfortunately.

2132
02:37:53,047 --> 02:37:57,510
[SPEAKER_13]: I put Sally the Shopaholic was so excited there was a store that sold nothing but babies.

2133
02:37:58,431 --> 02:38:00,112
[SPEAKER_13]: Babies, not a match, sorry.

2134
02:38:00,812 --> 02:38:01,213
[SPEAKER_13]: Joey.

2135
02:38:02,353 --> 02:38:02,874
[SPEAKER_13]: Panties?

2136
02:38:04,295 --> 02:38:04,755
[SPEAKER_13]: Panties?

2137
02:38:06,356 --> 02:38:13,401
[SPEAKER_13]: Panties, although I think flick-a-nick-dicky might be a term for panties, I'm not sure and I can't look it up, so you lose.

2138
02:38:13,421 --> 02:38:13,721
[SPEAKER_13]: No points.

2139
02:38:14,062 --> 02:38:14,402
[SPEAKER_13]: No points.

2140
02:38:17,168 --> 02:38:18,069
[SPEAKER_13]: All right, going on.

2141
02:38:18,469 --> 02:38:18,730
[SPEAKER_13]: Puppy.

2142
02:38:19,030 --> 02:38:19,771
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, I'm sorry, Jamie.

2143
02:38:20,271 --> 02:38:20,772
[SPEAKER_07]: Propel.

2144
02:38:21,292 --> 02:38:22,734
[SPEAKER_13]: Propel, there you go.

2145
02:38:23,054 --> 02:38:25,877
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I usually expect people to pick Propel when I'm playing.

2146
02:38:25,917 --> 02:38:26,517
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, well.

2147
02:38:26,878 --> 02:38:28,379
[SPEAKER_07]: And no stupid.

2148
02:38:28,479 --> 02:38:29,921
[SPEAKER_13]: We have new contestants tonight.

2149
02:38:29,961 --> 02:38:30,481
[SPEAKER_13]: Give them a break.

2150
02:38:31,022 --> 02:38:31,322
[SPEAKER_13]: Puppy.

2151
02:38:33,124 --> 02:38:35,226
[SPEAKER_13]: I say Defective Condoms.

2152
02:38:35,567 --> 02:38:36,888
[SPEAKER_13]: Defective Condoms.

2153
02:38:37,629 --> 02:38:38,249
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, nice.

2154
02:38:38,690 --> 02:38:40,732
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know how a store would stay open so I'm not, but okay.

2155
02:38:42,562 --> 02:38:44,483
[SPEAKER_13]: My answer is Detached Eyeballs.

2156
02:38:44,903 --> 02:38:46,944
[SPEAKER_13]: My answer was Down Syndrome Porn.

2157
02:38:47,004 --> 02:38:49,886
[SPEAKER_13]: Wow, I'm so glad we let him go last.

2158
02:39:06,431 --> 02:39:07,391
[SPEAKER_13]: Miyako was so depressed.

2159
02:39:07,411 --> 02:39:12,653
[SPEAKER_13]: She had been drugged and pulled into an island with her classmates to do Battle Royale.

2160
02:39:12,673 --> 02:39:16,073
[SPEAKER_13]: And the weapon she was given was a blank.

2161
02:39:32,526 --> 02:39:39,450
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, she'd been drugged and pulled to the island with her classmates to do Battle Royale and the weapon she was given was a blank.

2162
02:39:54,600 --> 02:39:58,022
[SPEAKER_13]: We're just waiting for the contestants to answer and waiting for all the celebrities to lock in their vote.

2163
02:39:58,857 --> 02:40:04,822
[SPEAKER_13]: Miyako was so depressed, she got drugged, pulled to the island with her classmates to Battle Royale, and the weapon she was given was a blank.

2164
02:40:24,637 --> 02:40:26,158
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, let's see, well we have music going.

2165
02:40:30,413 --> 02:40:33,375
[SPEAKER_13]: Vidpala says a cassette tape of old Orange Lounge episodes.

2166
02:40:33,415 --> 02:40:34,496
[SPEAKER_13]: That's lovely, thank you.

2167
02:40:34,977 --> 02:40:36,318
[SPEAKER_13]: It's kind of close to what I put, though.

2168
02:40:39,560 --> 02:40:40,441
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, here we go.

2169
02:40:42,002 --> 02:40:43,664
[SPEAKER_13]: All right, we have the contestants logged in.

2170
02:40:43,704 --> 02:40:44,724
[SPEAKER_13]: Starting off with Tyrant.

2171
02:40:45,945 --> 02:40:49,528
[SPEAKER_13]: Miyako was so depressed she got drugged and pulled to the island with her classmates to do Battle Royale.

2172
02:40:49,548 --> 02:40:51,890
[SPEAKER_13]: The weapon she was given was, Tyrant says, a trout.

2173
02:40:52,611 --> 02:40:53,632
[SPEAKER_13]: Like IRC, get it?

2174
02:40:53,672 --> 02:40:54,192
[SPEAKER_13]: A trout.

2175
02:40:54,712 --> 02:40:55,273
[SPEAKER_13]: Ha, ha, ha.

2176
02:40:55,353 --> 02:40:56,334
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, that was a cute answer.

2177
02:40:56,354 --> 02:40:56,834
[SPEAKER_13]: I like that.

2178
02:40:57,455 --> 02:40:57,755
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

2179
02:40:59,202 --> 02:41:03,827
[SPEAKER_13]: Nostyla says the weapon she was given was a magic kicky dicky in the Nikki.

2180
02:41:08,672 --> 02:41:10,094
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, Nikki, please, not so quicky.

2181
02:41:10,534 --> 02:41:10,835
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

2182
02:41:11,936 --> 02:41:12,296
[SPEAKER_13]: Wow.

2183
02:41:14,198 --> 02:41:15,820
[SPEAKER_13]: Loki, your answer, please.

2184
02:41:17,381 --> 02:41:18,062
[SPEAKER_13]: Three words.

2185
02:41:19,043 --> 02:41:20,505
[SPEAKER_13]: Iraqi suicide babies.

2186
02:41:23,217 --> 02:41:23,517
[SPEAKER_13]: Awesome.

2187
02:41:23,557 --> 02:41:25,519
[SPEAKER_13]: Anybody that used to listen to this show would get that joke.

2188
02:41:25,979 --> 02:41:30,983
[SPEAKER_13]: I said the weapon she was given was a bad joke book authored by 23rd Magus.

2189
02:41:31,203 --> 02:41:31,784
[SPEAKER_13]: Not a match.

2190
02:41:31,884 --> 02:41:32,244
[SPEAKER_13]: Sorry.

2191
02:41:32,304 --> 02:41:33,385
[SPEAKER_06]: No, she'd win.

2192
02:41:33,985 --> 02:41:34,486
[SPEAKER_06]: She'd win.

2193
02:41:35,627 --> 02:41:36,787
[SPEAKER_13]: I just, I'm going to get killed.

2194
02:41:39,550 --> 02:41:39,970
[SPEAKER_11]: Joey.

2195
02:41:42,111 --> 02:41:44,313
[SPEAKER_11]: A multi-purpose magic banana.

2196
02:41:46,415 --> 02:41:47,916
[SPEAKER_13]: A multi-purpose magic banana.

2197
02:41:47,936 --> 02:41:51,699
[SPEAKER_07]: She probably would be too preoccupied with that and get caught in a danger zone and her collar would explode.

2198
02:41:53,623 --> 02:41:55,764
[SPEAKER_07]: Mine was a Yoko Ono CD and a CD player.

2199
02:41:56,464 --> 02:41:57,245
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, very nice.

2200
02:41:57,525 --> 02:41:59,726
[SPEAKER_13]: There's a lot of this theme of, like, hearing things.

2201
02:41:59,946 --> 02:42:06,969
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, if you think about it, though, with the collar, it'd be worth explosive orgasm.

2202
02:42:10,030 --> 02:42:14,572
[SPEAKER_10]: I said... A 50-foot dildo.

2203
02:42:15,512 --> 02:42:16,993
[SPEAKER_10]: I actually said a spike dildo.

2204
02:42:17,453 --> 02:42:18,433
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, a spike dildo.

2205
02:42:18,693 --> 02:42:19,133
[SPEAKER_13]: Not a match.

2206
02:42:20,034 --> 02:42:20,454
[SPEAKER_13]: Gladly.

2207
02:42:21,701 --> 02:42:22,602
[SPEAKER_13]: But nail clippers.

2208
02:42:23,282 --> 02:42:24,143
[SPEAKER_13]: Nail clippers!

2209
02:42:24,923 --> 02:42:27,005
[SPEAKER_13]: So she can keep good hygiene, but not a match.

2210
02:42:28,406 --> 02:42:29,247
[SPEAKER_13]: A monkey launcher.

2211
02:42:29,827 --> 02:42:30,227
[SPEAKER_12]: What?

2212
02:42:31,388 --> 02:42:32,289
[SPEAKER_12]: A monkey launcher.

2213
02:42:32,389 --> 02:42:33,930
[SPEAKER_13]: A monkey launcher, lovely.

2214
02:42:34,731 --> 02:42:35,131
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright.

2215
02:42:39,254 --> 02:42:42,697
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, so not a match for either contestant, sorry.

2216
02:42:42,737 --> 02:42:43,117
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm tired.

2217
02:42:45,616 --> 02:42:51,738
[SPEAKER_07]: No, in the book, they have different weapons than in the movie, and someone got a sticky dart gun.

2218
02:42:52,098 --> 02:42:55,578
[SPEAKER_07]: No, got a dart board and darts as their weapon.

2219
02:42:56,939 --> 02:42:57,759
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

2220
02:42:57,899 --> 02:42:58,579
[SPEAKER_13]: Moving on, here we go.

2221
02:43:00,059 --> 02:43:00,660
[SPEAKER_13]: Still one apiece.

2222
02:43:01,180 --> 02:43:05,661
[SPEAKER_13]: Francine, the fanfic writer, was getting impatient for the next Harry Potter book.

2223
02:43:06,681 --> 02:43:08,682
[SPEAKER_13]: So she decided to write it herself.

2224
02:43:09,102 --> 02:43:10,502
[SPEAKER_13]: But she couldn't think of a good name.

2225
02:43:11,536 --> 02:43:15,099
[SPEAKER_12]: Finally, she decided to name it Harry Potter and the Blank.

2226
02:43:27,190 --> 02:43:31,554
[SPEAKER_13]: Francine, the fanfic writer, was getting impatient for the next Harry Potter book, so she decided to write it herself.

2227
02:43:32,094 --> 02:43:33,235
[SPEAKER_13]: But she couldn't think of a good name.

2228
02:43:33,776 --> 02:43:37,279
[SPEAKER_13]: Finally, she decided to call it and name it Harry Potter and the Blank.

2229
02:43:40,858 --> 02:43:46,603
[SPEAKER_17]: Tell Buck I know.

2230
02:43:46,623 --> 02:43:49,405
[SPEAKER_17]: She decided to name it Harry Potter and the blank.

2231
02:44:15,494 --> 02:44:17,995
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm just waiting for both contestants to lock in with an answer here.

2232
02:44:18,095 --> 02:44:20,796
[SPEAKER_13]: Finally, she decided to name it Harry Potter in the blank.

2233
02:44:22,857 --> 02:44:23,517
[SPEAKER_13]: I need an answer too.

2234
02:44:34,437 --> 02:44:34,797
[SPEAKER_17]: All right.

2235
02:44:41,760 --> 02:44:42,520
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, here we go.

2236
02:44:42,560 --> 02:44:42,800
[SPEAKER_13]: Ready?

2237
02:44:43,100 --> 02:44:43,621
[SPEAKER_06]: Are we all ready?

2238
02:44:43,901 --> 02:44:44,121
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

2239
02:44:44,141 --> 02:44:44,941
[SPEAKER_06]: Ding, ding.

2240
02:44:45,601 --> 02:44:46,101
[SPEAKER_13]: Everybody's dinged.

2241
02:44:46,121 --> 02:44:46,382
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

2242
02:44:46,442 --> 02:44:53,604
[SPEAKER_13]: Nostylan says... She decided to call it Harry Potter Gone Wild with a Bomb in a Can of Some Sort.

2243
02:44:55,245 --> 02:44:55,825
Okay.

2244
02:44:56,525 --> 02:44:59,687
[SPEAKER_13]: DJ Tyrant says, Harry Potter and a Breast Implant.

2245
02:45:02,468 --> 02:45:02,808
[SPEAKER_13]: Loki...

2246
02:45:04,022 --> 02:45:04,642
[SPEAKER_13]: See if we get a match.

2247
02:45:06,143 --> 02:45:07,223
[SPEAKER_14]: Damn, I have like two.

2248
02:45:09,204 --> 02:45:11,284
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, since they're both not matching anyways.

2249
02:45:11,324 --> 02:45:18,207
[SPEAKER_14]: Harry Potter and the Horny Catholic Priest or Harry Potter and the Sex Change.

2250
02:45:19,487 --> 02:45:20,908
[SPEAKER_14]: But I like Horny Catholic Priest better.

2251
02:45:20,988 --> 02:45:23,408
[SPEAKER_13]: The sex change would be kind of close.

2252
02:45:23,609 --> 02:45:24,569
[SPEAKER_13]: That would be like a half point.

2253
02:45:25,441 --> 02:45:28,582
[SPEAKER_13]: Bohorny Catholic Priest was your first pick.

2254
02:45:29,142 --> 02:45:33,502
[SPEAKER_13]: I was kind of stretched for an answer, so I used a good classic inside joke.

2255
02:45:34,163 --> 02:45:36,243
[SPEAKER_13]: I said Harry Potter and the Stars Infested Monkeys.

2256
02:45:38,923 --> 02:45:39,183
[SPEAKER_11]: Joey?

2257
02:45:40,924 --> 02:45:43,144
[SPEAKER_11]: Harry Potter and the Search for Sexual Release.

2258
02:45:45,184 --> 02:45:45,705
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice.

2259
02:45:46,505 --> 02:45:46,825
[SPEAKER_11]: Jamie?

2260
02:45:47,485 --> 02:45:54,186
[SPEAKER_07]: I said, and people who actually are fans of the book would get it, and it also fits in with the show, Harry Potter and the Magical Bouncing Ferret.

2261
02:46:05,797 --> 02:46:23,064
[SPEAKER_13]: Harry Potter and the Swedish Furniture Harry Potter and the Swedish Furniture, good answer, but not a match Harry Potter and the Puss Filled Acne of Doom Appropriate, but not a match Punk Night Harry Potter and the Pile of Dead Babies

2262
02:46:25,458 --> 02:46:27,019
[SPEAKER_13]: Not a match, I'm so sorry.

2263
02:46:29,120 --> 02:46:31,181
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, here we go, two more questions to go.

2264
02:46:31,221 --> 02:46:32,942
[SPEAKER_13]: Will they break the tie of one to one?

2265
02:46:33,002 --> 02:46:34,723
[SPEAKER_13]: Probably not, but let's keep playing anyway.

2266
02:46:34,763 --> 02:46:35,223
[SPEAKER_13]: Here we go.

2267
02:46:38,104 --> 02:46:43,707
[SPEAKER_13]: Perry the Painter was working on his new masterpiece and ran out of a few of his paints.

2268
02:46:44,627 --> 02:46:49,270
[SPEAKER_13]: He was almost done, so to replace the missing paints he used blank.

2269
02:46:52,236 --> 02:46:55,998
[SPEAKER_13]: Perry the Painter was working on his new masterpiece and he ran out of a few of his paints.

2270
02:46:56,619 --> 02:47:00,361
[SPEAKER_13]: He was almost done, so to replace the missing paints he used blank.

2271
02:47:17,230 --> 02:47:19,452
[SPEAKER_13]: The contestants are thinking about their answers.

2272
02:47:22,287 --> 02:47:24,689
[SPEAKER_13]: The celebrities are thinking about their answers.

2273
02:47:27,031 --> 02:47:28,492
[SPEAKER_13]: Here's the question one more time.

2274
02:47:29,492 --> 02:47:33,595
[SPEAKER_13]: Perry the Painter was working on his new masterpiece and ran out of a few of his paints.

2275
02:47:34,236 --> 02:47:38,039
[SPEAKER_13]: He was almost done, so to replace the missing paints, he used blank.

2276
02:47:40,801 --> 02:47:42,042
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm waiting on both contestants.

2277
02:47:43,342 --> 02:47:44,543
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, looks like we might have one.

2278
02:47:46,245 --> 02:47:46,945
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, that's lovely.

2279
02:47:47,245 --> 02:47:47,946
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, we have one.

2280
02:47:51,344 --> 02:47:53,406
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'm waiting on one more.

2281
02:47:53,426 --> 02:48:01,231
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, I think we have it.

2282
02:48:01,271 --> 02:48:01,771
[SPEAKER_13]: Let me check.

2283
02:48:04,773 --> 02:48:05,173
[SPEAKER_13]: Beautiful.

2284
02:48:05,714 --> 02:48:06,454
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, here we go.

2285
02:48:07,315 --> 02:48:08,636
[SPEAKER_13]: Whose answer do you guys want to hear first?

2286
02:48:08,756 --> 02:48:09,656
[SPEAKER_13]: Tyrants or no stylings?

2287
02:48:10,877 --> 02:48:11,257
[SPEAKER_13]: Tyrant!

2288
02:48:11,517 --> 02:48:11,918
[SPEAKER_13]: Tyrant!

2289
02:48:13,399 --> 02:48:17,101
[SPEAKER_13]: Tyrant said Perry the Painter was working on his new masterpiece and ran out of a few of his paints.

2290
02:48:17,141 --> 02:48:19,743
[SPEAKER_13]: He was almost done, so to replace the missing paints he used...

2291
02:48:20,757 --> 02:48:21,858
[SPEAKER_13]: Puss from Zitz.

2292
02:48:26,420 --> 02:48:33,364
[SPEAKER_13]: NoStylin says, to replace the paints he used the jizz and then afterwards decided to fap to some Orange Lounge Radio.

2293
02:48:34,625 --> 02:48:34,985
[SPEAKER_06]: Aww.

2294
02:48:35,005 --> 02:48:35,685
[SPEAKER_06]: Aww, how lovely.

2295
02:48:35,705 --> 02:48:36,806
[SPEAKER_06]: Way to show your love.

2296
02:48:37,406 --> 02:48:39,047
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, uh, Loki.

2297
02:48:41,549 --> 02:48:43,850
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, he used Club Baby Seals.

2298
02:48:48,385 --> 02:48:49,245
[SPEAKER_13]: Nice, but not a match.

2299
02:48:50,426 --> 02:48:53,306
[SPEAKER_13]: I said he ran out of paint, so he decided to use skin.

2300
02:48:54,046 --> 02:48:54,426
[SPEAKER_13]: Not a match.

2301
02:48:56,287 --> 02:48:57,007
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm just being morbid.

2302
02:48:59,168 --> 02:49:02,028
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, I was going to use jizz myself, but then I decided to just use blood.

2303
02:49:03,989 --> 02:49:04,689
[SPEAKER_13]: So simple.

2304
02:49:04,909 --> 02:49:05,369
[SPEAKER_13]: Not a match.

2305
02:49:05,629 --> 02:49:06,009
[SPEAKER_13]: Jamie.

2306
02:49:06,329 --> 02:49:06,829
[SPEAKER_13]: Phlegm.

2307
02:49:07,390 --> 02:49:08,250
[SPEAKER_13]: Phlegm.

2308
02:49:08,430 --> 02:49:09,870
[SPEAKER_13]: Also a simple answer, but not a match.

2309
02:49:10,150 --> 02:49:10,490

02:49:15,431 --> 02:49:16,112
[SPEAKER_13]: Beautiful answer.

2313
02:49:16,152 --> 02:49:16,492
[SPEAKER_13]: Not a match.

2314
02:49:17,332 --> 02:49:17,672
[SPEAKER_13]: Bradley.

2315
02:49:19,036 --> 02:49:21,757
[SPEAKER_13]: I used the dog rotting on his doorstep.

2316
02:49:22,077 --> 02:49:23,938
[SPEAKER_13]: The dog rotting on his doorstep.

2317
02:49:24,018 --> 02:49:24,378
[SPEAKER_13]: Lovely.

2318
02:49:24,438 --> 02:49:24,798
[SPEAKER_13]: Not a match.

2319
02:49:25,679 --> 02:49:26,699
[SPEAKER_13]: Punk Night, dare I ask.

2320
02:49:29,120 --> 02:49:30,501
[SPEAKER_13]: Oblimic person's vomit.

2321
02:49:31,921 --> 02:49:33,522
[SPEAKER_13]: Oblimic person's vomit.

2322
02:49:33,542 --> 02:49:36,403
[SPEAKER_13]: I would have a lot of colors.

2323
02:49:36,423 --> 02:49:37,204
[SPEAKER_13]: Colorful, not a match.

2324
02:49:38,324 --> 02:49:38,764
[SPEAKER_13]: Wow.

2325
02:49:40,025 --> 02:49:40,845
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're on the last one.

2326
02:49:46,968 --> 02:49:47,328
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

2327
02:49:48,666 --> 02:49:50,067
[SPEAKER_13]: Here we go, last question.

2328
02:49:50,107 --> 02:49:54,429
[SPEAKER_13]: This is your last chance to get a point, otherwise we're going to have a tie, and nobody likes a tie.

2329
02:49:56,590 --> 02:49:58,351
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, here's a question.

2330
02:50:00,612 --> 02:50:05,534
[SPEAKER_13]: Kelly was tired of staying at home all day, so she decided that she would leave.

2331
02:50:06,715 --> 02:50:10,737
[SPEAKER_13]: She hopped in her car and decided that she was going to go on a road trip to blank.

2332
02:50:13,058 --> 02:50:15,199
[SPEAKER_13]: All questions for this evening written by DarkSakura.

2337
02:50:48,659 --> 02:50:50,920
[SPEAKER_13]: You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio's Match Game.

2338
02:50:54,243 --> 02:50:58,626
[SPEAKER_13]: The question is... Kelly was tired of staying home all day, so she decided that she would leave.

2339
02:50:58,686 --> 02:51:01,708
[SPEAKER_13]: She hopped in her car and decided that she was going to go on a road trip to blank.

[SPEAKER_13]: I know, his answers are so creative.

2345
02:51:17,188 --> 02:51:18,269
[SPEAKER_13]: I guess we have to give them time.

2346
02:51:18,329 --> 02:51:19,609
[SPEAKER_13]: Such creativity takes time.

2347
02:51:31,328 --> 02:51:31,708

[SPEAKER_07]: Hurry up, Nostylin.

2354
02:52:06,392 --> 02:52:08,693
[SPEAKER_07]: Or I'll beat you with a ferret until you die.

2355
02:52:11,253 --> 02:52:12,473
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, no frowny faces.

2356
02:52:12,493 --> 02:52:14,754
[SPEAKER_13]: Perhaps I need to read the question one more time.

2362
02:52:26,328 --> 02:52:26,628
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

2363
02:52:28,409 --> 02:52:30,570
[SPEAKER_13]: And let's hear what No Silent's answer is.

2364
02:52:32,590 --> 02:52:38,713
[SPEAKER_13]: Kelly hopped in the car and decided she was going on a road trip to the famous SARS land that was provided by BACA.

2365
02:52:40,916 --> 02:52:43,458
[SPEAKER_13]: being another one of our chat regulars, trying to take a slam on Baka there.

2366
02:52:44,059 --> 02:52:45,480
[SPEAKER_13]: Lovely answer, we'll see if it's a match.

2367
02:52:46,441 --> 02:52:51,225
[SPEAKER_13]: DJ Tyrant says, she decided to take a road trip to Castro Valley Golf Land.

2368
02:52:52,606 --> 02:52:53,026
[SPEAKER_13]: Very nice.

2369
02:52:54,027 --> 02:52:55,268
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's see if we get a match, Loki.

2370
02:52:57,470 --> 02:53:03,335
[SPEAKER_13]: She took a trip to the Big Thunder Mountain.

2371
02:53:03,495 --> 02:53:05,236
[SPEAKER_13]: To ride the Big Thunder Mountain Railroad.

2372
02:53:07,338 --> 02:53:09,299
[SPEAKER_13]: I thought you were about to say the Dark Black Forest, but...

2373
02:53:13,155 --> 02:53:34,029
[SPEAKER_13]: I said she was going to take a trip to the McFlicky Dick Nicky and you know I tried to toss you a bone and you didn't take it so you lose, sorry Joey I couldn't think of anything but she took a trip to the old Penisville Penisville, how nice Jamie

2374
02:53:35,043 --> 02:53:39,626
[SPEAKER_07]: She took a trip to that handbasket going straight to hell to join the Orange Challenge crew on their way there.

2375
02:53:40,006 --> 02:53:41,667
[SPEAKER_07]: Yay!

2376
02:53:41,787 --> 02:53:43,288
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to hell!

2377
02:53:47,311 --> 02:53:48,251
[SPEAKER_13]: Poppy, your answer.

2378
02:53:49,132 --> 02:53:51,493
[SPEAKER_10]: I said, to ride the Death Traps at Disneyland.

2379
02:53:51,773 --> 02:53:52,774
[SPEAKER_13]: The Death Traps at Disneyland.

2380
02:53:52,794 --> 02:53:54,555
[SPEAKER_13]: See, Disneyland would have got you two points right there.

2381
02:53:55,516 --> 02:53:55,896
[SPEAKER_13]: Bradley.

2382
02:53:56,877 --> 02:53:59,078
[SPEAKER_13]: She took a trip to her local whorehouse.

2383
02:53:59,318 --> 02:54:00,799
[SPEAKER_13]: To her local whorehouse!

2384
02:54:00,979 --> 02:54:02,160
[SPEAKER_13]: Practical, but not a match.

2385
02:54:05,000 --> 02:54:07,081
[SPEAKER_13]: She took a trip to Dig Up Grandpa.

2386
02:54:07,361 --> 02:54:09,821
[SPEAKER_13]: She took a trip to Dig Up Grandpa.

2387
02:54:10,742 --> 02:54:12,602
[SPEAKER_13]: Beautiful, but not a match.

2388
02:54:14,683 --> 02:54:15,083
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

2389
02:54:15,223 --> 02:54:17,563
[SPEAKER_13]: Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah.

2390
02:54:17,583 --> 02:54:20,724
[SPEAKER_13]: So, the final score is DJ Tyrant.

2391
02:54:21,164 --> 02:54:21,684
[SPEAKER_13]: One point.

2392
02:54:22,845 --> 02:54:23,545
[SPEAKER_13]: No styling.

2393
02:54:23,705 --> 02:54:24,265
[SPEAKER_13]: One point.

2394
02:54:25,545 --> 02:54:27,346
[SPEAKER_13]: So, who do we want to win?

2395
02:54:27,406 --> 02:54:28,306
[SPEAKER_13]: Who do we want to win?

2396
02:54:30,475 --> 02:54:31,556
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, that's right, you know what?

2397
02:54:31,596 --> 02:54:33,979
[SPEAKER_13]: When they tie, that means we win.

2398
02:54:34,019 --> 02:54:35,861
[SPEAKER_13]: So congratulations, Orange Lodge Radio.

2399
02:54:37,362 --> 02:54:39,024
[SPEAKER_13]: Beat the chat room, because we're better.

2400
02:54:39,525 --> 02:54:41,267
[SPEAKER_13]: Just kidding, just kidding, stay, stay.

2401
02:54:43,308 --> 02:54:48,811
[SPEAKER_14]: I forgot to mention for my birthday, well this is probably something for the afterbirth, but I got erotic magnets.

2402
02:54:49,611 --> 02:54:51,072
[SPEAKER_14]: Erotic poetry magnets.

2403
02:54:51,872 --> 02:54:55,034
[SPEAKER_14]: You can make... Because they're not on the fridge.

2404
02:54:55,054 --> 02:54:58,456
[SPEAKER_14]: Because people need to be creative and put erotic phrases on the fridge.

2405
02:54:58,516 --> 02:55:04,479
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll go do one right now.

2406
02:55:05,460 --> 02:55:09,922
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, I have no time to take a break, so I need to wrap up what's the news I wanted to get to.

2407
02:55:10,854 --> 02:55:14,236
[SPEAKER_13]: Bomani News, here we go, last three minutes of the show, we have some Bomani News.

2408
02:55:16,898 --> 02:55:20,160
[SPEAKER_13]: More US home version songs have been confirmed for Max 2.

2409
02:55:20,240 --> 02:55:20,820
[SPEAKER_13]: Here they are.

2410
02:55:20,920 --> 02:55:22,441
[SPEAKER_13]: Loki will be surprised at some of these.

2411
02:55:23,201 --> 02:55:24,182
[SPEAKER_13]: Feeling of Love.

2412
02:55:24,802 --> 02:55:25,783
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh my god!

2413
02:55:27,644 --> 02:55:28,585
[SPEAKER_13]: Max Unlimited.

2414
02:55:29,285 --> 02:55:29,805
[SPEAKER_13]: Surprise.

2415
02:55:29,846 --> 02:55:31,867
[SPEAKER_13]: More Deep, version 2.1.

2416
02:55:32,487 --> 02:55:33,208
[SPEAKER_13]: A good song.

2417
02:55:33,348 --> 02:55:34,308
[SPEAKER_13]: And Xenon.

2418
02:55:36,510 --> 02:55:37,470
[SPEAKER_13]: Max 2, that'll be interesting.

2419
02:55:39,031 --> 02:55:40,132
[SPEAKER_13]: DDR Ultra Mix.

2420
02:55:41,417 --> 02:55:43,677
[SPEAKER_13]: Castles in the Sky will be in DDR Ultramix.

2421
02:55:43,697 --> 02:55:44,618
[SPEAKER_13]: That's Ian Vandal.

2422
02:55:46,358 --> 02:55:48,618
[SPEAKER_13]: Colors by DJ Taka and Sugaru.

2423
02:55:50,299 --> 02:55:58,020
[SPEAKER_13]: Also in other news on DDR Freak right now, they're having people suggest songs that you would like to see in Ultramix.

2424
02:55:58,040 --> 02:56:01,681
[SPEAKER_14]: It's probably one of those packs you have to buy for songs and whatnot.

2425
02:56:02,221 --> 02:56:04,222
[SPEAKER_14]: So go there and do that.

2426
02:56:05,782 --> 02:56:11,206
[SPEAKER_14]: DDR Max 2 is going to have an all new updated system for the diet mode.

2427
02:56:11,246 --> 02:56:19,293
[SPEAKER_14]: They're going to have workout courses you can do, like low impact, high impact, I'm lazy, that type of thing.

2428
02:56:21,034 --> 02:56:21,955
[SPEAKER_14]: Some fun stuff like that.

2429
02:56:22,175 --> 02:56:24,917
[SPEAKER_14]: And you're probably going to see Max Period at some point in there.

2430
02:56:26,719 --> 02:56:29,741
[SPEAKER_14]: That's the dumbest name for a freaking song I've ever seen.

2431
02:56:30,489 --> 02:56:31,271
[SPEAKER_13]: You know what's interesting?

2432
02:56:31,331 --> 02:56:35,883
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm noticing more and more that Max 2 is basically a US version of Xtreme.

2433
02:56:36,023 --> 02:56:36,585
[SPEAKER_13]: It really is.

2434
02:56:37,006 --> 02:56:38,630
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a US version of the Japanese Xtreme.

2435
02:56:38,730 --> 02:56:39,573
[SPEAKER_13]: So that means it's going to suck.

2436
02:56:40,302 --> 02:56:43,684
[SPEAKER_13]: No, I think it's actually going to be really good because we've already all played Xtreme.

2437
02:56:44,244 --> 02:56:46,686
[SPEAKER_13]: You know what's interesting though?

2438
02:56:46,806 --> 02:56:47,926
[SPEAKER_13]: We played the demo.

2439
02:56:48,527 --> 02:56:50,428
[SPEAKER_13]: Loki and I played the demo for Max 2 USA.

2440
02:56:50,468 --> 02:56:50,828
[SPEAKER_13]: We have it.

2441
02:56:51,108 --> 02:56:52,289
[SPEAKER_13]: And we were playing D2R.

2442
02:56:52,349 --> 02:56:55,430
[SPEAKER_13]: The first thing I noticed is that D2R has Xtreme's video.

2443
02:56:55,831 --> 02:56:57,532
[SPEAKER_13]: It doesn't have the D2R video for Max 2.

2444
02:56:57,932 --> 02:56:59,112
[SPEAKER_13]: Because they're different.

2445
02:56:59,333 --> 02:56:59,813
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, they are.

2446
02:57:00,353 --> 02:57:04,055
[SPEAKER_13]: In Xtreme, I recognize one of the videos.

2447
02:57:04,095 --> 02:57:07,797
[SPEAKER_13]: It's like a matrix effect where you have the numbers changing while it's running down the screen.

2448
02:57:08,077 --> 02:57:08,738
[SPEAKER_13]: That was in Max 2.

2449
02:57:09,578 --> 02:57:10,018
[SPEAKER_13]: No, it wasn't.

2450
02:57:10,219 --> 02:57:11,459
[SPEAKER_13]: But it wasn't in the D2R video.

2451
02:57:12,620 --> 02:57:13,601
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm almost positive.

2452
02:57:13,621 --> 02:57:16,843
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm like 99% positive that D2R has a new video in this.

2453
02:57:17,123 --> 02:57:19,885
[SPEAKER_13]: It has the Extremes video, not Max 2's video.

2454
02:57:19,925 --> 02:57:20,645
[SPEAKER_10]: It doesn't really matter.

2455
02:57:20,685 --> 02:57:21,446
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a background video.

2456
02:57:21,826 --> 02:57:22,286
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, I know.

2457
02:57:22,467 --> 02:57:28,110
[SPEAKER_13]: Not that we really give a shit, but that makes me think that, oh, it's based off Extremes Engine, not Max 2.

2458
02:57:29,291 --> 02:57:30,892
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, didn't... Whatever.

2459
02:57:31,092 --> 02:57:33,634
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, I thought they said that... It's based off of Euromix 2.

2460
02:57:33,674 --> 02:57:33,974
[SPEAKER_13]: Ew!

2461
02:57:33,994 --> 02:57:35,335
[SPEAKER_13]: It's not an engine.

2462
02:57:37,630 --> 02:57:39,992
[SPEAKER_13]: I had a point I wanted to make.

2463
02:57:41,412 --> 02:57:55,459
[SPEAKER_13]: Also in Extreme, they've announced that most of the unlocks from the arcade, I'm not going to read the whole list, but pretty much anything that was unlocked by a code in the arcade, songs such as Sync, Dance Dance Revolution, Paranoia Survivor, etc.

2464
02:57:55,619 --> 02:57:56,259
[SPEAKER_13]: is a hidden track.

2465
02:58:00,120 --> 02:58:04,441
[SPEAKER_13]: Pixie Dust is suggesting your mama's on crack rock should be in DDR Max 2.

2466
02:58:05,422 --> 02:58:07,022
[SPEAKER_13]: You should go suggest that in the DDR pre-credits.

2467
02:58:07,042 --> 02:58:10,503
[SPEAKER_07]: That is the best suggestion ever to be in DDR.

2468
02:58:10,963 --> 02:58:13,064
[SPEAKER_07]: Not my mama, my mama in rehab.

2469
02:58:14,324 --> 02:58:15,404
[SPEAKER_07]: That song was the best.

2470
02:58:15,504 --> 02:58:18,345
[SPEAKER_07]: I have like on a tape that I made when I was in middle school.

2471
02:58:20,985 --> 02:58:21,786
[SPEAKER_12]: What a lovely thought.

2472
02:58:21,826 --> 02:58:22,886
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to go download that tonight.

2473
02:58:25,586 --> 02:58:28,167
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, any other Bomani news anyone had to report?

2474
02:58:28,227 --> 02:58:29,527
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, we've got the game.

2475
02:58:29,587 --> 02:58:31,448
[SPEAKER_13]: The game is out in a week and a half, Max 2.

2476
02:58:31,848 --> 02:58:38,110
[SPEAKER_13]: And Wednesday night, a week from Wednesday, we're going to do what we did for Max 1.

2477
02:58:38,150 --> 02:58:38,930
[SPEAKER_13]: We're going to play it.

2478
02:58:39,050 --> 02:58:41,611
[SPEAKER_13]: We're going to just bring home the copy and play it on air.

2479
02:58:43,292 --> 02:58:47,573
[SPEAKER_13]: Although I believe it's actually being released on Tuesday, right?

2480
02:58:48,297 --> 02:58:50,818
[SPEAKER_13]: This Wednesday we're going to have some surprise programming.

2481
02:58:51,359 --> 02:58:51,599
[SPEAKER_13]: Who knows?

2482
02:59:17,751 --> 02:59:19,313
[SPEAKER_13]: Now is the part of the show, I believe.

2483
02:59:19,373 --> 02:59:23,296
[SPEAKER_13]: It's time to go around and gather everyone's final thoughts, I think.

2484
02:59:25,617 --> 02:59:26,898
[SPEAKER_13]: Unless anyone else has Bomani's?

2485
02:59:26,938 --> 02:59:28,600
[SPEAKER_07]: No, they need to have the Ohaska.

2486
02:59:32,903 --> 02:59:33,523
[SPEAKER_13]: That would be cool.

2487
02:59:35,885 --> 02:59:36,165
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

2488
02:59:38,447 --> 02:59:39,248
[SPEAKER_13]: Final thoughts time.

2489
02:59:39,628 --> 02:59:40,228
[SPEAKER_13]: I guess we're there.

2490
02:59:40,509 --> 02:59:41,990
[SPEAKER_13]: Unless anybody else has anything they want to bring up?

2491
02:59:45,575 --> 02:59:47,036
[SPEAKER_13]: Good, we can end this train wreck of a show.

2492
02:59:47,816 --> 02:59:48,057
[SPEAKER_13]: What?

2493
02:59:49,157 --> 02:59:50,078
[SPEAKER_13]: Play endearing music.

2494
02:59:50,098 --> 02:59:51,159
[SPEAKER_13]: Play endearing music.

2495
02:59:51,179 --> 02:59:51,419
[SPEAKER_01]: Like what?

2496
02:59:51,939 --> 02:59:57,223
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't, why do you, why do you Give me a final thought, dammit.

2497
02:59:57,283 --> 02:59:58,243
[SPEAKER_13]: Give me a final thought.

2498
02:59:58,263 --> 02:59:58,884
[SPEAKER_13]: Uh, College Rules.

2499
03:00:00,665 --> 03:00:01,025
[SPEAKER_13]: Lovely.

2500
03:00:01,645 --> 03:00:02,806
[SPEAKER_13]: Bradley, do you have a final thought?

2501
03:00:03,707 --> 03:00:05,508
[SPEAKER_13]: Uh, slam it, cram it, jam it, dammit.

2502
03:00:07,529 --> 03:00:08,070
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

2503
03:00:09,330 --> 03:00:09,931
[SPEAKER_13]: Punk Night.

2504
03:00:10,931 --> 03:00:11,512
[SPEAKER_13]: Muzzletuff.

2505
03:00:12,432 --> 03:00:12,933
[SPEAKER_13]: I hate you.

2506
03:00:17,895 --> 03:00:18,215
[SPEAKER_13]: Jamie.

2507
03:00:18,455 --> 03:00:19,937
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, Joey, do you have a final thought?

2508
03:00:20,457 --> 03:00:21,358
[SPEAKER_13]: No, he has no final thought.

2509
03:00:22,639 --> 03:00:23,440
[SPEAKER_13]: What, you want to go last?

2510
03:00:24,421 --> 03:00:27,804
[SPEAKER_13]: My final thought is... Yay.

2511
03:00:29,025 --> 03:00:29,325
[SPEAKER_13]: Loki.

2512
03:00:31,787 --> 03:00:34,089
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm going to have an arcade cabinet and you don't.

2513
03:00:34,169 --> 03:00:36,211
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm going to have an arcade cabinet and you don't.

2514
03:00:38,653 --> 03:00:40,534
[SPEAKER_07]: My final thought, and I have a microphone.

2515
03:00:40,554 --> 03:00:41,415
[SPEAKER_03]: Knee-er, knee-er, knee-er.

2516
03:00:41,555 --> 03:00:43,897
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, you know, I'm going to have one when I get my house, so...

2517
03:00:46,535 --> 03:00:51,657
[SPEAKER_07]: My final thought is go to your local game shop and pre-order Transformers Season 3 box set.

2518
03:00:52,897 --> 03:00:56,119
[SPEAKER_07]: And sign up for roleplay.darksakura.com.

2519
03:00:56,359 --> 03:01:02,421
[SPEAKER_14]: And right after the show at 10pm, be sure to tune in to Conan O'Brien's 10th Anniversary Special.

2520
03:01:03,041 --> 03:01:02,421
9.30.

2521
03:01:03,301 --> 03:01:05,182
[SPEAKER_14]: 9.30.

2522
03:01:04,181 --> 03:01:05,182
[SPEAKER_13]: Right now.

2523
03:01:05,262 --> 03:01:05,602
[SPEAKER_06]: Right now.

2524
03:01:05,822 --> 03:01:06,662
[SPEAKER_13]: On your TV.

2525
03:01:08,923 --> 03:01:11,244
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, so I guess that's a sign we need to end this show then.

2526
03:01:12,637 --> 03:01:13,878
[SPEAKER_13]: The final word of the show.

2527
03:01:14,198 --> 03:01:15,159
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll give it to Joey.

2528
03:01:15,820 --> 03:01:16,681
[SPEAKER_13]: He gets one word.

2529
03:01:16,721 --> 03:01:18,662
[SPEAKER_13]: You say one word and it's the final word of the show.

2530
03:01:18,702 --> 03:01:19,883
[SPEAKER_13]: So what is the final word of the show?

2531
03:01:21,285 --> 03:01:21,705
[SPEAKER_13]: Peace.

2532
03:01:24,888 --> 03:01:27,310

2535
03:01:34,376 --> 03:01:37,159
[SPEAKER_13]: And now, here's your fortune cookie message of the day.

2536
03:01:38,376 --> 03:01:40,139
