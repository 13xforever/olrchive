1
00:00:00,049 --> 00:00:03,131
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't even get a lousy copy of our home game.

2
00:00:03,191 --> 00:00:06,514
[SPEAKER_11]: You're a complete loser.

3
00:00:06,634 --> 00:00:10,697
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't know what I was thinking of.

4
00:00:11,357 --> 00:00:14,960
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess I just wasn't too bright.

5
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:19,143
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I sure hope I do better.

6
00:00:20,264 --> 00:00:22,786
[SPEAKER_09]: Next weekend on The Price is Right.

7
00:00:23,767 --> 00:00:25,548
[SPEAKER_09]: I lost on Jeopardy.

8
00:00:41,046 --> 00:00:42,294
[SPEAKER_09]: I lost on Jeopardy!

9
00:00:42,334 --> 00:00:42,657
[SPEAKER_09]: Bang!

10
00:01:15,963 --> 00:01:36,400
[SPEAKER_09]: Rock the cradle of love Rock the cradle of love Yes, the cradle of love Don't rock easy, it's true Rock the cradle of love I rock the cradle of love Yes, the cradle of love Don't rock easy, it's true

11
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:48,563
[SPEAKER_10]: The Love Shack is a little old place where we can get together.

12
00:01:48,583 --> 00:01:49,644
[SPEAKER_09]: Love Shack, baby.

13
00:01:49,664 --> 00:01:51,285
[SPEAKER_09]: Love Shack, baby, Love Shack.

00:01:51,345 --> 00:01:52,986
[SPEAKER_09]: Pump up the jam.

15
00:01:53,026 --> 00:01:54,748
[SPEAKER_09]: Pump up the jam.

16
00:01:54,768 --> 00:01:56,089
[SPEAKER_09]: Pump it up.

17
00:01:56,129 --> 00:01:57,530
[SPEAKER_09]: That's me in the corner.

[SPEAKER_09]: That's me in the

00:02:15,293 --> 00:02:23,801
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm losing my religion, trying to keep a view, and I don't know if I can do it.

20
00:02:25,062 --> 00:02:30,247
[SPEAKER_09]: I've said too much, I haven't said enough.

21
00:02:32,409 --> 00:02:35,252
[SPEAKER_09]: The things you say, your purpose just gives you away.

22
00:02:35,272 --> 00:02:38,114
[SPEAKER_09]: The things you say, you're unbelievable.

23
00:02:46,568 --> 00:03:04,217
[SPEAKER_09]: Do me baby You can do me in the morning You can do me in the night You can do me when you wanna do me You're the lady who Exit light Enter night Take my hand Off to Never Never Land

00:03:16,877 --> 00:03:37,933

[SPEAKER_11]: Ice Ice Baby, Ice Ice Baby Ice Ice Baby, Ice Ice Baby

27
00:05:02,782 --> 00:05:06,702
[SPEAKER_07]: Toto, I think we're not in Kansas anymore.

28
00:05:10,157 --> 00:05:12,718
[SPEAKER_05]: You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

29
00:05:13,078 --> 00:05:15,039
[SPEAKER_05]: Mamani Talk, and then some.

30
00:05:15,719 --> 00:05:18,420
[SPEAKER_15]: Uh, mostly the, and then some, part of that.

31
00:05:18,801 --> 00:05:22,802
[SPEAKER_05]: Orange Lounge Radio is created by a bunch of potty-mouthed adults.

32
00:05:23,443 --> 00:05:28,245
[SPEAKER_05]: Orange Lounge may contain sexual, perverted, and mildly retarded content.

33
00:05:28,825 --> 00:05:32,506
[SPEAKER_05]: You probably shouldn't let your children listen to Orange Lounge Radio.

34
00:05:32,626 --> 00:05:34,087
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes, I will spank your child.

35
00:05:34,487 --> 00:05:36,208
[SPEAKER_21]: If you're not going to do your job, goddammit, I will.

36
00:05:40,988 --> 00:05:43,049
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, here's to my big opening.

37
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:44,730
[SPEAKER_19]: A sphincter says what?

38
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:46,992
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm super, thanks for asking.

39
00:05:47,372 --> 00:05:49,953
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, you little bitch troll from hell.

40
00:05:49,993 --> 00:05:51,154
[SPEAKER_09]: What am I doing here?

41
00:05:51,174 --> 00:05:51,814
[SPEAKER_09]: Dodge this.

42
00:05:57,750 --> 00:06:00,252
[SPEAKER_03]: Look, you stupid bastard, you've got no arms left.

43
00:06:00,432 --> 00:06:01,073
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I have.

44
00:06:01,493 --> 00:06:03,314
[SPEAKER_11]: Look, there's a flesh wound.

45
00:06:03,534 --> 00:06:09,779
[SPEAKER_07]: Searching for a boy in high school is as useless as searching for meaning in a Pauly Shore movie.

46
00:06:10,719 --> 00:06:11,260
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, yeah?

47
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:14,882
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, I hope your babies look like monkeys.

48
00:06:15,062 --> 00:06:16,103
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura.

49
00:06:16,343 --> 00:06:17,264
[SPEAKER_04]: I've had a sniff.

50
00:06:17,464 --> 00:06:18,004
[SPEAKER_04]: Skye.

51
00:06:18,104 --> 00:06:20,226
[SPEAKER_05]: But I'm playing it for the bartender, so suffer.

52
00:06:20,586 --> 00:06:21,106
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki.

53
00:06:21,367 --> 00:06:22,407
[SPEAKER_05]: I hate you.

54
00:06:22,787 --> 00:06:24,168
[SPEAKER_05]: Orange Lounge Radio.

55
00:06:24,188 --> 00:06:24,429
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.

56
00:06:26,656 --> 00:06:32,758
[SPEAKER_15]: We are live, and this is episode number .59 for September the 7th of 2003.

57
00:06:34,919 --> 00:06:36,299
[SPEAKER_15]: I made a .59 joke.

58
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:38,140
[SPEAKER_15]: Nerd.

59
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:44,302
[SPEAKER_15]: You're tuned into the Be Money Scene's most glompy radio station of all things Be Money.

60
00:06:45,002 --> 00:06:47,323
[SPEAKER_15]: My name is Rob Roberts, but you might know me as Sky.

61
00:06:48,343 --> 00:06:50,804
[SPEAKER_15]: Joining me, as always, are my awesome co-hosts.

62
00:06:50,924 --> 00:06:53,965
[SPEAKER_15]: In this corner, the happiest bunny on the farm is Jamie Summers.

63
00:06:54,485 --> 00:06:55,166
[SPEAKER_19]: I want to nap.

64
00:06:56,474 --> 00:06:58,135
[SPEAKER_15]: You know her better as DarkSakura.

65
00:06:59,796 --> 00:07:01,797
[SPEAKER_15]: Or today, it's NappySakura.

66
00:07:02,237 --> 00:07:03,218
[SPEAKER_15]: She needs to take a nap.

67
00:07:03,698 --> 00:07:05,819
[SPEAKER_20]: What?

68
00:07:08,841 --> 00:07:10,022
[SPEAKER_15]: It's BabySakura.

69
00:07:10,562 --> 00:07:15,785
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm going to kick your ass in a moment.

70
00:07:15,825 --> 00:07:17,426
[SPEAKER_21]: I'll be contagious if you watch.

71
00:07:17,506 --> 00:07:18,987
[SPEAKER_15]: It's AngryBabySakura.

72
00:07:20,528 --> 00:07:23,029
[SPEAKER_15]: In that corner, say hello to our TechMassa, Loki.

73
00:07:23,049 --> 00:07:24,330
[SPEAKER_15]: Hello.

74
00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:24,510
[SPEAKER_15]: Hello.

75
00:07:27,285 --> 00:07:29,467
[SPEAKER_15]: Also with us tonight we have... Air.

76
00:07:29,887 --> 00:07:30,408
[SPEAKER_15]: Nobody!

77
00:07:30,908 --> 00:07:31,589
[SPEAKER_21]: No, we have air.

78
00:07:32,230 --> 00:07:32,770
[SPEAKER_15]: We have air.

79
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:33,911
[SPEAKER_21]: We have particles.

80
00:07:34,131 --> 00:07:40,136
[SPEAKER_15]: See, if I'd had that song chewed up, I could have played air and made another funny Bomani joke, like two jokes in 60 seconds.

81
00:07:40,717 --> 00:07:44,600
[SPEAKER_21]: We have germs and other single-celled organisms.

82
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:45,601
[SPEAKER_21]: We are not alone here.

83
00:07:45,621 --> 00:07:47,343
[SPEAKER_15]: And a fart of mine in the back of the room.

84
00:07:48,564 --> 00:07:54,029
[SPEAKER_15]: And by making those two Bomani jokes in a row, you would have qualified for the quota for us to kill you.

85
00:07:57,003 --> 00:07:57,704
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm so excited.

86
00:07:57,744 --> 00:08:00,346
[SPEAKER_21]: I have a blunt object somewhere around here I could beat you with.

87
00:08:01,227 --> 00:08:02,127
[SPEAKER_16]: You have the microphone.

88
00:08:02,388 --> 00:08:02,968
[SPEAKER_21]: Where's the ferret?

89
00:08:03,328 --> 00:08:03,809
[SPEAKER_16]: You know what?

90
00:08:03,909 --> 00:08:07,452
[SPEAKER_15]: One of them's... I think... I think they're missing.

91
00:08:08,072 --> 00:08:09,854
[SPEAKER_15]: I honestly... And I didn't kill them, I swear.

92
00:08:09,914 --> 00:08:10,935
[SPEAKER_15]: I think they're missing.

93
00:08:10,955 --> 00:08:11,796
[SPEAKER_15]: They're around here somewhere.

94
00:08:11,836 --> 00:08:12,336
[SPEAKER_15]: They gotta be.

95
00:08:14,478 --> 00:08:16,359
[SPEAKER_15]: We'll have to go on a ferret hunt later.

96
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:20,263
[SPEAKER_15]: You're gonna hunt to save it, and I'm gonna hunt to kill it.

97
00:08:20,323 --> 00:08:22,825
[SPEAKER_21]: I'll just make you smell my shoe.

98
00:08:22,845 --> 00:08:22,885
[SPEAKER_21]: Um...

99
00:08:25,914 --> 00:08:26,855
[SPEAKER_15]: We'll be back.

100
00:08:26,915 --> 00:08:29,779
[SPEAKER_15]: We're a little dead tonight, so it's going to be an interesting show.

101
00:08:31,741 --> 00:08:34,164
[SPEAKER_15]: DarkSakura's kind of feeling a little under the weather, I think.

102
00:08:34,504 --> 00:08:36,426
[SPEAKER_19]: Hooray for upper respiratory infections.

103
00:08:36,526 --> 00:08:37,688
[SPEAKER_19]: Hooray for ear infections.

104
00:08:41,372 --> 00:08:42,333
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, that perked her right up.

105
00:08:43,835 --> 00:08:46,498
[SPEAKER_15]: Does that mean the cure for the common cold is a nice, friendly ferret?

106
00:08:47,322 --> 00:08:48,863
[SPEAKER_19]: I am happy and full of spirit.

107
00:08:48,943 --> 00:08:49,804
[SPEAKER_15]: Loki, you are evil.

108
00:08:51,545 --> 00:08:54,548
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm feeling kind of, I'm feeling tired too.

109
00:08:54,628 --> 00:08:57,430
[SPEAKER_15]: I've done nothing but really nap, like all week long.

110
00:09:03,434 --> 00:09:04,375
[SPEAKER_15]: I love that sound.

111
00:09:04,495 --> 00:09:05,576
[SPEAKER_21]: That makes me go squee.

112
00:09:06,178 --> 00:09:06,818
[SPEAKER_15]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

113
00:09:39,291 --> 00:09:39,974
Thanks for watching!

114
00:11:14,344 --> 00:11:15,485
Thanks for watching!

115
00:12:33,677 --> 00:12:34,238
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks for watching!

116
00:13:07,117 --> 00:13:07,798
DarkSakura

117
00:14:14,918 --> 00:14:18,081
DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

118
00:14:55,242 --> 00:15:01,826
[SPEAKER_12]: Nico Meow, Nico Meow, Nico Meow, Nico Meow, Meow, Meow Oh, ass!

119
00:15:02,347 --> 00:15:23,381
[SPEAKER_15]: This randomness could only be brought to you by Orange Lounge Hello everybody and welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio In that sense you heard .59 appropriate because this is the 59th show of Orange Lounge Radio And Yamato with 2002 Does that mean we're heavenly?

120
00:15:25,169 --> 00:15:26,610
[SPEAKER_15]: This show is heavenly.

121
00:15:27,011 --> 00:15:27,471
[SPEAKER_21]: Ha ha.

122
00:15:27,611 --> 00:15:28,612
[SPEAKER_15]: Except we're all going to hell.

123
00:15:28,832 --> 00:15:29,433
[SPEAKER_17]: I made a joke.

124
00:15:29,833 --> 00:15:30,254
[SPEAKER_17]: Ha ha.

125
00:15:30,674 --> 00:15:31,074
[SPEAKER_15]: Yay.

126
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:33,056
[SPEAKER_15]: Tengoku joke.

127
00:15:33,697 --> 00:15:34,117
Ha ha.

128
00:15:34,818 --> 00:15:42,985
[SPEAKER_15]: And I was going to make it an all numbers set, but Jamie really wanted to hear Ninzaburro and that didn't sound like such a bad idea, so you had a couple numbered songs and then Ninzaburro.

129
00:15:46,428 --> 00:15:47,209
[SPEAKER_15]: Ninzaburro's cool.

130
00:15:48,146 --> 00:15:50,787
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, I'm still trying to find episodes of the show.

131
00:15:51,027 --> 00:15:52,607
[SPEAKER_15]: It sounded a little fast to you, huh?

132
00:15:52,927 --> 00:15:53,227
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

133
00:16:09,891 --> 00:16:15,134
[SPEAKER_15]: And especially in 4th Mix, like, remember how fast Dropout seemed in 4th Mix?

134
00:16:15,154 --> 00:16:17,655
[SPEAKER_15]: Because Dropout was like the max 300 of its time, right?

135
00:16:17,955 --> 00:16:20,156
[SPEAKER_15]: It was just like, oh my god, the arrows are coming up so fast.

136
00:16:20,885 --> 00:16:26,988
[SPEAKER_15]: When you go and you play Dropout on Max 2 or something, you're like, oh, this is easy.

137
00:16:27,528 --> 00:16:28,649
[SPEAKER_15]: Dropout's easy.

138
00:16:28,709 --> 00:16:32,630
[SPEAKER_15]: And it's weird how much that frame rate totally changed things.

139
00:16:33,010 --> 00:16:41,134
[SPEAKER_15]: So I think that's why Ninzaburro maybe... Well, then again, of course, that goes reverse my philosophy because then Ninzaburro would have played faster.

140
00:16:41,214 --> 00:16:41,634
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know.

141
00:16:42,655 --> 00:16:47,577
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, I guess it depends if you played it on 4th or 5th mix because 5th mix is when the frame rate started to change.

142
00:16:49,438 --> 00:16:49,738
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know.

143
00:16:50,563 --> 00:16:51,865
[SPEAKER_15]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

144
00:17:06,339 --> 00:17:08,041
[SPEAKER_21]: The beginning of the week was okay.

145
00:17:08,501 --> 00:17:12,665
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, I think it was really good because that's when Marin Chan and Rick were here.

146
00:17:13,305 --> 00:17:13,786
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, yes.

147
00:17:14,346 --> 00:17:16,888
[SPEAKER_21]: And had a very good time.

148
00:17:17,349 --> 00:17:26,217
[SPEAKER_21]: The air conditioner went out, though, on Sunday night, or during the day on Sunday, and it was out Monday, and it was out Tuesday, and it was out Wednesday.

149
00:17:27,317 --> 00:17:30,060
[SPEAKER_21]: And it was really hot on Wednesday.

150
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:32,322
[SPEAKER_21]: I went to work, and I was feeling just wretched.

151
00:17:32,962 --> 00:17:34,183
[SPEAKER_21]: But I made it through my day of work.

152
00:17:34,903 --> 00:17:35,824
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, sorry, Tuesday.

153
00:17:36,284 --> 00:17:37,905
[SPEAKER_21]: I went back to work and I was feeling really crappy.

154
00:17:38,745 --> 00:17:41,887
[SPEAKER_21]: And I went to work Wednesday and was feeling even worse.

155
00:17:43,147 --> 00:17:47,690
[SPEAKER_21]: And then when I went into work Thursday, I don't remember the entire drive to work.

156
00:17:47,790 --> 00:17:48,870
[SPEAKER_21]: And that's not a good sign.

157
00:17:49,831 --> 00:17:51,732
[SPEAKER_15]: You didn't fall asleep during the drive, did you?

158
00:17:51,892 --> 00:17:52,272
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't know.

159
00:17:52,852 --> 00:17:53,493
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't remember.

160
00:17:54,828 --> 00:17:59,250
[SPEAKER_21]: and, um, I was having bad dizzy spells and finally I just, you know, asked, I asked if I could go home.

161
00:17:59,290 --> 00:18:00,210
[SPEAKER_21]: I was not feeling good at all.

162
00:18:00,490 --> 00:18:09,534
[SPEAKER_21]: I was running a fever and, um, I was feel, I, I remember driving home but I had dizzy spells on the way home which, you know, good thing there was light traffic.

163
00:18:10,594 --> 00:18:20,658
[SPEAKER_21]: Um, so I, I got home and scheduled my, and, and everyone knows me, I don't go to the doctor unless I have to and I scheduled myself an appointment for the doctor that night and, uh,

164
00:18:21,158 --> 00:18:25,641
[SPEAKER_21]: Turns out that I have a respiratory infection and an ear infection in my right ear.

165
00:18:26,321 --> 00:18:28,483
[SPEAKER_21]: I am no longer contagious, which is good for you guys.

166
00:18:29,063 --> 00:18:30,184
[SPEAKER_15]: That's a very good sign, thank you.

167
00:18:30,204 --> 00:18:32,846
[SPEAKER_21]: Because I've been on antibiotics now all weekend.

168
00:18:33,546 --> 00:18:36,408
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm going to be on antibiotics for the rest of the week and after that.

169
00:18:36,428 --> 00:18:40,711
[SPEAKER_21]: How about getting off of these antibiotics?

170
00:18:42,352 --> 00:18:48,036
[SPEAKER_21]: I am on this stuff that I have to put up my nose and squirt and it burns.

171
00:18:48,936 --> 00:18:49,817
[SPEAKER_21]: It smells like burning.

172
00:18:51,287 --> 00:18:59,893
[SPEAKER_21]: And, um... And I'm on my inhaler again for Abuderal, which I was supposed to get six refills of it, and I only got, like, zero.

173
00:19:00,494 --> 00:19:06,878
[SPEAKER_21]: So I'm going to have to make sure that it wasn't my doctor's, you know, doctor handwriting, which is basic doctor handwriting.

174
00:19:07,779 --> 00:19:16,525
[SPEAKER_21]: Um... I, uh... I was feeling a lot better, though, on Friday after sleeping for about 15 hours.

175
00:19:16,605 --> 00:19:16,765
[SPEAKER_21]: And, uh...

176
00:19:20,430 --> 00:19:21,591
[SPEAKER_21]: and did my thing that day.

177
00:19:23,552 --> 00:19:38,242
[SPEAKER_21]: Yesterday, though, I got up at the butt cracker dawn, which is about 10 in the morning for me, and made it over to Iguana Girl's house and a bunch of us all went to see Weird Al in Madeira.

178
00:19:38,642 --> 00:19:39,463
[SPEAKER_15]: How's Moo doing?

179
00:19:40,083 --> 00:19:41,264
[SPEAKER_21]: Moo is so cute.

180
00:19:41,805 --> 00:19:43,025
[SPEAKER_21]: Moo's got a big belly.

181
00:19:44,126 --> 00:19:46,768
[SPEAKER_21]: Moo is Iguana Girl's iguana.

182
00:19:48,101 --> 00:19:52,683
[SPEAKER_15]: We also have a regular chatter named Moo, and we have a Mooheimer.

183
00:19:54,044 --> 00:19:55,205
[SPEAKER_21]: This is Moo the Cute.

184
00:19:55,225 --> 00:19:56,265
[SPEAKER_15]: There's lots of Moos.

185
00:19:56,365 --> 00:19:57,366
[SPEAKER_21]: Moo the Cute Iguana.

186
00:19:58,887 --> 00:20:01,088
[SPEAKER_21]: And Moo was being antsy all day.

187
00:20:01,128 --> 00:20:04,870
[SPEAKER_21]: Moo was being a little butt, but that's okay because Moo is cute.

188
00:20:06,691 --> 00:20:13,054
[SPEAKER_21]: And Melody came with us, which was really awesome.

189
00:20:14,423 --> 00:20:14,984
[SPEAKER_21]: DarkSakura.com

190
00:20:29,568 --> 00:20:31,169
[SPEAKER_21]: Because there was like happy everywhere.

191
00:20:31,189 --> 00:20:32,050
[SPEAKER_21]: It looks like happy.

192
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:33,691
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, certainly this week anyway.

193
00:20:33,711 --> 00:20:35,152
[SPEAKER_15]: Did you hear about what happened at Disneyland?

194
00:20:36,413 --> 00:20:37,253
[SPEAKER_21]: That's pretty damn funny.

195
00:20:38,114 --> 00:20:40,596
[SPEAKER_21]: And we were talking about it too on the trip.

196
00:20:40,696 --> 00:20:44,819
[SPEAKER_21]: We were talking about it on the trip and we think it's just because the guy was doing something stupid.

197
00:20:45,139 --> 00:20:50,202
[SPEAKER_21]: Because he was up in the front and we think he was trying to get into the train.

198
00:20:52,044 --> 00:20:54,565
[SPEAKER_15]: Like he was trying to jump from the train into another one or something?

199
00:20:54,726 --> 00:20:57,688
[SPEAKER_21]: No, trying to get into the front part.

200
00:20:58,028 --> 00:20:58,128
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh.

201
00:21:00,990 --> 00:21:06,694
[SPEAKER_15]: I still think it's that guy's fault.

202
00:21:08,175 --> 00:21:11,297
[SPEAKER_21]: Let's just blame it on that guy.

203
00:21:12,918 --> 00:21:15,740
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a little kid who threw gum on a track or something like that.

204
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:17,761
[SPEAKER_15]: Even better, let's blame it on a little kid.

205
00:21:17,821 --> 00:21:18,742
[SPEAKER_21]: Stupid children.

206
00:21:19,442 --> 00:21:21,784
[SPEAKER_21]: That child is a murderer and should be hung.

207
00:21:22,004 --> 00:21:22,424
Anyway, um...

208
00:21:27,108 --> 00:21:29,409
[SPEAKER_21]: Back to... Whoa, you know, that's kind of neat in the chatroom.

209
00:21:29,429 --> 00:21:30,429
[SPEAKER_21]: It looks like a little curvy.

210
00:21:30,449 --> 00:21:33,210
[SPEAKER_21]: It looks like a big nose, like Mario's nose or something.

211
00:21:33,570 --> 00:21:33,810
[SPEAKER_21]: What?

212
00:21:34,450 --> 00:21:36,631
[SPEAKER_21]: I was looking at the curve that the text took in the chatroom.

213
00:21:36,651 --> 00:21:37,471
[SPEAKER_21]: It was kind of neat looking.

214
00:21:37,991 --> 00:21:39,572
[SPEAKER_21]: Anyway, um... Okay.

215
00:21:40,172 --> 00:21:41,372
[SPEAKER_15]: Jamie's going crazy.

216
00:21:41,792 --> 00:21:42,493
[SPEAKER_21]: Fuck you.

217
00:21:42,873 --> 00:21:44,673
[SPEAKER_15]: Jamie's taking a little too many meds.

218
00:21:47,254 --> 00:21:47,974
[SPEAKER_15]: Bomber ferret.

219
00:21:48,555 --> 00:21:49,035
[SPEAKER_15]: You see this?

220
00:21:49,095 --> 00:21:49,675
[SPEAKER_15]: It's mine now.

221
00:21:49,715 --> 00:21:50,835
[SPEAKER_15]: Give me a ferret!

222
00:21:50,915 --> 00:21:51,355
[SPEAKER_15]: It's mine.

223
00:21:51,395 --> 00:21:52,436
[SPEAKER_15]: Give me a ferret!

224
00:21:52,456 --> 00:21:53,196
[SPEAKER_15]: You have a ferret.

225
00:21:54,381 --> 00:21:58,742
[SPEAKER_21]: I have my own favorite.

226
00:21:58,762 --> 00:22:02,683
[SPEAKER_21]: Tell your story.

227
00:22:02,703 --> 00:22:09,004
[SPEAKER_21]: We all sat in our seats and everything and had to go find Julie and Krista and Becky and all them who weren't going to meet us there.

228
00:22:09,304 --> 00:22:10,125
[SPEAKER_15]: People you don't know.

229
00:22:10,285 --> 00:22:12,285
[SPEAKER_15]: Listeners of Orange Ones Radio.

230
00:22:12,545 --> 00:22:13,965
[SPEAKER_21]: Julie's been in the chat room before.

231
00:22:14,185 --> 00:22:14,926
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, that's true.

232
00:22:14,946 --> 00:22:15,246
[SPEAKER_12]: That's right.

233
00:22:15,266 --> 00:22:15,586
[SPEAKER_12]: That's right.

234
00:22:15,606 --> 00:22:15,866
[SPEAKER_12]: She has.

235
00:22:16,386 --> 00:22:16,646
[SPEAKER_12]: My bad.

236
00:22:18,357 --> 00:22:24,918
[SPEAKER_21]: Anyway, Weird Al was awesome and fabulous and there were these stupid fuckers around us smoking, them getting to that later.

237
00:22:26,118 --> 00:22:26,798
[SPEAKER_21]: I had they die.

238
00:22:26,838 --> 00:22:27,979
[SPEAKER_12]: Smoking crack or what?

239
00:22:28,019 --> 00:22:30,339
[SPEAKER_21]: And then there were these sluts in the row in front of us, I swear.

240
00:22:30,759 --> 00:22:32,199
[SPEAKER_21]: They were like trying to out-hoochie each other.

241
00:22:32,219 --> 00:22:33,640
[SPEAKER_15]: Wait, sluts don't listen to Weird Al.

242
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:36,640
[SPEAKER_21]: No, no, they were in the front row and they were being sluts.

243
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:39,041
[SPEAKER_21]: They were all trying to out-slut each other.

244
00:22:40,161 --> 00:22:46,062
[SPEAKER_21]: Trying to be like super skank and everything and he was making fun of them the whole show.

245
00:22:46,202 --> 00:22:46,682
[SPEAKER_21]: It was great.

246
00:22:48,883 --> 00:22:59,756
[SPEAKER_21]: And, uh, and he was, but because he went to see one of the sluts that was in front of us to make fun of her, you know, during, uh, uh, the, uh, what is the song called?

247
00:22:59,796 --> 00:23:03,961
[SPEAKER_21]: The, uh, the one where he's going through all of the, the pickup lines?

248
00:23:04,947 --> 00:23:05,348
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know.

249
00:23:06,209 --> 00:23:07,030
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't listen to enough Weird Al.

250
00:23:07,090 --> 00:23:09,252
[SPEAKER_15]: I like Weird Al, but I don't follow him enough.

251
00:23:09,272 --> 00:23:12,256
[SPEAKER_21]: He was right in front of us, so I got a good look at him and everything.

252
00:23:12,276 --> 00:23:15,199
[SPEAKER_21]: I took a picture of the back of his head during one more minute.

253
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:17,181
[SPEAKER_21]: So wait, you guys were in the second row?

254
00:23:17,602 --> 00:23:20,966
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, there was the priority seating in front of us that was about six.

255
00:23:21,906 --> 00:23:23,247
[SPEAKER_21]: Rose are all blocked off.

256
00:23:23,828 --> 00:23:27,271
[SPEAKER_21]: But he came into our area, too, to make fun of the sluts, I guess.

257
00:23:27,992 --> 00:23:30,194
[SPEAKER_21]: He went way back in the whole paid seating area.

258
00:23:30,234 --> 00:23:30,774
[SPEAKER_21]: It was great.

259
00:23:30,854 --> 00:23:31,315
[SPEAKER_21]: That's cool.

260
00:23:31,335 --> 00:23:34,097
[SPEAKER_21]: So pay for your tickets when you go to the fair.

261
00:23:34,137 --> 00:23:35,018
[SPEAKER_21]: You'll get good seats.

262
00:23:35,298 --> 00:23:38,861
[SPEAKER_15]: Loki, they went to Fresno at the Madera County Fair.

263
00:23:39,842 --> 00:23:41,063
[SPEAKER_15]: But today was Great America.

264
00:23:41,123 --> 00:23:42,024
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm surprised you didn't go.

265
00:23:42,444 --> 00:23:42,945
[SPEAKER_21]: Because it's $40.

266
00:23:43,025 --> 00:23:43,646
[SPEAKER_21]: Not you, Loki. $50.

267
00:23:46,567 --> 00:23:50,189
[SPEAKER_15]: I was going to go, but that was supposed to be for my birthday.

268
00:23:50,389 --> 00:23:54,670
[SPEAKER_15]: But yeah, no one took me.

269
00:23:56,771 --> 00:23:58,512
[SPEAKER_12]: I didn't know you wanted to go.

270
00:23:58,552 --> 00:24:01,053
[SPEAKER_21]: I would have taken him to... I had this planned for a month and a half.

271
00:24:01,773 --> 00:24:02,013
[SPEAKER_12]: I know.

272
00:24:03,794 --> 00:24:03,974
[SPEAKER_21]: But...

273
00:24:04,773 --> 00:24:06,314
[SPEAKER_15]: You guys all piled in a van, right?

274
00:24:06,435 --> 00:24:11,499
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, Vandalist took us in his van, his SUV.

275
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:15,323
[SPEAKER_21]: It was a comfy SUV, too, and I sort of slept on the way back.

276
00:24:17,044 --> 00:24:23,110
[SPEAKER_21]: But it was a really fun time, and it was funny watching the skanks try to out-skank each other.

277
00:24:24,070 --> 00:24:26,112
[SPEAKER_21]: This one girl decided that she had to dance every time.

278
00:24:26,132 --> 00:24:29,996
[SPEAKER_21]: She was like, sit your stupid skinny butt down, you're ugly.

279
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:32,820
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you say she was ugly?

280
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,961
[SPEAKER_21]: No, we just were like, Hey, down in front!

281
00:24:35,041 --> 00:24:37,723
[SPEAKER_21]: And she's like, Oh, I'm sorry, I'm stupid.

282
00:24:38,183 --> 00:24:38,643
[SPEAKER_21]: And sat down.

283
00:24:40,264 --> 00:24:43,146
[SPEAKER_21]: But he did... He changed the Yoda chant.

284
00:24:44,166 --> 00:24:46,868
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, not really changed it, but more like expanded it.

285
00:24:46,888 --> 00:24:47,488
[SPEAKER_21]: It was pretty cool.

286
00:24:47,528 --> 00:24:49,329
[SPEAKER_15]: And for those that don't know what the Yoda chant is?

287
00:24:49,770 --> 00:24:52,111
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't remember how to do the whole Yoda chant.

288
00:24:52,391 --> 00:24:54,372
[SPEAKER_21]: If you've been to a Weird Al show, you know the Yoda chant.

289
00:24:56,413 --> 00:24:56,894
[SPEAKER_21]: He did...

290
00:24:58,070 --> 00:25:04,274
[SPEAKER_21]: He did that stupid... He did the stinky song that was making fun of that stupid person Nelly.

291
00:25:05,736 --> 00:25:06,216
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, yeah.

292
00:25:06,236 --> 00:25:07,657
[SPEAKER_12]: That guy I hate.

293
00:25:08,758 --> 00:25:12,620
[SPEAKER_12]: It's getting hot in here, so take off all your clothes.

294
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:13,181
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I know that one.

295
00:25:13,201 --> 00:25:14,762
[SPEAKER_21]: They put a bunch of trash cans on the stage.

296
00:25:14,822 --> 00:25:15,302
[SPEAKER_21]: It was great.

297
00:25:15,883 --> 00:25:17,084
[SPEAKER_21]: And they did All About the Pentiums.

298
00:25:18,945 --> 00:25:21,206
[SPEAKER_21]: And did, of course, One More Minute.

299
00:25:21,226 --> 00:25:22,888
[SPEAKER_12]: Is it just me or is Weird Al getting old?

300
00:25:23,848 --> 00:25:24,309
[SPEAKER_21]: Shut up.

301
00:25:24,589 --> 00:25:24,749
Shut up.

302
00:25:25,422 --> 00:25:27,124
[SPEAKER_15]: Is he, is he, he's got a baby.

303
00:25:27,424 --> 00:25:29,025
[SPEAKER_15]: I know, well he didn't have the baby.

304
00:25:29,125 --> 00:25:30,266
[SPEAKER_03]: Well his wife had the baby.

305
00:25:30,767 --> 00:25:35,250
[SPEAKER_15]: But still like I saw him in an interview recently and I'm like, weird how he's getting old.

306
00:25:35,811 --> 00:25:36,672
[SPEAKER_15]: It was weird.

307
00:25:37,392 --> 00:25:38,373
[SPEAKER_21]: You're getting old too.

308
00:25:38,593 --> 00:25:41,976
[SPEAKER_15]: I know, we're all getting old, but he's getting like really old.

309
00:25:42,677 --> 00:25:44,718
[SPEAKER_15]: I still kind of look like my yearbook picture.

310
00:25:44,738 --> 00:25:46,400
[SPEAKER_21]: He doesn't look very old at all.

311
00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:49,802
[SPEAKER_21]: He did the funniest, he did some of his parody interviews.

312
00:25:50,362 --> 00:25:50,662
[SPEAKER_15]: Uh-huh.

313
00:25:50,962 --> 00:25:53,924
[SPEAKER_15]: He did, um... I'm moving out in the living room so people can see me on webcam if they want.

314
00:25:53,984 --> 00:26:01,148
[SPEAKER_21]: He did one with, uh, with Justin Timberlake and Brittany on the TV.

315
00:26:01,208 --> 00:26:01,788
[SPEAKER_21]: It was great.

316
00:26:01,888 --> 00:26:03,849
[SPEAKER_02]: Justin Timberlake is such a suck.

317
00:26:03,869 --> 00:26:05,710
[SPEAKER_21]: The best one was the Celine Dion one.

318
00:26:06,071 --> 00:26:06,371
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, shit.

319
00:26:06,411 --> 00:26:13,975
[SPEAKER_21]: He's like, well, I know when you were a child you had this traumatic experience where you're going skiing and your whole family was eaten by cannibals.

320
00:26:14,475 --> 00:26:17,417
[SPEAKER_21]: He's like, yes, I remember the smell of my mother cooking.

321
00:26:17,957 --> 00:26:19,718
[SPEAKER_21]: He's like, I bet it was horrible for you.

322
00:26:20,058 --> 00:26:20,839
[SPEAKER_21]: No, it was fun.

323
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:24,380
[SPEAKER_21]: And the Avril Lavigne one.

324
00:26:25,341 --> 00:26:27,142
[SPEAKER_21]: He's like, say something incoherently for us.

325
00:26:27,382 --> 00:26:29,343
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, I don't think, you know, she's going off on something.

326
00:26:29,363 --> 00:26:30,064
[SPEAKER_21]: It was really great.

327
00:26:31,284 --> 00:26:33,906
[SPEAKER_21]: And it was, the interviews were great.

328
00:26:34,366 --> 00:26:37,288
[SPEAKER_21]: You know, this is actually, I think the one tonight is his last show of the tour.

329
00:26:38,408 --> 00:26:38,668
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, yeah.

330
00:26:38,688 --> 00:26:39,869
[SPEAKER_21]: So all you people missed out.

331
00:26:42,381 --> 00:26:44,242
[SPEAKER_15]: Here's Jamie's chance to rub it in.

332
00:26:46,964 --> 00:26:47,664
[SPEAKER_21]: With a ferret.

333
00:26:49,525 --> 00:26:53,568
[SPEAKER_15]: So, Weird Al, skanks, good songs, good time.

334
00:26:54,028 --> 00:26:56,090
[SPEAKER_21]: I have pictures, and I took pictures of the fireworks.

335
00:26:56,110 --> 00:26:58,471
[SPEAKER_15]: Tell me about where you guys went to eat, because this is a funny story.

336
00:26:59,071 --> 00:27:00,072
[SPEAKER_03]: We ate at IHOP.

337
00:27:00,873 --> 00:27:02,053
[SPEAKER_03]: I told you about IHOP.

338
00:27:02,113 --> 00:27:02,914
[SPEAKER_03]: You told me about it.

339
00:27:03,034 --> 00:27:03,554
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you tell them?

340
00:27:03,614 --> 00:27:05,115
[SPEAKER_21]: I said it's the happiest place on Earth.

341
00:27:05,175 --> 00:27:06,156
[SPEAKER_21]: I said it's the only thing.

342
00:27:06,616 --> 00:27:07,797
[SPEAKER_21]: But you didn't let me finish.

343
00:27:09,631 --> 00:27:14,134
[SPEAKER_21]: and I hope it was the happiest place on earth because it looked like happy up and threw up all over it.

344
00:27:15,035 --> 00:27:18,358
[SPEAKER_21]: It's like happy decided to pop and go, oh, I'm happy, happy, puke.

345
00:27:19,218 --> 00:27:20,979
[SPEAKER_21]: And the whole place was covered in happy faces.

346
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:22,020
[SPEAKER_15]: So it looked like a Walmart.

347
00:27:22,481 --> 00:27:22,781
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah.

348
00:27:23,161 --> 00:27:24,942
[SPEAKER_15]: Walmart is not a happy place to sleep.

349
00:27:25,062 --> 00:27:29,386
[SPEAKER_21]: It made Walmart look like the sewer.

350
00:27:31,269 --> 00:27:33,990
[SPEAKER_15]: The rat-infested sewer that it is.

351
00:27:34,070 --> 00:27:35,131
[SPEAKER_21]: With skanks.

352
00:27:35,191 --> 00:27:36,832
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll talk about that later, much later.

353
00:27:38,072 --> 00:27:39,333
[SPEAKER_15]: I have issues with Walmart this week.

354
00:27:40,814 --> 00:27:42,735
[SPEAKER_21]: But it was too happy.

355
00:27:42,795 --> 00:27:49,518
[SPEAKER_21]: And then today, we got home at like 3.30, long enough for me to do a little post-lit in my live journal.

356
00:27:49,538 --> 00:27:51,839
[SPEAKER_21]: And then I passed out and was dead for...

357
00:27:52,403 --> 00:27:52,984
[SPEAKER_21]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

358
00:28:15,265 --> 00:28:15,765
[SPEAKER_15]: Smiley face.

359
00:28:16,225 --> 00:28:17,605
[SPEAKER_21]: And it had pumpkin syrup.

360
00:28:18,266 --> 00:28:18,946
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, it was so good.

361
00:28:19,706 --> 00:28:20,166
[SPEAKER_15]: So today?

362
00:28:20,946 --> 00:28:22,446
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, pumpkin.

363
00:28:22,907 --> 00:28:24,807
[SPEAKER_21]: Today, I felt like shit.

364
00:28:25,427 --> 00:28:28,628
[SPEAKER_21]: I felt like shit when I went home because I'm still sick and I shouldn't have gone.

365
00:28:29,268 --> 00:28:31,268
[SPEAKER_21]: And I had to go along the livestock.

366
00:28:31,288 --> 00:28:32,629
[SPEAKER_21]: But I got to shoot a man yesterday.

367
00:28:33,529 --> 00:28:34,169
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, yeah.

368
00:28:34,389 --> 00:28:36,509
[SPEAKER_15]: You shot a guy like 33 times?

369
00:28:36,709 --> 00:28:37,730
[SPEAKER_21]: They had a paintball thing.

370
00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:39,530
[SPEAKER_21]: And I was shooting little targets.

371
00:28:39,550 --> 00:28:40,570
[SPEAKER_21]: I shot a bunny in the head.

372
00:28:41,630 --> 00:28:44,731
[SPEAKER_21]: And I shot a teddy bear in the ass.

373
00:28:46,057 --> 00:28:53,402
[SPEAKER_21]: I was shooting all the small targets and then I decided to use my last 20 or so shots on the man himself who was just standing there all padded up.

374
00:28:54,023 --> 00:28:54,763
[SPEAKER_21]: I got him in the head.

375
00:28:54,783 --> 00:28:56,184
[SPEAKER_21]: And it was a real guy?

376
00:28:56,204 --> 00:28:56,965
[SPEAKER_21]: Real guy.

377
00:28:57,005 --> 00:28:58,466
[SPEAKER_21]: All bundled up in paintball gear.

378
00:28:58,946 --> 00:28:59,647
[SPEAKER_21]: I shot him in the head.

379
00:29:00,947 --> 00:29:01,728
[SPEAKER_21]: I shot him in his heart.

380
00:29:02,388 --> 00:29:03,369
[SPEAKER_21]: I shot him in his groin.

381
00:29:04,110 --> 00:29:07,292
[SPEAKER_21]: I shot him in the right kneecap enough to make him back up a step.

382
00:29:08,633 --> 00:29:11,835
[SPEAKER_21]: And then I shot him a bunch of other places and I think I shot him in the eyeball once.

383
00:29:12,555 --> 00:29:14,016
[SPEAKER_21]: But he was wearing goggles so it wasn't much fun.

384
00:29:14,036 --> 00:29:14,957
[SPEAKER_10]: Hmm.

385
00:29:15,478 --> 00:29:16,578
[SPEAKER_21]: I was like, oh, no more?

386
00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:20,880
[SPEAKER_02]: Wasn't there a little heckler there, too, that was telling you to shut up?

387
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:22,241
[SPEAKER_21]: I told him to shut up.

388
00:29:22,581 --> 00:29:23,421
[SPEAKER_21]: Some stupid little kid.

389
00:29:23,441 --> 00:29:24,582
[SPEAKER_15]: You can curse on Orange Hawn's radio.

390
00:29:24,622 --> 00:29:24,862
[SPEAKER_15]: It's okay.

391
00:29:24,882 --> 00:29:25,902
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't feel like cursing.

392
00:29:26,042 --> 00:29:27,943
[SPEAKER_21]: I feel like being clean today because I'm sick.

393
00:29:28,924 --> 00:29:31,104
[SPEAKER_21]: You know I'm sick when I'm talking like a good little girl.

394
00:29:31,485 --> 00:29:31,965
[SPEAKER_21]: Fuck him.

395
00:29:32,845 --> 00:29:34,046
[SPEAKER_21]: Stupid little kid, okay?

396
00:29:34,566 --> 00:29:35,246
[SPEAKER_21]: Stupid little kid.

397
00:29:36,627 --> 00:29:37,327
[SPEAKER_21]: You can hit it.

398
00:29:37,467 --> 00:29:37,947
[SPEAKER_21]: Hit the guy.

399
00:29:37,967 --> 00:29:38,227
[SPEAKER_21]: Hit the guy.

400
00:29:38,247 --> 00:29:38,948
[SPEAKER_21]: Don't hit the little things.

401
00:29:38,968 --> 00:29:39,328
[SPEAKER_21]: Hit the guy.

402
00:29:39,388 --> 00:29:39,788
[SPEAKER_21]: Hit the man.

403
00:29:39,848 --> 00:29:41,149
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm like, okay.

404
00:29:41,169 --> 00:29:41,749
[SPEAKER_21]: This was while...

405
00:29:42,879 --> 00:29:43,739
[SPEAKER_21]: Vandalis is going.

406
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:47,581
[SPEAKER_21]: I told the kid, okay, don't talk when I'm shooting or I'll shoot you.

407
00:29:48,201 --> 00:29:48,841
[SPEAKER_21]: I didn't say that.

408
00:29:48,861 --> 00:29:52,102
[SPEAKER_21]: I was like, do me a favor, kid, don't talk when I'm shooting.

409
00:29:52,622 --> 00:29:53,323
[SPEAKER_21]: But it's fine.

410
00:29:53,343 --> 00:29:54,783
[SPEAKER_21]: I was like, no, it's not.

411
00:29:54,823 --> 00:29:57,404
[SPEAKER_15]: I would have turned that gun right around and opened fire.

412
00:29:57,784 --> 00:30:00,305
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, the thing was so touchy.

413
00:30:00,745 --> 00:30:02,406
[SPEAKER_21]: I could have had that thing go, die.

414
00:30:04,432 --> 00:30:05,693
[SPEAKER_21]: It was a very touchy gun.

415
00:30:06,594 --> 00:30:07,795
[SPEAKER_21]: But we all shot people.

416
00:30:07,915 --> 00:30:08,296
[SPEAKER_21]: It was good.

417
00:30:08,496 --> 00:30:11,098
[SPEAKER_15]: I've done that with a water gun, but they only turn so far.

418
00:30:11,398 --> 00:30:16,142
[SPEAKER_15]: You can't really shoot your neighbor, but you can get a stream going kind of sideways, and you can flick water on your neighbor.

419
00:30:16,183 --> 00:30:20,026
[SPEAKER_21]: I could have pulled this thing completely out and gone on a murderous paintball rampage.

420
00:30:20,987 --> 00:30:21,807
[SPEAKER_21]: Why would you?

421
00:30:22,548 --> 00:30:24,730
[SPEAKER_21]: Because there weren't enough children around.

422
00:30:24,770 --> 00:30:27,512
[SPEAKER_21]: Just that one kid, and he wasn't worth me wasting the ammo I paid for.

423
00:30:27,532 --> 00:30:29,214
[SPEAKER_21]: So, um...

424
00:30:31,724 --> 00:30:34,126
[SPEAKER_21]: It was a good time, and today I felt really, really crappy.

425
00:30:34,146 --> 00:30:42,611
[SPEAKER_21]: I took a picture of a cow that was acting like a cat, hunched down like Shermie does, turning around and licking his shoulder.

426
00:30:42,891 --> 00:30:46,053
[SPEAKER_21]: When Licklick, I'm cute, I think I'm a cat, but I'm really a cow, boo.

427
00:30:47,334 --> 00:30:49,995
[SPEAKER_21]: And we came up with retarded animal sounds.

428
00:30:50,736 --> 00:30:51,256
[SPEAKER_17]: Moo!

429
00:30:52,677 --> 00:30:53,017
[SPEAKER_17]: Moo!

430
00:30:54,038 --> 00:30:55,339
[SPEAKER_17]: I think that was... Okay.

431
00:30:56,099 --> 00:31:00,702
[SPEAKER_17]: We were in the IHOP going, yay, and then talking about animals.

432
00:31:01,917 --> 00:31:05,899
[SPEAKER_15]: Somebody was saying earlier in the chat room that Weird Al should be in Bomani.

433
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:06,580
[SPEAKER_15]: No.

434
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,001
[SPEAKER_15]: No, I don't think so either.

435
00:31:08,041 --> 00:31:09,722
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't want Bomani to ruin Weird Al.

436
00:31:10,722 --> 00:31:12,923
[SPEAKER_15]: But Weird Al should do a parody of a Bomani song.

437
00:31:13,664 --> 00:31:13,824
[SPEAKER_21]: No.

438
00:31:14,704 --> 00:31:15,165
[SPEAKER_15]: I think he should.

439
00:31:16,826 --> 00:31:18,487
[SPEAKER_21]: He'd make, like, Love Me Do the Polka.

440
00:31:19,747 --> 00:31:21,348
[SPEAKER_15]: That would be great, a Bomani polka.

441
00:31:21,408 --> 00:31:21,748
[SPEAKER_15]: Come on.

442
00:31:22,229 --> 00:31:23,349
[SPEAKER_15]: Tell me that would not be beautiful.

443
00:31:23,710 --> 00:31:24,570
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't think he'd do it.

444
00:31:29,099 --> 00:31:30,980
[SPEAKER_21]: I, I, I, I'm your little butterfly

445
00:31:57,331 --> 00:32:00,872
[SPEAKER_21]: and Melody took a nap with Shermie.

446
00:32:01,912 --> 00:32:02,092
[SPEAKER_12]: Aww.

447
00:32:02,752 --> 00:32:07,953
[SPEAKER_21]: And I bummed around online and then she went home but she's coming back because her laptop's at my house.

448
00:32:08,833 --> 00:32:13,134
[SPEAKER_15]: So we'll have a special surprise visit from Shark Skrull in a little while.

449
00:32:13,974 --> 00:32:14,614
[SPEAKER_21]: Surprise!

450
00:32:15,375 --> 00:32:17,375
[SPEAKER_21]: Surprise!

451
00:32:17,535 --> 00:32:20,916
[SPEAKER_21]: So I might have to leave a bit early but I'm doing other things here too.

452
00:32:23,366 --> 00:32:25,467
[SPEAKER_21]: Um, yeah, my clothes are visiting, too.

453
00:32:25,827 --> 00:32:27,248
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, LankyStyle has it.

454
00:32:27,288 --> 00:32:29,109
[SPEAKER_15]: He says, Superstar Pokestyle.

455
00:32:29,149 --> 00:32:29,609
[SPEAKER_21]: No!

456
00:32:30,990 --> 00:32:31,270
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

457
00:32:31,330 --> 00:32:32,130
[SPEAKER_03]: My name is Chaos.

458
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:34,191
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm here to do it.

459
00:32:36,412 --> 00:32:39,494
[SPEAKER_03]: That earned you a fap in the head by the ferret.

460
00:32:40,174 --> 00:32:41,475
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you say a fap in the head?

461
00:32:41,495 --> 00:32:42,575
[SPEAKER_03]: I said a fap.

462
00:32:43,275 --> 00:32:44,356
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought she said a fap.

463
00:32:46,079 --> 00:32:47,900
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't expect much out of me, but whining and angst

464
00:33:04,818 --> 00:33:06,800
[SPEAKER_21]: You get wine with your eggs today.

465
00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:08,741
[SPEAKER_16]: What do we expect from you usually?

466
00:33:08,761 --> 00:33:09,242
[SPEAKER_21]: Shut up.

467
00:33:10,563 --> 00:33:12,845
[SPEAKER_21]: Me to be funny and excited and bouncing and cute.

468
00:33:12,905 --> 00:33:13,285
[SPEAKER_21]: And you know what?

469
00:33:13,345 --> 00:33:15,367
[SPEAKER_21]: On top of that, I was so happy.

470
00:33:15,487 --> 00:33:17,789
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, my purse, my little purse is dead, which pissed me off.

471
00:33:18,109 --> 00:33:20,071
[SPEAKER_21]: So I was going to use my bunny, my bunny backpack.

472
00:33:20,231 --> 00:33:21,291
[SPEAKER_21]: My bunny backpack broke.

473
00:33:21,732 --> 00:33:22,272
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, no.

474
00:33:22,573 --> 00:33:24,995
[SPEAKER_21]: So now I have it rigged because it's the only thing I have.

475
00:33:25,015 --> 00:33:25,835
[SPEAKER_21]: I have to go buy a new purse.

476
00:33:25,855 --> 00:33:26,536
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't have any money.

477
00:33:27,176 --> 00:33:29,478
[SPEAKER_21]: And I have to put it on the credit card probably because I need a purse.

478
00:33:29,678 --> 00:33:32,681
[SPEAKER_21]: And Matt's humping the chair.

479
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:36,041
[SPEAKER_15]: He's fapping the chair.

480
00:33:36,141 --> 00:33:37,462
[SPEAKER_21]: You're fapping the chair.

481
00:33:38,883 --> 00:33:40,564
[SPEAKER_03]: You were faced the other way.

482
00:33:45,047 --> 00:33:47,809
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, John Fields suggests a bye-bye baby balloon polka.

483
00:33:47,829 --> 00:33:49,371
[SPEAKER_15]: A polka polka.

484
00:33:49,671 --> 00:33:49,951
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

485
00:33:50,031 --> 00:33:51,052
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't have energy.

486
00:33:51,072 --> 00:33:51,532
[SPEAKER_15]: Stand up.

487
00:34:03,445 --> 00:34:04,986
[SPEAKER_15]: No, no, nobody's love.

488
00:34:05,106 --> 00:34:06,007
[SPEAKER_15]: Stand up.

489
00:34:06,227 --> 00:34:06,808
[SPEAKER_02]: Stand up.

490
00:34:06,828 --> 00:34:07,268
[SPEAKER_02]: Why?

491
00:34:07,488 --> 00:34:07,929
[SPEAKER_02]: Stand up.

492
00:34:07,949 --> 00:34:08,849
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to stand up.

493
00:34:08,869 --> 00:34:09,270
[SPEAKER_02]: Stand up.

494
00:34:09,550 --> 00:34:10,010
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

495
00:34:10,110 --> 00:34:10,531
[SPEAKER_02]: Stand up.

496
00:34:10,931 --> 00:34:11,872
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm standing up.

497
00:34:13,874 --> 00:34:13,994
[SPEAKER_02]: Ow.

498
00:34:17,717 --> 00:34:18,337
[SPEAKER_21]: No polka.

499
00:34:19,218 --> 00:34:20,819
[SPEAKER_21]: I only want polka.

500
00:34:20,979 --> 00:34:21,960
[SPEAKER_12]: I want a joga polka.

501
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:22,200
[SPEAKER_21]: Come on.

502
00:34:22,220 --> 00:34:23,321
[SPEAKER_21]: I want trance polka.

503
00:34:25,583 --> 00:34:27,024
[SPEAKER_21]: The beauty of silence polka.

504
00:34:27,545 --> 00:34:28,485
[SPEAKER_03]: The beauty of polka.

505
00:34:32,082 --> 00:34:33,323
[SPEAKER_15]: That's a remix you should do.

506
00:34:35,604 --> 00:34:37,125
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm sorry, I don't make crap.

507
00:34:40,227 --> 00:34:41,228
[SPEAKER_15]: Is T-Dog listening?

508
00:34:41,268 --> 00:34:43,169
[SPEAKER_15]: Maybe he could make Beauty and Polka.

509
00:34:45,951 --> 00:34:46,751
[SPEAKER_15]: Don't put it past him.

510
00:34:46,771 --> 00:34:48,092
[SPEAKER_15]: That's my new name, T-Dog.

511
00:34:48,772 --> 00:34:50,954
[SPEAKER_02]: What, for the four-letter word?

512
00:34:51,014 --> 00:34:51,294
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

513
00:34:51,914 --> 00:34:52,255
[SPEAKER_02]: Mute!

514
00:34:57,466 --> 00:34:57,826
[SPEAKER_15]: Anyway.

515
00:34:58,307 --> 00:34:59,547
[SPEAKER_17]: Hi, Newt!

516
00:34:59,647 --> 00:35:01,588
[SPEAKER_15]: Is that all you have to say about your day and your week?

517
00:35:01,989 --> 00:35:03,770
[SPEAKER_17]: I think I have a fever again.

518
00:35:03,790 --> 00:35:05,111
[SPEAKER_17]: I have to go to work tomorrow.

519
00:35:06,611 --> 00:35:07,352
[SPEAKER_15]: You don't have to.

520
00:35:07,372 --> 00:35:08,012
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, I do.

521
00:35:08,032 --> 00:35:09,413
[SPEAKER_15]: Unless you want to get fired.

522
00:35:10,554 --> 00:35:12,355
[SPEAKER_21]: I have a doctor's excuse though, so nah.

523
00:35:14,076 --> 00:35:15,136
[SPEAKER_21]: And I'm on lots of drugs.

524
00:35:16,397 --> 00:35:18,438
[SPEAKER_21]: I have to snort liquid cocaine.

525
00:35:18,679 --> 00:35:19,099
[SPEAKER_12]: Cool.

526
00:35:19,339 --> 00:35:20,660
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't know, it's called Nazarel.

527
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:21,680
[SPEAKER_21]: It's like burns.

528
00:35:23,361 --> 00:35:26,043
[SPEAKER_21]: It's like inhaling snot, but on fire.

529
00:35:27,734 --> 00:35:28,494
[SPEAKER_21]: It's really disgusting.

530
00:35:28,515 --> 00:35:31,736
[SPEAKER_15]: Ferb is criticizing my pronunciation of Dom Dariam.

531
00:35:32,797 --> 00:35:34,098
[SPEAKER_21]: It's Dom Dariram.

532
00:35:34,538 --> 00:35:35,459
[SPEAKER_15]: Dom Dariram?

533
00:35:36,719 --> 00:35:37,640
[SPEAKER_15]: Dom Dariam?

534
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:39,121
[SPEAKER_15]: How about Dom Dariam?

535
00:35:39,561 --> 00:35:40,021
[SPEAKER_15]: No.

536
00:35:40,061 --> 00:35:40,582
[SPEAKER_15]: Dariam.

537
00:35:40,682 --> 00:35:43,243
[SPEAKER_15]: I like Dariam because it sounds like Darier.

538
00:35:43,263 --> 00:35:44,584
[SPEAKER_21]: It's a stupid yoga song.

539
00:35:45,344 --> 00:35:46,265
[SPEAKER_21]: Stupid yoga song.

540
00:35:48,486 --> 00:35:49,767
[SPEAKER_15]: From now on... You know what?

541
00:35:50,147 --> 00:35:55,050
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't care if my pronunciation of Dom Dariam was a little odd and wrong because the British say everything odd.

542
00:35:55,150 --> 00:35:56,171
[SPEAKER_15]: So, you know what?

543
00:35:56,932 --> 00:35:57,672
[SPEAKER_21]: Shut up!

544
00:35:58,072 --> 00:35:58,853
[SPEAKER_21]: That's mean.

545
00:36:00,813 --> 00:36:01,553
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm just kidding.

546
00:36:02,213 --> 00:36:03,134
[SPEAKER_21]: Someone kick Rob.

547
00:36:03,634 --> 00:36:04,154
[SPEAKER_21]: You're closer.

548
00:36:04,194 --> 00:36:04,774
[SPEAKER_21]: Kick Rob for me.

549
00:36:05,154 --> 00:36:05,534
[SPEAKER_15]: No.

550
00:36:06,895 --> 00:36:07,115
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

551
00:36:08,215 --> 00:36:12,356
[SPEAKER_15]: Anyway, let's go on to Loki.

552
00:36:12,396 --> 00:36:13,637
[SPEAKER_15]: If you're done talking about your weekend.

553
00:36:13,657 --> 00:36:14,777
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm going to go tickle my laundry.

554
00:36:15,277 --> 00:36:15,557
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

555
00:36:15,937 --> 00:36:17,718
[SPEAKER_15]: I think your wash is done because I don't hear it spinning anymore.

556
00:36:18,258 --> 00:36:19,358
[SPEAKER_15]: In the meantime, we'll talk to Loki.

557
00:36:20,078 --> 00:36:21,159
[SPEAKER_15]: Loki, how was your weekend?

558
00:36:22,059 --> 00:36:22,639
[SPEAKER_15]: It was all right.

559
00:36:22,659 --> 00:36:23,599
[SPEAKER_15]: I didn't do anything.

560
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:25,400
[SPEAKER_15]: Sat there.

561
00:36:26,229 --> 00:36:27,249
[SPEAKER_15]: Rodding away at work.

562
00:36:30,090 --> 00:36:31,431
[SPEAKER_15]: I won spinners tonight.

563
00:36:31,751 --> 00:36:33,771
[SPEAKER_15]: Those are going to be for my Beatmania controller.

564
00:36:33,931 --> 00:36:34,772
[SPEAKER_15]: And what is a spinner?

565
00:36:35,732 --> 00:36:36,592
[SPEAKER_15]: It's exactly that.

566
00:36:36,652 --> 00:36:37,312
[SPEAKER_15]: It spins.

567
00:36:37,672 --> 00:36:38,393
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a little controller.

568
00:36:38,413 --> 00:36:38,973
[SPEAKER_15]: Like a top?

569
00:36:40,473 --> 00:36:41,073
[SPEAKER_15]: Like a knob.

570
00:36:43,134 --> 00:36:44,134
[SPEAKER_15]: It spins like a knob.

571
00:36:44,294 --> 00:36:45,155
[SPEAKER_15]: You bought a knob.

572
00:36:46,235 --> 00:36:46,835
[SPEAKER_15]: Two knobs.

573
00:36:49,016 --> 00:36:56,018
[SPEAKER_15]: Anyways, so I bought those and then pretty much worked on my pads a little bit

574
00:36:56,485 --> 00:36:57,867
[SPEAKER_15]: Have all the metal bent on them now.

575
00:36:59,169 --> 00:37:03,094
[SPEAKER_15]: And made a remix, did some show.

576
00:37:03,734 --> 00:37:05,557
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, we have a new Loki remix coming soon.

577
00:37:06,318 --> 00:37:07,920
[SPEAKER_15]: Tonight, at some point, yes?

578
00:37:08,020 --> 00:37:08,841
[SPEAKER_15]: I already finished it.

579
00:37:09,061 --> 00:37:10,243
[SPEAKER_15]: I finished it during the show.

580
00:37:10,864 --> 00:37:11,805
[SPEAKER_15]: Maybe next break then.

581
00:37:12,685 --> 00:37:13,406
[SPEAKER_15]: Maybe.

582
00:37:13,426 --> 00:37:14,066
[SPEAKER_15]: Maybe.

583
00:37:14,366 --> 00:37:14,627
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright.

584
00:37:14,827 --> 00:37:19,090
[SPEAKER_15]: I dedicated it to the Thunder Mountain Railroad train that crashed.

585
00:37:20,871 --> 00:37:21,391
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

586
00:37:22,052 --> 00:37:26,535
[SPEAKER_15]: So we have the whatever song it's going to be, Big Thunder Mountain Mix, or what is this?

587
00:37:27,016 --> 00:37:27,896
[SPEAKER_15]: I like that one better.

588
00:37:27,916 --> 00:37:29,457
[SPEAKER_15]: I want to change it.

589
00:37:30,258 --> 00:37:35,042
[SPEAKER_15]: It was just going to be called Derailed Mix, but I like the Big Thunder Mountain Mix.

590
00:37:35,362 --> 00:37:36,983
[SPEAKER_15]: How many of your remixes have I named?

591
00:37:37,003 --> 00:37:37,303
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

592
00:37:38,624 --> 00:37:40,285
[SPEAKER_15]: This is at least the second or third one.

593
00:37:40,725 --> 00:37:41,586
[SPEAKER_15]: I named another one.

594
00:37:42,306 --> 00:37:43,167
[SPEAKER_15]: There was another one I named.

595
00:37:43,307 --> 00:37:44,528
[SPEAKER_15]: It was the Matrix one.

596
00:37:45,368 --> 00:37:46,049
[SPEAKER_15]: Gravity Reloaded.

597
00:37:47,610 --> 00:37:47,730
[SPEAKER_15]: Eh.

598
00:37:48,030 --> 00:37:48,810
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, uh-huh.

599
00:37:49,431 --> 00:37:49,791
[SPEAKER_11]: I rule.

600
00:37:49,951 --> 00:37:51,032
[SPEAKER_15]: You just don't want to admit it.

601
00:37:51,052 --> 00:37:51,392
[SPEAKER_15]: Whatever.

602
00:37:52,489 --> 00:37:59,171
[SPEAKER_15]: I have money, I have to go buy the... I was shopping for a computer today for my MAME cabinet and then that was expensive so I didn't buy it.

603
00:37:59,371 --> 00:38:02,773
[SPEAKER_15]: And then I was going to shop for parts online for the MAME cabinet.

604
00:38:03,313 --> 00:38:05,073
[SPEAKER_15]: That was also expensive so I didn't buy it.

605
00:38:05,413 --> 00:38:11,015
[SPEAKER_15]: And so pretty much it's just pricing stuff right now and working on it and that kind of thing.

606
00:38:11,395 --> 00:38:15,517
[SPEAKER_15]: But anyways... Mikey Style says a spinner is a short, thin girl.

607
00:38:22,615 --> 00:38:24,196
[SPEAKER_15]: Loki buying that online?

608
00:38:24,276 --> 00:38:24,616
[SPEAKER_15]: Never.

609
00:38:25,456 --> 00:38:26,096
[SPEAKER_15]: And two of them.

610
00:38:27,497 --> 00:38:32,738
[SPEAKER_15]: No, but, um... No, Loki was talking about how he bought spinners online, and LankyStyle says, a spinner is a short, thin girl.

611
00:38:35,059 --> 00:38:40,160
[SPEAKER_15]: Because you can spin her in your lap when she's riding your cock.

612
00:38:44,282 --> 00:38:45,702
[SPEAKER_15]: Anyways... You don't have a cock!

613
00:38:46,742 --> 00:38:51,984
[SPEAKER_21]: No, but, uh... I resent that...

614
00:38:52,947 --> 00:38:58,729
[SPEAKER_21]: Because one day I'm going to invent the one that, like, women can have that... I don't... Okay.

615
00:38:59,510 --> 00:39:01,470
[SPEAKER_15]: My friend... They already have cocks for women.

616
00:39:01,930 --> 00:39:02,751
[SPEAKER_15]: The vagina cock?

617
00:39:03,211 --> 00:39:03,511
[SPEAKER_21]: No.

618
00:39:03,931 --> 00:39:13,515
[SPEAKER_21]: I have... Well, she's not really a friend, I guess, anymore, but this girl that I know who's really irresponsible and is kind of stupid, she said she wanted a dick so that she could whip it out and piss on people.

619
00:39:14,648 --> 00:39:17,189
[SPEAKER_15]: All right, we know what happens when people wish for dicks, okay?

620
00:39:17,389 --> 00:39:18,650
[SPEAKER_15]: We've already watched that movie.

621
00:39:18,730 --> 00:39:19,210
[SPEAKER_19]: I haven't.

622
00:39:19,370 --> 00:39:19,990
[SPEAKER_15]: You know what, though?

623
00:39:20,310 --> 00:39:22,031
[SPEAKER_15]: Having a dick, it isn't all that.

624
00:39:22,071 --> 00:39:25,892
[SPEAKER_15]: Because when you get a dick, yes, when you get a dick, you get balls as well.

625
00:39:25,952 --> 00:39:27,073
[SPEAKER_15]: And people can kick you there.

626
00:39:27,493 --> 00:39:29,774
[SPEAKER_15]: And imagine, like, your entire three days.

627
00:39:29,814 --> 00:39:31,414
[SPEAKER_21]: I've often said it's much better to be a woman.

628
00:39:31,474 --> 00:39:36,256
[SPEAKER_15]: Imagine your whole three days' worth of cramps piled into five seconds of intense pain.

629
00:39:37,397 --> 00:39:38,977
[SPEAKER_15]: That's what being kicked in the balls feels like.

630
00:39:39,197 --> 00:39:40,858
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, but the five seconds goes away.

631
00:39:42,731 --> 00:39:44,372
[SPEAKER_21]: And you have no idea what cramps feel like.

632
00:39:45,793 --> 00:39:48,734
[SPEAKER_21]: Imagine having pain that makes you puke.

633
00:39:49,195 --> 00:39:51,156
[SPEAKER_15]: Somebody once told me what having a baby felt like.

634
00:39:51,976 --> 00:39:53,817
[SPEAKER_15]: It's like pulling your lower lip over your head.

635
00:39:54,958 --> 00:39:56,679
[SPEAKER_15]: That's what somebody told me once.

636
00:39:56,819 --> 00:40:00,461
[SPEAKER_15]: It's like a family guy freaking loser.

637
00:40:00,581 --> 00:40:08,285
[SPEAKER_21]: There was a movie that described it as trying to push something the size of a watermelon out of a hole the size of a pea.

638
00:40:09,606 --> 00:40:10,466
[SPEAKER_15]: I think it was a lemon.

639
00:40:10,847 --> 00:40:11,427
[SPEAKER_21]: A lemon, yeah.

640
00:40:12,020 --> 00:40:12,961
[SPEAKER_15]: That was Chase and Amy.

641
00:40:14,422 --> 00:40:16,163
[SPEAKER_21]: Giving birth sucks and I'm never going to do it.

642
00:40:16,183 --> 00:40:19,546
[SPEAKER_15]: That's why they cut open your stomach and pull the damn kid out.

643
00:40:19,626 --> 00:40:21,227
[SPEAKER_15]: It's just like, what the hell's the point?

644
00:40:21,287 --> 00:40:25,711
[SPEAKER_15]: It's like trying to shove a piano through a door when there's a perfectly good window right there.

645
00:40:29,634 --> 00:40:32,396
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, I don't see the point.

646
00:40:34,617 --> 00:40:36,479
[SPEAKER_21]: And that's why men will never have babies.

647
00:40:36,839 --> 00:40:39,281
[SPEAKER_16]: The genius of Loki on Orange Lounge Radio.

648
00:40:40,942 --> 00:40:41,463
[SPEAKER_21]: You know what?

649
00:40:43,101 --> 00:40:44,042
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you for watching!

650
00:40:57,421 --> 00:41:00,983
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, because she has something wrong with her pituitary gland or something like that.

651
00:41:01,063 --> 00:41:05,806
[SPEAKER_15]: It's causing her cells, and I quote, went crazy.

652
00:41:06,886 --> 00:41:12,029
[SPEAKER_15]: And so they're like, that affects how much your blood's produced and like other crap like that.

653
00:41:12,529 --> 00:41:15,031
[SPEAKER_15]: So they have to operate or possibly treat in medication.

654
00:41:15,871 --> 00:41:16,111
[SPEAKER_21]: Ouch.

655
00:41:18,252 --> 00:41:18,733
[SPEAKER_15]: Sure it is.

656
00:41:19,833 --> 00:41:20,674
[SPEAKER_21]: How is that funny?

657
00:41:20,894 --> 00:41:21,334
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know.

658
00:41:22,995 --> 00:41:24,936
[SPEAKER_15]: It's not life-threatening, so it's not bad.

659
00:41:26,255 --> 00:41:30,918
[SPEAKER_21]: I would imagine having someone operate on your brain itself is life-threatening.

660
00:41:32,358 --> 00:41:33,659
[SPEAKER_21]: Would you like... Oh, hi!

661
00:41:33,699 --> 00:41:35,980
[SPEAKER_21]: We're going to open your head and poke with your brain.

662
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:36,741
[SPEAKER_21]: It doesn't hurt.

663
00:41:36,761 --> 00:41:37,501
[SPEAKER_15]: It kind of tickles.

664
00:41:38,542 --> 00:41:39,562
[SPEAKER_21]: And you've had brain surgery.

665
00:41:39,602 --> 00:41:40,343
[SPEAKER_21]: That would explain it.

666
00:41:40,903 --> 00:41:42,104
[SPEAKER_21]: That would explain a few things.

667
00:41:42,844 --> 00:41:43,124
[SPEAKER_15]: No.

668
00:41:45,285 --> 00:41:50,748
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, so not much going on other than my birthday this week, but, you know... Happy birthday!

669
00:41:51,008 --> 00:41:52,209
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, it hasn't occurred yet.

670
00:41:52,705 --> 00:41:54,406
[SPEAKER_15]: 9-11 is when my birthday is.

671
00:41:54,986 --> 00:42:00,087
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm thinking in advance because I might be over here.

672
00:42:00,167 --> 00:42:10,790
[SPEAKER_15]: I went ahead and we kind of had a little party for me on Saturday because my mom is going to be out of town for both my birthday and my sister's birthday.

673
00:42:10,810 --> 00:42:14,772
[SPEAKER_15]: It kind of lumped us all together and did all that kind of thing.

674
00:42:14,812 --> 00:42:15,952
[SPEAKER_21]: Happy collective birthday.

675
00:42:16,610 --> 00:42:18,952
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, and so that was kind of cool.

676
00:42:19,192 --> 00:42:21,374
[SPEAKER_15]: And then I don't know what's going on this week.

677
00:42:21,394 --> 00:42:24,036
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm supposed to go out to dinner with my girlfriend on Thursday.

678
00:42:24,917 --> 00:42:26,719
[SPEAKER_15]: And yeah, that's about it.

679
00:42:30,061 --> 00:42:30,462
[SPEAKER_15]: My turn.

680
00:42:31,548 --> 00:42:34,989
[SPEAKER_15]: My week was kind of shitty because I was, like Jamie, I was sick.

681
00:42:35,089 --> 00:42:39,551
[SPEAKER_15]: I didn't have quite the multiple layers of infection that she had in the end.

682
00:42:39,571 --> 00:42:40,811
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh yeah, I had a sinus infection too.

683
00:42:41,352 --> 00:42:43,052
[SPEAKER_21]: And they tested me for strep throat, but I don't have it.

684
00:42:43,352 --> 00:42:46,953
[SPEAKER_15]: I was just feeling like shit, and it wasn't to the point where I'm like, I gotta go to a doctor.

685
00:42:47,274 --> 00:42:52,335
[SPEAKER_15]: Because I just went to the doctor a couple weeks ago for something else, and after that whole experience I didn't want to go back for a while.

686
00:42:52,876 --> 00:42:53,456
[SPEAKER_15]: So, um...

687
00:42:54,817 --> 00:42:56,578
[SPEAKER_15]: I just kind of slept it off.

688
00:42:56,658 --> 00:43:01,302
[SPEAKER_15]: Like, literally, I went to work, I would come home, nap, wake up for an hour, and go to bed.

689
00:43:01,923 --> 00:43:03,884
[SPEAKER_15]: Like, that was my week, pretty much.

690
00:43:03,945 --> 00:43:04,465
[SPEAKER_15]: It sucked.

691
00:43:05,126 --> 00:43:07,227
[SPEAKER_15]: And then I had this huge thing on my arm.

692
00:43:07,267 --> 00:43:15,835
[SPEAKER_15]: Like, I don't know if it's a zit or what, but I saw one of my exes on Thursday who I hadn't seen in quite a while.

693
00:43:16,796 --> 00:43:19,918
[SPEAKER_15]: And, of course, he's got one of those sarcastic kinds of humor.

694
00:43:20,519 --> 00:43:21,580
[SPEAKER_15]: And no, it is not AIDS.

695
00:43:23,530 --> 00:43:24,951
[SPEAKER_15]: He said it looks like I do drugs.

696
00:43:25,831 --> 00:43:26,631
[SPEAKER_19]: It totally does.

697
00:43:26,771 --> 00:43:29,292
[SPEAKER_15]: So now I'm kind of like, oh, cool, I can go around and show people at work.

698
00:43:29,472 --> 00:43:31,073
[SPEAKER_15]: Like, people at work probably think I do drugs.

699
00:43:31,093 --> 00:43:31,653
[SPEAKER_15]: That's pretty cool.

700
00:43:33,894 --> 00:43:36,995
[SPEAKER_10]: But then I show my mother, and she's like, you've got a burn!

701
00:43:37,075 --> 00:43:42,357
[SPEAKER_03]: It's an infected blood vessel, and you're going to die if you don't go to the doctor and get it taken care of.

702
00:43:43,318 --> 00:43:44,378
[SPEAKER_21]: Have you tried Lansing yet?

703
00:43:45,279 --> 00:43:46,859
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I can't, but it's going down.

704
00:43:46,939 --> 00:43:48,900
[SPEAKER_02]: So why make a big deal out of it if it's going down?

705
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:50,280
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, make sure that you take Benadryl.

706
00:43:51,121 --> 00:43:51,521
[SPEAKER_15]: Benadryl.

707
00:43:52,375 --> 00:43:53,956
[SPEAKER_21]: Take it before bed in case I'll knock your ass out.

708
00:43:55,677 --> 00:43:57,458
[SPEAKER_21]: That's what I've been living on is Benadryl at night.

709
00:43:57,858 --> 00:43:59,339
[SPEAKER_21]: That's my anti-drug.

710
00:43:59,519 --> 00:44:03,361
[SPEAKER_15]: My mother also told me something very scary yesterday that made me kind of want to hit her.

711
00:44:03,542 --> 00:44:03,782
[SPEAKER_21]: What?

712
00:44:04,202 --> 00:44:08,424
[SPEAKER_15]: She said, I'm so in love with Cher that I think I'm a lesbian.

713
00:44:08,785 --> 00:44:09,565
[SPEAKER_15]: And then she laughed.

714
00:44:13,127 --> 00:44:15,108
[SPEAKER_15]: And I was like, don't you ever say that again.

715
00:44:15,128 --> 00:44:16,189
[SPEAKER_21]: That's alarming.

716
00:44:16,609 --> 00:44:17,790
[SPEAKER_15]: That is very alarming.

717
00:44:22,588 --> 00:44:26,870
[SPEAKER_15]: I can't really, you know, I wouldn't say it's too much lesbianism there, because she is quite man-ish.

718
00:44:28,071 --> 00:44:28,731
[SPEAKER_15]: Cher, that is.

719
00:44:28,911 --> 00:44:31,132
[SPEAKER_21]: She sounds like a, she sings like a horse.

720
00:44:31,152 --> 00:44:33,974
[SPEAKER_15]: That was pretty much my response, but anyway.

721
00:44:35,494 --> 00:44:36,595
[SPEAKER_03]: She does sound like a horse.

722
00:44:37,655 --> 00:44:41,597
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, actually, for those of you who wonder, Cher was actually doing a concert in Sacramento last night.

723
00:44:41,677 --> 00:44:42,778
[SPEAKER_15]: It was her farewell tour.

724
00:44:43,158 --> 00:44:45,759
[SPEAKER_15]: Second time she's been here, by the way, on the farewell tour.

725
00:44:48,031 --> 00:44:51,495
[SPEAKER_15]: We went the first time, so we didn't see the need to go the second time.

726
00:44:51,515 --> 00:44:55,120
[SPEAKER_21]: I know why she's doing a farewell tour, because she's running out of things to do plastic surgery on.

727
00:44:55,601 --> 00:44:56,001
[SPEAKER_15]: Seriously.

728
00:44:56,181 --> 00:44:58,124
[SPEAKER_15]: But the second time...

729
00:44:59,479 --> 00:45:02,362
[SPEAKER_15]: I love Cher, I love her so much I watch the concert every time it comes on NBC

730
00:45:26,341 --> 00:45:27,122
[SPEAKER_21]: I did not do that.

731
00:45:27,242 --> 00:45:28,303
[SPEAKER_15]: I know.

732
00:45:29,724 --> 00:45:33,568
[SPEAKER_15]: So I decided to go out last night because I'm feeling better.

733
00:45:33,648 --> 00:45:34,869
[SPEAKER_15]: So I went out with my buddy Matt.

734
00:45:34,889 --> 00:45:37,712
[SPEAKER_15]: I was supposed to go to some barbecue with Irene and Brad, but they never called me, so...

735
00:45:39,565 --> 00:45:40,746
[SPEAKER_15]: I went out with Matt instead.

736
00:45:41,267 --> 00:45:45,110
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, we went to the Streets of London, which is a little pub downtown.

737
00:45:46,351 --> 00:45:54,878
[SPEAKER_15]: And we went to this place and I ate this huge plate of... Streets of London has the best fish and chips.

738
00:45:56,019 --> 00:45:56,800
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, I didn't have that.

739
00:45:56,820 --> 00:45:59,883
[SPEAKER_15]: I had a big plate of fries covered in cheese and bacon.

740
00:46:00,363 --> 00:46:01,084
[SPEAKER_15]: Mmm, fat.

741
00:46:01,124 --> 00:46:01,844
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, chips.

742
00:46:01,925 --> 00:46:02,305
[SPEAKER_15]: Sorry.

743
00:46:02,365 --> 00:46:03,766
[SPEAKER_15]: Chips, cheese, and bacon.

744
00:46:03,846 --> 00:46:04,527
[SPEAKER_15]: My bad.

745
00:46:06,366 --> 00:46:07,367
[SPEAKER_15]: Stupid British slang.

746
00:46:09,490 --> 00:46:11,292
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm just trying to see if I can get Ferb pissed off at me.

747
00:46:11,693 --> 00:46:24,247
[SPEAKER_15]: Anyway... So we went there, and I actually drank beer, but it was Guinness, so I'm forgiven.

748
00:46:24,267 --> 00:46:25,609
[SPEAKER_21]: If it was Guinness, it's beautiful.

749
00:46:27,197 --> 00:46:52,126
[SPEAKER_15]: and this is the drink of the gods after that we went over to the depot because it was kind of late we didn't really want to go like dancing dancing so we went over to the depot which is a gay bar in Sacramento me and my friend Matt the ice princess been on the show before we went over there and then we met like a whole bunch of other people there we met two people he knew from online and we met Phoenix also Corey you may or may not have met him I don't know if you have before or not

750
00:46:52,826 --> 00:46:56,229
[SPEAKER_15]: and then our other friend Joshy who's leaving town.

751
00:46:56,289 --> 00:46:57,089
[SPEAKER_15]: We just had a good old time.

752
00:46:57,149 --> 00:46:58,170
[SPEAKER_15]: We were partying it up.

753
00:46:58,190 --> 00:46:59,170
[SPEAKER_15]: And this is the funny thing.

754
00:47:00,171 --> 00:47:02,292
[SPEAKER_15]: It was the Cher concert after party.

755
00:47:04,614 --> 00:47:08,156
[SPEAKER_15]: So they started playing just like non-stop Cher stuff and we're like, okay, we have to go.

756
00:47:08,476 --> 00:47:10,578
[SPEAKER_15]: And we went to this new burger joint they opened up next door.

757
00:47:10,598 --> 00:47:11,919
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a brand new burger joint.

758
00:47:12,219 --> 00:47:14,580
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a gay burger joint in the gay district of Sacramento.

759
00:47:15,261 --> 00:47:16,361
[SPEAKER_15]: It's called Hot Rods.

760
00:47:21,169 --> 00:47:23,209
[SPEAKER_15]: I didn't get to play pinball at the depot last night, though.

761
00:47:23,229 --> 00:47:23,830
[SPEAKER_15]: That made me sad.

762
00:47:23,850 --> 00:47:25,350
[SPEAKER_15]: There was actually people on them, like, all night.

763
00:47:25,370 --> 00:47:26,310
[SPEAKER_15]: But they have pinball at the depot.

764
00:47:26,330 --> 00:47:28,311
[SPEAKER_21]: Was there good food, though, at the Hot Rods?

765
00:47:28,891 --> 00:47:32,291
[SPEAKER_15]: At Hot Rods, actually, the fries are damn good.

766
00:47:33,012 --> 00:47:34,892
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a lot like In-N-Out, the place.

767
00:47:35,092 --> 00:47:35,912
[SPEAKER_03]: Do they have wine beef?

768
00:47:36,132 --> 00:47:36,732
[SPEAKER_15]: But they have more.

769
00:47:36,972 --> 00:47:38,733
[SPEAKER_15]: They have garden burgers, if you want them.

770
00:47:38,813 --> 00:47:40,153
[SPEAKER_15]: They have turkey burgers, if you want them.

771
00:47:40,513 --> 00:47:44,114
[SPEAKER_15]: They have the hot dogs, if you're into that.

772
00:47:44,174 --> 00:47:45,574
[SPEAKER_15]: Chicken strips, whatever.

773
00:47:45,614 --> 00:47:46,735
[SPEAKER_15]: They have, like, way bigger menu.

774
00:47:46,755 --> 00:47:48,235
[SPEAKER_21]: Some people like hot dogs.

775
00:47:50,386 --> 00:47:51,927
[SPEAKER_15]: Some people like Polish dogs.

776
00:47:55,029 --> 00:47:56,971
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

777
00:47:56,991 --> 00:48:00,694
[SPEAKER_15]: That was... I'm not Chinese, so I don't eat dog.

778
00:48:02,055 --> 00:48:04,557
[SPEAKER_15]: What'd you say, Loki?

779
00:48:04,617 --> 00:48:09,982
[SPEAKER_15]: I said... Yeah, well, I'm not... Wait, no, I don't know if it's Chinese that eats... I can't remember.

780
00:48:10,542 --> 00:48:11,163
[SPEAKER_15]: Hello?

781
00:48:14,045 --> 00:48:15,566
[SPEAKER_21]: See, I can't reach the ferret.

782
00:48:16,067 --> 00:48:16,687
Come in!

783
00:48:17,368 --> 00:48:17,468
Oh!

784
00:48:19,665 --> 00:48:20,925
[SPEAKER_15]: Sharks Girl's here.

785
00:48:21,906 --> 00:48:22,866
[SPEAKER_15]: Not by choice.

786
00:48:24,646 --> 00:48:25,427
[SPEAKER_21]: Speak to our people.

787
00:48:25,467 --> 00:48:27,027
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, Sharks Girl, why don't you tell us.

788
00:48:27,067 --> 00:48:29,048
[SPEAKER_15]: We're all sitting around doing how was your week, how was your day.

789
00:48:29,068 --> 00:48:31,108
[SPEAKER_15]: Why don't you tell us how was your week and how was your day.

790
00:48:32,208 --> 00:48:34,349
[SPEAKER_18]: Week sucked.

791
00:48:34,849 --> 00:48:37,750
[SPEAKER_18]: Yesterday was good, today was good until about what, 6 p.m.?

792
00:48:38,350 --> 00:48:40,751
[SPEAKER_18]: Then it has sucked balls from there on out.

793
00:48:40,911 --> 00:48:43,932
[SPEAKER_18]: And I want to say for the record, Folsom sucks and has no cell phone reception.

794
00:48:44,872 --> 00:48:46,172
[SPEAKER_15]: I get cell phone reception in my house.

795
00:48:47,333 --> 00:48:48,333
[SPEAKER_18]: I've dropped like...

796
00:48:49,164 --> 00:48:51,425
[SPEAKER_18]: Four times since I got off the 50.

797
00:48:51,666 --> 00:48:51,866
[SPEAKER_15]: Ouch.

798
00:48:52,586 --> 00:48:52,906
[SPEAKER_15]: Sorry.

799
00:48:54,347 --> 00:48:54,647
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

800
00:48:55,708 --> 00:48:59,570
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, we're going to take a quick break and get back on track.

801
00:48:59,590 --> 00:49:01,652
[SPEAKER_15]: We have a lot of Imani news we want to talk about here.

802
00:49:02,372 --> 00:49:03,233
[SPEAKER_15]: Is there a track?

803
00:49:03,513 --> 00:49:04,073
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, there's a track.

804
00:49:04,093 --> 00:49:04,934
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a laugh track.

805
00:49:05,114 --> 00:49:05,954
[SPEAKER_15]: Not at Disneyland.

806
00:49:08,956 --> 00:49:09,316
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

807
00:49:09,416 --> 00:49:10,437
[SPEAKER_15]: Rob's going to hell.

808
00:49:14,019 --> 00:49:17,281
[SPEAKER_15]: We're going to kick off this break with a brand new Loki remix.

809
00:49:17,341 --> 00:49:18,802
[SPEAKER_15]: Loki, would you like to tell us about your mix?

810
00:49:19,386 --> 00:49:20,286
[SPEAKER_15]: I gotta change the name on it.

811
00:49:20,866 --> 00:49:21,947
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, he's gotta change the name on it.

812
00:49:21,987 --> 00:49:24,867
[SPEAKER_15]: But while you're changing the name, tell us something about the mix.

813
00:49:27,768 --> 00:49:30,269
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, it's cool and stuff.

814
00:49:30,669 --> 00:49:31,249
[SPEAKER_15]: No, I don't know.

815
00:49:31,369 --> 00:49:37,511
[SPEAKER_15]: It was just, um, I needed something to mix together and this just kind of worked for some reason.

816
00:49:37,811 --> 00:49:38,651
[SPEAKER_15]: So, yeah.

817
00:49:42,043 --> 00:49:46,485
[SPEAKER_15]: It's, um, Stoic, the Big Thunder Mountain Mix.

818
00:49:47,766 --> 00:49:50,127
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright, this is Loki's brand newest remix.

819
00:49:50,147 --> 00:49:52,088
[SPEAKER_15]: This is Stoic, the Big Thunder Mountain Mix.

820
00:49:52,108 --> 00:49:53,149
[SPEAKER_20]: The brandest new?

821
00:49:53,249 --> 00:49:54,229
[SPEAKER_15]: The brandest newest.

822
00:49:54,989 --> 00:49:56,990
[SPEAKER_15]: Not just brandest new, the brandest newest.

823
00:49:58,911 --> 00:50:01,973
[SPEAKER_15]: Here it is, Stoic, the Big Thunder Mountain Mix, here on Orange Lounge Radio.

824
00:52:17,884 --> 00:52:18,664
[SPEAKER_15]: Hey, I like that.

825
00:52:18,684 --> 00:52:19,465
[SPEAKER_15]: That was pretty cool.

826
00:52:19,525 --> 00:52:21,745
[SPEAKER_15]: That was Stoic, the Big Thunder Mountain mix.

827
00:52:21,765 --> 00:52:22,946
[SPEAKER_15]: That was kind of neat.

828
00:52:23,626 --> 00:52:25,567
[SPEAKER_15]: I have to agree with the chat room.

829
00:52:25,607 --> 00:52:27,047
[SPEAKER_15]: It kind of sounded a little bit like porn.

830
00:52:27,968 --> 00:52:29,828
[SPEAKER_15]: But it definitely choo-chooed along there.

831
00:52:31,609 --> 00:52:32,029
[SPEAKER_15]: I like that.

832
00:52:32,089 --> 00:52:33,570
[SPEAKER_15]: For once, he didn't use gravity.

833
00:52:33,670 --> 00:52:35,911
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's give him a hand for staying away from gravity.

834
00:52:39,032 --> 00:52:40,632
[SPEAKER_15]: Now you've got to do one that's not tack.

835
00:52:40,833 --> 00:52:41,793
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know if you can do it.

836
00:52:43,942 --> 00:52:46,303
[SPEAKER_15]: But I like the little bits-a-holic there at the end, too.

837
00:52:46,323 --> 00:52:46,983
[SPEAKER_15]: That was kind of cool.

838
00:52:47,704 --> 00:52:48,164
[SPEAKER_15]: That was nice.

839
00:52:48,624 --> 00:52:49,024
[SPEAKER_15]: I like that.

840
00:52:49,064 --> 00:52:50,305
[SPEAKER_15]: Good job.

841
00:52:50,405 --> 00:52:51,585
[SPEAKER_15]: Anybody want to say something about it?

842
00:52:54,406 --> 00:52:54,506
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh.

843
00:52:55,567 --> 00:53:00,609
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, I think we'll go back to break, because we've got other people doing other errands or whatever.

844
00:53:02,309 --> 00:53:07,251
[SPEAKER_15]: We're going to play some more songs, and we'll be back.

845
00:53:39,518 --> 00:53:40,559
Thank you for watching!

846
00:56:40,105 --> 00:56:41,110
Thanks for watching!

847
00:58:06,824 --> 00:58:08,185
Listen to Orange Lounge Radio.

848
00:58:08,205 --> 00:58:09,105
Because Bongo demands it.

849
00:58:28,154 --> 00:58:30,676
[SPEAKER_15]: Hello and welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio.

850
00:58:31,156 --> 00:58:36,441
[SPEAKER_15]: And Tomorrow Perfume we heard in that break, which is kind of part of the Bomani news we've been hearing about this week.

851
00:58:36,461 --> 00:58:37,802
[SPEAKER_19]: Is that a remedy to today's stink?

852
00:58:39,543 --> 00:58:46,409
[SPEAKER_15]: Or as our resident comedian, Lanky Style, says in the chat room, Have you heard the new DJ Taka song sampled for 2DX 10th Style?

853
00:58:46,709 --> 00:58:48,351
[SPEAKER_15]: It's called Yesterday Cologne.

854
00:58:50,652 --> 00:58:52,554
[SPEAKER_21]: I like today's stink.

855
00:58:53,355 --> 00:58:57,158
[SPEAKER_15]: That sounds like something I would have read on Moondabor's blog.

856
00:59:00,157 --> 00:59:03,220
[SPEAKER_15]: I like today's musk.

857
00:59:24,167 --> 00:59:25,869
[SPEAKER_15]: I guess something to do with the demo disc.

858
00:59:25,929 --> 00:59:29,113
[SPEAKER_15]: You hack the disc and you see a master list of songs.

859
00:59:29,173 --> 00:59:35,802
[SPEAKER_15]: And in that list of songs, we saw Tomorrow Perfume, which indicates Tomorrow Perfume will be an unlock in Max 2 USA.

860
00:59:36,863 --> 00:59:37,124
[SPEAKER_15]: Or not.

861
00:59:37,925 --> 00:59:38,205
Or not.

862
00:59:38,746 --> 00:59:38,986
[SPEAKER_15]: Or not.

863
00:59:40,189 --> 00:59:57,003
[SPEAKER_15]: It may be, because what happens is, and as this was explained by this guy on the boards called DancerX, he explained that with every new home release, there's an updated master list of every single song that's ever been in DDR, pretty much.

864
00:59:58,124 --> 01:00:01,406
[SPEAKER_15]: Or, so to say, everything that's pretty much in that...

865
01:00:02,527 --> 01:00:05,108
[SPEAKER_15]: version of the DDR engine or whatever.

866
01:00:05,188 --> 01:00:21,811
[SPEAKER_15]: So in this case, we're going to have, with this list, it's pretty much both what's going to be in Dancing Stage Fever and what's going to be in Max 2 USA, because they both use the same engine, so it's hard to determine what's going to be in what.

867
01:00:22,691 --> 01:00:29,413
[SPEAKER_15]: But that was one of the songs that was mentioned in there, along with More Deep from, I think, isn't that 2DX6 style or something like that?

868
01:00:30,945 --> 01:00:32,086
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, that's going to be in there.

869
01:00:33,446 --> 01:00:37,348
[SPEAKER_15]: But those are some of the ones that are supposed to be in there.

870
01:00:37,408 --> 01:00:46,892
[SPEAKER_15]: There's another one, one of the ones that kind of grabbed people's attention was, and it's a really odd name, it's called Max and then there's a period after it.

871
01:00:47,712 --> 01:00:51,654
[SPEAKER_15]: So I guess either it's just like Max or Max period.

872
01:00:53,695 --> 01:00:56,376
[SPEAKER_15]: Was Max Unlimited also in the list?

873
01:00:57,563 --> 01:00:58,724
[SPEAKER_15]: Legend of Max, Paranoia, Survivor Max

874
01:01:29,602 --> 01:01:36,888
[SPEAKER_15]: Now, because of this hacking of the disc, they've kind of had to go and reveal some things, some more things about DDR Max 2 USA.

875
01:01:37,328 --> 01:01:42,392
[SPEAKER_15]: And I've always kind of hated this, I know something you don't know business about Max 2.

876
01:01:42,472 --> 01:01:50,438
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, I understand the desire to create like, I don't know what you'd call it, like people wanted to drool.

877
01:01:50,498 --> 01:01:51,239
[SPEAKER_02]: Superiority?

878
01:01:51,299 --> 01:01:57,043
[SPEAKER_15]: Surprise, not superiority, just wanting to surprise people or whatever, wanting to tease things and stuff like that.

879
01:01:57,083 --> 01:01:57,404
[SPEAKER_15]: But you know,

880
01:01:58,527 --> 01:02:01,108
[SPEAKER_15]: The Guessing Games and all that garbage.

881
01:02:02,188 --> 01:02:04,349
[SPEAKER_15]: Sometimes it kind of makes me wish they'd stay out of it.

882
01:02:04,369 --> 01:02:04,969
[SPEAKER_15]: You know what I mean?

883
01:02:05,090 --> 01:02:06,310
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know.

884
01:02:06,370 --> 01:02:13,473
[SPEAKER_15]: I just don't like the whole fact that there's this whole I-know-something-you-don't-know attitude about a lot of this stuff.

885
01:02:13,513 --> 01:02:14,913
[SPEAKER_15]: And it just makes me bitter.

886
01:02:16,674 --> 01:02:18,675
[SPEAKER_15]: Anyway, here's what we do know.

887
01:02:18,755 --> 01:02:19,555
[SPEAKER_15]: Here's what we've been told.

888
01:02:20,322 --> 01:02:34,112
[SPEAKER_15]: When they hacked the disc, they tried to bring up the song samples, because if you remember when the Max 1 disc was hacked, they were able to get song samples, and that's how they found that there was a Drop the Bomb remix on there, is that somebody hacked out the sound sample from the demo disc.

889
01:02:34,858 --> 01:02:38,779
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, they got smarter this time, and none of those samples are in there.

890
01:02:39,079 --> 01:02:46,681
[SPEAKER_15]: It just had the four samples of the songs, but it had a Midnight Blaze remix in there, which has been revealed to be the information screen music.

891
01:02:46,921 --> 01:02:47,701
[SPEAKER_15]: Whoop-a-doo!

892
01:02:48,881 --> 01:02:54,482
[SPEAKER_15]: And, for those who don't know, it's probably the same damn remix that was on the V-Rare CD with Max, too.

893
01:02:55,342 --> 01:02:56,903
[SPEAKER_15]: Ooh, don't care.

894
01:02:57,443 --> 01:02:58,243
Whoop-a-doo!

895
01:03:01,964 --> 01:03:02,044
[SPEAKER_15]: Um...

896
01:03:04,133 --> 01:03:04,633
[SPEAKER_15]: Feelings Won't Fade

897
01:03:28,751 --> 01:03:36,616
[SPEAKER_15]: Max 2 US has a color-coded song system, meaning that kind of like how Max 2 Japan, you had all these different colors of songs in there.

898
01:03:36,996 --> 01:03:43,180
[SPEAKER_15]: You had, you know, the new songs were one color, the old songs were another color, the Oni remixes were another color.

899
01:03:43,200 --> 01:03:44,921
[SPEAKER_15]: They're going to do that as well with this.

900
01:03:45,581 --> 01:03:49,523
[SPEAKER_15]: And so default songs are green that are new to the US, 27 of them.

901
01:03:51,494 --> 01:04:19,830
[SPEAKER_15]: repeats US songs because there was a few of those in there I believe like Shining Polaris is coming back and there's a few others I think Silent Hills one repeats are blue there's 13 repeats unlocks are yellow and there's 20 unlocks pretty good amount challenge step unlocks are purple and there's 7 of them and the special red unlocks there's 2 of them which assumably have been maxed unlimited in Conklin yeah pretty much um

902
01:04:21,678 --> 01:04:29,463
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't believe that there's not the samples on the disc because they're lazy and stupid and they're going to leave crap like that.

903
01:04:29,483 --> 01:04:32,225
[SPEAKER_15]: They fuck up every single US mix ever made.

904
01:04:32,785 --> 01:04:37,528
[SPEAKER_15]: Every single one's been fucked up in some way and lazy in some way.

905
01:04:37,648 --> 01:04:42,251
[SPEAKER_15]: So I'm going to look myself on this disc to see if I can fight it.

906
01:04:42,311 --> 01:04:46,714
[SPEAKER_15]: Just because they might not have found it the conventional way doesn't mean it's not still there.

907
01:04:49,079 --> 01:04:52,000
[SPEAKER_15]: Burning Heat's been confirmed as an unlock.

908
01:04:54,240 --> 01:04:55,060
[SPEAKER_15]: What else did they confirm?

909
01:04:55,140 --> 01:04:57,561
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, yes, that Oni Mode is not in the game.

910
01:04:58,561 --> 01:04:59,822
[SPEAKER_15]: Oni Mode will not be in the game.

911
01:04:59,982 --> 01:05:00,962
[SPEAKER_15]: Nonstop, yes.

912
01:05:01,522 --> 01:05:02,562
[SPEAKER_15]: Oni Mode, no.

913
01:05:03,082 --> 01:05:03,923
[SPEAKER_19]: I prefer Nonstop.

914
01:05:03,983 --> 01:05:10,264
[SPEAKER_15]: And in its place, in Oni Mode's place, will be Challenge Mode.

915
01:05:10,444 --> 01:05:13,365
[SPEAKER_15]: Like the challenge on 4th Mix type stuff?

916
01:05:13,765 --> 01:05:14,365
[SPEAKER_15]: That's cool.

917
01:05:15,333 --> 01:05:16,874
[SPEAKER_15]: That's what I heard is going to be the difference.

918
01:05:16,894 --> 01:05:19,597
[SPEAKER_15]: They're going to have a challenge mode to unlock these things.

919
01:05:20,197 --> 01:05:24,921
[SPEAKER_15]: And I like that better, to be honest, because I think Onis are retarded.

920
01:05:25,622 --> 01:05:28,104
[SPEAKER_15]: But that's what they're going to be doing, I guess.

921
01:05:28,724 --> 01:05:31,907
[SPEAKER_15]: Here's why Onis are retarded, and I'm glad they're staying in the arcade.

922
01:05:32,247 --> 01:05:35,830
[SPEAKER_15]: Because playing on a homepad, you miss all the fucking time.

923
01:05:35,870 --> 01:05:37,211
[SPEAKER_15]: It's just part of playing at home.

924
01:05:37,271 --> 01:05:39,193
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't care if you have Ignition 59.0 or whatever...

925
01:05:40,974 --> 01:05:41,776
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

926
01:05:41,816 --> 01:05:42,658
[SPEAKER_15]: So non-stop was a better choice.

927
01:05:53,553 --> 01:05:57,935
[SPEAKER_15]: But it's just weird that they have, now that explains it, Loki, because I had a question.

928
01:05:58,315 --> 01:06:03,237
[SPEAKER_15]: How is it that they have the challenge step songs as unlocks when there's no Oni mode?

929
01:06:03,777 --> 01:06:05,938
[SPEAKER_15]: Or challenge mode, or whatever they're calling it in the U.S.

930
01:06:06,198 --> 01:06:11,081
[SPEAKER_15]: That makes sense to me, because I'm kind of like, wait a minute, so you're not going to have Oni mode, but you're going to have these Oni unlock songs.

931
01:06:11,321 --> 01:06:18,844
[SPEAKER_15]: And you're going to have, unless they go back and make basic trick-o-maniac steps, which I doubt they will, they're only going to have one set of steps.

932
01:06:21,676 --> 01:06:25,779
[SPEAKER_15]: Hopefully, I'll be pleasantly surprised if somebody's gone back and made basic and trick steps.

933
01:06:25,999 --> 01:06:30,962
[SPEAKER_15]: Because I think we all have accepted that the challenge steps will just be the maniac steps.

934
01:06:31,242 --> 01:06:32,322
[SPEAKER_15]: They can do it in five minutes.

935
01:06:32,543 --> 01:06:33,183
[SPEAKER_15]: Loki can do it.

936
01:06:33,243 --> 01:06:34,904
[SPEAKER_15]: Loki will come make steps for you.

937
01:06:36,525 --> 01:06:39,227
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, no, what's sad is they have steps for a few songs.

938
01:06:39,267 --> 01:06:43,669
[SPEAKER_15]: Like, for instance, Hysteria 2001 and Before You Before is a beat mix.

939
01:06:43,890 --> 01:06:44,950
[SPEAKER_15]: They're both in Euromix, too.

940
01:06:45,010 --> 01:06:47,812
[SPEAKER_15]: They have their own basic and trick steps for it.

941
01:06:48,416 --> 01:06:52,839
[SPEAKER_15]: They're just too lazy to put those over into the US mixes.

942
01:06:53,900 --> 01:06:54,340
[SPEAKER_15]: It's sad.

943
01:06:55,181 --> 01:06:55,641
[SPEAKER_15]: We think.

944
01:06:56,142 --> 01:06:56,782
[SPEAKER_15]: We speculate.

945
01:06:57,022 --> 01:06:57,543
[SPEAKER_15]: To this point.

946
01:06:58,123 --> 01:06:59,544
[SPEAKER_15]: We won't know for sure until September 24th.

947
01:06:59,644 --> 01:07:00,845
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm still not making a comment.

948
01:07:03,607 --> 01:07:10,392
[SPEAKER_21]: Um... I'm still going on record saying I'm supporting whatever Konami's gonna do.

949
01:07:11,753 --> 01:07:12,614
[SPEAKER_21]: Officially supporting.

950
01:07:13,234 --> 01:07:13,915
[SPEAKER_21]: I'll have the game.

951
01:07:15,893 --> 01:07:19,375
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't think there's any doubt that we're going to buy the game.

952
01:07:19,655 --> 01:07:23,556
[SPEAKER_15]: It'll be the best mix to date, home release to date.

953
01:07:23,616 --> 01:07:24,777
[SPEAKER_15]: There's no doubt about that.

954
01:07:25,337 --> 01:07:28,598
[SPEAKER_15]: So we all know that Max USA blew everything else out of the water.

955
01:07:28,638 --> 01:07:30,199
[SPEAKER_15]: It blew Max Japan out of the water.

956
01:07:30,339 --> 01:07:30,839
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm sorry.

957
01:07:30,899 --> 01:07:32,480
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't care what you think about the Japanese.

958
01:07:32,800 --> 01:07:35,481
[SPEAKER_15]: It was superior in every way to Max Japan.

959
01:07:36,341 --> 01:07:39,222
[SPEAKER_15]: And Max 2 USA will probably be superior in every way to Max Japan.

960
01:07:39,682 --> 01:07:44,404
[SPEAKER_15]: But as rabid fans, we're going to bitch about everything that wasn't done the way we wanted it to.

961
01:07:47,654 --> 01:07:55,416
[SPEAKER_15]: So, that being said, I believe that covers everything that's been confirmed this week for Max 2 USA.

962
01:07:55,776 --> 01:07:57,036
[SPEAKER_15]: Do we know any more of those songs?

963
01:07:57,076 --> 01:07:59,577
[SPEAKER_15]: I was trying to find that list of songs that were found in the hacks.

964
01:07:59,997 --> 01:08:04,218
[SPEAKER_15]: I know one that kind of struck me as interesting was Don't Call Me Baby by Madison Avenue.

965
01:08:04,498 --> 01:08:06,898
[SPEAKER_15]: Because I haven't seen that announced for either game yet.

966
01:08:07,018 --> 01:08:08,719
[SPEAKER_15]: So it's an unlock in one of the games.

967
01:08:09,259 --> 01:08:10,959
[SPEAKER_15]: More than likely probably the European one.

968
01:08:10,979 --> 01:08:13,640
[SPEAKER_15]: Because I don't think they have as much of the European list to do this one.

969
01:08:17,797 --> 01:08:22,142
[SPEAKER_15]: So, some of the other ones I think were in there.

970
01:08:22,162 --> 01:08:24,304
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm trying to look up the list here.

971
01:08:24,664 --> 01:08:27,087
[SPEAKER_15]: I think Turn the Beat Around was another one, maybe.

972
01:08:27,988 --> 01:08:29,710
[SPEAKER_15]: Or Saturday Night Fever or something like that.

973
01:08:29,790 --> 01:08:35,616
[SPEAKER_15]: There was one that was an old school song that I just can't remember which one it was.

974
01:08:35,896 --> 01:08:36,817
[SPEAKER_15]: There's a bunch of stuff on there.

975
01:08:36,837 --> 01:08:37,297
[SPEAKER_15]: There's another...

976
01:08:39,497 --> 01:08:41,438
[SPEAKER_15]: Another Spice Girls song in there, I think.

977
01:08:41,919 --> 01:08:42,439
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, goody.

978
01:08:43,099 --> 01:08:50,404
[SPEAKER_15]: But, you know, that's obviously going to be friggin' European, so... Yay, don't care.

979
01:08:53,386 --> 01:08:55,487
[SPEAKER_15]: Anyway, that's the big Monty News this week.

980
01:08:57,369 --> 01:08:57,609
[SPEAKER_15]: So...

981
01:08:58,784 --> 01:09:01,725
[SPEAKER_15]: I haven't really heard of anything else going on in the Bomani world this week.

982
01:09:01,785 --> 01:09:05,127
[SPEAKER_15]: Anybody know anything interesting going on otherwise?

983
01:09:05,667 --> 01:09:06,828
[SPEAKER_19]: Not that I've noticed.

984
01:09:07,448 --> 01:09:07,668
[SPEAKER_15]: What?

985
01:09:08,208 --> 01:09:09,549
[SPEAKER_21]: I haven't really noticed anything.

986
01:09:09,689 --> 01:09:12,550
[SPEAKER_21]: I think that the only activity is going on over here.

987
01:09:14,759 --> 01:09:16,260
[SPEAKER_15]: What, with Max 2 USA?

988
01:09:16,400 --> 01:09:18,342
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, I think that's really the only thing going on.

989
01:09:18,362 --> 01:09:23,106
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, we have Extreme in Japan coming out in October, but I think we all kind of know what to expect.

990
01:09:23,246 --> 01:09:28,171
[SPEAKER_15]: Because the Japanese ones, we always know what to expect because they're going to be just like the arcade ones, pretty much.

991
01:09:28,451 --> 01:09:31,614
[SPEAKER_15]: It's just the song list is always a question, and what's going to be an unlock, and...

992
01:09:32,446 --> 01:09:34,506
[SPEAKER_15]: Hopefully Extreme Japan doesn't suck.

993
01:09:35,086 --> 01:09:41,968
[SPEAKER_15]: There's a lot of people already kind of pushing it and selling it as it's going to be the best home release yet.

994
01:09:42,008 --> 01:09:43,808
[SPEAKER_15]: It's going to be even better than Max 2 USA.

995
01:09:44,208 --> 01:09:47,449
[SPEAKER_15]: Personally, I doubt it's going to be better than Max 2 USA.

996
01:09:47,469 --> 01:09:49,949
[SPEAKER_15]: Extreme just sucked for me.

997
01:09:50,169 --> 01:09:51,149
[SPEAKER_15]: Even the arcade version.

998
01:09:51,169 --> 01:09:56,870
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, sure it had an assload of songs, but not that many new, new, new, new songs.

999
01:09:56,950 --> 01:09:59,331
[SPEAKER_15]: Just a bunch of recycled shit from other games.

1000
01:09:59,491 --> 01:10:01,791
[SPEAKER_21]: I actually say that Extreme got me back into playing DDR.

1001
01:10:03,757 --> 01:10:05,419
[SPEAKER_15]: I think Extreme scared me away from DDR.

1002
01:10:07,140 --> 01:10:08,661
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm just, I'm not a big fan of Extreme.

1003
01:10:08,701 --> 01:10:19,531
[SPEAKER_15]: I think I'm, honestly, when it all said and done, I think I'm just really bitter at the fact that the Dance Mania tracks were, there was like, what, seven of them licensed and they weren't that great.

1004
01:10:19,571 --> 01:10:21,693
[SPEAKER_15]: There was maybe two good ones out of the whole bunch.

1005
01:10:22,213 --> 01:10:24,596
[SPEAKER_21]: And just... I like it for playing all the old stuff.

1006
01:10:25,176 --> 01:10:26,858
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, I don't know, it's just...

1007
01:10:27,486 --> 01:10:27,966
[SPEAKER_21]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1008
01:10:46,303 --> 01:11:11,948
[SPEAKER_15]: I play Stoic, that's kind of fun to dance to, it has interesting steps that are challenging Now what's weird is I actually have been getting back into DDR more lately I've been playing a little more DDR lately, but it's been any machine I can find really, it's not just extreme I played 4th Plus yesterday, I had a ball, until I almost killed myself Playing too many hard songs, that's what I get for being out of shape by the way

1009
01:11:13,030 --> 01:11:17,034
[SPEAKER_15]: I play a bunch of Catastrophics back to back and I almost have an asthma attack in the middle of the arcade.

1010
01:11:18,976 --> 01:11:21,358
[SPEAKER_15]: But I'll just have to practice more often.

1011
01:11:22,900 --> 01:11:24,581
[SPEAKER_15]: Here's some of the songs that were on there.

1012
01:11:26,183 --> 01:11:27,304
[SPEAKER_15]: Some of the new ones on the list.

1013
01:11:27,364 --> 01:11:32,049
[SPEAKER_15]: Come On Eileen, Groove Is In The Heart, Stayin' Alive, that was the one.

1014
01:11:32,734 --> 01:11:35,178
[SPEAKER_15]: I was thinking of staying alive, get down tonight.

1015
01:11:36,880 --> 01:11:38,262
[SPEAKER_15]: Then they have, of course, Take Me Away.

1016
01:11:38,282 --> 01:11:39,684
[SPEAKER_15]: That's one of the ones.

1017
01:11:40,305 --> 01:11:46,794
[SPEAKER_15]: A Stupid Barber, Teenage Kicks, Scorching Moon, A Little Bit of Ecstasy, All That She Wants.

1018
01:11:46,814 --> 01:11:47,795
[SPEAKER_15]: That's the end of the baseball.

1019
01:11:48,055 --> 01:12:04,540
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, Ace of Base, of course, Heaven, Cool for Cats, Jump Around, One Step Beyond, The Boys Are Back in Town, 2020 Vision, Dizzy, Virtuality, Music, the Bowstick Remix, which is by Darude, and then, of course, Busy Child and Feelings Won't Fade.

1020
01:12:04,580 --> 01:12:05,821
[SPEAKER_15]: Those are the new licensed songs.

1021
01:12:06,061 --> 01:12:12,583
[SPEAKER_15]: Bad Routine was another one that was in there, and More Deep version .21 or whatever.

1022
01:12:12,703 --> 01:12:15,824
[SPEAKER_21]: I want someone to do a Routine to Bad Routine.

1023
01:12:15,844 --> 01:12:15,984
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, yeah.

1024
01:12:17,390 --> 01:12:19,171
[SPEAKER_15]: and Keep On Lifting from last time.

1025
01:12:19,191 --> 01:12:20,472
[SPEAKER_15]: Remember how I said Keep On Lifting?

1026
01:12:20,492 --> 01:12:21,112
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, yeah.

1027
01:12:21,372 --> 01:12:22,553
[SPEAKER_15]: No Nemesis makes me sad.

1028
01:12:23,753 --> 01:12:24,594
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, no Nemesis.

1029
01:12:24,614 --> 01:12:25,294
[SPEAKER_15]: What happened there?

1030
01:12:26,255 --> 01:12:28,636
[SPEAKER_15]: Nemesis would be kind of... It's not a dance song.

1031
01:12:28,676 --> 01:12:29,136
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm sorry.

1032
01:12:29,596 --> 01:12:31,257
[SPEAKER_15]: Whoever cut that, it was a good idea.

1033
01:12:31,437 --> 01:12:32,678
[SPEAKER_15]: I hope they put something else in its place.

1034
01:12:36,260 --> 01:12:37,240
[SPEAKER_15]: Max, period.

1035
01:12:40,342 --> 01:12:40,702
[SPEAKER_15]: Who knows?

1036
01:12:42,423 --> 01:12:44,544
[SPEAKER_15]: I think it's just something to screw with people.

1037
01:12:46,107 --> 01:12:47,308
[SPEAKER_15]: I think it's just something to screw with people.

1038
01:12:47,328 --> 01:12:48,149
[SPEAKER_15]: Maybe it's just a placeholder.

1039
01:12:48,869 --> 01:12:51,912
[SPEAKER_15]: I think it's a... I don't think it means shit.

1040
01:12:52,592 --> 01:12:54,153
[SPEAKER_15]: Maybe it's something for challenge mode, who knows.

1041
01:12:55,895 --> 01:12:57,196
[SPEAKER_15]: But that would be cool if it wasn't.

1042
01:12:57,456 --> 01:12:57,936
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

1043
01:12:58,797 --> 01:12:59,558
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, it would be.

1044
01:13:04,645 --> 01:13:12,632
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, so 4th Plus Rules, and that's why I'm so excited that Konga Feelin' and Dream A Dream are going to be in with their respective music videos.

1045
01:13:12,952 --> 01:13:13,913
[SPEAKER_15]: That is so cool.

1046
01:13:14,173 --> 01:13:15,034
[SPEAKER_15]: That is so cool.

1047
01:13:15,374 --> 01:13:16,495
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm so excited about that.

1048
01:13:17,095 --> 01:13:21,399
[SPEAKER_15]: That's one thing that they're doing right, so right, that the Japanese mixes haven't been doing yet.

1049
01:13:22,500 --> 01:13:24,782
[SPEAKER_15]: But I'll tell you what, this new British mix is coming out.

1050
01:13:24,802 --> 01:13:25,382
[SPEAKER_15]: What's it called?

1051
01:13:25,422 --> 01:13:25,963
[SPEAKER_15]: The Dancing...

1052
01:13:26,781 --> 01:13:30,726
[SPEAKER_15]: Dancing Stage Fever, that sounds like the best DDR game yet.

1053
01:13:30,806 --> 01:13:34,751
[SPEAKER_15]: It's got like nothing but licensed songs from all these decades of music.

1054
01:13:34,991 --> 01:13:36,393
[SPEAKER_15]: It's got the fucking Spice Girls.

1055
01:13:36,654 --> 01:13:37,675
[SPEAKER_15]: That's rad.

1056
01:13:38,676 --> 01:13:42,721
[SPEAKER_15]: But the weirdest thing about it is that it's for the PS2 and PS1.

1057
01:13:44,432 --> 01:13:49,837
[SPEAKER_15]: That's just, I find that very strange, that they made a version for each system.

1058
01:13:50,918 --> 01:13:54,040
[SPEAKER_15]: So, do you think they'll run off different engines or something, or what do you think will happen?

1059
01:13:54,441 --> 01:13:57,183
[SPEAKER_15]: I bet you this, well, the CD one won't have the videos, obviously.

1060
01:13:57,483 --> 01:13:58,784
[SPEAKER_15]: It'll probably be a fifth mix.

1061
01:13:59,745 --> 01:14:00,085
[SPEAKER_15]: Pretty much.

1062
01:14:00,145 --> 01:14:06,671
[SPEAKER_15]: I think it's going to be a fifth mix engine, and then you're going to have the other one that's just, I don't know, probably just Max 2, obviously.

1063
01:14:07,211 --> 01:14:07,592
[SPEAKER_15]: But, um...

1064
01:14:08,372 --> 01:14:14,597
[SPEAKER_15]: Because it's a PS1 version, I can import that because I have a modded, you know, PlayStation stuff.

1065
01:14:15,678 --> 01:14:16,218
[SPEAKER_15]: That'd be cool.

1066
01:14:17,880 --> 01:14:18,600
[SPEAKER_15]: You're special.

1067
01:14:21,262 --> 01:14:21,602
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

1068
01:14:24,405 --> 01:14:26,086
[SPEAKER_15]: Why don't you tell us about what's going on in the sim?

1069
01:14:26,186 --> 01:14:27,327
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, well, no, let's take a break.

1070
01:14:28,308 --> 01:14:28,908
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's take a break.

1071
01:14:28,928 --> 01:14:31,130
[SPEAKER_15]: We're going to come back, and you want to do cage match next?

1072
01:14:31,470 --> 01:14:32,191
[SPEAKER_15]: Cage match works.

1073
01:14:33,171 --> 01:14:33,892
[SPEAKER_15]: Cage match works.

1074
01:14:33,912 --> 01:14:35,213
[SPEAKER_15]: We're going to do the cage match when we come back.

1075
01:14:35,553 --> 01:14:37,835
[SPEAKER_15]: If you want to participate in the... Yes, Loki.

1076
01:14:39,191 --> 01:14:42,513
[SPEAKER_15]: Don't Call Me Baby wasn't on the Dancing Stage Fever mix.

1077
01:14:42,833 --> 01:14:46,475
[SPEAKER_15]: No, actually, Madison Avenue, I can't remember if they're a European group or not.

1078
01:14:47,736 --> 01:14:48,116
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know.

1079
01:14:49,557 --> 01:14:52,319
[SPEAKER_15]: That song was huge here in clubs, and it still is.

1080
01:14:52,339 --> 01:14:54,300
[SPEAKER_15]: They play it every week at the club I go to.

1081
01:14:54,380 --> 01:14:56,481
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, it's still a huge dance song here.

1082
01:14:58,531 --> 01:15:03,533
[SPEAKER_15]: I guess the question would be, somebody's got to determine where they're really licensing these songs from.

1083
01:15:03,573 --> 01:15:06,294
[SPEAKER_15]: And you could probably figure it out with the record companies involved and everything.

1084
01:15:06,354 --> 01:15:11,416
[SPEAKER_15]: Like, what, Euromix 2 had stuff licensed from Zamba, right?

1085
01:15:12,416 --> 01:15:17,878
[SPEAKER_15]: But it was never really said where the licenses from the last Max USA was coming from.

1086
01:15:19,139 --> 01:15:24,160
[SPEAKER_15]: SyFam, but Sandstorm's not a SyFam song, so there's somebody else involved too.

1087
01:15:24,580 --> 01:15:24,981
[SPEAKER_15]: So who knows?

1088
01:15:25,541 --> 01:15:25,801
[SPEAKER_15]: Who knows?

1089
01:15:28,362 --> 01:15:31,344
[SPEAKER_20]: Please put my song in DDR!

1090
01:15:31,964 --> 01:15:33,645
[SPEAKER_20]: I need exposure!

1091
01:15:34,225 --> 01:15:34,725
[SPEAKER_20]: Maybe that.

1092
01:15:35,406 --> 01:15:40,788
[SPEAKER_15]: Maybe, in the case of Steve Reiner, but hey, Dark Black Forest, I know a lot of people think it's played out.

1093
01:15:40,809 --> 01:15:41,789
[SPEAKER_15]: It's the most annoying song ever.

1094
01:15:41,809 --> 01:15:43,510
[SPEAKER_15]: Whatever, I totally disagree.

1095
01:15:43,530 --> 01:15:47,072
[SPEAKER_15]: I think it was the best licensed song they had in Max USA, and I think it's awesome.

1096
01:15:47,092 --> 01:15:48,092
[SPEAKER_21]: I did like Sandstorm better.

1097
01:15:48,112 --> 01:15:52,395
[SPEAKER_15]: If I had to admit, their cover for Dancing Sage Fever is pretty gay.

1098
01:15:54,276 --> 01:15:55,076
[SPEAKER_15]: It's really retarded.

1099
01:15:57,540 --> 01:15:58,922
[SPEAKER_15]: I want to set that girl on fire.

1100
01:16:00,123 --> 01:16:01,044
[SPEAKER_15]: Anyway, we'll be back.

1101
01:16:01,765 --> 01:16:05,069
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think I played this song last week, but I don't care because the song rules.

1102
01:16:05,590 --> 01:16:10,295
[SPEAKER_15]: And Jamie wanted to hear more DDR songs tonight, so I'm going to play a DDR song I want to hear.

1103
01:16:10,556 --> 01:16:12,618
[SPEAKER_15]: And it's going to be a Max 2 USA, and that is good.

1104
01:16:12,958 --> 01:16:13,039
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay.

1105
01:16:13,059 --> 01:16:13,239
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay.

1106
01:16:50,530 --> 01:16:51,911
Thank you for watching!

1107
01:17:45,124 --> 01:17:56,012
[SPEAKER_11]: Clever, Clever Motemashite no Frustration You got an easy day, you got an easy day Sou no Rikou ni Shizuka ni Nemute no Masu ni

1108
01:18:17,757 --> 01:18:19,198
Thank you for watching!

1109
01:18:45,959 --> 01:18:46,900
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for watching!

1110
01:21:09,091 --> 01:21:14,955
[SPEAKER_05]: Please listen to Orange Lounge Radio, because real radio makes Captain Jack cry.

1111
01:21:20,519 --> 01:21:23,662
[SPEAKER_15]: Hello everybody and welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio episode .59.

1112
01:21:27,686 --> 01:21:28,327
[SPEAKER_15]: Uh, we're back.

1113
01:21:28,567 --> 01:21:29,007
[SPEAKER_19]: Ha ha.

1114
01:21:29,388 --> 01:21:33,290
[SPEAKER_15]: Ha ha, after some discussion on Max 2 USA and how was your week, how was your day?

1115
01:21:33,711 --> 01:21:36,633
[SPEAKER_15]: Shark Skrull's been gone for what, about 30 minutes now, I'd say?

1116
01:21:37,013 --> 01:21:37,654
[SPEAKER_15]: Not that long.

1117
01:21:37,674 --> 01:21:38,274
[SPEAKER_15]: Not that long?

1118
01:21:39,115 --> 01:21:41,857
[SPEAKER_15]: Where in the world is Melody?

1119
01:21:42,998 --> 01:21:44,039
[SPEAKER_21]: At my house, probably.

1120
01:21:44,599 --> 01:21:45,940
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm not funny at all today.

1121
01:21:45,960 --> 01:21:46,500
[SPEAKER_15]: You are anti-funny.

1122
01:21:46,560 --> 01:21:47,461
[SPEAKER_15]: I understand that.

1123
01:21:47,981 --> 01:21:49,543
[SPEAKER_21]: And our anti-funny is Rob.

1124
01:21:50,083 --> 01:21:50,704
Ha ha ha.

1125
01:21:51,704 --> 01:21:52,125
Ha ha ha.

1126
01:21:55,214 --> 01:21:56,555
[SPEAKER_15]: My anti-fun is Rob.

1127
01:21:56,636 --> 01:21:59,138
[SPEAKER_15]: Anyway, Loki, how about a sim update, sir?

1128
01:22:02,161 --> 01:22:03,562
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, you want me to do stuff, okay.

1129
01:22:06,084 --> 01:22:14,552
[SPEAKER_15]: But anyways, let's see, Stepmania came out with Beta 4, Alpha 4, I don't know what the fuck they're on now.

1130
01:22:16,127 --> 01:22:19,568
[SPEAKER_15]: I think it's like Alpha 4 Beta something.

1131
01:22:20,348 --> 01:22:21,729
[SPEAKER_15]: What are we on?

1132
01:22:21,929 --> 01:22:23,109
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, let's see.

1133
01:22:23,549 --> 01:22:27,130
[SPEAKER_15]: We're on Step Mania 3.9 Alpha 4B.

1134
01:22:27,930 --> 01:22:28,771
[SPEAKER_15]: Whatever the hell that means.

1135
01:22:29,311 --> 01:22:32,212
[SPEAKER_15]: But anyways, yeah, so they have more stuff fixed.

1136
01:22:32,252 --> 01:22:34,012
[SPEAKER_15]: Getting close to Step Mania 4, yippee.

1137
01:22:34,632 --> 01:22:36,853
[SPEAKER_15]: And then, what else?

1138
01:22:37,313 --> 01:22:40,054
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh yeah, DWI, I'm sure they did something.

1139
01:22:40,174 --> 01:22:40,614
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's see.

1140
01:22:42,007 --> 01:22:44,428
[SPEAKER_15]: Uh, DWI is just down this stupid 2.5.

1141
01:22:45,109 --> 01:22:45,569
[SPEAKER_15]: They suck.

1142
01:22:46,469 --> 01:22:52,532
[SPEAKER_15]: And, um, other than that, not real much going on other than, you know, tons of sim files coming out.

1143
01:22:52,953 --> 01:22:57,775
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, Shuey released another part of the DDR sim file history collection.

1144
01:22:58,355 --> 01:23:00,817
[SPEAKER_15]: More files from sites you've never heard of.

1145
01:23:01,157 --> 01:23:04,999
[SPEAKER_15]: And, um, other than that, like I said, not too much.

1146
01:23:05,879 --> 01:23:05,999
[SPEAKER_15]: Um...

1147
01:23:07,700 --> 01:23:10,684
[SPEAKER_15]: Pretty much if you're looking for sim files, there are a couple places you can go.

1148
01:23:10,784 --> 01:23:18,072
[SPEAKER_15]: Go to DDR Maniacs and check out, in their community news section, there's something about the sim file DC hub.

1149
01:23:18,352 --> 01:23:20,014
[SPEAKER_15]: That's the direct connect hub.

1150
01:23:20,054 --> 01:23:20,615
[SPEAKER_15]: You'll find...

1151
01:23:21,348 --> 01:23:25,952
[SPEAKER_15]: A bunch of people in there with thousands of files they can go leech off of.

1152
01:23:26,012 --> 01:23:31,636
[SPEAKER_15]: Also, there's going to be, you know, Bumai style, which you can find a bunch of cool stuff there.

1153
01:23:32,317 --> 01:23:40,764
[SPEAKER_15]: And then you can also get off your ass and go do some searches on the internet and find your damn files yourself, you lazy bastard.

1154
01:23:42,896 --> 01:24:04,820
[SPEAKER_15]: So, ha, I have to laugh about, oh yeah, there's some thing going on with DDR Freak about getting official sim file collections because, you know, no one has them anymore except for me and, you know, they can go fuck themselves because, not DDR Freak, but the project, the project that just happens to be on DDR Freak because, you know, I'm not sharing.

1155
01:24:06,656 --> 01:24:07,957
[SPEAKER_15]: So, what have we established?

1156
01:24:08,237 --> 01:24:09,337
[SPEAKER_15]: A, you're a pirate.

1157
01:24:09,737 --> 01:24:11,598
[SPEAKER_15]: R, and B, you're a selfish pirate.

1158
01:24:12,098 --> 01:24:12,819
[SPEAKER_15]: R, walk me plank.

1159
01:24:13,299 --> 01:24:15,179
[SPEAKER_21]: You butthead, you need to be kicked.

1160
01:24:16,200 --> 01:24:16,420
[SPEAKER_15]: Why?

1161
01:24:16,440 --> 01:24:18,341
[SPEAKER_21]: Someone never spanked you when you were little.

1162
01:24:20,001 --> 01:24:26,064
[SPEAKER_15]: No, but I think you know who's taking care of that now that Loki's in his 20s and all.

1163
01:24:27,344 --> 01:24:28,485
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't get spanked from her.

1164
01:24:29,765 --> 01:24:32,006
[SPEAKER_15]: Not from her, but, you know, your girlfriend.

1165
01:24:32,026 --> 01:24:34,127
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't get spanked from her.

1166
01:24:34,667 --> 01:24:34,947
[SPEAKER_15]: Never?

1167
01:24:34,967 --> 01:24:35,067
[SPEAKER_15]: Never.

1168
01:24:35,888 --> 01:24:36,208
[SPEAKER_15]: Never.

1169
01:24:37,079 --> 01:24:37,639
[SPEAKER_15]: You guys are boring.

1170
01:24:37,659 --> 01:24:38,800
[SPEAKER_21]: I see Dan all the time.

1171
01:24:39,120 --> 01:24:42,222
[SPEAKER_15]: Hello, TMI, TMI alert, thank you.

1172
01:24:42,302 --> 01:24:46,204
[SPEAKER_21]: No, I mean like literally like kick his butt a few times.

1173
01:24:47,164 --> 01:24:49,025
[SPEAKER_15]: Uh-huh, uh-huh, nice recovery, yeah.

1174
01:24:49,125 --> 01:24:50,526
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, he's into the rough stuff.

1175
01:24:51,787 --> 01:24:54,508
[SPEAKER_21]: You know, men need women to keep them in line.

1176
01:24:58,770 --> 01:25:01,672
[SPEAKER_21]: If not for us, you guys would just fuck this planet up.

1177
01:25:03,126 --> 01:25:03,606
[SPEAKER_15]: Sure.

1178
01:25:04,607 --> 01:25:12,370
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, because all those crazy women drivers out there causing accidents, tying up our freaking highways and byways.

1179
01:25:13,411 --> 01:25:13,631
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

1180
01:25:17,633 --> 01:25:18,613
[SPEAKER_15]: Just give me an evil look.

1181
01:25:19,294 --> 01:25:22,195
[SPEAKER_21]: You are so dead when I'm over my sick.

1182
01:25:24,599 --> 01:25:25,059
[SPEAKER_21]: You know what?

1183
01:25:25,319 --> 01:25:25,920
[SPEAKER_15]: You can't hurt me.

1184
01:25:25,940 --> 01:25:27,861
[SPEAKER_15]: I have the power of plane crashing.

1185
01:25:27,921 --> 01:25:31,062
[SPEAKER_15]: You're going to catch multiple infection disease from her if you're not careful.

1186
01:25:32,003 --> 01:25:32,503
[SPEAKER_15]: You know what?

1187
01:25:32,623 --> 01:25:33,364
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm immune.

1188
01:25:33,424 --> 01:25:35,004
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh my god, Jamie has to SARS.

1189
01:25:35,284 --> 01:25:36,265
[SPEAKER_17]: I do not have SARS.

1190
01:25:36,365 --> 01:25:37,065
[SPEAKER_17]: It's monkeypox.

1191
01:25:37,826 --> 01:25:38,486
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm immune.

1192
01:25:38,786 --> 01:25:39,327
Oh my god.

1193
01:25:39,587 --> 01:25:41,047
[SPEAKER_15]: I heard that SARS was coming back.

1194
01:25:41,087 --> 01:25:42,208
[SPEAKER_15]: Like, it was a big thing on Yahoo.

1195
01:25:42,448 --> 01:25:46,550
[SPEAKER_15]: Hey, you know, it's like, it's like, it's like Leif Garrett, okay?

1196
01:25:46,590 --> 01:25:48,511
[SPEAKER_15]: All of a sudden, SARS making a comeback, right?

1197
01:25:49,132 --> 01:25:51,173
[SPEAKER_15]: And what if you have SARS, Jamie?

1198
01:25:51,193 --> 01:25:52,553
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have SARS.

1199
01:25:52,914 --> 01:25:53,494
[SPEAKER_15]: How do you know?

1200
01:25:54,582 --> 01:25:55,983
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never been to China!

1201
01:25:56,483 --> 01:25:59,024
[SPEAKER_15]: Have you been in contact with any Canadians lately?

1202
01:26:00,845 --> 01:26:02,286
[SPEAKER_15]: Namely in the Toronto area?

1203
01:26:03,187 --> 01:26:05,068
[SPEAKER_15]: Is Marin Chan the Secret League Canadian?

1204
01:26:06,268 --> 01:26:08,730
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh my god, my spinners are coming from Toronto.

1205
01:26:08,930 --> 01:26:10,270
[SPEAKER_15]: They're probably laced with SARS.

1206
01:26:10,290 --> 01:26:12,392
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh my god, they're SARS-infested spinners.

1207
01:26:12,932 --> 01:26:13,872
[SPEAKER_21]: You can shut up.

1208
01:26:16,794 --> 01:26:20,476
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, before we get killed, I think now's a good time to get into the Orange Lounge Radio.

1209
01:26:21,346 --> 01:26:22,006
[SPEAKER_15]: Cage Match.

1210
01:26:22,307 --> 01:26:23,948
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm ready for the fuck you's of the week.

1211
01:26:26,529 --> 01:26:28,830
[SPEAKER_15]: Fuck you's of the week right after the Cage Match, I promise.

1212
01:26:30,191 --> 01:26:38,096
[SPEAKER_15]: Last week in the Orange Challenge Radio Cage Match, Loki won when he brought to the table his pick from Cybertrans Presents ELT.

1213
01:26:38,536 --> 01:26:41,337
[SPEAKER_15]: And Cybertrans, by the way, they're the folks that put together the...

1214
01:26:43,343 --> 01:26:47,244
[SPEAKER_15]: Ayumi Trance, thank you, Ayumi Hamasaki Trance, which 23rd Magus swears you can buy at Dimple.

1215
01:26:47,524 --> 01:26:49,785
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm going to get killed.

1216
01:26:51,246 --> 01:26:55,347
[SPEAKER_15]: Anyway, the song, the particular song from that CD is called Face the Change.

1217
01:26:56,747 --> 01:27:01,669
[SPEAKER_15]: It's remixed by Dirt Devils and Above and Beyond.

1218
01:27:02,518 --> 01:27:03,840
[SPEAKER_15]: And above and beyond, very cool.

1219
01:27:03,900 --> 01:27:05,583
[SPEAKER_15]: They do a lot of great remixes.

1220
01:27:05,844 --> 01:27:13,636
[SPEAKER_15]: They did Madonna's What It Feels Like For A Girl video remix, and they also did M, Ayumi Hamasaki's M, which is a great sim file.

1221
01:27:13,837 --> 01:27:14,558
[SPEAKER_10]: I like this song.

1222
01:27:15,891 --> 01:27:44,044

[SPEAKER_15]: Oops, dead air, sorry.

1228
01:29:44,536 --> 01:29:46,137
Dead air.

1229
01:29:46,197 --> 01:29:46,618
[SPEAKER_15]: My bad.

1230
01:29:48,239 --> 01:29:50,100
[SPEAKER_12]: You want to take the next song, Jamie, or you want me to?

1231
01:29:50,880 --> 01:29:51,401
Why not?

1232
01:29:51,801 --> 01:29:52,361
[SPEAKER_12]: You're going to do it?

1233
01:29:52,542 --> 01:29:53,102
Yeah, why not?

1234
01:29:53,482 --> 01:29:54,263
[SPEAKER_12]: Are you okay?

1235
01:29:54,283 --> 01:29:55,063
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm having a nap.

1236
01:29:55,223 --> 01:29:56,244
[SPEAKER_15]: You sound sleepy.

1237
01:29:56,264 --> 01:29:57,365
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm taking a nap.

1238
01:29:57,845 --> 01:30:01,168
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, well, before you nap, tell us about your song pick for this week.

1239
01:30:01,308 --> 01:30:03,529
[SPEAKER_19]: It's a remix of Tori Amos' Sugar.

1240
01:30:04,190 --> 01:30:05,891
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm so proud of Jamie.

1241
01:30:05,911 --> 01:30:07,212
[SPEAKER_15]: She picked Tori Amos this week.

1242
01:30:08,072 --> 01:30:10,414
[SPEAKER_19]: It's a good song, and it sounds all dark and depressed.

1243
01:30:11,420 --> 01:30:15,662
[SPEAKER_15]: So, this is a dark and depressing trance remix of Tori Amos with Sugar.

1244
01:30:15,702 --> 01:30:17,463
[SPEAKER_15]: This is song number two you can vote for tonight.

1245
01:30:18,444 --> 01:30:19,404
[SPEAKER_15]: DarkSakura's pick.

1246
01:30:19,444 --> 01:30:20,465
[SPEAKER_15]: Here it is, the whole song.

1247
01:30:32,951 --> 01:30:37,954
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura's Pick

1248
01:30:40,541 --> 01:30:46,924
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't say my name is gone, don't say that to me Like a day when I thought you were gone, I had to let you go

1249
01:32:42,644 --> 01:32:43,427
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for watching!

1250
01:33:38,542 --> 01:33:39,103
I wish you love

1251
01:34:29,461 --> 01:34:30,481
Thank you for watching!

1252
01:34:57,836 --> 01:35:00,857
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, that was Tori Amos with Sugar, the trance remix.

1253
01:35:01,277 --> 01:35:05,157
[SPEAKER_15]: And this is where we go around the room and everybody tells what they think about it and rate it.

1254
01:35:05,177 --> 01:35:05,957
[SPEAKER_19]: Tori, you do no wrong.

1255
01:35:06,758 --> 01:35:09,138
[SPEAKER_19]: And it's trancy, and it fit my mood today, so a ten.

1256
01:35:09,518 --> 01:35:10,118
[SPEAKER_15]: A ten from Jamie.

1257
01:35:10,158 --> 01:35:10,738
[SPEAKER_15]: Is the mic on?

1258
01:35:12,459 --> 01:35:12,839
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

1259
01:35:13,039 --> 01:35:16,259
[SPEAKER_15]: Sorry, I couldn't hear you through the monitors for some reason.

1260
01:35:16,339 --> 01:35:17,499
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, I hear it now.

1261
01:35:17,800 --> 01:35:18,140
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

1262
01:35:18,260 --> 01:35:19,180
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know, that was weird.

1263
01:35:19,200 --> 01:35:20,940
[SPEAKER_15]: Sorry, I'm having a SARS moment.

1264
01:35:21,820 --> 01:35:25,281
[SPEAKER_15]: So a ten from Jamie, no surprise.

1265
01:35:26,081 --> 01:35:26,281
[SPEAKER_15]: Loki.

1266
01:35:28,456 --> 01:35:29,076
[SPEAKER_15]: It was alright.

1267
01:35:29,277 --> 01:35:30,477
[SPEAKER_15]: It was mellow.

1268
01:35:31,838 --> 01:35:32,198
[SPEAKER_15]: I give it a 7.

1269
01:35:36,080 --> 01:35:36,400
[SPEAKER_15]: I agree.

1270
01:35:36,440 --> 01:35:37,341
[SPEAKER_15]: Troy can do no wrong.

1271
01:35:39,562 --> 01:35:41,243
[SPEAKER_15]: It sounds like a fan remix to me.

1272
01:35:41,803 --> 01:35:42,183
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know.

1273
01:35:42,203 --> 01:35:46,306
[SPEAKER_15]: It sounds a little... Unpolished?

1274
01:35:46,366 --> 01:35:47,066
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, unpolished.

1275
01:35:47,086 --> 01:35:47,746
[SPEAKER_15]: That's what I'm looking for.

1276
01:35:47,766 --> 01:35:48,027
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1277
01:35:48,047 --> 01:35:50,708
[SPEAKER_15]: A little grainy was the thing I was going to look for.

1278
01:35:50,748 --> 01:35:52,289
[SPEAKER_15]: But it's pretty damn well done.

1279
01:35:53,009 --> 01:35:56,331
[SPEAKER_15]: I can't see myself giving it a 10 for some reason, but a 9.

1280
01:35:56,391 --> 01:35:57,092
[SPEAKER_15]: 9.5 even.

1281
01:35:59,291 --> 01:36:00,092
[SPEAKER_15]: I do really like that.

1282
01:36:00,213 --> 01:36:00,833
[SPEAKER_15]: That was very good.

1283
01:36:01,114 --> 01:36:02,115
[SPEAKER_15]: And Tori is the shit.

1284
01:36:03,537 --> 01:36:07,341
[SPEAKER_15]: I would be a horrible gay man if I were to give Tori a low score.

1285
01:36:08,142 --> 01:36:08,523
[SPEAKER_15]: Anyway.

1286
01:36:09,506 --> 01:36:10,687
[SPEAKER_21]: I hope that the mix fits the song.

1287
01:36:11,068 --> 01:36:11,508
[SPEAKER_15]: It does.

1288
01:36:11,588 --> 01:36:12,629
[SPEAKER_15]: It does really fit the song.

1289
01:36:13,029 --> 01:36:14,451
[SPEAKER_15]: Have you heard the original of that song?

1290
01:36:14,951 --> 01:36:15,952
[SPEAKER_19]: Not in a very long time.

1291
01:36:16,412 --> 01:36:18,675
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, the remix fits it very well.

1292
01:36:18,755 --> 01:36:20,856
[SPEAKER_15]: So whoever remixed that did a damn good job.

1293
01:36:21,617 --> 01:36:22,798
[SPEAKER_15]: I would not be sad if that won at all.

1294
01:36:23,018 --> 01:36:24,820
[SPEAKER_15]: I actually like all of tonight's cage match songs.

1295
01:36:25,200 --> 01:36:26,942
[SPEAKER_15]: Usually there's one I'm kind of like, eh, I hope it doesn't win.

1296
01:36:27,342 --> 01:36:28,423
[SPEAKER_15]: Tonight, I don't care what wins.

1297
01:36:28,443 --> 01:36:28,864
[SPEAKER_15]: They're all good.

1298
01:36:30,288 --> 01:36:31,970
[SPEAKER_15]: So, my pick, song number three.

1299
01:36:32,030 --> 01:36:33,812
[SPEAKER_15]: Now, I knew that Loki won last week.

1300
01:36:33,832 --> 01:36:34,733
[SPEAKER_15]: He had a trance song.

1301
01:36:34,853 --> 01:36:36,635
[SPEAKER_15]: I knew Jamie was bringing a trance mix.

1302
01:36:37,075 --> 01:36:44,763
[SPEAKER_15]: So, usually, when, you know, I know of trance, that there's going to be two trance songs, and I try to do something different, like crazy.

1303
01:36:45,103 --> 01:36:47,186
[SPEAKER_15]: Like, I'll do something really, like, stupid crazy.

1304
01:36:48,267 --> 01:36:51,150
[SPEAKER_15]: And usually that ends up being a Kylie Minogue song of some sort.

1305
01:36:52,665 --> 01:36:55,105
[SPEAKER_15]: But tonight I thought, you know what, I don't really want to play Kylie Minogue.

1306
01:36:55,225 --> 01:36:57,486
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, how dare you put Kylie against, you know, Tori.

1307
01:36:58,166 --> 01:36:59,626
[SPEAKER_21]: Tori would up and kick her ass.

1308
01:36:59,766 --> 01:37:02,387
[SPEAKER_15]: No, so I thought, I'm not going to put in Kylie Minogue.

1309
01:37:02,467 --> 01:37:05,447
[SPEAKER_15]: Instead, I'm going to put in her sister, Dani Minogue.

1310
01:37:06,367 --> 01:37:06,687
What?

1311
01:37:06,707 --> 01:37:10,448
[SPEAKER_15]: Because Dani Minogue is starting a singing career, so I'm going to put in a song by her.

1312
01:37:11,448 --> 01:37:16,269
[SPEAKER_15]: This is Dani Minogue with Put the Needle on It, the Jason Nevins Ultra Pop Radio Edit.

1313
01:37:16,289 --> 01:37:20,110
[SPEAKER_15]: And I heard this last night at the club and I liked it a lot, so it's my entry for tonight's cage match.

1314
01:37:20,450 --> 01:37:21,110
[SPEAKER_15]: Here it is, enjoy.

1315
01:37:46,962 --> 01:37:47,963
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for watching!

1316
01:38:32,221 --> 01:38:32,982
Thanks for watching!

1317
01:40:05,206 --> 01:40:06,289
Thank you for watching!

1318
01:40:45,189 --> 01:40:45,750
Thank you for watching!

1319
01:41:17,970 --> 01:41:23,118
[SPEAKER_15]: Alrightio, song number three, Danny Minow, Put the Needle on It, Jason Evans mix.

1320
01:41:23,299 --> 01:41:23,559
[SPEAKER_15]: Jamie?

1321
01:41:23,860 --> 01:41:25,763
[SPEAKER_21]: I guess what's good for Kylie is good for Danny.

1322
01:41:26,444 --> 01:41:27,445
[SPEAKER_21]: Break out the cookie cutter.

1323
01:41:28,767 --> 01:41:29,909
[SPEAKER_21]: It wasn't bad, so you get the six.

1324
01:41:30,626 --> 01:41:31,606
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, Loki.

1325
01:41:33,967 --> 01:41:34,947
[SPEAKER_15]: I like to give it an 8.

1326
01:41:37,087 --> 01:41:40,608
[SPEAKER_15]: You actually told me to play... I played like four of them for you and you said that was the best one.

1327
01:41:40,648 --> 01:41:41,028
[SPEAKER_15]: I agree.

1328
01:41:41,328 --> 01:41:41,828
[SPEAKER_15]: I like that one.

1329
01:41:41,968 --> 01:41:43,208
[SPEAKER_15]: In my opinion, that's the best one.

1330
01:41:43,248 --> 01:41:44,228
[SPEAKER_15]: The remix is awesome.

1331
01:41:44,608 --> 01:41:45,649
[SPEAKER_15]: It's porno.

1332
01:41:45,929 --> 01:41:50,810
[SPEAKER_15]: It makes me want to do lap dances in Pixie Dust's lap and tug on her Kylie underwear.

1333
01:41:52,850 --> 01:41:53,890
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm going to get killed for that.

1334
01:41:56,030 --> 01:41:56,811
[SPEAKER_15]: I like that song a lot.

1335
01:41:56,831 --> 01:41:57,111
[SPEAKER_15]: I give it a 9.

1336
01:41:57,151 --> 01:41:57,191
[SPEAKER_15]: So...

1337
01:41:59,306 --> 01:41:59,726
[SPEAKER_15]: There you go.

1338
01:41:59,766 --> 01:42:01,588
[SPEAKER_15]: Those are your three picks for tonight.

1339
01:42:01,808 --> 01:42:02,468
[SPEAKER_15]: So here they are.

1340
01:42:02,508 --> 01:42:03,329
[SPEAKER_15]: Here's a quick clip.

1341
01:42:03,829 --> 01:42:04,830
[SPEAKER_15]: Clip of each song.

1342
01:42:05,330 --> 01:42:07,192
[SPEAKER_15]: And place vote now.

1343
01:42:07,372 --> 01:42:11,095
[SPEAKER_15]: You send your votes to Sky over a private message in the chat room.

1344
01:42:11,115 --> 01:42:11,475
[SPEAKER_15]: That's me.

1345
01:42:11,555 --> 01:42:11,955
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm Sky.

1346
01:42:11,995 --> 01:42:12,135
[SPEAKER_15]: Hi.

1347
01:42:12,175 --> 01:42:12,556
[SPEAKER_15]: How you doing?

1348
01:42:12,996 --> 01:42:16,759
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm in the chat room over at Calibamani.com.

1349
01:42:17,412 --> 01:42:20,933
[SPEAKER_15]: Click on Orange Lounge and click on chat, and then send me a private message with your vote.

1350
01:42:20,973 --> 01:42:22,213
[SPEAKER_15]: Song 1, Song 2, or Song 3.

1351
01:42:22,493 --> 01:42:24,513
[SPEAKER_15]: In case you forgot, here they are again.

1352
01:42:25,134 --> 01:42:29,995
[SPEAKER_15]: First off, last week's winner, Every Little Thing, Cybertrans, Face the Change.

1353
01:42:37,476 --> 01:42:42,017
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright, song number 2 you can vote for tonight, Tori Amos with Sugar, the Trance remix.

1354
01:42:52,974 --> 01:42:56,637
[SPEAKER_15]: or song number three, Danny Minow with Put the Needle On It, the Jason Evans mix.

1355
01:43:05,203 --> 01:43:05,543
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

1356
01:43:06,203 --> 01:43:06,704
[SPEAKER_15]: There you go.

1357
01:43:06,964 --> 01:43:07,905
[SPEAKER_15]: Place votes now.

1358
01:43:09,146 --> 01:43:09,646
[SPEAKER_21]: You know what?

1359
01:43:10,547 --> 01:43:11,607
[SPEAKER_21]: I think it's time to rant.

1360
01:43:12,548 --> 01:43:12,928
[SPEAKER_21]: All right.

1361
01:43:13,308 --> 01:43:18,252
[SPEAKER_21]: Not like the FUs of the week because our chat room has to respond to that, too, and they can't do that while they're voting.

1362
01:43:18,712 --> 01:43:19,793
[SPEAKER_15]: What now, Jamie?

1363
01:43:20,393 --> 01:43:21,134
[SPEAKER_15]: Just kidding.

1364
01:43:22,645 --> 01:43:23,105
[SPEAKER_15]: I love you.

1365
01:43:23,666 --> 01:43:23,966
[SPEAKER_21]: Hi.

1366
01:43:24,266 --> 01:43:24,506
[SPEAKER_15]: Hi.

1367
01:43:26,468 --> 01:43:32,292
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm ranting about retarded people.

1368
01:43:32,632 --> 01:43:37,896
[SPEAKER_15]: I just noticed you can see my construction table on the webcam.

1369
01:43:37,956 --> 01:43:38,716
[SPEAKER_15]: That's pretty cool.

1370
01:43:40,037 --> 01:43:40,478
[SPEAKER_15]: Let her rant.

1371
01:43:42,248 --> 01:43:44,489
[SPEAKER_15]: Just about... Don't rant about retarded people.

1372
01:43:44,529 --> 01:43:45,290
[SPEAKER_15]: They can't help it.

1373
01:43:45,830 --> 01:43:48,551
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm talking about people who aren't retarded but act retarded.

1374
01:43:48,871 --> 01:43:49,292
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, okay.

1375
01:43:50,032 --> 01:43:50,412
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay.

1376
01:43:51,453 --> 01:43:57,556
[SPEAKER_21]: Just people who have, like... People need to go to school before they're allowed on the internet.

1377
01:43:58,096 --> 01:44:03,238
[SPEAKER_21]: And I mean go to school and actually pass, like, grammar and spelling before they're allowed on the internet.

1378
01:44:03,478 --> 01:44:04,379
[SPEAKER_21]: People need... I think...

1379
01:44:05,043 --> 01:44:10,089
[SPEAKER_21]: You know, I was reading on my mailing list for J-List how there's like a test for everything in Japan.

1380
01:44:10,730 --> 01:44:15,255
[SPEAKER_21]: You know, like your fluency levels, there's a test to play baseball good enough.

1381
01:44:15,835 --> 01:44:16,817
[SPEAKER_21]: There's tests for everything.

1382
01:44:17,037 --> 01:44:18,679
[SPEAKER_21]: They need to have tests for everything here.

1383
01:44:19,780 --> 01:44:23,544
[SPEAKER_21]: Where, like, you have to have a certain level of proficiency before you're allowed to breathe.

1384
01:44:24,726 --> 01:44:24,786
[SPEAKER_21]: Or...

1385
01:44:26,358 --> 01:44:27,198
[SPEAKER_21]: Maybe not that extreme.

1386
01:44:27,578 --> 01:44:38,141
[SPEAKER_21]: But like, you know, you have your internet level proficiency, so when you log into the internet, you have this number that you can go on the web with and be allowed to type.

1387
01:44:38,882 --> 01:44:53,946
[SPEAKER_21]: Or, you know, have your degree of, you know, like with driving too, you need to keep testing, but you know, when you reach a certain age, you need to take like the I'm still okay to drive test, or

1388
01:44:55,575 --> 01:45:01,080
[SPEAKER_15]: And in some cases, especially with driving, when you get to a certain age, you need to take it every year.

1389
01:45:01,540 --> 01:45:01,740
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

1390
01:45:02,921 --> 01:45:07,385
[SPEAKER_15]: When you get to 65, you have to... In fact, when you're like 85, you need a monthly exam.

1391
01:45:07,865 --> 01:45:11,908
[SPEAKER_15]: And they need to make sure that you can see over the fucking dashboard.

1392
01:45:12,629 --> 01:45:12,869
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1393
01:45:12,889 --> 01:45:17,853
[SPEAKER_21]: You're also... You also need to... what?

1394
01:45:18,154 --> 01:45:20,956
[SPEAKER_15]: Especially if you're a little Asian woman in the Bay Area with SUV.

1395
01:45:21,136 --> 01:45:21,396
[SPEAKER_15]: SUV.

1396
01:45:25,331 --> 01:45:26,273
[SPEAKER_21]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1397
01:45:37,541 --> 01:45:41,323
[SPEAKER_21]: with, uh, you need to, like, take the parental responsibility test.

1398
01:45:41,523 --> 01:45:45,085
[SPEAKER_15]: You think it wouldn't be that, you wouldn't need that much intelligence to be a parent?

1399
01:45:45,485 --> 01:45:47,466
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, all you gotta do is put it in the right hole.

1400
01:45:47,506 --> 01:45:48,727
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, that's pretty much it.

1401
01:45:48,747 --> 01:45:51,889
[SPEAKER_21]: No, that's, that's, that in and of itself is just breeding.

1402
01:45:52,349 --> 01:45:57,712
[SPEAKER_21]: People can fucking, fucking, fucking fuck all they want to and, you know, sprout babies like bunnies.

1403
01:45:57,992 --> 01:46:00,153
[SPEAKER_15]: I think it's all the stuff that they're taking while they're breeding.

1404
01:46:00,934 --> 01:46:05,896
[SPEAKER_21]: But I think that, you know, there's, there's not many responsible parents around these days, you know?

1405
01:46:06,377 --> 01:46:06,797
[SPEAKER_21]: Don't you agree?

1406
01:46:06,817 --> 01:46:06,897
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah.

1407
01:46:08,357 --> 01:46:14,561
[SPEAKER_21]: And, you know, the people that I know personally, I'd say they're fairly responsible.

1408
01:46:14,781 --> 01:46:19,323
[SPEAKER_21]: Me, I know I'm not responsible enough right now to be a parent, so I'm not going to go out and do something.

1409
01:46:19,443 --> 01:46:21,465
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm not even responsible enough to own a pet.

1410
01:46:22,445 --> 01:46:23,205
[SPEAKER_21]: I have a Shermie.

1411
01:46:24,466 --> 01:46:28,228
[SPEAKER_21]: But Shermie poops in a box, and I only have to clean up after her once a day.

1412
01:46:30,269 --> 01:46:30,550
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay?

1413
01:46:31,050 --> 01:46:33,011
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't have to change a diaper 20 million times a day.

1414
01:46:35,392 --> 01:46:35,612
[SPEAKER_21]: Right?

1415
01:46:35,913 --> 01:46:36,113
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

1416
01:46:36,353 --> 01:46:36,573
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, yeah.

1417
01:46:38,180 --> 01:46:52,866
[SPEAKER_21]: I think, it's just, I was, I was, when I was out and about earlier in the week, I was just noticing, you know, little children running off to do whatever and their parents were sitting there on their cell phones.

1418
01:46:53,684 --> 01:46:54,685
[SPEAKER_21]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com

1419
01:47:21,577 --> 01:47:38,772
[SPEAKER_21]: That's why, and I was thinking of this when I was listening to, you know, I was very, very, you know, I guess proud when I was listening to Vandalist talk about, you know, how much time and care they take into, you know, he takes with his family.

1420
01:47:39,233 --> 01:47:41,154
[SPEAKER_21]: I just wish that there were more people like that, you know.

1421
01:47:41,194 --> 01:47:45,238
[SPEAKER_15]: They should limit families to have only one child, just like they do in China.

1422
01:47:45,598 --> 01:47:48,019
[SPEAKER_21]: No, I think that people... And you're being a fascist.

1423
01:47:48,419 --> 01:47:51,140
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, you can't literally step in there.

1424
01:47:51,160 --> 01:47:52,681
[SPEAKER_15]: This is America, land of the free.

1425
01:47:52,721 --> 01:47:54,282
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, as great of an idea as it sounds.

1426
01:47:54,582 --> 01:47:58,443
[SPEAKER_15]: And there should be certain people that are limited to one child or zero child.

1427
01:47:58,523 --> 01:47:59,344
[SPEAKER_15]: It's not possible.

1428
01:47:59,364 --> 01:48:09,248
[SPEAKER_21]: Child services don't step in, you know, for neglect until the child's already dead, left in their car for five hours, you know, burned to death or asphyxiated or whatever.

1429
01:48:09,968 --> 01:48:10,328
[SPEAKER_21]: You know, I...

1430
01:48:12,089 --> 01:48:19,437
[SPEAKER_21]: I just really think that it's very sad and I needed to take a moment to get that out of my system because, you know, this was on the news just, what, last week?

1431
01:48:20,278 --> 01:48:23,902
[SPEAKER_21]: Or like, you know, with Disneyland with the gum on the rail, you know?

1432
01:48:24,643 --> 01:48:26,805
[SPEAKER_21]: Stupid child, parent wasn't watching, you know?

1433
01:48:28,547 --> 01:48:32,431
[SPEAKER_15]: There was probably a little kid looking for a quarter on the track and that's how the train derailed.

1434
01:48:33,749 --> 01:48:37,030
[SPEAKER_21]: It's, you know, people need to take responsibility.

1435
01:48:37,150 --> 01:48:44,032
[SPEAKER_15]: Now, since I brought up Disneyland again, all the cool rides have gone away because of stupid people.

1436
01:48:44,332 --> 01:48:46,352
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, look at, like, the People Mover.

1437
01:48:46,372 --> 01:48:49,753
[SPEAKER_15]: The People Mover, while slow, was a good way... He did not get rid of the People Mover.

1438
01:48:50,133 --> 01:48:50,793
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, he did.

1439
01:48:50,953 --> 01:48:51,314
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, my God.

1440
01:48:51,394 --> 01:48:52,714
[SPEAKER_02]: They got rid of the People Mover.

1441
01:48:52,734 --> 01:48:52,994
[SPEAKER_02]: They got it...

1442
01:48:55,362 --> 01:48:57,062
[SPEAKER_15]: Disneyland did not get rid of the PeopleMover, did they?

1443
01:48:57,242 --> 01:48:58,903
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, like, you can go to hell.

1444
01:48:59,243 --> 01:49:00,523
[SPEAKER_15]: I hope all their rides derail.

1445
01:49:00,563 --> 01:49:03,224
[SPEAKER_15]: The PeopleMover was the coolest thing on the entire planet.

1446
01:49:03,404 --> 01:49:04,764
[SPEAKER_15]: And if they got rid of it, oh!

1447
01:49:05,444 --> 01:49:06,505
[SPEAKER_15]: You know why they got rid of it?

1448
01:49:06,525 --> 01:49:10,225
[SPEAKER_15]: Because some dumb fuck thought it'd be a cool idea to rock the thing and it fell over.

1449
01:49:10,245 --> 01:49:11,286
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, then kill him!

1450
01:49:11,526 --> 01:49:12,086
[SPEAKER_15]: Just kill him!

1451
01:49:12,446 --> 01:49:14,466
[SPEAKER_15]: Give me a gun, I'll shoot the fucker myself.

1452
01:49:14,486 --> 01:49:15,827
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, actually, he did die.

1453
01:49:15,867 --> 01:49:18,227
[SPEAKER_15]: Don't tell me they got rid of Mr. Toad's Wild Ride.

1454
01:49:18,247 --> 01:49:19,167
[SPEAKER_00]: No, they didn't get rid of that.

1455
01:49:19,187 --> 01:49:19,988
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm driving to Anaheim right now.

1456
01:49:20,008 --> 01:49:21,268
[SPEAKER_15]: But then they replaced the PeopleMover...

1457
01:49:22,186 --> 01:49:26,307
[SPEAKER_15]: They replaced the, um, what was it, the people movers?

1458
01:49:26,467 --> 01:49:30,869
[SPEAKER_15]: No, it's not gone, but it's not working.

1459
01:49:30,889 --> 01:49:32,309
[SPEAKER_21]: Submarine's gone.

1460
01:49:33,169 --> 01:49:35,810
[SPEAKER_15]: Are they going to get rid of the teacups because someone got sick?

1461
01:49:36,130 --> 01:49:38,611
[SPEAKER_15]: Look, you stupid bitch, you can see how the ride works.

1462
01:49:38,631 --> 01:49:41,612
[SPEAKER_15]: You're going to spin around and around and around and around about a...

1463
01:49:42,276 --> 01:49:43,817
[SPEAKER_15]: That was in goddamn time.

1464
01:49:44,257 --> 01:49:46,879
[SPEAKER_15]: If you don't think you can't handle it without puking, then fuck off.

1465
01:49:55,638 --> 01:49:58,079
[SPEAKER_15]: They're basically these things that go really fast.

1466
01:49:58,499 --> 01:50:03,721
[SPEAKER_15]: Like, they just have the acceleration rate on them is just ungodly, like, huge.

1467
01:50:04,241 --> 01:50:10,983
[SPEAKER_15]: But that's the problem was is, I don't know, someone did something in that one, like stood up or something, and they died too on that.

1468
01:50:11,663 --> 01:50:14,744
[SPEAKER_21]: So that's why those guys... Maybe someone should die on It's a Small World.

1469
01:50:15,224 --> 01:50:17,445
[SPEAKER_21]: They will never ever have to have it again.

1470
01:50:18,165 --> 01:50:19,185
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, God, I wish.

1471
01:50:19,826 --> 01:50:21,106
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a Small World is so lame.

1472
01:50:21,146 --> 01:50:23,787
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, that's the other thing is that it takes someone dying...

1473
01:50:24,560 --> 01:50:26,641
[SPEAKER_21]: And then they get rid of things that other people have in front of them.

1474
01:50:26,682 --> 01:50:28,463
[SPEAKER_15]: They better not get rid of Thunder Mountain Railroad.

1475
01:50:28,483 --> 01:50:29,423
[SPEAKER_15]: That ride rocked.

1476
01:50:29,543 --> 01:50:29,864
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

1477
01:50:30,224 --> 01:50:38,349
[SPEAKER_21]: No, they're probably going to turn it into, you know, like, I don't know, Daffy Duck's, you know, piano adventure.

1478
01:50:38,369 --> 01:50:38,690
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't know.

1479
01:50:38,750 --> 01:50:40,051
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm thinking of Roger Rabbit.

1480
01:50:40,331 --> 01:50:42,592
[SPEAKER_15]: Piano adventure, so there's a piano on a track.

1481
01:50:42,833 --> 01:50:43,993
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a runaway piano.

1482
01:50:46,474 --> 01:50:48,496
[SPEAKER_15]: People do not know what the People Mover is in our chat room.

1483
01:50:48,516 --> 01:50:52,099
[SPEAKER_15]: That's fine, because we have people from all parts of the world that listen to Orange Entree.

1484
01:50:52,119 --> 01:50:53,941
[SPEAKER_15]: The People Mover is a ride at Disneyland.

1485
01:50:54,001 --> 01:50:56,823
[SPEAKER_15]: It's in Tomorrow World, because Disneyland is broken up into all these little areas.

1486
01:50:56,843 --> 01:51:04,070
[SPEAKER_15]: You have the New Orleans section, and the jungle section, and you have Tomorrowland, which is all the futuristic stuff.

1487
01:51:04,090 --> 01:51:05,231
[SPEAKER_15]: That's where the Star Wars ride is.

1488
01:51:05,971 --> 01:51:09,174
[SPEAKER_15]: We all know, yeah, 50 years ago anyway, it was the Tomorrow stuff.

1489
01:51:09,494 --> 01:51:15,058
[SPEAKER_15]: But, you know, that's where Captain Neo was, that's where Space Mountain is.

1490
01:51:15,158 --> 01:51:27,508
[SPEAKER_15]: Anyway, so, PeopleMover was this little ride, and you sat on it, and you just, it was like a little trolley, and you went all around Tomorrow World, and it gave you a little lecture about all the little things that were going on, but the end of it,

1491
01:51:28,243 --> 01:51:29,503
[SPEAKER_15]: It was narrated by Tim Curry.

1492
01:51:29,523 --> 01:51:32,504
[SPEAKER_15]: And if they got rid of the people mover, Disneyland could go fuck itself.

1493
01:51:48,513 --> 01:51:51,655
[SPEAKER_21]: There wasn't too big of a line for me to go on the PeopleMover the one time I've been.

1494
01:51:52,335 --> 01:51:53,456
[SPEAKER_15]: See, that was the funny thing.

1495
01:51:53,816 --> 01:51:55,237
[SPEAKER_15]: It wasn't every time.

1496
01:51:55,557 --> 01:52:00,020
[SPEAKER_15]: No one used to go on the PeopleMover because it was like, ooh, PeopleMover is Space Mountain.

1497
01:52:00,060 --> 01:52:01,261
[SPEAKER_15]: We'll go on Space Mountain.

1498
01:52:01,541 --> 01:52:03,742
[SPEAKER_15]: PeopleMover is just like, I'm tired of walking.

1499
01:52:03,762 --> 01:52:05,463
[SPEAKER_15]: I just want to sit down for a little bit.

1500
01:52:05,763 --> 01:52:06,084
[SPEAKER_15]: It was great.

1501
01:52:06,104 --> 01:52:07,545
[SPEAKER_21]: You know they've been doing Space Mountain now.

1502
01:52:09,366 --> 01:52:11,387
[SPEAKER_21]: Space Mountain is closed for renovations.

1503
01:52:12,347 --> 01:52:13,388
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, because it sucks.

1504
01:52:13,428 --> 01:52:14,029
[SPEAKER_15]: It's old.

1505
01:52:14,169 --> 01:52:15,950
[SPEAKER_21]: I've only been on it once, so it was fun for me.

1506
01:52:16,170 --> 01:52:18,031
[SPEAKER_15]: They had techno music in there.

1507
01:52:19,417 --> 01:52:20,057
[SPEAKER_15]: That'd rock.

1508
01:52:20,478 --> 01:52:23,540
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, anyway, back to... What was I ranting about?

1509
01:52:23,600 --> 01:52:24,220
[SPEAKER_21]: Stupid people?

1510
01:52:24,701 --> 01:52:25,041
[SPEAKER_21]: Kids.

1511
01:52:25,061 --> 01:52:25,982
[SPEAKER_21]: Kids, yeah, kids.

1512
01:52:26,822 --> 01:52:29,564
[SPEAKER_15]: They need a ride that's just like F-Zero.

1513
01:52:30,205 --> 01:52:35,028
[SPEAKER_21]: I think that kids will grow up better if they had the same exposure to stuff that we had.

1514
01:52:35,088 --> 01:52:35,969
[SPEAKER_21]: They need tetherball.

1515
01:52:37,327 --> 01:52:43,591
[SPEAKER_21]: Children eat tether balls so that, you know, if you get hit in the head enough times, you know, duck, dodge the ball.

1516
01:52:44,272 --> 01:52:50,016
[SPEAKER_15]: Parents have to understand that there's a certain percentage of kids that will get raped and molested by people.

1517
01:52:50,396 --> 01:52:54,059
[SPEAKER_15]: Just accept the fact and hope that your kids aren't part of the statistic.

1518
01:52:54,339 --> 01:52:56,280
[SPEAKER_15]: You can't protect them from everything.

1519
01:52:56,681 --> 01:52:58,942
[SPEAKER_21]: You have to prepare them as best as you can.

1520
01:52:59,042 --> 01:53:00,123
[SPEAKER_21]: Take responsibility.

1521
01:53:00,383 --> 01:53:02,065
[SPEAKER_15]: Molestation builds character.

1522
01:53:02,125 --> 01:53:02,565
[SPEAKER_21]: No, it doesn't.

1523
01:53:04,326 --> 01:53:04,967
[SPEAKER_21]: No, it doesn't.

1524
01:53:05,167 --> 01:53:06,288
[SPEAKER_21]: Don't talk about that.

1525
01:53:08,510 --> 01:53:11,752
[SPEAKER_21]: But, you know, they take away everything.

1526
01:53:11,772 --> 01:53:15,333
[SPEAKER_21]: You know, all the stuff that we had when we were kids, you know, that stuff was cool.

1527
01:53:15,393 --> 01:53:21,756
[SPEAKER_21]: We had, you know, I fell off of the freaking, you know, monkey bars before, busted my lip open.

1528
01:53:21,776 --> 01:53:22,777
[SPEAKER_21]: I have a scar right here, see.

1529
01:53:24,346 --> 01:53:26,927
[SPEAKER_21]: and I'm perfectly well adjusted.

1530
01:53:27,187 --> 01:53:28,048
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, I cried.

1531
01:53:28,528 --> 01:53:29,188
[SPEAKER_21]: Ow, you know.

1532
01:53:29,888 --> 01:53:32,209
[SPEAKER_21]: I was stupid and I never fell off of the monkey bars again.

1533
01:53:33,330 --> 01:53:36,871
[SPEAKER_15]: What's up with these pansy playground equipment that they have now?

1534
01:53:36,911 --> 01:53:37,692
[SPEAKER_15]: It's all like powder.

1535
01:53:37,852 --> 01:53:38,272
[SPEAKER_15]: Plastic.

1536
01:53:38,732 --> 01:53:39,433
[SPEAKER_15]: Plastic.

1537
01:53:39,753 --> 01:53:41,013
[SPEAKER_15]: Whatever happened to the really cool wood stuff?

1538
01:53:41,033 --> 01:53:43,994
[SPEAKER_21]: You're going to get rid of sand boxes next because children are going to eat sand.

1539
01:53:44,815 --> 01:53:45,795
[SPEAKER_21]: I ate my pies.

1540
01:53:46,195 --> 01:53:46,576
[SPEAKER_21]: Look at me.

1541
01:53:46,636 --> 01:53:47,076
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm normal.

1542
01:53:47,596 --> 01:53:48,857
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, relatively.

1543
01:53:49,837 --> 01:53:51,998
[SPEAKER_21]: I grew up mostly adjusted.

1544
01:53:53,729 --> 01:53:55,630
[SPEAKER_21]: You know, forget this.

1545
01:53:56,210 --> 01:53:58,351
[SPEAKER_21]: When I was back in Alabama, I went by my elementary school.

1546
01:53:59,551 --> 01:54:10,096
[SPEAKER_21]: And I swear, all the metal things that I used to climb on, only a couple of them were there and they were rusted over so that nobody would want to touch them because they looked nasty.

1547
01:54:10,996 --> 01:54:12,317
[SPEAKER_21]: It's not fun anymore.

1548
01:54:12,857 --> 01:54:14,238
[SPEAKER_21]: Not fun to be a kid these days.

1549
01:54:14,578 --> 01:54:19,800
[SPEAKER_21]: Especially with the Teletubbies teaching you that it's okay to go up to a perfect stranger and give them a hug.

1550
01:54:21,084 --> 01:54:22,025
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, yeah, yeah!

1551
01:54:22,465 --> 01:54:23,366
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm going to hug you.

1552
01:54:23,426 --> 01:54:24,667
[SPEAKER_20]: Oop, watch me be a kid now.

1553
01:54:24,687 --> 01:54:25,568
[SPEAKER_20]: You're so retarded.

1554
01:54:25,748 --> 01:54:28,791
[SPEAKER_20]: You missed the whole thing we just did, so we're going to do it again.

1555
01:54:29,191 --> 01:54:31,534
[SPEAKER_21]: You know, the world is not bright sunshine.

1556
01:54:31,594 --> 01:54:33,015
[SPEAKER_21]: Repetition is fun.

1557
01:54:33,035 --> 01:54:37,579
[SPEAKER_21]: You know, when I was little... You know, okay, you know what I was raised with when I was five?

1558
01:54:37,599 --> 01:54:39,541
[SPEAKER_21]: I freaking had...

1559
01:54:40,299 --> 01:54:41,720
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, what did I watch when I was a kid?

1560
01:54:42,380 --> 01:54:48,622
[SPEAKER_21]: I watched the Smurfs, and the Smurfs taught you that there's fire and it burns down the trees, and the wolf's not a happy singing place.

1561
01:54:48,682 --> 01:54:50,543
[SPEAKER_15]: And the Smurfs promote homosexuality.

1562
01:54:50,603 --> 01:54:51,023
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes, they do.

1563
01:54:52,043 --> 01:54:56,145
[SPEAKER_21]: Except when they got, you know, Smurfette, but I think that, you know... Smurfette.

1564
01:54:56,245 --> 01:54:58,125
[SPEAKER_15]: It was like a colony of ants.

1565
01:54:58,706 --> 01:54:59,986
[SPEAKER_15]: They all fucked the queen.

1566
01:55:00,866 --> 01:55:03,107
[SPEAKER_21]: And then when I was... How old was I?

1567
01:55:03,127 --> 01:55:03,107
1983?

1568
01:55:03,147 --> 01:55:03,407
[SPEAKER_21]: 84?

1569
01:55:03,167 --> 01:55:03,407
[SPEAKER_21]: I was about...

1570
01:55:09,553 --> 01:55:16,135
[SPEAKER_21]: 7, the best show ever came on TV, Transformers, at Transformers at G.I.

1571
01:55:16,155 --> 01:55:16,475
[SPEAKER_21]: Joe.

1572
01:55:17,436 --> 01:55:23,518
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, there's a different Transformers than the one with these little Transformers that they protect, and it's like Pokemon.

1573
01:55:23,538 --> 01:55:24,298
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, forget it.

1574
01:55:24,538 --> 01:55:26,619
[SPEAKER_21]: You know, I don't watch that Armada crap.

1575
01:55:27,639 --> 01:55:29,680
[SPEAKER_15]: Or what about the ones where they turned into dinosaurs?

1576
01:55:29,740 --> 01:55:31,521
[SPEAKER_15]: I love that one, and apes and stuff.

1577
01:55:31,541 --> 01:55:32,741
[SPEAKER_21]: Hey, don't forget about Xenobots.

1578
01:55:34,522 --> 01:55:35,122
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, whatever.

1579
01:55:35,742 --> 01:55:36,843
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay.

1580
01:55:37,043 --> 01:55:44,446
[SPEAKER_21]: But, you know, I had, what, Jason the Wheel Warriors, we had Voltron, we had... Now, what is there to watch on TV now?

1581
01:55:45,686 --> 01:55:48,527
[SPEAKER_15]: Pokemon, Digimon... Digimon's cool, don't mock Digimon.

1582
01:55:49,147 --> 01:55:50,948
[SPEAKER_21]: But Pokemon's retarded, okay?

1583
01:55:52,108 --> 01:55:52,728
[SPEAKER_15]: Yu-Gi-Oh!

1584
01:55:52,868 --> 01:55:54,849
[SPEAKER_21]: And Digimon people die, okay?

1585
01:55:55,149 --> 01:55:56,930
[SPEAKER_15]: Why are we teaching kids to play cards?

1586
01:55:57,742 --> 01:55:59,364
[SPEAKER_15]: Isn't that like, can I take it?

1587
01:55:59,705 --> 01:56:01,427
[SPEAKER_21]: That's the way it is.

1588
01:56:01,467 --> 01:56:04,731
[SPEAKER_21]: You're going to get a paper cut and get infected and die.

1589
01:56:06,486 --> 01:56:07,466
[SPEAKER_21]: And then cards will be banned.

1590
01:56:07,887 --> 01:56:09,548
[SPEAKER_15]: It was the same thing when we were kids.

1591
01:56:09,628 --> 01:56:12,430
[SPEAKER_15]: Every cartoon had its elaborate marking scheme that went with it.

1592
01:56:12,490 --> 01:56:16,573
[SPEAKER_15]: Like, everybody wanted the He-Man that you would punch it and the little thing would spin around and make it look like it was damaged.

1593
01:56:16,593 --> 01:56:17,995
[SPEAKER_21]: They don't have battle damage toys anymore, do they?

1594
01:56:18,055 --> 01:56:18,615
[SPEAKER_15]: I know!

1595
01:56:18,955 --> 01:56:19,876
[SPEAKER_15]: That's so stupid.

1596
01:56:19,896 --> 01:56:23,359
[SPEAKER_21]: You know, we had really cool things when we were young.

1597
01:56:23,379 --> 01:56:23,979
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll tell you what.

1598
01:56:24,279 --> 01:56:25,701
[SPEAKER_21]: I cry for today's children.

1599
01:56:25,721 --> 01:56:27,562
[SPEAKER_15]: You know what toy I played with more than anything, though?

1600
01:56:27,942 --> 01:56:29,283
[SPEAKER_15]: More than anything, what toy I played with?

1601
01:56:29,464 --> 01:56:29,804
[SPEAKER_15]: Legos.

1602
01:56:31,065 --> 01:56:32,726
[SPEAKER_21]: I had Lincoln Logs and they were made out of wood.

1603
01:56:32,906 --> 01:56:34,968
[SPEAKER_21]: And I got splinters in my fingers when I tried to break them.

1604
01:56:36,010 --> 01:56:36,371
[SPEAKER_15]: DarkSakura.com

1605
01:56:49,497 --> 01:56:51,738
[SPEAKER_15]: I built catapults with my Lincoln Logs.

1606
01:56:52,098 --> 01:56:54,979
[SPEAKER_15]: You put, like, one of those small ones on a nice, you know, roof piece.

1607
01:56:54,999 --> 01:56:55,719
[SPEAKER_15]: These rubber bands.

1608
01:56:55,939 --> 01:57:06,683
[SPEAKER_21]: And you can hit it just really hard and it goes... I would build parts of my houses with rubber bands so that I could make them collapsible so they would kill my little weeblemen that I put inside of them.

1609
01:57:07,244 --> 01:57:08,244
[SPEAKER_15]: Comment from the chat room.

1610
01:57:08,284 --> 01:57:09,925
[SPEAKER_15]: This is how you know it's all coming to an end.

1611
01:57:11,885 --> 01:57:12,386
[SPEAKER_15]: Guess what?

1612
01:57:12,426 --> 01:57:15,107
[SPEAKER_15]: Rice Princess says she saw Transformers on MTV.

1613
01:57:16,227 --> 01:57:16,867
[SPEAKER_21]: Can I cry?

1614
01:57:17,808 --> 01:57:18,728
[SPEAKER_15]: You may have a sniff now.

1615
01:57:19,713 --> 01:57:24,216
[SPEAKER_21]: Unless it was the old ones, but if it was the new crappy ones, then I'm going to try.

1616
01:57:24,236 --> 01:57:25,858
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, Naoki2DX's winner, Tinker Toys.

1617
01:57:25,898 --> 01:57:26,778
[SPEAKER_15]: Tinker Toys are the shit.

1618
01:57:26,838 --> 01:57:28,559
[SPEAKER_21]: I had Tinker Toys too.

1619
01:57:28,579 --> 01:57:29,160
[SPEAKER_15]: Construx.

1620
01:57:29,460 --> 01:57:29,940
[SPEAKER_15]: Construx.

1621
01:57:29,981 --> 01:57:31,742
[SPEAKER_15]: I had a whole fucking tub of Construx.

1622
01:57:32,751 --> 01:57:34,652
[SPEAKER_15]: I had the Tinker Toys that were life-size.

1623
01:57:34,832 --> 01:57:36,792
[SPEAKER_15]: They were the size of me, okay?

1624
01:57:37,152 --> 01:57:38,133
[SPEAKER_15]: They kicked ass.

1625
01:57:38,673 --> 01:57:40,854
[SPEAKER_15]: You could build giant things that hurt people.

1626
01:57:40,954 --> 01:57:44,955
[SPEAKER_15]: And they didn't have... They had, like, the building pieces were like PVC pipes.

1627
01:57:44,975 --> 01:57:48,556
[SPEAKER_15]: So, you know, you could fight with the pieces and you could, like, injure people.

1628
01:57:48,936 --> 01:57:49,677
[SPEAKER_15]: It was awesome.

1629
01:57:49,957 --> 01:57:51,837
[SPEAKER_15]: And Constructs, I had tons of those things.

1630
01:57:51,957 --> 01:57:52,998
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, my God, just tons.

1631
01:57:53,018 --> 01:57:53,458
[SPEAKER_21]: We had...

1632
01:57:54,358 --> 01:58:00,422
[SPEAKER_21]: We had these things that were like plastic, hard plastic sticks with foam on them.

1633
01:58:00,982 --> 01:58:02,503
[SPEAKER_21]: And you could beat each other up with foam.

1634
01:58:02,723 --> 01:58:05,965
[SPEAKER_21]: But if you took the foam off, they were sticks and you could whack people in the head with them.

1635
01:58:07,265 --> 01:58:10,787
[SPEAKER_21]: And like, toys were lethal when we were young.

1636
01:58:11,088 --> 01:58:12,408
[SPEAKER_21]: Growing up was survival.

1637
01:58:13,549 --> 01:58:14,970
[SPEAKER_21]: And look at us, we're strong.

1638
01:58:16,067 --> 01:58:17,889
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, because we're not dead from our toys.

1639
01:58:18,169 --> 01:58:22,733
[SPEAKER_15]: I think Pixie Dust is saying in the chat room that the Smurfs are a reminder of the Anna Nicole show.

1640
01:58:24,035 --> 01:58:24,475
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay.

1641
01:58:28,339 --> 01:58:30,821
[SPEAKER_15]: Anyway, how about the winner of the cage match?

1642
01:58:31,462 --> 01:58:31,802
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay.

1643
01:58:32,423 --> 01:58:33,964
[SPEAKER_15]: The winner of tonight's Orange Lounge cage match.

1644
01:58:33,984 --> 01:58:34,324
[SPEAKER_21]: Are you closing?

1645
01:58:35,065 --> 01:58:35,846
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, I'm closing.

1646
01:58:36,627 --> 01:58:37,507
[SPEAKER_15]: Eat your vegetables.

1647
01:58:39,489 --> 01:58:40,190
[SPEAKER_21]: More spinach.

1648
01:58:40,470 --> 01:58:41,091
[SPEAKER_21]: You need iron.

1649
01:58:42,212 --> 01:58:49,714
[SPEAKER_15]: The winner of tonight's Orange Lounge Cage Match, I'm actually somewhat surprised by this, but the chatroom did vote this one as the winner tonight.

1650
01:58:51,414 --> 01:58:56,216
[SPEAKER_15]: It is last week's winner, Every Little Thing, Face the Change.

1651
01:58:58,236 --> 01:59:03,277
[SPEAKER_15]: Once again, curse you, Loki, and your cursed trance music.

1652
01:59:04,738 --> 01:59:09,379
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright, so I think now's a good break time, huh?

1653
01:59:11,452 --> 01:59:14,193
[SPEAKER_15]: What do you say when we come back we let the real ranting begin, eh?

1654
01:59:15,194 --> 01:59:15,394
Sure.

1655
01:59:15,554 --> 01:59:16,955
[SPEAKER_15]: The FUs of the week when we come back.

1656
01:59:17,295 --> 01:59:21,476
[SPEAKER_15]: Also, before we get into the FUs of the week, though, I want to talk about my gaming experiences this week.

1657
01:59:21,496 --> 01:59:23,217
[SPEAKER_15]: Because I've actually been playing more video games this week.

1658
01:59:23,237 --> 01:59:24,217
[SPEAKER_15]: So I want to talk about some games.

1659
01:59:24,377 --> 01:59:24,958
[SPEAKER_15]: Gasp!

1660
01:59:25,238 --> 01:59:25,638
[SPEAKER_15]: Gasp.

1661
01:59:26,178 --> 01:59:27,979
[SPEAKER_15]: So, we'll be back.

1662
01:59:31,658 --> 01:59:47,307
[SPEAKER_07]: Dreamer Dreamer, take me in your dream Take me anywhere you please Boy, you're making me scream Dreamer Dreamer, life is just a dream If you wanna set me free Boy, you're making me scream Ooh, la-la-dee, la-la-da You've got a dreamer dreamer

1663
02:00:14,712 --> 02:00:15,920
[SPEAKER_11]: We rock the spot, no!

1664
02:00:50,165 --> 02:00:51,857
[SPEAKER_07]: You gotta dream of being a dream

1665
02:02:55,076 --> 02:02:55,960
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks for watching!

1666
02:04:15,891 --> 02:04:17,492
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, this is Mel B of RTF.

1667
02:04:17,852 --> 02:04:22,734
[SPEAKER_01]: And for an extra $1.99 a minute, my girlfriend Mel B can join us on all the fun together.

1668
02:04:23,454 --> 02:04:29,557
[SPEAKER_01]: But hey, if you're a broke ass like I am, why don't you come to one place that costs absolutely nothing to go to and still the fun is just as great.

1669
02:04:29,897 --> 02:04:31,778
[SPEAKER_01]: It's Orange Lounge Radio, Sunday nights.

1670
02:04:32,338 --> 02:04:36,740
[SPEAKER_01]: Kick it with me and you just might realize the best things in life are free.

1671
02:04:38,221 --> 02:04:39,301
[SPEAKER_01]: Hello, we're back.

1672
02:04:41,022 --> 02:04:41,963
[SPEAKER_21]: Uh, guess he's back.

1673
02:04:42,863 --> 02:04:42,943
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh.

1674
02:04:46,144 --> 02:04:47,765
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, Shark Skrull's back.

1675
02:04:47,805 --> 02:04:48,105
[SPEAKER_15]: Hello.

1676
02:04:48,645 --> 02:04:49,186
[SPEAKER_18]: Hello.

1677
02:04:49,786 --> 02:04:51,066
[SPEAKER_15]: So you're back finally.

1678
02:04:51,247 --> 02:04:52,427
[SPEAKER_15]: We were starting to worry a little bit.

1679
02:04:52,447 --> 02:04:53,728
[SPEAKER_15]: We were like, well, she's been gone a while.

1680
02:04:53,788 --> 02:04:54,348
[SPEAKER_15]: At least I was.

1681
02:04:54,588 --> 02:04:54,988
[SPEAKER_15]: I was worried.

1682
02:04:55,008 --> 02:04:57,130
[SPEAKER_18]: The freaking lights just take forever.

1683
02:04:57,170 --> 02:04:59,691
[SPEAKER_18]: Although I saw the funniest low-riding truck ever.

1684
02:05:00,391 --> 02:05:03,433
[SPEAKER_18]: Dude, it looked like its ass was dragging on the ground, and it had spinners.

1685
02:05:04,573 --> 02:05:05,073
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, God.

1686
02:05:05,314 --> 02:05:09,236
[SPEAKER_15]: Those are the most annoying things on the planet, those things that spin.

1687
02:05:09,596 --> 02:05:11,517
[SPEAKER_18]: I almost pulled out my ditch cam and took a picture of it.

1688
02:05:11,577 --> 02:05:13,938
[SPEAKER_18]: It was that bad, but he turned before I could do it.

1689
02:05:17,032 --> 02:05:21,015
[SPEAKER_18]: Spinners are horrible, and it's even worse on a low-riding truck that's dragging its ass on the ground.

1690
02:05:23,396 --> 02:05:24,277
[SPEAKER_18]: What did we see earlier?

1691
02:05:26,138 --> 02:05:26,619
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't remember.

1692
02:05:26,679 --> 02:05:27,439
[SPEAKER_18]: Tell them what we saw.

1693
02:05:28,039 --> 02:05:29,641
[SPEAKER_21]: We saw the ultimate of crap low-riders.

1694
02:05:29,681 --> 02:05:30,401
[SPEAKER_21]: It was so ghetto.

1695
02:05:30,921 --> 02:05:33,963
[SPEAKER_21]: It was, like, bad, like, paint job, red and white.

1696
02:05:34,764 --> 02:05:36,425
[SPEAKER_21]: And it was just, like, some crappy Chevy.

1697
02:05:37,966 --> 02:05:42,169
[SPEAKER_21]: And, no, the fearless sticker was the one in my house that was really crappy, too.

1698
02:05:43,027 --> 02:05:47,151
[SPEAKER_21]: You know, if your car looks like crap, make it look good before you put a sticker on it that has fearless on it.

1699
02:05:48,893 --> 02:05:53,018
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't... People just fear my car when I'm in it.

1700
02:05:55,520 --> 02:05:58,083
[SPEAKER_21]: My little Tercel can do some damage.

1701
02:06:00,986 --> 02:06:03,449
[SPEAKER_21]: I took a picture of my dream car, though, one of my dream cars.

1702
02:06:04,409 --> 02:06:08,331
[SPEAKER_21]: There was a 350Z in the parking lot in Madeira, so I took a picture of it because I want one.

1703
02:06:08,532 --> 02:06:09,092
[SPEAKER_15]: Madeira.

1704
02:06:09,792 --> 02:06:10,573
[SPEAKER_21]: Madeira.

1705
02:06:11,413 --> 02:06:12,434
[SPEAKER_15]: I had a fun time at the fair.

1706
02:06:12,454 --> 02:06:13,795
[SPEAKER_15]: That's a suburb of Fresno.

1707
02:06:14,335 --> 02:06:15,916
[SPEAKER_21]: I had a fun time at the fair, though.

1708
02:06:16,236 --> 02:06:17,397
[SPEAKER_15]: You went to Fresno.

1709
02:06:18,618 --> 02:06:19,818
[SPEAKER_21]: I did not go to Fresno.

1710
02:06:19,838 --> 02:06:22,180
[SPEAKER_21]: I went to some place.

1711
02:06:22,200 --> 02:06:24,401
[SPEAKER_15]: You went to a place that's worse than Fresno.

1712
02:06:24,421 --> 02:06:25,302
[SPEAKER_21]: Madeira District Fair.

1713
02:06:25,322 --> 02:06:31,325
[SPEAKER_21]: I still have this stain of blue on my hand, too, from where they stamped my hand.

1714
02:06:31,365 --> 02:06:32,126
[SPEAKER_21]: It looks like a bruise.

1715
02:06:34,469 --> 02:06:35,930
[SPEAKER_15]: Shall we get into the FUs of the week?

1716
02:06:36,430 --> 02:06:36,890
[SPEAKER_21]: Showa!

1717
02:06:42,133 --> 02:06:44,154
[SPEAKER_08]: This is the best part of the show.

1718
02:06:44,194 --> 02:06:48,336
Here is justice.

1719
02:06:48,396 --> 02:06:49,937
Here is punishment.

1720
02:06:49,997 --> 02:06:51,438
Here is... This is fucked up.

1721
02:06:52,478 --> 02:06:53,379
[SPEAKER_21]: Fuck being sick.

1722
02:06:54,900 --> 02:06:59,282
[SPEAKER_21]: Actually, that was real.

1723
02:07:00,162 --> 02:07:01,523
[SPEAKER_21]: Good timing, my lungs.

1724
02:07:02,484 --> 02:07:03,244
[SPEAKER_21]: Fuck being sick.

1725
02:07:05,149 --> 02:07:07,409
[SPEAKER_21]: Fuck trying to enjoy myself while being sick.

1726
02:07:08,290 --> 02:07:12,010
[SPEAKER_21]: Because I try and try and try, but being sick sort of overshadows it.

1727
02:07:12,511 --> 02:07:18,212
[SPEAKER_21]: And I had a very good time at the concert, so that was great, but I just felt horrible.

1728
02:07:18,232 --> 02:07:19,932
[SPEAKER_21]: And I've been sick since Tuesday.

1729
02:07:20,512 --> 02:07:29,254
[SPEAKER_21]: And it got bad enough for me to go to the doctor on Thursday, and I don't go to the doctor, so this is the first time I've actually been to a doctor on my own in seven years.

1730
02:07:30,274 --> 02:07:31,354
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes, I'm an angry girl.

1731
02:07:31,394 --> 02:07:32,194
[SPEAKER_21]: It's on my card.

1732
02:07:32,214 --> 02:07:32,275
[SPEAKER_21]: Duh.

1733
02:07:32,295 --> 02:07:32,775
[SPEAKER_21]: Um, you know...

1734
02:07:36,341 --> 02:07:43,246
[SPEAKER_21]: Fuck stupid people and parents who don't know how to take responsibility for their children.

1735
02:07:44,567 --> 02:07:47,910
[SPEAKER_21]: And fuck things that suck.

1736
02:07:49,591 --> 02:07:50,432
[SPEAKER_21]: And not having money.

1737
02:07:51,733 --> 02:07:53,474
[SPEAKER_21]: Not having money is the big suck of all.

1738
02:07:54,495 --> 02:07:57,957
[SPEAKER_21]: I could stand being sick if I had money because then I could go on the internet and shop.

1739
02:07:58,878 --> 02:07:59,739
[SPEAKER_21]: I can't even do that.

1740
02:08:00,479 --> 02:08:00,759
[SPEAKER_21]: Sick.

1741
02:08:02,140 --> 02:08:03,701
[SPEAKER_21]: So, yeah, that's not it.

1742
02:08:03,761 --> 02:08:04,342
[SPEAKER_21]: Fuck being sick.

1743
02:08:06,043 --> 02:08:08,664
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, Loki, I know you're cooking, but it's your turn.

1744
02:08:09,784 --> 02:08:11,625
[SPEAKER_21]: He's making the bacon crap.

1745
02:08:14,546 --> 02:08:16,387
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, I don't believe that for a minute.

1746
02:08:16,427 --> 02:08:17,747
[SPEAKER_15]: Loki says he doesn't have anything.

1747
02:08:19,428 --> 02:08:19,888
[SPEAKER_15]: He's cooking.

1748
02:08:20,068 --> 02:08:22,409
[SPEAKER_15]: You're going to give up your chance to rant about something?

1749
02:08:22,469 --> 02:08:23,149
[SPEAKER_15]: Fuck cooking!

1750
02:08:23,989 --> 02:08:24,329
[SPEAKER_20]: Here.

1751
02:08:27,390 --> 02:08:32,692
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, yeah, F you to stuff.

1752
02:08:33,917 --> 02:08:34,818
[SPEAKER_15]: and stupid people.

1753
02:08:34,998 --> 02:08:37,499
[SPEAKER_15]: You actually had a good week and nobody bothered you.

1754
02:08:39,601 --> 02:08:40,181
[SPEAKER_15]: That's amazing.

1755
02:08:40,241 --> 02:08:40,922
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, no.

1756
02:08:41,542 --> 02:08:43,523
[SPEAKER_15]: I didn't have a good week and people bothered me.

1757
02:08:43,944 --> 02:08:45,344
[SPEAKER_15]: But it's not really anything out of the usual.

1758
02:08:46,485 --> 02:08:46,845
[SPEAKER_16]: I see.

1759
02:08:49,067 --> 02:08:51,068
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, it's because grease and fire don't mix.

1760
02:08:51,288 --> 02:08:52,349
[SPEAKER_12]: You're the one that I want.

1761
02:08:52,969 --> 02:08:55,171
[SPEAKER_12]: I want, I want to... I'll be back.

1762
02:08:55,371 --> 02:08:56,832
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm sure I'll interject something later.

1763
02:08:57,953 --> 02:08:58,553
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, hooray.

1764
02:08:59,374 --> 02:08:59,914
[SPEAKER_15]: My turn.

1765
02:09:03,286 --> 02:09:05,187
[SPEAKER_15]: My FU this week goes to Walmart.

1766
02:09:05,607 --> 02:09:06,987
[SPEAKER_15]: Because Walmart is evil.

1767
02:09:07,468 --> 02:09:10,189
[SPEAKER_15]: Walmart is the worst place on the face of the planet.

1768
02:09:10,309 --> 02:09:10,909
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll tell you why.

1769
02:09:12,190 --> 02:09:12,410
[SPEAKER_15]: Fine.

1770
02:09:12,430 --> 02:09:14,150
[SPEAKER_15]: All you're going to find is V8 Splash.

1771
02:09:16,411 --> 02:09:17,612
[SPEAKER_15]: I love V8 Splash.

1772
02:09:17,632 --> 02:09:19,032
[SPEAKER_15]: Because I don't drink soda anymore.

1773
02:09:19,132 --> 02:09:21,653
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll have the occasional diet, but I'm really trying to not do that.

1774
02:09:21,733 --> 02:09:22,834
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm really, really trying to not do that.

1775
02:09:23,194 --> 02:09:24,714
[SPEAKER_15]: So, V8.

1776
02:09:24,774 --> 02:09:26,495
[SPEAKER_15]: I have V8.

1777
02:09:26,595 --> 02:09:29,136
[SPEAKER_15]: Splash is mostly what I drink in iced tea and lemonade.

1778
02:09:29,856 --> 02:09:30,157
[SPEAKER_15]: Mixed.

1779
02:09:30,397 --> 02:09:30,837
[SPEAKER_15]: I like that, too.

1780
02:09:31,696 --> 02:09:34,798
[SPEAKER_15]: V8 Splash is good, especially Diet V8 Splash, because it's made with Splenda.

1781
02:09:35,538 --> 02:09:36,319
[SPEAKER_15]: It tastes like Propel.

1782
02:09:38,320 --> 02:09:40,601
[SPEAKER_15]: Anyway, my entry of the week goes to Walmart, because they suck.

1783
02:09:41,141 --> 02:09:45,944
[SPEAKER_15]: I went to Walmart on Saturday night with LankyStyle, because I wanted a new F-Zero game for GameCube.

1784
02:09:46,124 --> 02:09:49,826
[SPEAKER_15]: And I was all excited, because the new F-Zero game for GameCube is supposed to kick ass.

1785
02:09:50,246 --> 02:09:54,829
[SPEAKER_15]: And I had a $10 off at Walmart card, because my work gives out gift cards as incentives.

1786
02:09:54,849 --> 02:09:56,990
[SPEAKER_15]: So when we do something really good, we get a gift card.

1787
02:09:57,010 --> 02:09:58,571
[SPEAKER_15]: So I had a $10 gift card to Walmart.

1788
02:09:59,833 --> 02:10:04,895
[SPEAKER_15]: Because they ask people at work, what places would you like a gift card to?

1789
02:10:04,955 --> 02:10:06,135
[SPEAKER_15]: And people are like, Walmart.

1790
02:10:08,576 --> 02:10:11,117
[SPEAKER_15]: So, anyway, I decide I'm going to go to Walmart to get an F-Zero game.

1791
02:10:11,658 --> 02:10:12,198
[SPEAKER_15]: I get there.

1792
02:10:13,218 --> 02:10:13,959
[SPEAKER_15]: Nobody's there.

1793
02:10:14,599 --> 02:10:15,959
[SPEAKER_15]: Nobody's in the electronics department.

1794
02:10:16,019 --> 02:10:19,861
[SPEAKER_15]: So I just kind of stand at the desk and wait, because you know how they have the games in the case?

1795
02:10:20,141 --> 02:10:22,142
[SPEAKER_15]: You can't just reach in, pull out the game, take it to checkout.

1796
02:10:22,162 --> 02:10:25,263
[SPEAKER_15]: You have to get somebody to open the case for you so you can get the game.

1797
02:10:29,953 --> 02:10:34,596
[SPEAKER_15]: Heaven forbid you carry around a game as big as the DVDs that you can buy in the rack next door.

1798
02:10:36,197 --> 02:10:43,721
[SPEAKER_15]: Anyway, finally this nice lady, she looked over, she was stacking movies and she saw me and she came over and she said, can I help you type thing?

1799
02:10:43,741 --> 02:10:45,042
[SPEAKER_15]: And I said, yeah, I wanted to get that game.

1800
02:10:45,442 --> 02:10:47,123
[SPEAKER_15]: And she's like, oh, I don't have the key.

1801
02:10:47,223 --> 02:10:48,483
[SPEAKER_15]: Let me get somebody who can get the key.

1802
02:10:48,524 --> 02:10:50,505
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm like, they don't have the key behind the counter?

1803
02:10:50,605 --> 02:10:50,985
[SPEAKER_15]: Fine.

1804
02:10:51,885 --> 02:10:52,846
[SPEAKER_15]: Get the manager, get the key.

1805
02:10:53,954 --> 02:11:00,617
[SPEAKER_15]: So they get one of those people, after 10 minutes, at least 10 minutes, they get... Oops, sorry, my music ran out here.

1806
02:11:01,798 --> 02:11:12,302
[SPEAKER_15]: After at least 10 minutes, finally one of those folks in the red vests, who I guess are like, you know, super Walmart stars, or whatever they are, managers, assistant managers, whatever they are, they're the red vest people.

1807
02:11:13,103 --> 02:11:17,865
[SPEAKER_15]: At Walmart you have the blue vest people who are the normal drones, and the red vest people who command the blue drones, right?

1808
02:11:18,945 --> 02:11:20,206
[SPEAKER_15]: So a red vest came by...

1809
02:11:21,943 --> 02:11:23,344
[SPEAKER_15]: And he had the wrong key.

1810
02:11:23,424 --> 02:11:25,346
[SPEAKER_15]: He tried to open it up and he had the wrong key.

1811
02:11:25,426 --> 02:11:29,789
[SPEAKER_15]: And the woman who was there was like, no, no, no, you need the blue and green one, not the blue one.

1812
02:11:30,369 --> 02:11:32,170
[SPEAKER_15]: Apparently everything's color-coded at Walmart.

1813
02:11:33,591 --> 02:11:40,216
[SPEAKER_15]: So he leaves, and ten minutes later, after waiting another ten minutes, he comes back and says, I can't find it.

1814
02:11:42,257 --> 02:11:47,241
[SPEAKER_15]: So finally the lady says, I'm so sorry, I know where the key is, I'll go get it.

1815
02:11:47,791 --> 02:11:48,633
[SPEAKER_15]: So she goes off.

1816
02:11:48,713 --> 02:11:49,976
[SPEAKER_15]: Ten minutes later, she comes back.

1817
02:11:50,356 --> 02:11:51,559
[SPEAKER_15]: Sir, I'm so sorry.

1818
02:11:51,719 --> 02:11:53,102
[SPEAKER_15]: After a half hour now of waiting.

1819
02:11:53,603 --> 02:11:54,645
[SPEAKER_15]: Sir, I'm so sorry.

1820
02:11:55,407 --> 02:11:56,850
[SPEAKER_15]: The key isn't where it's supposed to be.

1821
02:11:58,607 --> 02:11:59,047
[SPEAKER_15]: What the fuck?

1822
02:11:59,067 --> 02:12:00,588
[SPEAKER_15]: Do you mean the key's not where it's supposed to be?

1823
02:12:00,829 --> 02:12:01,589
[SPEAKER_15]: Who opened the case?

1824
02:12:01,709 --> 02:12:05,112
[SPEAKER_15]: No one opened the case between the time I was there and when she was there.

1825
02:12:05,432 --> 02:12:06,553
[SPEAKER_15]: Where was the manager?

1826
02:12:06,593 --> 02:12:08,834
[SPEAKER_15]: Where was anybody running the electronics department?

1827
02:12:09,214 --> 02:12:10,395
[SPEAKER_15]: Why aren't things where they're supposed to be?

1828
02:12:10,615 --> 02:12:11,996
[SPEAKER_15]: Why isn't the key behind the counter?

1829
02:12:12,316 --> 02:12:14,078
[SPEAKER_15]: Why doesn't the red vest guy carry the key?

1830
02:12:14,138 --> 02:12:17,360
[SPEAKER_15]: Why doesn't he know what the hell color key goes with what?

1831
02:12:17,620 --> 02:12:19,321
[SPEAKER_15]: Doesn't he know how to run his own fucking store?

1832
02:12:20,062 --> 02:12:20,402
[SPEAKER_15]: Fuck.

1833
02:12:22,323 --> 02:12:25,265
[SPEAKER_15]: I was about to say, go to the hardware department and get me a hammer.

1834
02:12:25,305 --> 02:12:25,946
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll fix this.

1835
02:12:27,139 --> 02:12:27,839
[SPEAKER_15]: Seriously.

1836
02:12:28,940 --> 02:12:29,300
[SPEAKER_15]: So.

1837
02:12:31,121 --> 02:12:31,561
[SPEAKER_15]: God.

1838
02:12:31,941 --> 02:12:32,801
[SPEAKER_15]: So I didn't get my game.

1839
02:12:33,262 --> 02:12:33,842
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm pissed.

1840
02:12:34,222 --> 02:12:35,863
[SPEAKER_15]: I leave Walmart and I don't get anything.

1841
02:12:37,183 --> 02:12:38,744
[SPEAKER_15]: So I went the next day to Target.

1842
02:12:39,424 --> 02:12:40,645
[SPEAKER_15]: I purposely went to Target.

1843
02:12:40,685 --> 02:12:42,245
[SPEAKER_15]: I could have gone to GameSpot where I usually get games.

1844
02:12:42,325 --> 02:12:45,247
[SPEAKER_15]: No, I went to Target because I purposely wanted to buy it for the competition.

1845
02:12:45,747 --> 02:12:48,868
[SPEAKER_15]: So I went in and within two minutes there was a guy behind the desk.

1846
02:12:49,188 --> 02:12:51,369
[SPEAKER_15]: He opened the case up, got my game, rang it up right there.

1847
02:12:51,449 --> 02:12:53,090
[SPEAKER_15]: I was in and out of Target in three minutes.

1848
02:12:59,162 --> 02:12:59,482
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm done.

1849
02:12:59,983 --> 02:13:00,523
[SPEAKER_15]: Your turn, Melody.

1850
02:13:01,925 --> 02:13:03,707
[SPEAKER_18]: Wow, are you sure you want to do this?

1851
02:13:04,007 --> 02:13:04,227
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

1852
02:13:05,789 --> 02:13:11,075
[SPEAKER_18]: Fuck traffic, fuck red lights, fuck the cell phone reception in this damn area because it keeps dropping my hook.

1853
02:13:11,376 --> 02:13:15,861
[SPEAKER_18]: And fuck the fucking truck that's parked in Jamie's parking lot because I freaking hit it!

1854
02:13:19,047 --> 02:13:20,929
[SPEAKER_18]: And Jamie says she's almost hit it a bunch of times.

1855
02:13:20,969 --> 02:13:24,894
[SPEAKER_18]: And the funny thing is, you couldn't fucking tell that I hit the damn car.

1856
02:13:25,274 --> 02:13:28,598
[SPEAKER_18]: It's like so beat up and crappy, you can't even tell.

1857
02:13:29,539 --> 02:13:30,600
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, Jamie wants to elaborate.

1858
02:13:31,642 --> 02:13:33,744
[SPEAKER_21]: Fuck everybody who parks along that fence.

1859
02:13:34,485 --> 02:13:35,246
[SPEAKER_21]: Damn them all to hell.

1860
02:13:36,838 --> 02:13:42,082
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, it's like, it's parking spots, and then people parallel park right behind you, so it's like a freaking obstacle course.

1861
02:13:42,502 --> 02:13:46,846
[SPEAKER_18]: And I had a car trying to come in that was trying to hurry me up, but apparently I just went a little too far.

1862
02:13:46,906 --> 02:13:49,107
[SPEAKER_18]: And I couldn't see the truck, because it was right directly behind me.

1863
02:13:49,427 --> 02:13:51,329
[SPEAKER_18]: I was looking over my shoulder, but you couldn't tell.

1864
02:13:51,369 --> 02:13:52,510
[SPEAKER_18]: And I was like, oh, fuck.

1865
02:13:52,930 --> 02:13:57,273
[SPEAKER_18]: So, yeah, fuck that, and fuck having to drive home now, because I was stupid and forgot something.

1866
02:13:57,854 --> 02:13:59,875
[SPEAKER_18]: Anyway, I forgot my computer.

1867
02:14:00,255 --> 02:14:03,898
[SPEAKER_18]: So, fuck having to drive home, and fuck having to work tomorrow, because I really don't want to.

1868
02:14:10,044 --> 02:14:13,826
[SPEAKER_18]: Wow, okay.

1869
02:14:14,666 --> 02:14:15,587
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm angry tonight.

1870
02:14:17,348 --> 02:14:18,488
[SPEAKER_15]: Shall we hear from our chatroom?

1871
02:14:20,549 --> 02:14:21,270
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright, here they go.

1872
02:14:21,990 --> 02:14:22,770
[SPEAKER_15]: Chatroom FUs.

1873
02:14:24,852 --> 02:14:27,373
[SPEAKER_15]: DarkTetsuya says, F you to missing most of the show.

1874
02:14:27,953 --> 02:14:29,634
[SPEAKER_15]: And F you to morons at the theater.

1875
02:14:29,654 --> 02:14:33,476
[SPEAKER_15]: If you're gonna make cracks about the movie, that's what watching it at home is for.

1876
02:14:34,657 --> 02:14:36,218
[SPEAKER_15]: And F you not having Soul Calibur 2.

1877
02:14:37,236 --> 02:14:39,478
[SPEAKER_18]: Wait, I have to add something though there with the movie.

1878
02:14:39,558 --> 02:14:40,159
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, Shark Skrull.

1879
02:14:40,459 --> 02:14:42,301
[SPEAKER_18]: Sometimes that's better than the movie itself.

1880
02:14:42,501 --> 02:14:43,442
[SPEAKER_15]: I definitely agree.

1881
02:14:43,462 --> 02:14:44,903
[SPEAKER_15]: It really depends on the movie you're seeing.

1882
02:14:44,983 --> 02:14:50,388
[SPEAKER_15]: Because like, when we went and saw Pokemon, yelling back at the screen made it ten times better.

1883
02:14:51,349 --> 02:14:53,511
[SPEAKER_15]: Spice World, Case Point, thank you.

1884
02:14:57,589 --> 02:14:58,830
[SPEAKER_15]: I saw Spice World opening day too.

1885
02:14:58,850 --> 02:14:59,490
[SPEAKER_15]: High five!

1886
02:15:00,930 --> 02:15:02,571
[SPEAKER_21]: I saw Spice World for free.

1887
02:15:02,911 --> 02:15:04,392
[SPEAKER_21]: I didn't have to pay for it.

1888
02:15:04,452 --> 02:15:07,533
[SPEAKER_15]: We were going to dress as Spice Girls and everything, but we didn't have time.

1889
02:15:08,553 --> 02:15:11,054
[SPEAKER_15]: It was us and all these junior high girls.

1890
02:15:11,474 --> 02:15:12,915
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, we were the only people in the theater.

1891
02:15:12,955 --> 02:15:15,036
[SPEAKER_18]: My friend and I were the only people in the theater without a kid.

1892
02:15:15,116 --> 02:15:16,596
[SPEAKER_18]: It was kind of scary, actually.

1893
02:15:16,796 --> 02:15:17,957
[SPEAKER_15]: I had so much fun at Spice World.

1894
02:15:20,445 --> 02:15:21,245
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, I have the tape.

1895
02:15:21,966 --> 02:15:23,046
[SPEAKER_15]: I have a promo poster.

1896
02:15:23,146 --> 02:15:24,246
[SPEAKER_15]: I have a promo poster I won.

1897
02:15:25,347 --> 02:15:25,567
[SPEAKER_15]: Anyway.

1898
02:15:26,227 --> 02:15:27,107
[SPEAKER_21]: Back to the angst, please.

1899
02:15:28,568 --> 02:15:30,648
[SPEAKER_15]: But Spicer, I'm fine.

1900
02:15:30,828 --> 02:15:31,468
[SPEAKER_15]: 23rd Magus.

1901
02:15:31,629 --> 02:15:32,389
[SPEAKER_15]: He's pretty angsty.

[SPEAKER_15]: Now I'm not allowed to leave my bedroom after 1 a.m.

1908
02:15:48,114 --> 02:15:49,334
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, you can live in the dorms.

1909
02:15:50,146 --> 02:15:51,968
[SPEAKER_21]: What the fuck?

[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, wow, cool.

1930
02:17:35,328 --> 02:17:35,728
[SPEAKER_15]: He's cute.

1931
02:17:35,748 --> 02:17:36,388
[SPEAKER_15]: You should be his friend.

1932
02:17:36,648 --> 02:17:36,948
[SPEAKER_15]: Anyway.

1933
02:17:36,968 --> 02:17:39,309
[SPEAKER_18]: Put him on Friendster.

1934
02:17:41,010 --> 02:17:42,090
[SPEAKER_15]: Put him on Friendster.

1935
02:17:43,831 --> 02:17:44,151
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

1936
02:17:45,651 --> 02:17:47,592
[SPEAKER_15]: F you to the idiot who hit my neighbor's car.

1937
02:17:47,652 --> 02:17:49,793
[SPEAKER_15]: They hit the end trying to pull into his spot.

1938
02:17:49,833 --> 02:17:51,193
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, it was Shark's Girl.

1939
02:17:52,574 --> 02:17:55,455
[SPEAKER_15]: And my neighbor and myself watched as this happened.

1940
02:17:56,855 --> 02:18:01,057
[SPEAKER_15]: The guys just looked right at us, pulled out, and tried to hide further down in the parking lot.

1941
02:18:05,393 --> 02:18:08,094
[SPEAKER_15]: John Fields would like to clarify, or give another F you.

1942
02:18:08,114 --> 02:18:11,456
[SPEAKER_15]: F you to websites that force you to say yes to their install programs.

1943
02:18:11,877 --> 02:18:14,438
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm sick of hitting the power button on my computer because of them.

1944
02:18:15,238 --> 02:18:17,600
[SPEAKER_15]: Mozilla is your friend.

1945
02:18:17,680 --> 02:18:18,820
[SPEAKER_20]: Just click no.

1946
02:18:19,020 --> 02:18:23,443
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, stop going to porn and wear sites, because those are the only sites I know of that force you to click yes.

1947
02:18:24,183 --> 02:18:24,523
[SPEAKER_21]: No.

1948
02:18:24,924 --> 02:18:27,825
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, all you have to do is just use the Google toolbar.

1949
02:18:29,746 --> 02:18:30,467
[SPEAKER_12]: Pull out that four.

1950
02:18:32,348 --> 02:18:32,828
[SPEAKER_15]: Lastly...

1951
02:18:33,641 --> 02:18:37,704
[SPEAKER_15]: Pixie Dust says, well first off, a big F you to myself for getting a new tattoo.

1952
02:18:37,744 --> 02:18:39,565
[SPEAKER_15]: It is scabby and hurts me.

1953
02:18:39,985 --> 02:18:41,686
[SPEAKER_15]: So yeah, I'm not too comfy right now.

1954
02:18:43,327 --> 02:18:43,687
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know.

1955
02:18:43,767 --> 02:18:44,568
[SPEAKER_15]: What is it of?

1956
02:18:44,748 --> 02:18:45,729
[SPEAKER_15]: We want to hear it, Pixie Dust.

1957
02:18:46,249 --> 02:18:49,011
[SPEAKER_15]: The ugly mofo I went out with for a month in April.

1958
02:18:49,031 --> 02:18:51,212
[SPEAKER_15]: F you for ruining my birthday pics with your face.

1959
02:18:51,312 --> 02:18:52,213
[SPEAKER_15]: You remember him, Sky?

1960
02:18:52,233 --> 02:18:52,613
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, I do.

1961
02:18:53,153 --> 02:18:56,215
[SPEAKER_15]: And another F you goes to people who have been moody and bitchy around me.

1962
02:18:56,295 --> 02:18:58,497
[SPEAKER_15]: Get off your poopy ass toilet and get happy.

1963
02:19:02,219 --> 02:19:03,460
[SPEAKER_21]: That is the best thing ever.

1964
02:19:03,920 --> 02:19:06,222
[SPEAKER_15]: Get off your poopy ass toilet.

1965
02:19:06,402 --> 02:19:08,203
[SPEAKER_15]: Come on, get happy.

1966
02:19:08,644 --> 02:19:09,905
[SPEAKER_21]: Someone take that quote.

1967
02:19:10,425 --> 02:19:13,467
[SPEAKER_21]: Take that quote right now and post it in the Orange Islands Live Journal.

1968
02:19:13,667 --> 02:19:14,188
[SPEAKER_21]: Right now.

1969
02:19:15,049 --> 02:19:16,850
[SPEAKER_15]: Get off your poopy ass toilet and get happy.

1970
02:19:17,150 --> 02:19:18,251
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, post it now.

1971
02:19:18,291 --> 02:19:21,473
[SPEAKER_15]: I nominate DarkTetsuya to run that task because he always posts in the community.

1972
02:19:22,174 --> 02:19:23,315
[SPEAKER_15]: DarkTetsuya, get on that, please.

1973
02:19:24,716 --> 02:19:27,278
[SPEAKER_15]: Let me cut and paste for your copying pleasure here.

1974
02:19:28,378 --> 02:19:28,759
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1975
02:19:28,819 --> 02:19:29,659
[SPEAKER_15]: Don't tell me no.

1976
02:19:29,679 --> 02:19:29,719
[SPEAKER_15]: No.

1977
02:19:33,129 --> 02:19:34,710
[SPEAKER_15]: I think he's telling 23 Magus no.

1978
02:19:34,730 --> 02:19:36,070
[SPEAKER_15]: You can tell him no yo you want.

1979
02:19:38,031 --> 02:19:38,311
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright.

1980
02:19:38,971 --> 02:19:39,271
[SPEAKER_15]: Anyway.

1981
02:19:39,691 --> 02:19:40,752
[SPEAKER_15]: On with Pixie Dust FUs.

1982
02:19:41,232 --> 02:19:47,374
[SPEAKER_15]: By the way, I found the camera for my birthday dinner and that brings up all the bitchiness towards that asshole and the way he dubbed me.

1983
02:19:47,434 --> 02:19:49,575
[SPEAKER_15]: He was... You can do so much better than that, Janae.

1984
02:19:50,495 --> 02:19:52,256
[SPEAKER_15]: FU to Sky for not liking Walmart.

1985
02:19:52,276 --> 02:19:52,996
[SPEAKER_15]: Screw you too, bitch.

1986
02:19:53,576 --> 02:19:57,858
[SPEAKER_15]: It is ghetto, but hell, I got a new Razor with free refills for only five bucks.

1987
02:19:57,998 --> 02:19:58,318
[SPEAKER_15]: LOL.

1988
02:19:58,698 --> 02:20:01,939
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll get over the Walmart thing, but that made me mad.

1989
02:20:02,586 --> 02:20:03,326
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll get over it.

1990
02:20:03,406 --> 02:20:04,607
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll shop at Walmart again.

1991
02:20:05,167 --> 02:20:07,667
[SPEAKER_15]: But they can eat me.

1992
02:20:08,028 --> 02:20:13,909
[SPEAKER_15]: And I won't go to that one by Brad and Irene's house because there's a Target right there and Target's cooler.

1993
02:20:14,249 --> 02:20:15,710
[SPEAKER_15]: And they have good smelling soap.

1994
02:20:18,711 --> 02:20:21,371
[SPEAKER_15]: Fuck you to Los Rios District for stealing my money.

1995
02:20:24,112 --> 02:20:28,713
[SPEAKER_15]: Bunch of greedy bastards that want to take my money and not buying my book back or refunding my $54 fee.

1996
02:20:33,044 --> 02:20:33,564
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, done.

1997
02:20:33,584 --> 02:20:34,064
[SPEAKER_15]: Love you all.

1998
02:20:34,084 --> 02:20:34,504
[SPEAKER_15]: Mwah.

1999
02:20:38,026 --> 02:20:43,827
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, Loki wants to go now because he thought of something, and now he has bacon in his system, so... Can we get a mic over to Loki?

2000
02:20:44,308 --> 02:20:45,628
[SPEAKER_21]: Causing his angst level to rise.

2001
02:20:45,648 --> 02:20:45,948
[SPEAKER_15]: That's it.

2002
02:20:45,968 --> 02:20:46,308
[SPEAKER_15]: They're done.

2003
02:20:46,328 --> 02:20:46,928
[SPEAKER_15]: That was the last one.

2004
02:20:49,989 --> 02:20:53,871
[SPEAKER_15]: Have you seen Stupid News Reporters covering the Disneyland tragedy?

2005
02:20:54,691 --> 02:20:55,011
[SPEAKER_15]: Or, uh...

2006
02:20:57,225 --> 02:20:58,948
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, that's just stopping you.

2007
02:21:11,485 --> 02:21:14,386
[SPEAKER_15]: F you to Gray Davis, because you suck.

2008
02:21:15,266 --> 02:21:21,547
[SPEAKER_15]: And just because you think immigrants should now not drive, well, good for you.

2009
02:21:23,207 --> 02:21:25,008
[SPEAKER_15]: Hello, hello, hello.

2010
02:21:25,308 --> 02:21:26,988
[SPEAKER_15]: News alert, that's an assembly bill.

2011
02:21:27,768 --> 02:21:29,249
[SPEAKER_15]: It's not just Gray Davis.

2012
02:21:29,289 --> 02:21:31,669
[SPEAKER_15]: This is the only thing that bothers me about the recall.

2013
02:21:32,029 --> 02:21:36,210
[SPEAKER_15]: I think they should recall the entire fucking assembly, because Gray Davis gets blamed for all these bills.

2014
02:21:36,290 --> 02:21:39,871
[SPEAKER_15]: Sure, he signs them when he can veto them, but he's not the sole...

2015
02:21:40,666 --> 02:21:41,807
[SPEAKER_15]: What we do?

2016
02:21:41,867 --> 02:21:42,748
[SPEAKER_15]: He signs the bill.

2017
02:21:43,228 --> 02:21:43,989
[SPEAKER_15]: I sign a check.

2018
02:21:44,009 --> 02:21:44,549
[SPEAKER_15]: What's your point?

2019
02:21:46,771 --> 02:21:54,117
[SPEAKER_15]: Anyways, so, um, yeah, FD to Gray Davis, because, you know, you like illegal immigrants in the country because they do dirty work.

2020
02:21:54,877 --> 02:21:56,979
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, I think we should kick you out of the country because you suck.

2021
02:21:59,941 --> 02:22:01,042
[SPEAKER_15]: Somebody's stealing my bacon.

2022
02:22:01,062 --> 02:22:01,783
[SPEAKER_15]: Ass.

2023
02:22:01,983 --> 02:22:02,063
[SPEAKER_15]: Ass.

2024
02:22:04,935 --> 02:22:06,095
[SPEAKER_15]: My bacon.

2025
02:22:06,335 --> 02:22:07,416
[SPEAKER_15]: Mmm, super bacon.

2026
02:22:08,456 --> 02:22:09,356
[SPEAKER_15]: Mmm, bacon-y.

2027
02:22:09,376 --> 02:22:11,537
[SPEAKER_15]: Boy, this is super bacon.

2028
02:22:12,017 --> 02:22:12,257
[SPEAKER_15]: Is it?

2029
02:22:12,897 --> 02:22:13,817
[SPEAKER_15]: It's moderate super bacon.

2030
02:22:13,837 --> 02:22:14,797
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, it's moderate bacon.

2031
02:22:17,178 --> 02:22:19,719
[SPEAKER_15]: Melody really likes the autographed picture of Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen.

2032
02:22:21,419 --> 02:22:25,160
[SPEAKER_15]: That's just a temporary placeholder until I get the porno pictures of them.

2033
02:22:31,201 --> 02:22:31,441
[SPEAKER_16]: No.

2034
02:22:33,402 --> 02:22:33,702
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm done.

2035
02:22:37,816 --> 02:22:38,136
[SPEAKER_16]: All right.

2036
02:22:39,917 --> 02:22:41,658
[SPEAKER_15]: FUsOfTheWeekAreDone.com.

2037
02:22:42,179 --> 02:22:42,539
[SPEAKER_15]: Hooray.

2038
02:22:44,000 --> 02:22:45,261
[SPEAKER_15]: So I have something else on my mind.

2039
02:22:45,361 --> 02:22:46,881
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, Jamie has something to say?

2040
02:22:48,062 --> 02:22:49,283
[SPEAKER_21]: I want pancakes right now.

2041
02:22:50,664 --> 02:22:51,124
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, God.

2042
02:22:51,724 --> 02:22:53,525
[SPEAKER_15]: I wish there was like an IHOP near here.

2043
02:22:54,226 --> 02:22:55,967
[SPEAKER_15]: I want... Yeah, but it's closed.

2044
02:22:56,667 --> 02:22:56,908
[SPEAKER_15]: Isn't it?

2045
02:22:57,928 --> 02:22:58,308
[SPEAKER_15]: I think so.

2046
02:22:58,629 --> 02:22:59,769
[SPEAKER_21]: I want pumpkin pancakes.

2047
02:23:00,049 --> 02:23:01,030
[SPEAKER_15]: Besides, you had IHOP yesterday.

2048
02:23:01,050 --> 02:23:01,710
[SPEAKER_15]: You don't want it again today.

2049
02:23:01,730 --> 02:23:03,211
[SPEAKER_21]: I want pumpkin pancakes.

2050
02:23:03,231 --> 02:23:03,732
[SPEAKER_15]: And we have Mongolian.

2051
02:23:04,432 --> 02:23:06,353
[SPEAKER_15]: That means, you know, Mongolian means you go poop a lot.

2052
02:23:06,373 --> 02:23:07,334
[SPEAKER_21]: The Mongolian is sick again.

2053
02:23:08,399 --> 02:23:08,799
[SPEAKER_15]: You know what?

2054
02:23:09,299 --> 02:23:13,200
[SPEAKER_15]: I found a way to not have a diarrhea bomb after Mongolian today.

2055
02:23:14,201 --> 02:23:14,541
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

2056
02:23:14,961 --> 02:23:16,161
[SPEAKER_15]: I didn't put any oil in it.

2057
02:23:17,462 --> 02:23:19,382
[SPEAKER_15]: I only put about half the noodles I usually do.

2058
02:23:19,402 --> 02:23:20,423
[SPEAKER_15]: I put no oil in it.

2059
02:23:20,483 --> 02:23:23,164
[SPEAKER_15]: I put nothing but teriyaki sauce and sweet and sour sauce in it.

2060
02:23:23,404 --> 02:23:25,524
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm going to show you something.

2061
02:23:25,604 --> 02:23:26,665
[SPEAKER_21]: Do you see this bottle?

2062
02:23:26,825 --> 02:23:27,085
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

2063
02:23:27,485 --> 02:23:28,465
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm going to hold it up.

2064
02:23:29,586 --> 02:23:32,606
[SPEAKER_21]: I've got to cover my name because we have our names.

2065
02:23:32,967 --> 02:23:34,147
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, well, don't put it on the webcam.

2066
02:23:34,407 --> 02:23:34,967
[SPEAKER_21]: I am, too.

2067
02:23:35,047 --> 02:23:35,387
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

2068
02:23:36,668 --> 02:23:36,988
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, good.

2069
02:23:37,008 --> 02:23:37,608
[SPEAKER_21]: My name's not on here.

2070
02:23:39,195 --> 02:23:44,156
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, I'll let you know how long you have to hold it there.

2071
02:23:45,576 --> 02:23:47,357
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, it took a ghost picture.

2072
02:23:47,377 --> 02:23:48,637
[SPEAKER_15]: You got 50 seconds before it goes again.

2073
02:23:49,677 --> 02:23:51,157
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, so while we're waiting.

2074
02:23:51,637 --> 02:23:52,858
[SPEAKER_21]: Alright, look at that ghosty thing.

2075
02:23:52,958 --> 02:23:54,318
[SPEAKER_21]: That's erythromycin.

2076
02:23:54,838 --> 02:23:55,658
[SPEAKER_21]: It makes you poop.

2077
02:23:56,498 --> 02:23:58,639
[SPEAKER_21]: Never eat Mongolian barbecue when you're on antibiotics.

2078
02:23:59,459 --> 02:23:59,799
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

2079
02:24:00,259 --> 02:24:00,499
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

2080
02:24:01,579 --> 02:24:06,240
[SPEAKER_21]: Actually, the one thing that works better than this for going to the bathroom is sugar-free Hershey's dark chocolate.

2081
02:24:06,761 --> 02:24:10,566
[SPEAKER_15]: But today's Mongolian, I just want to say today's Mongolian only made me fart a lot.

2082
02:24:10,646 --> 02:24:13,810
[SPEAKER_15]: It did not make me go to the bathroom and just unload.

2083
02:24:23,283 --> 02:24:24,925
[SPEAKER_15]: Loki, can you say that in a microphone, please?

2084
02:24:28,604 --> 02:24:32,486
[SPEAKER_15]: Something that'll make you crap more is 746 All Purpose Cleanser.

2085
02:24:32,986 --> 02:24:35,527
[SPEAKER_15]: It's what they use to clean all the countertops and stuff at Roundtable.

2086
02:24:36,047 --> 02:24:39,829
[SPEAKER_15]: If they put that on your pizza and you eat it, it'll make you shit out.

2087
02:24:40,189 --> 02:24:45,411
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, someone did that to me once, and I never knew that that much crap could be in my body.

2088
02:24:45,992 --> 02:24:49,513
[SPEAKER_15]: I think I shit solid, like, I shit... Solid shit?

2089
02:24:50,414 --> 02:24:55,676
[SPEAKER_15]: No, I... I shit for a complete hour, like, just non-stop shitting.

2090
02:24:58,597 --> 02:24:59,797
[SPEAKER_15]: It's like going on a diet.

2091
02:25:00,097 --> 02:25:00,818
[SPEAKER_15]: It's like that stuff.

2092
02:25:01,198 --> 02:25:03,838
[SPEAKER_15]: No, I wonder if that's all that, you know that Hollywood diet?

2093
02:25:04,158 --> 02:25:18,162
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, the colon cleanser, the Hollywood diet that you can buy at Walgreens and you basically mix it with water and you're supposed to take it on a weekend because you don't want to take this at work because you're going to spend your weekend vacationing on the throne, vacationing on the porcelain throne.

2094
02:25:20,094 --> 02:25:23,535
[SPEAKER_15]: Bring a Game Boy and a bathroom reader because it's going to be a long weekend.

2095
02:25:23,735 --> 02:25:27,576
[SPEAKER_15]: That's the only place that, like, you know, the British Excel is in toilet technology.

2096
02:25:27,596 --> 02:25:31,017
[SPEAKER_15]: Because they have some really kick-ass toilets.

2097
02:25:31,037 --> 02:25:33,458
[SPEAKER_15]: Dude, why isn't the bidet huge here?

2098
02:25:33,518 --> 02:25:34,338
[SPEAKER_15]: That's what I want to know.

2099
02:25:35,539 --> 02:25:36,879
[SPEAKER_15]: Bidets are the shit.

2100
02:25:37,179 --> 02:25:38,080
[SPEAKER_15]: No pun intended.

2101
02:25:38,140 --> 02:25:39,760
[SPEAKER_15]: I would love to have a bidet.

2102
02:25:39,780 --> 02:25:40,600
[SPEAKER_15]: That would kick ass.

2103
02:25:40,740 --> 02:25:43,661
[SPEAKER_15]: I would... Japanese super toilet.

2104
02:25:43,801 --> 02:25:44,522
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, yeah.

2105
02:25:44,682 --> 02:25:46,962
[SPEAKER_15]: A Japanese super... Man.

2106
02:25:47,843 --> 02:25:48,503
[SPEAKER_15]: I want a bidet.

2107
02:25:49,318 --> 02:25:51,421
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's talk to our landlord and see if we can get a bidet in here.

2108
02:25:59,832 --> 02:26:00,072
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

2109
02:26:01,454 --> 02:26:02,515
[SPEAKER_15]: I think now's a good time to take a break.

2110
02:26:04,318 --> 02:26:05,039
[SPEAKER_15]: Can we just take a break?

2111
02:26:05,805 --> 02:26:06,666
[SPEAKER_15]: We did the FUs of the week.

2112
02:26:06,946 --> 02:26:07,807
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh yeah, I must have been caught.

2113
02:26:08,107 --> 02:26:09,248
[SPEAKER_15]: It just feels like a break.

2114
02:26:10,369 --> 02:26:14,111
[SPEAKER_15]: This break I'm going to play .59 again, but I'm going to play a special remix of it.

2115
02:26:14,432 --> 02:26:16,713
[SPEAKER_15]: Because a lot of people have been requesting this in chat rooms.

2116
02:26:16,754 --> 02:26:19,295
[SPEAKER_15]: So, this is a really good remix of .59 too.

2117
02:26:19,396 --> 02:26:25,740
[SPEAKER_15]: So, to celebrate episode 59, which is what we're in right now, here's .59, the piano version, a Naoki remix.

2118
02:26:26,941 --> 02:26:27,102
[SPEAKER_15]: Enjoy!

2119
02:26:27,122 --> 02:26:27,442
[SPEAKER_15]: Enjoy!

2120
02:29:41,549 --> 02:29:42,150
Thanks for watching!

2121
02:31:10,649 --> 02:31:14,793
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's listen in on an Orange Lounge Radio staff meeting.

2122
02:31:15,033 --> 02:31:16,735
[SPEAKER_07]: Do we want to be accepted by Hollywood?

2123
02:31:16,775 --> 02:31:17,155
[SPEAKER_07]: No!

2124
02:31:17,255 --> 02:31:20,939
[SPEAKER_07]: Do we care what people think of us?

2125
02:31:21,539 --> 02:31:23,401
[SPEAKER_07]: No!

2126
02:31:23,421 --> 02:31:24,842
[SPEAKER_07]: Do we want people to kiss our ass?

2127
02:31:25,303 --> 02:31:27,945
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes!

2128
02:31:29,406 --> 02:31:34,211
[SPEAKER_04]: Extreme Bomani Radio, that's us, Orange Lounge Radio.

2129
02:31:37,021 --> 02:31:39,662
[SPEAKER_15]: Shark Skrull is waving goodbye to all of you on the camera right now.

2130
02:31:39,942 --> 02:31:41,363
[SPEAKER_15]: And then Loki is putting up some bacon.

2131
02:31:41,903 --> 02:31:44,584
[SPEAKER_15]: Any final thoughts from you since you're leaving?

2132
02:31:48,345 --> 02:31:49,066
[SPEAKER_18]: Tip your waiter.

2133
02:31:50,526 --> 02:31:50,966
[SPEAKER_15]: Very nice.

2134
02:31:51,467 --> 02:31:53,307
[SPEAKER_02]: Have a safe drive.

2135
02:31:53,407 --> 02:31:54,168
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for coming.

2136
02:31:55,468 --> 02:31:57,329
[SPEAKER_15]: Tell everyone in the bay we said hello.

2137
02:31:58,249 --> 02:31:59,330
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm stealing another piece of bacon.

2138
02:32:00,310 --> 02:32:02,491
[SPEAKER_18]: That's another F you to rob for stealing Loki's bacon.

2139
02:32:04,164 --> 02:32:04,945
[SPEAKER_15]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com

2140
02:32:25,325 --> 02:32:28,847
[SPEAKER_15]: Jamie's playing with the webcam, so you might see some interesting things on the cam for the next little bit.

2141
02:32:30,108 --> 02:32:34,291
[SPEAKER_15]: If you don't know our cam's address, go to our chat room, www.callybomani.com.

2142
02:32:34,311 --> 02:32:35,551
[SPEAKER_15]: Click on Orange Lounge and click on Chat.

2143
02:32:36,952 --> 02:32:37,453
[SPEAKER_18]: P.S.

2144
02:32:37,633 --> 02:32:38,673
[SPEAKER_15]: Visit the forums while you're there.

2145
02:32:38,693 --> 02:32:40,094
[SPEAKER_18]: Sharks Girl has left the building.

2146
02:32:41,175 --> 02:32:43,736
[SPEAKER_18]: Bye, Sharks Girl.

2147
02:32:43,796 --> 02:32:44,997
[SPEAKER_18]: Good all.

2148
02:32:45,017 --> 02:32:46,418
[SPEAKER_18]: We're good enough.

2149
02:32:46,598 --> 02:32:47,699
[SPEAKER_15]: Tell Mel we said hi, too.

2150
02:32:48,119 --> 02:32:48,860
[SPEAKER_15]: Too bad he couldn't be here.

2151
02:32:49,420 --> 02:32:50,741
[SPEAKER_18]: He was stuck working.

2152
02:32:51,576 --> 02:32:51,776
[SPEAKER_18]: So, um...

2153
02:33:20,899 --> 02:33:22,160
[SPEAKER_15]: I was at Virgin Megastore this week.

2154
02:33:24,842 --> 02:33:25,863
[SPEAKER_15]: No, I'm not a virgin.

2155
02:33:26,243 --> 02:33:27,184
[SPEAKER_15]: Sharks girl, weren't you leaving?

2156
02:33:27,204 --> 02:33:27,644
[SPEAKER_15]: No, I'm kidding.

2157
02:33:28,325 --> 02:33:28,665
[SPEAKER_15]: I love you.

2158
02:33:30,819 --> 02:33:33,921
[SPEAKER_15]: I went to a Virgin Megastore this week and I was doing some shopping and I picked this up.

2159
02:33:33,961 --> 02:33:34,602
[SPEAKER_15]: This is pretty cool.

2160
02:33:34,702 --> 02:33:37,343
[SPEAKER_15]: I picked up the single for Drifting Away.

2161
02:33:37,984 --> 02:33:40,045
[SPEAKER_15]: Lang featuring Sky with Drifting Away, the single.

2162
02:33:40,105 --> 02:33:41,005
[SPEAKER_15]: Here, I'll put this up on cam.

2163
02:33:41,086 --> 02:33:43,547
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, I can't put it up on cam for another 50 seconds when it refreshes.

2164
02:33:44,287 --> 02:33:48,290
[SPEAKER_15]: It's an interesting little background picture, just a little sunset.

2165
02:33:48,770 --> 02:33:49,711
[SPEAKER_15]: It has four tracks.

2166
02:33:49,731 --> 02:33:52,072
[SPEAKER_15]: It has the radio edit, which you're probably all familiar with.

2167
02:33:52,092 --> 02:33:53,193
[SPEAKER_15]: The original 12-inch mix.

2168
02:33:54,011 --> 02:33:58,985
[SPEAKER_15]: A Beam vs. Cyrus remix with Sucks Balls and the Lang Sunset Dove, which is okay.

2169
02:33:59,446 --> 02:34:02,654
[SPEAKER_15]: But I thought it was kind of neat to walk into the store and it was like, ooh, a Bomani single!

2170
02:34:05,180 --> 02:34:07,501
[SPEAKER_15]: Because I didn't think this song had actually been released in the U.S.

2171
02:34:08,121 --> 02:34:09,621
[SPEAKER_15]: So that was kind of a pleasant surprise.

2172
02:34:10,201 --> 02:34:10,401
[SPEAKER_15]: What?

2173
02:34:10,421 --> 02:34:11,722
[SPEAKER_19]: Are you sure that's not an import?

2174
02:34:12,242 --> 02:34:12,902
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't think so.

2175
02:34:12,922 --> 02:34:15,123
[SPEAKER_15]: It didn't have the little import sticker on it.

2176
02:34:15,243 --> 02:34:19,904
[SPEAKER_15]: And you know what's cool is it's put out by Radical Records, who did that Time After Time CD, if I remember right.

2177
02:34:20,224 --> 02:34:20,444
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes?

2178
02:34:21,364 --> 02:34:21,844
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm not sure.

2179
02:34:21,924 --> 02:34:24,305
[SPEAKER_15]: Anyway, I'll put this up on the cam so you guys can see what the CD looks like.

2180
02:34:25,245 --> 02:34:29,506
[SPEAKER_15]: So I picked up... I don't believe this is an import, but... Who knows?

2181
02:34:31,107 --> 02:34:31,207
[SPEAKER_15]: Um...

2182
02:34:35,166 --> 02:34:36,147
[SPEAKER_15]: I think I got it blurry.

2183
02:34:36,207 --> 02:34:37,107
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh well, forget it.

2184
02:34:38,027 --> 02:34:38,888
[SPEAKER_15]: I can't hold my hand still.

2185
02:34:38,908 --> 02:34:39,368
[SPEAKER_15]: You have to deal.

2186
02:34:39,888 --> 02:34:40,649
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, deal with it.

2187
02:34:42,650 --> 02:34:44,570
[SPEAKER_15]: So that's on the cam if you want to see what that looks like.

2188
02:34:45,331 --> 02:34:45,431
[SPEAKER_15]: It's 9.02.

2189
02:34:45,811 --> 02:34:47,092
[SPEAKER_15]: Wow.

2190
02:34:47,652 --> 02:34:49,173
[SPEAKER_15]: I know we're cruising through the show here.

2191
02:34:49,233 --> 02:34:50,513
[SPEAKER_15]: Is there anything you wanted to bring up?

2192
02:34:51,514 --> 02:34:51,754
[SPEAKER_21]: No.

2193
02:34:52,894 --> 02:34:54,235
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, I guess we do Ask Orange Lounge.

2194
02:34:54,315 --> 02:34:55,075
[SPEAKER_21]: You can see it clearly.

2195
02:34:55,355 --> 02:34:56,756
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, you can see it clearly enough on the cam.

2196
02:34:58,457 --> 02:35:01,238
[SPEAKER_15]: If you want to Ask Orange Lounge a question... Actually, I want to bring up something.

2197
02:35:02,038 --> 02:35:02,659
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, well...

2198
02:35:03,823 --> 02:35:06,404
[SPEAKER_15]: I have a new forum for people who are into gaming of all kinds

2199
02:35:30,712 --> 02:35:33,974
[SPEAKER_21]: It's at roleplay.darksakura.com.

2200
02:35:34,634 --> 02:35:35,075
[SPEAKER_21]: Sign up.

2201
02:35:35,775 --> 02:35:39,778
[SPEAKER_21]: I run, basically, there's going to be freeform games run there.

2202
02:35:39,798 --> 02:35:47,444
[SPEAKER_21]: If you want to run a game using the message board system, send me a private message, and I'll get your game set up, get you set up as moderator.

2203
02:35:48,364 --> 02:35:49,665
[SPEAKER_21]: for your forum, for your group.

2204
02:35:50,125 --> 02:35:50,785
[SPEAKER_21]: We'll get you set up.

2205
02:35:51,245 --> 02:35:55,467
[SPEAKER_21]: Also, we have different game discussions, different types of games.

2206
02:35:55,527 --> 02:35:59,088
[SPEAKER_21]: So if there's a game that you want to have an open discussion on, let me know.

2207
02:35:59,108 --> 02:36:00,788
[SPEAKER_21]: Just sign up for your account and we'll set you up.

2208
02:36:02,589 --> 02:36:03,289
[SPEAKER_21]: It's that easy.

2209
02:36:07,811 --> 02:36:12,232
[SPEAKER_15]: Also, since you brought up Tuesday's show, let's give a plug for all our spinoff shows.

2210
02:36:12,312 --> 02:36:13,773
[SPEAKER_21]: I didn't say what time my show is.

2211
02:36:14,750 --> 02:36:18,632
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, well, Tuesday, well, I'll start with, I should start with Monday, yes?

2212
02:36:19,292 --> 02:36:20,233
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, you just want to go first.

2213
02:36:20,613 --> 02:36:21,133
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, I know.

2214
02:36:21,653 --> 02:36:35,340
[SPEAKER_15]: Monday nights is Vanilla Sky, and, um, it originally was going to have a rotating panel, I was going to have different people in here every week, but, um, Brad and Irene have worked out so well that they're just here, pretty much the perma-co-hosts on Vanilla Sky, where we talk about, um,

2215
02:36:37,336 --> 02:36:41,779
[SPEAKER_15]: We talk about everything, kind of like, we talk about other game stuff, and then we talk about things outside of that.

2216
02:36:41,799 --> 02:36:46,983
[SPEAKER_15]: We talk about what's going on in the real world, also, outside of your computer, from a nerdy point of view, definitely.

2217
02:36:47,443 --> 02:36:51,947
[SPEAKER_15]: And we do such crazy antics as, I guess, the Yahoo Talkback, because people on Yahoo are stupid.

2218
02:36:52,407 --> 02:36:55,489
[SPEAKER_15]: And we do, of course, bad music and video game trivia.

2219
02:36:57,170 --> 02:36:59,152
[SPEAKER_15]: Have you listened to bad music and video game trivia yet, Jamie?

2220
02:37:00,083 --> 02:37:01,324
[SPEAKER_19]: Um, no.

2221
02:37:01,484 --> 02:37:02,045
[SPEAKER_15]: It's exciting.

2222
02:37:02,305 --> 02:37:04,367
[SPEAKER_15]: What I do is I give video game trivia.

2223
02:37:04,407 --> 02:37:07,049
[SPEAKER_15]: I question Brad and Irene on a certain topic.

2224
02:37:07,089 --> 02:37:08,430
[SPEAKER_15]: Like last week it was racing games.

2225
02:37:08,450 --> 02:37:09,371
[SPEAKER_15]: It was a topic.

2226
02:37:09,391 --> 02:37:10,451
[SPEAKER_15]: I quizzed them on racing games.

2227
02:37:10,872 --> 02:37:15,475
[SPEAKER_15]: And for every question they get wrong, we bring up the volume of some bad music.

2228
02:37:15,536 --> 02:37:17,197
[SPEAKER_15]: Like last week was Barbra Streisand music.

2229
02:37:18,498 --> 02:37:19,619
[SPEAKER_19]: Barbra Streisand's cool.

2230
02:37:20,119 --> 02:37:25,624
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, you know, everybody, no matter what I pick, somebody always goes, but I like that person.

2231
02:37:25,644 --> 02:37:27,745
[SPEAKER_15]: The first week it was Enya, then it was Celine Dion.

2232
02:37:28,466 --> 02:37:29,327
[SPEAKER_21]: Celine Dion, yeah.

2233
02:37:30,370 --> 02:37:33,111
[SPEAKER_21]: So Leon has only done one good song and it was Meatloaf.

2234
02:37:34,731 --> 02:37:36,592
[SPEAKER_15]: And we talk a lot about Puzzle Pirates too.

2235
02:37:36,652 --> 02:37:38,693
[SPEAKER_15]: It's kind of turning into a Puzzle Pirates show almost.

2236
02:37:38,713 --> 02:37:40,293
[SPEAKER_21]: You don't play Ragnarok with me anymore.

2237
02:37:40,553 --> 02:37:42,314
[SPEAKER_15]: It's because I didn't renew my account.

2238
02:37:42,374 --> 02:37:44,834
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm waiting for that other thing.

2239
02:37:45,035 --> 02:37:46,615
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, renew for another month and play with me.

2240
02:37:46,695 --> 02:37:49,116
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm waiting for the Dyslexic Rollo fan club to open up.

2241
02:37:51,136 --> 02:37:51,496
[SPEAKER_15]: That's all.

2242
02:37:52,097 --> 02:37:53,017
[SPEAKER_21]: Renew your account and play with me.

2243
02:37:53,607 --> 02:37:54,228
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll think about it.

2244
02:37:54,968 --> 02:37:56,049
[SPEAKER_15]: But I like Puzzle Pirates a lot.

2245
02:37:56,389 --> 02:37:59,151
[SPEAKER_15]: So, that's it.

2246
02:37:59,191 --> 02:38:00,772
[SPEAKER_15]: That's what you can look for on my show.

2247
02:38:02,254 --> 02:38:03,354
[SPEAKER_21]: My show is Tuesday.

2248
02:38:03,575 --> 02:38:05,896
[SPEAKER_21]: It's basically, it's all requests.

2249
02:38:06,096 --> 02:38:09,919
[SPEAKER_21]: It's called Pump Up the Volume because I'm a big 80s nerd fan.

2250
02:38:12,441 --> 02:38:19,106
[SPEAKER_21]: So, it starts at 7.30, although I have a 7 o'clock pre-show because I usually just have that on while I go to the bathroom.

2251
02:38:20,067 --> 02:38:21,228
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, did I say that on the air?

2252
02:38:21,428 --> 02:38:21,788
[SPEAKER_21]: My bad.

2253
02:38:23,493 --> 02:38:28,675
[SPEAKER_21]: But no, it starts at 7.30 unless you want to catch the pre-show beforehand.

2254
02:38:29,135 --> 02:38:32,536
[SPEAKER_21]: I play requests, so I hardly talk so you don't have to listen to my crappy voice.

2255
02:38:33,877 --> 02:38:36,338
[SPEAKER_21]: I sometimes talk, you know, discuss things.

2256
02:38:36,398 --> 02:38:39,279
[SPEAKER_21]: I'd like to have a guest, but no one ever wants to come hang out with me on Tuesday.

2257
02:38:39,539 --> 02:38:41,400
[SPEAKER_15]: I'd come some week, but you have me on this show.

2258
02:38:41,760 --> 02:38:42,720
[SPEAKER_15]: You have me on this show.

2259
02:38:43,020 --> 02:38:43,961
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, I don't need you anymore.

2260
02:38:43,981 --> 02:38:51,003
[SPEAKER_15]: You need to get some other... You have other... You need to get Shark Skull or... I don't know.

2261
02:38:51,123 --> 02:38:52,244
[SPEAKER_21]: I'll try to arrange a guest.

2262
02:38:52,304 --> 02:38:52,744
[SPEAKER_15]: Get Dan.

2263
02:38:53,895 --> 02:38:54,975
[SPEAKER_21]: Dan's working Tuesday nights.

2264
02:38:54,995 --> 02:38:56,355
[SPEAKER_21]: That's why I do the show Tuesday.

2265
02:38:57,816 --> 02:39:05,537
[SPEAKER_21]: But if you're in our chat room, then you can send me a private message that night, and I will play anything that you want, if I have it, or something by the same group.

2266
02:39:06,077 --> 02:39:08,918
[SPEAKER_15]: Unless you request, like, Spice Girls.

2267
02:39:09,078 --> 02:39:12,118
[SPEAKER_21]: I played Vitamin C. Vitamin C's cool, though.

2268
02:39:12,859 --> 02:39:20,160
[SPEAKER_21]: But there's just, like, very few things that are on my I Will Not playlist, and usually that's, like, a couple of songs.

2269
02:39:21,630 --> 02:39:22,551
[SPEAKER_21]: I want to hear Dirty.

2270
02:39:23,491 --> 02:39:23,992
[SPEAKER_21]: And Dirty.

2271
02:39:24,092 --> 02:39:25,553
[SPEAKER_21]: That won't be played on my show.

2272
02:39:25,793 --> 02:39:26,494
[SPEAKER_21]: That song sucks.

2273
02:39:27,795 --> 02:39:32,638
[SPEAKER_15]: By the way, I just have to say, at the Depot last night, I saw the video of that.

2274
02:39:32,919 --> 02:39:36,081
[SPEAKER_15]: They played the video of the MTV Video Music Awards, that whole little thing.

2275
02:39:36,361 --> 02:39:36,882
[SPEAKER_02]: The smoochie?

2276
02:39:36,922 --> 02:39:37,382
[SPEAKER_15]: Fabulous.

2277
02:39:37,422 --> 02:39:39,464
[SPEAKER_15]: And you should have seen all the, you know, because it's a gay bar.

2278
02:39:39,724 --> 02:39:41,305
[SPEAKER_15]: You should have seen all the gay guys' reactions to that.

2279
02:39:41,325 --> 02:39:41,965
[SPEAKER_15]: It was great.

2280
02:39:42,005 --> 02:39:43,747
[SPEAKER_15]: We were just all calling.

2281
02:39:43,927 --> 02:39:44,407
[SPEAKER_15]: It was great.

2282
02:39:44,427 --> 02:39:44,808
[SPEAKER_15]: It was fun.

2283
02:39:45,728 --> 02:39:45,988
[SPEAKER_15]: Anyway.

2284
02:39:46,829 --> 02:39:47,950
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah.

2285
02:39:48,010 --> 02:39:48,310
[SPEAKER_21]: Sorry.

2286
02:39:48,510 --> 02:39:48,851
[SPEAKER_21]: It's okay.

2287
02:39:48,871 --> 02:39:49,351
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry to interrupt.

2288
02:39:50,280 --> 02:40:02,449
[SPEAKER_21]: Um, but, uh, it lasts until, uh, 10.30, and then that's usually the point where I have to wait another 30 minutes for the Ragnarok server to come back on so I can play more Ragnarok, like the addict I am.

2289
02:40:03,570 --> 02:40:04,971
[SPEAKER_21]: And, it's, it's fun.

2290
02:40:05,572 --> 02:40:10,455
[SPEAKER_15]: I, I figured that's, I figured that's why you did your show Tuesday night, because that was RO maintenance night.

2291
02:40:11,076 --> 02:40:16,500
[SPEAKER_21]: This, this Tuesday, though, um, I was going to be doing video game music trivia again, um, and

2292
02:40:17,583 --> 02:40:21,404
[SPEAKER_21]: But I won't be able to do it because I'm going to be talking as little as possible.

2293
02:40:22,644 --> 02:40:24,485
[SPEAKER_21]: You know, trying to let my lungs recover.

2294
02:40:24,505 --> 02:40:32,986
[SPEAKER_15]: Which is different than the video game music trivia I'm doing because she's literally video game music trivia.

2295
02:40:33,606 --> 02:40:35,987
[SPEAKER_21]: And I have like multiple question style.

2296
02:40:37,607 --> 02:40:44,289
[SPEAKER_21]: So, you know, if you guess what it's from, what level it's from, give me as much as you know about this music, you'll get a point for it.

2297
02:40:45,009 --> 02:40:45,249
[SPEAKER_15]: Cool.

2298
02:40:45,916 --> 02:40:47,498
[SPEAKER_21]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2299
02:41:05,678 --> 02:41:07,399
[SPEAKER_15]: Zero didn't make it last week, so I don't know.

2300
02:41:07,439 --> 02:41:08,079
[SPEAKER_15]: He's got another week.

2301
02:41:08,099 --> 02:41:09,100
[SPEAKER_21]: Thursday show, Bacon Man.

2302
02:41:09,280 --> 02:41:11,822
[SPEAKER_15]: Otherwise, we may be looking for something else to put on Wednesdays.

2303
02:41:12,542 --> 02:41:16,084
[SPEAKER_15]: Sorry, but if he misses two weeks in a row, I'm just... My show's fun.

2304
02:41:16,544 --> 02:41:19,066
[SPEAKER_15]: If he misses two weeks in a row, I'm just going to assume he doesn't want to do it.

2305
02:41:20,106 --> 02:41:22,187
[SPEAKER_20]: And Wednesday night, more pummeling on you.

2306
02:41:23,268 --> 02:41:24,849
[SPEAKER_15]: We'll think of something creative for Wednesday.

2307
02:41:25,249 --> 02:41:27,230
[SPEAKER_15]: I do have a backup show that's ready to go.

2308
02:41:27,470 --> 02:41:28,611
[SPEAKER_15]: Not a live show, though.

2309
02:41:29,972 --> 02:41:30,312
[SPEAKER_15]: We'll see.

2310
02:41:33,587 --> 02:41:39,409
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, my show, LiveWire, every Thursday, 7 o'clock, hour-long pre-show.

2311
02:41:42,610 --> 02:41:47,732
[SPEAKER_15]: Usually, I've been doing now like the show before, you know, kind of replaying the show previous to it.

2312
02:41:49,637 --> 02:41:59,720
[SPEAKER_15]: And this week on LiveWire, we're going to be doing kind of like a non-stop of every single LiveWire so far, all five shows, because it's my birthday and I'm not going to be here to do this.

2313
02:42:00,421 --> 02:42:04,742
[SPEAKER_15]: So I'm going to have them all remixed together.

2314
02:42:04,802 --> 02:42:09,644
[SPEAKER_15]: Basically, I'm just going to redo every set without my voice on it and mix together better.

2315
02:42:09,804 --> 02:42:09,984
[SPEAKER_15]: So...

2316
02:42:11,384 --> 02:42:14,166
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, have those and you'll get to hear them non-stop.

2317
02:42:14,186 --> 02:42:19,408
[SPEAKER_15]: And at the very end, there'll be something special for you listeners who stay tuned.

2318
02:42:20,289 --> 02:42:23,771
[SPEAKER_15]: It was going to be a new Loki remix, but I played that tonight.

2319
02:42:24,191 --> 02:42:25,352
[SPEAKER_15]: He blew his wad.

2320
02:42:25,852 --> 02:42:27,032
[SPEAKER_15]: No, it might be another one.

2321
02:42:27,092 --> 02:42:27,453
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know.

2322
02:42:27,513 --> 02:42:29,494
[SPEAKER_15]: We'll see.

2323
02:42:30,494 --> 02:42:38,739
[SPEAKER_15]: I would like to see a strung together mix of all... Dark's Baka in the chat room.

2324
02:42:38,799 --> 02:42:39,359
[SPEAKER_15]: Hey, Baka.

2325
02:42:40,399 --> 02:42:42,340
[SPEAKER_15]: DarkSakura has a show Tuesday night.

2326
02:42:42,380 --> 02:42:43,721
[SPEAKER_15]: That's what she was just talking about.

2327
02:42:43,801 --> 02:42:44,021
[SPEAKER_15]: Anyway.

2328
02:42:47,042 --> 02:42:48,443
[SPEAKER_15]: Thursday nights, live wire, yes.

2329
02:42:49,183 --> 02:42:57,248
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, so we got a little something special at the end there for those who tune in for the long, long set of music that's going to be there.

2330
02:42:57,348 --> 02:43:01,470
[SPEAKER_15]: And also remember, because it's going to start off, I'm starting the show earlier this week, it's going to be at 6.

2331
02:43:03,189 --> 02:43:03,629
[SPEAKER_15]: DarkSakura.com

2332
02:43:25,938 --> 02:43:31,882
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, Livewire, the motion picture score, you know, like, kind of like a score type music.

2333
02:43:31,962 --> 02:43:36,345
[SPEAKER_15]: And then last week's, which was Fuck the R.I.A., which was... That was beautiful.

2334
02:43:36,425 --> 02:43:42,069
[SPEAKER_15]: It was independent, um, indie artists versus commercial artists, and it was pretty sweet.

2335
02:43:43,450 --> 02:43:43,971
[SPEAKER_15]: Very cool.

2336
02:43:44,351 --> 02:43:48,634
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, I, Livewire is such a great show, it's getting me into mixing, even.

2337
02:43:48,714 --> 02:43:51,896
[SPEAKER_15]: And I did a mega mix that I played after Vanilla Sky one week, and, uh...

2338
02:43:52,917 --> 02:44:00,283
[SPEAKER_15]: If I do it more regularly, I might find some spare time on the station to air him on a Saturday afternoon or something, but who knows.

2339
02:44:03,165 --> 02:44:06,127
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't want to take any thunder away from Loki, but he's way better at it than I am.

2340
02:44:06,327 --> 02:44:07,908
[SPEAKER_15]: He can do it on the fly better than I can.

2341
02:44:09,494 --> 02:44:16,138
[SPEAKER_15]: And I really do, literally on the fly, because the last few weeks I've been really slacking on getting my show together.

2342
02:44:16,258 --> 02:44:20,281
[SPEAKER_15]: And I literally, I'm working on the show until like the last three seconds.

2343
02:44:21,461 --> 02:44:22,202
[SPEAKER_15]: Literally, so.

2344
02:44:22,882 --> 02:44:26,745
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright, so Orange Lounge Radio, live programming every Sunday through Thursday night.

2345
02:44:26,985 --> 02:44:29,566
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, Wednesdays are questionable recently, but we'll see.

2346
02:44:29,867 --> 02:44:30,847
[SPEAKER_15]: We're going to work on that.

2347
02:44:31,267 --> 02:44:34,610
[SPEAKER_15]: Anyway, as promised, you guys can ask us questions now.

2348
02:44:34,670 --> 02:44:36,691
[SPEAKER_15]: It's Ask Orange Lounge.

2349
02:44:36,751 --> 02:44:38,312
[SPEAKER_15]: So if you want to ask us a question...

2350
02:44:39,443 --> 02:44:46,088
[SPEAKER_15]: Head on to our chat room, www.callybomani.com Click on Orange Lounge and click on chat.

2351
02:44:46,148 --> 02:44:50,032
[SPEAKER_15]: And you can ask myself, Loki, or Jamie any question you want.

2352
02:44:50,532 --> 02:44:56,837
[SPEAKER_15]: It's one of our favorite segments to do on this show, especially when we're desperate for filler material, which is often.

2353
02:44:57,598 --> 02:45:00,280
[SPEAKER_15]: Especially in a slow Bomani News Week as it has been lately.

2354
02:45:02,802 --> 02:45:04,903
[SPEAKER_15]: What day of the week is Max 2 supposed to come out?

2355
02:45:04,963 --> 02:45:06,064
[SPEAKER_15]: It's the 24th, right?

2356
02:45:06,144 --> 02:45:06,785
[SPEAKER_15]: That's a Wednesday.

2357
02:45:08,689 --> 02:45:13,413
[SPEAKER_15]: We might be doing something, um, we'll have to do something the day that Max 2 comes out, just to add that in there.

2358
02:45:13,473 --> 02:45:17,497
[SPEAKER_15]: Anyway, let's talk about Orange Lounge, or ask Orange Lounge.

2359
02:45:24,303 --> 02:45:27,286
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's ask Orange Lounge some stupid question.

2360
02:45:28,007 --> 02:45:31,390
[SPEAKER_15]: Who will get yelled at this week on Orange Lounge, asks the same man.

2361
02:45:35,430 --> 02:45:36,171
[SPEAKER_15]: I like cheese.

2362
02:45:36,411 --> 02:45:37,031
[SPEAKER_15]: I like milk.

2363
02:45:37,732 --> 02:45:38,472
[SPEAKER_15]: They give me gas.

2364
02:45:38,612 --> 02:45:38,992
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

2365
02:45:39,993 --> 02:45:41,294
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm going to do something, by the way.

2366
02:45:41,674 --> 02:45:41,894
[SPEAKER_15]: What?

2367
02:45:43,135 --> 02:45:44,256
[SPEAKER_21]: That I haven't done in a year.

2368
02:45:44,276 --> 02:45:46,237
[SPEAKER_15]: You're going to eat bacon?

2369
02:45:46,257 --> 02:45:46,637
[SPEAKER_21]: Two years.

2370
02:45:48,078 --> 02:45:48,879
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm going to eat bacon.

2371
02:45:49,819 --> 02:45:50,980
[SPEAKER_15]: His bacon is yummy.

2372
02:45:55,143 --> 02:45:59,265
[SPEAKER_19]: Now I know why I don't eat pork anymore.

2373
02:46:00,886 --> 02:46:02,027
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm just hungry and sick.

2374
02:46:07,611 --> 02:46:08,251
[SPEAKER_15]: First question.

2375
02:46:08,271 --> 02:46:09,112
[SPEAKER_19]: He tastes like murder.

2376
02:46:10,533 --> 02:46:11,614
[SPEAKER_15]: EvilNaoki2DX.

2377
02:46:11,954 --> 02:46:12,054
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh.

2378
02:46:12,995 --> 02:46:14,095
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a shameless plug.

2379
02:46:14,156 --> 02:46:15,276
[SPEAKER_15]: It's not an ask question.

2380
02:46:15,296 --> 02:46:16,417
[SPEAKER_15]: It's just a shameless plug.

2381
02:46:16,457 --> 02:46:16,857
[SPEAKER_15]: Here it is.

2382
02:46:18,378 --> 02:46:23,282
[SPEAKER_15]: Japan Town Anime Fair is this weekend at San Francisco's Japan Town.

2383
02:46:23,342 --> 02:46:26,224
[SPEAKER_15]: It's at the Radisson Miyako Hotel.

2384
02:46:26,264 --> 02:46:27,465
[SPEAKER_15]: I probably... Miyako.

2385
02:46:27,505 --> 02:46:28,345
[SPEAKER_15]: Sorry, I'm white.

2386
02:46:28,946 --> 02:46:30,687
[SPEAKER_15]: And the Best Western Miyako Inn.

2387
02:46:31,861 --> 02:46:34,662
[SPEAKER_15]: Only $12 for the weekend or $8 for one day.

2388
02:46:34,682 --> 02:46:35,582
[SPEAKER_15]: You want more info?

2389
02:46:35,903 --> 02:46:40,204
[SPEAKER_15]: www.jtaf.com for more info.

2390
02:46:40,584 --> 02:46:41,865
[SPEAKER_21]: Let me know if you need me to work.

2391
02:46:42,985 --> 02:46:43,325
[SPEAKER_21]: I will.

2392
02:46:43,425 --> 02:46:44,126
[SPEAKER_21]: I'll cosplay there.

2393
02:46:44,706 --> 02:46:44,966
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

2394
02:46:45,086 --> 02:46:48,607
[SPEAKER_21]: In my bike and costume.

2395
02:46:48,768 --> 02:46:49,328
[SPEAKER_15]: 23rd Magus.

2396
02:46:49,528 --> 02:46:55,090
[SPEAKER_15]: Loki, how would you go about setting an initial D machine on fire?

2397
02:46:55,270 --> 02:46:56,671
[SPEAKER_15]: I need help on my technique.

2398
02:46:58,771 --> 02:46:59,171
[SPEAKER_15]: Gas.

2399
02:47:00,192 --> 02:47:00,472
[SPEAKER_15]: Fire.

2400
02:47:00,492 --> 02:47:00,572
[SPEAKER_15]: Fire.

2401
02:47:01,408 --> 02:47:09,673
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't need to eat any more bacon, I think my mouth is catching SARS or something I'm gonna have some more V8, here, hold this

2402
02:47:32,307 --> 02:47:33,648
[SPEAKER_16]: So gasoline and a match.

2403
02:47:34,149 --> 02:47:34,369
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.

2404
02:47:34,629 --> 02:47:36,911
[SPEAKER_16]: That would be my advice, too.

2405
02:47:37,432 --> 02:47:40,795
[SPEAKER_16]: Late at night when no one's working, you have to excuse me, I have a mouth full of bacon.

2406
02:47:41,195 --> 02:47:49,902
[SPEAKER_15]: Or if you want, what you should do is pour gas over the circuitry and then leave it, you know, so when they turn it on and the game boots up, then it catches on fire and blows up.

2407
02:47:51,944 --> 02:47:52,525
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, fine.

2408
02:47:57,169 --> 02:47:57,649
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

2409
02:47:57,709 --> 02:47:58,310
[SPEAKER_15]: Better than that.

2410
02:47:59,019 --> 02:48:03,161
[SPEAKER_15]: Just go in the little cabinet where you sit in to play the game and take a dump.

2411
02:48:04,102 --> 02:48:05,863
[SPEAKER_15]: It's worse than setting the machine on fire.

2412
02:48:06,483 --> 02:48:08,924
[SPEAKER_21]: They need that blue napalm stuff that we had when we went camping.

2413
02:48:09,605 --> 02:48:10,645
[SPEAKER_21]: Because that stuff is cool.

2414
02:48:14,307 --> 02:48:20,891
[SPEAKER_15]: Jason, our friend Jason, would like to know, he says, although I can't hear the answer, why?

2415
02:48:21,031 --> 02:48:21,851
[SPEAKER_15]: Why aren't you listening?

2416
02:48:21,951 --> 02:48:22,172
[SPEAKER_15]: Why?

2417
02:48:22,232 --> 02:48:22,932
[SPEAKER_15]: What is wrong with you?

2418
02:48:24,373 --> 02:48:28,435
[SPEAKER_15]: He'd like to ask Orange Lounge, why does this weekend feel so angsty like?

2419
02:48:29,744 --> 02:48:31,144
[SPEAKER_15]: Baka says, I love Orange Lounge

2420
02:49:00,394 --> 02:49:01,315
[SPEAKER_15]: Aw, how nice.

2421
02:49:01,335 --> 02:49:02,476
[SPEAKER_15]: There was no question there, though.

2422
02:49:02,956 --> 02:49:03,597
[SPEAKER_15]: What did you get?

2423
02:49:04,357 --> 02:49:05,478
[SPEAKER_15]: What were you talking about?

2424
02:49:05,538 --> 02:49:06,459
[SPEAKER_15]: Hey, what did you get?

2425
02:49:06,499 --> 02:49:07,219
[SPEAKER_15]: He, he, silly me.

2426
02:49:07,539 --> 02:49:10,302
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm getting all these little bits and pieces of a message here.

2427
02:49:11,162 --> 02:49:11,863
[SPEAKER_15]: No question, though.

2428
02:49:16,306 --> 02:49:17,727
[SPEAKER_15]: So we'll move on to DCB.

2429
02:49:17,787 --> 02:49:18,307
[SPEAKER_15]: Hi, guys.

2430
02:49:20,589 --> 02:49:21,830
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, this is interesting.

2431
02:49:22,250 --> 02:49:24,632
[SPEAKER_15]: DCB wants to know every cast member's opinion on this.

2432
02:49:24,712 --> 02:49:28,415
[SPEAKER_15]: Who is outright cooler, Al Roker or Bob Saget?

2433
02:49:29,663 --> 02:49:32,244
[SPEAKER_15]: and which one would you rather have live at your house?

2434
02:49:32,484 --> 02:49:32,784
[SPEAKER_15]: Loki.

2435
02:49:33,824 --> 02:49:36,265
[SPEAKER_15]: Al Roker is the weather guy on the Today Show.

2436
02:49:36,305 --> 02:49:37,045
[SPEAKER_15]: It's going to rain.

2437
02:49:38,406 --> 02:49:39,626
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't watch TV, thank you.

2438
02:49:40,306 --> 02:49:43,807
[SPEAKER_15]: Al Roker had his stomach stapled and now he looks really thin.

2439
02:49:43,907 --> 02:49:44,787
[SPEAKER_15]: It's kind of scary.

2440
02:49:45,328 --> 02:49:56,771
[SPEAKER_15]: But Bob's saying it's cool because, one, he played a stoner in Half-Baked and, two, he played this guy in Dumb and Dumberer who said,

2441
02:49:57,617 --> 02:49:59,238
[SPEAKER_15]: He's shit all over my bathroom.

2442
02:49:59,438 --> 02:50:00,659
[SPEAKER_15]: There's shit everywhere.

2443
02:50:00,879 --> 02:50:02,039
[SPEAKER_15]: There's shit on the mirror.

2444
02:50:02,239 --> 02:50:02,880
[SPEAKER_15]: There's shit here.

2445
02:50:02,980 --> 02:50:03,540
[SPEAKER_15]: It was awesome.

2446
02:50:04,881 --> 02:50:13,765
[SPEAKER_15]: I would also have to say that as much as I love Al Roker, Bob Saget is cooler because, yeah, I used to suck dick for coke.

2447
02:50:18,047 --> 02:50:19,808
[SPEAKER_15]: Who would I rather have live at the house, though?

2448
02:50:20,268 --> 02:50:20,689
[SPEAKER_15]: Al Roker.

2449
02:50:20,729 --> 02:50:22,109
[SPEAKER_15]: I would rather have Al Roker live at the house.

2450
02:50:22,610 --> 02:50:22,810
[SPEAKER_15]: Why?

2451
02:50:22,870 --> 02:50:24,370
[SPEAKER_15]: Bob Saget used to clean up everything.

2452
02:50:25,531 --> 02:50:27,232
[SPEAKER_15]: But Al Roker can predict the weather.

2453
02:50:28,032 --> 02:50:29,253
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, right, uh-huh.

2454
02:50:29,914 --> 02:50:31,395
[SPEAKER_15]: Like, he can predict his diet.

2455
02:50:31,755 --> 02:50:35,999
[SPEAKER_21]: You know what, it doesn't matter which one's chosen, because the moment they step foot in my house legally, I can shoot them.

2456
02:50:39,903 --> 02:50:48,130
[SPEAKER_15]: Did you hear, now, did you hear about this, Jamie, about this news story about the guy who tried to rob the bank, and he had an explosive collar around his neck?

2457
02:50:48,510 --> 02:50:49,912
[SPEAKER_21]: I know, that was cool!

2458
02:50:50,752 --> 02:50:54,733
[SPEAKER_15]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

2459
02:51:22,390 --> 02:51:26,051
[SPEAKER_15]: Maple speaks and is asking us a question.

2460
02:51:26,772 --> 02:51:27,192
[SPEAKER_15]: Gasp.

2461
02:51:27,532 --> 02:51:29,893
[SPEAKER_15]: First, he wants to know, how do I go about listening?

2462
02:51:31,633 --> 02:51:32,754
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, it's easy.

2463
02:51:32,914 --> 02:51:33,974
[SPEAKER_15]: You know what?

2464
02:51:34,054 --> 02:51:35,735
[SPEAKER_15]: If you're here, you're obviously listening.

2465
02:51:36,435 --> 02:51:42,197
[SPEAKER_15]: But in case you forget, you can always go to, and I'll send this over private message to Maple, just in case he really isn't listening.

2466
02:51:42,477 --> 02:51:43,498
[SPEAKER_15]: You can go to our website.

2467
02:51:43,558 --> 02:51:44,678
[SPEAKER_15]: It's at orangelounge.com.

2468
02:51:47,563 --> 02:51:51,125
[SPEAKER_15]: DarkSakura.Sky.CX, but not for much longer.

2469
02:51:51,205 --> 02:51:52,666
[SPEAKER_15]: Hopefully only one more week on that.

2470
02:51:52,926 --> 02:51:53,187
[SPEAKER_15]: Right?

2471
02:51:53,827 --> 02:51:54,327
[SPEAKER_15]: Right, kids?

2472
02:51:55,268 --> 02:51:57,089
[SPEAKER_15]: Hey, someone was supposed to be working on that website.

2473
02:51:57,109 --> 02:51:58,170
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, well, it didn't happen.

2474
02:51:59,931 --> 02:52:01,152
[SPEAKER_15]: I was too busy sucking debt for Coke.

2475
02:52:02,272 --> 02:52:03,073
[SPEAKER_15]: You're a Coke head.

2476
02:52:03,093 --> 02:52:05,595
[SPEAKER_15]: See, I told you that it looks like a drug mark.

2477
02:52:05,615 --> 02:52:06,155
[SPEAKER_15]: Diet Coke!

2478
02:52:06,555 --> 02:52:10,738
[SPEAKER_15]: Anyway, Mabel would also like to know, why am I so cool?

2479
02:52:12,715 --> 02:52:15,657
[SPEAKER_15]: He ate a nasty piece of the bacon.

2480
02:52:15,717 --> 02:52:18,639
[SPEAKER_15]: Loki choked on bacon when I asked that question.

2481
02:52:18,679 --> 02:52:20,180
[SPEAKER_15]: No, it wasn't a choke on bacon.

2482
02:52:20,220 --> 02:52:22,622
[SPEAKER_15]: It was a piece of the seasoning stuff I got.

2483
02:52:22,642 --> 02:52:25,003
[SPEAKER_15]: And there was like nice crunchy charcoal-y taste.

2484
02:52:25,764 --> 02:52:28,846
[SPEAKER_15]: I was like, oh, it's nasty bacon.

2485
02:52:28,866 --> 02:52:31,547
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, water.

2486
02:52:32,188 --> 02:52:33,308
[SPEAKER_15]: Loki's got that nasty bacon.

2487
02:52:33,669 --> 02:52:35,190
[SPEAKER_15]: Mabel wants to know why he's so cool.

2488
02:52:37,691 --> 02:52:40,113
[SPEAKER_21]: If you got the ice cubes out of your pants, maybe you wouldn't be.

2489
02:52:42,884 --> 02:52:43,685
[SPEAKER_15]: I like that answer.

2490
02:52:45,005 --> 02:52:45,826
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm done with the bacon.

2491
02:52:46,006 --> 02:52:46,866
[SPEAKER_15]: Bacon is done.

2492
02:52:47,687 --> 02:52:50,829
[SPEAKER_15]: Maple's cool because he's really laid back.

2493
02:52:50,929 --> 02:52:51,909
[SPEAKER_15]: He's a laid back guy.

2494
02:52:52,510 --> 02:52:52,950
[SPEAKER_15]: I like that.

2495
02:52:57,653 --> 02:52:57,933
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright.

2496
02:53:00,895 --> 02:53:01,315
[SPEAKER_15]: Moving on.

2497
02:53:01,375 --> 02:53:07,819
[SPEAKER_15]: John Fields would like to know, little kids that run across the DDR pads, what would you do to them if you didn't get in trouble for it?

2498
02:53:09,900 --> 02:53:10,260
[SPEAKER_21]: Trip them.

2499
02:53:10,301 --> 02:53:10,921
[SPEAKER_21]: I do all the time.

2500
02:53:14,636 --> 02:53:18,179
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, I would, um, push them down a flight of stairs.

2501
02:53:18,739 --> 02:53:30,666
[SPEAKER_15]: I would hang them by hooks through their skin on their back, and then I'd pour hot oil on their back, and then after they kept screaming, I'd stick sharp needles through their chin and through the sides of their cheeks, and then through their chest.

2502
02:53:32,227 --> 02:53:33,368
[SPEAKER_15]: No, tell us how you really feel.

2503
02:53:34,228 --> 02:53:37,190
[SPEAKER_15]: Of course, I was taken from, uh, Ichi the Killer, awesome movie.

2504
02:53:40,792 --> 02:53:41,833
[SPEAKER_15]: Then I'd cut off their nipples.

2505
02:53:43,684 --> 02:53:44,364
[SPEAKER_15]: and Baka.

2506
02:53:45,264 --> 02:53:46,965
[SPEAKER_15]: Baka would like to admit he is random.

2507
02:53:47,485 --> 02:53:48,125
[SPEAKER_15]: We figured that out.

2508
02:53:49,726 --> 02:53:53,527
[SPEAKER_15]: Baka would also like us to define its definition time.

2509
02:53:54,367 --> 02:53:55,607
[SPEAKER_15]: Define angst.

2510
02:53:59,188 --> 02:53:59,528
[SPEAKER_21]: Alright.

2511
02:54:00,068 --> 02:54:00,929
[SPEAKER_21]: Do this, Rob.

2512
02:54:02,269 --> 02:54:03,529
[SPEAKER_21]: Go pull up Internet Explorer.

2513
02:54:06,270 --> 02:54:09,231
[SPEAKER_21]: Type in www.dictionary.com

2514
02:54:12,992 --> 02:54:14,113
[SPEAKER_21]: Type in the word angst.

2515
02:54:17,876 --> 02:54:19,137
[SPEAKER_21]: Angst, by definition.

2516
02:54:19,797 --> 02:54:23,860
[SPEAKER_21]: A feeling of anxiety or apprehension often accompanied by depression.

2517
02:54:25,021 --> 02:54:26,262
[SPEAKER_21]: That's what angst means.

2518
02:54:26,442 --> 02:54:27,323
[SPEAKER_21]: And now you know.

2519
02:54:27,743 --> 02:54:29,044
[SPEAKER_21]: And knowing is half the battle.

2520
02:54:29,204 --> 02:54:29,744
[SPEAKER_21]: Go Joe.

2521
02:54:31,426 --> 02:54:33,107
[SPEAKER_15]: Now this, well here's the second part.

2522
02:54:35,248 --> 02:54:36,749
[SPEAKER_15]: Define Fahud Lagas.

2523
02:54:39,491 --> 02:54:41,413
[SPEAKER_21]: That's the sound you make after I kick your ass.

2524
02:54:45,856 --> 02:54:48,677
[SPEAKER_15]: That's the sound of Jamie's leg going right at your balls.

2525
02:54:53,998 --> 02:54:55,719
[SPEAKER_15]: That's my Japanese porn star name.

2526
02:54:58,339 --> 02:54:59,600
[SPEAKER_15]: My Japanese porn star name.

2527
02:55:01,120 --> 02:55:04,561
[SPEAKER_15]: See, you don't know it's me because I'm all mosaicked out, but that's me.

2528
02:55:06,722 --> 02:55:07,522
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm a stunt cock.

2529
02:55:09,762 --> 02:55:10,723
[SPEAKER_15]: We're out of questions.

2530
02:55:12,983 --> 02:55:15,204
[SPEAKER_15]: Does anybody in the room have a question for somebody else?

2531
02:55:17,867 --> 02:55:22,750
[SPEAKER_21]: Dear Chatroom, why do I own you so much for free?

2532
02:55:24,230 --> 02:55:29,113
[SPEAKER_15]: Dear Chatroom, I look at my PayPal account every day and there's no other money in there.

2533
02:55:29,313 --> 02:55:30,734
[SPEAKER_15]: Why isn't anyone giving me money?

2534
02:55:32,955 --> 02:55:36,917
[SPEAKER_15]: NightmareHunter underscore, or Nightmare underscore Hunter.

2535
02:55:37,097 --> 02:55:38,898
[SPEAKER_12]: Why won't any of you let me pimp you out?

2536
02:55:39,459 --> 02:55:40,319
[SPEAKER_12]: We got questions.

2537
02:55:40,579 --> 02:55:41,040
[SPEAKER_15]: We're saved.

2538
02:55:41,660 --> 02:55:41,940
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

2539
02:55:43,761 --> 02:55:47,183
[SPEAKER_15]: Maple would like to know, only who can prevent forest fires?

2540
02:55:49,725 --> 02:55:50,206
[SPEAKER_21]: Not me.

2541
02:55:50,646 --> 02:55:51,487
[SPEAKER_21]: Shit, I start them.

2542
02:55:54,189 --> 02:55:59,074
[SPEAKER_15]: Actually, I actually used to live, or I kind of live, we kind of live in the middle of a forest, right?

2543
02:55:59,474 --> 02:56:02,657
[SPEAKER_15]: And there was that fire just two blocks down the street a couple weeks ago.

2544
02:56:02,997 --> 02:56:06,200
[SPEAKER_15]: So the fire department can prevent forest fires from consuming your home.

2545
02:56:06,220 --> 02:56:10,344
[SPEAKER_15]: Because if they hadn't acted so fast, we could have been dead.

2546
02:56:10,624 --> 02:56:11,305
[SPEAKER_15]: No, we were at work.

2547
02:56:11,345 --> 02:56:15,869
[SPEAKER_15]: If a bear tried to prevent forest fires, he would just get consumed in the flames and die.

2548
02:56:16,787 --> 02:56:18,549
[SPEAKER_21]: Only God can prevent forest fires.

2549
02:56:19,190 --> 02:56:20,151
[SPEAKER_21]: Start praying, children.

2550
02:56:22,313 --> 02:56:23,954
[SPEAKER_15]: All of a sudden, this is a religious show.

2551
02:56:24,435 --> 02:56:27,958
[SPEAKER_15]: I know Live365 had a lot of religious stations, but shit.

2552
02:56:28,359 --> 02:56:36,807
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, we need to do that thing where we go on to other Live365 stations, like the Christian Rock channels and things like that, and make fun of them.

2553
02:56:36,927 --> 02:56:38,189
[SPEAKER_15]: Listen to them and make fun of them.

2554
02:56:38,909 --> 02:56:39,550
[SPEAKER_15]: Maybe another time.

2555
02:56:42,116 --> 02:56:43,317
[SPEAKER_15]: I can do that.

2556
02:56:43,837 --> 02:56:47,059
[SPEAKER_15]: DCB would like to know, why do women have boobs?

2557
02:56:49,640 --> 02:56:50,821
[SPEAKER_15]: He has an answer, though, too.

2558
02:56:51,261 --> 02:56:53,462
[SPEAKER_15]: So you have something to look at when you're talking to them.

2559
02:56:55,063 --> 02:56:55,543
[SPEAKER_15]: Family guy.

2560
02:57:01,967 --> 02:57:03,988
[SPEAKER_17]: If you could see Jamie's face.

2561
02:57:04,628 --> 02:57:05,849
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm trying not to laugh.

2562
02:57:10,432 --> 02:57:10,572
[SPEAKER_21]: See...

2563
02:57:12,561 --> 02:57:14,603
[SPEAKER_21]: We have cushioning where you guys have targets.

2564
02:57:18,005 --> 02:57:18,526
[SPEAKER_21]: Think about it.

2565
02:57:22,088 --> 02:57:23,830
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't... Why do women have boobs?

2566
02:57:23,990 --> 02:57:25,731
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, obviously the breast milk's there.

2567
02:57:27,352 --> 02:57:30,014
[SPEAKER_15]: But they don't have to be, you know, so big some of the times.

2568
02:57:30,074 --> 02:57:31,675
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, babies don't drink that much.

2569
02:57:34,798 --> 02:57:35,538
[SPEAKER_21]: Estrogen!

2570
02:57:35,598 --> 02:57:36,059
[SPEAKER_21]: Hello?

2571
02:57:36,079 --> 02:57:36,199
[SPEAKER_21]: Hello?

2572
02:57:37,655 --> 02:57:38,455
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, but still.

2573
02:57:38,495 --> 02:57:41,497
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm talking like Jerry Springer boobs.

2574
02:57:41,517 --> 02:57:42,677
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, but why do people get the boobs off?

2575
02:57:42,697 --> 02:57:45,258
[SPEAKER_15]: What I don't understand is my nuts aren't that big, so I mean.

2576
02:57:45,419 --> 02:57:46,019
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, that's true.

2577
02:57:46,039 --> 02:57:48,120
[SPEAKER_15]: Why can't my nuts be as big as women's boobs?

2578
02:57:48,140 --> 02:57:50,021
[SPEAKER_15]: Because that would really hurt.

2579
02:57:52,021 --> 02:57:56,403
[SPEAKER_21]: Having boobs does not hurt unless you have really big boobs and then your back hurts all the time.

2580
02:57:57,644 --> 02:58:00,805
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, I'm not even going to get started on that one.

2581
02:58:02,266 --> 02:58:04,427
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, I know I have big boobs.

2582
02:58:06,505 --> 02:58:07,366
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm... You have nice boobs.

2583
02:58:07,526 --> 02:58:08,387
[SPEAKER_15]: You have nice boobs.

2584
02:58:08,427 --> 02:58:09,929
[SPEAKER_21]: Don't look at my boobs.

2585
02:58:11,390 --> 02:58:11,770
[SPEAKER_15]: It's okay.

2586
02:58:11,810 --> 02:58:13,572
[SPEAKER_15]: He's, you know, gay, so... Okay.

2587
02:58:13,712 --> 02:58:13,912
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

2588
02:58:13,972 --> 02:58:14,733
[SPEAKER_15]: But... Ah!

2589
02:58:15,574 --> 02:58:17,456
[SPEAKER_21]: No, you have a boob fixation.

2590
02:58:19,298 --> 02:58:19,518
[SPEAKER_21]: But...

2591
02:58:21,926 --> 02:58:29,609
[SPEAKER_21]: I would say that when you get into the double D's, there were these women at my elementary school.

2592
02:58:29,669 --> 02:58:34,031
[SPEAKER_21]: I was so afraid of them because they had boobs that were as big as me when I was five.

2593
02:58:35,652 --> 02:58:42,075
[SPEAKER_21]: And that's the time to go save up your money and go get a boob job because that's too heavy.

2594
02:58:42,375 --> 02:58:47,017
[SPEAKER_15]: When you have boobs large enough to hold Matrix babies in them, that's when you have to be concerned.

2595
02:58:47,437 --> 02:58:49,057
[SPEAKER_21]: Actually, I'm not kidding.

2596
02:58:49,438 --> 02:58:50,198
[SPEAKER_21]: They were that large.

2597
02:58:50,805 --> 02:58:58,790
[SPEAKER_21]: The triple, like, the ones that get, like, the triple G or... I didn't get, like, when I watched Geraldo one day, these women were, like, expanding themselves as novelty models.

2598
02:58:59,771 --> 02:59:03,133
[SPEAKER_15]: What the hell's the point of a, you know, why don't they, like, add, like, squirrel... To G size.

2599
02:59:03,373 --> 02:59:05,655
[SPEAKER_15]: Squirrel tails or something like that, you know, something funny.

2600
02:59:07,496 --> 02:59:08,077
[SPEAKER_15]: Claws.

2601
02:59:10,158 --> 02:59:20,065
[SPEAKER_21]: And the people with small boobs who, you know, want big boobs, you know what, be happy with what you have, because having big boobs isn't everything, except you get a lot more dates.

2602
02:59:23,519 --> 02:59:25,521
[SPEAKER_15]: What is the best racist joke you know of?

2603
02:59:25,601 --> 02:59:27,223
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll tell a Helen Keller joke.

2604
02:59:27,243 --> 02:59:28,103
[SPEAKER_15]: Those are funny.

2605
02:59:28,123 --> 02:59:29,605
[SPEAKER_15]: How do Helen Keller's parents punish her?

2606
02:59:44,451 --> 02:59:45,732
[SPEAKER_15]: by rearranging the furniture.

2607
02:59:48,474 --> 02:59:50,095
[SPEAKER_15]: It's funny because she's blind.

2608
02:59:52,096 --> 02:59:53,977
[SPEAKER_15]: That's not really racist, but you know.

2609
02:59:56,419 --> 02:59:57,299
[SPEAKER_15]: A deaf joke, okay.

2610
02:59:58,000 --> 02:59:59,741
[SPEAKER_21]: Of course I learned this joke from a deaf person.

2611
03:00:01,342 --> 03:00:11,068
[SPEAKER_21]: Three people were, there was a big conference and a deaf guy was sitting with an American guy and there was a Russian guy and a Mexican guy.

2612
03:00:12,634 --> 03:00:13,215
[SPEAKER_21]: No, I'm not saying that.

2613
03:00:13,235 --> 03:00:13,695
[SPEAKER_21]: Cuban guy.

2614
03:00:14,856 --> 03:00:17,218
[SPEAKER_21]: And Cuban guy stands up and walks over to a window.

2615
03:00:17,298 --> 03:00:19,580
[SPEAKER_21]: He takes a puff of a cigar and throws it out the window.

2616
03:00:20,641 --> 03:00:24,024
[SPEAKER_21]: And the deaf guy signs to him, you know, why did you throw the cigar out the window?

2617
03:00:24,044 --> 03:00:24,744
[SPEAKER_21]: He's like, oh, it's pretty.

2618
03:00:24,824 --> 03:00:26,806
[SPEAKER_21]: Cigars in Cuba, you know, hey, Cuban cigars.

2619
03:00:27,406 --> 03:00:31,370
[SPEAKER_21]: So the deaf guy just sits back and, you know, goes along with watching the conference, you know.

2620
03:00:31,890 --> 03:00:36,174
[SPEAKER_21]: And then the Russian guy gets up and takes a big swig of vodka and throws a bottle out the window.

2621
03:00:36,674 --> 03:00:38,275
[SPEAKER_21]: He's like, well, why did you throw the vodka out the window?

2622
03:00:38,296 --> 03:00:39,857
[SPEAKER_21]: It's pretty vodka in Russia, you know.

2623
03:00:40,825 --> 03:00:41,666
[SPEAKER_21]: Russia, Vodka.

2624
03:00:42,206 --> 03:00:44,048
[SPEAKER_21]: So, deaf guy's sitting there, he's thinking.

2625
03:00:44,709 --> 03:00:48,472
[SPEAKER_21]: So he goes up and opens the window, picks up the American guy and throws him out the window.

2626
03:00:48,873 --> 03:00:49,714
[SPEAKER_21]: He's like, where'd you do that?

2627
03:00:49,994 --> 03:00:51,235
[SPEAKER_21]: Plenty of hearing people in America.

2628
03:00:54,438 --> 03:00:55,099
[SPEAKER_15]: I have a gay joke.

2629
03:00:56,540 --> 03:00:58,062
[SPEAKER_15]: How do you make a gay guy scream twice?

2630
03:00:59,503 --> 03:01:01,785
[SPEAKER_15]: Fuck him in the ass and then wipe your cock on the curtains.

2631
03:01:06,580 --> 03:01:14,163
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, Mabel would also like to know, um, when you were talking about big boobs, were you making fun of me being fat?

2632
03:01:14,904 --> 03:01:18,085
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know how he gets fat out of that, but... Yes.

2633
03:01:18,645 --> 03:01:20,206
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, we were.

2634
03:01:21,607 --> 03:01:22,747
[SPEAKER_15]: Do your boobs produce milk?

2635
03:01:23,047 --> 03:01:24,628
[SPEAKER_15]: Do you drink a lot of breast milk?

2636
03:01:25,008 --> 03:01:25,528
[SPEAKER_15]: Do you go move?

2637
03:01:25,548 --> 03:01:28,429
[SPEAKER_21]: You know they have lactation pads that you can put in your bra now.

2638
03:01:28,490 --> 03:01:29,210
[SPEAKER_21]: We should get you some.

2639
03:01:30,350 --> 03:01:31,671
[SPEAKER_21]: Now that's making fun, see?

2640
03:01:32,589 --> 03:01:34,910
[SPEAKER_15]: Why are people so, you know... Why are people self-conscious?

2641
03:01:35,530 --> 03:01:36,051
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know.

2642
03:01:36,431 --> 03:01:37,651
[SPEAKER_15]: It's like you have your own creamer.

2643
03:01:37,972 --> 03:01:38,592
[SPEAKER_15]: It's awesome.

2644
03:01:38,632 --> 03:01:41,673
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, you know, I would be self-conscious.

2645
03:01:41,973 --> 03:01:42,254
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay.

2646
03:01:43,014 --> 03:01:46,716
[SPEAKER_21]: First of all, if you've never... That's the other reason why I'm not having children.

2647
03:01:48,657 --> 03:01:57,721
[SPEAKER_21]: I can't even find... After sitting for 30 minutes listening to my stepsister telling me about what it feels like to lactate, no children for me, thank you.

2648
03:01:59,645 --> 03:02:01,206
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll come back to Mabel's last question a little bit.

2649
03:02:01,386 --> 03:02:03,727
[SPEAKER_15]: Nince would like to say, not a question, but a comment.

2650
03:02:04,788 --> 03:02:08,490
[SPEAKER_15]: If only God can prevent forest fires, well, then they'll always start.

2651
03:02:10,531 --> 03:02:11,691
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

2652
03:02:11,831 --> 03:02:12,472
[SPEAKER_15]: You da funny.

2653
03:02:15,713 --> 03:02:20,856
[SPEAKER_15]: Rice Princess is asking when we're going to update the damn website, because she doesn't want to plug it if it's not updated.

2654
03:02:22,277 --> 03:02:27,940
[SPEAKER_15]: We've made steps to get a new website constructed, but it's just coming along slowly.

2655
03:02:27,960 --> 03:02:28,660
[SPEAKER_15]: Of course.

2656
03:02:31,009 --> 03:02:32,770
[SPEAKER_15]: We need to have it done soon, though.

2657
03:02:32,890 --> 03:02:33,390
[SPEAKER_15]: I know we do.

2658
03:02:33,470 --> 03:02:34,331
[SPEAKER_15]: So hopefully this week.

2659
03:02:34,351 --> 03:02:41,196
[SPEAKER_15]: I feel like an alien is going to pop out of my stomach.

2660
03:02:41,216 --> 03:02:44,178
[SPEAKER_15]: You're going to be okay, though, right?

2661
03:02:44,658 --> 03:02:46,579
[SPEAKER_15]: See, I'm immune to the pork and grease.

2662
03:02:47,660 --> 03:02:51,723
[SPEAKER_15]: John Fields says, Should Weird Al do a parody of a Linkin Park song?

2663
03:02:51,783 --> 03:02:52,143
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

2664
03:02:52,443 --> 03:02:52,663
[SPEAKER_15]: No.

2665
03:02:53,344 --> 03:02:53,744
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

2666
03:02:54,144 --> 03:02:54,425
[SPEAKER_15]: Has he?

2667
03:02:54,505 --> 03:02:54,705
[SPEAKER_15]: What?

2668

[SPEAKER_15]: Angry White Boy Polka.

2669
03:02:56,266 --> 03:02:56,986
[SPEAKER_15]: Is Linkin Park in there?

2670
03:02:57,166 --> 03:02:57,467
[SPEAKER_15]: Might be.

2671
03:02:57,767 --> 03:02:57,887
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

2672
03:02:59,813 --> 03:03:02,774
[SPEAKER_15]: Gur would like to know, why is it so hard to get rid of hiccups?

2673
03:03:04,315 --> 03:03:04,635
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know.

2674
03:03:04,655 --> 03:03:06,036
[SPEAKER_15]: Why is it so hard to get rid of Mexicans?

2675
03:03:12,519 --> 03:03:16,061
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you for answering two questions and one there with Naples joke as well.

2676
03:03:16,101 --> 03:03:16,661
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

2677
03:03:18,282 --> 03:03:22,264
[SPEAKER_15]: I just thought I'd like to address the other comment there.

2678
03:03:23,104 --> 03:03:23,464
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know.

2679
03:03:24,445 --> 03:03:25,405
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm not really racist.

2680
03:03:25,445 --> 03:03:27,126
[SPEAKER_15]: I just play one on the radio.

2681
03:03:31,849 --> 03:03:32,209
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

2682
03:03:32,829 --> 03:03:33,930
[SPEAKER_15]: Maple's last question.

2683
03:03:34,010 --> 03:03:36,171
[SPEAKER_15]: Why aren't you accepting any more questions?

2684
03:03:36,931 --> 03:03:38,471
[SPEAKER_15]: Because, kids, it's the end of the show.

2685
03:03:40,332 --> 03:03:42,873
[SPEAKER_15]: And Ask Orange Lounge is now finished.

2686
03:03:42,993 --> 03:03:44,714
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, but Rice Princess, I'm not racist.

2687
03:03:44,834 --> 03:03:46,414
[SPEAKER_15]: I hate everyone equally, see?

2688
03:03:48,875 --> 03:03:51,696
[SPEAKER_15]: Ask Orange Lounge is now over and done.

2689
03:03:52,316 --> 03:03:53,857
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's not shoot a dead horse.

2690
03:03:54,017 --> 03:03:55,597
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's get on to the next segment.

2691
03:03:56,098 --> 03:03:57,218
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm going to puke from the pork.

2692
03:03:57,658 --> 03:03:58,899
[SPEAKER_15]: The pork is really nasty.

2693
03:03:59,719 --> 03:04:00,059
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

2694
03:04:03,950 --> 03:04:05,111
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, final thoughts?

2695
03:04:06,652 --> 03:04:06,913
[SPEAKER_15]: Loki.

2696
03:04:08,053 --> 03:04:09,555
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank God the pork is gone.

2697
03:04:09,775 --> 03:04:11,876
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm not eating any more bacon for a while.

2698
03:04:14,698 --> 03:04:17,981
[SPEAKER_15]: My final thought is, um, I hate Walmart.

2699
03:04:18,021 --> 03:04:19,282
[SPEAKER_15]: No, I'm not going to get over it.

2700
03:04:21,904 --> 03:04:23,625
[SPEAKER_21]: Now I remember why I gave up pork.

2701
03:04:24,935 --> 03:04:29,377
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm also very sad because I just spent $340 on arcade buttons.

2702
03:04:30,817 --> 03:04:31,418
[SPEAKER_15]: That is sad.

2703
03:04:32,778 --> 03:04:33,859
[SPEAKER_15]: Final word of the show.

2704
03:04:35,279 --> 03:04:36,299
[SPEAKER_15]: I ought to take it myself.

2705
03:04:36,680 --> 03:04:37,400
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll give it to Jamie.

2706
03:04:37,420 --> 03:04:38,901
[SPEAKER_15]: I know she always likes to have the final word.

2707
03:04:38,941 --> 03:04:39,241
[SPEAKER_15]: Here it is.

2708
03:04:42,902 --> 03:04:47,344
[SPEAKER_21]: The final word of the evening is puce.

2709
03:04:49,029 --> 03:04:51,432
[SPEAKER_15]: You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

2710

[SPEAKER_15]: Orange Lounge Radio is hosted by Dark Sakura, Sky, and Loki.

03:04:56,178 --> 03:04:58,040
[SPEAKER_16]: We expect you a nice play again.

03:04:58,520 --> 03:05:01,284
[SPEAKER_16]: And now, here's your fortune cookie message of the day.

2713

[SPEAKER_13]: Thanks for listening and we'll see you next week.

2718
03:07:33,792 --> 03:07:34,573
[SPEAKER_16]: I like this song.

2719
03:07:38,175 --> 03:07:39,856
[SPEAKER_15]: This reminds me of Ferris Bueller's Day Off.

2720
03:07:39,876 --> 03:07:43,498
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, that's why DCB sent this song to me, because it reminds him of Ferris Bueller's Day Off.

2721
03:07:44,779 --> 03:07:46,079
[SPEAKER_15]: That movie is so cool.

2722
03:07:46,119 --> 03:07:48,461
[SPEAKER_15]: Anyway, yes, hi, welcome to the Orange Lounge Radio Afterbirth.

2723
03:07:51,772 --> 03:07:54,654
[SPEAKER_15]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2724
03:08:11,269 --> 03:08:15,671
[SPEAKER_15]: We went to Walmart and bought Trivial Pursuit, the 20th anniversary edition, and brought it home and played.

2725
03:08:15,711 --> 03:08:19,313
[SPEAKER_15]: It was me, Brad, Irene, Loki, and Nellie, Loki's girlfriend.

2726
03:08:19,713 --> 03:08:20,273
[SPEAKER_15]: We were all playing.

2727
03:08:20,674 --> 03:08:21,874
[SPEAKER_15]: And hilarity.

2728
03:08:22,034 --> 03:08:23,155
[SPEAKER_15]: It was absolutely hilarious.

2729
03:08:23,215 --> 03:08:25,016
[SPEAKER_15]: We got some of the most funniest answers ever.

2730
03:08:25,456 --> 03:08:27,077
[SPEAKER_15]: Like, I was asking Nellie a question.

2731
03:08:27,117 --> 03:08:29,298
[SPEAKER_15]: I was trying to get everybody's attention because everybody was talking.

2732
03:08:29,318 --> 03:08:30,919
[SPEAKER_15]: I wanted to ask a question, so I went, which?

2733
03:08:31,539 --> 03:08:32,740
[SPEAKER_15]: And I was like, which?

2734
03:08:32,940 --> 03:08:37,442
[SPEAKER_15]: Like, I was starting the question, which one of the... And Irene's all, don't call her a witch.

2735
03:08:39,025 --> 03:08:39,945
[SPEAKER_15]: This is funny, he had to be there.

2736
03:08:40,505 --> 03:08:43,606
[SPEAKER_15]: And then we learned that there is a cat exhibit at the local aquarium.

2737
03:08:44,746 --> 03:08:48,627
[SPEAKER_15]: And we also learned that Stephen King directed E.T.

2738
03:08:50,628 --> 03:08:52,588
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm going to get punched in the face for that one, but that's okay.

2739
03:08:56,429 --> 03:08:57,489
[SPEAKER_15]: I gotta fuck you, Rob.

2740
03:08:59,349 --> 03:09:00,230
[SPEAKER_15]: I gotta fuck you.

2741
03:09:02,650 --> 03:09:03,250
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm sorry, what?

2742
03:09:03,670 --> 03:09:04,111
[SPEAKER_15]: What, Jamie?

2743
03:09:04,431 --> 03:09:06,071
[SPEAKER_15]: Jamie has clean clothes, she's celebrating.

2744
03:09:06,437 --> 03:09:09,859
[SPEAKER_15]: I can smell clean clothes because the fans blow and the clean clothes smell this way.

2745
03:09:10,620 --> 03:09:12,061
[SPEAKER_15]: Smells like clean clotheness.

2746
03:09:18,025 --> 03:09:20,487
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you all for listening to and supporting Orange Lounge Radio.

2747
03:09:20,527 --> 03:09:21,348
[SPEAKER_15]: We do appreciate it.

2748
03:09:21,548 --> 03:09:22,508
[SPEAKER_15]: It's very nice of you.

2749
03:09:27,152 --> 03:09:29,053
[SPEAKER_15]: I think we're pretty much done.

2750
03:09:29,073 --> 03:09:30,534
[SPEAKER_15]: Jamie, do you have anything you want to say?

2751
03:09:32,295 --> 03:09:33,196
[SPEAKER_15]: Get your ass over here.

2752
03:09:37,378 --> 03:09:40,141
[SPEAKER_21]: Who needs potpourri when you can have clean laundry?

2753
03:09:40,161 --> 03:09:51,755
[SPEAKER_15]: Sprinkle detergent all over your house.

2754
03:09:57,757 --> 03:09:59,598
[SPEAKER_15]: No, you want to know get away the clean clothes?

2755
03:09:59,838 --> 03:10:05,520
[SPEAKER_15]: Or not really clean clothes, but give it... Give the impression of clean clothes?

2756
03:10:05,920 --> 03:10:07,380
[SPEAKER_15]: Rubber dryer sheet on yourself.

2757
03:10:09,281 --> 03:10:10,241
[SPEAKER_15]: That's so ghetto.

2758
03:10:10,541 --> 03:10:17,524
[SPEAKER_15]: That's like something you'd hear on... That's like something you'd... Do you smell my butt?

2759
03:10:17,564 --> 03:10:18,644
[SPEAKER_15]: Rob just smelled my butt.

2760
03:10:18,704 --> 03:10:19,584
[SPEAKER_15]: I smelled your butt.

2761
03:10:20,285 --> 03:10:21,605
[SPEAKER_21]: It smells April fresh.

2762
03:10:26,027 --> 03:10:26,747
[SPEAKER_15]: That was beautiful.

2763
03:10:32,617 --> 03:10:35,038
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, sex, blood, violence, and bloodshed.

2764
03:10:35,778 --> 03:10:46,200
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, there's this movie, Ichi the Killer, where this guy beats up this prostitute and they cut off her nipples, as I mentioned earlier, and there's lots of blood from that.

2765
03:10:46,621 --> 03:10:49,421
[SPEAKER_15]: So that has sex, violence, and bloodshed.

2766
03:10:49,441 --> 03:10:50,822
[SPEAKER_15]: What a lovely thought, thank you.

2767
03:10:51,862 --> 03:10:52,562
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a great movie, though.

2768
03:10:55,300 --> 03:10:57,101
[SPEAKER_15]: Everything with the same prostitute.

2769
03:10:58,422 --> 03:10:59,563
[SPEAKER_15]: Or different prostitute, actually.

2770
03:10:59,943 --> 03:11:02,065
[SPEAKER_15]: Gets her leg cut off and she's hobbling on one foot.

2771
03:11:03,185 --> 03:11:03,445
[SPEAKER_16]: Funny.

2772
03:11:05,207 --> 03:11:05,427
[SPEAKER_16]: Funny.

2773
03:11:09,970 --> 03:11:10,270
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

2774
03:11:12,051 --> 03:11:12,691
[SPEAKER_15]: I think we're done.

2775
03:11:13,672 --> 03:11:14,933
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll be nicer when you're smarter.

2776
03:11:15,802 --> 03:11:16,402
[SPEAKER_15]: Good night, everybody.

2777
03:11:16,422 --> 03:11:18,023
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you for supporting Orange Lounge Radio.

2778
03:11:18,063 --> 03:11:18,803
[SPEAKER_15]: We appreciate it.

2779
03:11:19,023 --> 03:11:22,785
[SPEAKER_15]: After the show tonight, we have for you guys a Dance Mania marathon.

2780
03:11:22,845 --> 03:11:23,185
[SPEAKER_15]: Yay!

2781
03:11:23,205 --> 03:11:27,207
[SPEAKER_15]: A whole bunch of thrown-together tracks from your favorite Dance Mania albums.

2782
03:11:27,247 --> 03:11:28,127
[SPEAKER_15]: That should be exciting.

2783
03:11:28,147 --> 03:11:30,148
[SPEAKER_15]: There's a whole bunch of albums in here.

2784
03:11:32,269 --> 03:11:33,429
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm sure you guys will enjoy it.

2785
03:11:33,489 --> 03:11:34,230
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, I have to add one more.

2786
03:11:34,250 --> 03:11:35,930
[SPEAKER_15]: I want to make sure EX4 gets in here, too.

2787
03:11:36,030 --> 03:11:39,152
[SPEAKER_15]: So, Loki, say something else while I get this ready.

2788
03:11:40,032 --> 03:11:44,435
[SPEAKER_15]: If you give me money, I will invite you over to play in the arcade cabinet, because it will be sweet.

2789
03:11:44,955 --> 03:11:48,257
[SPEAKER_15]: But no one has given me money except for Vandalus.

2790
03:11:48,297 --> 03:11:50,939
[SPEAKER_15]: And Vandalus, you're more than welcome to come over when I'm done.

2791
03:11:53,180 --> 03:11:53,920
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, but he gave me $10.

2792
03:11:53,980 --> 03:11:59,564
[SPEAKER_15]: That's alright.

2793
03:11:59,664 --> 03:12:01,485
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, you're more than welcome to come over.

2794
03:12:01,545 --> 03:12:03,606
[SPEAKER_15]: You're always... Woo, court!

2795
03:12:03,826 --> 03:12:03,946
[SPEAKER_15]: Ah!

2796
03:12:04,387 --> 03:12:04,747
[SPEAKER_15]: Change.

2797
03:12:06,828 --> 03:12:09,530
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, but she just did laundry here, so that's more like a laundromat.

2798
03:12:10,126 --> 03:12:10,606
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh yeah.

2799
03:12:11,967 --> 03:12:12,648
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

2800
03:12:13,748 --> 03:12:15,329
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm going to use it as a piggy bank also.

2801
03:12:15,589 --> 03:12:16,890
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a $60 piggy bank.

2802
03:12:16,950 --> 03:12:18,671
[SPEAKER_15]: Stupid fucking coin door costs that much.

2803
03:12:22,193 --> 03:12:22,594
[SPEAKER_15]: But, um...

2804
03:12:24,079 --> 03:12:24,960
[SPEAKER_15]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2805
03:12:43,143 --> 03:12:45,284
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, we're going to do a Dance Mania Marathon now.

2806
03:12:45,564 --> 03:12:52,726
[SPEAKER_15]: If you missed any portion of tonight's show, you can always tune in to the Rewinds, which are on Wednesdays at 4 o'clock and Thursdays at 2 o'clock.

2807
03:12:53,226 --> 03:12:57,888
[SPEAKER_15]: Tomorrow night, Vanilla Sky, Tuesday night, pump up the volume, Thursday night, Live Wire, Wednesday night, we'll see.

2808
03:12:59,133 --> 03:12:59,654
[SPEAKER_15]: Bye, guys.

2809
03:12:59,674 --> 03:13:00,274
[SPEAKER_15]: Thanks for listening.

2810
03:13:00,294 --> 03:13:03,437
[SPEAKER_15]: I will fart continuously on the mic on Wednesday night.

2811
03:13:03,817 --> 03:13:10,844
[SPEAKER_15]: Wednesday might just be a... If we can't get Zero to commit to a show, we might just do a live Trivial Pursuit game on air.

2812
03:13:11,384 --> 03:13:12,726
[SPEAKER_15]: I know what we should call the show.

2813
03:13:12,886 --> 03:13:13,106
[SPEAKER_15]: What?

2814
03:13:13,406 --> 03:13:14,988
[SPEAKER_15]: I set myself on fire.

2815
03:13:17,110 --> 03:13:17,490
