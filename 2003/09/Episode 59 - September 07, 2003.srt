1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Don't even get a lousy copy of our home game.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
You're a complete loser!

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Don't know what I was thinking of.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I guess I just wasn't too bright.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Well, I sure hope I do better

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
next weekend on The Price is Right.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Aight, aight.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
I love some Jeopardy, baby.

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I lost on Jeopardy, baby

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I lost on Jeopardy, baby

11
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Rock the cradle of love, rock the cradle of love, yes the cradle of love, don't rock easy

12
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
it's true.

13
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I rock the cradle of love

14
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I rock the cradle of love

15
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Yes, the cradle of love

16
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Don't rock easy, it's true

17
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
The love shack is a little old place where

18
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
We can dance together

19
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Love Shack Baby, Love Shack Baby, Love Shack

20
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Pump up the jam, pump up the jam, pump up the jam, pump it up

21
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Set me in the corner, set me in the spot light

22
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Losing my religion, trying to keep a view

23
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
And I don't know if I can do it

24
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Oh no!

25
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I said too much

26
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I haven't said enough

27
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
The things you say

28
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Your purple bro just gives you away the things you say

29
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
You're unbelievable

30
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Do me baby

31
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Do me baby

32
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
You can do me in the morning

33
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
You can do me in the night

34
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
When you wanna do me

35
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
You're the lady who

36
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Every night

37
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Enter night

38
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Take my hand

39
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Off to Never Never Land

40
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,000
The Humpty Dance is your chance to do the hump

41
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Do me baby

42
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Do the Humpty Humpty, do the Humpty Humpty Do me baby, do the Humpty Humpty Come on and do the Humpty Humpty

43
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:37,000
She's mine, cherry pie Put a smile on your face, ten miles wide It looks so good, make a grown man cry

44
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
The sweet cherry pie, yi, yi

45
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Whoo!

46
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Drum solo!

47
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I miss you much

48
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
M-O-I miss you much

49
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I really miss you much

50
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
M-I-S-S you much

51
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I miss you much

52
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
M-O-I miss you much

53
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I really miss you much

54
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Hey!

55
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I don't want anybody else

56
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
When I think about you I touch myself

57
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I don't want anybody else, oh no, oh no, oh no, no, no!

58
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
He's the one they call Dr. Feelgood!

59
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
He's the one that makes you feel alright!

60
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
He's the one they call Dr. Feelgood!

61
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
He's gonna be your Frankenstein!

62
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Let's kick it!

63
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
If you got a problem, go!

64
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I'll solve it, check out the beat while the DJ revolves it!

65
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Ice Ice Baby!

66
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Ice Ice Baby!

67
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
We're just your mother!

68
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Ice Ice Baby!

69
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Eyes, eyes, baby, forever, I'll be your eyes!

70
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Eyes, eyes, baby, eyes, eyes, baby, eyes, eyes, baby

71
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Hey!

72
00:04:51,000 --> 00:05:16,240
You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio, the Monty Talk and then some.

73
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,840
Mostly the and then some part of that.

74
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:22,840
Orange Lounge Radio is created by a bunch of potty-mouthed adults.

75
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:28,840
Orange Lounge may contain sexual, perverted, and mildly retarded content.

76
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:32,840
You probably shouldn't let your children listen to Orange Lounge Radio.

77
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:34,840
Yes, I will spank your child.

78
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:36,840
If you're not going to do your job, goddammit, I will.

79
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,840
Well, here's to my big opening.

80
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:44,840
A sphincter says what?

81
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:46,840
I'm super. Thanks for asking.

82
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:49,840
Oh, you little bitch troll from hell.

83
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,840
What am I doing here?

84
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,840
No.

85
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:54,840
Dodge this.

86
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:55,840
Mm-hmm.

87
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,840
This is a tasty burger.

88
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,840
Look, you stupid bastard, you've got no arms left.

89
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:00,840
Yes, I have.

90
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:02,840
Look, there's a flesh wound.

91
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:05,840
Searching for a boy in high school is that useless.

92
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:09,840
It's searching for meaning in a polished shoreline.

93
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:10,840
Oh, yeah?

94
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:14,840
Well, I hope your babies look like monkeys.

95
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:15,840
Dark sacra.

96
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:34,840
We are live and this is episode number.59 for September the 7th of 2003.

97
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:39,840
I made a 5-9 joke.

98
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:45,040
You're tuned into the Be Monnie Scene's most glompy radio station of all things Be Monnie.

99
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:48,300
My name is Rob Roberts, and you might know me as Skye.

100
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:52,560
Joining me, as always, are my awesome co-hosts in this corner, the happiest bunny on the

101
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,120
farm, Miss Jamie Sommers.

102
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:56,520
I want a nap.

103
00:06:56,520 --> 00:07:01,320
You know her better as Dark Sakura, or today it's Nappy Sakura.

104
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:03,320
She needs to take a nap.

105
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,320
What?

106
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:05,320
You don't like me.

107
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:06,320
It's Baby Sakura.

108
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:07,320
You bite me.

109
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:08,320
You changed my diaper.

110
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:13,320
I'm going to kick your ass in a moment.

111
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:15,320
I'm gonna kick your ass in a moment.

112
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:17,320
I'll be contagious if you watch.

113
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:19,320
It's Angry Baby Sakura.

114
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:23,320
In that corner, say hello to our tech master, Loki.

115
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:24,320
Hello.

116
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:29,320
Also with us tonight, we have...

117
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:30,320
Air.

118
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:31,320
Nobody.

119
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:32,320
No, we have air.

120
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:33,320
We have air.

121
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,320
We have particles.

122
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:38,320
See, if I'd had that song chewed up, I could have played air and made another funny Bomani

123
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:40,320
joke, like two jokes in 60 seconds.

124
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:47,560
We have germs and and other single-celled organisms. We are not alone and a part of mine in the back of the room and

125
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:54,000
By making those super my jokes in a row you would have qualified for the quota for us to kill you

126
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:58,520
I'm so excited

127
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:04,560
You have the microphone you know what one of them I think

128
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:18,000
We'll have to go on a parrot hunt later.

129
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,560
You're going to hunt to save it and I'm going to hunt to kill it.

130
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:26,000
I'll just make you smell my shoe.

131
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
We'll be back.

132
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,760
We're a little dead tonight so it's going to be an interesting show.

133
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:38,760
the

134
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:43,800
right up

135
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:47,160
the

136
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:48,880
and happy

137
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:51,360
looking for evil

138
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,920
i'm feeling kind of

139
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:59,920
i'm feeling tired too i've done nothing but really now like all week long

140
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:06,240
I love that sound, it makes me go squeak.

141
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:09,240
We'll be back, we have a little bit of reminding news to talk about tonight, it's somewhat

142
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:11,760
exciting and we have other junk to talk about too.

143
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:17,560
I know Dark Sackers got an exciting story and I have boring ones to tell so we'll do

144
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:20,280
some story telling when we come back from break.

145
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:26,760
My pre-show thing there is sort of a hint.

146
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:30,280
An Arcadian, I'm with you right there, I feel you.

147
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:33,380
We'll be back after this appropriate break.

148
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:18,640
So many times with these brains So many people see what's high

149
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:27,640
I'm setting off like the sky Keep it real all the way to the light

150
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:29,040
I'm sure they don't fight in the sky

151
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,440
Keep it real or they'll make it live

152
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:31,940
And I'll party people and survive

153
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:33,540
This is your life, little key gang

154
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:35,140
Look at her, and she ain't with the pain

155
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:37,140
So pump your fists, yeah

156
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:55,140
Come on

157
00:14:55,140 --> 00:14:55,940
Nico, meow

158
00:14:55,940 --> 00:14:56,740
Meow meow

159
00:14:56,740 --> 00:15:00,740
Nico meow Nico meow meow meow

160
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:04,780
This randomness could only be brought to you by orange lounge

161
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:11,020
Hello everybody and welcome back to

162
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:13,220
orange lounge radio

163
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:18,620
and that's that you heard 0.59 appropriate because this is the 59th show of orange launch radio and

164
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:23,340
Yamato with 2002 does that mean we're heavenly?

165
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:28,940
This show is heavenly, except we're all going to hell.

166
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:30,940
I made a joke.

167
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:31,940
Yay.

168
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:34,940
Ten Goku joke.

169
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:39,180
And I was going to make it an all-numbers set, but Jamie really wanted to hear Ninzaburrow,

170
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:42,420
and that didn't sound like such a bad idea, so you had a couple numbered songs and then

171
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:46,420
Ninzaburrow.

172
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:47,420
Ninzaburrow is cool.

173
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:48,420
Yeah.

174
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:51,060
I'm still trying to find episodes of the show.

175
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:53,100
It sounded a little fast to you, huh?

176
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:54,100
Yeah.

177
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:57,560
You know, I think the song is just really, it is a lot faster and a lot of people remember

178
00:15:57,560 --> 00:16:04,620
because it seems like in DDR, they started to just double the speed of arrows on songs

179
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:09,960
that weren't necessarily that big a tempo like, I don't know, Max 300.

180
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:15,320
And especially in fourth mix, remember how fast dropout seemed in fourth mix?

181
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:17,640
Because dropout was like the Max 300 of its time, right?

182
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:20,960
It was just like, oh my God, the arrows are coming up so fast.

183
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:29,360
you go and you play dropout on max 2 or something, you're like, oh this is easy. Dropout's easy.

184
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:34,080
It's weird how much that frame rate totally changed things. So I think that's why Ninzaburro

185
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:40,200
maybe, well then again of course that goes reverse my philosophy because Ninzaburro would

186
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:44,600
have played faster, I don't know. Well I guess it depends if you played it on 4th or 5th

187
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:50,560
because fifth mix is when the frame rate started to change so I don't know I'm

188
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:57,240
talking myself into a corner here help hi hi so um as we usually like to start

189
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:01,880
off the show we're gonna ask everybody how their week and their day was so

190
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:06,440
we'll start with Jamie because it kind of relates to the pre-show so the

191
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:10,600
beginning of the week was okay well it was really good because that's when

192
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:17,380
Ma and Chan and Rick were here, and had a very good time.

193
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:23,480
The air conditioner went out, though, on Sunday night, or during the day on Sunday, and it

194
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:29,500
was out Monday and it was out Tuesday and it was out Wednesday, and it was really hot

195
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:30,500
on Wednesday.

196
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:35,060
I went to work and I was feeling just wretched, but I made it through my day at work, I mean

197
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:36,060
sorry, Tuesday.

198
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:39,900
I went back to work and I was feeling really crappy.

199
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:43,220
I went to work Wednesday and was feeling even worse.

200
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:47,980
And then when I went into work Thursday, I don't remember the entire drive to work, and

201
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:48,980
that's not a good sign.

202
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:51,780
You didn't fall asleep during the drive, did you?

203
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:52,780
I don't know.

204
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:55,420
I don't remember.

205
00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:59,260
I was having bad dizzy spells, and finally I asked if I could go home.

206
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:00,460
I was not feeling good at all.

207
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:02,820
I was running a fever.

208
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:08,820
I remember driving home, but I had dizzy spells on the way home, which, good thing there was

209
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:15,300
light traffic, so I got home and scheduled myself, and everyone knows me, I don't go

210
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:19,820
to the doctor unless I have to, and I scheduled myself an appointment for the doctor that

211
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:25,460
night, and it turns out that I have a respiratory infection and an ear infection in my right

212
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:26,460
ear.

213
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:29,260
I am no longer contagious, which is good for you guys.

214
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:30,260
That's a very good sign, thank you.

215
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:35,100
Because I've been on antibiotics now all weekend, I'm going to be on antibiotics for the rest

216
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:37,100
of the week after that.

217
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:48,940
I'm on this stuff that I have to put up my nose and squirt and it burns.

218
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:51,420
It smells like burning.

219
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:57,780
And I'm on my inhaler again for a buterol, which I was supposed to get six refills of

220
00:18:57,780 --> 00:19:00,540
it and I only got like zero.

221
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:04,700
So I'm going to have to make sure that it wasn't my doctor's doctor handwriting, which

222
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:11,900
is basic doctor handwriting.

223
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:20,660
I was feeling a lot better, though, on Friday after sleeping for about 15 hours, and did

224
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:23,880
my thing that day.

225
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:31,260
Yesterday though, I got up at the butt crack of dawn, which is about 10 in the morning

226
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:37,620
for me and made it over to Iguana Girl's house and a bunch of us all went to see Weird Al

227
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:38,620
in Madera.

228
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:39,620
How's Moo doing?

229
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:41,820
Moo is so cute.

230
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:44,180
Moo got a big belly.

231
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:49,540
Moo is Iguana Girl's Iguana.

232
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:54,180
We have a regular chatter named Moo and we have a Mooheimer.

233
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:55,340
This is Moo the Cute.

234
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:56,340
There's lots of Moos.

235
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:59,500
Moo the Cute Iguana.

236
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:01,180
And Moo was being antsy all day.

237
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:09,980
It was being a little butt, but that's okay because Moo is cute.

238
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:16,900
Melody came with us, which was really awesome, but we all went and hung around at the crappy

239
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:17,900
fair.

240
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:20,140
It was kind of fun for being a crap fair.

241
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:25,300
My reaction to seeing the fair was, that's it, so we went to IHOP instead, and I tell

242
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:30,740
you the IHOP was the happiest place on earth, Dethro and Disneyland, because there was happy

243
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:34,240
everywhere, it looks like happy. Well, certainly this week anyway. Did you hear about what

244
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:40,920
happened to Disneyland? That's pretty damn funny. And we were talking about it too. We

245
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:44,300
were talking about it on the trip and we think it's just because the guy was doing something

246
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:52,100
stupid because he was up in the front. We think that he was trying to get into the train.

247
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:55,040
Like he was trying to jump from the train into another one or something? No, trying

248
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:59,040
I'm trying to get into the front part.

249
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:04,040
The train derailed and got jammed in the tunnel, then all the cars going that fast smashed into it.

250
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:05,040
Oh.

251
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:06,040
That's what happened.

252
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:08,040
I still think it's that guy's fault.

253
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:11,040
Let's just blame it on stupidity.

254
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:16,040
It's a little kid who threw gum on a track or something like that.

255
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:18,040
Even better, let's blame it on a little kid.

256
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:19,040
Stupid children.

257
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:24,040
That child is a murderer and should be hung.

258
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:33,040
Whoa, that's kind of neat in the chatroom. It looks a little curvy. It looks like a big nose, like Mario's nose or something.

259
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:34,040
What?

260
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:38,040
I was looking at the curve that the text took in the chatroom. It was kind of neat looking.

261
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:39,040
Okay.

262
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:40,040
I'm sick.

263
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:41,040
Jamie's going crazy.

264
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:42,040
Fuck you.

265
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:46,040
Jamie's taking a little too many meds.

266
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:49,040
Bummer ferret. You see this? It's mine now.

267
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:50,040
Give me a ferret.

268
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:51,040
It's mine.

269
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:52,040
Give me a ferret.

270
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:53,040
You have a ferret.

271
00:21:53,040 --> 00:22:07,440
We all sat in our seats and everything, and we had to go find Julie and Krista and Becky

272
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,540
and all of them who weren't going to meet us there.

273
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:11,540
People you don't know, listeners of Orange On The Radio.

274
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:14,180
Julie's been in the chat room before.

275
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:15,180
Oh, that's true.

276
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:16,180
That's right.

277
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:17,180
That's right.

278
00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:18,180
She has.

279
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:19,180
My bad.

280
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:23,840
Weird Al was awesome and fabulous and there were these stupid fuckers around us smoking

281
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:26,060
them getting to that later.

282
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:27,060
I hope they die.

283
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:28,060
Smoking crack or what?

284
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:29,900
And then there were these sluts in the row in front of us.

285
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:30,900
I swear.

286
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:32,300
They were trying to out hoochie each other.

287
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:33,300
Wait.

288
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:34,300
Sluts don't listen to Weird Al.

289
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:35,300
No.

290
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:36,300
No.

291
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:37,300
They were in the front row and they were being sluts.

292
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:39,300
They were trying to out slut each other.

293
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:46,180
Trying to be super skank and everything and he was making fun of them the whole show.

294
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:49,060
It was great.

295
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:54,820
And because he went to see one of the sluts that was in front of us to make fun of her

296
00:22:54,820 --> 00:23:03,440
during the, what is this song called, the one where he's going through all of the pick

297
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:04,440
up lines?

298
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:05,440
I don't know.

299
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:09,140
I don't listen to enough Weird Al, I like Weird Al, but I don't follow him enough.

300
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:12,420
He was like right in front of us, so I got a good look at him and everything, and I took

301
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:15,820
a picture of the back of his head during One More Minute.

302
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:17,500
So wait, you guys were in the second row?

303
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:21,820
Well, there was like the priority seating in front of us that was about six

304
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:25,680
rows that were all blocked off and then, but he came into our area too

305
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:27,680
to make fun of the sluts, I guess.

306
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:31,960
He went way back in the whole paid seating area, it was great. That's cool.

307
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:35,240
Pay for your tickets when you go to the fair, you'll get good seats.

308
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:37,480
Loki, they went to Fresno

309
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:39,760
at the Madera County Fair.

310
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:42,320
But today was Great America, I'm surprised you didn't go.

311
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:46,480
Because it's forty bucks. Not you, Loki.

312
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:50,400
I was going to go, but that was supposed to be for my birthday.

313
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:56,720
But yeah, no one took me.

314
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:58,520
I didn't know he wanted to go.

315
00:23:58,520 --> 00:23:59,520
I would have taken him.

316
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:01,720
I had this plan for a month and a half.

317
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:04,760
I know.

318
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:06,400
You guys all piled in a van, right?

319
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:12,280
Yeah, Vandalous took us in his van, his SUV.

320
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:19,680
It was a comfy SUV, too, and I sort of slept on the way back, but it was a really fun time,

321
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:24,960
and it was funny watching the skanks shred out, skank each other, but this one girl decided

322
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:29,560
that she had to dance every time, so we're like, sit your stupid skinny butt down, you're

323
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:30,560
ugly.

324
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:32,920
Did she say she was ugly?

325
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:39,280
No, we just were like, hey, down in front, and she's like, oh, oh, I'm sorry, I'm stupid,

326
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:41,720
and sat down.

327
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:46,840
He changed the Yoda chant, well not really changed it, but more like expanded it.

328
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:47,840
It was pretty cool.

329
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:49,520
And for those that don't know what the Yoda chant is?

330
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:52,400
I don't remember how to do the whole Yoda chant.

331
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:58,080
If you've been to a weird house show, you know the Yoda chant.

332
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:04,120
He did that stupid, he did the stinky song that was making fun of that stupid personnelly

333
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:08,840
like I hate.

334
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:12,680
Let's get in hot in here, so take off all your clothes."

335
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:13,680
Yeah, I know that one.

336
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:19,200
They put a bunch of trash cans on the stage, it was great, and they did all about the Pentiums,

337
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,200
and did, of course, one more minute.

338
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,360
Is it just me or is Weird Al getting old?

339
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:24,360
Shut up.

340
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:27,280
He's got a baby.

341
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:28,280
I know.

342
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:29,280
Well, he didn't have the baby.

343
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:30,920
Well, his wife has a baby.

344
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:35,800
But still, I saw him in an interview recently, and I'm like, Weird Al's getting old?

345
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:36,800
It was weird.

346
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:37,800
You're getting old too.

347
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:38,800
I know.

348
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:42,480
We're all getting old, but he's getting, like, really old.

349
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:44,640
I still kind of look like my yearbook picture.

350
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:47,240
He doesn't look very old at all.

351
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:51,880
He did some of his parody interviews.

352
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:53,400
I'm moving out in the living room so people can see me.

353
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:54,400
I want to be on the panel.

354
00:25:54,400 --> 00:26:01,240
He did one with Justin Timberlake and Britney on the TV.

355
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:02,240
It was great.

356
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:03,880
Justin Timberlake is the best sock.

357
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:05,880
The best one was the Celine Dion one.

358
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:06,880
Oh, shit.

359
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:11,600
Well, I know when you were a child, you had this traumatic experience where you're going

360
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:13,920
skiing and your whole family was eaten by cannibals.

361
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:17,240
He's like, yes, I remember the smell of my mother cooking.

362
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:19,960
He's like, I bet it was horrible for you.

363
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:21,960
No, it was fun.

364
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:27,280
The Avril Lavigne one, he's like, say something incoherently for us.

365
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:31,480
Well, I don't think, you know, she's going off on something, it was really great.

366
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:34,720
And the interviews were great.

367
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:37,720
This is actually, I think, the one tonight is his last show of the tour.

368
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:38,720
Oh, yeah.

369
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:42,600
So all you people missed out.

370
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:44,240
Here's Jamie's chance to rub it in.

371
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:49,640
With a ferret.

372
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:53,900
So weird owl, skanks, good songs, good time.

373
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:56,200
I have pictures, and I took pictures of the fireworks.

374
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:59,480
Tell me about where you guys went to eat, because this is a funny story.

375
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:00,480
I hop.

376
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,160
I told you about I hop.

377
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:03,160
You told me about it?

378
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:04,160
Did you tell them?

379
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:13,280
I hope it was the happiest place on earth, because it looked like Happy up and threw

380
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:14,680
up all over it.

381
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:19,760
It's like Happy decided to pop and go, oh, I'm happy, happy, puke, and the whole place

382
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:21,040
was covered in happy faces.

383
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:23,040
So it looked like a Walmart.

384
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:24,040
Yeah.

385
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:25,040
Walmart is not a happy place.

386
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:31,320
It made Walmart look like the sewer.

387
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:32,880
rat-infested

388
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:39,320
Sewer that it is, but anyway, I'll talk about that later much later, and I have issues with Walmart this week

389
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:43,640
But it was it was too happy and then today. I

390
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:47,360
We got home at like 3 30 long enough for me to do a little

391
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:53,520
Post-lit in my life journal, and then I passed out and was dead for a while, and then I got up early

392
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:59,800
I have to interject a pixie dust comment from the chat room.

393
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:05,640
It says, well, rub it in all you want, but IHOP has the rooty-tooty fresh and free.

394
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:09,180
I had pumpkin pancakes, and that's much better.

395
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:10,880
You know what the best pancake is, though?

396
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:11,880
Pumpkin.

397
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:13,880
No, the one that looks like the smiley face.

398
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:14,880
No, pumpkin.

399
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:15,880
The smiley face.

400
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:16,880
Pumpkin.

401
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:17,880
It had pumpkin syrup.

402
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:19,740
Oh, it's so good.

403
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:20,740
So today?

404
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:21,740
Oh, pumpkin.

405
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:27,920
Today, I felt like shit, and I felt like shit when I went home, because I'm still sick and

406
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:33,360
I shouldn't have gone, and I had to go around the livestock, but I got to shoot a man yesterday.

407
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:36,760
Oh yeah, you shot a guy like 33 times?

408
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:39,520
They had a paintball thing, and I was shooting little targets.

409
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:46,640
I shot a bunny in the head, and I shot a teddy bear in the ass, and I was shooting all the

410
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:51,280
small targets, and then I decided to use my last 20 or so shots on the

411
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:53,920
man himself who was just standing there all padded up.

412
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:54,920
I got him in the head.

413
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:55,920
And it was the real guy.

414
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:58,800
Real guy, all bundled up in paintball gear.

415
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:00,880
I shot him in the head.

416
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:02,320
I shot him in his heart.

417
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:03,900
I shot him in his groin.

418
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:08,800
I shot him in the right kneecap enough to make him back up a step.

419
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:11,080
And I shot him a bunch of other places, and I think I shot him in the

420
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:15,400
eyeball once, but he was wearing goggles, so it wasn't much fun.

421
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:18,400
I was like, oh, no more?

422
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:21,400
Was there a little heckler there, too, that was telling you to shut up?

423
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:22,400
Who is this?

424
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:23,400
Some stupid little kid.

425
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:24,400
You can curse on OrangeHawn's radio.

426
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:25,400
It's OK.

427
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:26,400
I don't feel like cursing.

428
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:28,400
I feel like being clean today because I'm sick.

429
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:31,400
You know I'm sick when I'm talking like a good little girl.

430
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:32,400
Fuck him.

431
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:33,400
Stupid little kid.

432
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:34,400
OK.

433
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:35,400
Stupid little kid.

434
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:36,400
OK.

435
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:37,400
Hit it.

436
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:38,400
Hit the guy.

437
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:39,400
Hit the guy.

438
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:40,400
Don't hit the little thing.

439
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:41,400
Hit the guy.

440
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:42,400
Hit the man.

441
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:43,400
I'm like, OK.

442
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:44,400
This is where Vandalous is going.

443
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:48,040
I told the kid, okay, don't talk when I'm shooting or I'll shoot you.

444
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:49,040
I didn't say that.

445
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:52,280
I was like, don't talk, do me a favor kid, don't talk when I'm shooting.

446
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:53,280
But it's fun.

447
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:54,800
I was like, no, it's not.

448
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:57,720
I would have turned that gun right around and opened fire.

449
00:29:57,720 --> 00:30:00,680
Oh, the thing was so touchy.

450
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:04,440
I could have had that thing go, blub, blub, blub, blub, blub, blub, die.

451
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:06,120
It was a very touchy gun.

452
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:08,420
But we all shot people, it was good.

453
00:30:08,420 --> 00:30:12,080
I've done that with the water gun, but they only turned so far, you can't really shoot

454
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:13,600
your neighbor, but you can get a stream point.

455
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:20,600
I could have pulled this thing completely out and gone on a murderous paintball rampage.

456
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:22,600
Why would you?

457
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:24,600
Because there weren't enough children around.

458
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:29,600
Just that one kid and he wasn't worth me wasting the ammo I paid for.

459
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:33,600
It was a good time and today I felt really crappy.

460
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:41,600
I took a picture of a cow that was acting like a cat hunched down like Shermie does,

461
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:47,960
the camera licking his shoulder. I'm cute. I think I'm a cat, but I'm really a cow, boo.

462
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:56,960
We came up with some retarded animal sounds. Moo. Moo. I think that was... Okay. We were

463
00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:03,120
in the IHOP going, yay, and then talking about animals. Somebody was saying earlier in the

464
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:08,340
chat room that Weird Al should be in Bamani. No. No, I don't think so either. I don't want

465
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:13,220
Bimani to ruin Weird Al, but Weird Al should do a parody of a Bimani song.

466
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:14,220
No.

467
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:16,220
I think he should.

468
00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:18,700
He'd make like, Love Me Do the Polka.

469
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:22,340
That would be great, a Bimani polka, come on.

470
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:23,620
Tell me that would not be beautiful.

471
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:28,940
I don't think he'd do it.

472
00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:31,540
I-I-I-I am your little butterfly.

473
00:31:31,540 --> 00:31:32,540
No.

474
00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:33,540
No.

475
00:31:33,540 --> 00:31:35,540
No smell-decay polka, thank you.

476
00:31:35,540 --> 00:31:41,540
But anyway, I was sick all day, but we went out for lunch with somebody in this room.

477
00:31:41,540 --> 00:31:42,540
Hi.

478
00:31:42,540 --> 00:31:43,540
Hi.

479
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:50,660
And it was lots of fun, and then I picked up my Transformers comics today like I do

480
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:51,660
every Sunday.

481
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:52,660
Uh-huh.

482
00:31:52,660 --> 00:32:01,380
And came back home, and Melody took a nap with Shermie.

483
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:02,380
Aww.

484
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:07,460
And I bummed her out online and then she went home but she's coming back because her laptop's

485
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:08,860
at my house.

486
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:13,940
So we'll have a special surprise visit from Shark's Girl in a little while.

487
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:14,940
Surprise!

488
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:15,940
Surprise!

489
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:22,420
So I might have to leave a bit early but I'm doing other things here too.

490
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:25,780
Yeah, my clothes are visiting too.

491
00:32:25,780 --> 00:32:27,300
Yes, lankystyle has it.

492
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:29,540
He says superstar polka style.

493
00:32:29,540 --> 00:32:30,540
No!

494
00:32:30,540 --> 00:32:31,540
No!

495
00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:36,540
I'm here today.

496
00:32:36,540 --> 00:32:39,540
That earned you a fap in the head by the ferret.

497
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:41,540
Did you say a fap in the head?

498
00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:42,540
I said a fap.

499
00:32:42,540 --> 00:32:44,540
I thought she said a fap.

500
00:32:44,540 --> 00:32:48,540
Okay, it earned you a fap in the head by the ferret.

501
00:32:48,540 --> 00:32:50,540
The ferret will hump your head.

502
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:53,540
The ferret will fap you in the head.

503
00:32:53,540 --> 00:32:54,540
Anyway.

504
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:59,540
But I still, I'm, you know, not feeling very well right now.

505
00:32:59,540 --> 00:33:04,900
Don't expect much out of me, but whining and angst.

506
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:07,020
You can't whine with your angst today.

507
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:08,860
What do we expect from you usually?

508
00:33:08,860 --> 00:33:09,860
Shut up.

509
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:16,540
You need to be funny and excited and bouncy and you know what, on top of that, my purse

510
00:33:16,540 --> 00:33:19,540
is dead, which puts me off, so I'm going to use my bunny backpack.

511
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:25,020
My bunny backpack broke, so now I have it rigged because it's the only thing I have.

512
00:33:25,020 --> 00:33:26,020
I have to go buy a new purse.

513
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:27,020
I don't have any money.

514
00:33:27,020 --> 00:33:32,180
And I have to put on the credit card, probably, because I need a purse, and Matt's humping

515
00:33:32,180 --> 00:33:35,180
the chair.

516
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:36,180
He's fapping the chair.

517
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:37,180
You're fapping the chair.

518
00:33:37,180 --> 00:33:42,180
You were faced the other way.

519
00:33:42,180 --> 00:33:47,980
Oh, John Field suggests a bye-bye baby balloon polka.

520
00:33:47,980 --> 00:33:49,380
A polka polka!

521
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:50,380
Yes!

522
00:33:50,380 --> 00:33:51,380
No!

523
00:33:51,380 --> 00:33:58,380
I don't have energy.

524
00:33:58,380 --> 00:34:00,220
Stand up!

525
00:34:00,220 --> 00:34:01,740
Stand up!

526
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:03,020
Stand up!

527
00:34:03,020 --> 00:34:04,180
Stand up!

528
00:34:04,180 --> 00:34:05,180
Why?

529
00:34:05,180 --> 00:34:06,180
Stand up!

530
00:34:06,180 --> 00:34:08,980
I don't want to stand up.

531
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:09,980
No!

532
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:10,980
Stand up!

533
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:12,980
I'm standing up.

534
00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:14,180
Ow!

535
00:34:14,180 --> 00:34:17,180
No polka!

536
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:20,900
I only want polka!

537
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:25,460
I want a Joga Polka, come on. I want Trance Polka.

538
00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:32,020
The Beauty of Silence Polka. The Beauty of Polka!

539
00:34:32,020 --> 00:34:35,540
That's a remix you should do.

540
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:40,100
I'm sorry, I don't make crap.

541
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:45,860
Is T-Dog listening? Maybe he could make a Beauty of Polka.

542
00:34:45,860 --> 00:34:49,740
Don't put it past him. That's my new name, T-Dog.

543
00:34:49,740 --> 00:34:51,740
You know who?

544
00:34:51,740 --> 00:34:53,740
Newt!

545
00:34:53,740 --> 00:34:55,740
Well said, huh?

546
00:34:55,740 --> 00:34:57,740
Anyway...

547
00:34:57,740 --> 00:34:59,740
Hi Newt!

548
00:34:59,740 --> 00:35:01,740
Is that all you have to say about your day and your week?

549
00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:03,740
I think I have a fever again

550
00:35:03,740 --> 00:35:05,740
and I have to go to work tomorrow

551
00:35:05,740 --> 00:35:07,740
You don't have to

552
00:35:07,740 --> 00:35:09,740
Unless you want to get fired

553
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:11,740
I have a doctor's excuse though

554
00:35:11,740 --> 00:35:13,740
so nah

555
00:35:13,740 --> 00:35:15,740
And I'm on lots of drugs

556
00:35:15,740 --> 00:35:17,740
I have to snort liquid cocaine

557
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:25,340
cocaine. Cool. I don't know. It's called Nasrel. It's like burned. It's like inhaling snot

558
00:35:25,340 --> 00:35:31,620
but on fire. It's really disgusting. Ferb is criticizing my pronunciation of Domdaryam.

559
00:35:31,620 --> 00:35:42,300
It's Domdaryam. Domdaryam. Domdaryam. How about Domdaryam? No. Daryam. I like Daryam

560
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:49,180
because it sounds like derriere. It's a stupid JOGA song. Stupid JOGA song. From now on...

561
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:53,560
You know what? I don't care if my pronunciation of Dom Doyon was a little odd and wrong because

562
00:35:53,560 --> 00:36:01,560
the British say everything odd. So, you know what? Shut up! That's mean. I'm just kidding.

563
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:12,260
So in Kick Rob... You're closer. Kick Rob for me. No. Okay. Anyway, let's go on to Loki

564
00:36:12,260 --> 00:36:14,860
if you're done talking about your week I'm gonna tickle my laundry

565
00:36:14,860 --> 00:36:19,460
K I think your wash is done because I don't hear it spinning anymore. In the meantime we'll talk to Loki

566
00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:22,700
I have a long board. I have a long board. It was alright

567
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:27,340
I didn't do anything. Sat there. Rotting away at work

568
00:36:27,340 --> 00:36:31,500
I want spinners tonight

569
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:34,860
those are going to be for my BeatMania controller. And what is a spinner?

570
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:39,060
It's exactly that. It spins. It's a little controller. Like a top?

571
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:41,060
Like a knob.

572
00:36:43,060 --> 00:36:44,060
Spins like a knob.

573
00:36:44,060 --> 00:36:45,060
You bought a knob.

574
00:36:46,060 --> 00:36:47,060
Two knobs.

575
00:36:48,060 --> 00:36:56,060
Anyways, so, um, I bought those and then, um, pretty much worked on my pads a little bit.

576
00:36:56,060 --> 00:36:58,060
Have all the metal bent on them now.

577
00:36:58,060 --> 00:37:03,060
And, um, made a remix, did some show.

578
00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:05,060
Yes, we have a new Loki remix coming soon.

579
00:37:06,060 --> 00:37:07,060
Tonight. At some point. Yes?

580
00:37:07,060 --> 00:37:10,760
at some point yes i already finished it i said during the show

581
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:12,600
maybe next break then

582
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:17,060
maybe maybe alright i dedicated it to the uh...

583
00:37:17,060 --> 00:37:20,580
that around railroad train the crash

584
00:37:20,580 --> 00:37:21,940
okay

585
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:23,460
so we have the uh...

586
00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:26,780
whatever song it's going to be big thunder mountain mixer witnesses

587
00:37:26,780 --> 00:37:29,700
well i like that one better i want to change it

588
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:33,500
but it was just going to be called the rail mix but uh... the big but i like

589
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:35,500
I like the big Thunder Mountain mix.

590
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:37,500
How many of your remixes have I named?

591
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:40,500
This is at least the second or third one.

592
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:43,500
I named another one. There was another one I named.

593
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:47,500
It was Matrix 1, Gravity Reloaded.

594
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:49,500
Yeah, uh-huh.

595
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:51,500
I rule. You just don't want to admit it.

596
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:52,500
Whatever.

597
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:54,500
Since I have money, I have to go buy the...

598
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:57,500
I was shopping for a computer today for my main cabinet,

599
00:37:57,500 --> 00:37:59,500
and that was expensive, so I didn't buy it.

600
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:03,300
and I was going to shop for parts online for the main cabinet.

601
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:05,420
That was also expensive, so I didn't buy it.

602
00:38:05,420 --> 00:38:08,500
And so pretty much, it's just pricing stuff right now

603
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:11,500
and working on it and that kind of thing.

604
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:13,100
But anyways.

605
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:15,700
Mikey style says a spinner is a short, thin girl.

606
00:38:22,420 --> 00:38:24,260
Loki buying that online?

607
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:25,420
Never.

608
00:38:25,420 --> 00:38:27,500
And two of them.

609
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:34,500
I resent that, because one day I'm going to invent the one that women can have, and

610
00:38:57,500 --> 00:38:59,420
that

611
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:01,700
my friend there to have cocks for women

612
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:03,060
the bajai cock

613
00:39:03,060 --> 00:39:03,880
no

614
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:06,740
i have that will she's not really a friend i guess anymore but this girl

615
00:39:06,740 --> 00:39:10,100
that i know who's really responsible and is kind of stupid

616
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:11,820
she said she wanted a dick

617
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:14,580
so that she could whip it out and piss on people

618
00:39:14,580 --> 00:39:18,260
all right we know what happens when people wish for dicks okay we've already watched that

619
00:39:18,260 --> 00:39:20,220
movie i haven't

620
00:39:20,220 --> 00:39:21,260
having a dick

621
00:39:21,260 --> 00:39:24,220
it isn't all that because when you get a dick

622
00:39:24,220 --> 00:39:28,320
When you get a dick, you get balls as well, and people can kick you there, and imagine

623
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:29,680
like your entire three day...

624
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:31,820
I've often said it's much better to be a woman.

625
00:39:31,820 --> 00:39:37,560
Imagine your whole three days worth of cramps piled into five seconds of intense pain.

626
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:39,140
That's what being kicked in the balls feels like.

627
00:39:39,140 --> 00:39:42,880
Yeah, but the five seconds goes away.

628
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:46,140
You have no idea what cramps feel like.

629
00:39:46,140 --> 00:39:49,420
Imagine having pain that makes you puke.

630
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:52,060
Somebody once told me what having a baby felt like.

631
00:39:52,060 --> 00:39:55,180
it's like pulling your lower lip over your head.

632
00:39:55,180 --> 00:39:57,140
That's what somebody told me it was.

633
00:39:57,140 --> 00:39:58,140
Family guy.

634
00:39:58,140 --> 00:40:00,300
It's off a family guy, you freaking loser.

635
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:05,780
There was a movie that described it as trying to push something the size of a watermelon

636
00:40:05,780 --> 00:40:09,580
out of something, a hole the size of a pea.

637
00:40:09,580 --> 00:40:10,580
I think it was a lemon.

638
00:40:10,580 --> 00:40:11,580
A lemon, yeah.

639
00:40:11,580 --> 00:40:14,540
And that was Chasing Amy.

640
00:40:14,540 --> 00:40:16,620
Giving birth sucks and I'm never going to do it.

641
00:40:16,620 --> 00:40:19,700
That's why they cut open your stomach and pulled a damn kid out.

642
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:21,380
It's just like, what the hell's the point?

643
00:40:21,380 --> 00:40:25,200
It's like trying to shove a piano through a door when there's a perfectly good window

644
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:27,200
right there.

645
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:34,700
I mean, I don't see the point.

646
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:36,920
And that's why men will never have babies.

647
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:39,760
The genius of Loki on Orange Lounge Radio.

648
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:43,180
You know what?

649
00:40:43,180 --> 00:40:46,360
It's bad enough that the world has to deal with me.

650
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:50,040
I'm not putting any more children on this earth, but congratulations to those who have,

651
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:56,600
Oh yeah, I found out this week that my sister's probably going to need brain surgery.

652
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:57,600
Really?

653
00:40:57,600 --> 00:41:00,960
Yeah, because she has something wrong with her pituitary gland or something like that

654
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:06,920
that's causing her cells, and I quote, went crazy.

655
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:11,660
And so they're like, that affects how much your blood's produced and other crap like

656
00:41:11,660 --> 00:41:12,660
that.

657
00:41:12,660 --> 00:41:15,480
So they have to operate or possibly treat medication.

658
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:16,480
Ouch.

659
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:19,880
Sure it is.

660
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:20,860
How was that funny?

661
00:41:20,860 --> 00:41:23,000
I don't know.

662
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:26,260
It's not life threatening, so it's not bad.

663
00:41:26,260 --> 00:41:30,120
I would imagine having someone operate on your brain itself

664
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:32,400
is life threatening.

665
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:34,840
Would you like, oh, hi, we're going to open your head

666
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:36,040
and poke with your brain.

667
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:38,520
It doesn't hurt, it kind of tickles.

668
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:40,920
And you've had brain surgery, that would explain it.

669
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:42,840
That would explain a few things.

670
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:48,160
No, yeah, so not much going on other than my birthday

671
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:49,600
this week, but you know.

672
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:51,000
Happy birthday.

673
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,800
Yeah, it hasn't occurred yet.

674
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:54,520
9-11 is when my birthday is.

675
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:57,120
But I'm thinking in advance, because I'm not going to.

676
00:41:57,120 --> 00:41:58,200
Well, I might be over here.

677
00:41:58,200 --> 00:42:00,840
Anyways, but yeah, so I went ahead

678
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:06,040
and we kind of had a little party for me on Saturday

679
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:07,800
for just kind of because my mom's

680
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:10,440
going to be out of town for both my birthday and my sister's

681
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:13,200
birthday, so kind of lumped us all together

682
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:14,840
and did all that kind of thing.

683
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:16,600
Happy collective birthday.

684
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:17,520
Yes.

685
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:19,160
And so that was kind of cool.

686
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:21,480
And then, I don't know what's going on this week.

687
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:24,720
Supposed to go out to dinner with my girlfriend on Thursday.

688
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:26,760
And yeah, that's about it.

689
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:31,520
My turn.

690
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:34,440
My week was kind of shitty because I was, like Jamie,

691
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:35,080
I was sick.

692
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:38,000
I didn't have quite the multiple layers of infection

693
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,640
that she had in the end.

694
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:41,360
Oh yeah, I had a sinus infection too.

695
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:43,320
And they tested me for strep throat, but I don't have it.

696
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:44,640
I was just feeling like shit.

697
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:45,880
And it wasn't to the point where I'm like,

698
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:47,360
ah, I got to go to a doctor.

699
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:50,220
Because I just went to the doctor a couple of weeks ago for something else, and after

700
00:42:50,220 --> 00:42:56,200
that whole experience I didn't want to go back for a while, so I just kind of slept

701
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:57,200
it off.

702
00:42:57,200 --> 00:43:02,560
Literally, I went to work, I would come home, nap, wake up for an hour, and go to bed.

703
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:04,240
That was my week, pretty much.

704
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:05,240
It sucked.

705
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:07,640
And then I had this huge thing on my arm.

706
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:14,960
I don't know if it's a zit or what, but I saw one of my exes on Thursday who I hadn't

707
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:20,560
in quite a while. And of course, he's got one of those sarcastic kinds of humor. And

708
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:24,880
no, it is not AIDS. He said, it looks like I do drugs.

709
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:28,320
It's who it is. So now I'm kind of like, oh, cool, I can go

710
00:43:28,320 --> 00:43:31,200
around and show people at work. Like people at work probably think I do drugs. That's

711
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:35,480
pretty cool. But then I show my mother and she's like,

712
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:39,480
you've got a bone. It's an infected blood vessel and you're going to die if you don't

713
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:44,480
go to the doctor and get it taken care of. Have you tried Lansing yet?

714
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:48,800
Well, I can't, but it's going down, so why make a big deal out of it if it's going down?

715
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:49,800
That's why I told her.

716
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:50,800
Well, make sure that you take Benadryl.

717
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:51,800
Benadryl.

718
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:52,800
Take him before bed, people.

719
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:53,800
Knock your ass out.

720
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:58,000
That's what I've been living on is Benadryl at night.

721
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,560
That's my anti-drug.

722
00:43:59,560 --> 00:44:03,280
My mother also told me something very scary yesterday that made me kind of want to hit

723
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:04,280
her.

724
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:05,280
What?

725
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:10,440
She said, I'm so in love with Cher that I think I'm a lesbian, and then she laughed.

726
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:15,440
And I was like, don't you EVER say that again!

727
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:16,440
This is alarming!

728
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:18,440
That is very alarming!

729
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:28,280
You know, I wouldn't say it's too much lesbianism there, because she is quite mannish.

730
00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:29,280
Cher that is.

731
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:31,160
She sounds like a, she sings like a horse.

732
00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:32,800
That was pretty much my response.

733
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:37,800
She doesn't look like a horse.

734
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:41,680
For those who wonder, Cher was actually doing a concert in Sacramento last night.

735
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:43,460
It was her farewell tour.

736
00:44:43,460 --> 00:44:48,080
Second time she's been here, by the way, on the farewell tour.

737
00:44:48,080 --> 00:44:51,600
We went the first time, so we didn't see the need to go the second time.

738
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:54,520
I know why she's doing a farewell tour, because she's running out of things to do plastic

739
00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:55,520
surgery on.

740
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:56,520
Seriously.

741
00:44:56,520 --> 00:45:01,980
But the second time, Cyndi Lauper wasn't opening, so it wasn't worth going to, because the first

742
00:45:01,980 --> 00:45:04,740
time Cyndi Lauper was opening, so I was like, okay, cool.

743
00:45:04,740 --> 00:45:07,660
But this time, some other Shmo was opening, so forget it.

744
00:45:07,660 --> 00:45:33,700
So I decided to go out last night because I'm feeling better.

745
00:45:33,700 --> 00:45:34,700
So I went out with my buddy Matt.

746
00:45:34,700 --> 00:45:39,500
I was supposed to go to some barbeque with Irene and Brad, but they never called me.

747
00:45:39,500 --> 00:45:41,540
I went out with Matt instead.

748
00:45:41,540 --> 00:45:46,940
We went to the Streets of London, which is a little pub downtown.

749
00:45:46,940 --> 00:45:50,980
We went to this place and I ate this huge plate of...

750
00:45:50,980 --> 00:45:55,140
The Streets of London has the best fish and chips.

751
00:45:55,140 --> 00:45:56,780
Well, I didn't have that.

752
00:45:56,780 --> 00:46:00,020
I had a big plate of fries covered in cheese and bacon.

753
00:46:00,020 --> 00:46:01,380
Mmm, fat, yes.

754
00:46:01,380 --> 00:46:02,380
Chips.

755
00:46:02,380 --> 00:46:03,380
Sorry.

756
00:46:03,380 --> 00:46:04,380
Chips, cheese, and bacon.

757
00:46:04,380 --> 00:46:23,580
dad. Stupid British slang. So we went there, and I actually drank beer, but it was Guinness,

758
00:46:23,580 --> 00:46:24,580
so I'm forgiven.

759
00:46:24,580 --> 00:46:29,180
Guinness is beautiful. Guinness is the drink of the gods.

760
00:46:29,180 --> 00:46:32,300
After that, we went over to the Depot because it was kind of late. We didn't really want

761
00:46:32,300 --> 00:46:36,340
to go dancing, dancing. So we went over to the Depot, which is a gay bar in Sacramento.

762
00:46:36,340 --> 00:46:39,940
Me and my friend Matt, the Ice Princess, been on this show before. We went over there and

763
00:46:39,940 --> 00:46:44,880
then we met a whole bunch of other people there. We met two people he knew from online

764
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:51,180
and we met Phoenix, also Corey. You may or may not have met him. I don't know if you

765
00:46:51,180 --> 00:46:56,720
have before or not. And then our other friend Joshy, who's leaving town, we just had a good

766
00:46:56,720 --> 00:47:01,520
old time. We were partying it up. But this is the funny thing. It was the Cher concert

767
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:07,680
after party. So they started playing just like nonstop Cher stuff and we're like, okay,

768
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:11,000
we have to go. And we went to this new burger joint they opened up next door. It's a brand

769
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:15,600
new burger joint. It's a gay burger joint in the gay district of Sacramento. It's called

770
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:23,640
hot rods. I didn't get to play pinball at the depot last night, though. That made me

771
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:26,240
sad. There was actually people on them all night, but they have pinball at the depot.

772
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:29,160
Was there good food, though, at the hot rods?

773
00:47:29,160 --> 00:47:36,280
Hot rods, actually, the fries are damn good. It's a lot like In-N-Out, the place, but they

774
00:47:36,280 --> 00:47:39,800
have more. They have garden burgers if you want them. They have turkey burgers if you

775
00:47:39,800 --> 00:47:45,680
you want them. They have the hot dogs if you're into that, chicken strips, whatever. They

776
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:48,680
have way bigger menu. Some people like hot dogs.

777
00:47:48,680 --> 00:48:04,680
Some people like Polish dogs. Okay. I'm not Chinese, so I don't eat dog. What'd you say,

778
00:48:04,680 --> 00:48:10,680
Yeah, well, I'm not... Wait, no, I don't know if it's Chinese that eats... I can't remember.

779
00:48:10,680 --> 00:48:13,680
Hello?

780
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:15,680
Eee, I can't reach the ferret.

781
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:17,680
Come in!

782
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:18,680
Hello!

783
00:48:18,680 --> 00:48:19,680
Hi!

784
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:24,680
Sharks Girl's here! Not by choice.

785
00:48:24,680 --> 00:48:25,680
Speak to our people.

786
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:28,680
Well, Sharks Girl, why don't you tell... We're all sitting around doing, how was your week, how was your day?

787
00:48:28,680 --> 00:48:31,680
Why don't you tell us, how was your week and how was your day?

788
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:37,920
Week sucked. Yesterday was good. Today was good until about what, 6 p.m.?

789
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:42,200
Then it has sucked balls from there on out and I want to say for the record

790
00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:44,040
Folsom sucks and has no cell phone reception.

791
00:48:44,040 --> 00:48:48,440
I get cell phone reception at my house. I've dropped like

792
00:48:48,440 --> 00:48:52,080
four times since I got off the 50.

793
00:48:52,080 --> 00:48:56,600
Ouch. Sorry. Okay.

794
00:48:56,600 --> 00:49:00,040
We're going to take a quick break and get back on track. We have a lot of

795
00:49:00,040 --> 00:49:02,300
money news we want to talk about here

796
00:49:02,300 --> 00:49:03,500
yeah there's a trip

797
00:49:03,500 --> 00:49:06,220
the track not in disneyland

798
00:49:06,220 --> 00:49:08,800
uh...

799
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:10,940
okay rob's going to hell

800
00:49:10,940 --> 00:49:13,940
the

801
00:49:13,940 --> 00:49:17,740
we're going to kick off this break with a brand new loki remix loki would you

802
00:49:17,740 --> 00:49:19,340
like to tell us about your mix

803
00:49:19,340 --> 00:49:20,720
and name on it

804
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:22,480
always got to change the name on it but

805
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:23,880
why you change the name tells

806
00:49:23,880 --> 00:49:26,380
tell something about the mix

807
00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:29,040
uh...

808
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:35,840
cool and stuff. No, I don't know. It was just, um, I needed something to mix together and

809
00:49:35,840 --> 00:49:45,760
this just kind of worked for some reason. So, yeah, it's, um, stoic, the big thunder

810
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:51,480
mountain mix. All right. This is Loki's brand newest remix. This is stoic, the big thunder

811
00:49:51,480 --> 00:49:58,960
mountain mix. You're on the brand is newest, not just brand is new, the brand is newest.

812
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:05,960
Here it is, Stoic, the big Thunder Mountain mix, here on Orange Lounge Radio.

813
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:38,960
music

814
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:48,960
music

815
00:51:48,960 --> 00:52:18,760
Hey, I like that.

816
00:52:18,760 --> 00:52:22,280
That was pretty cool. That was Stoic, the big Thunder Mountain mix. That was kind of

817
00:52:22,280 --> 00:52:28,400
neat. I have to agree with the chatroom. It kind of sounded a little bit like porn, but

818
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:34,000
it definitely choo-chooed along there. For once, he didn't use gravity. Let's give him

819
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:40,960
a hand first, staying away from gravity. Now you've got to do one that's not tack. I don't

820
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:46,520
know if you can do it. But I like the little bitsaholic there at the end, too. That was

821
00:52:46,520 --> 00:52:51,280
kind of cool. So that was nice. I like that. Good job. Anything, anybody want to say something

822
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:59,660
about it? Oh, okay. I think we'll go back to break because we got other people doing

823
00:52:59,660 --> 00:53:07,120
other errands or whatever. So we're going to play some more songs and we'll be back

824
00:53:07,120 --> 00:53:14,120
I've got the rhythm in my veins Can't wait to see what you've got

825
00:53:37,120 --> 00:53:40,320
You can find it every day, if you want

826
00:53:40,320 --> 00:53:43,720
And it's so well to take a shit

827
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:46,920
This game is ready and ready to play

828
00:53:46,920 --> 00:53:50,120
King of the night, he gives me all the time

829
00:53:50,120 --> 00:53:53,520
Walking on the fire, yes I'm burning

830
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:56,920
Dancing to the lights, the groove is just fine

831
00:53:56,920 --> 00:53:59,920
Don't stop the music, speed up the night

832
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:03,920
I wanna music, don't stop my imagination

833
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:05,920
To carry on

834
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:10,920
Leave me alone if I'm not right

835
00:55:10,920 --> 00:55:12,920
And why?

836
00:55:12,920 --> 00:55:15,920
Leave me alone so many days

837
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:19,920
Just to give you so many nights

838
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:24,920
Leave me alone if I'm not right

839
00:55:24,920 --> 00:55:26,920
Tell me why

840
00:55:26,920 --> 00:55:33,920
Now tell me why, now tell me why, now tell me why

841
00:57:56,920 --> 00:58:21,920
Music

842
00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:23,920
Listen to Orange Lounge Radio

843
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:28,160
Because Bongo demands it.

844
00:58:28,160 --> 00:58:31,000
Hello, and welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio.

845
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,660
And tomorrow, perfume, we heard in that break,

846
00:58:33,660 --> 00:58:35,660
which is kind of part of the Bamani news we've

847
00:58:35,660 --> 00:58:36,900
been hearing about this week.

848
00:58:36,900 --> 00:58:39,480
Is that a remedy to today's stink?

849
00:58:39,480 --> 00:58:43,160
Or as our resident comedian, Lanky Style, says in the chat room,

850
00:58:43,160 --> 00:58:46,680
have you heard the new DJ Taka song sampled for 2DX 10th style?

851
00:58:46,680 --> 00:58:50,320
It's called Yesterday Cologne.

852
00:58:50,320 --> 00:58:53,360
Mm, I like today's stink.

853
00:58:53,360 --> 00:59:00,140
That sounds like something I would have read on Moondabore's blog.

854
00:59:00,140 --> 00:59:04,460
All the fake Bomani news.

855
00:59:04,460 --> 00:59:09,180
I like today's musk.

856
00:59:09,180 --> 00:59:10,020
Anyway,

857
00:59:10,020 --> 00:59:13,960
the reason why that's kind of part of the Bomani news is that I guess

858
00:59:13,960 --> 00:59:17,340
I don't know how they do this. You're going to have to explain this again, Loki. I know you did.

859
00:59:17,340 --> 00:59:20,860
We went through this once before with Max 1 USA, if you can believe the show's

860
00:59:20,860 --> 00:59:22,300
been on the air that long.

861
00:59:22,300 --> 00:59:26,500
But I guess something to do with the demo disk, you hack

862
00:59:26,500 --> 00:59:29,220
the disk, and you see a master list of songs.

863
00:59:29,220 --> 00:59:32,060
And in that list of songs, we saw Tomorrow Perfume, which

864
00:59:32,060 --> 00:59:34,300
indicates Tomorrow Perfume will be an

865
00:59:34,300 --> 00:59:36,820
unlock in Max 2 USA.

866
00:59:36,820 --> 00:59:37,900
Or not.

867
00:59:37,900 --> 00:59:38,700
Or not.

868
00:59:38,700 --> 00:59:39,180
Or not.

869
00:59:39,180 --> 00:59:40,180
It may be.

870
00:59:40,180 --> 00:59:40,980
It may be.

871
00:59:40,980 --> 00:59:47,140
Because what happens is, and as this was explained by this

872
00:59:47,140 --> 00:59:50,980
guy on the boards called Dancer X, he explained that

873
00:59:50,980 --> 00:59:55,100
with every new home release, there's an updated master list of every single song that's ever

874
00:59:55,100 --> 01:00:03,180
been in DDR, pretty much, or so to say, everything that's pretty much in that version of the

875
01:00:03,180 --> 01:00:08,740
DDR engine or whatever. So, in this case, we're going to have, with this list, it's

876
01:00:08,740 --> 01:00:16,600
pretty much both what's going to be in Dancing Stage Fever and what's in, going to be in

877
01:00:16,600 --> 01:00:21,200
Max 2 USA because they both use the same engine, so it's hard to determine what's going to

878
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:25,640
be in what. But that was one of the songs that was mentioned in there along with More

879
01:00:25,640 --> 01:00:29,400
Deep from, I think, isn't that 2DX6 style or something like that?

880
01:00:29,400 --> 01:00:33,880
I saw, yeah. Yeah, that's going to be in there. But those

881
01:00:33,880 --> 01:00:38,880
are some of the ones that are supposed to be in there. There's another one, one of the

882
01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:44,560
ones that kind of grabbed people's attention was, and it's a really odd name, is called

883
01:00:44,560 --> 01:00:53,860
max and then there's a period after it. So I guess either it's just like max or max period.

884
01:00:53,860 --> 01:00:59,500
Was max unlimited also in the list? Yes, same with Legend of Max. Someone also thought it

885
01:00:59,500 --> 01:01:03,440
might be Paranoia Survivor Max but that was also in the list. Could the period just be

886
01:01:03,440 --> 01:01:10,840
funky Japanese writing? I don't know. It probably not because each song has a pretty much a

887
01:01:10,840 --> 01:01:17,640
a four letter ID for it. And so, it's not going to necessarily be funky writing. Like

888
01:01:17,640 --> 01:01:22,120
for instance, if it was like, you know, one of the Japanese songs, you know, like Freckles

889
01:01:22,120 --> 01:01:29,680
or whatever or, you know, something with Japanese writing, it would be spelled out in Romangi.

890
01:01:29,680 --> 01:01:34,560
Now because of this hacking of the disk, they've kind of had to go and reveal some things,

891
01:01:34,560 --> 01:01:39,520
some more things about DDR Max 2 USA. And I've always kind of hated this, I know something

892
01:01:39,520 --> 01:01:47,680
you don't know business about Max 2, I understand the desire to create like, I don't know what

893
01:01:47,680 --> 01:01:54,480
you'd call it, like people wanting to drool, not superiority, just wanting to surprise

894
01:01:54,480 --> 01:01:59,120
people or whatever, wanting to tease things and stuff like that. But you know, the guessing

895
01:01:59,120 --> 01:02:04,480
games and all that garbage, sometimes it kind of makes me wish they'd stay out of it. You

896
01:02:04,480 --> 01:02:05,840
You know what I mean?

897
01:02:05,840 --> 01:02:08,480
I don't know.

898
01:02:08,480 --> 01:02:11,120
I just don't like the whole fact that there's this whole,

899
01:02:11,120 --> 01:02:12,960
I know something you don't know attitude about a lot of

900
01:02:12,960 --> 01:02:16,680
this stuff, and it just makes me bitter.

901
01:02:16,680 --> 01:02:18,800
Anyway, here's what we do know.

902
01:02:18,800 --> 01:02:20,280
Here's what we've been told.

903
01:02:20,280 --> 01:02:23,240
When they hacked the disk, they tried to bring up the

904
01:02:23,240 --> 01:02:24,020
song samples.

905
01:02:24,020 --> 01:02:27,640
Because if you remember when the Max 1 disk was hacked,

906
01:02:27,640 --> 01:02:30,040
they were able to get song samples, and that's how they

907
01:02:30,040 --> 01:02:32,240
found that there was a drop to bomb remix on there, is that

908
01:02:32,240 --> 01:02:36,540
somebody hacked out the sound sample from the demo disc. Well, they got smarter this

909
01:02:36,540 --> 01:02:40,600
time and none of those samples are in there. It just had the four samples for the songs

910
01:02:40,600 --> 01:02:46,040
but it had a Midnight Blaze remix in there which has been revealed to be the information

911
01:02:46,040 --> 01:02:52,320
screen music. Whoop-a-doo. And for those who don't know, it's probably the same damn remix

912
01:02:52,320 --> 01:03:05,200
that was on the V-Rare CD with Max 2. Ooh, don't care. And then what else did we learn

913
01:03:05,200 --> 01:03:06,200
because of this?

914
01:03:06,200 --> 01:03:07,200
Feelings Won't Fade.

915
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:12,880
Feelings Won't Fade, that's another song that's going to be in there because, gee, did I call

916
01:03:12,880 --> 01:03:19,600
that before? Well, Feelings Won't Fade was the credit music in Max 2 Japanese, so I don't

917
01:03:19,600 --> 01:03:20,600
It just kind of makes sense.

918
01:03:20,600 --> 01:03:25,180
It's another System SF song and people like that, so whatever.

919
01:03:25,180 --> 01:03:29,000
What else do we hear about?

920
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:34,680
MAX-II US has a color-coded song system, meaning that kind of like how MAX-II Japan, you had

921
01:03:34,680 --> 01:03:37,060
all these different colors of songs in there.

922
01:03:37,060 --> 01:03:42,640
You had the new songs were one color, the old songs were another color, the ONI remixes

923
01:03:42,640 --> 01:03:43,640
were another color.

924
01:03:43,640 --> 01:03:45,680
They're going to do that as well with this.

925
01:03:45,680 --> 01:03:52,080
And so default songs are green, that are new to the US, 27 of them.

926
01:03:52,080 --> 01:03:54,600
Repeats US songs, because there was a few of those in there.

927
01:03:54,600 --> 01:03:58,100
I believe Shining Polaris is coming back, and there's a few others, I think, Silent

928
01:03:58,100 --> 01:04:00,340
Hills one.

929
01:04:00,340 --> 01:04:01,340
Repeats are blue.

930
01:04:01,340 --> 01:04:03,460
There's 13 repeats.

931
01:04:03,460 --> 01:04:08,340
Unlocks are yellow, and there's 20 unlocks, pretty good amount.

932
01:04:08,340 --> 01:04:12,340
Challenge step unlocks are purple, and there's seven of them.

933
01:04:12,340 --> 01:04:16,960
the special red unlocks, there's two of them, which, assumably, have been maxed, unlimited,

934
01:04:16,960 --> 01:04:23,720
and calculated. Yeah, pretty much. I don't know. I'm still, I don't believe that there's

935
01:04:23,720 --> 01:04:29,100
not the samples on the disk because they're lazy and stupid and they're gonna leave crap

936
01:04:29,100 --> 01:04:33,920
like that. They fuck up every single US mix ever made. Every single one's been fucked

937
01:04:33,920 --> 01:04:40,400
up in some way and lazy in some way as far as, you know, so I'm gonna look myself on

938
01:04:40,400 --> 01:04:45,440
in this disc to see if I can fight it. Just because they might have not found it the conventional

939
01:04:45,440 --> 01:04:54,440
way doesn't mean it's not still there. Burning heat's been confirmed, it's an unlock. What

940
01:04:54,440 --> 01:04:59,560
else did they confirm? Oh yes, the oni mode is not in the game. Oni mode will not be in

941
01:04:59,560 --> 01:05:06,040
the game. Nonstop, yes. Oni mode, no. I prefer nonstop. And in it's place, in oni mode's

942
01:05:06,040 --> 01:05:15,560
place will be challenge mode. Like the challenge on fourth mix type stuff? That's cool. That's

943
01:05:15,560 --> 01:05:18,440
what I heard is going to be the difference. They're going to have a challenge mode to

944
01:05:18,440 --> 01:05:25,600
unlock these things. And I like that better to be honest because I think Oni's are retarded.

945
01:05:25,600 --> 01:05:30,280
But that's what they're going to be doing I guess. Here's why Oni's are retarded and

946
01:05:30,280 --> 01:05:35,400
I'm glad they're staying in the arcade. Because playing on a home pad, you miss all the fucking

947
01:05:35,400 --> 01:05:40,940
time. It's just part of playing at home. I don't care if you have Ignition 59.0 or whatever

948
01:05:40,940 --> 01:05:46,480
dance pad that's top of the line. You still, it's not as good as the real hundreds and

949
01:05:46,480 --> 01:05:51,540
hundreds of dollars metal stage you play out on the arcade. Thank you. So nonstop was a

950
01:05:51,540 --> 01:05:52,540
better choice.

951
01:05:52,540 --> 01:05:53,620
Three John.

952
01:05:53,620 --> 01:05:58,380
But it's just weird that they have, now that explains it, Loki, because I had a question.

953
01:05:58,380 --> 01:06:03,600
How is it that they have the challenge step songs as unlocks when there's no Oni mode

954
01:06:03,600 --> 01:06:07,160
or challenge mode or whatever they're calling it in the US. That makes sense to me

955
01:06:07,160 --> 01:06:08,060
because I'm kinda like

956
01:06:08,060 --> 01:06:11,220
wait a minute, so you're not gonna have only mode but you're gonna have these only unlocked songs

957
01:06:11,220 --> 01:06:15,580
and you're gonna have, unless they go back and make basic trick and maniac steps

958
01:06:15,580 --> 01:06:16,980
which I doubt they will

959
01:06:16,980 --> 01:06:23,120
they're only gonna have one set of steps. Hopefully I'll be pleasantly

960
01:06:23,120 --> 01:06:25,860
surprised if somebody's gone back and made basic and trick steps

961
01:06:25,860 --> 01:06:30,220
because we all, I think we all can, we all have accepted that the challenge steps will just be

962
01:06:30,220 --> 01:06:31,020
the maniac steps.

963
01:06:31,020 --> 01:06:32,460
They can do it in five minutes.

964
01:06:32,460 --> 01:06:33,180
Loki can do it.

965
01:06:33,180 --> 01:06:36,460
Loki will come make steps for you.

966
01:06:36,460 --> 01:06:39,220
Well, no, what's sad is they have steps for a few songs,

967
01:06:39,220 --> 01:06:43,020
like, for instance, Hysteria 2001 and Before You, Before

968
01:06:43,020 --> 01:06:43,780
There's a Beat Mix.

969
01:06:43,780 --> 01:06:44,940
They're both in Euromix, too.

970
01:06:44,940 --> 01:06:48,380
They have their own basic and trick steps for it.

971
01:06:48,380 --> 01:06:53,780
They're just too lazy to put those over into the US mixes.

972
01:06:53,780 --> 01:06:55,100
It's sad.

973
01:06:55,100 --> 01:06:56,060
We think.

974
01:06:56,060 --> 01:06:58,060
We speculate to this point.

975
01:06:58,060 --> 01:06:59,540
We won't know for sure until September 24.

976
01:06:59,540 --> 01:07:06,540
I'm still not making a comment.

977
01:07:06,540 --> 01:07:07,460
I'm still

978
01:07:07,460 --> 01:07:11,660
going on record saying I'm supporting whatever Konami is going to do.

979
01:07:11,660 --> 01:07:13,180
Officially supporting.

980
01:07:13,180 --> 01:07:14,820
I'll have the game.

981
01:07:14,820 --> 01:07:18,920
I don't think there's any doubt that any of us, that we're going to buy the

982
01:07:18,920 --> 01:07:20,500
game. It will be

983
01:07:20,500 --> 01:07:24,260
it'll be the best mix to date, home release to date. There's no doubt about

984
01:07:24,260 --> 01:07:25,220
that.

985
01:07:25,220 --> 01:07:27,400
So we all know that MaxUSA

986
01:07:27,400 --> 01:07:31,060
blew everything else out of the way. It blew Max Japan out of the water. I'm sorry. I don't

987
01:07:31,060 --> 01:07:36,460
care what you think about the Japanese. It was superior in every way to Max Japan. And

988
01:07:36,460 --> 01:07:40,980
Max 2 USA will probably be superior in every way to Max Japan. But as rabid fans, we're

989
01:07:40,980 --> 01:07:49,980
going to bitch about everything that wasn't done the way we wanted it to. So, that being

990
01:07:49,980 --> 01:07:55,820
said, I believe that covers everything that's been confirmed this week for Max 2 USA. Do

991
01:07:55,820 --> 01:07:57,120
Do we know any more of those songs?

992
01:07:57,120 --> 01:07:58,680
I was trying to find that list of songs

993
01:07:58,680 --> 01:07:59,960
that were found in the hacks.

994
01:07:59,960 --> 01:08:02,040
I know one that kind of struck me as interesting

995
01:08:02,040 --> 01:08:04,580
was Don't Call Me Baby by Madison Avenue,

996
01:08:04,580 --> 01:08:07,000
because I haven't seen that announced for either game yet.

997
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:09,200
So it's an unlock in one of the games.

998
01:08:09,200 --> 01:08:11,000
More than likely, probably, the European one,

999
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:13,280
because I don't think they have as much of the European lists

1000
01:08:13,280 --> 01:08:13,960
to do this one.

1001
01:08:17,600 --> 01:08:22,680
So some of the other ones, I think, were in there.

1002
01:08:22,680 --> 01:08:24,400
I'm trying to look up the list here.

1003
01:08:24,400 --> 01:08:29,280
I think Turn the Beat Around was another one, maybe, or Saturday Night Fever or something

1004
01:08:29,280 --> 01:08:30,280
like that.

1005
01:08:30,280 --> 01:08:35,760
There was one that was an old school song that I just can't remember which one it was.

1006
01:08:35,760 --> 01:08:36,960
There's a bunch of stuff on there.

1007
01:08:36,960 --> 01:08:43,240
There's another Spice Girls song in there, I think.

1008
01:08:43,240 --> 01:08:50,000
But that's obviously going to be friggin' European, so yay!

1009
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,000
Don't care.

1010
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:58,440
Anyway, that's the big Bahmani news this week.

1011
01:08:58,440 --> 01:09:02,080
I haven't really heard of anything else going on in the Bahmani world this week.

1012
01:09:02,080 --> 01:09:05,080
Anybody know anything interesting going on otherwise?

1013
01:09:05,080 --> 01:09:07,080
Not that I've noticed.

1014
01:09:07,080 --> 01:09:08,080
What?

1015
01:09:08,080 --> 01:09:09,640
I haven't really noticed anything.

1016
01:09:09,640 --> 01:09:13,160
I think that the only activity is going on over here.

1017
01:09:13,160 --> 01:09:14,160
What?

1018
01:09:14,160 --> 01:09:15,160
The Max2USA?

1019
01:09:15,160 --> 01:09:18,680
Yeah, I think that's really the only thing going on.

1020
01:09:18,680 --> 01:09:23,280
We have Extreme in Japan coming out in October, but I think we all kind of know what to expect,

1021
01:09:23,280 --> 01:09:26,480
because the Japanese ones, we always know what to expect, because they're going to be

1022
01:09:26,480 --> 01:09:28,560
just like the arcade ones, pretty much.

1023
01:09:28,560 --> 01:09:32,920
It's just the song list is always a question, and what's going to be an unlock, and hopefully

1024
01:09:32,920 --> 01:09:35,280
Extreme Japan doesn't suck.

1025
01:09:35,280 --> 01:09:39,700
There's a lot of people always already kind of pushing it and selling it as it's going

1026
01:09:39,700 --> 01:09:42,080
to be the best home release yet.

1027
01:09:42,080 --> 01:09:44,280
It's going to be even better than Max 2 USA.

1028
01:09:44,280 --> 01:09:47,140
Personally, I doubt it's going to be better than Max 2 USA.

1029
01:09:47,140 --> 01:09:50,320
I just, Extreme just sucked for me.

1030
01:09:50,320 --> 01:09:51,320
Even the arcade version.

1031
01:09:51,320 --> 01:09:57,100
I mean, sure, it had an assload of songs, but not that many new, new, new, new songs.

1032
01:09:57,100 --> 01:09:59,460
Just a bunch of recycled shit from other games.

1033
01:09:59,460 --> 01:10:03,720
I actually say that Extreme got me back into playing DDR.

1034
01:10:03,720 --> 01:10:07,500
I think Extreme scared me away from DDR.

1035
01:10:07,500 --> 01:10:09,020
I'm not a big fan of Extreme.

1036
01:10:09,020 --> 01:10:13,220
I think, honestly, when it all said and done, I think I'm just really bitter at the fact

1037
01:10:13,220 --> 01:10:16,220
that the Dance Mania tracks were...

1038
01:10:16,220 --> 01:10:20,020
was like what seven of them licensed and they weren't that great there was maybe

1039
01:10:20,020 --> 01:10:24,260
two good ones out of the whole bunch and just I like it for playing all the old

1040
01:10:24,260 --> 01:10:29,220
stuff yeah I don't know it's half the time I go there I didn't played stuff

1041
01:10:29,220 --> 01:10:34,380
from 2dx or sort of a solo if I want to play a 2dx song I'm gonna play 2dx I

1042
01:10:34,380 --> 01:10:38,980
don't I don't like dancing the a it's kind of stupid well then don't play a I

1043
01:10:38,980 --> 01:10:45,040
don't mean I don't dance to be either the only 2dx songs like a holic every

1044
01:10:45,040 --> 01:10:46,240
Every time I play.

1045
01:10:46,240 --> 01:10:48,560
I play stoic.

1046
01:10:48,560 --> 01:10:49,560
That's kind of fun to dance to.

1047
01:10:49,560 --> 01:10:55,680
It has interesting steps that are challenging, but it's a whole extreme.

1048
01:10:55,680 --> 01:10:58,760
What's weird is I actually have been getting back into DDR more lately.

1049
01:10:58,760 --> 01:11:02,800
I've been playing a little more DDR lately, but it's been any machine I can find really.

1050
01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:04,000
It's not just extreme.

1051
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:05,800
I played fourth plus yesterday.

1052
01:11:05,800 --> 01:11:10,420
I had a ball until I almost killed myself playing too many hard songs.

1053
01:11:10,420 --> 01:11:13,000
That's what I get for being out of shape, by the way.

1054
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:16,420
I play a bunch of catastrophes back to back and I almost have an asthma attack in the

1055
01:11:16,420 --> 01:11:19,180
military arcade.

1056
01:11:19,180 --> 01:11:23,100
But I'll just have to practice more often.

1057
01:11:23,100 --> 01:11:26,300
Here's some of the songs that were on there.

1058
01:11:26,300 --> 01:11:27,480
Some of the new ones on the list.

1059
01:11:27,480 --> 01:11:31,500
Come on Eileen, Groove is in the Heart, Stayin' Alive.

1060
01:11:31,500 --> 01:11:32,500
That was the one.

1061
01:11:32,500 --> 01:11:37,040
I was thinking of Stayin' Alive, Get Down Tonight.

1062
01:11:37,040 --> 01:11:38,440
Then they have, of course, Take Me Away.

1063
01:11:38,440 --> 01:11:40,200
That's one of the ones.

1064
01:11:40,200 --> 01:11:46,320
A Stupid Barber, Teenage Kicks, Scorching Moon, A Little Bit of Ecstasy, All That She

1065
01:11:46,320 --> 01:11:54,080
Wants, Ace of Base, Of Course Heaven, Cool For Cats, Jump Around, One Step Beyond, The

1066
01:11:54,080 --> 01:12:00,320
Boys Are Back in Town, 20-20 Vision, Dizzy, Virtuality, Music, The Bowstick Remix, which

1067
01:12:00,320 --> 01:12:05,140
is by Darude, and then of course Busy Child and Feelings Won't Fade. Those are the new

1068
01:12:05,140 --> 01:12:12,220
licensed songs. Bad Routine was another one that was in there, and More Deep version.21,

1069
01:12:12,220 --> 01:12:13,220
or whatever.

1070
01:12:13,220 --> 01:12:17,500
I want someone to do a routine to Bad Routine.

1071
01:12:17,500 --> 01:12:22,160
And Keep on Lifting from last time. Remember how I said Keep on Lifting? No Nemesis, makes

1072
01:12:22,160 --> 01:12:23,160
me sad.

1073
01:12:23,160 --> 01:12:28,620
Yeah, no Nemesis. What happened there? Nemesis would be kind of... It's not a dance song.

1074
01:12:28,620 --> 01:12:34,500
I'm sorry. Whoever cut that, it was a good idea. I hope they put something else in this

1075
01:12:34,500 --> 01:12:46,700
Max period. Who knows? I think it's just something to screw with people. I think it's just something

1076
01:12:46,700 --> 01:12:47,700
to screw with people.

1077
01:12:47,700 --> 01:12:48,700
Maybe it's just a placeholder.

1078
01:12:48,700 --> 01:12:53,900
I think it's a... I don't think it means shit. Maybe it's something for challenge mode. Who

1079
01:12:53,900 --> 01:12:54,900
knows?

1080
01:12:54,900 --> 01:12:59,460
But that would be cool if it wasn't. Yes. Yes, it would be.

1081
01:13:29,460 --> 01:13:35,060
best DDR game yet. It's got nothing but licensed songs from all these decades of music. It's

1082
01:13:35,060 --> 01:13:41,660
got the fucking Spice Girls. That's rad. But the weirdest thing about it is that it's

1083
01:13:41,660 --> 01:13:50,980
for the PS2 and PS1. I find that very strange that they made a version for each system.

1084
01:13:50,980 --> 01:13:53,940
So do you think they'll run off different engines or something? Or what do you think

1085
01:13:53,940 --> 01:13:58,300
will happen? I bet you the CD one won't have the videos, obviously. It'll probably be a

1086
01:13:58,300 --> 01:14:02,300
to be a fifth mix. Pretty much. I think it's going to be fifth mix engine and you're going

1087
01:14:02,300 --> 01:14:08,780
to have the other one that's just, I don't know, probably just max two obviously. But

1088
01:14:08,780 --> 01:14:14,260
because it's a PS1 version, I can import that because I have a modded, you know, PlayStation

1089
01:14:14,260 --> 01:14:25,540
stuff. That'd be cool. You're special. Okay. Any, why don't you tell us about what's going

1090
01:14:55,540 --> 01:15:01,580
huge dance song here. I guess the question would be, somebody's got to determine where

1091
01:15:01,580 --> 01:15:04,760
they're really licensing these songs from and you could probably figure it out with

1092
01:15:04,760 --> 01:15:09,540
the record companies involved in everything. Like, what, EuroMix II had stuff licensed

1093
01:15:09,540 --> 01:15:16,820
from Zomba, right? But it was never really said where the licenses from the last Max

1094
01:15:16,820 --> 01:15:23,500
USA was coming from. SyFam, but Sandstorm's not a SyFam song, so there's somebody else

1095
01:15:23,500 --> 01:15:34,380
involved too. So, who knows? Who knows? Please put my song in DVR. I need exposure.

1096
01:15:34,380 --> 01:15:37,780
Maybe that. Maybe, in the case of Steve Reiner. But hey,

1097
01:15:37,780 --> 01:15:40,860
Dark Black Forest, I know a lot of people think it's played out.

1098
01:15:40,860 --> 01:15:44,180
It's the most annoying song ever. Whatever. I totally disagree. I think it was

1099
01:15:44,180 --> 01:15:47,020
the best licensed song they had in Max USA, and I think it's awesome.

1100
01:15:47,020 --> 01:15:51,260
I would like Sandstorm better. If I had to admit, their cover for Dancing

1101
01:15:51,260 --> 01:15:54,260
This age figure is pretty gay.

1102
01:15:54,260 --> 01:15:57,580
It's really retarded.

1103
01:15:57,580 --> 01:16:00,100
I want to set that girl on fire.

1104
01:16:00,100 --> 01:16:01,740
Anyway, we'll be back.

1105
01:16:01,740 --> 01:16:04,300
And I think I played this song last week, but I don't care

1106
01:16:04,300 --> 01:16:05,580
because the song rules.

1107
01:16:05,580 --> 01:16:09,060
And Jamie wanted to hear more DDR songs tonight, so I'm

1108
01:16:09,060 --> 01:16:10,540
going to play a DDR song I want to hear.

1109
01:16:10,540 --> 01:16:12,740
And it's going to be in Max 2 USA, and that is good.

1110
01:16:12,740 --> 01:16:13,740
Okay.

1111
01:17:42,740 --> 01:18:08,860
You got an easy day, you got an easy day

1112
01:18:08,860 --> 01:18:11,180
Someone call me, call me

1113
01:18:11,180 --> 01:18:14,340
Shizuka in a room, there in the city

1114
01:18:14,340 --> 01:18:17,540
So I'll take you to the north of me

1115
01:18:17,540 --> 01:18:20,740
You've got a busy day, you've got a busy day

1116
01:18:20,740 --> 01:18:23,220
I kill a man, you're all alone

1117
01:18:23,220 --> 01:18:26,180
You do that, get the hug, you do that on your own

1118
01:18:26,180 --> 01:18:29,020
You can't sit here, dashing in

1119
01:18:29,020 --> 01:18:32,340
All that you do is tell me

1120
01:18:32,340 --> 01:18:35,260
That I love you, can't let go of me

1121
01:18:35,260 --> 01:18:37,540
But no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

1122
01:18:37,540 --> 01:18:41,540
Yeah, ooh, tell ya, you got the moves

1123
01:18:41,540 --> 01:18:44,540
You can't lie down, no, don't go down

1124
01:18:44,540 --> 01:18:47,540
So go ahead and make me shine

1125
01:18:47,540 --> 01:18:50,540
Come on, come on, rockin' like a song

1126
01:18:50,540 --> 01:18:53,540
Can you meet on the count of money on it?

1127
01:18:53,540 --> 01:18:55,540
Yeah, so me and you go and you can't

1128
01:18:55,540 --> 01:18:59,540
Can you meet on the count of money on it?

1129
01:18:59,540 --> 01:19:02,540
Jesus knows I'm ready for the way down

1130
01:20:59,540 --> 01:21:15,540
Please listen to Orange Lounge Radio because real radio makes Captain Jack cry.

1131
01:21:15,540 --> 01:21:27,940
Hello everybody and welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio episode.59.

1132
01:21:27,940 --> 01:21:33,620
We're back after some discussion on Max2USA and How Was Your Week, How Was Your Day.

1133
01:21:33,620 --> 01:21:37,180
Shark Skrull's been gone for what, about 30 minutes now I'd say?

1134
01:21:37,180 --> 01:21:38,180
Not that long.

1135
01:21:38,180 --> 01:21:39,180
Not that long?

1136
01:21:39,180 --> 01:21:43,020
Where in the world is Melody?

1137
01:21:43,020 --> 01:21:44,460
At my house probably.

1138
01:21:44,460 --> 01:21:47,780
I'm not funny at all today, I understand that.

1139
01:21:47,780 --> 01:21:52,100
And our anti-funny is Rob.

1140
01:21:52,100 --> 01:22:02,340
You are a, yeah, my anti-fun is wrong. Anyway, Loki, how about a sim update, sir? Oh, you

1141
01:22:02,340 --> 01:22:12,860
want me to do stuff? Okay. But anyways, let's see, StepMania came out with Beta 4 Alpha

1142
01:22:12,860 --> 01:22:19,380
4, I don't know what the fuck they're on now. I think it's like Alpha 4 Beta something.

1143
01:22:49,380 --> 01:22:53,100
Real much going on other than, you know, tons of SIM files coming out.

1144
01:22:53,100 --> 01:22:57,820
Shoei released another part of the DDR SIM file history collection.

1145
01:22:58,300 --> 01:23:05,300
More files from sites you've never heard of and other than that, like I said, not too much.

1146
01:23:05,380 --> 01:23:10,720
Pretty much if you're looking for SIM files, there are a couple places you can go.

1147
01:23:10,720 --> 01:23:14,820
Go to DDR Maniacs and check out in the community news section,

1148
01:23:14,820 --> 01:23:21,620
there's something about the sim file DC hub, that's direct connect hub. You'll find a bunch

1149
01:23:21,620 --> 01:23:26,840
of people in there with thousands of files that you can go leech off of. Also, there's

1150
01:23:26,840 --> 01:23:32,420
going to be, you know, Bamai style which you can find a bunch of cool stuff there. And

1151
01:23:32,420 --> 01:23:38,180
then you can also get on your, off your ass and go do some searches on the internet and

1152
01:23:38,180 --> 01:23:45,280
find your damn files yourself, you lazy bastard. So, ha, I have to laugh about, oh yeah, there's

1153
01:23:45,280 --> 01:23:50,000
some thing going on with DDR Freak about getting official SIM file collections because, you

1154
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:53,720
know, no one has them anymore except for me and, you know, they can go fuck themselves

1155
01:23:53,720 --> 01:24:02,400
because, not DDR Freak but the project. The project that just happens to be on DDR Freak

1156
01:24:02,400 --> 01:24:06,640
Because, you know, I'm not sharing.

1157
01:24:06,640 --> 01:24:11,800
So, what have we established? A, you're a pirate. R, and B, you're a selfish pirate.

1158
01:24:11,800 --> 01:24:13,840
R, walk me plank.

1159
01:24:13,840 --> 01:24:16,200
You butt-head, you need to be kicked.

1160
01:24:16,200 --> 01:24:19,900
Why? Someone never spanked you when you were little.

1161
01:24:19,900 --> 01:24:23,600
No, but I think she's taking, I think, uh, you know who's taking care of that now

1162
01:24:23,600 --> 01:24:25,240
that, you know, Loki's twenty,

1163
01:24:25,240 --> 01:24:27,320
in his twenties and all.

1164
01:24:27,320 --> 01:24:29,720
I don't get spanked from her.

1165
01:24:29,720 --> 01:24:33,060
Not from her, but, you know, your girlfriend.

1166
01:24:33,060 --> 01:24:34,580
I don't get spanked from her.

1167
01:24:34,580 --> 01:24:35,800
Never?

1168
01:24:35,800 --> 01:24:37,040
Never!

1169
01:24:37,040 --> 01:24:39,040
You guys are boring.

1170
01:24:39,040 --> 01:24:43,280
Hello! TMI alert, thank you.

1171
01:24:43,280 --> 01:24:46,940
No, I mean, like, literally, like, kick his butt a few times.

1172
01:24:46,940 --> 01:24:52,500
Uh-huh, nice recovery. Oh, he's into the rough stuff.

1173
01:24:52,500 --> 01:24:58,840
You know, men need women to keep them in line.

1174
01:24:58,840 --> 01:25:03,000
Not for us, you guys would just fuck this planet up.

1175
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:04,560
Sure.

1176
01:25:04,560 --> 01:25:08,280
You know, because all those crazy women drivers out there causing accidents,

1177
01:25:08,280 --> 01:25:10,440
tying up our freaking highways and byways.

1178
01:25:10,440 --> 01:25:13,340
Hey, I'm a good driver.

1179
01:25:13,340 --> 01:25:15,840
Yeah.

1180
01:25:15,840 --> 01:25:19,200
Just give me an evil look.

1181
01:25:19,200 --> 01:25:24,560
You are so dead when I'm over my sick.

1182
01:25:24,560 --> 01:25:25,280
You know what?

1183
01:25:25,280 --> 01:25:26,080
You can't hurt me.

1184
01:25:26,080 --> 01:25:27,880
I have the power of plane crashes.

1185
01:25:27,880 --> 01:25:31,960
You're going to catch multiple infection disease from her if you're not careful.

1186
01:25:31,960 --> 01:25:35,160
You know what? I'm immune. Oh my god, Jamie, how's the SARS?

1187
01:25:35,160 --> 01:25:38,560
I do not have SARS. It's monkey pox. I'm immune.

1188
01:25:38,560 --> 01:25:42,280
Oh my god. I heard that SARS was coming back. Like, it was a big thing on Yahoo.

1189
01:25:42,280 --> 01:25:47,360
Hey, be it, you know, it's like, it's like, it's like leaf garret, okay? All of a sudden, SARS

1190
01:25:47,360 --> 01:25:48,600
making a comeback, right?

1191
01:25:48,600 --> 01:25:52,600
And, I, what if you have SARS, Jamie? I don't have SARS.

1192
01:25:52,600 --> 01:25:56,120
How do you know? I've never been to China.

1193
01:25:56,120 --> 01:25:59,120
Have you been in contact with any Canadians lately?

1194
01:26:00,120 --> 01:26:02,120
Namely in the Toronto area?

1195
01:26:03,120 --> 01:26:05,120
Is Marin Chan the secretly Canadian?

1196
01:26:06,120 --> 01:26:08,120
Oh my God, my spinners are coming from Toronto.

1197
01:26:09,120 --> 01:26:10,120
They're probably laced with SARS.

1198
01:26:11,120 --> 01:26:12,120
Oh my God, they're SARS infested spinners.

1199
01:26:13,120 --> 01:26:14,120
You can shut up.

1200
01:26:16,120 --> 01:26:21,120
Okay, before we get killed, I think now's a good time to get into the Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match.

1201
01:26:22,120 --> 01:26:24,120
I'm ready for the fuck yous of the week.

1202
01:26:24,120 --> 01:26:50,120
I still think this song is still my word.

1203
01:26:54,120 --> 01:27:03,960
called Face the Change, and it's remixed by Dirt Devils and Above and Beyond, very cool.

1204
01:27:03,960 --> 01:27:09,420
They do a lot of great remixes. They did Madonna's What it Feels Like for a Girl video remix,

1205
01:27:09,420 --> 01:27:13,620
and they also did M, Yumi Hamasaki's M, which is a great sim file.

1206
01:27:13,620 --> 01:27:19,220
Alright, here it is, last week's winner, and this first song you can vote for in the Orange

1210
01:27:35,200 --> 01:27:40,540
one. This is Every Little Thing, Cyber Trance with Face the Change, Dirt Devils and Above

1211
01:27:40,540 --> 01:27:44,020
and Beyond Remix. And you only hear a clip of it because it won last week. Here it is.

1212
01:27:44,020 --> 01:27:53,120
See you all in the next video!

1213
01:28:14,020 --> 01:28:16,020
Oh

1214
01:29:14,020 --> 01:29:43,780
Oops, dead air, sorry.

1215
01:29:43,780 --> 01:29:44,780
Sorry.

1216
01:29:44,780 --> 01:29:45,780
Good air.

1217
01:29:45,780 --> 01:29:46,780
My bad.

1218
01:29:46,780 --> 01:29:50,780
You want to take the next song, Jamie, or you want me to?

1219
01:29:50,780 --> 01:29:51,780
Why not?

1220
01:29:51,780 --> 01:29:52,780
You're going to do it?

1221
01:29:52,780 --> 01:29:53,780
Yeah, why not?

1222
01:29:53,780 --> 01:29:54,780
Are you okay?

1223
01:29:54,780 --> 01:29:55,780
I'm having a nap.

1224
01:29:55,780 --> 01:29:56,780
You sound sleepy.

1225
01:29:56,780 --> 01:29:57,780
I'm taking a nap.

1226
01:29:57,780 --> 01:29:58,780
Okay.

1227
01:29:58,780 --> 01:30:01,780
Well, before you nap, tell us about your song pick for this week.

1228
01:30:01,780 --> 01:30:04,780
It's a remix of Tori Amos' Sugar.

1229
01:30:04,780 --> 01:30:05,780
I'm so proud of Jamie.

1230
01:30:05,780 --> 01:30:07,780
She picked Tori Amos this week.

1231
01:30:07,780 --> 01:30:08,780
Okay.

1232
01:30:08,780 --> 01:30:11,780
It's a good song, and it sounds all dark and depressed.

1233
01:30:11,780 --> 01:30:15,780
This is a dark and depressing trance remix of Tori Amos with Sugar.

1234
01:30:15,780 --> 01:30:18,620
This is song number two you can vote for tonight.

1235
01:30:18,620 --> 01:30:19,620
Dark sacrifice pick.

1236
01:30:19,620 --> 01:30:20,620
Here it is.

1237
01:30:20,620 --> 01:30:21,620
The whole song.

1238
01:30:21,620 --> 01:30:49,620
Don't fight me, I'm not strong Don't save me, I'm too weak

1239
01:30:49,620 --> 01:30:51,620
I'll be there

1240
01:30:54,620 --> 01:30:56,620
Do you like the day?

1241
01:30:56,620 --> 01:30:58,620
Do you like the night?

1242
01:30:58,620 --> 01:31:00,620
Do you like the sun?

1243
01:31:00,620 --> 01:31:02,620
Do you like the day?

1244
01:31:07,620 --> 01:31:09,620
Shilla

1245
01:31:39,620 --> 01:31:43,620
Get in with them

1246
01:31:49,620 --> 01:31:54,620
And sugar, bring me sugar

1247
01:31:57,620 --> 01:32:00,620
And all the ramen free

1248
01:32:01,620 --> 01:32:05,620
Bring me many things for sugar

1249
01:32:05,620 --> 01:32:08,620
You bring me up

1250
01:32:11,620 --> 01:32:14,620
As far as I can tell

1251
01:32:15,620 --> 01:32:18,620
I've been too young to fall

1252
01:32:18,620 --> 01:32:21,620
Just in my heart tonight

1253
01:32:24,620 --> 01:32:28,620
If you were that good

1254
01:32:29,620 --> 01:32:32,620
I don't know me

1255
01:32:32,620 --> 01:32:39,620
And I'm the one you know, you say you found me out

1256
01:33:02,620 --> 01:33:19,740
You bring me sugar, you bring me sugar You know I'd rather bring you, you bring me

1257
01:33:19,740 --> 01:33:23,740
They bring many things but sugar

1258
01:33:24,740 --> 01:33:27,740
It brings me sugar

1259
01:33:29,740 --> 01:33:32,740
And all the rotten things

1260
01:33:33,740 --> 01:33:37,740
They bring many things but sugar

1261
01:33:37,740 --> 01:33:40,740
I wish you love

1262
01:33:48,740 --> 01:33:51,740
I wish you love

1263
01:33:51,740 --> 01:33:53,740
tonight

1264
01:33:53,740 --> 01:33:55,740
tonight

1265
01:34:55,740 --> 01:35:02,740
Okay, that was Tori Amos with Sugar, the trance remix.

1266
01:35:25,740 --> 01:35:28,380
uh... lucky

1267
01:35:28,380 --> 01:35:29,980
and i it was

1268
01:35:29,980 --> 01:35:31,820
mellow

1269
01:35:31,820 --> 01:35:36,020
give it a seven

1270
01:35:36,020 --> 01:35:37,860
i'd reach where you can do no wrong

1271
01:35:37,860 --> 01:35:39,020
uh...

1272
01:35:39,020 --> 01:35:41,520
it's it sounds like a fan remix to me

1273
01:35:41,520 --> 01:35:45,320
i don't know if it sounds a little love

1274
01:35:45,320 --> 01:35:48,380
and what i was a little beyond all it's just what i would like you a little

1275
01:35:48,380 --> 01:35:53,540
agree he was thinking about also look for but it's pretty damn well done

1276
01:35:53,540 --> 01:35:58,960
I can't see myself giving it a ten for some reason, but a nine. Nine and a half, even.

1277
01:35:58,960 --> 01:36:03,460
I do really like that. That was very good. And Tory is the shit.

1278
01:36:03,460 --> 01:36:08,040
I would be a horrible gay man if I were to give Tory a low score.

1279
01:36:08,040 --> 01:36:09,360
Anyway...

1280
01:36:09,360 --> 01:36:10,960
I love that the remix fit the song.

1281
01:36:10,960 --> 01:36:14,860
It does. It does really fit the song. Have you heard the original of that song?

1282
01:36:14,860 --> 01:36:16,360
Not in a very long time.

1283
01:36:16,360 --> 01:36:21,520
Yeah, the remix fits it very well, so whoever remixed that did a damn good job.

1284
01:36:21,520 --> 01:36:22,920
I would not be sad if that won at all.

1285
01:36:22,920 --> 01:36:25,360
I actually like all of tonight's cage match songs.

1286
01:36:25,360 --> 01:36:27,880
Usually there's one I'm kind of like, eh, hope it doesn't win, but tonight, I don't

1287
01:36:27,880 --> 01:36:28,880
care what wins.

1288
01:36:28,880 --> 01:36:29,880
They're all good.

1289
01:36:29,880 --> 01:36:33,880
So, my pick, song number three, now I knew that Loki won last week.

1290
01:36:33,880 --> 01:36:34,880
He had a trance song.

1291
01:36:34,880 --> 01:36:37,120
I knew Jamie was bringing a trance mix.

1292
01:36:37,120 --> 01:36:42,800
So usually when, you know, I know of trance, that there's going to be two trance songs

1293
01:36:42,800 --> 01:36:46,120
and I try to do something different, like crazy, like I'll do something really like

1294
01:36:46,120 --> 01:36:48,320
stupid crazy.

1295
01:36:48,320 --> 01:36:53,080
usually that ends up being a Kylie Minogue song of some sort but tonight I

1296
01:36:53,080 --> 01:36:59,240
thought you know what I don't really want to play Kylie Minogue. Yeah how dare you put Kylie against Tori. Tori would up and kick her ass.

1297
01:36:59,240 --> 01:37:03,940
No so I thought I'm not gonna put in Kylie Minogue instead I'm gonna put in

1298
01:37:03,940 --> 01:37:09,360
her sister Danny Minogue because Danny Minogue is starting a singing career so I'm

1299
01:37:09,360 --> 01:37:13,920
gonna put in a song by her. This is Danny Minogue with Put the Needle on it

1300
01:37:13,920 --> 01:37:17,520
the Jason Nevins ultra pop radio edit and I heard this last night at the club

1301
01:37:17,520 --> 01:37:24,520
and I liked it a lot, so it's my entry for tonight's cage match. Here it is, enjoy.

1302
01:37:47,520 --> 01:37:52,520
I got the place, you got the time, I'm just gettin' my list, did I make you blush?

1303
01:37:52,520 --> 01:38:00,520
I let you in, switch in, the temperature is rising so hot, I may wanna take my clothes off

1304
01:38:00,520 --> 01:38:07,520
You trip inside, you trip inside, let the music make you rise up

1305
01:38:07,520 --> 01:38:14,520
Dirty hand is what I demand, let the music make you rise up

1306
01:40:44,520 --> 01:41:08,640
Dirty hands, I demand Dirty hands, I demand

1307
01:41:08,640 --> 01:41:15,640
uh...

1308
01:41:17,920 --> 01:41:20,320
already a song of the three

1309
01:41:20,320 --> 01:41:22,280
danny minnow put them you want it

1310
01:41:22,280 --> 01:41:23,840
jason evans makes jamie

1311
01:41:23,840 --> 01:41:25,960
it's good for kylie's good for danny

1312
01:41:25,960 --> 01:41:27,800
it's got to be better

1313
01:41:27,800 --> 01:41:30,520
uh... it wasn't that they get sick

1314
01:41:30,520 --> 01:41:33,840
okay

1315
01:41:33,840 --> 01:41:37,000
i'd like to give it a

1316
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:41,000
You actually told me I had I played like four of them for you and you said that was the best one. I agree

1317
01:41:41,000 --> 01:41:45,540
I like them in my opinion. That's the best one. The remix is awesome. It's it's porno

1318
01:41:45,540 --> 01:41:50,760
It makes me want to do lap dances and pixie dust slap and tug under Kylie underwear

1319
01:41:52,420 --> 01:41:54,420
I'm gonna get killed for that. I

1320
01:41:55,780 --> 01:41:57,780
Like that's not a lie. Give it a night

1321
01:41:58,180 --> 01:42:02,380
So there you go. Those are your three picks for tonight. So here they are

1331
01:42:22,540 --> 01:42:25,380
In case you forgot, here they are again.

1332
01:42:25,380 --> 01:42:30,140
First off, last week's winner, Every Little Thing, Cyber Trance, Face the Change.

1333
01:42:30,140 --> 01:42:39,560
All right, song number two you can vote for tonight.

1334
01:42:39,560 --> 01:42:52,960
Tori Amos with Sugar, the trance remix.

1335
01:42:52,960 --> 01:42:56,960
And of course, song number three, Danny Minow with Put the Needle On It, the Jason Evans mix.

1336
01:43:04,960 --> 01:43:07,960
All right. There you go. Place votes now.

1337
01:43:08,960 --> 01:43:11,960
You know what? I think it's time to rant.

1338
01:43:12,960 --> 01:43:17,960
Not like the FUs of the Week because our chat room has to respond to that too, and they can't do that while they're voting.

1339
01:43:18,960 --> 01:43:20,960
What now, Jamie? Just kidding.

1340
01:43:20,960 --> 01:43:35,960
I love you. Hi. Hi. I'm ranting about retarded people. I just know so you can see my construction

1341
01:43:35,960 --> 01:43:44,480
table on the webcam. That's pretty cool. Let her rant. Don't rant about retarded people.

1342
01:43:44,480 --> 01:43:48,960
They can't help it. I'm talking about people who aren't retarded but act retarded. Oh,

1343
01:43:48,960 --> 01:43:57,040
Okay, just people who have like, people need to go to school before they're allowed on

1344
01:43:57,040 --> 01:43:58,040
the internet.

1345
01:43:58,040 --> 01:44:02,880
And I mean go to school and actually pass like grammar and spelling before they're allowed

1346
01:44:02,880 --> 01:44:03,880
on the internet.

1347
01:44:03,880 --> 01:44:08,400
People need, I think, you know, I was reading on my mailing list for J-list how there's

1348
01:44:08,400 --> 01:44:13,200
like a test for everything in Japan, you know, like your fluency levels, there's a test to

1349
01:44:13,200 --> 01:44:17,080
play baseball good enough, there's tests for everything.

1350
01:44:17,080 --> 01:44:21,680
They need to have tests for everything here where like you have to have a certain level

1351
01:44:21,680 --> 01:44:27,200
of proficiency before you're allowed to breathe or maybe not that extreme.

1352
01:44:27,560 --> 01:44:32,640
But like, you know, you have your internet level proficiency so you, you know, you,

1353
01:44:32,840 --> 01:44:36,700
when you log into the internet you have this number that you can go on the web with

1354
01:44:36,700 --> 01:44:46,540
and be allowed to type or, you know, have your degree of, you know, like with driving too.

1355
01:44:46,540 --> 01:44:50,580
You need to keep testing, but when you reach a certain age,

1356
01:44:50,580 --> 01:44:53,700
you need to take the, I'm still OK to drive test.

1357
01:44:53,700 --> 01:44:56,260
Or then there needs to be a certain age.

1358
01:44:56,260 --> 01:44:59,820
And in some cases, especially with driving, when you get to

1359
01:44:59,820 --> 01:45:01,460
a certain age, you need to take it every year.

1360
01:45:01,460 --> 01:45:02,860
Yes.

1361
01:45:02,860 --> 01:45:05,540
When you get to 65, you have to, in fact, when you're like

1362
01:45:05,540 --> 01:45:07,620
85, you need a monthly exam.

1363
01:45:07,620 --> 01:45:10,140
And they need to make sure that you can see over the

1364
01:45:10,140 --> 01:45:12,580
fucking dashboard.

1365
01:45:12,580 --> 01:45:12,880
Thank you.

1366
01:45:12,880 --> 01:45:17,800
You're also, you also need to, what?

1367
01:45:18,160 --> 01:45:21,620
Especially if you're a little Asian woman in the Bay Area with SUV.

1368
01:45:22,640 --> 01:45:29,280
I also think that you need to be able to pass a test before you can breed.

1369
01:45:30,260 --> 01:45:34,660
You know? I think that that would solve a lot of problems in the world with overpopulation

1370
01:45:35,160 --> 01:45:41,020
and with, you know, with, you need to like take the parental responsibility test.

1371
01:45:41,020 --> 01:45:45,060
You think it wouldn't be that you wouldn't need that much intelligence to be a parent

1372
01:45:45,060 --> 01:45:48,860
I mean, I got this put it in the right hole. I mean, it's pretty much it

1373
01:45:48,860 --> 01:45:56,460
That's that's that in and of itself is just breeding people can fucking fucking fucking fuck all they want to and you know

1374
01:45:56,460 --> 01:45:59,940
Sprout babies like bunnies. I think it's all stuff that they're taking while they're breeding

1375
01:46:00,540 --> 01:46:06,740
But I think that you know, there's there's not many responsible parents around these days, you know, don't you agree?

1376
01:46:07,380 --> 01:46:08,500
and

1377
01:46:08,500 --> 01:46:12,420
You know, I'm talking to the people that I know personally I'd say

1378
01:46:13,180 --> 01:46:17,660
They're fairly responsible with me. I know I'm not responsible enough right now to be a parent

1379
01:46:17,660 --> 01:46:23,140
So I'm not gonna go out and do something. I'm not even responsible enough to own a pet. I have a Shermy

1380
01:46:24,060 --> 01:46:28,100
But Shermy poops in a box and I only have to clean up after her once a day

1381
01:46:29,980 --> 01:46:32,820
Okay, I don't have to change diaper 20 million times a day

1382
01:46:34,980 --> 01:46:36,980
Right, yeah, okay, I

1383
01:46:36,980 --> 01:46:50,160
When I was out and about earlier in the week, I was just noticing little children running

1384
01:46:50,160 --> 01:46:54,420
off to do whatever, and their parents were sitting there on their cell phones having

1385
01:46:54,420 --> 01:47:00,720
conversations while little children are off running around and doing stupid little children

1386
01:47:00,720 --> 01:47:01,720
things.

1387
01:47:01,720 --> 01:47:05,120
It's my big reason for not wanting to go back to golf anymore, not necessarily because the

1388
01:47:05,120 --> 01:47:07,240
machines aren't working.

1389
01:47:07,240 --> 01:47:09,960
It's just the fact that people just say, oh, well, the staff

1390
01:47:09,960 --> 01:47:11,520
will babysit my children.

1391
01:47:11,520 --> 01:47:13,800
Oh my god, I hate that.

1392
01:47:13,800 --> 01:47:16,120
No, you do not talk on the cell phone when your children

1393
01:47:16,120 --> 01:47:16,880
need your attention.

1394
01:47:16,880 --> 01:47:20,040
You can do that when you're driving, OK?

1395
01:47:20,040 --> 01:47:21,440
No.

1396
01:47:21,440 --> 01:47:24,520
That's why, and I was thinking of this when I was listening

1397
01:47:24,520 --> 01:47:32,920
to, I was very, very, I guess, proud when I was listening to

1398
01:47:32,920 --> 01:47:39,800
Vandalas talk about how much time and care he takes with his family. I just wish there

1399
01:47:39,800 --> 01:47:43,640
were more people like that. They should limit families to have only one

1400
01:47:43,640 --> 01:47:49,640
child just like they do in China. But then you're being a fascist. You can't

1401
01:47:49,640 --> 01:47:53,840
literally step in there. This is America, land of the free. It's as great of an idea

1402
01:47:53,840 --> 01:47:58,720
as it sounds. There should be certain people that are limited to one child or zero child.

1403
01:47:58,720 --> 01:47:59,720
It's not possible.

1404
01:47:59,720 --> 01:48:05,400
Child services don't step in for neglect until the child's already dead, left in their car

1405
01:48:05,400 --> 01:48:10,880
for five hours, burned to death, or asphyxiated, or whatever.

1406
01:48:10,880 --> 01:48:15,760
I just really think that it's very sad, and I needed to take a moment to get that out

1407
01:48:15,760 --> 01:48:21,920
of my system, because this is what was on the news just last week, or like with Disneyland,

1408
01:48:21,920 --> 01:48:22,920
with the gum on the rail.

1409
01:48:22,920 --> 01:48:23,920
Stupid child.

1410
01:48:23,920 --> 01:48:24,920
Parent wasn't watching.

1411
01:48:24,920 --> 01:48:30,380
parent wasn't watching, you know. There's probably a little kid looking for a quarter

1412
01:48:30,380 --> 01:48:37,220
on the track and that's how the train derailed. It's, you know, people just take responsibility.

1413
01:48:37,220 --> 01:48:43,180
Now, since I brought up Disneyland again, all the cool rides have gone away because

1414
01:48:43,180 --> 01:48:47,820
of stupid people. I mean, look at, like, the people mover. The people mover, while slow,

1415
01:48:47,820 --> 01:48:51,820
was a good way... They did not get rid of the people mover. Yes, they did. Oh, my God.

1416
01:48:51,820 --> 01:48:52,820
They got rid of the people mover!

1417
01:48:52,820 --> 01:48:53,820
They got rid of the people mover!

1418
01:48:53,820 --> 01:48:57,220
Disneyland did not get rid of the people mover, did they?

1419
01:48:57,220 --> 01:48:59,180
Yeah, like, you can go to hell!

1420
01:48:59,180 --> 01:49:00,580
I hope all their rides derail.

1421
01:49:00,580 --> 01:49:04,020
The people mover was the coolest thing on the entire planet, and if they got rid of

1422
01:49:04,020 --> 01:49:05,020
it, ugh!

1423
01:49:05,020 --> 01:49:06,020
Ooh!

1424
01:49:06,020 --> 01:49:07,020
You know why they got rid of it?

1425
01:49:07,020 --> 01:49:10,300
Cuz some dumb fuck thought it'd be a cool idea to rock the thing and it fell over.

1426
01:49:10,300 --> 01:49:11,700
Well, then kill him!

1427
01:49:11,700 --> 01:49:12,700
Just kill him!

1428
01:49:12,700 --> 01:49:14,340
Put, give me a gun, I'll shoot the fucker myself!

1429
01:49:14,340 --> 01:49:16,060
Well, actually, he did die.

1430
01:49:16,060 --> 01:49:18,340
Don't tell me they got rid of Mr. Toad's Wild Rider.

1431
01:49:18,340 --> 01:49:19,340
No, they didn't get rid of that.

1432
01:49:19,340 --> 01:49:20,340
I'm driving to Anaheim right now.

1433
01:49:20,340 --> 01:49:27,860
I don't know how they got rid of Autopia too, didn't they?

1434
01:49:27,860 --> 01:49:30,940
No, it's not gone, but it's not working.

1435
01:49:30,940 --> 01:49:35,860
Are they going to get rid of the teacups because someone got sick?

1436
01:49:35,860 --> 01:49:40,220
Look, you stupid bitch, you can see how the ride works, you're going to spin around and

1437
01:49:40,220 --> 01:49:43,460
around and around and around about a thousand goddamn times.

1438
01:49:43,460 --> 01:49:47,060
If you don't think you can't handle it without puking, then fuck off.

1439
01:49:47,060 --> 01:49:50,980
What else did they get rid of? They replaced the people where there's these things called

1440
01:49:50,980 --> 01:50:00,860
rocket rods. They're basically these things that go really fast. They just have the acceleration

1441
01:50:00,860 --> 01:50:06,900
rate on them. It's just ungodly huge. But that's the problem. I don't know. Someone

1442
01:50:06,900 --> 01:50:12,540
did something in that one, stood up or something, and they died too on that. So that's why those

1443
01:50:12,540 --> 01:50:13,540
guys...

1444
01:50:13,540 --> 01:50:19,060
them it's a small world they will never ever have to have it again oh god I wish

1445
01:50:19,060 --> 01:50:24,060
it's a small world is so lame the other thing is that it takes someone dying and

1446
01:50:24,060 --> 01:50:27,580
then they get rid of things that other people haven't they better not get rid of

1447
01:50:27,580 --> 01:50:30,940
Thunder Mountain Railroad that ride rocked okay no they're probably gonna

1448
01:50:30,940 --> 01:50:38,420
turn it into you know like I don't know Daffy Ducks you know piano adventure I

1449
01:50:38,420 --> 01:50:38,920
I don't know.

1450
01:50:38,920 --> 01:50:40,340
I'm thinking about your rabbit.

1451
01:50:40,340 --> 01:50:42,860
Piano Adventures is a piano on a track.

1452
01:50:42,860 --> 01:50:43,840
It's a runaway piano.

1453
01:50:45,840 --> 01:50:48,300
People do not know what the People Mover is in our chat

1454
01:50:48,300 --> 01:50:48,540
room.

1455
01:50:48,540 --> 01:50:50,860
That's fine, because we have people from all parts

1456
01:50:50,860 --> 01:50:52,140
of the world that listen to Orin's Entrada.

1457
01:50:52,140 --> 01:50:54,020
The People Mover is a ride at Disneyland.

1458
01:50:54,020 --> 01:50:56,020
It's in Tomorrow World, because Disneyland is broken up

1459
01:50:56,020 --> 01:50:57,100
in all these little areas.

1460
01:50:57,100 --> 01:51:01,500
You have the New Orleans section and the jungle section,

1461
01:51:01,500 --> 01:51:04,100
and you have Tomorrowland, which is all the futuristic stuff.

1462
01:51:04,100 --> 01:51:05,940
That's where the Star Wars ride is.

1463
01:51:05,940 --> 01:51:06,420
We all know.

1464
01:51:06,420 --> 01:51:07,060
Yeah.

1465
01:51:07,060 --> 01:51:09,420
50 years ago, anyway, was the Tomorrow stuff.

1466
01:51:09,420 --> 01:51:11,820
But that's where Captain Neo was.

1467
01:51:11,820 --> 01:51:15,100
That's where Space Mountain is.

1468
01:51:15,100 --> 01:51:17,900
Anyway, so People Mover was this little ride.

1469
01:51:17,900 --> 01:51:19,220
And you sat on it.

1470
01:51:19,220 --> 01:51:21,580
And it was like a little trolley.

1471
01:51:21,580 --> 01:51:23,200
And you went all around Tomorrow World.

1472
01:51:23,200 --> 01:51:25,100
And it gave you a little lecture about all the little

1473
01:51:25,100 --> 01:51:26,380
things that were going on.

1474
01:51:26,380 --> 01:51:30,380
But at the end of it, it would say something about you got

1475
01:51:30,380 --> 01:51:32,340
put in the middle of Tron or something.

1476
01:51:32,340 --> 01:51:35,300
And all the walls would start flashing all these pictures.

1477
01:51:35,300 --> 01:51:38,380
and it felt like you're going like a thousand miles an hour because the pictures are flying

1478
01:51:38,380 --> 01:51:42,360
by so fast and it was not it was narrated by Tim Curry

1479
01:51:42,360 --> 01:51:48,560
and if they got rid of the people mover Disneyland could go fuck itself

1480
01:51:48,560 --> 01:51:51,960
there was too big of a line for me to go on the people mover the one time I've been

1481
01:51:51,960 --> 01:51:54,660
see that was the funny thing is it wasn't

1482
01:51:54,660 --> 01:51:55,480
every time

1483
01:51:55,480 --> 01:51:57,620
no one used to go on the people mover because it was like

1484
01:51:57,620 --> 01:51:58,340
ooh

1485
01:51:58,340 --> 01:52:01,540
people mover is space mountain we'll go on space mountain

1486
01:52:01,540 --> 01:52:05,780
People over are just like, I'm tired of walking, I just want to sit down for a little bit.

1487
01:52:05,780 --> 01:52:09,260
You know they've already been doing Space Mountain now.

1488
01:52:09,260 --> 01:52:10,800
Space Mountain is closed for

1489
01:52:10,800 --> 01:52:12,340
renovations.

1490
01:52:12,340 --> 01:52:16,400
Yeah, because it sucks, it's old. I've only been on it once, so it was fun for me, but...

1491
01:52:16,400 --> 01:52:19,420
You need like techno music in there.

1492
01:52:19,420 --> 01:52:20,480
That rock.

1493
01:52:20,480 --> 01:52:21,980
Well anyway, um...

1494
01:52:21,980 --> 01:52:24,700
Back to, what was I ranting about? Stupid people?

1495
01:52:24,700 --> 01:52:26,820
Kids, yeah, kids.

1496
01:52:26,820 --> 01:52:27,980
They need a ride

1497
01:52:27,980 --> 01:52:30,140
that's just like F-Zero.

1498
01:52:30,140 --> 01:52:35,140
I think that kids will grow up better if they had the same exposure to stuff that we had.

1499
01:52:35,140 --> 01:52:37,660
They need tetherball.

1500
01:52:37,660 --> 01:52:42,940
Children need tetherball so that if you get hit in the head enough times, duck, dodge

1501
01:52:42,940 --> 01:52:43,940
the ball.

1502
01:52:43,940 --> 01:52:48,860
Parents have to understand that there's a certain percentage of kids that will get raped

1503
01:52:48,860 --> 01:52:50,660
and molested by people.

1504
01:52:50,660 --> 01:52:54,400
Just accept the fact and hope that your kids aren't part of the statistic.

1505
01:52:54,400 --> 01:52:56,780
You can't protect them from everything.

1506
01:52:56,780 --> 01:52:59,140
You have to prepare them as best as you can.

1507
01:52:59,140 --> 01:53:14,440
responsibility. They take away everything. All the stuff that we had when we were kids,

1508
01:53:14,440 --> 01:53:22,020
that stuff was cool. I fell off of the freaking monkey bars before busted my lip open. I have

1509
01:53:22,020 --> 01:53:30,500
have a scar right here, see? And I'm perfectly well adjusted. Oh, I cried. Ow. I was stupid

1510
01:53:30,500 --> 01:53:35,900
and I never fell off of the monkey bars again. What's up with these pansy, like, playground

1511
01:53:35,900 --> 01:53:40,260
equipment that they have now? It's all like powder. Plastic. Plastic. Whatever happened

1512
01:53:40,260 --> 01:53:42,500
to the really cool wood stuff? They're going to get rid of the sand boxes next because

1513
01:53:42,500 --> 01:53:49,700
children are going to eat sand. I ate my pies. Look at me. I'm normal. Hot. Well, relatively.

1514
01:53:49,700 --> 01:53:55,620
I grew up mostly adjusted, you know, forget this.

1515
01:53:55,620 --> 01:54:03,260
When I was back in Alabama, I went by my elementary school and I swear, all the metal things that

1516
01:54:03,260 --> 01:54:08,180
I used to climb on, only a couple of them were there and they were rusted over so that

1517
01:54:08,180 --> 01:54:11,060
nobody would want to touch them because they look nasty.

1518
01:54:11,060 --> 01:54:15,820
It's not fun anymore, not fun to be a kid these days, especially with the Teletubbies

1519
01:54:15,820 --> 01:54:20,020
teaching you that it's okay to go up to a perfect stranger and give them a hug.

1520
01:54:20,020 --> 01:54:26,860
Yeah, yeah, yeah! I'm going to hug you! You're so retarded! You missed the whole thing we

1521
01:54:26,860 --> 01:54:33,060
just did, so we're going to do it again! You know, the world is not like sunshine. You

1522
01:54:33,060 --> 01:54:38,500
know, when I was little, you know, okay, you know what I was raised with when I was five?

1523
01:54:38,500 --> 01:54:43,740
I freakin' had, well, what did I watch when I was little? I watched the Smurfs, and the

1524
01:54:43,740 --> 01:54:47,420
The Smurfs taught you that there's fire, and it burns down the trees, and the world's not

1525
01:54:47,420 --> 01:54:48,780
a happy singing place.

1526
01:54:48,780 --> 01:54:50,260
And the Smurfs promote homosexuality.

1527
01:54:50,260 --> 01:54:52,260
Yes, they do.

1528
01:54:52,260 --> 01:54:55,500
Except when they got Smurfed, but I think that, you know...

1529
01:54:55,500 --> 01:54:56,500
Smurfed.

1530
01:54:56,500 --> 01:54:58,760
It was like a colony of ants.

1531
01:54:58,760 --> 01:55:00,940
They all fucked the queen.

1532
01:55:00,940 --> 01:55:02,500
And then, when I was...

1533
01:55:02,500 --> 01:55:07,600
How old was I, 1983, 84?

1534
01:55:07,600 --> 01:55:10,220
I was about seven.

1535
01:55:10,220 --> 01:55:16,220
The best show ever came on TV, Transformers, at Transformers at G.I.

1536
01:55:16,220 --> 01:55:17,220
Joe.

1537
01:55:17,220 --> 01:55:21,300
You mean there's a different Transformers than the one with these little Transformers

1538
01:55:21,300 --> 01:55:23,420
that they have to protect and it's like Pokemon?

1539
01:55:23,420 --> 01:55:24,420
Okay, forget it.

1540
01:55:24,420 --> 01:55:26,540
You know, I don't want that Armada crap.

1541
01:55:26,540 --> 01:55:29,660
What about the ones where they turned into dinosaurs?

1542
01:55:29,660 --> 01:55:30,660
I love that one.

1543
01:55:30,660 --> 01:55:31,660
And apes and stuff.

1544
01:55:31,660 --> 01:55:33,140
Hey, don't forget about Xenobots.

1545
01:55:33,140 --> 01:55:34,540
Yeah, whatever.

1546
01:55:34,540 --> 01:55:35,540
Okay.

1547
01:55:35,540 --> 01:55:40,180
Okay, um, but you know, I had what Jason the real warriors we had Voltron

1548
01:55:40,820 --> 01:55:44,320
We had what now what it what it what is there to watch on TV now?

1549
01:55:45,780 --> 01:55:47,780
Pokemon Digimon

1550
01:55:49,780 --> 01:55:51,780
Retarded okay

1551
01:55:52,020 --> 01:55:58,200
Yu-gi-oh and did you want people die? Okay. Why are we teaching kids to play cards? It's not like

1552
01:55:58,200 --> 01:55:59,200
What kind of thing?

1553
01:55:59,200 --> 01:56:00,200
That's the way it is.

1554
01:56:00,200 --> 01:56:01,200
That's the way it is.

1555
01:56:01,200 --> 01:56:05,980
They're going to get a paper cut and get infected and die.

1556
01:56:05,980 --> 01:56:06,980
Of course.

1557
01:56:06,980 --> 01:56:07,980
And then cards will be banned.

1558
01:56:07,980 --> 01:56:09,760
It was the same thing when we were kids.

1559
01:56:09,760 --> 01:56:12,980
Every cartoon had its elaborate marking scheme that went with it.

1560
01:56:12,980 --> 01:56:15,480
Everybody wanted the He-Man that you would punch it and the little thing would spin around

1561
01:56:15,480 --> 01:56:16,480
and make it look like it was damaged.

1562
01:56:16,480 --> 01:56:18,480
They don't have battle damaged toys anymore, do they?

1563
01:56:18,480 --> 01:56:19,480
I know.

1564
01:56:19,480 --> 01:56:20,480
That's so stupid.

1565
01:56:20,480 --> 01:56:23,320
We had really cool things when we were young.

1566
01:56:23,320 --> 01:56:24,320
I'll tell you what.

1567
01:56:24,320 --> 01:56:25,320
I cry for today's children.

1568
01:56:25,320 --> 01:56:28,000
You know what toy I play with more than anything, though?

1569
01:56:28,000 --> 01:56:31,000
More than anything what toy I played with, Legos.

1570
01:56:31,000 --> 01:56:34,160
I had Lincoln Logs and they were made out of wood and I got splinters in my fingers

1571
01:56:34,160 --> 01:56:35,160
when I tried to break them.

1572
01:56:35,160 --> 01:56:37,280
You tried to break the Lincoln Logs?

1573
01:56:37,280 --> 01:56:39,160
I did because my house didn't look right.

1574
01:56:39,160 --> 01:56:42,200
I'm surprised you didn't try to set them on fire or burn your house down.

1575
01:56:42,200 --> 01:56:44,200
I did actually.

1576
01:56:44,200 --> 01:56:49,400
And I had pick up sticks that were made out of metal.

1577
01:56:49,400 --> 01:56:52,160
I built catapults of my Lincoln Logs.

1578
01:56:52,160 --> 01:56:57,020
You put one of those small ones on a nice roof piece and you can hit it just really

1579
01:56:57,020 --> 01:57:03,260
I would build parts of my houses with rubber bands so that I could make them collapsible

1580
01:57:03,260 --> 01:57:07,500
so that they would kill my weeble men that I put inside of them.

1581
01:57:07,500 --> 01:57:08,500
Comment from the chat room.

1582
01:57:08,500 --> 01:57:12,060
This is how you know it's all coming to an end.

1583
01:57:12,060 --> 01:57:13,060
Guess what?

1584
01:57:13,060 --> 01:57:16,340
Riceprincess says she saw Transformers on MTV.

1585
01:57:16,340 --> 01:57:17,860
Can I cry?

1586
01:57:17,860 --> 01:57:18,860
You may have a sniff now.

1587
01:57:18,860 --> 01:57:23,820
Unless it was the old ones, but if it was the new crappy ones then I'm going to cry.

1588
01:57:23,820 --> 01:57:24,820
Yes.

1589
01:57:24,820 --> 01:57:25,820
Now get 2DX's winner.

1590
01:57:25,820 --> 01:57:26,820
Tinker Toys.

1591
01:57:26,820 --> 01:57:38,740
I had the tinker toys that were life-size. They were the size of me. They kicked ass.

1592
01:57:38,740 --> 01:57:45,540
You could build giant things that hurt people. They had building pieces like PVC pipes, so

1593
01:57:45,540 --> 01:57:51,280
you could fight with the pieces and you could injure people. It was awesome. I had tons

1594
01:57:51,280 --> 01:57:56,880
of those things oh my god just tons we had we had these things that were like

1595
01:57:56,880 --> 01:58:01,880
plastic hard plastic sticks with foam on them and you could beat each other up

1596
01:58:01,880 --> 01:58:04,920
with foam but if you took the foam off they were sticks and you could whack

1597
01:58:04,920 --> 01:58:10,680
people in the head with them and like toys were lethal when we were young

1598
01:58:10,680 --> 01:58:17,160
growing up with survival and look at us we're strong yeah because we're not dead

1599
01:58:17,160 --> 01:58:20,520
from our toys I think pixie dust is saying in the chat room that the Smurfs

1600
01:58:20,520 --> 01:58:24,520
Here's a reminder of the Anna Nicole show.

1601
01:58:24,520 --> 01:58:28,520
Okay.

1602
01:58:28,520 --> 01:58:31,520
Anyway, how about the winner of the cage match?

1603
01:58:31,520 --> 01:58:32,520
Okay.

1604
01:58:32,520 --> 01:58:34,520
The winner of tonight's Orange Lounge Cage Match.

1605
01:58:34,520 --> 01:58:35,520
Are you closing?

1606
01:58:35,520 --> 01:58:36,520
Yes, I'm closing.

1607
01:58:36,520 --> 01:58:37,520
Eat your vegetables.

1608
01:58:37,520 --> 01:58:39,520
Eat your vegetables.

1609
01:58:39,520 --> 01:58:40,520
More spinach.

1610
01:58:40,520 --> 01:58:42,520
You need iron.

1611
01:58:42,520 --> 01:58:45,520
The winner of tonight's Orange Lounge Cage Match, I'm actually somewhat surprised by

1612
01:58:45,520 --> 01:58:53,440
this, but the chat room did vote this one as the winner tonight. It is last week's winner,

1613
01:58:53,440 --> 01:59:03,180
every little thing, face the change once again. Curse you, Loki, and your cursed trance music.

1614
01:59:03,180 --> 01:59:12,840
Alright, so I think now's a good break time, huh? What do you say when we come back we

1615
01:59:12,840 --> 01:59:17,520
let the Rio Rant team begin, eh? Sure. The FUs of the week when we come back. Also,

1616
01:59:17,520 --> 01:59:21,080
before we get into the FUs of the week though, I want to talk about my gaming experience

1617
01:59:21,080 --> 01:59:24,080
this week, because I've actually been playing more video games this week, so I'm going to

1618
01:59:24,080 --> 01:59:25,080
Gasp!

1619
01:59:25,080 --> 01:59:26,080
Gasp.

1620
01:59:26,080 --> 01:59:28,080
So, we'll be back.

1621
01:59:56,080 --> 02:00:12,360
Oh, one more time, I'm back with a new rhyme Hey, here we go again, turn it up my friend

1622
02:00:12,360 --> 02:00:19,200
No, we don't stop, we rock the spot No, we don't quit, get ready or this is it

1623
02:00:19,200 --> 02:00:20,200
Do you like the dream?

1624
02:00:20,200 --> 02:00:21,200
Hey, I like the dream, baby Do you like the dream?

1625

Baby, do you like to dream? Oh, I like to dream

02:00:25,600 --> 02:00:28,800
Mama, do you like to scream? Hey, I like to scream

02:00:28,900 --> 02:00:32,120
Baby, do you like to scream? Oh, scream it out

02:00:32,640 --> 02:00:35,760
Scream a dream, Mother Tension Scream

1630
02:00:35,900 --> 02:00:38,800
Take it every scene before you make me scream

1631
02:00:39,440 --> 02:00:42,440
Scream a dream, nothing but nothing just a dream

1632
02:00:42,540 --> 02:00:45,940
If you won't accept a dream or you're making me believe

1633
02:00:46,220 --> 02:00:48,720
Ooh la-da-da, la-da-da

1634
02:00:48,720 --> 02:00:52,720
You gotta dream a little dream

1635
02:01:18,720 --> 02:01:21,720
Oh yeah

1636
02:01:21,720 --> 02:01:28,720
You get it off the floor

1637
02:01:28,720 --> 02:01:31,720
I need to love it

1638
02:01:31,720 --> 02:01:38,720
You get it off the floor

1639
02:01:38,720 --> 02:01:41,720
I need to love it

1640
02:01:41,720 --> 02:01:47,720
You get it off the floor

1641
02:01:47,720 --> 02:02:08,720
Get off the floor, I think I love it

02:02:17,720 --> 02:02:19,720

I'm gonna get away from you with another dimension

1647
02:02:45,100 --> 02:02:52,240
I'm gonna get away from you with another dimension

1648
02:02:52,240 --> 02:02:56,240
I'm gonna take you to another dimension, babe

1649
02:03:52,240 --> 02:04:20,880
Hi, this is Melby of RTF, and for an extra $1.99 a minute, my girlfriend Melby can join

1651
02:04:25,560 --> 02:04:29,960
to the one place that costs absolutely nothing to go to and still the fun is just as great.

1652
02:04:29,960 --> 02:04:34,760
It's Orange Lounge Radio, Sunday nights. Kick it with me and you just might realize the

1653
02:04:34,760 --> 02:04:47,280
best things in life are free. Hello, we're back. Uh, guess who's back? Hi. Yes, Shark's

1654
02:04:47,280 --> 02:04:52,060
goes back hello so you're you're back finally we were starting to worry a

1655
02:04:52,060 --> 02:04:55,420
little bit we're like well she's been gone a while least I was I was freaking

1656
02:04:55,420 --> 02:05:00,700
lights just take forever although the funniest lowriding truck ever dude it

1657
02:05:00,700 --> 02:05:05,420
looks like his ass was dragging on the ground and it had spinners oh god those

1658
02:05:05,420 --> 02:05:09,900
are the most annoying things on the planet those things that spin I almost

1659
02:05:09,900 --> 02:05:13,340
I took my ditch cam and took a picture of it, it was that bad, but he turned before

1660
02:05:13,340 --> 02:05:17,420
I could do it.

1661
02:05:17,420 --> 02:05:20,580
Spinners are horrible, and it's even worse on a lowriding truck that's dragging its ass

1662
02:05:20,580 --> 02:05:21,580
on the ground.

1663
02:05:21,580 --> 02:05:26,140
What did we see earlier?

1664
02:05:26,140 --> 02:05:27,140
I don't remember.

1665
02:05:27,140 --> 02:05:28,140
Tell them what we saw.

1666
02:05:28,140 --> 02:05:30,980
We saw the Ultimate of Crap Lowriders, it was so ghetto.

1667
02:05:30,980 --> 02:05:38,740
It was bad paint job, red and white, and it was just some crappy Chevy.

1668
02:05:38,740 --> 02:05:43,340
The fearless sticker was the one in my house that was really crappy too.

1669
02:05:43,340 --> 02:05:46,500
If your car looks like crap, make it look good before you put a sticker on it that has

1670
02:05:46,500 --> 02:05:51,620
fearless on it.

1671
02:05:51,620 --> 02:05:54,540
People just fear my car when I'm in it.

1672
02:05:54,540 --> 02:06:00,940
My little Tercel can do some damage.

1673
02:06:00,940 --> 02:06:03,820
I took a picture of my dream car though, one of my dream cars.

1674
02:06:03,820 --> 02:06:07,940
There was a 350Z in the parking lot in the Dara, so I took a picture of it because I

1675
02:06:07,940 --> 02:06:14,340
I want one. Madeira. Madeira. I had a fun time at the fair. That's a suburb of Fresno.

1676
02:06:14,340 --> 02:06:20,100
I had a fun time at the fair though. You went to Fresno. I did not go to Fresno. I went

1677
02:06:20,100 --> 02:06:25,260
to some place. You went to a place that's worse than Fresno. The Madeira district fair.

1678
02:06:25,260 --> 02:06:31,580
I still have this vein of blue on my hand too. From where they stamped my hand. It looks

1679
02:06:31,580 --> 02:06:34,380
That's like a bruise.

1680
02:06:34,380 --> 02:06:39,380
Shall we get into the FUs of the week?

1681
02:06:39,380 --> 02:06:41,380
Showa!

1682
02:06:41,380 --> 02:06:52,380
This is the best part of the show.

1683
02:06:52,380 --> 02:06:54,380
This is fucked up.

1684
02:06:54,380 --> 02:06:56,380
Fuck being sick.

1685
02:06:56,380 --> 02:07:01,580
good timing my lungs

1686
02:07:01,580 --> 02:07:05,060
about being sick

1687
02:07:05,060 --> 02:07:08,340
about trying to enjoy myself while being sick

1688
02:07:08,340 --> 02:07:12,060
because I try and try and try but being sick sort of overshadows it

1689
02:07:12,060 --> 02:07:15,220
I had a very good time at the concert so that was great but

1690
02:07:15,220 --> 02:07:18,740
I just felt horrible

1691
02:07:18,740 --> 02:07:22,820
and I've been sick since Tuesday and it got bad enough for me to go to the doctor on Thursday

1692
02:07:22,820 --> 02:07:26,660
And I don't go to the doctor, so this is the first time I've actually been to a doctor

1693
02:07:26,660 --> 02:07:28,780
on my own in seven years.

1694
02:07:28,780 --> 02:07:38,540
Yes, I'm an angry girl, it's on my car, duh.

1695
02:07:38,540 --> 02:07:44,660
Fuck stupid people and parents who don't know how to take responsibility for their children.

1696
02:07:44,660 --> 02:07:51,780
And fuck things that suck and not having money.

1697
02:07:51,780 --> 02:07:56,780
having money is a big suck of all. I could stand being sick if I had money because then

1698
02:07:56,780 --> 02:08:03,780
I could go on the internet and shop. I can't even do that. I'm sick. So, yeah, that's not

1699
02:08:03,780 --> 02:08:05,780
it. I'm being sick.

1700
02:08:05,780 --> 02:08:09,780
Okay. Loki, I know you're cooking, but it's your turn.

1701
02:08:09,780 --> 02:08:14,780
He's making that bacon crap.

1702
02:08:14,780 --> 02:08:19,780
Oh, I don't believe that for a minute. Loki says he doesn't have anything. He's cooking.

1703
02:08:19,780 --> 02:08:23,780
You're going to give up your chance to rant about something? Fuck cooking.

1704
02:08:23,780 --> 02:08:24,780
Here.

1705
02:08:29,780 --> 02:08:31,780
Yeah, F you too.

1706
02:08:31,780 --> 02:08:33,780
Duh.

1707
02:08:33,780 --> 02:08:34,780
Stupid people.

1708
02:08:34,780 --> 02:08:38,780
You actually had a good week and nobody bothered you.

1709
02:08:38,780 --> 02:08:39,780
That's amazing.

1710
02:08:39,780 --> 02:08:40,780
Yeah, no.

1711
02:08:40,780 --> 02:08:43,780
I didn't have a good week and people bothered me.

1712
02:08:43,780 --> 02:08:45,780
But it's not really anything out of the usual.

1713
02:08:45,780 --> 02:08:48,780
I see.

1714
02:08:48,780 --> 02:08:51,280
Yes, because grief and fire don't hit.

1715
02:08:51,280 --> 02:08:52,780
You're the one that I want?

1716
02:08:52,780 --> 02:08:53,780
I wanna wanna...

1717
02:08:53,780 --> 02:08:54,780
Boop, boop, boop.

1718
02:08:54,780 --> 02:08:55,780
I'll be back.

1719
02:08:55,780 --> 02:08:57,780
I'm sure I'll interject something later.

1720
02:08:57,780 --> 02:08:59,280
Oh, hooray.

1721
02:08:59,280 --> 02:09:00,280
My turn!

1722
02:09:03,280 --> 02:09:05,280
My F.U. this week goes to Walmart.

1723
02:09:05,280 --> 02:09:07,280
Because Walmart is evil.

1724
02:09:07,280 --> 02:09:10,280
Walmart is the worst place on the face of the planet.

1725
02:09:10,280 --> 02:09:11,280
I'll tell you why.

1726
02:09:12,280 --> 02:09:12,780
Fine.

1727
02:09:12,780 --> 02:09:14,280
All you're gonna find is V8 Splash.

1728
02:09:16,280 --> 02:09:17,280
I love V8 Splash.

1729
02:09:17,280 --> 02:09:23,280
I've never had that before, but I'm really trying to not do that.

1730
02:09:23,280 --> 02:09:30,360
So V8, I have V8, Splash is mostly what I drink in iced tea and lemonade mixed.

1731
02:09:30,360 --> 02:09:31,360
I like that too.

1732
02:09:31,360 --> 02:09:35,600
V8 Splash is good, especially Diet V8 Splash because it's made with Splenda.

1733
02:09:35,600 --> 02:09:36,600
It tastes like Propel.

1734
02:09:36,600 --> 02:09:41,040
Anyway, my end of the week goes to Walmart because they suck.

1735
02:09:41,040 --> 02:09:45,420
I went to Walmart on Saturday night with Lanky Style because I wanted a new F-Zero game for

1736
02:09:45,420 --> 02:09:49,060
GameCube. And I was all excited because the new F-Zero game for GameCube was supposed

1737
02:09:49,060 --> 02:09:54,180
to kick ass. And I had a $10 off at Wal-Mart card because my work gives out gift cards

1738
02:09:54,180 --> 02:09:57,780
as incentives. So when we do something really good, we get a gift card. So I had a $10 gift

1739
02:09:57,780 --> 02:10:04,380
card to Wal-Mart because they asked people at work, what places would you like a gift

1740
02:10:04,380 --> 02:10:10,380
card to? And people were like, Wal-Mart. So anyway, I decided I'm going to go to Wal-Mart

1741
02:10:40,380 --> 02:10:43,660
stacking movies and she saw me and she came over and she said can I help you type thing

1742
02:10:43,660 --> 02:10:47,280
and I said yeah I wanted to get that game and she's like oh I don't have the key let

1743
02:10:47,280 --> 02:10:50,420
me get somebody who can get the key I'm like they don't have the key behind the counter

1744
02:10:50,420 --> 02:10:57,020
fine get the manager get the key so they get one of those people after ten minutes at least

1745
02:10:57,020 --> 02:11:05,140
ten minutes they get oops sorry my music ran out here after at least ten minutes finally

1746
02:11:05,140 --> 02:11:09,660
one of those folks in the red vests who I guess are like you know super Walmart stars

1747
02:11:09,660 --> 02:11:12,260
or whatever they are, managers, decision managers, whatever they are. They're the Red Vest people.

1748
02:11:12,260 --> 02:11:16,320
At Walmart you have the Blue Vest people who are the normal drones and the Red Vest people

1749
02:11:16,320 --> 02:11:23,320
who command the blue drones, right? So a Red Vest came by and he had the wrong key. He

1750
02:11:23,440 --> 02:11:27,220
tried to open it up and he had the wrong key. And the woman who was there was like, no,

1751
02:11:27,220 --> 02:11:31,300
no, no, you need the blue and green one, not the blue one. Apparently everything's color

1752
02:11:31,300 --> 02:11:38,300
coded at Walmart. So he leaves and ten minutes later, after waiting another ten minutes,

1753
02:11:38,300 --> 02:11:45,300
he comes back and says, I can't find it. So finally the lady says, I'm so sorry. I will

1754
02:11:45,300 --> 02:11:49,420
go to, I know where the key is. I'll go get it. So she goes off. Ten minutes later, she

1755
02:11:49,420 --> 02:11:55,420
comes back. Sir, I'm so sorry. After a half hour now of waiting. Sir, I'm so sorry. The

1756
02:11:55,420 --> 02:11:59,900
key isn't where it's supposed to be. What the fuck do you mean the key is not where

1757
02:11:59,900 --> 02:12:03,420
it's supposed to be? Who opened the case? No one opened the case between the time I

1758
02:12:03,420 --> 02:12:07,780
was there and when she was there. Where was the manager? Where was anybody running the

1759
02:12:07,780 --> 02:12:11,160
electronics department. Why aren't things that are supposed to be? Why isn't the key

1760
02:12:11,160 --> 02:12:15,000
behind the counter? Why doesn't the red vest guy carry the key? Why doesn't he know what

1761
02:12:15,000 --> 02:12:20,000
the hell color key goes with what? Doesn't he know how to run his own fucking store?

1762
02:12:20,000 --> 02:12:27,000
Fuck. I was about to say, go to the hardware department and get me a hammer. I'll fix this.

1763
02:12:27,200 --> 02:12:34,200
Seriously. So. God. So I didn't get my game. I'm pissed. I leave Walmart and I don't get

1764
02:12:34,200 --> 02:12:37,160
I leave Walmart, and I don't get anything.

1765
02:12:37,160 --> 02:12:39,360
So I went the next day to Target.

1766
02:12:39,360 --> 02:12:40,680
I purposely went to Target.

1767
02:12:40,680 --> 02:12:42,280
I could have gone to GameSpot, where I usually get games.

1768
02:12:42,280 --> 02:12:44,720
No, I went to Target, because I purposely went to buy it for

1769
02:12:44,720 --> 02:12:45,720
the competition.

1770
02:12:45,720 --> 02:12:48,280
So I went in, and within two minutes, there was a guy

1771
02:12:48,280 --> 02:12:49,200
behind the desk.

1772
02:12:49,200 --> 02:12:51,240
He opened the case up, got out my game, rang it up right

1773
02:12:51,240 --> 02:12:53,240
there, I was in and out of Target in three minutes.

1774
02:12:56,080 --> 02:12:59,160
Walmart can suck balls.

1775
02:12:59,160 --> 02:13:00,020
I'm done.

1776
02:13:00,020 --> 02:13:01,960
Your turn, Melody.

1777
02:13:01,960 --> 02:13:04,000
Wow, are you sure you want to do this?

1778
02:13:04,000 --> 02:13:05,000
Yes.

1779
02:13:05,000 --> 02:13:06,000
Fuck traffic.

1780
02:13:06,000 --> 02:13:07,000
Fuck red lights.

1781
02:13:07,000 --> 02:13:11,440
Fuck the cell phone reception in this damn area because it keeps dropping my phone.

1782
02:13:11,440 --> 02:13:15,600
And fuck the fucking truck that's parked in Jamie's parking lot because I freaking hit

1783
02:13:15,600 --> 02:13:19,360
it.

1784
02:13:19,360 --> 02:13:21,040
And Jamie says she's almost hit it a bunch of times.

1785
02:13:21,040 --> 02:13:25,360
And the funny thing is, you couldn't fucking tell that I hit the damn car.

1786
02:13:25,360 --> 02:13:29,120
It's like so beat up and crappy, you can't even tell.

1787
02:13:29,120 --> 02:13:31,740
Oh, Jamie wants to elaborate.

1788
02:13:31,740 --> 02:13:34,500
Park everybody who parks along that fence.

1789
02:13:34,500 --> 02:13:36,500
Cam Lao to hell.

1790
02:13:36,500 --> 02:13:41,020
Yeah, it's parking spots and then people parallel park right behind you so it's like a freaking

1791
02:13:41,020 --> 02:13:42,020
obstacle course.

1792
02:13:42,020 --> 02:13:46,140
And I had a car trying to come in that was trying to hurry me up but apparently I just

1793
02:13:46,140 --> 02:13:47,140
went a little too far.

1794
02:13:47,140 --> 02:13:49,340
And I couldn't see the truck because it was right directly behind me.

1795
02:13:49,340 --> 02:13:52,940
I was looking over my shoulder but you couldn't tell and I was like oh fuck.

1796
02:13:52,940 --> 02:14:00,300
So yeah fuck that and fuck having to drive home now because I was stupid and forgot something.

1797
02:14:00,300 --> 02:14:07,300
So fuck having to drive home and fucking me to work tomorrow because I really don't want

1798
02:14:07,300 --> 02:14:08,300
to.

1799
02:14:08,300 --> 02:14:14,620
Fuck money and fuck everything that's in your fucking and that's it.

1800
02:14:14,620 --> 02:14:17,460
I'm angry tonight.

1801
02:14:17,460 --> 02:14:19,460
Shall we hear from our chat room?

1802
02:14:19,460 --> 02:14:22,140
Alright, here they go.

1803
02:14:22,140 --> 02:14:23,140
Chat room FUs.

1804
02:14:23,140 --> 02:14:29,540
Dr. Tetsuya says, F you to missing most of the show and F you to morons at the theater.

1805
02:14:29,540 --> 02:14:34,700
If you're going to make cracks about the movie, that's what watching it at home is for.

1806
02:14:34,700 --> 02:14:36,580
And F you not having Soul Calibur 2.

1807
02:14:36,580 --> 02:14:39,580
Wait, I have to add something though there with the movie.

1808
02:14:39,580 --> 02:14:40,580
Yeah, Sharks Girl.

1809
02:14:40,580 --> 02:14:42,340
Sometimes that's better than the movie itself.

1810
02:14:42,340 --> 02:14:43,340
I definitely agree.

1811
02:14:43,340 --> 02:14:48,580
It really depends on the movie you're seeing because when we went and saw Pokemon, yelling

1812
02:14:48,580 --> 02:14:51,380
back at the screen made it ten times better.

1813
02:14:51,380 --> 02:14:53,300
Spice World, case point.

1814
02:14:53,300 --> 02:14:54,300
Thank you.

1815
02:14:54,300 --> 02:14:58,940
I saw Spice World opening day two.

1816
02:14:58,940 --> 02:15:00,940
High five!

1817
02:15:00,940 --> 02:15:02,940
I saw Spice World for free.

1818
02:15:02,940 --> 02:15:04,940
I didn't have to pay for it.

1819
02:15:04,940 --> 02:15:07,940
We were going to dress as Spice Girls and everything, but we didn't have time.

1820
02:15:07,940 --> 02:15:10,940
It was us and all these junior high girls.

1821
02:15:10,940 --> 02:15:12,940
Yeah, we were the only people in the theater.

1822
02:15:12,940 --> 02:15:14,940
My friend and I were the only people in the theater without a kid.

1823
02:15:14,940 --> 02:15:16,940
It was kind of scary, actually.

1824
02:15:16,940 --> 02:15:19,940
I had so much fun at Spice World.

1825
02:15:19,940 --> 02:15:21,940
Oh, I have the tape.

1826
02:15:21,940 --> 02:15:24,940
I have a promo poster. I have a promo poster I won.

1827
02:15:24,940 --> 02:15:25,940
Anyway.

1828
02:15:25,940 --> 02:15:27,940
Back to the inks, please.

1829
02:15:27,940 --> 02:15:29,940
But the supplies are all fine.

1830
02:15:29,940 --> 02:15:32,940
23rd Magus. He's pretty angsty.

1831
02:15:32,940 --> 02:15:37,940
F you to Angel's work schedule. This makes a whole month she's missed Orange Lounge. I cry.

1832
02:15:37,940 --> 02:15:42,940
A big fuck you to controlling parents who use the because it's my house argument.

1833
02:15:42,940 --> 02:15:44,940
This is their house?

1834
02:15:44,940 --> 02:15:47,940
Now I'm not allowed to leave my bedroom after 1 a.m.

1835
02:15:47,940 --> 02:15:49,940
Okay, you can live in the dorms.

1836
02:15:49,940 --> 02:15:50,940
What the fuck?

1837
02:15:50,940 --> 02:15:51,940
You can take out a student loan to live in the dorms.

1838
02:15:51,940 --> 02:15:56,940
F you to the CIS department dean at ARC for dropping me for my PC repair class.

1839
02:15:56,940 --> 02:16:01,940
Bitch die.

1840
02:16:01,940 --> 02:16:06,940
John Fields would like to say F you to Adobe Premiere freezing up a lot.

1841
02:16:06,940 --> 02:16:09,940
F you to one of my hard disks dying.

1842
02:16:09,940 --> 02:16:18,940
F you to classes that require outside class activity beyond homework.

1843
02:16:18,940 --> 02:16:25,940
EvilMaoki2Dx says, F you for me not being able to ogle the sweet lancer evolution 4

1844
02:16:26,020 --> 02:16:31,020
I saw in Japan Town today. And F you to my parents for changing plans for Benihana at

1845
02:16:31,020 --> 02:16:38,020
the last minute. F you to not being able to call uni when I want. Aww.

1846
02:16:38,860 --> 02:16:42,600
Nince would like to say F you to various things in my apartment like the crappy shower head

1847
02:16:42,600 --> 02:16:48,660
and the mailbox key that doesn't work. F you to class starting up again. F you to the physics

1848
02:16:48,660 --> 02:16:53,300
department at my college physics department for not letting me register yet. F you to

1849
02:16:53,300 --> 02:16:55,140
furniture in a box.

1850
02:16:55,140 --> 02:16:59,640
I can't have all these extra pieces.

1851
02:16:59,640 --> 02:17:04,340
Yes, IKEA is the exception. You may not have IKEA where you live, Ninst, but IKEA is the

1852
02:17:04,340 --> 02:17:06,540
exception. IKEA is godly.

1853
02:17:06,540 --> 02:17:11,660
IKEA is five minutes from where I work. I didn't even go.

1854
02:17:11,660 --> 02:17:15,840
I want to go. That's why I need to come visit, because I have to go to IKEA.

1855
02:17:15,840 --> 02:17:18,340
It's five minutes from where I work. I kid you not.

1856
02:17:18,340 --> 02:17:20,420
It's great. I have to go there myself.

1857
02:17:20,420 --> 02:17:23,740
But this is the new one, right? Not the one that's closer to me, actually.

1858
02:17:23,740 --> 02:17:27,340
If I wanted to go to the close IKEA, I'd just go to the one in the Berlin game.

1859
02:17:27,340 --> 02:17:31,780
Emeryville. No, the new one's in East Palo Alto. And I work in, like, Palo Alto.

1860
02:17:31,780 --> 02:17:34,660
I have a friend that's moving to Palo Alto this week.

1861
02:17:34,660 --> 02:17:37,700
Oh, wow. Cool. He's cute. You should be his friend.

1862
02:17:37,700 --> 02:17:39,100
Put him on Fredster.

1863
02:17:39,100 --> 02:17:43,700
Put him on Fredster.

1864
02:17:43,700 --> 02:17:45,020
Okay.

1865
02:17:45,020 --> 02:17:49,120
If you did the idiot who hit my neighbor's car, they hit the end trying to pull into

1866
02:17:49,120 --> 02:17:50,120
a spot.

1867
02:17:50,120 --> 02:17:52,640
Yeah, it was Sharks Girl.

1868
02:17:52,640 --> 02:17:55,040
And my neighbor and myself watched as this happened.

1869
02:17:55,040 --> 02:17:59,380
The guys just, well those guys, the guys just looked right at us, pulled out and tried to

1870
02:17:59,380 --> 02:18:05,340
hide further down in the parking lot.

1871
02:18:05,340 --> 02:18:09,380
John Fields would like to clarify, or give another F.U., F.U. to websites that force

1872
02:18:09,380 --> 02:18:11,780
you to say yes to their install programs.

1873
02:18:11,780 --> 02:18:15,260
I'm sick of hitting the power button on my computer because of them.

1874
02:18:15,260 --> 02:18:17,620
Mozilla is your friend.

1875
02:18:17,620 --> 02:18:18,620
Just click no.

1876
02:18:18,620 --> 02:18:22,460
Yeah, stop going to porns and wear sites because those are the only sites I know of that force

1877
02:18:22,460 --> 02:18:23,460
you to click yes.

1878
02:18:23,460 --> 02:18:24,460
No.

1879
02:18:24,460 --> 02:18:30,460
Well, all you have to do is just use the Google toolbar.

1880
02:18:30,460 --> 02:18:37,740
Lastly, Pixie Dust says, well, first off, a big F you to myself for getting a new tattoo.

1881
02:18:37,740 --> 02:18:40,020
It is scabby and hurts me.

1882
02:18:40,020 --> 02:18:46,260
So yeah, I'm not too comfy right now.

1883
02:18:46,260 --> 02:18:50,580
The ugly mofo I went out with for a month in April, f you for ruining my birthday pics

1884
02:18:50,580 --> 02:18:51,580
with your face.

1885
02:18:51,580 --> 02:18:52,580
You remember him, Skye?

1886
02:18:52,580 --> 02:18:53,580
Yes, I do.

1887
02:18:53,580 --> 02:18:56,380
And another f you goes to people who have been moody and bitchy around me.

1888
02:18:56,380 --> 02:19:02,340
Get off your poopy ass toilet and get happy.

1889
02:19:02,340 --> 02:19:04,100
That is the best thing ever.

1890
02:19:04,100 --> 02:19:06,740
Get off your poopy ass toilet.

1891
02:19:06,740 --> 02:19:08,740
Come on, get happy.

1892
02:19:08,740 --> 02:19:21,740
I nominate Dark Tetsuya to run that task because he always posts in the community.

1893
02:19:38,740 --> 02:19:41,740
Anyway, along with pixie dust fus by the way

1894
02:19:41,740 --> 02:19:46,840
I found the camera for my birthday dinner and that brings up all the bitchiness towards that asshole in the way

1895
02:19:46,840 --> 02:19:49,540
He dubbed me. He was you can do so much better than that, you know

1896
02:19:50,180 --> 02:19:52,920
F you to sky for not liking Walmart screw you too, bitch

1897
02:19:53,060 --> 02:19:58,260
It is ghetto, but hell I got a new razor with free refills for only five bucks. Lol

1898
02:19:58,260 --> 02:20:05,340
I'll get over the Walmart thing, but that made me mad. I'll get over it. I'll shop at Walmart again, but

1899
02:20:35,340 --> 02:20:43,340
LOKI wants to go now because they thought of something, and now he has bacon in his system, so can we get a mic over to LOKI?

1900
02:20:43,340 --> 02:20:45,340
Causing his angst level to rise.

1901
02:20:45,340 --> 02:20:49,340
That's it, they're done. That was the last one.

1902
02:20:49,340 --> 02:20:57,340
Have you the, um, stupid news reporters covering the Disneyland tragedy? Or, uh, comedy, I guess?

1903
02:20:57,340 --> 02:21:01,340
Um, you couldn't even get close enough to see mangled people, you suck.

1904
02:21:01,340 --> 02:21:07,340
I mean, if you're going to fly around in a helicopter, at least zoom down there, what are they going to do, shoot rockets at you? Come on.

1905
02:21:07,340 --> 02:21:10,340
I mean, nothing's stopping you.

1906
02:21:10,340 --> 02:21:15,340
F you to Gray Davis, because you suck.

1907
02:21:15,340 --> 02:21:22,340
And just because you think, you know, immigrants should now not drive, well, good for you.

1908
02:21:22,340 --> 02:21:29,340
Hello, hello, hello, news alert, that's an assembly bill, it's not just Gray Davis.

1909
02:21:29,340 --> 02:21:36,340
The only thing that bothers me about the recall is that I think they should recall the entire fucking assembly because Gray Davis gets blamed for all these bills.

1910
02:21:36,340 --> 02:21:41,340
Sure, he signs them when he can veto them, but he's not the sole bearer of all this stuff.

1911
02:21:41,340 --> 02:21:44,340
What do we do? He signs a bill. I sign a check. What's your point?

1912
02:21:44,340 --> 02:21:57,340
Anyways, after you're Gray Davis because you like illegal immigrants in the country because you do dirty work, I think we should kick you out of the country because you suck.

1913
02:22:27,340 --> 02:22:44,740
No. I'm done. All right. FUs of the week are done.com. Hooray. So I have something else

1914
02:22:44,740 --> 02:22:47,940
somewhere but my... Oh, Jamie has something to say?

1915
02:22:47,940 --> 02:22:53,940
I want pancakes right now. Oh, God. I wish it was like a IHOP near here.

1916
02:22:53,940 --> 02:22:55,020
I want...

1917
02:22:55,020 --> 02:22:56,560
Yeah, but it's closed.

1918
02:22:56,560 --> 02:22:57,880
Isn't it?

1919
02:22:57,880 --> 02:22:58,540
I think so.

1920
02:22:58,540 --> 02:23:00,020
I want pumpkin pancakes.

1921
02:23:00,020 --> 02:23:02,480
Besides, you had a happy yesterday. You don't want to get in today.

1922
02:23:02,480 --> 02:23:04,340
I want some pancakes. And we have Mongolian.

1923
02:23:04,340 --> 02:23:08,340
That means, you know, Mongolian means you go poop a lot.

1924
02:23:08,340 --> 02:23:10,900
You know what? I found a way to not

1925
02:23:10,900 --> 02:23:13,940
have a diarrhea bomb after Mongolian today.

1926
02:23:13,940 --> 02:23:14,860
What?

1927
02:23:14,860 --> 02:23:17,220
I didn't put any oil in it.

1928
02:23:17,220 --> 02:23:20,700
I only put about half the noodles I usually do. I put no oil in it. I put

1929
02:23:20,700 --> 02:23:23,360
nothing but teriyaki sauce and sweet and sour sauce.

1930
02:23:23,360 --> 02:23:25,360
I'm going to show you something.

1931
02:23:25,360 --> 02:23:27,360
Do you see this bottle?

1932
02:23:27,360 --> 02:23:29,360
I'm going to hold it up.

1933
02:23:29,360 --> 02:23:32,360
I've got to cover my name because we have our names.

1934
02:23:32,360 --> 02:23:34,360
Oh, we're going to put it on the webcam.

1935
02:23:34,360 --> 02:23:36,360
I am too.

1936
02:23:36,360 --> 02:23:38,360
Oh, good, my name's not on here.

1937
02:23:38,360 --> 02:23:39,360
All right.

1938
02:23:39,360 --> 02:23:42,360
OK.

1939
02:23:42,360 --> 02:23:45,360
I'll let you know how long you have to hold it there.

1940
02:23:45,360 --> 02:23:47,360
Oh, it took a ghost picture.

1941
02:23:47,360 --> 02:23:49,360
You've got 50 seconds before it goes again.

1942
02:23:49,360 --> 02:23:51,360
OK, so while we're waiting.

1943
02:23:51,360 --> 02:23:56,360
Look at that ghosty thing. That's erythromycin. It makes you poop.

1944
02:23:56,360 --> 02:23:59,360
Never eat Mongolian barbecue when you're on antibiotics.

1945
02:23:59,360 --> 02:24:01,360
Thank you.

1946
02:24:01,360 --> 02:24:06,360
Actually, the one thing that works better than this for going to the bathroom is sugar-free Hershey's dark chocolate.

1947
02:24:06,360 --> 02:24:10,360
But today's Mongolian? I just want to say today's Mongolian only made me fart a lot.

1948
02:24:10,360 --> 02:24:15,360
It did not make me go to the bathroom and just unload.

1949
02:24:15,360 --> 02:24:17,360
746 cleanser.

1950
02:24:17,360 --> 02:24:19,360
It's an all-purpose cleaner, and then they use it at roundtables.

1951
02:24:19,360 --> 02:24:22,360
You put it on pizza, it makes you shit out everything inside.

1952
02:24:22,360 --> 02:24:25,360
Loki, can you say that on the microphone, please?

1953
02:24:28,360 --> 02:24:32,360
Something that'll make you crap more is 746 all-purpose cleanser.

1954
02:24:32,360 --> 02:24:35,360
It's what they use to clean all the countertops and stuff at roundtable.

1955
02:24:35,360 --> 02:24:39,360
If they put that on your pizza and you eat it, it'll make you shit out.

1956
02:24:39,360 --> 02:24:44,480
shit out. I mean, someone did that to me once, and I never knew that that much crap could

1957
02:24:44,480 --> 02:24:59,120
be in my body. I think I shit for a complete hour, just non-stop shitting. It's like going

1958
02:24:59,120 --> 02:25:03,360
on a diet. It's like that stuff... No, I wonder if that's all that... You know that Hollywood

1959
02:25:03,360 --> 02:25:09,720
diet, the colon cleanser, the Hollywood diet that you can buy at Walgreens and you basically

1960
02:25:09,720 --> 02:25:12,920
mix it with water and you're supposed to take it on a weekend because you don't want to

1961
02:25:12,920 --> 02:25:16,320
take this at work because you're going to spend your weekend vacationing on the throne,

1962
02:25:16,320 --> 02:25:22,320
vacationing on the porcelain throne. Bring a Game Boy and a bathroom reader because it's

1963
02:25:22,320 --> 02:25:23,320
going to be a long weekend.

1964
02:25:23,320 --> 02:25:30,100
That's the only place that the British Excel is in toilet technology. They have some really

1965
02:25:30,100 --> 02:25:31,100
kick-ass toilets.

1966
02:25:31,100 --> 02:25:35,100
Dude, why isn't the bidet huge here? That's what I want to know.

1967
02:25:35,100 --> 02:25:38,100
Bidets are the shit. No pun intended.

1968
02:25:38,100 --> 02:25:40,100
I would love to have a bidet. That would kick ass.

1969
02:25:40,100 --> 02:25:42,100
I would... bidets...

1970
02:25:42,100 --> 02:25:44,100
Japanese super toilet. Oh yeah.

1971
02:25:44,100 --> 02:25:46,100
A Japanese super...

1972
02:25:46,100 --> 02:25:49,100
Man. I want a bidet.

1973
02:25:49,100 --> 02:25:52,100
Let's talk to our landlord and see if we can get a bidet in here.

1974
02:25:52,100 --> 02:26:03,980
I think now is a good time to take a break.

1975
02:26:03,980 --> 02:26:05,860
Can we just take a break?

1976
02:26:05,860 --> 02:26:06,860
We did the FUs of the week.

1977
02:26:06,860 --> 02:26:08,140
Oh yeah, it must have been caught.

1978
02:26:08,140 --> 02:26:10,500
It just feels like a break.

1979
02:26:10,500 --> 02:26:14,780
This break I'm going to play.59 again, but I'm going to play a special remix of it, because

1980
02:26:14,780 --> 02:26:16,800
a lot of people have been requesting this in chat rooms.

1981
02:26:16,800 --> 02:26:21,860
So this is a really good remix of.59 too, so to celebrate episode 59, which is what

1982
02:26:21,860 --> 02:26:24,940
So we're in right now, here's 0.59, the piano version,

1983
02:26:24,940 --> 02:26:26,580
a Naoki remix.

1984
02:26:26,580 --> 02:26:28,540
Enjoy.

1985
02:27:58,540 --> 02:28:03,540
...

1986
02:28:03,540 --> 02:28:08,540
...

1987
02:28:08,540 --> 02:28:13,540
...

1988
02:28:13,540 --> 02:28:18,540
...

1989
02:28:18,540 --> 02:28:23,540
...

1990
02:29:23,540 --> 02:29:51,580
And I hate it off another level And I hate it off another level

1991
02:29:51,580 --> 02:30:02,580
Why did our feelings die in action, when we fought for satisfaction?

1992
02:30:02,580 --> 02:30:07,580
But our hearts and S.O.S. saved me

1993
02:30:07,580 --> 02:30:12,580
Why did our love cause all this magic?

1994
02:30:12,580 --> 02:30:16,580
Just a new kind of tragedy

1995
02:30:16,580 --> 02:30:21,580
We were here for the best

1996
02:30:21,580 --> 02:30:24,580
In the heat of the night

1997
02:30:24,580 --> 02:30:28,580
Once you close to the fire

1998
02:30:28,580 --> 02:30:31,580
And the power of our hearts

1999
02:30:31,580 --> 02:30:35,580
Makes me drive inside

2000
02:30:35,580 --> 02:30:38,580
In the heat of the night

2001
02:30:38,580 --> 02:30:42,580
Once you close to the fire

2002
02:30:42,580 --> 02:30:45,580
And the power of our hearts

2003
02:30:45,580 --> 02:31:14,780
Let's listen in on an Orange Lounge radio staff meeting.

2004
02:31:14,780 --> 02:31:16,780
Do we want to be accepted by Hollywood?

2005
02:31:16,780 --> 02:31:18,780
No!

2006
02:31:18,780 --> 02:31:20,780
Do we care what people think of us?

2007
02:31:20,780 --> 02:31:22,780
No!

2008
02:31:22,780 --> 02:31:24,780
Do we want people to kiss our ass?

2009
02:31:24,780 --> 02:31:26,780
Yes!

2010
02:31:28,780 --> 02:31:34,780
Extreme Babati Radio. That's us. Orange Lounge Radio.

2011
02:31:36,780 --> 02:31:39,780
Sharks Girl is waving goodbye to all of you on the camera right now.

2012
02:31:39,780 --> 02:31:41,780
And then Loki is putting up some bacon.

2013
02:31:41,780 --> 02:31:45,460
Any final thoughts from you since you're leaving?

2014
02:31:45,460 --> 02:31:48,340
Ummm...

2015
02:31:48,340 --> 02:31:50,460
Tip your waiter.

2016
02:31:50,460 --> 02:31:53,380
Very nice. Have a safe drive.

2017
02:31:53,380 --> 02:31:58,180
Thank you for coming. Tell everyone in the bay we said hello.

2018
02:31:58,180 --> 02:32:01,860
I'm stealing another piece of bacon. That's another F-you to rob for stealing

2019
02:32:01,860 --> 02:32:04,100
Loki's bacon.

2020
02:32:04,100 --> 02:32:07,180
We were just talking during the break about how our bathroom has no door.

2021
02:32:07,180 --> 02:32:11,660
Oh my god, I walk into the bathroom. That's how we make our money. I'm like, where the hell is the door?

2022
02:32:11,660 --> 02:32:14,940
I don't see a door here. Do you not have a door on your bathroom?

2023
02:32:14,940 --> 02:32:18,780
Here in the Orange Lounge apartment, we have a sliding door. That's the trick.

2024
02:32:18,780 --> 02:32:23,500
It's really weird if you don't notice it, though, because you're just like, there's no door to the bathroom.

2025
02:32:23,500 --> 02:32:28,940
Jamie's playing with the webcam, so you might see some interesting things on the cam for the next little bit.

2026
02:32:28,940 --> 02:32:35,620
If you don't know our cam's address, go to our chat room, www.calibomani.com, click on Orange Lounge, and click on chat.

2027
02:32:35,620 --> 02:32:38,620
Okay. Yes, visit the forums while you're there.

2028
02:32:38,620 --> 02:32:41,140

2029
02:32:41,140 --> 02:32:43,300

02:32:54,500 --> 02:32:56,900

2040
02:33:04,260 --> 02:33:07,260
You can even get me started, I'll be here like until next week.

2041
02:33:07,260 --> 02:33:08,260
Alright, alright.

2042
02:33:08,260 --> 02:33:09,260
Have a safe drive.

2043
02:33:09,260 --> 02:33:10,260
Bye.

2044
02:33:10,260 --> 02:33:11,260
Yeah, I know.

2045
02:33:11,260 --> 02:33:12,260
Get her started.

2046
02:33:12,260 --> 02:33:13,260
Enjoy Boba.

2047
02:33:13,260 --> 02:33:14,260
Bye.

2048
02:33:14,260 --> 02:33:15,260
Bye.

2049
02:33:15,260 --> 02:33:16,260
Anyway.

2050
02:33:16,260 --> 02:33:23,260
So, um, I was at Virgin Megastore this week.

2051
02:33:23,260 --> 02:33:26,260
No, I'm not a virgin.

2052
02:33:26,260 --> 02:33:27,260
Sharkstar?

2053
02:33:27,260 --> 02:33:28,260
No, I'm kidding.

2054
02:33:28,260 --> 02:33:29,260
I love you.

2055
02:33:29,260 --> 02:33:30,260
Bye.

2056
02:33:30,260 --> 02:33:33,260
Um, I went to a Virgin Megastore this week and I was doing some shopping and I picked

2057
02:33:33,260 --> 02:33:38,580
I picked this up. This is pretty cool. I picked up the single for Drifting Away. Lang featuring

2058
02:33:38,580 --> 02:33:41,680
Skywood drifting away the single. Here, I'll put this up on Cam. Well, I can't put up on

2059
02:33:41,680 --> 02:33:46,720
Cam for another 50 seconds when it refreshes, but it's an interesting little background

2060
02:33:46,720 --> 02:33:51,360
picture, just a little sunset. It has four tracks. It has the radio edit, which you probably

2061
02:33:51,360 --> 02:33:56,080
are all familiar with, the original 12-inch mix, a Beam versus Cyrus remix, which sucks

2062
02:33:56,080 --> 02:34:00,760
balls, and the Lang sunset dub, which is okay. But I saw that it was kind of neat to walk

2063
02:34:00,760 --> 02:34:05,860
talking to the store and it was like, ooh, a Bimani single, because I didn't think this

2064
02:34:05,860 --> 02:34:09,560
song had actually been released in the U.S. So that was kind of a pleasant surprise.

2065
02:34:09,560 --> 02:34:13,560
Are you sure that's not an import? I don't think so. It didn't have the little

2066
02:34:13,560 --> 02:34:17,680
import sticker on it. And you know what's cool is it's put out by Radical Records who

2067
02:34:17,680 --> 02:34:22,360
did that time after time CD, if I remember right. Yes? I'm not sure. Anyway, I'll put

2068
02:34:22,360 --> 02:34:26,540
this up on the cams, I guess, and see what this CD looks like. So I picked it up. I don't

2069
02:34:26,540 --> 02:34:37,940
believe this is an import, but who knows. I think I got it blurry. Oh well, forget it.

2070
02:34:37,940 --> 02:34:38,940
I can't hold my hands still.

2071
02:34:38,940 --> 02:34:39,940
That's the deal.

2072
02:34:39,940 --> 02:34:45,400
Yeah, deal with it. So that's on the cam if you want to see what that looks like. It's

2073
02:34:45,400 --> 02:34:46,400
902.

2074
02:34:46,400 --> 02:34:47,400
Wow.

2075
02:34:47,400 --> 02:34:50,500
I know, we're cruising through the show here. Is there anything you wanted to bring up?

2076
02:34:50,500 --> 02:34:51,500
No.

2077
02:34:51,500 --> 02:34:54,160
Yeah, I guess we could do Ask Orange Lounge.

2078
02:34:54,160 --> 02:34:55,160
You can see it clearly.

2079
02:34:55,160 --> 02:34:58,160
Yeah, you can see it clearly enough on the cam.

2080
02:34:58,160 --> 02:35:00,160
If you want to ask Orange Lounge a question...

2081
02:35:00,160 --> 02:35:02,160
Actually, I want to bring up something.

2082
02:35:02,160 --> 02:35:07,160
Okay, well, before you bring that up, bring it up.

2083
02:35:07,160 --> 02:35:09,160
Send in your questions in the chat room.

2084
02:35:09,160 --> 02:35:11,160
Send a private message to Sky for Ask Orange Lounge,

2085
02:35:11,160 --> 02:35:14,160
and we'll get to that right after Jamie brings up.

2086
02:35:14,160 --> 02:35:15,160
My plug.

2087
02:35:15,160 --> 02:35:16,160
Okay.

2088
02:35:16,160 --> 02:35:20,160
Well, besides, you know, of course, my lovely, beautiful Tuesday night show,

2089
02:35:20,160 --> 02:35:23,160
which we haven't talked about our shows,

2090
02:35:23,160 --> 02:35:29,000
I would like to bring up that I have a new forum for people who are into gaming of all

2091
02:35:29,000 --> 02:35:30,000
kinds.

2092
02:35:30,000 --> 02:35:31,000
It's at roleplay.darksakura.com.

2093
02:35:31,000 --> 02:35:32,000
Sign up.

2094
02:35:32,000 --> 02:35:39,800
I run, basically, there's going to be free form games from there.

2095
02:35:39,800 --> 02:35:45,520
If you want to run a game using the message board system, send me a private message and

2096
02:35:45,520 --> 02:35:46,520
I'll get your game set up.

2097
02:35:46,520 --> 02:35:51,920
Get you set up as moderator for your forum, for your group, and we'll get you set up.

2098
02:35:51,920 --> 02:35:55,280
You know we have different game discussions different types of games

2099
02:35:55,280 --> 02:36:00,080
So if you there's a game that you want to have an open discussion on let me know just sign up for your account

2100
02:36:00,080 --> 02:36:02,080
And we'll set you up

2101
02:36:02,120 --> 02:36:04,120
It's that easy

2102
02:36:08,040 --> 02:36:12,560
Also since you brought up Tuesday show let's give a plug for all our spin-off shows on the

2103
02:36:14,480 --> 02:36:18,620
Okay Tuesday, I'll start with any I should start with Monday. Yes

2104
02:36:18,620 --> 02:36:20,620
Yeah, you still want to go first.

2105
02:36:20,620 --> 02:36:21,620
Yeah, I know.

2106
02:36:21,620 --> 02:36:26,980
Monday nights is Vanilla Sky, and originally I was going to have a rotating panel, I was

2107
02:36:26,980 --> 02:36:30,340
going to have different people in here every week, but Brad and Irene have worked out so

2108
02:36:30,340 --> 02:36:34,660
well that they're just here, pretty much the perma-co-hosts on Vanilla Sky, where we talk

2109
02:36:34,660 --> 02:36:41,220
about everything kind of like, we talk about other game stuff, and then we talk about things

2110
02:36:41,220 --> 02:36:42,220
outside of that.

2111
02:36:42,220 --> 02:36:45,140
We talk about what's going on in the real world, also outside your computer, from a

2112
02:36:45,140 --> 02:36:50,060
nerdy point of view definitely and we do such crazy antics as I guess the Yahoo

2113
02:36:50,060 --> 02:36:54,460
Talkback because people on Yahoo are stupid and we do of course bad music and

2114
02:36:54,460 --> 02:36:58,900
video game trivia have you listened to bad music and video game trivia yet

2115
02:36:58,900 --> 02:37:05,180
Jamie no it's exciting what I do is I give video game trivia I question Brad

2116
02:37:05,180 --> 02:37:09,420
and Irene on a certain topic like last week it was racing games was topic I

2117
02:37:09,420 --> 02:37:13,940
quiz them on racing games and for every question they get wrong we bring up the

2118
02:37:13,940 --> 02:37:18,540
the volume of some bad music, like last week was Barbra Streisand music.

2119
02:37:18,540 --> 02:37:22,500
Barbra Streisand is cool.

2120
02:37:22,500 --> 02:37:25,620
No matter what I pick, somebody always goes, but I like that person.

2121
02:37:25,620 --> 02:37:30,460
The first week it was Enya, then it was Celine Dion, and somebody goes, Celine Dion, yeah.

2122
02:37:30,460 --> 02:37:31,460
So you know whatever.

2123
02:37:31,460 --> 02:37:34,900
Celine Dion has only done one good song and it was Meat Loaf.

2124
02:37:34,900 --> 02:37:36,740
We talk a lot about Puzzle Pirates too.

2125
02:37:36,740 --> 02:37:38,660
It's kind of turning into a Puzzle Pirates show almost.

2126
02:37:38,660 --> 02:37:40,940
You don't play Ragnarok with me anymore.

2127
02:37:40,940 --> 02:37:42,380
Because I didn't renew my account.

2128
02:37:42,380 --> 02:37:45,060
I'm waiting for that other thing.

2129
02:37:45,060 --> 02:37:46,660
Well, renew for another month and play with me.

2130
02:37:46,660 --> 02:37:51,180
I'm waiting for the dyslexic rolo fan club to open up.

2131
02:37:51,180 --> 02:37:52,100
That's all.

2132
02:37:52,100 --> 02:37:53,700
Renew your account and play with me.

2133
02:37:53,700 --> 02:37:54,980
I'll think about it.

2134
02:37:54,980 --> 02:37:56,380
But I like Puzzle Pirates a lot.

2135
02:37:56,380 --> 02:37:59,220
So that's it.

2136
02:37:59,220 --> 02:38:02,200
That's what you can look for on my show.

2137
02:38:02,200 --> 02:38:02,860
Tuesday nights.

2138
02:38:02,860 --> 02:38:03,700
My show is Tuesday.

2139
02:38:03,700 --> 02:38:06,020
It's basically, it's our request.

2140
02:38:06,020 --> 02:38:08,860
It's called Pump Up the Volume because I'm

2141
02:38:08,860 --> 02:38:12,340
a big 80s nerd fan.

2142
02:38:12,340 --> 02:38:16,620
So it starts at 730, although I have a 7 o'clock pre-show,

2143
02:38:16,620 --> 02:38:20,020
because I usually just have that on while I go to the bathroom.

2144
02:38:20,020 --> 02:38:21,380
Oh, did I say that on the air?

2145
02:38:21,380 --> 02:38:23,420
My dad.

2146
02:38:23,420 --> 02:38:27,380
But no, it starts at 730, unless you want

2147
02:38:27,380 --> 02:38:29,100
to catch the pre-show beforehand.

2148
02:38:29,100 --> 02:38:31,180
I play request, so I hardly talk,

2149
02:38:31,180 --> 02:38:33,820
so you don't have to listen to my crappy voice.

2150
02:38:33,820 --> 02:38:36,160
I sometimes talk, discuss things.

2151
02:38:36,160 --> 02:38:37,940
I'd like to have a guest, but no one ever

2152
02:38:37,940 --> 02:38:39,480
wants to come hang out with me on Tuesday.

2153
02:38:39,480 --> 02:38:41,780
I'd come some way, but you have me on this show.

2154
02:38:41,780 --> 02:38:42,780
You have me on this show.

2155
02:38:42,780 --> 02:38:43,780
Yeah, I don't need you on that.

2156
02:38:43,780 --> 02:38:48,900
You need to get some other, you don't have other, you need to get, you need to get Shark

2157
02:38:48,900 --> 02:38:51,020
Scroll or, I don't know.

2158
02:38:51,020 --> 02:38:53,020
I'll try to arrange a guest.

2159
02:38:53,020 --> 02:38:54,020
Get Dan.

2160
02:38:54,020 --> 02:38:55,020
Dan's working Tuesday nights.

2161
02:38:55,020 --> 02:38:58,020
That's why I do the show Tuesday.

2162
02:38:58,020 --> 02:39:01,580
But if you're in our chat room, then you can send me a private message that night and I

2163
02:39:01,580 --> 02:39:06,060
will play anything that you want, if I have it, or something by the same group.

2164
02:39:06,060 --> 02:39:08,940
Unless you request like Spice Girls.

2165
02:39:08,940 --> 02:39:10,940
I played Vitamin C.

2166
02:39:10,940 --> 02:39:13,860
Vitamin C's Corvo.

2167
02:39:13,860 --> 02:39:17,220
There's just very few things that are on my I Will Not playlist.

2168
02:39:17,220 --> 02:39:21,540
And usually, that's a couple of songs.

2169
02:39:21,540 --> 02:39:23,180
I want to hear Dirty.

2170
02:39:23,180 --> 02:39:24,340
And Dirty.

2171
02:39:24,340 --> 02:39:25,740
That won't be played on my show.

2172
02:39:25,740 --> 02:39:27,740
That song sucks.

2173
02:39:27,740 --> 02:39:30,060
By the way, I just have to say, at the depot last night,

2174
02:39:30,060 --> 02:39:32,860
I saw the video of that.

2175
02:39:32,860 --> 02:39:35,140
They played the video of the MTV Video Music Awards,

2176
02:39:35,140 --> 02:39:36,260
that whole little thing.

2177
02:39:36,260 --> 02:39:36,860
This is Richie?

2178
02:39:36,860 --> 02:39:37,380
Fabulous.

2179
02:39:37,380 --> 02:39:38,740
And you should have seen all the,

2180
02:39:38,740 --> 02:39:40,420
because this is a gay bar, you should have seen all the gay

2181
02:39:40,420 --> 02:39:44,580
guys reactions that it was great we're just all calling on say it's great it's

2182
02:39:44,580 --> 02:39:56,420
fun anyway yeah sorry but it lasts until 1030 and then that's usually the point

2183
02:39:56,420 --> 02:39:59,820
where I have to wait another 30 minutes for the right rock server to come back

2184
02:39:59,820 --> 02:40:05,100
on so I can play more right rock like the addicts I am and it's it's fun I

2185
02:40:05,100 --> 02:40:08,780
figured that's a chat room I figured that's why you did your show Tuesday

2186
02:40:08,780 --> 02:40:13,980
night because that was RO maintenance night. This Tuesday though, I was going to be doing

2187
02:40:13,980 --> 02:40:20,340
video game music trivia again, but I won't be able to do it because I'm going to be talking

2188
02:40:20,340 --> 02:40:25,260
as little as possible. I'm trying to let my lungs recover.

2189
02:40:25,260 --> 02:40:31,660
Which is different than the video game music trivia I'm doing because she's literally video

2190
02:40:31,660 --> 02:40:38,660
game music trivia. I have multiple questions style, so if you

2191
02:40:38,660 --> 02:40:42,620
guess what it's from what level it's from give me as much as you know about

2192
02:40:42,620 --> 02:40:48,100
this music you'll get a point for it cool so your nerdiness pays off because

2193
02:40:48,100 --> 02:40:51,540
I'll give you a dollar if you win it pays to get points of dark savory

2194
02:40:51,540 --> 02:40:59,420
somebody somebody dethrone dark test yet please and then we have our Wednesday

2195
02:40:59,420 --> 02:41:06,420
show bacon man actually Wednesdays is condition zero but zero didn't make it

2196
02:41:06,420 --> 02:41:10,340
last week so I don't know he's got another week otherwise we may be looking

2197
02:41:10,340 --> 02:41:14,660
for something else to put on Wednesdays sorry but if he this is two weeks in a

2198
02:41:14,660 --> 02:41:18,660
row I'm just if he misses two weeks in a row I'm just going to assume he doesn't

2199
02:41:18,660 --> 02:41:25,660
want to do it we'll think of something creative for Wednesday I do have a

2200
02:41:25,660 --> 02:41:34,980
backup show that's ready to go not a live show though I will see okay my show

2201
02:41:34,980 --> 02:41:43,900
Livewire, every Thursday, 7 o'clock. Hour long pre-show. Usually, I've been doing now

2202
02:41:43,900 --> 02:41:51,140
like the show before, kind of replaying the show previous to it. And this week on Livewire

2203
02:41:51,140 --> 02:41:56,260
we're going to be doing kind of like a non-stop of every single Livewire so far, all five

2204
02:41:56,260 --> 02:42:01,100
shows because it's my birthday and I'm not going to be here to do this. So I'm going

2205
02:42:01,100 --> 02:42:07,320
to have them all remixed together. Basically, I'm just going to redo every set without my

2206
02:42:07,320 --> 02:42:13,420
voice on it and mix together better. So, you know, have those and you'll get to hear them

2207
02:42:13,420 --> 02:42:18,860
non-stop and at the very end, there'll be something special for you listeners who stay

2208
02:42:18,860 --> 02:42:24,980
tuned. It was going to be a new Loki remix, but I played that tonight, so it might be

2209
02:42:24,980 --> 02:42:25,980
...

2210
02:42:25,980 --> 02:42:26,980
He blew his wad.

2211
02:42:26,980 --> 02:42:30,300
No, it might be another one. I don't know. We'll see.

2212
02:42:30,300 --> 02:42:42,340
I would like to see a strung together mix of all Dark Sakura has a show, Tuesday night.

2213
02:42:42,340 --> 02:42:44,260
That's what she was just talking about.

2214
02:42:44,260 --> 02:42:47,980
Thursday night's live wire, yes.

2215
02:42:47,980 --> 02:42:53,820
Yeah, so we might do a little something special at the end there for those who tune in for

2216
02:42:53,820 --> 02:42:57,420
the long, long set of music that's going to be there.

2217
02:42:57,420 --> 02:43:05,940
I'm starting the show earlier this week. It's going to be at six because it's so long. There's

2218
02:43:05,940 --> 02:43:10,060
a lot of cool sets in there. There's the first one, which is just generic trance stuff. Second

2219
02:43:10,060 --> 02:43:15,020
set, which is old school music, 70s and 80s remixes, which is really sweet. Then there's

2220
02:43:15,020 --> 02:43:24,540
also, what was it? Week two was a darker trance music. Week three was old school stuff. Week

2221
02:43:24,540 --> 02:43:32,340
before was Livewire, the motion picture score, kind of like a score-type music. And then

2222
02:43:32,340 --> 02:43:40,420
last week's, which was Fuck the RIAA, which was independent indie artists versus commercial

2223
02:43:40,420 --> 02:43:42,060
artists, and it was pretty sweet.

2224
02:43:42,060 --> 02:43:49,060
Very cool. Livewire is such a great show, it's getting me into mixing, even. And I did

2225
02:43:49,060 --> 02:43:54,420
a megamix that I played after Vanilla Sky one week. And if I do it more regularly, I

2226
02:43:54,420 --> 02:43:58,520
might find some spare time on the station to air. I'm like on a Saturday afternoon or

2227
02:43:58,520 --> 02:44:04,740
something, but who knows? I don't want to take any thunder away from Loki, but he's

2228
02:44:04,740 --> 02:44:08,900
way better at it than I am. He can do it on the fly better than I can.

2229
02:44:08,900 --> 02:44:14,580
Yeah, and I really do literally on the fly because the last few weeks I've been really

2230
02:44:14,580 --> 02:44:18,920
slacking on getting my show together, and I literally, I'm working on the show until

2231
02:44:18,920 --> 02:44:22,740
like the last three seconds. Literally, so.

2232
02:44:22,740 --> 02:44:24,180
All right, so Orange Lounge Radio.

2233
02:44:24,180 --> 02:44:26,940
Live programming every Sunday through Thursday night.

2234
02:44:26,940 --> 02:44:29,060
Well, Wednesdays are questionable recently,

2235
02:44:29,060 --> 02:44:29,860
but we'll see.

2236
02:44:29,860 --> 02:44:31,180
We're going to work on that.

2237
02:44:31,180 --> 02:44:34,620
Anyway, as promised, you guys can ask us questions now.

2238
02:44:34,620 --> 02:44:36,660
It's Ask Orange Lounge.

2239
02:44:36,660 --> 02:44:39,380
So if you want to ask us a question,

2240
02:44:39,380 --> 02:44:43,100
head on to our chat room, www.calibomani.com,

2241
02:44:43,100 --> 02:44:46,100
click on Orange Lounge, and click on Chat.

2242
02:44:46,100 --> 02:44:50,460
And you can ask myself, Loki, or Jamie any question you want.

2243
02:44:50,460 --> 02:44:53,460
it's one of our favorite segments to do on the show especially when we're

2244
02:44:53,460 --> 02:44:56,060
desperate for filler material which was off

2245
02:44:56,060 --> 02:44:57,540
excuse me often

2246
02:44:57,540 --> 02:45:02,540
especially in a slow bimani newsweek as it has been lately

2247
02:45:02,540 --> 02:45:06,140
uh... what day of the week is max two supposed to come out twenty fourth right

2248
02:45:06,140 --> 02:45:08,640
that's a wednesday

2249
02:45:08,640 --> 02:45:10,820
we might be doing something uh...

2250
02:45:10,820 --> 02:45:13,380
we'll have to do something a day that max two comes out just to add that in there

2251
02:45:13,380 --> 02:45:14,680
anyway

2252
02:45:14,680 --> 02:45:21,680
let's talk about orange lounge, or ask orange lounge

2253
02:45:24,220 --> 02:45:26,040
let's ask orange lounge

2254
02:45:26,040 --> 02:45:27,960
some stupid question

2255
02:45:27,960 --> 02:45:33,760
who will get yelled at this week on orange lounge, asks segment

2256
02:45:33,760 --> 02:45:35,260
da da da da

2257
02:45:35,260 --> 02:45:37,700
i like cheese, i like milk

2258
02:45:37,700 --> 02:45:39,900
they give me gas, alright

2259
02:45:39,900 --> 02:45:43,100
i'm gonna do something by the way

2260
02:45:43,100 --> 02:45:45,620
That I haven't done in a year.

2261
02:45:45,620 --> 02:45:48,060
You're gonna eat bacon? Two years.

2262
02:45:48,060 --> 02:45:49,820
I'm going to eat bacon.

2263
02:45:49,820 --> 02:45:54,820
His bacon is yummy.

2264
02:45:54,820 --> 02:46:00,900
Now I know why I don't eat pork anymore.

2265
02:46:00,900 --> 02:46:07,580
I'm just hungry and sick.

2266
02:46:07,580 --> 02:46:15,300
First question, Evil Naoki 2DX, oh, it's a shameless plug, it's not an ask question,

2267
02:46:15,300 --> 02:46:22,460
it's just a shameless plug. Here it is. Japantown Anime Fair is this weekend at San Francisco's

2268
02:46:22,460 --> 02:46:32,820
Japantown. It's at the Radisson Miyako Hotel and the Best Western Miyako Inn. Only $12

2269
02:46:32,820 --> 02:46:34,740
for the weekend or $8 for one day.

2270
02:46:34,740 --> 02:46:40,620
You want more info, www.jtaf.com for more info.

2271
02:46:40,620 --> 02:46:43,020
Let me know if you need me to work.

2272
02:46:43,020 --> 02:46:43,500
I will.

2273
02:46:43,500 --> 02:46:45,060
I'll cosplay there.

2274
02:46:45,060 --> 02:46:48,340
In my bike-in costume.

2275
02:46:48,340 --> 02:46:49,500
23rd Magus.

2276
02:46:49,500 --> 02:46:54,300
Loki, how would you go about setting an initial demachine

2277
02:46:54,300 --> 02:46:55,260
on fire?

2278
02:46:55,260 --> 02:46:58,780
I need help on my technique.

2279
02:46:58,780 --> 02:47:00,180
Gas.

2280
02:47:00,180 --> 02:47:01,460
Fire.

2281
02:47:01,460 --> 02:47:14,580
I think if I eat any more of my arteries, they're seriously going to be clogged.

2282
02:47:14,580 --> 02:47:17,420
I'm running out of food, so that means I have to take my diet pretty soon.

2283
02:47:17,420 --> 02:47:21,140
Except I have a huge thing of mashed potatoes in there, so I have to go through those first.

2284
02:47:21,140 --> 02:47:22,540
I don't need to eat any more bacon.

2285
02:47:22,540 --> 02:47:25,940
I think my mouth is catching SARS or something.

2286
02:47:25,940 --> 02:47:27,780
Our kitchen's all full of grease.

2287
02:47:27,780 --> 02:47:29,420
I'm going to have some more V8.

2288
02:47:29,420 --> 02:47:32,260
Here, hold this.

2289
02:47:32,260 --> 02:47:34,160
So gasoline in a match.

2290
02:47:34,160 --> 02:47:34,660
Yeah.

2291
02:47:34,660 --> 02:47:37,340
That would be my advice, too.

2292
02:47:37,340 --> 02:47:39,780
Late at night when no one's working, you have to excuse me.

2293
02:47:39,780 --> 02:47:41,140
I have a mouth full of bacon.

2294
02:47:41,140 --> 02:47:42,940
Or if you want, what you should do

2295
02:47:42,940 --> 02:47:46,220
is pour gas over the circuitry and then leave it.

2296
02:47:46,220 --> 02:47:48,500
So when they turn it on and the game boots up,

2297
02:47:48,500 --> 02:47:51,940
then it catches on fire and blows up.

2298
02:47:51,940 --> 02:47:53,940
Well, fine.

2299
02:47:53,940 --> 02:47:57,060
We need that safe home stuff that we have in the campaign.

2300
02:47:57,060 --> 02:47:57,700
Yeah.

2301
02:47:57,700 --> 02:47:59,020
Better than that.

2302
02:47:59,020 --> 02:48:02,440
Just go in the little cabinet where you sit in to play the game

2303
02:48:02,440 --> 02:48:06,540
and take a dump. It's the worst than setting the machine on fire.

2304
02:48:06,540 --> 02:48:09,700
They need that blue napalm stuff that we had when we went camping.

2305
02:48:09,700 --> 02:48:14,280
Because that stuff is cool.

2306
02:48:14,280 --> 02:48:15,580
Jason,

2307
02:48:15,580 --> 02:48:17,160
our friend Jason,

2308
02:48:17,160 --> 02:48:20,500
would like to know, he says, although I can't hear the answer,

2309
02:48:20,500 --> 02:48:24,340
why? Why aren't you listening? Why? What is wrong with you?

2310
02:48:24,340 --> 02:48:29,740
He'd like to ask OrangeLounge, why does this weekend feel so angsty-like?

2311
02:48:29,740 --> 02:48:36,740
I don't know. I don't feel angsty. I don't know. I don't have your fucking problems.

2312
02:48:37,160 --> 02:48:38,340
You're too tired to feel angsty.

2313
02:48:38,340 --> 02:48:42,700
I really am. It sounds like Sylvester Stallone. Well, Jason,

2314
02:48:42,700 --> 02:48:48,300
you're probably angsty because of where you live.

2315
02:48:48,300 --> 02:48:49,620
I'm so mean.

2316
02:48:49,620 --> 02:48:54,180
Come to California. It's nice here.

2317
02:48:54,180 --> 02:48:56,860
Yeah, we have a good political system.

2318
02:48:56,860 --> 02:49:00,140
Baca says, I love Orange Lounge.

2319
02:49:00,140 --> 02:49:01,420
Aw, how nice.

2320
02:49:01,420 --> 02:49:02,940
There was no question there, though.

2321
02:49:02,940 --> 02:49:04,260
What did you get?

2322
02:49:04,260 --> 02:49:05,540
What were you talking about?

2323
02:49:05,540 --> 02:49:06,540
Hey, what did you get?

2324
02:49:06,540 --> 02:49:07,580
He, he, silly me.

2325
02:49:07,580 --> 02:49:10,140
I'm getting all these little bits and pieces of a message

2326
02:49:10,140 --> 02:49:11,180
here.

2327
02:49:11,180 --> 02:49:12,780
No question, though.

2328
02:49:12,780 --> 02:49:15,060
I'm really interested to see if the rain comes out

2329
02:49:15,060 --> 02:49:16,260
because I forgot my clothes.

2330
02:49:16,260 --> 02:49:17,780
So we'll move on to DCB.

2331
02:49:17,780 --> 02:49:20,340
Hi, guys.

2332
02:49:20,340 --> 02:49:22,260
Oh, this is interesting.

2333
02:49:22,260 --> 02:49:24,700
DCB wants to know every cast member's opinion on this.

2334
02:49:24,700 --> 02:49:29,460
Who is outright cooler, Al Roker or Bob Saget?

2335
02:49:29,460 --> 02:49:32,460
And which one would you rather have live at your house?

2336
02:49:32,460 --> 02:49:33,780
Loki.

2337
02:49:33,780 --> 02:49:36,300
Al Roker is the weather guy on the Today Show.

2338
02:49:36,300 --> 02:49:38,380
It's going to rain.

2339
02:49:38,380 --> 02:49:40,260
I don't watch TV, thank you.

2340
02:49:40,260 --> 02:49:42,420
Al Roker had his stomach stapled,

2341
02:49:42,420 --> 02:49:43,900
and now he looks really thin.

2342
02:49:43,900 --> 02:49:45,300
It's kind of scary.

2343
02:49:45,300 --> 02:49:49,180
But Bob Saget's cool because, one, he played a stoner

2344
02:49:49,180 --> 02:49:56,180
in

2345
02:49:57,600 --> 02:50:00,920
he's shit all over my bathroom there's shit everywhere

2346
02:50:00,920 --> 02:50:04,780
there's shit on the mirror there's shit here

2347
02:50:04,780 --> 02:50:08,460
i would also have to say that Bobs as much as i love Al Roker

2348
02:50:08,460 --> 02:50:11,900
Bobs Saggit is cooler

2349
02:50:11,900 --> 02:50:17,560
because yeah i used to suck dick for coke

2350
02:50:17,560 --> 02:50:20,160
Who would I rather have live in the house, though?

2351
02:50:20,160 --> 02:50:21,160
Al Roker.

2352
02:50:21,160 --> 02:50:22,160
I'd rather have Al Roker live in the house.

2353
02:50:22,160 --> 02:50:23,160
Why?

2354
02:50:23,160 --> 02:50:25,640
Bob Saget used to clean up everything.

2355
02:50:25,640 --> 02:50:27,680
But Al Roker can predict the weather.

2356
02:50:27,680 --> 02:50:29,040
Yeah, right.

2357
02:50:29,040 --> 02:50:30,040
Uh-huh.

2358
02:50:30,040 --> 02:50:31,840
Like he can predict his diet.

2359
02:50:31,840 --> 02:50:32,840
You know what?

2360
02:50:32,840 --> 02:50:35,240
It doesn't matter which one's chosen because the moment they set foot in my house, legally

2361
02:50:35,240 --> 02:50:37,840
I can shoot them.

2362
02:50:37,840 --> 02:50:44,480
Did you hear about this, Jamie, about this news story about the guy who tried to rob

2363
02:50:44,480 --> 02:50:48,320
the bank, and he had that explosive collar around his neck?

2364
02:50:48,320 --> 02:50:51,960
I know, that was cool! I'd do that.

2365
02:50:51,960 --> 02:50:54,040
His real life battle royale.

2366
02:50:54,040 --> 02:50:59,660
Except it wasn't like all contained, it was like wired. But still.

2367
02:50:59,660 --> 02:51:02,560
Hey, it's a step in the right direction.

2368
02:51:02,560 --> 02:51:06,020
All they need to do is just compact it and put it on children.

2369
02:51:06,020 --> 02:51:06,700
Yes.

2370
02:51:06,700 --> 02:51:08,120
That'd make me happy.

2371
02:51:08,120 --> 02:51:09,580
I didn't find you in class.

2372
02:51:09,580 --> 02:51:13,500
Now Susie, if you want to live, you better get this math question correctly.

2373
02:51:13,500 --> 02:51:16,820
You're acting up in class, remote control.

2374
02:51:16,820 --> 02:51:21,940
Beep, beep, beep. Everybody better run.

2375
02:51:21,940 --> 02:51:26,140
Maple speaks and is asking us a question.

2376
02:51:26,140 --> 02:51:30,060
Gasp. First he wants to know, how do I go about listening?

2377
02:51:30,060 --> 02:51:33,300
Well, it's easy.

2378
02:51:33,300 --> 02:51:36,740
You know what, if you're here, you're obviously listening, but

2379
02:51:36,740 --> 02:51:40,500
In case you forget, you can always go to, and I'll send this over private message to

2380
02:51:40,500 --> 02:51:50,220
Maple, just in case you really isn't listening. You can go to our website. It's at orangelounge.sky.cx,

2381
02:51:50,220 --> 02:51:55,220
but not for much longer. Hopefully, only one more week on that. Right? Right, kids?

2382
02:51:55,220 --> 02:51:57,060
Hey, someone was supposed to be working on that website.

2383
02:51:57,060 --> 02:52:01,060
Yeah, well, it didn't happen. I was too busy sucking dick for coke.

2384
02:52:01,060 --> 02:52:05,580
Here, coke head. See, I told you that it was, it looks like a drug market.

2385
02:52:05,580 --> 02:52:06,580
Diet Coke!

2386
02:52:06,580 --> 02:52:12,340
Anyway, Mabel would also like to know, why am I so cool?

2387
02:52:12,340 --> 02:52:15,740
Oh, he ate a nasty piece of the bacon.

2388
02:52:15,740 --> 02:52:16,900
Loki choked on bacon?

2389
02:52:16,900 --> 02:52:18,660
Why does that ask that question?

2390
02:52:18,660 --> 02:52:20,220
No, it wasn't a choke on bacon.

2391
02:52:20,220 --> 02:52:22,700
It was a piece of the seasoning stuff I got,

2392
02:52:22,700 --> 02:52:25,780
and there was like nice crunchy, charcoal-y taste.

2393
02:52:25,780 --> 02:52:27,780
I was like, oh, oh.

2394
02:52:27,780 --> 02:52:30,700
It's nasty bacon.

2395
02:52:30,700 --> 02:52:32,220
Oh, water.

2396
02:52:32,220 --> 02:52:33,660
Loki's got that nasty bacon.

2397
02:52:33,660 --> 02:52:37,660
Mabel wants to know why he's so cool.

2398
02:52:37,660 --> 02:52:42,860
If you got the ice cubes out of your pants, maybe you wouldn't be.

2399
02:52:42,860 --> 02:52:44,820
I like that answer.

2400
02:52:44,820 --> 02:52:46,060
I am done with the bacon.

2401
02:52:46,060 --> 02:52:47,620
Bacon is done.

2402
02:52:47,620 --> 02:52:50,980
Mabel's cool because he's really laid back.

2403
02:52:50,980 --> 02:52:52,500
He's a laid back guy.

2404
02:52:52,500 --> 02:52:53,000
I like that.

2405
02:53:00,780 --> 02:53:02,280
Moving on, John Fields would like

2406
02:53:02,280 --> 02:53:06,080
There's no little kids that run across the DDR pads.

2407
02:53:06,080 --> 02:53:10,120
What would you do to them if you didn't get in trouble for it?

2408
02:53:10,120 --> 02:53:11,120
Trip them.

2409
02:53:11,120 --> 02:53:15,160
I do all the time.

2410
02:53:15,160 --> 02:53:18,720
I would push them down a flight of stairs.

2411
02:53:18,720 --> 02:53:23,040
I would hang them by hooks through their skin on their back, and then I'd pour hot oil on

2412
02:53:23,040 --> 02:53:27,880
their back, and then after they kept screaming, I'd stick sharp needles through their chin

2413
02:53:27,880 --> 02:53:32,760
them through the sides of their cheeks and then through their chest. No, tell us how

2414
02:53:32,760 --> 02:53:41,040
you really feel. Of course, I was taken from Eat You to Kill Her, awesome movie. Then I'd

2415
02:53:41,040 --> 02:53:50,240
cut off their nipples. Baka would like to admit he is random. We figured that out. Baka

2416
02:53:50,240 --> 02:53:56,120
would also like us to define its definition time. Define angst.

2417
02:53:56,120 --> 02:54:13,200
Alright, do this, Rob. Go pull up Internet Explorer, type in www.dictionary.com. Type

2418
02:54:13,200 --> 02:54:22,480
the word angst angst by definition a feeling of anxiety or apprehension often

2419
02:54:22,480 --> 02:54:28,120
accompanied by depression that's what angst means and now you know and knowing

2420
02:54:28,120 --> 02:54:36,120
is half the battle go Joe now this well here's the second part define for who

2421
02:54:36,120 --> 02:54:42,120
That's the sound you make after I kick your ass.

2422
02:54:42,120 --> 02:54:49,120
That's the sound of Jamie's leg going right at your balls.

2423
02:54:49,120 --> 02:54:56,120
That's my Japanese porn star name.

2424
02:54:56,120 --> 02:55:01,120
That's my Japanese porn star name.

2425
02:55:01,120 --> 02:55:04,080
See, you don't know it's me because I'm all mosaic-ed out,

2426
02:55:04,080 --> 02:55:06,760
but that's me.

2427
02:55:06,760 --> 02:55:09,800
I'm a stunt cock.

2428
02:55:09,800 --> 02:55:12,920
We're out of questions.

2429
02:55:12,920 --> 02:55:17,880
Does anybody in the room have a question for somebody else?

2430
02:55:17,880 --> 02:55:24,280
Dear chat room, why do I own you so much for free?

2431
02:55:24,280 --> 02:55:27,760
Dear chat room, I look at my PayPal account every day,

2432
02:55:27,760 --> 02:55:29,280
and there's no other money in there.

2433
02:55:29,280 --> 02:55:32,960
Why hasn't anyone given me money?

2434
02:55:32,960 --> 02:55:37,080
Nightmare underscore Hunter.

2435
02:55:37,080 --> 02:55:39,520
Why would none of you let me pimp you out?

2436
02:55:39,520 --> 02:55:40,640
We got questions.

2437
02:55:40,640 --> 02:55:41,680
We're saved.

2438
02:55:41,680 --> 02:55:43,760
OK.

2439
02:55:43,760 --> 02:55:49,680
Maple would like to know, only who can prevent forest fires?

2440
02:55:49,680 --> 02:55:50,600
Not me.

2441
02:55:50,600 --> 02:55:54,080
Shit, I scarred him.

2442
02:55:54,080 --> 02:55:57,440
Actually, I actually used to live, or I kind of live,

2443
02:55:57,440 --> 02:55:59,420
We kind of live in the middle of a forest, right?

2444
02:55:59,420 --> 02:56:02,020
And there was that fire just two blocks down the street

2445
02:56:02,020 --> 02:56:02,960
a couple weeks ago.

2446
02:56:02,960 --> 02:56:05,220
So the fire department can prevent forest fires

2447
02:56:05,220 --> 02:56:06,300
from consuming your home.

2448
02:56:06,300 --> 02:56:10,580
Because if they hadn't acted so fast, we could have been dead.

2449
02:56:10,580 --> 02:56:11,420
No, we were at work.

2450
02:56:11,420 --> 02:56:13,700
If a bear tried to prevent forest fires,

2451
02:56:13,700 --> 02:56:16,740
he would just get consumed in the flames and die.

2452
02:56:16,740 --> 02:56:19,140
Only God can prevent forest fires.

2453
02:56:19,140 --> 02:56:22,280
Start praying, children.

2454
02:56:22,280 --> 02:56:25,220
All of a sudden, this is a religious show.

2455
02:56:25,220 --> 02:56:29,620
I know Live 365 had a lot of religious stations, but shit.

2456
02:56:29,620 --> 02:56:33,660
We need to do that thing where we go on to other Live 365

2457
02:56:33,660 --> 02:56:35,980
stations, like the Christian Rock channels and things like

2458
02:56:35,980 --> 02:56:36,900
that, and make fun of them.

2459
02:56:36,900 --> 02:56:38,900
Listen to them and make fun of them.

2460
02:56:38,900 --> 02:56:42,140
Maybe another time.

2461
02:56:42,140 --> 02:56:43,860
I can do that.

2462
02:56:43,860 --> 02:56:49,220
DCB would like to know, why do women have boobs?

2463
02:56:49,220 --> 02:56:51,220
He has an answer, though, too.

2464
02:56:51,220 --> 02:56:52,620
So you have something to look at when

2465
02:56:52,620 --> 02:56:55,060
you're talking to them.

2466
02:56:55,060 --> 02:57:02,060
If you could see Jamie's face.

2467
02:57:04,540 --> 02:57:10,420
I'm trying not to laugh.

2468
02:57:10,420 --> 02:57:12,420
See,

2469
02:57:12,420 --> 02:57:17,980
we have cushioning where you guys have targets.

2470
02:57:17,980 --> 02:57:21,940
Think about it.

2471
02:57:21,940 --> 02:57:27,540
I don't know, why do women have boobs? I mean, obviously the breast milk's there, but they

2472
02:57:27,540 --> 02:57:35,020
don't have to be so big some of the time. I mean, babies don't drink that much.

2473
02:57:35,020 --> 02:57:36,020
Estrogen! Hello?

2474
02:57:36,020 --> 02:57:38,380
Yeah, but still.

2475
02:57:38,380 --> 02:57:42,780
I'm talking like Jerry Springer boobs. Why do people get the boobs back?

2476
02:57:42,780 --> 02:57:45,220
What I understand is my nuts aren't that big, so I mean...

2477
02:57:45,220 --> 02:57:48,060
Yeah, that's true. Why can't my nuts be as big as women's boobs?

2478
02:57:48,060 --> 02:57:52,260
That would really hurt.

2479
02:57:52,260 --> 02:57:55,900
Having boobs does not hurt unless you have really big boobs and then your back hurts

2480
02:57:55,900 --> 02:57:56,900
all the time.

2481
02:57:56,900 --> 02:58:02,540
I'm not even going to get started on that one.

2482
02:58:02,540 --> 02:58:04,900
I know I have big boobs.

2483
02:58:04,900 --> 02:58:07,580
You have nice boobs.

2484
02:58:07,580 --> 02:58:08,580
You have nice boobs.

2485
02:58:08,580 --> 02:58:11,460
Don't look at my boobs.

2486
02:58:11,460 --> 02:58:12,460
It's okay.

2487
02:58:12,460 --> 02:58:13,460
He's no gay.

2488
02:58:13,460 --> 02:58:25,280
I know you have a boob fixation but I would say that when you get it like into

2489
02:58:25,280 --> 02:58:29,420
like the double D's and more that there were these women at my elementary school

2490
02:58:29,420 --> 02:58:33,660
I was so afraid of them because they had boobs that were as big as me when I was

2491
02:58:33,660 --> 02:58:41,220
five and that's the time to go save up your money and go get a boob job because

2492
02:58:41,220 --> 02:58:45,820
that's too heavy. When you have boobs large enough to hold matrix babies in them, that's

2493
02:58:45,820 --> 02:58:52,080
when you have to be concerned. Actually, I'm not kidding. They were that large. The ones

2494
02:58:52,080 --> 02:58:55,500
that get like the triple G. I don't get like, when I watched Geraldo one day, these women

2495
02:58:55,500 --> 02:59:01,140
were like expanding themselves as novelty models. What the hell's the point of it? You

2496
02:59:01,140 --> 02:59:06,140
know, why don't they like add squirrel tails or something like that. You know something

2497
02:59:06,140 --> 02:59:16,580
The people with small boobs who want big boobs, you know what, be happy with what you have

2498
02:59:16,580 --> 02:59:25,180
because having big boobs isn't everything except you get a lot more dates.

2499
02:59:25,180 --> 02:59:26,180
Questions from Maple.

2500
02:59:26,180 --> 02:59:28,180
I'm afraid to ask this one.

2501
02:59:28,180 --> 02:59:30,180
What is the best racist joke you know of?

2502
02:59:30,180 --> 02:59:34,180
I don't think we need to answer that one, although I'll turn it to Loki.

2503
02:59:34,180 --> 02:59:35,420
No, we're not going to answer that.

2504
02:59:35,420 --> 02:59:41,920
even go there. I'll tell a Helen Keller joke. Those are funny. How do Helen Keller's parents

2505
02:59:41,920 --> 02:59:51,920
punish her? How? By rearranging the furniture. It's funny because she's blind. That's not

2506
02:59:51,920 --> 02:59:58,520
really racist, but you know. I have a deaf joke. A deaf joke, okay. Of course I learned

2507
02:59:58,520 --> 03:00:04,880
this joke from a deaf person. Three people were, there was a big conference and a deaf

2508
03:00:04,880 --> 03:00:12,720
guy was sitting with an American guy and there was a Russian guy and a Mexican guy. No, I'm

2509
03:00:12,720 --> 03:00:17,620
not Mexican, a Cuban guy. And Cuban guy stands up and goes, walks over to a window. He takes

2510
03:00:17,620 --> 03:00:23,060
a puff of a cigar and throws it out the window. And the deaf guy signs to him, why did you

2511
03:00:23,060 --> 03:00:26,440
throw the cigar out the window? He's like, oh, that's pretty. Cigars in Cuba, hey, Cuban

2512
03:00:26,440 --> 03:00:32,000
cigars. So the deaf guy just sits back and goes along with watching the conference. And

2513
03:00:32,000 --> 03:00:35,760
And then the Russian guy gets up and takes a big swig of vodka and throws a bottle out

2514
03:00:35,760 --> 03:00:36,760
the window.

2515
03:00:36,760 --> 03:00:38,760
He's like, well, why'd you throw the vodka out the window?

2516
03:00:38,760 --> 03:00:42,280
Throw your vodka in Russia, you know, Russia, vodka.

2517
03:00:42,280 --> 03:00:44,960
So the deaf guy's sitting there, he's thinking.

2518
03:00:44,960 --> 03:00:48,520
Swig goes up and opens the window, picks up the American guy and throws him out the window.

2519
03:00:48,520 --> 03:00:50,160
He's like, where'd you do that?

2520
03:00:50,160 --> 03:00:54,400
Plenty of hearing people in America.

2521
03:00:54,400 --> 03:00:55,400
I have a gay joke.

2522
03:00:55,400 --> 03:00:59,660
How do you make a gay guy scream twice?

2523
03:00:59,660 --> 03:01:09,380
him in the ass and then wipe your cock on the curtains. Mabel would also like to know,

2524
03:01:09,380 --> 03:01:15,180
when you were talking about big boobs, were you making fun of me being fat? I don't know

2525
03:01:15,180 --> 03:01:23,940
how he gets fat out of that. Yes. Do your boobs produce milk? Do you drink a lot of

2526
03:01:23,940 --> 03:01:28,540
breast milk? You know they have lactation pads that you can put in your bra now. We

2527
03:01:28,540 --> 03:01:32,500
should get you some. Now that's making fun, see?

2528
03:01:32,500 --> 03:01:35,460
Why are people so, you know... Why are people self-conscious?

2529
03:01:35,460 --> 03:01:38,420
I don't know. It's like you have your own creamer. It's awesome.

2530
03:01:38,420 --> 03:01:45,500
Well, you know, I would be self-conscious if you... Okay. First of all, if you've never...

2531
03:01:45,500 --> 03:01:47,220
That's the other reason why I'm not having children.

2532
03:01:47,220 --> 03:01:49,620
Dude, I can't even... I can't even find you.

2533
03:01:49,620 --> 03:01:53,180
Uh, Mabel, it also... No, no, no. After sitting for 30 minutes listening to

2534
03:01:53,180 --> 03:01:57,580
my stepsister telling me about what it feels like to lactate, no children for me, thank

2535
03:01:57,580 --> 03:01:58,580
Thank you.

2536
03:01:58,580 --> 03:02:01,580
I'll come back to Mabel's last question a little bit.

2537
03:02:01,580 --> 03:02:04,820
Nince would like to say, not a question, but a comment.

2538
03:02:04,820 --> 03:02:10,220
If only God can prevent forest fires, well then they'll always start.

2539
03:02:10,220 --> 03:02:11,900
Thank you.

2540
03:02:11,900 --> 03:02:15,700
You the funny.

2541
03:02:15,700 --> 03:02:19,020
Rice Princess is asking when we're going to update the damn website because she doesn't

2542
03:02:19,020 --> 03:02:22,380
want to plug it if it's not updated.

2543
03:02:22,380 --> 03:02:31,060
We've made steps to get a new website constructed, but it's just coming along slowly.

2544
03:02:31,060 --> 03:02:32,820
We need to have it done soon though.

2545
03:02:32,820 --> 03:02:33,820
I know we do.

2546
03:02:33,820 --> 03:02:34,820
So hopefully this week.

2547
03:02:34,820 --> 03:02:35,820
Yes?

2548
03:02:35,820 --> 03:02:40,700
I feel like an alien is going to pop out of my stomach.

2549
03:02:40,700 --> 03:02:43,700
You'll be okay though, right?

2550
03:02:43,700 --> 03:02:47,600
See, I'm immune to the pork and grease.

2551
03:02:47,600 --> 03:02:52,140
John Field says, should Weird Al do a parody of a Linkin Park song?

2552
03:02:52,140 --> 03:02:53,140
Yes.

2553
03:02:53,140 --> 03:02:54,140
No.

2554
03:02:54,140 --> 03:02:55,140
Yeah, he has.

2555
03:02:55,140 --> 03:02:56,140
Has he?

2556
03:02:56,140 --> 03:02:57,140
What?

2557
03:02:57,140 --> 03:02:58,140
Angry wife boy polka.

2558
03:02:58,140 --> 03:02:59,140
Is Lincoln Park in there?

2559
03:02:59,140 --> 03:03:00,140
It might be.

2560
03:03:00,140 --> 03:03:01,140
Oh.

2561
03:03:01,140 --> 03:03:03,020
Gurr would like to know, why is it so hard to get rid of hiccups?

2562
03:03:03,020 --> 03:03:12,700
I don't know, why is it so hard to get rid of Mexicans?

2563
03:03:12,700 --> 03:03:16,340
Thank you for answering two questions and one there with Naples joke as well.

2564
03:03:16,340 --> 03:03:18,220
Thank you.

2565
03:03:18,220 --> 03:03:24,980
I just thought I'd like to address the other comment there. I don't know. I'm not really

2566
03:03:24,980 --> 03:03:35,100
racist. I just play one on the radio. Okay. Maple's last question. Why aren't you accepting

2567
03:03:35,100 --> 03:03:41,820
any more questions? Because, kids, it's the end of the show. And Ask Orange Lounge is

2568
03:03:41,820 --> 03:03:52,540
Is now over and done.

2569
03:03:52,540 --> 03:03:54,220
Let's not shoot a dead horse.

2570
03:03:54,220 --> 03:03:55,980
Let's get on to the next segment.

2571
03:03:55,980 --> 03:03:57,700
I'm going to peek from the pork.

2572
03:03:57,700 --> 03:03:59,860
The pork is really nasty.

2573
03:03:59,860 --> 03:04:01,500
Okay.

2574
03:04:01,500 --> 03:04:05,780
Um, final thoughts?

2575
03:04:05,780 --> 03:04:09,680
Thank God the pork is gone.

2576
03:04:09,680 --> 03:04:14,720
I'm not eating any more bacon for a while.

2577
03:04:14,720 --> 03:04:21,920
My final thought is I hate Walmart, no I'm not going to get over it.

2578
03:04:21,920 --> 03:04:24,880
Now I remember why I gave up pork.

2579
03:04:24,880 --> 03:04:30,920
I'm also very sad because I just spent $340 in arcade buttons.

2580
03:04:30,920 --> 03:04:33,040
That is sad.

2581
03:04:33,040 --> 03:04:34,040
Final word of the show.

2582
03:04:34,040 --> 03:04:39,040
I had to take it myself. I'll give it to Jamie. I know she always likes to have the final word. Here it is.

2583
03:04:42,040 --> 03:04:47,040
The final word of the evening is puce.

2584
03:04:48,040 --> 03:04:57,040
You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio. Orange Lounge Radio is hosted by Dark Sakura, Skye, and Loki. We expect you a nice play again.

2585
03:04:57,040 --> 03:05:04,040

2586
03:05:27,040 --> 03:05:31,040

Should I stop? Hey, I don't know

2595
03:06:09,040 --> 03:06:12,040
Turn the light and I'll blow

2596
03:06:12,040 --> 03:06:15,040
To the extreme, I rock a mic like a vandal

2597
03:06:15,040 --> 03:06:18,040
Light up the stage and watch me jump like a candle

2598
03:06:18,040 --> 03:06:21,040

2601
03:06:39,040 --> 03:06:55,680
Thanks for listening and we'll see you next week.

2602
03:07:09,040 --> 03:07:34,040
I

2603
03:07:34,040 --> 03:07:58,040
I want to talk about the Trivial Pursuit game that we played Monday night.

2604
03:07:58,040 --> 03:08:00,040
Was it this Monday?

2605
03:08:00,040 --> 03:08:06,740
Yes. Monday was so funny. We played Trivial Pursuit. We brought...okay. It was after Vanilla

2606
03:08:06,740 --> 03:08:10,480
Sky we decided to go out and get a board game. So we went to Walmart. This was pre-Evil.

2607
03:08:10,480 --> 03:08:15,080
We went to Walmart and bought Trivial Pursuit, the 20th anniversary edition, and brought

2608
03:08:15,080 --> 03:08:19,900
it home and played. It was me, Brad, Irene, Loki, and Nellie, Loki's girlfriend. We were

2609
03:08:19,900 --> 03:08:24,220
all playing. And hilarity. It was absolutely hilarious. We got some of the most funniest

2610
03:08:24,220 --> 03:08:27,780
answers ever. Like, I was asking Nellie a question. I was trying to get everybody's

2611
03:08:27,780 --> 03:08:31,580
attention because everybody was talking. I wanted to ask a question, so I went, which?

2612
03:08:31,580 --> 03:08:36,660
And I was like, which? I was starting the question, which one of the, and Irene's all,

2613
03:08:36,660 --> 03:08:41,420
don't call her a witch. It was funny, had to be there. And then we learned that there

2614
03:08:41,420 --> 03:08:48,220
is a cat exhibit at the local aquarium. And we also learned that Stephen King directed

2615
03:08:48,220 --> 03:08:56,900
E.T. I'm going to get punched in the face for that one, but that's okay. I got to fuck

2616
03:08:56,900 --> 03:09:05,580
you Rob I gotta fuck you I'm sorry what what Jamie Jamie has clean clothes she's

2617
03:09:05,580 --> 03:09:08,860
celebrating I can smell clean clothes because the fans blowing the clean

2618
03:09:08,860 --> 03:09:18,620
clothes smell this way mmm smells like clean clothes miss thank you all for

2619
03:09:18,620 --> 03:09:21,620
listening to and supporting orange launch radio we do appreciate it it's

2620
03:09:21,620 --> 03:09:27,140
That's very nice of you.

2621
03:09:27,140 --> 03:09:29,060
I think we're pretty much done.

2622
03:09:29,060 --> 03:09:32,340
Jamie, do you have anything you want to say?

2623
03:09:32,340 --> 03:09:33,380
Get your ass over here.

2624
03:09:37,380 --> 03:09:40,260
Who needs potpourri when you can have clean laundry?

2625
03:09:43,180 --> 03:09:44,140
What a lovely thought.

2626
03:09:44,140 --> 03:09:53,380
What do you mean you sprinkled detergent all over the house?

2627
03:09:53,380 --> 03:10:04,380
No, you want to know get away the clean clothes, or not really clean clothes, but give the

2628
03:10:04,380 --> 03:10:07,380
impression of clean clothes, rub a dryer sheet on yourself.

2629
03:10:07,380 --> 03:10:11,540
That's so ghetto. That's like something you'd hear on.

2630
03:10:11,540 --> 03:10:12,540
What?

2631
03:10:12,540 --> 03:10:13,540
of the union.

2632
03:10:13,540 --> 03:10:14,540
Do you smell my butt?

2633
03:10:14,540 --> 03:10:15,540
Rob just smelled my butt.

2634
03:10:15,540 --> 03:10:16,540
I smelled your butt.

2635
03:10:16,540 --> 03:10:17,540
It smells April fresh.

2636
03:10:17,540 --> 03:10:18,540
That was beautiful.

2637
03:10:18,540 --> 03:10:35,860
Okay, sex, blood, and violence, and bloodshed.

2638
03:10:35,860 --> 03:10:42,100
Well there's this movie, Ichi the Killer, where this guy beats up this prostitute and

2639
03:10:42,100 --> 03:10:46,540
and they cut off her nipples, as I mentioned earlier, and there's lots of blood from that.

2640
03:10:46,540 --> 03:10:52,140
So that has sex, you know, violence and blood. What a lovely thought, thank you. It's a great

2641
03:10:52,140 --> 03:10:59,180
movie, though. No, the other thing with the same prostitute, or different prostitute,

2642
03:10:59,180 --> 03:11:10,100
actually, gets her leg cut off and she's hobbling on one foot. Yeah, it's funny. Yeah, funny.

2643
03:11:10,100 --> 03:11:15,860
Okay. I think we're done. I'll be nicer when you're smarter.

2644
03:11:15,860 --> 03:11:19,180
Good night everybody. Thank you for supporting Orange Lounge Radio. We appreciate it. After

2645
03:11:19,180 --> 03:11:24,820
the show tonight, we have for you guys a dance mania marathon. Yay. Whole bunch of thrown

2646
03:11:24,820 --> 03:11:29,020
together tracks from your favorite dance mania albums. That should be exciting. There's whole

2647
03:11:29,020 --> 03:11:34,220
bunches of albums in here. I'm sure you guys will enjoy it. Oh, I have to add one more.

2648
03:11:34,220 --> 03:11:39,100
I want to make sure EX4 gets in here too. So, Loki, say something else while I get this

2649
03:11:39,100 --> 03:11:44,100
If you give me money, I will invite you over to play in the arcade cabinet, because it will be sweet.

2650
03:11:44,100 --> 03:11:48,100
But no one has given me money except for Vandalous.

2651
03:11:48,100 --> 03:11:51,100
And Vandalous, you're more than welcome to come over when I'm done.

2652
03:11:51,100 --> 03:11:55,100
Yeah, but he gave me ten dollars.

2653
03:11:55,100 --> 03:12:02,100
That's alright. Well, you're more than welcome to come over, you're always...

2654
03:12:02,100 --> 03:12:04,100
Whoo! Court! Ah!

2655
03:12:04,100 --> 03:12:06,100
Change.

2656
03:12:06,100 --> 03:12:10,100
Yeah, but she just did laundry here, so that's more like a laundromat.

2657
03:12:10,100 --> 03:12:13,100
Oh yeah. Yeah.

2658
03:12:13,100 --> 03:12:21,100
I'm going to use it as a piggy bank also. It's a $60 piggy bank. Stupid fucking coin door costs that much.

2659
03:12:21,100 --> 03:12:28,100
But, um, yeah, it will be sweet. And I'm thinking because, you know, it'll be nice and tall,

2660
03:12:28,100 --> 03:12:32,100
and I want to put it where this chair is that Jamie sits all the time in.

2661
03:12:32,100 --> 03:12:36,260
I want to put it right there because it'd be out of the way, but then we'd need to move

2662
03:12:36,260 --> 03:12:40,780
the chair, get rid of the chair, and then she'd have to come in the view of the webcam.

2663
03:12:40,780 --> 03:12:46,860
Okay, we're going to do a Dance Mania marathon now. If you missed any portion of tonight's

2664
03:12:46,860 --> 03:12:51,820
show, you can always tune into the rewinds, which are on Wednesdays at 4 o'clock and Thursdays

2666
03:12:56,060 --> 03:13:00,300

2667
03:13:00,300 --> 03:13:05,460
fart continuously on the mic on Wednesday night Wednesday might just be

2668
03:13:05,460 --> 03:13:09,980
a lie if we can't get zero to commit to a show we might just do a live trivial

2669
03:13:09,980 --> 03:13:16,380
pursuit game on air I know we should call the show what I set myself on fire

2670
03:13:16,380 --> 03:13:19,900

Come on, baby, take hold of me

2673
03:13:52,900 --> 03:13:55,900
Hold of me, hold of me

2674
03:14:04,900 --> 03:14:07,900
Come on, baby, take hold of me

2675
03:14:07,900 --> 03:14:10,900
Fulfill my dreams and set me free

2676
03:14:10,900 --> 03:14:13,900
I know that you and I know you believe

2677
03:14:13,900 --> 03:14:17,900
Your touch supplies my energy

2678
03:14:17,900 --> 03:14:20,900
Come on, baby, take hold of me

2679
03:14:20,900 --> 03:14:23,900

I feel the dream, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

2684
03:14:43,900 --> 03:14:50,900
It's a matter of facts and it's plain to see The love that turns inside of me

2685
03:14:50,900 --> 03:14:56,900
I'd like to lead you back deep by my side

2686
03:14:56,900 --> 03:15:03,900
These memories might never end But a broken dream will come to pass

2687
03:15:03,900 --> 03:15:10,900
And a passion that is lost within my mind

2688
03:15:10,900 --> 03:15:14,300
Come on baby, take hold of me

2689
03:15:14,300 --> 03:15:17,740
Just fill my dreams and set me free

2690
03:15:17,740 --> 03:15:20,880
To know the truth, and I know you'd believe

2691
03:15:20,880 --> 03:15:24,500
It's such a play if I dream

2692
03:15:24,520 --> 03:15:27,520
Come on baby, take hold of me

2693

To know the truth, and I know you believe

2695
03:15:33,960 --> 03:15:37,560
It's such a play if I dream

2696
03:15:37,560 --> 03:15:40,560
Now you're here in my field of dreams

2697
03:15:43,560 --> 03:15:46,560
The love has passed me by its wings

2698
03:15:47,560 --> 03:15:53,560

Do you wanna taste it?

2716
03:22:01,140 --> 03:22:03,140
Do you wanna touch it?

2717
03:22:04,140 --> 03:22:06,140
Do you wanna lick it?

2718
03:22:06,140 --> 03:22:13,200

Ah, ah, ah, ah

2722
03:23:29,020 --> 03:23:44,020
In the summertime, in the summertime, I'll be fine every night.

2723
03:23:44,020 --> 03:23:47,020
Everybody is mine, but we only get proud.

2724
03:23:47,020 --> 03:23:50,020
When the sun will shine, and they'll be pretty nice.

2725
03:23:50,020 --> 03:23:54,020
Makes me feel so fine, with the readings of light.

2726
03:23:54,020 --> 03:23:57,020
The moon in the shadows, the sun in the stars.

2727
03:23:57,020 --> 03:24:00,520
Everybody gets ready for all of your crimes

2728
03:24:00,520 --> 03:24:03,520
No, never, baby, my time

2729
03:24:03,520 --> 03:24:05,520
There's nothing to do this freedom

2730
03:24:05,520 --> 03:24:07,520
And heaven can die

2731
03:24:07,520 --> 03:24:09,520
Come in, Mr. DJ!

2732
03:25:07,520 --> 03:25:31,920
Come in, Mr. DJ!

In the summertime, fight and fight every night

2734
03:25:58,920 --> 03:26:06,920
Everybody is fine, it's the only big cloud When the sun will shine, and it'll be through the night

2735
03:26:06,920 --> 03:26:13,920
Makes me feel so fine, it's the rhythm of life In the moonlight shadows, the sun is bright

2736
03:26:13,920 --> 03:26:19,920
Everybody gets ready for only big clouds No, never, baby, it's the final time

2737
03:26:19,920 --> 03:26:23,920

Give me your shit!

2744
03:30:53,760 --> 03:30:56,760
Let's go!

2745
03:31:08,760 --> 03:31:11,760
It's got to be your love

2746
03:31:11,760 --> 03:31:14,760
The only love I want

2747
03:31:14,760 --> 03:31:15,760
You know

2748
03:31:15,760 --> 03:31:19,760
You are the agent of my life

2749
03:31:19,760 --> 03:31:28,760
It's got to be my heart, being beside you all night long at all

2750
03:31:28,760 --> 03:31:33,760
I wanna get closer to you, my love

2751

Until the day I die, I'll be your everything

2752

And oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
