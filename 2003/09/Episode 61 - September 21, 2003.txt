Toto? I have a feeling we're not in Kansas anymore.
You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio, the Monty Talk and then some.
Uh, mostly the and then some part of that.
Orange Lounge Radio is created by a bunch of potty-mouthed adults.
Orange Lounge may contain sexual, perverted, and mildly retarded content.
You probably shouldn't let your children listen to Orange Lounge Radio.
Yes, I will spank your child.
If you're not going to do your job, goddammit, I will.
Well, here's to my big opening.
A sphincter says why?
I'm super. Thanks for asking.
You little bitch troll from hell!
What am I doing here?
Haha!
Nooo!
Eh?
Dodge this.
Mm-hmm.
This is a tasty burger.
Look, you stupid bastard!
You've got no arms left!
Yes, I have!
Look!
There's a flesh wound.
Searching for a boy in high school is that useless.
It's searching for meaning in a polyshore.
Oh, yeah?
Well...
I hope your babies look like monkeys.
Dark Sakura.
I had a sniff, but I'm playing it for the bartender, so suffer.
Loki, I hate you.
Orange Lounge Radio.
We are live, finally.
And this is episode number 61.
Well, at least a fraction of it.
The first 20 minutes is gone forever, but that's okay, we didn't do them.
For September the 21st of 2003, you're tuned in to Bamani Scene's most comcast-hating radio station of all things B-Mani.
My name is Rob Roberts, but you might know me as Sky. Joining me, as always, are my awesome co-hosts.
In this corner, the happiest bunny on the farm is Jamie Summers. You know her better as Stark Sakura.
There's nothing on my face.
She's too busy playing dance summit right now.
Well, you know, we have other things going on like the show that's more important.
The game will have to come later.
uh... in that corner
it's mother say hello to protect that's a low-key
you can't play play that they had been able to do something without a show
why does knowing indoors
uh... so i don't know i just knowing that battle for god i thought you were
talking about real life i was like what the hell is stealing
yes robert still outside that you know special one hundred degrees
We know! Turn it off!
No, you didn't want to talk when you had the mic, so nah!
Bitch.
I like Dance Summit. Okay, next.
Alright. We're not going to take an opening break tonight, we're just going to go right into the show.
Yeah, you had a twenty minute opening break before the show, so deal.
So, hello, and welcome to Orange Lounge Radio episode number 61.
We're going to get right into it.
If you want to join our chat room, www.calibomani.com, click on Orange Lounge and click on chat.
If we're a little dazed, you'll just have to forgive us, it's taking us a minute to
kind of get back in the groove here, trying to do the show.
Hey, get in the groove, I made a DDR game.
No.
Do you want to...
Ow!
Okay.
Get out the whip, babe.
All right, if you want to visit our webcam,
because we have a lot of guests in the studio tonight,
go to our chat room and they'll tell you
how to get to the webcam, because we're not
giving out the URL here.
Because that's incentive to go to the chat.
OK, let's go around and say who's here tonight,
because we have a lot of guests here.
So you know Dark, Sackler, and Loki, of course, by now.
We also have.
Say hello.
It's Puppy over here.
Cat Puppy is in the house.
Yes, after.
Be careful with that.
you break something also with us tonight say hello to this is somebody who's new
never been to the show say hello to pilot hyper girl hello how are you she
brought her whip and everything so she's going to oh hello not in the house not
in the house dear unless it's in the bedroom well you're 18 now huh when's
your first movie coming out I'm just kidding it's not gonna happen with me
We went with Randy, Yellow Jacket Boy, also known as DJ Taka on the boards, or Taka Shonen
as you guys might know him on Cali Bumani.
We also went with Aori, we went with BJ, and we went with Psycho Joe.
Apparently clubbing is a place where everyone is either drunk or high.
No, when I go. Well, drunk maybe.
Incredibly high.
I get drunk a lot. I don't get high. I don't do that. I don't endorse Swede.
Now, drunk on the other hand is a different story.
Yeah, drunk on the other hand is a completely different story.
Okay, I'm noticing we're still having some connection stability issues.
Like, our chat room is running fine, but the station seems to be having...
Still, we don't have issues.
Having a problem. Yeah, what is this show if we don't have issues?
We're just going to keep going here, and you'll have to bear with us.
You can address those cards and love letters to Comcast Cable, because that's where our
problem lies right now.
If you guys haven't heard already, because I heard this hit National News, California,
Oregon, and Washington all had an outage on Comcast, so we all went down for about ten
minutes, but for some reason, some areas went down for an hour, and we were one of those
lucky areas.
So anyway, bear with us.
those lucky areas. So anyway, bear with us. The show will be played back in its entirety
on Wednesday and Thursday, of course. The webcam is also being switched over to a one
minute refresh because of the traffic on the net right now because of this Comcast outage.
So I'm switching it over to one minute refresh. I think the buffer, introduce yourself one
more time, dear, because I think the buffer hit right when you were introducing yourself.
Hello! It's VHG. Yeah, okay.
Hi!
Alright.
I was sitting here going, I'm a burp.
Do you need to let out a burp, Jamie? Just let it out. Let it out, girl.
I'm going to exorcise the burp.
My burp is stuck in my esophagus.
Yeah, pat her on the back like a baby.
There it is! It worked!
You're like a gassy baby right now.
I knew you were full of hot gas, but- I cannot put that in my hair.
Aha.
Oh.
No.
B.H.G. do not give her the whip.
That's bad.
She doesn't need the whip.
We still have more people to introduce.
We have a guy here from halfway across America we haven't even said hello to yet, so let's
get over here.
Well, let's go around the couch here.
Say hello.
Hello.
Hello.
Hi Joey, how are you?
I'm good, thank you.
You're back!
I'm back.
Joey played his very first game of DDR today.
I did.
This is exciting that one year into Orange Lounge Radio we can still find DDR noobs and
kind of like follow them along as they're getting into DDR.
It's so cute.
Oh, that was the ferret launcher.
Dude, Matt built a ferret launcher.
That's awesome.
You missed it.
Oh, he booked you?
It wasn't that good anyway.
You missed it.
Oh, you broke the...
It wasn't that good anyway.
The burp of all burps.
Ferret, ferret.
I need the ferret.
Okay.
I need one.
Let's see who else is here.
There he is.
Yeah, baby.
Pass it on.
And here we go.
All the way from Kansas is Shane.
Hi, Shane.
Hi, Rob.
How are you?
I'm fine.
I'm fine.
I'm fine.
I'm fine.
I'm fine.
I'm fine.
I'm fine.
I'm fine.
I'm fine.
I'm fine.
I'm fine.
I'm fine.
Hi, how are you?
Good.
And what's your name online for people that might know you?
Shane.
Oh, nobody knows me online.
I know you.
I know you online.
Oh, then it'd be Zex and Shad.
Didn't you say you posted on some Kansas City boards
or something?
Yeah.
But you posted Shane?
No, I posted Mikletas.
Oh, OK.
Well, hello and welcome to California.
Thank you.
What brings you to California this week?
Family business and to get away from school.
Right on.
Good deal.
And what do you think so far of California, we're a little crazy here, huh?
Just a little, the ferrets flying, and the burping.
And it's nice to find Dance Summit, like, people that like it.
Dance Summit was pretty cool, I've got to admit, that's what we were kind of filling
in our downtime with, so that was fun.
So a big hello to you, thank you for being here.
Thank you.
This is neat because just like, what, two weeks ago we had John Fields here all the
all the way from like way back east, Connecticut, New York, all the way from Connecticut and
now here we have another fan all the way from Kansas, so this is cool, I like this, and
of course in the corner where the freshman belongs is, where's my fucking joke book Rob?
The problem with your joke book is it's only about two pages long.
I think I have it.
I'm just kidding.
Oh, he did not just go there.
No, no.
Rob, Rob, it's more than two pages long.
It's five pages long in 40-point font.
Ouch.
I knew there was a reason you always hear from witty commentary.
All right.
So, whew, okay, everybody calm down for a minute.
Whew.
chaos in the beginning of the show here. I thought we'd kick off the show like we usually
do, our all favorite game. How was your week and how was your day? I want to play this
because of course we have some out of town folks here that probably have a lot that I
want to say about California. And I certainly have a lot to say. So let's, I actually have
the money related stories to tell this week too. No way, way. So we're going to start
with Jamie. Hi. Wait, wait, hold on, hold on. I got this. Bradley gets a total zing.
Arkadian42 in the chat room, he says, and 23 Magus's joke book, it's printed on recycled
paper just like the material. I hate you. That was beautiful. I thought that it was
recycled like, you know, like recycled toilet paper. It's written on five sheets of toilet
paper. Anyway, Jamie, how was your day? How was your week? My week sucked. I worked and
Dan was off in Texas.
He manages an unnamed video game store.
And this unnamed series of video game stores
had a conference in an unnamed state named Texas.
It's named now.
You killed the ferret!
Ferret rescued you.
I killed the ferret.
The ferret's supposed to be.
OK.
Give me the ferret.
give me my baby
I don't want this baby
I don't want it now
ok anyway
anyway
so I've been really
like by myself all week
and it sucked
and I played some
play some fantasy star
I played some
yeah my new
addiction sort of is fantasy star online
online. Which I'm playing on the Xbox. Because I gave up playing it on the GameCube.
In response to Naoki in the chat room, yes, you must get the Skaia. Yes, you will. And
it's... Oh, Jamie... Okay, what are we looking at inside? What are we looking at inside?
I don't think I wonder what's in that jug. They're growing a mutant in this bottle of
orange juice
it expired in july and i got it in the fridge today
yuck
might i add i was about to pour myself a glass
but penicillin is good for you, it's an anti-biotic
yeah right
it's rare form
let me shift my position here
i'm still hiding from the webcam
Anyway, what is that?
Anyway, all right.
Richie, they do not look like maids.
Get over it, please.
Anyway, the Capra's look stupid now, by the way.
But anyway, so I played like a whole bunch of Red Rock online
and they implemented the Komodo patch,
which I made it there walking with my assassin.
Anyway, with the, you know,
judicious use of fly wings to teleport.
And I, and then I found out that with all the free wharfs it only cost me
like 2,000 zenny to get there with my, to get there with my merchant.
So I took my merchant there, bought 60,000 steel arrows and doubled all of my money, like,
and then I started a guild named Battle Royale
on my archer
anyway, so yeah, my week's been like full of gaming and then full of some
really stupid crappy stress
and I haven't touched a single bimani game all weekend
all week
you know what, the past four weeks we've done this segment you haven't touched a bimani game
I am next week. Max 2 is coming out this week, do you plan on playing it? I'm gonna play it
I've still got the interestingly acquired
dance pad at my house.
You mean my dance pad?
It's been at my house for 30 days.
Hey, watch it, lady.
I don't like where you're going with that.
I'm kidding.
It's not paying rent either, so evict it already.
I'm kidding.
You know I give it back when you ask for it.
Provided we don't break up, because that's
I got it in the first place and and then I found out that I'm 69% male on my
lateral which is funny excuse me but I have balls to scratch thank you for
of those in your magazine said, I thought
they were on the upper body.
Flying ferret.
This thing hurts, by the way, when you hit people with it.
My, my, I found out that this thing
that I have my hair wrapped up in hurts really hard
if you get wrapped with it.
What about the whip?
Whips hurt too, but this hurts more.
Oh, OK.
Anyway, I downloaded a bunch of crap from my computer, and she's also the most wonderful
sister in the world because she's working on dark sakura.com and by the way we did some
work for roleplay.dark sakura.com which should be a few more forms have been added on so
everybody has to sign up for it now and then that's it so that was your day in your week
and came home today and you might be leaving early tonight maybe because it might you might
have to you know plan for a long evening home tonight and we're gonna go get food
but I ate I had a salad and blue potato chips which I'm going to share with
everyone yum blue did it taste like blue it tastes like blue amazingly enough
awesome it tastes very rugged like blue just a reminder you guys I'm the chat
room is kind of bitching about things going up and down we're doing the best
we can address those cards and letters to Comcast, DDRcaholic in the chat room says
Comcast is so friggin' unreliable, it should be illegal to run a business the way they
do and I tend to agree, it's pretty sad.
It's even worse than Scandia's business.
It's worse than Roseville Golf Land.
And getting down to Scandia's.
It's a moment of silence like, I can't believe you just went there.
Hey, I worked at Arcades, I know what's going on.
How was your week, how was your day?
This week was expensive, it involved buying things.
There's a lot of wood outside.
Loki bought some stiff wood.
Yes, I bought eight nice sheets of MDF for the arcade cabinet.
I'm working on finishing my pads. I'm almost done.
I've got one of them almost done.
I'm starting the wiring on it, but I haven't gotten around to it.
But anyway, starting the wiring on one of the pads,
the other pad needs to be done, probably be done this week.
Arcade stuff, I'm getting the rest of my buttons pretty soon.
I ordered an Atari 2600 track ball
that's going to be hacked into turntables for 2DX.
So you're turning an Atari 2600 track ball
into a 2DX controller?
No, the optical controls for it are
going to be for the turntables for 2DX.
But then, I have these two spinners here, I realize they're pretty useless now.
Yeah. Because I can't use them, duh.
It's because it's a B movie.
But anyways, so I bought a bunch of shit, and I spent a lot of money,
and now I have to scrimp for like a few weeks.
And then, what else did I do?
I can't even see the screen. It's for the best, Loki, don't worry about it. It's for
the best. Our chat room, our chat room is bitchy tonight. Man, you take, you rob them
of 20 minutes of orange lounge and just go freaking claws out. I think Loki's kicking
someone from the chat room. And of course she's under my name. Hey, be nice! That was
under me! You did that under my name! Rob, that's so mean! Why did you do that? I didn't
do it, and Jamie knows it, and she's my witness. I did not do it! I didn't do it! Rob! I said
I'm sorry I'm gonna kick him where's my foot that's pretty bad if you smell the
shoe mine smells worse okay so what else did I do this week
Will somebody, will somebody invite her back, please?
Anyway, go ahead.
Yeah. So, what else?
I don't know, I didn't do too much this week.
It's pretty much just working on the stupid pads and then, you know,
just sitting at my desk, rotting away.
And at one point I was trying to, I didn't know how I was going to hook up the pads to, like, the.
I know I'm hilarious okay if you're not in our chat room tonight you're missing
out I'm sorry I'm sorry that was so one-sided the chat room is so bitchy
she tonight, it's beautiful. You must be there. www.callybemani.com. Click on Orange
Lounge and click on chat. Yeah, anyways, so... Moving on. Yes. Yeah, that's pretty much my
week yeah just a lot of nothing oh and I found a lot of rotted stuff in our
fridge which I cleaned out not that huh yeah hmm that's it I'm done all right
but then again you know if Marin wants me to I can keep talking all night long I can
never said. I'll talk about my week and my day. My week was, there wasn't really a lot
to it, work, sleep, play, you know, type thing, whatever. There was that and then, but this
weekend, this was cool. Yesterday, yesterday I went to Reno. Well, Reno is kind of a shit
hole in some ways but, you know, I got to gamble which is fun because I love gambling.
I lost $100 yesterday gambling, which is kind of sad in a way, but I had lost $120, and
I made $20 back on video poker, so that's good, but I lost $60 in a slot machine trying
to win a Lexus.
I really, really wanted it.
That was real wise.
And not only do we gamble, we went around and played some different DDR machines, because
you know, in a town like Vegas or Reno, every casino's got a DDR machine, right?
So we went to the El Dorado, and they have, get this, a Solo 4th Plus.
Those are so rare.
It was godly.
I was so happy to play it.
I mean, like, how often do you see a 4th Plus these days, let alone a Solo 4th Plus I could
play?
And you know, you know, I fired that fucker up and I played Solo Conga Feelin', first
6 panel conga feelin. It's awesome.
And I did some freestyle too. That was fun. I went with the Ice Princess.
I did some lead freestyle too.
Aaron too just perked up when you said that.
I did some great freestyle. I did a freestyle to the 7th jump.
I did a freestyle to the 7th jump. It ruled.
You don't know the 7th.
I feel the need to spread my sky germs everywhere.
Oh, heaven forbid.
So, anyway.
I humped that machine.
That was pretty much my week of my day in a nutshell.
Yeah, I am.
So, if EvilMalkey2DX says he humped that machine.
So, I humped it too.
So, we kind of had sex.
I hope you wore a condom.
Oh, boy.
I did, I danced to Oh Nick, please don't so quick too,
because to play six panel erotic is just beautiful.
Moving on.
What was that number two in your five toilet paper sheet joke book?
Puppy. How was your day, how was your week?
Okay, this week has been stuff on campus, looking for a job, and just got,
kostjamrh And more Disgaea, and more Disgaea, and more Disgaea.
Q. Did you do the past week's prize Disgaea?
A. No, I really don't remember anything I did the past week besides play Disgaea.
That's kinda sad, but it's time well spent.
Q. You took a picture of my ass in the screenshot.
A. That's a really good picture.
And then there's that fuck out column on the microphone.
A game has to be good when you hear some really disturbing jokes about a zombie and a horse
wiener.
Is this something out of Magus's joke book?
What?
No.
Oh.
No, I'm serious.
It's actually part of the plot of the game.
Why is my ass still on the webcam?
Your ass is still on the webcam because it hasn't refreshed you.
checking you out

alright that was it
alright uh Joey do you have anything you want to share about your week and your day
p0k3smot42o my week was filled with work, and work, and more work, but it pays the bills.
This weekend I was off, didn't do a whole lot, just hung out, and today I played my
first game of DDR, very first time, and what was it? I passed a three-step.
Yes, you passed a three-footer. That's the DDR lingo, a three-footer.
I passed it. That was so cool. First try. Anyway, other than that, that was it.
it
uh... was it
look into the sky?
Good job!
Chaos, this isn't Channel DDR Freak, mom jokes are not welcome here!
Anyway, our chair room is so feisty tonight. What a bunch of bitches.
Anyway, let's move on. Andrew, Mr. Magus, tell us about your week and your day.
My week was full of bombing Japanese quizzes and putting it on locks at the ARC arcade.
I've been studying, Jamie, and I've been working with a student association at ARC, trying
to get some machines worked on.
They're checking out the Beachhead 2000, trying to get there a place for something Bahmani.
I can concur with that, actually.
And now, if you noticed, I saved our two guests for last, and one's on the phone right now.
He must be on a booty call, so we'll talk to Aaron.
Never mind, this is Dad.
What was that joke he told at dinner, something about we were making fun of him for being
on the phone with his uncle, or something, we joked about it being a booty call, and
He said, no, it's my uncle, and he's not even cute.
It's great.
Shane's a riot.
We'll hear from him in a little bit.
Let's hear from Erin, Biden hyper girl.
How was your week and how was your day?
Well, my week was full of planning for a friend,
planning a birthday party for a friend, a surprise birthday
party, which, by the way, when we surprised her,
I've never seen her turn more red until that day.
And she started crying, too.
So it was a really good party, and I slept over.
So I am running on about three hours of sleep, a sip of DNL,
some water, some orange juice, huh?
Don't forget the penguin mints.
Yeah, the penguin mints.
And I don't know what else I'm running on.
Hi, and welcome to college.
Yeah, I feel vaguely hungry right now,
but it hasn't hit me yet.
I'm hungry.
Give me the blue cheese.
Let's get the blue cheese.
No!
But yeah.

Whoa, whoa, whoa.
This is a side of Logie I've never seen before.
orgy I've never seen him just propose a mass orgy like this sorry anyway let's
talk to Shane I'm not sure you was proposing I think he was just agreeing

One thousand six hundred and ninety miles from Kansas to get here.
You counted.

that was awesome
I burnt my tongue and it still hurts, but it was good.
We took them to one of the Mongolians that isn't even like one of the really good ones
we always go to.
We took them to that one we used to go to by my old house.
It's just called the Mongolian barbecue behind Wasabi.
It's okay, but it's not even the best one.
Well, you can't have Mongolian barbecue now, they're all closed.
I never had Korean barbeque.
So what else are you going to do on your trip?
I just got my San Francisco trip cancelled, which is fine.
What?
Dad doesn't want to drive anymore, so that's okay.
You get to hang with us more!
Oh no.
You can come over for vanilla sky tomorrow night.

a just an hour and a half I'm sorry three hours of lots of crap that I
decided to play but in a chat room you can request something and if I have it
I'll play it and if it sucks I'll laugh at you and then I talk about killing
people often okay oh hi there's a mic right here um what do I talk about my
show um first of all Rob I don't have much of a reason to because my internet
was only out for five minutes and I wasn't even there when it happened the
only thing that obsessed me about that is I was vending at the time and you're
Yeah, so now your your vending is gone and your pre-show got pretty much axed unfortunately, but now you don't have to do
I
Was gonna say oh my show Aaron asked what I talked about on my show I talked about
We talked about like news stories sometimes and then we sometimes get into like other games like we talked about puzzle pirates a little bit
Talk about Ragnarok we talked about console games. I
saw
So now you even have more reason to join dark secularist forums
and
Just general crap. We have a little bit. So we do every week. We do a video video game trivia to bad music and we do
Guess the yahoo talkback because people on Yahoo are idiots
So tune in and see for yourself. Sorry. I just want to answer the question anything else you wanna say about your show Jamie on Tuesdays
I'm going to try to do video game music trivia, like actually where you play music and people guess, for an hour on my show.
So let's see if anyone can dethrone Darktitsia so that...
Huh? They can't hear what you're saying.
Can he do it in the last hour of the show so he can do it?
I'll see you when I'll start it. You just gotta be there.
Yeah.
All right.
Next.
Hold on.
Actually, I was just going to say Wednesday night to go chronologically.
This Wednesday is going to be our DDR Max 2 show, and we're just going to...
We're still not sure if Max 2 is actually going to hit Tuesday or Wednesday.
Some of you guys might get it Tuesday, but we're not going to bank on it, and Jamie has her show anyway,
so we're just going to hold off on Wednesday for sure.
We will have Max 2.
unless we don't get it wednesday either well then we're going to burn down the place you
pre-ordered it from which is a game stop but it's not the game stop it's a game stop
so um so it's okay if we burn it um but uh wednesday we'll be playing max 2 live on air
so for those of you that can't get it right now because of money issues or whatever you
can play it vicariously through us that's the whole idea and don't worry you'll lose
interest just as fast as we will. Yes, and then you won't even want to buy it. But with
DDR Max we actually did this and it was somewhat more successful than we thought. I just, I
remember when I got Max I went live with it. A lot of you really liked tuning in and listening
to it, so I had the webcam going and everything, so tune in for that this Wednesday. And then
next Wednesday, if it works out, what? Well, I was going to say that the first time we
did that with Max, you kind of didn't have it very well set up. Yeah, it was kind of
a shitty set up, but it's going to be much, you can already tell it's going to be much
much better this time because we have Loki's toys. Next Wednesday, it's not, the T's aren't
crossed and the I's aren't dotted, but we're hoping that we're going to be teaming up with
another website to bring you some exclusive programming. That's all I can say. Some very
interesting debut programming next Wednesday, just a one-off show.
I don't care about, but whatever.
I go, whoo!
Don't sound too excited. It's going to be big though. For a lot of you, you guys are
going to be all woke. Yeah, you freaking losers. Anyway, Loki. I haven't been there like in
a long time. Why are you giving this to me? Here. What are you doing? You freaking nut.
I was supposed to talk about my show. My show is called Mass Bondage Orgy. It's every Thursday
we have a mass bondage orgy in the middle of the room. We kind of move the table over
cuz it you know it's kind of in the way but I bet that pretty much explains the
stains on the ground but um yeah so mass bonded Georgie every Thursday at 7
o'clock are you seriously changing the name I bet more people would tune in you
know pretty funny Loki Loki's been having I feel bad because like people
tune in to listen to my train wreck of a show and Jamie gets Jamie gets some
pretty good listenership on her show, but for some reason you guys are not tuning in
on Thursdays. Hey, guess what you guys? Friends sucks. Don't watch Friends. Listen to Loki's
show.
Well, if you know, the same amount of people keep tuning in constantly, I guess I'm going
to have to stop doing my show and take a day off, you know?
What?
What?
Do we need to borrow a TV? We have an extra.
We'll see what we can do. We'll see what we can do.
I'm going to sell mine for cheap.
I have a nice 19-inch TV, pretty much like new.
I just upgraded to a 25.
Anyway, this is why no one tunes in Loki.
Talk about Livewire.
Livewire, it's my mixing show.
It's been going on for like seven weeks now except for one
week where I didn't do it because it was my birthday.
And then, yeah, so we did last week was
Bamani remixed music.
And we play a lot of like erotic trance stuff and then a
a lot of just remix stuff, like from 2DX and DDR and that kind of crap. And then, you know,
you guys were, you know, treated to a very nice set, you know, all four of you that turned,
tuned in. And actually, you know what, it was a good set of music. It was some good
stuff. And you had some stuff in there we never heard before, like you had the long
version of that Drifting Away mix. That was cool. Yeah. Pretty much, yeah, my show I give
it's a it's a sweet time
yeah
i know
you have like a shot of flash version of gal panic
that only is up during the show
if you're tuned in
well
uh... no
there you go
marin says the best damn remix show ever
i like
it is the best damn life of money remixing show on my three sixty five we
We know this for a fact.
Yeah.
Yes, all one of them.
Loser.
Friggin' A, yeah.
So, it's my show.
I try to have it prepared before, you know,
I go live.
Sometimes I do, sometimes I don't.
Like, this week I just kind of pulled it together
five minutes after the show started, so.
Is this the out of the act guy?
Yeah, they all are.
Now, if I'm not mistaking,
Don't we have a new Loki remix we're debuting tonight?
Yeah.
Ah!
We'll do that towards the end of the show because, um, because, yeah, speaking of pulled
out the ass, yeah, that remix was, that remix was probably the second least, yeah, probably
the second from the bottom for the least effort put into a remix, but it's pretty cool.
I have banned that guy 5 times on VDR.
What? No stylings?
JB Horne.
Are you done horning out Live Wire?
Yeah, speaking of whores, plenty of whores on Live Wire.
Lots of whores and mass bondage.
In fact, we're just gonna play like pornos.
Hey, do you want me to loan you my whip?
Nah, that's alright.
Are you sure?
He has his own collection in the closet.
Just have handcuffs.
And those are the lame handcuffs, too.
Are they fuzzy handcuffs?
No, they're plastic handcuffs I got with the Lupin kit.
No one missed it.
I got it. This is great.
Anyway, we kind of cut Shane off.
I feel bad because Aaron gave us a chance to openly whore out our shows and we just jumped all over it.
were like, screw the guy who came out here 1,700 miles.
I think that we just hopped on that one
and dry-humped that segment.
Plenty of dry-humping on Live Wire.
We apologize for dry-humping your monologue.
You may now continue.
OK, dry-humping the monologue, sex with my dad,
sex with my uncle, God.
Although you can't decide.
I didn't really have anything else to say except for it's awesome here and I miss it
I didn't really have anything else to say except for it's awesome here and I miss it
a lot. Anybody else have anything to say, Rob?
Is somebody trying to ban No Styling? No, I'm copying his quote, so don't ban him. We
need comic books. I'm not banning him, you retort!
Will somebody just... We need to keep our eyes on him. We're alive.
We're going to do the FUs of the week right now.
But then we're going to go like half the show out of breaks.
Do you have to pee that bad?
No.
Okay, who has to pee in here?
Okay, we're doing the fuckies of the week.
It's a little warm.
I went before we left.
Are we there yet?
No.
Are we there yet?
No.
Are we there yet?
No.
Are we there yet?
Shut up.
Are we there yet?
Bang!
Oh wait, I lost the link for our forums.
Where are our forums Rob? www.calibomani.com
Click on forums.
In the corner, move the camera.
No, not on me.
Okay, let's...
So everybody, send Rob, flood Rob with private messages
with everything that pisses you off.
Alright, sounds good to me.
And then ping him.
God, our connection sucks enough thanks to Comcast.
And then everyone, ping No Stylin.
At once.
Don't ping No Stylin.
I think 23rd Magus needs to move more to your right.
Move toward the box.
Hump the boxes.
Move the coin door.
Be gentle.
Gentle?
By the way, for the record, diet vanilla Pepsi tastes like shit.
Because aspartame is bad for you, and it turns to a chemical that's like formaldehyde when
heated to body temperature.
Really?
That's why Propel is better for you.
The V8 is made with Splenda, it's the regular, it's not diet splash.
There's real V8 splash in the fridge. He'll go beat up a pineapple so you can have the
juice of the pineapple. This is really good radio. Anyway, so Rob, where's my music?
Sorry, we're still having some buffering issues. Son of a bitch. I'm going to buffer a Comcast
cast in about two seconds.
Okay, there we go.
Okay, the first one of the week
goes toward
one of the moderators on a forum that I will play on, and I'm not going to say the forum yet,
because I actually have no problem with everybody else, but this moderator
is abusing his power.
First of all, okay, this is funny, he accuses me of blaming.
Accuses me of, you know, all this stuff.
The first thing is, how many boards do I moderate on now?
Five, six, seven boards?
An admin three?
Okay, this has struck me, so I've reported
into the side admin, shall we get it in here quickly?
Unless, you know, he's, you know,
drug-humping the admin, then, I don't know.
We'd probably have to be doing more than dry humping the admin to get away with that.
You know, I would give the admin of this site more credit than to have such poor taste, so we'll go ahead.
But, you know, if it turns out that there's no resolution to this soon, then I'm going to do some very public announcements
and, uh, possibly, uh, report the, uh, site to the, uh, to their, uh, sponsors.
Ooh. Because, you know what? There's, there's few things that I tolerate. Everyone knows
me. If I have a problem with the service, even if it's free, oh, I will let them know.
I will let them know. So, yes, I am a good moderator who hardly checks the board anymore.
But no, um, that was really my only thing, and one goes, you know, I was really, I guess,
nobody came to my house to get me people, so I was, so I was there, um, and then, and
So I was there, um, and then really nothing else happened.
Ugh! Alright. It's evil, Sandy.
FINE! I just deleted it off the damn playlist, too.
Rrrrrrrrr!
You guys are never satisfied.
kostjamrh Just keep it. Aaron says they won't be satisfied until you start doing sexual favors.
F.E. to the fact that my stuff costs so much for this damn cabinet, why can't it be free? It's just wood. Trees are dead anyways.
F.E. to the fact that Lowe's doesn't have the size brackets I need for my keyboard tray, so I couldn't get them after wandering hours through that store looking for keyboard tray bracket thingies.
That sucks, but what else.
Oh, I asked you for a cable going out because I was downloading Evil Bed 1-2, Army of Darkness, and Into the Woods, and that stopped about 77%.
I asked you if the people at my work said you suck. You really annoy me.
I have no choice. I can't go down. I have to go up.
I'm just like counting the seconds.
F.E. to NASA.
You know, crashing something that costs 1.5 billion dollars is pretty stupid
just because you didn't want to contaminate a moon on Jupiter
with bacteria that might be on the satellite probe.
Who gives a flying fuck what happens to the moons of Jupiter?
They can fly away and smash into Neptune for all I care.
It doesn't really matter.
They financed that deal when they were trying to unify and automate all of the McDonalds.
to where it, like, you know, registered everything that every store did, but of course that failed and the company lost a lot of money.
Um, FQ2VRAA and MPAA, because you think that you know how to stop people from file sharing?
You know, it's kind of funny because I do remember Napster, you know, and how nothing changed and it's only gotten worse.
So what do you think is going to happen this time?
This time you think it's going to magically solve itself, and oh, people are going to stop because they're getting sued.
No, when you look at the statistics and you have 261 people out of millions of people downloading stuff, that's a pretty small statistic.
Hell, getting struck by lightning, you have more chance than you know.
F.E. to Hurricanes, because they're windy.
Also, F.E. to the fact that I bought these spinners and I can't use them for anything.
That sucks, and I cry.
Those spinners are so nice.
F.E. to people who don't like me talking, because I don't care what you think,
and I'm going to keep talking over and over and over again,
over again and we're going to keep rambling on and on and make the segment
go longer than it really needs to will you talk during the mass bondage orgy oh
yes I'm doing play-by-play for that mass bondage orgy and um f you for not being
super duper rich so I can have an outing at a strip club
Because I was going to buy about another six ferrets, but none of them freaking squeaked.
That would have been hilarious.
Darn. Big darn.
Don't worry.
But anyways.
Chomp that music.
My turn.
My um, my FUs for this week start off with the one and only Comcast, I hate you, you
burn in hell, I hope you catch SARS, and I hope your dick falls off.
You suck.
We have like, our listeners are going through hell tonight trying to listen to this show
because you guys are assifying our connection.
I just made a new verb, acidifying our connection, and you suck, and, yeah.
Well, Comcast may be a guy, but it drives like a woman.
Just kidding, just kidding, just kidding.
Just kidding, God.
That joke was too easy, come on.
That joke was way too easy, come on!
Anyway...
The feng shui of the highway!
Aaron's ranting about old drivers.
Well here, here's the mic.
That's pretty much all I have to ask.
You know what, I'm sure there's plenty of other things I could be mad at right now,
but Comcast takes the fucking cake.
F.U. is microphone quick because I swear to God it's trying to kill me.
Yeah, you have to listen to him.
Wait, no, that was last week.
Alright, moving on, let's hear from our other guests.
Let's start, I guess this Erin has a mic, we'll let her go.
Erin, what do you want to say F.U. to this week?
First of all, another big F.U. to Comcast.
I hope that you guys all rot in hell.
And I will go after you all.
I swear to God, you're worse than AOL.
You all know how AOL is.
Another big F.U. goes to the governor's race right now.
I don't trust Bustamante.
Governor Gray Davis is an idiot, and Schwarzenegger
doesn't know jack shit about politics.
And unfortunately, that looks like the future of our state.
Yeah, vote for the porn star, people!
Oh, you're running.
Jokes!
Jokes. No, we're fine, just keep going.
The problem is, there's a problem between, somewhere between Comcast and Live 365 right now,
so when we're trying to upload the show to Live 365,
we're dropping out, massively.
I mean, but we're still recording as a whole show.
He said Dropout, and we're playing Dropout.
who start drama over Initial D.
Now,
I've been around DDR3 growing enough to know, okay, it's huge, I know there's drama.
And when there was drama in the Para community, I just said, fuck it, I'm leaving.
Okay, but when you start drama in the Initial D community, what kind of idiots are you?
Okay, just because
some guy is going out with some girl doesn't mean you're going to start spreading rumors about him.
It's not a high school anymore, get over it!
This goes to the people who post on the Initial D thread on the board that I mod.
You guys start Drama again, I will go after all of you.
Initial D has its own thread? That's sad.
He'll tell you.
I'm starting the pole position thread on DDR Free.
You're a loser. No one plays pole position anymore.
I play pole position anymore. Screw you.
That is my ultimatum to all who post on the initial d-thread. I am counting warnings right now, so don't piss me off. And I am nearing that time of the month, so don't piss me off.
Because if you do, I will go fly. I know people who have large, large swords, and I know where you all live.
p0k3smot42o is that a sexual innuendo there?
I mean weapons, actual weapons, metal, sharp metal swords that will slice them all up.
It's nice that the boards are quiet right now.
Probably from a fellow moderator of those boards, it's kind of boring now when there's like three new posts a day.
Well, it's actually kind of nice because you have people posting all the intelligent people true
If you notice we have no we've had no easy end people. They've had no flame wars. You've had no drama. We're pocket
Okay, tonight is giving away all right well
Well, well.
Actually now that you've blown our cover, there's no Oliver either, thank god.
Nice!
I'm done with my FUs other than the fact that a big FU goes to my apartment for the leaky toilet, the noisy fan, the lack of vents which will suffocate me one day and I'm going to kill my landlady, and the wobbly furniture.
So yeah.
umm what did you do to andrew?
get
out
the jokes people don't
so yes that's that's one of them uh...
go to hell with your fifty seven dollars a month and
i've been down anyway

to all the people in Nevada and Northern California that lock their keys in the car and leave
their lights on because it makes my life a living hell. So, that'll be it. Um, let's
hear from Shane. Um, first off, F you to Elko, Nevada. I wanted Taco Bell at night because
I hadn't eaten anything all day. And is it so hard to keep your stupid store open until
Like, 10-01, frickin' closing at 10.
F-you to old people, because I was at Taco Bell,
and this old guy slammed his door into my parked car
and tried to blame it on me, because he's old.
And F-you to my living situation,
because I sleep out in the living room,
because they can't seem to find room for me in their rooms.
So, yeah.
and if you did driving the california instead of playing because it's really
boring

well i mean i was a little
each for the matter anyway
when i was trying to make if you go ahead there you should have a little
yeah i was going to have those music stuff in there
well, fuck his stuff. You're more important.
We're trying to kick him out by raising his rent. I was going to say, sorry if you're listening, dude,
but that's not cool to make somebody sleep on the couch unless they're not paying rent if you're being nice.
And my computer's in the corner, so I can't, like, get any privacy.
Oh my God.
You're robbing this man of his Internet pornography. That's horrible. That's great. Jeez.
Anyway, um, yeah, that's all my F's, so...
Thank you.
Andrew.
First of all, Victor, F you to you, you're not funny, I want my name back, I want my jokes back, bitch.
All five of them.
Second of all, F you to people who get my attention by picking up the phone when I'm online.
Stop it. I'm playing Ragnarok. I'm trying to bend.
Don't take the phone into the hand. That would be beautiful.
Either that or I rig up a timer to turn off the TV every time I pick up a phone.
Or just the phone that she uses. Just pull the cord out from the back so she picks it up and doesn't do anything.
Oh, sure. She just goes into the other room and picks up her phone.
Unplug that one too.
We've got door locks, so...
Anyway, uh, F you to Sakura, that song is a bitch, past it, like, what, fifth try.
No, get that whip away from me, Jamie!
In case you guys are wondering, that's the two ferrets tied up with, uh, my whip.
On the webcam.
Yes, on the webcam. So, go ahead, Andy.
Okay, okay, okay, how about a mutual F you to like in the max, okay? Just to make it balanced.
Holy shit, she's gonna hit me.
And once again, f you to Angel not being able to tune in today.
It's for what? A month and a half.
Oh shit!
Parrots flying everywhere!
Is that Orlando?
Uh, yeah, that's it.
Okay.
Oh, you didn't do it for me? I'm sorry.
I need to rant a little.
Come on!
Jeez, watch out here.
I don't think any of these balls can sit there.
Bling that ferret.
Okay, um...
Like, uh, yeah, what should I say?
I don't agree!
Fuck you to, uh, fuck bad, uh, bike tires
because my tires on my bike is sitting flat in my room
because it was broken and I need to get stressed for it.
And meanwhile, there's Barrett Baseball going on in the living room.
Look, he almost tripped. I can give play-by-play of Barrett Baseball.
Look, look. Basing up the middle. Andrew Fielding, the throw home.
Oh, I'm getting kind of distracted by the fact that Loki is batting a ferret around
the room.
And, uh, let's see, well, one of the, that's, damn it, I forgot my FUs!
Come on, you can remember!
Don't miss me, Jamie, no!
I think I have a lot more insanity here!
I'm gonna back up now.
I'm going to back up this way out of Jamie's race.
Ah, barely, yes, out of the race, okay.
p0k3smot42o
kostjamrh Hey listen, there's you the ferret. Dear ferret, what do you think of Orangetown's radio?
kostjamrh Now I can finally change the music, cause it's time for the chat room, if yous.
kostjamrh Give them something happy.
Dartsetsuya would like to say F you to comcast, enough said. Thank you.
It's com crap.
Evil Naoki2Dx would like to say fuck comcast for sucking major donkey nuts. Thank you.
Fuck BT Cruisers, fuck Initial D battle whores over a Riptard arcade.
Fuck elitist anime con goers who bashed on JTAF just because it was a small con and it wasn't exactly like A-X or anime etc.
I have something to say, in addition to your initial Battleforce comments.
Yeah, because they start too much drama.
I don't know why, I don't know why you guys...
Yeah, that's all it is, just drama.
Whatever happened to the times when there was no drama, when everyone was happy?
Why do you think I play at home?
Yeah, you don't need to start drama over every single person's life, please stop if you read to the board
I will be very very angry
Fuck this live 365 operator guy
Because when they can't connect to the stream when we go out like 365 operator guy comes on says you're listening to station
But it's currently unavailable. Please check
It would be better though if they have like some lounge music playing
Yes, Tom Jones
Moving on with Eva Maoki, 2DX's nephews, oh and fuck the lazy ass volunteers who didn't
do shit in the video game room at JTF and just wanted to get into the con for free.
And fuck the hotel maids at Best Western Miyako Inn for giving me a hard time.
A hard time.
And fuck Uni's dad for being such a cheap ass.
No Stylin says my nephew of the week is screw little rocks you find in charcoal.
I mean, God, you buy the good brands and you still get little pebbles in there.
I go, what the fuck?
I mean, you pay $1.99 for a stick of good old charcoal, and you get this little pebble.
It just messes up a good drawing, grr.
Oh, I thought it was barbecue charcoal.
You can do really good drawings with barbecue charcoal, though.
John Fields would like to say, F you to my inability to learn new languages quickly.
F you to Honda for forgetting to order the part for my car and thus wasting my Saturday.
F you to RCN for not fixing my cable again.
Hey, at least they're not as bad as code gals.
F you to my GameCube making weird clicking sounds and causing PSO to crash all the time.
That's not good.
What would you...
What does it mean if a GameCube is making clicking noises?
That can't be good.
Victor, you are actually winner for saying that AOL equals Governor Davis.
Thank you.

thanks a lot
and
and
our buddy down in the southwest
says an f u myself for missing like three orange lounge radios
unacceptable fired
F.U. to Live365 for being Microsoft's whores
Jason would also like to say
a F.U. to stupid computer crap happening to keep me from listening
You can blame Comcast, send those cards and letters to Comcast
Kara of Satan
StaplerX would like to say F.U. to the assholes of J.T.A.F. also
They took 10 years off our video program head's life.
You should let me run a movie room at one of those cons.
I never found out, though.
D-Archaholic says, F you to cheap tires.
I had cheap tires on my car for a while.
Yesterday, as I got off the freeway going home,
my steering wheel started to wobble.
I knew it had to be a tire.
That's it.
I have read all the FUs that I have been given.
So if you'd, oh, did one just pop up?
I got home and found the driver's side front tire starting to shed its tread.
I took it to Sears.
The story is coming in a little bit too.
While the story is going on, I'm going to say I have read all the FUs at this point.
If you didn't hear yours due to a buffering issue, sorry, we were just trying to go through
the show as we usually do.
The show will play in its entirety without these buffering problems, hopefully, provided
live 365 isn't using Comcast the show will play through in its entirety on Wednesday
and Thursday and we might actually we might play it tomorrow night after vanilla sky as
well.
DD alcoholic says took it to Sears all four of the tires need to get fixed.
All four, sucks.
She says actually only three were bad but she might as well change all four.
Tonight, what do you guys think?
I don't know if we should do a cage match tonight because of our issues.
Yes, we're doing a cage match.
Well, what about because of our issues?
The guys aren't going to be able to vote.
They're not able to stay on the stream long enough to hear a song.
I went to a lot of trouble.
Poopy on Comcast.
I went to a lot of trouble.
Should we table it to next week?
Okay.
Yeah, I think we're going to...
we could
okay we could do it this way
we could instead of, well I don't know, I could say instead of letting the chat room vote
we could let everybody else here vote but that might be kind of
tough and biased
I don't know
what do you guys think?
Hey, are we going to do cage match and have you guys vote?
we can try to let the listeners do it, let's see what happens
let us know what you want to do, do you want us to try cage match?
5 votes in the chatroom, then we're tabling it over to the room here, so that's what we're
going to do.
Okay.
It's not a big deal, but it's pretty nice.
Oh, sorry.
She didn't write earlier.
Okay.
That's okay.
It happens.
Okay.
They're saying the stream's okay right now, so we're going to do the cage match right
now.
Why not?
Let's just get into it.
We're doing a commercial free show tonight, apparently.
That's all right.
the money's too commercial anyway
hahaha
i was funny
and no one noticed
hahaha
last week in the orange lawns radio cage match
the mp3 that i was sent from dr angel one
and it was a mislabeled mp3 actually i found out a little just after the show
i found out the mp3 was actually mislabeled
you voted for the wrong thing actually
I said on the show that it was a band called Froggy that won, it's actually Foggy, no R.
So the band that actually won last night was Foggy, I'm sorry last week, last week, was
Foggy and the song is called Come Into My Dream.
So this is the song that won last week.
Huh?
You wet?
Are you downloading the show?
Oh good.
Alright, so here it is.
Um, this is the first song you can vote for tonight.
Why are you guys laughing?
Chat room.
Chat room says, just died.
As he said, do it this, they say the stream's okay right now.
So we're going to do, and apparently we dropped right there.
I think it's still going to work enough for the, uh, for the case match.
so
i'm gonna continue
you know what my monitor stream is still going so
i think they'll be able to get in
soooo cage match
Since we're having a moment of dead airspace, let's offer a moment of silence for our stream.
Let me show you where I've been It's you and me I've seen
Let me tell you what I mean In the deep blue sky
There were rainbows in the night, you and me to fly
And the ocean shines so bright
And the ocean shines so bright
That was a clip of song number one, last week's winner, Foggy with Come Into My Dream.
Once again, since we're still having some bad connectivity problems, if we don't get
enough people in the chat room and please don't vote chat room you're on your honor
tonight please don't vote unless you heard enough of the song where you think you can
make an honest vote of all the three songs so if we don't get enough votes from the chat
room we're going to vote in house so because of that i'm going to only ask for scores and
feedback from the hosts on the next two songs usually usually we let the whole room comment
and I had it on repeat for a while
and then I think that I just had it on my playlist I put it in there because
I didn't really put any thought into it
alright, so you ready to hit?
It's Free Fall featuring Jan Johnston with Skydive.
The first moment before the first touch When you're alone, we have to hold each other
I've been drawn in love, now stuck away beneath
Now we're here, we have our own language
I feel wonderful, I could spell out all my sorrow
I say, oh, she's my friend
I'm a fan of sex when my friend screams my name
I take it as I pray
To run, run, run, to the moon
I feel like falling
This is me before the finish
You know the money we have to hold each other
As we travel in love, we suffocate your knees
Now we're here
We have our own language
Connect your words
I haven't really gone
Excited to smile
Even if you're in my sleep
No wish, no lust, no lie
As true as our love
You're my hero
Heaven did you come
I feel wonderful, I can start out from the moon
I sail an ocean on my feathers as the wind screams my name
Take your hand and pray to run, run, run to you, you, you
I feel wonderful like a skydive on the moon
I feel a shiver on my bed with a smile on the bed
Scream my name, take it out, I'm afraid to run, run, run
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
free fall featuring Jan Johnston with skydive let's go around and see what the host thought
Free Fall featuring Jan Johnston with Skydive, let's go around and see what the hosts thought
and
why don't we please
you don't give
replace uh... politically jim johnson that would be awesome good idea to your
konami
uh... so there you go we wouldn't usually this point go around and see
what our other guests that we don't care what they think we don't care what they
think no
no
What did you pick today?
I picked this one because, you know, whatever. I made it today. It's cool, I guess.
It's the Fly, the 2003 Burst mix. It's just a Burst style, I should say.
Blatantly ripping off of the, what is it, B-Rock You, 1998 Burst style.
The Fly 2003 Burst Style Loki Vs. The Deep Project
Alright, well let's have a listen anyway. It's Loki versus Deep Project with the Fly 2003 mix. Here it is, song number three.
LOKI VS DEEP PROJECT
I feel a little uneducated to make a vote because I'm not familiar enough with the original song, so I'm not sure how much it was actually remixed, but it sounded very much like a video game racing song. It was very good. I liked it.
I thought you said you mixed it with electro-tune, but I don't hear it. Is it really sped up or something?
the legend of trance to begin with because now i have to live up to that and that sucks
you still need to know the one that i asked for
was it the safari trance one no the safari trance one just won't work because no one's
that talented
well then what's the one you wanted to hear the one with um...
what was that release your mind
yeah it has to be tac
alright guys it's time to vote chat room if i don't get at least five votes
and please don't vote unless you feel like you can make you heard enough of
each time to make a decent vote if we don't get five votes in the chat room
the real room here the live room will vote instead so that's why we haven't
heard what the guests think of the song chat because they may vote on them so
let's let's hear a little recap I'm gonna play a little bit extended recaps
and I usually do because the buffering issues and say you guys I'll have a
chance to listen one more time because I know you are right okay yeah exactly so
A little bit of extended clips here, but just enough so you can get an idea of what's going on.
Here we go, first up, last week's winner, song number one, Foggy, Come Into My Dream.
All right, song number two, Free Fall, featuring Jan Johnston with Skydive.
Here it is.
Alright, song number three you can vote for tonight is Loki vs. Deep Project with the
fly 2003 mix
Alright, so those of you in the room, go ahead and write it down on the paper, the one you
you want to vote for, and fold your paper in half.
And then we'll look at them in a little bit.
Otherwise, chat room, if you guys were able to follow us,
place votes now, or a private message
to sky in the chat room.
Anyways, you wanted me to mention this,
because I mentioned this the other day,
and because it's also one of the songs I sampled,
which I might add was not very remixed, but whatever.
I added a better drum beat to it, and that's it.
Whoopee doo.
Anyways, so anyways, I was going to mention that F-Zero GX has three songs that sample
the song, or actually three songs that remixes the song, The Fly by The Deep Project, which
also, you might remember, was also sampled in The Legend of Max, which, shut up, you're
not even on mic, so shut up, shut up, shut up, okay, anyways, so, I was going to play
Well, clips from the three songs. Let's see here. Let's start off with the first one,
which was, it's basically these are all the character music for the characters in F-Zero
GX. We'll start off with Deathborn, which is one of the characters. And we played this
for my um, let's see anyways. Okay, here we go. Deathborn, that's a remix of a fly, believe
it or not, which is kind of neat. And then we've also got Blood Falcon's theme, which
was the one that I remixed, barely. I know it sucked. And it's probably a lot better
without the crap that I threw on top of it. But anyway, that's Blood Falcon's theme. And
then we have Black Shadow's theme, which I wanted to remix, but it just didn't work.
so uh...
anyway, this is just on Mission X, so it's kinda neat
F-Zero rocks, cause it's fast
but uh...
I admit, I knew from the get-go that that remix wasn't that great
right now it's gonna throw it in there anyways and cuz I just didn't care be
glad I didn't choose a chicken dance or something like that
Oh Rob speaking of the chicken dance there's some place that for the pre-show
and here in the break
I only got one vote for cage match from the chat room, so I think we're going to go ahead
and reveal the winner here, okay?
Alright, you guys ready?
Here we go, yep, everybody got him, I got five, so here we go.
Who is the winner?
juggle the ferrets. I wish I had the survivor tribal council song here but I
don't have it so I gotta I gotta find another song to fill in here. Play the
chicken dance Rob. There's neighbors up there. I got something even better.
Alright here we go. First vote! 70s porn fabulous. The first vote is for
whatever Loki's was called
so that's song number three
next vote
second song the one that wasn't foggy or Loki's so one vote for second song one vote for
third song
it can't be a tie with five people, impossible
unless somebody didn't write a vote
Song number three.
So Loki's song has two votes.
Jamie's song has one vote.
So here's a vote for song one, coming to my dreams.
So now we have one vote for song one, one vote for song two,
and two votes for song three.
It is possible to have a tie with five votes.
It is.
Two and two and one.
Right.
We might have a tie right here, but that's OK,
because remember, in case of a tie, the host picks.
the host who didn't get picked.
So here it is, the last vote.
So if it's a vote for song three, song three wins.
If it's a vote for song one or two, we have a tie.
Ready?
Ah, it's a vote for song number one.
So we have a tie between Foggy and Loki's pick,
song number three.
So Jamie, what?
Who should I vote for?
Who should you vote for?
I am getting some votes from the chat room.
Do you want to hear this?
Add them in.
Add them in?
Well, this is what's interesting.
Okay, we're going to add them in.
I don't have to make any decisions, yay.
Marin actually, well, this is the complicated thing.
Marin actually, oh, I shouldn't be saying who voted for what because I usually don't.
My bad.
Well, it's okay.
She voted for song two.
So, that gives us a three-way tie.
So, we're back to square one.
Put them all in.
This is a tough decision. This is a tough decision. I'll tell you why. I'll tell you
why this is a tough decision. Because Jamie hasn't won in a little while. I've actually
been winning the cage match. She hasn't won in a while. So I kind of feel bad. So I'm
like, okay, maybe we should let Jamie win. And I did like her song. On the other hand,
Loki put a lot of work into his song. Jamie just, Jamie just gets a song from the internet,
but Loki made his. If you want to feel better, I didn't put that much effort into that. Really,
I did not.
The song I picked, though, I was going to pick the Chicken Dance Techno mix.
Oh, God, I would have voted for that, no problem.
Wait, I have a happy alternative.
How about we just take the song that I sampled for the Fly remix, since it's better anyways.
It's a lot cleaner, doesn't have the loud drum beat over the top of it.
We'll use that instead of mine.
I'm thinking I'm going to give it to Jamie tonight.
Have a conversation and now we let the ferrets talk to you.
Alright so there's the cage match kind of a little bit fucked up.
uh...
uh...
i think uh...
them and i think i know
who isn't there actually some of the money news going on right now no
yes there is i think we have something he wants to share with you all
people still play that the money crap
right
well let's see uh... what are you got going here
Well, I know that there's the, um, what was it, the new, um, the Tokyo Gaming Show is
going on right now, and I know that they had, um, a bunch of Konami games, um, that they
were showing up.
Uh, let's see, we've got, um, we've got our internet not working, and, um, okay, here
we go.
Uh, the modem's up.
I know, it's just being slow.
Anyways, um, there was, um, of course they were showing off DDRStream, which we now pretty
much know it's going to be exactly like Max 2 is right now. What are you doing? That's
fine. Anyways, so you have, you know, DDR Extreme obviously was coming out and of course,
you know, it's pretty much featuring the same stuff as Max 2 USA is, you know, as far as
the enhanced, you know, diet mode and that kind of stuff. Then there's a new DDR game
which I'm trying to find a name for right now. Party Mix, I guess. Fancier Revolution
It's Dance Dance Revolution Party Collection, in other words I think it's Dance Dance Revolution
Best Hits number 2.
And you're pretty much going to have, you know, it looks like it's going to be based
off the DDR Extreme Engine, you know, they don't really show anything other than Diet
Mode and, you know, standard beginner stuff. So, it has beginner and Diet Mode, you know.
Other than that, no, obviously, there's going to be, you know, DDR Max coming out next Thursday
or Wednesday, days away. And so, we'll be getting that if I have money. And then, what
else. Oh, yeah, we've also got kind of segue into SimNews. StepMania is at StepMania 3.9
Alpha 5. And so, one thing that's fully supported now is the Dance Magic Mode that's fully supported
now. It works. It's done. And another thing I thought I'd mention because a lot of SimSites
are down and you can't find your sim files. But now, now you can go find all your known
official sim files at www.ddramerica.com slash bttracker and you'll have all your torrents
for every single, every single like batch, you know, collection of files that was featured
One second, go!
Okay, got it.
Ferret tail sack from the cab.
Hot ferret action!
Yeah, that's pretty much that, and um...
In other news, my cabinet's coming along quite nicely.
That's it, yeah.
That's all your Bumani news.
Oh, and um...
Yeah, Tack did something, and uh...
What?
And Davey perks up like a cat.
What did my man do? I still have to marry him, you know.
Well, actually, I was going to mention this. I'm trying to remember where I saw it. I think it was Bomani Style. Oh, I say Bomani Style.
Thanks, I forgot about that. F you to Bomani Style for putting music on your front page. You suck. What are you thinking? Seriously, okay, now, actually, we really, really like Bomani Style. We do, Logie, we do.
I don't like your music. Your music sucks.
I don't mind it being flash, because DDR Maniacs is the same thing.
DDR Maniacs puts a cookie on your computer so that if you turn it off, it stays off every time you go there.
If you want it on, you leave it on. But I don't like it on. I like it off.
It looks like they took down all the media.
Well, that's because of TAC.
They took down the media because of TAC.
You can thank TAC for all the media being gone on
Yeah, so but anyways I was gonna say that um, there's that um, what was it that beat mania
concert live thingy
2dx
Yeah, 2dx secret concert
super secret concert anyways
that was going on and
There supposedly there was some new songs brought out
for that. I'm trying to see if I can pull this up here. I just want to say really
quickly because Jamie's going what huh? If you actually read there's a big long
post on BimaniStyle where they talked about where they're taking down the
media and basically most people kind of know by now that read the forums
frequently of BimaniStyle that TAC has been in touch with the people that run
BimaniStyle.com and that they were going to try and find a way to
to distribute Bounce Connected in the US
through bimanistyle.com.
And somehow along the way, though, it's
kind of been inferred.
And I haven't seen a confirmation
in this thread of this or whatever, but somehow it
got around that Tack actually asked
that the media be stopped.
Which is interesting because I had also
heard that he didn't mind so much because he
was excited that people outside of Japan
liked his music so much.
So I don't know, it could have.
It could be a combination of things though, also if you look in this thread you read a
lot about bandwidth whores and things like that, people that just leech all day long
and stuff and they kind of want to explore other parts of what they could do with a money
styler than just being a leech in today's place.
That makes sense.
Anyways, I was going to say that the 2DX here at Live Party Performances, here is the playlist
for the performances.
You had set one which is by Tack and he did abstract, electro tunes, slag work, stoic,
holic, D-X-Y, quasar and traces, so that was kind of neat.
And then you have Slake was set two, did Breeding, Music to Your Head and a new song which is
untitled right now.
Set three was done by Whack which did Linus, Spica, Over the Clouds instead of Regulus,
Make a Difference, Murmur Twins, Linus and Moon Child.
And then Akira Yamaoka did Bitmania, In My Eyes, Rizlim, some song in Japanese, a new
song with no title, and then Good Cool did Never Let You Down, Spin This, Your Body,
Come With Me, and Spooky.
And Naoki did Prelude, B-Rocky, and Platonic XXX, the new song that he's going to be doing.
Then you have DJ Taka, which is Tomorrow's Perfume, Colors, Pandora, the new song by
DJ Taka, Motion 2003, and Rainbow Flyer, the vocal version.
So that was kind of neat, and hopefully we'll get MP3s of those new songs soon.
And the vocal version of Rainbow Flyer was actually not done by Sana, it was done by
Noria was actually there. Noria being the one that did Glorious Days and the Happy Handbag Song in 9 style. Can't remember what the hell it's called.
And, uh, Platonic- I'm just picturing the video where she's holding the little happy handbag. What the hell's it called? I know, I can't remember the name of it either.
Anyways, Platonic XXX is supposed to sound like a Japanese version of Secret Rendezvous with rapping.
What?
Yeah
With rapping
So you know what that means, it's probably gonna be the next DDR so I mean that's kinda cool
I don't think that's a bad thing
I mean it's not bad
Jeez
Sylvia Drive
That's what I was trying to get Sylvia Drive
I love it
That's a great, that's a great signature right there
Nigga stole my bike
Sorry
Put that up on the TV thing!

It tastes like crap.
Pringles?
The original Pringles suck.
No, no, no.
The original Pringles, Pringles now, Pringles in the future will all suck.
F.U. Delays for trying to copy Pringles and put their stuff in a can.
Just because you put your chips in a can does not make them any better.
And what is up with Pib Extra? What is extra about Pib Extra? It tastes exactly the same.
I have no idea.

i'm done
i'm thinking you guys
what do you guys think about just making
where'd jamie go?
what are you guys thinking about just making it a two hour show tonight?
just like old days
Because we have new listeners, we're pretty much done with a lot of our topics, can't really interact with the chatroom tonight, so...
We're pretty much dead in the water, and we can all thank Comcast for that, cunts.
No, we don't have to know our...
So, um...
No listeners, huh? Not very many listeners?
Well, I mean, no, we have...
God bless the chatroom, they're trying to get in, they're hammering to get in, they're just trying their best...
Stop ramming the stream!
Everyone give a fuck you to live 365 for this sucking no no no it's not it's not
why 365 it's Comcast and life is just five link is fucked up so it's more
Comcast fault 365 should be over the head of being hammered their frickin
internet radio station that hosts thousands and thousands of internet
radio oh they're playing with my erotic poetry
So, I'm going to go around this time and get everyone's final thoughts.
Read the erotic poetry first.
So, Jamie has written, your vagina breath blows.
I have written, you suck enormous cock.
And now we're waiting for Jamie to do another one.
My girlfriend wrote, and this is, let me, um, this,
a dirty dog's, um, hey, what happened?
He took a nervous ca- okay, a dirty dog's a nervous cock plunged into my ass.
I swallowed his wiggling shaft, smeared-
He took some more words out of there!
And smeared his pudding on my pink pussy.
You're, you're a vagina plus.
Okay, that doesn't make any sense now, because there's stuff being removed.
Then I put velvet jelly love juice.
All right, let's get final thoughts.
We're going to start today with, let's start.
I'll start final thoughts with Andrew.
You don't pay me enough to think.
Shane, thank you so much for being here tonight.
And I'm sorry that Comcast sucks a big fat cock.
Yeah, I meant to give them a nephew just
to be cool like everybody else, but I forgot.
But thank you for being here.
Oh, thank you.
And I hope you had fun anyway.
I did.
Good.
We enjoyed Dance Summit, by the way.
It was fun.
Yeah, it's cool.
So, we'll see you.
It sounds like we may see you on Wednesday here for the Max 2 show, anyway.
Yeah, since I won't be in San Fran anymore.
Just cry.
Sadness.
Can you come over for vanilla sky if you want tomorrow?
Okay, yeah.
I'll have nothing better to do.
All right, we'll see.
We'll get somewhere.
Hopefully I can do that show.
We'll see.
Joey, thanks for being here again.
No problem.
Final thought?
Not really.
Congratulations on the three-footer once again, then.
Thank you.
That means, you know what?
If you keep at this pace, next week will be six-footers.
In three weeks, you'll have the Caddos down.
You'll be just like us.
Just like that.
I don't think I can work that magic, but I'll still try.
Poppy, sorry I drive out here all the way from Davis for an under par show, but they're
always interesting, aren't they?
Yeah.
At least I can actually know what's going on instead of having to sit at my computer
listening to a live station like no one else.
This damn signal thing annoys me.
Alright, Erin thanks for coming.
Sorry Erin that your first show had to be kind of a weird one, but you can thank Comcast
for that.
It's cool.
But I have a feeling you'll be back.
Miss Puppy.
Good.
Good, I'm glad to hear it.
Actually, I forgot to add one last FU. I kind of thought of it right now.
Oh, what the hell. Go for it.
It was to the scan you went to, was it? Sacramento's?
Yes.
Sacramento's for having a fucked up right side pad.
Because, yeah, on Max 2, I don't know why, but I ended up failing the whistle song maniac.
How? I don't know.
and uh... jamie wrote another piece of erotic poetry
taste her nasty burning crack cream
i don't want to know but yeah
so uh... fuck scandia for really fucked up pads
and stupid teeny boppers
ghetto quote unquote ghetto people
and the retards
And yeah.
Jamie, your final thought?
Logie, your final thought?
My mouth is full of cracker.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
My final thought is this.
We live in America.
It's about competition, being a capitalist society,
making money at the expense of other people.
I beg you, anybody that's out there listening,
sure west eighty and see what will not eighteen t because that's exactly part
of congress
sure west anybody out there that's listening
build a competitive cable company in this area
and bring it out there where we live
win first
god please any wolf with respect to it
bird bob i sure as to
does it always have to keep talking buying each other out accepted if you
have one first you can't and look at deviant art so don't go to them
And you might not see it on the webcam, but I just took off my pants.
Oh, no!
Why is that?
Not your pants.
Why'd you...
They banned it.
They blocked anyone with that ISP for actually going in and saving the pictures off their
site.
That's assy.
I beg any other competing cable company out there, please, please come out here and give
a competitive, give Comcast some competition.
They have a monopoly on the market.
This is the problem that we have.
The reason why this sucks, you guys, I would not put up with this shit, going through live
65 and Comcast.
You guys remember...
It's actually very good in the...
I'm talking dish.
You can't get win first out here.
Oh, this is bad.
Yeah.
Because actually, I've used their service at my friend's house and it's really good
service.
When, assuming that Loki and I move again in April, which I'm thinking is probably going
to be the case, I think we're going to go somewhere where we can get DSL instead of
cable.
Move closer!
Yes!
We'll see.
We'll see.
Or buy me gas.
We'll see.
Or build a teleporter.
What, Joey?
We don't need to talk about it.
You can't get SPC-DSL.
DSL is not supported up here.
Because we live out in Illinois.
All right, I'm done.
That's it.
I just beg somebody to compete with Comcast, please.
I need another option.
I don't like this monopoly they have on the market on high-speed Internet.
Loki.
What?
Final thought.
Oh, I have to contribute, actually.
Oh, I had a final thought.
Loki.
I thought you were going to gauge your final thoughts.
What?
Here's my contribution to your cabinet.
Whoo!
I got more change.
We could.
I want my coin to be the first one in the coin slot.
Sorry, I already put one in there.
It could be the donation box.
That's what it is.
For kind donations.
Money for me.
No, my final thought is...
Why does the sun have to be so hot?
Because it is.
I don't know.
It's because it's a big nuclear tank.
What do you get when you cross a bungee cord with an owl?
My ass.
Alright, final word of the show.
I'm going to give it to Shane because for God's sake she came how far out here?
I didn't give my final thought.
You did, didn't you?
general thought is my foot repeatedly kicking your butt and I'm done. Oh, by the way, in
regards to my F.U. of the week, again, I'm not really pissed off at that site. I'm pissed
off at that person. And I freaking hate people who abuse their power, so I hope that he catches
stars of the genitals.
Oh, I just want to say another F.U. to people that play this game. I know something you
don't know. I know something you don't know. I fucking hate that shit. I know something
you don't know, I know something you don't know.
I probably know lots of things y'all don't know.
But see, it's one thing to know it and keep it a secret
that you know it, but it's another thing.
I'm never telling you what the quadratic formula is, never.
It's another thing to be all like openly admitting you
know shit and you're just being a dick
and not wanting to share it for whatever reason.
I know what the antidote is.
For your mental retardation?
No.
He go nasty, he get nasty.
You really know what happen if you take the other pill?
The birth control pill?
I don't know, do you know something about that?
Nope.
It cures acne.
It cures acne?
Listen, really? I didn't do that.
Actually, my acne, when I...
Move your hand.
I...
Move your hand, don't take it off.
I have to say this, I was on birth control for a little while.
It made me an insane psycho bitch, but I had really good skin.
There you go.
If you take the red pill, I'll show you how deep this hole goes.
If you take the blue pill, I'll give you an erection.
Right, anyway.
Wait, hold on.
No, we can't have final word yet because I don't have the end of the show queued up.
Good job.
I'm with it today.
I'm just writing this show off, you guys, you know how like big companies when they
discover like million dollar debts they have and stuff, they just write it off?
Enron?
Yeah.
I think you guys were just writing tonight off.
This one needs to be like the lost episode.
Seriously.
This is one of the other lost episodes.
Jamie Dubbs is the lost episode.
was lost in the void, the big hole, cavernous vagina that is Comcast. Unfortunately, the
end of this show was lost on its way overseas, but it was finished by the Korean recording
artists. Hope you enjoy. For those keeping score at home, I just showed another dropout

need one more for that one more drop one more drop come on come on motherfucker let me let
me like bog down computer resources come on get it to drop again come on we need 37 we
need 37 in a row come on come on Aaron has something to say you know I really wonder
You know, I really wonder if we'll ever find a cock large enough to rape Comcast and be asked for everything they've done to us tonight.
I don't know, but I'd be willing to try.
Yes, big steel-dizzle up here.
I'm sorry, I don't think you're large enough.
I think it would have to be, like, a collective cock.
You know, that's like one cock together.
I think the cock has to be at least large enough so that in proportion to testicles should be about as large as bean bag chairs.
We could get Paul and Terry and give it a try.
Okay, Rod's over here dragging us. 37 in a row.
37 drop. Quick, end the show. Shane, final word.
Comcast.
You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio. Orange Lounge Radio is hosted by Dark Sakura, Skye and Loki. We expect you a nice play again. And now, here's your fortune cookie message of the day.
Don't play you hate on me. Play you hate somebody else.
Yo. Yo, yo. I'm a gangster. Where my dogs at? Bark with me if you're my dog. Yo, yo, yo. I'm going to give a shout out to all the player haters.
I don't like player haters.
If you're a player hater, don't player hate on me.
Player hate somewhere else.
I'm a gangster. I'm straight up.
Straight up a gangster, dude.
I'm a gangster, I'm a straight-up G. The gangster life is the life for me. Shooting people by
day, selling drugs by night. Being a gangster is hella tight. I walk around town with a
stark erection, then gave your mom a yeast infection. I saw the policeman and I punched
To serve and protect? What a lie!
I also don't like white people, you shouldn't too
And don't get me started about the Jews
I'm a gangster, grrr I'm mad
I'm a gangster, my rhymes are bad
I'm a gangster, I'm iced out like a freezer
I'm a gangster, I don't listen to Weezer
I dropped out of school at the age of three
Why?
Cause all the teachers tried to play your hate on me
Oh
My rhymes are cool, just like doing cocaine
My rhymes are hot, like a burning flame
Cisco is my homie, he's a gangster too
Me and Cisco are the leaders of the gangster crew
I like to be in jail and he likes to sing and dance
Some say we're the perfect match
Step off, step back, step away
Step back, don't step forward
Step back, don't step forward
Step backwards, backwards, don't step at me
I'm giving a shout out to my homies in cell block 8
Being in jail sucks cause you always have to masturbate
Except when a Jewish person goes to jail, all my homies cheer
They will make mincemeat out of his rear Ben Petty helped me make the gangster beats
in a song I shot him in the face cause he looked at
me wrong I'm a gangster
I drop bombs like Hiroshima I'm a gangster
Bitch suck on my wiener I'm a gangster
I drive a cool car, I'm a gangster, I smoke weed in a cigar, yo!
My gangster flow, yo!
Yo, yo, yo!
Yo!
Yo!
Yo!
Yo!
I'm rolling on dubs, ice out like hockey, I got kicked out of Japan for drinking all
the sake, fuck a bitch, give me head, hoe, what's up to my dogs, yo, yo, yo!
They're playing a song on the radio all day long
So everyone can hear my gangster song
Nobody thought I'd blow up like a firestone tire
Oh, there's no beat left
Die! Die, Santa Claus, die!
No, I don't want to do acapella
I like to slap bitches
I like to slap hoes
Thanks for listening, and we'll see you next week.
