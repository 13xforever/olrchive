287878	289079	Thanks for watching!
339594	340436	Thank you for watching!
368570	369352	Thank you for watching!
426158	426658	S, Actdeft,
474053	477741	Toto, I have a feeling we're not in Kansas anymore.
481368	486149	You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio, Ramani Talk, and then some.
486849	489550	Uh, mostly the, and then some, part of that.
489910	493951	Orange Lounge Radio is created by a bunch of potty-mouthed adults.
494551	499352	Orange Lounge may contain sexual, perverted, and mildly retarded content.
499932	503632	You probably shouldn't let your children listen to Orange Lounge Radio.
503953	505433	Yes, I will spank your child.
505833	507573	If you're not going to do your job, goddammit, I will.
509694	510814	Spank your spanker!
512165	514227	Well, here's to my big opening.
514747	515848	A sphincter says what?
516168	518150	I'm super, thanks for asking.
518530	521132	Oh, you little bitch troll from hell.
521152	523094	What am I doing here?
523214	524415	No.
524996	525616	Dodge this.
525636	528659	This is a tasty burger.
528899	531361	Look, you stupid bastard, you've got no arms left.
531581	532202	Yes, I have.
532662	534443	Look, just a flesh wound.
534684	540829	Searching for a boy in high school is as useless as searching for meaning in a Pauly Shore movie.
541869	542569	Oh yeah?
542809	546110	Well, I hope your babies look like monkeys.
546351	547411	DarkSakura.
547611	548391	I've got a sniff.
548751	549312	Skye.
549392	551492	But I'm playing it for the bartender, so suffer.
551852	552333	Loki.
552633	553633	I hate you!
554053	556114	Orange Lounge Radio.
558515	563656	We are live, and this is episode number 62 for September the 28th of 2003.
564197	567878	And tonight, the cable is working.
570197	573818	We promise here on Orange Lounge Radio, we won't scare you with any monsters.
577619	578119	What, what?
579620	585641	This is episode 62, the most fresh-smelling Orange Lounge Radio ever.
588582	594424	Can opener is in... No, it's in the second drawer down.
595644	597745	Second drawer down, not including the cutting board.
598845	599445	There you go.
602700	617928	and now in the Orange Lounge kitchen, Iron Chef Sakura and the mystery ingredient today is rice oh shit the mystery food today is eel
620552	622954	What is someone cooking Asian food to do with rice?
623475	623995	I don't know.
624896	625917	You guys want another microphone?
625937	626778	You guys can have this one here.
627158	628199	You guys might want this in a little bit.
631282	632223	Anyway, where was I?
632283	632624	Oh, yes.
633865	636007	This is episode number 62 for September the 28th of 2003.
636788	642153	You're tuned into the Bimani Scene's most F-Zero whoring radio station of all things Bimani.
642934	643795	My name is Rob Roberts.
643935	644896	You might know me as Sky.
646303	652587	Joining me as always are my awesome co-hosts, the happiest bunny on the farm, Miss Jamie Summers, you know her better as DarkSakura.
655649	656829	I'm playing with an eel.
657830	660131	In that corner, say hello to our tech massa, Loki.
661052	662373	I'm playing with a solder gun.
663773	664614	Oh my god, he's got a gun!
666035	666955	And it can burn things.
667336	670577	And also with us tonight, say hello to Puppy!
670878	672939	This is my third week in a row, it's a new record!
673059	674540	Oh my god, it's a new record!
678260	680061	Say hello to RKDN42.
680081	681722	Hello out there.
682462	683102	How you doing?
683362	683663	Okay.
684003	684383	Good to hear.
686204	689465	Also with us tonight for her first real show since last week.
689485	690866	We're just going to write off last week.
691746	693967	Say hello to ViolentHyperGirl.
694027	694468	Hello!
694708	696308	Or as I call her, ViolentHyperGangbang.
698629	701391	I think we have our whip again tonight because I forgot to take it out.
701411	702371	Did you not bring the whip?
702651	703091	It's there.
703552	703652	Oh.
707569	708790	No one can hear you, puppy.
708810	709910	It's only been a week.
714973	715473	All right.
716094	719356	God, we have a whole shitload of Imani news to talk about this week.
719496	721717	Obviously, Max 2 came out this week in the U.S.
721797	723338	Did everybody here get the chance to play it?
723998	724639	No.
725039	725199	No?
725519	726339	Everybody but Aaron.
726880	727180	Oh, well.
727280	728581	Aaron will have to live vicariously through our stories.
728601	729281	It's okay.
729361	730442	You played Max 2.
730862	733924	I have... You got the first four unlocks, Loki.
733944	734204	Shut up.
735324	736125	Well, actually, if I...
737290	739031	We'll be talking about Max 2 USA tonight.
739091	744372	In fact, we have the Orange Lounge Radio premiere of all the Max 2 USA exclusives.
744392	745993	We're going to be playing those throughout the show tonight.
746953	752415	And we ripped them ourselves, so... They're a little amateurish, but they got the job done.
752615	753715	Good job!
754095	758997	We got those and a whole lot of other stuff to talk about tonight, so we'll be back.
759037	762478	Cage match, possibly a list list if we have time for it.
763038	766499	All your favorite FUs of the week coming up a little bit later.
766739	766879	And...
768095	771276	Jamie Cooking, for all of you out there.
772616	775117	She'll be holding it up to the webcam and you can lick your screen.
775717	789560	So to get our webcam address, head on over to our website, www.callybomani.com, click on Orange Lounge, and click on Chat, and then our chat room will be more than happy to give you the link to the webcam, because it's got a really long URL and I don't say it over the air.
790380	791921	Alright, we'll be back after this.
791961	796342	We're going to start off with a little bit of ecstasy, bad routine, and busy child.
796362	796802	We'll be back.
800994	810666	A little better you and me A little better set you free A little better
848115	849716	I'll be your dream
896897	898812	A little bit of ecstasy
1010091	1010551	Get busy, child.
1010571	1010891	Get busy, child.
1010911	1011391	Get busy, child.
1042929	1043893	Get this inside!
1046548	1047629	Get 50,000 Get 50,000 Get 50,000 Get 50,000 Get 50,000
1086567	1095250	Please listen to Orange Lounge Radio Because real radio makes Captain Jack cry
1118311	1121513	Hello and welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 62.
1122053	1124754	And we're playing Max 2 USA MP3s tonight.
1124814	1127756	So in that break you heard A Little Bit of Ecstasy, Bad Routine, and Busy Child.
1127776	1129037	We're just going to hit them in alphabetic order.
1129077	1130437	We've got 15 songs to play tonight.
1131038	1134860	Five breaks we usually do, so we'll have just enough to put us through the rest of the show.
1136020	1139862	So, speaking of Max 2 USA, it's the big news this week, Wednesday.
1140102	1143143	We haven't had a new DDR game in the USA for over a year.
1143203	1146625	We haven't really seen any new DDR of any kind, unless you live in Europe.
1146965	1149907	You haven't seen any new DDR of any kind since Extreme in January.
1149927	1151427	So this is like big news this week.
1151988	1153828	So, what'd you guys think?
1154889	1156430	Best damn home version ever.
1157350	1157610	Why?
1158771	1163633	Because it's got so many licensed tracks that are unique to the game that they actually...
1164838	1168860	Put some thought into what songs to put in and actually did a good job of it.
1170520	1171421	Oh yeah, but this is better.
1171961	1178004	Max 2 is 20 times better.
1178724	1179444	Spine, whatever.
1180945	1181485	It is good.
1181505	1182526	Any particular favorites?
1184166	1187928	They had Xenon in it and I pissed my pants when I unlocked it.
1189230	1191652	You didn't spoil, I went and spoiled the list.
1191812	1194334	I went on Wednesday morning and read the whole damn list.
1194414	1195275	I just wanted to know.
1195375	1196616	I wanted to know what the hell was in the game.
1197516	1207604	I didn't even go online Wednesday until like the night when I was halfway through unlocking it when I was going to go online and see how far you guys were into it.
1208717	1209077	Yeah.
1209377	1211099	Hopefully you were listening to us on Wednesday.
1211139	1211639	We were playing live.
1211659	1212219	I didn't even care.
1212239	1213600	I don't care if it's a spoiler or not.
1214041	1214581	Two words.
1215341	1216342	Tomorrow Perfume.
1216502	1216982	That's it.
1217123	1219664	Tomorrow Perfume was an excellent choice for an unlock to the game.
1219864	1220405	Yes, it was.
1221185	1224788	I'm going to start off with a bitch, and it's my one bitch about Max 2 USA.
1224908	1227609	Otherwise, the game is fucking fabulous, but this is my bitch.
1228950	1232053	Almost one out of every three songs has been in a USA release before.
1232193	1234415	Including, like, half the unlocks.
1234475	1236836	Like, when I unlocked Afranova... Okay, no.
1236876	1240619	When I unlocked Put Your Faith in Me, I about threw a brick through the TV, okay?
1240759	1244282	I was like, if Loki hadn't have bought this brand new TV, I would have put a brick through it.
1244823	1246884	Because I was just like, what the hell?
1247004	1248105	Put Your Faith in Me?
1248345	1249266	At least it wasn't the jazzy groove.
1249286	1252889	I mean, if you're going to repeat something, repeat a good song.
1253869	1254730	That's my one bitch.
1255190	1258173	Otherwise, I like the game, but I just felt a little...
1258900	1259641	Cheated My Baby Mama
1273107	1282913	One of the coolest things, one of the things I freaking love about Max 2 USA is those fourth mix songs, Conga Feelin', Dream a Dream, In the Navy, third mix, fourth mix, whatever.
1283733	1285494	Those songs have been completely reinvented.
1286074	1288756	Oh yes, the fact that they're in 60 frames a minute.
1289577	1291379	And they have background videos.
1291419	1294602	Background videos fucking rule.
1294762	1295182	Oh, yes.
1295362	1297724	I'm almost a little disappointed that there weren't more of them.
1297944	1300707	Like, I was a little surprised that, like, Heaven didn't have its video.
1300727	1302849	Yeah, I thought there would be a video for that.
1303229	1305631	Okay, so they probably had licensing issue problems.
1305711	1305951	Fine.
1306332	1307233	So, you know, give it to them.
1307273	1307453	Fine.
1307473	1309354	They probably had to pay a lot more to license the videos.
1310575	1312177	The Days Go By video is pretty cool.
1312257	1312697	Yes, it is.
1313878	1314178	Oh, I know.
1314238	1315599	Loki made the Rice Crunch Retreat.
1317879	1318459	I'll tell you what.
1318939	1320740	Favorite video.
1320840	1322801	You know how many songs actually have music videos, though?
1323661	1324641	If you do the counting, six.
1324981	1326001	I think it's only six.
1326241	1327202	No, I thought there were more than that.
1327282	1333604	It's the two Captain Jack songs, Conga Feelin', Whistle Song, Love at First Sight.
1338445	1341566	Days Go By, and Four Strings.
1341786	1343707	Oh, maybe there is eight, because that's seven I just named.
1343767	1348629	Four Strings has a video, and then there's... Yeah, Four Strings has a video.
1348769	1352671	Four Strings has that video that has the trains in it and the green wall.
1353031	1357573	Nobody knew what video it was when you saw... Oh, yeah, you have to look at the Four Strings video.
1358233	1359713	The steps to that song are really good.
1359753	1361814	It's the one... You know how everybody thought... Look at the freezes.
1362134	1363515	You remember when the early, early...
1365106	1371109	Loki, you remember when the early, early pictures of Max 2 came out and they had the trains and everybody said it was Chemical Brothers Star Guitar?
1371430	1372590	It was actually the Four Strings video.
1373431	1373851	Yeah, whatever.
1376092	1378413	I was done with that game in one hour.
1379414	1381695	I was just like, eh, I'm over it.
1381775	1382336	You know what, though?
1383076	1386838	If we had, like, a working dance pad in here right now, I think I'd still be playing it every day for exercise.
1386858	1387398	Oh, yeah, doubles?
1387879	1388139	Awesome.
1390238	1395858	My ignition pad, mine, that I got as an alimony payment.
1397751	1401174	Yes, and we've heard about that pad so many times already, we don't need to hear it again.
1401194	1402175	You're right, we don't need to hear it again.
1402695	1407199	But, I mean, just the random old non-stop is keeping me playing it every day.
1407880	1411102	You know what, if I had a dance pad to play it on, not just controller, I'd be playing it every day too.
1411383	1420570	And you know what's weird, is I think between this, and I'm going to get into this later, between this and RVGL's recent turnaround, I'm like totally into DDR again, it's scary.
1421851	1430317	Except for the whole wobbly pad thing on Extreme and RVGL, I played one game on it and I was like... Other comments on Max 2.
1430637	1432218	You haven't been able to play it yet, Aaron, right?
1432498	1434879	Hopefully during a break we'll be able to sneak it on so you can see it.
1435860	1437001	Favorite video?
1437361	1437641	Puppy.
1438061	1438582	Favorite video?
1438862	1439602	Favorite video?
1441243	1441584	Let's see.
1442764	1443705	I have to go with...
1445872	1446793	In the Navy video.
1447873	1451214	I would say it's a tie because I love Conga Phelan.
1451374	1452335	I love Vivian.
1452635	1453815	She's a fat Shakira.
1454235	1454816	I love her.
1455576	1459197	But Dream of Dream is so cool too, like the flying car.
1460478	1462259	There's a flying car in the Dream of Dream video.
1462299	1462739	It's awesome.
1463259	1465420	I think I have to say Conga Phelan though because like...
1465960	1472868	They changed... One thing you may not know if you haven't picked up Max 2 USA yet, they changed all the backgrounds for the fourth mix and before songs that have videos.
1473188	1476792	So Conga Feelin', Dream of Dream, they all have new backgrounds that are stills from the music video.
1477112	1480396	The Dream of Dream background is the best DDR background ever.
1481197	1481557	But the...
1482538	1487660	The Konga feeling video is like this shot of Vivian, and she has her mouth open and her eyes squinty.
1487821	1488521	It looks scary.
1488581	1493323	I think it's a throwback to the original 4th Plus video, which was the girl with her mouth open.
1493623	1496745	But the way they got the freeze frame and the video... The videos were ghetto.
1496965	1497405	That's it.
1497665	1498125	They were ghetto.
1498185	1499266	It looks like a cum shot.
1500806	1503088	Like Konga feeling, because Vivian's got her mouth open.
1503108	1504148	She's like, oh yeah, baby!
1504168	1506929	What about Captain Jack's background for Dream or Dream?
1506949	1507910	Dream or Dream was awesome.
1508190	1510491	He's just like... He's like, scary monster man.
1512822	1513823	Shittiest background.
1514704	1515825	Shittiest new background.
1519128	1520389	The love at first sight video is scary.
1520409	1521911	You should watch the whole thing.
1523072	1525074	I would say... I don't want to watch the whole thing.
1525114	1527036	Shittiest background is days go by.
1527196	1527657	I'm sorry.
1527757	1532461	I don't... Because that shot of the guys in the car, they like keep showing that in the video.
1532501	1534143	They're actually... It's because they're the singers.
1535263	1543225	Oh, well, I... You can't really see it much because the videos are so low-res, but they're actually singing the song in the background.
1544186	1544366	Oh.
1545046	1545686	Well, it sucks.
1545706	1546666	I don't like the Dream Dream background.
1546686	1551588	That's a video, though, that I need to get the whole thing of, though, because... Yeah, that's the worst video.
1552268	1552588	But, no...
1553508	1559472	But no, for Days Go By, the whole video, I really want to see it because it's supposed to actually have a whole story to it.
1559492	1567116	Oh yeah, it has subtitles too, which somehow, I think they totally edited the Max 2 USA one because it has no subtitles.
1567377	1569658	So I think they totally picked and chose different clips.
1569878	1572520	Because if you notice, if you watch the Kylie video, they had to edit that too.
1572740	1574621	Because they had to edit it to go with the edited song.
1574641	1579104	I think this is also turned into widescreen on the...
1580665	1582205	I didn't pay that close attention, unfortunately.
1582225	1587769	I thought they changed the ratio so that it wouldn't show where the actual subtitles would have been.
1588649	1589009	Maybe.
1589029	1589950	They may have done something like that.
1590830	1595693	If you want to comment on Max 2 USA with the rest of our listeners, www.callybomani.com.
1595713	1597474	Click on Orange Lounge and click on Chat.
1597754	1600076	We'll be playing Max 2 USA MP3s throughout the evening.
1600136	1603378	We also have the three brand new songs in DDR.
1603718	1604498	That's my next question.
1604518	1606339	What did you guys think of the brand, brand new songs?
1606359	1607240	They've never been in DDR before.
1607640	1611603	I'm sorry, the Konami originals that have not been in any game yet.
1611943	1613625	Like Forever Sunshine and all that stuff.
1614225	1614545	Fun.
1616146	1618468	Forever Sunshine came out of my ass.
1618488	1620610	Like a liquidly brown goo.
1621150	1622211	That's what that song was.
1622431	1625113	We found a singer that sings worse than Paul Eteri.
1626074	1627535	We didn't think it was possible?
1629517	1631397	I gotta tell you, Try to Love You, I actually like that song.
1631417	1635418	Try to Love You has the chick from Let Them Move singing, and it's actually a really damn good song.
1635478	1635919	Yeah, it is.
1636339	1637419	It's Forever Sunshine.
1637439	1640240	The first time I heard it, it was like, eh, but it started to grow on me.
1641420	1642760	Forever Sunshine is awful.
1642800	1646621	It has Miss Piggy singing it, is what we were saying on Wednesday.
1647361	1650182	Ernie, Forever Sunshine, come here.
1651977	1652578	That's sad.
1655020	1661805	I wish they would have taken that one new song from Lesson Mode and actually put that into the game.
1661825	1665569	The biggest letdown is not having that song in the game as a playable song.
1665909	1667130	That's one we didn't rip.
1668331	1669292	That's one thing we've got to do.
1669312	1671394	I have an MP3 of it, too.
1673055	1677459	I actually just played through that whole section of Lesson Mode just so I could play that song in its entirety.
1677939	1681502	You know one thing that also impressed me about Max 2 USA I've got to say?
1681522	1682783	Did you watch the credit sequence?
1684144	1684405	No.
1684925	1690210	The credit sequence is actually really cool because it goes through all the stock videos and just plays them.
1690370	1691691	It's pretty cool.
1692331	1692632	Yes.
1694253	1695734	Oh, dangers with the video?
1696775	1698637	They don't show videos or characters at the same time.
1699592	1702814	When they do the three... I'm sorry, I'm talking about the busy videos.
1703155	1706477	When you have three dancers and then all the busy stuff.
1706997	1709118	And they all do their own dance, so it's really stupid looking.
1709859	1710619	You know what?
1710639	1712341	Sometimes they'll do the same dance.
1712361	1714182	Did you like the dancers overall, Jamie?
1714302	1715222	Did you think it was a good feature?
1717224	1719065	I liked that they were all cleaned up and cel-shaded.
1719085	1719665	They were really nice.
1720126	1721246	The characters looked gorgeous.
1721266	1723128	Cel-shaded rage is fucking pimp.
1723888	1726310	Do you think they totally stole that idea from Step Mania, though?
1727674	1730355	They could have, but somebody is insatiated.
1730395	1733176	You know what, they did it better in the USDDR, I gotta say.
1733216	1737497	But I'll tell you what, the best thing about those characters is when you get extra stage playing Max Unlimited.
1737537	1739198	Oh my god, they're seizuring!
1739318	1740018	It's funny.
1740618	1742739	It's like, hello, seizures.
1744040	1744820	It's crazy.
1746501	1750623	23rd Magus says in the chat room, the best song in the game was the Midnight Blaze remix in the menus.
1751424	1752304	That was an awesome mix.
1752344	1754345	Again, kind of a disappointment that that wasn't in there.
1754385	1755486	Was that the same one from VRare?
1755886	1756327	I think it is.
1756387	1757027	I hate System SF.
1759309	1761190	I know you hate System SF, but you'll get into it later.
1761210	1762951	I like that new Kind Lady remix.
1762991	1767153	It was actually kind of hard, and it was fun, and I liked it.
1767654	1768854	We're going to have that next week.
1768954	1771396	Next week we're going to have the US VRare 2.
1771536	1774558	Jamie has it, and she's going to bring it next week for us.
1776800	1780802	After the show tonight, by the way, Night Style, original soundtrack, we're going to play it for you guys.
1780822	1785663	Because we've been playing bits and pieces for you guys throughout the week, but I know most of you guys listen to the Tonight Show.
1786564	1790685	Didn't it go up on MGG, the first disc of Night Style?
1790705	1791665	I don't know, we had the whole thing.
1791825	1793146	We got it through a different source.
1794867	1797367	One of our studio regulars got it for us.
1798328	1799048	Okay.
1800268	1801229	I'll need to get a copy then.
1802409	1804190	I can't copy tonight, but I can get it for you during the week.
1804230	1804470	Anyway...
1805535	1806656	Anybody else want a microphone now?
1806676	1808677	Yeah, who wants... Anyone else want to comment on Max 2?
1808757	1809098	Loki?
1810138	1810519	Bradley?
1810579	1811379	I know you haven't played it.
1811419	1812760	Bradley, you have anything you want to say on Max 2?
1812840	1815602	I know you got a little bit out on Wednesday, but... Jamie!
1815622	1817023	What do you have to say about Max 2?
1817063	1818044	She's cooking.
1818064	1818584	She's cooking.
1819425	1820946	So I'm, like, stuck with the microphone?
1820966	1821787	Yeah.
1821827	1823468	What else is there to talk about with Max 2?
1824408	1828852	There's something, um... The non... I'm actually glad they took out OEs and replaced them with non-stops.
1829352	1830613	Because non-stops are much better.
1831053	1832974	Jason Enos is brilliant.
1833014	1833774	Yes, thank you.
1833994	1834534	Thank you.
1834714	1835574	That's what I forgot.
1835834	1839775	The information screen is like the best part of the unlocks.
1840035	1840635	Completely.
1840775	1842916	It is so hilarious.
1843876	1846737	And supposedly, the rumor is Jason Enos wrote all those himself.
1847097	1850198	I mean, we know he did for Max, and so we kind of assume he did for Max, too.
1851078	1851458	Who knows?
1851558	1855599	But those things were the funniest damn things.
1855619	1856099	You know what?
1856159	1858120	And there's one for every damn song in the game.
1858160	1859180	Yes, and they're funny.
1859520	1865827	Some of them are kind of generic, but some of the ones that use the worst puns ever are so great.
1867749	1873496	Honestly, that was part of the unlocking for me, was just getting to do the bad puns.
1875098	1875398	Yes, Jamie?
1875418	1875518	Jamie?
1877103	1882691	I didn't get a chance to check it out because I've been kind of busy, but I'm going to be using the workout mode in the game.
1883432	1885174	And it looks like it was tweaked a little bit.
1885214	1886876	Have you looked at workout mode?
1886956	1887757	They did change it.
1888158	1889880	I was not able to find non-stops though.
1890281	1892664	I heard a rumor that non-stops were in workout mode.
1893505	1894166	We couldn't find them.
1897444	1898745	Oh, maybe that's what we did wrong.
1900105	1902085	Well, I'll tell you what though, they totally changed the interface.
1902505	1905966	Like, the interface in workout mode looks better than in the in-game.
1906006	1908267	It has like the stars and the flashing red background.
1908747	1909527	Yeah, it's pretty.
1910407	1911448	It's very pretty.
1913048	1913888	No, it's pretty.
1913948	1917189	It's got the little spiral swirly thing and it makes it look cool.
1917793	1924014	I kind of like how Max 2 USA feels a little bit like a hybrid of Max 2 and Xtreme, like with all the Xtreme videos being in there and stuff.
1924694	1933936	But what's interesting is that when October 9th, we're only like two weeks away from it, we're going to be seeing the Japanese version of Xtreme, and we here at Orange Lounge Radio, of course, will be getting that.
1933976	1935617	We're going to do another launch party.
1935637	1936957	Another big promo for that one.
1937197	1940678	Yeah, but the problem is, we don't know what day we're going to get it.
1940698	1943018	You may not get it for like three weeks after it's released.
1943038	1945779	Well, we're hoping we're going to get it within days of its release.
1945839	1946219	It could be...
1949002	1949883	I'll get that later.
1964884	1969689	Yeah, Loki will get into that later, why War is on a hiatus for a little while.
1971271	1981020	DDR Extreme Japan, it's kind of like, wow, it's going to be interesting because Max 2 USA, for once, it's like it's taken a lot of the good things before the Japanese can do it.
1981841	1984142	Yeah, we actually beat them to things.
1984422	1986803	The cell shading characters, some of the songs.
1986823	1988044	Background movies.
1988544	1989264	Background movies.
1989805	1992186	Although if you heard this, this is kind of news that came out this week.
1993106	1996368	DDR Party Edition, the one that's going to come out after Extreme.
1996568	1998689	I don't know if it's the end of the year or first quarter next year.
1999409	2001892	But it's kind of going to be a Best Hits 2, basically.
2002332	2003934	But it's going to use music videos.
2004714	2005595	That could be interesting.
2005635	2009499	It's been confirmed that Conga Feelin's going to have its videos, so who knows what other videos we're going to get now.
2009519	2012162	Probably the same four we have in Max 2 USA.
2012242	2013864	Could we get Butterfly's video?
2013884	2015705	Because Butterfly has been confirmed in the mix.
2015785	2015906	Okay.
2015926	2016606	That could be interesting.
2017027	2017247	No.
2017647	2018128	Just no.
2019109	2020070	That's frightening.
2021771	2022792	And whose phone is ringing?
2022832	2023313	It's going off it.
2025177	2028058	I hear a tone.
2028658	2032439	Bad song in that mix.
2033639	2035980	Spice Girls' Wannabe is going to be in DDR Party.
2036140	2036940	You're kidding.
2037080	2038461	It has like two new songs.
2038481	2039021	You're kidding.
2039061	2041261	One of them is a beat for you song and the other one is Spice Girls.
2041281	2041441	No.
2042362	2044262	Because it's in the new Euro.
2044282	2045082	No, no, no, no, no, no.
2045102	2045942	It's in the new Euro game.
2046383	2048283	Fuck the Spice Girls.
2049103	2049924	Fuck them.
2050464	2051464	Fuck their music.
2055191	2058232	Why do they have to prolong their song's life?
2058512	2064255	And of course, people are spreading rumors that the Korean songs will finally make their debut in Party.
2064376	2065536	I doubt it too.
2065636	2066637	Never gonna happen.
2066677	2072080	Stop wanting those old pieces of shit songs.
2073440	2075381	If they were so good, they would have brought them back.
2075662	2076502	But they suck.
2076562	2077022	Get over it.
2082546	2089213	FaceSucks, I will give you that, but Bakuo and... What's the one, wherever you go, what's the slow one?
2089773	2095879	Buell, Buell, BuellSucks, but like Wah, Bakua, SongSuck, MaskTime.
2098862	2102406	Yes, one of the Sacramento regulars had a routine to be old, it was pretty cool.
2105049	2105329	Anyway...
2108390	2111651	In the chatroom, Holly is posting parody lyrics to Wannabe.
2112131	2114632	If you want to be my butter, you got to spread on my bread.
2114912	2115512	That's cute.
2115652	2116533	That's very cute.
2117793	2121374	Yeah, Tell Me Tell Me had like the funnest trick double steps ever.
2122955	2123915	I don't do trick doubles.
2123975	2124675	Thank you, Starion.
2124695	2127776	No, Bakua had the worst double steps.
2127796	2128856	Bakua had horrible double steps.
2128996	2133678	Anyway, it would be nice if those show up on Party Edition, but I'm not going to hold my breath over it.
2133958	2134638	I mean, it would be nice.
2135098	2136359	Maybe Petit Love will come back.
2136399	2136859	Oh, my God.
2138461	2141942	If that happened, I would break the game.
2141962	2146144	If Butterfly is on it, okay, then SmileDK is coming back to a home release.
2146584	2147804	Let's get Petite Love on here.
2148505	2149805	No, I don't think it'll happen.
2152146	2154547	We need bass solo songs.
2155727	2159369	So, Extreme will be out in a few weeks, and there's a couple new tracks in Extreme.
2159849	2160289	It'll be fun.
2161411	2166596	A Stupid Barber A Stupid Barber has been confirmed What the hell is that song?
2166736	2175283	It's by Soda It's by the same one who did one of the songs Is it Do It Right?
2175763	2180167	It's also one of the songs in Max 2 USA What?
2180187	2180267	What?
2182858	2183779	Show T?
2184900	2185240	Yeah.
2185540	2187562	It's one of the Hidden Max 2 USA songs, too.
2187582	2188402	I just can't think of the name.
2188422	2189343	I'm looking it up right now.
2189663	2190203	I Need You.
2190564	2190964	That one.
2191224	2192305	I Need You was by him, too.
2192325	2195287	With the piano in the background?
2196768	2196868	Oh.
2198883	2199544	Oh, that one.
2200425	2201006	Right, whatever.
2202628	2206773	So, um... Okay, so what's this you're going to play for us, Loki?
2207594	2211939	This is the track that was in the lesson mode in X2.
2211999	2213741	I think... I heard it be called Overloaded.
2213801	2214522	Alright, let's hear it.
2317752	2322296	All right, that is Lesson 2, we're calling it for now.
2322917	2325099	It might be overloaded because that's the one lyric in it.
2325439	2328262	But that is Lesson 2 in Max 2 USA.
2328302	2329803	And it fucking rules.
2330744	2331365	It's awesome.
2331585	2333407	And what if that's a stupid barber?
2335168	2336710	That would be, no, just no.
2337030	2338071	I doubt it, but that would be cool.
2340151	2341231	Well, here's the other thing, though.
2341392	2342932	It's one of the things we can look at.
2343653	2354217	Since, pretty much, you can guarantee Extreme, the Party Mix, Max 2 USA, and Dancing Stage Fever are... Whatever their one is going to be called now.
2354237	2356578	I don't know if it's Fever or not, but anyways.
2356738	2360760	They're all sharing the same song list that was in Max 2.
2361120	2367763	So you pretty much eliminate all the songs that have been confirmed for the other games, and you're left with what's in Extreme, which one of them is Max, period.
2369104	2369945	Another Max?
2370265	2370866	Max period.
2371046	2385018	The problem is if that appears in DDR Extreme, it's going to be pretty much guaranteed that that's going to be DDR Extreme was the last arcade version because they never release Maxes on the home versions at all.
2385199	2386520	So that would be my guess.
2389763	2394325	I'm going to go out on a limb here, and I know Loki's going to yell at me for it, but I think Max Period is a red herring.
2394345	2395165	I don't think it means anything.
2395726	2397667	I think it'll be nothing.
2397847	2399307	I don't think it's going to be a song.
2399827	2401648	But I would love to be proven wrong.
2404870	2405550	Mine didn't break.
2407131	2408751	I don't even remember when it broke.
2409191	2410932	Maybe that song was Max Period.
2410972	2411593	Oh my gods.
2412613	2416034	I'm going to move your jacket right here.
2419244	2420665	Okay, we're going to take a break.
2420685	2422387	We're going to play some more Max 2 USA stuff.
2422407	2426591	When we come back, we're going to finish up any talk on Max 2 USA.
2426611	2431115	We're going to talk a bit about some other games and some other arcades in town.
2431135	2433617	We're going to talk about 2DX as well when we come back.
2434057	2439242	After this group of Max 2 USA MP3s, we're going to hear in this break, start off with Days Go By.
2439282	2441304	And you're going to hear Forever Sunshine in this break too.
2441324	2441364	No!
2442046	2443286	No, God no.
2443747	2449129	It's only a minute and 28 seconds, but I feel an obligation to our listeners who haven't been able to hear it yet.
2449809	2451249	They can say they've heard it, so here it is.
2451569	2453390	Do you really want to scare the crap out of them?
2453430	2456711	That's okay, because after that we get one of the coolest 70 songs ever, Get Down Tonight.
2458032	2458952	Do a little dance.
2459132	2459692	You know what?
2460493	2460953	You know what?
2461033	2467235	People don't need to buy laxatives anymore, because all they have to do is listen to that Sunshine song, and it'll make them poop.
2468958	2471161	and Forever Sunshine.
2472502	2473463	I love you.
2473704	2474364	Listen, Frog.
2475205	2477307	Now, is that song worse than Let Them Move?
2478829	2480190	Is that song worse than Let Them Move?
2480651	2481432	We will find out.
2481512	2483074	We will find out after the break.
2484115	2485156	We should make the chatroom vote.
2546095	2549168	Days when I couldn't live my life without you
2753850	2756879	Orange Lounge Radio With the Ping Pong Boys
2762375	2767876	All right, welcome back, boys and girls, to Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 62, playing Max 2 USA MP3s all night tonight.
2767936	2777079	In that break, you heard Dirty Vegas, Days Go By, Shell Y with Forever Sunshine, and Miss Piggy, and KC and the Sunshine Band with Get Down Tonight.
2777279	2779219	Okay, I have to make a comment on the chat room.
2779299	2779539	Yes.
2779579	2785801	For your response to Biohazard, don't diss fucking KC and the Sunshine Band.
2785841	2789862	You are... That is the best fucking song ever.
2792312	2793752	You know what, though?
2794533	2796694	I do have to agree with half of what he says.
2796734	2800475	I think Let's Groove is funner to dance to, and funner is a word, yes.
2800956	2801636	Gotcha, though?
2801816	2802436	Can't stand it.
2802636	2803857	Can't stand Gotcha.
2805478	2808319	I cannot stand dancing to that song.
2809640	2811941	Before we went to the break, we said we were going to settle a debate.
2811961	2812661	Which song is worse?
2816556	2818357	Forever Sunshine, or Let Them Move?
2818877	2824198	The chat room has voted, and I will reveal what they have voted, which one is worse, but I just want to hear what you guys think, and why.
2825278	2826499	Aaron, we haven't heard much from you tonight.
2826539	2828959	Which song's worse, Let Them Move or Forever Sunshine?
2829820	2831440	I guess you guys should know my opinion on this.
2831660	2832520	I did freestyle.
2836209	2838691	Well, I did freestyle to let them move.
2840231	2841472	And we all know how that turned out.
2842533	2845855	But I guess I could say Forever Sunshine is kind of weird.
2846936	2847616	But is it worse?
2849037	2849597	Oh, okay.
2849697	2851999	So Aaron says Forever Sunshine is a little worse.
2852759	2853600	Just a little, though.
2853800	2855842	Better close.
2856302	2858284	Puppy, which one's worse and why?
2859365	2863408	Fred or Sunshine, just because it's... I can stand Let Them Move.
2864509	2868973	If I turn the volume down a little bit, but... No, this song is just... Ew.
2870854	2872676	Jamie, which is worse and why?
2873396	2876879	After dealing with Let Them Move for three and a half, nearly four years?
2878000	2878320	Uh-uh.
2878601	2879822	Let Them Move is still the worst.
2880749	2881710	www.DarkSakura.com
2900706	2902967	Bradley, which song is worse than why?
2903708	2904608	Let Them Move is worse.
2905108	2909711	Because this woman in this song can actually sing alright, even if she sings weird.
2910091	2911451	But in Let Them Move, she just screeches.
2911471	2916514	Which makes it much worse.
2918455	2920196	So, that's it.
2920836	2922157	Loki, which song is worse than why?
2922377	2925739	I think they need to do Let Them Move Ska, which would be pretty cool.
2926879	2928240	Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.
2929076	2932438	Let them move, let them move, sweet, sweet baby.
2932758	2933779	They could totally do it.
2933799	2939742	They could, like, you know, I don't know, get, um, I don't know, get some ska band to do it.
2939802	2948407	I mean, there's plenty of... Get Tom, or was it, um, Mr. Brian in the final band?
2949167	2949948	Get him to do that.
2950008	2952109	Oh, yeah, we should have put Crash in there, too, but that's all right.
2952209	2953050	That wasn't an option.
2953070	2954070	So, what's your answer?
2955391	2955531	Um...
2957924	2959506	I dislike them equally.
2960607	2967073	No, honestly, I hate Forever Sunshine because it's happy, and I don't like happy.
2967854	2977943	And it's happy like Poppy, like, look, the sun is smiling, the clouds are smiling, the little furry animals are smiling, everybody is smiling happy, happy.
2979044	2981606	to Scream Scream Badly.
2981786	2984788	Yeah, I just... All right.
2986610	2994555	Me, personally, as much as... Now, I can impersonate Muppets to both of them because I can do Miss Piggy with Forever Sunshine, but with Let Them Move, I can also do Elmo loves Para Para.
2994615	2995396	Let them move.
2995696	2997197	Let them move.
2998018	2998798	Sweet, sweet.
2999239	2999459	But...
3002543	3004864	Let Them Move is by far worse.
3005084	3008566	I love imitating Miss Piggy more than I do Elmo, so Forever Sunshine is way worse.
3009086	3010427	I mean, Let Them Move is way worse.
3010447	3011228	Forever Sunshine is better.
3011828	3015830	I actually somewhat enjoy Forever Sunshine in a campy musical sort of way.
3016951	3018591	All right, so I think it was even.
3018631	3020893	We had Loki, Bradley, and me said Let Them Move.
3020933	3023454	No, because Jamie also said Let Them Move is worse.
3023514	3025915	It was four, and then you two said Forever Sunshine.
3025935	3027716	What do you guys think the chat room said?
3028437	3029177	Let Them Move.
3030043	3036065	By an overwhelming majority, well, mostly overwhelming, the chatroom says Let Them Move is the worst song.
3036105	3037625	So, there you go.
3037645	3038525	That's the way you guys voted.
3038545	3041606	I don't think it matters because it's still banned from the station.
3042627	3044027	Let Them Move is banned from the station.
3044127	3045327	I don't know about Forever Sunshine, though.
3045347	3046988	I don't know if I put that in or not today.
3047048	3049328	I put a bunch of new Max 2 USA MP3s in today.
3049368	3050949	I don't know if Forever Sunshine is one of them or not.
3051669	3053930	Thank you, ViolentHyperBurpGirl.
3053970	3055030	That was impressive.
3055737	3057598	Hey, it was a double.
3058799	3061560	Let's get into 2DX news and speaking of bad songs.
3061801	3065683	You know, the Night Style soundtrack came out like just a week ago, pretty much.
3066263	3069745	And I have to admit something, and this is hard, this is painful.
3069805	3070926	I need to sit down for this.
3072387	3079711	And you know, the last time I sat down to admit something, I was admitting that I like Paula Terry's version of Dive.
3079871	3081312	So you know that this is bad, okay?
3081332	3082253	Okay.
3083013	3086676	There was a song that I was somewhat surprised to see on the Night Style soundtrack.
3086716	3089198	And I forgot that this song was in Night Style.
3089238	3098385	But when I was listening to this song, I realized that in the context of 2DX, I actually kind of like this song.
3098505	3102908	And that song is... Don't say it!
3103169	3103869	Don't say it!
3104249	3106091	Stop kind of like bag...
3108126	3109226	You fag!
3109246	3110447	I'm sorry!
3111628	3112748	I'm so sorry.
3114049	3115650	But I like bag.
3115670	3120113	I apologize to my mommy.
3121734	3122875	Jamie likes bag too?
3123015	3125456	It'll only be good when it gets remixed by 2MB.
3125697	3127378	Where the hell has 2MB been?
3127938	3128478	Seriously.
3128798	3129939	He's just like, yeah.
3131680	3133361	That personality, der.
3133401	3133561	Okay.
3134022	3134242	Okay.
3135209	3136750	Where has 2MB been?
3136790	3140051	I mean, seriously, it's just like, after 5th Mix, I quit, you know?
3140071	3149215	We need to get 2MB here to take all those shitty songs that Naoki, the other personality, keeps making and re- No, wait, 2MB is not Naoki.
3149895	3150436	I thought it was.
3151016	3153477	No, it's- it's you and the- Ah, whatever.
3153497	3153777	Ha!
3154457	3155318	You tricked me!
3157665	3158325	How dare I?
3158906	3160627	Yeah, we need to get him back to, like, fix.
3160827	3162708	I absolutely agree with Brack2000.
3163309	3165190	He says, Bag is bad for DDR.
3165570	3166971	That's why I hated Bag before.
3167031	3168572	It is an acid song to dance to.
3168592	3170153	Bag should have been in Parapara.
3170333	3171174	It was not fun at all.
3171494	3176037	But Bag in 2DX would actually be kind of fun.
3176077	3179159	I haven't played it in 2DX yet, but I think I'd actually enjoy it.
3179239	3182421	So I found that on the Nightstyle OST, I actually enjoy Bag.
3185270	3186392	Sorry, Loki!
3186873	3189780	It's the truth, and I believe in telling the truth on this show.
3190983	3191303	Whatever.
3192128	3194050	Also on the Nightstyle soundtrack, there's some great stuff.
3194410	3195871	A long version of Golden Horn.
3196272	3196612	Awesome.
3197032	3199074	A long version of The End of My Spiritually.
3199294	3200195	And that's not a typo.
3200235	3201216	It's not spirituality.
3201256	3202997	It's The End of My Spiritually, if you listen to the lyrics.
3203638	3204118	That's great.
3204739	3207681	And yes, I agree in the chat room.
3207701	3211724	It's scrolled off the screen, but Logic Board is awesome.
3211824	3212405	I love that song.
3213426	3218730	And I agree with Jamie when she says, more men with nice asses need to dance to bag and wear a kilt.
3219231	3220812	And would that be a military-style kilt?
3221312	3222073	Full traditional.
3224655	3226897	Okay.
3226957	3229239	How does Sweetest Savage sound?
3229279	3229760	Pretty nice.
3230040	3230460	Pretty good.
3230941	3233823	That's the other athletics one, right?
3234283	3234804	That's what I thought.
3234844	3235444	Yeah, it's pretty good.
3236866	3242911	It's interesting because when you hear things on the Nightstyle OST, it sounds a lot different than those MP3s that were leaked before.
3243752	3245253	Please Don't Go needs to be in DDR.
3246374	3248675	Imagine how fun that would be on the little scratchy parts.
3249475	3254739	See, why can't they take songs from 2DX like Please Don't Go and put those into Max 2 USA?
3254879	3258521	Instead, oh my god, VJ Army would kick so much ass in DDR.
3258781	3263244	Why don't they take those instead and put them in instead of repeating fucking Put Your Faith In Me?
3264372	3269795	And what I don't get is, they're like, you know, in-house music, so why... I mean... I know.
3269915	3273197	Pay your artists their little, like, peanut or whatever in there.
3273337	3279621	Dancer X broke it down on DDR Freak the reasons why, and he was basically like, you know, you can have the repeats or you can have nothing or something like that.
3279661	3285364	But I'm like, you know what, I'm sorry, I respect their decision or whatever, but I don't agree with it.
3285404	3287445	I think they could have taken more 2DX songs.
3288346	3290287	I don't know what they're saving it for, because...
3291247	3295629	as, you know, it's going to take another year before we see Max 3 or Extreme in the U.S., whatever it is.
3297730	3299510	If we even see it at all, they may not do one.
3299530	3302671	Why is it that, like, you can have... And by then we're on 9th and 10th style.
3302711	3303572	No, no, no, no.
3303672	3306053	Why is it that you can have, like, a person, like, say...
3307433	3308193	Oh, I don't know.
3309214	3316396	Healing, this guy goes by the name Healing Vision, or a guy that goes by the name Utter Dude, or the guy, you know, this Matt, I forget his last name.
3316776	3321778	Why can they pump out really quality, and this is talking about better than, you know, home version.
3322658	3323740	www.DarkSakura.com
3340160	3341161	I'm going to catch you on something.
3341741	3344943	Rumor is, it has not been confirmed that KOA actually did those steps.
3345063	3349686	Rumor is that KOJ might have done quite a few of them, especially the things that are going to show up in Extreme later.
3349706	3351227	Oh, that's even worse!
3351567	3356410	But I'm just saying, the same people who've done all the steps before are probably still doing them for DDRMAX 2 USA.
3356450	3358671	It has not been confirmed that KOA has been doing them in-house.
3361117	3370464	You have to notice that a lot of the new original songs in Max 2 kind of get stuck with a lot of fucking freeze arrows, and you remember what happened in Max 1 with that.
3371144	3372345	Hi, here's my suggestion.
3372385	3378610	Dear Konami, when you're going to put out Max 3 or Extreme or whatever the next thing is that's going to come out in the US, there better be something else.
3379711	3380852	Please have an edit bank.
3382785	3385886	Yeah, seriously, go with the databank just like last time.
3385986	3389047	This is what you need to link up to the old mixes.
3389467	3394089	Fuck this repeating put-your-faith-in-me stuff just because the damn song was in Konomics.
3394449	3401871	Bring up an edit bank that has steps to songs like Dark Black Forest, Japan, things that were in earlier mixes, and there you go.
3402191	3405152	Now people have a reason to get those old mixes because they want to see the databank.
3405192	3408713	And not only that, here's a few other things you can do.
3409934	3411214	Put in challenge mode.
3412006	3412867	Challenge mode back.
3413187	3415929	But instead, set it up like drill mode.
3416009	3420072	Not just challenge mode, I want a story mode to go with it, written by Jason Enos.
3420692	3422393	Okay, that's retarded.
3422413	3426456	We do not need a story mode because then we'd be going back to one of the worst Konami games ever.
3426797	3427797	Dance, dance, dance.
3428878	3430739	With a little stupid RPG mode in it.
3431000	3431740	Ugh, that game sucked.
3431900	3432701	Dance, dance, dance.
3436792	3438473	Dance, Dance, Dance started the Bimani thing.
3438513	3439873	It did not begin with Beatmania.
3439953	3445476	The style of game came with Beatmania, but the whole music game thing started with Dance, Dance, Dance, and the game flows.
3446056	3456821	Anyways, yeah, challenge mode for sure, but set up like drill mode, because in that way you can have drill mode as being both a training lesson mode thing and a challenge mode at the same time.
3457922	3458923	And drill modes are fun.
3458963	3461827	I mean, it takes you a long time to go through and you can incorporate that.
3462248	3463149	That and the unlocks.
3463349	3467114	Don't make a song get unlocked after ten songs.
3467354	3473483	Seriously, we play like a full two sets of songs, you know, five songs each, and we get an unlock.
3474063	3474784	That's recorded.
3474984	3479708	But what do you say to the people that disagree with you and say, you know what, fuck the unlocks, just have it all to begin with.
3479848	3481450	Why do we even waste our time unlocking things?
3481470	3482911	Just blow your load in the beginning.
3483011	3485753	Because there's no point in playing the game then if you have no purpose to play the game.
3485973	3488015	Well, what about playing the songs and dancing to them?
3488035	3488776	That's what you do in DDR.
3488816	3489757	You have to have a goal.
3489857	3491178	It's going to get boring faster.
3492559	3493060	What would you think?
3493080	3499065	Now, I think, but we know this is never going to happen because Konami of America is not going to put out an arcade machine, but let's say KOJ does this.
3499779	3504483	An F-Zero type unlock system where you have to go back and forth between the arcade and the home version to unlock things.
3505284	3506825	It would be cool, but it'll never work.
3508506	3510348	Because they'll never make an arcade version.
3514972	3515292	Anyway.
3518151	3522954	We'd be interested in your suggestions as well for Max 3 USA or Extreme, whatever it's called.
3522994	3524275	Oh, let's just put it this way.
3524315	3526616	www.caliabomani.com, click on Orange Lounge and click on Chat.
3526916	3534581	Once I get the freaking cabinet done in here, and you see how I have the sim set up with all the songs, and there's going to be unlocks in there.
3535535	3539019	This is how the damn game should be, like my home cabinet.
3539480	3543764	We're going to have quality songs in there because I don't pay licensing rights to anyone.
3545186	3547869	You should make multiple machines and then sell them.
3548670	3550232	You should go suck my cock.
3558837	3560439	Okay, what time is it?
3560479	3562201	We need to record the time.
3562561	3563763	NoStylin has a great one.
3564183	3568228	He says the unlock should be nude images of Konami staff.
3568448	3569069	Ah, just kidding.
3569089	3569930	Jason Enos.
3573499	3577663	No, but there's, okay, there's a lot of stuff.
3580186	3583329	Let's talk about some of the other stuff that's also that they could have done.
3583870	3587834	Another thing I came up with a while back was routine videos.
3587894	3596703	Something similar to like, you know, where you have ParaPara, where you've got freestyle, which would be the standard, you know, basic trick maniac, you know, for old school people.
3597203	3605190	Um, then you've got, like, you know, routine mode, where it's another set of steps, but it goes with, like, a dancing character on screen where you do what they do, and it kind of goes with that.
3605670	3608092	So, like, uh, learn how to freestyle like Mel B?
3608333	3609414	No, no, see?
3609834	3620243	See, the problem with that is that... The problem with that is that now you're going to have a bunch of little unshowered teeny-bopper idiots freestyling exactly the same routine, and that's really bad.
3620883	3624006	Um, as opposed to a bunch of stupid Asians peri-peri?
3624026	3624947	I mean, seriously!
3626215	3627916	Cara is dead, okay?
3629297	3633219	It was cool until they made the videos and put it on the machine.
3634339	3645845	I would be fine with Konami doing a learn how to freestyle like us thing as long as, and I preface this with a disclaimer, views and opinions expressed by me do not express those that weren't on the video, as long as it's not 8-Ball.
3650964	3652325	You know, I can't make a comment.
3652446	3653767	I cannot make a comment.
3654048	3655770	We'll take your silence as your comment.
3657712	3661136	Well, I still have stuff to say about that idea for freestyling.
3661236	3662718	I mean, then they're all going to...
3663171	3664352	DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com
3682628	3686690	Okay, it's better than, um, so basically it's gonna be based off of that routine there.
3686850	3690612	Gee, like, no one bases their routines off of, like, music videos or anything.
3690932	3692312	No one emulates anybody.
3692352	3693353	They're all original.
3694814	3698055	Then again, do you really want people just imitating the home versions?
3699596	3706799	It's better than watching people hump the bar, jump over the bar, run across the screen, hand slap, knee drop, and act like idiots.
3707737	3711299	No, I don't mind people jumping over the bar for the few times that they miss and nut themselves.
3711519	3727650	Okay, well that's fine, but other than that though, well other than freestyle mode or whatever that would be, my other idea was, now StepMedia has kind of done this, they have a mode in it called Mines, which is kind of neat.
3727970	3735835	There's steps that go up, like arrows and stuff, normal, whatever, I don't know if it's randomly generated or whatever, but there's also steps that you can't step on.
3736315	3737936	If you step on them, you lose health.
3738076	3739017	This is what I've been saying.
3739157	3742239	If DDR is going to come back in Japan, it needs to be competitive.
3742259	3743959	I've said this like five out of the last ten shows.
3744180	3750323	DDR needs to come back competitive, as a competitive game, as opposed to, let's have fun and hold hands and dance and play cooperative.
3750423	3752965	Everybody dance!
3753045	3754626	And it needs to be fucking hardcore.
3757157	3764319	Or, you know, like they have Second Mix Battle, needs to be something like that in there, they need something like Dance Magic, they need just anything that's competitive.
3764359	3769961	I want, I want at the very end of each battle round, there'd be smoke coming out of the middle of the city, and strobe lights!
3770361	3772321	Strobe lights, lots of strobe lights.
3773322	3777923	Exactly, I want, I want Unison, I want all that shit back.
3778603	3780904	I want Second Mix version Dance Battle.
3782136	3786459	DDR has gotten fucking tame as it's been going along, and it's time for DDR to get mean.
3788020	3790402	Do you know how easy tournaments would be?
3790642	3792483	You know how easy and common tournaments would be?
3794825	3797767	They should have tournament mode, where it's just already set up in the cabinet.
3800228	3802590	But, uh, yeah.
3802950	3803831	What else could they have?
3806061	3811063	Well, definitely like some new sort of unlocks, you know.
3812444	3815585	I liked kind of like Max USA's unlocks.
3816265	3816946	It was weird.
3817146	3820787	Yeah, where you could get it by doing the songs.
3821067	3822348	You had to do a lot more songs.
3822368	3824649	You had to do 500 songs to get Drop the Bomb.
3824729	3825669	That was worth it.
3825949	3829091	But you could do other little stupid things to get them, too.
3829131	3829451	You're right.
3829491	3833673	They need to find a happy medium between Max USA and Max 2 USA.
3834993	3844882	Because Max would say, I got tired of playing like 500 songs to get the next unlock, but I also got tired of playing just 10 songs and getting the unlocks super fast.
3845202	3849666	So they need to kind of balance it out in the middle there somewhere, and that'd be kind of cool.
3850166	3858173	It's funny because when Marin in the chatroom says, Get mean, DDR, runs around biting people, rawr, it makes me think, if they want DDR to get good, just inject a little SARS into it.
3858553	3859014	Rawr!
3860576	3861057	Rage.
3862560	3863481	Induce rage.
3863501	3865625	DDR Rabid Wolf Mix.
3869085	3870366	Okay, I think we're going to take a quick break.
3870386	3871086	We're going to do some more.
3871146	3872127	Ooh, ooh, ooh.
3872287	3873587	Here's a really great idea.
3873887	3878770	Have a song similar to, I think it was in Space, no, not Space Shelf 5.
3878890	3883532	It was in that Buster Move game or whatever that we were playing a while back.
3883572	3884133	Dance Summit?
3884213	3884793	Dance Summit.
3885153	3889856	Where if you do good in a song or do perfect or whatever, that the song changes.
3891016	3892517	Like it kind of remixes itself.
3892557	3893397	That would be kind of weird.
3894078	3894558	But it would be cool.
3895649	3896229	All right, I'm done.
3896730	3898291	Okay, we're going to take a quick break.
3898331	3900412	In this break, we're going to hear Heaven.
3900632	3906296	This is a big one because this was the number one requested licensed song, Please Get It, and Konami did it.
3906516	3907176	They got Heaven.
3907617	3915442	We're going to hear the mix of that that's in DDR Max 2 USA, and then we're also going to hear I Need You, which is one of the songs, is a Konami original that has not been in DDR or any Bomani game before.
3916082	3920305	And then we'll also hear Keep On Lifton, that song from Beatmania 3 that made it into Max 2 USA.
3920845	3921646	When we come back...
3922367	3926511	Since we haven't gotten around to it yet, we usually kick off the show with it, but a lot of people have some stories they want to tell.
3926551	3928733	We're going to get into how was your day, how was your week when we come back.
3931255	3941824	Baby, you're all that I want When you're lying here in my arms I'm finding it hard to believe We're in heaven
4068567	4068809	Thank you.
4129014	4129734	Uh, yeah.
4130715	4131455	And you don't stop.
4132476	4132876	Come on.
4193524	4194165	Thanks for watching!
4226245	4231541	Rock Over London, Rock Over Chicago, Orange Lounge Radio It's a good place to listen to the music
4234440	4237281	Makes me sad, Wesley Willis, dead and gone.
4237682	4238082	I cry.
4239302	4248547	Alright, as promised, now's the part of the show where we go around and talk to our guests and we talk about how was your week and how was your day.
4248587	4250548	And I know some people have some exciting things to talk about.
4250568	4254810	I, for one, I want to talk about, well, we'll get to that when we get to me.
4255130	4256111	Who wants to start tonight?
4257151	4257991	You always do, Jamie?
4258011	4258452	Go for it.
4258892	4260993	I didn't know you always did, but fine, do it.
4263354	4264735	Jamie's shoving a peanut in her mouth.
4265316	4266777	What if other people want to go first today?
4267017	4268298	What if other people want to go first today?
4269239	4270540	Screw them.
4272922	4275804	My week has been okay.
4276905	4278106	I've been sleep deprived all week.
4278126	4279968	I haven't gotten more than four hours of sleep a night.
4281329	4283791	So I crashed really bad on Friday night.
4284251	4285432	I stayed up as late as I could.
4285452	4286633	I was supposed to play Phantasy Star.
4287173	4287333	Uh-uh.
4288735	4290976	I barely had enough of an attention span for Ragnarok.
4292378	4292678	So, uh,
4293553	4295253	I passed out like at 2 a.m.
4295933	4298954	Got up at 11.30ish, something like that.
4299734	4304335	I went out and hung out with Iguana Girl all weekend, well, all Saturday.
4305095	4307396	And we bought iguana food for Moo.
4308776	4316397	And watched, like, Life of Brian and Jay and Silent Bob back-to-back while cutting up greens.
4316417	4317117	My fingers turned green.
4318197	4319618	It was scary.
4319918	4320898	I played DDR Thursday.
4322176	4327580	Oh my gosh, okay, you have to realize the past like three weeks, I go here, Jamie, do you have anything Bomani related you want to tell us?
4327940	4328240	No.
4329941	4342629	You made an interesting live journal entry, and I know you keep your live journal friends only, but maybe this is one you wouldn't mind sharing, kind of about what you were saying about... 40 minutes of DDR is 306 calories burned.
4343329	4347252	And that's just like, you know, on the medium mode on workout, on workout mode.
4348411	4349692	on the old Max.
4350993	4351413	Max USA 1.
4351453	4353375	Yeah, because that was before I got my Max 2.
4354656	4355296	And you know what?
4355376	4356117	It was pretty fun.
4357318	4358699	I was really tired and everything.
4359159	4360841	Yeah, this was Thursday.
4363103	4363603	No, take that back.
4363643	4364203	It wasn't Thursday.
4364223	4364724	It was Wednesday.
4365845	4366365	Something like that.
4366766	4367987	But anyway, it was...
4369326	4374147	I was still really tired, and I've been so tired all week that I really haven't been able to put much more effort into it.
4374667	4380169	But, you know, that's how, when I first started playing DDR, I played for an hour every night.
4380489	4381529	I mean, more than an hour.
4381629	4384270	I would do like two hours of nothing but not stopping on second mix.
4385650	4387451	And I'm thinking that that's what I'm going to do again.
4387991	4389191	You know, better living through DDR.
4389733	4393415	Seriously, I'm going to lose weight if I play more DDR.
4393776	4394656	I'll lose weight again.
4394716	4399539	So I'm going to get back into playing and mixing that with going to the gym.
4400240	4405583	And Saturday, I got milk tea and boiled peanuts.
4406664	4417891	And I don't know how many people know anything about living in the South, but I haven't, for years, I haven't been able to find boiled peanuts until I moved out here.
4419036	4421177	And so I started shopping at the Asian food stores.
4422037	4423418	So I was like, boiled peanuts.
4424078	4425838	And they were, you know, fresh boiled peanuts and everything.
4425858	4426379	They were really good.
4428159	4436242	And anyway, I got some goodies.
4436262	4437222	I have lots of them at home.
4438243	4439443	Picked up some treats for people.
4441764	4445565	But boiled peanuts, that was like the highlight of my weekend was boiled peanuts.
4448078	4448638	I never get them.
4449058	4451499	The one thing that I wish I could find is blood peanuts in a can.
4452580	4455480	I've not been able to find those anywhere outside the South.
4456541	4459242	So that's been my... Yeah, and I've been busy with other stuff.
4459522	4463703	The really crappy drama thing seems to have subsided, which I'm pretty glad for.
4465264	4465944	There was drama?
4467316	4473277	There was drama involving a site, but it's pretty much resolved.
4473677	4478479	I've just been feeling really crappy all week, you know, in general, but it hasn't been a bad week.
4479639	4483680	So, and they can't hear any of your commentary because you're busy sucking nuts.
4487441	4488981	The look on your face is great.
4491101	4491962	My nuts are good.
4492062	4493102	They're safe for consumption.
4495997	4496297	Anyway.
4496557	4496897	You're done?
4497797	4498358	Geez!
4498378	4500718	No, I'm just saying, are you done?
4500778	4501158	Yeah.
4501758	4502599	Are you done?
4502879	4506699	Aaron's got her hand out, so... Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob.
4506739	4507380	What?
4507740	4507980	Rob.
4508420	4508680	What?
4508960	4509260	Rob.
4509440	4509660	What?
4510080	4510300	Rob.
4510560	4510820	What?
4511160	4511360	Hi.
4511721	4511921	Hi.
4513241	4515081	Aaron, how was your week?
4515101	4515661	How was your day?
4516281	4521863	Alright, well, for those of you who know, X and I sent, aka Claudia, has officially got me addicted to Initial D!
4521883	4522703	Boo!
4522723	4522803	Boo!
4523573	4524134	Damn her.
4524774	4525375	Just kidding.
4525715	4529758	Yeah, I spent a total of at least $10 on the game.
4529778	4535263	Because it's only like 40 cents at the MU to play.
4535944	4538326	And it's five tokens to a dollar.
4538466	4540548	So two tokens per game.
4540748	4541849	So yeah, five games for $2.
4541889	4542129	Good shit.
4545206	4553370	Also, I started school this week, and workload 57, English 57, which is a stupid little remedial English class, feels just like high school!
4554531	4555151	Unfortunately.
4555531	4556452	So I'm stuck there.
4556992	4557652	For a quarter.
4558893	4559253	And yeah.
4559573	4562495	I have to interject real fast, because the chatroom won't shut up about this.
4562795	4567297	Chatroom, I assure you, we will play Overloaded in the afterbirth again, okay?
4568057	4568517	There you go.
4569038	4569318	Alright.
4569598	4571159	Sorry, ViolentHyperGirl, go ahead.
4571479	4573620	And Holly says, can I have your salty nuts?
4575309	4575950	Uh, sure.
4576370	4577951	Anyway, sorry to interrupt.
4577971	4578552	Do you want to finish?
4578572	4579272	Well, yeah.
4579753	4582475	I actually didn't get lost on campus for my first day of school.
4582675	4583115	Woohoo!
4584216	4588620	And I've also become quite popular in the dorms after playing piano so many times.
4589180	4591162	Oh, you're already popular in the dorms, huh?
4591262	4593143	Hey!
4593203	4594024	Not that way!
4597155	4600517	But yeah, other than that, we kind of settled in.
4600637	4602158	Our apartment's cooled down considerably.
4602218	4606819	Davis has only been hitting upwards of, at best, 90 this past week.
4608000	4608960	Yeah, it's been pretty good.
4611381	4612102	And let's see.
4612742	4613642	Anything special today?
4614683	4619925	No, not really, other than it's good to be on Orange Lounge when there's no internet problems.
4620376	4622937	Yeah, it's nice to be here on a week where the station works, huh?
4623518	4626439	For those of you that missed last week, you're better off, okay?
4626519	4627159	Just trust us.
4628120	4628600	We wrote it off.
4628880	4629421	You know what, though?
4629461	4634503	You know what's interesting about last week's show, and I didn't realize this until I was going back and clipping it down for the archives?
4634723	4634983	What?
4635444	4638445	We did not take a single break last week at all.
4638465	4639406	Yeah, you didn't notice that?
4639446	4639706	We never...
4640663	4642265	I didn't notice that we did two hours straight.
4642525	4650033	So if you think about it, even though a lot of people were kind of like, oh, you guys only did two hours, you know, with all the problems, even though we dropped you guys 37 times thanks to Comcast.
4651114	4657561	If you think about it, with two hours straight of content, you know, throw breaks, you didn't lose that much of a show, so shut up.
4658682	4659723	That's my point, shut up.
4660359	4660939	Yeah, alright.
4661660	4664842	Let's see, other than that, I've actually had my room to myself.
4664883	4667324	I'm supposed to be sharing my room with my friend, but she hasn't been home.
4667745	4668185	Lucky you.
4668485	4669786	Oh, does she have a boyfriend?
4669966	4671428	Yeah, she's been spending... See, there you go.
4671668	4677772	That's what always happens in college, is that, you know, my roommate was the same way indoors, that he was rushing a fraternity, so he was sleeping with all his boyfriends.
4680435	4683497	And we all probably know what he was doing with all of them.
4684640	4692246	Actually, no, he also had a girlfriend that lived upstairs and he was staying there sometimes because the one time she came to stay there, I had a fit, okay?
4692386	4698690	I was just like, I don't feel comfortable with her being here in the morning when I'm waking up.
4698730	4700752	I'm just like, that's weird.
4701972	4702193	Yeah.
4703213	4705635	But yeah, okay, so anyone else want to talk about their week?
4705995	4706656	Okay, so you're done.
4707336	4709137	Bradley, you have anything you want to share about your week and your day?
4711419	4711959	How was your week?
4711999	4712800	How was your day, Bradley?
4713601	4713921	Hold on.
4714910	4715991	It's caught on the other one.
4718594	4719314	Take it away.
4720555	4721156	Okay.
4722457	4723218	Unchlorial.
4724839	4726861	I didn't do all that much this week.
4727021	4733107	I... Every so often... Most of it was being lazy for most of the day.
4733667	4734388	Punctuated by...
4735589	4736110	Thanks for watching.
4736130	4736651	See you next time.
4752313	4758877	Hello, if you're out there and you want to hire somebody, Arcadian42, Bradley, hire him.
4760759	4763921	Well, most of it's because I'm stupid and it took too long to do stuff.
4764381	4765922	Anyway, and let's see, what else?
4766002	4767123	Anything else I did this week?
4768744	4769724	What else might I have done?
4772751	4774332	Actually, I don't think I went anywhere any time this week.
4774513	4777956	Except for Wednesday, I came over here and played some DDR Max 2.
4779097	4780558	Since I only have the Japanese version.
4780618	4784041	I don't have a US PS2, so I got to experience that.
4784281	4784622	Oh, good.
4784722	4785002	Good deal.
4786010	4789171	He went to... He went away.
4789771	4791412	Went far, far away.
4792433	4793373	To get power.
4794593	4795254	Staying in.
4796234	4796674	There he is.
4796834	4798235	I should have made him get me something too.
4798315	4800756	I should have sent him a shopping list.
4800796	4801316	Yeah, go back!
4801336	4804637	I didn't go anywhere yesterday.
4804897	4805878	I thought I went somewhere yesterday.
4805898	4807658	Oh, crap.
4807998	4808879	Now I can't remember where I went.
4809439	4810619	I think I might have went to Walmart.
4810900	4811680	Actually, I went to Walmart today.
4814013	4815214	Damn, I'm so forgettable.
4815234	4816815	I can do one thing and I forget what I did.
4818376	4823359	Oh, actually I went to the post office to mail stuff I sold off.
4825080	4833344	And then today I watched the debate from Wednesday for the governor's debate.
4834285	4835085	Them being silly.
4835426	4840909	Yeah, it was sort of okay, not all that great of a debate.
4842262	4844444	Arnold didn't really impress me all that much.
4845645	4850930	He was more impressed by when he was on, what's his face, Larry King.
4851570	4857055	He was a bit more... No, no, he was on Larry King like two weeks ago.
4859917	4862900	And that's pretty much my week.
4865111	4865812	So exciting!
4866172	4867012	Alright, thanks for sharing.
4867033	4869875	I'm sorry you're just jumping up and down.
4869895	4874758	Alright, we'll put Puppy on the spot since he dared to leave the show.
4876019	4876880	Puppy, how was your week?
4876900	4877260	How was your day?
4877300	4877901	Traitor!
4878821	4879462	I need the other mic.
4880983	4881643	Give me the other mic.
4883625	4883705	Okay.
4883745	4883825	Okay.
4885915	4899860	Um, this week, I started classes, yay, and I spent most of my time playing this guy until I got Max 2, and then I spent all the time playing that.
4901720	4904021	Yeah, and the occasional initial D binge, too.
4905905	4918408	And then, uh, yesterday I went to Roseville to play F-Zero for, yes, for nine straight hours.
4920068	4921648	Call me an addict, I don't care.
4923009	4923489	It's true.
4923509	4927009	Was the price down to four tokens by then?
4927289	4927770	Yes, it was.
4928230	4930630	For the first two days, it was six tokens a game.
4931370	4933411	And they also didn't have the real cars until Saturday.
4933431	4933531	Yep.
4937898	4938078	Hmm.
4939639	4940839	As I finish chewing my candy.
4940959	4942479	Yeah, hello, you're on the radio, don't eat.
4942880	4943520	Whatever.
4945360	4947061	So I spent nine hours.
4948861	4950182	I played 37 games.
4950842	4951222	In a row?
4951682	4951842	No.
4953703	4954603	I knew that was coming.
4955343	4955984	I had to.
4956004	4958504	It was like the cursed number of the show.
4960105	4960565	And then, uh...
4963188	4973273	I started from scratch on a brand new card and worked my way all the way up to the highest rank possible as a master class license.
4973934	4974914	I got all the way up to that.
4975854	4981537	And I took all the records on five of the six tracks on Time Attack.
4981997	4984379	And then, yeah.
4985956	4994322	And then today I woke up at 1.30 and then sat in the apartment and then came here.
4995643	4996004	Alright.
4996824	4997064	Yeah.
4997265	4999246	Anything else you want to share?
5000207	5005151	Random non-stops have been keeping me up late at night because it's just ridiculously fun.
5006191	5011255	Even though it screws you over with things like Subaru Dark Reverse Stealth.
5013524	5018927	The one time we played it here on Wednesday when we were broadcasting, they got a really easy one.
5018947	5020288	It was like all standard songs.
5020308	5021789	It was stupid.
5021849	5023170	You haven't played it enough then.
5023650	5024090	Apparently.
5025892	5026232	Okay.
5026492	5027913	Some really fucked up things.
5028173	5030294	Loki, you have a second to tell us about your week and your day?
5030314	5031775	Yeah.
5031795	5032055	Alright.
5032776	5033616	Loki, how was your week?
5033636	5034056	How was your day?
5035974	5037735	I didn't do a whole lot.
5040258	5057655	Stopped doing LiveWire because Thursday nights only four people are listening to me and I work on it for three hours and that's not a very good mix so I'm taking time off until I feel like doing it again and then it'll be Wednesdays.
5059691	5066756	and then today I've been soldering and for some fucking reason in the last five minutes the solder gun does not want to melt the solder, period.
5067357	5068438	So I'm trying to clean the tip.
5069338	5070319	Because I think that's what's wrong.
5072000	5078265	And, um... And, uh, let's see... Well, you know what?
5078305	5081087	You should ditch your class to listen to my show, 23 Magus.
5081287	5085010	Don't fucking mention shit if it's out of your control, dumbass.
5085959	5092084	Well, if I wasn't dead with the computer and the modem, I wouldn't do it, too.
5092504	5094686	Yeah, the whole world would listen to me, too, also.
5098488	5098889	Anyways.
5103573	5104113	Uh, what else?
5104693	5109936	Um, also, today I went and shopped and got some more controllers so I can work on my pads.
5109976	5112237	I got all the wiring done on my pads, so that's kind of cool.
5112897	5116538	And, um, they should be done hopefully next week, but I don't know.
5116758	5118599	Because it's been going really slowly.
5119400	5121100	And then, um, that's it.
5121180	5121480	I'm done.
5122321	5124222	Been doing much... Oh, went and played F-Zero.
5124462	5125142	That was kind of neat.
5126643	5127143	That was about it.
5130130	5131050	I'm done.
5131130	5131470	I'm done.
5134891	5135191	Alright.
5135771	5136872	I need to talk about my week of my day.
5136912	5137732	I can't eat right now.
5138932	5139732	Alright, my week of my day.
5140392	5141373	My week is pretty good.
5142053	5143553	I saw a lot of movies this week.
5144233	5149875	I've been hanging out with Joey who's been on the show the past couple weeks and he likes to watch a lot of movies at home so I've been catching up on all these movies I didn't see.
5149895	5151715	I finally saw Resident Evil for the first time.
5152915	5154336	Which is stupid.
5156116	5161099	Also, though, on Thursday was when Roseville Golf Land finally got Max 2, and that made me as happy as a little girl.
5161760	5162060	Yes, please.
5163961	5164902	Or not Max 2.
5164982	5166322	What the hell am I talking about?
5167423	5169604	I'm torn between food and making sense.
5170045	5170925	I mean F-Zero.
5171566	5175348	Golf Land got F-Zero, and I was so excited because I've been wanting to play F-Zero in the arcade for so long.
5175728	5178069	And F-Zero in the arcade is awesome.
5178370	5179330	It is so awesome.
5179790	5181652	And I love how it links with the home version.
5181672	5183173	You can practically unlock all of...
5184173	5189135	Olive AX for your GX if you play enough in the arcade.
5189575	5195877	So after playing F-Zero a lot, and I like to play it where you ride, too, where you go move with the thing when you put the seatbelt on.
5196158	5200619	I only did that a couple times, but they have a motion machine at Roseville Golf Line, so it makes it more fun.
5200819	5205121	I don't like doing the motion on the harder courses because it's ridiculous.
5205561	5210303	Since the steering wheel itself doesn't move with the rest of the seat, it's ridiculously hard to steer.
5211323	5212404	A little bit, yeah, that's true.
5214326	5220310	I don't do it anymore, but it was fun the first couple times to go, Anyway, did you play all the courses?
5221070	5221651	I haven't played them all.
5221711	5224393	No, I've been trying to just play them in a race and try to unlock them.
5224613	5226194	I love Aeropolis.
5226374	5227435	I love the one on the home version.
5227455	5229376	It's one of my favorite tracks, so I had to play that a lot.
5229816	5231478	And then I've been playing the Outer Space one a little bit.
5231498	5233299	Green Plant is fucking crazy.
5234640	5234740	Okay.
5235400	5238902	Okay, the last course is fucking crazy, and it's like four minutes long.
5239062	5240603	Yeah, it's only one lap, isn't it?
5240803	5241403	It's three laps.
5242044	5242344	Really?
5242404	5242624	Dang.
5242644	5247727	Yeah, it's like, the average race on that course is like four and a half minutes.
5247747	5248227	That's cool.
5251611	5253172	So, F-Zero was cool.
5253252	5253812	And you know what?
5254292	5275181	It got me to go to Rozo Golf Land, and when I was able to play there, it was a Thursday night, about 8 o'clock, so there weren't a lot of kids there, and it was nice and quiet, and DDR was so loud, because not a lot of games were going, and I got to play Conga Phelan on 4th Plus, and I got to blast the shit out of it, and I had so much fun playing DDR, and I haven't had that in a long time.
5275261	5279703	So, I'm actually on good terms with Rozo Golf Land again, and I'm going to be going there more often.
5279743	5280443	It's a revival!
5280883	5281584	It's weird.
5282085	5286330	I actually, I kind of want to bring back like how we used to go there once a week.
5286650	5287812	I kind of want to bring that back.
5287892	5288893	I just don't know when.
5290114	5290415	I don't know.
5291161	5291941	Maybe Thursday nights.
5292282	5294023	And then you can warn the boss of 2DX.
5295143	5297865	Well, actually, Scandia fixed their 2DX machine.
5297905	5299065	Scandia fixed some of their stuff.
5299205	5301387	So I kind of have to share time.
5301427	5303728	Well, as of yesterday, 2DX still sucked.
5303948	5304228	Really?
5305349	5307170	I couldn't play right side very well.
5307210	5313293	I failed Deadline Light 7 because the freaking keys stuck so much.
5315839	5316620	It was ridiculous.
5318121	5326348	And then I ended up playing Left Side Auto Scratch so I could just pass songs.
5327069	5327349	Okay.
5329791	5332153	That's pretty much all I have to say about my day and my week.
5332213	5335776	I think what we're going to do, we're going to take a break.
5337088	5342715	And when we come back, we'll talk a little bit more and then we'll get into the cage match.
5343596	5345238	So you're listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

5667185	5673969	Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 62 in progress.
5674510	5678953	I'm joined tonight by my lovely co-hosts, DarkSakura and TechMassaLoki.
5679353	5682075	Also in the house, Puppy and ViolentHyperGirl.
5682615	5684477	Black Lab, and we call him Puppy.
5684517	5685798	He's not Black Lab here, he's Puppy.
5686118	5690882	Okay, yeah, it's funny when everybody starts calling me that, and then I start getting called that in person.
5690922	5692344	Oh my god, see, he has a flashing foot.
5692544	5693184	On DDR free.
5693765	5696047	Yes, I get the seizure foot.
5696067	5698069	Okay, I may not have much longer.
5698149	5698969	Arcadian 42.
5699370	5700691	Yes, I am vivid.
5703507	5703987	All right.
5704868	5706289	Anyway, we're just sitting here.
5706309	5709751	We were kind of talking about Mass 2 USA earlier, and we're playing all the songs for you guys tonight.
5710051	5716696	We have the last batch coming up the next break, which will include Will I and Tomorrow Perfume and Try To Love You.
5716716	5718757	That's probably the best batch of music coming up at the end.
5720518	5722019	One question that came up in the chat room.
5722460	5722840	Yeah, what?
5723160	5724661	How do you try to love somebody?
5724921	5726943	Doesn't it just happen like diarrhea?
5729565	5730125	Maybe like...
5730787	5731128	I don't know.
5731148	5732273	I don't even want to try and guess.
5732293	5733900	I don't get that trying thing.
5733940	5735045	You're just supposed to do it.
5736176	5736596	You know what?
5736616	5737797	Why don't you write Konami a letter?
5738097	5739457	Yeah.
5739518	5744380	We should all write one big letter to Konami about what we think they should do with DDR.
5744800	5748121	Interesting question came up in the chat room, kind of going back to Max2USA.
5748501	5749842	Favorite licensed song?
5750422	5750702	Probably.
5751923	5754464	Um... Licensed?
5754544	5755564	Favorite licensed song?
5756125	5758666	Uh... I'd have to say... No.
5759346	5759926	Max2.
5760907	5761507	Max2, yeah.
5761747	5764108	Um... Actually, I'd have to say that, um...
5765194	5766895	A little bit of ecstasy.
5767816	5771839	I thought it would be very fun for the stubs, but they actually did a really good job with it.
5772720	5776963	And it's like, the slowdown in it is like era, and it's like, whoa, shit, it's fun.
5780145	5781306	ViolentHypergirl hasn't played it yet.
5782247	5784348	Arcadian42, best licensed track.
5786630	5786930	I don't know.
5788111	5789852	Fair enough.
5789912	5790413	DarkSakura.
5792074	5792874	The one you just played.
5793789	5794591	Take me away into the night?
5794651	5794891	Yeah.
5794911	5795272	Okay.
5795613	5795953	Loki.
5799199	5801023	Let them move with the best one on there.
5803411	5803791	Let them puke.
5803811	5804152	You know what?
5831710	5832170	DarkSakura.com
5852283	5854404	She even seems to agree with you.
5854964	5855604	I love Will.
5855664	5858145	I know I saw she even put it in the chat room, which is why I said it.
5859325	5859605	I know.
5859645	5859905	Why?
5859925	5861866	Let them boobs.
5861886	5862586	Let them boobs.
5862646	5863066	Whatever.
5863126	5863646	You guys are weird.
5865167	5865967	Chat rooms are weird.
5866687	5869988	www.callybomani.com It's no silent.
5870028	5870768	Of course it's weird.
5872189	5873329	I want to bring this up real fast.
5873349	5875270	There's some interesting 2DX news that hit this week.
5875290	5877450	You guys have been wondering where 2DX7 style is?
5878210	5879751	Do you guys want to know when...
5880600	5882861	Do you guys want to know when 2DX7Style is coming out?
5882901	5884581	After you vote for it.
5885701	5886382	This is the deal.
5886562	5887122	And order it.
5887902	5889602	But MontyStyle put out the news this week.
5889642	5891323	Jamie, you want to run down by it?
5891963	5893323	I glanced at it.
5893463	5896684	I didn't bother translating the page yet because I'm just going to order it from Himaya.
5898085	5905707	But there's a big voting poll, and if enough people vote, then they're going to put out another 2DX7Style.
5907731	5910152	Yeah, and you know, I don't know if they're going to get enough.
5910172	5913194	Isn't it supposed to be like 7th and 8th?
5913214	5915675	Isn't it supposed to be something like 7th and 8th style mixed together?
5916696	5917356	That's the rumor.
5917776	5920118	But you know, I'm not horribly excited.
5920998	5923159	Because I know that not enough people are going to vote for it.
5924260	5924900	Well, I don't know.
5924920	5928122	If enough people vote for it, then it'll be good.
5928182	5930603	But I'm just going to order it from Himeya anyway.
5931243	5934285	Because you already know about my trouble with Konami style.
5935553	5937474	Oh, you don't have the right kind of credit card.
5937494	5939575	We're going to revoke your 2DX controller order.
5940456	5940996	Bite me.
5943577	5951101	You know what's interesting is that a lot of this came up because 2DX, they announced that they're going to make new controllers.
5951682	5958205	And suddenly people went, wait a minute, Konami, why is Konami making new 2DX arcade style controllers if they haven't put out a home version forever?
5958505	5963668	And that's kind of where this came about is that it was like, okay, now maybe since they're doing these controllers, they're going to do a new consumer style too.
5964477	5970141	Now, with the new controllers, though, then I might have to toss down the $400 to order mine from Himea.
5970161	5973083	Unless you want to make me one.
5974844	5975604	I'll pay you to make me one.
5980087	5989033	If you want to see the information on that, you can head on over to... I'm just going to tell you to go to BimaniStyle.com because they have the links there on their front page, which isn't loading for me right now.
5989093	5989513	Bastards.
5990094	5990374	Oh, well.
5990574	5993616	They have the links to Konami, the site that you'll need.
5995538	5998442	So, how about a cage match, you guys?
5999103	5999443	Sure.
6000084	6000405	You know what?
6000465	6001346	I hope it happens, though.
6001386	6003889	I really want 7th Style at home.
6004450	6005952	I want Beauty of Silence so bad.
6005972	6012841	What makes me sad is that they'll probably cut all the licensed tracks if they're having to scrounge to do this, and that makes me a sad little panda.
6014778	6018340	Where the fuck is my Dance Maniacs home version, you bastard?
6018380	6019941	I just want to play Last Message at home.
6021161	6023283	It's like one of the few seven stars I can pass.
6024943	6027585	I can pass, like, Last Message.
6028806	6030747	I can pass that and Monkey Dance.
6032207	6035449	And, uh, what's the other seven I can pass, Rob?
6036630	6037310	Please don't go.
6037330	6039451	That's what I thought.
6039871	6042033	Breaking my fingers working on Love Me Do, I gave up.
6044642	6047584	Oh my god, my finger's bleeding!
6047784	6050166	I cannot play the 2DX anymore!
6050726	6052528	Oh my god, I am the sock!
6053228	6054389	I have no arms!
6056050	6057511	What was that movie that that was from?
6058412	6059333	It was called The Kids.
6059833	6063376	That movie sucked, but this isn't movie discussion, this is... Oh.
6065017	6067879	In response to Nostalin, the Eurobeat song sucks.
6068119	6069220	Why are you singing it?
6072569	6073569	I like your Obeat.
6074590	6081532	I like your... And you know, we need to do a shameless plug here for our forums that nobody goes to anymore.
6082412	6082892	Agreed.
6085373	6093915	The only thing that lives on the forums anymore is the quote thread, which is... I think the last thing that I saw in the quote thread was me trying to do chat para para.
6094983	6095563	But you know what?
6096063	6100225	If the forums don't work for you, at www.callybomani.com, click on forums.
6101325	6104846	You can also visit our Orange Lounge Live Journal, where we post a lot of things.
6104866	6109328	And we would like people to post more, so it's not just always Jamie announcing her show in the Live Journal.
6109648	6112369	But it's username Orange Lounge, all one word on Live Journal.
6112389	6112669	You know what?
6112709	6114089	I don't even announce my show anymore.
6114109	6115390	I get DarkSakura to do it.
6115450	6117311	Okay, so you get your minions to do it for you.
6117711	6121512	My hordes of fans do my bidding.
6123489	6125193	If that worked, I would do that all the time.
6128041	6130026	Okay, we're going to do the cage match.
6131089	6131991	So last week...
6133777	6134818	and New Orange Lounge Cage Match.
6134858	6136559	Yeah, I win because it went no better.
6137079	6143363	The way the cage match works is that three songs get put in, you vote for your favorite, and it wins.
6143704	6144704	Last week was interesting.
6144744	6148327	Because of the Comcast problems, we weren't able to get enough voters from our chat room.
6148687	6152509	So we combined their votes with in-house voting, which we haven't done in a long time.
6153510	6156512	But we're going to go back to a strictly chat room vote tonight.
6156552	6159134	So make sure if you want to vote in tonight's cage match, you're in our chat room.
6159734	6162716	www.calibermoney.com, click on Orange Lounge and click on chat.
6163097	6173484	Last week it came down to a tie between Loki's latest remix and Jamie's song, and I picked Jamie's song because I felt bad she hadn't won in a while, and I liked her song anyway.
6173704	6174805	I got the pity vote.
6174945	6175665	She got a pity vote.
6176206	6176366	What?
6178167	6179187	Loki's song didn't suck.
6179207	6179607	Quit saying it.
6179627	6180448	He says his song sucked.
6180708	6181208	It didn't suck.
6181628	6182629	Alright, so here it is.
6182689	6185170	Here's last week's winner and the first song you can vote for tonight.
6185570	6188492	It's Free Fall featuring Jan Johnston, who I rather like.
6188872	6190753	And this song is called Skydive.
6190873	6191273	Enjoy.
6191373	6194475	Actually, we're only going to play a clip of it because it did win last week.
6194575	6195875	So, here you go.
6197016	6197476	Skydive
6200066	6207311	All my favorites, my low end screams my name Take his hand, I'm afraid to run, run, run to you I'll be your one and only, one and only
6322584	6324266	Alright, that was last week's winner.
6326669	6330513	Jan Johnston with the band Free Fall with a song called Skydive.
6331014	6333096	Next up is Loki's pick.
6333256	6334517	Loki, what did you pick for us tonight?
6335118	6336560	Guess what came out this week?
6337228	6339390	Yep, that's right, Ayumi Trance 3.
6339771	6344856	Yes, that's right, I picked another Ayumi Trance song because I'm lazy and I don't care.
6345577	6350002	So, you get to listen to Naturally, the Whippinbird mix, because Naturally is pretty cool.
6351263	6353526	Alright, here it is, song number two in tonight's cage match.
6353566	6356970	It's Ayumi Hamasaki from Cybertrance 3 with Naturally.
6357110	6357390	Enjoy.
6367429	6368913	Thanks for watching!
6390964	6391905	Thank you for watching!
6482236	6483457	Thank you for watching!
6552732	6553733	Thank you for watching!
6635155	6638119	All right, gang, that was song number two in tonight's cage match.
6638359	6642964	New entry, Ayumi Hamasaki from Cybertrans 3 with Naturally, the Wittenberg mix.
6643004	6645767	Let's go around, see what the room thought of it, starting off with Who's Got a Mic?
6646562	6646862	Jamie.
6646962	6648303	It's Transtastic.
6649084	6649244	Um, 9.
6651586	6652106	Uh, Puppy.
6652126	6657950	Uh, it's cool because it's Ayumi, but I kind of like the original.
6657970	6659871	I like the original naturally better, though.
6660452	6661252	Uh, but this is still good.
6661272	6662873	I'll give it an 8.
6664614	6664995	Alrighty.
6665895	6667116	Uh, ViolentHyperGirl.
6667677	6669338	I think it's cool just because I like Ayumi.
6670635	6674458	And on a scale of 1 to 10, you give it a... Probably like a 7 or 8.
6675338	6676419	7 or 8, so 7 and a half.
6677039	6677360	Yeah.
6677400	6678680	You can do halves, it's acceptable.
6679001	6680742	Yay, 7 and a half.
6680982	6682843	Moving on, Bradley or Loki, whoever grabs the mic.
6682863	6683183	Bradley.
6684384	6685045	That's not pretty good.
6685445	6685985	I'll give it a 9.
6686606	6687747	Give it a 9.
6687907	6689768	I think it was pretty rockin'.
6689848	6692250	It's not my favorite song on the new Trance CD, but it's pretty good.
6692270	6692750	8 and a half.
6693210	6693470	Loki.
6696132	6700215	Motherfuckin' controller I slashed across the ground and that's bad.
6700863	6710565	Anyways, I give it a... I don't give a crap because I picked it randomly out of the CD I downloaded, so... Yeah.
6711665	6712305	I give it a 9.
6716066	6712305	9.
6716486	6718087	I give the third sex a 10!
6719227	6722087	Alright, so there you have it, the votes for Yumi Hamasaki with Naturally.
6722107	6724208	But remember, the ultimate decision is up to you.
6725217	6728901	and head on over to our chat room, www.callybomani.com.
6729141	6730543	Click on orange.
6730803	6732885	Mental note, or you can write this down somewhere.
6733986	6734767	Flash game.
6734947	6736569	Ferret sex, the flash game.
6737069	6738050	When the website comes up.
6738110	6738711	I'll work on that.
6738751	6742174	When we get our other website up, which we've been needing to do for a month.
6742414	6745377	Or even just like an animated gif or something.
6746138	6746719	What, puppy?
6748100	6748881	I'm not going to do that.
6749229	6757473	Alright, next up is my pick, and I've got, I assure you, what will go down in history, it's a Rob Classic pick tonight.
6758193	6767257	So, I'm afraid, I asked, now, don't blame me, because I asked the room, do you want my pick tonight to be something trance, or something booty and foul?
6767617	6771398	And they picked booty and foul, so, this is the song you get.
6771859	6777001	But this is something, if my baby mama can make solo bass, I think this song can make solo bass.
6777461	6778823	So this is my pick for tonight.
6779424	6781847	It's a group call, and I have to thank the Ice Queen.
6782689	6783810	He recommended this one to me.
6783890	6785092	Ice Queen recommended me to this one.
6785613	6788717	This is Fanny Pack with a song called Camel Toe.
6789538	6790419	Camel Toe.
6790580	6791180	Camel Toe.
6791301	6791641	Enjoy.
6792262	6794165	I'm... Yes, these are my cups.
6828285	6828845	Outro Music
6980937	6983201	Alright, that was the last song in tonight's cage match.
6983281	6985926	My pick, Fanny Pack with Camel Toe.
6986026	6987829	Thank you Ice Queen for picking that one out for me.
6988290	6988631	Jamie!
6989542	6991203	That was so ghetto booty.
6991603	6992544	Oh my god, Rob.
6993845	6996186	Alright, you need to be spanked for that song.
6997828	6998588	Not by me, though.
6998648	7001230	We'll talk to somebody who's not here tonight.
7002130	7002391	Okay.
7003011	7003871	On a scale of 1 to 10?
7006393	7008374	I don't think that numbers can quantify it.
7009295	7011256	It gets a B for booty.
7011977	7012317	Alright.
7012337	7013878	So I guess it translates to an 8.
7014458	7014919	Okay, Erin.
7014939	7015039	Erin.
7016849	7017289	8 for good laughs.
7017309	7017469	Puppies!
7042992	7048513	Just the fact that the name of the song is Camel Toad is ridiculous in itself.
7049694	7050554	I mean, come on.
7051254	7051874	What next?
7053655	7056555	I mean, next thing you know, there's going to be a song called Blue Balls.
7059136	7060096	There may well be.
7061176	7062597	Jamie's threatening to write it right now.
7063597	7065077	It'll be the next Politary song.
7065157	7067018	The next remix I make will be...
7067831	7068892	Insert song name here.
7069213	7070374	The Blues Balls Mix.
7070474	7070714	Yes.
7071355	7073296	Ooh, it'd be even better if it was a blues song.
7073857	7075018	Let Puppy finish his thought.
7076199	7077280	There's a thought?
7079583	7080323	He has to give a number.
7080363	7082926	I didn't know I would... 3.159.
7084147	7084567	Alright.
7085368	7085809	Uh, Bradley.
7086209	7086690	Just because.
7086710	7088852	Just because.
7089472	7089973	Just because.
7092575	7093515	Best song ever, 10, Loki.
7114197	7124101	Um, yeah, you know, the white in me says seven, but the ghetto black in me says ten.
7125521	7126662	So what's that average, too?
7126822	7127462	Nine point nine?
7127482	7134565	Uh, er, nine, wait, nine and a half.
7135465	7135785	All right.
7137637	7138577	Okay, here we go.
7138657	7139777	Let's recap.
7140678	7144298	For those of you that haven't voted before, you have to send a private message to me in the chat room.
7144318	7146619	You have to send it over private message or it doesn't count.
7146659	7148219	If you say it publicly in the room, it doesn't count.
7148619	7154621	And I know we have some new chatters in there tonight, so I'll type out how you do that for those of you that don't know.
7154981	7157041	And sorry, but you can't vote for Holic.
7157241	7160682	Alright, let's recap, shall we, real fast.
7160822	7164783	Song number one, last week's winner, Free Fall featuring Janz Johnston with Skydive.
7174269	7180053	All right, song number two that you can vote for tonight is Yumi Hamasaki from Cybertrans 3 with a song called Naturally.
7190285	7203609	Alright, and song number three you can vote for tonight is a band called Fanny Pack with the song Camel Toe.
7204069	7204389	Alright.
7204710	7206210	Hmm, I wonder what's gonna win.
7206510	7207931	Alright, vote now.
7208051	7209551	Place vote now!
7213612	7216293	In the meantime, Loki, why don't you tell us what's going on in the sim world?
7219830	7222715	Damn piece of wire doesn't want to go through my hole.
7223216	7224959	Anyways, in the controller.
7225200	7225921	Hole in the controller.
7227298	7239402	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
7257606	7259648	Asian, I kid you not, Asian mix.
7259808	7262551	All the music in it must be sung by an Asian singer.
7263031	7267715	So it has to be, you know, in, you know, Japanese or, you know, Chinese, Korean.
7270037	7277163	It's, it's, it's trying to, um, they're trying to basically spark interest for Turning Mix 5.
7277524	7282668	So basically this is going to be the, this is going to be the poorly run, um, Stepchild that's in the middle.
7282988	7283169	So...
7285612	7301937	For this Asian mix, it better be really, really good Japanese or Korean songs, because we all know where Chinese pop went, or is going, and, you know... But it seems like, judging from the last remix, a lot of people don't have that good a song taste.
7304618	7308459	You know, technically, you can have Russian music, too, because part of Russia is in Asia.
7309140	7309820	So we can have Tattoo!
7315526	7326091	But yeah, and obviously, the only good, honestly the only good Chinese songs there are, are basically slow songs and some trance slash techno, but not much.
7327791	7330372	Oh, I haven't listened to Tide Pops though, not very much.
7333033	7337155	Yeah, India's in Asia too, so Dollar Mendy all around.
7337735	7341117	Tunak, Tunak, Tunak.
7342680	7344660	Oh, get over Tunak Tunak already.
7344701	7345221	Come on.
7345281	7346921	That song is fucking used.
7347241	7347921	It's done.
7350042	7352662	Yeah, hello and welcome to a joke that is fucking moldy.
7352802	7353783	It's done.
7354363	7355523	I'm sick of Tunak Tunak.
7358584	7358904	Yeah.
7359404	7364125	Let's play Magic the Gathering and listen to our, you know, Lilith Fair music while we, you know...
7364961	7366182	You mean Dungeons and Dragons?
7389990	7392831	I mean, what useless songs are going to come out of this?
7393071	7394192	Honestly, it's horrid.
7395092	7395332	I know.
7395532	7397613	We're going to see a gazillion Ayumi songs.
7397673	7405016	And if you think I'm going to jump off my ass to make you your stupid Max 2 USA license tracks, think again.
7405216	7410198	I don't care because I haven't played Step Mania in three months and I am not going to make your stupid tracks.
7410598	7414860	So you're going to have to wait for DDRUK to make them because they're good at everything.
7416360	7418421	Even though I made them the last two times and they took credit.
7419212	7422233	to a credit because they said, oh, they were out of sync.
7423053	7424054	You're out of sync.
7424934	7425254	I'm done.
7428655	7429875	It's not just that Yumi songs.
7429895	7434377	There's probably going to be a lot of stupid Pop Finkel, SES, Shinhwa songs.
7435477	7437238	Last call for cage match votes in the chat room.
7437958	7439118	I have a challenge to issue.
7439338	7439558	Yes.
7439718	7442439	I want Dragon Ash or Malice Miser.
7442879	7447461	I would love to see some visual K done or...
7448602	7453707	I would love to see just some good, you know, uber goth J-rock make it into the turning mix.
7454528	7455629	See how they pull that off.
7458111	7461074	Like, you know, have like the Beast of Blood video playing in the background or something.
7467681	7468762	What am I going to do with it?
7469803	7470223	Like this?
7470243	7470764	Like this?
7476139	7476539	All right.
7477859	7480459	Would you guys like to hear who got the cage match tonight?
7480519	7481820	Because we have collected all the votes.
7482020	7482780	All right.
7482900	7483240	Wow.
7483920	7491522	Yeah, I just try to wrap it up quick now because we tend to do FUs in cage match back-to-back, and I have to close out all the private messages for FUs as if you needed to know that.
7491582	7493222	So here we go.
7493262	7494322	I haven't gotten any more votes.
7494382	7495943	So here is tonight's winner.
7495963	7497083	You guys ready for it?
7497103	7497163	Yes.
7498383	7501166	It is a tie.
7501707	7504409	Oh, lovely.
7505570	7511616	No, the way the rules go is that the host whose song did not tie will break the tie.
7512237	7520966	And tonight, song one, song one that tied was Camel Toe.
7521626	7522027	Figures.
7523777	7529900	Song number two that tied tonight was... If the damn thing will play.
7530080	7530920	Let me guess, a Yumi?
7531140	7532701	Yes, it was a Yumi.
7532821	7536243	So it means... So it goes, Jamie gets to break the tie.
7536623	7539844	And she gets to break the tie, and hopefully she remembers the favor I gave her last week.
7542326	7543766	But not to influence her vote or anything.
7544627	7545227	Give it to the butt.
7546307	7546908	Give it to Camel Toe?
7546928	7547988	Give it to the booty.
7548428	7551590	All right, Camel Toe is this week's cage match winner.
7557808	7560410	So, Camel Toe wins by a vote of one.
7560490	7561491	I also call.
7561511	7561631	What?
7562052	7564093	That be the FU music for the chat room.
7565635	7567756	Okay, that will be the FU music for the chat room tonight.
7567796	7568157	That's fine.
7570143	7577286	Okay, if you want to visit our webcam, www.callybomondi.com, click on Orange Lounge and click on Chat.
7577666	7590471	The site you can see on the cam right now is Puppy hunched over with a microphone, Loki soldering in the background, Aaron has been on and off the cam, and Jamie hides from the cam, so she randomly holds objects up.
7592361	7595962	Alright, guess what's coming up when we take this break, kids?
7596482	7597083	After this break.
7598603	7599683	Come on, we do it every week.
7601144	7601644	FUs.
7602144	7602924	We all know it.
7602964	7603805	Why do we have to guess?
7604005	7605385	Because it's the fun part.
7605425	7605705	Alright.
7607326	7607866	Yes, Jamie?
7608286	7610267	I have a microphone now, so just play my damn music.
7610347	7611347	Well, we're not doing any FUs yet.
7611367	7612088	We're taking a break first.
7612448	7612888	I don't care.
7613468	7613789	Alright.
7615169	7619651	In this break, we're going to hear more Max 2 USA music, and this is a lot of... You know what?
7619751	7619951	What?
7620331	7622573	I don't understand why they don't just let me pick all the music.
7623453	7623793	What do you mean?
7623813	7624433	For Max 2?
7625114	7625294	No.
7625314	7626554	I meant, like, in general.
7627275	7630116	I should, like, petition Konami to let me pick everything.
7632984	7637566	The only thing that some of those songs are good for being picked for is, like, picking noses.
7638166	7639266	I don't know.
7639446	7641027	They're all really good songs, though, so go ahead and play them.
7641767	7642047	All right.
7642407	7642847	Here we go.
7643207	7645548	In this break, you're going to hear a lot of songs that were requested.
7645608	7652751	Tomorrow, Perfume in this break, Will I, and SFMP with Try To Love You.
7653031	7654411	You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
7654451	7655812	Tell a friend we're on the air.
7656872	7658753	We'll be back after this.
7677458	7678461	Thanks for watching!
7707128	7707911	Thanks for watching!
7743369	7743952	Thanks for watching!
7779110	7779771	Thanks for watching!
7834795	7839159	Will I ever love you again?
7841621	7845965	Will we be together again?
7848428	7852492	Thought the love we had was strong
7854407	7859970	Tell me what's wrong What did we go wrong?
7919962	7927665	No, no, nobody's love, no, nobody's love, no, nobody's love, yeah, baby, love
7955457	7966279	Bitch, get a new song.
7966919	7969380	An open letter from Orange Lounge Radio.
7969540	7973581	Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio episode number 62 in progress.
7974321	7976301	And Jamie, do you know what time it is?
7977682	7978122	Fuck you.
7979122	7981562	Actually, I don't have the music queued up yet.
7981943	7984083	You're supposed to take longer than that to answer the question.
7985453	7987754	It's time for me to throw a ferret at puppy.
7988174	7988474	Alright.
7989554	7990434	Okay, now I'm ready.
7991134	7992135	Jamie, what time is it?
7992215	7992735	I don't care.
7993135	7993755	Come on.
7994255	7995015	Uh-uh, you're no fun.
7995035	7995555	You weren't ready.
7997076	7997696	Jamie.
7998876	8002117	It's time for me to get a ferret thrown at my hand.
8002597	8003737	Stop throwing ferrets at me!
8008124	8012005	I haven't really had that bad of a week, but... Okay, stop that.
8037765	8041968	First off, a big F you goes to Puppy for throwing a ferret at my boob.
8043649	8047212	And for throwing a ferret at ViolentHyperGirl's ass.
8049834	8050955	But you were the target.
8051695	8052736	So it's your fault.
8053897	8057239	It's your fault for... Stop it.
8057579	8057900	Okay.
8059121	8061742	Another one goes for the rice I was cooking for being too wet.
8063083	8065025	That's my fault because I put in too much water.
8066395	8070957	I can't help it, you know, the rice was just so hot.
8072377	8075698	And it couldn't help being moist, you know, because I was touching it.
8078579	8081660	I was rolling it around and making balls with it.
8083780	8088802	Anyway, another F you goes to being hot, because I am right now.
8092059	8095461	Another one goes toward my laundry for not being dry, so I'm drying it again.
8096882	8101844	Another F you goes toward ferret sex.
8105066	8109488	Another F you goes toward all the people who are not signed up for my message board.
8113350	8114770	It's roleplay.darksakura.com
8120971	8126016	I think I'm going to throw on there, by the way, a sexual roleplay.
8126596	8129499	I'm going to make it hidden for all of you people who are into the kinky crap.
8131120	8134083	There's going to be one for tops and one for bottoms.
8134483	8136044	And then the sadomasochism.
8136565	8137546	We'll throw that in there, too.
8137606	8137866	Yeah.
8137966	8138647	Sounds like fun.
8138687	8139427	It's forthcoming.
8140188	8143311	Other than that, I'm really... Oh, yeah.
8143991	8145633	Fuck the sheriff who was...
8146351	8148172	Freaking following me and tailgating me.
8148432	8149193	And then it passed me.
8149813	8150834	And I was going to speed limit.
8151014	8153676	I freaking hate the double standard.
8154897	8157078	And then the tow truck.
8157138	8158599	It's not one of those typical tow trucks.
8158619	8160060	This is one of the ones with the flatbed.
8160080	8162762	It's like huger than God truck.
8163603	8165724	And it was right on my ass the whole time here.
8166104	8167325	I was like, okay, you need to get off.
8167886	8168886	You are not a hemorrhoid.
8169167	8169867	I am too young.
8170607	8170928	You know.
8173349	8173970	And then, um...
8176408	8177609	Really, I think that's about it.
8178629	8182431	Oh yeah, a big FU goes to my sleep pattern, which is going to hopefully be corrected.
8183311	8184852	And I got a really cool hat.
8185172	8185592	Okay, bye.
8186772	8188773	Alright, next up is Loki.
8193035	8196016	Yeah, anyways, I think I'm wrapped around you here.
8196696	8196956	Okay.
8198877	8201338	Yeah, I'm trying to get to my first FU here.
8201718	8203559	I just have to find something.
8205160	8205480	There it is.
8206235	8208917	Okay, can you turn down the music, like, off?
8209697	8214440	Okay, first FU of the week goes to Konami, okay?
8215801	8218202	Mainly the group System SF.
8218522	8223445	I don't know who the fuck you think you are, but I don't like you blatantly ripping off other songs.
8224126	8224866	Really, I don't.
8225267	8227368	This piracy stuff has to stop.
8227948	8231330	Now, this song I'm going to play for you is by another group.
8233155	8236556	with a very similar name to System SF.
8236676	8240016	It's called System F. They predated you by five years.
8240517	8241517	So here's their song.
8241897	8245017	It's also their very big hit song called Out of the Blue.
8245278	8246498	See if this sounds familiar.
8248758	8249938	Out of the Blue
8277731	8279233	What kind of disco was it?
8279454	8283499	I don't know, could it be something that was maybe on, I don't know, Be Rare 5?
8283539	8285803	Something that's gonna make people scream.
8285823	8287405	Star, Star, what's it called?
8295353	8298195	It's freaking feelings won't fade, you goddamn retards.
8298215	8300536	You didn't do anything to change the song at all.
8300736	8301877	You blatantly stole it.
8302037	8304938	You can't say that you covered it because, well, there's no singing.
8305319	8306679	So, you suck.
8307059	8308600	Come up with some original shit.
8308941	8312843	I'm sure Look to the Skies will probably rip off of something else, but I have to find it first.
8313443	8314744	So, you're lucky for now.
8315544	8316865	I'm about to expose you.
8319574	8325239	But anyways, yes, I am very pissed off at the fact that you blatantly ripped off Out of the Blue.
8325579	8328821	So, that's enough of that.
8329122	8330583	And sorry about the Bumani Cell thing.
8331524	8334946	Another F you to them for having their goddamn music on their front page.
8335106	8336527	I hate that goddamn music.
8336948	8341451	Be like DDR Mania X and keep it turned off, unless I want it turned on.
8341992	8344294	Or changes to something else, you know, something catchy.
8346673	8348715	Also, FU... One little comment, sorry.
8348835	8349035	Yeah.
8349255	8354159	I thought that the whole deal of having, you know, music play on your main page went out when people stopped using GeoCities.
8356461	8359123	Well, it came back with people using Flash on their pages.
8360224	8361725	Um... It came back with Zynga.
8361845	8363346	And Shockwave, actually.
8364767	8367690	But anyways, no, but mine still rocks, other than their little music.
8368090	8369291	Change the music and you'll be perfect.
8370012	8372894	Um... An FU for, um...
8374036	8380117	Let's see, first off, for the stages at RVGL still being kind of slanted.
8380798	8386239	It's kind of not quite flat, so that kind of sucks.
8387279	8393401	F you to the fact that, let's see, I don't know, I'm not too angsty.
8393801	8396341	F you to the stupid drivers because I hate you everywhere.
8396641	8399262	And there's all types of drivers and I think I yelled at you all today.
8399982	8402764	You have to quote Jahi on this one.
8402784	8404745	A hole in your muffler does not make a modification.
8429455	8437444	No, but anyways, um... F you to, uh... I don't know.
8438204	8440066	I got thrown off when people start talking.
8442029	8442129	Um...
8444341	8444801	Oh, I know.
8445241	8459244	After you, the stupid bitch that, like, ran over our curb at work, it, like, um, totally shattered it all, and now my friend's probably gonna get blamed for it, because, you know, they have a giant bus, and, you know, it's gonna look like the bus ran over it, even though it's the delivery man, so that kinda sucks.
8460044	8469026	Um, fuck you, the G4, because, um, you still suck, you haven't heeded any of my advice, and, you know, you can burn in hell.
8469506	8471187	You don't even have any new programming.
8471367	8473448	You're talking about what happened at E3.
8475509	8475789	Okay?
8476690	8478211	E3's been over for a while now.
8478551	8478851	Okay?
8479491	8481532	E3 is not breaking news, okay?
8483093	8488236	And to say that you have new daily content is a lie anyways, because you film your shows like once every month.
8489436	8492238	And then repeat them over and over and over and over and over again.
8492758	8498261	Also, playing full motion video, or not necessarily full motion video, but playing...
8498962	8503504	Video game screenshots to music does not constitute a show.
8504745	8505605	So please stop.
8509387	8514729	And, um... What the hell are you... They're eating Mike and Ike's with chopsticks.
8514749	8515489	Stop being Asian.
8517130	8518350	I don't think she can help that.
8518711	8520451	Not talking about puppies.
8522072	8526034	But, um... Uh... Yeah...
8527449	8530331	I don't know, F you to our racist neighbor.
8535195	8535876	I'm done.
8535936	8539078	I don't have anything to bitch about right now because it doesn't come to me.
8539098	8540880	It's just like, yeah.
8543702	8544162	Alright.
8545683	8546144	My turn.
8546943	8548643	This song makes me want to eat some beef.
8549103	8550384	My FUs are pretty quick this week.
8550624	8555325	FU to the fact that everything in this goddamn town closes so early.
8555465	8556345	I hate that shit.
8556365	8561326	And I know I've said FU about this before, but I'm saying it again because it's still true.
8561406	8562166	This town sucks.
8562746	8565166	So, that's my first FU.
8565206	8569127	My second FU goes to two things that happened in San Francisco.
8569547	8574028	There's the Folsom Street Fair, which happened today.
8574928	8576689	That happened today in San Francisco.
8577090	8579851	And the Castro Street Fair, which happens next Sunday.
8580492	8582393	Why does this shit happen on a Sunday?
8582953	8585295	I can't go if you have this stuff on a Sunday.
8585755	8586836	Have it on a Saturday.
8586896	8587536	You suck.
8588057	8589498	And your town is dirty.
8589618	8591359	And I know a lot of people live in San Francisco.
8591659	8594080	It's like our number one market, but you know what?
8594781	8596082	The town is dirty.
8598514	8601036	I'm sure it's not you guys that listen to Horizons Radio to make it dirty.
8601076	8602317	It's the other million people living there.
8602337	8603377	We can't pick up their trash.
8604138	8604718	It's gross.
8604879	8605879	Frisco's a gross city.
8605919	8608261	Oh my god, do a million people really live in San Francisco?
8608281	8611904	I think it's actually 700,000, but I'm counting the surrounding area a little bit too.
8611924	8613245	That's why I'm glad I don't live there.
8614786	8616508	Alright, so, yeah.
8616808	8619730	Screw you, San Francisco, and your stupid planning.
8621011	8621351	Alright.
8622973	8624033	Rest of the room's turn.
8624053	8625595	Let's start with Puppy.
8625615	8625755	Puppy.
8628823	8632044	Whoa, I almost did not catch the microphone.
8633385	8637266	Are we having like a porn DVD slideshow on the camera or something?
8637286	8638067	Damn, FUs.
8640108	8645690	Okay, um, fuck you to class starting because it's class and that's just the way it is.
8646910	8653593	And, um, fuck you to my bike for like being really crappy.
8655839	8664154	and fucking through the tree outside over the parking lot at my apartment complex because it made my car really fucking dirty with a whole bunch of sap and tree shit.
8666653	8669874	and, um, um, hmm.
8670994	8676436	Fuck Ikea, because of the press sawdust crap.
8679296	8681677	And fuck Scandia for going to shit.
8684157	8685818	And, yeah, I'm done.
8689199	8689279	RKDN.
8692096	8696077	Yeah, okay, uh, fuck you to general stupidity, especially when it's my own, yeah.
8696897	8698638	Uh, fuck you to stupid telemarketers.
8699278	8702719	I gotta, I, cause I, on Tuesday, I got a call.
8703019	8705820	I, I have to now, I have to pick up the phone, cause people might call me now.
8706520	8707700	And, I might have to talk to people.
8708300	8712341	So, I pick up the phone, and it says, please, we have no available operators.
8712522	8713962	Please wait for the next operator.
8714542	8715502	I hate that shit.
8716162	8717663	So fucking stupid.
8718294	8718895	So I had to hang up.
8718935	8719635	I hung up before.
8720396	8720696	Idiots.
8722658	8725120	Let's see, anything else to say fuck you to?
8726981	8727562	Oh, man.
8733026	8734047	Fuck you for doing it right.
8736710	8736990	Damn.
8737350	8738751	Yeah, I think I'm out of it.
8739232	8741534	I might think of something, so go ahead.
8741614	8741794	Aaron.
8743311	8752122	I don't have a lot this week, actually, but, um, Fuck You goes to whoever broke the wheel on the initial D-machine at the MU Arcade.
8753063	8757828	It, thanks to you, it no longer has the 270 degrees in either direction.
8757848	8760552	It goes... Yes, it spins freely!
8760612	8762494	It's just like RTA all over again.
8763260	8769302	And I think I know, I think it was one of those fat teenie bop, fat like high school teenie boppers I saw there on like Friday afternoon.
8769942	8770863	So I'm not for sure.
8770883	8772183	I was broken a couple days ago.
8773444	8775024	Oh no, it wasn't broken, trust me.
8775745	8776925	It wasn't bro- was it?
8776945	8779006	I was there on Friday morning.
8780106	8781507	No, I was there before that, I think.
8783207	8783847	Whatever.
8783867	8786328	But, um, let's see.
8786348	8790590	Haku goes to Workload English 57 for being exactly like high school?
8791266	8796210	I don't like group work, I don't like the teacher, and I hate it, and I want to get out of there as fast as possible.
8799492	8806797	Fuck you, those stupid neighbors who live outside me who are always either blasting the music or trying to be ghetto thugs.
8808558	8809739	Be yourselves for once.
8810139	8810760	Come on now.
8812201	8813762	They are ghetto thugs.
8813782	8815343	They're trying to act like ghetto thugs.
8817084	8820847	And... I can't really think of any...
8823370	8828436	Oh yeah, and fuck you to that stupid skillet that my parents gave me that doesn't actually work.
8828496	8830258	It just happens to burn everything that you put in it.
8831380	8833122	Because it's metal and it's not cast iron.
8833182	8833583	So yeah.
8836827	8839751	Alright, let's move on and see what our chat room has to say, shall we?
8843260	8853048	Brack2000 would like to say, F you to Overloaded, the Lesson 2 song, not being a real DDR Max 2 song, and only a stupid Lesson Mode song.
8854549	8857171	Uh-oh, VHG needs to respond to something in the showroom.
8857191	8858813	Someone asked why I'm in workload English.
8858873	8865258	It's because I got cocky on my subject A, and I didn't put a thesis in my essay, so now I'm stuck there, and my friends are in workload English.
8866727	8867808	Biohazard has a lot of these cheeses.
8881058	8883639	Fuck me for missing Orange Lounge Radio for three weeks.
8883679	8884519	That's right, fuck you.
8886180	8888780	Fuck Overloaded for being so owns-or.
8889721	8891041	Fuck Chex Quest.
8891301	8892402	These are coming from Biohazard.
8893342	8895623	Fuck 2DX controllers being so expensive.
8896143	8898323	Fuck my CD burner for being broken.
8898443	8902665	Fuck my QX949 for its bad mid-left front channel capacitor.
8903385	8904265	Capacitor, sorry.
8904605	8905166	I read that wrong.
8905606	8906146	Sorry!
8907326	8909367	Fuck my terrible C++ compiler.
8911317	8917119	Fuck the guy who sold me a wireless PS2 controller and just cut the cord off a regular controller.
8919340	8920080	That's great.
8922041	8928683	Did Loki, was that you?
8928963	8933745	Biohazard also says, fuck my jelly bean tin having a finite supply on jelly bellies.
8935569	8939735	Fuck HAPP controllers for wanting $12.99 for a 2DX style button.
8940857	8942759	Fuck peeps who talk like this.
8943000	8943941	This is Asian writing.
8944762	8945764	I'm sorry, ASEAN writing.
8946144	8947826	And expect me to read it.
8948948	8950170	Fuck really negative people.
8951153	8960435	It's funny, regardless of how old these people are, they still talk like they're in middle school.
8960715	8963415	Just pay the money for the half controls button.
8963435	8965216	I bought like 16 of them.
8965296	8966036	Get over it.
8972597	8973057	Moving on.
8974778	8976598	HK Holly, Aaron would like to read this one.
8977624	8982226	This is mostly an inside joke from Calibimani, but fuck you, green vaginal ooze.
8985807	8986407	Beautiful.
8987007	8989088	Vaginal ooze is funny when it's green, too.
8990829	8991389	Boy, oh boy.
8992789	8996132	23rd Magus would like to say, F you to Angel's fucked up work schedule.

9004339	9004779	No comment.
9005400	9009543	F you to hatching a pouring egg, naming it, giving it a backpack, and then forgetting to feed it.
9009883	9010544	20k down the hole.
9010984	9011945	That's a Ragnarok reference.
9012706	9015408	And once again, fuck the lamers on Ragnarok Online.
9015808	9016249	Please.
9016729	9017550	Or PLZ.
9017610	9018550	What's a PLZ?
9018951	9020872	Oh, you want me to heal the monster you're fighting?
9020992	9021373	Okay.
9024625	9025505	I have an F you.
9025545	9027146	I don't know if you just said it because I was in the bathroom.
9027927	9029907	A big fuck you goes to Botters on Ragnarok.
9030808	9031548	I hate you all.
9032188	9034910	And I hope that your computers explode and you all catch Stars of the Ass.
9036951	9037351	Thank you.
9040012	9042613	Chaos says F you to Heartburn.
9042853	9043273	That's it.
9045414	9046135	Heartburn does suck.
9046175	9046475	I hate it.
9048596	9052320	NoStylin says, my FU of the week is paying bills.
9052580	9055843	It's like you have bills and you pay them off and you have more of them.
9056304	9057685	And you wonder where the hell they came from.
9057745	9058526	So I go, huh.
9059006	9060568	You pay bills and more come.
9060588	9061308	What's up with that?
9061889	9064011	I find how once you get money, it's gone in a second.
9064051	9065232	So yeah, screw the government.
9065553	9068315	Screw Gray Davis and this whole recall thing.
9068596	9073060	And screw expensive schools that try to rip you off with name brand products which you don't have.
9075786	9076907	Screw you to the recall.
9077087	9078347	Governor and the recall?
9079787	9080007	Yes.
9080087	9080548	One or the other?
9080928	9082888	Screw you to anything involving the recall.
9082948	9083848	Just go away.
9085329	9087009	It involves him.
9087489	9093991	Tal would like to say F you to Final Fantasy Tactics Advance because I don't actually own the game or the Game Boy Advance so I have to borrow both.
9094291	9095192	You moocher!
9095572	9096192	You moocher!
9096212	9099553	You have my DDR Max and you have someone else's Tactics and Game Boy.
9099653	9100033	Mooch!
9101453	9102834	And you have Jamie's Parappa.
9103094	9103414	Mooch!
9104281	9106704	It's Moochie the Moocher here on Orson Welles Radio.
9107525	9108226	Mooch.
9108246	9108726	That's so bad.
9109587	9110068	Mooch.
9110088	9110368	Okay.
9111049	9111850	He's in Davis.
9112030	9113191	That's where he's supposed to be from.
9113392	9116215	Talon also likes to say, F you to initial D. I know you love me.
9116235	9118758	Because the music and the animation style sucks.
9118938	9121341	And the story is straight out of a bad samurai movie.
9122216	9124980	and FU to my DVD drive for dying.
9128324	9129205	All right, that's it.
9129405	9130547	That's all the FUs of the week.
9130567	9131348	Thank you for playing.
9133270	9137355	Okay, so I think we'll take another break.
9138576	9147498	We exhausted all our new Max MP3s, so why don't we go back and visit Max USA 1?
9148498	9149619	We'll go back and visit that.
9149679	9153660	We're going to play some songs from Max 1 USA.
9154000	9155680	I'm going to get stabbed with a pitchfork.
9155900	9158601	What am I getting stabbed with if I play Sandstorm?
9158621	9159621	Chopsticks.
9159641	9161982	Well, we're going to start this break off with Sandstorm.
9164842	9167123	And after that, we'll hear some other things from Max USA.
9169278	9169458	What?
9169498	9170259	Daughters die.
9172201	9172602	Thank you.
9172642	9173623	Thank you for sharing.
9173643	9174584	Find it from my message board.
9175364	9175705	All right.
9176005	9177366	We'll be back after this break.
9177527	9178748	And what do you guys think?
9179466	9181868	How about Ask Orange Lounge when we come back?

9182728	9188031	Alright, the chat room has some questions, so send your questions now for Ask Orange Lounge.
9188752	9192494	And for the 5,000th time, we'll play Overloaded after the show.

9195216	9197778	Yeah, I'm going to overload you in a minute.
9197838	9199619	Alright, we'll be back.

9481641	9484924	Alright, welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 62 in progress.
9485144	9489827	As promised, we're going to do Ask Orange Lounge, so send your questions to us now in the chat room.
9491288	9495992	Anybody have any quick thoughts, any other Bimani related things they wanted to talk about before we get into Ask Orange Lounge?
9496012	9497733	No, not really.
9498694	9500055	Any interesting Bimani stories?
9500075	9501656	I have a question to ask the chat room.
9501696	9502116	What's that?
9502437	9503077	Is it safe?
9503638	9504138	Is it safe?
9505439	9509282	Oh, you have to send your questions over private message or they aren't counted.
9510013	9515555	Also, real fast, just to plug some of our other programming on Orange Lodge Radio, bringing you live programming more throughout the week.
9516075	9523757	Tomorrow night is Vanilla Sky featuring myself and my cohorts in Crime Rice Princess and Lanky Style.
9523797	9530039	And we just sit around and we talk about other video games and we kind of talk about other weird stuff too.
9530059	9533500	We'll talk about what's in the news and how it relates to our world and things that piss us off.
9533820	9534941	Oh my God, you read the news.
9535041	9538662	And Yahoo, yes, we read the news to our listeners because they aren't going to get it any other way.
9539342	9545104	and we make fun of Yahoo and we do video game trivia to bad music and all sorts of fun things like that.
9545545	9547805	So tune in at 7 o'clock Monday night Pacific time.
9548346	9551927	On Tuesday nights... Excuse me.
9553067	9554248	That was a peanut burp.
9555788	9555909	Ew.
9556229	9556649	Um, anyway.
9557449	9559510	Um, Tuesday night is Pump Up the Volume.
9560456	9563199	where I play your requests from our chat room.
9563759	9566722	Except the thing is nobody requests anything, god damn it.
9566762	9568503	That's okay, more songs you get to play for yourself.
9568583	9573708	So you get to, I'll basically partake in my really weird taste in music.
9573728	9577051	I used to do a show called Ice for Five Minutes.
9577812	9578673	That's it on the channel.
9582396	9585519	This week on Orange Lounge Radio on Thursday, I will do a show called Ice...
9588021	9590623	Pikachu Pikachu Pikachu Pikachu
9618140	9618580	What's that?
9619941	9620362	No!
9620562	9621042	No!
9621643	9622463	Seriously!
9622624	9624225	A new show.
9625246	9625686	Seriously.
9626267	9627908	What are you talking about?
9627948	9629749	I can't get the mic any closer.
9629769	9630390	They're away.
9631150	9631551	Oh, okay.
9631771	9633332	Anyways, so, the new show.
9633973	9636114	It's gonna be a game show.
9636855	9637856	Ooh, a game show!
9637896	9638636	My favorite!
9638957	9641839	A new... Uh, yeah.
9641899	9643120	As long as there's nothing in the box.
9644401	9645442	Okay, you can have the box.
9647631	9654035	Anyways, new game show, possibly, if I decide I don't want to do Livewire anymore.
9654936	9660459	It will be, there will actually be prizes, serious, like real prizes given away.
9661160	9662260	And what kind of game show will this be?
9662280	9662821	Do we know yet?
9662981	9663261	I don't know.
9663961	9665803	Something crazy, very crazy.
9666163	9673127	I was going to call it like, attention... Why are the girls yelling for porn?
9674108	9675869	Like, it was either going to be called something like...
9677305	9678106	Shut up!
9678867	9682030	Like the 10 second attention span show or something like that.
9682230	9682550	Alright.
9683951	9684432	I'll be fine.
9686934	9687435	I'll be fine.
9688716	9689076	Porn!
9691218	9693480	Back to my show, which I am still...
9696118	9698019	It starts at 7 o'clock is the pre-show.
9698399	9699899	At 7.30 the show begins to 10.30.
9700860	9702340	And basically I just play a bunch of crap.
9703020	9707622	And I've been saying that I'm going to do video game music trivia, but I don't know.
9708502	9710723	People, send me songs.
9710983	9714164	You know, I'll have my IRC open.
9714204	9717265	My name is DarkSakuraSSF.
9717965	9720446	So start sending me video game music if you want to play.
9721046	9722707	If not, then you're a big stinky poopy head.
9723883	9727045	And that's the bottom line, because DarkSakura said so.
9727785	9731006	Okay.
9731727	9734808	Wednesday nights are open.
9734888	9739690	I was following the example of our, you know, Baymani influence system SF.
9740391	9742071	Wednesday nights are open right now.
9742111	9743672	We do a bit of randomness on Wednesdays.
9744052	9749555	This week, I've been asked to do Orange Lounge Presents Trivial Pursuit on Wednesday.
9749575	9749655	What?
9750410	9752031	Which we might do, I don't know yet.
9752812	9756555	I know there's enough interest from the regulars on all the shows to do it.
9757255	9757555	Okay.
9758736	9761158	If I was playing that, we'd have to break out the Genis edition.
9761218	9767082	So I'm thinking we're going to do Trivial Pursuit on Wednesday, but stay tuned to our chatroom for details.
9767343	9770805	So drop in our chatroom sometime during the week, and we'll have a Trivial Pursuit this Wednesday.
9770965	9772927	If you're not in the chatroom, you're not cool.
9772947	9775248	Yeah, if you're not in our chatroom 24 hours a day, you're not cool.
9775268	9776089	Okay.
9777174	9778717	When I visit, like, maybe once a week.
9781543	9783727	Well, if you're not there 24 hours a day, you're not cool.
9783767	9786032	But if you're there 24-hour days, you don't have a life.
9787695	9788376	And then you're not cool.
9790311	9791592	It's a paradox.
9792012	9792572	What a fun thought.
9792612	9794393	Either way, you're a loser.
9795334	9797535	All right.
9797575	9800197	Thursday night, Snowden's Lounge Radio is hiatus right now.
9800237	9802058	We might be doing some repeats of Livewire.
9802918	9805460	If I get brave, I might do a new mix, so we'll see.
9805660	9807161	Oh, there might be another potential.
9808621	9809622	I did one mega mix.
9809682	9811103	It played after Vanilla Sky one week.
9811763	9813304	There might be another potential goodie, though.
9813991	9815133	Hmm, a goodie.
9816215	9818860	Ah, yes, we have another show that may be coming up soon.
9818920	9820743	So, maybe not this Thursday, but soon.
9820823	9826633	Which, you know, I think that we need to introduce one of our newer listeners as another foreign correspondent.
9827649	9829630	Even though he probably can't make it up here.
9831230	9832010	He's probably not listening.
9832630	9833331	I don't think he's listening.
9833351	9834911	He's not in the chat room.
9834951	9836031	Make sure he's here next week.
9836051	9837872	He doesn't get foreign correspondent status.
9837992	9839992	We'll give him a proper introduction next week if he shows up.
9840032	9841933	In the meantime, we've only got 20 minutes left of show.
9842253	9843834	Actually, no, 25 because we started late tonight.
9844834	9847294	We have plenty of questions that have already been submitted.
9847334	9849035	It's not too late if you want to join in.
9850252	9852974	Go into www.callybomani.com.
9853134	9855115	Break out the earplugs because Rob's going to sing.
9855495	9857956	Click on Orange Lounge and click on chat.
9858356	9861998	And you can submit a question for Ask Orange Lounge.
9862558	9864099	We have to listen to Rob sing.
9867839	9869079	Let's Ask Orange Lounge.
9869099	9870880	That's a good question.
9871540	9874581	Rob's going to sing all week this week on Orange Lounge Radio.
9874681	9878362	Jamie needs to stop playing with a fucking ferret.
9878862	9882043	Or I'm going to get Loki to shove it up her ass.
9886104	9886424	All right.
9886504	9886764	Rob.
9887384	9887724	Rob.
9888064	9888304	Rob.
9888484	9888705	What?
9888805	9889025	Rob.
9889045	9889265	What?
9889425	9889625	Rob.
9889665	9889885	What?
9889965	9890145	Rob.
9890185	9890425	What?
9890525	9890725	Rob.
9890765	9891005	What?
9891385	9891705	Rob.
9891925	9892125	What?
9896124	9897005	All right.
9897485	9900247	Biohazard has about seven questions.
9900267	9902408	Shut up.
9902428	9905390	Biohazard has about seven questions to ask tonight.
9905930	9907771	Shut the fuck up.
9909292	9910733	Has about seven questions to ask.
9911733	9912034	What?
9917277	9918498	He's turning red in the face.
9918598	9920699	I'm starting off with questions from Biohazard.
9921604	9922345	Rob!
9922405	9923085	Rob!
9924166	9924486	Shut up.
9924786	9927808	Why doesn't Jimmy crack carrots or potatoes or something?
9927868	9929129	Corn is so boring.
9931551	9933012	Why doesn't Jimmy just do crack?
9934173	9934993	Good, I like that.
9937255	9944420	Biohazard also wants to know, how long will I have to wait for Overloaded to be available on Bomani Style or acquire it some other way?
9944720	9946161	Excuse me, are we Bomani Style?
9946301	9947462	Yeah, are we Bomani Style?
9947622	9949684	There's already a sim file up and it sucks.
9949744	9950244	Don't get it.
9954568	9956029	We're not the Monty style.
9956049	9956690	Go ask them.
9956850	9957651	Yeah, go ask them.
9959292	9964817	If you were a member of our Orange Lounge Radio Live Journal community, you would have already gotten a link to that file.
9965838	9966379	Oh, that's right.
9966419	9968421	Loki posted it earlier this week, didn't he?
9970523	9971984	Who cares about the step file?
9972024	9972464	Orange Lounge.
9972604	9973966	Make your own damn step file.
9975618	9978681	Oh yeah, and why he cracks corn so you don't care.
9979322	9980684	Because it's so boring, you don't care.
9981504	9984468	Sorry, we missed you on the first part.
9985088	9990875	People got a lot of free time if they're coming up with questions like, why does Jimmy crack corn and not potatoes?
9991415	9993137	You can't crack potatoes anyway.
9993157	9995380	I'll read one more from Biohazard, then I'm going to somebody else.
9995400	9996501	We'll come back to the rest of his questions.
9997000	10007122	Biohazard wants to know, how would I write a script for Sis Reset to display a random line from a TXT file every time exclamation bad joke is pulled?
10008322	10008902	Do what?
10009002	10010543	Is that like a chatbot?
10010583	10012143	It's some nerdy chatbot thing, yeah.
10012303	10015063	Well, you're not in our chatroom because we don't allow chatbots.
10015323	10020964	So, you know, you can go... I don't know, blow a gorilla.
10020984	10021725	Okay.
10024773	10025493	Who was that anyway?
10025934	10026914	Biohazard, again.
10026934	10027815	Don't use the chatbots.
10028135	10029636	We will kick you if you do.
10030276	10033237	Biohazard also wants to know, because Aaron really wants to answer this, so I'll do one more.
10033658	10035639	Why get mad when you can get glad?
10036979	10043042	Well, you know, I don't really know, but what I say is, why get mad when you can just use that energy and put it into sex?
10046224	10046964	Why get mad?
10047024	10047645	Get horny!
10047785	10049106	Don't get mad, get violent!
10052589	10056433	Oh, it's Violent Horny Girl here on Orange Lounge Radio, VHG.
10062198	10063940	Special guest, Violent Horny Girl.
10063980	10064421	I like it.
10064461	10064761	All right.
10067421	10068221	PPGL1.
10068481	10069462	Damn it, I'm not original.
10069522	10069802	All right.
10070102	10072502	But I was the first to call you Violent Hyper Gangbang, was I not?
10073583	10074223	Yes.
10074303	10075443	Violent Horny Gangbang.
10075843	10076863	Ah, Violent Horny Gangbang.
10076883	10077323	I like that.
10078064	10078604	Variation.
10078624	10080544	How about Velvet Horny Gangbang?
10082585	10083605	Violence is more fun.
10084225	10085045	All right.
10085185	10089146	23rd Magus would like to know, how's the food... Ah, who cares?
10089166	10089686	Be nice.
10091027	10092207	How's the food over there?
10093627	10094588	Because we all ate tonight.
10094868	10095948	Well, no one's dead yet.
10096676	10098417	The food was good.
10099737	10100378	Thank you.
10100678	10101358	Sorry, hairball.
10103119	10105700	Well, the food's gone, so it was eaten.
10107821	10110582	At best, it was at least tolerable if it's all gone.
10113658	10114899	And Jamie makes a sad face.
10115019	10116399	The eel was interesting.
10116439	10118720	I've never really had eel in that mass quantity before.
10118760	10119481	It was interesting.
10119521	10121962	I don't know if I necessarily like the fiber, but it was good.
10122042	10125163	I didn't even notice really it was eel, because I ate it with chicken, too.
10125403	10127244	Yeah, see, I had just straight up eel.
10127304	10130085	It was a little weird for me, but it was good.
10131066	10133267	Oh, well, maybe that's why.
10134454	10140298	It was good, though, and I appreciate Jamie's effort to cook for us because, you know, we're single and don't cook.
10140358	10140858	At least I don't.
10141018	10141278	Anyway.
10142619	10142879	Damn it.
10142919	10144961	I'm going to make sure you guys have proper nutrition.
10146962	10150164	You're eating instant rice and, like, super bacon.
10151184	10156408	You are going to... I haven't had super bacon in a good two weeks.
10156488	10159509	And still, I've seen what's in your fridge, and there's hardly anything in there.
10159970	10160930	What do you guys live off of?
10161070	10161731	Pop-Tarts?
10164671	10165252	Okay, Rob.
10166052	10167313	For one week, I challenge you.
10168954	10171196	You need to eat the same things that I do for a week.
10171316	10172337	Oh, give me a break.
10172977	10174818	What I eat is very, very easy.
10175279	10175819	Very easy.
10176460	10178421	You have to have a bowl of oatmeal in the morning.
10178661	10178841	Ew.
10179782	10180122	Okay.
10180142	10183505	Let me lick mud.
10184265	10184505	Okay.
10184565	10185946	Loki said, let me lick mud.
10187367	10193552	Maple, maples, the brown sugar and maple instant oatmeal is really good.
10194864	10196164	and Yoplait Yogurt is really good.
10196184	10198605	Oh, no, it's for old people.
10198625	10200225	Oh, no, it's for people who like to shit.
10201065	10201285	Wait.
10201545	10202646	Wait, you like to shit?
10203926	10204266	No.
10205266	10206687	It's TMI Radio.
10206787	10207247	No.
10208247	10213508	That's why old people eat it, but it's good for like your... It's fiber.
10213988	10214848	Fiber's good for you.
10215868	10222710	And then for lunch, you need to have like a microwave dinner because they're really good.
10223704	10225786	and veggie burgers for dinner every night.
10226726	10226927	Ew.
10227047	10227527	They're good.
10229048	10229769	Veggie cheeseburger.
10229889	10231710	I have veggie burgers for lunch.
10232571	10233231	Okay, that's good.
10233451	10235093	But see, one week.
10235833	10236193	One week.
10237174	10237795	No Pop-Tarts.
10239136	10240777	I actually, I don't eat Pop-Tarts, actually.
10240797	10241497	I don't like Pop-Tarts.
10241537	10247121	I usually have either a Nutri-Grain bar in the morning or, like, I won't eat breakfast until when I get to work on a bag of pretzels.
10247722	10248943	That's not good for you.
10249543	10251004	I try Nutri-Grain bars, though.
10251084	10251825	That's usually what I eat.
10257327	10263828	I have my super hot chocolate when I get to work.
10263888	10270070	It's three bags of hot chocolate concentrated and then I put a little bit of hot water in there so it's like super frothy.
10271490	10272190	That's all I eat.
10272490	10273871	Everything is super with you.
10275722	10276983	23rd Magazine would also like to know.
10277524	10277724	What?
10278244	10282087	The thing I used to have when I worked at this stupid temp agency that no longer exists in my universe.
10283108	10290834	I would have half a cup of super strong coffee and then pour the rest of it in hot chocolate and then throw in like five packs of sugar.
10291455	10293036	And that was what I would drink every morning.
10293056	10293737	That's healthy.
10293757	10295518	See, I don't drink that crap anymore.
10295598	10299201	I've been off of my soda now for a week, so I'm happy.
10299922	10300142	All right.
10302428	10307933	23rd Magus would like to also know Sky, that's me, could you give me my jokes back please?
10309234	10310054	What, all three of them?
10310274	10311936	Yeah, you wish you could be as cool as me.
10314057	10315538	Yeah, he has negative jokes now.
10316299	10320742	Campbell Soup, one of our new chatters, unless it's somebody who changed their name, I don't think so.
10321363	10324485	Campbell Soup would like to know, what's up with the foam on beer?
10326046	10326687	Good question.
10326747	10327828	It's what makes you fart.
10329369	10330870	Loki has a comment.
10333960	10336361	Why is beer better than women?
10337362	10337642	Why?
10338142	10340463	Because no matter how you pour it, you always have good head.
10347987	10348947	I did a magasism.
10352909	10354490	He doesn't tell R-rated jokes, though.
10356130	10357291	Why is there foam on beer?
10357591	10359232	It's just the way God made it, okay?
10359272	10361413	But all I have to say is don't drink beer, drink Guinness.
10363206	10365709	Beard tastes like... pee smells.
10366029	10371054	Foam is there to remind you that you're wasting your time, and if you want to get fucked up, just drink some hard liquor.
10371135	10375319	Go straight for the 151, or the Schlager, or Everclear.
10375479	10377321	Okay, alcohol recipe of the week.
10378022	10378803	Apple pie.
10378963	10381486	The foam is there to remind you that you're a pussy, you're drinking beer.
10382501	10386003	You get a big glass gallon jug of apple juice.
10386623	10388104	And then you pour it all out in another container.
10388784	10393987	And then you pour in about half a bottle of Everclear and let cinnamon sticks dissolve in it.
10395007	10397749	And then you pour in the apple juice and let it sit for like a couple days.
10398429	10401611	And you have apple pie.
10401751	10403812	23rd Magus says beer goes down easy.
10403932	10407774	And I'd like to know, is that the beer or the beer bottle in your case?
10408514	10409815	Beer is nasty.
10412975	10413656	Oh, I'm mean.
10415276	10415816	I'm so mean.
10415836	10416036	What?
10416056	10418157	Yours does smell nasty.
10418277	10418637	Okay.
10420898	10421798	Pip would like to know.
10421858	10422559	Oh, this is a good one.
10422599	10425239	And another new chatter, or at least a name I don't recognize.
10425299	10429121	Pip would like to know, how did the ferret get into the show?
10429741	10431001	Ferret's been here since day one.
10431321	10436023	Yeah, we've been throwing it around and having the ferrets rape each other.
10437203	10438124	Mad ferret sex.
10438564	10438844	Yeah.
10439657	10444221	Actually, ferret number one was a birthday gift to me from my old stalker.
10444802	10446744	And I just, I have all these stuffed animals.
10447044	10449706	Can you shut the goddamn thing up for one minute while I tell the story?
10449966	10451688	It's the ferret story, he's contributing.
10451748	10455852	We used to have, or I still do, I have all my stuffed animals on top of the computer.
10456272	10460716	Like, I know you can't really see it on the webcam, but there's all these stuffed animals that sit on top of the computer.
10460776	10463759	Like, Carmen, oh, Bradley's turning the thing over so you can see the stuffed animals.
10464019	10467921	We have like Cartman, and Pikachu, and like a little stuffed devil.
10468021	10470562	My happy birthday bear that Jamie got me, and all this stuff here.
10471242	10473823	Oh, it just went up to the cam, so there you go, you guys can look.
10475104	10480226	And the ferret used to sit there, and one day Jamie pulled it down and started pushing the button and learned that it'd make noises.
10480586	10483027	And behold, the show got worse.
10484349	10489030	And then Loki found a second ferret at some random store and he brought it over to some show a while back.
10489051	10491851	They sell them at Walgreens so everyone can have a ferret of their own.
10493552	10494272	God, no.
10497433	10497773	Alright.
10498673	10499274	Moving on.
10500994	10506636	HK Holly would like to know Can vegetarians eat animal crackers?
10507796	10509857	As long as they're not made out of animal parts.
10514040	10514980	That's an interesting question.
10515040	10516201	I would say yes, it's okay.
10516642	10519784	I think I know some vegetarians who do eat animal crackers.
10520204	10523747	Especially, you know what's good are those animal crackers with the frosting on them and the little balls.
10524107	10525668	The mother's crackers, you know what I'm talking about?
10525729	10526869	Oh yes, the mother's cookies.
10526889	10527990	Mother's animal cookies.
10528491	10529051	Those are the best.
10529071	10529551	Good shit.
10529792	10530312	Yes they are.
10530392	10532194	I wouldn't care if I was vegan, I'd still eat them.
10534135	10534956	They're so fattening though.
10534976	10537878	I'm just reminded of an old question.
10539499	10540440	Do vegans swallow?
10543030	10544592	Yes, and I know.
10545794	10546334	Oh, okay.
10546735	10547055	Too much.
10547075	10547976	I used to date a vegan.
10549738	10550059	Whale.
10553280	10553560	All right.
10553780	10558244	Oh, Tal says, as a vegetarian, he would just like to say, yes, he can eat animal cookies.
10558484	10558885	So there you go.
10558905	10559485	There's your question.
10559665	10561326	You learn something new on Orange Lounge Radio every day.
10562167	10564629	We're still accepting questions for Ask Orange Lounge, by the way.
10564669	10566991	Just send them over private message to Sky in the chat room.
10567732	10568712	No, we still have a few left.
10569153	10572455	Biohazard sent me plenty to get us through a whole other show.
10573576	10575298	www.caliabomani.com.
10575338	10576579	Click on Orange Lounge and click on chat.
10576599	10576839	All right.
10578021	10579861	Nostylan, oh god.
10580221	10580742	Here it is.
10580942	10582562	No, here it is.
10582902	10584202	It's actually a good question.
10585363	10585743	Here it is.
10586403	10589263	How come you guys don't play more Eurobeat?
10593764	10598985	I guess my theory would be because to a lot of people who don't know Eurobeat, it all sounds exactly the same.
10602026	10605727	Nostylan also says there should be a Bomani Eurobeat hour.
10606387	10606867	No!
10607904	10608924	God, no!
10609044	10610645	What the hell is wrong with you?
10612665	10614206	What was the question?
10614346	10616307	Why doesn't Orange Lounge Radio play more Eurobeat?
10617507	10618427	We can play more Eurobeat.
10618707	10620428	Jamie's done Eurobeat pre-shows.
10621008	10624329	I've done, like, hours of Eurobeat on my show, too.
10624469	10624829	You know what?
10624869	10626810	Tune into Jamie's show, because she's the biggest Eurobeat fan.
10626870	10629851	I did, like, a two-hour marathon of Eurobeat a couple weeks ago.
10630271	10630551	Yeah.
10631383	10631903	So you know what?
10631983	10634624	If you don't think we play enough Eurobeat, you're listening to the wrong shows.
10635084	10637205	Listen to Tuesday night's Pump Up the Volume.
10638825	10639085	Alright.
10640345	10641366	I am not vegan.
10641426	10642046	God no.
10642166	10643686	Like I have that kind of discipline.
10643746	10644466	One of my exes is.
10646107	10646427	Alright.
10647507	10650068	He made this really good eggplant stuff at a party at my house.
10650608	10653729	And nobody ate it but you and I. Well, I ate, like, lots of it.
10654169	10654429	It was good.
10654449	10654769	It was good.
10656118	10660947	John Fields would like to know, what do you call a river that's too big for its bridges?
10663291	10664514	You need to shut up right now.
10666579	10668461	That was the worst pun ever.
10669162	10671425	That was a pun straight out of 23rd Magus' book.
10671745	10673006	You owe Magus a quarter.
10673487	10674969	Give him a quarter for stealing the bill.
10674989	10676891	Pay them royalties and we'll stick the RIA on you.
10677011	10677611	Take it now.
10678352	10680234	We'll stick the RIA on you if you don't.
10680415	10682016	Nostylan has another question.
10682377	10682737	God.
10683939	10686762	What came first, the egg or the chicken?
10688337	10689418	Depends on your religion.
10689598	10695283	Well, in that sentence, the egg came first in your sentence, so... Yes, Loki.
10696424	10696904	Get a mic.
10701047	10706051	The chicken and egg rhetorical question is the dumbest thing ever because it's not actually a rhetorical question.
10706352	10708633	They did not specify what type of an egg it was.
10709094	10711316	Therefore, dinosaurs predated chickens.
10712156	10713557	Therefore, the egg came first.
10720959	10721740	That was deep.
10722641	10725583	That was deep like a puddle.
10726184	10730027	That was so deep.
10730287	10735592	Going back to Biohazard's questions, because that's all the questions we have left, unless people send more over private messages to Sky.
10736913	10738694	Do you think that it's safe?
10740436	10740656	No.
10741497	10742658	You're listening to the show, aren't you?
10745698	10748180	The chatroom's talking about their vegetarian stints.
10748680	10750602	I have actually had a vegetarian stint.
10750682	10752023	I was vegetarian for about a month.
10753224	10753764	You know what?
10754425	10755726	I want to bet doing it.
10755986	10764973	This is like, as of April, made two years that I've gone without beef or pork on a regular basis.
10765253	10768776	I've, you know, had a nibble now and then, but I've stayed off of it.
10770071	10773573	I would like to say I have not drank regular soda in about six months.
10774494	10776915	But I need to cut back on diet, though, because I do drink diet.
10776935	10777936	Diet is worse for you.
10778276	10780378	I haven't smoked a cigarette in four years.
10782599	10785281	You know, I haven't smoked a cigarette in five and a half years.
10785661	10787502	I haven't smoked a cigarette in a week.
10789364	10790404	You are so square.
10790424	10791985	I know, aren't I?
10792686	10792966	All right.
10795837	10799681	Biohazard would also like to know, why haven't I heard any ferrets yet?
10799721	10800521	Did you burn them?
10800842	10801863	Obviously we have not.
10801923	10803484	Those fucking ferrets won't go away.
10804866	10805787	Thanks, thanks.
10806748	10809050	Here's a somewhat serious question from Biohazard.
10809070	10811833	Biohazard would like to know, why can't we vote for Holic?
10813047	10814928	Because we said so, and we are the authority.
10815008	10817209	Because I have the real answer to the question.
10817769	10820010	Holic is already in rotation on the station.
10820090	10824151	Therefore, if you vote for it, you're voting a song into rotation that's already in rotation.
10824211	10824691	You rhymed, Rob.
10824711	10825832	You don't need to vote for Holic.
10826212	10827192	You rhymed, Rob.
10827372	10827873	I rhymed.
10828053	10828273	I'm great.
10828293	10829773	Rotation on the station.
10830073	10832354	Rotation on the station on Orzhov Radio.
10832394	10833415	It's like a Eurobeat song.
10836116	10838337	Now you sound like you're spitting on the microphone.
10841298	10842578	It's just that calendar song.
10844159	10851001	What is the meaning of... Oh, Biohazard also wants to know, what is the meaning of life expressed through interpretive dance in front of the webcam?
10851221	10851761	Forty-two.
10854882	10855322	Hold on.
10855482	10858103	In about ten seconds, I'm going to show you.
10858123	10861584	The next webcam image, I will be showing you the meaning of life.
10862344	10865285	And I will be getting help from the others, showing you the meaning of life.
10865325	10865906	There it goes.
10866686	10866986	Four...
10869622	10872423	The meaning of life is up there on our cam for you to see.
10873683	10874243	Right now.
10877705	10879906	Alright.
10879946	10881686	I got your meaning of life.
10883587	10887369	His last question is, why do I ask so many questions?
10888069	10888809	Because you suck.
10890430	10892070	No way, he answered his own questions.
10893111	10894171	This is the meaning of life.
10899897	10902459	Wait, wait, wait, he answered his own question, never mind.
10902899	10905581	That was what I was going to say too, except I've been to more Volker.
10906242	10907442	I think it skipped the picture.
10907462	10909644	It's not there.
10911145	10913707	Oh, bummer.
10913887	10917369	23rd Magus, I'd like to know, will you people stop fucking stealing my jokes?
10917489	10918870	Puns are my department, bitches.
10919150	10919731	Hey, you know what?
10919751	10920631	Where's the meaning of life?
10920671	10923193	Did you write the information for Max 2?
10923493	10924194	I don't think so.
10924434	10925675	Did you write the information screens for that?
10925715	10926135	I don't think so.
10926155	10927596	Therefore, you suck at puns.
10930194	10933057	Nurse Stylin would like to know, how many sounds does the ferret have?
10933157	10933938	About seven.
10935559	10937081	And we don't need to hear them all.
10938082	10939183	Look at the webcam right now.
10939804	10945229	John Fields would like to know, any interest in any of the games that are being shown at Tokyo Game Show?
10945890	10948773	Um... Well, DDR Party Edition, I guess.
10948793	10948833	Um...
10954387	10956410	Otherwise, I don't really give a shit, I find.
10957011	10957551	You know what?
10957631	10958733	We'll see them when we see them.
10959153	10960575	Who cares if they're coming out in Tokyo?
10960595	10961256	We need them out here.
10961316	10964319	Because say this really great role-playing game comes out in Japan.
10964399	10964800	Guess what?
10964860	10965581	It's in Japanese.
10965641	10966221	It doesn't matter.
10966442	10967183	I can't read it.
10968384	10970727	Hey, but if they put out another Grandia, I'll import it.
10976641	10976801	No.
10977661	10978001	Alright.
10979522	10982963	Biohazard would also like to know, am I infamous for my bad questions yet?
10983903	10984403	Actually, no.
10984423	10986623	You just kind of act stupid to us.
10988404	10991045	You sure are famous.
10991165	10995206	23rd Magus would like to know, is it true that Jason Enos asked for my help in writing the info screens?
10995726	10996546	No, you made that up.
10999088	11001049	Alright, let's close up the mailbag.
11001089	11002669	Thank you everybody for playing Ask Orange Lounge.
11002689	11004730	You know what we haven't looked at in a long time, Rob?
11005070	11005290	Sorry.
11005310	11006210	Our actual mail.
11006751	11007131	Hold on.
11009872	11012893	Now we're done with Ask Orange Lounge Radio.
11013433	11016534	We hope you learned something tonight on Ask Orange Lounge Radio.
11017194	11018435	Hey, guess what next week?
11018975	11024037	The ferrets won't be here because I'm going to go outside and run them over with my car.
11027298	11027498	Alright.
11031377	11037321	Let's see if... I'm just hoping the batteries fucking die someday.
11038522	11039843	As are half our listeners, I'm sure.
11040383	11040704	Okay.
11041384	11043706	The show would not be the same without the ferret.
11043726	11045347	The ferret is our mascot.
11048049	11053552	Yeah, we're actually checking our actual email address at orangeloungeradio, all one word, at yahoo.com.
11053572	11055214	And we have two new messages, it looks like.
11055614	11056534	And it's spam.
11056554	11056935	Yeah.
11058556	11059056	Let's see.
11059417	11060637	Yahoo Education.
11060757	11062018	Advance your learning goals.
11062078	11064499	Yahoo Education introduces courses and degrees.
11066661	11068121	SBC Yahoo DSL.
11068181	11070983	Hey, only $29.95 a month for fast internet access.
11071023	11071783	Isn't it about time?
11073824	11075666	Then we have something in our bulk message, too.
11076206	11081849	Oh, we have a message that says, Would you like to submit something to our SubmitWW.com service?
11081909	11084310	You know, because not enough people listen to Orange Launch Radio.
11084330	11085351	I guess this bitch knows that.
11087662	11089404	All right, so that's all we have in our mailbag.
11089444	11096810	If you'd like to fill up our mailbag, orangeloungeradioatyahoo.com All right, we have some more Ask Orange Lounge questions.
11096850	11098471	I'm taking these last three, and that's it.
11098671	11100853	We're finishing this bit, and we're ending the show.
11101093	11102254	Here's some fair to ask for you.
11102294	11106258	Biohazard wants to know, what was the date of the first Orange Lounge radio show?
11106778	11109000	The date of the first live show was June 23, 2002.
11114145	11119391	The station first went on air, I think, May 18th of that year.
11119471	11121313	May 18th or 22nd, somewhere in there.
11122874	11124016	The first live show was June 23rd, 2002.
11128572	11130133	23rd Magus didn't have a question, he just had a comment.
11130793	11133934	Nostylan wants to know, when will there be another Pimpin' Hoes party?
11133994	11143338	I guess he's referring to my birthday party, which he wasn't at, so I don't know how he knows this, but I think someone he talks to a lot was part of the brains behind that party.
11144159	11146159	Maybe for someone else's birthday, I don't know.
11148620	11151421	Maybe for my next birthday, I'd love to have another Pimpin' Hoes party.
11152242	11152582	No, Dirac.
11154085	11158846	A Pimino's party, it was my birthday, and some folks came over here on a Sunday morning and surprised me.
11159306	11161267	And they all dressed like hoes and pimps.
11161287	11162307	They brought over cake.
11162667	11171550	And it was kind of like a Hawaiian Pimps and Hoes party, actually, because they were wearing Hawaiian coconut boobs and little lays, colored rainbow lays and stuff.
11171570	11172050	And it was fun.
11172530	11173690	And we had chicken and waffles.
11174310	11176271	We had Eggos and Popeye's chicken.
11177611	11180392	By the way, live on the webcam, the ferret eats Loki's head.
11180512	11180872	Hooray.
11183317	11184677	Alright guys, guess what?
11184717	11187418	It's time to wrap up the show.
11188558	11193359	Thank God this week's show went okay, unlike last week's show, which we're writing off and forgetting about forever.
11193719	11196960	It's time for me to go around and collect the final thoughts.
11197360	11198460	Let's start with Bradley.
11199140	11200081	Does he have a microphone over there?
11201301	11201641	Jamie.
11205382	11206902	Have you ever really looked at your toes?
11207122	11207902	They look weird.
11208983	11209543	Yeah, they do.
11210463	11211043	They do look weird.
11213843	11216144	I'm not Asian, and I don't know how to use chopsticks.
11216885	11217565	Thank you, Puppy.
11218106	11218366	Erin.
11219626	11223829	Uh, thanks to me, Puppy has now learned how to pick up Mike and Ike candies with his chopsticks.
11224669	11225670	But I'm still not Asian.
11226691	11230333	We realize that, but now you're one step closer to being Asian!
11230453	11230933	Woohoo!
11231734	11237177	I actually like that one.
11238177	11239398	Loki, your final thought.
11239698	11240459	I solder.
11245347	11245648	Great.
11247412	11254688	My final thought is I hope I don't decide to flake on the show next week because the Castro Street Fair does sound tempting.
11256058	11257779	What, on Sunday?
11258019	11258239	Yeah.
11258940	11260341	I'm thinking about flaking on the show, but I don't know.
11260361	11261722	Don't worry, I'll fill in your part.
11262102	11262442	We'll see.
11263002	11263323	We'll see.
11263663	11264964	I can... We'll see.
11265104	11267645	I can fill in all your parts on the show.
11267925	11268326	Whoa!
11268386	11268686	Whoa!
11269026	11269426	Whoa!
11270527	11270927	No!
11270987	11273109	All your voice parts, you retard!
11273209	11274690	Freaking... I don't need that.
11275150	11277011	That's the other Matt that wants to fill those parts.
11277211	11277811	Whoa!
11278932	11281174	Um, Holly says, puppy needs to do a hula dance.
11281194	11281634	Ice Princess.
11281654	11282554	I say no.
11287670	11288791	Jamie, your final thought?
11289631	11291813	I'm having way too much fun with the webcam.
11293654	11299256	The final word of the show, I'm going to give it to Bradley because he never talks and I want him to give the final word tonight.
11299877	11300717	Terraforming.
11302663	11305044	You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
11305484	11309386	Orange Lounge Radio is hosted by DarkSakura, Sky, and Loki.
11309767	11311627	We expect you a nice play again.
11312108	11314909	And now, here's your fortune cookie message of the day.
11315830	11316250	Pardon me.
11317110	11317791	Now it begins.
11318291	11319792	Who all here is evil?
11319912	11320472	Sound off!
11320892	11321752	I'm evil.
11322053	11322733	I'm evil!
11322933	11323974	No, you are not.
11324354	11325935	Oh, I am too!
11326155	11328576	You're as harmless as a baby's...
11330853	11331454	Zorak?
11331634	11332395	Well, he is.
11332715	11334136	I'm not a baby's butt.
11334316	11337599	Brack, I'm going to have to go with Zorak on this one.
11337859	11341041	You simply don't have the mental capacity to be evil.
11341402	11341982	See?
11342282	11343223	I don't get it.
11343363	11347406	You see, Brack, you have to be able to come up with, oh, say, plots against the universe.
11347586	11352330	You have to hatch evil plans to conquer planets and be just plain mean most of the time.
11352650	11354792	You're just too nice.
11355152	11356653	I forget how to be mean.
11356693	11359574	That radiation half-lobotomized me.
11359634	11361655	Hey, I've got an idea.
11362375	11365617	Let Zorak teach you how to be mean.
11366017	11366797	Oh, man.
11367317	11368218	Do I have to?
11368278	11369859	Yes, you have to.
11369999	11370619	Okay, Bragg.
11370939	11371839	Repeat after me.
11372480	11373540	Space ghost.
11373560	11374841	Space ghost.
11375341	11377222	I will destroy you.
11377522	11380163	I will destroy you, if you don't mind.
11380583	11382424	I will destroy you.
11382744	11383304	Oh, I'm sorry.
11383345	11384045	Wait, I'll get it.
11384785	11385846	I will destroy you.
11386246	11388508	I will destroy you.
11388528	11391450	All right, I will destroy you.
11391550	11394052	You and your little dog, too.
11394212	11396914	You and your little dog.
11396934	11400396	Hey, I like this dog.
11400697	11402798	Francine is a good puppy.
11402878	11403419	No.
11404179	11405319	That was just a prank.
11405359	11407380	You want to hurt Francine?
11407800	11412501	You're a big, bad, green, um, thingy guy.
11412561	11412981	Bug.
11413121	11416501	Bug, I don't want you to hurt Francine.
11417041	11419842	Spacecoach, shoot that thingy thing on your arm.
11419882	11421322	Destructo Ray.
11421342	11424563	Destructo Ray so he doesn't hurt Francine.
11424603	11425463	Gladly, Brack.
11425663	11427063	My dear old chum.
11430204	11430744	Hey!
11431525	11432986	What'd you do that for?
11433346	11435707	That was for Francine!
11436848	11437909	Hey, wait, I don't have a dog.
11438189	11440190	Yeah.
11440230	11441331	Tell me about it.
11445233	11447354	Thanks for listening, and we'll see you next week.
11477464	11477884	All right.
11477944	11479546	We're in the Orange Launch Radio after birth.
11479646	11481527	As promised, we won't make you wait any longer.
11481587	11482588	Here it is one more time.
11482989	11483469	Overloaded.
11483929	11484370	Lesson two.
11587893	11592918	Okay, we're going to be adding that song into a rotation, by the way, on Orange Lounge Radio's Bomani Music and More program.
11592938	11596802	So if you like that and can't get enough of it, don't worry, you'll get to hear more very soon.
11597562	11599404	Welcome to the Orange Lounge Radio Afterbirth.
11600325	11603248	You are a scary woman, Miss Erin, with your whip.
11604148	11606130	When's going to be another tournament where you can beat me up?
11608012	11608753	I don't know, there hasn't...
11609670	11613833	Well, if you have to choose any time soon, she'll probably end up being there, so I'll try her there.
11614274	11614874	Yeah, probably.
11614914	11620458	Well, see, the thing is, there haven't been any real good NorCal tournaments coming out.
11620498	11631547	You know, after the last year barrage of tournaments, it was kind of tired out, and now it's just, well... I'm kind of sad that I heard about the tournament in Nickel City today.
11631927	11634609	They were having a Puzzle Fire tournament, and only one person showed up.
11635370	11635850	Oh, man.
11635910	11636731	I played him today and beat him.
11638432	11639333	No, did you go?
11639870	11643612	No, I played, you know, what's his name that was going to be there?
11644312	11645053	I forget his name.
11646213	11649535	But anyways, yeah, so we played him and I won.
11650115	11651516	Because he made a mistake.
11652737	11656719	But it was, I don't know, I think it would have been cool to have a Puzzle Fighter tournament.
11656759	11661861	Because I know people in the Bay Area are pretty hardcore in that stuff.
11661941	11664903	But I don't know how a DDR tournament is going to work out too well there.
11667610	11667991	All right.
11668471	11670333	Anything else we want to share on the afterbirth?
11670573	11671454	Jamie, have anything?
11674698	11678141	Go to www.fanamatrix.net.
11678241	11679062	They have a pretty cool...
11681335	11682357	Well, go to BitTorrent.
11682377	11683318	They have BitTorrent links.
11684620	11687724	Anyways, they have BitTorrent links for the movie.
11688105	11695915	It's a 10-minute or about 10-minute fan film that's done by professional actors, professional stuntmen, special effects and whatnot, cinematography.
11695975	11697618	There's kind of like a practice movie for them.
11698218	11726377	and no fan movie and it's basically a bunch of New Zealand actors you know doing this kind of prequel to The Matrix and it's pretty sweet so you should go check that out they're talking about doing sequels and stuff later on but it's the first movie is called Phantom Matrix and it's called Run Program and it's pretty cool so that's www.phantomatrix.net and yeah
11729335	11734224	Alright, I think that's going to wrap up the afterbirth, unless anyone else has something they want to say?
11734344	11735586	I will destroy you!
11736027	11736468	Thank you.
11736568	11737530	Jamie, come in.
11737750	11740755	I've got lint in my eye and it hurts.
11741417	11741817	Okay, bye.
11743041	11744162	All right, until next week.
11744202	11744602	Thanks, you guys.
11744682	11748706	As I promised way in the beginning of the show, we're going to do the Night Style soundtrack.
11748966	11752289	Just a random order, you guys, so hopefully the song you want will come up soon.
11754871	11755712	Good night, you guys.
11756132	11758074	Thanks for supporting Orange Lounge Radio as always.
11758114	11758875	We really appreciate it.
11758915	11760076	We'd be nothing without you.
11767660	11768441	Thanks for watching!
11838200	11839005	Thanks for watching!
11929218	11931888	Come on baby, move it up, now you're home to get your magic shot.
11962702	11964203	I gotta give it to you tonight
11993061	11993942	Listen to my heartbeat
12106412	12107877	I'm leading a new evolution.
12158649	12159512	Thanks for watching!
