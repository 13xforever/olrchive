WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:03.000
Don't even get a lousy copy of our home game.

00:03.000 --> 00:07.000
You're a complete loser!

00:07.000 --> 00:11.000
Don't know what I was thinking of.

00:11.000 --> 00:15.000
I guess I just wasn't too bright.

00:15.000 --> 00:20.000
Well, I sure hope I do better

00:20.000 --> 00:23.000
next weekend on The Price is Right.

00:23.000 --> 00:24.000
Aight, aight.

00:24.000 --> 00:29.000
I love some Jeopardy, baby.

00:29.000 --> 00:36.000
I lost on Jeopardy, baby

00:36.000 --> 00:45.000
I lost on Jeopardy, baby

01:06.000 --> 01:25.000
Rock the cradle of love, rock the cradle of love, yes the cradle of love, don't rock easy

01:25.000 --> 01:27.000
it's true.

01:27.000 --> 01:29.000
I rock the cradle of love

01:29.000 --> 01:32.000
I rock the cradle of love

01:32.000 --> 01:34.000
Yes, the cradle of love

01:34.000 --> 01:38.000
Don't rock easy, it's true

01:49.000 --> 01:52.000
The love shack is a little old place where

01:52.000 --> 01:55.000
We can dance together

01:55.000 --> 01:59.000
Love Shack Baby, Love Shack Baby, Love Shack

02:05.000 --> 02:09.000
Pump up the jam, pump up the jam, pump up the jam, pump it up

02:09.000 --> 02:14.000
Set me in the corner, set me in the spot light

02:14.000 --> 02:20.000
Losing my religion, trying to keep a view

02:20.000 --> 02:24.000
And I don't know if I can do it

02:24.000 --> 02:26.000
Oh no!

02:26.000 --> 02:28.000
I said too much

02:28.000 --> 02:30.000
I haven't said enough

02:32.000 --> 02:34.000
The things you say

02:34.000 --> 02:36.000
Your purple bro just gives you away the things you say

02:36.000 --> 02:38.000
You're unbelievable

02:44.000 --> 02:46.000
Do me baby

02:46.000 --> 02:48.000
Do me baby

02:48.000 --> 02:50.000
You can do me in the morning

02:50.000 --> 02:52.000
You can do me in the night

02:52.000 --> 02:53.000
When you wanna do me

02:53.000 --> 02:54.000
You're the lady who

02:54.000 --> 02:56.000
Every night

02:57.000 --> 02:59.000
Enter night

03:00.000 --> 03:02.000
Take my hand

03:02.000 --> 03:04.000
Off to Never Never Land

03:14.000 --> 03:18.000
The Humpty Dance is your chance to do the hump

03:19.000 --> 03:20.000
Do me baby

03:20.000 --> 03:29.000
Do the Humpty Humpty, do the Humpty Humpty Do me baby, do the Humpty Humpty Come on and do the Humpty Humpty

03:29.000 --> 03:37.000
She's mine, cherry pie Put a smile on your face, ten miles wide It looks so good, make a grown man cry

03:37.000 --> 03:40.000
The sweet cherry pie, yi, yi

03:40.000 --> 03:41.000
Whoo!

03:41.000 --> 03:43.000
Drum solo!

03:50.000 --> 03:51.000
I miss you much

03:51.000 --> 03:52.000
M-O-I miss you much

03:52.000 --> 03:53.000
I really miss you much

03:53.000 --> 03:55.000
M-I-S-S you much

03:55.000 --> 03:56.000
I miss you much

03:56.000 --> 03:58.000
M-O-I miss you much

03:58.000 --> 04:00.000
I really miss you much

04:00.000 --> 04:01.000
Hey!

04:01.000 --> 04:03.000
I don't want anybody else

04:03.000 --> 04:06.000
When I think about you I touch myself

04:06.000 --> 04:11.000
I don't want anybody else, oh no, oh no, oh no, no, no!

04:11.000 --> 04:14.000
He's the one they call Dr. Feelgood!

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
He's the one that makes you feel alright!

04:16.000 --> 04:19.000
He's the one they call Dr. Feelgood!

04:19.000 --> 04:21.000
He's gonna be your Frankenstein!

04:21.000 --> 04:22.000
Let's kick it!

04:24.000 --> 04:25.000
If you got a problem, go!

04:25.000 --> 04:27.000
I'll solve it, check out the beat while the DJ revolves it!

04:27.000 --> 04:29.000
Ice Ice Baby!

04:30.000 --> 04:31.000
Ice Ice Baby!

04:31.000 --> 04:32.000
We're just your mother!

04:32.000 --> 04:34.000
Ice Ice Baby!

04:34.000 --> 04:40.000
Eyes, eyes, baby, forever, I'll be your eyes!

04:40.000 --> 04:47.000
Eyes, eyes, baby, eyes, eyes, baby, eyes, eyes, baby

04:49.000 --> 04:51.000
Hey!

04:51.000 --> 05:16.240
You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio, the Monty Talk and then some.

05:16.240 --> 05:18.840
Mostly the and then some part of that.

05:18.840 --> 05:22.840
Orange Lounge Radio is created by a bunch of potty-mouthed adults.

05:22.840 --> 05:28.840
Orange Lounge may contain sexual, perverted, and mildly retarded content.

05:28.840 --> 05:32.840
You probably shouldn't let your children listen to Orange Lounge Radio.

05:32.840 --> 05:34.840
Yes, I will spank your child.

05:34.840 --> 05:36.840
If you're not going to do your job, goddammit, I will.

05:41.840 --> 05:43.840
Well, here's to my big opening.

05:43.840 --> 05:44.840
A sphincter says what?

05:44.840 --> 05:46.840
I'm super. Thanks for asking.

05:46.840 --> 05:49.840
Oh, you little bitch troll from hell.

05:49.840 --> 05:51.840
What am I doing here?

05:51.840 --> 05:53.840
No.

05:53.840 --> 05:54.840
Dodge this.

05:54.840 --> 05:55.840
Mm-hmm.

05:55.840 --> 05:57.840
This is a tasty burger.

05:57.840 --> 05:59.840
Look, you stupid bastard, you've got no arms left.

05:59.840 --> 06:00.840
Yes, I have.

06:00.840 --> 06:02.840
Look, there's a flesh wound.

06:02.840 --> 06:05.840
Searching for a boy in high school is that useless.

06:05.840 --> 06:09.840
It's searching for meaning in a polished shoreline.

06:09.840 --> 06:10.840
Oh, yeah?

06:10.840 --> 06:14.840
Well, I hope your babies look like monkeys.

06:14.840 --> 06:15.840
Dark sacra.

06:15.840 --> 06:34.840
We are live and this is episode number.59 for September the 7th of 2003.

06:34.840 --> 06:39.840
I made a 5-9 joke.

06:39.840 --> 06:45.040
You're tuned into the Be Monnie Scene's most glompy radio station of all things Be Monnie.

06:45.040 --> 06:48.300
My name is Rob Roberts, and you might know me as Skye.

06:48.300 --> 06:52.560
Joining me, as always, are my awesome co-hosts in this corner, the happiest bunny on the

06:52.560 --> 06:54.120
farm, Miss Jamie Sommers.

06:54.120 --> 06:56.520
I want a nap.

06:56.520 --> 07:01.320
You know her better as Dark Sakura, or today it's Nappy Sakura.

07:01.320 --> 07:03.320
She needs to take a nap.

07:03.320 --> 07:04.320
What?

07:04.320 --> 07:05.320
You don't like me.

07:05.320 --> 07:06.320
It's Baby Sakura.

07:06.320 --> 07:07.320
You bite me.

07:07.320 --> 07:08.320
You changed my diaper.

07:08.320 --> 07:13.320
I'm going to kick your ass in a moment.

07:13.320 --> 07:15.320
I'm gonna kick your ass in a moment.

07:15.320 --> 07:17.320
I'll be contagious if you watch.

07:17.320 --> 07:19.320
It's Angry Baby Sakura.

07:19.320 --> 07:23.320
In that corner, say hello to our tech master, Loki.

07:23.320 --> 07:24.320
Hello.

07:24.320 --> 07:29.320
Also with us tonight, we have...

07:29.320 --> 07:30.320
Air.

07:30.320 --> 07:31.320
Nobody.

07:31.320 --> 07:32.320
No, we have air.

07:32.320 --> 07:33.320
We have air.

07:33.320 --> 07:34.320
We have particles.

07:34.320 --> 07:38.320
See, if I'd had that song chewed up, I could have played air and made another funny Bomani

07:38.320 --> 07:40.320
joke, like two jokes in 60 seconds.

07:40.320 --> 07:47.560
We have germs and and other single-celled organisms. We are not alone and a part of mine in the back of the room and

07:48.600 --> 07:54.000
By making those super my jokes in a row you would have qualified for the quota for us to kill you

07:56.520 --> 07:58.520
I'm so excited

08:00.800 --> 08:04.560
You have the microphone you know what one of them I think

08:04.560 --> 08:18.000
We'll have to go on a parrot hunt later.

08:18.000 --> 08:20.560
You're going to hunt to save it and I'm going to hunt to kill it.

08:20.560 --> 08:26.000
I'll just make you smell my shoe.

08:26.000 --> 08:27.000
We'll be back.

08:27.000 --> 08:31.760
We're a little dead tonight so it's going to be an interesting show.

08:31.760 --> 08:38.760
the

08:41.260 --> 08:43.800
right up

08:43.800 --> 08:47.160
the

08:47.160 --> 08:48.880
and happy

08:48.880 --> 08:51.360
looking for evil

08:51.360 --> 08:52.920
i'm feeling kind of

08:52.920 --> 08:59.920
i'm feeling tired too i've done nothing but really now like all week long

08:59.920 --> 09:06.240
I love that sound, it makes me go squeak.

09:06.240 --> 09:09.240
We'll be back, we have a little bit of reminding news to talk about tonight, it's somewhat

09:09.240 --> 09:11.760
exciting and we have other junk to talk about too.

09:11.760 --> 09:17.560
I know Dark Sackers got an exciting story and I have boring ones to tell so we'll do

09:17.560 --> 09:20.280
some story telling when we come back from break.

09:20.280 --> 09:26.760
My pre-show thing there is sort of a hint.

09:26.760 --> 09:30.280
An Arcadian, I'm with you right there, I feel you.

09:30.280 --> 09:33.380
We'll be back after this appropriate break.

14:00.280 --> 14:18.640
So many times with these brains So many people see what's high

14:18.640 --> 14:27.640
I'm setting off like the sky Keep it real all the way to the light

14:27.640 --> 14:29.040
I'm sure they don't fight in the sky

14:29.040 --> 14:30.440
Keep it real or they'll make it live

14:30.440 --> 14:31.940
And I'll party people and survive

14:31.940 --> 14:33.540
This is your life, little key gang

14:33.540 --> 14:35.140
Look at her, and she ain't with the pain

14:35.140 --> 14:37.140
So pump your fists, yeah

14:54.140 --> 14:55.140
Come on

14:55.140 --> 14:55.940
Nico, meow

14:55.940 --> 14:56.740
Meow meow

14:56.740 --> 15:00.740
Nico meow Nico meow meow meow

15:01.940 --> 15:04.780
This randomness could only be brought to you by orange lounge

15:09.020 --> 15:11.020
Hello everybody and welcome back to

15:11.420 --> 15:13.220
orange lounge radio

15:13.220 --> 15:18.620
and that's that you heard 0.59 appropriate because this is the 59th show of orange launch radio and

15:19.540 --> 15:23.340
Yamato with 2002 does that mean we're heavenly?

15:23.340 --> 15:28.940
This show is heavenly, except we're all going to hell.

15:28.940 --> 15:30.940
I made a joke.

15:30.940 --> 15:31.940
Yay.

15:31.940 --> 15:34.940
Ten Goku joke.

15:34.940 --> 15:39.180
And I was going to make it an all-numbers set, but Jamie really wanted to hear Ninzaburrow,

15:39.180 --> 15:42.420
and that didn't sound like such a bad idea, so you had a couple numbered songs and then

15:42.420 --> 15:46.420
Ninzaburrow.

15:46.420 --> 15:47.420
Ninzaburrow is cool.

15:47.420 --> 15:48.420
Yeah.

15:48.420 --> 15:51.060
I'm still trying to find episodes of the show.

15:51.060 --> 15:53.100
It sounded a little fast to you, huh?

15:53.100 --> 15:54.100
Yeah.

15:54.100 --> 15:57.560
You know, I think the song is just really, it is a lot faster and a lot of people remember

15:57.560 --> 16:04.620
because it seems like in DDR, they started to just double the speed of arrows on songs

16:04.620 --> 16:09.960
that weren't necessarily that big a tempo like, I don't know, Max 300.

16:09.960 --> 16:15.320
And especially in fourth mix, remember how fast dropout seemed in fourth mix?

16:15.320 --> 16:17.640
Because dropout was like the Max 300 of its time, right?

16:17.640 --> 16:20.960
It was just like, oh my God, the arrows are coming up so fast.

16:20.960 --> 16:29.360
you go and you play dropout on max 2 or something, you're like, oh this is easy. Dropout's easy.

16:29.360 --> 16:34.080
It's weird how much that frame rate totally changed things. So I think that's why Ninzaburro

16:34.080 --> 16:40.200
maybe, well then again of course that goes reverse my philosophy because Ninzaburro would

16:40.200 --> 16:44.600
have played faster, I don't know. Well I guess it depends if you played it on 4th or 5th

16:44.600 --> 16:50.560
because fifth mix is when the frame rate started to change so I don't know I'm

16:50.560 --> 16:57.240
talking myself into a corner here help hi hi so um as we usually like to start

16:57.240 --> 17:01.880
off the show we're gonna ask everybody how their week and their day was so

17:01.880 --> 17:06.440
we'll start with Jamie because it kind of relates to the pre-show so the

17:06.440 --> 17:10.600
beginning of the week was okay well it was really good because that's when

17:10.600 --> 17:17.380
Ma and Chan and Rick were here, and had a very good time.

17:17.380 --> 17:23.480
The air conditioner went out, though, on Sunday night, or during the day on Sunday, and it

17:23.480 --> 17:29.500
was out Monday and it was out Tuesday and it was out Wednesday, and it was really hot

17:29.500 --> 17:30.500
on Wednesday.

17:30.500 --> 17:35.060
I went to work and I was feeling just wretched, but I made it through my day at work, I mean

17:35.060 --> 17:36.060
sorry, Tuesday.

17:36.060 --> 17:39.900
I went back to work and I was feeling really crappy.

17:39.900 --> 17:43.220
I went to work Wednesday and was feeling even worse.

17:43.220 --> 17:47.980
And then when I went into work Thursday, I don't remember the entire drive to work, and

17:47.980 --> 17:48.980
that's not a good sign.

17:48.980 --> 17:51.780
You didn't fall asleep during the drive, did you?

17:51.780 --> 17:52.780
I don't know.

17:52.780 --> 17:55.420
I don't remember.

17:55.420 --> 17:59.260
I was having bad dizzy spells, and finally I asked if I could go home.

17:59.260 --> 18:00.460
I was not feeling good at all.

18:00.460 --> 18:02.820
I was running a fever.

18:02.820 --> 18:08.820
I remember driving home, but I had dizzy spells on the way home, which, good thing there was

18:08.820 --> 18:15.300
light traffic, so I got home and scheduled myself, and everyone knows me, I don't go

18:15.300 --> 18:19.820
to the doctor unless I have to, and I scheduled myself an appointment for the doctor that

18:19.820 --> 18:25.460
night, and it turns out that I have a respiratory infection and an ear infection in my right

18:25.460 --> 18:26.460
ear.

18:26.460 --> 18:29.260
I am no longer contagious, which is good for you guys.

18:29.260 --> 18:30.260
That's a very good sign, thank you.

18:30.260 --> 18:35.100
Because I've been on antibiotics now all weekend, I'm going to be on antibiotics for the rest

18:35.100 --> 18:37.100
of the week after that.

18:37.100 --> 18:48.940
I'm on this stuff that I have to put up my nose and squirt and it burns.

18:48.940 --> 18:51.420
It smells like burning.

18:51.420 --> 18:57.780
And I'm on my inhaler again for a buterol, which I was supposed to get six refills of

18:57.780 --> 19:00.540
it and I only got like zero.

19:00.540 --> 19:04.700
So I'm going to have to make sure that it wasn't my doctor's doctor handwriting, which

19:04.700 --> 19:11.900
is basic doctor handwriting.

19:11.900 --> 19:20.660
I was feeling a lot better, though, on Friday after sleeping for about 15 hours, and did

19:20.660 --> 19:23.880
my thing that day.

19:23.880 --> 19:31.260
Yesterday though, I got up at the butt crack of dawn, which is about 10 in the morning

19:31.260 --> 19:37.620
for me and made it over to Iguana Girl's house and a bunch of us all went to see Weird Al

19:37.620 --> 19:38.620
in Madera.

19:38.620 --> 19:39.620
How's Moo doing?

19:39.620 --> 19:41.820
Moo is so cute.

19:41.820 --> 19:44.180
Moo got a big belly.

19:44.180 --> 19:49.540
Moo is Iguana Girl's Iguana.

19:49.540 --> 19:54.180
We have a regular chatter named Moo and we have a Mooheimer.

19:54.180 --> 19:55.340
This is Moo the Cute.

19:55.340 --> 19:56.340
There's lots of Moos.

19:56.340 --> 19:59.500
Moo the Cute Iguana.

19:59.500 --> 20:01.180
And Moo was being antsy all day.

20:01.180 --> 20:09.980
It was being a little butt, but that's okay because Moo is cute.

20:09.980 --> 20:16.900
Melody came with us, which was really awesome, but we all went and hung around at the crappy

20:16.900 --> 20:17.900
fair.

20:17.900 --> 20:20.140
It was kind of fun for being a crap fair.

20:20.140 --> 20:25.300
My reaction to seeing the fair was, that's it, so we went to IHOP instead, and I tell

20:25.300 --> 20:30.740
you the IHOP was the happiest place on earth, Dethro and Disneyland, because there was happy

20:30.740 --> 20:34.240
everywhere, it looks like happy. Well, certainly this week anyway. Did you hear about what

20:34.240 --> 20:40.920
happened to Disneyland? That's pretty damn funny. And we were talking about it too. We

20:40.920 --> 20:44.300
were talking about it on the trip and we think it's just because the guy was doing something

20:44.300 --> 20:52.100
stupid because he was up in the front. We think that he was trying to get into the train.

20:52.100 --> 20:55.040
Like he was trying to jump from the train into another one or something? No, trying

20:55.040 --> 20:59.040
I'm trying to get into the front part.

20:59.040 --> 21:04.040
The train derailed and got jammed in the tunnel, then all the cars going that fast smashed into it.

21:04.040 --> 21:05.040
Oh.

21:05.040 --> 21:06.040
That's what happened.

21:06.040 --> 21:08.040
I still think it's that guy's fault.

21:08.040 --> 21:11.040
Let's just blame it on stupidity.

21:11.040 --> 21:16.040
It's a little kid who threw gum on a track or something like that.

21:16.040 --> 21:18.040
Even better, let's blame it on a little kid.

21:18.040 --> 21:19.040
Stupid children.

21:19.040 --> 21:24.040
That child is a murderer and should be hung.

21:24.040 --> 21:33.040
Whoa, that's kind of neat in the chatroom. It looks a little curvy. It looks like a big nose, like Mario's nose or something.

21:33.040 --> 21:34.040
What?

21:34.040 --> 21:38.040
I was looking at the curve that the text took in the chatroom. It was kind of neat looking.

21:38.040 --> 21:39.040
Okay.

21:39.040 --> 21:40.040
I'm sick.

21:40.040 --> 21:41.040
Jamie's going crazy.

21:41.040 --> 21:42.040
Fuck you.

21:42.040 --> 21:46.040
Jamie's taking a little too many meds.

21:46.040 --> 21:49.040
Bummer ferret. You see this? It's mine now.

21:49.040 --> 21:50.040
Give me a ferret.

21:50.040 --> 21:51.040
It's mine.

21:51.040 --> 21:52.040
Give me a ferret.

21:52.040 --> 21:53.040
You have a ferret.

21:53.040 --> 22:07.440
We all sat in our seats and everything, and we had to go find Julie and Krista and Becky

22:07.440 --> 22:09.540
and all of them who weren't going to meet us there.

22:09.540 --> 22:11.540
People you don't know, listeners of Orange On The Radio.

22:11.540 --> 22:14.180
Julie's been in the chat room before.

22:14.180 --> 22:15.180
Oh, that's true.

22:15.180 --> 22:16.180
That's right.

22:16.180 --> 22:17.180
That's right.

22:17.180 --> 22:18.180
She has.

22:18.180 --> 22:19.180
My bad.

22:19.180 --> 22:23.840
Weird Al was awesome and fabulous and there were these stupid fuckers around us smoking

22:23.840 --> 22:26.060
them getting to that later.

22:26.060 --> 22:27.060
I hope they die.

22:27.060 --> 22:28.060
Smoking crack or what?

22:28.060 --> 22:29.900
And then there were these sluts in the row in front of us.

22:29.900 --> 22:30.900
I swear.

22:30.900 --> 22:32.300
They were trying to out hoochie each other.

22:32.300 --> 22:33.300
Wait.

22:33.300 --> 22:34.300
Sluts don't listen to Weird Al.

22:34.300 --> 22:35.300
No.

22:35.300 --> 22:36.300
No.

22:36.300 --> 22:37.300
They were in the front row and they were being sluts.

22:37.300 --> 22:39.300
They were trying to out slut each other.

22:39.300 --> 22:46.180
Trying to be super skank and everything and he was making fun of them the whole show.

22:46.180 --> 22:49.060
It was great.

22:49.060 --> 22:54.820
And because he went to see one of the sluts that was in front of us to make fun of her

22:54.820 --> 23:03.440
during the, what is this song called, the one where he's going through all of the pick

23:03.440 --> 23:04.440
up lines?

23:04.440 --> 23:05.440
I don't know.

23:05.440 --> 23:09.140
I don't listen to enough Weird Al, I like Weird Al, but I don't follow him enough.

23:09.140 --> 23:12.420
He was like right in front of us, so I got a good look at him and everything, and I took

23:12.420 --> 23:15.820
a picture of the back of his head during One More Minute.

23:15.820 --> 23:17.500
So wait, you guys were in the second row?

23:17.500 --> 23:21.820
Well, there was like the priority seating in front of us that was about six

23:21.820 --> 23:25.680
rows that were all blocked off and then, but he came into our area too

23:25.680 --> 23:27.680
to make fun of the sluts, I guess.

23:27.680 --> 23:31.960
He went way back in the whole paid seating area, it was great. That's cool.

23:31.960 --> 23:35.240
Pay for your tickets when you go to the fair, you'll get good seats.

23:35.240 --> 23:37.480
Loki, they went to Fresno

23:37.480 --> 23:39.760
at the Madera County Fair.

23:39.760 --> 23:42.320
But today was Great America, I'm surprised you didn't go.

23:42.320 --> 23:46.480
Because it's forty bucks. Not you, Loki.

23:46.480 --> 23:50.400
I was going to go, but that was supposed to be for my birthday.

23:50.400 --> 23:56.720
But yeah, no one took me.

23:56.720 --> 23:58.520
I didn't know he wanted to go.

23:58.520 --> 23:59.520
I would have taken him.

23:59.520 --> 24:01.720
I had this plan for a month and a half.

24:01.720 --> 24:04.760
I know.

24:04.760 --> 24:06.400
You guys all piled in a van, right?

24:06.400 --> 24:12.280
Yeah, Vandalous took us in his van, his SUV.

24:12.280 --> 24:19.680
It was a comfy SUV, too, and I sort of slept on the way back, but it was a really fun time,

24:19.680 --> 24:24.960
and it was funny watching the skanks shred out, skank each other, but this one girl decided

24:24.960 --> 24:29.560
that she had to dance every time, so we're like, sit your stupid skinny butt down, you're

24:29.560 --> 24:30.560
ugly.

24:30.560 --> 24:32.920
Did she say she was ugly?

24:32.920 --> 24:39.280
No, we just were like, hey, down in front, and she's like, oh, oh, I'm sorry, I'm stupid,

24:39.280 --> 24:41.720
and sat down.

24:41.720 --> 24:46.840
He changed the Yoda chant, well not really changed it, but more like expanded it.

24:46.840 --> 24:47.840
It was pretty cool.

24:47.840 --> 24:49.520
And for those that don't know what the Yoda chant is?

24:49.520 --> 24:52.400
I don't remember how to do the whole Yoda chant.

24:52.400 --> 24:58.080
If you've been to a weird house show, you know the Yoda chant.

24:58.080 --> 25:04.120
He did that stupid, he did the stinky song that was making fun of that stupid personnelly

25:04.120 --> 25:08.840
like I hate.

25:08.840 --> 25:12.680
Let's get in hot in here, so take off all your clothes."

25:12.680 --> 25:13.680
Yeah, I know that one.

25:13.680 --> 25:19.200
They put a bunch of trash cans on the stage, it was great, and they did all about the Pentiums,

25:19.200 --> 25:21.200
and did, of course, one more minute.

25:21.200 --> 25:23.360
Is it just me or is Weird Al getting old?

25:23.360 --> 25:24.360
Shut up.

25:24.360 --> 25:27.280
He's got a baby.

25:27.280 --> 25:28.280
I know.

25:28.280 --> 25:29.280
Well, he didn't have the baby.

25:29.280 --> 25:30.920
Well, his wife has a baby.

25:30.920 --> 25:35.800
But still, I saw him in an interview recently, and I'm like, Weird Al's getting old?

25:35.800 --> 25:36.800
It was weird.

25:36.800 --> 25:37.800
You're getting old too.

25:37.800 --> 25:38.800
I know.

25:38.800 --> 25:42.480
We're all getting old, but he's getting, like, really old.

25:42.480 --> 25:44.640
I still kind of look like my yearbook picture.

25:44.640 --> 25:47.240
He doesn't look very old at all.

25:47.240 --> 25:51.880
He did some of his parody interviews.

25:51.880 --> 25:53.400
I'm moving out in the living room so people can see me.

25:53.400 --> 25:54.400
I want to be on the panel.

25:54.400 --> 26:01.240
He did one with Justin Timberlake and Britney on the TV.

26:01.240 --> 26:02.240
It was great.

26:02.240 --> 26:03.880
Justin Timberlake is the best sock.

26:03.880 --> 26:05.880
The best one was the Celine Dion one.

26:05.880 --> 26:06.880
Oh, shit.

26:06.880 --> 26:11.600
Well, I know when you were a child, you had this traumatic experience where you're going

26:11.600 --> 26:13.920
skiing and your whole family was eaten by cannibals.

26:13.920 --> 26:17.240
He's like, yes, I remember the smell of my mother cooking.

26:17.240 --> 26:19.960
He's like, I bet it was horrible for you.

26:19.960 --> 26:21.960
No, it was fun.

26:21.960 --> 26:27.280
The Avril Lavigne one, he's like, say something incoherently for us.

26:27.280 --> 26:31.480
Well, I don't think, you know, she's going off on something, it was really great.

26:31.480 --> 26:34.720
And the interviews were great.

26:34.720 --> 26:37.720
This is actually, I think, the one tonight is his last show of the tour.

26:37.720 --> 26:38.720
Oh, yeah.

26:38.720 --> 26:42.600
So all you people missed out.

26:42.600 --> 26:44.240
Here's Jamie's chance to rub it in.

26:44.240 --> 26:49.640
With a ferret.

26:49.640 --> 26:53.900
So weird owl, skanks, good songs, good time.

26:53.900 --> 26:56.200
I have pictures, and I took pictures of the fireworks.

26:56.200 --> 26:59.480
Tell me about where you guys went to eat, because this is a funny story.

26:59.480 --> 27:00.480
I hop.

27:00.480 --> 27:02.160
I told you about I hop.

27:02.160 --> 27:03.160
You told me about it?

27:03.160 --> 27:04.160
Did you tell them?

27:04.160 --> 27:13.280
I hope it was the happiest place on earth, because it looked like Happy up and threw

27:13.280 --> 27:14.680
up all over it.

27:14.680 --> 27:19.760
It's like Happy decided to pop and go, oh, I'm happy, happy, puke, and the whole place

27:19.760 --> 27:21.040
was covered in happy faces.

27:21.040 --> 27:23.040
So it looked like a Walmart.

27:23.040 --> 27:24.040
Yeah.

27:24.040 --> 27:25.040
Walmart is not a happy place.

27:25.040 --> 27:31.320
It made Walmart look like the sewer.

27:31.320 --> 27:32.880
rat-infested

27:32.880 --> 27:39.320
Sewer that it is, but anyway, I'll talk about that later much later, and I have issues with Walmart this week

27:40.440 --> 27:43.640
But it was it was too happy and then today. I

27:44.220 --> 27:47.360
We got home at like 3 30 long enough for me to do a little

27:48.160 --> 27:53.520
Post-lit in my life journal, and then I passed out and was dead for a while, and then I got up early

27:53.520 --> 27:59.800
I have to interject a pixie dust comment from the chat room.

27:59.800 --> 28:05.640
It says, well, rub it in all you want, but IHOP has the rooty-tooty fresh and free.

28:05.640 --> 28:09.180
I had pumpkin pancakes, and that's much better.

28:09.180 --> 28:10.880
You know what the best pancake is, though?

28:10.880 --> 28:11.880
Pumpkin.

28:11.880 --> 28:13.880
No, the one that looks like the smiley face.

28:13.880 --> 28:14.880
No, pumpkin.

28:14.880 --> 28:15.880
The smiley face.

28:15.880 --> 28:16.880
Pumpkin.

28:16.880 --> 28:17.880
It had pumpkin syrup.

28:17.880 --> 28:19.740
Oh, it's so good.

28:19.740 --> 28:20.740
So today?

28:20.740 --> 28:21.740
Oh, pumpkin.

28:21.740 --> 28:27.920
Today, I felt like shit, and I felt like shit when I went home, because I'm still sick and

28:27.920 --> 28:33.360
I shouldn't have gone, and I had to go around the livestock, but I got to shoot a man yesterday.

28:33.360 --> 28:36.760
Oh yeah, you shot a guy like 33 times?

28:36.760 --> 28:39.520
They had a paintball thing, and I was shooting little targets.

28:39.520 --> 28:46.640
I shot a bunny in the head, and I shot a teddy bear in the ass, and I was shooting all the

28:46.640 --> 28:51.280
small targets, and then I decided to use my last 20 or so shots on the

28:51.280 --> 28:53.920
man himself who was just standing there all padded up.

28:53.920 --> 28:54.920
I got him in the head.

28:54.920 --> 28:55.920
And it was the real guy.

28:55.920 --> 28:58.800
Real guy, all bundled up in paintball gear.

28:58.800 --> 29:00.880
I shot him in the head.

29:00.880 --> 29:02.320
I shot him in his heart.

29:02.320 --> 29:03.900
I shot him in his groin.

29:03.900 --> 29:08.800
I shot him in the right kneecap enough to make him back up a step.

29:08.800 --> 29:11.080
And I shot him a bunch of other places, and I think I shot him in the

29:11.080 --> 29:15.400
eyeball once, but he was wearing goggles, so it wasn't much fun.

29:15.400 --> 29:18.400
I was like, oh, no more?

29:18.400 --> 29:21.400
Was there a little heckler there, too, that was telling you to shut up?

29:21.400 --> 29:22.400
Who is this?

29:22.400 --> 29:23.400
Some stupid little kid.

29:23.400 --> 29:24.400
You can curse on OrangeHawn's radio.

29:24.400 --> 29:25.400
It's OK.

29:25.400 --> 29:26.400
I don't feel like cursing.

29:26.400 --> 29:28.400
I feel like being clean today because I'm sick.

29:28.400 --> 29:31.400
You know I'm sick when I'm talking like a good little girl.

29:31.400 --> 29:32.400
Fuck him.

29:32.400 --> 29:33.400
Stupid little kid.

29:33.400 --> 29:34.400
OK.

29:34.400 --> 29:35.400
Stupid little kid.

29:35.400 --> 29:36.400
OK.

29:36.400 --> 29:37.400
Hit it.

29:37.400 --> 29:38.400
Hit the guy.

29:38.400 --> 29:39.400
Hit the guy.

29:39.400 --> 29:40.400
Don't hit the little thing.

29:40.400 --> 29:41.400
Hit the guy.

29:41.400 --> 29:42.400
Hit the man.

29:42.400 --> 29:43.400
I'm like, OK.

29:43.400 --> 29:44.400
This is where Vandalous is going.

29:44.400 --> 29:48.040
I told the kid, okay, don't talk when I'm shooting or I'll shoot you.

29:48.040 --> 29:49.040
I didn't say that.

29:49.040 --> 29:52.280
I was like, don't talk, do me a favor kid, don't talk when I'm shooting.

29:52.280 --> 29:53.280
But it's fun.

29:53.280 --> 29:54.800
I was like, no, it's not.

29:54.800 --> 29:57.720
I would have turned that gun right around and opened fire.

29:57.720 --> 30:00.680
Oh, the thing was so touchy.

30:00.680 --> 30:04.440
I could have had that thing go, blub, blub, blub, blub, blub, blub, die.

30:04.440 --> 30:06.120
It was a very touchy gun.

30:06.120 --> 30:08.420
But we all shot people, it was good.

30:08.420 --> 30:12.080
I've done that with the water gun, but they only turned so far, you can't really shoot

30:12.080 --> 30:13.600
your neighbor, but you can get a stream point.

30:13.600 --> 30:20.600
I could have pulled this thing completely out and gone on a murderous paintball rampage.

30:20.600 --> 30:22.600
Why would you?

30:22.600 --> 30:24.600
Because there weren't enough children around.

30:24.600 --> 30:29.600
Just that one kid and he wasn't worth me wasting the ammo I paid for.

30:29.600 --> 30:33.600
It was a good time and today I felt really crappy.

30:33.600 --> 30:41.600
I took a picture of a cow that was acting like a cat hunched down like Shermie does,

30:41.600 --> 30:47.960
the camera licking his shoulder. I'm cute. I think I'm a cat, but I'm really a cow, boo.

30:47.960 --> 30:56.960
We came up with some retarded animal sounds. Moo. Moo. I think that was... Okay. We were

30:56.960 --> 31:03.120
in the IHOP going, yay, and then talking about animals. Somebody was saying earlier in the

31:03.120 --> 31:08.340
chat room that Weird Al should be in Bamani. No. No, I don't think so either. I don't want

31:08.340 --> 31:13.220
Bimani to ruin Weird Al, but Weird Al should do a parody of a Bimani song.

31:13.220 --> 31:14.220
No.

31:14.220 --> 31:16.220
I think he should.

31:16.220 --> 31:18.700
He'd make like, Love Me Do the Polka.

31:18.700 --> 31:22.340
That would be great, a Bimani polka, come on.

31:22.340 --> 31:23.620
Tell me that would not be beautiful.

31:23.620 --> 31:28.940
I don't think he'd do it.

31:28.940 --> 31:31.540
I-I-I-I am your little butterfly.

31:31.540 --> 31:32.540
No.

31:32.540 --> 31:33.540
No.

31:33.540 --> 31:35.540
No smell-decay polka, thank you.

31:35.540 --> 31:41.540
But anyway, I was sick all day, but we went out for lunch with somebody in this room.

31:41.540 --> 31:42.540
Hi.

31:42.540 --> 31:43.540
Hi.

31:43.540 --> 31:50.660
And it was lots of fun, and then I picked up my Transformers comics today like I do

31:50.660 --> 31:51.660
every Sunday.

31:51.660 --> 31:52.660
Uh-huh.

31:52.660 --> 32:01.380
And came back home, and Melody took a nap with Shermie.

32:01.380 --> 32:02.380
Aww.

32:02.380 --> 32:07.460
And I bummed her out online and then she went home but she's coming back because her laptop's

32:07.460 --> 32:08.860
at my house.

32:08.860 --> 32:13.940
So we'll have a special surprise visit from Shark's Girl in a little while.

32:13.940 --> 32:14.940
Surprise!

32:14.940 --> 32:15.940
Surprise!

32:15.940 --> 32:22.420
So I might have to leave a bit early but I'm doing other things here too.

32:22.420 --> 32:25.780
Yeah, my clothes are visiting too.

32:25.780 --> 32:27.300
Yes, lankystyle has it.

32:27.300 --> 32:29.540
He says superstar polka style.

32:29.540 --> 32:30.540
No!

32:30.540 --> 32:31.540
No!

32:31.540 --> 32:36.540
I'm here today.

32:36.540 --> 32:39.540
That earned you a fap in the head by the ferret.

32:39.540 --> 32:41.540
Did you say a fap in the head?

32:41.540 --> 32:42.540
I said a fap.

32:42.540 --> 32:44.540
I thought she said a fap.

32:44.540 --> 32:48.540
Okay, it earned you a fap in the head by the ferret.

32:48.540 --> 32:50.540
The ferret will hump your head.

32:50.540 --> 32:53.540
The ferret will fap you in the head.

32:53.540 --> 32:54.540
Anyway.

32:54.540 --> 32:59.540
But I still, I'm, you know, not feeling very well right now.

32:59.540 --> 33:04.900
Don't expect much out of me, but whining and angst.

33:04.900 --> 33:07.020
You can't whine with your angst today.

33:07.020 --> 33:08.860
What do we expect from you usually?

33:08.860 --> 33:09.860
Shut up.

33:09.860 --> 33:16.540
You need to be funny and excited and bouncy and you know what, on top of that, my purse

33:16.540 --> 33:19.540
is dead, which puts me off, so I'm going to use my bunny backpack.

33:19.540 --> 33:25.020
My bunny backpack broke, so now I have it rigged because it's the only thing I have.

33:25.020 --> 33:26.020
I have to go buy a new purse.

33:26.020 --> 33:27.020
I don't have any money.

33:27.020 --> 33:32.180
And I have to put on the credit card, probably, because I need a purse, and Matt's humping

33:32.180 --> 33:35.180
the chair.

33:35.180 --> 33:36.180
He's fapping the chair.

33:36.180 --> 33:37.180
You're fapping the chair.

33:37.180 --> 33:42.180
You were faced the other way.

33:42.180 --> 33:47.980
Oh, John Field suggests a bye-bye baby balloon polka.

33:47.980 --> 33:49.380
A polka polka!

33:49.380 --> 33:50.380
Yes!

33:50.380 --> 33:51.380
No!

33:51.380 --> 33:58.380
I don't have energy.

33:58.380 --> 34:00.220
Stand up!

34:00.220 --> 34:01.740
Stand up!

34:01.740 --> 34:03.020
Stand up!

34:03.020 --> 34:04.180
Stand up!

34:04.180 --> 34:05.180
Why?

34:05.180 --> 34:06.180
Stand up!

34:06.180 --> 34:08.980
I don't want to stand up.

34:08.980 --> 34:09.980
No!

34:09.980 --> 34:10.980
Stand up!

34:10.980 --> 34:12.980
I'm standing up.

34:12.980 --> 34:14.180
Ow!

34:14.180 --> 34:17.180
No polka!

34:17.180 --> 34:20.900
I only want polka!

34:20.900 --> 34:25.460
I want a Joga Polka, come on. I want Trance Polka.

34:25.460 --> 34:32.020
The Beauty of Silence Polka. The Beauty of Polka!

34:32.020 --> 34:35.540
That's a remix you should do.

34:35.540 --> 34:40.100
I'm sorry, I don't make crap.

34:40.100 --> 34:45.860
Is T-Dog listening? Maybe he could make a Beauty of Polka.

34:45.860 --> 34:49.740
Don't put it past him. That's my new name, T-Dog.

34:49.740 --> 34:51.740
You know who?

34:51.740 --> 34:53.740
Newt!

34:53.740 --> 34:55.740
Well said, huh?

34:55.740 --> 34:57.740
Anyway...

34:57.740 --> 34:59.740
Hi Newt!

34:59.740 --> 35:01.740
Is that all you have to say about your day and your week?

35:01.740 --> 35:03.740
I think I have a fever again

35:03.740 --> 35:05.740
and I have to go to work tomorrow

35:05.740 --> 35:07.740
You don't have to

35:07.740 --> 35:09.740
Unless you want to get fired

35:09.740 --> 35:11.740
I have a doctor's excuse though

35:11.740 --> 35:13.740
so nah

35:13.740 --> 35:15.740
And I'm on lots of drugs

35:15.740 --> 35:17.740
I have to snort liquid cocaine

35:17.740 --> 35:25.340
cocaine. Cool. I don't know. It's called Nasrel. It's like burned. It's like inhaling snot

35:25.340 --> 35:31.620
but on fire. It's really disgusting. Ferb is criticizing my pronunciation of Domdaryam.

35:31.620 --> 35:42.300
It's Domdaryam. Domdaryam. Domdaryam. How about Domdaryam? No. Daryam. I like Daryam

35:42.300 --> 35:49.180
because it sounds like derriere. It's a stupid JOGA song. Stupid JOGA song. From now on...

35:49.180 --> 35:53.560
You know what? I don't care if my pronunciation of Dom Doyon was a little odd and wrong because

35:53.560 --> 36:01.560
the British say everything odd. So, you know what? Shut up! That's mean. I'm just kidding.

36:01.560 --> 36:12.260
So in Kick Rob... You're closer. Kick Rob for me. No. Okay. Anyway, let's go on to Loki

36:12.260 --> 36:14.860
if you're done talking about your week I'm gonna tickle my laundry

36:14.860 --> 36:19.460
K I think your wash is done because I don't hear it spinning anymore. In the meantime we'll talk to Loki

36:19.460 --> 36:22.700
I have a long board. I have a long board. It was alright

36:22.700 --> 36:27.340
I didn't do anything. Sat there. Rotting away at work

36:27.340 --> 36:31.500
I want spinners tonight

36:31.500 --> 36:34.860
those are going to be for my BeatMania controller. And what is a spinner?

36:34.860 --> 36:39.060
It's exactly that. It spins. It's a little controller. Like a top?

36:39.060 --> 36:41.060
Like a knob.

36:43.060 --> 36:44.060
Spins like a knob.

36:44.060 --> 36:45.060
You bought a knob.

36:46.060 --> 36:47.060
Two knobs.

36:48.060 --> 36:56.060
Anyways, so, um, I bought those and then, um, pretty much worked on my pads a little bit.

36:56.060 --> 36:58.060
Have all the metal bent on them now.

36:58.060 --> 37:03.060
And, um, made a remix, did some show.

37:03.060 --> 37:05.060
Yes, we have a new Loki remix coming soon.

37:06.060 --> 37:07.060
Tonight. At some point. Yes?

37:07.060 --> 37:10.760
at some point yes i already finished it i said during the show

37:10.760 --> 37:12.600
maybe next break then

37:12.600 --> 37:17.060
maybe maybe alright i dedicated it to the uh...

37:17.060 --> 37:20.580
that around railroad train the crash

37:20.580 --> 37:21.940
okay

37:21.940 --> 37:23.460
so we have the uh...

37:23.460 --> 37:26.780
whatever song it's going to be big thunder mountain mixer witnesses

37:26.780 --> 37:29.700
well i like that one better i want to change it

37:29.700 --> 37:33.500
but it was just going to be called the rail mix but uh... the big but i like

37:33.500 --> 37:35.500
I like the big Thunder Mountain mix.

37:35.500 --> 37:37.500
How many of your remixes have I named?

37:37.500 --> 37:40.500
This is at least the second or third one.

37:40.500 --> 37:43.500
I named another one. There was another one I named.

37:43.500 --> 37:47.500
It was Matrix 1, Gravity Reloaded.

37:47.500 --> 37:49.500
Yeah, uh-huh.

37:49.500 --> 37:51.500
I rule. You just don't want to admit it.

37:51.500 --> 37:52.500
Whatever.

37:52.500 --> 37:54.500
Since I have money, I have to go buy the...

37:54.500 --> 37:57.500
I was shopping for a computer today for my main cabinet,

37:57.500 --> 37:59.500
and that was expensive, so I didn't buy it.

37:59.500 --> 38:03.300
and I was going to shop for parts online for the main cabinet.

38:03.300 --> 38:05.420
That was also expensive, so I didn't buy it.

38:05.420 --> 38:08.500
And so pretty much, it's just pricing stuff right now

38:08.500 --> 38:11.500
and working on it and that kind of thing.

38:11.500 --> 38:13.100
But anyways.

38:13.100 --> 38:15.700
Mikey style says a spinner is a short, thin girl.

38:22.420 --> 38:24.260
Loki buying that online?

38:24.260 --> 38:25.420
Never.

38:25.420 --> 38:27.500
And two of them.

38:27.500 --> 38:34.500
I resent that, because one day I'm going to invent the one that women can have, and

38:57.500 --> 38:59.420
that

38:59.420 --> 39:01.700
my friend there to have cocks for women

39:01.700 --> 39:03.060
the bajai cock

39:03.060 --> 39:03.880
no

39:03.880 --> 39:06.740
i have that will she's not really a friend i guess anymore but this girl

39:06.740 --> 39:10.100
that i know who's really responsible and is kind of stupid

39:10.100 --> 39:11.820
she said she wanted a dick

39:11.820 --> 39:14.580
so that she could whip it out and piss on people

39:14.580 --> 39:18.260
all right we know what happens when people wish for dicks okay we've already watched that

39:18.260 --> 39:20.220
movie i haven't

39:20.220 --> 39:21.260
having a dick

39:21.260 --> 39:24.220
it isn't all that because when you get a dick

39:24.220 --> 39:28.320
When you get a dick, you get balls as well, and people can kick you there, and imagine

39:28.320 --> 39:29.680
like your entire three day...

39:29.680 --> 39:31.820
I've often said it's much better to be a woman.

39:31.820 --> 39:37.560
Imagine your whole three days worth of cramps piled into five seconds of intense pain.

39:37.560 --> 39:39.140
That's what being kicked in the balls feels like.

39:39.140 --> 39:42.880
Yeah, but the five seconds goes away.

39:42.880 --> 39:46.140
You have no idea what cramps feel like.

39:46.140 --> 39:49.420
Imagine having pain that makes you puke.

39:49.420 --> 39:52.060
Somebody once told me what having a baby felt like.

39:52.060 --> 39:55.180
it's like pulling your lower lip over your head.

39:55.180 --> 39:57.140
That's what somebody told me it was.

39:57.140 --> 39:58.140
Family guy.

39:58.140 --> 40:00.300
It's off a family guy, you freaking loser.

40:00.300 --> 40:05.780
There was a movie that described it as trying to push something the size of a watermelon

40:05.780 --> 40:09.580
out of something, a hole the size of a pea.

40:09.580 --> 40:10.580
I think it was a lemon.

40:10.580 --> 40:11.580
A lemon, yeah.

40:11.580 --> 40:14.540
And that was Chasing Amy.

40:14.540 --> 40:16.620
Giving birth sucks and I'm never going to do it.

40:16.620 --> 40:19.700
That's why they cut open your stomach and pulled a damn kid out.

40:19.700 --> 40:21.380
It's just like, what the hell's the point?

40:21.380 --> 40:25.200
It's like trying to shove a piano through a door when there's a perfectly good window

40:25.200 --> 40:27.200
right there.

40:27.200 --> 40:34.700
I mean, I don't see the point.

40:34.700 --> 40:36.920
And that's why men will never have babies.

40:36.920 --> 40:39.760
The genius of Loki on Orange Lounge Radio.

40:39.760 --> 40:43.180
You know what?

40:43.180 --> 40:46.360
It's bad enough that the world has to deal with me.

40:46.360 --> 40:50.040
I'm not putting any more children on this earth, but congratulations to those who have,

40:50.040 --> 40:56.600
Oh yeah, I found out this week that my sister's probably going to need brain surgery.

40:56.600 --> 40:57.600
Really?

40:57.600 --> 41:00.960
Yeah, because she has something wrong with her pituitary gland or something like that

41:00.960 --> 41:06.920
that's causing her cells, and I quote, went crazy.

41:06.920 --> 41:11.660
And so they're like, that affects how much your blood's produced and other crap like

41:11.660 --> 41:12.660
that.

41:12.660 --> 41:15.480
So they have to operate or possibly treat medication.

41:15.480 --> 41:16.480
Ouch.

41:16.480 --> 41:19.880
Sure it is.

41:19.880 --> 41:20.860
How was that funny?

41:20.860 --> 41:23.000
I don't know.

41:23.000 --> 41:26.260
It's not life threatening, so it's not bad.

41:26.260 --> 41:30.120
I would imagine having someone operate on your brain itself

41:30.120 --> 41:32.400
is life threatening.

41:32.400 --> 41:34.840
Would you like, oh, hi, we're going to open your head

41:34.840 --> 41:36.040
and poke with your brain.

41:36.040 --> 41:38.520
It doesn't hurt, it kind of tickles.

41:38.520 --> 41:40.920
And you've had brain surgery, that would explain it.

41:40.920 --> 41:42.840
That would explain a few things.

41:42.840 --> 41:48.160
No, yeah, so not much going on other than my birthday

41:48.160 --> 41:49.600
this week, but you know.

41:49.600 --> 41:51.000
Happy birthday.

41:51.000 --> 41:52.800
Yeah, it hasn't occurred yet.

41:52.800 --> 41:54.520
9-11 is when my birthday is.

41:54.520 --> 41:57.120
But I'm thinking in advance, because I'm not going to.

41:57.120 --> 41:58.200
Well, I might be over here.

41:58.200 --> 42:00.840
Anyways, but yeah, so I went ahead

42:00.840 --> 42:06.040
and we kind of had a little party for me on Saturday

42:06.040 --> 42:07.800
for just kind of because my mom's

42:07.800 --> 42:10.440
going to be out of town for both my birthday and my sister's

42:10.440 --> 42:13.200
birthday, so kind of lumped us all together

42:13.200 --> 42:14.840
and did all that kind of thing.

42:14.840 --> 42:16.600
Happy collective birthday.

42:16.600 --> 42:17.520
Yes.

42:17.520 --> 42:19.160
And so that was kind of cool.

42:19.160 --> 42:21.480
And then, I don't know what's going on this week.

42:21.480 --> 42:24.720
Supposed to go out to dinner with my girlfriend on Thursday.

42:24.720 --> 42:26.760
And yeah, that's about it.

42:30.040 --> 42:31.520
My turn.

42:31.520 --> 42:34.440
My week was kind of shitty because I was, like Jamie,

42:34.440 --> 42:35.080
I was sick.

42:35.080 --> 42:38.000
I didn't have quite the multiple layers of infection

42:38.000 --> 42:39.640
that she had in the end.

42:39.640 --> 42:41.360
Oh yeah, I had a sinus infection too.

42:41.360 --> 42:43.320
And they tested me for strep throat, but I don't have it.

42:43.320 --> 42:44.640
I was just feeling like shit.

42:44.640 --> 42:45.880
And it wasn't to the point where I'm like,

42:45.880 --> 42:47.360
ah, I got to go to a doctor.

42:47.360 --> 42:50.220
Because I just went to the doctor a couple of weeks ago for something else, and after

42:50.220 --> 42:56.200
that whole experience I didn't want to go back for a while, so I just kind of slept

42:56.200 --> 42:57.200
it off.

42:57.200 --> 43:02.560
Literally, I went to work, I would come home, nap, wake up for an hour, and go to bed.

43:02.560 --> 43:04.240
That was my week, pretty much.

43:04.240 --> 43:05.240
It sucked.

43:05.240 --> 43:07.640
And then I had this huge thing on my arm.

43:07.640 --> 43:14.960
I don't know if it's a zit or what, but I saw one of my exes on Thursday who I hadn't

43:14.960 --> 43:20.560
in quite a while. And of course, he's got one of those sarcastic kinds of humor. And

43:20.560 --> 43:24.880
no, it is not AIDS. He said, it looks like I do drugs.

43:24.880 --> 43:28.320
It's who it is. So now I'm kind of like, oh, cool, I can go

43:28.320 --> 43:31.200
around and show people at work. Like people at work probably think I do drugs. That's

43:31.200 --> 43:35.480
pretty cool. But then I show my mother and she's like,

43:35.480 --> 43:39.480
you've got a bone. It's an infected blood vessel and you're going to die if you don't

43:39.480 --> 43:44.480
go to the doctor and get it taken care of. Have you tried Lansing yet?

43:44.480 --> 43:48.800
Well, I can't, but it's going down, so why make a big deal out of it if it's going down?

43:48.800 --> 43:49.800
That's why I told her.

43:49.800 --> 43:50.800
Well, make sure that you take Benadryl.

43:50.800 --> 43:51.800
Benadryl.

43:51.800 --> 43:52.800
Take him before bed, people.

43:52.800 --> 43:53.800
Knock your ass out.

43:53.800 --> 43:58.000
That's what I've been living on is Benadryl at night.

43:58.000 --> 43:59.560
That's my anti-drug.

43:59.560 --> 44:03.280
My mother also told me something very scary yesterday that made me kind of want to hit

44:03.280 --> 44:04.280
her.

44:04.280 --> 44:05.280
What?

44:05.280 --> 44:10.440
She said, I'm so in love with Cher that I think I'm a lesbian, and then she laughed.

44:10.440 --> 44:15.440
And I was like, don't you EVER say that again!

44:15.440 --> 44:16.440
This is alarming!

44:16.440 --> 44:18.440
That is very alarming!

44:18.440 --> 44:28.280
You know, I wouldn't say it's too much lesbianism there, because she is quite mannish.

44:28.280 --> 44:29.280
Cher that is.

44:29.280 --> 44:31.160
She sounds like a, she sings like a horse.

44:31.160 --> 44:32.800
That was pretty much my response.

44:32.800 --> 44:37.800
She doesn't look like a horse.

44:37.800 --> 44:41.680
For those who wonder, Cher was actually doing a concert in Sacramento last night.

44:41.680 --> 44:43.460
It was her farewell tour.

44:43.460 --> 44:48.080
Second time she's been here, by the way, on the farewell tour.

44:48.080 --> 44:51.600
We went the first time, so we didn't see the need to go the second time.

44:51.600 --> 44:54.520
I know why she's doing a farewell tour, because she's running out of things to do plastic

44:54.520 --> 44:55.520
surgery on.

44:55.520 --> 44:56.520
Seriously.

44:56.520 --> 45:01.980
But the second time, Cyndi Lauper wasn't opening, so it wasn't worth going to, because the first

45:01.980 --> 45:04.740
time Cyndi Lauper was opening, so I was like, okay, cool.

45:04.740 --> 45:07.660
But this time, some other Shmo was opening, so forget it.

45:07.660 --> 45:33.700
So I decided to go out last night because I'm feeling better.

45:33.700 --> 45:34.700
So I went out with my buddy Matt.

45:34.700 --> 45:39.500
I was supposed to go to some barbeque with Irene and Brad, but they never called me.

45:39.500 --> 45:41.540
I went out with Matt instead.

45:41.540 --> 45:46.940
We went to the Streets of London, which is a little pub downtown.

45:46.940 --> 45:50.980
We went to this place and I ate this huge plate of...

45:50.980 --> 45:55.140
The Streets of London has the best fish and chips.

45:55.140 --> 45:56.780
Well, I didn't have that.

45:56.780 --> 46:00.020
I had a big plate of fries covered in cheese and bacon.

46:00.020 --> 46:01.380
Mmm, fat, yes.

46:01.380 --> 46:02.380
Chips.

46:02.380 --> 46:03.380
Sorry.

46:03.380 --> 46:04.380
Chips, cheese, and bacon.

46:04.380 --> 46:23.580
dad. Stupid British slang. So we went there, and I actually drank beer, but it was Guinness,

46:23.580 --> 46:24.580
so I'm forgiven.

46:24.580 --> 46:29.180
Guinness is beautiful. Guinness is the drink of the gods.

46:29.180 --> 46:32.300
After that, we went over to the Depot because it was kind of late. We didn't really want

46:32.300 --> 46:36.340
to go dancing, dancing. So we went over to the Depot, which is a gay bar in Sacramento.

46:36.340 --> 46:39.940
Me and my friend Matt, the Ice Princess, been on this show before. We went over there and

46:39.940 --> 46:44.880
then we met a whole bunch of other people there. We met two people he knew from online

46:44.880 --> 46:51.180
and we met Phoenix, also Corey. You may or may not have met him. I don't know if you

46:51.180 --> 46:56.720
have before or not. And then our other friend Joshy, who's leaving town, we just had a good

46:56.720 --> 47:01.520
old time. We were partying it up. But this is the funny thing. It was the Cher concert

47:01.520 --> 47:07.680
after party. So they started playing just like nonstop Cher stuff and we're like, okay,

47:07.680 --> 47:11.000
we have to go. And we went to this new burger joint they opened up next door. It's a brand

47:11.000 --> 47:15.600
new burger joint. It's a gay burger joint in the gay district of Sacramento. It's called

47:15.600 --> 47:23.640
hot rods. I didn't get to play pinball at the depot last night, though. That made me

47:23.640 --> 47:26.240
sad. There was actually people on them all night, but they have pinball at the depot.

47:26.240 --> 47:29.160
Was there good food, though, at the hot rods?

47:29.160 --> 47:36.280
Hot rods, actually, the fries are damn good. It's a lot like In-N-Out, the place, but they

47:36.280 --> 47:39.800
have more. They have garden burgers if you want them. They have turkey burgers if you

47:39.800 --> 47:45.680
you want them. They have the hot dogs if you're into that, chicken strips, whatever. They

47:45.680 --> 47:48.680
have way bigger menu. Some people like hot dogs.

47:48.680 --> 48:04.680
Some people like Polish dogs. Okay. I'm not Chinese, so I don't eat dog. What'd you say,

48:04.680 --> 48:10.680
Yeah, well, I'm not... Wait, no, I don't know if it's Chinese that eats... I can't remember.

48:10.680 --> 48:13.680
Hello?

48:13.680 --> 48:15.680
Eee, I can't reach the ferret.

48:15.680 --> 48:17.680
Come in!

48:17.680 --> 48:18.680
Hello!

48:18.680 --> 48:19.680
Hi!

48:19.680 --> 48:24.680
Sharks Girl's here! Not by choice.

48:24.680 --> 48:25.680
Speak to our people.

48:25.680 --> 48:28.680
Well, Sharks Girl, why don't you tell... We're all sitting around doing, how was your week, how was your day?

48:28.680 --> 48:31.680
Why don't you tell us, how was your week and how was your day?

48:31.680 --> 48:37.920
Week sucked. Yesterday was good. Today was good until about what, 6 p.m.?

48:37.920 --> 48:42.200
Then it has sucked balls from there on out and I want to say for the record

48:42.200 --> 48:44.040
Folsom sucks and has no cell phone reception.

48:44.040 --> 48:48.440
I get cell phone reception at my house. I've dropped like

48:48.440 --> 48:52.080
four times since I got off the 50.

48:52.080 --> 48:56.600
Ouch. Sorry. Okay.

48:56.600 --> 49:00.040
We're going to take a quick break and get back on track. We have a lot of

49:00.040 --> 49:02.300
money news we want to talk about here

49:02.300 --> 49:03.500
yeah there's a trip

49:03.500 --> 49:06.220
the track not in disneyland

49:06.220 --> 49:08.800
uh...

49:08.800 --> 49:10.940
okay rob's going to hell

49:10.940 --> 49:13.940
the

49:13.940 --> 49:17.740
we're going to kick off this break with a brand new loki remix loki would you

49:17.740 --> 49:19.340
like to tell us about your mix

49:19.340 --> 49:20.720
and name on it

49:20.720 --> 49:22.480
always got to change the name on it but

49:22.480 --> 49:23.880
why you change the name tells

49:23.880 --> 49:26.380
tell something about the mix

49:26.380 --> 49:29.040
uh...

49:29.040 --> 49:35.840
cool and stuff. No, I don't know. It was just, um, I needed something to mix together and

49:35.840 --> 49:45.760
this just kind of worked for some reason. So, yeah, it's, um, stoic, the big thunder

49:45.760 --> 49:51.480
mountain mix. All right. This is Loki's brand newest remix. This is stoic, the big thunder

49:51.480 --> 49:58.960
mountain mix. You're on the brand is newest, not just brand is new, the brand is newest.

49:58.960 --> 50:05.960
Here it is, Stoic, the big Thunder Mountain mix, here on Orange Lounge Radio.

51:28.960 --> 51:38.960
music

51:38.960 --> 51:48.960
music

51:48.960 --> 52:18.760
Hey, I like that.

52:18.760 --> 52:22.280
That was pretty cool. That was Stoic, the big Thunder Mountain mix. That was kind of

52:22.280 --> 52:28.400
neat. I have to agree with the chatroom. It kind of sounded a little bit like porn, but

52:28.400 --> 52:34.000
it definitely choo-chooed along there. For once, he didn't use gravity. Let's give him

52:34.000 --> 52:40.960
a hand first, staying away from gravity. Now you've got to do one that's not tack. I don't

52:40.960 --> 52:46.520
know if you can do it. But I like the little bitsaholic there at the end, too. That was

52:46.520 --> 52:51.280
kind of cool. So that was nice. I like that. Good job. Anything, anybody want to say something

52:51.280 --> 52:59.660
about it? Oh, okay. I think we'll go back to break because we got other people doing

52:59.660 --> 53:07.120
other errands or whatever. So we're going to play some more songs and we'll be back

53:07.120 --> 53:14.120
I've got the rhythm in my veins Can't wait to see what you've got

53:37.120 --> 53:40.320
You can find it every day, if you want

53:40.320 --> 53:43.720
And it's so well to take a shit

53:43.720 --> 53:46.920
This game is ready and ready to play

53:46.920 --> 53:50.120
King of the night, he gives me all the time

53:50.120 --> 53:53.520
Walking on the fire, yes I'm burning

53:53.520 --> 53:56.920
Dancing to the lights, the groove is just fine

53:56.920 --> 53:59.920
Don't stop the music, speed up the night

53:59.920 --> 54:03.920
I wanna music, don't stop my imagination

55:03.920 --> 55:05.920
To carry on

55:05.920 --> 55:10.920
Leave me alone if I'm not right

55:10.920 --> 55:12.920
And why?

55:12.920 --> 55:15.920
Leave me alone so many days

55:15.920 --> 55:19.920
Just to give you so many nights

55:19.920 --> 55:24.920
Leave me alone if I'm not right

55:24.920 --> 55:26.920
Tell me why

55:26.920 --> 55:33.920
Now tell me why, now tell me why, now tell me why

57:56.920 --> 58:21.920
Music

58:21.920 --> 58:23.920
Listen to Orange Lounge Radio

58:23.920 --> 58:28.160
Because Bongo demands it.

58:28.160 --> 58:31.000
Hello, and welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio.

58:31.000 --> 58:33.660
And tomorrow, perfume, we heard in that break,

58:33.660 --> 58:35.660
which is kind of part of the Bamani news we've

58:35.660 --> 58:36.900
been hearing about this week.

58:36.900 --> 58:39.480
Is that a remedy to today's stink?

58:39.480 --> 58:43.160
Or as our resident comedian, Lanky Style, says in the chat room,

58:43.160 --> 58:46.680
have you heard the new DJ Taka song sampled for 2DX 10th style?

58:46.680 --> 58:50.320
It's called Yesterday Cologne.

58:50.320 --> 58:53.360
Mm, I like today's stink.

58:53.360 --> 59:00.140
That sounds like something I would have read on Moondabore's blog.

59:00.140 --> 59:04.460
All the fake Bomani news.

59:04.460 --> 59:09.180
I like today's musk.

59:09.180 --> 59:10.020
Anyway,

59:10.020 --> 59:13.960
the reason why that's kind of part of the Bomani news is that I guess

59:13.960 --> 59:17.340
I don't know how they do this. You're going to have to explain this again, Loki. I know you did.

59:17.340 --> 59:20.860
We went through this once before with Max 1 USA, if you can believe the show's

59:20.860 --> 59:22.300
been on the air that long.

59:22.300 --> 59:26.500
But I guess something to do with the demo disk, you hack

59:26.500 --> 59:29.220
the disk, and you see a master list of songs.

59:29.220 --> 59:32.060
And in that list of songs, we saw Tomorrow Perfume, which

59:32.060 --> 59:34.300
indicates Tomorrow Perfume will be an

59:34.300 --> 59:36.820
unlock in Max 2 USA.

59:36.820 --> 59:37.900
Or not.

59:37.900 --> 59:38.700
Or not.

59:38.700 --> 59:39.180
Or not.

59:39.180 --> 59:40.180
It may be.

59:40.180 --> 59:40.980
It may be.

59:40.980 --> 59:47.140
Because what happens is, and as this was explained by this

59:47.140 --> 59:50.980
guy on the boards called Dancer X, he explained that

59:50.980 --> 59:55.100
with every new home release, there's an updated master list of every single song that's ever

59:55.100 --> 01:00:03.180
been in DDR, pretty much, or so to say, everything that's pretty much in that version of the

01:00:03.180 --> 01:00:08.740
DDR engine or whatever. So, in this case, we're going to have, with this list, it's

01:00:08.740 --> 01:00:16.600
pretty much both what's going to be in Dancing Stage Fever and what's in, going to be in

01:00:16.600 --> 01:00:21.200
Max 2 USA because they both use the same engine, so it's hard to determine what's going to

01:00:21.200 --> 01:00:25.640
be in what. But that was one of the songs that was mentioned in there along with More

01:00:25.640 --> 01:00:29.400
Deep from, I think, isn't that 2DX6 style or something like that?

01:00:29.400 --> 01:00:33.880
I saw, yeah. Yeah, that's going to be in there. But those

01:00:33.880 --> 01:00:38.880
are some of the ones that are supposed to be in there. There's another one, one of the

01:00:38.880 --> 01:00:44.560
ones that kind of grabbed people's attention was, and it's a really odd name, is called

01:00:44.560 --> 01:00:53.860
max and then there's a period after it. So I guess either it's just like max or max period.

01:00:53.860 --> 01:00:59.500
Was max unlimited also in the list? Yes, same with Legend of Max. Someone also thought it

01:00:59.500 --> 01:01:03.440
might be Paranoia Survivor Max but that was also in the list. Could the period just be

01:01:03.440 --> 01:01:10.840
funky Japanese writing? I don't know. It probably not because each song has a pretty much a

01:01:10.840 --> 01:01:17.640
a four letter ID for it. And so, it's not going to necessarily be funky writing. Like

01:01:17.640 --> 01:01:22.120
for instance, if it was like, you know, one of the Japanese songs, you know, like Freckles

01:01:22.120 --> 01:01:29.680
or whatever or, you know, something with Japanese writing, it would be spelled out in Romangi.

01:01:29.680 --> 01:01:34.560
Now because of this hacking of the disk, they've kind of had to go and reveal some things,

01:01:34.560 --> 01:01:39.520
some more things about DDR Max 2 USA. And I've always kind of hated this, I know something

01:01:39.520 --> 01:01:47.680
you don't know business about Max 2, I understand the desire to create like, I don't know what

01:01:47.680 --> 01:01:54.480
you'd call it, like people wanting to drool, not superiority, just wanting to surprise

01:01:54.480 --> 01:01:59.120
people or whatever, wanting to tease things and stuff like that. But you know, the guessing

01:01:59.120 --> 01:02:04.480
games and all that garbage, sometimes it kind of makes me wish they'd stay out of it. You

01:02:04.480 --> 01:02:05.840
You know what I mean?

01:02:05.840 --> 01:02:08.480
I don't know.

01:02:08.480 --> 01:02:11.120
I just don't like the whole fact that there's this whole,

01:02:11.120 --> 01:02:12.960
I know something you don't know attitude about a lot of

01:02:12.960 --> 01:02:16.680
this stuff, and it just makes me bitter.

01:02:16.680 --> 01:02:18.800
Anyway, here's what we do know.

01:02:18.800 --> 01:02:20.280
Here's what we've been told.

01:02:20.280 --> 01:02:23.240
When they hacked the disk, they tried to bring up the

01:02:23.240 --> 01:02:24.020
song samples.

01:02:24.020 --> 01:02:27.640
Because if you remember when the Max 1 disk was hacked,

01:02:27.640 --> 01:02:30.040
they were able to get song samples, and that's how they

01:02:30.040 --> 01:02:32.240
found that there was a drop to bomb remix on there, is that

01:02:32.240 --> 01:02:36.540
somebody hacked out the sound sample from the demo disc. Well, they got smarter this

01:02:36.540 --> 01:02:40.600
time and none of those samples are in there. It just had the four samples for the songs

01:02:40.600 --> 01:02:46.040
but it had a Midnight Blaze remix in there which has been revealed to be the information

01:02:46.040 --> 01:02:52.320
screen music. Whoop-a-doo. And for those who don't know, it's probably the same damn remix

01:02:52.320 --> 01:03:05.200
that was on the V-Rare CD with Max 2. Ooh, don't care. And then what else did we learn

01:03:05.200 --> 01:03:06.200
because of this?

01:03:06.200 --> 01:03:07.200
Feelings Won't Fade.

01:03:07.200 --> 01:03:12.880
Feelings Won't Fade, that's another song that's going to be in there because, gee, did I call

01:03:12.880 --> 01:03:19.600
that before? Well, Feelings Won't Fade was the credit music in Max 2 Japanese, so I don't

01:03:19.600 --> 01:03:20.600
It just kind of makes sense.

01:03:20.600 --> 01:03:25.180
It's another System SF song and people like that, so whatever.

01:03:25.180 --> 01:03:29.000
What else do we hear about?

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:34.680
MAX-II US has a color-coded song system, meaning that kind of like how MAX-II Japan, you had

01:03:34.680 --> 01:03:37.060
all these different colors of songs in there.

01:03:37.060 --> 01:03:42.640
You had the new songs were one color, the old songs were another color, the ONI remixes

01:03:42.640 --> 01:03:43.640
were another color.

01:03:43.640 --> 01:03:45.680
They're going to do that as well with this.

01:03:45.680 --> 01:03:52.080
And so default songs are green, that are new to the US, 27 of them.

01:03:52.080 --> 01:03:54.600
Repeats US songs, because there was a few of those in there.

01:03:54.600 --> 01:03:58.100
I believe Shining Polaris is coming back, and there's a few others, I think, Silent

01:03:58.100 --> 01:04:00.340
Hills one.

01:04:00.340 --> 01:04:01.340
Repeats are blue.

01:04:01.340 --> 01:04:03.460
There's 13 repeats.

01:04:03.460 --> 01:04:08.340
Unlocks are yellow, and there's 20 unlocks, pretty good amount.

01:04:08.340 --> 01:04:12.340
Challenge step unlocks are purple, and there's seven of them.

01:04:12.340 --> 01:04:16.960
the special red unlocks, there's two of them, which, assumably, have been maxed, unlimited,

01:04:16.960 --> 01:04:23.720
and calculated. Yeah, pretty much. I don't know. I'm still, I don't believe that there's

01:04:23.720 --> 01:04:29.100
not the samples on the disk because they're lazy and stupid and they're gonna leave crap

01:04:29.100 --> 01:04:33.920
like that. They fuck up every single US mix ever made. Every single one's been fucked

01:04:33.920 --> 01:04:40.400
up in some way and lazy in some way as far as, you know, so I'm gonna look myself on

01:04:40.400 --> 01:04:45.440
in this disc to see if I can fight it. Just because they might have not found it the conventional

01:04:45.440 --> 01:04:54.440
way doesn't mean it's not still there. Burning heat's been confirmed, it's an unlock. What

01:04:54.440 --> 01:04:59.560
else did they confirm? Oh yes, the oni mode is not in the game. Oni mode will not be in

01:04:59.560 --> 01:05:06.040
the game. Nonstop, yes. Oni mode, no. I prefer nonstop. And in it's place, in oni mode's

01:05:06.040 --> 01:05:15.560
place will be challenge mode. Like the challenge on fourth mix type stuff? That's cool. That's

01:05:15.560 --> 01:05:18.440
what I heard is going to be the difference. They're going to have a challenge mode to

01:05:18.440 --> 01:05:25.600
unlock these things. And I like that better to be honest because I think Oni's are retarded.

01:05:25.600 --> 01:05:30.280
But that's what they're going to be doing I guess. Here's why Oni's are retarded and

01:05:30.280 --> 01:05:35.400
I'm glad they're staying in the arcade. Because playing on a home pad, you miss all the fucking

01:05:35.400 --> 01:05:40.940
time. It's just part of playing at home. I don't care if you have Ignition 59.0 or whatever

01:05:40.940 --> 01:05:46.480
dance pad that's top of the line. You still, it's not as good as the real hundreds and

01:05:46.480 --> 01:05:51.540
hundreds of dollars metal stage you play out on the arcade. Thank you. So nonstop was a

01:05:51.540 --> 01:05:52.540
better choice.

01:05:52.540 --> 01:05:53.620
Three John.

01:05:53.620 --> 01:05:58.380
But it's just weird that they have, now that explains it, Loki, because I had a question.

01:05:58.380 --> 01:06:03.600
How is it that they have the challenge step songs as unlocks when there's no Oni mode

01:06:03.600 --> 01:06:07.160
or challenge mode or whatever they're calling it in the US. That makes sense to me

01:06:07.160 --> 01:06:08.060
because I'm kinda like

01:06:08.060 --> 01:06:11.220
wait a minute, so you're not gonna have only mode but you're gonna have these only unlocked songs

01:06:11.220 --> 01:06:15.580
and you're gonna have, unless they go back and make basic trick and maniac steps

01:06:15.580 --> 01:06:16.980
which I doubt they will

01:06:16.980 --> 01:06:23.120
they're only gonna have one set of steps. Hopefully I'll be pleasantly

01:06:23.120 --> 01:06:25.860
surprised if somebody's gone back and made basic and trick steps

01:06:25.860 --> 01:06:30.220
because we all, I think we all can, we all have accepted that the challenge steps will just be

01:06:30.220 --> 01:06:31.020
the maniac steps.

01:06:31.020 --> 01:06:32.460
They can do it in five minutes.

01:06:32.460 --> 01:06:33.180
Loki can do it.

01:06:33.180 --> 01:06:36.460
Loki will come make steps for you.

01:06:36.460 --> 01:06:39.220
Well, no, what's sad is they have steps for a few songs,

01:06:39.220 --> 01:06:43.020
like, for instance, Hysteria 2001 and Before You, Before

01:06:43.020 --> 01:06:43.780
There's a Beat Mix.

01:06:43.780 --> 01:06:44.940
They're both in Euromix, too.

01:06:44.940 --> 01:06:48.380
They have their own basic and trick steps for it.

01:06:48.380 --> 01:06:53.780
They're just too lazy to put those over into the US mixes.

01:06:53.780 --> 01:06:55.100
It's sad.

01:06:55.100 --> 01:06:56.060
We think.

01:06:56.060 --> 01:06:58.060
We speculate to this point.

01:06:58.060 --> 01:06:59.540
We won't know for sure until September 24.

01:06:59.540 --> 01:07:06.540
I'm still not making a comment.

01:07:06.540 --> 01:07:07.460
I'm still

01:07:07.460 --> 01:07:11.660
going on record saying I'm supporting whatever Konami is going to do.

01:07:11.660 --> 01:07:13.180
Officially supporting.

01:07:13.180 --> 01:07:14.820
I'll have the game.

01:07:14.820 --> 01:07:18.920
I don't think there's any doubt that any of us, that we're going to buy the

01:07:18.920 --> 01:07:20.500
game. It will be

01:07:20.500 --> 01:07:24.260
it'll be the best mix to date, home release to date. There's no doubt about

01:07:24.260 --> 01:07:25.220
that.

01:07:25.220 --> 01:07:27.400
So we all know that MaxUSA

01:07:27.400 --> 01:07:31.060
blew everything else out of the way. It blew Max Japan out of the water. I'm sorry. I don't

01:07:31.060 --> 01:07:36.460
care what you think about the Japanese. It was superior in every way to Max Japan. And

01:07:36.460 --> 01:07:40.980
Max 2 USA will probably be superior in every way to Max Japan. But as rabid fans, we're

01:07:40.980 --> 01:07:49.980
going to bitch about everything that wasn't done the way we wanted it to. So, that being

01:07:49.980 --> 01:07:55.820
said, I believe that covers everything that's been confirmed this week for Max 2 USA. Do

01:07:55.820 --> 01:07:57.120
Do we know any more of those songs?

01:07:57.120 --> 01:07:58.680
I was trying to find that list of songs

01:07:58.680 --> 01:07:59.960
that were found in the hacks.

01:07:59.960 --> 01:08:02.040
I know one that kind of struck me as interesting

01:08:02.040 --> 01:08:04.580
was Don't Call Me Baby by Madison Avenue,

01:08:04.580 --> 01:08:07.000
because I haven't seen that announced for either game yet.

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:09.200
So it's an unlock in one of the games.

01:08:09.200 --> 01:08:11.000
More than likely, probably, the European one,

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:13.280
because I don't think they have as much of the European lists

01:08:13.280 --> 01:08:13.960
to do this one.

01:08:17.600 --> 01:08:22.680
So some of the other ones, I think, were in there.

01:08:22.680 --> 01:08:24.400
I'm trying to look up the list here.

01:08:24.400 --> 01:08:29.280
I think Turn the Beat Around was another one, maybe, or Saturday Night Fever or something

01:08:29.280 --> 01:08:30.280
like that.

01:08:30.280 --> 01:08:35.760
There was one that was an old school song that I just can't remember which one it was.

01:08:35.760 --> 01:08:36.960
There's a bunch of stuff on there.

01:08:36.960 --> 01:08:43.240
There's another Spice Girls song in there, I think.

01:08:43.240 --> 01:08:50.000
But that's obviously going to be friggin' European, so yay!

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:52.000
Don't care.

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:58.440
Anyway, that's the big Bahmani news this week.

01:08:58.440 --> 01:09:02.080
I haven't really heard of anything else going on in the Bahmani world this week.

01:09:02.080 --> 01:09:05.080
Anybody know anything interesting going on otherwise?

01:09:05.080 --> 01:09:07.080
Not that I've noticed.

01:09:07.080 --> 01:09:08.080
What?

01:09:08.080 --> 01:09:09.640
I haven't really noticed anything.

01:09:09.640 --> 01:09:13.160
I think that the only activity is going on over here.

01:09:13.160 --> 01:09:14.160
What?

01:09:14.160 --> 01:09:15.160
The Max2USA?

01:09:15.160 --> 01:09:18.680
Yeah, I think that's really the only thing going on.

01:09:18.680 --> 01:09:23.280
We have Extreme in Japan coming out in October, but I think we all kind of know what to expect,

01:09:23.280 --> 01:09:26.480
because the Japanese ones, we always know what to expect, because they're going to be

01:09:26.480 --> 01:09:28.560
just like the arcade ones, pretty much.

01:09:28.560 --> 01:09:32.920
It's just the song list is always a question, and what's going to be an unlock, and hopefully

01:09:32.920 --> 01:09:35.280
Extreme Japan doesn't suck.

01:09:35.280 --> 01:09:39.700
There's a lot of people always already kind of pushing it and selling it as it's going

01:09:39.700 --> 01:09:42.080
to be the best home release yet.

01:09:42.080 --> 01:09:44.280
It's going to be even better than Max 2 USA.

01:09:44.280 --> 01:09:47.140
Personally, I doubt it's going to be better than Max 2 USA.

01:09:47.140 --> 01:09:50.320
I just, Extreme just sucked for me.

01:09:50.320 --> 01:09:51.320
Even the arcade version.

01:09:51.320 --> 01:09:57.100
I mean, sure, it had an assload of songs, but not that many new, new, new, new songs.

01:09:57.100 --> 01:09:59.460
Just a bunch of recycled shit from other games.

01:09:59.460 --> 01:10:03.720
I actually say that Extreme got me back into playing DDR.

01:10:03.720 --> 01:10:07.500
I think Extreme scared me away from DDR.

01:10:07.500 --> 01:10:09.020
I'm not a big fan of Extreme.

01:10:09.020 --> 01:10:13.220
I think, honestly, when it all said and done, I think I'm just really bitter at the fact

01:10:13.220 --> 01:10:16.220
that the Dance Mania tracks were...

01:10:16.220 --> 01:10:20.020
was like what seven of them licensed and they weren't that great there was maybe

01:10:20.020 --> 01:10:24.260
two good ones out of the whole bunch and just I like it for playing all the old

01:10:24.260 --> 01:10:29.220
stuff yeah I don't know it's half the time I go there I didn't played stuff

01:10:29.220 --> 01:10:34.380
from 2dx or sort of a solo if I want to play a 2dx song I'm gonna play 2dx I

01:10:34.380 --> 01:10:38.980
don't I don't like dancing the a it's kind of stupid well then don't play a I

01:10:38.980 --> 01:10:45.040
don't mean I don't dance to be either the only 2dx songs like a holic every

01:10:45.040 --> 01:10:46.240
Every time I play.

01:10:46.240 --> 01:10:48.560
I play stoic.

01:10:48.560 --> 01:10:49.560
That's kind of fun to dance to.

01:10:49.560 --> 01:10:55.680
It has interesting steps that are challenging, but it's a whole extreme.

01:10:55.680 --> 01:10:58.760
What's weird is I actually have been getting back into DDR more lately.

01:10:58.760 --> 01:11:02.800
I've been playing a little more DDR lately, but it's been any machine I can find really.

01:11:02.800 --> 01:11:04.000
It's not just extreme.

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:05.800
I played fourth plus yesterday.

01:11:05.800 --> 01:11:10.420
I had a ball until I almost killed myself playing too many hard songs.

01:11:10.420 --> 01:11:13.000
That's what I get for being out of shape, by the way.

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:16.420
I play a bunch of catastrophes back to back and I almost have an asthma attack in the

01:11:16.420 --> 01:11:19.180
military arcade.

01:11:19.180 --> 01:11:23.100
But I'll just have to practice more often.

01:11:23.100 --> 01:11:26.300
Here's some of the songs that were on there.

01:11:26.300 --> 01:11:27.480
Some of the new ones on the list.

01:11:27.480 --> 01:11:31.500
Come on Eileen, Groove is in the Heart, Stayin' Alive.

01:11:31.500 --> 01:11:32.500
That was the one.

01:11:32.500 --> 01:11:37.040
I was thinking of Stayin' Alive, Get Down Tonight.

01:11:37.040 --> 01:11:38.440
Then they have, of course, Take Me Away.

01:11:38.440 --> 01:11:40.200
That's one of the ones.

01:11:40.200 --> 01:11:46.320
A Stupid Barber, Teenage Kicks, Scorching Moon, A Little Bit of Ecstasy, All That She

01:11:46.320 --> 01:11:54.080
Wants, Ace of Base, Of Course Heaven, Cool For Cats, Jump Around, One Step Beyond, The

01:11:54.080 --> 01:12:00.320
Boys Are Back in Town, 20-20 Vision, Dizzy, Virtuality, Music, The Bowstick Remix, which

01:12:00.320 --> 01:12:05.140
is by Darude, and then of course Busy Child and Feelings Won't Fade. Those are the new

01:12:05.140 --> 01:12:12.220
licensed songs. Bad Routine was another one that was in there, and More Deep version.21,

01:12:12.220 --> 01:12:13.220
or whatever.

01:12:13.220 --> 01:12:17.500
I want someone to do a routine to Bad Routine.

01:12:17.500 --> 01:12:22.160
And Keep on Lifting from last time. Remember how I said Keep on Lifting? No Nemesis, makes

01:12:22.160 --> 01:12:23.160
me sad.

01:12:23.160 --> 01:12:28.620
Yeah, no Nemesis. What happened there? Nemesis would be kind of... It's not a dance song.

01:12:28.620 --> 01:12:34.500
I'm sorry. Whoever cut that, it was a good idea. I hope they put something else in this

01:12:34.500 --> 01:12:46.700
Max period. Who knows? I think it's just something to screw with people. I think it's just something

01:12:46.700 --> 01:12:47.700
to screw with people.

01:12:47.700 --> 01:12:48.700
Maybe it's just a placeholder.

01:12:48.700 --> 01:12:53.900
I think it's a... I don't think it means shit. Maybe it's something for challenge mode. Who

01:12:53.900 --> 01:12:54.900
knows?

01:12:54.900 --> 01:12:59.460
But that would be cool if it wasn't. Yes. Yes, it would be.

01:13:29.460 --> 01:13:35.060
best DDR game yet. It's got nothing but licensed songs from all these decades of music. It's

01:13:35.060 --> 01:13:41.660
got the fucking Spice Girls. That's rad. But the weirdest thing about it is that it's

01:13:41.660 --> 01:13:50.980
for the PS2 and PS1. I find that very strange that they made a version for each system.

01:13:50.980 --> 01:13:53.940
So do you think they'll run off different engines or something? Or what do you think

01:13:53.940 --> 01:13:58.300
will happen? I bet you the CD one won't have the videos, obviously. It'll probably be a

01:13:58.300 --> 01:14:02.300
to be a fifth mix. Pretty much. I think it's going to be fifth mix engine and you're going

01:14:02.300 --> 01:14:08.780
to have the other one that's just, I don't know, probably just max two obviously. But

01:14:08.780 --> 01:14:14.260
because it's a PS1 version, I can import that because I have a modded, you know, PlayStation

01:14:14.260 --> 01:14:25.540
stuff. That'd be cool. You're special. Okay. Any, why don't you tell us about what's going

01:14:55.540 --> 01:15:01.580
huge dance song here. I guess the question would be, somebody's got to determine where

01:15:01.580 --> 01:15:04.760
they're really licensing these songs from and you could probably figure it out with

01:15:04.760 --> 01:15:09.540
the record companies involved in everything. Like, what, EuroMix II had stuff licensed

01:15:09.540 --> 01:15:16.820
from Zomba, right? But it was never really said where the licenses from the last Max

01:15:16.820 --> 01:15:23.500
USA was coming from. SyFam, but Sandstorm's not a SyFam song, so there's somebody else

01:15:23.500 --> 01:15:34.380
involved too. So, who knows? Who knows? Please put my song in DVR. I need exposure.

01:15:34.380 --> 01:15:37.780
Maybe that. Maybe, in the case of Steve Reiner. But hey,

01:15:37.780 --> 01:15:40.860
Dark Black Forest, I know a lot of people think it's played out.

01:15:40.860 --> 01:15:44.180
It's the most annoying song ever. Whatever. I totally disagree. I think it was

01:15:44.180 --> 01:15:47.020
the best licensed song they had in Max USA, and I think it's awesome.

01:15:47.020 --> 01:15:51.260
I would like Sandstorm better. If I had to admit, their cover for Dancing

01:15:51.260 --> 01:15:54.260
This age figure is pretty gay.

01:15:54.260 --> 01:15:57.580
It's really retarded.

01:15:57.580 --> 01:16:00.100
I want to set that girl on fire.

01:16:00.100 --> 01:16:01.740
Anyway, we'll be back.

01:16:01.740 --> 01:16:04.300
And I think I played this song last week, but I don't care

01:16:04.300 --> 01:16:05.580
because the song rules.

01:16:05.580 --> 01:16:09.060
And Jamie wanted to hear more DDR songs tonight, so I'm

01:16:09.060 --> 01:16:10.540
going to play a DDR song I want to hear.

01:16:10.540 --> 01:16:12.740
And it's going to be in Max 2 USA, and that is good.

01:16:12.740 --> 01:16:13.740
Okay.

01:17:42.740 --> 01:18:08.860
You got an easy day, you got an easy day

01:18:08.860 --> 01:18:11.180
Someone call me, call me

01:18:11.180 --> 01:18:14.340
Shizuka in a room, there in the city

01:18:14.340 --> 01:18:17.540
So I'll take you to the north of me

01:18:17.540 --> 01:18:20.740
You've got a busy day, you've got a busy day

01:18:20.740 --> 01:18:23.220
I kill a man, you're all alone

01:18:23.220 --> 01:18:26.180
You do that, get the hug, you do that on your own

01:18:26.180 --> 01:18:29.020
You can't sit here, dashing in

01:18:29.020 --> 01:18:32.340
All that you do is tell me

01:18:32.340 --> 01:18:35.260
That I love you, can't let go of me

01:18:35.260 --> 01:18:37.540
But no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

01:18:37.540 --> 01:18:41.540
Yeah, ooh, tell ya, you got the moves

01:18:41.540 --> 01:18:44.540
You can't lie down, no, don't go down

01:18:44.540 --> 01:18:47.540
So go ahead and make me shine

01:18:47.540 --> 01:18:50.540
Come on, come on, rockin' like a song

01:18:50.540 --> 01:18:53.540
Can you meet on the count of money on it?

01:18:53.540 --> 01:18:55.540
Yeah, so me and you go and you can't

01:18:55.540 --> 01:18:59.540
Can you meet on the count of money on it?

01:18:59.540 --> 01:19:02.540
Jesus knows I'm ready for the way down

01:20:59.540 --> 01:21:15.540
Please listen to Orange Lounge Radio because real radio makes Captain Jack cry.

01:21:15.540 --> 01:21:27.940
Hello everybody and welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio episode.59.

01:21:27.940 --> 01:21:33.620
We're back after some discussion on Max2USA and How Was Your Week, How Was Your Day.

01:21:33.620 --> 01:21:37.180
Shark Skrull's been gone for what, about 30 minutes now I'd say?

01:21:37.180 --> 01:21:38.180
Not that long.

01:21:38.180 --> 01:21:39.180
Not that long?

01:21:39.180 --> 01:21:43.020
Where in the world is Melody?

01:21:43.020 --> 01:21:44.460
At my house probably.

01:21:44.460 --> 01:21:47.780
I'm not funny at all today, I understand that.

01:21:47.780 --> 01:21:52.100
And our anti-funny is Rob.

01:21:52.100 --> 01:22:02.340
You are a, yeah, my anti-fun is wrong. Anyway, Loki, how about a sim update, sir? Oh, you

01:22:02.340 --> 01:22:12.860
want me to do stuff? Okay. But anyways, let's see, StepMania came out with Beta 4 Alpha

01:22:12.860 --> 01:22:19.380
4, I don't know what the fuck they're on now. I think it's like Alpha 4 Beta something.

01:22:49.380 --> 01:22:53.100
Real much going on other than, you know, tons of SIM files coming out.

01:22:53.100 --> 01:22:57.820
Shoei released another part of the DDR SIM file history collection.

01:22:58.300 --> 01:23:05.300
More files from sites you've never heard of and other than that, like I said, not too much.

01:23:05.380 --> 01:23:10.720
Pretty much if you're looking for SIM files, there are a couple places you can go.

01:23:10.720 --> 01:23:14.820
Go to DDR Maniacs and check out in the community news section,

01:23:14.820 --> 01:23:21.620
there's something about the sim file DC hub, that's direct connect hub. You'll find a bunch

01:23:21.620 --> 01:23:26.840
of people in there with thousands of files that you can go leech off of. Also, there's

01:23:26.840 --> 01:23:32.420
going to be, you know, Bamai style which you can find a bunch of cool stuff there. And

01:23:32.420 --> 01:23:38.180
then you can also get on your, off your ass and go do some searches on the internet and

01:23:38.180 --> 01:23:45.280
find your damn files yourself, you lazy bastard. So, ha, I have to laugh about, oh yeah, there's

01:23:45.280 --> 01:23:50.000
some thing going on with DDR Freak about getting official SIM file collections because, you

01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:53.720
know, no one has them anymore except for me and, you know, they can go fuck themselves

01:23:53.720 --> 01:24:02.400
because, not DDR Freak but the project. The project that just happens to be on DDR Freak

01:24:02.400 --> 01:24:06.640
Because, you know, I'm not sharing.

01:24:06.640 --> 01:24:11.800
So, what have we established? A, you're a pirate. R, and B, you're a selfish pirate.

01:24:11.800 --> 01:24:13.840
R, walk me plank.

01:24:13.840 --> 01:24:16.200
You butt-head, you need to be kicked.

01:24:16.200 --> 01:24:19.900
Why? Someone never spanked you when you were little.

01:24:19.900 --> 01:24:23.600
No, but I think she's taking, I think, uh, you know who's taking care of that now

01:24:23.600 --> 01:24:25.240
that, you know, Loki's twenty,

01:24:25.240 --> 01:24:27.320
in his twenties and all.

01:24:27.320 --> 01:24:29.720
I don't get spanked from her.

01:24:29.720 --> 01:24:33.060
Not from her, but, you know, your girlfriend.

01:24:33.060 --> 01:24:34.580
I don't get spanked from her.

01:24:34.580 --> 01:24:35.800
Never?

01:24:35.800 --> 01:24:37.040
Never!

01:24:37.040 --> 01:24:39.040
You guys are boring.

01:24:39.040 --> 01:24:43.280
Hello! TMI alert, thank you.

01:24:43.280 --> 01:24:46.940
No, I mean, like, literally, like, kick his butt a few times.

01:24:46.940 --> 01:24:52.500
Uh-huh, nice recovery. Oh, he's into the rough stuff.

01:24:52.500 --> 01:24:58.840
You know, men need women to keep them in line.

01:24:58.840 --> 01:25:03.000
Not for us, you guys would just fuck this planet up.

01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:04.560
Sure.

01:25:04.560 --> 01:25:08.280
You know, because all those crazy women drivers out there causing accidents,

01:25:08.280 --> 01:25:10.440
tying up our freaking highways and byways.

01:25:10.440 --> 01:25:13.340
Hey, I'm a good driver.

01:25:13.340 --> 01:25:15.840
Yeah.

01:25:15.840 --> 01:25:19.200
Just give me an evil look.

01:25:19.200 --> 01:25:24.560
You are so dead when I'm over my sick.

01:25:24.560 --> 01:25:25.280
You know what?

01:25:25.280 --> 01:25:26.080
You can't hurt me.

01:25:26.080 --> 01:25:27.880
I have the power of plane crashes.

01:25:27.880 --> 01:25:31.960
You're going to catch multiple infection disease from her if you're not careful.

01:25:31.960 --> 01:25:35.160
You know what? I'm immune. Oh my god, Jamie, how's the SARS?

01:25:35.160 --> 01:25:38.560
I do not have SARS. It's monkey pox. I'm immune.

01:25:38.560 --> 01:25:42.280
Oh my god. I heard that SARS was coming back. Like, it was a big thing on Yahoo.

01:25:42.280 --> 01:25:47.360
Hey, be it, you know, it's like, it's like, it's like leaf garret, okay? All of a sudden, SARS

01:25:47.360 --> 01:25:48.600
making a comeback, right?

01:25:48.600 --> 01:25:52.600
And, I, what if you have SARS, Jamie? I don't have SARS.

01:25:52.600 --> 01:25:56.120
How do you know? I've never been to China.

01:25:56.120 --> 01:25:59.120
Have you been in contact with any Canadians lately?

01:26:00.120 --> 01:26:02.120
Namely in the Toronto area?

01:26:03.120 --> 01:26:05.120
Is Marin Chan the secretly Canadian?

01:26:06.120 --> 01:26:08.120
Oh my God, my spinners are coming from Toronto.

01:26:09.120 --> 01:26:10.120
They're probably laced with SARS.

01:26:11.120 --> 01:26:12.120
Oh my God, they're SARS infested spinners.

01:26:13.120 --> 01:26:14.120
You can shut up.

01:26:16.120 --> 01:26:21.120
Okay, before we get killed, I think now's a good time to get into the Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match.

01:26:22.120 --> 01:26:24.120
I'm ready for the fuck yous of the week.

01:26:24.120 --> 01:26:50.120
I still think this song is still my word.

01:26:54.120 --> 01:27:03.960
called Face the Change, and it's remixed by Dirt Devils and Above and Beyond, very cool.

01:27:03.960 --> 01:27:09.420
They do a lot of great remixes. They did Madonna's What it Feels Like for a Girl video remix,

01:27:09.420 --> 01:27:13.620
and they also did M, Yumi Hamasaki's M, which is a great sim file.

01:27:13.620 --> 01:27:19.220
Alright, here it is, last week's winner, and this first song you can vote for in the Orange

01:27:19.220 --> 01:27:26.060

01:27:35.200 --> 01:27:40.540
one. This is Every Little Thing, Cyber Trance with Face the Change, Dirt Devils and Above

01:27:40.540 --> 01:27:44.020
and Beyond Remix. And you only hear a clip of it because it won last week. Here it is.

01:27:44.020 --> 01:27:53.120
See you all in the next video!

01:28:14.020 --> 01:28:16.020
Oh

01:29:14.020 --> 01:29:43.780
Oops, dead air, sorry.

01:29:43.780 --> 01:29:44.780
Sorry.

01:29:44.780 --> 01:29:45.780
Good air.

01:29:45.780 --> 01:29:46.780
My bad.

01:29:46.780 --> 01:29:50.780
You want to take the next song, Jamie, or you want me to?

01:29:50.780 --> 01:29:51.780
Why not?

01:29:51.780 --> 01:29:52.780
You're going to do it?

01:29:52.780 --> 01:29:53.780
Yeah, why not?

01:29:53.780 --> 01:29:54.780
Are you okay?

01:29:54.780 --> 01:29:55.780
I'm having a nap.

01:29:55.780 --> 01:29:56.780
You sound sleepy.

01:29:56.780 --> 01:29:57.780
I'm taking a nap.

01:29:57.780 --> 01:29:58.780
Okay.

01:29:58.780 --> 01:30:01.780
Well, before you nap, tell us about your song pick for this week.

01:30:01.780 --> 01:30:04.780
It's a remix of Tori Amos' Sugar.

01:30:04.780 --> 01:30:05.780
I'm so proud of Jamie.

01:30:05.780 --> 01:30:07.780
She picked Tori Amos this week.

01:30:07.780 --> 01:30:08.780
Okay.

01:30:08.780 --> 01:30:11.780
It's a good song, and it sounds all dark and depressed.

01:30:11.780 --> 01:30:15.780
This is a dark and depressing trance remix of Tori Amos with Sugar.

01:30:15.780 --> 01:30:18.620
This is song number two you can vote for tonight.

01:30:18.620 --> 01:30:19.620
Dark sacrifice pick.

01:30:19.620 --> 01:30:20.620
Here it is.

01:30:20.620 --> 01:30:21.620
The whole song.

01:30:21.620 --> 01:30:49.620
Don't fight me, I'm not strong Don't save me, I'm too weak

01:30:49.620 --> 01:30:51.620
I'll be there

01:30:54.620 --> 01:30:56.620
Do you like the day?

01:30:56.620 --> 01:30:58.620
Do you like the night?

01:30:58.620 --> 01:31:00.620
Do you like the sun?

01:31:00.620 --> 01:31:02.620
Do you like the day?

01:31:07.620 --> 01:31:09.620
Shilla

01:31:39.620 --> 01:31:43.620
Get in with them

01:31:49.620 --> 01:31:54.620
And sugar, bring me sugar

01:31:57.620 --> 01:32:00.620
And all the ramen free

01:32:01.620 --> 01:32:05.620
Bring me many things for sugar

01:32:05.620 --> 01:32:08.620
You bring me up

01:32:11.620 --> 01:32:14.620
As far as I can tell

01:32:15.620 --> 01:32:18.620
I've been too young to fall

01:32:18.620 --> 01:32:21.620
Just in my heart tonight

01:32:24.620 --> 01:32:28.620
If you were that good

01:32:29.620 --> 01:32:32.620
I don't know me

01:32:32.620 --> 01:32:39.620
And I'm the one you know, you say you found me out

01:33:02.620 --> 01:33:19.740
You bring me sugar, you bring me sugar You know I'd rather bring you, you bring me

01:33:19.740 --> 01:33:23.740
They bring many things but sugar

01:33:24.740 --> 01:33:27.740
It brings me sugar

01:33:29.740 --> 01:33:32.740
And all the rotten things

01:33:33.740 --> 01:33:37.740
They bring many things but sugar

01:33:37.740 --> 01:33:40.740
I wish you love

01:33:48.740 --> 01:33:51.740
I wish you love

01:33:51.740 --> 01:33:53.740
tonight

01:33:53.740 --> 01:33:55.740
tonight

01:34:55.740 --> 01:35:02.740
Okay, that was Tori Amos with Sugar, the trance remix.

01:35:25.740 --> 01:35:28.380
uh... lucky

01:35:28.380 --> 01:35:29.980
and i it was

01:35:29.980 --> 01:35:31.820
mellow

01:35:31.820 --> 01:35:36.020
give it a seven

01:35:36.020 --> 01:35:37.860
i'd reach where you can do no wrong

01:35:37.860 --> 01:35:39.020
uh...

01:35:39.020 --> 01:35:41.520
it's it sounds like a fan remix to me

01:35:41.520 --> 01:35:45.320
i don't know if it sounds a little love

01:35:45.320 --> 01:35:48.380
and what i was a little beyond all it's just what i would like you a little

01:35:48.380 --> 01:35:53.540
agree he was thinking about also look for but it's pretty damn well done

01:35:53.540 --> 01:35:58.960
I can't see myself giving it a ten for some reason, but a nine. Nine and a half, even.

01:35:58.960 --> 01:36:03.460
I do really like that. That was very good. And Tory is the shit.

01:36:03.460 --> 01:36:08.040
I would be a horrible gay man if I were to give Tory a low score.

01:36:08.040 --> 01:36:09.360
Anyway...

01:36:09.360 --> 01:36:10.960
I love that the remix fit the song.

01:36:10.960 --> 01:36:14.860
It does. It does really fit the song. Have you heard the original of that song?

01:36:14.860 --> 01:36:16.360
Not in a very long time.

01:36:16.360 --> 01:36:21.520
Yeah, the remix fits it very well, so whoever remixed that did a damn good job.

01:36:21.520 --> 01:36:22.920
I would not be sad if that won at all.

01:36:22.920 --> 01:36:25.360
I actually like all of tonight's cage match songs.

01:36:25.360 --> 01:36:27.880
Usually there's one I'm kind of like, eh, hope it doesn't win, but tonight, I don't

01:36:27.880 --> 01:36:28.880
care what wins.

01:36:28.880 --> 01:36:29.880
They're all good.

01:36:29.880 --> 01:36:33.880
So, my pick, song number three, now I knew that Loki won last week.

01:36:33.880 --> 01:36:34.880
He had a trance song.

01:36:34.880 --> 01:36:37.120
I knew Jamie was bringing a trance mix.

01:36:37.120 --> 01:36:42.800
So usually when, you know, I know of trance, that there's going to be two trance songs

01:36:42.800 --> 01:36:46.120
and I try to do something different, like crazy, like I'll do something really like

01:36:46.120 --> 01:36:48.320
stupid crazy.

01:36:48.320 --> 01:36:53.080
usually that ends up being a Kylie Minogue song of some sort but tonight I

01:36:53.080 --> 01:36:59.240
thought you know what I don't really want to play Kylie Minogue. Yeah how dare you put Kylie against Tori. Tori would up and kick her ass.

01:36:59.240 --> 01:37:03.940
No so I thought I'm not gonna put in Kylie Minogue instead I'm gonna put in

01:37:03.940 --> 01:37:09.360
her sister Danny Minogue because Danny Minogue is starting a singing career so I'm

01:37:09.360 --> 01:37:13.920
gonna put in a song by her. This is Danny Minogue with Put the Needle on it

01:37:13.920 --> 01:37:17.520
the Jason Nevins ultra pop radio edit and I heard this last night at the club

01:37:17.520 --> 01:37:24.520
and I liked it a lot, so it's my entry for tonight's cage match. Here it is, enjoy.

01:37:47.520 --> 01:37:52.520
I got the place, you got the time, I'm just gettin' my list, did I make you blush?

01:37:52.520 --> 01:38:00.520
I let you in, switch in, the temperature is rising so hot, I may wanna take my clothes off

01:38:00.520 --> 01:38:07.520
You trip inside, you trip inside, let the music make you rise up

01:38:07.520 --> 01:38:14.520
Dirty hand is what I demand, let the music make you rise up

01:40:44.520 --> 01:41:08.640
Dirty hands, I demand Dirty hands, I demand

01:41:08.640 --> 01:41:15.640
uh...

01:41:17.920 --> 01:41:20.320
already a song of the three

01:41:20.320 --> 01:41:22.280
danny minnow put them you want it

01:41:22.280 --> 01:41:23.840
jason evans makes jamie

01:41:23.840 --> 01:41:25.960
it's good for kylie's good for danny

01:41:25.960 --> 01:41:27.800
it's got to be better

01:41:27.800 --> 01:41:30.520
uh... it wasn't that they get sick

01:41:30.520 --> 01:41:33.840
okay

01:41:33.840 --> 01:41:37.000
i'd like to give it a

01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:41.000
You actually told me I had I played like four of them for you and you said that was the best one. I agree

01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:45.540
I like them in my opinion. That's the best one. The remix is awesome. It's it's porno

01:41:45.540 --> 01:41:50.760
It makes me want to do lap dances and pixie dust slap and tug under Kylie underwear

01:41:52.420 --> 01:41:54.420
I'm gonna get killed for that. I

01:41:55.780 --> 01:41:57.780
Like that's not a lie. Give it a night

01:41:58.180 --> 01:42:02.380
So there you go. Those are your three picks for tonight. So here they are

01:42:02.380 --> 01:42:07.440

In case you forgot, here they are again.

01:42:25.380 --> 01:42:30.140
First off, last week's winner, Every Little Thing, Cyber Trance, Face the Change.

01:42:30.140 --> 01:42:39.560
All right, song number two you can vote for tonight.

01:42:39.560 --> 01:42:52.960
Tori Amos with Sugar, the trance remix.

01:42:52.960 --> 01:42:56.960
And of course, song number three, Danny Minow with Put the Needle On It, the Jason Evans mix.

01:43:04.960 --> 01:43:07.960
All right. There you go. Place votes now.

01:43:08.960 --> 01:43:11.960
You know what? I think it's time to rant.

01:43:12.960 --> 01:43:17.960
Not like the FUs of the Week because our chat room has to respond to that too, and they can't do that while they're voting.

01:43:18.960 --> 01:43:20.960
What now, Jamie? Just kidding.

01:43:20.960 --> 01:43:35.960
I love you. Hi. Hi. I'm ranting about retarded people. I just know so you can see my construction

01:43:35.960 --> 01:43:44.480
table on the webcam. That's pretty cool. Let her rant. Don't rant about retarded people.

01:43:44.480 --> 01:43:48.960
They can't help it. I'm talking about people who aren't retarded but act retarded. Oh,

01:43:48.960 --> 01:43:57.040
Okay, just people who have like, people need to go to school before they're allowed on

01:43:57.040 --> 01:43:58.040
the internet.

01:43:58.040 --> 01:44:02.880
And I mean go to school and actually pass like grammar and spelling before they're allowed

01:44:02.880 --> 01:44:03.880
on the internet.

01:44:03.880 --> 01:44:08.400
People need, I think, you know, I was reading on my mailing list for J-list how there's

01:44:08.400 --> 01:44:13.200
like a test for everything in Japan, you know, like your fluency levels, there's a test to

01:44:13.200 --> 01:44:17.080
play baseball good enough, there's tests for everything.

01:44:17.080 --> 01:44:21.680
They need to have tests for everything here where like you have to have a certain level

01:44:21.680 --> 01:44:27.200
of proficiency before you're allowed to breathe or maybe not that extreme.

01:44:27.560 --> 01:44:32.640
But like, you know, you have your internet level proficiency so you, you know, you,

01:44:32.840 --> 01:44:36.700
when you log into the internet you have this number that you can go on the web with

01:44:36.700 --> 01:44:46.540
and be allowed to type or, you know, have your degree of, you know, like with driving too.

01:44:46.540 --> 01:44:50.580
You need to keep testing, but when you reach a certain age,

01:44:50.580 --> 01:44:53.700
you need to take the, I'm still OK to drive test.

01:44:53.700 --> 01:44:56.260
Or then there needs to be a certain age.

01:44:56.260 --> 01:44:59.820
And in some cases, especially with driving, when you get to

01:44:59.820 --> 01:45:01.460
a certain age, you need to take it every year.

01:45:01.460 --> 01:45:02.860
Yes.

01:45:02.860 --> 01:45:05.540
When you get to 65, you have to, in fact, when you're like

01:45:05.540 --> 01:45:07.620
85, you need a monthly exam.

01:45:07.620 --> 01:45:10.140
And they need to make sure that you can see over the

01:45:10.140 --> 01:45:12.580
fucking dashboard.

01:45:12.580 --> 01:45:12.880
Thank you.

01:45:12.880 --> 01:45:17.800
You're also, you also need to, what?

01:45:18.160 --> 01:45:21.620
Especially if you're a little Asian woman in the Bay Area with SUV.

01:45:22.640 --> 01:45:29.280
I also think that you need to be able to pass a test before you can breed.

01:45:30.260 --> 01:45:34.660
You know? I think that that would solve a lot of problems in the world with overpopulation

01:45:35.160 --> 01:45:41.020
and with, you know, with, you need to like take the parental responsibility test.

01:45:41.020 --> 01:45:45.060
You think it wouldn't be that you wouldn't need that much intelligence to be a parent

01:45:45.060 --> 01:45:48.860
I mean, I got this put it in the right hole. I mean, it's pretty much it

01:45:48.860 --> 01:45:56.460
That's that's that in and of itself is just breeding people can fucking fucking fucking fuck all they want to and you know

01:45:56.460 --> 01:45:59.940
Sprout babies like bunnies. I think it's all stuff that they're taking while they're breeding

01:46:00.540 --> 01:46:06.740
But I think that you know, there's there's not many responsible parents around these days, you know, don't you agree?

01:46:07.380 --> 01:46:08.500
and

01:46:08.500 --> 01:46:12.420
You know, I'm talking to the people that I know personally I'd say

01:46:13.180 --> 01:46:17.660
They're fairly responsible with me. I know I'm not responsible enough right now to be a parent

01:46:17.660 --> 01:46:23.140
So I'm not gonna go out and do something. I'm not even responsible enough to own a pet. I have a Shermy

01:46:24.060 --> 01:46:28.100
But Shermy poops in a box and I only have to clean up after her once a day

01:46:29.980 --> 01:46:32.820
Okay, I don't have to change diaper 20 million times a day

01:46:34.980 --> 01:46:36.980
Right, yeah, okay, I

01:46:36.980 --> 01:46:50.160
When I was out and about earlier in the week, I was just noticing little children running

01:46:50.160 --> 01:46:54.420
off to do whatever, and their parents were sitting there on their cell phones having

01:46:54.420 --> 01:47:00.720
conversations while little children are off running around and doing stupid little children

01:47:00.720 --> 01:47:01.720
things.

01:47:01.720 --> 01:47:05.120
It's my big reason for not wanting to go back to golf anymore, not necessarily because the

01:47:05.120 --> 01:47:07.240
machines aren't working.

01:47:07.240 --> 01:47:09.960
It's just the fact that people just say, oh, well, the staff

01:47:09.960 --> 01:47:11.520
will babysit my children.

01:47:11.520 --> 01:47:13.800
Oh my god, I hate that.

01:47:13.800 --> 01:47:16.120
No, you do not talk on the cell phone when your children

01:47:16.120 --> 01:47:16.880
need your attention.

01:47:16.880 --> 01:47:20.040
You can do that when you're driving, OK?

01:47:20.040 --> 01:47:21.440
No.

01:47:21.440 --> 01:47:24.520
That's why, and I was thinking of this when I was listening

01:47:24.520 --> 01:47:32.920
to, I was very, very, I guess, proud when I was listening to

01:47:32.920 --> 01:47:39.800
Vandalas talk about how much time and care he takes with his family. I just wish there

01:47:39.800 --> 01:47:43.640
were more people like that. They should limit families to have only one

01:47:43.640 --> 01:47:49.640
child just like they do in China. But then you're being a fascist. You can't

01:47:49.640 --> 01:47:53.840
literally step in there. This is America, land of the free. It's as great of an idea

01:47:53.840 --> 01:47:58.720
as it sounds. There should be certain people that are limited to one child or zero child.

01:47:58.720 --> 01:47:59.720
It's not possible.

01:47:59.720 --> 01:48:05.400
Child services don't step in for neglect until the child's already dead, left in their car

01:48:05.400 --> 01:48:10.880
for five hours, burned to death, or asphyxiated, or whatever.

01:48:10.880 --> 01:48:15.760
I just really think that it's very sad, and I needed to take a moment to get that out

01:48:15.760 --> 01:48:21.920
of my system, because this is what was on the news just last week, or like with Disneyland,

01:48:21.920 --> 01:48:22.920
with the gum on the rail.

01:48:22.920 --> 01:48:23.920
Stupid child.

01:48:23.920 --> 01:48:24.920
Parent wasn't watching.

01:48:24.920 --> 01:48:30.380
parent wasn't watching, you know. There's probably a little kid looking for a quarter

01:48:30.380 --> 01:48:37.220
on the track and that's how the train derailed. It's, you know, people just take responsibility.

01:48:37.220 --> 01:48:43.180
Now, since I brought up Disneyland again, all the cool rides have gone away because

01:48:43.180 --> 01:48:47.820
of stupid people. I mean, look at, like, the people mover. The people mover, while slow,

01:48:47.820 --> 01:48:51.820
was a good way... They did not get rid of the people mover. Yes, they did. Oh, my God.

01:48:51.820 --> 01:48:52.820
They got rid of the people mover!

01:48:52.820 --> 01:48:53.820
They got rid of the people mover!

01:48:53.820 --> 01:48:57.220
Disneyland did not get rid of the people mover, did they?

01:48:57.220 --> 01:48:59.180
Yeah, like, you can go to hell!

01:48:59.180 --> 01:49:00.580
I hope all their rides derail.

01:49:00.580 --> 01:49:04.020
The people mover was the coolest thing on the entire planet, and if they got rid of

01:49:04.020 --> 01:49:05.020
it, ugh!

01:49:05.020 --> 01:49:06.020
Ooh!

01:49:06.020 --> 01:49:07.020
You know why they got rid of it?

01:49:07.020 --> 01:49:10.300
Cuz some dumb fuck thought it'd be a cool idea to rock the thing and it fell over.

01:49:10.300 --> 01:49:11.700
Well, then kill him!

01:49:11.700 --> 01:49:12.700
Just kill him!

01:49:12.700 --> 01:49:14.340
Put, give me a gun, I'll shoot the fucker myself!

01:49:14.340 --> 01:49:16.060
Well, actually, he did die.

01:49:16.060 --> 01:49:18.340
Don't tell me they got rid of Mr. Toad's Wild Rider.

01:49:18.340 --> 01:49:19.340
No, they didn't get rid of that.

01:49:19.340 --> 01:49:20.340
I'm driving to Anaheim right now.

01:49:20.340 --> 01:49:27.860
I don't know how they got rid of Autopia too, didn't they?

01:49:27.860 --> 01:49:30.940
No, it's not gone, but it's not working.

01:49:30.940 --> 01:49:35.860
Are they going to get rid of the teacups because someone got sick?

01:49:35.860 --> 01:49:40.220
Look, you stupid bitch, you can see how the ride works, you're going to spin around and

01:49:40.220 --> 01:49:43.460
around and around and around about a thousand goddamn times.

01:49:43.460 --> 01:49:47.060
If you don't think you can't handle it without puking, then fuck off.

01:49:47.060 --> 01:49:50.980
What else did they get rid of? They replaced the people where there's these things called

01:49:50.980 --> 01:50:00.860
rocket rods. They're basically these things that go really fast. They just have the acceleration

01:50:00.860 --> 01:50:06.900
rate on them. It's just ungodly huge. But that's the problem. I don't know. Someone

01:50:06.900 --> 01:50:12.540
did something in that one, stood up or something, and they died too on that. So that's why those

01:50:12.540 --> 01:50:13.540
guys...

01:50:13.540 --> 01:50:19.060
them it's a small world they will never ever have to have it again oh god I wish

01:50:19.060 --> 01:50:24.060
it's a small world is so lame the other thing is that it takes someone dying and

01:50:24.060 --> 01:50:27.580
then they get rid of things that other people haven't they better not get rid of

01:50:27.580 --> 01:50:30.940
Thunder Mountain Railroad that ride rocked okay no they're probably gonna

01:50:30.940 --> 01:50:38.420
turn it into you know like I don't know Daffy Ducks you know piano adventure I

01:50:38.420 --> 01:50:38.920
I don't know.

01:50:38.920 --> 01:50:40.340
I'm thinking about your rabbit.

01:50:40.340 --> 01:50:42.860
Piano Adventures is a piano on a track.

01:50:42.860 --> 01:50:43.840
It's a runaway piano.

01:50:45.840 --> 01:50:48.300
People do not know what the People Mover is in our chat

01:50:48.300 --> 01:50:48.540
room.

01:50:48.540 --> 01:50:50.860
That's fine, because we have people from all parts

01:50:50.860 --> 01:50:52.140
of the world that listen to Orin's Entrada.

01:50:52.140 --> 01:50:54.020
The People Mover is a ride at Disneyland.

01:50:54.020 --> 01:50:56.020
It's in Tomorrow World, because Disneyland is broken up

01:50:56.020 --> 01:50:57.100
in all these little areas.

01:50:57.100 --> 01:51:01.500
You have the New Orleans section and the jungle section,

01:51:01.500 --> 01:51:04.100
and you have Tomorrowland, which is all the futuristic stuff.

01:51:04.100 --> 01:51:05.940
That's where the Star Wars ride is.

01:51:05.940 --> 01:51:06.420
We all know.

01:51:06.420 --> 01:51:07.060
Yeah.

01:51:07.060 --> 01:51:09.420
50 years ago, anyway, was the Tomorrow stuff.

01:51:09.420 --> 01:51:11.820
But that's where Captain Neo was.

01:51:11.820 --> 01:51:15.100
That's where Space Mountain is.

01:51:15.100 --> 01:51:17.900
Anyway, so People Mover was this little ride.

01:51:17.900 --> 01:51:19.220
And you sat on it.

01:51:19.220 --> 01:51:21.580
And it was like a little trolley.

01:51:21.580 --> 01:51:23.200
And you went all around Tomorrow World.

01:51:23.200 --> 01:51:25.100
And it gave you a little lecture about all the little

01:51:25.100 --> 01:51:26.380
things that were going on.

01:51:26.380 --> 01:51:30.380
But at the end of it, it would say something about you got

01:51:30.380 --> 01:51:32.340
put in the middle of Tron or something.

01:51:32.340 --> 01:51:35.300
And all the walls would start flashing all these pictures.

01:51:35.300 --> 01:51:38.380
and it felt like you're going like a thousand miles an hour because the pictures are flying

01:51:38.380 --> 01:51:42.360
by so fast and it was not it was narrated by Tim Curry

01:51:42.360 --> 01:51:48.560
and if they got rid of the people mover Disneyland could go fuck itself

01:51:48.560 --> 01:51:51.960
there was too big of a line for me to go on the people mover the one time I've been

01:51:51.960 --> 01:51:54.660
see that was the funny thing is it wasn't

01:51:54.660 --> 01:51:55.480
every time

01:51:55.480 --> 01:51:57.620
no one used to go on the people mover because it was like

01:51:57.620 --> 01:51:58.340
ooh

01:51:58.340 --> 01:52:01.540
people mover is space mountain we'll go on space mountain

01:52:01.540 --> 01:52:05.780
People over are just like, I'm tired of walking, I just want to sit down for a little bit.

01:52:05.780 --> 01:52:09.260
You know they've already been doing Space Mountain now.

01:52:09.260 --> 01:52:10.800
Space Mountain is closed for

01:52:10.800 --> 01:52:12.340
renovations.

01:52:12.340 --> 01:52:16.400
Yeah, because it sucks, it's old. I've only been on it once, so it was fun for me, but...

01:52:16.400 --> 01:52:19.420
You need like techno music in there.

01:52:19.420 --> 01:52:20.480
That rock.

01:52:20.480 --> 01:52:21.980
Well anyway, um...

01:52:21.980 --> 01:52:24.700
Back to, what was I ranting about? Stupid people?

01:52:24.700 --> 01:52:26.820
Kids, yeah, kids.

01:52:26.820 --> 01:52:27.980
They need a ride

01:52:27.980 --> 01:52:30.140
that's just like F-Zero.

01:52:30.140 --> 01:52:35.140
I think that kids will grow up better if they had the same exposure to stuff that we had.

01:52:35.140 --> 01:52:37.660
They need tetherball.

01:52:37.660 --> 01:52:42.940
Children need tetherball so that if you get hit in the head enough times, duck, dodge

01:52:42.940 --> 01:52:43.940
the ball.

01:52:43.940 --> 01:52:48.860
Parents have to understand that there's a certain percentage of kids that will get raped

01:52:48.860 --> 01:52:50.660
and molested by people.

01:52:50.660 --> 01:52:54.400
Just accept the fact and hope that your kids aren't part of the statistic.

01:52:54.400 --> 01:52:56.780
You can't protect them from everything.

01:52:56.780 --> 01:52:59.140
You have to prepare them as best as you can.

01:52:59.140 --> 01:53:14.440
responsibility. They take away everything. All the stuff that we had when we were kids,

01:53:14.440 --> 01:53:22.020
that stuff was cool. I fell off of the freaking monkey bars before busted my lip open. I have

01:53:22.020 --> 01:53:30.500
have a scar right here, see? And I'm perfectly well adjusted. Oh, I cried. Ow. I was stupid

01:53:30.500 --> 01:53:35.900
and I never fell off of the monkey bars again. What's up with these pansy, like, playground

01:53:35.900 --> 01:53:40.260
equipment that they have now? It's all like powder. Plastic. Plastic. Whatever happened

01:53:40.260 --> 01:53:42.500
to the really cool wood stuff? They're going to get rid of the sand boxes next because

01:53:42.500 --> 01:53:49.700
children are going to eat sand. I ate my pies. Look at me. I'm normal. Hot. Well, relatively.

01:53:49.700 --> 01:53:55.620
I grew up mostly adjusted, you know, forget this.

01:53:55.620 --> 01:54:03.260
When I was back in Alabama, I went by my elementary school and I swear, all the metal things that

01:54:03.260 --> 01:54:08.180
I used to climb on, only a couple of them were there and they were rusted over so that

01:54:08.180 --> 01:54:11.060
nobody would want to touch them because they look nasty.

01:54:11.060 --> 01:54:15.820
It's not fun anymore, not fun to be a kid these days, especially with the Teletubbies

01:54:15.820 --> 01:54:20.020
teaching you that it's okay to go up to a perfect stranger and give them a hug.

01:54:20.020 --> 01:54:26.860
Yeah, yeah, yeah! I'm going to hug you! You're so retarded! You missed the whole thing we

01:54:26.860 --> 01:54:33.060
just did, so we're going to do it again! You know, the world is not like sunshine. You

01:54:33.060 --> 01:54:38.500
know, when I was little, you know, okay, you know what I was raised with when I was five?

01:54:38.500 --> 01:54:43.740
I freakin' had, well, what did I watch when I was little? I watched the Smurfs, and the

01:54:43.740 --> 01:54:47.420
The Smurfs taught you that there's fire, and it burns down the trees, and the world's not

01:54:47.420 --> 01:54:48.780
a happy singing place.

01:54:48.780 --> 01:54:50.260
And the Smurfs promote homosexuality.

01:54:50.260 --> 01:54:52.260
Yes, they do.

01:54:52.260 --> 01:54:55.500
Except when they got Smurfed, but I think that, you know...

01:54:55.500 --> 01:54:56.500
Smurfed.

01:54:56.500 --> 01:54:58.760
It was like a colony of ants.

01:54:58.760 --> 01:55:00.940
They all fucked the queen.

01:55:00.940 --> 01:55:02.500
And then, when I was...

01:55:02.500 --> 01:55:07.600
How old was I, 1983, 84?

01:55:07.600 --> 01:55:10.220
I was about seven.

01:55:10.220 --> 01:55:16.220
The best show ever came on TV, Transformers, at Transformers at G.I.

01:55:16.220 --> 01:55:17.220
Joe.

01:55:17.220 --> 01:55:21.300
You mean there's a different Transformers than the one with these little Transformers

01:55:21.300 --> 01:55:23.420
that they have to protect and it's like Pokemon?

01:55:23.420 --> 01:55:24.420
Okay, forget it.

01:55:24.420 --> 01:55:26.540
You know, I don't want that Armada crap.

01:55:26.540 --> 01:55:29.660
What about the ones where they turned into dinosaurs?

01:55:29.660 --> 01:55:30.660
I love that one.

01:55:30.660 --> 01:55:31.660
And apes and stuff.

01:55:31.660 --> 01:55:33.140
Hey, don't forget about Xenobots.

01:55:33.140 --> 01:55:34.540
Yeah, whatever.

01:55:34.540 --> 01:55:35.540
Okay.

01:55:35.540 --> 01:55:40.180
Okay, um, but you know, I had what Jason the real warriors we had Voltron

01:55:40.820 --> 01:55:44.320
We had what now what it what it what is there to watch on TV now?

01:55:45.780 --> 01:55:47.780
Pokemon Digimon

01:55:49.780 --> 01:55:51.780
Retarded okay

01:55:52.020 --> 01:55:58.200
Yu-gi-oh and did you want people die? Okay. Why are we teaching kids to play cards? It's not like

01:55:58.200 --> 01:55:59.200
What kind of thing?

01:55:59.200 --> 01:56:00.200
That's the way it is.

01:56:00.200 --> 01:56:01.200
That's the way it is.

01:56:01.200 --> 01:56:05.980
They're going to get a paper cut and get infected and die.

01:56:05.980 --> 01:56:06.980
Of course.

01:56:06.980 --> 01:56:07.980
And then cards will be banned.

01:56:07.980 --> 01:56:09.760
It was the same thing when we were kids.

01:56:09.760 --> 01:56:12.980
Every cartoon had its elaborate marking scheme that went with it.

01:56:12.980 --> 01:56:15.480
Everybody wanted the He-Man that you would punch it and the little thing would spin around

01:56:15.480 --> 01:56:16.480
and make it look like it was damaged.

01:56:16.480 --> 01:56:18.480
They don't have battle damaged toys anymore, do they?

01:56:18.480 --> 01:56:19.480
I know.

01:56:19.480 --> 01:56:20.480
That's so stupid.

01:56:20.480 --> 01:56:23.320
We had really cool things when we were young.

01:56:23.320 --> 01:56:24.320
I'll tell you what.

01:56:24.320 --> 01:56:25.320
I cry for today's children.

01:56:25.320 --> 01:56:28.000
You know what toy I play with more than anything, though?

01:56:28.000 --> 01:56:31.000
More than anything what toy I played with, Legos.

01:56:31.000 --> 01:56:34.160
I had Lincoln Logs and they were made out of wood and I got splinters in my fingers

01:56:34.160 --> 01:56:35.160
when I tried to break them.

01:56:35.160 --> 01:56:37.280
You tried to break the Lincoln Logs?

01:56:37.280 --> 01:56:39.160
I did because my house didn't look right.

01:56:39.160 --> 01:56:42.200
I'm surprised you didn't try to set them on fire or burn your house down.

01:56:42.200 --> 01:56:44.200
I did actually.

01:56:44.200 --> 01:56:49.400
And I had pick up sticks that were made out of metal.

01:56:49.400 --> 01:56:52.160
I built catapults of my Lincoln Logs.

01:56:52.160 --> 01:56:57.020
You put one of those small ones on a nice roof piece and you can hit it just really

01:56:57.020 --> 01:57:03.260
I would build parts of my houses with rubber bands so that I could make them collapsible

01:57:03.260 --> 01:57:07.500
so that they would kill my weeble men that I put inside of them.

01:57:07.500 --> 01:57:08.500
Comment from the chat room.

01:57:08.500 --> 01:57:12.060
This is how you know it's all coming to an end.

01:57:12.060 --> 01:57:13.060
Guess what?

01:57:13.060 --> 01:57:16.340
Riceprincess says she saw Transformers on MTV.

01:57:16.340 --> 01:57:17.860
Can I cry?

01:57:17.860 --> 01:57:18.860
You may have a sniff now.

01:57:18.860 --> 01:57:23.820
Unless it was the old ones, but if it was the new crappy ones then I'm going to cry.

01:57:23.820 --> 01:57:24.820
Yes.

01:57:24.820 --> 01:57:25.820
Now get 2DX's winner.

01:57:25.820 --> 01:57:26.820
Tinker Toys.

01:57:26.820 --> 01:57:38.740
I had the tinker toys that were life-size. They were the size of me. They kicked ass.

01:57:38.740 --> 01:57:45.540
You could build giant things that hurt people. They had building pieces like PVC pipes, so

01:57:45.540 --> 01:57:51.280
you could fight with the pieces and you could injure people. It was awesome. I had tons

01:57:51.280 --> 01:57:56.880
of those things oh my god just tons we had we had these things that were like

01:57:56.880 --> 01:58:01.880
plastic hard plastic sticks with foam on them and you could beat each other up

01:58:01.880 --> 01:58:04.920
with foam but if you took the foam off they were sticks and you could whack

01:58:04.920 --> 01:58:10.680
people in the head with them and like toys were lethal when we were young

01:58:10.680 --> 01:58:17.160
growing up with survival and look at us we're strong yeah because we're not dead

01:58:17.160 --> 01:58:20.520
from our toys I think pixie dust is saying in the chat room that the Smurfs

01:58:20.520 --> 01:58:24.520
Here's a reminder of the Anna Nicole show.

01:58:24.520 --> 01:58:28.520
Okay.

01:58:28.520 --> 01:58:31.520
Anyway, how about the winner of the cage match?

01:58:31.520 --> 01:58:32.520
Okay.

01:58:32.520 --> 01:58:34.520
The winner of tonight's Orange Lounge Cage Match.

01:58:34.520 --> 01:58:35.520
Are you closing?

01:58:35.520 --> 01:58:36.520
Yes, I'm closing.

01:58:36.520 --> 01:58:37.520
Eat your vegetables.

01:58:37.520 --> 01:58:39.520
Eat your vegetables.

01:58:39.520 --> 01:58:40.520
More spinach.

01:58:40.520 --> 01:58:42.520
You need iron.

01:58:42.520 --> 01:58:45.520
The winner of tonight's Orange Lounge Cage Match, I'm actually somewhat surprised by

01:58:45.520 --> 01:58:53.440
this, but the chat room did vote this one as the winner tonight. It is last week's winner,

01:58:53.440 --> 01:59:03.180
every little thing, face the change once again. Curse you, Loki, and your cursed trance music.

01:59:03.180 --> 01:59:12.840
Alright, so I think now's a good break time, huh? What do you say when we come back we

01:59:12.840 --> 01:59:17.520
let the Rio Rant team begin, eh? Sure. The FUs of the week when we come back. Also,

01:59:17.520 --> 01:59:21.080
before we get into the FUs of the week though, I want to talk about my gaming experience

01:59:21.080 --> 01:59:24.080
this week, because I've actually been playing more video games this week, so I'm going to

01:59:24.080 --> 01:59:25.080
Gasp!

01:59:25.080 --> 01:59:26.080
Gasp.

01:59:26.080 --> 01:59:28.080
So, we'll be back.

01:59:56.080 --> 02:00:12.360
Oh, one more time, I'm back with a new rhyme Hey, here we go again, turn it up my friend

02:00:12.360 --> 02:00:19.200
No, we don't stop, we rock the spot No, we don't quit, get ready or this is it

02:00:19.200 --> 02:00:20.200
Do you like the dream?

02:00:20.200 --> 02:00:21.200
Hey, I like the dream, baby Do you like the dream?

02:00:21.200 --> 02:00:22.200
Oh, I like the dream, mama Do you like the dream?

02:00:22.200 --> 02:00:25.480
Baby, do you like to dream? Oh, I like to dream

02:00:25.600 --> 02:00:28.800
Mama, do you like to scream? Hey, I like to scream

02:00:28.900 --> 02:00:32.120
Baby, do you like to scream? Oh, scream it out

02:00:32.640 --> 02:00:35.760
Scream a dream, Mother Tension Scream

02:00:35.900 --> 02:00:38.800
Take it every scene before you make me scream

02:00:39.440 --> 02:00:42.440
Scream a dream, nothing but nothing just a dream

02:00:42.540 --> 02:00:45.940
If you won't accept a dream or you're making me believe

02:00:46.220 --> 02:00:48.720
Ooh la-da-da, la-da-da

02:00:48.720 --> 02:00:52.720
You gotta dream a little dream

02:01:18.720 --> 02:01:21.720
Oh yeah

02:01:21.720 --> 02:01:28.720
You get it off the floor

02:01:28.720 --> 02:01:31.720
I need to love it

02:01:31.720 --> 02:01:38.720
You get it off the floor

02:01:38.720 --> 02:01:41.720
I need to love it

02:01:41.720 --> 02:01:47.720
You get it off the floor

02:01:47.720 --> 02:02:08.720
Get off the floor, I think I love it

02:02:17.720 --> 02:02:19.720
Oh yeah

02:02:23.720 --> 02:02:26.720
Going one, going two, going three, four

02:02:30.720 --> 02:02:33.720
Turn it down, turn it down, turn it down, yeah

02:02:35.720 --> 02:02:37.720
Yeah, yeah

02:02:37.720 --> 02:02:45.100
I'm gonna get away from you with another dimension

02:02:45.100 --> 02:02:52.240
I'm gonna get away from you with another dimension

02:02:52.240 --> 02:02:56.240
I'm gonna take you to another dimension, babe

02:03:52.240 --> 02:04:20.880
Hi, this is Melby of RTF, and for an extra $1.99 a minute, my girlfriend Melby can join

02:04:20.880 --> 02:04:25.560
us on all the fun together. Hey, hey, if you're a broke ass like I am, why don't you come

02:04:25.560 --> 02:04:29.960
to the one place that costs absolutely nothing to go to and still the fun is just as great.

02:04:29.960 --> 02:04:34.760
It's Orange Lounge Radio, Sunday nights. Kick it with me and you just might realize the

02:04:34.760 --> 02:04:47.280
best things in life are free. Hello, we're back. Uh, guess who's back? Hi. Yes, Shark's

02:04:47.280 --> 02:04:52.060
goes back hello so you're you're back finally we were starting to worry a

02:04:52.060 --> 02:04:55.420
little bit we're like well she's been gone a while least I was I was freaking

02:04:55.420 --> 02:05:00.700
lights just take forever although the funniest lowriding truck ever dude it

02:05:00.700 --> 02:05:05.420
looks like his ass was dragging on the ground and it had spinners oh god those

02:05:05.420 --> 02:05:09.900
are the most annoying things on the planet those things that spin I almost

02:05:09.900 --> 02:05:13.340
I took my ditch cam and took a picture of it, it was that bad, but he turned before

02:05:13.340 --> 02:05:17.420
I could do it.

02:05:17.420 --> 02:05:20.580
Spinners are horrible, and it's even worse on a lowriding truck that's dragging its ass

02:05:20.580 --> 02:05:21.580
on the ground.

02:05:21.580 --> 02:05:26.140
What did we see earlier?

02:05:26.140 --> 02:05:27.140
I don't remember.

02:05:27.140 --> 02:05:28.140
Tell them what we saw.

02:05:28.140 --> 02:05:30.980
We saw the Ultimate of Crap Lowriders, it was so ghetto.

02:05:30.980 --> 02:05:38.740
It was bad paint job, red and white, and it was just some crappy Chevy.

02:05:38.740 --> 02:05:43.340
The fearless sticker was the one in my house that was really crappy too.

02:05:43.340 --> 02:05:46.500
If your car looks like crap, make it look good before you put a sticker on it that has

02:05:46.500 --> 02:05:51.620
fearless on it.

02:05:51.620 --> 02:05:54.540
People just fear my car when I'm in it.

02:05:54.540 --> 02:06:00.940
My little Tercel can do some damage.

02:06:00.940 --> 02:06:03.820
I took a picture of my dream car though, one of my dream cars.

02:06:03.820 --> 02:06:07.940
There was a 350Z in the parking lot in the Dara, so I took a picture of it because I

02:06:07.940 --> 02:06:14.340
I want one. Madeira. Madeira. I had a fun time at the fair. That's a suburb of Fresno.

02:06:14.340 --> 02:06:20.100
I had a fun time at the fair though. You went to Fresno. I did not go to Fresno. I went

02:06:20.100 --> 02:06:25.260
to some place. You went to a place that's worse than Fresno. The Madeira district fair.

02:06:25.260 --> 02:06:31.580
I still have this vein of blue on my hand too. From where they stamped my hand. It looks

02:06:31.580 --> 02:06:34.380
That's like a bruise.

02:06:34.380 --> 02:06:39.380
Shall we get into the FUs of the week?

02:06:39.380 --> 02:06:41.380
Showa!

02:06:41.380 --> 02:06:52.380
This is the best part of the show.

02:06:52.380 --> 02:06:54.380
This is fucked up.

02:06:54.380 --> 02:06:56.380
Fuck being sick.

02:06:56.380 --> 02:07:01.580
good timing my lungs

02:07:01.580 --> 02:07:05.060
about being sick

02:07:05.060 --> 02:07:08.340
about trying to enjoy myself while being sick

02:07:08.340 --> 02:07:12.060
because I try and try and try but being sick sort of overshadows it

02:07:12.060 --> 02:07:15.220
I had a very good time at the concert so that was great but

02:07:15.220 --> 02:07:18.740
I just felt horrible

02:07:18.740 --> 02:07:22.820
and I've been sick since Tuesday and it got bad enough for me to go to the doctor on Thursday

02:07:22.820 --> 02:07:26.660
And I don't go to the doctor, so this is the first time I've actually been to a doctor

02:07:26.660 --> 02:07:28.780
on my own in seven years.

02:07:28.780 --> 02:07:38.540
Yes, I'm an angry girl, it's on my car, duh.

02:07:38.540 --> 02:07:44.660
Fuck stupid people and parents who don't know how to take responsibility for their children.

02:07:44.660 --> 02:07:51.780
And fuck things that suck and not having money.

02:07:51.780 --> 02:07:56.780
having money is a big suck of all. I could stand being sick if I had money because then

02:07:56.780 --> 02:08:03.780
I could go on the internet and shop. I can't even do that. I'm sick. So, yeah, that's not

02:08:03.780 --> 02:08:05.780
it. I'm being sick.

02:08:05.780 --> 02:08:09.780
Okay. Loki, I know you're cooking, but it's your turn.

02:08:09.780 --> 02:08:14.780
He's making that bacon crap.

02:08:14.780 --> 02:08:19.780
Oh, I don't believe that for a minute. Loki says he doesn't have anything. He's cooking.

02:08:19.780 --> 02:08:23.780
You're going to give up your chance to rant about something? Fuck cooking.

02:08:23.780 --> 02:08:24.780
Here.

02:08:29.780 --> 02:08:31.780
Yeah, F you too.

02:08:31.780 --> 02:08:33.780
Duh.

02:08:33.780 --> 02:08:34.780
Stupid people.

02:08:34.780 --> 02:08:38.780
You actually had a good week and nobody bothered you.

02:08:38.780 --> 02:08:39.780
That's amazing.

02:08:39.780 --> 02:08:40.780
Yeah, no.

02:08:40.780 --> 02:08:43.780
I didn't have a good week and people bothered me.

02:08:43.780 --> 02:08:45.780
But it's not really anything out of the usual.

02:08:45.780 --> 02:08:48.780
I see.

02:08:48.780 --> 02:08:51.280
Yes, because grief and fire don't hit.

02:08:51.280 --> 02:08:52.780
You're the one that I want?

02:08:52.780 --> 02:08:53.780
I wanna wanna...

02:08:53.780 --> 02:08:54.780
Boop, boop, boop.

02:08:54.780 --> 02:08:55.780
I'll be back.

02:08:55.780 --> 02:08:57.780
I'm sure I'll interject something later.

02:08:57.780 --> 02:08:59.280
Oh, hooray.

02:08:59.280 --> 02:09:00.280
My turn!

02:09:03.280 --> 02:09:05.280
My F.U. this week goes to Walmart.

02:09:05.280 --> 02:09:07.280
Because Walmart is evil.

02:09:07.280 --> 02:09:10.280
Walmart is the worst place on the face of the planet.

02:09:10.280 --> 02:09:11.280
I'll tell you why.

02:09:12.280 --> 02:09:12.780
Fine.

02:09:12.780 --> 02:09:14.280
All you're gonna find is V8 Splash.

02:09:16.280 --> 02:09:17.280
I love V8 Splash.

02:09:17.280 --> 02:09:23.280
I've never had that before, but I'm really trying to not do that.

02:09:23.280 --> 02:09:30.360
So V8, I have V8, Splash is mostly what I drink in iced tea and lemonade mixed.

02:09:30.360 --> 02:09:31.360
I like that too.

02:09:31.360 --> 02:09:35.600
V8 Splash is good, especially Diet V8 Splash because it's made with Splenda.

02:09:35.600 --> 02:09:36.600
It tastes like Propel.

02:09:36.600 --> 02:09:41.040
Anyway, my end of the week goes to Walmart because they suck.

02:09:41.040 --> 02:09:45.420
I went to Walmart on Saturday night with Lanky Style because I wanted a new F-Zero game for

02:09:45.420 --> 02:09:49.060
GameCube. And I was all excited because the new F-Zero game for GameCube was supposed

02:09:49.060 --> 02:09:54.180
to kick ass. And I had a $10 off at Wal-Mart card because my work gives out gift cards

02:09:54.180 --> 02:09:57.780
as incentives. So when we do something really good, we get a gift card. So I had a $10 gift

02:09:57.780 --> 02:10:04.380
card to Wal-Mart because they asked people at work, what places would you like a gift

02:10:04.380 --> 02:10:10.380
card to? And people were like, Wal-Mart. So anyway, I decided I'm going to go to Wal-Mart

02:10:40.380 --> 02:10:43.660
stacking movies and she saw me and she came over and she said can I help you type thing

02:10:43.660 --> 02:10:47.280
and I said yeah I wanted to get that game and she's like oh I don't have the key let

02:10:47.280 --> 02:10:50.420
me get somebody who can get the key I'm like they don't have the key behind the counter

02:10:50.420 --> 02:10:57.020
fine get the manager get the key so they get one of those people after ten minutes at least

02:10:57.020 --> 02:11:05.140
ten minutes they get oops sorry my music ran out here after at least ten minutes finally

02:11:05.140 --> 02:11:09.660
one of those folks in the red vests who I guess are like you know super Walmart stars

02:11:09.660 --> 02:11:12.260
or whatever they are, managers, decision managers, whatever they are. They're the Red Vest people.

02:11:12.260 --> 02:11:16.320
At Walmart you have the Blue Vest people who are the normal drones and the Red Vest people

02:11:16.320 --> 02:11:23.320
who command the blue drones, right? So a Red Vest came by and he had the wrong key. He

02:11:23.440 --> 02:11:27.220
tried to open it up and he had the wrong key. And the woman who was there was like, no,

02:11:27.220 --> 02:11:31.300
no, no, you need the blue and green one, not the blue one. Apparently everything's color

02:11:31.300 --> 02:11:38.300
coded at Walmart. So he leaves and ten minutes later, after waiting another ten minutes,

02:11:38.300 --> 02:11:45.300
he comes back and says, I can't find it. So finally the lady says, I'm so sorry. I will

02:11:45.300 --> 02:11:49.420
go to, I know where the key is. I'll go get it. So she goes off. Ten minutes later, she

02:11:49.420 --> 02:11:55.420
comes back. Sir, I'm so sorry. After a half hour now of waiting. Sir, I'm so sorry. The

02:11:55.420 --> 02:11:59.900
key isn't where it's supposed to be. What the fuck do you mean the key is not where

02:11:59.900 --> 02:12:03.420
it's supposed to be? Who opened the case? No one opened the case between the time I

02:12:03.420 --> 02:12:07.780
was there and when she was there. Where was the manager? Where was anybody running the

02:12:07.780 --> 02:12:11.160
electronics department. Why aren't things that are supposed to be? Why isn't the key

02:12:11.160 --> 02:12:15.000
behind the counter? Why doesn't the red vest guy carry the key? Why doesn't he know what

02:12:15.000 --> 02:12:20.000
the hell color key goes with what? Doesn't he know how to run his own fucking store?

02:12:20.000 --> 02:12:27.000
Fuck. I was about to say, go to the hardware department and get me a hammer. I'll fix this.

02:12:27.200 --> 02:12:34.200
Seriously. So. God. So I didn't get my game. I'm pissed. I leave Walmart and I don't get

02:12:34.200 --> 02:12:37.160
I leave Walmart, and I don't get anything.

02:12:37.160 --> 02:12:39.360
So I went the next day to Target.

02:12:39.360 --> 02:12:40.680
I purposely went to Target.

02:12:40.680 --> 02:12:42.280
I could have gone to GameSpot, where I usually get games.

02:12:42.280 --> 02:12:44.720
No, I went to Target, because I purposely went to buy it for

02:12:44.720 --> 02:12:45.720
the competition.

02:12:45.720 --> 02:12:48.280
So I went in, and within two minutes, there was a guy

02:12:48.280 --> 02:12:49.200
behind the desk.

02:12:49.200 --> 02:12:51.240
He opened the case up, got out my game, rang it up right

02:12:51.240 --> 02:12:53.240
there, I was in and out of Target in three minutes.

02:12:56.080 --> 02:12:59.160
Walmart can suck balls.

02:12:59.160 --> 02:13:00.020
I'm done.

02:13:00.020 --> 02:13:01.960
Your turn, Melody.

02:13:01.960 --> 02:13:04.000
Wow, are you sure you want to do this?

02:13:04.000 --> 02:13:05.000
Yes.

02:13:05.000 --> 02:13:06.000
Fuck traffic.

02:13:06.000 --> 02:13:07.000
Fuck red lights.

02:13:07.000 --> 02:13:11.440
Fuck the cell phone reception in this damn area because it keeps dropping my phone.

02:13:11.440 --> 02:13:15.600
And fuck the fucking truck that's parked in Jamie's parking lot because I freaking hit

02:13:15.600 --> 02:13:19.360
it.

02:13:19.360 --> 02:13:21.040
And Jamie says she's almost hit it a bunch of times.

02:13:21.040 --> 02:13:25.360
And the funny thing is, you couldn't fucking tell that I hit the damn car.

02:13:25.360 --> 02:13:29.120
It's like so beat up and crappy, you can't even tell.

02:13:29.120 --> 02:13:31.740
Oh, Jamie wants to elaborate.

02:13:31.740 --> 02:13:34.500
Park everybody who parks along that fence.

02:13:34.500 --> 02:13:36.500
Cam Lao to hell.

02:13:36.500 --> 02:13:41.020
Yeah, it's parking spots and then people parallel park right behind you so it's like a freaking

02:13:41.020 --> 02:13:42.020
obstacle course.

02:13:42.020 --> 02:13:46.140
And I had a car trying to come in that was trying to hurry me up but apparently I just

02:13:46.140 --> 02:13:47.140
went a little too far.

02:13:47.140 --> 02:13:49.340
And I couldn't see the truck because it was right directly behind me.

02:13:49.340 --> 02:13:52.940
I was looking over my shoulder but you couldn't tell and I was like oh fuck.

02:13:52.940 --> 02:14:00.300
So yeah fuck that and fuck having to drive home now because I was stupid and forgot something.

02:14:00.300 --> 02:14:07.300
So fuck having to drive home and fucking me to work tomorrow because I really don't want

02:14:07.300 --> 02:14:08.300
to.

02:14:08.300 --> 02:14:14.620
Fuck money and fuck everything that's in your fucking and that's it.

02:14:14.620 --> 02:14:17.460
I'm angry tonight.

02:14:17.460 --> 02:14:19.460
Shall we hear from our chat room?

02:14:19.460 --> 02:14:22.140
Alright, here they go.

02:14:22.140 --> 02:14:23.140
Chat room FUs.

02:14:23.140 --> 02:14:29.540
Dr. Tetsuya says, F you to missing most of the show and F you to morons at the theater.

02:14:29.540 --> 02:14:34.700
If you're going to make cracks about the movie, that's what watching it at home is for.

02:14:34.700 --> 02:14:36.580
And F you not having Soul Calibur 2.

02:14:36.580 --> 02:14:39.580
Wait, I have to add something though there with the movie.

02:14:39.580 --> 02:14:40.580
Yeah, Sharks Girl.

02:14:40.580 --> 02:14:42.340
Sometimes that's better than the movie itself.

02:14:42.340 --> 02:14:43.340
I definitely agree.

02:14:43.340 --> 02:14:48.580
It really depends on the movie you're seeing because when we went and saw Pokemon, yelling

02:14:48.580 --> 02:14:51.380
back at the screen made it ten times better.

02:14:51.380 --> 02:14:53.300
Spice World, case point.

02:14:53.300 --> 02:14:54.300
Thank you.

02:14:54.300 --> 02:14:58.940
I saw Spice World opening day two.

02:14:58.940 --> 02:15:00.940
High five!

02:15:00.940 --> 02:15:02.940
I saw Spice World for free.

02:15:02.940 --> 02:15:04.940
I didn't have to pay for it.

02:15:04.940 --> 02:15:07.940
We were going to dress as Spice Girls and everything, but we didn't have time.

02:15:07.940 --> 02:15:10.940
It was us and all these junior high girls.

02:15:10.940 --> 02:15:12.940
Yeah, we were the only people in the theater.

02:15:12.940 --> 02:15:14.940
My friend and I were the only people in the theater without a kid.

02:15:14.940 --> 02:15:16.940
It was kind of scary, actually.

02:15:16.940 --> 02:15:19.940
I had so much fun at Spice World.

02:15:19.940 --> 02:15:21.940
Oh, I have the tape.

02:15:21.940 --> 02:15:24.940
I have a promo poster. I have a promo poster I won.

02:15:24.940 --> 02:15:25.940
Anyway.

02:15:25.940 --> 02:15:27.940
Back to the inks, please.

02:15:27.940 --> 02:15:29.940
But the supplies are all fine.

02:15:29.940 --> 02:15:32.940
23rd Magus. He's pretty angsty.

02:15:32.940 --> 02:15:37.940
F you to Angel's work schedule. This makes a whole month she's missed Orange Lounge. I cry.

02:15:37.940 --> 02:15:42.940
A big fuck you to controlling parents who use the because it's my house argument.

02:15:42.940 --> 02:15:44.940
This is their house?

02:15:44.940 --> 02:15:47.940
Now I'm not allowed to leave my bedroom after 1 a.m.

02:15:47.940 --> 02:15:49.940
Okay, you can live in the dorms.

02:15:49.940 --> 02:15:50.940
What the fuck?

02:15:50.940 --> 02:15:51.940
You can take out a student loan to live in the dorms.

02:15:51.940 --> 02:15:56.940
F you to the CIS department dean at ARC for dropping me for my PC repair class.

02:15:56.940 --> 02:16:01.940
Bitch die.

02:16:01.940 --> 02:16:06.940
John Fields would like to say F you to Adobe Premiere freezing up a lot.

02:16:06.940 --> 02:16:09.940
F you to one of my hard disks dying.

02:16:09.940 --> 02:16:18.940
F you to classes that require outside class activity beyond homework.

02:16:18.940 --> 02:16:25.940
EvilMaoki2Dx says, F you for me not being able to ogle the sweet lancer evolution 4

02:16:26.020 --> 02:16:31.020
I saw in Japan Town today. And F you to my parents for changing plans for Benihana at

02:16:31.020 --> 02:16:38.020
the last minute. F you to not being able to call uni when I want. Aww.

02:16:38.860 --> 02:16:42.600
Nince would like to say F you to various things in my apartment like the crappy shower head

02:16:42.600 --> 02:16:48.660
and the mailbox key that doesn't work. F you to class starting up again. F you to the physics

02:16:48.660 --> 02:16:53.300
department at my college physics department for not letting me register yet. F you to

02:16:53.300 --> 02:16:55.140
furniture in a box.

02:16:55.140 --> 02:16:59.640
I can't have all these extra pieces.

02:16:59.640 --> 02:17:04.340
Yes, IKEA is the exception. You may not have IKEA where you live, Ninst, but IKEA is the

02:17:04.340 --> 02:17:06.540
exception. IKEA is godly.

02:17:06.540 --> 02:17:11.660
IKEA is five minutes from where I work. I didn't even go.

02:17:11.660 --> 02:17:15.840
I want to go. That's why I need to come visit, because I have to go to IKEA.

02:17:15.840 --> 02:17:18.340
It's five minutes from where I work. I kid you not.

02:17:18.340 --> 02:17:20.420
It's great. I have to go there myself.

02:17:20.420 --> 02:17:23.740
But this is the new one, right? Not the one that's closer to me, actually.

02:17:23.740 --> 02:17:27.340
If I wanted to go to the close IKEA, I'd just go to the one in the Berlin game.

02:17:27.340 --> 02:17:31.780
Emeryville. No, the new one's in East Palo Alto. And I work in, like, Palo Alto.

02:17:31.780 --> 02:17:34.660
I have a friend that's moving to Palo Alto this week.

02:17:34.660 --> 02:17:37.700
Oh, wow. Cool. He's cute. You should be his friend.

02:17:37.700 --> 02:17:39.100
Put him on Fredster.

02:17:39.100 --> 02:17:43.700
Put him on Fredster.

02:17:43.700 --> 02:17:45.020
Okay.

02:17:45.020 --> 02:17:49.120
If you did the idiot who hit my neighbor's car, they hit the end trying to pull into

02:17:49.120 --> 02:17:50.120
a spot.

02:17:50.120 --> 02:17:52.640
Yeah, it was Sharks Girl.

02:17:52.640 --> 02:17:55.040
And my neighbor and myself watched as this happened.

02:17:55.040 --> 02:17:59.380
The guys just, well those guys, the guys just looked right at us, pulled out and tried to

02:17:59.380 --> 02:18:05.340
hide further down in the parking lot.

02:18:05.340 --> 02:18:09.380
John Fields would like to clarify, or give another F.U., F.U. to websites that force

02:18:09.380 --> 02:18:11.780
you to say yes to their install programs.

02:18:11.780 --> 02:18:15.260
I'm sick of hitting the power button on my computer because of them.

02:18:15.260 --> 02:18:17.620
Mozilla is your friend.

02:18:17.620 --> 02:18:18.620
Just click no.

02:18:18.620 --> 02:18:22.460
Yeah, stop going to porns and wear sites because those are the only sites I know of that force

02:18:22.460 --> 02:18:23.460
you to click yes.

02:18:23.460 --> 02:18:24.460
No.

02:18:24.460 --> 02:18:30.460
Well, all you have to do is just use the Google toolbar.

02:18:30.460 --> 02:18:37.740
Lastly, Pixie Dust says, well, first off, a big F you to myself for getting a new tattoo.

02:18:37.740 --> 02:18:40.020
It is scabby and hurts me.

02:18:40.020 --> 02:18:46.260
So yeah, I'm not too comfy right now.

02:18:46.260 --> 02:18:50.580
The ugly mofo I went out with for a month in April, f you for ruining my birthday pics

02:18:50.580 --> 02:18:51.580
with your face.

02:18:51.580 --> 02:18:52.580
You remember him, Skye?

02:18:52.580 --> 02:18:53.580
Yes, I do.

02:18:53.580 --> 02:18:56.380
And another f you goes to people who have been moody and bitchy around me.

02:18:56.380 --> 02:19:02.340
Get off your poopy ass toilet and get happy.

02:19:02.340 --> 02:19:04.100
That is the best thing ever.

02:19:04.100 --> 02:19:06.740
Get off your poopy ass toilet.

02:19:06.740 --> 02:19:08.740
Come on, get happy.

02:19:08.740 --> 02:19:21.740
I nominate Dark Tetsuya to run that task because he always posts in the community.

02:19:38.740 --> 02:19:41.740
Anyway, along with pixie dust fus by the way

02:19:41.740 --> 02:19:46.840
I found the camera for my birthday dinner and that brings up all the bitchiness towards that asshole in the way

02:19:46.840 --> 02:19:49.540
He dubbed me. He was you can do so much better than that, you know

02:19:50.180 --> 02:19:52.920
F you to sky for not liking Walmart screw you too, bitch

02:19:53.060 --> 02:19:58.260
It is ghetto, but hell I got a new razor with free refills for only five bucks. Lol

02:19:58.260 --> 02:20:05.340
I'll get over the Walmart thing, but that made me mad. I'll get over it. I'll shop at Walmart again, but

02:20:35.340 --> 02:20:43.340
LOKI wants to go now because they thought of something, and now he has bacon in his system, so can we get a mic over to LOKI?

02:20:43.340 --> 02:20:45.340
Causing his angst level to rise.

02:20:45.340 --> 02:20:49.340
That's it, they're done. That was the last one.

02:20:49.340 --> 02:20:57.340
Have you the, um, stupid news reporters covering the Disneyland tragedy? Or, uh, comedy, I guess?

02:20:57.340 --> 02:21:01.340
Um, you couldn't even get close enough to see mangled people, you suck.

02:21:01.340 --> 02:21:07.340
I mean, if you're going to fly around in a helicopter, at least zoom down there, what are they going to do, shoot rockets at you? Come on.

02:21:07.340 --> 02:21:10.340
I mean, nothing's stopping you.

02:21:10.340 --> 02:21:15.340
F you to Gray Davis, because you suck.

02:21:15.340 --> 02:21:22.340
And just because you think, you know, immigrants should now not drive, well, good for you.

02:21:22.340 --> 02:21:29.340
Hello, hello, hello, news alert, that's an assembly bill, it's not just Gray Davis.

02:21:29.340 --> 02:21:36.340
The only thing that bothers me about the recall is that I think they should recall the entire fucking assembly because Gray Davis gets blamed for all these bills.

02:21:36.340 --> 02:21:41.340
Sure, he signs them when he can veto them, but he's not the sole bearer of all this stuff.

02:21:41.340 --> 02:21:44.340
What do we do? He signs a bill. I sign a check. What's your point?

02:21:44.340 --> 02:21:57.340
Anyways, after you're Gray Davis because you like illegal immigrants in the country because you do dirty work, I think we should kick you out of the country because you suck.

02:22:27.340 --> 02:22:44.740
No. I'm done. All right. FUs of the week are done.com. Hooray. So I have something else

02:22:44.740 --> 02:22:47.940
somewhere but my... Oh, Jamie has something to say?

02:22:47.940 --> 02:22:53.940
I want pancakes right now. Oh, God. I wish it was like a IHOP near here.

02:22:53.940 --> 02:22:55.020
I want...

02:22:55.020 --> 02:22:56.560
Yeah, but it's closed.

02:22:56.560 --> 02:22:57.880
Isn't it?

02:22:57.880 --> 02:22:58.540
I think so.

02:22:58.540 --> 02:23:00.020
I want pumpkin pancakes.

02:23:00.020 --> 02:23:02.480
Besides, you had a happy yesterday. You don't want to get in today.

02:23:02.480 --> 02:23:04.340
I want some pancakes. And we have Mongolian.

02:23:04.340 --> 02:23:08.340
That means, you know, Mongolian means you go poop a lot.

02:23:08.340 --> 02:23:10.900
You know what? I found a way to not

02:23:10.900 --> 02:23:13.940
have a diarrhea bomb after Mongolian today.

02:23:13.940 --> 02:23:14.860
What?

02:23:14.860 --> 02:23:17.220
I didn't put any oil in it.

02:23:17.220 --> 02:23:20.700
I only put about half the noodles I usually do. I put no oil in it. I put

02:23:20.700 --> 02:23:23.360
nothing but teriyaki sauce and sweet and sour sauce.

02:23:23.360 --> 02:23:25.360
I'm going to show you something.

02:23:25.360 --> 02:23:27.360
Do you see this bottle?

02:23:27.360 --> 02:23:29.360
I'm going to hold it up.

02:23:29.360 --> 02:23:32.360
I've got to cover my name because we have our names.

02:23:32.360 --> 02:23:34.360
Oh, we're going to put it on the webcam.

02:23:34.360 --> 02:23:36.360
I am too.

02:23:36.360 --> 02:23:38.360
Oh, good, my name's not on here.

02:23:38.360 --> 02:23:39.360
All right.

02:23:39.360 --> 02:23:42.360
OK.

02:23:42.360 --> 02:23:45.360
I'll let you know how long you have to hold it there.

02:23:45.360 --> 02:23:47.360
Oh, it took a ghost picture.

02:23:47.360 --> 02:23:49.360
You've got 50 seconds before it goes again.

02:23:49.360 --> 02:23:51.360
OK, so while we're waiting.

02:23:51.360 --> 02:23:56.360
Look at that ghosty thing. That's erythromycin. It makes you poop.

02:23:56.360 --> 02:23:59.360
Never eat Mongolian barbecue when you're on antibiotics.

02:23:59.360 --> 02:24:01.360
Thank you.

02:24:01.360 --> 02:24:06.360
Actually, the one thing that works better than this for going to the bathroom is sugar-free Hershey's dark chocolate.

02:24:06.360 --> 02:24:10.360
But today's Mongolian? I just want to say today's Mongolian only made me fart a lot.

02:24:10.360 --> 02:24:15.360
It did not make me go to the bathroom and just unload.

02:24:15.360 --> 02:24:17.360
746 cleanser.

02:24:17.360 --> 02:24:19.360
It's an all-purpose cleaner, and then they use it at roundtables.

02:24:19.360 --> 02:24:22.360
You put it on pizza, it makes you shit out everything inside.

02:24:22.360 --> 02:24:25.360
Loki, can you say that on the microphone, please?

02:24:28.360 --> 02:24:32.360
Something that'll make you crap more is 746 all-purpose cleanser.

02:24:32.360 --> 02:24:35.360
It's what they use to clean all the countertops and stuff at roundtable.

02:24:35.360 --> 02:24:39.360
If they put that on your pizza and you eat it, it'll make you shit out.

02:24:39.360 --> 02:24:44.480
shit out. I mean, someone did that to me once, and I never knew that that much crap could

02:24:44.480 --> 02:24:59.120
be in my body. I think I shit for a complete hour, just non-stop shitting. It's like going

02:24:59.120 --> 02:25:03.360
on a diet. It's like that stuff... No, I wonder if that's all that... You know that Hollywood

02:25:03.360 --> 02:25:09.720
diet, the colon cleanser, the Hollywood diet that you can buy at Walgreens and you basically

02:25:09.720 --> 02:25:12.920
mix it with water and you're supposed to take it on a weekend because you don't want to

02:25:12.920 --> 02:25:16.320
take this at work because you're going to spend your weekend vacationing on the throne,

02:25:16.320 --> 02:25:22.320
vacationing on the porcelain throne. Bring a Game Boy and a bathroom reader because it's

02:25:22.320 --> 02:25:23.320
going to be a long weekend.

02:25:23.320 --> 02:25:30.100
That's the only place that the British Excel is in toilet technology. They have some really

02:25:30.100 --> 02:25:31.100
kick-ass toilets.

02:25:31.100 --> 02:25:35.100
Dude, why isn't the bidet huge here? That's what I want to know.

02:25:35.100 --> 02:25:38.100
Bidets are the shit. No pun intended.

02:25:38.100 --> 02:25:40.100
I would love to have a bidet. That would kick ass.

02:25:40.100 --> 02:25:42.100
I would... bidets...

02:25:42.100 --> 02:25:44.100
Japanese super toilet. Oh yeah.

02:25:44.100 --> 02:25:46.100
A Japanese super...

02:25:46.100 --> 02:25:49.100
Man. I want a bidet.

02:25:49.100 --> 02:25:52.100
Let's talk to our landlord and see if we can get a bidet in here.

02:25:52.100 --> 02:26:03.980
I think now is a good time to take a break.

02:26:03.980 --> 02:26:05.860
Can we just take a break?

02:26:05.860 --> 02:26:06.860
We did the FUs of the week.

02:26:06.860 --> 02:26:08.140
Oh yeah, it must have been caught.

02:26:08.140 --> 02:26:10.500
It just feels like a break.

02:26:10.500 --> 02:26:14.780
This break I'm going to play.59 again, but I'm going to play a special remix of it, because

02:26:14.780 --> 02:26:16.800
a lot of people have been requesting this in chat rooms.

02:26:16.800 --> 02:26:21.860
So this is a really good remix of.59 too, so to celebrate episode 59, which is what

02:26:21.860 --> 02:26:24.940
So we're in right now, here's 0.59, the piano version,

02:26:24.940 --> 02:26:26.580
a Naoki remix.

02:26:26.580 --> 02:26:28.540
Enjoy.

02:27:58.540 --> 02:28:03.540
...

02:28:03.540 --> 02:28:08.540
...

02:28:08.540 --> 02:28:13.540
...

02:28:13.540 --> 02:28:18.540
...

02:28:18.540 --> 02:28:23.540
...

02:29:23.540 --> 02:29:51.580
And I hate it off another level And I hate it off another level

02:29:51.580 --> 02:30:02.580
Why did our feelings die in action, when we fought for satisfaction?

02:30:02.580 --> 02:30:07.580
But our hearts and S.O.S. saved me

02:30:07.580 --> 02:30:12.580
Why did our love cause all this magic?

02:30:12.580 --> 02:30:16.580
Just a new kind of tragedy

02:30:16.580 --> 02:30:21.580
We were here for the best

02:30:21.580 --> 02:30:24.580
In the heat of the night

02:30:24.580 --> 02:30:28.580
Once you close to the fire

02:30:28.580 --> 02:30:31.580
And the power of our hearts

02:30:31.580 --> 02:30:35.580
Makes me drive inside

02:30:35.580 --> 02:30:38.580
In the heat of the night

02:30:38.580 --> 02:30:42.580
Once you close to the fire

02:30:42.580 --> 02:30:45.580
And the power of our hearts

02:30:45.580 --> 02:31:14.780
Let's listen in on an Orange Lounge radio staff meeting.

02:31:14.780 --> 02:31:16.780
Do we want to be accepted by Hollywood?

02:31:16.780 --> 02:31:18.780
No!

02:31:18.780 --> 02:31:20.780
Do we care what people think of us?

02:31:20.780 --> 02:31:22.780
No!

02:31:22.780 --> 02:31:24.780
Do we want people to kiss our ass?

02:31:24.780 --> 02:31:26.780
Yes!

02:31:28.780 --> 02:31:34.780
Extreme Babati Radio. That's us. Orange Lounge Radio.

02:31:36.780 --> 02:31:39.780
Sharks Girl is waving goodbye to all of you on the camera right now.

02:31:39.780 --> 02:31:41.780
And then Loki is putting up some bacon.

02:31:41.780 --> 02:31:45.460
Any final thoughts from you since you're leaving?

02:31:45.460 --> 02:31:48.340
Ummm...

02:31:48.340 --> 02:31:50.460
Tip your waiter.

02:31:50.460 --> 02:31:53.380
Very nice. Have a safe drive.

02:31:53.380 --> 02:31:58.180
Thank you for coming. Tell everyone in the bay we said hello.

02:31:58.180 --> 02:32:01.860
I'm stealing another piece of bacon. That's another F-you to rob for stealing

02:32:01.860 --> 02:32:04.100
Loki's bacon.

02:32:04.100 --> 02:32:07.180
We were just talking during the break about how our bathroom has no door.

02:32:07.180 --> 02:32:11.660
Oh my god, I walk into the bathroom. That's how we make our money. I'm like, where the hell is the door?

02:32:11.660 --> 02:32:14.940
I don't see a door here. Do you not have a door on your bathroom?

02:32:14.940 --> 02:32:18.780
Here in the Orange Lounge apartment, we have a sliding door. That's the trick.

02:32:18.780 --> 02:32:23.500
It's really weird if you don't notice it, though, because you're just like, there's no door to the bathroom.

02:32:23.500 --> 02:32:28.940
Jamie's playing with the webcam, so you might see some interesting things on the cam for the next little bit.

02:32:28.940 --> 02:32:35.620
If you don't know our cam's address, go to our chat room, www.calibomani.com, click on Orange Lounge, and click on chat.

02:32:35.620 --> 02:32:38.620
Okay. Yes, visit the forums while you're there.

02:32:38.620 --> 02:32:41.140
sharks girl has left the building

02:32:41.140 --> 02:32:43.300
by sharks girl

02:32:43.300 --> 02:32:44.700
be all good all

02:32:44.700 --> 02:32:46.580
alright we're good enough

02:32:46.580 --> 02:32:48.100
tell mel we said hi to

02:32:48.100 --> 02:32:49.420
too bad he couldn't be here yeah

02:32:49.420 --> 02:32:51.580
he was stuck working

02:32:51.580 --> 02:32:54.500
he could have gone to weird Al and he instead he worked

02:32:54.500 --> 02:32:56.900
he got to test what what was he testing today

02:32:56.900 --> 02:32:58.500
good lord he was testing yugioh

02:32:58.500 --> 02:33:00.380
yugioh

02:33:00.380 --> 02:33:04.260
oh my god weird Al got passed on to play yugioh

02:33:04.260 --> 02:33:07.260
You can even get me started, I'll be here like until next week.

02:33:07.260 --> 02:33:08.260
Alright, alright.

02:33:08.260 --> 02:33:09.260
Have a safe drive.

02:33:09.260 --> 02:33:10.260
Bye.

02:33:10.260 --> 02:33:11.260
Yeah, I know.

02:33:11.260 --> 02:33:12.260
Get her started.

02:33:12.260 --> 02:33:13.260
Enjoy Boba.

02:33:13.260 --> 02:33:14.260
Bye.

02:33:14.260 --> 02:33:15.260
Bye.

02:33:15.260 --> 02:33:16.260
Anyway.

02:33:16.260 --> 02:33:23.260
So, um, I was at Virgin Megastore this week.

02:33:23.260 --> 02:33:26.260
No, I'm not a virgin.

02:33:26.260 --> 02:33:27.260
Sharkstar?

02:33:27.260 --> 02:33:28.260
No, I'm kidding.

02:33:28.260 --> 02:33:29.260
I love you.

02:33:29.260 --> 02:33:30.260
Bye.

02:33:30.260 --> 02:33:33.260
Um, I went to a Virgin Megastore this week and I was doing some shopping and I picked

02:33:33.260 --> 02:33:38.580
I picked this up. This is pretty cool. I picked up the single for Drifting Away. Lang featuring

02:33:38.580 --> 02:33:41.680
Skywood drifting away the single. Here, I'll put this up on Cam. Well, I can't put up on

02:33:41.680 --> 02:33:46.720
Cam for another 50 seconds when it refreshes, but it's an interesting little background

02:33:46.720 --> 02:33:51.360
picture, just a little sunset. It has four tracks. It has the radio edit, which you probably

02:33:51.360 --> 02:33:56.080
are all familiar with, the original 12-inch mix, a Beam versus Cyrus remix, which sucks

02:33:56.080 --> 02:34:00.760
balls, and the Lang sunset dub, which is okay. But I saw that it was kind of neat to walk

02:34:00.760 --> 02:34:05.860
talking to the store and it was like, ooh, a Bimani single, because I didn't think this

02:34:05.860 --> 02:34:09.560
song had actually been released in the U.S. So that was kind of a pleasant surprise.

02:34:09.560 --> 02:34:13.560
Are you sure that's not an import? I don't think so. It didn't have the little

02:34:13.560 --> 02:34:17.680
import sticker on it. And you know what's cool is it's put out by Radical Records who

02:34:17.680 --> 02:34:22.360
did that time after time CD, if I remember right. Yes? I'm not sure. Anyway, I'll put

02:34:22.360 --> 02:34:26.540
this up on the cams, I guess, and see what this CD looks like. So I picked it up. I don't

02:34:26.540 --> 02:34:37.940
believe this is an import, but who knows. I think I got it blurry. Oh well, forget it.

02:34:37.940 --> 02:34:38.940
I can't hold my hands still.

02:34:38.940 --> 02:34:39.940
That's the deal.

02:34:39.940 --> 02:34:45.400
Yeah, deal with it. So that's on the cam if you want to see what that looks like. It's

02:34:45.400 --> 02:34:46.400
902.

02:34:46.400 --> 02:34:47.400
Wow.

02:34:47.400 --> 02:34:50.500
I know, we're cruising through the show here. Is there anything you wanted to bring up?

02:34:50.500 --> 02:34:51.500
No.

02:34:51.500 --> 02:34:54.160
Yeah, I guess we could do Ask Orange Lounge.

02:34:54.160 --> 02:34:55.160
You can see it clearly.

02:34:55.160 --> 02:34:58.160
Yeah, you can see it clearly enough on the cam.

02:34:58.160 --> 02:35:00.160
If you want to ask Orange Lounge a question...

02:35:00.160 --> 02:35:02.160
Actually, I want to bring up something.

02:35:02.160 --> 02:35:07.160
Okay, well, before you bring that up, bring it up.

02:35:07.160 --> 02:35:09.160
Send in your questions in the chat room.

02:35:09.160 --> 02:35:11.160
Send a private message to Sky for Ask Orange Lounge,

02:35:11.160 --> 02:35:14.160
and we'll get to that right after Jamie brings up.

02:35:14.160 --> 02:35:15.160
My plug.

02:35:15.160 --> 02:35:16.160
Okay.

02:35:16.160 --> 02:35:20.160
Well, besides, you know, of course, my lovely, beautiful Tuesday night show,

02:35:20.160 --> 02:35:23.160
which we haven't talked about our shows,

02:35:23.160 --> 02:35:29.000
I would like to bring up that I have a new forum for people who are into gaming of all

02:35:29.000 --> 02:35:30.000
kinds.

02:35:30.000 --> 02:35:31.000
It's at roleplay.darksakura.com.

02:35:31.000 --> 02:35:32.000
Sign up.

02:35:32.000 --> 02:35:39.800
I run, basically, there's going to be free form games from there.

02:35:39.800 --> 02:35:45.520
If you want to run a game using the message board system, send me a private message and

02:35:45.520 --> 02:35:46.520
I'll get your game set up.

02:35:46.520 --> 02:35:51.920
Get you set up as moderator for your forum, for your group, and we'll get you set up.

02:35:51.920 --> 02:35:55.280
You know we have different game discussions different types of games

02:35:55.280 --> 02:36:00.080
So if you there's a game that you want to have an open discussion on let me know just sign up for your account

02:36:00.080 --> 02:36:02.080
And we'll set you up

02:36:02.120 --> 02:36:04.120
It's that easy

02:36:08.040 --> 02:36:12.560
Also since you brought up Tuesday show let's give a plug for all our spin-off shows on the

02:36:14.480 --> 02:36:18.620
Okay Tuesday, I'll start with any I should start with Monday. Yes

02:36:18.620 --> 02:36:20.620
Yeah, you still want to go first.

02:36:20.620 --> 02:36:21.620
Yeah, I know.

02:36:21.620 --> 02:36:26.980
Monday nights is Vanilla Sky, and originally I was going to have a rotating panel, I was

02:36:26.980 --> 02:36:30.340
going to have different people in here every week, but Brad and Irene have worked out so

02:36:30.340 --> 02:36:34.660
well that they're just here, pretty much the perma-co-hosts on Vanilla Sky, where we talk

02:36:34.660 --> 02:36:41.220
about everything kind of like, we talk about other game stuff, and then we talk about things

02:36:41.220 --> 02:36:42.220
outside of that.

02:36:42.220 --> 02:36:45.140
We talk about what's going on in the real world, also outside your computer, from a

02:36:45.140 --> 02:36:50.060
nerdy point of view definitely and we do such crazy antics as I guess the Yahoo

02:36:50.060 --> 02:36:54.460
Talkback because people on Yahoo are stupid and we do of course bad music and

02:36:54.460 --> 02:36:58.900
video game trivia have you listened to bad music and video game trivia yet

02:36:58.900 --> 02:37:05.180
Jamie no it's exciting what I do is I give video game trivia I question Brad

02:37:05.180 --> 02:37:09.420
and Irene on a certain topic like last week it was racing games was topic I

02:37:09.420 --> 02:37:13.940
quiz them on racing games and for every question they get wrong we bring up the

02:37:13.940 --> 02:37:18.540
the volume of some bad music, like last week was Barbra Streisand music.

02:37:18.540 --> 02:37:22.500
Barbra Streisand is cool.

02:37:22.500 --> 02:37:25.620
No matter what I pick, somebody always goes, but I like that person.

02:37:25.620 --> 02:37:30.460
The first week it was Enya, then it was Celine Dion, and somebody goes, Celine Dion, yeah.

02:37:30.460 --> 02:37:31.460
So you know whatever.

02:37:31.460 --> 02:37:34.900
Celine Dion has only done one good song and it was Meat Loaf.

02:37:34.900 --> 02:37:36.740
We talk a lot about Puzzle Pirates too.

02:37:36.740 --> 02:37:38.660
It's kind of turning into a Puzzle Pirates show almost.

02:37:38.660 --> 02:37:40.940
You don't play Ragnarok with me anymore.

02:37:40.940 --> 02:37:42.380
Because I didn't renew my account.

02:37:42.380 --> 02:37:45.060
I'm waiting for that other thing.

02:37:45.060 --> 02:37:46.660
Well, renew for another month and play with me.

02:37:46.660 --> 02:37:51.180
I'm waiting for the dyslexic rolo fan club to open up.

02:37:51.180 --> 02:37:52.100
That's all.

02:37:52.100 --> 02:37:53.700
Renew your account and play with me.

02:37:53.700 --> 02:37:54.980
I'll think about it.

02:37:54.980 --> 02:37:56.380
But I like Puzzle Pirates a lot.

02:37:56.380 --> 02:37:59.220
So that's it.

02:37:59.220 --> 02:38:02.200
That's what you can look for on my show.

02:38:02.200 --> 02:38:02.860
Tuesday nights.

02:38:02.860 --> 02:38:03.700
My show is Tuesday.

02:38:03.700 --> 02:38:06.020
It's basically, it's our request.

02:38:06.020 --> 02:38:08.860
It's called Pump Up the Volume because I'm

02:38:08.860 --> 02:38:12.340
a big 80s nerd fan.

02:38:12.340 --> 02:38:16.620
So it starts at 730, although I have a 7 o'clock pre-show,

02:38:16.620 --> 02:38:20.020
because I usually just have that on while I go to the bathroom.

02:38:20.020 --> 02:38:21.380
Oh, did I say that on the air?

02:38:21.380 --> 02:38:23.420
My dad.

02:38:23.420 --> 02:38:27.380
But no, it starts at 730, unless you want

02:38:27.380 --> 02:38:29.100
to catch the pre-show beforehand.

02:38:29.100 --> 02:38:31.180
I play request, so I hardly talk,

02:38:31.180 --> 02:38:33.820
so you don't have to listen to my crappy voice.

02:38:33.820 --> 02:38:36.160
I sometimes talk, discuss things.

02:38:36.160 --> 02:38:37.940
I'd like to have a guest, but no one ever

02:38:37.940 --> 02:38:39.480
wants to come hang out with me on Tuesday.

02:38:39.480 --> 02:38:41.780
I'd come some way, but you have me on this show.

02:38:41.780 --> 02:38:42.780
You have me on this show.

02:38:42.780 --> 02:38:43.780
Yeah, I don't need you on that.

02:38:43.780 --> 02:38:48.900
You need to get some other, you don't have other, you need to get, you need to get Shark

02:38:48.900 --> 02:38:51.020
Scroll or, I don't know.

02:38:51.020 --> 02:38:53.020
I'll try to arrange a guest.

02:38:53.020 --> 02:38:54.020
Get Dan.

02:38:54.020 --> 02:38:55.020
Dan's working Tuesday nights.

02:38:55.020 --> 02:38:58.020
That's why I do the show Tuesday.

02:38:58.020 --> 02:39:01.580
But if you're in our chat room, then you can send me a private message that night and I

02:39:01.580 --> 02:39:06.060
will play anything that you want, if I have it, or something by the same group.

02:39:06.060 --> 02:39:08.940
Unless you request like Spice Girls.

02:39:08.940 --> 02:39:10.940
I played Vitamin C.

02:39:10.940 --> 02:39:13.860
Vitamin C's Corvo.

02:39:13.860 --> 02:39:17.220
There's just very few things that are on my I Will Not playlist.

02:39:17.220 --> 02:39:21.540
And usually, that's a couple of songs.

02:39:21.540 --> 02:39:23.180
I want to hear Dirty.

02:39:23.180 --> 02:39:24.340
And Dirty.

02:39:24.340 --> 02:39:25.740
That won't be played on my show.

02:39:25.740 --> 02:39:27.740
That song sucks.

02:39:27.740 --> 02:39:30.060
By the way, I just have to say, at the depot last night,

02:39:30.060 --> 02:39:32.860
I saw the video of that.

02:39:32.860 --> 02:39:35.140
They played the video of the MTV Video Music Awards,

02:39:35.140 --> 02:39:36.260
that whole little thing.

02:39:36.260 --> 02:39:36.860
This is Richie?

02:39:36.860 --> 02:39:37.380
Fabulous.

02:39:37.380 --> 02:39:38.740
And you should have seen all the,

02:39:38.740 --> 02:39:40.420
because this is a gay bar, you should have seen all the gay

02:39:40.420 --> 02:39:44.580
guys reactions that it was great we're just all calling on say it's great it's

02:39:44.580 --> 02:39:56.420
fun anyway yeah sorry but it lasts until 1030 and then that's usually the point

02:39:56.420 --> 02:39:59.820
where I have to wait another 30 minutes for the right rock server to come back

02:39:59.820 --> 02:40:05.100
on so I can play more right rock like the addicts I am and it's it's fun I

02:40:05.100 --> 02:40:08.780
figured that's a chat room I figured that's why you did your show Tuesday

02:40:08.780 --> 02:40:13.980
night because that was RO maintenance night. This Tuesday though, I was going to be doing

02:40:13.980 --> 02:40:20.340
video game music trivia again, but I won't be able to do it because I'm going to be talking

02:40:20.340 --> 02:40:25.260
as little as possible. I'm trying to let my lungs recover.

02:40:25.260 --> 02:40:31.660
Which is different than the video game music trivia I'm doing because she's literally video

02:40:31.660 --> 02:40:38.660
game music trivia. I have multiple questions style, so if you

02:40:38.660 --> 02:40:42.620
guess what it's from what level it's from give me as much as you know about

02:40:42.620 --> 02:40:48.100
this music you'll get a point for it cool so your nerdiness pays off because

02:40:48.100 --> 02:40:51.540
I'll give you a dollar if you win it pays to get points of dark savory

02:40:51.540 --> 02:40:59.420
somebody somebody dethrone dark test yet please and then we have our Wednesday

02:40:59.420 --> 02:41:06.420
show bacon man actually Wednesdays is condition zero but zero didn't make it

02:41:06.420 --> 02:41:10.340
last week so I don't know he's got another week otherwise we may be looking

02:41:10.340 --> 02:41:14.660
for something else to put on Wednesdays sorry but if he this is two weeks in a

02:41:14.660 --> 02:41:18.660
row I'm just if he misses two weeks in a row I'm just going to assume he doesn't

02:41:18.660 --> 02:41:25.660
want to do it we'll think of something creative for Wednesday I do have a

02:41:25.660 --> 02:41:34.980
backup show that's ready to go not a live show though I will see okay my show

02:41:34.980 --> 02:41:43.900
Livewire, every Thursday, 7 o'clock. Hour long pre-show. Usually, I've been doing now

02:41:43.900 --> 02:41:51.140
like the show before, kind of replaying the show previous to it. And this week on Livewire

02:41:51.140 --> 02:41:56.260
we're going to be doing kind of like a non-stop of every single Livewire so far, all five

02:41:56.260 --> 02:42:01.100
shows because it's my birthday and I'm not going to be here to do this. So I'm going

02:42:01.100 --> 02:42:07.320
to have them all remixed together. Basically, I'm just going to redo every set without my

02:42:07.320 --> 02:42:13.420
voice on it and mix together better. So, you know, have those and you'll get to hear them

02:42:13.420 --> 02:42:18.860
non-stop and at the very end, there'll be something special for you listeners who stay

02:42:18.860 --> 02:42:24.980
tuned. It was going to be a new Loki remix, but I played that tonight, so it might be

02:42:24.980 --> 02:42:25.980
...

02:42:25.980 --> 02:42:26.980
He blew his wad.

02:42:26.980 --> 02:42:30.300
No, it might be another one. I don't know. We'll see.

02:42:30.300 --> 02:42:42.340
I would like to see a strung together mix of all Dark Sakura has a show, Tuesday night.

02:42:42.340 --> 02:42:44.260
That's what she was just talking about.

02:42:44.260 --> 02:42:47.980
Thursday night's live wire, yes.

02:42:47.980 --> 02:42:53.820
Yeah, so we might do a little something special at the end there for those who tune in for

02:42:53.820 --> 02:42:57.420
the long, long set of music that's going to be there.

02:42:57.420 --> 02:43:05.940
I'm starting the show earlier this week. It's going to be at six because it's so long. There's

02:43:05.940 --> 02:43:10.060
a lot of cool sets in there. There's the first one, which is just generic trance stuff. Second

02:43:10.060 --> 02:43:15.020
set, which is old school music, 70s and 80s remixes, which is really sweet. Then there's

02:43:15.020 --> 02:43:24.540
also, what was it? Week two was a darker trance music. Week three was old school stuff. Week

02:43:24.540 --> 02:43:32.340
before was Livewire, the motion picture score, kind of like a score-type music. And then

02:43:32.340 --> 02:43:40.420
last week's, which was Fuck the RIAA, which was independent indie artists versus commercial

02:43:40.420 --> 02:43:42.060
artists, and it was pretty sweet.

02:43:42.060 --> 02:43:49.060
Very cool. Livewire is such a great show, it's getting me into mixing, even. And I did

02:43:49.060 --> 02:43:54.420
a megamix that I played after Vanilla Sky one week. And if I do it more regularly, I

02:43:54.420 --> 02:43:58.520
might find some spare time on the station to air. I'm like on a Saturday afternoon or

02:43:58.520 --> 02:44:04.740
something, but who knows? I don't want to take any thunder away from Loki, but he's

02:44:04.740 --> 02:44:08.900
way better at it than I am. He can do it on the fly better than I can.

02:44:08.900 --> 02:44:14.580
Yeah, and I really do literally on the fly because the last few weeks I've been really

02:44:14.580 --> 02:44:18.920
slacking on getting my show together, and I literally, I'm working on the show until

02:44:18.920 --> 02:44:22.740
like the last three seconds. Literally, so.

02:44:22.740 --> 02:44:24.180
All right, so Orange Lounge Radio.

02:44:24.180 --> 02:44:26.940
Live programming every Sunday through Thursday night.

02:44:26.940 --> 02:44:29.060
Well, Wednesdays are questionable recently,

02:44:29.060 --> 02:44:29.860
but we'll see.

02:44:29.860 --> 02:44:31.180
We're going to work on that.

02:44:31.180 --> 02:44:34.620
Anyway, as promised, you guys can ask us questions now.

02:44:34.620 --> 02:44:36.660
It's Ask Orange Lounge.

02:44:36.660 --> 02:44:39.380
So if you want to ask us a question,

02:44:39.380 --> 02:44:43.100
head on to our chat room, www.calibomani.com,

02:44:43.100 --> 02:44:46.100
click on Orange Lounge, and click on Chat.

02:44:46.100 --> 02:44:50.460
And you can ask myself, Loki, or Jamie any question you want.

02:44:50.460 --> 02:44:53.460
it's one of our favorite segments to do on the show especially when we're

02:44:53.460 --> 02:44:56.060
desperate for filler material which was off

02:44:56.060 --> 02:44:57.540
excuse me often

02:44:57.540 --> 02:45:02.540
especially in a slow bimani newsweek as it has been lately

02:45:02.540 --> 02:45:06.140
uh... what day of the week is max two supposed to come out twenty fourth right

02:45:06.140 --> 02:45:08.640
that's a wednesday

02:45:08.640 --> 02:45:10.820
we might be doing something uh...

02:45:10.820 --> 02:45:13.380
we'll have to do something a day that max two comes out just to add that in there

02:45:13.380 --> 02:45:14.680
anyway

02:45:14.680 --> 02:45:21.680
let's talk about orange lounge, or ask orange lounge

02:45:24.220 --> 02:45:26.040
let's ask orange lounge

02:45:26.040 --> 02:45:27.960
some stupid question

02:45:27.960 --> 02:45:33.760
who will get yelled at this week on orange lounge, asks segment

02:45:33.760 --> 02:45:35.260
da da da da

02:45:35.260 --> 02:45:37.700
i like cheese, i like milk

02:45:37.700 --> 02:45:39.900
they give me gas, alright

02:45:39.900 --> 02:45:43.100
i'm gonna do something by the way

02:45:43.100 --> 02:45:45.620
That I haven't done in a year.

02:45:45.620 --> 02:45:48.060
You're gonna eat bacon? Two years.

02:45:48.060 --> 02:45:49.820
I'm going to eat bacon.

02:45:49.820 --> 02:45:54.820
His bacon is yummy.

02:45:54.820 --> 02:46:00.900
Now I know why I don't eat pork anymore.

02:46:00.900 --> 02:46:07.580
I'm just hungry and sick.

02:46:07.580 --> 02:46:15.300
First question, Evil Naoki 2DX, oh, it's a shameless plug, it's not an ask question,

02:46:15.300 --> 02:46:22.460
it's just a shameless plug. Here it is. Japantown Anime Fair is this weekend at San Francisco's

02:46:22.460 --> 02:46:32.820
Japantown. It's at the Radisson Miyako Hotel and the Best Western Miyako Inn. Only $12

02:46:32.820 --> 02:46:34.740
for the weekend or $8 for one day.

02:46:34.740 --> 02:46:40.620
You want more info, www.jtaf.com for more info.

02:46:40.620 --> 02:46:43.020
Let me know if you need me to work.

02:46:43.020 --> 02:46:43.500
I will.

02:46:43.500 --> 02:46:45.060
I'll cosplay there.

02:46:45.060 --> 02:46:48.340
In my bike-in costume.

02:46:48.340 --> 02:46:49.500
23rd Magus.

02:46:49.500 --> 02:46:54.300
Loki, how would you go about setting an initial demachine

02:46:54.300 --> 02:46:55.260
on fire?

02:46:55.260 --> 02:46:58.780
I need help on my technique.

02:46:58.780 --> 02:47:00.180
Gas.

02:47:00.180 --> 02:47:01.460
Fire.

02:47:01.460 --> 02:47:14.580
I think if I eat any more of my arteries, they're seriously going to be clogged.

02:47:14.580 --> 02:47:17.420
I'm running out of food, so that means I have to take my diet pretty soon.

02:47:17.420 --> 02:47:21.140
Except I have a huge thing of mashed potatoes in there, so I have to go through those first.

02:47:21.140 --> 02:47:22.540
I don't need to eat any more bacon.

02:47:22.540 --> 02:47:25.940
I think my mouth is catching SARS or something.

02:47:25.940 --> 02:47:27.780
Our kitchen's all full of grease.

02:47:27.780 --> 02:47:29.420
I'm going to have some more V8.

02:47:29.420 --> 02:47:32.260
Here, hold this.

02:47:32.260 --> 02:47:34.160
So gasoline in a match.

02:47:34.160 --> 02:47:34.660
Yeah.

02:47:34.660 --> 02:47:37.340
That would be my advice, too.

02:47:37.340 --> 02:47:39.780
Late at night when no one's working, you have to excuse me.

02:47:39.780 --> 02:47:41.140
I have a mouth full of bacon.

02:47:41.140 --> 02:47:42.940
Or if you want, what you should do

02:47:42.940 --> 02:47:46.220
is pour gas over the circuitry and then leave it.

02:47:46.220 --> 02:47:48.500
So when they turn it on and the game boots up,

02:47:48.500 --> 02:47:51.940
then it catches on fire and blows up.

02:47:51.940 --> 02:47:53.940
Well, fine.

02:47:53.940 --> 02:47:57.060
We need that safe home stuff that we have in the campaign.

02:47:57.060 --> 02:47:57.700
Yeah.

02:47:57.700 --> 02:47:59.020
Better than that.

02:47:59.020 --> 02:48:02.440
Just go in the little cabinet where you sit in to play the game

02:48:02.440 --> 02:48:06.540
and take a dump. It's the worst than setting the machine on fire.

02:48:06.540 --> 02:48:09.700
They need that blue napalm stuff that we had when we went camping.

02:48:09.700 --> 02:48:14.280
Because that stuff is cool.

02:48:14.280 --> 02:48:15.580
Jason,

02:48:15.580 --> 02:48:17.160
our friend Jason,

02:48:17.160 --> 02:48:20.500
would like to know, he says, although I can't hear the answer,

02:48:20.500 --> 02:48:24.340
why? Why aren't you listening? Why? What is wrong with you?

02:48:24.340 --> 02:48:29.740
He'd like to ask OrangeLounge, why does this weekend feel so angsty-like?

02:48:29.740 --> 02:48:36.740
I don't know. I don't feel angsty. I don't know. I don't have your fucking problems.

02:48:37.160 --> 02:48:38.340
You're too tired to feel angsty.

02:48:38.340 --> 02:48:42.700
I really am. It sounds like Sylvester Stallone. Well, Jason,

02:48:42.700 --> 02:48:48.300
you're probably angsty because of where you live.

02:48:48.300 --> 02:48:49.620
I'm so mean.

02:48:49.620 --> 02:48:54.180
Come to California. It's nice here.

02:48:54.180 --> 02:48:56.860
Yeah, we have a good political system.

02:48:56.860 --> 02:49:00.140
Baca says, I love Orange Lounge.

02:49:00.140 --> 02:49:01.420
Aw, how nice.

02:49:01.420 --> 02:49:02.940
There was no question there, though.

02:49:02.940 --> 02:49:04.260
What did you get?

02:49:04.260 --> 02:49:05.540
What were you talking about?

02:49:05.540 --> 02:49:06.540
Hey, what did you get?

02:49:06.540 --> 02:49:07.580
He, he, silly me.

02:49:07.580 --> 02:49:10.140
I'm getting all these little bits and pieces of a message

02:49:10.140 --> 02:49:11.180
here.

02:49:11.180 --> 02:49:12.780
No question, though.

02:49:12.780 --> 02:49:15.060
I'm really interested to see if the rain comes out

02:49:15.060 --> 02:49:16.260
because I forgot my clothes.

02:49:16.260 --> 02:49:17.780
So we'll move on to DCB.

02:49:17.780 --> 02:49:20.340
Hi, guys.

02:49:20.340 --> 02:49:22.260
Oh, this is interesting.

02:49:22.260 --> 02:49:24.700
DCB wants to know every cast member's opinion on this.

02:49:24.700 --> 02:49:29.460
Who is outright cooler, Al Roker or Bob Saget?

02:49:29.460 --> 02:49:32.460
And which one would you rather have live at your house?

02:49:32.460 --> 02:49:33.780
Loki.

02:49:33.780 --> 02:49:36.300
Al Roker is the weather guy on the Today Show.

02:49:36.300 --> 02:49:38.380
It's going to rain.

02:49:38.380 --> 02:49:40.260
I don't watch TV, thank you.

02:49:40.260 --> 02:49:42.420
Al Roker had his stomach stapled,

02:49:42.420 --> 02:49:43.900
and now he looks really thin.

02:49:43.900 --> 02:49:45.300
It's kind of scary.

02:49:45.300 --> 02:49:49.180
But Bob Saget's cool because, one, he played a stoner

02:49:49.180 --> 02:49:56.180
in

02:49:57.600 --> 02:50:00.920
he's shit all over my bathroom there's shit everywhere

02:50:00.920 --> 02:50:04.780
there's shit on the mirror there's shit here

02:50:04.780 --> 02:50:08.460
i would also have to say that Bobs as much as i love Al Roker

02:50:08.460 --> 02:50:11.900
Bobs Saggit is cooler

02:50:11.900 --> 02:50:17.560
because yeah i used to suck dick for coke

02:50:17.560 --> 02:50:20.160
Who would I rather have live in the house, though?

02:50:20.160 --> 02:50:21.160
Al Roker.

02:50:21.160 --> 02:50:22.160
I'd rather have Al Roker live in the house.

02:50:22.160 --> 02:50:23.160
Why?

02:50:23.160 --> 02:50:25.640
Bob Saget used to clean up everything.

02:50:25.640 --> 02:50:27.680
But Al Roker can predict the weather.

02:50:27.680 --> 02:50:29.040
Yeah, right.

02:50:29.040 --> 02:50:30.040
Uh-huh.

02:50:30.040 --> 02:50:31.840
Like he can predict his diet.

02:50:31.840 --> 02:50:32.840
You know what?

02:50:32.840 --> 02:50:35.240
It doesn't matter which one's chosen because the moment they set foot in my house, legally

02:50:35.240 --> 02:50:37.840
I can shoot them.

02:50:37.840 --> 02:50:44.480
Did you hear about this, Jamie, about this news story about the guy who tried to rob

02:50:44.480 --> 02:50:48.320
the bank, and he had that explosive collar around his neck?

02:50:48.320 --> 02:50:51.960
I know, that was cool! I'd do that.

02:50:51.960 --> 02:50:54.040
His real life battle royale.

02:50:54.040 --> 02:50:59.660
Except it wasn't like all contained, it was like wired. But still.

02:50:59.660 --> 02:51:02.560
Hey, it's a step in the right direction.

02:51:02.560 --> 02:51:06.020
All they need to do is just compact it and put it on children.

02:51:06.020 --> 02:51:06.700
Yes.

02:51:06.700 --> 02:51:08.120
That'd make me happy.

02:51:08.120 --> 02:51:09.580
I didn't find you in class.

02:51:09.580 --> 02:51:13.500
Now Susie, if you want to live, you better get this math question correctly.

02:51:13.500 --> 02:51:16.820
You're acting up in class, remote control.

02:51:16.820 --> 02:51:21.940
Beep, beep, beep. Everybody better run.

02:51:21.940 --> 02:51:26.140
Maple speaks and is asking us a question.

02:51:26.140 --> 02:51:30.060
Gasp. First he wants to know, how do I go about listening?

02:51:30.060 --> 02:51:33.300
Well, it's easy.

02:51:33.300 --> 02:51:36.740
You know what, if you're here, you're obviously listening, but

02:51:36.740 --> 02:51:40.500
In case you forget, you can always go to, and I'll send this over private message to

02:51:40.500 --> 02:51:50.220
Maple, just in case you really isn't listening. You can go to our website. It's at orangelounge.sky.cx,

02:51:50.220 --> 02:51:55.220
but not for much longer. Hopefully, only one more week on that. Right? Right, kids?

02:51:55.220 --> 02:51:57.060
Hey, someone was supposed to be working on that website.

02:51:57.060 --> 02:52:01.060
Yeah, well, it didn't happen. I was too busy sucking dick for coke.

02:52:01.060 --> 02:52:05.580
Here, coke head. See, I told you that it was, it looks like a drug market.

02:52:05.580 --> 02:52:06.580
Diet Coke!

02:52:06.580 --> 02:52:12.340
Anyway, Mabel would also like to know, why am I so cool?

02:52:12.340 --> 02:52:15.740
Oh, he ate a nasty piece of the bacon.

02:52:15.740 --> 02:52:16.900
Loki choked on bacon?

02:52:16.900 --> 02:52:18.660
Why does that ask that question?

02:52:18.660 --> 02:52:20.220
No, it wasn't a choke on bacon.

02:52:20.220 --> 02:52:22.700
It was a piece of the seasoning stuff I got,

02:52:22.700 --> 02:52:25.780
and there was like nice crunchy, charcoal-y taste.

02:52:25.780 --> 02:52:27.780
I was like, oh, oh.

02:52:27.780 --> 02:52:30.700
It's nasty bacon.

02:52:30.700 --> 02:52:32.220
Oh, water.

02:52:32.220 --> 02:52:33.660
Loki's got that nasty bacon.

02:52:33.660 --> 02:52:37.660
Mabel wants to know why he's so cool.

02:52:37.660 --> 02:52:42.860
If you got the ice cubes out of your pants, maybe you wouldn't be.

02:52:42.860 --> 02:52:44.820
I like that answer.

02:52:44.820 --> 02:52:46.060
I am done with the bacon.

02:52:46.060 --> 02:52:47.620
Bacon is done.

02:52:47.620 --> 02:52:50.980
Mabel's cool because he's really laid back.

02:52:50.980 --> 02:52:52.500
He's a laid back guy.

02:52:52.500 --> 02:52:53.000
I like that.

02:53:00.780 --> 02:53:02.280
Moving on, John Fields would like

02:53:02.280 --> 02:53:06.080
There's no little kids that run across the DDR pads.

02:53:06.080 --> 02:53:10.120
What would you do to them if you didn't get in trouble for it?

02:53:10.120 --> 02:53:11.120
Trip them.

02:53:11.120 --> 02:53:15.160
I do all the time.

02:53:15.160 --> 02:53:18.720
I would push them down a flight of stairs.

02:53:18.720 --> 02:53:23.040
I would hang them by hooks through their skin on their back, and then I'd pour hot oil on

02:53:23.040 --> 02:53:27.880
their back, and then after they kept screaming, I'd stick sharp needles through their chin

02:53:27.880 --> 02:53:32.760
them through the sides of their cheeks and then through their chest. No, tell us how

02:53:32.760 --> 02:53:41.040
you really feel. Of course, I was taken from Eat You to Kill Her, awesome movie. Then I'd

02:53:41.040 --> 02:53:50.240
cut off their nipples. Baka would like to admit he is random. We figured that out. Baka

02:53:50.240 --> 02:53:56.120
would also like us to define its definition time. Define angst.

02:53:56.120 --> 02:54:13.200
Alright, do this, Rob. Go pull up Internet Explorer, type in www.dictionary.com. Type

02:54:13.200 --> 02:54:22.480
the word angst angst by definition a feeling of anxiety or apprehension often

02:54:22.480 --> 02:54:28.120
accompanied by depression that's what angst means and now you know and knowing

02:54:28.120 --> 02:54:36.120
is half the battle go Joe now this well here's the second part define for who

02:54:36.120 --> 02:54:42.120
That's the sound you make after I kick your ass.

02:54:42.120 --> 02:54:49.120
That's the sound of Jamie's leg going right at your balls.

02:54:49.120 --> 02:54:56.120
That's my Japanese porn star name.

02:54:56.120 --> 02:55:01.120
That's my Japanese porn star name.

02:55:01.120 --> 02:55:04.080
See, you don't know it's me because I'm all mosaic-ed out,

02:55:04.080 --> 02:55:06.760
but that's me.

02:55:06.760 --> 02:55:09.800
I'm a stunt cock.

02:55:09.800 --> 02:55:12.920
We're out of questions.

02:55:12.920 --> 02:55:17.880
Does anybody in the room have a question for somebody else?

02:55:17.880 --> 02:55:24.280
Dear chat room, why do I own you so much for free?

02:55:24.280 --> 02:55:27.760
Dear chat room, I look at my PayPal account every day,

02:55:27.760 --> 02:55:29.280
and there's no other money in there.

02:55:29.280 --> 02:55:32.960
Why hasn't anyone given me money?

02:55:32.960 --> 02:55:37.080
Nightmare underscore Hunter.

02:55:37.080 --> 02:55:39.520
Why would none of you let me pimp you out?

02:55:39.520 --> 02:55:40.640
We got questions.

02:55:40.640 --> 02:55:41.680
We're saved.

02:55:41.680 --> 02:55:43.760
OK.

02:55:43.760 --> 02:55:49.680
Maple would like to know, only who can prevent forest fires?

02:55:49.680 --> 02:55:50.600
Not me.

02:55:50.600 --> 02:55:54.080
Shit, I scarred him.

02:55:54.080 --> 02:55:57.440
Actually, I actually used to live, or I kind of live,

02:55:57.440 --> 02:55:59.420
We kind of live in the middle of a forest, right?

02:55:59.420 --> 02:56:02.020
And there was that fire just two blocks down the street

02:56:02.020 --> 02:56:02.960
a couple weeks ago.

02:56:02.960 --> 02:56:05.220
So the fire department can prevent forest fires

02:56:05.220 --> 02:56:06.300
from consuming your home.

02:56:06.300 --> 02:56:10.580
Because if they hadn't acted so fast, we could have been dead.

02:56:10.580 --> 02:56:11.420
No, we were at work.

02:56:11.420 --> 02:56:13.700
If a bear tried to prevent forest fires,

02:56:13.700 --> 02:56:16.740
he would just get consumed in the flames and die.

02:56:16.740 --> 02:56:19.140
Only God can prevent forest fires.

02:56:19.140 --> 02:56:22.280
Start praying, children.

02:56:22.280 --> 02:56:25.220
All of a sudden, this is a religious show.

02:56:25.220 --> 02:56:29.620
I know Live 365 had a lot of religious stations, but shit.

02:56:29.620 --> 02:56:33.660
We need to do that thing where we go on to other Live 365

02:56:33.660 --> 02:56:35.980
stations, like the Christian Rock channels and things like

02:56:35.980 --> 02:56:36.900
that, and make fun of them.

02:56:36.900 --> 02:56:38.900
Listen to them and make fun of them.

02:56:38.900 --> 02:56:42.140
Maybe another time.

02:56:42.140 --> 02:56:43.860
I can do that.

02:56:43.860 --> 02:56:49.220
DCB would like to know, why do women have boobs?

02:56:49.220 --> 02:56:51.220
He has an answer, though, too.

02:56:51.220 --> 02:56:52.620
So you have something to look at when

02:56:52.620 --> 02:56:55.060
you're talking to them.

02:56:55.060 --> 02:57:02.060
If you could see Jamie's face.

02:57:04.540 --> 02:57:10.420
I'm trying not to laugh.

02:57:10.420 --> 02:57:12.420
See,

02:57:12.420 --> 02:57:17.980
we have cushioning where you guys have targets.

02:57:17.980 --> 02:57:21.940
Think about it.

02:57:21.940 --> 02:57:27.540
I don't know, why do women have boobs? I mean, obviously the breast milk's there, but they

02:57:27.540 --> 02:57:35.020
don't have to be so big some of the time. I mean, babies don't drink that much.

02:57:35.020 --> 02:57:36.020
Estrogen! Hello?

02:57:36.020 --> 02:57:38.380
Yeah, but still.

02:57:38.380 --> 02:57:42.780
I'm talking like Jerry Springer boobs. Why do people get the boobs back?

02:57:42.780 --> 02:57:45.220
What I understand is my nuts aren't that big, so I mean...

02:57:45.220 --> 02:57:48.060
Yeah, that's true. Why can't my nuts be as big as women's boobs?

02:57:48.060 --> 02:57:52.260
That would really hurt.

02:57:52.260 --> 02:57:55.900
Having boobs does not hurt unless you have really big boobs and then your back hurts

02:57:55.900 --> 02:57:56.900
all the time.

02:57:56.900 --> 02:58:02.540
I'm not even going to get started on that one.

02:58:02.540 --> 02:58:04.900
I know I have big boobs.

02:58:04.900 --> 02:58:07.580
You have nice boobs.

02:58:07.580 --> 02:58:08.580
You have nice boobs.

02:58:08.580 --> 02:58:11.460
Don't look at my boobs.

02:58:11.460 --> 02:58:12.460
It's okay.

02:58:12.460 --> 02:58:13.460
He's no gay.

02:58:13.460 --> 02:58:25.280
I know you have a boob fixation but I would say that when you get it like into

02:58:25.280 --> 02:58:29.420
like the double D's and more that there were these women at my elementary school

02:58:29.420 --> 02:58:33.660
I was so afraid of them because they had boobs that were as big as me when I was

02:58:33.660 --> 02:58:41.220
five and that's the time to go save up your money and go get a boob job because

02:58:41.220 --> 02:58:45.820
that's too heavy. When you have boobs large enough to hold matrix babies in them, that's

02:58:45.820 --> 02:58:52.080
when you have to be concerned. Actually, I'm not kidding. They were that large. The ones

02:58:52.080 --> 02:58:55.500
that get like the triple G. I don't get like, when I watched Geraldo one day, these women

02:58:55.500 --> 02:59:01.140
were like expanding themselves as novelty models. What the hell's the point of it? You

02:59:01.140 --> 02:59:06.140
know, why don't they like add squirrel tails or something like that. You know something

02:59:06.140 --> 02:59:16.580
The people with small boobs who want big boobs, you know what, be happy with what you have

02:59:16.580 --> 02:59:25.180
because having big boobs isn't everything except you get a lot more dates.

02:59:25.180 --> 02:59:26.180
Questions from Maple.

02:59:26.180 --> 02:59:28.180
I'm afraid to ask this one.

02:59:28.180 --> 02:59:30.180
What is the best racist joke you know of?

02:59:30.180 --> 02:59:34.180
I don't think we need to answer that one, although I'll turn it to Loki.

02:59:34.180 --> 02:59:35.420
No, we're not going to answer that.

02:59:35.420 --> 02:59:41.920
even go there. I'll tell a Helen Keller joke. Those are funny. How do Helen Keller's parents

02:59:41.920 --> 02:59:51.920
punish her? How? By rearranging the furniture. It's funny because she's blind. That's not

02:59:51.920 --> 02:59:58.520
really racist, but you know. I have a deaf joke. A deaf joke, okay. Of course I learned

02:59:58.520 --> 03:00:04.880
this joke from a deaf person. Three people were, there was a big conference and a deaf

03:00:04.880 --> 03:00:12.720
guy was sitting with an American guy and there was a Russian guy and a Mexican guy. No, I'm

03:00:12.720 --> 03:00:17.620
not Mexican, a Cuban guy. And Cuban guy stands up and goes, walks over to a window. He takes

03:00:17.620 --> 03:00:23.060
a puff of a cigar and throws it out the window. And the deaf guy signs to him, why did you

03:00:23.060 --> 03:00:26.440
throw the cigar out the window? He's like, oh, that's pretty. Cigars in Cuba, hey, Cuban

03:00:26.440 --> 03:00:32.000
cigars. So the deaf guy just sits back and goes along with watching the conference. And

03:00:32.000 --> 03:00:35.760
And then the Russian guy gets up and takes a big swig of vodka and throws a bottle out

03:00:35.760 --> 03:00:36.760
the window.

03:00:36.760 --> 03:00:38.760
He's like, well, why'd you throw the vodka out the window?

03:00:38.760 --> 03:00:42.280
Throw your vodka in Russia, you know, Russia, vodka.

03:00:42.280 --> 03:00:44.960
So the deaf guy's sitting there, he's thinking.

03:00:44.960 --> 03:00:48.520
Swig goes up and opens the window, picks up the American guy and throws him out the window.

03:00:48.520 --> 03:00:50.160
He's like, where'd you do that?

03:00:50.160 --> 03:00:54.400
Plenty of hearing people in America.

03:00:54.400 --> 03:00:55.400
I have a gay joke.

03:00:55.400 --> 03:00:59.660
How do you make a gay guy scream twice?

03:00:59.660 --> 03:01:09.380
him in the ass and then wipe your cock on the curtains. Mabel would also like to know,

03:01:09.380 --> 03:01:15.180
when you were talking about big boobs, were you making fun of me being fat? I don't know

03:01:15.180 --> 03:01:23.940
how he gets fat out of that. Yes. Do your boobs produce milk? Do you drink a lot of

03:01:23.940 --> 03:01:28.540
breast milk? You know they have lactation pads that you can put in your bra now. We

03:01:28.540 --> 03:01:32.500
should get you some. Now that's making fun, see?

03:01:32.500 --> 03:01:35.460
Why are people so, you know... Why are people self-conscious?

03:01:35.460 --> 03:01:38.420
I don't know. It's like you have your own creamer. It's awesome.

03:01:38.420 --> 03:01:45.500
Well, you know, I would be self-conscious if you... Okay. First of all, if you've never...

03:01:45.500 --> 03:01:47.220
That's the other reason why I'm not having children.

03:01:47.220 --> 03:01:49.620
Dude, I can't even... I can't even find you.

03:01:49.620 --> 03:01:53.180
Uh, Mabel, it also... No, no, no. After sitting for 30 minutes listening to

03:01:53.180 --> 03:01:57.580
my stepsister telling me about what it feels like to lactate, no children for me, thank

03:01:57.580 --> 03:01:58.580
Thank you.

03:01:58.580 --> 03:02:01.580
I'll come back to Mabel's last question a little bit.

03:02:01.580 --> 03:02:04.820
Nince would like to say, not a question, but a comment.

03:02:04.820 --> 03:02:10.220
If only God can prevent forest fires, well then they'll always start.

03:02:10.220 --> 03:02:11.900
Thank you.

03:02:11.900 --> 03:02:15.700
You the funny.

03:02:15.700 --> 03:02:19.020
Rice Princess is asking when we're going to update the damn website because she doesn't

03:02:19.020 --> 03:02:22.380
want to plug it if it's not updated.

03:02:22.380 --> 03:02:31.060
We've made steps to get a new website constructed, but it's just coming along slowly.

03:02:31.060 --> 03:02:32.820
We need to have it done soon though.

03:02:32.820 --> 03:02:33.820
I know we do.

03:02:33.820 --> 03:02:34.820
So hopefully this week.

03:02:34.820 --> 03:02:35.820
Yes?

03:02:35.820 --> 03:02:40.700
I feel like an alien is going to pop out of my stomach.

03:02:40.700 --> 03:02:43.700
You'll be okay though, right?

03:02:43.700 --> 03:02:47.600
See, I'm immune to the pork and grease.

03:02:47.600 --> 03:02:52.140
John Field says, should Weird Al do a parody of a Linkin Park song?

03:02:52.140 --> 03:02:53.140
Yes.

03:02:53.140 --> 03:02:54.140
No.

03:02:54.140 --> 03:02:55.140
Yeah, he has.

03:02:55.140 --> 03:02:56.140
Has he?

03:02:56.140 --> 03:02:57.140
What?

03:02:57.140 --> 03:02:58.140
Angry wife boy polka.

03:02:58.140 --> 03:02:59.140
Is Lincoln Park in there?

03:02:59.140 --> 03:03:00.140
It might be.

03:03:00.140 --> 03:03:01.140
Oh.

03:03:01.140 --> 03:03:03.020
Gurr would like to know, why is it so hard to get rid of hiccups?

03:03:03.020 --> 03:03:12.700
I don't know, why is it so hard to get rid of Mexicans?

03:03:12.700 --> 03:03:16.340
Thank you for answering two questions and one there with Naples joke as well.

03:03:16.340 --> 03:03:18.220
Thank you.

03:03:18.220 --> 03:03:24.980
I just thought I'd like to address the other comment there. I don't know. I'm not really

03:03:24.980 --> 03:03:35.100
racist. I just play one on the radio. Okay. Maple's last question. Why aren't you accepting

03:03:35.100 --> 03:03:41.820
any more questions? Because, kids, it's the end of the show. And Ask Orange Lounge is

03:03:41.820 --> 03:03:52.540
Is now over and done.

03:03:52.540 --> 03:03:54.220
Let's not shoot a dead horse.

03:03:54.220 --> 03:03:55.980
Let's get on to the next segment.

03:03:55.980 --> 03:03:57.700
I'm going to peek from the pork.

03:03:57.700 --> 03:03:59.860
The pork is really nasty.

03:03:59.860 --> 03:04:01.500
Okay.

03:04:01.500 --> 03:04:05.780
Um, final thoughts?

03:04:05.780 --> 03:04:09.680
Thank God the pork is gone.

03:04:09.680 --> 03:04:14.720
I'm not eating any more bacon for a while.

03:04:14.720 --> 03:04:21.920
My final thought is I hate Walmart, no I'm not going to get over it.

03:04:21.920 --> 03:04:24.880
Now I remember why I gave up pork.

03:04:24.880 --> 03:04:30.920
I'm also very sad because I just spent $340 in arcade buttons.

03:04:30.920 --> 03:04:33.040
That is sad.

03:04:33.040 --> 03:04:34.040
Final word of the show.

03:04:34.040 --> 03:04:39.040
I had to take it myself. I'll give it to Jamie. I know she always likes to have the final word. Here it is.

03:04:42.040 --> 03:04:47.040
The final word of the evening is puce.

03:04:48.040 --> 03:04:57.040
You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio. Orange Lounge Radio is hosted by Dark Sakura, Skye, and Loki. We expect you a nice play again.

03:04:57.040 --> 03:05:04.040
nice play again. And now, here's your fortune cookie message of the day.

03:05:27.040 --> 03:05:31.040
I rock a mic like a vandal Light up a stage and watch me jump like a

03:05:31.040 --> 03:05:34.040
candle Damn, yeah, I'm kickin' that boom

03:05:34.040 --> 03:05:40.040
I'm poisonous like a poisonous mushroom If there is a problem, yo, I'll solve it

03:05:40.040 --> 03:05:48.040
Check out the hook while my DJ revolves it Ice, ice, baby, too cold, too ho

03:05:48.040 --> 03:05:54.040
Ice, ice, baby, too cold, too ho

03:05:54.040 --> 03:06:00.040
Rollin' in my grave, although with my rag top down so my hair can blow

03:06:00.040 --> 03:06:03.040
Girlies on standby, waitin' just to say hi

03:06:03.040 --> 03:06:06.040
Did I stop? No, I just rode by

03:06:06.040 --> 03:06:09.040
Should I stop? Hey, I don't know

03:06:09.040 --> 03:06:12.040
Turn the light and I'll blow

03:06:12.040 --> 03:06:15.040
To the extreme, I rock a mic like a vandal

03:06:15.040 --> 03:06:18.040
Light up the stage and watch me jump like a candle

03:06:18.040 --> 03:06:21.040
Damn, yeah, I'm kickin' that food

03:06:21.040 --> 03:06:28.040

03:06:28.040 --> 03:06:39.040

03:06:39.040 --> 03:06:55.680
Thanks for listening and we'll see you next week.

03:07:09.040 --> 03:07:34.040
I

03:07:34.040 --> 03:07:58.040
I want to talk about the Trivial Pursuit game that we played Monday night.

03:07:58.040 --> 03:08:00.040
Was it this Monday?

03:08:00.040 --> 03:08:06.740
Yes. Monday was so funny. We played Trivial Pursuit. We brought...okay. It was after Vanilla

03:08:06.740 --> 03:08:10.480
Sky we decided to go out and get a board game. So we went to Walmart. This was pre-Evil.

03:08:10.480 --> 03:08:15.080
We went to Walmart and bought Trivial Pursuit, the 20th anniversary edition, and brought

03:08:15.080 --> 03:08:19.900
it home and played. It was me, Brad, Irene, Loki, and Nellie, Loki's girlfriend. We were

03:08:19.900 --> 03:08:24.220
all playing. And hilarity. It was absolutely hilarious. We got some of the most funniest

03:08:24.220 --> 03:08:27.780
answers ever. Like, I was asking Nellie a question. I was trying to get everybody's

03:08:27.780 --> 03:08:31.580
attention because everybody was talking. I wanted to ask a question, so I went, which?

03:08:31.580 --> 03:08:36.660
And I was like, which? I was starting the question, which one of the, and Irene's all,

03:08:36.660 --> 03:08:41.420
don't call her a witch. It was funny, had to be there. And then we learned that there

03:08:41.420 --> 03:08:48.220
is a cat exhibit at the local aquarium. And we also learned that Stephen King directed

03:08:48.220 --> 03:08:56.900
E.T. I'm going to get punched in the face for that one, but that's okay. I got to fuck

03:08:56.900 --> 03:09:05.580
you Rob I gotta fuck you I'm sorry what what Jamie Jamie has clean clothes she's

03:09:05.580 --> 03:09:08.860
celebrating I can smell clean clothes because the fans blowing the clean

03:09:08.860 --> 03:09:18.620
clothes smell this way mmm smells like clean clothes miss thank you all for

03:09:18.620 --> 03:09:21.620
listening to and supporting orange launch radio we do appreciate it it's

03:09:21.620 --> 03:09:27.140
That's very nice of you.

03:09:27.140 --> 03:09:29.060
I think we're pretty much done.

03:09:29.060 --> 03:09:32.340
Jamie, do you have anything you want to say?

03:09:32.340 --> 03:09:33.380
Get your ass over here.

03:09:37.380 --> 03:09:40.260
Who needs potpourri when you can have clean laundry?

03:09:43.180 --> 03:09:44.140
What a lovely thought.

03:09:44.140 --> 03:09:53.380
What do you mean you sprinkled detergent all over the house?

03:09:53.380 --> 03:10:04.380
No, you want to know get away the clean clothes, or not really clean clothes, but give the

03:10:04.380 --> 03:10:07.380
impression of clean clothes, rub a dryer sheet on yourself.

03:10:07.380 --> 03:10:11.540
That's so ghetto. That's like something you'd hear on.

03:10:11.540 --> 03:10:12.540
What?

03:10:12.540 --> 03:10:13.540
of the union.

03:10:13.540 --> 03:10:14.540
Do you smell my butt?

03:10:14.540 --> 03:10:15.540
Rob just smelled my butt.

03:10:15.540 --> 03:10:16.540
I smelled your butt.

03:10:16.540 --> 03:10:17.540
It smells April fresh.

03:10:17.540 --> 03:10:18.540
That was beautiful.

03:10:18.540 --> 03:10:35.860
Okay, sex, blood, and violence, and bloodshed.

03:10:35.860 --> 03:10:42.100
Well there's this movie, Ichi the Killer, where this guy beats up this prostitute and

03:10:42.100 --> 03:10:46.540
and they cut off her nipples, as I mentioned earlier, and there's lots of blood from that.

03:10:46.540 --> 03:10:52.140
So that has sex, you know, violence and blood. What a lovely thought, thank you. It's a great

03:10:52.140 --> 03:10:59.180
movie, though. No, the other thing with the same prostitute, or different prostitute,

03:10:59.180 --> 03:11:10.100
actually, gets her leg cut off and she's hobbling on one foot. Yeah, it's funny. Yeah, funny.

03:11:10.100 --> 03:11:15.860
Okay. I think we're done. I'll be nicer when you're smarter.

03:11:15.860 --> 03:11:19.180
Good night everybody. Thank you for supporting Orange Lounge Radio. We appreciate it. After

03:11:19.180 --> 03:11:24.820
the show tonight, we have for you guys a dance mania marathon. Yay. Whole bunch of thrown

03:11:24.820 --> 03:11:29.020
together tracks from your favorite dance mania albums. That should be exciting. There's whole

03:11:29.020 --> 03:11:34.220
bunches of albums in here. I'm sure you guys will enjoy it. Oh, I have to add one more.

03:11:34.220 --> 03:11:39.100
I want to make sure EX4 gets in here too. So, Loki, say something else while I get this

03:11:39.100 --> 03:11:44.100
If you give me money, I will invite you over to play in the arcade cabinet, because it will be sweet.

03:11:44.100 --> 03:11:48.100
But no one has given me money except for Vandalous.

03:11:48.100 --> 03:11:51.100
And Vandalous, you're more than welcome to come over when I'm done.

03:11:51.100 --> 03:11:55.100
Yeah, but he gave me ten dollars.

03:11:55.100 --> 03:12:02.100
That's alright. Well, you're more than welcome to come over, you're always...

03:12:02.100 --> 03:12:04.100
Whoo! Court! Ah!

03:12:04.100 --> 03:12:06.100
Change.

03:12:06.100 --> 03:12:10.100
Yeah, but she just did laundry here, so that's more like a laundromat.

03:12:10.100 --> 03:12:13.100
Oh yeah. Yeah.

03:12:13.100 --> 03:12:21.100
I'm going to use it as a piggy bank also. It's a $60 piggy bank. Stupid fucking coin door costs that much.

03:12:21.100 --> 03:12:28.100
But, um, yeah, it will be sweet. And I'm thinking because, you know, it'll be nice and tall,

03:12:28.100 --> 03:12:32.100
and I want to put it where this chair is that Jamie sits all the time in.

03:12:32.100 --> 03:12:36.260
I want to put it right there because it'd be out of the way, but then we'd need to move

03:12:36.260 --> 03:12:40.780
the chair, get rid of the chair, and then she'd have to come in the view of the webcam.

03:12:40.780 --> 03:12:46.860
Okay, we're going to do a Dance Mania marathon now. If you missed any portion of tonight's

03:12:46.860 --> 03:12:51.820

03:13:00.300 --> 03:13:05.460
fart continuously on the mic on Wednesday night Wednesday might just be

03:13:05.460 --> 03:13:09.980
a lie if we can't get zero to commit to a show we might just do a live trivial

03:13:09.980 --> 03:13:16.380
pursuit game on air I know we should call the show what I set myself on fire

03:13:16.380 --> 03:13:19.900

In the summertime, in the summertime, I'll be fine every night.

Everybody is mine, but we only get proud.

03:23:47.020 --> 03:23:50.020
When the sun will shine, and they'll be pretty nice.

03:23:50.020 --> 03:23:54.020
Makes me feel so fine, with the readings of light.

03:23:54.020 --> 03:23:57.020
The moon in the shadows, the sun in the stars.

03:23:57.020 --> 03:24:00.520
Everybody gets ready for all of your crimes

03:24:00.520 --> 03:24:03.520
No, never, baby, my time

03:24:03.520 --> 03:24:05.520
There's nothing to do this freedom

03:24:05.520 --> 03:24:07.520
And heaven can die

03:24:07.520 --> 03:24:09.520

Everybody is fine, it's the only big cloud When the sun will shine, and it'll be through the night

03:26:06.920 --> 03:26:13.920
Makes me feel so fine, it's the rhythm of life In the moonlight shadows, the sun is bright

Everybody gets ready for only big clouds No, never, baby, it's the final time
