Don't even get a lousy copy of our home game.
You're a complete loser.
Don't know what I was thinking of.
I guess I just wasn't too bright.
Well, I sure hope I do better.
Next weekend on The Price is Right.
I lost on Jeopardy.
I lost on Jeopardy!

Toto, I think we're not in Kansas anymore.
You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
Mamani Talk, and then some.
Uh, mostly the, and then some, part of that.
Orange Lounge Radio is created by a bunch of potty-mouthed adults.
Orange Lounge may contain sexual, perverted, and mildly retarded content.
You probably shouldn't let your children listen to Orange Lounge Radio.
Yes, I will spank your child.
If you're not going to do your job, goddammit, I will.
Well, here's to my big opening.
A sphincter says what?
I'm super, thanks for asking.
Oh, you little bitch troll from hell.
What am I doing here?
Dodge this.
Look, you stupid bastard, you've got no arms left.
Yes, I have.
Look, there's a flesh wound.
Searching for a boy in high school is as useless as searching for meaning in a Pauly Shore movie.
Oh, yeah?
Well, I hope your babies look like monkeys.
DarkSakura.
I've had a sniff.
Skye.
But I'm playing it for the bartender, so suffer.
Loki.
I hate you.
Orange Lounge Radio.
Nice.
We are live, and this is episode number .59 for September the 7th of 2003.
I made a .59 joke.
Nerd.
You're tuned into the Be Money Scene's most glompy radio station of all things Be Money.
My name is Rob Roberts, but you might know me as Sky.
Joining me, as always, are my awesome co-hosts.
In this corner, the happiest bunny on the farm is Jamie Summers.
I want to nap.
You know her better as DarkSakura.
Or today, it's NappySakura.
She needs to take a nap.
What?
It's BabySakura.
I'm going to kick your ass in a moment.
I'll be contagious if you watch.
It's AngryBabySakura.
In that corner, say hello to our TechMassa, Loki.
Hello.
Hello.
Also with us tonight we have... Air.
Nobody!
No, we have air.
We have air.
We have particles.
See, if I'd had that song chewed up, I could have played air and made another funny Bomani joke, like two jokes in 60 seconds.
We have germs and other single-celled organisms.
We are not alone here.
And a fart of mine in the back of the room.
And by making those two Bomani jokes in a row, you would have qualified for the quota for us to kill you.
I'm so excited.
I have a blunt object somewhere around here I could beat you with.
You have the microphone.
Where's the ferret?
You know what?
One of them's... I think... I think they're missing.
I honestly... And I didn't kill them, I swear.
I think they're missing.
They're around here somewhere.
They gotta be.
We'll have to go on a ferret hunt later.
You're gonna hunt to save it, and I'm gonna hunt to kill it.
I'll just make you smell my shoe.
Um...
We'll be back.
We're a little dead tonight, so it's going to be an interesting show.
DarkSakura's kind of feeling a little under the weather, I think.
Hooray for upper respiratory infections.
Hooray for ear infections.
Oh, that perked her right up.
Does that mean the cure for the common cold is a nice, friendly ferret?
I am happy and full of spirit.
Loki, you are evil.
I'm feeling kind of, I'm feeling tired too.
I've done nothing but really nap, like all week long.
I love that sound.
That makes me go squee.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Thanks for watching!
Thanks for watching!
Thanks for watching!

This randomness could only be brought to you by Orange Lounge Hello everybody and welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio In that sense you heard .59 appropriate because this is the 59th show of Orange Lounge Radio And Yamato with 2002 Does that mean we're heavenly?
This show is heavenly.
Ha ha.
Except we're all going to hell.
I made a joke.
Ha ha.
Yay.
Tengoku joke.
Ha ha.
And I was going to make it an all numbers set, but Jamie really wanted to hear Ninzaburro and that didn't sound like such a bad idea, so you had a couple numbered songs and then Ninzaburro.
Ninzaburro's cool.
Yeah, I'm still trying to find episodes of the show.
It sounded a little fast to you, huh?
Yeah.
And especially in 4th Mix, like, remember how fast Dropout seemed in 4th Mix?
Because Dropout was like the max 300 of its time, right?
It was just like, oh my god, the arrows are coming up so fast.
When you go and you play Dropout on Max 2 or something, you're like, oh, this is easy.
Dropout's easy.
And it's weird how much that frame rate totally changed things.
So I think that's why Ninzaburro maybe... Well, then again, of course, that goes reverse my philosophy because then Ninzaburro would have played faster.
I don't know.
Well, I guess it depends if you played it on 4th or 5th mix because 5th mix is when the frame rate started to change.
I don't know.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
The beginning of the week was okay.
Well, I think it was really good because that's when Marin Chan and Rick were here.
Oh, yes.
And had a very good time.
The air conditioner went out, though, on Sunday night, or during the day on Sunday, and it was out Monday, and it was out Tuesday, and it was out Wednesday.
And it was really hot on Wednesday.
I went to work, and I was feeling just wretched.
But I made it through my day of work.
I mean, sorry, Tuesday.
I went back to work and I was feeling really crappy.
And I went to work Wednesday and was feeling even worse.
And then when I went into work Thursday, I don't remember the entire drive to work.
And that's not a good sign.
You didn't fall asleep during the drive, did you?
I don't know.
I don't remember.
and, um, I was having bad dizzy spells and finally I just, you know, asked, I asked if I could go home.
I was not feeling good at all.
I was running a fever and, um, I was feel, I, I remember driving home but I had dizzy spells on the way home which, you know, good thing there was light traffic.
Um, so I, I got home and scheduled my, and, and everyone knows me, I don't go to the doctor unless I have to and I scheduled myself an appointment for the doctor that night and, uh,
Turns out that I have a respiratory infection and an ear infection in my right ear.
I am no longer contagious, which is good for you guys.
That's a very good sign, thank you.
Because I've been on antibiotics now all weekend.
I'm going to be on antibiotics for the rest of the week and after that.
How about getting off of these antibiotics?
I am on this stuff that I have to put up my nose and squirt and it burns.
It smells like burning.
And, um... And I'm on my inhaler again for Abuderal, which I was supposed to get six refills of it, and I only got, like, zero.
So I'm going to have to make sure that it wasn't my doctor's, you know, doctor handwriting, which is basic doctor handwriting.
Um... I, uh... I was feeling a lot better, though, on Friday after sleeping for about 15 hours.
And, uh...
and did my thing that day.
Yesterday, though, I got up at the butt cracker dawn, which is about 10 in the morning for me, and made it over to Iguana Girl's house and a bunch of us all went to see Weird Al in Madeira.
How's Moo doing?
Moo is so cute.
Moo's got a big belly.
Moo is Iguana Girl's iguana.
We also have a regular chatter named Moo, and we have a Mooheimer.
This is Moo the Cute.
There's lots of Moos.
Moo the Cute Iguana.
And Moo was being antsy all day.
Moo was being a little butt, but that's okay because Moo is cute.
And Melody came with us, which was really awesome.
DarkSakura.com
Because there was like happy everywhere.
It looks like happy.
Well, certainly this week anyway.
Did you hear about what happened at Disneyland?
That's pretty damn funny.
And we were talking about it too on the trip.
We were talking about it on the trip and we think it's just because the guy was doing something stupid.
Because he was up in the front and we think he was trying to get into the train.
Like he was trying to jump from the train into another one or something?
No, trying to get into the front part.
Oh.
I still think it's that guy's fault.
Let's just blame it on that guy.
It's a little kid who threw gum on a track or something like that.
Even better, let's blame it on a little kid.
Stupid children.
That child is a murderer and should be hung.
Anyway, um...
Back to... Whoa, you know, that's kind of neat in the chatroom.
It looks like a little curvy.
It looks like a big nose, like Mario's nose or something.
What?
I was looking at the curve that the text took in the chatroom.
It was kind of neat looking.
Anyway, um... Okay.
Jamie's going crazy.
Fuck you.
Jamie's taking a little too many meds.
Bomber ferret.
You see this?
It's mine now.
Give me a ferret!
It's mine.
Give me a ferret!
You have a ferret.
I have my own favorite.
Tell your story.
We all sat in our seats and everything and had to go find Julie and Krista and Becky and all them who weren't going to meet us there.
People you don't know.
Listeners of Orange Ones Radio.
Julie's been in the chat room before.
Oh, that's true.
That's right.
That's right.
She has.
My bad.
Anyway, Weird Al was awesome and fabulous and there were these stupid fuckers around us smoking, them getting to that later.
I had they die.
Smoking crack or what?
And then there were these sluts in the row in front of us, I swear.
They were like trying to out-hoochie each other.
Wait, sluts don't listen to Weird Al.
No, no, they were in the front row and they were being sluts.
They were all trying to out-slut each other.
Trying to be like super skank and everything and he was making fun of them the whole show.
It was great.
And, uh, and he was, but because he went to see one of the sluts that was in front of us to make fun of her, you know, during, uh, uh, the, uh, what is the song called?
The, uh, the one where he's going through all of the, the pickup lines?
I don't know.
I don't listen to enough Weird Al.
I like Weird Al, but I don't follow him enough.
He was right in front of us, so I got a good look at him and everything.
I took a picture of the back of his head during one more minute.
So wait, you guys were in the second row?
Well, there was the priority seating in front of us that was about six.
Rose are all blocked off.
But he came into our area, too, to make fun of the sluts, I guess.
He went way back in the whole paid seating area.
It was great.
That's cool.
So pay for your tickets when you go to the fair.
You'll get good seats.
Loki, they went to Fresno at the Madera County Fair.
But today was Great America.
I'm surprised you didn't go.
Because it's $40.
Not you, Loki. $50.
I was going to go, but that was supposed to be for my birthday.
But yeah, no one took me.
I didn't know you wanted to go.
I would have taken him to... I had this planned for a month and a half.
I know.
But...
You guys all piled in a van, right?
Yeah, Vandalist took us in his van, his SUV.
It was a comfy SUV, too, and I sort of slept on the way back.
But it was a really fun time, and it was funny watching the skanks try to out-skank each other.
This one girl decided that she had to dance every time.
She was like, sit your stupid skinny butt down, you're ugly.
Did you say she was ugly?
No, we just were like, Hey, down in front!
And she's like, Oh, I'm sorry, I'm stupid.
And sat down.
But he did... He changed the Yoda chant.
Well, not really changed it, but more like expanded it.
It was pretty cool.
And for those that don't know what the Yoda chant is?
I don't remember how to do the whole Yoda chant.
If you've been to a Weird Al show, you know the Yoda chant.
He did...
He did that stupid... He did the stinky song that was making fun of that stupid person Nelly.
Oh, yeah.
That guy I hate.
It's getting hot in here, so take off all your clothes.
Yeah, I know that one.
They put a bunch of trash cans on the stage.
It was great.
And they did All About the Pentiums.
And did, of course, One More Minute.
Is it just me or is Weird Al getting old?
Shut up.
Shut up.
Is he, is he, he's got a baby.
I know, well he didn't have the baby.
Well his wife had the baby.
But still like I saw him in an interview recently and I'm like, weird how he's getting old.
It was weird.
You're getting old too.
I know, we're all getting old, but he's getting like really old.
I still kind of look like my yearbook picture.
He doesn't look very old at all.
He did the funniest, he did some of his parody interviews.
Uh-huh.
He did, um... I'm moving out in the living room so people can see me on webcam if they want.
He did one with, uh, with Justin Timberlake and Brittany on the TV.
It was great.
Justin Timberlake is such a suck.
The best one was the Celine Dion one.
Oh, shit.
He's like, well, I know when you were a child you had this traumatic experience where you're going skiing and your whole family was eaten by cannibals.
He's like, yes, I remember the smell of my mother cooking.
He's like, I bet it was horrible for you.
No, it was fun.
And the Avril Lavigne one.
He's like, say something incoherently for us.
Well, I don't think, you know, she's going off on something.
It was really great.
And it was, the interviews were great.
You know, this is actually, I think the one tonight is his last show of the tour.
Oh, yeah.
So all you people missed out.
Here's Jamie's chance to rub it in.
With a ferret.
So, Weird Al, skanks, good songs, good time.
I have pictures, and I took pictures of the fireworks.
Tell me about where you guys went to eat, because this is a funny story.
We ate at IHOP.
I told you about IHOP.
You told me about it.
Did you tell them?
I said it's the happiest place on Earth.
I said it's the only thing.
But you didn't let me finish.
and I hope it was the happiest place on earth because it looked like happy up and threw up all over it.
It's like happy decided to pop and go, oh, I'm happy, happy, puke.
And the whole place was covered in happy faces.
So it looked like a Walmart.
Yeah.
Walmart is not a happy place to sleep.
It made Walmart look like the sewer.
The rat-infested sewer that it is.
With skanks.
I'll talk about that later, much later.
I have issues with Walmart this week.
But it was too happy.
And then today, we got home at like 3.30, long enough for me to do a little post-lit in my live journal.
And then I passed out and was dead for...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Smiley face.
And it had pumpkin syrup.
Oh, it was so good.
So today?
Oh, pumpkin.
Today, I felt like shit.
I felt like shit when I went home because I'm still sick and I shouldn't have gone.
And I had to go along the livestock.
But I got to shoot a man yesterday.
Oh, yeah.
You shot a guy like 33 times?
They had a paintball thing.
And I was shooting little targets.
I shot a bunny in the head.
And I shot a teddy bear in the ass.
I was shooting all the small targets and then I decided to use my last 20 or so shots on the man himself who was just standing there all padded up.
I got him in the head.
And it was a real guy?
Real guy.
All bundled up in paintball gear.
I shot him in the head.
I shot him in his heart.
I shot him in his groin.
I shot him in the right kneecap enough to make him back up a step.
And then I shot him a bunch of other places and I think I shot him in the eyeball once.
But he was wearing goggles so it wasn't much fun.
Hmm.
I was like, oh, no more?
Wasn't there a little heckler there, too, that was telling you to shut up?
I told him to shut up.
Some stupid little kid.
You can curse on Orange Hawn's radio.
It's okay.
I don't feel like cursing.
I feel like being clean today because I'm sick.
You know I'm sick when I'm talking like a good little girl.
Fuck him.
Stupid little kid, okay?
Stupid little kid.
You can hit it.
Hit the guy.
Hit the guy.
Don't hit the little things.
Hit the guy.
Hit the man.
I'm like, okay.
This was while...
Vandalis is going.
I told the kid, okay, don't talk when I'm shooting or I'll shoot you.
I didn't say that.
I was like, do me a favor, kid, don't talk when I'm shooting.
But it's fine.
I was like, no, it's not.
I would have turned that gun right around and opened fire.
Oh, the thing was so touchy.
I could have had that thing go, die.
It was a very touchy gun.
But we all shot people.
It was good.
I've done that with a water gun, but they only turn so far.
You can't really shoot your neighbor, but you can get a stream going kind of sideways, and you can flick water on your neighbor.
I could have pulled this thing completely out and gone on a murderous paintball rampage.
Why would you?
Because there weren't enough children around.
Just that one kid, and he wasn't worth me wasting the ammo I paid for.
So, um...
It was a good time, and today I felt really, really crappy.
I took a picture of a cow that was acting like a cat, hunched down like Shermie does, turning around and licking his shoulder.
When Licklick, I'm cute, I think I'm a cat, but I'm really a cow, boo.
And we came up with retarded animal sounds.
Moo!
Moo!
I think that was... Okay.
We were in the IHOP going, yay, and then talking about animals.
Somebody was saying earlier in the chat room that Weird Al should be in Bomani.
No.
No, I don't think so either.
I don't want Bomani to ruin Weird Al.
But Weird Al should do a parody of a Bomani song.
No.
I think he should.
He'd make, like, Love Me Do the Polka.
That would be great, a Bomani polka.
Come on.
Tell me that would not be beautiful.
I don't think he'd do it.
I, I, I, I'm your little butterfly
and Melody took a nap with Shermie.
Aww.
And I bummed around online and then she went home but she's coming back because her laptop's at my house.
So we'll have a special surprise visit from Shark Skrull in a little while.
Surprise!
Surprise!
So I might have to leave a bit early but I'm doing other things here too.
Um, yeah, my clothes are visiting, too.
Yes, LankyStyle has it.
He says, Superstar Pokestyle.
No!
No.
My name is Chaos.
I'm here to do it.
That earned you a fap in the head by the ferret.
Did you say a fap in the head?
I said a fap.
I thought she said a fap.
Don't expect much out of me, but whining and angst
You get wine with your eggs today.
What do we expect from you usually?
Shut up.
Me to be funny and excited and bouncing and cute.
And you know what?
On top of that, I was so happy.
I mean, my purse, my little purse is dead, which pissed me off.
So I was going to use my bunny, my bunny backpack.
My bunny backpack broke.
Oh, no.
So now I have it rigged because it's the only thing I have.
I have to go buy a new purse.
I don't have any money.
And I have to put it on the credit card probably because I need a purse.
And Matt's humping the chair.
He's fapping the chair.
You're fapping the chair.
You were faced the other way.
Oh, John Fields suggests a bye-bye baby balloon polka.
A polka polka.
Yes.
I don't have energy.
Stand up.
No, no, nobody's love.
Stand up.
Stand up.
Why?
Stand up.
I don't want to stand up.
Stand up.
No.
Stand up.
I'm standing up.
Ow.
No polka.
I only want polka.
I want a joga polka.
Come on.
I want trance polka.
The beauty of silence polka.
The beauty of polka.
That's a remix you should do.
I'm sorry, I don't make crap.
Is T-Dog listening?
Maybe he could make Beauty and Polka.
Don't put it past him.
That's my new name, T-Dog.
What, for the four-letter word?
Yeah.
Mute!
Anyway.
Hi, Newt!
Is that all you have to say about your day and your week?
I think I have a fever again.
I have to go to work tomorrow.
You don't have to.
Yes, I do.
Unless you want to get fired.
I have a doctor's excuse though, so nah.
And I'm on lots of drugs.
I have to snort liquid cocaine.
Cool.
I don't know, it's called Nazarel.
It's like burns.
It's like inhaling snot, but on fire.
It's really disgusting.
Ferb is criticizing my pronunciation of Dom Dariam.
It's Dom Dariram.
Dom Dariram?
Dom Dariam?
How about Dom Dariam?
No.
Dariam.
I like Dariam because it sounds like Darier.
It's a stupid yoga song.
Stupid yoga song.
From now on... You know what?
I don't care if my pronunciation of Dom Dariam was a little odd and wrong because the British say everything odd.
So, you know what?
Shut up!
That's mean.
I'm just kidding.
Someone kick Rob.
You're closer.
Kick Rob for me.
No.
Okay.
Anyway, let's go on to Loki.
If you're done talking about your weekend.
I'm going to go tickle my laundry.
Okay.
I think your wash is done because I don't hear it spinning anymore.
In the meantime, we'll talk to Loki.
Loki, how was your weekend?
It was all right.
I didn't do anything.
Sat there.
Rodding away at work.
I won spinners tonight.
Those are going to be for my Beatmania controller.
And what is a spinner?
It's exactly that.
It spins.
It's a little controller.
Like a top?
Like a knob.
It spins like a knob.
You bought a knob.
Two knobs.
Anyways, so I bought those and then pretty much worked on my pads a little bit
Have all the metal bent on them now.
And made a remix, did some show.
Yes, we have a new Loki remix coming soon.
Tonight, at some point, yes?
I already finished it.
I finished it during the show.
Maybe next break then.
Maybe.
Maybe.
Alright.
I dedicated it to the Thunder Mountain Railroad train that crashed.
Okay.
So we have the whatever song it's going to be, Big Thunder Mountain Mix, or what is this?
I like that one better.
I want to change it.
It was just going to be called Derailed Mix, but I like the Big Thunder Mountain Mix.
How many of your remixes have I named?
Okay.
This is at least the second or third one.
I named another one.
There was another one I named.
It was the Matrix one.
Gravity Reloaded.
Eh.
Yeah, uh-huh.
I rule.
You just don't want to admit it.
Whatever.
I have money, I have to go buy the... I was shopping for a computer today for my MAME cabinet and then that was expensive so I didn't buy it.
And then I was going to shop for parts online for the MAME cabinet.
That was also expensive so I didn't buy it.
And so pretty much it's just pricing stuff right now and working on it and that kind of thing.
But anyways... Mikey Style says a spinner is a short, thin girl.
Loki buying that online?
Never.
And two of them.
No, but, um... No, Loki was talking about how he bought spinners online, and LankyStyle says, a spinner is a short, thin girl.
Because you can spin her in your lap when she's riding your cock.
Anyways... You don't have a cock!
No, but, uh... I resent that...
Because one day I'm going to invent the one that, like, women can have that... I don't... Okay.
My friend... They already have cocks for women.
The vagina cock?
No.
I have... Well, she's not really a friend, I guess, anymore, but this girl that I know who's really irresponsible and is kind of stupid, she said she wanted a dick so that she could whip it out and piss on people.
All right, we know what happens when people wish for dicks, okay?
We've already watched that movie.
I haven't.
You know what, though?
Having a dick, it isn't all that.
Because when you get a dick, yes, when you get a dick, you get balls as well.
And people can kick you there.
And imagine, like, your entire three days.
I've often said it's much better to be a woman.
Imagine your whole three days' worth of cramps piled into five seconds of intense pain.
That's what being kicked in the balls feels like.
Yeah, but the five seconds goes away.
And you have no idea what cramps feel like.
Imagine having pain that makes you puke.
Somebody once told me what having a baby felt like.
It's like pulling your lower lip over your head.
That's what somebody told me once.
It's like a family guy freaking loser.
There was a movie that described it as trying to push something the size of a watermelon out of a hole the size of a pea.
I think it was a lemon.
A lemon, yeah.
That was Chase and Amy.
Giving birth sucks and I'm never going to do it.
That's why they cut open your stomach and pull the damn kid out.
It's just like, what the hell's the point?
It's like trying to shove a piano through a door when there's a perfectly good window right there.
I mean, I don't see the point.
And that's why men will never have babies.
The genius of Loki on Orange Lounge Radio.
You know what?
Thank you for watching!
Yeah, because she has something wrong with her pituitary gland or something like that.
It's causing her cells, and I quote, went crazy.
And so they're like, that affects how much your blood's produced and like other crap like that.
So they have to operate or possibly treat in medication.
Ouch.
Sure it is.
How is that funny?
I don't know.
It's not life-threatening, so it's not bad.
I would imagine having someone operate on your brain itself is life-threatening.
Would you like... Oh, hi!
We're going to open your head and poke with your brain.
It doesn't hurt.
It kind of tickles.
And you've had brain surgery.
That would explain it.
That would explain a few things.
No.
Yeah, so not much going on other than my birthday this week, but, you know... Happy birthday!
Yeah, it hasn't occurred yet.
9-11 is when my birthday is.
I'm thinking in advance because I might be over here.
I went ahead and we kind of had a little party for me on Saturday because my mom is going to be out of town for both my birthday and my sister's birthday.
It kind of lumped us all together and did all that kind of thing.
Happy collective birthday.
Yes, and so that was kind of cool.
And then I don't know what's going on this week.
I'm supposed to go out to dinner with my girlfriend on Thursday.
And yeah, that's about it.
My turn.
My week was kind of shitty because I was, like Jamie, I was sick.
I didn't have quite the multiple layers of infection that she had in the end.
Oh yeah, I had a sinus infection too.
And they tested me for strep throat, but I don't have it.
I was just feeling like shit, and it wasn't to the point where I'm like, I gotta go to a doctor.
Because I just went to the doctor a couple weeks ago for something else, and after that whole experience I didn't want to go back for a while.
So, um...
I just kind of slept it off.
Like, literally, I went to work, I would come home, nap, wake up for an hour, and go to bed.
Like, that was my week, pretty much.
It sucked.
And then I had this huge thing on my arm.
Like, I don't know if it's a zit or what, but I saw one of my exes on Thursday who I hadn't seen in quite a while.
And, of course, he's got one of those sarcastic kinds of humor.
And no, it is not AIDS.
He said it looks like I do drugs.
It totally does.
So now I'm kind of like, oh, cool, I can go around and show people at work.
Like, people at work probably think I do drugs.
That's pretty cool.
But then I show my mother, and she's like, you've got a burn!
It's an infected blood vessel, and you're going to die if you don't go to the doctor and get it taken care of.
Have you tried Lansing yet?
Well, I can't, but it's going down.
So why make a big deal out of it if it's going down?
Well, make sure that you take Benadryl.
Benadryl.
Take it before bed in case I'll knock your ass out.
That's what I've been living on is Benadryl at night.
That's my anti-drug.
My mother also told me something very scary yesterday that made me kind of want to hit her.
What?
She said, I'm so in love with Cher that I think I'm a lesbian.
And then she laughed.
And I was like, don't you ever say that again.
That's alarming.
That is very alarming.
I can't really, you know, I wouldn't say it's too much lesbianism there, because she is quite man-ish.
Cher, that is.
She sounds like a, she sings like a horse.
That was pretty much my response, but anyway.
She does sound like a horse.
Well, actually, for those of you who wonder, Cher was actually doing a concert in Sacramento last night.
It was her farewell tour.
Second time she's been here, by the way, on the farewell tour.
We went the first time, so we didn't see the need to go the second time.
I know why she's doing a farewell tour, because she's running out of things to do plastic surgery on.
Seriously.
But the second time...
I love Cher, I love her so much I watch the concert every time it comes on NBC
I did not do that.
I know.
So I decided to go out last night because I'm feeling better.
So I went out with my buddy Matt.
I was supposed to go to some barbecue with Irene and Brad, but they never called me, so...
I went out with Matt instead.
Well, we went to the Streets of London, which is a little pub downtown.
And we went to this place and I ate this huge plate of... Streets of London has the best fish and chips.
Well, I didn't have that.
I had a big plate of fries covered in cheese and bacon.
Mmm, fat.
Yes, chips.
Sorry.
Chips, cheese, and bacon.
My bad.
Stupid British slang.
I'm just trying to see if I can get Ferb pissed off at me.
Anyway... So we went there, and I actually drank beer, but it was Guinness, so I'm forgiven.
If it was Guinness, it's beautiful.
and this is the drink of the gods after that we went over to the depot because it was kind of late we didn't really want to go like dancing dancing so we went over to the depot which is a gay bar in Sacramento me and my friend Matt the ice princess been on the show before we went over there and then we met like a whole bunch of other people there we met two people he knew from online and we met Phoenix also Corey you may or may not have met him I don't know if you have before or not
and then our other friend Joshy who's leaving town.
We just had a good old time.
We were partying it up.
And this is the funny thing.
It was the Cher concert after party.
So they started playing just like non-stop Cher stuff and we're like, okay, we have to go.
And we went to this new burger joint they opened up next door.
It's a brand new burger joint.
It's a gay burger joint in the gay district of Sacramento.
It's called Hot Rods.
I didn't get to play pinball at the depot last night, though.
That made me sad.
There was actually people on them, like, all night.
But they have pinball at the depot.
Was there good food, though, at the Hot Rods?
At Hot Rods, actually, the fries are damn good.
It's a lot like In-N-Out, the place.
Do they have wine beef?
But they have more.
They have garden burgers, if you want them.
They have turkey burgers, if you want them.
They have the hot dogs, if you're into that.
Chicken strips, whatever.
They have, like, way bigger menu.
Some people like hot dogs.
Some people like Polish dogs.
Okay.
That was... I'm not Chinese, so I don't eat dog.
What'd you say, Loki?
I said... Yeah, well, I'm not... Wait, no, I don't know if it's Chinese that eats... I can't remember.
Hello?
See, I can't reach the ferret.
Come in!
Oh!
Sharks Girl's here.
Not by choice.
Speak to our people.
Well, Sharks Girl, why don't you tell us.
We're all sitting around doing how was your week, how was your day.
Why don't you tell us how was your week and how was your day.
Week sucked.
Yesterday was good, today was good until about what, 6 p.m.?
Then it has sucked balls from there on out.
And I want to say for the record, Folsom sucks and has no cell phone reception.
I get cell phone reception in my house.
I've dropped like...
Four times since I got off the 50.
Ouch.
Sorry.
Okay.
Well, we're going to take a quick break and get back on track.
We have a lot of Imani news we want to talk about here.
Is there a track?
Yeah, there's a track.
We have a laugh track.
Not at Disneyland.
Okay.
Rob's going to hell.
We're going to kick off this break with a brand new Loki remix.
Loki, would you like to tell us about your mix?
I gotta change the name on it.
Oh, he's gotta change the name on it.
But while you're changing the name, tell us something about the mix.
Um, it's cool and stuff.
No, I don't know.
It was just, um, I needed something to mix together and this just kind of worked for some reason.
So, yeah.
It's, um, Stoic, the Big Thunder Mountain Mix.
Alright, this is Loki's brand newest remix.
This is Stoic, the Big Thunder Mountain Mix.
The brandest new?
The brandest newest.
Not just brandest new, the brandest newest.
Here it is, Stoic, the Big Thunder Mountain Mix, here on Orange Lounge Radio.
Hey, I like that.
That was pretty cool.
That was Stoic, the Big Thunder Mountain mix.
That was kind of neat.
I have to agree with the chat room.
It kind of sounded a little bit like porn.
But it definitely choo-chooed along there.
I like that.
For once, he didn't use gravity.
Let's give him a hand for staying away from gravity.
Now you've got to do one that's not tack.
I don't know if you can do it.
But I like the little bits-a-holic there at the end, too.
That was kind of cool.
That was nice.
I like that.
Good job.
Anybody want to say something about it?
Oh.
Okay, I think we'll go back to break, because we've got other people doing other errands or whatever.
We're going to play some more songs, and we'll be back.
Thank you for watching!
Thanks for watching!
Listen to Orange Lounge Radio.
Because Bongo demands it.
Hello and welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio.
And Tomorrow Perfume we heard in that break, which is kind of part of the Bomani news we've been hearing about this week.
Is that a remedy to today's stink?
Or as our resident comedian, Lanky Style, says in the chat room, Have you heard the new DJ Taka song sampled for 2DX 10th Style?
It's called Yesterday Cologne.
I like today's stink.
That sounds like something I would have read on Moondabor's blog.
I like today's musk.
I guess something to do with the demo disc.
You hack the disc and you see a master list of songs.
And in that list of songs, we saw Tomorrow Perfume, which indicates Tomorrow Perfume will be an unlock in Max 2 USA.
Or not.
Or not.
Or not.
It may be, because what happens is, and as this was explained by this guy on the boards called DancerX, he explained that with every new home release, there's an updated master list of every single song that's ever been in DDR, pretty much.
Or, so to say, everything that's pretty much in that...
version of the DDR engine or whatever.
So in this case, we're going to have, with this list, it's pretty much both what's going to be in Dancing Stage Fever and what's going to be in Max 2 USA, because they both use the same engine, so it's hard to determine what's going to be in what.
But that was one of the songs that was mentioned in there, along with More Deep from, I think, isn't that 2DX6 style or something like that?
Yeah, that's going to be in there.
But those are some of the ones that are supposed to be in there.
There's another one, one of the ones that kind of grabbed people's attention was, and it's a really odd name, it's called Max and then there's a period after it.
So I guess either it's just like Max or Max period.
Was Max Unlimited also in the list?
Legend of Max, Paranoia, Survivor Max
Now, because of this hacking of the disc, they've kind of had to go and reveal some things, some more things about DDR Max 2 USA.
And I've always kind of hated this, I know something you don't know business about Max 2.
I mean, I understand the desire to create like, I don't know what you'd call it, like people wanted to drool.
Superiority?
Surprise, not superiority, just wanting to surprise people or whatever, wanting to tease things and stuff like that.
But you know,
The Guessing Games and all that garbage.
Sometimes it kind of makes me wish they'd stay out of it.
You know what I mean?
I don't know.
I just don't like the whole fact that there's this whole I-know-something-you-don't-know attitude about a lot of this stuff.
And it just makes me bitter.
Anyway, here's what we do know.
Here's what we've been told.
When they hacked the disc, they tried to bring up the song samples, because if you remember when the Max 1 disc was hacked, they were able to get song samples, and that's how they found that there was a Drop the Bomb remix on there, is that somebody hacked out the sound sample from the demo disc.
Well, they got smarter this time, and none of those samples are in there.
It just had the four samples of the songs, but it had a Midnight Blaze remix in there, which has been revealed to be the information screen music.
Whoop-a-doo!
And, for those who don't know, it's probably the same damn remix that was on the V-Rare CD with Max, too.
Ooh, don't care.
Whoop-a-doo!
Um...
Feelings Won't Fade
Max 2 US has a color-coded song system, meaning that kind of like how Max 2 Japan, you had all these different colors of songs in there.
You had, you know, the new songs were one color, the old songs were another color, the Oni remixes were another color.
They're going to do that as well with this.
And so default songs are green that are new to the US, 27 of them.
repeats US songs because there was a few of those in there I believe like Shining Polaris is coming back and there's a few others I think Silent Hills one repeats are blue there's 13 repeats unlocks are yellow and there's 20 unlocks pretty good amount challenge step unlocks are purple and there's 7 of them and the special red unlocks there's 2 of them which assumably have been maxed unlimited in Conklin yeah pretty much um
I don't believe that there's not the samples on the disc because they're lazy and stupid and they're going to leave crap like that.
They fuck up every single US mix ever made.
Every single one's been fucked up in some way and lazy in some way.
So I'm going to look myself on this disc to see if I can fight it.
Just because they might not have found it the conventional way doesn't mean it's not still there.
Burning Heat's been confirmed as an unlock.
What else did they confirm?
Oh, yes, that Oni Mode is not in the game.
Oni Mode will not be in the game.
Nonstop, yes.
Oni Mode, no.
I prefer Nonstop.
And in its place, in Oni Mode's place, will be Challenge Mode.
Like the challenge on 4th Mix type stuff?
That's cool.
That's what I heard is going to be the difference.
They're going to have a challenge mode to unlock these things.
And I like that better, to be honest, because I think Onis are retarded.
But that's what they're going to be doing, I guess.
Here's why Onis are retarded, and I'm glad they're staying in the arcade.
Because playing on a homepad, you miss all the fucking time.
It's just part of playing at home.
I don't care if you have Ignition 59.0 or whatever...
Thank you.
So non-stop was a better choice.
But it's just weird that they have, now that explains it, Loki, because I had a question.
How is it that they have the challenge step songs as unlocks when there's no Oni mode?
Or challenge mode, or whatever they're calling it in the U.S.
That makes sense to me, because I'm kind of like, wait a minute, so you're not going to have Oni mode, but you're going to have these Oni unlock songs.
And you're going to have, unless they go back and make basic trick-o-maniac steps, which I doubt they will, they're only going to have one set of steps.
Hopefully, I'll be pleasantly surprised if somebody's gone back and made basic and trick steps.
Because I think we all have accepted that the challenge steps will just be the maniac steps.
They can do it in five minutes.
Loki can do it.
Loki will come make steps for you.
Well, no, what's sad is they have steps for a few songs.
Like, for instance, Hysteria 2001 and Before You Before is a beat mix.
They're both in Euromix, too.
They have their own basic and trick steps for it.
They're just too lazy to put those over into the US mixes.
It's sad.
We think.
We speculate.
To this point.
We won't know for sure until September 24th.
I'm still not making a comment.
Um... I'm still going on record saying I'm supporting whatever Konami's gonna do.
Officially supporting.
I'll have the game.
I don't think there's any doubt that we're going to buy the game.
It'll be the best mix to date, home release to date.
There's no doubt about that.
So we all know that Max USA blew everything else out of the water.
It blew Max Japan out of the water.
I'm sorry.
I don't care what you think about the Japanese.
It was superior in every way to Max Japan.
And Max 2 USA will probably be superior in every way to Max Japan.
But as rabid fans, we're going to bitch about everything that wasn't done the way we wanted it to.
So, that being said, I believe that covers everything that's been confirmed this week for Max 2 USA.
Do we know any more of those songs?
I was trying to find that list of songs that were found in the hacks.
I know one that kind of struck me as interesting was Don't Call Me Baby by Madison Avenue.
Because I haven't seen that announced for either game yet.
So it's an unlock in one of the games.
More than likely probably the European one.
Because I don't think they have as much of the European list to do this one.
So, some of the other ones I think were in there.
I'm trying to look up the list here.
I think Turn the Beat Around was another one, maybe.
Or Saturday Night Fever or something like that.
There was one that was an old school song that I just can't remember which one it was.
There's a bunch of stuff on there.
There's another...
Another Spice Girls song in there, I think.
Oh, goody.
But, you know, that's obviously going to be friggin' European, so... Yay, don't care.
Anyway, that's the big Monty News this week.
So...
I haven't really heard of anything else going on in the Bomani world this week.
Anybody know anything interesting going on otherwise?
Not that I've noticed.
What?
I haven't really noticed anything.
I think that the only activity is going on over here.
What, with Max 2 USA?
Yeah, I think that's really the only thing going on.
Well, we have Extreme in Japan coming out in October, but I think we all kind of know what to expect.
Because the Japanese ones, we always know what to expect because they're going to be just like the arcade ones, pretty much.
It's just the song list is always a question, and what's going to be an unlock, and...
Hopefully Extreme Japan doesn't suck.
There's a lot of people already kind of pushing it and selling it as it's going to be the best home release yet.
It's going to be even better than Max 2 USA.
Personally, I doubt it's going to be better than Max 2 USA.
Extreme just sucked for me.
Even the arcade version.
I mean, sure it had an assload of songs, but not that many new, new, new, new songs.
Just a bunch of recycled shit from other games.
I actually say that Extreme got me back into playing DDR.
I think Extreme scared me away from DDR.
I'm just, I'm not a big fan of Extreme.
I think I'm, honestly, when it all said and done, I think I'm just really bitter at the fact that the Dance Mania tracks were, there was like, what, seven of them licensed and they weren't that great.
There was maybe two good ones out of the whole bunch.
And just... I like it for playing all the old stuff.
Yeah, I don't know, it's just...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
I play Stoic, that's kind of fun to dance to, it has interesting steps that are challenging Now what's weird is I actually have been getting back into DDR more lately I've been playing a little more DDR lately, but it's been any machine I can find really, it's not just extreme I played 4th Plus yesterday, I had a ball, until I almost killed myself Playing too many hard songs, that's what I get for being out of shape by the way
I play a bunch of Catastrophics back to back and I almost have an asthma attack in the middle of the arcade.
But I'll just have to practice more often.
Here's some of the songs that were on there.
Some of the new ones on the list.
Come On Eileen, Groove Is In The Heart, Stayin' Alive, that was the one.
I was thinking of staying alive, get down tonight.
Then they have, of course, Take Me Away.
That's one of the ones.
A Stupid Barber, Teenage Kicks, Scorching Moon, A Little Bit of Ecstasy, All That She Wants.
That's the end of the baseball.
Yeah, Ace of Base, of course, Heaven, Cool for Cats, Jump Around, One Step Beyond, The Boys Are Back in Town, 2020 Vision, Dizzy, Virtuality, Music, the Bowstick Remix, which is by Darude, and then, of course, Busy Child and Feelings Won't Fade.
Those are the new licensed songs.
Bad Routine was another one that was in there, and More Deep version .21 or whatever.
I want someone to do a Routine to Bad Routine.
Oh, yeah.
and Keep On Lifting from last time.
Remember how I said Keep On Lifting?
Yeah, yeah.
No Nemesis makes me sad.
Yeah, no Nemesis.
What happened there?
Nemesis would be kind of... It's not a dance song.
I'm sorry.
Whoever cut that, it was a good idea.
I hope they put something else in its place.
Max, period.
Who knows?
I think it's just something to screw with people.
I think it's just something to screw with people.
Maybe it's just a placeholder.
I think it's a... I don't think it means shit.
Maybe it's something for challenge mode, who knows.
But that would be cool if it wasn't.
Yes.
Yes, it would be.
Yeah, so 4th Plus Rules, and that's why I'm so excited that Konga Feelin' and Dream A Dream are going to be in with their respective music videos.
That is so cool.
That is so cool.
I'm so excited about that.
That's one thing that they're doing right, so right, that the Japanese mixes haven't been doing yet.
But I'll tell you what, this new British mix is coming out.
What's it called?
The Dancing...
Dancing Stage Fever, that sounds like the best DDR game yet.
It's got like nothing but licensed songs from all these decades of music.
It's got the fucking Spice Girls.
That's rad.
But the weirdest thing about it is that it's for the PS2 and PS1.
That's just, I find that very strange, that they made a version for each system.
So, do you think they'll run off different engines or something, or what do you think will happen?
I bet you this, well, the CD one won't have the videos, obviously.
It'll probably be a fifth mix.
Pretty much.
I think it's going to be a fifth mix engine, and then you're going to have the other one that's just, I don't know, probably just Max 2, obviously.
But, um...
Because it's a PS1 version, I can import that because I have a modded, you know, PlayStation stuff.
That'd be cool.
You're special.
Okay.
Why don't you tell us about what's going on in the sim?
Oh, well, no, let's take a break.
Let's take a break.
We're going to come back, and you want to do cage match next?
Cage match works.
Cage match works.
We're going to do the cage match when we come back.
If you want to participate in the... Yes, Loki.
Don't Call Me Baby wasn't on the Dancing Stage Fever mix.
No, actually, Madison Avenue, I can't remember if they're a European group or not.
I don't know.
That song was huge here in clubs, and it still is.
They play it every week at the club I go to.
I mean, it's still a huge dance song here.
I guess the question would be, somebody's got to determine where they're really licensing these songs from.
And you could probably figure it out with the record companies involved and everything.
Like, what, Euromix 2 had stuff licensed from Zamba, right?
But it was never really said where the licenses from the last Max USA was coming from.
SyFam, but Sandstorm's not a SyFam song, so there's somebody else involved too.
So who knows?
Who knows?
Please put my song in DDR!
I need exposure!
Maybe that.
Maybe, in the case of Steve Reiner, but hey, Dark Black Forest, I know a lot of people think it's played out.
It's the most annoying song ever.
Whatever, I totally disagree.
I think it was the best licensed song they had in Max USA, and I think it's awesome.
I did like Sandstorm better.
If I had to admit, their cover for Dancing Sage Fever is pretty gay.
It's really retarded.
I want to set that girl on fire.
Anyway, we'll be back.
And I think I played this song last week, but I don't care because the song rules.
And Jamie wanted to hear more DDR songs tonight, so I'm going to play a DDR song I want to hear.
And it's going to be a Max 2 USA, and that is good.
Okay.
Okay.
Thank you for watching!

Thank you for watching!
Please listen to Orange Lounge Radio, because real radio makes Captain Jack cry.
Hello everybody and welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio episode .59.
Uh, we're back.
Ha ha.
Ha ha, after some discussion on Max 2 USA and how was your week, how was your day?
Shark Skrull's been gone for what, about 30 minutes now, I'd say?
Not that long.
Not that long?
Where in the world is Melody?
At my house, probably.
I'm not funny at all today.
You are anti-funny.
I understand that.
And our anti-funny is Rob.
Ha ha ha.
Ha ha ha.
My anti-fun is Rob.
Anyway, Loki, how about a sim update, sir?
Oh, you want me to do stuff, okay.
But anyways, let's see, Stepmania came out with Beta 4, Alpha 4, I don't know what the fuck they're on now.
I think it's like Alpha 4 Beta something.
What are we on?
Oh, let's see.
We're on Step Mania 3.9 Alpha 4B.
Whatever the hell that means.
But anyways, yeah, so they have more stuff fixed.
Getting close to Step Mania 4, yippee.
And then, what else?
Oh yeah, DWI, I'm sure they did something.
Let's see.
Uh, DWI is just down this stupid 2.5.
They suck.
And, um, other than that, not real much going on other than, you know, tons of sim files coming out.
Um, Shuey released another part of the DDR sim file history collection.
More files from sites you've never heard of.
And, um, other than that, like I said, not too much.
Um...
Pretty much if you're looking for sim files, there are a couple places you can go.
Go to DDR Maniacs and check out, in their community news section, there's something about the sim file DC hub.
That's the direct connect hub.
You'll find...
A bunch of people in there with thousands of files they can go leech off of.
Also, there's going to be, you know, Bumai style, which you can find a bunch of cool stuff there.
And then you can also get off your ass and go do some searches on the internet and find your damn files yourself, you lazy bastard.
So, ha, I have to laugh about, oh yeah, there's some thing going on with DDR Freak about getting official sim file collections because, you know, no one has them anymore except for me and, you know, they can go fuck themselves because, not DDR Freak, but the project, the project that just happens to be on DDR Freak because, you know, I'm not sharing.
So, what have we established?
A, you're a pirate.
R, and B, you're a selfish pirate.
R, walk me plank.
You butthead, you need to be kicked.
Why?
Someone never spanked you when you were little.
No, but I think you know who's taking care of that now that Loki's in his 20s and all.
I don't get spanked from her.
Not from her, but, you know, your girlfriend.
I don't get spanked from her.
Never?
Never.
Never.
You guys are boring.
I see Dan all the time.
Hello, TMI, TMI alert, thank you.
No, I mean like literally like kick his butt a few times.
Uh-huh, uh-huh, nice recovery, yeah.
Oh, he's into the rough stuff.
You know, men need women to keep them in line.
If not for us, you guys would just fuck this planet up.
Sure.
You know, because all those crazy women drivers out there causing accidents, tying up our freaking highways and byways.
Yeah.
Just give me an evil look.
You are so dead when I'm over my sick.
You know what?
You can't hurt me.
I have the power of plane crashing.
You're going to catch multiple infection disease from her if you're not careful.
You know what?
I'm immune.
Oh my god, Jamie has to SARS.
I do not have SARS.
It's monkeypox.
I'm immune.
Oh my god.
I heard that SARS was coming back.
Like, it was a big thing on Yahoo.
Hey, you know, it's like, it's like, it's like Leif Garrett, okay?
All of a sudden, SARS making a comeback, right?
And what if you have SARS, Jamie?
I don't have SARS.
How do you know?
I've never been to China!
Have you been in contact with any Canadians lately?
Namely in the Toronto area?
Is Marin Chan the Secret League Canadian?
Oh my god, my spinners are coming from Toronto.
They're probably laced with SARS.
Oh my god, they're SARS-infested spinners.
You can shut up.
Okay, before we get killed, I think now's a good time to get into the Orange Lounge Radio.
Cage Match.
I'm ready for the fuck you's of the week.
Fuck you's of the week right after the Cage Match, I promise.
Last week in the Orange Challenge Radio Cage Match, Loki won when he brought to the table his pick from Cybertrans Presents ELT.
And Cybertrans, by the way, they're the folks that put together the...
Ayumi Trance, thank you, Ayumi Hamasaki Trance, which 23rd Magus swears you can buy at Dimple.
I'm going to get killed.
Anyway, the song, the particular song from that CD is called Face the Change.
It's remixed by Dirt Devils and Above and Beyond.
And above and beyond, very cool.
They do a lot of great remixes.
They did Madonna's What It Feels Like For A Girl video remix, and they also did M, Ayumi Hamasaki's M, which is a great sim file.
I like this song.
Alright, here it is, last week's winner, and this first song you can vote for in the Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match Oh, and if you want to vote, get to our chatroom, www.callybomani.com Click on Orange Lounge and click on Chat And then you can vote in tonight's Cage Match, it's just that simple The winning song goes into rotation all week long on Orange Lounge Radio Here's song number one, this is Every Little Thing, Cybertrance With Face the Change, Dirt Devils and Above and Beyond Remix And you only hear a clip of it because it won last week, here it is
Thanks for watching!
DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma
Thank you for watching!
I don't see that
Oops, dead air, sorry.
Dead air.
My bad.
You want to take the next song, Jamie, or you want me to?
Why not?
You're going to do it?
Yeah, why not?
Are you okay?
I'm having a nap.
You sound sleepy.
I'm taking a nap.
Okay, well, before you nap, tell us about your song pick for this week.
It's a remix of Tori Amos' Sugar.
I'm so proud of Jamie.
She picked Tori Amos this week.
It's a good song, and it sounds all dark and depressed.
So, this is a dark and depressing trance remix of Tori Amos with Sugar.
This is song number two you can vote for tonight.
DarkSakura's pick.
Here it is, the whole song.
DarkSakura's Pick
Don't say my name is gone, don't say that to me Like a day when I thought you were gone, I had to let you go
Thank you for watching!
I wish you love
Thank you for watching!
Okay, that was Tori Amos with Sugar, the trance remix.
And this is where we go around the room and everybody tells what they think about it and rate it.
Tori, you do no wrong.
And it's trancy, and it fit my mood today, so a ten.
A ten from Jamie.
Is the mic on?
Yes.
Sorry, I couldn't hear you through the monitors for some reason.
Okay, I hear it now.
Okay.
I don't know, that was weird.
Sorry, I'm having a SARS moment.
So a ten from Jamie, no surprise.
Loki.
It was alright.
It was mellow.
I give it a 7.
I agree.
Troy can do no wrong.
It sounds like a fan remix to me.
I don't know.
It sounds a little... Unpolished?
Yeah, unpolished.
That's what I'm looking for.
Thank you.
A little grainy was the thing I was going to look for.
But it's pretty damn well done.
I can't see myself giving it a 10 for some reason, but a 9.
9.5 even.
I do really like that.
That was very good.
And Tori is the shit.
I would be a horrible gay man if I were to give Tori a low score.
Anyway.
I hope that the mix fits the song.
It does.
It does really fit the song.
Have you heard the original of that song?
Not in a very long time.
Yeah, the remix fits it very well.
So whoever remixed that did a damn good job.
I would not be sad if that won at all.
I actually like all of tonight's cage match songs.
Usually there's one I'm kind of like, eh, I hope it doesn't win.
Tonight, I don't care what wins.
They're all good.
So, my pick, song number three.
Now, I knew that Loki won last week.
He had a trance song.
I knew Jamie was bringing a trance mix.
So, usually, when, you know, I know of trance, that there's going to be two trance songs, and I try to do something different, like crazy.
Like, I'll do something really, like, stupid crazy.
And usually that ends up being a Kylie Minogue song of some sort.
But tonight I thought, you know what, I don't really want to play Kylie Minogue.
Yeah, how dare you put Kylie against, you know, Tori.
Tori would up and kick her ass.
No, so I thought, I'm not going to put in Kylie Minogue.
Instead, I'm going to put in her sister, Dani Minogue.
What?
Because Dani Minogue is starting a singing career, so I'm going to put in a song by her.
This is Dani Minogue with Put the Needle on It, the Jason Nevins Ultra Pop Radio Edit.
And I heard this last night at the club and I liked it a lot, so it's my entry for tonight's cage match.
Here it is, enjoy.
Thank you for watching!
Thanks for watching!
Thank you for watching!
Thank you for watching!
Alrightio, song number three, Danny Minow, Put the Needle on It, Jason Evans mix.
Jamie?
I guess what's good for Kylie is good for Danny.
Break out the cookie cutter.
It wasn't bad, so you get the six.
Okay, Loki.
I like to give it an 8.
You actually told me to play... I played like four of them for you and you said that was the best one.
I agree.
I like that one.
In my opinion, that's the best one.
The remix is awesome.
It's porno.
It makes me want to do lap dances in Pixie Dust's lap and tug on her Kylie underwear.
I'm going to get killed for that.
I like that song a lot.
I give it a 9.
So...
There you go.
Those are your three picks for tonight.
So here they are.
Here's a quick clip.
Clip of each song.
And place vote now.
You send your votes to Sky over a private message in the chat room.
That's me.
I'm Sky.
Hi.
How you doing?
I'm in the chat room over at Calibamani.com.
Click on Orange Lounge and click on chat, and then send me a private message with your vote.
Song 1, Song 2, or Song 3.
In case you forgot, here they are again.
First off, last week's winner, Every Little Thing, Cybertrans, Face the Change.
Alright, song number 2 you can vote for tonight, Tori Amos with Sugar, the Trance remix.
or song number three, Danny Minow with Put the Needle On It, the Jason Evans mix.
All right.
There you go.
Place votes now.
You know what?
I think it's time to rant.
All right.
Not like the FUs of the week because our chat room has to respond to that, too, and they can't do that while they're voting.
What now, Jamie?
Just kidding.
I love you.
Hi.
Hi.
I'm ranting about retarded people.
I just noticed you can see my construction table on the webcam.
That's pretty cool.
Let her rant.
Just about... Don't rant about retarded people.
They can't help it.
I'm talking about people who aren't retarded but act retarded.
Oh, okay.
Okay.
Just people who have, like... People need to go to school before they're allowed on the internet.
And I mean go to school and actually pass, like, grammar and spelling before they're allowed on the internet.
People need... I think...
You know, I was reading on my mailing list for J-List how there's like a test for everything in Japan.
You know, like your fluency levels, there's a test to play baseball good enough.
There's tests for everything.
They need to have tests for everything here.
Where, like, you have to have a certain level of proficiency before you're allowed to breathe.
Or...
Maybe not that extreme.
But like, you know, you have your internet level proficiency, so when you log into the internet, you have this number that you can go on the web with and be allowed to type.
Or, you know, have your degree of, you know, like with driving too, you need to keep testing, but you know, when you reach a certain age, you need to take like the I'm still okay to drive test, or
And in some cases, especially with driving, when you get to a certain age, you need to take it every year.
Yes.
When you get to 65, you have to... In fact, when you're like 85, you need a monthly exam.
And they need to make sure that you can see over the fucking dashboard.
Thank you.
You're also... You also need to... what?
Especially if you're a little Asian woman in the Bay Area with SUV.
SUV.
Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
with, uh, you need to, like, take the parental responsibility test.
You think it wouldn't be that, you wouldn't need that much intelligence to be a parent?
I mean, all you gotta do is put it in the right hole.
I mean, that's pretty much it.
No, that's, that's, that in and of itself is just breeding.
People can fucking, fucking, fucking fuck all they want to and, you know, sprout babies like bunnies.
I think it's all the stuff that they're taking while they're breeding.
But I think that, you know, there's, there's not many responsible parents around these days, you know?
Don't you agree?
Yeah.
And, you know, the people that I know personally, I'd say they're fairly responsible.
Me, I know I'm not responsible enough right now to be a parent, so I'm not going to go out and do something.
I'm not even responsible enough to own a pet.
I have a Shermie.
But Shermie poops in a box, and I only have to clean up after her once a day.
Okay?
I don't have to change a diaper 20 million times a day.
Right?
Yeah.
Oh, yeah.
I think, it's just, I was, I was, when I was out and about earlier in the week, I was just noticing, you know, little children running off to do whatever and their parents were sitting there on their cell phones.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com
That's why, and I was thinking of this when I was listening to, you know, I was very, very, you know, I guess proud when I was listening to Vandalist talk about, you know, how much time and care they take into, you know, he takes with his family.
I just wish that there were more people like that, you know.
They should limit families to have only one child, just like they do in China.
No, I think that people... And you're being a fascist.
You know, you can't literally step in there.
This is America, land of the free.
I mean, as great of an idea as it sounds.
And there should be certain people that are limited to one child or zero child.
It's not possible.
Child services don't step in, you know, for neglect until the child's already dead, left in their car for five hours, you know, burned to death or asphyxiated or whatever.
You know, I...
I just really think that it's very sad and I needed to take a moment to get that out of my system because, you know, this was on the news just, what, last week?
Or like, you know, with Disneyland with the gum on the rail, you know?
Stupid child, parent wasn't watching, you know?
There was probably a little kid looking for a quarter on the track and that's how the train derailed.
It's, you know, people need to take responsibility.
Now, since I brought up Disneyland again, all the cool rides have gone away because of stupid people.
I mean, look at, like, the People Mover.
The People Mover, while slow, was a good way... He did not get rid of the People Mover.
Yes, he did.
Oh, my God.
They got rid of the People Mover.
They got it...
Disneyland did not get rid of the PeopleMover, did they?
Yeah, like, you can go to hell.
I hope all their rides derail.
The PeopleMover was the coolest thing on the entire planet.
And if they got rid of it, oh!
You know why they got rid of it?
Because some dumb fuck thought it'd be a cool idea to rock the thing and it fell over.
Well, then kill him!
Just kill him!
Give me a gun, I'll shoot the fucker myself.
Well, actually, he did die.
Don't tell me they got rid of Mr. Toad's Wild Ride.
No, they didn't get rid of that.
I'm driving to Anaheim right now.
But then they replaced the PeopleMover...
They replaced the, um, what was it, the people movers?
No, it's not gone, but it's not working.
Submarine's gone.
Are they going to get rid of the teacups because someone got sick?
Look, you stupid bitch, you can see how the ride works.
You're going to spin around and around and around and around about a...
That was in goddamn time.
If you don't think you can't handle it without puking, then fuck off.
They're basically these things that go really fast.
Like, they just have the acceleration rate on them is just ungodly, like, huge.
But that's the problem was is, I don't know, someone did something in that one, like stood up or something, and they died too on that.
So that's why those guys... Maybe someone should die on It's a Small World.
They will never ever have to have it again.
Oh, God, I wish.
It's a Small World is so lame.
Yeah, that's the other thing is that it takes someone dying...
And then they get rid of things that other people have in front of them.
They better not get rid of Thunder Mountain Railroad.
That ride rocked.
Okay.
No, they're probably going to turn it into, you know, like, I don't know, Daffy Duck's, you know, piano adventure.
I don't know.
I'm thinking of Roger Rabbit.
Piano adventure, so there's a piano on a track.
It's a runaway piano.
People do not know what the People Mover is in our chat room.
That's fine, because we have people from all parts of the world that listen to Orange Entree.
The People Mover is a ride at Disneyland.
It's in Tomorrow World, because Disneyland is broken up into all these little areas.
You have the New Orleans section, and the jungle section, and you have Tomorrowland, which is all the futuristic stuff.
That's where the Star Wars ride is.
We all know, yeah, 50 years ago anyway, it was the Tomorrow stuff.
But, you know, that's where Captain Neo was, that's where Space Mountain is.
Anyway, so, PeopleMover was this little ride, and you sat on it, and you just, it was like a little trolley, and you went all around Tomorrow World, and it gave you a little lecture about all the little things that were going on, but the end of it,
It was narrated by Tim Curry.
And if they got rid of the people mover, Disneyland could go fuck itself.
There wasn't too big of a line for me to go on the PeopleMover the one time I've been.
See, that was the funny thing.
It wasn't every time.
No one used to go on the PeopleMover because it was like, ooh, PeopleMover is Space Mountain.
We'll go on Space Mountain.
PeopleMover is just like, I'm tired of walking.
I just want to sit down for a little bit.
It was great.
You know they've been doing Space Mountain now.
Space Mountain is closed for renovations.
Yeah, because it sucks.
It's old.
I've only been on it once, so it was fun for me.
They had techno music in there.
That'd rock.
Well, anyway, back to... What was I ranting about?
Stupid people?
Kids.
Kids, yeah, kids.
They need a ride that's just like F-Zero.
I think that kids will grow up better if they had the same exposure to stuff that we had.
They need tetherball.
Children eat tether balls so that, you know, if you get hit in the head enough times, you know, duck, dodge the ball.
Parents have to understand that there's a certain percentage of kids that will get raped and molested by people.
Just accept the fact and hope that your kids aren't part of the statistic.
You can't protect them from everything.
You have to prepare them as best as you can.
Take responsibility.
Molestation builds character.
No, it doesn't.
No, it doesn't.
Don't talk about that.
But, you know, they take away everything.
You know, all the stuff that we had when we were kids, you know, that stuff was cool.
We had, you know, I fell off of the freaking, you know, monkey bars before, busted my lip open.
I have a scar right here, see.
and I'm perfectly well adjusted.
Oh, I cried.
Ow, you know.
I was stupid and I never fell off of the monkey bars again.
What's up with these pansy playground equipment that they have now?
It's all like powder.
Plastic.
Plastic.
Whatever happened to the really cool wood stuff?
You're going to get rid of sand boxes next because children are going to eat sand.
I ate my pies.
Look at me.
I'm normal.
Well, relatively.
I grew up mostly adjusted.
You know, forget this.
When I was back in Alabama, I went by my elementary school.
And I swear, all the metal things that I used to climb on, only a couple of them were there and they were rusted over so that nobody would want to touch them because they looked nasty.
It's not fun anymore.
Not fun to be a kid these days.
Especially with the Teletubbies teaching you that it's okay to go up to a perfect stranger and give them a hug.
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
I'm going to hug you.
Oop, watch me be a kid now.
You're so retarded.
You missed the whole thing we just did, so we're going to do it again.
You know, the world is not bright sunshine.
Repetition is fun.
You know, when I was little... You know, okay, you know what I was raised with when I was five?
I freaking had...
Well, what did I watch when I was a kid?
I watched the Smurfs, and the Smurfs taught you that there's fire and it burns down the trees, and the wolf's not a happy singing place.
And the Smurfs promote homosexuality.
Yes, they do.
Except when they got, you know, Smurfette, but I think that, you know... Smurfette.
It was like a colony of ants.
They all fucked the queen.
And then when I was... How old was I?
1983?
84?
I was about...
7, the best show ever came on TV, Transformers, at Transformers at G.I.
Joe.
I mean, there's a different Transformers than the one with these little Transformers that they protect, and it's like Pokemon.
Okay, forget it.
You know, I don't watch that Armada crap.
Or what about the ones where they turned into dinosaurs?
I love that one, and apes and stuff.
Hey, don't forget about Xenobots.
Yeah, whatever.
Okay.
But, you know, I had, what, Jason the Wheel Warriors, we had Voltron, we had... Now, what is there to watch on TV now?
Pokemon, Digimon... Digimon's cool, don't mock Digimon.
But Pokemon's retarded, okay?
Yu-Gi-Oh!
And Digimon people die, okay?
Why are we teaching kids to play cards?
Isn't that like, can I take it?
That's the way it is.
You're going to get a paper cut and get infected and die.
And then cards will be banned.
It was the same thing when we were kids.
Every cartoon had its elaborate marking scheme that went with it.
Like, everybody wanted the He-Man that you would punch it and the little thing would spin around and make it look like it was damaged.
They don't have battle damage toys anymore, do they?
I know!
That's so stupid.
You know, we had really cool things when we were young.
I'll tell you what.
I cry for today's children.
You know what toy I played with more than anything, though?
More than anything, what toy I played with?
Legos.
I had Lincoln Logs and they were made out of wood.
And I got splinters in my fingers when I tried to break them.
DarkSakura.com
I built catapults with my Lincoln Logs.
You put, like, one of those small ones on a nice, you know, roof piece.
These rubber bands.
And you can hit it just really hard and it goes... I would build parts of my houses with rubber bands so that I could make them collapsible so they would kill my little weeblemen that I put inside of them.
Comment from the chat room.
This is how you know it's all coming to an end.
Guess what?
Rice Princess says she saw Transformers on MTV.
Can I cry?
You may have a sniff now.
Unless it was the old ones, but if it was the new crappy ones, then I'm going to try.
Yes, Naoki2DX's winner, Tinker Toys.
Tinker Toys are the shit.
I had Tinker Toys too.
Construx.
Construx.
I had a whole fucking tub of Construx.
I had the Tinker Toys that were life-size.
They were the size of me, okay?
They kicked ass.
You could build giant things that hurt people.
And they didn't have... They had, like, the building pieces were like PVC pipes.
So, you know, you could fight with the pieces and you could, like, injure people.
It was awesome.
And Constructs, I had tons of those things.
Oh, my God, just tons.
We had...
We had these things that were like plastic, hard plastic sticks with foam on them.
And you could beat each other up with foam.
But if you took the foam off, they were sticks and you could whack people in the head with them.
And like, toys were lethal when we were young.
Growing up was survival.
And look at us, we're strong.
Yeah, because we're not dead from our toys.
I think Pixie Dust is saying in the chat room that the Smurfs are a reminder of the Anna Nicole show.
Okay.
Anyway, how about the winner of the cage match?
Okay.
The winner of tonight's Orange Lounge cage match.
Are you closing?
Yes, I'm closing.
Eat your vegetables.
More spinach.
You need iron.
The winner of tonight's Orange Lounge Cage Match, I'm actually somewhat surprised by this, but the chatroom did vote this one as the winner tonight.
It is last week's winner, Every Little Thing, Face the Change.
Once again, curse you, Loki, and your cursed trance music.
Alright, so I think now's a good break time, huh?
What do you say when we come back we let the real ranting begin, eh?
Sure.
The FUs of the week when we come back.
Also, before we get into the FUs of the week, though, I want to talk about my gaming experiences this week.
Because I've actually been playing more video games this week.
So I want to talk about some games.
Gasp!
Gasp.
So, we'll be back.
Dreamer Dreamer, take me in your dream Take me anywhere you please Boy, you're making me scream Dreamer Dreamer, life is just a dream If you wanna set me free Boy, you're making me scream Ooh, la-la-dee, la-la-da You've got a dreamer dreamer
We rock the spot, no!
You gotta dream of being a dream
Thanks for watching!
Hi, this is Mel B of RTF.
And for an extra $1.99 a minute, my girlfriend Mel B can join us on all the fun together.
But hey, if you're a broke ass like I am, why don't you come to one place that costs absolutely nothing to go to and still the fun is just as great.
It's Orange Lounge Radio, Sunday nights.
Kick it with me and you just might realize the best things in life are free.
Hello, we're back.
Uh, guess he's back.
Oh.
Yes, Shark Skrull's back.
Hello.
Hello.
So you're back finally.
We were starting to worry a little bit.
We were like, well, she's been gone a while.
At least I was.
I was worried.
The freaking lights just take forever.
Although I saw the funniest low-riding truck ever.
Dude, it looked like its ass was dragging on the ground, and it had spinners.
Oh, God.
Those are the most annoying things on the planet, those things that spin.
I almost pulled out my ditch cam and took a picture of it.
It was that bad, but he turned before I could do it.
Spinners are horrible, and it's even worse on a low-riding truck that's dragging its ass on the ground.
What did we see earlier?
I don't remember.
Tell them what we saw.
We saw the ultimate of crap low-riders.
It was so ghetto.
It was, like, bad, like, paint job, red and white.
And it was just, like, some crappy Chevy.
And, no, the fearless sticker was the one in my house that was really crappy, too.
You know, if your car looks like crap, make it look good before you put a sticker on it that has fearless on it.
I don't... People just fear my car when I'm in it.
My little Tercel can do some damage.
I took a picture of my dream car, though, one of my dream cars.
There was a 350Z in the parking lot in Madeira, so I took a picture of it because I want one.
Madeira.
Madeira.
I had a fun time at the fair.
That's a suburb of Fresno.
I had a fun time at the fair, though.
You went to Fresno.
I did not go to Fresno.
I went to some place.
You went to a place that's worse than Fresno.
Madeira District Fair.
I still have this stain of blue on my hand, too, from where they stamped my hand.
It looks like a bruise.
Shall we get into the FUs of the week?
Showa!
This is the best part of the show.
Here is justice.
Here is punishment.
Here is... This is fucked up.
Fuck being sick.
Actually, that was real.
Good timing, my lungs.
Fuck being sick.
Fuck trying to enjoy myself while being sick.
Because I try and try and try, but being sick sort of overshadows it.
And I had a very good time at the concert, so that was great, but I just felt horrible.
And I've been sick since Tuesday.
And it got bad enough for me to go to the doctor on Thursday, and I don't go to the doctor, so this is the first time I've actually been to a doctor on my own in seven years.
Yes, I'm an angry girl.
It's on my card.
Duh.
Um, you know...
Fuck stupid people and parents who don't know how to take responsibility for their children.
And fuck things that suck.
And not having money.
Not having money is the big suck of all.
I could stand being sick if I had money because then I could go on the internet and shop.
I can't even do that.
Sick.
So, yeah, that's not it.
Fuck being sick.
Okay, Loki, I know you're cooking, but it's your turn.
He's making the bacon crap.
Oh, I don't believe that for a minute.
Loki says he doesn't have anything.
He's cooking.
You're going to give up your chance to rant about something?
Fuck cooking!
Here.
Um, yeah, F you to stuff.
and stupid people.
You actually had a good week and nobody bothered you.
That's amazing.
Yeah, no.
I didn't have a good week and people bothered me.
But it's not really anything out of the usual.
I see.
Yeah, it's because grease and fire don't mix.
You're the one that I want.
I want, I want to... I'll be back.
I'm sure I'll interject something later.
Oh, hooray.
My turn.
My FU this week goes to Walmart.
Because Walmart is evil.
Walmart is the worst place on the face of the planet.
I'll tell you why.
Fine.
All you're going to find is V8 Splash.
I love V8 Splash.
Because I don't drink soda anymore.
I'll have the occasional diet, but I'm really trying to not do that.
I'm really, really trying to not do that.
So, V8.
I have V8.
Splash is mostly what I drink in iced tea and lemonade.
Mixed.
I like that, too.
V8 Splash is good, especially Diet V8 Splash, because it's made with Splenda.
It tastes like Propel.
Anyway, my entry of the week goes to Walmart, because they suck.
I went to Walmart on Saturday night with LankyStyle, because I wanted a new F-Zero game for GameCube.
And I was all excited, because the new F-Zero game for GameCube is supposed to kick ass.
And I had a $10 off at Walmart card, because my work gives out gift cards as incentives.
So when we do something really good, we get a gift card.
So I had a $10 gift card to Walmart.
Because they ask people at work, what places would you like a gift card to?
And people are like, Walmart.
So, anyway, I decide I'm going to go to Walmart to get an F-Zero game.
I get there.
Nobody's there.
Nobody's in the electronics department.
So I just kind of stand at the desk and wait, because you know how they have the games in the case?
You can't just reach in, pull out the game, take it to checkout.
You have to get somebody to open the case for you so you can get the game.
Heaven forbid you carry around a game as big as the DVDs that you can buy in the rack next door.
Anyway, finally this nice lady, she looked over, she was stacking movies and she saw me and she came over and she said, can I help you type thing?
And I said, yeah, I wanted to get that game.
And she's like, oh, I don't have the key.
Let me get somebody who can get the key.
I'm like, they don't have the key behind the counter?
Fine.
Get the manager, get the key.
So they get one of those people, after 10 minutes, at least 10 minutes, they get... Oops, sorry, my music ran out here.
After at least 10 minutes, finally one of those folks in the red vests, who I guess are like, you know, super Walmart stars, or whatever they are, managers, assistant managers, whatever they are, they're the red vest people.
At Walmart you have the blue vest people who are the normal drones, and the red vest people who command the blue drones, right?
So a red vest came by...
And he had the wrong key.
He tried to open it up and he had the wrong key.
And the woman who was there was like, no, no, no, you need the blue and green one, not the blue one.
Apparently everything's color-coded at Walmart.
So he leaves, and ten minutes later, after waiting another ten minutes, he comes back and says, I can't find it.
So finally the lady says, I'm so sorry, I know where the key is, I'll go get it.
So she goes off.
Ten minutes later, she comes back.
Sir, I'm so sorry.
After a half hour now of waiting.
Sir, I'm so sorry.
The key isn't where it's supposed to be.
What the fuck?
Do you mean the key's not where it's supposed to be?
Who opened the case?
No one opened the case between the time I was there and when she was there.
Where was the manager?
Where was anybody running the electronics department?
Why aren't things where they're supposed to be?
Why isn't the key behind the counter?
Why doesn't the red vest guy carry the key?
Why doesn't he know what the hell color key goes with what?
Doesn't he know how to run his own fucking store?
Fuck.
I was about to say, go to the hardware department and get me a hammer.
I'll fix this.
Seriously.
So.
God.
So I didn't get my game.
I'm pissed.
I leave Walmart and I don't get anything.
So I went the next day to Target.
I purposely went to Target.
I could have gone to GameSpot where I usually get games.
No, I went to Target because I purposely wanted to buy it for the competition.
So I went in and within two minutes there was a guy behind the desk.
He opened the case up, got my game, rang it up right there.
I was in and out of Target in three minutes.
I'm done.
Your turn, Melody.
Wow, are you sure you want to do this?
Yes.
Fuck traffic, fuck red lights, fuck the cell phone reception in this damn area because it keeps dropping my hook.
And fuck the fucking truck that's parked in Jamie's parking lot because I freaking hit it!
And Jamie says she's almost hit it a bunch of times.
And the funny thing is, you couldn't fucking tell that I hit the damn car.
It's like so beat up and crappy, you can't even tell.
Oh, Jamie wants to elaborate.
Fuck everybody who parks along that fence.
Damn them all to hell.
Yeah, it's like, it's parking spots, and then people parallel park right behind you, so it's like a freaking obstacle course.
And I had a car trying to come in that was trying to hurry me up, but apparently I just went a little too far.
And I couldn't see the truck, because it was right directly behind me.
I was looking over my shoulder, but you couldn't tell.
And I was like, oh, fuck.
So, yeah, fuck that, and fuck having to drive home now, because I was stupid and forgot something.
Anyway, I forgot my computer.
So, fuck having to drive home, and fuck having to work tomorrow, because I really don't want to.
Wow, okay.
I'm angry tonight.
Shall we hear from our chatroom?
Alright, here they go.
Chatroom FUs.
DarkTetsuya says, F you to missing most of the show.
And F you to morons at the theater.
If you're gonna make cracks about the movie, that's what watching it at home is for.
And F you not having Soul Calibur 2.
Wait, I have to add something though there with the movie.
Yes, Shark Skrull.
Sometimes that's better than the movie itself.
I definitely agree.
It really depends on the movie you're seeing.
Because like, when we went and saw Pokemon, yelling back at the screen made it ten times better.
Spice World, Case Point, thank you.
I saw Spice World opening day too.
High five!
I saw Spice World for free.
I didn't have to pay for it.
We were going to dress as Spice Girls and everything, but we didn't have time.
It was us and all these junior high girls.
Yeah, we were the only people in the theater.
My friend and I were the only people in the theater without a kid.
It was kind of scary, actually.
I had so much fun at Spice World.
Oh, I have the tape.
I have a promo poster.
I have a promo poster I won.
Anyway.
Back to the angst, please.
But Spicer, I'm fine.
23rd Magus.
He's pretty angsty.
F you to Angel's work schedule.
This makes a whole month she's missed Orange Lounge.
I cry.
A big fuck you to controlling parents who use the because it's my house argument.
It is their house.
Now I'm not allowed to leave my bedroom after 1 a.m.
Okay, you can live in the dorms.
What the fuck?
F you to the CIS department dean at ARC for dropping me for my PC repair class.
Bitch, die.
John Fields would like to say F you to Adobe Premiere freezing up a lot.
F you to one of my hard disks dying.
F you to classes that require outside class activity beyond homework.
EvilMauki2DX says, F you for me not being able to oogle the sweet Lancer Evolution 4 I saw in Japantown today.
And F you to my parents for changing plans for Benihana at the last minute.
F you to not being able to call uni when I want.
Ninst would like to say F you to various things in my apartment like the crappy shower head and the mailbox key that doesn't work.
F you to class starting up again.
F you to the physics department at my college physics department for not letting me register yet.
F you to furniture in a box.
DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
But this is the new one, right?
Not the one that's closer to me, actually.
If I wanted to go to the close Ikea, I'd just go to the one in Burlingame.
Emeryville.
No, the new one's in East Palo Alto, and I work in, like, Palo Alto.
I have a friend that's moving to Palo Alto this week.
Oh, wow, cool.
He's cute.
You should be his friend.
Anyway.
Put him on Friendster.
Put him on Friendster.
Okay.
F you to the idiot who hit my neighbor's car.
They hit the end trying to pull into his spot.
Yeah, it was Shark's Girl.
And my neighbor and myself watched as this happened.
The guys just looked right at us, pulled out, and tried to hide further down in the parking lot.
John Fields would like to clarify, or give another F you.
F you to websites that force you to say yes to their install programs.
I'm sick of hitting the power button on my computer because of them.
Mozilla is your friend.
Just click no.
Yeah, stop going to porn and wear sites, because those are the only sites I know of that force you to click yes.
No.
Well, all you have to do is just use the Google toolbar.
Pull out that four.
Lastly...
Pixie Dust says, well first off, a big F you to myself for getting a new tattoo.
It is scabby and hurts me.
So yeah, I'm not too comfy right now.
I don't know.
What is it of?
We want to hear it, Pixie Dust.
The ugly mofo I went out with for a month in April.
F you for ruining my birthday pics with your face.
You remember him, Sky?
Yes, I do.
And another F you goes to people who have been moody and bitchy around me.
Get off your poopy ass toilet and get happy.
That is the best thing ever.
Get off your poopy ass toilet.
Come on, get happy.
Someone take that quote.
Take that quote right now and post it in the Orange Islands Live Journal.
Right now.
Get off your poopy ass toilet and get happy.
Yes, post it now.
I nominate DarkTetsuya to run that task because he always posts in the community.
DarkTetsuya, get on that, please.
Let me cut and paste for your copying pleasure here.
Yes.
Don't tell me no.
No.
I think he's telling 23 Magus no.
You can tell him no yo you want.
Alright.
Anyway.
On with Pixie Dust FUs.
By the way, I found the camera for my birthday dinner and that brings up all the bitchiness towards that asshole and the way he dubbed me.
He was... You can do so much better than that, Janae.
FU to Sky for not liking Walmart.
Screw you too, bitch.
It is ghetto, but hell, I got a new Razor with free refills for only five bucks.
LOL.
I'll get over the Walmart thing, but that made me mad.
I'll get over it.
I'll shop at Walmart again.
But they can eat me.
And I won't go to that one by Brad and Irene's house because there's a Target right there and Target's cooler.
And they have good smelling soap.
Fuck you to Los Rios District for stealing my money.
Bunch of greedy bastards that want to take my money and not buying my book back or refunding my $54 fee.
Okay, done.
Love you all.
Mwah.
Oh, Loki wants to go now because he thought of something, and now he has bacon in his system, so... Can we get a mic over to Loki?
Causing his angst level to rise.
That's it.
They're done.
That was the last one.
Have you seen Stupid News Reporters covering the Disneyland tragedy?
Or, uh...
I mean, that's just stopping you.
F you to Gray Davis, because you suck.
And just because you think immigrants should now not drive, well, good for you.
Hello, hello, hello.
News alert, that's an assembly bill.
It's not just Gray Davis.
This is the only thing that bothers me about the recall.
I think they should recall the entire fucking assembly, because Gray Davis gets blamed for all these bills.
Sure, he signs them when he can veto them, but he's not the sole...
What we do?
He signs the bill.
I sign a check.
What's your point?
Anyways, so, um, yeah, FD to Gray Davis, because, you know, you like illegal immigrants in the country because they do dirty work.
Um, I think we should kick you out of the country because you suck.
Somebody's stealing my bacon.
Ass.
Ass.
My bacon.
Mmm, super bacon.
Mmm, bacon-y.
Boy, this is super bacon.
Is it?
It's moderate super bacon.
Oh, it's moderate bacon.
Melody really likes the autographed picture of Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen.
That's just a temporary placeholder until I get the porno pictures of them.
No.
I'm done.
All right.
FUsOfTheWeekAreDone.com.
Hooray.
So I have something else on my mind.
Oh, Jamie has something to say?
I want pancakes right now.
Oh, God.
I wish there was like an IHOP near here.
I want... Yeah, but it's closed.
Isn't it?
I think so.
I want pumpkin pancakes.
Besides, you had IHOP yesterday.
You don't want it again today.
I want pumpkin pancakes.
And we have Mongolian.
That means, you know, Mongolian means you go poop a lot.
The Mongolian is sick again.
You know what?
I found a way to not have a diarrhea bomb after Mongolian today.
What?
I didn't put any oil in it.
I only put about half the noodles I usually do.
I put no oil in it.
I put nothing but teriyaki sauce and sweet and sour sauce in it.
I'm going to show you something.
Do you see this bottle?
Yes.
I'm going to hold it up.
I've got to cover my name because we have our names.
Oh, well, don't put it on the webcam.
I am, too.
All right.
Oh, good.
My name's not on here.
Okay, I'll let you know how long you have to hold it there.
Oh, it took a ghost picture.
You got 50 seconds before it goes again.
Okay, so while we're waiting.
Alright, look at that ghosty thing.
That's erythromycin.
It makes you poop.
Never eat Mongolian barbecue when you're on antibiotics.
Thank you.
Okay.
Actually, the one thing that works better than this for going to the bathroom is sugar-free Hershey's dark chocolate.
But today's Mongolian, I just want to say today's Mongolian only made me fart a lot.
It did not make me go to the bathroom and just unload.
Loki, can you say that in a microphone, please?
Something that'll make you crap more is 746 All Purpose Cleanser.
It's what they use to clean all the countertops and stuff at Roundtable.
If they put that on your pizza and you eat it, it'll make you shit out.
I mean, someone did that to me once, and I never knew that that much crap could be in my body.
I think I shit solid, like, I shit... Solid shit?
No, I... I shit for a complete hour, like, just non-stop shitting.
It's like going on a diet.
It's like that stuff.
No, I wonder if that's all that, you know that Hollywood diet?
Yeah, the colon cleanser, the Hollywood diet that you can buy at Walgreens and you basically mix it with water and you're supposed to take it on a weekend because you don't want to take this at work because you're going to spend your weekend vacationing on the throne, vacationing on the porcelain throne.
Bring a Game Boy and a bathroom reader because it's going to be a long weekend.
That's the only place that, like, you know, the British Excel is in toilet technology.
Because they have some really kick-ass toilets.
Dude, why isn't the bidet huge here?
That's what I want to know.
Bidets are the shit.
No pun intended.
I would love to have a bidet.
That would kick ass.
I would... Japanese super toilet.
Oh, yeah.
A Japanese super... Man.
I want a bidet.
Let's talk to our landlord and see if we can get a bidet in here.
Yeah.
I think now's a good time to take a break.
Can we just take a break?
We did the FUs of the week.
Oh yeah, I must have been caught.
It just feels like a break.
This break I'm going to play .59 again, but I'm going to play a special remix of it.
Because a lot of people have been requesting this in chat rooms.
So, this is a really good remix of .59 too.
So, to celebrate episode 59, which is what we're in right now, here's .59, the piano version, a Naoki remix.
Enjoy!
Enjoy!
Thanks for watching!
Let's listen in on an Orange Lounge Radio staff meeting.
Do we want to be accepted by Hollywood?
No!
Do we care what people think of us?
No!
Do we want people to kiss our ass?
Yes!
Extreme Bomani Radio, that's us, Orange Lounge Radio.
Shark Skrull is waving goodbye to all of you on the camera right now.
And then Loki is putting up some bacon.
Any final thoughts from you since you're leaving?
Tip your waiter.
Very nice.
Have a safe drive.
Thank you for coming.
Tell everyone in the bay we said hello.
I'm stealing another piece of bacon.
That's another F you to rob for stealing Loki's bacon.

Jamie's playing with the webcam, so you might see some interesting things on the cam for the next little bit.
If you don't know our cam's address, go to our chat room, www.callybomani.com.

P.S.
Visit the forums while you're there.
Sharks Girl has left the building.
Bye, Sharks Girl.
Good all.
We're good enough.
Tell Mel we said hi, too.
Too bad he couldn't be here.
He was stuck working.
So, um...
I was at Virgin Megastore this week.
No, I'm not a virgin.
Sharks girl, weren't you leaving?
No, I'm kidding.
I love you.
I went to a Virgin Megastore this week and I was doing some shopping and I picked this up.
This is pretty cool.
I picked up the single for Drifting Away.
Lang featuring Sky with Drifting Away, the single.
Here, I'll put this up on cam.
Oh, I can't put it up on cam for another 50 seconds when it refreshes.
It's an interesting little background picture, just a little sunset.
It has four tracks.
It has the radio edit, which you're probably all familiar with.
The original 12-inch mix.
A Beam vs. Cyrus remix with Sucks Balls and the Lang Sunset Dove, which is okay.
But I thought it was kind of neat to walk into the store and it was like, ooh, a Bomani single!
Because I didn't think this song had actually been released in the U.S.
So that was kind of a pleasant surprise.
What?
Are you sure that's not an import?
I don't think so.
It didn't have the little import sticker on it.
And you know what's cool is it's put out by Radical Records, who did that Time After Time CD, if I remember right.
Yes?
I'm not sure.
Anyway, I'll put this up on the cam so you guys can see what the CD looks like.
So I picked up... I don't believe this is an import, but... Who knows?
Um...
I think I got it blurry.
Oh well, forget it.
I can't hold my hand still.
You have to deal.
Yeah, deal with it.
So that's on the cam if you want to see what that looks like.
It's 9.02.
Wow.
I know we're cruising through the show here.
Is there anything you wanted to bring up?
No.
Yeah, I guess we do Ask Orange Lounge.
You can see it clearly.
Yeah, you can see it clearly enough on the cam.
If you want to Ask Orange Lounge a question... Actually, I want to bring up something.
Okay, well...
I have a new forum for people who are into gaming of all kinds
It's at roleplay.darksakura.com.
Sign up.
I run, basically, there's going to be freeform games run there.
If you want to run a game using the message board system, send me a private message, and I'll get your game set up, get you set up as moderator.
for your forum, for your group.
We'll get you set up.
Also, we have different game discussions, different types of games.
So if there's a game that you want to have an open discussion on, let me know.
Just sign up for your account and we'll set you up.
It's that easy.
Also, since you brought up Tuesday's show, let's give a plug for all our spinoff shows.
I didn't say what time my show is.
Okay, well, Tuesday, well, I'll start with, I should start with Monday, yes?
Yeah, you just want to go first.
Yeah, I know.
Monday nights is Vanilla Sky, and, um, it originally was going to have a rotating panel, I was going to have different people in here every week, but, um, Brad and Irene have worked out so well that they're just here, pretty much the perma-co-hosts on Vanilla Sky, where we talk about, um,
We talk about everything, kind of like, we talk about other game stuff, and then we talk about things outside of that.
We talk about what's going on in the real world, also, outside of your computer, from a nerdy point of view, definitely.
And we do such crazy antics as, I guess, the Yahoo Talkback, because people on Yahoo are stupid.
And we do, of course, bad music and video game trivia.
Have you listened to bad music and video game trivia yet, Jamie?
Um, no.
It's exciting.
What I do is I give video game trivia.
I question Brad and Irene on a certain topic.
Like last week it was racing games.
It was a topic.
I quizzed them on racing games.
And for every question they get wrong, we bring up the volume of some bad music.
Like last week was Barbra Streisand music.
Barbra Streisand's cool.
Well, you know, everybody, no matter what I pick, somebody always goes, but I like that person.
The first week it was Enya, then it was Celine Dion.
Celine Dion, yeah.
So Leon has only done one good song and it was Meatloaf.
And we talk a lot about Puzzle Pirates too.
It's kind of turning into a Puzzle Pirates show almost.
You don't play Ragnarok with me anymore.
It's because I didn't renew my account.
I'm waiting for that other thing.
Well, renew for another month and play with me.
I'm waiting for the Dyslexic Rollo fan club to open up.
That's all.
Renew your account and play with me.
I'll think about it.
But I like Puzzle Pirates a lot.
So, that's it.
That's what you can look for on my show.
My show is Tuesday.
It's basically, it's all requests.
It's called Pump Up the Volume because I'm a big 80s nerd fan.
So, it starts at 7.30, although I have a 7 o'clock pre-show because I usually just have that on while I go to the bathroom.
Oh, did I say that on the air?
My bad.
But no, it starts at 7.30 unless you want to catch the pre-show beforehand.
I play requests, so I hardly talk so you don't have to listen to my crappy voice.
I sometimes talk, you know, discuss things.
I'd like to have a guest, but no one ever wants to come hang out with me on Tuesday.
I'd come some week, but you have me on this show.
You have me on this show.
Yeah, I don't need you anymore.
You need to get some other... You have other... You need to get Shark Skull or... I don't know.
I'll try to arrange a guest.
Get Dan.
Dan's working Tuesday nights.
That's why I do the show Tuesday.
But if you're in our chat room, then you can send me a private message that night, and I will play anything that you want, if I have it, or something by the same group.
Unless you request, like, Spice Girls.
I played Vitamin C. Vitamin C's cool, though.
But there's just, like, very few things that are on my I Will Not playlist, and usually that's, like, a couple of songs.
I want to hear Dirty.
And Dirty.
That won't be played on my show.
That song sucks.
By the way, I just have to say, at the Depot last night, I saw the video of that.
They played the video of the MTV Video Music Awards, that whole little thing.
The smoochie?
Fabulous.
And you should have seen all the, you know, because it's a gay bar.
You should have seen all the gay guys' reactions to that.
It was great.
We were just all calling.
It was great.
It was fun.
Anyway.
Yeah.
Sorry.
It's okay.
Sorry to interrupt.
Um, but, uh, it lasts until, uh, 10.30, and then that's usually the point where I have to wait another 30 minutes for the Ragnarok server to come back on so I can play more Ragnarok, like the addict I am.
And, it's, it's fun.
I, I figured that's, I figured that's why you did your show Tuesday night, because that was RO maintenance night.
This, this Tuesday, though, um, I was going to be doing video game music trivia again, um, and
But I won't be able to do it because I'm going to be talking as little as possible.
You know, trying to let my lungs recover.
Which is different than the video game music trivia I'm doing because she's literally video game music trivia.
And I have like multiple question style.
So, you know, if you guess what it's from, what level it's from, give me as much as you know about this music, you'll get a point for it.
Cool.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Zero didn't make it last week, so I don't know.
He's got another week.
Thursday show, Bacon Man.
Otherwise, we may be looking for something else to put on Wednesdays.
Sorry, but if he misses two weeks in a row, I'm just... My show's fun.
If he misses two weeks in a row, I'm just going to assume he doesn't want to do it.
And Wednesday night, more pummeling on you.
We'll think of something creative for Wednesday.
I do have a backup show that's ready to go.
Not a live show, though.
We'll see.
Okay, my show, LiveWire, every Thursday, 7 o'clock, hour-long pre-show.
Usually, I've been doing now like the show before, you know, kind of replaying the show previous to it.
And this week on LiveWire, we're going to be doing kind of like a non-stop of every single LiveWire so far, all five shows, because it's my birthday and I'm not going to be here to do this.
So I'm going to have them all remixed together.
Basically, I'm just going to redo every set without my voice on it and mix together better.
So...
You know, have those and you'll get to hear them non-stop.
And at the very end, there'll be something special for you listeners who stay tuned.
It was going to be a new Loki remix, but I played that tonight.
He blew his wad.
No, it might be another one.
I don't know.
We'll see.
I would like to see a strung together mix of all... Dark's Baka in the chat room.
Hey, Baka.
DarkSakura has a show Tuesday night.
That's what she was just talking about.
Anyway.
Thursday nights, live wire, yes.
Yeah, so we got a little something special at the end there for those who tune in for the long, long set of music that's going to be there.
And also remember, because it's going to start off, I'm starting the show earlier this week, it's going to be at 6.
DarkSakura.com
Um, Livewire, the motion picture score, you know, like, kind of like a score type music.
And then last week's, which was Fuck the R.I.A., which was... That was beautiful.
It was independent, um, indie artists versus commercial artists, and it was pretty sweet.
Very cool.
Um, I, Livewire is such a great show, it's getting me into mixing, even.
And I did a mega mix that I played after Vanilla Sky one week, and, uh...
If I do it more regularly, I might find some spare time on the station to air him on a Saturday afternoon or something, but who knows.
I don't want to take any thunder away from Loki, but he's way better at it than I am.
He can do it on the fly better than I can.
And I really do, literally on the fly, because the last few weeks I've been really slacking on getting my show together.
And I literally, I'm working on the show until like the last three seconds.
Literally, so.
Alright, so Orange Lounge Radio, live programming every Sunday through Thursday night.
Well, Wednesdays are questionable recently, but we'll see.
We're going to work on that.
Anyway, as promised, you guys can ask us questions now.
It's Ask Orange Lounge.
So if you want to ask us a question...
Head on to our chat room, www.callybomani.com Click on Orange Lounge and click on chat.
And you can ask myself, Loki, or Jamie any question you want.
It's one of our favorite segments to do on this show, especially when we're desperate for filler material, which is often.
Especially in a slow Bomani News Week as it has been lately.
What day of the week is Max 2 supposed to come out?
It's the 24th, right?
That's a Wednesday.
We might be doing something, um, we'll have to do something the day that Max 2 comes out, just to add that in there.
Anyway, let's talk about Orange Lounge, or ask Orange Lounge.
Let's ask Orange Lounge some stupid question.
Who will get yelled at this week on Orange Lounge, asks the same man.
I like cheese.
I like milk.
They give me gas.
All right.
I'm going to do something, by the way.
What?
That I haven't done in a year.
You're going to eat bacon?
Two years.
I'm going to eat bacon.
His bacon is yummy.
Now I know why I don't eat pork anymore.
I'm just hungry and sick.
First question.
He tastes like murder.
EvilNaoki2DX.
Oh.
It's a shameless plug.
It's not an ask question.
It's just a shameless plug.
Here it is.
Japan Town Anime Fair is this weekend at San Francisco's Japan Town.
It's at the Radisson Miyako Hotel.
I probably... Miyako.
Sorry, I'm white.
And the Best Western Miyako Inn.
Only $12 for the weekend or $8 for one day.
You want more info?
www.jtaf.com for more info.
Let me know if you need me to work.
I will.
I'll cosplay there.
All right.
In my bike and costume.
23rd Magus.
Loki, how would you go about setting an initial D machine on fire?
I need help on my technique.
Gas.
Fire.
Fire.
I don't need to eat any more bacon, I think my mouth is catching SARS or something I'm gonna have some more V8, here, hold this
So gasoline and a match.
Yeah.
That would be my advice, too.
Late at night when no one's working, you have to excuse me, I have a mouth full of bacon.
Or if you want, what you should do is pour gas over the circuitry and then leave it, you know, so when they turn it on and the game boots up, then it catches on fire and blows up.
Well, fine.
Yeah.
Better than that.
Just go in the little cabinet where you sit in to play the game and take a dump.
It's worse than setting the machine on fire.
They need that blue napalm stuff that we had when we went camping.
Because that stuff is cool.
Jason, our friend Jason, would like to know, he says, although I can't hear the answer, why?
Why aren't you listening?
Why?
What is wrong with you?
He'd like to ask Orange Lounge, why does this weekend feel so angsty like?
Baka says, I love Orange Lounge
Aw, how nice.
There was no question there, though.
What did you get?
What were you talking about?
Hey, what did you get?
He, he, silly me.
I'm getting all these little bits and pieces of a message here.
No question, though.
So we'll move on to DCB.
Hi, guys.
Oh, this is interesting.
DCB wants to know every cast member's opinion on this.
Who is outright cooler, Al Roker or Bob Saget?
and which one would you rather have live at your house?
Loki.
Al Roker is the weather guy on the Today Show.
It's going to rain.
I don't watch TV, thank you.
Al Roker had his stomach stapled and now he looks really thin.
It's kind of scary.
But Bob's saying it's cool because, one, he played a stoner in Half-Baked and, two, he played this guy in Dumb and Dumberer who said,
He's shit all over my bathroom.
There's shit everywhere.
There's shit on the mirror.
There's shit here.
It was awesome.
I would also have to say that as much as I love Al Roker, Bob Saget is cooler because, yeah, I used to suck dick for coke.
Who would I rather have live at the house, though?
Al Roker.
I would rather have Al Roker live at the house.
Why?
Bob Saget used to clean up everything.
But Al Roker can predict the weather.
Yeah, right, uh-huh.
Like, he can predict his diet.
You know what, it doesn't matter which one's chosen, because the moment they step foot in my house legally, I can shoot them.
Did you hear, now, did you hear about this, Jamie, about this news story about the guy who tried to rob the bank, and he had an explosive collar around his neck?
I know, that was cool!
Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
Maple speaks and is asking us a question.
Gasp.
First, he wants to know, how do I go about listening?
Well, it's easy.
You know what?
If you're here, you're obviously listening.
But in case you forget, you can always go to, and I'll send this over private message to Maple, just in case he really isn't listening.
You can go to our website.
It's at orangelounge.com.
DarkSakura.Sky.CX, but not for much longer.
Hopefully only one more week on that.
Right?
Right, kids?
Hey, someone was supposed to be working on that website.
Yeah, well, it didn't happen.
I was too busy sucking debt for Coke.
You're a Coke head.
See, I told you that it looks like a drug mark.
Diet Coke!
Anyway, Mabel would also like to know, why am I so cool?
He ate a nasty piece of the bacon.
Loki choked on bacon when I asked that question.
No, it wasn't a choke on bacon.
It was a piece of the seasoning stuff I got.
And there was like nice crunchy charcoal-y taste.
I was like, oh, it's nasty bacon.
Oh, water.
Loki's got that nasty bacon.
Mabel wants to know why he's so cool.
If you got the ice cubes out of your pants, maybe you wouldn't be.
I like that answer.
I'm done with the bacon.
Bacon is done.
Maple's cool because he's really laid back.
He's a laid back guy.
I like that.
Alright.
Moving on.
John Fields would like to know, little kids that run across the DDR pads, what would you do to them if you didn't get in trouble for it?
Trip them.
I do all the time.
Um, I would, um, push them down a flight of stairs.
I would hang them by hooks through their skin on their back, and then I'd pour hot oil on their back, and then after they kept screaming, I'd stick sharp needles through their chin and through the sides of their cheeks, and then through their chest.
No, tell us how you really feel.
Of course, I was taken from, uh, Ichi the Killer, awesome movie.
Then I'd cut off their nipples.
and Baka.
Baka would like to admit he is random.
We figured that out.
Baka would also like us to define its definition time.
Define angst.
Alright.
Do this, Rob.
Go pull up Internet Explorer.
Type in www.dictionary.com
Type in the word angst.
Angst, by definition.
A feeling of anxiety or apprehension often accompanied by depression.
That's what angst means.
And now you know.
And knowing is half the battle.
Go Joe.
Now this, well here's the second part.
Define Fahud Lagas.
That's the sound you make after I kick your ass.
That's the sound of Jamie's leg going right at your balls.
That's my Japanese porn star name.
My Japanese porn star name.
See, you don't know it's me because I'm all mosaicked out, but that's me.
I'm a stunt cock.
We're out of questions.
Does anybody in the room have a question for somebody else?
Dear Chatroom, why do I own you so much for free?
Dear Chatroom, I look at my PayPal account every day and there's no other money in there.
Why isn't anyone giving me money?
NightmareHunter underscore, or Nightmare underscore Hunter.
Why won't any of you let me pimp you out?
We got questions.
We're saved.
Okay.
Maple would like to know, only who can prevent forest fires?
Not me.
Shit, I start them.
Actually, I actually used to live, or I kind of live, we kind of live in the middle of a forest, right?
And there was that fire just two blocks down the street a couple weeks ago.
So the fire department can prevent forest fires from consuming your home.
Because if they hadn't acted so fast, we could have been dead.
No, we were at work.
If a bear tried to prevent forest fires, he would just get consumed in the flames and die.
Only God can prevent forest fires.
Start praying, children.
All of a sudden, this is a religious show.
I know Live365 had a lot of religious stations, but shit.
You know, we need to do that thing where we go on to other Live365 stations, like the Christian Rock channels and things like that, and make fun of them.
Listen to them and make fun of them.
Maybe another time.
I can do that.
DCB would like to know, why do women have boobs?
He has an answer, though, too.
So you have something to look at when you're talking to them.
Family guy.
If you could see Jamie's face.
I'm trying not to laugh.
See...
We have cushioning where you guys have targets.
Think about it.
I don't... Why do women have boobs?
I mean, obviously the breast milk's there.
But they don't have to be, you know, so big some of the times.
I mean, babies don't drink that much.
Estrogen!
Hello?
Hello?
Yeah, but still.
I'm talking like Jerry Springer boobs.
Yeah, but why do people get the boobs off?
What I don't understand is my nuts aren't that big, so I mean.
Yeah, that's true.
Why can't my nuts be as big as women's boobs?
Because that would really hurt.
Having boobs does not hurt unless you have really big boobs and then your back hurts all the time.
I mean, I'm not even going to get started on that one.
Okay, I know I have big boobs.
I'm... You have nice boobs.
You have nice boobs.
Don't look at my boobs.
It's okay.
He's, you know, gay, so... Okay.
Yeah.
But... Ah!
No, you have a boob fixation.
But...
I would say that when you get into the double D's, there were these women at my elementary school.
I was so afraid of them because they had boobs that were as big as me when I was five.
And that's the time to go save up your money and go get a boob job because that's too heavy.
When you have boobs large enough to hold Matrix babies in them, that's when you have to be concerned.
Actually, I'm not kidding.
They were that large.
The triple, like, the ones that get, like, the triple G or... I didn't get, like, when I watched Geraldo one day, these women were, like, expanding themselves as novelty models.
What the hell's the point of a, you know, why don't they, like, add, like, squirrel... To G size.
Squirrel tails or something like that, you know, something funny.
Claws.
And the people with small boobs who, you know, want big boobs, you know what, be happy with what you have, because having big boobs isn't everything, except you get a lot more dates.
What is the best racist joke you know of?
I'll tell a Helen Keller joke.
Those are funny.
How do Helen Keller's parents punish her?
by rearranging the furniture.
It's funny because she's blind.
That's not really racist, but you know.
A deaf joke, okay.
Of course I learned this joke from a deaf person.
Three people were, there was a big conference and a deaf guy was sitting with an American guy and there was a Russian guy and a Mexican guy.
No, I'm not saying that.
Cuban guy.
And Cuban guy stands up and walks over to a window.
He takes a puff of a cigar and throws it out the window.
And the deaf guy signs to him, you know, why did you throw the cigar out the window?
He's like, oh, it's pretty.
Cigars in Cuba, you know, hey, Cuban cigars.
So the deaf guy just sits back and, you know, goes along with watching the conference, you know.
And then the Russian guy gets up and takes a big swig of vodka and throws a bottle out the window.
He's like, well, why did you throw the vodka out the window?
It's pretty vodka in Russia, you know.
Russia, Vodka.
So, deaf guy's sitting there, he's thinking.
So he goes up and opens the window, picks up the American guy and throws him out the window.
He's like, where'd you do that?
Plenty of hearing people in America.
I have a gay joke.
How do you make a gay guy scream twice?
Fuck him in the ass and then wipe your cock on the curtains.
Um, Mabel would also like to know, um, when you were talking about big boobs, were you making fun of me being fat?
I don't know how he gets fat out of that, but... Yes.
Yes, we were.
Do your boobs produce milk?
Do you drink a lot of breast milk?
Do you go move?
You know they have lactation pads that you can put in your bra now.
We should get you some.
Now that's making fun, see?
Why are people so, you know... Why are people self-conscious?
I don't know.
It's like you have your own creamer.
It's awesome.
Well, you know, I would be self-conscious.
Okay.
First of all, if you've never... That's the other reason why I'm not having children.
I can't even find... After sitting for 30 minutes listening to my stepsister telling me about what it feels like to lactate, no children for me, thank you.
I'll come back to Mabel's last question a little bit.
Nince would like to say, not a question, but a comment.
If only God can prevent forest fires, well, then they'll always start.
Thank you.
You da funny.
Rice Princess is asking when we're going to update the damn website, because she doesn't want to plug it if it's not updated.
We've made steps to get a new website constructed, but it's just coming along slowly.
Of course.
We need to have it done soon, though.
I know we do.
So hopefully this week.
I feel like an alien is going to pop out of my stomach.
You're going to be okay, though, right?
See, I'm immune to the pork and grease.
John Fields says, Should Weird Al do a parody of a Linkin Park song?
Yes.
No.
Yes.
Has he?
What?
Angry White Boy Polka.
Is Linkin Park in there?
Might be.
Okay.
Gur would like to know, why is it so hard to get rid of hiccups?
I don't know.
Why is it so hard to get rid of Mexicans?
Thank you for answering two questions and one there with Naples joke as well.
Thank you.
I just thought I'd like to address the other comment there.
I don't know.
I'm not really racist.
I just play one on the radio.
Okay.
Maple's last question.
Why aren't you accepting any more questions?
Because, kids, it's the end of the show.
And Ask Orange Lounge is now finished.
Yeah, but Rice Princess, I'm not racist.
I hate everyone equally, see?
Ask Orange Lounge is now over and done.
Let's not shoot a dead horse.
Let's get on to the next segment.
I'm going to puke from the pork.
The pork is really nasty.
Okay.
Um, final thoughts?
Loki.
Thank God the pork is gone.
I'm not eating any more bacon for a while.
My final thought is, um, I hate Walmart.
No, I'm not going to get over it.
Now I remember why I gave up pork.
I'm also very sad because I just spent $340 on arcade buttons.
That is sad.
Final word of the show.
I ought to take it myself.
I'll give it to Jamie.
I know she always likes to have the final word.
Here it is.
The final word of the evening is puce.
You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
Orange Lounge Radio is hosted by Dark Sakura, Sky, and Loki.
We expect you a nice play again.
And now, here's your fortune cookie message of the day.
Stop, collaborate and listen, BK's back with my brand new invention, something grabs a hold of me tightly, flow like a harpoon, daily and nightly, would it ever stop you, I don't know, turn on the light, and I'll go to the extreme.
I rock a mic like a vandal Light up a stage and watch me jump like a candle Damn, yeah, I'm kicking that boom I'm poisonous like a poisonous mushroom If there is a problem, yo, I'll solve it Check out the hook while my DJ revolves it Ice, ice, baby, too cold, too cold Ice, ice, baby, too cold, too cold
Thank you for watching!

Thanks for listening and we'll see you next week.
I like this song.
This reminds me of Ferris Bueller's Day Off.
Yeah, that's why DCB sent this song to me, because it reminds him of Ferris Bueller's Day Off.
That movie is so cool.
Anyway, yes, hi, welcome to the Orange Lounge Radio Afterbirth.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
We went to Walmart and bought Trivial Pursuit, the 20th anniversary edition, and brought it home and played.
It was me, Brad, Irene, Loki, and Nellie, Loki's girlfriend.
We were all playing.
And hilarity.
It was absolutely hilarious.
We got some of the most funniest answers ever.
Like, I was asking Nellie a question.
I was trying to get everybody's attention because everybody was talking.
I wanted to ask a question, so I went, which?
And I was like, which?
Like, I was starting the question, which one of the... And Irene's all, don't call her a witch.
This is funny, he had to be there.
And then we learned that there is a cat exhibit at the local aquarium.
And we also learned that Stephen King directed E.T.
I'm going to get punched in the face for that one, but that's okay.
I gotta fuck you, Rob.
I gotta fuck you.
I'm sorry, what?
What, Jamie?
Jamie has clean clothes, she's celebrating.
I can smell clean clothes because the fans blow and the clean clothes smell this way.
Smells like clean clotheness.
Thank you all for listening to and supporting Orange Lounge Radio.
We do appreciate it.
It's very nice of you.
I think we're pretty much done.
Jamie, do you have anything you want to say?
Get your ass over here.
Who needs potpourri when you can have clean laundry?
Sprinkle detergent all over your house.
No, you want to know get away the clean clothes?
Or not really clean clothes, but give it... Give the impression of clean clothes?
Rubber dryer sheet on yourself.
That's so ghetto.
That's like something you'd hear on... That's like something you'd... Do you smell my butt?
Rob just smelled my butt.
I smelled your butt.
It smells April fresh.
That was beautiful.
Okay, sex, blood, violence, and bloodshed.
Well, there's this movie, Ichi the Killer, where this guy beats up this prostitute and they cut off her nipples, as I mentioned earlier, and there's lots of blood from that.
So that has sex, violence, and bloodshed.
What a lovely thought, thank you.
It's a great movie, though.
Everything with the same prostitute.
Or different prostitute, actually.
Gets her leg cut off and she's hobbling on one foot.
Funny.
Funny.
Okay.
I think we're done.
I'll be nicer when you're smarter.
Good night, everybody.
Thank you for supporting Orange Lounge Radio.
We appreciate it.
After the show tonight, we have for you guys a Dance Mania marathon.
Yay!
A whole bunch of thrown-together tracks from your favorite Dance Mania albums.
That should be exciting.
There's a whole bunch of albums in here.
I'm sure you guys will enjoy it.
Oh, I have to add one more.
I want to make sure EX4 gets in here, too.
So, Loki, say something else while I get this ready.
If you give me money, I will invite you over to play in the arcade cabinet, because it will be sweet.
But no one has given me money except for Vandalus.
And Vandalus, you're more than welcome to come over when I'm done.
Yeah, but he gave me $10.
That's alright.
Well, you're more than welcome to come over.
You're always... Woo, court!
Ah!
Change.
Yeah, but she just did laundry here, so that's more like a laundromat.
Oh yeah.
Yeah.
I'm going to use it as a piggy bank also.
It's a $60 piggy bank.
Stupid fucking coin door costs that much.
But, um...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Okay, we're going to do a Dance Mania Marathon now.

Bye, guys.
Thanks for listening.
I will fart continuously on the mic on Wednesday night.
Wednesday might just be a... If we can't get Zero to commit to a show, we might just do a live Trivial Pursuit game on air.
I know what we should call the show.
What?
I set myself on fire.
All right.
Good night, everybody.
Thanks for listening to Sporting Orange Sounds Radio.
Enjoy this Dance Mania marathon.
