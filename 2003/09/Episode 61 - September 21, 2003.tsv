8581	12727	Toto, I have a feeling we're not in Kansas anymore.
16368	21230	You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio, the Monty Talk and then some.
21931	24632	Uh, mostly the and then some part of that.
24992	29014	Orange Lounge Radio is created by a bunch of potty-mouthed adults.
29655	34417	Orange Lounge may contain sexual, perverted, and mildly retarded content.
35017	38739	You probably shouldn't let your children listen to Orange Lounge Radio.
39059	40540	Yes, I will spank your child.
40940	42661	If you're not going to do your job, goddammit, I will.
47455	49516	Well, here's to my big opening.
50016	51156	A sphincter says what?
51436	53457	I'm super, thanks for asking.
53817	56418	Oh, you little bitch troll from hell.
56438	59699	What am I doing here?
59739	60019	No.
60279	61640	Dodge this.
62080	63961	This is a tasty burger.
64181	66662	Look, you stupid bastard, you've got no arms left.
66862	67522	Yes, I have.
67962	69763	Look, there's a flesh wound.
69963	76025	Searching for a boy in high school is as useless as searching for meaning in a polyshorum.
77162	77902	Oh yeah?
78123	81424	Well, I hope your babies look like monkeys.
81644	82725	DarkSakura.
82905	83685	I've got a sniff.
84065	84606	Skye.
84706	86787	But I'm playing it for the bartender, so suffer.
87167	87687	Loki.
87947	88948	I hate you!
89368	91409	Orange Lounge Radio.
93430	96191	We are live, finally.
97592	98492	And this is episode number 61.
100598	101879	Well, at least a fraction of it.
102380	105142	The first 20 minutes is gone forever, but that's okay, we didn't do them.
106404	113350	For September the 21st of 2003, you're tuned into the Bomani Scene's most Comcast-hating radio station of all things B-Money.
114271	116113	My name is Rob Roberts, but you might know me as Sky.
116574	118355	Joining me as always are my awesome co-hosts.
118415	121018	In this corner, the happiest bunny on the farm is Jamie Summers.
121038	122279	You know her better as Dark Sakura.
122920	123701	Get that thing out of my face.
125279	127260	She's too busy playing Dance Summit right now.
127280	130081	Well, um, you know, we have other things going on, like the show.
130162	131202	That's more important.
131722	132823	The game will have to come later.
134083	136125	Uh, in that corner, it's Mother.
136225	137945	Say hello to her tech, Master Loki.
139006	139726	Hello!
139746	142948	You chance her up late playing that damn game.
142968	144629	Well, we had to do something without a show.
147489	148669	Why is it snowing indoors?
149470	150150	Oh, it's not outdoors.
150170	151010	Why is it snowing?
151110	151610	It's petals.
151690	153311	Oh, God, I thought you were talking about real life.
153371	154311	I was like, what the hell?
154431	155551	Is the ceiling caving in?
156412	158092	Yes, Rob, it's snowing outside.
158132	160253	That, you know, special 100 degrees snow.
162114	163074	We know.
163874	164914	Turn it off.
166635	168756	No, you didn't want to talk when you had the mic.
168916	169716	So, meh.
175871	182911	I like Dance Summit Okay, next Alright We're not going to take an opening break tonight We're just going to go right into the show
184232	186374	Yeah, you had a 20 minute opening break before the show, so deal.
187875	191117	So, hello and welcome to Orange Lounge Radio episode number 61.
192358	193599	We're going to get right into it.
194279	199643	If you want to join our chat room, www.callybomani.com, click on Orange Lounge and click on chat.
200523	202745	If we're a little dazed, you just have to forgive us.
202805	205386	It's taking us a minute to kind of get back in the groove here.
205487	206187	Trying to do the show.
206247	207268	Hey, get in the groove.
207288	208428	I made a DDR.
208989	209189	No.
210010	212511	Do you want to... Ow!
212751	212972	Okay.
213872	214733	Get out the whip, babe.
214994	215535	All right.
216075	218238	If you want to visit our... We'll come out later, I'm sure.
218258	227311	If you want to visit our webcam, because we have a lot of guests in the studio tonight, go to our chat room and they'll tell you how to get to the webcam because we're not giving out the URL here because that's incentive to go to the chat.
228112	228473	Okay.
229534	232277	Let's go around and say who's here tonight, because we have a lot of guests here.
232297	234499	So you know DarkSakura and Loki, of course, by now.
234659	235260	We also have.
235480	235900	Say hello.
236701	238763	It's Puppy over here.
238863	240305	Tepp Puppy is in the house.
240865	243247	Yes, after... Be careful with that!
244328	245249	If you break something...
246090	253676	Also with us tonight, say hello to, and this is somebody who's new, never been to the show, say hello to Violet Hypergirl Hello, how are you?
254836	264784	She brought her whip and everything, so she's going to, oh hello Not in the house, not in the house dear, unless it's in the bedroom Wait, you're 18 now, huh?
267946	269187	When's your first movie coming out?
269247	273130	I'm just kidding It's not going to happen with me, don't worry I already went clubbing, so yeah
274254	274935	Ah, you went clubbing.
274955	278077	Where'd you go?
278117	287203	We went with Randy, Yellow Jacket Boy, also known as DJ Taka on the boards, or Taka Shonen, as you guys might know him on Calibumani.
288084	293848	We also went with Aori, we went with BJ, and we went with Psycho Joe.
294669	295029	Wow.
296450	296870	Yeah.
297531	300112	Apparently clubbing is a place where everyone's either drunk or high.
301413	302074	Not when I go.
302194	302934	Well, drunk maybe.
304648	305469	I get drunk a lot.
305569	306249	I don't get high.
306309	306869	I don't do that.
307429	308470	I don't endorse weed.
308810	312371	Now, drunk on the other hand, that's different.
312771	314312	Yeah, drunk on the other hand, completely different story.
316252	320114	Okay, I'm noticing we're still having some connection stability issues.
320194	323795	Like, our chat room's running fine, but the station seems to be having...
325071	325851	Thanks for watching!
344718	372120	California, Oregon, Washington all had an outage on Comcast so we all went down for about 10 minutes but for some reason some areas went down for an hour and we were one of those lucky areas so anyway bear with us the show will be played back in its entirety on Wednesday and Thursday of course the webcam is also being switched over to one minute refresh because of the traffic on the net right now because of this Comcast outage so I'm switching it over to one minute refresh
373553	378175	I think the buffer, introduce yourself one more time, dear, because I think the buffer hit right when you were introducing yourself.
379415	381316	Hello, it's VHG.
382036	383236	Yeah, okay.
383376	384917	Hi.
385077	385417	All right.
388658	389858	Do you need to let out a burp, Jamie?
389958	390599	Just let it out.
390899	391599	Let it out, girl.
392919	394720	I'm going to exercise the burp.
395380	398601	My burp is stuck in my esophagus.
399641	401042	Yeah, pat her on the back like a baby.
402688	409411	I couldn't help because it's like my throat is coated in Pepsi vanilla.
430779	432300	You're like a gassy baby right now.
434862	443107	I knew you were full of hot gas, but... I cannot put that in my hair.
444608	444868	No.
446449	448130	VHG, do not give her the whip.
448170	448791	That's bad.
449311	450372	She doesn't need the whip.
451152	452453	We still have more people to introduce.
452673	456196	We have a guy here from halfway across America we haven't even said hello to yet.
456276	457196	So let's get over here.
458437	459458	Let's go around the couch here.
460313	460894	Say hello.
462555	462955	Hello.
463455	463916	Hi, Joey.
463956	464316	How are you?
464476	464796	I'm good.
464836	465517	You're back!
466077	466598	I'm back.
466638	470080	Joey played his very first game of DDR today.
470240	470601	I did.
470801	477446	This is exciting that one year into Orange Lounge Radio, we can still find DDR noobs and kind of like follow them along as they're getting into DDR.
477466	478106	It's so cute.
481549	483991	Dude, Matt built a ferret launcher.
484011	484611	That's awesome.
484631	487353	You missed it.
487673	488554	Oh, you booked it?
488754	489515	It wasn't that good anyway.
493953	494794	The burp of all burps.
495075	495395	Ferret.
495636	495956	Ferret.
496337	497078	I need the ferret.
497699	498800	Okay.
499221	499682	I need one.
500983	501885	Let's see who else is here.
501905	502285	There he is.
505080	505801	Yeah, baby.
506261	507101	Pass it on.
507942	508723	And here we go.
509083	512305	All the way from Kansas is Shane.
512705	513286	Hi, Shane.
513506	513986	Hi, Rob.
514326	514827	How are you?
514947	515267	Good.
515747	517709	And what's your name online for people that might know you?
517849	518970	Oh, nobody knows me online.
521491	522372	I know you online.
522392	524613	Then it'd be Zex and Shad.
525434	528216	Did you say you posted on some Kansas City board or something?
529135	530496	Yeah, Miklatov.
530656	531477	But you posted Shane?
532197	533398	No, I posted Miklatov.
533678	533898	Oh, okay.
534659	536199	Well, hello and welcome to California.
536340	536640	Thank you.
536960	538441	What brings you to California this week?
538721	540722	Family business and to get away from school.
541282	541623	Right on.
541843	542243	Good deal.
542603	544765	And what do you think so far of California?
544785	545905	We're a little crazy here, huh?
546365	546986	Just a little.
547046	548066	The ferrets flying.
549367	550128	And the burping.
550148	552609	No show for 20 minutes.
555811	559593	And it's nice to find Dance Summit, like, people that like it.
559633	561454	Dance Summit was pretty cool, I've got to admit.
561474	563956	That's what we were kind of filling in our downtime with, so that was fun.
564636	566537	So, a big hello to you, thank you for being here.
566657	567057	Thank you.
567117	573181	This is neat, because just like, what, two weeks ago we had John Fields here all the way from, like, way back east, Connecticut.
573801	574101	New York.
574121	575042	New York.
576082	583486	And, um, he came... Yeah, all the way from Connecticut, and now here we have another fan all the way from Kansas.
583526	584527	So this is cool, I like this.
586866	593368	Alright, and of course, in the corner, where the freshman belongs is... 23rd Vegas.
593388	595169	Where's my fucking joke book, Rob?
595669	596029	Shit.
600031	602532	The problem with your joke book is it's only about two pages long.
602572	603192	I think I have it.
603672	604852	I'm just kidding.
605413	607773	Oh, he did not just go there.
608854	611635	No, no, Rob, Rob, it's more than two pages long.
611675	613355	It's five pages long in 40-point font.
616443	616703	Ouch.
618024	621007	I knew there was a reason you're always here for witty commentary.
622428	622688	Alright.
624750	628733	So, okay, everybody calm down for a minute.
629154	632777	We've had a little bit of chaos in the beginning of the show here.
633197	637381	I thought we'd kick off the show like we usually do, our all favorite game.
638342	639883	How was your week and how was your day?
640223	644706	I want to play this because of course we have some out of town folks here that probably have a lot they want to say about California.
645267	647168	And I certainly have a lot to say.
647808	651190	So let's, I actually have Bomani related stories to tell this week too.
651711	652411	No way, way.
654372	655913	So we're going to start with Jamie.
657494	659015	Hi.
661177	662378	Wait, wait, hold on, hold on.
662398	663238	I got to say it.
665333	666674	Bradley gets a total zing.
666734	672939	Arcadian42 in the chat room, he says, and 23 Magus' joke book, it's printed on recycled paper, just like the material.
672959	678003	I can't ye.
679465	680325	That was beautiful.
680826	681626	That was beautiful.
682947	687551	Oh, I thought that it was recycled, like, you know, like recycled toilet paper.
689293	691955	It's written on five sheets of toilet paper.
693055	694056	Anyway, Jamie, how was your day?
694076	694517	How was your week?
694897	695698	My week sucked.
697680	700183	I worked, and Dan lives off in Texas.
702686	706050	He manages an unnamed video game store.
706070	707292	Unnamed?
707352	708313	Unnamed.
709696	718220	and this unnamed series of video game stores had a conference in an unnamed state named Texas.
719480	720181	It's named now.
720921	722062	You killed the ferret!
723282	724703	I killed the ferret.
724803	726264	Where'd it go?
726344	726644	Okay.
727384	728425	Give me the ferret.
729045	729846	Give me my baby.
729866	731526	I want this baby.
732107	732787	I don't want it now.
735248	736069	Okay, anyway.
737276	743577	Anyway, um, so I've been really, like, by myself all week, and it sucked.
744818	750059	And I played some, played some Phantasy Star.
750539	754900	I played some, yeah, my new addiction, sort of, is Phantasy Star Online.
756680	758020	Which I'm playing on the Xbox.
759480	761461	Because I gave up playing it on the GameCube.
761901	764762	In response to Naoki in the chatroom, yes, you must get Disgaea.
765482	766102	Yes, you will.
766622	766862	And it's...
768740	770982	Ooh, Jamie, okay, what are we looking at?
771642	772382	What are we looking at?
774204	775905	I don't think I wanna know what's in that jug.
776345	779247	They're growing a mutant in this bottle of orange juice.
782569	786552	It expired in July, and I got it in the fridge today.
787953	788714	Yuck.
788754	791255	Might I add, I was about to pour myself a glass.
794998	796759	But penicillin is good for you.
796819	798200	It's an antibiotic.
798781	799141	Yeah, right.
799922	800782	In rare form.
801943	803845	Let me shift my position here.
804545	805886	I'm still hiding from the webcam.
807407	808888	Anyway, what is that?
813872	814132	All right.
814977	816698	Richie, they do not look like maids.
817379	818019	Get over it.
818340	818700	Please.
822463	822763	Anyway.
822783	826886	Okay, the Caphras look stupid now, by the way.
827847	838375	But anyway, so I played like a whole bunch of Ragnarok online and they implemented the Komodo patch, which I made it there walking with my assassin.
841806	845589	Anyway, with the judicious use of fly wings to teleport.
847370	856618	And then I found out that with all the free wharfs, it only cost me like 2,000 zenny to get there with my merchant.
856738	862723	So I took my merchant there, bought 60,000 steel arrows, and doubled all of my money.
863383	866606	And then I started a guild named Battle Royale on my archer.
868214	873559	Anyway, um, so yeah, my week's been, like, full of gaming, and then full of some really stupid crappy stress.
873899	875801	I didn't touch a single Bermondi game all weekend.
877535	877875	All week.
879936	880516	You know what?
880556	884158	The past four weeks we've done this segment, you haven't touched a Bermuda game.
885278	885939	I am next week.
886379	887539	Max 2 is coming out this week.
887559	888440	Do you plan on playing it?
888540	889580	I'm going to play it, yeah.
890240	897503	I've still got the interestingly acquired dance pad at my house.
898904	900865	You mean my dance pad?
901525	902886	It's been at my house for 30 days.
902946	904246	Hey, watch it, lady.
904346	905747	I don't like where you're going with that.
906896	907337	I'm kidding.
907957	910058	It's not paying rent either, so evict it already.
910999	911419	I'm kidding.
911879	913300	You know I give it back when you ask for it.
914281	915322	Provided we don't break up.
917783	922106	Because that's how I got it in the first place.
922886	925828	And then I found out that I'm 69% male on my live show.
928590	929231	Which is funny.
932248	934689	Excuse me, but I don't have balls to scratch, thank you.
935749	936329	Okay, then.
938650	939090	No!
943791	946392	For those in here, Magus, he said, I thought they were on the upper body.
947753	948793	Flying carrot!
952674	954414	This thing hurts, by the way, when you hit people with it.
955055	955715	My, my...
958524	964650	I have found out that this thing that I have my hair wrapped up in hurts really hard if you get whapped with it.
965391	965972	What about the whip?
966973	968334	Whips hurt too, but this hurts more.
968554	969075	Oh, okay.
969916	970556	Yeah, where's the whip?
975121	978485	Anyway, I downloaded a bunch of crap from my computer.
980577	1009720	and she's also the most wonderful sister in the world because she's working on darksakura.com and by the way we did some work for roleplay.darksakura.com which should be a few more forms have been added on so everybody has to sign up for it now and then that's it so that was your day and your week Dan came home today
1010731	1011952	And he might be leaving early tonight.
1012532	1012813	Maybe.
1014294	1014634	Maybe.
1014974	1017777	Because you might have to plan for a long evening.
1018537	1022000	Dan came home tonight, and we're going to go get food, but I ate.
1023501	1027324	I had a salad and blue potato chips, which I'm going to share with everyone.
1027344	1027945	Mmm, yum.
1028605	1029006	Blue.
1029086	1029966	Do they taste like blue?
1030307	1032128	They taste like blue, amazingly enough.
1032608	1032889	Awesome.
1033269	1035331	They taste very rugged, like blue.
1035351	1036311	Rugged and blue.
1037552	1038193	Rugged and blue.
1039315	1043896	Just a reminder, you guys, the chat room is kind of bitching about things going up and down.
1044236	1045417	We're doing the best we can.
1046077	1048038	Address those cards and letters to Comcast.
1048098	1053819	DDArcoholic in the chat room says, Comcast is so freaking unreliable, it should be illegal to run a business the way they do.
1053919	1055140	And I tend to agree.
1055280	1056360	It's pretty sad.
1056660	1058341	It's even worse than Scandia's business.
1058461	1060141	It's worse than Roseville, Golf Land.
1062242	1065883	A moment of silence, like, I can't believe he just went there.
1068383	1071004	I worked at Arcades, I know what's going on.
1071404	1071705	Anyway.
1073926	1075106	Um, Loki!
1077207	1078508	How was your week, how was your day?
1080649	1081309	He's doing dishes.
1081329	1082049	Mid-show!
1084190	1089893	Microphone to the... Alright, anyways.
1089913	1094555	Let's see, this week was expensive.
1095455	1096856	It involved buying things.
1097892	1099353	There's a lot of wood outside.
1102876	1104297	Loki bought some stiff wood.
1106498	1112243	Yes, I bought eight nice sheets of MDF for the arcade cabinet.
1113103	1114925	I'm working on finishing my pads.
1114985	1115805	I'm almost done.
1115865	1118047	I've got one of them almost done.
1118267	1118567	It was...
1120785	1125186	I'm starting the wiring on it, but I, yeah, I haven't gotten around to it.
1125726	1129847	But anyway, starting the wiring on one of the pads, the other pad needs to be done, probably be done this week.
1131487	1134788	Arcade stuff, I'm getting the rest of my buttons pretty soon.
1135748	1141009	I ordered an Atari 2600 trackball, it's going to be hacked into turntables for 2DX.
1141769	1145070	So you're turning an Atari 2600 trackball into a 2DX controller?
1145692	1150516	No, the optical controls for it are going to be for the turntables for 2DX.
1151997	1155340	But then I have these two spinners here.
1155440	1157361	I realize they're pretty useless now.
1158822	1159243	Yeah.
1160243	1161785	Because I can't use them.
1164367	1165427	It's because it's a B-movie.
1166228	1166768	But anyways...
1169318	1177286	So, I bought a bunch of shit, and I spent a lot of money, and now I have to scrimp for like a few weeks, and then, um, what else did I do?
1182190	1183952	I can't even see the screen.
1184753	1186434	It's for the best, Loki, don't worry about it.
1189297	1191998	Our chatroom is bitchy tonight.
1192898	1199120	Man, you robbed them of 20 minutes of Orange Lounge and they're just going, freaking claws out.
1200060	1206542	I think Loki's kicking someone from the chatroom.
1206682	1208043	And of course he's under my name.
1208523	1209963	Hey, be nice.
1211043	1212124	That was under me.
1212164	1213444	You did that under my name.
1214184	1215045	That's so mean.
1215085	1215985	Why did you do that?
1217498	1219920	I didn't do it, and Jamie knows it, and she's my witness.
1220961	1222342	I said not to.
1222362	1223083	I didn't do it!
1224084	1224844	That's Rob.
1226566	1228948	My God, I said not to do that.
1229689	1231951	I'm sorry, I'm going to kick him.
1232051	1232871	Where's my foot?
1235093	1235874	That's pretty bad.
1238036	1239157	Smell the shoe!
1239957	1240818	Mine smells worse.
1240938	1243761	Okay, anyway, so what else did I do this week?
1246025	1247647	Will somebody invite her back, please?
1249988	1251169	Anyway, go ahead.
1251289	1251849	Yeah.
1252350	1256252	So, um... What else?
1256272	1258353	I don't know, I didn't do too much this week.
1258393	1268620	It's pretty much just working on the stupid pads and then, you know, just sitting at my desk, rotting away, and... At one point I was trying to... I didn't know how I was going to hook up the pads to, like, the, um...
1282754	1283855	I know I'm hilarious.
1284015	1288157	Okay, if you're not in our chat room tonight, you're missing out.
1288858	1294782	I'm sorry that we're so one-sided, but our chat room is so bitchy tonight.
1294842	1295582	It's beautiful.
1295942	1296743	You must be there.
1297763	1304588	www.callybomani.com Click on Orange Lounge and click on chat.
1306489	1307249	Yeah, anyways, so...
1314226	1315026	Moving on.
1315827	1316167	Yes.
1317328	1318388	Yeah, that's pretty much my week.
1318849	1319129	Yeah.
1320710	1322311	Just a lot of nothing.
1324433	1327995	Oh, and I found a lot of rotted stuff in our fridge, which I cleaned out.
1329456	1330056	Not bad, huh?
1330837	1331077	Yeah.
1331517	1331738	Hmm.
1334219	1334560	That's it.
1335420	1335720	I'm done.
1336221	1336501	All right.
1337881	1341444	But then again, you know, if Marin wants me to, I can keep talking all night long.
1341464	1344506	I can never stop.
1345387	1346748	I'll talk about my week and my day.
1347529	1348049	Yeah, you do that.
1348209	1351932	My week was, there wasn't really a lot to it.
1352032	1354374	Work, sleep, play, you know, type thing, whatever.
1355695	1358197	There was that, and then, but this weekend, this is cool.
1358737	1361520	Yesterday, yesterday I went to Reno.
1363330	1369303	Reno is kind of a shithole in some ways, but I got to gamble, which is fun because I love gambling.
1370426	1370706	I think...
1372458	1374039	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1395393	1396494	I really, really wanted it.
1397255	1398356	That was real wise.
1398436	1398716	Anyway.
1399237	1406604	But not only did we gamble, we went around and played some different DDR machines, because, you know, in a town like Vegas or Reno, every casino's got a DDR machine, right?
1406965	1411429	So we went to the El Dorado, and they have, get this, a Solo 4th Plus.
1412710	1413651	Those are so rare.
1413932	1414933	It was godly.
1415093	1416494	I was so happy to play it.
1416574	1417055	I mean, like...
1418450	1422733	How often do you see a 4th Plus these days, let alone a solo 4th Plus I could play?
1422853	1428978	And you know, you know, I fired that fucker up and I played solo Conga Feelin' first song.
1429979	1431380	Six-panel Conga Feelin'.
1432160	1432721	It's awesome.
1433701	1435302	And I did some freestyle, too.
1435322	1435783	That was fun.
1435863	1437044	I went with the Ice Princess.
1438285	1440126	I did some loose freestyle, too.
1440346	1442147	Aaron's ears just perked up when you said that.
1442167	1443829	I did freestyle.
1443849	1443949	Yes, I...
1445240	1446560	I did some great freestyle.
1446820	1448501	I did a freestyle to the 7 jump.
1448901	1450401	I did a freestyle to the 7 jump.
1450521	1450921	It ruled.
1455682	1456002	Okay.
1459083	1459523	Oh, I know.
1460783	1462803	Anyway, I'm not going AZN.
1462843	1464264	I haven't started playing Initial D yet.
1467804	1470945	Nothing flows Initial D. Just everything.
1473464	1476827	Let's see, and then, uh, Rito is fourth plus, what else did we play in Rito?
1477107	1489938	Oh, I got my name on the machine at Circus Circus, because, like, then I made it, like, my goal, like, I had to go put my initials somewhere in every machine that I could find, because, like, I have a big ego or something, and, like, I feel the need to spread my sky germs everywhere.
1491900	1492701	Oh, heaven forbid.
1492861	1496904	So, anyway, that was pretty much my week, my day in a nutshell.
1497845	1498386	Yeah, yeah.
1500043	1505205	So if EvilMaliki2DX says he humped that machine, so I humped it too, so we kind of had sex.
1508266	1509327	I hope you wore a condom.
1511648	1512048	Oh boy.
1513428	1520371	I danced to Oh Nick Please Not So Quick too, because to play six panel erotic is just beautiful.
1523032	1523692	Moving on.
1523973	1527334	What was set number two in your five toilet paper sheet joke book?
1527952	1530393	Poppy, how was your day, how was your week?
1531213	1539815	Um, okay, um, this week has been, uh, stuff on campus, looking for a job, and Disgaea.
1540675	1541355	And more Disgaea.
1541835	1542535	And more Disgaea.
1543096	1543776	And more Disgaea.
1546516	1549817	No, I really don't remember anything I did the past week besides play Disgaea.
1550557	1553358	That's, and that's kind of sad, but it's time well spent.
1557814	1558755	That's a really good picture.
1560815	1562796	And none of that caught on the microphone.
1565557	1574921	A game has to be good when you hear some really disturbing jokes about a zombie and a horse wiener.
1579202	1580823	Is this something out of Magus' jokebook?
1581763	1582003	What?
1582063	1582283	No.
1582904	1583604	No, I'm serious.
1583664	1586025	It's actually part of the plot of the game.
1588550	1590971	Your ass is still on the webcam because it hasn't refreshed.
1591011	1592412	Your webcam's checking you out.
1598014	1598854	Anyway, puppy.
1600975	1607357	And then, yeah, besides the fact that I'm now settled into my apartment.
1610479	1611439	What is wrong with you people?
1613900	1614660	It's something in the air.
1614680	1615961	It's Comcast does it to you.
1618905	1619686	Tag teaming.
1619946	1621667	I feel like I'm in kindergarten again.
1623248	1625309	Okay, now we just need some whoopee cushions and we'll be set.
1625330	1627211	I was going to say, I kind of have to fart.
1628492	1629092	Kidding, kidding.
1630293	1630953	Kidding, kidding.
1633335	1637738	No, I have a, what do you call it, a cigarette lighter somewhere though.
1640060	1641441	Alright, that was it?
1642602	1642902	Alright.
1644263	1645904	Joey, do you have anything you want to share about your week and your day?
1647777	1653561	My week was filled of work and work and more work.
1654182	1655122	Kind of boring, huh?
1655723	1656563	But it pays the bills.
1658064	1662628	And let's see, this weekend I was off and didn't do a whole lot, just hung out.
1663768	1669072	And today I played my first game of DDR.
1669232	1670073	Yay!
1670153	1671114	Congratulations!
1671214	1672435	Very first time.
1673896	1674756	And what was it?
1675096	1676698	I passed...
1677418	1678078	A three-step.
1678479	1679819	Yes, you passed a three-footer.
1680220	1682861	That's a DER lingo, a three-footer.
1683041	1683682	I passed it.
1684122	1685283	That was so cool.
1685463	1686003	First try.
1686363	1688985	Anyway, other than that, that was it.
1692127	1692567	Cool deal.
1692887	1694888	And what was the three-footer you passed, do you remember?
1697930	1700251	Was it... Look.
1700752	1701452	Look into the sky?
1701612	1702753	Look to the sky, you got it.
1702793	1703493	There you go.
1704094	1704394	Good job.
1705216	1705616	to the chatroom.
1705876	1707997	Chaos, this isn't channel DDR Freak.
1708077	1712878	Mom jokes are not welcome here.
1713938	1716199	Anyway, our chatroom is so feisty tonight.
1716219	1717179	What a bunch of bitches.
1721660	1724581	Anyway, let's move on.
1726021	1729982	Andrew, Mr. Magus, tell us about your week and your day.
1732361	1738822	My week was full of bombing Japanese quizzes and putting it in locks at the ARC arcade.
1740263	1741523	I've been studying, Jamie.
1753326	1758067	And I've been working with a student association at ARC.
1759167	1761189	trying to get some machines worked on.
1761209	1764392	They're checking out the Beachhead 2000, trying to get there a place for something but money.
1765473	1769216	Most likely another DDR machine, but can't count out 5-key.
1772919	1777883	And there's a very minute chance of poppin' music, but yeah, right.
1778184	1778644	Yeah, right.
1782568	1784089	Why are you all turning it to me?
1784149	1784830	What the fuck?
1789195	1789655	No!
1791116	1794098	Anyway, let's see.
1795219	1798101	More to come in the FU, so yeah.
1799041	1801323	Oh, I can concur with that, actually.
1801643	1805505	And now, if you noticed, I saved our two guests for last, and one's on the phone right now.
1806266	1808107	Must be on a booty call, so we'll talk to Aaron.
1809528	1810068	Oh, never mind.
1811249	1811809	Never mind.
1812410	1813230	Never mind, this is Dad.
1816857	1817938	Thank you for watching!
1837242	1842392	Well, my week was full of planning for a friend, planning a birthday party for a friend.
1842552	1843814	A surprise birthday party.
1844395	1848282	Which, by the way, when we surprised her, I've never seen her turn more red until that day.
1849201	1850361	and she started crying too.
1850481	1852922	So it was a really good party and I slept over.
1853642	1860944	So I am running on about three hours of sleep, a sip of DNL, some water, some orange juice.
1860964	1861644	Don't forget the penguin mint.
1862284	1862544	Huh?
1862704	1863665	Don't forget the penguin mint.
1863745	1867966	Yeah, the penguin mint and I don't know what else I'm running on.
1868186	1869346	Hi and welcome to college.
1871106	1874287	Yeah, I feel vaguely hungry right now but it hasn't hit me yet.
1874307	1875887	I'm hungry too.
1875907	1876868	Let's get the blue chip.
1876908	1877388	No!
1882822	1908814	by the way, my apartment has two vents for those of you that don't know I'm currently in Davis right now and I will be here for the rest of the year my apartment has two vents none of which are in any of the bedrooms my toilet leaks there's a big water stain there's a water stain on my ceiling
1909758	1912539	We won't have any internet for the next two days.
1914179	1915139	Yay, no internet.
1915199	1917200	Don't get Comcast.
1917700	1918780	I don't think we have Comcast.
1918800	1921421	You're getting DSL, right?
1921501	1922481	That's not Comcast?
1922621	1924482	I don't think it's Comcast.
1924542	1925942	Ooh, they're passing around blue chips.
1926702	1929023	So he wants to finish his chip.
1929143	1930343	I'll get them in a second.
1937537	1946400	So, and now my weekend will be winding down with spending time with this crazy, insane, perverted Orange Lounge crew, which I love so very, very much.
1947440	1949401	And yes, it is true, I do have my whip.
1950701	1954662	So there will be a lot of mass bondage orgy tonight.
1955423	1955683	Mass, mass.
1955743	1956703	I heard orgy.
1957123	1957743	Okay.
1957943	1958223	All right.
1963971	1965692	Not just any orgy, Loki.
1966252	1968293	Ass bondage orgy.
1968613	1970934	Oh, I thought she said ass bondage.
1972135	1974056	I was like, is that like leather panties?
1974076	1975177	Hey, that sounds like fun.
1976157	1977037	Except for the ass part.
1977177	1978578	Ass bondage is super glue.
1981680	1982140	Right.
1983000	1984401	Mass orgy sounds great.
1985281	1985762	I'm down.
1986002	1989183	Whoa, whoa, this is a side of Loki I've never seen before.
1989563	1990364	What, mass orgy?
1992975	1995715	I've never seen him just propose a mass orgy like this.
1998376	1998836	Sorry.
1999916	2000176	Anyway.
2000796	2001557	Let's talk to Shane.
2001657	2003057	I'm not sure he was proposing it.
2003077	2004217	I think he was just agreeing with it.
2005157	2007818	I went in order of distance here, so Shane has to be last.
2008478	2009118	I'm just kidding.
2009638	2010938	So, how you doing?
2011818	2012198	I'm good.
2013399	2016339	My week sucked because we drove 1,690 miles from Kansas to get here.
2016359	2016879	You counted.
2016899	2016959	No.
2016999	2017199	Yeah.
2017219	2017319	Yeah.
2023015	2024696	Well, you don't have much else to do on the road.
2029059	2030359	You had to drive through Nevada.
2030740	2033621	Yeah, oh, and I have a serious FU to Elko later.
2034222	2035442	Oh my god, okay.
2036123	2041606	But, yeah, two days of driving, eh, family, eh, Scandia.
2042233	2043693	Had 2DX, that was pretty good.
2045034	2048055	Got AA on Dancer, yay.
2048135	2051055	Died on Yoru no Sunglassu again.
2052036	2055797	And, yeah, just relaxing, taking time off of school.
2056457	2059458	Any other interesting things you've seen in Sacramento while you've been here?
2060518	2061178	Let's see.
2062378	2063479	No, no, really, it's been pretty good.
2063499	2063839	Oh, I know.
2063859	2065259	What did you have for the first time today?
2065479	2066739	Oh, Mongolian barbecue.
2067380	2068440	That was awesome.
2069983	2072564	I burnt my tongue and it still hurts, but it was good.
2074985	2079967	We took them to one of the Mongolians that isn't even like one of the really good ones we always go to.
2080007	2082188	We took them to that one we used to go to by my old house.
2082589	2085210	It's just called The Mongolian Barbecue Behind Wasabi.
2085650	2087751	It's okay, but it's not even the best one.
2090432	2092353	Well, you can't have Mongolian barbecue now.
2092393	2093133	They're all closed.
2096034	2097195	I've never had Korean barbecue.
2103206	2105868	Anyway, so what else are you going to do on your trip?
2107190	2109992	I just got my San Francisco trip cancelled, which is fine.
2110132	2110713	Yeah.
2110913	2111473	What?
2112214	2113735	Dad doesn't want to drive anymore, so.
2114756	2114936	Oh.
2115076	2115817	That's okay.
2116237	2117478	You get to hang with us more.
2118479	2118820	Oh no.
2119180	2121022	You can come over for Vanilla Sky tomorrow night.
2121042	2124925	My spin-off show.
2125646	2126987	I'm so glad you asked, Aaron.
2128649	2134611	Vanilla Sky airs on Orange Lounge Radio every Monday night at 7 o'clock, provided we have a fucking internet connection tomorrow.
2135051	2140293	And on Tuesday nights... God damn it, I'm eating my chips.
2142893	2145574	Tuesday night is Pump Up the Volume with me.
2146795	2148355	Pre-show at 7 o'clock, show at 7.30.
2149336	2149556	To 10.30.
2150896	2152156	No, you can't have any more of my chips.
2153657	2153777	Oh.
2155277	2156278	There's something stuck in here.
2160175	2160295	Oh!
2162535	2163536	No, there's something, anyway.
2165876	2171597	But it's just an hour and a half, I'm sorry, three hours of lots of crap that I decided to play.
2172117	2174878	But if you're in the chat room, you can request something, and if I have it, I'll play it.
2175518	2176898	And if it sucks, I'll laugh at you.
2178478	2179698	And then I talk about killing people.
2182079	2182339	Often.
2184259	2184519	Okay.
2184839	2186920	Will you kill about, will you talk about killing Comcast?
2186940	2188340	Will I kill about fucking?
2190959	2193241	Oh, hi, there's a mic right here.
2193281	2194662	What do I talk about on my show?
2194882	2198925	First of all, Rob, I don't have much of a reason to because my internet was only out for five minutes.
2201427	2202908	And I wasn't even there when it happened.
2203088	2205911	The only thing that obsessed me about that is I was vending at the time.
2206636	2208877	Yeah, so now your vending's gone.
2208917	2212319	And your pre-show got pretty much axed, unfortunately.
2212379	2213859	But now you don't have to do one for next week.
2214600	2215240	I guess not.
2215260	2219562	I was going to say... Oh, my show.
2219642	2221002	Aaron asked what I talk about on my show.
2221082	2227225	I talk about... We talk about news stories sometimes, and then we sometimes get into other games.
2227405	2228986	We talk about Puzzle Pirates a little bit.
2229246	2230266	We talk about Ragnarok.
2230286	2231927	We talk about console games.
2232988	2233268	I saw...
2234471	2236712	So now you even have more reason to join DarkSakura's forums.
2238353	2240494	And just general crap.
2240514	2241955	We have little bits that we do every week.
2242015	2245317	We do video game trivia to bad music.
2246057	2249879	And we do guest the Yahoo talkback because people on Yahoo are idiots.
2251640	2253541	So tune in and see for yourself.
2253981	2255382	Sorry, I just want to answer the question.
2255422	2257143	Anything else you want to say about your show, Jamie, on Tuesdays?
2259921	2267528	I'm going to try to do video game music trivia, like actual where I play music and people guess, for an hour on my show.
2268188	2272292	So let's see if anyone can dethrone Dark Tetsuya.
2273893	2274133	Huh?
2274814	2275815	They can't hear what you're saying.
2279018	2282581	Can he do it?
2282601	2283361	I'll see when I'll start it.
2283381	2284022	You just gotta be there.
2284242	2286784	Alright.
2287385	2287625	That's
2290677	2291197	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft
2323840	2338355	so it's okay if we burn it but Wednesday we'll be playing Max 2 live on air so for those of you that can't get it right now because of money issues or whatever you can play it vicariously through us that's the whole idea and don't worry you'll lose interest just as fast as we will yes
2338815	2339955	and then you won't even want to buy it.
2340195	2343596	But with DDR Max, we actually did this and it was somewhat more successful than we thought.
2343696	2346017	I remember when I got Max, I went live with it.
2346037	2347917	A lot of you really liked tuning in and listening to it.
2347977	2349357	So I'll have the webcam going and everything.
2349797	2351858	So tune in for that this Wednesday.
2351898	2354718	And the next Wednesday, if it works out... What?
2354999	2361740	Well, I was just going to say that the first time we did that with Max, you kind of didn't have it very well set up.
2362160	2363220	Yeah, it was kind of a shitty set up.
2363240	2366301	But you can already tell it's going to be much better this time because we have Loki's toys.
2368175	2380128	Next Wednesday, the T's aren't crossed and the I's aren't dotted, but we're hoping that we're going to be teaming up with another website to bring you some exclusive programming.
2380188	2380889	That's all I can say.
2382699	2385060	Some very interesting debut programming next Wednesday.
2385601	2386361	Just a one-off show.
2386381	2388162	I don't care about, but whatever.
2389062	2390723	Don't sound too excited.
2391824	2393425	It's going to be big, though.
2393445	2395406	A lot of you guys are going to be all woke.
2395466	2396746	Yeah, you friggin' losers.
2397727	2398527	Anyway, Loki.
2401189	2402649	I haven't been there in a long time.
2402669	2403830	Why are you giving this to me?
2404530	2404710	Here.
2405070	2405711	What are you doing?
2405731	2407292	You're a friggin' nut.
2409511	2410491	I was supposed to talk about my show.
2410992	2414493	My show is called Mass Bondage Orgy.
2414573	2416114	It's every Thursday.
2416674	2419695	We have a Mass Bondage Orgy in the middle of the room.
2419875	2422176	We kind of moved the table over because, you know, it's kind of in the way.
2424697	2427318	But that pretty much explains the stains on the ground.
2430694	2434938	Yeah, so Mass Bonded Georgie every Thursday at 7 o'clock.
2435218	2436499	Are you seriously changing the name?
2437860	2439141	I bet more people would tune in.
2440862	2443104	You know, that would be pretty funny.
2443905	2454694	Loki's been having... I feel bad because people tune in to listen to my train wreck of a show, and Jamie gets some pretty good listenership on her show, but for some reason you guys are not tuning in on Thursdays.
2454934	2455895	Hey, guess what, you guys?
2455995	2457056	Friends sucks.
2457216	2459317	Don't watch Friends, listen to Loki's show.
2459538	2465161	Oh, if the same amount of people keep tuning in constantly, I guess I'm going to have to stop doing my show.
2465241	2467483	It'll take a day off, you know.
2470344	2470765	What?
2471665	2472626	Do you need to borrow a TV?
2472646	2473286	We have an extra.
2475808	2476388	We'll see what we can do.
2476468	2477049	We'll see what we can do.
2478950	2480511	I'm willing to sell mine for cheap.
2483922	2488845	I have a nice 19 inch TV, pretty much like new, I just upgraded to a 25.
2488945	2493188	Anyway, Livewire, this is why no one tunes in Loki, talk about Livewire.
2493288	2499372	Livewire, it's my mixing show, it's been going on for like 7 weeks now, except for one week where I didn't do it because it was my birthday.
2499992	2500733	And then, um...
2501696	2513845	Yeah, so we did last week was Bomani remixed music and we played a lot of like erotic trance stuff and then a lot of just remix stuff like from 2DX and DDR and that kind of crap.
2514525	2521591	And then, you know, you guys were, you know, treated to a very nice set, you know, all four of you that tuned in.
2522191	2525854	And actually, you know what, it was a good set of music.
2526034	2526654	It was some good stuff.
2526674	2528256	And you had some stuff in there we never heard before.
2528316	2530277	Like you had the long version of that Drifting Away mix.
2530297	2530857	That was cool.
2531098	2531358	Yeah.
2533237	2536678	Pretty much, um, yeah, my show, I give it like a C+.
2536938	2537658	It's okay.
2538439	2540259	It's like... Yeah, don't sell it.
2540659	2543100	You sure know how to sell your show, Loki, I'll tell ya.
2543520	2545041	It's the best damn thing ever.
2545101	2545661	There you go.
2545781	2546321	There you go.
2546381	2547882	It's the best damn thing ever.
2548462	2548662	Ooh.
2549042	2550983	Women get naked on Loki's show.
2551143	2551643	Oh, hell yes.
2553697	2555758	They're just naked on the other side of the computer.
2556078	2556479	That's it.
2556579	2560281	From now on, for my show, I'm going to put a live nudie picture on the webcam.
2561021	2561762	There you go.
2562002	2562662	There you go.
2562802	2564063	Instead of for people to tune in.
2564143	2565424	Nudity on live wire.
2566084	2567025	It's a sweep stunt.
2568566	2569046	Yeah.
2569907	2570207	I know.
2570727	2573609	He needs to have like a flash version of Gals Panic.
2574549	2575950	That only is up during his show.
2576470	2577131	If you're tuned in.
2577491	2577931	Wow.
2578431	2578832	Uh, no.
2580435	2580875	There you go.
2581176	2583458	Marin says, the best damn remix show ever.
2585240	2590305	I like, it is the best damn live Bomani remixing show on live 365.
2590605	2591966	We know this for a fact.
2593568	2594128	Yeah.
2595470	2596771	Yes, all one of them.
2597992	2598332	Loser.
2600353	2602375	Freakin' A, yeah, so it's my show.
2602755	2606038	I try to have it prepared before, you know, I go live.
2606459	2608300	Sometimes I do, sometimes I don't.
2608640	2613064	Like this week, I just kind of pulled it together five minutes after the show started, so.
2615787	2616968	Yeah, they all are.
2617268	2621292	Now, if I'm not mistaking, don't we have a new Loki remix we're debuting tonight?
2621732	2622253	Yeah.
2622973	2623093	Ah!
2623474	2625536	We'll do that towards the end of the show, because, um...
2627904	2629325	I have banned that guy five times on BBRP.
2652998	2654600	Are you done whoring out Livewire?
2655260	2658624	Yeah, speaking of whores, plenty of whores on Livewire!
2658664	2659605	Lots of whores!
2660286	2661807	And mass bondage.
2662188	2664370	In fact, we're just gonna play, like, pornos.
2664390	2668715	Nah, that's alright.
2669555	2671237	He has his own collection in the closet.
2673039	2673439	Nah.
2674420	2675502	Just have handcuffs.
2676758	2678499	And those are the lame handcuffs, too.
2678839	2679839	Are they fuzzy handcuffs?
2680500	2683121	No, they're plastic handcuffs I got with the Lupin kit.
2688203	2688843	No one missed it.
2689723	2690083	I got it.
2690143	2690604	It was great.
2691364	2693665	Anyway, we kind of cut Shane off.
2695185	2700127	I feel bad because Aaron gave us a chance to openly whore out our shows, and we just jumped all over it.
2700167	2702728	We're like, screw the guy who came out here 1,700 miles.
2706167	2708888	I think that we just hopped on that one and dry humped that segment.
2710428	2712289	Plenty of dry humping on Livewire.
2715570	2718971	We apologize for dry humping your monologue, you may now continue.
2720572	2724733	Okay, dry humping the monologue, sex with my dad, sex with my uncle, God.
2736670	2743172	Anyway, I didn't really have anything else to say except for it's awesome here and I miss it a lot.
2743792	2747194	Anybody else have anything to say, Rob?
2748974	2750655	Is somebody trying to ban Nostald?
2751455	2752855	No, I'm copying his quote.
2753316	2754076	Don't ban him.
2754576	2756637	I'm not banning him, you retard.
2756657	2757337	Was somebody just...
2762426	2764467	I already ended it again.
2764487	2768510	Well, shit, maybe we ought to just go to a break then.
2768530	2768670	Eh, no.
2768710	2771972	Why don't I just hand the mic to Jamie?
2788806	2795948	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2815738	2819882	Oh wait, I lost the link for our forums.
2820102	2821704	Where are our forums, Rob?
2822845	2827249	www.kaleebomani.com Click on forums.
2838661	2839381	No, not on me.
2839661	2847144	Okay, let's... So everybody, send Rob, flood Rob with private messages with everything that pisses you off.
2847364	2848284	Alright, sounds good to me.
2849584	2850705	And then ping him.
2850745	2852945	God, our connection sucks enough thanks to Comcast.
2855406	2858147	And then everyone, ping Nostylan.
2859527	2859988	At once.
2860128	2861168	Don't ping Nostylan.
2868093	2869154	Hump the boxes!
2877620	2881202	By the way, for the record, Diet Vanilla Pepsi tastes like shit.
2884324	2890449	Because aspartame is bad for you, and it turns to a chemical that's like formaldehyde when heated to body temperature.
2890469	2891750	Really?
2891770	2892090	Really?
2895580	2897061	That's why Propel is better for you.
2901263	2904665	The V8 is made with... V8 Red Splash.
2905025	2905305	It's good.
2905325	2905905	With Splenda.
2906145	2907366	Actually, it's the regular.
2907746	2908687	It's not Diet Splash.
2911108	2912649	There's real V8 Splash in the fridge.
2915530	2918252	He'll go beat up a pineapple so you can have the juice of the pineapple.
2919358	2920579	This is really good radio.
2920719	2922861	Anyway, so Rob, where's my music?
2923301	2926743	Sorry, we're still having some buffering issues.
2926863	2927544	Son of a bitch.
2929125	2931547	I'm going to buffer Comcast in about two seconds.
2932607	2934108	Well, we'll just start off without it.
2934169	2935049	This is fucked up.
2935109	2935529	Here we go.
2936110	2936610	Hold on, hold on.
2936630	2937731	I'm getting your song.
2940213	2941233	Wait, I'm racing you now.
2943855	2945176	Shit, I went into the wrong directory.
2945216	2945837	I'm fucked now.
2949888	2951429	This is really, really good radio.
2951489	2952190	I'm very impressed.
2952210	2953190	That's a bit further into it.
2953230	2954051	Okay, there we go.
2954091	2954491	Here it is.
2974005	2988855	Okay, the first one of the week goes toward one of the moderators on a forum that I roleplay on, and I'm not going to say the forum yet, because I actually have no problem with everybody else but this moderator, who's abusing his power.
2989395	2992417	First of all, okay, this is funny, he accuses me of flaming.
2993358	2996640	Accuses me of, you know, all this stuff.
2996960	2999582	The first thing is, how many boards do I moderate on now?
3000022	3001884	Five, six, seven boards?
3002544	3003445	An admin three?
3004625	3011110	Okay, this has struck me, so I've reported him to the side admin, so that we can be careful, please.
3011810	3016413	Unless, you know, he's dry-humping the admins.
3016513	3020135	Um, hold on.
3021836	3025599	He'd probably have to be doing more than dry-humping the admins to get away with that.
3027130	3031654	You know, I would give the admin of this site more credit than to have such foretaste.
3031794	3032655	We'll go ahead.
3033235	3047708	But, you know, if it turns out that there's no resolution to this soon, then I'm going to do some very public announcements and possibly report the site to their sponsor.
3049269	3049329	Ooh.
3051789	3052590	because you know what?
3053631	3055752	There's a few things that I tolerate.
3056713	3057454	Everyone knows me.
3057514	3061757	If I have a problem with the service, even if it's free, oh, I will let them know.
3062017	3062838	I will let them know.
3062958	3072746	So, yes, I'm a good moderator who hardly checks the board anymore.
3073166	3075208	But no, that was really my only thing.
3075909	3078831	One goes, you know, I was really, I guess, lonely.
3080595	3081756	Nobody came to my house!
3083217	3083797	Damn you, people.
3084998	3095625	So I was... So I was there, um... And then... And then, uh... Really nothing else happened.
3095925	3097206	Alright.
3098287	3099207	It's evil sounding.
3100848	3101589	Fine!
3101849	3104191	I just deleted it off the damn playlist, too.
3105551	3109254	You guys are never satisfied.
3111943	3113183	Just keep this.
3117465	3120026	Aaron says they won't be satisfied until you start doing sexual favors.
3120226	3121166	Okay, who wants dibs?
3121527	3123167	I'm joking.
3123227	3124868	Fine, here you go.
3124888	3125788	Hope you're happy.
3129289	3134011	Anyways, F you to Comcast, because, I don't know, everyone was mad at them, so.
3134852	3139233	But I got to eat my ultimate cheeseburger today, because of that.
3139953	3141054	Jack in the Box should be paying you.
3141656	3141936	Yes.
3142877	3148321	Anyways, F you to the fact that my stuff costs so much for this damn cabinet.
3148442	3149663	You know, why can't it be free?
3150363	3150964	It's just wood.
3151184	3152605	I mean, trees are dead anyways.
3153626	3155167	F you to that.
3155287	3159290	F you to the fact that Lowe's doesn't have the size brackets I need for my...
3160894	3168759	Uh, Keyboard Tray, so I couldn't get them after wandering hours through that store looking for keyboard tray bracket thingies.
3169500	3170680	Yeah, that sucks.
3170921	3172742	But, um, uh, what else?
3173102	3183889	Oh, um, F you for a cable going out because I was downloading, um, Evil Dead 1-2, Army of Darkness, and Into the Woods, and that stopped about 77%.
3185510	3189653	Um, F you to people at my work because they just suck.
3190885	3191746	You really annoy me.
3192587	3201475	You know, if I'm on the bottom floor of my company and I'm next to the elevator, if you ask me if I'm going up, I'm gonna hit you.
3202435	3203256	I have no choice.
3203396	3204337	I can't go down.
3204818	3205698	I have to go up.
3206659	3208101	Maybe they want you to go down.
3210303	3212244	In that bondage orgy of yours.
3213085	3213966	Not with that old bitch.
3215199	3218201	There's this one bitch that walks around at work, I swear to god she's like a zombie.
3218421	3219702	She should be dead already.
3220143	3222885	She just looks so decrepit and old and smoking.
3222905	3224706	I'm just like counting the seconds.
3227048	3227928	Effie to NASA.
3228989	3236115	You know, crashing something that costs 1.5 billion dollars is pretty stupid just because you didn't want to contaminate a moon on Jupiter.
3237085	3240149	with bacteria that might be on the satellite probe.
3240689	3243532	Who gives a flying fuck what happens to the moons of Jupiter?
3243793	3246876	They can fly away and smash into Neptune for all I care.
3247477	3248939	It doesn't really matter.
3249279	3252803	And if, oh, we kill life on Jupiter's moon, are we really gonna know?
3253644	3254105	Seriously.
3255296	3257558	and waste $1.5 billion for that.
3257638	3258539	You know what I think it is?
3258939	3269988	I think that that satellite didn't cost $1.5 billion, that they pocketed the difference and, you know, financed, God knows what, a penis enlargement for George Bush.
3270548	3270949	I don't know.
3272230	3272630	It doesn't...
3275148	3284888	They financed that deal when they were trying to unify and automate all of the McDonalds to where it registered everything that every store did, but of course that failed and the company lost a lot of money.
3289103	3294627	FQ to the RAA and the MPAA because you think that you know how to stop people from file sharing.
3295028	3302633	You know, it's kind of funny because I do remember Napster, you know, and how nothing changed and it's only gotten worse.
3302953	3304654	So what do you think is going to happen this time?
3304674	3309898	You think it's going to magically solve itself and, oh, people are going to stop because they're getting sued.
3310258	3317844	No, when you look at the statistics and you have 261 people out of millions of people downloading stuff, that's a pretty small statistic.
3318504	3322328	Hell, getting struck by lightning, you have more chance than, you know.
3324471	3328015	Um, FE to Hurricanes, because, um, they're windy.
3329136	3329917	And, um, also, um...
3336838	3339440	FU the fact that I bought these spinners and I can't use them for anything.
3340501	3342042	That sucks, and I cry.
3343523	3344824	Those spinners are so nice.
3346065	3356833	And FU the people who don't like me talking, because I don't care what you think, and I'm going to keep talking over and over and over again, and I'm going to keep rambling on and on and make this segment go longer than it really needs to.
3360476	3362057	Will you talk during the mass bondage orgy?
3362197	3362558	Oh, yes.
3362698	3365200	I'm doing play-by-play for that mass bondage orgy.
3367262	3372168	And um, F you for not being super duper rich so I can have an outing at a strip club.
3377354	3378616	Because it would be cool.
3379917	3380818	Because I could.
3384983	3385664	Yeah, maybe.
3387732	3393376	Anyways, um... I might be done.
3393956	3394176	Wait.
3394857	3395117	Wait.
3395877	3396138	Wait.
3396738	3397258	Wait for it.
3398159	3398839	Oh, oh, oh.
3399200	3399640	I remember now.
3400300	3409226	F you to the stupid discount toy store in the outlet mall, because I was gonna buy about another six ferrets, but none of them freaking squeaked.
3410367	3412028	That would've been hilarious.
3412068	3412588	Darn.
3412828	3413129	Darn.
3413149	3413829	Big darn.
3414189	3414710	Don't worry.
3416271	3416831	But anyways...
3418171	3418591	Soundbite.
3419211	3419872	Soundbite music.
3420212	3427994	My turn.
3428935	3439698	My FUs for this week start off with the one and only Comcast, I hate you, you burn in hell, I hope you catch SARS, and I hope your dick falls off.
3440979	3441679	You suck.
3442631	3449277	We have like, our listeners are going through hell tonight trying to listen to this show because you guys are assifying our connection.
3449297	3450297	I just made a new verb.
3452339	3456863	Assifying our connection and you suck and yeah.
3460666	3463669	Well Comcast may be a guy but it drives like a woman.
3466803	3468443	Just kidding, just kidding, just kidding.
3469064	3470504	Just kidding, god.
3472204	3474305	That joke was too easy, come on.
3474845	3478586	That joke... That was, I love Eren.
3481607	3483647	That joke was way too easy, come on.
3489429	3489849	Anyway...
3495877	3497538	It's a feng shui of the highway.
3497618	3500020	Aaron's ranting about old drivers, of course.
3500100	3501120	Well, here, here's the mic.
3501801	3510346	That's pretty much all I have to... You know what, I'm sure there's plenty of other things I could be mad at right now, but Comcast takes the fucking cake.
3511147	3513868	F you, there's a microphone in court because I swear to God it's trying to kill me.
3516550	3518991	Yeah, you have to listen to the... Wait, no, that was last week.
3519152	3519472	Yeah, man.
3521473	3524115	Alright, moving on, let's hear from our other...
3525129	3525909	Yes, let's start.
3525969	3527850	I guess since Erin has a mic, we'll let her go.
3528270	3529890	Erin, what do you want to say FU to this week?
3530291	3532871	First of all, another big FU to Comcast.
3533692	3536012	I hope that you guys all rot in hell.
3536492	3537953	And I will go after you all!
3538453	3540073	I swear to God, you're worse than AOL.
3540274	3541434	You all know how AOL is.
3542560	3545201	Another big F you goes to the governor's race right now.
3545721	3551684	I don't trust Bustamante, Governor Gray Davis is an idiot, and Schwarzenegger doesn't know jack shit about politics.
3552645	3556306	And unfortunately that looks like the future of our state.
3557387	3558908	Yeah, vote for the porn star, people!
3561089	3561729	Oh, you're running.
3565170	3565631	Jokes!
3566584	3566944	Jokes.
3567144	3567664	No, we're fine.
3567684	3568265	Just keep going.
3569365	3578288	The problem is there's a problem somewhere between Comcast and Live365 right now, so when we're trying to upload the show to Live365, we're dropping out massively.
3578428	3580689	I mean, but we're still recording as a whole show.
3582070	3584631	He said drop out, and we're playing drop out.
3588570	3591132	I hope you catch Saws.
3592332	3596535	So, yeah, we're just going to keep going because Wednesday and Thursday's Rewind, this won't be here.
3596555	3599176	It's going to still be one big show, so keep going.
3599717	3613445	Okay, I guess another big FU goes to, I would say an unnamed group of people at an arcade who start drama over Initial D. Now!
3614537	3618719	I've been around DDF Freak long enough to know, okay, it's huge, I know there's drama.
3619619	3622500	And when there was drama in the parent community, I just said, fuck it, I'm leaving.
3622520	3626402	Okay, but when you start drama in the initial D community, what kind of idiots are you?
3628623	3633645	Okay, just because some guy is going out with some girl doesn't mean you're going to start spreading rumors about him.
3634265	3636446	It's not a high school anymore, get over it!
3639828	3647710	This goes to the people who post on the initial D thread on the board that I mod.
3648130	3649731	You guys start drama again.
3650131	3651431	I will go after all of you.
3651451	3652891	That initial D has its own thread.
3653431	3656932	That's sad.
3656952	3657572	He'll tell you.
3657672	3659993	I'm starting the pole position thread on DDR Freak.
3660233	3661173	Okay.
3661393	3662093	You're a loser.
3662694	3664694	No one plays pole position anymore.
3664754	3666855	I play pole position anymore.
3666935	3667475	Screw you.
3667755	3668235	Sorry, Aaron.
3669382	3672866	That is my ultimatum to all who post on the initial D thread.
3672986	3676569	I am counting warnings right now, so don't piss me off.
3676890	3679652	And I am nearing that time of the month, so don't piss me off.
3679672	3689021	Because if you do, I will go find... I know people who have large, large swords, and I know where you all live.
3689041	3691424	And what do you mean by swords?
3692952	3696014	Is that a sexual innuendo there?
3696034	3696654	Loki, no!
3696815	3704039	I mean weapons, actual weapons, metal... Sharp metal swords that will slice them all up.
3704059	3709903	Okay, I have how... It's nice that the boards are quiet right now, but... Yeah.
3710924	3712485	And... Huh?
3713706	3718369	Coming from a fellow moderator of those boards, it's kind of boring now when there's like three new posts a day.
3719338	3723860	Well, it's actually kind of nice because the people posting are all the intelligent people.
3724280	3724620	True.
3725400	3731882	If you notice, we've had no AZN people, we've had no Flame Wars, we've had no drama.
3732303	3732843	Poor Baka.
3733903	3734063	Oh!
3735004	3737064	Okay, see, now you just gave it away, alright?
3738045	3738445	Well.
3739925	3740205	Well.
3740726	3744547	Actually, now that you've blown our coverage, there's no Oliver either, thank God.
3749127	3762878	So, I guess I'm done with my FUs, other than the fact that a big FU goes to my apartment for the leaky toilet, the noisy fan, the lack of vents, which will suffocate me one day and I'm going to kill my landlady, and the wobbly furniture.
3764600	3767562	So, yeah.
3767582	3768323	I'll hand it over to Andrew.
3768343	3770745	Oh, okay, you can go Josh, that's fine.
3771485	3771805	Joey.
3773607	3773987	Josh?
3774167	3774828	Who's Josh?
3775088	3775388	Sorry.
3777153	3778994	Nobody.
3779814	3780154	Right.
3781714	3782055	Okay.
3783135	3784275	My FUs for the week.
3785156	3788877	I would have to say I'm going to kill the already dead horse.
3789677	3792758	FU to Comcast, I've been down for five days.
3792798	3794859	You can't say FU to Comcast enough.
3794899	3795499	Say it again.
3796119	3799120	I've been down for five days.
3799140	3802501	I am having internet withdrawals.
3802721	3803902	I am tired.
3810433	3811974	Jokes, people, jokes.
3812335	3814417	So, yes, that's one of them.
3815938	3820242	Go to hell with your $57 a month and I've been down for five days.
3820322	3834235	Anyway, my other FU would be to all the people in Nevada and Northern California that lock their keys in the car and leave their lights on because it makes my life a living hell.
3835316	3836237	So, that'll be it.
3838879	3840241	Um, let's hear from Shane.
3841802	3844865	Um, first off, F you to Elko, Nevada.
3845585	3848528	I wanted Taco Bell at night because I hadn't eaten anything all day.
3849509	3853893	And is it so hard to keep your stupid store open till, like, 10.01?
3853933	3855975	Frickin' closing at 10.
3856996	3859258	Um, F you to old people because...
3863886	3870651	I was at Taco Bell and this old guy slammed his door into my parked car and tried to blame it on me, because he's old.
3871951	3878476	And F you to my living situation because I sleep out in the living room because they can't seem to find room for me in their rooms.
3878736	3880037	So, yeah.
3880497	3883699	And F you to driving to California instead of flying because it's really boring.
3885189	3886650	Wait, do you pay rent at that place?
3887010	3889291	Yeah, I pay like $1.80 a month.
3889351	3890911	Oh my god.
3890931	3893032	I sleep on the couch.
3893092	3895573	You know how much we pay here?
3896233	3899995	At least three times a... Well, I mean, well, actually, well, each... Well, it doesn't matter.
3900035	3900315	Anyway.
3900975	3901936	Point I was trying to make.
3902116	3903977	If you pay rent there, you should have your own room.
3904277	3909099	Yeah, well, this one guy has all his music stuff in there, so... Well, fuck his stuff.
3909119	3909879	You're more important...
3911104	3912744	We're trying to kick him out by raising his rent.
3912844	3919505	I was going to say, sorry if you're listening, dude, but that's not cool to make somebody sleep on the couch unless they're not paying rent, if you're being nice.
3919605	3922986	And my computer's in the corner, so I can't, like, get any privacy.
3924666	3925426	Oh my god.
3927267	3930327	You're robbing this man of his internet pornography.
3930347	3931268	That's horrible.
3931308	3931808	Jeez.
3935148	3938029	Anyway, um, yeah, that's all my FDs, so.
3938529	3938889	Thank you.
3939269	3939509	Andrew.
3944776	3951242	First of all, Victor, F you to you, you're not funny, I want my name back, I want my jokes back, bitch.
3952022	3952803	All five of them.
3956346	3961291	Second of all, F you to people who get my attention by picking up the phone when I'm online.
3962011	3965735	Stop it, I'm playing Ragnarok, I'm trying to vend.
3967196	3969117	Dark, take the phone to the hand, that would be beautiful.
3969777	3972439	Either that or I rig up a timer or turn off the TV every time I pick up the phone.
3972479	3977141	Or just the phone, the phone that she uses, just pull the cord out from the back so she picks it up and doesn't do anything.
3977401	3977742	Oh, sure.
3978362	3980143	She just goes into the other room and picks up her phone.
3980843	3981884	Unplug that one, too!
3981904	3992129	We got door locks, so... Anyway, uh, FU to Sakura, that song is a bitch.
3993530	3995331	Passed it, like, what, fifth try.
3997105	3997385	No!
3997905	3999366	Get that whip away from me, Jamie!
4000807	4004409	In case you guys are wondering, that's the two ferrets tied up with my whip.
4004889	4005449	On the webcam.
4005769	4006670	Yes, on the webcam.
4006930	4007570	So, go ahead, Andy.
4010612	4011672	Okay, okay, okay.
4011732	4013773	How about a mutual FU to Legend of Max, okay?
4014374	4015134	Just to make it balanced.
4015654	4016935	Holy shit, he's gonna hit me.
4021677	4026600	And once again, FU to Angel not being able to tune in today.
4027330	4028791	It's for what?
4028811	4029572	A month and a half.
4030012	4030433	Oh, shit!
4032655	4033996	Parrots flying everywhere!
4034016	4039100	Is that Orlando?
4039340	4040341	Uh, yeah, that's it.
4042163	4043243	Oh, you didn't do it, puppy?
4043384	4043744	I'm sorry.
4044224	4047067	I need to rant a little.
4048548	4049329	Jeez, watch out here.
4052011	4052671	Fling that parrot.
4053772	4054413	Okay, um...
4056283	4058184	Like, uh, yeah, what should I say?
4060646	4072574	Fuck you to, uh, fuck bad, uh, bike tires because my tires for my bike is sitting flat in my room because it was broken and I need to get respect for it.
4074075	4077838	And meanwhile, there's spirit baseball going on in the living room.
4084151	4086232	I can give play-by-play of Ferret Baseball.
4089173	4090153	Facing up the middle!
4091334	4092054	Andrew Fields it!
4092214	4092874	The throw home!
4097496	4097956	The pitch!
4100097	4102538	It's a bluebird down the left field line!
4107867	4115948	I'm getting kind of distracted by the fact that Loki is batting a ferret around the room.
4117569	4120949	Damn it, I forgot my FUs!
4120969	4125170	Come on, you can remember!
4125190	4126890	Don't beat me, Jamie, no!
4131429	4133810	I think there's no more insanity here!
4136430	4137391	I'm gonna back up now.
4138351	4140952	I'm going to back up this way out of Jamie's range.
4141872	4143592	Ah, barely just out of the range, okay.
4144053	4156176	Now, uh, fuck this guy for depriving me of sleep all this week, and, uh, fuck the Tapioca Express and Davis for letting your GDR machine go to shit.
4158131	4158731	Exactly!
4160893	4161954	I couldn't agree more!
4161974	4165737	Yeah, I know, it's just a bitch, isn't it?
4165917	4171661	Yeah, totally.
4174103	4175304	Hey, listen, there's you, the ferret.
4175664	4179768	Dear ferret, what do you think of Orange Lounge Radio?
4182770	4183510	Okay, um... And...
4188203	4189604	Fuck that arcade, it's in the end.
4191505	4194186	Now I can finally change the music because it's time for the chatroom FUs.
4195006	4195947	Give them something happy.
4197548	4198768	Give them the Ohaska.
4203070	4205591	Dartetsuya would like to say F you to Comcast.
4205631	4206172	Enough said.
4206212	4206552	Thank you.
4209176	4212297	I have something to say in addition to your Initial D Battle Horse comment.
4212337	4212458	Yeah.
4236431	4262027	because they start too much drama because I don't know why I don't know why you guys yeah that's all it is just drama whatever happened to the times there was like no drama when everyone is happy why do you think I play at home but yeah you don't need to start drama over every single person's life please stop if you bring it to the board I will be very very angry
4264827	4267189	Fuck this Live365 operator guy.
4267850	4275116	Because when they can't connect to the stream, when we go out, Live365 operator guy comes on and says, You're listening to a station that is currently unavailable.
4275416	4279740	Please try... It would be better, though, if they had, like, some lounge music playing.
4279820	4281461	Yeah, some Tom Jones.
4283743	4285365	Moving on with EvilMaliki2DX's FUs.
4285685	4291010	Oh, and fuck the lazy-ass volunteers who didn't do shit in the video game room at JTAF and just wanted to get into the con for free.
4291932	4296436	and fuck the hotel maids at Best Western Miyako Inn for giving me a hard time.
4297136	4297877	A hard time.
4299538	4302261	Oh, and fuck Uni's dad for being such a cheap ass.
4305478	4310563	NoStylin says, my FU of the week is screw little rocks you find in charcoal.
4311024	4314167	I mean, God, you buy the good brands and you still get little pebbles in there.
4314227	4315068	I go, what the fuck?
4315348	4319512	I mean, you pay $1.99 for a stick of good old charcoal and you get this little pebble.
4319792	4321974	It just messes up a good drawing.
4322055	4322455	Grr.
4328121	4329342	Oh, I thought it was barbecue charcoal.
4330666	4332607	You can do really good drawings of BBQ charcoal though.
4333007	4338188	John Fields would like to say, F you to my inability to learn new languages quickly.
4338448	4342529	F you to Honda for forgetting to order the part for my car and thus wasting my Saturday.
4343369	4345950	F you to RCN for not fixing my cable again.
4346010	4347431	Hey, at least they're not as bad as Comcast.
4349851	4354532	F you to my GameCube making weird clicking sounds and causing PSO to crash all the time.
4355153	4355833	That's not good.
4355893	4356233	What would you...
4358779	4361181	What does it mean if a GameCube is making clicking noises?
4361261	4361862	That can't be good.
4361882	4365585	Victor, you are actually a winner for saying that AOL equals Governor Davis.
4366626	4367046	Thank you.
4368907	4370309	Be nice to Governor Davis.
4371630	4372590	Don't insult AOL like that.
4376373	4380277	Alright, that was John Fields who has a clicking GameCube.
4382558	4383059	Chaos!
4385069	4390036	says F you to government class because it is the stupidest class in the world.
4390517	4392720	So fucking stupid.
4393081	4393381	The end.
4394883	4395144	He did.
4395184	4397227	He put so fucking stupid.
4400932	4401313	Minced.
4402742	4405024	would like to say F you to my digital systems class.
4405164	4407886	I hate inverse logic and De Morgan's theorem.
4408687	4409447	Otherwise, I'm good.
4409788	4414652	Except for the fact that once the buffering is coming from the other side for once.
4414772	4415392	Yeah, thanks.
4417534	4418315	Thanks a lot.
4423279	4423899	Oh, boy.
4424520	4424960	Hey, Rob.
4425240	4425560	Rob.
4425861	4426101	Rob.
4426521	4426721	Rob.
4426841	4427122	What?
4427482	4427742	Hi.
4427982	4428183	Hi.
4428203	4428243	Hi.
4430353	4434294	I'm gonna shove that ferret up your ass and push the button.
4436394	4444876	Jason, our buddy down in the southwest, says an FU to myself for missing like three Orange Lounge radios.
4445496	4446177	Unacceptable.
4446277	4446757	Fired!
4449017	4451938	An FU to Live365 for being Microsoft's whores.
4454907	4459049	By the way, Loki, congratulations about your plan.
4459949	4465591	Jason would also like to say a F you to stupid computer crap happening to keep me from listening.
4466892	4467812	You can blame Comcast.
4467832	4469333	Send those cards and letters to Comcast.
4469853	4470713	Care of Satan.
4471774	4476035	StaplerX would like to say F you to the assholes at JTAF also.
4476376	4479697	They took 10 years off our video program Head's Life.
4482779	4484921	You should let me run a movie room at one of those cons.
4486042	4486983	I never found out though.
4487003	4487243	That's it.
4487263	4489104	I have read all the FUs that I have been given.
4489124	4489485	So if you...
4504016	4505117	Oh, did one just pop up?
4506077	4507117	Oh, she's still telling the story.
4507137	4508618	I'm sorry, did your alcoholist still tell the story here?
4508998	4513020	I got home and found the driver's side front tire starting to shed its tread.
4514881	4515181	Ouch.
4515541	4516442	I took it to Sears.
4517922	4519203	The story's coming in a little bit too.
4519223	4522385	While the story's going on, I'm going to say I have read all the FUs at this point.
4522705	4525126	If you didn't hear yours due to a buffering issue, sorry.
4525945	4528227	We're just trying to go through the show as we usually do.
4528707	4534872	The show will play in its entirety without these buffering problems, hopefully, provided Live365 isn't using Comcast.
4535592	4542418	The show will play through in its entirety on Wednesday and Thursday, and we might, actually, we might play it tomorrow night after Vanilla Sky as well.
4544539	4548402	Diddy Alcoholic says, took it to Sears, all four of the tires need to get fixed.
4548702	4549323	All four!
4551625	4551885	Sucks.
4558143	4561064	She says actually only three were bad, but she might as well change all four.
4564685	4568186	Um, tonight, what do you guys think?
4568366	4571107	I don't know if we should do a cage match tonight because of our issues.
4571307	4572287	Yes, we're doing a cage match.
4572307	4574387	Well, what about because of our issues, the guys aren't going to be able to vote?
4575108	4577328	They're not able to stay on the stream long enough to hear a song.
4578028	4579389	I went through a lot of trouble.
4580089	4581169	Poopy on Comcast!
4581189	4581909	I went through a lot of trouble.
4581929	4582890	Should we table it to next week?
4585470	4586451	Okay.
4586911	4587631	Yeah, I think we're going to...
4588905	4591606	We could, okay, we could do it this way.
4592086	4593646	We could instead of letting, well, I don't know.
4593726	4596727	I could say instead of letting the chat room vote, we could let everybody else here vote.
4596867	4598808	But that might be kind of tough and biased.
4598848	4600568	There's enough people here to vote.
4602389	4603029	I don't know.
4603049	4604929	What do you guys think?
4605169	4607610	Hey, are we going to do a cage match and have you guys vote?
4610612	4612053	We can try to let the listeners do it.
4612073	4612773	Let's see what happens.
4613434	4615395	Let us know what you want to do.
4615415	4616476	Do you want us to try Cage Match?
4616596	4622500	If I don't get at least five votes in the chat room, then we're tabling it over to the room here.
4622800	4624461	So that's what we're going to do.
4626763	4630505	It's not a big deal, but... Oh, sorry, she didn't write earlier.
4630866	4631306	That's okay.
4631446	4631746	It happens.
4632367	4632587	Okay.
4634585	4638688	They're saying the stream's okay right now, so we're going to do the cage match right now.
4638748	4639068	Why not?
4639088	4639809	Let's just get into it.
4641550	4643632	We're doing a commercial-free show tonight, apparently.
4644512	4645013	That's alright.
4645813	4647134	It might be too commercial anyway.
4651438	4653299	I was funny, and no one noticed.
4657813	4662675	Last week in the Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match, the MP3 that I was sent from D.R.
4662735	4666917	Angel won, and it was a mislabeled MP3, actually.
4666977	4673440	I found out a little, just after the show, I found out the MP3 was actually mislabeled, so you voted for the wrong thing, actually.
4673961	4677742	I said on the show that it was a band called Froggy that won.
4678343	4680324	It's actually Foggy, no R.
4681024	4683245	So the band that actually won last night was Foggy.
4684006	4684706	I'm sorry, last week.
4684906	4689248	Last week was Foggy, and the song is called Come Into My Dream.
4689329	4691910	So this is the song that won last week.
4692050	4692250	Huh?
4693671	4694091	You what?
4695012	4695992	Oh, you downloaded a DJ?
4696252	4696693	Oh, good.
4698934	4701115	All right, so here it is.
4703076	4706098	This is the first song you can vote for tonight.
4707238	4708259	Why are you guys laughing?
4709079	4709579	Chat room.
4709600	4710340	Chat room.
4710700	4714464	Chatroom says, just died as he said do it.
4714664	4719208	They say the stream's okay right now, so we're gonna do... And apparently we dropped right there.
4721450	4725674	I think it's still gonna work enough for the, uh, for the Cavemen show.
4725734	4726295	Let's do it.
4727596	4734643	Um... I'm gonna continue... No, we're recording this.
4734663	4735884	Let's just get it over with.
4738746	4739166	You know what?
4739506	4744028	My monitor stream's still going, so I think they'll be able to get in.
4745928	4748169	So, cage match!
4752510	4758232	Since we're having a moment of dead airspace, let's offer a moment of silence for our stream.
4761758	4763300	Alright, let's get into it here.
4763441	4768809	Okay, our monitor stream is still going, so I'm assuming that other people need to be connected still.
4768869	4769831	So we're just going to get into it.
4770492	4774578	Last week's winner, first song you can vote for tonight, Foggy, Come Into My Dream.
4774638	4774958	Enjoy.
4840514	4844437	Thank you for watching.
4844457	4845517	See you next time.
4870117	4883377	There were rainbows in the night You and me could fly And the ocean shined so bright And the ocean shined so bright
4928635	4932861	That was a clip of song number one last week's winner, Foggy, with Come Into My Dream.
4932982	4937969	Once again, since we're still having some bad connectivity problems, if...
4938949	4964354	um... we don't get enough people in the chat room and please don't vote chat room you're on your honor tonight please don't vote unless you heard enough of the song where you think you can make an honest vote of all the three songs so if we don't get enough votes from the chat room we're going to vote in house so because of that i'm going to only ask for scores and feedback from the hosts on the next two songs usually we
4965490	4972674	Usually we let the whole room comment on them, but, um, we're, usually, it's mine, go ahead.
4973434	4978216	Usually we let the whole chatroom, or we let the whole room here comment and judge the songs on a scale of 1 to 10.
4978436	4980457	We're not going to do that tonight because you guys may be voting.
4981058	4982378	So, that's that.
4984039	4987301	Okay, uh, Jamie, why don't you introduce your song that you picked tonight?
4988001	4992283	It's, um, I was looking for Jan Johnston songs, well, ones with her singing.
4993368	4996891	and I found one by Freefall with her called Skydive.
4998272	4999333	And I had it on repeat for a while.
5001375	5005739	And then I think that I just had it on my playlist so I put it in there because I didn't really put any thought into it.
5008442	5010263	Alright, so you ready to hear it?
5011264	5013586	Yeah!
5013666	5016489	It's Freefall featuring Jan Johnston with Skydive.
5081074	5094365	The first moment before our first touch We know how long we have to hold each other And we've drowned in love, no such thing we need Now we're here, we have our own language
5120425	5129436	I could skydive on the moon, sail the ocean, on my bed I could swim around, scream my name, take a nap, I'm afraid to run, run, run, to you.
5145271	5147113	Thank you for watching
5190473	5192502	Thank you for watching!
5301503	5304825	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft,
5347918	5349319	Okay, that was song number two tonight.
5349359	5351701	Free Fall featuring Jan Johnston with Skydive.
5351721	5353743	Let's go around and see what the hosts thought of that one.
5354223	5354584	Jamie.
5355064	5355304	Nine.
5356205	5356646	No comments?
5357286	5359128	No, nine as in the number, not German.
5361169	5361490	Loki.
5362951	5365953	It was okay, but I like some of the other ones that she does better.
5366674	5368336	So I give it like an eight.
5369938	5370338	I agree.
5371078	5372319	Jan Johnson, great.
5372499	5375180	Love that other one that Jamie brought about two months ago.
5375300	5377521	That one, eh, okay.
5377881	5381462	I think I'd be interested to hear more Janis Johnson stuff, but not necessarily that song.
5381942	5383223	I give it a seven.
5383683	5389485	Why don't I replace her, you know, replace Paula Terry with Jan Johnson?
5389505	5390706	Dude, that would be awesome.
5390746	5391686	Good idea.
5391766	5392546	Dear Konami.
5394107	5394387	All right.
5395910	5396571	So there you go.
5396651	5399812	We would usually at this point go around and see what our other guests think.
5399832	5400753	But we don't care what they think.
5400773	5401633	But we don't care what they think.
5401693	5401813	No.
5402253	5402434	No.
5402634	5403574	What did you pick today?
5404895	5407396	I picked this one because, you know, whatever.
5407616	5408577	I made it today.
5408917	5410278	It's cool, I guess.
5410458	5414780	It's the Fly, the 2003 Burst mix.
5415060	5417401	It's just a Burst style, I should say.
5418141	5423204	Blatantly ripping off of the, what was it, B-Rocku, you know, 1998 Burst style, so...
5425805	5433607	It's The Fly, 2003, Burst Style, Loki vs. The Deep Project, and I'm sure you'll recognize some of the samples in there.
5433868	5444651	Actually, this was the song that they sampled another song that was in DDR Extreme and also was sampled in one of my remixes, so you'll probably recognize some of them.
5446525	5449209	So in other words, it's another Loki remix, a new one.
5450871	5455318	Yeah, it's about as remix as the Politary Orbit Tribe thing was.
5456239	5457461	Alright, well let's have a listen anyway.
5457501	5461286	It's Loki vs. Deep Project with The Fly, 2003 mix.
5461306	5462428	Here it is, song number three.
5636725	5640687	All right, that was song number three, Loki vs. Deep Project with the Fly 2003 Burst Style.
5640707	5640987	Jamie?
5641527	5642248	It was cool, Abe.
5642668	5644329	We're looking at the fake porn.
5644829	5645229	Loki.
5646790	5647930	Eh, it was okay.
5648010	5658275	You know, we were listening in the studio here, and you can't really hear most of it gets drowned out just because the bass is too loud or something.
5658775	5659656	Whatever, I don't care.
5659736	5662157	I threw it together in like an hour.
5663351	5664972	I care not, so whatever.
5666133	5666454	Seven.
5666474	5677202	I feel a little uneducated to make a vote because I'm not familiar enough with the original song, so I'm not sure how much it was actually remixed, but it sounded very much like a video game racing song.
5677262	5678023	It was very good.
5678063	5678523	I liked it.
5679885	5684028	I didn't... I thought you said you mixed it with Electro-Tune, but I don't hear it.
5684388	5686670	I don't know if it's... Is it really sped up or something?
5688331	5690013	Not really, but it has Electro-Tune in it.
5691223	5692084	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5710998	5715481	I feel like I'm being forced to make remixes, so they're turning like crap.
5715841	5718442	God damn it, why'd I have to make The Legend of Trance to begin with?
5718503	5721304	Because now I have to live up to that, and that sucks.
5721584	5723846	You still need to make the one that I asked for.
5724846	5726147	Was that the Safari Trance one?
5726367	5729249	No, the Safari Trance one just won't work because no one's that talented.
5729689	5730850	Well then what's the one you wanted to hear?
5730870	5734692	The one with, um, uh, what was that?
5734852	5735433	Release Your Mind.
5736633	5736753	Oh.
5737934	5738875	Yeah, it has to be TACC.
5740379	5742844	Alright guys, it's time to vote, chat room.
5743325	5748575	If I don't get at least five votes, and please don't vote unless you feel like you heard enough of each song to make a decent vote.
5750148	5756090	If we don't get five votes in the chat room, the real room here, the live room will vote instead.
5756230	5759591	So that's why we haven't heard what the guests think of the song chat because they may vote on them.
5760132	5762232	So let's hear a little recap.
5762272	5766554	I'm going to play a little bit extended recaps than I usually do because of the buffering issues.
5766954	5770435	And so you guys all have a chance to listen one more time because I know you are, right?
5770515	5770815	Okay.
5771536	5772196	Yeah, exactly.
5773308	5777295	So, a little bit of extended clips here, but just enough so you can get an idea of what's going on.
5777635	5778016	Here we go.
5778096	5782142	First up, last week's winner, song number one, Foggy, Come Into My Dream.
5814941	5819245	Alright, song number two, Free Fall, featuring Jan Johnston with Skydive.
5819705	5820226	Here it is.
5822107	5823849	Free Fall
5854386	5859137	Alright, song number three you can vote for tonight is Loki vs. Deep Project with the Fly 2003 mix.
5888555	5897066	All right, so those of you in the room, go ahead and write it down on the paper, the one you want to vote for, and fold your paper in half, and then we'll look at them in a little bit.
5898768	5902413	Otherwise, chat room, if you guys were able to follow us, place votes now.
5906348	5908029	over a private message to Sky in the chatroom.
5908950	5917915	Anyways, you wanted me to mention this because I mentioned this the other day, and because it's also one of the songs I sampled, which I might add was not very remixed, but it, whatever.
5918255	5920517	You know, I added, like, a better drum beat to it, and that's it.
5920737	5921297	Whoop-dee-doo.
5921757	5932324	Anyways, so anyways, I was going to mention that F-Zero GX has three songs that sample the song, or actually three songs that are remixes of the song The Fly by The Deep Project.
5933465	5940360	Which also, you might remember, was also sampled in The Legend of Max Which, shut up
5940882	5942482	You're not even on mic, so shut up.
5942943	5943263	Shut up.
5943703	5943943	Shut up.
5944023	5944523	Okay, anyways.
5944903	5948604	So, I was going to play clips from the three songs.
5949545	5950025	Let's see here.
5950065	5958427	Let's start off with the first one, which was... Basically, these are all the character music for the characters in F-Zero GX.
5958828	5962309	We'll start off with Deathborn, which is one of the characters.
5962729	5965710	We've played this for my... Let's see, anyways.
5967530	5969891	Why did not Louie... Okay, here we go.
5974264	5982050	Deathborn, that's a remix of a fly, believe it or not, which is kind of neat.
5982110	5989215	And then we've also got Blood Falcons theme, which was the one that I remixed, barely.
5991277	5992077	I know it sucked.
5994459	5997962	And it's probably a lot better without the crap they threw on top of it.
5999107	6000467	But anyways, that's Blood Falcon's theme.
6000507	6003809	And then we have Black Shadow's theme, which I wanted the remix, but it just didn't work.
6004409	6017353	So, um... Anyways, I just thought I'd mention that, because that was kind of neat.
6018954	6019314	Whatever.
6020734	6022615	F-Zero rocks, because it's fast.
6023675	6027717	But, um... Yeah, I admit, I know that... I knew full, uh...
6029338	6035280	I knew from the get-go that that remix wasn't that great, and I was going to throw it in there anyways, because I just didn't care.
6037121	6039482	Be glad I didn't choose the chicken dance or something like that.
6041543	6041963	Oh, Rob.
6042523	6042744	What?
6042984	6043984	Speaking of the chicken dance.
6044704	6044884	Yes.
6044904	6047445	You should play that for the pre-show and during the break.
6048506	6048646	Okay.
6048726	6050107	I'm standing there just for our chat room.
6050127	6053128	Of course, the chat room can't really hear tonight.
6054068	6054548	Too bad.
6055149	6056269	It'll be on the... The replay.
6056309	6058330	The replay.
6060228	6066813	Alright, I only got one vote for Cage Match from the chat room, so I think we're going to go ahead and reveal the winner here, okay?
6067654	6069255	Alright, I'm interested in your votes.
6069275	6071656	Here we go, everybody got them, I got five, so here we go.
6075499	6076340	Who is the winner?
6078522	6079762	Don't juggle the ferrets!
6079903	6085687	I wish I had the Survivor Tribal Council song here, but I don't have it, so I've got to find another song to fill in here.
6087608	6088628	Play the chicken dance, Rob.
6090429	6091489	There's neighbors out there.
6096151	6097231	I got something even better.
6099072	6099452	All right.
6099472	6099932	Match game.
6100572	6101073	Here he goes.
6101553	6102213	First vote.
6102633	6104174	70s porn, fabulous.
6105874	6108115	The first vote is for whatever Loki's was called.
6109596	6110816	So that's song number three.
6115838	6116338	Next vote.
6119710	6124554	Second song, the one that wasn't Foggy or Loki, so one vote for second song, one vote for third song.
6128957	6133921	It can't be a tie with five people, impossible, unless somebody didn't write a vote.
6135282	6138745	Song number three, so Loki's song has two votes, Jamie's song has one vote.
6146493	6149015	Ah, here's a vote for song one, coming to my dreams.
6149075	6154078	So now we have one vote for song one, one vote for song two, and two votes for song three.
6154238	6156240	It is possible to have a tie with five votes.
6156540	6156700	It is.
6156720	6157461	Two and two and one.
6157701	6163264	Right, we might have a tie right here, but that's okay because remember, in case of a tie, the host picks.
6163785	6165006	The host who didn't get picks.
6165366	6166527	So here it is, the last vote.
6167607	6169849	So if it's a vote for song three, song three wins.
6169889	6172531	If it's a vote for song one or two, we have a tie.
6172671	6172911	Ready?
6176865	6179627	Ah, it's a vote for song number one.
6180448	6186453	So, we have a tie between Foggy and Loki's pick, song number three.
6186613	6189075	So, Jamie... Who should I vote for?
6189095	6189175	What?
6189575	6190576	Who should I vote for?
6190636	6191737	Who should you vote for?
6191757	6192477	Harwick!
6194539	6197941	Marin tried to send a vote in for... I am getting some votes from the chat room.
6197961	6198442	Do you want to hear?
6198482	6198902	Do you want to hear?
6198922	6199363	Add them in.
6199383	6200383	Add them in?
6200724	6201524	Well, this is what's interesting.
6201544	6202285	Okay, we're going to add them in.
6205004	6207066	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
6231638	6233019	voted for song number two.
6233139	6235641	So now we have a tie between song number two and Actdeft.
6237142	6237722	So that's it.
6237762	6239023	I haven't won in a long time.
6242726	6244126	Um, oh, that means I have to pick?
6245928	6247249	Um, I...
6253410	6254551	This is a tough decision.
6254591	6255592	This is a tough decision.
6255612	6256252	I'll tell you why.
6256353	6257714	I'll tell you why this is a tough decision.
6257994	6259876	Because Jamie hasn't won in a little while.
6260076	6262698	I've actually been winning the cage match lately, so she hasn't won in a while.
6262718	6264700	So I kind of feel bad, so I'm like, okay, maybe we should let Jamie win.
6264920	6265741	And I did like her song.
6266894	6270116	On the other hand, Loki put a lot of work into his song.
6270176	6273718	Jamie just gets a song from the internet, but Loki made his.
6273738	6277120	If you want to feel better, I didn't put that much effort into that.
6277220	6278061	Really, I did not.
6278221	6283084	It's better than what I... The song I picked, though, I was going to pick the Chicken Dance Techno Mix.
6283464	6283985	Oh, God.
6284265	6285866	I would have voted for that, no problem.
6286786	6286806	I...
6288027	6289268	I have a happy alternative.
6289308	6294272	How about we just take the song that I sampled for the Fly remix, since it's better anyways.
6294572	6297894	It's a lot cleaner, doesn't have the loud drumbeat over the top of it.
6298194	6299495	We'll use that instead of mine.
6300136	6300296	Huh?
6300376	6300596	Huh?
6300656	6300996	Huh?
6301056	6301296	Huh?
6303078	6306280	I'm thinking, I'm thinking I'm going to give it to Jamie tonight.
6308922	6309702	So there you go.
6309762	6310303	Where's the ferret?
6310383	6311263	I need to help the ferret.
6312304	6313205	The ferret, she needs to help.
6313265	6314826	She said she needs to help the ferret.
6315322	6315802	I heard it.
6315842	6317422	She said she needed to hump the ferret.
6321383	6324004	If you do, I will, um, beat you with the ferret.
6324064	6327785	Wait, what was that one that I said the other week that you said you haven't before?
6328605	6336046	There was something that last week or something that I said that, um, was, you know, bad or something.
6340187	6340607	I don't know.
6340787	6341728	Have a conversation.
6342208	6343708	And now we let the ferrets talk to you.
6355959	6359542	Alright, so there's the cage match, kind of a little bit fucked up.
6371690	6375413	Alright, I think, um, what do I talk about now?
6376334	6379116	Isn't there actually some Bimani news going on right now?
6379336	6379616	No.
6380397	6380957	Yes, there is.
6381057	6383219	I think Loki has something he wants to share with you all.
6384468	6385168	People still play that?
6385188	6385849	The money crap?
6387089	6387930	The modem's up.
6413087	6414288	I know, I was just being slow.
6414489	6422397	Anyways, there was, of course, they were showing off DDR Extreme, which we pretty much know is going to be exactly like Max 2 is right now.
6422437	6422898	What are you doing?
6425236	6426637	Party, Party Maker
6446926	6463100	Party Mix, I guess, uh, Dance Dance Revolution, um, Party Mix or something like that, let's see, I don't know, where'd it go, I just saw the link to this, um, where did Dark Tipsy get posted, there it is,
6464986	6467528	It's Dance Dance Revolution Party Collection.
6468308	6471431	In other words, I think it's Dance Dance Revolution Best Hits number two.
6473072	6477555	And you're pretty much going to have, you know, it looks like it's going to be based off the DDR Extreme Engine.
6477575	6483359	And, you know, they don't really show anything other than diet mode and, you know, standard beginner stuff.
6483379	6486661	So, it has beginner and diet mode.
6487742	6492446	Other than that, no, obviously, there's going to be, you know, DDR Max coming out next...
6493519	6494260	and so on.
6502614	6502894	What else?
6503235	6518750	Oh yeah, we've also got, kind of segueing into sim news, Step Mania is at 3.9 alpha 5, and so one thing that's fully supported now is the dance magic mode.
6519070	6520531	That's fully supported now.
6521452	6522573	It works, it's done.
6525057	6532036	Another thing I thought I'd mention, because a lot of sim sites are down, and you can't find your sim file.
6535504	6556431	But now you can go find all your official sim files at www.ddramerica.com slash bttracker and you'll have all your torrents for every single batch collection of files that was featured on DDRUK.
6558472	6559313	Go check them out.
6559333	6561154	They've got tons of stuff.
6561474	6562034	Everything.
6562295	6563736	All your official stuff.
6564196	6566237	I pissed my pants when I saw this site.
6567138	6569639	I didn't because I already had all of it years ago.
6570119	6571200	Well, good for you.
6572301	6574602	They just made so many for the Mac work finally.
6574882	6577584	I'm a little behind, thank you very much.
6579565	6581066	Yeah, the Mac's always behind.
6584691	6586952	Anyways... One second, go!
6588112	6588773	Okay, got it.
6589553	6590954	Ferret tail sack on the cab.
6592954	6594135	Hot ferret action!
6594315	6600057	Yeah, that's pretty much that, and, um... In other news, my cabinet's coming along quite nicely.
6601198	6602118	That's it, yeah.
6602778	6604039	That's all your boomani news.
6604479	6612482	Oh, and, um... Yeah, TAC did something, and... And, uh... And Jamie perks up like a cat.
6614956	6615756	What did my man do?
6616056	6617117	I still had to marry him, you know.
6618018	6620020	Well, actually, I was going to mention this.
6621921	6623642	I'm trying to remember where I saw it.
6623743	6624943	I think it was Bomani Style.
6625124	6626164	Oh, I say Bomani Style.
6627966	6629367	Thanks, I forgot about that.
6629987	6632930	F you to Bomani Style for putting music on your front page.
6633010	6633831	You suck.
6634731	6635712	What are you thinking?
6636132	6640076	Seriously, okay, now, we really, really like Bomani Style.
6640116	6641497	We do, Loki, we do.
6642268	6642388	TAC?
6642408	6642508	TAC?
6673067	6674028	on, uh, yeah.
6674328	6686201	So, but anyways, I was gonna say that, um, there's that, um, what was it, that Beatmania concert live thingy, 2DX, yeah, 2DX Secret Concert.
6687105	6688225	Super Secret Concert.
6688345	6696388	Anyways, that was going on, and supposedly there was some new songs brought out for that.
6696768	6698608	I'm trying to see if I can pull this up here.
6698628	6702930	I just want to say really quickly, because Jamie's going, what, huh?
6703350	6710092	If you actually read, there's a big, long post on Mamadi Style where they talked about where they're taking down the media, and basically...
6710672	6723643	Most people kind of know by now that read the forums frequently of Imani Style that TAC has been in touch with the people that run ImaniStyle.com and that they were going to try and find a way to distribute Bounce Connected in the U.S.
6723743	6725164	through ImaniStyle.com.
6726025	6738095	And somehow along the way, though, it's kind of been inferred, and I haven't seen a confirmation in this thread of this or whatever, but somehow it got around that TAC actually asked that the media be stopped.
6738775	6739036	So...
6740003	6747389	Which is interesting because I had also heard that he didn't mind so much because he was excited that people outside of Japan liked his music so much.
6747869	6749451	So, I don't know.
6750412	6752513	And he's actually planning on having a real release over here.
6752874	6755496	Yeah, it could be a combination of things though.
6755636	6760200	Also, if you look in this thread, you read a lot about bandwidth whores and things like that.
6760240	6762581	People that just leech all day long and stuff.
6762621	6767926	And they kind of want to explore other parts of what they could do with a money style other than just being a leech that he plays.
6768526	6769167	That makes sense.
6769467	6774970	Anyways, I was going to say that the 2DX Secret Live Party performances, here is the playlist for the performances.
6775470	6785917	You had set one, which is by Tack, and he did Abstract, Electro-Tunes, Schlagwerk, Stoic, Holic, DXY, Quasar, and Traces, so that was kind of neat.
6786117	6786177	Aww.
6786617	6792742	And then you have Slake was set 2, did Breeding, Music to Your Head, and a new song which is untitled right now.
6793823	6801950	Set 3 was done by Wack, which did Linus, Spica, Over the Clouds, and Regulus, Make a Difference, Murmur Twins, Linus, and Moonchild.
6802671	6806013	And then Akira Yamaoka did...
6807074	6808434	I would have wet my panties
6836880	6844843	Tomorrow's Perfume, Colors, Pandora, the new song by DJ Taka, Motion 2003, and Rainbow Flyer, the vocal version.
6844963	6849205	So that was kind of neat, and hopefully we'll get MP3s of those new songs soon.
6849325	6854547	And the vocal version of Rainbow Flyer was actually not done by Sana, it was done by Noria, was actually there.
6854647	6860209	Noria being the one that did Glorious Days and the Happy Handbag song in Einstein, I can't remember what the hell it's called.
6861465	6874788	and Platonic XXX is supposed to sound like a Japanese version of Secret Rendezvous with rapping.
6874808	6875928	What?
6876828	6877048	Yeah.
6878528	6879049	With rapping.
6879329	6881849	So I know that means it's probably going to be in the next DDR, so I mean, that's kind of cool.
6881869	6884770	I don't know if that's a bad thing.
6884790	6885790	I mean, it's not bad.
6885810	6886510	I mean, it's
6888351	6889171	Sylvia Drive.
6889452	6890572	That's what I was trying to think of.
6890592	6891652	Sylvia Drive.
6891693	6892513	I love that.
6893133	6897595	That's a great signature right there.
6898696	6901317	Nigga stole my bike.
6903858	6904118	Sorry.
6905719	6907039	It's from Mike Tyson's punchline.
6907079	6907920	Oh, no, no, no.
6908400	6909200	That's what it was.
6909880	6911401	It wasn't Lion Suki in the other song.
6911421	6914062	It was Lion Suki in the theme to Metal Gear Solid.
6914082	6915243	Oh, yeah, that's right, that's right, that's right.
6916283	6917584	Which I would love...
6920342	6922964	Where did God, you guys, try to kill me?
6923484	6924444	It's your fault, Loki.
6924464	6927326	It's not my fault because you keep walking around me.
6940094	6946217	The switch is supposed to stay on on the microphone and the far microphone is supposed to stay far away and the close microphone is supposed to stay close.
6948539	6948719	Give me...
6952990	6954490	Yes, Ritz.
6955431	6956571	Ritz are mine.
6957691	6958292	God damn it.
6958332	6959392	I want Nilla Wafers now.
6961873	6964073	And you get like two and a half crackers.
6964113	6966154	Yes, this will do nicely.
6966434	6967774	And Eric can have the empty box.
6968354	6969775	Oh yeah, you know you like it.
6974036	6975056	Snap into a Ritz.
6977757	6979477	F you the Pringles, because they suck.
6980078	6981038	It tastes like crap.
6982823	6984023	The original Pringles suck.
6984283	6984644	No, no, no.
6985004	6988865	The original Pringles, Pringles now, Pringles in the future will all suck.
6990365	6994566	And FD the Lays for trying to copy Pringles and put their stuff in a can.
6994786	6997487	That's because you put your chippies in a can, it does not make them any better.
6997567	6998407	Pringles.
6998527	7000267	And what is up with Pib Extra?
7000547	7002028	What is extra about Pib Extra?
7002088	7003528	It tastes exactly the same.
7003808	7004588	I have no idea.
7012079	7027413	BasicPhysicsAaron, Ling, Box, FerretBow Insert Ferret into Ritzbox Insert Ferret towards end of Ritzbox Fling Ritzbox, Ferret flies Are we done about news?
7028294	7033920	I'm done I'm thinking you guys What do you guys think about just make Where'd Jamie go?
7034966	7037068	What are you guys thinking about just making it a two hour show tonight?
7038008	7038689	Just like old days.
7039850	7046495	Because we have no listeners, we're pretty much done with a lot of our topics, can't really interact with the chat room tonight, so.
7047295	7050077	We're pretty much dead in the water, and we can all thank Comcast for that.
7050458	7050798	Cunts.
7051934	7055556	No listeners, huh?
7055776	7056737	Not very many listeners?
7056817	7066723	No, I mean, no, we have... God bless the chatroom, they're trying to get in, they're hammering to get in, they're just trying their best to... Stop ramming the stream!
7067824	7071066	Everyone give a fuck you to Live365 for this sucking.
7071226	7076549	No, no, no, it's not Live365, it's Comcast and Live365's link is fucked up.
7077690	7079571	So, it's more Comcast's fault.
7080609	7082691	Live 365 should be over the handle being hammered.
7083151	7089476	They're a freaking internet radio station that hosts thousands and thousands of internet radio channels.
7089496	7089977	What are you doing?
7090117	7092179	Oh, they're playing with my erotic poetry.
7092259	7093239	Jamie's reading erotic poetry.
7094741	7097923	So I'm going to go around at this time and get everyone's final thoughts.
7098884	7100666	Dude, read the erotic poetry.
7100686	7101786	Oh, read the erotic poetry first.
7103988	7108212	So Jamie has written, your vagina breath blows.
7109637	7112559	I have written, you suck enormous cock.
7114039	7116601	And now we're waiting for Jamie to do another thing.
7117221	7122984	My girlfriend wrote, and this is, let me, um, this, a dirty dog's, um, hey, what happened?
7125025	7125966	You took enormous cock.
7125986	7129028	Okay, a dirty dog's enormous cock plunged into my ass.
7129088	7131409	I swallowed his wiggling shaft, smeared...
7133882	7137504	and smeared his pudding on my pink pussy.
7138284	7139204	Your vagina blows.
7139265	7141846	Okay, that doesn't make any sense now because there's stuff being removed.
7144547	7146648	Then I put velvet jelly love juice.
7149850	7150190	Alright.
7150910	7152731	Let's get final thoughts.
7152751	7157114	We're going to start today with I'll start final thoughts with Andrew.
7160735	7161816	You don't pay me enough to think.
7164286	7169648	Shane, thank you so much for being here tonight, and I'm sorry that Comcast sucks a big fat cock.
7169688	7173370	Yeah, I meant to give them an FU just to be cool like everybody else, but I forgot.
7173570	7174490	But thank you for being here.
7174690	7175211	Oh, thank you.
7175491	7176731	And I hope you had fun anyway.
7176991	7177231	I did.
7177512	7177712	Good.
7178372	7179472	We enjoyed Dance Summit, by the way.
7179492	7179833	It was fun.
7180013	7180613	Yeah, it's cool.
7181073	7182754	So, we'll see you.
7182994	7185816	It sounds like we may see you on Wednesday here for the Max 2 show.
7185856	7187957	Yes, instead of being San Fran anymore.
7188297	7188938	Just cry.
7189618	7190078	Sadness.
7190599	7192400	You can come over for Vanilla Sky if you want tomorrow.
7192600	7193700	Okay, I'll have nothing better to do.
7193720	7194401	All right, we'll see.
7194421	7195081	We'll get somewhere.
7195101	7196762	Hopefully, hopefully I can do that show.
7197342	7197803	We'll see.
7199223	7201165	Joey, thanks for being here again.
7201485	7201985	No problem.
7202565	7203526	And a final thought?
7204456	7205416	Uh, not really.
7205697	7207417	Congratulations on the three-footer once again, then.
7207437	7208097	Thank you.
7208937	7213899	That means, you know what, if you keep at this pace, next week will be six-footers, and three weeks you'll have the cattas down.
7213919	7215439	You'll be just like us, just like that.
7218240	7220641	I don't think I can work that magic, but I'll sure try.
7221994	7222454	Puppy.
7222975	7228637	Thanks for... Sorry I drive out here all the way from Davis for an under par show, but they're always interesting, aren't they?
7229818	7230098	Yeah.
7230919	7236101	At least I can actually know what's going on instead of having to sit at my computer and listen to the live station like everyone else.
7238403	7240444	This damn signal thing annoys me.
7241944	7243065	Yeah.
7243225	7245106	Alright.
7245686	7247987	Aaron, thanks for coming.
7248168	7248428	Sorry...
7249594	7254018	Sorry Erin that your first show had to be kind of a weird one, but you can thank Comcast for that.
7254499	7254799	It's cool.
7254959	7256261	But I have a feeling you'll be back.
7257096	7257576	This puppy.
7257956	7258296	Good.
7259017	7259477	Good.
7259497	7260157	I'm glad to hear it.
7260337	7262198	Actually, I forgot to add one last FU.
7262558	7263738	I kind of thought of it right now.
7263798	7264338	Oh, what the hell.
7264379	7264799	Go for it.
7265139	7268340	It was to, uh, the Scanny went to, was it Sacramento's?
7268360	7269320	Yes.
7269360	7273602	Sacramento's for, uh, having a fucked up right side pad.
7274022	7276843	Because, yeah, on Max 2.
7277363	7280484	I don't know why, but I ended up failing the Whistle Song Maniac.
7281804	7282225	How?
7282425	7282965	I don't know.
7286129	7292353	And Jamie wrote another piece of erotic poetry, Taste Her Nasty Burning Crack Cream.
7296256	7297457	I don't want to know, but yeah.
7298578	7301940	So, fuck Scandia for really fucked up pads.
7303201	7307164	And stupid teeny bopperish ghetto, quote unquote, ghetto people.
7307324	7309105	And the retards.
7309466	7310386	And the retards.
7313869	7314209	And yeah.
7316243	7317485	Jamie, your final thought.
7319147	7320048	Loki, your final thought.
7321951	7323453	My mouth is full of cracker.
7324555	7326097	No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
7328149	7329751	My final thought is this.
7330592	7331573	We live in America.
7331893	7338080	It's about competition, being a capitalist society, making money at the expense of other people.
7338760	7345728	I beg you, anybody that's out there listening, Sure West, AT&T, well not AT&T because that's technically part of Comcast.
7346048	7348371	Sure West, anybody out there that's listening,
7349383	7354569	Build a competitive cable company in this area and bring it out here to where we live.
7354969	7355630	WinFirst.
7355990	7357312	God please anyone.
7357392	7359614	WinFirst got bought by SureWest too.
7360395	7362577	Do all these companies have to keep fucking buying each other out?
7362918	7367483	Except if you have WinFirst you can't look at DeviantArt so don't go with them.
7368404	7371207	And you might not see it on the webcam but I just took off my pants.
7376369	7376970	They banned it.
7377550	7385058	They blocked anyone with that ISP for actually going in and saving the pictures off their site.
7386879	7390283	I beg any other competing cable company out there, please.
7391069	7395273	Please come out here and give Comcast some competition.
7395514	7396955	They have a monopoly on the market.
7397075	7398797	This is the problem that we have.
7399218	7402241	The reason why this sucks, you guys, I would not put up with this shit.
7402621	7404003	Going through Live 65 and Comcast.
7404263	7408227	You guys remember... It's actually very good in the... I'm talking Dish.
7408568	7409629	You can't get Win First out here.
7412786	7415947	I've used their service at my friend's house and it's really good service.
7417007	7423930	Assuming that Loki and I move again in April, which I'm thinking is probably going to be the case, I think we're going to go somewhere where we can get DSL instead of cable.
7423970	7424670	Move closer!
7426531	7427251	We'll see, we'll see.
7427771	7428591	Or buy me gas.
7429652	7429992	We'll see.
7430712	7433033	DSL is not supported up here.
7440137	7442178	All right, I'm done.
7442218	7442518	That's it.
7442638	7445339	I just beg somebody compete with Comcast, please.
7445519	7446499	I need another option.
7446719	7449240	I don't like this monopoly they have on the market on high-speed internet.
7449340	7449620	Loki.
7451641	7451821	What?
7452581	7453061	Final thought.
7453381	7454422	Oh, I have to contribute, actually.
7454502	7455462	Oh, I had a final thought.
7455862	7456142	Loki.
7457863	7458103	What?
7458883	7460524	Here's my contribution to your cabinet.
7463745	7464725	I got more change.
7464745	7465265	We could.
7469031	7472252	I want my coin to be the first one in the coin slot.
7472272	7473372	Sorry, I already put one in there.
7477113	7477893	That's what it is.
7479134	7480134	For kind donations.
7481534	7482214	Money for me.
7483475	7488256	No, my final thought is, why does the sun have to be so hot?
7490377	7491017	Because it is.
7491297	7491617	I don't know.
7493237	7494959	It's because it's a big nuclear tank.
7494999	7498644	What do you get when you cross a bungee cord with an owl?
7499705	7500546	My ass.
7502935	7505075	All right, final word of the show.
7505856	7509896	I'm going to give it to Shane because, for God's sakes, he came how far out here.
7509916	7511677	I didn't give my final thought.
7511717	7512457	You should do it, didn't you?
7512557	7515958	My final thought is my foot repeatedly kicking your butt.
7516618	7516978	I'm done.
7517618	7519318	By the way, in regards to my F.U.
7519338	7523439	of the week, again, I'm not really pissed off at that site.
7523819	7524840	I'm pissed off at that person.
7525880	7530041	And I freaking hate people who abuse their power, so I hope that he catches SARS of the genitals.
7532438	7535481	Oh, I just want to say another F you to people that play this game.
7536082	7537523	I know something you don't know.
7537923	7539245	I know something you don't know.
7539345	7540626	I fucking hate that shit.
7541507	7542948	I know something you don't know.
7543289	7544670	I know something you don't know.
7545851	7547533	I probably know lots of things y'all don't know.
7547933	7553719	But see, it's one thing to know it and keep it a secret that you know it, but it's another thing... You know what?
7553739	7555521	I'm never telling you what the quadratic formula is.
7555921	7556221	Never.
7558507	7565393	It's another thing to be all like openly admitting you know shit and you're just being a dick and not wanting to share it for whatever reason.
7565413	7566654	I know where the antidote is.
7568256	7569417	For your mental retardation?
7569857	7570017	No.
7571338	7572640	Ooh, he go nasty.
7572700	7573420	He get nasty.
7573440	7575582	Do you really know what happened if you take the other pill?
7577944	7578725	The birth control pill?
7580306	7580647	I don't know.
7580667	7581568	Do you know something about that?
7581768	7581828	No.
7587479	7597063	I have to say this.
7597503	7598803	I was on birth control for a little while.
7599183	7602785	It made me an insane psycho bitch, but I had really good skin.
7603465	7604005	There you go.
7608976	7611697	If you take the red pill, I'll show you how deep this hole goes.
7612897	7615258	If you take the blue pill, I'll give you an erection.
7620259	7621099	Right, anyway.
7621479	7624820	Wait, hold on, no, we can't have final word yet because I don't have the end of the show queued up.
7626721	7627481	I'm with it today.
7627521	7630402	You know what, this is just one of those, I'm just writing this show off.
7630562	7636463	You guys, you know how like big companies when they discover like million dollar debts they have and stuff, they just write it off?
7637164	7637804	Enron, yeah.
7638723	7640884	I think you guys were just writing the night off.
7641024	7644004	This one needs to be like the lost episode.
7644524	7645125	Seriously.
7647385	7648966	This is one of the other lost episodes.
7649446	7651866	Jamie dubs this as a lost episode.
7651946	7657708	It was lost and caught the void, the big hole, cavernous vagina that is Comcast.
7661753	7668822	Unfortunately, the end of this show was lost on its way overseas, but it was finished by the Korean recording artists.
7669703	7670544	Hope you enjoy.
7670964	7675550	For those keeping score at home, I just showed another dropout on Live365.
7675750	7678733	That's 36 dropouts tonight, you guys, during the show.
7679034	7679795	We dropped 36 times.
7682509	7684732	We really need one more for that.
7685513	7686254	One more drop.
7686754	7687435	One more drop.
7688196	7688597	Come on.
7689578	7690439	Come on, motherfucker.
7690479	7692842	Let me bog down computer resources.
7692902	7694244	Come on, get it to drop again.
7694264	7694844	Come on, we need 37.
7695425	7696747	We need 37 in a row.
7696787	7697828	Come on, boy, come on.
7698769	7699811	Aaron has something she wanted to say.
7702475	7709580	You know, I really wonder if we'll ever find a cock large enough to rape Comcast in the ass for everything they've done to us tonight.
7710440	7712582	I don't know, but I'd be willing to try.
7714743	7717725	I'm sorry, I don't think you're large enough.
7719567	7722689	I think it would have to be a collective cock.
7723770	7725211	One cock together.
7728926	7734851	I think the cock has to be at least large enough so that in proportion to testicles should be about as large as beanbag chairs.
7735331	7738013	Uh, we could, we could, we could get Pauly Terry and give it a try.
7738033	7744958	One more?
7744998	7747320	Okay, Rob's over here dragging us.
7747340	7750783	37 in a row?
7750803	7752884	37 drop.
7753104	7753865	Quick, end of show.
7753905	7754766	Shane, final word.
