00:07:54,053 --> 00:07:57,741
[SPEAKER_17]: Toto, I have a feeling we're not in Kansas anymore.

7
00:08:01,368 --> 00:08:06,149
[SPEAKER_29]: You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio, Ramani Talk, and then some.

8
00:08:06,849 --> 00:08:09,550
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, mostly the, and then some, part of that.

9
00:08:09,910 --> 00:08:13,951
[SPEAKER_29]: Orange Lounge Radio is created by a bunch of potty-mouthed adults.

10
00:08:14,551 --> 00:08:19,352
[SPEAKER_29]: Orange Lounge may contain sexual, perverted, and mildly retarded content.

11
00:08:19,932 --> 00:08:23,632
[SPEAKER_29]: You probably shouldn't let your children listen to Orange Lounge Radio.

12
00:08:23,953 --> 00:08:25,433
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, I will spank your child.

13
00:08:25,833 --> 00:08:27,573
[SPEAKER_15]: If you're not going to do your job, goddammit, I will.

14
00:08:29,694 --> 00:08:30,814
Spank your spanker!

15
00:08:32,165 --> 00:08:34,227
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, here's to my big opening.

16
00:08:34,747 --> 00:08:35,848
[SPEAKER_03]: A sphincter says what?

17
00:08:36,168 --> 00:08:38,150
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm super, thanks for asking.

18
00:08:38,530 --> 00:08:41,132
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, you little bitch troll from hell.

19
00:08:41,152 --> 00:08:43,094
[SPEAKER_22]: What am I doing here?

20
00:08:43,214 --> 00:08:44,415
[SPEAKER_22]: No.

21
00:08:44,996 --> 00:08:45,616
[SPEAKER_00]: Dodge this.

22
00:08:45,636 --> 00:08:48,659
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a tasty burger.

23
00:08:48,899 --> 00:08:51,361
[SPEAKER_26]: Look, you stupid bastard, you've got no arms left.

24
00:08:51,581 --> 00:08:52,202
[SPEAKER_26]: Yes, I have.

25
00:08:52,662 --> 00:08:54,443
[SPEAKER_26]: Look, just a flesh wound.

26
00:08:54,684 --> 00:09:00,829
[SPEAKER_10]: Searching for a boy in high school is as useless as searching for meaning in a Pauly Shore movie.

27
00:09:01,869 --> 00:09:02,569
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh yeah?

28
00:09:02,809 --> 00:09:06,110
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, I hope your babies look like monkeys.

29
00:09:06,351 --> 00:09:07,411
[SPEAKER_27]: DarkSakura.

30
00:09:07,611 --> 00:09:08,391
[SPEAKER_07]: I've got a sniff.

31
00:09:08,751 --> 00:09:09,312
[SPEAKER_07]: Skye.

32
00:09:09,392 --> 00:09:11,492
[SPEAKER_07]: But I'm playing it for the bartender, so suffer.

33
00:09:11,852 --> 00:09:12,333
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki.

34
00:09:12,633 --> 00:09:13,633
[SPEAKER_07]: I hate you!

35
00:09:14,053 --> 00:09:16,114

00:09:37,619 --> 00:09:38,119

00:09:55,644 --> 00:09:57,745
[SPEAKER_07]: Second drawer down, not including the cutting board.

43
00:09:58,845 --> 00:09:59,445
[SPEAKER_05]: There you go.

00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:17,928
[SPEAKER_05]: and now in the Orange Lounge kitchen, Iron Chef Sakura and the mystery ingredient today is rice oh shit the mystery food today is eel

45
00:10:20,552 --> 00:10:22,954
[SPEAKER_07]: What is someone cooking Asian food to do with rice?

46
00:10:23,475 --> 00:10:23,995
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

47
00:10:24,896 --> 00:10:25,917
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys want another microphone?

48
00:10:25,937 --> 00:10:26,778
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys can have this one here.

49
00:10:27,158 --> 00:10:28,199
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys might want this in a little bit.

50
00:10:31,282 --> 00:10:32,223
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, where was I?

[SPEAKER_07]: I'm playing with an eel.

58
00:10:57,830 --> 00:11:00,131
[SPEAKER_07]: In that corner, say hello to our tech massa, Loki.

59
00:11:01,052 --> 00:11:02,373
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm playing with a solder gun.

60
00:11:03,773 --> 00:11:04,614

[SPEAKER_07]: Or as I call her, ViolentHyperGangbang.

75
00:11:38,629 --> 00:11:41,391
[SPEAKER_10]: I think we have our whip again tonight because I forgot to take it out.

76
00:11:41,411 --> 00:11:42,371
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you not bring the whip?

77
00:11:42,651 --> 00:11:43,091
[SPEAKER_10]: It's there.

78
00:11:43,552 --> 00:11:43,652
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh.

79
00:11:47,569 --> 00:11:48,790
[SPEAKER_07]: No one can hear you, puppy.

80
00:11:48,810 --> 00:11:49,910
[SPEAKER_16]: It's only been a week.

81
00:11:54,973 --> 00:11:55,473
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

82
00:11:56,094 --> 00:11:59,356
[SPEAKER_07]: God, we have a whole shitload of Imani news to talk about this week.

83
00:11:59,496 --> 00:12:01,717
[SPEAKER_07]: Obviously, Max 2 came out this week in the U.S.

84
00:12:01,797 --> 00:12:03,338
[SPEAKER_07]: Did everybody here get the chance to play it?

85
00:12:03,998 --> 00:12:04,639
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

86
00:12:05,039 --> 00:12:05,199
[SPEAKER_07]: No?

87
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:06,339
[SPEAKER_07]: Everybody but Aaron.

88
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:07,180
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, well.

89
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:08,581
[SPEAKER_07]: Aaron will have to live vicariously through our stories.

90
00:12:08,601 --> 00:12:09,281
[SPEAKER_07]: It's okay.

91
00:12:09,361 --> 00:12:10,442
[SPEAKER_07]: You played Max 2.

92
00:12:10,862 --> 00:12:13,924
[SPEAKER_07]: I have... You got the first four unlocks, Loki.

93
00:12:13,944 --> 00:12:14,204
[SPEAKER_07]: Shut up.

94
00:12:15,324 --> 00:12:16,125
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, actually, if I...

95
00:12:17,290 --> 00:12:19,031
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll be talking about Max 2 USA tonight.

96
00:12:19,091 --> 00:12:24,372
[SPEAKER_07]: In fact, we have the Orange Lounge Radio premiere of all the Max 2 USA exclusives.

97
00:12:24,392 --> 00:12:25,993
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to be playing those throughout the show tonight.

98
00:12:26,953 --> 00:12:32,415
[SPEAKER_07]: And we ripped them ourselves, so... They're a little amateurish, but they got the job done.

99
00:12:32,615 --> 00:12:33,715
[SPEAKER_07]: Good job!

100
00:12:34,095 --> 00:12:38,997
[SPEAKER_07]: We got those and a whole lot of other stuff to talk about tonight, so we'll be back.

101
00:12:39,037 --> 00:12:42,478
[SPEAKER_07]: Cage match, possibly a list list if we have time for it.

102
00:12:43,038 --> 00:12:46,499
[SPEAKER_07]: All your favorite FUs of the week coming up a little bit later.

103
00:12:46,739 --> 00:12:46,879
[SPEAKER_07]: And...

104
00:12:48,095 --> 00:12:51,276
[SPEAKER_07]: Jamie Cooking, for all of you out there.

105
00:12:52,616 --> 00:12:55,117
[SPEAKER_07]: She'll be holding it up to the webcam and you can lick your screen.

106
00:12:55,717 --> 00:13:09,560
[SPEAKER_07]: So to get our webcam address, head on over to our website, www.callybomani.com, click on Orange Lounge, and click on Chat, and then our chat room will be more than happy to give you the link to the webcam, because it's got a really long URL and I don't say it over the air.

107
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:11,921
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, we'll be back after this.

108
00:13:11,961 --> 00:13:16,342
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to start off with a little bit of ecstasy, bad routine, and busy child.

109
00:13:16,362 --> 00:13:16,802
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll be back.

110
00:13:20,994 --> 00:13:30,666
[SPEAKER_18]: A little better you and me A little better set you free A little better

111
00:14:08,115 --> 00:14:09,716
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll be your dream

112
00:14:56,897 --> 00:14:58,812
[SPEAKER_18]: A little bit of ecstasy

113
00:16:50,091 --> 00:16:50,551
[SPEAKER_01]: Get busy, child.

114
00:16:50,571 --> 00:16:50,891
Get busy, child.

115
00:16:50,911 --> 00:16:51,391
Get busy, child.

116
00:17:22,929 --> 00:17:23,893
[SPEAKER_21]: Get this inside!

117
00:17:26,548 --> 00:17:27,629
[SPEAKER_21]: Get 50,000 Get 50,000 Get 50,000 Get 50,000 Get 50,000

118
00:18:06,567 --> 00:18:15,250
[SPEAKER_22]: Please listen to Orange Lounge Radio Because real radio makes Captain Jack cry

119
00:18:38,311 --> 00:18:41,513
[SPEAKER_07]: Hello and welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 62.

120
00:18:42,053 --> 00:18:44,754
[SPEAKER_07]: And we're playing Max 2 USA MP3s tonight.

121
00:18:44,814 --> 00:18:47,756
[SPEAKER_07]: So in that break you heard A Little Bit of Ecstasy, Bad Routine, and Busy Child.

122
00:18:47,776 --> 00:18:49,037
[SPEAKER_07]: We're just going to hit them in alphabetic order.

123
00:18:49,077 --> 00:18:50,437
[SPEAKER_07]: We've got 15 songs to play tonight.

124
00:18:51,038 --> 00:18:54,860
[SPEAKER_07]: Five breaks we usually do, so we'll have just enough to put us through the rest of the show.

125
00:18:56,020 --> 00:18:59,862
[SPEAKER_07]: So, speaking of Max 2 USA, it's the big news this week, Wednesday.

126
00:19:00,102 --> 00:19:03,143
[SPEAKER_07]: We haven't had a new DDR game in the USA for over a year.

127
00:19:03,203 --> 00:19:06,625
[SPEAKER_07]: We haven't really seen any new DDR of any kind, unless you live in Europe.

128
00:19:06,965 --> 00:19:09,907
[SPEAKER_07]: You haven't seen any new DDR of any kind since Extreme in January.

129
00:19:09,927 --> 00:19:11,427
[SPEAKER_07]: So this is like big news this week.

130
00:19:11,988 --> 00:19:13,828
[SPEAKER_07]: So, what'd you guys think?

131
00:19:14,889 --> 00:19:16,430
[SPEAKER_08]: Best damn home version ever.

132
00:19:17,350 --> 00:19:17,610
[SPEAKER_08]: Why?

133
00:19:18,771 --> 00:19:23,633
[SPEAKER_08]: Because it's got so many licensed tracks that are unique to the game that they actually...

134
00:19:24,838 --> 00:19:28,860
[SPEAKER_08]: Put some thought into what songs to put in and actually did a good job of it.

135
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:31,421
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh yeah, but this is better.

136
00:19:31,961 --> 00:19:38,004
[SPEAKER_08]: Max 2 is 20 times better.

137
00:19:38,724 --> 00:19:39,444
[SPEAKER_08]: Spine, whatever.

138
00:19:40,945 --> 00:19:41,485
[SPEAKER_07]: It is good.

139
00:19:41,505 --> 00:19:42,526
[SPEAKER_08]: Any particular favorites?

140
00:19:44,166 --> 00:19:47,928
[SPEAKER_07]: They had Xenon in it and I pissed my pants when I unlocked it.

141
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:51,652
[SPEAKER_07]: You didn't spoil, I went and spoiled the list.

142
00:19:51,812 --> 00:19:54,334
[SPEAKER_07]: I went on Wednesday morning and read the whole damn list.

143
00:19:54,414 --> 00:19:55,275
[SPEAKER_07]: I just wanted to know.

144
00:19:55,375 --> 00:19:56,616
[SPEAKER_07]: I wanted to know what the hell was in the game.

145
00:19:57,516 --> 00:20:07,604
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't even go online Wednesday until like the night when I was halfway through unlocking it when I was going to go online and see how far you guys were into it.

146
00:20:08,717 --> 00:20:09,077
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

147
00:20:09,377 --> 00:20:11,099
[SPEAKER_07]: Hopefully you were listening to us on Wednesday.

148
00:20:11,139 --> 00:20:11,639
[SPEAKER_07]: We were playing live.

149
00:20:11,659 --> 00:20:12,219
[SPEAKER_15]: I didn't even care.

150
00:20:12,239 --> 00:20:13,600
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't care if it's a spoiler or not.

151
00:20:14,041 --> 00:20:14,581
[SPEAKER_15]: Two words.

152
00:20:15,341 --> 00:20:16,342
[SPEAKER_15]: Tomorrow Perfume.

153
00:20:16,502 --> 00:20:16,982
[SPEAKER_15]: That's it.

154
00:20:17,123 --> 00:20:19,664
[SPEAKER_07]: Tomorrow Perfume was an excellent choice for an unlock to the game.

155
00:20:19,864 --> 00:20:20,405
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, it was.

156
00:20:21,185 --> 00:20:24,788
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to start off with a bitch, and it's my one bitch about Max 2 USA.

157
00:20:24,908 --> 00:20:27,609
[SPEAKER_07]: Otherwise, the game is fucking fabulous, but this is my bitch.

158
00:20:28,950 --> 00:20:32,053
[SPEAKER_07]: Almost one out of every three songs has been in a USA release before.

159
00:20:32,193 --> 00:20:34,415
[SPEAKER_07]: Including, like, half the unlocks.

160
00:20:34,475 --> 00:20:36,836
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, when I unlocked Afranova... Okay, no.

161
00:20:36,876 --> 00:20:40,619
[SPEAKER_07]: When I unlocked Put Your Faith in Me, I about threw a brick through the TV, okay?

162
00:20:40,759 --> 00:20:44,282
[SPEAKER_07]: I was like, if Loki hadn't have bought this brand new TV, I would have put a brick through it.

163
00:20:44,823 --> 00:20:46,884
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I was just like, what the hell?

164
00:20:47,004 --> 00:20:48,105
[SPEAKER_07]: Put Your Faith in Me?

165
00:20:48,345 --> 00:20:49,266
[SPEAKER_07]: At least it wasn't the jazzy groove.

166
00:20:49,286 --> 00:20:52,889
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, if you're going to repeat something, repeat a good song.

167
00:20:53,869 --> 00:20:54,730
[SPEAKER_07]: That's my one bitch.

168
00:20:55,190 --> 00:20:58,173
[SPEAKER_07]: Otherwise, I like the game, but I just felt a little...

169
00:20:58,900 --> 00:20:59,641
[SPEAKER_07]: Cheated My Baby Mama

170
00:21:13,107 --> 00:21:22,913
[SPEAKER_07]: One of the coolest things, one of the things I freaking love about Max 2 USA is those fourth mix songs, Conga Feelin', Dream a Dream, In the Navy, third mix, fourth mix, whatever.

171
00:21:23,733 --> 00:21:25,494
[SPEAKER_07]: Those songs have been completely reinvented.

172
00:21:26,074 --> 00:21:28,756
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yes, the fact that they're in 60 frames a minute.

173
00:21:29,577 --> 00:21:31,379
[SPEAKER_07]: And they have background videos.

174
00:21:31,419 --> 00:21:34,602
[SPEAKER_07]: Background videos fucking rule.

175
00:21:34,762 --> 00:21:35,182
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yes.

176
00:21:35,362 --> 00:21:37,724
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm almost a little disappointed that there weren't more of them.

177
00:21:37,944 --> 00:21:40,707
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, I was a little surprised that, like, Heaven didn't have its video.

178
00:21:40,727 --> 00:21:42,849
[SPEAKER_31]: Yeah, I thought there would be a video for that.

179
00:21:43,229 --> 00:21:45,631
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, so they probably had licensing issue problems.

180
00:21:45,711 --> 00:21:45,951
[SPEAKER_07]: Fine.

181
00:21:46,332 --> 00:21:47,233
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, give it to them.

182
00:21:47,273 --> 00:21:47,453
[SPEAKER_07]: Fine.

183
00:21:47,473 --> 00:21:49,354
[SPEAKER_07]: They probably had to pay a lot more to license the videos.

184
00:21:50,575 --> 00:21:52,177
[SPEAKER_07]: The Days Go By video is pretty cool.

185
00:21:52,257 --> 00:21:52,697
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, it is.

186
00:21:53,878 --> 00:21:54,178
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I know.

187
00:21:54,238 --> 00:21:55,599
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki made the Rice Crunch Retreat.

188
00:21:57,879 --> 00:21:58,459
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll tell you what.

189
00:21:58,939 --> 00:22:00,740
[SPEAKER_07]: Favorite video.

190
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:02,801
[SPEAKER_07]: You know how many songs actually have music videos, though?

191
00:22:03,661 --> 00:22:04,641
[SPEAKER_07]: If you do the counting, six.

192
00:22:04,981 --> 00:22:06,001
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's only six.

193
00:22:06,241 --> 00:22:07,202
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I thought there were more than that.

194
00:22:07,282 --> 00:22:13,604
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the two Captain Jack songs, Conga Feelin', Whistle Song, Love at First Sight.

195
00:22:18,445 --> 00:22:21,566
[SPEAKER_07]: Days Go By, and Four Strings.

196
00:22:21,786 --> 00:22:23,707
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, maybe there is eight, because that's seven I just named.

197
00:22:23,767 --> 00:22:28,629
[SPEAKER_07]: Four Strings has a video, and then there's... Yeah, Four Strings has a video.

198
00:22:28,769 --> 00:22:32,671
[SPEAKER_07]: Four Strings has that video that has the trains in it and the green wall.

199
00:22:33,031 --> 00:22:37,573
[SPEAKER_07]: Nobody knew what video it was when you saw... Oh, yeah, you have to look at the Four Strings video.

200
00:22:38,233 --> 00:22:39,713
[SPEAKER_08]: The steps to that song are really good.

201
00:22:39,753 --> 00:22:41,814
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the one... You know how everybody thought... Look at the freezes.

202
00:22:42,134 --> 00:22:43,515
[SPEAKER_07]: You remember when the early, early...

203
00:22:45,106 --> 00:22:51,109
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki, you remember when the early, early pictures of Max 2 came out and they had the trains and everybody said it was Chemical Brothers Star Guitar?

204
00:22:51,430 --> 00:22:52,590
[SPEAKER_07]: It was actually the Four Strings video.

205
00:22:53,431 --> 00:22:53,851
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, whatever.

206
00:22:56,092 --> 00:22:58,413
[SPEAKER_07]: I was done with that game in one hour.

207
00:22:59,414 --> 00:23:01,695
[SPEAKER_07]: I was just like, eh, I'm over it.

208
00:23:01,775 --> 00:23:02,336
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what, though?

209
00:23:03,076 --> 00:23:06,838
[SPEAKER_07]: If we had, like, a working dance pad in here right now, I think I'd still be playing it every day for exercise.

210
00:23:06,858 --> 00:23:07,398
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yeah, doubles?

211
00:23:07,879 --> 00:23:08,139
[SPEAKER_07]: Awesome.

212
00:23:10,238 --> 00:23:15,858
[SPEAKER_07]: My ignition pad, mine, that I got as an alimony payment.

213
00:23:17,751 --> 00:23:21,174
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, and we've heard about that pad so many times already, we don't need to hear it again.

214
00:23:21,194 --> 00:23:22,175
[SPEAKER_07]: You're right, we don't need to hear it again.

215
00:23:22,695 --> 00:23:27,199
[SPEAKER_08]: But, I mean, just the random old non-stop is keeping me playing it every day.

216
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:31,102
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what, if I had a dance pad to play it on, not just controller, I'd be playing it every day too.

217
00:23:31,383 --> 00:23:40,570
[SPEAKER_07]: And you know what's weird, is I think between this, and I'm going to get into this later, between this and RVGL's recent turnaround, I'm like totally into DDR again, it's scary.

218
00:23:41,851 --> 00:23:50,317
[SPEAKER_08]: Except for the whole wobbly pad thing on Extreme and RVGL, I played one game on it and I was like... Other comments on Max 2.

219
00:23:50,637 --> 00:23:52,218
[SPEAKER_07]: You haven't been able to play it yet, Aaron, right?

220
00:23:52,498 --> 00:23:54,879
[SPEAKER_07]: Hopefully during a break we'll be able to sneak it on so you can see it.

221
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:57,001
[SPEAKER_07]: Favorite video?

222
00:23:57,361 --> 00:23:57,641
[SPEAKER_07]: Puppy.

223
00:23:58,061 --> 00:23:58,582
[SPEAKER_07]: Favorite video?

224
00:23:58,862 --> 00:23:59,602
[SPEAKER_07]: Favorite video?

225
00:24:01,243 --> 00:24:01,584
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's see.

226
00:24:02,764 --> 00:24:03,705
[SPEAKER_08]: I have to go with...

227
00:24:05,872 --> 00:24:06,793
[SPEAKER_08]: In the Navy video.

228
00:24:07,873 --> 00:24:11,214
[SPEAKER_07]: I would say it's a tie because I love Conga Phelan.

229
00:24:11,374 --> 00:24:12,335
[SPEAKER_07]: I love Vivian.

230
00:24:12,635 --> 00:24:13,815
[SPEAKER_07]: She's a fat Shakira.

231
00:24:14,235 --> 00:24:14,816
[SPEAKER_07]: I love her.

232
00:24:15,576 --> 00:24:19,197
[SPEAKER_07]: But Dream of Dream is so cool too, like the flying car.

233
00:24:20,478 --> 00:24:22,259
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a flying car in the Dream of Dream video.

234
00:24:22,299 --> 00:24:22,739
[SPEAKER_07]: It's awesome.

235
00:24:23,259 --> 00:24:25,420
[SPEAKER_07]: I think I have to say Conga Phelan though because like...

236
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:32,868
[SPEAKER_07]: They changed... One thing you may not know if you haven't picked up Max 2 USA yet, they changed all the backgrounds for the fourth mix and before songs that have videos.

237
00:24:33,188 --> 00:24:36,792
[SPEAKER_07]: So Conga Feelin', Dream of Dream, they all have new backgrounds that are stills from the music video.

238
00:24:37,112 --> 00:24:40,396
[SPEAKER_07]: The Dream of Dream background is the best DDR background ever.

239
00:24:41,197 --> 00:24:41,557
[SPEAKER_07]: But the...

240
00:24:42,538 --> 00:24:47,660
[SPEAKER_07]: The Konga feeling video is like this shot of Vivian, and she has her mouth open and her eyes squinty.

241
00:24:47,821 --> 00:24:48,521
[SPEAKER_07]: It looks scary.

242
00:24:48,581 --> 00:24:53,323
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's a throwback to the original 4th Plus video, which was the girl with her mouth open.

243
00:24:53,623 --> 00:24:56,745
[SPEAKER_07]: But the way they got the freeze frame and the video... The videos were ghetto.

244
00:24:56,965 --> 00:24:57,405
[SPEAKER_07]: That's it.

245
00:24:57,665 --> 00:24:58,125
[SPEAKER_07]: They were ghetto.

246
00:24:58,185 --> 00:24:59,266
[SPEAKER_07]: It looks like a cum shot.

247
00:25:00,806 --> 00:25:03,088
[SPEAKER_07]: Like Konga feeling, because Vivian's got her mouth open.

248
00:25:03,108 --> 00:25:04,148
[SPEAKER_07]: She's like, oh yeah, baby!

249
00:25:04,168 --> 00:25:06,929
[SPEAKER_07]: What about Captain Jack's background for Dream or Dream?

250
00:25:06,949 --> 00:25:07,910
[SPEAKER_07]: Dream or Dream was awesome.

251
00:25:08,190 --> 00:25:10,491
[SPEAKER_07]: He's just like... He's like, scary monster man.

252
00:25:12,822 --> 00:25:13,823
[SPEAKER_07]: Shittiest background.

253
00:25:14,704 --> 00:25:15,825
[SPEAKER_07]: Shittiest new background.

254
00:25:19,128 --> 00:25:20,389
[SPEAKER_07]: The love at first sight video is scary.

255
00:25:20,409 --> 00:25:21,911
[SPEAKER_08]: You should watch the whole thing.

256
00:25:23,072 --> 00:25:25,074
[SPEAKER_07]: I would say... I don't want to watch the whole thing.

257
00:25:25,114 --> 00:25:27,036
[SPEAKER_07]: Shittiest background is days go by.

258
00:25:27,196 --> 00:25:27,657
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry.

259
00:25:27,757 --> 00:25:32,461
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't... Because that shot of the guys in the car, they like keep showing that in the video.

260
00:25:32,501 --> 00:25:34,143
[SPEAKER_08]: They're actually... It's because they're the singers.

261
00:25:35,263 --> 00:25:43,225
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, well, I... You can't really see it much because the videos are so low-res, but they're actually singing the song in the background.

262
00:25:44,186 --> 00:25:44,366
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh.

263
00:25:45,046 --> 00:25:45,686
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, it sucks.

264
00:25:45,706 --> 00:25:46,666
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't like the Dream Dream background.

265
00:25:46,686 --> 00:25:51,588
[SPEAKER_15]: That's a video, though, that I need to get the whole thing of, though, because... Yeah, that's the worst video.

266
00:25:52,268 --> 00:25:52,588
[SPEAKER_15]: But, no...

267
00:25:53,508 --> 00:25:59,472
[SPEAKER_15]: But no, for Days Go By, the whole video, I really want to see it because it's supposed to actually have a whole story to it.

268
00:25:59,492 --> 00:26:07,116
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah, it has subtitles too, which somehow, I think they totally edited the Max 2 USA one because it has no subtitles.

269
00:26:07,377 --> 00:26:09,658
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think they totally picked and chose different clips.

270
00:26:09,878 --> 00:26:12,520
[SPEAKER_07]: Because if you notice, if you watch the Kylie video, they had to edit that too.

271
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:14,621
[SPEAKER_07]: Because they had to edit it to go with the edited song.

272
00:26:14,641 --> 00:26:19,104
[SPEAKER_08]: I think this is also turned into widescreen on the...

273
00:26:20,665 --> 00:26:22,205
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't pay that close attention, unfortunately.

274
00:26:22,225 --> 00:26:27,769
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought they changed the ratio so that it wouldn't show where the actual subtitles would have been.

275
00:26:28,649 --> 00:26:29,009
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe.

276
00:26:29,029 --> 00:26:29,950
[SPEAKER_07]: They may have done something like that.

277
00:26:30,830 --> 00:26:35,693
[SPEAKER_07]: If you want to comment on Max 2 USA with the rest of our listeners, www.callybomani.com.

278
00:26:35,713 --> 00:26:37,474
[SPEAKER_07]: Click on Orange Lounge and click on Chat.

279
00:26:37,754 --> 00:26:40,076
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll be playing Max 2 USA MP3s throughout the evening.

280
00:26:40,136 --> 00:26:43,378
[SPEAKER_07]: We also have the three brand new songs in DDR.

281
00:26:43,718 --> 00:26:44,498
[SPEAKER_07]: That's my next question.

282
00:26:44,518 --> 00:26:46,339
[SPEAKER_07]: What did you guys think of the brand, brand new songs?

283
00:26:46,359 --> 00:26:47,240
[SPEAKER_07]: They've never been in DDR before.

284
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:51,603
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry, the Konami originals that have not been in any game yet.

285
00:26:51,943 --> 00:26:53,625
[SPEAKER_07]: Like Forever Sunshine and all that stuff.

286
00:26:54,225 --> 00:26:54,545
[SPEAKER_15]: Fun.

287
00:26:56,146 --> 00:26:58,468
[SPEAKER_07]: Forever Sunshine came out of my ass.

288
00:26:58,488 --> 00:27:00,610
[SPEAKER_07]: Like a liquidly brown goo.

289
00:27:01,150 --> 00:27:02,211
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what that song was.

290
00:27:02,431 --> 00:27:05,113
[SPEAKER_07]: We found a singer that sings worse than Paul Eteri.

291
00:27:06,074 --> 00:27:07,535
[SPEAKER_07]: We didn't think it was possible?

292
00:27:09,517 --> 00:27:11,397
[SPEAKER_07]: I gotta tell you, Try to Love You, I actually like that song.

293
00:27:11,417 --> 00:27:15,418
[SPEAKER_07]: Try to Love You has the chick from Let Them Move singing, and it's actually a really damn good song.

294
00:27:15,478 --> 00:27:15,919
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it is.

295
00:27:16,339 --> 00:27:17,419
[SPEAKER_07]: It's Forever Sunshine.

296
00:27:17,439 --> 00:27:20,240
[SPEAKER_07]: The first time I heard it, it was like, eh, but it started to grow on me.

297
00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:22,760
[SPEAKER_07]: Forever Sunshine is awful.

298
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:26,621
[SPEAKER_07]: It has Miss Piggy singing it, is what we were saying on Wednesday.

299
00:27:27,361 --> 00:27:30,182
[SPEAKER_22]: Ernie, Forever Sunshine, come here.

300
00:27:31,977 --> 00:27:32,578
[SPEAKER_08]: That's sad.

301
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:41,805
[SPEAKER_08]: I wish they would have taken that one new song from Lesson Mode and actually put that into the game.

302
00:27:41,825 --> 00:27:45,569
[SPEAKER_07]: The biggest letdown is not having that song in the game as a playable song.

303
00:27:45,909 --> 00:27:47,130
[SPEAKER_07]: That's one we didn't rip.

304
00:27:48,331 --> 00:27:49,292
[SPEAKER_07]: That's one thing we've got to do.

305
00:27:49,312 --> 00:27:51,394
[SPEAKER_07]: I have an MP3 of it, too.

306
00:27:53,055 --> 00:27:57,459
[SPEAKER_08]: I actually just played through that whole section of Lesson Mode just so I could play that song in its entirety.

307
00:27:57,939 --> 00:28:01,502
[SPEAKER_07]: You know one thing that also impressed me about Max 2 USA I've got to say?

308
00:28:01,522 --> 00:28:02,783
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you watch the credit sequence?

309
00:28:04,144 --> 00:28:04,405
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

310
00:28:04,925 --> 00:28:10,210
[SPEAKER_07]: The credit sequence is actually really cool because it goes through all the stock videos and just plays them.

311
00:28:10,370 --> 00:28:11,691
[SPEAKER_07]: It's pretty cool.

312
00:28:12,331 --> 00:28:12,632
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

313
00:28:14,253 --> 00:28:15,734
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, dangers with the video?

314
00:28:16,775 --> 00:28:18,637
[SPEAKER_07]: They don't show videos or characters at the same time.

315
00:28:19,592 --> 00:28:22,814
[SPEAKER_15]: When they do the three... I'm sorry, I'm talking about the busy videos.

316
00:28:23,155 --> 00:28:26,477
[SPEAKER_15]: When you have three dancers and then all the busy stuff.

317
00:28:26,997 --> 00:28:29,118
[SPEAKER_15]: And they all do their own dance, so it's really stupid looking.

318
00:28:29,859 --> 00:28:30,619
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what?

319
00:28:30,639 --> 00:28:32,341
[SPEAKER_07]: Sometimes they'll do the same dance.

320
00:28:32,361 --> 00:28:34,182
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you like the dancers overall, Jamie?

321
00:28:34,302 --> 00:28:35,222
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you think it was a good feature?

322
00:28:37,224 --> 00:28:39,065
[SPEAKER_15]: I liked that they were all cleaned up and cel-shaded.

323
00:28:39,085 --> 00:28:39,665
[SPEAKER_15]: They were really nice.

324
00:28:40,126 --> 00:28:41,246
[SPEAKER_07]: The characters looked gorgeous.

325
00:28:41,266 --> 00:28:43,128
[SPEAKER_07]: Cel-shaded rage is fucking pimp.

326
00:28:43,888 --> 00:28:46,310
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you think they totally stole that idea from Step Mania, though?

327
00:28:47,674 --> 00:28:50,355
[SPEAKER_07]: They could have, but somebody is insatiated.

328
00:28:50,395 --> 00:28:53,176
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what, they did it better in the USDDR, I gotta say.

329
00:28:53,216 --> 00:28:57,497
[SPEAKER_07]: But I'll tell you what, the best thing about those characters is when you get extra stage playing Max Unlimited.

330
00:28:57,537 --> 00:28:59,198
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh my god, they're seizuring!

331
00:28:59,318 --> 00:29:00,018
[SPEAKER_07]: It's funny.

332
00:29:00,618 --> 00:29:02,739
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like, hello, seizures.

333
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:04,820
[SPEAKER_07]: It's crazy.

334
00:29:06,501 --> 00:29:10,623
[SPEAKER_07]: 23rd Magus says in the chat room, the best song in the game was the Midnight Blaze remix in the menus.

335
00:29:11,424 --> 00:29:12,304
[SPEAKER_07]: That was an awesome mix.

336
00:29:12,344 --> 00:29:14,345
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, kind of a disappointment that that wasn't in there.

337
00:29:14,385 --> 00:29:15,486
[SPEAKER_07]: Was that the same one from VRare?

338
00:29:15,886 --> 00:29:16,327
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it is.

339
00:29:16,387 --> 00:29:17,027
[SPEAKER_07]: I hate System SF.

340
00:29:19,309 --> 00:29:21,190
[SPEAKER_07]: I know you hate System SF, but you'll get into it later.

341
00:29:21,210 --> 00:29:22,951
[SPEAKER_07]: I like that new Kind Lady remix.

342
00:29:22,991 --> 00:29:27,153
[SPEAKER_07]: It was actually kind of hard, and it was fun, and I liked it.

343
00:29:27,654 --> 00:29:28,854
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to have that next week.

344
00:29:28,954 --> 00:29:31,396
[SPEAKER_07]: Next week we're going to have the US VRare 2.

345
00:29:31,536 --> 00:29:34,558
[SPEAKER_07]: Jamie has it, and she's going to bring it next week for us.

346
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:40,802
[SPEAKER_07]: After the show tonight, by the way, Night Style, original soundtrack, we're going to play it for you guys.

347
00:29:40,822 --> 00:29:45,663
[SPEAKER_07]: Because we've been playing bits and pieces for you guys throughout the week, but I know most of you guys listen to the Tonight Show.

348
00:29:46,564 --> 00:29:50,685
[SPEAKER_08]: Didn't it go up on MGG, the first disc of Night Style?

349
00:29:50,705 --> 00:29:51,665
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know, we had the whole thing.

350
00:29:51,825 --> 00:29:53,146
[SPEAKER_07]: We got it through a different source.

351
00:29:54,867 --> 00:29:57,367
[SPEAKER_07]: One of our studio regulars got it for us.

352
00:29:58,328 --> 00:29:59,048
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

353
00:30:00,268 --> 00:30:01,229
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll need to get a copy then.

354
00:30:02,409 --> 00:30:04,190
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't copy tonight, but I can get it for you during the week.

355
00:30:04,230 --> 00:30:04,470
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway...

356
00:30:05,535 --> 00:30:06,656
[SPEAKER_07]: Anybody else want a microphone now?

357
00:30:06,676 --> 00:30:08,677
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, who wants... Anyone else want to comment on Max 2?

358
00:30:08,757 --> 00:30:09,098
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki?

359
00:30:10,138 --> 00:30:10,519
[SPEAKER_07]: Bradley?

360
00:30:10,579 --> 00:30:11,379
[SPEAKER_07]: I know you haven't played it.

361
00:30:11,419 --> 00:30:12,760
[SPEAKER_07]: Bradley, you have anything you want to say on Max 2?

362
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:15,602
[SPEAKER_07]: I know you got a little bit out on Wednesday, but... Jamie!

363
00:30:15,622 --> 00:30:17,023
[SPEAKER_07]: What do you have to say about Max 2?

364
00:30:17,063 --> 00:30:18,044
[SPEAKER_07]: She's cooking.

365
00:30:18,064 --> 00:30:18,584
[SPEAKER_07]: She's cooking.

366
00:30:19,425 --> 00:30:20,946
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm, like, stuck with the microphone?

367
00:30:20,966 --> 00:30:21,787
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

368
00:30:21,827 --> 00:30:23,468
[SPEAKER_07]: What else is there to talk about with Max 2?

369
00:30:24,408 --> 00:30:28,852
[SPEAKER_07]: There's something, um... The non... I'm actually glad they took out OEs and replaced them with non-stops.

370
00:30:29,352 --> 00:30:30,613
[SPEAKER_07]: Because non-stops are much better.

371
00:30:31,053 --> 00:30:32,974
[SPEAKER_07]: Jason Enos is brilliant.

372
00:30:33,014 --> 00:30:33,774
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, thank you.

373
00:30:33,994 --> 00:30:34,534
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

374
00:30:34,714 --> 00:30:35,574
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what I forgot.

375
00:30:35,834 --> 00:30:39,775
[SPEAKER_07]: The information screen is like the best part of the unlocks.

376
00:30:40,035 --> 00:30:40,635
[SPEAKER_07]: Completely.

377
00:30:40,775 --> 00:30:42,916
[SPEAKER_07]: It is so hilarious.

378
00:30:43,876 --> 00:30:46,737
[SPEAKER_07]: And supposedly, the rumor is Jason Enos wrote all those himself.

379
00:30:47,097 --> 00:30:50,198
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, we know he did for Max, and so we kind of assume he did for Max, too.

380
00:30:51,078 --> 00:30:51,458
[SPEAKER_07]: Who knows?

381
00:30:51,558 --> 00:30:55,599
[SPEAKER_07]: But those things were the funniest damn things.

382
00:30:55,619 --> 00:30:56,099
[SPEAKER_15]: You know what?

383
00:30:56,159 --> 00:30:58,120
[SPEAKER_15]: And there's one for every damn song in the game.

384
00:30:58,160 --> 00:30:59,180
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, and they're funny.

385
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:05,827
[SPEAKER_07]: Some of them are kind of generic, but some of the ones that use the worst puns ever are so great.

386
00:31:07,749 --> 00:31:13,496
[SPEAKER_07]: Honestly, that was part of the unlocking for me, was just getting to do the bad puns.

387
00:31:15,098 --> 00:31:15,398
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, Jamie?

388
00:31:15,418 --> 00:31:15,518
[SPEAKER_07]: Jamie?

389
00:31:17,103 --> 00:31:22,691
[SPEAKER_15]: I didn't get a chance to check it out because I've been kind of busy, but I'm going to be using the workout mode in the game.

390
00:31:23,432 --> 00:31:25,174
[SPEAKER_15]: And it looks like it was tweaked a little bit.

391
00:31:25,214 --> 00:31:26,876
[SPEAKER_07]: Have you looked at workout mode?

392
00:31:26,956 --> 00:31:27,757
[SPEAKER_07]: They did change it.

393
00:31:28,158 --> 00:31:29,880
[SPEAKER_07]: I was not able to find non-stops though.

394
00:31:30,281 --> 00:31:32,664
[SPEAKER_07]: I heard a rumor that non-stops were in workout mode.

395
00:31:33,505 --> 00:31:34,166
[SPEAKER_07]: We couldn't find them.

396
00:31:37,444 --> 00:31:38,745
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, maybe that's what we did wrong.

397
00:31:40,105 --> 00:31:42,085
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I'll tell you what though, they totally changed the interface.

398
00:31:42,505 --> 00:31:45,966
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, the interface in workout mode looks better than in the in-game.

399
00:31:46,006 --> 00:31:48,267
[SPEAKER_07]: It has like the stars and the flashing red background.

400
00:31:48,747 --> 00:31:49,527
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's pretty.

401
00:31:50,407 --> 00:31:51,448
[SPEAKER_07]: It's very pretty.

402
00:31:53,048 --> 00:31:53,888
[SPEAKER_08]: No, it's pretty.

403
00:31:53,948 --> 00:31:57,189
[SPEAKER_08]: It's got the little spiral swirly thing and it makes it look cool.

404
00:31:57,793 --> 00:32:04,014
[SPEAKER_07]: I kind of like how Max 2 USA feels a little bit like a hybrid of Max 2 and Xtreme, like with all the Xtreme videos being in there and stuff.

405
00:32:04,694 --> 00:32:13,936
[SPEAKER_07]: But what's interesting is that when October 9th, we're only like two weeks away from it, we're going to be seeing the Japanese version of Xtreme, and we here at Orange Lounge Radio, of course, will be getting that.

406
00:32:13,976 --> 00:32:15,617
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to do another launch party.

407
00:32:15,637 --> 00:32:16,957
[SPEAKER_07]: Another big promo for that one.

408
00:32:17,197 --> 00:32:20,678
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, but the problem is, we don't know what day we're going to get it.

409
00:32:20,698 --> 00:32:23,018
[SPEAKER_08]: You may not get it for like three weeks after it's released.

410
00:32:23,038 --> 00:32:25,779
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, we're hoping we're going to get it within days of its release.

411
00:32:25,839 --> 00:32:26,219
[SPEAKER_07]: It could be...

412
00:32:29,002 --> 00:32:29,883
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll get that later.

413
00:32:44,884 --> 00:32:49,689
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, Loki will get into that later, why War is on a hiatus for a little while.

414
00:32:51,271 --> 00:33:01,020
[SPEAKER_07]: DDR Extreme Japan, it's kind of like, wow, it's going to be interesting because Max 2 USA, for once, it's like it's taken a lot of the good things before the Japanese can do it.

415
00:33:01,841 --> 00:33:04,142
[SPEAKER_31]: Yeah, we actually beat them to things.

416
00:33:04,422 --> 00:33:06,803
[SPEAKER_07]: The cell shading characters, some of the songs.

417
00:33:06,823 --> 00:33:08,044
[SPEAKER_07]: Background movies.

418
00:33:08,544 --> 00:33:09,264
[SPEAKER_07]: Background movies.

419
00:33:09,805 --> 00:33:12,186
[SPEAKER_07]: Although if you heard this, this is kind of news that came out this week.

420
00:33:13,106 --> 00:33:16,368
[SPEAKER_07]: DDR Party Edition, the one that's going to come out after Extreme.

421
00:33:16,568 --> 00:33:18,689
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if it's the end of the year or first quarter next year.

422
00:33:19,409 --> 00:33:21,892
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's kind of going to be a Best Hits 2, basically.

423
00:33:22,332 --> 00:33:23,934
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's going to use music videos.

424
00:33:24,714 --> 00:33:25,595
[SPEAKER_07]: That could be interesting.

425
00:33:25,635 --> 00:33:29,499
[SPEAKER_07]: It's been confirmed that Conga Feelin's going to have its videos, so who knows what other videos we're going to get now.

426
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:32,162
[SPEAKER_07]: Probably the same four we have in Max 2 USA.

427
00:33:32,242 --> 00:33:33,864
[SPEAKER_07]: Could we get Butterfly's video?

428
00:33:33,884 --> 00:33:35,705
[SPEAKER_07]: Because Butterfly has been confirmed in the mix.

429
00:33:35,785 --> 00:33:35,906
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

430
00:33:35,926 --> 00:33:36,606
[SPEAKER_07]: That could be interesting.

431
00:33:37,027 --> 00:33:37,247
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

432
00:33:37,647 --> 00:33:38,128
[SPEAKER_08]: Just no.

433
00:33:39,109 --> 00:33:40,070
[SPEAKER_08]: That's frightening.

434
00:33:41,771 --> 00:33:42,792
[SPEAKER_08]: And whose phone is ringing?

435
00:33:42,832 --> 00:33:43,313
[SPEAKER_08]: It's going off it.

436
00:33:45,177 --> 00:33:48,058
[SPEAKER_07]: I hear a tone.

437
00:33:48,658 --> 00:33:52,439
[SPEAKER_07]: Bad song in that mix.

438
00:33:53,639 --> 00:33:55,980
[SPEAKER_07]: Spice Girls' Wannabe is going to be in DDR Party.

439
00:33:56,140 --> 00:33:56,940
[SPEAKER_05]: You're kidding.

440
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:58,461
[SPEAKER_07]: It has like two new songs.

441
00:33:58,481 --> 00:33:59,021
[SPEAKER_07]: You're kidding.

442
00:33:59,061 --> 00:34:01,261
[SPEAKER_07]: One of them is a beat for you song and the other one is Spice Girls.

443
00:34:01,281 --> 00:34:01,441
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

444
00:34:02,362 --> 00:34:04,262
[SPEAKER_07]: Because it's in the new Euro.

445
00:34:04,282 --> 00:34:05,082
[SPEAKER_07]: No, no, no, no, no, no.

446
00:34:05,102 --> 00:34:05,942
[SPEAKER_07]: It's in the new Euro game.

447
00:34:06,383 --> 00:34:08,283
[SPEAKER_08]: Fuck the Spice Girls.

448
00:34:09,103 --> 00:34:09,924
[SPEAKER_08]: Fuck them.

449
00:34:10,464 --> 00:34:11,464
[SPEAKER_08]: Fuck their music.

450
00:34:15,191 --> 00:34:18,232
[SPEAKER_08]: Why do they have to prolong their song's life?

451
00:34:18,512 --> 00:34:24,255
[SPEAKER_07]: And of course, people are spreading rumors that the Korean songs will finally make their debut in Party.

452
00:34:24,376 --> 00:34:25,536
[SPEAKER_07]: I doubt it too.

453
00:34:25,636 --> 00:34:26,637
[SPEAKER_07]: Never gonna happen.

454
00:34:26,677 --> 00:34:32,080
[SPEAKER_07]: Stop wanting those old pieces of shit songs.

455
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:35,381
[SPEAKER_07]: If they were so good, they would have brought them back.

456
00:34:35,662 --> 00:34:36,502
[SPEAKER_07]: But they suck.

457
00:34:36,562 --> 00:34:37,022
[SPEAKER_07]: Get over it.

458
00:34:42,546 --> 00:34:49,213
[SPEAKER_07]: FaceSucks, I will give you that, but Bakuo and... What's the one, wherever you go, what's the slow one?

459
00:34:49,773 --> 00:34:55,879
[SPEAKER_07]: Buell, Buell, BuellSucks, but like Wah, Bakua, SongSuck, MaskTime.

460
00:34:58,862 --> 00:35:02,406
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, one of the Sacramento regulars had a routine to be old, it was pretty cool.

461
00:35:05,049 --> 00:35:05,329
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway...

462
00:35:08,390 --> 00:35:11,651
[SPEAKER_07]: In the chatroom, Holly is posting parody lyrics to Wannabe.

463
00:35:12,131 --> 00:35:14,632
[SPEAKER_07]: If you want to be my butter, you got to spread on my bread.

464
00:35:14,912 --> 00:35:15,512
[SPEAKER_07]: That's cute.

465
00:35:15,652 --> 00:35:16,533
[SPEAKER_07]: That's very cute.

466
00:35:17,793 --> 00:35:21,374
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, Tell Me Tell Me had like the funnest trick double steps ever.

467
00:35:22,955 --> 00:35:23,915
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't do trick doubles.

468
00:35:23,975 --> 00:35:24,675
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Starion.

469
00:35:24,695 --> 00:35:27,776
[SPEAKER_07]: No, Bakua had the worst double steps.

470
00:35:27,796 --> 00:35:28,856
[SPEAKER_07]: Bakua had horrible double steps.

471
00:35:28,996 --> 00:35:33,678
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, it would be nice if those show up on Party Edition, but I'm not going to hold my breath over it.

472
00:35:33,958 --> 00:35:34,638
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it would be nice.

473
00:35:35,098 --> 00:35:36,359
[SPEAKER_32]: Maybe Petit Love will come back.

474
00:35:36,399 --> 00:35:36,859
[SPEAKER_32]: Oh, my God.

475
00:35:38,461 --> 00:35:41,942
[SPEAKER_07]: If that happened, I would break the game.

476
00:35:41,962 --> 00:35:46,144
[SPEAKER_07]: If Butterfly is on it, okay, then SmileDK is coming back to a home release.

477
00:35:46,584 --> 00:35:47,804
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's get Petite Love on here.

478
00:35:48,505 --> 00:35:49,805
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I don't think it'll happen.

479
00:35:52,146 --> 00:35:54,547
[SPEAKER_07]: We need bass solo songs.

480
00:35:55,727 --> 00:35:59,369
[SPEAKER_07]: So, Extreme will be out in a few weeks, and there's a couple new tracks in Extreme.

481
00:35:59,849 --> 00:36:00,289
[SPEAKER_07]: It'll be fun.

482
00:36:01,411 --> 00:36:06,596
[SPEAKER_07]: A Stupid Barber A Stupid Barber has been confirmed What the hell is that song?

483
00:36:06,736 --> 00:36:15,283
[SPEAKER_07]: It's by Soda It's by the same one who did one of the songs Is it Do It Right?

484
00:36:15,763 --> 00:36:20,167
[SPEAKER_07]: It's also one of the songs in Max 2 USA What?

485
00:36:20,187 --> 00:36:20,267
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

486
00:36:22,858 --> 00:36:23,779
[SPEAKER_07]: Show T?

487
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:25,240
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

488
00:36:25,540 --> 00:36:27,562
[SPEAKER_07]: It's one of the Hidden Max 2 USA songs, too.

489
00:36:27,582 --> 00:36:28,402
[SPEAKER_07]: I just can't think of the name.

490
00:36:28,422 --> 00:36:29,343
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm looking it up right now.

491
00:36:29,663 --> 00:36:30,203
[SPEAKER_07]: I Need You.

492
00:36:30,564 --> 00:36:30,964
[SPEAKER_07]: That one.

493
00:36:31,224 --> 00:36:32,305
[SPEAKER_07]: I Need You was by him, too.

494
00:36:32,325 --> 00:36:35,287
[SPEAKER_07]: With the piano in the background?

495
00:36:36,768 --> 00:36:36,868
[SPEAKER_31]: Oh.

496
00:36:38,883 --> 00:36:39,544
[SPEAKER_31]: Oh, that one.

497
00:36:40,425 --> 00:36:41,006
[SPEAKER_31]: Right, whatever.

498
00:36:42,628 --> 00:36:46,773
[SPEAKER_07]: So, um... Okay, so what's this you're going to play for us, Loki?

499
00:36:47,594 --> 00:36:51,939
[SPEAKER_07]: This is the track that was in the lesson mode in X2.

500
00:36:51,999 --> 00:36:53,741
[SPEAKER_08]: I think... I heard it be called Overloaded.

501
00:36:53,801 --> 00:36:54,522
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, let's hear it.

502
00:38:37,752 --> 00:38:42,296
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, that is Lesson 2, we're calling it for now.

503
00:38:42,917 --> 00:38:45,099
[SPEAKER_07]: It might be overloaded because that's the one lyric in it.

504
00:38:45,439 --> 00:38:48,262
[SPEAKER_07]: But that is Lesson 2 in Max 2 USA.

505
00:38:48,302 --> 00:38:49,803
[SPEAKER_07]: And it fucking rules.

506
00:38:50,744 --> 00:38:51,365
[SPEAKER_07]: It's awesome.

507
00:38:51,585 --> 00:38:53,407
[SPEAKER_07]: And what if that's a stupid barber?

508
00:38:55,168 --> 00:38:56,710
[SPEAKER_07]: That would be, no, just no.

509
00:38:57,030 --> 00:38:58,071
[SPEAKER_07]: I doubt it, but that would be cool.

510
00:39:00,151 --> 00:39:01,231
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, here's the other thing, though.

511
00:39:01,392 --> 00:39:02,932
[SPEAKER_07]: It's one of the things we can look at.

512
00:39:03,653 --> 00:39:14,217
[SPEAKER_07]: Since, pretty much, you can guarantee Extreme, the Party Mix, Max 2 USA, and Dancing Stage Fever are... Whatever their one is going to be called now.

513
00:39:14,237 --> 00:39:16,578
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if it's Fever or not, but anyways.

514
00:39:16,738 --> 00:39:20,760
[SPEAKER_07]: They're all sharing the same song list that was in Max 2.

515
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:27,763
[SPEAKER_07]: So you pretty much eliminate all the songs that have been confirmed for the other games, and you're left with what's in Extreme, which one of them is Max, period.

516
00:39:29,104 --> 00:39:29,945
[SPEAKER_08]: Another Max?

517
00:39:30,265 --> 00:39:30,866
[SPEAKER_07]: Max period.

518
00:39:31,046 --> 00:39:45,018
[SPEAKER_07]: The problem is if that appears in DDR Extreme, it's going to be pretty much guaranteed that that's going to be DDR Extreme was the last arcade version because they never release Maxes on the home versions at all.

519
00:39:45,199 --> 00:39:46,520
[SPEAKER_07]: So that would be my guess.

520
00:39:49,763 --> 00:39:54,325
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to go out on a limb here, and I know Loki's going to yell at me for it, but I think Max Period is a red herring.

521
00:39:54,345 --> 00:39:55,165
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think it means anything.

522
00:39:55,726 --> 00:39:57,667
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it'll be nothing.

523
00:39:57,847 --> 00:39:59,307
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think it's going to be a song.

524
00:39:59,827 --> 00:40:01,648
[SPEAKER_07]: But I would love to be proven wrong.

525
00:40:04,870 --> 00:40:05,550
[SPEAKER_15]: Mine didn't break.

526
00:40:07,131 --> 00:40:08,751
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't even remember when it broke.

527
00:40:09,191 --> 00:40:10,932
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe that song was Max Period.

528
00:40:10,972 --> 00:40:11,593
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh my gods.

529
00:40:12,613 --> 00:40:16,034
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to move your jacket right here.

530
00:40:19,244 --> 00:40:20,665
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, we're going to take a break.

531
00:40:20,685 --> 00:40:22,387
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to play some more Max 2 USA stuff.

532
00:40:22,407 --> 00:40:26,591
[SPEAKER_07]: When we come back, we're going to finish up any talk on Max 2 USA.

533
00:40:26,611 --> 00:40:31,115
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to talk a bit about some other games and some other arcades in town.

534
00:40:31,135 --> 00:40:33,617
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to talk about 2DX as well when we come back.

535
00:40:34,057 --> 00:40:39,242
[SPEAKER_07]: After this group of Max 2 USA MP3s, we're going to hear in this break, start off with Days Go By.

536
00:40:39,282 --> 00:40:41,304
[SPEAKER_07]: And you're going to hear Forever Sunshine in this break too.

537
00:40:41,324 --> 00:40:41,364
[SPEAKER_07]: No!

538
00:40:42,046 --> 00:40:43,286
[SPEAKER_07]: No, God no.

539
00:40:43,747 --> 00:40:49,129
[SPEAKER_07]: It's only a minute and 28 seconds, but I feel an obligation to our listeners who haven't been able to hear it yet.

540
00:40:49,809 --> 00:40:51,249
[SPEAKER_07]: They can say they've heard it, so here it is.

541
00:40:51,569 --> 00:40:53,390
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you really want to scare the crap out of them?

542
00:40:53,430 --> 00:40:56,711
[SPEAKER_07]: That's okay, because after that we get one of the coolest 70 songs ever, Get Down Tonight.

543
00:40:58,032 --> 00:40:58,952
[SPEAKER_07]: Do a little dance.

544
00:40:59,132 --> 00:40:59,692
[SPEAKER_15]: You know what?

545
00:41:00,493 --> 00:41:00,953
[SPEAKER_15]: You know what?

546
00:41:01,033 --> 00:41:07,235
[SPEAKER_15]: People don't need to buy laxatives anymore, because all they have to do is listen to that Sunshine song, and it'll make them poop.

547
00:41:08,958 --> 00:41:11,161
[SPEAKER_22]: and Forever Sunshine.

548
00:41:12,502 --> 00:41:13,463
[SPEAKER_22]: I love you.

549
00:41:13,704 --> 00:41:14,364
[SPEAKER_22]: Listen, Frog.

550
00:41:15,205 --> 00:41:17,307
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, is that song worse than Let Them Move?

551
00:41:18,829 --> 00:41:20,190
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that song worse than Let Them Move?

552
00:41:20,651 --> 00:41:21,432
[SPEAKER_07]: We will find out.

553
00:41:21,512 --> 00:41:23,074
[SPEAKER_07]: We will find out after the break.

554
00:41:24,115 --> 00:41:25,156
[SPEAKER_15]: We should make the chatroom vote.

555
00:42:26,095 --> 00:42:29,168
[SPEAKER_22]: Days when I couldn't live my life without you

556
00:45:53,850 --> 00:45:56,879
[SPEAKER_05]: Orange Lounge Radio With the Ping Pong Boys

557
00:46:02,375 --> 00:46:07,876
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, welcome back, boys and girls, to Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 62, playing Max 2 USA MP3s all night tonight.

558
00:46:07,936 --> 00:46:17,079
[SPEAKER_07]: In that break, you heard Dirty Vegas, Days Go By, Shell Y with Forever Sunshine, and Miss Piggy, and KC and the Sunshine Band with Get Down Tonight.

559
00:46:17,279 --> 00:46:19,219
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, I have to make a comment on the chat room.

560
00:46:19,299 --> 00:46:19,539
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

561
00:46:19,579 --> 00:46:25,801
[SPEAKER_08]: For your response to Biohazard, don't diss fucking KC and the Sunshine Band.

562
00:46:25,841 --> 00:46:29,862
[SPEAKER_08]: You are... That is the best fucking song ever.

563
00:46:32,312 --> 00:46:33,752
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what, though?

564
00:46:34,533 --> 00:46:36,694
[SPEAKER_07]: I do have to agree with half of what he says.

565
00:46:36,734 --> 00:46:40,475
[SPEAKER_07]: I think Let's Groove is funner to dance to, and funner is a word, yes.

566
00:46:40,956 --> 00:46:41,636
[SPEAKER_07]: Gotcha, though?

567
00:46:41,816 --> 00:46:42,436
[SPEAKER_07]: Can't stand it.

568
00:46:42,636 --> 00:46:43,857
[SPEAKER_06]: Can't stand Gotcha.

569
00:46:45,478 --> 00:46:48,319
[SPEAKER_07]: I cannot stand dancing to that song.

570
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:51,941
[SPEAKER_07]: Before we went to the break, we said we were going to settle a debate.

571
00:46:51,961 --> 00:46:52,661
[SPEAKER_07]: Which song is worse?

572
00:46:56,556 --> 00:46:58,357
[SPEAKER_07]: Forever Sunshine, or Let Them Move?

573
00:46:58,877 --> 00:47:04,198
[SPEAKER_07]: The chat room has voted, and I will reveal what they have voted, which one is worse, but I just want to hear what you guys think, and why.

574
00:47:05,278 --> 00:47:06,499
[SPEAKER_07]: Aaron, we haven't heard much from you tonight.

575
00:47:06,539 --> 00:47:08,959
[SPEAKER_07]: Which song's worse, Let Them Move or Forever Sunshine?

576
00:47:09,820 --> 00:47:11,440
[SPEAKER_10]: I guess you guys should know my opinion on this.

577
00:47:11,660 --> 00:47:12,520
[SPEAKER_10]: I did freestyle.

578
00:47:16,209 --> 00:47:18,691
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I did freestyle to let them move.

579
00:47:20,231 --> 00:47:21,472
[SPEAKER_10]: And we all know how that turned out.

580
00:47:22,533 --> 00:47:25,855
[SPEAKER_10]: But I guess I could say Forever Sunshine is kind of weird.

581
00:47:26,936 --> 00:47:27,616
[SPEAKER_07]: But is it worse?

582
00:47:29,037 --> 00:47:29,597
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, okay.

583
00:47:29,697 --> 00:47:31,999
[SPEAKER_07]: So Aaron says Forever Sunshine is a little worse.

584
00:47:32,759 --> 00:47:33,600
[SPEAKER_10]: Just a little, though.

585
00:47:33,800 --> 00:47:35,842
[SPEAKER_07]: Better close.

586
00:47:36,302 --> 00:47:38,284
[SPEAKER_07]: Puppy, which one's worse and why?

587
00:47:39,365 --> 00:47:43,408
[SPEAKER_08]: Fred or Sunshine, just because it's... I can stand Let Them Move.

588
00:47:44,509 --> 00:47:48,973
[SPEAKER_08]: If I turn the volume down a little bit, but... No, this song is just... Ew.

589
00:47:50,854 --> 00:47:52,676
[SPEAKER_07]: Jamie, which is worse and why?

590
00:47:53,396 --> 00:47:56,879
[SPEAKER_15]: After dealing with Let Them Move for three and a half, nearly four years?

591
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:58,320
[SPEAKER_15]: Uh-uh.

592
00:47:58,601 --> 00:47:59,822
[SPEAKER_15]: Let Them Move is still the worst.

593
00:48:00,749 --> 00:48:01,710
[SPEAKER_15]: www.DarkSakura.com

594
00:48:20,706 --> 00:48:22,967
[SPEAKER_07]: Bradley, which song is worse than why?

595
00:48:23,708 --> 00:48:24,608
[SPEAKER_07]: Let Them Move is worse.

596
00:48:25,108 --> 00:48:29,711
[SPEAKER_07]: Because this woman in this song can actually sing alright, even if she sings weird.

597
00:48:30,091 --> 00:48:31,451
[SPEAKER_07]: But in Let Them Move, she just screeches.

598
00:48:31,471 --> 00:48:36,514
[SPEAKER_22]: Which makes it much worse.

599
00:48:38,455 --> 00:48:40,196
[SPEAKER_07]: So, that's it.

600
00:48:40,836 --> 00:48:42,157
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki, which song is worse than why?

601
00:48:42,377 --> 00:48:45,739
[SPEAKER_07]: I think they need to do Let Them Move Ska, which would be pretty cool.

602
00:48:46,879 --> 00:48:48,240
[SPEAKER_08]: Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.

603
00:48:49,076 --> 00:48:52,438
[SPEAKER_07]: Let them move, let them move, sweet, sweet baby.

604
00:48:52,758 --> 00:48:53,779
[SPEAKER_07]: They could totally do it.

605
00:48:53,799 --> 00:48:59,742
[SPEAKER_07]: They could, like, you know, I don't know, get, um, I don't know, get some ska band to do it.

606
00:48:59,802 --> 00:49:08,407
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, there's plenty of... Get Tom, or was it, um, Mr. Brian in the final band?

607
00:49:09,167 --> 00:49:09,948
[SPEAKER_07]: Get him to do that.

608
00:49:10,008 --> 00:49:12,109
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yeah, we should have put Crash in there, too, but that's all right.

609
00:49:12,209 --> 00:49:13,050
[SPEAKER_07]: That wasn't an option.

610
00:49:13,070 --> 00:49:14,070
[SPEAKER_07]: So, what's your answer?

611
00:49:15,391 --> 00:49:15,531
[SPEAKER_07]: Um...

612
00:49:17,924 --> 00:49:19,506
[SPEAKER_07]: I dislike them equally.

613
00:49:20,607 --> 00:49:27,073
[SPEAKER_07]: No, honestly, I hate Forever Sunshine because it's happy, and I don't like happy.

614
00:49:27,854 --> 00:49:37,943
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's happy like Poppy, like, look, the sun is smiling, the clouds are smiling, the little furry animals are smiling, everybody is smiling happy, happy.

615
00:49:39,044 --> 00:49:41,606
[SPEAKER_07]: to Scream Scream Badly.

616
00:49:41,786 --> 00:49:44,788
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I just... All right.

617
00:49:46,610 --> 00:49:54,555
[SPEAKER_07]: Me, personally, as much as... Now, I can impersonate Muppets to both of them because I can do Miss Piggy with Forever Sunshine, but with Let Them Move, I can also do Elmo loves Para Para.

618
00:49:54,615 --> 00:49:55,396
[SPEAKER_23]: Let them move.

619
00:49:55,696 --> 00:49:57,197
[SPEAKER_23]: Let them move.

620
00:49:58,018 --> 00:49:58,798
[SPEAKER_23]: Sweet, sweet.

621
00:49:59,239 --> 00:49:59,459
[SPEAKER_23]: But...

622
00:50:02,543 --> 00:50:04,864
[SPEAKER_07]: Let Them Move is by far worse.

623
00:50:05,084 --> 00:50:08,566
[SPEAKER_07]: I love imitating Miss Piggy more than I do Elmo, so Forever Sunshine is way worse.

624
00:50:09,086 --> 00:50:10,427
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, Let Them Move is way worse.

625
00:50:10,447 --> 00:50:11,228
[SPEAKER_07]: Forever Sunshine is better.

626
00:50:11,828 --> 00:50:15,830
[SPEAKER_07]: I actually somewhat enjoy Forever Sunshine in a campy musical sort of way.

627
00:50:16,951 --> 00:50:18,591
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, so I think it was even.

628
00:50:18,631 --> 00:50:20,893
[SPEAKER_07]: We had Loki, Bradley, and me said Let Them Move.

629
00:50:20,933 --> 00:50:23,454
[SPEAKER_07]: No, because Jamie also said Let Them Move is worse.

630
00:50:23,514 --> 00:50:25,915
[SPEAKER_07]: It was four, and then you two said Forever Sunshine.

631
00:50:25,935 --> 00:50:27,716
[SPEAKER_07]: What do you guys think the chat room said?

632
00:50:28,437 --> 00:50:29,177
[SPEAKER_07]: Let Them Move.

633
00:50:30,043 --> 00:50:36,065
[SPEAKER_07]: By an overwhelming majority, well, mostly overwhelming, the chatroom says Let Them Move is the worst song.

634
00:50:36,105 --> 00:50:37,625
[SPEAKER_07]: So, there you go.

635
00:50:37,645 --> 00:50:38,525
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the way you guys voted.

636
00:50:38,545 --> 00:50:41,606
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think it matters because it's still banned from the station.

637
00:50:42,627 --> 00:50:44,027
[SPEAKER_07]: Let Them Move is banned from the station.

638
00:50:44,127 --> 00:50:45,327
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know about Forever Sunshine, though.

639
00:50:45,347 --> 00:50:46,988
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if I put that in or not today.

640
00:50:47,048 --> 00:50:49,328
[SPEAKER_07]: I put a bunch of new Max 2 USA MP3s in today.

641
00:50:49,368 --> 00:50:50,949
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if Forever Sunshine is one of them or not.

642
00:50:51,669 --> 00:50:53,930
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, ViolentHyperBurpGirl.

643
00:50:53,970 --> 00:50:55,030
[SPEAKER_07]: That was impressive.

644
00:50:55,737 --> 00:50:57,598
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, it was a double.

645
00:50:58,799 --> 00:51:01,560
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's get into 2DX news and speaking of bad songs.

646
00:51:01,801 --> 00:51:05,683
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, the Night Style soundtrack came out like just a week ago, pretty much.

647
00:51:06,263 --> 00:51:09,745
[SPEAKER_07]: And I have to admit something, and this is hard, this is painful.

648
00:51:09,805 --> 00:51:10,926
[SPEAKER_07]: I need to sit down for this.

649
00:51:12,387 --> 00:51:19,711
[SPEAKER_07]: And you know, the last time I sat down to admit something, I was admitting that I like Paula Terry's version of Dive.

650
00:51:19,871 --> 00:51:21,312
[SPEAKER_07]: So you know that this is bad, okay?

651
00:51:21,332 --> 00:51:22,253
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

652
00:51:23,013 --> 00:51:26,676
[SPEAKER_07]: There was a song that I was somewhat surprised to see on the Night Style soundtrack.

653
00:51:26,716 --> 00:51:29,198
[SPEAKER_07]: And I forgot that this song was in Night Style.

654
00:51:29,238 --> 00:51:38,385
[SPEAKER_07]: But when I was listening to this song, I realized that in the context of 2DX, I actually kind of like this song.

655
00:51:38,505 --> 00:51:42,908
[SPEAKER_07]: And that song is... Don't say it!

656
00:51:43,169 --> 00:51:43,869
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't say it!

657
00:51:44,249 --> 00:51:46,091
[SPEAKER_07]: Stop kind of like bag...

658
00:51:48,126 --> 00:51:49,226
[SPEAKER_07]: You fag!

659
00:51:49,246 --> 00:51:50,447
[SPEAKER_32]: I'm sorry!

660
00:51:51,628 --> 00:51:52,748
[SPEAKER_32]: I'm so sorry.

661
00:51:54,049 --> 00:51:55,650
[SPEAKER_32]: But I like bag.

662
00:51:55,670 --> 00:52:00,113
[SPEAKER_32]: I apologize to my mommy.

663
00:52:01,734 --> 00:52:02,875
[SPEAKER_06]: Jamie likes bag too?

664
00:52:03,015 --> 00:52:05,456
[SPEAKER_06]: It'll only be good when it gets remixed by 2MB.

665
00:52:05,697 --> 00:52:07,378
[SPEAKER_06]: Where the hell has 2MB been?

666
00:52:07,938 --> 00:52:08,478
[SPEAKER_06]: Seriously.

667
00:52:08,798 --> 00:52:09,939
[SPEAKER_06]: He's just like, yeah.

668
00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:13,361
[SPEAKER_07]: That personality, der.

669
00:52:13,401 --> 00:52:13,561
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

670
00:52:14,022 --> 00:52:14,242
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

671
00:52:15,209 --> 00:52:16,750
[SPEAKER_07]: Where has 2MB been?

672
00:52:16,790 --> 00:52:20,051
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, seriously, it's just like, after 5th Mix, I quit, you know?

673
00:52:20,071 --> 00:52:29,215
[SPEAKER_07]: We need to get 2MB here to take all those shitty songs that Naoki, the other personality, keeps making and re- No, wait, 2MB is not Naoki.

674
00:52:29,895 --> 00:52:30,436
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought it was.

675
00:52:31,016 --> 00:52:33,477
[SPEAKER_07]: No, it's- it's you and the- Ah, whatever.

676
00:52:33,497 --> 00:52:33,777
[SPEAKER_07]: Ha!

677
00:52:34,457 --> 00:52:35,318
[SPEAKER_07]: You tricked me!

678
00:52:37,665 --> 00:52:38,325
[SPEAKER_07]: How dare I?

679
00:52:38,906 --> 00:52:40,627
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, we need to get him back to, like, fix.

680
00:52:40,827 --> 00:52:42,708
[SPEAKER_07]: I absolutely agree with Brack2000.

681
00:52:43,309 --> 00:52:45,190
[SPEAKER_07]: He says, Bag is bad for DDR.

682
00:52:45,570 --> 00:52:46,971
[SPEAKER_07]: That's why I hated Bag before.

683
00:52:47,031 --> 00:52:48,572
[SPEAKER_07]: It is an acid song to dance to.

684
00:52:48,592 --> 00:52:50,153
[SPEAKER_07]: Bag should have been in Parapara.

685
00:52:50,333 --> 00:52:51,174
[SPEAKER_07]: It was not fun at all.

686
00:52:51,494 --> 00:52:56,037
[SPEAKER_07]: But Bag in 2DX would actually be kind of fun.

687
00:52:56,077 --> 00:52:59,159
[SPEAKER_07]: I haven't played it in 2DX yet, but I think I'd actually enjoy it.

688
00:52:59,239 --> 00:53:02,421
[SPEAKER_07]: So I found that on the Nightstyle OST, I actually enjoy Bag.

689
00:53:05,270 --> 00:53:06,392
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, Loki!

690
00:53:06,873 --> 00:53:09,780
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the truth, and I believe in telling the truth on this show.

691
00:53:10,983 --> 00:53:11,303
[SPEAKER_07]: Whatever.

692
00:53:12,128 --> 00:53:14,050
[SPEAKER_07]: Also on the Nightstyle soundtrack, there's some great stuff.

693
00:53:14,410 --> 00:53:15,871
[SPEAKER_07]: A long version of Golden Horn.

694
00:53:16,272 --> 00:53:16,612
[SPEAKER_07]: Awesome.

695
00:53:17,032 --> 00:53:19,074
[SPEAKER_07]: A long version of The End of My Spiritually.

696
00:53:19,294 --> 00:53:20,195
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's not a typo.

697
00:53:20,235 --> 00:53:21,216
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not spirituality.

698
00:53:21,256 --> 00:53:22,997
[SPEAKER_07]: It's The End of My Spiritually, if you listen to the lyrics.

699
00:53:23,638 --> 00:53:24,118
[SPEAKER_07]: That's great.

700
00:53:24,739 --> 00:53:27,681
[SPEAKER_07]: And yes, I agree in the chat room.

701
00:53:27,701 --> 00:53:31,724
[SPEAKER_07]: It's scrolled off the screen, but Logic Board is awesome.

702
00:53:31,824 --> 00:53:32,405
[SPEAKER_07]: I love that song.

703
00:53:33,426 --> 00:53:38,730
[SPEAKER_10]: And I agree with Jamie when she says, more men with nice asses need to dance to bag and wear a kilt.

704
00:53:39,231 --> 00:53:40,812
[SPEAKER_07]: And would that be a military-style kilt?

705
00:53:41,312 --> 00:53:42,073
[SPEAKER_10]: Full traditional.

706
00:53:44,655 --> 00:53:46,897
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

707
00:53:46,957 --> 00:53:49,239
[SPEAKER_08]: How does Sweetest Savage sound?

708
00:53:49,279 --> 00:53:49,760
[SPEAKER_07]: Pretty nice.

709
00:53:50,040 --> 00:53:50,460
[SPEAKER_07]: Pretty good.

710
00:53:50,941 --> 00:53:53,823
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the other athletics one, right?

711
00:53:54,283 --> 00:53:54,804
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what I thought.

712
00:53:54,844 --> 00:53:55,444
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's pretty good.

713
00:53:56,866 --> 00:54:02,911
[SPEAKER_07]: It's interesting because when you hear things on the Nightstyle OST, it sounds a lot different than those MP3s that were leaked before.

714
00:54:03,752 --> 00:54:05,253
[SPEAKER_15]: Please Don't Go needs to be in DDR.

715
00:54:06,374 --> 00:54:08,675
[SPEAKER_15]: Imagine how fun that would be on the little scratchy parts.

716
00:54:09,475 --> 00:54:14,739
[SPEAKER_07]: See, why can't they take songs from 2DX like Please Don't Go and put those into Max 2 USA?

717
00:54:14,879 --> 00:54:18,521
[SPEAKER_07]: Instead, oh my god, VJ Army would kick so much ass in DDR.

718
00:54:18,781 --> 00:54:23,244
[SPEAKER_07]: Why don't they take those instead and put them in instead of repeating fucking Put Your Faith In Me?

719
00:54:24,372 --> 00:54:29,795
[SPEAKER_07]: And what I don't get is, they're like, you know, in-house music, so why... I mean... I know.

720
00:54:29,915 --> 00:54:33,197
[SPEAKER_07]: Pay your artists their little, like, peanut or whatever in there.

721
00:54:33,337 --> 00:54:39,621
[SPEAKER_07]: Dancer X broke it down on DDR Freak the reasons why, and he was basically like, you know, you can have the repeats or you can have nothing or something like that.

722
00:54:39,661 --> 00:54:45,364
[SPEAKER_07]: But I'm like, you know what, I'm sorry, I respect their decision or whatever, but I don't agree with it.

723
00:54:45,404 --> 00:54:47,445
[SPEAKER_07]: I think they could have taken more 2DX songs.

724
00:54:48,346 --> 00:54:50,287
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know what they're saving it for, because...

725
00:54:51,247 --> 00:54:55,629
[SPEAKER_07]: as, you know, it's going to take another year before we see Max 3 or Extreme in the U.S., whatever it is.

726
00:54:57,730 --> 00:54:59,510
[SPEAKER_07]: If we even see it at all, they may not do one.

727
00:54:59,530 --> 00:55:02,671
[SPEAKER_07]: Why is it that, like, you can have... And by then we're on 9th and 10th style.

728
00:55:02,711 --> 00:55:03,572
[SPEAKER_07]: No, no, no, no.

729
00:55:03,672 --> 00:55:06,053
[SPEAKER_07]: Why is it that you can have, like, a person, like, say...

730
00:55:07,433 --> 00:55:08,193
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I don't know.

731
00:55:09,214 --> 00:55:16,396
[SPEAKER_07]: Healing, this guy goes by the name Healing Vision, or a guy that goes by the name Utter Dude, or the guy, you know, this Matt, I forget his last name.

732
00:55:16,776 --> 00:55:21,778
[SPEAKER_07]: Why can they pump out really quality, and this is talking about better than, you know, home version.

733
00:55:22,658 --> 00:55:23,740
[SPEAKER_07]: www.DarkSakura.com

734
00:55:40,160 --> 00:55:41,161
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to catch you on something.

735
00:55:41,741 --> 00:55:44,943
[SPEAKER_07]: Rumor is, it has not been confirmed that KOA actually did those steps.

736
00:55:45,063 --> 00:55:49,686
[SPEAKER_07]: Rumor is that KOJ might have done quite a few of them, especially the things that are going to show up in Extreme later.

737
00:55:49,706 --> 00:55:51,227
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, that's even worse!

738
00:55:51,567 --> 00:55:56,410
[SPEAKER_07]: But I'm just saying, the same people who've done all the steps before are probably still doing them for DDRMAX 2 USA.

739
00:55:56,450 --> 00:55:58,671
[SPEAKER_07]: It has not been confirmed that KOA has been doing them in-house.

740
00:56:01,117 --> 00:56:10,464
[SPEAKER_08]: You have to notice that a lot of the new original songs in Max 2 kind of get stuck with a lot of fucking freeze arrows, and you remember what happened in Max 1 with that.

741
00:56:11,144 --> 00:56:12,345
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, here's my suggestion.

742
00:56:12,385 --> 00:56:18,610
[SPEAKER_07]: Dear Konami, when you're going to put out Max 3 or Extreme or whatever the next thing is that's going to come out in the US, there better be something else.

743
00:56:19,711 --> 00:56:20,852
[SPEAKER_07]: Please have an edit bank.

744
00:56:22,785 --> 00:56:25,886
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, seriously, go with the databank just like last time.

745
00:56:25,986 --> 00:56:29,047
[SPEAKER_07]: This is what you need to link up to the old mixes.

746
00:56:29,467 --> 00:56:34,089
[SPEAKER_07]: Fuck this repeating put-your-faith-in-me stuff just because the damn song was in Konomics.

747
00:56:34,449 --> 00:56:41,871
[SPEAKER_07]: Bring up an edit bank that has steps to songs like Dark Black Forest, Japan, things that were in earlier mixes, and there you go.

748
00:56:42,191 --> 00:56:45,152
[SPEAKER_07]: Now people have a reason to get those old mixes because they want to see the databank.

749
00:56:45,192 --> 00:56:48,713
[SPEAKER_07]: And not only that, here's a few other things you can do.

750
00:56:49,934 --> 00:56:51,214
[SPEAKER_07]: Put in challenge mode.

751
00:56:52,006 --> 00:56:52,867
[SPEAKER_07]: Challenge mode back.

752
00:56:53,187 --> 00:56:55,929
[SPEAKER_06]: But instead, set it up like drill mode.

753
00:56:56,009 --> 00:57:00,072
[SPEAKER_07]: Not just challenge mode, I want a story mode to go with it, written by Jason Enos.

754
00:57:00,692 --> 00:57:02,393
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, that's retarded.

755
00:57:02,413 --> 00:57:06,456
[SPEAKER_15]: We do not need a story mode because then we'd be going back to one of the worst Konami games ever.

756
00:57:06,797 --> 00:57:07,797
[SPEAKER_15]: Dance, dance, dance.

757
00:57:08,878 --> 00:57:10,739
[SPEAKER_15]: With a little stupid RPG mode in it.

758
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:11,740
[SPEAKER_15]: Ugh, that game sucked.

759
00:57:11,900 --> 00:57:12,701
[SPEAKER_07]: Dance, dance, dance.

760
00:57:16,792 --> 00:57:18,473
[SPEAKER_15]: Dance, Dance, Dance started the Bimani thing.

761
00:57:18,513 --> 00:57:19,873
[SPEAKER_15]: It did not begin with Beatmania.

762
00:57:19,953 --> 00:57:25,476
[SPEAKER_15]: The style of game came with Beatmania, but the whole music game thing started with Dance, Dance, Dance, and the game flows.

763
00:57:26,056 --> 00:57:36,821
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyways, yeah, challenge mode for sure, but set up like drill mode, because in that way you can have drill mode as being both a training lesson mode thing and a challenge mode at the same time.

764
00:57:37,922 --> 00:57:38,923
[SPEAKER_07]: And drill modes are fun.

765
00:57:38,963 --> 00:57:41,827
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it takes you a long time to go through and you can incorporate that.

766
00:57:42,248 --> 00:57:43,149
[SPEAKER_07]: That and the unlocks.

767
00:57:43,349 --> 00:57:47,114
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't make a song get unlocked after ten songs.

768
00:57:47,354 --> 00:57:53,483
[SPEAKER_07]: Seriously, we play like a full two sets of songs, you know, five songs each, and we get an unlock.

769
00:57:54,063 --> 00:57:54,784
[SPEAKER_07]: That's recorded.

770
00:57:54,984 --> 00:57:59,708
[SPEAKER_07]: But what do you say to the people that disagree with you and say, you know what, fuck the unlocks, just have it all to begin with.

771
00:57:59,848 --> 00:58:01,450
[SPEAKER_07]: Why do we even waste our time unlocking things?

772
00:58:01,470 --> 00:58:02,911
[SPEAKER_07]: Just blow your load in the beginning.

773
00:58:03,011 --> 00:58:05,753
[SPEAKER_07]: Because there's no point in playing the game then if you have no purpose to play the game.

774
00:58:05,973 --> 00:58:08,015
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, what about playing the songs and dancing to them?

775
00:58:08,035 --> 00:58:08,776
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what you do in DDR.

776
00:58:08,816 --> 00:58:09,757
[SPEAKER_07]: You have to have a goal.

777
00:58:09,857 --> 00:58:11,178
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to get boring faster.

778
00:58:12,559 --> 00:58:13,060
[SPEAKER_07]: What would you think?

779
00:58:13,080 --> 00:58:19,065
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, I think, but we know this is never going to happen because Konami of America is not going to put out an arcade machine, but let's say KOJ does this.

780
00:58:19,779 --> 00:58:24,483
[SPEAKER_07]: An F-Zero type unlock system where you have to go back and forth between the arcade and the home version to unlock things.

781
00:58:25,284 --> 00:58:26,825
[SPEAKER_07]: It would be cool, but it'll never work.

782
00:58:28,506 --> 00:58:30,348
[SPEAKER_07]: Because they'll never make an arcade version.

783
00:58:34,972 --> 00:58:35,292
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway.

784
00:58:38,151 --> 00:58:42,954
[SPEAKER_07]: We'd be interested in your suggestions as well for Max 3 USA or Extreme, whatever it's called.

785
00:58:42,994 --> 00:58:44,275
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, let's just put it this way.

786
00:58:44,315 --> 00:58:46,616
[SPEAKER_07]: www.caliabomani.com, click on Orange Lounge and click on Chat.

787
00:58:46,916 --> 00:58:54,581
[SPEAKER_07]: Once I get the freaking cabinet done in here, and you see how I have the sim set up with all the songs, and there's going to be unlocks in there.

788
00:58:55,535 --> 00:58:59,019
[SPEAKER_07]: This is how the damn game should be, like my home cabinet.

789
00:58:59,480 --> 00:59:03,764
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to have quality songs in there because I don't pay licensing rights to anyone.

790
00:59:05,186 --> 00:59:07,869
[SPEAKER_08]: You should make multiple machines and then sell them.

791
00:59:08,670 --> 00:59:10,232
[SPEAKER_08]: You should go suck my cock.

792
00:59:18,837 --> 00:59:20,439
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, what time is it?

793
00:59:20,479 --> 00:59:22,201
[SPEAKER_05]: We need to record the time.

794
00:59:22,561 --> 00:59:23,763
[SPEAKER_05]: NoStylin has a great one.

795
00:59:24,183 --> 00:59:28,228
[SPEAKER_07]: He says the unlock should be nude images of Konami staff.

796
00:59:28,448 --> 00:59:29,069
[SPEAKER_07]: Ah, just kidding.

797
00:59:29,089 --> 00:59:29,930
[SPEAKER_08]: Jason Enos.

798
00:59:33,499 --> 00:59:37,663
[SPEAKER_06]: No, but there's, okay, there's a lot of stuff.

799
00:59:40,186 --> 00:59:43,329
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's talk about some of the other stuff that's also that they could have done.

800
00:59:43,870 --> 00:59:47,834
[SPEAKER_07]: Another thing I came up with a while back was routine videos.

801
00:59:47,894 --> 00:59:56,703
[SPEAKER_07]: Something similar to like, you know, where you have ParaPara, where you've got freestyle, which would be the standard, you know, basic trick maniac, you know, for old school people.

802
00:59:57,203 --> 01:00:05,190
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, then you've got, like, you know, routine mode, where it's another set of steps, but it goes with, like, a dancing character on screen where you do what they do, and it kind of goes with that.

803
01:00:05,670 --> 01:00:08,092
[SPEAKER_07]: So, like, uh, learn how to freestyle like Mel B?

804
01:00:08,333 --> 01:00:09,414
[SPEAKER_10]: No, no, see?

805
01:00:09,834 --> 01:00:20,243
[SPEAKER_10]: See, the problem with that is that... The problem with that is that now you're going to have a bunch of little unshowered teeny-bopper idiots freestyling exactly the same routine, and that's really bad.

806
01:00:20,883 --> 01:00:24,006
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, as opposed to a bunch of stupid Asians peri-peri?

807
01:00:24,026 --> 01:00:24,947
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, seriously!

808
01:00:26,215 --> 01:00:27,916
[SPEAKER_09]: Cara is dead, okay?

809
01:00:29,297 --> 01:00:33,219
[SPEAKER_09]: It was cool until they made the videos and put it on the machine.

810
01:00:34,339 --> 01:00:45,845
[SPEAKER_07]: I would be fine with Konami doing a learn how to freestyle like us thing as long as, and I preface this with a disclaimer, views and opinions expressed by me do not express those that weren't on the video, as long as it's not 8-Ball.

811
01:00:50,964 --> 01:00:52,325
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, I can't make a comment.

812
01:00:52,446 --> 01:00:53,767
[SPEAKER_15]: I cannot make a comment.

813
01:00:54,048 --> 01:00:55,770
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll take your silence as your comment.

814
01:00:57,712 --> 01:01:01,136
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I still have stuff to say about that idea for freestyling.

815
01:01:01,236 --> 01:01:02,718
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, then they're all going to...

816
01:01:03,171 --> 01:01:04,352
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com

817
01:01:22,628 --> 01:01:26,690
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, it's better than, um, so basically it's gonna be based off of that routine there.

818
01:01:26,850 --> 01:01:30,612
[SPEAKER_07]: Gee, like, no one bases their routines off of, like, music videos or anything.

819
01:01:30,932 --> 01:01:32,312
[SPEAKER_07]: No one emulates anybody.

820
01:01:32,352 --> 01:01:33,353
[SPEAKER_07]: They're all original.

821
01:01:34,814 --> 01:01:38,055
[SPEAKER_10]: Then again, do you really want people just imitating the home versions?

822
01:01:39,596 --> 01:01:46,799
[SPEAKER_07]: It's better than watching people hump the bar, jump over the bar, run across the screen, hand slap, knee drop, and act like idiots.

823
01:01:47,737 --> 01:01:51,299
[SPEAKER_15]: No, I don't mind people jumping over the bar for the few times that they miss and nut themselves.

824
01:01:51,519 --> 01:02:07,650
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, well that's fine, but other than that though, well other than freestyle mode or whatever that would be, my other idea was, now StepMedia has kind of done this, they have a mode in it called Mines, which is kind of neat.

825
01:02:07,970 --> 01:02:15,835
[SPEAKER_07]: There's steps that go up, like arrows and stuff, normal, whatever, I don't know if it's randomly generated or whatever, but there's also steps that you can't step on.

826
01:02:16,315 --> 01:02:17,936
[SPEAKER_07]: If you step on them, you lose health.

827
01:02:18,076 --> 01:02:19,017
[SPEAKER_07]: This is what I've been saying.

828
01:02:19,157 --> 01:02:22,239
[SPEAKER_07]: If DDR is going to come back in Japan, it needs to be competitive.

829
01:02:22,259 --> 01:02:23,959
[SPEAKER_07]: I've said this like five out of the last ten shows.

830
01:02:24,180 --> 01:02:30,323
[SPEAKER_07]: DDR needs to come back competitive, as a competitive game, as opposed to, let's have fun and hold hands and dance and play cooperative.

831
01:02:30,423 --> 01:02:32,965
[SPEAKER_23]: Everybody dance!

832
01:02:33,045 --> 01:02:34,626
[SPEAKER_07]: And it needs to be fucking hardcore.

833
01:02:37,157 --> 01:02:44,319
[SPEAKER_07]: Or, you know, like they have Second Mix Battle, needs to be something like that in there, they need something like Dance Magic, they need just anything that's competitive.

834
01:02:44,359 --> 01:02:49,961
[SPEAKER_06]: I want, I want at the very end of each battle round, there'd be smoke coming out of the middle of the city, and strobe lights!

835
01:02:50,361 --> 01:02:52,321
[SPEAKER_07]: Strobe lights, lots of strobe lights.

836
01:02:53,322 --> 01:02:57,923
[SPEAKER_07]: Exactly, I want, I want Unison, I want all that shit back.

837
01:02:58,603 --> 01:03:00,904
[SPEAKER_15]: I want Second Mix version Dance Battle.

838
01:03:02,136 --> 01:03:06,459
[SPEAKER_07]: DDR has gotten fucking tame as it's been going along, and it's time for DDR to get mean.

839
01:03:08,020 --> 01:03:10,402
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you know how easy tournaments would be?

840
01:03:10,642 --> 01:03:12,483
[SPEAKER_07]: You know how easy and common tournaments would be?

841
01:03:14,825 --> 01:03:17,767
[SPEAKER_07]: They should have tournament mode, where it's just already set up in the cabinet.

842
01:03:20,228 --> 01:03:22,590
[SPEAKER_07]: But, uh, yeah.

843
01:03:22,950 --> 01:03:23,831
[SPEAKER_07]: What else could they have?

844
01:03:26,061 --> 01:03:31,063
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, definitely like some new sort of unlocks, you know.

845
01:03:32,444 --> 01:03:35,585
[SPEAKER_07]: I liked kind of like Max USA's unlocks.

846
01:03:36,265 --> 01:03:36,946
[SPEAKER_07]: It was weird.

847
01:03:37,146 --> 01:03:40,787
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, where you could get it by doing the songs.

848
01:03:41,067 --> 01:03:42,348
[SPEAKER_07]: You had to do a lot more songs.

849
01:03:42,368 --> 01:03:44,649
[SPEAKER_07]: You had to do 500 songs to get Drop the Bomb.

850
01:03:44,729 --> 01:03:45,669
[SPEAKER_07]: That was worth it.

851
01:03:45,949 --> 01:03:49,091
[SPEAKER_07]: But you could do other little stupid things to get them, too.

852
01:03:49,131 --> 01:03:49,451
[SPEAKER_07]: You're right.

853
01:03:49,491 --> 01:03:53,673
[SPEAKER_07]: They need to find a happy medium between Max USA and Max 2 USA.

854
01:03:54,993 --> 01:04:04,882
[SPEAKER_07]: Because Max would say, I got tired of playing like 500 songs to get the next unlock, but I also got tired of playing just 10 songs and getting the unlocks super fast.

855
01:04:05,202 --> 01:04:09,666
[SPEAKER_07]: So they need to kind of balance it out in the middle there somewhere, and that'd be kind of cool.

856
01:04:10,166 --> 01:04:18,173
[SPEAKER_07]: It's funny because when Marin in the chatroom says, Get mean, DDR, runs around biting people, rawr, it makes me think, if they want DDR to get good, just inject a little SARS into it.

857
01:04:18,553 --> 01:04:19,014
[SPEAKER_07]: Rawr!

858
01:04:20,576 --> 01:04:21,057
[SPEAKER_07]: Rage.

859
01:04:22,560 --> 01:04:23,481
[SPEAKER_07]: Induce rage.

860
01:04:23,501 --> 01:04:25,625
[SPEAKER_07]: DDR Rabid Wolf Mix.

861
01:04:29,085 --> 01:04:30,366
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, I think we're going to take a quick break.

862
01:04:30,386 --> 01:04:31,086
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to do some more.

863
01:04:31,146 --> 01:04:32,127
[SPEAKER_07]: Ooh, ooh, ooh.

864
01:04:32,287 --> 01:04:33,587
[SPEAKER_07]: Here's a really great idea.

865
01:04:33,887 --> 01:04:38,770
[SPEAKER_07]: Have a song similar to, I think it was in Space, no, not Space Shelf 5.

866
01:04:38,890 --> 01:04:43,532
[SPEAKER_07]: It was in that Buster Move game or whatever that we were playing a while back.

867
01:04:43,572 --> 01:04:44,133
[SPEAKER_07]: Dance Summit?

868
01:04:44,213 --> 01:04:44,793
[SPEAKER_07]: Dance Summit.

869
01:04:45,153 --> 01:04:49,856
[SPEAKER_07]: Where if you do good in a song or do perfect or whatever, that the song changes.

870
01:04:51,016 --> 01:04:52,517
[SPEAKER_07]: Like it kind of remixes itself.

871
01:04:52,557 --> 01:04:53,397
[SPEAKER_07]: That would be kind of weird.

872
01:04:54,078 --> 01:04:54,558
[SPEAKER_07]: But it would be cool.

873
01:04:55,649 --> 01:04:56,229
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, I'm done.

874
01:04:56,730 --> 01:04:58,291
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, we're going to take a quick break.

875
01:04:58,331 --> 01:05:00,412
[SPEAKER_07]: In this break, we're going to hear Heaven.

876
01:05:00,632 --> 01:05:06,296
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a big one because this was the number one requested licensed song, Please Get It, and Konami did it.

877
01:05:06,516 --> 01:05:07,176
[SPEAKER_07]: They got Heaven.

878
01:05:07,617 --> 01:05:15,442
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to hear the mix of that that's in DDR Max 2 USA, and then we're also going to hear I Need You, which is one of the songs, is a Konami original that has not been in DDR or any Bomani game before.

879
01:05:16,082 --> 01:05:20,305
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we'll also hear Keep On Lifton, that song from Beatmania 3 that made it into Max 2 USA.

880
01:05:20,845 --> 01:05:21,646
[SPEAKER_07]: When we come back...

881
01:05:22,367 --> 01:05:26,511
[SPEAKER_07]: Since we haven't gotten around to it yet, we usually kick off the show with it, but a lot of people have some stories they want to tell.

882
01:05:26,551 --> 01:05:28,733
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to get into how was your day, how was your week when we come back.

883
01:05:31,255 --> 01:05:41,824
[SPEAKER_20]: Baby, you're all that I want When you're lying here in my arms I'm finding it hard to believe We're in heaven

884
01:07:48,567 --> 01:07:48,809
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

885
01:08:49,014 --> 01:08:49,734
[SPEAKER_26]: Uh, yeah.

886
01:08:50,715 --> 01:08:51,455
[SPEAKER_26]: And you don't stop.

887
01:08:52,476 --> 01:08:52,876
[SPEAKER_26]: Come on.

888
01:09:53,524 --> 01:09:54,165
Thanks for watching!

889
01:10:26,245 --> 01:10:31,541
[SPEAKER_00]: Rock Over London, Rock Over Chicago, Orange Lounge Radio It's a good place to listen to the music

890
01:10:34,440 --> 01:10:37,281
[SPEAKER_07]: Makes me sad, Wesley Willis, dead and gone.

891
01:10:37,682 --> 01:10:38,082
[SPEAKER_07]: I cry.

892
01:10:39,302 --> 01:10:48,547
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, as promised, now's the part of the show where we go around and talk to our guests and we talk about how was your week and how was your day.

893
01:10:48,587 --> 01:10:50,548
[SPEAKER_07]: And I know some people have some exciting things to talk about.

894
01:10:50,568 --> 01:10:54,810
[SPEAKER_07]: I, for one, I want to talk about, well, we'll get to that when we get to me.

895
01:10:55,130 --> 01:10:56,111
[SPEAKER_07]: Who wants to start tonight?

896
01:10:57,151 --> 01:10:57,991
[SPEAKER_07]: You always do, Jamie?

897
01:10:58,011 --> 01:10:58,452
[SPEAKER_07]: Go for it.

898
01:10:58,892 --> 01:11:00,993
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't know you always did, but fine, do it.

899
01:11:03,354 --> 01:11:04,735
[SPEAKER_07]: Jamie's shoving a peanut in her mouth.

900
01:11:05,316 --> 01:11:06,777
[SPEAKER_07]: What if other people want to go first today?

901
01:11:07,017 --> 01:11:08,298
[SPEAKER_07]: What if other people want to go first today?

902
01:11:09,239 --> 01:11:10,540
[SPEAKER_15]: Screw them.

903
01:11:12,922 --> 01:11:15,804
[SPEAKER_15]: My week has been okay.

904
01:11:16,905 --> 01:11:18,106
[SPEAKER_15]: I've been sleep deprived all week.

905
01:11:18,126 --> 01:11:19,968
[SPEAKER_15]: I haven't gotten more than four hours of sleep a night.

906
01:11:21,329 --> 01:11:23,791
[SPEAKER_15]: So I crashed really bad on Friday night.

907
01:11:24,251 --> 01:11:25,432
[SPEAKER_15]: I stayed up as late as I could.

908
01:11:25,452 --> 01:11:26,633
[SPEAKER_15]: I was supposed to play Phantasy Star.

909
01:11:27,173 --> 01:11:27,333
[SPEAKER_15]: Uh-uh.

910
01:11:28,735 --> 01:11:30,976
[SPEAKER_15]: I barely had enough of an attention span for Ragnarok.

911
01:11:32,378 --> 01:11:32,678
[SPEAKER_15]: So, uh,

912
01:11:33,553 --> 01:11:35,253
[SPEAKER_15]: I passed out like at 2 a.m.

913
01:11:35,933 --> 01:11:38,954
[SPEAKER_15]: Got up at 11.30ish, something like that.

914
01:11:39,734 --> 01:11:44,335
[SPEAKER_15]: I went out and hung out with Iguana Girl all weekend, well, all Saturday.

915
01:11:45,095 --> 01:11:47,396
[SPEAKER_15]: And we bought iguana food for Moo.

916
01:11:48,776 --> 01:11:56,397
[SPEAKER_15]: And watched, like, Life of Brian and Jay and Silent Bob back-to-back while cutting up greens.

917
01:11:56,417 --> 01:11:57,117
[SPEAKER_15]: My fingers turned green.

918
01:11:58,197 --> 01:11:59,618
[SPEAKER_15]: It was scary.

919
01:11:59,918 --> 01:12:00,898
[SPEAKER_15]: I played DDR Thursday.

920
01:12:02,176 --> 01:12:07,580
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh my gosh, okay, you have to realize the past like three weeks, I go here, Jamie, do you have anything Bomani related you want to tell us?

921
01:12:07,940 --> 01:12:08,240
[SPEAKER_22]: No.

922
01:12:09,941 --> 01:12:22,629
[SPEAKER_07]: You made an interesting live journal entry, and I know you keep your live journal friends only, but maybe this is one you wouldn't mind sharing, kind of about what you were saying about... 40 minutes of DDR is 306 calories burned.

923
01:12:23,329 --> 01:12:27,252
[SPEAKER_15]: And that's just like, you know, on the medium mode on workout, on workout mode.

924
01:12:28,411 --> 01:12:29,692
[SPEAKER_15]: on the old Max.

925
01:12:30,993 --> 01:12:31,413
[SPEAKER_07]: Max USA 1.

926
01:12:31,453 --> 01:12:33,375
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, because that was before I got my Max 2.

927
01:12:34,656 --> 01:12:35,296
[SPEAKER_15]: And you know what?

928
01:12:35,376 --> 01:12:36,117
[SPEAKER_15]: It was pretty fun.

929
01:12:37,318 --> 01:12:38,699
[SPEAKER_15]: I was really tired and everything.

930
01:12:39,159 --> 01:12:40,841
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, this was Thursday.

931
01:12:43,103 --> 01:12:43,603
[SPEAKER_15]: No, take that back.

932
01:12:43,643 --> 01:12:44,203
[SPEAKER_15]: It wasn't Thursday.

933
01:12:44,223 --> 01:12:44,724
[SPEAKER_15]: It was Wednesday.

934
01:12:45,845 --> 01:12:46,365
[SPEAKER_15]: Something like that.

935
01:12:46,766 --> 01:12:47,987
[SPEAKER_15]: But anyway, it was...

936
01:12:49,326 --> 01:12:54,147
[SPEAKER_15]: I was still really tired, and I've been so tired all week that I really haven't been able to put much more effort into it.

937
01:12:54,667 --> 01:13:00,169
[SPEAKER_15]: But, you know, that's how, when I first started playing DDR, I played for an hour every night.

938
01:13:00,489 --> 01:13:01,529
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, more than an hour.

939
01:13:01,629 --> 01:13:04,270
[SPEAKER_15]: I would do like two hours of nothing but not stopping on second mix.

940
01:13:05,650 --> 01:13:07,451
[SPEAKER_15]: And I'm thinking that that's what I'm going to do again.

941
01:13:07,991 --> 01:13:09,191
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, better living through DDR.

942
01:13:09,733 --> 01:13:13,415
[SPEAKER_07]: Seriously, I'm going to lose weight if I play more DDR.

943
01:13:13,776 --> 01:13:14,656
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll lose weight again.

944
01:13:14,716 --> 01:13:19,539
[SPEAKER_15]: So I'm going to get back into playing and mixing that with going to the gym.

945
01:13:20,240 --> 01:13:25,583
[SPEAKER_15]: And Saturday, I got milk tea and boiled peanuts.

946
01:13:26,664 --> 01:13:37,891
[SPEAKER_15]: And I don't know how many people know anything about living in the South, but I haven't, for years, I haven't been able to find boiled peanuts until I moved out here.

947
01:13:39,036 --> 01:13:41,177
[SPEAKER_15]: And so I started shopping at the Asian food stores.

948
01:13:42,037 --> 01:13:43,418
[SPEAKER_15]: So I was like, boiled peanuts.

949
01:13:44,078 --> 01:13:45,838
[SPEAKER_15]: And they were, you know, fresh boiled peanuts and everything.

950
01:13:45,858 --> 01:13:46,379
[SPEAKER_15]: They were really good.

951
01:13:48,159 --> 01:13:56,242
[SPEAKER_15]: And anyway, I got some goodies.

952
01:13:56,262 --> 01:13:57,222
[SPEAKER_15]: I have lots of them at home.

953
01:13:58,243 --> 01:13:59,443
[SPEAKER_15]: Picked up some treats for people.

954
01:14:01,764 --> 01:14:05,565
[SPEAKER_15]: But boiled peanuts, that was like the highlight of my weekend was boiled peanuts.

955
01:14:08,078 --> 01:14:08,638
[SPEAKER_15]: I never get them.

956
01:14:09,058 --> 01:14:11,499
[SPEAKER_15]: The one thing that I wish I could find is blood peanuts in a can.

957
01:14:12,580 --> 01:14:15,480
[SPEAKER_15]: I've not been able to find those anywhere outside the South.

958
01:14:16,541 --> 01:14:19,242
[SPEAKER_15]: So that's been my... Yeah, and I've been busy with other stuff.

959
01:14:19,522 --> 01:14:23,703
[SPEAKER_15]: The really crappy drama thing seems to have subsided, which I'm pretty glad for.

960
01:14:25,264 --> 01:14:25,944
[SPEAKER_07]: There was drama?

961
01:14:27,316 --> 01:14:33,277
[SPEAKER_15]: There was drama involving a site, but it's pretty much resolved.

962
01:14:33,677 --> 01:14:38,479
[SPEAKER_15]: I've just been feeling really crappy all week, you know, in general, but it hasn't been a bad week.

963
01:14:39,639 --> 01:14:43,680
[SPEAKER_15]: So, and they can't hear any of your commentary because you're busy sucking nuts.

964
01:14:47,441 --> 01:14:48,981
[SPEAKER_15]: The look on your face is great.

965
01:14:51,101 --> 01:14:51,962
[SPEAKER_15]: My nuts are good.

966
01:14:52,062 --> 01:14:53,102
[SPEAKER_15]: They're safe for consumption.

967
01:14:55,997 --> 01:14:56,297
[SPEAKER_15]: Anyway.

968
01:14:56,557 --> 01:14:56,897
[SPEAKER_07]: You're done?

969
01:14:57,797 --> 01:14:58,358
[SPEAKER_15]: Geez!

970
01:14:58,378 --> 01:15:00,718
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I'm just saying, are you done?

971
01:15:00,778 --> 01:15:01,158
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

972
01:15:01,758 --> 01:15:02,599
[SPEAKER_15]: Are you done?

973
01:15:02,879 --> 01:15:06,699
[SPEAKER_07]: Aaron's got her hand out, so... Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob.

974
01:15:06,739 --> 01:15:07,380
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

975
01:15:07,740 --> 01:15:07,980
[SPEAKER_32]: Rob.

976
01:15:08,420 --> 01:15:08,680
[SPEAKER_32]: What?

977
01:15:08,960 --> 01:15:09,260
[SPEAKER_32]: Rob.

978
01:15:09,440 --> 01:15:09,660
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

979
01:15:10,080 --> 01:15:10,300
[SPEAKER_32]: Rob.

980
01:15:10,560 --> 01:15:10,820
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

981
01:15:11,160 --> 01:15:11,360
[SPEAKER_32]: Hi.

982
01:15:11,721 --> 01:15:11,921
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi.

983
01:15:13,241 --> 01:15:15,081
[SPEAKER_07]: Aaron, how was your week?

984
01:15:15,101 --> 01:15:15,661
[SPEAKER_07]: How was your day?

985
01:15:16,281 --> 01:15:21,863
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, well, for those of you who know, X and I sent, aka Claudia, has officially got me addicted to Initial D!

986
01:15:21,883 --> 01:15:22,703
[SPEAKER_03]: Boo!

987
01:15:22,723 --> 01:15:22,803
[SPEAKER_03]: Boo!

988
01:15:23,573 --> 01:15:24,134
[SPEAKER_03]: Damn her.

989
01:15:24,774 --> 01:15:25,375
[SPEAKER_03]: Just kidding.

990
01:15:25,715 --> 01:15:29,758
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I spent a total of at least $10 on the game.

991
01:15:29,778 --> 01:15:35,263
[SPEAKER_10]: Because it's only like 40 cents at the MU to play.

992
01:15:35,944 --> 01:15:38,326
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's five tokens to a dollar.

993
01:15:38,466 --> 01:15:40,548
[SPEAKER_10]: So two tokens per game.

994
01:15:40,748 --> 01:15:41,849
[SPEAKER_10]: So yeah, five games for $2.

995
01:15:41,889 --> 01:15:42,129
[SPEAKER_10]: Good shit.

996
01:15:45,206 --> 01:15:53,370
[SPEAKER_10]: Also, I started school this week, and workload 57, English 57, which is a stupid little remedial English class, feels just like high school!

997
01:15:54,531 --> 01:15:55,151
[SPEAKER_10]: Unfortunately.

998
01:15:55,531 --> 01:15:56,452
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm stuck there.

999
01:15:56,992 --> 01:15:57,652
[SPEAKER_10]: For a quarter.

1000
01:15:58,893 --> 01:15:59,253
[SPEAKER_10]: And yeah.

1001
01:15:59,573 --> 01:16:02,495
[SPEAKER_07]: I have to interject real fast, because the chatroom won't shut up about this.

1002
01:16:02,795 --> 01:16:07,297
[SPEAKER_07]: Chatroom, I assure you, we will play Overloaded in the afterbirth again, okay?

1003
01:16:08,057 --> 01:16:08,517
[SPEAKER_07]: There you go.

1004
01:16:09,038 --> 01:16:09,318
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

1005
01:16:09,598 --> 01:16:11,159
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, ViolentHyperGirl, go ahead.

1006
01:16:11,479 --> 01:16:13,620
[SPEAKER_10]: And Holly says, can I have your salty nuts?

1007
01:16:15,309 --> 01:16:15,950
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, sure.

1008
01:16:16,370 --> 01:16:17,951
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, sorry to interrupt.

1009
01:16:17,971 --> 01:16:18,552
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you want to finish?

1010
01:16:18,572 --> 01:16:19,272
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, yeah.

1011
01:16:19,753 --> 01:16:22,475
[SPEAKER_10]: I actually didn't get lost on campus for my first day of school.

1012
01:16:22,675 --> 01:16:23,115
[SPEAKER_10]: Woohoo!

1013
01:16:24,216 --> 01:16:28,620
[SPEAKER_10]: And I've also become quite popular in the dorms after playing piano so many times.

1014
01:16:29,180 --> 01:16:31,162
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, you're already popular in the dorms, huh?

1015
01:16:31,262 --> 01:16:33,143
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey!

1016
01:16:33,203 --> 01:16:34,024
[SPEAKER_10]: Not that way!

1017
01:16:37,155 --> 01:16:40,517
[SPEAKER_10]: But yeah, other than that, we kind of settled in.

1018
01:16:40,637 --> 01:16:42,158
[SPEAKER_10]: Our apartment's cooled down considerably.

1019
01:16:42,218 --> 01:16:46,819
[SPEAKER_10]: Davis has only been hitting upwards of, at best, 90 this past week.

1020
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:48,960
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, it's been pretty good.

1021
01:16:51,381 --> 01:16:52,102
[SPEAKER_10]: And let's see.

1022
01:16:52,742 --> 01:16:53,642
[SPEAKER_08]: Anything special today?

1023
01:16:54,683 --> 01:16:59,925
[SPEAKER_10]: No, not really, other than it's good to be on Orange Lounge when there's no internet problems.

1024
01:17:00,376 --> 01:17:02,937
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's nice to be here on a week where the station works, huh?

1025
01:17:03,518 --> 01:17:06,439
[SPEAKER_07]: For those of you that missed last week, you're better off, okay?

1026
01:17:06,519 --> 01:17:07,159
[SPEAKER_07]: Just trust us.

1027
01:17:08,120 --> 01:17:08,600
[SPEAKER_07]: We wrote it off.

1028
01:17:08,880 --> 01:17:09,421
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what, though?

1029
01:17:09,461 --> 01:17:14,503
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what's interesting about last week's show, and I didn't realize this until I was going back and clipping it down for the archives?

1030
01:17:14,723 --> 01:17:14,983
[SPEAKER_10]: What?

1031
01:17:15,444 --> 01:17:18,445
[SPEAKER_07]: We did not take a single break last week at all.

1032
01:17:18,465 --> 01:17:19,406
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, you didn't notice that?

1033
01:17:19,446 --> 01:17:19,706
[SPEAKER_10]: We never...

1034
01:17:20,663 --> 01:17:22,265
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't notice that we did two hours straight.

1035
01:17:22,525 --> 01:17:30,033
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you think about it, even though a lot of people were kind of like, oh, you guys only did two hours, you know, with all the problems, even though we dropped you guys 37 times thanks to Comcast.

1036
01:17:31,114 --> 01:17:37,561
[SPEAKER_07]: If you think about it, with two hours straight of content, you know, throw breaks, you didn't lose that much of a show, so shut up.

1037
01:17:38,682 --> 01:17:39,723
[SPEAKER_07]: That's my point, shut up.

1038
01:17:40,359 --> 01:17:40,939
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, alright.

1039
01:17:41,660 --> 01:17:44,842
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's see, other than that, I've actually had my room to myself.

1040
01:17:44,883 --> 01:17:47,324
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm supposed to be sharing my room with my friend, but she hasn't been home.

1041
01:17:47,745 --> 01:17:48,185
[SPEAKER_07]: Lucky you.

1042
01:17:48,485 --> 01:17:49,786
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, does she have a boyfriend?

1043
01:17:49,966 --> 01:17:51,428
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, she's been spending... See, there you go.

1044
01:17:51,668 --> 01:17:57,772
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what always happens in college, is that, you know, my roommate was the same way indoors, that he was rushing a fraternity, so he was sleeping with all his boyfriends.

1045
01:18:00,435 --> 01:18:03,497
[SPEAKER_10]: And we all probably know what he was doing with all of them.

1046
01:18:04,640 --> 01:18:12,246
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, no, he also had a girlfriend that lived upstairs and he was staying there sometimes because the one time she came to stay there, I had a fit, okay?

1047
01:18:12,386 --> 01:18:18,690
[SPEAKER_07]: I was just like, I don't feel comfortable with her being here in the morning when I'm waking up.

1048
01:18:18,730 --> 01:18:20,752
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just like, that's weird.

1049
01:18:21,972 --> 01:18:22,193
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1050
01:18:23,213 --> 01:18:25,635
[SPEAKER_10]: But yeah, okay, so anyone else want to talk about their week?

1051
01:18:25,995 --> 01:18:26,656
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, so you're done.

1052
01:18:27,336 --> 01:18:29,137
[SPEAKER_07]: Bradley, you have anything you want to share about your week and your day?

1053
01:18:31,419 --> 01:18:31,959
[SPEAKER_07]: How was your week?

1054
01:18:31,999 --> 01:18:32,800
[SPEAKER_07]: How was your day, Bradley?

1055
01:18:33,601 --> 01:18:33,921
[SPEAKER_07]: Hold on.

1056
01:18:34,910 --> 01:18:35,991
[SPEAKER_07]: It's caught on the other one.

1057
01:18:38,594 --> 01:18:39,314
[SPEAKER_08]: Take it away.

1058
01:18:40,555 --> 01:18:41,156
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

1059
01:18:42,457 --> 01:18:43,218
[SPEAKER_08]: Unchlorial.

1060
01:18:44,839 --> 01:18:46,861
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't do all that much this week.

1061
01:18:47,021 --> 01:18:53,107
[SPEAKER_08]: I... Every so often... Most of it was being lazy for most of the day.

1062
01:18:53,667 --> 01:18:54,388
[SPEAKER_08]: Punctuated by...

1063
01:18:55,589 --> 01:18:56,110
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for watching.

1064
01:18:56,130 --> 01:18:56,651
[SPEAKER_08]: See you next time.

1065
01:19:12,313 --> 01:19:18,877
[SPEAKER_07]: Hello, if you're out there and you want to hire somebody, Arcadian42, Bradley, hire him.

1066
01:19:20,759 --> 01:19:23,921
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, most of it's because I'm stupid and it took too long to do stuff.

1067
01:19:24,381 --> 01:19:25,922
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway, and let's see, what else?

1068
01:19:26,002 --> 01:19:27,123
[SPEAKER_08]: Anything else I did this week?

1069
01:19:28,744 --> 01:19:29,724
[SPEAKER_07]: What else might I have done?

1070
01:19:32,751 --> 01:19:34,332
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, I don't think I went anywhere any time this week.

1071
01:19:34,513 --> 01:19:37,956
[SPEAKER_07]: Except for Wednesday, I came over here and played some DDR Max 2.

1072
01:19:39,097 --> 01:19:40,558
[SPEAKER_07]: Since I only have the Japanese version.

1073
01:19:40,618 --> 01:19:44,041
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't have a US PS2, so I got to experience that.

1074
01:19:44,281 --> 01:19:44,622
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, good.

1075
01:19:44,722 --> 01:19:45,002
[SPEAKER_07]: Good deal.

1076
01:19:46,010 --> 01:19:49,171
[SPEAKER_07]: He went to... He went away.

1077
01:19:49,771 --> 01:19:51,412
[SPEAKER_06]: Went far, far away.

1078
01:19:52,433 --> 01:19:53,373
[SPEAKER_06]: To get power.

1079
01:19:54,593 --> 01:19:55,254
[SPEAKER_06]: Staying in.

1080
01:19:56,234 --> 01:19:56,674
[SPEAKER_07]: There he is.

1081
01:19:56,834 --> 01:19:58,235
[SPEAKER_07]: I should have made him get me something too.

1082
01:19:58,315 --> 01:20:00,756
[SPEAKER_07]: I should have sent him a shopping list.

1083
01:20:00,796 --> 01:20:01,316
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, go back!

1084
01:20:01,336 --> 01:20:04,637
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't go anywhere yesterday.

1085
01:20:04,897 --> 01:20:05,878
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought I went somewhere yesterday.

1086
01:20:05,898 --> 01:20:07,658
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, crap.

1087
01:20:07,998 --> 01:20:08,879
[SPEAKER_07]: Now I can't remember where I went.

1088
01:20:09,439 --> 01:20:10,619
[SPEAKER_07]: I think I might have went to Walmart.

1089
01:20:10,900 --> 01:20:11,680
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, I went to Walmart today.

1090
01:20:14,013 --> 01:20:15,214
[SPEAKER_07]: Damn, I'm so forgettable.

1091
01:20:15,234 --> 01:20:16,815
[SPEAKER_07]: I can do one thing and I forget what I did.

1092
01:20:18,376 --> 01:20:23,359
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, actually I went to the post office to mail stuff I sold off.

1093
01:20:25,080 --> 01:20:33,344
[SPEAKER_07]: And then today I watched the debate from Wednesday for the governor's debate.

1094
01:20:34,285 --> 01:20:35,085
[SPEAKER_07]: Them being silly.

1095
01:20:35,426 --> 01:20:40,909
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it was sort of okay, not all that great of a debate.

1096
01:20:42,262 --> 01:20:44,444
[SPEAKER_07]: Arnold didn't really impress me all that much.

1097
01:20:45,645 --> 01:20:50,930
[SPEAKER_07]: He was more impressed by when he was on, what's his face, Larry King.

1098
01:20:51,570 --> 01:20:57,055
[SPEAKER_07]: He was a bit more... No, no, he was on Larry King like two weeks ago.

1099
01:20:59,917 --> 01:21:02,900
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's pretty much my week.

1100
01:21:05,111 --> 01:21:05,812
[SPEAKER_09]: So exciting!

1101
01:21:06,172 --> 01:21:07,012
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, thanks for sharing.

1102
01:21:07,033 --> 01:21:09,875
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry you're just jumping up and down.

1103
01:21:09,895 --> 01:21:14,758
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, we'll put Puppy on the spot since he dared to leave the show.

1104
01:21:16,019 --> 01:21:16,880
[SPEAKER_07]: Puppy, how was your week?

1105
01:21:16,900 --> 01:21:17,260
[SPEAKER_07]: How was your day?

1106
01:21:17,300 --> 01:21:17,901
[SPEAKER_07]: Traitor!

1107
01:21:18,821 --> 01:21:19,462
I need the other mic.

1108
01:21:20,983 --> 01:21:21,643
[SPEAKER_08]: Give me the other mic.

1109
01:21:23,625 --> 01:21:23,705
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

1110
01:21:23,745 --> 01:21:23,825
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

1111
01:21:25,915 --> 01:21:39,860
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, this week, I started classes, yay, and I spent most of my time playing this guy until I got Max 2, and then I spent all the time playing that.

1112
01:21:41,720 --> 01:21:44,021
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, and the occasional initial D binge, too.

1113
01:21:45,905 --> 01:21:58,408
[SPEAKER_08]: And then, uh, yesterday I went to Roseville to play F-Zero for, yes, for nine straight hours.

1114
01:22:00,068 --> 01:22:01,648
[SPEAKER_08]: Call me an addict, I don't care.

1115
01:22:03,009 --> 01:22:03,489
[SPEAKER_07]: It's true.

1116
01:22:03,509 --> 01:22:07,009
[SPEAKER_07]: Was the price down to four tokens by then?

1117
01:22:07,289 --> 01:22:07,770
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, it was.

1118
01:22:08,230 --> 01:22:10,630
[SPEAKER_07]: For the first two days, it was six tokens a game.

1119
01:22:11,370 --> 01:22:13,411
[SPEAKER_31]: And they also didn't have the real cars until Saturday.

1120
01:22:13,431 --> 01:22:13,531
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.

1121
01:22:17,898 --> 01:22:18,078
[SPEAKER_31]: Hmm.

1122
01:22:19,639 --> 01:22:20,839
[SPEAKER_31]: As I finish chewing my candy.

1123
01:22:20,959 --> 01:22:22,479
[SPEAKER_31]: Yeah, hello, you're on the radio, don't eat.

1124
01:22:22,880 --> 01:22:23,520
[SPEAKER_31]: Whatever.

1125
01:22:25,360 --> 01:22:27,061
[SPEAKER_31]: So I spent nine hours.

1126
01:22:28,861 --> 01:22:30,182
[SPEAKER_08]: I played 37 games.

1127
01:22:30,842 --> 01:22:31,222
[SPEAKER_08]: In a row?

1128
01:22:31,682 --> 01:22:31,842
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

1129
01:22:33,703 --> 01:22:34,603
[SPEAKER_08]: I knew that was coming.

1130
01:22:35,343 --> 01:22:35,984
[SPEAKER_08]: I had to.

1131
01:22:36,004 --> 01:22:38,504
[SPEAKER_08]: It was like the cursed number of the show.

1132
01:22:40,105 --> 01:22:40,565
[SPEAKER_08]: And then, uh...

1133
01:22:43,188 --> 01:22:53,273
[SPEAKER_08]: I started from scratch on a brand new card and worked my way all the way up to the highest rank possible as a master class license.

1134
01:22:53,934 --> 01:22:54,914
[SPEAKER_08]: I got all the way up to that.

1135
01:22:55,854 --> 01:23:01,537
[SPEAKER_31]: And I took all the records on five of the six tracks on Time Attack.

1136
01:23:01,997 --> 01:23:04,379
[SPEAKER_31]: And then, yeah.

1137
01:23:05,956 --> 01:23:14,322
[SPEAKER_31]: And then today I woke up at 1.30 and then sat in the apartment and then came here.

1138
01:23:15,643 --> 01:23:16,004
[SPEAKER_31]: Alright.

1139
01:23:16,824 --> 01:23:17,064
[SPEAKER_31]: Yeah.

1140
01:23:17,265 --> 01:23:19,246
[SPEAKER_31]: Anything else you want to share?

1141
01:23:20,207 --> 01:23:25,151
[SPEAKER_31]: Random non-stops have been keeping me up late at night because it's just ridiculously fun.

1142
01:23:26,191 --> 01:23:31,255
[SPEAKER_31]: Even though it screws you over with things like Subaru Dark Reverse Stealth.

1143
01:23:33,524 --> 01:23:38,927
[SPEAKER_07]: The one time we played it here on Wednesday when we were broadcasting, they got a really easy one.

1144
01:23:38,947 --> 01:23:40,288
[SPEAKER_07]: It was like all standard songs.

1145
01:23:40,308 --> 01:23:41,789
[SPEAKER_07]: It was stupid.

1146
01:23:41,849 --> 01:23:43,170
[SPEAKER_08]: You haven't played it enough then.

1147
01:23:43,650 --> 01:23:44,090
[SPEAKER_07]: Apparently.

1148
01:23:45,892 --> 01:23:46,232
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1149
01:23:46,492 --> 01:23:47,913
[SPEAKER_08]: Some really fucked up things.

1150
01:23:48,173 --> 01:23:50,294
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki, you have a second to tell us about your week and your day?

1151
01:23:50,314 --> 01:23:51,775
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1152
01:23:51,795 --> 01:23:52,055
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

1153
01:23:52,776 --> 01:23:53,616
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki, how was your week?

1154
01:23:53,636 --> 01:23:54,056
[SPEAKER_07]: How was your day?

1155
01:23:55,974 --> 01:23:57,735
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't do a whole lot.

1156
01:24:00,258 --> 01:24:17,655
[SPEAKER_07]: Stopped doing LiveWire because Thursday nights only four people are listening to me and I work on it for three hours and that's not a very good mix so I'm taking time off until I feel like doing it again and then it'll be Wednesdays.

1157
01:24:19,691 --> 01:24:26,756
[SPEAKER_07]: and then today I've been soldering and for some fucking reason in the last five minutes the solder gun does not want to melt the solder, period.

1158
01:24:27,357 --> 01:24:28,438
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm trying to clean the tip.

1159
01:24:29,338 --> 01:24:30,319
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I think that's what's wrong.

1160
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:38,265
[SPEAKER_07]: And, um... And, uh, let's see... Well, you know what?

1161
01:24:38,305 --> 01:24:41,087
[SPEAKER_07]: You should ditch your class to listen to my show, 23 Magus.

1162
01:24:41,287 --> 01:24:45,010
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't fucking mention shit if it's out of your control, dumbass.

1163
01:24:45,959 --> 01:24:52,084
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, if I wasn't dead with the computer and the modem, I wouldn't do it, too.

1164
01:24:52,504 --> 01:24:54,686
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, the whole world would listen to me, too, also.

1165
01:24:58,488 --> 01:24:58,889
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyways.

1166
01:25:03,573 --> 01:25:04,113
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, what else?

1167
01:25:04,693 --> 01:25:09,936
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, also, today I went and shopped and got some more controllers so I can work on my pads.

1168
01:25:09,976 --> 01:25:12,237
[SPEAKER_07]: I got all the wiring done on my pads, so that's kind of cool.

1169
01:25:12,897 --> 01:25:16,538
[SPEAKER_07]: And, um, they should be done hopefully next week, but I don't know.

1170
01:25:16,758 --> 01:25:18,599
[SPEAKER_07]: Because it's been going really slowly.

1171
01:25:19,400 --> 01:25:21,100
[SPEAKER_07]: And then, um, that's it.

1172
01:25:21,180 --> 01:25:21,480
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm done.

1173
01:25:22,321 --> 01:25:24,222
[SPEAKER_08]: Been doing much... Oh, went and played F-Zero.

1174
01:25:24,462 --> 01:25:25,142
[SPEAKER_08]: That was kind of neat.

1175
01:25:26,643 --> 01:25:27,143
[SPEAKER_08]: That was about it.

1176
01:25:30,130 --> 01:25:31,050
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm done.

1177
01:25:31,130 --> 01:25:31,470
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm done.

1178
01:25:34,891 --> 01:25:35,191
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

1179
01:25:35,771 --> 01:25:36,872
[SPEAKER_07]: I need to talk about my week of my day.

1180
01:25:36,912 --> 01:25:37,732
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't eat right now.

1181
01:25:38,932 --> 01:25:39,732
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, my week of my day.

1182
01:25:40,392 --> 01:25:41,373
[SPEAKER_07]: My week is pretty good.

1183
01:25:42,053 --> 01:25:43,553
[SPEAKER_07]: I saw a lot of movies this week.

1184
01:25:44,233 --> 01:25:49,875
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been hanging out with Joey who's been on the show the past couple weeks and he likes to watch a lot of movies at home so I've been catching up on all these movies I didn't see.

1185
01:25:49,895 --> 01:25:51,715
[SPEAKER_07]: I finally saw Resident Evil for the first time.

1186
01:25:52,915 --> 01:25:54,336
[SPEAKER_07]: Which is stupid.

1187
01:25:56,116 --> 01:26:01,099
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, though, on Thursday was when Roseville Golf Land finally got Max 2, and that made me as happy as a little girl.

1188
01:26:01,760 --> 01:26:02,060
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, please.

1189
01:26:03,961 --> 01:26:04,902
[SPEAKER_07]: Or not Max 2.

1190
01:26:04,982 --> 01:26:06,322
[SPEAKER_07]: What the hell am I talking about?

1191
01:26:07,423 --> 01:26:09,604
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm torn between food and making sense.

1192
01:26:10,045 --> 01:26:10,925
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean F-Zero.

1193
01:26:11,566 --> 01:26:15,348
[SPEAKER_07]: Golf Land got F-Zero, and I was so excited because I've been wanting to play F-Zero in the arcade for so long.

1194
01:26:15,728 --> 01:26:18,069
[SPEAKER_07]: And F-Zero in the arcade is awesome.

1195
01:26:18,370 --> 01:26:19,330
[SPEAKER_07]: It is so awesome.

1196
01:26:19,790 --> 01:26:21,652
[SPEAKER_07]: And I love how it links with the home version.

1197
01:26:21,672 --> 01:26:23,173
[SPEAKER_07]: You can practically unlock all of...

1198
01:26:24,173 --> 01:26:29,135
[SPEAKER_07]: Olive AX for your GX if you play enough in the arcade.

1199
01:26:29,575 --> 01:26:35,877
[SPEAKER_07]: So after playing F-Zero a lot, and I like to play it where you ride, too, where you go move with the thing when you put the seatbelt on.

1200
01:26:36,158 --> 01:26:40,619
[SPEAKER_07]: I only did that a couple times, but they have a motion machine at Roseville Golf Line, so it makes it more fun.

1201
01:26:40,819 --> 01:26:45,121
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't like doing the motion on the harder courses because it's ridiculous.

1202
01:26:45,561 --> 01:26:50,303
[SPEAKER_08]: Since the steering wheel itself doesn't move with the rest of the seat, it's ridiculously hard to steer.

1203
01:26:51,323 --> 01:26:52,404
[SPEAKER_07]: A little bit, yeah, that's true.

1204
01:26:54,326 --> 01:27:00,310
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't do it anymore, but it was fun the first couple times to go, Anyway, did you play all the courses?

1205
01:27:01,070 --> 01:27:01,651
[SPEAKER_07]: I haven't played them all.

1206
01:27:01,711 --> 01:27:04,393
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I've been trying to just play them in a race and try to unlock them.

1207
01:27:04,613 --> 01:27:06,194
[SPEAKER_07]: I love Aeropolis.

1208
01:27:06,374 --> 01:27:07,435
[SPEAKER_07]: I love the one on the home version.

1209
01:27:07,455 --> 01:27:09,376
[SPEAKER_07]: It's one of my favorite tracks, so I had to play that a lot.

1210
01:27:09,816 --> 01:27:11,478
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I've been playing the Outer Space one a little bit.

1211
01:27:11,498 --> 01:27:13,299
[SPEAKER_08]: Green Plant is fucking crazy.

1212
01:27:14,640 --> 01:27:14,740
Okay.

1213
01:27:15,400 --> 01:27:18,902
[SPEAKER_31]: Okay, the last course is fucking crazy, and it's like four minutes long.

1214
01:27:19,062 --> 01:27:20,603
[SPEAKER_31]: Yeah, it's only one lap, isn't it?

1215
01:27:20,803 --> 01:27:21,403
[SPEAKER_31]: It's three laps.

1216
01:27:22,044 --> 01:27:22,344
[SPEAKER_31]: Really?

1217
01:27:22,404 --> 01:27:22,624
[SPEAKER_31]: Dang.

1218
01:27:22,644 --> 01:27:27,727
[SPEAKER_31]: Yeah, it's like, the average race on that course is like four and a half minutes.

1219
01:27:27,747 --> 01:27:28,227
[SPEAKER_31]: That's cool.

1220
01:27:31,611 --> 01:27:33,172
[SPEAKER_07]: So, F-Zero was cool.

1221
01:27:33,252 --> 01:27:33,812
[SPEAKER_07]: And you know what?

1222
01:27:34,292 --> 01:27:55,181
[SPEAKER_07]: It got me to go to Rozo Golf Land, and when I was able to play there, it was a Thursday night, about 8 o'clock, so there weren't a lot of kids there, and it was nice and quiet, and DDR was so loud, because not a lot of games were going, and I got to play Conga Phelan on 4th Plus, and I got to blast the shit out of it, and I had so much fun playing DDR, and I haven't had that in a long time.

1223
01:27:55,261 --> 01:27:59,703
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I'm actually on good terms with Rozo Golf Land again, and I'm going to be going there more often.

1224
01:27:59,743 --> 01:28:00,443
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a revival!

1225
01:28:00,883 --> 01:28:01,584
[SPEAKER_07]: It's weird.

1226
01:28:02,085 --> 01:28:06,330
[SPEAKER_07]: I actually, I kind of want to bring back like how we used to go there once a week.

1227
01:28:06,650 --> 01:28:07,812
[SPEAKER_07]: I kind of want to bring that back.

1228
01:28:07,892 --> 01:28:08,893
[SPEAKER_07]: I just don't know when.

1229
01:28:10,114 --> 01:28:10,415
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

1230
01:28:11,161 --> 01:28:11,941
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe Thursday nights.

1231
01:28:12,282 --> 01:28:14,023
[SPEAKER_07]: And then you can warn the boss of 2DX.

1232
01:28:15,143 --> 01:28:17,865
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, actually, Scandia fixed their 2DX machine.

1233
01:28:17,905 --> 01:28:19,065
[SPEAKER_07]: Scandia fixed some of their stuff.

1234
01:28:19,205 --> 01:28:21,387
[SPEAKER_07]: So I kind of have to share time.

1235
01:28:21,427 --> 01:28:23,728
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, as of yesterday, 2DX still sucked.

1236
01:28:23,948 --> 01:28:24,228
[SPEAKER_08]: Really?

1237
01:28:25,349 --> 01:28:27,170
[SPEAKER_08]: I couldn't play right side very well.

1238
01:28:27,210 --> 01:28:33,293
[SPEAKER_31]: I failed Deadline Light 7 because the freaking keys stuck so much.

1239
01:28:35,839 --> 01:28:36,620
[SPEAKER_31]: It was ridiculous.

1240
01:28:38,121 --> 01:28:46,348
[SPEAKER_31]: And then I ended up playing Left Side Auto Scratch so I could just pass songs.

1241
01:28:47,069 --> 01:28:47,349
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1242
01:28:49,791 --> 01:28:52,153
[SPEAKER_07]: That's pretty much all I have to say about my day and my week.

1243
01:28:52,213 --> 01:28:55,776
[SPEAKER_07]: I think what we're going to do, we're going to take a break.

1244
01:28:57,088 --> 01:29:02,715
[SPEAKER_07]: And when we come back, we'll talk a little bit more and then we'll get into the cage match.

1275
01:35:20,518 --> 01:35:22,019
[SPEAKER_07]: One question that came up in the chat room.

1276
01:35:22,460 --> 01:35:22,840
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, what?

1277
01:35:23,160 --> 01:35:24,661
[SPEAKER_15]: How do you try to love somebody?

1278
01:35:24,921 --> 01:35:26,943
[SPEAKER_15]: Doesn't it just happen like diarrhea?

1279
01:35:29,565 --> 01:35:30,125
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe like...

1280
01:35:30,787 --> 01:35:31,128
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

1281
01:35:31,148 --> 01:35:32,273
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't even want to try and guess.

1282
01:35:32,293 --> 01:35:33,900
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't get that trying thing.

1283
01:35:33,940 --> 01:35:35,045
[SPEAKER_15]: You're just supposed to do it.

1284
01:35:36,176 --> 01:35:36,596
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what?

1285
01:35:36,616 --> 01:35:37,797
[SPEAKER_07]: Why don't you write Konami a letter?

1286
01:35:38,097 --> 01:35:39,457
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1287
01:35:39,518 --> 01:35:44,380
[SPEAKER_07]: We should all write one big letter to Konami about what we think they should do with DDR.

1288
01:35:44,800 --> 01:35:48,121
[SPEAKER_07]: Interesting question came up in the chat room, kind of going back to Max2USA.

1289
01:35:48,501 --> 01:35:49,842
[SPEAKER_07]: Favorite licensed song?

1290
01:35:50,422 --> 01:35:50,702
[SPEAKER_07]: Probably.

1291
01:35:51,923 --> 01:35:54,464
[SPEAKER_08]: Um... Licensed?

1292
01:35:54,544 --> 01:35:55,564
[SPEAKER_08]: Favorite licensed song?

1293
01:35:56,125 --> 01:35:58,666
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh... I'd have to say... No.

1294
01:35:59,346 --> 01:35:59,926
[SPEAKER_08]: Max2.

1295
01:36:00,907 --> 01:36:01,507
[SPEAKER_08]: Max2, yeah.

1296
01:36:01,747 --> 01:36:04,108
[SPEAKER_08]: Um... Actually, I'd have to say that, um...

1297
01:36:05,194 --> 01:36:06,895
[SPEAKER_08]: A little bit of ecstasy.

1298
01:36:07,816 --> 01:36:11,839
[SPEAKER_08]: I thought it would be very fun for the stubs, but they actually did a really good job with it.

1299
01:36:12,720 --> 01:36:16,963
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's like, the slowdown in it is like era, and it's like, whoa, shit, it's fun.

1300
01:36:20,145 --> 01:36:21,306
[SPEAKER_07]: ViolentHypergirl hasn't played it yet.

01:37:32,283 --> 01:37:34,404
[SPEAKER_22]: She even seems to agree with you.

1315
01:37:34,964 --> 01:37:35,604
[SPEAKER_07]: I love Will.

1316
01:37:35,664 --> 01:37:38,145
[SPEAKER_07]: I know I saw she even put it in the chat room, which is why I said it.

1317
01:37:39,325 --> 01:37:39,605
[SPEAKER_07]: I know.

1318
01:37:39,645 --> 01:37:39,905
[SPEAKER_07]: Why?

1319
01:37:39,925 --> 01:37:41,866
[SPEAKER_07]: Let them boobs.

1320
01:37:41,886 --> 01:37:42,586
[SPEAKER_07]: Let them boobs.

1321
01:37:42,646 --> 01:37:43,066
[SPEAKER_07]: Whatever.

1322
01:37:43,126 --> 01:37:43,646
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys are weird.

1323
01:37:45,167 --> 01:37:45,967
[SPEAKER_07]: Chat rooms are weird.

1324
01:37:46,687 --> 01:37:49,988
[SPEAKER_07]: www.callybomani.com It's no silent.

1325
01:37:50,028 --> 01:37:50,768
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course it's weird.

1326
01:37:52,189 --> 01:37:53,329
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to bring this up real fast.

1327
01:37:53,349 --> 01:37:55,270
[SPEAKER_07]: There's some interesting 2DX news that hit this week.

1328
01:37:55,290 --> 01:37:57,450
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys have been wondering where 2DX7 style is?

1329
01:37:58,210 --> 01:37:59,751
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you guys want to know when...

1330
01:38:00,600 --> 01:38:02,861
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you guys want to know when 2DX7Style is coming out?

1331
01:38:02,901 --> 01:38:04,581
[SPEAKER_07]: After you vote for it.

1332
01:38:05,701 --> 01:38:06,382
[SPEAKER_07]: This is the deal.

1333
01:38:06,562 --> 01:38:07,122
[SPEAKER_15]: And order it.

1334
01:38:07,902 --> 01:38:09,602
[SPEAKER_07]: But MontyStyle put out the news this week.

1335
01:38:09,642 --> 01:38:11,323
[SPEAKER_07]: Jamie, you want to run down by it?

1336
01:38:11,963 --> 01:38:13,323
[SPEAKER_15]: I glanced at it.

1337
01:38:13,463 --> 01:38:16,684
[SPEAKER_15]: I didn't bother translating the page yet because I'm just going to order it from Himaya.

1338
01:38:18,085 --> 01:38:25,707
[SPEAKER_15]: But there's a big voting poll, and if enough people vote, then they're going to put out another 2DX7Style.

1339
01:38:27,731 --> 01:38:30,152
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, and you know, I don't know if they're going to get enough.

1340
01:38:30,172 --> 01:38:33,194
[SPEAKER_22]: Isn't it supposed to be like 7th and 8th?

1341
01:38:33,214 --> 01:38:35,675
[SPEAKER_08]: Isn't it supposed to be something like 7th and 8th style mixed together?

1342
01:38:36,696 --> 01:38:37,356
[SPEAKER_15]: That's the rumor.

1343
01:38:37,776 --> 01:38:40,118
[SPEAKER_15]: But you know, I'm not horribly excited.

1344
01:38:40,998 --> 01:38:43,159
[SPEAKER_15]: Because I know that not enough people are going to vote for it.

1345
01:38:44,260 --> 01:38:44,900
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, I don't know.

1346
01:38:44,920 --> 01:38:48,122
[SPEAKER_15]: If enough people vote for it, then it'll be good.

1347
01:38:48,182 --> 01:38:50,603
[SPEAKER_15]: But I'm just going to order it from Himeya anyway.

1348
01:38:51,243 --> 01:38:54,285
[SPEAKER_15]: Because you already know about my trouble with Konami style.

1349
01:38:55,553 --> 01:38:57,474
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, you don't have the right kind of credit card.

1350
01:38:57,494 --> 01:38:59,575
[SPEAKER_15]: We're going to revoke your 2DX controller order.

1351
01:39:00,456 --> 01:39:00,996
[SPEAKER_15]: Bite me.

1352
01:39:03,577 --> 01:39:11,101
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what's interesting is that a lot of this came up because 2DX, they announced that they're going to make new controllers.

1353
01:39:11,682 --> 01:39:18,205
[SPEAKER_07]: And suddenly people went, wait a minute, Konami, why is Konami making new 2DX arcade style controllers if they haven't put out a home version forever?

1354
01:39:18,505 --> 01:39:23,668
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's kind of where this came about is that it was like, okay, now maybe since they're doing these controllers, they're going to do a new consumer style too.

1355
01:39:24,477 --> 01:39:30,141
[SPEAKER_15]: Now, with the new controllers, though, then I might have to toss down the $400 to order mine from Himea.

1356
01:39:30,161 --> 01:39:33,083
[SPEAKER_15]: Unless you want to make me one.

1357
01:39:34,844 --> 01:39:35,604
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll pay you to make me one.

1358
01:39:40,087 --> 01:39:49,033
[SPEAKER_07]: If you want to see the information on that, you can head on over to... I'm just going to tell you to go to BimaniStyle.com because they have the links there on their front page, which isn't loading for me right now.

1359
01:39:49,093 --> 01:39:49,513
[SPEAKER_07]: Bastards.

1360
01:39:50,094 --> 01:39:50,374
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, well.

1361
01:39:50,574 --> 01:39:53,616
[SPEAKER_07]: They have the links to Konami, the site that you'll need.

1362
01:39:55,538 --> 01:39:58,442
[SPEAKER_07]: So, how about a cage match, you guys?

1363
01:39:59,103 --> 01:39:59,443
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure.

1364
01:40:00,084 --> 01:40:00,405
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what?

1365
01:40:00,465 --> 01:40:01,346
[SPEAKER_07]: I hope it happens, though.

1366
01:40:01,386 --> 01:40:03,889
[SPEAKER_07]: I really want 7th Style at home.

1367
01:40:04,450 --> 01:40:05,952
[SPEAKER_07]: I want Beauty of Silence so bad.

1368
01:40:05,972 --> 01:40:12,841
[SPEAKER_07]: What makes me sad is that they'll probably cut all the licensed tracks if they're having to scrounge to do this, and that makes me a sad little panda.

1369
01:40:14,778 --> 01:40:18,340
[SPEAKER_07]: Where the fuck is my Dance Maniacs home version, you bastard?

1370
01:40:18,380 --> 01:40:19,941
[SPEAKER_15]: I just want to play Last Message at home.

1371
01:40:21,161 --> 01:40:23,283
[SPEAKER_15]: It's like one of the few seven stars I can pass.

1372
01:40:24,943 --> 01:40:27,585
[SPEAKER_15]: I can pass, like, Last Message.

1373
01:40:28,806 --> 01:40:30,747
[SPEAKER_15]: I can pass that and Monkey Dance.

1374
01:40:32,207 --> 01:40:35,449
[SPEAKER_15]: And, uh, what's the other seven I can pass, Rob?

1375
01:40:36,630 --> 01:40:37,310
[SPEAKER_15]: Please don't go.

1376
01:40:37,330 --> 01:40:39,451
[SPEAKER_31]: That's what I thought.

1377
01:40:39,871 --> 01:40:42,033
[SPEAKER_15]: Breaking my fingers working on Love Me Do, I gave up.

1378
01:40:44,642 --> 01:40:47,584
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh my god, my finger's bleeding!

1379
01:40:47,784 --> 01:40:50,166
[SPEAKER_14]: I cannot play the 2DX anymore!

1380
01:40:50,726 --> 01:40:52,528
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh my god, I am the sock!

1381
01:40:53,228 --> 01:40:54,389
[SPEAKER_14]: I have no arms!

1382
01:40:56,050 --> 01:40:57,511
[SPEAKER_15]: What was that movie that that was from?

1383
01:40:58,412 --> 01:40:59,333
[SPEAKER_15]: It was called The Kids.

1384
01:40:59,833 --> 01:41:03,376
[SPEAKER_15]: That movie sucked, but this isn't movie discussion, this is... Oh.

1385
01:41:05,017 --> 01:41:07,879
[SPEAKER_10]: In response to Nostalin, the Eurobeat song sucks.

1386
01:41:08,119 --> 01:41:09,220
[SPEAKER_10]: Why are you singing it?

1387
01:41:12,569 --> 01:41:13,569
[SPEAKER_15]: I like your Obeat.

1388
01:41:14,590 --> 01:41:21,532
[SPEAKER_15]: I like your... And you know, we need to do a shameless plug here for our forums that nobody goes to anymore.

1389
01:41:22,412 --> 01:41:22,892
[SPEAKER_05]: Agreed.

1390
01:41:25,373 --> 01:41:33,915
[SPEAKER_15]: The only thing that lives on the forums anymore is the quote thread, which is... I think the last thing that I saw in the quote thread was me trying to do chat para para.

1391
01:41:34,983 --> 01:41:35,563
[SPEAKER_07]: But you know what?

1392
01:41:36,063 --> 01:41:40,225
[SPEAKER_07]: If the forums don't work for you, at www.callybomani.com, click on forums.

1393
01:41:41,325 --> 01:41:44,846
[SPEAKER_07]: You can also visit our Orange Lounge Live Journal, where we post a lot of things.

1394
01:41:44,866 --> 01:41:49,328
[SPEAKER_07]: And we would like people to post more, so it's not just always Jamie announcing her show in the Live Journal.

1395
01:41:49,648 --> 01:41:52,369
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's username Orange Lounge, all one word on Live Journal.

1396
01:41:52,389 --> 01:41:52,669
[SPEAKER_15]: You know what?

1397
01:41:52,709 --> 01:41:54,089
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't even announce my show anymore.

1398
01:41:54,109 --> 01:41:55,390
[SPEAKER_07]: I get DarkSakura to do it.

1399
01:41:55,450 --> 01:41:57,311
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, so you get your minions to do it for you.

1400
01:41:57,711 --> 01:42:01,512
[SPEAKER_15]: My hordes of fans do my bidding.

1401
01:42:03,489 --> 01:42:05,193
[SPEAKER_15]: If that worked, I would do that all the time.

1402
01:42:08,041 --> 01:42:10,026
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, we're going to do the cage match.

1403
01:42:11,089 --> 01:42:11,991
[SPEAKER_07]: So last week...

1404
01:42:13,777 --> 01:42:14,818
[SPEAKER_07]: and New Orange Lounge Cage Match.

1405
01:42:14,858 --> 01:42:16,559
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I win because it went no better.

1406
01:42:17,079 --> 01:42:23,363
[SPEAKER_07]: The way the cage match works is that three songs get put in, you vote for your favorite, and it wins.

1407
01:42:23,704 --> 01:42:24,704
[SPEAKER_07]: Last week was interesting.

1408
01:42:24,744 --> 01:42:28,327
[SPEAKER_07]: Because of the Comcast problems, we weren't able to get enough voters from our chat room.

1409
01:42:28,687 --> 01:42:32,509
[SPEAKER_07]: So we combined their votes with in-house voting, which we haven't done in a long time.

1410
01:42:33,510 --> 01:42:36,512
[SPEAKER_07]: But we're going to go back to a strictly chat room vote tonight.

1411
01:42:36,552 --> 01:42:39,134
[SPEAKER_07]: So make sure if you want to vote in tonight's cage match, you're in our chat room.

1412
01:42:39,734 --> 01:42:42,716
[SPEAKER_07]: www.calibermoney.com, click on Orange Lounge and click on chat.

1413
01:42:43,097 --> 01:42:53,484
[SPEAKER_07]: Last week it came down to a tie between Loki's latest remix and Jamie's song, and I picked Jamie's song because I felt bad she hadn't won in a while, and I liked her song anyway.

1414
01:42:53,704 --> 01:42:54,805
[SPEAKER_07]: I got the pity vote.

1415
01:42:54,945 --> 01:42:55,665
[SPEAKER_07]: She got a pity vote.

1416
01:42:56,206 --> 01:42:56,366
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

1417
01:42:58,167 --> 01:42:59,187
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki's song didn't suck.

1418
01:42:59,207 --> 01:42:59,607
[SPEAKER_07]: Quit saying it.

1419
01:42:59,627 --> 01:43:00,448
[SPEAKER_14]: He says his song sucked.

1420
01:43:00,708 --> 01:43:01,208
[SPEAKER_07]: It didn't suck.

1421
01:43:01,628 --> 01:43:02,629
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, so here it is.

1422
01:43:02,689 --> 01:43:05,170
[SPEAKER_07]: Here's last week's winner and the first song you can vote for tonight.

1423
01:43:05,570 --> 01:43:08,492
[SPEAKER_07]: It's Free Fall featuring Jan Johnston, who I rather like.

1424
01:43:08,872 --> 01:43:10,753
[SPEAKER_07]: And this song is called Skydive.

1425
01:43:10,873 --> 01:43:11,273
[SPEAKER_07]: Enjoy.

1426
01:43:11,373 --> 01:43:14,475
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, we're only going to play a clip of it because it did win last week.

1427
01:43:14,575 --> 01:43:15,875
[SPEAKER_07]: So, here you go.

1428
01:43:17,016 --> 01:43:17,476
[SPEAKER_22]: Skydive

1429
01:43:20,066 --> 01:43:27,311
[SPEAKER_22]: All my favorites, my low end screams my name Take his hand, I'm afraid to run, run, run to you I'll be your one and only, one and only

1430
01:45:22,584 --> 01:45:24,266
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, that was last week's winner.

1431
01:45:26,669 --> 01:45:30,513
[SPEAKER_07]: Jan Johnston with the band Free Fall with a song called Skydive.

1432
01:45:31,014 --> 01:45:33,096
[SPEAKER_07]: Next up is Loki's pick.

1433
01:45:33,256 --> 01:45:34,517
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki, what did you pick for us tonight?

1434
01:45:35,118 --> 01:45:36,560
[SPEAKER_07]: Guess what came out this week?

1435
01:45:37,228 --> 01:45:39,390
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep, that's right, Ayumi Trance 3.

1436
01:45:39,771 --> 01:45:44,856
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, that's right, I picked another Ayumi Trance song because I'm lazy and I don't care.

1437
01:45:45,577 --> 01:45:50,002
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you get to listen to Naturally, the Whippinbird mix, because Naturally is pretty cool.

1438
01:45:51,263 --> 01:45:53,526
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, here it is, song number two in tonight's cage match.

1439
01:45:53,566 --> 01:45:56,970
[SPEAKER_07]: It's Ayumi Hamasaki from Cybertrance 3 with Naturally.

1440
01:45:57,110 --> 01:45:57,390
[SPEAKER_07]: Enjoy.

1441
01:46:07,429 --> 01:46:08,913
Thanks for watching!

1442
01:46:30,964 --> 01:46:31,905
Thank you for watching!

1443
01:48:02,236 --> 01:48:03,457
Thank you for watching!

1444
01:49:12,732 --> 01:49:13,733
Thank you for watching!

1445
01:50:35,155 --> 01:50:38,119
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, gang, that was song number two in tonight's cage match.

1446
01:50:38,359 --> 01:50:42,964
[SPEAKER_07]: New entry, Ayumi Hamasaki from Cybertrans 3 with Naturally, the Wittenberg mix.

1447
01:50:43,004 --> 01:50:45,767
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's go around, see what the room thought of it, starting off with Who's Got a Mic?

1448
01:50:46,562 --> 01:50:46,862
[SPEAKER_07]: Jamie.

1449
01:50:46,962 --> 01:50:48,303
[SPEAKER_15]: It's Transtastic.

1450
01:50:49,084 --> 01:50:49,244
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, 9.

1451
01:50:51,586 --> 01:50:52,106
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, Puppy.

1452
01:50:52,126 --> 01:50:57,950
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, it's cool because it's Ayumi, but I kind of like the original.

1453
01:50:57,970 --> 01:50:59,871
[SPEAKER_08]: I like the original naturally better, though.

1454
01:51:00,452 --> 01:51:01,252
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, but this is still good.

1455
01:51:01,272 --> 01:51:02,873
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll give it an 8.

1456
01:51:04,614 --> 01:51:04,995
[SPEAKER_07]: Alrighty.

1457
01:51:05,895 --> 01:51:07,116
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, ViolentHyperGirl.

1458
01:51:07,677 --> 01:51:09,338
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's cool just because I like Ayumi.

1459
01:51:10,635 --> 01:51:14,458
[SPEAKER_07]: And on a scale of 1 to 10, you give it a... Probably like a 7 or 8.

1460
01:51:15,338 --> 01:51:16,419
[SPEAKER_07]: 7 or 8, so 7 and a half.

1461
01:51:17,039 --> 01:51:17,360
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1462
01:51:17,400 --> 01:51:18,680
[SPEAKER_07]: You can do halves, it's acceptable.

1463
01:51:19,001 --> 01:51:20,742
[SPEAKER_07]: Yay, 7 and a half.

1464
01:51:20,982 --> 01:51:22,843
[SPEAKER_07]: Moving on, Bradley or Loki, whoever grabs the mic.

1465
01:51:22,863 --> 01:51:23,183
[SPEAKER_07]: Bradley.

1466
01:51:24,384 --> 01:51:25,045
[SPEAKER_07]: That's not pretty good.

1467
01:51:25,445 --> 01:51:25,985
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll give it a 9.

1468
01:51:26,606 --> 01:51:27,747
[SPEAKER_07]: Give it a 9.

1469
01:51:27,907 --> 01:51:29,768
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it was pretty rockin'.

1470
01:51:29,848 --> 01:51:32,250
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not my favorite song on the new Trance CD, but it's pretty good.

1471
01:51:32,270 --> 01:51:32,750
[SPEAKER_07]: 8 and a half.

1472
01:51:33,210 --> 01:51:33,470
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki.

1473
01:51:36,132 --> 01:51:40,215
[SPEAKER_07]: Motherfuckin' controller I slashed across the ground and that's bad.

1474
01:51:40,863 --> 01:51:50,565
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyways, I give it a... I don't give a crap because I picked it randomly out of the CD I downloaded, so... Yeah.

1475
01:51:51,665 --> 01:51:52,305
[SPEAKER_07]: I give it a 9.

1476
01:51:56,066 --> 01:51:52,305
9.

1477
01:51:56,486 --> 01:51:58,087
[SPEAKER_07]: I give the third sex a 10!

1478
01:51:59,227 --> 01:52:02,087
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, so there you have it, the votes for Yumi Hamasaki with Naturally.

1479
01:52:02,107 --> 01:52:04,208
[SPEAKER_07]: But remember, the ultimate decision is up to you.

1480
01:52:05,217 --> 01:52:08,901
[SPEAKER_07]: and head on over to our chat room, www.callybomani.com.

1481
01:52:09,141 --> 01:52:10,543
[SPEAKER_07]: Click on orange.

1482
01:52:10,803 --> 01:52:12,885
[SPEAKER_07]: Mental note, or you can write this down somewhere.

1483
01:52:13,986 --> 01:52:14,767
[SPEAKER_07]: Flash game.

1484
01:52:14,947 --> 01:52:16,569
[SPEAKER_07]: Ferret sex, the flash game.

1485
01:52:17,069 --> 01:52:18,050
[SPEAKER_07]: When the website comes up.

1486
01:52:18,110 --> 01:52:18,711
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll work on that.

1487
01:52:18,751 --> 01:52:22,174
[SPEAKER_07]: When we get our other website up, which we've been needing to do for a month.

1488
01:52:22,414 --> 01:52:25,377
[SPEAKER_07]: Or even just like an animated gif or something.

1489
01:52:26,138 --> 01:52:26,719
[SPEAKER_07]: What, puppy?

1490
01:52:28,100 --> 01:52:28,881
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not going to do that.

1491
01:52:29,229 --> 01:52:37,473
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, next up is my pick, and I've got, I assure you, what will go down in history, it's a Rob Classic pick tonight.

1492
01:52:38,193 --> 01:52:47,257
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I'm afraid, I asked, now, don't blame me, because I asked the room, do you want my pick tonight to be something trance, or something booty and foul?

1493
01:52:47,617 --> 01:52:51,398
[SPEAKER_07]: And they picked booty and foul, so, this is the song you get.

1494
01:52:51,859 --> 01:52:57,001
[SPEAKER_07]: But this is something, if my baby mama can make solo bass, I think this song can make solo bass.

1495
01:52:57,461 --> 01:52:58,823
[SPEAKER_07]: So this is my pick for tonight.

1496
01:52:59,424 --> 01:53:01,847
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a group call, and I have to thank the Ice Queen.

1497
01:53:02,689 --> 01:53:03,810
[SPEAKER_07]: He recommended this one to me.

1498
01:53:03,890 --> 01:53:05,092
[SPEAKER_07]: Ice Queen recommended me to this one.

1499
01:53:05,613 --> 01:53:08,717
[SPEAKER_07]: This is Fanny Pack with a song called Camel Toe.

1500
01:53:09,538 --> 01:53:10,419
[SPEAKER_07]: Camel Toe.

1501
01:53:10,580 --> 01:53:11,180
[SPEAKER_07]: Camel Toe.

1502
01:53:11,301 --> 01:53:11,641
[SPEAKER_07]: Enjoy.

1503
01:53:12,262 --> 01:53:14,165
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm... Yes, these are my cups.

1504
01:53:48,285 --> 01:53:48,845
[SPEAKER_17]: Outro Music

1505
01:56:20,937 --> 01:56:23,201
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, that was the last song in tonight's cage match.

1506
01:56:23,281 --> 01:56:25,926
[SPEAKER_07]: My pick, Fanny Pack with Camel Toe.

1507
01:56:26,026 --> 01:56:27,829
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you Ice Queen for picking that one out for me.

1508
01:56:28,290 --> 01:56:28,631
[SPEAKER_07]: Jamie!

1509
01:56:29,542 --> 01:56:31,203
[SPEAKER_15]: That was so ghetto booty.

1510
01:56:31,603 --> 01:56:32,544
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh my god, Rob.

1511
01:56:33,845 --> 01:56:36,186
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright, you need to be spanked for that song.

1512
01:56:37,828 --> 01:56:38,588
[SPEAKER_15]: Not by me, though.

1513
01:56:38,648 --> 01:56:41,230
[SPEAKER_15]: We'll talk to somebody who's not here tonight.

1514
01:56:42,130 --> 01:56:42,391
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1515
01:56:43,011 --> 01:56:43,871
[SPEAKER_07]: On a scale of 1 to 10?

1516
01:56:46,393 --> 01:56:48,374
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't think that numbers can quantify it.

1517
01:56:49,295 --> 01:56:51,256
[SPEAKER_15]: It gets a B for booty.

1518
01:56:51,977 --> 01:56:52,317
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

1519
01:56:52,337 --> 01:56:53,878
[SPEAKER_15]: So I guess it translates to an 8.

1520
01:56:54,458 --> 01:56:54,919
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, Erin.

1521
01:56:54,939 --> 01:56:55,039
[SPEAKER_07]: Erin.

1522
01:56:56,849 --> 01:56:57,289
[SPEAKER_10]: 8 for good laughs.

1523
01:56:57,309 --> 01:56:57,469
[SPEAKER_10]: Puppies!

1524
01:57:22,992 --> 01:57:28,513
[SPEAKER_08]: Just the fact that the name of the song is Camel Toad is ridiculous in itself.

1525
01:57:29,694 --> 01:57:30,554
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, come on.

1526
01:57:31,254 --> 01:57:31,874
[SPEAKER_08]: What next?

1527
01:57:33,655 --> 01:57:36,555
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, next thing you know, there's going to be a song called Blue Balls.

1528
01:57:39,136 --> 01:57:40,096
[SPEAKER_07]: There may well be.

1529
01:57:41,176 --> 01:57:42,597
[SPEAKER_07]: Jamie's threatening to write it right now.

1530
01:57:43,597 --> 01:57:45,077
[SPEAKER_07]: It'll be the next Politary song.

1531
01:57:45,157 --> 01:57:47,018
[SPEAKER_07]: The next remix I make will be...

1532
01:57:47,831 --> 01:57:48,892
[SPEAKER_07]: Insert song name here.

1533
01:57:49,213 --> 01:57:50,374
[SPEAKER_07]: The Blues Balls Mix.

1534
01:57:50,474 --> 01:57:50,714
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1535
01:57:51,355 --> 01:57:53,296
[SPEAKER_07]: Ooh, it'd be even better if it was a blues song.

1536
01:57:53,857 --> 01:57:55,018
[SPEAKER_07]: Let Puppy finish his thought.

1537
01:57:56,199 --> 01:57:57,280
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a thought?

1538
01:57:59,583 --> 01:58:00,323
[SPEAKER_08]: He has to give a number.

1539
01:58:00,363 --> 01:58:02,926
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't know I would... 3.159.

1540
01:58:04,147 --> 01:58:04,567
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright.

1541
01:58:05,368 --> 01:58:05,809
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, Bradley.

1542
01:58:06,209 --> 01:58:06,690
[SPEAKER_08]: Just because.

1543
01:58:06,710 --> 01:58:08,852
[SPEAKER_08]: Just because.

1544
01:58:09,472 --> 01:58:09,973
[SPEAKER_08]: Just because.

1545
01:58:12,575 --> 01:58:13,515
[SPEAKER_05]: Best song ever, 10, Loki.

1546
01:58:34,197 --> 01:58:44,101
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, yeah, you know, the white in me says seven, but the ghetto black in me says ten.

1547
01:58:45,521 --> 01:58:46,662
[SPEAKER_07]: So what's that average, too?

1548
01:58:46,822 --> 01:58:47,462
[SPEAKER_07]: Nine point nine?

1549
01:58:47,482 --> 01:58:54,565
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, er, nine, wait, nine and a half.

1550
01:58:55,465 --> 01:58:55,785
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1551
01:58:57,637 --> 01:58:58,577
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, here we go.

1552
01:58:58,657 --> 01:58:59,777
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's recap.

1553
01:59:00,678 --> 01:59:04,298
[SPEAKER_07]: For those of you that haven't voted before, you have to send a private message to me in the chat room.

1554
01:59:04,318 --> 01:59:06,619
[SPEAKER_07]: You have to send it over private message or it doesn't count.

1555
01:59:06,659 --> 01:59:08,219
[SPEAKER_07]: If you say it publicly in the room, it doesn't count.

1556
01:59:08,619 --> 01:59:14,621
[SPEAKER_07]: And I know we have some new chatters in there tonight, so I'll type out how you do that for those of you that don't know.

1557
01:59:14,981 --> 01:59:17,041
[SPEAKER_07]: And sorry, but you can't vote for Holic.

1558
01:59:17,241 --> 01:59:20,682
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, let's recap, shall we, real fast.

1559
01:59:20,822 --> 01:59:24,783
[SPEAKER_07]: Song number one, last week's winner, Free Fall featuring Janz Johnston with Skydive.

1560
01:59:34,269 --> 01:59:40,053
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, song number two that you can vote for tonight is Yumi Hamasaki from Cybertrans 3 with a song called Naturally.

1561
01:59:50,285 --> 02:00:03,609
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, and song number three you can vote for tonight is a band called Fanny Pack with the song Camel Toe.

1562
02:00:04,069 --> 02:00:04,389
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

1563
02:00:04,710 --> 02:00:06,210
[SPEAKER_07]: Hmm, I wonder what's gonna win.

1564
02:00:06,510 --> 02:00:07,931
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, vote now.

1565
02:00:08,051 --> 02:00:09,551
[SPEAKER_07]: Place vote now!

1566
02:00:13,612 --> 02:00:16,293
[SPEAKER_07]: In the meantime, Loki, why don't you tell us what's going on in the sim world?

1567
02:00:19,830 --> 02:00:22,715
[SPEAKER_07]: Damn piece of wire doesn't want to go through my hole.

1568
02:00:23,216 --> 02:00:24,959
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyways, in the controller.

1569
02:00:25,200 --> 02:00:25,921
[SPEAKER_07]: Hole in the controller.

1570
02:00:27,298 --> 02:00:39,402
[SPEAKER_07]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1571
02:00:57,606 --> 02:00:59,648
[SPEAKER_07]: Asian, I kid you not, Asian mix.

1572
02:00:59,808 --> 02:01:02,551
[SPEAKER_07]: All the music in it must be sung by an Asian singer.

1573
02:01:03,031 --> 02:01:07,715
[SPEAKER_07]: So it has to be, you know, in, you know, Japanese or, you know, Chinese, Korean.

1574
02:01:10,037 --> 02:01:17,163
[SPEAKER_07]: It's, it's, it's trying to, um, they're trying to basically spark interest for Turning Mix 5.

1575
02:01:17,524 --> 02:01:22,668
[SPEAKER_07]: So basically this is going to be the, this is going to be the poorly run, um, Stepchild that's in the middle.

1576
02:01:22,988 --> 02:01:23,169
[SPEAKER_07]: So...

1577
02:01:25,612 --> 02:01:41,937
[SPEAKER_10]: For this Asian mix, it better be really, really good Japanese or Korean songs, because we all know where Chinese pop went, or is going, and, you know... But it seems like, judging from the last remix, a lot of people don't have that good a song taste.

1578
02:01:44,618 --> 02:01:48,459
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, technically, you can have Russian music, too, because part of Russia is in Asia.

1579
02:01:49,140 --> 02:01:49,820
[SPEAKER_15]: So we can have Tattoo!

1580
02:01:55,526 --> 02:02:06,091
[SPEAKER_10]: But yeah, and obviously, the only good, honestly the only good Chinese songs there are, are basically slow songs and some trance slash techno, but not much.

1581
02:02:07,791 --> 02:02:10,372
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, I haven't listened to Tide Pops though, not very much.

1582
02:02:13,033 --> 02:02:17,155
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, India's in Asia too, so Dollar Mendy all around.

1583
02:02:17,735 --> 02:02:21,117
[SPEAKER_10]: Tunak, Tunak, Tunak.

1584
02:02:22,680 --> 02:02:24,660
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, get over Tunak Tunak already.

1585
02:02:24,701 --> 02:02:25,221
[SPEAKER_07]: Come on.

1586
02:02:25,281 --> 02:02:26,921
[SPEAKER_07]: That song is fucking used.

1587
02:02:27,241 --> 02:02:27,921
[SPEAKER_07]: It's done.

1588
02:02:30,042 --> 02:02:32,662
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, hello and welcome to a joke that is fucking moldy.

1589
02:02:32,802 --> 02:02:33,783
[SPEAKER_07]: It's done.

1590
02:02:34,363 --> 02:02:35,523
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sick of Tunak Tunak.

1591
02:02:38,584 --> 02:02:38,904
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1592
02:02:39,404 --> 02:02:44,125
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's play Magic the Gathering and listen to our, you know, Lilith Fair music while we, you know...

1593
02:02:44,961 --> 02:02:46,182
[SPEAKER_07]: You mean Dungeons and Dragons?

1594
02:03:09,990 --> 02:03:12,831
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, what useless songs are going to come out of this?

1595
02:03:13,071 --> 02:03:14,192
[SPEAKER_07]: Honestly, it's horrid.

1596
02:03:15,092 --> 02:03:15,332
[SPEAKER_07]: I know.

1597
02:03:15,532 --> 02:03:17,613
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to see a gazillion Ayumi songs.

1598
02:03:17,673 --> 02:03:25,016
[SPEAKER_07]: And if you think I'm going to jump off my ass to make you your stupid Max 2 USA license tracks, think again.

1599
02:03:25,216 --> 02:03:30,198
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't care because I haven't played Step Mania in three months and I am not going to make your stupid tracks.

1600
02:03:30,598 --> 02:03:34,860
[SPEAKER_07]: So you're going to have to wait for DDRUK to make them because they're good at everything.

1601
02:03:36,360 --> 02:03:38,421
[SPEAKER_06]: Even though I made them the last two times and they took credit.

1602
02:03:39,212 --> 02:03:42,233
[SPEAKER_06]: to a credit because they said, oh, they were out of sync.

1603
02:03:43,053 --> 02:03:44,054
[SPEAKER_06]: You're out of sync.

1604
02:03:44,934 --> 02:03:45,254
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm done.

1605
02:03:48,655 --> 02:03:49,875
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not just that Yumi songs.

1606
02:03:49,895 --> 02:03:54,377
[SPEAKER_10]: There's probably going to be a lot of stupid Pop Finkel, SES, Shinhwa songs.

1607
02:03:55,477 --> 02:03:57,238
[SPEAKER_07]: Last call for cage match votes in the chat room.

1608
02:03:57,958 --> 02:03:59,118
[SPEAKER_15]: I have a challenge to issue.

1609
02:03:59,338 --> 02:03:59,558
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1610
02:03:59,718 --> 02:04:02,439
[SPEAKER_15]: I want Dragon Ash or Malice Miser.

1611
02:04:02,879 --> 02:04:07,461
[SPEAKER_15]: I would love to see some visual K done or...

1612
02:04:08,602 --> 02:04:13,707
[SPEAKER_15]: I would love to see just some good, you know, uber goth J-rock make it into the turning mix.

1613
02:04:14,528 --> 02:04:15,629
[SPEAKER_15]: See how they pull that off.

1614
02:04:18,111 --> 02:04:21,074
[SPEAKER_15]: Like, you know, have like the Beast of Blood video playing in the background or something.

1615
02:04:27,681 --> 02:04:28,762
[SPEAKER_08]: What am I going to do with it?

1616
02:04:29,803 --> 02:04:30,223
[SPEAKER_08]: Like this?

1617
02:04:30,243 --> 02:04:30,764
[SPEAKER_08]: Like this?

1618
02:04:36,139 --> 02:04:36,539
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1619
02:04:37,859 --> 02:04:40,459
[SPEAKER_07]: Would you guys like to hear who got the cage match tonight?

1620
02:04:40,519 --> 02:04:41,820
[SPEAKER_07]: Because we have collected all the votes.

1621
02:04:42,020 --> 02:04:42,780
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1622
02:04:42,900 --> 02:04:43,240
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow.

1623
02:04:43,920 --> 02:04:51,522
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I just try to wrap it up quick now because we tend to do FUs in cage match back-to-back, and I have to close out all the private messages for FUs as if you needed to know that.

1624
02:04:51,582 --> 02:04:53,222
[SPEAKER_07]: So here we go.

1625
02:04:53,262 --> 02:04:54,322
[SPEAKER_07]: I haven't gotten any more votes.

1626
02:04:54,382 --> 02:04:55,943
[SPEAKER_07]: So here is tonight's winner.

1627
02:04:55,963 --> 02:04:57,083
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys ready for it?

1628
02:04:57,103 --> 02:04:57,163
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1629
02:04:58,383 --> 02:05:01,166
[SPEAKER_07]: It is a tie.

1630
02:05:01,707 --> 02:05:04,409
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, lovely.

1631
02:05:05,570 --> 02:05:11,616
[SPEAKER_07]: No, the way the rules go is that the host whose song did not tie will break the tie.

1632
02:05:12,237 --> 02:05:20,966
[SPEAKER_07]: And tonight, song one, song one that tied was Camel Toe.

1633
02:05:21,626 --> 02:05:22,027
[SPEAKER_07]: Figures.

1634
02:05:23,777 --> 02:05:29,900
[SPEAKER_07]: Song number two that tied tonight was... If the damn thing will play.

1635
02:05:30,080 --> 02:05:30,920
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me guess, a Yumi?

1636
02:05:31,140 --> 02:05:32,701
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, it was a Yumi.

1637
02:05:32,821 --> 02:05:36,243
[SPEAKER_07]: So it means... So it goes, Jamie gets to break the tie.

1638
02:05:36,623 --> 02:05:39,844
[SPEAKER_07]: And she gets to break the tie, and hopefully she remembers the favor I gave her last week.

1639
02:05:42,326 --> 02:05:43,766
[SPEAKER_07]: But not to influence her vote or anything.

1640
02:05:44,627 --> 02:05:45,227
[SPEAKER_15]: Give it to the butt.

1641
02:05:46,307 --> 02:05:46,908
[SPEAKER_07]: Give it to Camel Toe?

1642
02:05:46,928 --> 02:05:47,988
[SPEAKER_07]: Give it to the booty.

1643
02:05:48,428 --> 02:05:51,590
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, Camel Toe is this week's cage match winner.

1644
02:05:57,808 --> 02:06:00,410
[SPEAKER_07]: So, Camel Toe wins by a vote of one.

1645
02:06:00,490 --> 02:06:01,491
[SPEAKER_07]: I also call.

1646
02:06:01,511 --> 02:06:01,631
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

1647
02:06:02,052 --> 02:06:04,093
[SPEAKER_15]: That be the FU music for the chat room.

1648
02:06:05,635 --> 02:06:07,756
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, that will be the FU music for the chat room tonight.

1649
02:06:07,796 --> 02:06:08,157
[SPEAKER_07]: That's fine.

1650
02:06:10,143 --> 02:06:17,286
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, if you want to visit our webcam, www.callybomondi.com, click on Orange Lounge and click on Chat.

1651
02:06:17,666 --> 02:06:30,471
[SPEAKER_07]: The site you can see on the cam right now is Puppy hunched over with a microphone, Loki soldering in the background, Aaron has been on and off the cam, and Jamie hides from the cam, so she randomly holds objects up.

1652
02:06:32,361 --> 02:06:35,962
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, guess what's coming up when we take this break, kids?

1653
02:06:36,482 --> 02:06:37,083
[SPEAKER_07]: After this break.

1654
02:06:38,603 --> 02:06:39,683
[SPEAKER_07]: Come on, we do it every week.

1655
02:06:41,144 --> 02:06:41,644
[SPEAKER_07]: FUs.

1656
02:06:42,144 --> 02:06:42,924
[SPEAKER_07]: We all know it.

1657
02:06:42,964 --> 02:06:43,805
[SPEAKER_07]: Why do we have to guess?

1658
02:06:44,005 --> 02:06:45,385
[SPEAKER_07]: Because it's the fun part.

1659
02:06:45,425 --> 02:06:45,705
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

1660
02:06:47,326 --> 02:06:47,866
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, Jamie?

1661
02:06:48,286 --> 02:06:50,267
[SPEAKER_15]: I have a microphone now, so just play my damn music.

1662
02:06:50,347 --> 02:06:51,347
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, we're not doing any FUs yet.

1663
02:06:51,367 --> 02:06:52,088
[SPEAKER_07]: We're taking a break first.

1664
02:06:52,448 --> 02:06:52,888
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't care.

1665
02:06:53,468 --> 02:06:53,789
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

1666
02:06:55,169 --> 02:06:59,651
[SPEAKER_07]: In this break, we're going to hear more Max 2 USA music, and this is a lot of... You know what?

1667
02:06:59,751 --> 02:06:59,951
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

1668
02:07:00,331 --> 02:07:02,573
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't understand why they don't just let me pick all the music.

1669
02:07:03,453 --> 02:07:03,793
[SPEAKER_07]: What do you mean?

1670
02:07:03,813 --> 02:07:04,433
[SPEAKER_07]: For Max 2?

1671
02:07:05,114 --> 02:07:05,294
[SPEAKER_15]: No.

1672
02:07:05,314 --> 02:07:06,554
[SPEAKER_15]: I meant, like, in general.

1673
02:07:07,275 --> 02:07:10,116
[SPEAKER_15]: I should, like, petition Konami to let me pick everything.

1674
02:07:12,984 --> 02:07:17,566
[SPEAKER_15]: The only thing that some of those songs are good for being picked for is, like, picking noses.

1675
02:07:18,166 --> 02:07:19,266
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know.

1676
02:07:19,446 --> 02:07:21,027
[SPEAKER_15]: They're all really good songs, though, so go ahead and play them.

1677
02:07:21,767 --> 02:07:22,047
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1678
02:07:22,407 --> 02:07:22,847
[SPEAKER_07]: Here we go.

1679
02:07:23,207 --> 02:07:25,548
[SPEAKER_07]: In this break, you're going to hear a lot of songs that were requested.

1680
02:07:25,608 --> 02:07:32,751
[SPEAKER_07]: Tomorrow, Perfume in this break, Will I, and SFMP with Try To Love You.

1681
02:07:33,031 --> 02:07:34,411
[SPEAKER_07]: You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

1682
02:07:34,451 --> 02:07:35,812
[SPEAKER_07]: Tell a friend we're on the air.

1683
02:07:36,872 --> 02:07:38,753
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll be back after this.

1684

02:09:39,110 --> 02:09:39,771
[SPEAKER_24]: Thanks for watching!

1688
02:10:34,795 --> 02:10:39,159
[SPEAKER_20]: Will I ever love you again?

1689
02:10:41,621 --> 02:10:45,965
[SPEAKER_22]: Will we be together again?

1690
02:10:48,428 --> 02:10:52,492
[SPEAKER_22]: Thought the love we had was strong

1691
02:10:54,407 --> 02:10:59,970
[SPEAKER_22]: Tell me what's wrong What did we go wrong?

1692
02:11:59,962 --> 02:12:07,665
[SPEAKER_22]: No, no, nobody's love, no, nobody's love, no, nobody's love, yeah, baby, love

1693
02:12:35,457 --> 02:12:46,279
[SPEAKER_22]: Bitch, get a new song.

1694
02:12:46,919 --> 02:12:49,380
[SPEAKER_27]: An open letter from Orange Lounge Radio.

1695
02:12:49,540 --> 02:12:53,581
[SPEAKER_07]: Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio episode number 62 in progress.

1696
02:12:54,321 --> 02:12:56,301
[SPEAKER_07]: And Jamie, do you know what time it is?

1697
02:12:57,682 --> 02:12:58,122
[SPEAKER_13]: Fuck you.

1698
02:12:59,122 --> 02:13:01,562
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, I don't have the music queued up yet.

1699
02:13:01,943 --> 02:13:04,083
[SPEAKER_07]: You're supposed to take longer than that to answer the question.

1700
02:13:05,453 --> 02:13:07,754
[SPEAKER_15]: It's time for me to throw a ferret at puppy.

1701
02:13:08,174 --> 02:13:08,474
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

1702
02:13:09,554 --> 02:13:10,434
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, now I'm ready.

1703
02:13:11,134 --> 02:13:12,135
[SPEAKER_07]: Jamie, what time is it?

1704
02:13:12,215 --> 02:13:12,735
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't care.

1705
02:13:13,135 --> 02:13:13,755
[SPEAKER_07]: Come on.

1706
02:13:14,255 --> 02:13:15,015
[SPEAKER_15]: Uh-uh, you're no fun.

1707
02:13:15,035 --> 02:13:15,555
[SPEAKER_15]: You weren't ready.

1708
02:13:17,076 --> 02:13:17,696
[SPEAKER_07]: Jamie.

1709
02:13:18,876 --> 02:13:22,117
[SPEAKER_15]: It's time for me to get a ferret thrown at my hand.

1710
02:13:22,597 --> 02:13:23,737
[SPEAKER_15]: Stop throwing ferrets at me!

1711
02:13:28,124 --> 02:13:32,005
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't really had that bad of a week, but... Okay, stop that.

1712
02:13:57,765 --> 02:14:01,968
[SPEAKER_13]: First off, a big F you goes to Puppy for throwing a ferret at my boob.

1713
02:14:03,649 --> 02:14:07,212
[SPEAKER_13]: And for throwing a ferret at ViolentHyperGirl's ass.

1714
02:14:09,834 --> 02:14:10,955
[SPEAKER_13]: But you were the target.

1715
02:14:11,695 --> 02:14:12,736
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's your fault.

1716
02:14:13,897 --> 02:14:17,239
[SPEAKER_13]: It's your fault for... Stop it.

1717
02:14:17,579 --> 02:14:17,900
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

1718
02:14:19,121 --> 02:14:21,742
[SPEAKER_15]: Another one goes for the rice I was cooking for being too wet.

1719
02:14:23,083 --> 02:14:25,025
[SPEAKER_13]: That's my fault because I put in too much water.

1720
02:14:26,395 --> 02:14:30,957
[SPEAKER_15]: I can't help it, you know, the rice was just so hot.

1721
02:14:32,377 --> 02:14:35,698
[SPEAKER_15]: And it couldn't help being moist, you know, because I was touching it.

1722
02:14:38,579 --> 02:14:41,660
[SPEAKER_15]: I was rolling it around and making balls with it.

1723
02:14:43,780 --> 02:14:48,802
[SPEAKER_15]: Anyway, another F you goes to being hot, because I am right now.

1724
02:14:52,059 --> 02:14:55,461
[SPEAKER_15]: Another one goes toward my laundry for not being dry, so I'm drying it again.

1725
02:14:56,882 --> 02:15:01,844
[SPEAKER_15]: Another F you goes toward ferret sex.

1726
02:15:05,066 --> 02:15:09,488
[SPEAKER_15]: Another F you goes toward all the people who are not signed up for my message board.

1727
02:15:13,350 --> 02:15:14,770
[SPEAKER_15]: It's roleplay.darksakura.com

1728
02:15:20,971 --> 02:15:26,016
[SPEAKER_15]: I think I'm going to throw on there, by the way, a sexual roleplay.

1729
02:15:26,596 --> 02:15:29,499
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm going to make it hidden for all of you people who are into the kinky crap.

1730
02:15:31,120 --> 02:15:34,083
[SPEAKER_15]: There's going to be one for tops and one for bottoms.

1731
02:15:34,483 --> 02:15:36,044
[SPEAKER_15]: And then the sadomasochism.

1732
02:15:36,565 --> 02:15:37,546
[SPEAKER_15]: We'll throw that in there, too.

1733
02:15:37,606 --> 02:15:37,866
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

1734
02:15:37,966 --> 02:15:38,647
[SPEAKER_07]: Sounds like fun.

1735
02:15:38,687 --> 02:15:39,427
[SPEAKER_15]: It's forthcoming.

1736
02:15:40,188 --> 02:15:43,311
[SPEAKER_15]: Other than that, I'm really... Oh, yeah.

1737
02:15:43,991 --> 02:15:45,633
[SPEAKER_15]: Fuck the sheriff who was...

1738
02:15:46,351 --> 02:15:48,172
[SPEAKER_15]: Freaking following me and tailgating me.

1739
02:15:48,432 --> 02:15:49,193
[SPEAKER_15]: And then it passed me.

1740
02:15:49,813 --> 02:15:50,834
[SPEAKER_15]: And I was going to speed limit.

1741
02:15:51,014 --> 02:15:53,676
[SPEAKER_15]: I freaking hate the double standard.

1742
02:15:54,897 --> 02:15:57,078
[SPEAKER_15]: And then the tow truck.

1743
02:15:57,138 --> 02:15:58,599
[SPEAKER_15]: It's not one of those typical tow trucks.

1744
02:15:58,619 --> 02:16:00,060
[SPEAKER_15]: This is one of the ones with the flatbed.

1745
02:16:00,080 --> 02:16:02,762
[SPEAKER_15]: It's like huger than God truck.

1746
02:16:03,603 --> 02:16:05,724
[SPEAKER_15]: And it was right on my ass the whole time here.

1747
02:16:06,104 --> 02:16:07,325
[SPEAKER_15]: I was like, okay, you need to get off.

1748
02:16:07,886 --> 02:16:08,886
[SPEAKER_15]: You are not a hemorrhoid.

1749
02:16:09,167 --> 02:16:09,867
[SPEAKER_15]: I am too young.

1750
02:16:10,607 --> 02:16:10,928
[SPEAKER_15]: You know.

1751
02:16:13,349 --> 02:16:13,970
[SPEAKER_15]: And then, um...

1752
02:16:16,408 --> 02:16:17,609
[SPEAKER_15]: Really, I think that's about it.

1753
02:16:18,629 --> 02:16:22,431
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh yeah, a big FU goes to my sleep pattern, which is going to hopefully be corrected.

1754
02:16:23,311 --> 02:16:24,852
[SPEAKER_15]: And I got a really cool hat.

1755
02:16:25,172 --> 02:16:25,592
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, bye.

1756
02:16:26,772 --> 02:16:28,773
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, next up is Loki.

1757
02:16:33,035 --> 02:16:36,016
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, anyways, I think I'm wrapped around you here.

1758
02:16:36,696 --> 02:16:36,956
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1759
02:16:38,877 --> 02:16:41,338
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I'm trying to get to my first FU here.

1760
02:16:41,718 --> 02:16:43,559
[SPEAKER_07]: I just have to find something.

1761
02:16:45,160 --> 02:16:45,480
[SPEAKER_07]: There it is.

1762
02:16:46,235 --> 02:16:48,917
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, can you turn down the music, like, off?

1763
02:16:49,697 --> 02:16:54,440
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, first FU of the week goes to Konami, okay?

1764
02:16:55,801 --> 02:16:58,202
[SPEAKER_07]: Mainly the group System SF.

1765
02:16:58,522 --> 02:17:03,445
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know who the fuck you think you are, but I don't like you blatantly ripping off other songs.

1766
02:17:04,126 --> 02:17:04,866
[SPEAKER_07]: Really, I don't.

1767
02:17:05,267 --> 02:17:07,368
[SPEAKER_07]: This piracy stuff has to stop.

1768
02:17:07,948 --> 02:17:11,330
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, this song I'm going to play for you is by another group.

1769
02:17:13,155 --> 02:17:16,556
[SPEAKER_07]: with a very similar name to System SF.

1770
02:17:16,676 --> 02:17:20,016
[SPEAKER_07]: It's called System F. They predated you by five years.

1771
02:17:20,517 --> 02:17:21,517
[SPEAKER_07]: So here's their song.

1772
02:17:21,897 --> 02:17:25,017
[SPEAKER_07]: It's also their very big hit song called Out of the Blue.

1773
02:17:25,278 --> 02:17:26,498
[SPEAKER_07]: See if this sounds familiar.

1774
02:17:28,758 --> 02:17:29,938
Out of the Blue

1775
02:17:57,731 --> 02:17:59,233
[SPEAKER_26]: What kind of disco was it?

1776
02:17:59,454 --> 02:18:03,499
[SPEAKER_26]: I don't know, could it be something that was maybe on, I don't know, Be Rare 5?

1777
02:18:03,539 --> 02:18:05,803
Something that's gonna make people scream.

1778
02:18:05,823 --> 02:18:07,405
Star, Star, what's it called?

1779
02:18:15,353 --> 02:18:18,195
[SPEAKER_07]: It's freaking feelings won't fade, you goddamn retards.

1780
02:18:18,215 --> 02:18:20,536
[SPEAKER_07]: You didn't do anything to change the song at all.

1781
02:18:20,736 --> 02:18:21,877
[SPEAKER_07]: You blatantly stole it.

1782
02:18:22,037 --> 02:18:24,938
[SPEAKER_07]: You can't say that you covered it because, well, there's no singing.

1783
02:18:25,319 --> 02:18:26,679
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you suck.

1784
02:18:27,059 --> 02:18:28,600
[SPEAKER_07]: Come up with some original shit.

1785
02:18:28,941 --> 02:18:32,843
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sure Look to the Skies will probably rip off of something else, but I have to find it first.

1786
02:18:33,443 --> 02:18:34,744
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you're lucky for now.

1787
02:18:35,544 --> 02:18:36,865
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm about to expose you.

1788
02:18:39,574 --> 02:18:45,239
[SPEAKER_07]: But anyways, yes, I am very pissed off at the fact that you blatantly ripped off Out of the Blue.

1789
02:18:45,579 --> 02:18:48,821
[SPEAKER_07]: So, that's enough of that.

1790
02:18:49,122 --> 02:18:50,583
[SPEAKER_07]: And sorry about the Bumani Cell thing.

1791
02:18:51,524 --> 02:18:54,946
[SPEAKER_07]: Another F you to them for having their goddamn music on their front page.

1792
02:18:55,106 --> 02:18:56,527
[SPEAKER_07]: I hate that goddamn music.

1793
02:18:56,948 --> 02:19:01,451
[SPEAKER_07]: Be like DDR Mania X and keep it turned off, unless I want it turned on.

1794
02:19:01,992 --> 02:19:04,294
[SPEAKER_07]: Or changes to something else, you know, something catchy.

1795
02:19:06,673 --> 02:19:08,715
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, FU... One little comment, sorry.

1796
02:19:08,835 --> 02:19:09,035
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1797
02:19:09,255 --> 02:19:14,159
[SPEAKER_15]: I thought that the whole deal of having, you know, music play on your main page went out when people stopped using GeoCities.

1798
02:19:16,461 --> 02:19:19,123
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, it came back with people using Flash on their pages.

1799
02:19:20,224 --> 02:19:21,725
[SPEAKER_07]: Um... It came back with Zynga.

1800
02:19:21,845 --> 02:19:23,346
[SPEAKER_07]: And Shockwave, actually.

1801
02:19:24,767 --> 02:19:27,690
[SPEAKER_07]: But anyways, no, but mine still rocks, other than their little music.

1802
02:19:28,090 --> 02:19:29,291
[SPEAKER_07]: Change the music and you'll be perfect.

1803
02:19:30,012 --> 02:19:32,894
[SPEAKER_07]: Um... An FU for, um...

1804
02:19:34,036 --> 02:19:40,117
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see, first off, for the stages at RVGL still being kind of slanted.

1805
02:19:40,798 --> 02:19:46,239
[SPEAKER_07]: It's kind of not quite flat, so that kind of sucks.

1806
02:19:47,279 --> 02:19:53,401
[SPEAKER_07]: F you to the fact that, let's see, I don't know, I'm not too angsty.

1807
02:19:53,801 --> 02:19:56,341
[SPEAKER_07]: F you to the stupid drivers because I hate you everywhere.

1808
02:19:56,641 --> 02:19:59,262
[SPEAKER_07]: And there's all types of drivers and I think I yelled at you all today.

1809
02:19:59,982 --> 02:20:02,764
[SPEAKER_07]: You have to quote Jahi on this one.

1810
02:20:02,784 --> 02:20:04,745
[SPEAKER_07]: A hole in your muffler does not make a modification.

1811
02:20:29,455 --> 02:20:37,444
[SPEAKER_07]: No, but anyways, um... F you to, uh... I don't know.

1812
02:20:38,204 --> 02:20:40,066
[SPEAKER_07]: I got thrown off when people start talking.

1813
02:20:42,029 --> 02:20:42,129
[SPEAKER_07]: Um...

1814
02:20:44,341 --> 02:20:44,801
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I know.

1815
02:20:45,241 --> 02:20:59,244
[SPEAKER_07]: After you, the stupid bitch that, like, ran over our curb at work, it, like, um, totally shattered it all, and now my friend's probably gonna get blamed for it, because, you know, they have a giant bus, and, you know, it's gonna look like the bus ran over it, even though it's the delivery man, so that kinda sucks.

1816
02:21:00,044 --> 02:21:09,026
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, fuck you, the G4, because, um, you still suck, you haven't heeded any of my advice, and, you know, you can burn in hell.

1817
02:21:09,506 --> 02:21:11,187
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't even have any new programming.

1818
02:21:11,367 --> 02:21:13,448
[SPEAKER_07]: You're talking about what happened at E3.

1819
02:21:15,509 --> 02:21:15,789
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay?

1820
02:21:16,690 --> 02:21:18,211
[SPEAKER_07]: E3's been over for a while now.

1821
02:21:18,551 --> 02:21:18,851
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay?

1822
02:21:19,491 --> 02:21:21,532
[SPEAKER_07]: E3 is not breaking news, okay?

1823
02:21:23,093 --> 02:21:28,236
[SPEAKER_07]: And to say that you have new daily content is a lie anyways, because you film your shows like once every month.

1824
02:21:29,436 --> 02:21:32,238
[SPEAKER_07]: And then repeat them over and over and over and over and over again.

1825
02:21:32,758 --> 02:21:38,261
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, playing full motion video, or not necessarily full motion video, but playing...

1826
02:21:38,962 --> 02:21:43,504
[SPEAKER_07]: Video game screenshots to music does not constitute a show.

1827
02:21:44,745 --> 02:21:45,605
[SPEAKER_07]: So please stop.

1828
02:21:49,387 --> 02:21:54,729
[SPEAKER_15]: And, um... What the hell are you... They're eating Mike and Ike's with chopsticks.

1829
02:21:54,749 --> 02:21:55,489
[SPEAKER_07]: Stop being Asian.

1830
02:21:57,130 --> 02:21:58,350
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't think she can help that.

1831
02:21:58,711 --> 02:22:00,451
[SPEAKER_15]: Not talking about puppies.

1832
02:22:02,072 --> 02:22:06,034
[SPEAKER_07]: But, um... Uh... Yeah...

1833
02:22:07,449 --> 02:22:10,331
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know, F you to our racist neighbor.

1834
02:22:15,195 --> 02:22:15,876
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm done.

1835
02:22:15,936 --> 02:22:19,078
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't have anything to bitch about right now because it doesn't come to me.

1836
02:22:19,098 --> 02:22:20,880
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just like, yeah.

1837
02:22:23,702 --> 02:22:24,162
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

1838
02:22:25,683 --> 02:22:26,144
[SPEAKER_07]: My turn.

1839
02:22:26,943 --> 02:22:28,643
[SPEAKER_07]: This song makes me want to eat some beef.

1840
02:22:29,103 --> 02:22:30,384
[SPEAKER_07]: My FUs are pretty quick this week.

1841
02:22:30,624 --> 02:22:35,325
[SPEAKER_07]: FU to the fact that everything in this goddamn town closes so early.

1842
02:22:35,465 --> 02:22:36,345
[SPEAKER_07]: I hate that shit.

1843
02:22:36,365 --> 02:22:41,326
[SPEAKER_07]: And I know I've said FU about this before, but I'm saying it again because it's still true.

1844
02:22:41,406 --> 02:22:42,166
[SPEAKER_07]: This town sucks.

1845
02:22:42,746 --> 02:22:45,166
[SPEAKER_07]: So, that's my first FU.

1846
02:22:45,206 --> 02:22:49,127
[SPEAKER_07]: My second FU goes to two things that happened in San Francisco.

1847
02:22:49,547 --> 02:22:54,028
[SPEAKER_07]: There's the Folsom Street Fair, which happened today.

1848
02:22:54,928 --> 02:22:56,689
[SPEAKER_07]: That happened today in San Francisco.

1849
02:22:57,090 --> 02:22:59,851
[SPEAKER_07]: And the Castro Street Fair, which happens next Sunday.

1850
02:23:00,492 --> 02:23:02,393
[SPEAKER_07]: Why does this shit happen on a Sunday?

1851
02:23:02,953 --> 02:23:05,295
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't go if you have this stuff on a Sunday.

1852
02:23:05,755 --> 02:23:06,836
[SPEAKER_07]: Have it on a Saturday.

1853
02:23:06,896 --> 02:23:07,536
[SPEAKER_07]: You suck.

1854
02:23:08,057 --> 02:23:09,498
[SPEAKER_07]: And your town is dirty.

1855
02:23:09,618 --> 02:23:11,359
[SPEAKER_07]: And I know a lot of people live in San Francisco.

1856
02:23:11,659 --> 02:23:14,080
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like our number one market, but you know what?

1857
02:23:14,781 --> 02:23:16,082
[SPEAKER_07]: The town is dirty.

1858
02:23:18,514 --> 02:23:21,036
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sure it's not you guys that listen to Horizons Radio to make it dirty.

1859
02:23:21,076 --> 02:23:22,317
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the other million people living there.

1860
02:23:22,337 --> 02:23:23,377
[SPEAKER_07]: We can't pick up their trash.

1861
02:23:24,138 --> 02:23:24,718
[SPEAKER_07]: It's gross.

1862
02:23:24,879 --> 02:23:25,879
[SPEAKER_07]: Frisco's a gross city.

1863
02:23:25,919 --> 02:23:28,261
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh my god, do a million people really live in San Francisco?

1864
02:23:28,281 --> 02:23:31,904
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's actually 700,000, but I'm counting the surrounding area a little bit too.

1865
02:23:31,924 --> 02:23:33,245
[SPEAKER_15]: That's why I'm glad I don't live there.

1866
02:23:34,786 --> 02:23:36,508
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, so, yeah.

1867
02:23:36,808 --> 02:23:39,730
[SPEAKER_07]: Screw you, San Francisco, and your stupid planning.

1868
02:23:41,011 --> 02:23:41,351
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

1869
02:23:42,973 --> 02:23:44,033
[SPEAKER_07]: Rest of the room's turn.

1870
02:23:44,053 --> 02:23:45,595
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's start with Puppy.

1871
02:23:45,615 --> 02:23:45,755
[SPEAKER_07]: Puppy.

1872
02:23:48,823 --> 02:23:52,044
[SPEAKER_31]: Whoa, I almost did not catch the microphone.

1873
02:23:53,385 --> 02:23:57,266
[SPEAKER_08]: Are we having like a porn DVD slideshow on the camera or something?

1874
02:23:57,286 --> 02:23:58,067
[SPEAKER_08]: Damn, FUs.

1875
02:24:00,108 --> 02:24:05,690
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, um, fuck you to class starting because it's class and that's just the way it is.

1876
02:24:06,910 --> 02:24:13,593
[SPEAKER_31]: And, um, fuck you to my bike for like being really crappy.

1877
02:24:15,839 --> 02:24:24,154
[SPEAKER_31]: and fucking through the tree outside over the parking lot at my apartment complex because it made my car really fucking dirty with a whole bunch of sap and tree shit.

1878
02:24:26,653 --> 02:24:29,874
[SPEAKER_31]: and, um, um, hmm.

1879
02:24:30,994 --> 02:24:36,436
[SPEAKER_31]: Fuck Ikea, because of the press sawdust crap.

1880
02:24:39,296 --> 02:24:41,677
[SPEAKER_31]: And fuck Scandia for going to shit.

1881
02:24:44,157 --> 02:24:45,818
[SPEAKER_31]: And, yeah, I'm done.

1882
02:24:49,199 --> 02:24:49,279
[SPEAKER_31]: RKDN.

1883
02:24:52,096 --> 02:24:56,077
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, okay, uh, fuck you to general stupidity, especially when it's my own, yeah.

1884
02:24:56,897 --> 02:24:58,638
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, fuck you to stupid telemarketers.

1885
02:24:59,278 --> 02:25:02,719
[SPEAKER_07]: I gotta, I, cause I, on Tuesday, I got a call.

1886
02:25:03,019 --> 02:25:05,820
[SPEAKER_07]: I, I have to now, I have to pick up the phone, cause people might call me now.

1887
02:25:06,520 --> 02:25:07,700
[SPEAKER_07]: And, I might have to talk to people.

1888
02:25:08,300 --> 02:25:12,341
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I pick up the phone, and it says, please, we have no available operators.

1889
02:25:12,522 --> 02:25:13,962
[SPEAKER_07]: Please wait for the next operator.

1890
02:25:14,542 --> 02:25:15,502
[SPEAKER_07]: I hate that shit.

1891
02:25:16,162 --> 02:25:17,663
[SPEAKER_07]: So fucking stupid.

1892
02:25:18,294 --> 02:25:18,895
[SPEAKER_07]: So I had to hang up.

1893
02:25:18,935 --> 02:25:19,635
[SPEAKER_05]: I hung up before.

1894
02:25:20,396 --> 02:25:20,696
[SPEAKER_05]: Idiots.

1895
02:25:22,658 --> 02:25:25,120
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's see, anything else to say fuck you to?

1896
02:25:26,981 --> 02:25:27,562
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, man.

1897
02:25:33,026 --> 02:25:34,047
[SPEAKER_30]: Fuck you for doing it right.

1898
02:25:36,710 --> 02:25:36,990
[SPEAKER_07]: Damn.

1899
02:25:37,350 --> 02:25:38,751
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I think I'm out of it.

1900
02:25:39,232 --> 02:25:41,534
[SPEAKER_07]: I might think of something, so go ahead.

1901
02:25:41,614 --> 02:25:41,794
[SPEAKER_07]: Aaron.

1902
02:25:43,311 --> 02:25:52,122
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't have a lot this week, actually, but, um, Fuck You goes to whoever broke the wheel on the initial D-machine at the MU Arcade.

1903
02:25:53,063 --> 02:25:57,828
[SPEAKER_10]: It, thanks to you, it no longer has the 270 degrees in either direction.

1904
02:25:57,848 --> 02:26:00,552
[SPEAKER_10]: It goes... Yes, it spins freely!

1905
02:26:00,612 --> 02:26:02,494
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just like RTA all over again.

1906
02:26:03,260 --> 02:26:09,302
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think I know, I think it was one of those fat teenie bop, fat like high school teenie boppers I saw there on like Friday afternoon.

1907
02:26:09,942 --> 02:26:10,863
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm not for sure.

1908
02:26:10,883 --> 02:26:12,183
[SPEAKER_22]: I was broken a couple days ago.

1909
02:26:13,444 --> 02:26:15,024
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh no, it wasn't broken, trust me.

1910
02:26:15,745 --> 02:26:16,925
[SPEAKER_10]: It wasn't bro- was it?

1911
02:26:16,945 --> 02:26:19,006
[SPEAKER_22]: I was there on Friday morning.

1912
02:26:20,106 --> 02:26:21,507
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I was there before that, I think.

1913
02:26:23,207 --> 02:26:23,847
[SPEAKER_10]: Whatever.

1914
02:26:23,867 --> 02:26:26,328
[SPEAKER_10]: But, um, let's see.

1915
02:26:26,348 --> 02:26:30,590
[SPEAKER_10]: Haku goes to Workload English 57 for being exactly like high school?

1916
02:26:31,266 --> 02:26:36,210
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't like group work, I don't like the teacher, and I hate it, and I want to get out of there as fast as possible.

1917
02:26:39,492 --> 02:26:46,797
[SPEAKER_10]: Fuck you, those stupid neighbors who live outside me who are always either blasting the music or trying to be ghetto thugs.

1918
02:26:48,558 --> 02:26:49,739
[SPEAKER_10]: Be yourselves for once.

1919
02:26:50,139 --> 02:26:50,760
[SPEAKER_10]: Come on now.

1920
02:26:52,201 --> 02:26:53,762
[SPEAKER_10]: They are ghetto thugs.

1921
02:26:53,782 --> 02:26:55,343
[SPEAKER_10]: They're trying to act like ghetto thugs.

1922
02:26:57,084 --> 02:27:00,847
[SPEAKER_10]: And... I can't really think of any...

1923
02:27:03,370 --> 02:27:08,436
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh yeah, and fuck you to that stupid skillet that my parents gave me that doesn't actually work.

1924
02:27:08,496 --> 02:27:10,258
[SPEAKER_10]: It just happens to burn everything that you put in it.

1925
02:27:11,380 --> 02:27:13,122
[SPEAKER_10]: Because it's metal and it's not cast iron.

1926
02:27:13,182 --> 02:27:13,583
[SPEAKER_10]: So yeah.

1927
02:27:16,827 --> 02:27:19,751
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, let's move on and see what our chat room has to say, shall we?

1928
02:27:23,260 --> 02:27:33,048
[SPEAKER_07]: Brack2000 would like to say, F you to Overloaded, the Lesson 2 song, not being a real DDR Max 2 song, and only a stupid Lesson Mode song.

1929
02:27:34,549 --> 02:27:37,171
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh-oh, VHG needs to respond to something in the showroom.

1930
02:27:37,191 --> 02:27:38,813
[SPEAKER_10]: Someone asked why I'm in workload English.

1931
02:27:38,873 --> 02:27:45,258
[SPEAKER_10]: It's because I got cocky on my subject A, and I didn't put a thesis in my essay, so now I'm stuck there, and my friends are in workload English.

1932
02:27:46,727 --> 02:27:47,808
[SPEAKER_10]: Biohazard has a lot of these cheeses.

1933
02:28:01,058 --> 02:28:03,639
[SPEAKER_07]: Fuck me for missing Orange Lounge Radio for three weeks.

1934
02:28:03,679 --> 02:28:04,519
[SPEAKER_07]: That's right, fuck you.

1935
02:28:06,180 --> 02:28:08,780
[SPEAKER_07]: Fuck Overloaded for being so owns-or.

1936
02:28:09,721 --> 02:28:11,041
[SPEAKER_07]: Fuck Chex Quest.

1937
02:28:11,301 --> 02:28:12,402
[SPEAKER_07]: These are coming from Biohazard.

1938
02:28:13,342 --> 02:28:15,623
[SPEAKER_07]: Fuck 2DX controllers being so expensive.

1939
02:28:16,143 --> 02:28:18,323
[SPEAKER_07]: Fuck my CD burner for being broken.

1940
02:28:18,443 --> 02:28:22,665
[SPEAKER_07]: Fuck my QX949 for its bad mid-left front channel capacitor.

1941
02:28:23,385 --> 02:28:24,265
[SPEAKER_07]: Capacitor, sorry.

1942
02:28:24,605 --> 02:28:25,166
[SPEAKER_07]: I read that wrong.

1943
02:28:25,606 --> 02:28:26,146
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry!

1944
02:28:27,326 --> 02:28:29,367
[SPEAKER_07]: Fuck my terrible C++ compiler.

1945
02:28:31,317 --> 02:28:37,119
[SPEAKER_07]: Fuck the guy who sold me a wireless PS2 controller and just cut the cord off a regular controller.

1946
02:28:39,340 --> 02:28:40,080
[SPEAKER_06]: That's great.

1947
02:28:42,041 --> 02:28:48,683
[SPEAKER_22]: Did Loki, was that you?

1948
02:28:48,963 --> 02:28:53,745
[SPEAKER_07]: Biohazard also says, fuck my jelly bean tin having a finite supply on jelly bellies.

1949
02:28:55,569 --> 02:28:59,735
[SPEAKER_07]: Fuck HAPP controllers for wanting $12.99 for a 2DX style button.

1950
02:29:00,857 --> 02:29:02,759
[SPEAKER_07]: Fuck peeps who talk like this.

1951
02:29:03,000 --> 02:29:03,941
[SPEAKER_07]: This is Asian writing.

1952
02:29:04,762 --> 02:29:05,764
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry, ASEAN writing.

1953
02:29:06,144 --> 02:29:07,826
[SPEAKER_07]: And expect me to read it.

1954
02:29:08,948 --> 02:29:10,170
[SPEAKER_07]: Fuck really negative people.

1955
02:29:11,153 --> 02:29:20,435
[SPEAKER_10]: It's funny, regardless of how old these people are, they still talk like they're in middle school.

1956
02:29:20,715 --> 02:29:23,415
[SPEAKER_06]: Just pay the money for the half controls button.

1957
02:29:23,435 --> 02:29:25,216
[SPEAKER_06]: I bought like 16 of them.

1958
02:29:25,296 --> 02:29:26,036
[SPEAKER_06]: Get over it.

1959
02:29:32,597 --> 02:29:33,057
[SPEAKER_07]: Moving on.

1960
02:29:34,778 --> 02:29:36,598
[SPEAKER_07]: HK Holly, Aaron would like to read this one.

1961
02:29:37,624 --> 02:29:42,226
[SPEAKER_10]: This is mostly an inside joke from Calibimani, but fuck you, green vaginal ooze.

1962
02:29:45,807 --> 02:29:46,407
[SPEAKER_07]: Beautiful.

1963
02:29:47,007 --> 02:29:49,088
[SPEAKER_07]: Vaginal ooze is funny when it's green, too.

1964
02:29:50,829 --> 02:29:51,389
[SPEAKER_05]: Boy, oh boy.

1965
02:29:52,789 --> 02:29:56,132
[SPEAKER_07]: 23rd Magus would like to say, F you to Angel's fucked up work schedule.

1966
02:29:56,152 --> 02:29:57,553
[SPEAKER_07]: She misses the show again.

1967
02:29:58,174 --> 02:30:00,736
[SPEAKER_07]: F you to forgetting to wake my dad up in time to get a ride to the show.

1968
02:30:01,116 --> 02:30:01,797
[SPEAKER_07]: You missed food.

1969
02:30:02,637 --> 02:30:03,338
[SPEAKER_07]: I am to suck.

1970
02:30:04,339 --> 02:30:04,779
[SPEAKER_07]: No comment.

1971
02:30:05,400 --> 02:30:09,543
[SPEAKER_07]: F you to hatching a pouring egg, naming it, giving it a backpack, and then forgetting to feed it.

1972
02:30:09,883 --> 02:30:10,544
[SPEAKER_07]: 20k down the hole.

1973
02:30:10,984 --> 02:30:11,945
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a Ragnarok reference.

1974
02:30:12,706 --> 02:30:15,408
[SPEAKER_07]: And once again, fuck the lamers on Ragnarok Online.

1975
02:30:15,808 --> 02:30:16,249
[SPEAKER_07]: Please.

1976
02:30:16,729 --> 02:30:17,550
[SPEAKER_07]: Or PLZ.

1977
02:30:17,610 --> 02:30:18,550
[SPEAKER_07]: What's a PLZ?

1978
02:30:18,951 --> 02:30:20,872
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, you want me to heal the monster you're fighting?

1979
02:30:20,992 --> 02:30:21,373
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1980
02:30:24,625 --> 02:30:25,505
[SPEAKER_15]: I have an F you.

1981
02:30:25,545 --> 02:30:27,146
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know if you just said it because I was in the bathroom.

1982
02:30:27,927 --> 02:30:29,907
[SPEAKER_15]: A big fuck you goes to Botters on Ragnarok.

1983
02:30:30,808 --> 02:30:31,548
[SPEAKER_15]: I hate you all.

1984
02:30:32,188 --> 02:30:34,910
[SPEAKER_15]: And I hope that your computers explode and you all catch Stars of the Ass.

1985
02:30:36,951 --> 02:30:37,351
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1986
02:30:40,012 --> 02:30:42,613
[SPEAKER_07]: Chaos says F you to Heartburn.

1987
02:30:42,853 --> 02:30:43,273
[SPEAKER_07]: That's it.

1988
02:30:45,414 --> 02:30:46,135
[SPEAKER_07]: Heartburn does suck.

1989
02:30:46,175 --> 02:30:46,475
[SPEAKER_07]: I hate it.

1990
02:30:48,596 --> 02:30:52,320
[SPEAKER_07]: NoStylin says, my FU of the week is paying bills.

1991
02:30:52,580 --> 02:30:55,843
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like you have bills and you pay them off and you have more of them.

1992
02:30:56,304 --> 02:30:57,685
[SPEAKER_07]: And you wonder where the hell they came from.

1993
02:30:57,745 --> 02:30:58,526
[SPEAKER_07]: So I go, huh.

1994
02:30:59,006 --> 02:31:00,568
[SPEAKER_07]: You pay bills and more come.

1995
02:31:00,588 --> 02:31:01,308
[SPEAKER_07]: What's up with that?

1996
02:31:01,889 --> 02:31:04,011
[SPEAKER_07]: I find how once you get money, it's gone in a second.

1997
02:31:04,051 --> 02:31:05,232
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, screw the government.

1998
02:31:05,553 --> 02:31:08,315
[SPEAKER_07]: Screw Gray Davis and this whole recall thing.

1999
02:31:08,596 --> 02:31:13,060
[SPEAKER_07]: And screw expensive schools that try to rip you off with name brand products which you don't have.

2000
02:31:15,786 --> 02:31:16,907
[SPEAKER_07]: Screw you to the recall.

2001
02:31:17,087 --> 02:31:18,347
[SPEAKER_07]: Governor and the recall?

2002
02:31:19,787 --> 02:31:20,007
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

2003
02:31:20,087 --> 02:31:20,548
[SPEAKER_07]: One or the other?

2004
02:31:20,928 --> 02:31:22,888
[SPEAKER_07]: Screw you to anything involving the recall.

2005
02:31:22,948 --> 02:31:23,848
[SPEAKER_07]: Just go away.

2006
02:31:25,329 --> 02:31:27,009
[SPEAKER_05]: It involves him.

2007
02:31:27,489 --> 02:31:33,991
[SPEAKER_07]: Tal would like to say F you to Final Fantasy Tactics Advance because I don't actually own the game or the Game Boy Advance so I have to borrow both.

2008
02:31:34,291 --> 02:31:35,192
[SPEAKER_07]: You moocher!

2009
02:31:35,572 --> 02:31:36,192
[SPEAKER_07]: You moocher!

2010
02:31:36,212 --> 02:31:39,553
[SPEAKER_07]: You have my DDR Max and you have someone else's Tactics and Game Boy.

2011
02:31:39,653 --> 02:31:40,033
[SPEAKER_07]: Mooch!

2012
02:31:41,453 --> 02:31:42,834
[SPEAKER_07]: And you have Jamie's Parappa.

2013
02:31:43,094 --> 02:31:43,414
[SPEAKER_07]: Mooch!

2014
02:31:44,281 --> 02:31:46,704
[SPEAKER_05]: It's Moochie the Moocher here on Orson Welles Radio.

2015
02:31:47,525 --> 02:31:48,226
[SPEAKER_08]: Mooch.

2016
02:31:48,246 --> 02:31:48,726
[SPEAKER_08]: That's so bad.

2017
02:31:49,587 --> 02:31:50,068
[SPEAKER_08]: Mooch.

2018
02:31:50,088 --> 02:31:50,368
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

2019
02:31:51,049 --> 02:31:51,850
[SPEAKER_08]: He's in Davis.

2020
02:31:52,030 --> 02:31:53,191
[SPEAKER_08]: That's where he's supposed to be from.

2021
02:31:53,392 --> 02:31:56,215
[SPEAKER_07]: Talon also likes to say, F you to initial D. I know you love me.

2022
02:31:56,235 --> 02:31:58,758
[SPEAKER_07]: Because the music and the animation style sucks.

2023
02:31:58,938 --> 02:32:01,341
[SPEAKER_07]: And the story is straight out of a bad samurai movie.

2024
02:32:02,216 --> 02:32:04,980
[SPEAKER_07]: and FU to my DVD drive for dying.

2025
02:32:08,324 --> 02:32:09,205
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, that's it.

2026
02:32:09,405 --> 02:32:10,547
[SPEAKER_07]: That's all the FUs of the week.

2027
02:32:10,567 --> 02:32:11,348
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for playing.

2028
02:32:13,270 --> 02:32:17,355
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, so I think we'll take another break.

2029
02:32:18,576 --> 02:32:27,498
[SPEAKER_07]: We exhausted all our new Max MP3s, so why don't we go back and visit Max USA 1?

2030
02:32:28,498 --> 02:32:29,619
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll go back and visit that.

2031
02:32:29,679 --> 02:32:33,660
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to play some songs from Max 1 USA.

2032
02:32:34,000 --> 02:32:35,680
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to get stabbed with a pitchfork.

2033
02:32:35,900 --> 02:32:38,601
[SPEAKER_07]: What am I getting stabbed with if I play Sandstorm?

2034
02:32:38,621 --> 02:32:39,621
[SPEAKER_07]: Chopsticks.

2035
02:32:39,641 --> 02:32:41,982
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, we're going to start this break off with Sandstorm.

2036
02:32:44,842 --> 02:32:47,123
[SPEAKER_07]: And after that, we'll hear some other things from Max USA.

2037
02:32:49,278 --> 02:32:49,458
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

2038
02:32:49,498 --> 02:32:50,259
[SPEAKER_15]: Daughters die.

2039
02:32:52,201 --> 02:32:52,602
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

2040
02:32:52,642 --> 02:32:53,623
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you for sharing.

2041
02:32:53,643 --> 02:32:54,584
[SPEAKER_15]: Find it from my message board.

2042
02:32:55,364 --> 02:32:55,705
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

2043
02:32:56,005 --> 02:32:57,366
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll be back after this break.

2044
02:32:57,527 --> 02:32:58,748
[SPEAKER_07]: And what do you guys think?

2045
02:32:59,466 --> 02:33:01,868
[SPEAKER_07]: How about Ask Orange Lounge when we come back?

2046
02:33:02,308 --> 02:33:02,648
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure!

2047
02:33:02,728 --> 02:33:08,031
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, the chat room has some questions, so send your questions now for Ask Orange Lounge.

2048
02:33:08,752 --> 02:33:12,494
[SPEAKER_07]: And for the 5,000th time, we'll play Overloaded after the show.

2049
02:33:13,175 --> 02:33:14,756
[SPEAKER_07]: We've already played it tonight during the show.

2050
02:33:15,216 --> 02:33:17,778
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I'm going to overload you in a minute.

2051
02:33:17,838 --> 02:33:19,619
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, we'll be back.

2052
02:33:19,639 --> 02:33:27,444
[SPEAKER_07]: Ask Orange Lounge

2053
02:33:28,737 --> 02:33:31,861
Thanks for watching!

2054
02:34:51,006 --> 02:34:52,137
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah, drop the bombs

2059
02:38:11,288 --> 02:38:15,992
[SPEAKER_07]: Anybody have any quick thoughts, any other Bimani related things they wanted to talk about before we get into Ask Orange Lounge?

2060
02:38:16,012 --> 02:38:17,733
[SPEAKER_07]: No, not really.

2061
02:38:18,694 --> 02:38:20,055
[SPEAKER_07]: Any interesting Bimani stories?

2062
02:38:20,075 --> 02:38:21,656
[SPEAKER_15]: I have a question to ask the chat room.

2063
02:38:21,696 --> 02:38:22,116
[SPEAKER_07]: What's that?

2064
02:38:22,437 --> 02:38:23,077
[SPEAKER_15]: Is it safe?

2065
02:38:23,638 --> 02:38:24,138
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it safe?

2066
02:38:25,439 --> 02:38:29,282
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, you have to send your questions over private message or they aren't counted.

2067
02:38:30,013 --> 02:38:35,555
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, real fast, just to plug some of our other programming on Orange Lodge Radio, bringing you live programming more throughout the week.

2068
02:38:36,075 --> 02:38:43,757
[SPEAKER_07]: Tomorrow night is Vanilla Sky featuring myself and my cohorts in Crime Rice Princess and Lanky Style.

2069
02:38:43,797 --> 02:38:50,039
[SPEAKER_07]: And we just sit around and we talk about other video games and we kind of talk about other weird stuff too.

2070
02:38:50,059 --> 02:38:53,500
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll talk about what's in the news and how it relates to our world and things that piss us off.

2071
02:38:53,820 --> 02:38:54,941
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh my God, you read the news.

2072
02:38:55,041 --> 02:38:58,662
[SPEAKER_07]: And Yahoo, yes, we read the news to our listeners because they aren't going to get it any other way.

2073
02:38:59,342 --> 02:39:05,104
[SPEAKER_07]: and we make fun of Yahoo and we do video game trivia to bad music and all sorts of fun things like that.

2074
02:39:05,545 --> 02:39:07,805
[SPEAKER_07]: So tune in at 7 o'clock Monday night Pacific time.

2075
02:39:08,346 --> 02:39:11,927
[SPEAKER_07]: On Tuesday nights... Excuse me.

2076
02:39:13,067 --> 02:39:14,248
[SPEAKER_15]: That was a peanut burp.

2077
02:39:15,788 --> 02:39:15,909
[SPEAKER_15]: Ew.

2078
02:39:16,229 --> 02:39:16,649
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, anyway.

2079
02:39:17,449 --> 02:39:19,510
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, Tuesday night is Pump Up the Volume.

2080
02:39:20,456 --> 02:39:23,199
[SPEAKER_15]: where I play your requests from our chat room.

2081
02:39:23,759 --> 02:39:26,722
[SPEAKER_15]: Except the thing is nobody requests anything, god damn it.

2082
02:39:26,762 --> 02:39:28,503
[SPEAKER_07]: That's okay, more songs you get to play for yourself.

2083
02:39:28,583 --> 02:39:33,708
[SPEAKER_15]: So you get to, I'll basically partake in my really weird taste in music.

2084
02:39:33,728 --> 02:39:37,051
[SPEAKER_15]: I used to do a show called Ice for Five Minutes.

2085
02:39:37,812 --> 02:39:38,673
[SPEAKER_15]: That's it on the channel.

2086
02:39:42,396 --> 02:39:45,519
[SPEAKER_07]: This week on Orange Lounge Radio on Thursday, I will do a show called Ice...

2087
02:39:48,021 --> 02:39:50,623
[SPEAKER_07]: Pikachu Pikachu Pikachu Pikachu

2088
02:40:18,140 --> 02:40:18,580
[SPEAKER_06]: What's that?

2089
02:40:19,941 --> 02:40:20,362
[SPEAKER_06]: No!

2090
02:40:20,562 --> 02:40:21,042
[SPEAKER_06]: No!

2091
02:40:21,643 --> 02:40:22,463
[SPEAKER_06]: Seriously!

2092
02:40:22,624 --> 02:40:24,225
[SPEAKER_06]: A new show.

2093
02:40:25,246 --> 02:40:25,686
[SPEAKER_06]: Seriously.

2094
02:40:26,267 --> 02:40:27,908
[SPEAKER_06]: What are you talking about?

2095
02:40:27,948 --> 02:40:29,749
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't get the mic any closer.

2096
02:40:29,769 --> 02:40:30,390
[SPEAKER_06]: They're away.

2097
02:40:31,150 --> 02:40:31,551
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, okay.

2098
02:40:31,771 --> 02:40:33,332
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyways, so, the new show.

2099
02:40:33,973 --> 02:40:36,114
[SPEAKER_07]: It's gonna be a game show.

2100
02:40:36,855 --> 02:40:37,856
[SPEAKER_06]: Ooh, a game show!

2101
02:40:37,896 --> 02:40:38,636
[SPEAKER_06]: My favorite!

2102
02:40:38,957 --> 02:40:41,839
[SPEAKER_07]: A new... Uh, yeah.

2103
02:40:41,899 --> 02:40:43,120
[SPEAKER_07]: As long as there's nothing in the box.

2104
02:40:44,401 --> 02:40:45,442
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, you can have the box.

2105
02:40:47,631 --> 02:40:54,035
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyways, new game show, possibly, if I decide I don't want to do Livewire anymore.

2106
02:40:54,936 --> 02:41:00,459
[SPEAKER_07]: It will be, there will actually be prizes, serious, like real prizes given away.

2107
02:41:01,160 --> 02:41:02,260
[SPEAKER_07]: And what kind of game show will this be?

2108
02:41:02,280 --> 02:41:02,821
[SPEAKER_07]: Do we know yet?

2109
02:41:02,981 --> 02:41:03,261
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

2110
02:41:03,961 --> 02:41:05,803
[SPEAKER_07]: Something crazy, very crazy.

2111
02:41:06,163 --> 02:41:13,127
[SPEAKER_07]: I was going to call it like, attention... Why are the girls yelling for porn?

2112
02:41:14,108 --> 02:41:15,869
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, it was either going to be called something like...

2113
02:41:17,305 --> 02:41:18,106
[SPEAKER_07]: Shut up!

2114
02:41:18,867 --> 02:41:22,030
[SPEAKER_07]: Like the 10 second attention span show or something like that.

2115
02:41:22,230 --> 02:41:22,550
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

2116
02:41:23,951 --> 02:41:24,432
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll be fine.

2117
02:41:26,934 --> 02:41:27,435
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll be fine.

2118
02:41:28,716 --> 02:41:29,076
[SPEAKER_15]: Porn!

2119
02:41:31,218 --> 02:41:33,480
[SPEAKER_15]: Back to my show, which I am still...

2120
02:41:36,118 --> 02:41:38,019
[SPEAKER_15]: It starts at 7 o'clock is the pre-show.

2121
02:41:38,399 --> 02:41:39,899
[SPEAKER_15]: At 7.30 the show begins to 10.30.

2122
02:41:40,860 --> 02:41:42,340
[SPEAKER_15]: And basically I just play a bunch of crap.

2123
02:41:43,020 --> 02:41:47,622
[SPEAKER_15]: And I've been saying that I'm going to do video game music trivia, but I don't know.

2124
02:41:48,502 --> 02:41:50,723
[SPEAKER_15]: People, send me songs.

2125
02:41:50,983 --> 02:41:54,164
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, I'll have my IRC open.

2126
02:41:54,204 --> 02:41:57,265
[SPEAKER_15]: My name is DarkSakuraSSF.

2127
02:41:57,965 --> 02:42:00,446
[SPEAKER_15]: So start sending me video game music if you want to play.

2128
02:42:01,046 --> 02:42:02,707
[SPEAKER_15]: If not, then you're a big stinky poopy head.

2129
02:42:03,883 --> 02:42:07,045
[SPEAKER_15]: And that's the bottom line, because DarkSakura said so.

2130
02:42:07,785 --> 02:42:11,006
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

2131
02:42:11,727 --> 02:42:14,808
[SPEAKER_07]: Wednesday nights are open.

2132
02:42:14,888 --> 02:42:19,690
[SPEAKER_15]: I was following the example of our, you know, Baymani influence system SF.

2133
02:42:20,391 --> 02:42:22,071
[SPEAKER_07]: Wednesday nights are open right now.

2134
02:42:22,111 --> 02:42:23,672
[SPEAKER_07]: We do a bit of randomness on Wednesdays.

2135
02:42:24,052 --> 02:42:29,555
[SPEAKER_07]: This week, I've been asked to do Orange Lounge Presents Trivial Pursuit on Wednesday.

2136
02:42:29,575 --> 02:42:29,655
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

2137
02:42:30,410 --> 02:42:32,031
[SPEAKER_07]: Which we might do, I don't know yet.

2138
02:42:32,812 --> 02:42:36,555
[SPEAKER_07]: I know there's enough interest from the regulars on all the shows to do it.

2139
02:42:37,255 --> 02:42:37,555
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

2140
02:42:38,736 --> 02:42:41,158
[SPEAKER_15]: If I was playing that, we'd have to break out the Genis edition.

2141
02:42:41,218 --> 02:42:47,082
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm thinking we're going to do Trivial Pursuit on Wednesday, but stay tuned to our chatroom for details.

2142
02:42:47,343 --> 02:42:50,805
[SPEAKER_07]: So drop in our chatroom sometime during the week, and we'll have a Trivial Pursuit this Wednesday.

2143
02:42:50,965 --> 02:42:52,927
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're not in the chatroom, you're not cool.

2144
02:42:52,947 --> 02:42:55,248
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, if you're not in our chatroom 24 hours a day, you're not cool.

2145
02:42:55,268 --> 02:42:56,089
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

2146
02:42:57,174 --> 02:42:58,717
[SPEAKER_07]: When I visit, like, maybe once a week.

2147
02:43:01,543 --> 02:43:03,727
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, if you're not there 24 hours a day, you're not cool.

2148
02:43:03,767 --> 02:43:06,032
[SPEAKER_07]: But if you're there 24-hour days, you don't have a life.

2149
02:43:07,695 --> 02:43:08,376
[SPEAKER_07]: And then you're not cool.

2150
02:43:10,311 --> 02:43:11,592
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a paradox.

2151
02:43:12,012 --> 02:43:12,572
[SPEAKER_07]: What a fun thought.

2152
02:43:12,612 --> 02:43:14,393
[SPEAKER_14]: Either way, you're a loser.

2153
02:43:15,334 --> 02:43:17,535
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

2154
02:43:17,575 --> 02:43:20,197
[SPEAKER_07]: Thursday night, Snowden's Lounge Radio is hiatus right now.

2155
02:43:20,237 --> 02:43:22,058
[SPEAKER_07]: We might be doing some repeats of Livewire.

2156
02:43:22,918 --> 02:43:25,460
[SPEAKER_07]: If I get brave, I might do a new mix, so we'll see.

2157
02:43:25,660 --> 02:43:27,161
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, there might be another potential.

2158
02:43:28,621 --> 02:43:29,622
[SPEAKER_07]: I did one mega mix.

2159
02:43:29,682 --> 02:43:31,103
[SPEAKER_07]: It played after Vanilla Sky one week.

2160
02:43:31,763 --> 02:43:33,304
[SPEAKER_15]: There might be another potential goodie, though.

2161
02:43:33,991 --> 02:43:35,133
[SPEAKER_07]: Hmm, a goodie.

2162
02:43:36,215 --> 02:43:38,860
[SPEAKER_07]: Ah, yes, we have another show that may be coming up soon.

2163
02:43:38,920 --> 02:43:40,743
[SPEAKER_07]: So, maybe not this Thursday, but soon.

2164
02:43:40,823 --> 02:43:46,633
[SPEAKER_15]: Which, you know, I think that we need to introduce one of our newer listeners as another foreign correspondent.

2165
02:43:47,649 --> 02:43:49,630
[SPEAKER_15]: Even though he probably can't make it up here.

2166
02:43:51,230 --> 02:43:52,010
[SPEAKER_15]: He's probably not listening.

2167
02:43:52,630 --> 02:43:53,331
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think he's listening.

2168
02:43:53,351 --> 02:43:54,911
[SPEAKER_07]: He's not in the chat room.

2169
02:43:54,951 --> 02:43:56,031
[SPEAKER_15]: Make sure he's here next week.

2170
02:43:56,051 --> 02:43:57,872
[SPEAKER_15]: He doesn't get foreign correspondent status.

2171
02:43:57,992 --> 02:43:59,992
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll give him a proper introduction next week if he shows up.

2172
02:44:00,032 --> 02:44:01,933
[SPEAKER_07]: In the meantime, we've only got 20 minutes left of show.

2173
02:44:02,253 --> 02:44:03,834
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, no, 25 because we started late tonight.

2174
02:44:04,834 --> 02:44:07,294
[SPEAKER_07]: We have plenty of questions that have already been submitted.

2175
02:44:07,334 --> 02:44:09,035
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not too late if you want to join in.

2176
02:44:10,252 --> 02:44:12,974
[SPEAKER_07]: Go into www.callybomani.com.

2177
02:44:13,134 --> 02:44:15,115
[SPEAKER_07]: Break out the earplugs because Rob's going to sing.

2178
02:44:15,495 --> 02:44:17,956
[SPEAKER_07]: Click on Orange Lounge and click on chat.

2179
02:44:18,356 --> 02:44:21,998
[SPEAKER_07]: And you can submit a question for Ask Orange Lounge.

2180
02:44:22,558 --> 02:44:24,099
[SPEAKER_07]: We have to listen to Rob sing.

2181
02:44:27,839 --> 02:44:29,079
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's Ask Orange Lounge.

2182
02:44:29,099 --> 02:44:30,880
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a good question.

2183
02:44:31,540 --> 02:44:34,581
[SPEAKER_07]: Rob's going to sing all week this week on Orange Lounge Radio.

2184
02:44:34,681 --> 02:44:38,362
[SPEAKER_07]: Jamie needs to stop playing with a fucking ferret.

2185
02:44:38,862 --> 02:44:42,043
[SPEAKER_07]: Or I'm going to get Loki to shove it up her ass.

2186
02:44:46,104 --> 02:44:46,424
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

2187
02:44:46,504 --> 02:44:46,764
[SPEAKER_06]: Rob.

2188
02:44:47,384 --> 02:44:47,724
[SPEAKER_06]: Rob.

2189
02:44:48,064 --> 02:44:48,304
[SPEAKER_06]: Rob.

2190
02:44:48,484 --> 02:44:48,705
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

2191
02:44:48,805 --> 02:44:49,025
[SPEAKER_06]: Rob.

2192
02:44:49,045 --> 02:44:49,265
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

2193
02:44:49,425 --> 02:44:49,625
[SPEAKER_06]: Rob.

2194
02:44:49,665 --> 02:44:49,885
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

2195
02:44:49,965 --> 02:44:50,145
[SPEAKER_06]: Rob.

2196
02:44:50,185 --> 02:44:50,425
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

2197
02:44:50,525 --> 02:44:50,725
[SPEAKER_06]: Rob.

2198
02:44:50,765 --> 02:44:51,005
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

2199
02:44:51,385 --> 02:44:51,705
[SPEAKER_06]: Rob.

2200
02:44:51,925 --> 02:44:52,125
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

2201
02:44:56,124 --> 02:44:57,005
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

2202
02:44:57,485 --> 02:45:00,247
[SPEAKER_06]: Biohazard has about seven questions.

2203
02:45:00,267 --> 02:45:02,408
[SPEAKER_13]: Shut up.

2204
02:45:02,428 --> 02:45:05,390
[SPEAKER_06]: Biohazard has about seven questions to ask tonight.

2205
02:45:05,930 --> 02:45:07,771
[SPEAKER_06]: Shut the fuck up.

2206
02:45:09,292 --> 02:45:10,733
[SPEAKER_06]: Has about seven questions to ask.

2207
02:45:11,733 --> 02:45:12,034
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

2208
02:45:17,277 --> 02:45:18,498
[SPEAKER_13]: He's turning red in the face.

2209
02:45:18,598 --> 02:45:20,699
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm starting off with questions from Biohazard.

2210
02:45:21,604 --> 02:45:22,345
[SPEAKER_13]: Rob!

2211
02:45:22,405 --> 02:45:23,085
[SPEAKER_07]: Rob!

2212
02:45:24,166 --> 02:45:24,486
[SPEAKER_07]: Shut up.

2213
02:45:24,786 --> 02:45:27,808
[SPEAKER_07]: Why doesn't Jimmy crack carrots or potatoes or something?

2214
02:45:27,868 --> 02:45:29,129
[SPEAKER_07]: Corn is so boring.

2215
02:45:31,551 --> 02:45:33,012
[SPEAKER_15]: Why doesn't Jimmy just do crack?

2216
02:45:34,173 --> 02:45:34,993
[SPEAKER_07]: Good, I like that.

2217
02:45:37,255 --> 02:45:44,420
[SPEAKER_07]: Biohazard also wants to know, how long will I have to wait for Overloaded to be available on Bomani Style or acquire it some other way?

2218
02:45:44,720 --> 02:45:46,161
[SPEAKER_07]: Excuse me, are we Bomani Style?

2219
02:45:46,301 --> 02:45:47,462
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, are we Bomani Style?

2220
02:45:47,622 --> 02:45:49,684
[SPEAKER_08]: There's already a sim file up and it sucks.

2221
02:45:49,744 --> 02:45:50,244
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't get it.

2222
02:45:54,568 --> 02:45:56,029
[SPEAKER_15]: We're not the Monty style.

2223
02:45:56,049 --> 02:45:56,690
[SPEAKER_15]: Go ask them.

2224
02:45:56,850 --> 02:45:57,651
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, go ask them.

2225
02:45:59,292 --> 02:46:04,817
[SPEAKER_07]: If you were a member of our Orange Lounge Radio Live Journal community, you would have already gotten a link to that file.

2226
02:46:05,838 --> 02:46:06,379
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, that's right.

2227
02:46:06,419 --> 02:46:08,421
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki posted it earlier this week, didn't he?

2228
02:46:10,523 --> 02:46:11,984
[SPEAKER_07]: Who cares about the step file?

2229
02:46:12,024 --> 02:46:12,464
[SPEAKER_07]: Orange Lounge.

2230
02:46:12,604 --> 02:46:13,966
[SPEAKER_07]: Make your own damn step file.

2231
02:46:15,618 --> 02:46:18,681
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah, and why he cracks corn so you don't care.

2232
02:46:19,322 --> 02:46:20,684
[SPEAKER_07]: Because it's so boring, you don't care.

2233
02:46:21,504 --> 02:46:24,468
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, we missed you on the first part.

2234
02:46:25,088 --> 02:46:30,875
[SPEAKER_15]: People got a lot of free time if they're coming up with questions like, why does Jimmy crack corn and not potatoes?

2235
02:46:31,415 --> 02:46:33,137
[SPEAKER_15]: You can't crack potatoes anyway.

2236
02:46:33,157 --> 02:46:35,380
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll read one more from Biohazard, then I'm going to somebody else.

2237
02:46:35,400 --> 02:46:36,501
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll come back to the rest of his questions.

2238
02:46:37,000 --> 02:46:47,122
[SPEAKER_07]: Biohazard wants to know, how would I write a script for Sis Reset to display a random line from a TXT file every time exclamation bad joke is pulled?

2239
02:46:48,322 --> 02:46:48,902
[SPEAKER_15]: Do what?

2240
02:46:49,002 --> 02:46:50,543
[SPEAKER_15]: Is that like a chatbot?

2241
02:46:50,583 --> 02:46:52,143
[SPEAKER_07]: It's some nerdy chatbot thing, yeah.

2242
02:46:52,303 --> 02:46:55,063
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, you're not in our chatroom because we don't allow chatbots.

2243
02:46:55,323 --> 02:47:00,964
[SPEAKER_15]: So, you know, you can go... I don't know, blow a gorilla.

2244
02:47:00,984 --> 02:47:01,725
[SPEAKER_32]: Okay.

2245
02:47:04,773 --> 02:47:05,493
[SPEAKER_07]: Who was that anyway?

2246
02:47:05,934 --> 02:47:06,914
[SPEAKER_07]: Biohazard, again.

2247
02:47:06,934 --> 02:47:07,815
[SPEAKER_15]: Don't use the chatbots.

2248
02:47:08,135 --> 02:47:09,636
[SPEAKER_15]: We will kick you if you do.

2249
02:47:10,276 --> 02:47:13,237
[SPEAKER_07]: Biohazard also wants to know, because Aaron really wants to answer this, so I'll do one more.

2250
02:47:13,658 --> 02:47:15,639
[SPEAKER_07]: Why get mad when you can get glad?

2251
02:47:16,979 --> 02:47:23,042
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, you know, I don't really know, but what I say is, why get mad when you can just use that energy and put it into sex?

2252
02:47:26,224 --> 02:47:26,964
[SPEAKER_13]: Why get mad?

2253
02:47:27,024 --> 02:47:27,645
[SPEAKER_13]: Get horny!

2254
02:47:27,785 --> 02:47:29,106
[SPEAKER_13]: Don't get mad, get violent!

2255
02:47:32,589 --> 02:47:36,433
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, it's Violent Horny Girl here on Orange Lounge Radio, VHG.

2256
02:47:42,198 --> 02:47:43,940
[SPEAKER_07]: Special guest, Violent Horny Girl.

2257
02:47:43,980 --> 02:47:44,421
[SPEAKER_07]: I like it.

2258
02:47:44,461 --> 02:47:44,761
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

2259
02:47:47,421 --> 02:47:48,221
[SPEAKER_22]: PPGL1.

2260
02:47:48,481 --> 02:47:49,462
[SPEAKER_07]: Damn it, I'm not original.

2261
02:47:49,522 --> 02:47:49,802
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

2262
02:47:50,102 --> 02:47:52,502
[SPEAKER_07]: But I was the first to call you Violent Hyper Gangbang, was I not?

2263
02:47:53,583 --> 02:47:54,223
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

2264
02:47:54,303 --> 02:47:55,443
[SPEAKER_15]: Violent Horny Gangbang.

2265
02:47:55,843 --> 02:47:56,863
[SPEAKER_07]: Ah, Violent Horny Gangbang.

2266
02:47:56,883 --> 02:47:57,323
[SPEAKER_07]: I like that.

2267
02:47:58,064 --> 02:47:58,604
[SPEAKER_07]: Variation.

2268
02:47:58,624 --> 02:48:00,544
[SPEAKER_07]: How about Velvet Horny Gangbang?

2269
02:48:02,585 --> 02:48:03,605
[SPEAKER_15]: Violence is more fun.

2270
02:48:04,225 --> 02:48:05,045
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

2271
02:48:05,185 --> 02:48:09,146
[SPEAKER_07]: 23rd Magus would like to know, how's the food... Ah, who cares?

2272
02:48:09,166 --> 02:48:09,686
[SPEAKER_07]: Be nice.

2273
02:48:11,027 --> 02:48:12,207
[SPEAKER_07]: How's the food over there?

2274
02:48:13,627 --> 02:48:14,588
[SPEAKER_07]: Because we all ate tonight.

2275
02:48:14,868 --> 02:48:15,948
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, no one's dead yet.

2276
02:48:16,676 --> 02:48:18,417
[SPEAKER_11]: The food was good.

2277
02:48:19,737 --> 02:48:20,378
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

2278
02:48:20,678 --> 02:48:21,358
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, hairball.

2279
02:48:23,119 --> 02:48:25,700
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, the food's gone, so it was eaten.

2280
02:48:27,821 --> 02:48:30,582
[SPEAKER_10]: At best, it was at least tolerable if it's all gone.

2281
02:48:33,658 --> 02:48:34,899
[SPEAKER_07]: And Jamie makes a sad face.

2282
02:48:35,019 --> 02:48:36,399
[SPEAKER_07]: The eel was interesting.

2283
02:48:36,439 --> 02:48:38,720
[SPEAKER_07]: I've never really had eel in that mass quantity before.

2284
02:48:38,760 --> 02:48:39,481
[SPEAKER_07]: It was interesting.

2285
02:48:39,521 --> 02:48:41,962
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if I necessarily like the fiber, but it was good.

2286
02:48:42,042 --> 02:48:45,163
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't even notice really it was eel, because I ate it with chicken, too.

2287
02:48:45,403 --> 02:48:47,244
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, see, I had just straight up eel.

2288
02:48:47,304 --> 02:48:50,085
[SPEAKER_07]: It was a little weird for me, but it was good.

2289
02:48:51,066 --> 02:48:53,267
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, well, maybe that's why.

2290
02:48:54,454 --> 02:49:00,298
[SPEAKER_07]: It was good, though, and I appreciate Jamie's effort to cook for us because, you know, we're single and don't cook.

2291
02:49:00,358 --> 02:49:00,858
[SPEAKER_07]: At least I don't.

2292
02:49:01,018 --> 02:49:01,278
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway.

2293
02:49:02,619 --> 02:49:02,879
[SPEAKER_15]: Damn it.

2294
02:49:02,919 --> 02:49:04,961
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm going to make sure you guys have proper nutrition.

2295
02:49:06,962 --> 02:49:10,164
[SPEAKER_15]: You're eating instant rice and, like, super bacon.

2296
02:49:11,184 --> 02:49:16,408
[SPEAKER_15]: You are going to... I haven't had super bacon in a good two weeks.

2297
02:49:16,488 --> 02:49:19,509
[SPEAKER_15]: And still, I've seen what's in your fridge, and there's hardly anything in there.

2298
02:49:19,970 --> 02:49:20,930
[SPEAKER_15]: What do you guys live off of?

2299
02:49:21,070 --> 02:49:21,731
[SPEAKER_15]: Pop-Tarts?

2300
02:49:24,671 --> 02:49:25,252
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, Rob.

2301
02:49:26,052 --> 02:49:27,313
[SPEAKER_15]: For one week, I challenge you.

2302
02:49:28,954 --> 02:49:31,196
[SPEAKER_15]: You need to eat the same things that I do for a week.

2303
02:49:31,316 --> 02:49:32,337
[SPEAKER_32]: Oh, give me a break.

2304
02:49:32,977 --> 02:49:34,818
[SPEAKER_15]: What I eat is very, very easy.

2305
02:49:35,279 --> 02:49:35,819
[SPEAKER_15]: Very easy.

2306
02:49:36,460 --> 02:49:38,421
[SPEAKER_15]: You have to have a bowl of oatmeal in the morning.

2307
02:49:38,661 --> 02:49:38,841
Ew.

2308
02:49:39,782 --> 02:49:40,122
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

2309
02:49:40,142 --> 02:49:43,505
[SPEAKER_15]: Let me lick mud.

2310
02:49:44,265 --> 02:49:44,505
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

2311
02:49:44,565 --> 02:49:45,946
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki said, let me lick mud.

2312
02:49:47,367 --> 02:49:53,552
[SPEAKER_15]: Maple, maples, the brown sugar and maple instant oatmeal is really good.

2313
02:49:54,864 --> 02:49:56,164
[SPEAKER_15]: and Yoplait Yogurt is really good.

2314
02:49:56,184 --> 02:49:58,605
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, no, it's for old people.

2315
02:49:58,625 --> 02:50:00,225
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, no, it's for people who like to shit.

2316
02:50:01,065 --> 02:50:01,285
[SPEAKER_15]: Wait.

2317
02:50:01,545 --> 02:50:02,646
[SPEAKER_07]: Wait, you like to shit?

2318
02:50:03,926 --> 02:50:04,266
[SPEAKER_15]: No.

2319
02:50:05,266 --> 02:50:06,687
[SPEAKER_07]: It's TMI Radio.

2320
02:50:06,787 --> 02:50:07,247
[SPEAKER_15]: No.

2321
02:50:08,247 --> 02:50:13,508
[SPEAKER_15]: That's why old people eat it, but it's good for like your... It's fiber.

2322
02:50:13,988 --> 02:50:14,848
[SPEAKER_15]: Fiber's good for you.

2323
02:50:15,868 --> 02:50:22,710
[SPEAKER_15]: And then for lunch, you need to have like a microwave dinner because they're really good.

2324
02:50:23,704 --> 02:50:25,786
[SPEAKER_15]: and veggie burgers for dinner every night.

2325
02:50:26,726 --> 02:50:26,927
[SPEAKER_32]: Ew.

2326
02:50:27,047 --> 02:50:27,527
[SPEAKER_15]: They're good.

2327
02:50:29,048 --> 02:50:29,769
[SPEAKER_15]: Veggie cheeseburger.

2328
02:50:29,889 --> 02:50:31,710
[SPEAKER_07]: I have veggie burgers for lunch.

2329
02:50:32,571 --> 02:50:33,231
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, that's good.

2330
02:50:33,451 --> 02:50:35,093
[SPEAKER_15]: But see, one week.

2331
02:50:35,833 --> 02:50:36,193
[SPEAKER_15]: One week.

2332
02:50:37,174 --> 02:50:37,795
[SPEAKER_15]: No Pop-Tarts.

2333
02:50:39,136 --> 02:50:40,777
[SPEAKER_07]: I actually, I don't eat Pop-Tarts, actually.

2334
02:50:40,797 --> 02:50:41,497
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't like Pop-Tarts.

2335
02:50:41,537 --> 02:50:47,121
[SPEAKER_07]: I usually have either a Nutri-Grain bar in the morning or, like, I won't eat breakfast until when I get to work on a bag of pretzels.

2336
02:50:47,722 --> 02:50:48,943
[SPEAKER_17]: That's not good for you.

2337
02:50:49,543 --> 02:50:51,004
[SPEAKER_07]: I try Nutri-Grain bars, though.

2338
02:50:51,084 --> 02:50:51,825
[SPEAKER_07]: That's usually what I eat.

2339
02:50:57,327 --> 02:51:03,828
[SPEAKER_07]: I have my super hot chocolate when I get to work.

2340
02:51:03,888 --> 02:51:10,070
[SPEAKER_07]: It's three bags of hot chocolate concentrated and then I put a little bit of hot water in there so it's like super frothy.

2341
02:51:11,490 --> 02:51:12,190
[SPEAKER_07]: That's all I eat.

2342
02:51:12,490 --> 02:51:13,871
[SPEAKER_07]: Everything is super with you.

2343
02:51:15,722 --> 02:51:16,983
[SPEAKER_07]: 23rd Magazine would also like to know.

2344
02:51:17,524 --> 02:51:17,724
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

2345
02:51:18,244 --> 02:51:22,087
[SPEAKER_15]: The thing I used to have when I worked at this stupid temp agency that no longer exists in my universe.

2346
02:51:23,108 --> 02:51:30,834
[SPEAKER_15]: I would have half a cup of super strong coffee and then pour the rest of it in hot chocolate and then throw in like five packs of sugar.

2347
02:51:31,455 --> 02:51:33,036
[SPEAKER_15]: And that was what I would drink every morning.

2348
02:51:33,056 --> 02:51:33,737
[SPEAKER_06]: That's healthy.

2349
02:51:33,757 --> 02:51:35,518
[SPEAKER_15]: See, I don't drink that crap anymore.

2350
02:51:35,598 --> 02:51:39,201
[SPEAKER_15]: I've been off of my soda now for a week, so I'm happy.

2351
02:51:39,922 --> 02:51:40,142
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

2352
02:51:42,428 --> 02:51:47,933
[SPEAKER_07]: 23rd Magus would like to also know Sky, that's me, could you give me my jokes back please?

2353
02:51:49,234 --> 02:51:50,054
[SPEAKER_15]: What, all three of them?

2354
02:51:50,274 --> 02:51:51,936
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, you wish you could be as cool as me.

2355
02:51:54,057 --> 02:51:55,538
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, he has negative jokes now.

2356
02:51:56,299 --> 02:52:00,742
[SPEAKER_07]: Campbell Soup, one of our new chatters, unless it's somebody who changed their name, I don't think so.

2357
02:52:01,363 --> 02:52:04,485
[SPEAKER_07]: Campbell Soup would like to know, what's up with the foam on beer?

2358
02:52:06,046 --> 02:52:06,687
[SPEAKER_07]: Good question.

2359
02:52:06,747 --> 02:52:07,828
[SPEAKER_15]: It's what makes you fart.

2360
02:52:09,369 --> 02:52:10,870
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki has a comment.

2361
02:52:13,960 --> 02:52:16,361
[SPEAKER_07]: Why is beer better than women?

2362
02:52:17,362 --> 02:52:17,642
[SPEAKER_07]: Why?

2363
02:52:18,142 --> 02:52:20,463
[SPEAKER_07]: Because no matter how you pour it, you always have good head.

2364
02:52:27,987 --> 02:52:28,947
[SPEAKER_07]: I did a magasism.

2365
02:52:32,909 --> 02:52:34,490
[SPEAKER_07]: He doesn't tell R-rated jokes, though.

2366
02:52:36,130 --> 02:52:37,291
[SPEAKER_07]: Why is there foam on beer?

2367
02:52:37,591 --> 02:52:39,232
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just the way God made it, okay?

2368
02:52:39,272 --> 02:52:41,413
[SPEAKER_07]: But all I have to say is don't drink beer, drink Guinness.

2369
02:52:43,206 --> 02:52:45,709
[SPEAKER_15]: Beard tastes like... pee smells.

2370
02:52:46,029 --> 02:52:51,054
[SPEAKER_07]: Foam is there to remind you that you're wasting your time, and if you want to get fucked up, just drink some hard liquor.

2371
02:52:51,135 --> 02:52:55,319
[SPEAKER_07]: Go straight for the 151, or the Schlager, or Everclear.

2372
02:52:55,479 --> 02:52:57,321
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, alcohol recipe of the week.

2373
02:52:58,022 --> 02:52:58,803
[SPEAKER_15]: Apple pie.

2374
02:52:58,963 --> 02:53:01,486
[SPEAKER_07]: The foam is there to remind you that you're a pussy, you're drinking beer.

2375
02:53:02,501 --> 02:53:06,003
[SPEAKER_15]: You get a big glass gallon jug of apple juice.

2376
02:53:06,623 --> 02:53:08,104
[SPEAKER_15]: And then you pour it all out in another container.

2377
02:53:08,784 --> 02:53:13,987
[SPEAKER_15]: And then you pour in about half a bottle of Everclear and let cinnamon sticks dissolve in it.

2378
02:53:15,007 --> 02:53:17,749
[SPEAKER_15]: And then you pour in the apple juice and let it sit for like a couple days.

2379
02:53:18,429 --> 02:53:21,611
[SPEAKER_15]: And you have apple pie.

2380
02:53:21,751 --> 02:53:23,812
[SPEAKER_07]: 23rd Magus says beer goes down easy.

2381
02:53:23,932 --> 02:53:27,774
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'd like to know, is that the beer or the beer bottle in your case?

2382
02:53:28,514 --> 02:53:29,815
[SPEAKER_15]: Beer is nasty.

2383
02:53:32,975 --> 02:53:33,656
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I'm mean.

2384
02:53:35,276 --> 02:53:35,816
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm so mean.

2385
02:53:35,836 --> 02:53:36,036
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

2386
02:53:36,056 --> 02:53:38,157
[SPEAKER_07]: Yours does smell nasty.

2387
02:53:38,277 --> 02:53:38,637
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

2388
02:53:40,898 --> 02:53:41,798
[SPEAKER_07]: Pip would like to know.

2389
02:53:41,858 --> 02:53:42,559
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, this is a good one.

2390
02:53:42,599 --> 02:53:45,239
[SPEAKER_07]: And another new chatter, or at least a name I don't recognize.

2391
02:53:45,299 --> 02:53:49,121
[SPEAKER_07]: Pip would like to know, how did the ferret get into the show?

2392
02:53:49,741 --> 02:53:51,001
[SPEAKER_15]: Ferret's been here since day one.

2393
02:53:51,321 --> 02:53:56,023
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, we've been throwing it around and having the ferrets rape each other.

2394
02:53:57,203 --> 02:53:58,124
[SPEAKER_10]: Mad ferret sex.

2395
02:53:58,564 --> 02:53:58,844
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

2396
02:53:59,657 --> 02:54:04,221
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, ferret number one was a birthday gift to me from my old stalker.

2397
02:54:04,802 --> 02:54:06,744
[SPEAKER_07]: And I just, I have all these stuffed animals.

2398
02:54:07,044 --> 02:54:09,706
[SPEAKER_07]: Can you shut the goddamn thing up for one minute while I tell the story?

2399
02:54:09,966 --> 02:54:11,688
[SPEAKER_14]: It's the ferret story, he's contributing.

2400
02:54:11,748 --> 02:54:15,852
[SPEAKER_07]: We used to have, or I still do, I have all my stuffed animals on top of the computer.

2401
02:54:16,272 --> 02:54:20,716
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, I know you can't really see it on the webcam, but there's all these stuffed animals that sit on top of the computer.

2402
02:54:20,776 --> 02:54:23,759
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, Carmen, oh, Bradley's turning the thing over so you can see the stuffed animals.

2403
02:54:24,019 --> 02:54:27,921
[SPEAKER_07]: We have like Cartman, and Pikachu, and like a little stuffed devil.

2404
02:54:28,021 --> 02:54:30,562
[SPEAKER_07]: My happy birthday bear that Jamie got me, and all this stuff here.

2405
02:54:31,242 --> 02:54:33,823
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, it just went up to the cam, so there you go, you guys can look.

2406
02:54:35,104 --> 02:54:40,226
[SPEAKER_07]: And the ferret used to sit there, and one day Jamie pulled it down and started pushing the button and learned that it'd make noises.

2407
02:54:40,586 --> 02:54:43,027
[SPEAKER_07]: And behold, the show got worse.

2408
02:54:44,349 --> 02:54:49,030
[SPEAKER_05]: And then Loki found a second ferret at some random store and he brought it over to some show a while back.

2409
02:54:49,051 --> 02:54:51,851
[SPEAKER_15]: They sell them at Walgreens so everyone can have a ferret of their own.

2410
02:54:53,552 --> 02:54:54,272
[SPEAKER_07]: God, no.

2411
02:54:57,433 --> 02:54:57,773
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

2412
02:54:58,673 --> 02:54:59,274
[SPEAKER_07]: Moving on.

2413
02:55:00,994 --> 02:55:06,636
[SPEAKER_07]: HK Holly would like to know Can vegetarians eat animal crackers?

2414
02:55:07,796 --> 02:55:09,857
[SPEAKER_15]: As long as they're not made out of animal parts.

2415
02:55:14,040 --> 02:55:14,980
[SPEAKER_07]: That's an interesting question.

2416
02:55:15,040 --> 02:55:16,201
[SPEAKER_07]: I would say yes, it's okay.

2417
02:55:16,642 --> 02:55:19,784
[SPEAKER_07]: I think I know some vegetarians who do eat animal crackers.

2418
02:55:20,204 --> 02:55:23,747
[SPEAKER_07]: Especially, you know what's good are those animal crackers with the frosting on them and the little balls.

2419
02:55:24,107 --> 02:55:25,668
[SPEAKER_07]: The mother's crackers, you know what I'm talking about?

2420
02:55:25,729 --> 02:55:26,869
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yes, the mother's cookies.

2421
02:55:26,889 --> 02:55:27,990
[SPEAKER_07]: Mother's animal cookies.

2422
02:55:28,491 --> 02:55:29,051
[SPEAKER_07]: Those are the best.

2423
02:55:29,071 --> 02:55:29,551
[SPEAKER_07]: Good shit.

2424
02:55:29,792 --> 02:55:30,312
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes they are.

2425
02:55:30,392 --> 02:55:32,194
[SPEAKER_07]: I wouldn't care if I was vegan, I'd still eat them.

2426
02:55:34,135 --> 02:55:34,956
[SPEAKER_08]: They're so fattening though.

2427
02:55:34,976 --> 02:55:37,878
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just reminded of an old question.

2428
02:55:39,499 --> 02:55:40,440
[SPEAKER_08]: Do vegans swallow?

2429
02:55:43,030 --> 02:55:44,592
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, and I know.

2430
02:55:45,794 --> 02:55:46,334
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, okay.

2431
02:55:46,735 --> 02:55:47,055
[SPEAKER_07]: Too much.

2432
02:55:47,075 --> 02:55:47,976
[SPEAKER_07]: I used to date a vegan.

2433
02:55:49,738 --> 02:55:50,059
[SPEAKER_13]: Whale.

2434
02:55:53,280 --> 02:55:53,560
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

2435
02:55:53,780 --> 02:55:58,244
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, Tal says, as a vegetarian, he would just like to say, yes, he can eat animal cookies.

2436
02:55:58,484 --> 02:55:58,885
[SPEAKER_07]: So there you go.

2437
02:55:58,905 --> 02:55:59,485
[SPEAKER_07]: There's your question.

2438
02:55:59,665 --> 02:56:01,326
[SPEAKER_07]: You learn something new on Orange Lounge Radio every day.

2439
02:56:02,167 --> 02:56:04,629
[SPEAKER_07]: We're still accepting questions for Ask Orange Lounge, by the way.

2440
02:56:04,669 --> 02:56:06,991
[SPEAKER_07]: Just send them over private message to Sky in the chat room.

2441
02:56:07,732 --> 02:56:08,712
[SPEAKER_07]: No, we still have a few left.

2442
02:56:09,153 --> 02:56:12,455
[SPEAKER_07]: Biohazard sent me plenty to get us through a whole other show.

2443
02:56:13,576 --> 02:56:15,298
[SPEAKER_07]: www.caliabomani.com.

2444
02:56:15,338 --> 02:56:16,579
[SPEAKER_07]: Click on Orange Lounge and click on chat.

2445
02:56:16,599 --> 02:56:16,839
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

2446
02:56:18,021 --> 02:56:19,861
[SPEAKER_07]: Nostylan, oh god.

2447
02:56:20,221 --> 02:56:20,742
[SPEAKER_07]: Here it is.

2448
02:56:20,942 --> 02:56:22,562
[SPEAKER_07]: No, here it is.

2449
02:56:22,902 --> 02:56:24,202
[SPEAKER_07]: It's actually a good question.

2450
02:56:25,363 --> 02:56:25,743
[SPEAKER_07]: Here it is.

2451
02:56:26,403 --> 02:56:29,263
[SPEAKER_07]: How come you guys don't play more Eurobeat?

2452
02:56:33,764 --> 02:56:38,985
[SPEAKER_10]: I guess my theory would be because to a lot of people who don't know Eurobeat, it all sounds exactly the same.

2453
02:56:42,026 --> 02:56:45,727
[SPEAKER_07]: Nostylan also says there should be a Bomani Eurobeat hour.

2454
02:56:46,387 --> 02:56:46,867
[SPEAKER_10]: No!

2455
02:56:47,904 --> 02:56:48,924
[SPEAKER_10]: God, no!

2456
02:56:49,044 --> 02:56:50,645
[SPEAKER_10]: What the hell is wrong with you?

2457
02:56:52,665 --> 02:56:54,206
[SPEAKER_07]: What was the question?

2458
02:56:54,346 --> 02:56:56,307
[SPEAKER_07]: Why doesn't Orange Lounge Radio play more Eurobeat?

2459
02:56:57,507 --> 02:56:58,427
[SPEAKER_07]: We can play more Eurobeat.

2460
02:56:58,707 --> 02:57:00,428
[SPEAKER_07]: Jamie's done Eurobeat pre-shows.

2461
02:57:01,008 --> 02:57:04,329
[SPEAKER_15]: I've done, like, hours of Eurobeat on my show, too.

2462
02:57:04,469 --> 02:57:04,829
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what?

2463
02:57:04,869 --> 02:57:06,810
[SPEAKER_07]: Tune into Jamie's show, because she's the biggest Eurobeat fan.

2464
02:57:06,870 --> 02:57:09,851
[SPEAKER_15]: I did, like, a two-hour marathon of Eurobeat a couple weeks ago.

2465
02:57:10,271 --> 02:57:10,551
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

2466
02:57:11,383 --> 02:57:11,903
[SPEAKER_07]: So you know what?

2467
02:57:11,983 --> 02:57:14,624
[SPEAKER_07]: If you don't think we play enough Eurobeat, you're listening to the wrong shows.

2468
02:57:15,084 --> 02:57:17,205
[SPEAKER_07]: Listen to Tuesday night's Pump Up the Volume.

2469
02:57:18,825 --> 02:57:19,085
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

2470
02:57:20,345 --> 02:57:21,366
[SPEAKER_07]: I am not vegan.

2471
02:57:21,426 --> 02:57:22,046
[SPEAKER_07]: God no.

2472
02:57:22,166 --> 02:57:23,686
[SPEAKER_07]: Like I have that kind of discipline.

2473
02:57:23,746 --> 02:57:24,466
[SPEAKER_07]: One of my exes is.

2474
02:57:26,107 --> 02:57:26,427
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

2475
02:57:27,507 --> 02:57:30,068
[SPEAKER_15]: He made this really good eggplant stuff at a party at my house.

2476
02:57:30,608 --> 02:57:33,729
[SPEAKER_15]: And nobody ate it but you and I. Well, I ate, like, lots of it.

2477
02:57:34,169 --> 02:57:34,429
[SPEAKER_07]: It was good.

2478
02:57:34,449 --> 02:57:34,769
[SPEAKER_07]: It was good.

2479
02:57:36,118 --> 02:57:40,947
[SPEAKER_07]: John Fields would like to know, what do you call a river that's too big for its bridges?

2480
02:57:43,291 --> 02:57:44,514
[SPEAKER_15]: You need to shut up right now.

2481
02:57:46,579 --> 02:57:48,461
[SPEAKER_15]: That was the worst pun ever.

2482
02:57:49,162 --> 02:57:51,425
[SPEAKER_07]: That was a pun straight out of 23rd Magus' book.

2483
02:57:51,745 --> 02:57:53,006
[SPEAKER_07]: You owe Magus a quarter.

2484
02:57:53,487 --> 02:57:54,969
[SPEAKER_07]: Give him a quarter for stealing the bill.

2485
02:57:54,989 --> 02:57:56,891
[SPEAKER_07]: Pay them royalties and we'll stick the RIA on you.

2486
02:57:57,011 --> 02:57:57,611
[SPEAKER_07]: Take it now.

2487
02:57:58,352 --> 02:58:00,234
[SPEAKER_15]: We'll stick the RIA on you if you don't.

2488
02:58:00,415 --> 02:58:02,016
[SPEAKER_07]: Nostylan has another question.

2489
02:58:02,377 --> 02:58:02,737
[SPEAKER_07]: God.

2490
02:58:03,939 --> 02:58:06,762
[SPEAKER_07]: What came first, the egg or the chicken?

2491
02:58:08,337 --> 02:58:09,418
[SPEAKER_07]: Depends on your religion.

2492
02:58:09,598 --> 02:58:15,283
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, in that sentence, the egg came first in your sentence, so... Yes, Loki.

2493
02:58:16,424 --> 02:58:16,904
[SPEAKER_07]: Get a mic.

2494
02:58:21,047 --> 02:58:26,051
[SPEAKER_07]: The chicken and egg rhetorical question is the dumbest thing ever because it's not actually a rhetorical question.

2495
02:58:26,352 --> 02:58:28,633
[SPEAKER_07]: They did not specify what type of an egg it was.

2496
02:58:29,094 --> 02:58:31,316
[SPEAKER_07]: Therefore, dinosaurs predated chickens.

2497
02:58:32,156 --> 02:58:33,557
[SPEAKER_07]: Therefore, the egg came first.

2498
02:58:40,959 --> 02:58:41,740
[SPEAKER_07]: That was deep.

2499
02:58:42,641 --> 02:58:45,583
[SPEAKER_15]: That was deep like a puddle.

2500
02:58:46,184 --> 02:58:50,027
[SPEAKER_07]: That was so deep.

2501
02:58:50,287 --> 02:58:55,592
[SPEAKER_07]: Going back to Biohazard's questions, because that's all the questions we have left, unless people send more over private messages to Sky.

2502
02:58:56,913 --> 02:58:58,694
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you think that it's safe?

2503
02:59:00,436 --> 02:59:00,656
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

2504
02:59:01,497 --> 02:59:02,658
[SPEAKER_15]: You're listening to the show, aren't you?

2505
02:59:05,698 --> 02:59:08,180
[SPEAKER_07]: The chatroom's talking about their vegetarian stints.

2506
02:59:08,680 --> 02:59:10,602
[SPEAKER_07]: I have actually had a vegetarian stint.

2507
02:59:10,682 --> 02:59:12,023
[SPEAKER_07]: I was vegetarian for about a month.

2508
02:59:13,224 --> 02:59:13,764
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what?

2509
02:59:14,425 --> 02:59:15,726
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to bet doing it.

2510
02:59:15,986 --> 02:59:24,973
[SPEAKER_15]: This is like, as of April, made two years that I've gone without beef or pork on a regular basis.

2511
02:59:25,253 --> 02:59:28,776
[SPEAKER_15]: I've, you know, had a nibble now and then, but I've stayed off of it.

2512
02:59:30,071 --> 02:59:33,573
[SPEAKER_07]: I would like to say I have not drank regular soda in about six months.

2513
02:59:34,494 --> 02:59:36,915
[SPEAKER_07]: But I need to cut back on diet, though, because I do drink diet.

2514
02:59:36,935 --> 02:59:37,936
[SPEAKER_07]: Diet is worse for you.

2515
02:59:38,276 --> 02:59:40,378
[SPEAKER_07]: I haven't smoked a cigarette in four years.

2516
02:59:42,599 --> 02:59:45,281
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, I haven't smoked a cigarette in five and a half years.

2517
02:59:45,661 --> 02:59:47,502
[SPEAKER_07]: I haven't smoked a cigarette in a week.

2518
02:59:49,364 --> 02:59:50,404
[SPEAKER_15]: You are so square.

2519
02:59:50,424 --> 02:59:51,985
[SPEAKER_15]: I know, aren't I?

2520
02:59:52,686 --> 02:59:52,966
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

2521
02:59:55,837 --> 02:59:59,681
[SPEAKER_07]: Biohazard would also like to know, why haven't I heard any ferrets yet?

2522
02:59:59,721 --> 03:00:00,521
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you burn them?

2523
03:00:00,842 --> 03:00:01,863
[SPEAKER_07]: Obviously we have not.

2524
03:00:01,923 --> 03:00:03,484
[SPEAKER_07]: Those fucking ferrets won't go away.

2525
03:00:04,866 --> 03:00:05,787
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks, thanks.

2526
03:00:06,748 --> 03:00:09,050
[SPEAKER_07]: Here's a somewhat serious question from Biohazard.

2527
03:00:09,070 --> 03:00:11,833
[SPEAKER_07]: Biohazard would like to know, why can't we vote for Holic?

2528
03:00:13,047 --> 03:00:14,928
[SPEAKER_07]: Because we said so, and we are the authority.

2529
03:00:15,008 --> 03:00:17,209
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I have the real answer to the question.

2530
03:00:17,769 --> 03:00:20,010
[SPEAKER_07]: Holic is already in rotation on the station.

2531
03:00:20,090 --> 03:00:24,151
[SPEAKER_07]: Therefore, if you vote for it, you're voting a song into rotation that's already in rotation.

2532
03:00:24,211 --> 03:00:24,691
[SPEAKER_07]: You rhymed, Rob.

2533
03:00:24,711 --> 03:00:25,832
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't need to vote for Holic.

2534
03:00:26,212 --> 03:00:27,192
[SPEAKER_10]: You rhymed, Rob.

2535
03:00:27,372 --> 03:00:27,873
[SPEAKER_07]: I rhymed.

2536
03:00:28,053 --> 03:00:28,273
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm great.

2537
03:00:28,293 --> 03:00:29,773
[SPEAKER_15]: Rotation on the station.

2538
03:00:30,073 --> 03:00:32,354
[SPEAKER_07]: Rotation on the station on Orzhov Radio.

2539
03:00:32,394 --> 03:00:33,415
[SPEAKER_15]: It's like a Eurobeat song.

2540
03:00:36,116 --> 03:00:38,337
[SPEAKER_14]: Now you sound like you're spitting on the microphone.

2541
03:00:41,298 --> 03:00:42,578
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just that calendar song.

2542
03:00:44,159 --> 03:00:51,001
[SPEAKER_07]: What is the meaning of... Oh, Biohazard also wants to know, what is the meaning of life expressed through interpretive dance in front of the webcam?

2543
03:00:51,221 --> 03:00:51,761
[SPEAKER_13]: Forty-two.

2544
03:00:54,882 --> 03:00:55,322
[SPEAKER_05]: Hold on.

2545
03:00:55,482 --> 03:00:58,103
[SPEAKER_05]: In about ten seconds, I'm going to show you.

2546
03:00:58,123 --> 03:01:01,584
[SPEAKER_05]: The next webcam image, I will be showing you the meaning of life.

2547
03:01:02,344 --> 03:01:05,285
[SPEAKER_05]: And I will be getting help from the others, showing you the meaning of life.

2548
03:01:05,325 --> 03:01:05,906
[SPEAKER_05]: There it goes.

2549
03:01:06,686 --> 03:01:06,986
[SPEAKER_05]: Four...

2550
03:01:09,622 --> 03:01:12,423
[SPEAKER_05]: The meaning of life is up there on our cam for you to see.

2551
03:01:13,683 --> 03:01:14,243
[SPEAKER_05]: Right now.

2552
03:01:17,705 --> 03:01:19,906
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

2553
03:01:19,946 --> 03:01:21,686
[SPEAKER_10]: I got your meaning of life.

2554
03:01:23,587 --> 03:01:27,369
[SPEAKER_10]: His last question is, why do I ask so many questions?

2555
03:01:28,069 --> 03:01:28,809
[SPEAKER_10]: Because you suck.

2556
03:01:30,430 --> 03:01:32,070
[SPEAKER_10]: No way, he answered his own questions.

2557
03:01:33,111 --> 03:01:34,171
[SPEAKER_13]: This is the meaning of life.

2558
03:01:39,897 --> 03:01:42,459
[SPEAKER_10]: Wait, wait, wait, he answered his own question, never mind.

2559
03:01:42,899 --> 03:01:45,581
[SPEAKER_10]: That was what I was going to say too, except I've been to more Volker.

2560
03:01:46,242 --> 03:01:47,442
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it skipped the picture.

2561
03:01:47,462 --> 03:01:49,644
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not there.

2562
03:01:51,145 --> 03:01:53,707
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, bummer.

2563
03:01:53,887 --> 03:01:57,369
[SPEAKER_07]: 23rd Magus, I'd like to know, will you people stop fucking stealing my jokes?

2564
03:01:57,489 --> 03:01:58,870
[SPEAKER_07]: Puns are my department, bitches.

2565
03:01:59,150 --> 03:01:59,731
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, you know what?

2566
03:01:59,751 --> 03:02:00,631
[SPEAKER_15]: Where's the meaning of life?

2567
03:02:00,671 --> 03:02:03,193
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you write the information for Max 2?

2568
03:02:03,493 --> 03:02:04,194
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think so.

2569
03:02:04,434 --> 03:02:05,675
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you write the information screens for that?

2570
03:02:05,715 --> 03:02:06,135
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think so.

2571
03:02:06,155 --> 03:02:07,596
[SPEAKER_07]: Therefore, you suck at puns.

2572
03:02:10,194 --> 03:02:13,057
[SPEAKER_07]: Nurse Stylin would like to know, how many sounds does the ferret have?

2573
03:02:13,157 --> 03:02:13,938
[SPEAKER_07]: About seven.

2574
03:02:15,559 --> 03:02:17,081
[SPEAKER_07]: And we don't need to hear them all.

2575
03:02:18,082 --> 03:02:19,183
[SPEAKER_07]: Look at the webcam right now.

2576
03:02:19,804 --> 03:02:25,229
[SPEAKER_07]: John Fields would like to know, any interest in any of the games that are being shown at Tokyo Game Show?

2577
03:02:25,890 --> 03:02:28,773
[SPEAKER_07]: Um... Well, DDR Party Edition, I guess.

2578
03:02:28,793 --> 03:02:28,833
[SPEAKER_07]: Um...

2579
03:02:34,387 --> 03:02:36,410
[SPEAKER_07]: Otherwise, I don't really give a shit, I find.

2580
03:02:37,011 --> 03:02:37,551
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what?

2581
03:02:37,631 --> 03:02:38,733
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll see them when we see them.

2582
03:02:39,153 --> 03:02:40,575
[SPEAKER_07]: Who cares if they're coming out in Tokyo?

2583
03:02:40,595 --> 03:02:41,256
[SPEAKER_07]: We need them out here.

2584
03:02:41,316 --> 03:02:44,319
[SPEAKER_07]: Because say this really great role-playing game comes out in Japan.

2585
03:02:44,399 --> 03:02:44,800
[SPEAKER_07]: Guess what?

2586
03:02:44,860 --> 03:02:45,581
[SPEAKER_07]: It's in Japanese.

2587
03:02:45,641 --> 03:02:46,221
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't matter.

2588
03:02:46,442 --> 03:02:47,183
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't read it.

2589
03:02:48,384 --> 03:02:50,727
[SPEAKER_15]: Hey, but if they put out another Grandia, I'll import it.

2590
03:02:56,641 --> 03:02:56,801
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

2591
03:02:57,661 --> 03:02:58,001
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

2592
03:02:59,522 --> 03:03:02,963
[SPEAKER_07]: Biohazard would also like to know, am I infamous for my bad questions yet?

2593
03:03:03,903 --> 03:03:04,403
[SPEAKER_10]: Actually, no.

2594
03:03:04,423 --> 03:03:06,623
[SPEAKER_10]: You just kind of act stupid to us.

2595
03:03:08,404 --> 03:03:11,045
[SPEAKER_07]: You sure are famous.

2596
03:03:11,165 --> 03:03:15,206
[SPEAKER_07]: 23rd Magus would like to know, is it true that Jason Enos asked for my help in writing the info screens?

2597
03:03:15,726 --> 03:03:16,546
[SPEAKER_07]: No, you made that up.

2598
03:03:19,088 --> 03:03:21,049
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, let's close up the mailbag.

2599
03:03:21,089 --> 03:03:22,669
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you everybody for playing Ask Orange Lounge.

2600
03:03:22,689 --> 03:03:24,730
[SPEAKER_15]: You know what we haven't looked at in a long time, Rob?

2601
03:03:25,070 --> 03:03:25,290
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry.

2602
03:03:25,310 --> 03:03:26,210
[SPEAKER_15]: Our actual mail.

2603
03:03:26,751 --> 03:03:27,131
[SPEAKER_07]: Hold on.

2604
03:03:29,872 --> 03:03:32,893
[SPEAKER_07]: Now we're done with Ask Orange Lounge Radio.

2605
03:03:33,433 --> 03:03:36,534
[SPEAKER_07]: We hope you learned something tonight on Ask Orange Lounge Radio.

2606
03:03:37,194 --> 03:03:38,435
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, guess what next week?

2607
03:03:38,975 --> 03:03:44,037
[SPEAKER_07]: The ferrets won't be here because I'm going to go outside and run them over with my car.

2608
03:03:47,298 --> 03:03:47,498
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

2609
03:03:51,377 --> 03:03:57,321
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see if... I'm just hoping the batteries fucking die someday.

2610
03:03:58,522 --> 03:03:59,843
[SPEAKER_07]: As are half our listeners, I'm sure.

2611
03:04:00,383 --> 03:04:00,704
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

2612
03:04:01,384 --> 03:04:03,706
[SPEAKER_15]: The show would not be the same without the ferret.

2613
03:04:03,726 --> 03:04:05,347
[SPEAKER_15]: The ferret is our mascot.

2614
03:04:08,049 --> 03:04:13,552
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, we're actually checking our actual email address at orangeloungeradio, all one word, at yahoo.com.

2615
03:04:13,572 --> 03:04:15,214
[SPEAKER_07]: And we have two new messages, it looks like.

2616
03:04:15,614 --> 03:04:16,534
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's spam.

2617
03:04:16,554 --> 03:04:16,935
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

2618
03:04:18,556 --> 03:04:19,056
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see.

2619
03:04:19,417 --> 03:04:20,637
[SPEAKER_07]: Yahoo Education.

2620
03:04:20,757 --> 03:04:22,018
[SPEAKER_07]: Advance your learning goals.

2621
03:04:22,078 --> 03:04:24,499
[SPEAKER_07]: Yahoo Education introduces courses and degrees.

2622
03:04:26,661 --> 03:04:28,121
[SPEAKER_07]: SBC Yahoo DSL.

2623
03:04:28,181 --> 03:04:30,983
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, only $29.95 a month for fast internet access.

2624
03:04:31,023 --> 03:04:31,783
[SPEAKER_07]: Isn't it about time?

2625
03:04:33,824 --> 03:04:35,666
[SPEAKER_07]: Then we have something in our bulk message, too.

2626
03:04:36,206 --> 03:04:41,849
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, we have a message that says, Would you like to submit something to our SubmitWW.com service?

2627
03:04:41,909 --> 03:04:44,310
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, because not enough people listen to Orange Launch Radio.

2628
03:04:44,330 --> 03:04:45,351
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess this bitch knows that.

2629
03:04:47,662 --> 03:04:49,404
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, so that's all we have in our mailbag.

2630
03:04:49,444 --> 03:04:56,810
[SPEAKER_07]: If you'd like to fill up our mailbag, orangeloungeradioatyahoo.com All right, we have some more Ask Orange Lounge questions.

2631
03:04:56,850 --> 03:04:58,471
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm taking these last three, and that's it.

2632
03:04:58,671 --> 03:05:00,853
[SPEAKER_07]: We're finishing this bit, and we're ending the show.

2633
03:05:01,093 --> 03:05:02,254
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's some fair to ask for you.

2634
03:05:02,294 --> 03:05:06,258
[SPEAKER_07]: Biohazard wants to know, what was the date of the first Orange Lounge radio show?

2635
03:05:06,778 --> 03:05:09,000
[SPEAKER_07]: The date of the first live show was June 23, 2002.

2636
03:05:14,145 --> 03:05:19,391
[SPEAKER_07]: The station first went on air, I think, May 18th of that year.

2637
03:05:19,471 --> 03:05:21,313
[SPEAKER_07]: May 18th or 22nd, somewhere in there.

2638
03:05:22,874 --> 03:05:24,016
[SPEAKER_07]: The first live show was June 23rd, 2002.

2639
03:05:28,572 --> 03:05:30,133
[SPEAKER_07]: 23rd Magus didn't have a question, he just had a comment.

2640
03:05:30,793 --> 03:05:33,934
[SPEAKER_07]: Nostylan wants to know, when will there be another Pimpin' Hoes party?

2641
03:05:33,994 --> 03:05:43,338
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess he's referring to my birthday party, which he wasn't at, so I don't know how he knows this, but I think someone he talks to a lot was part of the brains behind that party.

2642
03:05:44,159 --> 03:05:46,159
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe for someone else's birthday, I don't know.

2643
03:05:48,620 --> 03:05:51,421
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe for my next birthday, I'd love to have another Pimpin' Hoes party.

2644
03:05:52,242 --> 03:05:52,582
[SPEAKER_07]: No, Dirac.

2645
03:05:54,085 --> 03:05:58,846
[SPEAKER_07]: A Pimino's party, it was my birthday, and some folks came over here on a Sunday morning and surprised me.

2646
03:05:59,306 --> 03:06:01,267
[SPEAKER_07]: And they all dressed like hoes and pimps.

2647
03:06:01,287 --> 03:06:02,307
[SPEAKER_07]: They brought over cake.

2648
03:06:02,667 --> 03:06:11,550
[SPEAKER_07]: And it was kind of like a Hawaiian Pimps and Hoes party, actually, because they were wearing Hawaiian coconut boobs and little lays, colored rainbow lays and stuff.

2649
03:06:11,570 --> 03:06:12,050
[SPEAKER_07]: And it was fun.

2650
03:06:12,530 --> 03:06:13,690
[SPEAKER_07]: And we had chicken and waffles.

2651
03:06:14,310 --> 03:06:16,271
[SPEAKER_07]: We had Eggos and Popeye's chicken.

2652
03:06:17,611 --> 03:06:20,392
[SPEAKER_15]: By the way, live on the webcam, the ferret eats Loki's head.

2653
03:06:20,512 --> 03:06:20,872
[SPEAKER_07]: Hooray.

2654
03:06:23,317 --> 03:06:24,677
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright guys, guess what?

2655
03:06:24,717 --> 03:06:27,418
[SPEAKER_07]: It's time to wrap up the show.

2656
03:06:28,558 --> 03:06:33,359
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank God this week's show went okay, unlike last week's show, which we're writing off and forgetting about forever.

2657
03:06:33,719 --> 03:06:36,960
[SPEAKER_07]: It's time for me to go around and collect the final thoughts.

2658
03:06:37,360 --> 03:06:38,460
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's start with Bradley.

2659
03:06:39,140 --> 03:06:40,081
[SPEAKER_07]: Does he have a microphone over there?

2660
03:06:41,301 --> 03:06:41,641
[SPEAKER_07]: Jamie.

2661
03:06:45,382 --> 03:06:46,902
[SPEAKER_08]: Have you ever really looked at your toes?

2662
03:06:47,122 --> 03:06:47,902
[SPEAKER_08]: They look weird.

2663
03:06:48,983 --> 03:06:49,543
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, they do.

2664
03:06:50,463 --> 03:06:51,043
[SPEAKER_08]: They do look weird.

2665
03:06:53,843 --> 03:06:56,144
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not Asian, and I don't know how to use chopsticks.

2666
03:06:56,885 --> 03:06:57,565
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Puppy.

2667
03:06:58,106 --> 03:06:58,366
[SPEAKER_08]: Erin.

2668
03:06:59,626 --> 03:07:03,829
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, thanks to me, Puppy has now learned how to pick up Mike and Ike candies with his chopsticks.

2669
03:07:04,669 --> 03:07:05,670
[SPEAKER_08]: But I'm still not Asian.

2670
03:07:06,691 --> 03:07:10,333
[SPEAKER_10]: We realize that, but now you're one step closer to being Asian!

2671
03:07:10,453 --> 03:07:10,933
[SPEAKER_10]: Woohoo!

2672
03:07:11,734 --> 03:07:17,177
[SPEAKER_13]: I actually like that one.

2673
03:07:18,177 --> 03:07:19,398
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki, your final thought.

2674
03:07:19,698 --> 03:07:20,459
[SPEAKER_07]: I solder.

2675
03:07:25,347 --> 03:07:25,648
[SPEAKER_07]: Great.

2676
03:07:27,412 --> 03:07:34,688
[SPEAKER_07]: My final thought is I hope I don't decide to flake on the show next week because the Castro Street Fair does sound tempting.

2677
03:07:36,058 --> 03:07:37,779
[SPEAKER_07]: What, on Sunday?

2678
03:07:38,019 --> 03:07:38,239
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

2679
03:07:38,940 --> 03:07:40,341
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm thinking about flaking on the show, but I don't know.

2680
03:07:40,361 --> 03:07:41,722
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't worry, I'll fill in your part.

2681
03:07:42,102 --> 03:07:42,442
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll see.

2682
03:07:43,002 --> 03:07:43,323
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll see.

2683
03:07:43,663 --> 03:07:44,964
[SPEAKER_07]: I can... We'll see.

2684
03:07:45,104 --> 03:07:47,645
[SPEAKER_07]: I can fill in all your parts on the show.

2685
03:07:47,925 --> 03:07:48,326
[SPEAKER_07]: Whoa!

2686
03:07:48,386 --> 03:07:48,686
[SPEAKER_07]: Whoa!

2687
03:07:49,026 --> 03:07:49,426
[SPEAKER_07]: Whoa!

2688
03:07:50,527 --> 03:07:50,927
[SPEAKER_07]: No!

2689
03:07:50,987 --> 03:07:53,109
[SPEAKER_07]: All your voice parts, you retard!

2690
03:07:53,209 --> 03:07:54,690
[SPEAKER_07]: Freaking... I don't need that.

2691
03:07:55,150 --> 03:07:57,011
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the other Matt that wants to fill those parts.

2692
03:07:57,211 --> 03:07:57,811
[SPEAKER_07]: Whoa!

2693
03:07:58,932 --> 03:08:01,174
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, Holly says, puppy needs to do a hula dance.

2694
03:08:01,194 --> 03:08:01,634
[SPEAKER_07]: Ice Princess.

2695
03:08:01,654 --> 03:08:02,554
[SPEAKER_10]: I say no.

2696
03:08:07,670 --> 03:08:08,791
[SPEAKER_07]: Jamie, your final thought?

2697
03:08:09,631 --> 03:08:11,813
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm having way too much fun with the webcam.

2698
03:08:13,654 --> 03:08:19,256
[SPEAKER_07]: The final word of the show, I'm going to give it to Bradley because he never talks and I want him to give the final word tonight.

2699
03:08:19,877 --> 03:08:20,717
[SPEAKER_07]: Terraforming.

2700
03:08:22,663 --> 03:08:25,044
[SPEAKER_07]: You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

2701
03:08:25,484 --> 03:08:29,386
[SPEAKER_07]: Orange Lounge Radio is hosted by DarkSakura, Sky, and Loki.

2702
03:08:29,767 --> 03:08:31,627
[SPEAKER_07]: We expect you a nice play again.

2703
03:08:32,108 --> 03:08:34,909
[SPEAKER_07]: And now, here's your fortune cookie message of the day.

2704
03:08:35,830 --> 03:08:36,250
[SPEAKER_05]: Pardon me.

2705
03:08:37,110 --> 03:08:37,791
[SPEAKER_02]: Now it begins.

2706
03:08:38,291 --> 03:08:39,792
[SPEAKER_02]: Who all here is evil?

2707
03:08:39,912 --> 03:08:40,472
[SPEAKER_02]: Sound off!

2708
03:08:40,892 --> 03:08:41,752
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm evil.

2709
03:08:42,053 --> 03:08:42,733
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm evil!

2710
03:08:42,933 --> 03:08:43,974
[SPEAKER_04]: No, you are not.

2711
03:08:44,354 --> 03:08:45,935
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I am too!

2712
03:08:46,155 --> 03:08:48,576
[SPEAKER_04]: You're as harmless as a baby's...

2713
03:08:50,853 --> 03:08:51,454
[SPEAKER_04]: Zorak?

2714
03:08:51,634 --> 03:08:52,395
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, he is.

2715
03:08:52,715 --> 03:08:54,136
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not a baby's butt.

2716
03:08:54,316 --> 03:08:57,599
[SPEAKER_02]: Brack, I'm going to have to go with Zorak on this one.

2717
03:08:57,859 --> 03:09:01,041
[SPEAKER_02]: You simply don't have the mental capacity to be evil.

2718
03:09:01,402 --> 03:09:01,982
[SPEAKER_02]: See?

2719
03:09:02,282 --> 03:09:03,223
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't get it.

2720
03:09:03,363 --> 03:09:07,406
[SPEAKER_02]: You see, Brack, you have to be able to come up with, oh, say, plots against the universe.

2721
03:09:07,586 --> 03:09:12,330
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to hatch evil plans to conquer planets and be just plain mean most of the time.

2722
03:09:12,650 --> 03:09:14,792
[SPEAKER_04]: You're just too nice.

2723
03:09:15,152 --> 03:09:16,653
[SPEAKER_03]: I forget how to be mean.

2724
03:09:16,693 --> 03:09:19,574
[SPEAKER_02]: That radiation half-lobotomized me.

2725
03:09:19,634 --> 03:09:21,655
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, I've got an idea.

2726
03:09:22,375 --> 03:09:25,617
[SPEAKER_02]: Let Zorak teach you how to be mean.

2727
03:09:26,017 --> 03:09:26,797
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, man.

2728
03:09:27,317 --> 03:09:28,218
[SPEAKER_04]: Do I have to?

2729
03:09:28,278 --> 03:09:29,859
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, you have to.

2730
03:09:29,999 --> 03:09:30,619
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, Bragg.

2731
03:09:30,939 --> 03:09:31,839
[SPEAKER_04]: Repeat after me.

2732
03:09:32,480 --> 03:09:33,540
[SPEAKER_04]: Space ghost.

2733
03:09:33,560 --> 03:09:34,841
[SPEAKER_04]: Space ghost.

2734
03:09:35,341 --> 03:09:37,222
[SPEAKER_04]: I will destroy you.

2735
03:09:37,522 --> 03:09:40,163
[SPEAKER_03]: I will destroy you, if you don't mind.

2736
03:09:40,583 --> 03:09:42,424
[SPEAKER_04]: I will destroy you.

2737
03:09:42,744 --> 03:09:43,304
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I'm sorry.

2738
03:09:43,345 --> 03:09:44,045
[SPEAKER_03]: Wait, I'll get it.

2739
03:09:44,785 --> 03:09:45,846
[SPEAKER_03]: I will destroy you.

2740
03:09:46,246 --> 03:09:48,508
[SPEAKER_04]: I will destroy you.

2741
03:09:48,528 --> 03:09:51,450
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, I will destroy you.

2742
03:09:51,550 --> 03:09:54,052
[SPEAKER_03]: You and your little dog, too.

2743
03:09:54,212 --> 03:09:56,914
[SPEAKER_03]: You and your little dog.

2744
03:09:56,934 --> 03:10:00,396
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, I like this dog.

2745
03:10:00,697 --> 03:10:02,798
[SPEAKER_03]: Francine is a good puppy.

2746
03:10:02,878 --> 03:10:03,419
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

2747
03:10:04,179 --> 03:10:05,319
[SPEAKER_03]: That was just a prank.

2748
03:10:05,359 --> 03:10:07,380
[SPEAKER_03]: You want to hurt Francine?

2749
03:10:07,800 --> 03:10:12,501
[SPEAKER_03]: You're a big, bad, green, um, thingy guy.

2750
03:10:12,561 --> 03:10:12,981
[SPEAKER_03]: Bug.

2751
03:10:13,121 --> 03:10:16,501
[SPEAKER_03]: Bug, I don't want you to hurt Francine.

2752
03:10:17,041 --> 03:10:19,842
[SPEAKER_03]: Spacecoach, shoot that thingy thing on your arm.

2753
03:10:19,882 --> 03:10:21,322
[SPEAKER_02]: Destructo Ray.

2754
03:10:21,342 --> 03:10:24,563
[SPEAKER_03]: Destructo Ray so he doesn't hurt Francine.

2755
03:10:24,603 --> 03:10:25,463
[SPEAKER_03]: Gladly, Brack.

2756
03:10:25,663 --> 03:10:27,063
[SPEAKER_02]: My dear old chum.

2757
03:10:30,204 --> 03:10:30,744
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey!

2758
03:10:31,525 --> 03:10:32,986
[SPEAKER_02]: What'd you do that for?

2759
03:10:33,346 --> 03:10:35,707
[SPEAKER_02]: That was for Francine!

2760
03:10:36,848 --> 03:10:37,909
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, wait, I don't have a dog.

2761
03:10:38,189 --> 03:10:40,190
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

2762
03:10:40,230 --> 03:10:41,331
[SPEAKER_04]: Tell me about it.

2763
03:10:45,233 --> 03:10:47,354
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for listening, and we'll see you next week.

2764
03:11:17,464 --> 03:11:17,884
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

2765
03:11:17,944 --> 03:11:19,546
[SPEAKER_07]: We're in the Orange Launch Radio after birth.

2766
03:11:19,646 --> 03:11:21,527
[SPEAKER_07]: As promised, we won't make you wait any longer.

2767
03:11:21,587 --> 03:11:22,588
[SPEAKER_07]: Here it is one more time.

2768
03:11:22,989 --> 03:11:23,469
[SPEAKER_07]: Overloaded.

2769
03:11:23,929 --> 03:11:24,370
[SPEAKER_07]: Lesson two.

2770
03:13:07,893 --> 03:13:12,918
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, we're going to be adding that song into a rotation, by the way, on Orange Lounge Radio's Bomani Music and More program.

2771
03:13:12,938 --> 03:13:16,802
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you like that and can't get enough of it, don't worry, you'll get to hear more very soon.

2772
03:13:17,562 --> 03:13:19,404
[SPEAKER_07]: Welcome to the Orange Lounge Radio Afterbirth.

2773
03:13:20,325 --> 03:13:23,248
[SPEAKER_07]: You are a scary woman, Miss Erin, with your whip.

2774
03:13:24,148 --> 03:13:26,130
[SPEAKER_07]: When's going to be another tournament where you can beat me up?

2775
03:13:28,012 --> 03:13:28,753
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know, there hasn't...

2776
03:13:29,670 --> 03:13:33,833
[SPEAKER_32]: Well, if you have to choose any time soon, she'll probably end up being there, so I'll try her there.

2777
03:13:34,274 --> 03:13:34,874
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, probably.

2778
03:13:34,914 --> 03:13:40,458
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, see, the thing is, there haven't been any real good NorCal tournaments coming out.

2779
03:13:40,498 --> 03:13:51,547
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, after the last year barrage of tournaments, it was kind of tired out, and now it's just, well... I'm kind of sad that I heard about the tournament in Nickel City today.

2780
03:13:51,927 --> 03:13:54,609
[SPEAKER_07]: They were having a Puzzle Fire tournament, and only one person showed up.

2781
03:13:55,370 --> 03:13:55,850
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, man.

2782
03:13:55,910 --> 03:13:56,731
[SPEAKER_07]: I played him today and beat him.

2783
03:13:58,432 --> 03:13:59,333
[SPEAKER_22]: No, did you go?

2784
03:13:59,870 --> 03:14:03,612
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I played, you know, what's his name that was going to be there?

2785
03:14:04,312 --> 03:14:05,053
[SPEAKER_07]: I forget his name.

2786
03:14:06,213 --> 03:14:09,535
[SPEAKER_07]: But anyways, yeah, so we played him and I won.

2787
03:14:10,115 --> 03:14:11,516
[SPEAKER_07]: Because he made a mistake.

2788
03:14:12,737 --> 03:14:16,719
[SPEAKER_07]: But it was, I don't know, I think it would have been cool to have a Puzzle Fighter tournament.

2789
03:14:16,759 --> 03:14:21,861
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I know people in the Bay Area are pretty hardcore in that stuff.

2790
03:14:21,941 --> 03:14:24,903
[SPEAKER_07]: But I don't know how a DDR tournament is going to work out too well there.

2791
03:14:27,610 --> 03:14:27,991
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

2792
03:14:28,471 --> 03:14:30,333
[SPEAKER_07]: Anything else we want to share on the afterbirth?

2793
03:14:30,573 --> 03:14:31,454
[SPEAKER_07]: Jamie, have anything?

2794
03:14:34,698 --> 03:14:38,141
[SPEAKER_07]: Go to www.fanamatrix.net.

2795
03:14:38,241 --> 03:14:39,062
[SPEAKER_07]: They have a pretty cool...

2796
03:14:41,335 --> 03:14:42,357
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, go to BitTorrent.

2797
03:14:42,377 --> 03:14:43,318
[SPEAKER_07]: They have BitTorrent links.

2798
03:14:44,620 --> 03:14:47,724
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyways, they have BitTorrent links for the movie.

2799
03:14:48,105 --> 03:14:55,915
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a 10-minute or about 10-minute fan film that's done by professional actors, professional stuntmen, special effects and whatnot, cinematography.

2800
03:14:55,975 --> 03:14:57,618
[SPEAKER_07]: There's kind of like a practice movie for them.

2801
03:14:58,218 --> 03:15:26,377
[SPEAKER_07]: and no fan movie and it's basically a bunch of New Zealand actors you know doing this kind of prequel to The Matrix and it's pretty sweet so you should go check that out they're talking about doing sequels and stuff later on but it's the first movie is called Phantom Matrix and it's called Run Program and it's pretty cool so that's www.phantomatrix.net and yeah

2802
03:15:29,335 --> 03:15:34,224
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, I think that's going to wrap up the afterbirth, unless anyone else has something they want to say?

2803
03:15:34,344 --> 03:15:35,586
[SPEAKER_07]: I will destroy you!

2804
03:15:36,027 --> 03:15:36,468
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

2805
03:15:36,568 --> 03:15:37,530
[SPEAKER_07]: Jamie, come in.

2806
03:15:37,750 --> 03:15:40,755
[SPEAKER_15]: I've got lint in my eye and it hurts.

2807
03:15:41,417 --> 03:15:41,817
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, bye.

2808
03:15:43,041 --> 03:15:44,162
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, until next week.

2809
03:15:44,202 --> 03:15:44,602
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks, you guys.

2810
03:15:44,682 --> 03:15:48,706
[SPEAKER_07]: As I promised way in the beginning of the show, we're going to do the Night Style soundtrack.

2811
03:15:48,966 --> 03:15:52,289
[SPEAKER_07]: Just a random order, you guys, so hopefully the song you want will come up soon.

2812
03:15:54,871 --> 03:15:55,712
[SPEAKER_07]: Good night, you guys.

2813
03:15:56,132 --> 03:15:58,074
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for supporting Orange Lounge Radio as always.

2814
03:15:58,114 --> 03:15:58,875
[SPEAKER_07]: We really appreciate it.

2815
03:15:58,915 --> 03:16:00,076
[SPEAKER_07]: We'd be nothing without you.

2816
03:16:07,660 --> 03:16:08,441
Thanks for watching!

2817
03:17:18,200 --> 03:17:19,005
Thanks for watching!

2818
03:18:49,218 --> 03:18:51,888
Come on baby, move it up, now you're home to get your magic shot.

2819
03:19:22,702 --> 03:19:24,203
I gotta give it to you tonight

2820
03:19:53,061 --> 03:19:53,942
Listen to my heartbeat

2821
03:21:46,412 --> 03:21:47,877
I'm leading a new evolution.

2822
03:22:38,649 --> 03:22:39,512
Thanks for watching!

2823
03:23:06,289 --> 03:23:07,089
Thank you for watching!

2824
03:23:52,853 --> 03:23:53,561
