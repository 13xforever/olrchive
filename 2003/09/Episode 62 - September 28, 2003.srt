1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,500
Synchronize as love is what we've got to do

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:07,000
All the time we'll be together

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,500
Cause it's yours and mine forever

4
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:13,000
We're in this love team

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I won't be a man

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
So tonight we're gonna live the night away

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
One and one is two

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Don't you be so cruel

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Synchronize as love is what we've got to do

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,360
All the time we'll be together

11
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:33,000
Cause it's yours and mine

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Forever we're in the dark

13
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Turn around

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Look at what you see in her face The mirror of your dreams

15
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Make believe I'm everywhere Give in the light

16
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Isn't all the fadin' The answer to a neverending story

17
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Reach the stars, light a fantasy Dream a dream, and what you see will be

18
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
To keep their secrets

19
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
When I go behind the clouds

20
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
And there upon the rainbow

21
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
They'll give me the answer to

22
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:13,000
A never-ending story

23
00:02:43,000 --> 00:03:08,400
When you shun your fear, for she may fade away

24
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,400
in your hands

25
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:15,400
the birth of a new day

26
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:19,400
the mind could keep their secret

27
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:23,400
they'll fall behind a pound

28
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:27,400
and therefore the reign of peace

29
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:35,000
In the answer to a never-ending story

30
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:42,600
Never-ending story

31
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:50,600
Never-ending story

32
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,600
Yeah

33
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,600
Hey

34
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,600
And you can take away

35
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,200
Oh, kurau kou kou kou malerika

36
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:26,200
Waku malakiru

37
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:29,200
But I'm not your hero, she's a stinker

38
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:58,200
Toto, I have a feeling we're not in Kansas anymore.

39
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:06,520
You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio, the Monty Talk and then some.

40
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:10,120
Uh, mostly the and then some part of that.

41
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:14,760
Orange Lounge Radio is created by a bunch of potty-mouthed adults.

42
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:19,960
Orange Lounge may contain sexual, perverted, and mildly retarded content.

43
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:23,720
You probably shouldn't let your children listen to Orange Lounge Radio.

44
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:25,840
Yes, I will spank your child.

45
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:54,560
If you're not going to do your job, goddammit, I will.

46
00:08:54,560 --> 00:09:01,560
Searching for a boy in high school is useless, but searching for meaning in a poly shoreline.

47
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:06,560
Oh yeah? Well, I hope your babies look like monkeys.

48
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:07,560
Dark Sakura.

49
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:08,560
I've had a sniff.

50
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:09,560
Sky.

51
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:11,560
But I'm playing it for the bartender, so suffer.

52
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:12,560
Loki.

53
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:13,560
I hate you!

54
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:18,560
Orange Lounge Radio.

55

Can opener is in the second drawer down.

60
00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:58,320
Second drawer down, not including the cutting board.

61
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,120
There you go.

62
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:08,080

In that corner, say hello to our Tech Massa Loki.

74
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,800

82
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:55,460

89
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:32,220
And we ripped them ourselves. They're a little amateurish, but they got the job done.

90
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:33,220
Good job!

91
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:39,220

92
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:42,220
Cage match, possibly a list list if we have time for it.

00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:46,220

And Jamie Cooking for all of you out there.

96
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:55,220
She'll be holding it up to the webcam and you can lick your screen.

97
00:12:55,220 --> 00:13:01,220
So to get our webcam address, head on over to our website, www.calibomani.com.

98
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:04,420
click on orange lounge and click on chat

99
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:06,020
and then our chat room will be more than happy

100
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:07,180
to give you the link to the webcam

101
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:08,620
because it's got a really long URL

102
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:10,320
and I don't say it over the air.

103
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,040
All right, we'll be back after this.

104
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:14,620
We're gonna start off with a little bit of ecstasy,

105
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:16,420
bad routine and busy child.

106
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:17,260
We'll be back.

107
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:24,940
A little bit of ecstasy A little bit of you and me

108
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:32,420
A little bit of s grocery free A little bit of ecstasy

109
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:40,120
A little bit of ecstasy A little bit of you and me

110
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:55,120
Tell me that you want me, tell me that you need me

111
00:13:55,120 --> 00:14:03,120
Tell me that you want me, tell me that you love me

112
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:07,120
I'll be your dream

113

I'll be the dream

118
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:38,640
I'll be the dream

119
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:42,640
With my friends and me

120
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:46,640
Ooh, yeah

121
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:49,640
Let the dream come true

122
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:51,640
Let the dream come true

123
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:54,640
Let the beat control your body

124
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:58,640
A little bit of ecstasy

125
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:31,880
Yeah, I hope you love me more than I do

126
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:46,760
Yeah, I hope you love me more than I do

127
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:17,760
Yeah!

128
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:19,260
That's what they call our love.

129
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:21,260
Yeah!

130
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:22,260
Yeah!

131
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:23,260
Oh, oh.

132
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:24,260
Oh, oh.

133
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:25,260
Yeah!

134
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:27,260
Oh!

135
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:28,260
Yeah!

136
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:29,260
Oh!

137
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:30,260
Oh!

138
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:32,260
Oh!

139
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:33,260
Oh!

140
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:53,180
I guess I didn't know I guess I didn't know

141
00:16:53,180 --> 00:17:15,140
Get Busy Time Get Busy Time

142
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:38,300
Please listen to Orange Lounge Radio, because real radio makes Captain Jack cry.

143
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:42,180
Hello and welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 62.

144
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:44,900
And we're playing Max 2 USA MP3s tonight.

145
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:47,860
So in that break you heard a little bit of ecstasy, bad routine, and busy child.

146
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:49,140
We're just going to hit them in alphabetical order.

147
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:52,280
We've got 15 songs to play tonight, five breaks we usually do.

148
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:56,100
So we'll have just enough to put us through the rest of the show.

149
00:18:56,100 --> 00:19:00,140
So speaking of Max 2 USA, it's the big news this week, Wednesday.

150
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:03,260
We haven't had a new DDR game in the USA for over a year.

151
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:06,660
We haven't really seen any new DDR of any kind, unless you live in Europe.

152
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:09,700
You haven't seen any new DDR of any kind since Extreme in January.

153
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:12,060
So this is like big news this week.

154
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:20,540
So, what did you guys think? Best damn home version ever. Why? Because it's got so many

155
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:26,260
licensed tracks that are unique to the game that they actually put some thought into what

156
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:32,140
songs to put in and actually did a good job of it. Well, yeah, but this is better. Max

157
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:39,140
X2 is 20 times better.

158
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:44,260
Any particular favorites?

159
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:49,340
They had Xenon in it and I like pissed my pants when I unlocked it.

160
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:51,740
You didn't spoil, I went and spoiled the list.

161
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:54,380
I went on Wednesday morning and read the whole damn list.

162
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:55,380
I would just want to know.

163
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:57,460
I want to know what the hell was in the game.

164
00:19:57,460 --> 00:20:04,260
I didn't even go online Wednesday until, like, when I was halfway through unlocking it, when

165
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:08,140
I was going to go online and see how far you guys were into it.

166
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:09,140
Yeah.

167
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:11,220
Hopefully you were listening to us on Wednesday.

168
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:12,220
I don't even care.

169
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:14,140
I don't care if it's a spoiler or not.

170
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:15,140
Two words.

171
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:16,140
Tomorrow perfume.

172
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:17,140
That's it.

173
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:19,940
Tomorrow perfume was an excellent choice for an unlock to the game.

174
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:21,100
Yes, it was.

175
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:24,980
I'm going to start off with a bitch, and it's my one bitch about Max 2 USA.

176
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:29,260
Otherwise the game is fucking fabulous, but this is my bitch.

177
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:33,740
Almost one out of every three songs has been in a USA release before, including like half

178
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:34,740
the unlocks.

179
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:39,220
Like when I unlocked Afronova, okay no, when I unlocked Put Your Faith In Me, I about threw

180
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:40,620
a brick through the TV, okay?

181
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:45,100
I was like, if Loki hadn't bought this brand new TV, I would have put a brick through it.

182
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:47,100
Because I was just like, what the hell?

183
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:48,100
Put Your Faith In Me?

184
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:49,100
At least it wasn't a jazzy group.

185
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:53,980
I mean, if you're going to repeat something, repeat a good song.

186
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:59,260
my one bitch otherwise yeah I like the game but I just I felt a little cheated

187
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:03,480
I was like couldn't they have just put another 2d x song in there like if they

188
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:06,520
wanted to put something booty like if they had to have a booty song instead of

189
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:11,120
put your faith in me how about my baby more game oh yes put in my baby mama

190
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:15,960
because I'll tell you one of the coolest things one of the things I freaking love

191
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:21,160
about max to USA is those fourth mix songs conga feeling dream a dream in the

192
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:27,320
Navy, 3rd Mix, 4th Mix, whatever. Those songs have been completely reinvented. The fact

193
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:36,320
that they're in 60 frames a minute, background videos, fucking rule. I'm almost a little

194
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:39,960
disappointed that there weren't more of them. Like I was a little surprised that Heaven

195
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:44,000
didn't have its video. I thought there would be a video for that. Okay, so they probably

196
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,780
had licensing issue problems. Fine. So, you know, give it to them, fine. They probably

197
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:57,940
had to pay a lot more to license the videos. The Days Go By video is pretty cool. I'll

198
00:21:57,940 --> 00:22:03,140
tell you what, favorite video. You know how many songs actually have music videos though?

199
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:08,780
If you do the counting, six. I think it's only six. It's the two Captain Jack songs,

200
00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:22,020
Conga Feelin', Whistle Song, Love at First Sight, Days Go By, and Four Strings, oh maybe

201
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:30,340
there was eight because that's seven I just named. Four Strings has a video that has the

202
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:36,300
trains in it and the green wall. Nobody knew what video it was when you saw it. Oh yeah,

203
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:38,300
You have to just look at the Four Strings video.

204
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:40,300
The steps to that song are really good.

205
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:42,300
You know how everybody thought?

206
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:49,300
You remember when the early early pictures of Max 2 came out and they had the trains

207
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:51,300
and everybody said it was Chemical Brothers Star Guitar?

208
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:53,300
It was actually the Four Strings video.

209
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:56,300
Yeah, whatever.

210
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:59,300
I was done with that game in one hour.

211
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:01,300
I was just like, eh, I'm over it.

212
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:03,300
You know what though?

213
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:06,540
We had like a working dance pad in here right now, I think I'd still be playing it every

214
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:07,540
day for exercise.

215
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:08,540
Oh yeah, doubles?

216
00:23:08,540 --> 00:23:09,540
Awesome.

217
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:16,580
My ignition pad, mine, that I got as an alimony payment.

218
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:21,260
Yeah, so we've heard about that pad so many times already, we don't need to hear it again.

219
00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:22,820
You're right, we don't need to hear it again.

220
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:27,940
But just the random old non-stop is keeping me playing it every day.

221
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:30,500
You know what, if I had a dance pad to play it on, not just a controller, I'd be playing

222
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:31,500
it every day too.

223
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:35,360
You know what's weird is I think between this, and I'm going to get into this later, between

224
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:41,920
this and RVGL's recent turnaround, I'm like totally into DDR again, it's scary.

225
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:47,160
Except for the whole wobbly pad thing on Xtreme and RVGL, I played one game on it and I was

226
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:50,680
like E. Other comments on Max2?

227
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:52,720
You haven't been able to play it yet, Aaron, right?

228
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:56,640
Hopefully during a break we'll be able to sneak it on so you can see it.

229
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:57,640
Favorite video?

230
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:58,640
Puppy.

231
00:23:58,640 --> 00:23:59,640
Favorite video?

232
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:07,760
Let's see, I have to go with in the Navy video.

233
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:14,160
I would say it's a tie, because I love Conga Feelin, I love Vivian, she's a fat Shakira,

234
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:15,700
I love her.

235
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:20,620
But Dream of Dream is so cool too, like the flying car and the lucky rocks.

236
00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:23,200
There's a flying car in the Dream of Dream video, it's awesome.

237
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:27,120
I think I have to say Conga Feelin though, because like, they change, one thing you may

238
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:30,800
not know if you haven't picked up Max 2 USA yet, they changed all the backgrounds for

239
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:34,720
the 4th mix and before songs that have videos. So Conga Feelin, Dream of Dream, they all

240
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:38,800
have new backgrounds that are stills from the music video. The Dream of Dream background

241
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:45,560
is the best DVR background ever. But the Conga Feelin video is like this shot of Vivian and

242
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:50,240
she has like her mouth open and her eyes squinty. It looks scary. I think it's a throwback to

243
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:54,760
the original 4th Plus video, which was the girl with her mouth open, but the way they

244
00:24:54,760 --> 00:25:00,900
got the freeze-frame in the video, it looks like a cum shot.

245
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:04,220
Like hug a feeling, because Vivian's got her mouth open, she's like, oh yeah baby!

246
00:25:04,220 --> 00:25:07,060
What about Captain Jack's background for Dream of a Dream?

247
00:25:07,060 --> 00:25:08,060
Dream of a Dream was awesome.

248
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:19,540
He's just like, scary monster man, shittiest background, shittiest new background, beloved

249
00:25:19,540 --> 00:25:25,020
first sight video scary I would say I don't want to watch the whole thing

250
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:29,620
this background is days go by I'm sorry I don't because that shot of the guys in

251
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:33,340
the car they like keep showing that in the video they're actually it's because

252
00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:37,980
they're the singers well you can't really see the see it very much because

253
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:42,840
the videos are so low-res but they're actually singing the song in the

254
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:47,780
background well it's not I don't like that that's a video though that I need

255
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:53,600
to get the whole thing of the because yeah that's the worst video but no but

256
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:57,380
no for days go by though the whole video I really want to see it because it's

257
00:25:57,380 --> 00:26:00,460
supposed to be like I actually have a whole story to it why is it oh yeah it

258
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:05,820
has subtitles to which somehow I think they totally edited the max to USA one

259
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:09,060
because it has no subtitles so I think they totally picked pick and chose

260
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:11,860
different clips because if you notice if you watch the Kylie video they had to

261
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:14,860
edit that too because they have to edit it to go with the edited song I think

262
00:26:14,860 --> 00:26:20,860
I think it also turned into widescreen on the Max 2 background video.

263
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:22,860
I didn't pay that close attention, unfortunately.

264
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:28,860
I thought they changed the ratio so that it wouldn't show where the actual subtitles would have been.

265
00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:30,860
Maybe. They may have done something like that.

266
00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:37,860

267
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:39,860
We'll be playing Max 2 USA MP3s throughout the evening.

268
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:43,860
We also have the three brand new songs in DDR.

269
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:46,660
my next question what you guys think of the brand brand new songs have never

270
00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:50,300
been in DDR I'm sorry that have never been in the Konami originals have not

271
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:56,440
been in any game yet like forever sunshine and all that stuff fun forever

272
00:26:56,440 --> 00:27:02,500
sunshine came out of my ass equally brown goo that's what that song was we

273
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:06,860
found a singer that sings worse than Paul Atari we didn't think it was

274
00:27:06,860 --> 00:27:15,060
I love you has the chick from let them move singing and it's actually a really damn good

275
00:27:15,060 --> 00:27:16,060
song.

276
00:27:16,060 --> 00:27:17,060
Yeah it is.

277
00:27:17,060 --> 00:27:21,500
The first time I heard it it was like eh but it started to grow on me.

278
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:26,380
Forever sunshine is awful it has miss piggy singing it is what we were saying on wednesday

279
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:27,380
you know.

280
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:41,340
I wish they would have taken that one new song from Lesson Mode and actually put that

281
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:42,340
into the game.

282
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:45,740
The biggest letdown is not having that song in the game as a playable song.

283
00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:47,260
That's one we didn't rip.

284
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:48,260
We should have played...

285
00:27:48,260 --> 00:27:49,740
Oh, that's one thing we got to do.

286
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:55,880
I actually just played through that whole section of Lesson Mode just so I could play

287
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:30,780
busy stuff. They all do their own dance so it's really stupid looking.

288
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:33,740
Sometimes they'll do the same dance with the same type.

289
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:37,560
Did you like the dancers overall, Jamie? Did you think it was a good feature?

290
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:39,760
They were all cleaned up and cel shaded. They were really nice.

291
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:43,920
The characters looked gorgeous. Cel shaded rage is fucking pimp.

292
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:46,400
Do you think they totally stole that idea from StepMania though?

293
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:50,500
They could have, but StepMania isn't cel shaded.

294
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:54,240
You know what? They did it better in the USDR I gotta say. But I'll tell you what, the best

295
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:58,240
The best thing about those characters is when you get extra stage playing Max and the Light.

296
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:00,240
Oh my God, there's seizures!

297
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:02,240
It's funny. It's so funny.

298
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:06,240
It's like, hello, seizures. It's crazy.

299
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:11,240
23rd Magus says in the chatroom, the best song in the game was the Midnight Blaze remix in the menus.

300
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:15,240
That was an awesome mix. Again, kind of a disappointment that that wasn't there.

301
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:16,240
Was that the same one from Beaver?

302
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:18,240
I'm not sure, I guess.

303
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:20,240
I hate System SF.

304
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:22,240
I know you hate System SF, but we'll get into it later.

305
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:27,320
It was actually kind of hard, and it was fun, and I liked it.

306
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:29,160
We're going to have that next week.

307
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:33,380
Next week, we're going to have the US v. Rare 2, Jamie has it, and she's going to bring

308
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:36,960
it next week for us.

309
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:40,320
After the show tonight, by the way, Night Style, original soundtrack, we're going to

310
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:43,440
play it for you guys, because we've been playing bits and pieces for you guys throughout the

311
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:45,820
week, but I know most of you guys listen to tonight's show, so...

312
00:29:45,820 --> 00:29:49,220
Didn't it go up on MGZ?

313
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:50,220
The first disc?

314
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:51,900
I don't know, we had the whole thing.

315
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:54,900
We got it through a different source.

316
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:57,980
One of our studio regulars got it for us.

317
00:29:57,980 --> 00:29:58,980
It's okay.

318
00:29:58,980 --> 00:29:59,980
Yep.

319
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:02,300
I only need to get a copy then.

320
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:05,140
I can't copy tonight, but I can get it for you during the week.

321
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:06,140
Anyway.

322
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:07,140
Anybody else want a microphone now?

323
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:08,140
Yeah.

324
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:09,140
Anyone else want to comment on Max 2?

325
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:10,140
Loki?

326
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:11,140
I've never played it.

327
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:12,140
Bradley?

328
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:13,140
I know you haven't played it.

329
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:14,140
Bradley, you have anything you want to say on Max 2?

330
00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:15,140
I know you got a little bit out on Wednesday, but...

331
00:30:15,140 --> 00:30:16,140
Jamie!

332
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:17,780
What do you have to say about Max 2?

333
00:30:17,780 --> 00:30:18,780
She's cooking.

334
00:30:18,780 --> 00:30:19,780
She's cooking.

335
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:20,780
So I'm like stuck with a microphone?

336
00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:21,780
Yeah.

337
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:23,780
What else is there to talk about with Max 2?

338
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:30,780
I'm actually glad they took out OE's and replaced them with non-stops, because non-stops are much better.

339
00:30:30,780 --> 00:30:32,780
Jason Enos is brilliant.

340
00:30:32,780 --> 00:30:33,780
Yes, thank you.

341
00:30:33,780 --> 00:30:35,780
Thank you, that's why I forgot.

342
00:30:35,780 --> 00:30:40,780
The information screen is like the best part of the unlocks, completely.

343
00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:42,780
It is so hilarious.

344
00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:46,780
Supposedly, the rumor is Jason Enos wrote all those himself.

345
00:30:46,780 --> 00:30:50,780
I mean, we know he did for Max, so we kind of assume he did for Max 2.

346
00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:55,780
Who knows, but those things were the funniest damn things I've ever read.

347
00:30:55,780 --> 00:30:57,780
You know what, and there's one for every damn song in the game.

348
00:30:57,780 --> 00:31:06,780
Yes, and they're funny. Some of them are kind of generic, but some of the ones that use the worst puns ever are so great.

349
00:31:06,780 --> 00:31:14,780
Honestly, that was part of the unlocking for me, was just getting to do the bad puns.

350
00:31:14,780 --> 00:31:16,780
Yes, Jamie?

351
00:31:16,780 --> 00:31:21,020
I didn't get a chance to check it out because I've been kind of busy but I'm going to be

352
00:31:21,020 --> 00:31:25,260
using the workout mode in the game and it looks like it was tweaked a little bit.

353
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:26,980
Have you looked at workout mode?

354
00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:27,980
They did change it.

355
00:31:27,980 --> 00:31:28,980
They did.

356
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:29,980
I was not able to find non-stops though.

357
00:31:29,980 --> 00:31:33,500
I heard a rumor that non-stops were in workout mode.

358
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:35,500
We couldn't find them.

359
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:38,980
Oh, maybe that's what we did wrong.

360
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:43,000
Well, I'll tell you what though, they totally changed the interface.

361
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,900
The interface in workout mode looks better than in the end game.

362
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:50,460
it has like the stars and the flashing red background yeah it's pretty it's

363
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:56,420
very pretty I know it's pretty it's got the little spiral swirly thing and it

364
00:31:56,420 --> 00:32:00,460
makes it look cool I kind of like how max to USA feels a little bit like a

365
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:03,700
hybrid of max to an extreme like with all the extreme videos being in there

366
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:08,100
and stuff but what's interesting is that when October 9th that we're only like

367
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:11,900
two weeks away from it we're gonna be seeing the Japanese version of extreme

368
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:14,380
and we here at orange on radio course will be getting that we're gonna do

369
00:32:14,380 --> 00:32:17,140
Another big promo for that one.

370
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:20,580
Yeah, but the problem is, we don't know what day we're going to get it.

371
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:22,620
You may not get it for like three weeks after it's released.

372
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:25,820
Well, we're hoping we're going to get it within days of its release.

373
00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:33,220
It could be, it'll be like a Wednesday or a Thursday, we think.

374
00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:34,180
So.

375
00:32:34,180 --> 00:32:35,540
Which means it'd be in the middle of the week,

376
00:32:35,540 --> 00:32:37,220
which means I can't come out and do.

377
00:32:37,220 --> 00:32:38,700
Which is fine, because Wednesday and

378
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:40,900
Thursday is kind of open on Orange on Twitter right now,

379
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:46,220
with Livewar being on hiatus and everything so yeah look you'll get into

380
00:32:46,220 --> 00:32:52,740
that later why Livewar is on her hiatus for the well um DR extreme Japan it's

381
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:57,420
kind of like wow it's gonna be interesting because max to USA for once

382
00:32:57,420 --> 00:33:01,220
it's like it's taken a lot of the good things before the Japanese can do it

383
00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:06,460
yeah we actually beat them two things and there's self-shading characters the

384
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:07,460
Some of the songs.

385
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:08,460
Background movies.

386
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:09,460
Some of the songs.

387
00:33:09,460 --> 00:33:10,460
Background movies.

388
00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:14,620
Although if you heard this, this is kind of news that came out this week, DDR Party Edition,

389
00:33:14,620 --> 00:33:16,500
the one that's going to come out after Extreme.

390
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:20,060
I don't know if it's the end of the year or first quarter next year, but it's kind of

391
00:33:20,060 --> 00:33:24,380
going to be a best hits too, basically, but it's going to use music videos.

392
00:33:24,380 --> 00:33:25,380
And it's been confirmed-

393
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:26,380
That could be interesting.

394
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:28,620
It's been confirmed that Conga Field is going to have its videos, so who knows what other

395
00:33:28,620 --> 00:33:29,620
videos we're going to get now.

396
00:33:29,620 --> 00:33:32,380
Probably the same four we have in Max 2 USA.

397
00:33:32,380 --> 00:33:35,820
Could we get Butterfly's video, because Butterfly has been confirmed in the mix.

398
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:47,820
Okay. No. Just no. That's frightening. And whose phone is ringing? I hear a tone.

399
00:33:47,820 --> 00:34:01,820
Bad song in that mix. Spice Girls Wannabe is going to be in DDR Party. It has two new songs. One of them is a B4U song and the other one is Spice Girls.

400
00:34:01,820 --> 00:34:05,820
Because it's in the new euro, it's in the new euro game.

401
00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:11,820
Fuck the Spice Girls! Fuck them! Fuck their music!

402
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:17,820
Why do they have to prolong their song's life?

403
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:24,820
And of course, people are spreading rumors that the Korean songs will finally make their debut in Party. I doubt it too.

404
00:34:24,820 --> 00:34:29,820
Never gonna happen, stop wanting those old pieces of shit songs.

405
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:30,820
They suck.

406
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:35,740
If they were so good, they would have brought them back.

407
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:36,740
But they suck.

408
00:34:36,740 --> 00:34:41,180
It was a Korean game in the first place.

409
00:34:41,180 --> 00:34:42,180
Get over it.

410
00:34:42,180 --> 00:34:43,180
Face sucks.

411
00:34:43,180 --> 00:34:46,740
I will give you that, but back row.

412
00:34:46,740 --> 00:34:48,540
What's the one wherever you go?

413
00:34:48,540 --> 00:34:49,540
What's the slow one?

414
00:34:49,540 --> 00:34:50,540
Bueul.

415
00:34:50,540 --> 00:34:51,540
Bueul.

416
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:52,540
Bueul sucks.

417
00:34:52,540 --> 00:34:57,180
But like, wah, bakwah, song-suk, mask time.

418
00:34:57,180 --> 00:34:59,280
Yes.

419
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:05,080
One of the Sacramento regulars had a routine to be a little it was pretty cool.

420
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:12,160
Anyway Holly is posting parody lyrics to Wannabe.

421
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:15,160
If you want to be my butter, you got to spread on my bread.

422
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:16,160
That's cute.

423
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:17,160
That's very cute.

424
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:18,160
Yeah.

425
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:22,880
Tell me, tell me, have like the funnest trick double steps ever.

426
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:24,160
I don't do trick doubles.

427
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:25,160
Thank you.

428
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:26,160
Star Yan.

429
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:28,160
That's the worst Double Step.

430
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:49,160
Nope.

431
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:50,160
I don't think it'll happen.

432
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:55,160
We need bass solo songs.

433
00:35:55,160 --> 00:36:00,160
So, Extreme will be out in a few weeks and there's a couple new tracks in Extreme. It'll be fun.

434
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:03,160
Like, A Stupid Barber.

435
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:05,160
A Stupid Barber has been confirmed.

436
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:06,160
What the hell is that song?

437
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:13,160
It's by Soda. It's by the same one who did one of the songs.

438
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:14,160
Do It Right.

439
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:15,160
Is it Do It Right?

440
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:16,160
Yeah.

441
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:19,160
It's also one of the songs in Max 2 USA.

442
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:28,720
It's one of the Hidden Max 2 USA songs too. I just can't think of the name. I'm looking

443
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:32,660
it up right now. I Need You. That one. I Need You was by him too.

444
00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:42,700
Was it piano in the background? Oh. Oh. That one was, right, whatever.

445
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:47,700
So, um, okay, so what's this, what's this that you're going to play for us, Logie?

446
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:51,940
This is the track that was in the lesson mode in X2.

447
00:36:51,940 --> 00:36:58,940
I think, I heard it, I heard it, it called Overloaded, alright let's hear it.

448
00:38:21,940 --> 00:38:44,220
All right, that is Lesson Two, we're calling it for now, or it might be Overloaded, because

449
00:38:44,220 --> 00:38:45,540
that's the one lyric in it.

450
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:50,140
But that is Lesson Two in Max2USAC, if you want to listen to it, that's the song you

451
00:38:50,140 --> 00:38:51,140
have.

452
00:38:51,140 --> 00:38:57,620
and what if that's a stupid barber that would be no just no I doubt it but that

453
00:38:57,620 --> 00:39:02,260
would be cool well here's the other thing though it's one of the things we

454
00:39:02,260 --> 00:39:08,380
can look at since pretty much you can guarantee extreme the party mix max to

455
00:39:08,380 --> 00:39:14,380
USA and dancing stage fever are whatever their one is gonna be called now that

456
00:39:14,380 --> 00:39:18,220
I don't know if it's fever or not but anyways they're all sharing the same

457
00:39:18,220 --> 00:39:22,960
song list that was in max 2 so you pretty much eliminate all the songs

458
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:26,080
have been confirmed for the other games and you're left with what's an extreme

459
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:31,720
which one of them is max period probably another max max period the problem is is

460
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:36,040
if that appears in DDR extreme it's going to be pretty much guaranteeing

461
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:41,920
that that's going to be DDR extreme was the last arcade version because they

462
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:48,800
never released maxes on the home versions at all so that'd be my guess I

463
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:52,600
I'm gonna go out on a limb here and I know Loki's gonna yell at me for it but

464
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:55,960
I think max period is a red herring I don't think it means anything I think

465
00:39:55,960 --> 00:40:00,880
it'll be it'll be nothing I don't think it's gonna be a song but I would love to

466
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:08,500
be proven wrong mine didn't break I didn't I don't even remember when it

467
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:20,700
broke. Maybe that song was max period. Oh my gods. Okay, we're going to take a break.

468
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:25,260
We're going to play some more Max2USA stuff. When we come back, we're going to finish up

469
00:40:25,260 --> 00:40:30,260
any talk on Max2USA. We're going to talk a bit about some other games and some other

470
00:40:30,260 --> 00:40:34,940
arcades in town. We're going to talk about 2DX as well when we come back. After this

471
00:40:34,940 --> 00:40:39,380
a group of Max 2 USA MP3s are going to hear in this break start off with Days Go By. And

472
00:40:39,380 --> 00:40:41,500
you're going to hear Forever Sunshine in this break, too.

473
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:42,500
No!

474
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:47,860
No! God, no. It's only a minute and 28 seconds, but I feel an obligation to our listeners

475
00:40:47,860 --> 00:40:51,740
who haven't been able to hear it yet. They can say they've heard it, so here it is.

476
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:53,580
Do you really want to scare the crap out of them?

477
00:40:53,580 --> 00:40:58,100
That's okay, because after that we get one of the coolest 70s songs ever, Get Down Tonight.

478
00:40:58,100 --> 00:40:59,180
Do a little dance.

479
00:40:59,180 --> 00:41:03,780
You know what? You know what? People don't need to buy laxatives anymore, because all

480
00:41:03,780 --> 00:41:07,780
All we have to do is listen to that Sunshine song, and it will make them poop.

481
00:41:07,780 --> 00:41:13,780
And if we have the Sunshine Creep, I love you.

482
00:41:13,780 --> 00:41:18,780
Listen Frog, now is that song worse than Let Them Move?

483
00:41:18,780 --> 00:41:20,780
Is that song worse than Let Them Move?

484
00:41:20,780 --> 00:41:23,780
We will find out, we will find out after the break.

485
00:41:23,780 --> 00:41:25,780
We should make the chat room vote.

486
00:41:53,780 --> 00:42:00,780
Feelin' at my fingertips With an atmosphere

487
00:42:02,780 --> 00:42:04,780
You

488
00:42:05,780 --> 00:42:08,780
Leave me when I'm at first

489
00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:15,780
Feelin' as if I've been a ghost With a cold within

490
00:42:15,780 --> 00:42:22,780
Days go by and still I think of you.

491
00:42:22,780 --> 00:42:30,780
Days when I couldn't live my life without you.

492
00:42:30,780 --> 00:42:34,780
Without you.

493
00:42:34,780 --> 00:42:42,780
Without you.

494
00:42:42,780 --> 00:42:49,780
When your day is bright and sun shines all through the night

495
00:43:12,780 --> 00:43:16,780
That's when, when you know you did

496
00:43:16,780 --> 00:43:21,780
Then you did it by design

497
00:43:21,780 --> 00:43:27,780
Sitting on the beach and sand tickles your feet

498
00:43:27,780 --> 00:43:31,780
That's when, when you know you did

499
00:43:31,780 --> 00:43:37,780
Then you did it by forever sunshine

500
00:43:37,780 --> 00:43:40,780
Like this sport of sunshine

501
00:43:41,780 --> 00:43:44,780
Kind of sport of sunshine

502
00:43:45,780 --> 00:43:48,780
Free of all the sunshine

503
00:43:49,780 --> 00:43:51,780
And you, I'll be kind

504
00:43:52,780 --> 00:43:56,780
If you can meet in the sunshine

505
00:43:56,780 --> 00:44:00,780
Like this sport of sunshine

506
00:44:00,780 --> 00:44:04,780
Free of sport of sunshine

507
00:44:04,780 --> 00:44:12,220
We won't pass

508
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:19,840
The chance

509
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:32,120
Take back

510
00:44:32,120 --> 00:44:38,120
Let's get together, on your heart, me and you

511
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:43,120
And do the things, oh, do the things

512
00:44:43,120 --> 00:44:47,120
That we like to do, oh

513
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:51,120
Do a little dance, make a little love

514
00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:55,120
Get down tonight, get down tonight

515
00:44:55,120 --> 00:45:00,120
Baby babe, I need you

516
00:45:00,120 --> 00:45:03,120
Same place, same time

517
00:45:04,120 --> 00:45:08,120
Where we can all get together

518
00:45:08,120 --> 00:45:12,120
And ease up our mind

519
00:45:12,120 --> 00:45:14,120
Oh, do a little dance

520
00:45:14,120 --> 00:45:16,120
Make a little love

521
00:45:16,120 --> 00:45:18,120
Get down tonight

522
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:21,120
Get down tonight, baby

523
00:45:21,120 --> 00:45:27,120
Get down, get down, get down, get down, get down tonight, baby

524
00:45:27,120 --> 00:45:48,600
Get down, get down, get down, get down, get down tonight baby

525
00:45:48,600 --> 00:46:06,600
Welcome back boys and girls to Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 62, playing Max 2 USA

526
00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:07,960
MP3s all night tonight.

527
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:13,600
In that break you heard Dirty Vegas stays go by, Shell Y with Forever Sunshine, and

528
00:46:13,600 --> 00:46:17,000
Miss Piggy, and Casey and the Sunshine Band with Get Down Tonight.

529
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:22,000
I have to make a comment on the chatroom for your response to Biohazard.

530
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:28,000
Don't diss Casey and the Sunshine Band.

531
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:32,400
That is the best fucking song ever.

532
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:34,200
You know what, though?

533
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:36,720
I do have to agree with half of what he says.

534
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:41,160
I think Let's Groove is funner to dance to, and funner is a word, yes.

535
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:42,160
Gotcha though?

536
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:43,160
Can't stand it.

537
00:46:43,160 --> 00:46:45,360
Can't stand Gotcha.

538
00:46:45,360 --> 00:46:48,600
I cannot stand dancing that song.

539
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:49,640
Okay, just still.

540
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:50,480
Before we went to the break-

541
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:51,720
Casey and the Sunshine Band is better.

542
00:46:51,720 --> 00:46:52,560
Casey and the Sunshine Band rules.

543
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:53,380
Before we went to the break,

544
00:46:53,380 --> 00:46:54,680
we said we were gonna settle a debate.

545
00:46:54,680 --> 00:46:56,520
Which song is worse,

546
00:46:56,520 --> 00:46:58,880
Forever Sunshine or Let Them Move?

547
00:46:58,880 --> 00:46:59,960
The chat room has voted

548
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:01,520
and I will reveal what they have voted,

549
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:02,480
which one is worse,

550
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:05,240
but I just wanna hear what you guys think and why.

551
00:47:05,240 --> 00:47:06,560
Erin, we haven't heard much from you tonight.

552
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:09,800
Which song's worse, Let Them Move or Forever Sunshine?

553
00:47:09,800 --> 00:47:11,600
I guess you guys should know my opinion on this.

554
00:47:11,600 --> 00:47:16,240
i did freestyle

555
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:20,160
well i did i did freestyle to let them move

556
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:23,200
and we all know how that turned out so

557
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:26,560
i guess i could say forever sunshine is kind of weird

558
00:47:26,560 --> 00:47:28,820
but is it worse?

559
00:47:28,820 --> 00:47:30,720
okay so aaron says

560
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:32,800
forever sunshine is a little worse

561
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:35,120
just a little though

562
00:47:35,120 --> 00:47:36,340
uh...

563
00:47:36,340 --> 00:47:37,160
puppy

564
00:47:37,160 --> 00:47:39,320
which one's worse and why?

565
00:47:39,320 --> 00:47:49,320
Front of Sunshine is because I can stand Let Them Move if I turn the volume down a little bit, but no, this song is just ew.

566
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:53,320
Jamie, which is worse and why?

567
00:47:53,320 --> 00:48:00,320
After dealing with Let Them Move for three and a half, nearly four years, uh-uh, Let Them Move is still the worst.

568
00:48:00,320 --> 00:48:08,320
Because, see, that Miss Piggy song, the only thing I don't like about it is her voice. I like the tune, I like the bouncy happy happy.

569
00:48:08,320 --> 00:48:11,440
But let them move, there's nothing redeemable about it.

570
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:15,780
That woman and this piggy need to be shut up, need to be dragged out in the street and

571
00:48:15,780 --> 00:48:20,200
shot repeatedly in various orifices starting with their mouth.

572
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:23,800
Bradley, which song is worse and why?

573
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:25,880
Let Them Move is worse.

574
00:48:25,880 --> 00:48:30,160
This woman in this song can actually sing alright, even if she sings weird.

575
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:38,160
But let them move if she just screeches and makes it much worse.

576
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:40,760
So that's it.

577
00:48:40,760 --> 00:48:42,320
Loki, which song is worse and why?

578
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:45,160
I think they need to do Let Them Move Ska, which would be

579
00:48:45,160 --> 00:48:46,400
pretty cool.

580
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:49,040
Da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da.

581
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:52,840
Let them move, sweet, sweet baby.

582
00:48:52,840 --> 00:48:53,840
They could totally do it.

583
00:48:53,840 --> 00:48:59,800
They get like, I don't know, get some ska band to do it.

584
00:48:59,800 --> 00:49:07,200
I mean, there's plenty of guitar, or was it Mr. Brian and

585
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:11,800
the final ban. Get him to do that. Oh yeah, we should have put Crash in there too, but

586
00:49:11,800 --> 00:49:19,800
that's alright. That wasn't an option. So, what's your answer? I dislike them equally.

587
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:28,560
Honestly, I hate Forever Sunshine because it's happy and I don't like happy. It's happy

588
00:49:28,560 --> 00:49:35,260
like Poppy. Like, look, the sun is smiling, the clouds are smiling, the little furry animals

589
00:49:35,260 --> 00:49:43,540
are smiling everybody is smiling happy happy to scream scream badly yeah I just

590
00:49:43,540 --> 00:49:50,300
all right me personally as much as now I can impersonate Muppets to both of them

591
00:49:50,300 --> 00:49:52,900
because I can do miss piggy with forever sunshine but would let them move I can

592
00:49:52,900 --> 00:50:04,940
also do but let them move is by far worse

593
00:50:04,940 --> 00:50:08,860
I love imitating this piggy more than I do almost, so Forever Sunshine is way worse.

594
00:50:08,860 --> 00:50:10,500
I'm sorry, I mean Let Them Move is way worse.

595
00:50:10,500 --> 00:50:11,740
Forever Sunshine is better.

596
00:50:11,740 --> 00:50:16,380
I actually somewhat enjoy Forever Sunshine in a campy musical sort of way.

597
00:50:16,380 --> 00:50:18,660
All right, so I think it was even.

598
00:50:18,660 --> 00:50:22,940
We had Loki, Bradley, and me said Let Them Move, no, because Jamie also said Let Them

599
00:50:22,940 --> 00:50:23,940
Move is worse.

600
00:50:23,940 --> 00:50:26,580
So it was four, and then you two say Forever Sunshine.

601
00:50:26,580 --> 00:50:28,180
What do you guys think the chat room said?

602
00:50:28,180 --> 00:50:30,080
Let Them Move.

603
00:50:30,080 --> 00:50:36,000
By an overwhelming majority, well mostly overwhelming, the chat room says Let Them Move is the worst

604
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:37,000
song.

605
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:38,000
So, there you go.

606
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:39,000
That's the way you guys voted.

607
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:42,720
I don't think it matters because it's still banned from the station.

608
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:44,000
Let Them Move is banned from the station.

609
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:45,320
I don't know about Forever Sunshine though.

610
00:50:45,320 --> 00:50:47,000
I don't know if I put that in or not today.

611
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,320
I put a bunch of new Max2USA MP3s in today.

612
00:50:49,320 --> 00:50:51,880
I don't know if Forever Sunshine is one of them or not.

613
00:50:51,880 --> 00:50:54,040
Thank you, Violent Hyper Burp Girl.

614
00:50:54,040 --> 00:50:55,040
That was impressive.

615
00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:58,960
Hey, it was a double.

616
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:03,540
Let's get into 2DX News and speaking of bad songs, you know the 9th Style soundtrack came

617
00:51:03,540 --> 00:51:09,080
out like just a week ago pretty much and I have to admit something, and this is hard,

618
00:51:09,080 --> 00:51:15,520
this is painful, I need to sit down for this, and you know the last time I sat down to admit

619
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:20,420
something I was admitting that I like Paul Atari's version of Dive, so you know that

620
00:51:20,420 --> 00:51:23,100
this is bad, okay?

621
00:51:23,100 --> 00:51:27,840
There was a song that I was somewhat surprised to see on the 9th Style soundtrack and I forgot

622
00:51:27,840 --> 00:51:32,680
that this song was in night style, but when I was listening to this song, I realized that

623
00:51:32,680 --> 00:51:40,860
in the context of 2DX, I actually kind of liked this song. And that song, that song

624
00:51:40,860 --> 00:51:54,160
is, don't say it, don't say it, stop, kind of like bag. You fag. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

625
00:51:54,160 --> 00:52:04,160
I like bag. I apologize to my mommy. Jamie likes bag too? It'll only be good when it

626
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:11,840
gets remixed by 2MB. Where the hell has 2MB been? Seriously? He's just like, yeah. That

627
00:52:11,840 --> 00:52:18,760
personality, duh. Okay, where has 2MB been? I mean, seriously, he's just like, after 5th

628
00:52:18,760 --> 00:52:23,300
I quit you know me to get to and be here to take all the shitty sauce and

629
00:52:23,800 --> 00:52:31,100
Naoki the other personality keeps making and remit no wait to MB is not Naoki. I thought it was no

630
00:52:31,360 --> 00:52:33,360
It's you won the hour

631
00:52:34,040 --> 00:52:36,040
You tricked me

632
00:52:37,240 --> 00:52:43,300
How dare I yeah, we need to get him back to like this I absolutely agree with Brack 2000

633
00:52:43,300 --> 00:52:48,440
He says bag is bad for DDR. That's why I hated bag before it is an acid song to dance

634
00:52:48,440 --> 00:52:50,340
Bag should have been in Para Para.

635
00:52:50,340 --> 00:52:51,640
It was not fun at all.

636
00:52:51,640 --> 00:52:56,060
But Bag in 2DX would actually be kind of fun.

637
00:52:56,060 --> 00:52:59,280
I haven't played it in 2DX yet, but I think I'd actually enjoy it.

638
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:03,320
So I found that on the Night Style OST, I actually enjoyed Bag.

639
00:53:03,320 --> 00:53:08,000
Sorry, Loki, it's the truth.

640
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,640
And I believe in telling the truth on this show.

641
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:11,640
Whatever.

642
00:53:11,640 --> 00:53:14,320
Also, on the Night Style soundtrack, there's some great stuff.

643
00:53:14,320 --> 00:53:16,200
A long version of Golden Horn.

644
00:53:16,200 --> 00:53:17,200
Awesome.

645
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:21,160
version of the end of my spiritually and that's not a typo it's not spirituality

646
00:53:21,160 --> 00:53:25,040
it's the end of my spiritually if you listen to the lyrics it's great and yes

647
00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:29,520
I agree with I agree in the chat room somebody I scroll off the screen but

648
00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:34,800
logic board is awesome I love that song so and I and I agree with Jamie when she

649
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:39,440
says more men with nice asses need to dance to bag and wear a kilt and would

650
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:41,440
Would that be a military-style kilt?

651
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:44,440
A full traditional.

652
00:53:44,440 --> 00:53:46,440
Okay.

653
00:53:46,440 --> 00:53:49,440
How does Sweden Savage sound?

654
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:51,440
Pretty nice. Pretty good.

655
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:54,440
That's the other athletics one, right?

656
00:53:54,440 --> 00:53:56,440
That's what I thought. Yeah, it's pretty good.

657
00:53:56,440 --> 00:54:03,440
It's interesting because when you hear things on the night-style OST, it sounds a lot different than those MP3s that were leaked before.

658
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:06,440
Please don't go needs to be in DDR.

659
00:54:06,440 --> 00:54:10,120
Imagine how fun that would be on the little scratchy parts.

660
00:54:10,120 --> 00:54:15,320
Why can't they take songs from 2DX like Please Don't Go and put those into Max 2 USA instead

661
00:54:15,320 --> 00:54:16,320
of...

662
00:54:16,320 --> 00:54:18,860
Oh my God, VJ Army would kick so much ass in DDR.

663
00:54:18,860 --> 00:54:22,600
Why don't they take those instead and put them in instead of repeating fucking Put Your

664
00:54:22,600 --> 00:54:24,480
Faith In Me?

665
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:29,480
And what I don't get is they're like in-house music, so why, I mean...

666
00:54:29,480 --> 00:54:30,480
I know.

667
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:33,660
Pay your artists their little peanut or whatever.

668
00:54:33,660 --> 00:54:37,220
X broke it down on DDR Freak The Reasons Why and he was basically like, you know, you can

669
00:54:37,220 --> 00:54:40,620
have the repeats or you can have nothing or something like that. But I'm like, you know

670
00:54:40,620 --> 00:54:45,740
what, I'm sorry, I respect their decision or whatever but I don't agree with it. I think

671
00:54:45,740 --> 00:54:51,540
they could have taken more 2DX songs. I don't know what they're saving it for because as,

672
00:54:51,540 --> 00:54:54,980
you know, it's going to take another year before we see Max 3 or Xtreme in the U.S.,

673
00:54:54,980 --> 00:54:59,620
whatever it is, if we even see it at all, they may not do one.

674
00:54:59,620 --> 00:55:02,580
Why is it that like you can have... And by then we're going to have 9th and 10th

675
00:55:02,580 --> 00:55:10,340
No, no, no, why is it that you can have a person say, oh, I don't know, this guy goes

676
00:55:10,340 --> 00:55:14,900
by the name Healing Vision, or a guy that goes by the name Utterdude, or this guy,

677
00:55:14,900 --> 00:55:19,920
Matt, I forget his last name, why can they pump out really quality, and this is talking

678
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:26,420
about better than home version, like sim files, of these songs, and we're not talking full

679
00:55:26,420 --> 00:55:31,380
sets, we're talking full difficulties for singles and doubles.

680
00:55:31,380 --> 00:55:37,920
like a few hours and it takes, you know, Konami of America people like half a year to pump

681
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:43,540
out quality steps. I'm going to touch on something. Rumor is, it has not been confirmed that

682
00:55:43,540 --> 00:55:47,840
KOA actually did those steps. Rumor is that KOJ might have done quite a few of them, especially

683
00:55:47,840 --> 00:55:51,960
the things that are going to show up in Extreme later, like Sunshine and stuff. But I'm just

684
00:55:51,960 --> 00:55:55,160
saying, the same people who have done all the steps before are probably still doing

685
00:55:55,160 --> 00:56:00,600
them for DDR Max 2 USA. It has not been confirmed that KOA has been doing them in-house. I have

686
00:56:00,600 --> 00:56:10,600
You have to notice that a lot of the new original songs in Max 2 kind of get stuck with a lot of fucking freeze arrows, and you remember what happened in Max 1 with that.

687
00:56:10,600 --> 00:56:18,600
Hi, here's my suggestion. Dear Konami, when you're going to put out Max 3 or Xtreme or whatever the next thing is that's going to come out in the US, there better be something else!

688
00:56:18,600 --> 00:56:21,600
Please have an edit bank.

689
00:56:21,600 --> 00:56:25,600
Yeah, seriously, go with the databank just like last time.

690
00:56:25,600 --> 00:56:31,840
If this is what you need to link up to the old mixes, fuck this repeating, put your faith

691
00:56:31,840 --> 00:56:36,180
in me stuff just because the damn song was in economics, bring up an edit bank that has

692
00:56:36,180 --> 00:56:41,440
steps to songs like Dark Black Forest, Japan, things that were in earlier mixes, and there

693
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:42,440
you go.

694
00:56:42,440 --> 00:56:44,960
Now people have a reason to get those old mixes because they want to see edit banking

695
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:45,960
with them.

696
00:56:45,960 --> 00:56:50,080
And not only that, here's a few other things you can do.

697
00:56:50,080 --> 00:56:51,560
Put in challenge mode.

698
00:56:51,560 --> 00:57:05,800
You do not need a story mode because then we'd be going back to one of the worst Konami

699
00:57:05,800 --> 00:57:08,000
games ever, Dance Dance Dance.

700
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:12,080
With a little stupid RPG mode in it, ugh that game sucked.

701
00:57:12,080 --> 00:57:13,080
Dance Dance Dance.

702
00:57:13,080 --> 00:57:17,000
Dance Dance Dance, this one started the Bimani thing.

703
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:20,400
Dance Dance Dance started the Bimani thing, it did not begin with Beatmania, the style

704
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:24,400
game with BeatMania, but the whole music game thing started with dance, dance, dance, and

705
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:26,400
the game flows.

706
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:30,440
Yeah, challenge mode for sure, but set up like drill mode, because in that way you can

707
00:57:30,440 --> 00:57:36,420
have drill mode as being both a training lesson mode thing and a challenge mode at the same

708
00:57:36,420 --> 00:57:41,280
time. And drill modes are fun, I mean it takes you a long time to go through and you can

709
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:47,280
incorporate that. That and the unlocks. Don't make a song get unlocked after ten songs.

710
00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:53,840
Seriously, we play a full two sets of songs, five songs each, and we get an unlock.

711
00:57:53,840 --> 00:57:54,840
That's retarded.

712
00:57:54,840 --> 00:57:58,420
But what do you say to the people that disagree with you and say, you know what, fuck the

713
00:57:58,420 --> 00:57:59,920
unlocks, just have it all to begin with.

714
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:01,600
Why do we even waste our time unlocking things?

715
00:58:01,600 --> 00:58:03,240
Just blow your load in the beginning.

716
00:58:03,240 --> 00:58:05,760
Because there's no point in playing the game then if you have no purpose to play the game.

717
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:06,760
You have to have a goal.

718
00:58:06,760 --> 00:58:08,200
Well, what about playing the songs and dancing to them?

719
00:58:08,200 --> 00:58:09,200
That's what you do in DDR.

720
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:10,200
You have to have a goal.

721
00:58:10,200 --> 00:58:11,200
It's going to get boring faster.

722
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:13,200
What would you think now?

723
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:16,560
I think, but we know this is never going to happen because the economy of America is not

724
00:58:16,560 --> 00:58:20,680
going to put out an arcade machine. But let's say KOJ does this. An F-Zero type

725
00:58:20,680 --> 00:58:23,240
unlock system where you have to go back and forth between the arcade and the home

726
00:58:23,240 --> 00:58:29,080
version to unlock things. It would be cool but it'll never work. Because they'll

727
00:58:29,080 --> 00:58:32,200
never make an arcade version.

728
00:58:34,240 --> 00:58:41,600
Anyway, we'd be interested in your suggestions as well for Max 3 USA or

729
00:58:41,600 --> 00:58:45,280
Xtreme, whatever it's called. Oh, it's just put it this way. www.kaliabomani.com

730
00:58:45,280 --> 00:58:47,880
Click on orange lounge and click on chat once I get the freaking

731
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:51,520
Cabinet done in here and you see how I have the sim set up

732
00:58:51,520 --> 00:58:54,540
You know with all the songs and there's gonna be unlocks in there

733
00:58:55,160 --> 00:58:59,000
This is how the damn game should be like my home cabinet

734
00:58:59,120 --> 00:59:03,640
We're gonna have quality songs in there because I don't pay licensing rights to anyone

735
00:59:03,640 --> 00:59:08,640
You should make multiple machines and then sell them.

736
00:59:08,640 --> 00:59:13,640
You should go suck my cock.

737
00:59:13,640 --> 00:59:21,640
Okay, what time is it? We need to record the time so that...

738
00:59:21,640 --> 00:59:28,640
No styling has a great one. He says the unlock should be nude images of Konami's staff.

739
00:59:58,640 --> 01:00:02,960
routine mode where it's another set of steps but it goes with a dancing character on screen

740
01:00:02,960 --> 01:00:05,760
where you do what they do and it kind of goes with that.

741
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:08,240
So like a learn how to freestyle like Mel B.

742
01:00:08,240 --> 01:00:15,680
No, no, see the problem with that is that now you're going to have a bunch of little

743
01:00:15,680 --> 01:00:19,880
uncharted teeny bopper idiots freestyling exactly the same routine and that's really

744
01:00:19,880 --> 01:00:20,880
bad.

745
01:00:20,880 --> 01:00:26,000
As opposed to a bunch of stupid Asians para-para-ing, I mean seriously.

746
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,000
Her is dead, okay?

747
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:33,000
It was cool until they made the videos and put it on the machine.

748
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:40,000
I would be fine with Konami doing a learn how to freestyle like us thing as long as,

749
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:43,000
and I preface this with a disclaimer, views and opinions expressed by me do not express

750
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:51,000
those words on video, as long as it's not 8-Ball.

751
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:52,000
I can't make a comment.

752
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,000
I cannot make a comment.

753
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:57,700
we'll take your silence as your comment

754
01:00:57,700 --> 01:01:00,080
well i still have stuff to say about that

755
01:01:00,080 --> 01:01:01,960
idea for freestyling i mean

756
01:01:01,960 --> 01:01:03,200
then they're all gonna

757
01:01:03,200 --> 01:01:07,680
there's no there's no uniqueness to the freestyling where everyone's just gonna base their routines off what it

758
01:01:07,680 --> 01:01:08,360
looks like

759
01:01:08,360 --> 01:01:09,240
you know what they see on the screen

760
01:01:09,240 --> 01:01:12,540
oh yeah you're right that would be a fucking nightmare because every routine you'd see in the

761
01:01:12,540 --> 01:01:13,240
arcade

762
01:01:13,240 --> 01:01:15,680
would be the same thing as the home version like look at me

763
01:01:15,680 --> 01:01:17,680
and then

764
01:01:17,680 --> 01:01:18,520
just be like

765
01:01:18,520 --> 01:01:22,640
you know everyone knee dropping and hand slapping all over again

766
01:01:22,640 --> 01:01:26,880
OK, so basically it's going to be based off of that routine there.

767
01:01:26,880 --> 01:01:30,880
Gee, no one bases their routines off of music videos or anything.

768
01:01:30,880 --> 01:01:32,400
No one emulates anybody.

769
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:34,840
They're all original.

770
01:01:34,840 --> 01:01:39,600
Then again, do you really want people just imitating the home versions?

771
01:01:39,600 --> 01:01:42,520
It's better than watching people hump the bar, jump over the bar,

772
01:01:42,520 --> 01:01:47,540
run across the screen, hand slap, knee drop, and act like idiots.

773
01:01:47,540 --> 01:01:50,040
No, I don't mind people jumping over the bar for the few times

774
01:01:50,040 --> 01:01:51,520
that they miss and nut themselves.

775
01:01:51,520 --> 01:01:52,640
OK, well, that's fine.

776
01:01:52,640 --> 01:01:57,560
But other than that, though, well, other than freestyle

777
01:01:57,560 --> 01:02:02,040
mode or whatever that would be, my other idea was, now,

778
01:02:02,040 --> 01:02:03,320
StepMe has kind of done this.

779
01:02:03,320 --> 01:02:07,960
They have a mode in it called Minds, which is kind of neat.

780
01:02:07,960 --> 01:02:10,960
There's steps that go up, like arrows and stuff, normal,

781
01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:12,680
whatever, I don't know if it's randomly generated or

782
01:02:12,680 --> 01:02:16,160
whatever, but there's also steps that you can't step on.

783
01:02:16,160 --> 01:02:18,040
If you step on them, you lose health.

784
01:02:18,040 --> 01:02:19,040
This is what I've been saying.

785
01:02:19,040 --> 01:02:22,920
if DDR is going to come back in Japan, it needs to be competitive. I've said this like

786
01:02:22,920 --> 01:02:26,600
five out of the last ten shows, DDR needs to come back competitive, as a competitive

787
01:02:26,600 --> 01:02:31,600
game, as opposed to, let's have fun and hold hands and dance, and play cooperative, da-da-da-da-da-da-da.

788
01:02:31,600 --> 01:02:38,600
Everybody dance! And it needs to be fucking hardcore. Or, you know, like they have second

789
01:02:38,640 --> 01:02:42,120
mixed battle, needs to be something like that in there, they need something like dance magic,

790
01:02:42,120 --> 01:02:46,560
they need just anything that's competitive. I want at the very end of each battle round,

791
01:02:46,560 --> 01:02:52,560
There'd be smoke coming out of the middle of the city, and strobe lights, strobe lights, lots of strobe lights.

792
01:02:52,560 --> 01:02:58,560
Exactly. I want unison. I want all that shit back.

793
01:02:58,560 --> 01:03:01,560
I want second mixed version dance battle.

794
01:03:01,560 --> 01:03:08,560
DDR has gotten fucking tame as it's been going along, and it's time for DDR to get mean.

795
01:03:08,560 --> 01:03:14,560
Do you know how easy tournaments would be? Do you know how easy and common tournaments would be?

796
01:03:14,560 --> 01:03:22,880
they should have tournament mode where it's just already set up in the cabinet but uh yeah um what

797
01:03:22,880 --> 01:03:33,040
else could they have well definitely like um some new sort of unlocks you know but i like see i

798
01:03:33,040 --> 01:03:39,440
liked kind of like max usa's unlocks it was weird yeah where you did that it was where you could

799
01:03:39,440 --> 01:03:44,240
get it by doing the songs you had to do a lot more songs you know 500 songs to get drop the

800
01:03:44,240 --> 01:03:45,240
the bomb.

801
01:03:45,240 --> 01:03:46,240
That was worth it.

802
01:03:46,240 --> 01:03:49,200
But you could do other little stupid things to get them too.

803
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:50,200
You're right.

804
01:03:50,200 --> 01:03:55,360
They need to find a happy medium between Max USA and Max 2 USA.

805
01:03:55,360 --> 01:04:01,040
Because Max USA, I got tired of playing like 500 songs to get the next unlock, but I also

806
01:04:01,040 --> 01:04:05,240
got tired of playing just 10 songs and getting the unlocks like super fast.

807
01:04:05,240 --> 01:04:09,340
So they need to kind of balance it out in the middle there somewhere and that'd be kind

808
01:04:09,340 --> 01:04:10,340
of cool.

809
01:04:10,340 --> 01:04:13,660
It's funny because when Marin in the chat room says, get mean, DDR runs around biting

810
01:04:13,660 --> 01:04:36,660
people

811
01:04:36,660 --> 01:04:43,260
Well, I think it was in Space... No, not Space Jam 5. It was in that Buster, um, move game or whatever that we were playing a while back.

812
01:04:43,260 --> 01:04:44,160
Uh, Dance Summit?

813
01:04:44,160 --> 01:04:50,860
Dance Summit, where if you do good in a song, or do perfect or whatever, that the song changes.

814
01:04:50,860 --> 01:04:53,960
Like, it kind of remixes itself. That would be kind of weird.

815
01:04:53,960 --> 01:04:55,560
But it'd be cool.

816
01:04:55,560 --> 01:04:56,660
Alright, I'm done.

817
01:04:56,660 --> 01:05:00,560
Okay, uh, we're gonna take a quick break, and this break we're gonna hear, uh, Heaven.

818
01:05:00,560 --> 01:05:06,460
This is a big one because, uh, this was the number one requested licensed song, please get it, and Konami did it.

819
01:05:06,460 --> 01:05:10,120
They Got Heaven and we're gonna hear the mix of that that's in DDR Max 2 USA and we're

820
01:05:10,120 --> 01:05:13,760
also gonna hear I Need You, which is one of the songs, is a Konami original that has not

821
01:05:13,760 --> 01:05:16,160
been in DDR any Bimani game before.

822
01:05:16,160 --> 01:05:19,440
And then we'll also hear Keep On Lifting, that song from BeatMania 3 that made it into

823
01:05:19,440 --> 01:05:20,960
Max 2 USA.

824
01:05:20,960 --> 01:05:24,320
When we come back, since we haven't gotten around to it yet, we usually kick off the

825
01:05:24,320 --> 01:05:26,920
show with it, but a lot of people have some stories they want to tell, we're gonna get

826
01:05:26,920 --> 01:05:30,040
into how was your day, how was your week, when we come back.

827
01:05:30,040 --> 01:05:37,040
Maybe you're all that I want When you're lying here in my eyes

828
01:05:37,040 --> 01:05:43,040
I'm finding it hard to believe we're in heaven

829
01:05:43,040 --> 01:06:10,960
Oh, I'm thinking about our younger years There was only you and me

830
01:06:10,960 --> 01:06:13,960
We were young and wild and for free

831
01:06:15,960 --> 01:06:18,960
Now nothing can take you away from me

832
01:06:20,960 --> 01:06:23,960
We've been through the road before

833
01:06:24,960 --> 01:06:26,960
That's over, no

834
01:06:27,960 --> 01:06:30,960
But you've been coming back for more

835
01:06:31,960 --> 01:06:33,960
Baby, you're all that I want

836
01:06:34,960 --> 01:06:37,960
When you're lying here in my house

837
01:06:37,960 --> 01:06:43,960
I'm finding it hard to believe we're in heaven

838
01:06:44,960 --> 01:06:47,960
And love is all that I need

839
01:06:48,960 --> 01:06:51,960
And I found it there in your heart

840
01:06:52,960 --> 01:06:54,960
It is too hard to see

841
01:06:55,960 --> 01:07:01,960
We're in heaven

842
01:07:31,960 --> 01:07:44,960
The promise of love doesn't have been good A little spark of wherever I've been to

843
01:07:44,960 --> 01:07:52,960
The place that I waited for all of my life And I don't know what we're gonna do

844
01:07:52,960 --> 01:07:56,960
I need you, need you

845
01:07:56,960 --> 01:08:00,960
And we know that I'm not alone

846
01:08:00,960 --> 01:08:02,960
You need that

847
01:08:02,960 --> 01:08:05,960
I know I'm the one

848
01:08:05,960 --> 01:08:11,960
I'm going to begin to love you

849
01:08:11,960 --> 01:08:18,960
Oh, believe, believe, believe me

850
01:08:48,960 --> 01:08:50,960
Yeah, and you don't stop

851
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:51,960
Come on!

852
01:08:51,960 --> 01:08:53,960
Can you listen to the touch of jazz?

853
01:08:53,960 --> 01:08:54,960
Singing, drinking to the game

854
01:08:54,960 --> 01:08:56,960
You are loved when I say your name

855
01:08:56,960 --> 01:08:58,960
Bunch of rain, candlelight, wine and dine

856
01:08:58,960 --> 01:09:00,960
Punch line, non-stop dedication

857
01:09:00,960 --> 01:09:02,960
Rock the nation 24-7

858
01:09:02,960 --> 01:09:04,960
It feels like heaven, can you see the king's feet?

859
01:09:04,960 --> 01:09:07,960
Words rise, melody, poetry, you know me

860
01:09:07,960 --> 01:09:11,960
Hard time, long dawn, yeah, let's get it on

861
01:09:11,960 --> 01:09:16,960
What you did for me, I'm so grateful

862
01:09:16,960 --> 01:09:20,960
You lifted what was low, now I'm free

863
01:09:21,960 --> 01:09:25,960
You took the blindness off the icy clearance

864
01:09:25,960 --> 01:09:30,960
Created peace where the confusion had overtaken the flow

865
01:09:30,960 --> 01:09:32,960
You keep fallin' into me

866
01:09:32,960 --> 01:09:34,960
You keep fallin' into me

867
01:09:34,960 --> 01:09:37,960
No, and you keep fallin' into me

868
01:09:37,960 --> 01:09:40,960
Now I gotta say I'm feelin' better

869
01:09:40,960 --> 01:09:42,960
You keep fallin' into me

870
01:09:42,960 --> 01:09:44,960
You keep fallin' into me

871
01:09:44,960 --> 01:09:47,960
We go back to keep on living it like

872
01:09:47,960 --> 01:09:49,960
We're gonna take our feelings back

873
01:09:49,960 --> 01:09:51,960
I read the end of the block when you walked in

874
01:09:51,960 --> 01:09:53,960
Taking time to drop the rideline

875
01:09:53,960 --> 01:09:54,960
Cause you so fine, you're shine

876
01:09:54,960 --> 01:09:56,960
Now you're mine, it was meant to be

877
01:09:56,960 --> 01:09:58,960
You feel it forever baby, we are between

878
01:09:58,960 --> 01:10:00,960
Seeing dreams end up here, don't stop

879
01:10:00,960 --> 01:10:02,960
Like jazz and hip-hop, it can make your body and soul

880
01:10:02,960 --> 01:10:04,960
Our future grow, making dreams come true

881
01:10:04,960 --> 01:10:07,960
Coming strong, baby, do just me and you

882
01:10:07,960 --> 01:10:09,960
Yeah, you know how we do it

883
01:10:09,960 --> 01:10:30,840
Rock Over London, Rock Over Chicago, Orange Lounge Radio, it's a good place to listen

884
01:10:30,840 --> 01:10:34,520
to the music.

885
01:10:34,520 --> 01:10:37,600
Makes me sad, Wesley Willis, dead and gone.

886
01:10:37,600 --> 01:10:38,600
I cry.

887
01:10:38,600 --> 01:10:45,480
Alright, as promised, now is the part of the show where we go around and talk to our guests

888
01:10:45,480 --> 01:10:49,520
and we talk about how was your week and how was your day and I know some people have some

889
01:10:49,520 --> 01:10:53,960
exciting things to talk about and I, for one, I want to talk about, well, we'll get to that

890
01:10:53,960 --> 01:10:54,960
one when we get to me.

891
01:10:54,960 --> 01:10:57,180
Who wants to start tonight?

892
01:10:57,180 --> 01:10:58,180
You always do, Jamie.

893
01:10:58,180 --> 01:10:59,180
Go for it.

894
01:10:59,180 --> 01:11:03,320
I didn't know you always did, but fine, do it.

895
01:11:03,320 --> 01:11:05,360
Jamie is shoving a peanut in her mouth.

896
01:11:05,360 --> 01:11:07,100
What if other people want to go first today?

897
01:11:07,100 --> 01:11:12,940
But if other people want to go first today, screw them.

898
01:11:12,940 --> 01:11:16,860
My week has been okay.

899
01:11:16,860 --> 01:11:21,380
I've been sleep deprived all week, I haven't gotten more than four hours of sleep a night.

900
01:11:21,380 --> 01:11:24,180
So I crashed really bad on Friday night.

901
01:11:24,180 --> 01:11:28,620
I stayed up as late as I could, I used to play fantasy star, uh-uh.

902
01:11:28,620 --> 01:11:33,460
I barely had enough of an attention span for Ragnarok.

903
01:11:33,460 --> 01:11:39,620
I passed out like at 2 a.m., got up at 1130-ish, something like that.

904
01:11:39,620 --> 01:11:46,500
I went out and hung out with Iguana Girl all weekend, all Saturday, and we bought Iguana

905
01:11:46,500 --> 01:11:55,980
food for Moo, and watched Life of Brian and Jay and Silent Bob back to back while cutting

906
01:11:55,980 --> 01:11:56,980
it green.

907
01:11:56,980 --> 01:11:58,220
So my fingers turned green.

908
01:11:58,220 --> 01:11:59,820
It was scary.

909
01:11:59,820 --> 01:12:01,300
I played DDR Thursday.

910
01:12:01,300 --> 01:12:05,840
Oh my gosh, okay, you have to realize the past like three weeks I go here Jamie

911
01:12:05,840 --> 01:12:07,840
Do you have anything Bamani related? You want to tell us?

912
01:12:09,840 --> 01:12:14,020
You made it in your life journal entry and I know you keep your life journal

913
01:12:14,680 --> 01:12:19,500
friends only but maybe this is one you wouldn't mind sharing kind of about what you were saying about 40 minutes of DDS

914
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:25,540
306 calories burned. Hey, so and that's just like, you know on the medium mode on workout

915
01:12:26,120 --> 01:12:27,820
I'm workout mode

916
01:12:27,820 --> 01:12:29,820
on the old max

917
01:12:29,820 --> 01:12:34,780
Yeah, because that was before I got my MAX II.

918
01:12:34,780 --> 01:12:35,780
And you know what?

919
01:12:35,780 --> 01:12:37,200
It was pretty fun.

920
01:12:37,200 --> 01:12:39,140
I was really tired and everything.

921
01:12:39,140 --> 01:12:41,140
Yeah, this was Thursday.

922
01:12:41,140 --> 01:12:43,660
No, I'll take it back.

923
01:12:43,660 --> 01:12:44,660
It wasn't Thursday.

924
01:12:44,660 --> 01:12:45,660
It was Wednesday.

925
01:12:45,660 --> 01:12:46,660
Something like that.

926
01:12:46,660 --> 01:12:50,820
But anyway, I was still really tired.

927
01:12:50,820 --> 01:12:53,660
I've been so tired all week that I really haven't been able to put much more effort

928
01:12:53,660 --> 01:12:54,660
into it.

929
01:12:54,660 --> 01:12:58,780
But that's how, when I first started playing DDR,

930
01:12:58,780 --> 01:13:00,500
I played for an hour every night.

931
01:13:00,500 --> 01:13:01,620
I mean, more than an hour.

932
01:13:01,620 --> 01:13:03,100
I would do like two hours of nothing

933
01:13:03,100 --> 01:13:05,500
but knockout on second mix.

934
01:13:05,500 --> 01:13:08,300
And I'm thinking that that's what I'm going to do again.

935
01:13:08,300 --> 01:13:09,700
Better living through DDR.

936
01:13:09,700 --> 01:13:12,540
Seriously, I'm going to lose weight again.

937
01:13:12,540 --> 01:13:14,380
If I play more DDR, I'll lose weight again.

938
01:13:14,380 --> 01:13:18,540
So I'm going to get back into playing and mixing

939
01:13:18,540 --> 01:13:20,020
that with going to the gym.

940
01:13:20,020 --> 01:13:26,660
And Saturday, I got milk tea and boiled peanuts.

941
01:13:26,660 --> 01:13:28,940
And I don't know how many people know anything

942
01:13:28,940 --> 01:13:30,740
about living in the South.

943
01:13:30,740 --> 01:13:33,220
But I haven't, for years, I hadn't

944
01:13:33,220 --> 01:13:39,060
been able to find boiled peanuts until I moved out here,

945
01:13:39,060 --> 01:13:42,020
until I started shopping at the Asian food stores.

946
01:13:42,020 --> 01:13:43,980
So I was like, boiled peanuts.

947
01:13:43,980 --> 01:13:45,660
And they were fresh boiled peanuts.

948
01:13:45,660 --> 01:13:48,060
Everything was really good.

949
01:13:48,060 --> 01:13:56,300
And anyway, I've got some goodies.

950
01:13:56,300 --> 01:14:01,780
I have lots of key at home, picked up some treats for people.

951
01:14:01,780 --> 01:14:08,060
But boiled peanuts, that was like the highlight of my weekend was boiled peanuts.

952
01:14:08,060 --> 01:14:09,100
I never get them.

953
01:14:09,100 --> 01:14:12,620
The one thing that I wish I could find is boiled peanuts in a can.

954
01:14:12,620 --> 01:14:16,500
I've not been able to find those anywhere outside the South.

955
01:14:16,500 --> 01:14:19,260
So that's been my, yeah, and I've been busy with other stuff.

956
01:14:19,260 --> 01:14:23,700
The really crappy drama thing seems to have subsided, which I'm pretty glad for.

957
01:14:24,760 --> 01:14:25,260
And.

958
01:14:25,260 --> 01:14:26,020
There was drama?

959
01:14:27,200 --> 01:14:33,280
There was drama involving a site, but it's pretty much resolved.

960
01:14:33,620 --> 01:14:38,540
I've just been feeling really crappy all week, you know, in general, but it hasn't been a bad week.

961
01:14:39,640 --> 01:14:43,660
So, and they can't hear any of your commentary because you're busy sucking nuts.

962
01:14:43,660 --> 01:14:49,020
the look on your face is great

963
01:14:49,020 --> 01:14:53,300
my nuts are good, they're safe for consumption

964
01:14:53,300 --> 01:14:56,420
anyway

965
01:14:56,420 --> 01:14:59,860
you're done? GEEZ! I'm just saying

966
01:14:59,860 --> 01:15:03,580
are you done? yeah! are you dead?

967
01:15:03,580 --> 01:15:06,420
Erin's got her hand out so

968
01:15:06,420 --> 01:15:09,740

01:15:09,740 --> 01:15:13,640

How was your week? How was your day?

971

Alright, well, um, for those of you who know X to Nine Cent, aka Claudia, has officially got me addicted to Initial D!

972
01:15:21,640 --> 01:15:25,640
Boo! Damn her! Just kidding.

973
01:15:25,640 --> 01:15:29,640
Yeah, I spent a total, at least ten dollars on the game.

974
01:15:29,640 --> 01:15:35,640
Cause it's only, it's only like forty, it's only like forty cents at the MU to play.

975
01:15:35,640 --> 01:15:40,640
And, it's five tokens to a dollar, so, two tokens per game.

976
01:15:40,640 --> 01:15:49,280
so yeah five games for two dollars good shit also i started school this week and workload 57

977
01:15:49,280 --> 01:15:53,280
english 57 which is a stupid little remedial english class feels just like high school

978
01:15:54,320 --> 01:16:00,880
unfortunately so i'm stuck there for a quarter and yeah i have to interject real fast because

979

01:16:11,600 --> 01:16:18,200
And Holly says, can I have your salty nuts? Uh, sure. Anyway, sorry to interrupt, do you

982
01:16:18,200 --> 01:16:22,040
want to finish your story? Well, yeah, I actually didn't get lost on campus for my first day

983
01:16:22,040 --> 01:16:28,000
of school, woohoo! And I've also become quite popular in the dorms after playing piano so

984
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:38,560
many times. Oh, you're already popular in the dorms, huh? Not that way! But yeah, other

985
01:16:38,560 --> 01:16:42,880
than that, we kind of settled in. Our apartments cooled down considerably. Davis has only been

986
01:16:42,880 --> 01:16:51,680
hitting upwards of, at best, 90 this past week. Yeah, it's been pretty good. And let's

987
01:16:51,680 --> 01:16:58,600
see. Anything special today? No, not really other than it's good to be on Orange Lounge

988
01:16:58,600 --> 01:17:02,520
when there's no internet problems. Yeah, it's nice to be here on a week where the station

989
01:17:02,520 --> 01:17:07,140
works, huh? For those of you that missed last week, you're better off, okay? Just trust

990
01:17:07,140 --> 01:17:10,680
us. We wrote it off. You know what though? You know what's interesting about last week's

991
01:17:10,680 --> 01:17:15,520
show, and I didn't realize this until I was going back and clipping it down for the archives.

992
01:17:15,520 --> 01:17:19,720
We did not take a single break last week at all. Yeah, you didn't notice that? We never

993
01:17:19,720 --> 01:17:23,440
I didn't notice that we did two hours straight so if you think about it, even though a lot

994
01:17:23,440 --> 01:17:26,800
of people were kind of like oh you guys only did two hours you know with all the problems

995
01:17:26,800 --> 01:17:32,280
even though we dropped you guys 37 times thanks to Comcast if you think about it with two

996
01:17:32,280 --> 01:17:36,080
hours straight of content you know throw breaks there really wasn't you didn't lose that much

997
01:17:36,080 --> 01:17:43,480
a show so shut up that's my point shut up yeah all right um let's see other than that

998
01:17:43,480 --> 01:17:46,660
I've actually had my room to myself I'm supposed to be sharing my room with my friend but she

999
01:17:46,660 --> 01:17:47,660
She hasn't been home.

1000
01:17:47,660 --> 01:17:48,660
Lucky you.

1001
01:17:48,660 --> 01:17:49,660
Oh!

1002
01:17:49,660 --> 01:17:50,660
Does she have a boyfriend?

1003
01:17:50,660 --> 01:17:51,660
Yeah, she's been spending...

1004
01:17:51,660 --> 01:17:52,660
See, there you go.

1005
01:17:52,660 --> 01:17:54,780
That's what always happens in college is that, you know, my roommate was the same way indoors

1006
01:17:54,780 --> 01:17:56,460
that he was rushing a fraternity.

1007
01:17:56,460 --> 01:18:00,580
So he was sleeping with all his boyfriends.

1008
01:18:00,580 --> 01:18:04,900
And we all probably know what he was doing with all of them.

1009
01:18:04,900 --> 01:18:07,820
Actually no, he also had a girlfriend that lived upstairs and he was staying there sometimes

1010
01:18:07,820 --> 01:18:12,260
because the one time she came to stay there, I had a fit, okay?

1011
01:18:12,260 --> 01:18:17,700
I was just like, I don't feel comfortable with her being here in the morning when I'm

1012
01:18:17,700 --> 01:18:18,700
waking up.

1013
01:18:18,700 --> 01:18:20,820
I'm just like, that's weird.

1014
01:18:20,820 --> 01:18:21,820
Yeah.

1015
01:18:21,820 --> 01:18:25,900
But yeah, okay, so anyone else want to talk about their week?

1016
01:18:25,900 --> 01:18:26,900
Okay, so you're done.

1017
01:18:26,900 --> 01:18:31,460
Bradley, you have anything you want to share about your week and your day?

1018
01:18:31,460 --> 01:18:32,460
How was your week?

1019
01:18:32,460 --> 01:18:33,460
How was your day, Bradley?

1020
01:18:33,460 --> 01:18:34,460
Hold on.

1021
01:18:34,460 --> 01:18:38,740
It's caught on the other one.

1022
01:18:38,740 --> 01:18:39,740
Take it away.

1023
01:18:39,740 --> 01:18:40,740
Okay.

1024
01:18:40,740 --> 01:18:48,580
I didn't do all that much this week.

1025
01:18:48,580 --> 01:18:56,060
Every so often, most of it was being lazy for most of the day, punctuated by fits every

1026
01:18:56,060 --> 01:19:02,780
so often of looking for a job online, and applying to one or two or three places, and

1027
01:19:02,780 --> 01:19:06,660
hopefully someone will call me, because if they don't, I might have to leave the state

1028
01:19:06,660 --> 01:19:07,660
probably.

1029
01:19:07,660 --> 01:19:08,660
Oh, shit.

1030
01:19:08,660 --> 01:19:09,660
It sucks, yeah.

1031
01:19:09,660 --> 01:19:10,660
That's not good.

1032
01:19:10,660 --> 01:19:17,660
Hello, if you're out there and you want to hire somebody, RKDN42 Bradley, hire him.

1033
01:19:17,660 --> 01:19:24,660
Well, most of it's because I'm stupid and it took too long to do stuff.

1034
01:19:24,660 --> 01:19:27,660
Anyway, let's see, anything else I did this week?

1035
01:19:27,660 --> 01:19:30,660
What else might I have done?

1036
01:19:30,660 --> 01:19:35,660
Actually, I don't think I went anywhere any time this week, except for Wednesday I came

1037
01:19:35,660 --> 01:19:38,660
over here and played some DDR Max 2.

1038
01:19:38,660 --> 01:19:44,020
Since I only have the Japanese version, I don't have a U.S. PS2, so I got to experience

1039
01:19:44,020 --> 01:19:45,020
that.

1040
01:19:45,020 --> 01:19:46,020
Oh, good.

1041
01:19:46,020 --> 01:19:47,020
Good deal.

1042
01:19:47,020 --> 01:19:48,020
He went to...

1043
01:19:48,020 --> 01:19:49,020
Yes.

1044
01:19:49,020 --> 01:19:50,020
He went away.

1045
01:19:50,020 --> 01:19:54,660
Went far, far away to get power.

1046
01:19:54,660 --> 01:19:55,660
Staying in power.

1047
01:19:55,660 --> 01:19:56,660
Here he is.

1048
01:19:56,660 --> 01:19:57,660
Puppy, there he is.

1049
01:19:57,660 --> 01:19:58,660
I should have made him give me something too.

1050
01:19:58,660 --> 01:19:59,660
Oh well.

1051
01:19:59,660 --> 01:20:00,660
I should have sent him a shopping list.

1052
01:20:00,660 --> 01:20:01,660
Yeah, go back.

1053
01:20:01,660 --> 01:20:02,660
She didn't go anywhere yesterday.

1054
01:20:02,660 --> 01:20:03,660
I thought I went somewhere yesterday.

1055
01:20:03,660 --> 01:20:04,660
Oh crap.

1056
01:20:04,660 --> 01:20:09,340
I thought I went somewhere yesterday, oh crap, now I can't remember where I went.

1057
01:20:09,340 --> 01:20:14,180
I think I might have went to Walmart, or actually I went to Walmart today.

1058
01:20:14,180 --> 01:20:17,620
Damn I also forget why I didn't do one thing and I forget what I did.

1059
01:20:17,620 --> 01:20:29,500
Oh actually I went to the post office to mail stuff I sold off and then today I watched

1060
01:20:29,500 --> 01:20:32,160
the debate from wednesday after

1061
01:20:32,160 --> 01:20:34,280
the governor's debate

1062
01:20:34,280 --> 01:20:35,440
and being silly

1063
01:20:35,440 --> 01:20:36,880
yeah it was

1064
01:20:36,880 --> 01:20:39,040
sorta

1065
01:20:39,040 --> 01:20:42,880
okay not all that great of a debate

1066
01:20:42,880 --> 01:20:45,640
arnold didn't really impress me all that much

1067
01:20:45,640 --> 01:20:49,680
he was more impressed by when he was on

1068
01:20:49,680 --> 01:20:51,480
what's-his-face larry king

1069
01:20:51,480 --> 01:20:54,480
he was a bit more

1070
01:20:54,480 --> 01:20:56,400
no no he was on larry king like

1071
01:20:56,400 --> 01:21:07,360
two weeks ago. And, that's pretty much my week. So exciting! Alright, thanks for sharing.

1072
01:21:07,360 --> 01:21:13,760
You're just jumping up and down now. Alright, we'll put Puppey on the spot since he dared

1073
01:21:13,760 --> 01:21:26,880
to leave the show property how was your week how's your day traitor okay this

1074
01:21:26,880 --> 01:21:37,040
week I started classes yay and I spent most of my time playing this guy until I

1075
01:21:37,040 --> 01:21:43,240
got max 2 and then I spent all the time playing that and the occasional initial

1076
01:21:43,240 --> 01:22:00,240
D-Binge too. Yesterday, I went to Roseville to play F-Zero for nine straight hours. Call

1077
01:22:00,240 --> 01:22:03,480
me an addict, I don't care. It's true.

1078
01:22:03,480 --> 01:22:07,240
Was the price down to four tokens by then?

1079
01:22:07,240 --> 01:22:08,240
Yes, it was.

1080
01:22:08,240 --> 01:22:11,340
For the first two days, it was six tokens a game.

1081
01:22:11,340 --> 01:22:15,340
And they also didn't have the real cars until Saturday.

1082
01:22:19,340 --> 01:22:21,340
As I finished chewing my candy.

1083
01:22:21,340 --> 01:22:23,340
Yeah, hello, you're on the radio, don't eat.

1084
01:22:23,340 --> 01:22:24,340
Whatever.

1085
01:22:25,340 --> 01:22:27,340
So I spent nine hours.

1086
01:22:28,340 --> 01:22:30,340
I played 37 games.

1087
01:22:30,340 --> 01:22:31,340
In a row?

1088
01:22:31,340 --> 01:22:32,340
No.

1089
01:22:33,340 --> 01:22:35,340
I knew that was coming.

1090
01:22:35,340 --> 01:22:36,340
I had to!

1091
01:22:36,340 --> 01:22:39,340
It was like the cursed number of the show.

1092
01:22:39,340 --> 01:22:53,340
And then I started from scratch on a brand new card and worked my way all the way up to the highest rank possible as a Master Class license.

1093
01:22:53,340 --> 01:23:01,340
I got all the way up to that and I took all the records on five of the six tracks on Time Attack.

1094
01:23:01,340 --> 01:23:14,340
And then today I woke up at 1.30 and then sat in the apartment and then came here.

1095
01:23:14,340 --> 01:23:16,340
Alright, yeah.

1096
01:23:16,340 --> 01:23:18,340
Anything else you want to share?

1097
01:23:18,340 --> 01:23:25,340
Random non-stops have been keeping me up late at night because it's just ridiculously fun.

1098
01:23:25,340 --> 01:23:32,340
Even though it screws you over with things like Subaru Dark Reverse Stealth.

1099
01:23:32,340 --> 01:23:38,340
The one time we played it here on Wednesday when we were broadcasting, they got a really

1100
01:23:38,340 --> 01:23:39,340
easy one.

1101
01:23:39,340 --> 01:23:41,940
It was like all standard songs, it was stupid.

1102
01:23:41,940 --> 01:23:43,700
You haven't played it enough then?

1103
01:23:43,700 --> 01:23:44,700
Apparently.

1104
01:23:44,700 --> 01:23:45,700
Okay.

1105
01:23:45,700 --> 01:23:48,300
Let's do some really fucked up things.

1106
01:23:48,300 --> 01:23:51,340
Loki, have a second to tell us about your week and your day?

1107
01:23:51,340 --> 01:23:52,340
Yeah.

1108
01:23:52,340 --> 01:23:53,340
Alright.

1109
01:23:53,340 --> 01:23:54,340
How was your day?

1110
01:23:54,340 --> 01:24:00,460
My week was alright, didn't do a whole lot.

1111
01:24:00,460 --> 01:24:11,040
Stopped doing live wire because Thursday nights only 4 people were listening to me and I work

1112
01:24:11,040 --> 01:24:15,940
on it for 3 hours and that's not a very good mix so I'm taking time off until I feel like

1113
01:24:15,940 --> 01:24:21,620
doing it again and then it'll be Wednesdays and then today I've been soldering and for

1114
01:24:21,620 --> 01:24:26,460
For some fucking reason in the last five minutes, the solder gun does not want to melt the solder,

1115
01:24:26,460 --> 01:24:27,460
period.

1116
01:24:27,460 --> 01:24:35,740
So I'm trying to clean the tip, because I think that's what's wrong.

1117
01:24:35,740 --> 01:24:36,740
And let's see.

1118
01:24:36,740 --> 01:24:37,740
Well, you know what?

1119
01:24:37,740 --> 01:24:41,060
You should ditch your class to listen to my show, 23 Maggots.

1120
01:24:41,060 --> 01:24:44,820
Don't fucking mention shit if it's out of your control, dumbass.

1121
01:24:44,820 --> 01:24:51,820
Well, if I wasn't dead with the computer and the modem, I wouldn't do it, too.

1122
01:24:51,820 --> 01:24:57,820
Yeah, the whole world would listen to me, too, also.

1123
01:24:57,820 --> 01:24:58,820
Anyways.

1124
01:24:58,820 --> 01:25:03,820
There's one eel, and there's two of them.

1125
01:25:03,820 --> 01:25:04,820
What else?

1126
01:25:04,820 --> 01:25:09,820
Also, today I went shopping and got some more controllers so I can work on my pads.

1127
01:25:09,820 --> 01:25:12,820
I got all the wiring done on my pads, so that's kinda cool.

1128
01:25:12,820 --> 01:25:18,820
And this should be done hopefully next week, but I don't know because it's been going really slowly.

1129
01:25:18,820 --> 01:25:21,820
And then that's it. I'm done.

1130
01:25:21,820 --> 01:25:25,820
Oh, went and played F-Zero. That was kind of neat.

1131
01:25:25,820 --> 01:25:29,820
That was about it.

1132
01:25:29,820 --> 01:25:34,820
I'm done. I'm done.

1133
01:25:34,820 --> 01:25:38,820
All right. I need to talk about my week of my day. I can't eat right now.

1134
01:25:38,820 --> 01:25:39,820
All right, my week of my day.

1135
01:25:39,820 --> 01:25:49,820
My week is pretty good. I saw a lot of movies this week. I've been hanging out with Joey, who's been on the show the past couple of weeks, and he likes to watch a lot of movies at home, so I've been catching up on all these movies I didn't see.

1136
01:25:49,820 --> 01:26:00,820
I finally saw Resident Evil for the first time, which was stupid. Also, though, on Thursday was when Roseville Golf Land finally got Max 2, and that made me as happy as a little girl.

1137
01:26:00,820 --> 01:26:07,260
What the hell am I talking about?

1138
01:26:07,260 --> 01:26:09,820
I'm torn between food and making sense.

1139
01:26:09,820 --> 01:26:10,820
I mean F-Zero.

1140
01:26:10,820 --> 01:26:14,760
GolfLink got F-Zero and I was so excited because I've been wanting to play F-Zero in the arcade

1141
01:26:14,760 --> 01:26:15,760
for so long.

1142
01:26:15,760 --> 01:26:17,940
And F-Zero in the arcade is awesome.

1143
01:26:17,940 --> 01:26:19,820
It is so awesome.

1144
01:26:19,820 --> 01:26:21,680
And I love how it links with the home version.

1145
01:26:21,680 --> 01:26:29,620
You can practically unlock all of AX for your GX if you play enough in the arcade.

1146
01:26:29,620 --> 01:26:33,500
So after playing F-Zero a lot, and I like to play it where you ride, too, where you

1147
01:26:33,500 --> 01:26:36,020
go move with the thing when you put the seat belt on.

1148
01:26:36,020 --> 01:26:40,060
I only did that a couple times, but they have a motion machine at Roswell Golf Line, so

1149
01:26:40,060 --> 01:26:41,060
it makes it more fun.

1150
01:26:41,060 --> 01:26:45,340
I don't like doing the motion on the harder courses, because it's ridiculous.

1151
01:26:45,340 --> 01:26:49,600
Since the steering wheel itself doesn't move with the rest of the seat, it's ridiculously

1152
01:26:49,600 --> 01:26:51,240
hard to steer.

1153
01:26:51,240 --> 01:26:54,220
A little bit, yeah, that's true.

1154
01:26:54,220 --> 01:26:58,500
I don't do it anymore, but it was fun the first couple times to go, wee, wee.

1155
01:26:58,500 --> 01:27:00,500
Did you play all the courses?

1156
01:27:00,500 --> 01:27:04,500
I haven't played them all. No, I've been trying to just play them and race and try to unlock them.

1157
01:27:04,500 --> 01:27:09,500
I love Aeropolis. I love the one on the home version. That's one of my favorite tracks, so I had to play that a lot.

1158
01:27:09,500 --> 01:27:11,500
And then I've been playing the outer space one a little bit earlier.

1159
01:27:11,500 --> 01:27:13,500
Green Plant is fucking crazy.

1160
01:27:15,500 --> 01:27:18,500
The last course is fucking crazy. It's like four minutes long.

1161
01:27:18,500 --> 01:27:20,500
Yeah. It's only one lap, isn't it?

1162
01:27:20,500 --> 01:27:21,500
It's three laps.

1163
01:27:21,500 --> 01:27:22,500
Really? Dang.

1164
01:27:22,500 --> 01:27:24,500
Yeah. It's like...

1165
01:27:24,500 --> 01:27:27,500
The average race on that course is like four and a half minutes.

1166
01:27:27,500 --> 01:27:35,900
minutes. That's cool. So F-Zero was cool. And you know what? It got me to go to Roso

1167
01:27:35,900 --> 01:27:41,060
Golf Land and when I was able to play there, it was a Thursday night, about 8 o'clock,

1168
01:27:41,060 --> 01:27:46,940
so there weren't a lot of kids there and it was nice and quiet and DDR was so loud because

1169
01:27:46,940 --> 01:27:50,780
not a lot of games were going and I got to play Conga Feelin' on 4th Plus and I got to

1170
01:27:50,780 --> 01:27:54,580
blast the shit out of it and I had so much fun playing DDR and I haven't had that in

1171
01:27:54,580 --> 01:27:58,880
a long time so I'm actually on good terms with the Roswell Golf Line again and I'm going

1172
01:27:58,880 --> 01:27:59,880
to be going there more often.

1173
01:27:59,880 --> 01:28:00,980
It's a revival!

1174
01:28:00,980 --> 01:28:01,980
It's weird.

1175
01:28:01,980 --> 01:28:06,560
I actually, I kind of want to bring back like how we used to go there once a week.

1176
01:28:06,560 --> 01:28:10,060
I kind of want to bring that back, I just don't know when.

1177
01:28:10,060 --> 01:28:11,320
I don't know.

1178
01:28:11,320 --> 01:28:12,320
Maybe Thursday nights.

1179
01:28:12,320 --> 01:28:15,300
And then you can warn the boss of 2DX.

1180
01:28:15,300 --> 01:28:20,100
Well actually Scandia fixed their 2DX machine, Scandia fixed some of their stuff so I kind

1181
01:28:20,100 --> 01:28:21,100
of have to share time.

1182
01:28:21,100 --> 01:28:24,180
Well as of yesterday, 2DX still sucked.

1183
01:28:24,180 --> 01:28:33,220
I couldn't play right side very well. I couldn't pass. I failed deadline light seven because I couldn't pass because the frickin keys stuck so much

1184
01:28:35,380 --> 01:28:41,240
It was ridiculous, and then I end up playing left side auto scratch so I could just pass songs

1185
01:28:44,940 --> 01:28:47,260
Dead air um okay

1186
01:28:47,260 --> 01:28:49,760
OK.

1187
01:28:49,760 --> 01:28:52,180
That's pretty much all I have to say about my day and my week.

1188
01:28:52,180 --> 01:28:57,060
So I think what we're going to do, we're going to take a break.

1189
01:28:57,060 --> 01:29:01,380
And when we come back, we'll talk a little bit more,

1190
01:29:01,380 --> 01:29:03,520
and then we'll get into the cage match.

1191
01:29:03,520 --> 01:29:05,300

In this break, we're going to hear some more

1198
01:29:21,780 --> 01:29:27,540
Max 2 USA MB3s, such as, where did we leave off last time?

1199
01:29:27,540 --> 01:29:30,420
We're going to hear Love at First Sight, the Kylie song.

1200
01:29:30,420 --> 01:29:32,060
More Deep, version 2.1.

1201
01:29:32,060 --> 01:29:33,180
Who's tapping on the mic?

1202
01:29:33,180 --> 01:29:34,300
Stop.

1203
01:29:34,300 --> 01:29:36,280
More Deep, version 2.1.

1204
01:29:36,280 --> 01:29:37,860
And Take Me Away Into the Night.

1205
01:29:37,860 --> 01:29:39,560
We're going to hear all those this break.

1206
01:29:39,560 --> 01:29:40,300
We will be back.

1207
01:30:10,300 --> 01:30:16,300
One of the things that I didn't know what to do

1208
01:30:16,300 --> 01:30:19,300
Then there was you

1209
01:30:19,300 --> 01:30:23,300
But the feeling went so wrong tonight

1210
01:30:23,300 --> 01:30:27,300
And the stars came up still the same

1211
01:30:27,300 --> 01:30:30,300
The music they were playing really blew my mind

1212
01:30:30,300 --> 01:30:36,780
My new love is just like a baby

1213
01:30:36,780 --> 01:30:41,980
Well, I heard for a long, long, long time

1214
01:30:41,980 --> 01:30:49,500
I knew we were meant to be a song

1215
01:30:49,500 --> 01:30:57,500
I heard for a long, long, long, long time

1216
01:30:57,500 --> 01:31:07,500
I will be whatever you desire

1217
01:31:27,500 --> 01:31:34,500
Don't stop sleeping with me

1218
01:31:34,500 --> 01:31:42,500
We don't fear, we don't love you

1219
01:32:12,500 --> 01:32:19,500
You found it deep, deep down, instantly

1220
01:32:19,500 --> 01:32:24,500
I do wish eternity

1221
01:32:24,500 --> 01:32:27,500
Just for

1222
01:32:31,500 --> 01:32:38,500
Just for sweet, sweet, sweet

1223
01:32:38,500 --> 01:32:41,700
Keep on breathing

1224
01:32:52,700 --> 01:32:54,500
Shining light

1225
01:32:56,100 --> 01:32:59,500
Another day turns into night

1226
01:32:59,500 --> 01:33:01,500
Eternal fire

1227
01:33:03,100 --> 01:33:05,700
Waiting all my life

1228
01:33:05,700 --> 01:33:12,700
Take me away, million miles away from here

1229
01:33:12,700 --> 01:33:19,700
Take me away, find a place for you and me

1230
01:33:19,700 --> 01:33:26,700
You're taking me higher, high as I could be

1231
01:33:26,700 --> 01:33:32,700
Take me away, forever you and me

1232
01:33:32,700 --> 01:33:34,700
Take me away

1233
01:33:44,200 --> 01:33:46,200
Take me away

1234
01:33:47,700 --> 01:33:50,700
Million miles away from me

1235
01:33:51,200 --> 01:33:53,200
Take me away

1236
01:33:54,700 --> 01:33:57,700
Find a place for you and me

1237
01:33:58,200 --> 01:34:00,200
Take me higher

1238
01:34:00,200 --> 01:34:13,200
High as I could see, take me away Forever you and me, take me away

1239
01:34:30,200 --> 01:34:34,440
Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 62 in progress.

1240
01:34:34,440 --> 01:34:39,560
I'm joined tonight by my lovely co-hosts, DarkSakra and TechMasaLoki.

1241
01:34:39,560 --> 01:34:43,760
Also in the house, puppy and violent hyper girl, BlackLab.

1242
01:34:43,760 --> 01:34:44,760
We call him Puppy.

1243
01:34:44,760 --> 01:34:47,200
He's not BlackLab here, he's Puppy.

1244
01:34:47,200 --> 01:34:50,400
It's funny when everybody starts calling me that and then I start getting called that

1245
01:34:50,400 --> 01:34:51,400
in person.

1246
01:34:51,400 --> 01:34:53,440
Oh my God, he has a flashing foot on DNR Freak.

1247
01:34:53,440 --> 01:34:55,640
Yes, I get the seizure foot.

1248
01:34:55,640 --> 01:34:58,200
Wait a minute, how much longer?

1249
01:34:58,200 --> 01:34:59,200
Arcadian 42.

1250
01:34:59,200 --> 01:35:28,200
How do you try to love somebody that doesn't just happen like diarrhea?

1251
01:35:28,200 --> 01:35:32,200
Maybe like, I don't know, I don't even want to try and guess.

1252
01:35:32,200 --> 01:35:35,200
I don't get that trying thing, you're just supposed to do it.

1253
01:35:35,200 --> 01:35:38,200
You know what, why don't you write Konami a letter?

1254
01:35:38,200 --> 01:35:44,200
Yeah, we should all write one big letter to Konami about what we think they should do with DDR.

1255
01:35:44,200 --> 01:35:48,200
Interesting question came up in the chat room, kind of going back to Max2USA.

1256
01:35:48,200 --> 01:35:50,200
Favorite license song?

1257
01:35:50,200 --> 01:35:52,200
Probably

1258
01:35:53,920 --> 01:35:56,980
License favorite license, uh, I'd have to say

1259
01:35:57,940 --> 01:35:59,040
No

1260
01:35:59,040 --> 01:36:00,600
max to

1261
01:36:00,600 --> 01:36:02,560
max to yeah, um

1262
01:36:02,560 --> 01:36:04,560
actually I have to say that um a

1263
01:36:04,960 --> 01:36:09,760
Little bit of ecstasy is I what I thought it would be very fun for the studs

1264
01:36:09,760 --> 01:36:11,860
But it actually did or they did a really good job with it

1265
01:36:11,860 --> 01:36:16,860
And it's like the slow down it is like era and it's like whoa shit is fun

1266
01:36:46,860 --> 01:36:52,100
say as much as I really want to say Kylie, I keep thinking that's a Euromix song that

1267
01:36:52,100 --> 01:36:57,380
we just kind of got, so I do have to say Take Me Away into the Night is my favorite as well.

1268
01:36:57,380 --> 01:37:00,140
And the video is kind of interesting, but what's weird about the video is in the video

1269
01:37:00,140 --> 01:37:03,860
it's a black chick singing, but in the other Four Strings video I've seen, Diving, it's

1270
01:37:03,860 --> 01:37:08,860
like this white girl with red hair. It's weird. So did they change singers or what did they

1271
01:37:08,860 --> 01:37:12,620
do? It's weird. You know what? They're messing with your head. They're messing with my head

1272
01:37:12,620 --> 01:37:16,340
and I don't like it. You know what I don't like about the Kylie video? I've decided.

1273
01:37:16,340 --> 01:37:23,460
makeup? Her makeup is awful and those earrings are gaudy. Will I in Heaven are really close

1274
01:37:23,460 --> 01:37:27,420
right there to Take Me Away. I love Will I. Maybe that is better than Take Me Away. I

1275
01:37:27,420 --> 01:37:35,020
don't know. Make up your mind. I can't. They're all good. You're being a woman. I can't. I

1276
01:37:35,020 --> 01:37:41,980
love Will I. I know I saw she even put it in the chat room which is why I said it. Let

1277
01:37:41,980 --> 01:37:48,180
them boobs, whatever, you guys are weird. Look at them. Your chat rooms are weird. www.calibamani.com

1278
01:37:48,180 --> 01:37:52,680
click on the ones on the chat. It's no silent, of course it's weird. I want to bring this

1279
01:37:52,680 --> 01:37:55,940
up real fast. There's some interesting 2DX news that hit this week. You guys have been

1280
01:37:55,940 --> 01:38:02,700
wondering what 2DX 7th style is? Do you guys want to know when 2DX 7th style is coming

1281
01:38:02,700 --> 01:38:06,660
out? Konami has made an announcement about it. After you vote for it. This is the deal. In

1282
01:38:06,660 --> 01:38:07,860
Order it.

1283
01:38:07,860 --> 01:38:09,660
Benmani style, put out the news this week.

1284
01:38:09,660 --> 01:38:11,340
Jamie, you want to run down by it?

1285
01:38:11,340 --> 01:38:13,420
I glanced at it.

1286
01:38:13,420 --> 01:38:15,220
I didn't bother translating the page yet,

1287
01:38:15,220 --> 01:38:18,020
because I'm just going to order it from Humaya.

1288
01:38:18,020 --> 01:38:20,980
But there's a big voting poll.

1289
01:38:20,980 --> 01:38:24,660
And if enough people vote, then they're

1290
01:38:24,660 --> 01:38:27,700
going to put out another 2DX.

1291
01:38:27,700 --> 01:38:30,260
Yeah, and I don't know if they're going to get enough.

1292
01:38:30,260 --> 01:38:33,020
Isn't it supposed to be like 7th and 8th?

1293
01:38:33,020 --> 01:38:35,140
Isn't it supposed to be something like 7th and 8th

1294
01:38:35,140 --> 01:38:36,140
mix together.

1295
01:38:36,140 --> 01:38:42,380
That's the rumor, but you know, I'm not horribly excited, because I know that not enough people

1296
01:38:42,380 --> 01:38:43,380
are going to vote for it.

1297
01:38:43,380 --> 01:38:48,740
Well, I don't know, if enough people vote for it, then it'll be good, but I'm just going

1298
01:38:48,740 --> 01:38:53,900
to order it from Himea anyway, because I already, you already know about my trouble with Konami

1299
01:38:53,900 --> 01:38:54,900
style.

1300
01:38:54,900 --> 01:38:59,500
Oh, you don't have the right kind of credit card, we're going to revoke your 2DX controller

1301
01:38:59,500 --> 01:39:00,500
order.

1302
01:39:00,500 --> 01:39:01,500
Bite me!

1303
01:39:01,500 --> 01:39:09,820
You know what's interesting is that a lot of this came up because 2DX, they announced

1304
01:39:09,820 --> 01:39:13,660
that they're going to make new controllers and suddenly people went, wait a minute Konami,

1305
01:39:13,660 --> 01:39:17,480
why is Konami making new 2DX arcade style controllers if they haven't put out a home

1306
01:39:17,480 --> 01:39:18,480
version forever?

1307
01:39:18,480 --> 01:39:21,520
And that's kind of where this came about is that it was like, okay, now maybe since they're

1308
01:39:21,520 --> 01:39:24,500
doing these controllers, they're going to do a new consumer style too.

1309
01:39:24,500 --> 01:39:29,340
Now with the new controllers though, then I might have to toss down the 400 to order

1310
01:39:29,340 --> 01:39:42,580
mine from Himea if you want to see the information on that you can head on over

1311
01:39:42,580 --> 01:39:46,140
to I'm just gonna tell you to go bimani style calm because they have the links

1312
01:39:46,140 --> 01:39:49,700
there on the front page which isn't loading for me right now bastards oh

1313
01:39:49,700 --> 01:39:57,420
well they have the links to Konami the site that you'll need so how about a

1315
01:40:03,180 --> 01:40:08,340

1316
01:40:08,340 --> 01:40:11,980
cut all the licensed tracks if they're having to scrounge to do this and that makes me a

1317
01:40:11,980 --> 01:40:18,700
sad little panda. Where the fuck is my Dance Maniacs home version you bastard? I just want

1318
01:40:18,700 --> 01:40:25,100
to play Last Message at home. This is like one of the few 7th stars I can pass. I can

1319
01:40:25,100 --> 01:40:34,820
pass like last message I can pass that monkey dance and uh what's the other seven I can

1320
01:40:34,820 --> 01:40:41,360
pass Rob? Please don't go. That's what I thought. Breaking my fingers working on Love Me Do

1321
01:40:41,360 --> 01:40:51,440
I gave up. Oh my god my fingers bleeding I cannot play the 2DX anymore. Oh my god I am

Eurobeat I like your and you know we need to do a shameless plug here for

1326
01:41:19,560 --> 01:41:27,740
forums that nobody goes to anymore agreed the only thing that lives on the

1327
01:41:27,740 --> 01:41:31,620
forums anymore is the quote thread which is I think the last thing that I saw in

1328
01:41:31,620 --> 01:41:36,260
the quote thread was me trying to do chat para para but you know what if the

1329
01:41:36,260 --> 01:41:41,540

1336
01:42:14,060 --> 01:42:27,460
Last week was interesting because of the Comcast problems we weren't able to get enough voters

1337
01:42:27,460 --> 01:42:31,760
from our chat room so we combined their votes with in-house voting which we haven't done

1338
01:42:31,760 --> 01:42:36,760
in a long time but we're going to go back to a strictly chat room vote tonight so make

1339
01:42:36,760 --> 01:42:41,340

1341
01:42:43,320 --> 01:42:49,440
week it came down to a tie between Loki's latest remix and Jamie's song and I picked

1342
01:42:49,440 --> 01:42:53,160
I picked Jamie's song because I felt bad she hadn't won in a while and I liked her song

1343
01:42:53,160 --> 01:42:54,160
anyway.

1344
01:42:54,160 --> 01:42:55,160
I got the pity vote.

1345
01:42:55,160 --> 01:42:56,160
She got a pity vote.

1346
01:42:56,160 --> 01:42:57,160
What?

1347
01:42:57,160 --> 01:42:58,160
Loki's song didn't suck.

1348
01:42:58,160 --> 01:42:59,160
Quit saying it.

1349
01:42:59,160 --> 01:43:00,160
He says his song sucked.

1350
01:43:00,160 --> 01:43:01,160
It didn't suck.

1351
01:43:01,160 --> 01:43:02,800
Alright, so here it is.

1352
01:43:02,800 --> 01:43:05,680
Here's last week's winner and the first song you can vote for tonight.

1353
01:43:05,680 --> 01:43:10,280
It's Free Fall featuring Jan Johnston, who I rather like, and this song is called Skydive.

1354
01:43:10,280 --> 01:43:11,280
Enjoy.

1355
01:43:11,280 --> 01:43:15,700
Actually, we're only gonna play a clip of it because it did win last week. So here you go

1356
01:43:41,280 --> 01:43:59,280
This is me with all the expectations We know the love we have to hold each other

1357
01:44:00,280 --> 01:44:03,280
Every time you've been loved No separate degrees

1358
01:44:03,280 --> 01:44:09,280
Now we're here, we have our role and we're here

1359
01:44:20,280 --> 01:44:24,280
Connect your words, I have them in the dark

1360
01:44:24,280 --> 01:44:29,780
The silence you smile, and even miss you in my sleep

1361
01:44:34,780 --> 01:44:39,780
No rush, no lust, no lie, this journey is all out

1362
01:44:39,780 --> 01:44:45,780
You're my hero, heaven did you come

1363
01:45:09,780 --> 01:45:29,580
All right, that was last week's winner, Jan Johnston with the band Free Fall with a song

1364
01:45:29,580 --> 01:45:31,220
called Skydive.

1365
01:45:31,220 --> 01:45:33,180
Next up is Loki's pick.

1366
01:45:33,180 --> 01:45:35,260
Loki, what did you pick for us tonight?

1367
01:45:35,260 --> 01:45:36,900
Guess what came out this week?

1368
01:45:36,900 --> 01:45:40,740
Yep, that's right a Yumi trance 3. Yes, that's right

1369
01:45:40,740 --> 01:45:44,740
I picked another Yumi trance song because I'm lazy and I don't care

1370
01:45:45,220 --> 01:45:49,900
So you get to listen to naturally the whipping bird mix because naturally is pretty cool

1371
01:45:49,900 --> 01:45:54,700
All right, here it is. Song number two in tonight's cage match. It's Yumi Hamasaki from

1372
01:47:19,900 --> 01:47:21,900
Oh

1373
01:50:19,900 --> 01:50:21,900
We can go

1374
01:50:21,900 --> 01:50:23,900
We can go

1375
01:50:23,900 --> 01:50:38,360
Alright gang, that was song number two in tonight's cage match.

1376
01:50:38,360 --> 01:50:43,100
New entry Ayumi Hamasaki from Cybertrance3 with Naturally the Wittenberg Mix.

1377
01:50:43,100 --> 01:50:46,500
Let's go around and see what the room thought of it, starting off with Who's Got a Mic?

1378
01:50:46,500 --> 01:50:47,500
Jamie.

1379
01:50:47,500 --> 01:50:48,500
It's Transtastic.

1380
01:50:48,500 --> 01:50:49,500
Um, nine.

1381
01:50:49,500 --> 01:51:03,500
I like the original naturally better, but this is still good. I give it an 8.

1382
01:51:03,500 --> 01:51:07,500
Alrighty. Violent Hyper Girl.

1383
01:51:07,500 --> 01:51:10,500
I think it's cool just because I like Ayumi.

1384
01:51:10,500 --> 01:51:12,500
And on a scale of 1 to 10, you give it a?

1385
01:51:12,500 --> 01:51:14,500
Probably a 7 or 8.

1386
01:51:14,500 --> 01:51:16,500
7 or 8, so 7 and a half.

1387
01:51:16,500 --> 01:51:17,500
Yeah.

1388
01:51:17,500 --> 01:51:19,500
You can do halves, it's acceptable.

1389
01:51:19,500 --> 01:51:21,500
Yay, good enough.

1390
01:51:21,500 --> 01:51:23,500
Bradley or Logie, whoever grabs the mic. Bradley?

1391
01:51:23,500 --> 01:51:26,500
It's not pretty good. I'll give it a nine.

1392
01:51:26,500 --> 01:51:32,500
Give it a nine. I think it was pretty rockin'. It's not my favorite song on the new Trance CD, but it's pretty good. Eight and a half.

1393
01:51:32,500 --> 01:51:35,500
Logie?

1394
01:51:35,500 --> 01:51:40,500
Motherfuckin' controller I slashed across the ground and that's bad.

1395
01:51:40,500 --> 01:51:43,500
Anyways, um, I give it a...

1396
01:51:43,500 --> 01:51:49,500
I don't give a crap because I picked it randomly out of the CD I downloaded, so...

1397
01:51:49,500 --> 01:51:51,500
Yeah.

1398
01:51:51,500 --> 01:51:53,500
I give it a...

1399
01:51:53,500 --> 01:51:55,500
9.

1400
01:51:55,500 --> 01:51:56,500
9.

1401
01:51:56,500 --> 01:51:58,500
I give the ferret sex a 10!

1402
01:51:58,500 --> 01:52:04,500
Alright, so there you have it, the votes for Yumi Hamasaki would naturally, but remember the ultimate decision is up to you.

1403
01:52:04,500 --> 01:52:13,500
And, uh, head on over to our chat room, www.calibomani.com, click on Orange Club, mental note, or you can write this down somewhere.

1404
01:52:13,500 --> 01:52:18,500
Flash game, Ferret Sex, the Flash game, for when the website comes up.

1405
01:52:18,500 --> 01:52:22,500
I'll work on that when we get our other website up, which we've been needing to do for a month.

1406
01:52:22,500 --> 01:52:25,500
Or even, like, just like an animated GIF or something.

1407
01:52:25,500 --> 01:52:27,500
What, puppy?

1408
01:52:27,500 --> 01:52:29,500
No, I'm not gonna do that.

1409
01:52:29,500 --> 01:52:37,500
Next up is my pick and I assure you what will go down in history is a Rob classic pick tonight.

1410
01:52:37,500 --> 01:52:47,500
Don't blame me because I asked the room, do you want my pick tonight to be something trance or something booty and foul?

1411
01:52:47,500 --> 01:52:51,500
And they picked booty and foul, so this is the song you get.

1412
01:52:51,500 --> 01:52:57,500
If my baby mama can make solo bass, I think this song can make solo bass.

1413
01:52:57,500 --> 01:53:02,780
So this is my pick for tonight, it's a group call, and I have to thank the Ice Queen, he

1414
01:53:02,780 --> 01:53:05,700
recommended this one to me, Ice Queen recommended me this one.

1415
01:53:05,700 --> 01:53:09,140
This is Fanny Pack, with a song called Camel Toe.

1416
01:53:09,140 --> 01:53:11,480
And enjoy camel tell enjoy

1417
01:53:39,140 --> 01:53:45,620
That's right, uh-huh, uh-huh Mm-hmm, that's right, uh-huh, uh-huh

1418
01:53:45,620 --> 01:53:48,620
Walking down the street, something caught my eye

1419
01:53:48,620 --> 01:53:52,620
A growing epidemic that really ain't fly

1420
01:53:52,620 --> 01:53:56,620
This little-aged lady, I gotta be blunt

1421
01:53:56,620 --> 01:53:59,620
A Spanish biker, sure as word, creeping up the front

1422
01:53:59,620 --> 01:54:03,620
I could see her uterus, her pants was too tight

1423
01:54:03,620 --> 01:54:07,620
She mustn't own pennies if we're not up in sight

1424
01:54:07,620 --> 01:54:11,020
You walk right by, the poor woman didn't know

1425
01:54:11,020 --> 01:54:14,520
She had a frontal wedgie, a camel toe

1426
01:54:14,520 --> 01:54:18,520
Mm-hmm, that's right, uh-huh, oh no

1427
01:54:18,520 --> 01:54:22,020
Think she's dope, girl, you got a camel toe

1428
01:54:22,020 --> 01:54:26,020
Mm-hmm, that's right, uh-huh, oh no

1429
01:54:26,020 --> 01:54:29,520
Think she's dope, girl, you got a camel toe

1430
01:54:29,520 --> 01:54:33,020
Girl, that's gotta hurt, take some time in the dust

1431
01:54:33,020 --> 01:54:36,520
Can't you see people staring and making the fuss

1432
01:54:36,520 --> 01:54:40,020
I cannot believe my eyes had to take a second glance

1433
01:54:40,020 --> 01:54:42,020
Is your crotch hungry, girl?

1434
01:54:42,020 --> 01:54:43,520
Cuz you're eating your pants

1435
01:54:43,520 --> 01:54:47,020
Do you enjoy the commotion and the tension it brings?

1436
01:54:47,020 --> 01:54:51,020
The only lips I wanna see are the ones that sing

1437
01:54:51,020 --> 01:54:55,020
In public, put it on and x-ray the show

1438
01:54:55,020 --> 01:54:58,520
Cursing people out with your camel toe

1439
01:54:58,520 --> 01:55:02,520
Mm-hmm, that's right, uh-huh, oh no

1440
01:55:02,520 --> 01:55:09,840
Fix your toe, girl, you've got a camel toe Mm-hmm, that's right, uh-huh, oh, no

1441
01:55:09,840 --> 01:55:17,240
Fix your toe, girl, you've got a camel toe First I explain by the looks of things These girls don't forgot how to dress

1442
01:55:17,240 --> 01:55:21,000
A little too quick, wearin' a pool comin' for us This is causin' me much distress

1443
01:55:21,000 --> 01:55:24,440
Won't say it is alright, that's fine Everybody tryna get a good look

1444
01:55:24,440 --> 01:55:28,200
I can see everything through the panty-cling Every cranny and every nook

1445
01:55:28,200 --> 01:55:30,200
Better stay quick, let me tell you something fine

1446
01:55:30,200 --> 01:55:32,200
Check the area, it's pubic

1447
01:55:32,200 --> 01:55:34,200
And you get your pain drawn up in the blood

1448
01:55:34,200 --> 01:55:36,200
So twist it up like Rubik's

1449
01:55:36,200 --> 01:55:38,200
Say words to your vice, it's not getting nice

1450
01:55:38,200 --> 01:55:40,200
Let me put you on and we know

1451
01:55:40,200 --> 01:55:41,200
Girls don't sleep unless you feel sleep

1452
01:55:41,200 --> 01:55:43,200
Watch out for the camel toe

1453
01:55:43,200 --> 01:55:45,200
Mm-hmm, that's right

1454
01:55:45,200 --> 01:55:47,200
Uh-huh, I don't know

1455
01:55:47,200 --> 01:55:50,200
Think you so, girl, you got a camel toe

1456
01:55:50,200 --> 01:55:52,200
Mm-hmm, that's right

1457
01:55:52,200 --> 01:55:54,200
Uh-huh, I don't know

1458
01:55:54,200 --> 01:55:57,200
Think you so, girl, you got a camel toe

1459
01:55:57,200 --> 01:56:23,300
Alright, that was the last song in tonight's cage match.

1460
01:56:23,300 --> 01:56:26,180
My pick, Fanny Pack with Camel Toe.

1461
01:56:26,180 --> 01:56:31,820

ooh not by me though we'll talk to somebody who's not here tonight okay

1464
01:56:42,500 --> 01:56:49,500
on a scale of one to ten I don't think that numbers can quantify it it gets a

1465
01:56:49,500 --> 01:56:54,620
it gets a beef of booty all right I guess it translates to an eight okay

1466
01:56:54,620 --> 01:57:01,460
Aaron I don't know the first time I've heard something like that in a while

1467
01:57:01,460 --> 01:57:08,500
yeah I guess you have a new term for that type of thing and things besides

1468
01:57:08,500 --> 01:57:15,980
saying that girls wear their pants too tight these days and I give it an 8 because that was a good laugh

1469
01:57:15,980 --> 01:57:17,980
Alright, 8 for a good laugh.

1470
01:57:17,980 --> 01:57:19,980
Tuppy!

1471
01:57:21,980 --> 01:57:28,980
Just the fact that the name of the song is Camel Toe is ridiculous to itself.

1472
01:57:28,980 --> 01:57:31,980
I mean, come on. What next?

1473
01:57:31,980 --> 01:57:36,980
I mean, next thing you know there's going to be a song called Blue Balls.

1474
01:57:36,980 --> 01:57:39,980
There may well be.

1475
01:57:39,980 --> 01:57:42,980
Jamie's threatening to write it right now.

1476
01:57:42,980 --> 01:57:50,980
The next remix I make will be, insert song name here, The Blues Ball Mix.

1477
01:57:50,980 --> 01:57:53,980
Ooh, it'd be even better if it was a blues song.

1478
01:57:53,980 --> 01:57:55,980
Let Puppy finish his thought.

1479
01:57:55,980 --> 01:57:58,980
There's a thought?

1480
01:57:58,980 --> 01:57:59,980
He has to give a number.

1481
01:57:59,980 --> 01:58:02,980
I didn't know I would.

1482
01:58:02,980 --> 01:58:03,980
3.159.

1483
01:58:03,980 --> 01:58:04,980
Alright.

1484
01:58:04,980 --> 01:58:05,980
Uh, Bradley.

1485
01:58:05,980 --> 01:58:06,980
This is good.

1486
01:58:06,980 --> 01:58:10,980
I'm still thinking.

1487
01:58:10,980 --> 01:58:14,980
Ghetto booty. Booty ghetto.

1488
01:58:14,980 --> 01:58:18,980
Let's just...

1489
01:58:18,980 --> 01:58:22,980
Let's give it a seven. Or an eight. Or a four. Or a three. Or a seven. Or a twenty.

1490
01:58:22,980 --> 01:58:26,980
Or a nine. Or nothing.

1491
01:58:26,980 --> 01:58:30,980
Best song ever! Ten. Loki.

1492
01:58:30,980 --> 01:58:34,980
Um.

1493
01:58:34,980 --> 01:58:43,980
Yeah. You know, the white in me says seven, but the ghetto black in me says ten.

1494
01:58:43,980 --> 01:58:46,980
So what's that average to? 9.9?

1495
01:58:46,980 --> 01:58:53,980
Uh...er...nine? Wait. Nine and a half.

1496
01:58:53,980 --> 01:58:55,980
Alright.

1497
01:58:55,980 --> 01:58:59,980
Okay, here we go. Let's recap. And I'll...

1498
01:58:59,980 --> 01:59:04,480
Well, for those of you that haven't voted before, you have to send a private message to me in the chat room.

1499
01:59:04,480 --> 01:59:08,480
You have to send it over a private message or it doesn't count. If you say it publicly in the room, it doesn't count.

1500
01:59:08,480 --> 01:59:14,980
And I know we have some new chatters in there tonight, so I'll type out how you do that for those of you that don't know.

1501
01:59:14,980 --> 01:59:17,480
And sorry, but you can't vote for Hollick.

1502
01:59:17,480 --> 01:59:19,980
All right, let's recap, shall we, real fast.

1503
01:59:19,980 --> 01:59:20,980
Why do people even bother?

1504
01:59:20,980 --> 01:59:24,980
Song number one, last week's winner, Free Fall, featuring Jams Johnston with Skydive.

1505
01:59:24,980 --> 01:59:38,320
All right, song number two that you can vote for tonight is Yumi Hamasaki from Cybertrance

1506
01:59:38,320 --> 01:59:50,980
3 with a song called Naturally.

1507
01:59:50,980 --> 01:59:54,280
Song number three you can vote for tonight is a band called Fanny Pack with the song

1508
01:59:54,280 --> 01:59:55,280
Camel Toe.

1509
01:59:55,280 --> 02:00:07,400
I wonder what's gonna win.

1510
02:00:07,400 --> 02:00:08,400
Vote now.

1511
02:00:08,400 --> 02:00:13,640
Place vote now.

1512
02:00:13,640 --> 02:00:20,040
In the meantime, Loki, why don't you tell us what's going on in the Sim world?

1513
02:00:20,040 --> 02:00:23,160
Some piece of wire doesn't want to go through my hole.

1514
02:00:23,160 --> 02:00:25,200
Anyways, in the controller.

1515
02:00:25,200 --> 02:00:26,440
Hole in the controller.

1516
02:00:29,440 --> 02:00:32,560
Now, there's a new StepMania version.

1517
02:00:32,560 --> 02:00:37,320
And they did stuff, and stuff happened, and yeah.

1518
02:00:37,320 --> 02:00:38,920
Don't care.

1519
02:00:38,920 --> 02:00:41,920
Also, oh wait, I know you're going to love this.

1520
02:00:41,920 --> 02:00:48,400
New TourneyMix, TourneyMix 4th Plus, it's a DDR joke.

1521
02:00:48,400 --> 02:00:54,040
OK, anyways, yeah, DDR-EI, or East Coast Invasions,

1522
02:00:54,040 --> 02:00:56,600
Turny Mix, Fourth Plus, Asian Mix.

1523
02:00:56,600 --> 02:00:57,480
What?

1524
02:00:57,480 --> 02:00:59,800
Asian, I kid you not, Asian Mix.

1525
02:00:59,800 --> 02:01:03,000
All the music in it must be sung by an Asian singer.

1526
02:01:03,000 --> 02:01:07,480
So it has to be in Japanese or Chinese, Korean.

1527
02:01:07,480 --> 02:01:09,760
They're trying to control the track.

1528
02:01:09,760 --> 02:01:15,640
It's trying to, they're trying to basically spark

1529
02:01:15,640 --> 02:01:17,520
interest for Turny Mix 5.

1530
02:01:17,520 --> 02:01:25,520
So basically, this is going to be the poorly run stepchild that's in the middle.

1531
02:01:25,520 --> 02:01:29,520
For this Asian mix, there better be really, really good Japanese or Korean songs,

1532
02:01:29,520 --> 02:01:37,520
because we all know where Chinese pop went, or is going.

1533
02:01:37,520 --> 02:01:44,520
But it seems like, judging from the last remix, a lot of people don't have that good a song taste.

1534
02:01:44,520 --> 02:01:50,520
You know, technically you can have Russian music too, because part of Russia is in Asia, so we can have tattoo!

1535
02:01:55,520 --> 02:02:06,520
But yeah, and obviously, the only good Chinese songs there are, are basically slow songs and some trance slash techno, but not much.

1536
02:02:07,520 --> 02:02:10,520
Oh, I haven't listened to Thai pop so, not very much.

1537
02:02:10,520 --> 02:02:17,360
Yeah, India's in Asia too, so dollar-mendy all around.

1538
02:02:17,360 --> 02:02:18,360
Tunac.

1539
02:02:18,360 --> 02:02:21,120
Was this mentioned in the chatroom?

1540
02:02:21,120 --> 02:02:22,120
Tunac, Tunac.

1541
02:02:22,120 --> 02:02:24,840
Oh, get over, Tunac, Tunac, already.

1542
02:02:24,840 --> 02:02:25,840
Come on.

1543
02:02:25,840 --> 02:02:27,320
That song is fucking used.

1544
02:02:27,320 --> 02:02:28,320
It's done.

1545
02:02:28,320 --> 02:02:33,280
Hello, and welcome to a joke that is fucking moldy.

1546
02:02:33,280 --> 02:02:34,280
It's done.

1547
02:02:34,280 --> 02:02:36,280
I'm sick of Tunac, Tunac.

1548
02:02:36,280 --> 02:02:38,560
Bring out my pogs.

1549
02:02:38,560 --> 02:02:39,560
Yeah.

1550
02:02:39,560 --> 02:02:45,060
Let's play Magic the Gathering and listen to our, you know, Lilith Fair music while we, you know...

1551
02:02:45,060 --> 02:02:46,560
You mean Dungeons and Dragons?

1552
02:02:46,560 --> 02:02:48,560
Yeah, play Dungeons and Dragons to neck to neck.

1553
02:02:48,560 --> 02:02:50,560
7 Mary 3 and Bush.

1554
02:02:50,560 --> 02:02:57,560
Yeah, while we listen to 7 Mary 3 and Bush and watch MTV playing music videos.

1555
02:02:57,560 --> 02:03:00,060
All day long.

1556
02:03:00,060 --> 02:03:05,060
Anyway, I agree that Trinity Makes 4 Plus is a stupid idea. Talk about unnecessary things.

1557
02:03:05,060 --> 02:03:07,560
I mean, honestly.

1558
02:03:07,560 --> 02:03:13,560
I mean, what useless songs are going to come out of this, honestly?

1559
02:03:13,560 --> 02:03:14,560
It's horrid.

1560
02:03:14,560 --> 02:03:15,560
I know.

1561
02:03:15,560 --> 02:03:17,720
We're going to see a gazillion Ayumi songs.

1562
02:03:17,720 --> 02:03:23,720
And if you think I'm going to jump off my ass to make you your stupid Max 2 USA license

1563
02:03:23,720 --> 02:03:25,080
tracks, think again.

1564
02:03:25,080 --> 02:03:29,180
I don't care, because I haven't played StepMania in three months, and I am not going to make

1565
02:03:29,180 --> 02:03:30,180
your stupid tracks.

1566
02:03:30,180 --> 02:03:36,440
So you're going to have to wait for DDRUK to make them, because they're good at everything.

1567
02:03:36,440 --> 02:03:38,440
Even though I made them the last two times, and they took credit!

1568
02:03:38,440 --> 02:03:40,440
Took credit!

1569
02:03:40,440 --> 02:03:42,440
Because they said, oh, they were out of sync!

1570
02:03:42,440 --> 02:03:44,440
YOU'RE out of sync!

1571
02:03:44,440 --> 02:03:46,440
I'm done.

1572
02:03:48,440 --> 02:03:54,440
It's not just the Yumi songs, there's probably gonna be a lot of stupid Pop, Finkle, SES, Shinwa songs.

1573
02:03:54,440 --> 02:03:57,440
Last call for cage match votes in the chat room.

1574
02:03:57,440 --> 02:03:59,440
I have a challenge to issue.

1575
02:03:59,440 --> 02:04:02,440
I want Dragon Ash or MaliceMizer.

1576
02:04:02,440 --> 02:04:10,440
I would love to see some visual kei done, or I would love to see just some good, you

1577
02:04:10,440 --> 02:04:14,600
know, uber goth j-rock make it into the turning mix.

1578
02:04:14,600 --> 02:04:16,440
See how they pull that off.

1579
02:04:16,440 --> 02:04:22,000
Like, you know, have like the Beasts of Blood video playing in the background or something.

1580
02:04:22,000 --> 02:04:24,480
Here's the microphone!

1581
02:04:24,480 --> 02:04:29,920
What am I going to do with it?

1582
02:04:29,920 --> 02:04:30,920
Like this?

1583
02:04:30,920 --> 02:04:41,320
Alright, would you guys like to hear who got the cage match tonight because we have collected

1584
02:04:41,320 --> 02:04:42,320
all the votes.

1585
02:04:42,320 --> 02:04:43,320
I gave the last call.

1586
02:04:43,320 --> 02:04:44,320
Wow.

1587
02:04:44,320 --> 02:04:45,320
Sure.

1588
02:04:45,320 --> 02:04:47,600
Yeah, I just try to wrap it up quick now because we tend to do FUs and cage match back to back

1589
02:04:47,600 --> 02:04:51,640
and I have to close out all the private messages for FUs as if you needed to know that.

1590
02:04:51,640 --> 02:04:54,440
So here we go, I haven't gotten any more votes.

1591
02:04:54,440 --> 02:04:58,400
So here is tonight's winner, are you guys ready for it?

1592
02:04:58,400 --> 02:05:01,640
It is a tie.

1593
02:05:01,640 --> 02:05:02,600
Oh, lovely.

1594
02:05:02,600 --> 02:05:05,560
Dun, dun, dun.

1595
02:05:05,560 --> 02:05:06,680
No.

1596
02:05:06,680 --> 02:05:10,480
The way the rules go is that the host whose song did not tie

1597
02:05:10,480 --> 02:05:12,080
will break the tie.

1598
02:05:12,080 --> 02:05:21,680
And tonight, song one, song one that tied was Camel Toe.

1599
02:05:21,680 --> 02:05:23,800
Figures.

1600
02:05:23,800 --> 02:05:30,080
Song number two that tied tonight was, if the damn thing will play.

1601
02:05:30,080 --> 02:05:31,080
Let me guess, Yumi?

1602
02:05:31,080 --> 02:05:32,080
Yes, it was Yumi.

1603
02:05:32,080 --> 02:05:38,660
So it means Yumi is swimming out and she gets to break the tie, and hopefully she remembers

1604
02:05:38,660 --> 02:05:44,700
the favor I gave her last week, but not to influence her vote or anything.

1605
02:05:44,700 --> 02:05:46,380
Give it to the butt.

1606
02:05:46,380 --> 02:05:47,380
Give it to the booty.

1607
02:05:47,380 --> 02:05:48,380
Give it to the booty.

1608
02:05:48,380 --> 02:05:49,380
All right.

1609
02:05:49,380 --> 02:06:02,180
is this week's cage match winner so camel toe wins by a vote of one. I also call that

1610
02:06:02,180 --> 02:06:07,460
needs the F.U. music for the chat room okay that will be the F.U. music for the chat room

1611
02:06:07,460 --> 02:06:15,860
tonight that's fine okay if you want to if you want to visit our webcam www.calibomani.com

1612
02:06:15,860 --> 02:06:19,000
click on orange lounge and click on chat. The site you can see on the cam right now

1613
02:06:19,000 --> 02:06:24,980
is puppy hunched over with a microphone, Loki soldering in the background. Erin has been

1614
02:06:24,980 --> 02:06:29,920
on and off the cam. Jamie's hiding from it. Jamie hides from the cam so she randomly holds

1615
02:06:29,920 --> 02:06:38,680
objects up. Alright, guess what's coming up when we take this break kids? After this break.

1616
02:06:38,680 --> 02:06:44,480
Come on, we do it every week. FUs. We all know it, why do we have to guess? Because

1617
02:06:44,480 --> 02:06:45,480
It's the fun part.

1618
02:06:45,480 --> 02:06:46,480
Alright.

1619
02:06:46,480 --> 02:06:47,480
Give me.

1620
02:06:47,480 --> 02:06:48,480
Yes, Jamie?

1621
02:06:48,480 --> 02:06:50,160
I have a microphone now, so just play my damn music.

1622
02:06:50,160 --> 02:06:51,160
Well, we're not doing any FUs yet.

1623
02:06:51,160 --> 02:06:52,160
We're taking a break first.

1624
02:06:52,160 --> 02:06:53,160
I don't care.

1625
02:06:53,160 --> 02:06:54,160
Alright.

1626
02:06:54,160 --> 02:06:59,240
Uh, in this break, we're going to hear more Max 2 USA music, and this is a lot of songs.

1627
02:06:59,240 --> 02:07:00,240
You know what?

1628
02:07:00,240 --> 02:07:01,240
What?

1629
02:07:01,240 --> 02:07:03,520
I don't understand why they don't just let me pick all the music.

1630
02:07:03,520 --> 02:07:04,520
What do you mean?

1631
02:07:04,520 --> 02:07:05,520
For Max 2?

1632
02:07:05,520 --> 02:07:06,520
No.

1633
02:07:06,520 --> 02:07:07,520
I don't like in general.

1634
02:07:07,520 --> 02:07:10,600
I should, like, petition Konami to let me pick everything.

1635
02:07:10,600 --> 02:07:17,260
The only thing that some of the songs are good for being picked for is like picking

1636
02:07:17,260 --> 02:07:18,260
noses.

1637
02:07:18,260 --> 02:07:19,260
I don't know.

1638
02:07:19,260 --> 02:07:21,700
They're all really good songs though, so go ahead and play them.

1639
02:07:21,700 --> 02:07:23,220
Alright, here we go.

1640
02:07:23,220 --> 02:07:25,620
In this break you're going to hear a lot of songs that were requested.

1641
02:07:25,620 --> 02:07:33,100
Tomorrow Perfume in this break, Will I, and SFMP with Try To Love You.

1642
02:07:33,100 --> 02:07:34,560
You're listening to Orange Lombs Radio.

1643
02:07:34,560 --> 02:07:37,000
Tell a friend we're on the air.

1644
02:07:37,000 --> 02:07:39,500
We'll be back after this.

1645
02:07:39,500 --> 02:07:40,500
Thanks.

1646
02:09:09,500 --> 02:09:39,000
You don't know what fucking for, from the fucking one you know

1647
02:09:39,000 --> 02:09:40,440
Coming like the bass real low

1648
02:09:40,440 --> 02:09:42,040
Trips, the tracks, the trips, the track, the track

1649
02:09:42,040 --> 02:09:43,720
A weak weapon, acting like a fake lady

1650
02:09:43,720 --> 02:09:45,400
Get down from the tip of the ear

1651
02:09:45,400 --> 02:09:47,480
You can't lose me, baby, it's my world

1652
02:09:47,480 --> 02:09:49,560
Cause I ain't nothing like a punk, the sister girl

1653
02:09:49,560 --> 02:09:51,320
The motivation gets you, hits you where it hurts

1654
02:09:51,320 --> 02:09:53,400
Yeah, it's the first time in real life, just the first time in real life

1655
02:09:53,400 --> 02:09:55,400
You're my favorite sister

1656
02:09:55,400 --> 02:09:57,400
I'm just trying to love you

1657
02:09:57,400 --> 02:10:01,400
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

1658
02:10:01,400 --> 02:10:03,400
Why don't you show me

1659
02:10:03,400 --> 02:10:05,400
I'm just trying to love you

1660
02:10:35,400 --> 02:10:39,400
I ever loved you again

1661
02:10:41,400 --> 02:10:46,400
Will we be together again?

1662
02:10:48,400 --> 02:10:52,400
Thought the love we had was strong

1663
02:10:54,400 --> 02:10:57,400
Tell me what's wrong

1664
02:10:57,400 --> 02:11:00,400
Where did we go wrong?

1665
02:11:27,400 --> 02:11:43,400
Will I, Will I, Will I Will I, Will I, Will I, Will I, Will I

1666
02:11:43,400 --> 02:11:56,400
Will I ever love you again Will we be together again

1667
02:11:56,400 --> 02:12:02,400
Sorry, the one we had was strong

1668
02:12:02,400 --> 02:12:05,400
And tell me what's wrong

1669
02:12:35,400 --> 02:12:49,560
Bitch, get a new song, an open letter from Orange Lounge Radio.

1670
02:12:49,560 --> 02:12:54,480
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio episode number 62 in progress.

1671
02:12:54,480 --> 02:12:57,720
And Jamie, do you know what time it is?

1672
02:12:57,720 --> 02:12:58,720
Fuck you.

1673
02:12:58,720 --> 02:13:00,720
Actually, I don't have the music queued up yet.

1674
02:13:00,720 --> 02:13:05,560
You're supposed to take longer than that to answer the question.

1675
02:13:05,560 --> 02:13:08,080
It's time for me to throw a ferret at Puppy.

1676
02:13:08,080 --> 02:13:09,080
Alright.

1677
02:13:09,080 --> 02:13:10,560
Okay, now I'm ready.

1678
02:13:10,560 --> 02:13:12,160
Jamie, what time is it?

1679
02:13:12,160 --> 02:13:13,160
I don't care.

1680
02:13:13,160 --> 02:13:14,160
Come on.

1681
02:13:14,160 --> 02:13:15,160
Uh-uh, you're no fun.

1682
02:13:15,160 --> 02:13:16,160
You weren't ready.

1683
02:13:16,160 --> 02:13:17,160
Jamie.

1684
02:13:17,160 --> 02:13:22,200
It's time for me to get a ferret thrown at my hand.

1685
02:13:22,200 --> 02:13:25,200
Stop throwing ferret at Nate!

1686
02:13:25,200 --> 02:13:26,200
Oh, this is bad.

1687
02:13:26,200 --> 02:13:27,200
Here is justice.

1688
02:13:27,200 --> 02:13:28,200
Here is luck.

1689
02:13:28,200 --> 02:13:29,200
Oh, no!

1690
02:13:29,200 --> 02:13:30,200
Look at the camera!

1691
02:13:30,200 --> 02:13:31,200
This is fucked up.

1692
02:13:31,200 --> 02:13:32,200
Camera, away from me!

1693
02:13:32,200 --> 02:13:33,200
No!

1694
02:13:33,200 --> 02:13:34,200
Put it back where it was.

1695
02:13:34,200 --> 02:13:35,200
Ahem.

1696
02:13:35,200 --> 02:13:36,200
No, put it back the way it was!

1697
02:13:36,200 --> 02:13:37,200
Okay.

1698
02:13:37,200 --> 02:13:38,200
Ahem.

1699
02:13:38,200 --> 02:13:39,200
Oh, yeah.

1700
02:13:39,200 --> 02:13:52,320
It's time for me to be angsty, huh?

1701
02:13:52,320 --> 02:13:56,440
I haven't really had that bad of a week, but okay, stop that.

1702
02:13:56,440 --> 02:14:05,560
First off, a big F-you goes to puppy for throwing a ferret at my boob, and for throwing a ferret

1703
02:14:05,560 --> 02:14:07,520
at violent hyper girl's ass.

1704
02:14:07,520 --> 02:14:09,040
You threw it.

1705
02:14:09,040 --> 02:14:14,120
But you were the target, so it's your fault.

1706
02:14:14,120 --> 02:14:16,240
Your fault for...stop it.

1707
02:14:16,240 --> 02:14:17,240
Okay.

1708
02:14:17,240 --> 02:14:22,240
Another one goes for the rice I was cooking for being too wet.

1709
02:14:22,240 --> 02:14:27,240
That's my fault because I put in too much water.

1710
02:14:27,240 --> 02:14:32,240
I can't help it, the rice is just so hot.

1711
02:14:32,240 --> 02:14:37,240
And it couldn't help being moist because I was touching it.

1712
02:14:37,240 --> 02:14:42,240
I was rolling it around and making balls with it.

1713
02:14:42,240 --> 02:14:52,240
Anyway, another F.E. goes to being hot, because I am right now.

1714
02:14:52,240 --> 02:14:57,040
Another one goes toward my laundry for not being dry, so I'm drying it again.

1715
02:14:57,040 --> 02:15:05,240
Another F.E. goes toward ferret sex.

1716
02:15:05,240 --> 02:15:13,360
if he goes toward all the people who are not signed up for my message board it's

1717
02:15:13,360 --> 02:15:17,280
roleplay that's our soccer.com

1718
02:15:20,280 --> 02:15:25,240
I think I'm gonna throw out of our way I want to form a sexual place sexual role

1719
02:15:25,240 --> 02:15:28,760
play on there I'm gonna make it hidden for all of you people who are into the

1720
02:15:28,760 --> 02:15:34,720
kinky crap if there's gonna be one for four tops and one for bottoms and then

1721
02:16:04,720 --> 02:16:09,040
the whole time here I was like okay you can get off you are not a hemorrhoid I

1722
02:16:09,040 --> 02:16:19,360
am too young you know and then really I think that's about it oh yeah I think if

1723
02:16:19,360 --> 02:16:24,120
you go through my sleep pattern which is gonna hopefully be corrected and I got a

1724
02:16:24,120 --> 02:16:35,120
really cool hat okay bye all right next up is Loki yeah anyways I think I'm

1725
02:16:35,120 --> 02:16:41,480
wrapped around you here okay yeah I'm trying to get to my first F you here I

1726
02:16:41,480 --> 02:16:48,320
just have to find something there it is okay can you turn down the music like

1727
02:16:48,320 --> 02:16:58,940
off. First F you of the week goes to Konami. Mainly the group System SF. I don't know who

1728
02:16:58,940 --> 02:17:04,340
the fuck you think you are, but I don't like you blatantly ripping off other songs. Really

1729
02:17:04,340 --> 02:17:11,980
I don't. This piracy stuff has to stop. Now, the song I'm going to play for you is by another

1730
02:17:11,980 --> 02:17:18,860
group with a very similar name to System SF. It's called System F. They predated you

1731
02:17:18,860 --> 02:17:24,540
by five years. So here's their song and it's also their very big hit song called Out of

1732
02:17:24,540 --> 02:17:31,540
the blue. See if this sounds familiar.

1733
02:17:54,540 --> 02:18:19,700
It's freaking feelings won't fade you goddamn retard you didn't do anything to change the

1734
02:18:19,700 --> 02:18:24,300
song at all you blatantly stole it you can't say that you covered it because well there's

1735
02:18:24,300 --> 02:18:27,180
There's no scene, so you suck.

1736
02:18:27,180 --> 02:18:28,820
Come up with some original shit.

1737
02:18:28,820 --> 02:18:32,320
I'm sure Look to the Skies will probably rip off of something else, but I have to find

1738
02:18:32,320 --> 02:18:33,320
it first.

1739
02:18:33,320 --> 02:18:35,460
So you're lucky for now.

1740
02:18:35,460 --> 02:18:39,700
I'm about to expose you.

1741
02:18:39,700 --> 02:18:44,700
But anyways, yes, I am very pissed off at the fact that you blatantly ripped off Out

1742
02:18:44,700 --> 02:18:45,700
of the Blue.

1743
02:18:45,700 --> 02:18:51,780
So that's enough of that, and sorry about the Bawani Cell thing.

1744
02:18:51,780 --> 02:18:56,060
F.U. them for having their god damn music on their front page. I hate that god damn

1745
02:18:56,060 --> 02:19:02,720
music. Be like DDRMania X and keep it turned off unless I want it turned on. Or changes

1746
02:19:02,720 --> 02:19:07,720
to something else, you know, something catchy. Also, F.U.

1747
02:19:07,720 --> 02:19:11,920
One little comment, sorry. I thought that the whole deal of having music play on your

1748
02:19:11,920 --> 02:19:16,600
main page went out when people stopped using GeoCities.

1749
02:19:16,600 --> 02:19:20,520
Well it came back with people using Flash on their pages.

1750
02:19:20,520 --> 02:19:26,080
came back with Zenga and Shockwave actually say but anyways no but my cell

1751
02:19:26,080 --> 02:19:31,720
rocks other than their little music change the music you can be perfect fu

1752
02:19:31,720 --> 02:19:42,120
for must be first off for the stages at RV GL still being kind of slanted

1753
02:19:42,120 --> 02:19:58,120
FU the stupid drivers because I hate you everywhere, and there's all types of drivers and I think

1754
02:19:58,120 --> 02:20:03,960
I yelled at you all today, you know, whether it be, you know, the stupid Asian person that

1755
02:20:03,960 --> 02:20:04,960
had the...

1756
02:20:04,960 --> 02:20:05,960
It's Asian women mothers!

1757
02:20:05,960 --> 02:20:12,960
I don't know. Anyways, this stupid guy who has the rice rocket thing, or not really a rice rocket, but it sounded like...

1758
02:20:12,960 --> 02:20:13,960
The fart cannon!

1759
02:20:13,960 --> 02:20:15,960
Yes, it sounded like the fart cannon.

1760
02:20:15,960 --> 02:20:18,960
The fart cannon and the bleacher.

1761
02:20:18,960 --> 02:20:21,960
And, uh, F.U. to like...

1762
02:20:21,960 --> 02:20:28,960
You have to quote Jahi on this one. A hole in your muffler does not make a modification.

1763
02:20:28,960 --> 02:20:39,960
No, but anyways, um, FU2, uh, I don't know. I got thrown off when people started talking.

1764
02:20:40,960 --> 02:20:47,960
Um, oh, I know. FU2 is a stupid bitch that, like, ran over a curb at work.

1765
02:20:47,960 --> 02:20:58,960
It totally shattered it all and now my friend's probably going to get blamed for it because they have a giant bus and it's going to look like the bus ran over it even though it's a delivery man so that kind of sucks.

1766
02:20:58,960 --> 02:21:08,960
Fuck you the G4 because you still suck. You haven't heeded any of my advice and you can burn in hell.

1767
02:21:08,960 --> 02:21:12,960
You don't even have any new programming. You're talking about what happened at E3.

1768
02:21:12,960 --> 02:21:22,960
Okay, E3's been over for a while now, okay? E3 is not breaking news, okay?

1769
02:21:22,960 --> 02:21:28,960
And to say that you have new daily content is a lie anyways, because you film your shows like once every month.

1770
02:21:28,960 --> 02:21:32,960
And then repeat them over and over and over and over and over again.

1771
02:21:32,960 --> 02:21:39,960
So, playing full motion video, or not necessarily full motion video, but playing video game

1772
02:21:39,960 --> 02:21:43,960
screenshots to music does not constitute a show.

1773
02:21:43,960 --> 02:21:45,960
So please stop.

1774
02:21:45,960 --> 02:21:51,960
And, um, what's that like?

1775
02:21:51,960 --> 02:21:54,960
They're eating Mike and Ikes with chopsticks.

1776
02:21:54,960 --> 02:21:56,960
Stop being Asian.

1777
02:21:56,960 --> 02:21:58,960
I don't think she can help that.

1778
02:21:58,960 --> 02:22:01,960
Stop talking about puppies.

1779
02:22:01,960 --> 02:22:20,960
But, um, uh, yeah, I don't know, um, FU to our racist neighbor, and, uh, I'm done. I don't have anything to bitch about right now, cause it's been coming to me, it's just like, yeah.

1780
02:22:20,960 --> 02:22:26,960
All right. My turn.

1781
02:22:26,960 --> 02:22:28,960
This song makes me want to eat some beef.

1782
02:22:28,960 --> 02:22:35,960
My FUs are pretty quick this week. FU to the fact that everything in this goddamn town closes so early. I hate that shit.

1783
02:22:35,960 --> 02:22:41,960
And I know I've said FU about this before, but I'm saying it again because it's still true. This town sucks.

1784
02:22:41,960 --> 02:22:48,960
So that's my first FU. My second FU goes to two things that happened in San Francisco.

1785
02:22:48,960 --> 02:22:59,160
There's the Wholesome Street Fair, which happened today, and the Castro Street Fair, which happens

1786
02:22:59,160 --> 02:23:00,160
next Sunday.

1787
02:23:00,160 --> 02:23:02,820
Why does this shit happen on a Sunday?

1788
02:23:02,820 --> 02:23:05,880
I can't go if you have this stuff on a Sunday.

1789
02:23:05,880 --> 02:23:08,160
Have it on a Saturday, you suck.

1790
02:23:08,160 --> 02:23:11,960
And your town is dirty, and I know a lot of people live in San Francisco, it's like our

1791
02:23:11,960 --> 02:23:18,240
number one market in San Francisco, but you know what, the town is dirty.

1792
02:23:18,240 --> 02:23:24,240
I'm sure it's not you guys that listen to Orange Lawn's radio to make it dirty. It's the other million people living there. We can't pick up their trash.

1793
02:23:24,240 --> 02:23:26,240
It's gross. Frisco's a gross city.

1794
02:23:26,240 --> 02:23:28,240
Oh my god, do a million people really live in San Francisco?

1795
02:23:28,240 --> 02:23:32,240
I think it's actually 700,000, but I'm counting the surrounding area a little bit too.

1796
02:23:32,240 --> 02:23:34,240
That's why I'm glad I don't live there.

1797
02:23:34,240 --> 02:23:40,240
Alright, so, yeah. Screw you, San Francisco, and your stupid planning.

1798
02:23:40,240 --> 02:23:46,240
Alright, uh, rest of the room's turn. Let's start with Puppy.

1799
02:23:46,240 --> 02:23:53,240
Oh, I almost did not catch the mic.

1800
02:23:53,240 --> 02:23:58,240
Are we having like a porn DVD slideshow on the camera or something?

1801
02:23:58,240 --> 02:24:00,240
Ahem, eff you.

1802

Okay, um, fuck you to class starting because it's class and that's just the way it is.

02:25:41,200 --> 02:25:43,280

1823
02:25:59,960 --> 02:26:04,520
freely it's just like RTA all over again and I think I know I think it was one of

1824
02:26:04,520 --> 02:26:08,640
those fat teeny bop fat like high school teeny boppers I saw there on like Friday

1825
02:26:08,640 --> 02:26:16,200
afternoon so I'm not for sure oh no it wasn't broken trust me it wasn't but

1826
02:26:16,200 --> 02:26:20,200
Was it? I was there on Friday morning and you didn't care about it.

1827
02:26:20,200 --> 02:26:23,200
No, I was there before that, I think. Not ever.

1828
02:26:23,200 --> 02:26:26,200
But, um, let's see.

1829
02:26:26,200 --> 02:26:31,200
Fuck you goes to Workload English 57 for being exactly like high school.

1830
02:26:31,200 --> 02:26:37,200
I don't like group work, I don't like the teacher, and I hate it and I want to get out of there as fast as possible.

1831
02:26:37,200 --> 02:26:39,200
Um...

1832
02:26:39,200 --> 02:26:47,200
Fuck you goes to the, uh, stupid neighbors who live outside me who are always either laughing at music or trying to be ghetto thugs.

1833
02:26:48,200 --> 02:26:51,200
See yourselves for once. Come on now.

1834
02:26:51,200 --> 02:26:56,200
They aren't ghetto thugs. They're kinda actual ghetto thugs.

1835
02:26:56,200 --> 02:26:59,200
And...

1836
02:26:59,200 --> 02:27:03,200
I can't really think of any... much.

1837
02:27:03,200 --> 02:27:11,200
Oh yeah, and uh, fuck you to that stupid skillet that my parents gave me that doesn't actually work, it just happens to burn everything that you put in it.

1838
02:27:11,200 --> 02:27:16,200
Because it's metal and it's not cast iron. So yeah.

1839
02:27:16,200 --> 02:27:23,200
Alright, let's move on and see what our chat room has to say, shall we?

1840
02:27:23,200 --> 02:27:33,200
Brack2000 would like to say F you to overloaded the Lesson 2 song, not being a real DDR Max 2 song, and only a stupid Lesson Mode song.

1841
02:27:34,200 --> 02:27:36,200
Uh oh, VHD needs to respond to something in the chair.

1842
02:27:37,200 --> 02:27:48,200
Someone asked why I'm in workload English. It's because I got cocky on my subject A and I didn't put a thesis in my essay, so now I'm stuck there and I've ruined some of those cold idiots, basically, except for two people that I became friends with.

1843
02:27:48,200 --> 02:27:54,200
So yeah, that was an error on my part, but God, the teacher could be able to tell you that.

1844
02:28:18,200 --> 02:28:23,200
Fuck my QX949 for its bad mid-left front channel capacitator.

1845
02:28:23,200 --> 02:28:27,200
Capacitor, sorry. I read that wrong. Sorry.

1846
02:28:27,200 --> 02:28:31,200
Fuck my terrible C++ compiler.

1847
02:28:31,200 --> 02:28:39,200
Fuck the guy who sold me a wireless PS2 controller and just cut the cord off the regular controller.

1848
02:28:39,200 --> 02:28:42,200
That's great.

1849
02:28:42,200 --> 02:28:44,200
low-key was that you?

1850
02:28:44,200 --> 02:28:46,200
No.

1851
02:28:46,200 --> 02:28:48,200
I wouldn't have cut it out.

1852
02:28:48,200 --> 02:28:50,200
Biohazard also says,

1853
02:28:50,200 --> 02:28:52,200
Fuck my jellybean tin having a

1854
02:28:52,200 --> 02:28:54,200
finite supply on Jelly Bellies.

1855
02:28:54,200 --> 02:28:56,200
Fuck HAPP

1856
02:28:56,200 --> 02:28:58,200
controllers for wanting

1857
02:28:58,200 --> 02:29:00,200
$12.99 for a 2DX style button.

1858
02:29:00,200 --> 02:29:02,200
Fuck peeps who talk

1859
02:29:02,200 --> 02:29:04,200
like this. This is Asian writing.

1860
02:29:04,200 --> 02:29:06,200
I'm sorry, AZN writing.

1861
02:29:06,200 --> 02:29:08,200
And expect me to read it.

1862
02:29:08,200 --> 02:29:10,200
Fuck really negative people.

1863
02:29:10,200 --> 02:29:33,200
Just pay the money for the half-controls button, I bought like 16 of them, get over it!

1864
02:29:33,200 --> 02:29:37,200
H.K. Holly, Aaron would like to read this for you.

1865
02:29:37,200 --> 02:29:44,200
This is mostly an inside joke from Cali Bhimani, but fuck you green vaginal ooze.

1866
02:29:44,200 --> 02:29:50,200
Beautiful. Vaginal ooze is funny when it's green too.

1867
02:29:50,200 --> 02:29:52,200
Boy oh boy.

1868
02:29:52,200 --> 02:29:57,200
23rd Magus would like to say, F you to Angel's fucked up work schedule. She misses the show again.

1869
02:29:57,200 --> 02:30:02,200
F you to forgetting to wake my dad up in time to get a ride to the show. You missed food.

1870
02:30:02,200 --> 02:30:05,200
I am to suck. No comment.

1871
02:30:05,200 --> 02:30:11,200
F you to hatching a pouring egg, naming it, giving it a backpack, and then forgetting to feed it. 20k down the hole.

1872
02:30:11,200 --> 02:30:12,200
That's a Ragnarok reference.

1873
02:30:12,200 --> 02:30:24,200
And once again, fuck the lammers on Ragnarok Online. Please. Or PLZ. What's a PLZ? Oh, you want me to heal the monster you're fighting? Okay.

1874
02:30:24,200 --> 02:30:28,200
I have an F you. I don't know if you just said it because I was in the bathroom.

1875
02:30:28,200 --> 02:30:37,140
I hate you all and I hope that your computers explode and you all catch stars in the ass.

1876
02:30:37,140 --> 02:30:40,140
Thank you.

1877
02:30:40,140 --> 02:30:43,060
Chaos says F you to heartburn.

1878
02:30:43,060 --> 02:30:45,700
That's it.

1879
02:30:45,700 --> 02:30:46,700
Heartburn does suck.

1880
02:30:46,700 --> 02:30:48,660
I hate it.

1881
02:30:48,660 --> 02:30:52,700
No Stylin says my F you of the week is paying bills.

1882
02:30:52,700 --> 02:30:56,720
It's like you have bills and you pay them off and you have more of them and you wonder

1883
02:30:56,720 --> 02:30:57,820
where the hell they came from.

1884
02:30:57,820 --> 02:31:01,820
So I go, huh, you pay bills and more come. What's up with that?

1885
02:31:01,820 --> 02:31:05,760
I find how once you get money, it's gone in a second. So yeah, screw the government, screw

1886
02:31:05,760 --> 02:31:10,260
Dave and Gray Davis and this whole recall thing and screw expensive schools that try

1887
02:31:10,260 --> 02:31:15,940
to rip you off with name brand products which you don't have.

1888
02:31:15,940 --> 02:31:18,300
Screw you to the recall, the government and the recall?

1889
02:31:18,300 --> 02:31:19,300
Yes.

1890
02:31:19,300 --> 02:31:20,740
One or the other?

1891
02:31:20,740 --> 02:31:23,740
Screw you to anything involving the recall. Just go away.

1892
02:31:23,740 --> 02:31:24,740
Okay.

1893
02:31:24,740 --> 02:31:25,740
It involves him.

1894
02:31:25,740 --> 02:31:33,740
Tal would like to say Final Fantasy Tactics Advance because I don't actually own the game, or the Game Boy Advance, so I have to borrow both.

1895
02:31:33,740 --> 02:31:39,740
You mooch-er, you mooch-er, you have my DDR Max, and you have someone else's tactics in Game Boy. Mooch!

1896
02:31:39,740 --> 02:31:46,740
And you have Jamie's Parappa. Mooch! It's Moochie the Mooch-er here on OnSoft Radio.

1897
02:31:46,740 --> 02:31:49,740
Mooch. Mooch.

1898
02:31:49,740 --> 02:31:50,740
Okay.

1899
02:31:50,740 --> 02:31:52,740
He's in Davis, that's where you're supposed to mooch from.

1900
02:31:52,740 --> 02:31:59,040
I'd also like to say F U to Initial D, because the music and the animation style sucks, and

1901
02:31:59,040 --> 02:32:05,040
the story is straight out of a bad samurai movie. And F U to my DVD drive for dying.

1902
02:32:05,040 --> 02:32:13,400
All right, that's it. That's all the FUs of the week. Thank you for playing.

1903
02:32:13,400 --> 02:32:21,800
Okay, so I think we'll take another break. We exhausted all our new MP, oh, we exhausted

1904
02:32:21,800 --> 02:32:29,600
all our new Max MP3s, so why don't we go back and visit Max USA 1? We'll go back and visit

1905
02:32:29,600 --> 02:32:31,800
that. We're going to play some songs from Max 1 USA.

1906
02:32:31,800 --> 02:32:38,640
I'm going to get stabbed with a pitchfork. What am I getting stabbed with if I play Samstorm

1907
02:32:38,640 --> 02:32:45,440
Chopsticks? Well, we're going to start this break off with Samstorm, and after that we'll

1908
02:32:45,440 --> 02:32:47,200
hear some other things from Max USA.

1909
02:32:47,200 --> 02:32:49,400
I have a comment.

1910
02:32:49,400 --> 02:32:50,400
Thoughtters die.

1911
02:32:50,400 --> 02:32:51,400
Thank you.

1912
02:32:51,400 --> 02:32:52,400
Thank you for sharing.

1913
02:32:52,400 --> 02:32:54,400
Sign up for my message board.

1914
02:32:54,400 --> 02:32:55,400
All right.

1915
02:32:55,400 --> 02:32:59,520
We'll be back after this break and what do you guys think?

1916
02:32:59,520 --> 02:33:02,400
How about Ask Orange Lounge when we come out?

1917
02:33:02,400 --> 02:33:03,400
Sure.

1918
02:33:03,400 --> 02:33:04,400
All right.

1919
02:33:04,400 --> 02:33:09,360
The chat room has some questions so send your questions now for Ask Orange Lounge and for

1920
02:33:09,360 --> 02:33:13,240
the 5,000th time we'll play Overloaded after the show.

1921
02:33:13,240 --> 02:33:14,840
We've already played it tonight during the show.

1922
02:33:14,840 --> 02:33:18,080
Yeah, I'm going to overload you in a minute.

1923
02:33:18,080 --> 02:33:19,080
All right.

1924
02:33:19,080 --> 02:33:26,080
We'll be back.

1925
02:34:49,080 --> 02:34:59,080
Yeah, drop the bar, just drop the bar, yeah, drop the bar

1926
02:34:59,080 --> 02:35:01,080
Let's get to the top

1927
02:35:01,080 --> 02:35:03,080
Yeah, if you get down to the top of the line, it's just a dollar

1928
02:35:03,080 --> 02:35:05,080
There is a top of the line, you're flashing long ways

1929
02:35:05,080 --> 02:35:07,080
You're a different person, but I can't hide the institution today

1930
02:35:07,080 --> 02:35:09,080
Don't get me wrong, I'm a pastor

1931
02:35:09,080 --> 02:35:11,080
The mind map is more than this

1932
02:35:11,080 --> 02:35:13,080
Well, concern on what it takes to deserve it's all we need

1933
02:35:13,080 --> 02:35:15,080
Hey, boy, you gotta lose your momentum

1934
02:35:15,080 --> 02:35:17,080
If you need to write those events

1935
02:35:17,080 --> 02:35:19,080
Ride the waves, time's counting, the rhythm's a market

1936
02:35:19,080 --> 02:35:21,080
If we can't get wind of the maintenance center

1937
02:35:21,080 --> 02:35:23,080
It all might be hard for you to do it now, you got to hang those solids

1938
02:35:23,080 --> 02:35:25,080
Yeah, so ready to take that ball

1939
02:35:25,080 --> 02:35:27,080
You can make it all the way from the ball

1940
02:35:29,080 --> 02:35:31,080
Yeah, yeah, drop the ball

1941
02:35:33,080 --> 02:35:35,080
Drop the ball

1942
02:35:35,080 --> 02:35:37,080
Let's just keep that ball

1943
02:35:41,080 --> 02:35:43,080
If we can't just build more rhythm

1944
02:35:43,080 --> 02:35:45,080
If we need the right tools and sensors

1945
02:35:45,080 --> 02:35:47,080
I'm counting the rhythm, the march to the system

1946
02:35:47,080 --> 02:35:49,080
Don't get with it, I'm saying you're staring all by the heart

1947
02:35:49,080 --> 02:35:51,080
You can do it now, you're looking back, don't fall

1948
02:35:51,080 --> 02:35:54,080
Yeah, it's a race to take that fall, and it's up to you to hit that goal

1949
02:35:57,080 --> 02:35:58,080
You can drop that ball

1950
02:36:00,080 --> 02:36:01,080
You can drop that ball

1951
02:36:03,080 --> 02:36:04,080
You can drop that ball

1952
02:36:34,080 --> 02:36:37,580
Leave me alone, don't tell me why

1953
02:36:37,580 --> 02:36:41,080
There is nothing to carry on

1954
02:36:41,080 --> 02:36:46,580
Leave me alone, it's not right

1955
02:36:46,580 --> 02:36:48,080
And why

1956
02:36:48,080 --> 02:36:51,580
Leave me alone, so many days

1957
02:36:51,580 --> 02:36:55,080
Just thinking of you so many nights

1958
02:36:55,080 --> 02:37:00,080
Leave me alone, it's not right

1959
02:37:00,080 --> 02:37:02,080
Now tell me why

1960
02:37:07,080 --> 02:37:09,080
Now tell me why

1961
02:37:39,080 --> 02:38:05,200
Alright, welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 62 in progress.

1962
02:38:05,200 --> 02:38:07,680
As promised, we're going to do Ask Orange Lounge,

1963
02:38:07,680 --> 02:38:11,240
so send your questions to us now in the chat room.

1964
02:38:11,240 --> 02:38:14,040
Anybody have any quick thoughts, any other Bimani-related things

1965
02:38:14,040 --> 02:38:16,520
they want to talk about before we get into Ask Orange Lounge?

1966
02:38:16,520 --> 02:38:17,020
What now?

1967
02:38:17,020 --> 02:38:17,520
No, no, no.

1968
02:38:17,520 --> 02:38:18,680
What?

1969
02:38:18,680 --> 02:38:20,080
Any interesting Bimani stories?

1970
02:38:20,080 --> 02:38:21,680
I have a question to ask the chat room.

1971
02:38:21,680 --> 02:38:22,400
What's that?

1972
02:38:22,400 --> 02:38:23,520
Is it safe?

1973
02:38:23,520 --> 02:38:25,320
Is it safe?

1974
02:38:25,320 --> 02:38:27,000
Oh, you have to send your message or you

1975
02:38:27,000 --> 02:38:28,640
have to send your questions over private message

1976
02:38:28,640 --> 02:38:29,760
or they aren't counted.

1977
02:38:29,760 --> 02:38:32,520
Also, real fast, just to plug some of our other programming

1978
02:38:32,520 --> 02:38:34,840
on Orange Lounge Radio, bringing you live programming

1979
02:38:34,840 --> 02:38:36,080
more throughout the week.

1980
02:38:36,080 --> 02:38:41,160
Tomorrow night is Vanilla Sky, featuring myself and my cohorts

1981
02:38:41,160 --> 02:38:43,840
in Crime, Rice Princess, and Lanky Style.

1982
02:38:43,840 --> 02:38:46,720
And we just sit around, and we talk about other video games.

1983
02:38:46,720 --> 02:38:49,840
And we kind of talk about other weird stuff, too.

1984
02:38:49,840 --> 02:38:51,400
We'll talk about what's in the news,

1985
02:38:51,400 --> 02:38:53,880
and how it relates to our world, and things that piss us off.

1986
02:38:53,880 --> 02:38:55,040
Oh my god, you read the news.

1987
02:38:55,040 --> 02:38:57,120
And Yahoo, yes, we read the news to our listeners,

1988
02:38:57,120 --> 02:38:59,480
because they aren't going to get it any other way.

1989
02:38:59,480 --> 02:39:02,120
We make fun of Yahoo, and we do video game

1990
02:39:02,120 --> 02:39:05,560
trivia to bad music, and all sorts of fun things like that.

1991
02:39:05,560 --> 02:39:08,320
So tune in at 7 o'clock Monday night, Pacific time.

1992
02:39:08,320 --> 02:39:16,440
On Tuesday nights, excuse me, that was a peanut burp.

1993
02:39:16,440 --> 02:39:21,960
Anyway, Tuesday night is pump up the volume where I play your

1994
02:39:21,960 --> 02:39:23,760
requests from our chat room.

1995
02:39:23,760 --> 02:39:26,840
Except the thing is, nobody requests anything, god damn it.

1996
02:39:26,840 --> 02:39:28,560
That's OK, more songs you get to play for yourself.

1997
02:39:28,560 --> 02:39:33,800
So you could do, I'll basically partake in my really weird taste in music.

1998
02:39:33,940 --> 02:39:38,780
I could do a show called Ice Cream for five minutes.

1999
02:39:40,000 --> 02:39:44,260
This weekend on Orange Lounge Radio on Thursday,

2000
02:39:44,260 --> 02:39:51,600
I will do a show called Ice Cream, it's a reference to the webcam.

2001
02:39:51,600 --> 02:39:59,980
Anyways, I should do a show called Ice Cream for Five Minutes, in which I will scream for

2002
02:39:59,980 --> 02:40:00,980
five minutes.

2003
02:40:00,980 --> 02:40:01,980
Ice cream?

2004
02:40:01,980 --> 02:40:02,980
You're going to give out ice cream for five minutes?

2005
02:40:02,980 --> 02:40:03,980
Oh my God, I can't hear you.

2006
02:40:03,980 --> 02:40:04,980
No, here, okay.

2007
02:40:04,980 --> 02:40:05,980
Here, hold on.

2008
02:40:05,980 --> 02:40:09,500
Before you do this, this is actually Orsage Radio related.

2009
02:40:09,500 --> 02:40:14,140
I'm thinking, I may do, okay, we're going to, one of two things is going to happen.

2010
02:40:14,140 --> 02:40:18,300
Either Live Water is going to come back, or a new show.

2011
02:40:18,300 --> 02:40:19,300
What's that?

2012
02:40:19,300 --> 02:40:20,300
Involving basketball.

2013
02:40:20,300 --> 02:40:21,300
No, no!

2014
02:40:21,300 --> 02:40:28,060
Seriously, a new show, seriously, what are you talking about, I can't get the mic any

2015
02:40:28,060 --> 02:40:34,100
closer, what are you talking about, they're away, oh okay, anyways, so the new show, it's

2016
02:40:34,100 --> 02:40:42,620
gonna be a game show, oh a game show, my favorite, a new, uh yeah, as long as there's nothing

2017
02:40:42,620 --> 02:40:52,140
the box okay you can have the box anyways new game show possibly if I

2018
02:40:52,140 --> 02:40:57,420
decide I don't want to live wire anymore it will be there will actually be

2019
02:40:57,420 --> 02:41:02,060
prizes serious like no prizes given away so and what kind of game show will this

2020
02:41:02,060 --> 02:41:06,460
be do we know yet I don't know okay something crazy very crazy I was gonna

2021
02:41:06,460 --> 02:41:14,660
to call it like attention porn. Why are the girls yelling for porn? Like it was either

2022
02:41:14,660 --> 02:41:20,740
going to be called like something like porn. Shut up! Like the ten second attention span

2023
02:41:20,740 --> 02:41:32,140
show or something like that. Alright. I'll be fine. Okay fine. Porn. Back to my show

2024
02:41:32,140 --> 02:41:39,520
show, which I instilled. It starts at 7 o'clock, because the pre-show at 730, the show begins

2025
02:41:39,520 --> 02:41:44,400
to 1030. And basically, I just play a bunch of crap. And I've been saying that I'm going

2026
02:41:44,400 --> 02:41:53,240
to do video game music trivia, but I don't know. People send me songs. I'll have my IRC

2027
02:41:53,240 --> 02:42:01,080
open. My name is DarkSakuraSSF. So start sending me video game music if you want to play. If

2028
02:42:01,080 --> 02:42:06,140
not been near a big stinky poopy head. Fair enough. And that's the bottom line because

2029
02:42:06,140 --> 02:42:16,320
Dark Sakura said so. Okay. Go online! Wednesday nights are open. I was following the example

2030
02:42:16,320 --> 02:42:22,140
of our, you know, Beymani influence system SF. Wednesday nights are open right now. We

2031
02:42:22,140 --> 02:42:27,780
do a bit of randomness on Wednesdays. This week I've been asked to do Orange Lounge Presents

2032
02:42:27,780 --> 02:42:33,540
Trivial Pursuit on Wednesday, which we might do. I don't know yet. I know there's enough

2033
02:42:33,540 --> 02:42:38,780
interest from the regulars on all the shows to do it. Okay.

2034
02:42:38,780 --> 02:42:41,280
If I was playing that, we'd have to break out the Janus edition.

2035
02:42:41,280 --> 02:42:46,080
So I'm thinking we're going to do Trivial Pursuit on Wednesday, but stay tuned to our

2036
02:42:46,080 --> 02:42:49,700
chat room for details. So drop in our chat room sometime during the week and we'll have

2037
02:42:49,700 --> 02:42:51,020
a Trivial Pursuit this Wednesday.

2038
02:42:51,020 --> 02:42:52,820
If you're not in the chat room, you're not cool.

2039
02:42:52,820 --> 02:42:57,300
Yeah, if you're not in our chat room 24 hours a day, you're not cool.

2040
02:42:57,300 --> 02:42:59,300
I visit like maybe once a week.

2041
02:42:59,300 --> 02:43:05,300
Well, if you're not there 24 hours a day you're not cool, but if you're there 24 hour days

2042
02:43:05,300 --> 02:43:07,740
you don't have a life.

2043
02:43:07,740 --> 02:43:08,740
And then you're not cool.

2044
02:43:08,740 --> 02:43:09,740
You're screwed.

2045
02:43:09,740 --> 02:43:10,740
You're screwed.

2046
02:43:10,740 --> 02:43:11,740
What a fun thought.

2047
02:43:11,740 --> 02:43:12,740
Either way, you're a loser.

2048
02:43:12,740 --> 02:43:13,740
All right.

2049
02:43:13,740 --> 02:43:20,260
Thursday night Snowboard Lounge Radio is hiatus right now.

2050
02:43:20,260 --> 02:43:22,940
We might be doing some repeats of Live Wire.

2051
02:43:22,940 --> 02:43:25,500
If I get brave, I might do a new mix, so we'll see.

2052
02:43:25,500 --> 02:43:28,500
There might be another potential...

2053
02:43:28,500 --> 02:43:31,840
I did one Megamix, it played after Vanilla Sky one week.

2054
02:43:31,840 --> 02:43:33,980
There might be another potential goodie, though.

2055
02:43:33,980 --> 02:43:35,820
Hmm, a goodie.

2056
02:43:35,820 --> 02:43:39,660
Ah, yes, we have another show that may be coming up on soon, so...

2057
02:43:39,660 --> 02:43:40,660
Maybe not this Thursday, but soon.

2058
02:43:40,660 --> 02:43:46,100
Which, you know, I think that we need to introduce one of our newer listeners as another foreign

2059
02:43:46,100 --> 02:43:47,780
correspondent.

2060
02:43:47,780 --> 02:43:49,940
Even though he probably can't make it up here.

2061
02:43:49,940 --> 02:43:50,940
Don't!

2062
02:43:50,940 --> 02:43:51,940
He's probably not listening.

2063
02:43:51,940 --> 02:43:52,940
Is he listening?

2064
02:43:52,940 --> 02:43:53,940
I don't think he's listening, he's not in the chat room.

2065
02:43:53,940 --> 02:43:54,940
Well, poop.

2066
02:43:54,940 --> 02:43:57,940
Make sure he's here next week and we'll give him a proper introduction.

2067
02:43:57,940 --> 02:43:59,940
We'll give him a proper introduction next week if he shows up.

2068
02:43:59,940 --> 02:44:01,940
In the meantime, we've only got 20 minutes left of show,

2069
02:44:01,940 --> 02:44:03,940
or actually no, 25 because we started late tonight,

2070
02:44:03,940 --> 02:44:06,940
but we have plenty of questions that have already been submitted.

2071
02:44:06,940 --> 02:44:07,940
It's not too late.

2072
02:44:07,940 --> 02:44:12,940
If you want to join in, go into www.calibomani.com,

2073
02:44:12,940 --> 02:44:17,940
click on Orange Lounge, and click on Chat,

2074
02:44:17,940 --> 02:44:21,940
and you can submit a question for Ask Orange Lounge.

2075
02:44:21,940 --> 02:44:28,040
We have to listen to Rob sing.

2076
02:44:28,040 --> 02:44:30,940
Let's ask Orange Lounge some stupid questions.

2077
02:44:30,940 --> 02:44:34,400
Rob's going to sing all week this week on Orange Lounge's video.

2078
02:44:34,400 --> 02:44:35,400
Oh my God, they need to fight.

2079
02:44:35,400 --> 02:44:38,120
Jamie needs to stop playing with a fucking ferret.

2080
02:44:38,120 --> 02:44:39,120
I'm not playing with a ferret.

2081
02:44:39,120 --> 02:44:43,360
Or I'm going to get lucky to shove up her ass.

2082
02:44:43,360 --> 02:44:44,360
Rob?

2083
02:44:44,360 --> 02:44:45,360
Rob?

2084
02:44:45,360 --> 02:44:46,360
Rob?

2085
02:44:46,360 --> 02:44:47,360
What?

2086
02:44:47,360 --> 02:44:48,360
Rob?

2087
02:44:48,360 --> 02:44:49,360
What?

2088
02:44:49,360 --> 02:44:50,360
Rob?

2089
02:44:50,360 --> 02:44:51,360
What?

2090
02:44:51,360 --> 02:44:52,360
What?

2091
02:44:52,360 --> 02:44:53,360
What?

2092
02:44:53,360 --> 02:44:54,360
Rob?

2093
02:44:54,360 --> 02:44:55,360
What?

2094
02:44:55,360 --> 02:44:56,360
Nothing.

2095
02:44:56,360 --> 02:44:57,360
Alright.

2096
02:44:57,360 --> 02:44:58,360
Rob!

2097
02:44:58,360 --> 02:44:59,360
Biohazard has about seven questions.

2098
02:44:59,360 --> 02:45:00,360
Rob!

2099
02:45:00,360 --> 02:45:01,360
Rob!

2100
02:45:01,360 --> 02:45:02,360
Rob!

2101
02:45:02,360 --> 02:45:03,360
Shut up!

2102
02:45:03,360 --> 02:45:04,360
Rob!

2103
02:45:04,360 --> 02:45:05,360
Biohazard has about seven questions to ask tonight.

2104
02:45:05,360 --> 02:45:06,360
Rob!

2105
02:45:06,360 --> 02:45:07,360
Shut the fuck up!

2106
02:45:07,360 --> 02:45:08,360
Rob!

2107
02:45:08,360 --> 02:45:09,360
Alright.

2108
02:45:09,360 --> 02:45:11,360
Has about seven questions to ask.

2109
02:45:11,360 --> 02:45:12,360
Rob!

2110
02:45:12,360 --> 02:45:13,360
What?

2111
02:45:13,360 --> 02:45:14,360
Hi.

2112
02:45:14,360 --> 02:45:18,440
He's turning red in the face.

2113
02:45:18,440 --> 02:45:20,920
I'm starting off with questions from Biohazard.

2114
02:45:20,920 --> 02:45:30,920
Why doesn't Jimmy crack carrots or potatoes or something? Corn is so boring.

2115
02:45:30,920 --> 02:45:33,920
Why doesn't Jimmy just do crack?

2116
02:45:33,920 --> 02:45:36,920
Good, I like that.

2117
02:45:36,920 --> 02:45:43,920
Biohazard also wants to know how long will I have to wait for Overloaded to be available on Bimani style or acquire it some other way?

2118
02:45:43,920 --> 02:45:45,920
Excuse me, are we Bimani style?

2119
02:45:45,920 --> 02:45:46,920
Yeah, are we Bimani style?

2120
02:45:46,920 --> 02:45:53,920
I already have it, but I just played it on the show.

2121
02:45:53,920 --> 02:45:59,320
We're not the Mani style, go ask them.

2122
02:45:59,320 --> 02:46:03,000
If you were a member of our Orange Lounge Radio Live Journal community, you would have

2123
02:46:03,000 --> 02:46:05,040
already gotten a link to that file.

2124
02:46:05,040 --> 02:46:08,200
Oh, that's right, Loki posted it earlier this week, didn't he?

2125
02:46:08,200 --> 02:46:09,200
So you saw it.

2126
02:46:09,200 --> 02:46:10,200
Alright.

2127
02:46:10,200 --> 02:46:11,200
Alright.

2128
02:46:11,200 --> 02:46:12,200
Who cares about the step file?

2129
02:46:12,200 --> 02:46:13,200
Orange Lounge.

2130
02:46:13,200 --> 02:46:14,200
Make your own damn step file.

2131
02:46:14,200 --> 02:46:15,200
Community.

2132
02:46:15,200 --> 02:46:16,200
Oh yeah, and why?

2133
02:46:16,200 --> 02:46:19,040
And why he cracks corn is so you don't care.

2134
02:46:19,040 --> 02:46:20,880
Because it's so boring, you don't care.

2135
02:46:20,880 --> 02:46:21,880
Oh, go back to that.

2136
02:46:21,880 --> 02:46:24,880
Sorry, we missed you on the first one, Riley.

2137
02:46:24,880 --> 02:46:29,280
People got a lot of free time if they're coming up with questions like, why does Jimmy crack

2138
02:46:29,280 --> 02:46:30,920
corn and not potatoes?

2139
02:46:30,920 --> 02:46:33,080
You can't crack potatoes anyway.

2140
02:46:33,080 --> 02:46:35,720
I'll read one more from Biohazard, then I'm going to somebody else, and we'll come back

2141
02:46:35,720 --> 02:46:37,040
to the rest of those questions.

2142
02:46:37,040 --> 02:46:42,080
Biohazard wants to know, how would I write a script for SysReset to display a random

2143
02:46:42,080 --> 02:46:49,920
line from a txt file every time exclamation bad joke is pulled do what is that like like

2144
02:46:49,920 --> 02:46:54,360
a chatbot some nerdy chatbot thing yeah well you're not in our chat room because we don't

2145
02:46:54,360 --> 02:47:06,660

2146
02:47:06,660 --> 02:47:11,640
again don't use the chatbot we will kick you if you do biohazard also wants to know because

2147
02:47:11,640 --> 02:47:15,200
Aaron really wants to answer this, so I'll do one more. Why get mad when you can get

2148
02:47:15,200 --> 02:47:21,120
glad? Well, you know, I don't really know, but what I say is why get mad when you can

2149
02:47:21,120 --> 02:47:28,120
just use that energy and put it into sex? Why get mad? Get horny! Don't get mad, get

2150
02:47:28,600 --> 02:47:35,600
violent. Violent and horny. Oh, it's violent horny girl here on Orange Lounge Radio, VHG.

2151
02:47:35,600 --> 02:47:49,040
VHG special guest violent horny girl I like it all right damn it I'm not

How about velvet, horny gangbang?

2155
02:48:02,900 --> 02:48:03,900
Violence is more fun.

2156
02:48:03,900 --> 02:48:04,900
All right.

2157
02:48:04,900 --> 02:48:07,100
Twenty-third maggots would like to know, how's the food-

2158
02:48:07,100 --> 02:48:09,100
Ah, who cares?

2159
02:48:09,100 --> 02:48:11,100
Be nice.

2160
02:48:11,100 --> 02:48:12,740
How's the food over there?

2161
02:48:12,740 --> 02:48:14,620
Because we all ate tonight.

2162
02:48:14,620 --> 02:48:16,060
Well, no one's dead yet.

2163
02:48:16,060 --> 02:48:17,060
And the food's gone.

2164
02:48:17,060 --> 02:48:18,060
The food was good.

2165
02:48:18,060 --> 02:48:19,060
Thank you.

2166
02:48:19,060 --> 02:48:20,060
Sorry, hairball.

2167
02:48:20,060 --> 02:48:27,860
Well, the food's gone, so it was eaten.

2168
02:48:27,860 --> 02:48:33,740
best. It was at least tolerable if it's all gone.

2169
02:48:33,740 --> 02:48:35,100
And Jamie makes a sad face.

2170
02:48:35,100 --> 02:48:39,020
The eel was interesting. I've never really had eel in that mass quantity before. It was

2171
02:48:39,020 --> 02:48:42,020
interesting. I don't know if I necessarily like the flavor, but it was good.

2172
02:48:42,020 --> 02:48:45,380
I didn't even notice really that it was eel, because I ate it with chicken, too.

2173
02:48:45,380 --> 02:48:50,060
Yeah, see, I had just straight-up eel. It was a little weird for me, but it was good.

2174
02:48:50,060 --> 02:48:51,060
Oh.

2175
02:48:51,060 --> 02:48:56,500
Oh, well, maybe that's why. It was good, though, and I appreciate Jamie's effort to cook for

2176
02:48:56,500 --> 02:49:03,140
us because you know we're single and don't cook at least i don't anyway damn it i'm gonna

2177
02:49:03,140 --> 02:49:09,700
make sure you guys have proper nutrition okay you're eating instant rice and like super

2178
02:49:09,700 --> 02:49:17,580
bacon you are going to i haven't had super bacon in two weeks actually i've seen what's

2179
02:49:17,580 --> 02:49:21,700
in your fridge and there's hardly anything in there when you guys live off of pop tarts

2180
02:49:21,700 --> 02:49:30,860
Okay, Rob. For one week I challenge you. You need to eat the same things that I do for

2181
02:49:30,860 --> 02:49:31,860
a week.

2182
02:49:31,860 --> 02:49:32,860
Oh, give me a break.

2183
02:49:32,860 --> 02:49:38,100
What I eat is very, very easy. Very easy. You have to have a bowl of oatmeal in the

2184
02:49:38,100 --> 02:49:39,100
morning.

2185
02:49:39,100 --> 02:49:40,100
Ew.

2186
02:49:40,100 --> 02:49:41,100
Okay.

2187
02:49:41,100 --> 02:49:42,100
Let me lick mud.

2188
02:49:42,100 --> 02:49:43,100
Okay.

2189
02:49:43,100 --> 02:49:47,620
Look, he said, let me lick mud.

2190
02:49:47,620 --> 02:49:55,900
The brown sugar and maple instant oatmeal is really good, and Yoplait yogurt is really

2191
02:49:55,900 --> 02:49:56,900
good.

2192
02:49:56,900 --> 02:49:57,900
Oatmeal is for old people.

2193
02:49:57,900 --> 02:50:00,420
Oatmeal is for people who like to shit.

2194
02:50:00,420 --> 02:50:01,420
Wait.

2195
02:50:01,420 --> 02:50:02,420
Wait.

2196
02:50:02,420 --> 02:50:03,420
You like to shit?

2197
02:50:03,420 --> 02:50:04,420
No.

2198
02:50:04,420 --> 02:50:05,420
It's TMI radio.

2199
02:50:05,420 --> 02:50:06,420
No.

2200
02:50:06,420 --> 02:50:10,900
That's why old people eat it, but it's good for like your...

2201
02:50:10,900 --> 02:50:12,900
It's fiber.

2202
02:50:12,900 --> 02:50:16,540
Fiber is good for you.

2203
02:50:16,540 --> 02:50:23,780
And then for lunch, you need to have a microwave dinner, because they're really good.

2204
02:50:23,780 --> 02:50:26,140
And veggie burgers for dinner every night.

2205
02:50:26,140 --> 02:50:27,140
Yeah.

2206
02:50:27,140 --> 02:50:28,140
They're good.

2207
02:50:28,140 --> 02:50:29,140
A veggie cheeseburger.

2208
02:50:29,140 --> 02:50:32,140
I usually have veggie burgers for lunch.

2209
02:50:32,140 --> 02:50:33,660
Okay, that's good.

2210
02:50:33,660 --> 02:50:35,860
But see, one week.

2211
02:50:35,860 --> 02:50:36,860
One week.

2212
02:50:36,860 --> 02:50:37,860
No Pop-Tarts.

2213
02:50:37,860 --> 02:50:40,740
Actually, I don't eat Pop-Tarts, actually.

2214
02:50:40,740 --> 02:50:41,740
I don't like Pop-Tarts.

2215
02:50:41,740 --> 02:50:45,300
I usually have either a Nutri-Grain bar in the morning, or I won't eat breakfast when

2216
02:50:45,300 --> 02:50:47,580
I get to work on a bag of pretzels.

2217
02:50:47,580 --> 02:50:49,420
That's not good for you.

2218
02:50:49,420 --> 02:50:51,020
I try nutrient bars, though.

2219
02:50:51,020 --> 02:50:53,020
That's usually what I eat.

2220
02:50:53,020 --> 02:50:54,380
Eat people, OK?

2221
02:50:54,380 --> 02:50:55,620
Eat people.

2222
02:50:55,620 --> 02:50:59,060
And next week, I am bringing stir fry.

2223
02:50:59,060 --> 02:51:01,340
Or we will cook stir fry.

2224
02:51:01,340 --> 02:51:03,860
I have my super hot chocolate when I get to work.

2225
02:51:03,860 --> 02:51:06,740
It's three bags of hot chocolate concentrated.

2226
02:51:06,740 --> 02:51:08,860
And then I put a little bit of hot water in there,

2227
02:51:08,860 --> 02:51:11,460
so it's super frothy.

2228
02:51:11,460 --> 02:51:12,340
That's all I eat.

2229
02:51:12,340 --> 02:51:14,340
Everything is super with you.

2230
02:51:14,340 --> 02:51:21,020
The thing I used to have when I worked at this stupid temp agency that no longer exists

2231
02:51:21,020 --> 02:51:27,180
in my universe, I would have half a cup of super strong coffee and then pour the rest

2232
02:51:27,180 --> 02:51:32,100
of it in hot chocolate and then throw in like five packs of sugar and that was what I would

2233
02:51:32,100 --> 02:51:33,100
drink every morning.

2234
02:51:33,100 --> 02:51:34,100
That's healthy.

2235
02:51:34,100 --> 02:51:35,500
See, I don't drink that crap anymore.

2236
02:51:35,500 --> 02:51:42,260
I've been off of my soda now for a week, so I'm happy.

2237
02:51:42,260 --> 02:51:48,260
23rd Magus would like to also know, Sky, that's me, could you give me my jokes back please?

2238
02:51:48,260 --> 02:51:49,260
No.

2239
02:51:49,260 --> 02:51:50,260
What, all three of them?

2240
02:51:50,260 --> 02:51:52,260
Yeah, you wish you could be as cool as me.

2241
02:51:52,260 --> 02:51:54,260
You want to drop from five last week?

2242
02:51:54,260 --> 02:51:56,260
Yeah, he has negative jokes now.

2243
02:51:56,260 --> 02:51:58,260
Campbell Soup, one of our new chatters.

2244
02:51:58,260 --> 02:52:01,260
Unless it's somebody who changed our name, I don't think so.

2245
02:52:01,260 --> 02:52:05,260
Campbell Soup would like to know, what's up with the foam on beer?

2246
02:52:05,260 --> 02:52:06,260
Good question.

2247
02:52:06,260 --> 02:52:08,260
It's what makes you fart.

2248
02:52:08,260 --> 02:52:09,260
Hey, give me that.

2249
02:52:09,260 --> 02:52:17,460
Why is beer better than women?

2250
02:52:17,460 --> 02:52:18,460
Why?

2251
02:52:18,460 --> 02:52:27,940
Because no matter how you pour it, you always have good head.

2252
02:52:27,940 --> 02:52:32,900
I could have magism.

2253
02:52:32,900 --> 02:52:36,180
He doesn't tell R-rated jokes though.

2254
02:52:36,180 --> 02:52:37,660
Why is there foam on beer?

2255
02:52:37,660 --> 02:52:43,360
It's just the way God made it, but all I have to say is don't drink beer, drink Guinness.

2256
02:52:43,360 --> 02:52:46,260
Beer tastes like pee smells.

2257
02:52:46,260 --> 02:52:50,100
Foam is there to remind you that you're wasting your time and if you want to get fucked up,

2258
02:52:50,100 --> 02:52:51,140
just drink some hard liquor.

2259
02:52:51,140 --> 02:52:56,340
Go straight for the 151 or the Schlager or Everclear.

2260
02:52:56,340 --> 02:52:58,980
Alcohol recipe of the week, apple pie.

2261
02:52:58,980 --> 02:53:02,580
The foam is there to remind you that you're a pussy, you're drinking beer.

2262
02:53:02,580 --> 02:53:08,700
You get a big glass gallon jug of apple juice and then you pour it all out in another container

2263
02:53:08,700 --> 02:53:13,680
and then you pour in about half a bottle of Everclear and let cinnamon sticks dissolve

2264
02:53:13,680 --> 02:53:18,520
in it and then you pour in the apple juice and let it sit for like a couple days and

2265
02:53:18,520 --> 02:53:21,380
you have apple pie.

2266
02:53:21,380 --> 02:53:25,680
23rd Magus says beer goes down easy and I'd like to know is that the beer or the beer

2267
02:53:25,680 --> 02:53:28,680
bottle in your case?

2268
02:53:28,680 --> 02:53:35,680
Here is Nasty.

2269
02:53:35,680 --> 02:53:49,240
How did the ferret get into the show?

2270
02:53:49,240 --> 02:53:51,280
Ferret's been here since day one.

2271
02:53:51,280 --> 02:53:57,960
Yeah, we've been throwing it around and having the ferrets rape each other and mad ferret

2272
02:53:57,960 --> 02:53:58,960
sex.

2273
02:53:58,960 --> 02:54:04,880
Actually, ferret number one was a birthday gift to me from my old stalker.

2274
02:54:04,880 --> 02:54:08,700
And I just, I have all these stuffed animals, can you shut the goddamn thing up for one

2275
02:54:08,700 --> 02:54:09,700
minute while I tell the story?

2276
02:54:09,700 --> 02:54:11,800
It's the ferret story, he's always contributing.

2277
02:54:11,800 --> 02:54:16,400
We used to have, or I still do, I have all my stuffed animals on top of the computer,

2278
02:54:16,400 --> 02:54:19,760
like I know you can't really see it on the webcam, but there's all these stuffed animals

2279
02:54:19,760 --> 02:54:23,080
that sit on top of the computer like Cartman, oh Bradley is turning the thing over so you

2280
02:54:23,080 --> 02:54:24,080
can see the stuffed animals.

2281
02:54:24,080 --> 02:54:28,680
We have like Cartman and Pikachu and like a little stuffed devil, my happy birthday

2282
02:54:28,680 --> 02:54:30,880
bear that Jamie got me and all this stuff here.

2283
02:54:30,880 --> 02:54:35,180
Oh it just went up to the camp so there you go you guys can look.

2284
02:54:35,180 --> 02:54:38,700
And the ferret used to sit there and one day Jamie pulled it down and started pushing the

2285
02:54:38,700 --> 02:54:44,440
button and learned that it made noises and behold the show got worse.

2286
02:54:44,440 --> 02:54:48,160
And then Loki found the second ferret at some random store and he brought it over to some

2287
02:54:48,160 --> 02:54:49,160
show a while back.

2288
02:54:49,160 --> 02:54:54,160
They sell them at Walgreens so everyone can have a ferret of their own.

2289
02:54:54,160 --> 02:54:55,160
H.K.

2290
02:54:55,160 --> 02:55:06,920
Holley would like to know, can vegetarians eat animal crackers?

2291
02:55:06,920 --> 02:55:10,560
If the lingos are not made out of animal parts.

2292
02:55:10,560 --> 02:55:15,000
That's an interesting question.

2293
02:55:15,000 --> 02:55:16,560
I would say yes, it's okay.

2294
02:55:16,560 --> 02:55:20,900
I think I know some vegetarians who do eat animal crackers, especially, you know what's

2295
02:55:20,900 --> 02:55:24,560
good with those animal crackers with the frosting on them and the little balls, the mother's

2296
02:55:24,560 --> 02:55:25,560
crackers?

2297
02:55:25,560 --> 02:55:26,560
You know what I'm talking about?

2298
02:55:26,560 --> 02:55:27,560
Oh, yes, the mother's cookies.

2299
02:55:27,560 --> 02:55:28,560
Mother's animal cookies.

2300
02:55:28,560 --> 02:55:29,560
Those are the best.

2301
02:55:29,560 --> 02:55:30,560
Good shit.

2302
02:55:30,560 --> 02:55:31,560
Yes, they are.

2303
02:55:31,560 --> 02:55:32,560
I wouldn't care if I was vegan.

2304
02:55:32,560 --> 02:55:33,560
I'd still eat them.

2305
02:55:33,560 --> 02:55:34,560
They're so fat.

2306
02:55:34,560 --> 02:55:39,540
I'm just reminded of an old question.

2307
02:55:39,540 --> 02:55:42,000
Do vegans swallow?

2308
02:55:42,000 --> 02:55:45,520
Yes, and I know.

2309
02:55:45,520 --> 02:55:49,520
Okay, too much ice today to vegan.

2310
02:55:49,520 --> 02:55:53,520
Whale.

2311
02:55:53,520 --> 02:55:57,520
Oh, Tao says as a vegetarian he would just like to say yes he can eat

2312
02:55:57,520 --> 02:56:01,520
animal cookies. So there you go, there's your question. You learn something new on Orange Lounge Radio every day.

2313
02:56:01,520 --> 02:56:05,520
We're still accepting questions for Ask Orange Lounge by the way, just send them over a private

2314
02:56:05,520 --> 02:56:09,520
message to Sky in the chat room. No, we still have a few left. Biohazard

2315
02:56:09,520 --> 02:56:13,520
sent me plenty to get us through a whole other show.

2316
02:56:13,520 --> 02:56:18,000
www.calibomani.com, click on Orange Lounge, and click on chat.

2317
02:56:18,000 --> 02:56:19,240
NoStylin, oh god.

2318
02:56:19,240 --> 02:56:20,200
Oh, god.

2319
02:56:20,200 --> 02:56:20,960
Here it is.

2320
02:56:20,960 --> 02:56:22,880
No, here it is.

2321
02:56:22,880 --> 02:56:25,360
It's actually a good question.

2322
02:56:25,360 --> 02:56:26,400
Here it is.

2323
02:56:26,400 --> 02:56:29,360
How come you guys don't play more Eurobeat?

2324
02:56:33,760 --> 02:56:36,720
I guess my theory would be because to a lot of people

2325
02:56:36,720 --> 02:56:39,080
who don't know Eurobeat, it all sounds exactly the same.

2326
02:56:39,080 --> 02:56:46,080
No Stylin also says there should be a Bimani Eurobeat hour.

2327
02:56:46,080 --> 02:56:47,080
No!

2328
02:56:47,080 --> 02:56:49,080
God, no!

2329
02:56:49,080 --> 02:56:51,080
What the hell is wrong with you?

2330
02:56:51,080 --> 02:56:54,080
What was the question?

2331
02:56:54,080 --> 02:56:56,080
Why doesn't Orange Lounge Radio play more Eurobeat?

2332
02:56:56,080 --> 02:56:58,080
We can play more Eurobeat.

2333
02:56:58,080 --> 02:57:00,080
Jamie's done Eurobeat pre-shows.

2334
02:57:00,080 --> 02:57:04,080
I've done, like, hours of Eurobeat on my show, too.

2335
02:57:04,080 --> 02:57:05,080
You know what?

2336
02:57:05,080 --> 02:57:06,080
Tune in to Jamie's show, because she's the biggest Eurobeat fan.

2337
02:57:06,080 --> 02:57:11,440
I was at a two-hour marathon of Eurobeat a couple weeks ago.

2338
02:57:11,440 --> 02:57:12,440
So you know what?

2339
02:57:12,440 --> 02:57:15,320
If you don't think we play enough Eurobeat, you're listening to the wrong shows.

2340
02:57:15,320 --> 02:57:20,160
Listen to Tuesday night's Pump of the Volume.

2341
02:57:20,160 --> 02:57:22,280
I am not vegan, God no.

2342
02:57:22,280 --> 02:57:25,120
Like I have that kind of discipline, one of my exes is.

2343
02:57:25,120 --> 02:57:30,680
He made this really good eggplant stuff at a party at my house.

2344
02:57:30,680 --> 02:57:32,320
And nobody ate it but you and I?

2345
02:57:32,320 --> 02:57:34,320
Well, I ate lots of it.

2346
02:57:34,320 --> 02:57:40,200
was good. John Fields would like to know, what do you call a river that's too big for

2347
02:57:40,200 --> 02:57:49,760
its bridges? You need to shut up right now. That was the worst pun ever. That was a pun

2348
02:57:49,760 --> 02:57:54,840
straight out of 23rd Magus's book. You owe Magus a quarter. Give him a quarter. Pay them

2349
02:57:54,840 --> 02:57:59,960
royalties and we'll stick the RIAA on you. Take it now. We'll stick the RIAA on you if

2350
02:57:59,960 --> 02:58:00,960
We don't.

2351
02:58:00,960 --> 02:58:02,400
No styling has another question.

2352
02:58:02,400 --> 02:58:03,400
God.

2353
02:58:03,400 --> 02:58:08,360
What came first, the egg or the chicken?

2354
02:58:08,360 --> 02:58:09,640
Depends on your religion.

2355
02:58:09,640 --> 02:58:13,840
Well, in that sentence, the egg came first in your sentence, so.

2356
02:58:13,840 --> 02:58:16,520
Yes, Loki.

2357
02:58:16,520 --> 02:58:21,080
Get a mic.

2358
02:58:21,080 --> 02:58:25,000
The chicken and egg rhetorical question is the dumbest thing ever because it's not actually

2359
02:58:25,000 --> 02:58:26,000
a rhetorical question.

2360
02:58:26,000 --> 02:58:29,120
They did not specify what type of an egg it was.

2361
02:58:29,120 --> 02:58:32,160
Therefore, dinosaurs predated chickens.

2362
02:58:32,160 --> 02:58:33,720
Therefore, the egg came first.

2363
02:58:37,720 --> 02:58:39,200
People would have an answer.

2364
02:58:39,200 --> 02:58:39,700
Wow.

2365
02:58:39,700 --> 02:58:41,000
Philosophical moment.

2366
02:58:41,000 --> 02:58:42,640
That was deep.

2367
02:58:42,640 --> 02:58:45,920
That was deep like a puddle.

2368
02:58:45,920 --> 02:58:48,760
All right.

2369
02:58:48,760 --> 02:58:51,600
Going back to biohazards questions,

2370
02:58:51,600 --> 02:58:53,440
because that's all the questions we have left,

2371
02:58:53,440 --> 02:58:56,920
unless people send more over private messages to Skye.

2372
02:58:56,920 --> 02:58:58,880
Do you think that it's safe?

2373
02:58:58,880 --> 02:58:59,880
No.

2374
02:58:59,880 --> 02:59:00,880
No.

2375
02:59:00,880 --> 02:59:05,720
You're listening to the show, aren't you?

2376
02:59:05,720 --> 02:59:08,440
The chat room's talking about their vegetarian stints.

2377
02:59:08,440 --> 02:59:10,600
I have actually had a vegetarian stint.

2378
02:59:10,600 --> 02:59:13,240
I was vegetarian for about a month.

2379
02:59:13,240 --> 02:59:14,300
You know what?

2380
02:59:14,300 --> 02:59:16,600
I want to bet doing it.

2381
02:59:16,600 --> 02:59:24,680
This is, as of April, made two years that I've gone without beef or pork on a regular

2382
02:59:24,680 --> 02:59:25,680
basis.

2383
02:59:25,680 --> 02:59:30,100
I had a nibble now and then, but I've stayed off of it.

2384
02:59:30,100 --> 02:59:32,820
I would like to say, I have not drank regular soda

2385
02:59:32,820 --> 02:59:34,280
in about six months.

2386
02:59:34,280 --> 02:59:35,900
But I need to cut back on diet, though,

2387
02:59:35,900 --> 02:59:36,940
because I do drink diet.

2388
02:59:36,940 --> 02:59:38,280
Diet says it's worse for you.

2389
02:59:38,280 --> 02:59:42,620
I haven't smoked a cigarette in four years.

2390
02:59:42,620 --> 02:59:45,100
You know, I haven't smoked a cigarette in five and a half

2391
02:59:45,100 --> 02:59:45,700
years.

2392
02:59:45,700 --> 02:59:49,340
I haven't smoked a cigarette in a week.

2393
02:59:49,340 --> 02:59:50,980
You are so square.

2394
02:59:50,980 --> 02:59:52,540
I know, aren't I?

2395
02:59:52,540 --> 02:59:57,540
Biohazard would also like to know

2396
02:59:57,540 --> 03:00:00,660
Why haven't I heard any ferrets yet? Did you burn them?

2397
03:00:00,660 --> 03:00:05,340
Obviously we have not. Those ferrets won't go away.

2398
03:00:05,340 --> 03:00:10,260
Thanks. Here's a somewhat serious question from Biohazard. Biohazard would like to know

2399
03:00:10,260 --> 03:00:14,980
why can't we vote for Holik? Because we said so and we are the authority.

2400
03:00:14,980 --> 03:00:19,380
Because I have the real answer to the question. Holik is already in rotation on

2401
03:00:19,380 --> 03:00:22,180
the station therefore if you vote for it you're voting a song

2402
03:00:22,180 --> 03:00:27,020
into rotation. It's already in rotation. You don't need to vote for Holik. You rhymed,

2403
03:00:27,020 --> 03:00:32,580
Rob. I rhymed. I'm great. Rotation on the station. Rotation on the station. It's a fucking

2404
03:00:32,580 --> 03:00:39,580
Rode beat song. Now you sound like you're spitting on the microphone. It's just that

2405
03:00:41,700 --> 03:00:48,700
talented song. What is the meaning of life expressed through interpretive dance in front

2406
03:00:48,700 --> 03:00:51,340
Press through interpretive dance in front of the webcam.

2407
03:00:51,340 --> 03:00:52,340
42.

2408
03:00:52,340 --> 03:01:00,300
Hold on, in about 10 seconds I'm going to show you the next webcam image I will be showing

2409
03:01:00,300 --> 03:01:04,940
you the meaning of life and I will be getting help from the others showing you the meaning

2410
03:01:04,940 --> 03:01:05,940
of life.

2411
03:01:05,940 --> 03:01:06,940
There it goes.

2412
03:01:06,940 --> 03:01:13,820
Four, two, one, there the meaning of life is up there on our cam for you to see right

2413
03:01:13,820 --> 03:01:15,820
now.

2414
03:01:15,820 --> 03:01:19,820
Alright.

2415
03:01:19,820 --> 03:01:23,820
I got your meat of the life.

2416
03:01:23,820 --> 03:01:27,820
His last question is, why do I ask so many questions?

2417
03:01:27,820 --> 03:01:31,820
Because you suck. No way, he answered his own questions?

2418
03:01:31,820 --> 03:01:35,820
This is the meaning of life.

2419
03:01:35,820 --> 03:01:39,820
No.

2420
03:01:39,820 --> 03:01:43,820
Wait, wait, wait, he answered his own question, nevermind.

2421
03:01:43,820 --> 03:01:48,820
I think it skipped the picture.

2422
03:01:48,820 --> 03:01:50,820
It's not there.

2423
03:01:50,820 --> 03:01:51,820
Bummer.

2424
03:01:51,820 --> 03:01:57,940
23rd Magus would like to know, will you people stop fucking stealing my jokes, puns or my

2425
03:01:57,940 --> 03:01:58,940
department bitches?

2426
03:01:58,940 --> 03:01:59,940
Hey, you know what?

2427
03:01:59,940 --> 03:02:00,940
What's the meaning of life?

2428
03:02:00,940 --> 03:02:03,420
Did you write the information for Max 2?

2429
03:02:03,420 --> 03:02:04,420
I don't think so.

2430
03:02:04,420 --> 03:02:05,660
Did you write the information screens for that?

2431
03:02:05,660 --> 03:02:06,660
I don't think so.

2432
03:02:06,660 --> 03:02:10,220
Therefore, you suck at puns.

2433
03:02:10,220 --> 03:02:15,500
No Stylin would like to know, how many sounds does the ferret have? About seven.

2434
03:02:15,500 --> 03:02:18,100
And we don't need to hear them all.

2435
03:02:18,100 --> 03:02:19,740
Look at the webcam right now.

2436
03:02:19,740 --> 03:02:21,700
John Fields would like to know,

2437
03:02:21,700 --> 03:02:26,660
any interest in any of the games that are being shown at Tokyo Game Show?

2438
03:02:26,660 --> 03:02:33,180
Well, DDR Party Edition, I guess.

2439
03:02:33,180 --> 03:02:34,280
Otherwise,

2440
03:02:34,280 --> 03:02:38,280
otherwise I don't really give a shit, I find. You know what? We'll see them when we

2441
03:02:38,280 --> 03:02:39,100
see them.

2442
03:02:39,100 --> 03:02:41,760
Who cares if they're coming out in Tokyo? We need them out here.

2443
03:02:41,760 --> 03:02:45,500
Say this really great role-playing game comes out in Japan. Guess what? It's in Japanese.

2444
03:02:45,500 --> 03:02:48,220
It doesn't matter. I can't read it.

2445
03:02:48,220 --> 03:02:55,220
Hey, but if they put out another grandiose, I'll import it.

2446
03:02:56,560 --> 03:02:59,380
No.

2447
03:02:59,380 --> 03:03:03,820
A biohazard would also like to know, am I infamous for my bad questions yet?

2448
03:03:03,820 --> 03:03:08,360
Actually, no. You just kind of act stupid to us.

2449
03:03:08,360 --> 03:03:10,760
You sure are famous.

2450
03:03:10,760 --> 03:03:13,560
23rd Magus would like to know, is it true that Jason Enos asked

2451
03:03:13,560 --> 03:03:15,640
for my help in writing the info screens?

2452
03:03:15,640 --> 03:03:19,000
No, you made that up.

2453
03:03:19,000 --> 03:03:21,040
All right, let's close up the mailbag.

2454
03:03:21,040 --> 03:03:22,920
Thank you, everybody, for playing Ask Orange Lounge.

2455
03:03:22,920 --> 03:03:24,960
You know what we haven't looked at in a long time, Rob?

2456
03:03:24,960 --> 03:03:25,480
Sorry.

2457
03:03:25,480 --> 03:03:26,720
Our actual mail.

2458
03:03:26,720 --> 03:03:29,760
Hold on.

2459
03:03:29,760 --> 03:03:33,400
Now we're done with Ask Orange Lounge Radio.

2460
03:03:33,400 --> 03:03:35,160
We hope you learned something tonight

2461
03:03:35,160 --> 03:03:37,160
on Ask Orange Lounge Radio.

2462
03:03:37,160 --> 03:03:44,160
Hey, guess what? Next week, the Ferrets will be here because I'm going to go outside and run them over with my car.

2463
03:03:47,160 --> 03:03:48,160
Alright.

2464
03:03:51,160 --> 03:03:52,160
Let's see if...

2465
03:03:54,160 --> 03:03:57,160
Let's... I'm just hoping the batteries fucking die someday.

2466
03:03:58,160 --> 03:04:00,160
As are half our listeners, I'm sure. Okay.

2467
03:04:00,160 --> 03:04:05,440
Okay. The show would not be the same without the Ferret. The Ferret is our mascot.

2468
03:04:05,440 --> 03:04:10,680
Yeah, we're actually checking our actual email address

2469
03:04:10,680 --> 03:04:14,720

2470
03:04:14,720 --> 03:04:15,320

03:04:15,320 --> 03:04:19,240
and it's spam. Let's see.

2472
03:04:19,240 --> 03:04:23,900

2479
03:04:48,640 --> 03:04:52,820
have in our mailbag if you'd like to fill up our mailbag orange lounge radio

2480
03:04:52,820 --> 03:04:57,200
at yahoo.com all right we have some more ask orange last questions I'm taking

2481
03:04:57,200 --> 03:05:00,640
these last three and that's it we're finishing this bit and we're ending the

2482
03:05:00,640 --> 03:05:04,560
show. Here's some ferret ass for you. FileHazard wants to know what was the date of the

2483
03:05:04,560 --> 03:05:10,080
first Orange Lounge radio show? The date of the first live show is July or sorry

2484
03:05:10,080 --> 03:05:19,160
June 23rd 2002. The station first went on air I think May 18th of that

2485
03:05:19,160 --> 03:05:26,720
year May 18th or 22nd somewhere in there. The first live show is June 23rd 2002.

2486
03:05:26,720 --> 03:05:34,200
No Stylin wants to know, when will there be another Pimpin' Hoes party?

2487
03:05:34,200 --> 03:05:37,920
He's referring to my birthday party, which he wasn't at, so I don't know how he knows

2488
03:05:37,920 --> 03:05:44,400
this, but I think someone he talks to a lot was part of the brains behind that party.

2489
03:05:44,400 --> 03:05:48,760
Maybe for someone else's birthday, I don't know.

2490
03:05:48,760 --> 03:05:54,040
Maybe for my next birthday, I'd love to have another Pimpin' Hoes party.

2491
03:05:54,040 --> 03:05:58,140
Pimino's party, it was my birthday and some folks came over here on a Sunday morning and

2492
03:05:58,140 --> 03:06:01,340
surprised me and they all dressed like hoes and pimps.

2493
03:06:01,340 --> 03:06:05,060
They brought over cake and it was kind of like a Hawaiian Pimps and Hoes party actually

2494
03:06:05,060 --> 03:06:11,060
because they were wearing Hawaiian coconut boobs and little leis, colored rainbow leis

2495
03:06:11,060 --> 03:06:12,060
and stuff.

2496
03:06:12,060 --> 03:06:13,060
It was fun.

2497
03:06:13,060 --> 03:06:14,360
We had chicken and waffles.

2498
03:06:14,360 --> 03:06:17,620
We had Eggos and Popeye's chicken.

2499
03:06:17,620 --> 03:06:21,460
By the way, live on the webcam, the ferret eats Loki's head.

2500
03:06:21,460 --> 03:06:22,460
Hooray.

2501
03:06:22,460 --> 03:06:30,220
Alright, guys, guess what? It's time to wrap up the show. Thank God this week's show went

2502
03:06:30,220 --> 03:06:34,180
okay unlike last week's show which we're writing off and forgetting about forever. It's time

2503
03:06:34,180 --> 03:06:39,820
for me to go around to collect the final thoughts. Let's start with Bradley. Does he have a microphone

2504
03:06:39,820 --> 03:06:49,820
over there? Jamie. Have you ever really looked at your toes? They look weird. Yeah, they

2505
03:06:49,820 --> 03:06:53,780
They do look weird.

2506
03:06:53,780 --> 03:06:57,060
I'm not Asian, and I don't know how to use chopsticks.

2507
03:06:57,060 --> 03:06:58,060
Thank you, Puppy.

2508
03:06:58,060 --> 03:06:59,060
Erin.

2509
03:06:59,060 --> 03:07:04,740
Uh, thanks to me, Puppy has now learned how to pick up Mike and Ike candies with his chopsticks.

2510
03:07:04,740 --> 03:07:06,740
But I'm still not Asian.

2511
03:07:06,740 --> 03:07:10,460
We realize that, but now you're one step closer to being Asian!

2512
03:07:10,460 --> 03:07:11,460
Woohoo!

2513
03:07:11,460 --> 03:07:16,460
I actually like that one.

2514
03:07:16,460 --> 03:07:19,540
Logie, your final thought?

2515
03:07:19,540 --> 03:07:22,500
I solder.

2516
03:07:22,500 --> 03:07:25,020
Great.

2517
03:07:25,020 --> 03:07:33,300
Uh, my final thought is, um, I hope I don't decide to flake on the show next week, because

2518
03:07:33,300 --> 03:07:36,220
the Castro Street Fair does sound tempting.

2519
03:07:36,220 --> 03:07:37,220
What on Sunday?

2520
03:07:37,220 --> 03:07:38,220
Next Sunday, yeah.

2521
03:07:38,220 --> 03:07:40,580
I'm thinking about flaking on the show, but I don't know.

2522
03:07:40,580 --> 03:07:42,180
Don't worry, I'll fill in your part.

2523
03:07:42,180 --> 03:07:43,180
We'll see.

2524
03:07:43,180 --> 03:07:44,180
We'll see.

2525
03:07:44,180 --> 03:07:45,180
I can...

2526
03:07:45,180 --> 03:07:46,180
We'll see.

2527
03:07:46,180 --> 03:08:13,680
I'm having way too much fun with the webcam.

2528
03:08:13,680 --> 03:08:17,840
The final word of the show, I'm going to give it to Bradley because he never talks and I

2529
03:08:17,840 --> 03:08:19,920
want him to give the final word tonight.

2530
03:08:19,920 --> 03:08:20,920
Terraforming.

2531
03:08:20,920 --> 03:08:25,440
You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

2532
03:08:25,440 --> 03:08:29,800
Orange Lounge Radio is hosted by Dark Sakura, Sky and Loki.

2533
03:08:29,800 --> 03:08:32,160
We expect you a nice play again.

2534
03:08:32,160 --> 03:08:35,840
And now, here's your fortune cookie message of the day.

2535
03:08:35,840 --> 03:08:37,140
Pardon me.

2536
03:08:37,140 --> 03:08:38,320
Now it begins.

2537
03:08:38,320 --> 03:08:39,840
Who all here is evil?

2538
03:08:39,840 --> 03:08:40,840
Sound off.

2539
03:08:40,840 --> 03:08:41,840
I'm evil.

2540
03:08:41,840 --> 03:08:42,840
I'm evil.

2541
03:08:42,840 --> 03:08:44,040
No, you are not.

2542
03:08:44,040 --> 03:08:46,040
Oh, I am, too!

2543
03:08:46,040 --> 03:08:50,740
You're as harmless as a baby's... butt.

2544
03:08:50,740 --> 03:08:51,540
Zorak?

2545
03:08:51,540 --> 03:08:52,540
Well, he is.

2546
03:08:52,540 --> 03:08:54,240
I'm not a baby's butt.

2547
03:08:54,240 --> 03:08:57,740
Brack, I'm going to have to go with Zorak on this one.

2548
03:08:57,740 --> 03:09:01,140
You simply don't have the mental capacity to be evil.

2549
03:09:01,140 --> 03:09:02,140
See?

2550
03:09:02,140 --> 03:09:03,240
I don't get it.

2551
03:09:03,240 --> 03:09:07,440
You see, Brack, you have to be able to come up with, oh, say, plots against the universe.

2552
03:09:07,440 --> 03:09:12,440
You have to hatch evil plans to conquer planets and be just plain mean most of the time.

2553
03:09:12,440 --> 03:09:14,940
You're just too nice.

2554
03:09:14,940 --> 03:09:19,540
I forget how to be mean, not if radiation half-lipotomized me.

2555
03:09:19,540 --> 03:09:25,640
Hey, I've got an idea. Let Zorak teach you how to be mean.

2556
03:09:25,640 --> 03:09:28,140
Oh, man. Do I have to?

2557
03:09:28,140 --> 03:09:29,840
Yes, you have to.

2558
03:09:29,840 --> 03:09:32,240
Okay, Bragg, repeat after me.

2559
03:09:32,240 --> 03:09:33,540
Space ghost.

2560
03:09:33,540 --> 03:09:34,940
Space ghost!

2561
03:09:34,940 --> 03:09:37,240
I will destroy you.

2562
03:09:37,240 --> 03:09:40,140
I will destroy you, if you don't mind.

2563
03:09:40,140 --> 03:09:42,440
I will destroy you!

2564
03:09:42,440 --> 03:09:44,540
Oh, I'm sorry, wait, I'll get it.

2565
03:09:44,540 --> 03:09:45,840
I will destroy you!

2566
03:09:45,840 --> 03:09:48,440
I will destroy you!

2567
03:09:48,440 --> 03:09:51,340
All right! I will destroy you!

2568
03:09:51,340 --> 03:09:54,040
You, and your little dog, too.

2569
03:09:54,040 --> 03:09:57,440
You and your little dog!

2570
03:09:57,440 --> 03:10:00,540
Hey, I like this dog.

2571
03:10:00,540 --> 03:10:02,740
Francine is a good puppy!

2572
03:10:02,740 --> 03:10:05,240
No, that was just a threat.

2573
03:10:05,240 --> 03:10:07,640
You wanna hurt Francine?

2574
03:10:07,640 --> 03:10:16,120

2577
03:10:35,480 --> 03:10:38,480
Hey, wait, I don't have a dog.

2578
03:10:38,480 --> 03:10:45,480
Yeah, tell me about it.

2579
03:10:45,480 --> 03:10:47,320
Thanks for listening and we'll see you next week.

2580
03:11:15,480 --> 03:11:19,480
Alright, we're in the Orange Launch Radio after birth.

2581
03:11:19,480 --> 03:11:21,480
As promised, we won't make you wait any longer.

2582
03:11:21,480 --> 03:11:24,360
Here it is one more time overloaded lesson two

2583
03:12:51,480 --> 03:13:11,600
Okay, we're going to be adding that song into our rotation, by the way on Orange Launch

2584
03:13:11,600 --> 03:13:13,040
Radio's Bamante Music and More program.

2585
03:13:13,040 --> 03:13:16,520
So if you like that and can't get enough of it, don't worry, you'll get to hear more very

2586
03:13:16,520 --> 03:13:17,640
soon.

2587
03:13:17,640 --> 03:13:19,560
Welcome to the Orange Launch Radio Afterbirth.

2588
03:13:19,560 --> 03:13:23,560
You are a scary woman, Miss Erin, with your whip.

2589
03:13:23,560 --> 03:13:26,560
When's going to be another tournament where you can beat me up?

2590
03:13:26,560 --> 03:13:27,560
I don't know.

2591
03:13:27,560 --> 03:13:28,560
I don't know.

2592
03:13:28,560 --> 03:13:29,560
There isn't.

2593
03:13:29,560 --> 03:13:33,560
Well, if she has tooth any time soon, she'll probably end up being a cell driver there.

2594
03:13:33,560 --> 03:13:34,560
Yeah, probably.

2595
03:13:34,560 --> 03:13:40,560
Well, see the thing is, I haven't, there haven't been any real good NorCal tournaments coming

2596
03:13:40,560 --> 03:13:41,560
out.

2597
03:13:41,560 --> 03:13:46,560
You know, after, after the last year barrage of tournaments, it was kind of tired it out

2598
03:13:46,560 --> 03:13:48,560
and now it's just, well.

2599
03:13:48,560 --> 03:13:51,520
I'm kind of sad that I heard about the tournament in nickel city today

2600
03:13:51,760 --> 03:13:54,560
They were having a puzzle fire tournament and only one person showed up

2601
03:13:55,120 --> 03:13:57,120
Oh, man, I played him today and beat him

2602
03:13:58,560 --> 03:14:04,960
No, did you go no I played no I played you know, what's his name that was going to be there, uh, forget his name

2603
03:14:05,760 --> 03:14:09,440
Um, but anyways, yeah, um, so we played him and I won

2604
03:14:10,000 --> 03:14:13,600
But because he made a mistake and uh, but it was I don't know

2605
03:14:13,600 --> 03:14:25,600
I think it would be cool to have a puzzle fighter tournament because I know people in the Bay Area are pretty hardcore in that stuff, but I don't know how a DDR tournament is going to work out too well there.

2606
03:14:27,600 --> 03:14:31,600
Alright, anything else we want to share in the afterbirth? Jamie, have anything?

2607
03:14:31,600 --> 03:14:37,600
Go to www.fanimatrix.net

2608
03:14:37,600 --> 03:14:39,600
They have a pretty cool...

2609
03:14:39,600 --> 03:14:43,600
Well, go to BitTorrent. They have BitTorrent links.

2610
03:14:43,600 --> 03:14:47,600
Anyways, they have BitTorrent links for the movie.

2611
03:14:47,600 --> 03:14:55,600
It's a ten minute, or about ten minute fan film that's done by professional actors, professional stuntmen, special effects and whatnot, cinematography.

2612
03:14:55,600 --> 03:15:01,960
There's kind of like a practice movie forum and a fan movie and it's basically a bunch of New Zealand actors

2613
03:15:01,960 --> 03:15:03,640
You know doing this

2614
03:15:03,640 --> 03:15:08,580
Kind of prequel to the matrix is pretty sweet. So you should go check that out. They're talking about doing

2615
03:15:09,100 --> 03:15:14,000
Sequels and stuff later on but it's the first movie is called Phantom Matrix

2616
03:15:14,000 --> 03:15:26,000

03:15:26,000 --> 03:15:29,000

2618
03:15:29,000 --> 03:15:34,000

2619
03:15:34,000 --> 03:15:36,000

Just a random order, you guys, so hopefully the song you want will come up soon.

So wanna tell the world about

2658
03:26:28,860 --> 03:26:45,200
Water

2659
03:28:58,860 --> 03:29:01,900
R

2660
03:29:01,900 --> 03:29:04,900
E

2661
03:29:04,900 --> 03:29:07,900
E

2662
03:29:07,900 --> 03:29:10,900
R

2663
03:29:10,900 --> 03:29:13,900
E

2664
03:29:13,900 --> 03:29:16,900

2668
03:29:25,900 --> 03:29:31,900
This is the end of the video, thank you so much for watching, and I'll see you in the next one.

2669
03:29:55,900 --> 03:30:08,460
Here always comes the times when everything is down

2670
03:30:08,460 --> 03:30:14,200
And it seems hard to find all the paths To get us like the hope

2671
03:30:14,200 --> 03:30:18,620
And when the dreams come true comes reality

2672
03:30:18,620 --> 03:30:23,980
So keep your head up and try to hold your spirit

2673
03:30:23,980 --> 03:30:29,580
Right when you get the place you'll see the sky

2674
03:30:29,580 --> 03:30:33,980
And fly high in the air

2675
03:30:33,980 --> 03:30:38,980
Bring out your hands, through the clouds

2676
03:30:38,980 --> 03:30:44,480
Cast away because there's light in your soul

2677
03:30:44,480 --> 03:30:48,280
And it's bound to fall somewhere

2678
03:30:48,280 --> 03:30:53,780
So reach out to the clouds, try to cast

2679
03:30:53,780 --> 03:30:55,780
Very sad

2680
03:30:55,780 --> 03:30:58,780
But your heart and your soul

2681
03:30:58,780 --> 03:31:00,780
See a thing
