WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:03.500
Synchronize as love is what we've got to do

00:03.500 --> 00:07.000
All the time we'll be together

00:07.000 --> 00:10.500
Cause it's yours and mine forever

00:10.500 --> 00:13.000
We're in this love team

00:13.000 --> 00:15.000
I won't be a man

00:15.000 --> 00:19.000
So tonight we're gonna live the night away

00:19.000 --> 00:21.000
One and one is two

00:21.000 --> 00:23.000
Don't you be so cruel

00:23.000 --> 00:27.000
Synchronize as love is what we've got to do

00:27.000 --> 00:30.360
All the time we'll be together

00:30.360 --> 00:33.000
Cause it's yours and mine

00:33.000 --> 00:37.000
Forever we're in the dark

00:51.000 --> 00:53.000
Turn around

00:53.000 --> 01:06.000
Look at what you see in her face The mirror of your dreams

01:06.000 --> 01:14.000
Make believe I'm everywhere Give in the light

01:14.000 --> 01:26.000
Isn't all the fadin' The answer to a neverending story

01:26.000 --> 01:54.000
Reach the stars, light a fantasy Dream a dream, and what you see will be

01:54.000 --> 01:57.000
To keep their secrets

01:57.000 --> 02:01.000
When I go behind the clouds

02:01.000 --> 02:04.000
And there upon the rainbow

02:04.000 --> 02:07.000
They'll give me the answer to

02:07.000 --> 02:13.000
A never-ending story

02:43.000 --> 03:08.400
When you shun your fear, for she may fade away

03:08.400 --> 03:10.400
in your hands

03:10.400 --> 03:15.400
the birth of a new day

03:15.400 --> 03:19.400
the mind could keep their secret

03:19.400 --> 03:23.400
they'll fall behind a pound

03:23.400 --> 03:27.400
and therefore the reign of peace

03:27.400 --> 03:35.000
In the answer to a never-ending story

03:38.600 --> 03:42.600
Never-ending story

03:46.600 --> 03:50.600
Never-ending story

04:50.600 --> 04:52.600
Yeah

05:20.600 --> 05:22.600
Hey

07:20.600 --> 07:22.600
And you can take away

07:22.600 --> 07:24.200
Oh, kurau kou kou kou malerika

07:24.200 --> 07:26.200
Waku malakiru

07:26.200 --> 07:29.200
But I'm not your hero, she's a stinker

07:29.200 --> 07:58.200
Toto, I have a feeling we're not in Kansas anymore.

07:58.200 --> 08:06.520
You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio, the Monty Talk and then some.

08:06.520 --> 08:10.120
Uh, mostly the and then some part of that.

08:10.120 --> 08:14.760
Orange Lounge Radio is created by a bunch of potty-mouthed adults.

08:14.760 --> 08:19.960
Orange Lounge may contain sexual, perverted, and mildly retarded content.

08:19.960 --> 08:23.720
You probably shouldn't let your children listen to Orange Lounge Radio.

08:23.720 --> 08:25.840
Yes, I will spank your child.

08:25.840 --> 08:54.560
If you're not going to do your job, goddammit, I will.

08:54.560 --> 09:01.560
Searching for a boy in high school is useless, but searching for meaning in a poly shoreline.

09:01.560 --> 09:06.560
Oh yeah? Well, I hope your babies look like monkeys.

09:06.560 --> 09:07.560
Dark Sakura.

09:07.560 --> 09:08.560
I've had a sniff.

09:08.560 --> 09:09.560
Sky.

09:09.560 --> 09:11.560
But I'm playing it for the bartender, so suffer.

09:11.560 --> 09:12.560
Loki.

09:12.560 --> 09:13.560
I hate you!

09:13.560 --> 09:18.560

09:48.800 --> 09:55.940
Can opener is in the second drawer down.

09:55.940 --> 09:58.320
Second drawer down, not including the cutting board.

09:58.320 --> 10:01.120
There you go.

10:01.120 --> 10:08.080

12:26.220 --> 12:32.220
And we ripped them ourselves. They're a little amateurish, but they got the job done.

12:32.220 --> 12:33.220
Good job!

12:33.220 --> 12:39.220
We got those and a whole lot of other stuff to talk about tonight, so we'll be back.

12:39.220 --> 12:42.220
Cage match, possibly a list list if we have time for it.

12:42.220 --> 12:43.220
All your favorite.

12:43.220 --> 12:46.220
FUs of the Week coming up a little bit later.

12:46.220 --> 12:52.220
And Jamie Cooking for all of you out there.

12:52.220 --> 12:55.220
She'll be holding it up to the webcam and you can lick your screen.

12:55.220 --> 13:01.220
So to get our webcam address, head on over to our website, www.calibomani.com.

13:01.220 --> 13:04.420
click on orange lounge and click on chat

13:04.420 --> 13:06.020
and then our chat room will be more than happy

13:06.020 --> 13:07.180
to give you the link to the webcam

13:07.180 --> 13:08.620
because it's got a really long URL

13:08.620 --> 13:10.320
and I don't say it over the air.

13:10.320 --> 13:12.040
All right, we'll be back after this.

13:12.040 --> 13:14.620
We're gonna start off with a little bit of ecstasy,

13:14.620 --> 13:16.420
bad routine and busy child.

13:16.420 --> 13:17.260
We'll be back.

13:17.260 --> 13:24.940
A little bit of ecstasy A little bit of you and me

13:24.940 --> 13:32.420
A little bit of s grocery free A little bit of ecstasy

13:32.420 --> 13:40.120
A little bit of ecstasy A little bit of you and me

13:40.120 --> 13:55.120
Tell me that you want me, tell me that you need me

13:55.120 --> 14:03.120
Tell me that you want me, tell me that you love me

14:03.120 --> 14:07.120
I'll be your dream

14:07.120 --> 14:10.600
be my fantasy

14:10.600 --> 14:14.480
I'll be your dream

14:14.480 --> 14:18.000
be my fantasy

14:18.000 --> 14:25.640
I'll be your dream

14:25.640 --> 14:30.640
I'll be the dream

14:34.640 --> 14:38.640
I'll be the dream

14:39.640 --> 14:42.640
With my friends and me

14:43.640 --> 14:46.640
Ooh, yeah

14:47.640 --> 14:49.640
Let the dream come true

14:50.640 --> 14:51.640
Let the dream come true

14:51.640 --> 14:54.640
Let the beat control your body

14:54.640 --> 14:58.640
A little bit of ecstasy

15:24.640 --> 15:31.880
Yeah, I hope you love me more than I do

15:31.880 --> 15:46.760
Yeah, I hope you love me more than I do

16:16.760 --> 16:17.760
Yeah!

16:17.760 --> 16:19.260
That's what they call our love.

16:19.260 --> 16:21.260
Yeah!

16:21.260 --> 16:22.260
Yeah!

16:22.260 --> 16:23.260
Oh, oh.

16:23.260 --> 16:24.260
Oh, oh.

16:24.260 --> 16:25.260
Yeah!

16:25.260 --> 16:27.260
Oh!

16:27.260 --> 16:28.260
Yeah!

16:28.260 --> 16:29.260
Oh!

16:29.260 --> 16:30.260
Oh!

16:30.260 --> 16:32.260
Oh!

16:32.260 --> 16:33.260
Oh!

16:33.260 --> 16:53.180
I guess I didn't know I guess I didn't know

16:53.180 --> 17:15.140
Get Busy Time Get Busy Time

18:15.140 --> 18:38.300
Please listen to Orange Lounge Radio, because real radio makes Captain Jack cry.

18:38.300 --> 18:42.180
Hello and welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 62.

18:42.180 --> 18:44.900
And we're playing Max 2 USA MP3s tonight.

18:44.900 --> 18:47.860
So in that break you heard a little bit of ecstasy, bad routine, and busy child.

18:47.860 --> 18:49.140
We're just going to hit them in alphabetical order.

18:49.140 --> 18:52.280
We've got 15 songs to play tonight, five breaks we usually do.

18:52.280 --> 18:56.100
So we'll have just enough to put us through the rest of the show.

18:56.100 --> 19:00.140
So speaking of Max 2 USA, it's the big news this week, Wednesday.

19:00.140 --> 19:03.260
We haven't had a new DDR game in the USA for over a year.

19:03.260 --> 19:06.660
We haven't really seen any new DDR of any kind, unless you live in Europe.

19:06.660 --> 19:09.700
You haven't seen any new DDR of any kind since Extreme in January.

19:09.700 --> 19:12.060
So this is like big news this week.

19:12.060 --> 19:20.540
So, what did you guys think? Best damn home version ever. Why? Because it's got so many

19:20.540 --> 19:26.260
licensed tracks that are unique to the game that they actually put some thought into what

19:26.260 --> 19:32.140
songs to put in and actually did a good job of it. Well, yeah, but this is better. Max

19:32.140 --> 19:39.140
X2 is 20 times better.

19:39.140 --> 19:44.260
Any particular favorites?

19:44.260 --> 19:49.340
They had Xenon in it and I like pissed my pants when I unlocked it.

19:49.340 --> 19:51.740
You didn't spoil, I went and spoiled the list.

19:51.740 --> 19:54.380
I went on Wednesday morning and read the whole damn list.

19:54.380 --> 19:55.380
I would just want to know.

19:55.380 --> 19:57.460
I want to know what the hell was in the game.

19:57.460 --> 20:04.260
I didn't even go online Wednesday until, like, when I was halfway through unlocking it, when

20:04.260 --> 20:08.140
I was going to go online and see how far you guys were into it.

20:08.140 --> 20:09.140
Yeah.

20:09.140 --> 20:11.220
Hopefully you were listening to us on Wednesday.

20:11.220 --> 20:12.220
I don't even care.

20:12.220 --> 20:14.140
I don't care if it's a spoiler or not.

20:14.140 --> 20:15.140
Two words.

20:15.140 --> 20:16.140
Tomorrow perfume.

20:16.140 --> 20:17.140
That's it.

20:17.140 --> 20:19.940
Tomorrow perfume was an excellent choice for an unlock to the game.

20:19.940 --> 20:21.100
Yes, it was.

20:21.100 --> 20:24.980
I'm going to start off with a bitch, and it's my one bitch about Max 2 USA.

20:24.980 --> 20:29.260
Otherwise the game is fucking fabulous, but this is my bitch.

20:29.260 --> 20:33.740
Almost one out of every three songs has been in a USA release before, including like half

20:33.740 --> 20:34.740
the unlocks.

20:34.740 --> 20:39.220
Like when I unlocked Afronova, okay no, when I unlocked Put Your Faith In Me, I about threw

20:39.220 --> 20:40.620
a brick through the TV, okay?

20:40.620 --> 20:45.100
I was like, if Loki hadn't bought this brand new TV, I would have put a brick through it.

20:45.100 --> 20:47.100
Because I was just like, what the hell?

20:47.100 --> 20:48.100
Put Your Faith In Me?

20:48.100 --> 20:49.100
At least it wasn't a jazzy group.

20:49.100 --> 20:53.980
I mean, if you're going to repeat something, repeat a good song.

20:53.980 --> 20:59.260
my one bitch otherwise yeah I like the game but I just I felt a little cheated

20:59.260 --> 21:03.480
I was like couldn't they have just put another 2d x song in there like if they

21:03.480 --> 21:06.520
wanted to put something booty like if they had to have a booty song instead of

21:06.520 --> 21:11.120
put your faith in me how about my baby more game oh yes put in my baby mama

21:11.120 --> 21:15.960
because I'll tell you one of the coolest things one of the things I freaking love

21:15.960 --> 21:21.160
about max to USA is those fourth mix songs conga feeling dream a dream in the

21:21.160 --> 21:27.320
Navy, 3rd Mix, 4th Mix, whatever. Those songs have been completely reinvented. The fact

21:27.320 --> 21:36.320
that they're in 60 frames a minute, background videos, fucking rule. I'm almost a little

21:36.320 --> 21:39.960
disappointed that there weren't more of them. Like I was a little surprised that Heaven

21:39.960 --> 21:44.000
didn't have its video. I thought there would be a video for that. Okay, so they probably

21:44.000 --> 21:47.780
had licensing issue problems. Fine. So, you know, give it to them, fine. They probably

21:47.780 --> 21:57.940
had to pay a lot more to license the videos. The Days Go By video is pretty cool. I'll

21:57.940 --> 22:03.140
tell you what, favorite video. You know how many songs actually have music videos though?

22:03.140 --> 22:08.780
If you do the counting, six. I think it's only six. It's the two Captain Jack songs,

22:08.780 --> 22:22.020
Conga Feelin', Whistle Song, Love at First Sight, Days Go By, and Four Strings, oh maybe

22:22.020 --> 22:30.340
there was eight because that's seven I just named. Four Strings has a video that has the

22:30.340 --> 22:36.300
trains in it and the green wall. Nobody knew what video it was when you saw it. Oh yeah,

22:36.300 --> 22:38.300
You have to just look at the Four Strings video.

22:38.300 --> 22:40.300
The steps to that song are really good.

22:40.300 --> 22:42.300
You know how everybody thought?

22:42.300 --> 22:49.300
You remember when the early early pictures of Max 2 came out and they had the trains

22:49.300 --> 22:51.300
and everybody said it was Chemical Brothers Star Guitar?

22:51.300 --> 22:53.300
It was actually the Four Strings video.

22:53.300 --> 22:56.300
Yeah, whatever.

22:56.300 --> 22:59.300
I was done with that game in one hour.

22:59.300 --> 23:01.300
I was just like, eh, I'm over it.

23:01.300 --> 23:03.300
You know what though?

23:03.300 --> 23:06.540
We had like a working dance pad in here right now, I think I'd still be playing it every

23:06.540 --> 23:07.540
day for exercise.

23:07.540 --> 23:08.540
Oh yeah, doubles?

23:08.540 --> 23:09.540
Awesome.

23:09.540 --> 23:16.580
My ignition pad, mine, that I got as an alimony payment.

23:16.580 --> 23:21.260
Yeah, so we've heard about that pad so many times already, we don't need to hear it again.

23:21.260 --> 23:22.820
You're right, we don't need to hear it again.

23:22.820 --> 23:27.940
But just the random old non-stop is keeping me playing it every day.

23:27.940 --> 23:30.500
You know what, if I had a dance pad to play it on, not just a controller, I'd be playing

23:30.500 --> 23:31.500
it every day too.

23:31.500 --> 23:35.360
You know what's weird is I think between this, and I'm going to get into this later, between

23:35.360 --> 23:41.920
this and RVGL's recent turnaround, I'm like totally into DDR again, it's scary.

23:41.920 --> 23:47.160
Except for the whole wobbly pad thing on Xtreme and RVGL, I played one game on it and I was

23:47.160 --> 23:50.680
like E. Other comments on Max2?

23:50.680 --> 23:52.720
You haven't been able to play it yet, Aaron, right?

23:52.720 --> 23:56.640
Hopefully during a break we'll be able to sneak it on so you can see it.

23:56.640 --> 23:57.640
Favorite video?

23:57.640 --> 23:58.640
Puppy.

23:58.640 --> 23:59.640
Favorite video?

23:59.640 --> 24:07.760
Let's see, I have to go with in the Navy video.

24:07.760 --> 24:14.160
I would say it's a tie, because I love Conga Feelin, I love Vivian, she's a fat Shakira,

24:14.160 --> 24:15.700
I love her.

24:15.700 --> 24:20.620
But Dream of Dream is so cool too, like the flying car and the lucky rocks.

24:20.620 --> 24:23.200
There's a flying car in the Dream of Dream video, it's awesome.

24:23.200 --> 24:27.120
I think I have to say Conga Feelin though, because like, they change, one thing you may

24:27.120 --> 24:30.800
not know if you haven't picked up Max 2 USA yet, they changed all the backgrounds for

24:30.800 --> 24:34.720
the 4th mix and before songs that have videos. So Conga Feelin, Dream of Dream, they all

24:34.720 --> 24:38.800
have new backgrounds that are stills from the music video. The Dream of Dream background

24:38.800 --> 24:45.560
is the best DVR background ever. But the Conga Feelin video is like this shot of Vivian and

24:45.560 --> 24:50.240
she has like her mouth open and her eyes squinty. It looks scary. I think it's a throwback to

24:50.240 --> 24:54.760
the original 4th Plus video, which was the girl with her mouth open, but the way they

24:54.760 --> 25:00.900
got the freeze-frame in the video, it looks like a cum shot.

25:00.900 --> 25:04.220
Like hug a feeling, because Vivian's got her mouth open, she's like, oh yeah baby!

25:04.220 --> 25:07.060
What about Captain Jack's background for Dream of a Dream?

25:07.060 --> 25:08.060
Dream of a Dream was awesome.

25:08.060 --> 25:19.540
He's just like, scary monster man, shittiest background, shittiest new background, beloved

25:19.540 --> 25:25.020
first sight video scary I would say I don't want to watch the whole thing

25:25.020 --> 25:29.620
this background is days go by I'm sorry I don't because that shot of the guys in

25:29.620 --> 25:33.340
the car they like keep showing that in the video they're actually it's because

25:33.340 --> 25:37.980
they're the singers well you can't really see the see it very much because

25:37.980 --> 25:42.840
the videos are so low-res but they're actually singing the song in the

25:42.840 --> 25:47.780
background well it's not I don't like that that's a video though that I need

25:47.780 --> 25:53.600
to get the whole thing of the because yeah that's the worst video but no but

25:53.600 --> 25:57.380
no for days go by though the whole video I really want to see it because it's

25:57.380 --> 26:00.460
supposed to be like I actually have a whole story to it why is it oh yeah it

26:00.460 --> 26:05.820
has subtitles to which somehow I think they totally edited the max to USA one

26:05.820 --> 26:09.060
because it has no subtitles so I think they totally picked pick and chose

26:09.060 --> 26:11.860
different clips because if you notice if you watch the Kylie video they had to

26:11.860 --> 26:14.860
edit that too because they have to edit it to go with the edited song I think

26:14.860 --> 26:20.860
I think it also turned into widescreen on the Max 2 background video.

26:20.860 --> 26:22.860
I didn't pay that close attention, unfortunately.

26:22.860 --> 26:28.860
I thought they changed the ratio so that it wouldn't show where the actual subtitles would have been.

26:28.860 --> 26:30.860
Maybe. They may have done something like that.

26:30.860 --> 26:37.860
If you want to comment on Max 2 USA with the rest of our listeners, www.calibomani.com, click on Orange Lounge and click on Chat.

26:37.860 --> 26:39.860
We'll be playing Max 2 USA MP3s throughout the evening.

26:39.860 --> 26:43.860
We also have the three brand new songs in DDR.

26:43.860 --> 26:46.660
my next question what you guys think of the brand brand new songs have never

26:46.660 --> 26:50.300
been in DDR I'm sorry that have never been in the Konami originals have not

26:50.300 --> 26:56.440
been in any game yet like forever sunshine and all that stuff fun forever

26:56.440 --> 27:02.500
sunshine came out of my ass equally brown goo that's what that song was we

27:02.500 --> 27:06.860
found a singer that sings worse than Paul Atari we didn't think it was

27:06.860 --> 27:15.060
I love you has the chick from let them move singing and it's actually a really damn good

27:15.060 --> 27:16.060
song.

27:16.060 --> 27:17.060
Yeah it is.

27:17.060 --> 27:21.500
The first time I heard it it was like eh but it started to grow on me.

27:21.500 --> 27:26.380
Forever sunshine is awful it has miss piggy singing it is what we were saying on wednesday

27:26.380 --> 27:27.380
you know.

27:27.380 --> 27:41.340
I wish they would have taken that one new song from Lesson Mode and actually put that

27:41.340 --> 27:42.340
into the game.

27:42.340 --> 27:45.740
The biggest letdown is not having that song in the game as a playable song.

27:45.740 --> 27:47.260
That's one we didn't rip.

27:47.260 --> 27:48.260
We should have played...

27:48.260 --> 27:49.740
Oh, that's one thing we got to do.

27:49.740 --> 27:55.880
I actually just played through that whole section of Lesson Mode just so I could play

28:25.880 --> 28:30.780
busy stuff. They all do their own dance so it's really stupid looking.

28:30.780 --> 28:33.740
Sometimes they'll do the same dance with the same type.

28:33.740 --> 28:37.560
Did you like the dancers overall, Jamie? Did you think it was a good feature?

28:37.560 --> 28:39.760
They were all cleaned up and cel shaded. They were really nice.

28:39.760 --> 28:43.920
The characters looked gorgeous. Cel shaded rage is fucking pimp.

28:43.920 --> 28:46.400
Do you think they totally stole that idea from StepMania though?

28:46.400 --> 28:50.500
They could have, but StepMania isn't cel shaded.

28:50.500 --> 28:54.240
You know what? They did it better in the USDR I gotta say. But I'll tell you what, the best

28:54.240 --> 28:58.240
The best thing about those characters is when you get extra stage playing Max and the Light.

28:58.240 --> 29:00.240
Oh my God, there's seizures!

29:00.240 --> 29:02.240
It's funny. It's so funny.

29:02.240 --> 29:06.240
It's like, hello, seizures. It's crazy.

29:06.240 --> 29:11.240
23rd Magus says in the chatroom, the best song in the game was the Midnight Blaze remix in the menus.

29:11.240 --> 29:15.240
That was an awesome mix. Again, kind of a disappointment that that wasn't there.

29:15.240 --> 29:16.240
Was that the same one from Beaver?

29:16.240 --> 29:18.240
I'm not sure, I guess.

29:18.240 --> 29:20.240
I hate System SF.

29:20.240 --> 29:22.240
I know you hate System SF, but we'll get into it later.

29:22.240 --> 29:27.320
It was actually kind of hard, and it was fun, and I liked it.

29:27.320 --> 29:29.160
We're going to have that next week.

29:29.160 --> 29:33.380
Next week, we're going to have the US v. Rare 2, Jamie has it, and she's going to bring

29:33.380 --> 29:36.960
it next week for us.

29:36.960 --> 29:40.320
After the show tonight, by the way, Night Style, original soundtrack, we're going to

29:40.320 --> 29:43.440
play it for you guys, because we've been playing bits and pieces for you guys throughout the

29:43.440 --> 29:45.820
week, but I know most of you guys listen to tonight's show, so...

29:45.820 --> 29:49.220
Didn't it go up on MGZ?

29:49.220 --> 29:50.220
The first disc?

29:50.220 --> 29:51.900
I don't know, we had the whole thing.

29:51.900 --> 29:54.900
We got it through a different source.

29:54.900 --> 29:57.980
One of our studio regulars got it for us.

29:57.980 --> 29:58.980
It's okay.

29:58.980 --> 29:59.980
Yep.

29:59.980 --> 30:02.300
I only need to get a copy then.

30:02.300 --> 30:05.140
I can't copy tonight, but I can get it for you during the week.

30:05.140 --> 30:06.140
Anyway.

30:06.140 --> 30:07.140
Anybody else want a microphone now?

30:07.140 --> 30:08.140
Yeah.

30:08.140 --> 30:09.140
Anyone else want to comment on Max 2?

30:09.140 --> 30:10.140
Loki?

30:10.140 --> 30:11.140
I've never played it.

30:11.140 --> 30:12.140
Bradley?

30:12.140 --> 30:13.140
I know you haven't played it.

30:13.140 --> 30:14.140
Bradley, you have anything you want to say on Max 2?

30:14.140 --> 30:15.140
I know you got a little bit out on Wednesday, but...

30:15.140 --> 30:16.140
Jamie!

30:16.140 --> 30:17.780
What do you have to say about Max 2?

30:17.780 --> 30:18.780
She's cooking.

30:18.780 --> 30:19.780
She's cooking.

30:19.780 --> 30:20.780
So I'm like stuck with a microphone?

30:20.780 --> 30:21.780
Yeah.

30:21.780 --> 30:23.780
What else is there to talk about with Max 2?

30:23.780 --> 30:30.780
I'm actually glad they took out OE's and replaced them with non-stops, because non-stops are much better.

30:30.780 --> 30:32.780
Jason Enos is brilliant.

30:32.780 --> 30:33.780
Yes, thank you.

30:33.780 --> 30:35.780
Thank you, that's why I forgot.

30:35.780 --> 30:40.780
The information screen is like the best part of the unlocks, completely.

30:40.780 --> 30:42.780
It is so hilarious.

30:42.780 --> 30:46.780
Supposedly, the rumor is Jason Enos wrote all those himself.

30:46.780 --> 30:50.780
I mean, we know he did for Max, so we kind of assume he did for Max 2.

30:50.780 --> 30:55.780
Who knows, but those things were the funniest damn things I've ever read.

30:55.780 --> 30:57.780
You know what, and there's one for every damn song in the game.

30:57.780 --> 31:06.780
Yes, and they're funny. Some of them are kind of generic, but some of the ones that use the worst puns ever are so great.

31:06.780 --> 31:14.780
Honestly, that was part of the unlocking for me, was just getting to do the bad puns.

31:14.780 --> 31:16.780
Yes, Jamie?

31:16.780 --> 31:21.020
I didn't get a chance to check it out because I've been kind of busy but I'm going to be

31:21.020 --> 31:25.260
using the workout mode in the game and it looks like it was tweaked a little bit.

31:25.260 --> 31:26.980
Have you looked at workout mode?

31:26.980 --> 31:27.980
They did change it.

31:27.980 --> 31:28.980
They did.

31:28.980 --> 31:29.980
I was not able to find non-stops though.

31:29.980 --> 31:33.500
I heard a rumor that non-stops were in workout mode.

31:33.500 --> 31:35.500
We couldn't find them.

31:35.500 --> 31:38.980
Oh, maybe that's what we did wrong.

31:38.980 --> 31:43.000
Well, I'll tell you what though, they totally changed the interface.

31:43.000 --> 31:45.900
The interface in workout mode looks better than in the end game.

31:45.900 --> 31:50.460
it has like the stars and the flashing red background yeah it's pretty it's

31:50.460 --> 31:56.420
very pretty I know it's pretty it's got the little spiral swirly thing and it

31:56.420 --> 32:00.460
makes it look cool I kind of like how max to USA feels a little bit like a

32:00.460 --> 32:03.700
hybrid of max to an extreme like with all the extreme videos being in there

32:03.700 --> 32:08.100
and stuff but what's interesting is that when October 9th that we're only like

32:08.100 --> 32:11.900
two weeks away from it we're gonna be seeing the Japanese version of extreme

32:11.900 --> 32:14.380
and we here at orange on radio course will be getting that we're gonna do

32:14.380 --> 32:17.140
Another big promo for that one.

32:17.140 --> 32:20.580
Yeah, but the problem is, we don't know what day we're going to get it.

32:20.580 --> 32:22.620
You may not get it for like three weeks after it's released.

32:22.620 --> 32:25.820
Well, we're hoping we're going to get it within days of its release.

32:25.820 --> 32:33.220
It could be, it'll be like a Wednesday or a Thursday, we think.

32:33.220 --> 32:34.180
So.

32:34.180 --> 32:35.540
Which means it'd be in the middle of the week,

32:35.540 --> 32:37.220
which means I can't come out and do.

32:37.220 --> 32:38.700
Which is fine, because Wednesday and

32:38.700 --> 32:40.900
Thursday is kind of open on Orange on Twitter right now,

32:40.900 --> 32:46.220
with Livewar being on hiatus and everything so yeah look you'll get into

32:46.220 --> 32:52.740
that later why Livewar is on her hiatus for the well um DR extreme Japan it's

32:52.740 --> 32:57.420
kind of like wow it's gonna be interesting because max to USA for once

32:57.420 --> 33:01.220
it's like it's taken a lot of the good things before the Japanese can do it

33:01.220 --> 33:06.460
yeah we actually beat them two things and there's self-shading characters the

33:06.460 --> 33:07.460
Some of the songs.

33:07.460 --> 33:08.460
Background movies.

33:08.460 --> 33:09.460
Some of the songs.

33:09.460 --> 33:10.460
Background movies.

33:10.460 --> 33:14.620
Although if you heard this, this is kind of news that came out this week, DDR Party Edition,

33:14.620 --> 33:16.500
the one that's going to come out after Extreme.

33:16.500 --> 33:20.060
I don't know if it's the end of the year or first quarter next year, but it's kind of

33:20.060 --> 33:24.380
going to be a best hits too, basically, but it's going to use music videos.

33:24.380 --> 33:25.380
And it's been confirmed-

33:25.380 --> 33:26.380
That could be interesting.

33:26.380 --> 33:28.620
It's been confirmed that Conga Field is going to have its videos, so who knows what other

33:28.620 --> 33:29.620
videos we're going to get now.

33:29.620 --> 33:32.380
Probably the same four we have in Max 2 USA.

33:32.380 --> 33:35.820
Could we get Butterfly's video, because Butterfly has been confirmed in the mix.

33:35.820 --> 33:47.820
Okay. No. Just no. That's frightening. And whose phone is ringing? I hear a tone.

33:47.820 --> 34:01.820
Bad song in that mix. Spice Girls Wannabe is going to be in DDR Party. It has two new songs. One of them is a B4U song and the other one is Spice Girls.

34:01.820 --> 34:05.820
Because it's in the new euro, it's in the new euro game.

34:05.820 --> 34:11.820
Fuck the Spice Girls! Fuck them! Fuck their music!

34:14.820 --> 34:17.820
Why do they have to prolong their song's life?

34:17.820 --> 34:24.820
And of course, people are spreading rumors that the Korean songs will finally make their debut in Party. I doubt it too.

34:24.820 --> 34:29.820
Never gonna happen, stop wanting those old pieces of shit songs.

34:29.820 --> 34:30.820
They suck.

34:30.820 --> 34:35.740
If they were so good, they would have brought them back.

34:35.740 --> 34:36.740
But they suck.

34:36.740 --> 34:41.180
It was a Korean game in the first place.

34:41.180 --> 34:42.180
Get over it.

34:42.180 --> 34:43.180
Face sucks.

34:43.180 --> 34:46.740
I will give you that, but back row.

34:46.740 --> 34:48.540
What's the one wherever you go?

34:48.540 --> 34:49.540
What's the slow one?

34:49.540 --> 34:50.540
Bueul.

34:50.540 --> 34:51.540
Bueul.

34:51.540 --> 34:52.540
Bueul sucks.

34:52.540 --> 34:57.180
But like, wah, bakwah, song-suk, mask time.

34:57.180 --> 34:59.280
Yes.

34:59.280 --> 35:05.080
One of the Sacramento regulars had a routine to be a little it was pretty cool.

35:05.080 --> 35:12.160
Anyway Holly is posting parody lyrics to Wannabe.

35:12.160 --> 35:15.160
If you want to be my butter, you got to spread on my bread.

35:15.160 --> 35:16.160
That's cute.

35:16.160 --> 35:17.160
That's very cute.

35:17.160 --> 35:18.160
Yeah.

35:18.160 --> 35:22.880
Tell me, tell me, have like the funnest trick double steps ever.

35:22.880 --> 35:24.160
I don't do trick doubles.

35:24.160 --> 35:25.160
Thank you.

35:25.160 --> 35:26.160
Star Yan.

35:26.160 --> 35:28.160
That's the worst Double Step.

35:48.160 --> 35:49.160
Nope.

35:49.160 --> 35:50.160
I don't think it'll happen.

35:50.160 --> 35:55.160
We need bass solo songs.

35:55.160 --> 36:00.160
So, Extreme will be out in a few weeks and there's a couple new tracks in Extreme. It'll be fun.

36:00.160 --> 36:03.160
Like, A Stupid Barber.

36:03.160 --> 36:05.160
A Stupid Barber has been confirmed.

36:05.160 --> 36:06.160
What the hell is that song?

36:06.160 --> 36:13.160
It's by Soda. It's by the same one who did one of the songs.

36:13.160 --> 36:14.160
Do It Right.

36:14.160 --> 36:15.160
Is it Do It Right?

36:15.160 --> 36:16.160
Yeah.

36:16.160 --> 36:19.160
It's also one of the songs in Max 2 USA.

36:19.160 --> 36:28.720
It's one of the Hidden Max 2 USA songs too. I just can't think of the name. I'm looking

36:28.720 --> 36:32.660
it up right now. I Need You. That one. I Need You was by him too.

36:32.660 --> 36:42.700
Was it piano in the background? Oh. Oh. That one was, right, whatever.

36:42.700 --> 36:47.700
So, um, okay, so what's this, what's this that you're going to play for us, Logie?

36:47.700 --> 36:51.940
This is the track that was in the lesson mode in X2.

36:51.940 --> 36:58.940
I think, I heard it, I heard it, it called Overloaded, alright let's hear it.

38:21.940 --> 38:44.220
All right, that is Lesson Two, we're calling it for now, or it might be Overloaded, because

38:44.220 --> 38:45.540
that's the one lyric in it.

38:45.540 --> 38:50.140
But that is Lesson Two in Max2USAC, if you want to listen to it, that's the song you

38:50.140 --> 38:51.140
have.

38:51.140 --> 38:57.620
and what if that's a stupid barber that would be no just no I doubt it but that

38:57.620 --> 39:02.260
would be cool well here's the other thing though it's one of the things we

39:02.260 --> 39:08.380
can look at since pretty much you can guarantee extreme the party mix max to

39:08.380 --> 39:14.380
USA and dancing stage fever are whatever their one is gonna be called now that

39:14.380 --> 39:18.220
I don't know if it's fever or not but anyways they're all sharing the same

39:18.220 --> 39:22.960
song list that was in max 2 so you pretty much eliminate all the songs

39:22.960 --> 39:26.080
have been confirmed for the other games and you're left with what's an extreme

39:26.080 --> 39:31.720
which one of them is max period probably another max max period the problem is is

39:31.720 --> 39:36.040
if that appears in DDR extreme it's going to be pretty much guaranteeing

39:36.040 --> 39:41.920
that that's going to be DDR extreme was the last arcade version because they

39:41.920 --> 39:48.800
never released maxes on the home versions at all so that'd be my guess I

39:48.800 --> 39:52.600
I'm gonna go out on a limb here and I know Loki's gonna yell at me for it but

39:52.600 --> 39:55.960
I think max period is a red herring I don't think it means anything I think

39:55.960 --> 40:00.880
it'll be it'll be nothing I don't think it's gonna be a song but I would love to

40:00.880 --> 40:08.500
be proven wrong mine didn't break I didn't I don't even remember when it

40:08.500 --> 40:20.700
broke. Maybe that song was max period. Oh my gods. Okay, we're going to take a break.

40:20.700 --> 40:25.260
We're going to play some more Max2USA stuff. When we come back, we're going to finish up

40:25.260 --> 40:30.260
any talk on Max2USA. We're going to talk a bit about some other games and some other

40:30.260 --> 40:34.940
arcades in town. We're going to talk about 2DX as well when we come back. After this

40:34.940 --> 40:39.380
a group of Max 2 USA MP3s are going to hear in this break start off with Days Go By. And

40:39.380 --> 40:41.500
you're going to hear Forever Sunshine in this break, too.

40:41.500 --> 40:42.500
No!

40:42.500 --> 40:47.860
No! God, no. It's only a minute and 28 seconds, but I feel an obligation to our listeners

40:47.860 --> 40:51.740
who haven't been able to hear it yet. They can say they've heard it, so here it is.

40:51.740 --> 40:53.580
Do you really want to scare the crap out of them?

40:53.580 --> 40:58.100
That's okay, because after that we get one of the coolest 70s songs ever, Get Down Tonight.

40:58.100 --> 40:59.180
Do a little dance.

40:59.180 --> 41:03.780
You know what? You know what? People don't need to buy laxatives anymore, because all

41:03.780 --> 41:07.780
All we have to do is listen to that Sunshine song, and it will make them poop.

41:07.780 --> 41:13.780
And if we have the Sunshine Creep, I love you.

41:13.780 --> 41:18.780
Listen Frog, now is that song worse than Let Them Move?

41:18.780 --> 41:20.780
Is that song worse than Let Them Move?

41:20.780 --> 41:23.780
We will find out, we will find out after the break.

41:23.780 --> 41:25.780
We should make the chat room vote.

41:53.780 --> 42:00.780
Feelin' at my fingertips With an atmosphere

42:02.780 --> 42:04.780
You

42:05.780 --> 42:08.780
Leave me when I'm at first

42:09.780 --> 42:15.780
Feelin' as if I've been a ghost With a cold within

42:15.780 --> 42:22.780
Days go by and still I think of you.

42:22.780 --> 42:30.780
Days when I couldn't live my life without you.

42:30.780 --> 42:34.780
Without you.

42:34.780 --> 42:42.780
Without you.

42:42.780 --> 42:49.780
When your day is bright and sun shines all through the night

43:12.780 --> 43:16.780
That's when, when you know you did

43:16.780 --> 43:21.780
Then you did it by design

43:21.780 --> 43:27.780
Sitting on the beach and sand tickles your feet

43:27.780 --> 43:31.780
That's when, when you know you did

43:31.780 --> 43:37.780
Then you did it by forever sunshine

43:37.780 --> 43:40.780
Like this sport of sunshine

43:41.780 --> 43:44.780
Kind of sport of sunshine

43:45.780 --> 43:48.780
Free of all the sunshine

43:49.780 --> 43:51.780
And you, I'll be kind

43:52.780 --> 43:56.780
If you can meet in the sunshine

43:56.780 --> 44:00.780
Like this sport of sunshine

44:00.780 --> 44:04.780
Free of sport of sunshine

44:04.780 --> 44:12.220
We won't pass

44:12.640 --> 44:19.840
The chance

44:30.720 --> 44:32.120
Take back

44:32.120 --> 44:38.120
Let's get together, on your heart, me and you

44:38.120 --> 44:43.120
And do the things, oh, do the things

44:43.120 --> 44:47.120
That we like to do, oh

44:47.120 --> 44:51.120
Do a little dance, make a little love

44:51.120 --> 44:55.120
Get down tonight, get down tonight

44:55.120 --> 45:00.120
Baby babe, I need you

45:00.120 --> 45:03.120
Same place, same time

45:04.120 --> 45:08.120
Where we can all get together

45:08.120 --> 45:12.120
And ease up our mind

45:12.120 --> 45:14.120
Oh, do a little dance

45:14.120 --> 45:16.120
Make a little love

45:16.120 --> 45:18.120
Get down tonight

45:18.120 --> 45:21.120
Get down tonight, baby

45:21.120 --> 45:27.120
Get down, get down, get down, get down, get down tonight, baby

45:27.120 --> 45:48.600
Get down, get down, get down, get down, get down tonight baby

45:48.600 --> 46:06.600
Welcome back boys and girls to Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 62, playing Max 2 USA

46:06.600 --> 46:07.960
MP3s all night tonight.

46:07.960 --> 46:13.600
In that break you heard Dirty Vegas stays go by, Shell Y with Forever Sunshine, and

46:13.600 --> 46:17.000
Miss Piggy, and Casey and the Sunshine Band with Get Down Tonight.

46:17.000 --> 46:22.000
I have to make a comment on the chatroom for your response to Biohazard.

46:22.000 --> 46:28.000
Don't diss Casey and the Sunshine Band.

46:28.000 --> 46:32.400
That is the best fucking song ever.

46:32.400 --> 46:34.200
You know what, though?

46:34.200 --> 46:36.720
I do have to agree with half of what he says.

46:36.720 --> 46:41.160
I think Let's Groove is funner to dance to, and funner is a word, yes.

46:41.160 --> 46:42.160
Gotcha though?

46:42.160 --> 46:43.160
Can't stand it.

46:43.160 --> 46:45.360
Can't stand Gotcha.

46:45.360 --> 46:48.600
I cannot stand dancing that song.

46:48.600 --> 46:49.640
Okay, just still.

46:49.640 --> 46:50.480
Before we went to the break-

46:50.480 --> 46:51.720
Casey and the Sunshine Band is better.

46:51.720 --> 46:52.560
Casey and the Sunshine Band rules.

46:52.560 --> 46:53.380
Before we went to the break,

46:53.380 --> 46:54.680
we said we were gonna settle a debate.

46:54.680 --> 46:56.520
Which song is worse,

46:56.520 --> 46:58.880
Forever Sunshine or Let Them Move?

46:58.880 --> 46:59.960
The chat room has voted

46:59.960 --> 47:01.520
and I will reveal what they have voted,

47:01.520 --> 47:02.480
which one is worse,

47:02.480 --> 47:05.240
but I just wanna hear what you guys think and why.

47:05.240 --> 47:06.560
Erin, we haven't heard much from you tonight.

47:06.560 --> 47:09.800
Which song's worse, Let Them Move or Forever Sunshine?

47:09.800 --> 47:11.600
I guess you guys should know my opinion on this.

47:11.600 --> 47:16.240
i did freestyle

47:16.240 --> 47:20.160
well i did i did freestyle to let them move

47:20.160 --> 47:23.200
and we all know how that turned out so

47:23.200 --> 47:26.560
i guess i could say forever sunshine is kind of weird

47:26.560 --> 47:28.820
but is it worse?

47:28.820 --> 47:30.720
okay so aaron says

47:30.720 --> 47:32.800
forever sunshine is a little worse

47:32.800 --> 47:35.120
just a little though

47:35.120 --> 47:36.340
uh...

47:36.340 --> 47:37.160
puppy

47:37.160 --> 47:39.320
which one's worse and why?

47:39.320 --> 47:49.320
Front of Sunshine is because I can stand Let Them Move if I turn the volume down a little bit, but no, this song is just ew.

47:50.320 --> 47:53.320
Jamie, which is worse and why?

47:53.320 --> 48:00.320
After dealing with Let Them Move for three and a half, nearly four years, uh-uh, Let Them Move is still the worst.

48:00.320 --> 48:08.320
Because, see, that Miss Piggy song, the only thing I don't like about it is her voice. I like the tune, I like the bouncy happy happy.

48:08.320 --> 48:11.440
But let them move, there's nothing redeemable about it.

48:11.440 --> 48:15.780
That woman and this piggy need to be shut up, need to be dragged out in the street and

48:15.780 --> 48:20.200
shot repeatedly in various orifices starting with their mouth.

48:20.200 --> 48:23.800
Bradley, which song is worse and why?

48:23.800 --> 48:25.880
Let Them Move is worse.

48:25.880 --> 48:30.160
This woman in this song can actually sing alright, even if she sings weird.

48:30.160 --> 48:38.160
But let them move if she just screeches and makes it much worse.

48:38.160 --> 48:40.760
So that's it.

48:40.760 --> 48:42.320
Loki, which song is worse and why?

48:42.320 --> 48:45.160
I think they need to do Let Them Move Ska, which would be

48:45.160 --> 48:46.400
pretty cool.

48:46.400 --> 48:49.040
Da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da.

48:49.040 --> 48:52.840
Let them move, sweet, sweet baby.

48:52.840 --> 48:53.840
They could totally do it.

48:53.840 --> 48:59.800
They get like, I don't know, get some ska band to do it.

48:59.800 --> 49:07.200
I mean, there's plenty of guitar, or was it Mr. Brian and

49:07.200 --> 49:11.800
the final ban. Get him to do that. Oh yeah, we should have put Crash in there too, but

49:11.800 --> 49:19.800
that's alright. That wasn't an option. So, what's your answer? I dislike them equally.

49:19.800 --> 49:28.560
Honestly, I hate Forever Sunshine because it's happy and I don't like happy. It's happy

49:28.560 --> 49:35.260
like Poppy. Like, look, the sun is smiling, the clouds are smiling, the little furry animals

49:35.260 --> 49:43.540
are smiling everybody is smiling happy happy to scream scream badly yeah I just

49:43.540 --> 49:50.300
all right me personally as much as now I can impersonate Muppets to both of them

49:50.300 --> 49:52.900
because I can do miss piggy with forever sunshine but would let them move I can

49:52.900 --> 50:04.940
also do but let them move is by far worse

50:04.940 --> 50:08.860
I love imitating this piggy more than I do almost, so Forever Sunshine is way worse.

50:08.860 --> 50:10.500
I'm sorry, I mean Let Them Move is way worse.

50:10.500 --> 50:11.740
Forever Sunshine is better.

50:11.740 --> 50:16.380
I actually somewhat enjoy Forever Sunshine in a campy musical sort of way.

50:16.380 --> 50:18.660
All right, so I think it was even.

50:18.660 --> 50:22.940
We had Loki, Bradley, and me said Let Them Move, no, because Jamie also said Let Them

50:22.940 --> 50:23.940
Move is worse.

50:23.940 --> 50:26.580
So it was four, and then you two say Forever Sunshine.

50:26.580 --> 50:28.180
What do you guys think the chat room said?

50:28.180 --> 50:30.080
Let Them Move.

50:30.080 --> 50:36.000
By an overwhelming majority, well mostly overwhelming, the chat room says Let Them Move is the worst

50:36.000 --> 50:37.000
song.

50:37.000 --> 50:38.000
So, there you go.

50:38.000 --> 50:39.000
That's the way you guys voted.

50:39.000 --> 50:42.720
I don't think it matters because it's still banned from the station.

50:42.720 --> 50:44.000
Let Them Move is banned from the station.

50:44.000 --> 50:45.320
I don't know about Forever Sunshine though.

50:45.320 --> 50:47.000
I don't know if I put that in or not today.

50:47.000 --> 50:49.320
I put a bunch of new Max2USA MP3s in today.

50:49.320 --> 50:51.880
I don't know if Forever Sunshine is one of them or not.

50:51.880 --> 50:54.040
Thank you, Violent Hyper Burp Girl.

50:54.040 --> 50:55.040
That was impressive.

50:55.040 --> 50:58.960
Hey, it was a double.

50:58.960 --> 51:03.540
Let's get into 2DX News and speaking of bad songs, you know the 9th Style soundtrack came

51:03.540 --> 51:09.080
out like just a week ago pretty much and I have to admit something, and this is hard,

51:09.080 --> 51:15.520
this is painful, I need to sit down for this, and you know the last time I sat down to admit

51:15.520 --> 51:20.420
something I was admitting that I like Paul Atari's version of Dive, so you know that

51:20.420 --> 51:23.100
this is bad, okay?

51:23.100 --> 51:27.840
There was a song that I was somewhat surprised to see on the 9th Style soundtrack and I forgot

51:27.840 --> 51:32.680
that this song was in night style, but when I was listening to this song, I realized that

51:32.680 --> 51:40.860
in the context of 2DX, I actually kind of liked this song. And that song, that song

51:40.860 --> 51:54.160
is, don't say it, don't say it, stop, kind of like bag. You fag. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

51:54.160 --> 52:04.160
I like bag. I apologize to my mommy. Jamie likes bag too? It'll only be good when it

52:04.160 --> 52:11.840
gets remixed by 2MB. Where the hell has 2MB been? Seriously? He's just like, yeah. That

52:11.840 --> 52:18.760
personality, duh. Okay, where has 2MB been? I mean, seriously, he's just like, after 5th

52:18.760 --> 52:23.300
I quit you know me to get to and be here to take all the shitty sauce and

52:23.800 --> 52:31.100
Naoki the other personality keeps making and remit no wait to MB is not Naoki. I thought it was no

52:31.360 --> 52:33.360
It's you won the hour

52:34.040 --> 52:36.040
You tricked me

52:37.240 --> 52:43.300
How dare I yeah, we need to get him back to like this I absolutely agree with Brack 2000

52:43.300 --> 52:48.440
He says bag is bad for DDR. That's why I hated bag before it is an acid song to dance

52:48.440 --> 52:50.340
Bag should have been in Para Para.

52:50.340 --> 52:51.640
It was not fun at all.

52:51.640 --> 52:56.060
But Bag in 2DX would actually be kind of fun.

52:56.060 --> 52:59.280
I haven't played it in 2DX yet, but I think I'd actually enjoy it.

52:59.280 --> 53:03.320
So I found that on the Night Style OST, I actually enjoyed Bag.

53:03.320 --> 53:08.000
Sorry, Loki, it's the truth.

53:08.000 --> 53:10.640
And I believe in telling the truth on this show.

53:10.640 --> 53:11.640
Whatever.

53:11.640 --> 53:14.320
Also, on the Night Style soundtrack, there's some great stuff.

53:14.320 --> 53:16.200
A long version of Golden Horn.

53:16.200 --> 53:17.200
Awesome.

53:17.200 --> 53:21.160
version of the end of my spiritually and that's not a typo it's not spirituality

53:21.160 --> 53:25.040
it's the end of my spiritually if you listen to the lyrics it's great and yes

53:25.040 --> 53:29.520
I agree with I agree in the chat room somebody I scroll off the screen but

53:29.520 --> 53:34.800
logic board is awesome I love that song so and I and I agree with Jamie when she

53:34.800 --> 53:39.440
says more men with nice asses need to dance to bag and wear a kilt and would

53:39.440 --> 53:41.440
Would that be a military-style kilt?

53:41.440 --> 53:44.440
A full traditional.

53:44.440 --> 53:46.440
Okay.

53:46.440 --> 53:49.440
How does Sweden Savage sound?

53:49.440 --> 53:51.440
Pretty nice. Pretty good.

53:51.440 --> 53:54.440
That's the other athletics one, right?

53:54.440 --> 53:56.440
That's what I thought. Yeah, it's pretty good.

53:56.440 --> 54:03.440
It's interesting because when you hear things on the night-style OST, it sounds a lot different than those MP3s that were leaked before.

54:03.440 --> 54:06.440
Please don't go needs to be in DDR.

54:06.440 --> 54:10.120
Imagine how fun that would be on the little scratchy parts.

54:10.120 --> 54:15.320
Why can't they take songs from 2DX like Please Don't Go and put those into Max 2 USA instead

54:15.320 --> 54:16.320
of...

54:16.320 --> 54:18.860
Oh my God, VJ Army would kick so much ass in DDR.

54:18.860 --> 54:22.600
Why don't they take those instead and put them in instead of repeating fucking Put Your

54:22.600 --> 54:24.480
Faith In Me?

54:24.480 --> 54:29.480
And what I don't get is they're like in-house music, so why, I mean...

54:29.480 --> 54:30.480
I know.

54:30.480 --> 54:33.660
Pay your artists their little peanut or whatever.

54:33.660 --> 54:37.220
X broke it down on DDR Freak The Reasons Why and he was basically like, you know, you can

54:37.220 --> 54:40.620
have the repeats or you can have nothing or something like that. But I'm like, you know

54:40.620 --> 54:45.740
what, I'm sorry, I respect their decision or whatever but I don't agree with it. I think

54:45.740 --> 54:51.540
they could have taken more 2DX songs. I don't know what they're saving it for because as,

54:51.540 --> 54:54.980
you know, it's going to take another year before we see Max 3 or Xtreme in the U.S.,

54:54.980 --> 54:59.620
whatever it is, if we even see it at all, they may not do one.

54:59.620 --> 55:02.580
Why is it that like you can have... And by then we're going to have 9th and 10th

55:02.580 --> 55:10.340
No, no, no, why is it that you can have a person say, oh, I don't know, this guy goes

55:10.340 --> 55:14.900
by the name Healing Vision, or a guy that goes by the name Utterdude, or this guy,

55:14.900 --> 55:19.920
Matt, I forget his last name, why can they pump out really quality, and this is talking

55:19.920 --> 55:26.420
about better than home version, like sim files, of these songs, and we're not talking full

55:26.420 --> 55:31.380
sets, we're talking full difficulties for singles and doubles.

55:31.380 --> 55:37.920
like a few hours and it takes, you know, Konami of America people like half a year to pump

55:37.920 --> 55:43.540
out quality steps. I'm going to touch on something. Rumor is, it has not been confirmed that

55:43.540 --> 55:47.840
KOA actually did those steps. Rumor is that KOJ might have done quite a few of them, especially

55:47.840 --> 55:51.960
the things that are going to show up in Extreme later, like Sunshine and stuff. But I'm just

55:51.960 --> 55:55.160
saying, the same people who have done all the steps before are probably still doing

55:55.160 --> 56:00.600
them for DDR Max 2 USA. It has not been confirmed that KOA has been doing them in-house. I have

56:00.600 --> 56:10.600
You have to notice that a lot of the new original songs in Max 2 kind of get stuck with a lot of fucking freeze arrows, and you remember what happened in Max 1 with that.

56:10.600 --> 56:18.600
Hi, here's my suggestion. Dear Konami, when you're going to put out Max 3 or Xtreme or whatever the next thing is that's going to come out in the US, there better be something else!

56:18.600 --> 56:21.600
Please have an edit bank.

56:21.600 --> 56:25.600
Yeah, seriously, go with the databank just like last time.

56:25.600 --> 56:31.840
If this is what you need to link up to the old mixes, fuck this repeating, put your faith

56:31.840 --> 56:36.180
in me stuff just because the damn song was in economics, bring up an edit bank that has

56:36.180 --> 56:41.440
steps to songs like Dark Black Forest, Japan, things that were in earlier mixes, and there

56:41.440 --> 56:42.440
you go.

56:42.440 --> 56:44.960
Now people have a reason to get those old mixes because they want to see edit banking

56:44.960 --> 56:45.960
with them.

56:45.960 --> 56:50.080
And not only that, here's a few other things you can do.

56:50.080 --> 56:51.560
Put in challenge mode.

56:51.560 --> 57:05.800
You do not need a story mode because then we'd be going back to one of the worst Konami

57:05.800 --> 57:08.000
games ever, Dance Dance Dance.

57:08.000 --> 57:12.080
With a little stupid RPG mode in it, ugh that game sucked.

57:12.080 --> 57:13.080
Dance Dance Dance.

57:13.080 --> 57:17.000
Dance Dance Dance, this one started the Bimani thing.

57:17.000 --> 57:20.400
Dance Dance Dance started the Bimani thing, it did not begin with Beatmania, the style

57:20.400 --> 57:24.400
game with BeatMania, but the whole music game thing started with dance, dance, dance, and

57:24.400 --> 57:26.400
the game flows.

57:26.400 --> 57:30.440
Yeah, challenge mode for sure, but set up like drill mode, because in that way you can

57:30.440 --> 57:36.420
have drill mode as being both a training lesson mode thing and a challenge mode at the same

57:36.420 --> 57:41.280
time. And drill modes are fun, I mean it takes you a long time to go through and you can

57:41.280 --> 57:47.280
incorporate that. That and the unlocks. Don't make a song get unlocked after ten songs.

57:47.280 --> 57:53.840
Seriously, we play a full two sets of songs, five songs each, and we get an unlock.

57:53.840 --> 57:54.840
That's retarded.

57:54.840 --> 57:58.420
But what do you say to the people that disagree with you and say, you know what, fuck the

57:58.420 --> 57:59.920
unlocks, just have it all to begin with.

57:59.920 --> 58:01.600
Why do we even waste our time unlocking things?

58:01.600 --> 58:03.240
Just blow your load in the beginning.

58:03.240 --> 58:05.760
Because there's no point in playing the game then if you have no purpose to play the game.

58:05.760 --> 58:06.760
You have to have a goal.

58:06.760 --> 58:08.200
Well, what about playing the songs and dancing to them?

58:08.200 --> 58:09.200
That's what you do in DDR.

58:09.200 --> 58:10.200
You have to have a goal.

58:10.200 --> 58:11.200
It's going to get boring faster.

58:11.200 --> 58:13.200
What would you think now?

58:13.200 --> 58:16.560
I think, but we know this is never going to happen because the economy of America is not

58:16.560 --> 58:20.680
going to put out an arcade machine. But let's say KOJ does this. An F-Zero type

58:20.680 --> 58:23.240
unlock system where you have to go back and forth between the arcade and the home

58:23.240 --> 58:29.080
version to unlock things. It would be cool but it'll never work. Because they'll

58:29.080 --> 58:32.200
never make an arcade version.

58:34.240 --> 58:41.600
Anyway, we'd be interested in your suggestions as well for Max 3 USA or

58:41.600 --> 58:45.280
Xtreme, whatever it's called. Oh, it's just put it this way. www.kaliabomani.com

58:45.280 --> 58:47.880
Click on orange lounge and click on chat once I get the freaking

58:48.400 --> 58:51.520
Cabinet done in here and you see how I have the sim set up

58:51.520 --> 58:54.540
You know with all the songs and there's gonna be unlocks in there

58:55.160 --> 58:59.000
This is how the damn game should be like my home cabinet

58:59.120 --> 59:03.640
We're gonna have quality songs in there because I don't pay licensing rights to anyone

59:03.640 --> 59:08.640
You should make multiple machines and then sell them.

59:08.640 --> 59:13.640
You should go suck my cock.

59:13.640 --> 59:21.640
Okay, what time is it? We need to record the time so that...

59:21.640 --> 59:28.640
No styling has a great one. He says the unlock should be nude images of Konami's staff.

59:58.640 --> 01:00:02.960
routine mode where it's another set of steps but it goes with a dancing character on screen

01:00:02.960 --> 01:00:05.760
where you do what they do and it kind of goes with that.

01:00:05.760 --> 01:00:08.240
So like a learn how to freestyle like Mel B.

01:00:08.240 --> 01:00:15.680
No, no, see the problem with that is that now you're going to have a bunch of little

01:00:15.680 --> 01:00:19.880
uncharted teeny bopper idiots freestyling exactly the same routine and that's really

01:00:19.880 --> 01:00:20.880
bad.

01:00:20.880 --> 01:00:26.000
As opposed to a bunch of stupid Asians para-para-ing, I mean seriously.

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.000
Her is dead, okay?

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:33.000
It was cool until they made the videos and put it on the machine.

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:40.000
I would be fine with Konami doing a learn how to freestyle like us thing as long as,

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:43.000
and I preface this with a disclaimer, views and opinions expressed by me do not express

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:51.000
those words on video, as long as it's not 8-Ball.

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:52.000
I can't make a comment.

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:54.000
I cannot make a comment.

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:57.700
we'll take your silence as your comment

01:00:57.700 --> 01:01:00.080
well i still have stuff to say about that

01:01:00.080 --> 01:01:01.960
idea for freestyling i mean

01:01:01.960 --> 01:01:03.200
then they're all gonna

01:01:03.200 --> 01:01:07.680
there's no there's no uniqueness to the freestyling where everyone's just gonna base their routines off what it

01:01:07.680 --> 01:01:08.360
looks like

01:01:08.360 --> 01:01:09.240
you know what they see on the screen

01:01:09.240 --> 01:01:12.540
oh yeah you're right that would be a fucking nightmare because every routine you'd see in the

01:01:12.540 --> 01:01:13.240
arcade

01:01:13.240 --> 01:01:15.680
would be the same thing as the home version like look at me

01:01:15.680 --> 01:01:17.680
and then

01:01:17.680 --> 01:01:18.520
just be like

01:01:18.520 --> 01:01:22.640
you know everyone knee dropping and hand slapping all over again

01:01:22.640 --> 01:01:26.880
OK, so basically it's going to be based off of that routine there.

01:01:26.880 --> 01:01:30.880
Gee, no one bases their routines off of music videos or anything.

01:01:30.880 --> 01:01:32.400
No one emulates anybody.

01:01:32.400 --> 01:01:34.840
They're all original.

01:01:34.840 --> 01:01:39.600
Then again, do you really want people just imitating the home versions?

01:01:39.600 --> 01:01:42.520
It's better than watching people hump the bar, jump over the bar,

01:01:42.520 --> 01:01:47.540
run across the screen, hand slap, knee drop, and act like idiots.

01:01:47.540 --> 01:01:50.040
No, I don't mind people jumping over the bar for the few times

01:01:50.040 --> 01:01:51.520
that they miss and nut themselves.

01:01:51.520 --> 01:01:52.640
OK, well, that's fine.

01:01:52.640 --> 01:01:57.560
But other than that, though, well, other than freestyle

01:01:57.560 --> 01:02:02.040
mode or whatever that would be, my other idea was, now,

01:02:02.040 --> 01:02:03.320
StepMe has kind of done this.

01:02:03.320 --> 01:02:07.960
They have a mode in it called Minds, which is kind of neat.

01:02:07.960 --> 01:02:10.960
There's steps that go up, like arrows and stuff, normal,

01:02:10.960 --> 01:02:12.680
whatever, I don't know if it's randomly generated or

01:02:12.680 --> 01:02:16.160
whatever, but there's also steps that you can't step on.

01:02:16.160 --> 01:02:18.040
If you step on them, you lose health.

01:02:18.040 --> 01:02:19.040
This is what I've been saying.

01:02:19.040 --> 01:02:22.920
if DDR is going to come back in Japan, it needs to be competitive. I've said this like

01:02:22.920 --> 01:02:26.600
five out of the last ten shows, DDR needs to come back competitive, as a competitive

01:02:26.600 --> 01:02:31.600
game, as opposed to, let's have fun and hold hands and dance, and play cooperative, da-da-da-da-da-da-da.

01:02:31.600 --> 01:02:38.600
Everybody dance! And it needs to be fucking hardcore. Or, you know, like they have second

01:02:38.640 --> 01:02:42.120
mixed battle, needs to be something like that in there, they need something like dance magic,

01:02:42.120 --> 01:02:46.560
they need just anything that's competitive. I want at the very end of each battle round,

01:02:46.560 --> 01:02:52.560
There'd be smoke coming out of the middle of the city, and strobe lights, strobe lights, lots of strobe lights.

01:02:52.560 --> 01:02:58.560
Exactly. I want unison. I want all that shit back.

01:02:58.560 --> 01:03:01.560
I want second mixed version dance battle.

01:03:01.560 --> 01:03:08.560
DDR has gotten fucking tame as it's been going along, and it's time for DDR to get mean.

01:03:08.560 --> 01:03:14.560
Do you know how easy tournaments would be? Do you know how easy and common tournaments would be?

01:03:14.560 --> 01:03:22.880
they should have tournament mode where it's just already set up in the cabinet but uh yeah um what

01:03:22.880 --> 01:03:33.040
else could they have well definitely like um some new sort of unlocks you know but i like see i

01:03:33.040 --> 01:03:39.440
liked kind of like max usa's unlocks it was weird yeah where you did that it was where you could

01:03:39.440 --> 01:03:44.240
get it by doing the songs you had to do a lot more songs you know 500 songs to get drop the

01:03:44.240 --> 01:03:45.240
the bomb.

01:03:45.240 --> 01:03:46.240
That was worth it.

01:03:46.240 --> 01:03:49.200
But you could do other little stupid things to get them too.

01:03:49.200 --> 01:03:50.200
You're right.

01:03:50.200 --> 01:03:55.360
They need to find a happy medium between Max USA and Max 2 USA.

01:03:55.360 --> 01:04:01.040
Because Max USA, I got tired of playing like 500 songs to get the next unlock, but I also

01:04:01.040 --> 01:04:05.240
got tired of playing just 10 songs and getting the unlocks like super fast.

01:04:05.240 --> 01:04:09.340
So they need to kind of balance it out in the middle there somewhere and that'd be kind

01:04:09.340 --> 01:04:10.340
of cool.

01:04:10.340 --> 01:04:13.660
It's funny because when Marin in the chat room says, get mean, DDR runs around biting

01:04:13.660 --> 01:04:36.660
people

01:04:36.660 --> 01:04:43.260
Well, I think it was in Space... No, not Space Jam 5. It was in that Buster, um, move game or whatever that we were playing a while back.

01:04:43.260 --> 01:04:44.160
Uh, Dance Summit?

01:04:44.160 --> 01:04:50.860
Dance Summit, where if you do good in a song, or do perfect or whatever, that the song changes.

01:04:50.860 --> 01:04:53.960
Like, it kind of remixes itself. That would be kind of weird.

01:04:53.960 --> 01:04:55.560
But it'd be cool.

01:04:55.560 --> 01:04:56.660
Alright, I'm done.

01:04:56.660 --> 01:05:00.560
Okay, uh, we're gonna take a quick break, and this break we're gonna hear, uh, Heaven.

01:05:00.560 --> 01:05:06.460
This is a big one because, uh, this was the number one requested licensed song, please get it, and Konami did it.

01:05:06.460 --> 01:05:10.120
They Got Heaven and we're gonna hear the mix of that that's in DDR Max 2 USA and we're

01:05:10.120 --> 01:05:13.760
also gonna hear I Need You, which is one of the songs, is a Konami original that has not

01:05:13.760 --> 01:05:16.160
been in DDR any Bimani game before.

01:05:16.160 --> 01:05:19.440
And then we'll also hear Keep On Lifting, that song from BeatMania 3 that made it into

01:05:19.440 --> 01:05:20.960
Max 2 USA.

01:05:20.960 --> 01:05:24.320
When we come back, since we haven't gotten around to it yet, we usually kick off the

01:05:24.320 --> 01:05:26.920
show with it, but a lot of people have some stories they want to tell, we're gonna get

01:05:26.920 --> 01:05:30.040
into how was your day, how was your week, when we come back.

01:05:30.040 --> 01:05:37.040
Maybe you're all that I want When you're lying here in my eyes

01:05:37.040 --> 01:05:43.040
I'm finding it hard to believe we're in heaven

01:05:43.040 --> 01:06:10.960
Oh, I'm thinking about our younger years There was only you and me

01:06:10.960 --> 01:06:13.960
We were young and wild and for free

01:06:15.960 --> 01:06:18.960
Now nothing can take you away from me

01:06:20.960 --> 01:06:23.960
We've been through the road before

01:06:24.960 --> 01:06:26.960
That's over, no

01:06:27.960 --> 01:06:30.960
But you've been coming back for more

01:06:31.960 --> 01:06:33.960
Baby, you're all that I want

01:06:34.960 --> 01:06:37.960
When you're lying here in my house

01:06:37.960 --> 01:06:43.960
I'm finding it hard to believe we're in heaven

01:06:44.960 --> 01:06:47.960
And love is all that I need

01:06:48.960 --> 01:06:51.960
And I found it there in your heart

01:06:52.960 --> 01:06:54.960
It is too hard to see

01:06:55.960 --> 01:07:01.960
We're in heaven

01:07:31.960 --> 01:07:44.960
The promise of love doesn't have been good A little spark of wherever I've been to

01:07:44.960 --> 01:07:52.960
The place that I waited for all of my life And I don't know what we're gonna do

01:07:52.960 --> 01:07:56.960
I need you, need you

01:07:56.960 --> 01:08:00.960
And we know that I'm not alone

01:08:00.960 --> 01:08:02.960
You need that

01:08:02.960 --> 01:08:05.960
I know I'm the one

01:08:05.960 --> 01:08:11.960
I'm going to begin to love you

01:08:11.960 --> 01:08:18.960
Oh, believe, believe, believe me

01:08:48.960 --> 01:08:50.960
Yeah, and you don't stop

01:08:50.960 --> 01:08:51.960
Come on!

01:08:51.960 --> 01:08:53.960
Can you listen to the touch of jazz?

01:08:53.960 --> 01:08:54.960
Singing, drinking to the game

01:08:54.960 --> 01:08:56.960
You are loved when I say your name

01:08:56.960 --> 01:08:58.960
Bunch of rain, candlelight, wine and dine

01:08:58.960 --> 01:09:00.960
Punch line, non-stop dedication

01:09:00.960 --> 01:09:02.960
Rock the nation 24-7

01:09:02.960 --> 01:09:04.960
It feels like heaven, can you see the king's feet?

01:09:04.960 --> 01:09:07.960
Words rise, melody, poetry, you know me

01:09:07.960 --> 01:09:11.960
Hard time, long dawn, yeah, let's get it on

01:09:11.960 --> 01:09:16.960
What you did for me, I'm so grateful

01:09:16.960 --> 01:09:20.960
You lifted what was low, now I'm free

01:09:21.960 --> 01:09:25.960
You took the blindness off the icy clearance

01:09:25.960 --> 01:09:30.960
Created peace where the confusion had overtaken the flow

01:09:30.960 --> 01:09:32.960
You keep fallin' into me

01:09:32.960 --> 01:09:34.960
You keep fallin' into me

01:09:34.960 --> 01:09:37.960
No, and you keep fallin' into me

01:09:37.960 --> 01:09:40.960
Now I gotta say I'm feelin' better

01:09:40.960 --> 01:09:42.960
You keep fallin' into me

01:09:42.960 --> 01:09:44.960
You keep fallin' into me

01:09:44.960 --> 01:09:47.960
We go back to keep on living it like

01:09:47.960 --> 01:09:49.960
We're gonna take our feelings back

01:09:49.960 --> 01:09:51.960
I read the end of the block when you walked in

01:09:51.960 --> 01:09:53.960
Taking time to drop the rideline

01:09:53.960 --> 01:09:54.960
Cause you so fine, you're shine

01:09:54.960 --> 01:09:56.960
Now you're mine, it was meant to be

01:09:56.960 --> 01:09:58.960
You feel it forever baby, we are between

01:09:58.960 --> 01:10:00.960
Seeing dreams end up here, don't stop

01:10:00.960 --> 01:10:02.960
Like jazz and hip-hop, it can make your body and soul

01:10:02.960 --> 01:10:04.960
Our future grow, making dreams come true

01:10:04.960 --> 01:10:07.960
Coming strong, baby, do just me and you

01:10:07.960 --> 01:10:09.960
Yeah, you know how we do it

01:10:09.960 --> 01:10:30.840
Rock Over London, Rock Over Chicago, Orange Lounge Radio, it's a good place to listen

01:10:30.840 --> 01:10:34.520
to the music.

01:10:34.520 --> 01:10:37.600
Makes me sad, Wesley Willis, dead and gone.

01:10:37.600 --> 01:10:38.600
I cry.

01:10:38.600 --> 01:10:45.480
Alright, as promised, now is the part of the show where we go around and talk to our guests

01:10:45.480 --> 01:10:49.520
and we talk about how was your week and how was your day and I know some people have some

01:10:49.520 --> 01:10:53.960
exciting things to talk about and I, for one, I want to talk about, well, we'll get to that

01:10:53.960 --> 01:10:54.960
one when we get to me.

01:10:54.960 --> 01:10:57.180
Who wants to start tonight?

01:10:57.180 --> 01:10:58.180
You always do, Jamie.

01:10:58.180 --> 01:10:59.180
Go for it.

01:10:59.180 --> 01:11:03.320
I didn't know you always did, but fine, do it.

01:11:03.320 --> 01:11:05.360
Jamie is shoving a peanut in her mouth.

01:11:05.360 --> 01:11:07.100
What if other people want to go first today?

01:11:07.100 --> 01:11:12.940
But if other people want to go first today, screw them.

01:11:12.940 --> 01:11:16.860
My week has been okay.

01:11:16.860 --> 01:11:21.380
I've been sleep deprived all week, I haven't gotten more than four hours of sleep a night.

01:11:21.380 --> 01:11:24.180
So I crashed really bad on Friday night.

01:11:24.180 --> 01:11:28.620
I stayed up as late as I could, I used to play fantasy star, uh-uh.

01:11:28.620 --> 01:11:33.460
I barely had enough of an attention span for Ragnarok.

01:11:33.460 --> 01:11:39.620
I passed out like at 2 a.m., got up at 1130-ish, something like that.

01:11:39.620 --> 01:11:46.500
I went out and hung out with Iguana Girl all weekend, all Saturday, and we bought Iguana

01:11:46.500 --> 01:11:55.980
food for Moo, and watched Life of Brian and Jay and Silent Bob back to back while cutting

01:11:55.980 --> 01:11:56.980
it green.

01:11:56.980 --> 01:11:58.220
So my fingers turned green.

01:11:58.220 --> 01:11:59.820
It was scary.

01:11:59.820 --> 01:12:01.300
I played DDR Thursday.

01:12:01.300 --> 01:12:05.840
Oh my gosh, okay, you have to realize the past like three weeks I go here Jamie

01:12:05.840 --> 01:12:07.840
Do you have anything Bamani related? You want to tell us?

01:12:09.840 --> 01:12:14.020
You made it in your life journal entry and I know you keep your life journal

01:12:14.680 --> 01:12:19.500
friends only but maybe this is one you wouldn't mind sharing kind of about what you were saying about 40 minutes of DDS

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:25.540
306 calories burned. Hey, so and that's just like, you know on the medium mode on workout

01:12:26.120 --> 01:12:27.820
I'm workout mode

01:12:27.820 --> 01:12:29.820
on the old max

01:12:29.820 --> 01:12:34.780
Yeah, because that was before I got my MAX II.

01:12:34.780 --> 01:12:35.780
And you know what?

01:12:35.780 --> 01:12:37.200
It was pretty fun.

01:12:37.200 --> 01:12:39.140
I was really tired and everything.

01:12:39.140 --> 01:12:41.140
Yeah, this was Thursday.

01:12:41.140 --> 01:12:43.660
No, I'll take it back.

01:12:43.660 --> 01:12:44.660
It wasn't Thursday.

01:12:44.660 --> 01:12:45.660
It was Wednesday.

01:12:45.660 --> 01:12:46.660
Something like that.

01:12:46.660 --> 01:12:50.820
But anyway, I was still really tired.

01:12:50.820 --> 01:12:53.660
I've been so tired all week that I really haven't been able to put much more effort

01:12:53.660 --> 01:12:54.660
into it.

01:12:54.660 --> 01:12:58.780
But that's how, when I first started playing DDR,

01:12:58.780 --> 01:13:00.500
I played for an hour every night.

01:13:00.500 --> 01:13:01.620
I mean, more than an hour.

01:13:01.620 --> 01:13:03.100
I would do like two hours of nothing

01:13:03.100 --> 01:13:05.500
but knockout on second mix.

01:13:05.500 --> 01:13:08.300
And I'm thinking that that's what I'm going to do again.

01:13:08.300 --> 01:13:09.700
Better living through DDR.

01:13:09.700 --> 01:13:12.540
Seriously, I'm going to lose weight again.

01:13:12.540 --> 01:13:14.380
If I play more DDR, I'll lose weight again.

01:13:14.380 --> 01:13:18.540
So I'm going to get back into playing and mixing

01:13:18.540 --> 01:13:20.020
that with going to the gym.

01:13:20.020 --> 01:13:26.660
And Saturday, I got milk tea and boiled peanuts.

01:13:26.660 --> 01:13:28.940
And I don't know how many people know anything

01:13:28.940 --> 01:13:30.740
about living in the South.

01:13:30.740 --> 01:13:33.220
But I haven't, for years, I hadn't

01:13:33.220 --> 01:13:39.060
been able to find boiled peanuts until I moved out here,

01:13:39.060 --> 01:13:42.020
until I started shopping at the Asian food stores.

01:13:42.020 --> 01:13:43.980
So I was like, boiled peanuts.

01:13:43.980 --> 01:13:45.660
And they were fresh boiled peanuts.

01:13:45.660 --> 01:13:48.060
Everything was really good.

01:13:48.060 --> 01:13:56.300
And anyway, I've got some goodies.

01:13:56.300 --> 01:14:01.780
I have lots of key at home, picked up some treats for people.

01:14:01.780 --> 01:14:08.060
But boiled peanuts, that was like the highlight of my weekend was boiled peanuts.

01:14:08.060 --> 01:14:09.100
I never get them.

01:14:09.100 --> 01:14:12.620
The one thing that I wish I could find is boiled peanuts in a can.

01:14:12.620 --> 01:14:16.500
I've not been able to find those anywhere outside the South.

01:14:16.500 --> 01:14:19.260
So that's been my, yeah, and I've been busy with other stuff.

01:14:19.260 --> 01:14:23.700
The really crappy drama thing seems to have subsided, which I'm pretty glad for.

01:14:24.760 --> 01:14:25.260
And.

01:14:25.260 --> 01:14:26.020
There was drama?

01:14:27.200 --> 01:14:33.280
There was drama involving a site, but it's pretty much resolved.

01:14:33.620 --> 01:14:38.540
I've just been feeling really crappy all week, you know, in general, but it hasn't been a bad week.

01:14:39.640 --> 01:14:43.660
So, and they can't hear any of your commentary because you're busy sucking nuts.

01:14:43.660 --> 01:14:49.020
the look on your face is great

01:14:49.020 --> 01:14:53.300
my nuts are good, they're safe for consumption

01:14:53.300 --> 01:14:56.420
anyway

01:14:56.420 --> 01:14:59.860
you're done? GEEZ! I'm just saying

01:14:59.860 --> 01:15:03.580
are you done? yeah! are you dead?

01:15:03.580 --> 01:15:06.420
Erin's got her hand out so

01:15:06.420 --> 01:15:09.740
what? what? what? what? what?

01:15:09.740 --> 01:15:13.640
what? what? hi

01:15:13.640 --> 01:15:15.640
How was your week? How was your day?

01:15:15.640 --> 01:15:21.640
Alright, well, um, for those of you who know X to Nine Cent, aka Claudia, has officially got me addicted to Initial D!

01:15:21.640 --> 01:15:25.640
Boo! Damn her! Just kidding.

01:15:25.640 --> 01:15:29.640
Yeah, I spent a total, at least ten dollars on the game.

01:15:29.640 --> 01:15:35.640
Cause it's only, it's only like forty, it's only like forty cents at the MU to play.

01:15:35.640 --> 01:15:40.640
And, it's five tokens to a dollar, so, two tokens per game.

01:15:40.640 --> 01:15:49.280
so yeah five games for two dollars good shit also i started school this week and workload 57

01:15:49.280 --> 01:15:53.280
english 57 which is a stupid little remedial english class feels just like high school

01:15:54.320 --> 01:16:00.880
unfortunately so i'm stuck there for a quarter and yeah i have to interject real fast because

01:16:00.880 --> 01:16:06.080
the chat room won't shut up about this chat room i assure you we will play overloaded in the after

01:16:06.080 --> 01:16:11.600
to birth again, okay? There you go. Alright, sorry, Violent Hypergirl, go ahead.

01:16:11.600 --> 01:16:18.200
And Holly says, can I have your salty nuts? Uh, sure. Anyway, sorry to interrupt, do you

01:16:18.200 --> 01:16:22.040
want to finish your story? Well, yeah, I actually didn't get lost on campus for my first day

01:16:22.040 --> 01:16:28.000
of school, woohoo! And I've also become quite popular in the dorms after playing piano so

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:38.560
many times. Oh, you're already popular in the dorms, huh? Not that way! But yeah, other

01:16:38.560 --> 01:16:42.880
than that, we kind of settled in. Our apartments cooled down considerably. Davis has only been

01:16:42.880 --> 01:16:51.680
hitting upwards of, at best, 90 this past week. Yeah, it's been pretty good. And let's

01:16:51.680 --> 01:16:58.600
see. Anything special today? No, not really other than it's good to be on Orange Lounge

01:16:58.600 --> 01:17:02.520
when there's no internet problems. Yeah, it's nice to be here on a week where the station

01:17:02.520 --> 01:17:07.140
works, huh? For those of you that missed last week, you're better off, okay? Just trust

01:17:07.140 --> 01:17:10.680
us. We wrote it off. You know what though? You know what's interesting about last week's

01:17:10.680 --> 01:17:15.520
show, and I didn't realize this until I was going back and clipping it down for the archives.

01:17:15.520 --> 01:17:19.720
We did not take a single break last week at all. Yeah, you didn't notice that? We never

01:17:19.720 --> 01:17:23.440
I didn't notice that we did two hours straight so if you think about it, even though a lot

01:17:23.440 --> 01:17:26.800
of people were kind of like oh you guys only did two hours you know with all the problems

01:17:26.800 --> 01:17:32.280
even though we dropped you guys 37 times thanks to Comcast if you think about it with two

01:17:32.280 --> 01:17:36.080
hours straight of content you know throw breaks there really wasn't you didn't lose that much

01:17:36.080 --> 01:17:43.480
a show so shut up that's my point shut up yeah all right um let's see other than that

01:17:43.480 --> 01:17:46.660
I've actually had my room to myself I'm supposed to be sharing my room with my friend but she

01:17:46.660 --> 01:17:47.660
She hasn't been home.

01:17:47.660 --> 01:17:48.660
Lucky you.

01:17:48.660 --> 01:17:49.660
Oh!

01:17:49.660 --> 01:17:50.660
Does she have a boyfriend?

01:17:50.660 --> 01:17:51.660
Yeah, she's been spending...

01:17:51.660 --> 01:17:52.660
See, there you go.

01:17:52.660 --> 01:17:54.780
That's what always happens in college is that, you know, my roommate was the same way indoors

01:17:54.780 --> 01:17:56.460
that he was rushing a fraternity.

01:17:56.460 --> 01:18:00.580
So he was sleeping with all his boyfriends.

01:18:00.580 --> 01:18:04.900
And we all probably know what he was doing with all of them.

01:18:04.900 --> 01:18:07.820
Actually no, he also had a girlfriend that lived upstairs and he was staying there sometimes

01:18:07.820 --> 01:18:12.260
because the one time she came to stay there, I had a fit, okay?

01:18:12.260 --> 01:18:17.700
I was just like, I don't feel comfortable with her being here in the morning when I'm

01:18:17.700 --> 01:18:18.700
waking up.

01:18:18.700 --> 01:18:20.820
I'm just like, that's weird.

01:18:20.820 --> 01:18:21.820
Yeah.

01:18:21.820 --> 01:18:25.900
But yeah, okay, so anyone else want to talk about their week?

01:18:25.900 --> 01:18:26.900
Okay, so you're done.

01:18:26.900 --> 01:18:31.460
Bradley, you have anything you want to share about your week and your day?

01:18:31.460 --> 01:18:32.460
How was your week?

01:18:32.460 --> 01:18:33.460
How was your day, Bradley?

01:18:33.460 --> 01:18:34.460
Hold on.

01:18:34.460 --> 01:18:38.740
It's caught on the other one.

01:18:38.740 --> 01:18:39.740
Take it away.

01:18:39.740 --> 01:18:40.740
Okay.

01:18:40.740 --> 01:18:48.580
I didn't do all that much this week.

01:18:48.580 --> 01:18:56.060
Every so often, most of it was being lazy for most of the day, punctuated by fits every

01:18:56.060 --> 01:19:02.780
so often of looking for a job online, and applying to one or two or three places, and

01:19:02.780 --> 01:19:06.660
hopefully someone will call me, because if they don't, I might have to leave the state

01:19:06.660 --> 01:19:07.660
probably.

01:19:07.660 --> 01:19:08.660
Oh, shit.

01:19:08.660 --> 01:19:09.660
It sucks, yeah.

01:19:09.660 --> 01:19:10.660
That's not good.

01:19:10.660 --> 01:19:17.660
Hello, if you're out there and you want to hire somebody, RKDN42 Bradley, hire him.

01:19:17.660 --> 01:19:24.660
Well, most of it's because I'm stupid and it took too long to do stuff.

01:19:24.660 --> 01:19:27.660
Anyway, let's see, anything else I did this week?

01:19:27.660 --> 01:19:30.660
What else might I have done?

01:19:30.660 --> 01:19:35.660
Actually, I don't think I went anywhere any time this week, except for Wednesday I came

01:19:35.660 --> 01:19:38.660
over here and played some DDR Max 2.

01:19:38.660 --> 01:19:44.020
Since I only have the Japanese version, I don't have a U.S. PS2, so I got to experience

01:19:44.020 --> 01:19:45.020
that.

01:19:45.020 --> 01:19:46.020
Oh, good.

01:19:46.020 --> 01:19:47.020
Good deal.

01:19:47.020 --> 01:19:48.020
He went to...

01:19:48.020 --> 01:19:49.020
Yes.

01:19:49.020 --> 01:19:50.020
He went away.

01:19:50.020 --> 01:19:54.660
Went far, far away to get power.

01:19:54.660 --> 01:19:55.660
Staying in power.

01:19:55.660 --> 01:19:56.660
Here he is.

01:19:56.660 --> 01:19:57.660
Puppy, there he is.

01:19:57.660 --> 01:19:58.660
I should have made him give me something too.

01:19:58.660 --> 01:19:59.660
Oh well.

01:19:59.660 --> 01:20:00.660
I should have sent him a shopping list.

01:20:00.660 --> 01:20:01.660
Yeah, go back.

01:20:01.660 --> 01:20:02.660
She didn't go anywhere yesterday.

01:20:02.660 --> 01:20:03.660
I thought I went somewhere yesterday.

01:20:03.660 --> 01:20:04.660
Oh crap.

01:20:04.660 --> 01:20:09.340
I thought I went somewhere yesterday, oh crap, now I can't remember where I went.

01:20:09.340 --> 01:20:14.180
I think I might have went to Walmart, or actually I went to Walmart today.

01:20:14.180 --> 01:20:17.620
Damn I also forget why I didn't do one thing and I forget what I did.

01:20:17.620 --> 01:20:29.500
Oh actually I went to the post office to mail stuff I sold off and then today I watched

01:20:29.500 --> 01:20:32.160
the debate from wednesday after

01:20:32.160 --> 01:20:34.280
the governor's debate

01:20:34.280 --> 01:20:35.440
and being silly

01:20:35.440 --> 01:20:36.880
yeah it was

01:20:36.880 --> 01:20:39.040
sorta

01:20:39.040 --> 01:20:42.880
okay not all that great of a debate

01:20:42.880 --> 01:20:45.640
arnold didn't really impress me all that much

01:20:45.640 --> 01:20:49.680
he was more impressed by when he was on

01:20:49.680 --> 01:20:51.480
what's-his-face larry king

01:20:51.480 --> 01:20:54.480
he was a bit more

01:20:54.480 --> 01:20:56.400
no no he was on larry king like

01:20:56.400 --> 01:21:07.360
two weeks ago. And, that's pretty much my week. So exciting! Alright, thanks for sharing.

01:21:07.360 --> 01:21:13.760
You're just jumping up and down now. Alright, we'll put Puppey on the spot since he dared

01:21:13.760 --> 01:21:26.880
to leave the show property how was your week how's your day traitor okay this

01:21:26.880 --> 01:21:37.040
week I started classes yay and I spent most of my time playing this guy until I

01:21:37.040 --> 01:21:43.240
got max 2 and then I spent all the time playing that and the occasional initial

01:21:43.240 --> 01:22:00.240
D-Binge too. Yesterday, I went to Roseville to play F-Zero for nine straight hours. Call

01:22:00.240 --> 01:22:03.480
me an addict, I don't care. It's true.

01:22:03.480 --> 01:22:07.240
Was the price down to four tokens by then?

01:22:07.240 --> 01:22:08.240
Yes, it was.

01:22:08.240 --> 01:22:11.340
For the first two days, it was six tokens a game.

01:22:11.340 --> 01:22:15.340
And they also didn't have the real cars until Saturday.

01:22:19.340 --> 01:22:21.340
As I finished chewing my candy.

01:22:21.340 --> 01:22:23.340
Yeah, hello, you're on the radio, don't eat.

01:22:23.340 --> 01:22:24.340
Whatever.

01:22:25.340 --> 01:22:27.340
So I spent nine hours.

01:22:28.340 --> 01:22:30.340
I played 37 games.

01:22:30.340 --> 01:22:31.340
In a row?

01:22:31.340 --> 01:22:32.340
No.

01:22:33.340 --> 01:22:35.340
I knew that was coming.

01:22:35.340 --> 01:22:36.340
I had to!

01:22:36.340 --> 01:22:39.340
It was like the cursed number of the show.

01:22:39.340 --> 01:22:53.340
And then I started from scratch on a brand new card and worked my way all the way up to the highest rank possible as a Master Class license.

01:22:53.340 --> 01:23:01.340
I got all the way up to that and I took all the records on five of the six tracks on Time Attack.

01:23:01.340 --> 01:23:14.340
And then today I woke up at 1.30 and then sat in the apartment and then came here.

01:23:14.340 --> 01:23:16.340
Alright, yeah.

01:23:16.340 --> 01:23:18.340
Anything else you want to share?

01:23:18.340 --> 01:23:25.340
Random non-stops have been keeping me up late at night because it's just ridiculously fun.

01:23:25.340 --> 01:23:32.340
Even though it screws you over with things like Subaru Dark Reverse Stealth.

01:23:32.340 --> 01:23:38.340
The one time we played it here on Wednesday when we were broadcasting, they got a really

01:23:38.340 --> 01:23:39.340
easy one.

01:23:39.340 --> 01:23:41.940
It was like all standard songs, it was stupid.

01:23:41.940 --> 01:23:43.700
You haven't played it enough then?

01:23:43.700 --> 01:23:44.700
Apparently.

01:23:44.700 --> 01:23:45.700
Okay.

01:23:45.700 --> 01:23:48.300
Let's do some really fucked up things.

01:23:48.300 --> 01:23:51.340
Loki, have a second to tell us about your week and your day?

01:23:51.340 --> 01:23:52.340
Yeah.

01:23:52.340 --> 01:23:53.340
Alright.

01:23:53.340 --> 01:23:54.340
How was your day?

01:23:54.340 --> 01:24:00.460
My week was alright, didn't do a whole lot.

01:24:00.460 --> 01:24:11.040
Stopped doing live wire because Thursday nights only 4 people were listening to me and I work

01:24:11.040 --> 01:24:15.940
on it for 3 hours and that's not a very good mix so I'm taking time off until I feel like

01:24:15.940 --> 01:24:21.620
doing it again and then it'll be Wednesdays and then today I've been soldering and for

01:24:21.620 --> 01:24:26.460
For some fucking reason in the last five minutes, the solder gun does not want to melt the solder,

01:24:26.460 --> 01:24:27.460
period.

01:24:27.460 --> 01:24:35.740
So I'm trying to clean the tip, because I think that's what's wrong.

01:24:35.740 --> 01:24:36.740
And let's see.

01:24:36.740 --> 01:24:37.740
Well, you know what?

01:24:37.740 --> 01:24:41.060
You should ditch your class to listen to my show, 23 Maggots.

01:24:41.060 --> 01:24:44.820
Don't fucking mention shit if it's out of your control, dumbass.

01:24:44.820 --> 01:24:51.820
Well, if I wasn't dead with the computer and the modem, I wouldn't do it, too.

01:24:51.820 --> 01:24:57.820
Yeah, the whole world would listen to me, too, also.

01:24:57.820 --> 01:24:58.820
Anyways.

01:24:58.820 --> 01:25:03.820
There's one eel, and there's two of them.

01:25:03.820 --> 01:25:04.820
What else?

01:25:04.820 --> 01:25:09.820
Also, today I went shopping and got some more controllers so I can work on my pads.

01:25:09.820 --> 01:25:12.820
I got all the wiring done on my pads, so that's kinda cool.

01:25:12.820 --> 01:25:18.820
And this should be done hopefully next week, but I don't know because it's been going really slowly.

01:25:18.820 --> 01:25:21.820
And then that's it. I'm done.

01:25:21.820 --> 01:25:25.820
Oh, went and played F-Zero. That was kind of neat.

01:25:25.820 --> 01:25:29.820
That was about it.

01:25:29.820 --> 01:25:34.820
I'm done. I'm done.

01:25:34.820 --> 01:25:38.820
All right. I need to talk about my week of my day. I can't eat right now.

01:25:38.820 --> 01:25:39.820
All right, my week of my day.

01:25:39.820 --> 01:25:49.820
My week is pretty good. I saw a lot of movies this week. I've been hanging out with Joey, who's been on the show the past couple of weeks, and he likes to watch a lot of movies at home, so I've been catching up on all these movies I didn't see.

01:25:49.820 --> 01:26:00.820
I finally saw Resident Evil for the first time, which was stupid. Also, though, on Thursday was when Roseville Golf Land finally got Max 2, and that made me as happy as a little girl.

01:26:00.820 --> 01:26:07.260
What the hell am I talking about?

01:26:07.260 --> 01:26:09.820
I'm torn between food and making sense.

01:26:09.820 --> 01:26:10.820
I mean F-Zero.

01:26:10.820 --> 01:26:14.760
GolfLink got F-Zero and I was so excited because I've been wanting to play F-Zero in the arcade

01:26:14.760 --> 01:26:15.760
for so long.

01:26:15.760 --> 01:26:17.940
And F-Zero in the arcade is awesome.

01:26:17.940 --> 01:26:19.820
It is so awesome.

01:26:19.820 --> 01:26:21.680
And I love how it links with the home version.

01:26:21.680 --> 01:26:29.620
You can practically unlock all of AX for your GX if you play enough in the arcade.

01:26:29.620 --> 01:26:33.500
So after playing F-Zero a lot, and I like to play it where you ride, too, where you

01:26:33.500 --> 01:26:36.020
go move with the thing when you put the seat belt on.

01:26:36.020 --> 01:26:40.060
I only did that a couple times, but they have a motion machine at Roswell Golf Line, so

01:26:40.060 --> 01:26:41.060
it makes it more fun.

01:26:41.060 --> 01:26:45.340
I don't like doing the motion on the harder courses, because it's ridiculous.

01:26:45.340 --> 01:26:49.600
Since the steering wheel itself doesn't move with the rest of the seat, it's ridiculously

01:26:49.600 --> 01:26:51.240
hard to steer.

01:26:51.240 --> 01:26:54.220
A little bit, yeah, that's true.

01:26:54.220 --> 01:26:58.500
I don't do it anymore, but it was fun the first couple times to go, wee, wee.

01:26:58.500 --> 01:27:00.500
Did you play all the courses?

01:27:00.500 --> 01:27:04.500
I haven't played them all. No, I've been trying to just play them and race and try to unlock them.

01:27:04.500 --> 01:27:09.500
I love Aeropolis. I love the one on the home version. That's one of my favorite tracks, so I had to play that a lot.

01:27:09.500 --> 01:27:11.500
And then I've been playing the outer space one a little bit earlier.

01:27:11.500 --> 01:27:13.500
Green Plant is fucking crazy.

01:27:15.500 --> 01:27:18.500
The last course is fucking crazy. It's like four minutes long.

01:27:18.500 --> 01:27:20.500
Yeah. It's only one lap, isn't it?

01:27:20.500 --> 01:27:21.500
It's three laps.

01:27:21.500 --> 01:27:22.500
Really? Dang.

01:27:22.500 --> 01:27:24.500
Yeah. It's like...

01:27:24.500 --> 01:27:27.500
The average race on that course is like four and a half minutes.

01:27:27.500 --> 01:27:35.900
minutes. That's cool. So F-Zero was cool. And you know what? It got me to go to Roso

01:27:35.900 --> 01:27:41.060
Golf Land and when I was able to play there, it was a Thursday night, about 8 o'clock,

01:27:41.060 --> 01:27:46.940
so there weren't a lot of kids there and it was nice and quiet and DDR was so loud because

01:27:46.940 --> 01:27:50.780
not a lot of games were going and I got to play Conga Feelin' on 4th Plus and I got to

01:27:50.780 --> 01:27:54.580
blast the shit out of it and I had so much fun playing DDR and I haven't had that in

01:27:54.580 --> 01:27:58.880
a long time so I'm actually on good terms with the Roswell Golf Line again and I'm going

01:27:58.880 --> 01:27:59.880
to be going there more often.

01:27:59.880 --> 01:28:00.980
It's a revival!

01:28:00.980 --> 01:28:01.980
It's weird.

01:28:01.980 --> 01:28:06.560
I actually, I kind of want to bring back like how we used to go there once a week.

01:28:06.560 --> 01:28:10.060
I kind of want to bring that back, I just don't know when.

01:28:10.060 --> 01:28:11.320
I don't know.

01:28:11.320 --> 01:28:12.320
Maybe Thursday nights.

01:28:12.320 --> 01:28:15.300
And then you can warn the boss of 2DX.

01:28:15.300 --> 01:28:20.100
Well actually Scandia fixed their 2DX machine, Scandia fixed some of their stuff so I kind

01:28:20.100 --> 01:28:21.100
of have to share time.

01:28:21.100 --> 01:28:24.180
Well as of yesterday, 2DX still sucked.

01:28:24.180 --> 01:28:33.220
I couldn't play right side very well. I couldn't pass. I failed deadline light seven because I couldn't pass because the frickin keys stuck so much

01:28:35.380 --> 01:28:41.240
It was ridiculous, and then I end up playing left side auto scratch so I could just pass songs

01:28:44.940 --> 01:28:47.260
Dead air um okay

01:28:47.260 --> 01:28:49.760
OK.

01:28:49.760 --> 01:28:52.180
That's pretty much all I have to say about my day and my week.

01:28:52.180 --> 01:28:57.060
So I think what we're going to do, we're going to take a break.

01:28:57.060 --> 01:29:01.380
And when we come back, we'll talk a little bit more,

01:29:01.380 --> 01:29:03.520
and then we'll get into the cage match.

01:29:03.520 --> 01:29:05.300

In this break, we're going to hear some more

01:29:21.780 --> 01:29:27.540
Max 2 USA MB3s, such as, where did we leave off last time?

01:29:27.540 --> 01:29:30.420
We're going to hear Love at First Sight, the Kylie song.

01:29:30.420 --> 01:29:32.060
More Deep, version 2.1.

01:29:32.060 --> 01:29:33.180
Who's tapping on the mic?

01:29:33.180 --> 01:29:34.300
Stop.

01:29:34.300 --> 01:29:36.280
More Deep, version 2.1.

01:29:36.280 --> 01:29:37.860
And Take Me Away Into the Night.

01:29:37.860 --> 01:29:39.560
We're going to hear all those this break.

01:29:39.560 --> 01:29:40.300
We will be back.

01:30:10.300 --> 01:30:16.300
One of the things that I didn't know what to do

01:30:16.300 --> 01:30:19.300
Then there was you

01:30:19.300 --> 01:30:23.300
But the feeling went so wrong tonight

01:30:23.300 --> 01:30:27.300
And the stars came up still the same

01:30:27.300 --> 01:30:30.300
The music they were playing really blew my mind

01:30:30.300 --> 01:30:36.780
My new love is just like a baby

01:30:36.780 --> 01:30:41.980
Well, I heard for a long, long, long time

01:30:41.980 --> 01:30:49.500
I knew we were meant to be a song

01:30:49.500 --> 01:30:57.500
I heard for a long, long, long, long time

01:30:57.500 --> 01:31:07.500
I will be whatever you desire

01:31:27.500 --> 01:31:34.500
Don't stop sleeping with me

01:31:34.500 --> 01:31:42.500
We don't fear, we don't love you

01:32:12.500 --> 01:32:19.500
You found it deep, deep down, instantly

01:32:19.500 --> 01:32:24.500
I do wish eternity

01:32:24.500 --> 01:32:27.500
Just for

01:32:31.500 --> 01:32:38.500
Just for sweet, sweet, sweet

01:32:38.500 --> 01:32:41.700
Keep on breathing

01:32:52.700 --> 01:32:54.500
Shining light

01:32:56.100 --> 01:32:59.500
Another day turns into night

01:32:59.500 --> 01:33:01.500
Eternal fire

01:33:03.100 --> 01:33:05.700
Waiting all my life

01:33:05.700 --> 01:33:12.700
Take me away, million miles away from here

01:33:12.700 --> 01:33:19.700
Take me away, find a place for you and me

01:33:19.700 --> 01:33:26.700
You're taking me higher, high as I could be

01:33:26.700 --> 01:33:32.700
Take me away, forever you and me

01:33:32.700 --> 01:33:34.700
Take me away

01:33:44.200 --> 01:33:46.200
Take me away

01:33:47.700 --> 01:33:50.700
Million miles away from me

01:33:51.200 --> 01:33:53.200
Take me away

01:33:54.700 --> 01:33:57.700
Find a place for you and me

01:33:58.200 --> 01:34:00.200
Take me higher

01:34:00.200 --> 01:34:13.200
High as I could see, take me away Forever you and me, take me away

01:34:30.200 --> 01:34:34.440
Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 62 in progress.

01:34:34.440 --> 01:34:39.560
I'm joined tonight by my lovely co-hosts, DarkSakra and TechMasaLoki.

01:34:39.560 --> 01:34:43.760
Also in the house, puppy and violent hyper girl, BlackLab.

01:34:43.760 --> 01:34:44.760
We call him Puppy.

01:34:44.760 --> 01:34:47.200
He's not BlackLab here, he's Puppy.

01:34:47.200 --> 01:34:50.400
It's funny when everybody starts calling me that and then I start getting called that

01:34:50.400 --> 01:34:51.400
in person.

01:34:51.400 --> 01:34:53.440
Oh my God, he has a flashing foot on DNR Freak.

01:34:53.440 --> 01:34:55.640
Yes, I get the seizure foot.

01:34:55.640 --> 01:34:58.200
Wait a minute, how much longer?

01:34:58.200 --> 01:34:59.200
Arcadian 42.

01:34:59.200 --> 01:35:28.200
How do you try to love somebody that doesn't just happen like diarrhea?

01:35:28.200 --> 01:35:32.200
Maybe like, I don't know, I don't even want to try and guess.

01:35:32.200 --> 01:35:35.200
I don't get that trying thing, you're just supposed to do it.

01:35:35.200 --> 01:35:38.200
You know what, why don't you write Konami a letter?

01:35:38.200 --> 01:35:44.200
Yeah, we should all write one big letter to Konami about what we think they should do with DDR.

01:35:44.200 --> 01:35:48.200
Interesting question came up in the chat room, kind of going back to Max2USA.

01:35:48.200 --> 01:35:50.200
Favorite license song?

01:35:50.200 --> 01:35:52.200
Probably

01:35:53.920 --> 01:35:56.980
License favorite license, uh, I'd have to say

01:35:57.940 --> 01:35:59.040
No

01:35:59.040 --> 01:36:00.600
max to

01:36:00.600 --> 01:36:02.560
max to yeah, um

01:36:02.560 --> 01:36:04.560
actually I have to say that um a

01:36:04.960 --> 01:36:09.760
Little bit of ecstasy is I what I thought it would be very fun for the studs

01:36:09.760 --> 01:36:11.860
But it actually did or they did a really good job with it

01:36:11.860 --> 01:36:16.860
And it's like the slow down it is like era and it's like whoa shit is fun

01:36:46.860 --> 01:36:52.100
say as much as I really want to say Kylie, I keep thinking that's a Euromix song that

01:36:52.100 --> 01:36:57.380
we just kind of got, so I do have to say Take Me Away into the Night is my favorite as well.

01:36:57.380 --> 01:37:00.140
And the video is kind of interesting, but what's weird about the video is in the video

01:37:00.140 --> 01:37:03.860
it's a black chick singing, but in the other Four Strings video I've seen, Diving, it's

01:37:03.860 --> 01:37:08.860
like this white girl with red hair. It's weird. So did they change singers or what did they

01:37:08.860 --> 01:37:12.620
do? It's weird. You know what? They're messing with your head. They're messing with my head

01:37:12.620 --> 01:37:16.340
and I don't like it. You know what I don't like about the Kylie video? I've decided.

01:37:16.340 --> 01:37:23.460
makeup? Her makeup is awful and those earrings are gaudy. Will I in Heaven are really close

01:37:23.460 --> 01:37:27.420
right there to Take Me Away. I love Will I. Maybe that is better than Take Me Away. I

01:37:27.420 --> 01:37:35.020
don't know. Make up your mind. I can't. They're all good. You're being a woman. I can't. I

01:37:35.020 --> 01:37:41.980
love Will I. I know I saw she even put it in the chat room which is why I said it. Let

01:37:41.980 --> 01:37:48.180
them boobs, whatever, you guys are weird. Look at them. Your chat rooms are weird. www.calibamani.com

01:37:48.180 --> 01:37:52.680
click on the ones on the chat. It's no silent, of course it's weird. I want to bring this

01:37:52.680 --> 01:37:55.940
up real fast. There's some interesting 2DX news that hit this week. You guys have been

01:37:55.940 --> 01:38:02.700
wondering what 2DX 7th style is? Do you guys want to know when 2DX 7th style is coming

01:38:02.700 --> 01:38:06.660
out? Konami has made an announcement about it. After you vote for it. This is the deal. In

01:38:06.660 --> 01:38:07.860
Order it.

01:38:07.860 --> 01:38:09.660
Benmani style, put out the news this week.

01:38:09.660 --> 01:38:11.340
Jamie, you want to run down by it?

01:38:11.340 --> 01:38:13.420
I glanced at it.

01:38:13.420 --> 01:38:15.220
I didn't bother translating the page yet,

01:38:15.220 --> 01:38:18.020
because I'm just going to order it from Humaya.

01:38:18.020 --> 01:38:20.980
But there's a big voting poll.

01:38:20.980 --> 01:38:24.660
And if enough people vote, then they're

01:38:24.660 --> 01:38:27.700
going to put out another 2DX.

01:38:27.700 --> 01:38:30.260
Yeah, and I don't know if they're going to get enough.

01:38:30.260 --> 01:38:33.020
Isn't it supposed to be like 7th and 8th?

01:38:33.020 --> 01:38:35.140
Isn't it supposed to be something like 7th and 8th

01:38:35.140 --> 01:38:36.140
mix together.

01:38:36.140 --> 01:38:42.380
That's the rumor, but you know, I'm not horribly excited, because I know that not enough people

01:38:42.380 --> 01:38:43.380
are going to vote for it.

01:38:43.380 --> 01:38:48.740
Well, I don't know, if enough people vote for it, then it'll be good, but I'm just going

01:38:48.740 --> 01:38:53.900
to order it from Himea anyway, because I already, you already know about my trouble with Konami

01:38:53.900 --> 01:38:54.900
style.

01:38:54.900 --> 01:38:59.500
Oh, you don't have the right kind of credit card, we're going to revoke your 2DX controller

01:38:59.500 --> 01:39:00.500
order.

01:39:00.500 --> 01:39:01.500
Bite me!

01:39:01.500 --> 01:39:09.820
You know what's interesting is that a lot of this came up because 2DX, they announced

01:39:09.820 --> 01:39:13.660
that they're going to make new controllers and suddenly people went, wait a minute Konami,

01:39:13.660 --> 01:39:17.480
why is Konami making new 2DX arcade style controllers if they haven't put out a home

01:39:17.480 --> 01:39:18.480
version forever?

01:39:18.480 --> 01:39:21.520
And that's kind of where this came about is that it was like, okay, now maybe since they're

01:39:21.520 --> 01:39:24.500
doing these controllers, they're going to do a new consumer style too.

01:39:24.500 --> 01:39:29.340
Now with the new controllers though, then I might have to toss down the 400 to order

01:39:29.340 --> 01:39:42.580
mine from Himea if you want to see the information on that you can head on over

01:39:42.580 --> 01:39:46.140
to I'm just gonna tell you to go bimani style calm because they have the links

01:39:46.140 --> 01:39:49.700
there on the front page which isn't loading for me right now bastards oh

01:39:49.700 --> 01:39:57.420
well they have the links to Konami the site that you'll need so how about a

01:39:57.420 --> 01:40:03.180
cage match you guys. Sure. You know what, I hope it happens though. I really want 7th

01:40:03.180 --> 01:40:08.340
Style at home. I want Beauty and Silence so bad. What makes me sad is that they'll probably

01:40:08.340 --> 01:40:11.980
cut all the licensed tracks if they're having to scrounge to do this and that makes me a

01:40:11.980 --> 01:40:18.700
sad little panda. Where the fuck is my Dance Maniacs home version you bastard? I just want

01:40:18.700 --> 01:40:25.100
to play Last Message at home. This is like one of the few 7th stars I can pass. I can

01:40:25.100 --> 01:40:34.820
pass like last message I can pass that monkey dance and uh what's the other seven I can

01:40:34.820 --> 01:40:41.360
pass Rob? Please don't go. That's what I thought. Breaking my fingers working on Love Me Do

01:40:41.360 --> 01:40:51.440
I gave up. Oh my god my fingers bleeding I cannot play the 2DX anymore. Oh my god I am

01:41:27.740 --> 01:41:31.620
forums anymore is the quote thread which is I think the last thing that I saw in

01:41:31.620 --> 01:41:36.260

01:42:14.060 --> 01:42:27.460
Last week was interesting because of the Comcast problems we weren't able to get enough voters

01:42:27.460 --> 01:42:31.760
from our chat room so we combined their votes with in-house voting which we haven't done

01:42:31.760 --> 01:42:36.760
in a long time but we're going to go back to a strictly chat room vote tonight so make

week it came down to a tie between Loki's latest remix and Jamie's song and I picked

01:42:49.440 --> 01:42:53.160
I picked Jamie's song because I felt bad she hadn't won in a while and I liked her song

01:42:53.160 --> 01:42:54.160
anyway.

01:42:54.160 --> 01:42:55.160
I got the pity vote.

01:42:55.160 --> 01:42:56.160
She got a pity vote.

01:42:56.160 --> 01:42:57.160
What?

01:42:57.160 --> 01:42:58.160
Loki's song didn't suck.

01:42:58.160 --> 01:42:59.160
Quit saying it.

01:42:59.160 --> 01:43:00.160
He says his song sucked.

01:43:00.160 --> 01:43:01.160
It didn't suck.

01:43:01.160 --> 01:43:02.800
Alright, so here it is.

01:43:02.800 --> 01:43:05.680
Here's last week's winner and the first song you can vote for tonight.

01:43:05.680 --> 01:43:10.280
It's Free Fall featuring Jan Johnston, who I rather like, and this song is called Skydive.

01:43:10.280 --> 01:43:11.280
Enjoy.

01:43:11.280 --> 01:43:15.700
Actually, we're only gonna play a clip of it because it did win last week. So here you go

01:43:41.280 --> 01:43:59.280
This is me with all the expectations We know the love we have to hold each other

01:44:00.280 --> 01:44:03.280
Every time you've been loved No separate degrees

01:44:03.280 --> 01:44:09.280
Now we're here, we have our role and we're here

01:44:20.280 --> 01:44:24.280
Connect your words, I have them in the dark

01:44:24.280 --> 01:44:29.780
The silence you smile, and even miss you in my sleep

01:44:34.780 --> 01:44:39.780
No rush, no lust, no lie, this journey is all out

01:44:39.780 --> 01:44:45.780
You're my hero, heaven did you come

01:45:09.780 --> 01:45:29.580
All right, that was last week's winner, Jan Johnston with the band Free Fall with a song

01:45:29.580 --> 01:45:31.220
called Skydive.

01:45:31.220 --> 01:45:33.180
Next up is Loki's pick.

01:45:33.180 --> 01:45:35.260
Loki, what did you pick for us tonight?

01:45:35.260 --> 01:45:36.900
Guess what came out this week?

01:45:36.900 --> 01:45:40.740
Yep, that's right a Yumi trance 3. Yes, that's right

01:45:40.740 --> 01:45:44.740
I picked another Yumi trance song because I'm lazy and I don't care

01:45:45.220 --> 01:45:49.900
So you get to listen to naturally the whipping bird mix because naturally is pretty cool

01:45:49.900 --> 01:45:54.700
All right, here it is. Song number two in tonight's cage match. It's Yumi Hamasaki from

01:47:19.900 --> 01:47:21.900
Oh

01:50:19.900 --> 01:50:21.900
We can go

01:50:21.900 --> 01:50:23.900
We can go

01:50:23.900 --> 01:50:38.360
Alright gang, that was song number two in tonight's cage match.

01:50:38.360 --> 01:50:43.100
New entry Ayumi Hamasaki from Cybertrance3 with Naturally the Wittenberg Mix.

01:50:43.100 --> 01:50:46.500
Let's go around and see what the room thought of it, starting off with Who's Got a Mic?

01:50:46.500 --> 01:50:47.500
Jamie.

01:50:47.500 --> 01:50:48.500
It's Transtastic.

01:50:48.500 --> 01:50:49.500
Um, nine.

01:50:49.500 --> 01:51:03.500
I like the original naturally better, but this is still good. I give it an 8.

01:51:03.500 --> 01:51:07.500
Alrighty. Violent Hyper Girl.

01:51:07.500 --> 01:51:10.500
I think it's cool just because I like Ayumi.

01:51:10.500 --> 01:51:12.500
And on a scale of 1 to 10, you give it a?

01:51:12.500 --> 01:51:14.500
Probably a 7 or 8.

01:51:14.500 --> 01:51:16.500
7 or 8, so 7 and a half.

01:51:16.500 --> 01:51:17.500
Yeah.

01:51:17.500 --> 01:51:19.500
You can do halves, it's acceptable.

01:51:19.500 --> 01:51:21.500
Yay, good enough.

01:51:21.500 --> 01:51:23.500
Bradley or Logie, whoever grabs the mic. Bradley?

01:51:23.500 --> 01:51:26.500
It's not pretty good. I'll give it a nine.

01:51:26.500 --> 01:51:32.500
Give it a nine. I think it was pretty rockin'. It's not my favorite song on the new Trance CD, but it's pretty good. Eight and a half.

01:51:32.500 --> 01:51:35.500
Logie?

01:51:35.500 --> 01:51:40.500
Motherfuckin' controller I slashed across the ground and that's bad.

01:51:40.500 --> 01:51:43.500
Anyways, um, I give it a...

01:51:43.500 --> 01:51:49.500
I don't give a crap because I picked it randomly out of the CD I downloaded, so...

01:51:49.500 --> 01:51:51.500
Yeah.

01:51:51.500 --> 01:51:53.500
I give it a...

01:51:53.500 --> 01:51:55.500
9.

01:51:55.500 --> 01:51:56.500
9.

01:51:56.500 --> 01:51:58.500
I give the ferret sex a 10!

01:51:58.500 --> 01:52:04.500
Alright, so there you have it, the votes for Yumi Hamasaki would naturally, but remember the ultimate decision is up to you.

01:52:04.500 --> 01:52:13.500
And, uh, head on over to our chat room, www.calibomani.com, click on Orange Club, mental note, or you can write this down somewhere.

01:52:13.500 --> 01:52:18.500
Flash game, Ferret Sex, the Flash game, for when the website comes up.

01:52:18.500 --> 01:52:22.500
I'll work on that when we get our other website up, which we've been needing to do for a month.

01:52:22.500 --> 01:52:25.500
Or even, like, just like an animated GIF or something.

01:52:25.500 --> 01:52:27.500
What, puppy?

01:52:27.500 --> 01:52:29.500
No, I'm not gonna do that.

01:52:29.500 --> 01:52:37.500
Next up is my pick and I assure you what will go down in history is a Rob classic pick tonight.

01:52:37.500 --> 01:52:47.500
Don't blame me because I asked the room, do you want my pick tonight to be something trance or something booty and foul?

01:52:47.500 --> 01:52:51.500
And they picked booty and foul, so this is the song you get.

01:52:51.500 --> 01:52:57.500
If my baby mama can make solo bass, I think this song can make solo bass.

01:52:57.500 --> 01:53:02.780
So this is my pick for tonight, it's a group call, and I have to thank the Ice Queen, he

01:53:02.780 --> 01:53:05.700
recommended this one to me, Ice Queen recommended me this one.

01:53:05.700 --> 01:53:09.140
This is Fanny Pack, with a song called Camel Toe.

01:53:09.140 --> 01:53:11.480
And enjoy camel tell enjoy

01:53:39.140 --> 01:53:45.620
That's right, uh-huh, uh-huh Mm-hmm, that's right, uh-huh, uh-huh

01:53:45.620 --> 01:53:48.620
Walking down the street, something caught my eye

01:53:48.620 --> 01:53:52.620
A growing epidemic that really ain't fly

01:53:52.620 --> 01:53:56.620
This little-aged lady, I gotta be blunt

01:53:56.620 --> 01:53:59.620
A Spanish biker, sure as word, creeping up the front

01:53:59.620 --> 01:54:03.620
I could see her uterus, her pants was too tight

01:54:03.620 --> 01:54:07.620
She mustn't own pennies if we're not up in sight

01:54:07.620 --> 01:54:11.020
You walk right by, the poor woman didn't know

01:54:11.020 --> 01:54:14.520
She had a frontal wedgie, a camel toe

01:54:14.520 --> 01:54:18.520
Mm-hmm, that's right, uh-huh, oh no

01:54:18.520 --> 01:54:22.020
Think she's dope, girl, you got a camel toe

01:54:22.020 --> 01:54:26.020
Mm-hmm, that's right, uh-huh, oh no

01:54:26.020 --> 01:54:29.520
Think she's dope, girl, you got a camel toe

01:54:29.520 --> 01:54:33.020
Girl, that's gotta hurt, take some time in the dust

01:54:33.020 --> 01:54:36.520
Can't you see people staring and making the fuss

01:54:36.520 --> 01:54:40.020
I cannot believe my eyes had to take a second glance

01:54:40.020 --> 01:54:42.020
Is your crotch hungry, girl?

01:54:42.020 --> 01:54:43.520
Cuz you're eating your pants

01:54:43.520 --> 01:54:47.020
Do you enjoy the commotion and the tension it brings?

01:54:47.020 --> 01:54:51.020
The only lips I wanna see are the ones that sing

01:54:51.020 --> 01:54:55.020
In public, put it on and x-ray the show

01:54:55.020 --> 01:54:58.520
Cursing people out with your camel toe

01:54:58.520 --> 01:55:02.520
Mm-hmm, that's right, uh-huh, oh no

01:55:02.520 --> 01:55:09.840
Fix your toe, girl, you've got a camel toe Mm-hmm, that's right, uh-huh, oh, no

01:55:09.840 --> 01:55:17.240
Fix your toe, girl, you've got a camel toe First I explain by the looks of things These girls don't forgot how to dress

01:55:17.240 --> 01:55:21.000
A little too quick, wearin' a pool comin' for us This is causin' me much distress

01:55:21.000 --> 01:55:24.440
Won't say it is alright, that's fine Everybody tryna get a good look

01:55:24.440 --> 01:55:28.200
I can see everything through the panty-cling Every cranny and every nook

01:55:28.200 --> 01:55:30.200
Better stay quick, let me tell you something fine

01:55:30.200 --> 01:55:32.200
Check the area, it's pubic

01:55:32.200 --> 01:55:34.200
And you get your pain drawn up in the blood

01:55:34.200 --> 01:55:36.200
So twist it up like Rubik's

01:55:36.200 --> 01:55:38.200
Say words to your vice, it's not getting nice

01:55:38.200 --> 01:55:40.200
Let me put you on and we know

01:55:40.200 --> 01:55:41.200
Girls don't sleep unless you feel sleep

01:55:41.200 --> 01:55:43.200
Watch out for the camel toe

01:55:43.200 --> 01:55:45.200
Mm-hmm, that's right

01:55:45.200 --> 01:55:47.200
Uh-huh, I don't know

01:55:47.200 --> 01:55:50.200
Think you so, girl, you got a camel toe

01:55:50.200 --> 01:55:52.200
Mm-hmm, that's right

01:55:52.200 --> 01:55:54.200
Uh-huh, I don't know

01:55:54.200 --> 01:55:57.200
Think you so, girl, you got a camel toe

01:55:57.200 --> 01:56:23.300
Alright, that was the last song in tonight's cage match.

01:56:23.300 --> 01:56:26.180
My pick, Fanny Pack with Camel Toe.

01:56:26.180 --> 01:56:31.820
ice queen for picking that one out for me Jamie that was so ghetto booty oh my

01:56:31.820 --> 01:56:36.320
god Rob alright you need to be spanked for that song

01:56:36.320 --> 01:56:42.500
ooh not by me though we'll talk to somebody who's not here tonight okay

01:56:42.500 --> 01:56:49.500
on a scale of one to ten I don't think that numbers can quantify it it gets a

01:56:49.500 --> 01:56:54.620
it gets a beef of booty all right I guess it translates to an eight okay

01:56:54.620 --> 01:57:01.460
Aaron I don't know the first time I've heard something like that in a while

01:57:01.460 --> 01:57:08.500
yeah I guess you have a new term for that type of thing and things besides

01:57:08.500 --> 01:57:15.980
saying that girls wear their pants too tight these days and I give it an 8 because that was a good laugh

01:57:15.980 --> 01:57:17.980
Alright, 8 for a good laugh.

01:57:17.980 --> 01:57:19.980
Tuppy!

01:57:21.980 --> 01:57:28.980
Just the fact that the name of the song is Camel Toe is ridiculous to itself.

01:57:28.980 --> 01:57:31.980
I mean, come on. What next?

01:57:31.980 --> 01:57:36.980
I mean, next thing you know there's going to be a song called Blue Balls.

01:57:36.980 --> 01:57:39.980
There may well be.

01:57:39.980 --> 01:57:42.980
Jamie's threatening to write it right now.

01:57:42.980 --> 01:57:50.980
The next remix I make will be, insert song name here, The Blues Ball Mix.

01:57:50.980 --> 01:57:53.980
Ooh, it'd be even better if it was a blues song.

01:57:53.980 --> 01:57:55.980
Let Puppy finish his thought.

01:57:55.980 --> 01:57:58.980
There's a thought?

01:57:58.980 --> 01:57:59.980
He has to give a number.

01:57:59.980 --> 01:58:02.980
I didn't know I would.

01:58:02.980 --> 01:58:03.980
3.159.

01:58:03.980 --> 01:58:04.980
Alright.

01:58:04.980 --> 01:58:05.980
Uh, Bradley.

01:58:05.980 --> 01:58:06.980
This is good.

01:58:06.980 --> 01:58:10.980
I'm still thinking.

01:58:10.980 --> 01:58:14.980
Ghetto booty. Booty ghetto.

01:58:14.980 --> 01:58:18.980
Let's just...

01:58:18.980 --> 01:58:22.980
Let's give it a seven. Or an eight. Or a four. Or a three. Or a seven. Or a twenty.

01:58:22.980 --> 01:58:26.980
Or a nine. Or nothing.

01:58:26.980 --> 01:58:30.980
Best song ever! Ten. Loki.

01:58:30.980 --> 01:58:34.980
Um.

01:58:34.980 --> 01:58:43.980
Yeah. You know, the white in me says seven, but the ghetto black in me says ten.

01:58:43.980 --> 01:58:46.980
So what's that average to? 9.9?

01:58:46.980 --> 01:58:53.980
Uh...er...nine? Wait. Nine and a half.

01:58:53.980 --> 01:58:55.980
Alright.

01:58:55.980 --> 01:58:59.980
Okay, here we go. Let's recap. And I'll...

01:58:59.980 --> 01:59:04.480
Well, for those of you that haven't voted before, you have to send a private message to me in the chat room.

01:59:04.480 --> 01:59:08.480
You have to send it over a private message or it doesn't count. If you say it publicly in the room, it doesn't count.

01:59:08.480 --> 01:59:14.980
And I know we have some new chatters in there tonight, so I'll type out how you do that for those of you that don't know.

01:59:14.980 --> 01:59:17.480
And sorry, but you can't vote for Hollick.

01:59:17.480 --> 01:59:19.980
All right, let's recap, shall we, real fast.

01:59:19.980 --> 01:59:20.980
Why do people even bother?

01:59:20.980 --> 01:59:24.980
Song number one, last week's winner, Free Fall, featuring Jams Johnston with Skydive.

01:59:24.980 --> 01:59:38.320
All right, song number two that you can vote for tonight is Yumi Hamasaki from Cybertrance

01:59:38.320 --> 01:59:50.980
3 with a song called Naturally.

01:59:50.980 --> 01:59:54.280
Song number three you can vote for tonight is a band called Fanny Pack with the song

01:59:54.280 --> 01:59:55.280
Camel Toe.

01:59:55.280 --> 02:00:07.400
I wonder what's gonna win.

02:00:07.400 --> 02:00:08.400
Vote now.

02:00:08.400 --> 02:00:13.640
Place vote now.

02:00:13.640 --> 02:00:20.040
In the meantime, Loki, why don't you tell us what's going on in the Sim world?

02:00:20.040 --> 02:00:23.160
Some piece of wire doesn't want to go through my hole.

02:00:23.160 --> 02:00:25.200
Anyways, in the controller.

02:00:25.200 --> 02:00:26.440
Hole in the controller.

02:00:29.440 --> 02:00:32.560
Now, there's a new StepMania version.

02:00:32.560 --> 02:00:37.320
And they did stuff, and stuff happened, and yeah.

02:00:37.320 --> 02:00:38.920
Don't care.

02:00:38.920 --> 02:00:41.920
Also, oh wait, I know you're going to love this.

02:00:41.920 --> 02:00:48.400
New TourneyMix, TourneyMix 4th Plus, it's a DDR joke.

02:00:48.400 --> 02:00:54.040
OK, anyways, yeah, DDR-EI, or East Coast Invasions,

02:00:54.040 --> 02:00:56.600
Turny Mix, Fourth Plus, Asian Mix.

02:00:56.600 --> 02:00:57.480
What?

02:00:57.480 --> 02:00:59.800
Asian, I kid you not, Asian Mix.

02:00:59.800 --> 02:01:03.000
All the music in it must be sung by an Asian singer.

02:01:03.000 --> 02:01:07.480
So it has to be in Japanese or Chinese, Korean.

02:01:07.480 --> 02:01:09.760
They're trying to control the track.

02:01:09.760 --> 02:01:15.640
It's trying to, they're trying to basically spark

02:01:15.640 --> 02:01:17.520
interest for Turny Mix 5.

02:01:17.520 --> 02:01:25.520
So basically, this is going to be the poorly run stepchild that's in the middle.

02:01:25.520 --> 02:01:29.520
For this Asian mix, there better be really, really good Japanese or Korean songs,

02:01:29.520 --> 02:01:37.520
because we all know where Chinese pop went, or is going.

02:01:37.520 --> 02:01:44.520
But it seems like, judging from the last remix, a lot of people don't have that good a song taste.

02:01:44.520 --> 02:01:50.520
You know, technically you can have Russian music too, because part of Russia is in Asia, so we can have tattoo!

02:01:55.520 --> 02:02:06.520
But yeah, and obviously, the only good Chinese songs there are, are basically slow songs and some trance slash techno, but not much.

02:02:07.520 --> 02:02:10.520
Oh, I haven't listened to Thai pop so, not very much.

02:02:10.520 --> 02:02:17.360
Yeah, India's in Asia too, so dollar-mendy all around.

02:02:17.360 --> 02:02:18.360
Tunac.

02:02:18.360 --> 02:02:21.120
Was this mentioned in the chatroom?

02:02:21.120 --> 02:02:22.120
Tunac, Tunac.

02:02:22.120 --> 02:02:24.840
Oh, get over, Tunac, Tunac, already.

02:02:24.840 --> 02:02:25.840
Come on.

02:02:25.840 --> 02:02:27.320
That song is fucking used.

02:02:27.320 --> 02:02:28.320
It's done.

02:02:28.320 --> 02:02:33.280
Hello, and welcome to a joke that is fucking moldy.

02:02:33.280 --> 02:02:34.280
It's done.

02:02:34.280 --> 02:02:36.280
I'm sick of Tunac, Tunac.

02:02:36.280 --> 02:02:38.560
Bring out my pogs.

02:02:38.560 --> 02:02:39.560
Yeah.

02:02:39.560 --> 02:02:45.060
Let's play Magic the Gathering and listen to our, you know, Lilith Fair music while we, you know...

02:02:45.060 --> 02:02:46.560
You mean Dungeons and Dragons?

02:02:46.560 --> 02:02:48.560
Yeah, play Dungeons and Dragons to neck to neck.

02:02:48.560 --> 02:02:50.560
7 Mary 3 and Bush.

02:02:50.560 --> 02:02:57.560
Yeah, while we listen to 7 Mary 3 and Bush and watch MTV playing music videos.

02:02:57.560 --> 02:03:00.060
All day long.

02:03:00.060 --> 02:03:05.060
Anyway, I agree that Trinity Makes 4 Plus is a stupid idea. Talk about unnecessary things.

02:03:05.060 --> 02:03:07.560
I mean, honestly.

02:03:07.560 --> 02:03:13.560
I mean, what useless songs are going to come out of this, honestly?

02:03:13.560 --> 02:03:14.560
It's horrid.

02:03:14.560 --> 02:03:15.560
I know.

02:03:15.560 --> 02:03:17.720
We're going to see a gazillion Ayumi songs.

02:03:17.720 --> 02:03:23.720
And if you think I'm going to jump off my ass to make you your stupid Max 2 USA license

02:03:23.720 --> 02:03:25.080
tracks, think again.

02:03:25.080 --> 02:03:29.180
I don't care, because I haven't played StepMania in three months, and I am not going to make

02:03:29.180 --> 02:03:30.180
your stupid tracks.

02:03:30.180 --> 02:03:36.440
So you're going to have to wait for DDRUK to make them, because they're good at everything.

02:03:36.440 --> 02:03:38.440
Even though I made them the last two times, and they took credit!

02:03:38.440 --> 02:03:40.440
Took credit!

02:03:40.440 --> 02:03:42.440
Because they said, oh, they were out of sync!

02:03:42.440 --> 02:03:44.440
YOU'RE out of sync!

02:03:44.440 --> 02:03:46.440
I'm done.

02:03:48.440 --> 02:03:54.440
It's not just the Yumi songs, there's probably gonna be a lot of stupid Pop, Finkle, SES, Shinwa songs.

02:03:54.440 --> 02:03:57.440
Last call for cage match votes in the chat room.

02:03:57.440 --> 02:03:59.440
I have a challenge to issue.

02:03:59.440 --> 02:04:02.440
I want Dragon Ash or MaliceMizer.

02:04:02.440 --> 02:04:10.440
I would love to see some visual kei done, or I would love to see just some good, you

02:04:10.440 --> 02:04:14.600
know, uber goth j-rock make it into the turning mix.

02:04:14.600 --> 02:04:16.440
See how they pull that off.

02:04:16.440 --> 02:04:22.000
Like, you know, have like the Beasts of Blood video playing in the background or something.

02:04:22.000 --> 02:04:24.480
Here's the microphone!

02:04:24.480 --> 02:04:29.920
What am I going to do with it?

02:04:29.920 --> 02:04:30.920
Like this?

02:04:30.920 --> 02:04:41.320
Alright, would you guys like to hear who got the cage match tonight because we have collected

02:04:41.320 --> 02:04:42.320
all the votes.

02:04:42.320 --> 02:04:43.320
I gave the last call.

02:04:43.320 --> 02:04:44.320
Wow.

02:04:44.320 --> 02:04:45.320
Sure.

02:04:45.320 --> 02:04:47.600
Yeah, I just try to wrap it up quick now because we tend to do FUs and cage match back to back

02:04:47.600 --> 02:04:51.640
and I have to close out all the private messages for FUs as if you needed to know that.

02:04:51.640 --> 02:04:54.440
So here we go, I haven't gotten any more votes.

02:04:54.440 --> 02:04:58.400
So here is tonight's winner, are you guys ready for it?

02:04:58.400 --> 02:05:01.640
It is a tie.

02:05:01.640 --> 02:05:02.600
Oh, lovely.

02:05:02.600 --> 02:05:05.560
Dun, dun, dun.

02:05:05.560 --> 02:05:06.680
No.

02:05:06.680 --> 02:05:10.480
The way the rules go is that the host whose song did not tie

02:05:10.480 --> 02:05:12.080
will break the tie.

02:05:12.080 --> 02:05:21.680
And tonight, song one, song one that tied was Camel Toe.

02:05:21.680 --> 02:05:23.800
Figures.

02:05:23.800 --> 02:05:30.080
Song number two that tied tonight was, if the damn thing will play.

02:05:30.080 --> 02:05:31.080
Let me guess, Yumi?

02:05:31.080 --> 02:05:32.080
Yes, it was Yumi.

02:05:32.080 --> 02:05:38.660
So it means Yumi is swimming out and she gets to break the tie, and hopefully she remembers

02:05:38.660 --> 02:05:44.700
the favor I gave her last week, but not to influence her vote or anything.

02:05:44.700 --> 02:05:46.380
Give it to the butt.

02:05:46.380 --> 02:05:47.380
Give it to the booty.

02:05:47.380 --> 02:05:48.380
Give it to the booty.

02:05:48.380 --> 02:05:49.380
All right.

02:05:49.380 --> 02:06:02.180
is this week's cage match winner so camel toe wins by a vote of one. I also call that

02:06:02.180 --> 02:06:07.460
needs the F.U. music for the chat room okay that will be the F.U. music for the chat room

02:06:07.460 --> 02:06:15.860
tonight that's fine okay if you want to if you want to visit our webcam www.calibomani.com

02:06:15.860 --> 02:06:19.000
click on orange lounge and click on chat. The site you can see on the cam right now

02:06:19.000 --> 02:06:24.980
is puppy hunched over with a microphone, Loki soldering in the background. Erin has been

02:06:24.980 --> 02:06:29.920
on and off the cam. Jamie's hiding from it. Jamie hides from the cam so she randomly holds

02:06:29.920 --> 02:06:38.680
objects up. Alright, guess what's coming up when we take this break kids? After this break.

02:06:38.680 --> 02:06:44.480
Come on, we do it every week. FUs. We all know it, why do we have to guess? Because

02:06:44.480 --> 02:06:45.480
It's the fun part.

02:06:45.480 --> 02:06:46.480
Alright.

02:06:46.480 --> 02:06:47.480
Give me.

02:06:47.480 --> 02:06:48.480
Yes, Jamie?

02:06:48.480 --> 02:06:50.160
I have a microphone now, so just play my damn music.

02:06:50.160 --> 02:06:51.160
Well, we're not doing any FUs yet.

02:06:51.160 --> 02:06:52.160
We're taking a break first.

02:06:52.160 --> 02:06:53.160
I don't care.

02:06:53.160 --> 02:06:54.160
Alright.

02:06:54.160 --> 02:06:59.240
Uh, in this break, we're going to hear more Max 2 USA music, and this is a lot of songs.

02:06:59.240 --> 02:07:00.240
You know what?

02:07:00.240 --> 02:07:01.240
What?

02:07:01.240 --> 02:07:03.520
I don't understand why they don't just let me pick all the music.

02:07:03.520 --> 02:07:04.520
What do you mean?

02:07:04.520 --> 02:07:05.520
For Max 2?

02:07:05.520 --> 02:07:06.520
No.

02:07:06.520 --> 02:07:07.520
I don't like in general.

02:07:07.520 --> 02:07:10.600
I should, like, petition Konami to let me pick everything.

02:07:10.600 --> 02:07:17.260
The only thing that some of the songs are good for being picked for is like picking

02:07:17.260 --> 02:07:18.260
noses.

02:07:18.260 --> 02:07:19.260
I don't know.

02:07:19.260 --> 02:07:21.700
They're all really good songs though, so go ahead and play them.

02:07:21.700 --> 02:07:23.220
Alright, here we go.

02:07:23.220 --> 02:07:25.620
In this break you're going to hear a lot of songs that were requested.

02:07:25.620 --> 02:07:33.100
Tomorrow Perfume in this break, Will I, and SFMP with Try To Love You.

02:07:33.100 --> 02:07:34.560
You're listening to Orange Lombs Radio.

02:07:34.560 --> 02:07:37.000
Tell a friend we're on the air.

02:07:37.000 --> 02:07:39.500
We'll be back after this.

02:07:39.500 --> 02:07:40.500
Thanks.

02:09:09.500 --> 02:09:39.000
You don't know what fucking for, from the fucking one you know

02:09:39.000 --> 02:09:40.440
Coming like the bass real low

02:09:40.440 --> 02:09:42.040
Trips, the tracks, the trips, the track, the track

02:09:42.040 --> 02:09:43.720
A weak weapon, acting like a fake lady

02:09:43.720 --> 02:09:45.400
Get down from the tip of the ear

02:09:45.400 --> 02:09:47.480
You can't lose me, baby, it's my world

02:09:47.480 --> 02:09:49.560
Cause I ain't nothing like a punk, the sister girl

02:09:49.560 --> 02:09:51.320
The motivation gets you, hits you where it hurts

02:09:51.320 --> 02:09:53.400
Yeah, it's the first time in real life, just the first time in real life

02:09:53.400 --> 02:09:55.400
You're my favorite sister

02:09:55.400 --> 02:09:57.400
I'm just trying to love you

02:09:57.400 --> 02:10:01.400
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

02:10:01.400 --> 02:10:03.400
Why don't you show me

02:10:03.400 --> 02:10:05.400
I'm just trying to love you

02:10:35.400 --> 02:10:39.400
I ever loved you again

02:10:41.400 --> 02:10:46.400
Will we be together again?

02:10:48.400 --> 02:10:52.400
Thought the love we had was strong

02:10:54.400 --> 02:10:57.400
Tell me what's wrong

02:10:57.400 --> 02:11:00.400
Where did we go wrong?

02:11:27.400 --> 02:11:43.400
Will I, Will I, Will I Will I, Will I, Will I, Will I, Will I

02:11:43.400 --> 02:11:56.400
Will I ever love you again Will we be together again

02:11:56.400 --> 02:12:02.400
Sorry, the one we had was strong

02:12:02.400 --> 02:12:05.400
And tell me what's wrong

02:12:35.400 --> 02:12:49.560
Bitch, get a new song, an open letter from Orange Lounge Radio.

02:12:49.560 --> 02:12:54.480
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio episode number 62 in progress.

02:12:54.480 --> 02:12:57.720
And Jamie, do you know what time it is?

02:12:57.720 --> 02:12:58.720
Fuck you.

02:12:58.720 --> 02:13:00.720
Actually, I don't have the music queued up yet.

02:13:00.720 --> 02:13:05.560
You're supposed to take longer than that to answer the question.

02:13:05.560 --> 02:13:08.080
It's time for me to throw a ferret at Puppy.

02:13:08.080 --> 02:13:09.080
Alright.

02:13:09.080 --> 02:13:10.560
Okay, now I'm ready.

02:13:10.560 --> 02:13:12.160
Jamie, what time is it?

02:13:12.160 --> 02:13:13.160
I don't care.

02:13:13.160 --> 02:13:14.160
Come on.

02:13:14.160 --> 02:13:15.160
Uh-uh, you're no fun.

02:13:15.160 --> 02:13:16.160
You weren't ready.

02:13:16.160 --> 02:13:17.160
Jamie.

02:13:17.160 --> 02:13:22.200
It's time for me to get a ferret thrown at my hand.

02:13:22.200 --> 02:13:25.200
Stop throwing ferret at Nate!

02:13:25.200 --> 02:13:26.200
Oh, this is bad.

02:13:26.200 --> 02:13:27.200
Here is justice.

02:13:27.200 --> 02:13:28.200
Here is luck.

02:13:28.200 --> 02:13:29.200
Oh, no!

02:13:29.200 --> 02:13:30.200
Look at the camera!

02:13:30.200 --> 02:13:31.200
This is fucked up.

02:13:31.200 --> 02:13:32.200
Camera, away from me!

02:13:32.200 --> 02:13:33.200
No!

02:13:33.200 --> 02:13:34.200
Put it back where it was.

02:13:34.200 --> 02:13:35.200
Ahem.

02:13:35.200 --> 02:13:36.200
No, put it back the way it was!

02:13:36.200 --> 02:13:37.200
Okay.

02:13:37.200 --> 02:13:38.200
Ahem.

02:13:38.200 --> 02:13:39.200
Oh, yeah.

02:13:39.200 --> 02:13:52.320
It's time for me to be angsty, huh?

02:13:52.320 --> 02:13:56.440
I haven't really had that bad of a week, but okay, stop that.

02:13:56.440 --> 02:14:05.560
First off, a big F-you goes to puppy for throwing a ferret at my boob, and for throwing a ferret

02:14:05.560 --> 02:14:07.520
at violent hyper girl's ass.

02:14:07.520 --> 02:14:09.040
You threw it.

02:14:09.040 --> 02:14:14.120
But you were the target, so it's your fault.

02:14:14.120 --> 02:14:16.240
Your fault for...stop it.

02:14:16.240 --> 02:14:17.240
Okay.

02:14:17.240 --> 02:14:22.240
Another one goes for the rice I was cooking for being too wet.

02:14:22.240 --> 02:14:27.240
That's my fault because I put in too much water.

02:14:27.240 --> 02:14:32.240
I can't help it, the rice is just so hot.

02:14:32.240 --> 02:14:37.240
And it couldn't help being moist because I was touching it.

02:14:37.240 --> 02:14:42.240
I was rolling it around and making balls with it.

02:14:42.240 --> 02:14:52.240
Anyway, another F.E. goes to being hot, because I am right now.

02:14:52.240 --> 02:14:57.040
Another one goes toward my laundry for not being dry, so I'm drying it again.

02:14:57.040 --> 02:15:05.240
Another F.E. goes toward ferret sex.

02:15:05.240 --> 02:15:13.360
if he goes toward all the people who are not signed up for my message board it's

02:15:13.360 --> 02:15:17.280
roleplay that's our soccer.com

02:15:20.280 --> 02:15:25.240
I think I'm gonna throw out of our way I want to form a sexual place sexual role

02:15:25.240 --> 02:15:28.760
play on there I'm gonna make it hidden for all of you people who are into the

02:15:28.760 --> 02:15:34.720
kinky crap if there's gonna be one for four tops and one for bottoms and then

02:16:04.720 --> 02:16:09.040
the whole time here I was like okay you can get off you are not a hemorrhoid I

02:16:09.040 --> 02:16:19.360
am too young you know and then really I think that's about it oh yeah I think if

02:16:19.360 --> 02:16:24.120
you go through my sleep pattern which is gonna hopefully be corrected and I got a

02:16:24.120 --> 02:16:35.120
really cool hat okay bye all right next up is Loki yeah anyways I think I'm

02:16:35.120 --> 02:16:41.480
wrapped around you here okay yeah I'm trying to get to my first F you here I

02:16:41.480 --> 02:16:48.320
just have to find something there it is okay can you turn down the music like

02:16:48.320 --> 02:16:58.940
off. First F you of the week goes to Konami. Mainly the group System SF. I don't know who

02:16:58.940 --> 02:17:04.340
the fuck you think you are, but I don't like you blatantly ripping off other songs. Really

02:17:04.340 --> 02:17:11.980
I don't. This piracy stuff has to stop. Now, the song I'm going to play for you is by another

02:17:11.980 --> 02:17:18.860
group with a very similar name to System SF. It's called System F. They predated you

02:17:18.860 --> 02:17:24.540
by five years. So here's their song and it's also their very big hit song called Out of

02:17:24.540 --> 02:17:31.540
the blue. See if this sounds familiar.

02:17:54.540 --> 02:18:19.700
It's freaking feelings won't fade you goddamn retard you didn't do anything to change the

02:18:19.700 --> 02:18:24.300
song at all you blatantly stole it you can't say that you covered it because well there's

02:18:24.300 --> 02:18:27.180
There's no scene, so you suck.

02:18:27.180 --> 02:18:28.820
Come up with some original shit.

02:18:28.820 --> 02:18:32.320
I'm sure Look to the Skies will probably rip off of something else, but I have to find

02:18:32.320 --> 02:18:33.320
it first.

02:18:33.320 --> 02:18:35.460
So you're lucky for now.

02:18:35.460 --> 02:18:39.700
I'm about to expose you.

02:18:39.700 --> 02:18:44.700
But anyways, yes, I am very pissed off at the fact that you blatantly ripped off Out

02:18:44.700 --> 02:18:45.700
of the Blue.

02:18:45.700 --> 02:18:51.780
So that's enough of that, and sorry about the Bawani Cell thing.

02:18:51.780 --> 02:18:56.060
F.U. them for having their god damn music on their front page. I hate that god damn

02:18:56.060 --> 02:19:02.720
music. Be like DDRMania X and keep it turned off unless I want it turned on. Or changes

02:19:02.720 --> 02:19:07.720
to something else, you know, something catchy. Also, F.U.

02:19:07.720 --> 02:19:11.920
One little comment, sorry. I thought that the whole deal of having music play on your

02:19:11.920 --> 02:19:16.600
main page went out when people stopped using GeoCities.

02:19:16.600 --> 02:19:20.520
Well it came back with people using Flash on their pages.

02:19:20.520 --> 02:19:26.080
came back with Zenga and Shockwave actually say but anyways no but my cell

02:19:26.080 --> 02:19:31.720
rocks other than their little music change the music you can be perfect fu

02:19:31.720 --> 02:19:42.120
for must be first off for the stages at RV GL still being kind of slanted

02:19:42.120 --> 02:19:58.120
FU the stupid drivers because I hate you everywhere, and there's all types of drivers and I think

02:19:58.120 --> 02:20:03.960
I yelled at you all today, you know, whether it be, you know, the stupid Asian person that

02:20:03.960 --> 02:20:04.960
had the...

02:20:04.960 --> 02:20:05.960
It's Asian women mothers!

02:20:05.960 --> 02:20:12.960
I don't know. Anyways, this stupid guy who has the rice rocket thing, or not really a rice rocket, but it sounded like...

02:20:12.960 --> 02:20:13.960
The fart cannon!

02:20:13.960 --> 02:20:15.960
Yes, it sounded like the fart cannon.

02:20:15.960 --> 02:20:18.960
The fart cannon and the bleacher.

02:20:18.960 --> 02:20:21.960
And, uh, F.U. to like...

02:20:21.960 --> 02:20:28.960
You have to quote Jahi on this one. A hole in your muffler does not make a modification.

02:20:28.960 --> 02:20:39.960
No, but anyways, um, FU2, uh, I don't know. I got thrown off when people started talking.

02:20:40.960 --> 02:20:47.960
Um, oh, I know. FU2 is a stupid bitch that, like, ran over a curb at work.

02:20:47.960 --> 02:20:58.960
It totally shattered it all and now my friend's probably going to get blamed for it because they have a giant bus and it's going to look like the bus ran over it even though it's a delivery man so that kind of sucks.

02:20:58.960 --> 02:21:08.960
Fuck you the G4 because you still suck. You haven't heeded any of my advice and you can burn in hell.

02:21:08.960 --> 02:21:12.960
You don't even have any new programming. You're talking about what happened at E3.

02:21:12.960 --> 02:21:22.960
Okay, E3's been over for a while now, okay? E3 is not breaking news, okay?

02:21:22.960 --> 02:21:28.960
And to say that you have new daily content is a lie anyways, because you film your shows like once every month.

02:21:28.960 --> 02:21:32.960
And then repeat them over and over and over and over and over again.

02:21:32.960 --> 02:21:39.960
So, playing full motion video, or not necessarily full motion video, but playing video game

02:21:39.960 --> 02:21:43.960
screenshots to music does not constitute a show.

02:21:43.960 --> 02:21:45.960
So please stop.

02:21:45.960 --> 02:21:51.960
And, um, what's that like?

02:21:51.960 --> 02:21:54.960
They're eating Mike and Ikes with chopsticks.

02:21:54.960 --> 02:21:56.960
Stop being Asian.

02:21:56.960 --> 02:21:58.960
I don't think she can help that.

02:21:58.960 --> 02:22:01.960
Stop talking about puppies.

02:22:01.960 --> 02:22:20.960
But, um, uh, yeah, I don't know, um, FU to our racist neighbor, and, uh, I'm done. I don't have anything to bitch about right now, cause it's been coming to me, it's just like, yeah.

02:22:20.960 --> 02:22:26.960
All right. My turn.

02:22:26.960 --> 02:22:28.960
This song makes me want to eat some beef.

02:22:28.960 --> 02:22:35.960
My FUs are pretty quick this week. FU to the fact that everything in this goddamn town closes so early. I hate that shit.

02:22:35.960 --> 02:22:41.960
And I know I've said FU about this before, but I'm saying it again because it's still true. This town sucks.

02:22:41.960 --> 02:22:48.960
So that's my first FU. My second FU goes to two things that happened in San Francisco.

02:22:48.960 --> 02:22:59.160
There's the Wholesome Street Fair, which happened today, and the Castro Street Fair, which happens

02:22:59.160 --> 02:23:00.160
next Sunday.

02:23:00.160 --> 02:23:02.820
Why does this shit happen on a Sunday?

02:23:02.820 --> 02:23:05.880
I can't go if you have this stuff on a Sunday.

02:23:05.880 --> 02:23:08.160
Have it on a Saturday, you suck.

02:23:08.160 --> 02:23:11.960
And your town is dirty, and I know a lot of people live in San Francisco, it's like our

02:23:11.960 --> 02:23:18.240
number one market in San Francisco, but you know what, the town is dirty.

02:23:18.240 --> 02:23:24.240
I'm sure it's not you guys that listen to Orange Lawn's radio to make it dirty. It's the other million people living there. We can't pick up their trash.

02:23:24.240 --> 02:23:26.240
It's gross. Frisco's a gross city.

02:23:26.240 --> 02:23:28.240
Oh my god, do a million people really live in San Francisco?

02:23:28.240 --> 02:23:32.240
I think it's actually 700,000, but I'm counting the surrounding area a little bit too.

02:23:32.240 --> 02:23:34.240
That's why I'm glad I don't live there.

02:23:34.240 --> 02:23:40.240
Alright, so, yeah. Screw you, San Francisco, and your stupid planning.

02:23:40.240 --> 02:23:46.240
Alright, uh, rest of the room's turn. Let's start with Puppy.

02:23:46.240 --> 02:23:53.240
Oh, I almost did not catch the mic.

02:23:53.240 --> 02:23:58.240
Are we having like a porn DVD slideshow on the camera or something?

02:23:58.240 --> 02:24:00.240
Ahem, eff you.

02:24:00.240 --> 02:24:07.240
Okay, um, fuck you to class starting because it's class and that's just the way it is.

02:24:07.240 --> 02:24:15.240
And um, fuck you to my bike for like being really crappy.

02:24:15.240 --> 02:24:19.880

Yeah, okay, uh, fuck you to general stupidity, especially when it's my own.

02:24:56.560 --> 02:24:58.560

02:25:36.880 --> 02:25:37.600

02:25:41.200 --> 02:25:43.280

02:25:43.280 --> 02:25:48.840
I don't have a lot this week actually, but fuck you goes to whoever broke the wheel

02:25:48.840 --> 02:25:53.080

thanks to you it no longer has the 270 degrees in either direction yes it spins

02:25:59.960 --> 02:26:04.520
freely it's just like RTA all over again and I think I know I think it was one of

02:26:04.520 --> 02:26:08.640
those fat teeny bop fat like high school teeny boppers I saw there on like Friday

02:26:08.640 --> 02:26:16.200
afternoon so I'm not for sure oh no it wasn't broken trust me it wasn't but

02:26:16.200 --> 02:26:20.200
Was it? I was there on Friday morning and you didn't care about it.

02:26:20.200 --> 02:26:23.200
No, I was there before that, I think. Not ever.

02:26:23.200 --> 02:26:26.200
But, um, let's see.

02:26:26.200 --> 02:26:31.200
Fuck you goes to Workload English 57 for being exactly like high school.

02:26:31.200 --> 02:26:37.200
I don't like group work, I don't like the teacher, and I hate it and I want to get out of there as fast as possible.

02:26:37.200 --> 02:26:39.200
Um...

02:26:39.200 --> 02:26:47.200
Fuck you goes to the, uh, stupid neighbors who live outside me who are always either laughing at music or trying to be ghetto thugs.

02:26:48.200 --> 02:26:51.200
See yourselves for once. Come on now.

02:26:51.200 --> 02:26:56.200
They aren't ghetto thugs. They're kinda actual ghetto thugs.

02:26:56.200 --> 02:26:59.200
And...

02:26:59.200 --> 02:27:03.200
I can't really think of any... much.

02:27:03.200 --> 02:27:11.200
Oh yeah, and uh, fuck you to that stupid skillet that my parents gave me that doesn't actually work, it just happens to burn everything that you put in it.

02:27:11.200 --> 02:27:16.200
Because it's metal and it's not cast iron. So yeah.

02:27:16.200 --> 02:27:23.200
Alright, let's move on and see what our chat room has to say, shall we?

02:27:23.200 --> 02:27:33.200
Brack2000 would like to say F you to overloaded the Lesson 2 song, not being a real DDR Max 2 song, and only a stupid Lesson Mode song.

02:27:34.200 --> 02:27:36.200
Uh oh, VHD needs to respond to something in the chair.

02:27:37.200 --> 02:27:48.200
Someone asked why I'm in workload English. It's because I got cocky on my subject A and I didn't put a thesis in my essay, so now I'm stuck there and I've ruined some of those cold idiots, basically, except for two people that I became friends with.

02:27:48.200 --> 02:27:54.200
So yeah, that was an error on my part, but God, the teacher could be able to tell you that.

02:28:18.200 --> 02:28:23.200
Fuck my QX949 for its bad mid-left front channel capacitator.

02:28:23.200 --> 02:28:27.200
Capacitor, sorry. I read that wrong. Sorry.

02:28:27.200 --> 02:28:31.200
Fuck my terrible C++ compiler.

02:28:31.200 --> 02:28:39.200
Fuck the guy who sold me a wireless PS2 controller and just cut the cord off the regular controller.

02:28:39.200 --> 02:28:42.200
That's great.

02:28:42.200 --> 02:28:44.200
low-key was that you?

02:28:44.200 --> 02:28:46.200
No.

02:28:46.200 --> 02:28:48.200
I wouldn't have cut it out.

02:28:48.200 --> 02:28:50.200
Biohazard also says,

02:28:50.200 --> 02:28:52.200
Fuck my jellybean tin having a

02:28:52.200 --> 02:28:54.200
finite supply on Jelly Bellies.

02:28:54.200 --> 02:28:56.200
Fuck HAPP

02:28:56.200 --> 02:28:58.200
controllers for wanting

02:28:58.200 --> 02:29:00.200
$12.99 for a 2DX style button.

02:29:00.200 --> 02:29:02.200
Fuck peeps who talk

02:29:02.200 --> 02:29:04.200
like this. This is Asian writing.

02:29:04.200 --> 02:29:06.200
I'm sorry, AZN writing.

02:29:06.200 --> 02:29:08.200
And expect me to read it.

02:29:08.200 --> 02:29:10.200
Fuck really negative people.

02:29:10.200 --> 02:29:33.200
Just pay the money for the half-controls button, I bought like 16 of them, get over it!

02:29:33.200 --> 02:29:37.200
H.K. Holly, Aaron would like to read this for you.

02:29:37.200 --> 02:29:44.200
This is mostly an inside joke from Cali Bhimani, but fuck you green vaginal ooze.

02:29:44.200 --> 02:29:50.200
Beautiful. Vaginal ooze is funny when it's green too.

02:29:50.200 --> 02:29:52.200
Boy oh boy.

02:29:52.200 --> 02:29:57.200
23rd Magus would like to say, F you to Angel's fucked up work schedule. She misses the show again.

02:29:57.200 --> 02:30:02.200
F you to forgetting to wake my dad up in time to get a ride to the show. You missed food.

02:30:02.200 --> 02:30:05.200
I am to suck. No comment.

02:30:05.200 --> 02:30:11.200
F you to hatching a pouring egg, naming it, giving it a backpack, and then forgetting to feed it. 20k down the hole.

02:30:11.200 --> 02:30:12.200
That's a Ragnarok reference.

02:30:12.200 --> 02:30:24.200
And once again, fuck the lammers on Ragnarok Online. Please. Or PLZ. What's a PLZ? Oh, you want me to heal the monster you're fighting? Okay.

02:30:24.200 --> 02:30:28.200
I have an F you. I don't know if you just said it because I was in the bathroom.

02:30:28.200 --> 02:30:37.140
I hate you all and I hope that your computers explode and you all catch stars in the ass.

02:30:37.140 --> 02:30:40.140
Thank you.

02:30:40.140 --> 02:30:43.060
Chaos says F you to heartburn.

02:30:43.060 --> 02:30:45.700
That's it.

02:30:45.700 --> 02:30:46.700
Heartburn does suck.

02:30:46.700 --> 02:30:48.660
I hate it.

02:30:48.660 --> 02:30:52.700
No Stylin says my F you of the week is paying bills.

02:30:52.700 --> 02:30:56.720
It's like you have bills and you pay them off and you have more of them and you wonder

02:30:56.720 --> 02:30:57.820
where the hell they came from.

02:30:57.820 --> 02:31:01.820
So I go, huh, you pay bills and more come. What's up with that?

02:31:01.820 --> 02:31:05.760
I find how once you get money, it's gone in a second. So yeah, screw the government, screw

02:31:05.760 --> 02:31:10.260
Dave and Gray Davis and this whole recall thing and screw expensive schools that try

02:31:10.260 --> 02:31:15.940
to rip you off with name brand products which you don't have.

02:31:15.940 --> 02:31:18.300
Screw you to the recall, the government and the recall?

02:31:18.300 --> 02:31:19.300
Yes.

02:31:19.300 --> 02:31:20.740
One or the other?

02:31:20.740 --> 02:31:23.740
Screw you to anything involving the recall. Just go away.

02:31:23.740 --> 02:31:24.740
Okay.

02:31:24.740 --> 02:31:25.740
It involves him.

02:31:25.740 --> 02:31:33.740
Tal would like to say Final Fantasy Tactics Advance because I don't actually own the game, or the Game Boy Advance, so I have to borrow both.

02:31:33.740 --> 02:31:39.740
You mooch-er, you mooch-er, you have my DDR Max, and you have someone else's tactics in Game Boy. Mooch!

02:31:39.740 --> 02:31:46.740
And you have Jamie's Parappa. Mooch! It's Moochie the Mooch-er here on OnSoft Radio.

02:31:46.740 --> 02:31:49.740
Mooch. Mooch.

02:31:49.740 --> 02:31:50.740
Okay.

02:31:50.740 --> 02:31:52.740
He's in Davis, that's where you're supposed to mooch from.

02:31:52.740 --> 02:31:59.040
I'd also like to say F U to Initial D, because the music and the animation style sucks, and

02:31:59.040 --> 02:32:05.040
the story is straight out of a bad samurai movie. And F U to my DVD drive for dying.

02:32:05.040 --> 02:32:13.400
All right, that's it. That's all the FUs of the week. Thank you for playing.

02:32:13.400 --> 02:32:21.800
Okay, so I think we'll take another break. We exhausted all our new MP, oh, we exhausted

02:32:21.800 --> 02:32:29.600
all our new Max MP3s, so why don't we go back and visit Max USA 1? We'll go back and visit

02:32:29.600 --> 02:32:31.800
that. We're going to play some songs from Max 1 USA.

02:32:31.800 --> 02:32:38.640
I'm going to get stabbed with a pitchfork. What am I getting stabbed with if I play Samstorm

02:32:38.640 --> 02:32:45.440
Chopsticks? Well, we're going to start this break off with Samstorm, and after that we'll

02:32:45.440 --> 02:32:47.200
hear some other things from Max USA.

02:32:47.200 --> 02:32:49.400
I have a comment.

02:32:49.400 --> 02:32:50.400
Thoughtters die.

02:32:50.400 --> 02:32:51.400
Thank you.

02:32:51.400 --> 02:32:52.400
Thank you for sharing.

02:32:52.400 --> 02:32:54.400
Sign up for my message board.

02:32:54.400 --> 02:32:55.400
All right.

02:32:55.400 --> 02:32:59.520
We'll be back after this break and what do you guys think?

02:32:59.520 --> 02:33:02.400
How about Ask Orange Lounge when we come out?

02:33:02.400 --> 02:33:03.400
Sure.

02:33:03.400 --> 02:33:04.400
All right.

02:33:04.400 --> 02:33:09.360
The chat room has some questions so send your questions now for Ask Orange Lounge and for

02:33:09.360 --> 02:33:13.240
the 5,000th time we'll play Overloaded after the show.

02:33:13.240 --> 02:33:14.840
We've already played it tonight during the show.

02:33:14.840 --> 02:33:18.080
Yeah, I'm going to overload you in a minute.

02:33:18.080 --> 02:33:19.080
All right.

02:33:19.080 --> 02:33:26.080
We'll be back.

02:34:49.080 --> 02:34:59.080
Yeah, drop the bar, just drop the bar, yeah, drop the bar

02:34:59.080 --> 02:35:01.080
Let's get to the top

02:35:01.080 --> 02:35:03.080
Yeah, if you get down to the top of the line, it's just a dollar

02:35:03.080 --> 02:35:05.080
There is a top of the line, you're flashing long ways

02:35:05.080 --> 02:35:07.080
You're a different person, but I can't hide the institution today

02:35:07.080 --> 02:35:09.080
Don't get me wrong, I'm a pastor

02:35:09.080 --> 02:35:11.080
The mind map is more than this

02:35:11.080 --> 02:35:13.080
Well, concern on what it takes to deserve it's all we need

02:35:13.080 --> 02:35:15.080
Hey, boy, you gotta lose your momentum

02:35:15.080 --> 02:35:17.080
If you need to write those events

02:35:17.080 --> 02:35:19.080
Ride the waves, time's counting, the rhythm's a market

02:35:19.080 --> 02:35:21.080
If we can't get wind of the maintenance center

02:35:21.080 --> 02:35:23.080
It all might be hard for you to do it now, you got to hang those solids

02:35:23.080 --> 02:35:25.080
Yeah, so ready to take that ball

02:35:25.080 --> 02:35:27.080
You can make it all the way from the ball

02:35:29.080 --> 02:35:31.080
Yeah, yeah, drop the ball

02:35:33.080 --> 02:35:35.080
Drop the ball

02:35:35.080 --> 02:35:37.080
Let's just keep that ball

02:35:41.080 --> 02:35:43.080
If we can't just build more rhythm

02:35:43.080 --> 02:35:45.080
If we need the right tools and sensors

02:35:45.080 --> 02:35:47.080
I'm counting the rhythm, the march to the system

02:35:47.080 --> 02:35:49.080
Don't get with it, I'm saying you're staring all by the heart

02:35:49.080 --> 02:35:51.080
You can do it now, you're looking back, don't fall

02:35:51.080 --> 02:35:54.080
Yeah, it's a race to take that fall, and it's up to you to hit that goal

02:35:57.080 --> 02:35:58.080
You can drop that ball

02:36:00.080 --> 02:36:01.080
You can drop that ball

02:36:03.080 --> 02:36:04.080
You can drop that ball

02:36:34.080 --> 02:36:37.580
Leave me alone, don't tell me why

02:36:37.580 --> 02:36:41.080
There is nothing to carry on

02:36:41.080 --> 02:36:46.580
Leave me alone, it's not right

02:36:46.580 --> 02:36:48.080
And why

02:36:48.080 --> 02:36:51.580
Leave me alone, so many days

02:36:51.580 --> 02:36:55.080
Just thinking of you so many nights

02:36:55.080 --> 02:37:00.080
Leave me alone, it's not right

02:37:00.080 --> 02:37:02.080
Now tell me why

02:37:07.080 --> 02:37:09.080
Now tell me why

02:37:39.080 --> 02:38:05.200
Alright, welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 62 in progress.

02:38:05.200 --> 02:38:07.680
As promised, we're going to do Ask Orange Lounge,

02:38:07.680 --> 02:38:11.240
so send your questions to us now in the chat room.

02:38:11.240 --> 02:38:14.040
Anybody have any quick thoughts, any other Bimani-related things

02:38:14.040 --> 02:38:16.520
they want to talk about before we get into Ask Orange Lounge?

02:38:16.520 --> 02:38:17.020
What now?

02:38:17.020 --> 02:38:17.520
No, no, no.

02:38:17.520 --> 02:38:18.680
What?

02:38:18.680 --> 02:38:20.080
Any interesting Bimani stories?

02:38:20.080 --> 02:38:21.680
I have a question to ask the chat room.

02:38:21.680 --> 02:38:22.400
What's that?

02:38:22.400 --> 02:38:23.520
Is it safe?

02:38:23.520 --> 02:38:25.320
Is it safe?

02:38:25.320 --> 02:38:27.000
Oh, you have to send your message or you

02:38:27.000 --> 02:38:28.640
have to send your questions over private message

02:38:28.640 --> 02:38:29.760
or they aren't counted.

02:38:29.760 --> 02:38:32.520
Also, real fast, just to plug some of our other programming

02:38:32.520 --> 02:38:34.840
on Orange Lounge Radio, bringing you live programming

02:38:34.840 --> 02:38:36.080
more throughout the week.

02:38:36.080 --> 02:38:41.160
Tomorrow night is Vanilla Sky, featuring myself and my cohorts

02:38:41.160 --> 02:38:43.840
in Crime, Rice Princess, and Lanky Style.

02:38:43.840 --> 02:38:46.720
And we just sit around, and we talk about other video games.

02:38:46.720 --> 02:38:49.840
And we kind of talk about other weird stuff, too.

02:38:49.840 --> 02:38:51.400
We'll talk about what's in the news,

02:38:51.400 --> 02:38:53.880
and how it relates to our world, and things that piss us off.

02:38:53.880 --> 02:38:55.040
Oh my god, you read the news.

02:38:55.040 --> 02:38:57.120
And Yahoo, yes, we read the news to our listeners,

02:38:57.120 --> 02:38:59.480
because they aren't going to get it any other way.

02:38:59.480 --> 02:39:02.120
We make fun of Yahoo, and we do video game

02:39:02.120 --> 02:39:05.560
trivia to bad music, and all sorts of fun things like that.

02:39:05.560 --> 02:39:08.320
So tune in at 7 o'clock Monday night, Pacific time.

02:39:08.320 --> 02:39:16.440
On Tuesday nights, excuse me, that was a peanut burp.

02:39:16.440 --> 02:39:21.960
Anyway, Tuesday night is pump up the volume where I play your

02:39:21.960 --> 02:39:23.760
requests from our chat room.

02:39:23.760 --> 02:39:26.840
Except the thing is, nobody requests anything, god damn it.

02:39:26.840 --> 02:39:28.560
That's OK, more songs you get to play for yourself.

02:39:28.560 --> 02:39:33.800
So you could do, I'll basically partake in my really weird taste in music.

02:39:33.940 --> 02:39:38.780
I could do a show called Ice Cream for five minutes.

02:39:40.000 --> 02:39:44.260
This weekend on Orange Lounge Radio on Thursday,

02:39:44.260 --> 02:39:51.600
I will do a show called Ice Cream, it's a reference to the webcam.

02:39:51.600 --> 02:39:59.980
Anyways, I should do a show called Ice Cream for Five Minutes, in which I will scream for

02:39:59.980 --> 02:40:00.980
five minutes.

02:40:00.980 --> 02:40:01.980
Ice cream?

02:40:01.980 --> 02:40:02.980
You're going to give out ice cream for five minutes?

02:40:02.980 --> 02:40:03.980
Oh my God, I can't hear you.

02:40:03.980 --> 02:40:04.980
No, here, okay.

02:40:04.980 --> 02:40:05.980
Here, hold on.

02:40:05.980 --> 02:40:09.500
Before you do this, this is actually Orsage Radio related.

02:40:09.500 --> 02:40:14.140
I'm thinking, I may do, okay, we're going to, one of two things is going to happen.

02:40:14.140 --> 02:40:18.300
Either Live Water is going to come back, or a new show.

02:40:18.300 --> 02:40:19.300
What's that?

02:40:19.300 --> 02:40:20.300
Involving basketball.

02:40:20.300 --> 02:40:21.300
No, no!

02:40:21.300 --> 02:40:28.060
Seriously, a new show, seriously, what are you talking about, I can't get the mic any

02:40:28.060 --> 02:40:34.100
closer, what are you talking about, they're away, oh okay, anyways, so the new show, it's

02:40:34.100 --> 02:40:42.620
gonna be a game show, oh a game show, my favorite, a new, uh yeah, as long as there's nothing

02:40:42.620 --> 02:40:52.140
the box okay you can have the box anyways new game show possibly if I

02:40:52.140 --> 02:40:57.420
decide I don't want to live wire anymore it will be there will actually be

02:40:57.420 --> 02:41:02.060
prizes serious like no prizes given away so and what kind of game show will this

02:41:02.060 --> 02:41:06.460
be do we know yet I don't know okay something crazy very crazy I was gonna

02:41:06.460 --> 02:41:14.660
to call it like attention porn. Why are the girls yelling for porn? Like it was either

02:41:14.660 --> 02:41:20.740
going to be called like something like porn. Shut up! Like the ten second attention span

02:41:20.740 --> 02:41:32.140
show or something like that. Alright. I'll be fine. Okay fine. Porn. Back to my show

02:41:32.140 --> 02:41:39.520
show, which I instilled. It starts at 7 o'clock, because the pre-show at 730, the show begins

02:41:39.520 --> 02:41:44.400
to 1030. And basically, I just play a bunch of crap. And I've been saying that I'm going

02:41:44.400 --> 02:41:53.240
to do video game music trivia, but I don't know. People send me songs. I'll have my IRC

02:41:53.240 --> 02:42:01.080
open. My name is DarkSakuraSSF. So start sending me video game music if you want to play. If

02:42:01.080 --> 02:42:06.140
not been near a big stinky poopy head. Fair enough. And that's the bottom line because

02:42:06.140 --> 02:42:16.320
Dark Sakura said so. Okay. Go online! Wednesday nights are open. I was following the example

02:42:16.320 --> 02:42:22.140
of our, you know, Beymani influence system SF. Wednesday nights are open right now. We

02:42:22.140 --> 02:42:27.780
do a bit of randomness on Wednesdays. This week I've been asked to do Orange Lounge Presents

02:42:27.780 --> 02:42:33.540
Trivial Pursuit on Wednesday, which we might do. I don't know yet. I know there's enough

02:42:33.540 --> 02:42:38.780
interest from the regulars on all the shows to do it. Okay.

02:42:38.780 --> 02:42:41.280
If I was playing that, we'd have to break out the Janus edition.

02:42:41.280 --> 02:42:46.080
So I'm thinking we're going to do Trivial Pursuit on Wednesday, but stay tuned to our

02:42:46.080 --> 02:42:49.700
chat room for details. So drop in our chat room sometime during the week and we'll have

02:42:49.700 --> 02:42:51.020
a Trivial Pursuit this Wednesday.

02:42:51.020 --> 02:42:52.820
If you're not in the chat room, you're not cool.

02:42:52.820 --> 02:42:57.300
Yeah, if you're not in our chat room 24 hours a day, you're not cool.

02:42:57.300 --> 02:42:59.300
I visit like maybe once a week.

02:42:59.300 --> 02:43:05.300
Well, if you're not there 24 hours a day you're not cool, but if you're there 24 hour days

02:43:05.300 --> 02:43:07.740
you don't have a life.

02:43:07.740 --> 02:43:08.740
And then you're not cool.

02:43:08.740 --> 02:43:09.740
You're screwed.

02:43:09.740 --> 02:43:10.740
You're screwed.

02:43:10.740 --> 02:43:11.740
What a fun thought.

02:43:11.740 --> 02:43:12.740
Either way, you're a loser.

02:43:12.740 --> 02:43:13.740
All right.

02:43:13.740 --> 02:43:20.260
Thursday night Snowboard Lounge Radio is hiatus right now.

02:43:20.260 --> 02:43:22.940
We might be doing some repeats of Live Wire.

02:43:22.940 --> 02:43:25.500
If I get brave, I might do a new mix, so we'll see.

02:43:25.500 --> 02:43:28.500
There might be another potential...

02:43:28.500 --> 02:43:31.840
I did one Megamix, it played after Vanilla Sky one week.

02:43:31.840 --> 02:43:33.980
There might be another potential goodie, though.

02:43:33.980 --> 02:43:35.820
Hmm, a goodie.

02:43:35.820 --> 02:43:39.660
Ah, yes, we have another show that may be coming up on soon, so...

02:43:39.660 --> 02:43:40.660
Maybe not this Thursday, but soon.

02:43:40.660 --> 02:43:46.100
Which, you know, I think that we need to introduce one of our newer listeners as another foreign

02:43:46.100 --> 02:43:47.780
correspondent.

02:43:47.780 --> 02:43:49.940
Even though he probably can't make it up here.

02:43:49.940 --> 02:43:50.940
Don't!

02:43:50.940 --> 02:43:51.940
He's probably not listening.

02:43:51.940 --> 02:43:52.940
Is he listening?

02:43:52.940 --> 02:43:53.940
I don't think he's listening, he's not in the chat room.

02:43:53.940 --> 02:43:54.940
Well, poop.

02:43:54.940 --> 02:43:57.940
Make sure he's here next week and we'll give him a proper introduction.

02:43:57.940 --> 02:43:59.940
We'll give him a proper introduction next week if he shows up.

02:43:59.940 --> 02:44:01.940
In the meantime, we've only got 20 minutes left of show,

02:44:01.940 --> 02:44:03.940
or actually no, 25 because we started late tonight,

02:44:03.940 --> 02:44:06.940
but we have plenty of questions that have already been submitted.

02:44:06.940 --> 02:44:07.940
It's not too late.

02:44:07.940 --> 02:44:12.940
If you want to join in, go into www.calibomani.com,

02:44:12.940 --> 02:44:17.940
click on Orange Lounge, and click on Chat,

02:44:17.940 --> 02:44:21.940
and you can submit a question for Ask Orange Lounge.

02:44:21.940 --> 02:44:28.040
We have to listen to Rob sing.

02:44:28.040 --> 02:44:30.940
Let's ask Orange Lounge some stupid questions.

02:44:30.940 --> 02:44:34.400
Rob's going to sing all week this week on Orange Lounge's video.

02:44:34.400 --> 02:44:35.400
Oh my God, they need to fight.

02:44:35.400 --> 02:44:38.120
Jamie needs to stop playing with a fucking ferret.

02:44:38.120 --> 02:44:39.120
I'm not playing with a ferret.

02:44:39.120 --> 02:44:43.360
Or I'm going to get lucky to shove up her ass.

02:44:43.360 --> 02:44:44.360
Rob?

02:44:44.360 --> 02:44:45.360
Rob?

02:44:45.360 --> 02:44:46.360
Rob?

02:44:46.360 --> 02:44:47.360
What?

02:44:47.360 --> 02:44:48.360
Rob?

02:44:48.360 --> 02:44:49.360
What?

02:44:49.360 --> 02:44:50.360
Rob?

02:44:50.360 --> 02:44:51.360
What?

02:44:51.360 --> 02:44:52.360
What?

02:44:52.360 --> 02:44:53.360
What?

02:44:53.360 --> 02:44:54.360
Rob?

02:44:54.360 --> 02:44:55.360
What?

02:44:55.360 --> 02:44:56.360
Nothing.

02:44:56.360 --> 02:44:57.360
Alright.

02:44:57.360 --> 02:44:58.360
Rob!

02:44:58.360 --> 02:44:59.360
Biohazard has about seven questions.

02:44:59.360 --> 02:45:00.360
Rob!

02:45:00.360 --> 02:45:01.360
Rob!

02:45:01.360 --> 02:45:02.360
Rob!

02:45:02.360 --> 02:45:03.360
Shut up!

02:45:03.360 --> 02:45:04.360
Rob!

02:45:04.360 --> 02:45:05.360
Biohazard has about seven questions to ask tonight.

02:45:05.360 --> 02:45:06.360
Rob!

02:45:06.360 --> 02:45:07.360
Shut the fuck up!

02:45:07.360 --> 02:45:08.360
Rob!

02:45:08.360 --> 02:45:09.360
Alright.

02:45:09.360 --> 02:45:11.360
Has about seven questions to ask.

02:45:11.360 --> 02:45:12.360
Rob!

02:45:12.360 --> 02:45:13.360
What?

02:45:13.360 --> 02:45:14.360
Hi.

02:45:14.360 --> 02:45:18.440
He's turning red in the face.

02:45:18.440 --> 02:45:20.920
I'm starting off with questions from Biohazard.

02:45:20.920 --> 02:45:30.920
Why doesn't Jimmy crack carrots or potatoes or something? Corn is so boring.

02:45:30.920 --> 02:45:33.920
Why doesn't Jimmy just do crack?

02:45:33.920 --> 02:45:36.920
Good, I like that.

02:45:36.920 --> 02:45:43.920
Biohazard also wants to know how long will I have to wait for Overloaded to be available on Bimani style or acquire it some other way?

02:45:43.920 --> 02:45:45.920
Excuse me, are we Bimani style?

02:45:45.920 --> 02:45:46.920
Yeah, are we Bimani style?

02:45:46.920 --> 02:45:53.920
I already have it, but I just played it on the show.

02:45:53.920 --> 02:45:59.320
We're not the Mani style, go ask them.

02:45:59.320 --> 02:46:03.000
If you were a member of our Orange Lounge Radio Live Journal community, you would have

02:46:03.000 --> 02:46:05.040
already gotten a link to that file.

02:46:05.040 --> 02:46:08.200
Oh, that's right, Loki posted it earlier this week, didn't he?

02:46:08.200 --> 02:46:09.200
So you saw it.

02:46:09.200 --> 02:46:10.200
Alright.

02:46:10.200 --> 02:46:11.200
Alright.

02:46:11.200 --> 02:46:12.200
Who cares about the step file?

02:46:12.200 --> 02:46:13.200
Orange Lounge.

02:46:13.200 --> 02:46:14.200
Make your own damn step file.

02:46:14.200 --> 02:46:15.200
Community.

02:46:15.200 --> 02:46:16.200
Oh yeah, and why?

02:46:16.200 --> 02:46:19.040
And why he cracks corn is so you don't care.

02:46:19.040 --> 02:46:20.880
Because it's so boring, you don't care.

02:46:20.880 --> 02:46:21.880
Oh, go back to that.

02:46:21.880 --> 02:46:24.880
Sorry, we missed you on the first one, Riley.

02:46:24.880 --> 02:46:29.280
People got a lot of free time if they're coming up with questions like, why does Jimmy crack

02:46:29.280 --> 02:46:30.920
corn and not potatoes?

02:46:30.920 --> 02:46:33.080
You can't crack potatoes anyway.

02:46:33.080 --> 02:46:35.720
I'll read one more from Biohazard, then I'm going to somebody else, and we'll come back

02:46:35.720 --> 02:46:37.040
to the rest of those questions.

02:46:37.040 --> 02:46:42.080
Biohazard wants to know, how would I write a script for SysReset to display a random

02:46:42.080 --> 02:46:49.920
line from a txt file every time exclamation bad joke is pulled do what is that like like

Aaron really wants to answer this, so I'll do one more. Why get mad when you can get

02:47:15.200 --> 02:47:21.120
glad? Well, you know, I don't really know, but what I say is why get mad when you can

02:47:52.280 --> 02:47:58.680
not violent horny gangbang violent horny gangbang I like that variation how

02:47:58.680 --> 02:48:02.900
How about velvet, horny gangbang?

02:48:02.900 --> 02:48:03.900
Violence is more fun.

02:48:03.900 --> 02:48:04.900
All right.

02:48:04.900 --> 02:48:07.100
Twenty-third maggots would like to know, how's the food-

02:48:07.100 --> 02:48:09.100
Ah, who cares?

02:48:09.100 --> 02:48:11.100
Be nice.

02:48:11.100 --> 02:48:12.740
How's the food over there?

02:48:12.740 --> 02:48:14.620
Because we all ate tonight.

02:48:14.620 --> 02:48:16.060
Well, no one's dead yet.

02:48:16.060 --> 02:48:17.060
And the food's gone.

02:48:17.060 --> 02:48:18.060
The food was good.

02:48:18.060 --> 02:48:19.060
Thank you.

02:48:19.060 --> 02:48:20.060
Sorry, hairball.

02:48:20.060 --> 02:48:27.860
Well, the food's gone, so it was eaten.

02:48:27.860 --> 02:48:33.740
best. It was at least tolerable if it's all gone.

02:48:33.740 --> 02:48:35.100
And Jamie makes a sad face.

02:48:35.100 --> 02:48:39.020
The eel was interesting. I've never really had eel in that mass quantity before. It was

02:48:39.020 --> 02:48:42.020
interesting. I don't know if I necessarily like the flavor, but it was good.

02:48:42.020 --> 02:48:45.380
I didn't even notice really that it was eel, because I ate it with chicken, too.

02:48:45.380 --> 02:48:50.060
Yeah, see, I had just straight-up eel. It was a little weird for me, but it was good.

02:48:50.060 --> 02:48:51.060
Oh.

02:48:51.060 --> 02:48:56.500
Oh, well, maybe that's why. It was good, though, and I appreciate Jamie's effort to cook for

02:48:56.500 --> 02:49:03.140
us because you know we're single and don't cook at least i don't anyway damn it i'm gonna

02:49:03.140 --> 02:49:09.700
make sure you guys have proper nutrition okay you're eating instant rice and like super

02:49:09.700 --> 02:49:17.580
bacon you are going to i haven't had super bacon in two weeks actually i've seen what's

02:49:17.580 --> 02:49:21.700
in your fridge and there's hardly anything in there when you guys live off of pop tarts

02:49:21.700 --> 02:49:30.860
Okay, Rob. For one week I challenge you. You need to eat the same things that I do for

02:49:30.860 --> 02:49:31.860
a week.

02:49:31.860 --> 02:49:32.860
Oh, give me a break.

02:49:32.860 --> 02:49:38.100
What I eat is very, very easy. Very easy. You have to have a bowl of oatmeal in the

02:49:38.100 --> 02:49:39.100
morning.

02:49:39.100 --> 02:49:40.100
Ew.

02:49:40.100 --> 02:49:41.100
Okay.

02:49:41.100 --> 02:49:42.100
Let me lick mud.

02:49:42.100 --> 02:49:43.100
Okay.

02:49:43.100 --> 02:49:47.620
Look, he said, let me lick mud.

02:49:47.620 --> 02:49:55.900
The brown sugar and maple instant oatmeal is really good, and Yoplait yogurt is really

02:49:55.900 --> 02:49:56.900
good.

02:49:56.900 --> 02:49:57.900
Oatmeal is for old people.

02:49:57.900 --> 02:50:00.420
Oatmeal is for people who like to shit.

02:50:00.420 --> 02:50:01.420
Wait.

02:50:01.420 --> 02:50:02.420
Wait.

02:50:02.420 --> 02:50:03.420
You like to shit?

02:50:03.420 --> 02:50:04.420
No.

02:50:04.420 --> 02:50:05.420
It's TMI radio.

02:50:05.420 --> 02:50:06.420
No.

02:50:06.420 --> 02:50:10.900
That's why old people eat it, but it's good for like your...

02:50:10.900 --> 02:50:12.900
It's fiber.

02:50:12.900 --> 02:50:16.540
Fiber is good for you.

02:50:16.540 --> 02:50:23.780
And then for lunch, you need to have a microwave dinner, because they're really good.

02:50:23.780 --> 02:50:26.140
And veggie burgers for dinner every night.

02:50:26.140 --> 02:50:27.140
Yeah.

02:50:27.140 --> 02:50:28.140
They're good.

02:50:28.140 --> 02:50:29.140
A veggie cheeseburger.

02:50:29.140 --> 02:50:32.140
I usually have veggie burgers for lunch.

02:50:32.140 --> 02:50:33.660
Okay, that's good.

02:50:33.660 --> 02:50:35.860
But see, one week.

02:50:35.860 --> 02:50:36.860
One week.

02:50:36.860 --> 02:50:37.860
No Pop-Tarts.

02:50:37.860 --> 02:50:40.740
Actually, I don't eat Pop-Tarts, actually.

02:50:40.740 --> 02:50:41.740
I don't like Pop-Tarts.

02:50:41.740 --> 02:50:45.300
I usually have either a Nutri-Grain bar in the morning, or I won't eat breakfast when

02:50:45.300 --> 02:50:47.580
I get to work on a bag of pretzels.

02:50:47.580 --> 02:50:49.420
That's not good for you.

02:50:49.420 --> 02:50:51.020
I try nutrient bars, though.

02:50:51.020 --> 02:50:53.020
That's usually what I eat.

02:50:53.020 --> 02:50:54.380
Eat people, OK?

02:50:54.380 --> 02:50:55.620
Eat people.

02:50:55.620 --> 02:50:59.060
And next week, I am bringing stir fry.

02:50:59.060 --> 02:51:01.340
Or we will cook stir fry.

02:51:01.340 --> 02:51:03.860
I have my super hot chocolate when I get to work.

02:51:03.860 --> 02:51:06.740
It's three bags of hot chocolate concentrated.

02:51:06.740 --> 02:51:08.860
And then I put a little bit of hot water in there,

02:51:08.860 --> 02:51:11.460
so it's super frothy.

02:51:11.460 --> 02:51:12.340
That's all I eat.

02:51:12.340 --> 02:51:14.340
Everything is super with you.

02:51:14.340 --> 02:51:21.020
The thing I used to have when I worked at this stupid temp agency that no longer exists

02:51:21.020 --> 02:51:27.180
in my universe, I would have half a cup of super strong coffee and then pour the rest

02:51:27.180 --> 02:51:32.100
of it in hot chocolate and then throw in like five packs of sugar and that was what I would

02:51:32.100 --> 02:51:33.100
drink every morning.

02:51:33.100 --> 02:51:34.100
That's healthy.

02:51:34.100 --> 02:51:35.500
See, I don't drink that crap anymore.

02:51:35.500 --> 02:51:42.260
I've been off of my soda now for a week, so I'm happy.

02:51:42.260 --> 02:51:48.260
23rd Magus would like to also know, Sky, that's me, could you give me my jokes back please?

02:51:48.260 --> 02:51:49.260
No.

02:51:49.260 --> 02:51:50.260
What, all three of them?

02:51:50.260 --> 02:51:52.260
Yeah, you wish you could be as cool as me.

02:51:52.260 --> 02:51:54.260
You want to drop from five last week?

02:51:54.260 --> 02:51:56.260
Yeah, he has negative jokes now.

02:51:56.260 --> 02:51:58.260
Campbell Soup, one of our new chatters.

02:51:58.260 --> 02:52:01.260
Unless it's somebody who changed our name, I don't think so.

02:52:01.260 --> 02:52:05.260
Campbell Soup would like to know, what's up with the foam on beer?

02:52:05.260 --> 02:52:06.260
Good question.

02:52:06.260 --> 02:52:08.260
It's what makes you fart.

02:52:08.260 --> 02:52:09.260
Hey, give me that.

02:52:09.260 --> 02:52:17.460
Why is beer better than women?

02:52:17.460 --> 02:52:18.460
Why?

02:52:18.460 --> 02:52:27.940
Because no matter how you pour it, you always have good head.

02:52:27.940 --> 02:52:32.900
I could have magism.

02:52:32.900 --> 02:52:36.180
He doesn't tell R-rated jokes though.

02:52:36.180 --> 02:52:37.660
Why is there foam on beer?

02:52:37.660 --> 02:52:43.360
It's just the way God made it, but all I have to say is don't drink beer, drink Guinness.

02:52:43.360 --> 02:52:46.260
Beer tastes like pee smells.

02:52:46.260 --> 02:52:50.100
Foam is there to remind you that you're wasting your time and if you want to get fucked up,

02:52:50.100 --> 02:52:51.140
just drink some hard liquor.

02:52:51.140 --> 02:52:56.340
Go straight for the 151 or the Schlager or Everclear.

02:52:56.340 --> 02:52:58.980
Alcohol recipe of the week, apple pie.

02:52:58.980 --> 02:53:02.580
The foam is there to remind you that you're a pussy, you're drinking beer.

02:53:02.580 --> 02:53:08.700
You get a big glass gallon jug of apple juice and then you pour it all out in another container

02:53:08.700 --> 02:53:13.680
and then you pour in about half a bottle of Everclear and let cinnamon sticks dissolve

02:53:13.680 --> 02:53:18.520
in it and then you pour in the apple juice and let it sit for like a couple days and

02:53:18.520 --> 02:53:21.380
you have apple pie.

02:53:21.380 --> 02:53:25.680
23rd Magus says beer goes down easy and I'd like to know is that the beer or the beer

02:53:25.680 --> 02:53:28.680
bottle in your case?

02:53:28.680 --> 02:53:35.680
Here is Nasty.

02:53:35.680 --> 02:53:49.240
How did the ferret get into the show?

02:53:49.240 --> 02:53:51.280
Ferret's been here since day one.

02:53:51.280 --> 02:53:57.960
Yeah, we've been throwing it around and having the ferrets rape each other and mad ferret

02:53:57.960 --> 02:53:58.960
sex.

02:53:58.960 --> 02:54:04.880
Actually, ferret number one was a birthday gift to me from my old stalker.

02:54:04.880 --> 02:54:08.700
And I just, I have all these stuffed animals, can you shut the goddamn thing up for one

02:54:08.700 --> 02:54:09.700
minute while I tell the story?

02:54:09.700 --> 02:54:11.800
It's the ferret story, he's always contributing.

02:54:11.800 --> 02:54:16.400
We used to have, or I still do, I have all my stuffed animals on top of the computer,

02:54:16.400 --> 02:54:19.760
like I know you can't really see it on the webcam, but there's all these stuffed animals

02:54:19.760 --> 02:54:23.080
that sit on top of the computer like Cartman, oh Bradley is turning the thing over so you

02:54:23.080 --> 02:54:24.080
can see the stuffed animals.

02:54:24.080 --> 02:54:28.680
We have like Cartman and Pikachu and like a little stuffed devil, my happy birthday

02:54:28.680 --> 02:54:30.880
bear that Jamie got me and all this stuff here.

02:54:30.880 --> 02:54:35.180
Oh it just went up to the camp so there you go you guys can look.

02:54:35.180 --> 02:54:38.700
And the ferret used to sit there and one day Jamie pulled it down and started pushing the

02:54:38.700 --> 02:54:44.440
button and learned that it made noises and behold the show got worse.

02:54:44.440 --> 02:54:48.160
And then Loki found the second ferret at some random store and he brought it over to some

02:54:48.160 --> 02:54:49.160
show a while back.

02:54:49.160 --> 02:54:54.160
They sell them at Walgreens so everyone can have a ferret of their own.

02:54:54.160 --> 02:54:55.160
H.K.

02:54:55.160 --> 02:55:06.920
Holley would like to know, can vegetarians eat animal crackers?

02:55:06.920 --> 02:55:10.560
If the lingos are not made out of animal parts.

02:55:10.560 --> 02:55:15.000
That's an interesting question.

02:55:15.000 --> 02:55:16.560
I would say yes, it's okay.

02:55:16.560 --> 02:55:20.900
I think I know some vegetarians who do eat animal crackers, especially, you know what's

02:55:20.900 --> 02:55:24.560
good with those animal crackers with the frosting on them and the little balls, the mother's

02:55:24.560 --> 02:55:25.560
crackers?

02:55:25.560 --> 02:55:26.560
You know what I'm talking about?

02:55:26.560 --> 02:55:27.560
Oh, yes, the mother's cookies.

02:55:27.560 --> 02:55:28.560
Mother's animal cookies.

02:55:28.560 --> 02:55:29.560
Those are the best.

02:55:29.560 --> 02:55:30.560
Good shit.

02:55:30.560 --> 02:55:31.560
Yes, they are.

02:55:31.560 --> 02:55:32.560
I wouldn't care if I was vegan.

02:55:32.560 --> 02:55:33.560
I'd still eat them.

02:55:33.560 --> 02:55:34.560
They're so fat.

02:55:34.560 --> 02:55:39.540
I'm just reminded of an old question.

02:55:39.540 --> 02:55:42.000
Do vegans swallow?

02:55:42.000 --> 02:55:45.520
Yes, and I know.

02:55:45.520 --> 02:55:49.520
Okay, too much ice today to vegan.

02:55:49.520 --> 02:55:53.520
Whale.

02:55:53.520 --> 02:55:57.520
Oh, Tao says as a vegetarian he would just like to say yes he can eat

02:55:57.520 --> 02:56:01.520
animal cookies. So there you go, there's your question. You learn something new on Orange Lounge Radio every day.

02:56:01.520 --> 02:56:05.520
We're still accepting questions for Ask Orange Lounge by the way, just send them over a private

02:56:05.520 --> 02:56:09.520
message to Sky in the chat room. No, we still have a few left. Biohazard

02:56:09.520 --> 02:56:13.520
sent me plenty to get us through a whole other show.

02:56:13.520 --> 02:56:18.000
www.calibomani.com, click on Orange Lounge, and click on chat.

02:56:18.000 --> 02:56:19.240
NoStylin, oh god.

02:56:19.240 --> 02:56:20.200
Oh, god.

02:56:20.200 --> 02:56:20.960
Here it is.

02:56:20.960 --> 02:56:22.880
No, here it is.

02:56:22.880 --> 02:56:25.360
It's actually a good question.

02:56:25.360 --> 02:56:26.400
Here it is.

02:56:26.400 --> 02:56:29.360
How come you guys don't play more Eurobeat?

02:56:33.760 --> 02:56:36.720
I guess my theory would be because to a lot of people

02:56:36.720 --> 02:56:39.080
who don't know Eurobeat, it all sounds exactly the same.

02:56:39.080 --> 02:56:46.080
No Stylin also says there should be a Bimani Eurobeat hour.

02:56:46.080 --> 02:56:47.080
No!

02:56:47.080 --> 02:56:49.080
God, no!

02:56:49.080 --> 02:56:51.080
What the hell is wrong with you?

02:56:51.080 --> 02:56:54.080
What was the question?

02:56:54.080 --> 02:56:56.080
Why doesn't Orange Lounge Radio play more Eurobeat?

02:56:56.080 --> 02:56:58.080
We can play more Eurobeat.

02:56:58.080 --> 02:57:00.080
Jamie's done Eurobeat pre-shows.

02:57:00.080 --> 02:57:04.080
I've done, like, hours of Eurobeat on my show, too.

02:57:04.080 --> 02:57:05.080
You know what?

02:57:05.080 --> 02:57:06.080
Tune in to Jamie's show, because she's the biggest Eurobeat fan.

02:57:06.080 --> 02:57:11.440
I was at a two-hour marathon of Eurobeat a couple weeks ago.

02:57:11.440 --> 02:57:12.440
So you know what?

02:57:12.440 --> 02:57:15.320
If you don't think we play enough Eurobeat, you're listening to the wrong shows.

02:57:15.320 --> 02:57:20.160
Listen to Tuesday night's Pump of the Volume.

02:57:20.160 --> 02:57:22.280
I am not vegan, God no.

02:57:22.280 --> 02:57:25.120
Like I have that kind of discipline, one of my exes is.

02:57:25.120 --> 02:57:30.680
He made this really good eggplant stuff at a party at my house.

02:57:30.680 --> 02:57:32.320
And nobody ate it but you and I?

02:57:32.320 --> 02:57:34.320
Well, I ate lots of it.

02:57:34.320 --> 02:57:40.200
was good. John Fields would like to know, what do you call a river that's too big for

02:57:40.200 --> 02:57:49.760
its bridges? You need to shut up right now. That was the worst pun ever. That was a pun

02:57:49.760 --> 02:57:54.840
straight out of 23rd Magus's book. You owe Magus a quarter. Give him a quarter. Pay them

02:57:54.840 --> 02:57:59.960
royalties and we'll stick the RIAA on you. Take it now. We'll stick the RIAA on you if

02:57:59.960 --> 02:58:00.960
We don't.

02:58:00.960 --> 02:58:02.400
No styling has another question.

02:58:02.400 --> 02:58:03.400
God.

02:58:03.400 --> 02:58:08.360
What came first, the egg or the chicken?

02:58:08.360 --> 02:58:09.640
Depends on your religion.

02:58:09.640 --> 02:58:13.840
Well, in that sentence, the egg came first in your sentence, so.

02:58:13.840 --> 02:58:16.520
Yes, Loki.

02:58:16.520 --> 02:58:21.080
Get a mic.

02:58:21.080 --> 02:58:25.000
The chicken and egg rhetorical question is the dumbest thing ever because it's not actually

02:58:25.000 --> 02:58:26.000
a rhetorical question.

02:58:26.000 --> 02:58:29.120
They did not specify what type of an egg it was.

02:58:29.120 --> 02:58:32.160
Therefore, dinosaurs predated chickens.

02:58:32.160 --> 02:58:33.720
Therefore, the egg came first.

02:58:37.720 --> 02:58:39.200
People would have an answer.

02:58:39.200 --> 02:58:39.700
Wow.

02:58:39.700 --> 02:58:41.000
Philosophical moment.

02:58:41.000 --> 02:58:42.640
That was deep.

02:58:42.640 --> 02:58:45.920
That was deep like a puddle.

02:58:45.920 --> 02:58:48.760
All right.

02:58:48.760 --> 02:58:51.600
Going back to biohazards questions,

02:58:51.600 --> 02:58:53.440
because that's all the questions we have left,

02:58:53.440 --> 02:58:56.920
unless people send more over private messages to Skye.

02:58:56.920 --> 02:58:58.880
Do you think that it's safe?

02:58:58.880 --> 02:58:59.880
No.

02:58:59.880 --> 02:59:00.880
No.

02:59:00.880 --> 02:59:05.720
You're listening to the show, aren't you?

02:59:05.720 --> 02:59:08.440
The chat room's talking about their vegetarian stints.

02:59:08.440 --> 02:59:10.600
I have actually had a vegetarian stint.

02:59:10.600 --> 02:59:13.240
I was vegetarian for about a month.

02:59:13.240 --> 02:59:14.300
You know what?

02:59:14.300 --> 02:59:16.600
I want to bet doing it.

02:59:16.600 --> 02:59:24.680
This is, as of April, made two years that I've gone without beef or pork on a regular

02:59:24.680 --> 02:59:25.680
basis.

02:59:25.680 --> 02:59:30.100
I had a nibble now and then, but I've stayed off of it.

02:59:30.100 --> 02:59:32.820
I would like to say, I have not drank regular soda

02:59:32.820 --> 02:59:34.280
in about six months.

02:59:34.280 --> 02:59:35.900
But I need to cut back on diet, though,

02:59:35.900 --> 02:59:36.940
because I do drink diet.

02:59:36.940 --> 02:59:38.280
Diet says it's worse for you.

02:59:38.280 --> 02:59:42.620
I haven't smoked a cigarette in four years.

02:59:42.620 --> 02:59:45.100
You know, I haven't smoked a cigarette in five and a half

02:59:45.100 --> 02:59:45.700
years.

02:59:45.700 --> 02:59:49.340
I haven't smoked a cigarette in a week.

02:59:49.340 --> 02:59:50.980
You are so square.

02:59:50.980 --> 02:59:52.540
I know, aren't I?

02:59:52.540 --> 02:59:57.540
Biohazard would also like to know

02:59:57.540 --> 03:00:00.660
Why haven't I heard any ferrets yet? Did you burn them?

03:00:00.660 --> 03:00:05.340
Obviously we have not. Those ferrets won't go away.

03:00:05.340 --> 03:00:10.260
Thanks. Here's a somewhat serious question from Biohazard. Biohazard would like to know

03:00:10.260 --> 03:00:14.980
why can't we vote for Holik? Because we said so and we are the authority.

03:00:14.980 --> 03:00:19.380
Because I have the real answer to the question. Holik is already in rotation on

03:00:19.380 --> 03:00:22.180
the station therefore if you vote for it you're voting a song

03:00:22.180 --> 03:00:27.020
into rotation. It's already in rotation. You don't need to vote for Holik. You rhymed,

03:00:27.020 --> 03:00:32.580
Rob. I rhymed. I'm great. Rotation on the station. Rotation on the station. It's a fucking

03:00:32.580 --> 03:00:39.580
Rode beat song. Now you sound like you're spitting on the microphone. It's just that

03:00:41.700 --> 03:00:48.700
talented song. What is the meaning of life expressed through interpretive dance in front

03:00:48.700 --> 03:00:51.340
Press through interpretive dance in front of the webcam.

03:00:51.340 --> 03:00:52.340
42.

03:00:52.340 --> 03:01:00.300
Hold on, in about 10 seconds I'm going to show you the next webcam image I will be showing

03:01:00.300 --> 03:01:04.940
you the meaning of life and I will be getting help from the others showing you the meaning

03:01:04.940 --> 03:01:05.940
of life.

03:01:05.940 --> 03:01:06.940
There it goes.

03:01:06.940 --> 03:01:13.820
Four, two, one, there the meaning of life is up there on our cam for you to see right

03:01:13.820 --> 03:01:15.820
now.

03:01:15.820 --> 03:01:19.820
Alright.

03:01:19.820 --> 03:01:23.820
I got your meat of the life.

03:01:23.820 --> 03:01:27.820
His last question is, why do I ask so many questions?

03:01:27.820 --> 03:01:31.820
Because you suck. No way, he answered his own questions?

03:01:31.820 --> 03:01:35.820
This is the meaning of life.

03:01:35.820 --> 03:01:39.820
No.

03:01:39.820 --> 03:01:43.820
Wait, wait, wait, he answered his own question, nevermind.

03:01:43.820 --> 03:01:48.820
I think it skipped the picture.

03:01:48.820 --> 03:01:50.820
It's not there.

03:01:50.820 --> 03:01:51.820
Bummer.

03:01:51.820 --> 03:01:57.940
23rd Magus would like to know, will you people stop fucking stealing my jokes, puns or my

03:01:57.940 --> 03:01:58.940
department bitches?

03:01:58.940 --> 03:01:59.940
Hey, you know what?

03:01:59.940 --> 03:02:00.940
What's the meaning of life?

03:02:00.940 --> 03:02:03.420
Did you write the information for Max 2?

03:02:03.420 --> 03:02:04.420
I don't think so.

03:02:04.420 --> 03:02:05.660
Did you write the information screens for that?

03:02:05.660 --> 03:02:06.660
I don't think so.

03:02:06.660 --> 03:02:10.220
Therefore, you suck at puns.

03:02:10.220 --> 03:02:15.500
No Stylin would like to know, how many sounds does the ferret have? About seven.

03:02:15.500 --> 03:02:18.100
And we don't need to hear them all.

03:02:18.100 --> 03:02:19.740
Look at the webcam right now.

03:02:19.740 --> 03:02:21.700
John Fields would like to know,

03:02:21.700 --> 03:02:26.660
any interest in any of the games that are being shown at Tokyo Game Show?

03:02:26.660 --> 03:02:33.180
Well, DDR Party Edition, I guess.

03:02:33.180 --> 03:02:34.280
Otherwise,

03:02:34.280 --> 03:02:38.280
otherwise I don't really give a shit, I find. You know what? We'll see them when we

03:02:38.280 --> 03:02:39.100
see them.

03:02:39.100 --> 03:02:41.760
Who cares if they're coming out in Tokyo? We need them out here.

03:02:41.760 --> 03:02:45.500
Say this really great role-playing game comes out in Japan. Guess what? It's in Japanese.

03:02:45.500 --> 03:02:48.220
It doesn't matter. I can't read it.

03:02:48.220 --> 03:02:55.220
Hey, but if they put out another grandiose, I'll import it.

03:02:56.560 --> 03:02:59.380
No.

03:02:59.380 --> 03:03:03.820
A biohazard would also like to know, am I infamous for my bad questions yet?

03:03:03.820 --> 03:03:08.360
Actually, no. You just kind of act stupid to us.

03:03:08.360 --> 03:03:10.760
You sure are famous.

03:03:10.760 --> 03:03:13.560
23rd Magus would like to know, is it true that Jason Enos asked

03:03:13.560 --> 03:03:15.640
for my help in writing the info screens?

03:03:15.640 --> 03:03:19.000
No, you made that up.

03:03:19.000 --> 03:03:21.040
All right, let's close up the mailbag.

03:03:21.040 --> 03:03:22.920
Thank you, everybody, for playing Ask Orange Lounge.

03:03:22.920 --> 03:03:24.960
You know what we haven't looked at in a long time, Rob?

03:03:24.960 --> 03:03:25.480
Sorry.

03:03:25.480 --> 03:03:26.720
Our actual mail.

03:03:26.720 --> 03:03:29.760
Hold on.

03:03:29.760 --> 03:03:33.400
Now we're done with Ask Orange Lounge Radio.

03:03:33.400 --> 03:03:35.160
We hope you learned something tonight

03:03:35.160 --> 03:03:37.160
on Ask Orange Lounge Radio.

03:03:37.160 --> 03:03:44.160
Hey, guess what? Next week, the Ferrets will be here because I'm going to go outside and run them over with my car.

03:03:47.160 --> 03:03:48.160
Alright.

03:03:51.160 --> 03:03:52.160
Let's see if...

03:03:54.160 --> 03:03:57.160
Let's... I'm just hoping the batteries fucking die someday.

03:03:58.160 --> 03:04:00.160
As are half our listeners, I'm sure. Okay.

03:04:00.160 --> 03:04:05.440
Okay. The show would not be the same without the Ferret. The Ferret is our mascot.

03:04:05.440 --> 03:04:10.680
Yeah, we're actually checking our actual email address

03:04:10.680 --> 03:04:14.720
at orangeloungeloungeradio, all one word, at yahoo.com. We have two new messages, it

03:04:14.720 --> 03:04:15.320
looks like,

03:04:15.320 --> 03:04:19.240
and it's spam. Let's see.

03:04:19.240 --> 03:04:23.900
Yahoo Education. Advance your learning goals. Yahoo Education introduces courses

03:04:23.900 --> 03:04:24.680
and degrees.

03:04:24.680 --> 03:04:30.120
SBC Yahoo DSL. Hey, only $29.95 a month for fast

03:04:30.120 --> 03:04:35.280

03:04:48.640 --> 03:04:52.820
have in our mailbag if you'd like to fill up our mailbag orange lounge radio

03:04:52.820 --> 03:04:57.200
at yahoo.com all right we have some more ask orange last questions I'm taking

03:04:57.200 --> 03:05:00.640
these last three and that's it we're finishing this bit and we're ending the

03:05:00.640 --> 03:05:04.560
show. Here's some ferret ass for you. FileHazard wants to know what was the date of the

03:05:04.560 --> 03:05:10.080
first Orange Lounge radio show? The date of the first live show is July or sorry

03:05:10.080 --> 03:05:19.160
June 23rd 2002. The station first went on air I think May 18th of that

03:05:19.160 --> 03:05:26.720
year May 18th or 22nd somewhere in there. The first live show is June 23rd 2002.

03:05:26.720 --> 03:05:34.200
No Stylin wants to know, when will there be another Pimpin' Hoes party?

03:05:34.200 --> 03:05:37.920
He's referring to my birthday party, which he wasn't at, so I don't know how he knows

03:05:37.920 --> 03:05:44.400
this, but I think someone he talks to a lot was part of the brains behind that party.

03:05:44.400 --> 03:05:48.760
Maybe for someone else's birthday, I don't know.

03:05:48.760 --> 03:05:54.040
Maybe for my next birthday, I'd love to have another Pimpin' Hoes party.

03:05:54.040 --> 03:05:58.140
Pimino's party, it was my birthday and some folks came over here on a Sunday morning and

03:05:58.140 --> 03:06:01.340
surprised me and they all dressed like hoes and pimps.

03:06:01.340 --> 03:06:05.060
They brought over cake and it was kind of like a Hawaiian Pimps and Hoes party actually

03:06:05.060 --> 03:06:11.060
because they were wearing Hawaiian coconut boobs and little leis, colored rainbow leis

03:06:11.060 --> 03:06:12.060
and stuff.

03:06:12.060 --> 03:06:13.060
It was fun.

03:06:13.060 --> 03:06:14.360
We had chicken and waffles.

03:06:14.360 --> 03:06:17.620
We had Eggos and Popeye's chicken.

03:06:17.620 --> 03:06:21.460
By the way, live on the webcam, the ferret eats Loki's head.

03:06:21.460 --> 03:06:22.460
Hooray.

03:06:22.460 --> 03:06:30.220
Alright, guys, guess what? It's time to wrap up the show. Thank God this week's show went

03:06:30.220 --> 03:06:34.180
okay unlike last week's show which we're writing off and forgetting about forever. It's time

03:06:34.180 --> 03:06:39.820
for me to go around to collect the final thoughts. Let's start with Bradley. Does he have a microphone

03:06:39.820 --> 03:06:49.820
over there? Jamie. Have you ever really looked at your toes? They look weird. Yeah, they

03:06:49.820 --> 03:06:53.780
They do look weird.

03:06:53.780 --> 03:06:57.060
I'm not Asian, and I don't know how to use chopsticks.

03:06:57.060 --> 03:06:58.060
Thank you, Puppy.

03:06:58.060 --> 03:06:59.060
Erin.

03:06:59.060 --> 03:07:04.740
Uh, thanks to me, Puppy has now learned how to pick up Mike and Ike candies with his chopsticks.

03:07:04.740 --> 03:07:06.740
But I'm still not Asian.

03:07:06.740 --> 03:07:10.460
We realize that, but now you're one step closer to being Asian!

03:07:10.460 --> 03:07:11.460
Woohoo!

03:07:11.460 --> 03:07:16.460
I actually like that one.

03:07:16.460 --> 03:07:19.540
Logie, your final thought?

03:07:19.540 --> 03:07:22.500
I solder.

03:07:22.500 --> 03:07:25.020
Great.

03:07:25.020 --> 03:07:33.300
Uh, my final thought is, um, I hope I don't decide to flake on the show next week, because

03:07:33.300 --> 03:07:36.220
the Castro Street Fair does sound tempting.

03:07:36.220 --> 03:07:37.220
What on Sunday?

03:07:37.220 --> 03:07:38.220
Next Sunday, yeah.

03:07:38.220 --> 03:07:40.580
I'm thinking about flaking on the show, but I don't know.

03:07:40.580 --> 03:07:42.180
Don't worry, I'll fill in your part.

03:07:42.180 --> 03:07:43.180
We'll see.

03:07:43.180 --> 03:07:44.180
We'll see.

03:07:44.180 --> 03:07:45.180
I can...

03:07:45.180 --> 03:07:46.180
We'll see.

03:07:46.180 --> 03:08:13.680
I'm having way too much fun with the webcam.

03:08:13.680 --> 03:08:17.840
The final word of the show, I'm going to give it to Bradley because he never talks and I

03:08:17.840 --> 03:08:19.920
want him to give the final word tonight.

03:08:19.920 --> 03:08:20.920
Terraforming.

03:08:20.920 --> 03:08:25.440
You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

03:08:25.440 --> 03:08:29.800
Orange Lounge Radio is hosted by Dark Sakura, Sky and Loki.

03:08:29.800 --> 03:08:32.160
We expect you a nice play again.

03:08:32.160 --> 03:08:35.840
And now, here's your fortune cookie message of the day.

03:08:35.840 --> 03:08:37.140
Pardon me.

03:08:37.140 --> 03:08:38.320
Now it begins.

03:08:38.320 --> 03:08:39.840
Who all here is evil?

03:08:39.840 --> 03:08:40.840
Sound off.

03:08:40.840 --> 03:08:41.840
I'm evil.

03:08:41.840 --> 03:08:42.840
I'm evil.

03:08:42.840 --> 03:08:44.040
No, you are not.

03:08:44.040 --> 03:08:46.040
Oh, I am, too!

03:08:46.040 --> 03:08:50.740
You're as harmless as a baby's... butt.

03:08:50.740 --> 03:08:51.540
Zorak?

03:08:51.540 --> 03:08:52.540
Well, he is.

03:08:52.540 --> 03:08:54.240
I'm not a baby's butt.

03:08:54.240 --> 03:08:57.740
Brack, I'm going to have to go with Zorak on this one.

03:08:57.740 --> 03:09:01.140
You simply don't have the mental capacity to be evil.

03:09:01.140 --> 03:09:02.140
See?

03:09:02.140 --> 03:09:03.240
I don't get it.

03:09:03.240 --> 03:09:07.440
You see, Brack, you have to be able to come up with, oh, say, plots against the universe.

03:09:07.440 --> 03:09:12.440
You have to hatch evil plans to conquer planets and be just plain mean most of the time.

03:09:12.440 --> 03:09:14.940
You're just too nice.

03:09:14.940 --> 03:09:19.540
I forget how to be mean, not if radiation half-lipotomized me.

03:09:19.540 --> 03:09:25.640
Hey, I've got an idea. Let Zorak teach you how to be mean.

03:09:25.640 --> 03:09:28.140
Oh, man. Do I have to?

03:09:28.140 --> 03:09:29.840
Yes, you have to.

03:09:29.840 --> 03:09:32.240
Okay, Bragg, repeat after me.

03:09:32.240 --> 03:09:33.540
Space ghost.

03:09:33.540 --> 03:09:34.940
Space ghost!

03:09:34.940 --> 03:09:37.240
I will destroy you.

03:09:37.240 --> 03:09:40.140
I will destroy you, if you don't mind.

03:09:40.140 --> 03:09:42.440
I will destroy you!

03:09:42.440 --> 03:09:44.540
Oh, I'm sorry, wait, I'll get it.

03:09:44.540 --> 03:09:45.840
I will destroy you!

03:09:45.840 --> 03:09:48.440
I will destroy you!

03:09:48.440 --> 03:09:51.340
All right! I will destroy you!

03:09:51.340 --> 03:09:54.040
You, and your little dog, too.

03:09:54.040 --> 03:09:57.440
You and your little dog!

03:09:57.440 --> 03:10:00.540
Hey, I like this dog.

03:10:00.540 --> 03:10:02.740
Francine is a good puppy!

03:10:02.740 --> 03:10:05.240
No, that was just a threat.

03:10:05.240 --> 03:10:07.640
You wanna hurt Francine?

03:10:07.640 --> 03:10:16.120

03:10:38.480 --> 03:10:45.480
Yeah, tell me about it.

03:10:45.480 --> 03:10:47.320
Thanks for listening and we'll see you next week.

03:11:15.480 --> 03:11:19.480
Alright, we're in the Orange Launch Radio after birth.

03:11:19.480 --> 03:11:21.480
As promised, we won't make you wait any longer.

03:11:21.480 --> 03:11:24.360
Here it is one more time overloaded lesson two

03:12:51.480 --> 03:13:11.600
Okay, we're going to be adding that song into our rotation, by the way on Orange Launch

03:13:11.600 --> 03:13:13.040
Radio's Bamante Music and More program.

03:13:13.040 --> 03:13:16.520
So if you like that and can't get enough of it, don't worry, you'll get to hear more very

03:13:16.520 --> 03:13:17.640
soon.

03:13:17.640 --> 03:13:19.560
Welcome to the Orange Launch Radio Afterbirth.

03:13:19.560 --> 03:13:23.560
You are a scary woman, Miss Erin, with your whip.

03:13:23.560 --> 03:13:26.560
When's going to be another tournament where you can beat me up?

03:13:26.560 --> 03:13:27.560
I don't know.

03:13:27.560 --> 03:13:28.560
I don't know.

03:13:28.560 --> 03:13:29.560
There isn't.

03:13:29.560 --> 03:13:33.560
Well, if she has tooth any time soon, she'll probably end up being a cell driver there.

03:13:33.560 --> 03:13:34.560
Yeah, probably.

03:13:34.560 --> 03:13:40.560
Well, see the thing is, I haven't, there haven't been any real good NorCal tournaments coming

03:13:40.560 --> 03:13:41.560
out.

03:13:41.560 --> 03:13:46.560
You know, after, after the last year barrage of tournaments, it was kind of tired it out

03:13:46.560 --> 03:13:48.560
and now it's just, well.

03:13:48.560 --> 03:13:51.520
I'm kind of sad that I heard about the tournament in nickel city today

03:13:51.760 --> 03:13:54.560
They were having a puzzle fire tournament and only one person showed up

03:13:55.120 --> 03:13:57.120
Oh, man, I played him today and beat him

03:13:58.560 --> 03:14:04.960
No, did you go no I played no I played you know, what's his name that was going to be there, uh, forget his name

03:14:05.760 --> 03:14:09.440
Um, but anyways, yeah, um, so we played him and I won

03:14:10.000 --> 03:14:13.600
But because he made a mistake and uh, but it was I don't know

03:14:13.600 --> 03:14:25.600
I think it would be cool to have a puzzle fighter tournament because I know people in the Bay Area are pretty hardcore in that stuff, but I don't know how a DDR tournament is going to work out too well there.

03:14:27.600 --> 03:14:31.600
Alright, anything else we want to share in the afterbirth? Jamie, have anything?

03:14:31.600 --> 03:14:37.600
Go to www.fanimatrix.net

03:14:37.600 --> 03:14:39.600
They have a pretty cool...

03:14:39.600 --> 03:14:43.600
Well, go to BitTorrent. They have BitTorrent links.

03:14:43.600 --> 03:14:47.600
Anyways, they have BitTorrent links for the movie.

03:14:47.600 --> 03:14:55.600
It's a ten minute, or about ten minute fan film that's done by professional actors, professional stuntmen, special effects and whatnot, cinematography.

03:14:55.600 --> 03:15:01.960
There's kind of like a practice movie forum and a fan movie and it's basically a bunch of New Zealand actors

03:15:01.960 --> 03:15:03.640
You know doing this

03:15:03.640 --> 03:15:08.580
Kind of prequel to the matrix is pretty sweet. So you should go check that out. They're talking about doing

03:15:09.100 --> 03:15:14.000
Sequels and stuff later on but it's the first movie is called Phantom Matrix

03:15:14.000 --> 03:15:26.000
and it's called run program and it's pretty cool so that's www.fanandmaketricks.net

03:15:26.000 --> 03:15:29.000
and yeah

03:15:29.000 --> 03:15:34.000
alright I think that's going to wrap up the after birth unless anyone else has something they want to say

03:15:34.000 --> 03:15:36.000
I will destroy you

03:15:36.000 --> 03:15:37.000
thank you for having me

03:15:37.000 --> 03:15:39.000

03:15:41.000 --> 03:15:43.000
ok bye

03:15:43.000 --> 03:15:49.000
Alright, until next week, thanks guys. As promised, way in the beginning of the show, we're going to do the night-style soundtrack.

03:15:49.000 --> 03:15:54.000
Just a random order, you guys, so hopefully the song you want will come up soon.

03:15:54.000 --> 03:15:58.840
Good night you guys, thanks for supporting Orange Lounge Radio, as always we really appreciate

03:15:58.840 --> 03:15:59.840

I gotta give it to the king

03:26:28.860 --> 03:26:45.200
Water

03:28:58.860 --> 03:29:01.900
R

03:29:01.900 --> 03:29:04.900

03:29:04.900 --> 03:29:07.900

03:29:25.900 --> 03:29:31.900
This is the end of the video, thank you so much for watching, and I'll see you in the next one.

03:29:55.900 --> 03:30:08.460
Here always comes the times when everything is down

03:30:08.460 --> 03:30:14.200
And it seems hard to find all the paths To get us like the hope

03:30:14.200 --> 03:30:18.620
And when the dreams come true comes reality

03:30:18.620 --> 03:30:23.980
So keep your head up and try to hold your spirit

03:30:23.980 --> 03:30:29.580
Right when you get the place you'll see the sky

03:30:29.580 --> 03:30:33.980
And fly high in the air

03:30:33.980 --> 03:30:38.980
Bring out your hands, through the clouds

03:30:38.980 --> 03:30:44.480
Cast away because there's light in your soul

03:30:44.480 --> 03:30:48.280
And it's bound to fall somewhere

03:30:48.280 --> 03:30:53.780
So reach out to the clouds, try to cast

03:30:53.780 --> 03:30:55.780
Very sad

03:30:55.780 --> 03:30:58.780
But your heart and your soul

03:30:58.780 --> 03:31:00.780
See a thing
