00:00.000 --> 00:16.000
Toto, I have a feeling we're not in Kansas anymore.

00:16.000 --> 00:21.280
You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio, the Lonnie Togg and then some.

00:21.280 --> 00:24.480
Uh, mostly the and then some part of that.

00:24.480 --> 00:29.160
Orange Lounge Radio is created by a bunch of potty-mouthed adults.

00:29.160 --> 00:34.160
Orange Lounge may contain sexual, perverted, and mildly retarded content.

00:34.160 --> 00:38.160
You probably shouldn't let your children listen to Orange Lounge radio.

00:38.160 --> 00:40.160
Yes, I will spank your child.

00:40.160 --> 00:42.160
If you're not going to do your job, goddammit, I will.

00:47.160 --> 00:49.160
Well, here's my big opening.

00:49.160 --> 00:51.160
A sphincter says what?

00:51.160 --> 00:53.160
I'm super thanks for asking.

00:53.160 --> 00:56.160
Oh, you little bitch troll from hell.

00:56.160 --> 00:58.160
What am I doing here?

00:58.160 --> 01:00.160
Oh no!

01:00.160 --> 01:02.160
Dodge this.

01:02.160 --> 01:04.160
This is a tasty burger.

01:04.160 --> 01:06.160
Look, you stupid bastard, you've got no arms left!

01:06.160 --> 01:08.160
It's a house? Look!

01:08.160 --> 01:10.160
It's a flesh wound.

01:10.160 --> 01:12.160
Searching for a boy in high school is useless.

01:12.160 --> 01:16.160
It's searching for meaning in a polished order.

01:16.160 --> 01:21.160
Oh yeah? Well, I hope your babies look like monkeys.

01:21.160 --> 01:23.160
Dark Sakura.

01:23.160 --> 01:24.160
I've had a sniff.

01:24.160 --> 01:25.160
Skye.

01:25.160 --> 01:27.160
But I'm playing it for the bartender, so suffer.

01:27.160 --> 01:29.160
I hate you!

01:29.160 --> 01:31.160
Orange Lounge Radio

01:31.160 --> 01:37.160
We're live! This is episode 60 for September 14th, 2003.

01:37.160 --> 01:44.160
You're tuned into the Bimani scene's most late show of all things Bimani.

01:44.160 --> 01:52.160
My name is Loki, and well, Rob's not here because he's a slacker.

01:52.160 --> 01:54.160
He is a slacker.

01:54.160 --> 01:56.160
We're on time, where is he?

01:56.160 --> 01:59.160
We're gonna, you know, let's start with the fuckies of the week.

01:59.160 --> 02:01.160
Dear Rob, no.

02:01.160 --> 02:07.160
Okay, and in this corner, the happiest bunny on the farm, Dark Sakura.

02:07.160 --> 02:09.160
Hi, I have a sandwich.

02:09.160 --> 02:11.160
It's tasty.

02:11.160 --> 02:14.160
I have cookies, too, and I'm going to maul anyone who touches them.

02:14.160 --> 02:15.160
Cool.

02:15.160 --> 02:17.160
And in this corner, we have Rob.

02:17.160 --> 02:20.160
Hi, I'm Rob. I'm not here right now.

02:20.160 --> 02:22.160
Please take a message.

02:22.160 --> 02:24.160
BEEP BEEP

02:52.160 --> 02:59.160
you see me? And also, um, been away for a while, our, um, correspondent from the People's

02:59.960 --> 03:06.960
Republic of Davis, Puppy. Oh, and speaking of tardiness himself, here comes, uh oh, this,

03:07.440 --> 03:12.440

03:41.920 --> 03:49.040
to stop that you have cookies cookies what kind of cookies not yours by the

03:49.040 --> 03:52.360
way everybody well you guys already met but Jamie hasn't met Jamie this is Joey

03:52.360 --> 03:57.180
Joey Jamie listeners this is Joey hey how's it going

03:57.180 --> 04:04.160
Joey listeners okay so um we should take a break yes we should I think we should

04:04.160 --> 04:07.160
We should take that opening break that we usually do right about now.

04:07.160 --> 04:15.160
We're going to start off with this break with the first few MP3s I find.

04:15.160 --> 04:17.160
So we've got, looks like...

04:17.160 --> 04:18.160
Wait, here, here, here.

04:18.160 --> 04:19.160
Hey! Oh, you got it?

04:19.160 --> 04:21.160
Yeah.

04:21.160 --> 04:27.160
This is going to be pretty much random stuff, so yeah.

04:27.160 --> 04:30.160
Anyways, um, yeah, enjoy.

05:27.160 --> 05:34.160
But love's pain, he's got an opportunity to not try again

05:34.160 --> 05:38.160
But when she caught his eye, ain't no man to fight for peace

05:38.160 --> 05:41.160
He knew he had something left for him

05:41.160 --> 05:45.160
But no, he was in the mood for talking

05:45.160 --> 05:48.160
So he began to play the game

05:48.160 --> 05:52.160
Before he knew it, he had told her how much he'd been learning

05:52.160 --> 05:55.160
Though he was hoping she was not the same

05:55.160 --> 06:00.160
Could it be the kind of way that I'm thinking after all of this time?

06:00.160 --> 06:02.160
Could you please fill up?

06:02.160 --> 06:06.160
She says, boy, you don't have to look no more

06:06.160 --> 06:10.160
I'll give the love you need to your father and the guarantee

06:10.160 --> 06:13.160
I'd like to know, boy, I'm a blind lady

06:13.160 --> 06:16.160
Counting out for things so good I am the killer

06:16.160 --> 06:20.160
And when you wake up late thinking it's a dream

06:20.160 --> 06:23.160
So touch me, boy, you know you can count on me

06:23.160 --> 06:52.200
Baby, a kind lady that will never leave you lonely

09:52.200 --> 10:21.840
Hello everybody and welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 60 in progress

10:21.840 --> 10:33.800
person. I'm a little late. I was a couple minutes late. Sorry guys. My bad. Blame traffic.

10:33.800 --> 10:39.120
You know what? The traffic in, nobody can hear you anyway and that's a good thing. The

10:39.120 --> 10:44.480
traffic in, where the hell was that? Where 680 meets, Fairfield. Fairfield was horrible

10:44.480 --> 10:50.280
because one guy crashes on the side of the road and everybody has to turn their head

10:50.280 --> 10:53.400
and see if they can look at a dead body, never fails.

10:53.400 --> 10:57.040
Ooh, I think I see an arm! Exactly, exactly.

10:57.040 --> 11:01.240
It looks kind of severed. I'm very proud of you guys getting things

11:01.240 --> 11:04.800
going anyway, though. I mean, not that Jamie hasn't done it before, certainly, because

11:04.800 --> 11:08.200
I remember we took off for L.A. for a couple of times.

11:08.200 --> 11:11.680
And although Loki picked... And everyone decided to abandon me to go downstairs

11:11.680 --> 11:18.680
and watch the biography of Ron Jeremy. And even though Loki picked the chicken dance

11:18.680 --> 11:27.600
first break music. I forgive him anyway. It was cute. It was a nice deviation. Yeah,

11:27.600 --> 11:34.400
it was a good deviation from a seven-minute version of Kind Lady. I mean, don't get me

11:34.400 --> 11:38.880
wrong, I love Kind Lady, but shit, there's only so much of that song I can take. You

11:38.880 --> 11:45.280
just feel the disco groove or something. So, I know we have a lot to talk about in

11:45.280 --> 11:49.360
this segment tonight. We could fill up a good hour a show in this right here. So I think

11:49.360 --> 11:52.700
we need to play How Was Your Day, How Was Your Week, because, my God, there's a lot

11:52.700 --> 11:59.360
to talk about today. I haven't even seen Jamie since, like, last Sunday maybe? Have I seriously

11:59.360 --> 12:04.280
not seen you since last Sunday? Yes. That's the first. Isn't that weird? Yeah. That's

12:04.280 --> 12:08.680
kind of weird. Usually Jamie and I hang out. My week was very retarded. Well then let's

12:08.680 --> 12:15.200
start with you, Jamie. How was your day and how was your week? Very retarded. How so?

12:15.200 --> 12:27.140
My week was really dull at work and I was on antibiotics all week which had me not able

12:27.140 --> 12:31.980
to eat anything and then my inhaler that made me all shaky and this other stuff that's like

12:31.980 --> 12:40.060
sorting sorting snorting like fire tastes like burning it sucked it's like

12:40.060 --> 12:46.340
it's like snorting vomit flavored jelly bellies like the Harry Potter ones ew I

12:46.340 --> 12:55.100
think we still have some no puppy oh let's try it well there's a dinner for a

12:55.100 --> 13:00.660
month and a half for God's sake we need to get those off of there

13:00.660 --> 13:06.260
But anyway, it was basically dull.

13:06.260 --> 13:10.820
I came home feeling too tired, too sick to do much of anything.

13:10.820 --> 13:17.300
And then to top all that off, my car starts behaving very badly, as in stopping every

13:17.300 --> 13:18.300
time I stop.

13:18.300 --> 13:19.860
I'm going to be getting into my car later.

13:19.860 --> 13:24.940
I kind of remember that because I remember when we were driving places, it was doing

13:24.940 --> 13:27.500
that vroom, vroom thing that my old car used to do.

13:27.500 --> 13:30.060
But it was really doing it very badly.

13:30.060 --> 13:32.640
Finally, it does it at every stop.

13:32.640 --> 13:33.640
I decided Friday...

13:33.640 --> 13:37.440
I was going to take it in Saturday anyway to have it looked at, but I just did it Friday

13:37.440 --> 13:40.200
afternoon because I was so tired of it.

13:40.200 --> 13:48.440
I went in on Saturday to go check it out, and apparently the compression's all messed

13:48.440 --> 13:49.440
up.

13:49.440 --> 13:50.440
The one side's good.

13:50.440 --> 13:51.940
The other side is good.

13:51.940 --> 13:59.680
The middle is sunken on my engine, like at an incline, sunken.

13:59.680 --> 14:04.380
All right, here's the total cost of what I've spent on my car.

14:04.380 --> 14:08.180
I have had little tiny things replaced.

14:08.180 --> 14:15.760
I spent nearly $800 having the brakes fixed, catalytic converter put in, a new front axle,

14:15.760 --> 14:20.640
and then, not to mention, the oxygen sensor I had replaced much earlier.

14:20.640 --> 14:25.900
And now they're saying it's going to cost $1,800 to fix my car.

14:25.900 --> 14:28.020
And they likely need a new engine and a back end rebuild.

14:28.020 --> 14:29.020
Who'd you take it to?

14:29.020 --> 14:34.580
I went to Meinecke. Normally Meinecke is really good. The guy there, he'll at least tell me

14:34.580 --> 14:38.840
what's up and offer to let me go take it somewhere else. Now, he worked a couple of hours on

14:38.840 --> 14:42.700
my car, which was supposed to be $65 an hour. He only charged me $65 for the diagnostic

14:42.700 --> 14:45.980
and that was it. That's cool. And I think he tweaked the engine because I had only stalled

14:45.980 --> 14:49.840
once on the way home. You know, you should see, because remember

14:49.840 --> 14:53.780
Loki's story, I don't know if this was last week, but you had the brake issue going on

14:53.780 --> 14:55.140
Oh, that was this one.

14:55.140 --> 14:56.140
My bad.

14:56.140 --> 14:57.140
I don't want to ruin this.

14:57.140 --> 15:00.700
What we're going to do is we're just going to do a patch job on the engine and make it

15:00.700 --> 15:01.700
drivable.

15:01.700 --> 15:03.780
But in the meantime, Julie's offered to let me use her car.

15:03.780 --> 15:05.100
Oh, what a sweetheart.

15:05.100 --> 15:07.420
Well, her old car, which went fine.

15:07.420 --> 15:11.900
But we tried to take off the dash last night to put in a fan switch because her old fan

15:11.900 --> 15:12.900
switch doesn't work.

15:12.900 --> 15:13.900
And we just gave up.

15:13.900 --> 15:15.660
We're like, we're going to let the men's do it.

15:15.660 --> 15:19.700
So Dan and them were supposed to go over it, but I couldn't get ahold of her all day.

15:19.700 --> 15:26.700
Okay, normally when I hear, oh, you fucker, I look over and go, what?

15:26.700 --> 15:31.700
Yeah, but it wasn't directed at you. No, I don't mean me. I was meaning what goes out.

15:31.700 --> 15:35.700
I'm just kidding. Okay, shut up. I'm just going to stare at you.

15:35.700 --> 15:42.700
The last piece, piece number 47 of 47 of BeatMania Complete Mix 2 was 68% done. Now it's a 404

15:42.700 --> 15:48.780
on the internet might add that each piece is 50 megs in size

15:50.140 --> 16:02.460
dough dough anyway um so my saturday was composed of um lots of uh i went to meanie's cafe because

16:02.460 --> 16:07.500
i've never eaten there before they were pretty good uh i bought a car battery go to sam's club

16:07.500 --> 16:16.620
up there $47. I bought the fan switch. I bought a multi-tool. I think it's in my pocket still.

16:16.620 --> 16:24.020
I have a multi-tool. I feel handy. Hold my multi-tool up. Put it on the camera for me.

16:24.020 --> 16:29.080
Go up there. No, stay over there and put it on the camera. Geez, because I'm lazy and

16:29.080 --> 16:39.400
or not. That's my multi-tool. It's really neat. It was $3, so that was the cheapest

16:39.400 --> 16:46.880
thing I bought all day. Then we went to TGI Fridays last night. After Julie and I were

16:46.880 --> 16:53.040
in the middle of the massive game of Phantasy Star, I'm like, give me that. Give me my knife.

16:53.040 --> 17:00.120
I'm still into my Ride and Rock online, however, I am now back in the highly addictive world

17:00.120 --> 17:03.000
of PS opium.

17:03.000 --> 17:07.280
You chose to take your PSO break right when I started playing, and now that I'm done with

17:07.280 --> 17:08.280
it-

17:08.280 --> 17:09.280
I'm playing it on Xbox now.

17:09.280 --> 17:13.160
I think you're avoiding me is what it is.

17:13.160 --> 17:15.520
I'm not avoiding you, Rob.

17:15.520 --> 17:18.000
I'm going to go in here.

17:18.000 --> 17:19.000
No.

17:19.000 --> 17:23.200
But that's basically it, and I haven't heard anything about getting the Centro today, so

17:23.200 --> 17:28.460
I may have to take the Tercel out again, I'm very upset that the VIC Viper has finally

17:28.460 --> 17:36.340
crashed and burned, but I'm thinking of getting, um, sort of looking at an Echo, a 2003 Echo,

17:36.340 --> 17:39.580
they're blue, and if I get one it's going to be the Twinbee.

17:39.580 --> 17:42.020
I'm a nerd.

17:42.020 --> 17:49.020
And I haven't touched any Bimani all week.

17:49.020 --> 17:50.020
Good for you.

17:50.020 --> 17:51.020
No story.

17:51.020 --> 17:55.020
Because you always have to ask, since technically we're supposed to be a Bimani show.

17:55.020 --> 18:00.100
We worked some more on my message board today.

18:00.100 --> 18:01.820
I'm going to give myself a shameless plug on this.

18:01.820 --> 18:04.020
I was going to say, do you want to give yourself a shameless plug?

18:04.020 --> 18:09.820
Roleplay.darksacra.com, sign up there if you want to run a free-form RPG on the message

18:09.820 --> 18:11.220
board, sign up.

18:11.220 --> 18:15.340
I will set it up for you and make you a moderator of your own forum.

18:15.340 --> 18:20.540
And if you want to discuss any role plays, coming soon I'm going to be implementing in

18:20.540 --> 18:26.060
the MO RPG forum on there for Phantasy Star Online, Ragnarok, and I may even put a stupid

18:26.060 --> 18:27.920
little puzzle of pirates on there.

18:27.920 --> 18:28.920
You know what though?

18:28.920 --> 18:33.180
Jared's got a great puzzle pirates forum, so it's all right.

18:33.180 --> 18:40.260
And I'm going to put one on for actual video games, and yes, we're going to have the Battle

18:40.260 --> 18:46.500
Royal RPG discussion forum. We could do a message board style one while we're working

18:46.500 --> 18:50.340
on the tabletop one too. I actually signed up for your message board

18:50.340 --> 18:54.240
the other day finally. When you called and you wanted me to relay a message, it kind

18:54.240 --> 18:58.020
of reminded me, oh I should go sign up for her board.

18:58.020 --> 19:01.860
My boards are really awesome. Sign up for them, everybody master, I'll steal your soul

19:01.860 --> 19:06.980
and feed it to my cat so she can poop it in her litter box.

19:06.980 --> 19:07.980
What a lovely thought.

19:07.980 --> 19:08.980
Thank you.

19:08.980 --> 19:09.980
I'm done.

19:09.980 --> 19:10.980
Okay.

19:10.980 --> 19:11.980
Then let's go on to Bradley.

19:11.980 --> 19:12.980
Hello, by the way.

19:12.980 --> 19:13.980
How are you?

19:13.980 --> 19:14.980
I'm okay.

19:14.980 --> 19:15.980
How was your week?

19:15.980 --> 19:16.980
How was your day?

19:16.980 --> 19:17.980
Pretty uneventful.

19:17.980 --> 19:18.980
I'm looking for a job.

19:18.980 --> 19:19.980
That's basically everything I did this week.

19:19.980 --> 19:33.980
And then I went to Cuzar yesterday, and we'll probably talk about it later with the group.

19:33.980 --> 19:34.980
Yes.

19:34.980 --> 19:35.980
Cuzar.

19:35.980 --> 19:42.980
I don't know if I did anything else interesting at all, only played one game of DDR and that

19:47.500 --> 19:54.500
was yesterday. Jamie you did that under my name, now I get

19:55.980 --> 20:02.620
all the credit for that kick. I don't care, you are always nice when you

20:02.620 --> 20:09.060
kick people? Or you say something silly? I'm just like, because you suck. Or die or something.

20:09.060 --> 20:15.740
So they know it's me anyway. Anyway, okay. I'm sorry to so rudely interrupt

20:15.740 --> 20:18.100
you. It's not much to interrupt if I'm not saying

20:18.100 --> 20:21.500
much of anything right now. Was there any interesting things you did this

20:21.500 --> 20:25.340
week? Any Bamani or accomplishments or anything? No.

20:25.340 --> 20:31.700
No? It's all good. Okay, well, moving on then. Puppy?

20:31.700 --> 20:32.700
I got a microphone again.

20:32.700 --> 20:33.700
Yes.

20:33.700 --> 20:34.700
Okay.

20:34.700 --> 20:36.360
So what are we talking about again?

20:36.360 --> 20:37.360
How was your week?

20:37.360 --> 20:38.360
How was your day?

20:38.360 --> 20:39.660
Oh, let's see.

20:39.660 --> 20:47.380
For my week, I didn't work this week because I was busy spending every single day packing

20:47.380 --> 20:51.860
all my stuff into large cardboard boxes so I can throw it in the back of a truck and

20:51.860 --> 20:57.140
drive up to Davis and move into my new apartment, which is actually pretty good.

20:57.140 --> 20:59.380
But hooray for not being in the dorms anymore, huh?

20:59.380 --> 21:00.380
Yes.

21:00.380 --> 21:04.660
moved out of the dorms in my own apartment, it was like, oh my god, life is great.

21:04.660 --> 21:12.180
I know. I actually have my car now, too, so I can, you know, leave whenever I need to.

21:12.180 --> 21:19.460
And that's good. And then I went to Scandia earlier today and tried to play 2DX, but the

21:19.460 --> 21:27.780
damn figure on the right side has to be broken. The damn key keeps, like, freaking out or

21:27.780 --> 21:37.460
something and then I played like one game of DDR and got too tired haha old I

21:37.460 --> 21:43.260
know I'm getting old damn it must be it must be college dear God what happened

21:43.260 --> 21:47.340
to your leg did you get that like camping huh you've got like are those

21:47.340 --> 21:51.460
bites all of your leg oh no that's not bites oh I'm sorry I thought they were

21:51.460 --> 21:56.500
bites they kind of look like it but they do they're not bites they're just it's

21:56.500 --> 22:02.420
just been having skin issues. Oh, I'm sorry. I thought because you went camping two weeks

22:02.420 --> 22:05.940
ago, and when I went camping once, I got bit by so many bugs my legs looked like that.

22:05.940 --> 22:11.580
Well, I know better than to go out camping and not have hugs break. Listen! I don't want

22:11.580 --> 22:15.860
to go there. I know what to do about camping, because I've been going camping at the same

22:15.860 --> 22:19.740
place for like 12 years, so I know the place. Well, don't I feel like an ass? I'm sorry.

22:19.740 --> 22:31.860
And now I'm watching Loki type something on the TV computer thing.

22:31.860 --> 22:37.120
Any other exciting events you want to share about your week?

22:37.120 --> 22:38.620
Pretty much before yesterday.

22:38.620 --> 22:42.360
Oh, oh, I did get to go to Ikea for the first time.

22:42.360 --> 22:44.480
Ikea is so studly.

22:44.480 --> 22:45.480
I love going to Ikea.

22:45.480 --> 22:46.480
It's fucking scary, okay?

22:46.480 --> 22:47.480
Why do you think Ikea's scary?

22:47.480 --> 22:48.480
IKEA is scary.

22:48.480 --> 22:50.400
Big blue furniture Death Star.

22:50.400 --> 22:51.400
That's what it is.

22:51.400 --> 22:54.720
It's not a big blue furniture Death Star, it is, it is the cool.

22:54.720 --> 22:55.720
I love IKEA.

22:55.720 --> 22:56.720
Like, it's...

22:56.720 --> 22:58.720
Can I have one of those?

22:58.720 --> 22:59.720
Yes.

22:59.720 --> 23:02.960
Okay, IKEA is beautiful, because it's just everything in a box.

23:02.960 --> 23:08.560
You can get a chair in a box, a lamp in a box, recliner in a box, couch in a box, tea

23:08.560 --> 23:12.560
in a box, whatever you want, you can get it in a box, take it home, put it together.

23:12.560 --> 23:14.560
But that's the problem, you have to put the damn shit together.

23:14.560 --> 23:15.880
It works like Legos.

23:15.880 --> 23:16.880
Can't you read instructions?

23:16.880 --> 23:38.520
I bought a desk and a dresser and a TV stand for my apartment and now I spent all of Saturday

23:38.520 --> 23:40.080
putting that crap together.

23:40.080 --> 23:42.720
There was not one word in the instructions.

23:42.720 --> 23:49.720
It was some weird transgender-looking character pointing out things on the pictogram.

23:49.720 --> 23:56.720
It's weird, it's like the Swedes are trying to take us over.

23:56.720 --> 23:58.720
Those don't know the Swedish on IKEA.

23:58.720 --> 24:03.720
I don't think they have IKEA outside of California, I could be wrong.

24:03.720 --> 24:05.720
I thought there was IKEA outside of California.

24:05.720 --> 24:07.720
Obviously in Sweden.

24:07.720 --> 24:08.720
Is there?

24:08.720 --> 24:16.020
There's actually one over in Schomburg, Illinois, outside of Chicago, and the only reason why

24:16.020 --> 24:20.360
I know this is because I've got a couple of friends that live in Schomburg, and that IKEA

24:20.360 --> 24:22.740
blows the one in Emerville out of the water.

24:22.740 --> 24:29.240
It is like seven stories tall, and it's huge.

24:29.240 --> 24:33.640
That IKEA place is so big.

24:33.640 --> 24:35.440
Size is everything at IKEA.

24:35.440 --> 24:38.440
I just like to say, seven stories.

24:38.440 --> 24:39.600
That's nuts.

24:39.600 --> 24:43.240
Wow, I'm having to fan myself to give out that.

24:43.240 --> 24:47.000
OK, but they need to learn that particle board is not

24:47.000 --> 24:50.920
the best material for furniture.

24:50.920 --> 24:54.720
OK, I put my dresser together at the helm of my roommate,

24:54.720 --> 24:57.320
and we tried to move it into my closet.

24:57.320 --> 24:59.320
And as we're lifting it up, snap,

24:59.320 --> 25:01.720
there goes a board on the front of the dresser.

25:01.720 --> 25:04.000
I think you put it together right.

25:04.000 --> 25:06.440
She built it like a Riri.

25:06.440 --> 25:11.280
OK, Navi, who's on the show quite often, me and him,

25:11.280 --> 25:12.480
we went to IKEA one day.

25:12.480 --> 25:15.360
Me, him, and Pixie Dust, the Orange Lounge wench,

25:15.360 --> 25:18.200
we all went, I'm sorry, she's the madam, not the wench, my bad.

25:18.200 --> 25:19.560
We all went to IKEA one day.

25:19.560 --> 25:20.520
We had a big trip.

25:20.520 --> 25:22.280
We went to the Jelly Belly Factory and went to IKEA.

25:22.280 --> 25:24.200
This was like three months ago, right?

25:24.200 --> 25:27.040
And we bought a chair that Navi had seen there

25:27.040 --> 25:28.760
like three months ago he really wanted.

25:28.760 --> 25:30.520
So we bought it, and then we all took it back to his house

25:30.520 --> 25:31.480
and put it together.

25:31.480 --> 25:32.920
It was so much fun because you had

26:02.920 --> 26:09.920
Okay, sex topic just went over my head. Rocking and little bits of salt falling over, or popping.

26:12.360 --> 26:16.720
Don't rock this boat. But still, I mean, particle board does not

26:16.720 --> 26:20.760
make good furniture, and they need to figure out a better way to put the damn thing together

26:20.760 --> 26:26.200
with, I mean, they give you a bunch of little wooden pegs that you have to hammer into holes

26:26.200 --> 26:27.840
to hold it together. That's it.

26:27.840 --> 26:31.680
It's like Tinker Toys. I know, it is, and that's what's so fucking

26:31.680 --> 26:36.400
IKEA is tinker toys for grown-ups.

26:36.400 --> 26:40.040
My roommate said they're trying to lower the productivity of Americans so Swedish can take

26:40.040 --> 26:41.720
over the country.

26:41.720 --> 26:44.880
Why would Swedish people want this country?

26:44.880 --> 26:48.880
I don't fucking know!

26:48.880 --> 26:52.140
I don't know.

26:52.140 --> 26:55.880
Oh, yeah, I got all this stuff put together.

26:55.880 --> 26:59.120
It's all about the watches. Watches and clocks.

26:59.120 --> 27:04.400
There was no... They're gonna drive us insane by putting clocks everywhere.

27:04.400 --> 27:06.720
Okay, that did not look right. Did you ever see a hook?

27:06.720 --> 27:08.780
Just like that.

27:08.780 --> 27:12.040
That did not look right from this angle.

27:12.040 --> 27:16.080
You're a sicko.

27:16.080 --> 27:18.520
Yeah, too bad we're not on TV. Anyway...

27:18.520 --> 27:22.240
Oh, we do have the cam. We have the cam, I forgot. And the cam updates even faster now.

27:22.240 --> 27:23.960
Yeah, but it's not pointing in your direction.

27:23.960 --> 27:26.320
Oh, I forgot to whore out our chat room. My bad.

27:26.320 --> 27:27.320
Do it!

27:27.320 --> 27:28.320
Did you guys already do it?

27:28.320 --> 27:29.320
Do it!

27:29.320 --> 27:30.320
Do it!

27:30.320 --> 27:33.860
www.calibomani.com, click on Orange Lounge and click on chat.

27:33.860 --> 27:36.560
While you're there, visit our forums, because no one posts in our forums.

27:36.560 --> 27:37.860
That makes us sad.

27:37.860 --> 27:41.840
And the LiveJournal Community username Orange Lounge.

27:41.840 --> 27:45.240
And sooner or later you guys are going to update that site.

27:45.240 --> 27:46.680
Right!?

27:46.680 --> 27:52.560
We made a purchase last week, I should say, and we're planning to put that purchase to

27:52.560 --> 27:53.920
you soon.

27:53.920 --> 28:02.000
kind of purchase would this be? Swedish stock. Yeah, Swedish stock. A Swedish bank account.

28:02.000 --> 28:10.760
Okay. We're going to the fjords. Jamie says we're going to the fjords. Okay. Other than

28:10.760 --> 28:15.280
that, I went to meet up with a couple of you guys at Qsar last night. We'll talk about

28:15.280 --> 28:19.240
Qsar in a minute. Yeah, okay. Because that's a whole topic of its own right there. And

28:19.240 --> 28:22.560
I bet.

28:22.560 --> 28:24.280
Is there anything you want to say about your week, Joey?

28:24.280 --> 28:26.400
I'll probably cover most of it, but...

28:26.400 --> 28:28.400
Yeah, you probably will.

28:28.400 --> 28:29.400
Is there anything?

28:29.400 --> 28:31.400
Well, I'll go back.

28:31.400 --> 28:33.060
Okay, go back.

28:33.060 --> 28:35.260
I'll go back.

28:35.260 --> 28:42.620
Last week, I went to Bodega Bay, and there was about seven of us friends, and we took

28:42.620 --> 28:46.700
a trip, it's a yearly trip that we always go to Bodega Bay, ran out of house out there,

28:46.700 --> 28:47.840
and uh...

28:47.840 --> 28:49.340
stave

28:49.340 --> 28:50.600
four days three nights

28:50.600 --> 28:51.540
really fun

28:51.540 --> 28:53.320
houses right on the ocean

28:53.320 --> 28:55.560
and uh... so we just take it there for

28:55.560 --> 28:57.960
you know the four days

28:57.960 --> 28:59.020
and uh...

28:59.020 --> 29:02.420
drink up and

29:02.420 --> 29:05.880
so that's what it's almost like that movie we saw

29:05.880 --> 29:07.480
where they went to the cabin

29:07.480 --> 29:09.380
partied party yes

29:09.380 --> 29:13.520
you guys are a party animal we went and saw cabin fever yes we went and saw cabin fever

29:13.520 --> 29:14.860
two days ago

29:14.860 --> 29:16.860
Most disturbing film I think I've ever seen.

29:16.860 --> 29:17.860
Very disturbing.

29:17.860 --> 29:18.860
I will agree.

29:18.860 --> 29:19.860
I don't get disturbed by movies.

29:19.860 --> 29:20.860
I know.

29:20.860 --> 29:22.860
I'm not going to talk too much about it, but...

29:22.860 --> 29:23.860
What?

29:23.860 --> 29:24.860
What's this?

29:24.860 --> 29:25.860
Eh.

29:25.860 --> 29:26.860
Second most disturbing film.

29:26.860 --> 29:27.860
Okay, I'm sorry.

29:27.860 --> 29:28.860
Second most disturbing film I've seen.

29:28.860 --> 29:29.860
We'll be the first.

29:29.860 --> 29:33.220
That Ichi the Killer that Loki was talking about last week.

29:33.220 --> 29:34.780
I'm sorry.

29:34.780 --> 29:35.780
That's too much.

29:35.780 --> 29:39.580
I mean, if there's a line, that movie crossed it.

29:39.580 --> 29:40.580
I don't know.

29:40.580 --> 29:43.620
We saw 28 Days Later yesterday, and that was pretty disturbing, too.

29:43.620 --> 29:44.620
I like 28 Days Later, though.

29:44.620 --> 29:45.620
I'd already seen it.

29:45.620 --> 29:47.620
By the way, we brought you a movie.

29:47.620 --> 29:48.620
Thanks.

29:48.620 --> 29:50.060
No, no, no, no, no, no.

29:50.060 --> 29:57.880
The most disturbing movie ever is freaking Manos, The Hands of Fate.

29:57.880 --> 29:58.880
You know what?

29:58.880 --> 30:00.460
Even Suicide Circle, that's just bad.

30:00.460 --> 30:01.460
That's just bad.

30:01.460 --> 30:02.460
Not disturbing.

30:02.460 --> 30:08.020
Suicide Circle, a little strange, but not disturbing.

30:08.020 --> 30:12.460
It's creepy and thought provoking, but not really disturbing unless you happen to have

30:12.460 --> 30:16.660
fixations about, you know, flesh!

30:16.660 --> 30:19.780
Well, there's Captain Fear for you. A lot of flesh tearing.

30:19.780 --> 30:23.260
Yeah, it was nasty. It was pretty brutal. Tim Curry in legend.

30:23.260 --> 30:27.580
Disturbing. Yeah, I'll agree with that. But so great.

30:27.580 --> 30:31.500
Anyway, sorry to interrupt. Anyway,

30:31.500 --> 30:35.740
what else? So that was that. That was a cool trip. Came back, didn't want to go back

30:35.740 --> 30:37.740
home, and

30:37.740 --> 30:39.100
that's why I took a day

30:39.100 --> 30:43.460
a vacation before my vacation, and a day vacation after my vacation, because I was told it was

30:43.460 --> 30:44.460
time to go home.

30:44.460 --> 30:45.460
That's right.

30:45.460 --> 30:46.460
Nobody ever wants to go back to work after vacation.

30:46.460 --> 30:47.460
That's right.

30:47.460 --> 30:51.020
So I took Monday off, and then I took two hours before Tuesday to go in, so I had a

30:51.020 --> 30:52.020
six-hour day on Tuesday.

30:52.020 --> 30:53.800
So anyway, it was good.

30:53.800 --> 30:55.040
Worked all week.

30:55.040 --> 30:56.040
That was hellish.

30:56.040 --> 30:59.380
Does anybody here like their job?

30:59.380 --> 31:00.380
Show of hands.

31:00.380 --> 31:01.380
Like their job.

31:01.380 --> 31:02.380
Well, I love my job.

31:02.380 --> 31:03.380
You don't work.

31:03.380 --> 31:04.380
Yes, you.

31:04.380 --> 31:05.380
I know you work.

31:05.380 --> 31:12.820
What the hell are you talking about, I don't work?

31:12.820 --> 31:13.820
But you're back in school!

31:13.820 --> 31:16.060
Well, I'm going to be working.

31:16.060 --> 31:17.060
Where?

31:17.060 --> 31:18.060
I don't know yet.

31:18.060 --> 31:20.860
I still have to go out this weekend.

31:20.860 --> 31:21.860
Like right now?

31:21.860 --> 31:22.860
Right this second?

31:22.860 --> 31:23.860
You're not working?

31:23.860 --> 31:24.860
No.

31:24.860 --> 31:29.420
But I am still on the payroll at Golfland.

31:29.420 --> 31:31.260
Alright, my bad.

31:31.260 --> 31:33.660
And then later on I'll deal with the whole thing.

31:33.660 --> 31:40.420
And how you enjoy your job working at a golf land, I'll never know, especially after what

31:40.420 --> 31:42.420
happened to you this summer, which I want to talk about later.

31:42.420 --> 31:46.300
Yes, I will talk about it later, but it's not Roseville and there's not hundreds of

31:46.300 --> 31:49.620
thousands of snotty shithead kids to deal with.

31:49.620 --> 31:52.620
And no water slides.

31:52.620 --> 31:55.140
To the love of God, do not bring up each of the killer mid-show.

31:55.140 --> 31:59.700
Oh no, please don't.

31:59.700 --> 32:00.700
All I need to...

32:00.700 --> 32:01.700
Yeah.

32:01.700 --> 32:03.140
So I'll have to say yes, I do love my job.

32:03.140 --> 32:08.380
I mean, I've been there for over nine years now, and I don't see myself going anywhere

32:08.380 --> 32:09.380
any time soon.

32:09.380 --> 32:11.340
To be honest, I actually like my job a lot.

32:11.340 --> 32:15.900
Like four months ago, before I was promoted, I'd be complaining about it a lot, but right

32:15.900 --> 32:16.900
now, love it.

32:16.900 --> 32:19.100
I really do.

32:19.100 --> 32:21.940
Looking forward to a fat pay increase.

32:21.940 --> 32:23.780
Mine's busy now that peak season's almost over.

32:23.780 --> 32:31.020
All you college students just need to hurry up and get in school and stop calling.

32:31.020 --> 32:35.360
I can't really say that because I've talked to so many neat and cool people.

32:35.360 --> 32:40.480
Your typical college student is smarter than your typical mortgage person.

32:40.480 --> 32:41.480
Typical homeowner.

32:41.480 --> 32:42.480
Really?

32:42.480 --> 32:43.480
Let's go there.

32:43.480 --> 32:44.480
Typical.

32:44.480 --> 32:48.480
I, for one, am a homeowner.

32:48.480 --> 32:53.800
I used to work in mortgage customer service and you have no idea how many people I had

32:53.800 --> 32:56.520
to explain how to read their loan documents.

32:56.520 --> 32:57.520
It's not funny.

32:57.520 --> 32:58.680
Well, it's, yeah.

32:58.680 --> 33:00.160
I would say they are kind of complicated.

33:00.160 --> 33:10.760
I see people who sign with an X. That's pretty bad. Signing with an X, that's

33:10.760 --> 33:13.820
pretty bad. You know what's even better on your driver's

33:13.820 --> 33:18.040
license? I had friends that had this too. They signed it and then they put a happy face

33:18.040 --> 33:22.700
next to it. It's those people that are so pretty that they always sign everything with

33:22.700 --> 33:28.500
a happy face. That's just being sixteen. If I ever worked retail, I would say, I'm sorry,

33:28.500 --> 33:34.140
this doesn't match your driver's license you need to put a happy face they need to take

33:34.140 --> 33:40.240
all the happy people and put them on an island 42 people at a time put these nice pretty

33:40.240 --> 33:44.780
shiny colors on them and give them all a weapon and have them kill each other off in three

33:44.780 --> 33:50.100
days electro shock oh no battle royale have you seen battle royale no i haven't no i have

33:50.100 --> 33:57.780
not seen battle royale yet that's it next time are you going to de-virginize me i'm

33:57.780 --> 34:18.260
I'm going to bring over the DVD and have you watch it sometime.

34:18.260 --> 34:26.180
Japanese movie put out what, 99? 94, put out 94. Oh, I don't think it's that old, dear.

34:26.180 --> 34:31.540
Is it? Well, whenever it was put out. It's 2000, okay. Well, regardless, it's not that

34:31.540 --> 34:36.540
old is the point. So, it's not that old and they put a bunch of students on an island

34:36.540 --> 34:40.260
and when we say students, we're talking like seventh and eighth grade kids, ninth grade

34:40.260 --> 34:44.060
kids and it's some kind of government program where they basically say, you guys have to

34:44.060 --> 34:48.540
kill each other, and the last one standing gets to go home. And it's really violent,

34:48.540 --> 34:52.460
because, you know, it's not American movies, so they're not subject to all the, you know,

34:52.460 --> 34:58.340
R rating stuff. What? It had a theatrical release in Europe. See, but the British don't

34:58.340 --> 35:02.220
care. You can show tit on TV in Britain, and no one cares. But, basically, it's really

35:02.220 --> 35:07.100
violent, and kids kill each other, and it's great, because kids get really annoying, especially

35:07.100 --> 35:31.620
I

35:31.620 --> 35:33.460
like picturing them as junior high school kids.

35:33.460 --> 35:36.460
Don't ruin my fantasy!

35:36.460 --> 35:38.460
You're sick!

35:38.460 --> 35:41.460
You're a sick man.

35:41.460 --> 35:43.460
Playing DDR as long as I have.

35:43.460 --> 35:49.460
You get to hate kids real fast.

35:49.460 --> 35:50.460
Anyway, hi.

35:50.460 --> 35:51.460
I love those things.

35:51.460 --> 35:52.460
Anything else?

35:52.460 --> 35:54.460
Oh, don't encourage them.

35:54.460 --> 35:57.460
Don't encourage them.

35:57.460 --> 35:58.460
You know what?

35:58.460 --> 36:00.460
I still love this thing.

36:00.460 --> 36:01.460
Yeah, baby.

36:01.460 --> 36:07.460
I think I would start bringing him all of a sudden.

36:07.460 --> 36:09.460
Don't you have to take a nap?

36:09.460 --> 36:10.460
Actually, I am quite tired.

36:10.460 --> 36:11.460
I've been driving all goddamn day.

36:11.460 --> 36:12.460
Rob, you're on a time-out.

36:12.460 --> 36:13.460
Go in the room.

36:13.460 --> 36:14.460
Uh-oh.

36:14.460 --> 36:15.460
I have the microphone!

36:15.460 --> 36:16.460
You are cool.

36:16.460 --> 36:17.460
You like the ferrets.

36:17.460 --> 36:18.460
He just sneezed.

36:18.460 --> 36:19.460
I can't believe he just sneezed.

36:19.460 --> 36:29.460
Rob is making the give me hand, trying to take the microphone away from me.

36:29.460 --> 36:32.100
Oh, and look at the eye on the floor!

36:32.100 --> 36:33.100
Jimmy's here!

36:33.100 --> 36:34.100
She's pouting!

36:34.100 --> 36:35.100
Look at that lip!

36:35.100 --> 36:36.100
My goodness.

36:36.100 --> 36:37.100
Rob's being cute, okay?

36:37.100 --> 36:38.100
I have to give it back.

36:38.100 --> 36:39.100
I win.

36:39.100 --> 36:40.100
What is this, Ferret?

36:40.100 --> 36:45.100
We got present with that Ferret, and that was funny.

36:45.100 --> 36:47.820
That was a flying Ferret, though.

36:47.820 --> 36:52.340
Those are... are... special.

36:52.340 --> 36:53.340
Special!

36:53.340 --> 36:54.340
No, this is special.

36:54.340 --> 36:57.820
One of these was, like, long gone, and we couldn't find it, anyway.

36:57.820 --> 36:58.820
It's right here.

37:58.820 --> 38:01.580
a couple of years, so Joey was like, let's go today.

38:01.580 --> 38:02.580
I'm like, OK.

38:02.580 --> 38:03.780
So we went to the beach today.

38:03.780 --> 38:05.500
We went over to Stinson Beach.

38:05.500 --> 38:07.460
Stinson Beach over on Highway 1.

38:07.460 --> 38:10.420
Which is right just north of San Francisco.

38:10.420 --> 38:13.740
And you have to take the most windiest road to get there.

38:13.740 --> 38:15.700
It's so fun to drive.

38:15.700 --> 38:18.900
Luckily, I didn't have to drive.

38:18.900 --> 38:20.860
Oh, I was having fun.

38:20.860 --> 38:22.820
He was holding onto the goddamn door.

38:22.820 --> 38:25.780
I was not holding onto the goddamn door.

38:25.780 --> 38:28.740
Did you master the inertia drift while driving?

38:28.740 --> 38:34.380
The INERTIA Drift.

38:34.380 --> 38:40.360
Oh, I love racing games.

38:40.360 --> 38:41.360
I love racing games.

38:41.360 --> 38:43.540
I will bring Initial D over next Sunday then.

38:43.540 --> 38:44.540
Cool.

38:44.540 --> 38:45.540
I said it last week and I will say it this week.

38:45.540 --> 38:49.240
F, Initial D, F0 is where it is at.

38:49.240 --> 38:53.120
F0 is much better.

38:53.120 --> 38:55.920
I know I would.

38:55.920 --> 39:02.200
Okay, so, the windy roads, we went to the beach, and the beach was fun, we took about

39:02.200 --> 39:04.600
a gazillion pictures, and there's, uh...

39:04.600 --> 39:06.080
Yeah, we did take a lot of pictures, but...

39:06.080 --> 39:10.920
Thank you for taking all sorts of, like, disgusting pictures of me trying to climb the rock, like,

39:10.920 --> 39:11.920
bending over, trying to...

39:11.920 --> 39:14.360
Oh, they were, you guys all love this!

39:14.360 --> 39:18.080
I got some blackmail pictures!

39:18.080 --> 39:21.800
I'm trying to climb these rocks, because I wanted a picture of me on top of the rock,

39:21.800 --> 39:23.280
so I could take a picture and say, I rock.

39:23.280 --> 39:25.760
Oh, and I just kept on snapping, as he was climbing, it was great!

39:25.760 --> 39:29.480
And so he's making a movie out of it, he just keeps on snapping, filling up my camera.

39:29.480 --> 39:33.360
I get it back, I'm like, who took 48 pictures?

39:33.360 --> 39:34.360
I did.

39:34.360 --> 39:39.880
Anyway, so we had fun at the beach, and I still have sand all over my feet though, and

39:39.880 --> 39:43.040
the tides suck, I got sand on my pants and everything.

39:43.040 --> 39:45.180
The water was 60 degrees, it was quite lovely.

39:45.180 --> 39:49.480
But this is why we're late, then, you know, we kind of, we knew how long it would take

39:49.480 --> 39:52.700
us to get home from the freeway, I think, but we didn't account for the slow-ass grandma

39:52.700 --> 39:58.940
drivers on the curvy roads who actually take it at the speed limit and you can't pass them.

39:58.940 --> 40:06.300
Like five miles the whole trip and I'm like, there's passing lanes, turnouts, use them.

40:06.300 --> 40:09.500
So we got stuck behind them. Grandmas or grandpas listening out there,

40:09.500 --> 40:13.580
you know, turnouts, use them. And not only did that slow us up, but then

40:13.580 --> 40:19.340
when we got to Vacaville or whatever that was, not Vacaville, Fairfield, there was all

40:19.340 --> 40:26.860
the traffic, and if it had not been for that accident, we would have been here on time.

40:26.860 --> 40:31.100
So for all those of you that get in car accidents, stop it and learn how to drive.

40:31.100 --> 40:40.060
You know what's actually interesting is that a lot of the time it's not rubberneck drivers

40:40.060 --> 40:42.580
that cause the traffic to slow down. Really?

40:42.580 --> 40:49.580
Often the Highway Patrol actually sends out units to create traffic breaks.

40:49.580 --> 40:54.580
It happened a couple days ago when I was on my way back from IKEA.

40:54.580 --> 40:56.580
They probably do that on major accidents, right?

40:56.580 --> 41:11.580
Actually, no. As I was going down 580 heading home from IKEA, there was a minor two car accident on the right-hand shoulder right near a freeway entrance.

41:11.580 --> 41:16.860
and then two highway patrolmen busted ahead of traffic and created a traffic break and

41:16.860 --> 41:22.540
actually stopped, slowed down everyone to about 15 miles an hour as they passed the

41:22.540 --> 41:25.720
accident site, then pulled off the road and let everyone go.

41:25.720 --> 41:29.180
Which makes sense, so the cleanup crew and everything can take care of it.

41:29.180 --> 41:33.300
I've seen that happen twice in Sacramento actually, same intersection, same time of

41:33.300 --> 41:39.540
day. Like we were coming back from the club, on the highway, coming back from downtown,

41:39.540 --> 41:43.620
same intersection, Fulton and Eighty, I've seen two huge wrecks there, and the policemen,

41:43.620 --> 41:47.940
they drive across all the lanes of traffic, and they do it really slow to pace the rest

41:47.940 --> 41:51.580
of the traffic, because you can't get by them, because you don't want to pass a cop anyway.

41:51.580 --> 41:55.980
But he's driving across all the lanes of traffic. That would be a great racing game.

41:55.980 --> 41:58.820
Pace car driver! Pace car driver!

41:58.820 --> 42:05.820
Oh my god, that would be beautiful. Then you could do it to your own beat.

42:05.820 --> 42:12.980
That's funny, VidPower is like speed limit, what's that?

42:12.980 --> 42:18.860
Something that is posted on the highway that you're supposed to follow, but you notice

42:18.860 --> 42:26.300
that on the highways it'll say maximum speed of 65 miles an hour.

42:26.300 --> 42:30.460
But in the city it has just speed limit, 35, speed limit, 40.

42:30.460 --> 42:31.460
So it's not the max.

42:31.460 --> 42:36.380
You can go 65 out of 40, but it's just not the maximum speed limit, you know?

42:36.380 --> 42:39.140
Have you ever told that to a cop?

42:39.140 --> 42:40.400
Actually no.

42:40.400 --> 42:42.220
What about where they have maximum and minimums?

42:42.220 --> 42:45.540
I'd love for them to go after the people who are not going the minimum.

42:45.540 --> 42:47.300
That would be beautiful.

42:47.300 --> 42:51.060
They pull over people going 50 into 65, I mean, come on.

42:51.060 --> 42:53.760
Joey and I were talking about this on the drive home today too.

42:53.760 --> 42:58.340
We decided that there needs to be a lane just for special people like us.

42:58.340 --> 42:59.580
Screw the special people.

42:59.580 --> 43:00.740
Well, it should be Joey's lane.

43:00.740 --> 43:01.740
Hello?

43:01.740 --> 43:04.820
You know, I don't have to deal with these idiot morons that don't know how to drive.

43:04.820 --> 43:05.820
You know what?

43:05.820 --> 43:09.500
Or how about a lane that you have to pass an IQ test to be able to drive in?

43:09.500 --> 43:11.560
Like, here's the test.

43:11.560 --> 43:12.560
You know what?

43:12.560 --> 43:14.220
The higher the IQ, the stupider they get.

43:14.220 --> 43:15.220
I don't get it.

43:15.220 --> 43:21.100
When you see an accident on the side of the road, do you A, stop to help, B, slow down

43:21.100 --> 43:26.300
to look at dead bodies, C, drive faster?

43:26.300 --> 43:31.300
If you ask for a C, you get to drive in the special lane.

43:31.300 --> 43:36.300
Of course, you could just have flying cars because you don't have to deal with highways.

43:36.300 --> 43:38.300
That would be so much simpler.

43:38.300 --> 43:41.300
Thank you, George Jetson.

43:41.300 --> 43:48.300
Being in the position that I am in, if I see something like that, I would have to actually call CHP to make sure somebody's on the way.

43:48.300 --> 43:50.300
Aww, you're a good Samaritan.

43:50.300 --> 43:51.300
I wouldn't stop and help.

43:51.300 --> 43:52.300
Do it from your cell phone while you're driving.

43:52.300 --> 43:53.300
I would have to call CHP.

43:53.300 --> 43:54.300
That's just me.

43:54.300 --> 44:06.140
I think that's all I want to say, because we'll talk about QSAR later.

44:06.140 --> 44:08.140
I'm sure Loki might get into it or whatever.

44:08.140 --> 44:10.940
We need to take a break before we talk about that, but Loki, do you want to talk about

44:10.940 --> 44:13.220
your week, your day?

44:13.220 --> 44:18.540
Sure, why not, you know, since I'm just sitting here.

44:18.540 --> 44:22.420
This week wasn't all that important, you know, it wasn't like I had my birthday or anything,

44:22.420 --> 44:26.300
and uh, yeah, I'm twenty-three.

44:26.300 --> 44:27.820
No one died except for John Reeder.

44:27.820 --> 44:28.820
I cleaned.

44:28.820 --> 44:29.820
Oh my goodness.

44:29.820 --> 44:32.820
Yeah, but I didn't kill Johnny Cash.

44:32.820 --> 44:35.820
John Reeder, though, was me.

44:35.820 --> 44:36.820
There you go.

44:36.820 --> 44:37.820
Oh man.

44:37.820 --> 44:38.820
Johnny Cash.

44:38.820 --> 44:41.820
He had one foot in the grave anyway, I mean, when his wife died.

44:41.820 --> 44:47.100
Hey, hey, I, you know, I was really depressed, and I normally don't get depressed for famous

44:47.100 --> 44:48.100
people.

44:48.100 --> 44:53.180
Don't get me wrong, Johnny Cash, great man, talented man, but his wife died four months

44:53.180 --> 44:54.180
ago.

44:54.180 --> 44:55.620
He's been having all sorts of problems anyway.

44:55.620 --> 44:56.620
It was time.

44:56.620 --> 44:59.900
Bless him for trying to keep going on, but the same thing happened with my grandma and

44:59.900 --> 45:00.900
my grandpa.

45:00.900 --> 45:01.900
It's just too hard.

45:01.900 --> 45:02.900
His spouse goes, you're next.

45:02.900 --> 45:04.220
You get sick often.

45:04.220 --> 45:07.540
This is what happened with my aunt.

45:07.540 --> 45:15.900
When her father died, her mother passed within six hours of him, and she was in perfect health.

45:15.900 --> 45:20.120
I guess that, you know, I'm glad that they're all, you know, united again, but it was very

45:20.120 --> 45:21.120
depressing.

45:21.120 --> 45:22.120
Anyway, I'm sorry, happy birthday.

45:22.120 --> 45:26.400
So, what you're saying is Johnny Cash was so distraught over the fact that John Ritter

45:26.400 --> 45:29.840
died that he, too, showed up?

45:29.840 --> 45:31.480
I don't know about that.

45:31.480 --> 45:32.840
I don't know.

45:32.840 --> 45:36.000
Anyways, so yeah, I didn't do too much this week.

45:36.000 --> 45:42.800
I took two days off, so I had a four-day weekend, and Thursday I went and got my breaks done,

45:42.800 --> 45:48.640
I took it over to the mechanic that happens to be just a few feet from our door, literally

45:48.640 --> 45:49.640
right over the fence.

45:49.640 --> 45:50.640
How convenient!

45:50.640 --> 45:56.200
So I took it over there, and I found out that I got my brakes done, it didn't need to really

45:56.200 --> 45:59.480
be done, but I went ahead and did the back brace because it was kind of a birthday gift

45:59.480 --> 46:01.880
for my mom.

46:01.880 --> 46:07.360
So I found out that Speedy Oil Change lied about my brakes needing to be done, they just

46:07.360 --> 46:08.360
wanted more service from me.

46:08.360 --> 46:09.360
You know what?

46:09.360 --> 46:16.000
have that just speedy in general or any kind of those quickie loops don't go

46:16.000 --> 46:22.280
that's all I have to say well and they broke my axle they see hello to my axle

46:22.280 --> 46:27.360
so that I'd have to come back and have it replaced there too you know I can't

46:27.360 --> 46:31.000
prove that they did break it but I think they broke it a little bit more because

46:31.000 --> 46:37.640
right after I got my tune up there my car started you know grinding when I

46:37.640 --> 46:42.880
I turned right, which is from my right front axle going out.

46:42.880 --> 46:45.560
But that's not going to cost that much to replace,

46:45.560 --> 46:47.400
so that's cool.

46:47.400 --> 46:49.760
And they're working my pad some more.

46:49.760 --> 46:51.320
I have them all framed now.

46:51.320 --> 46:52.440
They're all pretty.

46:52.440 --> 46:56.480
And yes, they're sitting on the patio.

46:56.480 --> 47:02.320
And yesterday, or right now, Friday, I

47:02.320 --> 47:05.640
went and bought a TV, a 27-inch TV

47:05.640 --> 47:07.400
that I'll be using in my cabinet.

47:07.400 --> 47:10.240
And let me just say that was the most entertaining thing

47:10.240 --> 47:12.520
to watch for anyone else that was out there

47:12.520 --> 47:16.040
in that parking lot, me trying to get that in my car.

47:16.040 --> 47:18.200
It wouldn't fit in the back door.

47:18.200 --> 47:20.000
It wouldn't fit in the trunk.

47:20.000 --> 47:22.300
So I ended up having to break the box open,

47:22.300 --> 47:26.000
cram the TV into the front seat, and pad it

47:26.000 --> 47:28.120
with the phone that was inside there,

47:28.120 --> 47:31.280
strap the seat belt around it, and hope to God

47:31.280 --> 47:35.560
that when I turn corners that it doesn't crush me when it rolls.

47:35.560 --> 47:36.680
So that was fun.

47:36.680 --> 47:40.680
And then getting it in the door as the neighbors are standing there watching me going,

47:40.680 --> 47:43.680
Ugh, it's so heavy!

47:43.680 --> 47:45.680
And then, um, so I did that.

47:45.680 --> 47:48.680
Right, that's a quick hint.

47:48.680 --> 47:51.680
What else?

47:51.680 --> 47:54.680
Oh, yeah, then yesterday we went and played Cheez-Art,

47:54.680 --> 47:59.680
and I kicked ass and won every game, as usual.

47:59.680 --> 48:04.680
And there's some guy there that called me fat, and I laughed at him.

48:04.680 --> 48:06.080
That was so great.

48:06.080 --> 48:08.000
Bokey's like, that guy called me fat.

48:08.000 --> 48:11.480
And it was the guy that worked there.

48:11.480 --> 48:13.760
He was just pissed off that I was beaten up on him.

48:13.760 --> 48:16.080
But we ended up tying, and we shook hands at the end.

48:16.080 --> 48:18.600
That's all it's about, you know, just talking.

48:18.600 --> 48:19.480
What is this shit?

48:19.480 --> 48:20.520
That's not what I do.

48:20.520 --> 48:21.600
What are you talking about?

48:21.600 --> 48:22.720
Q's are that's what you do.

48:22.720 --> 48:23.220
You talk.

48:23.220 --> 48:24.000
That's gay.

48:24.000 --> 48:24.720
You talk shit.

48:24.720 --> 48:26.000
You talk shit all the time.

48:26.000 --> 48:27.720
And at the very end, you know, you just

48:27.720 --> 48:29.720
thank them for a good game, because that's what it is.

48:29.720 --> 48:32.160
Because the next game, they could be whooping up on you.

48:32.160 --> 48:34.600
And the game after that, you could be whooping on them.

48:34.600 --> 48:40.520
never know. It's just a different situation each time, so. What? I just don't talk to

48:40.520 --> 48:43.880
anybody and then I sneak up on them and poke my gun in their back and then fire and run

48:43.880 --> 48:49.320
away giggling. Well, then we started doing G stuff because the arena isn't built that

48:49.320 --> 48:54.880
well so the red headquarters, they didn't paint it too well and so we were tagging the

48:54.880 --> 48:58.160
headquarters from outside the headquarters because the plexiglass wasn't covered all

48:58.160 --> 49:04.160
the way. Lame. Let me just say, being on the team that was defeated by you, lame. Oh, shit.

49:04.160 --> 49:05.160
Oh, great.

49:05.160 --> 49:06.160
Sheet.

49:06.160 --> 49:07.160
Sheet.

49:07.160 --> 49:08.960
We were bouncing shots off the windows and stuff like that.

49:08.960 --> 49:13.080
I was actually on the other side of the arena, seeing the lights on the windows.

49:13.080 --> 49:14.080
Great stuff.

49:14.080 --> 49:15.080
So we did that.

49:15.080 --> 49:16.080
We had fun.

49:16.080 --> 49:21.920
Played some Cuzar, dropped some business cards off there, so hopefully someone picked them

49:21.920 --> 49:26.480
up that was listening to the show tonight, even though I don't think so.

49:26.480 --> 49:27.480
And that's it.

49:27.480 --> 49:28.840
There was no hicks there.

49:28.840 --> 49:29.840
I was surprised.

49:29.840 --> 49:30.840
No hicks at all.

49:30.840 --> 49:34.840
They knew we were coming and fled.

49:34.840 --> 49:39.440
But there was some guy that just gave Ryan, not puppy Ryan, but zero Ryan a hug out of

49:39.440 --> 49:40.440
nowhere.

49:40.440 --> 49:42.440
Some guy was hugging him goodbye.

49:42.440 --> 49:43.440
That's right.

49:43.440 --> 49:44.440
Really?

49:44.440 --> 49:45.440
The way it started...

49:45.440 --> 49:46.840
He said it wasn't the same guy.

49:46.840 --> 49:48.400
No, it wasn't the same guy.

49:48.400 --> 49:51.920
But the way it started, he came up and said goodbye to everybody.

49:51.920 --> 49:55.520
And then he wanted to ask some kind of questions.

49:55.520 --> 50:02.520
I think he was like, I don't know, religious or something, wanting to talk about God.

50:03.520 --> 50:20.520
Uh-oh. Uh-oh. I missed all that. Anyways. Moving on. Oops. Yeah. Oh well. Anyway, so then

50:20.520 --> 50:28.560
So then later on we left and then I came back here and I was exhausted and today I bought

50:28.560 --> 50:33.280
everything to convert all of our game systems over to S-Video and I bought a bunch of...

50:33.280 --> 50:42.200
I raped Radio Shack's little component cabinet and I took all their crimp connections for

50:42.200 --> 50:46.080
nine pin serial things for my cabinet and all that stuff and I got some pretty nifty

50:46.080 --> 50:51.360
stuff from the cabinet. But next week I'm going to be buying all the wood for the main

50:51.360 --> 50:59.200
cabinet and we'll hopefully have it built in under a month. So, yay.

50:59.200 --> 51:03.120
Okay, that was this week's edition of How Was Your Day, How Was Your Week. I want to

51:03.120 --> 51:05.840
talk a little more about Q's are when we come back and buy...

51:05.840 --> 51:06.840
Well, not now.

51:06.840 --> 51:09.960
Because it's time for a break. We've been talking for like 40 minutes straight here,

51:09.960 --> 51:10.960
so we're going to take a break.

51:10.960 --> 51:11.960
Okay, fine.

51:11.960 --> 51:17.600
I said so and I want to stretch so we will be you right back. You're listening Orange

51:17.600 --> 51:24.600
launch radio thank you

52:17.600 --> 52:33.600
Every night I look at the sky All you're leaving was blue

52:33.600 --> 52:40.600
Every night, every night

52:40.600 --> 52:48.600
Baby, if you want me to come back

52:57.600 --> 53:01.600
Every time I lose my self-control

53:01.600 --> 53:05.000
It feels like I can't let you go

53:05.000 --> 53:08.600
I'm at the point of no return

53:12.100 --> 53:15.600
Don't ever wanna come back down

53:15.600 --> 53:19.100
I'm not slow high above the ground

53:19.100 --> 53:22.600
You're stealing, I will always yell

53:24.800 --> 53:26.600
Kicking away

53:27.100 --> 53:28.400
I'm flying

53:28.400 --> 53:31.800
I'm gonna head for paradise

53:31.800 --> 53:33.800
Nothing to say

53:33.800 --> 53:35.400
I'm climbing

53:35.400 --> 53:39.400
And I wanna stay in my spirit tonight

54:05.400 --> 54:13.400
Keeps you alive

54:43.400 --> 54:49.400
In the barrio, you've gotta learn how to survive

54:49.400 --> 54:54.400
Cause you never know when it's your turn to take a dive

54:54.400 --> 55:00.400
So you go, you stay with your eyes in the back of your head

55:00.400 --> 55:06.400
You'll never know if you'll be alive or beaten

55:06.400 --> 55:12.400
That is one old savage who'll carry on midnight special

55:12.400 --> 55:17.400
Never leave, but without it Always better with a midnight version

55:17.400 --> 55:22.400
It's the dark of the street You never know who you're gonna be

55:22.400 --> 55:28.400
You're gonna need no more faith, you gotta make that good show

55:28.400 --> 55:52.400
Orange Lounge Radio, we put your thing down, flip it and reverse it.

55:52.400 --> 56:08.400
Hey, we're back. Hi, everybody. Yay, I'm in the chair. I did it all by myself, I'm so

56:08.400 --> 56:15.400
loud. And I have the ferret too. So what are we going to do? I don't know. Give us a mic

56:15.400 --> 56:18.000
and rub. Well, I wonder, because somebody in the chat room was asking over break, what

56:18.000 --> 56:25.960
What is Qsar? Actually, the place is Qsar with a Z and its laser tag, but the reason

56:25.960 --> 56:29.560
why we've been calling it Qsar tonight is because on our little receipt yesterday when

56:29.560 --> 56:34.200
we bought the games, it said Qsar. We were joking. Qsar is hee hee hee, you know, shit

56:34.200 --> 56:40.920
like that. But, what? Well, British was Quasar, wasn't it?

56:40.920 --> 56:45.920
Yeah. Isn't it called Quasar in Britain? Yeah. Jimmy's like, I'm not that big a dork,

56:45.920 --> 56:46.920
Okay.

56:46.920 --> 56:54.560
But I actually, you know what, I was talking about how much I suck at Qs are and Loki told

56:54.560 --> 56:56.560
me I had to shut up because I actually did pretty good.

56:56.560 --> 56:58.480
One game I came in second just behind Loki.

56:58.480 --> 56:59.480
I was happy.

56:59.480 --> 57:00.480
Yeah.

57:00.480 --> 57:04.760
It was the solo game too, because I just stood by the headquarters and every time Loki would

57:04.760 --> 57:07.680
shoot enough people that he could go for the headquarters, I'd be there to jump out and

57:07.680 --> 57:09.260
shoot them.

57:09.260 --> 57:12.920
I got the headquarters like three times, almost three times.

57:12.920 --> 57:17.720
I got it twice, and then I got tagged by Ryan at the very end.

57:17.720 --> 57:22.960
I was tagged, and the light was up, and because Black Lab was trying to shoot it, even...

57:22.960 --> 57:23.960
What?

57:23.960 --> 57:27.560
This chat needs to be scrolled down, sorry.

57:27.560 --> 57:29.560
Oh, der.

57:29.560 --> 57:37.480
Sorry to interrupt your story, keep going, my bad.

57:37.480 --> 57:52.480
Alright, anyways, so yeah, I was going to tag it for the second time, but probably didn't understand, I guess, the concept of supercharged, where you have to tag five people without getting tagged, then your gun goes in the rapid fire, then you can tag the headquarters, that's the only way you can tag it.

57:52.480 --> 58:03.480
So, he's standing there blocking me because I'm trying to, like, tag the headquarters, and here he's standing there, had I remembered that you can tag it from the outside, you know, that would have saved me a whole lot more time, but, you know.

58:03.480 --> 58:11.480
So no, I had to kind of get tagged a few times, but then I won, I guess.

58:11.480 --> 58:21.480
There was some tubby little kid there that was talking crap, and I beat him down.

58:21.480 --> 58:24.480
Then I was playing DDR later on, and he was like,

58:24.480 --> 58:28.480
Oh my God, you're good at QSR and DDR!

58:28.480 --> 58:30.480
I heard him say that!

58:30.480 --> 58:36.200
It was not there. That's funny. Yeah. Even I would have made fun of that. That's cool.

58:36.200 --> 58:42.120
It wasn't as bad as Skater Cowboy. Oh my God. Skater Cowboy was awful. Skater Cowboy was

58:42.120 --> 58:46.480
there last night. I would have laughed. We always think about Skater Cowboy when we think

58:46.480 --> 58:53.960
of Vacaville. I wasn't even there. Seriously, every time I go to Vacaville, I look for Skater

58:53.960 --> 58:58.560
Cowboy, but I don't think we'll ever meet him again.

58:58.560 --> 59:01.840
He's just rolling in the wind.

59:01.840 --> 59:07.840
With his cool custom-made DDR Freak skateboard that sucked.

59:07.840 --> 59:13.140
Jamie, do you know if DDR Freak has any officially licensed skateboarding products?

59:13.140 --> 59:14.760
Hell no.

59:14.760 --> 59:15.760
Just checking.

59:15.760 --> 59:23.100
I think the only official DDR Freak product there is are the shirts and then that's it.

59:23.100 --> 59:24.760
I thought there were stickers too.

59:24.760 --> 59:25.760
Maybe stickers, maybe.

59:25.760 --> 59:34.280
When you're a freak, you're a freak.

59:34.280 --> 59:38.000
the syringe?

59:38.000 --> 59:45.560
You know, I just hadn't been to play in so long, it's just like I kind of forgot what

59:45.560 --> 59:49.920
it was like, but those energizers kind of sucked for me, like I could never get my gun

59:49.920 --> 59:53.720
to energize right, and I don't know if it was just that I would keep shaking my gun

59:53.720 --> 59:57.480
in front of it when you had to hold it, but even when I held it, it wouldn't do anything.

59:57.480 --> 01:00:00.120
It was stupid, I didn't like that.

01:00:00.120 --> 01:00:02.480
I guess I'm very impatient.

01:00:02.480 --> 01:00:05.480
But it sucks we have to go all the way to Vacaville to play QZAR, because Laser Force

01:00:05.480 --> 01:00:06.480
is unacceptable.

01:00:06.480 --> 01:00:07.480
That's not laser tag.

01:00:07.480 --> 01:00:08.480
That's...

01:00:08.480 --> 01:00:09.480
Yeah, well...

01:00:09.480 --> 01:00:15.200
Yeah, believe it or not, we just drove by the damn, like, why is that place still open?

01:00:15.200 --> 01:00:16.200
It smells like pee.

01:00:16.200 --> 01:00:17.200
It smells like pee.

01:00:17.200 --> 01:00:20.520
You have to understand, because they're the number one laser force place since QZAR left.

01:00:20.520 --> 01:00:21.520
They were about to go under...

01:00:21.520 --> 01:00:23.520
They're the only laser force...

01:00:23.520 --> 01:00:24.520
Imagine...

01:00:24.520 --> 01:00:27.760
Well, Laser X is a count, but imagine, imagine if you will...

01:00:27.760 --> 01:00:31.440
Okay, Sun Splash is about on the same level as Laser Force, laser tag boy.

01:00:31.440 --> 01:00:37.420
talking like you know laser force was in the you know the quicksand going under

01:00:37.420 --> 01:00:41.660
no chance or survival whatsoever no chance to survive make your time yeah

01:00:41.660 --> 01:00:46.940
then all of a sudden you know Q's are leaves and gasps for air in this like

01:00:46.940 --> 01:00:51.540
barely alive and it comes back with a vengeance the only thing I like about

01:00:51.540 --> 01:00:56.220
laser force is I love the two-story arena concept I love because you know I

01:00:56.220 --> 01:01:00.300
love to play sniper so I love to sit there on the top and help help people at

01:01:00.300 --> 01:01:03.620
the bottom. Yes, I'm a camper and I'm proud of it.

01:01:03.620 --> 01:01:08.220
I wish we could go play Qsar in Ireland because their Irish rules rock.

01:01:08.220 --> 01:01:10.820
Irish rules. Can you club people with a gun? Can you drink

01:01:10.820 --> 01:01:15.540
and then play Qsar? Irish rules, there's no neck strap and there's

01:01:15.540 --> 01:01:19.460
running. Their arenas are huge and it's like running around in a huge, it's pretty much

01:01:19.460 --> 01:01:25.900
like playing paintball because it's just that, it's just crazy and it's the most tiring thing

01:01:25.900 --> 01:01:31.320
ever. We played Irish Rules one time when I was there on Tuesday night at that Cuzar

01:01:31.320 --> 01:01:38.600
in Vacaville and that was very dangerous. Whoa, what a liability. How did you get away

01:01:38.600 --> 01:01:42.500
with doing Irish Rules there? Well, gee, because they don't have any waiver

01:01:42.500 --> 01:01:48.820
cards. It doesn't matter anyways. That Cuzar runs so poorly. It's a joke. If anyone got

01:01:48.820 --> 01:01:52.820
hurt at all, stubbed to toe or whatever, you could just go and sue that place and it wouldn't

01:01:52.820 --> 01:01:53.820
matter.

01:01:53.820 --> 01:01:54.820
Hey kids!

01:01:54.820 --> 01:01:55.820
Hey kids!

01:01:55.820 --> 01:01:56.820
Wanna make money?

01:01:56.820 --> 01:02:04.500
Seriously, there's no waiver forms at all, so, I mean, you could.

01:02:04.500 --> 01:02:09.460
I should do that as a college student.

01:02:09.460 --> 01:02:13.540
Puppies are going to pay off his college loans by suing Cuzar, that's really great.

01:02:13.540 --> 01:02:17.780
My leg hurts today, maybe I should sue Cuzar.

01:02:17.780 --> 01:02:26.780
Okay, um, the show just kind of came to a screeching halt, I have nothing else to say.

01:02:26.780 --> 01:02:32.780
Sorry, I just saw that my, um, BeatMania Complete Mix 2 was done.

01:02:32.780 --> 01:02:33.780
Oh, aren't you special.

01:02:33.780 --> 01:02:35.780
You want to do the cage match now, Jamie?

01:02:35.780 --> 01:02:37.780
Yeah, I want to do the cage match.

01:02:37.780 --> 01:02:39.780
Alright, let me get over there and also set up a cage match.

01:02:39.780 --> 01:02:42.780
Alright, here, Loki, talk.

01:02:42.780 --> 01:02:52.780
So yeah, um, today, or actually not today, a few days ago they, um, finally released the, um, hard drive image of Beat Me at Complete Mix 2.

01:02:52.780 --> 01:02:59.780
And that was pretty cool. Bad puppy. Bad puppy.

01:02:59.780 --> 01:03:09.780
So anyways, yeah, I just downloaded it, all 47 parts of it, and, uh, now it's gonna unzip. Very slowly. It's gonna take a while.

01:03:09.780 --> 01:03:16.780
to make this room complete, you need to transfer to the other room.

01:03:39.780 --> 01:04:05.060
p0k3smot42o

01:04:05.060 --> 01:04:10.380
a big announcement. Go to your local GameStop and reserve your season 3 Transformers box

01:04:10.380 --> 01:04:16.260
set now so you can be cool like me. Cause I have mine reserved. Season 3 is the best

01:04:16.260 --> 01:04:23.260
season ever. We all aspire to be as cool as Jamie, don't we? Everybody in the world needs

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:28.960
to be as cool as me. You know what, I just met Jamie and Jamie is the coolest chick I've

01:04:28.960 --> 01:04:38.720
ever met so hey yeah I'm cool but I have a spirit I sent you a rawr file zero

01:04:38.720 --> 01:04:42.000
pre-show dot rawr

01:04:43.360 --> 01:04:47.680
because I was cool and decided to upload it so I didn't have to waste any more

01:04:47.680 --> 01:04:54.680
I endorse Wind Rar, not Winds Up.

01:04:54.680 --> 01:04:57.680
I have it! Here!

01:04:57.680 --> 01:05:17.680
The way the cage match works, if you want to vote for a Hollick, that's the first rule.

01:05:17.680 --> 01:05:26.680
Second rule, if you want to vote in the cage match, you have to get in our chat room, www.calibomani.com, click on Orange Lounge and click on chat, this is the way it works.

01:05:26.680 --> 01:05:32.680
Each of the three lovely hosts of this program, including myself, Sarca, and Loki, bring one song to the table.

01:05:32.680 --> 01:05:38.680
And you guys vote on your favorite song, and that song goes into rotation all week long on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:05:38.680 --> 01:05:43.680
However, if a song wins for a month straight, it gets taken out.

01:05:43.680 --> 01:05:52.680
and guess what I'm a little scared and last week's song that one is now

01:05:52.680 --> 01:05:56.800
halfway there last week's winner was Loki song that he picked two weeks ago

01:05:56.800 --> 01:06:01.920
but it's still winning and it's every little thing from the cyber trance album

01:06:01.920 --> 01:06:08.600
with face the change and this is the above and beyond and dirt devils remix

01:06:08.600 --> 01:06:12.640
so you only get a clip of it because it won last week but this song number one

01:06:12.640 --> 01:06:16.200
You can vote for tonight every little thing with face the changes. Here you go

01:07:42.640 --> 01:07:45.640
It's me and the kid who's in love

01:07:45.640 --> 01:07:48.640
Every hour I eat a pizza

01:07:48.640 --> 01:07:52.640
Gotta need a game, gotta get there

01:08:18.640 --> 01:08:23.320
did it, or what it's called but it's from Raiden. This is one of the best shooting games

01:08:23.320 --> 01:08:26.360
ever. I can fill you in on the rest of it because I'm going to read it right off of

01:08:26.360 --> 01:08:32.960
the MP3 here. It's Galantry, nobility of spirit. That's what it says. And if you have never

01:08:32.960 --> 01:08:37.160
played Raiden, go play Raiden DX because it's the best of the series. Thank you. Alright,

01:08:37.160 --> 01:08:44.160
So here's Jamie's pick. It's Ryza with Raiden Gallantry. Enjoy!

01:13:37.160 --> 01:13:53.160
kostjamrh And now we get to tear it apart or praise it lots.

01:13:53.160 --> 01:13:54.160
whatever you want to do.

01:13:54.160 --> 01:13:58.160
It was a really good remix, and the song that I initially picked had already been played,

01:13:58.160 --> 01:14:00.160
because I didn't notice the tracklist, and I just went,

01:14:00.160 --> 01:14:02.160
oh, this is from Wipeout, and put it in.

01:14:02.160 --> 01:14:04.160
I didn't even listen to it.

01:14:04.160 --> 01:14:09.160
So, this one, this one, I liked it.

01:14:09.160 --> 01:14:11.160
It's a good remix, and it's a great game, you know.

01:14:11.160 --> 01:14:13.160
Always been a big fan of the Raiden series,

01:14:13.160 --> 01:14:16.160
and figured a lot of people don't appreciate it that much, so I threw it in,

01:14:16.160 --> 01:14:19.160
so it gets an A to me.

01:14:49.160 --> 01:14:53.160
So I'll give it that. And Raiden is an underrated shooter, so I'll give you that too.

01:14:53.160 --> 01:14:57.160
But as a song itself, I love Raiden. I can't see giving it much more than that.

01:14:57.160 --> 01:15:01.160
We had a machine at our round table at Rock.

01:15:01.160 --> 01:15:05.160
As a song itself, I can't see giving it much more than like...

01:15:05.160 --> 01:15:09.160
A 6.66!

01:15:09.160 --> 01:15:13.160
A 5.723.

01:15:13.160 --> 01:15:17.160
Okay, uh, Bradley?

01:15:17.160 --> 01:15:24.160
pretty good but easy to know

01:15:25.640 --> 01:15:26.560
yeah

01:15:26.560 --> 01:15:31.120
i forgot to listen to it

01:15:31.120 --> 01:15:34.120
somebody else taking my chair

01:15:34.120 --> 01:15:37.120
look at this guy he's so stupid

01:15:37.120 --> 01:15:39.440
stupid guy

01:15:39.440 --> 01:15:40.480
what the hell

01:15:40.480 --> 01:15:42.200
what are you doing

01:15:42.200 --> 01:15:43.960
what am i like

01:15:43.960 --> 01:15:48.960
I feel like a lobster from Dick Tracy or something with his cord wrapping around me.

01:15:48.960 --> 01:15:53.960
He ain't going nowhere until you spill, spill.

01:15:53.960 --> 01:15:54.960
Oh.

01:15:54.960 --> 01:15:55.960
No, I think...

01:15:55.960 --> 01:15:56.960
Oh.

01:15:56.960 --> 01:15:57.960
Okay.

01:15:57.960 --> 01:15:58.960
Switching.

01:15:58.960 --> 01:15:59.960
Okay.

01:15:59.960 --> 01:16:00.960
You dropped it.

01:16:00.960 --> 01:16:06.960
Yeah, but you stepped on the cord when you threw it.

01:16:06.960 --> 01:16:07.960
Hi, cage match.

01:16:07.960 --> 01:16:08.960
Remember me?

01:16:08.960 --> 01:16:09.960
Oh, yeah.

01:16:09.960 --> 01:16:37.240
p0k3smot42o

01:16:37.240 --> 01:16:50.240
I'd like to mention that the Racebase R6 MK3 is the most gay racing chair I have ever seen.

01:16:50.240 --> 01:16:54.240
I can vouch for Loki, he does have ADHD.

01:16:54.240 --> 01:16:57.240
Hi, I'd like to finish Cage Mansion here, thank you.

01:16:57.240 --> 01:16:59.240
I haven't, it's you, but I've never took anything.

01:16:59.240 --> 01:17:00.240
Alright.

01:17:00.240 --> 01:17:01.240
That would explain it.

01:17:01.240 --> 01:17:02.240
Take this.

01:17:02.240 --> 01:17:05.240
My turn, my song's turn.

01:17:35.240 --> 01:17:42.240
with picking this. So here we go. This is my pick.

01:18:05.240 --> 01:18:19.680
Let me show you where I've been You and me, I'll be in the same

01:18:19.680 --> 01:18:34.680
Let me tell you where I've been You and me, you and I

01:18:34.680 --> 01:18:37.180
The ocean shines so bright

01:18:37.180 --> 01:18:39.180
It shines so bright

01:18:39.180 --> 01:18:41.180
I don't know what to say, I don't know what to say

01:20:11.180 --> 01:20:27.180
🎵

01:20:27.180 --> 01:20:29.180
🎵 Come into my dream 🎵

01:20:29.180 --> 01:20:47.540
Come into my dream Let me show you where I've been

01:20:47.540 --> 01:20:54.540
It's you and me I've seen Let me tell you what I mean

01:20:54.540 --> 01:20:57.540
In the deep blue skies

01:20:57.540 --> 01:21:01.540
There were rainbows in the night

01:21:01.540 --> 01:21:04.540
Here we need to fly

01:21:04.540 --> 01:21:08.540
And the ocean shines so bright

01:22:08.540 --> 01:22:16.540
Hello, that was Froggy with Comin' to My Dream, Jamie.

01:22:16.540 --> 01:22:22.540
It wasn't bad, but it sounded very, I guess, cookie-cutter, you know?

01:22:22.540 --> 01:22:28.540
The little pauses where it did the little vroom-vroom noise were kind of cool before it set up again,

01:22:28.540 --> 01:22:37.540
but it's not anything that I could really latch onto and concentrate on, so it gets to about a seven, yeah.

01:22:37.540 --> 01:22:48.540
I've heard that song so many times, not even funny.

01:22:48.540 --> 01:22:53.580
But it has Froggy in it, so I was expecting swimming music, and that's what it was.

01:22:53.580 --> 01:23:00.220
Music had me swimming into boredom.

01:23:00.220 --> 01:23:04.740
Now I was kind of tuning that one out too because I heard it so many times, but I was

01:23:04.740 --> 01:23:10.740
I was busy, you know, with renaming zip files and stuff.

01:23:10.740 --> 01:23:13.740
You and that massive porn book.

01:23:13.740 --> 01:23:17.740
Yeah, but this isn't about the porn collection. This is about Beatmania.

01:23:17.740 --> 01:23:20.740
No, it was okay. It was a pretty good song.

01:23:20.740 --> 01:23:28.740
In fact, I think it's better than my song this week, which you should vote out because I have a better one for next week.

01:23:28.740 --> 01:23:30.740
just vote for low-key sister

01:23:32.740 --> 01:23:34.740
chicken dance

01:23:35.740 --> 01:23:37.740
rule number one, can't vote for hollick

01:23:38.740 --> 01:23:44.740
you can however vote for pixie dust hot Kylie Minogue brand underpants if you want

01:23:44.740 --> 01:23:46.740
just a nice check that wasn't a music

01:23:46.740 --> 01:23:48.740
chat room joke, sorry

01:23:49.740 --> 01:23:55.740
it's a cool song, it's a little bit repetitive to me but aren't most songs like that repetitive

01:24:25.740 --> 01:24:48.740
kostjamrh I was listening to that song and I kind of liked it. It was slow in the beginning but I haven't heard many songs like it. But I thought I liked it. So I will have to say a 7.

01:24:48.740 --> 01:24:54.540
Alright, sounds good. Okay. Let's recap kids. Here you go. Send those votes now to sky

01:24:54.540 --> 01:24:57.900
Oh several more comment on that song. Okay, and then where's the lyrics?

01:25:00.300 --> 01:25:02.300
I'm so proud of you

01:25:05.780 --> 01:25:10.740
Some days I want to beat you over the head with that ferret repeatedly

01:25:10.740 --> 01:25:24.120
Let's recap, you can vote for one of these three songs.

01:25:24.120 --> 01:25:28.020
Song number one, two weeks running now, every little thing, cybertrance, face the change

01:25:58.020 --> 01:25:59.700
with coming to my dream

01:25:59.700 --> 01:26:02.200
jamie remember the lyrics to this one

01:26:12.500 --> 01:26:14.860
right now i feel like sandstorm

01:26:14.860 --> 01:26:17.460
did you do it

01:26:17.460 --> 01:26:18.820

01:26:23.540 --> 01:26:26.100
yeah this is

01:26:26.100 --> 01:26:27.600
Oh yeah, Bonzai got cancelled.

01:26:27.600 --> 01:26:28.600
Did Bonzai get cancelled?

01:26:28.600 --> 01:26:29.600
It had to have.

01:26:29.600 --> 01:26:30.600
It had to have.

01:26:30.600 --> 01:26:31.600
You know what?

01:26:31.600 --> 01:26:32.600
I don't care.

01:26:32.600 --> 01:26:35.600
That makes things better anyways.

01:26:35.600 --> 01:26:38.600
I'm sorry, puppy, nobody can hear you.

01:26:38.600 --> 01:26:40.600
Hey, is Takeshi's Castle still on?

01:26:40.600 --> 01:26:42.600
What was it, Most Extreme Challenge?

01:26:42.600 --> 01:26:45.600
Yes, Most Extreme Challenge is still on.

01:26:45.600 --> 01:26:50.600
I think I can find original episodes, though, of Takeshi's Castle.

01:26:50.600 --> 01:26:53.600
I want to see those.

01:26:53.600 --> 01:26:57.800
This is from some of the clips that they take out for the Hacked Up show.

01:26:57.800 --> 01:27:02.160
There must be some really incredibly stupid people on that show.

01:27:02.160 --> 01:27:10.680
My favorite clip is the one time that one chick took the soccer ball to the face.

01:27:10.680 --> 01:27:13.680
I like Japanese variety shows.

01:27:13.680 --> 01:27:15.880
I have a tape somewhere in my house.

01:27:15.880 --> 01:27:18.760
By the way, this is the first time I had ever seen any Dragon Ball Z.

01:27:18.760 --> 01:27:20.960
It was taped off of TV in Japan.

01:27:20.960 --> 01:27:23.000
I had Macross 7 on the tape.

01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:26.560
giving you an indication of how old this tape is, they had this show on a called...

01:27:26.560 --> 01:27:27.560
Actually, no, I didn't give you the indication.

01:27:27.560 --> 01:27:28.560
I don't remember what it was called.

01:27:28.560 --> 01:27:34.000
It was called like, Udi Nadi Land or something, but they had these interviews and stuff, and

01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:40.200
then they had dog soccer, where they tried to get the dog into the net by leading it

01:27:40.200 --> 01:27:45.120
with toys and things, and the dog got tired and took a shit on TV, and then they showed

01:27:45.120 --> 01:27:51.000
a repeat of it, and then they had sit, replay.

01:27:51.000 --> 01:28:06.160
I could totally make a Japanese TV, they just need to let me have no rules whatsoever, just

01:28:06.160 --> 01:28:07.160
let me do it.

01:28:07.160 --> 01:28:11.520
Calvin Ball the show, they need Calvin Ball the show.

01:28:11.520 --> 01:28:12.520
Calvin Ball the show.

01:28:12.520 --> 01:28:13.520
Calvin and Hobbes.

01:28:13.520 --> 01:28:15.520
There is no rules.

01:28:15.520 --> 01:28:19.560
They were trying to get a cow, so then they had a baby dressed up as a soccer ball.

01:28:19.560 --> 01:28:23.360
It was wearing this little black and white checked outfit with a little hat that looked

01:28:23.360 --> 01:28:24.360
like a soccer ball.

01:28:24.360 --> 01:28:25.360
Can I take it?

01:28:25.360 --> 01:28:26.360
And this baby's like...

01:28:26.360 --> 01:28:31.480
The thing is, is that this baby was so cute, because the baby would just sit there, and

01:28:31.480 --> 01:28:34.640
then people would wave something, and the baby would just laugh at him, and then go

01:28:34.640 --> 01:28:36.800
try to wander out of bounds.

01:28:36.800 --> 01:28:41.320
And then they were wiggling things, and the baby was going, ah, baby, and started calling

01:28:41.320 --> 01:28:42.320
across.

01:28:42.320 --> 01:28:43.320
It was pretty funny.

01:28:43.320 --> 01:28:44.320
I'll try to find my tape.

01:28:44.320 --> 01:28:49.280
And I've also got an interview with Jackie Chan on there, and then a made-for-TV movie

01:28:49.280 --> 01:28:52.780
with him on it, so it's cool. Jackie Chan rocks.

01:28:52.780 --> 01:28:59.060
And I have the best Godzilla movie ever because of the man with the CD player in his head.

01:28:59.060 --> 01:29:05.060
Godzilla vs. Mecha Ghidorah. Because the man had a CD player in his head.

01:29:05.060 --> 01:29:10.100
Wow. It's like, he's this android guy, and he's

01:29:10.100 --> 01:29:13.860
the only one who speaks English in the whole movie. It's great. Everything he says is in

01:29:13.860 --> 01:29:16.140
English. Of course, the freak with the CD player in

01:29:16.140 --> 01:29:28.700
in his head is the only one who speaks English. He wasn't Japanese, but I bet all the machinery

01:29:28.700 --> 01:29:36.380
in his head was. I bet it was Sony. It's like he pulls this thing out of his head and it's

01:29:36.380 --> 01:29:42.540
this storage device that pulls CDs in and out and everything. It's like an 18-CD changer

01:29:42.540 --> 01:29:48.900
in his head. It was really cool. He saw, I'm totally ignoring all this chaos.

01:29:48.900 --> 01:29:57.900
I'm listening to Yanni. I saw something else on TV, by the way. This

01:29:57.900 --> 01:29:59.340
was cool. You actually watched TV?

01:29:59.340 --> 01:30:05.100
I watched TV. I was at Julie's house yesterday, and we just happened to watch, what were we

01:30:05.100 --> 01:30:11.440
watching. We watched the Teen Titans on Cartoon Network. It was pretty funny because the intro

01:30:11.440 --> 01:30:20.200
song was done by Puffy. The J-pop group, the girl Puffy. I think she got sued by him for

01:30:20.200 --> 01:30:31.440
using the name. Fuck him. I know. There was some drama a while back, but the opening song

01:30:31.440 --> 01:30:34.360
was done by puffy and it was all in japanese it was cute

01:30:34.360 --> 01:30:36.560
you got a teen titans looks gay from the chat room

01:30:36.560 --> 01:30:42.200
it was funny it was very it was very happy and gay

01:30:42.200 --> 01:30:48.980
no the guy it's like it's done in the style of batman beyond but they do like cutesy manga

01:30:48.980 --> 01:30:52.200
things like like beast boy was doing sweat drops and everything it was cute

01:30:52.200 --> 01:30:57.300
it was really funny don't everybody talk at once

01:30:57.300 --> 01:31:01.420
you guys want to hear who won the cage match no okay okay then we'll go to a break i guess

01:31:01.420 --> 01:31:07.100
the winner tonight, and I thought we were going to have a tie, but we got one vote in

01:31:07.100 --> 01:31:14.100
at the last minute that broke the tie. So tonight's winner, it was a low voting night,

01:31:14.100 --> 01:31:20.500
you guys pissed me off, that's right. Tonight's winner, surprisingly enough, is Broggy with

01:31:20.500 --> 01:31:28.940
Coming to My Dream. Jamie, you were that close, your song just

01:31:28.940 --> 01:31:34.540
had one vote shy and low-key, you only got one vote, so people are sick of that song

01:31:34.540 --> 01:31:35.540
finally.

01:31:35.540 --> 01:31:39.780
Yeah, they got tired of still my words because it's a more Ghost 10th Planet mix.

01:31:39.780 --> 01:31:43.500
And an honorable mention to Hollick.

01:31:43.500 --> 01:31:45.780
Do you mean that Pixie Dust Underwear didn't get any votes?

01:31:45.780 --> 01:31:47.300
Pixie Dust Underwear did not get any votes.

01:31:47.300 --> 01:31:49.740
Oh my God, that's a sin.

01:31:49.740 --> 01:31:53.160
I vote for you.

01:31:53.160 --> 01:31:57.820
I didn't have any voting privileges, so I couldn't vote for the underwear.

01:31:57.820 --> 01:32:02.460
I think we collectively as a non-voting group, because we're all here and only people in

01:32:02.460 --> 01:32:08.580
the chat room can vote, we'll all collectively vote for Pixie Dust in her drawers.

01:32:08.580 --> 01:32:09.580
All of us except you.

01:32:09.580 --> 01:32:10.580
I vote for the ferret.

01:32:10.580 --> 01:32:11.580
Let's go to break.

01:32:11.580 --> 01:32:12.580
Sounds like a good idea.

01:32:12.580 --> 01:32:13.580
Nope, we're happy.

01:32:13.580 --> 01:32:20.580
it

01:32:20.820 --> 01:32:23.740
we would tell you let's go to break

01:32:23.740 --> 01:32:26.260
they're like a good idea

01:32:26.260 --> 01:32:30.540
the

01:32:30.540 --> 01:32:33.260
all right

01:32:33.260 --> 01:32:35.380

01:33:12.180 --> 01:33:14.180
Oh God, I don't even know if I can find one of that feeling.

01:33:14.180 --> 01:33:15.180
I'll see if I can...

01:33:15.180 --> 01:33:16.180
Okay.

Stay tuned.

01:33:33.540 --> 01:33:34.540
You're listening to Orange Launch Radio.

01:33:34.540 --> 01:33:52.540
We are what we're supposed to be, illusions of a fantasy

01:33:52.540 --> 01:33:55.540
All that I'd like to speak or say

01:33:55.540 --> 01:33:58.540
What you do is what you wish to do

01:33:58.540 --> 01:34:01.040
We are the god of symphony

01:34:01.040 --> 01:34:03.540
We do the things you want to see

01:34:03.540 --> 01:34:06.540
Brain by brain to do the extreme

01:34:06.540 --> 01:34:09.540
Our friends are so unreasonable

01:34:09.540 --> 01:34:12.540
They do the unpredictable

01:34:12.540 --> 01:34:14.540
I'd also like to speak and say

01:34:14.540 --> 01:34:17.540
What we do is what you wish to do

01:34:17.540 --> 01:34:20.540
There's no time nor fish for a friend

01:34:20.540 --> 01:34:22.540
Do it on the little bay

01:34:22.540 --> 01:34:25.540
Brain by brain to do the extreme

01:34:25.540 --> 01:34:28.540
We're just one by one, we're making it one

01:34:28.540 --> 01:34:31.540
We are the stars, we're heroes of the world

01:34:31.540 --> 01:34:34.540
We are the ones who are never over

01:34:34.540 --> 01:34:36.540
We're singing by your back, raising minds

01:34:36.540 --> 01:34:39.540
For the ones that are gonna be forever

01:34:39.540 --> 01:34:42.540
Get your body back, and rock it for the end

01:34:42.540 --> 01:34:45.540
We're gonna dream about a true star for it

01:34:45.540 --> 01:34:48.540
We're gonna superman, and never, never, never

01:34:48.540 --> 01:34:51.180
We're one, two, three, two, three, four!

01:35:18.540 --> 01:35:46.540
I feel, I feel

01:35:46.540 --> 01:35:53.540
I can feel it. You are the only one. Let me feel this way.

01:36:04.540 --> 01:36:11.540
I can feel it. I can feel it. I can feel it.

01:36:11.540 --> 01:36:25.540
When I come down, I come down right to the sun

01:36:25.540 --> 01:36:28.040
Hands right down, then right down the bed

01:36:28.040 --> 01:36:30.540
Round and round, scoot right close to the air

01:36:30.540 --> 01:36:34.540
Took just a sec, that's what it's like to come down again

01:36:34.540 --> 01:36:38.040
Keep an edge, nevertheless I'll be fresh to the bed

01:36:38.040 --> 01:36:40.540
Get to the feeling

01:36:40.540 --> 01:36:43.040
I'm taking the pose until nobody knows

01:36:43.040 --> 01:36:45.540
When I'm on my way to get down to the head

01:36:45.540 --> 01:36:47.540
Down, down

01:36:47.540 --> 01:36:51.040
Hands right down the bed

01:36:51.040 --> 01:36:53.040
Just one, two, three, four

01:36:53.040 --> 01:36:55.540
Come on y'all, I've been on before

01:36:55.540 --> 01:36:58.040
Can't write down, can't write down a shit

01:36:58.040 --> 01:37:00.540
I'm rounding out, super close finger

01:37:00.540 --> 01:37:03.040
Come down, check, speed for net

01:37:03.040 --> 01:37:05.040
Get to the fever

01:37:05.040 --> 01:37:08.540
I'm keeping the floor, I'm getting right down to the dirt

01:37:08.540 --> 01:37:10.540
In the dark, I'm kicking to the floor

01:37:10.540 --> 01:37:13.540
Come down, check, speed for net

01:37:13.540 --> 01:37:15.540
Nothing but this, I'm a friend to the best

01:39:15.540 --> 01:39:19.540
The

01:39:19.540 --> 01:39:23.540
The

01:39:23.540 --> 01:39:27.540
The

01:39:27.540 --> 01:39:31.540
The

01:39:31.540 --> 01:39:35.540
The

01:39:35.540 --> 01:39:39.540
The

01:39:39.540 --> 01:39:43.540
The

01:39:43.540 --> 01:40:12.540
We're back, and we're here, and Rob's running around on fire, because he's so hot.

01:40:12.540 --> 01:40:22.280
or be attacked by a giant metallic man ah yeah you know what I'm thinking that

01:40:22.280 --> 01:40:26.280
because the chat room has demanded it we should bring back one of our favorite

01:40:26.280 --> 01:40:31.080
segments match game but not immediately because someone has to write up the

01:40:31.080 --> 01:40:36.000
things for my team so we need to do the FUs of the week that is a very important

01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:43.000
thing

01:40:43.480 --> 01:40:44.900
you know why don't you

01:40:44.900 --> 01:40:48.560

01:40:49.920 --> 01:40:51.480
or am I supposed to be interviewing?

01:40:51.480 --> 01:40:52.840

01:40:55.080 --> 01:40:57.240

01:40:57.240 --> 01:41:00.240
let him count the money and you come over here

01:41:00.240 --> 01:41:01.720
take that mic

01:41:01.720 --> 01:41:04.920
do you need me to write match game or do you want to do it?

01:41:04.920 --> 01:41:09.920
Where is this cord going? It's going under Loki's chair.

01:41:09.920 --> 01:41:14.920
Stop moving your chair around. It's rolling over the cable.

01:41:14.920 --> 01:41:19.920
Stop moving the microphone. You know what?

01:41:19.920 --> 01:41:24.920
I'm going to walk circles around Loki while I do this.

01:41:24.920 --> 01:41:29.920
So, Puppy had a summer job. Where was his summer job at?

01:41:29.920 --> 01:41:36.680
I understand that last month you had a very interesting experience while you were working

01:41:36.680 --> 01:41:38.680
there than at the night shift.

01:41:38.680 --> 01:41:39.680
Yes.

01:41:39.680 --> 01:41:43.120
A little thing that's called armed takeover robbery.

01:41:43.120 --> 01:41:45.760
I know, it's sweet.

01:41:45.760 --> 01:41:49.160
You know what I think is so great about this is that Puppy has such a great sense of humor

01:41:49.160 --> 01:41:52.320
about getting robbed at gunpoint.

01:41:52.320 --> 01:41:54.320
I know, it's kind of funny.

01:41:54.320 --> 01:41:55.760
So what happened?

01:41:55.760 --> 01:41:56.760
What happened?

01:41:56.760 --> 01:42:02.960
It was Sunday night, we closed at 11, but there was this last group of people out on

01:42:02.960 --> 01:42:08.160
the golf courses that was taking fucking forever, because they were trying to like, jump on

01:42:08.160 --> 01:42:12.920
each other and beat each other up while they were golfing, so they left about 11.30, and

01:42:12.920 --> 01:42:17.240
then we closed up the arcade, the other employee that was there left, so it was just me and

01:42:17.240 --> 01:42:18.860
the assistant manager there.

01:42:18.860 --> 01:42:26.720
I went out to clean the bathrooms about 11.40, and then apparently some black truck came

01:42:26.720 --> 01:42:40.240
2 guys come in behind me and I'm like, YOU SHOOT THE FUCK UP RIGHT NOW!

01:42:40.240 --> 01:42:46.240
They were like, okay, whatever. And they both have their guns, they're just kind of nonchalant.

01:42:46.240 --> 01:42:50.240
Were you high off the cleaning fumes? Was that what it is?

01:42:50.240 --> 01:42:56.240
No, it's not that kind of cleaning fumes. It's not those kind of cleaning fluids. I kind of wish it was, though.

01:42:56.240 --> 01:43:05.240
They basically were just like, yeah, we don't want to hurt nobody. Where's the fucking money at? How do we get in? Who else is in there? Typical shit.

01:43:05.240 --> 01:43:14.200
It was funny because the whole time I was just like, not even, I was pretty much ignoring

01:43:14.200 --> 01:43:20.920
the fact that they had guns, because all three of them, they had, let's see, after the first

01:43:20.920 --> 01:43:21.920
two guys came in...

01:43:21.920 --> 01:43:22.920
Were they real guns?

01:43:22.920 --> 01:43:26.440
They probably were real guns, but chances are they weren't even loaded.

01:43:26.440 --> 01:43:31.680
And it was kind of funny because as I was sitting there standing there while the two

01:43:31.680 --> 01:43:34.960
guys with the guns were asking me questions, I saw the third guy come up around the corner

01:43:34.960 --> 01:43:41.960
the building. He comes running around like he's a fucking 007 or something.

01:43:41.960 --> 01:43:46.480
Like he was a Qsar. Yeah, like running around the corner looking

01:43:46.480 --> 01:43:51.680
around like they're trying to see if there's anybody around. Like he's trying to run in

01:43:51.680 --> 01:43:58.080
and tackle somebody. So what happened? They rounded you all up.

01:43:58.080 --> 01:44:04.220
They got me and the assistant manager. They took me around the back through the workroom

01:44:04.220 --> 01:44:09.220
in the back into the manager's office where the assistant manager's in there counting

01:44:09.220 --> 01:44:16.500
money or actually he had just finished counting up all the money for the night and he had

01:44:16.500 --> 01:44:22.460
a bag of money that was sealed up to drop off at the bank so they had us both on the

01:44:22.460 --> 01:44:27.700
floor and they duct taped our hands behind our backs and then dug through and made a

01:44:27.700 --> 01:44:35.220
fucking mess out of everything. And then they took the money, and they took a bucket of

01:44:35.220 --> 01:44:38.420
change that the assistant manager usually keeps with them to take to buy options.

01:44:38.420 --> 01:44:43.140
Well, draw plan tokens. Actually, no. Surprisingly, they didn't take tokens, which was kind of

01:44:43.140 --> 01:44:49.940
funny. What would you do if you stole tokens? That's so sad. I know. It'd be kind of funny

01:44:49.940 --> 01:44:54.400
to see them all take tokens. Are you that hard up for DDR that you have to steal tokens

01:44:54.400 --> 01:44:55.400
a gunpoint.

01:44:55.400 --> 01:44:56.400
Well, they were black.

01:44:56.400 --> 01:44:57.400
I don't think they played DDR.

01:44:57.400 --> 01:44:58.400
I know some...

01:44:58.400 --> 01:44:59.400
There were black teenagers with guns.

01:44:59.400 --> 01:45:00.400
What the hell do you think?

01:45:00.400 --> 01:45:01.400
Well, he didn't have a gun, and he wasn't a teenager.

01:45:01.400 --> 01:45:02.400
Anyway...

01:45:02.400 --> 01:45:03.400
Well, I don't know what you would do with it, Lenny.

01:45:03.400 --> 01:45:17.400
If I was a black teenager with a gun, I'd be playing DDR whenever I want.

01:45:17.400 --> 01:45:20.960
There wouldn't be no fucking line.

01:45:20.960 --> 01:45:21.960
Not with a gun, anyway.

01:45:21.960 --> 01:45:27.360
So they took his bucket of change and he had sets of keys in there. They threw out two

01:45:27.360 --> 01:45:33.320
of his three sets of keys. One of the keys was actually the set of keys to all the doors

01:45:33.320 --> 01:45:38.600
and all the games and stuff inside the arcade. They didn't take those. They accidentally

01:45:38.600 --> 01:45:48.080
took his car keys. Now he can't get into his car and he has to walk home. By the time this

01:45:48.080 --> 01:45:51.580
whole ordeal was done with the cops getting there and everything. It was like almost two

01:45:51.580 --> 01:45:52.580
in the morning.

01:45:52.580 --> 01:45:55.580
They made off with about $4,700.

01:45:55.580 --> 01:45:56.580
That's it?

01:45:56.580 --> 01:46:06.220
I don't seem like that much. That's all the golf I make? Shit.

01:46:06.220 --> 01:46:20.820
It's Castro Valley, we're not fucking Milpitas or Roseville, can you imagine how much money

01:46:20.820 --> 01:46:22.380
that place was making today?

01:46:22.380 --> 01:46:24.260
But they have a security job.

01:46:24.260 --> 01:46:33.540
Not that we would advocate robbing, maybe vandalism, no, we're not advocating those

01:46:33.540 --> 01:46:38.820
Those things were a good, polite show, but if you want to trip some little kids while

01:46:38.820 --> 01:46:42.740
you're there, feel free.

01:46:42.740 --> 01:46:45.300
Just don't damage their property, because we don't advocate that, because we don't want

01:46:45.300 --> 01:46:46.300
to get sued.

01:46:46.300 --> 01:46:49.700
Trip a little kids all you want, though.

01:46:49.700 --> 01:46:53.740
And then tell the kids to have their parents sue Golf Land.

01:46:53.740 --> 01:47:00.180
Okay, so the funny part was, as they left, they called the cops.

01:47:30.180 --> 01:47:33.940
If they were to actually try, if they would have undone that, and there was just one of

01:47:33.940 --> 01:47:37.780
them in the room, I would have probably kicked the people, the really crap out of him.

01:47:37.780 --> 01:47:43.260
Because, I mean, I could defend myself against one person, but not three, and it was.

01:47:43.260 --> 01:47:46.540
And then there would have been, if also the gun that he had would have been loaded, then

01:47:46.540 --> 01:47:47.780
I could, you know, just use that.

01:47:47.780 --> 01:47:48.780
Okay.

01:47:48.780 --> 01:47:52.820
And then that's the whole dream sequence thing.

01:47:52.820 --> 01:47:59.420
Enter dream sequence, and I killed all the two guys, and I'm the hero, and yeah.

01:47:59.420 --> 01:48:03.420
Lokey called him a loser.

01:48:03.420 --> 01:48:05.420
I don't blame him.

01:48:05.420 --> 01:48:09.420
So did you get anything from, um, Castro Valley Golf Club from getting robbed?

01:48:09.420 --> 01:48:11.420
Was it like, you know, did you get at least a card?

01:48:11.420 --> 01:48:13.420
You know, sorry to hear you were robbed at gunpoint.

01:48:13.420 --> 01:48:15.420
Yeah, here's, no.

01:48:15.420 --> 01:48:18.420
Why don't you take tomorrow off? Did you get anything like that?

01:48:18.420 --> 01:48:22.420
I took, I intentionally took the next day off.

01:48:22.420 --> 01:48:26.420
But then again, did you call in and emotionally scarred to work?

01:48:26.420 --> 01:48:27.420
No, I would have.

01:48:27.420 --> 01:48:33.120
Well actually it was more like I needed to go out of the DMV because the fuckers took

01:48:33.120 --> 01:48:34.120
our driver's license.

01:48:34.120 --> 01:48:39.880
They took out both of our wallets, go through them, and take out just the driver's license.

01:48:39.880 --> 01:48:43.600
No cash, no credit cards, no anything else.

01:48:43.600 --> 01:48:44.960
Just our driver's licenses.

01:48:44.960 --> 01:48:50.200
I mean, because that would have done them a lot of good to have your driver's license

01:48:50.200 --> 01:48:52.520
because you look just like a black teenager and all.

01:48:52.520 --> 01:48:53.520
Yeah, I know.

01:48:53.520 --> 01:49:09.960
I ended up spending three hours at the DMV the next day to get my new driver's license

01:49:09.960 --> 01:49:16.020
and out of all of it I got a new picture of my driver's license and now my picture looks

01:49:16.020 --> 01:49:20.760
much better and more like me instead of me at 10 a.m.

01:49:50.760 --> 01:50:11.760
Yeah, and you know what pisses me off about this emulator? Is that, um, no, here's what the thing is. It's like, okay, I've got the hard drive image for the Japanese version of Complete Mix 2, yet I have the ROM for the US version of Complete Mix 2, and they don't work together.

01:50:11.760 --> 01:50:12.760
Ooh, that's not good.

01:50:12.760 --> 01:50:17.760
No, they do for, um, it's weird because they do for Complete Mix 1, but I don't know why it's not working for Complete Mix 2.

01:50:17.760 --> 01:50:29.760
hip hop mania is the same thing is this a different rom same hard drive image

01:50:47.760 --> 01:50:52.760
So, let's, um, we're gonna go to a break and then come back and do the FUs.

01:50:52.760 --> 01:50:55.760
Let's do, okay, let's do the FUs now.

01:50:55.760 --> 01:50:57.760
The chat room can submit them while we're doing ours.

01:50:57.760 --> 01:51:02.760
Oh wait, no, she's gonna put the music up herself, okay.

01:51:02.760 --> 01:51:07.760
No, it's just gonna take a second here.

01:51:07.760 --> 01:51:11.760
So, if you want to submit an FU of the Week chat room, just send those over a private message to me right now.

01:51:11.760 --> 01:51:15.760
You can send those in while we're doing ours.

01:51:15.760 --> 01:51:20.760
Usually I give you guys a break, but people don't start sending them in anyway until they hear us doing ours.

01:51:20.760 --> 01:51:25.760
So, I don't think it does it all good anyway, so forget it.

01:51:25.760 --> 01:51:29.760
So, Jamie, what happens during the FUs of the Week?

01:51:29.760 --> 01:51:31.760
It's when we bitch about stuff.

01:51:31.760 --> 01:51:33.760
Well, here we go.

01:51:33.760 --> 01:51:54.480
My first nephew of the week goes toward mixed auto sales in Roseville, and they're out of

01:51:54.480 --> 01:51:56.320
business now the bitches.

01:51:56.320 --> 01:51:58.040
I bought my car from them.

01:51:58.040 --> 01:52:02.240
My car had a low idle, but he assured me, you know, it's fine, we can fix it.

01:52:02.240 --> 01:52:04.240
Now my engine is dead!

01:52:04.240 --> 01:52:08.240
Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, fuck you!

01:52:08.240 --> 01:52:10.240
I love my car, and now it's shit.

01:52:10.240 --> 01:52:12.240
Fuck him a whole lot.

01:52:12.240 --> 01:52:17.240
And I can't even begin to say how mad I am over this.

01:52:17.240 --> 01:52:20.240
Who all has been in my car with me?

01:52:20.240 --> 01:52:23.240
Who all knows how much I love my car?

01:52:23.240 --> 01:52:27.240
Okay, I love my car, and now it's shit.

01:52:27.240 --> 01:52:30.240
So, I hope he eats shit.

01:52:30.240 --> 01:52:34.240
and then, and then poops it, and then has it

01:52:34.240 --> 01:52:36.240
Well, he's obviously bankrupt

01:52:36.240 --> 01:52:42.240
No, I want, I want him to eat shit, poop it, and then have it fed intravenously to him

01:52:44.240 --> 01:52:46.240
Wow

01:52:46.240 --> 01:52:48.240
Wow

01:52:48.240 --> 01:52:54.240
And then, and then, I want all of the, the shit blood drained from him

01:52:54.240 --> 01:52:59.240
and then given to him as a suppository

01:52:59.240 --> 01:53:03.240
I want him to have a bloodshed enema, because I'm so mad.

01:53:03.240 --> 01:53:06.240
This is such a tasteful show this evening, I'm so excited.

01:53:06.240 --> 01:53:08.240
I am so pissed, no, no.

01:53:08.240 --> 01:53:10.240
I don't even get started when I'm really pissed off.

01:53:10.240 --> 01:53:13.240
When I am really, really, really pissed off,

01:53:13.240 --> 01:53:16.240
I think of the most foul and horrible things that will happen to people,

01:53:16.240 --> 01:53:18.240
and then imagine them.

01:53:18.240 --> 01:53:22.240
So this is me at work Friday, thinking of all kinds of foul,

01:53:22.240 --> 01:53:26.240
and I've had days to think of how I want this man to die.

01:53:26.240 --> 01:53:33.240
I could come up with so many good tortures, but the thing is, is that just killing him wouldn't be enough.

01:53:33.240 --> 01:53:36.240
Because when you're dead, you can't hurt a dead person anymore.

01:53:36.240 --> 01:53:40.240
Unless you pull their soul from the bowels of hell.

01:53:40.240 --> 01:53:48.240
But usually the bowels of hell are even worse than what any single person alive could imagine.

01:53:48.240 --> 01:53:54.440
Just have a defibrillator handy so that when he actually dies, like you wait five minutes

01:53:54.440 --> 01:53:57.800
then bring him back to life and kill him again.

01:53:57.800 --> 01:54:00.160
And you can't do that much damage to somebody though.

01:54:00.160 --> 01:54:04.080
And you'd have to like freeze them to death and then warm up and you know thaw them out

01:54:04.080 --> 01:54:05.640
like a TV did or, ooh microwave.

01:54:05.640 --> 01:54:09.320
But you know you could like stick his hand in the microwave and then trigger it to where

01:54:09.320 --> 01:54:10.320
his hand would explode.

01:54:10.320 --> 01:54:11.320
You'd live through that.

01:54:11.320 --> 01:54:15.160
You'd have a little bit of radiation poisoning but you'd live.

01:54:15.160 --> 01:54:23.560
know I'm mad I'm mad I'm very mad I'm mad that my antibiotics have done

01:54:23.560 --> 01:54:28.100
nothing that make me sick all week but I took the last one today so I'm

01:54:28.100 --> 01:54:33.520
officially healthy but I still have to take all the other crap and my nose is still

01:54:33.520 --> 01:54:37.000
running so I didn't do crap for that

01:54:38.520 --> 01:54:44.960
and then and yes I love my car I said I love my car I deal with it I love my

01:54:44.960 --> 01:54:52.040
car. And then, fuck Nissan. Because I asked them if they would order me a Skyline and

01:54:52.040 --> 01:55:00.520
they said no. I want one. They said no. They won't. The dealerships will not actually import

01:55:00.520 --> 01:55:05.240
the cars. You have to go buy them yourself and ship it yourself. Which is fine because

01:55:05.240 --> 01:55:10.960
I know a place I can get one for $60,000. If I had $60,000 more, I'd go to my bank.

01:55:10.960 --> 01:55:12.480
Hey, give me $60,000.

01:55:12.480 --> 01:55:14.320
I need to order me a car.

01:55:14.320 --> 01:55:18.200
I'm going to be like, uh, no.

01:55:18.200 --> 01:55:19.520
Sure, you can have it.

01:55:19.520 --> 01:55:23.360
But here's a 20% interest rate while we

01:55:23.360 --> 01:55:25.440
steal your firstborn, your liver, and your kidneys

01:55:25.440 --> 01:55:27.680
and sell them in New Orleans on the market.

01:55:31.600 --> 01:55:34.160
Well, yeah, it'd be great.

01:55:34.160 --> 01:55:35.840
I'll say, you can have my firstborn,

01:55:35.840 --> 01:55:37.240
and then I just won't breathe.

01:55:37.240 --> 01:55:37.840
So I'm cool.

01:55:37.840 --> 01:55:40.800
I'll speak our hate.

01:55:40.800 --> 01:55:46.560
And then, you know, if I have my computer, it does this weird thing, and I don't know why,

01:55:47.160 --> 01:55:54.500
where it will not save my image files as a JPEG or a GIF as they're uploaded on their site's house.

01:55:54.840 --> 01:55:58.660
It will save it as a bitmap, un-titled bitmap, so I have to title everything.

01:55:58.660 --> 01:56:02.000
And then I have to go through and get, I have tons of bitmaps on my computer now,

01:56:02.000 --> 01:56:04.120
so it's taking up more space than it needs to, but then again I have

01:56:04.120 --> 01:56:05.440
that 120 gig hard drive, so I'm fine.

01:56:05.440 --> 01:56:15.440
And then, and then, you know, there's just really not a lot else.

01:56:15.440 --> 01:56:17.080
I can't really think of anything else.

01:56:17.080 --> 01:56:20.160
It's really my car and my car makes me cry.

01:56:20.160 --> 01:56:28.040
And oh yeah, a big, big F-you to Phantasy Star Online for freezing when I was going

01:56:28.040 --> 01:56:29.040
into the ruins.

01:56:29.040 --> 01:56:33.320
And they were just like, okay, we've gone to TGI Fridays and left our games on idle

01:56:33.320 --> 01:56:36.760
And I had the cord holding down my analog button on the menu

01:56:36.760 --> 01:56:39.960
so they would keep scrolling through the menu and would log me off.

01:56:39.960 --> 01:56:43.280
I'm smart, see? Xbox.

01:56:43.280 --> 01:56:45.760
I have the GameCube on too.

01:56:45.760 --> 01:56:50.120
Entering that. No.

01:56:50.120 --> 01:56:53.560
You can't do GameCube to Xbox. It does.

01:56:53.560 --> 01:56:54.560
That's a waste of money.

01:56:54.560 --> 01:56:57.240
If I remember right, they have

01:56:57.240 --> 01:57:00.880
different classes. GameCube has a class, a separate class of its own.

01:57:00.880 --> 01:57:02.720
Xbox has a separate class of its own.

01:57:02.720 --> 01:57:03.720
I have the same one.

01:57:03.720 --> 01:57:04.720
Oh.

01:57:04.720 --> 01:57:05.720
Well, then it sucks.

01:57:05.720 --> 01:57:07.720
The Xbox one has more outfits.

01:57:07.720 --> 01:57:08.720
Oh.

01:57:08.720 --> 01:57:15.040
But at any rate, I came back and Julie got logged off.

01:57:15.040 --> 01:57:16.040
I stayed on.

01:57:16.040 --> 01:57:17.880
So our room was intact.

01:57:17.880 --> 01:57:19.960
And then so she logs on and everything.

01:57:19.960 --> 01:57:22.760
And then as we're going down to the planet, my game freezes.

01:57:22.760 --> 01:57:28.880
And I can't catch all my equipped items, including my Devil Wing Mags and all my Alrappies and

01:57:28.880 --> 01:57:37.200
my God battle and my cross guards and everything, but I lost my flight plan and I lost all of

01:57:37.200 --> 01:57:41.680
my crap items. The thing is that I have max money, so it was kind of cool. It was just

01:57:41.680 --> 01:57:48.080
aggravating having to go get all that stuff. I went up five levels that night. It was great.

01:57:48.080 --> 01:57:54.040
Six levels. I went up six levels. Then we did Endless Nightmare and that was cool.

01:57:54.040 --> 01:58:15.120
I have to give an F.U. to Pepsi for making a vanilla Pepsi that tastes so damn good because

01:58:15.120 --> 01:58:16.680
I hate Pepsi.

01:58:16.680 --> 01:58:18.360
Vanilla Pepsi is the best.

01:58:18.360 --> 01:58:20.880
What did I say when vanilla Coke came out?

01:58:20.880 --> 01:58:22.400
I said, can't wait for vanilla Pepsi.

01:58:22.400 --> 01:58:23.400
Here it is.

01:58:23.400 --> 01:58:31.080
that same cokey aftertaste so and another at you goes toward my lifestyle

01:58:31.080 --> 01:58:37.600
adjustment because on the outside it looks successful but not when I stepped

01:58:37.600 --> 01:58:42.240
on the scale so I'm using my gym membership now and fuck everybody who

01:58:42.240 --> 01:58:45.640
will go to the gym with me I hate you

01:58:46.360 --> 01:58:50.280
okay I don't hate you I was kidding I know but I hate the guy who's holding my

01:58:50.280 --> 01:59:00.840
car. I don't want him dead. I need a basement. Oh my god, I need a basement. If I had a basement,

01:59:00.840 --> 01:59:04.840
I could still set up the perfect torture chamber there. I can see Jamie there right now. It

01:59:04.840 --> 01:59:18.880
puts the lotion on its skin and puts it in the basket. And, oh yeah, fuck CD Japan for

01:59:18.880 --> 01:59:25.000
making the pre-order for battle royale 2, 80 bucks, what? You should see how much it

01:59:25.000 --> 01:59:31.520
is on yesasia.com. Fuck that shit. I'm just going to see if anime jungle Osaka can order

01:59:31.520 --> 01:59:37.680
it for me, because I'll at least get it for 60 there. Because Jamie actually collects

01:59:37.680 --> 01:59:42.600
the real thing. I buy the real thing so I can watch it on my big TV with my DVD player

01:59:42.600 --> 01:59:50.600
over and over and over again, and then I can copy the DVDs for my friends and get a nice transfer.

01:59:50.600 --> 01:59:51.600
What an angel.

01:59:51.600 --> 01:59:52.600
Okay, next.

01:59:52.600 --> 01:59:54.600
Loki, your turn.

01:59:54.600 --> 01:59:59.600
Mario Golf?

01:59:59.600 --> 02:00:02.600
Mario Golf is cool!

02:00:02.600 --> 02:00:03.600
Shut up, loser.

02:00:03.600 --> 02:00:09.600
Anyways, first I'm going to start off with a big F2 speedy oil change because you suck,

02:00:09.600 --> 02:00:21.600
The fact that you made me wait four hours to get my tune-up the first time, then I come to find out you ripped me off on the tune-up, then you break my car, speedy oil change.

02:00:21.600 --> 02:00:24.600
They suck, so you know, a few of them.

02:00:24.600 --> 02:00:28.600
I should have gotten a clue when I saw a bunch of teenagers working there.

02:00:28.600 --> 02:00:31.600
Teenagers can't fix anything. They suck.

02:00:31.600 --> 02:00:35.600
It's like auto-shop. That's what it was. It was just auto-shop.

02:00:35.600 --> 02:00:39.600
They have taken my car to auto-shop and having them fix it.

02:00:39.600 --> 02:00:42.600
Well, we replaced your engine for you.

02:00:42.600 --> 02:00:44.600
I just wanted a tune-up.

02:00:47.600 --> 02:00:50.600
I thought you wanted us to put a lawnmower engine in there.

02:00:50.600 --> 02:00:57.600
kostjamrh Why do I hear Ultimate Cheeseburger?

02:01:20.600 --> 02:01:21.600
That's unacceptable.

02:01:21.600 --> 02:01:22.600
Oh, bloop!

02:01:22.600 --> 02:01:27.600
F you too, stupid people who can't drive.

02:01:27.600 --> 02:01:32.600
And normally those people that turn out in front of me and then go slow.

02:01:32.600 --> 02:01:33.600
Oh, and another thing.

02:01:33.600 --> 02:01:39.600
If you're driving a ricer, you should not be going slower than I am, okay?

02:01:39.600 --> 02:01:43.600
You're in a souped up car, supposedly.

02:01:43.600 --> 02:01:52.600
Remember, the typical rice car, rice mobile now, has like, you know, a stupid four banger in it, and a hole in the muffler to sound hot.

02:01:52.600 --> 02:01:54.600
And then just like, just a plastic box.

02:01:54.600 --> 02:01:57.600
Yeah, but they had already just did all the, like, body modifications to it.

02:01:57.600 --> 02:02:01.600
Haven't quite painted it yet, but they've done all the body modifications for it.

02:02:01.600 --> 02:02:04.600
And, um, they were going really slow, in the slow lane.

02:02:04.600 --> 02:02:08.600
And I was trying to pass them, because I was trying to, you know, go home.

02:02:08.600 --> 02:02:12.600
Have you ever tried doing that to somebody? It's a blast.

02:02:12.600 --> 02:02:14.600
i hate, i hate that

02:02:42.600 --> 02:02:48.600
After the radio check, because you suck, I bought S-Video cables to hook up the TV today.

02:02:48.600 --> 02:02:51.600
First off, they don't sell anything larger than 12 feet for S-Video.

02:02:51.600 --> 02:03:00.600
Sure, they have 100-foot regular AV cables, but no, we don't have S-Video cables that are larger than 12 feet.

02:03:00.600 --> 02:03:07.600
So I had to buy two S-Video cables and a connector for the two of them.

02:03:07.600 --> 02:03:10.600
That cost $45.

02:03:10.600 --> 02:03:12.600
Holy crap!

02:03:40.600 --> 02:03:53.960
My turn. F you to people that aren't willing to drive 10 miles over the speed limit on

02:03:53.960 --> 02:03:57.920
windy roads because that's what they're built for is going fast. Word.

02:03:57.920 --> 02:04:05.520
An F you as well to the fact that it's easy to climb up a rock. You handed the mic to

02:04:05.520 --> 02:04:22.520
If you did the fact that it's easy to climb up a rock, but it's not easy to get down, jumping is not an option.

02:04:22.520 --> 02:04:27.400
You know wasting all that time and energy humping the rock. You know that I did not have the rock

02:04:28.120 --> 02:04:33.320
As you did that lady who made us while a stand guard while she took a pee behind the rock

02:04:37.720 --> 02:04:43.080
I almost did I had to have a picture of her somewhere and then when you see what this woman looks like you'll understand

02:04:43.080 --> 02:04:45.080
Why I did not want to get a picture of her pain

02:04:45.920 --> 02:04:48.000
Behind the rock oh my god

02:04:48.000 --> 02:04:55.000
the

02:04:56.860 --> 02:05:00.860
the

02:05:00.860 --> 02:05:05.440
kids run over

02:05:05.440 --> 02:05:10.200
and that you also to uh... the back of the arcade stars because that the your

02:05:10.200 --> 02:05:11.680
machine

02:05:11.680 --> 02:05:15.000
dot this is why should not be getting this is an i could have been able to go

02:05:45.000 --> 02:05:48.800
And I might add, the DDR is broken.

02:05:48.800 --> 02:05:51.160
All of them.

02:05:51.160 --> 02:05:54.280
Yeah, but all the arrows, like, suck on DDR now,

02:05:54.280 --> 02:05:56.240
so I can't play doubles or anything.

02:05:56.240 --> 02:05:58.320
But, like, the shooting gallery, so you're playing 2DX,

02:05:58.320 --> 02:06:01.160
you know, it's all, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da.

02:06:01.160 --> 02:06:02.280
What's that noise?

02:06:02.280 --> 02:06:03.840
Oh, that was someone shooting at us.

02:06:03.840 --> 02:06:07.120
Oh, you shot me.

02:06:07.120 --> 02:06:08.480
That's the shooting range.

02:06:08.480 --> 02:06:10.520
Like, all of a sudden, I'm playing sync, right?

02:06:10.520 --> 02:06:12.200
I have a 200-something combo going.

02:06:12.200 --> 02:06:15.200
And then all of a sudden, oh, you shot me!

02:06:15.200 --> 02:06:17.200
And bam, combo broken.

02:06:17.200 --> 02:06:19.200
It's playing slag work.

02:06:19.200 --> 02:06:21.200
You hear, oh, you got me.

02:06:21.200 --> 02:06:23.200
That's fucked up.

02:06:23.200 --> 02:06:24.200
That's how it was.

02:06:24.200 --> 02:06:26.200
I wish the timing was just that good.

02:06:26.200 --> 02:06:30.200
A few people at Paramount that thought it was a good idea

02:06:30.200 --> 02:06:33.200
to do yet another movie about Tupac.

02:06:33.200 --> 02:06:35.200
Yes, they're making another Tupac movie.

02:06:35.200 --> 02:06:37.200
Tupac Resurrection.

02:06:37.200 --> 02:06:44.200
I'm sorry. That's cool. That's cool.

02:06:45.200 --> 02:06:52.200
Dude, Tupac gets more sequels than Batman. We're all going to go opening day.

02:06:52.200 --> 02:06:57.200
Tupac resurrection opening day. Hey, seriously.

02:06:57.200 --> 02:07:04.200
It's going to be fulsome. Come on. Anyway.

02:07:04.200 --> 02:07:10.000
So yeah, that sucks and I'm trying to think what oh, yeah f you too

02:07:11.940 --> 02:07:14.440
Pretty much Oh f you the fat bitch

02:07:14.440 --> 02:07:16.440
Oh the stupid kid that was actually

02:07:16.600 --> 02:07:21.680
Asking begging for money while playing DDR and they kept getting louder and louder because I was ignoring him

02:07:22.360 --> 02:07:23.800
What?

02:07:23.800 --> 02:07:30.800
Do you have a dog as I can have no do you have any tokens I have? No, why is it through my chair again?

02:07:30.800 --> 02:07:39.060
p0k3smot42o1

02:07:39.060 --> 02:07:43.060
p0k3smot42o1

02:07:43.060 --> 02:07:49.060
p0k3smot42o

02:07:49.060 --> 02:07:56.060
p0k3smot42o

02:07:56.060 --> 02:08:24.060
p0k3smot42o i have satan

02:08:24.060 --> 02:08:30.060
you will die your chair has been liberated from the microphone

02:08:30.060 --> 02:08:32.060
cord f either john ritter dying

02:08:32.060 --> 02:08:35.060
doesn't he know that he has entertainment he has to do

02:08:35.060 --> 02:08:37.060
why does he have to go off heart problems now

02:08:37.060 --> 02:08:39.060
it's because he wasn't eating enough bacon

02:08:39.060 --> 02:08:43.060
he has to condition his heart for bad food

02:08:43.060 --> 02:08:45.060
i blame him

02:08:45.060 --> 02:08:47.060
actually i blame suzanne summers

02:08:47.060 --> 02:08:49.060
it was all her fault

02:08:49.060 --> 02:08:51.860
Suzanne Somers is the death of him.

02:08:51.860 --> 02:08:54.380
John Ritter sucked anyway.

02:08:54.380 --> 02:08:56.860
I grew up with the Reese Company, hello.

02:08:56.860 --> 02:08:59.420
But it was Suzanne Somers.

02:08:59.420 --> 02:09:02.860
When I read that he died, the only thing that I could think of was this movie that I saw on TV.

02:09:02.860 --> 02:09:05.500
If you have to be stuck on an island,

02:09:05.500 --> 02:09:08.460
fighting off Indians with either Suzanne Somers

02:09:08.460 --> 02:09:13.100
or John Ritter, you will want John Ritter on your side.

02:09:13.100 --> 02:09:17.020
Suzanne Somers would be scarier.

02:09:17.020 --> 02:09:18.060
Am I right?

02:09:18.060 --> 02:09:23.060
Yeah, but that's the whole point. All you have to do is start crying and talking about the starving children in China.

02:09:23.060 --> 02:09:27.060
Oh, and the other thing, the FU segment left like ten minutes ago.

02:09:27.060 --> 02:09:28.060
I got one more.

02:09:28.060 --> 02:09:39.060
Okay, FU to J-Lo and Ben Affleck, because guess what, your marriage lasted as long as Geely did in the box office.

02:09:39.060 --> 02:09:41.060
Bam!

02:09:41.060 --> 02:09:44.060
You suck. They broke up.

02:09:44.060 --> 02:09:47.060
Because he had second thoughts. He's like, dude, I don't know if I can marry her.

02:09:47.060 --> 02:09:51.060
He's such a pansy.

02:09:51.060 --> 02:09:53.060
Her ass comes alive at night.

02:09:53.060 --> 02:09:56.060
No, I can't handle it.

02:09:56.060 --> 02:10:01.060
I'm looking at a bunch of straight men talking about the wedding of Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez.

02:10:01.060 --> 02:10:04.060
I can't believe they're now going to get married.

02:10:04.060 --> 02:10:05.060
Gay.

02:10:05.060 --> 02:10:07.060
Thank you for picking that.

02:10:07.060 --> 02:10:11.060
The other ironic thing is that I could give less than a shit about them.

02:10:11.060 --> 02:10:14.060
I don't fucking care. I don't care what the bitch is wearing.

02:10:14.060 --> 02:10:21.060
I don't care where they're getting married. I don't care if they broke up. I don't care if they mate. I don't care. Let's watch some guns.

02:10:21.060 --> 02:10:24.060
It's a good thing because they're not going to breed now.

02:10:24.060 --> 02:10:32.060
And you know what's funny is NASA's crashing a 1.5 billion dollar satellite or whatever or probe into a house.

02:10:32.060 --> 02:10:38.060
Into their house? No, into Jupiter because they're afraid that bacteria might infect the moon around Jupiter.

02:11:08.060 --> 02:11:14.100
I hope there's an evolving civilization on Jupiter, and it crushes them all.

02:11:14.100 --> 02:11:18.260
It would be in Jupiter, because Jupiter's a big gaseous mass.

02:11:18.260 --> 02:11:21.580
Much like Suzanne Somers, okay.

02:11:21.580 --> 02:11:25.060
Again, bam.

02:11:25.060 --> 02:11:26.060
You're so punny.

02:11:26.060 --> 02:11:28.740
Oh, is it my turn?

02:11:28.740 --> 02:11:29.660
Room's turn.

02:11:29.660 --> 02:11:36.700
I've got a couple of FUs, a couple of political FUs, actually.

02:11:36.700 --> 02:11:39.080
F you to uh...

02:11:39.080 --> 02:11:40.660

02:11:49.220 --> 02:11:51.500
the one who's got like five percent

02:11:51.500 --> 02:11:53.500

02:11:53.500 --> 02:11:58.620

and um... she supports everything i believe it

02:12:08.380 --> 02:12:09.980
and you suck

02:12:09.980 --> 02:12:14.640
i think i think i think i think we're going to have to be down

02:12:14.640 --> 02:12:17.620
she actually needs more votes

02:12:17.620 --> 02:12:21.080
for not getting up close

02:12:21.080 --> 02:12:25.380
and i'll tell you i'm telling her body like the other candidate

02:12:25.380 --> 02:12:28.620
well she's not going to go to your she's just getting uh... a bunch of phone

02:12:28.620 --> 02:12:29.580
calls

anyway i'd also a f you to tom mcclintock for uh... being an ass

02:12:34.820 --> 02:12:36.900
and uh...

02:12:36.900 --> 02:12:42.120
on a side note i'd like to say f you to nomo ono and uh...

02:12:42.120 --> 02:12:46.520
and uh... silent profit for twisting my fragile little mind

02:12:46.520 --> 02:12:48.320
and uh...

02:12:48.320 --> 02:12:51.960
all i have left to say is mazel tov

02:12:51.960 --> 02:12:53.320
my turn to rant

02:12:53.320 --> 02:12:55.280
uh...

02:12:55.280 --> 02:12:57.560
okay uh...

02:12:57.560 --> 02:12:59.680
how come there's no music

02:12:59.680 --> 02:13:00.700
i can't hear it

02:13:00.700 --> 02:13:04.580
well then you should turn up your hearing aid

02:13:04.580 --> 02:13:06.820
WHAT?! SONNY?!

02:13:06.820 --> 02:13:10.020
Okay, um...

02:13:10.020 --> 02:13:14.100
For one, fuck traffic.

02:13:14.100 --> 02:13:18.340
Cause I hate traffic, and it's a pain in the ass, especially on every freeway.

02:13:18.340 --> 02:13:21.580
And all the people who were on the road today.

02:13:21.580 --> 02:13:26.260
Yes, that dumb bitch that wouldn't get out of my fucking lane.

02:13:26.260 --> 02:13:28.460
That woman, oh my god, that woman was stupid.

02:13:28.460 --> 02:13:33.940
And did you see the big dent in the back of her van? Yeah, it was probably from somebody she cut off like that.

02:13:33.940 --> 02:13:35.940
She deserved it, bitch.

02:13:35.940 --> 02:13:39.940
She looks like Sloth from The Goonies.

02:13:39.940 --> 02:13:42.940
I didn't get to see her, but I got to see you flip her off.

02:13:42.940 --> 02:13:49.940
You were a sick bastard.

02:13:49.940 --> 02:13:55.940
Fuck Disneyland for ruining Big Thunder Mountain Railroad by having somebody die on it.

02:13:55.940 --> 02:14:02.940
Because I love that ride, and now it's a death trap.

02:14:02.940 --> 02:14:07.940
I'm waiting for a bunch of people to dial and you know Mr. Toad's wild ride

02:14:07.940 --> 02:14:11.940
Can we get thrown out of a car and land on the ground and get run over by a car on a track?

02:14:11.940 --> 02:14:14.940
One of the animatronics runs over him

02:14:14.940 --> 02:14:18.940
Or I bet he has someone to fall off of the balcony in the ghost house

02:14:18.940 --> 02:14:20.940
In the haunted mansion

02:14:20.940 --> 02:14:23.940
That'd be great

02:14:23.940 --> 02:14:29.940
Then that supposed rising elevator will actually collapse

02:14:29.940 --> 02:14:34.940
And then, uh, fuck skin allergies, because they suck.

02:14:34.940 --> 02:14:40.940
And fuck every kind of medicine that I've been prescribed to fix it and has it worked.

02:14:40.940 --> 02:14:45.940
Or made it worse, because it sucks.

02:14:45.940 --> 02:14:53.940
And, uh, fuck not being able to figure out anything that I wanted to rant about when I actually get here.

02:14:53.940 --> 02:14:54.940
Because I, this morning...

02:14:54.940 --> 02:14:56.940
Have you got it all out in the car?

02:14:56.940 --> 02:15:07.940
I might have, yes, but I always think of stuff like on the way, like before I come, even leave to come here, and now I'm like, okay, you can have the microphone when I'm done looking.

02:15:07.940 --> 02:15:10.940
Okay, do you have a microphone now? But I'm not done yet.

02:15:10.940 --> 02:15:13.940
Okay, uh, let's see.

02:15:13.940 --> 02:15:19.940
Fuck the DDR machine at Tactical Express in Davis because it's shit now.

02:15:19.940 --> 02:15:23.940
I mean, it was kinda, it was crap before, but it's shit now.

02:15:23.940 --> 02:15:36.940
Fuck Fuzzy's Health Drinks, because those gave me really bad diarrhea the past few days.

02:15:36.940 --> 02:15:42.940
They taste good, but it doesn't come out the other end very well.

02:15:42.940 --> 02:15:45.940
Thank you for that information that we didn't need to know.

02:15:45.940 --> 02:15:53.220
No, you need to know that, because it can save you from a diarrhea trip.

02:15:53.220 --> 02:15:54.780
Who drinks anything like that?

02:15:54.780 --> 02:15:55.780
Really?

02:15:55.780 --> 02:15:59.780
It looks like they have diarrhea going in.

02:15:59.780 --> 02:16:03.700
But it's fruity, and it's colorful, and it's healthy.

02:16:03.700 --> 02:16:04.700
Diarrhea?

02:16:04.700 --> 02:16:06.700
Please pass the microphone.

02:16:06.700 --> 02:16:07.700
No!

02:16:07.700 --> 02:16:12.580
I don't feel like passing the microphone yet.

02:16:12.580 --> 02:16:19.220
I got one more real quick and it's quiet quiet quiet time quiet time okay f you to the neighbor

02:16:19.220 --> 02:16:27.860
upstairs because she's a racist she she she claims okay now get this cake this is her

02:16:27.860 --> 02:16:33.060
reasoning she told she warned me and my girlfriend about the evil mexicans around here that go

02:16:33.060 --> 02:16:39.780
and steal tools and she says i can i quote yeah i was watching my allergies and i saw

02:16:39.780 --> 02:16:42.440
The Mexicans, and they were looking at your tools.

02:16:42.440 --> 02:16:46.140
How can you physically watch allergies?

02:16:46.140 --> 02:16:51.780
There goes an allergy! Oh, I better stay away from that one.

02:16:51.780 --> 02:16:57.640
So, she sees an evil racist. I told you she was crazy. I knew it. I knew it all.

02:16:57.640 --> 02:17:02.420
She gets racist. What's that with that sign over there, that cord that says Negro Bar?

02:17:02.420 --> 02:17:08.100
Mexicans stole my stereo. That's really the name of the bar. I hate to break it to you, but it really is called that.

02:17:08.100 --> 02:17:13.840
it's because it's spanish for black bar

02:17:13.840 --> 02:17:15.060
anyway

02:17:15.060 --> 02:17:17.760
bradley

02:17:17.760 --> 02:17:19.160
bradley's turn

02:17:19.160 --> 02:17:22.960
alright uh... fuck you to running out of money cause I'm almost out now

02:17:22.960 --> 02:17:24.920
and fuck you to the

02:17:24.920 --> 02:17:26.480
crappy economy

02:17:26.480 --> 02:17:29.800
me for taking so long to get to the crappy economy to find a

02:17:29.800 --> 02:17:32.640
maybe a crappy job I have to go

02:17:32.640 --> 02:17:33.880
just to stay out here

02:17:33.880 --> 02:17:36.880
Well, I've been talking to him about it later.

02:17:36.880 --> 02:17:38.880
It's something good.

02:17:38.880 --> 02:17:42.880
It doesn't require too much talking to people, because I'll suck at that.

02:17:42.880 --> 02:17:46.880
Yeah, that's good.

02:17:46.880 --> 02:17:49.880
See, that's why I couldn't get Bradley a job at Health Net, because I...

02:17:49.880 --> 02:17:53.880
Oh, shit, I just gave that away where I work, but...

02:17:53.880 --> 02:17:56.880
He is over there. He was at Death Net.

02:17:56.880 --> 02:17:59.880
He's at Death Net.

02:17:59.880 --> 02:18:02.880
cuz most of the people there take calls, so, you know.

02:18:02.880 --> 02:18:06.880
I don't ever hear you talk.

02:18:06.880 --> 02:18:09.880
Yeah.

02:18:09.880 --> 02:18:14.880
Okay, uh, let's see.

02:18:14.880 --> 02:18:19.880
Fuck you to having my hair being too long, it's getting annoying.

02:18:19.880 --> 02:18:21.880
Time to cut it.

02:18:21.880 --> 02:18:23.880
Low money, I can't really go to the barber.

02:18:23.880 --> 02:18:26.880
I've cut my hair like twice.

02:18:26.880 --> 02:18:28.880
I've cut my hair like the last two times.

02:18:29.880 --> 02:18:32.880
I wonder if anyone noticed because it probably looked crappy.

02:18:33.880 --> 02:18:36.880
Well, it's grown out now.

02:18:38.880 --> 02:18:43.880
And fuck you to perfume inserts and cologne inserts. I hate smelling that shit all the time.

02:18:44.880 --> 02:18:48.880
It comes in the mail. It smells up the mailbox. It smells up everything.

02:18:48.880 --> 02:18:50.880
It smells up your mail.

02:18:50.880 --> 02:18:57.120
Fuck you to people who wear too much cologne and perfume.

02:18:57.120 --> 02:19:00.120
You stunk before you put it on, and then you stunk after.

02:19:00.120 --> 02:19:01.120
Even worse.

02:19:01.120 --> 02:19:02.120
Yeah.

02:19:02.120 --> 02:19:03.120
And...

02:19:03.120 --> 02:19:04.120
I don't know.

02:19:04.120 --> 02:19:18.880
In the general, fuck you to every other crappy thing in the world.

02:19:18.880 --> 02:19:25.880
the

02:19:26.060 --> 02:19:29.060

02:19:31.100 --> 02:19:34.640
puppies ask you about an arena tonight actually tomorrow's press tomorrow's

02:19:34.640 --> 02:19:36.100

and they're celebrating tonight

02:19:37.960 --> 02:19:40.760
because they're actually come they're actually coming over for vanilla sky

02:19:40.760 --> 02:19:41.880
tomorrow believe it or not

02:19:41.880 --> 02:19:44.920
well there is this good

02:19:44.920 --> 02:19:49.080
happy birthday bread

02:19:49.080 --> 02:19:56.080
almost a lot of cold winter nights a lot of birthdays in september i noticed

02:19:56.160 --> 02:19:59.560
did anyone notice that i had one?

02:19:59.560 --> 02:20:01.040
i won't tell

02:20:01.040 --> 02:20:03.920
see you keep it a secret how do you show this to no one in the news?

02:20:03.920 --> 02:20:10.040
there's actually an entry in my live journal that will tell you which day it was because it's a clue

02:20:10.040 --> 02:20:13.880
there's an entry there and then

02:20:13.880 --> 02:20:15.880
Well, happy birthday whenever it is.

02:20:15.880 --> 02:20:18.880
It was early in the month, very early.

02:20:18.880 --> 02:20:21.880
It's when I went to the DMV, so you can figure it out from there.

02:20:21.880 --> 02:20:22.880
I gotcha.

02:20:22.880 --> 02:20:25.880
I had to renew my license that day.

02:20:25.880 --> 02:20:28.880
And that was fun waiting three hours.

02:20:28.880 --> 02:20:36.880
At least they didn't charge me for not updating my dress for two years.

02:20:36.880 --> 02:20:42.880
Because I feel like updating your dress is a $100 fine.

02:20:42.880 --> 02:20:44.880
That's fine, that's good.

02:21:12.880 --> 02:21:16.880
Dragon Rock Online. There's got to be a faster way to level up my acolyte, dammit.

02:21:16.880 --> 02:21:18.880
Early for your...oh, never mind. That was a private interview.

02:21:18.880 --> 02:21:22.880
Jamie says she will take you to level up.

02:21:22.880 --> 02:21:27.880
DarkTetsuya says, F you to the stupid hit driving the pickup truck full of crap on the way to my girlfriend's.

02:21:27.880 --> 02:21:32.880
He must have been doing 20 miles an hour.

02:21:32.880 --> 02:21:36.880
Pixie Dust says, F you to work cutting my hours down to 26.

02:21:36.880 --> 02:21:39.880
F you to this ugly, bitchy girl that I want to smack so bad.

02:22:39.880 --> 02:22:40.880
computer monitor.

02:22:40.880 --> 02:22:52.080
Dolemek says, F you to not having two days off in a row, F you to not winning Mega Butts,

02:22:52.080 --> 02:22:54.800
which I'm guessing is a lottery in his state.

02:22:54.800 --> 02:23:02.200
Vidpawa says, F you to nothing in particular and everything in general.

02:23:02.200 --> 02:23:07.120
Too vague.

02:23:07.120 --> 02:23:09.600
Everybody in mind knows Stylin says,

02:23:09.600 --> 02:23:12.800
I'm my F-you for not having a job and my car being dead.

02:23:14.060 --> 02:23:14.900
Sucks.

02:23:17.140 --> 02:23:18.300
All right, that's it.

02:23:18.300 --> 02:23:20.180
That's all for the F-yous of the week.

02:23:20.180 --> 02:23:22.760
Finally, we're gonna do a quick break.

02:23:22.760 --> 02:23:23.820
We're gonna set up for match game

02:23:23.820 --> 02:23:25.300
and then we're gonna come back and do the match game.

02:23:25.300 --> 02:23:27.140
In the meantime, I'm gonna ask a question

02:23:27.140 --> 02:23:28.700
and the first two people to message me

02:23:28.700 --> 02:23:31.060
the answer to this question will get to play match game.

02:23:31.060 --> 02:23:33.100
It's a memory retention question.

02:23:33.100 --> 02:23:35.460
How well have you been listening to this show?

02:23:36.460 --> 02:23:37.460
Here we go.

02:23:40.460 --> 02:23:43.460
Not last week. Not last week. I'm going to ask question of this week.

02:23:43.460 --> 02:23:45.460
I didn't mean to put it on the microphone.

02:23:45.460 --> 02:23:48.460
It's an easy question. If you guys don't get it, you're retarded.

02:23:48.460 --> 02:23:49.460
Okay, here we go.

02:23:50.460 --> 02:23:54.460
What golf land does puppy work at over the summer?

02:23:54.460 --> 02:23:55.460
That's the question.

02:23:55.460 --> 02:23:58.460
First two people to private message me the answer get to play match game.

02:23:58.460 --> 02:24:02.560
match game

02:24:02.560 --> 02:24:06.140
and i realize all you're a different differing buffers and it's probably not

02:24:06.140 --> 02:24:09.020
fair for me to ask a question over the radio but you know what kids

02:24:09.020 --> 02:24:12.100
life's not fair

02:24:12.100 --> 02:24:14.580
so i feel that

02:24:14.580 --> 02:24:16.360

Feel this, feel these

02:26:21.780 --> 02:26:23.780

Think of this world without sound

02:26:25.780 --> 02:26:27.780
Can't even feel a heart pound

02:26:27.780 --> 02:26:29.780
Wasting time, wasting life, wasting self

02:26:29.780 --> 02:26:31.780

Easier to dance to, isn't it?

02:29:29.660 --> 02:29:35.260
to dance to than that freaking catch-up song, Orange Lounge Radio.

02:29:35.260 --> 02:29:38.180
Welcome back, boys and girls, to Orange Lounge Radio. We're going to play the match game

02:29:38.180 --> 02:29:42.540
now. Let me explain how the match game works. Basically, we're going to ask a question,

02:29:42.540 --> 02:29:45.100
and then there's a blank somewhere in that question. We're not really asking a question.

02:29:45.100 --> 02:29:47.780
We're saying a sentence. We're telling a story, and there's a blank in there somewhere.

02:29:47.780 --> 02:29:51.820
You get to fill it in. The contestants will have to fill it in, and

02:29:51.820 --> 02:29:58.080
for every celebrity they match, they get a point. So, a lot of you meanies in the chat

02:29:58.080 --> 02:30:01.600
room got a lot of people got the answer to the trivia question correct puppy

02:30:01.600 --> 02:30:05.680
worked at Castor Valley Golf Land over the summer and man when I told you you

02:30:05.680 --> 02:30:10.920
were too late you just you're an asshole no sex for you you suck I hate you and I

02:30:10.920 --> 02:30:15.840
hate your show get over it anyways the two of us need to dedicate to all these

02:30:15.840 --> 02:30:21.960
people yes yeah I have something else to dedicate a nice big laugh for me to you

02:30:21.960 --> 02:30:26.760
with love all right but I'm actually glad because we have two contestants who

02:30:26.760 --> 02:30:30.520
we have never had a plane match game before. So this should be interesting. Contestant

02:30:30.520 --> 02:30:38.680
number one, the first person to submit correctly was DJ Tyrant. Yes, a SoCal man. Contestant

02:30:38.680 --> 02:30:43.200
number two, and this should be interesting, this is going to be very interesting, no stylin',

02:30:43.200 --> 02:30:49.520
this is contestant number two. So contestants, you're going to send your answers. When I

02:30:49.520 --> 02:30:53.760
ask the question, you send your answers to me over private message in the chat room.

02:31:23.760 --> 02:31:28.760
But she was still the third person anyway. She would have had a ride if she said CVGL.

02:31:28.760 --> 02:31:30.760
But, anyway.

02:31:30.760 --> 02:31:35.760
Well, you know what? But she gets to listen and know that she inspired this wonderful segment tonight.

02:31:35.760 --> 02:31:39.760
Maybe we should have an honorable third party.

02:31:39.760 --> 02:31:41.760
Maybe we're running out of time.

02:31:41.760 --> 02:31:43.760
Okay.

02:31:43.760 --> 02:31:45.760
Here we go.

02:31:45.760 --> 02:31:47.760
As much as I love Mern.

02:31:47.760 --> 02:31:51.760
Alright, here we go. Question number one.

02:31:51.760 --> 02:31:54.560
One day Betty the Bamani addict

02:31:55.980 --> 02:31:57.980
Joey those are the music games

02:31:59.980 --> 02:32:02.540
Everybody by the way is playing tonight. Everybody is a celebrity here tonight

02:32:03.300 --> 02:32:06.960
Betty the Bamani addict decided she was tired of playing Beatmania

02:32:07.580 --> 02:32:10.980
Instead she decided to try the new Bamani game blank

02:32:11.900 --> 02:32:15.820
Jamie wrote all of tonight's questions, by the way, so if you don't like a question blame me

02:32:15.820 --> 02:32:22.140
Betty, the Bomani addict, decided she was tired of playing Beatmania.

02:32:22.140 --> 02:32:38.620
Instead, she decided to try the new Bomani game, Blank.

02:32:38.620 --> 02:32:41.780
The contestants are thinking.

02:32:41.780 --> 02:32:47.780
I have one contestant locked in with their answer, and I think that's both contestants.

02:32:47.780 --> 02:32:51.780
Let me just verify they did submit answers and not questions like, huh?

02:32:51.780 --> 02:32:52.780
Yeah, there's one.

02:32:52.780 --> 02:32:53.780
I got a huh.

02:32:53.780 --> 02:32:56.780
Give me a sec.

02:32:56.780 --> 02:33:01.780
I need another pen.

02:33:01.780 --> 02:33:02.780
Okay.

02:33:02.780 --> 02:33:06.780
Okay, I have both answers.

02:33:06.780 --> 02:33:10.780
Are all the celebrities ready?

02:33:10.780 --> 02:33:18.580
Okay, here we go. Alright, let's see what you guys put. You want to do the contestants

02:33:18.580 --> 02:33:31.300
first, or let's do the contestants first? What do you mean just in case?

02:33:31.300 --> 02:33:37.920
I don't care. I don't care. Tyrant says, instead she decided to try the

02:33:37.920 --> 02:33:44.920
the new Bimani game, Marshall Beat. That's not a new Bimani game but that's what he said,

02:33:44.920 --> 02:33:53.920
so there it is. Maybe it's new at the arcade, I don't know. NoStylin says, NoStylin says

02:33:53.920 --> 02:34:00.920
Betty decided to try the Noobamani game. DDR beat their meat.

02:34:00.920 --> 02:34:11.760
Okay, let's see. Loki, your answer was? He decided to try the Noobamani game. Marshall

02:34:11.760 --> 02:34:18.760
beat off. Oh, so close! Do you think that's a, do you think that's a, you know what, cause

02:34:18.960 --> 02:34:25.320
Tyrant put Marshall beat in all caps. Beat is in caps, so the emphasis was on the beat.

02:34:25.320 --> 02:34:29.320
We want to give them both a point? Give them both a point. Okay, so they both get a point

02:34:29.320 --> 02:34:32.920
for that, cause they're both kind of close. Okay. A point for Tyrant and a point for No

02:34:32.920 --> 02:34:39.800
Sound. This is amazing! Most number of points scored in the game ever. My answer, my answer

02:34:39.800 --> 02:34:47.720
was they decided to play SARS mania. Not a match, sorry. Now Joey, this should be fun

02:34:47.720 --> 02:34:53.960
because Joey got to see DDR, well Joey actually got introduced to the whole DDR obsession

02:34:53.960 --> 02:34:58.320
of ours this weekend, so he's still kind of catching up on all the inside jokes, so this

02:34:58.320 --> 02:35:07.160
should be great. Yeah, well the answer that I picked was beat me down. Beat me down! That's

02:35:07.160 --> 02:35:08.160
It's good.

02:35:08.160 --> 02:35:09.160
It's like punch mania, kind of.

02:35:09.160 --> 02:35:10.160
But not a match.

02:35:10.160 --> 02:35:13.840
So it sucks to be a contestant.

02:35:13.840 --> 02:35:17.840
Mine was monkey mania pooflinging edition.

02:35:17.840 --> 02:35:21.720
Monkey mania pooflinging edition, no I'm sorry that is not a match.

02:35:21.720 --> 02:35:22.720
Puppy.

02:35:22.720 --> 02:35:26.880
I said spoon freaks.

02:35:26.880 --> 02:35:30.240
Spoon freaks is not a match.

02:35:30.240 --> 02:35:32.960
I said forehead smacking mania.

02:35:32.960 --> 02:35:36.160
Forehead smacking mania, fun but no.

02:35:36.160 --> 02:35:44.520
night I'd kick a baby mania baby mania wonderful however not a match so after

02:35:44.520 --> 02:35:48.440
the first round it's all tied up one to one five questions to go you guys ready

02:35:48.440 --> 02:35:57.560

02:36:24.800 --> 02:36:30.640
the chat room or waiting on our contestants to answer this question. Sally the shopaholic

02:36:30.640 --> 02:36:41.840
was so excited. The outlet mall had a new store that sold nothing but blank. I have

02:36:41.840 --> 02:36:43.480
One contestant.

02:36:43.480 --> 02:36:44.480
I'm just waiting on the other one.

02:36:44.480 --> 02:36:45.480
I'm ready.

02:36:45.480 --> 02:36:46.480
Okay.

All right, here we go, let's read the, all the celebrities are done, right?

02:37:07.320 --> 02:37:08.320
Yes, okay.

02:37:08.320 --> 02:37:09.320
Here we go.

02:37:09.320 --> 02:37:13.880

02:37:34.440 --> 02:37:38.320
You never know. Flickin Nick Dickey. I don't know. I was thinking about that one.

02:37:38.320 --> 02:37:42.920
Somehow I don't think it's going to match. I don't know if it's going to match, but I

02:37:42.920 --> 02:37:52.960
said Cuban immigrants. A store that sold nothing but Cuban immigrants. No, not a match, unfortunately.

02:37:52.960 --> 02:37:57.960
I put, Sally the Shopaholic was so excited, there was a store that sold nothing but babies!

02:37:57.960 --> 02:38:00.960
Babies, not a match, sorry.

02:38:00.960 --> 02:38:01.960
Joey.

02:38:01.960 --> 02:38:02.960
Panties?

02:38:02.960 --> 02:38:03.960
Panties?

02:38:03.960 --> 02:38:04.960
Panties?

02:38:04.960 --> 02:38:12.000
Panties, although I think Flick-a-nick-dicky might be a term for panties, I'm not sure

02:38:12.000 --> 02:38:13.880
and I can't look it up so you lose.

02:38:13.880 --> 02:38:14.880
Good point.

02:38:14.880 --> 02:38:15.880
No points.

02:38:15.880 --> 02:38:16.880
Alright, going on.

02:38:16.880 --> 02:38:17.880

02:38:21.880 --> 02:38:25.880
You know, I usually expect people to pick Propel when I'm playing.

02:38:25.880 --> 02:38:26.880
Yeah, well.

02:38:26.880 --> 02:38:27.880
And no, stupid.

02:38:27.880 --> 02:38:30.880
We have new contestants tonight, give them a break.

02:38:30.880 --> 02:38:31.880
Puppy.

02:38:31.880 --> 02:38:34.880

02:38:34.880 --> 02:38:35.880
Defective condoms.

02:38:35.880 --> 02:38:36.880
Oh, nice.

02:38:36.880 --> 02:38:41.880
I don't know how a store would stay open, so I'm not, but okay.

02:38:41.880 --> 02:38:42.880
Bubby.

02:38:42.880 --> 02:38:44.880
My answer is, detached eyeballs.

02:38:44.880 --> 02:38:47.880
Detached eyeballs, lovely, no.

02:38:47.880 --> 02:38:48.880
A punk night.

02:38:48.880 --> 02:39:03.320
Alright, my answer was down syndrome porn. Down syndrome porn, oh. Wow. Wow, I'm so glad

02:39:03.320 --> 02:39:09.840

02:39:09.840 --> 02:39:17.040
And those are pity points by the way. Here we go, next question. Yay. Alright, shut

02:39:17.040 --> 02:39:24.500
up here we go. Miyako was so depressed. She had been drugged and pulled into an

02:39:24.500 --> 02:39:29.160
island with her classmates to do battle royale. And, the weapon she was given was

02:39:29.160 --> 02:39:35.560
a blank. All right. She'd been drugged and pulled to the island with her classmates

02:39:35.560 --> 02:39:54.880
to do battle royale and the weapon she was given was a blank we're just

02:39:54.880 --> 02:39:57.400
waiting for the contestants to answer and waiting for all the celebrities

02:39:57.400 --> 02:40:01.280

02:40:01.280 --> 02:40:04.340
island with her classmates to battle royale and the weapon she was given was

02:40:04.340 --> 02:40:32.620
a blank? Alright, well we have music going. Mid Palace has a cassette tape of old Orange

02:40:32.620 --> 02:40:42.520
lounge episodes. It's kind of close to what I put though. Okay, here we go. Alright, we

02:40:42.520 --> 02:40:47.220
have the contestants logged in. Starting off with Tyrant. Miyako was so depressed she got

02:40:47.220 --> 02:40:49.800
drugged and pulled to the island with her classmates to do battle royale. The weapon

02:40:49.800 --> 02:40:55.520
she was given was a, Tyrant says, a trout. Like IRC, get it, a trout. Ha ha ha. Okay,

02:40:55.520 --> 02:41:01.920
that was a cute answer, I like that. Alright. No Styler says the weapon she was given was

02:41:01.920 --> 02:41:08.600
There's a magic kicky Dicky and the Nicky.

02:41:08.600 --> 02:41:10.640
Oh Nicky please, not so quicky.

02:41:10.640 --> 02:41:11.640
Okay.

02:41:11.640 --> 02:41:12.640
Wow.

02:41:12.640 --> 02:41:17.540
Loki, your answer please.

02:41:17.540 --> 02:41:21.480
Three words, Iraqi suicide babies.

02:41:21.480 --> 02:41:25.800
Awesome, anybody that used to listen to this show would get that joke.

02:41:25.800 --> 02:41:31.320
I said the weapon she was given was a bad joke book offered by 23rd Magus.

02:41:31.320 --> 02:41:38.320
a match, sorry. No, she'd win. She'd win. I just, I'm going to get killed. Joey, a multi-purpose

02:41:43.340 --> 02:41:49.520
magic banana. A multi-purpose magic banana. She'd probably be too preoccupied with that

02:41:49.520 --> 02:41:55.160
and get caught in a danger zone and her collar would explode. Mine was a yoko on a CD and

02:41:55.160 --> 02:42:00.200
a CD player. Oh, very nice. There's a lot of this theme of like hearing things. Well,

02:42:00.200 --> 02:42:05.200
0blivixx,0blivixx,0blivixx,0blivixx.

02:42:30.200 --> 02:42:43.200
A monkey launcher. A monkey launcher, lovely. Alright. Okay, so not a match for either contestant, sorry.

02:42:45.200 --> 02:42:56.200
No, in the book, in the book they have different weapons than in the movie and someone got a sticky dart gun. No, got a dart board and darts as their weapon.

02:42:56.200 --> 02:43:00.800
all right moving on here we go still want a piece

02:43:00.800 --> 02:43:05.800
Francine the fanfic writer was getting impatient for the next Harry Potter book

02:43:05.800 --> 02:43:08.840
so she decided to write it herself

02:43:08.840 --> 02:43:13.440
but she couldn't think of a good name finally she decided to name it

02:43:13.440 --> 02:43:29.260
Harry Potter and the Blank. Francine, the fanfic writer, was getting impatient for the

02:43:29.260 --> 02:43:32.700
next Harry Potter book, so she decided to write it herself, but she couldn't think of

02:43:32.700 --> 02:43:53.420
a good name. Finally, she decided to name it Harry Potter and the blank.

02:43:53.420 --> 02:44:15.480
She decided to name it Harry Potter in the blank.

02:44:15.480 --> 02:44:18.200
I'm just waiting for both contestants to lock in with an answer here.

02:44:18.200 --> 02:44:22.800
Finally, she decided to name it Harry Potter in the blank.

02:44:22.800 --> 02:44:23.800
I need an answer, too.

02:44:23.800 --> 02:44:24.800
All right.

02:44:24.800 --> 02:44:25.800
Okay.

02:44:25.800 --> 02:44:26.800
Here we go.

02:44:26.800 --> 02:44:27.800
Ready?

02:44:27.800 --> 02:44:28.800
Are we all ready?

02:44:28.800 --> 02:44:29.800
Yes.

02:44:29.800 --> 02:44:30.800
Ding, ding.

02:44:30.800 --> 02:44:31.800
Everybody's named.

02:44:31.800 --> 02:44:32.800
All right.

02:44:32.800 --> 02:44:33.800
No silence says.

02:44:33.800 --> 02:44:44.800
She decided to call it Harry Potter gone wild with a bomb and a cannon.

02:44:44.800 --> 02:44:53.600
Harry Potter gone wild with a bomb in a can of some sort

02:44:53.600 --> 02:44:59.680
DJ Tyrant Harry Potter and the breast implant

02:44:59.680 --> 02:45:10.400
Loki. Let's see if we get a match. Damn, I have like two. Well, since they're both not

02:45:10.400 --> 02:45:17.720
matching anyways, Harry Potter and the Horny Catholic Priest, or Harry Potter and the Sex

02:45:17.720 --> 02:45:20.920
Change. But I like Horny Catholic Priest better.

02:45:20.920 --> 02:45:21.920
Would he be Harriet Potter?

02:45:21.920 --> 02:45:25.560
The Horny Catholic Priest would be kind of close. That would be like a half point. But

02:45:25.560 --> 02:45:27.360
Horny Catholic Priest was your first pick.

02:45:27.360 --> 02:45:29.040
Would he be Harriet Potter?

02:45:29.040 --> 02:45:33.800
I was kind of stretched for an answer, so I used a good classic inside joke.

02:45:33.800 --> 02:45:37.760
I said Harry Potter and the Stars Infested Monkeys.

02:45:37.760 --> 02:45:40.960
Joey.

02:45:40.960 --> 02:45:43.600
Harry Potter and the Search for Sexual Release.

02:45:43.600 --> 02:45:44.600
Nice.

02:45:44.600 --> 02:45:45.600
Whale.

02:45:45.600 --> 02:45:46.600
Jamie.

02:45:46.600 --> 02:45:51.120
I said, and people who actually are fans of the book would get it, and it also fits in

02:45:51.120 --> 02:45:55.160
with the show, Harry Potter and the Magical Bouncing Ferret.

02:45:55.160 --> 02:46:13.520
Harry Potter and the Swedish Furniture Good answer, but not a match.

02:46:13.520 --> 02:46:20.240
Harry Potter and the plus filled Acne of Doom Appropriate, but not a match.

02:46:20.240 --> 02:46:29.860
night. Harry Potter and the pile of dead babies. Not a match, I'm so sorry. Alright, here

02:46:29.860 --> 02:46:33.680
we go, two more questions to go. Will they break the tie of one to one? Probably not,

02:46:33.680 --> 02:46:42.200
but let's keep playing anyway. Here we go. Perry the painter was working on his new masterpiece

02:46:42.200 --> 02:46:48.360
and ran out of a few of his paints. He was almost done, so to replace the missing paints

02:46:48.360 --> 02:46:55.280
he used blank. Perry the painter was working on his new masterpiece and he ran out of a

02:46:55.280 --> 02:47:17.280
few of his paints. He was almost done, so to replace the missing paints he used blank.

02:47:17.280 --> 02:47:22.320
The contestants are thinking about their answers.

02:47:22.320 --> 02:47:27.120
The celebrities are thinking about their answers.

02:47:27.120 --> 02:47:28.880
Here's the question one more time.

02:47:28.880 --> 02:47:34.260
Perry the painter was working on his new masterpiece and ran out of a few of his paints.

02:47:34.260 --> 02:47:40.720
He was almost done, so to replace the missing paints he used blank.

02:47:40.720 --> 02:47:42.280
I'm waiting on both contestants.

02:47:42.280 --> 02:47:45.280
Oh, looks like we might have one.

02:47:45.280 --> 02:48:10.040
p0k3smot42o

02:48:10.040 --> 02:48:16.720
Tyrant said, Perry the painter was working on his new masterpiece and ran out of a few

02:48:16.720 --> 02:48:17.720
of his paints.

02:48:17.720 --> 02:48:26.480
He was almost done, so to replace the missing paints he used pus from zits.

02:48:26.480 --> 02:48:27.480
No stylin says.

02:48:27.480 --> 02:48:32.560
To replace the paints he used the jizz and then afterwards decided to fap to some Orange

02:48:32.560 --> 02:48:33.560
Lounge Radio.

02:48:33.560 --> 02:48:34.560
Aw, how lovely.

02:48:34.560 --> 02:48:37.560
Way to show your love.

02:48:37.560 --> 02:48:39.560
Alright, uh, Loki.

02:48:41.560 --> 02:48:44.560
Um, he used clubbed baby seals.

02:48:48.560 --> 02:48:49.560
Nice, but not a match.

02:48:50.560 --> 02:48:53.560
Uh, I said he ran out of paint, so he decided to use skin.

02:48:54.560 --> 02:48:55.560
Not a match.

02:48:56.560 --> 02:48:57.560
I'm just being morbid.

02:48:59.560 --> 02:49:02.560
You know, I was gonna use jizz myself, but then I decided to just use blood.

02:49:04.560 --> 02:49:05.560
So simple, not a match.

02:49:05.560 --> 02:49:06.560
Jamie.

02:49:06.560 --> 02:49:25.560
The brains of golf lads children used the dog rotting on his doorstep.

02:49:25.560 --> 02:49:31.560
A bulimic person's vomit.

02:49:31.560 --> 02:49:40.560
A bulimic person's vomit. Colorful, not a match. Wow.

02:49:40.560 --> 02:49:52.160
Alright, here we go, last question. This is your last chance to get a point, otherwise

02:49:52.160 --> 02:49:55.520
we're going to have a tie and nobody likes a tie.

02:49:55.520 --> 02:49:58.500
Alright, here's a question.

02:49:58.500 --> 02:50:03.200
Kelly was tired of staying at home all day

02:50:03.200 --> 02:50:08.900
so she decided that she would leave. She hopped in her car and decided that she was

02:50:08.900 --> 02:50:10.920

02:54:52.320 --> 02:54:55.480
Put them on the fridge. Because they're not on the fridge. Because

02:54:55.480 --> 02:54:58.120
people need to be creative and put erotic phrases on the fridge.

Plus, DDR Max 2 is going to have an all-new updated system for the diet mode.

02:56:11.180 --> 02:56:16.060
They're going to have, like, you know, workout courses you can do, like low impact, high impact,

02:56:16.280 --> 02:56:20.080
I'm lazy, you know, that type of thing.

02:56:20.960 --> 02:56:22.080
So, fun stuff like that.

02:56:22.080 --> 02:56:24.940
And you're probably going to see max period at some point in there.

02:56:24.940 --> 02:56:29.940
Kitten. That's a dumbass name for a freaking song I've ever seen.

02:56:29.940 --> 02:56:34.940
You know what's interesting? I'm noticing more and more that Max 2 is basically a US

02:56:34.940 --> 02:56:38.940
version of Xtreme. It really is. It's a US version of the Japanese Xtreme.

02:56:38.940 --> 02:56:39.940
So that means it's going to suck?

02:56:39.940 --> 02:56:43.940
No, I think it's actually going to be really good because we've already all played Xtreme.

02:56:43.940 --> 02:56:49.940
You know what's interesting though? We played the demo. Loki and I played the demo for Max

02:56:49.940 --> 02:56:53.940
2 USA. We have it. And we were playing D2R. The first thing I noticed is that D2R has

02:56:53.940 --> 02:56:58.680
D2R has Xtreme's video. It doesn't have the D2R video for Max 2 because they're different.

02:56:58.680 --> 02:57:04.040
If you think about it, yes they are. In Xtreme you had this, I recognize one of the videos,

02:57:04.040 --> 02:57:07.380
it's like a matrix effect where you have the numbers changing while it's running down the

02:57:07.380 --> 02:57:08.380
screen.

02:57:08.380 --> 02:57:09.380
That wasn't Max 2.

02:57:09.380 --> 02:57:15.320
No it wasn't, but it wasn't in the D2R video. I'm almost positive, I'm like 99% positive

02:57:15.320 --> 02:57:19.360
that D2R has a new video in this. It has Xtreme's video, not Max 2's video.

02:57:19.360 --> 02:57:21.800
Oh, it doesn't really matter, it's a background video.

02:57:21.800 --> 02:57:25.720
Yeah, I know. Not that we really give a shit, but that makes me think that, oh, it's based

02:57:25.720 --> 02:57:28.240
off Xtreme's engine, not Max 2.

02:57:28.240 --> 02:57:29.800
Well, it didn't...

02:57:29.800 --> 02:57:30.800
Whatever.

02:57:30.800 --> 02:57:32.360
Well, I thought they said that, didn't they?

02:57:32.360 --> 02:57:33.760
It's based off of Euromix 2.

02:57:33.760 --> 02:57:34.760
Ew!

02:57:34.760 --> 02:57:36.760
It's not an engine.

02:57:36.760 --> 02:57:37.760
So there.

02:57:37.760 --> 02:57:38.760
Euromix.

02:57:38.760 --> 02:57:44.200
I had a point I wanted to make. Also in Xtreme, they've announced that most of the unlocks

02:57:44.200 --> 02:57:47.800
from the arcade, I'm not gonna read the whole list, but pretty much anything that was unlocked

02:57:47.800 --> 02:57:55.000
by a code in the arcade, songs such as Sink, Dance Dance Revolution, Paranoia Survivor,

02:57:55.000 --> 02:57:56.520
etc. is a hidden track.

02:57:56.520 --> 02:58:00.440
Your mama's on crack rock, you should be in DDR.

02:58:00.440 --> 02:58:05.520
Pixie Dust is suggesting your mama's on crack rock should be in DDR Max 2.

02:58:05.520 --> 02:58:07.000
You should go suggest that in the DDR.

02:58:07.000 --> 02:58:10.520
That is the best suggestion ever to be in DDR.

02:58:10.520 --> 02:58:14.480
Not my mama, my mama in rehab.

02:58:14.480 --> 02:58:15.480
That song was the best.

02:58:15.480 --> 02:58:21.080
I have, like, on a tape that I made when I was in middle school.

02:58:21.080 --> 02:58:22.080
What a lovely thought.

02:58:22.080 --> 02:58:24.400
I'm going to go download that tonight.

02:58:24.400 --> 02:58:28.200
Okay, um, any other Bamani news anyone had to report?

02:58:28.200 --> 02:58:31.960
I mean, we've got the game, the game is out in a week and a half, Max 2.

02:58:31.960 --> 02:58:37.080
And, uh, Wednesday night, next, a week from Wednesday, we're going to do, um, what we

02:58:37.080 --> 02:58:41.120
did for Max 1, we're going to play it, we're going to just bring home the copy and play

02:58:41.120 --> 02:58:42.120
it on air.

02:58:42.120 --> 02:58:43.120
Yay.

02:58:43.120 --> 02:58:48.120
Although I believe it's actually being released on Tuesday, right?

02:58:48.120 --> 02:58:49.120
The 24th.

02:58:49.120 --> 02:58:50.120
The 24th is a Tuesday.

02:58:50.120 --> 02:58:51.120
Wednesday.

02:58:51.120 --> 02:58:52.120
Oh, it's Wednesday?

02:58:52.120 --> 02:58:53.120
I don't know anymore.

02:58:53.120 --> 02:58:55.120
I didn't know because I have to start classes on the 25th.

02:58:55.120 --> 02:58:56.120
Oh.

02:58:56.120 --> 02:58:57.120
It's Thursday.

02:58:57.120 --> 02:58:58.120
Well, we'll see.

02:58:58.120 --> 02:58:59.120
Plan on that Wednesday.

02:58:59.120 --> 02:59:02.120
If you're not able to get your copy of Max 2, don't worry about it.

02:59:02.120 --> 02:59:04.120
We're going to play it here and you can listen in.

02:59:04.120 --> 02:59:07.120
We'd like to live stream your video instead of just like a webcam.

02:59:07.120 --> 02:59:08.120
We'll see what we can do about that.

02:59:08.120 --> 02:59:09.120
So stay tuned for that.

02:59:09.120 --> 02:59:11.120
That'll be next Wednesday for sure.

02:59:11.120 --> 02:59:17.800
This Wednesday we're going to have some surprise programming, who knows.

02:59:17.800 --> 02:59:22.520
Now is the part of the show I believe it's time to go around and gather everyone's final

02:59:22.520 --> 02:59:25.760
thoughts I think.

02:59:25.760 --> 02:59:26.760
Unless anyone else has Bamani's?

02:59:26.760 --> 02:59:29.760
No, they need to have the Oha Ska.

02:59:29.760 --> 02:59:30.760
Oha.

02:59:30.760 --> 02:59:31.760
Oha.

02:59:31.760 --> 02:59:32.760
Oha.

02:59:32.760 --> 02:59:33.760
Oha.

02:59:33.760 --> 02:59:34.760
Oha.

02:59:34.760 --> 02:59:35.760
Oha.

02:59:35.760 --> 02:59:36.760
That would be cool.

02:59:36.760 --> 02:59:38.620
Okay.

02:59:38.620 --> 02:59:39.620
Final thoughts time.

02:59:39.620 --> 02:59:40.660
I guess we're there.

02:59:40.660 --> 02:59:42.660
Anybody else have anything they want to bring up?

02:59:42.660 --> 02:59:47.660
Good, we can end this train wreck of a show.

02:59:47.660 --> 02:59:48.660
What?

02:59:48.660 --> 02:59:49.660
Play endearing music.

02:59:49.660 --> 02:59:50.660
Play endearing music.

02:59:50.660 --> 02:59:51.660
My point.

02:59:51.660 --> 02:59:52.660
What do you want?

02:59:52.660 --> 02:59:54.660
Give me a final thought, Dammit.

02:59:54.660 --> 02:59:58.660
Give me a final thought.

02:59:58.660 --> 02:59:59.660
College rules.

02:59:59.660 --> 03:00:00.660
Lovely.

03:00:00.660 --> 03:00:03.660
Bradley, do you have a final thought?

03:00:03.660 --> 03:00:07.660
Slam it, cram it, jam it, dammit.

03:00:07.660 --> 03:00:08.660
Okay.

03:00:08.660 --> 03:00:13.660
Punkknight, muzzletuff, I hate you.

03:00:17.660 --> 03:00:21.660
Jamie, oh, uh, Joey, do you have a final thought? No, he has no final thought.

03:00:21.660 --> 03:00:28.660
Uh, what, you wanna go last? My final thought is, um, yay.

03:00:28.660 --> 03:00:37.660
Loki, I'm gonna have an arcade cabinet and you don't, I'm gonna have an arcade cabinet and you don't.

03:00:37.660 --> 03:00:55.660
My final thought is go to your local game shop and pre-order Transformers Season 3 boxset and sign up for replay.darksakra.com

03:00:55.660 --> 03:01:06.660
And right after the show at 10pm, be sure to tune in to Conan O'Brien's 10th anniversary special, 9.30, 9.30, right, right now, right now, why are you all listening?

03:01:08.660 --> 03:01:19.660
Alright, so I guess that's a sign we need to end this show then. Final word of the show, I'll give it to Joey. He gets one word, you say one word and it's the final word of the show, so what is the final word of the show?

03:01:20.660 --> 03:01:21.660
P.A.C.E.

03:01:21.660 --> 03:01:27.660
You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

03:01:27.660 --> 03:01:32.100
Orange Lounge Radio is hosted by Dark Sakura, Sky and Loki.

03:01:32.100 --> 03:01:34.460
We expect you a nice play again.

03:01:34.460 --> 03:01:41.460
And now, here's your porch and cookie message of the day.

03:02:04.460 --> 03:02:29.260
We must be strong and brave, our home, we've got to save If we don't in just one year,

03:02:29.260 --> 03:02:34.640
Mother Earth will disappear!

03:02:34.640 --> 03:02:38.080
Fighting with the Gavilons, we won't stop until we've won.

03:02:38.080 --> 03:02:41.240
Then we'll return, and when we arrive,

03:02:41.240 --> 03:02:48.240
The Earth will survive with our Star Blazers!

03:02:48.240 --> 03:02:55.080
Thanks for listening, and we'll see you next week.
