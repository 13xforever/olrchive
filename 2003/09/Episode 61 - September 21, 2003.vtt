00:00.000 --> 00:13.000
Toto? I have a feeling we're not in Kansas anymore.

00:13.000 --> 00:21.000
You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio, the Monty Talk and then some.

00:21.000 --> 00:25.000
Uh, mostly the and then some part of that.

00:25.000 --> 00:29.000
Orange Lounge Radio is created by a bunch of potty-mouthed adults.

00:29.000 --> 00:35.000
Orange Lounge may contain sexual, perverted, and mildly retarded content.

00:35.000 --> 00:39.000
You probably shouldn't let your children listen to Orange Lounge Radio.

00:39.000 --> 00:41.000
Yes, I will spank your child.

00:41.000 --> 00:43.000
If you're not going to do your job, goddammit, I will.

00:48.000 --> 00:50.000
Well, here's to my big opening.

00:50.000 --> 00:52.000
A sphincter says why?

00:52.000 --> 00:54.000
I'm super. Thanks for asking.

00:54.000 --> 00:56.400
You little bitch troll from hell!

00:56.400 --> 00:57.600
What am I doing here?

00:57.600 --> 00:58.100
Haha!

00:58.100 --> 00:59.700
Nooo!

00:59.700 --> 01:00.200
Eh?

01:00.200 --> 01:01.000
Dodge this.

01:01.000 --> 01:02.000
Mm-hmm.

01:02.000 --> 01:04.100
This is a tasty burger.

01:04.100 --> 01:05.400
Look, you stupid bastard!

01:05.400 --> 01:06.800
You've got no arms left!

01:06.800 --> 01:07.800
Yes, I have!

01:07.800 --> 01:08.700
Look!

01:08.700 --> 01:09.900
There's a flesh wound.

01:09.900 --> 01:12.800
Searching for a boy in high school is that useless.

01:12.800 --> 01:17.000
It's searching for meaning in a polyshore.

01:17.000 --> 01:18.000
Oh, yeah?

01:18.000 --> 01:19.000
Well...

01:19.000 --> 01:21.600
I hope your babies look like monkeys.

01:21.600 --> 01:22.800
Dark Sakura.

01:22.800 --> 01:26.800
I had a sniff, but I'm playing it for the bartender, so suffer.

01:26.800 --> 01:28.800
Loki, I hate you.

01:28.800 --> 01:32.800
Orange Lounge Radio.

01:32.800 --> 01:36.800
We are live, finally.

01:36.800 --> 01:39.800
And this is episode number 61.

01:39.800 --> 01:41.800
Well, at least a fraction of it.

01:41.800 --> 01:45.800
The first 20 minutes is gone forever, but that's okay, we didn't do them.

01:45.800 --> 01:53.800
For September the 21st of 2003, you're tuned in to Bamani Scene's most comcast-hating radio station of all things B-Mani.

01:53.800 --> 01:57.800
My name is Rob Roberts, but you might know me as Sky. Joining me, as always, are my awesome co-hosts.

01:57.800 --> 02:02.800
In this corner, the happiest bunny on the farm is Jamie Summers. You know her better as Stark Sakura.

02:02.800 --> 02:04.800
There's nothing on my face.

02:04.800 --> 02:06.800
She's too busy playing dance summit right now.

02:06.800 --> 02:11.800
Well, you know, we have other things going on like the show that's more important.

02:11.800 --> 02:13.800
The game will have to come later.

02:13.800 --> 02:15.560
uh... in that corner

02:15.560 --> 02:20.640
it's mother say hello to protect that's a low-key

02:20.640 --> 02:27.460
you can't play play that they had been able to do something without a show

02:27.460 --> 02:29.400
why does knowing indoors

02:29.400 --> 02:32.400
uh... so i don't know i just knowing that battle for god i thought you were

02:32.400 --> 02:36.380
talking about real life i was like what the hell is stealing

02:36.380 --> 02:42.100
yes robert still outside that you know special one hundred degrees

02:42.100 --> 02:46.100
We know! Turn it off!

02:46.100 --> 02:50.100
No, you didn't want to talk when you had the mic, so nah!

02:50.100 --> 02:54.100
Bitch.

02:54.100 --> 02:58.100
I like Dance Summit. Okay, next.

02:58.100 --> 03:03.100
Alright. We're not going to take an opening break tonight, we're just going to go right into the show.

03:03.100 --> 03:07.100
Yeah, you had a twenty minute opening break before the show, so deal.

03:07.100 --> 03:12.500
So, hello, and welcome to Orange Lounge Radio episode number 61.

03:12.500 --> 03:14.300
We're going to get right into it.

03:14.300 --> 03:20.540
If you want to join our chat room, www.calibomani.com, click on Orange Lounge and click on chat.

03:20.540 --> 03:23.580
If we're a little dazed, you'll just have to forgive us, it's taking us a minute to

03:23.580 --> 03:26.460
kind of get back in the groove here, trying to do the show.

03:26.460 --> 03:29.020
Hey, get in the groove, I made a DDR game.

03:29.020 --> 03:30.020
No.

03:30.020 --> 03:31.020
Do you want to...

03:31.020 --> 03:32.020
Ow!

03:32.020 --> 03:33.020
Okay.

03:33.020 --> 03:35.020
Get out the whip, babe.

03:35.020 --> 03:40.020
All right, if you want to visit our webcam,

03:40.020 --> 03:42.260
because we have a lot of guests in the studio tonight,

03:42.260 --> 03:43.780
go to our chat room and they'll tell you

03:43.780 --> 03:44.980
how to get to the webcam, because we're not

03:44.980 --> 03:45.980
giving out the URL here.

03:45.980 --> 03:47.940
Because that's incentive to go to the chat.

03:47.940 --> 03:50.620
OK, let's go around and say who's here tonight,

03:50.620 --> 03:52.260
because we have a lot of guests here.

03:52.260 --> 03:54.660
So you know Dark, Sackler, and Loki, of course, by now.

03:54.660 --> 03:55.460
We also have.

03:55.460 --> 03:56.260
Say hello.

03:56.260 --> 03:58.860
It's Puppy over here.

03:58.860 --> 04:00.860
Cat Puppy is in the house.

04:00.860 --> 04:02.020
Yes, after.

04:02.020 --> 04:04.340
Be careful with that.

04:04.340 --> 04:09.060
you break something also with us tonight say hello to this is somebody who's new

04:09.060 --> 04:14.940
never been to the show say hello to pilot hyper girl hello how are you she

04:14.940 --> 04:19.300
brought her whip and everything so she's going to oh hello not in the house not

04:19.300 --> 04:28.100
in the house dear unless it's in the bedroom well you're 18 now huh when's

04:28.100 --> 04:31.300
your first movie coming out I'm just kidding it's not gonna happen with me

04:31.300 --> 04:45.340
We went with Randy, Yellow Jacket Boy, also known as DJ Taka on the boards, or Taka Shonen

04:45.340 --> 04:48.100
as you guys might know him on Cali Bumani.

04:48.100 --> 04:57.500
We also went with Aori, we went with BJ, and we went with Psycho Joe.

04:57.500 --> 05:00.540
Apparently clubbing is a place where everyone is either drunk or high.

05:00.540 --> 05:03.540
No, when I go. Well, drunk maybe.

05:03.540 --> 05:04.540
Incredibly high.

05:04.540 --> 05:08.540
I get drunk a lot. I don't get high. I don't do that. I don't endorse Swede.

05:08.540 --> 05:12.540
Now, drunk on the other hand is a different story.

05:12.540 --> 05:15.540
Yeah, drunk on the other hand is a completely different story.

05:15.540 --> 05:19.540
Okay, I'm noticing we're still having some connection stability issues.

05:19.540 --> 05:23.540
Like, our chat room is running fine, but the station seems to be having...

05:23.540 --> 05:24.540
Still, we don't have issues.

05:24.540 --> 05:27.540
Having a problem. Yeah, what is this show if we don't have issues?

05:27.540 --> 05:31.540
We're just going to keep going here, and you'll have to bear with us.

05:31.540 --> 05:35.540
You can address those cards and love letters to Comcast Cable, because that's where our

05:35.540 --> 05:36.540
problem lies right now.

05:36.540 --> 05:42.540
If you guys haven't heard already, because I heard this hit National News, California,

05:42.540 --> 05:47.540
Oregon, and Washington all had an outage on Comcast, so we all went down for about ten

05:47.540 --> 05:50.540
minutes, but for some reason, some areas went down for an hour, and we were one of those

05:50.540 --> 05:51.540
lucky areas.

05:51.540 --> 05:53.540
So anyway, bear with us.

05:53.540 --> 05:58.300
those lucky areas. So anyway, bear with us. The show will be played back in its entirety

05:58.300 --> 06:03.540
on Wednesday and Thursday, of course. The webcam is also being switched over to a one

06:03.540 --> 06:09.180
minute refresh because of the traffic on the net right now because of this Comcast outage.

06:09.180 --> 06:15.500
So I'm switching it over to one minute refresh. I think the buffer, introduce yourself one

06:15.500 --> 06:19.500
more time, dear, because I think the buffer hit right when you were introducing yourself.

06:19.500 --> 06:23.500
Hello! It's VHG. Yeah, okay.

06:24.500 --> 06:25.000
Hi!

06:25.000 --> 06:25.500
Alright.

06:25.500 --> 06:27.500
I was sitting here going, I'm a burp.

06:28.500 --> 06:31.500
Do you need to let out a burp, Jamie? Just let it out. Let it out, girl.

06:32.500 --> 06:34.500
I'm going to exorcise the burp.

06:35.500 --> 06:38.500
My burp is stuck in my esophagus.

06:39.500 --> 06:41.500
Yeah, pat her on the back like a baby.

06:42.500 --> 06:44.500
There it is! It worked!

06:44.500 --> 07:13.220
You're like a gassy baby right now.

07:13.220 --> 07:23.220
I knew you were full of hot gas, but- I cannot put that in my hair.

07:23.220 --> 07:24.220
Aha.

07:24.220 --> 07:25.220
Oh.

07:25.220 --> 07:26.220
No.

07:26.220 --> 07:28.460
B.H.G. do not give her the whip.

07:28.460 --> 07:29.460
That's bad.

07:29.460 --> 07:31.180
She doesn't need the whip.

07:31.180 --> 07:32.700
We still have more people to introduce.

07:32.700 --> 07:36.580
We have a guy here from halfway across America we haven't even said hello to yet, so let's

07:36.580 --> 07:37.580
get over here.

07:37.580 --> 07:40.380
Well, let's go around the couch here.

07:40.380 --> 07:41.380
Say hello.

07:41.380 --> 07:42.380
Hello.

07:42.380 --> 07:43.380
Hello.

07:43.380 --> 07:44.380
Hi Joey, how are you?

07:44.380 --> 07:45.380
I'm good, thank you.

07:45.380 --> 07:46.380
You're back!

07:46.380 --> 07:47.380
I'm back.

07:47.380 --> 07:50.140
Joey played his very first game of DDR today.

07:50.140 --> 07:51.140
I did.

07:51.140 --> 07:55.140
This is exciting that one year into Orange Lounge Radio we can still find DDR noobs and

07:55.140 --> 07:57.540
kind of like follow them along as they're getting into DDR.

07:57.540 --> 07:58.540
It's so cute.

07:58.540 --> 07:59.540
Oh, that was the ferret launcher.

07:59.540 --> 08:00.540
Dude, Matt built a ferret launcher.

08:00.540 --> 08:01.540
That's awesome.

08:01.540 --> 08:02.540
You missed it.

08:02.540 --> 08:03.540
Oh, he booked you?

08:03.540 --> 08:04.540
It wasn't that good anyway.

08:04.540 --> 08:05.540
You missed it.

08:05.540 --> 08:06.540
Oh, you broke the...

08:06.540 --> 08:07.540
It wasn't that good anyway.

08:07.540 --> 08:08.540
The burp of all burps.

08:08.540 --> 08:09.540
Ferret, ferret.

08:09.540 --> 08:10.540
I need the ferret.

08:10.540 --> 08:11.540
Okay.

08:11.540 --> 08:12.540
I need one.

08:12.540 --> 08:13.540
Let's see who else is here.

08:13.540 --> 08:14.540
There he is.

08:14.540 --> 08:15.540
Yeah, baby.

08:15.540 --> 08:16.540
Pass it on.

08:16.540 --> 08:17.540
And here we go.

08:17.540 --> 08:18.540
All the way from Kansas is Shane.

08:18.540 --> 08:19.540
Hi, Shane.

08:19.540 --> 08:20.540
Hi, Rob.

08:20.540 --> 08:21.540
How are you?

08:21.540 --> 08:22.540
I'm fine.

08:22.540 --> 08:23.540
I'm fine.

08:23.540 --> 08:24.540
I'm fine.

08:24.540 --> 08:25.540
I'm fine.

08:25.540 --> 08:26.540
I'm fine.

08:26.540 --> 08:27.540
I'm fine.

08:27.540 --> 08:28.540
I'm fine.

08:28.540 --> 08:29.540
I'm fine.

08:29.540 --> 08:30.540
I'm fine.

08:30.540 --> 08:31.540
I'm fine.

08:31.540 --> 08:32.540
I'm fine.

08:32.540 --> 08:33.540
I'm fine.

08:33.540 --> 08:34.980
Hi, how are you?

08:34.980 --> 08:35.580
Good.

08:35.580 --> 08:37.740
And what's your name online for people that might know you?

08:37.740 --> 08:38.240
Shane.

08:38.240 --> 08:41.420
Oh, nobody knows me online.

08:41.420 --> 08:42.020
I know you.

08:42.020 --> 08:42.820
I know you online.

08:42.820 --> 08:45.860
Oh, then it'd be Zex and Shad.

08:45.860 --> 08:47.940
Didn't you say you posted on some Kansas City boards

08:47.940 --> 08:49.140
or something?

08:49.140 --> 08:49.740
Yeah.

08:49.740 --> 08:52.180
But you posted Shane?

08:52.180 --> 08:53.500
No, I posted Mikletas.

08:53.500 --> 08:54.660
Oh, OK.

08:54.660 --> 08:56.380
Well, hello and welcome to California.

08:56.380 --> 08:56.980
Thank you.

08:56.980 --> 08:58.740
What brings you to California this week?

08:58.740 --> 09:01.260
Family business and to get away from school.

09:01.260 --> 09:01.860
Right on.

09:01.860 --> 09:02.620
Good deal.

09:02.620 --> 09:06.540
And what do you think so far of California, we're a little crazy here, huh?

09:06.540 --> 09:15.880
Just a little, the ferrets flying, and the burping.

09:15.880 --> 09:19.820
And it's nice to find Dance Summit, like, people that like it.

09:19.820 --> 09:22.320
Dance Summit was pretty cool, I've got to admit, that's what we were kind of filling

09:22.320 --> 09:24.680
in our downtime with, so that was fun.

09:24.680 --> 09:26.680
So a big hello to you, thank you for being here.

09:26.680 --> 09:27.680
Thank you.

09:27.680 --> 09:30.520
This is neat because just like, what, two weeks ago we had John Fields here all the

09:30.520 --> 09:41.040
all the way from like way back east, Connecticut, New York, all the way from Connecticut and

09:41.040 --> 09:47.440
now here we have another fan all the way from Kansas, so this is cool, I like this, and

09:47.440 --> 10:00.080
of course in the corner where the freshman belongs is, where's my fucking joke book Rob?

10:00.080 --> 10:02.600
The problem with your joke book is it's only about two pages long.

10:02.600 --> 10:03.600
I think I have it.

10:03.600 --> 10:04.600
I'm just kidding.

10:04.600 --> 10:08.640
Oh, he did not just go there.

10:08.640 --> 10:09.640
No, no.

10:09.640 --> 10:11.760
Rob, Rob, it's more than two pages long.

10:11.760 --> 10:14.520
It's five pages long in 40-point font.

10:14.520 --> 10:15.520
Ouch.

10:15.520 --> 10:22.040
I knew there was a reason you always hear from witty commentary.

10:22.040 --> 10:24.240
All right.

10:24.240 --> 10:28.960
So, whew, okay, everybody calm down for a minute.

10:28.960 --> 10:29.960
Whew.

10:29.960 --> 10:35.440
chaos in the beginning of the show here. I thought we'd kick off the show like we usually

10:35.440 --> 10:40.840
do, our all favorite game. How was your week and how was your day? I want to play this

10:40.840 --> 10:44.000
because of course we have some out of town folks here that probably have a lot that I

10:44.000 --> 10:49.000
want to say about California. And I certainly have a lot to say. So let's, I actually have

10:49.000 --> 10:55.120
the money related stories to tell this week too. No way, way. So we're going to start

10:55.120 --> 11:07.120
with Jamie. Hi. Wait, wait, hold on, hold on. I got this. Bradley gets a total zing.

11:07.120 --> 11:11.620
Arkadian42 in the chat room, he says, and 23 Magus's joke book, it's printed on recycled

11:11.620 --> 11:24.820
paper just like the material. I hate you. That was beautiful. I thought that it was

11:24.820 --> 11:31.620
recycled like, you know, like recycled toilet paper. It's written on five sheets of toilet

11:31.620 --> 11:38.820
paper. Anyway, Jamie, how was your day? How was your week? My week sucked. I worked and

11:38.820 --> 11:42.620
Dan was off in Texas.

11:42.620 --> 11:46.180
He manages an unnamed video game store.

11:49.540 --> 11:53.940
And this unnamed series of video game stores

11:53.940 --> 11:59.340
had a conference in an unnamed state named Texas.

11:59.340 --> 12:00.300
It's named now.

12:00.300 --> 12:02.260
You killed the ferret!

12:02.260 --> 12:03.260
Ferret rescued you.

12:03.260 --> 12:04.740
I killed the ferret.

12:04.740 --> 12:06.140
The ferret's supposed to be.

12:06.140 --> 12:07.420
OK.

12:07.420 --> 12:08.620
Give me the ferret.

12:08.620 --> 12:10.620
give me my baby

12:10.620 --> 12:12.620
I don't want this baby

12:12.620 --> 12:14.620
I don't want it now

12:14.620 --> 12:16.620
ok anyway

12:16.620 --> 12:18.620
anyway

12:18.620 --> 12:20.620
so I've been really

12:20.620 --> 12:22.620
like by myself all week

12:22.620 --> 12:24.620
and it sucked

12:24.620 --> 12:26.620
and I played some

12:26.620 --> 12:28.620
play some fantasy star

12:28.620 --> 12:30.620
I played some

12:30.620 --> 12:32.620
yeah my new

12:32.620 --> 12:34.620
addiction sort of is fantasy star online

12:34.620 --> 12:41.620
online. Which I'm playing on the Xbox. Because I gave up playing it on the GameCube.

12:41.620 --> 12:46.620
In response to Naoki in the chat room, yes, you must get the Skaia. Yes, you will. And

12:46.620 --> 12:53.620
it's... Oh, Jamie... Okay, what are we looking at inside? What are we looking at inside?

12:53.620 --> 12:58.620
I don't think I wonder what's in that jug. They're growing a mutant in this bottle of

12:58.620 --> 13:02.620
orange juice

13:02.620 --> 13:07.620
it expired in july and i got it in the fridge today

13:07.620 --> 13:08.620
yuck

13:08.620 --> 13:14.620
might i add i was about to pour myself a glass

13:14.620 --> 13:18.620
but penicillin is good for you, it's an anti-biotic

13:18.620 --> 13:19.620
yeah right

13:19.620 --> 13:21.620
it's rare form

13:21.620 --> 13:24.620
let me shift my position here

13:24.620 --> 13:26.620
i'm still hiding from the webcam

13:26.620 --> 13:28.900
Anyway, what is that?

13:30.340 --> 13:34.120
Anyway, all right.

13:34.920 --> 13:36.660
Richie, they do not look like maids.

13:37.360 --> 13:38.800
Get over it, please.

13:38.800 --> 13:46.900
Anyway, the Capra's look stupid now, by the way.

13:46.900 --> 13:51.880
But anyway, so I played like a whole bunch of Red Rock online

13:51.880 --> 13:54.000
and they implemented the Komodo patch,

13:54.000 --> 13:58.460
which I made it there walking with my assassin.

13:59.740 --> 14:03.720
Anyway, with the, you know,

14:03.720 --> 14:05.580
judicious use of fly wings to teleport.

14:07.100 --> 14:11.860
And I, and then I found out that with all the free wharfs it only cost me

14:11.860 --> 14:16.640
like 2,000 zenny to get there with my, to get there with my merchant.

14:16.640 --> 14:23.340
So I took my merchant there, bought 60,000 steel arrows and doubled all of my money, like,

14:23.340 --> 14:26.080
and then I started a guild named Battle Royale

14:26.080 --> 14:28.160
on my archer

14:28.160 --> 14:32.200
anyway, so yeah, my week's been like full of gaming and then full of some

14:32.200 --> 14:33.800
really stupid crappy stress

14:33.800 --> 14:37.440
and I haven't touched a single bimani game all weekend

14:37.440 --> 14:39.920
all week

14:39.920 --> 14:45.200
you know what, the past four weeks we've done this segment you haven't touched a bimani game

14:45.200 --> 14:50.200
I am next week. Max 2 is coming out this week, do you plan on playing it? I'm gonna play it

14:50.200 --> 14:56.000
I've still got the interestingly acquired

14:56.000 --> 14:58.920
dance pad at my house.

14:58.920 --> 15:01.520
You mean my dance pad?

15:01.520 --> 15:02.920
It's been at my house for 30 days.

15:02.920 --> 15:04.280
Hey, watch it, lady.

15:04.280 --> 15:06.920
I don't like where you're going with that.

15:06.920 --> 15:07.920
I'm kidding.

15:07.920 --> 15:11.000
It's not paying rent either, so evict it already.

15:11.000 --> 15:11.920
I'm kidding.

15:11.920 --> 15:14.280
You know I give it back when you ask for it.

15:14.280 --> 15:18.360
Provided we don't break up, because that's

15:18.360 --> 15:25.320
I got it in the first place and and then I found out that I'm 69% male on my

15:25.320 --> 15:43.920
lateral which is funny excuse me but I have balls to scratch thank you for

15:43.920 --> 15:45.540
of those in your magazine said, I thought

15:45.540 --> 15:47.740
they were on the upper body.

15:47.740 --> 15:48.640
Flying ferret.

15:52.640 --> 15:54.980
This thing hurts, by the way, when you hit people with it.

15:54.980 --> 16:00.500
My, my, I found out that this thing

16:00.500 --> 16:03.780
that I have my hair wrapped up in hurts really hard

16:03.780 --> 16:05.440
if you get wrapped with it.

16:05.440 --> 16:06.920
What about the whip?

16:06.920 --> 16:08.440
Whips hurt too, but this hurts more.

16:08.440 --> 16:09.940
Oh, OK.

16:09.940 --> 16:27.860
Anyway, I downloaded a bunch of crap from my computer, and she's also the most wonderful

16:27.860 --> 16:33.860
sister in the world because she's working on dark sakura.com and by the way we did some

16:33.860 --> 16:41.660
work for roleplay.dark sakura.com which should be a few more forms have been added on so

16:41.660 --> 16:49.060
everybody has to sign up for it now and then that's it so that was your day in your week

16:49.060 --> 16:56.020
and came home today and you might be leaving early tonight maybe because it might you might

16:56.020 --> 17:01.180
have to you know plan for a long evening home tonight and we're gonna go get food

17:01.180 --> 17:07.100
but I ate I had a salad and blue potato chips which I'm going to share with

17:07.100 --> 17:12.060
everyone yum blue did it taste like blue it tastes like blue amazingly enough

17:12.060 --> 17:21.100
awesome it tastes very rugged like blue just a reminder you guys I'm the chat

17:21.100 --> 17:24.820
room is kind of bitching about things going up and down we're doing the best

17:24.820 --> 17:29.660
we can address those cards and letters to Comcast, DDRcaholic in the chat room says

17:29.660 --> 17:33.540
Comcast is so friggin' unreliable, it should be illegal to run a business the way they

17:33.540 --> 17:36.740
do and I tend to agree, it's pretty sad.

17:36.740 --> 17:38.540
It's even worse than Scandia's business.

17:38.540 --> 17:42.380
It's worse than Roseville Golf Land.

17:42.380 --> 17:43.380
And getting down to Scandia's.

17:43.380 --> 17:47.020
It's a moment of silence like, I can't believe you just went there.

17:47.020 --> 17:52.420
Hey, I worked at Arcades, I know what's going on.

17:52.420 --> 18:13.260
How was your week, how was your day?

18:13.260 --> 18:17.220
This week was expensive, it involved buying things.

18:17.220 --> 18:22.220
There's a lot of wood outside.

18:22.220 --> 18:26.220
Loki bought some stiff wood.

18:26.220 --> 18:32.220
Yes, I bought eight nice sheets of MDF for the arcade cabinet.

18:32.220 --> 18:35.220
I'm working on finishing my pads. I'm almost done.

18:35.220 --> 18:38.220
I've got one of them almost done.

18:38.220 --> 18:45.220
I'm starting the wiring on it, but I haven't gotten around to it.

18:45.220 --> 18:47.580
But anyway, starting the wiring on one of the pads,

18:47.580 --> 18:51.420
the other pad needs to be done, probably be done this week.

18:51.420 --> 18:55.780
Arcade stuff, I'm getting the rest of my buttons pretty soon.

18:55.780 --> 18:58.220
I ordered an Atari 2600 track ball

18:58.220 --> 19:01.780
that's going to be hacked into turntables for 2DX.

19:01.780 --> 19:04.100
So you're turning an Atari 2600 track ball

19:04.100 --> 19:05.660
into a 2DX controller?

19:05.660 --> 19:08.260
No, the optical controls for it are

19:08.260 --> 19:12.020
going to be for the turntables for 2DX.

19:12.020 --> 19:17.420
But then, I have these two spinners here, I realize they're pretty useless now.

19:18.700 --> 19:21.840
Yeah. Because I can't use them, duh.

19:22.560 --> 19:25.420
It's because it's a B movie.

19:26.220 --> 19:32.180
But anyways, so I bought a bunch of shit, and I spent a lot of money,

19:32.180 --> 19:34.620
and now I have to scrimp for like a few weeks.

19:34.620 --> 19:37.300
And then, what else did I do?

19:37.300 --> 19:48.180
I can't even see the screen. It's for the best, Loki, don't worry about it. It's for

19:48.180 --> 19:54.220
the best. Our chat room, our chat room is bitchy tonight. Man, you take, you rob them

19:54.220 --> 20:01.060
of 20 minutes of orange lounge and just go freaking claws out. I think Loki's kicking

20:01.060 --> 20:08.060
someone from the chat room. And of course she's under my name. Hey, be nice! That was

20:11.540 --> 20:17.820
under me! You did that under my name! Rob, that's so mean! Why did you do that? I didn't

20:17.820 --> 20:24.820
do it, and Jamie knows it, and she's my witness. I did not do it! I didn't do it! Rob! I said

20:24.820 --> 20:38.620
I'm sorry I'm gonna kick him where's my foot that's pretty bad if you smell the

20:38.620 --> 20:44.380
shoe mine smells worse okay so what else did I do this week

20:44.380 --> 20:47.780
Will somebody, will somebody invite her back, please?

20:49.880 --> 20:51.180
Anyway, go ahead.

20:51.180 --> 20:56.220
Yeah. So, what else?

20:56.220 --> 20:58.340
I don't know, I didn't do too much this week.

20:58.340 --> 21:01.180
It's pretty much just working on the stupid pads and then, you know,

21:01.180 --> 21:03.440
just sitting at my desk, rotting away.

21:03.440 --> 21:08.360
And at one point I was trying to, I didn't know how I was going to hook up the pads to, like, the.

21:08.360 --> 21:27.440
I know I'm hilarious okay if you're not in our chat room tonight you're missing

21:27.440 --> 21:34.240
out I'm sorry I'm sorry that was so one-sided the chat room is so bitchy

21:34.240 --> 21:41.880
she tonight, it's beautiful. You must be there. www.callybemani.com. Click on Orange

21:41.880 --> 21:58.040
Lounge and click on chat. Yeah, anyways, so... Moving on. Yes. Yeah, that's pretty much my

21:58.040 --> 22:06.080
week yeah just a lot of nothing oh and I found a lot of rotted stuff in our

22:06.080 --> 22:16.960
fridge which I cleaned out not that huh yeah hmm that's it I'm done all right

22:16.960 --> 22:22.560
but then again you know if Marin wants me to I can keep talking all night long I can

22:22.560 --> 22:31.480
never said. I'll talk about my week and my day. My week was, there wasn't really a lot

22:31.480 --> 22:37.080
to it, work, sleep, play, you know, type thing, whatever. There was that and then, but this

22:37.080 --> 22:44.200
weekend, this was cool. Yesterday, yesterday I went to Reno. Well, Reno is kind of a shit

22:44.200 --> 22:50.320
hole in some ways but, you know, I got to gamble which is fun because I love gambling.

22:50.320 --> 23:07.720
I lost $100 yesterday gambling, which is kind of sad in a way, but I had lost $120, and

23:07.720 --> 23:13.240
I made $20 back on video poker, so that's good, but I lost $60 in a slot machine trying

23:13.240 --> 23:15.240
to win a Lexus.

23:15.240 --> 23:17.040
I really, really wanted it.

23:17.040 --> 23:19.360
That was real wise.

23:19.360 --> 23:22.840
And not only do we gamble, we went around and played some different DDR machines, because

23:22.840 --> 23:27.000
you know, in a town like Vegas or Reno, every casino's got a DDR machine, right?

23:27.000 --> 23:31.560
So we went to the El Dorado, and they have, get this, a Solo 4th Plus.

23:31.560 --> 23:33.920
Those are so rare.

23:33.920 --> 23:34.920
It was godly.

23:34.920 --> 23:36.520
I was so happy to play it.

23:36.520 --> 23:42.920
I mean, like, how often do you see a 4th Plus these days, let alone a Solo 4th Plus I could

23:42.920 --> 23:43.920
play?

23:43.920 --> 23:48.880
And you know, you know, I fired that fucker up and I played Solo Conga Feelin', first

23:48.880 --> 23:52.880
6 panel conga feelin. It's awesome.

23:52.880 --> 23:56.880
And I did some freestyle too. That was fun. I went with the Ice Princess.

23:56.880 --> 24:00.880
I did some lead freestyle too.

24:00.880 --> 24:04.880
Aaron too just perked up when you said that.

24:04.880 --> 24:08.880
I did some great freestyle. I did a freestyle to the 7th jump.

24:08.880 --> 24:12.880
I did a freestyle to the 7th jump. It ruled.

24:12.880 --> 24:16.880
You don't know the 7th.

24:46.880 --> 24:51.880
I feel the need to spread my sky germs everywhere.

24:51.880 --> 24:52.880
Oh, heaven forbid.

24:52.880 --> 24:53.880
So, anyway.

24:53.880 --> 24:54.880
I humped that machine.

24:54.880 --> 24:57.880
That was pretty much my week of my day in a nutshell.

24:57.880 --> 24:59.880
Yeah, I am.

24:59.880 --> 25:02.880
So, if EvilMalkey2DX says he humped that machine.

25:02.880 --> 25:03.880
So, I humped it too.

25:03.880 --> 25:05.880
So, we kind of had sex.

25:05.880 --> 25:10.880
I hope you wore a condom.

25:10.880 --> 25:12.880
Oh, boy.

25:12.880 --> 25:15.600
I did, I danced to Oh Nick, please don't so quick too,

25:15.600 --> 25:20.380
because to play six panel erotic is just beautiful.

25:20.960 --> 25:23.740
Moving on.

25:24.000 --> 25:27.360
What was that number two in your five toilet paper sheet joke book?

25:27.880 --> 25:31.800
Puppy. How was your day, how was your week?

25:32.760 --> 25:39.780
Okay, this week has been stuff on campus, looking for a job, and just got,

25:39.780 --> 25:43.780
kostjamrh And more Disgaea, and more Disgaea, and more Disgaea.

25:43.780 --> 25:46.780
Q. Did you do the past week's prize Disgaea?

25:46.780 --> 25:50.780
A. No, I really don't remember anything I did the past week besides play Disgaea.

25:50.780 --> 25:55.780
That's kinda sad, but it's time well spent.

25:55.780 --> 25:57.780
Q. You took a picture of my ass in the screenshot.

25:57.780 --> 26:00.780
A. That's a really good picture.

26:00.780 --> 26:05.780
And then there's that fuck out column on the microphone.

26:05.780 --> 26:14.780
A game has to be good when you hear some really disturbing jokes about a zombie and a horse

26:14.780 --> 26:15.780
wiener.

26:15.780 --> 26:21.140
Is this something out of Magus's joke book?

26:21.140 --> 26:22.140
What?

26:22.140 --> 26:23.140
No.

26:23.140 --> 26:24.140
Oh.

26:24.140 --> 26:25.140
No, I'm serious.

26:25.140 --> 26:26.140
It's actually part of the plot of the game.

26:26.140 --> 26:28.660
Why is my ass still on the webcam?

26:28.660 --> 26:31.580
Your ass is still on the webcam because it hasn't refreshed you.

26:31.580 --> 26:38.580
checking you out

26:39.260 --> 26:40.860
uh...

26:40.860 --> 26:42.280
and then

26:42.280 --> 26:43.740
yeah i would like

26:43.740 --> 26:45.240
besides the fact that i am

26:45.240 --> 26:48.240
now settled into my apartment

26:48.240 --> 26:49.860
uh...

26:49.860 --> 26:51.000
for

26:51.000 --> 26:53.860
people are you know i think that

26:53.860 --> 26:58.660
something in the area comcast as a to you

26:58.660 --> 27:01.820
tag teaming I feel like I'm in kindergarten again

27:01.820 --> 27:05.660
okay now we just need some whoopee cushions and we'll be set

27:05.660 --> 27:09.100
I was gonna say I kinda have to fart kidding kidding

27:09.100 --> 27:13.900
kidding kidding no I have a

27:13.900 --> 27:17.980
I have a um what do you call it cigarette lighter somewhere though

27:17.980 --> 27:21.540
alright that was it

27:21.540 --> 27:25.980
alright uh Joey do you have anything you want to share about your week and your day

27:25.980 --> 27:38.620
p0k3smot42o my week was filled with work, and work, and more work, but it pays the bills.

27:38.620 --> 27:47.500
This weekend I was off, didn't do a whole lot, just hung out, and today I played my

27:47.500 --> 27:58.420
first game of DDR, very first time, and what was it? I passed a three-step.

27:58.420 --> 28:02.940
Yes, you passed a three-footer. That's the DDR lingo, a three-footer.

28:02.940 --> 28:08.900
I passed it. That was so cool. First try. Anyway, other than that, that was it.

28:08.900 --> 28:15.900
it

28:17.020 --> 28:19.820
uh... was it

28:19.820 --> 28:23.220
look into the sky?

28:23.220 --> 28:25.840
Good job!

28:25.840 --> 28:32.840
Chaos, this isn't Channel DDR Freak, mom jokes are not welcome here!

28:32.840 --> 28:41.840
Anyway, our chair room is so feisty tonight. What a bunch of bitches.

28:41.840 --> 28:51.840
Anyway, let's move on. Andrew, Mr. Magus, tell us about your week and your day.

28:51.840 --> 28:59.840
My week was full of bombing Japanese quizzes and putting it on locks at the ARC arcade.

28:59.840 --> 29:19.400
I've been studying, Jamie, and I've been working with a student association at ARC, trying

29:19.400 --> 29:21.280
to get some machines worked on.

29:21.280 --> 29:25.660
They're checking out the Beachhead 2000, trying to get there a place for something Bahmani.

29:55.660 --> 30:01.740
I can concur with that, actually.

30:01.740 --> 30:05.740
And now, if you noticed, I saved our two guests for last, and one's on the phone right now.

30:05.740 --> 30:09.380
He must be on a booty call, so we'll talk to Aaron.

30:09.380 --> 30:12.660
Never mind, this is Dad.

30:12.660 --> 30:20.420
What was that joke he told at dinner, something about we were making fun of him for being

30:20.420 --> 30:23.820
on the phone with his uncle, or something, we joked about it being a booty call, and

30:23.820 --> 30:27.740
He said, no, it's my uncle, and he's not even cute.

30:27.740 --> 30:30.260
It's great.

30:30.260 --> 30:30.940
Shane's a riot.

30:30.940 --> 30:32.480
We'll hear from him in a little bit.

30:32.480 --> 30:34.700
Let's hear from Erin, Biden hyper girl.

30:34.700 --> 30:37.180
How was your week and how was your day?

30:37.180 --> 30:40.940
Well, my week was full of planning for a friend,

30:40.940 --> 30:43.460
planning a birthday party for a friend, a surprise birthday

30:43.460 --> 30:45.820
party, which, by the way, when we surprised her,

30:45.820 --> 30:49.220
I've never seen her turn more red until that day.

30:49.220 --> 30:50.460
And she started crying, too.

30:50.460 --> 30:53.620
So it was a really good party, and I slept over.

30:53.620 --> 30:59.660
So I am running on about three hours of sleep, a sip of DNL,

30:59.660 --> 31:02.660
some water, some orange juice, huh?

31:02.660 --> 31:03.740
Don't forget the penguin mints.

31:03.740 --> 31:04.940
Yeah, the penguin mints.

31:04.940 --> 31:08.180
And I don't know what else I'm running on.

31:08.180 --> 31:11.060
Hi, and welcome to college.

31:11.060 --> 31:13.300
Yeah, I feel vaguely hungry right now,

31:13.300 --> 31:14.420
but it hasn't hit me yet.

31:14.420 --> 31:15.300
I'm hungry.

31:15.300 --> 31:16.340
Give me the blue cheese.

31:16.340 --> 31:17.460
Let's get the blue cheese.

31:17.460 --> 31:17.960
No!

31:20.420 --> 31:21.540
But yeah.

31:21.540 --> 31:27.020
and um... by the way my apartment has two vents

31:27.020 --> 31:30.020
for those of you that don't know

31:30.020 --> 31:33.740
i'm currently in davis right now and i will be here for the rest of the year

31:33.740 --> 31:36.260
haha

31:36.260 --> 31:41.400
my apartment has two vents none of which are in any of the bedrooms

31:41.400 --> 31:43.460
my toilet leaks

31:43.460 --> 31:44.760
there's a big

31:44.760 --> 31:46.580
water stain

31:46.580 --> 31:49.740
there's a water stain on my ceiling

31:49.740 --> 31:53.800
we have no internet we won't have any internet for the next two days

31:53.800 --> 31:56.600
and yay no internet

31:56.600 --> 31:57.500
we don't

31:57.500 --> 31:59.720
i don't think we have comcast

31:59.720 --> 32:03.500
you're getting dsl right that's not comcast

32:03.500 --> 32:06.640
yeah i don't think it's comcast it's blue they're passing around blue chips

32:06.640 --> 32:10.640
so shot shane's like

32:10.640 --> 32:14.480
you want me to talk to him?

32:14.480 --> 32:17.560
so he wants to finish his chip i'll give him a second

32:17.560 --> 32:22.480
So, and now my weekend will be winding down with spending time with this crazy, insane,

32:22.480 --> 32:27.500
perverted Orange Lounge crew, which I love so very, very much.

32:27.500 --> 32:30.740
And yes, it is true, I do have my whip.

32:30.740 --> 32:35.120
So there will be a lot of mass bondage orgy tonight.

32:35.120 --> 32:36.120
What?

32:36.120 --> 32:40.980
I heard orgy.

32:40.980 --> 32:41.980
Oh, crap.

32:41.980 --> 32:42.980
Here.

32:42.980 --> 32:43.980
All right.

32:43.980 --> 32:45.980
Not just any orgy, Logie.

32:45.980 --> 32:46.980
Ass bondage.

32:46.980 --> 32:47.980
That's a mass.

32:47.980 --> 32:48.980
Orgy.

32:48.980 --> 32:49.980
Oh, mass?

32:49.980 --> 32:51.740
Oh, I thought she said ass bondage.

32:51.740 --> 32:52.740
Mass bonded orgy.

32:52.740 --> 32:53.980
I was like, is that like leather panties?

32:53.980 --> 32:55.980
Hey, that's going to make fun.

32:55.980 --> 32:56.980
Except for the ass part.

32:56.980 --> 33:00.980
Ass bondage is super glue.

33:00.980 --> 33:03.180
Right.

33:03.180 --> 33:05.140
Mass orgy sounds great.

33:05.140 --> 33:06.140
I'm down.

33:06.140 --> 33:07.140
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

33:07.140 --> 33:09.900
This is a side of Logie I've never seen before.

33:09.900 --> 33:20.940
orgy I've never seen him just propose a mass orgy like this sorry anyway let's

33:20.940 --> 33:23.940
talk to Shane I'm not sure you was proposing I think he was just agreeing

33:23.940 --> 33:29.180
with it I went in order of distance here so Shane has to be last I'm just kidding

33:29.180 --> 33:36.540
so how you doing I'm good my week sucked because we drove a hundred or one

33:36.540 --> 33:39.380
One thousand six hundred and ninety miles from Kansas to get here.

33:39.380 --> 33:40.380
You counted.

33:40.380 --> 33:41.380
No.

33:41.380 --> 33:42.380
Yeah.

33:42.380 --> 33:49.140
Well, you don't have much else to do on the road.

33:49.140 --> 33:50.140
You had to drive through Nevada.

33:50.140 --> 33:51.140
Yeah.

33:51.140 --> 33:54.100
Oh, and I have a serious F.U. to Elko later.

33:54.100 --> 33:55.100
Oh my God.

33:55.100 --> 33:56.100
Okay.

33:56.100 --> 33:57.100
But, yeah.

33:57.100 --> 34:02.360
Two days of driving, eh, family, eh, Scandia.

34:02.360 --> 34:03.360
Had 2DX.

34:03.360 --> 34:04.360
That was pretty good.

34:04.360 --> 34:07.880
um... got a double A on Dancer, yay!

34:07.880 --> 34:10.480
uh... died on Yoru no Sunglass, ooh again

34:10.480 --> 34:11.860
errrrrrrr

34:11.860 --> 34:13.980
and uh... yeah

34:13.980 --> 34:16.460
just relaxing, taking time off school

34:16.460 --> 34:18.900
any other interesting things you've seen in Sacramento while you've been here?

34:18.900 --> 34:20.580
um...

34:20.580 --> 34:22.340
let's see

34:22.340 --> 34:27.280
no, no, really, it's been pretty good. Oh, I know, what did you have for the first time today? Oh, Mongolian Barbecue

34:27.280 --> 34:29.580
that was awesome

34:29.580 --> 34:35.020
I burnt my tongue and it still hurts, but it was good.

34:35.020 --> 34:39.380
We took them to one of the Mongolians that isn't even like one of the really good ones

34:39.380 --> 34:40.380
we always go to.

34:40.380 --> 34:42.640
We took them to that one we used to go to by my old house.

34:42.640 --> 34:45.340
It's just called the Mongolian barbecue behind Wasabi.

34:45.340 --> 34:48.740
It's okay, but it's not even the best one.

34:48.740 --> 34:55.980
Well, you can't have Mongolian barbecue now, they're all closed.

34:55.980 --> 35:04.340
I never had Korean barbeque.

35:04.340 --> 35:07.100
So what else are you going to do on your trip?

35:07.100 --> 35:10.380
I just got my San Francisco trip cancelled, which is fine.

35:10.380 --> 35:11.380
What?

35:11.380 --> 35:16.340
Dad doesn't want to drive anymore, so that's okay.

35:16.340 --> 35:18.340
You get to hang with us more!

35:18.340 --> 35:19.340
Oh no.

35:19.340 --> 35:24.340
You can come over for vanilla sky tomorrow night.

35:24.340 --> 35:25.340
My spinoff show.

35:25.340 --> 35:27.340
I'm so glad you asked, Erin!

35:28.340 --> 35:34.340
Vanilla Sky airs on Orange Lounge Radio every Monday night at 7 o'clock, provided we have a fucking internet connection tomorrow.

35:34.340 --> 35:36.340
And on Tuesday nights...

35:37.340 --> 35:38.340
Come on, gimme!

35:38.340 --> 35:40.340
God damn it, I'm eating my chips.

35:42.340 --> 35:44.340
Tuesday night is pump up the volume.

35:44.340 --> 35:46.340
With me.

35:46.340 --> 35:48.340
Please show it at 7 o'clock, show it at 7.30.

35:48.340 --> 35:50.340
To 10.30.

35:50.340 --> 35:52.340
No, you can't have any more of my chips.

35:53.340 --> 35:54.340
Oh.

35:54.340 --> 36:06.260
there's something stuck in here oh no there's something um anyway um but it's

36:06.260 --> 36:11.020
a just an hour and a half I'm sorry three hours of lots of crap that I

36:11.020 --> 36:14.460
decided to play but in a chat room you can request something and if I have it

36:14.460 --> 36:19.420
I'll play it and if it sucks I'll laugh at you and then I talk about killing

36:19.420 --> 36:34.100
people often okay oh hi there's a mic right here um what do I talk about my

36:34.100 --> 36:37.780
show um first of all Rob I don't have much of a reason to because my internet

36:37.780 --> 36:43.260
was only out for five minutes and I wasn't even there when it happened the

36:43.260 --> 36:46.780
only thing that obsessed me about that is I was vending at the time and you're

36:46.780 --> 36:53.180
Yeah, so now your your vending is gone and your pre-show got pretty much axed unfortunately, but now you don't have to do

36:54.940 --> 36:56.940
I

36:57.620 --> 37:01.580
Was gonna say oh my show Aaron asked what I talked about on my show I talked about

37:02.700 --> 37:08.900
We talked about like news stories sometimes and then we sometimes get into like other games like we talked about puzzle pirates a little bit

37:08.980 --> 37:12.120
Talk about Ragnarok we talked about console games. I

37:12.780 --> 37:14.100
saw

37:14.100 --> 37:16.700
So now you even have more reason to join dark secularist forums

37:17.220 --> 37:19.220
and

37:19.220 --> 37:26.560
Just general crap. We have a little bit. So we do every week. We do a video video game trivia to bad music and we do

37:27.100 --> 37:29.840
Guess the yahoo talkback because people on Yahoo are idiots

37:31.260 --> 37:37.160
So tune in and see for yourself. Sorry. I just want to answer the question anything else you wanna say about your show Jamie on Tuesdays

37:37.160 --> 37:48.160
I'm going to try to do video game music trivia, like actually where you play music and people guess, for an hour on my show.

37:48.160 --> 37:53.160
So let's see if anyone can dethrone Darktitsia so that...

37:53.160 --> 37:58.160
Huh? They can't hear what you're saying.

37:58.160 --> 38:02.160
Can he do it in the last hour of the show so he can do it?

38:02.160 --> 38:04.160
I'll see you when I'll start it. You just gotta be there.

38:04.160 --> 38:04.660
Yeah.

38:04.660 --> 38:05.160
All right.

38:07.160 --> 38:07.660
Next.

38:09.660 --> 38:10.160
Hold on.

38:10.160 --> 38:12.160
Actually, I was just going to say Wednesday night to go chronologically.

38:12.160 --> 38:17.160
This Wednesday is going to be our DDR Max 2 show, and we're just going to...

38:17.660 --> 38:21.660
We're still not sure if Max 2 is actually going to hit Tuesday or Wednesday.

38:22.160 --> 38:26.160
Some of you guys might get it Tuesday, but we're not going to bank on it, and Jamie has her show anyway,

38:26.160 --> 38:28.660
so we're just going to hold off on Wednesday for sure.

38:28.660 --> 38:30.160
We will have Max 2.

38:30.160 --> 38:34.120
unless we don't get it wednesday either well then we're going to burn down the place you

38:34.120 --> 38:41.760
pre-ordered it from which is a game stop but it's not the game stop it's a game stop

38:41.760 --> 38:49.340
so um so it's okay if we burn it um but uh wednesday we'll be playing max 2 live on air

38:49.340 --> 38:52.840
so for those of you that can't get it right now because of money issues or whatever you

38:52.840 --> 38:56.360
can play it vicariously through us that's the whole idea and don't worry you'll lose

38:56.360 --> 39:00.580
interest just as fast as we will. Yes, and then you won't even want to buy it. But with

39:00.580 --> 39:04.000
DDR Max we actually did this and it was somewhat more successful than we thought. I just, I

39:04.000 --> 39:07.700
remember when I got Max I went live with it. A lot of you really liked tuning in and listening

39:07.700 --> 39:12.040
to it, so I had the webcam going and everything, so tune in for that this Wednesday. And then

39:12.040 --> 39:17.020
next Wednesday, if it works out, what? Well, I was going to say that the first time we

39:17.020 --> 39:22.700
did that with Max, you kind of didn't have it very well set up. Yeah, it was kind of

39:22.700 --> 39:24.860
a shitty set up, but it's going to be much, you can already tell it's going to be much

39:24.860 --> 39:33.660
much better this time because we have Loki's toys. Next Wednesday, it's not, the T's aren't

39:33.660 --> 39:37.660
crossed and the I's aren't dotted, but we're hoping that we're going to be teaming up with

39:37.660 --> 39:43.100
another website to bring you some exclusive programming. That's all I can say. Some very

39:43.100 --> 39:46.340
interesting debut programming next Wednesday, just a one-off show.

39:46.340 --> 39:48.060
I don't care about, but whatever.

39:48.060 --> 39:49.060
I go, whoo!

39:49.060 --> 39:54.340
Don't sound too excited. It's going to be big though. For a lot of you, you guys are

39:54.340 --> 40:02.340
going to be all woke. Yeah, you freaking losers. Anyway, Loki. I haven't been there like in

40:02.340 --> 40:07.460
a long time. Why are you giving this to me? Here. What are you doing? You freaking nut.

40:07.460 --> 40:16.740
I was supposed to talk about my show. My show is called Mass Bondage Orgy. It's every Thursday

40:16.740 --> 40:20.900
we have a mass bondage orgy in the middle of the room. We kind of move the table over

40:20.900 --> 40:26.300
cuz it you know it's kind of in the way but I bet that pretty much explains the

40:26.300 --> 40:34.540
stains on the ground but um yeah so mass bonded Georgie every Thursday at 7

40:34.540 --> 40:40.940
o'clock are you seriously changing the name I bet more people would tune in you

40:40.940 --> 40:46.660
know pretty funny Loki Loki's been having I feel bad because like people

40:46.660 --> 40:50.540
tune in to listen to my train wreck of a show and Jamie gets Jamie gets some

40:50.540 --> 40:54.060
pretty good listenership on her show, but for some reason you guys are not tuning in

40:54.060 --> 40:58.900
on Thursdays. Hey, guess what you guys? Friends sucks. Don't watch Friends. Listen to Loki's

40:58.900 --> 40:59.900
show.

40:59.900 --> 41:03.540
Well, if you know, the same amount of people keep tuning in constantly, I guess I'm going

41:03.540 --> 41:10.460
to have to stop doing my show and take a day off, you know?

41:10.460 --> 41:11.460
What?

41:11.460 --> 41:12.460
What?

41:12.460 --> 41:13.460
Do we need to borrow a TV? We have an extra.

41:13.460 --> 41:18.860
We'll see what we can do. We'll see what we can do.

41:18.860 --> 41:23.860
I'm going to sell mine for cheap.

41:23.860 --> 41:27.380
I have a nice 19-inch TV, pretty much like new.

41:27.380 --> 41:28.860
I just upgraded to a 25.

41:28.860 --> 41:30.780
Anyway, this is why no one tunes in Loki.

41:30.780 --> 41:33.260
Talk about Livewire.

41:33.260 --> 41:34.980
Livewire, it's my mixing show.

41:34.980 --> 41:37.580
It's been going on for like seven weeks now except for one

41:37.580 --> 41:39.820
week where I didn't do it because it was my birthday.

41:39.820 --> 41:43.380
And then, yeah, so we did last week was

41:43.380 --> 41:44.860
Bamani remixed music.

41:44.860 --> 41:47.700
And we play a lot of like erotic trance stuff and then a

41:47.700 --> 41:56.460
a lot of just remix stuff, like from 2DX and DDR and that kind of crap. And then, you know,

41:56.460 --> 42:00.980
you guys were, you know, treated to a very nice set, you know, all four of you that turned,

42:00.980 --> 42:06.380
tuned in. And actually, you know what, it was a good set of music. It was some good

42:06.380 --> 42:08.880
stuff. And you had some stuff in there we never heard before, like you had the long

42:08.880 --> 42:15.380
version of that Drifting Away mix. That was cool. Yeah. Pretty much, yeah, my show I give

42:45.380 --> 42:48.140
it's a it's a sweet time

42:48.140 --> 42:49.860
yeah

42:49.860 --> 42:50.660
i know

42:50.660 --> 42:54.460
you have like a shot of flash version of gal panic

42:54.460 --> 42:56.420
that only is up during the show

42:56.420 --> 42:57.380
if you're tuned in

42:57.380 --> 42:58.220
well

42:58.220 --> 43:00.380
uh... no

43:00.380 --> 43:01.100
there you go

43:01.100 --> 43:04.980
marin says the best damn remix show ever

43:04.980 --> 43:05.860
i like

43:05.860 --> 43:10.680
it is the best damn life of money remixing show on my three sixty five we

43:10.680 --> 43:12.680
We know this for a fact.

43:12.680 --> 43:14.680
Yeah.

43:14.680 --> 43:16.680
Yes, all one of them.

43:16.680 --> 43:18.680
Loser.

43:18.680 --> 43:20.680
Friggin' A, yeah.

43:20.680 --> 43:22.680
So, it's my show.

43:22.680 --> 43:24.680
I try to have it prepared before, you know,

43:24.680 --> 43:26.680
I go live.

43:26.680 --> 43:28.680
Sometimes I do, sometimes I don't.

43:28.680 --> 43:30.680
Like, this week I just kind of pulled it together

43:30.680 --> 43:32.680
five minutes after the show started, so.

43:32.680 --> 43:34.680
Is this the out of the act guy?

43:34.680 --> 43:36.680
Yeah, they all are.

43:36.680 --> 43:38.680
Now, if I'm not mistaking,

43:38.680 --> 43:41.680
Don't we have a new Loki remix we're debuting tonight?

43:41.680 --> 43:42.680
Yeah.

43:42.680 --> 43:43.680
Ah!

43:43.680 --> 43:49.520
We'll do that towards the end of the show because, um, because, yeah, speaking of pulled

43:49.520 --> 44:00.780
out the ass, yeah, that remix was, that remix was probably the second least, yeah, probably

44:00.780 --> 44:06.120
the second from the bottom for the least effort put into a remix, but it's pretty cool.

44:06.120 --> 44:09.120
I have banned that guy 5 times on VDR.

44:09.120 --> 44:11.120
What? No stylings?

44:11.120 --> 44:13.120
JB Horne.

44:13.120 --> 44:15.120
Are you done horning out Live Wire?

44:15.120 --> 44:18.120
Yeah, speaking of whores, plenty of whores on Live Wire.

44:18.120 --> 44:22.120
Lots of whores and mass bondage.

44:22.120 --> 44:25.120
In fact, we're just gonna play like pornos.

44:25.120 --> 44:28.120
Hey, do you want me to loan you my whip?

44:28.120 --> 44:29.120
Nah, that's alright.

44:29.120 --> 44:30.120
Are you sure?

44:30.120 --> 44:33.120
He has his own collection in the closet.

44:33.120 --> 44:36.120
Just have handcuffs.

44:36.120 --> 44:39.120
And those are the lame handcuffs, too.

44:39.120 --> 44:40.120
Are they fuzzy handcuffs?

44:40.120 --> 44:48.120
No, they're plastic handcuffs I got with the Lupin kit.

44:48.120 --> 44:49.120
No one missed it.

44:49.120 --> 44:51.120
I got it. This is great.

44:51.120 --> 44:55.120
Anyway, we kind of cut Shane off.

44:55.120 --> 45:00.120
I feel bad because Aaron gave us a chance to openly whore out our shows and we just jumped all over it.

45:00.120 --> 45:06.160
were like, screw the guy who came out here 1,700 miles.

45:06.160 --> 45:07.800
I think that we just hopped on that one

45:07.800 --> 45:10.440
and dry-humped that segment.

45:10.440 --> 45:12.360
Plenty of dry-humping on Live Wire.

45:15.560 --> 45:18.040
We apologize for dry-humping your monologue.

45:18.040 --> 45:20.560
You may now continue.

45:20.560 --> 45:23.480
OK, dry-humping the monologue, sex with my dad,

45:23.480 --> 45:25.880
sex with my uncle, God.

45:25.880 --> 45:27.360
Although you can't decide.

45:27.360 --> 45:34.360
I didn't really have anything else to say except for it's awesome here and I miss it

45:34.360 --> 45:41.360
I didn't really have anything else to say except for it's awesome here and I miss it

45:42.760 --> 45:47.760
a lot. Anybody else have anything to say, Rob?

45:47.760 --> 45:54.600
Is somebody trying to ban No Styling? No, I'm copying his quote, so don't ban him. We

45:54.600 --> 45:56.600
need comic books. I'm not banning him, you retort!

45:56.600 --> 46:01.600
Will somebody just... We need to keep our eyes on him. We're alive.

46:01.600 --> 46:30.840
We're going to do the FUs of the week right now.

46:30.840 --> 46:33.840
But then we're going to go like half the show out of breaks.

46:34.840 --> 46:36.840
Do you have to pee that bad?

46:36.840 --> 46:37.840
No.

46:37.840 --> 46:39.840
Okay, who has to pee in here?

46:39.840 --> 46:42.840
Okay, we're doing the fuckies of the week.

46:44.840 --> 46:45.840
It's a little warm.

46:45.840 --> 46:47.840
I went before we left.

46:47.840 --> 46:48.840
Are we there yet?

46:48.840 --> 46:49.840
No.

46:49.840 --> 46:50.840
Are we there yet?

46:50.840 --> 46:51.840
No.

46:51.840 --> 46:52.840
Are we there yet?

46:52.840 --> 46:53.840
No.

46:53.840 --> 46:54.840
Are we there yet?

46:54.840 --> 46:55.840
Shut up.

46:55.840 --> 46:56.840
Are we there yet?

46:56.840 --> 46:57.840
Bang!

46:57.840 --> 46:59.840
Oh wait, I lost the link for our forums.

46:59.840 --> 47:05.440
Where are our forums Rob? www.calibomani.com

47:05.440 --> 47:08.440
Click on forums.

47:08.440 --> 47:13.440
In the corner, move the camera.

47:13.440 --> 47:19.440
No, not on me.

47:19.440 --> 47:21.440
Okay, let's...

47:21.440 --> 47:25.440
So everybody, send Rob, flood Rob with private messages

47:25.440 --> 47:27.440
with everything that pisses you off.

47:27.440 --> 47:28.440
Alright, sounds good to me.

47:28.440 --> 47:30.440
And then ping him.

47:30.440 --> 47:34.440
God, our connection sucks enough thanks to Comcast.

47:34.440 --> 47:39.440
And then everyone, ping No Stylin.

47:39.440 --> 47:40.440
At once.

47:40.440 --> 47:41.440
Don't ping No Stylin.

47:41.440 --> 47:46.440
I think 23rd Magus needs to move more to your right.

47:46.440 --> 47:48.440
Move toward the box.

47:48.440 --> 47:49.440
Hump the boxes.

47:49.440 --> 47:51.440
Move the coin door.

47:51.440 --> 47:52.440
Be gentle.

47:52.440 --> 47:53.440
Gentle?

47:53.440 --> 48:04.600
By the way, for the record, diet vanilla Pepsi tastes like shit.

48:04.600 --> 48:09.360
Because aspartame is bad for you, and it turns to a chemical that's like formaldehyde when

48:09.360 --> 48:11.360
heated to body temperature.

48:11.360 --> 48:12.360
Really?

48:12.360 --> 48:21.320
That's why Propel is better for you.

48:21.320 --> 48:28.320
The V8 is made with Splenda, it's the regular, it's not diet splash.

48:31.260 --> 48:37.320
There's real V8 splash in the fridge. He'll go beat up a pineapple so you can have the

48:37.320 --> 48:43.320
juice of the pineapple. This is really good radio. Anyway, so Rob, where's my music?

48:43.320 --> 48:50.320
Sorry, we're still having some buffering issues. Son of a bitch. I'm going to buffer a Comcast

48:50.320 --> 48:57.320
cast in about two seconds.

49:20.320 --> 49:27.320
Okay, there we go.

49:33.920 --> 49:36.440
Okay, the first one of the week

49:36.440 --> 49:37.840
goes toward

49:37.840 --> 49:43.720
one of the moderators on a forum that I will play on, and I'm not going to say the forum yet,

49:43.720 --> 49:47.680
because I actually have no problem with everybody else, but this moderator

49:47.680 --> 49:49.400
is abusing his power.

49:49.400 --> 49:53.300
First of all, okay, this is funny, he accuses me of blaming.

49:53.300 --> 49:56.980
Accuses me of, you know, all this stuff.

49:56.980 --> 49:59.980
The first thing is, how many boards do I moderate on now?

49:59.980 --> 50:02.500
Five, six, seven boards?

50:02.500 --> 50:04.620
An admin three?

50:04.620 --> 50:07.500
Okay, this has struck me, so I've reported

50:07.500 --> 50:11.940
into the side admin, shall we get it in here quickly?

50:11.940 --> 50:13.760
Unless, you know, he's, you know,

50:13.760 --> 50:17.340
drug-humping the admin, then, I don't know.

50:17.340 --> 50:26.340
We'd probably have to be doing more than dry humping the admin to get away with that.

50:26.340 --> 50:32.340
You know, I would give the admin of this site more credit than to have such poor taste, so we'll go ahead.

50:32.340 --> 50:41.340
But, you know, if it turns out that there's no resolution to this soon, then I'm going to do some very public announcements

50:41.340 --> 50:48.340
and, uh, possibly, uh, report the, uh, site to the, uh, to their, uh, sponsors.

50:48.340 --> 50:56.340
Ooh. Because, you know what? There's, there's few things that I tolerate. Everyone knows

50:56.340 --> 51:01.340
me. If I have a problem with the service, even if it's free, oh, I will let them know.

51:01.340 --> 51:08.340
I will let them know. So, yes, I am a good moderator who hardly checks the board anymore.

51:08.340 --> 51:15.340
But no, um, that was really my only thing, and one goes, you know, I was really, I guess,

51:19.340 --> 51:26.340
nobody came to my house to get me people, so I was, so I was there, um, and then, and

51:26.340 --> 51:36.340
So I was there, um, and then really nothing else happened.

51:36.340 --> 51:39.340
Ugh! Alright. It's evil, Sandy.

51:39.340 --> 51:44.340
FINE! I just deleted it off the damn playlist, too.

51:44.340 --> 51:46.340
Rrrrrrrrr!

51:46.340 --> 51:51.340
You guys are never satisfied.

51:51.340 --> 52:00.340
kostjamrh Just keep it. Aaron says they won't be satisfied until you start doing sexual favors.

52:21.340 --> 52:32.340
F.E. to the fact that my stuff costs so much for this damn cabinet, why can't it be free? It's just wood. Trees are dead anyways.

52:32.340 --> 52:48.340
F.E. to the fact that Lowe's doesn't have the size brackets I need for my keyboard tray, so I couldn't get them after wandering hours through that store looking for keyboard tray bracket thingies.

52:48.340 --> 52:52.340
That sucks, but what else.

52:52.340 --> 53:06.340
Oh, I asked you for a cable going out because I was downloading Evil Bed 1-2, Army of Darkness, and Into the Woods, and that stopped about 77%.

53:06.340 --> 53:11.340
I asked you if the people at my work said you suck. You really annoy me.

53:11.340 --> 53:26.340
I have no choice. I can't go down. I have to go up.

53:41.340 --> 53:46.340
I'm just like counting the seconds.

53:46.340 --> 53:48.340
F.E. to NASA.

53:48.340 --> 53:52.340
You know, crashing something that costs 1.5 billion dollars is pretty stupid

53:52.340 --> 53:56.340
just because you didn't want to contaminate a moon on Jupiter

53:56.340 --> 54:00.340
with bacteria that might be on the satellite probe.

54:00.340 --> 54:03.340
Who gives a flying fuck what happens to the moons of Jupiter?

54:03.340 --> 54:07.340
They can fly away and smash into Neptune for all I care.

54:07.340 --> 54:09.340
It doesn't really matter.

54:09.340 --> 54:16.340
They financed that deal when they were trying to unify and automate all of the McDonalds.

54:39.340 --> 54:48.340
to where it, like, you know, registered everything that every store did, but of course that failed and the company lost a lot of money.

54:48.340 --> 54:54.340
Um, FQ2VRAA and MPAA, because you think that you know how to stop people from file sharing?

54:54.340 --> 55:02.340
You know, it's kind of funny because I do remember Napster, you know, and how nothing changed and it's only gotten worse.

55:02.340 --> 55:04.340
So what do you think is going to happen this time?

55:04.340 --> 55:10.340
This time you think it's going to magically solve itself, and oh, people are going to stop because they're getting sued.

55:10.340 --> 55:18.340
No, when you look at the statistics and you have 261 people out of millions of people downloading stuff, that's a pretty small statistic.

55:18.340 --> 55:24.340
Hell, getting struck by lightning, you have more chance than you know.

55:24.340 --> 55:28.340
F.E. to Hurricanes, because they're windy.

55:33.340 --> 55:39.340
Also, F.E. to the fact that I bought these spinners and I can't use them for anything.

55:40.340 --> 55:42.340
That sucks, and I cry.

55:43.340 --> 55:45.340
Those spinners are so nice.

55:46.340 --> 55:50.340
F.E. to people who don't like me talking, because I don't care what you think,

55:50.340 --> 55:52.340
and I'm going to keep talking over and over and over again,

55:52.340 --> 55:55.260
over again and we're going to keep rambling on and on and make the segment

55:55.260 --> 56:02.140
go longer than it really needs to will you talk during the mass bondage orgy oh

56:02.140 --> 56:09.140
yes I'm doing play-by-play for that mass bondage orgy and um f you for not being

56:09.140 --> 56:14.060
super duper rich so I can have an outing at a strip club

56:44.060 --> 56:50.060
Because I was going to buy about another six ferrets, but none of them freaking squeaked.

56:50.060 --> 56:52.060
That would have been hilarious.

56:52.060 --> 56:54.060
Darn. Big darn.

56:54.060 --> 56:56.060
Don't worry.

56:56.060 --> 56:58.060
But anyways.

56:58.060 --> 57:00.060
Chomp that music.

57:00.060 --> 57:02.060
My turn.

57:02.060 --> 57:14.480
My um, my FUs for this week start off with the one and only Comcast, I hate you, you

57:14.480 --> 57:21.060
burn in hell, I hope you catch SARS, and I hope your dick falls off.

57:21.060 --> 57:22.060
You suck.

57:22.060 --> 57:26.280
We have like, our listeners are going through hell tonight trying to listen to this show

57:26.280 --> 57:29.360
because you guys are assifying our connection.

57:29.360 --> 57:40.360
I just made a new verb, acidifying our connection, and you suck, and, yeah.

57:40.360 --> 57:46.360
Well, Comcast may be a guy, but it drives like a woman.

57:46.360 --> 57:49.360
Just kidding, just kidding, just kidding.

57:49.360 --> 57:51.360
Just kidding, God.

57:51.360 --> 57:57.360
That joke was too easy, come on.

57:57.360 --> 58:04.360
That joke was way too easy, come on!

58:04.360 --> 58:05.360
Anyway...

58:05.360 --> 58:18.360
The feng shui of the highway!

58:18.360 --> 58:20.360
Aaron's ranting about old drivers.

58:20.360 --> 58:22.360
Well here, here's the mic.

58:22.360 --> 58:25.360
That's pretty much all I have to ask.

58:25.360 --> 58:28.360
You know what, I'm sure there's plenty of other things I could be mad at right now,

58:28.360 --> 58:30.360
but Comcast takes the fucking cake.

58:30.360 --> 58:34.360
F.U. is microphone quick because I swear to God it's trying to kill me.

58:36.360 --> 58:37.360
Yeah, you have to listen to him.

58:37.360 --> 58:39.360
Wait, no, that was last week.

58:41.360 --> 58:45.360
Alright, moving on, let's hear from our other guests.

58:45.360 --> 58:47.360
Let's start, I guess this Erin has a mic, we'll let her go.

58:47.360 --> 58:50.360
Erin, what do you want to say F.U. to this week?

58:50.360 --> 58:53.640
First of all, another big F.U. to Comcast.

58:53.640 --> 58:56.480
I hope that you guys all rot in hell.

58:56.480 --> 58:58.440
And I will go after you all.

58:58.440 --> 59:00.320
I swear to God, you're worse than AOL.

59:00.320 --> 59:02.560
You all know how AOL is.

59:02.560 --> 59:05.680
Another big F.U. goes to the governor's race right now.

59:05.680 --> 59:08.000
I don't trust Bustamante.

59:08.000 --> 59:10.240
Governor Gray Davis is an idiot, and Schwarzenegger

59:10.240 --> 59:12.520
doesn't know jack shit about politics.

59:12.520 --> 59:17.380
And unfortunately, that looks like the future of our state.

59:17.380 --> 59:18.980
Yeah, vote for the porn star, people!

59:20.980 --> 59:21.780
Oh, you're running.

59:25.080 --> 59:25.780
Jokes!

59:26.480 --> 59:28.280
Jokes. No, we're fine, just keep going.

59:29.280 --> 59:34.080
The problem is, there's a problem between, somewhere between Comcast and Live 365 right now,

59:34.080 --> 59:36.380
so when we're trying to upload the show to Live 365,

59:36.880 --> 59:38.280
we're dropping out, massively.

59:38.280 --> 59:40.680
I mean, but we're still recording as a whole show.

59:40.680 --> 59:45.680
He said Dropout, and we're playing Dropout.

01:00:10.680 --> 01:00:13.140
who start drama over Initial D.

01:00:13.140 --> 01:00:14.520
Now,

01:00:14.520 --> 01:00:19.620
I've been around DDR3 growing enough to know, okay, it's huge, I know there's drama.

01:00:19.620 --> 01:00:23.220
And when there was drama in the Para community, I just said, fuck it, I'm leaving.

01:00:23.220 --> 01:00:29.220
Okay, but when you start drama in the Initial D community, what kind of idiots are you?

01:00:29.220 --> 01:00:30.140
Okay, just because

01:00:30.140 --> 01:00:34.240
some guy is going out with some girl doesn't mean you're going to start spreading rumors about him.

01:00:34.240 --> 01:00:38.900
It's not a high school anymore, get over it!

01:00:38.900 --> 01:00:47.900
This goes to the people who post on the Initial D thread on the board that I mod.

01:00:47.900 --> 01:00:51.900
You guys start Drama again, I will go after all of you.

01:00:51.900 --> 01:00:55.900
Initial D has its own thread? That's sad.

01:00:55.900 --> 01:00:57.900
He'll tell you.

01:00:57.900 --> 01:01:00.900
I'm starting the pole position thread on DDR Free.

01:01:00.900 --> 01:01:04.900
You're a loser. No one plays pole position anymore.

01:01:04.900 --> 01:01:07.900
I play pole position anymore. Screw you.

01:01:07.900 --> 01:01:20.900
That is my ultimatum to all who post on the initial d-thread. I am counting warnings right now, so don't piss me off. And I am nearing that time of the month, so don't piss me off.

01:01:20.900 --> 01:01:29.900
Because if you do, I will go fly. I know people who have large, large swords, and I know where you all live.

01:01:29.900 --> 01:01:34.900
p0k3smot42o is that a sexual innuendo there?

01:01:34.900 --> 01:01:41.900
I mean weapons, actual weapons, metal, sharp metal swords that will slice them all up.

01:01:44.900 --> 01:01:51.900
It's nice that the boards are quiet right now.

01:01:51.900 --> 01:01:58.900
Probably from a fellow moderator of those boards, it's kind of boring now when there's like three new posts a day.

01:01:58.900 --> 01:02:04.420
Well, it's actually kind of nice because you have people posting all the intelligent people true

01:02:04.900 --> 01:02:12.820
If you notice we have no we've had no easy end people. They've had no flame wars. You've had no drama. We're pocket

01:02:14.820 --> 01:02:18.180
Okay, tonight is giving away all right well

01:02:18.180 --> 01:02:20.180
Well, well.

01:02:20.180 --> 01:02:24.180
Actually now that you've blown our cover, there's no Oliver either, thank god.

01:02:29.180 --> 01:02:30.180
Nice!

01:02:30.180 --> 01:02:43.180
I'm done with my FUs other than the fact that a big FU goes to my apartment for the leaky toilet, the noisy fan, the lack of vents which will suffocate me one day and I'm going to kill my landlady, and the wobbly furniture.

01:02:44.180 --> 01:02:45.180
So yeah.

01:02:45.180 --> 01:02:47.180
umm what did you do to andrew?

01:03:15.180 --> 01:03:22.180

01:03:22.980 --> 01:03:29.980

01:03:30.320 --> 01:03:32.220

01:03:32.220 --> 01:03:35.900
so yes that's that's one of them uh...

01:03:35.900 --> 01:03:39.340

their lights on because it makes my life a living hell. So, that'll be it. Um, let's

01:03:59.500 --> 01:04:07.260
hear from Shane. Um, first off, F you to Elko, Nevada. I wanted Taco Bell at night because

01:04:07.260 --> 01:04:12.740
I hadn't eaten anything all day. And is it so hard to keep your stupid store open until

01:04:12.740 --> 01:04:17.380
Like, 10-01, frickin' closing at 10.

01:04:17.380 --> 01:04:24.780
F-you to old people, because I was at Taco Bell,

01:04:24.780 --> 01:04:28.340
and this old guy slammed his door into my parked car

01:04:28.340 --> 01:04:31.620
and tried to blame it on me, because he's old.

01:04:31.620 --> 01:04:34.380
And F-you to my living situation,

01:04:34.380 --> 01:04:36.100
because I sleep out in the living room,

01:04:36.100 --> 01:04:38.700
because they can't seem to find room for me in their rooms.

01:04:38.700 --> 01:04:40.420
So, yeah.

01:04:40.420 --> 01:04:43.340
and if you did driving the california instead of playing because it's really

01:04:43.340 --> 01:04:45.140
boring

01:04:45.140 --> 01:04:46.980

01:04:46.980 --> 01:04:48.860
yeah i feel like one

01:04:48.860 --> 01:04:50.020

01:04:51.600 --> 01:04:54.820

01:04:54.820 --> 01:04:56.140
please help

01:04:56.140 --> 01:04:57.580

01:04:57.580 --> 01:04:58.980
well i mean i was a little

01:04:58.980 --> 01:05:00.740

01:05:00.740 --> 01:05:04.200

01:05:07.900 --> 01:05:11.080
well, fuck his stuff. You're more important.

01:05:11.080 --> 01:05:15.040
We're trying to kick him out by raising his rent. I was going to say, sorry if you're listening, dude,

01:05:15.040 --> 01:05:19.560
but that's not cool to make somebody sleep on the couch unless they're not paying rent if you're being nice.

01:05:19.560 --> 01:05:24.560
And my computer's in the corner, so I can't, like, get any privacy.

01:05:24.560 --> 01:05:27.200
Oh my God.

01:05:27.200 --> 01:05:34.200
You're robbing this man of his Internet pornography. That's horrible. That's great. Jeez.

01:05:34.200 --> 01:05:38.200
Anyway, um, yeah, that's all my F's, so...

01:05:38.200 --> 01:05:39.200
Thank you.

01:05:39.200 --> 01:05:40.200
Andrew.

01:05:44.200 --> 01:05:51.200
First of all, Victor, F you to you, you're not funny, I want my name back, I want my jokes back, bitch.

01:05:51.200 --> 01:05:53.200
All five of them.

01:05:56.200 --> 01:06:01.200
Second of all, F you to people who get my attention by picking up the phone when I'm online.

01:06:01.200 --> 01:06:07.200
Stop it. I'm playing Ragnarok. I'm trying to bend.

01:06:07.200 --> 01:06:10.200
Don't take the phone into the hand. That would be beautiful.

01:06:10.200 --> 01:06:13.200
Either that or I rig up a timer to turn off the TV every time I pick up a phone.

01:06:13.200 --> 01:06:18.200
Or just the phone that she uses. Just pull the cord out from the back so she picks it up and doesn't do anything.

01:06:18.200 --> 01:06:21.200
Oh, sure. She just goes into the other room and picks up her phone.

01:06:21.200 --> 01:06:24.200
Unplug that one too.

01:06:24.200 --> 01:06:28.200
We've got door locks, so...

01:06:28.200 --> 01:06:36.200
Anyway, uh, F you to Sakura, that song is a bitch, past it, like, what, fifth try.

01:06:37.200 --> 01:06:40.200
No, get that whip away from me, Jamie!

01:06:40.200 --> 01:06:44.200
In case you guys are wondering, that's the two ferrets tied up with, uh, my whip.

01:06:44.200 --> 01:06:45.200
On the webcam.

01:06:45.200 --> 01:06:48.200
Yes, on the webcam. So, go ahead, Andy.

01:06:50.200 --> 01:06:55.200
Okay, okay, okay, how about a mutual F you to like in the max, okay? Just to make it balanced.

01:06:55.200 --> 01:06:57.200
Holy shit, she's gonna hit me.

01:07:01.200 --> 01:07:07.200
And once again, f you to Angel not being able to tune in today.

01:07:07.200 --> 01:07:09.200
It's for what? A month and a half.

01:07:09.200 --> 01:07:11.200
Oh shit!

01:07:12.200 --> 01:07:14.200
Parrots flying everywhere!

01:07:18.200 --> 01:07:19.200
Is that Orlando?

01:07:19.200 --> 01:07:20.200
Uh, yeah, that's it.

01:07:20.200 --> 01:07:21.200
Okay.

01:07:22.200 --> 01:07:24.200
Oh, you didn't do it for me? I'm sorry.

01:07:24.200 --> 01:07:26.200
I need to rant a little.

01:07:26.200 --> 01:07:28.200
Come on!

01:07:28.200 --> 01:07:30.200
Jeez, watch out here.

01:07:30.200 --> 01:07:32.200
I don't think any of these balls can sit there.

01:07:32.200 --> 01:07:34.200
Bling that ferret.

01:07:34.200 --> 01:07:36.200
Okay, um...

01:07:36.200 --> 01:07:38.200
Like, uh, yeah, what should I say?

01:07:38.200 --> 01:07:40.200
I don't agree!

01:07:40.200 --> 01:07:44.200
Fuck you to, uh, fuck bad, uh, bike tires

01:07:44.200 --> 01:07:49.200
because my tires on my bike is sitting flat in my room

01:07:49.200 --> 01:07:52.200
because it was broken and I need to get stressed for it.

01:07:52.200 --> 01:07:59.200
And meanwhile, there's Barrett Baseball going on in the living room.

01:07:59.200 --> 01:08:06.200
Look, he almost tripped. I can give play-by-play of Barrett Baseball.

01:08:06.200 --> 01:08:13.200
Look, look. Basing up the middle. Andrew Fielding, the throw home.

01:08:13.200 --> 01:08:35.620
Oh, I'm getting kind of distracted by the fact that Loki is batting a ferret around

01:08:35.620 --> 01:08:36.620
the room.

01:08:36.620 --> 01:08:42.620
And, uh, let's see, well, one of the, that's, damn it, I forgot my FUs!

01:08:42.620 --> 01:08:45.620
Come on, you can remember!

01:08:45.620 --> 01:08:48.620
Don't miss me, Jamie, no!

01:08:50.620 --> 01:08:54.620
I think I have a lot more insanity here!

01:08:54.620 --> 01:08:57.620
I'm gonna back up now.

01:08:57.620 --> 01:09:01.620
I'm going to back up this way out of Jamie's race.

01:09:01.620 --> 01:09:03.620
Ah, barely, yes, out of the race, okay.

01:09:03.620 --> 01:09:30.900
p0k3smot42o

01:09:30.900 --> 01:09:35.900
kostjamrh Hey listen, there's you the ferret. Dear ferret, what do you think of Orangetown's radio?

01:09:42.900 --> 01:09:47.900

01:09:53.900 --> 01:09:58.900
kostjamrh Give them something happy.

01:09:58.900 --> 01:10:06.900
Dartsetsuya would like to say F you to comcast, enough said. Thank you.

01:10:06.900 --> 01:10:08.900
It's com crap.

01:10:08.900 --> 01:10:13.900
Evil Naoki2Dx would like to say fuck comcast for sucking major donkey nuts. Thank you.

01:10:13.900 --> 01:10:18.900
Fuck BT Cruisers, fuck Initial D battle whores over a Riptard arcade.

01:10:18.900 --> 01:10:27.900
Fuck elitist anime con goers who bashed on JTAF just because it was a small con and it wasn't exactly like A-X or anime etc.

01:10:27.900 --> 01:10:34.900
I have something to say, in addition to your initial Battleforce comments.

01:10:34.900 --> 01:10:38.900
Yeah, because they start too much drama.

01:10:38.900 --> 01:10:41.900
I don't know why, I don't know why you guys...

01:10:41.900 --> 01:10:43.900
Yeah, that's all it is, just drama.

01:10:43.900 --> 01:10:47.900
Whatever happened to the times when there was no drama, when everyone was happy?

01:10:47.900 --> 01:10:53.900
Why do you think I play at home?

01:10:53.900 --> 01:10:59.940
Yeah, you don't need to start drama over every single person's life, please stop if you read to the board

01:10:59.940 --> 01:11:01.940
I will be very very angry

01:11:04.460 --> 01:11:07.040
Fuck this live 365 operator guy

01:11:07.580 --> 01:11:13.980
Because when they can't connect to the stream when we go out like 365 operator guy comes on says you're listening to station

01:11:13.980 --> 01:11:15.980
But it's currently unavailable. Please check

01:11:16.940 --> 01:11:19.660
It would be better though if they have like some lounge music playing

01:11:20.140 --> 01:11:22.140
Yes, Tom Jones

01:11:22.140 --> 01:11:27.620
Moving on with Eva Maoki, 2DX's nephews, oh and fuck the lazy ass volunteers who didn't

01:11:27.620 --> 01:11:32.020
do shit in the video game room at JTF and just wanted to get into the con for free.

01:11:32.020 --> 01:11:37.060
And fuck the hotel maids at Best Western Miyako Inn for giving me a hard time.

01:11:37.060 --> 01:11:40.100
A hard time.

01:11:40.100 --> 01:11:45.540
And fuck Uni's dad for being such a cheap ass.

01:11:45.540 --> 01:11:50.980
No Stylin says my nephew of the week is screw little rocks you find in charcoal.

01:11:50.980 --> 01:11:54.220
I mean, God, you buy the good brands and you still get little pebbles in there.

01:11:54.220 --> 01:11:55.220
I go, what the fuck?

01:11:55.220 --> 01:11:59.860
I mean, you pay $1.99 for a stick of good old charcoal, and you get this little pebble.

01:11:59.860 --> 01:12:03.420
It just messes up a good drawing, grr.

01:12:03.420 --> 01:12:10.740
Oh, I thought it was barbecue charcoal.

01:12:10.740 --> 01:12:12.980
You can do really good drawings with barbecue charcoal, though.

01:12:12.980 --> 01:12:18.460
John Fields would like to say, F you to my inability to learn new languages quickly.

01:12:18.460 --> 01:12:23.380
F you to Honda for forgetting to order the part for my car and thus wasting my Saturday.

01:12:23.380 --> 01:12:25.980
F you to RCN for not fixing my cable again.

01:12:25.980 --> 01:12:29.860
Hey, at least they're not as bad as code gals.

01:12:29.860 --> 01:12:35.340
F you to my GameCube making weird clicking sounds and causing PSO to crash all the time.

01:12:35.340 --> 01:12:36.340
That's not good.

01:12:36.340 --> 01:12:37.340
What would you...

01:12:37.340 --> 01:12:41.380
What does it mean if a GameCube is making clicking noises?

01:12:41.380 --> 01:12:42.380
That can't be good.

01:12:42.380 --> 01:12:46.820

a F.U. to stupid computer crap happening to keep me from listening

01:14:26.900 --> 01:14:29.860
You can blame Comcast, send those cards and letters to Comcast

01:14:29.860 --> 01:14:31.700
Kara of Satan

01:14:31.700 --> 01:14:36.380
StaplerX would like to say F.U. to the assholes of J.T.A.F. also

01:14:36.380 --> 01:14:39.700
They took 10 years off our video program head's life.

01:14:42.700 --> 01:14:46.020
You should let me run a movie room at one of those cons.

01:14:46.020 --> 01:14:47.100
I never found out, though.

01:14:47.100 --> 01:14:49.220
D-Archaholic says, F you to cheap tires.

01:14:49.220 --> 01:14:51.140
I had cheap tires on my car for a while.

01:14:51.140 --> 01:14:53.460
Yesterday, as I got off the freeway going home,

01:14:53.460 --> 01:14:55.220
my steering wheel started to wobble.

01:14:55.220 --> 01:14:58.900
I knew it had to be a tire.

01:14:58.900 --> 01:14:59.660
That's it.

01:14:59.660 --> 01:15:02.660
I have read all the FUs that I have been given.

01:15:02.660 --> 01:15:05.900
So if you'd, oh, did one just pop up?

01:15:05.900 --> 01:15:15.420
I got home and found the driver's side front tire starting to shed its tread.

01:15:15.420 --> 01:15:17.980
I took it to Sears.

01:15:17.980 --> 01:15:19.220
The story is coming in a little bit too.

01:15:19.220 --> 01:15:22.380
While the story is going on, I'm going to say I have read all the FUs at this point.

01:15:22.380 --> 01:15:27.020
If you didn't hear yours due to a buffering issue, sorry, we were just trying to go through

01:15:27.020 --> 01:15:28.760
the show as we usually do.

01:15:28.760 --> 01:15:33.260
The show will play in its entirety without these buffering problems, hopefully, provided

01:15:33.260 --> 01:15:37.500
live 365 isn't using Comcast the show will play through in its entirety on Wednesday

01:15:37.500 --> 01:15:42.180
and Thursday and we might actually we might play it tomorrow night after vanilla sky as

01:15:42.180 --> 01:15:43.180
well.

01:15:43.180 --> 01:15:48.780
DD alcoholic says took it to Sears all four of the tires need to get fixed.

01:15:48.780 --> 01:15:58.200
All four, sucks.

01:15:58.200 --> 01:16:02.140
She says actually only three were bad but she might as well change all four.

01:16:02.140 --> 01:16:08.220
Tonight, what do you guys think?

01:16:08.220 --> 01:16:11.340
I don't know if we should do a cage match tonight because of our issues.

01:16:11.340 --> 01:16:12.340
Yes, we're doing a cage match.

01:16:12.340 --> 01:16:13.340
Well, what about because of our issues?

01:16:13.340 --> 01:16:15.220
The guys aren't going to be able to vote.

01:16:15.220 --> 01:16:17.940
They're not able to stay on the stream long enough to hear a song.

01:16:17.940 --> 01:16:19.940
I went to a lot of trouble.

01:16:19.940 --> 01:16:20.940
Poopy on Comcast.

01:16:20.940 --> 01:16:21.940
I went to a lot of trouble.

01:16:21.940 --> 01:16:22.940
Should we table it to next week?

01:16:22.940 --> 01:16:23.940
Okay.

01:16:23.940 --> 01:16:28.940
Yeah, I think we're going to...

01:16:28.940 --> 01:16:30.360
we could

01:16:30.360 --> 01:16:32.060
okay we could do it this way

01:16:32.060 --> 01:16:35.460
we could instead of, well I don't know, I could say instead of letting the chat room vote

01:16:35.460 --> 01:16:38.560
we could let everybody else here vote but that might be kind of

01:16:38.560 --> 01:16:42.340
tough and biased

01:16:42.340 --> 01:16:44.000
I don't know

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:45.180
what do you guys think?

01:16:45.180 --> 01:16:50.280
Hey, are we going to do cage match and have you guys vote?

01:16:50.280 --> 01:16:54.580
we can try to let the listeners do it, let's see what happens

01:16:54.580 --> 01:16:58.700
let us know what you want to do, do you want us to try cage match?

01:16:58.700 --> 01:17:03.700
5 votes in the chatroom, then we're tabling it over to the room here, so that's what we're

01:17:03.700 --> 01:17:04.700
going to do.

01:17:04.700 --> 01:17:05.700
Okay.

01:17:05.700 --> 01:17:08.700
It's not a big deal, but it's pretty nice.

01:17:08.700 --> 01:17:09.700
Oh, sorry.

01:17:09.700 --> 01:17:10.700
She didn't write earlier.

01:17:10.700 --> 01:17:11.700
Okay.

01:17:11.700 --> 01:17:12.700
That's okay.

01:17:12.700 --> 01:17:13.700
It happens.

01:17:13.700 --> 01:17:14.700
Okay.

01:17:14.700 --> 01:17:18.500
They're saying the stream's okay right now, so we're going to do the cage match right

01:17:18.500 --> 01:17:19.500
now.

01:17:19.500 --> 01:17:20.500
Why not?

01:17:20.500 --> 01:17:21.500
Let's just get into it.

01:17:21.500 --> 01:17:24.700
We're doing a commercial free show tonight, apparently.

01:17:24.700 --> 01:17:25.700
That's all right.

01:17:25.700 --> 01:17:29.620
the money's too commercial anyway

01:17:29.620 --> 01:17:31.100
hahaha

01:17:31.100 --> 01:17:32.580
i was funny

01:17:32.580 --> 01:17:35.060
and no one noticed

01:17:35.060 --> 01:17:36.500
hahaha

01:17:36.500 --> 01:17:40.020
last week in the orange lawns radio cage match

01:17:40.020 --> 01:17:44.140
the mp3 that i was sent from dr angel one

01:17:44.140 --> 01:17:48.580
and it was a mislabeled mp3 actually i found out a little just after the show

01:17:48.580 --> 01:17:51.220
i found out the mp3 was actually mislabeled

01:17:51.220 --> 01:17:53.740
you voted for the wrong thing actually

01:17:53.740 --> 01:18:00.920
I said on the show that it was a band called Froggy that won, it's actually Foggy, no R.

01:18:00.920 --> 01:18:05.740
So the band that actually won last night was Foggy, I'm sorry last week, last week, was

01:18:05.740 --> 01:18:09.380
Foggy and the song is called Come Into My Dream.

01:18:09.380 --> 01:18:12.340
So this is the song that won last week.

01:18:12.340 --> 01:18:13.340
Huh?

01:18:13.340 --> 01:18:14.340
You wet?

01:18:14.340 --> 01:18:17.340
Are you downloading the show?

01:18:17.340 --> 01:18:18.340
Oh good.

01:18:18.340 --> 01:18:21.300
Alright, so here it is.

01:18:21.300 --> 01:18:26.100
Um, this is the first song you can vote for tonight.

01:18:27.100 --> 01:18:28.260
Why are you guys laughing?

01:18:29.020 --> 01:18:29.620
Chat room.

01:18:30.620 --> 01:18:33.420
Chat room says, just died.

01:18:33.420 --> 01:18:36.260
As he said, do it this, they say the stream's okay right now.

01:18:36.260 --> 01:18:39.220
So we're going to do, and apparently we dropped right there.

01:18:41.340 --> 01:18:45.300
I think it's still going to work enough for the, uh, for the case match.

01:18:45.300 --> 01:18:52.300
so

01:18:53.440 --> 01:18:58.660
i'm gonna continue

01:18:58.660 --> 01:19:01.940
you know what my monitor stream is still going so

01:19:01.940 --> 01:19:05.940
i think they'll be able to get in

01:19:05.940 --> 01:19:12.540
soooo cage match

01:19:12.540 --> 01:19:18.540
Since we're having a moment of dead airspace, let's offer a moment of silence for our stream.

01:20:42.540 --> 01:21:02.540
Let me show you where I've been It's you and me I've seen

01:21:02.540 --> 01:21:09.540
Let me tell you what I mean In the deep blue sky

01:21:09.540 --> 01:21:16.540
There were rainbows in the night, you and me to fly

01:21:16.540 --> 01:21:20.540
And the ocean shines so bright

01:21:20.540 --> 01:21:25.540
And the ocean shines so bright

01:21:50.540 --> 01:22:13.040
That was a clip of song number one, last week's winner, Foggy with Come Into My Dream.

01:22:13.040 --> 01:22:20.120
Once again, since we're still having some bad connectivity problems, if we don't get

01:22:20.120 --> 01:22:23.320
enough people in the chat room and please don't vote chat room you're on your honor

01:22:23.320 --> 01:22:28.460
tonight please don't vote unless you heard enough of the song where you think you can

01:22:28.460 --> 01:22:32.880
make an honest vote of all the three songs so if we don't get enough votes from the chat

01:22:32.880 --> 01:22:40.240
room we're going to vote in house so because of that i'm going to only ask for scores and

01:22:40.240 --> 01:22:47.140
feedback from the hosts on the next two songs usually usually we let the whole room comment

01:23:17.140 --> 01:23:19.440
and I had it on repeat for a while

01:23:19.440 --> 01:23:24.080
and then I think that I just had it on my playlist I put it in there because

01:23:24.080 --> 01:23:28.900
I didn't really put any thought into it

01:23:28.900 --> 01:23:31.840
alright, so you ready to hit?

01:23:31.840 --> 01:23:38.840
It's Free Fall featuring Jan Johnston with Skydive.

01:24:31.840 --> 01:24:56.840
The first moment before the first touch When you're alone, we have to hold each other

01:24:56.840 --> 01:25:00.840
I've been drawn in love, now stuck away beneath

01:25:00.840 --> 01:25:06.840
Now we're here, we have our own language

01:25:17.840 --> 01:25:24.840
I feel wonderful, I could spell out all my sorrow

01:25:24.840 --> 01:25:27.840
I say, oh, she's my friend

01:25:27.840 --> 01:25:32.840
I'm a fan of sex when my friend screams my name

01:25:32.840 --> 01:25:36.840
I take it as I pray

01:25:36.840 --> 01:25:43.840
To run, run, run, to the moon

01:25:43.840 --> 01:25:48.840
I feel like falling

01:25:59.840 --> 01:26:02.840
This is me before the finish

01:26:02.840 --> 01:26:07.840
You know the money we have to hold each other

01:26:07.840 --> 01:26:11.840
As we travel in love, we suffocate your knees

01:26:11.840 --> 01:26:13.840
Now we're here

01:26:13.840 --> 01:26:17.840
We have our own language

01:26:27.840 --> 01:26:29.840
Connect your words

01:26:29.840 --> 01:26:31.840
I haven't really gone

01:26:31.840 --> 01:26:33.840
Excited to smile

01:26:33.840 --> 01:26:37.840
Even if you're in my sleep

01:26:41.840 --> 01:26:44.840
No wish, no lust, no lie

01:26:44.840 --> 01:26:47.840
As true as our love

01:26:47.840 --> 01:26:49.840
You're my hero

01:26:49.840 --> 01:26:53.840
Heaven did you come

01:27:19.840 --> 01:27:46.340
I feel wonderful, I can start out from the moon

01:27:46.340 --> 01:27:54.980
I sail an ocean on my feathers as the wind screams my name

01:27:54.980 --> 01:28:06.180
Take your hand and pray to run, run, run to you, you, you

01:28:06.180 --> 01:28:14.820
I feel wonderful like a skydive on the moon

01:28:14.820 --> 01:28:21.340
I feel a shiver on my bed with a smile on the bed

01:28:21.340 --> 01:28:29.060
Scream my name, take it out, I'm afraid to run, run, run

01:28:29.060 --> 01:28:34.060
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

01:28:59.060 --> 01:29:06.060
free fall featuring Jan Johnston with skydive let's go around and see what the host thought

01:29:06.060 --> 01:29:13.060
Free Fall featuring Jan Johnston with Skydive, let's go around and see what the hosts thought

01:29:36.060 --> 01:29:43.060
and

01:29:43.680 --> 01:29:46.140
why don't we please

01:29:46.140 --> 01:29:47.200
you don't give

01:29:47.200 --> 01:29:51.960
replace uh... politically jim johnson that would be awesome good idea to your

01:29:51.960 --> 01:29:55.380
konami

uh... so there you go we wouldn't usually this point go around and see

01:29:58.520 --> 01:30:01.400
what our other guests that we don't care what they think we don't care what they

01:30:01.400 --> 01:30:02.180
think no

01:30:02.180 --> 01:30:02.860
no

01:30:02.860 --> 01:30:04.860
What did you pick today?

01:30:04.860 --> 01:30:10.860
I picked this one because, you know, whatever. I made it today. It's cool, I guess.

01:30:10.860 --> 01:30:17.860
It's the Fly, the 2003 Burst mix. It's just a Burst style, I should say.

01:30:17.860 --> 01:30:25.860
Blatantly ripping off of the, what is it, B-Rock You, 1998 Burst style.

01:30:25.860 --> 01:30:30.860
The Fly 2003 Burst Style Loki Vs. The Deep Project

01:30:55.860 --> 01:31:02.860
Alright, well let's have a listen anyway. It's Loki versus Deep Project with the Fly 2003 mix. Here it is, song number three.

01:33:55.860 --> 01:33:57.860
LOKI VS DEEP PROJECT

01:34:25.860 --> 01:34:38.860
I feel a little uneducated to make a vote because I'm not familiar enough with the original song, so I'm not sure how much it was actually remixed, but it sounded very much like a video game racing song. It was very good. I liked it.

01:34:38.860 --> 01:34:46.860
I thought you said you mixed it with electro-tune, but I don't hear it. Is it really sped up or something?

01:35:16.860 --> 01:35:21.500
the legend of trance to begin with because now i have to live up to that and that sucks

01:35:21.500 --> 01:35:24.780
you still need to know the one that i asked for

01:35:24.780 --> 01:35:28.500
was it the safari trance one no the safari trance one just won't work because no one's

01:35:28.500 --> 01:35:29.660
that talented

01:35:29.660 --> 01:35:34.060
well then what's the one you wanted to hear the one with um...

01:35:34.060 --> 01:35:37.860
what was that release your mind

01:35:37.860 --> 01:35:40.300
yeah it has to be tac

01:35:40.300 --> 01:35:44.660
alright guys it's time to vote chat room if i don't get at least five votes

01:35:44.660 --> 01:35:47.420
and please don't vote unless you feel like you can make you heard enough of

01:35:47.420 --> 01:35:51.800
each time to make a decent vote if we don't get five votes in the chat room

01:35:51.800 --> 01:35:56.960
the real room here the live room will vote instead so that's why we haven't

01:35:56.960 --> 01:36:00.280
heard what the guests think of the song chat because they may vote on them so

01:36:00.280 --> 01:36:04.820
let's let's hear a little recap I'm gonna play a little bit extended recaps

01:36:04.820 --> 01:36:07.920
and I usually do because the buffering issues and say you guys I'll have a

01:36:07.920 --> 01:36:13.440
chance to listen one more time because I know you are right okay yeah exactly so

01:36:13.440 --> 01:36:17.440
A little bit of extended clips here, but just enough so you can get an idea of what's going on.

01:36:17.440 --> 01:36:22.440
Here we go, first up, last week's winner, song number one, Foggy, Come Into My Dream.

01:36:47.440 --> 01:36:59.820
All right, song number two, Free Fall, featuring Jan Johnston with Skydive.

01:36:59.820 --> 01:37:15.820
Here it is.

01:37:15.820 --> 01:37:38.700
Alright, song number three you can vote for tonight is Loki vs. Deep Project with the

01:37:38.700 --> 01:37:45.700
fly 2003 mix

01:37:45.700 --> 01:38:13.420
Alright, so those of you in the room, go ahead and write it down on the paper, the one you

01:38:13.420 --> 01:38:15.460
you want to vote for, and fold your paper in half.

01:38:15.460 --> 01:38:18.740
And then we'll look at them in a little bit.

01:38:18.740 --> 01:38:21.660
Otherwise, chat room, if you guys were able to follow us,

01:38:21.660 --> 01:38:27.340
place votes now, or a private message

01:38:27.340 --> 01:38:28.940
to sky in the chat room.

01:38:28.940 --> 01:38:30.540
Anyways, you wanted me to mention this,

01:38:30.540 --> 01:38:32.620
because I mentioned this the other day,

01:38:32.620 --> 01:38:34.660
and because it's also one of the songs I sampled,

01:38:34.660 --> 01:38:38.540
which I might add was not very remixed, but whatever.

01:38:38.540 --> 01:38:40.740
I added a better drum beat to it, and that's it.

01:38:40.740 --> 01:38:41.740
Whoopee doo.

01:38:41.740 --> 01:38:47.820
Anyways, so anyways, I was going to mention that F-Zero GX has three songs that sample

01:38:47.820 --> 01:38:53.580
the song, or actually three songs that remixes the song, The Fly by The Deep Project, which

01:38:53.580 --> 01:39:01.020
also, you might remember, was also sampled in The Legend of Max, which, shut up, you're

01:39:01.020 --> 01:39:06.660
not even on mic, so shut up, shut up, shut up, okay, anyways, so, I was going to play

01:39:06.660 --> 01:39:11.820
Well, clips from the three songs. Let's see here. Let's start off with the first one,

01:39:11.820 --> 01:39:17.980
which was, it's basically these are all the character music for the characters in F-Zero

01:39:17.980 --> 01:39:23.460
GX. We'll start off with Deathborn, which is one of the characters. And we played this

01:39:23.460 --> 01:39:38.460
for my um, let's see anyways. Okay, here we go. Deathborn, that's a remix of a fly, believe

01:39:38.460 --> 01:39:46.580
it or not, which is kind of neat. And then we've also got Blood Falcon's theme, which

01:39:46.580 --> 01:39:55.340
was the one that I remixed, barely. I know it sucked. And it's probably a lot better

01:39:55.340 --> 01:40:00.620
without the crap that I threw on top of it. But anyway, that's Blood Falcon's theme. And

01:40:00.620 --> 01:40:04.500
then we have Black Shadow's theme, which I wanted to remix, but it just didn't work.

01:40:04.500 --> 01:40:11.500
so uh...

01:40:15.300 --> 01:40:20.620
anyway, this is just on Mission X, so it's kinda neat

01:40:20.620 --> 01:40:23.660
F-Zero rocks, cause it's fast

01:40:23.660 --> 01:40:25.520
but uh...

01:40:25.520 --> 01:40:31.860
I admit, I knew from the get-go that that remix wasn't that great

01:40:31.860 --> 01:40:37.220
right now it's gonna throw it in there anyways and cuz I just didn't care be

01:40:37.220 --> 01:40:39.460
glad I didn't choose a chicken dance or something like that

01:40:39.460 --> 01:40:46.780
Oh Rob speaking of the chicken dance there's some place that for the pre-show

01:40:46.780 --> 01:40:49.380
and here in the break

01:40:49.380 --> 01:41:04.220
I only got one vote for cage match from the chat room, so I think we're going to go ahead

01:41:04.220 --> 01:41:07.300
and reveal the winner here, okay?

01:41:07.300 --> 01:41:09.340
Alright, you guys ready?

01:41:09.340 --> 01:41:15.540
Here we go, yep, everybody got him, I got five, so here we go.

01:41:15.540 --> 01:41:18.820
Who is the winner?

01:41:18.820 --> 01:41:22.700
juggle the ferrets. I wish I had the survivor tribal council song here but I

01:41:22.700 --> 01:41:27.860
don't have it so I gotta I gotta find another song to fill in here. Play the

01:41:27.860 --> 01:41:38.260
chicken dance Rob. There's neighbors up there. I got something even better.

01:41:38.260 --> 01:41:46.860
Alright here we go. First vote! 70s porn fabulous. The first vote is for

01:41:46.860 --> 01:41:49.620
whatever Loki's was called

01:41:49.620 --> 01:41:55.820
so that's song number three

01:41:55.820 --> 01:41:59.660
next vote

01:41:59.660 --> 01:42:04.040
second song the one that wasn't foggy or Loki's so one vote for second song one vote for

01:42:04.040 --> 01:42:08.940
third song

01:42:08.940 --> 01:42:11.400
it can't be a tie with five people, impossible

01:42:11.400 --> 01:42:15.220
unless somebody didn't write a vote

01:42:15.220 --> 01:42:16.220
Song number three.

01:42:16.220 --> 01:42:17.740
So Loki's song has two votes.

01:42:17.740 --> 01:42:18.820
Jamie's song has one vote.

01:42:25.940 --> 01:42:29.060
So here's a vote for song one, coming to my dreams.

01:42:29.060 --> 01:42:32.660
So now we have one vote for song one, one vote for song two,

01:42:32.660 --> 01:42:34.220
and two votes for song three.

01:42:34.220 --> 01:42:36.540
It is possible to have a tie with five votes.

01:42:36.540 --> 01:42:37.040
It is.

01:42:37.040 --> 01:42:37.700
Two and two and one.

01:42:37.700 --> 01:42:38.000
Right.

01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:39.920
We might have a tie right here, but that's OK,

01:42:39.920 --> 01:42:43.780
because remember, in case of a tie, the host picks.

01:42:43.780 --> 01:42:45.340
the host who didn't get picked.

01:42:45.340 --> 01:42:47.580
So here it is, the last vote.

01:42:47.580 --> 01:42:49.900
So if it's a vote for song three, song three wins.

01:42:49.900 --> 01:42:52.660
If it's a vote for song one or two, we have a tie.

01:42:52.660 --> 01:42:53.180
Ready?

01:42:56.540 --> 01:43:00.340
Ah, it's a vote for song number one.

01:43:00.340 --> 01:43:05.660
So we have a tie between Foggy and Loki's pick,

01:43:05.660 --> 01:43:06.540
song number three.

01:43:06.540 --> 01:43:09.580
So Jamie, what?

01:43:09.580 --> 01:43:10.620
Who should I vote for?

01:43:10.620 --> 01:43:11.940
Who should you vote for?

01:43:11.940 --> 01:43:17.940
I am getting some votes from the chat room.

01:43:17.940 --> 01:43:18.940
Do you want to hear this?

01:43:18.940 --> 01:43:19.940
Add them in.

01:43:19.940 --> 01:43:20.940
Add them in?

01:43:20.940 --> 01:43:21.940
Well, this is what's interesting.

01:43:21.940 --> 01:43:22.940
Okay, we're going to add them in.

01:43:22.940 --> 01:43:26.940
I don't have to make any decisions, yay.

01:43:26.940 --> 01:43:29.100
Marin actually, well, this is the complicated thing.

01:43:29.100 --> 01:43:33.820
Marin actually, oh, I shouldn't be saying who voted for what because I usually don't.

01:43:33.820 --> 01:43:34.820
My bad.

01:43:34.820 --> 01:43:35.820
Well, it's okay.

01:43:35.820 --> 01:43:36.820
She voted for song two.

01:43:36.820 --> 01:43:37.820
So, that gives us a three-way tie.

01:43:37.820 --> 01:43:38.820
So, we're back to square one.

01:43:38.820 --> 01:43:39.820
Put them all in.

01:44:09.820 --> 01:44:16.700
This is a tough decision. This is a tough decision. I'll tell you why. I'll tell you

01:44:16.700 --> 01:44:20.540
why this is a tough decision. Because Jamie hasn't won in a little while. I've actually

01:44:20.540 --> 01:44:23.580
been winning the cage match. She hasn't won in a while. So I kind of feel bad. So I'm

01:44:23.580 --> 01:44:27.740
like, okay, maybe we should let Jamie win. And I did like her song. On the other hand,

01:44:27.740 --> 01:44:32.460
Loki put a lot of work into his song. Jamie just, Jamie just gets a song from the internet,

01:44:32.460 --> 01:44:37.500
but Loki made his. If you want to feel better, I didn't put that much effort into that. Really,

01:44:37.500 --> 01:44:38.500
I did not.

01:44:38.500 --> 01:44:43.500
The song I picked, though, I was going to pick the Chicken Dance Techno mix.

01:44:43.500 --> 01:44:46.500
Oh, God, I would have voted for that, no problem.

01:44:46.500 --> 01:44:49.500
Wait, I have a happy alternative.

01:44:49.500 --> 01:44:54.500
How about we just take the song that I sampled for the Fly remix, since it's better anyways.

01:44:54.500 --> 01:44:58.500
It's a lot cleaner, doesn't have the loud drum beat over the top of it.

01:44:58.500 --> 01:45:03.500
We'll use that instead of mine.

01:45:03.500 --> 01:45:07.500
I'm thinking I'm going to give it to Jamie tonight.

01:45:37.500 --> 01:45:55.980
Have a conversation and now we let the ferrets talk to you.

01:45:55.980 --> 01:46:03.380
Alright so there's the cage match kind of a little bit fucked up.

01:46:03.380 --> 01:46:10.380
uh...

01:46:10.780 --> 01:46:13.200
uh...

01:46:13.200 --> 01:46:14.340
i think uh...

01:46:14.340 --> 01:46:15.920
them and i think i know

01:46:15.920 --> 01:46:20.340
who isn't there actually some of the money news going on right now no

01:46:20.340 --> 01:46:24.400
yes there is i think we have something he wants to share with you all

01:46:24.400 --> 01:46:27.000
people still play that the money crap

01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:27.800
right

01:46:27.800 --> 01:46:30.880
well let's see uh... what are you got going here

01:46:30.880 --> 01:46:39.240
Well, I know that there's the, um, what was it, the new, um, the Tokyo Gaming Show is

01:46:39.240 --> 01:46:44.040
going on right now, and I know that they had, um, a bunch of Konami games, um, that they

01:46:44.040 --> 01:46:45.040
were showing up.

01:46:45.040 --> 01:46:51.320
Uh, let's see, we've got, um, we've got our internet not working, and, um, okay, here

01:46:51.320 --> 01:46:52.320
we go.

01:46:52.320 --> 01:46:53.320
Uh, the modem's up.

01:46:53.320 --> 01:46:54.320
I know, it's just being slow.

01:46:54.320 --> 01:46:59.480
Anyways, um, there was, um, of course they were showing off DDRStream, which we now pretty

01:46:59.480 --> 01:47:06.440
much know it's going to be exactly like Max 2 is right now. What are you doing? That's

01:47:06.440 --> 01:47:12.400
fine. Anyways, so you have, you know, DDR Extreme obviously was coming out and of course,

01:47:12.400 --> 01:47:17.180
you know, it's pretty much featuring the same stuff as Max 2 USA is, you know, as far as

01:47:17.180 --> 01:47:22.580
the enhanced, you know, diet mode and that kind of stuff. Then there's a new DDR game

01:47:22.580 --> 01:47:29.440
which I'm trying to find a name for right now. Party Mix, I guess. Fancier Revolution

01:47:29.440 --> 01:47:50.240
It's Dance Dance Revolution Party Collection, in other words I think it's Dance Dance Revolution

01:47:50.240 --> 01:47:52.200
Best Hits number 2.

01:47:52.200 --> 01:47:56.320
And you're pretty much going to have, you know, it looks like it's going to be based

01:47:56.320 --> 01:47:59.680
off the DDR Extreme Engine, you know, they don't really show anything other than Diet

01:47:59.680 --> 01:48:07.840
Mode and, you know, standard beginner stuff. So, it has beginner and Diet Mode, you know.

01:48:07.840 --> 01:48:14.680
Other than that, no, obviously, there's going to be, you know, DDR Max coming out next Thursday

01:48:14.680 --> 01:48:22.720
or Wednesday, days away. And so, we'll be getting that if I have money. And then, what

01:48:22.720 --> 01:48:31.500
else. Oh, yeah, we've also got kind of segue into SimNews. StepMania is at StepMania 3.9

01:48:31.500 --> 01:48:40.220
Alpha 5. And so, one thing that's fully supported now is the Dance Magic Mode that's fully supported

01:48:40.220 --> 01:48:47.940
now. It works. It's done. And another thing I thought I'd mention because a lot of SimSites

01:48:47.940 --> 01:48:59.440
are down and you can't find your sim files. But now, now you can go find all your known

01:48:59.440 --> 01:49:08.020
official sim files at www.ddramerica.com slash bttracker and you'll have all your torrents

01:49:08.020 --> 01:49:15.460
for every single, every single like batch, you know, collection of files that was featured

01:49:45.460 --> 01:49:47.460
One second, go!

01:49:47.460 --> 01:49:49.460
Okay, got it.

01:49:49.460 --> 01:49:51.460
Ferret tail sack from the cab.

01:49:51.460 --> 01:49:54.460
Hot ferret action!

01:49:54.460 --> 01:49:57.460
Yeah, that's pretty much that, and um...

01:49:57.460 --> 01:50:00.460
In other news, my cabinet's coming along quite nicely.

01:50:00.460 --> 01:50:02.460
That's it, yeah.

01:50:02.460 --> 01:50:04.460
That's all your Bumani news.

01:50:04.460 --> 01:50:06.460
Oh, and um...

01:50:06.460 --> 01:50:08.460
Yeah, Tack did something, and uh...

01:50:08.460 --> 01:50:10.460
What?

01:50:10.460 --> 01:50:12.460
And Davey perks up like a cat.

01:50:12.460 --> 01:50:17.460
What did my man do? I still have to marry him, you know.

01:50:17.460 --> 01:50:26.460
Well, actually, I was going to mention this. I'm trying to remember where I saw it. I think it was Bomani Style. Oh, I say Bomani Style.

01:50:26.460 --> 01:50:41.460
Thanks, I forgot about that. F you to Bomani Style for putting music on your front page. You suck. What are you thinking? Seriously, okay, now, actually, we really, really like Bomani Style. We do, Logie, we do.

01:50:41.460 --> 01:50:45.460
I don't like your music. Your music sucks.

01:50:45.460 --> 01:50:50.460
I don't mind it being flash, because DDR Maniacs is the same thing.

01:50:50.460 --> 01:50:56.460
DDR Maniacs puts a cookie on your computer so that if you turn it off, it stays off every time you go there.

01:50:56.460 --> 01:51:01.460
If you want it on, you leave it on. But I don't like it on. I like it off.

01:51:01.460 --> 01:51:04.460
It looks like they took down all the media.

01:51:04.460 --> 01:51:06.460
Well, that's because of TAC.

01:51:06.460 --> 01:51:08.460
They took down the media because of TAC.

01:51:08.460 --> 01:51:11.420
You can thank TAC for all the media being gone on

01:51:13.460 --> 01:51:19.180
Yeah, so but anyways I was gonna say that um, there's that um, what was it that beat mania

01:51:20.180 --> 01:51:22.180
concert live thingy

01:51:22.700 --> 01:51:24.300
2dx

01:51:24.300 --> 01:51:26.300
Yeah, 2dx secret concert

01:51:26.860 --> 01:51:28.860
super secret concert anyways

01:51:29.580 --> 01:51:31.580
that was going on and

01:51:31.860 --> 01:51:35.060
There supposedly there was some new songs brought out

01:51:35.060 --> 01:51:41.420
for that. I'm trying to see if I can pull this up here. I just want to say really

01:51:41.420 --> 01:51:45.420
quickly because Jamie's going what huh? If you actually read there's a big long

01:51:45.420 --> 01:51:48.020
post on BimaniStyle where they talked about where they're taking down the

01:51:48.020 --> 01:51:53.360
media and basically most people kind of know by now that read the forums

01:51:53.360 --> 01:51:57.180
frequently of BimaniStyle that TAC has been in touch with the people that run

01:51:57.180 --> 01:52:01.780
BimaniStyle.com and that they were going to try and find a way to

01:52:01.780 --> 01:52:03.740
to distribute Bounce Connected in the US

01:52:03.740 --> 01:52:05.820
through bimanistyle.com.

01:52:05.820 --> 01:52:08.540
And somehow along the way, though, it's

01:52:08.540 --> 01:52:09.540
kind of been inferred.

01:52:09.540 --> 01:52:11.380
And I haven't seen a confirmation

01:52:11.380 --> 01:52:15.100
in this thread of this or whatever, but somehow it

01:52:15.100 --> 01:52:17.140
got around that Tack actually asked

01:52:17.140 --> 01:52:20.020
that the media be stopped.

01:52:20.020 --> 01:52:21.740
Which is interesting because I had also

01:52:21.740 --> 01:52:23.820
heard that he didn't mind so much because he

01:52:23.820 --> 01:52:26.340
was excited that people outside of Japan

01:52:26.340 --> 01:52:27.840
liked his music so much.

01:52:27.840 --> 01:52:30.220
So I don't know, it could have.

01:52:30.220 --> 01:52:37.600
It could be a combination of things though, also if you look in this thread you read a

01:52:37.600 --> 01:52:42.160
lot about bandwidth whores and things like that, people that just leech all day long

01:52:42.160 --> 01:52:45.780
and stuff and they kind of want to explore other parts of what they could do with a money

01:52:45.780 --> 01:52:48.660
styler than just being a leech in today's place.

01:52:48.660 --> 01:52:49.660
That makes sense.

01:52:49.660 --> 01:52:53.900
Anyways, I was going to say that the 2DX here at Live Party Performances, here is the playlist

01:52:53.900 --> 01:52:55.560
for the performances.

01:52:55.560 --> 01:53:02.120
You had set one which is by Tack and he did abstract, electro tunes, slag work, stoic,

01:53:02.120 --> 01:53:06.740
holic, D-X-Y, quasar and traces, so that was kind of neat.

01:53:06.740 --> 01:53:11.660
And then you have Slake was set two, did Breeding, Music to Your Head and a new song which is

01:53:11.660 --> 01:53:14.100
untitled right now.

01:53:14.100 --> 01:53:19.260
Set three was done by Whack which did Linus, Spica, Over the Clouds instead of Regulus,

01:53:19.260 --> 01:53:22.820
Make a Difference, Murmur Twins, Linus and Moon Child.

01:53:22.820 --> 01:53:32.220
And then Akira Yamaoka did Bitmania, In My Eyes, Rizlim, some song in Japanese, a new

01:53:32.220 --> 01:53:43.820
song with no title, and then Good Cool did Never Let You Down, Spin This, Your Body,

01:53:43.820 --> 01:53:45.180
Come With Me, and Spooky.

01:53:45.180 --> 01:53:53.500
And Naoki did Prelude, B-Rocky, and Platonic XXX, the new song that he's going to be doing.

01:53:53.500 --> 01:54:00.660
Then you have DJ Taka, which is Tomorrow's Perfume, Colors, Pandora, the new song by

01:54:00.660 --> 01:54:05.080
DJ Taka, Motion 2003, and Rainbow Flyer, the vocal version.

01:54:05.080 --> 01:54:09.460
So that was kind of neat, and hopefully we'll get MP3s of those new songs soon.

01:54:09.460 --> 01:54:13.380
And the vocal version of Rainbow Flyer was actually not done by Sana, it was done by

01:54:13.380 --> 01:54:21.380
Noria was actually there. Noria being the one that did Glorious Days and the Happy Handbag Song in 9 style. Can't remember what the hell it's called.

01:54:21.380 --> 01:54:27.380
And, uh, Platonic- I'm just picturing the video where she's holding the little happy handbag. What the hell's it called? I know, I can't remember the name of it either.

01:54:27.380 --> 01:54:35.380
Anyways, Platonic XXX is supposed to sound like a Japanese version of Secret Rendezvous with rapping.

01:54:35.380 --> 01:54:35.880
What?

01:54:36.380 --> 01:54:36.880
Yeah

01:54:37.380 --> 01:54:38.380
With rapping

01:54:39.380 --> 01:54:42.380
So you know what that means, it's probably gonna be the next DDR so I mean that's kinda cool

01:54:43.380 --> 01:54:44.380
I don't think that's a bad thing

01:54:44.380 --> 01:54:45.380
I mean it's not bad

01:54:45.380 --> 01:54:46.380
Jeez

01:54:47.380 --> 01:54:48.380
Sylvia Drive

01:54:49.380 --> 01:54:50.380
That's what I was trying to get Sylvia Drive

01:54:50.380 --> 01:54:51.380
I love it

01:54:51.380 --> 01:54:57.380
That's a great, that's a great signature right there

01:54:58.380 --> 01:54:59.380
Nigga stole my bike

01:55:03.380 --> 01:55:04.380
Sorry

01:55:04.380 --> 01:55:06.380
Put that up on the TV thing!

01:55:34.380 --> 01:55:43.420
The far microphone is supposed to stay on on the microphone, and the far microphone

01:55:43.420 --> 01:55:49.420
is supposed to stay far away, and the closed microphone is supposed to stay close.

01:55:49.420 --> 01:55:50.420
Intercepted!

01:55:50.420 --> 01:55:51.420
Yes, Ritz.

01:55:51.420 --> 01:55:52.420
Ritz are mine.

01:55:52.420 --> 01:55:53.420
God dammit.

01:55:53.420 --> 01:55:54.420
I want Nilla Wafers now.

01:55:54.420 --> 01:55:55.420
Oh yes.

01:55:55.420 --> 01:56:02.420
And you get like two and a half crackers.

01:56:02.420 --> 01:56:04.420
And you get like two and a half crackers.

01:56:04.420 --> 01:56:06.420
Yes, this will do nicely.

01:56:06.420 --> 01:56:08.420
And Eric can have the empty box.

01:56:08.420 --> 01:56:10.420
Oh yeah, you know you like it.

01:56:10.420 --> 01:56:12.420
Hahahaha.

01:56:12.420 --> 01:56:13.420
Hahahaha.

01:56:13.420 --> 01:56:14.420
Mmm yeah.

01:56:14.420 --> 01:56:17.420
Snap into a Ritz.

01:56:17.420 --> 01:56:20.420
FU to Pringles because they suck.

01:56:20.420 --> 01:56:22.420
It tastes like crap.

01:56:22.420 --> 01:56:23.420
Pringles?

01:56:23.420 --> 01:56:24.420
The original Pringles suck.

01:56:24.420 --> 01:56:25.420
No, no, no.

01:56:25.420 --> 01:56:30.420
The original Pringles, Pringles now, Pringles in the future will all suck.

01:56:30.420 --> 01:56:34.420
F.U. Delays for trying to copy Pringles and put their stuff in a can.

01:56:34.420 --> 01:56:38.420
Just because you put your chips in a can does not make them any better.

01:56:38.420 --> 01:56:43.420
And what is up with Pib Extra? What is extra about Pib Extra? It tastes exactly the same.

01:56:43.420 --> 01:56:51.420
I have no idea.

01:56:51.420 --> 01:56:53.420
basic physics arid

01:56:53.420 --> 01:56:55.420
fling box

01:56:55.420 --> 01:56:56.420
ferret go

01:56:56.420 --> 01:56:58.420
insert ferret into ritz box

01:56:58.420 --> 01:57:00.420
insert ferret towards end of ritz box

01:57:00.420 --> 01:57:02.420
fling ritz box

01:57:02.420 --> 01:57:04.420
ferret flies

01:57:04.420 --> 01:57:06.420
um

01:57:06.420 --> 01:57:08.420
are we done about news?

01:57:08.420 --> 01:57:09.420
i'm done

01:57:09.420 --> 01:57:11.420
i'm thinking you guys

01:57:11.420 --> 01:57:13.420
what do you guys think about just making

01:57:13.420 --> 01:57:15.420
where'd jamie go?

01:57:15.420 --> 01:57:17.420
what are you guys thinking about just making it a two hour show tonight?

01:57:17.420 --> 01:57:19.420
just like old days

01:57:19.420 --> 01:57:26.420
Because we have new listeners, we're pretty much done with a lot of our topics, can't really interact with the chatroom tonight, so...

01:57:26.420 --> 01:57:31.420
We're pretty much dead in the water, and we can all thank Comcast for that, cunts.

01:57:31.420 --> 01:57:33.420
No, we don't have to know our...

01:57:33.420 --> 01:57:34.420
So, um...

01:57:34.420 --> 01:57:36.420
No listeners, huh? Not very many listeners?

01:57:36.420 --> 01:57:38.420
Well, I mean, no, we have...

01:57:38.420 --> 01:57:43.420
God bless the chatroom, they're trying to get in, they're hammering to get in, they're just trying their best...

01:57:43.420 --> 01:57:47.420
Stop ramming the stream!

01:57:47.420 --> 01:57:52.500
Everyone give a fuck you to live 365 for this sucking no no no it's not it's not

01:57:52.500 --> 01:57:58.700
why 365 it's Comcast and life is just five link is fucked up so it's more

01:57:58.700 --> 01:58:03.660
Comcast fault 365 should be over the head of being hammered their frickin

01:58:03.660 --> 01:58:07.340
internet radio station that hosts thousands and thousands of internet

01:58:07.340 --> 01:58:12.180
radio oh they're playing with my erotic poetry

01:58:12.180 --> 01:58:18.180
So, I'm going to go around this time and get everyone's final thoughts.

01:58:18.180 --> 01:58:22.180
Read the erotic poetry first.

01:58:22.180 --> 01:58:29.180
So, Jamie has written, your vagina breath blows.

01:58:29.180 --> 01:58:34.180
I have written, you suck enormous cock.

01:58:34.180 --> 01:58:37.180
And now we're waiting for Jamie to do another one.

01:58:37.180 --> 01:58:40.180
My girlfriend wrote, and this is, let me, um, this,

01:58:40.180 --> 01:58:44.980
a dirty dog's, um, hey, what happened?

01:58:44.980 --> 01:58:48.980
He took a nervous ca- okay, a dirty dog's a nervous cock plunged into my ass.

01:58:48.980 --> 01:58:52.180
I swallowed his wiggling shaft, smeared-

01:58:52.180 --> 01:58:53.680
He took some more words out of there!

01:58:53.680 --> 01:58:57.180
And smeared his pudding on my pink pussy.

01:58:57.180 --> 01:58:59.180
You're, you're a vagina plus.

01:58:59.180 --> 01:59:04.480
Okay, that doesn't make any sense now, because there's stuff being removed.

01:59:04.480 --> 01:59:06.760
Then I put velvet jelly love juice.

01:59:09.760 --> 01:59:12.800
All right, let's get final thoughts.

01:59:12.800 --> 01:59:15.880
We're going to start today with, let's start.

01:59:15.880 --> 01:59:17.680
I'll start final thoughts with Andrew.

01:59:20.680 --> 01:59:24.200
You don't pay me enough to think.

01:59:24.200 --> 01:59:26.280
Shane, thank you so much for being here tonight.

01:59:26.280 --> 01:59:29.520
And I'm sorry that Comcast sucks a big fat cock.

01:59:29.520 --> 01:59:31.240
Yeah, I meant to give them a nephew just

01:59:31.240 --> 01:59:33.520
to be cool like everybody else, but I forgot.

01:59:33.520 --> 01:59:34.520
But thank you for being here.

01:59:34.520 --> 01:59:35.520
Oh, thank you.

01:59:35.520 --> 01:59:36.520
And I hope you had fun anyway.

01:59:36.520 --> 01:59:37.520
I did.

01:59:37.520 --> 01:59:38.520
Good.

01:59:38.520 --> 01:59:39.520
We enjoyed Dance Summit, by the way.

01:59:39.520 --> 01:59:40.520
It was fun.

01:59:40.520 --> 01:59:41.520
Yeah, it's cool.

01:59:41.520 --> 01:59:42.520
So, we'll see you.

01:59:42.520 --> 01:59:46.520
It sounds like we may see you on Wednesday here for the Max 2 show, anyway.

01:59:46.520 --> 01:59:49.520
Yeah, since I won't be in San Fran anymore.

01:59:49.520 --> 01:59:50.520
Just cry.

01:59:50.520 --> 01:59:51.520
Sadness.

01:59:51.520 --> 01:59:52.520
Can you come over for vanilla sky if you want tomorrow?

01:59:52.520 --> 01:59:53.520
Okay, yeah.

01:59:53.520 --> 01:59:54.520
I'll have nothing better to do.

01:59:54.520 --> 01:59:55.520
All right, we'll see.

01:59:55.520 --> 01:59:56.520
We'll get somewhere.

01:59:56.520 --> 01:59:57.520
Hopefully I can do that show.

01:59:57.520 --> 01:59:58.520
We'll see.

01:59:58.520 --> 02:00:01.520
Joey, thanks for being here again.

02:00:01.520 --> 02:00:02.520
No problem.

02:00:02.520 --> 02:00:03.520
Final thought?

02:00:03.520 --> 02:00:04.520
Not really.

02:00:04.520 --> 02:00:07.520
Congratulations on the three-footer once again, then.

02:00:07.520 --> 02:00:08.520
Thank you.

02:00:08.520 --> 02:00:09.520
That means, you know what?

02:00:09.520 --> 02:00:12.520
If you keep at this pace, next week will be six-footers.

02:00:12.520 --> 02:00:13.520
In three weeks, you'll have the Caddos down.

02:00:13.520 --> 02:00:14.520
You'll be just like us.

02:00:14.520 --> 02:00:15.520
Just like that.

02:00:15.520 --> 02:00:21.520
I don't think I can work that magic, but I'll still try.

02:00:21.520 --> 02:00:27.520
Poppy, sorry I drive out here all the way from Davis for an under par show, but they're

02:00:27.520 --> 02:00:29.520
always interesting, aren't they?

02:00:29.520 --> 02:00:30.520
Yeah.

02:00:30.520 --> 02:00:34.160
At least I can actually know what's going on instead of having to sit at my computer

02:00:34.160 --> 02:00:37.480
listening to a live station like no one else.

02:00:37.480 --> 02:00:41.480
This damn signal thing annoys me.

02:00:41.480 --> 02:00:47.920
Alright, Erin thanks for coming.

02:00:47.920 --> 02:00:53.680
Sorry Erin that your first show had to be kind of a weird one, but you can thank Comcast

02:00:53.680 --> 02:00:54.680
for that.

02:00:54.680 --> 02:00:55.680
It's cool.

02:00:55.680 --> 02:00:56.680
But I have a feeling you'll be back.

02:00:56.680 --> 02:00:57.680
Miss Puppy.

02:00:57.680 --> 02:00:58.680
Good.

02:00:58.680 --> 02:00:59.680
Good, I'm glad to hear it.

02:00:59.680 --> 02:01:03.680
Actually, I forgot to add one last FU. I kind of thought of it right now.

02:01:03.680 --> 02:01:04.680
Oh, what the hell. Go for it.

02:01:04.680 --> 02:01:07.680
It was to the scan you went to, was it? Sacramento's?

02:01:07.680 --> 02:01:08.680
Yes.

02:01:08.680 --> 02:01:13.680
Sacramento's for having a fucked up right side pad.

02:01:13.680 --> 02:01:21.680
Because, yeah, on Max 2, I don't know why, but I ended up failing the whistle song maniac.

02:01:21.680 --> 02:01:25.680
How? I don't know.

02:01:25.680 --> 02:01:29.680
and uh... jamie wrote another piece of erotic poetry

02:01:29.680 --> 02:01:35.680
taste her nasty burning crack cream

02:01:35.680 --> 02:01:38.600
i don't want to know but yeah

02:01:38.600 --> 02:01:43.080
so uh... fuck scandia for really fucked up pads

02:01:43.080 --> 02:01:45.400
and stupid teeny boppers

02:01:45.400 --> 02:01:49.360
ghetto quote unquote ghetto people

02:01:49.360 --> 02:01:53.680
and the retards

02:01:53.680 --> 02:01:56.220
And yeah.

02:01:56.220 --> 02:01:59.080
Jamie, your final thought?

02:01:59.080 --> 02:02:01.960
Logie, your final thought?

02:02:01.960 --> 02:02:05.040
My mouth is full of cracker.

02:02:05.040 --> 02:02:08.040
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

02:02:08.040 --> 02:02:10.560
My final thought is this.

02:02:10.560 --> 02:02:11.840
We live in America.

02:02:11.840 --> 02:02:15.840
It's about competition, being a capitalist society,

02:02:15.840 --> 02:02:18.600
making money at the expense of other people.

02:02:18.600 --> 02:02:21.680
I beg you, anybody that's out there listening,

02:02:21.680 --> 02:02:25.240
sure west eighty and see what will not eighteen t because that's exactly part

02:02:25.240 --> 02:02:25.960
of congress

02:02:25.960 --> 02:02:29.260
sure west anybody out there that's listening

02:02:29.260 --> 02:02:32.720
build a competitive cable company in this area

02:02:32.720 --> 02:02:34.900
and bring it out there where we live

02:02:34.900 --> 02:02:35.880
win first

02:02:35.880 --> 02:02:38.260
god please any wolf with respect to it

02:02:38.260 --> 02:02:40.020
bird bob i sure as to

02:02:40.020 --> 02:02:44.380
does it always have to keep talking buying each other out accepted if you

02:02:44.380 --> 02:02:48.320
have one first you can't and look at deviant art so don't go to them

02:02:48.320 --> 02:02:52.120
And you might not see it on the webcam, but I just took off my pants.

02:02:52.120 --> 02:02:53.120
Oh, no!

02:02:53.120 --> 02:02:54.120
Why is that?

02:02:54.120 --> 02:02:55.120
Not your pants.

02:02:55.120 --> 02:02:56.120
Why'd you...

02:02:56.120 --> 02:02:57.120
They banned it.

02:02:57.120 --> 02:03:04.120
They blocked anyone with that ISP for actually going in and saving the pictures off their

02:03:04.120 --> 02:03:05.120
site.

02:03:05.120 --> 02:03:06.120
That's assy.

02:03:06.120 --> 02:03:13.160
I beg any other competing cable company out there, please, please come out here and give

02:03:13.160 --> 02:03:15.560
a competitive, give Comcast some competition.

02:03:15.560 --> 02:03:17.160
They have a monopoly on the market.

02:03:17.160 --> 02:03:19.240
This is the problem that we have.

02:03:19.240 --> 02:03:23.040
The reason why this sucks, you guys, I would not put up with this shit, going through live

02:03:23.040 --> 02:03:24.300
65 and Comcast.

02:03:24.300 --> 02:03:25.300
You guys remember...

02:03:25.300 --> 02:03:27.440
It's actually very good in the...

02:03:27.440 --> 02:03:28.600
I'm talking dish.

02:03:28.600 --> 02:03:30.000
You can't get win first out here.

02:03:30.000 --> 02:03:31.480
Oh, this is bad.

02:03:31.480 --> 02:03:32.480
Yeah.

02:03:32.480 --> 02:03:35.040
Because actually, I've used their service at my friend's house and it's really good

02:03:35.040 --> 02:03:36.040
service.

02:03:36.040 --> 02:03:39.800
When, assuming that Loki and I move again in April, which I'm thinking is probably going

02:03:39.800 --> 02:03:43.760
to be the case, I think we're going to go somewhere where we can get DSL instead of

02:03:43.760 --> 02:03:44.760
cable.

02:03:44.760 --> 02:03:45.760
Move closer!

02:03:45.760 --> 02:03:46.760
Yes!

02:03:46.760 --> 02:03:47.760
We'll see.

02:03:47.760 --> 02:03:48.760
We'll see.

02:03:48.760 --> 02:03:49.760
Or buy me gas.

02:03:49.760 --> 02:03:50.760
We'll see.

02:03:50.760 --> 02:03:51.760
Or build a teleporter.

02:03:51.760 --> 02:03:52.760
What, Joey?

02:03:52.760 --> 02:03:53.760
We don't need to talk about it.

02:03:53.760 --> 02:03:54.760
You can't get SPC-DSL.

02:03:54.760 --> 02:03:55.760
DSL is not supported up here.

02:03:55.760 --> 02:03:56.760
Because we live out in Illinois.

02:03:56.760 --> 02:03:57.760
All right, I'm done.

02:03:57.760 --> 02:03:58.760
That's it.

02:03:58.760 --> 02:04:05.440
I just beg somebody to compete with Comcast, please.

02:04:05.440 --> 02:04:06.640
I need another option.

02:04:06.640 --> 02:04:09.760
I don't like this monopoly they have on the market on high-speed Internet.

02:04:09.760 --> 02:04:10.760
Loki.

02:04:10.760 --> 02:04:11.760
What?

02:04:11.760 --> 02:04:12.760
Final thought.

02:04:12.760 --> 02:04:13.760
Oh, I have to contribute, actually.

02:04:13.760 --> 02:04:14.760
Oh, I had a final thought.

02:04:14.760 --> 02:04:15.760
Loki.

02:04:15.760 --> 02:04:17.760
I thought you were going to gauge your final thoughts.

02:04:17.760 --> 02:04:18.760
What?

02:04:18.760 --> 02:04:20.760
Here's my contribution to your cabinet.

02:04:20.760 --> 02:04:23.760
Whoo!

02:04:23.760 --> 02:04:25.760
I got more change.

02:04:25.760 --> 02:04:28.760
We could.

02:04:28.760 --> 02:04:31.760
I want my coin to be the first one in the coin slot.

02:04:31.760 --> 02:04:34.760
Sorry, I already put one in there.

02:04:34.760 --> 02:04:36.760
It could be the donation box.

02:04:36.760 --> 02:04:38.760
That's what it is.

02:04:38.760 --> 02:04:40.760
For kind donations.

02:04:40.760 --> 02:04:42.760
Money for me.

02:04:42.760 --> 02:04:44.760
No, my final thought is...

02:04:44.760 --> 02:04:50.600
Why does the sun have to be so hot?

02:04:50.600 --> 02:04:51.600
Because it is.

02:04:51.600 --> 02:04:52.600
I don't know.

02:04:52.600 --> 02:04:55.080
It's because it's a big nuclear tank.

02:04:55.080 --> 02:04:59.720
What do you get when you cross a bungee cord with an owl?

02:04:59.720 --> 02:05:01.720
My ass.

02:05:01.720 --> 02:05:05.800
Alright, final word of the show.

02:05:05.800 --> 02:05:10.200
I'm going to give it to Shane because for God's sake she came how far out here?

02:05:10.200 --> 02:05:11.760
I didn't give my final thought.

02:05:11.760 --> 02:05:12.760
You did, didn't you?

02:05:12.760 --> 02:05:18.360
general thought is my foot repeatedly kicking your butt and I'm done. Oh, by the way, in

02:05:18.360 --> 02:05:24.120
regards to my F.U. of the week, again, I'm not really pissed off at that site. I'm pissed

02:05:24.120 --> 02:05:29.200
off at that person. And I freaking hate people who abuse their power, so I hope that he catches

02:05:29.200 --> 02:05:30.200
stars of the genitals.

02:05:30.200 --> 02:05:37.000
Oh, I just want to say another F.U. to people that play this game. I know something you

02:05:37.000 --> 02:05:42.160
don't know. I know something you don't know. I fucking hate that shit. I know something

02:05:42.160 --> 02:05:45.840
you don't know, I know something you don't know.

02:05:45.840 --> 02:05:47.920
I probably know lots of things y'all don't know.

02:05:47.920 --> 02:05:51.760
But see, it's one thing to know it and keep it a secret

02:05:51.760 --> 02:05:53.720
that you know it, but it's another thing.

02:05:53.720 --> 02:05:58.480
I'm never telling you what the quadratic formula is, never.

02:05:58.480 --> 02:06:02.240
It's another thing to be all like openly admitting you

02:06:02.240 --> 02:06:03.980
know shit and you're just being a dick

02:06:03.980 --> 02:06:05.900
and not wanting to share it for whatever reason.

02:06:05.900 --> 02:06:08.240
I know what the antidote is.

02:06:08.240 --> 02:06:09.760
For your mental retardation?

02:06:09.760 --> 02:06:11.800
No.

02:06:11.800 --> 02:06:13.800
He go nasty, he get nasty.

02:06:13.800 --> 02:06:15.800
You really know what happen if you take the other pill?

02:06:17.800 --> 02:06:19.800
The birth control pill?

02:06:19.800 --> 02:06:21.800
I don't know, do you know something about that?

02:06:21.800 --> 02:06:23.800
Nope.

02:06:23.800 --> 02:06:24.800
It cures acne.

02:06:24.800 --> 02:06:25.800
It cures acne?

02:06:25.800 --> 02:06:26.800
Listen, really? I didn't do that.

02:06:26.800 --> 02:06:28.800
Actually, my acne, when I...

02:06:28.800 --> 02:06:29.800
Move your hand.

02:06:29.800 --> 02:06:31.800
I...

02:06:33.800 --> 02:06:35.800
Move your hand, don't take it off.

02:06:35.800 --> 02:06:38.800
I have to say this, I was on birth control for a little while.

02:06:38.800 --> 02:06:42.800
It made me an insane psycho bitch, but I had really good skin.

02:06:42.800 --> 02:06:46.800
There you go.

02:06:46.800 --> 02:06:51.800
If you take the red pill, I'll show you how deep this hole goes.

02:06:51.800 --> 02:06:56.800
If you take the blue pill, I'll give you an erection.

02:06:56.800 --> 02:07:00.800
Right, anyway.

02:07:00.800 --> 02:07:01.800
Wait, hold on.

02:07:01.800 --> 02:07:05.800
No, we can't have final word yet because I don't have the end of the show queued up.

02:07:05.800 --> 02:07:06.800
Good job.

02:07:06.800 --> 02:07:07.800
I'm with it today.

02:07:07.800 --> 02:07:12.200
I'm just writing this show off, you guys, you know how like big companies when they

02:07:12.200 --> 02:07:17.320
discover like million dollar debts they have and stuff, they just write it off?

02:07:17.320 --> 02:07:18.320
Enron?

02:07:18.320 --> 02:07:19.320
Yeah.

02:07:19.320 --> 02:07:21.200
I think you guys were just writing tonight off.

02:07:21.200 --> 02:07:24.600
This one needs to be like the lost episode.

02:07:24.600 --> 02:07:25.600
Seriously.

02:07:25.600 --> 02:07:29.320
This is one of the other lost episodes.

02:07:29.320 --> 02:07:31.960
Jamie Dubbs is the lost episode.

02:07:31.960 --> 02:07:42.480
was lost in the void, the big hole, cavernous vagina that is Comcast. Unfortunately, the

02:07:42.480 --> 02:07:48.320
end of this show was lost on its way overseas, but it was finished by the Korean recording

02:07:48.320 --> 02:07:54.680
artists. Hope you enjoy. For those keeping score at home, I just showed another dropout

02:07:54.680 --> 02:08:01.680
on live 365 that's 36 dropouts tonight you guys during the show we drop 36 times we really

02:08:02.880 --> 02:08:09.880
need one more for that one more drop one more drop come on come on motherfucker let me let

02:08:10.920 --> 02:08:14.920
me like bog down computer resources come on get it to drop again come on we need 37 we

02:08:14.920 --> 02:08:21.920
need 37 in a row come on come on Aaron has something to say you know I really wonder

02:08:21.920 --> 02:08:29.920
You know, I really wonder if we'll ever find a cock large enough to rape Comcast and be asked for everything they've done to us tonight.

02:08:29.920 --> 02:08:32.920
I don't know, but I'd be willing to try.

02:08:32.920 --> 02:08:35.920
Yes, big steel-dizzle up here.

02:08:35.920 --> 02:08:38.920
I'm sorry, I don't think you're large enough.

02:08:38.920 --> 02:08:43.920
I think it would have to be, like, a collective cock.

02:08:43.920 --> 02:08:48.920
You know, that's like one cock together.

02:08:48.920 --> 02:08:54.920
I think the cock has to be at least large enough so that in proportion to testicles should be about as large as bean bag chairs.

02:08:54.920 --> 02:09:04.920
We could get Paul and Terry and give it a try.

02:09:04.920 --> 02:09:11.920
Okay, Rod's over here dragging us. 37 in a row.

02:09:11.920 --> 02:09:14.920
37 drop. Quick, end the show. Shane, final word.

02:09:14.920 --> 02:09:17.920
Comcast.

02:09:17.920 --> 02:09:30.920
You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio. Orange Lounge Radio is hosted by Dark Sakura, Skye and Loki. We expect you a nice play again. And now, here's your fortune cookie message of the day.

02:09:30.920 --> 02:09:35.920
Don't play you hate on me. Play you hate somebody else.

02:09:35.920 --> 02:09:48.920
Yo. Yo, yo. I'm a gangster. Where my dogs at? Bark with me if you're my dog. Yo, yo, yo. I'm going to give a shout out to all the player haters.

02:09:48.920 --> 02:09:49.920
I don't like player haters.

02:09:49.920 --> 02:09:51.920
If you're a player hater, don't player hate on me.

02:09:51.920 --> 02:09:52.920
Player hate somewhere else.

02:09:52.920 --> 02:09:55.920
I'm a gangster. I'm straight up.

02:09:57.920 --> 02:09:59.920
Straight up a gangster, dude.

02:09:59.920 --> 02:10:14.480
I'm a gangster, I'm a straight-up G. The gangster life is the life for me. Shooting people by

02:10:14.480 --> 02:10:20.880
day, selling drugs by night. Being a gangster is hella tight. I walk around town with a

02:10:20.880 --> 02:10:26.760
stark erection, then gave your mom a yeast infection. I saw the policeman and I punched

02:10:26.760 --> 02:10:29.760
To serve and protect? What a lie!

02:10:29.760 --> 02:10:32.760
I also don't like white people, you shouldn't too

02:10:32.760 --> 02:10:35.760
And don't get me started about the Jews

02:10:35.760 --> 02:10:38.760
I'm a gangster, grrr I'm mad

02:10:38.760 --> 02:10:40.760
I'm a gangster, my rhymes are bad

02:10:40.760 --> 02:10:43.760
I'm a gangster, I'm iced out like a freezer

02:10:43.760 --> 02:10:46.760
I'm a gangster, I don't listen to Weezer

02:10:46.760 --> 02:10:49.760
I dropped out of school at the age of three

02:10:49.760 --> 02:10:49.760
Why?

02:10:49.760 --> 02:10:51.760
Cause all the teachers tried to play your hate on me

02:10:51.760 --> 02:10:52.760
Oh

02:10:52.760 --> 02:10:55.760
My rhymes are cool, just like doing cocaine

02:10:55.760 --> 02:10:58.760
My rhymes are hot, like a burning flame

02:10:58.760 --> 02:11:00.760
Cisco is my homie, he's a gangster too

02:11:00.760 --> 02:11:03.760
Me and Cisco are the leaders of the gangster crew

02:11:03.760 --> 02:11:06.760
I like to be in jail and he likes to sing and dance

02:11:06.760 --> 02:11:09.760
Some say we're the perfect match

02:11:09.760 --> 02:11:13.760
Step off, step back, step away

02:11:13.760 --> 02:11:18.760
Step back, don't step forward

02:11:18.760 --> 02:11:20.760
Step back, don't step forward

02:11:20.760 --> 02:11:23.760
Step backwards, backwards, don't step at me

02:11:23.760 --> 02:11:29.400
I'm giving a shout out to my homies in cell block 8

02:11:29.400 --> 02:11:32.320
Being in jail sucks cause you always have to masturbate

02:11:32.320 --> 02:11:35.080
Except when a Jewish person goes to jail, all my homies cheer

02:11:35.080 --> 02:11:40.440
They will make mincemeat out of his rear Ben Petty helped me make the gangster beats

02:11:40.440 --> 02:11:42.960
in a song I shot him in the face cause he looked at

02:11:42.960 --> 02:11:44.920
me wrong I'm a gangster

02:11:44.920 --> 02:11:47.920
I drop bombs like Hiroshima I'm a gangster

02:11:47.920 --> 02:11:50.800
Bitch suck on my wiener I'm a gangster

02:11:50.800 --> 02:11:56.360
I drive a cool car, I'm a gangster, I smoke weed in a cigar, yo!

02:11:56.360 --> 02:11:58.360
My gangster flow, yo!

02:11:58.360 --> 02:12:01.360
Yo, yo, yo!

02:12:01.360 --> 02:12:02.360
Yo!

02:12:02.360 --> 02:12:03.360
Yo!

02:12:03.360 --> 02:12:04.360
Yo!

02:12:04.360 --> 02:12:05.360
Yo!

02:12:05.360 --> 02:12:11.360
I'm rolling on dubs, ice out like hockey, I got kicked out of Japan for drinking all

02:12:11.360 --> 02:12:17.360
the sake, fuck a bitch, give me head, hoe, what's up to my dogs, yo, yo, yo!

02:12:17.360 --> 02:12:20.360
They're playing a song on the radio all day long

02:12:20.360 --> 02:12:23.360
So everyone can hear my gangster song

02:12:23.360 --> 02:12:26.360
Nobody thought I'd blow up like a firestone tire

02:12:26.360 --> 02:12:28.360
Oh, there's no beat left

02:12:29.360 --> 02:12:33.360
Die! Die, Santa Claus, die!

02:12:34.360 --> 02:12:36.360
No, I don't want to do acapella

02:12:37.360 --> 02:12:39.360
I like to slap bitches

02:12:39.360 --> 02:12:41.360
I like to slap hoes

02:12:41.360 --> 02:12:45.760
Thanks for listening, and we'll see you next week.
