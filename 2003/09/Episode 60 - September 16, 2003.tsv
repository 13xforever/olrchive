8157	12313	Toto, I have a feeling we're not in Kansas anymore.
15956	20820	You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio, where mommy talks and then some.
21521	24244	Uh, mostly the and then some part of that.
24604	28627	Orange Lounge Radio is created by a bunch of potty-mouthed adults.
29268	34072	Orange Lounge may contain sexual, perverted, and mildly retarded content.
34653	38356	You probably shouldn't let your children listen to Orange Lounge Radio.
38697	40178	Yes, I will spank your child.
40578	42300	If you're not going to do your job, goddammit, I will.
47110	49151	Well, here's to my big opening.
49712	50832	A sphincter says what?
50852	53134	I'm super, thanks for asking.
53494	56095	Oh, you little bitch troll from hell.
56135	58137	What am I doing here?
58177	59717	No.
59958	61278	Dodge this.
61779	63620	This is a tasty burger.
63880	66341	Look, you stupid bastard, you've got no arms left.
66561	67182	Yes, I have.
67602	69403	Look, there's a flesh wound.
69623	75787	Searching for a boy in high school is as useless as searching for meaning in a polyshorum.
76835	77556	Oh yeah?
77776	81038	Well, I hope your babies look like monkeys.
81318	82379	DarkSakura.
82559	83460	I've had a sniff.
83720	84260	Skye.
84361	86442	But I'm playing it for the bartender, so suffer.
86822	87343	Loki.
87603	88604	I hate you!
89024	91085	Orange Lounge Radio.
91306	92246	We're live!
92306	95068	This is episode 60 for September 14th.
97386	103948	2003.
97826	103948	You're tuned into the Vimani Scene's most late show of all things Vimani.
104348	106049	My name is Loki.
108029	110870	And, well, Rob's not here because he's a slacker.
112210	113331	He is a slacker.
114891	115831	We're on time.
115851	116371	Where is he?
116752	119552	Let's start with the fuckies of the week.
119852	120573	Dear Rob...
122432	127015	Okay, and in this corner, the happiest bunny on the farm, DarkSakura.
127616	127816	Hi.
128617	129337	I have a sandwich.
130138	130678	It's tasty.
130698	134321	I have cookies, too, and I'm going to maul anyone who touches them.
134901	135182	Cool.
136122	137443	And in this corner, we have Rob.
137703	138704	Hi, I'm Rob.
138884	141466	I'm not here right now, but please take a message.
142907	143388	Beep.
143408	143488	Beep.
144956	158106	Today we're going to be talking about lots of Omani stuff and other things and what we did this week and my birthday because I rock and other things.
158846	160507	Also in the studio we have a few guests.
161848	162429	Two guests.
163149	166612	Hey, we're going to have a few by the time this show is over, okay?
167212	170314	First off, we have Arcadian42, Bradley.
170835	172016	Hey, I played in the college.
172056	172516	Can you see me?
174528	182215	and also, been away for a while, our correspondent from the People's Republic of Davis, Puppy.
182616	187160	Oh, and speaking of tardiness himself, here comes... Uh-oh, Fizz.
187460	188841	Who's this poking in the door?
189662	190883	Oh, my God!
191304	194567	I thought you said you weren't going to be here until 7.
195567	196368	Yes, you're late.
196548	197549	Introduce yourself, Dan.
199231	200112	Hi, everybody.
201621	202181	I'm late.
202242	204443	I'm sorry we're late, but we'll get into that later.
204463	205824	Oh my god, does that mean you're pregnant?
206325	206785	No, I'm not.
207426	208126	Not that kind of late.
213170	213570	Go eat.
213690	214891	So, yeah.
215372	216032	I don't have food.
216252	220716	We haven't eaten since Burger King at like noon, so I thought we were going to get food.
221416	222317	We didn't have time to stop.
222457	223018	You have cookies?
223798	224179	Cookies?
224699	225279	What kind of cookies?
225299	226640	Not yours.
226680	227181	Not yours.
228871	231392	By the way, everybody, well, you guys already met, but Jamie hasn't met.
231412	232312	Jamie, this is Joey.
233172	233812	Joey, Jamie.
234492	235553	Listeners, this is Joey.
236233	237033	Hey, how's it going?
237613	238213	Joey, listeners.
238333	241534	Okay, so we should take a break.
242694	243474	Yes, we should.
243654	246795	I think we should take that opening break that we usually do right about now.
246815	250496	We're going to start off this break with the first few MP3s I find.
255166	257748	So we've got, uh, looks like, um... Wait, here, here, here.
257888	258348	Hey!
258428	259088	Oh, you got it?
259349	259929	Yeah.
261430	265953	This is gonna be pretty much random stuff, so, uh... Yeah.
267554	269615	Anyways, um, yeah, enjoy.
316592	319774	I don't know, she was in the mood for talking
385615	386536	Thank you for watching!
515058	516559	Thanks for watching!
565364	565965	Thanks for watching!
602925	609250	Step Squad to Orange Lounge!
609450	613613	This DDR sucks!
613633	614333	Holler!
617415	622139	Hello everybody and welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 60 in progress.
623259	623920	I'm a little late.
623940	626122	I was a couple minutes late.
626642	627162	Sorry guys.
627903	628283	My bad.
628703	629424	Blame traffic.
633740	634300	You know what?
635581	638663	The traffic in... Nobody can hear you anyway, and that's a good thing.
639083	641444	The traffic in... Where the hell was that?
641464	642925	Where 680 meets... Fairfield.
643645	644506	Fairfield was horrible.
644566	651810	Because one guy crashes on the side of the road, and everybody has to turn their head and see if they can look at a dead body.
652730	653370	Never fails.
653450	654811	Oh, I think I see an arm!
655071	656432	Exactly, exactly.
657132	658233	It looks kind of severed.
659322	662444	I'm very proud of you guys getting things going anyway, though.
662704	666087	I mean, not that Jamie hasn't done it before, certainly, because remember, we took off for L.A.
666127	667708	for a couple times.
668068	673512	And although Loki picked me... And everyone decided to abandon me to go downstairs and watch the biography of Ron Jeremy.
675133	681497	And even though Loki picked the chicken dance for first break music, I forgive him anyway.
684099	684860	It was cute.
685300	687281	It was a nice deviation.
687441	691224	Yeah, it was a good deviation from a seven minute version of Kind Lady.
691244	697329	I mean, don't get me wrong, I love Kind Lady, but shit, there's only so much of that song I can take.
698830	700451	You just feel the disco groove.
701758	703420	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
724153	725234	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
743826	748029	I was on antibiotics all week, which had me not able to eat anything.
748869	755173	And then my inhaler that made me all shaky, and this other stuff that's like snorting like fire.
756874	757734	Tastes like burning.
758094	760176	It sucked.
760716	763197	It's like snorting vomit-flavored jelly bellies.
764178	765198	Like the Harry Potter ones.
765659	765799	Ew.
767180	768140	I think we still have some.
769121	769441	Uh, no.
770131	770931	Puppy!
771571	773592	Oh, puppy, let's try it.
773812	776112	This has been it for a month and a half.
778933	780533	For God's sake, we need to get those out of there.
783394	786174	But anyway, it was basically dull.
786314	789775	I came home feeling too tired, too sick to do much of anything.
790735	794716	And then, to top all that off, my car starts behaving very badly.
795836	797977	As in stopping every time I stop.
798017	799257	I'm going to be getting into my car later.
799932	807216	I kind of remember that because I remember when we were driving places doing that vroom vroom thing that my old car used to do.
807436	821883	But it was really doing it very badly and finally it does it at every stop so I decided Friday, I was going to take it in Saturday anyway to have it looked at but I just did it Friday afternoon because I was so tired of it and I went in on Saturday to a
824640	825401	Go check it out.
825621	828765	And apparently the compression is all messed up.
829265	830106	The one side is good.
830867	831828	The other side is good.
831908	835352	The middle is sunken on my engine.
835973	837475	Like at an incline, sunken.
838456	843461	So basically, here's the total cost of what I've spent on my car.
844560	847662	I have had, you know, little tiny things replaced.
848342	859908	I spent nearly $800 having the brakes fixed, catalytic converter put in, a new front axle, and then, not to mention, the oxygen sensor I had replaced much earlier.
860548	863610	And now they're saying it's going to cost $1,800 to fix my car.
865371	868112	And they likely need a new engine and a back-end rebuild.
868512	869192	Who'd you take it to?
869212	870073	I went to Meineke.
871144	871504	www.DarkSakura.com
887717	890499	You know, you should see, because remember Loki's story?
890720	893822	I don't know if this was last week, but you had the brake issue going on.
894503	895103	Oh, that was this one.
895123	895423	My bad.
895704	896845	I don't want to ruin the story then.
896925	900968	What we're going to do is we're just going to do a patch job on the engine and make it drivable.
901008	903670	But in the meantime, Julie's offered to let me use her car.
904111	904811	Oh, what a sweetheart.
905852	912658	Well, her old car, which went fine, but we tried to take off the dash last night to put in a fan switch because her old fan switch doesn't work.
913138	913919	And we just gave up.
913939	915220	We're like, we're going to let the men's do it.
915640	915820	So...
916781	919543	Dan and them were supposed to go over, but I couldn't get a hold of her all day.
922364	925486	Okay, normally when I hear, oh, you fucker, I look over and go, what?
927687	929067	Yeah, but it wasn't directed at you.
929148	929928	No, I don't mean me.
930008	930768	I was meaning what's without.
930788	931329	I'm just kidding.
932949	933990	Okay, you can shut up.
934050	934991	I'm not supposed to hear it at you.
936111	938392	Piece number 47 of 47 of Beatmania Complete Mix 2 was 68% done.
938472	939193	Now it's a 404 on the internet.
946482	948864	Might add that each piece is 50 megs in size.
950265	950565	Dough.
951005	951306	Dough.
952787	963575	Anyway, so my Saturday was composed of lots of... I went to Mimi's Cafe because I'd never eaten there before.
963595	964255	They were pretty good.
965436	966377	I bought a car battery.
967017	967638	Go to Sam's Club.
967658	968178	They're $47.
971841	972962	I bought the fan switch.
973542	974683	I bought a multi-tool.
974703	975784	I think it's in my pocket still.
976661	977641	I have a multi-tool.
977741	978862	I feel handy.
981963	982703	Hold my multi-tool up.
982723	983503	Put it on the camera for me.
984003	984323	Go up there.
985484	986964	No, like, stand with me and put it on the camera.
987084	987424	Geez.
988085	989405	Because I'm lazy and you're not.
990425	991326	That's my multi-tool.
991706	992346	It's really neat.
994667	996687	And it was $3.
997427	1000188	So that was the cheapest thing I bought all day.
1000348	1001749	And then we...
1003402	1005443	I went to TGI Fridays last night.
1006123	1009645	After Julie and I were in the middle of a massive game of Phantasy Star, I'm like, give me that.
1010125	1011265	Give me, give me my knife.
1012826	1021010	Yes, I am, I'm still into my Rite and Rock online, however, I am now back in the highly addictive world of PSO-pium.
1022250	1027472	You know, you chose to take your PSO break, like, right when I started playing, and now that I'm done with it.
1027552	1028673	I'm playing it on Xbox now.
1029153	1030734	I think you're avoiding me, is what it is.
1033303	1035424	I'm not avoiding you, Rob.
1035624	1036685	I'm going to go in here.
1038065	1038306	No.
1040006	1043328	But that's basically it, and I haven't heard anything about getting the Sentra today, so.
1044409	1046130	And I have to take the Tercel out again.
1046230	1049391	I'm very upset that the Vic Viper has finally crashed and burned.
1049811	1052773	I'm thinking of getting, sort of looking at an Echo.
1054374	1054994	An Echo.
1056275	1058716	They're blue, and if I get one, it's going to be the Twinbee.
1063675	1064535	I'm a nerd.
1065895	1067296	And I hadn't touched any Bimani all week.
1068936	1069557	Good for you.
1069857	1070477	End of story.
1072098	1074898	Because you always have to ask since technically we're supposed to be a Bimani show.
1075459	1079080	We worked some more on my message board today.
1080106	1081728	I'm going to give myself a shameless plug on this.
1081888	1083610	I was going to say, do you want to give yourself a shameless plug?
1083911	1087054	roleplay.darksakura.com Sign up there.
1087094	1090539	If you want to run a free form RPG on the message board, sign up.
1091400	1094263	I will set it up for you and make you a moderator of your own forum.
1095204	1096406	And if you want to discuss any...
1097347	1097827	Roleplays.
1098307	1104128	Coming soon, I'm going to be implementing MMORPG forum on there for Phantasy Star Online Ragnarok.
1104248	1107529	And I may even put a stupid little Puzzle Pirates on there.
1107869	1110450	You know what though, Jer's got a great Puzzle Pirates forum.
1110610	1111410	I'm still going to put one on.
1111510	1111830	Alright.
1113010	1118051	And I'm going to put one on for actual video games.
1118251	1122172	And yes, we're going to have the Battle Royale RPG discussion forum.
1123393	1127615	We could do a message board style one while we're working on the tabletop one, too.
1128916	1131036	I actually signed up for your message board the other day, finally.
1131537	1131937	Yay!
1131957	1136539	When you called and you wanted me to relay a message, it kind of reminded me, oh, I should go sign up for her board.
1137999	1139220	My boards are really awesome.
1139360	1139920	Sign up for them.
1139960	1145122	Everybody must or I'll steal your soul and feed it to my cat so that she can poop it in her litter box.
1146923	1147743	What a lovely thought.
1147783	1148164	Thank you.
1148584	1148964	I'm done.
1150464	1153086	Okay, then let's go on to Bradley.
1154667	1155308	Hello, by the way.
1155568	1155908	How are you?
1155928	1156649	I'm okay.
1157169	1157610	How was your week?
1157630	1158030	How was your day?
1159811	1160552	Pretty uneventful.
1160772	1161993	I'm looking for a job.
1165035	1167757	That's basically everything I did this week.
1168498	1173021	And then I went to QZAR yesterday, and we'll probably talk about it later with the group.
1174502	1176084	Yes, QZAR.
1176784	1178646	Loki or me is going to talk about QZAR in a minute here.
1178746	1179206	Don't worry about it.
1180653	1183934	I don't know if I did anything else interesting at all.
1186195	1188055	I only played one game of DDR and that was yesterday.
1192677	1195558	Oh, Jamie's... Jamie, you did that under my name.
1195618	1197058	Now I get all the credit for that kick.
1198578	1199299	I don't care.
1201199	1203220	Okay, you're always nice when you kick people.
1204140	1205240	Or you say something silly.
1205341	1206781	I'm just like, because you suck.
1207661	1209082	Or die or something.
1209142	1210142	So they know it's me anyway.
1212870	1213671	Anyway, okay.
1214051	1215812	I'm sorry to so rudely interrupt you.
1215832	1218793	It's not much to interrupt if I'm not saying much of anything.
1219734	1221595	Was there any interesting things you did this week?
1221655	1223516	Any Bomani accomplishments or anything?
1224096	1224236	No.
1224797	1224957	No?
1226417	1226858	It's all good.
1228619	1230460	Okay, well, moving on then.
1231180	1231500	Puppy?
1231780	1232941	I got a microphone again.
1233181	1233381	Yes.
1233501	1233781	Okay.
1233801	1235902	So what are we talking about again?
1236303	1236903	How was your week?
1236923	1237443	How was your day?
1237763	1239504	Oh, let's see.
1239624	1240485	For my week...
1243965	1256894	I didn't work this week because I was busy spending every single day packing all my stuff into large cardboard boxes so I can throw it in the back of a truck and drive up to Davis and move into my new apartment, which is actually pretty good.
1257314	1259295	Hooray for not being in the dorms anymore, huh?
1259335	1259595	Yes.
1259755	1264619	I remember when I moved out of the dorms in my own apartment, it was like, oh my god, life is great.
1264779	1265039	I know.
1265659	1270883	I actually have my car now, too, so I can, you know, leave whenever I need to.
1272103	1272884	And that's good.
1273240	1300847	and then uh I went to Scandia earlier today and tried to play 2DX but the damn figures at the right side has to be broken the damn key keeps like freaking out or something and then um I played like one game of DDR and got too tired haha old I know I'm getting old dammit it must be college
1302383	1303163	I don't want to go there.
1332910	1338212	I know what to do about camping, because I've been going camping at the same place for like 12 years, so I know the place.
1338233	1339313	Well, don't I feel like an ass?
1339353	1339753	I'm sorry.
1342194	1342955	Well, you should!
1346596	1351339	And now I'm watching Loki type something on the TV computer thing.
1351759	1354580	Any other exciting events you want to share about your week?
1357001	1358622	Pretty much before yesterday...
1360082	1362285	Oh, I did get to go to Ikea for the first time.
1362365	1363546	Ikea is so studly.
1364527	1365087	I love going to Ikea.
1365147	1366529	It's fucking scary, okay?
1366709	1367650	Why do you think Ikea is scary?
1367730	1369391	It's a big blue furniture Death Star.
1370232	1370913	That's what it is.
1371053	1372975	It's not a big blue furniture Death Star.
1373035	1374697	It is the cool.
1374837	1375758	I love Ikea.
1376078	1376979	Like, it's...
1379818	1383019	Okay, Ikea is beautiful because it's just everything in a box.
1383319	1389041	You can get a chair in a box, a lamp in a box, a recliner in a box, couch in a box, tea in a box.
1389181	1391802	Whatever you want, you can get it in a box, take it home, put it together.
1392462	1393082	But that's the problem.
1393102	1394723	You have to put the damn shit together.
1394743	1395603	It's like Legos.
1395723	1396904	Can't you read instructions?
1398584	1399645	What's to read?
1399785	1401285	It's in 12 different languages.
1401945	1402306	No.
1403486	1405447	I bought a desk and a dresser.
1407447	1409248	I'm going to Reno next Saturday, sorry.
1410768	1419796	Okay, well, I bought a desk and a dresser and a TV stand for my apartment, and now I spent all of Saturday putting that crap together.
1419996	1422538	There was not one word in the instructions.
1422718	1430385	It was some weird transgender-looking character pointing out things in pictograms.
1431786	1432867	It was weird.
1433107	1436690	It's like the Swedes are trying to, like, take us over.
1436871	1438412	For those who don't know, the Swedish on Ikea.
1440238	1442939	I don't think they have Ikea outside of California.
1442959	1443479	I could be wrong.
1443599	1445900	I thought there was Ikea outside of California.
1445920	1447041	Well, I mean, obviously in Sweden.
1447661	1447941	Is there?
1447961	1453103	There's actually one over in Schaumburg, Illinois, outside of Chicago.
1454103	1454463	Damn.
1455384	1458785	And the only reason why I know this is because I've got a couple of friends that live in Schaumburg.
1459225	1462366	And that Ikea blows the one in Emerville out of the water.
1462666	1464947	It is like seven stories tall.
1465367	1466808	Oh my God, that's so hot.
1466828	1467428	And it's freaking huge.
1469062	1471744	That IKEA place is so big.
1473286	1476508	Size is everything at IKEA, I just like to say.
1477109	1478090	Seven stories.
1478430	1479071	That's nuts.
1479671	1482233	Wow, I'm having to fan myself thinking about that.
1483214	1488659	Okay, but they need to learn that particle board is not the best material for furniture.
1490948	1501017	Okay, I put my dresser together at the helm of my roommate, and we tried to move it into my closet, and as we're lifting it up, snap, there goes a board on the front of the dresser.
1504008	1504608	Thank you for watching!
1524219	1547186	and we bought a chair that Navi had seen there like three months ago he really wanted so we bought it and then we all took it back to his house and put it together it was so much fun because you had to blow up these big like air bricks type things so we had to get out the thing that you use to inflate a tent it was so much yes because you would blow air in it and it was shaped like a brick kind of it was just a big brick you had to build it out of these air bricks
1548331	1562481	Yes, you built it out of air bricks, and then you put the cover, you put the bricks together, and then you cover it, you put the covering over it, like, it takes two of you to put the covering over it, and then you have this big air chair that's so much fun, like, I told him if he ever had sex in it, it would be fun, but anyway.
1563841	1566323	Okay, sex topic just went over my head.
1566343	1570586	Rocking, and a little bit of this is all falling over, or popping.
1572167	1573028	Don't rock this boat.
1574328	1577951	But still, I mean, particle board does not make good furniture, and they need to
1578456	1579136	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
1608936	1609496	I don't know.
1612737	1614197	I got all this stuff put together.
1614217	1615538	It's all about the watches.
1615898	1616978	Watches and clocks.
1619099	1622079	They're going to drive us insane by putting clocks everywhere.
1622099	1625380	Okay, that did not look right.
1625400	1626201	Did you ever see Hook?
1626741	1627181	Just like that.
1628781	1630222	That did not look right from this angle.
1632042	1633242	You're a sicko.
1634803	1635163	Whatever.
1636227	1637548	Yeah, too bad we're not on TV.
1637648	1637989	Anyway.
1638569	1639870	Oh, we do have the cam.
1639910	1640371	We have the cam.
1640411	1640751	I forgot.
1640791	1641612	And the cam updates even faster now.
1641632	1642933	Yeah, but it's not pointing in your direction.
1643354	1645596	Oh, I forgot to whore out our chat room.
1645696	1646036	My bad.
1646336	1646797	Do it then.
1647037	1647778	Did you guys already do it?
1647838	1648318	Do it.
1648478	1649099	Do it.

1661733	1665954	and sooner or later you guys are going to update that site, right?
1666634	1673676	We made a purchase this week, or last week I should say, and we're planning to put that purchase to use soon.
1673776	1675876	What kind of purchase would this be?
1676577	1677837	Swedish stock.
1678417	1679697	Yes, Swedish stock.
1680277	1681558	A Swedish bank account.
1682358	1682878	Okay.
1687358	1687778	I'll go back.
1687838	1688239	I'll go back.
1688379	1689460	I'll go back.
1714957	1722962	Last week went to Bodega Bay and there was about seven of us friends and we took a trip.
1723002	1725204	It's a yearly trip that we always go to Bodega Bay.
1725264	1730227	Ran out of house out there and stay, what is it, four days, three nights.
1730647	1731127	Really fun.
1731628	1740393	House is right on the ocean and so we just kick it there for, you know, the four days, three nights and drink up and party.
1742615	1749137	It's almost like that movie we saw, where they went to the cabin and partied.
1749397	1750678	You guys are a party animal.
1751058	1751878	Cabin fever.
1751918	1754179	Yes, we went and saw Cabin Fever two days ago.
1755059	1757860	Most disturbing film I think I've ever seen.
1757960	1759140	I don't get disturbed by movies.
1760501	1761861	I know, I'm not going to talk too much about it.
1762521	1762741	What?
1763081	1763682	What's his aunt?
1763702	1764982	It's the most disturbing film.
1766337	1769719	Okay, I'm sorry, second most disturbing film I've seen next to that.
1769759	1772901	That Ichi the Killer that Loki was talking about last week.
1773321	1775403	I'm sorry, that's too much.
1775483	1779385	I mean, if there's a line, that movie crossed it.
1779685	1783628	I don't know, we saw 28 Days Later yesterday and that was pretty disturbing too.
1783688	1785069	I like 28 Days Later though.
1785089	1785969	28 Days Later was a good movie.
1785989	1787210	By the way, it was a good movie, thanks.
1787230	1789631	No, no, no, no, no, no.
1790012	1791733	The most disturbing movie ever.
1793252	1795574	is freaking Manos the Hands of Fate.
1797796	1798236	You know what?
1798997	1801759	Even Suicide Circle, Battle Royale, not disturbing.
1802080	1805943	Suicide Circle, a little strange, but not disturbing.
1807904	1814730	It's creepy and thought-provoking, but not really disturbing unless you happen to have fixations about, you know, flesh.
1815331	1815391	No.
1816664	1817905	Well, there's Captain Fury for you.
1817945	1820808	A lot of flesh-tearing... Yeah, it was nasty.
1821188	1821869	It was pretty gruesome.
1821889	1823791	Tim Curry in Legend, disturbing.
1824331	1825352	Yeah, I'll agree with that.
1825372	1826073	But so great.
1827654	1829316	Anyway, sorry to interrupt.
1829876	1831838	Anyway, what else?
1831938	1833019	So that was that.
1833039	1833980	That was a cool trip.
1834080	1839605	Came back, didn't want to go back home, and that's why I took a day vacation.
1839645	1842148	Before my vacation and a day vacation after my vacation.
1842748	1843989	That's the way to do it.
1844149	1845790	Nobody ever wants to go back to work after vacation.
1871365	1872846	How are you talking about I don't work?
1872866	1873866	But you're back in school.
1874406	1875747	Well, I'm going to be working.
1876027	1876367	Where?
1876987	1877668	I don't know yet.
1877788	1879188	I still have to go out this weekend.
1879288	1880029	Oh.
1880329	1882810	But, like, right now, right this second, you're not working?
1883230	1883390	No.
1883870	1885651	But I am still employed at Golfland.
1886011	1887572	I am still on payroll at Golfland.
1889713	1890053	All right.
1890233	1890813	My bad.
1891193	1893494	And then you get to, later on, I'll deal with the whole thing.
1893595	1896716	And how you enjoy your job working at a Golfland, I'll never know.
1898360	1902244	It's not Roseville, especially after what happened to you this summer, which I want to talk about later.
1902284	1903545	Yes, I will talk about that later.
1903886	1908730	But it's not Roseville and there's not hundreds of thousands of snotty shithead kids to deal with.
1909531	1910392	And no water slides.
1912594	1914896	For the love of God, do not bring up each of the killer mid-show.
1915237	1916458	Oh no, please don't.
1919614	1920575	All I need... Yeah.
1920895	1923096	So I'll have to say yes, I do love my job.
1923136	1931201	I mean, I've been there for over nine years now, so... And I don't see myself going anywhere anytime soon, so... To be honest, I actually like my job a lot.
1931241	1935664	Like, four months ago, before I was promoted, I'd be complaining about it a lot.
1935684	1936585	But right now, love it.
1937185	1937565	I really do.
1938906	1940667	Looking forward to a fat pay increase.
1941848	1943789	Mine's busy now that peak season's almost over.
1943809	1946451	All you college students just need to hurry up and get in school and stop calling.
1951095	1954798	I can't really say that because I've talked to so many neat and cool people.
1955238	1959502	Your typical college student is smarter than your typical mortgage person.
1960162	1961023	Typical homeowner.
1961483	1961984	Really?
1963525	1964526	Let's go there.
1964746	1965527	Typical.
1966828	1968109	I, for one, am a homeowner.
1969944	1976286	I used to work in mortgage customer service and you have no idea how many people I had to explain how to read their loan documents.
1976406	1977066	It's not funny.
1977346	1978427	Well, it's, yeah.
1978747	1980027	I would say they are kind of complicated.
1980107	1981788	The smart people are the ones who don't call.
1981808	1986450	I've seen people who sign with an X.
1989371	1991272	Signing with an X, that's pretty bad
2017809	2018930	42 people at a time.
2019390	2024933	Put these nice pretty shiny collars on them and give them all a weapon and have them kill each other off in three days.
2024973	2025693	Electroshock.
2026454	2027414	Oh no, Battle Royale.
2027874	2029255	Have you seen Battle Royale?
2029695	2031136	No, I have not seen Battle Royale yet.
2034198	2034578	That's it.
2034638	2036919	Next time... Are you going to de-virginize me?
2037699	2045664	I'm going to bring... I'm going to bring over the DVD and have you watch it sometime.
2048889	2049990	Okay, Battle Royale real fast.
2050050	2053811	In case we have any new listeners, we'll run down the Battle Royale spiel again real fast.
2053831	2056792	In case we have any new listeners, because we're constantly bringing up Battle Royale on the show.
2057113	2057713	Battle Royale.
2058213	2059874	Japanese movie put out what?
2060194	2059874	99?
2060474	2062655	94.
2060494	2062655	Put out 94.
2062935	2064656	Oh, I don't think it's that old, dear.
2066116	2066296	Is it?
2066497	2067337	Well, whenever it was put out.
2068717	2069538	It's 2000, okay.
2070558	2072379	Regardless, it's not that old, is the point.
2072479	2086328	So it's not that old, and they put a bunch of students on an island, and when we say students, we're talking like 7th and 8th grade kids, 9th grade kids, and it's some kind of government program where they basically say, you guys have to kill each other, and the last one standing gets to go home.
2087288	2093472	And it's really violent, because, you know, it's not an American movie, so they're not subject to all the, you know, R rating stuff.
2094373	2096694	It had a theatrical release in Europe.
2097498	2098439	See, but the Brit is joking.
2098459	2100420	You can show tit on TV in Britain and no one cares.
2100941	2107086	But basically it's really violent and kids kill each other and it's great because kids get really annoying.
2107666	2108307	It's not censored.
2108347	2109148	There's no censorship.
2109708	2110329	Oh, hell no.
2114011	2117014	Oh, I mean, yeah, there's censorship in Japan, but the movie's not censored.
2117454	2121017	They're not going to show nudity when it's about seven and eight year olds.
2121157	2122338	Gratuitous violence, yes.
2123119	2123679	Nudity, no.
2123819	2124120	Gotcha.
2125154	2126135	I'm sorry, 7th and 8th graders.
2126195	2127395	I said 7th and 8th year olds, didn't I?
2127675	2128116	Yes, you did.
2131477	2133178	I like picturing them as junior high school kids.
2133478	2134539	Don't ruin my fantasy.
2136500	2137120	You're sick.
2137140	2138301	9th grade is high school here.
2138401	2139301	You're a sick man.
2139721	2140302	You know what?
2141442	2143083	Playing DDR as long as I have.
2144824	2146205	You get to hate kids real fast.
2149406	2150027	Anyway, hi.
2150427	2151187	I love those things.
2151747	2152228	Anything else?
2152268	2153888	Oh, don't encourage them.
2153989	2154589	Don't encourage them.
2157441	2157742	You know what?
2157782	2158542	I still love this thing.
2160224	2163968	Oh, yeah, baby.
2164389	2166952	I think I was bringing him all of a sudden.
2167472	2168193	Didn't you have to take a nap?
2168353	2170275	Actually, I am quite tired.
2170295	2171497	I've been driving all goddamn day.
2172662	2173602	Rob, you're on a timeout.
2173642	2174122	Go in the room.
2174282	2175263	Ooh!
2175283	2176043	Uh-oh.
2176283	2178463	I have the microphone!
2179143	2179623	You are cool.
2179643	2180323	You like the ferret.
2182524	2183244	He just sneezed.
2183284	2184444	I can't believe he just sneezed.
2184784	2188585	Rob is making the give me hand, trying to take the microphone away from me.
2189365	2190245	No, and look at me.
2190305	2191005	I'm on the floor.
2191346	2192306	Give me chair.
2192326	2193306	He's pouting.
2193346	2194086	Look at that lip.
2194266	2194866	My goodness.
2196607	2197447	Rob's being cute.
2197487	2198367	Okay, I have to give it back.
2199696	2200196	I win!
2203198	2205339	He got present with a ferret, and that was funny.
2205439	2206720	That was a flying ferret, though.
2207560	2211162	Those are... are... Special.
2211962	2212463	Special!
2212603	2216405	I thought... One of these was, like, long gone, and we couldn't find it.
2216625	2216905	Anyway.
2217745	2218105	It's right here.
2219326	2220627	Goodie.
2221367	2222608	Anything else you'd like to share about your week?
2222628	2223188	He's getting cold.
2224429	2225009	Ah, let me think.
2225509	2225649	No.
2226850	2226990	Okay.
2227010	2227090	Okay.
2228968	2231069	Uh, you want me to go or you want to go, Matt?
2232649	2233129	I can go.
2233550	2234690	Okay, my week and my day.
2235310	2236751	Um, well, my week is pretty cool.
2236811	2237811	I've had a great weekend.
2237831	2239932	I've had a really, like, long weekend, which is good.
2240192	2244793	Um, God, Friday night, uh, went over to Joey's and we watched a movie.
2245553	2250015	And, um, Saturday we went to Matt's birthday thingy at QSAR.
2250055	2250355	SAR.
2251255	2251776	Q-Stars
2270070	2271951	It's, it's, whatever, it just happens.
2273891	2276472	Joey said that he likes to go to the beach.
2276512	2279513	And I'm like, I haven't been to the beach in like a couple years.
2279573	2280753	So Joey was like, let's go today.
2281553	2282213	I'm like, okay.
2282633	2283734	So we went to the beach today.
2283794	2285334	We went over to Stinson Beach.
2285534	2287375	Stinson Beach over on Highway 1.
2287475	2290315	Which is right just north of San Francisco.
2290475	2293556	And you have to take the most windiest road to get there.
2293756	2294856	It's so fun to drive.
2295737	2296817	Luckily I didn't have to drive.
2298994	2300554	Oh, I was having fun.
2300894	2302815	He was holding on to the goddamn door.
2302835	2304855	I was not holding on to the goddamn door.
2305735	2307976	Did you master the inertia drift while driving?
2308716	2309656	The inertia drift.
2309916	2312137	You have to remember he hasn't played Initial D yet.
2312657	2312977	Yeah.
2313857	2314257	Okay.
2315978	2317318	Initial D is a racing game.
2318158	2319178	Oh, I love racing games.
2320319	2321199	I love racing games.
2321239	2322859	I'll bring Initial D over next Sunday then.
2322899	2323379	Cool.
2323799	2325440	I said it last week and I'll say it this week.
2325840	2326420	F, Initial D.
2327543	2329044	F-Zero's where it's at.
2329924	2330984	F-Zero's much better.
2333285	2334166	I know, I knew I would.
2334386	2334766	It's okay.
2336286	2336947	Um, okay.
2337367	2341508	So, uh, the Windy Roads, we went to the beach and the beach was fun.
2341548	2345810	We took about a gazillion pictures and there's, uh... Yeah, we did take a lot of pictures.
2345870	2350492	Thank you for taking all sorts of, like, disgusting pictures of me trying to climb the rock.
2350752	2353493	Oh, you guys will love this.
2354273	2356154	Thank you for watching!
2375046	2375807	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2397762	2398603	And he can't pass them.
2398623	2401244	Yeah, like five miles the whole trip.
2401724	2403586	And I'm like, there's passing lanes.
2404446	2405387	Turnouts, use them.
2406227	2407728	So we got stuck behind them.
2407748	2410690	Grandmas or grandpas listening out there, you know, turnouts, use them.
2411470	2419915	And not only did that slow us up, but then when we got to Vacaville or whatever that was, not Vacaville, Fairfield, there was all the traffic.
2421356	2423818	If it had not been for that traffic... It was only a fender bender, too.
2424795	2426877	It would not have been for that accident, we would have been here on time.
2426957	2431120	So for all those of you that get in car accidents, stop it and learn how to drive.
2433042	2441569	You know what's actually interesting is that a lot of the time it's not rubberneck drivers that cause the traffic to slow down.
2442170	2442630	Really?
2442831	2447715	Often the highway patrol actually sends out units to create traffic brakes.
2450006	2454188	It happened a couple days ago when I was on my way back from Ikea.
2454469	2456169	They probably do that on major accidents, right?
2456590	2463373	Actually, no, as I was going down 580 heading home from Ikea, there was a... I guess it was just like a...
2464648	2476733	Just a minor two-car accident on the right-hand shoulder right near a freeway entrance, and then two highway patrolmen busted ahead of traffic and created a traffic break.
2476793	2485537	It actually slowed down everyone to about 15 miles an hour as they passed the accident site, then pulled off the road and let everyone go.
2485597	2488998	Which makes sense, so the cleanup crew and everything can take care of it.
2489238	2491580	I've seen that happen twice in Sacramento, actually.
2491700	2493522	Same intersection, same time of day.
2493762	2500727	Like, we were coming back from the club, downtown, on the highway, coming back from downtown, same intersection, Fulton and 80.
2501208	2502409	I've seen two huge wrecks there.
2502429	2511356	And the policemen, they drive across all the lanes of traffic, and they do it really slow to pace the rest of the traffic, because you can't get by them, and you don't want to pass a cop anyway.
2512377	2513658	And he's driving across all the lanes of traffic.
2513938	2516020	That would be a great racing game.
2517868	2518929	Thanks, Car Driver.
2518949	2523292	Oh my God, that would be beautiful.
2524112	2525013	You can do it to your own beat.
2528140	2528620	That's funny.
2528680	2529981	VidPower is like, speed limit?
2530001	2530502	What's that?
2532603	2545173	Something that is posted on the highway that you're supposed to follow, but you notice that on the highways, it'll say maximum speed of 65 miles an hour.
2545333	2545553	Right.
2546193	2548855	But in the city, it has just speed limit, 35.
2549396	2549816	Speed limit, 40.
2549856	2551417	So it's not the max.
2551457	2555560	You can go 65 out of 40, but it's just not the maximum speed limit, you know?
2556341	2557442	Have you ever told that to a cop?
2558772	2559453	Actually, no.
2560294	2562256	What about where they have maximum and minimums?
2562356	2565098	I'd love for them to go after people who are not going the minimum.
2566920	2569242	You know, they pull over people going, you know, 50 into 65.
2569302	2569743	I mean, come on.
2571395	2573276	Joey and I were talking about this on the drive home today, too.
2573696	2578197	We decided that there needs to be a lane just for special people like us.
2578717	2579657	Screw the special people.
2579697	2580678	It should be Joey's lane.
2580698	2581038	Hello.
2581698	2584619	You know, I don't have to deal with these idiot morons that don't know how to drive.
2584759	2585479	You know what?
2585499	2589000	How about a lane that you have to pass an IQ test to be able to drive in?
2590589	2591490	Like, here's the test.
2591510	2592031	You know what?
2592231	2594213	The higher the IQ, the stupider they get.
2594253	2594973	I don't get it.
2595094	2605184	When you see an accident on the side of the road, do you A, stop to help, B, slow down to look at dead bodies, C, drive faster?
2605264	2605904	Go faster.
2606285	2609308	If you answered C, you get to drive in the special lane.
2609468	2609968	Oh, there you go.
2612150	2615491	Of course, you could just have, like, flying cars so you don't have to deal with highways.
2616332	2617352	That would be so much simpler.
2617632	2619313	Well, you know what... Thank you, George Jetson.
2621374	2627237	Being the profession that I am in, if I see something like that, I would have to actually call CHP to make sure somebody's on the way.
2629137	2630478	Aww, you're a good Samaritan.
2630538	2631218	I wouldn't stop and help.
2631238	2633659	You can do it from your cell phone while you're driving, cut a mouse faster.
2633699	2634680	I would have to call CHP.
2637301	2637781	That's just me.
2641203	2641443	Okay.
2643034	2648038	I think that's all I want to say, because we'll talk about QSAR later, I'm sure Loki might get into it or whatever.
2648098	2651721	We need to take a break before we talk about that, but Loki, do you want to talk about your week, your day?
2652882	2656244	Well, sure, why not, you know, since I'm just sitting here.
2657185	2664871	Um, let's see, this week wasn't all that important, you know, it wasn't like I had my birthday or anything, and, uh, yeah, I'm 23.
2665231	2664871	23?
2666212	2667813	No one died except for John Reeder.
2667973	2668614	I clean.
2668794	2669854	Oh, my goodness.
2671479	2672684	Yeah, but I didn't kill Giant Cash.
2672844	2673788	John Ritter, though, was me.
2674470	2675574	There you go.
2676578	2677060	Oh, man.
2678186	2680508	Johnny Cash, he had one foot in the grave anyway.
2680568	2681768	I mean, when his wife died.
2682369	2685411	Hey, hey, you know, I was really depressed.
2685751	2687492	And I normally don't get depressed for famous people.
2688053	2688773	Don't get me wrong.
2688873	2690914	Johnny Cash, great man, talented man.
2691515	2693436	But his wife died four months ago.
2693776	2695718	He's been having all sorts of problems anyway.
2695798	2697819	I mean, bless him for trying to keep going on.
2697899	2700241	But it's the same thing happened with my grandma and my grandpa.
2700261	2701001	It's just too hard.
2701021	2702102	Your spouse goes, you're next.
2702162	2703503	You get sick often.
2704083	2706885	This is what happened with my aunt.
2707409	2712194	When her father died, her mother passed within six hours of him.
2713075	2713996	And she was in perfect health.
2715198	2719543	So, I guess, you know, I'm glad that they're all, you know, united again.
2719583	2720584	But it was very depressing.
2720604	2721044	Anyway, I'm sorry.
2721084	2721565	Happy birthday.
2722306	2727511	So what you're saying is Johnny Cash was so distraught over the fact that John Ritter died that he too...
2730201	2731001	I don't know about that.
2731782	2732202	Don't know.
2732442	2735883	Anyways, um, so yeah, I didn't do too much this week.
2736223	2738744	I took two days off, so I had a four day weekend.
2739464	2747167	And, um, Thursday I went and got my breaks done, took it over to the mechanic that happens to be just like a few feet from our door.
2748027	2749687	Like literally right over the fence.
2750128	2750628	And, um...
2751548	2760015	So I took it over there, and I found out that, you know, I got my brakes done, it didn't need to really be done, but I went ahead and did the back brakes, because it was kind of a birthday gift for my mom.
2760555	2768501	But, um, so, found out that, like, Speedy Oil Change lied about, you know, my brakes needing to be done, they just wanted more service for me.
2768521	2775647	You know what, I have, that, just Speedy in general, or any kind of those quickie lubes, don't go.
2776894	2777675	That's all I have to say.
2777695	2779496	Well, and they broke my axle.
2779616	2779856	See?
2779916	2780696	Hello?
2780736	2784699	They damaged my axle so that I'd have to come back and have it replaced there too.
2786800	2790403	Well, I can't prove that they did break it, but I think they broke it a little bit more.
2790723	2802250	Because right after I got my tune up there, my car started grinding when I turned right, which is from my right front axle going out.
2802891	2806073	But that's not going to cost that much to replace, so that's cool.
2808069	2809529	and they're working my pads some more.
2809769	2811150	I have them all framed now.
2811290	2811950	They're all pretty.
2812830	2816391	And... Yes, they're sitting on the patio.
2816811	2826973	And yesterday, or no, Friday, I went and bought a TV, a 27-inch TV that I'll be using in my cabinet.
2827553	2833214	And let me just say that was the most entertaining thing to watch for anyone else that was out there in that parking lot.
2833494	2834734	Me trying to get that in my car.
2836084	2856591	It wouldn't fit in the back door, it wouldn't fit in the trunk, so I ended up having to break the box open, cram the TV into the front seat, pad it with the phone that was inside there, strap the seatbelt around it, and hope to God that when I turn corners that it doesn't crush me when it rolls, so that was fun.
2857111	2862433	Oh, and then getting it in the door as the neighbors are standing there watching me go, oh, it's so heavy!
2864167	2889576	and then, um, so I did that, and then, um, what else, um, oh yeah, then yesterday we went and played QZAR and I kicked ass and won every game, as usual, and there's some guy there that called me fat, and I laughed at him, that was so great, Boki's like, that guy called me fat, and it was the guy that worked there, and
2891471	2901415	He was just pissed off that I was beating up on him But we ended up tying and we shook hands at the end That's all what it's about, you know, just talking What are you talking about?
2901555	2918461	Cues are, that's what you do, you talk That's gay You talk shit all the time and at the very end, you know, you just thank them for a good game Because that's what it is Because the next game, you know, they could be whooping up on you And the game after that, you could be whooping on them You never know, it's just a different situation each time, so What?
2919802	2924465	I just don't talk to anybody and then I sneak up on them and poke my gun in their back and then fire and run away giggling.
2925866	2938493	Well then we started doing genius stuff because the arena isn't built that well so the red headquarters, they didn't paint it too well and so we were tagging the headquarters from outside the headquarters because the plexiglass wasn't covered all the way.
2938613	2939013	Lame.
2939273	2942915	Let me just say, being on the team that was defeated by you, lame.
2942935	2944556	Cheat.
2944596	2945076	Cheat.
2946397	2948919	We're bouncing shots off the windows and stuff like that.
2948999	2951661	I'll be on the other side of the arena, see the lights on the windows.
2952822	2953563	Great stuff.
2953963	2954704	So we did that.
2954744	2955324	We had fun.
2955364	2956405	Played some Cusar.
2956445	2960789	Dropped some business cards off there.
2960849	2964292	So hopefully someone picked them up as listening to the show tonight, even though I don't think so.
2964372	2966894	And that's it.
2966934	2968475	And there was no Hicks there.
2968875	2969536	I was surprised.
2969716	2970477	No Hicks at all.
2970597	2973079	It was like they knew we were coming and fled.
2974761	2974881	Uh oh.
3006458	3012925	uh oh I missed all that anyways moving on yeah
3019424	3039385	Oh well, anyways, um, so then later on, um, yeah, we left, and then, um, I came back here and I was exhausted, and today I bought everything to convert all of our game systems over to S-Video, and I bought a bunch of, I raped Radio Shack's, um, little component cabinet, and I took all their, um, um,
3040686	3043228	I want to talk a little more about QZAR when we come back.
3043268	3043668	Not now.
3067165	3068126	Because it's time for a break.
3068146	3070690	We've been talking for like 40 minutes straight here, so we're going to take a break.
3071050	3071270	Okay.
3071491	3071711	Fine.
3071771	3072312	Because I said so.
3073073	3073633	And I want to stretch.
3073814	3076417	So, we will be right back.
3076717	3078139	You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
3078179	3078520	Thank you.
3159461	3160546	Thanks for watching!

3285658	3304916	In the far real, you've gotta learn how to survive Cause you never know where it's your turn to take a dive So you go, you stay with your eyes in the back of your head You never know if you'll be alive or be dead
3308007	3308968	Thanks for watching!
3348482	3349743	Orange Lounge Radio.
3350063	3352224	We put your thing down, flip it, and reverse it.
3353065	3359709	Hey, we're back.
3360389	3361029	Hi, everybody.
3362810	3364051	Yay, I'm in the chair.
3365272	3369154	I did it all by myself.
3369174	3370235	I have the ferret, too.
3371595	3372336	So what are we going to do?
3372356	3373216	I don't know.
3373576	3374217	Give the microphone a rub.
3374676	3378917	Well, I want, because somebody in the chat room was asking over break, what is QSAR?
3379617	3394580	Actually, the place is QZAR, and it's with a Z, and it's laser tag, but the reason why we've been calling it QSAR tonight is because on our little receipts yesterday when we bought the games, it said QSAR, and we were joking, QSAR, you know, shit like that.
3396861	3398341	But, what?
3399261	3400842	Well, British was Quasar, wasn't it?
3400882	3401782	Did you call Quasar in Britain?
3401802	3401882	Yeah.
3404662	3406263	Jimmy's like, I'm not that big a dork, okay?
3408223	3409283	But I actually, you know what?
3409763	3416405	I was talking about how much I suck at QZAR, and Loki told me I had to shut up, because I actually did pretty good.
3416505	3418345	One game I came in second, just behind Loki.
3418545	3419065	I was happy.
3420125	3428007	It was a solo game, too, because I just stood by the headquarters, and every time Loki would shoot enough people that he could go for the headquarters, I'd be there to jump out and shoot him.
3429335	3432877	I got the headquarters like three times, or almost three times.
3432937	3436258	I got it twice, and then I got tagged by Ryan at the very end.
3437859	3444722	I was tagged, and the light was up, because Black Lab was trying to shoot it even... What?
3445102	3446683	This chat needs to be scrolled down, sorry.
3447183	3447843	Oh.
3453766	3454726	Sorry to interrupt your story.
3454786	3455167	Keep going.
3455667	3455927	My bad.
3458052	3472217	Alright, anyways, um, so yeah, I was gonna tag him the second time, but Puppy didn't understand, I guess, the concept of, um, Super Charge, where you have to tag five people without getting tagged, and your gun goes into rapid fire, then you can tag the headquarters, that's the only way you can tag it.
3472437	3487223	So he's standing there blocking me, because I'm trying to, like, tag the headquarters, and here he's standing there, had I remembered that you can tag it from the outside, you know, that would've saved me a whole lot more time, but, you know, um, so no, I had to, like, you know, kind of
3488328	3489810	Get tagged a few times, but then I won.
3490590	3490810	Again.
3492292	3507786	But, um, what was it, um, there was like some, like, tubby little kid there that was, um, you know, talking crap, and I beat him down, and then, then I was playing DDR later on, and he's like, oh my god, you're good at QZR and DDR!
3510004	3537534	I was not there, that's funny Yeah, even I would have made fun of that That's cool See, it wasn't as bad as Skater Cowboy Oh my god, Skater Cowboy is awful Skater Cowboy was there last night, I would have laughed We always think about Skater Cowboy when we think of Vacaville I wasn't even there Seriously, every time I go to Vacaville, I look for Skater Cowboy But I don't think we'll ever meet him again
3538598	3540499	He's just rolling in the wind.
3541719	3547841	With his cool custom made DDR Freak skateboard that sucked.
3548741	3552402	Jamie, do you know if DDR Freak has any officially licensed skateboarding products?
3552962	3553502	Hell no.
3554563	3555183	Just checking.
3557784	3561765	I think the only official DDR Freak product there is are like the shirts and then that's it.
3563120	3564161	I thought there were stickers, too.
3564601	3565121	Maybe stickers.
3565141	3565361	Maybe.
3565421	3569143	Well, this one was a hand-carved skateboard.
3569864	3570884	That was so awful.
3571064	3572245	When you're a freak, you're a freak.
3574106	3575186	What's a syringe?
3577928	3582310	You know, I... I just hadn't been to play in so long.
3582370	3583571	It's just like I kind of forgot...
3585453	3586054	What it was like.
3586074	3588796	But those energizers kind of sucked for me.
3588856	3590878	Like, I could never get my gun to energize right.
3591158	3595361	And I don't know if it was just that I would keep shaking my gun in front of it when you have to hold it.
3595422	3597363	But even when I held it, it wouldn't do anything.
3598304	3598804	It was stupid.
3599125	3599585	I didn't like that.
3600266	3601266	Yes, I am very impatient.
3602407	3606311	But it sucks we have to go all the way to Vacaville to play QZAR because Laser Force is unacceptable.
3606771	3607732	That's not a laser tag.
3607812	3610494	It still exists?
3610534	3611956	Believe it or not, we just drove by it the other day.
3611976	3613417	I'm like, why is that place still open?
3615126	3616007	It smells like pee.
3616027	3620450	You have to understand because they're the number one Laser Force play since Cusar left.
3620630	3621671	They were about to go under.
3621691	3623233	They're the only Laser Force.
3623973	3627616	Imagine, well, Laser X is a count, but imagine if we will.
3627836	3631339	Okay, Sunsplash is about on the same level as Laser Force.
3631359	3635983	We're talking like, you know, Laser Force was in the quicksand.
3636713	3648282	Goin' Under, No Chance of Survival Whatsoever No Chance to Survive, Make Your Time Yeah, then all of a sudden, you know, Q's are leaves, and Gas for Air, and it's like, barely alive
3649144	3650766	And it comes back with a vengeance.
3650806	3654951	The only thing I like about Laser Force is I love the two-story arena concept.
3655051	3657333	I love... Because you know I love to play sniper.
3657734	3660757	So I love to sit there on the top and pelt people at the bottom.
3661358	3662940	Yes, I'm a camper and I'm proud of it.
3663761	3667605	I wish we could go play QZAR in Ireland because their Irish rules rock.
3668366	3669947	Irish Rules... Can you club people with a gun?
3670228	3671909	Can you drink and then play Cusar?
3672429	3675992	Irish Rules, there's no neck strap, and there's running.
3676152	3680455	Their arenas are huge, and it's like running around in a huge... It's pretty much like playing paintball.
3681376	3686180	Because it's just that... It's just crazy, and it's the most tiring thing ever.
3686200	3694666	We played Irish Rules one time when I was there on Tuesday night at that Cusar in Vacaville, and that was very dangerous, and...
3696665	3697926	Whoa, what a liability.
3698006	3699947	How did you get away with doing Irish rules there?
3700387	3702568	Well, gee, because they don't have any waiver cards.
3702668	3703848	It doesn't matter anyways.
3704389	3707990	That QZAR's run so poorly, it's just... It's a joke.
3708050	3713132	If anyone got hurt at all, like stubbed a toe or whatever, you could just go and sue that place and it wouldn't matter.
3713653	3714833	Hey, kids!
3715193	3716394	Hey, kids, wanna make money?
3717834	3723657	Seriously, there's no waiver forms at all, so... I mean, you could...
3724924	3730709	I should do that so I can pay my college fees.
3743976	3745897	The show just kind of came to a screeching halt.
3746558	3752640	Sorry, I just saw that my Beat Mania Complete Mix 2 was done.
3752781	3753721	Oh, aren't you special.
3754101	3755262	You want to do the cage match now, Jamie?
3756362	3757363	Yeah, I want to do the cage match.
3757403	3759164	Alright, let me get over there and I'll set up a cage match.
3759184	3760224	Alright.
3760284	3762005	Here, Loki, talk.
3764011	3772814	So yeah, today, or actually not today, a few days ago, they finally released the hard drive image of Beat Me A Complete Mix 2.
3774174	3775134	And that was pretty cool.
3777215	3777875	Bad puppy.
3778976	3779776	Bad puppy.
3780556	3785818	So anyways, yeah, I just downloaded it, all 47 parts of it, and now it's going to unzip.
3787098	3787898	Very slowly.
3788639	3789419	It's going to take a while.
3792518	3794339	So, yeah.
3795380	3797761	Um, I put more posters up today.
3798241	3803004	I put the Excel Saga is Yummy, and I put the, uh, Anime Pinup Babes.
3806226	3806446	Yes.
3809568	3816512	But then the Anime Pinup Babes, I wanted to get the one, they have a few other, like, babes on that poster, I wanted to get a different poster with them on it.
3818187	3821308	To make this room complete, you need a Transformers poster, so I'm going to have to get you one.
3821908	3823349	Hell yeah.
3823369	3823489	Okay.
3826030	3828450	But, um... I still have some, actually.
3829911	3830291	Oh, okay.
3830791	3832132	We're talking about Transformers.
3832892	3834452	And, uh... Transformers.
3834572	3836613	I still have some, actually, back in the day.
3839154	3839274	Uh...
3844535	3851917	A big announcement, go to your local GameStop and reserve your Season 3 Transformers box set now so you can be cool like me.
3853417	3854617	Because I have mine reserved.
3854677	3855357	That's awesome.
3855417	3856978	Season 3 is the best season ever.
3857478	3858558	So awesome.
3859818	3862499	We all aspire to be as cool as Jamie, don't we?
3862919	3865239	Everybody in the world needs to be as cool as me.
3865859	3869880	You know what, I just met Jamie and Jamie is the coolest chick I've ever met, so hey.
3871178	3872800	Yeah, I'm cool.
3872820	3873620	I have a spirit.
3876543	3880567	I sent you a RAR file, 0preshow.rar.
3884090	3888294	Because I was cool and decided to upload it so I didn't have to waste any more CDs.
3893098	3894980	I endorse WinRAR, not WinZip.
3896381	3896781	I have it.
3897062	3897242	Here.
3903737	3908262	Hello, that music means it's time for a cage match.
3908542	3912105	I'm wrapping Loki up in court, it's fun.
3912145	3917631	Anyway, the way the cage match works, if you win the white, you can't vote for Holic, that's the first rule.
3919052	3926600	Second rule, if you want to vote in the cage match, you have to get in our chat room, www.tallybomani.com, click on Orange Lounge and click on chat, this is the way it works.
3927100	3932944	Each of the three lovely hosts of this program, including myself, DarkSakura, and Loki, bring one song to the table.
3933745	3938969	And you guys vote on your favorite song, and that song goes into rotation all week long on Orange Lounge Radio.
3939349	3943232	However, if a song wins for a month straight, it gets taken out.
3944533	3945354	And guess what?
3946895	3947896	I'm a little scared.
3949770	3953611	And last week's song that won is now halfway there.
3954152	3957853	Last week's winner was Loki's song that he picked two weeks ago, but it's still winning.
3958453	3964195	And it's Every Little Thing from the Cybertrans album with Face the Change.
3964995	3968336	And this is the Above and Beyond and Dirt Devils remix.
3969477	3973478	So you only get a clip of it because it won last week, but this is song number one you can vote for tonight.
3973618	3975219	Every Little Thing with Face the Changes.
3975879	3976219	Here you go.
4013378	4014159	Thank you for watching!
4040251	4041272	Thank you for watching.
4041312	4042332	See you next time.
4079096	4079916	Okay, hi.
4079936	4081837	That was last week's winner.
4081957	4082838	Two weeks running now.
4082918	4085879	Every little thing on the Cybertrans album will face the change.
4087239	4090041	Next up, Jamie, you want to do yours next or you want me to do mine?
4090481	4091901	You want to do yours?
4092362	4095343	Alright.
4095863	4097944	Mine is one of the Overclocked remixes.
4098004	4100425	I don't remember who did it or what it's called, but it's from Ryden.
4101457	4103819	which is one of the best shooting games ever.
4104099	4107082	I can fill you in on the rest of it because I can read it right off the mp3 here.
4107482	4110344	It's Gallantry, Nobility of Spirit.
4111365	4111925	That's what it says.
4112326	4115568	And if you have never played Raiden, go play Raiden DX because it's the best of the series.
4116069	4116389	Thank you.
4116789	4118251	Alright, so here's Jamie's pick.
4118491	4121453	It's Ryza with Raiden Gallantry.
4121873	4122154	Enjoy.
4200676	4201500	Thanks for watching!
4239003	4239625	Thanks for watching!
4419811	4420712	Okay, we're back.
4420752	4423313	That was Ryza with Raiden Gallantry.
4423333	4434361	That was DarkSakura's pick for the cage match this week, and now we get to tear it apart or praise it lots, whatever you want to do.
4434381	4437883	It was a really good remix, and the song that I initially picked had already been played.
4438644	4442067	because I didn't notice the track listing, I just went, oh, this is from Wipeout, and put it in.
4442908	4443708	I didn't even listen to it.
4445990	4457480	So, this one, this one, I liked it, it's a good remix, and it's a great game, you know, I've always been a big fan of the Raiden series, and figured a lot of people don't appreciate it that much, so I threw it in, so it gets an 8 for me.
4459782	4460323	Uh, Loki.
4462284	4465147	Um, it was okay, but it was,
4468032	4479390	I give it an 8 also because it wasn't a speed mix and it wasn't annoying.
4482526	4484087	I pretty much agree with Loki.
4484247	4487110	It was good, but it was kind of easy to tune out.
4487310	4490332	But it's good video game music, so I'll give it that.
4490692	4492754	And Raiden is an underrated shooter, so I'll give you that too.
4493134	4496797	But as a song itself, I can't see giving it much more than a 6.66.
4508168	4509268	I forgot to listen to it.
4531155	4532336	Somebody else take a mic here.
4532756	4533837	Look at this loser.
4534217	4534977	Look at this guy.
4534997	4536478	He's so stupid.
4537038	4538039	Stupid guy.
4538059	4539019	What the hell?
4539420	4541081	What are you doing?
4541661	4542001	Damn it.
4542341	4542761	What am I?
4542922	4548985	I feel like a mobster from Dick Tracy or something with his cord wrapping around me.
4549265	4551446	He ain't going nowhere until you spill.
4551987	4552587	Spill.
4552867	4553207	Oh.
4554668	4556649	No, I think... Oh.
4557270	4557530	Okay.
4557790	4558190	Switching!
4560632	4560912	Okay.
4563193	4564054	You dropped it!
4564454	4566655	Yeah, but you stepped on the cord when you threw it.
4567336	4568737	Hi, Cage Match, remember me?
4568917	4569377	Oh, yeah!
4570738	4579503	Um... Yeah, the song was... It was okay, but... I was kind of falling asleep to it, almost.
4580284	4583986	I mean, if I wanted to fall asleep to the music, that'd be good, but I...
4585160	4585980	I'd give it about a 7.
4586160	4592402	And I think that's it.
4593762	4601684	I'd like to take this moment to tell all of you people to learn how to pay attention.
4602124	4609926	I'd like to mention that the Race Space R6 MK3 is the most gay racing chair I've ever seen.
4611006	4613787	I can vouch for Loki, he does have ADHD.
4614895	4617036	Hi, I'd like to finish Cage Venture, thank you.
4617116	4618637	I haven't too, but I never took anything.
4619218	4619518	Alright.
4619858	4620618	That would explain it.
4621799	4622279	Take this.
4622880	4624881	My turn, my song's turn.
4626142	4631905	Actually, I didn't really have time this weekend to really pick a song I really wanted to do or anything.
4632386	4634467	So, usually there's like...
4635669	4640412	I get sent like five songs a week from our chat room going, you should use this song, you should use this song.
4641093	4648538	And, you know, I obviously don't have time to fit them all in, but I'm going to go ahead and do this one the angel sent me, because it's pretty good, I like it.
4649258	4650659	So, what the hell.
4651159	4653461	Here it is, this is Froggy with Coming to My Dream.
4653481	4655823	I actually like this song, so I'm okay with picking this.
4655843	4656343	So here we go.
4657103	4657604	This is my pick.
4696399	4698039	Thank you for watching!
4828019	4837783	I'm into my dream Let me show you where I've been It's you and me I've seen Let me tell you what I mean In the deep blue sky
4858462	4859543	Thank you for watching!
4931024	4933586	Hello, that was Froggy with Coming to My Dream.
4933626	4933906	Jamie?
4934786	4942651	Um, it wasn't bad, but it sounded very, I guess, cookie cutter, you know?
4943532	4948615	The little pauses where it did the little vroom vroom noise were kind of cool before it set up again.
4949316	4953238	But it's not anything that I could really latch onto and concentrate on.
4953879	4956781	So it gets about a 7, yeah.
4956801	4958081	7 points.
4959062	4959702	Alrighty.
4960023	4960283	Loki!
4963740	4966282	I've heard that song so many times, it's not even funny.
4968464	4972847	But it has froggy in it, so I was expecting swimming music, and that's what it was.
4973348	4974429	Music had me swimming.
4976070	4977011	Into boredom!
4980213	4987819	Now, I was kind of tuning that one out, too, because I've heard it so many times, but I was busy, you know, with renaming zip files and stuff.
4988900	4991943	You and that massive porn book!
4993922	4995724	Yeah, but this isn't about the porn collection.
4995764	4996925	This is about Beatmania.
4997145	4997446	Okay.
4997786	4999227	No, it was okay.
4999367	5000308	It was a pretty good song.
5000409	5006655	In fact, I think it's better than my song this week, which you should vote out, because I have a better one for next week.
5008577	5008857	Or not.
5008877	5010699	Just vote for Loki, since it's the best one.
5012725	5013885	Chicken Dance, yeah, for Chicken Dance.
5015426	5017547	Uh, rule number one, can't vote for Holic, sorry.
5019528	5023970	You can, however, vote for Pixie Dust's hot Kylie Minogue brand underpants, if you want.
5024070	5024510	I'm just kidding.
5024750	5025330	It's a joke!
5025410	5026671	I checked, that wasn't a music.
5026691	5027651	Chatroom joke, sorry.
5029672	5030732	Oh, yeah, Froggy, anyway.
5031092	5032033	Um, it's a cool song.
5032293	5035714	It's a little bit repetitive to me, but aren't most songs like that repetitive?
5036555	5038375	Um, so I give it a, uh, eight.
5038555	5039236	I give it an eight.
5039456	5040116	I give it an eight.
5040336	5040936	I give it an eight.
5041136	5041216	Ow!
5043228	5044889	No, I actually do like that song a lot.
5046249	5047249	I was about to throw the mic at you.
5048230	5049410	Did you actually listen to this one?
5052931	5053291	I give it a 6.5.
5053371	5061774	It was a little repetitive, but it was alright.
5062034	5062354	Puppy.
5064355	5064775	Snore.
5064795	5064775	4.
5065375	5065696	Bradley.
5065716	5069077	I thought it was pretty good.
5069097	5069497	I gave it 7.5.
5072182	5073463	Did you like comment on this one, Joey?
5073603	5074344	Yes, I think I will.
5074924	5077846	I was listening to that song, and I kind of liked it.
5078107	5084912	It was slow in the beginning, but it kept... I mean, I haven't heard many, many, many songs like it, but I thought I liked it.
5085012	5088194	So, I will have to say a seven.
5089035	5089335	All right.
5089896	5090296	Sounds good.
5090816	5092177	Okay, let's recap, kids.
5092217	5092778	Here you go.
5092878	5095200	Send those votes now to Sky.
5095260	5096601	I just have one more comment on that song.
5096721	5097001	Okay.
5097121	5097962	I memorized the lyrics.
5100802	5101883	I'm so proud of you.
5106104	5110726	Some days, I want to beat you over the head with that ferret repeatedly.
5121351	5122372	Here we go, let's recap.
5122392	5123932	You can vote for one of these three songs.
5123972	5128034	Song number one, two weeks running now, Every Little Thing, Cybertrans, Face the Change.
5130905	5132526	Wow, that's a horrible clip from that song to play.
5132586	5134748	Let me try a different... That was like an electronic fart.
5134768	5135629	Let me try a different part.
5141333	5141754	Good enough.
5141874	5142094	All right.
5142114	5143435	Tell my words, ghost mix.
5143775	5147138	Song number two you can vote for, Ryza with Ryden Gallantly.
5156192	5159375	Song number three you can vote for tonight, Froggy with Come Into My Dream.
5159715	5161156	Jamie, you remember the lyrics to this one?
5162437	5162578	Ew.
5163138	5163939	Never mind, here you go.
5164239	5165920	Come into my dream, bitches!
5169103	5170444	That's kind of a shitty clip, too.
5171805	5172266	Much better.
5172546	5174187	Right now I feel like Sandstorm.
5177610	5178591	Rave!
5179072	5182595	And in great bonsai tradition, place votes now!
5183564	5184285	Yeah, bitches.
5185025	5187127	Oh, yeah, Banzai got cancelled.
5187467	5188428	Did Banzai get cancelled?
5189088	5189869	It had to have.
5189909	5190690	It had to have.
5190710	5191210	You know what?
5191410	5191891	I don't care.
5195653	5196274	I'm sorry, puppy.
5196314	5196995	Nobody can hear you.
5197015	5200217	Hey, is Takeshi's Castle still on?
5200237	5200637	What was it?
5200657	5201838	Most Extreme Challenge?
5203159	5205141	Yes, Most Extreme Challenge is still on.
5206002	5209745	I think I can find, like, original episodes, though, of Takeshi's Castle.
5209765	5210745	I want to find those.
5211346	5212226	I want to find those.
5213522	5221972	Just from some of the clips they take out for the Hacked Up show, there must be some really incredibly stupid people in that show.
5222973	5227559	My favorite clip is the one time that one chick took a soccer ball into the face.
5227579	5228600	I like you.
5229677	5233600	No, I like Japanese variety shows.
5233740	5235021	I have a tape somewhere in my house.
5235821	5240505	By the way, this is the first time I had ever seen any Dragon Ball Z. It was taped off of TV in Japan.
5240965	5242486	I had Macross 7 on the tape.
5242806	5244768	That's giving you an indication of how old this tape is.
5245388	5247410	They had this show on a cloud.
5247650	5248750	I don't remember what it was called.
5248771	5250712	It was called Uri Nari Land or something.
5251152	5256016	But they had these interviews and stuff, and then they had dog soccer.
5256696	5258358	And then they showed a repeat of it.
5258398	5259859	And then they had sit replay.
5259879	5260760	The dog like squat down, poop.
5260820	5262883	And then they had a cow, trying to lead the cow.
5279681	5281863	I could totally make a Japanese TV.
5282043	5285327	They just need to let me have, like, no rules whatsoever.
5285747	5286868	Just let me do it.
5287049	5288150	Calvin Ball the show.
5289531	5290933	They need Calvin Ball the show.
5291533	5292514	Calvin Ball the show.
5292534	5293195	Calvin and Hobbes.
5293215	5294236	There is no rules.
5295237	5299242	But, no, they were trying to get a cowgirl, so then they had a baby dressed up as a soccer ball.
5300430	5304491	It was wearing this little black and white checked outfit with a little hat that looked like a soccer ball.
5305251	5309732	And this baby's like, the thing is, this baby was so cute.
5309932	5313333	Because the baby would just sit there, and then people would wave stuff, and the baby would just laugh at them.
5314114	5316034	And then go try to wander out of bounds.
5316694	5321495	And then they were wiggling things, and the baby was going, and started, you know, crawling across.
5321535	5322076	It was pretty funny.
5322896	5323656	I'll try to find my tape.
5325197	5330378	I've also got an interview with Jackie Chan on there, and then I made for a TV movie with him on it, so it was cool.
5330978	5332238	Jackie Chan rocks.
5332678	5336859	And I have the best Godzilla movie ever because of the man with the CD player in his head.
5338419	5340320	Godzilla vs. Mechagidra.
5341760	5343400	Because the man had a CD player in his head.
5345521	5345821	Wow.
5347061	5351942	It's like, he's this android guy, and he's the only one who speaks English in the whole movie, it's great.
5353012	5354193	Everything he says is in English.
5354313	5357955	Of course, the freak with the CD player in his head is the only one who speaks English.
5357975	5359455	Well, he's also not Japanese.
5359956	5362557	Did he also ask if you could pay for his credit card?
5364578	5365318	So he speaks English.
5365839	5370061	He wasn't Japanese, but I bet all the machinery in his head was.
5371414	5373155	I'm totally ignoring all this chaos.
5373175	5373996	I'm listening to Yanni.
5393743	5397546	He's, uh, he's like, oh, I'm like, you know, I saw something else on TV, by the way.
5397766	5398327	This is cool.
5398527	5399327	You actually watch TV?
5399347	5399988	I watch TV.
5400028	5405352	I was at Julie's house yesterday, and we were, we just happened to watch, um, what were we watching?
5406052	5408234	We watched the Teen Titans on Cartoon Network.
5409015	5412537	And it was pretty funny, because, but the intro song was done by Puffy.
5413758	5414699	Like Puff Daddy?
5414859	5415159	No.
5415460	5415920	Oh.
5415940	5417721	The J-pop group, the girl Puffy.
5418122	5418702	Oh, okay.
5418722	5420864	I think she got, like, sued by him for using the name.
5422998	5423578	Fuck him!
5423818	5424198	I know!
5427039	5433340	But, um, there was like some drama about it a while back, but the opening song was done by Puffy and it was all in Japanese and it was cute.
5434280	5436620	You got a Teen Titans looks gay from the chat room.
5437520	5438521	It was funny!
5439701	5440541	It was funny!
5440621	5442041	It was very happy and gay.
5442681	5452223	No, the guy, it's like, it's done in the style of Batman Beyond, but they do like cutesy manga things, like Beast Boy was doing sweat drops and everything, it was cute.
5455428	5457049	Don't everybody talk at once!
5457349	5458769	You guys want to hear who won the cage match?
5459029	5459269	No.
5460070	5460310	Okay.
5460370	5462431	Okay, then we'll go to a break, I guess, and then we'll tell you guys.
5462451	5462891	Who's the winner?
5463751	5468713	The winner tonight, and I thought we were going to have a tie, but we got one vote in at the last minute that broke the tie.
5469334	5475757	So, tonight's winner, it was a low voting night, you guys pissed me off, that's right.
5476537	5478658	Tonight's winner, surprisingly enough, is...
5486410	5487952	Jamie, you were that close.
5488012	5492876	Your song just had one vote shy, and Loki, you only got one vote.
5492976	5494498	So, people are sick of that song, finally.
5494518	5498782	They got tired of still my words, so it's a more ghost-type planet mix.
5499703	5501144	And an honorable mention to Holic.
5503466	5505807	Do you mean that Pixie Dust Underwear didn't get any votes?
5505827	5507227	Pixie Dust Underwear did not get any votes.
5507567	5509127	Oh my god, that's a sin.
5509968	5511288	I vote for you.
5513228	5516469	I didn't have any voting privileges, so I couldn't vote for the underwear.
5516489	5525571	I think we collectively, as a non-voting group, because we're all here and only people in the chatroom can vote, we'll all collectively vote for Pixie Dust Underdrawers.
5528524	5529585	All of us except you.
5530826	5541994	Oh, which one is it?
5542174	5542675	Let's go to break.
5543715	5549720	Sounds like a good idea.
5550600	5550981	Alright.
5553242	5554183	The fan is on.
5554203	5554964	This is great.
5555504	5557786	Now I feel like I'm in Hurricane Force winds.
5558973	5559554	We'll be back.
5560134	5563077	And after this break, I actually have some DDR music.
5563857	5565419	Not DDR music, DDR news.
5565859	5567941	Because we have home versions coming out very soon.
5567981	5568782	We've got to talk about this.
5568802	5570443	A lot of news on the home versions this week.
5571344	5574847	And a lot of making fun of them that we have to do when we come back.
5575627	5576929	Hooray for making fun of stuff.
5577009	5577669	It's what we do best.
5577689	5578650	Because that's what we do.
5580251	5581753	Jamie, what's the song you want to hear this break?
5582256	5583177	What song do I want to hear?
5583357	5584078	Yeah.
5584979	5586440	I want to hear all the songs that everybody hates.
5586520	5588342	I want to hear Cartoon Heroes, so we're putting that in.
5588362	5589263	Put Cartoon Heroes in.
5589303	5591345	Put Love That Feelin' in.
5592206	5592646	Oh, God.
5592666	5594108	I don't even know if I can find Love That Feelin'.
5594668	5594849	Is it?
5594869	5594969	Okay.
5594989	5597912	No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
5597932	5598192	Go back.
5598312	5599213	No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
5599954	5604979	I want Volume 4 in.
5605800	5605980	What?
5607426	5607687	Volume 4.
5608129	5608731	Okay, that's enough.
5608751	5609072	That's three.
5609312	5609573	Okay.
5609975	5612142	Alright, we'll be right back after this break.
5612443	5613005	Stay tuned.
5613025	5614088	You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
5614128	5614409	Thank you.
5780820	5781321	DarkSakura
5808468	5826961	I can't write down, can't write down a ship Round and round, move like a finger, come down Jack, Steve Burnett, get to the fever I'm kicking the floor, can't get right down the jerk In the box with my ticket to the floor, come down Jack, Steve Burnett, never forget, I'm a friend to the best Moving the juice
5851039	5851900	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5897452	5898316	Thanks for watching!
5992031	5998595	Niko Meow, Niko Meow, Niko Meow, Meow, Meow Oh, Ash!
5999136	6001797	This randomness could only be brought to you by Orange Lounge.
6005340	6007941	We're back, and we're here.
6008882	6012344	And Rob's running around, on fire, because he's so hot.
6013045	6015566	And we're being attacked by a giant metallic man.
6017408	6017608	Ah!
6018388	6018989	Yeah.
6019849	6020330	You know what?
6021423	6026765	I'm thinking that because the chat room has demanded it, we should bring back one of our favorite segments.
6027945	6029006	Match Game!
6029326	6031847	But not immediately because someone has to write up the things for Match Game.
6032547	6034848	So, we need to do the FUs of the week.
6034888	6036248	That is a very important thing.
6036929	6045972	So, well, you know, why don't you conduct the interview so I can...
6048658	6049138	Interview?
6050038	6051159	Am I supposed to be interviewing?
6051499	6053540	Rob's going to... Let Rob do it.
6053860	6055700	Rob's going to come... Hurry up, Rob.
6057261	6058861	Let him count the money and you come over here.
6059201	6059481	Okay.
6060242	6060802	Take that mic.
6061722	6062082	Wait, what?
6062122	6064983	Do you need me to write Match Game or do you want to do it?
6065003	6066544	Okay, James is going to do Match Game.
6066744	6067564	Where's this cord going?
6067724	6069345	It's going under Loki's chair.
6071845	6073206	Stop moving your chair around.
6073246	6074726	It's rolling over the cable.
6076327	6076707	You know what?
6079810	6081511	I'm going to walk circles around Loki while I do this.
6081571	6081771	Okay.
6083652	6086174	Anyway, so Puppy had a summer job.
6086494	6086594	Yes.
6086614	6087695	And where was this summer job at?
6088015	6091057	At Castro Valley Golf Land, just like last summer.
6091577	6091877	Uh-huh.
6092438	6097821	And so I understand that last month you had a very interesting experience while you were working there at the night shift.
6099182	6102704	A little thing called Armed Takeover Robbery.
6104841	6110525	I know, see, you know what, and what I think is so great about this is that Puppy has such a great sense of humor about getting robbed at gunpoint.
6112447	6113888	I know, it's kind of funny.
6114929	6116210	So what happened, what happened?
6117511	6126858	It was like, it was Sunday night, we closed at 11, but there was this last group of people out on the golf courses that was taking fucking forever, because they were trying to like...
6127799	6145708	Jump on each other and beat each other up while they're golfing So they left about 11.30 And then we closed up the arcade The other employee that was there left So it was just me and the assistant manager there I went out to clean the bathrooms about 11.40 And then apparently some black truck came
6146536	6148837	came creeping into the parking lot.
6148857	6150778	Three guys jumped out all with guns.
6151179	6151939	They come running up.
6152039	6158103	I'm in the bathroom sitting there scrubbing the sink with a brush and all of a sudden I see two guys coming behind me.
6158143	6160064	I'm like, you shut the fuck up right now.
6160084	6161765	They're like, okay, whatever.
6162405	6163826	And they both have their guns.
6163846	6166387	They're just kind of nonchalant.
6166408	6168088	Were you high off the cleaning fumes?
6168189	6168869	Is that what it is?
6170810	6172891	No, it's not that kind of cleaning fumes.
6173171	6174712	It's not those kind of cleaning fluids.
6174732	6175693	I wish it was, though.
6177513	6184716	They basically were just like, yeah, we don't want to hurt nobody, where's the fucking money at, how do we get in, who else is in there, typical shit.
6186257	6195480	And it was funny because the whole time I was just like, not even, I was pretty much ignoring the fact that they had guns.
6196661	6202623	Because all three of them, they had, well, after the first two guys came in... Were they real guns?
6203223	6205925	They probably were real guns, but chances are they weren't even loaded.
6205945	6206765	Yeah.
6208223	6213386	And it was kind of funny because I was sitting there standing there while the two guys with the guns were asking me questions.
6213406	6215507	I saw the third guy come up around the corner of the building.
6215947	6219829	And he comes running around like he's a fucking 007 or something.
6219849	6220669	Like he was a QZAR.
6221350	6222430	Yeah.
6224631	6228313	He comes running around the corner looking around like he's trying to see if there's anybody around.
6228993	6232655	Like he's going to run in and tackle somebody.
6235646	6236186	So what happened?
6236206	6237127	They rounded you all up.
6238027	6249553	They got me and the assistant manager, they took me around the back, through the workroom in the back, into the manager's office where the assistant manager's in there counting money.
6250793	6252854	Actually, he just finished counting up all the money for the night.
6254235	6259458	And we were about to make, he had a bag of money that was sealed up to drop off at the bank.
6260600	6269081	so they had us both on the floor they duct taped our hands behind our backs and then dug through and made a fucking mess out of everything
6270273	6278516	and then they took the money and they took a bucket of change that the assistant manager usually keeps with them to take to buy options.
6278536	6279316	Well, draw plan tokens.
6279676	6280176	Actually, no.
6280616	6283397	Surprisingly, they didn't take tokens, which was kind of funny.
6283857	6285658	What would you do if you stole tokens?
6285698	6286618	That's so sad.
6286638	6289319	I know.
6289359	6291000	It'd be kind of funny to see them all take tokens.
6291060	6295201	Are you that hard up for DDR that you have to steal tokens at gunpoint?
6295381	6296541	Well, they were black.
6296561	6297502	I don't think they played DDR.
6298682	6303787	I know some... There were black teenagers with guns.
6303807	6305128	What the hell do you think?
6305168	6307110	Well, he didn't have a gun and he wasn't a teenager.
6309732	6310172	Anyway.
6312474	6313796	We don't know what you would do with it, lovey.
6313836	6316738	If I was a black teenager with a gun, I'd be playing DDR whenever I want.
6318649	6320290	It wouldn't be no fucking lie.
6320870	6321831	Not with a gun, anyway.
6322711	6326554	Okay, so they took his bucket of change, and he had sets of keys in there.
6326574	6335579	They threw out two of his three sets of keys, which one of the keys was actually the set of keys to all the doors and all the games and stuff inside the arcade.
6335839	6336640	They didn't take those.
6337140	6339641	They said, I accidentally took his car keys.
6341342	6344024	Now he can't get into his car, and he has to walk home.
6346365	6352168	This is like, by the time this whole ordeal was done with the cops getting there and everything, it was like almost 2 in the morning.
6353309	6356790	They had to go to Krispy Kreme and get them.
6358731	6359592	How much money did it take?
6359612	6360432	They made off with about $4,700.
6363700	6364661	I don't seem like that much.
6364701	6365782	That's all the golf I make?
6365862	6369945	Shit.
6370065	6371406	It's Castro Valley.
6371646	6372167	I'm just kidding.
6372447	6373528	It's Castro Valley, okay?
6373968	6377891	We're not fucking Milpitas or Roseville or whatever.
6377911	6378952	Oh my god.
6379352	6379933	Roseville?
6379993	6381974	Can you imagine how much money that place was making today?
6382295	6384516	But they have a security guard.
6384536	6385937	Not that we would advocate robbing.
6387078	6387679	Just saying.
6387839	6389020	Maybe vandalism.
6390061	6390361	Maybe.
6391602	6394064	No, we do not advocate any of those things.
6394344	6396025	We're a good, polite show.
6397246	6399868	But if you want to trip some little kids while you're there, feel free.
6402590	6405653	Just don't damage the property, because we don't advocate that, because we don't want to get sued.
6406133	6409936	Trip little kids all you want, though.
6409996	6411177	I hate little kids.
6411197	6413199	Then tell the kids to have their parents sue Golfland.
6416814	6419680	The funny part was, as they left, they called the cops.
6421348	6426073	Well, because they were nice robbers, and they wanted you guys to get untied at some point, but they weren't going to do it.
6426353	6430977	I mean, that would not be smart for the robbers to untie you, because they'd have to, like, untie you and run really, really fast.
6431337	6434921	But they'd have to, like, untie you and then punch you in the face so you could slow down a little bit.
6435381	6436642	But I don't think they wanted to do that.
6436683	6438564	I think they just wanted to have somebody else come do it.
6439305	6443749	Well, yeah, but you wouldn't have liked that if they'd untied you and then, like, punch you in the face, would you?
6444090	6445291	If they... I would have...
6448444	6457430	Well, if they were going to actually try, if they would have undone that, and there was just one of them in the room, I would have probably kicked the bloody crap out of him.
6458150	6462072	Because, I mean, I could defend myself against one person, but not three, and if once.
6463153	6467696	And then it would have been nice if also the gun that he had would have been loaded, that I could, you know, just use that.
6467876	6468396	Okay.
6468436	6471318	And then that's the whole dream sequence thing.
6472619	6477302	Enter dream sequence, and I kill the other two guys, and I'm the hero, and yeah.
6481914	6485636	Loki called him a loser I intentionally took the next day off
6503913	6506134	Did you call in emotionally scarred to work?
6507314	6514558	No, actually it was more like I needed to go out of the DMV because the fuckers took our driver's license.
6514678	6519700	They took out both of our wallets, go through them, and take out just the driver's license.
6519821	6523262	No cash, no credit cards, no anything else.
6523342	6524783	Just our driver's licenses.
6526277	6532181	I mean, because I would have done them a lot of good, you know, to have your driver's license because, you know, you look just like a black teenager and all.
6532641	6533682	Yeah, I know.
6536824	6537685	I don't know about that.
6540207	6540547	Anyway.
6540927	6549994	They could have sold it to an illegal immigrant, but any other... Well, I ended up spending like three hours at the DMV the next day to get my new driver's license.
6550274	6552475	And out of all that, I got a new picture on my driver's license.
6552615	6553176	I hate old boys.
6555010	6560756	and now my picture looks much better and more like me instead of me at 10 a.m.
6562657	6563398	Yay!
6564379	6567302	Okay, so anything else you want to add to your robbing a gunpoint story?
6569504	6569664	No?
6570085	6570365	Okay.
6571226	6572687	Loki, why don't you give us a sim update?
6573588	6574249	Sims!
6575410	6576131	The Sims!
6577079	6578400	Here's my update.
6578600	6579661	There is no update.
6579721	6580961	Nothing is going on.
6581161	6582842	Absolutely, positively nothing.
6583103	6585464	Except for the fact that you just downloaded a complete mix, too.
6585924	6589046	That's an emulator, not a simulator.
6589086	6590487	Oh, okay, technicality, my bad.
6590507	6594890	Yeah, and you know what pisses me off about this emulator?
6595870	6596691	Is that, um...
6599432	6612203	No, um, no, here's what the thing is, it's like, okay, I've got the hard drive image for the Japanese version of Complete Mix 2, yet I have the ROM for the US version of Complete Mix 2, and they don't work together.
6612624	6613505	Ooh, that's not good.
6613625	6618749	No, they do for, um, it's weird because they do for Complete Mix 1, but I don't know why it's not working for Complete Mix 1.
6618789	6620591	I thought Complete Mix 1 was Hitmania.
6621431	6622011	It's the same thing.
6622272	6622912	Hip-hop mania.
6623252	6627115	Well, yeah, but maybe hip-hop mania and... Hip-hop mania is the same thing.
6627135	6630117	It's just a different ROM, same hard drive image.
6631598	6631778	Ooh.
6631798	6634400	Ooh.
6634700	6637102	Um, okay, so we got a lot of ground we want to cover here.
6637122	6638663	I've got some DDR news I want to talk about.
6638683	6639543	We want to do match game.
6639563	6640564	We want to do the FUs of the week.
6640604	6642285	So what do you guys want to do first?
6642365	6642685	Jamie?
6643766	6644366	Do you have preference?
6646308	6647549	Jamie wants to do FUs next.
6647909	6649170	So let's, um...
6650771	6652531	We're going to go to a break and then come back and do the FUs.
6652751	6655232	Let's do... Okay, let's do the FUs now.
6655912	6657373	Chatroom can submit them while we're doing ours.
6657393	6662154	Oh wait, no, she's going to put the music up herself.
6663454	6664614	No, it's just going to take a second here.
6667915	6672056	So if you want to submit an FU of the week, Chatroom, just send those over a private message to me right now.
6672096	6673917	You can send those in while we're doing ours.
6675948	6684471	Usually I give you guys a break, but people don't start sending them in anyway until they hear us doing ours, so I don't think it does a lot of good anyway, so... So forget it!
6686591	6689292	So, Jamie, what happens during the FUs of the Week?
6689712	6690793	And so we bitch about stuff.
6691453	6692213	Well, here we go.
6703657	6704517	Here is my foot.
6708738	6715603	Um, my first FU of the week goes toward mixed auto sales in Roseville, and they're out of business now, the bitches.
6716363	6717384	I bought my car from them.
6717984	6720606	My car had a low idle, but he assured me, you know, it's fine.
6720966	6721627	We can fix it.
6722588	6724069	Now my engine is dead.
6724329	6727451	Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, fuck you.
6728211	6730133	I love my car, and now it's shit.
6730853	6731654	Fuck him a whole lot.
6732574	6734135	And I can't even begin to...
6735735	6737156	Say how mad I am over this.
6737596	6739618	Because who all has been in my car with me?
6741119	6742620	Who all knows how much I love my car?
6743661	6745022	Okay, I love my car.
6745682	6746463	And now it's shit.
6747624	6749185	So, I hope he eats shit.
6750286	6752247	And then poops it.
6752928	6753708	And then has it.
6754288	6756510	Well, he's obviously bankrupt.
6756870	6761734	No, I want him to eat shit, poop it, and then have it fed intravenously to him.
6764713	6765756	Yeah, 40 seconds.
6766477	6767139	Wow.
6769163	6773072	And then, and then, I want all of the shit blood drained from him.
6774326	6778049	and then given to him as a suppository.
6779310	6781132	I want him to have a bloodshot enema.
6781752	6785915	This is such a tasteful show this evening.
6785976	6786856	I'm so excited.
6786876	6787637	I am so pissed off.
6787677	6788037	No, no.
6788738	6790779	I don't even get started when I'm really pissed off.
6790819	6797365	When I am really, really, really pissed off, I think of the most foul and horrible things that will happen to people and then imagine them.
6798777	6805340	This is me at work Friday, thinking of all kinds of foul... I've had days to think of how I want this man to die.
6807101	6809943	I could come up with so many good tortures.
6810163	6812724	But the thing is, is that just killing him wouldn't be enough.
6813484	6816286	Because when you're dead, you can't talk to a dead person anymore.
6816746	6820208	Unless you, like, you can pull their soul from the bowels of hell.
6820548	6828352	But usually the bowels of hell are even worse than what, you know, what any single person alive could imagine.
6830540	6836145	Just have a defibrillator handy so that when he actually dies, like, you wait five minutes, then bring him back to life and kill him again.
6837666	6839667	And you can't do that much damage to somebody, though.
6840068	6845052	And you'd have to, like, freeze them to death and then warm them up and, you know, thaw them out like a TV dinner.
6845392	6846153	Ooh, microwave.
6846433	6850336	But, you know, you could, like, stick his hand in a microwave and then trigger it to where his hand would explode.
6850636	6851517	You'd live through that.
6851557	6853659	You'd have a little bit of radiation poisoning, but you'd live.
6854340	6856862	Um, you know, I'm mad.
6857302	6857682	I'm mad.
6858403	6859224	Um, I'm very mad.
6860379	6865161	I'm mad that my antibiotics have done nothing but make me sick all week.
6865781	6867122	But I took the last one today.
6867962	6869003	So I'm officially healthy.
6871404	6875125	But I still have to take all the other crap and my nose is still running, so I didn't do crap for that.
6879067	6881888	And then, and then, yes, I love my car.
6882148	6883189	I said I love my car.
6883309	6883849	Deal with it.
6884609	6885270	I love my car.
6886570	6887951	And then, fuck Nissan.
6889605	6892646	Because I asked them if they would order me a Skyline and they said no.
6895747	6896227	I want one.
6897287	6898848	They said no.
6898868	6900808	The dealerships will not actually import the cars.
6900848	6903769	You have to go buy them yourself and ship it yourself.
6904429	6906610	Which is fine because I know a place I can get one for $60,000.
6906750	6909811	But that's $60,000 more.
6910171	6911451	I'd go to my bank, hey, give me $60,000.
6911552	6914232	I need to order me a car.
6914632	6916333	They'd be like, uh, no.
6918351	6927679	Sure, you can have it, but here's a, you know, 20% interest rate, you know, while we steal your firstborn, your liver, and your kidneys and sell them in New Orleans on the market.
6929580	6933503	Um, well, they, yeah, it'd be great.
6933883	6936706	You know, I'll say, you can have my firstborn, and then I just won't breathe.
6937286	6938707	So I'm cool, I speak our hate.
6939508	6941770	Um, and then, um,
6943462	6944783	You know, fuck my computer.
6944823	6954509	It does this weird thing, and I don't know why, where it will not save my image files as a JPEG or a GIF as they're uploaded on their sites as.
6954929	6956049	It'll save it as a bitmap.
6956830	6957470	Untitled bitmap.
6957530	6959451	So I have to title everything.
6959471	6965535	I have tons of bitmaps on my computer now, so it's taking up more space than it needs to, but then again, I have that under 20 gig hard drive, so I'm fine.
6966556	6970318	And then... And then...
6972236	6974616	You know, there's just really not a lot else.
6975737	6976677	I can't really think of anything else.
6976957	6978957	It's really my car, my car makes me cry.
6980078	6988779	And oh yeah, a big, big F you to Phantasy Star Online for freezing when I was going into the ruins.
6988899	6992680	And then we were just like, okay, we'd gone to TGI Fridays and left our games on idle.
6993400	6999381	And I had the cord holding down my analog button on the menu so that it would keep scrolling through the menu and wouldn't log me off.
7000022	7000702	I'm smart, see?
7001742	7001962	Xbox
7003385	7007829	I have the GameCube one, too.
7009810	7009971	No.
7010131	7012132	You can't do GameCube to Xbox.
7013053	7014394	It does waste the money.
7014635	7018878	If I remember right, they have different classes.
7019018	7020960	GameCube has a class, a separate class of its own.
7021040	7022481	Xbox has a separate class of its own, doesn't it?
7022501	7023662	No, they have the same ones.
7023922	7024503	Oh.
7024523	7025263	Well, then that sucks.
7025544	7026745	The Xbox one has more outfits.
7027285	7027405	Oh.
7028146	7029007	But at any rate, I...
7032918	7034980	I came back and Julie got logged off.
7035160	7054193	I stayed on so our room was intact and then so she logs on and everything and then as we're going down to the planet my game freezes and I can't catch all my equipped items including my devil wing mags and all my Alrapies and my god battle and my cross guards and everything but I lost my flight fan.
7055374	7058115	And I lost, like, all of my crap items.
7058135	7061217	So the thing is, is that I have max money, so it was kind of cool.
7061237	7063217	But it was just aggravating having to go get all that stuff.
7064178	7067159	So... And I went up, like, five levels that night.
7067199	7067659	It was great.
7067959	7068460	Six levels.
7069040	7069740	Went up six levels.
7070320	7071861	And then we did Endless Nightmare, and that was cool.
7072941	7076483	Um... But another F you goes to Diet Pepsi for tasting like shit.
7077323	7078704	But the vanilla Pepsi's not bad.
7079024	7080245	The Diet Vanilla Pepsi's not bad.
7080785	7083086	But regular Pepsi... And also...
7084372	7089516	I drank a nine-month-old mudslide, so fuck my stomach for not being able to process it.
7089936	7096422	I've got to give an FU to Pepsi for making a vanilla Pepsi that tastes so damn good, because I hate Pepsi.
7096442	7098343	Vanilla Pepsi is the best.
7099304	7100745	What did I say when vanilla Coke came out?
7100785	7102246	I said, can't wait for vanilla Pepsi.
7102306	7102667	Here it is.
7102707	7105409	Vanilla Coke has that same Coke-y aftertaste.
7107530	7111634	And another FU goes toward my lifestyle adjustment.
7113154	7118558	because on the outside it looks successful, but not when I stepped on the scale, so.
7119779	7121059	I'm using my gym membership now.
7121380	7123221	And fuck everybody who won't go to the gym with me.
7123281	7123701	I hate you.
7127164	7127824	Okay, I don't hate you.
7127864	7128304	I was kidding.
7128745	7129005	I know.
7129245	7130506	But I hate the guy who sold me my car.
7130926	7131547	I know why I'm dead.
7132947	7133288	I'm aware.
7133308	7134088	No, I don't want him dead.
7134128	7134909	I want him dead.
7135569	7136510	I need a basement.
7136590	7137751	Oh my God, I need a basement.
7138826	7142988	If I had a basement, I could so set up the perfect torture chamber there.
7143008	7144448	I could see Jamie there right now.
7144788	7147149	It puts the lotion on its skin and puts it in the basket.
7147669	7153432	And, oh yeah, fuck CD Japan for making the pre-order for Battle Royale 2 80 bucks.
7162918	7163378	What?
7164178	7166299	You should see how much it is on YesAsia.com.
7166319	7166779	Fuck that shit.
7166799	7166999	Piracy!
7167599	7171940	I'm just going to see if Anime Jungle Osaka can order it for me.
7171960	7174160	Because I'll at least get it for $60 there.
7176121	7178321	Because Jamie actually collects the real thing.
7178401	7185282	I buy the real thing so I can watch it on my big TV with my DVD player over and over and over again.
7185683	7190964	And then I can copy the DVDs for my friends and get a nice transfer.
7191084	7191684	What an angel.
7191844	7192644	Okay, next.
7193823	7194623	Loki, your turn.
7199104	7200145	Mario Golf?
7201065	7202685	Mario Golf is cool!
7203385	7203905	Shut up, loser.
7204225	7210227	Anyways, first I'm going to start off with a big FP2 speedy oil change because you suck.
7210267	7214348	And the fact that you made me wait four hours to get my, you know, tune-up the first time.
7214688	7217349	Then I come to find out you ripped me off on the tune-up.
7217669	7218949	Then you break my car.
7220154	7224356	I think you wanted us to put a lawnmower engine in there.
7251252	7254795	Why do I hear Ultimate Cheeseburger?
7260420	7262102	Don't you listen to this show occasionally?
7264504	7266165	Not when I have to work Sunday nights.
7268548	7271971	Yeah, but there's always Rewind on Thursday evening.
7272992	7275474	Which I am also usually working on or sleeping.
7276306	7277046	Oh, sleeping.
7277507	7277947	I'm sorry.
7278307	7279128	That's no excuse.
7280609	7283190	That's unacceptable.
7283870	7286632	F you to stupid people who can't drive.
7287472	7290774	And normally those people that turn out in front of me and then go slow.
7292175	7293216	Oh, and another thing.
7293536	7297598	If you're driving a racer, you should not be going slower than I am.
7298519	7298879	Okay?
7299399	7302041	You're in a souped up car, supposedly.
7303803	7312568	Remember, the typical rice car, rice mobile now has like, you know, a stupid four banger in it and a hole in the muffler to sound hot.
7313609	7314369	And then just like this.
7314389	7317651	Yeah, but they had already just did all the like body modifications to it.
7317911	7321453	Hasn't quite painted it yet, but they've done all the body modifications for it.
7322114	7324655	And they were going really slow in the slow lane.
7324915	7328537	And I was trying to pass them because I was trying to, you know, go home.
7328797	7330318	Have you ever tried doing that to somebody?
7330518	7331119	It's a blast.
7331139	7331219	Yeah.
7333804	7334244	I hate that.
7335424	7342286	But anyways, F you to Radio Shack for having the parts I need but overcharging on everything.
7342826	7348427	It's like I'm buying stuff with Canadian dollars or something like that.
7349687	7352107	It costs like 4,000 times the amount.
7354928	7355208	What?
7359389	7360269	Stretch arms, Sean.
7365043	7368265	I bought S-Video cables to hook up the TV today.
7368965	7371886	First off, they don't sell anything larger than 12 feet for S-Video.
7371946	7380469	Sure, they have 100 foot regular AV cables, but no, we don't have S-Video cables that are longer than 12 feet.
7380509	7386712	So I had to buy two S-Video cables and a connector for the two of them.
7388613	7389233	That cost $45.
7389373	7390414	Holy crap!
7390874	7397817	Because it was $20 for each table and then the little piece of crap that I kid you not is about an inch.
7398418	7398898	Inch big.
7399298	7400378	Couldn't cost that much to make.
7400418	7400639	Cost $6.
7404060	7404540	I hate them.
7406641	7413244	So... Well, yeah, but it's far away in Atlanta.
7413264	7413905	Yeah.
7415045	7416646	That's what you get for living in Fulton.
7419654	7422598	I'm going to have a meme cabinet soon, so if that doesn't bother me.
7422618	7423038	My turn.
7429870	7436754	F you to people that aren't willing to drive 10 miles over the speed limit on windy roads because that's what they're built for, is going fast.
7436994	7437415	Word.
7438695	7444359	And F you as well to the fact that it's easy to climb up a rock.
7444779	7445980	You handed the mic to me, buddy.
7447461	7453344	F you to the fact that it's easy to climb up... I'll go back to you and wind them then.
7454825	7459148	F you to the fact that it's easy to climb up a rock, but it's not easy to get down.
7460984	7462225	Jumping is not an option.
7462385	7466107	Well, you know, wasting all that time and energy humping the rock, you know.
7466387	7467648	I did not hump a rock.
7468789	7473392	F you to that lady who made us stand guard while she took a pee behind the rock.
7474958	7478101	You should have taken a picture.
7478401	7479122	I almost did.
7479182	7480643	I had to go have a picture of her somewhere.
7481023	7484406	And then when you see what this woman looks like, you'll understand why I did not want to get a picture of her peeing.
7484426	7487068	She's like, she's peeing behind the rock.
7487388	7489190	Oh my God, look at that pee.
7489270	7494754	See, there was the evil side of me that wanted to go stand next to the rock and go, Oh my God, woman peeing.
7497176	7500039	And watch all the little kids run over.
7500059	7501540	Watch all the little kids run over.
7505427	7523056	I'm an F you also to the Vacaville Arcade that stars because that DDR machine got misses when I should not be getting misses and I could have had the number one score on that machine easy and your machine sucks my butt and what the hell, you have all your pink arrows on one side and all the blues on the other side.
7523096	7523896	And on the wrong side too.
7523916	7524317	That's gay.
7524597	7525397	That's really gay.
7526658	7527038	I'm done.
7527518	7528739	Back to Loki because I'm rude.
7529915	7529975	F.E.
7530195	7535119	to Scandia for putting a shooting gallery inside your arcade.
7536220	7537341	What were you thinking?
7537841	7540323	Why is there a shooting gallery in an arcade?
7541244	7547009	With like a freaking, you're playing 2DX or DDR, and I might add the DDR is broken.
7548950	7549431	All of them.
7551232	7555894	Yeah, but all the arrows suck on DDR now, so I can't play doubles or anything.
7556254	7562198	But, like, the shooting gallery, so you're playing 2DX, and it's all... What's that noise?
7562378	7568261	Oh, that was someone shooting... That's the shooting range.
7568521	7570542	Like, I'm playing Sync, right?
7570603	7576386	I have a 200-something combo going, and then all of a sudden... And, bam, combo broken.
7584146	7585888	I wish the timing was just that good.
7586508	7592194	F you to the people at Paramount that thought it was a good idea to do yet another movie about Tupac.
7593294	7595175	Yes, they're making another Tupac movie.
7595355	7596555	Tupac Resurrection.
7600456	7600917	I'm sorry.
7601177	7601757	That's cool.
7602057	7602637	That's cool.
7603738	7608859	Dude, Tupac has more sequels than Batman.
7608879	7610320	We're all going to go opening day.
7613061	7615341	Tupac Resurrection opening day.
7616502	7619083	Seriously.
7619483	7620463	It's going to be fulsome.
7620523	7620923	Come on.
7622464	7622704	Anyway.
7624533	7641777	So, yeah, that sucks, and, um, I'm trying to think what, oh, yeah, um, F you to, um, pretty much, oh, F you to the fat bitch, oh, the stupid kid that was actually asking, begging for money while playing DDR and then kept getting louder and louder because I was ignoring him.
7642757	7643078	What?
7644238	7645598	Do you have any tokens I can have?
7645838	7646138	No.
7646378	7647839	Do you have any tokens I can have?
7648079	7648399	No.
7648879	7650279	Why is this wrapped around my chair?
7650539	7651019	Again.
7652420	7652960	Stop it.
7659477	7660477	I'm not moving anywhere.
7661558	7668123	But anyways... Oh, F you to the fact that 27 inch TVs can't fit in my car very easily.
7668903	7672766	That wasn't fun in the hot sun trying to cram a TV into the side of my car.
7676509	7677549	Yes, it was funny though.
7678430	7679671	What the hell?
7682401	7682641	What?
7683061	7684262	I haven't moved at all.
7684522	7688364	Okay, I've been sitting there, people have been like, okay, let's wrap it around me.
7697208	7705932	Okay, so... I am Satan, Satan, you will die.
7705952	7710454	Okay, your chair has been liberated from the microphone cord.
7710899	7712160	F you to John Ritter dying.
7712300	7714842	Doesn't he know that he has entertainment he has to do?
7715102	7716863	Why does he have to go have heart problems now?
7717103	7719024	It's because he wasn't eating enough bacon.
7719344	7721946	He has to condition his heart for bad food.
7723807	7724527	I blame him.
7725368	7727209	Actually, I blame Suzanne Somers.
7727429	7728690	It was all her fault.
7729190	7731592	Suzanne Somers is the death of him.
7731892	7733153	John Ritter sucked anyway.
7734683	7736325	I grew up with Reach Company, hello.
7736845	7738426	But it was Suzanne Somers.
7739427	7743030	When I read that he died, the only thing that I could think of was this movie that I saw.
7743070	7751197	If you have to be stuck on an island fighting off Indians with either Suzanne Somers or John Ritter, you will want John Ritter on your side.
7753159	7754740	Suzanne Somers would be scarier.
7757088	7757588	Am I right?
7758069	7759370	Yeah, but that's the whole point.
7759470	7763052	All you need to do is start crying and talking about the starving children in China.
7763092	7767355	Oh, and another thing, the FU segment left like 10 minutes ago.
7767515	7768696	I got one more.
7769396	7774140	FU to J-Lo and Ben Affleck, because guess what?
7774260	7778783	Your marriage lasted as long as Gigli did in the box office.
7779743	7780284	Bam!
7780904	7781525	You suck.
7782465	7783166	They broke up.
7784295	7785436	Because he had second thoughts.
7785476	7787177	He's like, dude, I don't know if I can marry her.
7787737	7788737	He's such a pansy.
7791739	7793280	Her ass comes alive at night.
7793380	7794660	I can't handle it.
7796181	7801104	I'm looking at a bunch of straight men talking about the wedding of Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez.
7801204	7802865	I can't believe they're not going to get married.
7804526	7804926	Gay.
7805666	7806767	Thank you for picking that.
7807187	7810769	This is the other ironic thing is that I could give less than a shit about them.
7811775	7812836	I don't fucking care.
7812956	7814476	I don't care what the bitch is wearing.
7814816	7816097	I don't care where they're getting married.
7816137	7817278	I don't care if they broke up.
7817498	7818558	I don't care if they mate.
7818978	7819699	I don't care.
7820319	7821419	Let's watch some guns.
7822340	7824561	It's a good thing because they're not going to breed now.
7825141	7832925	And you know what's funny is NASA's crashing a 1.5 billion dollar satellite or whatever, a probe, into their house?
7833145	7838087	No, into Jupiter because they're afraid that bacteria might infect the moon around Jupiter.
7840171	7840831	Wow!
7841252	7862004	Yes, taxpayers' dollars going down the drain because PETA or some, I'm sure it's PETA because PETA's behind all the bad shit, um, you know, they're probably like going, Well, it's that condamnator who lives his life on the moon even though we have value and he lives his life there and the bacteria wipes it out so he won't feel guilty.
7862325	7865907	Then the satellite crashing into the moon will kill everything on that moon.
7867488	7873732	I hope there's an evolving civilization on Jupiter and it crushes them all!
7874192	7876974	It would be in Jupiter because Jupiter's a big gaseous mass.
7878195	7879176	Much like Suzanne Somers.
7879236	7880436	Okay.
7882118	7882498	Again.
7882778	7883218	Bam.
7884959	7885800	You're so punny.
7886160	7887101	Oh, is it my turn?
7889728	7912386	I've got a couple of FUs, a couple of political FUs actually FU to what's-her-name, that one chick who's not getting any votes For not getting any votes, I wish she would The one who's got like 5% and who needs more
7913550	7914970	Yes, Ariana Huffington.
7915010	7917651	I forgot her name.
7918731	7919652	She needs more votes.
7919752	7923013	Ariana Huffington is the greatest candidate in the election, and you should vote for her because I am.
7923033	7929234	I don't care if she's only getting a little bit of the vote, but she's great, and she supports everything I believe in, and you suck.
7930034	7933715	I'm saying she needs more votes, man.
7935296	7938937	She needs more votes for not getting enough votes.
7941207	7944129	And also... Because she's not selling her body like the other candidates.
7945390	7946851	Well, she's not getting any votes either.
7946891	7949013	She's just getting a bunch of phone calls.
7949653	7954257	Anyway, also a F you to Tom McClintock for being an ass.
7954977	7965345	And on a side note, I'd like to say F you to Nomo Ono and Silent Prophet for twisting my fragile little mind.
7966686	7969908	And all I have left to say is mazel tov.
7971997	7972978	My turn, Durand.
7973738	7978381	Um... Okay, uh... How come there's no music?
7979742	7980322	I can't hear it.
7980722	7982583	Well, then you should turn up your hearing aid.
7984665	7985645	What, Sonny?
7985665	7989167	Okay, um... Okay.
7990008	7993650	For one... Fuck traffic.
7994090	7997993	Because I hate traffic, and it's a pain in the ass, especially on every freeway.
7998393	7999934	And all the people who were on the road today.
8000430	8010314	Yes That dumb bitch that wouldn't get out of my fucking lane That woman, oh my god That woman was stupid And did you see the big jet in the back of her van?
8010454	8026299	Yeah, it was probably from somebody that she cut off like that She deserved it, bitch She looked like, like Sloth from the Goonies I didn't get to see her, but I got to see you flip her off Then, uh
8030250	8034373	Fuck Disneyland for ruining Big Thunder Mountain Railroad by having somebody die on it.
8035773	8038835	Because I love that ride, and now it's a death trap.
8042518	8043038	I love that ride.
8043058	8046380	I'm waiting for a bunch of people to die on, you know, Mr. Toad's Wild Ride.
8048081	8052424	They're gonna get thrown out of a car and land on the ground and get run over by a car on a track.
8052504	8054225	One of the animatronics runs over them.
8055293	8060056	I bet he has someone to fall off of the balcony in the ghost house in the Haunted Mansion.
8060076	8061677	That'd be great.
8064539	8068202	Then that supposed rising elevator will actually collapse.
8069983	8074826	And then, uh, fuck skin allergies, because they suck.
8075727	8083352	And fuck every kind of medicine that I've been prescribed to fix it and has it worked, or made it worse, or made it worse.
8084747	8110292	because it sucks, and uh, figures that I, fuck not being able to figure out everything that I wanted to rant about when I actually get here, because I, this morning, you got it all out in the car, I might have, yes, but uh, but I always think of stuff like on the way, like before I come, even leave to come here, and now I'm like, okay, you can have the microphone when I'm done, Loki, okay, do you have a microphone now, I'm not done yet,
8111866	8113027	Okay, uh, let's see.
8114208	8118771	Fuck the DDR machine at Tapioca Express in Davis because it's shit now.
8119951	8123354	I mean, it was kinda... It was crap before, but it's shit now.
8124755	8125235	And, uh...
8127970	8128270	Yeah.
8129371	8136255	Oh, yeah, I said, uh, fuck Fousey's health drinks, because those gave me really bad diarrhea the past few days.
8139556	8142858	They taste good, but it doesn't come out the other end very well.
8143018	8145460	Thank you for that information that we didn't need to know.
8145960	8149962	No, you need to know that, because it can save you from a diarrhea trip.
8153124	8154805	Who drinks anything like that, really?
8159670	8163492	But it's fruity and it's colorful and it's healthy.
8166554	8167814	Please pass the microphone.
8168615	8168955	No!
8169475	8171457	I don't feel like passing the microphone yet.
8171477	8174018	Alright, I got one more real quick.
8174998	8176159	Quiet time, quiet time.
8178160	8181222	F you to the neighbor upstairs because she's a racist.
8183991	8188793	Yeah, I was watching my allergies and I saw the Mexicans and they were looking at your tools!
8206155	8207055	There goes analogy!
8207195	8210096	Oh, I better stay away from that one!
8211917	8214118	So, she's an evil racist.
8214238	8215158	I told you she's crazy!
8215458	8215858	I knew it!
8216098	8216759	I knew it all along!
8216779	8218179	She's an evil racist.
8218299	8221360	What's that with that sign over there, that corner that says Negro Bar?
8222481	8223961	Mexican stole my stereo.
8224321	8225822	That's really the name of the bar.
8225962	8227902	I hate to break it to you, but it really is called that.
8228142	8230763	It's because it's Spanish for Black Bar.
8231404	8231944	No way!
8233924	8235525	Anyway, Bradley...
8237759	8238340	Bradley's turn.
8239160	8242283	Alright, fuck you to running out of money because I'm almost out now.
8242984	8253174	And fuck you to the crappy economy and me for taking so long to get to the crappy economy to find maybe a crappy job I have to go just to stay out here.
8254195	8255776	Well, then talk to them about it later.
8257598	8258118	It's something good.
8259159	8262022	It doesn't require too much talking to people because I'll suck at that.
8263003	8263964	Yeah, that's good.
8267498	8271761	See, that's why I couldn't get Bradley a job at Health Net, because I... Oh, shit, I just gave away where I work.
8271801	8273181	He lives at Death Net.
8273322	8274402	He's at Death Net.
8274462	8278445	You know, because most of the people there take calls, so... I don't ever hear you talk.
8278605	8279385	Yeah.
8291741	8316078	Okay, uh, let's see, fuck you for having my hair being too long, it's getting annoying, time to cut it, but, low money, I can't really go to a barber, I've been, I've cut my hair like twice, I've cut my hair like the last two times, I wonder if anyone noticed, because it probably looked crappy, but, well, it's grown out now, so...
8318970	8323773	And fuck you to perfume inserts and cologne inserts, I hate smelling that shit all the time.
8324794	8328656	It comes in the mail, it smells up the mailbox, it smells up everything.
8329116	8330037	It fills up your mail.
8331637	8331898	Yeah.
8332198	8335320	Fuck you to people who wear too much cologne and perfume.
8337081	8339782	You stunk before you put it on, and then you stunk after.
8340302	8340803	Even worse.
8343064	8343304	Yeah.
8346426	8347266	And... I don't know.
8351209	8354012	and the general fuck-use to every other crappy thing in the world.
8366021	8367002	Jobs for everyone.
8367302	8368263	Jobs for the people.
8369624	8370304	Bring them down.
8371105	8372726	Puppy's asking where Brad and Irene are tonight.
8372786	8377229	Actually, tomorrow is Brad's birthday, and they're celebrating tonight.
8377970	8381573	Because they're actually coming over for Vanilla Sky tomorrow, believe it or not.
8382013	8383054	They went to San Francisco today.
8384935	8386176	Happy birthday, Brad!
8389098	8392861	I miss a lot of cold winter nights, a lot of birthdays in September, I notice.
8393602	8393742	Yep.
8396141	8397202	Did anyone notice that I had one?
8397322	8398262	When was your birthday?
8399563	8400323	I won't tell.
8400343	8400383	Hi.
8400403	8405866	There's an entry in my live journal that will tell you which day it was.
8406346	8407647	Because it's a clue.
8410288	8413170	There's an entry there.
8413850	8415391	Well, happy birthday whenever it is.
8416512	8418733	It was early in the month, very early.
8419653	8421694	It's when I went to the DMV, so you can figure it out from there.
8421975	8422535	I gotcha.
8422555	8424396	I had to renew my license that day.
8425942	8428343	and that was fun waiting for three hours.
8428563	8432885	At least they didn't charge me for not updating my dress for two years.
8433125	8440368	Because I feel like I'd get caught without updating your dress, like a $100 fine.
8440388	8443990	No fine, that's good.
8445811	8447572	Okay, is that everybody in the room that wanted to go?
8448392	8450013	I don't think Joey wanted to go, so anybody else?
8450333	8450573	Okay.
8451093	8452754	Let's do the chat room if he doesn't.
8452774	8453694	That is all.
8456081	8456421	All right.
8459062	8460042	Let's start with the FUs.
8460822	8466383	23rd Magus says, FU to the local Papa Murphys for not giving me an interview appointment this weekend.
8466403	8467404	They said they would.
8467864	8469124	Show me the motherfucking money.
8469484	8470724	FU to Angel's work schedule.
8470744	8471565	This is ridiculous.
8471765	8473585	FU to slow leveling in Ragnarok Online.
8473625	8475826	There's got to be a faster way to level up my acolyte, dammit.
8476886	8477926	Early free... Oh, never mind.
8477946	8479266	That was a Prime Minister review.
8479506	8481507	Jamie says she will take you to level up.
8483263	8487517	DarkTetsuya says, F you to the stupid hick driving the pickup truck full of crap on the way to my girlfriend's.
8487878	8489463	He must have been doing 20 miles an hour.
8493291	8515956	Pixie Dust says, F you to work, cutting my hours down to 26, F you to this ugly, bitchy girl that I want to smack so bad, fuck you to gaining weight, hello, I'm already big enough, fuck, fuck, fuck, being so frustrated with money, poop, shit, bloody tampon, oh yeah, fuck, F you to credit, credit is fucking frustrating, damn fucking bills, oh, and F you to rollerblading, being a good workout, it makes me hyperventilate and feel like I'm gonna die, F you to exes,

8536346	8544871	John Fields says, F you to my rear brake pads dying after only 12,000 miles F you to not having a car this week at school F you to the hurricane that's headed my way, huh?
8547106	8574011	F you to computers that don't work right from the minute you load the operating system F you to Radio Shack 2 for not having SVGA cables longer than 12 feet I want to use my HDTV 43 inch for my 15 foot away couch as my computer monitor Dolemek says F you to not having two days off in a row F you to not winning megabucks which I'm guessing is a lottery in his state
8575492	8579734	VidPowa says, F you to nothing in particular and everything in general.
8582095	8583116	Too vague!
8586957	8592540	Your buddy and mine, Nostylan says, um, my F you for not having a job and my car being dead.
8594021	8594341	Sucks.
8597162	8597903	Alright, that's it.
8598263	8599543	That's all for the F yous of the week.
8600144	8600644	Finally!
8601820	8602680	We're going to do a quick break.
8602700	8603641	We're going to set up for a match game.
8603661	8604922	Then we're going to come back and do the match game.
8605322	8607043	In the meantime, I'm going to ask a question.
8607083	8610624	And the first two people to message me the answer to this question will get to play a match game.
8611085	8613006	It's a memory retention question.
8613086	8615067	How well have you been listening to this show?
8616607	8617148	Here we go.
8620689	8621750	Not last week.
8621850	8623331	I'm going to ask a question this week.
8624251	8627373	The question is... It's an easy question.
8627433	8628873	If you guys don't get it, you're retarded.
8628893	8629734	Okay, here we go.
8631189	8635011	What golf land does puppy work at over the summer?
8635451	8636211	That's the question.
8636271	8638993	First two people to private message me the answer get to play match game.
8641554	8641914	All right.
8642654	8648717	And I realize all you are at differing buffers and it's probably not fair for me to ask a question over the radio, but you know what, kids?
8649077	8649958	Life's not fair.
8652219	8653239	So deal with it.
8654620	8658542	In the meantime, a break with a Keyboard Mania song I want to hear.
8658762	8659282	We'll be back.
8660811	8661407	with Match Game.
8767301	8785138	That's right, Joe Strick, Joyce Ward Before there were words, communication was done through teeth Body language is controlled by rhythm Music is a universal link Feel this, feel these Think of this world without sound Can't even feel a heart pound Wasting time, wasting life, wasting self Should've been your health

8880752	8881354	Thanks for watching!
8925156	8925762	Thank you.
8975201	8977083	Welcome back, boys and girls, to Orange Lounge Radio.
8977103	8978384	We're going to play the match game now.
8978644	8980065	Let me explain how match game works.
8980585	8984208	Basically, we're going to ask a question, and then there's a blank somewhere in that question.
8984228	8985089	We're not really asking a question.
8985109	8985749	We're saying a sentence.
8985769	8987851	We're telling a story, and there's a blank in there somewhere.
8988211	8989032	You need to fill it in.
8990131	8994975	The contestants will have to fill it in, and for every celebrity they match, they get a point.
8995375	9001339	So, a lot of you meanies in the chatroom, a lot of people got the answer to the trivia question correct.
9001379	9003520	Puppy worked at Castro Valley Golf Land over the summer.
9004301	9008043	And man, when I told you you were too late, you just said, You're an asshole!
9008263	9009064	No sex for you!
9009284	9010025	You suck!
9010285	9011586	I hate you and I hate your show!
9012386	9013107	Get over it!
9014147	9016289	Hey, I have something to dedicate to all these people, right?
9016309	9016489	Yes.
9018459	9018999	DJ Tyrant, Gas, A SoCal Man
9038291	9040313	Contestant number two, and this should be interesting.
9040513	9041875	This is going to be very interesting.
9042515	9043236	No styling.
9043256	9045879	This is contestant number two.
9046840	9049342	So, contestants, you're going to send your answers.
9049382	9052986	When I ask a question, you send your answers to me over private message in the chat room.
9053849	9055570	So, this should be interesting.
9056390	9059992	And Pixie Dust, 23rd Magus, Starktitsu, yeah, they all got it right.
9060072	9060672	Just a little late.
9060812	9061312	Sorry, kids.
9062633	9062913	All right.
9064153	9065594	Tyrant, this will be easy.
9065914	9068375	This will be easy for you, I'm telling you.
9068755	9069476	I'm so rude.
9070356	9070836	I'm so rude.
9071236	9073137	Yeah, maybe we ought to give Nostelon a handicap.
9073197	9073537	I don't know.
9073557	9076218	No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
9076258	9077159	All right, no, we're not going to do that.
9077179	9077519	Here we go.
9079040	9080700	And Marin was close.
9080740	9081881	She said, not Roseville.
9083735	9086356	But she was still the third person anyway.
9086436	9089457	She would have had it right if she said CBGL.
9090818	9091578	Well, you know what?
9091618	9095419	But she gets to listen and know that she inspired this wonderful segment tonight.
9096200	9098501	Maybe we should have an honorable third party.
9100081	9101162	Maybe we're running out of time.
9101222	9104363	Here we go.
9105743	9106724	As much as I love Marin.
9108304	9108965	Alright, here we go.
9109065	9109965	Question number one.
9112208	9118773	One day, Betty the Bomani Addict... Joey, those are the music games.
9120113	9121434	Everybody, by the way, is playing tonight.
9121474	9122675	Everybody is a celebrity here tonight.
9123636	9127058	Betty the Bomani Addict decided she was tired of playing Beatmania.
9127738	9130320	Instead, she decided to try the new Bomani game.
9130760	9131141	Blank!
9132181	9135824	Jamie wrote all of tonight's questions, by the way, so if you don't like a question, blame her.
9138257	9141998	Betty, the Bomani addict, decided she was tired of playing Beatmania.
9142098	9146240	Instead, she decided to try the new Bomani game, Blank.
9158563	9160504	The contestants are thinking.
9161824	9163645	I have one contestant locked in with their answer.
9166600	9167920	And I think that's both contestants.
9167980	9171021	Let me just verify they did submit answers and not questions like, huh?
9172021	9172741	Yeah, there's one.
9172941	9173421	I got a huh.
9173441	9174001	Give me a sec.
9177402	9178382	I need another pen.
9182443	9182743	Okay.
9185104	9186304	Okay, I have both answers.
9189704	9190725	Are all the celebrities ready?
9191565	9192065	Okay, here we go.
9193223	9196404	Alright, let's see what you guys put.
9196424	9198805	You want to do the contestants first?
9198905	9199886	Let's do the contestants first.
9199906	9200546	This is the way the show did it.
9201246	9201486	What?
9203227	9206368	What do you mean, just in case?
9211470	9211951	I don't care.
9212371	9212691	I don't care.
9213131	9220294	Tyron says... Instead, she decided to try the new Bomani game, Marshall Beat.
9221991	9225293	That's not a new Bomani game, but that's what he said, so there it is.
9226553	9228094	Maybe it's new at the arcade, I don't know.
9230055	9237819	Nostylan says, Nostylan says, Betty decided to try the new Bomani game, DDR beat their meat.
9242342	9244963	Okay, let's see.
9247284	9250226	Loki, your answer was, he decided to try the new Bomani game.
9251297	9252417	Marshall Beat Off.
9254158	9255158	Oh, so close.
9255178	9258059	Do you think that's a... Can I give them both a point?
9258079	9258619	You know what?
9258639	9261300	Because Tyrant put Marshall Beat in all caps.
9262780	9265181	Beat is in caps, so the emphasis was on the beat.
9265201	9265781	Okay.
9265801	9266941	Do you want to give them both a point?
9267081	9267721	Give them both a point.
9268261	9270402	Okay, so they both get a point for that because they're both kind of close.
9270462	9270682	Okay.
9271402	9273363	A point for Tyrant and a point for No Sound.
9273663	9274663	This is amazing.
9275023	9277003	Most number of points scored in the game ever.
9277604	9278744	We had a two-point game once.
9279335	9283136	My answer was they decided to play Sarsvania.
9284777	9285797	Not a match, sorry.
9286677	9298941	Now Joey, this should be fun because Joey got to see DDR, well Joey actually got introduced to the whole DDR obsession of ours this weekend, so he's still kind of catching up on all the inside jokes, so this should be great.
9301041	9303702	Yeah, well the answer that I picked was Beat Me Down.
9305609	9307190	Beat Me Down Puppy Spoon Freaks
9330280	9332121	I said, forehead smacking mania.
9332541	9334042	Forehead smacking mania.
9334202	9334982	Fun, but no.
9336003	9336483	Punk Knight.
9337063	9338184	I'd kick a baby mania.
9338284	9339825	Kick a baby mania.
9340805	9341505	Wonderful.
9341625	9342906	However, not a match.
9343967	9346107	So, after the first round, it's all tied up one to one.
9346168	9347068	Five questions to go.
9347948	9348469	You guys ready?
9348609	9349429	Here's question number two.
9353031	9355732	Sally the Shopaholic was so excited...
9356977	9360519	The Outlet Mall had a new store that sold nothing but blank.
9362980	9365021	Sally the Shopaholic was so excited.
9366082	9368783	The Outlet Mall had a new store that sold nothing but blank.
9384039	9387903	I'm just waiting on the chat room, or waiting on our contestants to answer this question.

9436345	9437306	Flick-a-nick Dickie.
9443569	9444529	Flick-a-nick Dickie.
9444950	9449092	Tyrant says, had a new store that sold nothing but F-Zero GX.
9449812	9450192	Okay.
9450553	9453054	This wasn't Rob, it was Sally, but close, okay.
9453554	9454855	We'll see though, we'll see, you never know.
9455235	9457977	Flick-a-nick Dickie, I don't know, I was thinking about that one.
9458557	9460218	Somehow I don't think it's going to match.
9461478	9464080	I don't know if it's going to match, but I said Cuban immigrants.
9467583	9469765	A store that sold nothing but Cuban immigrants.

9482353	9482874	Panties?
9484295	9484755	Panties?
9486356	9493401	Panties, although I think flick-a-nick-dicky might be a term for panties, I'm not sure and I can't look it up, so you lose.
9493421	9493721	No points.
9494062	9494402	No points.
9497168	9498069	All right, going on.
9498469	9498730	Puppy.

9500271	9500772	Propel.
9501292	9502734	Propel, there you go.
9503054	9505877	You know, I usually expect people to pick Propel when I'm playing.
9505917	9506517	Yeah, well.
9506878	9508379	And no stupid.
9508479	9509921	We have new contestants tonight.

9522562	9524483	My answer is Detached Eyeballs.
9524903	9526944	My answer was Down Syndrome Porn.
9527004	9529886	Wow, I'm so glad we let him go last.
9546431	9547391	Miyako was so depressed.
9547411	9552653	She had been drugged and pulled into an island with her classmates to do Battle Royale.
9552673	9556073	And the weapon she was given was a blank.
9572526	9579450	Alright, she'd been drugged and pulled to the island with her classmates to do Battle Royale and the weapon she was given was a blank.
9594600	9598022	We're just waiting for the contestants to answer and waiting for all the celebrities to lock in their vote.
9598857	9604822	Miyako was so depressed, she got drugged, pulled to the island with her classmates to Battle Royale, and the weapon she was given was a blank.

9630413	9633375	Vidpala says a cassette tape of old Orange Lounge episodes.
9633415	9634496	That's lovely, thank you.
9634977	9636318	It's kind of close to what I put, though.
9639560	9640441	Okay, here we go.
9642002	9643664	All right, we have the contestants logged in.
9643704	9644724	Starting off with Tyrant.
9645945	9649528	Miyako was so depressed she got drugged and pulled to the island with her classmates to do Battle Royale.
9649548	9651890	The weapon she was given was, Tyrant says, a trout.
9652611	9653632	Like IRC, get it?
9653672	9654192	A trout.
9654712	9655273	Ha, ha, ha.
9655353	9656334	Okay, that was a cute answer.
9656354	9656834	I like that.
9657455	9657755	All right.
9659202	9663827	Nostyla says the weapon she was given was a magic kicky dicky in the Nikki.
9668672	9670094	Oh, Nikki, please, not so quicky.
9670534	9670835	Okay.
9671936	9672296	Wow.
9674198	9675820	Loki, your answer, please.

9679043	9680505	Iraqi suicide babies.
9683217	9683517	Awesome.
9683557	9685519	Anybody that used to listen to this show would get that joke.
9685979	9690983	I said the weapon she was given was a bad joke book authored by 23rd Magus.
9691203	9691784	Not a match.
9691884	9692244	Sorry.
9692304	9693385	No, she'd win.

9702111	9704313	A multi-purpose magic banana.
9706415	9707916	A multi-purpose magic banana.
9707936	9711699	She probably would be too preoccupied with that and get caught in a danger zone and her collar would explode.
9713623	9715764	Mine was a Yoko Ono CD and a CD player.
9716464	9717245	Oh, very nice.
9717525	9719726	There's a lot of this theme of, like, hearing things.
9719946	9726969	Well, if you think about it, though, with the collar, it'd be worth explosive orgasm.
9730030	9734572	I said... A 50-foot dildo.
9735512	9736993	I actually said a spike dildo.
9737453	9738433	Oh, a spike dildo.
9738693	9739133	Not a match.
9740034	9740454	Gladly.
9741701	9742602	But nail clippers.
9743282	9744143	Nail clippers!
9744923	9747005	So she can keep good hygiene, but not a match.

9749827	9750227	What?
9751388	9752289	A monkey launcher.

9754731	9755131	Alright.
9759254	9762697	Okay, so not a match for either contestant, sorry.
9762737	9763117	I'm tired.
9765616	9771738	No, in the book, they have different weapons than in the movie, and someone got a sticky dart gun.
9772098	9775578	No, got a dart board and darts as their weapon.
9776939	9777759	Alright.
9777899	9778579	Moving on, here we go.
9780059	9780660	Still one apiece.
9781180	9785661	Francine, the fanfic writer, was getting impatient for the next Harry Potter book.
9786681	9788682	So she decided to write it herself.
9789102	9790502	But she couldn't think of a good name.
9791536	9795099	Finally, she decided to name it Harry Potter and the Blank.
9807190	9811554	Francine, the fanfic writer, was getting impatient for the next Harry Potter book, so she decided to write it herself.
9812094	9813235	But she couldn't think of a good name.
9813776	9817279	Finally, she decided to call it and name it Harry Potter and the Blank.
9820858	9826603	Tell Buck I know.
9826623	9829405	She decided to name it Harry Potter and the blank.
9855494	9857995	I'm just waiting for both contestants to lock in with an answer here.
9858095	9860796	Finally, she decided to name it Harry Potter in the blank.
9862857	9863517	I need an answer too.
9874437	9874797	All right.
9881760	9882520	Okay, here we go.
9882560	9882800	Ready?
9883100	9883621	Are we all ready?
9883901	9884121	Yes.
9884141	9884941	Ding, ding.
9885601	9886101	Everybody's dinged.
9886121	9886382	All right.
9886442	9893604	Nostylan says... She decided to call it Harry Potter Gone Wild with a Bomb in a Can of Some Sort.
9895245	9895825	Okay.
9896525	9899687	DJ Tyrant says, Harry Potter and a Breast Implant.
9902468	9902808	Loki...
9904022	9904642	See if we get a match.
9906143	9907223	Damn, I have like two.
9909204	9911284	Well, since they're both not matching anyways.
9911324	9918207	Harry Potter and the Horny Catholic Priest or Harry Potter and the Sex Change.
9919487	9920908	But I like Horny Catholic Priest better.
9920988	9923408	The sex change would be kind of close.
9923609	9924569	That would be like a half point.
9925441	9928582	Bohorny Catholic Priest was your first pick.
9929142	9933502	I was kind of stretched for an answer, so I used a good classic inside joke.
9934163	9936243	I said Harry Potter and the Stars Infested Monkeys.
9938923	9939183	Joey?
9940924	9943144	Harry Potter and the Search for Sexual Release.
9945184	9945705	Nice.
9946505	9946825	Jamie?
9947485	9954186	I said, and people who actually are fans of the book would get it, and it also fits in with the show, Harry Potter and the Magical Bouncing Ferret.
9965797	9983064	Harry Potter and the Swedish Furniture Harry Potter and the Swedish Furniture, good answer, but not a match Harry Potter and the Puss Filled Acne of Doom Appropriate, but not a match Punk Night Harry Potter and the Pile of Dead Babies
9985458	9987019	Not a match, I'm so sorry.
9989120	9991181	Alright, here we go, two more questions to go.
9991221	9992942	Will they break the tie of one to one?
9993002	9994723	Probably not, but let's keep playing anyway.
9994763	9995223	Here we go.
9998104	10003707	Perry the Painter was working on his new masterpiece and ran out of a few of his paints.

10067245	10067946	Oh, we have one.
10071344	10073406	And I'm waiting on one more.
10073426	10081231	Yeah, I think we have it.
10081271	10081771	Let me check.
10084773	10085173	Beautiful.
10085714	10086454	Alright, here we go.
10087315	10088636	Whose answer do you guys want to hear first?
10088756	10089656	Tyrants or no stylings?
10090877	10091257	Tyrant!
10091517	10091918	Tyrant!
10093399	10097101	Tyrant said Perry the Painter was working on his new masterpiece and ran out of a few of his paints.
10097141	10099743	He was almost done, so to replace the missing paints he used...
10100757	10101858	Puss from Zitz.
10106420	10113364	NoStylin says, to replace the paints he used the jizz and then afterwards decided to fap to some Orange Lounge Radio.
10114625	10114985	Aww.
10115005	10115685	Aww, how lovely.
10115705	10116806	Way to show your love.
10117406	10119047	Alright, uh, Loki.
10121549	10123850	Um, he used Club Baby Seals.
10128385	10129245	Nice, but not a match.
10130426	10133306	I said he ran out of paint, so he decided to use skin.
10134046	10134426	Not a match.
10136287	10137007	I'm just being morbid.
10139168	10142028	You know, I was going to use jizz myself, but then I decided to just use blood.
10143989	10144689	So simple.
10144909	10145369	Not a match.
10145629	10146009	Jamie.

10440979	10442160	Practical, but not a match.
10445000	10447081	She took a trip to Dig Up Grandpa.
10447361	10449821	She took a trip to Dig Up Grandpa.
10450742	10452602	Beautiful, but not a match.
10454683	10455083	All right.
10455223	10457563	Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah.
10457583	10460724	So, the final score is DJ Tyrant.
10461164	10461684	One point.
10462845	10463545	No styling.
10463705	10464265	One point.
10465545	10467346	So, who do we want to win?
10467406	10468306	Who do we want to win?
10470475	10471556	Yeah, that's right, you know what?
10471596	10473979	When they tie, that means we win.
10474019	10475861	So congratulations, Orange Lodge Radio.
10477362	10479024	Beat the chat room, because we're better.
10479525	10481267	Just kidding, just kidding, stay, stay.
10483308	10488811	I forgot to mention for my birthday, well this is probably something for the afterbirth, but I got erotic magnets.
10489611	10491072	Erotic poetry magnets.
10491872	10495034	You can make... Because they're not on the fridge.
10495054	10498456	Because people need to be creative and put erotic phrases on the fridge.
10498516	10504479	I'll go do one right now.
10505460	10509922	Alright, I have no time to take a break, so I need to wrap up what's the news I wanted to get to.
10510854	10514236	Bomani News, here we go, last three minutes of the show, we have some Bomani News.
10516898	10520160	More US home version songs have been confirmed for Max 2.
10520240	10520820	Here they are.
10520920	10522441	Loki will be surprised at some of these.
10523201	10524182	Feeling of Love.
10524802	10525783	Oh my god!
10527644	10528585	Max Unlimited.
10529285	10529805	Surprise.
10529846	10531867	More Deep, version 2.1.
10532487	10533208	A good song.
10533348	10534308	And Xenon.
10536510	10537470	Max 2, that'll be interesting.
10539031	10540132	DDR Ultra Mix.
10541417	10543677	Castles in the Sky will be in DDR Ultramix.
10543697	10544618	That's Ian Vandal.
10546358	10548618	Colors by DJ Taka and Sugaru.
10550299	10558020	Also in other news on DDR Freak right now, they're having people suggest songs that you would like to see in Ultramix.
10558040	10561681	It's probably one of those packs you have to buy for songs and whatnot.
10562221	10564222	So go there and do that.
10565782	10571206	DDR Max 2 is going to have an all new updated system for the diet mode.
10571246	10579293	They're going to have workout courses you can do, like low impact, high impact, I'm lazy, that type of thing.
10581034	10581955	Some fun stuff like that.
10582175	10584917	And you're probably going to see Max Period at some point in there.
10586719	10589741	That's the dumbest name for a freaking song I've ever seen.
10590489	10591271	You know what's interesting?
10591331	10595883	I'm noticing more and more that Max 2 is basically a US version of Xtreme.
10596023	10596585	It really is.
10597006	10598630	It's a US version of the Japanese Xtreme.
10598730	10599573	So that means it's going to suck.
10600302	10603684	No, I think it's actually going to be really good because we've already all played Xtreme.
10604244	10606686	You know what's interesting though?
10606806	10607926	We played the demo.
10608527	10610428	Loki and I played the demo for Max 2 USA.
10610468	10610828	We have it.
10611108	10612289	And we were playing D2R.
10612349	10615430	The first thing I noticed is that D2R has Xtreme's video.
10615831	10617532	It doesn't have the D2R video for Max 2.
10617932	10619112	Because they're different.
10619333	10619813	Yes, they are.
10620353	10624055	In Xtreme, I recognize one of the videos.
10624095	10627797	It's like a matrix effect where you have the numbers changing while it's running down the screen.
10628077	10628738	That was in Max 2.
10629578	10630018	No, it wasn't.
10630219	10631459	But it wasn't in the D2R video.
10632620	10633601	I'm almost positive.
10633621	10636843	I'm like 99% positive that D2R has a new video in this.
10637123	10639885	It has the Extremes video, not Max 2's video.
10639925	10640645	It doesn't really matter.
10640685	10641446	It's a background video.
10641826	10642286	Yeah, I know.
10642467	10648110	Not that we really give a shit, but that makes me think that, oh, it's based off Extremes Engine, not Max 2.
10649291	10650892	Well, didn't... Whatever.
10651092	10653634	Well, I thought they said that... It's based off of Euromix 2.
10653674	10653974	Ew!
10653994	10655335	It's not an engine.
10657630	10659992	I had a point I wanted to make.
10661412	10675459	Also in Extreme, they've announced that most of the unlocks from the arcade, I'm not going to read the whole list, but pretty much anything that was unlocked by a code in the arcade, songs such as Sync, Dance Dance Revolution, Paranoia Survivor, etc.
10675619	10676259	is a hidden track.
10680120	10684441	Pixie Dust is suggesting your mama's on crack rock should be in DDR Max 2.
10685422	10687022	You should go suggest that in the DDR pre-credits.
10687042	10690503	That is the best suggestion ever to be in DDR.
10690963	10693064	Not my mama, my mama in rehab.
10694324	10695404	That song was the best.
10695504	10698345	I have like on a tape that I made when I was in middle school.
10700985	10701786	What a lovely thought.
10701826	10702886	I'm going to go download that tonight.
10705586	10708167	Okay, any other Bomani news anyone had to report?
10708227	10709527	I mean, we've got the game.
10709587	10711448	The game is out in a week and a half, Max 2.
10711848	10718110	And Wednesday night, a week from Wednesday, we're going to do what we did for Max 1.
10718150	10718930	We're going to play it.
10719050	10721611	We're going to just bring home the copy and play it on air.
10723292	10727573	Although I believe it's actually being released on Tuesday, right?
10728297	10730818	This Wednesday we're going to have some surprise programming.
10731359	10731599	Who knows?
10757751	10759313	Now is the part of the show, I believe.
10759373	10763296	It's time to go around and gather everyone's final thoughts, I think.
10765617	10766898	Unless anyone else has Bomani's?
10766938	10768600	No, they need to have the Ohaska.
10772903	10773523	That would be cool.
10775885	10776165	Okay.
10778447	10779248	Final thoughts time.
10779628	10780228	I guess we're there.
10780509	10781990	Unless anybody else has anything they want to bring up?
10785575	10787036	Good, we can end this train wreck of a show.
10787816	10788057	What?
10789157	10790078	Play endearing music.
10790098	10791159	Play endearing music.
10791179	10791419	Like what?
10791939	10797223	I don't, why do you, why do you Give me a final thought, dammit.
10797283	10798243	Give me a final thought.
10798263	10798884	Uh, College Rules.
10800665	10801025	Lovely.
10801645	10802806	Bradley, do you have a final thought?
10803707	10805508	Uh, slam it, cram it, jam it, dammit.
10807529	10808070	Okay.
10809330	10809931	Punk Night.
10810931	10811512	Muzzletuff.
10812432	10812933	I hate you.
10817895	10818215	Jamie.
10818455	10819937	Oh, Joey, do you have a final thought?
10820457	10821358	No, he has no final thought.
10822639	10823440	What, you want to go last?
10824421	10827804	My final thought is... Yay.
10829025	10829325	Loki.
10831787	10834089	I'm going to have an arcade cabinet and you don't.
10834169	10836211	I'm going to have an arcade cabinet and you don't.
10838653	10840534	My final thought, and I have a microphone.
10840554	10841415	Knee-er, knee-er, knee-er.
10841555	10843897	Well, you know, I'm going to have one when I get my house, so...
10846535	10851657	My final thought is go to your local game shop and pre-order Transformers Season 3 box set.
10852897	10856119	And sign up for roleplay.darksakura.com.
10856359	10862421	And right after the show at 10pm, be sure to tune in to Conan O'Brien's 10th Anniversary Special.
10863041	10862421	9.30.
10863301	10865182	9.30.
10864181	10865182	Right now.
10865262	10865602	Right now.
10865822	10866662	On your TV.
10868923	10871244	Alright, so I guess that's a sign we need to end this show then.
10872637	10873878	The final word of the show.
10874198	10875159	I'll give it to Joey.
10875820	10876681	He gets one word.
10876721	10878662	You say one word and it's the final word of the show.
10878702	10879883	So what is the final word of the show?
10881285	10881705	Peace.
