302782	306702	Toto, I think we're not in Kansas anymore.
310157	312718	You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
313078	315039	Mamani Talk, and then some.
315719	318420	Uh, mostly the, and then some, part of that.
318801	322802	Orange Lounge Radio is created by a bunch of potty-mouthed adults.
323443	328245	Orange Lounge may contain sexual, perverted, and mildly retarded content.
328825	332506	You probably shouldn't let your children listen to Orange Lounge Radio.
332626	334087	Yes, I will spank your child.
334487	336208	If you're not going to do your job, goddammit, I will.
340988	343049	Well, here's to my big opening.
343590	344730	A sphincter says what?
344990	346992	I'm super, thanks for asking.
347372	349953	Oh, you little bitch troll from hell.
349993	351154	What am I doing here?
351174	351814	Dodge this.
357750	360252	Look, you stupid bastard, you've got no arms left.
360432	361073	Yes, I have.
361493	363314	Look, there's a flesh wound.
363534	369779	Searching for a boy in high school is as useless as searching for meaning in a Pauly Shore movie.
370719	371260	Oh, yeah?
371480	374882	Well, I hope your babies look like monkeys.
375062	376103	DarkSakura.
376343	377264	I've had a sniff.
377464	378004	Skye.
378104	380226	But I'm playing it for the bartender, so suffer.
380586	381106	Loki.
381367	382407	I hate you.
382787	384168	Orange Lounge Radio.
384188	384429	Nice.
386656	392758	We are live, and this is episode number .59 for September the 7th of 2003.
394919	396299	I made a .59 joke.
397720	398140	Nerd.
399700	404302	You're tuned into the Be Money Scene's most glompy radio station of all things Be Money.
405002	407323	My name is Rob Roberts, but you might know me as Sky.
408343	410804	Joining me, as always, are my awesome co-hosts.
410924	413965	In this corner, the happiest bunny on the farm is Jamie Summers.
414485	415166	I want to nap.
416474	418135	You know her better as DarkSakura.
419796	421797	Or today, it's NappySakura.
422237	423218	She needs to take a nap.
423698	425819	What?
428841	430022	It's BabySakura.
430562	435785	I'm going to kick your ass in a moment.
435825	437426	I'll be contagious if you watch.
437506	438987	It's AngryBabySakura.
440528	443029	In that corner, say hello to our TechMassa, Loki.
443049	444330	Hello.
444350	444510	Hello.
447285	449467	Also with us tonight we have... Air.
449887	450408	Nobody!
450908	451589	No, we have air.
452230	452770	We have air.
453050	453911	We have particles.
454131	460136	See, if I'd had that song chewed up, I could have played air and made another funny Bomani joke, like two jokes in 60 seconds.
460717	464600	We have germs and other single-celled organisms.
464660	465601	We are not alone here.
465621	467343	And a fart of mine in the back of the room.
468564	474029	And by making those two Bomani jokes in a row, you would have qualified for the quota for us to kill you.
477003	477704	I'm so excited.
477744	480346	I have a blunt object somewhere around here I could beat you with.
481227	482127	You have the microphone.
482388	482968	Where's the ferret?
483328	483809	You know what?
483909	487452	One of them's... I think... I think they're missing.
488072	489854	I honestly... And I didn't kill them, I swear.
489914	490935	I think they're missing.
490955	491796	They're around here somewhere.
491836	492336	They gotta be.
494478	496359	We'll have to go on a ferret hunt later.
497420	500263	You're gonna hunt to save it, and I'm gonna hunt to kill it.
500323	502825	I'll just make you smell my shoe.
502845	502885	Um...
505914	506855	We'll be back.
506915	509779	We're a little dead tonight, so it's going to be an interesting show.
511741	514164	DarkSakura's kind of feeling a little under the weather, I think.
514504	516426	Hooray for upper respiratory infections.
516526	517688	Hooray for ear infections.
521372	522333	Oh, that perked her right up.
523835	526498	Does that mean the cure for the common cold is a nice, friendly ferret?
527322	528863	I am happy and full of spirit.
528943	529804	Loki, you are evil.
531545	534548	I'm feeling kind of, I'm feeling tired too.
534628	537430	I've done nothing but really nap, like all week long.
543434	544375	I love that sound.
544495	545576	That makes me go squee.
546178	546818	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
579291	579974	Thanks for watching!
674344	675485	Thanks for watching!

895242	901826	Nico Meow, Nico Meow, Nico Meow, Nico Meow, Meow, Meow Oh, ass!
902347	923381	This randomness could only be brought to you by Orange Lounge Hello everybody and welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio In that sense you heard .59 appropriate because this is the 59th show of Orange Lounge Radio And Yamato with 2002 Does that mean we're heavenly?
925169	926610	This show is heavenly.
927011	927471	Ha ha.
927611	928612	Except we're all going to hell.
928832	929433	I made a joke.
929833	930254	Ha ha.
930674	931074	Yay.
932095	933056	Tengoku joke.
933697	934117	Ha ha.
934818	942985	And I was going to make it an all numbers set, but Jamie really wanted to hear Ninzaburro and that didn't sound like such a bad idea, so you had a couple numbered songs and then Ninzaburro.
946428	947209	Ninzaburro's cool.
948146	950787	Yeah, I'm still trying to find episodes of the show.
951027	952607	It sounded a little fast to you, huh?
952927	953227	Yeah.
969891	975134	And especially in 4th Mix, like, remember how fast Dropout seemed in 4th Mix?
975154	977655	Because Dropout was like the max 300 of its time, right?
977955	980156	It was just like, oh my god, the arrows are coming up so fast.
980885	986988	When you go and you play Dropout on Max 2 or something, you're like, oh, this is easy.
987528	988649	Dropout's easy.
988709	992630	And it's weird how much that frame rate totally changed things.
993010	1001134	So I think that's why Ninzaburro maybe... Well, then again, of course, that goes reverse my philosophy because then Ninzaburro would have played faster.
1001214	1001634	I don't know.
1002655	1007577	Well, I guess it depends if you played it on 4th or 5th mix because 5th mix is when the frame rate started to change.
1009438	1009738	I don't know.
1010563	1011865	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1026339	1028041	The beginning of the week was okay.
1028501	1032665	Well, I think it was really good because that's when Marin Chan and Rick were here.
1033305	1033786	Oh, yes.
1034346	1036888	And had a very good time.
1037349	1046217	The air conditioner went out, though, on Sunday night, or during the day on Sunday, and it was out Monday, and it was out Tuesday, and it was out Wednesday.
1047317	1050060	And it was really hot on Wednesday.
1050100	1052322	I went to work, and I was feeling just wretched.
1052962	1054183	But I made it through my day of work.
1054903	1055824	I mean, sorry, Tuesday.
1056284	1057905	I went back to work and I was feeling really crappy.
1058745	1061887	And I went to work Wednesday and was feeling even worse.
1063147	1067690	And then when I went into work Thursday, I don't remember the entire drive to work.
1067790	1068870	And that's not a good sign.
1069831	1071732	You didn't fall asleep during the drive, did you?
1071892	1072272	I don't know.
1072852	1073493	I don't remember.
1074828	1079250	and, um, I was having bad dizzy spells and finally I just, you know, asked, I asked if I could go home.
1079290	1080210	I was not feeling good at all.
1080490	1089534	I was running a fever and, um, I was feel, I, I remember driving home but I had dizzy spells on the way home which, you know, good thing there was light traffic.
1090594	1100658	Um, so I, I got home and scheduled my, and, and everyone knows me, I don't go to the doctor unless I have to and I scheduled myself an appointment for the doctor that night and, uh,
1101158	1105641	Turns out that I have a respiratory infection and an ear infection in my right ear.
1106321	1108483	I am no longer contagious, which is good for you guys.
1109063	1110184	That's a very good sign, thank you.
1110204	1112846	Because I've been on antibiotics now all weekend.
1113546	1116408	I'm going to be on antibiotics for the rest of the week and after that.
1116428	1120711	How about getting off of these antibiotics?
1122352	1128036	I am on this stuff that I have to put up my nose and squirt and it burns.
1128936	1129817	It smells like burning.
1131287	1139893	And, um... And I'm on my inhaler again for Abuderal, which I was supposed to get six refills of it, and I only got, like, zero.
1140494	1146878	So I'm going to have to make sure that it wasn't my doctor's, you know, doctor handwriting, which is basic doctor handwriting.
1147779	1156525	Um... I, uh... I was feeling a lot better, though, on Friday after sleeping for about 15 hours.
1156605	1156765	And, uh...
1160430	1161591	and did my thing that day.
1163552	1178242	Yesterday, though, I got up at the butt cracker dawn, which is about 10 in the morning for me, and made it over to Iguana Girl's house and a bunch of us all went to see Weird Al in Madeira.
1178642	1179463	How's Moo doing?
1180083	1181264	Moo is so cute.
1181805	1183025	Moo's got a big belly.
1184126	1186768	Moo is Iguana Girl's iguana.
1188101	1192683	We also have a regular chatter named Moo, and we have a Mooheimer.
1194044	1195205	This is Moo the Cute.
1195225	1196265	There's lots of Moos.
1196365	1197366	Moo the Cute Iguana.
1198887	1201088	And Moo was being antsy all day.
1201128	1204870	Moo was being a little butt, but that's okay because Moo is cute.
1206691	1213054	And Melody came with us, which was really awesome.
1214423	1214984	DarkSakura.com
1229568	1231169	Because there was like happy everywhere.
1231189	1232050	It looks like happy.
1232250	1233691	Well, certainly this week anyway.
1233711	1235152	Did you hear about what happened at Disneyland?
1236413	1237253	That's pretty damn funny.
1238114	1240596	And we were talking about it too on the trip.
1240696	1244819	We were talking about it on the trip and we think it's just because the guy was doing something stupid.
1245139	1250202	Because he was up in the front and we think he was trying to get into the train.
1252044	1254565	Like he was trying to jump from the train into another one or something?
1254726	1257688	No, trying to get into the front part.
1258028	1258128	Oh.
1260990	1266694	I still think it's that guy's fault.
1268175	1271297	Let's just blame it on that guy.
1272918	1275740	It's a little kid who threw gum on a track or something like that.
1275980	1277761	Even better, let's blame it on a little kid.
1277821	1278742	Stupid children.
1279442	1281784	That child is a murderer and should be hung.
1282004	1282424	Anyway, um...
1287108	1289409	Back to... Whoa, you know, that's kind of neat in the chatroom.
1289429	1290429	It looks like a little curvy.
1290449	1293210	It looks like a big nose, like Mario's nose or something.
1293570	1293810	What?
1294450	1296631	I was looking at the curve that the text took in the chatroom.
1296651	1297471	It was kind of neat looking.
1297991	1299572	Anyway, um... Okay.
1300172	1301372	Jamie's going crazy.
1301792	1302493	Fuck you.
1302873	1304673	Jamie's taking a little too many meds.
1307254	1307974	Bomber ferret.
1308555	1309035	You see this?
1309095	1309675	It's mine now.
1309715	1310835	Give me a ferret!
1310915	1311355	It's mine.
1311395	1312436	Give me a ferret!
1312456	1313196	You have a ferret.
1314381	1318742	I have my own favorite.
1318762	1322683	Tell your story.
1322703	1329004	We all sat in our seats and everything and had to go find Julie and Krista and Becky and all them who weren't going to meet us there.
1329304	1330125	People you don't know.
1330285	1332285	Listeners of Orange Ones Radio.
1332545	1333965	Julie's been in the chat room before.
1334185	1334926	Oh, that's true.
1334946	1335246	That's right.
1335266	1335586	That's right.
1335606	1335866	She has.
1336386	1336646	My bad.
1338357	1344918	Anyway, Weird Al was awesome and fabulous and there were these stupid fuckers around us smoking, them getting to that later.
1346118	1346798	I had they die.
1346838	1347979	Smoking crack or what?
1348019	1350339	And then there were these sluts in the row in front of us, I swear.
1350759	1352199	They were like trying to out-hoochie each other.
1352219	1353640	Wait, sluts don't listen to Weird Al.
1353960	1356640	No, no, they were in the front row and they were being sluts.
1356660	1359041	They were all trying to out-slut each other.
1360161	1366062	Trying to be like super skank and everything and he was making fun of them the whole show.
1366202	1366682	It was great.
1368883	1379756	And, uh, and he was, but because he went to see one of the sluts that was in front of us to make fun of her, you know, during, uh, uh, the, uh, what is the song called?
1379796	1383961	The, uh, the one where he's going through all of the, the pickup lines?
1384947	1385348	I don't know.
1386209	1387030	I don't listen to enough Weird Al.
1387090	1389252	I like Weird Al, but I don't follow him enough.
1389272	1392256	He was right in front of us, so I got a good look at him and everything.
1392276	1395199	I took a picture of the back of his head during one more minute.
1395780	1397181	So wait, you guys were in the second row?
1397602	1400966	Well, there was the priority seating in front of us that was about six.
1401906	1403247	Rose are all blocked off.
1403828	1407271	But he came into our area, too, to make fun of the sluts, I guess.
1407992	1410194	He went way back in the whole paid seating area.
1410234	1410774	It was great.
1410854	1411315	That's cool.
1411335	1414097	So pay for your tickets when you go to the fair.
1414137	1415018	You'll get good seats.
1415298	1418861	Loki, they went to Fresno at the Madera County Fair.
1419842	1421063	But today was Great America.
1421123	1422024	I'm surprised you didn't go.
1422444	1422945	Because it's $40.
1423025	1423646	Not you, Loki. $50.
1426567	1430189	I was going to go, but that was supposed to be for my birthday.
1430389	1434670	But yeah, no one took me.
1436771	1438512	I didn't know you wanted to go.
1438552	1441053	I would have taken him to... I had this planned for a month and a half.
1441773	1442013	I know.
1443794	1443974	But...
1444773	1446314	You guys all piled in a van, right?
1446435	1451499	Yeah, Vandalist took us in his van, his SUV.
1452320	1455323	It was a comfy SUV, too, and I sort of slept on the way back.
1457044	1463110	But it was a really fun time, and it was funny watching the skanks try to out-skank each other.
1464070	1466112	This one girl decided that she had to dance every time.
1466132	1469996	She was like, sit your stupid skinny butt down, you're ugly.
1471800	1472820	Did you say she was ugly?
1473200	1474961	No, we just were like, Hey, down in front!
1475041	1477723	And she's like, Oh, I'm sorry, I'm stupid.
1478183	1478643	And sat down.
1480264	1483146	But he did... He changed the Yoda chant.
1484166	1486868	Well, not really changed it, but more like expanded it.
1486888	1487488	It was pretty cool.
1487528	1489329	And for those that don't know what the Yoda chant is?
1489770	1492111	I don't remember how to do the whole Yoda chant.
1492391	1494372	If you've been to a Weird Al show, you know the Yoda chant.
1496413	1496894	He did...
1498070	1504274	He did that stupid... He did the stinky song that was making fun of that stupid person Nelly.
1505736	1506216	Oh, yeah.
1506236	1507657	That guy I hate.
1508758	1512620	It's getting hot in here, so take off all your clothes.
1512640	1513181	Yeah, I know that one.
1513201	1514762	They put a bunch of trash cans on the stage.
1514822	1515302	It was great.
1515883	1517084	And they did All About the Pentiums.
1518945	1521206	And did, of course, One More Minute.
1521226	1522888	Is it just me or is Weird Al getting old?
1523848	1524309	Shut up.
1524589	1524749	Shut up.
1525422	1527124	Is he, is he, he's got a baby.
1527424	1529025	I know, well he didn't have the baby.
1529125	1530266	Well his wife had the baby.
1530767	1535250	But still like I saw him in an interview recently and I'm like, weird how he's getting old.
1535811	1536672	It was weird.
1537392	1538373	You're getting old too.
1538593	1541976	I know, we're all getting old, but he's getting like really old.
1542677	1544718	I still kind of look like my yearbook picture.
1544738	1546400	He doesn't look very old at all.
1547180	1549802	He did the funniest, he did some of his parody interviews.
1550362	1550662	Uh-huh.
1550962	1553924	He did, um... I'm moving out in the living room so people can see me on webcam if they want.
1553984	1561148	He did one with, uh, with Justin Timberlake and Brittany on the TV.
1561208	1561788	It was great.
1561888	1563849	Justin Timberlake is such a suck.
1563869	1565710	The best one was the Celine Dion one.
1566071	1566371	Oh, shit.
1566411	1573975	He's like, well, I know when you were a child you had this traumatic experience where you're going skiing and your whole family was eaten by cannibals.
1574475	1577417	He's like, yes, I remember the smell of my mother cooking.
1577957	1579718	He's like, I bet it was horrible for you.
1580058	1580839	No, it was fun.
1583080	1584380	And the Avril Lavigne one.
1585341	1587142	He's like, say something incoherently for us.
1587382	1589343	Well, I don't think, you know, she's going off on something.
1589363	1590064	It was really great.
1591284	1593906	And it was, the interviews were great.
1594366	1597288	You know, this is actually, I think the one tonight is his last show of the tour.
1598408	1598668	Oh, yeah.
1598688	1599869	So all you people missed out.
1602381	1604242	Here's Jamie's chance to rub it in.
1606964	1607664	With a ferret.
1609525	1613568	So, Weird Al, skanks, good songs, good time.
1614028	1616090	I have pictures, and I took pictures of the fireworks.
1616110	1618471	Tell me about where you guys went to eat, because this is a funny story.
1619071	1620072	We ate at IHOP.
1620873	1622053	I told you about IHOP.
1622113	1622914	You told me about it.
1623034	1623554	Did you tell them?
1623614	1625115	I said it's the happiest place on Earth.
1625175	1626156	I said it's the only thing.
1626616	1627797	But you didn't let me finish.
1629631	1634134	and I hope it was the happiest place on earth because it looked like happy up and threw up all over it.
1635035	1638358	It's like happy decided to pop and go, oh, I'm happy, happy, puke.
1639218	1640979	And the whole place was covered in happy faces.
1641040	1642020	So it looked like a Walmart.
1642481	1642781	Yeah.
1643161	1644942	Walmart is not a happy place to sleep.
1645062	1649386	It made Walmart look like the sewer.
1651269	1653990	The rat-infested sewer that it is.
1654070	1655131	With skanks.
1655191	1656832	I'll talk about that later, much later.
1658072	1659333	I have issues with Walmart this week.
1660814	1662735	But it was too happy.
1662795	1669518	And then today, we got home at like 3.30, long enough for me to do a little post-lit in my live journal.
1669538	1671839	And then I passed out and was dead for...
1672403	1672984	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1695265	1695765	Smiley face.
1696225	1697605	And it had pumpkin syrup.
1698266	1698946	Oh, it was so good.
1699706	1700166	So today?
1700946	1702446	Oh, pumpkin.
1702907	1704807	Today, I felt like shit.
1705427	1708628	I felt like shit when I went home because I'm still sick and I shouldn't have gone.
1709268	1711268	And I had to go along the livestock.
1711288	1712629	But I got to shoot a man yesterday.
1713529	1714169	Oh, yeah.
1714389	1716509	You shot a guy like 33 times?
1716709	1717730	They had a paintball thing.
1718450	1719530	And I was shooting little targets.
1719550	1720570	I shot a bunny in the head.
1721630	1724731	And I shot a teddy bear in the ass.
1726057	1733402	I was shooting all the small targets and then I decided to use my last 20 or so shots on the man himself who was just standing there all padded up.
1734023	1734763	I got him in the head.
1734783	1736184	And it was a real guy?
1736204	1736965	Real guy.
1737005	1738466	All bundled up in paintball gear.
1738946	1739647	I shot him in the head.
1740947	1741728	I shot him in his heart.
1742388	1743369	I shot him in his groin.
1744110	1747292	I shot him in the right kneecap enough to make him back up a step.
1748633	1751835	And then I shot him a bunch of other places and I think I shot him in the eyeball once.
1752555	1754016	But he was wearing goggles so it wasn't much fun.
1754036	1754957	Hmm.
1755478	1756578	I was like, oh, no more?
1757919	1760880	Wasn't there a little heckler there, too, that was telling you to shut up?
1760940	1762241	I told him to shut up.
1762581	1763421	Some stupid little kid.
1763441	1764582	You can curse on Orange Hawn's radio.
1764622	1764862	It's okay.
1764882	1765902	I don't feel like cursing.
1766042	1767943	I feel like being clean today because I'm sick.
1768924	1771104	You know I'm sick when I'm talking like a good little girl.
1771485	1771965	Fuck him.
1772845	1774046	Stupid little kid, okay?
1774566	1775246	Stupid little kid.
1776627	1777327	You can hit it.
1777467	1777947	Hit the guy.
1777967	1778227	Hit the guy.
1778247	1778948	Don't hit the little things.
1778968	1779328	Hit the guy.
1779388	1779788	Hit the man.
1779848	1781149	I'm like, okay.
1781169	1781749	This was while...
1782879	1783739	Vandalis is going.
1784260	1787581	I told the kid, okay, don't talk when I'm shooting or I'll shoot you.
1788201	1788841	I didn't say that.
1788861	1792102	I was like, do me a favor, kid, don't talk when I'm shooting.
1792622	1793323	But it's fine.
1793343	1794783	I was like, no, it's not.
1794823	1797404	I would have turned that gun right around and opened fire.
1797784	1800305	Oh, the thing was so touchy.
1800745	1802406	I could have had that thing go, die.
1804432	1805693	It was a very touchy gun.
1806594	1807795	But we all shot people.
1807915	1808296	It was good.
1808496	1811098	I've done that with a water gun, but they only turn so far.
1811398	1816142	You can't really shoot your neighbor, but you can get a stream going kind of sideways, and you can flick water on your neighbor.
1816183	1820026	I could have pulled this thing completely out and gone on a murderous paintball rampage.
1820987	1821807	Why would you?
1822548	1824730	Because there weren't enough children around.
1824770	1827512	Just that one kid, and he wasn't worth me wasting the ammo I paid for.
1827532	1829214	So, um...
1831724	1834126	It was a good time, and today I felt really, really crappy.
1834146	1842611	I took a picture of a cow that was acting like a cat, hunched down like Shermie does, turning around and licking his shoulder.
1842891	1846053	When Licklick, I'm cute, I think I'm a cat, but I'm really a cow, boo.
1847334	1849995	And we came up with retarded animal sounds.
1850736	1851256	Moo!
1852677	1853017	Moo!
1854038	1855339	I think that was... Okay.
1856099	1860702	We were in the IHOP going, yay, and then talking about animals.
1861917	1865899	Somebody was saying earlier in the chat room that Weird Al should be in Bomani.
1866280	1866580	No.
1867000	1868001	No, I don't think so either.
1868041	1869722	I don't want Bomani to ruin Weird Al.
1870722	1872923	But Weird Al should do a parody of a Bomani song.
1873664	1873824	No.
1874704	1875165	I think he should.
1876826	1878487	He'd make, like, Love Me Do the Polka.
1879747	1881348	That would be great, a Bomani polka.
1881408	1881748	Come on.
1882229	1883349	Tell me that would not be beautiful.
1883710	1884570	I don't think he'd do it.
1889099	1890980	I, I, I, I'm your little butterfly
1917331	1920872	and Melody took a nap with Shermie.
1921912	1922092	Aww.
1922752	1927953	And I bummed around online and then she went home but she's coming back because her laptop's at my house.
1928833	1933134	So we'll have a special surprise visit from Shark Skrull in a little while.
1933974	1934614	Surprise!
1935375	1937375	Surprise!
1937535	1940916	So I might have to leave a bit early but I'm doing other things here too.
1943366	1945467	Um, yeah, my clothes are visiting, too.
1945827	1947248	Yes, LankyStyle has it.
1947288	1949109	He says, Superstar Pokestyle.
1949149	1949609	No!
1950990	1951270	No.
1951330	1952130	My name is Chaos.
1952750	1954191	I'm here to do it.
1956412	1959494	That earned you a fap in the head by the ferret.
1960174	1961475	Did you say a fap in the head?
1961495	1962575	I said a fap.
1963275	1964356	I thought she said a fap.
1966079	1967900	Don't expect much out of me, but whining and angst
1984818	1986800	You get wine with your eggs today.
1986820	1988741	What do we expect from you usually?
1988761	1989242	Shut up.
1990563	1992845	Me to be funny and excited and bouncing and cute.
1992905	1993285	And you know what?
1993345	1995367	On top of that, I was so happy.
1995487	1997789	I mean, my purse, my little purse is dead, which pissed me off.
1998109	2000071	So I was going to use my bunny, my bunny backpack.
2000231	2001291	My bunny backpack broke.
2001732	2002272	Oh, no.
2002573	2004995	So now I have it rigged because it's the only thing I have.
2005015	2005835	I have to go buy a new purse.
2005855	2006536	I don't have any money.
2007176	2009478	And I have to put it on the credit card probably because I need a purse.
2009678	2012681	And Matt's humping the chair.
2015120	2016041	He's fapping the chair.
2016141	2017462	You're fapping the chair.
2018883	2020564	You were faced the other way.
2025047	2027809	Oh, John Fields suggests a bye-bye baby balloon polka.
2027829	2029371	A polka polka.
2029671	2029951	Yes.
2030031	2031052	I don't have energy.
2031072	2031532	Stand up.
2043445	2044986	No, no, nobody's love.
2045106	2046007	Stand up.
2046227	2046808	Stand up.
2046828	2047268	Why?
2047488	2047929	Stand up.
2047949	2048849	I don't want to stand up.
2048869	2049270	Stand up.
2049550	2050010	No.
2050110	2050531	Stand up.
2050931	2051872	I'm standing up.
2053874	2053994	Ow.
2057717	2058337	No polka.
2059218	2060819	I only want polka.
2060979	2061960	I want a joga polka.
2062000	2062200	Come on.
2062220	2063321	I want trance polka.
2065583	2067024	The beauty of silence polka.
2067545	2068485	The beauty of polka.
2072082	2073323	That's a remix you should do.
2075604	2077125	I'm sorry, I don't make crap.
2080227	2081228	Is T-Dog listening?
2081268	2083169	Maybe he could make Beauty and Polka.
2085951	2086751	Don't put it past him.
2086771	2088092	That's my new name, T-Dog.
2088772	2090954	What, for the four-letter word?
2091014	2091294	Yeah.
2091914	2092255	Mute!
2097466	2097826	Anyway.
2098307	2099547	Hi, Newt!
2099647	2101588	Is that all you have to say about your day and your week?
2101989	2103770	I think I have a fever again.
2103790	2105111	I have to go to work tomorrow.
2106611	2107352	You don't have to.
2107372	2108012	Yes, I do.
2108032	2109413	Unless you want to get fired.
2110554	2112355	I have a doctor's excuse though, so nah.
2114076	2115136	And I'm on lots of drugs.
2116397	2118438	I have to snort liquid cocaine.
2118679	2119099	Cool.
2119339	2120660	I don't know, it's called Nazarel.
2120800	2121680	It's like burns.
2123361	2126043	It's like inhaling snot, but on fire.
2127734	2128494	It's really disgusting.
2128515	2131736	Ferb is criticizing my pronunciation of Dom Dariam.
2132797	2134098	It's Dom Dariram.
2134538	2135459	Dom Dariram?
2136719	2137640	Dom Dariam?
2138080	2139121	How about Dom Dariam?
2139561	2140021	No.
2140061	2140582	Dariam.
2140682	2143243	I like Dariam because it sounds like Darier.
2143263	2144584	It's a stupid yoga song.
2145344	2146265	Stupid yoga song.
2148486	2149767	From now on... You know what?
2150147	2155050	I don't care if my pronunciation of Dom Dariam was a little odd and wrong because the British say everything odd.
2155150	2156171	So, you know what?
2156932	2157672	Shut up!
2158072	2158853	That's mean.
2160813	2161553	I'm just kidding.
2162213	2163134	Someone kick Rob.
2163634	2164154	You're closer.
2164194	2164774	Kick Rob for me.
2165154	2165534	No.
2166895	2167115	Okay.
2168215	2172356	Anyway, let's go on to Loki.
2172396	2173637	If you're done talking about your weekend.
2173657	2174777	I'm going to go tickle my laundry.
2175277	2175557	Okay.
2175937	2177718	I think your wash is done because I don't hear it spinning anymore.
2178258	2179358	In the meantime, we'll talk to Loki.
2180078	2181159	Loki, how was your weekend?
2182059	2182639	It was all right.
2182659	2183599	I didn't do anything.
2184840	2185400	Sat there.
2186229	2187249	Rodding away at work.
2190090	2191431	I won spinners tonight.
2191751	2193771	Those are going to be for my Beatmania controller.
2193931	2194772	And what is a spinner?
2195732	2196592	It's exactly that.
2196652	2197312	It spins.
2197672	2198393	It's a little controller.
2198413	2198973	Like a top?
2200473	2201073	Like a knob.
2203134	2204134	It spins like a knob.
2204294	2205155	You bought a knob.
2206235	2206835	Two knobs.
2209016	2216018	Anyways, so I bought those and then pretty much worked on my pads a little bit
2216485	2217867	Have all the metal bent on them now.
2219169	2223094	And made a remix, did some show.
2223734	2225557	Yes, we have a new Loki remix coming soon.
2226318	2227920	Tonight, at some point, yes?
2228020	2228841	I already finished it.
2229061	2230243	I finished it during the show.
2230864	2231805	Maybe next break then.
2232685	2233406	Maybe.
2233426	2234066	Maybe.
2234366	2234627	Alright.
2234827	2239090	I dedicated it to the Thunder Mountain Railroad train that crashed.
2240871	2241391	Okay.
2242052	2246535	So we have the whatever song it's going to be, Big Thunder Mountain Mix, or what is this?
2247016	2247896	I like that one better.
2247916	2249457	I want to change it.
2250258	2255042	It was just going to be called Derailed Mix, but I like the Big Thunder Mountain Mix.
2255362	2256983	How many of your remixes have I named?
2257003	2257303	Okay.
2258624	2260285	This is at least the second or third one.
2260725	2261586	I named another one.
2262306	2263167	There was another one I named.
2263307	2264528	It was the Matrix one.
2265368	2266049	Gravity Reloaded.
2267610	2267730	Eh.
2268030	2268810	Yeah, uh-huh.
2269431	2269791	I rule.
2269951	2271032	You just don't want to admit it.
2271052	2271392	Whatever.
2272489	2279171	I have money, I have to go buy the... I was shopping for a computer today for my MAME cabinet and then that was expensive so I didn't buy it.
2279371	2282773	And then I was going to shop for parts online for the MAME cabinet.
2283313	2285073	That was also expensive so I didn't buy it.
2285413	2291015	And so pretty much it's just pricing stuff right now and working on it and that kind of thing.
2291395	2295517	But anyways... Mikey Style says a spinner is a short, thin girl.
2302615	2304196	Loki buying that online?
2304276	2304616	Never.
2305456	2306096	And two of them.
2307497	2312738	No, but, um... No, Loki was talking about how he bought spinners online, and LankyStyle says, a spinner is a short, thin girl.
2315059	2320160	Because you can spin her in your lap when she's riding your cock.
2324282	2325702	Anyways... You don't have a cock!
2326742	2331984	No, but, uh... I resent that...
2332947	2338729	Because one day I'm going to invent the one that, like, women can have that... I don't... Okay.
2339510	2341470	My friend... They already have cocks for women.
2341930	2342751	The vagina cock?
2343211	2343511	No.
2343931	2353515	I have... Well, she's not really a friend, I guess, anymore, but this girl that I know who's really irresponsible and is kind of stupid, she said she wanted a dick so that she could whip it out and piss on people.
2354648	2357189	All right, we know what happens when people wish for dicks, okay?
2357389	2358650	We've already watched that movie.
2358730	2359210	I haven't.
2359370	2359990	You know what, though?
2360310	2362031	Having a dick, it isn't all that.
2362071	2365892	Because when you get a dick, yes, when you get a dick, you get balls as well.
2365952	2367073	And people can kick you there.
2367493	2369774	And imagine, like, your entire three days.
2369814	2371414	I've often said it's much better to be a woman.
2371474	2376256	Imagine your whole three days' worth of cramps piled into five seconds of intense pain.
2377397	2378977	That's what being kicked in the balls feels like.
2379197	2380858	Yeah, but the five seconds goes away.
2382731	2384372	And you have no idea what cramps feel like.
2385793	2388734	Imagine having pain that makes you puke.
2389195	2391156	Somebody once told me what having a baby felt like.
2391976	2393817	It's like pulling your lower lip over your head.
2394958	2396679	That's what somebody told me once.
2396819	2400461	It's like a family guy freaking loser.
2400581	2408285	There was a movie that described it as trying to push something the size of a watermelon out of a hole the size of a pea.
2409606	2410466	I think it was a lemon.
2410847	2411427	A lemon, yeah.
2412020	2412961	That was Chase and Amy.
2414422	2416163	Giving birth sucks and I'm never going to do it.
2416183	2419546	That's why they cut open your stomach and pull the damn kid out.
2419626	2421227	It's just like, what the hell's the point?
2421287	2425711	It's like trying to shove a piano through a door when there's a perfectly good window right there.
2429634	2432396	I mean, I don't see the point.
2434617	2436479	And that's why men will never have babies.
2436839	2439281	The genius of Loki on Orange Lounge Radio.
2440942	2441463	You know what?
2443101	2444042	Thank you for watching!
2457421	2460983	Yeah, because she has something wrong with her pituitary gland or something like that.
2461063	2465806	It's causing her cells, and I quote, went crazy.
2466886	2472029	And so they're like, that affects how much your blood's produced and like other crap like that.
2472529	2475031	So they have to operate or possibly treat in medication.
2475871	2476111	Ouch.
2478252	2478733	Sure it is.
2479833	2480674	How is that funny?
2480894	2481334	I don't know.
2482995	2484936	It's not life-threatening, so it's not bad.
2486255	2490918	I would imagine having someone operate on your brain itself is life-threatening.
2492358	2493659	Would you like... Oh, hi!
2493699	2495980	We're going to open your head and poke with your brain.
2496060	2496741	It doesn't hurt.
2496761	2497501	It kind of tickles.
2498542	2499562	And you've had brain surgery.
2499602	2500343	That would explain it.
2500903	2502104	That would explain a few things.
2502844	2503124	No.
2505285	2510748	Yeah, so not much going on other than my birthday this week, but, you know... Happy birthday!
2511008	2512209	Yeah, it hasn't occurred yet.
2512705	2514406	9-11 is when my birthday is.
2514986	2520087	I'm thinking in advance because I might be over here.
2520167	2530790	I went ahead and we kind of had a little party for me on Saturday because my mom is going to be out of town for both my birthday and my sister's birthday.
2530810	2534772	It kind of lumped us all together and did all that kind of thing.
2534812	2535952	Happy collective birthday.
2536610	2538952	Yes, and so that was kind of cool.
2539192	2541374	And then I don't know what's going on this week.
2541394	2544036	I'm supposed to go out to dinner with my girlfriend on Thursday.
2544917	2546719	And yeah, that's about it.
2550061	2550462	My turn.
2551548	2554989	My week was kind of shitty because I was, like Jamie, I was sick.
2555089	2559551	I didn't have quite the multiple layers of infection that she had in the end.
2559571	2560811	Oh yeah, I had a sinus infection too.
2561352	2563052	And they tested me for strep throat, but I don't have it.
2563352	2566953	I was just feeling like shit, and it wasn't to the point where I'm like, I gotta go to a doctor.
2567274	2572335	Because I just went to the doctor a couple weeks ago for something else, and after that whole experience I didn't want to go back for a while.
2572876	2573456	So, um...
2574817	2576578	I just kind of slept it off.
2576658	2581302	Like, literally, I went to work, I would come home, nap, wake up for an hour, and go to bed.
2581923	2583884	Like, that was my week, pretty much.
2583945	2584465	It sucked.
2585126	2587227	And then I had this huge thing on my arm.
2587267	2595835	Like, I don't know if it's a zit or what, but I saw one of my exes on Thursday who I hadn't seen in quite a while.
2596796	2599918	And, of course, he's got one of those sarcastic kinds of humor.
2600519	2601580	And no, it is not AIDS.
2603530	2604951	He said it looks like I do drugs.
2605831	2606631	It totally does.
2606771	2609292	So now I'm kind of like, oh, cool, I can go around and show people at work.
2609472	2611073	Like, people at work probably think I do drugs.
2611093	2611653	That's pretty cool.
2613894	2616995	But then I show my mother, and she's like, you've got a burn!
2617075	2622357	It's an infected blood vessel, and you're going to die if you don't go to the doctor and get it taken care of.
2623318	2624378	Have you tried Lansing yet?
2625279	2626859	Well, I can't, but it's going down.
2626939	2628900	So why make a big deal out of it if it's going down?
2628920	2630280	Well, make sure that you take Benadryl.
2631121	2631521	Benadryl.
2632375	2633956	Take it before bed in case I'll knock your ass out.
2635677	2637458	That's what I've been living on is Benadryl at night.
2637858	2639339	That's my anti-drug.
2639519	2643361	My mother also told me something very scary yesterday that made me kind of want to hit her.
2643542	2643782	What?
2644202	2648424	She said, I'm so in love with Cher that I think I'm a lesbian.
2648785	2649565	And then she laughed.
2653127	2655108	And I was like, don't you ever say that again.
2655128	2656189	That's alarming.
2656609	2657790	That is very alarming.
2662588	2666870	I can't really, you know, I wouldn't say it's too much lesbianism there, because she is quite man-ish.
2668071	2668731	Cher, that is.
2668911	2671132	She sounds like a, she sings like a horse.
2671152	2673974	That was pretty much my response, but anyway.
2675494	2676595	She does sound like a horse.
2677655	2681597	Well, actually, for those of you who wonder, Cher was actually doing a concert in Sacramento last night.
2681677	2682778	It was her farewell tour.
2683158	2685759	Second time she's been here, by the way, on the farewell tour.
2688031	2691495	We went the first time, so we didn't see the need to go the second time.
2691515	2695120	I know why she's doing a farewell tour, because she's running out of things to do plastic surgery on.
2695601	2696001	Seriously.
2696181	2698124	But the second time...
2699479	2702362	I love Cher, I love her so much I watch the concert every time it comes on NBC
2726341	2727122	I did not do that.
2727242	2728303	I know.
2729724	2733568	So I decided to go out last night because I'm feeling better.
2733648	2734869	So I went out with my buddy Matt.
2734889	2737712	I was supposed to go to some barbecue with Irene and Brad, but they never called me, so...
2739565	2740746	I went out with Matt instead.
2741267	2745110	Well, we went to the Streets of London, which is a little pub downtown.
2746351	2754878	And we went to this place and I ate this huge plate of... Streets of London has the best fish and chips.
2756019	2756800	Well, I didn't have that.
2756820	2759883	I had a big plate of fries covered in cheese and bacon.
2760363	2761084	Mmm, fat.
2761124	2761844	Yes, chips.
2761925	2762305	Sorry.
2762365	2763766	Chips, cheese, and bacon.
2763846	2764527	My bad.
2766366	2767367	Stupid British slang.
2769490	2771292	I'm just trying to see if I can get Ferb pissed off at me.
2771693	2784247	Anyway... So we went there, and I actually drank beer, but it was Guinness, so I'm forgiven.
2784267	2785609	If it was Guinness, it's beautiful.
2787197	2812126	and this is the drink of the gods after that we went over to the depot because it was kind of late we didn't really want to go like dancing dancing so we went over to the depot which is a gay bar in Sacramento me and my friend Matt the ice princess been on the show before we went over there and then we met like a whole bunch of other people there we met two people he knew from online and we met Phoenix also Corey you may or may not have met him I don't know if you have before or not
2812826	2816229	and then our other friend Joshy who's leaving town.
2816289	2817089	We just had a good old time.
2817149	2818170	We were partying it up.
2818190	2819170	And this is the funny thing.
2820171	2822292	It was the Cher concert after party.
2824614	2828156	So they started playing just like non-stop Cher stuff and we're like, okay, we have to go.
2828476	2830578	And we went to this new burger joint they opened up next door.
2830598	2831919	It's a brand new burger joint.
2832219	2834580	It's a gay burger joint in the gay district of Sacramento.
2835261	2836361	It's called Hot Rods.
2841169	2843209	I didn't get to play pinball at the depot last night, though.
2843229	2843830	That made me sad.
2843850	2845350	There was actually people on them, like, all night.
2845370	2846310	But they have pinball at the depot.
2846330	2848311	Was there good food, though, at the Hot Rods?
2848891	2852291	At Hot Rods, actually, the fries are damn good.
2853012	2854892	It's a lot like In-N-Out, the place.
2855092	2855912	Do they have wine beef?
2856132	2856732	But they have more.
2856972	2858733	They have garden burgers, if you want them.
2858813	2860153	They have turkey burgers, if you want them.
2860513	2864114	They have the hot dogs, if you're into that.
2864174	2865574	Chicken strips, whatever.
2865614	2866735	They have, like, way bigger menu.
2866755	2868235	Some people like hot dogs.
2870386	2871927	Some people like Polish dogs.
2875029	2876971	Okay.
2876991	2880694	That was... I'm not Chinese, so I don't eat dog.
2882055	2884557	What'd you say, Loki?
2884617	2889982	I said... Yeah, well, I'm not... Wait, no, I don't know if it's Chinese that eats... I can't remember.
2890542	2891163	Hello?
2894045	2895566	See, I can't reach the ferret.
2896067	2896687	Come in!
2897368	2897468	Oh!
2899665	2900925	Sharks Girl's here.
2901906	2902866	Not by choice.
2904646	2905427	Speak to our people.
2905467	2907027	Well, Sharks Girl, why don't you tell us.
2907067	2909048	We're all sitting around doing how was your week, how was your day.
2909068	2911108	Why don't you tell us how was your week and how was your day.
2912208	2914349	Week sucked.
2914849	2917750	Yesterday was good, today was good until about what, 6 p.m.?
2918350	2920751	Then it has sucked balls from there on out.
2920911	2923932	And I want to say for the record, Folsom sucks and has no cell phone reception.
2924872	2926172	I get cell phone reception in my house.
2927333	2928333	I've dropped like...
2929164	2931425	Four times since I got off the 50.
2931666	2931866	Ouch.
2932586	2932906	Sorry.
2934347	2934647	Okay.
2935708	2939570	Well, we're going to take a quick break and get back on track.
2939590	2941652	We have a lot of Imani news we want to talk about here.
2942372	2943233	Is there a track?
2943513	2944073	Yeah, there's a track.
2944093	2944934	We have a laugh track.
2945114	2945954	Not at Disneyland.
2948956	2949316	Okay.
2949416	2950437	Rob's going to hell.
2954019	2957281	We're going to kick off this break with a brand new Loki remix.
2957341	2958802	Loki, would you like to tell us about your mix?
2959386	2960286	I gotta change the name on it.
2960866	2961947	Oh, he's gotta change the name on it.
2961987	2964867	But while you're changing the name, tell us something about the mix.
2967768	2970269	Um, it's cool and stuff.
2970669	2971249	No, I don't know.
2971369	2977511	It was just, um, I needed something to mix together and this just kind of worked for some reason.
2977811	2978651	So, yeah.
2982043	2986485	It's, um, Stoic, the Big Thunder Mountain Mix.
2987766	2990127	Alright, this is Loki's brand newest remix.
2990147	2992088	This is Stoic, the Big Thunder Mountain Mix.
2992108	2993149	The brandest new?
2993249	2994229	The brandest newest.
2994989	2996990	Not just brandest new, the brandest newest.
2998911	3001973	Here it is, Stoic, the Big Thunder Mountain Mix, here on Orange Lounge Radio.
3137884	3138664	Hey, I like that.
3138684	3139465	That was pretty cool.
3139525	3141745	That was Stoic, the Big Thunder Mountain mix.
3141765	3142946	That was kind of neat.
3143626	3145567	I have to agree with the chat room.
3145607	3147047	It kind of sounded a little bit like porn.
3147968	3149828	But it definitely choo-chooed along there.
3151609	3152029	I like that.
3152089	3153570	For once, he didn't use gravity.
3153670	3155911	Let's give him a hand for staying away from gravity.
3159032	3160632	Now you've got to do one that's not tack.
3160833	3161793	I don't know if you can do it.
3163942	3166303	But I like the little bits-a-holic there at the end, too.
3166323	3166983	That was kind of cool.
3167704	3168164	That was nice.
3168624	3169024	I like that.
3169064	3170305	Good job.
3170405	3171585	Anybody want to say something about it?
3174406	3174506	Oh.
3175567	3180609	Okay, I think we'll go back to break, because we've got other people doing other errands or whatever.
3182309	3187251	We're going to play some more songs, and we'll be back.
3219518	3220559	Thank you for watching!
3400105	3401110	Thanks for watching!
3486824	3488185	Listen to Orange Lounge Radio.
3488205	3489105	Because Bongo demands it.
3508154	3510676	Hello and welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio.
3511156	3516441	And Tomorrow Perfume we heard in that break, which is kind of part of the Bomani news we've been hearing about this week.
3516461	3517802	Is that a remedy to today's stink?
3519543	3526409	Or as our resident comedian, Lanky Style, says in the chat room, Have you heard the new DJ Taka song sampled for 2DX 10th Style?
3526709	3528351	It's called Yesterday Cologne.
3530652	3532554	I like today's stink.
3533355	3537158	That sounds like something I would have read on Moondabor's blog.
3540157	3543220	I like today's musk.
3564167	3565869	I guess something to do with the demo disc.
3565929	3569113	You hack the disc and you see a master list of songs.
3569173	3575802	And in that list of songs, we saw Tomorrow Perfume, which indicates Tomorrow Perfume will be an unlock in Max 2 USA.
3576863	3577124	Or not.
3577925	3578205	Or not.
3578746	3578986	Or not.
3580189	3597003	It may be, because what happens is, and as this was explained by this guy on the boards called DancerX, he explained that with every new home release, there's an updated master list of every single song that's ever been in DDR, pretty much.
3598124	3601406	Or, so to say, everything that's pretty much in that...
3602527	3605108	version of the DDR engine or whatever.
3605188	3621811	So in this case, we're going to have, with this list, it's pretty much both what's going to be in Dancing Stage Fever and what's going to be in Max 2 USA, because they both use the same engine, so it's hard to determine what's going to be in what.
3622691	3629413	But that was one of the songs that was mentioned in there, along with More Deep from, I think, isn't that 2DX6 style or something like that?
3630945	3632086	Yeah, that's going to be in there.
3633446	3637348	But those are some of the ones that are supposed to be in there.
3637408	3646892	There's another one, one of the ones that kind of grabbed people's attention was, and it's a really odd name, it's called Max and then there's a period after it.
3647712	3651654	So I guess either it's just like Max or Max period.
3653695	3656376	Was Max Unlimited also in the list?
3657563	3658724	Legend of Max, Paranoia, Survivor Max
3689602	3696888	Now, because of this hacking of the disc, they've kind of had to go and reveal some things, some more things about DDR Max 2 USA.
3697328	3702392	And I've always kind of hated this, I know something you don't know business about Max 2.
3702472	3710438	I mean, I understand the desire to create like, I don't know what you'd call it, like people wanted to drool.
3710498	3711239	Superiority?
3711299	3717043	Surprise, not superiority, just wanting to surprise people or whatever, wanting to tease things and stuff like that.
3717083	3717404	But you know,
3718527	3721108	The Guessing Games and all that garbage.
3722188	3724349	Sometimes it kind of makes me wish they'd stay out of it.
3724369	3724969	You know what I mean?
3725090	3726310	I don't know.
3726370	3733473	I just don't like the whole fact that there's this whole I-know-something-you-don't-know attitude about a lot of this stuff.
3733513	3734913	And it just makes me bitter.
3736674	3738675	Anyway, here's what we do know.
3738755	3739555	Here's what we've been told.
3740322	3754112	When they hacked the disc, they tried to bring up the song samples, because if you remember when the Max 1 disc was hacked, they were able to get song samples, and that's how they found that there was a Drop the Bomb remix on there, is that somebody hacked out the sound sample from the demo disc.
3754858	3758779	Well, they got smarter this time, and none of those samples are in there.
3759079	3766681	It just had the four samples of the songs, but it had a Midnight Blaze remix in there, which has been revealed to be the information screen music.
3766921	3767701	Whoop-a-doo!
3768881	3774482	And, for those who don't know, it's probably the same damn remix that was on the V-Rare CD with Max, too.
3775342	3776903	Ooh, don't care.
3777443	3778243	Whoop-a-doo!
3781964	3782044	Um...
3784133	3784633	Feelings Won't Fade
3808751	3816616	Max 2 US has a color-coded song system, meaning that kind of like how Max 2 Japan, you had all these different colors of songs in there.
3816996	3823180	You had, you know, the new songs were one color, the old songs were another color, the Oni remixes were another color.
3823200	3824921	They're going to do that as well with this.
3825581	3829523	And so default songs are green that are new to the US, 27 of them.
3831494	3859830	repeats US songs because there was a few of those in there I believe like Shining Polaris is coming back and there's a few others I think Silent Hills one repeats are blue there's 13 repeats unlocks are yellow and there's 20 unlocks pretty good amount challenge step unlocks are purple and there's 7 of them and the special red unlocks there's 2 of them which assumably have been maxed unlimited in Conklin yeah pretty much um
3861678	3869463	I don't believe that there's not the samples on the disc because they're lazy and stupid and they're going to leave crap like that.
3869483	3872225	They fuck up every single US mix ever made.
3872785	3877528	Every single one's been fucked up in some way and lazy in some way.
3877648	3882251	So I'm going to look myself on this disc to see if I can fight it.
3882311	3886714	Just because they might not have found it the conventional way doesn't mean it's not still there.
3889079	3892000	Burning Heat's been confirmed as an unlock.
3894240	3895060	What else did they confirm?
3895140	3897561	Oh, yes, that Oni Mode is not in the game.
3898561	3899822	Oni Mode will not be in the game.
3899982	3900962	Nonstop, yes.
3901522	3902562	Oni Mode, no.
3903082	3903923	I prefer Nonstop.
3903983	3910264	And in its place, in Oni Mode's place, will be Challenge Mode.
3910444	3913365	Like the challenge on 4th Mix type stuff?
3913765	3914365	That's cool.
3915333	3916874	That's what I heard is going to be the difference.
3916894	3919597	They're going to have a challenge mode to unlock these things.
3920197	3924921	And I like that better, to be honest, because I think Onis are retarded.
3925622	3928104	But that's what they're going to be doing, I guess.
3928724	3931907	Here's why Onis are retarded, and I'm glad they're staying in the arcade.
3932247	3935830	Because playing on a homepad, you miss all the fucking time.
3935870	3937211	It's just part of playing at home.
3937271	3939193	I don't care if you have Ignition 59.0 or whatever...
3940974	3941776	Thank you.
3941816	3942658	So non-stop was a better choice.
3953553	3957935	But it's just weird that they have, now that explains it, Loki, because I had a question.
3958315	3963237	How is it that they have the challenge step songs as unlocks when there's no Oni mode?
3963777	3965938	Or challenge mode, or whatever they're calling it in the U.S.
3966198	3971081	That makes sense to me, because I'm kind of like, wait a minute, so you're not going to have Oni mode, but you're going to have these Oni unlock songs.
3971321	3978844	And you're going to have, unless they go back and make basic trick-o-maniac steps, which I doubt they will, they're only going to have one set of steps.
3981676	3985779	Hopefully, I'll be pleasantly surprised if somebody's gone back and made basic and trick steps.
3985999	3990962	Because I think we all have accepted that the challenge steps will just be the maniac steps.
3991242	3992322	They can do it in five minutes.
3992543	3993183	Loki can do it.
3993243	3994904	Loki will come make steps for you.
3996525	3999227	Well, no, what's sad is they have steps for a few songs.
3999267	4003669	Like, for instance, Hysteria 2001 and Before You Before is a beat mix.
4003890	4004950	They're both in Euromix, too.
4005010	4007812	They have their own basic and trick steps for it.
4008416	4012839	They're just too lazy to put those over into the US mixes.
4013900	4014340	It's sad.
4015181	4015641	We think.
4016142	4016782	We speculate.
4017022	4017543	To this point.
4018123	4019544	We won't know for sure until September 24th.
4019644	4020845	I'm still not making a comment.
4023607	4030392	Um... I'm still going on record saying I'm supporting whatever Konami's gonna do.
4031753	4032614	Officially supporting.
4033234	4033915	I'll have the game.
4035893	4039375	I don't think there's any doubt that we're going to buy the game.
4039655	4043556	It'll be the best mix to date, home release to date.
4043616	4044777	There's no doubt about that.
4045337	4048598	So we all know that Max USA blew everything else out of the water.
4048638	4050199	It blew Max Japan out of the water.
4050339	4050839	I'm sorry.
4050899	4052480	I don't care what you think about the Japanese.
4052800	4055481	It was superior in every way to Max Japan.
4056341	4059222	And Max 2 USA will probably be superior in every way to Max Japan.
4059682	4064404	But as rabid fans, we're going to bitch about everything that wasn't done the way we wanted it to.
4067654	4075416	So, that being said, I believe that covers everything that's been confirmed this week for Max 2 USA.
4075776	4077036	Do we know any more of those songs?
4077076	4079577	I was trying to find that list of songs that were found in the hacks.
4079997	4084218	I know one that kind of struck me as interesting was Don't Call Me Baby by Madison Avenue.
4084498	4086898	Because I haven't seen that announced for either game yet.
4087018	4088719	So it's an unlock in one of the games.
4089259	4090959	More than likely probably the European one.
4090979	4093640	Because I don't think they have as much of the European list to do this one.
4097797	4102142	So, some of the other ones I think were in there.
4102162	4104304	I'm trying to look up the list here.
4104664	4107087	I think Turn the Beat Around was another one, maybe.
4107988	4109710	Or Saturday Night Fever or something like that.
4109790	4115616	There was one that was an old school song that I just can't remember which one it was.
4115896	4116817	There's a bunch of stuff on there.
4116837	4117297	There's another...
4119497	4121438	Another Spice Girls song in there, I think.
4121919	4122439	Oh, goody.
4123099	4130404	But, you know, that's obviously going to be friggin' European, so... Yay, don't care.
4133386	4135487	Anyway, that's the big Monty News this week.
4137369	4137609	So...
4138784	4141725	I haven't really heard of anything else going on in the Bomani world this week.
4141785	4145127	Anybody know anything interesting going on otherwise?
4145667	4146828	Not that I've noticed.
4147448	4147668	What?
4148208	4149549	I haven't really noticed anything.
4149689	4152550	I think that the only activity is going on over here.
4154759	4156260	What, with Max 2 USA?
4156400	4158342	Yeah, I think that's really the only thing going on.
4158362	4163106	Well, we have Extreme in Japan coming out in October, but I think we all kind of know what to expect.
4163246	4168171	Because the Japanese ones, we always know what to expect because they're going to be just like the arcade ones, pretty much.
4168451	4171614	It's just the song list is always a question, and what's going to be an unlock, and...
4172446	4174506	Hopefully Extreme Japan doesn't suck.
4175086	4181968	There's a lot of people already kind of pushing it and selling it as it's going to be the best home release yet.
4182008	4183808	It's going to be even better than Max 2 USA.
4184208	4187449	Personally, I doubt it's going to be better than Max 2 USA.
4187469	4189949	Extreme just sucked for me.
4190169	4191149	Even the arcade version.
4191169	4196870	I mean, sure it had an assload of songs, but not that many new, new, new, new songs.
4196950	4199331	Just a bunch of recycled shit from other games.
4199491	4201791	I actually say that Extreme got me back into playing DDR.
4203757	4205419	I think Extreme scared me away from DDR.
4207140	4208661	I'm just, I'm not a big fan of Extreme.
4208701	4219531	I think I'm, honestly, when it all said and done, I think I'm just really bitter at the fact that the Dance Mania tracks were, there was like, what, seven of them licensed and they weren't that great.
4219571	4221693	There was maybe two good ones out of the whole bunch.
4222213	4224596	And just... I like it for playing all the old stuff.
4225176	4226858	Yeah, I don't know, it's just...
4227486	4227966	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4246303	4271948	I play Stoic, that's kind of fun to dance to, it has interesting steps that are challenging Now what's weird is I actually have been getting back into DDR more lately I've been playing a little more DDR lately, but it's been any machine I can find really, it's not just extreme I played 4th Plus yesterday, I had a ball, until I almost killed myself Playing too many hard songs, that's what I get for being out of shape by the way
4273030	4277034	I play a bunch of Catastrophics back to back and I almost have an asthma attack in the middle of the arcade.
4278976	4281358	But I'll just have to practice more often.
4282900	4284581	Here's some of the songs that were on there.
4286183	4287304	Some of the new ones on the list.
4287364	4292049	Come On Eileen, Groove Is In The Heart, Stayin' Alive, that was the one.
4292734	4295178	I was thinking of staying alive, get down tonight.
4296880	4298262	Then they have, of course, Take Me Away.
4298282	4299684	That's one of the ones.
4300305	4306794	A Stupid Barber, Teenage Kicks, Scorching Moon, A Little Bit of Ecstasy, All That She Wants.
4306814	4307795	That's the end of the baseball.
4308055	4324540	Yeah, Ace of Base, of course, Heaven, Cool for Cats, Jump Around, One Step Beyond, The Boys Are Back in Town, 2020 Vision, Dizzy, Virtuality, Music, the Bowstick Remix, which is by Darude, and then, of course, Busy Child and Feelings Won't Fade.
4324580	4325821	Those are the new licensed songs.
4326061	4332583	Bad Routine was another one that was in there, and More Deep version .21 or whatever.
4332703	4335824	I want someone to do a Routine to Bad Routine.
4335844	4335984	Oh, yeah.
4337390	4339171	and Keep On Lifting from last time.
4339191	4340472	Remember how I said Keep On Lifting?
4340492	4341112	Yeah, yeah.
4341372	4342553	No Nemesis makes me sad.
4343753	4344594	Yeah, no Nemesis.
4344614	4345294	What happened there?
4346255	4348636	Nemesis would be kind of... It's not a dance song.
4348676	4349136	I'm sorry.
4349596	4351257	Whoever cut that, it was a good idea.
4351437	4352678	I hope they put something else in its place.
4356260	4357240	Max, period.
4360342	4360702	Who knows?
4362423	4364544	I think it's just something to screw with people.
4366107	4367308	I think it's just something to screw with people.
4367328	4368149	Maybe it's just a placeholder.
4368869	4371912	I think it's a... I don't think it means shit.
4372592	4374153	Maybe it's something for challenge mode, who knows.
4375895	4377196	But that would be cool if it wasn't.
4377456	4377936	Yes.
4378797	4379558	Yes, it would be.
4384645	4392632	Yeah, so 4th Plus Rules, and that's why I'm so excited that Konga Feelin' and Dream A Dream are going to be in with their respective music videos.
4392952	4393913	That is so cool.
4394173	4395034	That is so cool.
4395374	4396495	I'm so excited about that.
4397095	4401399	That's one thing that they're doing right, so right, that the Japanese mixes haven't been doing yet.
4402500	4404782	But I'll tell you what, this new British mix is coming out.
4404802	4405382	What's it called?
4405422	4405963	The Dancing...
4406781	4410726	Dancing Stage Fever, that sounds like the best DDR game yet.
4410806	4414751	It's got like nothing but licensed songs from all these decades of music.
4414991	4416393	It's got the fucking Spice Girls.
4416654	4417675	That's rad.
4418676	4422721	But the weirdest thing about it is that it's for the PS2 and PS1.
4424432	4429837	That's just, I find that very strange, that they made a version for each system.
4430918	4434040	So, do you think they'll run off different engines or something, or what do you think will happen?
4434441	4437183	I bet you this, well, the CD one won't have the videos, obviously.
4437483	4438784	It'll probably be a fifth mix.
4439745	4440085	Pretty much.
4440145	4446671	I think it's going to be a fifth mix engine, and then you're going to have the other one that's just, I don't know, probably just Max 2, obviously.
4447211	4447592	But, um...
4448372	4454597	Because it's a PS1 version, I can import that because I have a modded, you know, PlayStation stuff.
4455678	4456218	That'd be cool.
4457880	4458600	You're special.
4461262	4461602	Okay.
4464405	4466086	Why don't you tell us about what's going on in the sim?
4466186	4467327	Oh, well, no, let's take a break.
4468308	4468908	Let's take a break.
4468928	4471130	We're going to come back, and you want to do cage match next?
4471470	4472191	Cage match works.
4473171	4473892	Cage match works.
4473912	4475213	We're going to do the cage match when we come back.
4475553	4477835	If you want to participate in the... Yes, Loki.
4479191	4482513	Don't Call Me Baby wasn't on the Dancing Stage Fever mix.
4482833	4486475	No, actually, Madison Avenue, I can't remember if they're a European group or not.
4487736	4488116	I don't know.
4489557	4492319	That song was huge here in clubs, and it still is.
4492339	4494300	They play it every week at the club I go to.
4494380	4496481	I mean, it's still a huge dance song here.
4498531	4503533	I guess the question would be, somebody's got to determine where they're really licensing these songs from.
4503573	4506294	And you could probably figure it out with the record companies involved and everything.
4506354	4511416	Like, what, Euromix 2 had stuff licensed from Zamba, right?
4512416	4517878	But it was never really said where the licenses from the last Max USA was coming from.
4519139	4524160	SyFam, but Sandstorm's not a SyFam song, so there's somebody else involved too.
4524580	4524981	So who knows?
4525541	4525801	Who knows?
4528362	4531344	Please put my song in DDR!
4531964	4533645	I need exposure!
4534225	4534725	Maybe that.
4535406	4540788	Maybe, in the case of Steve Reiner, but hey, Dark Black Forest, I know a lot of people think it's played out.
4540809	4541789	It's the most annoying song ever.
4541809	4543510	Whatever, I totally disagree.
4543530	4547072	I think it was the best licensed song they had in Max USA, and I think it's awesome.
4547092	4548092	I did like Sandstorm better.
4548112	4552395	If I had to admit, their cover for Dancing Sage Fever is pretty gay.
4554276	4555076	It's really retarded.
4557540	4558922	I want to set that girl on fire.
4560123	4561044	Anyway, we'll be back.
4561765	4565069	And I think I played this song last week, but I don't care because the song rules.
4565590	4570295	And Jamie wanted to hear more DDR songs tonight, so I'm going to play a DDR song I want to hear.
4570556	4572618	And it's going to be a Max 2 USA, and that is good.
4572958	4573039	Okay.
4573059	4573239	Okay.
4610530	4611911	Thank you for watching!
4665124	4676012	Clever, Clever Motemashite no Frustration You got an easy day, you got an easy day Sou no Rikou ni Shizuka ni Nemute no Masu ni

4725959	4726900	Thank you for watching!
4869091	4874955	Please listen to Orange Lounge Radio, because real radio makes Captain Jack cry.
4880519	4883662	Hello everybody and welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio episode .59.
4887686	4888327	Uh, we're back.
4888567	4889007	Ha ha.
4889388	4893290	Ha ha, after some discussion on Max 2 USA and how was your week, how was your day?
4893711	4896633	Shark Skrull's been gone for what, about 30 minutes now, I'd say?
4897013	4897654	Not that long.
4897674	4898274	Not that long?
4899115	4901857	Where in the world is Melody?
4902998	4904039	At my house, probably.
4904599	4905940	I'm not funny at all today.
4905960	4906500	You are anti-funny.
4906560	4907461	I understand that.
4907981	4909543	And our anti-funny is Rob.
4910083	4910704	Ha ha ha.
4911704	4912125	Ha ha ha.
4915214	4916555	My anti-fun is Rob.
4916636	4919138	Anyway, Loki, how about a sim update, sir?
4922161	4923562	Oh, you want me to do stuff, okay.
4926084	4934552	But anyways, let's see, Stepmania came out with Beta 4, Alpha 4, I don't know what the fuck they're on now.
4936127	4939568	I think it's like Alpha 4 Beta something.
4940348	4941729	What are we on?
4941929	4943109	Oh, let's see.
4943549	4947130	We're on Step Mania 3.9 Alpha 4B.
4947930	4948771	Whatever the hell that means.
4949311	4952212	But anyways, yeah, so they have more stuff fixed.
4952252	4954012	Getting close to Step Mania 4, yippee.
4954632	4956853	And then, what else?
4957313	4960054	Oh yeah, DWI, I'm sure they did something.
4960174	4960614	Let's see.
4962007	4964428	Uh, DWI is just down this stupid 2.5.
4965109	4965569	They suck.
4966469	4972532	And, um, other than that, not real much going on other than, you know, tons of sim files coming out.
4972953	4977775	Um, Shuey released another part of the DDR sim file history collection.
4978355	4980817	More files from sites you've never heard of.
4981157	4984999	And, um, other than that, like I said, not too much.
4985879	4985999	Um...
4987700	4990684	Pretty much if you're looking for sim files, there are a couple places you can go.
4990784	4998072	Go to DDR Maniacs and check out, in their community news section, there's something about the sim file DC hub.
4998352	5000014	That's the direct connect hub.
5000054	5000615	You'll find...
5001348	5005952	A bunch of people in there with thousands of files they can go leech off of.
5006012	5011636	Also, there's going to be, you know, Bumai style, which you can find a bunch of cool stuff there.
5012317	5020764	And then you can also get off your ass and go do some searches on the internet and find your damn files yourself, you lazy bastard.
5022896	5044820	So, ha, I have to laugh about, oh yeah, there's some thing going on with DDR Freak about getting official sim file collections because, you know, no one has them anymore except for me and, you know, they can go fuck themselves because, not DDR Freak, but the project, the project that just happens to be on DDR Freak because, you know, I'm not sharing.
5046656	5047957	So, what have we established?
5048237	5049337	A, you're a pirate.
5049737	5051598	R, and B, you're a selfish pirate.
5052098	5052819	R, walk me plank.
5053299	5055179	You butthead, you need to be kicked.
5056200	5056420	Why?
5056440	5058341	Someone never spanked you when you were little.
5060001	5066064	No, but I think you know who's taking care of that now that Loki's in his 20s and all.
5067344	5068485	I don't get spanked from her.
5069765	5072006	Not from her, but, you know, your girlfriend.
5072026	5074127	I don't get spanked from her.
5074667	5074947	Never?
5074967	5075067	Never.
5075888	5076208	Never.
5077079	5077639	You guys are boring.
5077659	5078800	I see Dan all the time.
5079120	5082222	Hello, TMI, TMI alert, thank you.
5082302	5086204	No, I mean like literally like kick his butt a few times.
5087164	5089025	Uh-huh, uh-huh, nice recovery, yeah.
5089125	5090526	Oh, he's into the rough stuff.
5091787	5094508	You know, men need women to keep them in line.
5098770	5101672	If not for us, you guys would just fuck this planet up.
5103126	5103606	Sure.
5104607	5112370	You know, because all those crazy women drivers out there causing accidents, tying up our freaking highways and byways.
5113411	5113631	Yeah.
5117633	5118613	Just give me an evil look.
5119294	5122195	You are so dead when I'm over my sick.
5124599	5125059	You know what?
5125319	5125920	You can't hurt me.
5125940	5127861	I have the power of plane crashing.
5127921	5131062	You're going to catch multiple infection disease from her if you're not careful.
5132003	5132503	You know what?
5132623	5133364	I'm immune.
5133424	5135004	Oh my god, Jamie has to SARS.
5135284	5136265	I do not have SARS.
5136365	5137065	It's monkeypox.
5137826	5138486	I'm immune.
5138786	5139327	Oh my god.
5139587	5141047	I heard that SARS was coming back.
5141087	5142208	Like, it was a big thing on Yahoo.
5142448	5146550	Hey, you know, it's like, it's like, it's like Leif Garrett, okay?
5146590	5148511	All of a sudden, SARS making a comeback, right?
5149132	5151173	And what if you have SARS, Jamie?
5151193	5152553	I don't have SARS.
5152914	5153494	How do you know?
5154582	5155983	I've never been to China!
5156483	5159024	Have you been in contact with any Canadians lately?
5160845	5162286	Namely in the Toronto area?
5163187	5165068	Is Marin Chan the Secret League Canadian?
5166268	5168730	Oh my god, my spinners are coming from Toronto.
5168930	5170270	They're probably laced with SARS.
5170290	5172392	Oh my god, they're SARS-infested spinners.
5172932	5173872	You can shut up.
5176794	5180476	Okay, before we get killed, I think now's a good time to get into the Orange Lounge Radio.
5181346	5182006	Cage Match.
5182307	5183948	I'm ready for the fuck you's of the week.
5186529	5188830	Fuck you's of the week right after the Cage Match, I promise.
5190191	5198096	Last week in the Orange Challenge Radio Cage Match, Loki won when he brought to the table his pick from Cybertrans Presents ELT.
5198536	5201337	And Cybertrans, by the way, they're the folks that put together the...
5203343	5207244	Ayumi Trance, thank you, Ayumi Hamasaki Trance, which 23rd Magus swears you can buy at Dimple.
5207524	5209785	I'm going to get killed.
5211246	5215347	Anyway, the song, the particular song from that CD is called Face the Change.
5216747	5221669	It's remixed by Dirt Devils and Above and Beyond.
5222518	5223840	And above and beyond, very cool.
5223900	5225583	They do a lot of great remixes.
5225844	5233636	They did Madonna's What It Feels Like For A Girl video remix, and they also did M, Ayumi Hamasaki's M, which is a great sim file.
5233837	5234558	I like this song.
5235891	5264044	Alright, here it is, last week's winner, and this first song you can vote for in the Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match Oh, and if you want to vote, get to our chatroom, www.callybomani.com Click on Orange Lounge and click on Chat And then you can vote in tonight's Cage Match, it's just that simple The winning song goes into rotation all week long on Orange Lounge Radio Here's song number one, this is Every Little Thing, Cybertrance With Face the Change, Dirt Devils and Above and Beyond Remix And you only hear a clip of it because it won last week, here it is

5291867	5293248	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma
5317818	5318919	Thank you for watching!
5346049	5347035	I don't see that
5382955	5383976	Oops, dead air, sorry.
5384536	5386137	Dead air.
5386197	5386618	My bad.
5388239	5390100	You want to take the next song, Jamie, or you want me to?
5390880	5391401	Why not?
5391801	5392361	You're going to do it?
5392542	5393102	Yeah, why not?
5393482	5394263	Are you okay?
5394283	5395063	I'm having a nap.
5395223	5396244	You sound sleepy.
5396264	5397365	I'm taking a nap.
5397845	5401168	Okay, well, before you nap, tell us about your song pick for this week.
5401308	5403529	It's a remix of Tori Amos' Sugar.
5404190	5405891	I'm so proud of Jamie.
5405911	5407212	She picked Tori Amos this week.
5408072	5410414	It's a good song, and it sounds all dark and depressed.
5411420	5415662	So, this is a dark and depressing trance remix of Tori Amos with Sugar.
5415702	5417463	This is song number two you can vote for tonight.
5418444	5419404	DarkSakura's pick.
5419444	5420465	Here it is, the whole song.
5432951	5437954	DarkSakura's Pick
5440541	5446924	Don't say my name is gone, don't say that to me Like a day when I thought you were gone, I had to let you go
5562644	5563427	Thank you for watching!
5618542	5619103	I wish you love
5669461	5670481	Thank you for watching!
5697836	5700857	Okay, that was Tori Amos with Sugar, the trance remix.
5701277	5705157	And this is where we go around the room and everybody tells what they think about it and rate it.
5705177	5705957	Tori, you do no wrong.
5706758	5709138	And it's trancy, and it fit my mood today, so a ten.
5709518	5710118	A ten from Jamie.
5710158	5710738	Is the mic on?
5712459	5712839	Yes.
5713039	5716259	Sorry, I couldn't hear you through the monitors for some reason.
5716339	5717499	Okay, I hear it now.
5717800	5718140	Okay.
5718260	5719180	I don't know, that was weird.
5719200	5720940	Sorry, I'm having a SARS moment.
5721820	5725281	So a ten from Jamie, no surprise.
5726081	5726281	Loki.
5728456	5729076	It was alright.
5729277	5730477	It was mellow.
5731838	5732198	I give it a 7.
5736080	5736400	I agree.
5736440	5737341	Troy can do no wrong.
5739562	5741243	It sounds like a fan remix to me.
5741803	5742183	I don't know.
5742203	5746306	It sounds a little... Unpolished?
5746366	5747066	Yeah, unpolished.
5747086	5747746	That's what I'm looking for.
5747766	5748027	Thank you.
5748047	5750708	A little grainy was the thing I was going to look for.
5750748	5752289	But it's pretty damn well done.
5753009	5756331	I can't see myself giving it a 10 for some reason, but a 9.
5756391	5757092	9.5 even.
5759291	5760092	I do really like that.
5760213	5760833	That was very good.
5761114	5762115	And Tori is the shit.
5763537	5767341	I would be a horrible gay man if I were to give Tori a low score.
5768142	5768523	Anyway.
5769506	5770687	I hope that the mix fits the song.
5771068	5771508	It does.
5771588	5772629	It does really fit the song.
5773029	5774451	Have you heard the original of that song?
5774951	5775952	Not in a very long time.
5776412	5778675	Yeah, the remix fits it very well.
5778755	5780856	So whoever remixed that did a damn good job.
5781617	5782798	I would not be sad if that won at all.
5783018	5784820	I actually like all of tonight's cage match songs.
5785200	5786942	Usually there's one I'm kind of like, eh, I hope it doesn't win.
5787342	5788423	Tonight, I don't care what wins.
5788443	5788864	They're all good.
5790288	5791970	So, my pick, song number three.
5792030	5793812	Now, I knew that Loki won last week.
5793832	5794733	He had a trance song.
5794853	5796635	I knew Jamie was bringing a trance mix.
5797075	5804763	So, usually, when, you know, I know of trance, that there's going to be two trance songs, and I try to do something different, like crazy.
5805103	5807186	Like, I'll do something really, like, stupid crazy.
5808267	5811150	And usually that ends up being a Kylie Minogue song of some sort.
5812665	5815105	But tonight I thought, you know what, I don't really want to play Kylie Minogue.
5815225	5817486	Yeah, how dare you put Kylie against, you know, Tori.
5818166	5819626	Tori would up and kick her ass.
5819766	5822387	No, so I thought, I'm not going to put in Kylie Minogue.
5822467	5825447	Instead, I'm going to put in her sister, Dani Minogue.
5826367	5826687	What?
5826707	5830448	Because Dani Minogue is starting a singing career, so I'm going to put in a song by her.
5831448	5836269	This is Dani Minogue with Put the Needle on It, the Jason Nevins Ultra Pop Radio Edit.
5836289	5840110	And I heard this last night at the club and I liked it a lot, so it's my entry for tonight's cage match.
5840450	5841110	Here it is, enjoy.
5866962	5867963	Thank you for watching!
5912221	5912982	Thanks for watching!
6005206	6006289	Thank you for watching!
6045189	6045750	Thank you for watching!
6077970	6083118	Alrightio, song number three, Danny Minow, Put the Needle on It, Jason Evans mix.
6083299	6083559	Jamie?
6083860	6085763	I guess what's good for Kylie is good for Danny.
6086444	6087445	Break out the cookie cutter.
6088767	6089909	It wasn't bad, so you get the six.
6090626	6091606	Okay, Loki.
6093967	6094947	I like to give it an 8.
6097087	6100608	You actually told me to play... I played like four of them for you and you said that was the best one.
6100648	6101028	I agree.
6101328	6101828	I like that one.
6101968	6103208	In my opinion, that's the best one.
6103248	6104228	The remix is awesome.
6104608	6105649	It's porno.
6105929	6110810	It makes me want to do lap dances in Pixie Dust's lap and tug on her Kylie underwear.
6112850	6113890	I'm going to get killed for that.
6116030	6116811	I like that song a lot.
6116831	6117111	I give it a 9.
6117151	6117191	So...
6119306	6119726	There you go.
6119766	6121588	Those are your three picks for tonight.
6121808	6122468	So here they are.
6122508	6123329	Here's a quick clip.

6131995	6132135	Hi.
6132175	6132556	How you doing?

6145134	6149995	First off, last week's winner, Every Little Thing, Cybertrans, Face the Change.
6157476	6162017	Alright, song number 2 you can vote for tonight, Tori Amos with Sugar, the Trance remix.
6172974	6176637	or song number three, Danny Minow with Put the Needle On It, the Jason Evans mix.

6186964	6187905	Place votes now.
6189146	6189646	You know what?
6190547	6191607	I think it's time to rant.
6192548	6192928	All right.
6193308	6198252	Not like the FUs of the week because our chat room has to respond to that, too, and they can't do that while they're voting.
6198712	6199793	What now, Jamie?
6200393	6201134	Just kidding.
6202645	6203105	I love you.
6203666	6203966	Hi.
6204266	6204506	Hi.
6206468	6212292	I'm ranting about retarded people.
6212632	6217896	I just noticed you can see my construction table on the webcam.
6217956	6218716	That's pretty cool.
6220037	6220478	Let her rant.
6222248	6224489	Just about... Don't rant about retarded people.
6224529	6225290	They can't help it.
6225830	6228551	I'm talking about people who aren't retarded but act retarded.
6228871	6229292	Oh, okay.
6230032	6230412	Okay.
6231453	6237556	Just people who have, like... People need to go to school before they're allowed on the internet.
6238096	6243238	And I mean go to school and actually pass, like, grammar and spelling before they're allowed on the internet.
6243478	6244379	People need... I think...
6245043	6250089	You know, I was reading on my mailing list for J-List how there's like a test for everything in Japan.
6250730	6255255	You know, like your fluency levels, there's a test to play baseball good enough.
6255835	6256817	There's tests for everything.
6257037	6258679	They need to have tests for everything here.
6259780	6263544	Where, like, you have to have a certain level of proficiency before you're allowed to breathe.
6264726	6264786	Or...
6266358	6267198	Maybe not that extreme.
6267578	6278141	But like, you know, you have your internet level proficiency, so when you log into the internet, you have this number that you can go on the web with and be allowed to type.
6278882	6293946	Or, you know, have your degree of, you know, like with driving too, you need to keep testing, but you know, when you reach a certain age, you need to take like the I'm still okay to drive test, or
6295575	6301080	And in some cases, especially with driving, when you get to a certain age, you need to take it every year.
6301540	6301740	Yes.
6302921	6307385	When you get to 65, you have to... In fact, when you're like 85, you need a monthly exam.
6307865	6311908	And they need to make sure that you can see over the fucking dashboard.
6312629	6312869	Thank you.
6312889	6317853	You're also... You also need to... what?
6318154	6320956	Especially if you're a little Asian woman in the Bay Area with SUV.
6321136	6321396	SUV.
6325331	6326273	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
6337541	6341323	with, uh, you need to, like, take the parental responsibility test.
6341523	6345085	You think it wouldn't be that, you wouldn't need that much intelligence to be a parent?
6345485	6347466	I mean, all you gotta do is put it in the right hole.
6347506	6348727	I mean, that's pretty much it.
6348747	6351889	No, that's, that's, that in and of itself is just breeding.
6352349	6357712	People can fucking, fucking, fucking fuck all they want to and, you know, sprout babies like bunnies.
6357992	6360153	I think it's all the stuff that they're taking while they're breeding.
6360934	6365896	But I think that, you know, there's, there's not many responsible parents around these days, you know?
6366377	6366797	Don't you agree?
6366817	6366897	Yeah.
6368357	6374561	And, you know, the people that I know personally, I'd say they're fairly responsible.
6374781	6379323	Me, I know I'm not responsible enough right now to be a parent, so I'm not going to go out and do something.
6379443	6381465	I'm not even responsible enough to own a pet.
6382445	6383205	I have a Shermie.
6384466	6388228	But Shermie poops in a box, and I only have to clean up after her once a day.
6390269	6390550	Okay?
6391050	6393011	I don't have to change a diaper 20 million times a day.
6395392	6395612	Right?
6395913	6396113	Yeah.
6396353	6396573	Oh, yeah.
6398180	6412866	I think, it's just, I was, I was, when I was out and about earlier in the week, I was just noticing, you know, little children running off to do whatever and their parents were sitting there on their cell phones.
6413684	6414685	DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com
6441577	6458772	That's why, and I was thinking of this when I was listening to, you know, I was very, very, you know, I guess proud when I was listening to Vandalist talk about, you know, how much time and care they take into, you know, he takes with his family.
6459233	6461154	I just wish that there were more people like that, you know.
6461194	6465238	They should limit families to have only one child, just like they do in China.
6465598	6468019	No, I think that people... And you're being a fascist.
6468419	6471140	You know, you can't literally step in there.
6471160	6472681	This is America, land of the free.
6472721	6474282	I mean, as great of an idea as it sounds.
6474582	6478443	And there should be certain people that are limited to one child or zero child.
6478523	6479344	It's not possible.
6479364	6489248	Child services don't step in, you know, for neglect until the child's already dead, left in their car for five hours, you know, burned to death or asphyxiated or whatever.
6489968	6490328	You know, I...
6492089	6499437	I just really think that it's very sad and I needed to take a moment to get that out of my system because, you know, this was on the news just, what, last week?
6500278	6503902	Or like, you know, with Disneyland with the gum on the rail, you know?
6504643	6506805	Stupid child, parent wasn't watching, you know?
6508547	6512431	There was probably a little kid looking for a quarter on the track and that's how the train derailed.
6513749	6517030	It's, you know, people need to take responsibility.
6517150	6524032	Now, since I brought up Disneyland again, all the cool rides have gone away because of stupid people.
6524332	6526352	I mean, look at, like, the People Mover.
6526372	6529753	The People Mover, while slow, was a good way... He did not get rid of the People Mover.
6530133	6530793	Yes, he did.
6530953	6531314	Oh, my God.
6531394	6532714	They got rid of the People Mover.
6532734	6532994	They got it...
6535362	6537062	Disneyland did not get rid of the PeopleMover, did they?
6537242	6538903	Yeah, like, you can go to hell.
6539243	6540523	I hope all their rides derail.
6540563	6543224	The PeopleMover was the coolest thing on the entire planet.
6543404	6544764	And if they got rid of it, oh!
6545444	6546505	You know why they got rid of it?
6546525	6550225	Because some dumb fuck thought it'd be a cool idea to rock the thing and it fell over.
6550245	6551286	Well, then kill him!
6551526	6552086	Just kill him!
6552446	6554466	Give me a gun, I'll shoot the fucker myself.
6554486	6555827	Well, actually, he did die.
6555867	6558227	Don't tell me they got rid of Mr. Toad's Wild Ride.
6558247	6559167	No, they didn't get rid of that.
6559187	6559988	I'm driving to Anaheim right now.
6560008	6561268	But then they replaced the PeopleMover...
6562186	6566307	They replaced the, um, what was it, the people movers?
6566467	6570869	No, it's not gone, but it's not working.
6570889	6572309	Submarine's gone.
6573169	6575810	Are they going to get rid of the teacups because someone got sick?
6576130	6578611	Look, you stupid bitch, you can see how the ride works.
6578631	6581612	You're going to spin around and around and around and around about a...
6582276	6583817	That was in goddamn time.
6584257	6586879	If you don't think you can't handle it without puking, then fuck off.
6595638	6598079	They're basically these things that go really fast.
6598499	6603721	Like, they just have the acceleration rate on them is just ungodly, like, huge.
6604241	6610983	But that's the problem was is, I don't know, someone did something in that one, like stood up or something, and they died too on that.
6611663	6614744	So that's why those guys... Maybe someone should die on It's a Small World.
6615224	6617445	They will never ever have to have it again.
6618165	6619185	Oh, God, I wish.
6619826	6621106	It's a Small World is so lame.
6621146	6623787	Yeah, that's the other thing is that it takes someone dying...
6624560	6626641	And then they get rid of things that other people have in front of them.
6626682	6628463	They better not get rid of Thunder Mountain Railroad.
6628483	6629423	That ride rocked.
6629543	6629864	Okay.
6630224	6638349	No, they're probably going to turn it into, you know, like, I don't know, Daffy Duck's, you know, piano adventure.
6638369	6638690	I don't know.
6638750	6640051	I'm thinking of Roger Rabbit.
6640331	6642592	Piano adventure, so there's a piano on a track.
6642833	6643993	It's a runaway piano.
6646474	6648496	People do not know what the People Mover is in our chat room.
6648516	6652099	That's fine, because we have people from all parts of the world that listen to Orange Entree.
6652119	6653941	The People Mover is a ride at Disneyland.
6654001	6656823	It's in Tomorrow World, because Disneyland is broken up into all these little areas.
6656843	6664070	You have the New Orleans section, and the jungle section, and you have Tomorrowland, which is all the futuristic stuff.
6664090	6665231	That's where the Star Wars ride is.
6665971	6669174	We all know, yeah, 50 years ago anyway, it was the Tomorrow stuff.
6669494	6675058	But, you know, that's where Captain Neo was, that's where Space Mountain is.
6675158	6687508	Anyway, so, PeopleMover was this little ride, and you sat on it, and you just, it was like a little trolley, and you went all around Tomorrow World, and it gave you a little lecture about all the little things that were going on, but the end of it,
6688243	6689503	It was narrated by Tim Curry.
6689523	6692504	And if they got rid of the people mover, Disneyland could go fuck itself.
6708513	6711655	There wasn't too big of a line for me to go on the PeopleMover the one time I've been.
6712335	6713456	See, that was the funny thing.
6713816	6715237	It wasn't every time.
6715557	6720020	No one used to go on the PeopleMover because it was like, ooh, PeopleMover is Space Mountain.
6720060	6721261	We'll go on Space Mountain.
6721541	6723742	PeopleMover is just like, I'm tired of walking.
6723762	6725463	I just want to sit down for a little bit.
6725763	6726084	It was great.
6726104	6727545	You know they've been doing Space Mountain now.
6729366	6731387	Space Mountain is closed for renovations.
6732347	6733388	Yeah, because it sucks.
6733428	6734029	It's old.
6734169	6735950	I've only been on it once, so it was fun for me.
6736170	6738031	They had techno music in there.
6739417	6740057	That'd rock.
6740478	6743540	Well, anyway, back to... What was I ranting about?
6743600	6744220	Stupid people?
6744701	6745041	Kids.
6745061	6745982	Kids, yeah, kids.
6746822	6749564	They need a ride that's just like F-Zero.
6750205	6755028	I think that kids will grow up better if they had the same exposure to stuff that we had.
6755088	6755969	They need tetherball.
6757327	6763591	Children eat tether balls so that, you know, if you get hit in the head enough times, you know, duck, dodge the ball.
6764272	6770016	Parents have to understand that there's a certain percentage of kids that will get raped and molested by people.
6770396	6774059	Just accept the fact and hope that your kids aren't part of the statistic.
6774339	6776280	You can't protect them from everything.
6776681	6778942	You have to prepare them as best as you can.
6779042	6780123	Take responsibility.
6780383	6782065	Molestation builds character.
6782125	6782565	No, it doesn't.
6784326	6784967	No, it doesn't.
6785167	6786288	Don't talk about that.
6788510	6791752	But, you know, they take away everything.
6791772	6795333	You know, all the stuff that we had when we were kids, you know, that stuff was cool.
6795393	6801756	We had, you know, I fell off of the freaking, you know, monkey bars before, busted my lip open.
6801776	6802777	I have a scar right here, see.
6804346	6806927	and I'm perfectly well adjusted.
6807187	6808048	Oh, I cried.
6808528	6809188	Ow, you know.
6809888	6812209	I was stupid and I never fell off of the monkey bars again.
6813330	6816871	What's up with these pansy playground equipment that they have now?
6816911	6817692	It's all like powder.
6817852	6818272	Plastic.
6818732	6819433	Plastic.
6819753	6821013	Whatever happened to the really cool wood stuff?
6821033	6823994	You're going to get rid of sand boxes next because children are going to eat sand.
6824815	6825795	I ate my pies.
6826195	6826576	Look at me.
6826636	6827076	I'm normal.
6827596	6828857	Well, relatively.
6829837	6831998	I grew up mostly adjusted.
6833729	6835630	You know, forget this.
6836210	6838351	When I was back in Alabama, I went by my elementary school.
6839551	6850096	And I swear, all the metal things that I used to climb on, only a couple of them were there and they were rusted over so that nobody would want to touch them because they looked nasty.
6850996	6852317	It's not fun anymore.
6852857	6854238	Not fun to be a kid these days.
6854578	6859800	Especially with the Teletubbies teaching you that it's okay to go up to a perfect stranger and give them a hug.
6861084	6862025	Yeah, yeah, yeah!
6862465	6863366	I'm going to hug you.
6863426	6864667	Oop, watch me be a kid now.
6864687	6865568	You're so retarded.
6865748	6868791	You missed the whole thing we just did, so we're going to do it again.
6869191	6871534	You know, the world is not bright sunshine.
6871594	6873015	Repetition is fun.
6873035	6877579	You know, when I was little... You know, okay, you know what I was raised with when I was five?
6877599	6879541	I freaking had...
6880299	6881720	Well, what did I watch when I was a kid?
6882380	6888622	I watched the Smurfs, and the Smurfs taught you that there's fire and it burns down the trees, and the wolf's not a happy singing place.
6888682	6890543	And the Smurfs promote homosexuality.
6890603	6891023	Yes, they do.
6892043	6896145	Except when they got, you know, Smurfette, but I think that, you know... Smurfette.
6896245	6898125	It was like a colony of ants.
6898706	6899986	They all fucked the queen.
6900866	6903107	And then when I was... How old was I?
6903127	6903107	1983?
6903147	6903407	84?
6903167	6903407	I was about...
6909553	6916135	7, the best show ever came on TV, Transformers, at Transformers at G.I.
6916155	6916475	Joe.
6917436	6923518	I mean, there's a different Transformers than the one with these little Transformers that they protect, and it's like Pokemon.
6923538	6924298	Okay, forget it.
6924538	6926619	You know, I don't watch that Armada crap.
6927639	6929680	Or what about the ones where they turned into dinosaurs?
6929740	6931521	I love that one, and apes and stuff.
6931541	6932741	Hey, don't forget about Xenobots.
6934522	6935122	Yeah, whatever.
6935742	6936843	Okay.
6937043	6944446	But, you know, I had, what, Jason the Wheel Warriors, we had Voltron, we had... Now, what is there to watch on TV now?
6945686	6948527	Pokemon, Digimon... Digimon's cool, don't mock Digimon.
6949147	6950948	But Pokemon's retarded, okay?
6952108	6952728	Yu-Gi-Oh!
6952868	6954849	And Digimon people die, okay?
6955149	6956930	Why are we teaching kids to play cards?
6957742	6959364	Isn't that like, can I take it?
6959705	6961427	That's the way it is.
6961467	6964731	You're going to get a paper cut and get infected and die.
6966486	6967466	And then cards will be banned.
6967887	6969548	It was the same thing when we were kids.
6969628	6972430	Every cartoon had its elaborate marking scheme that went with it.
6972490	6976573	Like, everybody wanted the He-Man that you would punch it and the little thing would spin around and make it look like it was damaged.
6976593	6977995	They don't have battle damage toys anymore, do they?
6978055	6978615	I know!
6978955	6979876	That's so stupid.
6979896	6983359	You know, we had really cool things when we were young.
6983379	6983979	I'll tell you what.
6984279	6985701	I cry for today's children.
6985721	6987562	You know what toy I played with more than anything, though?
6987942	6989283	More than anything, what toy I played with?
6989464	6989804	Legos.
6991065	6992726	I had Lincoln Logs and they were made out of wood.
6992906	6994968	And I got splinters in my fingers when I tried to break them.
6996010	6996371	DarkSakura.com
7009497	7011738	I built catapults with my Lincoln Logs.
7012098	7014979	You put, like, one of those small ones on a nice, you know, roof piece.
7014999	7015719	These rubber bands.
7015939	7026683	And you can hit it just really hard and it goes... I would build parts of my houses with rubber bands so that I could make them collapsible so they would kill my little weeblemen that I put inside of them.
7027244	7028244	Comment from the chat room.
7028284	7029925	This is how you know it's all coming to an end.
7031885	7032386	Guess what?
7032426	7035107	Rice Princess says she saw Transformers on MTV.
7036227	7036867	Can I cry?
7037808	7038728	You may have a sniff now.
7039713	7044216	Unless it was the old ones, but if it was the new crappy ones, then I'm going to try.
7044236	7045858	Yes, Naoki2DX's winner, Tinker Toys.
7045898	7046778	Tinker Toys are the shit.
7046838	7048559	I had Tinker Toys too.
7048579	7049160	Construx.
7049460	7049940	Construx.
7049981	7051742	I had a whole fucking tub of Construx.
7052751	7054652	I had the Tinker Toys that were life-size.
7054832	7056792	They were the size of me, okay?
7057152	7058133	They kicked ass.
7058673	7060854	You could build giant things that hurt people.
7060954	7064955	And they didn't have... They had, like, the building pieces were like PVC pipes.
7064975	7068556	So, you know, you could fight with the pieces and you could, like, injure people.
7068936	7069677	It was awesome.
7069957	7071837	And Constructs, I had tons of those things.
7071957	7072998	Oh, my God, just tons.
7073018	7073458	We had...
7074358	7080422	We had these things that were like plastic, hard plastic sticks with foam on them.
7080982	7082503	And you could beat each other up with foam.
7082723	7085965	But if you took the foam off, they were sticks and you could whack people in the head with them.
7087265	7090787	And like, toys were lethal when we were young.
7091088	7092408	Growing up was survival.
7093549	7094970	And look at us, we're strong.
7096067	7097889	Yeah, because we're not dead from our toys.
7098169	7102733	I think Pixie Dust is saying in the chat room that the Smurfs are a reminder of the Anna Nicole show.
7104035	7104475	Okay.
7108339	7110821	Anyway, how about the winner of the cage match?
7111462	7111802	Okay.
7112423	7113964	The winner of tonight's Orange Lounge cage match.
7113984	7114324	Are you closing?
7115065	7115846	Yes, I'm closing.
7116627	7117507	Eat your vegetables.
7119489	7120190	More spinach.
7120470	7121091	You need iron.
7122212	7129714	The winner of tonight's Orange Lounge Cage Match, I'm actually somewhat surprised by this, but the chatroom did vote this one as the winner tonight.
7131414	7136216	It is last week's winner, Every Little Thing, Face the Change.
7138236	7143277	Once again, curse you, Loki, and your cursed trance music.
7144738	7149379	Alright, so I think now's a good break time, huh?
7151452	7154193	What do you say when we come back we let the real ranting begin, eh?
7155194	7155394	Sure.
7155554	7156955	The FUs of the week when we come back.
7157295	7161476	Also, before we get into the FUs of the week, though, I want to talk about my gaming experiences this week.
7161496	7163217	Because I've actually been playing more video games this week.
7163237	7164217	So I want to talk about some games.
7164377	7164958	Gasp!
7165238	7165638	Gasp.
7166178	7167979	So, we'll be back.
7171658	7187307	Dreamer Dreamer, take me in your dream Take me anywhere you please Boy, you're making me scream Dreamer Dreamer, life is just a dream If you wanna set me free Boy, you're making me scream Ooh, la-la-dee, la-la-da You've got a dreamer dreamer
7214712	7215920	We rock the spot, no!
7250165	7251857	You gotta dream of being a dream
7375076	7375960	Thanks for watching!
7455891	7457492	Hi, this is Mel B of RTF.
7457852	7462734	And for an extra $1.99 a minute, my girlfriend Mel B can join us on all the fun together.
7463454	7469557	But hey, if you're a broke ass like I am, why don't you come to one place that costs absolutely nothing to go to and still the fun is just as great.
7469897	7471778	It's Orange Lounge Radio, Sunday nights.
7472338	7476740	Kick it with me and you just might realize the best things in life are free.
7478221	7479301	Hello, we're back.
7481022	7481963	Uh, guess he's back.
7482863	7482943	Oh.
7486144	7487765	Yes, Shark Skrull's back.
7487805	7488105	Hello.
7488645	7489186	Hello.
7489786	7491066	So you're back finally.
7491247	7492427	We were starting to worry a little bit.
7492447	7493728	We were like, well, she's been gone a while.
7493788	7494348	At least I was.
7494588	7494988	I was worried.
7495008	7497130	The freaking lights just take forever.
7497170	7499691	Although I saw the funniest low-riding truck ever.
7500391	7503433	Dude, it looked like its ass was dragging on the ground, and it had spinners.
7504573	7505073	Oh, God.
7505314	7509236	Those are the most annoying things on the planet, those things that spin.
7509596	7511517	I almost pulled out my ditch cam and took a picture of it.
7511577	7513938	It was that bad, but he turned before I could do it.
7517032	7521015	Spinners are horrible, and it's even worse on a low-riding truck that's dragging its ass on the ground.
7523396	7524277	What did we see earlier?
7526138	7526619	I don't remember.
7526679	7527439	Tell them what we saw.
7528039	7529641	We saw the ultimate of crap low-riders.
7529681	7530401	It was so ghetto.
7530921	7533963	It was, like, bad, like, paint job, red and white.
7534764	7536425	And it was just, like, some crappy Chevy.
7537966	7542169	And, no, the fearless sticker was the one in my house that was really crappy, too.
7543027	7547151	You know, if your car looks like crap, make it look good before you put a sticker on it that has fearless on it.
7548893	7553018	I don't... People just fear my car when I'm in it.
7555520	7558083	My little Tercel can do some damage.
7560986	7563449	I took a picture of my dream car, though, one of my dream cars.
7564409	7568331	There was a 350Z in the parking lot in Madeira, so I took a picture of it because I want one.
7568532	7569092	Madeira.
7569792	7570573	Madeira.
7571413	7572434	I had a fun time at the fair.
7572454	7573795	That's a suburb of Fresno.
7574335	7575916	I had a fun time at the fair, though.
7576236	7577397	You went to Fresno.
7578618	7579818	I did not go to Fresno.
7579838	7582180	I went to some place.
7582200	7584401	You went to a place that's worse than Fresno.
7584421	7585302	Madeira District Fair.
7585322	7591325	I still have this stain of blue on my hand, too, from where they stamped my hand.
7591365	7592126	It looks like a bruise.
7594469	7595930	Shall we get into the FUs of the week?
7596430	7596890	Showa!
7602133	7604154	This is the best part of the show.
7604194	7608336	Here is justice.
7608396	7609937	Here is punishment.
7609997	7611438	Here is... This is fucked up.
7612478	7613379	Fuck being sick.
7614900	7619282	Actually, that was real.
7620162	7621523	Good timing, my lungs.
7622484	7623244	Fuck being sick.
7625149	7627409	Fuck trying to enjoy myself while being sick.
7628290	7632010	Because I try and try and try, but being sick sort of overshadows it.
7632511	7638212	And I had a very good time at the concert, so that was great, but I just felt horrible.
7638232	7639932	And I've been sick since Tuesday.
7640512	7649254	And it got bad enough for me to go to the doctor on Thursday, and I don't go to the doctor, so this is the first time I've actually been to a doctor on my own in seven years.
7650274	7651354	Yes, I'm an angry girl.
7651394	7652194	It's on my card.
7652214	7652275	Duh.
7652295	7652775	Um, you know...
7656341	7663246	Fuck stupid people and parents who don't know how to take responsibility for their children.
7664567	7667910	And fuck things that suck.
7669591	7670432	And not having money.
7671733	7673474	Not having money is the big suck of all.
7674495	7677957	I could stand being sick if I had money because then I could go on the internet and shop.
7678878	7679739	I can't even do that.
7680479	7680759	Sick.
7682140	7683701	So, yeah, that's not it.
7683761	7684342	Fuck being sick.
7686043	7688664	Okay, Loki, I know you're cooking, but it's your turn.
7689784	7691625	He's making the bacon crap.
7694546	7696387	Oh, I don't believe that for a minute.
7696427	7697747	Loki says he doesn't have anything.
7699428	7699888	He's cooking.
7700068	7702409	You're going to give up your chance to rant about something?
7702469	7703149	Fuck cooking!
7703989	7704329	Here.
7707390	7712692	Um, yeah, F you to stuff.
7713917	7714818	and stupid people.
7714998	7717499	You actually had a good week and nobody bothered you.
7719601	7720181	That's amazing.
7720241	7720922	Yeah, no.
7721542	7723523	I didn't have a good week and people bothered me.
7723944	7725344	But it's not really anything out of the usual.
7726485	7726845	I see.
7729067	7731068	Yeah, it's because grease and fire don't mix.
7731288	7732349	You're the one that I want.
7732969	7735171	I want, I want to... I'll be back.
7735371	7736832	I'm sure I'll interject something later.
7737953	7738553	Oh, hooray.
7739374	7739914	My turn.
7743286	7745187	My FU this week goes to Walmart.
7745607	7746987	Because Walmart is evil.
7747468	7750189	Walmart is the worst place on the face of the planet.
7750309	7750909	I'll tell you why.
7752190	7752410	Fine.
7752430	7754150	All you're going to find is V8 Splash.
7756411	7757612	I love V8 Splash.
7757632	7759032	Because I don't drink soda anymore.
7759132	7761653	I'll have the occasional diet, but I'm really trying to not do that.
7761733	7762834	I'm really, really trying to not do that.
7763194	7764714	So, V8.
7764774	7766495	I have V8.
7766595	7769136	Splash is mostly what I drink in iced tea and lemonade.
7769856	7770157	Mixed.
7770397	7770837	I like that, too.
7771696	7774798	V8 Splash is good, especially Diet V8 Splash, because it's made with Splenda.
7775538	7776319	It tastes like Propel.
7778320	7780601	Anyway, my entry of the week goes to Walmart, because they suck.
7781141	7785944	I went to Walmart on Saturday night with LankyStyle, because I wanted a new F-Zero game for GameCube.
7786124	7789826	And I was all excited, because the new F-Zero game for GameCube is supposed to kick ass.
7790246	7794829	And I had a $10 off at Walmart card, because my work gives out gift cards as incentives.
7794849	7796990	So when we do something really good, we get a gift card.
7797010	7798571	So I had a $10 gift card to Walmart.
7799833	7804895	Because they ask people at work, what places would you like a gift card to?
7804955	7806135	And people are like, Walmart.
7808576	7811117	So, anyway, I decide I'm going to go to Walmart to get an F-Zero game.
7811658	7812198	I get there.
7813218	7813959	Nobody's there.
7814599	7815959	Nobody's in the electronics department.
7816019	7819861	So I just kind of stand at the desk and wait, because you know how they have the games in the case?
7820141	7822142	You can't just reach in, pull out the game, take it to checkout.
7822162	7825263	You have to get somebody to open the case for you so you can get the game.
7829953	7834596	Heaven forbid you carry around a game as big as the DVDs that you can buy in the rack next door.
7836197	7843721	Anyway, finally this nice lady, she looked over, she was stacking movies and she saw me and she came over and she said, can I help you type thing?
7843741	7845042	And I said, yeah, I wanted to get that game.
7845442	7847123	And she's like, oh, I don't have the key.
7847223	7848483	Let me get somebody who can get the key.
7848524	7850505	I'm like, they don't have the key behind the counter?
7850605	7850985	Fine.
7851885	7852846	Get the manager, get the key.
7853954	7860617	So they get one of those people, after 10 minutes, at least 10 minutes, they get... Oops, sorry, my music ran out here.
7861798	7872302	After at least 10 minutes, finally one of those folks in the red vests, who I guess are like, you know, super Walmart stars, or whatever they are, managers, assistant managers, whatever they are, they're the red vest people.
7873103	7877865	At Walmart you have the blue vest people who are the normal drones, and the red vest people who command the blue drones, right?
7878945	7880206	So a red vest came by...
7881943	7883344	And he had the wrong key.
7883424	7885346	He tried to open it up and he had the wrong key.
7885426	7889789	And the woman who was there was like, no, no, no, you need the blue and green one, not the blue one.
7890369	7892170	Apparently everything's color-coded at Walmart.
7893591	7900216	So he leaves, and ten minutes later, after waiting another ten minutes, he comes back and says, I can't find it.
7902257	7907241	So finally the lady says, I'm so sorry, I know where the key is, I'll go get it.
7907791	7908633	So she goes off.
7908713	7909976	Ten minutes later, she comes back.
7910356	7911559	Sir, I'm so sorry.
7911719	7913102	After a half hour now of waiting.
7913603	7914645	Sir, I'm so sorry.
7915407	7916850	The key isn't where it's supposed to be.
7918607	7919047	What the fuck?
7919067	7920588	Do you mean the key's not where it's supposed to be?
7920829	7921589	Who opened the case?
7921709	7925112	No one opened the case between the time I was there and when she was there.
7925432	7926553	Where was the manager?
7926593	7928834	Where was anybody running the electronics department?
7929214	7930395	Why aren't things where they're supposed to be?
7930615	7931996	Why isn't the key behind the counter?
7932316	7934078	Why doesn't the red vest guy carry the key?
7934138	7937360	Why doesn't he know what the hell color key goes with what?
7937620	7939321	Doesn't he know how to run his own fucking store?
7940062	7940402	Fuck.
7942323	7945265	I was about to say, go to the hardware department and get me a hammer.
7945305	7945946	I'll fix this.
7947139	7947839	Seriously.
7948940	7949300	So.
7951121	7951561	God.
7951941	7952801	So I didn't get my game.
7953262	7953842	I'm pissed.
7954222	7955863	I leave Walmart and I don't get anything.
7957183	7958744	So I went the next day to Target.
7959424	7960645	I purposely went to Target.
7960685	7962245	I could have gone to GameSpot where I usually get games.
7962325	7965247	No, I went to Target because I purposely wanted to buy it for the competition.
7965747	7968868	So I went in and within two minutes there was a guy behind the desk.
7969188	7971369	He opened the case up, got my game, rang it up right there.
7971449	7973090	I was in and out of Target in three minutes.
7979162	7979482	I'm done.
7979983	7980523	Your turn, Melody.
7981925	7983707	Wow, are you sure you want to do this?
7984007	7984227	Yes.
7985789	7991075	Fuck traffic, fuck red lights, fuck the cell phone reception in this damn area because it keeps dropping my hook.
7991376	7995861	And fuck the fucking truck that's parked in Jamie's parking lot because I freaking hit it!
7999047	8000929	And Jamie says she's almost hit it a bunch of times.
8000969	8004894	And the funny thing is, you couldn't fucking tell that I hit the damn car.
8005274	8008598	It's like so beat up and crappy, you can't even tell.
8009539	8010600	Oh, Jamie wants to elaborate.
8011642	8013744	Fuck everybody who parks along that fence.
8014485	8015246	Damn them all to hell.
8016838	8022082	Yeah, it's like, it's parking spots, and then people parallel park right behind you, so it's like a freaking obstacle course.
8022502	8026846	And I had a car trying to come in that was trying to hurry me up, but apparently I just went a little too far.
8026906	8029107	And I couldn't see the truck, because it was right directly behind me.
8029427	8031329	I was looking over my shoulder, but you couldn't tell.
8031369	8032510	And I was like, oh, fuck.
8032930	8037273	So, yeah, fuck that, and fuck having to drive home now, because I was stupid and forgot something.
8037854	8039875	Anyway, I forgot my computer.
8040255	8043898	So, fuck having to drive home, and fuck having to work tomorrow, because I really don't want to.
8050044	8053826	Wow, okay.
8054666	8055587	I'm angry tonight.
8057348	8058488	Shall we hear from our chatroom?
8060549	8061270	Alright, here they go.
8061990	8062770	Chatroom FUs.
8064852	8067373	DarkTetsuya says, F you to missing most of the show.
8067953	8069634	And F you to morons at the theater.
8069654	8073476	If you're gonna make cracks about the movie, that's what watching it at home is for.
8074657	8076218	And F you not having Soul Calibur 2.
8077236	8079478	Wait, I have to add something though there with the movie.
8079558	8080159	Yes, Shark Skrull.
8080459	8082301	Sometimes that's better than the movie itself.
8082501	8083442	I definitely agree.
8083462	8084903	It really depends on the movie you're seeing.
8084983	8090388	Because like, when we went and saw Pokemon, yelling back at the screen made it ten times better.
8091349	8093511	Spice World, Case Point, thank you.
8097589	8098830	I saw Spice World opening day too.
8098850	8099490	High five!
8100930	8102571	I saw Spice World for free.
8102911	8104392	I didn't have to pay for it.
8104452	8107533	We were going to dress as Spice Girls and everything, but we didn't have time.
8108553	8111054	It was us and all these junior high girls.
8111474	8112915	Yeah, we were the only people in the theater.
8112955	8115036	My friend and I were the only people in the theater without a kid.
8115116	8116596	It was kind of scary, actually.
8116796	8117957	I had so much fun at Spice World.
8120445	8121245	Oh, I have the tape.
8121966	8123046	I have a promo poster.
8123146	8124246	I have a promo poster I won.
8125347	8125567	Anyway.
8126227	8127107	Back to the angst, please.
8128568	8130648	But Spicer, I'm fine.
8130828	8131468	23rd Magus.

8144693	8147673	Now I'm not allowed to leave my bedroom after 1 a.m.
8148114	8149334	Okay, you can live in the dorms.
8150146	8151968	What the fuck?
8152148	8156792	F you to the CIS department dean at ARC for dropping me for my PC repair class.
8158193	8158953	Bitch, die.
8162096	8165559	John Fields would like to say F you to Adobe Premiere freezing up a lot.
8167420	8169282	F you to one of my hard disks dying.
8170043	8173966	F you to classes that require outside class activity beyond homework.

8241002	8242043	But this is the new one, right?
8242063	8243603	Not the one that's closer to me, actually.
8243803	8247185	If I wanted to go to the close Ikea, I'd just go to the one in Burlingame.
8247425	8248285	Emeryville.
8248305	8251126	No, the new one's in East Palo Alto, and I work in, like, Palo Alto.
8252326	8254187	I have a friend that's moving to Palo Alto this week.
8254747	8255308	Oh, wow, cool.
8255328	8255728	He's cute.
8255748	8256388	You should be his friend.
8256648	8256948	Anyway.
8256968	8259309	Put him on Friendster.
8261010	8262090	Put him on Friendster.
8263831	8264151	Okay.
8265651	8267592	F you to the idiot who hit my neighbor's car.
8267652	8269793	They hit the end trying to pull into his spot.
8269833	8271193	Yeah, it was Shark's Girl.
8272574	8275455	And my neighbor and myself watched as this happened.
8276855	8281057	The guys just looked right at us, pulled out, and tried to hide further down in the parking lot.
8285393	8288094	John Fields would like to clarify, or give another F you.
8288114	8291456	F you to websites that force you to say yes to their install programs.
8291877	8294438	I'm sick of hitting the power button on my computer because of them.
8295238	8297600	Mozilla is your friend.
8297680	8298820	Just click no.
8299020	8303443	Yeah, stop going to porn and wear sites, because those are the only sites I know of that force you to click yes.
8304183	8304523	No.
8304924	8307825	Well, all you have to do is just use the Google toolbar.
8309746	8310467	Pull out that four.
8312348	8312828	Lastly...
8313641	8317704	Pixie Dust says, well first off, a big F you to myself for getting a new tattoo.
8317744	8319565	It is scabby and hurts me.
8319985	8321686	So yeah, I'm not too comfy right now.
8323327	8323687	I don't know.
8323767	8324568	What is it of?
8324748	8325729	We want to hear it, Pixie Dust.
8326249	8329011	The ugly mofo I went out with for a month in April.
8329031	8331212	F you for ruining my birthday pics with your face.
8331312	8332213	You remember him, Sky?
8332233	8332613	Yes, I do.
8333153	8336215	And another F you goes to people who have been moody and bitchy around me.
8336295	8338497	Get off your poopy ass toilet and get happy.
8342219	8343460	That is the best thing ever.
8343920	8346222	Get off your poopy ass toilet.
8346402	8348203	Come on, get happy.
8348644	8349905	Someone take that quote.
8350425	8353467	Take that quote right now and post it in the Orange Islands Live Journal.
8353667	8354188	Right now.
8355049	8356850	Get off your poopy ass toilet and get happy.
8357150	8358251	Yes, post it now.
8358291	8361473	I nominate DarkTetsuya to run that task because he always posts in the community.
8362174	8363315	DarkTetsuya, get on that, please.
8364716	8367278	Let me cut and paste for your copying pleasure here.
8368378	8368759	Yes.
8368819	8369659	Don't tell me no.
8369679	8369719	No.
8373129	8374710	I think he's telling 23 Magus no.
8374730	8376070	You can tell him no yo you want.
8378031	8378311	Alright.
8378971	8379271	Anyway.
8379691	8380752	On with Pixie Dust FUs.
8381232	8387374	By the way, I found the camera for my birthday dinner and that brings up all the bitchiness towards that asshole and the way he dubbed me.
8387434	8389575	He was... You can do so much better than that, Janae.
8390495	8392256	FU to Sky for not liking Walmart.
8392276	8392996	Screw you too, bitch.
8393576	8397858	It is ghetto, but hell, I got a new Razor with free refills for only five bucks.
8397998	8398318	LOL.
8398698	8401939	I'll get over the Walmart thing, but that made me mad.
8402586	8403326	I'll get over it.
8403406	8404607	I'll shop at Walmart again.
8405167	8407667	But they can eat me.
8408028	8413909	And I won't go to that one by Brad and Irene's house because there's a Target right there and Target's cooler.
8414249	8415710	And they have good smelling soap.
8418711	8421371	Fuck you to Los Rios District for stealing my money.
8424112	8428713	Bunch of greedy bastards that want to take my money and not buying my book back or refunding my $54 fee.
8433044	8433564	Okay, done.
8433584	8434064	Love you all.
8434084	8434504	Mwah.
8438026	8443827	Oh, Loki wants to go now because he thought of something, and now he has bacon in his system, so... Can we get a mic over to Loki?
8444308	8445628	Causing his angst level to rise.
8445648	8445948	That's it.
8445968	8446308	They're done.
8446328	8446928	That was the last one.
8449989	8453871	Have you seen Stupid News Reporters covering the Disneyland tragedy?
8454691	8455011	Or, uh...
8457225	8458948	I mean, that's just stopping you.
8471485	8474386	F you to Gray Davis, because you suck.
8475266	8481547	And just because you think immigrants should now not drive, well, good for you.
8483207	8485008	Hello, hello, hello.
8485308	8486988	News alert, that's an assembly bill.
8487768	8489249	It's not just Gray Davis.
8489289	8491669	This is the only thing that bothers me about the recall.
8492029	8496210	I think they should recall the entire fucking assembly, because Gray Davis gets blamed for all these bills.
8496290	8499871	Sure, he signs them when he can veto them, but he's not the sole...
8500666	8501807	What we do?
8501867	8502748	He signs the bill.
8503228	8503989	I sign a check.
8504009	8504549	What's your point?
8506771	8514117	Anyways, so, um, yeah, FD to Gray Davis, because, you know, you like illegal immigrants in the country because they do dirty work.
8514877	8516979	Um, I think we should kick you out of the country because you suck.
8519941	8521042	Somebody's stealing my bacon.
8521062	8521783	Ass.
8521983	8522063	Ass.
8524935	8526095	My bacon.
8526335	8527416	Mmm, super bacon.
8528456	8529356	Mmm, bacon-y.
8529376	8531537	Boy, this is super bacon.
8532017	8532257	Is it?
8532897	8533817	It's moderate super bacon.
8533837	8534797	Oh, it's moderate bacon.
8537178	8539719	Melody really likes the autographed picture of Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen.
8541419	8545160	That's just a temporary placeholder until I get the porno pictures of them.
8551201	8551441	No.
8553402	8553702	I'm done.
8557816	8558136	All right.
8559917	8561658	FUsOfTheWeekAreDone.com.
8562179	8562539	Hooray.
8564000	8565261	So I have something else on my mind.
8565361	8566881	Oh, Jamie has something to say?
8568062	8569283	I want pancakes right now.
8570664	8571124	Oh, God.
8571724	8573525	I wish there was like an IHOP near here.
8574226	8575967	I want... Yeah, but it's closed.
8576667	8576908	Isn't it?
8577928	8578308	I think so.
8578629	8579769	I want pumpkin pancakes.
8580049	8581030	Besides, you had IHOP yesterday.
8581050	8581710	You don't want it again today.
8581730	8583211	I want pumpkin pancakes.
8583231	8583732	And we have Mongolian.
8584432	8586353	That means, you know, Mongolian means you go poop a lot.
8586373	8587334	The Mongolian is sick again.
8588399	8588799	You know what?
8589299	8593200	I found a way to not have a diarrhea bomb after Mongolian today.
8594201	8594541	What?
8594961	8596161	I didn't put any oil in it.
8597462	8599382	I only put about half the noodles I usually do.
8599402	8600423	I put no oil in it.
8600483	8603164	I put nothing but teriyaki sauce and sweet and sour sauce in it.
8603404	8605524	I'm going to show you something.
8605604	8606665	Do you see this bottle?
8606825	8607085	Yes.
8607485	8608465	I'm going to hold it up.
8609586	8612606	I've got to cover my name because we have our names.
8612967	8614147	Oh, well, don't put it on the webcam.
8614407	8614967	I am, too.
8615047	8615387	All right.
8616668	8616988	Oh, good.
8617008	8617608	My name's not on here.
8619195	8624156	Okay, I'll let you know how long you have to hold it there.
8625576	8627357	Oh, it took a ghost picture.
8627377	8628637	You got 50 seconds before it goes again.
8629677	8631157	Okay, so while we're waiting.
8631637	8632858	Alright, look at that ghosty thing.
8632958	8634318	That's erythromycin.
8634838	8635658	It makes you poop.
8636498	8638639	Never eat Mongolian barbecue when you're on antibiotics.
8639459	8639799	Thank you.
8640259	8640499	Okay.
8641579	8646240	Actually, the one thing that works better than this for going to the bathroom is sugar-free Hershey's dark chocolate.
8646761	8650566	But today's Mongolian, I just want to say today's Mongolian only made me fart a lot.
8650646	8653810	It did not make me go to the bathroom and just unload.
8663283	8664925	Loki, can you say that in a microphone, please?
8668604	8672486	Something that'll make you crap more is 746 All Purpose Cleanser.
8672986	8675527	It's what they use to clean all the countertops and stuff at Roundtable.
8676047	8679829	If they put that on your pizza and you eat it, it'll make you shit out.
8680189	8685411	I mean, someone did that to me once, and I never knew that that much crap could be in my body.
8685992	8689513	I think I shit solid, like, I shit... Solid shit?
8690414	8695676	No, I... I shit for a complete hour, like, just non-stop shitting.
8698597	8699797	It's like going on a diet.
8700097	8700818	It's like that stuff.
8701198	8703838	No, I wonder if that's all that, you know that Hollywood diet?
8704158	8718162	Yeah, the colon cleanser, the Hollywood diet that you can buy at Walgreens and you basically mix it with water and you're supposed to take it on a weekend because you don't want to take this at work because you're going to spend your weekend vacationing on the throne, vacationing on the porcelain throne.
8720094	8723535	Bring a Game Boy and a bathroom reader because it's going to be a long weekend.
8723735	8727576	That's the only place that, like, you know, the British Excel is in toilet technology.
8727596	8731017	Because they have some really kick-ass toilets.
8731037	8733458	Dude, why isn't the bidet huge here?
8733518	8734338	That's what I want to know.
8735539	8736879	Bidets are the shit.
8737179	8738080	No pun intended.
8738140	8739760	I would love to have a bidet.
8739780	8740600	That would kick ass.
8740740	8743661	I would... Japanese super toilet.
8743801	8744522	Oh, yeah.
8744682	8746962	A Japanese super... Man.
8747843	8748503	I want a bidet.
8749318	8751421	Let's talk to our landlord and see if we can get a bidet in here.
8759832	8760072	Yeah.
8761454	8762515	I think now's a good time to take a break.
8764318	8765039	Can we just take a break?
8765805	8766666	We did the FUs of the week.
8766946	8767807	Oh yeah, I must have been caught.
8768107	8769248	It just feels like a break.
8770369	8774111	This break I'm going to play .59 again, but I'm going to play a special remix of it.
8774432	8776713	Because a lot of people have been requesting this in chat rooms.
8776754	8779295	So, this is a really good remix of .59 too.
8779396	8785740	So, to celebrate episode 59, which is what we're in right now, here's .59, the piano version, a Naoki remix.
8786941	8787102	Enjoy!
8787122	8787442	Enjoy!
8981549	8982150	Thanks for watching!
9070649	9074793	Let's listen in on an Orange Lounge Radio staff meeting.

9077255	9080939	Do we care what people think of us?
9081539	9083401	No!
9083421	9084842	Do we want people to kiss our ass?
9085303	9087945	Yes!

9101903	9104584	Any final thoughts from you since you're leaving?
9108345	9109066	Tip your waiter.
9110526	9110966	Very nice.
9111467	9113307	Have a safe drive.
9113407	9114168	Thank you for coming.
9115468	9117329	Tell everyone in the bay we said hello.
9118249	9119330	I'm stealing another piece of bacon.
9120310	9122491	That's another F you to rob for stealing Loki's bacon.

9158693	9160094	Sharks Girl has left the building.
9161175	9163736	Bye, Sharks Girl.
9163796	9164997	Good all.
9165017	9166418	We're good enough.
9166598	9167699	Tell Mel we said hi, too.
9168119	9168860	Too bad he couldn't be here.
9169420	9170741	He was stuck working.
9171576	9171776	So, um...
9200899	9202160	I was at Virgin Megastore this week.
9204842	9205863	No, I'm not a virgin.
9206243	9207184	Sharks girl, weren't you leaving?
9207204	9207644	No, I'm kidding.
9208325	9208665	I love you.
9210819	9213921	I went to a Virgin Megastore this week and I was doing some shopping and I picked this up.
9213961	9214602	This is pretty cool.
9214702	9217343	I picked up the single for Drifting Away.
9217984	9220045	Lang featuring Sky with Drifting Away, the single.
9220105	9221005	Here, I'll put this up on cam.
9221086	9223547	Oh, I can't put it up on cam for another 50 seconds when it refreshes.
9224287	9228290	It's an interesting little background picture, just a little sunset.
9228770	9229711	It has four tracks.
9229731	9232072	It has the radio edit, which you're probably all familiar with.
9232092	9233193	The original 12-inch mix.
9234011	9238985	A Beam vs. Cyrus remix with Sucks Balls and the Lang Sunset Dove, which is okay.
9239446	9242654	But I thought it was kind of neat to walk into the store and it was like, ooh, a Bomani single!
9245180	9247501	Because I didn't think this song had actually been released in the U.S.
9248121	9249621	So that was kind of a pleasant surprise.
9250201	9250401	What?
9250421	9251722	Are you sure that's not an import?
9252242	9252902	I don't think so.
9252922	9255123	It didn't have the little import sticker on it.
9255243	9259904	And you know what's cool is it's put out by Radical Records, who did that Time After Time CD, if I remember right.
9260224	9260444	Yes?
9261364	9261844	I'm not sure.
9261924	9264305	Anyway, I'll put this up on the cam so you guys can see what the CD looks like.
9265245	9269506	So I picked up... I don't believe this is an import, but... Who knows?
9271107	9271207	Um...
9275166	9276147	I think I got it blurry.
9276207	9277107	Oh well, forget it.
9278027	9278888	I can't hold my hand still.
9278908	9279368	You have to deal.
9279888	9280649	Yeah, deal with it.
9282650	9284570	So that's on the cam if you want to see what that looks like.
9285331	9285431	It's 9.02.
9285811	9287092	Wow.
9287652	9289173	I know we're cruising through the show here.
9289233	9290513	Is there anything you wanted to bring up?
9291514	9291754	No.
9292894	9294235	Yeah, I guess we do Ask Orange Lounge.
9294315	9295075	You can see it clearly.
9295355	9296756	Yeah, you can see it clearly enough on the cam.
9298457	9301238	If you want to Ask Orange Lounge a question... Actually, I want to bring up something.
9302038	9302659	Okay, well...
9303823	9306404	I have a new forum for people who are into gaming of all kinds
9330712	9333974	It's at roleplay.darksakura.com.
9334634	9335075	Sign up.
9335775	9339778	I run, basically, there's going to be freeform games run there.
9339798	9347444	If you want to run a game using the message board system, send me a private message, and I'll get your game set up, get you set up as moderator.
9348364	9349665	for your forum, for your group.
9350125	9350785	We'll get you set up.
9351245	9355467	Also, we have different game discussions, different types of games.
9355527	9359088	So if there's a game that you want to have an open discussion on, let me know.
9359108	9360788	Just sign up for your account and we'll set you up.
9362589	9363289	It's that easy.
9367811	9372232	Also, since you brought up Tuesday's show, let's give a plug for all our spinoff shows.
9372312	9373773	I didn't say what time my show is.
9374750	9378632	Okay, well, Tuesday, well, I'll start with, I should start with Monday, yes?
9379292	9380233	Yeah, you just want to go first.
9380613	9381133	Yeah, I know.
9381653	9395340	Monday nights is Vanilla Sky, and, um, it originally was going to have a rotating panel, I was going to have different people in here every week, but, um, Brad and Irene have worked out so well that they're just here, pretty much the perma-co-hosts on Vanilla Sky, where we talk about, um,
9397336	9401779	We talk about everything, kind of like, we talk about other game stuff, and then we talk about things outside of that.
9401799	9406983	We talk about what's going on in the real world, also, outside of your computer, from a nerdy point of view, definitely.
9407443	9411947	And we do such crazy antics as, I guess, the Yahoo Talkback, because people on Yahoo are stupid.
9412407	9415489	And we do, of course, bad music and video game trivia.
9417170	9419152	Have you listened to bad music and video game trivia yet, Jamie?
9420083	9421324	Um, no.
9421484	9422045	It's exciting.
9422305	9424367	What I do is I give video game trivia.
9424407	9427049	I question Brad and Irene on a certain topic.
9427089	9428430	Like last week it was racing games.
9428450	9429371	It was a topic.
9429391	9430451	I quizzed them on racing games.
9430872	9435475	And for every question they get wrong, we bring up the volume of some bad music.
9435536	9437197	Like last week was Barbra Streisand music.
9438498	9439619	Barbra Streisand's cool.
9440119	9445624	Well, you know, everybody, no matter what I pick, somebody always goes, but I like that person.
9445644	9447745	The first week it was Enya, then it was Celine Dion.
9448466	9449327	Celine Dion, yeah.
9450370	9453111	So Leon has only done one good song and it was Meatloaf.
9454731	9456592	And we talk a lot about Puzzle Pirates too.
9456652	9458693	It's kind of turning into a Puzzle Pirates show almost.
9458713	9460293	You don't play Ragnarok with me anymore.
9460553	9462314	It's because I didn't renew my account.
9462374	9464834	I'm waiting for that other thing.
9465035	9466615	Well, renew for another month and play with me.
9466695	9469116	I'm waiting for the Dyslexic Rollo fan club to open up.
9471136	9471496	That's all.
9472097	9473017	Renew your account and play with me.
9473607	9474228	I'll think about it.
9474968	9476049	But I like Puzzle Pirates a lot.
9476389	9479151	So, that's it.
9479191	9480772	That's what you can look for on my show.
9482254	9483354	My show is Tuesday.
9483575	9485896	It's basically, it's all requests.
9486096	9489919	It's called Pump Up the Volume because I'm a big 80s nerd fan.
9492441	9499106	So, it starts at 7.30, although I have a 7 o'clock pre-show because I usually just have that on while I go to the bathroom.
9500067	9501228	Oh, did I say that on the air?
9501428	9501788	My bad.
9503493	9508675	But no, it starts at 7.30 unless you want to catch the pre-show beforehand.
9509135	9512536	I play requests, so I hardly talk so you don't have to listen to my crappy voice.
9513877	9516338	I sometimes talk, you know, discuss things.
9516398	9519279	I'd like to have a guest, but no one ever wants to come hang out with me on Tuesday.
9519539	9521400	I'd come some week, but you have me on this show.
9521760	9522720	You have me on this show.
9523020	9523961	Yeah, I don't need you anymore.
9523981	9531003	You need to get some other... You have other... You need to get Shark Skull or... I don't know.
9531123	9532244	I'll try to arrange a guest.
9532304	9532744	Get Dan.
9533895	9534975	Dan's working Tuesday nights.
9534995	9536355	That's why I do the show Tuesday.
9537816	9545537	But if you're in our chat room, then you can send me a private message that night, and I will play anything that you want, if I have it, or something by the same group.
9546077	9548918	Unless you request, like, Spice Girls.
9549078	9552118	I played Vitamin C. Vitamin C's cool, though.
9552859	9560160	But there's just, like, very few things that are on my I Will Not playlist, and usually that's, like, a couple of songs.
9561630	9562551	I want to hear Dirty.
9563491	9563992	And Dirty.
9564092	9565553	That won't be played on my show.
9565793	9566494	That song sucks.
9567795	9572638	By the way, I just have to say, at the Depot last night, I saw the video of that.
9572919	9576081	They played the video of the MTV Video Music Awards, that whole little thing.
9576361	9576882	The smoochie?
9576922	9577382	Fabulous.
9577422	9579464	And you should have seen all the, you know, because it's a gay bar.
9579724	9581305	You should have seen all the gay guys' reactions to that.
9581325	9581965	It was great.
9582005	9583747	We were just all calling.
9583927	9584407	It was great.
9584427	9584808	It was fun.
9585728	9585988	Anyway.
9586829	9587950	Yeah.
9588010	9588310	Sorry.
9588510	9588851	It's okay.
9588871	9589351	Sorry to interrupt.
9590280	9602449	Um, but, uh, it lasts until, uh, 10.30, and then that's usually the point where I have to wait another 30 minutes for the Ragnarok server to come back on so I can play more Ragnarok, like the addict I am.
9603570	9604971	And, it's, it's fun.
9605572	9610455	I, I figured that's, I figured that's why you did your show Tuesday night, because that was RO maintenance night.
9611076	9616500	This, this Tuesday, though, um, I was going to be doing video game music trivia again, um, and
9617583	9621404	But I won't be able to do it because I'm going to be talking as little as possible.
9622644	9624485	You know, trying to let my lungs recover.
9624505	9632986	Which is different than the video game music trivia I'm doing because she's literally video game music trivia.
9633606	9635987	And I have like multiple question style.
9637607	9644289	So, you know, if you guess what it's from, what level it's from, give me as much as you know about this music, you'll get a point for it.
9645009	9645249	Cool.
9645916	9647498	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
9665678	9667399	Zero didn't make it last week, so I don't know.
9667439	9668079	He's got another week.
9668099	9669100	Thursday show, Bacon Man.
9669280	9671822	Otherwise, we may be looking for something else to put on Wednesdays.
9672542	9676084	Sorry, but if he misses two weeks in a row, I'm just... My show's fun.
9676544	9679066	If he misses two weeks in a row, I'm just going to assume he doesn't want to do it.
9680106	9682187	And Wednesday night, more pummeling on you.
9683268	9684849	We'll think of something creative for Wednesday.
9685249	9687230	I do have a backup show that's ready to go.
9687470	9688611	Not a live show, though.
9689972	9690312	We'll see.
9693587	9699409	Okay, my show, LiveWire, every Thursday, 7 o'clock, hour-long pre-show.
9702610	9707732	Usually, I've been doing now like the show before, you know, kind of replaying the show previous to it.
9709637	9719720	And this week on LiveWire, we're going to be doing kind of like a non-stop of every single LiveWire so far, all five shows, because it's my birthday and I'm not going to be here to do this.
9720421	9724742	So I'm going to have them all remixed together.
9724802	9729644	Basically, I'm just going to redo every set without my voice on it and mix together better.
9729804	9729984	So...
9731384	9734166	You know, have those and you'll get to hear them non-stop.
9734186	9739408	And at the very end, there'll be something special for you listeners who stay tuned.
9740289	9743771	It was going to be a new Loki remix, but I played that tonight.
9744191	9745352	He blew his wad.
9745852	9747032	No, it might be another one.
9747092	9747453	I don't know.
9747513	9749494	We'll see.
9750494	9758739	I would like to see a strung together mix of all... Dark's Baka in the chat room.
9758799	9759359	Hey, Baka.
9760399	9762340	DarkSakura has a show Tuesday night.
9762380	9763721	That's what she was just talking about.
9763801	9764021	Anyway.
9767042	9768443	Thursday nights, live wire, yes.
9769183	9777248	Yeah, so we got a little something special at the end there for those who tune in for the long, long set of music that's going to be there.
9777348	9781470	And also remember, because it's going to start off, I'm starting the show earlier this week, it's going to be at 6.
9783189	9783629	DarkSakura.com
9805938	9811882	Um, Livewire, the motion picture score, you know, like, kind of like a score type music.
9811962	9816345	And then last week's, which was Fuck the R.I.A., which was... That was beautiful.
9816425	9822069	It was independent, um, indie artists versus commercial artists, and it was pretty sweet.
9823450	9823971	Very cool.
9824351	9828634	Um, I, Livewire is such a great show, it's getting me into mixing, even.
9828714	9831896	And I did a mega mix that I played after Vanilla Sky one week, and, uh...
9832917	9840283	If I do it more regularly, I might find some spare time on the station to air him on a Saturday afternoon or something, but who knows.
9843165	9846127	I don't want to take any thunder away from Loki, but he's way better at it than I am.
9846327	9847908	He can do it on the fly better than I can.
9849494	9856138	And I really do, literally on the fly, because the last few weeks I've been really slacking on getting my show together.
9856258	9860281	And I literally, I'm working on the show until like the last three seconds.
9861461	9862202	Literally, so.
9862882	9866745	Alright, so Orange Lounge Radio, live programming every Sunday through Thursday night.
9866985	9869566	Well, Wednesdays are questionable recently, but we'll see.
9869867	9870847	We're going to work on that.
9871267	9874610	Anyway, as promised, you guys can ask us questions now.
9874670	9876691	It's Ask Orange Lounge.
9876751	9878312	So if you want to ask us a question...
9879443	9886088	Head on to our chat room, www.callybomani.com Click on Orange Lounge and click on chat.
9886148	9890032	And you can ask myself, Loki, or Jamie any question you want.
9890532	9896837	It's one of our favorite segments to do on this show, especially when we're desperate for filler material, which is often.
9897598	9900280	Especially in a slow Bomani News Week as it has been lately.
9902802	9904903	What day of the week is Max 2 supposed to come out?
9904963	9906064	It's the 24th, right?
9906144	9906785	That's a Wednesday.
9908689	9913413	We might be doing something, um, we'll have to do something the day that Max 2 comes out, just to add that in there.
9913473	9917497	Anyway, let's talk about Orange Lounge, or ask Orange Lounge.
9924303	9927286	Let's ask Orange Lounge some stupid question.
9928007	9931390	Who will get yelled at this week on Orange Lounge, asks the same man.
9935430	9936171	I like cheese.
9936411	9937031	I like milk.
9937732	9938472	They give me gas.
9938612	9938992	All right.
9939993	9941294	I'm going to do something, by the way.
9941674	9941894	What?
9943135	9944256	That I haven't done in a year.
9944276	9946237	You're going to eat bacon?
9946257	9946637	Two years.
9948078	9948879	I'm going to eat bacon.
9949819	9950980	His bacon is yummy.
9955143	9959265	Now I know why I don't eat pork anymore.
9960886	9962027	I'm just hungry and sick.
9967611	9968251	First question.
9968271	9969112	He tastes like murder.
9970533	9971614	EvilNaoki2DX.
9971954	9972054	Oh.
9972995	9974095	It's a shameless plug.
9974156	9975276	It's not an ask question.
9975296	9976417	It's just a shameless plug.
9976457	9976857	Here it is.
9978378	9983282	Japan Town Anime Fair is this weekend at San Francisco's Japan Town.
9983342	9986224	It's at the Radisson Miyako Hotel.
9986264	9987465	I probably... Miyako.
9987505	9988345	Sorry, I'm white.
9988946	9990687	And the Best Western Miyako Inn.
9991861	9994662	Only $12 for the weekend or $8 for one day.
9994682	9995582	You want more info?
9995903	10000204	www.jtaf.com for more info.
10000584	10001865	Let me know if you need me to work.
10002985	10003325	I will.
10003425	10004126	I'll cosplay there.
10004706	10004966	All right.
10005086	10008607	In my bike and costume.
10008768	10009328	23rd Magus.
10009528	10015090	Loki, how would you go about setting an initial D machine on fire?
10015270	10016671	I need help on my technique.
10018771	10019171	Gas.
10020192	10020472	Fire.
10020492	10020572	Fire.
10021408	10029673	I don't need to eat any more bacon, I think my mouth is catching SARS or something I'm gonna have some more V8, here, hold this
10052307	10053648	So gasoline and a match.
10054149	10054369	Yeah.
10054629	10056911	That would be my advice, too.
10057432	10060795	Late at night when no one's working, you have to excuse me, I have a mouth full of bacon.
10061195	10069902	Or if you want, what you should do is pour gas over the circuitry and then leave it, you know, so when they turn it on and the game boots up, then it catches on fire and blows up.
10071944	10072525	Well, fine.
10077169	10077649	Yeah.
10077709	10078310	Better than that.
10079019	10083161	Just go in the little cabinet where you sit in to play the game and take a dump.
10084102	10085863	It's worse than setting the machine on fire.
10086483	10088924	They need that blue napalm stuff that we had when we went camping.
10089605	10090645	Because that stuff is cool.
10094307	10100891	Jason, our friend Jason, would like to know, he says, although I can't hear the answer, why?
10101031	10101851	Why aren't you listening?
10101951	10102172	Why?
10102232	10102932	What is wrong with you?
10104373	10108435	He'd like to ask Orange Lounge, why does this weekend feel so angsty like?
10109744	10111144	Baka says, I love Orange Lounge
10140394	10141315	Aw, how nice.
10141335	10142476	There was no question there, though.
10142956	10143597	What did you get?
10144357	10145478	What were you talking about?
10145538	10146459	Hey, what did you get?
10146499	10147219	He, he, silly me.
10147539	10150302	I'm getting all these little bits and pieces of a message here.
10151162	10151863	No question, though.
10156306	10157727	So we'll move on to DCB.
10157787	10158307	Hi, guys.
10160589	10161830	Oh, this is interesting.
10162250	10164632	DCB wants to know every cast member's opinion on this.
10164712	10168415	Who is outright cooler, Al Roker or Bob Saget?
10169663	10172244	and which one would you rather have live at your house?
10172484	10172784	Loki.
10173824	10176265	Al Roker is the weather guy on the Today Show.
10176305	10177045	It's going to rain.
10178406	10179626	I don't watch TV, thank you.
10180306	10183807	Al Roker had his stomach stapled and now he looks really thin.
10183907	10184787	It's kind of scary.
10185328	10196771	But Bob's saying it's cool because, one, he played a stoner in Half-Baked and, two, he played this guy in Dumb and Dumberer who said,
10197617	10199238	He's shit all over my bathroom.
10199438	10200659	There's shit everywhere.
10200879	10202039	There's shit on the mirror.
10202239	10202880	There's shit here.
10202980	10203540	It was awesome.
10204881	10213765	I would also have to say that as much as I love Al Roker, Bob Saget is cooler because, yeah, I used to suck dick for coke.
10218047	10219808	Who would I rather have live at the house, though?
10220268	10220689	Al Roker.
10220729	10222109	I would rather have Al Roker live at the house.
10222610	10222810	Why?
10222870	10224370	Bob Saget used to clean up everything.
10225531	10227232	But Al Roker can predict the weather.
10228032	10229253	Yeah, right, uh-huh.
10229914	10231395	Like, he can predict his diet.
10231755	10235999	You know what, it doesn't matter which one's chosen, because the moment they step foot in my house legally, I can shoot them.
10239903	10248130	Did you hear, now, did you hear about this, Jamie, about this news story about the guy who tried to rob the bank, and he had an explosive collar around his neck?
10248510	10249912	I know, that was cool!
10250752	10254733	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
10282390	10286051	Maple speaks and is asking us a question.
10286772	10287192	Gasp.
10287532	10289893	First, he wants to know, how do I go about listening?
10291633	10292754	Well, it's easy.
10292914	10293974	You know what?
10294054	10295735	If you're here, you're obviously listening.
10296435	10302197	But in case you forget, you can always go to, and I'll send this over private message to Maple, just in case he really isn't listening.
10302477	10303498	You can go to our website.
10303558	10304678	It's at orangelounge.com.
10307563	10311125	DarkSakura.Sky.CX, but not for much longer.
10311205	10312666	Hopefully only one more week on that.
10312926	10313187	Right?
10313827	10314327	Right, kids?
10315268	10317089	Hey, someone was supposed to be working on that website.
10317109	10318170	Yeah, well, it didn't happen.
10319931	10321152	I was too busy sucking debt for Coke.
10322272	10323073	You're a Coke head.
10323093	10325595	See, I told you that it looks like a drug mark.
10325615	10326155	Diet Coke!
10326555	10330738	Anyway, Mabel would also like to know, why am I so cool?
10332715	10335657	He ate a nasty piece of the bacon.
10335717	10338639	Loki choked on bacon when I asked that question.
10338679	10340180	No, it wasn't a choke on bacon.
10340220	10342622	It was a piece of the seasoning stuff I got.
10342642	10345003	And there was like nice crunchy charcoal-y taste.
10345764	10348846	I was like, oh, it's nasty bacon.
10348866	10351547	Oh, water.
10352188	10353308	Loki's got that nasty bacon.
10353669	10355190	Mabel wants to know why he's so cool.
10357691	10360113	If you got the ice cubes out of your pants, maybe you wouldn't be.
10362884	10363685	I like that answer.
10365005	10365826	I'm done with the bacon.
10366006	10366866	Bacon is done.
10367687	10370829	Maple's cool because he's really laid back.
10370929	10371909	He's a laid back guy.
10372510	10372950	I like that.
10377653	10377933	Alright.
10380895	10381315	Moving on.
10381375	10387819	John Fields would like to know, little kids that run across the DDR pads, what would you do to them if you didn't get in trouble for it?
10389900	10390260	Trip them.
10390301	10390921	I do all the time.
10394636	10398179	Um, I would, um, push them down a flight of stairs.
10398739	10410666	I would hang them by hooks through their skin on their back, and then I'd pour hot oil on their back, and then after they kept screaming, I'd stick sharp needles through their chin and through the sides of their cheeks, and then through their chest.
10412227	10413368	No, tell us how you really feel.
10414228	10417190	Of course, I was taken from, uh, Ichi the Killer, awesome movie.
10420792	10421833	Then I'd cut off their nipples.
10423684	10424364	and Baka.
10425264	10426965	Baka would like to admit he is random.
10427485	10428125	We figured that out.
10429726	10433527	Baka would also like us to define its definition time.
10434367	10435607	Define angst.
10439188	10439528	Alright.
10440068	10440929	Do this, Rob.
10442269	10443529	Go pull up Internet Explorer.
10446270	10449231	Type in www.dictionary.com
10452992	10454113	Type in the word angst.
10457876	10459137	Angst, by definition.
10459797	10463860	A feeling of anxiety or apprehension often accompanied by depression.
10465021	10466262	That's what angst means.
10466442	10467323	And now you know.
10467743	10469044	And knowing is half the battle.
10469204	10469744	Go Joe.
10471426	10473107	Now this, well here's the second part.
10475248	10476749	Define Fahud Lagas.
10479491	10481413	That's the sound you make after I kick your ass.
10485856	10488677	That's the sound of Jamie's leg going right at your balls.
10493998	10495719	That's my Japanese porn star name.
10498339	10499600	My Japanese porn star name.
10501120	10504561	See, you don't know it's me because I'm all mosaicked out, but that's me.
10506722	10507522	I'm a stunt cock.
10509762	10510723	We're out of questions.
10512983	10515204	Does anybody in the room have a question for somebody else?
10517867	10522750	Dear Chatroom, why do I own you so much for free?
10524230	10529113	Dear Chatroom, I look at my PayPal account every day and there's no other money in there.
10529313	10530734	Why isn't anyone giving me money?
10532955	10536917	NightmareHunter underscore, or Nightmare underscore Hunter.
10537097	10538898	Why won't any of you let me pimp you out?
10539459	10540319	We got questions.
10540579	10541040	We're saved.
10541660	10541940	Okay.
10543761	10547183	Maple would like to know, only who can prevent forest fires?
10549725	10550206	Not me.
10550646	10551487	Shit, I start them.
10554189	10559074	Actually, I actually used to live, or I kind of live, we kind of live in the middle of a forest, right?
10559474	10562657	And there was that fire just two blocks down the street a couple weeks ago.
10562997	10566200	So the fire department can prevent forest fires from consuming your home.
10566220	10570344	Because if they hadn't acted so fast, we could have been dead.
10570624	10571305	No, we were at work.
10571345	10575869	If a bear tried to prevent forest fires, he would just get consumed in the flames and die.
10576787	10578549	Only God can prevent forest fires.
10579190	10580151	Start praying, children.
10582313	10583954	All of a sudden, this is a religious show.
10584435	10587958	I know Live365 had a lot of religious stations, but shit.
10588359	10596807	You know, we need to do that thing where we go on to other Live365 stations, like the Christian Rock channels and things like that, and make fun of them.
10596927	10598189	Listen to them and make fun of them.
10598909	10599550	Maybe another time.
10602116	10603317	I can do that.
10603837	10607059	DCB would like to know, why do women have boobs?
10609640	10610821	He has an answer, though, too.
10611261	10613462	So you have something to look at when you're talking to them.
10615063	10615543	Family guy.
10621967	10623988	If you could see Jamie's face.
10624628	10625849	I'm trying not to laugh.
10630432	10630572	See...
10632561	10634603	We have cushioning where you guys have targets.
10638005	10638526	Think about it.
10642088	10643830	I don't... Why do women have boobs?
10643990	10645731	I mean, obviously the breast milk's there.
10647352	10650014	But they don't have to be, you know, so big some of the times.
10650074	10651675	I mean, babies don't drink that much.
10654798	10655538	Estrogen!
10655598	10656059	Hello?
10656079	10656199	Hello?
10657655	10658455	Yeah, but still.
10658495	10661497	I'm talking like Jerry Springer boobs.
10661517	10662677	Yeah, but why do people get the boobs off?
10662697	10665258	What I don't understand is my nuts aren't that big, so I mean.
10665419	10666019	Yeah, that's true.
10666039	10668120	Why can't my nuts be as big as women's boobs?
10668140	10670021	Because that would really hurt.
10672021	10676403	Having boobs does not hurt unless you have really big boobs and then your back hurts all the time.
10677644	10680805	I mean, I'm not even going to get started on that one.
10682266	10684427	Okay, I know I have big boobs.
10686505	10687366	I'm... You have nice boobs.
10687526	10688387	You have nice boobs.
10688427	10689929	Don't look at my boobs.
10691390	10691770	It's okay.
10691810	10693572	He's, you know, gay, so... Okay.
10693712	10693912	Yeah.
10693972	10694733	But... Ah!
10695574	10697456	No, you have a boob fixation.
10699298	10699518	But...
10701926	10709609	I would say that when you get into the double D's, there were these women at my elementary school.
10709669	10714031	I was so afraid of them because they had boobs that were as big as me when I was five.
10715652	10722075	And that's the time to go save up your money and go get a boob job because that's too heavy.
10722375	10727017	When you have boobs large enough to hold Matrix babies in them, that's when you have to be concerned.
10727437	10729057	Actually, I'm not kidding.
10729438	10730198	They were that large.
10730805	10738790	The triple, like, the ones that get, like, the triple G or... I didn't get, like, when I watched Geraldo one day, these women were, like, expanding themselves as novelty models.
10739771	10743133	What the hell's the point of a, you know, why don't they, like, add, like, squirrel... To G size.
10743373	10745655	Squirrel tails or something like that, you know, something funny.
10747496	10748077	Claws.
10750158	10760065	And the people with small boobs who, you know, want big boobs, you know what, be happy with what you have, because having big boobs isn't everything, except you get a lot more dates.
10763519	10765521	What is the best racist joke you know of?
10765601	10767223	I'll tell a Helen Keller joke.
10767243	10768103	Those are funny.
10768123	10769605	How do Helen Keller's parents punish her?
10784451	10785732	by rearranging the furniture.
10788474	10790095	It's funny because she's blind.
10792096	10793977	That's not really racist, but you know.
10796419	10797299	A deaf joke, okay.
10798000	10799741	Of course I learned this joke from a deaf person.
10801342	10811068	Three people were, there was a big conference and a deaf guy was sitting with an American guy and there was a Russian guy and a Mexican guy.
10812634	10813215	No, I'm not saying that.
10813235	10813695	Cuban guy.
10814856	10817218	And Cuban guy stands up and walks over to a window.
10817298	10819580	He takes a puff of a cigar and throws it out the window.
10820641	10824024	And the deaf guy signs to him, you know, why did you throw the cigar out the window?
10824044	10824744	He's like, oh, it's pretty.
10824824	10826806	Cigars in Cuba, you know, hey, Cuban cigars.
10827406	10831370	So the deaf guy just sits back and, you know, goes along with watching the conference, you know.
10831890	10836174	And then the Russian guy gets up and takes a big swig of vodka and throws a bottle out the window.
10836674	10838275	He's like, well, why did you throw the vodka out the window?
10838296	10839857	It's pretty vodka in Russia, you know.
10840825	10841666	Russia, Vodka.
10842206	10844048	So, deaf guy's sitting there, he's thinking.
10844709	10848472	So he goes up and opens the window, picks up the American guy and throws him out the window.
10848873	10849714	He's like, where'd you do that?
10849994	10851235	Plenty of hearing people in America.
10854438	10855099	I have a gay joke.
10856540	10858062	How do you make a gay guy scream twice?
10859503	10861785	Fuck him in the ass and then wipe your cock on the curtains.
10866580	10874163	Um, Mabel would also like to know, um, when you were talking about big boobs, were you making fun of me being fat?
10874904	10878085	I don't know how he gets fat out of that, but... Yes.
10878645	10880206	Yes, we were.
10881607	10882747	Do your boobs produce milk?
10883047	10884628	Do you drink a lot of breast milk?
10885008	10885528	Do you go move?
10885548	10888429	You know they have lactation pads that you can put in your bra now.
10888490	10889210	We should get you some.
10890350	10891671	Now that's making fun, see?
10892589	10894910	Why are people so, you know... Why are people self-conscious?
10895530	10896051	I don't know.
10896431	10897651	It's like you have your own creamer.
10897972	10898592	It's awesome.
10898632	10901673	Well, you know, I would be self-conscious.
10901973	10902254	Okay.
10903014	10906716	First of all, if you've never... That's the other reason why I'm not having children.
10908657	10917721	I can't even find... After sitting for 30 minutes listening to my stepsister telling me about what it feels like to lactate, no children for me, thank you.
10919645	10921206	I'll come back to Mabel's last question a little bit.
10921386	10923727	Nince would like to say, not a question, but a comment.
10924788	10928490	If only God can prevent forest fires, well, then they'll always start.
10930531	10931691	Thank you.
10931831	10932472	You da funny.
10935713	10940856	Rice Princess is asking when we're going to update the damn website, because she doesn't want to plug it if it's not updated.
10942277	10947940	We've made steps to get a new website constructed, but it's just coming along slowly.
10947960	10948660	Of course.
10951009	10952770	We need to have it done soon, though.
10952890	10953390	I know we do.
10953470	10954331	So hopefully this week.
10954351	10961196	I feel like an alien is going to pop out of my stomach.
10961216	10964178	You're going to be okay, though, right?
10964658	10966579	See, I'm immune to the pork and grease.
10967660	10971723	John Fields says, Should Weird Al do a parody of a Linkin Park song?
10971783	10972143	Yes.
10972443	10972663	No.
10973344	10973744	Yes.
10974144	10974425	Has he?
10974505	10974705	What?
10974905	10975826	Angry White Boy Polka.
10976266	10976986	Is Linkin Park in there?
10977166	10977467	Might be.
10977767	10977887	Okay.
10979813	10982774	Gur would like to know, why is it so hard to get rid of hiccups?
10984315	10984635	I don't know.
10984655	10986036	Why is it so hard to get rid of Mexicans?
10992519	10996061	Thank you for answering two questions and one there with Naples joke as well.
10996101	10996661	Thank you.
10998282	11002264	I just thought I'd like to address the other comment there.
11003104	11003464	I don't know.
11004445	11005405	I'm not really racist.
11005445	11007126	I just play one on the radio.
11011849	11012209	Okay.
11012829	11013930	Maple's last question.
11014010	11016171	Why aren't you accepting any more questions?
11016931	11018471	Because, kids, it's the end of the show.
11020332	11022873	And Ask Orange Lounge is now finished.
11022993	11024714	Yeah, but Rice Princess, I'm not racist.
11024834	11026414	I hate everyone equally, see?
11028875	11031696	Ask Orange Lounge is now over and done.
11032316	11033857	Let's not shoot a dead horse.
11034017	11035597	Let's get on to the next segment.
11036098	11037218	I'm going to puke from the pork.
11037658	11038899	The pork is really nasty.
11039719	11040059	Okay.
11043950	11045111	Um, final thoughts?
11046652	11046913	Loki.
11048053	11049555	Thank God the pork is gone.
11049775	11051876	I'm not eating any more bacon for a while.
11054698	11057981	My final thought is, um, I hate Walmart.
11058021	11059282	No, I'm not going to get over it.
11061904	11063625	Now I remember why I gave up pork.
11064935	11069377	I'm also very sad because I just spent $340 on arcade buttons.
11070817	11071418	That is sad.
11072778	11073859	Final word of the show.
11075279	11076299	I ought to take it myself.
11076680	11077400	I'll give it to Jamie.
11077420	11078901	I know she always likes to have the final word.
11078941	11079241	Here it is.
11082902	11087344	The final word of the evening is puce.
11089029	11091432	You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
11091892	11095777	Orange Lounge Radio is hosted by Dark Sakura, Sky, and Loki.
11096178	11098040	We expect you a nice play again.
11098520	11101284	And now, here's your fortune cookie message of the day.
11108829	11126509	Stop, collaborate and listen, BK's back with my brand new invention, something grabs a hold of me tightly, flow like a harpoon, daily and nightly, would it ever stop you, I don't know, turn on the light, and I'll go to the extreme.
11127129	11148941	I rock a mic like a vandal Light up a stage and watch me jump like a candle Damn, yeah, I'm kicking that boom I'm poisonous like a poisonous mushroom If there is a problem, yo, I'll solve it Check out the hook while my DJ revolves it Ice, ice, baby, too cold, too cold Ice, ice, baby, too cold, too cold
11154645	11156086	Thank you for watching!
11173218	11195574	Rock a mic like a vandal Light up a stage and watch me jump like a candle Damn, yeah, I'm kickin' that boom I'm poisonous like a poisonous mushroom If there is a problem, baby, I will solve it Check out the book while my DJ revolves it Ice, ice, baby, too cold to hold Ice, ice, baby, too cold to hold
11201972	11204496	Thanks for listening and we'll see you next week.
11253792	11254573	I like this song.
11258175	11259856	This reminds me of Ferris Bueller's Day Off.
11259876	11263498	Yeah, that's why DCB sent this song to me, because it reminds him of Ferris Bueller's Day Off.
11264779	11266079	That movie is so cool.
11266119	11268461	Anyway, yes, hi, welcome to the Orange Lounge Radio Afterbirth.
11271772	11274654	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
11291269	11295671	We went to Walmart and bought Trivial Pursuit, the 20th anniversary edition, and brought it home and played.
11295711	11299313	It was me, Brad, Irene, Loki, and Nellie, Loki's girlfriend.
11299713	11300273	We were all playing.
11300674	11301874	And hilarity.
11302034	11303155	It was absolutely hilarious.
11303215	11305016	We got some of the most funniest answers ever.
11305456	11307077	Like, I was asking Nellie a question.
11307117	11309298	I was trying to get everybody's attention because everybody was talking.
11309318	11310919	I wanted to ask a question, so I went, which?
11311539	11312740	And I was like, which?
11312940	11317442	Like, I was starting the question, which one of the... And Irene's all, don't call her a witch.
11319025	11319945	This is funny, he had to be there.
11320505	11323606	And then we learned that there is a cat exhibit at the local aquarium.
11324746	11328627	And we also learned that Stephen King directed E.T.
11330628	11332588	I'm going to get punched in the face for that one, but that's okay.
11336429	11337489	I gotta fuck you, Rob.
11339349	11340230	I gotta fuck you.
11342650	11343250	I'm sorry, what?
11343670	11344111	What, Jamie?
11344431	11346071	Jamie has clean clothes, she's celebrating.
11346437	11349859	I can smell clean clothes because the fans blow and the clean clothes smell this way.
11350620	11352061	Smells like clean clotheness.
11358025	11360487	Thank you all for listening to and supporting Orange Lounge Radio.
11360527	11361348	We do appreciate it.
11361548	11362508	It's very nice of you.
11367152	11369053	I think we're pretty much done.
11369073	11370534	Jamie, do you have anything you want to say?
11372295	11373196	Get your ass over here.
11377378	11380141	Who needs potpourri when you can have clean laundry?
11380161	11391755	Sprinkle detergent all over your house.
11397757	11399598	No, you want to know get away the clean clothes?
11399838	11405520	Or not really clean clothes, but give it... Give the impression of clean clothes?
11405920	11407380	Rubber dryer sheet on yourself.
11409281	11410241	That's so ghetto.
11410541	11417524	That's like something you'd hear on... That's like something you'd... Do you smell my butt?
11417564	11418644	Rob just smelled my butt.
11418704	11419584	I smelled your butt.
11420285	11421605	It smells April fresh.
11426027	11426747	That was beautiful.
11432617	11435038	Okay, sex, blood, violence, and bloodshed.
11435778	11446200	Well, there's this movie, Ichi the Killer, where this guy beats up this prostitute and they cut off her nipples, as I mentioned earlier, and there's lots of blood from that.
11446621	11449421	So that has sex, violence, and bloodshed.
11449441	11450822	What a lovely thought, thank you.
11451862	11452562	It's a great movie, though.
11455300	11457101	Everything with the same prostitute.
11458422	11459563	Or different prostitute, actually.
11459943	11462065	Gets her leg cut off and she's hobbling on one foot.
11463185	11463445	Funny.
11465207	11465427	Funny.
11469970	11470270	Okay.
11472051	11472691	I think we're done.
11473672	11474933	I'll be nicer when you're smarter.
11475802	11476402	Good night, everybody.
11476422	11478023	Thank you for supporting Orange Lounge Radio.
11478063	11478803	We appreciate it.
11479023	11482785	After the show tonight, we have for you guys a Dance Mania marathon.
11482845	11483185	Yay!
11483205	11487207	A whole bunch of thrown-together tracks from your favorite Dance Mania albums.
11487247	11488127	That should be exciting.
11488147	11490148	There's a whole bunch of albums in here.
11492269	11493429	I'm sure you guys will enjoy it.
11493489	11494230	Oh, I have to add one more.
11494250	11495930	I want to make sure EX4 gets in here, too.
11496030	11499152	So, Loki, say something else while I get this ready.
11500032	11504435	If you give me money, I will invite you over to play in the arcade cabinet, because it will be sweet.
11504955	11508257	But no one has given me money except for Vandalus.
11508297	11510939	And Vandalus, you're more than welcome to come over when I'm done.
11513180	11513920	Yeah, but he gave me $10.
11513980	11519564	That's alright.
11519664	11521485	Well, you're more than welcome to come over.
11521545	11523606	You're always... Woo, court!
11523826	11523946	Ah!
11524387	11524747	Change.
11526828	11529530	Yeah, but she just did laundry here, so that's more like a laundromat.
11530126	11530606	Oh yeah.
11531967	11532648	Yeah.
11533748	11535329	I'm going to use it as a piggy bank also.
11535589	11536890	It's a $60 piggy bank.
11536950	11538671	Stupid fucking coin door costs that much.
11542193	11542594	But, um...
11544079	11544960	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
11563143	11565284	Okay, we're going to do a Dance Mania Marathon now.

11579133	11579654	Bye, guys.
11579674	11580274	Thanks for listening.
11580294	11583437	I will fart continuously on the mic on Wednesday night.
11583817	11590844	Wednesday might just be a... If we can't get Zero to commit to a show, we might just do a live Trivial Pursuit game on air.
11591384	11592726	I know what we should call the show.
11592886	11593106	What?
11593406	11594988	I set myself on fire.
11597110	11597490	All right.
11597850	11598511	Good night, everybody.
11598551	11599972	Thanks for listening to Sporting Orange Sounds Radio.
