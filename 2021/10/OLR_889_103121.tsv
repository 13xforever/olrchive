0	14720	This week, we're back to bring you spooky, frightful, and delightful gaming news. Because
14720	18880	for some reason, society sees adults going door to door to collect candy socially unacceptable
18880	25040	for some reason. That's okay, I wanted savory, sugar-free candy anyway, because health matters
25040	31120	when you're an adult. Anyway, now it's time for your hosts Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers,
31120	34400	and Loki to bring you two weeks of gaming news, starting right now on the show where
34400	47840	every gamer has a voice. Welcome back to another weekly show where every gamer has a voice. It is
47840	58320	Orange Lounge Radio, and we are live on Halloween, spooky season. This is episode number 889 for this
58320	65680	October 31st, Halloween of 2021. We are back after not being here last week, but we are very happy
65680	70080	to be back to talk about the latest in video games, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.
70080	74800	My name is Rob Roberts, and I am joined every week by the one and only DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
75440	82640	Oh, hi. Hi, how are you? I'm a little warm, but I'm okay. So for the Twitch people, because we do
82640	86160	tape live every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern, right after the
86160	91360	Bobby Blackwell show at VOG Network, twitch.tv slash VOG Network. And for the folks that are
91360	96000	watching on Twitch tonight, you're dressed up a little bit. You're doing a little Meg from Dead
96000	100960	by Daylight inspired look here. And so you're committed to your art with the jacket there. I am.
100960	105120	Love that. The funny thing is that I had ordered this like cheap ass terrible jacket,
105120	112080	and then I found this actual legit corduroy jacket. And that's what Meg wears. And I'll link
112080	117520	like the cosmetic. And then I got my wig and my wig's the wrong color because it's not like
117520	124080	red enough. I either have a very red wig or the blonde wig. Out of my collection of wigs,
124080	130160	I do not own a strawberry blonde. And I had everything ready and styled. And then I was
130160	138560	just looking at my, uh, just Meg cosmetics and Meg has a Bob hair, a Bob haircut. That
138560	143280	it's like her athletic Bob and it looks a little bit like curly and stringy a little.
144480	149040	And she's also got like her straightened out one, but it's more of an ombre effect. And I was like,
149040	153440	yeah, this will do. Um, I just have to make sure I'm cultivating my resting bitch face
153440	156800	better. And she doesn't have the Klingon forehead that I do, but oh, well.
156800	161360	I am surprised you don't have the, because you love pig who is the killer. I'm surprised you
161360	166560	don't have Megan, the pig mask for your, I was just a little bit surprised. I actually,
166560	170080	uh, didn't have time to make the pig mask. I was supposed to make it. And then I had to go to
170080	175840	Alabama next year, next year. Yeah. Cause I was going to have like the, the pig mask hanging off
175840	183520	to the side. And I, I had another red wig that I was going to do like her triple braid in and
183520	190160	with everything that happened in the last couple of weeks. Sure. That fell off. Um, meanwhile,
190160	194480	I am not dressed up. I'm dressed up as Rob Roberts, uh, orange on his radio host here on stream
194480	199600	tonight because, uh, I w I hosted. So for the first time in 18 months, um, I've talked about
199600	204160	this on a show before I host, uh, with one of the film festivals here, I do a lot of the cult movie
204160	209920	screenings and variety show stuff. So, uh, Rocky horror was back last night after 18 months being
209920	213440	gone. You know, they still did precautions. Everybody had to be vaccinated. Everybody was
213440	218320	wearing massive stuff and it felt, it felt really good to be back, um, doing that again. Uh, and
218320	222720	then there was a variety show on Friday night, um, cabaret macabre, which went really, really well.
222720	227040	And, uh, yeah, so I dressed up for those events. So today I was like, you know what? I'm, I'm
227040	232320	casual tonight. Halloween is over for me. It was the weekend was the highlights there. That's for
232320	237680	sure. Um, and going to our chat because again, we do tape live at twitch.tv slash vog network,
237680	243360	where SSJ 100, Matt says to hosting gigs and you still have your voice. Yeah. I tried to keep it
243360	248240	under control this weekend, but I do feel like I'm an octave lower tonight than I usually am.
248240	253680	That's for sure. Um, speaking of spooky season, tech master, Loki, not here with us tonight,
253680	257600	as you can see. Uh, and for those in the podcast feed, he is not here tonight. Uh,
257600	261680	but he mentioned on a previous episode, he is still obligated to take the kids trick or treating
261680	266160	because it is Halloween. So, I mean, understandable. So he is out doing a family
266160	270160	stuff tonight on Halloween. We'll probably have a little bit of a shorter show tonight,
270160	274400	just because it is Halloween. That world series thing is going on that has a lot of people's
274400	278640	attention. My cat is over here in the kitchen screaming. So Lord knows what I hear him.
280800	286400	And he only does this. I swear you guys, he only does this when I'm doing a well are like,
287040	291120	or when I'm taking a shower, he'll sit, sit outside the bathroom door and screen.
291120	295840	So it's the song of his people, apparently my gosh. And he just ate too. What a
296640	303200	fat kitty. All right. Um, Midna has lost two pounds and is now in her healthy range.
303200	306480	So I have worked hard on her. Glad to hear it. Let me hear it. Cause
307120	311440	a chunky cat is not a healthy cat. I'm just saying actually, and actually believe it or not,
311440	316880	Mr. Smoosh is at the weight he needs to be. It's just, his species is a natural chonker.
316880	321040	Oh yeah. So yeah, no, that, that's a different thing just because of how he's built,
321040	328480	but like Midna being a little black cat, she is supposed to be, she, she has that,
328480	332720	that pouch and that's actually a genetic leftover. It's not, it's not chunkiness.
333760	338560	Um, but she's finally where she should be and she's got a lot more energy and she's happy.
338560	342640	Good, good. Sometimes she has too much energy. I miss Midna. I haven't seen her in a while.
342640	346720	I need to come over and play pinball. We're about to, we may be selling the shadow.
347360	352560	Oh no. We have Star Trek now. Oh fun. Good time. And of course, pinball machines for
352560	357120	those that are not aware that Dar Sakura and Hubby collect pinball machines. It's fun stuff.
357120	361280	They sure do. Um, okay. We'll talk a little more about our week off cause I know both you and I
361280	365200	went on a trip except different trips. So we'll talk a little bit about that in a bit. But I
365200	370560	thought, you know, since we are video games, let's get into our first topic tonight, which is kind of
370560	374800	covering really what we missed in that week that we were off because I feel like there was more
374800	378480	news last week than there was this week. We had some big headlines this week. We'll get into in a
378480	382960	minute, but there was a bit of news, um, last week while we were off. Um, so running through some of
382960	387680	the big headlines, uh, Metroid dread got that patch that we had been talking about on an earlier
387680	393520	show. Um, so patch 1.0 0.1 and Metroid dread is now out and it fixes that, uh, you know, kind of
394640	400080	broken thing that prevented people from beating the game, but it was coming off. It's fine. I
400080	404960	understand. Not everybody was really gonna hit that anyway. Um, also this kind of interesting,
404960	408640	uh, the Capcom arcade stadium. I don't know if you've checked, checked this out dark soccer,
408640	413680	but it's a great collection of old, uh, Capcom games. And so, uh, if you want to play the one
413680	418160	on switch, right? Yeah. Well, it's on all of them, but switch. Yeah. Yeah. If you don't,
418160	423280	if you don't want to buy games in bulk, they just, uh, released that you can buy each title
423280	428240	separately for $2. So if you only want Strider, you only have to pay the $2 for Strider, which is
428240	432800	kind of nice. So, um, or whatever it is that you want to get. Meanwhile, I bought all of the
432800	438560	bundles on switch before they did this. I want to see them do more like there's still more games.
438560	444640	I want to see them put out. So hopefully it's been doing well enough. This is a huge headline in the
444640	450240	blizzard universe and Overwatch. Um, you know, everybody knows that there was a lot of problems
450240	454160	at blizzard that have had to be worked out, um, in the past few months and are continuing to be
454160	458720	worked on. Um, but one of them was the fact that, uh, one of the characters, the cowboy character
458720	464240	in Overwatch was named after somebody with the company that proved to have a pretty problematic
464240	469840	past. So, uh, they had said they were going to rename this character and they announced the
469840	476080	new name last week. Uh, the character formerly known as McCree is now Cole Cassidy is the name
476080	481680	of that character. Um, and definitely, you know, butch Cassidy probably coming into play there.
481680	488400	But what I also think is really funny is that, um, the character of Ash voiced by O.L.R. fave
488400	494160	Jennifer Hale, uh, who, um, was added later on. Uh, I just think it's really funny that the
494160	499600	characters are Ash and Cole. Get it? Even though his name is spelled C O L E still it's Ash and
499600	506240	Cole. Ha ha ha ha. All right, forget it. What reference is this that I'm missing?
506240	511600	It's just Ash and Cole. Like, like they're both fire burning related things. I don't know.
511600	515920	Okay. I thought that it was like famous, like people.
515920	521360	No, well, the Cassidy part likely is, but that's, uh, yeah, that's it. Um,
522400	527760	Questbuster in chat also with another point there saying, if I recall correctly, uh, also with the
527760	532720	rename, Blizzard said they would stop naming characters in any of their games after real
532720	539200	people. You know what though? I, I, I actually, I don't know if I agree with that. And I know
539200	543520	that might sound surprising, especially, you know, considering this particular character, but like,
543520	549360	I know in world of Warcraft, they have named characters in tribute for some that have passed
549360	555600	away. Um, I also know some items have, uh, names from the real world. I mean, that's,
555600	560480	I don't know, maybe give or take, cause you never know where, you know, where those peoples are at,
560480	566000	but I think especially the ones that are named in memoriam, um, I would, I would like to see them
566000	570880	do that. Maybe they should amend it that they shouldn't name them after living employees or
570880	575120	something. Yeah. Yeah. I think that's the way to do it. Don't name them after living employees.
575120	580160	And I think that would be a better way to handle that. But I, I, I get like where they were going
580160	585920	with that for sure. I think this is a really interesting story. Hamster has filed a trademark
585920	590240	and yes, hamster is a game company. If you weren't already aware, and they're probably most
590240	596000	well known, I think they're the ones that do the arcade archives, which is a huge series, um, that
596000	601360	is on the Nintendo switch. And I think it's shows up on like PlayStation four, a lot of old arcade
601360	607200	games. Well, in the last week, they actually put out a trademark or they filed a trademark for
607200	613200	console archives. And I think this is really fascinating, especially if the Nintendo switch
613200	620240	is involved because essentially hamster. I mean, if you, if you're to jump to conclusions about
620240	624640	what this name means, which I don't know why you wouldn't, uh, this might mean that hamster is
624640	630960	putting together a third party virtual console. Wow. Of sorts. Um, you know, granted this could
630960	636800	include systems that are not represented on the Nintendo switch and that's probably where it's
636800	641600	going to end up. It couldn't, I know Konami has worked a lot with arcade archives. I think
641600	647280	turbo graphics 16 is a very, cause you know, Konami now that's one of the same. I think
647280	652000	there's a very likely place for turbo graphics things to end up, but there could be more than
652000	657680	just that. Um, I know SNK, although, you know, when it comes to the Neo Geo, I think pretty
657680	662720	much all the home stuff was the arcade stuff that was kind of the, the allure of that system.
662720	667680	I'm not sure what I'm not thinking of unless maybe, um, dark soccer, things like SNK pocket
667680	671600	and some of the things I know you followed a little more closely, maybe will be represented
671600	677280	here. I don't know. That would be nice. Yeah. So I don't think console archives is suddenly
677280	682000	going to mean things like Genesis, Nintendo and things like that. I just don't see it going that
682000	688800	way, especially on the switch. But I think the more obscure Japanese only type of stuff, there
688800	693840	actually could be a pretty cool market here. What if they started putting out like MSX and MSX too?
693840	700320	Like that would be rad. And I could see that happening from hamster. So, um, fingers crossed
700320	703840	that that's kind of where this going is really, um, bringing some of those more obscure titles
703840	710560	to light. So anyway, arcade archives has been running since March 3rd, 2017, 200 weeks of,
710560	715680	uh, systems. The last, uh, game they released was rally X, which, uh, I, I love that game.
715680	721440	That's one of the few games I have a perfect achievement list, 200 out of 200 on Xbox 360
721440	725760	was yeah. Right. The random rally X remake. I don't know why I love that game so much,
725760	730560	but I do. It's weird. I'll be the first one to get it. Yeah, it is. Um, let's see,
730560	736880	going to chat twitch.tv slash a VOG and network, uh, SSJ 100, Matt suggesting on the, uh, naming,
736880	743600	uh, after people named them after pets instead for blizzards. So we could have like a Mr. Smoosh
743600	747760	in the, I like that idea, the pets. All right. And again, what if you have a pet that's like
747760	757840	named after like a person and this is Walter. Yeah. The brave. Yeah. The kind of, um, some
757840	763280	comments on the, uh, uh, console archive story, dark Tetsuya says, sign me up for MSX stuff.
763280	769280	Right. Like I know we've had a year. I know we've kind of had the metal gear release on,
769280	775440	but it would be really nice to have these. Oh, holy fuck. Yes. Guard it. Although you can get
775440	781600	guardick on iPhone and guardick. Wasn't really a great game to say. But what if like we could
781600	785920	finally get guardian legend through this? I would be so excited even though that is an NES game,
785920	790240	but you never know. I still wish that that fan remake had been allowed to go through. That would
790240	795280	have been such a delight for sure. Um, quest buster and chat says, yay, more hamster retro.
795280	800640	I'm also keeping my fingers crossed on Japanese only classics. So many never made it here. And
800640	804640	yeah, I, you know, again, there's, it's a trademark. There's only so much we can do.
804640	810320	We can jump to conclusions, but I feel like with the arcade archives, like nothing was off limits
810320	816320	for hamster. If you really look at the, I mean, they've released 200 games. There's a lot of
816320	821280	obscure shit in there. Like let's be real. So like if they can do this for console games too,
821280	826720	I think it's going to be awesome. Like in kudos to them for, um, preserving, you know, these,
826720	832400	these, uh, obscure sometimes gaming history. Maybe they'll use dark soccer's classic game of the week
832400	837040	list on our Wiki as a guide of what we want to see. So you think we're going to get like puzzling
837040	846000	does, uh, miss nude world 96. If there's any justice, everybody move your body, move your
846000	852480	body. Okay. One of the greatest in jokes ever on this show is miss nude world 96. Yes. It is
852480	858480	an actual game. It plays just like kicks Q I X. If you remember that game place, just like that.
858480	866400	But instead of just filling in colored squares, you unlock a scantily clad woman. Cause you know,
866400	872640	games were like, really fucking, you know, sometimes they were really misogynistic in the
872640	880640	nineties. Yeah. Who doesn't, um, but then for whatever reason, sometimes the game would like,
880640	885120	you do something bad, I guess. And then suddenly it turns into a picture of a hell demon.
885120	890720	And it plays this really cheesy techno song in the background that goes, everybody move your body.
892320	896880	So I don't know if there's any clips on YouTube, but seriously look it up. It's, it's hilarious.
896880	901920	It's just, it's hilarious how ridiculous it is. It is a fucking ridiculous game,
901920	908960	but that's why we can't stop talking about it. All right. Dark Tetsuya is saying, I don't know,
908960	913440	the ESRB might not be kind to miss nude world. Okay. You know what they have to do?
914400	920000	Let me ESRB can bite my ass here. Here we go. They I'm going to refer to a really obscure news
920000	924320	story from this week. So going back to this week, I don't know if you guys heard, but there's,
924320	928480	there's a trailer out there for a really, and I'm going to be honest, the game looks like garbage.
928480	933840	It looks like a ripoff of super meat boy, quite frankly. Um, and it's called on the Nintendo
933840	938080	switch. It's called, I think it's called 20 women. Somebody in chat can correct me if you know what
938080	943600	I'm talking about. And basically by beating these crappy levels, you unlock pictures of
943600	950400	scantily clad women who are way wearing basically bathing suits that show off their big assets.
950400	955840	Okay. So there's that, but on the PlayStation, they were not able to release this game the same
955840	962560	way. So instead they made a game called 20 bunnies. And at the end of each level,
962560	967040	you unlock pictures of cute bunnies. They're not scant and clad or anything. They're just
967040	973680	cute bunnies, right? The bunnies are better. Now this game looks like fucking garbage,
973680	978480	so I'm not going to buy it just for pictures of bunnies, but to go back to miss world,
978480	984160	miss nude world 96. That is how you release the game is you do miss bunny 96
986160	990960	and that's how hamster can do it. Thank you. That's funny. Pixel pockets knew what I was
990960	994800	talking about. Turn the ladies into bunnies. Yes. Thank you. Tiger claw got the real name
994800	998800	of the game. It's called 20 ladies, not 20 women. Sorry about that. 20 ladies
998800	1003680	and a links to a story that Nintendo life ran on the whole thing. So anyway,
1004560	1009520	quest buster and chat says cute bunnies for everyone, right? Pod culture says bunnies
1009520	1017440	aren't just cute likes everyone. Everybody suppose. All right. Anyway, where was I? Let
1017440	1021440	me go back to the headlines from last week. Cause I know I've missed some things here.
1021440	1025760	I accidentally closed the window. Um, getting back to it.
1028800	1032080	I have to log into my site again to see my headlines. Okay. Here we go.
1032080	1040480	Uh, fun times. Oh, um, RIP. We did love a radio. We did lose, um, uh, pixel artists from Namco,
1040480	1045920	very famous pixel artists. Hiroshi Ono passed away in the week that we were gone. Yeah. So,
1045920	1048880	I mean, I didn't mean that as a pun and I'm sorry I said it that way, but I meant,
1049520	1055680	Oh, no, legit. Yeah. So, yeah. Uh, sorry to hear about that loss. Um, that is unfortunate. And,
1055680	1061200	uh, also in the news, we have, uh, the next game from the Stardew Valley creator
1061200	1066080	is going to be haunted chocolatier. So that sounds like it could be very interesting. I wonder if
1066080	1070240	it'll be as chill as Stardew Valley is. I don't know when they're talking about haunted. I'm not
1070240	1074960	sure if it's really going to be chill, but we'll see. So those are some of the big headlines we
1074960	1079120	missed last week in the week that we were off. So speaking of the week we were off,
1079120	1083360	let's talk about our gaming weeks and the types of video games that we have been playing this week.
1084720	1086960	I have to interject something. Sure. Go ahead.
1087680	1090880	Steve Buscemi just went Halloween. He dressed as his meme.
1092160	1095920	Uh, how do you do fellow kids? That one. Exactly. He dressed as his meme.
1095920	1100960	I love it. And handed out candy. Uh, I heard what's her name from the movie Midsommar,
1100960	1105360	which I know you love that movie Florence something. Uh, she dressed up as her character
1105360	1108240	for Midsommar for Halloween. I have to find pictures of that.
1109280	1114240	It's on Twitter somewhere. All right. Uh, let's get into our gaming weeks and with our gaming
1114240	1117680	weeks. Um, I figured we might talk about the trips a little bit because I know,
1117680	1121120	I don't know about you dark soccer, but I kind of played less games this week because I went
1121120	1124960	out of town for a few days, but, um, I don't know. Tell us, tell us about your trip and your gaming
1124960	1130320	week, dark soccer. So, yeah, I didn't really play a lot of games, although, um, of course the Monday
1131040	1136720	last I played, uh, uh, I tried to, I tried to keep up with my streaming and I did some dead
1136720	1143600	by daylight. Um, and I, I did not play Fantasian because the new content I thought was coming out
1143600	1151680	on that Tuesday and I was wrong. Um, so it's really was dead by daylight. Um, playing, uh,
1151680	1156800	word scapes, um, really not much of anything. I'm going to be starting at animal crossing again when
1156800	1166000	the new DLC is out. Um, and, uh, as expected, uh, JD did, uh, change our family plan. So I
1166000	1170880	have access to all the N64 stuff now and that's pretty fun. Um, I don't know if I'm going to play
1170880	1176720	anything yet, but I really have hardly had time to do anything. My, my cosplay is so half-assed
1176720	1183200	because I didn't have time to do anything. Um, I, I was in Alabama. Um, I didn't play any games in
1183200	1193440	Alabama. Um, uh, uh, Tiara and I went to go, uh, spend time with our mama son, Maggie. Um,
1193440	1201440	and we went to, uh, Barbara's, uh, Memorial, um, was really sweet. Um, there, there was a lot of
1201440	1210000	uncomfortable Christian stuff, but it's not my deal. Um, and there was this cute picture of,
1210000	1214480	uh, Barbara holding a lightsaber and I had never seen it. So it was,
1214480	1223760	I got to see some different pictures. Um, and, uh, then, uh, we caught up with some of her friends
1223760	1228800	and then they found out a big thing. You know, we had a commonality of liking electric light
1228800	1235280	orchestra and it was, it was, it was some random stuff. And then we went to olive garden, which is
1235280	1242320	fine dining for Mobile, Alabama. Um, well, there actually is, there's like a Ruth's Chris and some
1242320	1248000	other places that are nice, like the Admiral Sims and whatnot. But, um, but we went to olive garden
1248000	1252160	and had, had food and it was great. And Tiara and I stole the breadsticks.
1252960	1257440	Olive Garden is that place I really crave like once a year, like once a year, I'm like,
1257440	1261760	I want some fucking breadsticks and I want it now. We had, we had to keep upgrading our tables and
1261760	1264480	we were finally like, you know, we're just going to take this table over here and the stuff's like,
1264480	1270640	whatever. Sure. Um, and we had a really good time, you know, um, the happy times were happy.
1270640	1275920	We had some sad, you know, reminiscing. Um, my mother did manage to stick her foot in her
1275920	1285040	mouth when we had mom brunch, had her and Maggie for brunch with us. Um, and, uh, I was very happy
1285040	1290000	because, um, there were, there were many gays at brunch and it made me feel like I was at gay
1290000	1297280	brunch. So nice. And really good mimosas, just saying, of course. So is this place called the
1297280	1301040	August house. If anyone is in Mobile, Alabama, they're really expensive for their brunch,
1301040	1305360	but they are quite delightful. Um, we also went to this place called the cheese cottage,
1305360	1308240	which we just were like, we're going to the cheese cottage by name alone.
1309200	1315760	And it was really, really, really good. I mean, like you order a charcuterie boards and whatnot,
1315760	1319840	but they also had like really delicious sandwiches and there was a dude out there
1319840	1325680	playing guitar and he was really good, but he did the thing. He played wonder wall.
1326800	1333360	I saw this on like your Instagram or whatever. I put it on Tik TOK because that man turned himself
1333360	1339120	into a living meme. That's funny anyway. And we were singing with him. It was great. Um, but yeah,
1339200	1345680	I ended up spending, um, a good, uh, my, my, pretty much almost my whole Sunday with my mom
1346320	1352400	and I got to see my, my brother Phillip. And I finally got to meet my nephew Jackson
1353120	1358000	and Ashley was back from Afghanistan. She, um, she's army reserve, uh, medical.
1358000	1362960	And so she had just gotten back, I think like a few weeks before. Um, and then I got to see
1362960	1368160	uncle Billy and I got to see his wife, Kathy, and it was all just really nice. And Dan told
1368160	1371520	me I could pay for everybody. So that's the most I've ever paid for a meal. I'm just saying,
1371520	1377600	Oh, wow. Nice. Um, I learned something about me and my mother. I am truly her daughter.
1377600	1381120	When we went to the bar to order drinks, mom's like, I want an Amaretto and orange.
1381120	1385280	And I was like, I want an Amaretto sour. And mom's like, I've never had an Amaretto sour.
1385280	1388880	And I'm like, I've never had an Amaretto orange. So we switched drinks and actually really liked
1388880	1394640	them both. And I think this is just like some genetic taste thing that we like Amaretto and
1394640	1404160	citrusy things. So, cause we almost ordered exactly the same drink. Um, also never get an
1404160	1412800	Amaretto sour at Olive Garden. They are weak as fuck. Um, so, uh, Maggie had managed to get off
1412800	1419840	on Monday. So we spent, um, more of the time with her on Monday and then the rest of it was,
1420480	1428320	uh, me and Tiara left to our own devices. And then we, Tuesday, we drove back to Gulf port to
1428320	1434400	turn in the car and catch our flights home. Um, they had a problem with their, uh, flight coming
1434400	1440240	out and rearrange things in such a way that we had the same flight to Gulf port. Although, um,
1440240	1445520	I had upgraded my seats already to the comfort seats. So, you know, I, which I got, which was
1445520	1449760	great on the way back. Cause I, I had free Prosecco and I drink out of the bottle because
1449760	1457840	I'm a heathen. The picture is out there. Nice. But, um, you know, and actually I watched Twitch
1457840	1461840	streaming on my flight until we hit some turbulence and the internet got kind of wonky,
1461840	1467760	but I was on, I was watching people on Twitch. I was hanging out in a Le Pen stream for a little
1467760	1473520	bit and I think I was watching, um, yeah, I was watching Nick on the way over. I was like, Hey,
1473520	1478000	I'm in the air. Alan was doing the same thing as we were going down. I five, he was trying to
1478000	1481360	watch it would kind of go in and out, but he was trying to watch the Twitch streams. It's funny.
1481920	1486000	That's pretty funny, but I just thought it was funny doing it from the flight. And if I had been
1486000	1493280	on like, uh, my, my, uh, my Mac book, if, if I still had it, which I sold it, then, um, I,
1493840	1498640	it would have been, you know, really funny hike. Hi, I'm streaming from 35,000 feet,
1499280	1504960	but it wouldn't have been good enough for the way I do dead by daylight. Cause I'm a stadia player.
1505840	1514800	Um, but I mean, you know, it was, it was fun. It was, I had a great time, um, for the fun times
1514800	1523520	and, you know, we're really sad for the rest of it. And, uh, um, yeah, it was just, it was just
1523520	1528000	kind of weird being back because there was things that were familiar and things that weren't and I
1528640	1536160	kind of knew where I was. And it was just this weird sort of dichotomy of this is different.
1536160	1545040	This is exactly the same. Also a shout out to, uh, yellow hammer coffee, which is sort of like,
1545040	1548320	it's kind of like the same theory as our Dutch brothers. And they're really, really good,
1548320	1554240	but they're locally owned. Y'all are great. Yellow hammer coffee. If you were in Mobile,
1554240	1559600	Alabama, you need to go. Um, I was sad that I missed my friends. I was going to meet up with,
1559600	1566960	um, with empire, uh, another, uh, dead by daylight streamer. Um, and things just didn't work out.
1566960	1572800	Um, while I was downtown though, um, there was a barcade called game over. Apparently they closed
1572800	1576960	last year cause Tara and I were like, we're going to go and they were closed. They went out of
1576960	1582720	business. Um, but other, other than that, you know, it's a little farmer's market and did some
1582720	1588400	walking around and, you know, it was just, just kind of chill. Just kind of chill. Good. Good.
1589120	1593760	Yeah. All right. No gaming happened except for watching gamers.
1594960	1599680	So I guess I'll talk about my week a little bit. Um, so I also was on a trip, although a very
1599680	1604400	different sort of trip, Alan and I took a trip down to the LA area. Anybody from NorCal pretty
1604400	1608400	much calls everything south of the great vine LA. And that's really where we were all over
1608400	1614400	different places down there. And, um, uh, we went to Disney on the day that OLR would have
1614400	1619440	been. So Sunday, we went to Disneyland, um, which I hadn't been to in almost five years.
1619440	1624160	The last time Alan and I went was the year we got married. Um, so we hadn't been in a while. So,
1624160	1628640	um, it was nice. We got there pretty early. We got there like 15 minutes after opening
1628640	1632000	and we were by ourselves for a little bit cause the rest of our peeps weren't really meeting us
1632000	1637280	for a couple hours. Um, so we walked right on all the rides and wanted to do a DCA. So we got to do
1637280	1641440	like, you know, uh, the toy story midway mania, which is a game. So I played that
1641440	1645120	and got to see some of the other changes like in credit coaster. I hadn't been on that yet.
1645120	1650160	The guardians ride was good. Yeah. I liked in credit coaster. I was, I was totally fine with
1650160	1653200	the changes and the guardians ride was pretty good. I was ready to hate it because I love
1653200	1658480	tower terror, but they did a decent job with that. I liked it. Um, credit coaster was out when I went
1658480	1665040	after drag con 2019, but I went before galaxy's edge opened. Got it. Got it. Um, yeah. And so
1665040	1670160	we did get to cross over to Disney and then it got really crowded. Now I was with my pal Victoria,
1670160	1675280	who some of you might recognize from a show I've had off and on called shaking and crying.
1675280	1680560	And she is, you know, queen of Disney. And so she was able to get us, uh, on the queue. Cause it's
1680560	1685040	all through an app now. It's all a game in and of itself. She had to collect all our barcode numbers
1685040	1689280	and then you go on an app and that's how you get for rise of the resistance. So we did get to do
1689280	1694240	it. Um, she did a great job cause she, we only had to wait. Like I think she got in queue at noon. I
1694240	1698240	think it's the time to do it. And we got on that ride probably about two 30. So, uh, we didn't
1698240	1702480	have to wait too terribly long, all things considered. Um, so that was cool. And that's
1702480	1706560	like four rides in one. That was pretty amazing. So that was a neat ride. Um, so yeah, we had a
1706560	1711040	great Disney day, had a really good time. Um, around the trip, we got to do some other stuff
1711040	1716000	because Alan had never really spent time in Southern California outside of theme parks.
1716000	1719840	Um, we tried to meet up with kind of like you did. We tried to meet up with some Twitch streamers
1719840	1726000	while we were down there. Um, Nick, right. Yes. Yes. So I was going to say, um, you know, we,
1726000	1730480	we invited a few and, you know, people had other commitments or other things. I know it's always
1730480	1734320	weird too. And like people from the internet are like, hi, I know you from the internet. Do you
1734320	1737840	want to meet up? You know, and I totally get that, you know, it might be a little weird for some
1737840	1743440	people. It's fine, but it was nice that, um, we were able to make one of them work. So, um, Nick,
1743440	1747840	yeah, Nick and Prince, uh, who's a dead by daylight streamer. I'm sure we've rated in the
1747840	1752480	past long time ago before you were streaming Jamie and, uh, somebody I know you rate a lot
1752480	1758160	and I've rated too. Um, I was able to meet up with him. Uh, so we went, we met up in West Hollywood
1758160	1762960	at a cafe and just, just really just chatted, just talked about streaming a little bit and,
1762960	1767040	you know, dead by daylight and, you know, all the things you would expect, uh, some nerdy folks who
1767040	1772400	got together to talk about. So that was, that was really cool. I was nice to meet, um, a Twitch.
1772400	1778960	It was an interesting thing because, you know, having done OLR for nearly 20 years now,
1778960	1784080	it doesn't happen often, but it does happen where I meet people at conventions and stuff. And it's
1784080	1788720	kind of like, they're kind of like, it's so interesting to have watched you or mostly
1788720	1792960	listened to you for so many years. And I've never seen you for a long time before we had
1792960	1796720	the Twitch thing. It was like, I had no idea what you look like. It's interesting to see you and
1796720	1800160	just that whole, like, they're saying, you know, I've been listening to you for so long and now
1800160	1803280	I'm seeing you in person. It's always very flattering. Right. And all that, of course,
1803280	1807120	I don't take any of that for granted, but it was interesting. That was kind of the reverse scenario
1807120	1810880	where it was like, we were meeting Nick and I don't think Nick is super familiar with this
1810880	1813920	show. Like I know he knows you and I do it and stuff, but I don't expect he listens to it,
1813920	1817760	especially when he streams Sunday nights. Fans pop up in his chat though. But it was,
1817760	1822720	it was an interesting sort of reversal where it's like, Oh, I watched Nick a lot. Like,
1822720	1826560	you know, before I go to bed or something, you know, he's a late night streamer cause he's on
1826560	1830720	the West coast. I've watched many hours of him and now we're just hanging out in person. It was
1830720	1836800	a very interesting role reversal kind of thing. So it was, it was cool. Yeah. So, uh, but yeah,
1836800	1841280	I enjoyed it and I'm glad we got to hang out. So, um, I'm sure I'll be able to meet many more
1841280	1845920	Twitch streamers at TwitchCon next year. That's the goal anyway. Let's, let's make sure TwitchCon
1845920	1851040	happens and we're able to all hang out. So, but I mean, even with COVID and everything,
1851040	1855200	things are starting to come back. It's just precautions. You have to be back. Like, um,
1855200	1860000	I was able to host shows again this weekend. It was great. Um, and, uh, you know, we, but we had
1860000	1865840	mandatory vaccines and everybody still had to wear masks and I would hope by next fall, we're past
1865840	1870400	that, but we not might not be, but it's nice to know that TwitchCon could still happen with those.
1870400	1874640	So that would be, um, I really do want to do TwitchCon, Rob. I mean, I actually want to do
1874640	1882160	that more than DragonCon. Uh, well drag for me, DragonCon is really the big one every year, but,
1882160	1886480	um, I want to do about what, porque no los dos. That's, that's my perspective.
1886480	1888640	Because money and time off, just saying.
1888640	1894800	I get it. I get it. I get it. Uh, but I, I, I don't know. We'll see. We'll see what, uh,
1894800	1898480	ends up happening with TwitchCon and the ticket demand and all that stuff. So we'll see. Anyway,
1898480	1903760	um, as far as games that I played, yes, I did play a few games cause I streamed some Final Fantasy 14
1903760	1907440	in there somewhere. And I've still been playing that, trying to get all my characters to 80.
1907440	1912320	I'm still playing a little bit of Dead by Daylight. Um, and actually I did pick up a new
1912320	1918240	game this week. Um, so I want to talk a little bit about Pikmin Bloom because Pikmin Bloom just came
1918240	1923200	out really just a couple of days ago, I think on Thursday. And this is the latest game from Niantic,
1923200	1928320	who are the makers of Pokemon Go, Ingress. Uh, they chipped in with that Harry Potter
1928320	1934080	Wizards Unite game. Um, so this is kind of their latest offering and probably notable because it is,
1934080	1939680	uh, their only other offering with Nintendo next to Pokemon Go. So in a way it's kind of like the
1939680	1943600	sequel to Pokemon Go, I guess, or, but I shouldn't call it that cause it's a very different sort of
1943600	1950000	game. Um, so I really wasn't sure what to expect from Pikmin Bloom, but I have to admit, I find
1950000	1954560	that I'm into it more than I thought it would be because the weird thing is there isn't really
1954560	1960720	much of a game there or it doesn't seem to be, but it seems to be a really good like walking tracker
1960720	1966640	is what it really is. Um, and, uh, you know, interfaces with, um, Apple watch, Apple fitness,
1966640	1972240	as well as the Google equivalents to track the steps and where you're going. And, um,
1972240	1977680	as you're doing that, you start to ha very much uses the Pokemon Go eggs concept, which is how
1977680	1982480	you hatch new Pikmin. And then as you level up in the beginning, it seems like there's really
1982480	1986640	nothing, but as you level up more and more starts to unfold and you get to a point where you can
1986640	1991680	send the Pikmin off on expeditions to get fruit, which they bring back and you turn those into
1991680	1998560	petals and you use the petals to plant flowers. In the world, as you walk, when you turn it on,
1998560	2003200	see, I don't plant flowers at my house. I only plant because other people can see them.
2003200	2007760	So I only plant flower flowers at the park, but you turn that on and off, um, as you want to,
2007760	2012640	but I really think the most underrated feature of Pikmin Bloom is that it keeps like a journal
2012640	2017280	for you basically. And so at the end of the day, you'll get an alert about nine o'clock that says,
2017280	2021360	check out how your day went. And it'll track like, here's the steps that you got today.
2021360	2026720	Here's a random picture from your day. Tell me how you felt today. Make any notes that you want to
2026720	2031760	make about today. And, um, any postcards that you got from friends, because at some point the
2031760	2036240	Pikmin on the expeditions get postcards and you can send those to your friends. So like, I know
2036240	2040400	I sent one to Deft. I think I sent one to Deft. I'm pretty sure. Uh, and some other people that
2040400	2044720	are on my friends list as well. So, um, the only thing I think is a little weird is that you're
2044720	2048720	getting postcards from your friends who are all over the world, which is cool, but that doesn't
2048720	2054800	really then track the places you've been. So that's, um, a little bit interesting. Well,
2054800	2060960	then open your game Deft and send my Pikmin back by opening your postcard. No, it's all good. I
2060960	2065520	understand. Um, I was just reading a chat comment there where Deft said, I haven't opened Bloom
2065520	2072160	since Thursday. Um, is the game perfect? No, because, um, I still think I'm not sure what
2072160	2076880	the actual game is. I think there's still probably more to it as you go on. Um, the
2076880	2080800	microtransactions make no sense at all. I would never pay for any of that stuff that they're
2080800	2086560	offering. Um, and quite simply, honestly, if it's a free walking log and walking tracker,
2086560	2093040	I don't see the need to do that stuff. There's no competition. There's no scoreboard. There's no
2093040	2098320	territory control game. There's, there's no incentive to be competitive and to get
2098320	2103040	the competitive edge by buying the microtransaction stuff, which quite frankly, the number of coins
2103040	2108960	that you earn is laughable. If you think Pokemon go is bad, the number of coins you earn in Pikmin,
2108960	2112480	at least so far, we should remember it's the first release, but the number of coins you earn
2112480	2118080	in Pikmin Bloom is laughable. To put it in perspective, you get one coin when you plant
2118080	2125040	500 flowers. And that's not cumulative. You have to do it in one walk. Um, five, 500 flowers is
2125040	2131840	about the equivalent of one mile. I found you get one coin for planting flowers for one mile.
2132960	2137120	So think about that a little bit. I, so far, I think I've been doing a lot of walking.
2137120	2143680	The game has been incentivizing my walking a little bit. I'm up to six coins earned. Yay.
2143840	2149520	Yay. Exactly. I don't know what I'm going to buy with that. Not much. So I, I think there's still
2149520	2154320	a lot to work out with the microtransactions and why, why I would ever get those. Um, but I don't
2154320	2157120	know, maybe next week after I've played the game a little more, I'll have an answer for that.
2157120	2161600	Although I will say I'm up to like level 11, which is, you know, in just a few days, I,
2162240	2165760	I think I've done pretty good, but there are people on my friends list that are higher because
2165760	2172480	of course, of course I'm friends with a lot of other very hardcore geolocation game players.
2172480	2177280	And I've, I've talked about that on the show before, how I usually am going to check out
2177280	2182320	any AR geolocation game. And of course, Niantic is the cream of the crop,
2182320	2187200	despite how you feel about Pokemon Go or their other offerings. The reality is
2188240	2193680	other companies really aren't making those same type of games. Draconius Go ain't it.
2193680	2199600	Garfield Go really ain't it. So, you know, Niantic is, is on the leading edge of that stuff.
2199600	2204960	So anyway, I do recommend Pikmin Bloom so far as just a walking, you know, track your walking,
2204960	2209600	nice little journal type of thing, just a cute little way to incentivize your walks.
2209600	2215600	But I would say don't expect much more than what it is. And to be fair, I believe Nintendo and
2215600	2222880	Niantic have really said from the beginning, this is going to be a little bit less of a intense
2222880	2227840	game. This really is something that's kind of meant to encourage exploration and walking.
2227840	2233760	And I will say if that is the goal, they are, they are, it does encourage exploration and walking.
2233760	2241120	So I'll give it that. So, all right. SSU 100 Matt in chat says, I have a billion things tracking
2241120	2245840	my steps, so I'm good. While I'm not a Pikmin fan, I will give it a download. It really,
2246720	2251360	I'm not much of a Pikmin fan either. And I don't really see how it connects to the games at all,
2251360	2256560	except for the fact that they go off together to get fruit and they bring it back like that
2256560	2260080	is incorporated in a game, but it's not the same way that the actual Pikmin games work.
2260640	2264720	So I've never actually played a Pikmin game. It's very, well, and Pokemon Go
2265520	2269440	really isn't like the mainline Pokemon games really at all. You know, there's, there's,
2269440	2274400	I mean, the characters are the same, but that's about it. So it's interesting. Anyway,
2274960	2278880	so there you go. I did at least get to play one new game this week to talk to you guys about.
2278880	2284000	So there you go. My gaming week. All right. With that, I think we'll get into some gaming news.
2284000	2288560	Sound good, DarkSaga? I actually have a very offbeat question, Rob.
2288560	2293040	Go for it. Do you ever get people text you and they sign their texts?
2294240	2296560	Like they actually like put... Like it's a letter?
2297600	2301600	Love Rob or something at the end? Yeah. Something like that.
2302880	2306960	I have seen people sign their texts. That's ridiculous.
2306960	2313120	I see it more with work. And I don't know why that is, but usually it's coworkers I see it with.
2313120	2317280	With older people. Maybe it's a generation thing. I don't know. Maybe they think they
2317280	2321520	are writing letters. I don't know. But maybe they should also realize that we
2321520	2324640	know who they are and they don't need to sign a text.
2325520	2329120	Orin tried in chat says people just want to be formal and maybe it's that.
2329120	2332880	Well, screw that. All right.
2332880	2338480	That's just so, I mean, signing a work email is, is actually legitimate work etiquette.
2338480	2342080	Right. In a work email, the etiquette is
2343120	2351840	dear so-and-so or just so-and-so's name, body of text, sincerely or thank you or whatever so-and-so.
2351840	2354640	I've written emails. And that's in our style guide at my work.
2354640	2358480	That's fine. Because I've written emails to my team that go, hi, comma,
2358480	2361840	today can we, whatever is going on. I do this too.
2362400	2369200	If it's my team, I might be like sup team or hey team, but it always follows typical
2369200	2373200	letter structure because an email is closer to a written letter than it is to a text.
2373200	2374800	Right. Yeah, I get that. I get that.
2374800	2380560	It's just, it's like, it just is hit me because a couple of the sisters do it. And I'm just like,
2380560	2384960	top, I know it's you. We all know it's you. Everyone knows it's you.
2385520	2388240	Oh, is it like a group text thing? Is that why they're doing it?
2388240	2391280	It happened once in a group text, but there are people who do it one-on-one.
2392800	2397200	And I'm like, no, I know who you are. I know who you are.
2397200	2399120	Do you know who you are? Are you reminding yourself?
2400640	2405920	All right. Let's get into some gaming news. Love Rob. All right. Let's talk about the
2405920	2410320	PlayStation State of Play event that happened this week where they, you know, PlayStation did
2410320	2414640	their own kind of Nintendo Direct style thing where they showed some updates on news, but it
2414640	2418400	was a lot of third party stuff and not, I don't think there's really anything from here that was
2418400	2422320	like a huge, like no new Final Fantasy 16 trailer or anything like that. All right.
2422880	2427600	It was some more smaller and indie games, but that doesn't mean they're bad because there's
2427600	2432480	some really good stuff. For example, one of the games they were showing off was a game called
2432480	2439120	We Are OFK, which I think, correct me if I'm wrong chat, but isn't this the same group that
2439120	2443440	did Sayonara Wild Hearts that's putting this game together? Because if so, I'll play it just based
2443440	2451120	on that alone. It is a game that follows the pop band OFK and they are trying to navigate love,
2451120	2457200	friends, music, and so forth in their home setting of LA. And it's kind of a story centered game,
2457200	2462720	but also with kind of music involved there. So that is something that was featured in the
2465280	2470240	PlayStation State of Play event. And I think they released, or they mentioned the release for that
2470240	2477120	as well, just 2022. I don't think we saw anything beyond that. And Def says, as far as is it the
2477120	2482720	same people? I think it is. I'm not sure though. Some other games that were shown, Deathverse was
2482720	2487920	announced for the PlayStation 4 and 5. This is a follow-up to the free-to-play title, Let It Die.
2489040	2494800	Probably one of the two big things that was shown, Bugsnax, the Isle of Bugsnax,
2495680	2503520	excuse me, the Isle of Big Snax. It's hard to get straight there, but it's Bugsnax and Big Snax.
2503520	2509360	So it's kind of like a DLC, a big expansion for Bugsnax that's coming soon. A lot of people
2509360	2514000	excited to hear about a new Star Ocean. So if you're an RPG fan, that was probably a highlight
2514000	2520480	for you is that Star Ocean, The Divine Force is coming out in 2022. Darsaka, this might be up your
2520480	2525280	alley. King of Fighters 15. I don't know if you still follow that franchise, but King of Fighters
2526720	2532080	15 is coming for the PlayStation 4 and 5. And there's going to be an open beta test
2532080	2536880	from November 19th to the 22nd. And a new character was shown off. She looks pretty cool
2536880	2542640	called Dolores is her name. So you can check that out. And then one more game that was shown,
2542640	2549840	Little Devil Inside was shown with a new trailer. And honestly that was about it. But looking in
2549840	2554320	chat there, Quest Buster says the Star Ocean announcement was a big surprise. Yeah, I kind
2554320	2557120	of think that was the highlight for a lot of people, but I also know a lot of people that
2557120	2562880	really love their RPG games. Def says King of Fighters 15 looks amazing. Yeah. I mean,
2562880	2566400	I check it out, especially if there's going to be an open beta. We can kind of play for free.
2566400	2573680	I'd love to check it out. Oh, Def points out too in our chat that the open beta is the same weekend
2573680	2581600	as Pokemon Diamond and Pearl remakes are released. So yeah, well, November is always a busy month
2581600	2586640	and November literally starts tomorrow. And so the next few weeks are going to be, you know,
2586640	2592800	the big holiday releases are all for the next few weeks as we lead up to Black Friday and those
2592800	2596240	sales, you know, even with the pandemic and everything going on, it's still in the chip
2596240	2602320	shortages around the world still in the freight shortages in the harbor and all that stuff.
2603760	2609440	It still doesn't stop the holiday shopping spree. Yep. Def says Final Fantasy 14's expansion is that
2609440	2614000	same weekend. Yep. It's going to be a busy, busy time for me because, you know, you know,
2614000	2619280	I love me some Final Fantasy 14 and I will be checking out the latest expansion and Walker.
2619280	2624320	That's for sure. Anyway, so that is what you missed at State of Play or what you saw at
2624320	2629280	State of Play, depending on if you watched it or not. Let's go to Dark Sakura, I think has
2629280	2637440	other PlayStation news, right? I do. So they have formed a new label specifically for PC gaming.
2639520	2648080	In fact, some Steam users might've noticed that there were PC releases that switched from
2648080	2655200	PlayStation mobile to PlayStation PC LLC. And according to a corporation Wiki listing,
2656080	2662560	Sony Interactive Entertainment registered PlayStation PC in April this year from its
2662560	2669120	California headquarters. It's a bit more of a formality on there, but it's for doing,
2669120	2676640	for how they're releasing their PC ports, including so far Horizon Zero Dawn and Days Gone.
2676640	2686160	Mm-hmm. Looking also, it seems like they're also going to be doing Uncharted 4 and Uncharted Lost
2686160	2695680	Legacy and God of War is going to have a PC port as well. Sackboy, A Big Adventure may also be
2695680	2703280	coming to PC according to Steam's database and that they are still working on bringing out more
2703280	2713680	titles as they evaluate it. So I guess this is official. Yeah. And some people feel some sort
2713680	2718240	of way about the fact that these Sony exclusive games are now coming out for PC. So they're a
2718240	2722640	little less exclusive, but I don't know why people get really hung up on that. Number one,
2723280	2727760	none of these games have released same day and date. It's not like how Microsoft does it.
2728640	2732480	God of War, I think that was actually one of the announcements from the week we were gone as well.
2732480	2739040	That game is coming out January of 2022. That's years after the game first came out. We're not
2739040	2743280	talking about Ragnarok. We're talking about the reboot God of War game that came out some time
2743280	2749600	ago. So it's been years, even Days Gone was at least a year. A lot of these games are taking
2749600	2755680	their sweet time and coming to PC. So I don't think Sony fans should get too bent out of shape
2755680	2761360	about it. Plus the other thing to remember is that games that release on the PlayStation 5,
2761360	2766640	they are optimized for the PlayStation 5. When you take them to a PC, they're going to play
2766640	2772320	differently depending on the PC. Yes, some will run better. Probably not, unless you have a really
2772320	2776320	high end machine and you've been able to get one of those really uber graphics cards. You'll
2776320	2779760	probably get PlayStation 4 quality, but you're going to have to have a real, which some of you
2779760	2784640	do have a top of the line PC, I'm sure. And you will get PlayStation 5 quality out of your games,
2784640	2790880	but most people probably won't. So you'll still kind of get that better experience on PlayStation
2790880	2796000	5, unless you've really made an investment in your PC. Now, of course, PC games means
2796000	2802480	mods. That's exciting for a lot of people, but I think we also have to realize while, you know,
2802480	2808080	you and I that listen to the show, we might enjoy the occasional mod. Most people don't bother with
2808080	2814720	mods. So it's kind of a non-factor when it comes to, you know, releasing games on PC and so forth.
2814800	2824080	So, but you know what? I'm also, I can see where Sony, it is strategically smart for them to put
2824080	2829600	out something like God of War on PC to get more people into that series. And the other thing to
2829600	2835680	keep in mind about Steam, which is huge versus Sony's other reach is that Steam is in way more
2835680	2842400	countries than PlayStation officially is otherwise. So being able to play the games on PC may be the
2842400	2848240	only way in some countries for people to, I suppose, legally or affordably would probably
2848240	2854560	be the better word, play these games and something to consider as well. So Quest Buster in chat says,
2854560	2858720	can't wait for the God of War mod that turns Baldur into Thomas the Tank Engine. Yes. You,
2858720	2863920	you know, it's a nudie mods, topless mods, all of it, all of it will happen. It's always going
2863920	2871520	to happen. Of course, Thomas and Randy, the Macho Man Savage mod. Absolutely. Or should I say,
2871520	2884320	yeah. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. All right. Um, moving on. Moving on. Let's talk about the latest in
2884320	2890080	Blizzard, which, um, you know, I've been saying on this show, fuck sake. I've been saying on
2890080	2895680	the show for weeks and weeks that, um, it has been X number of days since the letter from the ABK
2895680	2902880	employees has gone unresponded to. It should be noted that this week, most of it was addressed.
2902880	2907200	Um, you know, Bobby Kotick did put out another statement where, you know, he was like, oh,
2907200	2911040	I'm going to take a salary cut, although he's certainly not losing any of his investments.
2911040	2916240	So is he really taking a salary cut? However, him taking a salary cut, I don't think was in
2916240	2922880	the letter. What was in the letter were things like, um, ending arbitration for some of these,
2923680	2929120	types of disagreements that was finally agreed to. They will end forced arbitration for that.
2929120	2933680	Um, a commitment to diversity in hiring to get, um, and I forget the exact percentage. I'm sorry
2933680	2938800	guys, but something about a certain percentage of women, non-binary, you know, folks in the
2938800	2944560	workplace as well. Um, so Activision did make some more of those commitments. Um, you know,
2944560	2950320	you can, they didn't, they didn't do everything in the letter. Um, but you know, if you look at the,
2950640	2956240	ABK employee, you know, effort, Twitter, a better ABK, the Twitter account, they do, they do,
2956240	2960800	they did say today was a victory for us, but there's still more to do. Of course, this is,
2960800	2963600	this is something that's just going to magically disappear because, you know,
2963600	2969120	Activision agreed to some of the demands. It is ongoing, but it is, it is nice that finally
2969760	2976240	we have some resolution and there are, you know, um, for example, uh, I, there is still not a
2976880	2981840	unbiased company audit going in because the company that's doing the audit is what remembers
2981840	2985920	has, is tied to all those union busting, busting things. Talked about that on the show before.
2985920	2990960	Um, it's, it's, they're still involved with that. And so the employees do not consider that a win.
2990960	2994400	So there are still things that they are fighting for. Um, and I think that's important to point
2994400	3003520	out. So, um, now amongst all of this, a pretty huge headline this week out of blizzard, um,
3003520	3009440	BlizzCon line was scheduled to happen in early 2022, just like they did this year,
3009440	3016480	the virtual BlizzCon event in 2021. However, this week that event was canceled. There is not going
3016480	3022800	to be a BlizzCon 2022, and that is kind of a shocker, um, for, you know, uh, well, well,
3022800	3028400	I don't, is it a shocker? Maybe it's not. I kind of think it is. Um, but at the same time, I also
3028400	3034560	get that blizzard has a lot of polarizing things going on. Now, if you think about the last time
3034560	3039680	they had a BlizzCon in person, they had those protests going on outside. Remember? Because
3039680	3045680	that was right around the time that, um, they had banned the e-sports guy for saying free Hong Kong.
3045680	3050880	Remember all that stuff that was, that was leading into BlizzCon 2019. So now, not that
3050880	3055200	I'm saying they closed out of fear of protests or anything like that, but obviously with everything
3055200	3061280	going on, I think there was probably some concern about was, was it going to be as well received of
3061280	3068800	an event? Um, and I think it's also important to consider that Blizzard's been losing a lot of their
3068800	3078560	hardcore fans, um, from this news, from the, uh, I'll just, I'm sorry to say it this way, but I'm
3078560	3082880	just going to be candid. The failure of the World of Warcraft expansion. I don't know how else to
3082880	3087760	phrase it, but the World of Warcraft expansion went over like a poop. Like it's not winning
3087760	3093840	people over. People are going to new world, final fantasy 14, or just playing something else. World
3093840	3101200	of Warcraft is hemorrhaging players. And that was like the core audience of BlizzCon. And so you add
3101200	3106480	this, that into that. It's a danger. And here's the other thing to consider. And maybe Blizzard
3106480	3111040	had to consider this as well. What are they going to announce in early 2022?
3114240	3118960	What do they have to show? I hope not because I have friends that work there and I want to make
3118960	3125040	sure that they're still taken care of, but, um, I think the reality is Blizzard probably doesn't
3125040	3132160	have much to show. They might have an update on Diablo four. Um, they, I have a feeling
3133120	3137520	they're taking a real good look at World of Warcraft right now. And maybe I think we were
3137520	3142880	all expecting that a World of Warcraft expansion would be announced. Maybe they're going to push
3142880	3146880	that back a little bit because they have to take a good fucking hard look at that game right now and
3146880	3152400	where it's at. Because exactly whatever they do with the next expansion is likely their last
3152400	3159120	chance to salvage that game. So they're probably having to have a real long conversation about
3159120	3162880	that whole thing. Um, and the other thing to consider is that, you know, when it comes to
3162880	3168320	Blizzcon stuff, Blizzard could put out a press release tomorrow that says, Hey, StarCraft three
3168320	3172640	is coming in 2022 and everybody would be talking about it. Everybody would cover it. You know,
3172640	3177600	maybe that they've reached that point of Nintendo or Sony state of play or what have you, where it's
3177600	3181040	just like, you know what, we're just going to announce the news. We don't need to have this.
3181040	3185920	We don't need to have Metallica perform with the news, especially in an online only environment
3185920	3189360	when we're not still doing conventions. What if Metallica sang the news?
3190720	3193600	I'd be there for that. I'd be, I would totally be there for that.
3194160	3198560	I should point out Blizzard did note in the cancellation notice, uh, they're going to take
3198560	3203280	time to reimagine Blizzcon saying whatever the event looks like in the future, we would also
3203280	3209440	need to ensure that it feels as safe, welcoming and inclusive as possible. You might remember
3210080	3215680	some of that, uh, discussion about Blizzard was about the behavior of some of the employees at
3215680	3220800	Blizzcon and some of the things they were saying about cosplay entrance behind their back. And I
3220800	3230160	hate to say it, but the Cosby suite, which we all know was a problem. So that all also plays into
3230160	3236320	what they really have to look at with Blizz, Blizzcon and all of that. So I don't, I, so I,
3236320	3242640	I don't know. Like I'm kind of like, it is a bummer to see, I think when you really put your
3242640	3248080	brain to it, it makes sense why they're doing it. And maybe they just need to back burner it
3248080	3252400	until we're talking about coming. Here's the interesting thing. If Blizzcon, they wanted
3252400	3257520	to do it in person, they probably could. With precautions, of course, vaccinations,
3257520	3261680	mass not stuff, especially when we're talking about early next year, they probably could do
3261680	3266480	an in-person event if they wanted. But I understand why that's a lot of money. They're not wanting to
3266480	3270560	pony up right now with everything else going on. And maybe they just want to take a back seat
3270560	3275760	and see how drip feeding the information goes a little bit. And I think Blizzard has to ask
3275760	3281680	themselves the really hard question. How do we win our community back? Yeah.
3283280	3286400	I'm not even sure. It's going to take a lot. I really think it's going to take a lot. It's
3286400	3291840	going to take a lot. I'm not sure I have an easy answer for that. You know, um, listening,
3291840	3297280	listening to the employee demands, it's a start, but I think we also have to kind of see the
3297280	3303280	actions behind that, of course. And again, you know, with World of Warcraft, which was really
3303280	3308400	a community building game for them, with that really not taking off this last expansion,
3309600	3312560	they have to seriously reevaluate World of Warcraft. And I think.
3314320	3320880	I think there's a very good possibility the next direction may be a World of Warcraft two
3320880	3326720	or just a Warcraft four and taking that franchise in a completely new direction.
3327520	3332320	Um, but I don't know, but again, Blizzard takes so long to make games, which I understand,
3332320	3336560	you know, a good game takes a long time. But even if Blizzard were to think, okay,
3336560	3341040	we're going to start Warcraft four, we need to do a Warcraft four. Even if they like came out today
3341040	3347280	and said Warcraft four is happening, that game would not be out until 2026. Yeah. Let's be real.
3347280	3353600	Let's be real. Remember the Blizzcon? They got absolutely shit on destroyed for that Diablo three
3353600	3360800	mobile phone game. Don't you all have phones? That was Blizzcon 2018, right? Somebody in chat,
3360800	3368320	correct me if I'm wrong. Wasn't the mobile phone Diablo 2018. That game is still not out.
3371120	3376400	It's Blizzard takes. I almost feel like this is the thing Blizzard has to work on.
3377600	3382480	And it's such a weird thing to say, because I know that a good game takes time. It takes a
3382480	3388080	lot of work. Blizzard has to get faster at this. They, they, they, they cannot afford to be slow
3388080	3393440	right now. And I it's, it's, it's a shitty situation. I completely will say here and say
3393440	3398720	it's, it's a no win situation for them, but they have to put out something good and they have to
3398720	3408080	do it soon. If Diablo four is bad, I really fear for the future. And that's going to be very sad.
3409040	3413600	Anyway. All right, let's move on. Dark Sakura. How about a money story?
3414800	3418080	Well, it makes me want to go through my own collection officially now.
3419360	3426960	But there's another issue of a sealed Nintendo property that has gone for some money. This is
3426960	3432800	a copy of Super Mario Brothers two, known in Japan as Super Mario USA, which was also originally
3432880	3443120	doki-doki panic. And it sold its near mint inbox, everything. It was part of a, a estate sale
3443920	3451520	in Floyd's knobs, Indiana, and it sold for $88,000. So.
3452720	3458240	Now this wasn't related to all that other, like, remember that hour long YouTube expose
3458240	3462160	on the auctions and the game. This isn't related to that, right? I mean, I guess.
3462800	3466960	It was only $88,000 and not several million. So yes. Yeah.
3466960	3468080	Only $88,000.
3470400	3476080	So, um, pod culture says, Holy crap. That's right near me. Yeah. Small world, small world.
3476080	3480000	So, so dark soccer, you think you might have some, do you think you have anything
3480000	3486000	unopened in the vault? Oh, I know I do. Oh, wow. Okay. That could be interesting.
3486800	3496400	It's, um, we have a few more, like more some peace, some, uh, uh, like PS one or PS two,
3496400	3500880	like my copy of guitar room man was sealed for a long time. Cause I had a couple of them.
3501840	3508000	Um, none of my Ness or SNES stuff is, but I do have a couple of really good copies
3508000	3514160	with the box of like mighty final fight. Um, which goes for a decent bit. Now, um,
3514160	3518560	I have final fight guy in the box. It's not the original box, but I have the box and in certain
3518560	3526960	manual for a final fight guy. Um, I have Ninja Gaiden trilogy in the box, um, which goes for
3526960	3530960	a bit, a pretty penny. Um, if anyone wants to make me offers on these, by the way,
3530960	3535440	make me offers, cause we'll probably sell them now. We need to make some room and
3535440	3539600	I have things I want to buy. I think the only thing I have still see,
3539600	3543520	I have a sealed copy of like DDR X two or something like that with a dance mat.
3545040	3549200	In the studio for whatever random re I think, I don't know. I think I got, it was a promo or
3549200	3554640	something, but yeah, it's just funny. Remember when, remember what was that place called
3554640	3561280	that was like, um, on North gate by where I used to work. And it was like one of those
3561280	3566400	big warehouse stores, not like a big lots, but, but like a resale place. Oh yeah, yeah,
3566400	3570640	yeah. I know what you're talking about, but it's, it's, it's like a big lots. Yeah. And Dan and I
3570720	3576320	bought every single last copy of the first U S release of dance, dance revolution with the pad
3576320	3579920	so that we could sell them to our friends who were having trouble buying them. Yeah. Yeah.
3580560	3583360	And we got them dirt cheap and they were still fairly new.
3584960	3592320	And yeah, I, I remember that craziness, but we should have a note, see if it's worth anything.
3592320	3595600	I mean, shit, have an open, have an opening party. If it's not, you never know.
3596160	3599920	All right. Um, let's move on and talk about one of my least favorite companies in the world.
3599920	3604800	Probably my least favorite company in the world. Uh, Facebook, Facebook had a big, uh, event of
3604800	3610320	their own this week and they announced the big rebranding. So Facebook as the top level
3610320	3614880	organization is now going to be called Metta. And I think a lot of you guys heard about this
3614880	3620240	new name. So their new name is Metta. Um, which, um, I think they should apologize to Metta world
3620240	3624720	peace, who is the only person allowed to use that name. However, that's what they're going with.
3624720	3628720	So Metta is to Facebook. What kind of like alphabet is to Google in a way. So basically
3628720	3634240	like Metta is going to be the parent organization that, you know, Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp,
3634240	3640160	um, and all this, uh, Oculus basically are all going to roll up as separate companies under
3640160	3643840	Metta. So they're trying to create this illusion that they are separating the companies. Cause you
3643840	3648080	know, there's all this call for like breakup Facebook and all this stuff. Well, they're just
3648080	3654080	kind of throwing it all under this, uh, umbrella of Metta. Um, however, the one good news out of
3654080	3659760	this is with all of this change, uh, one of the Oculus quests, most, uh, controversial features
3659760	3664000	is going to be going away. Um, I'm not talking about the name, although that is apparently
3664000	3668160	changing too. The Oculus quest will now be the meta quest apparently is going to be a thing.
3668720	3673920	However, you're no longer going to need a Facebook account to use them. And that was one of the big
3673920	3678480	sticking points for a lot of people. I know, uh, our own Bobby Black Wolf here at VOG network,
3678480	3686480	who is a VR guru of many sorts. He would not get the new Oculus headsets because you had to have
3686480	3691600	a Facebook login to get in them. And it was really stupid because if you got banned on Facebook,
3691600	3696800	which we know it's really easy to end up in Facebook jail these days, you can, you can ask
3696800	3703840	certain friend of ours that are there that are Facebook jail frequent flyers. Okay. That if you
3703840	3708080	got banned from Facebook, you would basically get banned from Oculus and lose access to all of your
3708080	3713920	games, which is the stupidest thing I think I've ever heard. So, um, you know, cause people can
3713920	3720640	also get banned over their names. So what if you are somebody like me who uses a fake name
3720640	3726640	everywhere online, because you've had stalkers in the past that you do not want finding you online,
3726640	3732560	but Facebook feels the need to play God and make people go by their real names. Let's say I get
3732560	3737760	banned from Facebook because I refuse to use my real name. Then, then what I would lose all these
3737760	3743760	games and stuff, which is stupid. So thankfully the stupid rule is going to be changing and now
3743760	3748800	they will be. So apparently if you are a dick bag on the Oculus service, you could still lose
3748800	3752960	access to everything. However, that's a little more in line with steam and other shops. And I
3752960	3760400	get that that's fine. So I just don't think it should have been tied to Facebook. So, um, CTO
3760400	3767360	Andrew Boz Bozworth, uh, said we're working on new ways to log into quests that won't require
3767360	3773120	a Facebook account landing sometime next year. This is one of our highest priority areas of work
3773120	3779600	internally. So that's nice, I guess. Um, anyway, they, I just hope that they're changing cause
3779600	3784400	they knew how harmful their platform was and did jack shit about it. Cause they were making money.
3786400	3791360	Nothing is going to get me to go back to using that. And I only still have my messenger because
3791920	3796320	I have need for it. That's it. I said, well, messengers practically replaced email now,
3796320	3800320	which sucks. I don't like it, but it is what it is. You know, some of my conversations have
3800320	3804960	moved to signal though, which is nice, but there's still a signal because here's the reality. Here's
3804960	3810080	the reality. You guys all know I do these hosting gigs and stuff like that. All of those gigs that
3810080	3814800	I book are through Facebook messenger. If I stop using messenger, people are not going to offer
3814800	3817920	me gigs because they're not going to know how to get ahold of me because that is just the sad
3817920	3824400	reality of how the firm grip that Facebook as well as messenger and all that have on this society.
3824400	3828080	I mean, we talked about this. We talked about this a few weeks ago with the shutdown when,
3828080	3832160	you know, people were saying, don't joke about that because in other countries, WhatsApp is
3832160	3837520	their primary form of communication to which I'm sitting here going. It is absolutely valid to then
3837520	3846080	ask the question, why are they relying on WhatsApp? Don't tell me what I can and can't criticize.
3846720	3855280	Fuck you. Criticism is essential by the way, to any sort of change. Yes. And if something isn't good,
3856000	3861120	especially if it's something that you enjoy or love, you must always be critical of the
3861120	3866080	things that you love instead of taking them at face value. Absolutely. Absolutely. Absolutely.
3866080	3870560	And that is, that is everything, you know, cause over the years, over the years, I've can't tell
3870560	3875440	you how many times I've heard, do you guys hate Nintendo? You guys are so critical of Nintendo,
3875440	3878160	especially Loki, always yells at Nintendo and all this stuff. And I'm like,
3879840	3883520	we're critical cause we love them. And I've used the top model story a hundred times. I
3883520	3888560	need a new analogy, but the reality, we are critical because we love them and we don't
3888560	3893040	understand some of these decisions. Sometimes we feel like it hinders their success. But then
3893040	3899200	again, look at the family plan. I thought, sorry, not the family plan, the expansion pack for
3899200	3904320	Nintendo online. I thought for sure, Oh, this is going to, this is going to be a big poop.
3904320	3908880	This is going to land like a thud. Nobody's going to get everybody's fucking getting it.
3909520	3913360	Everybody's fucking getting it because either they're on a family plan where one person wants
3913360	3917360	it, which I think is what happened to you, dark Sakura, or, um, people just have a moment of
3917360	3920880	weakness or whatever. They're like, Oh, I'll get it just to check it out. So this thing is going
3920880	3925680	to be a huge success for Nintendo. And it's just going to encourage them to make more questionable
3925680	3933040	value offerings in the future. Anyway, uh, go ahead. Some comments in chat, tiger con chat
3933040	3936720	says we're critical of Nintendo because they're going against the grain and not following what
3936720	3941520	everyone else is doing. But see, sometimes that can end up being a good thing. Like the Nintendo
3941520	3945920	directs and them stopping the traditional E3. You know what? That worked out real well for them.
3946560	3950160	The their wacky approach to hardware and what they did with the switch
3950880	3954160	is very different from what anyone else is doing and look how well it's worked out for them.
3954240	3957920	So sometimes they go against the grain. It's a really good thing. And I will still die on
3957920	3964640	the Hill that Nintendo is the best game maker in the business period. Nintendo just has this unique
3964640	3969680	position of creating their own hardware as the only place to play those games.
3971520	3976800	And some of the decisions that go along with that. Anyway, as Joe and Hunter Matt also points out,
3976800	3980640	the show has been critical of each major console maker at one point or another.
3980720	3986240	Folks weren't here during the PS3 era when we play show tunes when Sony put out ridiculous news
3986240	3992480	during that time. Absolutely. And Don Matrick announcing the Xbox one. Holy shit was that
3992480	3998240	year's worth of content. So we were critical of everybody when they deserve it. It's because we
3998240	4003120	love video games and we want to see the gaming companies do better. Well, see, that's the thing.
4003120	4010000	And I'm going to just go a little bit tangential on this. Sure. There are people who, when you're
4010000	4015520	critical about something, they're going to say, they're going to, you know, say, why are you a
4015520	4021280	hater? Blah, blah, blah. And women get this a lot when we try to bring up things that are done
4021280	4026880	against us. Oh, well, why do you hate men? Uh, no, I'm critical. That's, that's the difference
4026880	4032720	being critical. Just because somebody has a difference of opinion or says something
4032720	4039440	criticizing something else does not make them a hater. It makes them an intelligent human being
4039440	4044720	that understands the difference between being a hater and being critical is someone who's taking
4044720	4049600	and there's a difference also between like being a hater is just like, oh, well, I don't like Android.
4049600	4054800	I don't know why I just don't because they're, they're not my iPhone. You know, people like that,
4054800	4062640	that's hater. That's stupid. But when you're like, you know what, I have to say that I don't like
4062640	4067360	this, this and this feature on this device. And I think it could be improved on and made better.
4067920	4077600	You're not hating on it. You are being critical. Criticism and insulting or being just overtly
4077600	4084080	negative are two different things. They can sometimes sound alike, especially if there is
4084080	4089840	such a thing as being overly critical. Um, I prefer tactical, tactical criticism. And I know
4089840	4095680	we have bordered a little bit sometimes cause we do feel so strongly about these things, but
4096640	4102720	just because somebody has a difference of opinion than you and just because someone criticizes
4102720	4110800	something does not give you the right to tell them not to. Everybody around us has the right
4110800	4118960	to say whatever the goddamn fuck we want. End of story. That said, yes, there are consequences.
4118960	4123520	If someone wants to go out and be a racist piece of shit, well, if they get ostracized for it,
4123520	4130160	that's on them because they chose to say those words. But no one can tell another person what
4130160	4137200	to say and what not to say. We can only create the social contract that outlines what is generally
4137200	4145840	acceptable and what is not. If someone says, well, you can't say this about this group of people,
4146560	4152080	what they're telling you is that it's not socially acceptable to say those things because
4152080	4159360	they are hurtful. They will portray you as this or only people of this certain mindset would think
4159360	4166000	something like this. Um, typically you, if you give someone correction, critical correction,
4167040	4171440	then they'll be like, Oh, okay. If they're truly a good person, want to try to do better.
4171440	4176960	And then there's those assholes who will take it as a personal insult, right? Right. It's all
4177680	4184800	going back to criticism, going back to, uh, I'm a tactful isn't the quiet word that I'm looking
4184800	4189920	for, although being tactful is certainly better, but it goes back to an understanding of the
4189920	4196960	difference of knowing what's appropriate. Um, I have to get you a comment from Tiger
4196960	4202160	Claw in chat that I think is, is really right on, honestly, Tiger Claw on chat says you find
4202160	4207760	most haters on YouTube and they do it just because they can. And while I agree with Deft,
4207760	4211440	I agree with Deft who follows it up and says, you can find haters everywhere, even IRL. While
4211440	4216000	I do agree with that, there's something about YouTube and that culture that really
4216000	4223440	fosters that kind of hateful hater video and, uh, uh, culture and, and, and dark soccer,
4223440	4229680	you just said it, it's all about the clicks and this goes back to why Facebook is bad
4230640	4237680	because they exploit these things and the, the, the adrenaline rush that comes with hate,
4238400	4245840	they exploit that for clicks. Why do you think it's always these shitty political debates and
4245840	4254240	things that come up on Facebook? It's, it's all hate. And then yeah, these videos on YouTube
4254240	4259360	are really bad, you know, and it's, it's in gaming, it's in everywhere you look, but like,
4259360	4264560	you know, especially gaming, there's so many channels out there that are just hateful when
4264560	4270000	it comes to games. And that's why, that's why, and I've said, folks, I've said this for years.
4271120	4275680	If you're going to start a podcast, I always urge people, what's your theme? What's your brand?
4275680	4280560	What is it? Describe your show in one sentence. What's the tagline on the movie poster? If your
4280560	4286560	tagline is, oh, me and three of my friends, uh, sit around and talk shit about video games,
4286560	4292960	do not do that podcast. Stop. Maybe, maybe podcasting isn't for you actually until you
4292960	4300000	really reevaluate what it is you want to do, because I'm not going to download a fan podcast,
4300000	4308160	a fandom podcast, just hear someone talk shit all day. Yeah. And there are some podcasts and
4308400	4315360	why, why not? There's some long running podcasts that I feel live in this world of we're just here
4315360	4322320	to talk shit. It's old and it's pointless. Get a new hobby. No one wants to hear you
4322320	4327600	bitch the whole time. People may want to hear you bitch for a little bit. And I like to think
4327600	4334640	that we keep our bitching to an appropriate level of, of bitch-festing. If that's not a word it is
4335600	4341920	now. Um, but I also like to think, and it could also, I mean, I don't want to do like,
4341920	4348320	oh, the old mature gamer, get off my lawn, bullshit. But I think it also though does go
4348320	4356960	that we are adults. We are well, well-rounded adults for the most part. You know what I mean?
4357760	4365280	And we have experience in the communities that we're in and in our, this lifestyle that we're in
4366240	4372720	that we've seen the ebb and flow, and we've seen what different attitudes can have. And we know
4372720	4381520	that all we see is just cyclical, you know, we know politics are involved. We know it goes much
4381520	4388240	further than just, oh, I like this game and I don't like this game. And I think that for us,
4389840	4397120	because we know this, that's where we're better equipped to have these discussions and to know
4397120	4403600	the right way to criticize. Well, and to be fair, I think we have to still be careful to elevate
4403600	4407360	ourselves too much. There's a lot of podcasts that do get it right. That's why I was still
4407360	4416240	saying stuff. But I think that, well, I mean, it pretty much is that just because we know
4416240	4421920	these things doesn't make us any better than anybody else's opinion. It's just we can deliver
4421920	4430160	it. And I think that some of our younger people, or I'm even going to say even older people,
4430160	4437760	people who are susceptible to that sort of push that these social platforms have.
4438400	4444240	And I honestly think that, yeah, there are a lot of people out there who are that gullible and
4444240	4449920	will fall right into the trap because they are groomed to fall into that trap. And they let
4449920	4455280	themselves be groomed to fall into that trap. Taking that step back from it is difficult.
4456000	4462400	And I think that just us as people, we have gotten to the point where we can take a step back from
4463040	4466960	those environments, even though we have grown up with the advent of social media.
4468320	4473600	I got something in my eye. No, you're fine. But I hope that made sense. It's not sort of like a
4473600	4478480	self elevation sort of thing. It's more of an experience thing. It does. I get it. I get it.
4478480	4484320	And not everyone is going to have that perfect storm of experiences. It's going to teach them,
4484320	4491040	I need to disengage or I may be anonymous now, but some asshole is going to find me.
4494240	4498800	So before we get to the next segment, I never got around to this. No, no, you're fine. I think this
4498800	4502480	is actually a really good discussion. I think it's great. But I do need to mention at some point,
4502480	4509120	the other big headline out of the VR meta stuff is that the new CEO of all this, Zuckerberg,
4509120	4515040	announced that Grand Theft Auto San Andreas from the year 2004 will be getting a VR port for the
4515040	4520880	Oculus Quest, or excuse me, the meta Quest 2. I got to get used to this now. In the event,
4520880	4524880	Zuckerberg said, this new version of what I think is one of the greatest games ever made
4524880	4529120	will offer players an entirely new way to experience this iconic open world in virtual
4529120	4534320	reality. I'm really bummed out Loki's not here tonight to because, you know, you all know his
4534320	4538560	feelings on all these ports. So I'm really bummed out. We can't ask him about this tonight, but,
4538560	4543280	you know, we will next week at the top of the show when he's back. So I have nothing further
4543280	4547680	to say on this for now. It's, you know, I'm very much of the mindset that, like, you shouldn't
4547680	4554080	shove games in VR just because you can. But if they're making mindful, meaningful changes to it
4554080	4560960	to make VR really enhance the game, then I guess I would keep an open mind. But I don't know. I
4560960	4567840	feel like there's so many games I care more about in the immediate term than a port of Grand Theft
4567840	4573600	Auto San Andreas. You guys are lighting up chat. Some of you talking about the Resident Evil 4.
4574400	4578480	Questbuster says, I heard the Resident Evil 4 VR port is supposed to be really good. Well,
4578480	4582960	you know, if they if they actually went back, retooled it, made it something for VR,
4582960	4588320	then cool, that probably does really work. SSJ100Matt kind of going back to, you know,
4588320	4592800	the other discussion Dark Soccer and I were having saying, parts of the internet have given
4592800	4597760	every person a microphone. Give a billion people a megaphone, a large portion of those voices are
4597760	4602480	going to be trash. Best way to drown it out is with being positive, not contribute to that
4602480	4607920	nonsense and be part of an awesome community that is like minded and positive thinking, like VOG.
4607920	4611200	Thank you very much for that. Yes. But I, you know, there's lots of great
4611200	4615200	That warmed my cold heart. At least a degree. At least a degree. At least a degree.
4616640	4621120	All right. I think enough enough about VR and all of these newfangled games.
4621680	4626480	Let's go to an old favorite segment here in this next sequence here.
4638320	4643840	And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull
4643840	4648800	out a classic and tell you about it. It's time for the classic game of the week.
4649120	4653200	All right, Dark Soccer, what did you pick tonight for the classic game of the week?
4653840	4657360	I tried to pick something scary that I haven't done before. So I picked Galerians.
4659760	4662160	I'm going to have to pay real quick just so you know, too. Sorry.
4662720	4669840	I guess. Leave me by myself. I see how it is. Anyway, Galerians came out in 1999
4669840	4677280	in Japan, August 26th, that is, in North America, March 29th, 2000, and in Europe, June 9th, 2000.
4677920	4685840	It is a survival horror game that was developed by Polygon Magic for PlayStation. You play as a
4685840	4695440	boy named Rion who discovers he has psychic powers. He also has amnesia. And as he learns who he is,
4695440	4700640	he learns that he is to survive against. He's going to help everyone survive against the
4700640	4705680	Galerians, which are these genetically enhanced humans. And there is a sequel, by the way.
4705680	4712480	Galerians Ash came out on PS2 a little while later. And it is one of the earliest survival
4712480	4720160	horror games. It was kind of compared to Resident Evil at the time. It has the whole tank control
4720160	4729280	thing where, you know, you hold up or down to move around, you know, but you have to readjust
4729280	4736240	your camera, you know, as you're going along. You also, it is a 3D game, had pre-rendered
4736240	4741920	backgrounds. And as you go through the games, you find items and clues and you use that to unlock
4741920	4750000	new areas and keep going around. But Galerians doesn't have any gun-based combat. It uses psychic
4750000	4760240	powers. So Rion has different powers. He has a telepathic sense to gain clues and do puzzles.
4761760	4769680	His offensive powers he get by taking drugs. Or as in the English version, PPEC,
4769680	4777040	psychic power enhancement chemicals, he's taking drugs. So each one of those vials
4780240	4787760	that you get is finite. So you have to conserve them. They have one to two second charge time.
4788560	4792480	And so you have to find the right interval to attack. Timing is everything.
4795920	4801840	So if you defeat an enemy with that, then they won't leave any items and you don't get
4801840	4810320	experience. So you're trying to avoid combat when you can. There are three gauges for status. One's
4810320	4818000	a health meter for damage. The other one is AP absorption points, which adds up as Rion takes
4818000	4824000	damage, uses his ability or under stress, kind of like a limit break. And it depletes as he uses
4824000	4831280	his powers. When the meter is full, he loses control of his powers and has a continuous
4831280	4835520	psychic assault power that will basically kill everybody except a boss in a single blow.
4837040	4846800	And it can be fatal to Rion if it goes unchecked. So anyway, it was a fairly interesting game.
4846800	4855280	It had a fairly interesting story. It also has to do with themes of AIs and things of,
4855920	4859840	you know, have you surpassed your creator and different things like that.
4860560	4867520	It was quite the interesting theme. And it was a very interesting spin for its time. It got fairly
4868800	4876000	decent, kind of middle of the road to good ratings. And then it actually had some others
4876000	4883200	that came apart from it. So there were two light novels that were written by Takiguchi Maki, came
4883200	4891200	out in 2000 and just talked about the details of the game. It was a CGI three-part OAV that came
4891200	4898160	out in 2002 called Galerians Rion. And it basically, again, follows the story. There's also
4898160	4906160	an art book called Galerians A-Head, as in A-H-E-A-D, not as a head, but A-head, that had preliminary
4906160	4912960	sketches, character stuff, box art, storyboards, general artwork from the games and the OVAs. It
4913760	4924480	was illustrated by Tajime Sho. So there you go. We only ever got the two games. By the way, the
4925680	4931360	distribution in Japan was by ASCII Entertainment and everywhere else in the world by Crave
4931360	4937920	Entertainment. And there you go. I'm unfamiliar with this game. It somehow was like never on my
4937920	4943040	radar, honestly. It was, I had friends who were really into it and then I had friends who were
4943040	4950640	like, what? So, yeah. All right. Yeah, it's a neat little game. Galerians Ash was really good.
4952160	4957600	All right. There you go. Well, there it is, your classic game of the week, a little bit spooky-ish.
4957600	4963040	Galerian is your classic game of the week. So, all right. I'll have to check that one out. Again,
4963040	4966800	it's not one I'm super familiar with, to be honest. So just never got around to that one.
4967360	4972400	Yeah. I just don't, I don't like the tank control type stuff. So I didn't play too far into it,
4972400	4978080	but when I played, I liked it. It was really fun exploding people's heads. All right. Kind of like
4978080	4982960	scanners. So we just have a little bit more for you before we get to the listener round table.
4982960	4986640	I did say at the top of the show, it's probably going to be a shorter show tonight. So if you do
4986640	4990000	want to call in or something, you can make your way over to Discord in our green room over at
4990000	4994400	vognetwork.com slash Discord. Even if you don't want to call in, I encourage you to join our
4994400	4999840	Discord. It doesn't everyone have a Discord now, but we have a community there where you can kind
4999840	5004400	of post stories throughout the week. We pull a lot of stories there for our show and talk to us.
5004400	5007840	And there's all sorts of different topics and fun things that go on Discord. So again, that's
5007840	5013040	vognetwork.com slash Discord. But before we do that, let's travel around the world and check out
5013040	5017840	some release dates. With Loki not here tonight, I'm going to try my best to take on the US dates
5017840	5022160	here tonight. So coming out this week on November, and here we go, we're getting into November. So
5022160	5028160	we got a lot of releases now. On the Nintendo Switch this week, on the second, we have Cupid
5028160	5033680	Parasite and World War Z. We also have Knockout City making its way to PlayStation 5 and the
5033680	5037040	Series X. I think that game was already out, because I know I've had friends that are trying
5037040	5041680	to get me to play it. But it's now coming out for the more, I guess, next gen or current gen,
5041680	5046800	depending on where your head is at, systems. On the fourth, I remember we talked about this before,
5046800	5051520	but A Boy and His Blob making its way to the Nintendo Switch. I believe this is a port of
5051520	5057680	that Wii version, which is a Wii-make, get it, of the original NES game, which was kind of an
5058240	5063280	underground kind of indie cultish kind of hit that never, no, it did get a sequel on the Game Boy,
5063280	5069600	I think, actually, if I remember right. So it's a very different kind of game. Just Dance 2022 is
5069600	5075360	out on everything, because those games always come out on everything. I think finally, though,
5075360	5080000	they have stopped making them for the Wii, and all systems older than that. But that is out this
5080000	5087280	week, so you can get the latest and greatest Just Dance game. Tales of Luminaria. This is the Tales
5087280	5093280	game for mobile. That is also out on the fourth. And a game called Where Cards Fall, a puzzle game
5093280	5100000	out for PC and Nintendo Switch. And then on the fifth, we have Call of Duty Vanguard is going to
5100000	5105120	be coming out on a variety of different systems and because it's a Call of Duty game. And then
5105120	5112160	the Kid A Amnesia exhibition, remember that random radio head thing? Apparently that is out
5112800	5118320	this week for Windows, Mac, and PS5 on the fifth of November. So that will be-
5118320	5119360	Remember, remember.
5119360	5119860	That's right.
5120640	5122400	Also, that's my mom's birthday.
5122400	5123440	Is it really?
5123440	5123940	Yeah, it is.
5124800	5129680	In the not too distant future, Forza Horizon 5 coming out on the ninth. But I think there
5129920	5135280	is an early access thing if you pay the extra money to get into the early access. I did not,
5135280	5138960	so I'll wait for the ninth. But I know Bobby said he always gives a lot of money for Forza
5138960	5143760	Horizon because it's his favorite series. So I think he gets in earlier in the week. But the
5143760	5149280	official release of that game is actually in next week's releases on November the ninth. Why don't
5149280	5153600	we hop over to the UK if we could while I get Japan's dates up, Dark Sakura?
5154400	5158240	Sure. And I will need an AFK after that.
5158240	5158740	That's fine.
5159460	5166020	So we have on November 2nd, we have World War Z Aftermath on Switch.
5167140	5172580	Further on the second, we have Astria Ascending for Switch and PlayStation,
5173140	5180260	Hell Let Loose on PlayStation and Xbox, Fortnite Minty Legends Pack on the three, the big three.
5180260	5187860	On the fourth, we have Just Dance 2022 on the big three, Call of Duty Vanguard on the fifth,
5189620	5197940	also the Nintendo Switch Lite Pokemon, Diaga and Palkia. We have Fast and Furious Spy Racers,
5197940	5203460	Rise of Shifter also on the fifth. And that looks like what it is.
5206020	5206520	All right.
5209300	5213940	Yes, that's fine. Let me go to the Japanese releases while Dark Sakura takes a break there.
5213940	5220100	So let's start on the Switch for Japan. We have Danganronpa Decadence is out this week.
5220100	5224740	So I know there's lots of people that are really hardcore into Danganronpa. I don't believe this
5224740	5230020	is a new game. I think it is a repackaging of the big three Danganronpa games, but it also has
5230020	5236020	Danganronpa S Ultimate Summer Camp, which is like an expanded version of the bonus content from
5236020	5241060	Danganronpa V3. So it sounds like it's really like a definitive Danganronpa collection that's
5241060	5246420	out in Japan this week for the Switch. Model debut to Nicola. I have no idea what that is,
5246420	5250980	but that is also out this week on the fourth. Of course, Just Dance 2022 also making its way
5250980	5262580	to Japan this week. And there's also the Pokemon Diaga and Palkia Nintendo Switches are out this
5262580	5267220	week in Japan. So that is also something to look forward to. And I think those are making their
5267220	5271620	way over here too. Just didn't show up in our release dates here, but that is all happening
5271620	5278820	November 5th because the redo of Diamond and Pearl are not that far away. So of course,
5278820	5285620	they want to get that special Switch out for those. Heading over to the PlayStation 5,
5285620	5290260	there's something called the Fortnite Minty Legends pack, and it is coming out in Japan.
5290260	5293380	I think there's versions of that that are also coming out in other territories,
5293380	5298500	but Japan can't escape the Fortnite stuff either. I'm sure it's probably not as big a deal there,
5298500	5302420	but they are releasing that. And then the other big release in the PlayStation 5 this week,
5302420	5309860	of course, Call of Duty Vanguard also releasing in Japan. All right, I'm going to the chat over
5309860	5315540	at twitch.tv slash vog network. S2100 Matt says, how many versions of the Pokemon game is Shane
5315540	5322260	buying is the real question? I'm guessing four. Last I checked with Shane, and if he's out there,
5322260	5329540	he can speak for himself, but the remakes are not landing for him the same way the Arceus Legends
5329540	5335300	stuff is. So that is, I think, what he's really looking forward to. I don't think he planned.
5335300	5341060	I think he'll buy probably at least one, but I don't think you're going to see him buy like
5341060	5345860	eight copies. I think he's passed that for these remakes. So and I don't know if he was getting
5345860	5353060	the actual Pokemon switches, so we'll have him back on the show to ask. I have M&Ms. Lucky. All
5353060	5360100	right, let's move on. Don't eat on air. Meet yourself. All right, let's go to I needed chocolate.
5361460	5367380	Let's go to one more story here, and then we'll get to some emails and maybe some calls. And this
5367380	5376180	story has to do with, get this, another Super Smash Brothers kind of clone is on its way. And
5376180	5382660	this is coming from Warner Brothers, apparently, is going to be putting this one out. And it's
5382660	5388340	coming from basically a leak that's online. It looks like it's a free-to-play title, and they
5388340	5395140	are saying it kind of looks cheap with this. And with this game, some characters have already been
5395140	5399940	spotted. There's a screenshot out there which really kind of lends credit to this is probably
5399940	5406820	true. Like Rick on there. Yeah, Rick from Rick and Morty, Tom from Tom and Jerry, Bugs Bunny's there,
5406820	5412020	Superman. Where are the Warner Brothers and the Warner Sister dot? Well, this is only one
5412020	5416420	screenshot. So the Warner Brothers and the Warner Sister dot could be on their way. It could be DLC,
5416420	5420500	but it's just it's interesting to see this, especially right after this Nickelodeon thing
5420500	5425060	had just come out. And it's kind of making the waves that it's making is that now we have the
5425060	5430740	this other one coming. Now, while we are in chat says you get what you pay for. Possibly. It sounds
5430740	5436180	like that could be the case with this as it is free to play. But it is still rumor. It's
5436180	5443620	unconfirmed. But the screenshot is is pretty. I mean, it does not look like a bunch of copy
5443620	5448980	pasted images together because it looks like these characters have all been rendered in a similar way
5448980	5453700	for this game. And I think that's what makes it very compelling evidence. I guess it could be a
5453700	5457700	fan thing at the end of the day, but it's looking it's looking like there's a little smoke here and
5457700	5464820	there's probably fire. So we'll see when this possibly comes to fruition with that. Let's get
5464820	5469700	to you guys and your feedback. We can do some comments. We don't as well know. Of course,
5469700	5474260	we have to. We have to get to the emails. Participate at Orange Lounge. Radio dot com is
5474260	5478660	the place to send your emails every week. Of course, you can also join our green room over
5478660	5483060	at Vogue Network dot com slash discord. I know there's about half the audience here tonight.
5483060	5487780	There usually is just between Halloween and World Series and all this other stuff. There's just a
5487780	5492260	lot going on today. Probably be a lot of podcast folks. You can email us anytime. Of course,
5492260	5496020	participate at Orange Lounge Radio dot com. Let's get to email Stark Sakura.
5497460	5501060	OK, so first email is back from the 22nd.
5501140	5510180	A new entry would be preferable, of course, but has Rockstar released a 2D trilogy,
5510180	5516260	remaster of Grand Theft Auto, GTA London and GTA 2? And that's from Robert M. I don't know.
5516260	5521780	I don't think so. I think it's been a while. They did release, re-release them at one point.
5522500	5526820	And I think it might have been like a preorder bonus or something for one of them newer GTA
5526820	5536660	games. But I don't think we visited those games in a while. There was also the 3DS question mark
5536660	5541620	Grand Theft Auto game that was more inspired by the it was Chinatown Wars was the name of it.
5541620	5546260	And it was more inspired by the classic Grand Theft Auto games. But it wasn't really a remake
5546260	5556500	either. So. All right. All right. So we have one more email. It's from YYR, so it's a long one.
5557540	5561940	Hello, LR. Once again, I was catching up on slightly older episodes and felt the need
5561940	5565060	to chime in. Thanks for giving me an extra week to catch up. He he.
5565780	5571060	During the action packed three hour episode from October 10th, it was mentioned that direct credit
5571060	5575620	card payments will no longer be allowed for digital purposes on PS3 and Vita. It was speculated
5575620	5582580	that this might just might be the beginning of the actual end for those stores. Well, as someone
5582580	5587780	who just purchased a bunch of stuff on Vita this month, I can tell you that it's already barely
5587780	5594660	working in order to download any of my Vita purchases or transfer them to Vita from PS3.
5594660	5600500	I had to mash the download button many times before it would work. Most of those times it
5600500	5607380	would error out with a nonsense error messaging code. There were posts about this all over the
5607380	5612100	Internet, but I doubt they'll fix it because why would they? I'm probably the only one who still
5613220	5617700	buying Vita games anyway. I don't think you're alone, but it's not a lot of people.
5619060	5624260	I will mention that Microsoft is not entirely off the hook for things like this. Just try performing
5624260	5630660	a license transfer on your Xbox 360. In the likely event that you get an error, you're basically
5630660	5637780	screwed. Enjoy reading all of the posts from other frustrated users trying to get answers from MS
5637780	5643940	as to why it's busted and when or if it will work again. So the new achievement system for
5643940	5648340	the Epic Games Store was mentioned. Let me tell you, this is the most half-assed broken
5648340	5655860	garbage achievement system I've ever seen because we've seen many times over the last 15 years that
5655860	5660500	a game will come out with achievements and trophies and then it will get DLC and then
5660500	5664900	more achievements or trophies are added. Well, guess what? On Epic Store, this is not possible
5664900	5670020	at all. Their new achievement system comes with three mandates. All achievements will be
5670020	5674820	associated with a point value. The number of points must sum up to a total of 1,000. No more,
5674820	5680900	no less. Once the achievements go live, they cannot be altered in any way. So next year,
5680900	5685380	I'm going to be releasing my expansion for Super Multitasking. I'm going to be changing some
5685380	5690900	existing achievements to make them more easily obtainable and I'm going to be adding new ones.
5690900	5696020	If I was on the Epic Games Store, this would not be possible. I bet you're going to see a number
5696020	5700740	of developers choose not to bother rather than risk being locked into something forever. It's
5700740	5706340	stupid. It sucks and I hate it. On the plus side, my ears perked up when you mentioned Konami's
5706340	5711380	contest for indie developers to revive some of their dormant franchises. On the minus side,
5711380	5716100	I'm disqualified. In order to be eligible, you must live in Japan. So I apologize, but you won't
5716100	5720900	be seeing a new version of Gyruss for me anytime soon. You know what else you won't be seeing from
5720900	5726580	me? A Pixel Poops E-Football crossover. Don't worry, you're better off. The collision detection
5726580	5731300	would have been broken and the jogger's AI would have been busted too. Have you ever seen a jogger
5731300	5736020	that forgot how to jog? Be glad that you never will. Anyway, thanks for the show and have a
5736020	5743460	fantastic week. Hugs, Aaron YYR. Great email, YYR. Yeah, I guess we overlooked a pretty,
5743460	5748740	pretty obvious point there in the contest that, yeah, in order to win a Japanese contest,
5748740	5753060	you probably have to be from Japan. Obviously, I never expected you were really going to enter
5753060	5758420	in anyway, but it's fun to imagine, isn't it? Very interesting on the Epic achievement fronts. I had
5758420	5763460	no idea it was that like ridiculous, especially when they're catching up. You know, in a related
5763460	5768020	ish kind of story, there was some rumors and I didn't put them in the show world, but I guess
5768020	5773060	we'll bring it up here. Nintendo may actually be finally looking at doing achievements.
5773140	5777140	And this is from some stuff that I think I, it was data mined somewhere, I think in the latest
5777140	5782420	firmware update and a heavy rumor that Splatoon 3 may be the first game with them. And that,
5782420	5786420	I guess it ties in maybe the way Nintendo has been doing mobile achievements, but I haven't been
5786420	5790580	really paying attention to a lot of Nintendo mobile titles. So I haven't really seen how
5790580	5795780	this works, but it's interesting. Nintendo's looking at it too. And I hope it's not as crappy
5795780	5803060	as what Epic is doing, which really sounds copy pasted from the Xbox 360.
5805140	5811460	But the Xbox 360 was before so many people were doing DLC. You know, like I remember 360,
5811460	5816020	everything was capped at a thousand, everything had to add up to a thousand, but there were some
5816020	5820180	exceptions. Like I think all the DLC for Oblivion got to add some extra achievements and stuff, but
5820900	5826260	like, I just, yeah, it's, I feel like that was not the thing to copy.
5827860	5831860	It'll be interesting to see how that plays out. I wonder if PlayStation 3, oh, you know,
5831860	5837780	PlayStation 3 trophies could be updated because I remember DLC would add like a little plus sign
5837780	5840740	and it would almost treat it like a different game. But yeah, it just seems like something's
5840740	5846260	a little bit backwards and old with what is happening. I don't know. YYR in chat says,
5846260	5850820	maybe Splatoon 3 has its own achievement system that just works within the game itself.
5850820	5854340	I think some Switch games do that. Oh, certainly that could be there,
5854340	5860820	but keep in mind, Splatoon 3 is nowhere near being out. People are peeking under the hood
5860820	5865700	at the firmware and seeing indications of it there. And so that's why it seems to be something
5865700	5870980	that's not constrained just to the game. Animal Crossing they're saying is also kind of rumored
5870980	5874500	for this, which is weird because most people have already kind of come and gone from Animal Crossing,
5875380	5878900	but not to say they couldn't retroactively add things. It could be interesting.
5878900	5882100	I think achievements for the classic NES games would be something,
5882100	5886340	but I don't ever see Nintendo putting the effort into it. So we'll see.
5886340	5888420	Congratulations. You cheated at Contra.
5888420	5892580	Yeah. I like that. All right. Any more emails?
5894580	5895140	No.
5895140	5899460	Okay. Participate at Orangelaunchradio.com if you want to send us a future email.
5899860	5904020	Um, we're about to wrap up, but we usually do last minute stories here.
5904020	5908980	Loki's not here to do any last minute stories, but the chat room jumping in here with a last
5908980	5914020	minute story. This one's, um, could be a big one. As Joe and Hunter Matt linked us to this one,
5914020	5919620	the headline, and this is from Sega's websites and from their Japanese website, sega.co.jp.
5920740	5928420	Sega and Microsoft to explore a strategic alliance to create new strategic titles for Sega
5928420	5931300	and established a next generation development environment.
5932100	5933300	So strategic.
5933300	5939220	Now that's now for all the hubaloo where people were saying Microsoft needs to buy Sega.
5940180	5945860	It doesn't seem like that's happening, but this is very interesting. Let's move on.
5945860	5948820	I guess I can read this word for word because it's an official press release.
5949620	5953860	Sega and Microsoft have agreed in principle, a strategic alliance that explores ways for
5953860	5958020	Sega to produce large scale global games in a next generation development environment
5958020	5962660	built on Microsoft's Azure cloud platform. This alliance would form a key part of Sega's
5962660	5966980	mid to longterm strategy, allowing the business to move forward with super game,
5966980	5971700	a new initiative for developing new and innovative titles where the key focuses are global online
5971700	5976740	community and IP utilization. With the world now more connected than ever following the
5976740	5981780	widespread deployment of 5g and cloud services in recent years, consumers can more easily enjoy
5981780	5985940	high quality entertainment content at any time within this high connected environment,
5985940	5989620	the ecosystem surrounding the games industry continues to evolve and expand as more
5989620	5993860	sophisticated tools and technology become available. As such, video games continue to
5993860	5998260	grow as a major medium for gamers globally with access to a vast range of gaming experiences and
5998260	6002980	communities becoming more diverse and attainable. Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Here we go.
6002980	6007780	The proposed alliance represents Sega looking ahead and by working with Microsoft to anticipate
6007780	6013460	such trends as they accelerate further in future, the global is to optimize development processes
6013460	6018500	and continue to bring high quality experiences to players using Azure cloud technologies.
6019060	6024340	Microsoft and Sega have agreed upon the foundation for this alliance and through mutual cooperation
6024340	6029140	will look to build further technological evolutions with areas such as the network
6029140	6035140	infrastructure and communication tools required for global online services being a key priority.
6035140	6038820	Additionally, by shifting to a next generation development platform,
6038820	6044100	Sega can effectively adapt to diversifying work styles and potential infrastructural changes.
6045860	6051780	Interesting. Because nowhere in that do I see the word Xbox.
6053780	6058020	So, it doesn't seem like, and I think there will be people that read into this that say,
6058020	6065620	oh, Sega's going to do exclusive Xbox games. That might be a conclusion jumping to, but when I hear
6065620	6071780	the Azure cloud stuff too, that could really just be, you know, Sega, it really sounds like
6071780	6077620	Phantasy Star Online 2 has done pretty well and they're probably, because, you know, you talk
6077620	6081460	about the online experience, it sounds like Sega may be developing something else in the online
6081460	6086740	space. They're going to use Microsoft's technology to help them out. I just wish we would get like
6086740	6095140	another dedicated console again. Right. YYRS says what do these Azure powered games even look like?
6095140	6100500	Stuff like Flight Simulator maybe? Maybe. That's actually not a bad call because I think Flight
6100500	6105300	Simulator is powered in part by the cloud and how they get a lot of that real time weather and all
6105300	6112180	of that information. So, maybe Sega's looking at doing something, you know, of that sort of scope
6112180	6116820	and it's probably something we don't know of. Of course, it's something we don't know of, but I
6116820	6121140	mean like maybe not an existing franchise. So, I don't think I would read into this. It means,
6121220	6125620	oh, it means Yakuza or it means Sonic or anything like that or Phantasy Star even.
6126660	6131860	It could be something new that Sega's up to. I don't know. S.G.O. 100 Matt says so I'm reading
6131860	6136740	this as Microsoft is giving them dev tools for free in exchange for something. Whatever that
6136740	6140980	something is, we'll see in a few years. It's very possible Microsoft is going to be given an
6140980	6147780	exclusive window for Sega's next big game and that could be a huge deal because when I see Azure
6147780	6154420	Cloud, it ain't going to be for Nintendo. So, the switch is out. So, that means that Sega, you know,
6154420	6160100	and obviously Microsoft's Achilles heel is Japan and the Japanese market. We've known this for a
6160100	6165220	long time. They need an alliance like this. I don't think this is alliance as much as some
6165220	6171620	people may think it is, but it's a start. So, it'll be very interesting. We'll see what develops
6171620	6179460	from this. Thank you for the share. Definitely very interesting. It is. It is. All right. What's
6179460	6187540	this thing about an epic store? What, the other link that was in chat there? Yeah.
6188820	6195780	Oh, it's a new character for Fortnite or a character set for Fortnite. I heard Fortnite's
6195780	6199940	going to close in China. That was another headline I had scrolled by earlier. I guess something about
6199940	6203540	some, you know, all the crackdowns that's happening with gaming there is going to affect Fortnite in
6203540	6212820	China. It's interesting. There's actually another one just for the ones who do the Roblox thing.
6212820	6217380	Apparently, they were out for three days and now Roblox is back up. Yeah. Roblox. I figure there's
6217380	6221620	not a lot of our audience that plays that, but yeah, they were down for a little while.
6222260	6226420	Well, now there's like some horror games also available on Xbox Game Pass right now.
6226900	6230500	Yeah, I think there's some of the websites are just highlighting games. I don't think there's
6230500	6236260	anything new. I think that's for blood is on there. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's kind of cool.
6236260	6242660	Quest Buster, I think with a really interesting perspective on the Microsoft Sega thing. Imagine
6242660	6248340	leveraging that technology for their subsidiary studios, like for Creative Assembly and its Total
6248340	6254660	War series. Very interesting thought. Tiger Claw says, who knows what this alliance will lead to?
6255540	6263380	Microsoft buys Sega. I think that's very premature. In fact, I think a headline like this
6264420	6271620	actually pulls away from that because I think a headline like this shows no, Microsoft's not
6271620	6275460	buying Sega, but they are going to have a partnership. I think that's a very different
6275460	6280660	thing. So I actually, Tiger Claw, I completely see how you jump to that conclusion. And I bet
6280660	6285780	many YouTubes and many tweets and many podcasts you listen to are going to jump to that conclusion.
6285780	6293140	But I think this actually distances it from an actual purchase. I think we get the agreement
6293140	6299860	and that's what it is and not an actual purchase or anything. And I think that it would be
6300420	6309620	financially unwise for Microsoft to acquire Sega in that manner, because I think Sega on its own
6310900	6316420	would be more profitable as a partner than as a subsidiary.
6318660	6322340	Deft in chat on the Fortnite thing is bringing some perspective to the new character. It's not
6322340	6328900	just any character. It is a Mexican TV character that is turning 51 years old. El Chapulin,
6328900	6336260	Colorado is coming to Fortnite. And of course, Deft being our official ambassador to the country
6336260	6341380	of Mexico here at OLR. And I mean that because I always appreciate hearing his perspective from
6341380	6347380	in Mexico. Obviously, that's a pretty cool deal to see some of that representation in the game.
6347380	6353780	That's pretty cool. That's really cool. Yeah. All right. The Crimson Grasshopper. I think that's
6353780	6357140	going to do it for another episode of Orange Launch Radio. Thank you so much for tuning into
6357140	6360340	our show, especially when we were gone last week. And I know it's been a shorter show tonight,
6360340	6364660	but you guys know it's just the way it played out. But we'll be back next week. Everybody will
6364660	6369300	be here. Good long power outages notwithstanding. Knock on wood, but we should be past all that.
6369300	6373940	Hopefully, we will be back to do it all again. Thank you guys for downloading our show or
6373940	6377460	listening to us live. However you participated. If you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange
6377460	6381060	Launch Radio, help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice,
6381060	6385620	but we need the voices to be here in chat. So tell a friend or two about the show. A nice
6385620	6390580	five star review on a site like iTunes or wherever it is you found the show. We're going off a long
6390580	6396740	way. Sharing the Spotify link on social media or whatever it is. All that stuff is greatly
6396740	6402260	appreciated. If you feel so inclined, we have a shop with merch and you can check that out
6402260	6407940	at vognetwork.com slash shop. You can pick yourself up a OLRT shirt or a VOG Network shirt or
6407940	6414660	whatever it is you want to pick up there. That is there as well. And I think that's about all I have
6414660	6419460	to say. I think it's time to get our final thoughts. Dark Soccer, I'll go to you because I
6419460	6421940	know you want to get out of here and get set up for your stream. So what's your final thought
6421940	6427860	tonight? Um, my final thought is I probably shouldn't have eaten this candy. And I got
6427860	6432340	to put that hot jacket back on in a few, but I'll probably do it partly into my stream.
6432900	6436100	All right. Trick or treat. I'm starting early tonight. So who knows what's going to happen?
6436100	6440180	Who knows? Anything's possible. All right, Dark Soccer. We'll see you later. Thanks for being
6440180	6446740	here. Anything can happen on Halloween. I love that. Good night. Take care. You too. Good night.
6447540	6452500	Uh, and then for my final thought tonight, I guess I would say, um, I'm all by myself now.
6452500	6458180	That's a little weird, but I would just say. All by myself. I had to do it, Rob. All right. All
6458180	6464500	right. Um, I don't know what else to say. Thank you. Thank you for being here. And, uh, I had
6464500	6468820	some great times hosting over the weekend and I'm looking forward to doing more of that in 2022.
6468820	6473540	Hopefully more conventions as well. Hopefully we see the world get a little more back to normal
6473540	6479220	so we can do that kind of stuff. And, uh, that's, that's all I got. We're going to see you again in
6479220	6483140	seven days. You guys have a great night, everybody. We'll see you next time here on Orange Lounge
6483140	6489300	Radio. Good night. You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio. Orange Lounge Radio is
