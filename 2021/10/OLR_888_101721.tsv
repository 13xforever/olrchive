0	13880	Sony might be ushering in a new normal of direct sales and delivery with their announcement
13880	17600	that they will be handing out golden tickets to players allowed to purchase a PS5.
17600	21000	The unstated goal of this is to link purchases to unique players and keep machines out of
21000	24180	the hands of scalpers, since supply is chronically short as it is.
24180	26320	But will retailers feel slighted anyway?
26320	28920	Yeah, pretty likely.
28920	32360	This is one story in a varied night, now it's time for your hosts Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers
32360	35320	and Loki to tell you more about this and the rest of the week's gaming news, starting right
35320	37840	now on the show where every gamer has a voice.
37840	48280	Hello my friends, out there on the internet, welcome back to another week of the show where
48280	50400	every gamer has a voice.
50400	57020	It is Orange Lounge Radio and we are back once again with episode number 888 of our
57020	61140	show for tonight, October the 17th of 2021.
61140	63980	My name is Rob Roberts and I'm going to do a rushed intro here.
63980	66780	My co-hosts DarkSakura are Jamie Summers.
66780	67780	Hi.
67780	70420	Hi, and Techmaster Loki.
70420	71420	Hello.
71420	74900	Hello, we're getting a little bit of a late start tonight.
74900	78580	For the folks on the podcast feed, it's a normal week, whatever.
78580	82180	For those that are watching live tonight, we're getting a little bit of a late start.
82180	87780	It's actually closer to 6.35 Pacific time where we're located, 9.35 for those of you
87780	90180	on the East Coast.
90180	93940	We do tape live, of course, every Sunday night at the Voice of Geeks Network, twitch.tv slash
93940	96900	vog network, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.
96900	99460	Usually we start about 6 Pacific, 9 Eastern.
99460	105100	But what happened is right about 5.45 our time, I got hit with a power outage here at
105100	110600	OLR headquarters where we used to gather in person before the pandemic and all that stuff.
110600	114860	And obviously since the broadcasting stuff is here, if there's no power, we can't do
114860	115860	a show.
115860	119320	So I hastily tried to text Bobby and let him know what was going on.
119320	124480	Usually I would try to watch, but the cell tower I think got taken out too because my
124480	126760	signal was terrible.
126760	130520	So that part was really unfortunate, but we got through it.
130520	131520	We're here now.
131520	132520	We're just a little delayed.
132520	138140	So thank you very much to our pal Bobby Black Wolf who was coming back from being gone due
138140	141940	to a medical thing for the past couple of weeks and ended up doing a jumbo show tonight.
141940	144900	So thank you Bobby for vamping a little bit for us.
144900	147820	And I'm glad we all could be here and actually do a show.
147820	149420	And hi to everybody in chat.
149420	152060	Shehulk10 in chat says, better late than never.
152060	153820	Yes, I suppose that is the case.
153820	156500	Or as the Golden Girls say, better late than pregnant.
156500	157740	So there you go.
157740	164500	Anyhow, also, I also noticed just now in our chat live, they just hit that goal for Orange
164500	165740	Lounge Foodio.
165740	167060	So guess what, guys?
167060	172340	We get to do a special episode all about food and we'll do that in the coming weeks.
172340	175500	You guys hit that a lot sooner than we expected it to happen.
175500	179580	So that show is actually probably going to happen in early mid-November just because
179580	183180	there's a lot of stuff going on and we're not going to be here.
183180	185260	We're definitely not going to be here next week.
185260	188980	I am not going to be here because I am going to LA.
188980	190860	Dark Soccer is also going out of town.
190860	192780	And I can talk about it.
192780	193780	Okay.
194500	198140	I don't want to put you on the spot, but if you're volunteering, please talk about it.
198140	205840	So last week, I'm sure a lot of you know that I was talking about doing a marathon to raise
205840	208620	money for my friend Barbara's GoFundMe.
208620	212940	She'd just been diagnosed with cancer, just started chemotherapy.
212940	225860	And partway through the marathon, which was on Monday, I did get a message from her wife,
225860	231180	her partner, that she died.
231180	239980	She was going into the hospital for sepsis as a reaction to the chemotherapy.
240020	253780	It had to do with the immunosuppressants, but she died.
253780	256420	And I was like, well, do you need me to call?
256420	258220	Do you need me to do anything?
258220	260300	I'd like to be there for you.
260300	261900	And she's like, nope, keep doing the marathon.
261900	267460	We now need the money to pay for the funeral.
267460	277180	And I'm just, I'm floored about it.
277180	286180	And so Tiara and I, which I'm sure some of our long-term listeners here know Tiara, and
286180	290180	Maggie actually did sing something that we played on the show.
290180	295740	She did a cover of Bang Bang.
295740	297540	People more know it maybe from Kill Bill.
297540	301620	Yeah, that's like the early OLR years, yeah, yeah.
301620	302620	Yeah.
302620	306580	So we're going out to see her and to be there for the memorial.
306580	315700	We're both doing a Thursday night red-eye and hoping to make a memorial on time.
315700	319740	But I'm super depressed.
319780	327460	Barbara was my papa's son and Maggie is my mama's son, and they both mean the universe
327460	332580	to me and Barbara went really, really fast.
332580	338540	And I suppose there's the part of me that's trying to be all logical and say it was better
338540	341420	fast than long and drawn out and painful.
341420	348780	And at the same time, Barbara was a fighter and I expected, I don't know what I expected
348780	353180	really because life is completely stupid.
353180	354620	It just happens.
354620	356940	It happens when you don't expect it.
356940	366100	And which just makes me all the more want to tell our listeners, my friends, everybody,
366100	373380	how much I love all of you and that the world is a great place to have you in it.
373380	379100	And well, yeah, fuck cancer.
379100	380100	Fuck it.
380100	382860	It's terrible.
382860	387620	And I logically know there will never be a cure for it because cancer in and of itself
387620	391140	is a series of mutations.
391140	402220	That's not going to happen, but I would encourage everybody if you can find
402220	409820	a reputable charity that's doing actual cancer research and not just merchandising stuff,
409820	411460	donate.
411460	419420	And I didn't want to use the show for this, but if you can spare something for my friend's
419420	426420	funeral expenses, talk to me offline and I'll let you know.
426420	427420	And it's fine.
427420	431340	I don't think anyone cares that you're using the show for that because anyone that's talked
431340	438500	to you for a reasonable length of time, especially right after you moved here from Alabama knows
438500	441060	how important these folks were to you.
441060	446480	So I'm truly sorry that this happened.
446480	451060	And yeah, it certainly puts a lot in perspective of a silly power outage delaying our show,
451060	455260	but there's much bigger things and you're right.
455260	458460	When something like this happens, it happens.
458460	462020	And there's just not a lot we can do sometimes.
462020	466300	So thank you.
466300	471580	Thank you for sharing the story with us and the marathon, at least when I was finally
471580	472580	able to see it.
472580	478960	So I guess trying to go back to less difficult topics that the power outage thing tonight
478960	484520	was especially frustrating because Monday when you were doing your marathon, we had
484520	486180	a power outage here again.
486180	489580	And I don't know why all of a sudden there's all these power outages.
489580	492700	Somebody on Twitter had asked me, oh, is it because California, it has nothing to do with
492700	495060	what you're hearing in the media about wildfires and all that stuff.
495060	498740	That's another company, PG&E, that doesn't service where we are in Sacramento.
498740	503180	Sacramento has their own utility and it's nothing to do with any of that.
503180	507420	I really don't know why all of a sudden power outages are a problem this week.
507420	516080	I think it is weather related because Monday we did have a really bad windstorm and now
516080	520240	it's windy outside again tonight and rain is supposed to come in.
520240	527840	So I think it's just because the last nine months, 10 months have been so dry, it's causing
527840	530060	the windstorm to knock more stuff over.
530060	533120	And I think, you know, you just you had to happen in one area on Monday and you had to
533120	535320	happen here tonight.
535320	539920	But when I was trying to participate in Dark Soccer Marathon, we lost power for it was
539920	541840	from noon until 1030.
541840	543800	So we were out of power for 10 hours.
543800	548880	So that means our food in the fridge after we had just gone to Costco had to replace
548880	549880	it.
549880	551440	That's not irritating or anything.
551440	557160	And yes, I know there's ways to get insurance and stuff, but it's still the process is still
557160	558160	a pain in the ass.
558160	559160	You know what I mean?
559160	560160	Yeah.
560160	561720	Well, it's life in a hurricane.
561720	562720	Yeah.
562720	563720	Right.
563720	564720	Right.
564720	565720	But seriously, no.
565720	570600	We would keep multiple coolers on hand and buy all the ice just for stuff like that.
570600	575640	But I remind people of this a lot, you know, especially, you know, because I hear it a
575640	579000	lot when it does rain here in California.
579000	581440	Everybody from back east will say that's not a rainstorm.
581440	582440	That's nothing.
582440	583440	You don't know what real rain is.
583440	584440	Well, I know.
584440	585440	I know.
585440	589840	But the problem is, is that it's not it's not built out here for that.
589840	593800	And that's that's what it is, because the weather is a certain way out here that places
593800	594800	not built that way.
594800	600480	It's the same reason you don't see brick homes here, because earthquakes can happen in California.
600560	604160	So we don't have brick homes like like it's just things are built a certain way because
604160	606680	of whatever natural disasters are tending to occur.
606680	611600	So we're not set up for these hurricanes and multiple power outages.
611600	614360	You know about the story of Disney World, right?
614360	615360	Which one?
615360	620840	They tried to build they tried to build Disney World like Disneyland.
620840	624840	And it mildewed and started falling apart because of the humidity.
624840	626400	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
626400	630440	So when I moved out here and I saw how things were constructed, I'm like, excuse me.
630600	631600	What?
631600	632600	No.
632600	635480	Weather's going to sneeze and this will all fall over.
635480	640480	And then like, I wouldn't go out on a wooden balcony for like three years after I moved
640480	641480	out here.
641480	642480	Sure, sure.
642480	643480	But now.
643480	644480	Yeah.
644480	647160	But now it's like, well, that's just it works here.
647160	648160	It's fine.
648160	652880	We don't until, you know, the last 10 years or so as climate change has been having its
652880	653880	impact.
653880	655440	Those sorts of things are whatever.
655440	658520	But anyway, we could go down a very big rabbit hole there.
658520	660160	We're already getting a late start tonight.
660160	664480	So I suppose we should shift the topic to something that often takes our minds off of
664480	668100	things and the other bad things going on in the world.
668100	669300	And that is video games.
669300	675560	So let's get into our kickoff topic tonight, which has to do with perhaps the future of
675560	679480	games of some sort or what some people want those to be anyway.
679480	685340	Loki, can you can you start us off with tonight's story about what Steam is going to be blocking
685340	688140	from their marketplace pretty soon?
688140	690500	I guess as they have already, I guess.
690500	692100	Yeah, they've already done it.
692100	700880	So they had blocked a few games that had NFTs or offered crypto in them.
700880	704780	And the reason that they did this and it makes sense when you think about it is they've gotten
704780	710940	in trouble before with offering items in game and having kind of an auction house where
710940	716620	you could potentially sell those in game items for real world cash.
716620	721180	And so since they've gotten in trouble, I believe in like the European unions and stuff
721180	729100	like that with that, they have been basically knocking down anything that could be potentially
729100	735140	used to give you something of value from, you know, unlocks and games and stuff like
735140	736140	that.
736140	739340	So NFTs, of course, because you could trade them for money.
739340	744540	And Bitcoin, well, I mean, that's self-explanatory, you can also trade that for money.
744540	749900	And so they have gone ahead and removed the games that had that in there.
749900	757260	Like for example, Light Night and Age of Rust was a game that they had NFTs where you could
757260	764380	actually kind of buy the NFT and use it to unlock stuff in game or something like that.
764380	765380	And then there was another game.
765380	766380	I don't remember which one it was.
766380	771580	It was like a puzzle game where you got Bitcoin if you play the puzzle or something like that.
771580	775420	So yeah, look, it makes sense.
775420	781220	Look, I and when we're talking about Bitcoin or whatever, like I and I'm not I'm not going
781220	782500	to dog on it or whatever.
782500	785740	I understand people have their environmental concerns, etc.
785740	791180	But I from the perspective of trying to critique what's going on here, I'm putting Bitcoin
791180	797180	on the same level as dollars, pesos, yen, whatever currency, it has some sort of value
797180	801520	in the monetary universe, whether it does to you specifically or not, it does have value
801520	802520	in the universe.
802520	804180	I mean, PayPal has Bitcoin now.
804180	806960	So it's it's something you can get value out of.
806960	807960	Right.
807960	812160	But but entities are kind of a gray area as well, because there's been so many scams recently
812160	818480	with those and like necessarily Bitcoin, but like other crypto currencies, there's been
818480	819480	right.
819480	820900	So many pump and dump schemes.
820900	821900	And here's the thing.
821900	827240	Like, as far as like the real world currency and games, Diablo three should and what it
827240	831560	originally was and why it had so many issues in the beginning with the real money access.
831560	837160	That should be informing everybody that gaming is not the place for this.
837160	840640	And like everybody wants to put a get rich, quick scheme in gaming.
840640	843160	Diablo three showed ain't going to happen.
843160	845720	And like, I know people think, oh, this is different.
845720	846720	This is different.
846720	847720	No, no, no.
847720	852360	The problem is you're always going to have way too much supply and not enough demand,
852360	853640	period.
853640	858000	Because what's going to happen is that if it turns out you can earn even the slightest
858000	864880	amount of Bitcoin, you're going to have other places throughout the world that have very
864880	870160	questionable labor practices that are going to force people to play these games over and
870160	874480	over and over again to get these items to sell to those few people that are going to
874480	875600	buy them.
875600	879960	And I don't think that they're giving away Bitcoin in that sense, where it's like an
879960	880960	unlimited supply.
880960	885560	I think it's more of like kind of an incentive, like a contest, even the auction house, even
885560	886560	the contest.
886560	888880	They'll dump as many entries in the contest as they can.
888880	892320	Even the auction house, they'll spam as much in that auction house as they can for those
892320	893800	few people that can buy.
893800	896320	Nobody ever made money off that auction house.
896320	898200	It was.
898200	899200	That's why it went away.
899200	900440	It was money after that.
900440	901560	I made a quarter.
901560	902640	I made a quarter.
902640	905680	And I don't even know how I did that, to be quite honest.
905680	909280	More on steam than anything selling trading cards.
909280	914600	And now, as far as the NFT thing goes, I'm still trying to write like I get Bitcoin,
914600	919120	I get question mark Bitcoin, I get Ethereum and all this other knockoff.
919120	924400	I shouldn't call them knockoffs, but I'm sorry to me, they just get all the same to me.
924400	926720	So I get that.
926720	930240	I'm still trying to wrap my head around what NFT like really is like.
930240	933960	I guess it's like a digital type, like it's like an ownership token of some sort.
933960	939240	Yeah, it's a digital good that you have ownership that you can basically it's like your certificate
939240	940240	of authentication.
940240	941240	OK, everything.
941240	944200	So so here's I do think I actually get that.
944200	945880	And here's the wild thing.
945880	947560	This comes in the same week.
947560	950600	And I'm going to go down a dead by daylight rabbit hole.
950600	954140	But it absolutely relates to this whole story.
954140	956240	And Dark Soccer, you're going to know this one, too.
956240	960480	It has to do with the pinhead voice lines that were going to be in the game.
960480	963640	You open the box and I came and I came.
963640	968880	Did you hear the story about why those got removed and what apparently that's all about?
969200	974560	A bit of it, yeah, that there was something like they wanted to bring it back in via NFT.
974560	981600	Yes, the license holders to that whole thing wanted to create like a Hellraiser pinhead
981600	987400	NFT that would get you access to pinhead in all these other things.
987400	990200	It would be like a pinhead unlock in all these other things.
990200	995580	And it would allow the voice dialog to be there in dead by daylight and I guess other
995580	998280	types of interactions and other games.
998880	1001760	I'm not sure fucking pinhead is worth that.
1001760	1006480	I think Waluigi could get that judging off the past two weeks on the Internet.
1006480	1008520	But I don't think it had to be late.
1008520	1008920	Sorry.
1008920	1013840	Flea says that DBD released a statement that the NFT story was a fake.
1013840	1014360	Thank you.
1014360	1015280	Thank you, Flea.
1015280	1020760	OK, I apologize for being the Fox News video game podcast right here, but it is what it is.
1020760	1022760	That story was going around.
1022760	1028080	However, OK, so thank you, Flea, for debunking the story, because that whole thing was ridiculous anyway.
1028080	1037480	But I still say that is still something people are looking for in gaming, even if it's not
1037480	1044080	true in that case, some crypto and again, I'm going to get here's the thing.
1044080	1048880	If you're going to email me explaining to me why I'm wrong, you better do it like I'm
1048880	1051040	a five year old when it comes to this stuff.
1051040	1055400	And you need to understand part of the reason why NFTs are not like the big thing right
1055400	1057720	now is because most people don't fucking understand them.
1057720	1060160	So if you're going to email me and yell at me why I'm wrong, you're going to need to
1060160	1062600	explain like I'm five.
1062600	1063600	Why I'm wrong.
1063600	1070200	OK, here's the whole thing is that I think some people want that to kind of be gaming,
1070200	1072560	like you buy these like unlock keys and stuff.
1072560	1075280	I'm not sure the consumer really wants that.
1075280	1076920	I'm really not.
1076920	1081120	Mirror Muse in chat says NFT and crypto sound like Beanie Babies at best and pyramid schemes
1081120	1082600	at worst to me.
1082600	1088040	Let's see, Zen Monkey 11 says, I wish they had a pinhead Pez dispenser.
1088040	1090400	And oh, I didn't even realize they tweeted this.
1090400	1095680	So Mike Deff sent us a tweet from behavior that actually says there's been some talk
1095680	1097120	about NFTs.
1097120	1100660	When we work with our licensing partners, we provide them with in-game models as well
1100660	1101920	as chapter keys.
1101920	1102920	They are free to use these.
1102920	1107920	However, they say they see fit as the rightful owners of these characters.
1107920	1112000	To be very clear, there is no exclusive in-game content linked to these models when they are
1112000	1114280	distributed outside of the game in any way.
1114280	1115360	Oh, interesting.
1115360	1116360	So on.
1116360	1123160	Well, I got to say the way that reads to me is that maybe they were trying to like that
1123160	1130920	the Hellraiser folks are trying to bundle these DLC into key is keys and stuff, but
1130920	1133480	had nothing to do with the voice line dialog and why it was omitted.
1133480	1135160	So rabbit hole done.
1135160	1139280	I don't need to dwell on that too much, but I thought that was interesting.
1139280	1140280	That's for sure.
1140280	1141280	So.
1141280	1145360	Anyway, Loki, I know there's another half to the story.
1145360	1146360	Sorry.
1146360	1147360	Yes.
1147360	1152240	And so, of course, you know, Epic Games seizing the opportunity says, hey, guess what?
1152240	1155960	We're going to welcome NFT games since Steam banned them.
1155960	1156960	Cool.
1156960	1161320	You could get in trouble with the same entities that got in trouble or got Steam in trouble.
1161320	1163320	Or I should say maybe.
1163320	1165720	I don't know.
1165720	1166720	Good.
1166720	1168640	Glad there's a marketplace for them.
1168640	1174760	Didn't really need to step in and do that, but way to go, Tim Sweeney.
1174760	1178240	I don't know whether to read this into like Tim Sweeney's trying to be an edgelord, which
1178240	1179480	is usually the case.
1179480	1185520	Or this is just, OK, him acknowledging sometimes these purposes can be legitimate and we're
1185520	1187800	willing to be the playground for this.
1187800	1191760	It reads to me as him being very try hard to separate himself from Steam.
1191760	1195240	However, here's the thing.
1195240	1200640	If a game company wants to try the Diablo three auction house again, go for it.
1200640	1203520	You're going to flop, but go for it like you.
1203520	1206720	You can have the ability to do that, I guess.
1206720	1212240	But yeah, I mean, if you can't learn from history, I OK.
1212240	1215160	And it's fine, like I just I don't know it.
1215160	1221500	Whatever, like, I'm not going to be like, oh, my God, I have no strong opinion on any
1221500	1224960	of this, so it's like, cool.
1224960	1225880	Good job.
1225880	1226880	Pat yourself on the back.
1226880	1231480	Like, I'm not going to use one storefront over the other because of this or that.
1231480	1232480	I mean, it's just.
1232480	1238600	Tim Sweeney, can we please like get some actual features like, you know, a shopping cart in
1238600	1242720	the store, please, instead of just, you know, supporting these games, can we can we can
1242720	1245280	you finish your storefront, please?
1245280	1249720	I would appreciate that first before, you know, making these grandos gestures saying
1249720	1253080	that we're going to accept these types of games and not these other types of games and
1253080	1254440	whatnot.
1254440	1258600	Because let's be honest, at the end of the day, yeah, you can get the NFT games over
1258600	1259600	on Epic Games.
1259600	1267240	You can get all the pornography games on Steam, so I don't know.
1267240	1272680	I know I know where my loyalty lies, E3VL in chat says I got one hundred and fifty dollars
1272680	1276160	in the auction house and I was about to scream and ask questions, how, why?
1276160	1280160	But then E3VL follows that up saying not worth the time investment, though.
1280160	1281700	Good lucky drops.
1281740	1285540	So it it took a lot of work and a lot of luck to make the hundred and fifty bucks.
1285540	1292460	And I I honestly bet if you'd spent that time, I don't know, driving for Lyft or DoorDash
1292460	1296300	or doing freelancing types of work that you probably could have gotten that type of money
1296300	1297300	as well.
1297300	1300780	Like, and I'm not I'm not shading your life choices like, look, I tried to sell stuff
1300780	1302360	on the auction house, too.
1302360	1307260	It just to me, the demand wasn't there and it didn't make it, you know, really worth
1307260	1308260	it.
1308300	1312660	Anyway, in the interest of time, since we got a late start, I'm going to move on after
1312660	1313660	this story.
1313660	1317820	I'm not trying to write this off and hedge my bets on this will never be a thing or whatever,
1317820	1320820	but I just.
1320820	1326700	It's in my opinion, it's going to need to take a company like Nintendo embracing this
1326700	1329660	before it's going to be a thing in gaming.
1329660	1331620	And I already see it's not going to happen.
1331620	1333420	It's never going to happen.
1333420	1335700	Well, never say never.
1335700	1339620	But it's it's I'm ninety nine point nine percent.
1339620	1340620	Yeah.
1340620	1341620	Yeah.
1341620	1343820	Especially after some of the choices Nintendo's been.
1343820	1344820	Oh, yeah.
1344820	1345820	We'll get to that later.
1345820	1351340	They'll just do the Nintendo fungible tokens is what they'll have to do something stupid
1351340	1352340	like that.
1352340	1353340	But like.
1353340	1360500	No, I don't think I don't think they even understand the basics of cryptocurrency and
1360500	1362820	block chain.
1362820	1364300	That's OK, because I don't either.
1364380	1369900	All right, let's move on, which I have I have a tiny little bit of cryptocurrency.
1369900	1373300	I just bought it when all the other you know, when all that crap was going on with GameStop
1373300	1374300	and all that stuff.
1374300	1375300	I was like, oh, this would be fun.
1375300	1380020	I honestly looked at it no different than this is my Reno money that I put into it.
1380020	1381260	And I've made a little money.
1381260	1387220	I was at least according to my PayPal wallet, I've made a little money, but I'm not I wouldn't
1387220	1389660	put my I wouldn't put my life savings in it for sure.
1389660	1390660	That's for sure.
1390660	1391660	All right.
1391660	1393900	It is a fickle fickle thing, though.
1393900	1395660	Yeah, sure is.
1395660	1399380	OK, let's move on and talk about our gaming weeks and the types of things that we have
1399380	1402140	been playing this week, whether they involve Bitcoin or not.
1402140	1403580	Dark Soccer, I'll start with you.
1403580	1406100	How was your gaming week?
1406100	1410380	I played 12 hours worth of Dead by Daylight on Monday.
1410380	1411380	Yeah.
1411380	1418340	And then I played two hours of Grinding and Fantation and another hour of Dead by Daylight.
1418340	1426700	And then pinball where the night I'm flying out to Alabama, which is Thursday night, Dan
1426700	1429100	is hosting League at our house.
1429100	1430100	Oh, fun.
1430100	1435460	So pinballs have been all over the places, pinballs to the wall.
1435460	1440060	Speaking of which, I was just to say, we should acknowledge California Extreme happened this
1440060	1441060	weekend.
1441060	1442060	I know some people that went.
1442060	1444340	I just wasn't able to get over there.
1444340	1448740	Dan bought me a badge and I didn't go because I had had my covid booster last week.
1448740	1449740	Oh, gotcha.
1449740	1454300	So I was still feeling kind of crappy.
1454300	1457660	I heard it was a good time from those that went, though, like it's kind of one of those.
1457660	1458660	We missed it.
1458660	1459740	It was good to have it back sort of things.
1459740	1465140	I would have loved to go, but it was like as much as I love that show, the times I've
1465140	1469120	been, which isn't very often, it's always at like the worst times for me.
1469120	1470380	And that's nobody's fault.
1470380	1472340	That's just a scheduling thing.
1472340	1473340	It is what it is.
1473340	1476660	I'd love to go again if if it lines up on my calendar someday.
1476660	1482060	So I know there's anything else you want to share.
1482060	1483060	I like soda.
1483060	1484060	Awesome.
1484060	1488100	All right, let's say hello to Loki and his gaming week.
1488100	1495940	Yeah, so I played power washing simulator and or power wash simulator and I'm up to
1495940	1497860	the carousel level now.
1497860	1498860	Nice.
1498860	1499860	I'm trying to think.
1499860	1504820	Like a big treehouse, a helicopter.
1504820	1507620	I don't remember what else I had.
1507620	1512780	Oh, like an old like Winnebago or something like that.
1512780	1518900	But yeah, so it's still fun, though, slowly going through it, run out of things to unlock,
1518900	1521460	though, as far as like new equipment.
1521460	1525860	So that's kind of a disappointing, but I know it's still early access.
1525860	1531020	Yeah, they just did a patch that added new scenes, right?
1531020	1532020	Yeah.
1532020	1533020	Yeah.
1533020	1534420	They keep adding more and more and more levels to it.
1534420	1535420	So that's good.
1535420	1539700	I just wish they would have like there's still one more class of like power washer that you
1539700	1543940	can get, like the industrial strength one or something like that.
1543940	1545900	And that's just not available yet.
1545900	1552620	But yeah, I'm like a player that looks like about 15 hours now.
1552620	1557940	And then, of course, Minecraft playing Minecraft.
1557940	1560040	So I put out another video, right?
1560040	1565440	I put out another video, which I finally it's about a week turnaround time that time.
1565440	1568300	So and I'm already working on stuff for the next one.
1568300	1577700	So I'm trying to keep up with that, you know, the weekly pace there instead of biweekly
1577700	1580060	or even more infrequent than that.
1580060	1581980	It just depends on what I'm putting together.
1581980	1586140	There's a lot of like complicated builds and stuff that I'm doing, but I'm kind of getting
1586140	1587140	to the point now.
1587140	1590700	I've been finishing up the build I'm working on now, but I want to go back to making more
1590700	1591700	farms.
1591700	1593700	So I'm probably going to do that.
1593700	1594940	Nice.
1594940	1597580	And I know there was some Minecraft news this week, but we'll get into that in a little
1597580	1598580	bit.
1598580	1599580	Yes, there was.
1599580	1600880	All right.
1600880	1601880	My gaming week.
1601880	1605640	So I've been trying to stream a little more often after work, and some days were better
1605640	1606640	than others.
1606640	1610540	Like Monday, obviously, the power was out, but well, and I wasn't going to stream when
1610540	1612140	Darkstalker was doing a marathon anyway.
1612140	1616660	But the other days of the week, I was pretty much able to do stuff.
1616660	1622700	I streamed some more Metroid Dread, and I got as far as the fight with a very familiar
1622700	1624740	face from the Metroid series.
1624740	1628580	I guess, you know, you can read into that what you want.
1628580	1633440	And the viewers watched me lose that fight probably five or six times.
1633440	1637780	So I don't know if I just didn't have enough energy tanks or gear or something to take
1637780	1639020	on that fight.
1639020	1647080	But I will say one thing that was really holding me back, my wrist started to hurt real bad.
1647080	1650220	And those of you that were watching know that I called my stream.
1650220	1653880	I mean, I've been going for an hour and a half, two hours, which is my usual time anyway.
1653880	1657420	So I didn't feel bad about calling it what I did, but my wrist was really starting to
1657420	1658420	hurt.
1658420	1663540	And that kind of reads into my earlier feedback on Metroid Dread that although I think I liked
1663540	1669220	the game more the second time I played it because I was more set up for what to expect.
1669220	1673940	And so I was getting more out of a thrill out of those me chase sequences and so forth.
1673940	1678780	Like the controls is a major problem.
1678780	1684460	Like my wrist is hurting and like, you know, there's accessibility things that are issue
1684460	1685460	too.
1685460	1690700	Nintendo has got to address some some configurability issues with this game.
1690700	1698020	I don't know, like it's I'm probably going to play more off stream in shorter bursts
1698020	1701140	so I can, you know, give myself breaks more when I need them.
1701140	1704780	But that was very disappointing that things got to the point where I was like hurting.
1704780	1708060	E3VL says, did you play with pro controller?
1708060	1709260	Yes, I did.
1709260	1711160	The Splatoon pro controller.
1711160	1714080	Shad Starsick says, I don't know how people are holding the controllers to make their
1714080	1715080	wrists hurt.
1715080	1719140	I went through the entire game with no problems like that.
1719140	1720140	Congrats for you.
1720700	1723060	But that is not the case for me.
1723060	1724060	So I don't know.
1724060	1731460	So it's like I like the game, but that was a major downer, major downer.
1731460	1732460	But I'll play it more.
1732460	1735540	I just won't be doing it on stream anymore because I'm not I won't I'll be doing it for
1735540	1741100	like 30, 45 minutes at a time so I can give myself frequent breaks.
1741100	1743300	Shad Starsick also says, oh, you know what?
1743300	1744840	I didn't use a pro controller.
1744840	1746420	Maybe that's something to do with it.
1746420	1747420	Perhaps.
1747420	1750540	I know you play mostly handheld, so maybe that, you know, kind of because that is a
1750540	1752260	big difference in how you hold it.
1752260	1753260	Maybe that did make a difference.
1753260	1754620	I don't know.
1754620	1755620	So we'll see.
1755620	1756620	Let's see.
1756620	1760020	I did play some other stuff as well.
1760020	1765420	I also played I got into a new game this week called Dungeon Encounters.
1765420	1766620	That was interesting.
1766620	1770140	So that is the game that they showed at, I think, the last Nintendo Direct.
1770140	1774340	There was kind of a Squeenix game that came out of nowhere that was by the guy who designed
1774340	1778100	like Final Fantasy 12 and Tactics and stuff like that.
1778100	1782380	And it just came out on Steam, I think PS4 and Switch this week.
1782380	1783980	And so I played this game on stream.
1783980	1787900	It's the one where it looks like you're running around these crossword puzzles that have numbers
1787900	1790040	in them and you get into these fights.
1790040	1794060	And that is what the game is.
1794060	1798660	I played it on stream and about 30 minutes into it, I was like, oh, this game is this
1798660	1800100	game is terrible.
1800100	1801380	Like I, I don't know.
1801380	1802860	I don't know what they were thinking with this.
1802860	1807080	This is very clearly somebody's art project that's gone really, really wrong.
1807080	1810640	And that's why this is being released without much fanfare.
1810640	1814640	But by the time I got to the end of the stream, I started to just kind of notice things about
1814640	1818760	it where I was like, you know what, you know what I think this is?
1818760	1828960	I think this game is like a 1980s PC RPG, but done for a PlayStation 4 and Steam.
1828960	1832780	Like seriously, like when you look at these maps and like the whole thing is that there's
1832820	1838020	there's no artwork beyond like there's no, there's a stairs drawn that the monsters are
1838020	1839420	not drawn on the map.
1839420	1842260	Everything is represented by hexadecimal numbers.
1842260	1845980	So you have to remember two is a staircase that goes up.
1845980	1848600	One is a staircase that goes down.
1848600	1851840	Six is a place that can heal all your life.
1851840	1854820	Five is a place that you can resurrect everybody.
1854820	1860760	Now that really reminds me of, I'm, I'm talking to go way back to 80s PC gaming.
1860800	1867000	I'm not talking about rogue likes, I'm talking about fucking Rogue, the original Rogue.
1867000	1870320	Anybody ever play Rogue on the PC or whatever it was on?
1870320	1871320	It was ported to everything.
1871320	1872320	Ages ago.
1872320	1873320	Ages ago, right.
1873320	1877840	And in that game, like monsters were represented by letters of the alphabet.
1877840	1881280	And so like, like it's that kind of feel.
1881280	1885760	So I kind of, and it's interesting because some of the puzzles then become, okay, you
1885760	1890720	have to use these abilities to warp up a floor to where you were to get to this section.
1890720	1895080	That maybe you weren't able to reach before these, that they are puzzles that are straight
1895080	1901120	out of like Ultima and those games that were big back in the day then.
1901120	1903840	Bobby Blackpool says, did you do a steam refund for it?
1903840	1908080	I thought about it, but I didn't because I let the viewers vote if they wanted to see
1908080	1909120	it again.
1909120	1911480	And yes, overwhelmingly won.
1911480	1915560	So there's that, but also just the fact that by the end of it, I was kind of getting a
1915560	1920000	little more into it, but I think the game extremely has its shortcomings.
1920000	1922160	I'm willing to kind of see the puzzles through.
1922160	1929120	I can deal with a retro inspired game and things like that, but, um, I, I'm just not
1929120	1933400	sure why they felt getting rid of art direction altogether.
1933400	1938600	Well, I guess I shouldn't say that because I mean, they did design still pictures of
1938600	1939600	characters.
1939600	1940600	I mean, it's very minimal.
1940600	1941600	This game is very minimalist.
1941600	1945940	And I said that word a lot on the stream was a real choice for this game.
1945940	1952680	I'm telling you, if they had taken this same game and use that same engine that they're
1952680	1957400	using for Bravely default, and now the triangle strategy game, whatever that is, if they'd
1957400	1962300	use that same engine, they'd actually drawn assets instead of numbers for some of those
1962300	1966340	things, but use the same maps and dungeons made the battles work the same because the
1966340	1970140	battle system is interesting because you have like a physical defense shield and a magical
1970140	1972660	defense shield, and then you have the HP underneath that.
1972660	1975920	So you have to crack through one of the shields before you get to the health.
1975920	1977100	It's an interesting mechanic.
1977100	1983900	All they had to do was use like the, um, Octopath traveler interface and that whole thing for
1983900	1984900	that.
1984900	1989100	And I honestly think they would have had a hit on their hands.
1989100	1996740	I don't know why they decided to keep this minimalist eighties RPG in auto PlayStation
1996740	1998580	four type of thing.
1998580	2000060	Was it worth $30?
2000060	2003900	No, I don't think so.
2004200	2007560	I know there's going to, I know there's going to be people, I, the thing is this game is
2007560	2012800	going to have it's dedicated fans, but I think most people aren't going to get it.
2012800	2015920	I barely get it.
2015920	2019160	So I just, I think it's on four.
2019160	2024260	I think, again, I think I just told you how this game could have been like 10 times better
2024260	2029280	is to take down some of those minimalist walls and adapt an engine that you've already been
2029280	2033500	using on other projects and play it to this vision of how the battle should run and things
2033500	2034500	like that.
2034500	2036200	And I think you would have had a hit on your hands.
2036200	2038200	Oh, well.
2038200	2041040	Anyway, um, let's see.
2041040	2044720	Um, other games I played this week, I guess I streamed a little bit of dead by daylight
2044720	2045760	on Friday.
2045760	2048120	I've decided I'm retired from cookie clicker.
2048120	2049360	I have clicked all the cookies.
2049360	2050360	I will click.
2050360	2051360	Yes, I'm done.
2051360	2056120	I'm done because I've hit the point where it's like, I've gotten every, every, except
2056120	2059560	for one heavenly Ascension talent, which most people will play a game.
2059560	2062840	Don't even know what the fuck that is, but that's when you ascend by getting so many
2062840	2064220	cookies and start the game over.
2064220	2065580	You get talents that roll over.
2065580	2070260	I have all of them except for one, which is a very specific hard to do thing that I just
2070260	2072000	don't feel like doing.
2072000	2077780	And for those that know cookie clicker, it's the one where you ascend the chips as 777777.
2077780	2081620	You have to have all six of the last digit sevens, uh, to get the last one.
2081620	2082620	I got the other two.
2082620	2084020	That's just seven and seven, seven, seven.
2084020	2085860	And the 777 one was annoying enough.
2085860	2087020	I didn't want to do the other one.
2087020	2088780	Yes, I know you sell your buildings.
2088780	2089780	So you go slower.
2089780	2090780	Did I know how to do it?
2091000	2092840	I just don't want to do it.
2092840	2095860	And I'm not going to do something in a video game I don't want to do.
2095860	2098360	So I've decided to retire from the cookies.
2098360	2102500	I got like 430 something achievements in that game.
2102500	2103500	I'm good.
2103500	2106000	I'm, I'm never going to get that many achievements in a video game.
2106000	2109240	One other game I played a little bit of this week, Diablo two resurrected.
2109240	2112280	So I did finally pick that up and I've put a little time into that.
2112280	2117280	And that, so it's interesting because that is a old, old school at this point, right?
2117280	2119920	From like the late nineties, uh, RPG.
2119920	2125580	And so some of those elements haven't aged well, especially the quality of life stuff.
2125580	2130740	But with that one, especially with the nicer graphics and everything looks really sharp
2130740	2133240	and I'm actually enjoying it.
2133240	2137280	Even though I'm like, God, it's a pain in the ass to keep going back to town and stuff.
2137280	2138880	It doesn't bother me.
2138880	2140220	Like I'm actually kind of enjoying it.
2140220	2144300	And I think they did a really good job with that.
2144300	2147140	Bobby Black Wolf in chat says, grandma is sad, Rob.
2147140	2149560	Well, the aliens ate her.
2149560	2150560	Spoiler alert.
2150560	2151560	All right.
2151560	2154720	Uh, E3VL says, did you get login issues?
2154720	2160080	I got a queue of 17 on Saturday, but otherwise to dodge the login issues in that game for
2160080	2161080	the most.
2161080	2164800	I heard it was pretty bad, but for the, for E as of now, it hasn't really hit me yet.
2164800	2167020	So, all right, let's move on.
2167020	2168020	We got a late start tonight.
2168020	2171400	So I want to jump into some news, uh, again, housekeeping.
2171400	2175560	We will not be here live next week, Halloween.
2175560	2176720	I haven't figured out yet.
2176720	2180600	I meant to talk about this with my goes before we were live, but then the whole power out
2180600	2181600	of situation.
2181600	2184080	Is anyone else going to be here on Halloween night?
2184080	2185200	Yes.
2185200	2186200	You will be here.
2186200	2187200	It's true.
2187200	2188200	Okay.
2188200	2191200	So Jamie and I will be here that night with a show.
2191200	2195480	Uh, Loki gets the night off to spend with kids so that I just don't want to go two weeks
2195480	2196600	without a show if we can help it.
2196600	2200360	So, um, but if you want to do a segment in advance or something, Loki, we can always
2200360	2201360	do that.
2201360	2203400	So, all right, we'll see what's going on that week.
2203400	2204400	All right.
2204400	2205400	Good times.
2205400	2206400	All right.
2207080	2208080	Halloween night.
2208080	2209800	So dark soccer and I will scare you.
2209800	2215640	Maybe, maybe if we have a short show, maybe I'll let her kill me again in dead by daylight.
2215640	2216920	Cause that was kind of fun.
2216920	2219040	Dude, the kill your friends thing is fun.
2219040	2222520	Did you see my very, very, very slow, uh, piggy tea bag?
2222520	2224080	I mean, yeah, yes I did.
2224080	2227040	And that kill your friends thing was very one-sided.
2227040	2230280	It's very hard to do when there's only two survivors, but it was more about, it really
2230280	2235320	is hard with only two in that love in the corn it is for me.
2235320	2238640	It was more about just getting to throw the pallet down on you and then teabag you.
2238640	2244720	And I was satisfied because I was like, I know she's cussing me out.
2244720	2251120	I was most of the time going, Oh, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, no, Rob, no.
2251120	2252120	All right.
2252120	2254000	Uh, let's move on to some news.
2254000	2258640	So we won't be here next week while, um, dark soccer is out in Alabama and that's a very
2258640	2260360	serious thing.
2260360	2262440	I'm going to Disneyland next week.
2262440	2266560	So, um, uh, if, if they, if Disneyland hadn't gotten rid of Duffy, I would have brought
2266560	2270320	you back a Duffy, something dark soccer, but, um, I don't know.
2270320	2272320	Do you still do pins?
2272320	2277720	I do still do, do pins and you know, I love Tron stuff.
2277720	2282120	Well, so do I, so if I find it, I'll be buying it for myself, but if I find two, if Alan
2282120	2284160	does this take the Maleficent stuff.
2284160	2285160	Okay.
2285160	2286160	Fair.
2286160	2287160	Fair.
2287160	2288160	All right.
2288160	2290240	Um, I just want to see how much of the parks we can get done in a day.
2290240	2291960	So we're only going for the one day.
2291960	2297000	So I really want to ride some of the new stuff are like, yeah, I'm, I'm curious about how
2297000	2300360	that's going to feel with COVID and everything too, but I figured, you know what, if I got
2300360	2305320	through dragon con, I'll get through this and I'm vaccinated, I have no problem with
2305320	2306320	masks, whatever.
2306320	2307320	It'll be fine.
2307320	2308320	The number is a booster.
2308320	2309320	Yeah.
2309320	2313480	I want to get a, well, I want to get a booster, but at the same time I have Moderna, so we're
2313480	2314480	kind of waiting.
2314480	2315480	Yeah.
2315480	2316480	It hurts.
2316480	2317480	It still hurts.
2317480	2318480	I'm still right here.
2318480	2320120	It's still really tender.
2320120	2321400	You know what really hurts?
2321400	2322400	What?
2322400	2323400	COVID-19.
2323400	2324400	All right.
2324400	2325400	Well, duh.
2325400	2331240	But I'm still saying that this, this one hurt worse than the other, the other two.
2331240	2334360	Most people said this, the third wasn't as bad as the second.
2334360	2335360	Hmm.
2335360	2336360	Interesting.
2336360	2337360	All right.
2337360	2338920	But I also have another condition, so.
2338920	2339920	Ah, fair.
2339920	2340920	All right.
2340920	2341920	Um, let's move on.
2341920	2344080	We got some gaming news to get to as promised.
2344080	2346600	Loki is going to talk about his fave.
2346600	2347600	Minecraft.
2347600	2348600	Yes.
2348600	2349600	We're going to talk about Minecraft.
2350080	2353840	So Minecraft live 2021 was this weekend and we had lots of announcements.
2353840	2358320	So this is normally the event, normally in the past when we're not in COVID, it would
2358320	2362440	be a live event that you would be able to go to and experience everything kind of like
2362440	2367780	a fan festival, but the last few years have been just purely digital.
2367780	2370980	So they talked about, you know, new updates coming out.
2370980	2373860	Obviously we have one 18 right around the corner by the end of this year.
2373860	2378000	So they talked about some of the updates with that, just kind of showcasing, you know, some
2378000	2380640	of the changes that are becoming, which we kind of knew anyways, because they're doing
2380640	2386080	the snapshot, uh, releases, um, until the final release comes out.
2386080	2391560	Um, but then of course we got the news that the deep dark and the warden have been delayed
2391560	2395680	to one 19, but then they finally showed off what they're doing with that.
2395680	2397720	And they're really, you've expanded it out now.
2397720	2402440	So the one 19 update, which is coming out next year is going to be called the wild update.
2402440	2404940	And it adds, uh, lots of different changes to it.
2404940	2407800	One being of course, adding the deep dark to it.
2407800	2412520	The deep dark for those who don't know, is a very, very scary place that they've added
2412520	2413520	to Minecraft.
2413520	2415320	It's almost like a horror update.
2415320	2421880	Um, it's this place where there's a bunch of these like kind of growths on the ground
2421880	2427300	that are all triggered by sound and it can cause this thing that basically creates darkness.
2427300	2431120	And then the warden is this giant monster that comes out of the ground.
2431120	2434760	Um, if you make too much noise, it's very crazy.
2434760	2435760	You got it.
2435760	2439040	You got to honestly watch the trailers because the sound design that they have in there,
2439040	2441560	although the environment sounds, it's just so freaky.
2441560	2445760	Like I can't wait to play it because it, I remember when I first played Minecraft on
2445760	2450800	the Xbox 360, like when you don't know what anything is and you know, like, okay, well
2450800	2452440	creepers are going to blow up and they're going to kill me.
2452440	2455960	And I remember how like scared I really was, you know, with the creepers.
2455960	2457600	Why are we talking past tense?
2457600	2461880	That shit still scares me when I play Minecraft now and now it's not so bad.
2461880	2465480	Like, you know, like if I run across enemies, I know I'm not too worried about them, but
2465480	2469000	like before it was like, Oh my God, I got like, you got to hide in the house, you know,
2469000	2470140	through the night and stuff like that.
2470140	2473760	But now do you know what creepers need?
2473760	2475840	Creepers need the terror radius from dead by daylight.
2475840	2476840	That's what they need.
2476840	2480280	So you have that heartbeat anyway.
2480280	2481280	And the red stain.
2481280	2482280	Yes.
2482280	2486280	So, yeah, so that was on the, the announced that all the different stuff they're adding
2486280	2491400	to like the skull sensor and the skull shrieker is the one that causes the darkness and it's
2491440	2493080	the effect is just really awesome.
2493080	2498000	But outside of that, though, the wildlife is going to do some revamps for existing biomes.
2498000	2501160	So they're going to be updating the swamp biome.
2501160	2505440	With that, they're going to be adding some new biomes, including mangrove trees, which
2505440	2506920	is pretty cool.
2506920	2509480	Chest boats, frogs.
2509480	2512640	They're going to add mud into the game, which is going to be a new block.
2512640	2514560	You can make mud bricks now.
2514560	2517120	And then of course, fireflies, which would be pretty cool.
2517120	2520440	That's just some of this other time, but they're also going to be redoing the birch forest.
2520440	2523800	And I think that there's probably going to be even more biomes that they go through and
2523800	2524800	kind of overhaul.
2524800	2527200	But those are kind of the stuff that they showed off right now.
2527200	2532000	But they're trying to focus more on like the environment and bringing like the nature part
2532000	2533000	out of things.
2533000	2536280	So maybe environment sounds and whatnot.
2536280	2540120	So that was a lot of stuff that they talked about, like actual Java Minecraft in Bedrock.
2540120	2546600	Loki, but but if they're adding mud, can I get naked and wear nothing but mud?
2546600	2549680	I mean, no, you can't.
2549680	2550960	You can't wear mud.
2550960	2553000	What kind of fake ass game is this?
2553000	2555280	You can make your skin look like mud.
2555280	2557000	But yeah.
2557000	2562680	So other cool things that they announced that starting November, Games Pass is going to
2562680	2566400	have Minecraft on PC.
2566400	2571880	So that includes both the Windows 10 edition, which is Bedrock and the Java edition.
2571880	2575560	So that'll be included with Games Pass, which is pretty awesome.
2575560	2579280	Along with that, they're showing off some updates for Minecraft Dungeons.
2579280	2583480	So Minecraft Dungeons is going to get something similar to what we have in Diablo 3, where
2583480	2587040	they have like the different seasonal events that go on.
2587040	2592600	So they're going to have these seasonal adventures, as well as this Cloudy Climb and the Echoing
2592600	2596160	Void DLC, which looks interesting.
2596160	2600160	And then of course, they did the mob vote this year as well.
2600160	2604360	So they announced a few different mobs that they're going to be adding to the game.
2604440	2609560	The Alay one, which is kind of like this fairy creature thing that's able to gather items
2609560	2611440	for you.
2611440	2614520	They have like a copper golem was another one that would have been pretty cool.
2614520	2616640	It's got like a little robot thing.
2616640	2621200	And then this Alay, which looks like a flying Oscar the Grouch, which I'm not really or
2621200	2627280	not the Alay, but the the glare, which would point out where dark places are like I'd like
2627280	2631920	I need something to point out where it's dark.
2631920	2634440	So yeah, lots of big announcements.
2634440	2636000	Very excited about the updates.
2636000	2642720	Definitely go watch the trailer for the deep dark stuff because oh my God, it looks really
2642720	2646040	cool, but also really creepy.
2646040	2648600	But I'm very much looking forward to that next year.
2648600	2651880	It's nice to see that there's still quite a variety of content still being planned for
2651880	2654320	that game when you consider how old it is.
2654320	2659280	Well, you've got to see 1.18 is going to completely redesign like everything in the game.
2659440	2664720	It's going to completely redesign the caves in the game, making it very interesting and
2664720	2665720	adding a lot more features.
2665720	2668720	So that alone is going to totally change the game.
2668720	2672720	And then all these additional features are going back and kind of instead of say, OK,
2672720	2676400	well, this is a birch forest and it looks exactly like a regular forest, but there's
2676400	2681240	birch trees and they're actually making things very distinct and adding the small details
2681240	2682560	in there.
2682560	2687120	All right, well, I look forward to your videos showing them all off.
2687120	2688880	Yes, of course.
2688880	2694560	All right, moving on, let's let's talk about, OK, so another crafting game of a different
2694560	2698960	sort and one that consumed our lives last year, Animal Crossing.
2698960	2700880	And this week, pay attention to our saga.
2700880	2702600	This week we watch the whole thing.
2702600	2703600	Did you?
2703600	2704600	All right.
2704600	2709440	We had a whole direct dedicated to Animal Crossing and there is going to be one more
2709440	2710440	free update.
2710440	2711760	And they are saying this is the last one.
2711760	2716240	There's a 2.0 update coming November 5th and there's going to be some new characters coming
2716240	2717240	for.
2717240	2719120	Well, new old characters, the Animal Crossing series.
2719120	2722800	So some of the characters they kind of left out from last time are going to be added to
2722800	2724080	the game.
2724080	2728520	They're actually going to add Brewster as well, who's going to open up a not Starbucks,
2728520	2734600	but some type of coffee cafe that's at the Roost, the Roost, which is inspired from the
2734600	2738040	DS games right where that first appeared.
2738040	2739040	Right.
2739040	2741120	Also, Cap'n is coming back.
2741120	2746680	So even though there's no island to visit per se, Cap'n is still going to oh, no, I
2746680	2749240	guess he is taking you to different islands with his boat.
2749240	2750240	So I don't know what we're going to find on them.
2750240	2752800	And it has Katrina and all the other folks there.
2752800	2753800	Oh, OK.
2753800	2755240	That'll be cool.
2755240	2756320	So that's neat.
2756320	2759000	There's also going to be some more shops at Harv's Island.
2759000	2760920	That island already exists.
2760920	2763440	There will be cooking and growing vegetables.
2763440	2767780	So I think because they datamined like pumpkin and stuff in that game a long time ago, right?
2767780	2770840	So there's other vegetables that will be or squash or something that's going to be coming
2770840	2772200	to the game for that.
2772200	2777120	So that's so all that stuff they datamined forever ago finally coming to the game.
2777120	2783600	Also coming out is the only I said the first and I assume only paid DLC for Animal Crossing
2783600	2785960	is going to be Happy Home Paradise.
2785960	2790360	I, of course, instantly thought of Dark Sakura and all the time she spent playing Happy Home
2790360	2796320	Designer, because this is basically that right.
2796320	2798760	Happy Home Paradise is basically that right.
2798760	2801240	I have to pay the twenty five bucks for it.
2801240	2803720	Well, they also have it like where you can design.
2803720	2804880	It's not just homes, though.
2804880	2807800	You're doing like schools and theaters and stuff like that, too.
2807800	2808800	Yeah.
2808800	2810520	That's what it was like in Happy Home Designer, too.
2810520	2816120	You had different themes and stuff, but you also had to do that when you're designing
2816120	2823620	like you're shopping, plus the and everything to the last in the DS one.
2823620	2827960	The thing I'm most excited about are the gyroids are coming back to the game finally.
2827960	2830200	So that will get me to visit the island.
2830200	2833180	And I'm sure ketchup is going to ask me where the fuck have you been, asshole?
2833180	2834720	So we'll see.
2834720	2839160	I'm sure a lot of people are going to probably visit their town for the first time in a while
2839160	2840160	with this.
2840160	2843480	I mean, our soccer, even you kind of stop the daily grind of Animal Crossing.
2843480	2846160	But is this is this enough to get you to fire up?
2846160	2848520	No, I'm definitely going to definitely going to come back.
2848520	2852880	I think I like also that those islands that they have for captain now where you can go
2852880	2855600	there and the islands are different.
2855600	2859840	They could be different seasons or time of day, which is kind of interesting.
2859840	2863680	So you don't really necessarily time travel.
2863680	2865080	So they've got that in there as well.
2865080	2869020	Plus, they're going to have like unique stuff that you can do in there.
2869020	2872840	I like all the different like building stuff you can do there with the where you can add
2872840	2874760	permanent ladders and whatnot.
2874760	2877120	I think that's pretty cool.
2877120	2881560	Looking in chat, a fifth dream says I hate digging up gyroids, but them reacting to music
2881560	2882560	will be great.
2882560	2885920	E3VL sharing the island friend code there in chat.
2885920	2887120	I love that.
2887120	2889400	Also saying I stopped playing back in June.
2889400	2893240	Love the new content, but too much of a time commitment for me to start up again.
2893240	2896680	See a Tiberian chat says it looks like the happy home design DLC is going to permit some
2896680	2899160	additional villagers to be more permanent.
2899160	2902360	I thought that was part of the update was that more villagers because I know there's
2902360	2906220	going to be new new amiibo cards and everything to to support some of the new villagers.
2906220	2910720	So I'm not sure I have to be honest, I had to read the cliff notes because I wasn't able
2910720	2911720	to watch the thing live.
2911720	2913600	So I didn't see everything.
2913600	2916520	But Dark Saga, did you catch how the new villagers work?
2916520	2919760	Is that just villagers they're adding or are they tied to the happy home design deal?
2919760	2920840	I missed that.
2920840	2922960	I didn't see that part.
2922960	2928000	I didn't see anything about new villagers, but they did mention that you can use those
2928000	2932960	cards, I think, to invite them to come to Brewster's.
2932960	2933960	Maybe that's what it is.
2933960	2937600	Basically, they have them come join you for coffee.
2937600	2938600	But I don't know.
2938600	2939600	They didn't.
2939600	2941280	I don't think they mentioned anything about adding villagers.
2941280	2945320	The only thing they said is that they've added additional bridges so you can do a total of
2945320	2950240	10 bridges and 10 slopes now instead of eight.
2950240	2951960	And what else?
2951960	2956440	They also have that shed that you can get like a almost like a gardening shed or something
2956440	2960080	that you can access your home inventory outside your home.
2960080	2964000	You can put that anywhere in your map, which is kind of cool.
2964000	2967320	There's lots of things that they're announcing.
2967360	2971080	I mean, it's a very robust update, that's for sure.
2971080	2976360	Yeah, it's definitely it's this feels a little late in the cycle for this to come out, but
2976360	2980360	I understand Covid probably screwed a lot of stuff up, so I'm not being too critical.
2980360	2982440	Yeah, Covid, how dare you?
2982440	2987000	So but yeah, this will be a nice kind of way to wrap this all up.
2987000	2990000	And then I'm assuming they're going to move on to the next Animal Crossing game after
2990000	2991000	this.
2991000	2992000	But we'll see.
2992000	2993000	All right.
2993160	2998200	Anyway, let's move on, because there was another big thing that kind of got detailed that same
2998200	3002160	day because it goes along with that DLC that our soccer was talking about.
3002160	3003560	This is this.
3003560	3007080	This could have easily been the kickoff tonight because a lot of people talking about this,
3007080	3008560	but there's some drama.
3008560	3012520	Nintendo's been our kickoff a lot, so I have feelings about this.
3012520	3015040	Yeah, well, let's get to it.
3015080	3023000	So one of the other things that was listed was a Nintendo Switch online expansion pack.
3023000	3027120	And I'll just go ahead and go through the basics on it.
3027120	3031080	It's expanding the subscription service with a premium tier.
3031080	3038800	It's going to happen later this month, around October 25th, that it is going to have the
3038800	3046080	base service plus additional items such as a library of Nintendo 64 and Sega Genesis
3046080	3047720	games.
3047720	3055200	Individual membership will be 50 bucks, and then a family membership will be 80 bucks.
3055200	3058440	And people are like, why?
3058440	3059440	This is expensive.
3059440	3060440	Why?
3060440	3061640	And they're pretty pissed about it.
3061640	3066720	I mean, there's even like the boycott the thing and they'll be forced to lower the price.
3066720	3067760	This is Nintendo.
3067760	3068920	People are going to pay for it.
3068920	3070240	They don't care.
3070240	3071680	You can sort of call me people.
3071680	3075160	I'm not quite at the extent that you're at, but I'm very much of the mindset.
3075160	3078960	Vote with your wallet and I will be voting no on this.
3078960	3085120	Like this is, I mean, I can sort of see where folks can justify the price a little easier
3085120	3089640	if they were planning on getting this Happy Home Design DLC anyway.
3089640	3091120	I'm getting the DLC.
3091120	3092120	Yeah.
3092120	3096120	But are you going to get this super expansion pack thingy?
3096120	3101440	If the person who manages the family plan that I am a member of wants to, I will gladly
3101440	3103440	pay more for my part of it.
3103440	3105760	It's it's and it's probably a better deal on the family plan.
3105760	3108560	In fact, I know it is, but I'm not on that.
3108560	3109880	So let me let me see.
3109880	3112800	30 bucks more for up to eight users.
3112800	3120800	So keep in mind, that would roughly be for for a year of this, mind you, 10 bucks per
3120800	3125200	person for a year on a family plan.
3125280	3132560	Yeah, I'm I'm not pissed about it, but I you know, I'm not on a family plan and I don't
3132560	3134560	know. I'm on the plan with with JD.
3134560	3139080	Sure. And people could say, well, Rob, you should get on a family plan.
3139080	3141920	And I would say, y'all are game in the system anyway.
3141920	3144320	So whatever, you know, which is fine.
3144320	3147920	Which there's nothing wrong. You're working within the confines that Nintendo gave you.
3149040	3152760	But speaking as somebody who is not on one of these shared family plans or whatever, and
3152760	3157800	even if I was a Mike Defton chat says that he voted no, but the rest of the people on his
3157800	3159120	family plan voted yes.
3159120	3160800	So they're going to be upgrading to this.
3161560	3164000	I think I think this is crap.
3164480	3166600	I think this is really crap what they're doing.
3166600	3172920	I think this is this is crap to the level that like somebody in a higher up at Nintendo
3172920	3174920	ought to have their role reexamined.
3174920	3178360	This is so bad because this value is garbage.
3178600	3181600	And what's really irritating about it.
3181600	3185880	It's not even just the value that's that's because, you know, sure, you get the Happy Home
3185880	3188440	Designer DLC, you know, quote unquote free.
3188640	3190800	But this claim, though, can I finish?
3190800	3192040	Can I finish? Can I finish?
3192400	3198240	Because that is just for this year, because next year you're going to have to re up and pay
3198240	3199640	that DLC again.
3199640	3204760	You know, it's going to be like PlayStation Plus or, you know, Xbox Gold or whatever, where
3204760	3207800	once you stop paying, then you no longer have that DLC.
3207920	3212800	For most people, a year is probably enough to well experience the Happy Home Designer DLC,
3212800	3217840	whatever. But I think this whole fact that the games that they're including with the N64 and
3217840	3221440	the Genesis stuff, it's it's not up to the level to justify that cost.
3221600	3224160	And this is what really irritates me.
3224160	3225680	And fucking wait, people.
3226760	3232240	This is what's going to happen, because because the value of this higher dollar plan is so
3232240	3236000	bad, they're going to have to start to dump more into it.
3236400	3242600	And so what's now now Nintendo for no reason has created two levels of this Nintendo online
3242840	3248240	and this base plan that's been giving us Tetris 99, Mario 99 and all this stuff.
3249000	3251920	Get ready, because all that's going to go away and get.
3252160	3256040	Now, I'm not saying they're going to take away those specific games, but the future stuff
3256040	3259440	is going to go to the higher dollar plan, because that's where Nintendo wants to put the
3259440	3264320	people. Honestly, they should have just probably upped the price for everybody by 10
3264320	3268000	bucks and thrown all this in and just said, here's what we're doing to justify the price
3268000	3272400	cost. And I would probably feel a lot I wouldn't feel so much like, well, those of us that
3272400	3275280	opt to keep the base plan are going to get fucked over like I feel now.
3275560	3278800	I think this whole like two track thing is disaster in the making.
3279440	3282840	Well, and here's the problem, too, is like you raise the price, you're going to raise the
3282840	3284240	expectations of that service.
3284240	3289040	A lot of people have been kind of letting them get letting it slide when it comes to poor
3289040	3293240	performance on this Nintendo online because, well, it's only 20 bucks a year, you know,
3293240	3298440	whatever, you know, but now that it's it's comparable to the other services now that level
3298440	3300160	of expectations can be higher, too.
3300240	3305920	And I'm sorry, like, yeah, I get it that your Nintendo 64 games are pretty cool, but you
3305920	3310920	know what, though, like I'm getting sixty dollar free games or games that were like, you
3310920	3313400	know, triple-A quality games that are recent.
3314480	3318880	To a month, at least with these services, these other services I'm paying for, like.
3319880	3325600	You know how Nintendo has not shown that they can put out games on a consistent basis within
3325600	3331600	those online collections, it's just and it's really scraping the bottom of the barrel
3331600	3332320	sometimes of that.
3333000	3335320	OK, yeah, Super Mario 64 is a great game.
3335360	3336040	Well, you know what?
3336040	3341480	You sold Super Mario 64, then you stop selling it on purpose so that you could then raise
3341480	3342400	the price on this.
3342800	3345520	Like, it's just it's absolutely stupid.
3345520	3349400	I'm just not interested in in ponying up for this new scheme, and I know I'm going to
3349400	3353560	regret it probably down the road, but like the reality is, well, I mean, I can always buy
3353560	3355760	it later, I guess there's nothing to make me get it right now.
3355760	3358560	Certainly there's nothing and maybe that's exactly what it is.
3358600	3362480	There's nothing motivating for me right now on October 25th to upgrade to this.
3362520	3363400	So I'm not going to.
3363440	3364480	I'm not upgrading.
3364480	3367960	And the only thing I'm doing is I'll buy the DLC, but that's it.
3368000	3372480	I mean, I'm not going to upgrade, which is yeah, which is fine.
3373480	3376280	I'll do it if the person who manages our family plan does it.
3376800	3383600	And the other thing with all this, too, is that, you know, PlayStation Plus, Xbox Gold are
3383600	3385440	ten dollars more a year.
3385680	3390960	And what Xbox Gold gives four free games a month, PlayStation Plus two, at least three.
3390960	3393480	And again, like you said, the sixty dollar games are being included with that.
3393680	3396480	And Nintendo's response is to give fucking happy home designer.
3396800	3397800	Sorry, Jamie.
3397800	3402160	But, you know, it's just it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's
3402160	3404560	you know, it's not enough for that.
3405000	3407080	It's not enough for that type of fee.
3407200	3409560	And the 90s hang court right out regardless.
3409800	3414720	What if like like God forbid, like I know Animal Crossing is a popular game, but not
3414720	3417600	every single person that has a switch has Animal Crossing.
3417840	3421440	So let's just say like you don't play Animal Crossing because that's just not your cup
3421440	3424000	of tea. Maybe you're more of a smash player or something like that.
3424360	3428440	What is really like so you're really not getting a value proposition with that because
3428440	3429920	it's like, well, you know.
3431120	3435600	I still I'm not really getting anything I'm getting DLC, so hopefully they'll want me
3435600	3440720	to buy the game now so I can play with this DLC like I just don't I don't know, it's
3440720	3446160	such a tough sell because it's more than double the current price for Nintendo 64 games.
3446200	3448800	I'm sorry that like we've played them to death.
3448800	3449880	We've played them so many times.
3449880	3453120	We've bought them so many times through the Wii shops and stuff like that.
3453400	3458360	Like. Why can't I play my old games they purchase, you know, like I can still play old
3458360	3463880	Xbox 360, Xbox Live arcade games if they're supported on the Xbox one, I can still play
3463880	3468920	a lot of those. Like I just it's so stupid that you have to keep rebutting your stuff.
3470960	3476840	At the end of the day, Nintendo's counting on the hardcore to fund them, and I think
3476840	3477760	that's how it's going to go.
3478400	3483720	And I'm I'm going to just beg everybody to really ask yourself if this is worth it.
3483720	3490160	And look, I can understand that, yes, Mario Kart 64 online and Sin and Punishment and
3490160	3491960	all that is going to be worth it to some people.
3491960	3496520	If that's you go off, nobody nobody but you should get to dictate how your money is
3496520	3501960	spent. But for me, I'm very disappointed in this as a Nintendo fan and somebody who
3501960	3504360	usually defends them on this program.
3504360	3508200	I think it's so interesting because after that last direct, I was so hyped.
3508200	3510200	I'm like, that's the best direct Nintendo's ever done.
3510200	3513200	I'm so hyped. And then this happens and I'm like, wow.
3513800	3516480	Not to go back to Dead by Daylight, but I'm going to.
3516480	3520720	And you know that opening movie where Dwight's running down the stairs and then he
3520720	3523640	trips on the stair and eat shit and then pinhead chains him to the wall.
3523840	3526080	That is how I'm feeling about Nintendo right now.
3526080	3531600	And here's the ironic thing about this whole thing is if they had just done this instead
3531600	3536120	of a subscription model like they're doing now and just opened up an e-shop where we
3536120	3540000	could just purchase these piecemeal, they would probably make more money than they're
3540000	3541720	going to make off of these subscriptions.
3542440	3546280	Like it's funny, it's funny, and I already know Bobby's typing this comment in chat and
3546280	3549960	probably some other people, too, is that when when it was like that, then everybody asked
3549960	3551360	them to be the Netflix of gaming.
3551600	3557880	Here's here's the problem is that everybody's looking at it and now going Nintendo, you
3557880	3561960	have this gigantic fucking catalog and you're piecemealing it like this.
3561960	3565880	When people wanted Netflix for games, they didn't want.
3565880	3575000	These like small, they wanted your whole catalog, they want the game pass and that's
3575000	3575680	that's what they wanted.
3575680	3578920	But then now that tells like, well, yeah, we could do that, but it's going to be fifty
3578920	3580120	dollars a year.
3581440	3585520	Which I think if they brought it down by month and like it may not be such a big deal,
3585520	3591760	but like it's still I don't know, it's just it's still very clunky, it's it really should
3591760	3597600	all be like like I shouldn't have to have separate apps for Nintendo, Super Nintendo,
3597600	3599360	Genesis, Nintendo 64.
3599440	3602400	It should just be one giant like collection.
3602800	3604120	That's how they should really do it.
3604120	3608760	And it should be also just like why isn't there Game Boy games yet?
3608800	3613280	Why isn't there like, you know, stuff that we know that they could like Game Boy, Game
3613280	3616360	Boy Advance, like they could do all this stuff easy.
3616560	3618440	It's the 3DS could do it.
3618440	3619240	Come on.
3619240	3621040	Like that's easy stuff.
3621040	3622720	Just put it out in there.
3622720	3623440	I don't.
3624560	3626280	That's probably next year, I guess.
3626800	3631840	Pixel Pacas in chat says, I love N64 and still have a console plus games, but still wanted
3631840	3635760	to opt into this for very quick and easy access to key N64 games.
3636040	3638920	But I won't be upgrading my online membership at this price point.
3639320	3641920	ZenMonkey11 in chat says Nintendo knows what they're doing.
3641920	3643800	They like to do things right and thorough.
3644160	3647720	All I'm going to say is that the Wii U called and said hello.
3647720	3649840	The Wii Vitality sensor called and said hello.
3650160	3654360	Look, Nintendo is the best game maker in the business that I'm not never going to argue
3654360	3657240	that point, but they don't always make winning decisions.
3657240	3658720	And in my opinion, this is one of them.
3658720	3660280	That's not a winning decision.
3660280	3661240	And that's my opinion.
3662720	3665200	Here's one of the thing that I want to say on this whole thing before we get to the next
3665200	3668680	story, and that is that whole and I'm sure you guys have seen this, that whole, quote
3668680	3669480	unquote, rumor.
3669480	3673440	But it comes from that source that's gotten a lot of Nintendo things right before.
3673600	3675560	So Nintendo is more apt to believe her.
3675720	3681560	And the whole thing that it's apparently the third party licensing that is driving this
3681560	3682560	cost so high.
3682560	3686640	So namely, Sega Genesis is what's driving this cost so high.
3686800	3688440	And I'm sitting here going.
3690000	3696480	That that is that makes a bad thing even worse, they paid that much for Sega Genesis
3696480	3699600	stuff, and I'm not knocking the Genesis.
3699800	3701160	It's an important console.
3701160	3702160	It's a great thing.
3702880	3704320	It's everywhere else.
3705960	3710960	Except the Wii U, which this rumor said Sega didn't play up on the Wii U because they
3710960	3715960	were disappointed in what little sales there were on the Wii and that it wasn't really
3715960	3717800	advertised and backed very well.
3718040	3722880	But I'm sorry, we all know of that Genesis collection that's available on every other
3722880	3723560	platform.
3723680	3729080	We know that Sega has no problem releasing their back catalog on like Steam and all
3729080	3730280	sorts of other places.
3730440	3732840	Those games, very easy to come by.
3732920	3736880	I mean, I guess you could even Castlevania Bloodlines was in that Castlevania collection.
3737000	3738120	They just did not that long ago.
3738120	3738960	What's what's left?
3739080	3740000	Contra hardcore?
3740000	3741440	That was in the Contra collection.
3741560	3742280	What's left?
3742640	3748200	Like there's maybe one or two Genesis games in there that aren't really easily accessible
3748200	3748800	somewhere else.
3749240	3755280	And so whoever if that is true and it's a big if and I understand this person's gotten
3755280	3757760	a lot right before, but I bet they've gotten along wrong, too.
3757760	3765200	If this is true, that was that was the worst call in the whole thing.
3765960	3771360	Who thought that was a good idea to drive the cost up that high to get the Sega fucking
3771360	3776560	Genesis on the Switch when it is literally everywhere else?
3777240	3778960	They could have polled people, too.
3778960	3780400	I mean, there also is that.
3783360	3787160	Yeah, I guess I but again, I don't understand why that and why not.
3787360	3788280	Oh, I don't know.
3788480	3792400	Do a Gameboy color that has the Pokemon games in it.
3792640	3797480	Jesus, that that a lot like if it's just like all the old school Pokemon games.
3798200	3798880	Oh, my God.
3798880	3801840	People would people would have paid the higher fee for just that.
3804600	3808720	Shane, no, I'm just kidding, other people, especially if it had the Pokemon bank
3808720	3810240	functionality, you know.
3812400	3815000	Johnny Woo face says would rather had GameCube over Genesis.
3815520	3818720	As you know, Matt says there are like 10 different Sega collections with those games
3818720	3819880	out there. Exactly.
3820080	3822200	So, again, that is a rumor.
3822200	3826840	I don't want to say like that is the way it is, but it's coming from a source that's been
3826840	3829160	right before. So people are really paying attention to it.
3830120	3835840	And as I say, if that is true, somebody at Nintendo should be having their job examined
3835840	3840080	this week. Quite frankly, that that was the worst business decision somebody could have
3840080	3846560	possibly made that it shows a complete lack of awareness of what is happening in the
3846560	3853200	industry. If you're Sega, somebody should get a promotion over at Sega for making that
3853200	3856880	deal. So because you fucking took him to the cleaners.
3856920	3863880	Good job. Once again, Sega ahead of the curve and ahead of its time.
3865520	3867920	All right, let's move on.
3870320	3873640	Mike Deff says a co-host of mine said they should have just bought Saturn games since a
3873640	3875320	lot of people miss those. Yes.
3875480	3879960	Yeah. Or if it had been the Dreamcast, can you fucking imagine people would have lost
3879960	3885360	their shit? So if if that's the long term plan with Sega.
3886640	3891240	Then I will eat my words and I'm not going to say I'm going to eat my hat or something
3891240	3895800	because I'll have to chow down on it eventually, possibly, but I will eat my words and
3895800	3897160	pony up for one of these subscriptions.
3897200	3903000	Absolutely. If that's the long term plan, then that person at Nintendo can keep their
3903000	3904600	job because that's a very smart plan.
3904800	3907600	But if Genesis is the only thing that was in the plan, that was stupid.
3907960	3913280	But if the plan involves Dreamcast in six months time or something, Saturn, then OK,
3913320	3914400	good job. You did it.
3914640	3918120	You did the thing. You probably should have dropped a hint around now to get people more
3918120	3919800	excited. But whatever, whatever.
3920560	3922920	All right, let's move on. We're running behind us.
3922920	3925120	It is. So I want to get to the next story, which is Loki's.
3926120	3929720	So we talked about how there's been all these rumors about the Grand Theft Auto trilogy.
3929760	3933840	Well, it's even more I mean, they've officially announced that it is coming, but we still
3933840	3935920	don't know exactly what exactly it is.
3936120	3942480	However, there's been things found on Deep Within Rockstar's website that kind of it's a
3942480	3946680	description of it. So they basically said three iconic cities, three epic stories.
3946880	3953040	It's going to have the higher resolution textures increase, draw distance, environmental
3953080	3959600	upgrades, Grand Theft Auto five style controls and targeting, which is definitely a huge
3959680	3963520	upgrade from what was available on the PlayStation one eras.
3964880	3967840	All right. Yeah, back when those games originally came out.
3969560	3971160	So it sounds interesting.
3971160	3976760	I don't know necessarily when it's coming out yet, but apparently there's going to be
3976760	3980240	some sort of ten dollar discount or something.
3980240	3984440	If you buy it, you get a discount on other rockstar games or something like that.
3984760	3989200	So probably later on this year, we'll have to see what exactly it is.
3989840	3992160	I'm keeping my expectations low, though.
3994520	3996000	As the Grand Theft Auto fan.
3997640	3998880	Yeah, well.
4000240	4004080	I don't know, I played those so many times, though, I played San Andreas and three and
4004080	4005680	Vice City so many times.
4005680	4008840	I get it, I get it, but it's just like I can't imagine.
4009840	4012960	It's going to be that great, but whatever, we'll check it out.
4014080	4018840	All right, speaking of things I can't imagine are going to be that great, let's talk about
4018840	4021240	the return of G4 to television.
4021480	4028440	So finally, after all this time, we have found out that G4 will be returning to cable
4028440	4033040	television. It is not as I thought it was going to be something that was going to be
4033040	4036400	leveraged for the Peacock service, which would have made a lot of sense.
4036640	4038480	But they are going back to traditional cable.
4038480	4039840	So, hey, I mean, congrats.
4039840	4046600	That's a win. It is going to launch November 16th on Xfinity TV, Cox and Verizon Fios.
4047280	4051560	So that's interesting. You can also stream the network on Filo as well.
4052400	4056560	G4 has supposedly made some type of promotional and commercial deal with Twitch.
4057040	4060200	I'm assuming that means you're going to see a lot of G4 ads as the pre-roll into other
4060200	4065560	content. And G4 will continue to make dedicated social content for social media
4065560	4068600	channels that will include YouTube as well.
4068760	4072160	So they put out a whole little teaser this week that finally showed the date.
4072880	4075160	Attack of the Show and X-Play are returning.
4075160	4079320	Kevin Pereira and Adam Sessler are going to be hosting those respective shows.
4079800	4082600	No words on other hosts and their involvement right now.
4084160	4086360	ESL Esports events will be there as well.
4086920	4091720	Dungeons and Dragons playthrough with G4 talent and other celebs, I guess, will be
4091720	4096840	there, too. And oh, boy, all 167 episodes of Ninja Warrior for those.
4097000	4103080	So this is very much late G4 coming back and not early G4 that many of us liked.
4103720	4105440	I'll just get XAV instead.
4106000	4106760	Is it too late?
4108200	4112760	Some of the other talent coming to G4, Alex Goldenboy Mendez.
4113880	4116640	Avilimay, I've never heard of any of these people.
4117160	4122040	Indiana Froskrin Black, YouTube creators Kasim G.
4122040	4125920	Gerard, The Completionist Khalil and Gina Darling.
4126400	4132880	Twitch streamers Fiona Nova and Will Neff and WWE Xavier Woods, aka Austin Creed.
4132880	4133920	OK, I've heard of that one.
4134000	4136200	The rest I've heard of the wrestler.
4136200	4139960	I can't fucking believe we're here at this point, but OK, I guess this is where I'm
4139960	4143360	just old, out of touch grandpa of Bahmani Boomer.
4143360	4145080	I forgot we all got titles last week.
4145280	4150080	Old, out of touch Bahmani Boomer, who doesn't know any of these other new names.
4150440	4153440	So anyway, G4 is coming back.
4154280	4157240	Anyone have anything to say, anything to say about that?
4159200	4160520	I'll wave a little flag.
4161960	4167040	I'm going to surprise that they don't go like I get it because it's a cable, like a
4167040	4170200	cable channel and they want you to subscribe to it, which I won't be doing.
4171200	4176200	But I am kind of disappointed that they're not within this century and streaming online
4176200	4179880	as well, like on like Twitch or something like that.
4180320	4183160	But whatever, I guess.
4185320	4187920	Let's see, Mike Deft says, I do follow The Completionist.
4187920	4189160	Good guy. All right. I trust you.
4189160	4190360	I trust your feedback, Mike Deft.
4191080	4193160	Let's see. Critical Myth says, this sounds terrible.
4193160	4198800	Yeah, I mean, I will continue to not watch it like every other cable network.
4198800	4200120	I don't watch cable TV anymore.
4200200	4203560	This little thing called Twitch came along and I can watch my friends play video games
4203560	4205760	and talk to them and chat and be a little bit social.
4205760	4207440	And that's kind of what I do.
4207560	4210000	And in my opinion, that's G4's biggest competitor.
4210120	4212680	So I guess they're smart to team up with Twitch a little bit.
4212680	4217480	But yeah, Bobby Black Wolf says, but are they streaming like they're on traditional
4217480	4218760	cable in a streaming service?
4218960	4220600	It's just not a streaming service you have.
4220600	4222120	It's on that Phylos or whatever.
4222120	4223800	So cool.
4223800	4227720	Yeah, Phylo you can do like through like smart TV and stuff.
4227720	4232600	I've watched a little bit of the Hell's Kitchen uncensored channel.
4233000	4235680	I watched a lot of the RuPaul's Drag Race channel and that was a thing.
4235680	4236640	But they got rid of that.
4236880	4239800	And then I watched some of the Survivor channel that shows that the old ass episode
4239800	4241160	survivor on Pluto TV.
4241400	4245280	That's about that's about the most channel stuff I've watched on those free streaming
4245280	4247040	services. Oh, I take that back.
4247600	4252000	My TV has something built into it.
4252000	4253720	What's Samsung's streaming service?
4253920	4256800	The Samsung TVs have something built into it and they have a game show channel.
4256800	4257800	And I do watch that.
4258520	4260560	I forgot about that. So I will I'll give you that.
4261160	4264480	Pluto's fun when they've got because they have the dedicated Mr.
4264480	4266880	Sans here, three thousand channels, which are always fun.
4269080	4271640	OK, Mike Deff says smart TV, I have it too, so.
4271640	4274560	All right. Anyway, let's move on.
4274560	4276520	I think we're to Dark Sakura.
4277440	4286720	Are we? Well, you know, I am a big fan of of the analog company and a lot of the
4287040	4290840	things that they put out and I really do want one of these just they're expensive.
4291920	4296800	The analog pocket that's supposed to play all these delightful things.
4297640	4302440	It's getting its own operating system when it launches and it is going to launch later
4302440	4308880	this year. Now, tell me when the freakin' analog duo is coming up, because that's what
4308880	4310960	I want more. Anyway.
4311640	4321160	They are going to come out with analog OS, which they call, quote, a definitive
4321160	4327840	scholarly operating system that lets users explore, discover and play through all of
4327840	4329120	video game history.
4329760	4336520	It is a fairly minimalist operating system to which I'm rather pleased about, but it
4336520	4343240	has its library that has a database that was built by the group at Analog that shows
4343240	4348920	a system by system, game by game, region by region, developer by developer, publisher
4348920	4356000	by publisher, revision by revision, a complete and total history of video games.
4357000	4363680	And that, I have to say, it's it's gorgeous.
4364400	4369440	I like it. And on top of that, I mean, some of the other things, too, is that you can
4369440	4373960	organize your your games and create gaming playlists.
4375920	4378440	That and you can share your playlist with other people.
4379440	4385760	And you can track when you play, it's got like all kinds of other other interesting
4385760	4397360	tools in it with a nice OLED display, but that the OS is it looks really, really beautiful.
4397640	4405480	You know me, I like something that's clean looking that that's just simple and easy to
4405960	4411840	pick up. But the fact that it's got so much gaming history attached to it is honestly
4411840	4414600	it's what I really, really am excited for.
4415320	4418400	I, I more and more want one of these things.
4420760	4427240	Plus, it has dark mode and you have like classic screen modes and all kinds of different
4427240	4431360	features for the different systems that are portrayed in the gaming.
4431360	4434960	And I'm absolutely delighted by this.
4437080	4441480	Yeah, it looks really neat, like I kind of want to get one of these, too, just because it
4441480	4443520	looks like such a great way to kind of play the old games.
4443760	4448280	They have a very strong kind of like anti ROM stance, too, like they're very much like
4448280	4450200	this is for cartridges, not for ROM.
4450200	4455160	Well, I think they're just saying that the the they're just trying to clarify that the OS
4455160	4456920	is not allowing you to pirate stuff.
4457480	4460520	The system is meant to be like a physical, you know.
4462080	4465880	Physical game device, but like the fact that it plays HuCards.
4467400	4470000	And I think it plays both varieties of HuCards.
4471320	4474880	I mean, my Turbo Express is kind of beat.
4475120	4478480	It would be nice to to have something like this.
4478680	4482800	Yeah. Plus, you could always get like a never drive or something like that if you
4482800	4484280	wanted to load your own ROMs and.
4485120	4486520	Yeah.
4487480	4490960	All right, well, moving on a few more stories here before we get to the classic game of
4490960	4491880	the week, but first.
4493120	4493520	Loki.
4495400	4501760	So Epic has finally admitted what we've already all known since the absolute beginning of
4501760	4509720	time that, yes, Fortnite's imposter mode might have been inspired by Among Us.
4509720	4512880	It may have been, you know, a little bit.
4514280	4521760	So, yeah, basically said that, you know, in their, I guess, update notes or whatever,
4521760	4528480	they said, you know, version 18.20 brings improvements to imposters, the game mode
4528480	4531240	inspired by Among Us from Intersloth.
4532360	4535400	So they do mention that, you know, they finally do credit them.
4535760	4540160	Of course, you know, Intersloth said, you know, hey, we didn't really necessarily we
4540160	4544160	didn't patent the mechanics for Among Us because they don't think it's healthy for the
4544160	4545640	game industry to do that.
4546960	4551280	And I think the thought is that there's going to be some sort of maybe crossover between
4551280	4555800	Among Us and Fortnite that they're going to do something with that maybe.
4555840	4559600	And that's why now they're kind of shaking hands and, you know.
4561080	4566720	So among us team, don't sell out, don't do it, don't.
4568560	4573360	So we'll see, but thank you, Epic, for doing the bare minimum.
4575160	4578720	I think you're right, right, though, that it could be leading to something bigger, but
4578720	4579200	we'll see.
4579920	4580360	All right.
4580360	4581840	I mean, yeah, it's.
4584840	4589040	Well, moving on to before we get to the classic game of the week, obviously, a lot of
4589040	4594920	people loving Metroid Dread, but don't run into the bug that is in the game that apparently
4594920	4599120	is really screwing people up on being able to finish the game because the title will
4599120	4603040	close out and causes an error that says the software was closed because an error
4603080	4608600	occurred. Apparently, if you destroy a door while a map marker for that door is displayed
4608600	4611640	on the map, it will crash the game, which seems a little silly.
4612160	4618320	Nintendo says if you just restart and before this happens, take off the icon door map
4618320	4621640	marker and then the error won't occur and the game can continue.
4622280	4623920	So that seems easy enough to avoid.
4623920	4626520	But Nintendo will be patching the game.
4626880	4630560	You don't often hear about Nintendo having to do bug fix patches because they come from
4630560	4632160	an era when you couldn't do that.
4632400	4634720	So but that they're doing it.
4634720	4636120	So they're going to it isn't the first time.
4636120	4639680	Obviously, we just talked about an Animal Crossing patch, so they're going to fix this
4639680	4643800	with a patch. And I think it's supposed to be a little later this month.
4643800	4646000	I think I was hearing is when they were planning to put that out.
4646000	4649120	So that'll be good for people trying to get past that.
4649120	4655760	But it is very interesting that the game launched with a bug kind of like that, that left
4655760	4658680	some folks getting their games restarted on them, which would have.
4658680	4663960	It would have made me unhappy if I ran into that, I guess I still could, but I haven't
4663960	4666280	really been using map markers, so I probably won't.
4667200	4671120	All right, I'm going to our chat before we get to our next segment.
4671360	4674280	Zen Monkey in chat says the Among Us team already sold out.
4674280	4678680	They promised an Among Us 2 and Among Us 1 going totally free and open source.
4678880	4681000	Then they saw how popular the first one got.
4681000	4683320	So they saw dollar signs and changed their roadmap.
4683840	4690360	Um, I kind of see that, but at the same time, there's a part of me that thinks that sort of
4690360	4692320	success, they they kind of earned it.
4692320	4694280	They made a cultural phenomenon type of thing.
4694440	4697320	I get the hold they were going to make it open source and then they didn't.
4697320	4699280	Kind of seems as them going back on their word.
4699600	4705080	I would guess one day this game will lose its popularity and steam and all that stuff.
4705360	4709240	And they'll probably come around and release the source code like they did with Doom, like
4709400	4714880	all the stuff to probably like depending on the success of it, because obviously like a
4714880	4718280	smaller game or something like that, they probably have no problem with like, they're
4718280	4720160	like, OK, well, we released it.
4720680	4722080	All right. Didn't really do that.
4722080	4725120	Great. OK, we'll go ahead and release the source code because why not?
4725120	4727720	We'll move on from there. And then it became a huge phenomenon.
4727720	4731400	They're like. All right, well, now we have to go a different approach.
4731400	4732480	I could see that.
4732720	4734920	Yeah, people can change their minds.
4735920	4739440	And Mike Deaf says, who's buying their official Among Us costume for Halloween?
4740440	4745240	I don't think they did not have any Among Us Halloween costumes when I went.
4745240	4747000	I haven't seen it, but I'm sure it's out there.
4748000	4753240	Now, if you want Fortnite costumes, well, there's a whole section in the store for Fortnite.
4754680	4756920	All right. Can I be sexy Fortnite?
4757880	4760840	Because that's that's a Halloween is it's sexy.
4761240	4766160	Probably. I am I'm guessing I mean, ironically, yes, I think you can.
4766160	4771600	And I swear that I have seen those like kind of posts where it's showing the stupidest
4771600	4773560	like sexy costumes that they have.
4773560	4779640	And I'm pretty sure I did see one with like the llama pinata thing as like a sexy costume.
4779640	4784520	So it was just like it's blue and purple bikinis and a llama head.
4784520	4785640	It makes no sense.
4786600	4789480	E3 Vielenchat says squid game costume this year.
4789480	4793240	But that's a sexy did not have those sexy squid game.
4793240	4798960	I'm into it. It's too soon for like the Halloween store chains to actually have those
4798960	4801200	because they manufacture the stuff way in advance.
4802200	4805120	So they did not get in on the squid game stuff this year.
4805120	4807960	Now, Amazon and all the other like shops online.
4808160	4809360	Yeah, of course, you can do that.
4810360	4813960	I'm going to do that. I'm going to do that in Rocky for Rocky in two weeks.
4813960	4815400	I'm going to do sexy squid game.
4817480	4819080	I can't wait. All right.
4819560	4821400	Anyhow, let's move on.
4821400	4824160	Are you are you going to dress up like the doll?
4824160	4825400	I already know. I already know how to.
4826000	4827200	I could dress up as the doll.
4827200	4828680	That's one way to do it. But I think what to do.
4828680	4834000	I'll wear for the top up like a tank top with the number like on it in green and then the
4834000	4838600	bottom. I'm just going to have like probably I'll just wear like green undies that come up
4838600	4843400	pretty high. Like it's you know, I'm willing to wear it on the Rocky stage, but not much
4843400	4846360	beyond that, that and then like green fishnets and green heels.
4847400	4849360	That's that's my idea for sexy squid game.
4849560	4854520	So and then then what I'll do is I'll actually like I'll have a squid for one of my arms and
4854520	4856760	I'll make jokes about the tentacles.
4856760	4857800	Anyway. All right.
4858720	4861480	Tyre class says, what if you dress up as the squid kids from Splatoon?
4861680	4865920	I don't want to bring things for kids into these costume crazy costume ideas I have.
4866040	4867960	So pass pretty.
4867960	4873240	Yeah. Bonds 006 says, Rob, my girlfriend asked if you will do sexy squid game costume on
4873240	4878240	the podcast. Oh, this this is where we I should I should hold it hostage for money.
4879000	4880680	We'll see. We'll see what kind of mood I mean.
4880800	4884480	Here's the thing. There are rules of what you can and can't do on Twitch.
4884880	4888480	So I will probably only be able to do it from the top up on Twitch.
4888480	4890040	You can't do that on Twitch a vision.
4890080	4892080	Yeah, you can't do that on Twitch a vision.
4893560	4899840	All right. Let's move on to a time when things were less sexy for Halloween.
4901720	4903640	These are pretty bad and homemade.
4909240	4918200	And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time or I'll dive into the vault and pull
4918200	4920080	out a classic and tell you about it.
4920480	4923200	It's time for the classic game of the week.
4924640	4928040	As Joe 100 Matt says, there was a time before sexy Halloween costumes.
4928040	4931120	I think so. At least there was a time when this game existed.
4931120	4933120	And it's it's not that sexy.
4933120	4934960	It's kind of loud. It's older than a lot of you.
4935040	4937440	Yes. Darcacro, what is this game that we're looking at?
4938280	4941520	The game that I picked is Monaco GP.
4941920	4943680	Now I'm going to take a step back.
4943680	4948800	A lot of people know Monaco GP as a more modern racer, but not so.
4948800	4950920	This is the original Monaco GP.
4953040	4960240	It is an arcade racing game that was released by Sega in November 1979 and came out in
4960240	4962720	North America, January 1980.
4963520	4974760	It has a very specific, special thing about it, and that is that it was the last Sega
4974760	4984840	game to use TTL based logic circuits instead of microprocessor based CPUs, transistor to
4984840	4986200	transistor logic, by the way.
4986880	5000760	It has 100 chips across two circuit boards, sprites and different images are are stored
5000760	5007440	on a small ROM chip, and then the sound effects and other things are stored.
5007920	5012560	They're actually generated by an operational amplifier and other analog circuitry.
5013080	5020840	So the scoring is done via LEDs on the cabinet, kind of old school pinball style,
5021240	5024280	including players high scores in the high score table.
5024560	5030040	And basically it's a race against the clock.
5030040	5033800	You are racing your little cars through five different areas.
5034560	5037160	You have rival cars that will get faster.
5037160	5038280	The road will narrow.
5038280	5041080	The surface changes to ice and gravel.
5042880	5049400	There are also for this arcade game, there were multiple cabinets out.
5049760	5055520	There was a deluxe cockpit cabinet that you would sit behind the steering wheel.
5055520	5058160	We had these a long time ago, y'all.
5059320	5063040	And then you also, of course, had the stand up versions.
5063040	5077920	But yeah, Monaco GP has had many a port and it really did sort of get that racing genre really big.
5077920	5084080	I mean, we also had around the same time, you know, pole positions coming out.
5084080	5091840	We had other racing games and this one was among the top three highest grossing
5091840	5097160	driving games of 1979 in Japan and the top five in 1980.
5097520	5102560	And in America, it was the top grossing driving game of 1981.
5102560	5105880	And it still remained in the Japanese charts through 83.
5107040	5109440	In the US, it remained in charts through 87.
5109440	5110920	So, I mean, look at that.
5110920	5112720	It's really, yeah.
5114240	5118720	And it's hard to find a good long play of the arcade one.
5118720	5122280	I did link another one that has better sound that's from the arcade.
5124240	5129400	But to go through it, there was an upgraded version that was pro Monaco GP that came out in 1980.
5129800	5135960	And then later on, it was ported to the SG1000 in 1983.
5136520	5147200	It also had later releases as a Super Monaco GP and Aiten Senn as a Super Monaco GP 2.
5147680	5153200	So, this one as well.
5153200	5165600	I mean, like I said, it was very well received and it's been re-released, you know, had sequels and everything.
5165600	5172720	But it even had re-released a remake, sorry, for PlayStation 2 and the Sega Aegis 2500 collection.
5173560	5179040	And it had a bunch of different add-ons, including more cars and game modes.
5179520	5188080	And the remake itself improved some of the gameplay that people were a little bit iffy about on the original.
5188480	5202240	So, I mean, there's a person from Replay, Eddie Adium, I'm going to say, I'm going to hope I pronounced it right.
5202720	5209800	That said that Monaco GP is one of the, quote, most evergreen games to come out from 1979.
5210680	5219000	And I, honestly, there's not really enough I can say about it really.
5220000	5222520	It is a fairly obvious, fairly simple game.
5222520	5226280	But this is, again, the late 70s when this came out.
5226920	5232400	And it was a fairly, I would say, involved game for its time.
5232600	5236680	Now, we might call it simple now, but this game really did a lot of stuff.
5236680	5243320	And like I said, it was one of the last old school style TTL machines that Sega put out.
5243320	5244800	So it does have that distinction.
5246080	5247200	But that's it.
5247480	5249760	I was going to say, can I tell an interesting story about this game real quick?
5250200	5251080	Let me surprise you.
5252280	5254680	So I don't know if my dad is still out there watching.
5255040	5257760	He texted a picture earlier that he was watching.
5257760	5260760	So, hi, dad, if you're out there and thanks for watching tonight.
5261640	5266200	But way back in the day, we had a Commodore 64.
5266200	5269240	And I've talked about the C64 era a lot on this show.
5269600	5275840	And one of the games that my dad found and bought for this Commodore 64 that we had was a game called Le Mans.
5277160	5285160	And I remember that game quite fondly as one of the first games I really played when I was younger on that Commodore 64,
5285160	5289720	because it used the paddle, used that unique like Atari paddle kind of.
5289880	5294400	Actually, no, it was because you could plug the Atari controllers into the Commodore 64.
5294400	5295520	I forgot that that was like a thing.
5295720	5297560	So you use the paddle controller with it.
5298040	5299120	It was this game.
5299520	5306520	It was literally the exact same thing as this game down to the nighttime levels were in that as well.
5306760	5311440	So like it was very much a clone, a rip off or whatever of this.
5311760	5316800	And I never realized, you know, because I just always thought when I saw this type of game, I was like, oh, it's Le Mans.
5317120	5320960	And I'm like, oh, my God, it was inspired by this game.
5321200	5326120	So it was like a Commodore's clone of Monaco GP, which is so crazy to me.
5326400	5330800	So, yeah, one of my first first gaming memories is that game.
5330960	5333080	And so essentially it's this.
5333200	5337560	And I'm sure the audio, sorry if the audio kind of bugs a little bit, but it is, you know, it's a late 70s game.
5337560	5342680	I didn't have a lot of great audio, but the Commodore 64 version was really no better in that regard.
5342680	5346360	You know, it was like that constant engine noise you would hear in the game.
5346360	5353160	But I think that's just so interesting how it existed in my memory as a different game.
5353160	5355720	But that was one that was, in fact, inspired by this.
5357200	5358680	So. All right.
5359480	5360600	There it is. Excellent choice.
5360600	5365440	Dark Sakura, the classic game of the week is Monaco GP by Sega.
5365440	5368440	I am glad people approve of my choice.
5368520	5369640	Yeah. All right.
5369960	5371760	It's older than a lot of you kids.
5371760	5372560	Get off my lawn.
5372560	5373680	Sure is. It's about as old as I am.
5373680	5375640	Get me my pink drink and get off my lawn.
5376360	5379560	All right. Let's get into some rapid fire news.
5379960	5381480	Let's get to it. Loki.
5382680	5391360	Yes, so apparently Epic is thinking that, well, since they have all of the Halloween costumes now, that, hey, why not?
5391360	5397920	Let's expand out into scripted video programming, in other words, movies for Fortnite.
5398360	5405200	So perhaps we'll see a Fortnite movie or a Fortnite Netflix series or something to that effect.
5405600	5407680	But it is something that they are considering.
5408280	5415360	And why not? Because it is a pop culture phenomenon and they like money.
5415800	5417720	So, of course, they're going to do that.
5418640	5421400	So we'll have to wait and see. Fun times.
5422480	5434400	And then there's also the word basically with the announcement we had last week of Kingdom Hearts coming to the Switch via cloud versions.
5434720	5439720	They were asked if, you know, there is a way to get this to run natively instead of via the cloud service.
5439720	5445120	And it's something that they're, you know, not sure they're undecided on trying to pursue.
5445120	5446440	But it is, you know.
5448160	5457800	It's not going to happen on this hardware, I'm going to tell you that right now, but we'll like to to think that, you know, maybe they'll figure out a way to do it.
5458880	5460240	I mean, they did it with The Witcher 3.
5460240	5462960	I don't know why they can't do this, but we'll see.
5465240	5466680	All right, Dark Sakura.
5468000	5474040	So there is a release date now for Gate of Nightmares.
5475560	5483360	It is going to be out, it's a JRPG done by Mashima Ahido, who is also behind Fairy Tail.
5484360	5489360	It's going to be released on October 26th for iOS and Android.
5490360	5494720	And it's looking like it's going to be pretty fun.
5494720	5497200	So, yeah, October 26, go get it.
5498400	5500200	I think that looks really neat.
5500200	5501400	I love that art style, too.
5502800	5506920	And sadder news, though, for fans of Rocksmith, of which I know three.
5509600	5518480	While Ubisoft is working on Rocksmith Plus, the original Rocksmith from 2011 and all of its DLC
5519160	5526720	are being removed from digital stores that is starting on today on the 17th.
5527080	5530640	So as of today, it's being pulled and delisted.
5531760	5536720	We all know somebody who used to work on Rocksmith, not let's not say them on air, but we all do.
5536840	5544240	Yeah, yeah, but I'm talking about the people who actually are good at this and learned to play freaking guitar from it.
5544400	5545440	It was my idea.
5546080	5550040	Yeah, well, I mean, we're going to have another one, just the old ones going away.
5550200	5554120	Right. Out with the old and with the new, I guess.
5554360	5555880	Yeah, the old was 10 years old.
5556000	5557000	It's fine. Yeah, true.
5557520	5561960	It's dated. Like this program.
5563640	5565600	Girl. All right.
5566160	5572360	Let's travel around the world and check out that hot new current stuff that all the kids are going to be talking about and the release dates from this week.
5572680	5574720	Loki, we'll start with you and the U.S. release dates.
5575520	5582320	Yes. So this week we have the Caligula Effect 2 on Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4.
5582920	5586400	Dying Light Platinum Edition on Nintendo Switch.
5587120	5594160	Corpse Party on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One and Xbox Series X.
5595760	5602040	Disciples Liberation on PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One and Xbox Series X.
5602760	5607320	Echo Generation, which I'm very much looking forward to, this is an awesome looking game.
5607720	5609720	Xbox One, Xbox Series X.
5610880	5613960	We have Ever Tried on Nintendo Switch.
5615360	5619920	Ghaul, the Hero Slayer on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
5620640	5626360	Toy Soldiers HD on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
5626960	5637400	And last but not least, the Dark Pictures Anthology House of Ashes on PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X.
5638680	5643200	I can't believe you'd be leaving out this title I'm looking at for the Nintendo Switch.
5643200	5645040	That's definitely Game of the Year material.
5645280	5648960	It's my friend, Peppa Pig, is out on the switch this week in the U.S.
5649000	5649880	How dare you, Loki?
5650440	5653360	It's not on my list, so I'm not sure if it actually is.
5653920	5654840	Oh, it's on my list.
5654840	5655480	It's lies.
5655520	5656760	Somehow on mine.
5656800	5661400	All right. Anyway, moving over to Japan and checking out releases over there.
5661960	5664520	Blue Reflection, second light on the switch this week.
5664520	5667800	And Archetype Arcadia is out this week in Japan.
5668440	5670240	That's it really for the Nintendo Switch.
5670240	5673080	Taking a look at the PlayStation 5 this week in Japan.
5674480	5675960	I don't think we have anything at all.
5677120	5679200	Let me take a slow week all over.
5679200	5682560	It is all over. I'm just briefly looking at the PlayStation 4.
5683000	5685440	That same Blue Reflection, second light, Archetype Arcadia.
5685440	5687280	Both those games also on the PlayStation 4.
5687520	5690080	But that's really it. Yeah, slow week out there, too.
5690840	5691880	Darsakra, how about the UK?
5693320	5695840	Only three things, and that's for the 22nd.
5695880	5700880	We have the Dark Pictures Triple Pack for PlayStation and Xbox.
5701480	5703640	We have my friend, Peppa Pigu.
5703880	5704720	I'm sorry, Pig.
5705760	5708360	I'm going to Photoshop her into Pig, by the way.
5709360	5712560	That's on PlayStation, Xbox and Switch.
5713040	5717640	And then on Xbox and PlayStation, again,
5717640	5720920	we have the Dark Pictures Anthology, House of Ashes.
5723280	5724280	All right.
5725840	5728000	That's it for the release date.
5728000	5729040	Oh, go ahead.
5729040	5732000	For the record, speaking of Pigu, I forgot to mention.
5732240	5737160	OK, I got to pick the name for Pig in our friend
5737400	5739280	Nick and Princess Nuzlocke thing today.
5740520	5743560	And her name is Amanda Lorien.
5743560	5748160	I like these cute little things since you brought that up in general talk,
5748640	5752880	not just DBD, but obviously you and I watch a lot of the streams we see a lot.
5753160	5756600	I like these cute little challenges that streamers come up for themselves with this.
5756600	5759320	And I guess this whole Nuzlocke thing is based off a Pokemon concept.
5759320	5763440	It is a lot of Pokemon streamers kind of do and started in that whole regard.
5763680	5766600	So I like these cute little challenges that people develop
5766600	5768800	for themselves on Twitch. I think it's cute.
5768800	5772920	So I just like that he's letting everyone pick nicknames, but I actually
5774240	5777720	did my sub in such a way that I got to actually just straight out pick a name.
5778240	5782360	So so, yeah, so as a result of that, I actually
5783320	5785680	I hate seeing photoshopped because I don't use Photoshop anymore.
5785960	5792040	I affinity photoed a picture of pig instead of wearing the pig mask.
5792040	5794840	She's wearing the Mandalorian helmet. Perfect.
5794840	5797840	I'm very proud of my work.
5798080	5801400	And then she was instantly eliminated from the Nuzlocke the first game.
5801440	5802680	I'm just kidding. No, I didn't.
5802680	5807280	I actually actually made it back for the last half of the first game
5807520	5809760	because I thought I'd have time to go do my makeup and everything.
5810040	5813320	And it was it was a pig who was winner.
5813840	5816400	Oh, fun. OK, it was best do.
5817640	5821200	Let's move on. We have some more stories for you guys due to the late start tonight.
5821200	5823840	I think we're going to kind of pick up the pace with these last few stories here.
5824520	5826640	And because I know we have at least two emails tonight
5826640	5829120	and I want to see if we can try to squeeze in a call or two.
5829320	5832280	But to do that, we're going to go through these stories a little faster than usual.
5832280	5834920	It's just, I think, like five stories. So we'll start with Loki.
5835880	5840680	Yeah, so Sony's finally letting us buy PlayStation fives directly from them.
5841160	5842840	They put up a website to go ahead and do that.
5842840	5845800	You have to put your username in there to try to restrict it.
5845920	5847800	One per household.
5847800	5851440	Also, probably the fact that, you know, a lot of these other bigger chains
5851640	5854360	like Best Buy and stuff are scalping them, which is nice.
5855680	5860160	So, yeah, if you're interested in purchasing a PlayStation five,
5860160	5863040	then you probably want to go to PlayStation dot com to their register
5863040	5868200	the buy page and register to do that to see if you can pick one up.
5869160	5871200	You know, Jason kind of referenced that in the intro tonight
5871200	5874240	about how the retailers must not be so happy about the hat.
5874240	5877320	But I also kind of don't scalp it.
5877440	5880400	Yeah, I also see why it's in Sony's interest to do that,
5880600	5883960	especially when we talk about, you know, these shortages of consoles.
5884000	5886600	You know, we had that story about Microsoft a couple of weeks ago.
5886920	5889400	These shortages don't look like they're going to ease up anytime soon.
5889400	5891280	That's a lot of what we're hearing about in the news.
5891280	5894400	News outside of gaming world is like how, you know,
5894400	5896600	the ships are having troubles getting into docks
5896600	5899000	because there's not as many workers, the docks, et cetera.
5899200	5900560	It's kind of having this ripple effect.
5900560	5904320	Or is it all because of that ship that was stuck in the Suez Canal?
5904360	5907920	Is it all because of that is all because of the evergreen that is happening?
5908480	5909280	I don't know. I shouldn't.
5909280	5912160	I shouldn't laugh because it is a lot of problems.
5913120	5916000	But yeah, now we're hearing about these supply chains are picking up.
5916200	5918720	But that isn't probably going to have much impact,
5918720	5920520	unfortunately, on PlayStation five.
5920520	5922080	So. All right.
5922080	5925280	And as Joe and her mat says, not really today's
5925520	5928080	and referring to today's problems, are they caused by the evergreen?
5928200	5929720	But it was a problem for a bit.
5929720	5933200	And Mike Deaf says it's column A, column B. All right. All right.
5934040	5936160	Moving on. I think this is interesting.
5936160	5939760	The all chat or slash all chat is being disabled,
5939760	5942880	at least for a brief time in League of Legends there.
5943080	5946280	The developers have made a decision to keep this off for a couple of patches
5946480	5948120	and ask players for feedback.
5948120	5952160	So usually you can use slash all to chat with folks from the other team
5952160	5953280	after a match.
5953280	5956880	And as I'm sure that goes well in many cases, right?
5957000	5959200	I'm sure people know how to behave themselves
5959320	5961600	and respect the other players at the end of a match.
5961760	5965520	I haven't played League of Legends because the one time I did play it,
5965520	5967760	somebody used that all feature to say something.
5967880	5970000	And I decided I didn't want to play anymore.
5970000	5972800	So I can and you know, it's interesting.
5974160	5976200	I think this could be a response.
5976200	5978760	Maybe this is me being a little tinfoil hatty, but I don't care.
5979840	5982280	I think this could be a response to Pokemon Unite.
5983280	5986560	And why a lot of people are kind of loving that MOBA right now.
5986560	5988320	Now, granted, maybe I kind of stopped playing it,
5988320	5989640	but I've kind of kept an eye on it
5989640	5991920	and I see some streamers that are still doing it and stuff.
5991920	5994960	And I think part of why people are apt to play that game
5995200	5998040	is because there is no chat feature and that, you know,
5998040	6001160	you only have the brief little phrases you can say to each other.
6001160	6004520	It's enough to send some basic communication about the game.
6004640	6006720	And sure, there's some things that annoy people,
6006720	6009480	like people voting to abandon a game too soon and things like that.
6009680	6011240	But for the most part,
6011240	6014520	not having to put up with the straight up toxic and abusive chat
6014520	6017400	that sometimes faces the player chat at the end of a game
6018600	6020880	is probably a refreshing feeling. Quite frankly.
6022320	6023960	I wish they do this in Dead by Daylight, too.
6024960	6026760	I would not miss that postgame chat one bit.
6027320	6031440	So anyway, that's why I think the Windows store
6031440	6033800	is actually the best place to play Dead by Daylight.
6033800	6036920	Actually, Stadia is not bad either, because you can kind of like see it,
6036920	6039360	but you're not expected to participate in that chat.
6039360	6040760	But anyway. All right.
6043400	6046200	Also, you can still see with what League of Legends is doing,
6046200	6049200	the control one, two, three, four spam emotes and things like that.
6049200	6051240	So it's not going to stop teabagging or anything like that.
6051720	6054280	However, it seems like this might not last long.
6054280	6056800	The reaction to this change has been negative.
6057120	6060040	People saying that, you know, when they actually bond with people
6060040	6063440	and when the system works well, they kind of miss that.
6063640	6066680	And that the toxic behavior is actually happening with team chats.
6066680	6070080	And I could absolutely see that and agree with that as well.
6070960	6073920	This has been clarified on Twitter that they're just testing this
6074080	6077680	and they will keep or reverse the change based on the feedback they get.
6077680	6081600	They should just let people opt in or out of those chats completely, quite frankly.
6082600	6087000	Mike Defton chat says, people are still hella toxic in Unite, though. How?
6088080	6090520	I guess maybe just through emotes or their actions.
6090520	6092080	I could see that that maybe people through there,
6092080	6096120	like they start to do actions that negatively impact the team.
6096120	6099440	I could see that you're just you're not going to get unfortunate.
6099440	6103880	Like people are going to be shitty any way they can sometimes, unfortunately. So.
6105840	6108800	And fifth dream says, even the Pokemon moba is toxic.
6108800	6111240	So I bet that all chat is terrible.
6112560	6113560	All right.
6115160	6116160	Let's see.
6116840	6119800	Mike Defton says, though, I prefer Unite to other MOBAs.
6120240	6124560	All those comments coming from our chat over Twitch.TV slash VOG Network.
6125080	6126080	Dark Sakura.
6127280	6131480	So this isn't really like super surprising,
6131880	6139000	but it turns out that video game industry has really been learning that
6139840	6143960	a lot of people are able to work from home.
6144280	6145680	They can work remotely
6147680	6150840	as long as they've got the machinery that they need for it.
6151600	6153240	But yeah, like, for example,
6155000	6156080	Asper Media,
6157280	6159000	who's based out of Austin, Texas,
6160000	6163400	working on Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic remake.
6163800	6164560	They're great with it.
6164560	6166800	They're letting their people work from home,
6167000	6170520	and they are highly productive when doing it.
6171160	6174360	Whereas some of these other companies like, no, you have to be here.
6175400	6178520	Like you make someone sign an NDA and they can work from home.
6179360	6182280	I mean, there's a lot of advantages to it,
6182280	6185840	as well as just keeping their employees safe and giving
6185840	6190280	giving them a healthier work life balance, I think,
6190760	6196120	because they don't have to worry about, you know, the commute, the gas,
6196320	6200640	the not seeing their their home, I guess that makes sense.
6201480	6205680	But actually being present in a dedicated space for it,
6205680	6207840	then they can leave and they're already home.
6208520	6210200	That's how I feel about my job anyway.
6210200	6213680	Right. I could see where, you know, I know a lot of video game companies
6213680	6216160	have been struggling with the whole work at home thing
6216160	6218280	because there is so much collaboration that happens.
6218280	6222520	I just I would think a hybrid solution is probably very doable
6222520	6223520	for a lot of companies.
6223520	6225880	We're like, maybe we're in the office Tuesday, Thursday,
6226080	6228320	but we're work from home Monday, Wednesday, Friday, something like that,
6228320	6231440	where, you know, so at least some of some of those collaborations can happen.
6231440	6234960	But I would also greatly see, A, I haven't worked in the game industry,
6234960	6235640	so I don't really know.
6235640	6238600	B, I could see where maybe that works for some companies, not for others.
6238960	6241880	And OK, so.
6242800	6244640	But I'm not surprised to hear that some of the companies
6244640	6245360	are going to stick with it.
6245360	6250320	I'm really not because, you know, the companies can also look at it
6250320	6255480	as we can save on not having to rent a giant building for all the office space.
6255720	6258760	We can have a small place for the occasional collaborations
6258760	6261520	and things like that, but we don't need all this space otherwise.
6261720	6264320	I think that's I think that's going to be the most interesting thing post
6264320	6268720	pandemic is what happens to a lot of these these job places
6269000	6271280	where the workforces are going completely remote.
6272320	6274560	Are they going to be like a collaborative workspace
6274560	6277040	and you're going to see more of those type of pop up?
6277520	6278720	I wouldn't be mad about it.
6278720	6281920	I mean, honestly enough, like I was actually just kind of thinking
6281920	6283760	about where I work.
6283760	6289680	They just built a huge new building in Austin for our group there,
6290120	6295320	and they're doing all kinds of building work for for us at mine.
6295320	6296880	You know, not saying where I work,
6298320	6300480	but at the same time, it.
6302400	6306120	I think half of the reason that some companies want people to be
6306760	6312280	in in a location is for culture, at least that's what it is with with my job.
6312440	6314760	A lot of it has to do with our culture of collaboration.
6315360	6319760	But at the same time, you know, I think that.
6321120	6323720	There has to come a point where you need to learn
6324160	6327760	to balance the bigger picture with that culture,
6327760	6330800	and I don't think culture has suffered at all where I work.
6330800	6333160	We're still collaborating and we're still talking.
6333640	6336360	You know, we're still helping each other out.
6336360	6337840	We're just doing it remotely now.
6337840	6340040	It just changed the method of our communication.
6340080	6344320	Same for us, and we do very different things at our day jobs. Exactly.
6346240	6348720	Critical myth in chat says my company is leasing out parts
6348720	6351400	of our corporate buildings since they have so many of us working remotely now.
6351920	6355400	S.J. 100 Matt says my job was forced to go full remote during the pandemic
6355400	6356200	due to the pandemic.
6356200	6358000	Excuse me. And we were forced to figure it out.
6358000	6360200	Now we have no plans of being back in an office again.
6360200	6363280	So it's possible if companies support their staff to get the right equipment.
6363520	6368320	And I should have had Matt not to like talk about your business on air too much.
6368320	6369440	So I apologize in advance.
6369440	6372240	But aren't you like moving to now?
6372240	6375600	So because like you don't have to commute as much anymore.
6375600	6377680	Like I thought I was picking up on that was a thing.
6378200	6380560	And you're not alone in that regard.
6380560	6381080	There's a lot of people.
6381080	6383880	And you even said in chat there, oh, you moved a year ago.
6383880	6386040	Shit, I'm slow, aren't I?
6386920	6390240	But OK, so but the point and the why so kind of stands, right?
6390840	6394440	S.J. 100 Matt says it's already a huge problem in New York City and San Francisco.
6394440	6397080	I'm so curious what San Francisco is going to look like in 10 years.
6397560	6399840	So curious.
6399840	6400760	I love San Francisco.
6400760	6402640	I love the culture. I love the town.
6402640	6406160	It's always been prohibitively expensive to do a lot there.
6406160	6409360	So I'm super curious to see what this is going to do.
6409640	6411040	Going to be interesting.
6411040	6413880	Anyway, go ahead.
6413880	6417200	I was also just thinking, you know.
6418400	6422160	There's a lot of attitudes,
6422160	6425960	I think, that are rooted in the old way.
6426120	6427640	Does that make sense?
6428520	6433960	So I think that it's going to require not just you have to do this for now,
6434480	6436520	but there has to be like a total shift of mindset.
6437840	6440640	My work wants us back in January.
6440640	6442400	I don't think it's going to happen.
6442400	6446160	Ours are well, we we've pretty much said we're going to be work
6446160	6448480	from home is an option forever, pretty much.
6448720	6452000	But they want to do some things in person, which I get like training.
6452000	6454240	They want to do in person, which is very near and dear to my heart.
6454240	6455760	And I completely get that.
6456240	6458280	I should say when it makes sense.
6458280	6460880	There are some trainings still virtual is completely fine.
6460880	6463040	But I totally get there are some job
6463720	6465760	skill based training they really want to do in person.
6466000	6469720	So I think it's just a matter of when is it safe to do that really?
6470000	6473240	And that kind of keeps getting pushed back for us as well.
6473440	6477400	And I they're not they're not saying when I'm
6477800	6480480	but I'm guessing January is what they're looking at,
6480480	6483920	but kind of not saying anything until they're going to commit to it this time.
6484520	6485120	If that makes sense.
6485120	6485640	No.
6486840	6491600	Mine mine said September and then October and now January and.
6493680	6496400	I still don't feel comfortable going back, but it is what it is.
6498400	6500520	Yeah. All right.
6500520	6502760	Let's move on to our next story, Loki.
6504240	6507000	All right, so we're talking about speed runners,
6507280	6511120	of course, when we're talking about cheating, and that's the case
6511120	6516480	with Barry Mode's record for, I believe, the classic Spelunky.
6516960	6522520	And it was found that he had used, I think, a.
6524240	6529440	Program to basically kind of it's almost like a task where he was able to
6531080	6533560	basically reset points where he.
6534720	6537000	Died in like redo that section.
6537000	6539840	So he said, well, I, you know, I ran it,
6540080	6544920	but, you know, I just remove the this I eliminated the starting over factor,
6545480	6547760	because that's why a big part of speed running is hard.
6547960	6551560	So he doesn't really think that he cheated, but obviously his
6551720	6554960	he's deleted his video, they posted online, they submitted to
6556560	6559120	the speed running scene and also, of course,
6560680	6563760	didn't confess to any of this stuff until it was pointed out
6564080	6569520	that there was a missing tile that was appearing any time that the screen changed.
6569840	6576000	And that was a symptom of a certain program that it's used to kind of automate that.
6578800	6579680	Shame, shame.
6581720	6583400	Pixel pockets and chat says, wow.
6583400	6583760	Yeah.
6583800	6584080	Wow.
6584080	6584480	Indeed.
6587200	6587720	All right.
6587760	6588040	Yeah.
6588040	6592000	And it was apparently it was such a good record that, you know,
6592000	6593000	no one's been able to beat it.
6593040	6598320	Well, yeah, obviously, because, you know, wasn't all through one run, but.
6600320	6602200	Yeah, what are you going to do?
6602200	6602760	All right.
6602760	6603840	I know disqualify him.
6603840	6604320	That's what you're going to do.
6604320	6605320	That's what you're going to do.
6605320	6605760	All right.
6606760	6608960	Lastly, tonight, before we get to the roundtable,
6609280	6612240	I want to talk about this, I think this is great.
6612480	6615440	The Xbox Series X fridge is happening.
6615480	6617600	It's a real thing and you can preorder it.
6617840	6618520	Here's the thing.
6618520	6622360	They made it a mini fridge, I guess, to make it a little more consumer.
6622560	6625680	I'm assuming with all the problems going on with deliveries in the world,
6625680	6628000	so probably makes it a little easier to deliver on to.
6628200	6631480	But the Xbox mini fridge will be available for the holidays.
6631760	6636480	The fridge costs one hundred dollars and preorder start in two days.
6636480	6637400	So the 19th.
6638920	6645080	So, yeah, the mini fridge, of course, is like the actual fridge that Xbox tweeted.
6645080	6648760	I think they who think if they give one to Snoop Dogg and somebody else, I think.
6648760	6651000	Yeah. So they gave the fridge the fridge.
6651440	6654800	But the mini fridge will still be great for storing your weed.
6654960	6659040	If you want to put that in there and a couple of sodas or whatever.
6659360	6661520	So anyway, I think that's great.
6661520	6663760	I think that's so funny. I actually kind of want one.
6663760	6664960	I'm going to be honest.
6665160	6667840	I imagine it's the size of an actual Xbox console.
6669080	6670120	I think that's really cool.
6671040	6672480	Mike Deff says I would buy it.
6672720	6674640	Fifth Dream says store your KFC in it.
6674640	6678560	Sure. Although I hope you I hope you like Kentucky Fried Gold.
6680480	6681920	Anyway, I think that's great.
6682320	6685480	All right, let's get to the roundtable.
6685880	6688680	We will try to get I don't know if anybody wants to call.
6688680	6691560	Join the green room so I can get an idea how many calls we have.
6691760	6694640	But I know we have emails tonight, so I'm going to get to it.
6695360	6698440	Oh, Bobby Black Wolf says, considering it for the basement.
6698440	6701240	Oh, do it. It looks so good down there, Bobby.
6701240	6703960	Right out right outside of Black Wolf Theater.
6703960	6708640	It'd be great, especially, you know, keep some keep some sodas in there and, you know,
6708640	6712760	maybe wine or beer if you're so inclined that people can enjoy while they're having a movie.
6712760	6714640	I love that. Love that.
6715840	6718680	Pixel Pocket says they said it can hold 12 cans.
6718680	6722120	So it's probably a little bigger than just your typical Xbox Series X.
6722320	6723960	Yeah, that makes sense. Probably a little bigger.
6723960	6728080	So anyway, your emails participate at orange.traded.com.
6728080	6732120	And it's I feel like for weeks and weeks on the show, I've said no emails, no emails, no emails.
6732480	6734240	And now we got three.
6734560	6735880	Yeah, we got a few. Let's get to it.
6735920	6736920	Dark Sakura.
6738920	6740800	So first one's a little long.
6740800	6742480	OK. Hello, LR.
6742480	6746160	I was catching up on slightly out of date episodes and I figured I'd drop a line.
6746160	6749960	But since I can't fit a fishing line in here, an email will happen instead.
6750000	6751000	Whomp.
6751440	6755680	During the October 3rd episode, there was a bit of confusion regarding two games,
6755680	6757120	Paddle Dipon and Puzzle Dipon.
6757640	6759760	The confusion is totally understandable.
6759760	6764400	I didn't realize it at the time I was listening, but both games were actually released in Japan during the same year.
6765400	6769560	With such similar games and release dates, it's no wonder they're easy to confuse.
6769800	6776400	Amazingly, despite its undoubtedly low distribution for the U.S., Puzzle Dipon, the first puzzle bobble style game ever released
6776960	6782640	by Visco for Neo Geo, came out in America first before anyone had ever played Tetris Attack.
6783360	6789040	The game that many of us are familiar with Tetris Attack was the North American rebranding of Paddle Dipon,
6789440	6796320	which actually released for SNES the following year, 1996, which is this
6798080	6801760	that I just showed up on on cam for those who are watching live.
6804200	6808880	But the truly most astounding fact about both games is that according to the O.L.R.
6808880	6812240	fandom page, neither one has been featured as an O.L.R.
6812240	6813480	classic game of the week.
6813480	6819200	As a fan of both games, I would love to see both are one of them honored sometime in the future.
6819560	6820800	Well, if wishes were fishes.
6821240	6827600	Anyway, Dark Sakura will consider your request and get back to you in an appropriate time frame when she feels is appropriate.
6828440	6830840	Which will be a very long time.
6832600	6836920	There was something Rob mentioned during the same episode that I found to be pretty funny.
6837920	6843440	He said he'd been to round one and played the latest version of Beatmania 2DX28 Beastrover.
6843640	6847760	Well, guess what? As of October 13th, there was no longer the latest version.
6847760	6850720	Beatmania 2DX29 Cast Hour is available.
6850720	6855560	So sorry, Rob. You have not, in fact, played the latest version lol.
6855640	6858600	I think somebody called that out live in chat or on Twitter or something.
6858600	6862720	Yeah, so that's I'm still waiting for that round one out in Roseville nearby.
6863360	6866000	When Misty was here, I don't think I brought this up on the show.
6866240	6870880	Long time fan of the show, super fan, Misty OLR was out here last weekend.
6870880	6877640	And she and I went on a she wanted in and out because, of course, East Coasters, they come visit, they want in and out.
6878040	6880400	So we went. But I was like, well, we have time.
6880400	6883640	So you didn't say which in and out something you do the in and out by Golf Land.
6883880	6885800	So we drove all the way out to that one.
6886040	6889000	And then I was like, while we're out here, let's point and laugh at Golf Land.
6889000	6895960	So we did that. And then I said, let's go to the mall because I want to see how far along the round one construction.
6895960	6899080	Is sadly, it doesn't look like it's quite done yet.
6899080	6902440	The movie theater looks like the movie theater looks like it'll open first.
6902440	6904320	Yes. They had the poster frames out.
6904720	6911760	They have the the movie theater says coming twenty twenty one and round one says coming twenty twenty two.
6911760	6913560	So it's not going to be this year.
6913720	6916200	By that time, thirtieth style will be out.
6917160	6923280	Anyway, and I was I was peeking in there, too, because we just went to the mall this week and I was peeking in
6924280	6926480	because they have doors open to see the construction.
6926480	6928200	It's it's all empty in there.
6928200	6930760	Like, I don't think they're anywhere close to opening.
6930800	6932160	Oh, wow. All right.
6932160	6933160	And I'm sorry. Sorry, Dr.
6933160	6934280	Zarka, you may continue.
6935360	6938840	OK, I'll leave you all with this.
6938840	6943280	I've decided for the second year in a row to do a charity Twitch stream around my birthday in mid-November,
6943600	6948080	during which I attempt the Ohio DDR Max 300 birthday challenge.
6948400	6952560	Basically, you have to clear Max 300 as many times as your age,
6952800	6956280	with at least half of those being on the hardest difficulty you can pass.
6957160	6961120	So for me this year, that means forty two times twenty one of them on expert
6961520	6964840	exact date charity and other details to be announced later.
6965040	6970600	But last year I supported Feeding America and most likely I'll be doing that again.
6971000	6976440	I hope that some of you will join me as long as you can stand listening to the same song forty two times.
6976440	6979120	I promise I'll make it as interesting as I possibly can.
6979560	6981960	Thanks, as usual, for the show and have a great week.
6982080	6986320	Why? Why are I figured it had to be why? Why are good luck?
6986320	6992920	I will not be joining you in participating, but I will if you're streaming or whatever, I'll happily join you to say hello.
6993200	6997120	So and cheer you on, because that sounds like a heart attack for me.
6998160	6999920	But I love that for you.
6999920	7002880	And I hope you're able, you know, don't push yourself.
7002880	7005080	Listen, your body, if your body says stop, stop.
7005160	7009640	That's my only that's that's going to be my my dad moment
7009640	7012400	there for somebody who's going to be a year younger than me.
7013880	7016400	All right. But good luck with it and yay for charity.
7017640	7019720	Next email real fast.
7019720	7021320	Hello, O.L.R.
7021320	7025440	Last week, Rob mentioned having some comfort issues when playing Metroid Dread.
7025760	7029600	I was wondering if you've been using the switch pro controller when you play it.
7029920	7033520	I just beat the game over the weekend, and at one point I switched
7033560	7035560	a handheld mode and played most of the Joy-Cons.
7035560	7040320	And yeah, it didn't feel comfy with Metroid, since it's a lot of usage of triggers.
7040720	7044080	It's a night and day difference to play that game using a pro controller.
7044520	7046320	Anyways, I hope you're enjoying it.
7046320	7050680	Fusion is my favorite 2D Metroid, but this game might be even better for me.
7051000	7054520	Now I'm just looking forward to a successor to one of my favorite games
7054520	7057680	ever made, Metroid Prime. Keep on playing Garth Wolf.
7058080	7062040	Well, you probably heard it early in the show, but I am using a pro controller,
7062040	7064840	specifically the Splatoon with the green and pink on the bottom.
7065160	7069720	And you can go about my my personal channel doesn't have the videos.
7069720	7072720	So you go right to the end of the last stream and you can kind of see when I'm
7072720	7076120	like kind of hurting and I explain it a little more what I'm going through.
7077120	7081680	That's very ironic because Shane, who's still in chat.
7081680	7086440	So correct me if I'm wrong, played the game with those regular Joy-Con controllers,
7086440	7087320	but they were plugged.
7087320	7089680	I think he just played the switch in portable most of it.
7089840	7091200	So you're just kind of plugged in there.
7091200	7093480	And he, as he said, he didn't have any problems.
7093480	7095960	So I think it just it really depends on the person.
7096040	7100880	It sounds like let's be real, probably partially the age in my case.
7101280	7106160	Who knows? Anyway, I'm I'm
7106720	7108840	I'm favorable to the game.
7108840	7111560	It just I had to shift my mindset a little bit.
7111560	7116000	It wasn't what I was expecting at first, but I appreciate what it's trying to do.
7116720	7120560	Again, the control, the controller thing is just that red flag emoji meme.
7120560	7123800	That's all. Anyhow, that's all I have to say.
7125000	7127680	Last email. Hi all.
7127680	7130720	To be a tad different with this email compared to my previous ones,
7130720	7133720	I figured that I would provide answers to a question that folks may have
7133720	7139080	regarding gaming after a stroke, but for whatever reasons haven't been asked.
7141280	7143360	I kind of know already, but
7144360	7148960	well, what it's like trying to game now that I've had a stroke compared to before.
7148960	7153920	Well, it's a lot harder seeing as I only have the use of my left hand.
7153920	7157920	Some games can easily be played one handed, like some pinball games.
7158280	7162320	Magic and Diablo, other games like first person shooters and fighting games.
7162320	7165560	I haven't figured out a way to play them effectively yet.
7166040	7168640	It's incredibly frustrating. Is it possible?
7168640	7169480	I don't know.
7169480	7171360	Maybe any game that can be played
7171360	7175160	with the mouse only or can be played with rebound keys are doable.
7175560	7179560	If anyone wants additional info, feel free to ask and chat tangentially.
7179560	7181680	Tonight might be my last dream for a while.
7181680	7184200	I'm moving in the morning and I don't know if.
7185760	7188960	I don't what's an NRE place has Internet.
7190960	7194360	So. Yeah, ask. Ask.
7195880	7197400	No one really.
7199600	7202040	Again, sorry, you're going through that.
7202040	7204040	But and the moving and everything.
7204040	7204880	Good luck with the move.
7204880	7207400	Moving is a pain, but good luck with all that.
7207640	7209280	We're not going to be here next week anyway.
7209280	7211520	So it gives you two weeks to find a Wi-Fi to steal.
7211520	7215600	So I hope that works out in your favor for what that is worth.
7215600	7218080	I think it meant for streaming.
7218080	7222520	Oh, well, yeah, just to get get a Wi-Fi connection to stream the show.
7224200	7227920	Just to do his streaming, I think. Oh, oh, oh, yeah, yeah.
7228160	7229840	That might be a difficult for sure.
7229840	7232200	Yeah. So. All right.
7232200	7233480	But thanks for the email, nonetheless.
7233480	7239000	And I always like to hear from gamers perspectives from their shoes.
7239440	7243120	You know, we've heard from over the years gamers in other countries
7243120	7245480	who it's not as easy to buy video games.
7245720	7250120	We've heard from gamers who are blind and, you know, have faced
7250120	7251160	those type of challenges.
7251160	7253600	And we get to hear about some of those types of workarounds.
7253920	7256600	I always like to kind of hear from gamers that make us kind of stop
7256600	7259440	and think and kind of go like, oh, this is this is,
7260640	7262960	you know, gaming is for everyone, right?
7262960	7267000	So I kind of like to hear like how some people, the lengths
7267000	7270040	that they'll go to make sure that they get the gaming experiences.
7270040	7272760	I think that's a good thing for us all to be aware of, too.
7273320	7276440	I still say look for switch controls like next switch.
7278000	7281760	Because they make those for quadriplegics.
7282480	7285560	And I know people who are like
7285880	7289920	doom masters and play with their neck.
7291600	7295880	Only She-Hulk in chat reminding us Microsoft has a great controller
7295880	7297320	for that as well.
7297320	7299880	So that's yes, that's a great call out, too.
7299920	7303120	So well, and I think that's any Apple product comes with switch control
7303120	7305400	built in. Hmm. Cool. So.
7307080	7311400	All right. Oh, I didn't check to see if we had a green room.
7311400	7313720	OK, we don't have any callers that want to call in tonight.
7315520	7318720	But I think we're at about 830, which is usually would be wrapping up anyway.
7318720	7320280	The podcast is going to seem a little smaller,
7320280	7322680	but that's because, of course, we got a late start tonight.
7322680	7324800	We didn't start till 630 because the power outage.
7324800	7327200	So thanks for that up.
7327200	7329560	Let me quickly, though, before we completely wrap up tonight,
7329560	7331520	check in with any last minute stories, Loki.
7333040	7335520	Just that Sony has threatened
7335520	7339520	dbrand with legal action because they were offering those alternative
7339840	7343800	black face plates for the PlayStation five.
7343800	7347360	And while dbrand
7348000	7350920	did mention that the texture that were on those face
7350920	7354080	plates was familiar, but legally distinct.
7354120	7356520	Apparently, it wasn't as legally distinct as they thought.
7356760	7360640	So, yeah, those have been taken down and they made a shit post
7360760	7364320	about it on Reddit instead of, you know, responding to Sony.
7365560	7368040	Obi Wan Jabroni in chat says, I have those plates.
7368480	7369160	How do you like them?
7369160	7372040	Was it worth it? Legit, curious.
7372040	7374200	I don't even have PlayStation five still.
7374200	7375920	It's probably not going to happen this holiday,
7375920	7378960	but probably next summer, I'll end up getting one.
7378960	7380160	That's about the right time frame.
7380160	7383160	So anything else, Loki?
7384720	7386640	No, that's it. All right.
7386640	7388840	Well, then let me take an opportunity to thank everybody
7388840	7391320	for supporting Orange Launch Radio and coming out,
7391320	7393400	whether you were listening live here on Sunday night
7393400	7397440	and stuck through the power outage and all that stuff to actually
7399320	7401440	be here live with us tonight. I appreciate that.
7401800	7402600	Thank you. Thank you.
7402600	7404400	Thanks to my hosts for being patient.
7404400	7408560	Thanks to Bobby Blackwell for vamping in the face of that silly power outage.
7408720	7412040	I did get a nice reply from social media person for the power company here.
7412240	7416840	So, yeah, they said, I hope you were able to do your show.
7416840	7419800	Sorry, we're working to get it done or something like that.
7419800	7423560	So, you know, at least with them, like with Smud,
7423560	7426680	like I had to say that their customer service has actually been pretty great
7426680	7431000	because we've had it before where they will call me when the power is out.
7431000	7434120	They're like, hey, we know that your power is out, you know, like
7434120	7435280	and I wasn't even home.
7435280	7438680	I was like, oh, OK, it's going to be restored at this time, you know.
7439320	7442400	So they preemptively call, whereas like if Comcast was out,
7442400	7444200	they'd be just like, we don't exist.
7444200	7446560	I don't I don't have a problem with the power company here.
7446560	7447320	They are pretty good.
7447320	7450480	I'm I'm very happy with who we have compared to the alternative
7450480	7452720	that the rest of the state has most of the rest of the state has.
7453680	7457000	So and I'll I'll I'll send a nice reply to their social media person.
7457000	7460680	It's just frustrating that the power was out on Monday
7460680	7463640	and then the power was out again right before O.L.R.
7463640	7466800	like it just we had to replace food in the fridge because we lost power
7466800	7469680	for 12 hours. So, yeah, anyway.
7471000	7476480	But I get that the wind dictated that not necessarily the power company.
7476480	7478600	It is what it is. All right.
7478600	7481240	Anyway, I was going to give the rest of my spiel, but Dark Soccer,
7481240	7483280	I know you need a little extra time to prepare for your stream.
7483280	7485880	So I thought I'd let you go ahead and give your exit now
7485880	7487880	and then I'll give the rest of spiel and sign off for the night.
7487880	7489040	So Dark Soccer, any final thoughts?
7490240	7492600	I do have certain people that I would like to share
7492600	7495200	my community with next week while I am gone.
7495600	7500560	So I will be listing them and letting people know.
7500760	7505400	But they're people who I who I trust to take good care of y'all.
7506880	7510880	All right. And stay tuned for some dead by daylight, because I have a vendetta.
7512240	7516360	All right. I have to I have to just argue against MMR before
7517480	7520880	Barista Witch comes out on Tuesday.
7520880	7524280	What's her name? Michaela? Like that's such a.
7524280	7525200	Post-millennial.
7525200	7528480	I thought you liked Michaela because she is you.
7528880	7533120	She is me. Don't get me wrong, but people are going to be toxic as shit with her.
7533200	7534840	I know. I know.
7534840	7538160	But in her nickname now in all the circles in any way is Barista Witch.
7538160	7540160	So because that's exactly what she is.
7540200	7542160	She is a barista and a witch.
7543360	7545520	All right. We'll see you in two weeks.
7546560	7549360	All right. See you in the cloud, in the cloud, in the fog.
7549840	7554840	All right. Let me give the rest of my spiel here and then we'll get around to final, final thoughts.
7555200	7559920	So first off, thank you guys so much for downloading or listening to our podcast live tonight.
7560120	7563400	If you enjoyed what you heard here at OLR, tell a friend or two, help us spread the word.
7563560	7567440	We are the show where every gamer has a voice, but we need the voices here to get out on air
7568440	7570440	to have more voices.
7570440	7574440	We have a shop if you're interested in that, vognetwork.com slash shop.
7574440	7578440	If you would like to pick up some OLR merchandise or possibly some fog network merchandise,
7578440	7585440	a Bobby Black Wolf mug, whatever, whatever tickles your fancy, check that out over vognetwork.com slash shop.
7585440	7590440	Otherwise, we'll be back in two weeks. We will not be here next week.
7590440	7595440	Dark Sakura talked about at the beginning of the show, she has some personal issues she's going to tend to
7595440	7598440	in, in the place where she grew up and I'm going to Disneyland.
7598440	7601440	So two, two very different reasons to not be here.
7601440	7605440	Loki will be using next. What are you going to do next week with a week off, Loki?
7605440	7606440	Play Minecraft.
7606440	7609440	I was gonna say play Minecraft, work on videos, something like that?
7609440	7610440	Probably, yeah.
7610440	7613440	You could do a stream. I bet Bobby would pass the viewers to you.
7613440	7615440	I could do a stream.
7615440	7616440	Think about it.
7616440	7618440	I could do a stream. That is a possibility.
7618440	7621440	DDR in the garage might work. We'll see.
7621440	7623440	Haven't played DDR in a while.
7623440	7625440	I was thinking about it the other day too.
7625440	7629440	Get some inspiration from that YYRE email.
7629440	7631440	Yeah.
7631440	7633440	All right. We'll see.
7633440	7635440	We'll see. All right. Let's see.
7635440	7637440	So we'll be back in two weeks.
7637440	7641440	So Loki, Loki, we won't see you for three weeks because
7641440	7645440	you're, you're not going to be here on Halloween night because obviously you have children
7645440	7647440	and you're obligated to take the children trick or treating.
7647440	7649440	So I totally understand that.
7649440	7652440	But yeah, good luck with all your Minecraft production
7652440	7655440	and I'm excited for you with all these updates and all that stuff.
7655440	7658440	So yeah, any final thoughts for our listeners tonight?
7659440	7662440	No, just hoping to have another video out this week.
7662440	7665440	Lots of updates to my base I'm doing.
7665440	7668440	It's all the Ninjago, Lego Ninjago theme.
7668440	7674440	So I've been basing my first section off of the actual official Lego Ninjago city set
7674440	7676440	and it looks pretty awesome.
7676440	7677440	Awesome.
7677440	7680440	My final thought, I'll plug my channel over twitch.tv slash Rob Roberts.
7680440	7682440	I've been pretty good for two weeks now.
7682440	7684440	Like I've gotten in at least three streams a week after.
7684440	7687440	I have hit one of the milestones for partner finally.
7687440	7690440	Finally. I've been like doing this for a long time.
7690440	7692440	No, it's not the viewer one.
7692440	7694440	That's clearly the hardest one to get.
7694440	7696440	But I have done 12 different streams in the past month.
7696440	7699440	So follow me over twitch.tv slash Rob Roberts.
7699440	7701440	I'm really close to 500 followers.
7701440	7702440	That's kind of a landmark.
7702440	7704440	So yeah, I would appreciate that.
7704440	7706440	But it's all good either way.
7706440	7708440	We'll see you back here at Vaga Network in two weeks.
7708440	7710440	Bobby will be here next week though.
7710440	7715440	So, you know, come come here at your usual time at 5 Pacific 8 Eastern
7715440	7716440	and he'll be here to entertain.
7716440	7719440	He can do another jumbo show potentially next week.
7719440	7720440	So there is that.
7720440	7721440	That's it.
7721440	7722440	Have a great week.
7722440	7724440	Happy gaming.
7724440	7725440	Happy Halloween.
7725440	7726440	We'll be back on Halloween night.
7726440	7729440	Happy Rocky Horror season to my friends who are participating with that
7729440	7733440	and getting their first show back like I am in a very long time.
7733440	7735440	That is going to be awesome.
7735440	7738440	And yeah, be safe out there.
7738440	7740440	Make good choices.
7740440	7741440	Wear your mask.
7741440	7742440	Get vaccinated.
7742440	7743440	That's it, everybody.
7743440	7744440	Have a great night.
7744440	7747440	You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
7747440	7751440	Orange Lounge Radio is a production of OLR Studios.
