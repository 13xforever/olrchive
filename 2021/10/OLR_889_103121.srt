00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,720
This week, we're back to bring you spooky, frightful, and delightful gaming news. Because

2
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:18,880
for some reason, society sees adults going door to door to collect candy socially unacceptable

3
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:25,040
for some reason. That's okay, I wanted savory, sugar-free candy anyway, because health matters

4
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:31,120
when you're an adult. Anyway, now it's time for your hosts Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers,

5
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:34,400
and Loki to bring you two weeks of gaming news, starting right now on the show where

6
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:47,840
every gamer has a voice. Welcome back to another weekly show where every gamer has a voice. It is

7
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:58,320
Orange Lounge Radio, and we are live on Halloween, spooky season. This is episode number 889 for this

8
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:05,680
October 31st, Halloween of 2021. We are back after not being here last week, but we are very happy

9
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:10,080
to be back to talk about the latest in video games, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.

10
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:14,800
My name is Rob Roberts, and I am joined every week by the one and only DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

11
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:22,640
Oh, hi. Hi, how are you? I'm a little warm, but I'm okay. So for the Twitch people, because we do

12
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:26,160
tape live every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern, right after the

13
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:31,360
Bobby Blackwell show at VOG Network, twitch.tv slash VOG Network. And for the folks that are

14
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:36,000
watching on Twitch tonight, you're dressed up a little bit. You're doing a little Meg from Dead

15
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,960
by Daylight inspired look here. And so you're committed to your art with the jacket there. I am.

16
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:45,120
Love that. The funny thing is that I had ordered this like cheap ass terrible jacket,

17
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:52,080
and then I found this actual legit corduroy jacket. And that's what Meg wears. And I'll link

18
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:57,520
like the cosmetic. And then I got my wig and my wig's the wrong color because it's not like

19
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:04,080
red enough. I either have a very red wig or the blonde wig. Out of my collection of wigs,

20
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:10,160
I do not own a strawberry blonde. And I had everything ready and styled. And then I was

21
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:18,560
just looking at my, uh, just Meg cosmetics and Meg has a Bob hair, a Bob haircut. That

22
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:23,280
it's like her athletic Bob and it looks a little bit like curly and stringy a little.

23
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:29,040
And she's also got like her straightened out one, but it's more of an ombre effect. And I was like,

24
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:33,440
yeah, this will do. Um, I just have to make sure I'm cultivating my resting bitch face

25
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:36,800
better. And she doesn't have the Klingon forehead that I do, but oh, well.

26
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:41,360
I am surprised you don't have the, because you love pig who is the killer. I'm surprised you

27
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:46,560
don't have Megan, the pig mask for your, I was just a little bit surprised. I actually,

28
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,080
uh, didn't have time to make the pig mask. I was supposed to make it. And then I had to go to

29
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:55,840
Alabama next year, next year. Yeah. Cause I was going to have like the, the pig mask hanging off

30
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:03,520
to the side. And I, I had another red wig that I was going to do like her triple braid in and

31
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:10,160
with everything that happened in the last couple of weeks. Sure. That fell off. Um, meanwhile,

32
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:14,480
I am not dressed up. I'm dressed up as Rob Roberts, uh, orange on his radio host here on stream

33
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:19,600
tonight because, uh, I w I hosted. So for the first time in 18 months, um, I've talked about

34
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:24,160
this on a show before I host, uh, with one of the film festivals here, I do a lot of the cult movie

35
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:29,920
screenings and variety show stuff. So, uh, Rocky horror was back last night after 18 months being

36
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:33,440
gone. You know, they still did precautions. Everybody had to be vaccinated. Everybody was

37
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:38,320
wearing massive stuff and it felt, it felt really good to be back, um, doing that again. Uh, and

38
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:42,720
then there was a variety show on Friday night, um, cabaret macabre, which went really, really well.

39
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:47,040
And, uh, yeah, so I dressed up for those events. So today I was like, you know what? I'm, I'm

40
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:52,320
casual tonight. Halloween is over for me. It was the weekend was the highlights there. That's for

41
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:57,680
sure. Um, and going to our chat because again, we do tape live at twitch.tv slash vog network,

42
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:03,360
where SSJ 100, Matt says to hosting gigs and you still have your voice. Yeah. I tried to keep it

43
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:08,240
under control this weekend, but I do feel like I'm an octave lower tonight than I usually am.

44
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:13,680
That's for sure. Um, speaking of spooky season, tech master, Loki, not here with us tonight,

45
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:17,600
as you can see. Uh, and for those in the podcast feed, he is not here tonight. Uh,

46
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:21,680
but he mentioned on a previous episode, he is still obligated to take the kids trick or treating

47
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:26,160
because it is Halloween. So, I mean, understandable. So he is out doing a family

48
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:30,160
stuff tonight on Halloween. We'll probably have a little bit of a shorter show tonight,

49
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:34,400
just because it is Halloween. That world series thing is going on that has a lot of people's

50
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:38,640
attention. My cat is over here in the kitchen screaming. So Lord knows what I hear him.

51
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:46,400
And he only does this. I swear you guys, he only does this when I'm doing a well are like,

52
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:51,120
or when I'm taking a shower, he'll sit, sit outside the bathroom door and screen.

53
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:55,840
So it's the song of his people, apparently my gosh. And he just ate too. What a

54
00:04:56,640 --> 00:05:03,200
fat kitty. All right. Um, Midna has lost two pounds and is now in her healthy range.

55
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:06,480
So I have worked hard on her. Glad to hear it. Let me hear it. Cause

56
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:11,440
a chunky cat is not a healthy cat. I'm just saying actually, and actually believe it or not,

57
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:16,880
Mr. Smoosh is at the weight he needs to be. It's just, his species is a natural chonker.

58
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:21,040
Oh yeah. So yeah, no, that, that's a different thing just because of how he's built,

59
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:28,480
but like Midna being a little black cat, she is supposed to be, she, she has that,

60
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:32,720
that pouch and that's actually a genetic leftover. It's not, it's not chunkiness.

61
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:38,560
Um, but she's finally where she should be and she's got a lot more energy and she's happy.

62
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:42,640
Good, good. Sometimes she has too much energy. I miss Midna. I haven't seen her in a while.

63
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:46,720
I need to come over and play pinball. We're about to, we may be selling the shadow.

64
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:52,560
Oh no. We have Star Trek now. Oh fun. Good time. And of course, pinball machines for

65
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:57,120
those that are not aware that Dar Sakura and Hubby collect pinball machines. It's fun stuff.

66
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:01,280
They sure do. Um, okay. We'll talk a little more about our week off cause I know both you and I

67
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:05,200
went on a trip except different trips. So we'll talk a little bit about that in a bit. But I

68
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:10,560
thought, you know, since we are video games, let's get into our first topic tonight, which is kind of

69
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:14,800
covering really what we missed in that week that we were off because I feel like there was more

70
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:18,480
news last week than there was this week. We had some big headlines this week. We'll get into in a

71
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:22,960
minute, but there was a bit of news, um, last week while we were off. Um, so running through some of

72
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:27,680
the big headlines, uh, Metroid dread got that patch that we had been talking about on an earlier

73
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:33,520
show. Um, so patch 1.0 0.1 and Metroid dread is now out and it fixes that, uh, you know, kind of

74
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:40,080
broken thing that prevented people from beating the game, but it was coming off. It's fine. I

75
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:44,960
understand. Not everybody was really gonna hit that anyway. Um, also this kind of interesting,

76
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:48,640
uh, the Capcom arcade stadium. I don't know if you've checked, checked this out dark soccer,

77
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:53,680
but it's a great collection of old, uh, Capcom games. And so, uh, if you want to play the one

78
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:58,160
on switch, right? Yeah. Well, it's on all of them, but switch. Yeah. Yeah. If you don't,

79
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:03,280
if you don't want to buy games in bulk, they just, uh, released that you can buy each title

80
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:08,240
separately for $2. So if you only want Strider, you only have to pay the $2 for Strider, which is

81
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:12,800
kind of nice. So, um, or whatever it is that you want to get. Meanwhile, I bought all of the

82
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:18,560
bundles on switch before they did this. I want to see them do more like there's still more games.

83
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:24,640
I want to see them put out. So hopefully it's been doing well enough. This is a huge headline in the

84
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:30,240
blizzard universe and Overwatch. Um, you know, everybody knows that there was a lot of problems

85
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:34,160
at blizzard that have had to be worked out, um, in the past few months and are continuing to be

86
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:38,720
worked on. Um, but one of them was the fact that, uh, one of the characters, the cowboy character

87
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:44,240
in Overwatch was named after somebody with the company that proved to have a pretty problematic

88
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:49,840
past. So, uh, they had said they were going to rename this character and they announced the

89
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:56,080
new name last week. Uh, the character formerly known as McCree is now Cole Cassidy is the name

90
00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:01,680
of that character. Um, and definitely, you know, butch Cassidy probably coming into play there.

91
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:08,400
But what I also think is really funny is that, um, the character of Ash voiced by O.L.R. fave

92
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:14,160
Jennifer Hale, uh, who, um, was added later on. Uh, I just think it's really funny that the

93
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:19,600
characters are Ash and Cole. Get it? Even though his name is spelled C O L E still it's Ash and

94
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:26,240
Cole. Ha ha ha ha. All right, forget it. What reference is this that I'm missing?

95
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:31,600
It's just Ash and Cole. Like, like they're both fire burning related things. I don't know.

96
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:35,920
Okay. I thought that it was like famous, like people.

97
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:41,360
No, well, the Cassidy part likely is, but that's, uh, yeah, that's it. Um,

98
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:47,760
Questbuster in chat also with another point there saying, if I recall correctly, uh, also with the

99
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:52,720
rename, Blizzard said they would stop naming characters in any of their games after real

100
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:59,200
people. You know what though? I, I, I actually, I don't know if I agree with that. And I know

101
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:03,520
that might sound surprising, especially, you know, considering this particular character, but like,

102
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:09,360
I know in world of Warcraft, they have named characters in tribute for some that have passed

103
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:15,600
away. Um, I also know some items have, uh, names from the real world. I mean, that's,

104
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:20,480
I don't know, maybe give or take, cause you never know where, you know, where those peoples are at,

105
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:26,000
but I think especially the ones that are named in memoriam, um, I would, I would like to see them

106
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,880
do that. Maybe they should amend it that they shouldn't name them after living employees or

107
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:35,120
something. Yeah. Yeah. I think that's the way to do it. Don't name them after living employees.

108
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:40,160
And I think that would be a better way to handle that. But I, I, I get like where they were going

109
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:45,920
with that for sure. I think this is a really interesting story. Hamster has filed a trademark

110
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:50,240
and yes, hamster is a game company. If you weren't already aware, and they're probably most

111
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:56,000
well known, I think they're the ones that do the arcade archives, which is a huge series, um, that

112
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:01,360
is on the Nintendo switch. And I think it's shows up on like PlayStation four, a lot of old arcade

113
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:07,200
games. Well, in the last week, they actually put out a trademark or they filed a trademark for

114
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:13,200
console archives. And I think this is really fascinating, especially if the Nintendo switch

115
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:20,240
is involved because essentially hamster. I mean, if you, if you're to jump to conclusions about

116
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:24,640
what this name means, which I don't know why you wouldn't, uh, this might mean that hamster is

117
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:30,960
putting together a third party virtual console. Wow. Of sorts. Um, you know, granted this could

118
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:36,800
include systems that are not represented on the Nintendo switch and that's probably where it's

119
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:41,600
going to end up. It couldn't, I know Konami has worked a lot with arcade archives. I think

120
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:47,280
turbo graphics 16 is a very, cause you know, Konami now that's one of the same. I think

121
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:52,000
there's a very likely place for turbo graphics things to end up, but there could be more than

122
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:57,680
just that. Um, I know SNK, although, you know, when it comes to the Neo Geo, I think pretty

123
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:02,720
much all the home stuff was the arcade stuff that was kind of the, the allure of that system.

124
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:07,680
I'm not sure what I'm not thinking of unless maybe, um, dark soccer, things like SNK pocket

125
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:11,600
and some of the things I know you followed a little more closely, maybe will be represented

126
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:17,280
here. I don't know. That would be nice. Yeah. So I don't think console archives is suddenly

127
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:22,000
going to mean things like Genesis, Nintendo and things like that. I just don't see it going that

128
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:28,800
way, especially on the switch. But I think the more obscure Japanese only type of stuff, there

129
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:33,840
actually could be a pretty cool market here. What if they started putting out like MSX and MSX too?

130
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:40,320
Like that would be rad. And I could see that happening from hamster. So, um, fingers crossed

131
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:43,840
that that's kind of where this going is really, um, bringing some of those more obscure titles

132
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:50,560
to light. So anyway, arcade archives has been running since March 3rd, 2017, 200 weeks of,

133
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:55,680
uh, systems. The last, uh, game they released was rally X, which, uh, I, I love that game.

134
00:11:55,680 --> 00:12:01,440
That's one of the few games I have a perfect achievement list, 200 out of 200 on Xbox 360

135
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:05,760
was yeah. Right. The random rally X remake. I don't know why I love that game so much,

136
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:10,560
but I do. It's weird. I'll be the first one to get it. Yeah, it is. Um, let's see,

137
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:16,880
going to chat twitch.tv slash a VOG and network, uh, SSJ 100, Matt suggesting on the, uh, naming,

138
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:23,600
uh, after people named them after pets instead for blizzards. So we could have like a Mr. Smoosh

139
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:27,760
in the, I like that idea, the pets. All right. And again, what if you have a pet that's like

140
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:37,840
named after like a person and this is Walter. Yeah. The brave. Yeah. The kind of, um, some

141
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:43,280
comments on the, uh, uh, console archive story, dark Tetsuya says, sign me up for MSX stuff.

142
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:49,280
Right. Like I know we've had a year. I know we've kind of had the metal gear release on,

143
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:55,440
but it would be really nice to have these. Oh, holy fuck. Yes. Guard it. Although you can get

144
00:12:55,440 --> 00:13:01,600
guardick on iPhone and guardick. Wasn't really a great game to say. But what if like we could

145
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:05,920
finally get guardian legend through this? I would be so excited even though that is an NES game,

146
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:10,240
but you never know. I still wish that that fan remake had been allowed to go through. That would

147
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:15,280
have been such a delight for sure. Um, quest buster and chat says, yay, more hamster retro.

148
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:20,640
I'm also keeping my fingers crossed on Japanese only classics. So many never made it here. And

149
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:24,640
yeah, I, you know, again, there's, it's a trademark. There's only so much we can do.

150
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:30,320
We can jump to conclusions, but I feel like with the arcade archives, like nothing was off limits

151
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:36,320
for hamster. If you really look at the, I mean, they've released 200 games. There's a lot of

152
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:41,280
obscure shit in there. Like let's be real. So like if they can do this for console games too,

153
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:46,720
I think it's going to be awesome. Like in kudos to them for, um, preserving, you know, these,

154
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:52,400
these, uh, obscure sometimes gaming history. Maybe they'll use dark soccer's classic game of the week

155
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:57,040
list on our Wiki as a guide of what we want to see. So you think we're going to get like puzzling

156
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:06,000
does, uh, miss nude world 96. If there's any justice, everybody move your body, move your

157
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:12,480
body. Okay. One of the greatest in jokes ever on this show is miss nude world 96. Yes. It is

158
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:18,480
an actual game. It plays just like kicks Q I X. If you remember that game place, just like that.

159
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:26,400
But instead of just filling in colored squares, you unlock a scantily clad woman. Cause you know,

160
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:32,640
games were like, really fucking, you know, sometimes they were really misogynistic in the

161
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:40,640
nineties. Yeah. Who doesn't, um, but then for whatever reason, sometimes the game would like,

162
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:45,120
you do something bad, I guess. And then suddenly it turns into a picture of a hell demon.

163
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:50,720
And it plays this really cheesy techno song in the background that goes, everybody move your body.

164
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:56,880
So I don't know if there's any clips on YouTube, but seriously look it up. It's, it's hilarious.

165
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:01,920
It's just, it's hilarious how ridiculous it is. It is a fucking ridiculous game,

166
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:08,960
but that's why we can't stop talking about it. All right. Dark Tetsuya is saying, I don't know,

167
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:13,440
the ESRB might not be kind to miss nude world. Okay. You know what they have to do?

168
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:20,000
Let me ESRB can bite my ass here. Here we go. They I'm going to refer to a really obscure news

169
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,320
story from this week. So going back to this week, I don't know if you guys heard, but there's,

170
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:28,480
there's a trailer out there for a really, and I'm going to be honest, the game looks like garbage.

171
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:33,840
It looks like a ripoff of super meat boy, quite frankly. Um, and it's called on the Nintendo

172
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:38,080
switch. It's called, I think it's called 20 women. Somebody in chat can correct me if you know what

173
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:43,600
I'm talking about. And basically by beating these crappy levels, you unlock pictures of

174
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:50,400
scantily clad women who are way wearing basically bathing suits that show off their big assets.

175
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:55,840
Okay. So there's that, but on the PlayStation, they were not able to release this game the same

176
00:15:55,840 --> 00:16:02,560
way. So instead they made a game called 20 bunnies. And at the end of each level,

177
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:07,040
you unlock pictures of cute bunnies. They're not scant and clad or anything. They're just

178
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:13,680
cute bunnies, right? The bunnies are better. Now this game looks like fucking garbage,

179
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:18,480
so I'm not going to buy it just for pictures of bunnies, but to go back to miss world,

180
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:24,160
miss nude world 96. That is how you release the game is you do miss bunny 96

181
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:30,960
and that's how hamster can do it. Thank you. That's funny. Pixel pockets knew what I was

182
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:34,800
talking about. Turn the ladies into bunnies. Yes. Thank you. Tiger claw got the real name

183
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:38,800
of the game. It's called 20 ladies, not 20 women. Sorry about that. 20 ladies

184
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:43,680
and a links to a story that Nintendo life ran on the whole thing. So anyway,

185
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:49,520
quest buster and chat says cute bunnies for everyone, right? Pod culture says bunnies

186
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:57,440
aren't just cute likes everyone. Everybody suppose. All right. Anyway, where was I? Let

187
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:01,440
me go back to the headlines from last week. Cause I know I've missed some things here.

188
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:05,760
I accidentally closed the window. Um, getting back to it.

189
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:12,080
I have to log into my site again to see my headlines. Okay. Here we go.

190
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:20,480
Uh, fun times. Oh, um, RIP. We did love a radio. We did lose, um, uh, pixel artists from Namco,

191
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:25,920
very famous pixel artists. Hiroshi Ono passed away in the week that we were gone. Yeah. So,

192
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:28,880
I mean, I didn't mean that as a pun and I'm sorry I said it that way, but I meant,

193
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:35,680
Oh, no, legit. Yeah. So, yeah. Uh, sorry to hear about that loss. Um, that is unfortunate. And,

194
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:41,200
uh, also in the news, we have, uh, the next game from the Stardew Valley creator

195
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:46,080
is going to be haunted chocolatier. So that sounds like it could be very interesting. I wonder if

196
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:50,240
it'll be as chill as Stardew Valley is. I don't know when they're talking about haunted. I'm not

197
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:54,960
sure if it's really going to be chill, but we'll see. So those are some of the big headlines we

198
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:59,120
missed last week in the week that we were off. So speaking of the week we were off,

199
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:03,360
let's talk about our gaming weeks and the types of video games that we have been playing this week.

200
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:06,960
I have to interject something. Sure. Go ahead.

201
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:10,880
Steve Buscemi just went Halloween. He dressed as his meme.

202
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:15,920
Uh, how do you do fellow kids? That one. Exactly. He dressed as his meme.

203
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:20,960
I love it. And handed out candy. Uh, I heard what's her name from the movie Midsommar,

204
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:25,360
which I know you love that movie Florence something. Uh, she dressed up as her character

205
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:28,240
for Midsommar for Halloween. I have to find pictures of that.

206
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:34,240
It's on Twitter somewhere. All right. Uh, let's get into our gaming weeks and with our gaming

207
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:37,680
weeks. Um, I figured we might talk about the trips a little bit because I know,

208
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:41,120
I don't know about you dark soccer, but I kind of played less games this week because I went

209
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:44,960
out of town for a few days, but, um, I don't know. Tell us, tell us about your trip and your gaming

210
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:50,320
week, dark soccer. So, yeah, I didn't really play a lot of games, although, um, of course the Monday

211
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:56,720
last I played, uh, uh, I tried to, I tried to keep up with my streaming and I did some dead

212
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:03,600
by daylight. Um, and I, I did not play Fantasian because the new content I thought was coming out

213
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:11,680
on that Tuesday and I was wrong. Um, so it's really was dead by daylight. Um, playing, uh,

214
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:16,800
word scapes, um, really not much of anything. I'm going to be starting at animal crossing again when

215
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:26,000
the new DLC is out. Um, and, uh, as expected, uh, JD did, uh, change our family plan. So I

216
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:30,880
have access to all the N64 stuff now and that's pretty fun. Um, I don't know if I'm going to play

217
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:36,720
anything yet, but I really have hardly had time to do anything. My, my cosplay is so half-assed

218
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:43,200
because I didn't have time to do anything. Um, I, I was in Alabama. Um, I didn't play any games in

219
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:53,440
Alabama. Um, uh, uh, Tiara and I went to go, uh, spend time with our mama son, Maggie. Um,

220
00:19:53,440 --> 00:20:01,440
and we went to, uh, Barbara's, uh, Memorial, um, was really sweet. Um, there, there was a lot of

221
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:10,000
uncomfortable Christian stuff, but it's not my deal. Um, and there was this cute picture of,

222
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,480
uh, Barbara holding a lightsaber and I had never seen it. So it was,

223
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:23,760
I got to see some different pictures. Um, and, uh, then, uh, we caught up with some of her friends

224
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:28,800
and then they found out a big thing. You know, we had a commonality of liking electric light

225
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:35,280
orchestra and it was, it was, it was some random stuff. And then we went to olive garden, which is

226
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:42,320
fine dining for Mobile, Alabama. Um, well, there actually is, there's like a Ruth's Chris and some

227
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:48,000
other places that are nice, like the Admiral Sims and whatnot. But, um, but we went to olive garden

228
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:52,160
and had, had food and it was great. And Tiara and I stole the breadsticks.

229
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:57,440
Olive Garden is that place I really crave like once a year, like once a year, I'm like,

230
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:01,760
I want some fucking breadsticks and I want it now. We had, we had to keep upgrading our tables and

231
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,480
we were finally like, you know, we're just going to take this table over here and the stuff's like,

232
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:10,640
whatever. Sure. Um, and we had a really good time, you know, um, the happy times were happy.

233
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:15,920
We had some sad, you know, reminiscing. Um, my mother did manage to stick her foot in her

234
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:25,040
mouth when we had mom brunch, had her and Maggie for brunch with us. Um, and, uh, I was very happy

235
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:30,000
because, um, there were, there were many gays at brunch and it made me feel like I was at gay

236
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:37,280
brunch. So nice. And really good mimosas, just saying, of course. So is this place called the

237
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:41,040
August house. If anyone is in Mobile, Alabama, they're really expensive for their brunch,

238
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:45,360
but they are quite delightful. Um, we also went to this place called the cheese cottage,

239
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:48,240
which we just were like, we're going to the cheese cottage by name alone.

240
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:55,760
And it was really, really, really good. I mean, like you order a charcuterie boards and whatnot,

241
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:59,840
but they also had like really delicious sandwiches and there was a dude out there

242
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:05,680
playing guitar and he was really good, but he did the thing. He played wonder wall.

243
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:13,360
I saw this on like your Instagram or whatever. I put it on Tik TOK because that man turned himself

244
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:19,120
into a living meme. That's funny anyway. And we were singing with him. It was great. Um, but yeah,

245
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:25,680
I ended up spending, um, a good, uh, my, my, pretty much almost my whole Sunday with my mom

246
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:32,400
and I got to see my, my brother Phillip. And I finally got to meet my nephew Jackson

247
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:38,000
and Ashley was back from Afghanistan. She, um, she's army reserve, uh, medical.

248
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:42,960
And so she had just gotten back, I think like a few weeks before. Um, and then I got to see

249
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:48,160
uncle Billy and I got to see his wife, Kathy, and it was all just really nice. And Dan told

250
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:51,520
me I could pay for everybody. So that's the most I've ever paid for a meal. I'm just saying,

251
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:57,600
Oh, wow. Nice. Um, I learned something about me and my mother. I am truly her daughter.

252
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:01,120
When we went to the bar to order drinks, mom's like, I want an Amaretto and orange.

253
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:05,280
And I was like, I want an Amaretto sour. And mom's like, I've never had an Amaretto sour.

254
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:08,880
And I'm like, I've never had an Amaretto orange. So we switched drinks and actually really liked

255
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:14,640
them both. And I think this is just like some genetic taste thing that we like Amaretto and

256
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:24,160
citrusy things. So, cause we almost ordered exactly the same drink. Um, also never get an

257
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:32,800
Amaretto sour at Olive Garden. They are weak as fuck. Um, so, uh, Maggie had managed to get off

258
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:39,840
on Monday. So we spent, um, more of the time with her on Monday and then the rest of it was,

259
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:48,320
uh, me and Tiara left to our own devices. And then we, Tuesday, we drove back to Gulf port to

260
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:54,400
turn in the car and catch our flights home. Um, they had a problem with their, uh, flight coming

261
00:23:54,400 --> 00:24:00,240
out and rearrange things in such a way that we had the same flight to Gulf port. Although, um,

262
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:05,520
I had upgraded my seats already to the comfort seats. So, you know, I, which I got, which was

263
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:09,760
great on the way back. Cause I, I had free Prosecco and I drink out of the bottle because

264
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:17,840
I'm a heathen. The picture is out there. Nice. But, um, you know, and actually I watched Twitch

265
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:21,840
streaming on my flight until we hit some turbulence and the internet got kind of wonky,

266
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:27,760
but I was on, I was watching people on Twitch. I was hanging out in a Le Pen stream for a little

267
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:33,520
bit and I think I was watching, um, yeah, I was watching Nick on the way over. I was like, Hey,

268
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:38,000
I'm in the air. Alan was doing the same thing as we were going down. I five, he was trying to

269
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,360
watch it would kind of go in and out, but he was trying to watch the Twitch streams. It's funny.

270
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:46,000
That's pretty funny, but I just thought it was funny doing it from the flight. And if I had been

271
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:53,280
on like, uh, my, my, uh, my Mac book, if, if I still had it, which I sold it, then, um, I,

272
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:58,640
it would have been, you know, really funny hike. Hi, I'm streaming from 35,000 feet,

273
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:04,960
but it wouldn't have been good enough for the way I do dead by daylight. Cause I'm a stadia player.

274
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:14,800
Um, but I mean, you know, it was, it was fun. It was, I had a great time, um, for the fun times

275
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:23,520
and, you know, we're really sad for the rest of it. And, uh, um, yeah, it was just, it was just

276
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:28,000
kind of weird being back because there was things that were familiar and things that weren't and I

277
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:36,160
kind of knew where I was. And it was just this weird sort of dichotomy of this is different.

278
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:45,040
This is exactly the same. Also a shout out to, uh, yellow hammer coffee, which is sort of like,

279
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:48,320
it's kind of like the same theory as our Dutch brothers. And they're really, really good,

280
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:54,240
but they're locally owned. Y'all are great. Yellow hammer coffee. If you were in Mobile,

281
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:59,600
Alabama, you need to go. Um, I was sad that I missed my friends. I was going to meet up with,

282
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:06,960
um, with empire, uh, another, uh, dead by daylight streamer. Um, and things just didn't work out.

283
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:12,800
Um, while I was downtown though, um, there was a barcade called game over. Apparently they closed

284
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:16,960
last year cause Tara and I were like, we're going to go and they were closed. They went out of

285
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:22,720
business. Um, but other, other than that, you know, it's a little farmer's market and did some

286
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:28,400
walking around and, you know, it was just, just kind of chill. Just kind of chill. Good. Good.

287
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:33,760
Yeah. All right. No gaming happened except for watching gamers.

288
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:39,680
So I guess I'll talk about my week a little bit. Um, so I also was on a trip, although a very

289
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:44,400
different sort of trip, Alan and I took a trip down to the LA area. Anybody from NorCal pretty

290
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:48,400
much calls everything south of the great vine LA. And that's really where we were all over

291
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:54,400
different places down there. And, um, uh, we went to Disney on the day that OLR would have

292
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:59,440
been. So Sunday, we went to Disneyland, um, which I hadn't been to in almost five years.

293
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:04,160
The last time Alan and I went was the year we got married. Um, so we hadn't been in a while. So,

294
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:08,640
um, it was nice. We got there pretty early. We got there like 15 minutes after opening

295
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:12,000
and we were by ourselves for a little bit cause the rest of our peeps weren't really meeting us

296
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:17,280
for a couple hours. Um, so we walked right on all the rides and wanted to do a DCA. So we got to do

297
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:21,440
like, you know, uh, the toy story midway mania, which is a game. So I played that

298
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:25,120
and got to see some of the other changes like in credit coaster. I hadn't been on that yet.

299
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:30,160
The guardians ride was good. Yeah. I liked in credit coaster. I was, I was totally fine with

300
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:33,200
the changes and the guardians ride was pretty good. I was ready to hate it because I love

301
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:38,480
tower terror, but they did a decent job with that. I liked it. Um, credit coaster was out when I went

302
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:45,040
after drag con 2019, but I went before galaxy's edge opened. Got it. Got it. Um, yeah. And so

303
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:50,160
we did get to cross over to Disney and then it got really crowded. Now I was with my pal Victoria,

304
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:55,280
who some of you might recognize from a show I've had off and on called shaking and crying.

305
00:27:55,280 --> 00:28:00,560
And she is, you know, queen of Disney. And so she was able to get us, uh, on the queue. Cause it's

306
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:05,040
all through an app now. It's all a game in and of itself. She had to collect all our barcode numbers

307
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:09,280
and then you go on an app and that's how you get for rise of the resistance. So we did get to do

308
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:14,240
it. Um, she did a great job cause she, we only had to wait. Like I think she got in queue at noon. I

309
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:18,240
think it's the time to do it. And we got on that ride probably about two 30. So, uh, we didn't

310
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:22,480
have to wait too terribly long, all things considered. Um, so that was cool. And that's

311
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:26,560
like four rides in one. That was pretty amazing. So that was a neat ride. Um, so yeah, we had a

312
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:31,040
great Disney day, had a really good time. Um, around the trip, we got to do some other stuff

313
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:36,000
because Alan had never really spent time in Southern California outside of theme parks.

314
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,840
Um, we tried to meet up with kind of like you did. We tried to meet up with some Twitch streamers

315
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:46,000
while we were down there. Um, Nick, right. Yes. Yes. So I was going to say, um, you know, we,

316
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:50,480
we invited a few and, you know, people had other commitments or other things. I know it's always

317
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:54,320
weird too. And like people from the internet are like, hi, I know you from the internet. Do you

318
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:57,840
want to meet up? You know, and I totally get that, you know, it might be a little weird for some

319
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:03,440
people. It's fine, but it was nice that, um, we were able to make one of them work. So, um, Nick,

320
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:07,840
yeah, Nick and Prince, uh, who's a dead by daylight streamer. I'm sure we've rated in the

321
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:12,480
past long time ago before you were streaming Jamie and, uh, somebody I know you rate a lot

322
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:18,160
and I've rated too. Um, I was able to meet up with him. Uh, so we went, we met up in West Hollywood

323
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:22,960
at a cafe and just, just really just chatted, just talked about streaming a little bit and,

324
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:27,040
you know, dead by daylight and, you know, all the things you would expect, uh, some nerdy folks who

325
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:32,400
got together to talk about. So that was, that was really cool. I was nice to meet, um, a Twitch.

326
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:38,960
It was an interesting thing because, you know, having done OLR for nearly 20 years now,

327
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:44,080
it doesn't happen often, but it does happen where I meet people at conventions and stuff. And it's

328
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:48,720
kind of like, they're kind of like, it's so interesting to have watched you or mostly

329
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:52,960
listened to you for so many years. And I've never seen you for a long time before we had

330
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:56,720
the Twitch thing. It was like, I had no idea what you look like. It's interesting to see you and

331
00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:00,160
just that whole, like, they're saying, you know, I've been listening to you for so long and now

332
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:03,280
I'm seeing you in person. It's always very flattering. Right. And all that, of course,

333
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:07,120
I don't take any of that for granted, but it was interesting. That was kind of the reverse scenario

334
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:10,880
where it was like, we were meeting Nick and I don't think Nick is super familiar with this

335
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:13,920
show. Like I know he knows you and I do it and stuff, but I don't expect he listens to it,

336
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:17,760
especially when he streams Sunday nights. Fans pop up in his chat though. But it was,

337
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:22,720
it was an interesting sort of reversal where it's like, Oh, I watched Nick a lot. Like,

338
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:26,560
you know, before I go to bed or something, you know, he's a late night streamer cause he's on

339
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:30,720
the West coast. I've watched many hours of him and now we're just hanging out in person. It was

340
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:36,800
a very interesting role reversal kind of thing. So it was, it was cool. Yeah. So, uh, but yeah,

341
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:41,280
I enjoyed it and I'm glad we got to hang out. So, um, I'm sure I'll be able to meet many more

342
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:45,920
Twitch streamers at TwitchCon next year. That's the goal anyway. Let's, let's make sure TwitchCon

343
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:51,040
happens and we're able to all hang out. So, but I mean, even with COVID and everything,

344
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:55,200
things are starting to come back. It's just precautions. You have to be back. Like, um,

345
00:30:55,200 --> 00:31:00,000
I was able to host shows again this weekend. It was great. Um, and, uh, you know, we, but we had

346
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:05,840
mandatory vaccines and everybody still had to wear masks and I would hope by next fall, we're past

347
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:10,400
that, but we not might not be, but it's nice to know that TwitchCon could still happen with those.

348
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:14,640
So that would be, um, I really do want to do TwitchCon, Rob. I mean, I actually want to do

349
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:22,160
that more than DragonCon. Uh, well drag for me, DragonCon is really the big one every year, but,

350
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:26,480
um, I want to do about what, porque no los dos. That's, that's my perspective.

351
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:28,640
Because money and time off, just saying.

352
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:34,800
I get it. I get it. I get it. Uh, but I, I, I don't know. We'll see. We'll see what, uh,

353
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:38,480
ends up happening with TwitchCon and the ticket demand and all that stuff. So we'll see. Anyway,

354
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:43,760
um, as far as games that I played, yes, I did play a few games cause I streamed some Final Fantasy 14

355
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:47,440
in there somewhere. And I've still been playing that, trying to get all my characters to 80.

356
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:52,320
I'm still playing a little bit of Dead by Daylight. Um, and actually I did pick up a new

357
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:58,240
game this week. Um, so I want to talk a little bit about Pikmin Bloom because Pikmin Bloom just came

358
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:03,200
out really just a couple of days ago, I think on Thursday. And this is the latest game from Niantic,

359
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:08,320
who are the makers of Pokemon Go, Ingress. Uh, they chipped in with that Harry Potter

360
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:14,080
Wizards Unite game. Um, so this is kind of their latest offering and probably notable because it is,

361
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:19,680
uh, their only other offering with Nintendo next to Pokemon Go. So in a way it's kind of like the

362
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:23,600
sequel to Pokemon Go, I guess, or, but I shouldn't call it that cause it's a very different sort of

363
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:30,000
game. Um, so I really wasn't sure what to expect from Pikmin Bloom, but I have to admit, I find

364
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:34,560
that I'm into it more than I thought it would be because the weird thing is there isn't really

365
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:40,720
much of a game there or it doesn't seem to be, but it seems to be a really good like walking tracker

366
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:46,640
is what it really is. Um, and, uh, you know, interfaces with, um, Apple watch, Apple fitness,

367
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:52,240
as well as the Google equivalents to track the steps and where you're going. And, um,

368
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:57,680
as you're doing that, you start to ha very much uses the Pokemon Go eggs concept, which is how

369
00:32:57,680 --> 00:33:02,480
you hatch new Pikmin. And then as you level up in the beginning, it seems like there's really

370
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:06,640
nothing, but as you level up more and more starts to unfold and you get to a point where you can

371
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:11,680
send the Pikmin off on expeditions to get fruit, which they bring back and you turn those into

372
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:18,560
petals and you use the petals to plant flowers. In the world, as you walk, when you turn it on,

373
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:23,200
see, I don't plant flowers at my house. I only plant because other people can see them.

374
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:27,760
So I only plant flower flowers at the park, but you turn that on and off, um, as you want to,

375
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:32,640
but I really think the most underrated feature of Pikmin Bloom is that it keeps like a journal

376
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:37,280
for you basically. And so at the end of the day, you'll get an alert about nine o'clock that says,

377
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:41,360
check out how your day went. And it'll track like, here's the steps that you got today.

378
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:46,720
Here's a random picture from your day. Tell me how you felt today. Make any notes that you want to

379
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:51,760
make about today. And, um, any postcards that you got from friends, because at some point the

380
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:56,240
Pikmin on the expeditions get postcards and you can send those to your friends. So like, I know

381
00:33:56,240 --> 00:34:00,400
I sent one to Deft. I think I sent one to Deft. I'm pretty sure. Uh, and some other people that

382
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:04,720
are on my friends list as well. So, um, the only thing I think is a little weird is that you're

383
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:08,720
getting postcards from your friends who are all over the world, which is cool, but that doesn't

384
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:14,800
really then track the places you've been. So that's, um, a little bit interesting. Well,

385
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:20,960
then open your game Deft and send my Pikmin back by opening your postcard. No, it's all good. I

386
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:25,520
understand. Um, I was just reading a chat comment there where Deft said, I haven't opened Bloom

387
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:32,160
since Thursday. Um, is the game perfect? No, because, um, I still think I'm not sure what

388
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:36,880
the actual game is. I think there's still probably more to it as you go on. Um, the

389
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:40,800
microtransactions make no sense at all. I would never pay for any of that stuff that they're

390
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:46,560
offering. Um, and quite simply, honestly, if it's a free walking log and walking tracker,

391
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:53,040
I don't see the need to do that stuff. There's no competition. There's no scoreboard. There's no

392
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:58,320
territory control game. There's, there's no incentive to be competitive and to get

393
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:03,040
the competitive edge by buying the microtransaction stuff, which quite frankly, the number of coins

394
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:08,960
that you earn is laughable. If you think Pokemon go is bad, the number of coins you earn in Pikmin,

395
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:12,480
at least so far, we should remember it's the first release, but the number of coins you earn

396
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:18,080
in Pikmin Bloom is laughable. To put it in perspective, you get one coin when you plant

397
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:25,040
500 flowers. And that's not cumulative. You have to do it in one walk. Um, five, 500 flowers is

398
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:31,840
about the equivalent of one mile. I found you get one coin for planting flowers for one mile.

399
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:37,120
So think about that a little bit. I, so far, I think I've been doing a lot of walking.

400
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:43,680
The game has been incentivizing my walking a little bit. I'm up to six coins earned. Yay.

401
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:49,520
Yay. Exactly. I don't know what I'm going to buy with that. Not much. So I, I think there's still

402
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:54,320
a lot to work out with the microtransactions and why, why I would ever get those. Um, but I don't

403
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:57,120
know, maybe next week after I've played the game a little more, I'll have an answer for that.

404
00:35:57,120 --> 00:36:01,600
Although I will say I'm up to like level 11, which is, you know, in just a few days, I,

405
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:05,760
I think I've done pretty good, but there are people on my friends list that are higher because

406
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:12,480
of course, of course I'm friends with a lot of other very hardcore geolocation game players.

407
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:17,280
And I've, I've talked about that on the show before, how I usually am going to check out

408
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:22,320
any AR geolocation game. And of course, Niantic is the cream of the crop,

409
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:27,200
despite how you feel about Pokemon Go or their other offerings. The reality is

410
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:33,680
other companies really aren't making those same type of games. Draconius Go ain't it.

411
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:39,600
Garfield Go really ain't it. So, you know, Niantic is, is on the leading edge of that stuff.

412
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:44,960
So anyway, I do recommend Pikmin Bloom so far as just a walking, you know, track your walking,

413
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:49,600
nice little journal type of thing, just a cute little way to incentivize your walks.

414
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:55,600
But I would say don't expect much more than what it is. And to be fair, I believe Nintendo and

415
00:36:55,600 --> 00:37:02,880
Niantic have really said from the beginning, this is going to be a little bit less of a intense

416
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:07,840
game. This really is something that's kind of meant to encourage exploration and walking.

417
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:13,760
And I will say if that is the goal, they are, they are, it does encourage exploration and walking.

418
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:21,120
So I'll give it that. So, all right. SSU 100 Matt in chat says, I have a billion things tracking

419
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:25,840
my steps, so I'm good. While I'm not a Pikmin fan, I will give it a download. It really,

420
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:31,360
I'm not much of a Pikmin fan either. And I don't really see how it connects to the games at all,

421
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:36,560
except for the fact that they go off together to get fruit and they bring it back like that

422
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:40,080
is incorporated in a game, but it's not the same way that the actual Pikmin games work.

423
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:44,720
So I've never actually played a Pikmin game. It's very, well, and Pokemon Go

424
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:49,440
really isn't like the mainline Pokemon games really at all. You know, there's, there's,

425
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:54,400
I mean, the characters are the same, but that's about it. So it's interesting. Anyway,

426
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:58,880
so there you go. I did at least get to play one new game this week to talk to you guys about.

427
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:04,000
So there you go. My gaming week. All right. With that, I think we'll get into some gaming news.

428
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:08,560
Sound good, DarkSaga? I actually have a very offbeat question, Rob.

429
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:13,040
Go for it. Do you ever get people text you and they sign their texts?

430
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:16,560
Like they actually like put... Like it's a letter?

431
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:21,600
Love Rob or something at the end? Yeah. Something like that.

432
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:26,960
I have seen people sign their texts. That's ridiculous.

433
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:33,120
I see it more with work. And I don't know why that is, but usually it's coworkers I see it with.

434
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:37,280
With older people. Maybe it's a generation thing. I don't know. Maybe they think they

435
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:41,520
are writing letters. I don't know. But maybe they should also realize that we

436
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:44,640
know who they are and they don't need to sign a text.

437
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:49,120
Orin tried in chat says people just want to be formal and maybe it's that.

438
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:52,880
Well, screw that. All right.

439
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:58,480
That's just so, I mean, signing a work email is, is actually legitimate work etiquette.

440
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:02,080
Right. In a work email, the etiquette is

441
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:11,840
dear so-and-so or just so-and-so's name, body of text, sincerely or thank you or whatever so-and-so.

442
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:14,640
I've written emails. And that's in our style guide at my work.

443
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:18,480
That's fine. Because I've written emails to my team that go, hi, comma,

444
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:21,840
today can we, whatever is going on. I do this too.

445
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:29,200
If it's my team, I might be like sup team or hey team, but it always follows typical

446
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:33,200
letter structure because an email is closer to a written letter than it is to a text.

447
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:34,800
Right. Yeah, I get that. I get that.

448
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:40,560
It's just, it's like, it just is hit me because a couple of the sisters do it. And I'm just like,

449
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:44,960
top, I know it's you. We all know it's you. Everyone knows it's you.

450
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:48,240
Oh, is it like a group text thing? Is that why they're doing it?

451
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:51,280
It happened once in a group text, but there are people who do it one-on-one.

452
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:57,200
And I'm like, no, I know who you are. I know who you are.

453
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:59,120
Do you know who you are? Are you reminding yourself?

454
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:05,920
All right. Let's get into some gaming news. Love Rob. All right. Let's talk about the

455
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:10,320
PlayStation State of Play event that happened this week where they, you know, PlayStation did

456
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:14,640
their own kind of Nintendo Direct style thing where they showed some updates on news, but it

457
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:18,400
was a lot of third party stuff and not, I don't think there's really anything from here that was

458
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:22,320
like a huge, like no new Final Fantasy 16 trailer or anything like that. All right.

459
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:27,600
It was some more smaller and indie games, but that doesn't mean they're bad because there's

460
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:32,480
some really good stuff. For example, one of the games they were showing off was a game called

461
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:39,120
We Are OFK, which I think, correct me if I'm wrong chat, but isn't this the same group that

462
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:43,440
did Sayonara Wild Hearts that's putting this game together? Because if so, I'll play it just based

463
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:51,120
on that alone. It is a game that follows the pop band OFK and they are trying to navigate love,

464
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:57,200
friends, music, and so forth in their home setting of LA. And it's kind of a story centered game,

465
00:40:57,200 --> 00:41:02,720
but also with kind of music involved there. So that is something that was featured in the

466
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:10,240
PlayStation State of Play event. And I think they released, or they mentioned the release for that

467
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:17,120
as well, just 2022. I don't think we saw anything beyond that. And Def says, as far as is it the

468
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:22,720
same people? I think it is. I'm not sure though. Some other games that were shown, Deathverse was

469
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:27,920
announced for the PlayStation 4 and 5. This is a follow-up to the free-to-play title, Let It Die.

470
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:34,800
Probably one of the two big things that was shown, Bugsnax, the Isle of Bugsnax,

471
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:43,520
excuse me, the Isle of Big Snax. It's hard to get straight there, but it's Bugsnax and Big Snax.

472
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:49,360
So it's kind of like a DLC, a big expansion for Bugsnax that's coming soon. A lot of people

473
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:54,000
excited to hear about a new Star Ocean. So if you're an RPG fan, that was probably a highlight

474
00:41:54,000 --> 00:42:00,480
for you is that Star Ocean, The Divine Force is coming out in 2022. Darsaka, this might be up your

475
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:05,280
alley. King of Fighters 15. I don't know if you still follow that franchise, but King of Fighters

476
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:12,080
15 is coming for the PlayStation 4 and 5. And there's going to be an open beta test

477
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:16,880
from November 19th to the 22nd. And a new character was shown off. She looks pretty cool

478
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:22,640
called Dolores is her name. So you can check that out. And then one more game that was shown,

479
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:29,840
Little Devil Inside was shown with a new trailer. And honestly that was about it. But looking in

480
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:34,320
chat there, Quest Buster says the Star Ocean announcement was a big surprise. Yeah, I kind

481
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:37,120
of think that was the highlight for a lot of people, but I also know a lot of people that

482
00:42:37,120 --> 00:42:42,880
really love their RPG games. Def says King of Fighters 15 looks amazing. Yeah. I mean,

483
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:46,400
I check it out, especially if there's going to be an open beta. We can kind of play for free.

484
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:53,680
I'd love to check it out. Oh, Def points out too in our chat that the open beta is the same weekend

485
00:42:53,680 --> 00:43:01,600
as Pokemon Diamond and Pearl remakes are released. So yeah, well, November is always a busy month

486
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:06,640
and November literally starts tomorrow. And so the next few weeks are going to be, you know,

487
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:12,800
the big holiday releases are all for the next few weeks as we lead up to Black Friday and those

488
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:16,240
sales, you know, even with the pandemic and everything going on, it's still in the chip

489
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:22,320
shortages around the world still in the freight shortages in the harbor and all that stuff.

490
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:29,440
It still doesn't stop the holiday shopping spree. Yep. Def says Final Fantasy 14's expansion is that

491
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:34,000
same weekend. Yep. It's going to be a busy, busy time for me because, you know, you know,

492
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:39,280
I love me some Final Fantasy 14 and I will be checking out the latest expansion and Walker.

493
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:44,320
That's for sure. Anyway, so that is what you missed at State of Play or what you saw at

494
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:49,280
State of Play, depending on if you watched it or not. Let's go to Dark Sakura, I think has

495
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:57,440
other PlayStation news, right? I do. So they have formed a new label specifically for PC gaming.

496
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:08,080
In fact, some Steam users might've noticed that there were PC releases that switched from

497
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:15,200
PlayStation mobile to PlayStation PC LLC. And according to a corporation Wiki listing,

498
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:22,560
Sony Interactive Entertainment registered PlayStation PC in April this year from its

499
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:29,120
California headquarters. It's a bit more of a formality on there, but it's for doing,

500
00:44:29,120 --> 00:44:36,640
for how they're releasing their PC ports, including so far Horizon Zero Dawn and Days Gone.

501
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:46,160
Mm-hmm. Looking also, it seems like they're also going to be doing Uncharted 4 and Uncharted Lost

502
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:55,680
Legacy and God of War is going to have a PC port as well. Sackboy, A Big Adventure may also be

503
00:44:55,680 --> 00:45:03,280
coming to PC according to Steam's database and that they are still working on bringing out more

504
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:13,680
titles as they evaluate it. So I guess this is official. Yeah. And some people feel some sort

505
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:18,240
of way about the fact that these Sony exclusive games are now coming out for PC. So they're a

506
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:22,640
little less exclusive, but I don't know why people get really hung up on that. Number one,

507
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:27,760
none of these games have released same day and date. It's not like how Microsoft does it.

508
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:32,480
God of War, I think that was actually one of the announcements from the week we were gone as well.

509
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:39,040
That game is coming out January of 2022. That's years after the game first came out. We're not

510
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:43,280
talking about Ragnarok. We're talking about the reboot God of War game that came out some time

511
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:49,600
ago. So it's been years, even Days Gone was at least a year. A lot of these games are taking

512
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:55,680
their sweet time and coming to PC. So I don't think Sony fans should get too bent out of shape

513
00:45:55,680 --> 00:46:01,360
about it. Plus the other thing to remember is that games that release on the PlayStation 5,

514
00:46:01,360 --> 00:46:06,640
they are optimized for the PlayStation 5. When you take them to a PC, they're going to play

515
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:12,320
differently depending on the PC. Yes, some will run better. Probably not, unless you have a really

516
00:46:12,320 --> 00:46:16,320
high end machine and you've been able to get one of those really uber graphics cards. You'll

517
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:19,760
probably get PlayStation 4 quality, but you're going to have to have a real, which some of you

518
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:24,640
do have a top of the line PC, I'm sure. And you will get PlayStation 5 quality out of your games,

519
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:30,880
but most people probably won't. So you'll still kind of get that better experience on PlayStation

520
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:36,000
5, unless you've really made an investment in your PC. Now, of course, PC games means

521
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:42,480
mods. That's exciting for a lot of people, but I think we also have to realize while, you know,

522
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:48,080
you and I that listen to the show, we might enjoy the occasional mod. Most people don't bother with

523
00:46:48,080 --> 00:46:54,720
mods. So it's kind of a non-factor when it comes to, you know, releasing games on PC and so forth.

524
00:46:54,800 --> 00:47:04,080
So, but you know what? I'm also, I can see where Sony, it is strategically smart for them to put

525
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:09,600
out something like God of War on PC to get more people into that series. And the other thing to

526
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:15,680
keep in mind about Steam, which is huge versus Sony's other reach is that Steam is in way more

527
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:22,400
countries than PlayStation officially is otherwise. So being able to play the games on PC may be the

528
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:28,240
only way in some countries for people to, I suppose, legally or affordably would probably

529
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:34,560
be the better word, play these games and something to consider as well. So Quest Buster in chat says,

530
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:38,720
can't wait for the God of War mod that turns Baldur into Thomas the Tank Engine. Yes. You,

531
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:43,920
you know, it's a nudie mods, topless mods, all of it, all of it will happen. It's always going

532
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:51,520
to happen. Of course, Thomas and Randy, the Macho Man Savage mod. Absolutely. Or should I say,

533
00:47:51,520 --> 00:48:04,320
yeah. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. All right. Um, moving on. Moving on. Let's talk about the latest in

534
00:48:04,320 --> 00:48:10,080
Blizzard, which, um, you know, I've been saying on this show, fuck sake. I've been saying on

535
00:48:10,080 --> 00:48:15,680
the show for weeks and weeks that, um, it has been X number of days since the letter from the ABK

536
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:22,880
employees has gone unresponded to. It should be noted that this week, most of it was addressed.

537
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:27,200
Um, you know, Bobby Kotick did put out another statement where, you know, he was like, oh,

538
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:31,040
I'm going to take a salary cut, although he's certainly not losing any of his investments.

539
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:36,240
So is he really taking a salary cut? However, him taking a salary cut, I don't think was in

540
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:42,880
the letter. What was in the letter were things like, um, ending arbitration for some of these,

541
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:49,120
types of disagreements that was finally agreed to. They will end forced arbitration for that.

542
00:48:49,120 --> 00:48:53,680
Um, a commitment to diversity in hiring to get, um, and I forget the exact percentage. I'm sorry

543
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:58,800
guys, but something about a certain percentage of women, non-binary, you know, folks in the

544
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:04,560
workplace as well. Um, so Activision did make some more of those commitments. Um, you know,

545
00:49:04,560 --> 00:49:10,320
you can, they didn't, they didn't do everything in the letter. Um, but you know, if you look at the,

546
00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:16,240
ABK employee, you know, effort, Twitter, a better ABK, the Twitter account, they do, they do,

547
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:20,800
they did say today was a victory for us, but there's still more to do. Of course, this is,

548
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:23,600
this is something that's just going to magically disappear because, you know,

549
00:49:23,600 --> 00:49:29,120
Activision agreed to some of the demands. It is ongoing, but it is, it is nice that finally

550
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:36,240
we have some resolution and there are, you know, um, for example, uh, I, there is still not a

551
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:41,840
unbiased company audit going in because the company that's doing the audit is what remembers

552
00:49:41,840 --> 00:49:45,920
has, is tied to all those union busting, busting things. Talked about that on the show before.

553
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:50,960
Um, it's, it's, they're still involved with that. And so the employees do not consider that a win.

554
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:54,400
So there are still things that they are fighting for. Um, and I think that's important to point

555
00:49:54,400 --> 00:50:03,520
out. So, um, now amongst all of this, a pretty huge headline this week out of blizzard, um,

556
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:09,440
BlizzCon line was scheduled to happen in early 2022, just like they did this year,

557
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:16,480
the virtual BlizzCon event in 2021. However, this week that event was canceled. There is not going

558
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:22,800
to be a BlizzCon 2022, and that is kind of a shocker, um, for, you know, uh, well, well,

559
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:28,400
I don't, is it a shocker? Maybe it's not. I kind of think it is. Um, but at the same time, I also

560
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:34,560
get that blizzard has a lot of polarizing things going on. Now, if you think about the last time

561
00:50:34,560 --> 00:50:39,680
they had a BlizzCon in person, they had those protests going on outside. Remember? Because

562
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:45,680
that was right around the time that, um, they had banned the e-sports guy for saying free Hong Kong.

563
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:50,880
Remember all that stuff that was, that was leading into BlizzCon 2019. So now, not that

564
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:55,200
I'm saying they closed out of fear of protests or anything like that, but obviously with everything

565
00:50:55,200 --> 00:51:01,280
going on, I think there was probably some concern about was, was it going to be as well received of

566
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:08,800
an event? Um, and I think it's also important to consider that Blizzard's been losing a lot of their

567
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:18,560
hardcore fans, um, from this news, from the, uh, I'll just, I'm sorry to say it this way, but I'm

568
00:51:18,560 --> 00:51:22,880
just going to be candid. The failure of the World of Warcraft expansion. I don't know how else to

569
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:27,760
phrase it, but the World of Warcraft expansion went over like a poop. Like it's not winning

570
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:33,840
people over. People are going to new world, final fantasy 14, or just playing something else. World

571
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:41,200
of Warcraft is hemorrhaging players. And that was like the core audience of BlizzCon. And so you add

572
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:46,480
this, that into that. It's a danger. And here's the other thing to consider. And maybe Blizzard

573
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:51,040
had to consider this as well. What are they going to announce in early 2022?

574
00:51:54,240 --> 00:51:58,960
What do they have to show? I hope not because I have friends that work there and I want to make

575
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:05,040
sure that they're still taken care of, but, um, I think the reality is Blizzard probably doesn't

576
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:12,160
have much to show. They might have an update on Diablo four. Um, they, I have a feeling

577
00:52:13,120 --> 00:52:17,520
they're taking a real good look at World of Warcraft right now. And maybe I think we were

578
00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:22,880
all expecting that a World of Warcraft expansion would be announced. Maybe they're going to push

579
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:26,880
that back a little bit because they have to take a good fucking hard look at that game right now and

580
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:32,400
where it's at. Because exactly whatever they do with the next expansion is likely their last

581
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:39,120
chance to salvage that game. So they're probably having to have a real long conversation about

582
00:52:39,120 --> 00:52:42,880
that whole thing. Um, and the other thing to consider is that, you know, when it comes to

583
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:48,320
Blizzcon stuff, Blizzard could put out a press release tomorrow that says, Hey, StarCraft three

584
00:52:48,320 --> 00:52:52,640
is coming in 2022 and everybody would be talking about it. Everybody would cover it. You know,

585
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:57,600
maybe that they've reached that point of Nintendo or Sony state of play or what have you, where it's

586
00:52:57,600 --> 00:53:01,040
just like, you know what, we're just going to announce the news. We don't need to have this.

587
00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:05,920
We don't need to have Metallica perform with the news, especially in an online only environment

588
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:09,360
when we're not still doing conventions. What if Metallica sang the news?

589
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:13,600
I'd be there for that. I'd be, I would totally be there for that.

590
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:18,560
I should point out Blizzard did note in the cancellation notice, uh, they're going to take

591
00:53:18,560 --> 00:53:23,280
time to reimagine Blizzcon saying whatever the event looks like in the future, we would also

592
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:29,440
need to ensure that it feels as safe, welcoming and inclusive as possible. You might remember

593
00:53:30,080 --> 00:53:35,680
some of that, uh, discussion about Blizzard was about the behavior of some of the employees at

594
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:40,800
Blizzcon and some of the things they were saying about cosplay entrance behind their back. And I

595
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:50,160
hate to say it, but the Cosby suite, which we all know was a problem. So that all also plays into

596
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:56,320
what they really have to look at with Blizz, Blizzcon and all of that. So I don't, I, so I,

597
00:53:56,320 --> 00:54:02,640
I don't know. Like I'm kind of like, it is a bummer to see, I think when you really put your

598
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:08,080
brain to it, it makes sense why they're doing it. And maybe they just need to back burner it

599
00:54:08,080 --> 00:54:12,400
until we're talking about coming. Here's the interesting thing. If Blizzcon, they wanted

600
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:17,520
to do it in person, they probably could. With precautions, of course, vaccinations,

601
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:21,680
mass not stuff, especially when we're talking about early next year, they probably could do

602
00:54:21,680 --> 00:54:26,480
an in-person event if they wanted. But I understand why that's a lot of money. They're not wanting to

603
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:30,560
pony up right now with everything else going on. And maybe they just want to take a back seat

604
00:54:30,560 --> 00:54:35,760
and see how drip feeding the information goes a little bit. And I think Blizzard has to ask

605
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:41,680
themselves the really hard question. How do we win our community back? Yeah.

606
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:46,400
I'm not even sure. It's going to take a lot. I really think it's going to take a lot. It's

607
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:51,840
going to take a lot. I'm not sure I have an easy answer for that. You know, um, listening,

608
00:54:51,840 --> 00:54:57,280
listening to the employee demands, it's a start, but I think we also have to kind of see the

609
00:54:57,280 --> 00:55:03,280
actions behind that, of course. And again, you know, with World of Warcraft, which was really

610
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:08,400
a community building game for them, with that really not taking off this last expansion,

611
00:55:09,600 --> 00:55:12,560
they have to seriously reevaluate World of Warcraft. And I think.

612
00:55:14,320 --> 00:55:20,880
I think there's a very good possibility the next direction may be a World of Warcraft two

613
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:26,720
or just a Warcraft four and taking that franchise in a completely new direction.

614
00:55:27,520 --> 00:55:32,320
Um, but I don't know, but again, Blizzard takes so long to make games, which I understand,

615
00:55:32,320 --> 00:55:36,560
you know, a good game takes a long time. But even if Blizzard were to think, okay,

616
00:55:36,560 --> 00:55:41,040
we're going to start Warcraft four, we need to do a Warcraft four. Even if they like came out today

617
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:47,280
and said Warcraft four is happening, that game would not be out until 2026. Yeah. Let's be real.

618
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:53,600
Let's be real. Remember the Blizzcon? They got absolutely shit on destroyed for that Diablo three

619
00:55:53,600 --> 00:56:00,800
mobile phone game. Don't you all have phones? That was Blizzcon 2018, right? Somebody in chat,

620
00:56:00,800 --> 00:56:08,320
correct me if I'm wrong. Wasn't the mobile phone Diablo 2018. That game is still not out.

621
00:56:11,120 --> 00:56:16,400
It's Blizzard takes. I almost feel like this is the thing Blizzard has to work on.

622
00:56:17,600 --> 00:56:22,480
And it's such a weird thing to say, because I know that a good game takes time. It takes a

623
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:28,080
lot of work. Blizzard has to get faster at this. They, they, they, they cannot afford to be slow

624
00:56:28,080 --> 00:56:33,440
right now. And I it's, it's, it's a shitty situation. I completely will say here and say

625
00:56:33,440 --> 00:56:38,720
it's, it's a no win situation for them, but they have to put out something good and they have to

626
00:56:38,720 --> 00:56:48,080
do it soon. If Diablo four is bad, I really fear for the future. And that's going to be very sad.

627
00:56:49,040 --> 00:56:53,600
Anyway. All right, let's move on. Dark Sakura. How about a money story?

628
00:56:54,800 --> 00:56:58,080
Well, it makes me want to go through my own collection officially now.

629
00:56:59,360 --> 00:57:06,960
But there's another issue of a sealed Nintendo property that has gone for some money. This is

630
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:12,800
a copy of Super Mario Brothers two, known in Japan as Super Mario USA, which was also originally

631
00:57:12,880 --> 00:57:23,120
doki-doki panic. And it sold its near mint inbox, everything. It was part of a, a estate sale

632
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:31,520
in Floyd's knobs, Indiana, and it sold for $88,000. So.

633
00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:38,240
Now this wasn't related to all that other, like, remember that hour long YouTube expose

634
00:57:38,240 --> 00:57:42,160
on the auctions and the game. This isn't related to that, right? I mean, I guess.

635
00:57:42,800 --> 00:57:46,960
It was only $88,000 and not several million. So yes. Yeah.

636
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:48,080
Only $88,000.

637
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:56,080
So, um, pod culture says, Holy crap. That's right near me. Yeah. Small world, small world.

638
00:57:56,080 --> 00:58:00,000
So, so dark soccer, you think you might have some, do you think you have anything

639
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:06,000
unopened in the vault? Oh, I know I do. Oh, wow. Okay. That could be interesting.

640
00:58:06,800 --> 00:58:16,400
It's, um, we have a few more, like more some peace, some, uh, uh, like PS one or PS two,

641
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:20,880
like my copy of guitar room man was sealed for a long time. Cause I had a couple of them.

642
00:58:21,840 --> 00:58:28,000
Um, none of my Ness or SNES stuff is, but I do have a couple of really good copies

643
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:34,160
with the box of like mighty final fight. Um, which goes for a decent bit. Now, um,

644
00:58:34,160 --> 00:58:38,560
I have final fight guy in the box. It's not the original box, but I have the box and in certain

645
00:58:38,560 --> 00:58:46,960
manual for a final fight guy. Um, I have Ninja Gaiden trilogy in the box, um, which goes for

646
00:58:46,960 --> 00:58:50,960
a bit, a pretty penny. Um, if anyone wants to make me offers on these, by the way,

647
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:55,440
make me offers, cause we'll probably sell them now. We need to make some room and

648
00:58:55,440 --> 00:58:59,600
I have things I want to buy. I think the only thing I have still see,

649
00:58:59,600 --> 00:59:03,520
I have a sealed copy of like DDR X two or something like that with a dance mat.

650
00:59:05,040 --> 00:59:09,200
In the studio for whatever random re I think, I don't know. I think I got, it was a promo or

651
00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:14,640
something, but yeah, it's just funny. Remember when, remember what was that place called

652
00:59:14,640 --> 00:59:21,280
that was like, um, on North gate by where I used to work. And it was like one of those

653
00:59:21,280 --> 00:59:26,400
big warehouse stores, not like a big lots, but, but like a resale place. Oh yeah, yeah,

654
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:30,640
yeah. I know what you're talking about, but it's, it's, it's like a big lots. Yeah. And Dan and I

655
00:59:30,720 --> 00:59:36,320
bought every single last copy of the first U S release of dance, dance revolution with the pad

656
00:59:36,320 --> 00:59:39,920
so that we could sell them to our friends who were having trouble buying them. Yeah. Yeah.

657
00:59:40,560 --> 00:59:43,360
And we got them dirt cheap and they were still fairly new.

658
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:52,320
And yeah, I, I remember that craziness, but we should have a note, see if it's worth anything.

659
00:59:52,320 --> 00:59:55,600
I mean, shit, have an open, have an opening party. If it's not, you never know.

660
00:59:56,160 --> 00:59:59,920
All right. Um, let's move on and talk about one of my least favorite companies in the world.

661
00:59:59,920 --> 01:00:04,800
Probably my least favorite company in the world. Uh, Facebook, Facebook had a big, uh, event of

662
01:00:04,800 --> 01:00:10,320
their own this week and they announced the big rebranding. So Facebook as the top level

663
01:00:10,320 --> 01:00:14,880
organization is now going to be called Metta. And I think a lot of you guys heard about this

664
01:00:14,880 --> 01:00:20,240
new name. So their new name is Metta. Um, which, um, I think they should apologize to Metta world

665
01:00:20,240 --> 01:00:24,720
peace, who is the only person allowed to use that name. However, that's what they're going with.

666
01:00:24,720 --> 01:00:28,720
So Metta is to Facebook. What kind of like alphabet is to Google in a way. So basically

667
01:00:28,720 --> 01:00:34,240
like Metta is going to be the parent organization that, you know, Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp,

668
01:00:34,240 --> 01:00:40,160
um, and all this, uh, Oculus basically are all going to roll up as separate companies under

669
01:00:40,160 --> 01:00:43,840
Metta. So they're trying to create this illusion that they are separating the companies. Cause you

670
01:00:43,840 --> 01:00:48,080
know, there's all this call for like breakup Facebook and all this stuff. Well, they're just

671
01:00:48,080 --> 01:00:54,080
kind of throwing it all under this, uh, umbrella of Metta. Um, however, the one good news out of

672
01:00:54,080 --> 01:00:59,760
this is with all of this change, uh, one of the Oculus quests, most, uh, controversial features

673
01:00:59,760 --> 01:01:04,000
is going to be going away. Um, I'm not talking about the name, although that is apparently

674
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:08,160
changing too. The Oculus quest will now be the meta quest apparently is going to be a thing.

675
01:01:08,720 --> 01:01:13,920
However, you're no longer going to need a Facebook account to use them. And that was one of the big

676
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:18,480
sticking points for a lot of people. I know, uh, our own Bobby Black Wolf here at VOG network,

677
01:01:18,480 --> 01:01:26,480
who is a VR guru of many sorts. He would not get the new Oculus headsets because you had to have

678
01:01:26,480 --> 01:01:31,600
a Facebook login to get in them. And it was really stupid because if you got banned on Facebook,

679
01:01:31,600 --> 01:01:36,800
which we know it's really easy to end up in Facebook jail these days, you can, you can ask

680
01:01:36,800 --> 01:01:43,840
certain friend of ours that are there that are Facebook jail frequent flyers. Okay. That if you

681
01:01:43,840 --> 01:01:48,080
got banned from Facebook, you would basically get banned from Oculus and lose access to all of your

682
01:01:48,080 --> 01:01:53,920
games, which is the stupidest thing I think I've ever heard. So, um, you know, cause people can

683
01:01:53,920 --> 01:02:00,640
also get banned over their names. So what if you are somebody like me who uses a fake name

684
01:02:00,640 --> 01:02:06,640
everywhere online, because you've had stalkers in the past that you do not want finding you online,

685
01:02:06,640 --> 01:02:12,560
but Facebook feels the need to play God and make people go by their real names. Let's say I get

686
01:02:12,560 --> 01:02:17,760
banned from Facebook because I refuse to use my real name. Then, then what I would lose all these

687
01:02:17,760 --> 01:02:23,760
games and stuff, which is stupid. So thankfully the stupid rule is going to be changing and now

688
01:02:23,760 --> 01:02:28,800
they will be. So apparently if you are a dick bag on the Oculus service, you could still lose

689
01:02:28,800 --> 01:02:32,960
access to everything. However, that's a little more in line with steam and other shops. And I

690
01:02:32,960 --> 01:02:40,400
get that that's fine. So I just don't think it should have been tied to Facebook. So, um, CTO

691
01:02:40,400 --> 01:02:47,360
Andrew Boz Bozworth, uh, said we're working on new ways to log into quests that won't require

692
01:02:47,360 --> 01:02:53,120
a Facebook account landing sometime next year. This is one of our highest priority areas of work

693
01:02:53,120 --> 01:02:59,600
internally. So that's nice, I guess. Um, anyway, they, I just hope that they're changing cause

694
01:02:59,600 --> 01:03:04,400
they knew how harmful their platform was and did jack shit about it. Cause they were making money.

695
01:03:06,400 --> 01:03:11,360
Nothing is going to get me to go back to using that. And I only still have my messenger because

696
01:03:11,920 --> 01:03:16,320
I have need for it. That's it. I said, well, messengers practically replaced email now,

697
01:03:16,320 --> 01:03:20,320
which sucks. I don't like it, but it is what it is. You know, some of my conversations have

698
01:03:20,320 --> 01:03:24,960
moved to signal though, which is nice, but there's still a signal because here's the reality. Here's

699
01:03:24,960 --> 01:03:30,080
the reality. You guys all know I do these hosting gigs and stuff like that. All of those gigs that

700
01:03:30,080 --> 01:03:34,800
I book are through Facebook messenger. If I stop using messenger, people are not going to offer

701
01:03:34,800 --> 01:03:37,920
me gigs because they're not going to know how to get ahold of me because that is just the sad

702
01:03:37,920 --> 01:03:44,400
reality of how the firm grip that Facebook as well as messenger and all that have on this society.

703
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:48,080
I mean, we talked about this. We talked about this a few weeks ago with the shutdown when,

704
01:03:48,080 --> 01:03:52,160
you know, people were saying, don't joke about that because in other countries, WhatsApp is

705
01:03:52,160 --> 01:03:57,520
their primary form of communication to which I'm sitting here going. It is absolutely valid to then

706
01:03:57,520 --> 01:04:06,080
ask the question, why are they relying on WhatsApp? Don't tell me what I can and can't criticize.

707
01:04:06,720 --> 01:04:15,280
Fuck you. Criticism is essential by the way, to any sort of change. Yes. And if something isn't good,

708
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:21,120
especially if it's something that you enjoy or love, you must always be critical of the

709
01:04:21,120 --> 01:04:26,080
things that you love instead of taking them at face value. Absolutely. Absolutely. Absolutely.

710
01:04:26,080 --> 01:04:30,560
And that is, that is everything, you know, cause over the years, over the years, I've can't tell

711
01:04:30,560 --> 01:04:35,440
you how many times I've heard, do you guys hate Nintendo? You guys are so critical of Nintendo,

712
01:04:35,440 --> 01:04:38,160
especially Loki, always yells at Nintendo and all this stuff. And I'm like,

713
01:04:39,840 --> 01:04:43,520
we're critical cause we love them. And I've used the top model story a hundred times. I

714
01:04:43,520 --> 01:04:48,560
need a new analogy, but the reality, we are critical because we love them and we don't

715
01:04:48,560 --> 01:04:53,040
understand some of these decisions. Sometimes we feel like it hinders their success. But then

716
01:04:53,040 --> 01:04:59,200
again, look at the family plan. I thought, sorry, not the family plan, the expansion pack for

717
01:04:59,200 --> 01:05:04,320
Nintendo online. I thought for sure, Oh, this is going to, this is going to be a big poop.

718
01:05:04,320 --> 01:05:08,880
This is going to land like a thud. Nobody's going to get everybody's fucking getting it.

719
01:05:09,520 --> 01:05:13,360
Everybody's fucking getting it because either they're on a family plan where one person wants

720
01:05:13,360 --> 01:05:17,360
it, which I think is what happened to you, dark Sakura, or, um, people just have a moment of

721
01:05:17,360 --> 01:05:20,880
weakness or whatever. They're like, Oh, I'll get it just to check it out. So this thing is going

722
01:05:20,880 --> 01:05:25,680
to be a huge success for Nintendo. And it's just going to encourage them to make more questionable

723
01:05:25,680 --> 01:05:33,040
value offerings in the future. Anyway, uh, go ahead. Some comments in chat, tiger con chat

724
01:05:33,040 --> 01:05:36,720
says we're critical of Nintendo because they're going against the grain and not following what

725
01:05:36,720 --> 01:05:41,520
everyone else is doing. But see, sometimes that can end up being a good thing. Like the Nintendo

726
01:05:41,520 --> 01:05:45,920
directs and them stopping the traditional E3. You know what? That worked out real well for them.

727
01:05:46,560 --> 01:05:50,160
The their wacky approach to hardware and what they did with the switch

728
01:05:50,880 --> 01:05:54,160
is very different from what anyone else is doing and look how well it's worked out for them.

729
01:05:54,240 --> 01:05:57,920
So sometimes they go against the grain. It's a really good thing. And I will still die on

730
01:05:57,920 --> 01:06:04,640
the Hill that Nintendo is the best game maker in the business period. Nintendo just has this unique

731
01:06:04,640 --> 01:06:09,680
position of creating their own hardware as the only place to play those games.

732
01:06:11,520 --> 01:06:16,800
And some of the decisions that go along with that. Anyway, as Joe and Hunter Matt also points out,

733
01:06:16,800 --> 01:06:20,640
the show has been critical of each major console maker at one point or another.

734
01:06:20,720 --> 01:06:26,240
Folks weren't here during the PS3 era when we play show tunes when Sony put out ridiculous news

735
01:06:26,240 --> 01:06:32,480
during that time. Absolutely. And Don Matrick announcing the Xbox one. Holy shit was that

736
01:06:32,480 --> 01:06:38,240
year's worth of content. So we were critical of everybody when they deserve it. It's because we

737
01:06:38,240 --> 01:06:43,120
love video games and we want to see the gaming companies do better. Well, see, that's the thing.

738
01:06:43,120 --> 01:06:50,000
And I'm going to just go a little bit tangential on this. Sure. There are people who, when you're

739
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:55,520
critical about something, they're going to say, they're going to, you know, say, why are you a

740
01:06:55,520 --> 01:07:01,280
hater? Blah, blah, blah. And women get this a lot when we try to bring up things that are done

741
01:07:01,280 --> 01:07:06,880
against us. Oh, well, why do you hate men? Uh, no, I'm critical. That's, that's the difference

742
01:07:06,880 --> 01:07:12,720
being critical. Just because somebody has a difference of opinion or says something

743
01:07:12,720 --> 01:07:19,440
criticizing something else does not make them a hater. It makes them an intelligent human being

744
01:07:19,440 --> 01:07:24,720
that understands the difference between being a hater and being critical is someone who's taking

745
01:07:24,720 --> 01:07:29,600
and there's a difference also between like being a hater is just like, oh, well, I don't like Android.

746
01:07:29,600 --> 01:07:34,800
I don't know why I just don't because they're, they're not my iPhone. You know, people like that,

747
01:07:34,800 --> 01:07:42,640
that's hater. That's stupid. But when you're like, you know what, I have to say that I don't like

748
01:07:42,640 --> 01:07:47,360
this, this and this feature on this device. And I think it could be improved on and made better.

749
01:07:47,920 --> 01:07:57,600
You're not hating on it. You are being critical. Criticism and insulting or being just overtly

750
01:07:57,600 --> 01:08:04,080
negative are two different things. They can sometimes sound alike, especially if there is

751
01:08:04,080 --> 01:08:09,840
such a thing as being overly critical. Um, I prefer tactical, tactical criticism. And I know

752
01:08:09,840 --> 01:08:15,680
we have bordered a little bit sometimes cause we do feel so strongly about these things, but

753
01:08:16,640 --> 01:08:22,720
just because somebody has a difference of opinion than you and just because someone criticizes

754
01:08:22,720 --> 01:08:30,800
something does not give you the right to tell them not to. Everybody around us has the right

755
01:08:30,800 --> 01:08:38,960
to say whatever the goddamn fuck we want. End of story. That said, yes, there are consequences.

756
01:08:38,960 --> 01:08:43,520
If someone wants to go out and be a racist piece of shit, well, if they get ostracized for it,

757
01:08:43,520 --> 01:08:50,160
that's on them because they chose to say those words. But no one can tell another person what

758
01:08:50,160 --> 01:08:57,200
to say and what not to say. We can only create the social contract that outlines what is generally

759
01:08:57,200 --> 01:09:05,840
acceptable and what is not. If someone says, well, you can't say this about this group of people,

760
01:09:06,560 --> 01:09:12,080
what they're telling you is that it's not socially acceptable to say those things because

761
01:09:12,080 --> 01:09:19,360
they are hurtful. They will portray you as this or only people of this certain mindset would think

762
01:09:19,360 --> 01:09:26,000
something like this. Um, typically you, if you give someone correction, critical correction,

763
01:09:27,040 --> 01:09:31,440
then they'll be like, Oh, okay. If they're truly a good person, want to try to do better.

764
01:09:31,440 --> 01:09:36,960
And then there's those assholes who will take it as a personal insult, right? Right. It's all

765
01:09:37,680 --> 01:09:44,800
going back to criticism, going back to, uh, I'm a tactful isn't the quiet word that I'm looking

766
01:09:44,800 --> 01:09:49,920
for, although being tactful is certainly better, but it goes back to an understanding of the

767
01:09:49,920 --> 01:09:56,960
difference of knowing what's appropriate. Um, I have to get you a comment from Tiger

768
01:09:56,960 --> 01:10:02,160
Claw in chat that I think is, is really right on, honestly, Tiger Claw on chat says you find

769
01:10:02,160 --> 01:10:07,760
most haters on YouTube and they do it just because they can. And while I agree with Deft,

770
01:10:07,760 --> 01:10:11,440
I agree with Deft who follows it up and says, you can find haters everywhere, even IRL. While

771
01:10:11,440 --> 01:10:16,000
I do agree with that, there's something about YouTube and that culture that really

772
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:23,440
fosters that kind of hateful hater video and, uh, uh, culture and, and, and dark soccer,

773
01:10:23,440 --> 01:10:29,680
you just said it, it's all about the clicks and this goes back to why Facebook is bad

774
01:10:30,640 --> 01:10:37,680
because they exploit these things and the, the, the adrenaline rush that comes with hate,

775
01:10:38,400 --> 01:10:45,840
they exploit that for clicks. Why do you think it's always these shitty political debates and

776
01:10:45,840 --> 01:10:54,240
things that come up on Facebook? It's, it's all hate. And then yeah, these videos on YouTube

777
01:10:54,240 --> 01:10:59,360
are really bad, you know, and it's, it's in gaming, it's in everywhere you look, but like,

778
01:10:59,360 --> 01:11:04,560
you know, especially gaming, there's so many channels out there that are just hateful when

779
01:11:04,560 --> 01:11:10,000
it comes to games. And that's why, that's why, and I've said, folks, I've said this for years.

780
01:11:11,120 --> 01:11:15,680
If you're going to start a podcast, I always urge people, what's your theme? What's your brand?

781
01:11:15,680 --> 01:11:20,560
What is it? Describe your show in one sentence. What's the tagline on the movie poster? If your

782
01:11:20,560 --> 01:11:26,560
tagline is, oh, me and three of my friends, uh, sit around and talk shit about video games,

783
01:11:26,560 --> 01:11:32,960
do not do that podcast. Stop. Maybe, maybe podcasting isn't for you actually until you

784
01:11:32,960 --> 01:11:40,000
really reevaluate what it is you want to do, because I'm not going to download a fan podcast,

785
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:48,160
a fandom podcast, just hear someone talk shit all day. Yeah. And there are some podcasts and

786
01:11:48,400 --> 01:11:55,360
why, why not? There's some long running podcasts that I feel live in this world of we're just here

787
01:11:55,360 --> 01:12:02,320
to talk shit. It's old and it's pointless. Get a new hobby. No one wants to hear you

788
01:12:02,320 --> 01:12:07,600
bitch the whole time. People may want to hear you bitch for a little bit. And I like to think

789
01:12:07,600 --> 01:12:14,640
that we keep our bitching to an appropriate level of, of bitch-festing. If that's not a word it is

790
01:12:15,600 --> 01:12:21,920
now. Um, but I also like to think, and it could also, I mean, I don't want to do like,

791
01:12:21,920 --> 01:12:28,320
oh, the old mature gamer, get off my lawn, bullshit. But I think it also though does go

792
01:12:28,320 --> 01:12:36,960
that we are adults. We are well, well-rounded adults for the most part. You know what I mean?

793
01:12:37,760 --> 01:12:45,280
And we have experience in the communities that we're in and in our, this lifestyle that we're in

794
01:12:46,240 --> 01:12:52,720
that we've seen the ebb and flow, and we've seen what different attitudes can have. And we know

795
01:12:52,720 --> 01:13:01,520
that all we see is just cyclical, you know, we know politics are involved. We know it goes much

796
01:13:01,520 --> 01:13:08,240
further than just, oh, I like this game and I don't like this game. And I think that for us,

797
01:13:09,840 --> 01:13:17,120
because we know this, that's where we're better equipped to have these discussions and to know

798
01:13:17,120 --> 01:13:23,600
the right way to criticize. Well, and to be fair, I think we have to still be careful to elevate

799
01:13:23,600 --> 01:13:27,360
ourselves too much. There's a lot of podcasts that do get it right. That's why I was still

800
01:13:27,360 --> 01:13:36,240
saying stuff. But I think that, well, I mean, it pretty much is that just because we know

801
01:13:36,240 --> 01:13:41,920
these things doesn't make us any better than anybody else's opinion. It's just we can deliver

802
01:13:41,920 --> 01:13:50,160
it. And I think that some of our younger people, or I'm even going to say even older people,

803
01:13:50,160 --> 01:13:57,760
people who are susceptible to that sort of push that these social platforms have.

804
01:13:58,400 --> 01:14:04,240
And I honestly think that, yeah, there are a lot of people out there who are that gullible and

805
01:14:04,240 --> 01:14:09,920
will fall right into the trap because they are groomed to fall into that trap. And they let

806
01:14:09,920 --> 01:14:15,280
themselves be groomed to fall into that trap. Taking that step back from it is difficult.

807
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:22,400
And I think that just us as people, we have gotten to the point where we can take a step back from

808
01:14:23,040 --> 01:14:26,960
those environments, even though we have grown up with the advent of social media.

809
01:14:28,320 --> 01:14:33,600
I got something in my eye. No, you're fine. But I hope that made sense. It's not sort of like a

810
01:14:33,600 --> 01:14:38,480
self elevation sort of thing. It's more of an experience thing. It does. I get it. I get it.

811
01:14:38,480 --> 01:14:44,320
And not everyone is going to have that perfect storm of experiences. It's going to teach them,

812
01:14:44,320 --> 01:14:51,040
I need to disengage or I may be anonymous now, but some asshole is going to find me.

813
01:14:54,240 --> 01:14:58,800
So before we get to the next segment, I never got around to this. No, no, you're fine. I think this

814
01:14:58,800 --> 01:15:02,480
is actually a really good discussion. I think it's great. But I do need to mention at some point,

815
01:15:02,480 --> 01:15:09,120
the other big headline out of the VR meta stuff is that the new CEO of all this, Zuckerberg,

816
01:15:09,120 --> 01:15:15,040
announced that Grand Theft Auto San Andreas from the year 2004 will be getting a VR port for the

817
01:15:15,040 --> 01:15:20,880
Oculus Quest, or excuse me, the meta Quest 2. I got to get used to this now. In the event,

818
01:15:20,880 --> 01:15:24,880
Zuckerberg said, this new version of what I think is one of the greatest games ever made

819
01:15:24,880 --> 01:15:29,120
will offer players an entirely new way to experience this iconic open world in virtual

820
01:15:29,120 --> 01:15:34,320
reality. I'm really bummed out Loki's not here tonight to because, you know, you all know his

821
01:15:34,320 --> 01:15:38,560
feelings on all these ports. So I'm really bummed out. We can't ask him about this tonight, but,

822
01:15:38,560 --> 01:15:43,280
you know, we will next week at the top of the show when he's back. So I have nothing further

823
01:15:43,280 --> 01:15:47,680
to say on this for now. It's, you know, I'm very much of the mindset that, like, you shouldn't

824
01:15:47,680 --> 01:15:54,080
shove games in VR just because you can. But if they're making mindful, meaningful changes to it

825
01:15:54,080 --> 01:16:00,960
to make VR really enhance the game, then I guess I would keep an open mind. But I don't know. I

826
01:16:00,960 --> 01:16:07,840
feel like there's so many games I care more about in the immediate term than a port of Grand Theft

827
01:16:07,840 --> 01:16:13,600
Auto San Andreas. You guys are lighting up chat. Some of you talking about the Resident Evil 4.

828
01:16:14,400 --> 01:16:18,480
Questbuster says, I heard the Resident Evil 4 VR port is supposed to be really good. Well,

829
01:16:18,480 --> 01:16:22,960
you know, if they if they actually went back, retooled it, made it something for VR,

830
01:16:22,960 --> 01:16:28,320
then cool, that probably does really work. SSJ100Matt kind of going back to, you know,

831
01:16:28,320 --> 01:16:32,800
the other discussion Dark Soccer and I were having saying, parts of the internet have given

832
01:16:32,800 --> 01:16:37,760
every person a microphone. Give a billion people a megaphone, a large portion of those voices are

833
01:16:37,760 --> 01:16:42,480
going to be trash. Best way to drown it out is with being positive, not contribute to that

834
01:16:42,480 --> 01:16:47,920
nonsense and be part of an awesome community that is like minded and positive thinking, like VOG.

835
01:16:47,920 --> 01:16:51,200
Thank you very much for that. Yes. But I, you know, there's lots of great

836
01:16:51,200 --> 01:16:55,200
That warmed my cold heart. At least a degree. At least a degree. At least a degree.

837
01:16:56,640 --> 01:17:01,120
All right. I think enough enough about VR and all of these newfangled games.

838
01:17:01,680 --> 01:17:06,480
Let's go to an old favorite segment here in this next sequence here.

839
01:17:18,320 --> 01:17:23,840
And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull

840
01:17:23,840 --> 01:17:28,800
out a classic and tell you about it. It's time for the classic game of the week.

841
01:17:29,120 --> 01:17:33,200
All right, Dark Soccer, what did you pick tonight for the classic game of the week?

842
01:17:33,840 --> 01:17:37,360
I tried to pick something scary that I haven't done before. So I picked Galerians.

843
01:17:39,760 --> 01:17:42,160
I'm going to have to pay real quick just so you know, too. Sorry.

844
01:17:42,720 --> 01:17:49,840
I guess. Leave me by myself. I see how it is. Anyway, Galerians came out in 1999

845
01:17:49,840 --> 01:17:57,280
in Japan, August 26th, that is, in North America, March 29th, 2000, and in Europe, June 9th, 2000.

846
01:17:57,920 --> 01:18:05,840
It is a survival horror game that was developed by Polygon Magic for PlayStation. You play as a

847
01:18:05,840 --> 01:18:15,440
boy named Rion who discovers he has psychic powers. He also has amnesia. And as he learns who he is,

848
01:18:15,440 --> 01:18:20,640
he learns that he is to survive against. He's going to help everyone survive against the

849
01:18:20,640 --> 01:18:25,680
Galerians, which are these genetically enhanced humans. And there is a sequel, by the way.

850
01:18:25,680 --> 01:18:32,480
Galerians Ash came out on PS2 a little while later. And it is one of the earliest survival

851
01:18:32,480 --> 01:18:40,160
horror games. It was kind of compared to Resident Evil at the time. It has the whole tank control

852
01:18:40,160 --> 01:18:49,280
thing where, you know, you hold up or down to move around, you know, but you have to readjust

853
01:18:49,280 --> 01:18:56,240
your camera, you know, as you're going along. You also, it is a 3D game, had pre-rendered

854
01:18:56,240 --> 01:19:01,920
backgrounds. And as you go through the games, you find items and clues and you use that to unlock

855
01:19:01,920 --> 01:19:10,000
new areas and keep going around. But Galerians doesn't have any gun-based combat. It uses psychic

856
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:20,240
powers. So Rion has different powers. He has a telepathic sense to gain clues and do puzzles.

857
01:19:21,760 --> 01:19:29,680
His offensive powers he get by taking drugs. Or as in the English version, PPEC,

858
01:19:29,680 --> 01:19:37,040
psychic power enhancement chemicals, he's taking drugs. So each one of those vials

859
01:19:40,240 --> 01:19:47,760
that you get is finite. So you have to conserve them. They have one to two second charge time.

860
01:19:48,560 --> 01:19:52,480
And so you have to find the right interval to attack. Timing is everything.

861
01:19:55,920 --> 01:20:01,840
So if you defeat an enemy with that, then they won't leave any items and you don't get

862
01:20:01,840 --> 01:20:10,320
experience. So you're trying to avoid combat when you can. There are three gauges for status. One's

863
01:20:10,320 --> 01:20:18,000
a health meter for damage. The other one is AP absorption points, which adds up as Rion takes

864
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:24,000
damage, uses his ability or under stress, kind of like a limit break. And it depletes as he uses

865
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:31,280
his powers. When the meter is full, he loses control of his powers and has a continuous

866
01:20:31,280 --> 01:20:35,520
psychic assault power that will basically kill everybody except a boss in a single blow.

867
01:20:37,040 --> 01:20:46,800
And it can be fatal to Rion if it goes unchecked. So anyway, it was a fairly interesting game.

868
01:20:46,800 --> 01:20:55,280
It had a fairly interesting story. It also has to do with themes of AIs and things of,

869
01:20:55,920 --> 01:20:59,840
you know, have you surpassed your creator and different things like that.

870
01:21:00,560 --> 01:21:07,520
It was quite the interesting theme. And it was a very interesting spin for its time. It got fairly

871
01:21:08,800 --> 01:21:16,000
decent, kind of middle of the road to good ratings. And then it actually had some others

872
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:23,200
that came apart from it. So there were two light novels that were written by Takiguchi Maki, came

873
01:21:23,200 --> 01:21:31,200
out in 2000 and just talked about the details of the game. It was a CGI three-part OAV that came

874
01:21:31,200 --> 01:21:38,160
out in 2002 called Galerians Rion. And it basically, again, follows the story. There's also

875
01:21:38,160 --> 01:21:46,160
an art book called Galerians A-Head, as in A-H-E-A-D, not as a head, but A-head, that had preliminary

876
01:21:46,160 --> 01:21:52,960
sketches, character stuff, box art, storyboards, general artwork from the games and the OVAs. It

877
01:21:53,760 --> 01:22:04,480
was illustrated by Tajime Sho. So there you go. We only ever got the two games. By the way, the

878
01:22:05,680 --> 01:22:11,360
distribution in Japan was by ASCII Entertainment and everywhere else in the world by Crave

879
01:22:11,360 --> 01:22:17,920
Entertainment. And there you go. I'm unfamiliar with this game. It somehow was like never on my

880
01:22:17,920 --> 01:22:23,040
radar, honestly. It was, I had friends who were really into it and then I had friends who were

881
01:22:23,040 --> 01:22:30,640
like, what? So, yeah. All right. Yeah, it's a neat little game. Galerians Ash was really good.

882
01:22:32,160 --> 01:22:37,600
All right. There you go. Well, there it is, your classic game of the week, a little bit spooky-ish.

883
01:22:37,600 --> 01:22:43,040
Galerian is your classic game of the week. So, all right. I'll have to check that one out. Again,

884
01:22:43,040 --> 01:22:46,800
it's not one I'm super familiar with, to be honest. So just never got around to that one.

885
01:22:47,360 --> 01:22:52,400
Yeah. I just don't, I don't like the tank control type stuff. So I didn't play too far into it,

886
01:22:52,400 --> 01:22:58,080
but when I played, I liked it. It was really fun exploding people's heads. All right. Kind of like

887
01:22:58,080 --> 01:23:02,960
scanners. So we just have a little bit more for you before we get to the listener round table.

888
01:23:02,960 --> 01:23:06,640
I did say at the top of the show, it's probably going to be a shorter show tonight. So if you do

889
01:23:06,640 --> 01:23:10,000
want to call in or something, you can make your way over to Discord in our green room over at

890
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:14,400
vognetwork.com slash Discord. Even if you don't want to call in, I encourage you to join our

891
01:23:14,400 --> 01:23:19,840
Discord. It doesn't everyone have a Discord now, but we have a community there where you can kind

892
01:23:19,840 --> 01:23:24,400
of post stories throughout the week. We pull a lot of stories there for our show and talk to us.

893
01:23:24,400 --> 01:23:27,840
And there's all sorts of different topics and fun things that go on Discord. So again, that's

894
01:23:27,840 --> 01:23:33,040
vognetwork.com slash Discord. But before we do that, let's travel around the world and check out

895
01:23:33,040 --> 01:23:37,840
some release dates. With Loki not here tonight, I'm going to try my best to take on the US dates

896
01:23:37,840 --> 01:23:42,160
here tonight. So coming out this week on November, and here we go, we're getting into November. So

897
01:23:42,160 --> 01:23:48,160
we got a lot of releases now. On the Nintendo Switch this week, on the second, we have Cupid

898
01:23:48,160 --> 01:23:53,680
Parasite and World War Z. We also have Knockout City making its way to PlayStation 5 and the

899
01:23:53,680 --> 01:23:57,040
Series X. I think that game was already out, because I know I've had friends that are trying

900
01:23:57,040 --> 01:24:01,680
to get me to play it. But it's now coming out for the more, I guess, next gen or current gen,

901
01:24:01,680 --> 01:24:06,800
depending on where your head is at, systems. On the fourth, I remember we talked about this before,

902
01:24:06,800 --> 01:24:11,520
but A Boy and His Blob making its way to the Nintendo Switch. I believe this is a port of

903
01:24:11,520 --> 01:24:17,680
that Wii version, which is a Wii-make, get it, of the original NES game, which was kind of an

904
01:24:18,240 --> 01:24:23,280
underground kind of indie cultish kind of hit that never, no, it did get a sequel on the Game Boy,

905
01:24:23,280 --> 01:24:29,600
I think, actually, if I remember right. So it's a very different kind of game. Just Dance 2022 is

906
01:24:29,600 --> 01:24:35,360
out on everything, because those games always come out on everything. I think finally, though,

907
01:24:35,360 --> 01:24:40,000
they have stopped making them for the Wii, and all systems older than that. But that is out this

908
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:47,280
week, so you can get the latest and greatest Just Dance game. Tales of Luminaria. This is the Tales

909
01:24:47,280 --> 01:24:53,280
game for mobile. That is also out on the fourth. And a game called Where Cards Fall, a puzzle game

910
01:24:53,280 --> 01:25:00,000
out for PC and Nintendo Switch. And then on the fifth, we have Call of Duty Vanguard is going to

911
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:05,120
be coming out on a variety of different systems and because it's a Call of Duty game. And then

912
01:25:05,120 --> 01:25:12,160
the Kid A Amnesia exhibition, remember that random radio head thing? Apparently that is out

913
01:25:12,800 --> 01:25:18,320
this week for Windows, Mac, and PS5 on the fifth of November. So that will be-

914
01:25:18,320 --> 01:25:19,360
Remember, remember.

915
01:25:19,360 --> 01:25:19,860
That's right.

916
01:25:20,640 --> 01:25:22,400
Also, that's my mom's birthday.

917
01:25:22,400 --> 01:25:23,440
Is it really?

918
01:25:23,440 --> 01:25:23,940
Yeah, it is.

919
01:25:24,800 --> 01:25:29,680
In the not too distant future, Forza Horizon 5 coming out on the ninth. But I think there

920
01:25:29,920 --> 01:25:35,280
is an early access thing if you pay the extra money to get into the early access. I did not,

921
01:25:35,280 --> 01:25:38,960
so I'll wait for the ninth. But I know Bobby said he always gives a lot of money for Forza

922
01:25:38,960 --> 01:25:43,760
Horizon because it's his favorite series. So I think he gets in earlier in the week. But the

923
01:25:43,760 --> 01:25:49,280
official release of that game is actually in next week's releases on November the ninth. Why don't

924
01:25:49,280 --> 01:25:53,600
we hop over to the UK if we could while I get Japan's dates up, Dark Sakura?

925
01:25:54,400 --> 01:25:58,240
Sure. And I will need an AFK after that.

926
01:25:58,240 --> 01:25:58,740
That's fine.

927
01:25:59,460 --> 01:26:06,020
So we have on November 2nd, we have World War Z Aftermath on Switch.

928
01:26:07,140 --> 01:26:12,580
Further on the second, we have Astria Ascending for Switch and PlayStation,

929
01:26:13,140 --> 01:26:20,260
Hell Let Loose on PlayStation and Xbox, Fortnite Minty Legends Pack on the three, the big three.

930
01:26:20,260 --> 01:26:27,860
On the fourth, we have Just Dance 2022 on the big three, Call of Duty Vanguard on the fifth,

931
01:26:29,620 --> 01:26:37,940
also the Nintendo Switch Lite Pokemon, Diaga and Palkia. We have Fast and Furious Spy Racers,

932
01:26:37,940 --> 01:26:43,460
Rise of Shifter also on the fifth. And that looks like what it is.

933
01:26:46,020 --> 01:26:46,520
All right.

934
01:26:49,300 --> 01:26:53,940
Yes, that's fine. Let me go to the Japanese releases while Dark Sakura takes a break there.

935
01:26:53,940 --> 01:27:00,100
So let's start on the Switch for Japan. We have Danganronpa Decadence is out this week.

936
01:27:00,100 --> 01:27:04,740
So I know there's lots of people that are really hardcore into Danganronpa. I don't believe this

937
01:27:04,740 --> 01:27:10,020
is a new game. I think it is a repackaging of the big three Danganronpa games, but it also has

938
01:27:10,020 --> 01:27:16,020
Danganronpa S Ultimate Summer Camp, which is like an expanded version of the bonus content from

939
01:27:16,020 --> 01:27:21,060
Danganronpa V3. So it sounds like it's really like a definitive Danganronpa collection that's

940
01:27:21,060 --> 01:27:26,420
out in Japan this week for the Switch. Model debut to Nicola. I have no idea what that is,

941
01:27:26,420 --> 01:27:30,980
but that is also out this week on the fourth. Of course, Just Dance 2022 also making its way

942
01:27:30,980 --> 01:27:42,580
to Japan this week. And there's also the Pokemon Diaga and Palkia Nintendo Switches are out this

943
01:27:42,580 --> 01:27:47,220
week in Japan. So that is also something to look forward to. And I think those are making their

944
01:27:47,220 --> 01:27:51,620
way over here too. Just didn't show up in our release dates here, but that is all happening

945
01:27:51,620 --> 01:27:58,820
November 5th because the redo of Diamond and Pearl are not that far away. So of course,

946
01:27:58,820 --> 01:28:05,620
they want to get that special Switch out for those. Heading over to the PlayStation 5,

947
01:28:05,620 --> 01:28:10,260
there's something called the Fortnite Minty Legends pack, and it is coming out in Japan.

948
01:28:10,260 --> 01:28:13,380
I think there's versions of that that are also coming out in other territories,

949
01:28:13,380 --> 01:28:18,500
but Japan can't escape the Fortnite stuff either. I'm sure it's probably not as big a deal there,

950
01:28:18,500 --> 01:28:22,420
but they are releasing that. And then the other big release in the PlayStation 5 this week,

951
01:28:22,420 --> 01:28:29,860
of course, Call of Duty Vanguard also releasing in Japan. All right, I'm going to the chat over

952
01:28:29,860 --> 01:28:35,540
at twitch.tv slash vog network. S2100 Matt says, how many versions of the Pokemon game is Shane

953
01:28:35,540 --> 01:28:42,260
buying is the real question? I'm guessing four. Last I checked with Shane, and if he's out there,

954
01:28:42,260 --> 01:28:49,540
he can speak for himself, but the remakes are not landing for him the same way the Arceus Legends

955
01:28:49,540 --> 01:28:55,300
stuff is. So that is, I think, what he's really looking forward to. I don't think he planned.

956
01:28:55,300 --> 01:29:01,060
I think he'll buy probably at least one, but I don't think you're going to see him buy like

957
01:29:01,060 --> 01:29:05,860
eight copies. I think he's passed that for these remakes. So and I don't know if he was getting

958
01:29:05,860 --> 01:29:13,060
the actual Pokemon switches, so we'll have him back on the show to ask. I have M&Ms. Lucky. All

959
01:29:13,060 --> 01:29:20,100
right, let's move on. Don't eat on air. Meet yourself. All right, let's go to I needed chocolate.

960
01:29:21,460 --> 01:29:27,380
Let's go to one more story here, and then we'll get to some emails and maybe some calls. And this

961
01:29:27,380 --> 01:29:36,180
story has to do with, get this, another Super Smash Brothers kind of clone is on its way. And

962
01:29:36,180 --> 01:29:42,660
this is coming from Warner Brothers, apparently, is going to be putting this one out. And it's

963
01:29:42,660 --> 01:29:48,340
coming from basically a leak that's online. It looks like it's a free-to-play title, and they

964
01:29:48,340 --> 01:29:55,140
are saying it kind of looks cheap with this. And with this game, some characters have already been

965
01:29:55,140 --> 01:29:59,940
spotted. There's a screenshot out there which really kind of lends credit to this is probably

966
01:29:59,940 --> 01:30:06,820
true. Like Rick on there. Yeah, Rick from Rick and Morty, Tom from Tom and Jerry, Bugs Bunny's there,

967
01:30:06,820 --> 01:30:12,020
Superman. Where are the Warner Brothers and the Warner Sister dot? Well, this is only one

968
01:30:12,020 --> 01:30:16,420
screenshot. So the Warner Brothers and the Warner Sister dot could be on their way. It could be DLC,

969
01:30:16,420 --> 01:30:20,500
but it's just it's interesting to see this, especially right after this Nickelodeon thing

970
01:30:20,500 --> 01:30:25,060
had just come out. And it's kind of making the waves that it's making is that now we have the

971
01:30:25,060 --> 01:30:30,740
this other one coming. Now, while we are in chat says you get what you pay for. Possibly. It sounds

972
01:30:30,740 --> 01:30:36,180
like that could be the case with this as it is free to play. But it is still rumor. It's

973
01:30:36,180 --> 01:30:43,620
unconfirmed. But the screenshot is is pretty. I mean, it does not look like a bunch of copy

974
01:30:43,620 --> 01:30:48,980
pasted images together because it looks like these characters have all been rendered in a similar way

975
01:30:48,980 --> 01:30:53,700
for this game. And I think that's what makes it very compelling evidence. I guess it could be a

976
01:30:53,700 --> 01:30:57,700
fan thing at the end of the day, but it's looking it's looking like there's a little smoke here and

977
01:30:57,700 --> 01:31:04,820
there's probably fire. So we'll see when this possibly comes to fruition with that. Let's get

978
01:31:04,820 --> 01:31:09,700
to you guys and your feedback. We can do some comments. We don't as well know. Of course,

979
01:31:09,700 --> 01:31:14,260
we have to. We have to get to the emails. Participate at Orange Lounge. Radio dot com is

980
01:31:14,260 --> 01:31:18,660
the place to send your emails every week. Of course, you can also join our green room over

981
01:31:18,660 --> 01:31:23,060
at Vogue Network dot com slash discord. I know there's about half the audience here tonight.

982
01:31:23,060 --> 01:31:27,780
There usually is just between Halloween and World Series and all this other stuff. There's just a

983
01:31:27,780 --> 01:31:32,260
lot going on today. Probably be a lot of podcast folks. You can email us anytime. Of course,

984
01:31:32,260 --> 01:31:36,020
participate at Orange Lounge Radio dot com. Let's get to email Stark Sakura.

985
01:31:37,460 --> 01:31:41,060
OK, so first email is back from the 22nd.

986
01:31:41,140 --> 01:31:50,180
A new entry would be preferable, of course, but has Rockstar released a 2D trilogy,

987
01:31:50,180 --> 01:31:56,260
remaster of Grand Theft Auto, GTA London and GTA 2? And that's from Robert M. I don't know.

988
01:31:56,260 --> 01:32:01,780
I don't think so. I think it's been a while. They did release, re-release them at one point.

989
01:32:02,500 --> 01:32:06,820
And I think it might have been like a preorder bonus or something for one of them newer GTA

990
01:32:06,820 --> 01:32:16,660
games. But I don't think we visited those games in a while. There was also the 3DS question mark

991
01:32:16,660 --> 01:32:21,620
Grand Theft Auto game that was more inspired by the it was Chinatown Wars was the name of it.

992
01:32:21,620 --> 01:32:26,260
And it was more inspired by the classic Grand Theft Auto games. But it wasn't really a remake

993
01:32:26,260 --> 01:32:36,500
either. So. All right. All right. So we have one more email. It's from YYR, so it's a long one.

994
01:32:37,540 --> 01:32:41,940
Hello, LR. Once again, I was catching up on slightly older episodes and felt the need

995
01:32:41,940 --> 01:32:45,060
to chime in. Thanks for giving me an extra week to catch up. He he.

996
01:32:45,780 --> 01:32:51,060
During the action packed three hour episode from October 10th, it was mentioned that direct credit

997
01:32:51,060 --> 01:32:55,620
card payments will no longer be allowed for digital purposes on PS3 and Vita. It was speculated

998
01:32:55,620 --> 01:33:02,580
that this might just might be the beginning of the actual end for those stores. Well, as someone

999
01:33:02,580 --> 01:33:07,780
who just purchased a bunch of stuff on Vita this month, I can tell you that it's already barely

1000
01:33:07,780 --> 01:33:14,660
working in order to download any of my Vita purchases or transfer them to Vita from PS3.

1001
01:33:14,660 --> 01:33:20,500
I had to mash the download button many times before it would work. Most of those times it

1002
01:33:20,500 --> 01:33:27,380
would error out with a nonsense error messaging code. There were posts about this all over the

1003
01:33:27,380 --> 01:33:32,100
Internet, but I doubt they'll fix it because why would they? I'm probably the only one who still

1004
01:33:33,220 --> 01:33:37,700
buying Vita games anyway. I don't think you're alone, but it's not a lot of people.

1005
01:33:39,060 --> 01:33:44,260
I will mention that Microsoft is not entirely off the hook for things like this. Just try performing

1006
01:33:44,260 --> 01:33:50,660
a license transfer on your Xbox 360. In the likely event that you get an error, you're basically

1007
01:33:50,660 --> 01:33:57,780
screwed. Enjoy reading all of the posts from other frustrated users trying to get answers from MS

1008
01:33:57,780 --> 01:34:03,940
as to why it's busted and when or if it will work again. So the new achievement system for

1009
01:34:03,940 --> 01:34:08,340
the Epic Games Store was mentioned. Let me tell you, this is the most half-assed broken

1010
01:34:08,340 --> 01:34:15,860
garbage achievement system I've ever seen because we've seen many times over the last 15 years that

1011
01:34:15,860 --> 01:34:20,500
a game will come out with achievements and trophies and then it will get DLC and then

1012
01:34:20,500 --> 01:34:24,900
more achievements or trophies are added. Well, guess what? On Epic Store, this is not possible

1013
01:34:24,900 --> 01:34:30,020
at all. Their new achievement system comes with three mandates. All achievements will be

1014
01:34:30,020 --> 01:34:34,820
associated with a point value. The number of points must sum up to a total of 1,000. No more,

1015
01:34:34,820 --> 01:34:40,900
no less. Once the achievements go live, they cannot be altered in any way. So next year,

1016
01:34:40,900 --> 01:34:45,380
I'm going to be releasing my expansion for Super Multitasking. I'm going to be changing some

1017
01:34:45,380 --> 01:34:50,900
existing achievements to make them more easily obtainable and I'm going to be adding new ones.

1018
01:34:50,900 --> 01:34:56,020
If I was on the Epic Games Store, this would not be possible. I bet you're going to see a number

1019
01:34:56,020 --> 01:35:00,740
of developers choose not to bother rather than risk being locked into something forever. It's

1020
01:35:00,740 --> 01:35:06,340
stupid. It sucks and I hate it. On the plus side, my ears perked up when you mentioned Konami's

1021
01:35:06,340 --> 01:35:11,380
contest for indie developers to revive some of their dormant franchises. On the minus side,

1022
01:35:11,380 --> 01:35:16,100
I'm disqualified. In order to be eligible, you must live in Japan. So I apologize, but you won't

1023
01:35:16,100 --> 01:35:20,900
be seeing a new version of Gyruss for me anytime soon. You know what else you won't be seeing from

1024
01:35:20,900 --> 01:35:26,580
me? A Pixel Poops E-Football crossover. Don't worry, you're better off. The collision detection

1025
01:35:26,580 --> 01:35:31,300
would have been broken and the jogger's AI would have been busted too. Have you ever seen a jogger

1026
01:35:31,300 --> 01:35:36,020
that forgot how to jog? Be glad that you never will. Anyway, thanks for the show and have a

1027
01:35:36,020 --> 01:35:43,460
fantastic week. Hugs, Aaron YYR. Great email, YYR. Yeah, I guess we overlooked a pretty,

1028
01:35:43,460 --> 01:35:48,740
pretty obvious point there in the contest that, yeah, in order to win a Japanese contest,

1029
01:35:48,740 --> 01:35:53,060
you probably have to be from Japan. Obviously, I never expected you were really going to enter

1030
01:35:53,060 --> 01:35:58,420
in anyway, but it's fun to imagine, isn't it? Very interesting on the Epic achievement fronts. I had

1031
01:35:58,420 --> 01:36:03,460
no idea it was that like ridiculous, especially when they're catching up. You know, in a related

1032
01:36:03,460 --> 01:36:08,020
ish kind of story, there was some rumors and I didn't put them in the show world, but I guess

1033
01:36:08,020 --> 01:36:13,060
we'll bring it up here. Nintendo may actually be finally looking at doing achievements.

1034
01:36:13,140 --> 01:36:17,140
And this is from some stuff that I think I, it was data mined somewhere, I think in the latest

1035
01:36:17,140 --> 01:36:22,420
firmware update and a heavy rumor that Splatoon 3 may be the first game with them. And that,

1036
01:36:22,420 --> 01:36:26,420
I guess it ties in maybe the way Nintendo has been doing mobile achievements, but I haven't been

1037
01:36:26,420 --> 01:36:30,580
really paying attention to a lot of Nintendo mobile titles. So I haven't really seen how

1038
01:36:30,580 --> 01:36:35,780
this works, but it's interesting. Nintendo's looking at it too. And I hope it's not as crappy

1039
01:36:35,780 --> 01:36:43,060
as what Epic is doing, which really sounds copy pasted from the Xbox 360.

1040
01:36:45,140 --> 01:36:51,460
But the Xbox 360 was before so many people were doing DLC. You know, like I remember 360,

1041
01:36:51,460 --> 01:36:56,020
everything was capped at a thousand, everything had to add up to a thousand, but there were some

1042
01:36:56,020 --> 01:37:00,180
exceptions. Like I think all the DLC for Oblivion got to add some extra achievements and stuff, but

1043
01:37:00,900 --> 01:37:06,260
like, I just, yeah, it's, I feel like that was not the thing to copy.

1044
01:37:07,860 --> 01:37:11,860
It'll be interesting to see how that plays out. I wonder if PlayStation 3, oh, you know,

1045
01:37:11,860 --> 01:37:17,780
PlayStation 3 trophies could be updated because I remember DLC would add like a little plus sign

1046
01:37:17,780 --> 01:37:20,740
and it would almost treat it like a different game. But yeah, it just seems like something's

1047
01:37:20,740 --> 01:37:26,260
a little bit backwards and old with what is happening. I don't know. YYR in chat says,

1048
01:37:26,260 --> 01:37:30,820
maybe Splatoon 3 has its own achievement system that just works within the game itself.

1049
01:37:30,820 --> 01:37:34,340
I think some Switch games do that. Oh, certainly that could be there,

1050
01:37:34,340 --> 01:37:40,820
but keep in mind, Splatoon 3 is nowhere near being out. People are peeking under the hood

1051
01:37:40,820 --> 01:37:45,700
at the firmware and seeing indications of it there. And so that's why it seems to be something

1052
01:37:45,700 --> 01:37:50,980
that's not constrained just to the game. Animal Crossing they're saying is also kind of rumored

1053
01:37:50,980 --> 01:37:54,500
for this, which is weird because most people have already kind of come and gone from Animal Crossing,

1054
01:37:55,380 --> 01:37:58,900
but not to say they couldn't retroactively add things. It could be interesting.

1055
01:37:58,900 --> 01:38:02,100
I think achievements for the classic NES games would be something,

1056
01:38:02,100 --> 01:38:06,340
but I don't ever see Nintendo putting the effort into it. So we'll see.

1057
01:38:06,340 --> 01:38:08,420
Congratulations. You cheated at Contra.

1058
01:38:08,420 --> 01:38:12,580
Yeah. I like that. All right. Any more emails?

1059
01:38:14,580 --> 01:38:15,140
No.

1060
01:38:15,140 --> 01:38:19,460
Okay. Participate at Orangelaunchradio.com if you want to send us a future email.

1061
01:38:19,860 --> 01:38:24,020
Um, we're about to wrap up, but we usually do last minute stories here.

1062
01:38:24,020 --> 01:38:28,980
Loki's not here to do any last minute stories, but the chat room jumping in here with a last

1063
01:38:28,980 --> 01:38:34,020
minute story. This one's, um, could be a big one. As Joe and Hunter Matt linked us to this one,

1064
01:38:34,020 --> 01:38:39,620
the headline, and this is from Sega's websites and from their Japanese website, sega.co.jp.

1065
01:38:40,740 --> 01:38:48,420
Sega and Microsoft to explore a strategic alliance to create new strategic titles for Sega

1066
01:38:48,420 --> 01:38:51,300
and established a next generation development environment.

1067
01:38:52,100 --> 01:38:53,300
So strategic.

1068
01:38:53,300 --> 01:38:59,220
Now that's now for all the hubaloo where people were saying Microsoft needs to buy Sega.

1069
01:39:00,180 --> 01:39:05,860
It doesn't seem like that's happening, but this is very interesting. Let's move on.

1070
01:39:05,860 --> 01:39:08,820
I guess I can read this word for word because it's an official press release.

1071
01:39:09,620 --> 01:39:13,860
Sega and Microsoft have agreed in principle, a strategic alliance that explores ways for

1072
01:39:13,860 --> 01:39:18,020
Sega to produce large scale global games in a next generation development environment

1073
01:39:18,020 --> 01:39:22,660
built on Microsoft's Azure cloud platform. This alliance would form a key part of Sega's

1074
01:39:22,660 --> 01:39:26,980
mid to longterm strategy, allowing the business to move forward with super game,

1075
01:39:26,980 --> 01:39:31,700
a new initiative for developing new and innovative titles where the key focuses are global online

1076
01:39:31,700 --> 01:39:36,740
community and IP utilization. With the world now more connected than ever following the

1077
01:39:36,740 --> 01:39:41,780
widespread deployment of 5g and cloud services in recent years, consumers can more easily enjoy

1078
01:39:41,780 --> 01:39:45,940
high quality entertainment content at any time within this high connected environment,

1079
01:39:45,940 --> 01:39:49,620
the ecosystem surrounding the games industry continues to evolve and expand as more

1080
01:39:49,620 --> 01:39:53,860
sophisticated tools and technology become available. As such, video games continue to

1081
01:39:53,860 --> 01:39:58,260
grow as a major medium for gamers globally with access to a vast range of gaming experiences and

1082
01:39:58,260 --> 01:40:02,980
communities becoming more diverse and attainable. Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Here we go.

1083
01:40:02,980 --> 01:40:07,780
The proposed alliance represents Sega looking ahead and by working with Microsoft to anticipate

1084
01:40:07,780 --> 01:40:13,460
such trends as they accelerate further in future, the global is to optimize development processes

1085
01:40:13,460 --> 01:40:18,500
and continue to bring high quality experiences to players using Azure cloud technologies.

1086
01:40:19,060 --> 01:40:24,340
Microsoft and Sega have agreed upon the foundation for this alliance and through mutual cooperation

1087
01:40:24,340 --> 01:40:29,140
will look to build further technological evolutions with areas such as the network

1088
01:40:29,140 --> 01:40:35,140
infrastructure and communication tools required for global online services being a key priority.

1089
01:40:35,140 --> 01:40:38,820
Additionally, by shifting to a next generation development platform,

1090
01:40:38,820 --> 01:40:44,100
Sega can effectively adapt to diversifying work styles and potential infrastructural changes.

1091
01:40:45,860 --> 01:40:51,780
Interesting. Because nowhere in that do I see the word Xbox.

1092
01:40:53,780 --> 01:40:58,020
So, it doesn't seem like, and I think there will be people that read into this that say,

1093
01:40:58,020 --> 01:41:05,620
oh, Sega's going to do exclusive Xbox games. That might be a conclusion jumping to, but when I hear

1094
01:41:05,620 --> 01:41:11,780
the Azure cloud stuff too, that could really just be, you know, Sega, it really sounds like

1095
01:41:11,780 --> 01:41:17,620
Phantasy Star Online 2 has done pretty well and they're probably, because, you know, you talk

1096
01:41:17,620 --> 01:41:21,460
about the online experience, it sounds like Sega may be developing something else in the online

1097
01:41:21,460 --> 01:41:26,740
space. They're going to use Microsoft's technology to help them out. I just wish we would get like

1098
01:41:26,740 --> 01:41:35,140
another dedicated console again. Right. YYRS says what do these Azure powered games even look like?

1099
01:41:35,140 --> 01:41:40,500
Stuff like Flight Simulator maybe? Maybe. That's actually not a bad call because I think Flight

1100
01:41:40,500 --> 01:41:45,300
Simulator is powered in part by the cloud and how they get a lot of that real time weather and all

1101
01:41:45,300 --> 01:41:52,180
of that information. So, maybe Sega's looking at doing something, you know, of that sort of scope

1102
01:41:52,180 --> 01:41:56,820
and it's probably something we don't know of. Of course, it's something we don't know of, but I

1103
01:41:56,820 --> 01:42:01,140
mean like maybe not an existing franchise. So, I don't think I would read into this. It means,

1104
01:42:01,220 --> 01:42:05,620
oh, it means Yakuza or it means Sonic or anything like that or Phantasy Star even.

1105
01:42:06,660 --> 01:42:11,860
It could be something new that Sega's up to. I don't know. S.G.O. 100 Matt says so I'm reading

1106
01:42:11,860 --> 01:42:16,740
this as Microsoft is giving them dev tools for free in exchange for something. Whatever that

1107
01:42:16,740 --> 01:42:20,980
something is, we'll see in a few years. It's very possible Microsoft is going to be given an

1108
01:42:20,980 --> 01:42:27,780
exclusive window for Sega's next big game and that could be a huge deal because when I see Azure

1109
01:42:27,780 --> 01:42:34,420
Cloud, it ain't going to be for Nintendo. So, the switch is out. So, that means that Sega, you know,

1110
01:42:34,420 --> 01:42:40,100
and obviously Microsoft's Achilles heel is Japan and the Japanese market. We've known this for a

1111
01:42:40,100 --> 01:42:45,220
long time. They need an alliance like this. I don't think this is alliance as much as some

1112
01:42:45,220 --> 01:42:51,620
people may think it is, but it's a start. So, it'll be very interesting. We'll see what develops

1113
01:42:51,620 --> 01:42:59,460
from this. Thank you for the share. Definitely very interesting. It is. It is. All right. What's

1114
01:42:59,460 --> 01:43:07,540
this thing about an epic store? What, the other link that was in chat there? Yeah.

1115
01:43:08,820 --> 01:43:15,780
Oh, it's a new character for Fortnite or a character set for Fortnite. I heard Fortnite's

1116
01:43:15,780 --> 01:43:19,940
going to close in China. That was another headline I had scrolled by earlier. I guess something about

1117
01:43:19,940 --> 01:43:23,540
some, you know, all the crackdowns that's happening with gaming there is going to affect Fortnite in

1118
01:43:23,540 --> 01:43:32,820
China. It's interesting. There's actually another one just for the ones who do the Roblox thing.

1119
01:43:32,820 --> 01:43:37,380
Apparently, they were out for three days and now Roblox is back up. Yeah. Roblox. I figure there's

1120
01:43:37,380 --> 01:43:41,620
not a lot of our audience that plays that, but yeah, they were down for a little while.

1121
01:43:42,260 --> 01:43:46,420
Well, now there's like some horror games also available on Xbox Game Pass right now.

1122
01:43:46,900 --> 01:43:50,500
Yeah, I think there's some of the websites are just highlighting games. I don't think there's

1123
01:43:50,500 --> 01:43:56,260
anything new. I think that's for blood is on there. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's kind of cool.

1124
01:43:56,260 --> 01:44:02,660
Quest Buster, I think with a really interesting perspective on the Microsoft Sega thing. Imagine

1125
01:44:02,660 --> 01:44:08,340
leveraging that technology for their subsidiary studios, like for Creative Assembly and its Total

1126
01:44:08,340 --> 01:44:14,660
War series. Very interesting thought. Tiger Claw says, who knows what this alliance will lead to?

1127
01:44:15,540 --> 01:44:23,380
Microsoft buys Sega. I think that's very premature. In fact, I think a headline like this

1128
01:44:24,420 --> 01:44:31,620
actually pulls away from that because I think a headline like this shows no, Microsoft's not

1129
01:44:31,620 --> 01:44:35,460
buying Sega, but they are going to have a partnership. I think that's a very different

1130
01:44:35,460 --> 01:44:40,660
thing. So I actually, Tiger Claw, I completely see how you jump to that conclusion. And I bet

1131
01:44:40,660 --> 01:44:45,780
many YouTubes and many tweets and many podcasts you listen to are going to jump to that conclusion.

1132
01:44:45,780 --> 01:44:53,140
But I think this actually distances it from an actual purchase. I think we get the agreement

1133
01:44:53,140 --> 01:44:59,860
and that's what it is and not an actual purchase or anything. And I think that it would be

1134
01:45:00,420 --> 01:45:09,620
financially unwise for Microsoft to acquire Sega in that manner, because I think Sega on its own

1135
01:45:10,900 --> 01:45:16,420
would be more profitable as a partner than as a subsidiary.

1136
01:45:18,660 --> 01:45:22,340
Deft in chat on the Fortnite thing is bringing some perspective to the new character. It's not

1137
01:45:22,340 --> 01:45:28,900
just any character. It is a Mexican TV character that is turning 51 years old. El Chapulin,

1138
01:45:28,900 --> 01:45:36,260
Colorado is coming to Fortnite. And of course, Deft being our official ambassador to the country

1139
01:45:36,260 --> 01:45:41,380
of Mexico here at OLR. And I mean that because I always appreciate hearing his perspective from

1140
01:45:41,380 --> 01:45:47,380
in Mexico. Obviously, that's a pretty cool deal to see some of that representation in the game.

1141
01:45:47,380 --> 01:45:53,780
That's pretty cool. That's really cool. Yeah. All right. The Crimson Grasshopper. I think that's

1142
01:45:53,780 --> 01:45:57,140
going to do it for another episode of Orange Launch Radio. Thank you so much for tuning into

1143
01:45:57,140 --> 01:46:00,340
our show, especially when we were gone last week. And I know it's been a shorter show tonight,

1144
01:46:00,340 --> 01:46:04,660
but you guys know it's just the way it played out. But we'll be back next week. Everybody will

1145
01:46:04,660 --> 01:46:09,300
be here. Good long power outages notwithstanding. Knock on wood, but we should be past all that.

1146
01:46:09,300 --> 01:46:13,940
Hopefully, we will be back to do it all again. Thank you guys for downloading our show or

1147
01:46:13,940 --> 01:46:17,460
listening to us live. However you participated. If you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange

1148
01:46:17,460 --> 01:46:21,060
Launch Radio, help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice,

1149
01:46:21,060 --> 01:46:25,620
but we need the voices to be here in chat. So tell a friend or two about the show. A nice

1150
01:46:25,620 --> 01:46:30,580
five star review on a site like iTunes or wherever it is you found the show. We're going off a long

1151
01:46:30,580 --> 01:46:36,740
way. Sharing the Spotify link on social media or whatever it is. All that stuff is greatly

1152
01:46:36,740 --> 01:46:42,260
appreciated. If you feel so inclined, we have a shop with merch and you can check that out

1153
01:46:42,260 --> 01:46:47,940
at vognetwork.com slash shop. You can pick yourself up a OLRT shirt or a VOG Network shirt or

1154
01:46:47,940 --> 01:46:54,660
whatever it is you want to pick up there. That is there as well. And I think that's about all I have

1155
01:46:54,660 --> 01:46:59,460
to say. I think it's time to get our final thoughts. Dark Soccer, I'll go to you because I

1156
01:46:59,460 --> 01:47:01,940
know you want to get out of here and get set up for your stream. So what's your final thought

1157
01:47:01,940 --> 01:47:07,860
tonight? Um, my final thought is I probably shouldn't have eaten this candy. And I got

1158
01:47:07,860 --> 01:47:12,340
to put that hot jacket back on in a few, but I'll probably do it partly into my stream.

1159
01:47:12,900 --> 01:47:16,100
All right. Trick or treat. I'm starting early tonight. So who knows what's going to happen?

1160
01:47:16,100 --> 01:47:20,180
Who knows? Anything's possible. All right, Dark Soccer. We'll see you later. Thanks for being

1161
01:47:20,180 --> 01:47:26,740
here. Anything can happen on Halloween. I love that. Good night. Take care. You too. Good night.

1162
01:47:27,540 --> 01:47:32,500
Uh, and then for my final thought tonight, I guess I would say, um, I'm all by myself now.

1163
01:47:32,500 --> 01:47:38,180
That's a little weird, but I would just say. All by myself. I had to do it, Rob. All right. All

1164
01:47:38,180 --> 01:47:44,500
right. Um, I don't know what else to say. Thank you. Thank you for being here. And, uh, I had

1165
01:47:44,500 --> 01:47:48,820
some great times hosting over the weekend and I'm looking forward to doing more of that in 2022.

1166
01:47:48,820 --> 01:47:53,540
Hopefully more conventions as well. Hopefully we see the world get a little more back to normal

1167
01:47:53,540 --> 01:47:59,220
so we can do that kind of stuff. And, uh, that's, that's all I got. We're going to see you again in

1168
01:47:59,220 --> 01:48:03,140
seven days. You guys have a great night, everybody. We'll see you next time here on Orange Lounge
