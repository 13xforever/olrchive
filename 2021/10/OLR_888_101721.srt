1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,880
Sony might be ushering in a new normal of direct sales and delivery with their announcement

2
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:17,600
that they will be handing out golden tickets to players allowed to purchase a PS5.

3
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:21,000
The unstated goal of this is to link purchases to unique players and keep machines out of

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,180
the hands of scalpers, since supply is chronically short as it is.

5
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:26,320
But will retailers feel slighted anyway?

6
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:28,920
Yeah, pretty likely.

7
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:32,360
This is one story in a varied night, now it's time for your hosts Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers

8
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:35,320
and Loki to tell you more about this and the rest of the week's gaming news, starting right

9
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:37,840
now on the show where every gamer has a voice.

10
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:48,280
Hello my friends, out there on the internet, welcome back to another week of the show where

11
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:50,400
every gamer has a voice.

12
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:57,020
It is Orange Lounge Radio and we are back once again with episode number 888 of our

13
00:00:57,020 --> 00:01:01,140
show for tonight, October the 17th of 2021.

14
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:03,980
My name is Rob Roberts and I'm going to do a rushed intro here.

15
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:06,780
My co-hosts DarkSakura are Jamie Summers.

16
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:07,780
Hi.

17
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:10,420
Hi, and Techmaster Loki.

18
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:11,420
Hello.

19
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:14,900
Hello, we're getting a little bit of a late start tonight.

20
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:18,580
For the folks on the podcast feed, it's a normal week, whatever.

21
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:22,180
For those that are watching live tonight, we're getting a little bit of a late start.

22
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:27,780
It's actually closer to 6.35 Pacific time where we're located, 9.35 for those of you

23
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:30,180
on the East Coast.

24
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:33,940
We do tape live, of course, every Sunday night at the Voice of Geeks Network, twitch.tv slash

25
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:36,900
vog network, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

26
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:39,460
Usually we start about 6 Pacific, 9 Eastern.

27
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:45,100
But what happened is right about 5.45 our time, I got hit with a power outage here at

28
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:50,600
OLR headquarters where we used to gather in person before the pandemic and all that stuff.

29
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:54,860
And obviously since the broadcasting stuff is here, if there's no power, we can't do

30
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:55,860
a show.

31
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:59,320
So I hastily tried to text Bobby and let him know what was going on.

32
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:04,480
Usually I would try to watch, but the cell tower I think got taken out too because my

33
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:06,760
signal was terrible.

34
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:10,520
So that part was really unfortunate, but we got through it.

35
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,520
We're here now.

36
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,520
We're just a little delayed.

37
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:18,140
So thank you very much to our pal Bobby Black Wolf who was coming back from being gone due

38
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:21,940
to a medical thing for the past couple of weeks and ended up doing a jumbo show tonight.

39
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:24,900
So thank you Bobby for vamping a little bit for us.

40
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:27,820
And I'm glad we all could be here and actually do a show.

41
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:29,420
And hi to everybody in chat.

42
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:32,060
Shehulk10 in chat says, better late than never.

43
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:33,820
Yes, I suppose that is the case.

44
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:36,500
Or as the Golden Girls say, better late than pregnant.

45
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:37,740
So there you go.

46
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:44,500
Anyhow, also, I also noticed just now in our chat live, they just hit that goal for Orange

47
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:45,740
Lounge Foodio.

48
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:47,060
So guess what, guys?

49
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:52,340
We get to do a special episode all about food and we'll do that in the coming weeks.

50
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:55,500
You guys hit that a lot sooner than we expected it to happen.

51
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:59,580
So that show is actually probably going to happen in early mid-November just because

52
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:03,180
there's a lot of stuff going on and we're not going to be here.

53
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:05,260
We're definitely not going to be here next week.

54
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:08,980
I am not going to be here because I am going to LA.

55
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:10,860
Dark Soccer is also going out of town.

56
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:12,780
And I can talk about it.

57
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:13,780
Okay.

58
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:18,140
I don't want to put you on the spot, but if you're volunteering, please talk about it.

59
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:25,840
So last week, I'm sure a lot of you know that I was talking about doing a marathon to raise

60
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:28,620
money for my friend Barbara's GoFundMe.

61
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:32,940
She'd just been diagnosed with cancer, just started chemotherapy.

62
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:45,860
And partway through the marathon, which was on Monday, I did get a message from her wife,

63
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:51,180
her partner, that she died.

64
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:59,980
She was going into the hospital for sepsis as a reaction to the chemotherapy.

65
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:13,780
It had to do with the immunosuppressants, but she died.

66
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:16,420
And I was like, well, do you need me to call?

67
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:18,220
Do you need me to do anything?

68
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:20,300
I'd like to be there for you.

69
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:21,900
And she's like, nope, keep doing the marathon.

70
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:27,460
We now need the money to pay for the funeral.

71
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:37,180
And I'm just, I'm floored about it.

72
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:46,180
And so Tiara and I, which I'm sure some of our long-term listeners here know Tiara, and

73
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:50,180
Maggie actually did sing something that we played on the show.

74
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:55,740
She did a cover of Bang Bang.

75
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:57,540
People more know it maybe from Kill Bill.

76
00:04:57,540 --> 00:05:01,620
Yeah, that's like the early OLR years, yeah, yeah.

77
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:02,620
Yeah.

78
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:06,580
So we're going out to see her and to be there for the memorial.

79
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:15,700
We're both doing a Thursday night red-eye and hoping to make a memorial on time.

80
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:19,740
But I'm super depressed.

81
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:27,460
Barbara was my papa's son and Maggie is my mama's son, and they both mean the universe

82
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:32,580
to me and Barbara went really, really fast.

83
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:38,540
And I suppose there's the part of me that's trying to be all logical and say it was better

84
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:41,420
fast than long and drawn out and painful.

85
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:48,780
And at the same time, Barbara was a fighter and I expected, I don't know what I expected

86
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:53,180
really because life is completely stupid.

87
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:54,620
It just happens.

88
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:56,940
It happens when you don't expect it.

89
00:05:56,940 --> 00:06:06,100
And which just makes me all the more want to tell our listeners, my friends, everybody,

90
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:13,380
how much I love all of you and that the world is a great place to have you in it.

91
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:19,100
And well, yeah, fuck cancer.

92
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:20,100
Fuck it.

93
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:22,860
It's terrible.

94
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:27,620
And I logically know there will never be a cure for it because cancer in and of itself

95
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:31,140
is a series of mutations.

96
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:42,220
That's not going to happen, but I would encourage everybody if you can find

97
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:49,820
a reputable charity that's doing actual cancer research and not just merchandising stuff,

98
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:51,460
donate.

99
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:59,420
And I didn't want to use the show for this, but if you can spare something for my friend's

100
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:06,420
funeral expenses, talk to me offline and I'll let you know.

101
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:07,420
And it's fine.

102
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:11,340
I don't think anyone cares that you're using the show for that because anyone that's talked

103
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:18,500
to you for a reasonable length of time, especially right after you moved here from Alabama knows

104
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:21,060
how important these folks were to you.

105
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:26,480
So I'm truly sorry that this happened.

106
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:31,060
And yeah, it certainly puts a lot in perspective of a silly power outage delaying our show,

107
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:35,260
but there's much bigger things and you're right.

108
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:38,460
When something like this happens, it happens.

109
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:42,020
And there's just not a lot we can do sometimes.

110
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:46,300
So thank you.

111
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:51,580
Thank you for sharing the story with us and the marathon, at least when I was finally

112
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:52,580
able to see it.

113
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:58,960
So I guess trying to go back to less difficult topics that the power outage thing tonight

114
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:04,520
was especially frustrating because Monday when you were doing your marathon, we had

115
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:06,180
a power outage here again.

116
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:09,580
And I don't know why all of a sudden there's all these power outages.

117
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:12,700
Somebody on Twitter had asked me, oh, is it because California, it has nothing to do with

118
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:15,060
what you're hearing in the media about wildfires and all that stuff.

119
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:18,740
That's another company, PG&E, that doesn't service where we are in Sacramento.

120
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:23,180
Sacramento has their own utility and it's nothing to do with any of that.

121
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:27,420
I really don't know why all of a sudden power outages are a problem this week.

122
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:36,080
I think it is weather related because Monday we did have a really bad windstorm and now

123
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:40,240
it's windy outside again tonight and rain is supposed to come in.

124
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:47,840
So I think it's just because the last nine months, 10 months have been so dry, it's causing

125
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:50,060
the windstorm to knock more stuff over.

126
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:53,120
And I think, you know, you just you had to happen in one area on Monday and you had to

127
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:55,320
happen here tonight.

128
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:59,920
But when I was trying to participate in Dark Soccer Marathon, we lost power for it was

129
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,840
from noon until 1030.

130
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,800
So we were out of power for 10 hours.

131
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:08,880
So that means our food in the fridge after we had just gone to Costco had to replace

132
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:09,880
it.

133
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:11,440
That's not irritating or anything.

134
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:17,160
And yes, I know there's ways to get insurance and stuff, but it's still the process is still

135
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:18,160
a pain in the ass.

136
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,160
You know what I mean?

137
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:20,160
Yeah.

138
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,720
Well, it's life in a hurricane.

139
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:22,720
Yeah.

140
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:23,720
Right.

141
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:24,720
Right.

142
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:25,720
But seriously, no.

143
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:30,600
We would keep multiple coolers on hand and buy all the ice just for stuff like that.

144
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:35,640
But I remind people of this a lot, you know, especially, you know, because I hear it a

145
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:39,000
lot when it does rain here in California.

146
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,440
Everybody from back east will say that's not a rainstorm.

147
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,440
That's nothing.

148
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:43,440
You don't know what real rain is.

149
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,440
Well, I know.

150
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,440
I know.

151
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:49,840
But the problem is, is that it's not it's not built out here for that.

152
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:53,800
And that's that's what it is, because the weather is a certain way out here that places

153
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:54,800
not built that way.

154
00:09:54,800 --> 00:10:00,480
It's the same reason you don't see brick homes here, because earthquakes can happen in California.

155
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:04,160
So we don't have brick homes like like it's just things are built a certain way because

156
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:06,680
of whatever natural disasters are tending to occur.

157
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:11,600
So we're not set up for these hurricanes and multiple power outages.

158
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:14,360
You know about the story of Disney World, right?

159
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:15,360
Which one?

160
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:20,840
They tried to build they tried to build Disney World like Disneyland.

161
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:24,840
And it mildewed and started falling apart because of the humidity.

162
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:26,400
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

163
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:30,440
So when I moved out here and I saw how things were constructed, I'm like, excuse me.

164
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:31,600
What?

165
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,600
No.

166
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:35,480
Weather's going to sneeze and this will all fall over.

167
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:40,480
And then like, I wouldn't go out on a wooden balcony for like three years after I moved

168
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,480
out here.

169
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:42,480
Sure, sure.

170
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,480
But now.

171
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:44,480
Yeah.

172
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:47,160
But now it's like, well, that's just it works here.

173
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:48,160
It's fine.

174
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:52,880
We don't until, you know, the last 10 years or so as climate change has been having its

175
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:53,880
impact.

176
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:55,440
Those sorts of things are whatever.

177
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:58,520
But anyway, we could go down a very big rabbit hole there.

178
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:00,160
We're already getting a late start tonight.

179
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:04,480
So I suppose we should shift the topic to something that often takes our minds off of

180
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:08,100
things and the other bad things going on in the world.

181
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:09,300
And that is video games.

182
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:15,560
So let's get into our kickoff topic tonight, which has to do with perhaps the future of

183
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:19,480
games of some sort or what some people want those to be anyway.

184
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:25,340
Loki, can you can you start us off with tonight's story about what Steam is going to be blocking

185
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:28,140
from their marketplace pretty soon?

186
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:30,500
I guess as they have already, I guess.

187
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:32,100
Yeah, they've already done it.

188
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:40,880
So they had blocked a few games that had NFTs or offered crypto in them.

189
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:44,780
And the reason that they did this and it makes sense when you think about it is they've gotten

190
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:50,940
in trouble before with offering items in game and having kind of an auction house where

191
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:56,620
you could potentially sell those in game items for real world cash.

192
00:11:56,620 --> 00:12:01,180
And so since they've gotten in trouble, I believe in like the European unions and stuff

193
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:09,100
like that with that, they have been basically knocking down anything that could be potentially

194
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:15,140
used to give you something of value from, you know, unlocks and games and stuff like

195
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:16,140
that.

196
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:19,340
So NFTs, of course, because you could trade them for money.

197
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:24,540
And Bitcoin, well, I mean, that's self-explanatory, you can also trade that for money.

198
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:29,900
And so they have gone ahead and removed the games that had that in there.

199
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:37,260
Like for example, Light Night and Age of Rust was a game that they had NFTs where you could

200
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:44,380
actually kind of buy the NFT and use it to unlock stuff in game or something like that.

201
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:45,380
And then there was another game.

202
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:46,380
I don't remember which one it was.

203
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:51,580
It was like a puzzle game where you got Bitcoin if you play the puzzle or something like that.

204
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:55,420
So yeah, look, it makes sense.

205
00:12:55,420 --> 00:13:01,220
Look, I and when we're talking about Bitcoin or whatever, like I and I'm not I'm not going

206
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:02,500
to dog on it or whatever.

207
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:05,740
I understand people have their environmental concerns, etc.

208
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:11,180
But I from the perspective of trying to critique what's going on here, I'm putting Bitcoin

209
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:17,180
on the same level as dollars, pesos, yen, whatever currency, it has some sort of value

210
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:21,520
in the monetary universe, whether it does to you specifically or not, it does have value

211
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:22,520
in the universe.

212
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:24,180
I mean, PayPal has Bitcoin now.

213
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:26,960
So it's it's something you can get value out of.

214
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:27,960
Right.

215
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:32,160
But but entities are kind of a gray area as well, because there's been so many scams recently

216
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:38,480
with those and like necessarily Bitcoin, but like other crypto currencies, there's been

217
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:39,480
right.

218
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:40,900
So many pump and dump schemes.

219
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:41,900
And here's the thing.

220
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:47,240
Like, as far as like the real world currency and games, Diablo three should and what it

221
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:51,560
originally was and why it had so many issues in the beginning with the real money access.

222
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:57,160
That should be informing everybody that gaming is not the place for this.

223
00:13:57,160 --> 00:14:00,640
And like everybody wants to put a get rich, quick scheme in gaming.

224
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:03,160
Diablo three showed ain't going to happen.

225
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:05,720
And like, I know people think, oh, this is different.

226
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:06,720
This is different.

227
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:07,720
No, no, no.

228
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:12,360
The problem is you're always going to have way too much supply and not enough demand,

229
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:13,640
period.

230
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:18,000
Because what's going to happen is that if it turns out you can earn even the slightest

231
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:24,880
amount of Bitcoin, you're going to have other places throughout the world that have very

232
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:30,160
questionable labor practices that are going to force people to play these games over and

233
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:34,480
over and over again to get these items to sell to those few people that are going to

234
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:35,600
buy them.

235
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:39,960
And I don't think that they're giving away Bitcoin in that sense, where it's like an

236
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:40,960
unlimited supply.

237
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:45,560
I think it's more of like kind of an incentive, like a contest, even the auction house, even

238
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:46,560
the contest.

239
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,880
They'll dump as many entries in the contest as they can.

240
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:52,320
Even the auction house, they'll spam as much in that auction house as they can for those

241
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,800
few people that can buy.

242
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:56,320
Nobody ever made money off that auction house.

243
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,200
It was.

244
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,200
That's why it went away.

245
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,440
It was money after that.

246
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:01,560
I made a quarter.

247
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:02,640
I made a quarter.

248
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:05,680
And I don't even know how I did that, to be quite honest.

249
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:09,280
More on steam than anything selling trading cards.

250
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:14,600
And now, as far as the NFT thing goes, I'm still trying to write like I get Bitcoin,

251
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:19,120
I get question mark Bitcoin, I get Ethereum and all this other knockoff.

252
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:24,400
I shouldn't call them knockoffs, but I'm sorry to me, they just get all the same to me.

253
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,720
So I get that.

254
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:30,240
I'm still trying to wrap my head around what NFT like really is like.

255
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:33,960
I guess it's like a digital type, like it's like an ownership token of some sort.

256
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:39,240
Yeah, it's a digital good that you have ownership that you can basically it's like your certificate

257
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:40,240
of authentication.

258
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,240
OK, everything.

259
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:44,200
So so here's I do think I actually get that.

260
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,880
And here's the wild thing.

261
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:47,560
This comes in the same week.

262
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:50,600
And I'm going to go down a dead by daylight rabbit hole.

263
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:54,140
But it absolutely relates to this whole story.

264
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:56,240
And Dark Soccer, you're going to know this one, too.

265
00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:00,480
It has to do with the pinhead voice lines that were going to be in the game.

266
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:03,640
You open the box and I came and I came.

267
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:08,880
Did you hear the story about why those got removed and what apparently that's all about?

268
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:14,560
A bit of it, yeah, that there was something like they wanted to bring it back in via NFT.

269
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:21,600
Yes, the license holders to that whole thing wanted to create like a Hellraiser pinhead

270
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:27,400
NFT that would get you access to pinhead in all these other things.

271
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:30,200
It would be like a pinhead unlock in all these other things.

272
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:35,580
And it would allow the voice dialog to be there in dead by daylight and I guess other

273
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:38,280
types of interactions and other games.

274
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:41,760
I'm not sure fucking pinhead is worth that.

275
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:46,480
I think Waluigi could get that judging off the past two weeks on the Internet.

276
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,520
But I don't think it had to be late.

277
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:48,920
Sorry.

278
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:53,840
Flea says that DBD released a statement that the NFT story was a fake.

279
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:54,360
Thank you.

280
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:55,280
Thank you, Flea.

281
00:16:55,280 --> 00:17:00,760
OK, I apologize for being the Fox News video game podcast right here, but it is what it is.

282
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:02,760
That story was going around.

283
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:08,080
However, OK, so thank you, Flea, for debunking the story, because that whole thing was ridiculous anyway.

284
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:17,480
But I still say that is still something people are looking for in gaming, even if it's not

285
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:24,080
true in that case, some crypto and again, I'm going to get here's the thing.

286
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:28,880
If you're going to email me explaining to me why I'm wrong, you better do it like I'm

287
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:31,040
a five year old when it comes to this stuff.

288
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:35,400
And you need to understand part of the reason why NFTs are not like the big thing right

289
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:37,720
now is because most people don't fucking understand them.

290
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:40,160
So if you're going to email me and yell at me why I'm wrong, you're going to need to

291
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,600
explain like I'm five.

292
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:43,600
Why I'm wrong.

293
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:50,200
OK, here's the whole thing is that I think some people want that to kind of be gaming,

294
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:52,560
like you buy these like unlock keys and stuff.

295
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:55,280
I'm not sure the consumer really wants that.

296
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,920
I'm really not.

297
00:17:56,920 --> 00:18:01,120
Mirror Muse in chat says NFT and crypto sound like Beanie Babies at best and pyramid schemes

298
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:02,600
at worst to me.

299
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:08,040
Let's see, Zen Monkey 11 says, I wish they had a pinhead Pez dispenser.

300
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:10,400
And oh, I didn't even realize they tweeted this.

301
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:15,680
So Mike Deff sent us a tweet from behavior that actually says there's been some talk

302
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:17,120
about NFTs.

303
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:20,660
When we work with our licensing partners, we provide them with in-game models as well

304
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:21,920
as chapter keys.

305
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:22,920
They are free to use these.

306
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:27,920
However, they say they see fit as the rightful owners of these characters.

307
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:32,000
To be very clear, there is no exclusive in-game content linked to these models when they are

308
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,280
distributed outside of the game in any way.

309
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:35,360
Oh, interesting.

310
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:36,360
So on.

311
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:43,160
Well, I got to say the way that reads to me is that maybe they were trying to like that

312
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:50,920
the Hellraiser folks are trying to bundle these DLC into key is keys and stuff, but

313
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:53,480
had nothing to do with the voice line dialog and why it was omitted.

314
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:55,160
So rabbit hole done.

315
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:59,280
I don't need to dwell on that too much, but I thought that was interesting.

316
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:00,280
That's for sure.

317
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:01,280
So.

318
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:05,360
Anyway, Loki, I know there's another half to the story.

319
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:06,360
Sorry.

320
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:07,360
Yes.

321
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:12,240
And so, of course, you know, Epic Games seizing the opportunity says, hey, guess what?

322
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:15,960
We're going to welcome NFT games since Steam banned them.

323
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:16,960
Cool.

324
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:21,320
You could get in trouble with the same entities that got in trouble or got Steam in trouble.

325
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:23,320
Or I should say maybe.

326
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:25,720
I don't know.

327
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:26,720
Good.

328
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:28,640
Glad there's a marketplace for them.

329
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:34,760
Didn't really need to step in and do that, but way to go, Tim Sweeney.

330
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:38,240
I don't know whether to read this into like Tim Sweeney's trying to be an edgelord, which

331
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:39,480
is usually the case.

332
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:45,520
Or this is just, OK, him acknowledging sometimes these purposes can be legitimate and we're

333
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:47,800
willing to be the playground for this.

334
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:51,760
It reads to me as him being very try hard to separate himself from Steam.

335
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:55,240
However, here's the thing.

336
00:19:55,240 --> 00:20:00,640
If a game company wants to try the Diablo three auction house again, go for it.

337
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:03,520
You're going to flop, but go for it like you.

338
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:06,720
You can have the ability to do that, I guess.

339
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:12,240
But yeah, I mean, if you can't learn from history, I OK.

340
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:15,160
And it's fine, like I just I don't know it.

341
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:21,500
Whatever, like, I'm not going to be like, oh, my God, I have no strong opinion on any

342
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:24,960
of this, so it's like, cool.

343
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:25,880
Good job.

344
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:26,880
Pat yourself on the back.

345
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:31,480
Like, I'm not going to use one storefront over the other because of this or that.

346
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,480
I mean, it's just.

347
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:38,600
Tim Sweeney, can we please like get some actual features like, you know, a shopping cart in

348
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:42,720
the store, please, instead of just, you know, supporting these games, can we can we can

349
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:45,280
you finish your storefront, please?

350
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:49,720
I would appreciate that first before, you know, making these grandos gestures saying

351
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:53,080
that we're going to accept these types of games and not these other types of games and

352
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:54,440
whatnot.

353
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:58,600
Because let's be honest, at the end of the day, yeah, you can get the NFT games over

354
00:20:58,600 --> 00:20:59,600
on Epic Games.

355
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:07,240
You can get all the pornography games on Steam, so I don't know.

356
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:12,680
I know I know where my loyalty lies, E3VL in chat says I got one hundred and fifty dollars

357
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:16,160
in the auction house and I was about to scream and ask questions, how, why?

358
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:20,160
But then E3VL follows that up saying not worth the time investment, though.

359
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:21,700
Good lucky drops.

360
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:25,540
So it it took a lot of work and a lot of luck to make the hundred and fifty bucks.

361
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:32,460
And I I honestly bet if you'd spent that time, I don't know, driving for Lyft or DoorDash

362
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:36,300
or doing freelancing types of work that you probably could have gotten that type of money

363
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:37,300
as well.

364
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:40,780
Like, and I'm not I'm not shading your life choices like, look, I tried to sell stuff

365
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:42,360
on the auction house, too.

366
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:47,260
It just to me, the demand wasn't there and it didn't make it, you know, really worth

367
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:48,260
it.

368
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:52,660
Anyway, in the interest of time, since we got a late start, I'm going to move on after

369
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:53,660
this story.

370
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:57,820
I'm not trying to write this off and hedge my bets on this will never be a thing or whatever,

371
00:21:57,820 --> 00:22:00,820
but I just.

372
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:06,700
It's in my opinion, it's going to need to take a company like Nintendo embracing this

373
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:09,660
before it's going to be a thing in gaming.

374
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:11,620
And I already see it's not going to happen.

375
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:13,420
It's never going to happen.

376
00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:15,700
Well, never say never.

377
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:19,620
But it's it's I'm ninety nine point nine percent.

378
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:20,620
Yeah.

379
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:21,620
Yeah.

380
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:23,820
Especially after some of the choices Nintendo's been.

381
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:24,820
Oh, yeah.

382
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:25,820
We'll get to that later.

383
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:31,340
They'll just do the Nintendo fungible tokens is what they'll have to do something stupid

384
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:32,340
like that.

385
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:33,340
But like.

386
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:40,500
No, I don't think I don't think they even understand the basics of cryptocurrency and

387
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:42,820
block chain.

388
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:44,300
That's OK, because I don't either.

389
00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:49,900
All right, let's move on, which I have I have a tiny little bit of cryptocurrency.

390
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:53,300
I just bought it when all the other you know, when all that crap was going on with GameStop

391
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:54,300
and all that stuff.

392
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:55,300
I was like, oh, this would be fun.

393
00:22:55,300 --> 00:23:00,020
I honestly looked at it no different than this is my Reno money that I put into it.

394
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:01,260
And I've made a little money.

395
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:07,220
I was at least according to my PayPal wallet, I've made a little money, but I'm not I wouldn't

396
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:09,660
put my I wouldn't put my life savings in it for sure.

397
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:10,660
That's for sure.

398
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:11,660
All right.

399
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:13,900
It is a fickle fickle thing, though.

400
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:15,660
Yeah, sure is.

401
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:19,380
OK, let's move on and talk about our gaming weeks and the types of things that we have

402
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:22,140
been playing this week, whether they involve Bitcoin or not.

403
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:23,580
Dark Soccer, I'll start with you.

404
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:26,100
How was your gaming week?

405
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:30,380
I played 12 hours worth of Dead by Daylight on Monday.

406
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:31,380
Yeah.

407
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:38,340
And then I played two hours of Grinding and Fantation and another hour of Dead by Daylight.

408
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:46,700
And then pinball where the night I'm flying out to Alabama, which is Thursday night, Dan

409
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:49,100
is hosting League at our house.

410
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:50,100
Oh, fun.

411
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:55,460
So pinballs have been all over the places, pinballs to the wall.

412
00:23:55,460 --> 00:24:00,060
Speaking of which, I was just to say, we should acknowledge California Extreme happened this

413
00:24:00,060 --> 00:24:01,060
weekend.

414
00:24:01,060 --> 00:24:02,060
I know some people that went.

415
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:04,340
I just wasn't able to get over there.

416
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:08,740
Dan bought me a badge and I didn't go because I had had my covid booster last week.

417
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:09,740
Oh, gotcha.

418
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:14,300
So I was still feeling kind of crappy.

419
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:17,660
I heard it was a good time from those that went, though, like it's kind of one of those.

420
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:18,660
We missed it.

421
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:19,740
It was good to have it back sort of things.

422
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:25,140
I would have loved to go, but it was like as much as I love that show, the times I've

423
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:29,120
been, which isn't very often, it's always at like the worst times for me.

424
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:30,380
And that's nobody's fault.

425
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:32,340
That's just a scheduling thing.

426
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:33,340
It is what it is.

427
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:36,660
I'd love to go again if if it lines up on my calendar someday.

428
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:42,060
So I know there's anything else you want to share.

429
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:43,060
I like soda.

430
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:44,060
Awesome.

431
00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:48,100
All right, let's say hello to Loki and his gaming week.

432
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:55,940
Yeah, so I played power washing simulator and or power wash simulator and I'm up to

433
00:24:55,940 --> 00:24:57,860
the carousel level now.

434
00:24:57,860 --> 00:24:58,860
Nice.

435
00:24:58,860 --> 00:24:59,860
I'm trying to think.

436
00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:04,820
Like a big treehouse, a helicopter.

437
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:07,620
I don't remember what else I had.

438
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:12,780
Oh, like an old like Winnebago or something like that.

439
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:18,900
But yeah, so it's still fun, though, slowly going through it, run out of things to unlock,

440
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:21,460
though, as far as like new equipment.

441
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:25,860
So that's kind of a disappointing, but I know it's still early access.

442
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:31,020
Yeah, they just did a patch that added new scenes, right?

443
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:32,020
Yeah.

444
00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:33,020
Yeah.

445
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:34,420
They keep adding more and more and more levels to it.

446
00:25:34,420 --> 00:25:35,420
So that's good.

447
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:39,700
I just wish they would have like there's still one more class of like power washer that you

448
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:43,940
can get, like the industrial strength one or something like that.

449
00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:45,900
And that's just not available yet.

450
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:52,620
But yeah, I'm like a player that looks like about 15 hours now.

451
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:57,940
And then, of course, Minecraft playing Minecraft.

452
00:25:57,940 --> 00:26:00,040
So I put out another video, right?

453
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:05,440
I put out another video, which I finally it's about a week turnaround time that time.

454
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:08,300
So and I'm already working on stuff for the next one.

455
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:17,700
So I'm trying to keep up with that, you know, the weekly pace there instead of biweekly

456
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:20,060
or even more infrequent than that.

457
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:21,980
It just depends on what I'm putting together.

458
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:26,140
There's a lot of like complicated builds and stuff that I'm doing, but I'm kind of getting

459
00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:27,140
to the point now.

460
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:30,700
I've been finishing up the build I'm working on now, but I want to go back to making more

461
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:31,700
farms.

462
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:33,700
So I'm probably going to do that.

463
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:34,940
Nice.

464
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:37,580
And I know there was some Minecraft news this week, but we'll get into that in a little

465
00:26:37,580 --> 00:26:38,580
bit.

466
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:39,580
Yes, there was.

467
00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:40,880
All right.

468
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:41,880
My gaming week.

469
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:45,640
So I've been trying to stream a little more often after work, and some days were better

470
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:46,640
than others.

471
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:50,540
Like Monday, obviously, the power was out, but well, and I wasn't going to stream when

472
00:26:50,540 --> 00:26:52,140
Darkstalker was doing a marathon anyway.

473
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:56,660
But the other days of the week, I was pretty much able to do stuff.

474
00:26:56,660 --> 00:27:02,700
I streamed some more Metroid Dread, and I got as far as the fight with a very familiar

475
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:04,740
face from the Metroid series.

476
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:08,580
I guess, you know, you can read into that what you want.

477
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:13,440
And the viewers watched me lose that fight probably five or six times.

478
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:17,780
So I don't know if I just didn't have enough energy tanks or gear or something to take

479
00:27:17,780 --> 00:27:19,020
on that fight.

480
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:27,080
But I will say one thing that was really holding me back, my wrist started to hurt real bad.

481
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:30,220
And those of you that were watching know that I called my stream.

482
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:33,880
I mean, I've been going for an hour and a half, two hours, which is my usual time anyway.

483
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:37,420
So I didn't feel bad about calling it what I did, but my wrist was really starting to

484
00:27:37,420 --> 00:27:38,420
hurt.

485
00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:43,540
And that kind of reads into my earlier feedback on Metroid Dread that although I think I liked

486
00:27:43,540 --> 00:27:49,220
the game more the second time I played it because I was more set up for what to expect.

487
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:53,940
And so I was getting more out of a thrill out of those me chase sequences and so forth.

488
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:58,780
Like the controls is a major problem.

489
00:27:58,780 --> 00:28:04,460
Like my wrist is hurting and like, you know, there's accessibility things that are issue

490
00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:05,460
too.

491
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:10,700
Nintendo has got to address some some configurability issues with this game.

492
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:18,020
I don't know, like it's I'm probably going to play more off stream in shorter bursts

493
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:21,140
so I can, you know, give myself breaks more when I need them.

494
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:24,780
But that was very disappointing that things got to the point where I was like hurting.

495
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:28,060
E3VL says, did you play with pro controller?

496
00:28:28,060 --> 00:28:29,260
Yes, I did.

497
00:28:29,260 --> 00:28:31,160
The Splatoon pro controller.

498
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:34,080
Shad Starsick says, I don't know how people are holding the controllers to make their

499
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:35,080
wrists hurt.

500
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:39,140
I went through the entire game with no problems like that.

501
00:28:39,140 --> 00:28:40,140
Congrats for you.

502
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:43,060
But that is not the case for me.

503
00:28:43,060 --> 00:28:44,060
So I don't know.

504
00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:51,460
So it's like I like the game, but that was a major downer, major downer.

505
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:52,460
But I'll play it more.

506
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:55,540
I just won't be doing it on stream anymore because I'm not I won't I'll be doing it for

507
00:28:55,540 --> 00:29:01,100
like 30, 45 minutes at a time so I can give myself frequent breaks.

508
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:03,300
Shad Starsick also says, oh, you know what?

509
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:04,840
I didn't use a pro controller.

510
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:06,420
Maybe that's something to do with it.

511
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:07,420
Perhaps.

512
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:10,540
I know you play mostly handheld, so maybe that, you know, kind of because that is a

513
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:12,260
big difference in how you hold it.

514
00:29:12,260 --> 00:29:13,260
Maybe that did make a difference.

515
00:29:13,260 --> 00:29:14,620
I don't know.

516
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:15,620
So we'll see.

517
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:16,620
Let's see.

518
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:20,020
I did play some other stuff as well.

519
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:25,420
I also played I got into a new game this week called Dungeon Encounters.

520
00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:26,620
That was interesting.

521
00:29:26,620 --> 00:29:30,140
So that is the game that they showed at, I think, the last Nintendo Direct.

522
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:34,340
There was kind of a Squeenix game that came out of nowhere that was by the guy who designed

523
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:38,100
like Final Fantasy 12 and Tactics and stuff like that.

524
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:42,380
And it just came out on Steam, I think PS4 and Switch this week.

525
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:43,980
And so I played this game on stream.

526
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:47,900
It's the one where it looks like you're running around these crossword puzzles that have numbers

527
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:50,040
in them and you get into these fights.

528
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:54,060
And that is what the game is.

529
00:29:54,060 --> 00:29:58,660
I played it on stream and about 30 minutes into it, I was like, oh, this game is this

530
00:29:58,660 --> 00:30:00,100
game is terrible.

531
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:01,380
Like I, I don't know.

532
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:02,860
I don't know what they were thinking with this.

533
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:07,080
This is very clearly somebody's art project that's gone really, really wrong.

534
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:10,640
And that's why this is being released without much fanfare.

535
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:14,640
But by the time I got to the end of the stream, I started to just kind of notice things about

536
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:18,760
it where I was like, you know what, you know what I think this is?

537
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:28,960
I think this game is like a 1980s PC RPG, but done for a PlayStation 4 and Steam.

538
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:32,780
Like seriously, like when you look at these maps and like the whole thing is that there's

539
00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:38,020
there's no artwork beyond like there's no, there's a stairs drawn that the monsters are

540
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:39,420
not drawn on the map.

541
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:42,260
Everything is represented by hexadecimal numbers.

542
00:30:42,260 --> 00:30:45,980
So you have to remember two is a staircase that goes up.

543
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:48,600
One is a staircase that goes down.

544
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:51,840
Six is a place that can heal all your life.

545
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:54,820
Five is a place that you can resurrect everybody.

546
00:30:54,820 --> 00:31:00,760
Now that really reminds me of, I'm, I'm talking to go way back to 80s PC gaming.

547
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:07,000
I'm not talking about rogue likes, I'm talking about fucking Rogue, the original Rogue.

548
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:10,320
Anybody ever play Rogue on the PC or whatever it was on?

549
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:11,320
It was ported to everything.

550
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:12,320
Ages ago.

551
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:13,320
Ages ago, right.

552
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:17,840
And in that game, like monsters were represented by letters of the alphabet.

553
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:21,280
And so like, like it's that kind of feel.

554
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:25,760
So I kind of, and it's interesting because some of the puzzles then become, okay, you

555
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:30,720
have to use these abilities to warp up a floor to where you were to get to this section.

556
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:35,080
That maybe you weren't able to reach before these, that they are puzzles that are straight

557
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:41,120
out of like Ultima and those games that were big back in the day then.

558
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:43,840
Bobby Blackpool says, did you do a steam refund for it?

559
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:48,080
I thought about it, but I didn't because I let the viewers vote if they wanted to see

560
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:49,120
it again.

561
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:51,480
And yes, overwhelmingly won.

562
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:55,560
So there's that, but also just the fact that by the end of it, I was kind of getting a

563
00:31:55,560 --> 00:32:00,000
little more into it, but I think the game extremely has its shortcomings.

564
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,160
I'm willing to kind of see the puzzles through.

565
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:09,120
I can deal with a retro inspired game and things like that, but, um, I, I'm just not

566
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:13,400
sure why they felt getting rid of art direction altogether.

567
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:18,600
Well, I guess I shouldn't say that because I mean, they did design still pictures of

568
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:19,600
characters.

569
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:20,600
I mean, it's very minimal.

570
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:21,600
This game is very minimalist.

571
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:25,940
And I said that word a lot on the stream was a real choice for this game.

572
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:32,680
I'm telling you, if they had taken this same game and use that same engine that they're

573
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:37,400
using for Bravely default, and now the triangle strategy game, whatever that is, if they'd

574
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:42,300
use that same engine, they'd actually drawn assets instead of numbers for some of those

575
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:46,340
things, but use the same maps and dungeons made the battles work the same because the

576
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:50,140
battle system is interesting because you have like a physical defense shield and a magical

577
00:32:50,140 --> 00:32:52,660
defense shield, and then you have the HP underneath that.

578
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:55,920
So you have to crack through one of the shields before you get to the health.

579
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:57,100
It's an interesting mechanic.

580
00:32:57,100 --> 00:33:03,900
All they had to do was use like the, um, Octopath traveler interface and that whole thing for

581
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:04,900
that.

582
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:09,100
And I honestly think they would have had a hit on their hands.

583
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:16,740
I don't know why they decided to keep this minimalist eighties RPG in auto PlayStation

584
00:33:16,740 --> 00:33:18,580
four type of thing.

585
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:20,060
Was it worth $30?

586
00:33:20,060 --> 00:33:23,900
No, I don't think so.

587
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:27,560
I know there's going to, I know there's going to be people, I, the thing is this game is

588
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:32,800
going to have it's dedicated fans, but I think most people aren't going to get it.

589
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:35,920
I barely get it.

590
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:39,160
So I just, I think it's on four.

591
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:44,260
I think, again, I think I just told you how this game could have been like 10 times better

592
00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:49,280
is to take down some of those minimalist walls and adapt an engine that you've already been

593
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:53,500
using on other projects and play it to this vision of how the battle should run and things

594
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:54,500
like that.

595
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:56,200
And I think you would have had a hit on your hands.

596
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:58,200
Oh, well.

597
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:01,040
Anyway, um, let's see.

598
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:04,720
Um, other games I played this week, I guess I streamed a little bit of dead by daylight

599
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:05,760
on Friday.

600
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:08,120
I've decided I'm retired from cookie clicker.

601
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:09,360
I have clicked all the cookies.

602
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:10,360
I will click.

603
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:11,360
Yes, I'm done.

604
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:16,120
I'm done because I've hit the point where it's like, I've gotten every, every, except

605
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:19,560
for one heavenly Ascension talent, which most people will play a game.

606
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:22,840
Don't even know what the fuck that is, but that's when you ascend by getting so many

607
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:24,220
cookies and start the game over.

608
00:34:24,220 --> 00:34:25,580
You get talents that roll over.

609
00:34:25,580 --> 00:34:30,260
I have all of them except for one, which is a very specific hard to do thing that I just

610
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:32,000
don't feel like doing.

611
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:37,780
And for those that know cookie clicker, it's the one where you ascend the chips as 777777.

612
00:34:37,780 --> 00:34:41,620
You have to have all six of the last digit sevens, uh, to get the last one.

613
00:34:41,620 --> 00:34:42,620
I got the other two.

614
00:34:42,620 --> 00:34:44,020
That's just seven and seven, seven, seven.

615
00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:45,860
And the 777 one was annoying enough.

616
00:34:45,860 --> 00:34:47,020
I didn't want to do the other one.

617
00:34:47,020 --> 00:34:48,780
Yes, I know you sell your buildings.

618
00:34:48,780 --> 00:34:49,780
So you go slower.

619
00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:50,780
Did I know how to do it?

620
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,840
I just don't want to do it.

621
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:55,860
And I'm not going to do something in a video game I don't want to do.

622
00:34:55,860 --> 00:34:58,360
So I've decided to retire from the cookies.

623
00:34:58,360 --> 00:35:02,500
I got like 430 something achievements in that game.

624
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:03,500
I'm good.

625
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:06,000
I'm, I'm never going to get that many achievements in a video game.

626
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:09,240
One other game I played a little bit of this week, Diablo two resurrected.

627
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:12,280
So I did finally pick that up and I've put a little time into that.

628
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:17,280
And that, so it's interesting because that is a old, old school at this point, right?

629
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:19,920
From like the late nineties, uh, RPG.

630
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:25,580
And so some of those elements haven't aged well, especially the quality of life stuff.

631
00:35:25,580 --> 00:35:30,740
But with that one, especially with the nicer graphics and everything looks really sharp

632
00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:33,240
and I'm actually enjoying it.

633
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:37,280
Even though I'm like, God, it's a pain in the ass to keep going back to town and stuff.

634
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:38,880
It doesn't bother me.

635
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,220
Like I'm actually kind of enjoying it.

636
00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:44,300
And I think they did a really good job with that.

637
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:47,140
Bobby Black Wolf in chat says, grandma is sad, Rob.

638
00:35:47,140 --> 00:35:49,560
Well, the aliens ate her.

639
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:50,560
Spoiler alert.

640
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:51,560
All right.

641
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:54,720
Uh, E3VL says, did you get login issues?

642
00:35:54,720 --> 00:36:00,080
I got a queue of 17 on Saturday, but otherwise to dodge the login issues in that game for

643
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:01,080
the most.

644
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:04,800
I heard it was pretty bad, but for the, for E as of now, it hasn't really hit me yet.

645
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:07,020
So, all right, let's move on.

646
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:08,020
We got a late start tonight.

647
00:36:08,020 --> 00:36:11,400
So I want to jump into some news, uh, again, housekeeping.

648
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:15,560
We will not be here live next week, Halloween.

649
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:16,720
I haven't figured out yet.

650
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:20,600
I meant to talk about this with my goes before we were live, but then the whole power out

651
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:21,600
of situation.

652
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:24,080
Is anyone else going to be here on Halloween night?

653
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:25,200
Yes.

654
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:26,200
You will be here.

655
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:27,200
It's true.

656
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:28,200
Okay.

657
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:31,200
So Jamie and I will be here that night with a show.

658
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:35,480
Uh, Loki gets the night off to spend with kids so that I just don't want to go two weeks

659
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:36,600
without a show if we can help it.

660
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:40,360
So, um, but if you want to do a segment in advance or something, Loki, we can always

661
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:41,360
do that.

662
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:43,400
So, all right, we'll see what's going on that week.

663
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:44,400
All right.

664
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:45,400
Good times.

665
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:46,400
All right.

666
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:48,080
Halloween night.

667
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:49,800
So dark soccer and I will scare you.

668
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:55,640
Maybe, maybe if we have a short show, maybe I'll let her kill me again in dead by daylight.

669
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:56,920
Cause that was kind of fun.

670
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:59,040
Dude, the kill your friends thing is fun.

671
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:02,520
Did you see my very, very, very slow, uh, piggy tea bag?

672
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:04,080
I mean, yeah, yes I did.

673
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:07,040
And that kill your friends thing was very one-sided.

674
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:10,280
It's very hard to do when there's only two survivors, but it was more about, it really

675
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:15,320
is hard with only two in that love in the corn it is for me.

676
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:18,640
It was more about just getting to throw the pallet down on you and then teabag you.

677
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:24,720
And I was satisfied because I was like, I know she's cussing me out.

678
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:31,120
I was most of the time going, Oh, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, no, Rob, no.

679
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:32,120
All right.

680
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:34,000
Uh, let's move on to some news.

681
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:38,640
So we won't be here next week while, um, dark soccer is out in Alabama and that's a very

682
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:40,360
serious thing.

683
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:42,440
I'm going to Disneyland next week.

684
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:46,560
So, um, uh, if, if they, if Disneyland hadn't gotten rid of Duffy, I would have brought

685
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:50,320
you back a Duffy, something dark soccer, but, um, I don't know.

686
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:52,320
Do you still do pins?

687
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:57,720
I do still do, do pins and you know, I love Tron stuff.

688
00:37:57,720 --> 00:38:02,120
Well, so do I, so if I find it, I'll be buying it for myself, but if I find two, if Alan

689
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:04,160
does this take the Maleficent stuff.

690
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:05,160
Okay.

691
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:06,160
Fair.

692
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:07,160
Fair.

693
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:08,160
All right.

694
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:10,240
Um, I just want to see how much of the parks we can get done in a day.

695
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:11,960
So we're only going for the one day.

696
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:17,000
So I really want to ride some of the new stuff are like, yeah, I'm, I'm curious about how

697
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:20,360
that's going to feel with COVID and everything too, but I figured, you know what, if I got

698
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:25,320
through dragon con, I'll get through this and I'm vaccinated, I have no problem with

699
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:26,320
masks, whatever.

700
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:27,320
It'll be fine.

701
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:28,320
The number is a booster.

702
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:29,320
Yeah.

703
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:33,480
I want to get a, well, I want to get a booster, but at the same time I have Moderna, so we're

704
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:34,480
kind of waiting.

705
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:35,480
Yeah.

706
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:36,480
It hurts.

707
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:37,480
It still hurts.

708
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:38,480
I'm still right here.

709
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:40,120
It's still really tender.

710
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:41,400
You know what really hurts?

711
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:42,400
What?

712
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:43,400
COVID-19.

713
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:44,400
All right.

714
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:45,400
Well, duh.

715
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:51,240
But I'm still saying that this, this one hurt worse than the other, the other two.

716
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:54,360
Most people said this, the third wasn't as bad as the second.

717
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:55,360
Hmm.

718
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:56,360
Interesting.

719
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:57,360
All right.

720
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:58,920
But I also have another condition, so.

721
00:38:58,920 --> 00:38:59,920
Ah, fair.

722
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:00,920
All right.

723
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:01,920
Um, let's move on.

724
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:04,080
We got some gaming news to get to as promised.

725
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:06,600
Loki is going to talk about his fave.

726
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:07,600
Minecraft.

727
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:08,600
Yes.

728
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:09,600
We're going to talk about Minecraft.

729
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:13,840
So Minecraft live 2021 was this weekend and we had lots of announcements.

730
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:18,320
So this is normally the event, normally in the past when we're not in COVID, it would

731
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:22,440
be a live event that you would be able to go to and experience everything kind of like

732
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:27,780
a fan festival, but the last few years have been just purely digital.

733
00:39:27,780 --> 00:39:30,980
So they talked about, you know, new updates coming out.

734
00:39:30,980 --> 00:39:33,860
Obviously we have one 18 right around the corner by the end of this year.

735
00:39:33,860 --> 00:39:38,000
So they talked about some of the updates with that, just kind of showcasing, you know, some

736
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,640
of the changes that are becoming, which we kind of knew anyways, because they're doing

737
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:46,080
the snapshot, uh, releases, um, until the final release comes out.

738
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:51,560
Um, but then of course we got the news that the deep dark and the warden have been delayed

739
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:55,680
to one 19, but then they finally showed off what they're doing with that.

740
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:57,720
And they're really, you've expanded it out now.

741
00:39:57,720 --> 00:40:02,440
So the one 19 update, which is coming out next year is going to be called the wild update.

742
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:04,940
And it adds, uh, lots of different changes to it.

743
00:40:04,940 --> 00:40:07,800
One being of course, adding the deep dark to it.

744
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:12,520
The deep dark for those who don't know, is a very, very scary place that they've added

745
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:13,520
to Minecraft.

746
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:15,320
It's almost like a horror update.

747
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:21,880
Um, it's this place where there's a bunch of these like kind of growths on the ground

748
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:27,300
that are all triggered by sound and it can cause this thing that basically creates darkness.

749
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:31,120
And then the warden is this giant monster that comes out of the ground.

750
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:34,760
Um, if you make too much noise, it's very crazy.

751
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:35,760
You got it.

752
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:39,040
You got to honestly watch the trailers because the sound design that they have in there,

753
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:41,560
although the environment sounds, it's just so freaky.

754
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:45,760
Like I can't wait to play it because it, I remember when I first played Minecraft on

755
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:50,800
the Xbox 360, like when you don't know what anything is and you know, like, okay, well

756
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:52,440
creepers are going to blow up and they're going to kill me.

757
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:55,960
And I remember how like scared I really was, you know, with the creepers.

758
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:57,600
Why are we talking past tense?

759
00:40:57,600 --> 00:41:01,880
That shit still scares me when I play Minecraft now and now it's not so bad.

760
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:05,480
Like, you know, like if I run across enemies, I know I'm not too worried about them, but

761
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:09,000
like before it was like, Oh my God, I got like, you got to hide in the house, you know,

762
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,140
through the night and stuff like that.

763
00:41:10,140 --> 00:41:13,760
But now do you know what creepers need?

764
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:15,840
Creepers need the terror radius from dead by daylight.

765
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:16,840
That's what they need.

766
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:20,280
So you have that heartbeat anyway.

767
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:21,280
And the red stain.

768
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:22,280
Yes.

769
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:26,280
So, yeah, so that was on the, the announced that all the different stuff they're adding

770
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:31,400
to like the skull sensor and the skull shrieker is the one that causes the darkness and it's

771
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:33,080
the effect is just really awesome.

772
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:38,000
But outside of that, though, the wildlife is going to do some revamps for existing biomes.

773
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:41,160
So they're going to be updating the swamp biome.

774
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:45,440
With that, they're going to be adding some new biomes, including mangrove trees, which

775
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:46,920
is pretty cool.

776
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:49,480
Chest boats, frogs.

777
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:52,640
They're going to add mud into the game, which is going to be a new block.

778
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:54,560
You can make mud bricks now.

779
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:57,120
And then of course, fireflies, which would be pretty cool.

780
00:41:57,120 --> 00:42:00,440
That's just some of this other time, but they're also going to be redoing the birch forest.

781
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:03,800
And I think that there's probably going to be even more biomes that they go through and

782
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:04,800
kind of overhaul.

783
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:07,200
But those are kind of the stuff that they showed off right now.

784
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:12,000
But they're trying to focus more on like the environment and bringing like the nature part

785
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,000
out of things.

786
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:16,280
So maybe environment sounds and whatnot.

787
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:20,120
So that was a lot of stuff that they talked about, like actual Java Minecraft in Bedrock.

788
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:26,600
Loki, but but if they're adding mud, can I get naked and wear nothing but mud?

789
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:29,680
I mean, no, you can't.

790
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:30,960
You can't wear mud.

791
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:33,000
What kind of fake ass game is this?

792
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,280
You can make your skin look like mud.

793
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:37,000
But yeah.

794
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:42,680
So other cool things that they announced that starting November, Games Pass is going to

795
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:46,400
have Minecraft on PC.

796
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:51,880
So that includes both the Windows 10 edition, which is Bedrock and the Java edition.

797
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:55,560
So that'll be included with Games Pass, which is pretty awesome.

798
00:42:55,560 --> 00:42:59,280
Along with that, they're showing off some updates for Minecraft Dungeons.

799
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:03,480
So Minecraft Dungeons is going to get something similar to what we have in Diablo 3, where

800
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:07,040
they have like the different seasonal events that go on.

801
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:12,600
So they're going to have these seasonal adventures, as well as this Cloudy Climb and the Echoing

802
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:16,160
Void DLC, which looks interesting.

803
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:20,160
And then of course, they did the mob vote this year as well.

804
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:24,360
So they announced a few different mobs that they're going to be adding to the game.

805
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:29,560
The Alay one, which is kind of like this fairy creature thing that's able to gather items

806
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:31,440
for you.

807
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:34,520
They have like a copper golem was another one that would have been pretty cool.

808
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:36,640
It's got like a little robot thing.

809
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:41,200
And then this Alay, which looks like a flying Oscar the Grouch, which I'm not really or

810
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:47,280
not the Alay, but the the glare, which would point out where dark places are like I'd like

811
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:51,920
I need something to point out where it's dark.

812
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:54,440
So yeah, lots of big announcements.

813
00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:56,000
Very excited about the updates.

814
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:02,720
Definitely go watch the trailer for the deep dark stuff because oh my God, it looks really

815
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:06,040
cool, but also really creepy.

816
00:44:06,040 --> 00:44:08,600
But I'm very much looking forward to that next year.

817
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:11,880
It's nice to see that there's still quite a variety of content still being planned for

818
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:14,320
that game when you consider how old it is.

819
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:19,280
Well, you've got to see 1.18 is going to completely redesign like everything in the game.

820
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:24,720
It's going to completely redesign the caves in the game, making it very interesting and

821
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:25,720
adding a lot more features.

822
00:44:25,720 --> 00:44:28,720
So that alone is going to totally change the game.

823
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:32,720
And then all these additional features are going back and kind of instead of say, OK,

824
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:36,400
well, this is a birch forest and it looks exactly like a regular forest, but there's

825
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:41,240
birch trees and they're actually making things very distinct and adding the small details

826
00:44:41,240 --> 00:44:42,560
in there.

827
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:47,120
All right, well, I look forward to your videos showing them all off.

828
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:48,880
Yes, of course.

829
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:54,560
All right, moving on, let's let's talk about, OK, so another crafting game of a different

830
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:58,960
sort and one that consumed our lives last year, Animal Crossing.

831
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:00,880
And this week, pay attention to our saga.

832
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:02,600
This week we watch the whole thing.

833
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:03,600
Did you?

834
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:04,600
All right.

835
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:09,440
We had a whole direct dedicated to Animal Crossing and there is going to be one more

836
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:10,440
free update.

837
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:11,760
And they are saying this is the last one.

838
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:16,240
There's a 2.0 update coming November 5th and there's going to be some new characters coming

839
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:17,240
for.

840
00:45:17,240 --> 00:45:19,120
Well, new old characters, the Animal Crossing series.

841
00:45:19,120 --> 00:45:22,800
So some of the characters they kind of left out from last time are going to be added to

842
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:24,080
the game.

843
00:45:24,080 --> 00:45:28,520
They're actually going to add Brewster as well, who's going to open up a not Starbucks,

844
00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:34,600
but some type of coffee cafe that's at the Roost, the Roost, which is inspired from the

845
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:38,040
DS games right where that first appeared.

846
00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:39,040
Right.

847
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:41,120
Also, Cap'n is coming back.

848
00:45:41,120 --> 00:45:46,680
So even though there's no island to visit per se, Cap'n is still going to oh, no, I

849
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:49,240
guess he is taking you to different islands with his boat.

850
00:45:49,240 --> 00:45:50,240
So I don't know what we're going to find on them.

851
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:52,800
And it has Katrina and all the other folks there.

852
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:53,800
Oh, OK.

853
00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:55,240
That'll be cool.

854
00:45:55,240 --> 00:45:56,320
So that's neat.

855
00:45:56,320 --> 00:45:59,000
There's also going to be some more shops at Harv's Island.

856
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:00,920
That island already exists.

857
00:46:00,920 --> 00:46:03,440
There will be cooking and growing vegetables.

858
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:07,780
So I think because they datamined like pumpkin and stuff in that game a long time ago, right?

859
00:46:07,780 --> 00:46:10,840
So there's other vegetables that will be or squash or something that's going to be coming

860
00:46:10,840 --> 00:46:12,200
to the game for that.

861
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:17,120
So that's so all that stuff they datamined forever ago finally coming to the game.

862
00:46:17,120 --> 00:46:23,600
Also coming out is the only I said the first and I assume only paid DLC for Animal Crossing

863
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:25,960
is going to be Happy Home Paradise.

864
00:46:25,960 --> 00:46:30,360
I, of course, instantly thought of Dark Sakura and all the time she spent playing Happy Home

865
00:46:30,360 --> 00:46:36,320
Designer, because this is basically that right.

866
00:46:36,320 --> 00:46:38,760
Happy Home Paradise is basically that right.

867
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:41,240
I have to pay the twenty five bucks for it.

868
00:46:41,240 --> 00:46:43,720
Well, they also have it like where you can design.

869
00:46:43,720 --> 00:46:44,880
It's not just homes, though.

870
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:47,800
You're doing like schools and theaters and stuff like that, too.

871
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:48,800
Yeah.

872
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:50,520
That's what it was like in Happy Home Designer, too.

873
00:46:50,520 --> 00:46:56,120
You had different themes and stuff, but you also had to do that when you're designing

874
00:46:56,120 --> 00:47:03,620
like you're shopping, plus the and everything to the last in the DS one.

875
00:47:03,620 --> 00:47:07,960
The thing I'm most excited about are the gyroids are coming back to the game finally.

876
00:47:07,960 --> 00:47:10,200
So that will get me to visit the island.

877
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:13,180
And I'm sure ketchup is going to ask me where the fuck have you been, asshole?

878
00:47:13,180 --> 00:47:14,720
So we'll see.

879
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:19,160
I'm sure a lot of people are going to probably visit their town for the first time in a while

880
00:47:19,160 --> 00:47:20,160
with this.

881
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:23,480
I mean, our soccer, even you kind of stop the daily grind of Animal Crossing.

882
00:47:23,480 --> 00:47:26,160
But is this is this enough to get you to fire up?

883
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:28,520
No, I'm definitely going to definitely going to come back.

884
00:47:28,520 --> 00:47:32,880
I think I like also that those islands that they have for captain now where you can go

885
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:35,600
there and the islands are different.

886
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:39,840
They could be different seasons or time of day, which is kind of interesting.

887
00:47:39,840 --> 00:47:43,680
So you don't really necessarily time travel.

888
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:45,080
So they've got that in there as well.

889
00:47:45,080 --> 00:47:49,020
Plus, they're going to have like unique stuff that you can do in there.

890
00:47:49,020 --> 00:47:52,840
I like all the different like building stuff you can do there with the where you can add

891
00:47:52,840 --> 00:47:54,760
permanent ladders and whatnot.

892
00:47:54,760 --> 00:47:57,120
I think that's pretty cool.

893
00:47:57,120 --> 00:48:01,560
Looking in chat, a fifth dream says I hate digging up gyroids, but them reacting to music

894
00:48:01,560 --> 00:48:02,560
will be great.

895
00:48:02,560 --> 00:48:05,920
E3VL sharing the island friend code there in chat.

896
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:07,120
I love that.

897
00:48:07,120 --> 00:48:09,400
Also saying I stopped playing back in June.

898
00:48:09,400 --> 00:48:13,240
Love the new content, but too much of a time commitment for me to start up again.

899
00:48:13,240 --> 00:48:16,680
See a Tiberian chat says it looks like the happy home design DLC is going to permit some

900
00:48:16,680 --> 00:48:19,160
additional villagers to be more permanent.

901
00:48:19,160 --> 00:48:22,360
I thought that was part of the update was that more villagers because I know there's

902
00:48:22,360 --> 00:48:26,220
going to be new new amiibo cards and everything to to support some of the new villagers.

903
00:48:26,220 --> 00:48:30,720
So I'm not sure I have to be honest, I had to read the cliff notes because I wasn't able

904
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:31,720
to watch the thing live.

905
00:48:31,720 --> 00:48:33,600
So I didn't see everything.

906
00:48:33,600 --> 00:48:36,520
But Dark Saga, did you catch how the new villagers work?

907
00:48:36,520 --> 00:48:39,760
Is that just villagers they're adding or are they tied to the happy home design deal?

908
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:40,840
I missed that.

909
00:48:40,840 --> 00:48:42,960
I didn't see that part.

910
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:48,000
I didn't see anything about new villagers, but they did mention that you can use those

911
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:52,960
cards, I think, to invite them to come to Brewster's.

912
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:53,960
Maybe that's what it is.

913
00:48:53,960 --> 00:48:57,600
Basically, they have them come join you for coffee.

914
00:48:57,600 --> 00:48:58,600
But I don't know.

915
00:48:58,600 --> 00:48:59,600
They didn't.

916
00:48:59,600 --> 00:49:01,280
I don't think they mentioned anything about adding villagers.

917
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:05,320
The only thing they said is that they've added additional bridges so you can do a total of

918
00:49:05,320 --> 00:49:10,240
10 bridges and 10 slopes now instead of eight.

919
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:11,960
And what else?

920
00:49:11,960 --> 00:49:16,440
They also have that shed that you can get like a almost like a gardening shed or something

921
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:20,080
that you can access your home inventory outside your home.

922
00:49:20,080 --> 00:49:24,000
You can put that anywhere in your map, which is kind of cool.

923
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:27,320
There's lots of things that they're announcing.

924
00:49:27,360 --> 00:49:31,080
I mean, it's a very robust update, that's for sure.

925
00:49:31,080 --> 00:49:36,360
Yeah, it's definitely it's this feels a little late in the cycle for this to come out, but

926
00:49:36,360 --> 00:49:40,360
I understand Covid probably screwed a lot of stuff up, so I'm not being too critical.

927
00:49:40,360 --> 00:49:42,440
Yeah, Covid, how dare you?

928
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:47,000
So but yeah, this will be a nice kind of way to wrap this all up.

929
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:50,000
And then I'm assuming they're going to move on to the next Animal Crossing game after

930
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:51,000
this.

931
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:52,000
But we'll see.

932
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:53,000
All right.

933
00:49:53,160 --> 00:49:58,200
Anyway, let's move on, because there was another big thing that kind of got detailed that same

934
00:49:58,200 --> 00:50:02,160
day because it goes along with that DLC that our soccer was talking about.

935
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:03,560
This is this.

936
00:50:03,560 --> 00:50:07,080
This could have easily been the kickoff tonight because a lot of people talking about this,

937
00:50:07,080 --> 00:50:08,560
but there's some drama.

938
00:50:08,560 --> 00:50:12,520
Nintendo's been our kickoff a lot, so I have feelings about this.

939
00:50:12,520 --> 00:50:15,040
Yeah, well, let's get to it.

940
00:50:15,080 --> 00:50:23,000
So one of the other things that was listed was a Nintendo Switch online expansion pack.

941
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:27,120
And I'll just go ahead and go through the basics on it.

942
00:50:27,120 --> 00:50:31,080
It's expanding the subscription service with a premium tier.

943
00:50:31,080 --> 00:50:38,800
It's going to happen later this month, around October 25th, that it is going to have the

944
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:46,080
base service plus additional items such as a library of Nintendo 64 and Sega Genesis

945
00:50:46,080 --> 00:50:47,720
games.

946
00:50:47,720 --> 00:50:55,200
Individual membership will be 50 bucks, and then a family membership will be 80 bucks.

947
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:58,440
And people are like, why?

948
00:50:58,440 --> 00:50:59,440
This is expensive.

949
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:00,440
Why?

950
00:51:00,440 --> 00:51:01,640
And they're pretty pissed about it.

951
00:51:01,640 --> 00:51:06,720
I mean, there's even like the boycott the thing and they'll be forced to lower the price.

952
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:07,760
This is Nintendo.

953
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:08,920
People are going to pay for it.

954
00:51:08,920 --> 00:51:10,240
They don't care.

955
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:11,680
You can sort of call me people.

956
00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:15,160
I'm not quite at the extent that you're at, but I'm very much of the mindset.

957
00:51:15,160 --> 00:51:18,960
Vote with your wallet and I will be voting no on this.

958
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:25,120
Like this is, I mean, I can sort of see where folks can justify the price a little easier

959
00:51:25,120 --> 00:51:29,640
if they were planning on getting this Happy Home Design DLC anyway.

960
00:51:29,640 --> 00:51:31,120
I'm getting the DLC.

961
00:51:31,120 --> 00:51:32,120
Yeah.

962
00:51:32,120 --> 00:51:36,120
But are you going to get this super expansion pack thingy?

963
00:51:36,120 --> 00:51:41,440
If the person who manages the family plan that I am a member of wants to, I will gladly

964
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:43,440
pay more for my part of it.

965
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:45,760
It's it's and it's probably a better deal on the family plan.

966
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:48,560
In fact, I know it is, but I'm not on that.

967
00:51:48,560 --> 00:51:49,880
So let me let me see.

968
00:51:49,880 --> 00:51:52,800
30 bucks more for up to eight users.

969
00:51:52,800 --> 00:52:00,800
So keep in mind, that would roughly be for for a year of this, mind you, 10 bucks per

970
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:05,200
person for a year on a family plan.

971
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:12,560
Yeah, I'm I'm not pissed about it, but I you know, I'm not on a family plan and I don't

972
00:52:12,560 --> 00:52:14,560
know. I'm on the plan with with JD.

973
00:52:14,560 --> 00:52:19,080
Sure. And people could say, well, Rob, you should get on a family plan.

974
00:52:19,080 --> 00:52:21,920
And I would say, y'all are game in the system anyway.

975
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:24,320
So whatever, you know, which is fine.

976
00:52:24,320 --> 00:52:27,920
Which there's nothing wrong. You're working within the confines that Nintendo gave you.

977
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:32,760
But speaking as somebody who is not on one of these shared family plans or whatever, and

978
00:52:32,760 --> 00:52:37,800
even if I was a Mike Defton chat says that he voted no, but the rest of the people on his

979
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:39,120
family plan voted yes.

980
00:52:39,120 --> 00:52:40,800
So they're going to be upgrading to this.

981
00:52:41,560 --> 00:52:44,000
I think I think this is crap.

982
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:46,600
I think this is really crap what they're doing.

983
00:52:46,600 --> 00:52:52,920
I think this is this is crap to the level that like somebody in a higher up at Nintendo

984
00:52:52,920 --> 00:52:54,920
ought to have their role reexamined.

985
00:52:54,920 --> 00:52:58,360
This is so bad because this value is garbage.

986
00:52:58,600 --> 00:53:01,600
And what's really irritating about it.

987
00:53:01,600 --> 00:53:05,880
It's not even just the value that's that's because, you know, sure, you get the Happy Home

988
00:53:05,880 --> 00:53:08,440
Designer DLC, you know, quote unquote free.

989
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:10,800
But this claim, though, can I finish?

990
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:12,040
Can I finish? Can I finish?

991
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:18,240
Because that is just for this year, because next year you're going to have to re up and pay

992
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:19,640
that DLC again.

993
00:53:19,640 --> 00:53:24,760
You know, it's going to be like PlayStation Plus or, you know, Xbox Gold or whatever, where

994
00:53:24,760 --> 00:53:27,800
once you stop paying, then you no longer have that DLC.

995
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:32,800
For most people, a year is probably enough to well experience the Happy Home Designer DLC,

996
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:37,840
whatever. But I think this whole fact that the games that they're including with the N64 and

997
00:53:37,840 --> 00:53:41,440
the Genesis stuff, it's it's not up to the level to justify that cost.

998
00:53:41,600 --> 00:53:44,160
And this is what really irritates me.

999
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:45,680
And fucking wait, people.

1000
00:53:46,760 --> 00:53:52,240
This is what's going to happen, because because the value of this higher dollar plan is so

1001
00:53:52,240 --> 00:53:56,000
bad, they're going to have to start to dump more into it.

1002
00:53:56,400 --> 00:54:02,600
And so what's now now Nintendo for no reason has created two levels of this Nintendo online

1003
00:54:02,840 --> 00:54:08,240
and this base plan that's been giving us Tetris 99, Mario 99 and all this stuff.

1004
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,920
Get ready, because all that's going to go away and get.

1005
00:54:12,160 --> 00:54:16,040
Now, I'm not saying they're going to take away those specific games, but the future stuff

1006
00:54:16,040 --> 00:54:19,440
is going to go to the higher dollar plan, because that's where Nintendo wants to put the

1007
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:24,320
people. Honestly, they should have just probably upped the price for everybody by 10

1008
00:54:24,320 --> 00:54:28,000
bucks and thrown all this in and just said, here's what we're doing to justify the price

1009
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:32,400
cost. And I would probably feel a lot I wouldn't feel so much like, well, those of us that

1010
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:35,280
opt to keep the base plan are going to get fucked over like I feel now.

1011
00:54:35,560 --> 00:54:38,800
I think this whole like two track thing is disaster in the making.

1012
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:42,840
Well, and here's the problem, too, is like you raise the price, you're going to raise the

1013
00:54:42,840 --> 00:54:44,240
expectations of that service.

1014
00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:49,040
A lot of people have been kind of letting them get letting it slide when it comes to poor

1015
00:54:49,040 --> 00:54:53,240
performance on this Nintendo online because, well, it's only 20 bucks a year, you know,

1016
00:54:53,240 --> 00:54:58,440
whatever, you know, but now that it's it's comparable to the other services now that level

1017
00:54:58,440 --> 00:55:00,160
of expectations can be higher, too.

1018
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:05,920
And I'm sorry, like, yeah, I get it that your Nintendo 64 games are pretty cool, but you

1019
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:10,920
know what, though, like I'm getting sixty dollar free games or games that were like, you

1020
00:55:10,920 --> 00:55:13,400
know, triple-A quality games that are recent.

1021
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:18,880
To a month, at least with these services, these other services I'm paying for, like.

1022
00:55:19,880 --> 00:55:25,600
You know how Nintendo has not shown that they can put out games on a consistent basis within

1023
00:55:25,600 --> 00:55:31,600
those online collections, it's just and it's really scraping the bottom of the barrel

1024
00:55:31,600 --> 00:55:32,320
sometimes of that.

1025
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,320
OK, yeah, Super Mario 64 is a great game.

1026
00:55:35,360 --> 00:55:36,040
Well, you know what?

1027
00:55:36,040 --> 00:55:41,480
You sold Super Mario 64, then you stop selling it on purpose so that you could then raise

1028
00:55:41,480 --> 00:55:42,400
the price on this.

1029
00:55:42,800 --> 00:55:45,520
Like, it's just it's absolutely stupid.

1030
00:55:45,520 --> 00:55:49,400
I'm just not interested in in ponying up for this new scheme, and I know I'm going to

1031
00:55:49,400 --> 00:55:53,560
regret it probably down the road, but like the reality is, well, I mean, I can always buy

1032
00:55:53,560 --> 00:55:55,760
it later, I guess there's nothing to make me get it right now.

1033
00:55:55,760 --> 00:55:58,560
Certainly there's nothing and maybe that's exactly what it is.

1034
00:55:58,600 --> 00:56:02,480
There's nothing motivating for me right now on October 25th to upgrade to this.

1035
00:56:02,520 --> 00:56:03,400
So I'm not going to.

1036
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:04,480
I'm not upgrading.

1037
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:07,960
And the only thing I'm doing is I'll buy the DLC, but that's it.

1038
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:12,480
I mean, I'm not going to upgrade, which is yeah, which is fine.

1039
00:56:13,480 --> 00:56:16,280
I'll do it if the person who manages our family plan does it.

1040
00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:23,600
And the other thing with all this, too, is that, you know, PlayStation Plus, Xbox Gold are

1041
00:56:23,600 --> 00:56:25,440
ten dollars more a year.

1042
00:56:25,680 --> 00:56:30,960
And what Xbox Gold gives four free games a month, PlayStation Plus two, at least three.

1043
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:33,480
And again, like you said, the sixty dollar games are being included with that.

1044
00:56:33,680 --> 00:56:36,480
And Nintendo's response is to give fucking happy home designer.

1045
00:56:36,800 --> 00:56:37,800
Sorry, Jamie.

1046
00:56:37,800 --> 00:56:42,160
But, you know, it's just it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's

1047
00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:44,560
you know, it's not enough for that.

1048
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,080
It's not enough for that type of fee.

1049
00:56:47,200 --> 00:56:49,560
And the 90s hang court right out regardless.

1050
00:56:49,800 --> 00:56:54,720
What if like like God forbid, like I know Animal Crossing is a popular game, but not

1051
00:56:54,720 --> 00:56:57,600
every single person that has a switch has Animal Crossing.

1052
00:56:57,840 --> 00:57:01,440
So let's just say like you don't play Animal Crossing because that's just not your cup

1053
00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:04,000
of tea. Maybe you're more of a smash player or something like that.

1054
00:57:04,360 --> 00:57:08,440
What is really like so you're really not getting a value proposition with that because

1055
00:57:08,440 --> 00:57:09,920
it's like, well, you know.

1056
00:57:11,120 --> 00:57:15,600
I still I'm not really getting anything I'm getting DLC, so hopefully they'll want me

1057
00:57:15,600 --> 00:57:20,720
to buy the game now so I can play with this DLC like I just don't I don't know, it's

1058
00:57:20,720 --> 00:57:26,160
such a tough sell because it's more than double the current price for Nintendo 64 games.

1059
00:57:26,200 --> 00:57:28,800
I'm sorry that like we've played them to death.

1060
00:57:28,800 --> 00:57:29,880
We've played them so many times.

1061
00:57:29,880 --> 00:57:33,120
We've bought them so many times through the Wii shops and stuff like that.

1062
00:57:33,400 --> 00:57:38,360
Like. Why can't I play my old games they purchase, you know, like I can still play old

1063
00:57:38,360 --> 00:57:43,880
Xbox 360, Xbox Live arcade games if they're supported on the Xbox one, I can still play

1064
00:57:43,880 --> 00:57:48,920
a lot of those. Like I just it's so stupid that you have to keep rebutting your stuff.

1065
00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:56,840
At the end of the day, Nintendo's counting on the hardcore to fund them, and I think

1066
00:57:56,840 --> 00:57:57,760
that's how it's going to go.

1067
00:57:58,400 --> 00:58:03,720
And I'm I'm going to just beg everybody to really ask yourself if this is worth it.

1068
00:58:03,720 --> 00:58:10,160
And look, I can understand that, yes, Mario Kart 64 online and Sin and Punishment and

1069
00:58:10,160 --> 00:58:11,960
all that is going to be worth it to some people.

1070
00:58:11,960 --> 00:58:16,520
If that's you go off, nobody nobody but you should get to dictate how your money is

1071
00:58:16,520 --> 00:58:21,960
spent. But for me, I'm very disappointed in this as a Nintendo fan and somebody who

1072
00:58:21,960 --> 00:58:24,360
usually defends them on this program.

1073
00:58:24,360 --> 00:58:28,200
I think it's so interesting because after that last direct, I was so hyped.

1074
00:58:28,200 --> 00:58:30,200
I'm like, that's the best direct Nintendo's ever done.

1075
00:58:30,200 --> 00:58:33,200
I'm so hyped. And then this happens and I'm like, wow.

1076
00:58:33,800 --> 00:58:36,480
Not to go back to Dead by Daylight, but I'm going to.

1077
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:40,720
And you know that opening movie where Dwight's running down the stairs and then he

1078
00:58:40,720 --> 00:58:43,640
trips on the stair and eat shit and then pinhead chains him to the wall.

1079
00:58:43,840 --> 00:58:46,080
That is how I'm feeling about Nintendo right now.

1080
00:58:46,080 --> 00:58:51,600
And here's the ironic thing about this whole thing is if they had just done this instead

1081
00:58:51,600 --> 00:58:56,120
of a subscription model like they're doing now and just opened up an e-shop where we

1082
00:58:56,120 --> 00:59:00,000
could just purchase these piecemeal, they would probably make more money than they're

1083
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:01,720
going to make off of these subscriptions.

1084
00:59:02,440 --> 00:59:06,280
Like it's funny, it's funny, and I already know Bobby's typing this comment in chat and

1085
00:59:06,280 --> 00:59:09,960
probably some other people, too, is that when when it was like that, then everybody asked

1086
00:59:09,960 --> 00:59:11,360
them to be the Netflix of gaming.

1087
00:59:11,600 --> 00:59:17,880
Here's here's the problem is that everybody's looking at it and now going Nintendo, you

1088
00:59:17,880 --> 00:59:21,960
have this gigantic fucking catalog and you're piecemealing it like this.

1089
00:59:21,960 --> 00:59:25,880
When people wanted Netflix for games, they didn't want.

1090
00:59:25,880 --> 00:59:35,000
These like small, they wanted your whole catalog, they want the game pass and that's

1091
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:35,680
that's what they wanted.

1092
00:59:35,680 --> 00:59:38,920
But then now that tells like, well, yeah, we could do that, but it's going to be fifty

1093
00:59:38,920 --> 00:59:40,120
dollars a year.

1094
00:59:41,440 --> 00:59:45,520
Which I think if they brought it down by month and like it may not be such a big deal,

1095
00:59:45,520 --> 00:59:51,760
but like it's still I don't know, it's just it's still very clunky, it's it really should

1096
00:59:51,760 --> 00:59:57,600
all be like like I shouldn't have to have separate apps for Nintendo, Super Nintendo,

1097
00:59:57,600 --> 00:59:59,360
Genesis, Nintendo 64.

1098
00:59:59,440 --> 01:00:02,400
It should just be one giant like collection.

1099
01:00:02,800 --> 01:00:04,120
That's how they should really do it.

1100
01:00:04,120 --> 01:00:08,760
And it should be also just like why isn't there Game Boy games yet?

1101
01:00:08,800 --> 01:00:13,280
Why isn't there like, you know, stuff that we know that they could like Game Boy, Game

1102
01:00:13,280 --> 01:00:16,360
Boy Advance, like they could do all this stuff easy.

1103
01:00:16,560 --> 01:00:18,440
It's the 3DS could do it.

1104
01:00:18,440 --> 01:00:19,240
Come on.

1105
01:00:19,240 --> 01:00:21,040
Like that's easy stuff.

1106
01:00:21,040 --> 01:00:22,720
Just put it out in there.

1107
01:00:22,720 --> 01:00:23,440
I don't.

1108
01:00:24,560 --> 01:00:26,280
That's probably next year, I guess.

1109
01:00:26,800 --> 01:00:31,840
Pixel Pacas in chat says, I love N64 and still have a console plus games, but still wanted

1110
01:00:31,840 --> 01:00:35,760
to opt into this for very quick and easy access to key N64 games.

1111
01:00:36,040 --> 01:00:38,920
But I won't be upgrading my online membership at this price point.

1112
01:00:39,320 --> 01:00:41,920
ZenMonkey11 in chat says Nintendo knows what they're doing.

1113
01:00:41,920 --> 01:00:43,800
They like to do things right and thorough.

1114
01:00:44,160 --> 01:00:47,720
All I'm going to say is that the Wii U called and said hello.

1115
01:00:47,720 --> 01:00:49,840
The Wii Vitality sensor called and said hello.

1116
01:00:50,160 --> 01:00:54,360
Look, Nintendo is the best game maker in the business that I'm not never going to argue

1117
01:00:54,360 --> 01:00:57,240
that point, but they don't always make winning decisions.

1118
01:00:57,240 --> 01:00:58,720
And in my opinion, this is one of them.

1119
01:00:58,720 --> 01:01:00,280
That's not a winning decision.

1120
01:01:00,280 --> 01:01:01,240
And that's my opinion.

1121
01:01:02,720 --> 01:01:05,200
Here's one of the thing that I want to say on this whole thing before we get to the next

1122
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:08,680
story, and that is that whole and I'm sure you guys have seen this, that whole, quote

1123
01:01:08,680 --> 01:01:09,480
unquote, rumor.

1124
01:01:09,480 --> 01:01:13,440
But it comes from that source that's gotten a lot of Nintendo things right before.

1125
01:01:13,600 --> 01:01:15,560
So Nintendo is more apt to believe her.

1126
01:01:15,720 --> 01:01:21,560
And the whole thing that it's apparently the third party licensing that is driving this

1127
01:01:21,560 --> 01:01:22,560
cost so high.

1128
01:01:22,560 --> 01:01:26,640
So namely, Sega Genesis is what's driving this cost so high.

1129
01:01:26,800 --> 01:01:28,440
And I'm sitting here going.

1130
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:36,480
That that is that makes a bad thing even worse, they paid that much for Sega Genesis

1131
01:01:36,480 --> 01:01:39,600
stuff, and I'm not knocking the Genesis.

1132
01:01:39,800 --> 01:01:41,160
It's an important console.

1133
01:01:41,160 --> 01:01:42,160
It's a great thing.

1134
01:01:42,880 --> 01:01:44,320
It's everywhere else.

1135
01:01:45,960 --> 01:01:50,960
Except the Wii U, which this rumor said Sega didn't play up on the Wii U because they

1136
01:01:50,960 --> 01:01:55,960
were disappointed in what little sales there were on the Wii and that it wasn't really

1137
01:01:55,960 --> 01:01:57,800
advertised and backed very well.

1138
01:01:58,040 --> 01:02:02,880
But I'm sorry, we all know of that Genesis collection that's available on every other

1139
01:02:02,880 --> 01:02:03,560
platform.

1140
01:02:03,680 --> 01:02:09,080
We know that Sega has no problem releasing their back catalog on like Steam and all

1141
01:02:09,080 --> 01:02:10,280
sorts of other places.

1142
01:02:10,440 --> 01:02:12,840
Those games, very easy to come by.

1143
01:02:12,920 --> 01:02:16,880
I mean, I guess you could even Castlevania Bloodlines was in that Castlevania collection.

1144
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:18,120
They just did not that long ago.

1145
01:02:18,120 --> 01:02:18,960
What's what's left?

1146
01:02:19,080 --> 01:02:20,000
Contra hardcore?

1147
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:21,440
That was in the Contra collection.

1148
01:02:21,560 --> 01:02:22,280
What's left?

1149
01:02:22,640 --> 01:02:28,200
Like there's maybe one or two Genesis games in there that aren't really easily accessible

1150
01:02:28,200 --> 01:02:28,800
somewhere else.

1151
01:02:29,240 --> 01:02:35,280
And so whoever if that is true and it's a big if and I understand this person's gotten

1152
01:02:35,280 --> 01:02:37,760
a lot right before, but I bet they've gotten along wrong, too.

1153
01:02:37,760 --> 01:02:45,200
If this is true, that was that was the worst call in the whole thing.

1154
01:02:45,960 --> 01:02:51,360
Who thought that was a good idea to drive the cost up that high to get the Sega fucking

1155
01:02:51,360 --> 01:02:56,560
Genesis on the Switch when it is literally everywhere else?

1156
01:02:57,240 --> 01:02:58,960
They could have polled people, too.

1157
01:02:58,960 --> 01:03:00,400
I mean, there also is that.

1158
01:03:03,360 --> 01:03:07,160
Yeah, I guess I but again, I don't understand why that and why not.

1159
01:03:07,360 --> 01:03:08,280
Oh, I don't know.

1160
01:03:08,480 --> 01:03:12,400
Do a Gameboy color that has the Pokemon games in it.

1161
01:03:12,640 --> 01:03:17,480
Jesus, that that a lot like if it's just like all the old school Pokemon games.

1162
01:03:18,200 --> 01:03:18,880
Oh, my God.

1163
01:03:18,880 --> 01:03:21,840
People would people would have paid the higher fee for just that.

1164
01:03:24,600 --> 01:03:28,720
Shane, no, I'm just kidding, other people, especially if it had the Pokemon bank

1165
01:03:28,720 --> 01:03:30,240
functionality, you know.

1166
01:03:32,400 --> 01:03:35,000
Johnny Woo face says would rather had GameCube over Genesis.

1167
01:03:35,520 --> 01:03:38,720
As you know, Matt says there are like 10 different Sega collections with those games

1168
01:03:38,720 --> 01:03:39,880
out there. Exactly.

1169
01:03:40,080 --> 01:03:42,200
So, again, that is a rumor.

1170
01:03:42,200 --> 01:03:46,840
I don't want to say like that is the way it is, but it's coming from a source that's been

1171
01:03:46,840 --> 01:03:49,160
right before. So people are really paying attention to it.

1172
01:03:50,120 --> 01:03:55,840
And as I say, if that is true, somebody at Nintendo should be having their job examined

1173
01:03:55,840 --> 01:04:00,080
this week. Quite frankly, that that was the worst business decision somebody could have

1174
01:04:00,080 --> 01:04:06,560
possibly made that it shows a complete lack of awareness of what is happening in the

1175
01:04:06,560 --> 01:04:13,200
industry. If you're Sega, somebody should get a promotion over at Sega for making that

1176
01:04:13,200 --> 01:04:16,880
deal. So because you fucking took him to the cleaners.

1177
01:04:16,920 --> 01:04:23,880
Good job. Once again, Sega ahead of the curve and ahead of its time.

1178
01:04:25,520 --> 01:04:27,920
All right, let's move on.

1179
01:04:30,320 --> 01:04:33,640
Mike Deff says a co-host of mine said they should have just bought Saturn games since a

1180
01:04:33,640 --> 01:04:35,320
lot of people miss those. Yes.

1181
01:04:35,480 --> 01:04:39,960
Yeah. Or if it had been the Dreamcast, can you fucking imagine people would have lost

1182
01:04:39,960 --> 01:04:45,360
their shit? So if if that's the long term plan with Sega.

1183
01:04:46,640 --> 01:04:51,240
Then I will eat my words and I'm not going to say I'm going to eat my hat or something

1184
01:04:51,240 --> 01:04:55,800
because I'll have to chow down on it eventually, possibly, but I will eat my words and

1185
01:04:55,800 --> 01:04:57,160
pony up for one of these subscriptions.

1186
01:04:57,200 --> 01:05:03,000
Absolutely. If that's the long term plan, then that person at Nintendo can keep their

1187
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:04,600
job because that's a very smart plan.

1188
01:05:04,800 --> 01:05:07,600
But if Genesis is the only thing that was in the plan, that was stupid.

1189
01:05:07,960 --> 01:05:13,280
But if the plan involves Dreamcast in six months time or something, Saturn, then OK,

1190
01:05:13,320 --> 01:05:14,400
good job. You did it.

1191
01:05:14,640 --> 01:05:18,120
You did the thing. You probably should have dropped a hint around now to get people more

1192
01:05:18,120 --> 01:05:19,800
excited. But whatever, whatever.

1193
01:05:20,560 --> 01:05:22,920
All right, let's move on. We're running behind us.

1194
01:05:22,920 --> 01:05:25,120
It is. So I want to get to the next story, which is Loki's.

1195
01:05:26,120 --> 01:05:29,720
So we talked about how there's been all these rumors about the Grand Theft Auto trilogy.

1196
01:05:29,760 --> 01:05:33,840
Well, it's even more I mean, they've officially announced that it is coming, but we still

1197
01:05:33,840 --> 01:05:35,920
don't know exactly what exactly it is.

1198
01:05:36,120 --> 01:05:42,480
However, there's been things found on Deep Within Rockstar's website that kind of it's a

1199
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:46,680
description of it. So they basically said three iconic cities, three epic stories.

1200
01:05:46,880 --> 01:05:53,040
It's going to have the higher resolution textures increase, draw distance, environmental

1201
01:05:53,080 --> 01:05:59,600
upgrades, Grand Theft Auto five style controls and targeting, which is definitely a huge

1202
01:05:59,680 --> 01:06:03,520
upgrade from what was available on the PlayStation one eras.

1203
01:06:04,880 --> 01:06:07,840
All right. Yeah, back when those games originally came out.

1204
01:06:09,560 --> 01:06:11,160
So it sounds interesting.

1205
01:06:11,160 --> 01:06:16,760
I don't know necessarily when it's coming out yet, but apparently there's going to be

1206
01:06:16,760 --> 01:06:20,240
some sort of ten dollar discount or something.

1207
01:06:20,240 --> 01:06:24,440
If you buy it, you get a discount on other rockstar games or something like that.

1208
01:06:24,760 --> 01:06:29,200
So probably later on this year, we'll have to see what exactly it is.

1209
01:06:29,840 --> 01:06:32,160
I'm keeping my expectations low, though.

1210
01:06:34,520 --> 01:06:36,000
As the Grand Theft Auto fan.

1211
01:06:37,640 --> 01:06:38,880
Yeah, well.

1212
01:06:40,240 --> 01:06:44,080
I don't know, I played those so many times, though, I played San Andreas and three and

1213
01:06:44,080 --> 01:06:45,680
Vice City so many times.

1214
01:06:45,680 --> 01:06:48,840
I get it, I get it, but it's just like I can't imagine.

1215
01:06:49,840 --> 01:06:52,960
It's going to be that great, but whatever, we'll check it out.

1216
01:06:54,080 --> 01:06:58,840
All right, speaking of things I can't imagine are going to be that great, let's talk about

1217
01:06:58,840 --> 01:07:01,240
the return of G4 to television.

1218
01:07:01,480 --> 01:07:08,440
So finally, after all this time, we have found out that G4 will be returning to cable

1219
01:07:08,440 --> 01:07:13,040
television. It is not as I thought it was going to be something that was going to be

1220
01:07:13,040 --> 01:07:16,400
leveraged for the Peacock service, which would have made a lot of sense.

1221
01:07:16,640 --> 01:07:18,480
But they are going back to traditional cable.

1222
01:07:18,480 --> 01:07:19,840
So, hey, I mean, congrats.

1223
01:07:19,840 --> 01:07:26,600
That's a win. It is going to launch November 16th on Xfinity TV, Cox and Verizon Fios.

1224
01:07:27,280 --> 01:07:31,560
So that's interesting. You can also stream the network on Filo as well.

1225
01:07:32,400 --> 01:07:36,560
G4 has supposedly made some type of promotional and commercial deal with Twitch.

1226
01:07:37,040 --> 01:07:40,200
I'm assuming that means you're going to see a lot of G4 ads as the pre-roll into other

1227
01:07:40,200 --> 01:07:45,560
content. And G4 will continue to make dedicated social content for social media

1228
01:07:45,560 --> 01:07:48,600
channels that will include YouTube as well.

1229
01:07:48,760 --> 01:07:52,160
So they put out a whole little teaser this week that finally showed the date.

1230
01:07:52,880 --> 01:07:55,160
Attack of the Show and X-Play are returning.

1231
01:07:55,160 --> 01:07:59,320
Kevin Pereira and Adam Sessler are going to be hosting those respective shows.

1232
01:07:59,800 --> 01:08:02,600
No words on other hosts and their involvement right now.

1233
01:08:04,160 --> 01:08:06,360
ESL Esports events will be there as well.

1234
01:08:06,920 --> 01:08:11,720
Dungeons and Dragons playthrough with G4 talent and other celebs, I guess, will be

1235
01:08:11,720 --> 01:08:16,840
there, too. And oh, boy, all 167 episodes of Ninja Warrior for those.

1236
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:23,080
So this is very much late G4 coming back and not early G4 that many of us liked.

1237
01:08:23,720 --> 01:08:25,440
I'll just get XAV instead.

1238
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:26,760
Is it too late?

1239
01:08:28,200 --> 01:08:32,760
Some of the other talent coming to G4, Alex Goldenboy Mendez.

1240
01:08:33,880 --> 01:08:36,640
Avilimay, I've never heard of any of these people.

1241
01:08:37,160 --> 01:08:42,040
Indiana Froskrin Black, YouTube creators Kasim G.

1242
01:08:42,040 --> 01:08:45,920
Gerard, The Completionist Khalil and Gina Darling.

1243
01:08:46,400 --> 01:08:52,880
Twitch streamers Fiona Nova and Will Neff and WWE Xavier Woods, aka Austin Creed.

1244
01:08:52,880 --> 01:08:53,920
OK, I've heard of that one.

1245
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,200
The rest I've heard of the wrestler.

1246
01:08:56,200 --> 01:08:59,960
I can't fucking believe we're here at this point, but OK, I guess this is where I'm

1247
01:08:59,960 --> 01:09:03,360
just old, out of touch grandpa of Bahmani Boomer.

1248
01:09:03,360 --> 01:09:05,080
I forgot we all got titles last week.

1249
01:09:05,280 --> 01:09:10,080
Old, out of touch Bahmani Boomer, who doesn't know any of these other new names.

1250
01:09:10,440 --> 01:09:13,440
So anyway, G4 is coming back.

1251
01:09:14,280 --> 01:09:17,240
Anyone have anything to say, anything to say about that?

1252
01:09:19,200 --> 01:09:20,520
I'll wave a little flag.

1253
01:09:21,960 --> 01:09:27,040
I'm going to surprise that they don't go like I get it because it's a cable, like a

1254
01:09:27,040 --> 01:09:30,200
cable channel and they want you to subscribe to it, which I won't be doing.

1255
01:09:31,200 --> 01:09:36,200
But I am kind of disappointed that they're not within this century and streaming online

1256
01:09:36,200 --> 01:09:39,880
as well, like on like Twitch or something like that.

1257
01:09:40,320 --> 01:09:43,160
But whatever, I guess.

1258
01:09:45,320 --> 01:09:47,920
Let's see, Mike Deft says, I do follow The Completionist.

1259
01:09:47,920 --> 01:09:49,160
Good guy. All right. I trust you.

1260
01:09:49,160 --> 01:09:50,360
I trust your feedback, Mike Deft.

1261
01:09:51,080 --> 01:09:53,160
Let's see. Critical Myth says, this sounds terrible.

1262
01:09:53,160 --> 01:09:58,800
Yeah, I mean, I will continue to not watch it like every other cable network.

1263
01:09:58,800 --> 01:10:00,120
I don't watch cable TV anymore.

1264
01:10:00,200 --> 01:10:03,560
This little thing called Twitch came along and I can watch my friends play video games

1265
01:10:03,560 --> 01:10:05,760
and talk to them and chat and be a little bit social.

1266
01:10:05,760 --> 01:10:07,440
And that's kind of what I do.

1267
01:10:07,560 --> 01:10:10,000
And in my opinion, that's G4's biggest competitor.

1268
01:10:10,120 --> 01:10:12,680
So I guess they're smart to team up with Twitch a little bit.

1269
01:10:12,680 --> 01:10:17,480
But yeah, Bobby Black Wolf says, but are they streaming like they're on traditional

1270
01:10:17,480 --> 01:10:18,760
cable in a streaming service?

1271
01:10:18,960 --> 01:10:20,600
It's just not a streaming service you have.

1272
01:10:20,600 --> 01:10:22,120
It's on that Phylos or whatever.

1273
01:10:22,120 --> 01:10:23,800
So cool.

1274
01:10:23,800 --> 01:10:27,720
Yeah, Phylo you can do like through like smart TV and stuff.

1275
01:10:27,720 --> 01:10:32,600
I've watched a little bit of the Hell's Kitchen uncensored channel.

1276
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:35,680
I watched a lot of the RuPaul's Drag Race channel and that was a thing.

1277
01:10:35,680 --> 01:10:36,640
But they got rid of that.

1278
01:10:36,880 --> 01:10:39,800
And then I watched some of the Survivor channel that shows that the old ass episode

1279
01:10:39,800 --> 01:10:41,160
survivor on Pluto TV.

1280
01:10:41,400 --> 01:10:45,280
That's about that's about the most channel stuff I've watched on those free streaming

1281
01:10:45,280 --> 01:10:47,040
services. Oh, I take that back.

1282
01:10:47,600 --> 01:10:52,000
My TV has something built into it.

1283
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:53,720
What's Samsung's streaming service?

1284
01:10:53,920 --> 01:10:56,800
The Samsung TVs have something built into it and they have a game show channel.

1285
01:10:56,800 --> 01:10:57,800
And I do watch that.

1286
01:10:58,520 --> 01:11:00,560
I forgot about that. So I will I'll give you that.

1287
01:11:01,160 --> 01:11:04,480
Pluto's fun when they've got because they have the dedicated Mr.

1288
01:11:04,480 --> 01:11:06,880
Sans here, three thousand channels, which are always fun.

1289
01:11:09,080 --> 01:11:11,640
OK, Mike Deff says smart TV, I have it too, so.

1290
01:11:11,640 --> 01:11:14,560
All right. Anyway, let's move on.

1291
01:11:14,560 --> 01:11:16,520
I think we're to Dark Sakura.

1292
01:11:17,440 --> 01:11:26,720
Are we? Well, you know, I am a big fan of of the analog company and a lot of the

1293
01:11:27,040 --> 01:11:30,840
things that they put out and I really do want one of these just they're expensive.

1294
01:11:31,920 --> 01:11:36,800
The analog pocket that's supposed to play all these delightful things.

1295
01:11:37,640 --> 01:11:42,440
It's getting its own operating system when it launches and it is going to launch later

1296
01:11:42,440 --> 01:11:48,880
this year. Now, tell me when the freakin' analog duo is coming up, because that's what

1297
01:11:48,880 --> 01:11:50,960
I want more. Anyway.

1298
01:11:51,640 --> 01:12:01,160
They are going to come out with analog OS, which they call, quote, a definitive

1299
01:12:01,160 --> 01:12:07,840
scholarly operating system that lets users explore, discover and play through all of

1300
01:12:07,840 --> 01:12:09,120
video game history.

1301
01:12:09,760 --> 01:12:16,520
It is a fairly minimalist operating system to which I'm rather pleased about, but it

1302
01:12:16,520 --> 01:12:23,240
has its library that has a database that was built by the group at Analog that shows

1303
01:12:23,240 --> 01:12:28,920
a system by system, game by game, region by region, developer by developer, publisher

1304
01:12:28,920 --> 01:12:36,000
by publisher, revision by revision, a complete and total history of video games.

1305
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:43,680
And that, I have to say, it's it's gorgeous.

1306
01:12:44,400 --> 01:12:49,440
I like it. And on top of that, I mean, some of the other things, too, is that you can

1307
01:12:49,440 --> 01:12:53,960
organize your your games and create gaming playlists.

1308
01:12:55,920 --> 01:12:58,440
That and you can share your playlist with other people.

1309
01:12:59,440 --> 01:13:05,760
And you can track when you play, it's got like all kinds of other other interesting

1310
01:13:05,760 --> 01:13:17,360
tools in it with a nice OLED display, but that the OS is it looks really, really beautiful.

1311
01:13:17,640 --> 01:13:25,480
You know me, I like something that's clean looking that that's just simple and easy to

1312
01:13:25,960 --> 01:13:31,840
pick up. But the fact that it's got so much gaming history attached to it is honestly

1313
01:13:31,840 --> 01:13:34,600
it's what I really, really am excited for.

1314
01:13:35,320 --> 01:13:38,400
I, I more and more want one of these things.

1315
01:13:40,760 --> 01:13:47,240
Plus, it has dark mode and you have like classic screen modes and all kinds of different

1316
01:13:47,240 --> 01:13:51,360
features for the different systems that are portrayed in the gaming.

1317
01:13:51,360 --> 01:13:54,960
And I'm absolutely delighted by this.

1318
01:13:57,080 --> 01:14:01,480
Yeah, it looks really neat, like I kind of want to get one of these, too, just because it

1319
01:14:01,480 --> 01:14:03,520
looks like such a great way to kind of play the old games.

1320
01:14:03,760 --> 01:14:08,280
They have a very strong kind of like anti ROM stance, too, like they're very much like

1321
01:14:08,280 --> 01:14:10,200
this is for cartridges, not for ROM.

1322
01:14:10,200 --> 01:14:15,160
Well, I think they're just saying that the the they're just trying to clarify that the OS

1323
01:14:15,160 --> 01:14:16,920
is not allowing you to pirate stuff.

1324
01:14:17,480 --> 01:14:20,520
The system is meant to be like a physical, you know.

1325
01:14:22,080 --> 01:14:25,880
Physical game device, but like the fact that it plays HuCards.

1326
01:14:27,400 --> 01:14:30,000
And I think it plays both varieties of HuCards.

1327
01:14:31,320 --> 01:14:34,880
I mean, my Turbo Express is kind of beat.

1328
01:14:35,120 --> 01:14:38,480
It would be nice to to have something like this.

1329
01:14:38,680 --> 01:14:42,800
Yeah. Plus, you could always get like a never drive or something like that if you

1330
01:14:42,800 --> 01:14:44,280
wanted to load your own ROMs and.

1331
01:14:45,120 --> 01:14:46,520
Yeah.

1332
01:14:47,480 --> 01:14:50,960
All right, well, moving on a few more stories here before we get to the classic game of

1333
01:14:50,960 --> 01:14:51,880
the week, but first.

1334
01:14:53,120 --> 01:14:53,520
Loki.

1335
01:14:55,400 --> 01:15:01,760
So Epic has finally admitted what we've already all known since the absolute beginning of

1336
01:15:01,760 --> 01:15:09,720
time that, yes, Fortnite's imposter mode might have been inspired by Among Us.

1337
01:15:09,720 --> 01:15:12,880
It may have been, you know, a little bit.

1338
01:15:14,280 --> 01:15:21,760
So, yeah, basically said that, you know, in their, I guess, update notes or whatever,

1339
01:15:21,760 --> 01:15:28,480
they said, you know, version 18.20 brings improvements to imposters, the game mode

1340
01:15:28,480 --> 01:15:31,240
inspired by Among Us from Intersloth.

1341
01:15:32,360 --> 01:15:35,400
So they do mention that, you know, they finally do credit them.

1342
01:15:35,760 --> 01:15:40,160
Of course, you know, Intersloth said, you know, hey, we didn't really necessarily we

1343
01:15:40,160 --> 01:15:44,160
didn't patent the mechanics for Among Us because they don't think it's healthy for the

1344
01:15:44,160 --> 01:15:45,640
game industry to do that.

1345
01:15:46,960 --> 01:15:51,280
And I think the thought is that there's going to be some sort of maybe crossover between

1346
01:15:51,280 --> 01:15:55,800
Among Us and Fortnite that they're going to do something with that maybe.

1347
01:15:55,840 --> 01:15:59,600
And that's why now they're kind of shaking hands and, you know.

1348
01:16:01,080 --> 01:16:06,720
So among us team, don't sell out, don't do it, don't.

1349
01:16:08,560 --> 01:16:13,360
So we'll see, but thank you, Epic, for doing the bare minimum.

1350
01:16:15,160 --> 01:16:18,720
I think you're right, right, though, that it could be leading to something bigger, but

1351
01:16:18,720 --> 01:16:19,200
we'll see.

1352
01:16:19,920 --> 01:16:20,360
All right.

1353
01:16:20,360 --> 01:16:21,840
I mean, yeah, it's.

1354
01:16:24,840 --> 01:16:29,040
Well, moving on to before we get to the classic game of the week, obviously, a lot of

1355
01:16:29,040 --> 01:16:34,920
people loving Metroid Dread, but don't run into the bug that is in the game that apparently

1356
01:16:34,920 --> 01:16:39,120
is really screwing people up on being able to finish the game because the title will

1357
01:16:39,120 --> 01:16:43,040
close out and causes an error that says the software was closed because an error

1358
01:16:43,080 --> 01:16:48,600
occurred. Apparently, if you destroy a door while a map marker for that door is displayed

1359
01:16:48,600 --> 01:16:51,640
on the map, it will crash the game, which seems a little silly.

1360
01:16:52,160 --> 01:16:58,320
Nintendo says if you just restart and before this happens, take off the icon door map

1361
01:16:58,320 --> 01:17:01,640
marker and then the error won't occur and the game can continue.

1362
01:17:02,280 --> 01:17:03,920
So that seems easy enough to avoid.

1363
01:17:03,920 --> 01:17:06,520
But Nintendo will be patching the game.

1364
01:17:06,880 --> 01:17:10,560
You don't often hear about Nintendo having to do bug fix patches because they come from

1365
01:17:10,560 --> 01:17:12,160
an era when you couldn't do that.

1366
01:17:12,400 --> 01:17:14,720
So but that they're doing it.

1367
01:17:14,720 --> 01:17:16,120
So they're going to it isn't the first time.

1368
01:17:16,120 --> 01:17:19,680
Obviously, we just talked about an Animal Crossing patch, so they're going to fix this

1369
01:17:19,680 --> 01:17:23,800
with a patch. And I think it's supposed to be a little later this month.

1370
01:17:23,800 --> 01:17:26,000
I think I was hearing is when they were planning to put that out.

1371
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:29,120
So that'll be good for people trying to get past that.

1372
01:17:29,120 --> 01:17:35,760
But it is very interesting that the game launched with a bug kind of like that, that left

1373
01:17:35,760 --> 01:17:38,680
some folks getting their games restarted on them, which would have.

1374
01:17:38,680 --> 01:17:43,960
It would have made me unhappy if I ran into that, I guess I still could, but I haven't

1375
01:17:43,960 --> 01:17:46,280
really been using map markers, so I probably won't.

1376
01:17:47,200 --> 01:17:51,120
All right, I'm going to our chat before we get to our next segment.

1377
01:17:51,360 --> 01:17:54,280
Zen Monkey in chat says the Among Us team already sold out.

1378
01:17:54,280 --> 01:17:58,680
They promised an Among Us 2 and Among Us 1 going totally free and open source.

1379
01:17:58,880 --> 01:18:01,000
Then they saw how popular the first one got.

1380
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:03,320
So they saw dollar signs and changed their roadmap.

1381
01:18:03,840 --> 01:18:10,360
Um, I kind of see that, but at the same time, there's a part of me that thinks that sort of

1382
01:18:10,360 --> 01:18:12,320
success, they they kind of earned it.

1383
01:18:12,320 --> 01:18:14,280
They made a cultural phenomenon type of thing.

1384
01:18:14,440 --> 01:18:17,320
I get the hold they were going to make it open source and then they didn't.

1385
01:18:17,320 --> 01:18:19,280
Kind of seems as them going back on their word.

1386
01:18:19,600 --> 01:18:25,080
I would guess one day this game will lose its popularity and steam and all that stuff.

1387
01:18:25,360 --> 01:18:29,240
And they'll probably come around and release the source code like they did with Doom, like

1388
01:18:29,400 --> 01:18:34,880
all the stuff to probably like depending on the success of it, because obviously like a

1389
01:18:34,880 --> 01:18:38,280
smaller game or something like that, they probably have no problem with like, they're

1390
01:18:38,280 --> 01:18:40,160
like, OK, well, we released it.

1391
01:18:40,680 --> 01:18:42,080
All right. Didn't really do that.

1392
01:18:42,080 --> 01:18:45,120
Great. OK, we'll go ahead and release the source code because why not?

1393
01:18:45,120 --> 01:18:47,720
We'll move on from there. And then it became a huge phenomenon.

1394
01:18:47,720 --> 01:18:51,400
They're like. All right, well, now we have to go a different approach.

1395
01:18:51,400 --> 01:18:52,480
I could see that.

1396
01:18:52,720 --> 01:18:54,920
Yeah, people can change their minds.

1397
01:18:55,920 --> 01:18:59,440
And Mike Deaf says, who's buying their official Among Us costume for Halloween?

1398
01:19:00,440 --> 01:19:05,240
I don't think they did not have any Among Us Halloween costumes when I went.

1399
01:19:05,240 --> 01:19:07,000
I haven't seen it, but I'm sure it's out there.

1400
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:13,240
Now, if you want Fortnite costumes, well, there's a whole section in the store for Fortnite.

1401
01:19:14,680 --> 01:19:16,920
All right. Can I be sexy Fortnite?

1402
01:19:17,880 --> 01:19:20,840
Because that's that's a Halloween is it's sexy.

1403
01:19:21,240 --> 01:19:26,160
Probably. I am I'm guessing I mean, ironically, yes, I think you can.

1404
01:19:26,160 --> 01:19:31,600
And I swear that I have seen those like kind of posts where it's showing the stupidest

1405
01:19:31,600 --> 01:19:33,560
like sexy costumes that they have.

1406
01:19:33,560 --> 01:19:39,640
And I'm pretty sure I did see one with like the llama pinata thing as like a sexy costume.

1407
01:19:39,640 --> 01:19:44,520
So it was just like it's blue and purple bikinis and a llama head.

1408
01:19:44,520 --> 01:19:45,640
It makes no sense.

1409
01:19:46,600 --> 01:19:49,480
E3 Vielenchat says squid game costume this year.

1410
01:19:49,480 --> 01:19:53,240
But that's a sexy did not have those sexy squid game.

1411
01:19:53,240 --> 01:19:58,960
I'm into it. It's too soon for like the Halloween store chains to actually have those

1412
01:19:58,960 --> 01:20:01,200
because they manufacture the stuff way in advance.

1413
01:20:02,200 --> 01:20:05,120
So they did not get in on the squid game stuff this year.

1414
01:20:05,120 --> 01:20:07,960
Now, Amazon and all the other like shops online.

1415
01:20:08,160 --> 01:20:09,360
Yeah, of course, you can do that.

1416
01:20:10,360 --> 01:20:13,960
I'm going to do that. I'm going to do that in Rocky for Rocky in two weeks.

1417
01:20:13,960 --> 01:20:15,400
I'm going to do sexy squid game.

1418
01:20:17,480 --> 01:20:19,080
I can't wait. All right.

1419
01:20:19,560 --> 01:20:21,400
Anyhow, let's move on.

1420
01:20:21,400 --> 01:20:24,160
Are you are you going to dress up like the doll?

1421
01:20:24,160 --> 01:20:25,400
I already know. I already know how to.

1422
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:27,200
I could dress up as the doll.

1423
01:20:27,200 --> 01:20:28,680
That's one way to do it. But I think what to do.

1424
01:20:28,680 --> 01:20:34,000
I'll wear for the top up like a tank top with the number like on it in green and then the

1425
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:38,600
bottom. I'm just going to have like probably I'll just wear like green undies that come up

1426
01:20:38,600 --> 01:20:43,400
pretty high. Like it's you know, I'm willing to wear it on the Rocky stage, but not much

1427
01:20:43,400 --> 01:20:46,360
beyond that, that and then like green fishnets and green heels.

1428
01:20:47,400 --> 01:20:49,360
That's that's my idea for sexy squid game.

1429
01:20:49,560 --> 01:20:54,520
So and then then what I'll do is I'll actually like I'll have a squid for one of my arms and

1430
01:20:54,520 --> 01:20:56,760
I'll make jokes about the tentacles.

1431
01:20:56,760 --> 01:20:57,800
Anyway. All right.

1432
01:20:58,720 --> 01:21:01,480
Tyre class says, what if you dress up as the squid kids from Splatoon?

1433
01:21:01,680 --> 01:21:05,920
I don't want to bring things for kids into these costume crazy costume ideas I have.

1434
01:21:06,040 --> 01:21:07,960
So pass pretty.

1435
01:21:07,960 --> 01:21:13,240
Yeah. Bonds 006 says, Rob, my girlfriend asked if you will do sexy squid game costume on

1436
01:21:13,240 --> 01:21:18,240
the podcast. Oh, this this is where we I should I should hold it hostage for money.

1437
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:20,680
We'll see. We'll see what kind of mood I mean.

1438
01:21:20,800 --> 01:21:24,480
Here's the thing. There are rules of what you can and can't do on Twitch.

1439
01:21:24,880 --> 01:21:28,480
So I will probably only be able to do it from the top up on Twitch.

1440
01:21:28,480 --> 01:21:30,040
You can't do that on Twitch a vision.

1441
01:21:30,080 --> 01:21:32,080
Yeah, you can't do that on Twitch a vision.

1442
01:21:33,560 --> 01:21:39,840
All right. Let's move on to a time when things were less sexy for Halloween.

1443
01:21:41,720 --> 01:21:43,640
These are pretty bad and homemade.

1444
01:21:49,240 --> 01:21:58,200
And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time or I'll dive into the vault and pull

1445
01:21:58,200 --> 01:22:00,080
out a classic and tell you about it.

1446
01:22:00,480 --> 01:22:03,200
It's time for the classic game of the week.

1447
01:22:04,640 --> 01:22:08,040
As Joe 100 Matt says, there was a time before sexy Halloween costumes.

1448
01:22:08,040 --> 01:22:11,120
I think so. At least there was a time when this game existed.

1449
01:22:11,120 --> 01:22:13,120
And it's it's not that sexy.

1450
01:22:13,120 --> 01:22:14,960
It's kind of loud. It's older than a lot of you.

1451
01:22:15,040 --> 01:22:17,440
Yes. Darcacro, what is this game that we're looking at?

1452
01:22:18,280 --> 01:22:21,520
The game that I picked is Monaco GP.

1453
01:22:21,920 --> 01:22:23,680
Now I'm going to take a step back.

1454
01:22:23,680 --> 01:22:28,800
A lot of people know Monaco GP as a more modern racer, but not so.

1455
01:22:28,800 --> 01:22:30,920
This is the original Monaco GP.

1456
01:22:33,040 --> 01:22:40,240
It is an arcade racing game that was released by Sega in November 1979 and came out in

1457
01:22:40,240 --> 01:22:42,720
North America, January 1980.

1458
01:22:43,520 --> 01:22:54,760
It has a very specific, special thing about it, and that is that it was the last Sega

1459
01:22:54,760 --> 01:23:04,840
game to use TTL based logic circuits instead of microprocessor based CPUs, transistor to

1460
01:23:04,840 --> 01:23:06,200
transistor logic, by the way.

1461
01:23:06,880 --> 01:23:20,760
It has 100 chips across two circuit boards, sprites and different images are are stored

1462
01:23:20,760 --> 01:23:27,440
on a small ROM chip, and then the sound effects and other things are stored.

1463
01:23:27,920 --> 01:23:32,560
They're actually generated by an operational amplifier and other analog circuitry.

1464
01:23:33,080 --> 01:23:40,840
So the scoring is done via LEDs on the cabinet, kind of old school pinball style,

1465
01:23:41,240 --> 01:23:44,280
including players high scores in the high score table.

1466
01:23:44,560 --> 01:23:50,040
And basically it's a race against the clock.

1467
01:23:50,040 --> 01:23:53,800
You are racing your little cars through five different areas.

1468
01:23:54,560 --> 01:23:57,160
You have rival cars that will get faster.

1469
01:23:57,160 --> 01:23:58,280
The road will narrow.

1470
01:23:58,280 --> 01:24:01,080
The surface changes to ice and gravel.

1471
01:24:02,880 --> 01:24:09,400
There are also for this arcade game, there were multiple cabinets out.

1472
01:24:09,760 --> 01:24:15,520
There was a deluxe cockpit cabinet that you would sit behind the steering wheel.

1473
01:24:15,520 --> 01:24:18,160
We had these a long time ago, y'all.

1474
01:24:19,320 --> 01:24:23,040
And then you also, of course, had the stand up versions.

1475
01:24:23,040 --> 01:24:37,920
But yeah, Monaco GP has had many a port and it really did sort of get that racing genre really big.

1476
01:24:37,920 --> 01:24:44,080
I mean, we also had around the same time, you know, pole positions coming out.

1477
01:24:44,080 --> 01:24:51,840
We had other racing games and this one was among the top three highest grossing

1478
01:24:51,840 --> 01:24:57,160
driving games of 1979 in Japan and the top five in 1980.

1479
01:24:57,520 --> 01:25:02,560
And in America, it was the top grossing driving game of 1981.

1480
01:25:02,560 --> 01:25:05,880
And it still remained in the Japanese charts through 83.

1481
01:25:07,040 --> 01:25:09,440
In the US, it remained in charts through 87.

1482
01:25:09,440 --> 01:25:10,920
So, I mean, look at that.

1483
01:25:10,920 --> 01:25:12,720
It's really, yeah.

1484
01:25:14,240 --> 01:25:18,720
And it's hard to find a good long play of the arcade one.

1485
01:25:18,720 --> 01:25:22,280
I did link another one that has better sound that's from the arcade.

1486
01:25:24,240 --> 01:25:29,400
But to go through it, there was an upgraded version that was pro Monaco GP that came out in 1980.

1487
01:25:29,800 --> 01:25:35,960
And then later on, it was ported to the SG1000 in 1983.

1488
01:25:36,520 --> 01:25:47,200
It also had later releases as a Super Monaco GP and Aiten Senn as a Super Monaco GP 2.

1489
01:25:47,680 --> 01:25:53,200
So, this one as well.

1490
01:25:53,200 --> 01:26:05,600
I mean, like I said, it was very well received and it's been re-released, you know, had sequels and everything.

1491
01:26:05,600 --> 01:26:12,720
But it even had re-released a remake, sorry, for PlayStation 2 and the Sega Aegis 2500 collection.

1492
01:26:13,560 --> 01:26:19,040
And it had a bunch of different add-ons, including more cars and game modes.

1493
01:26:19,520 --> 01:26:28,080
And the remake itself improved some of the gameplay that people were a little bit iffy about on the original.

1494
01:26:28,480 --> 01:26:42,240
So, I mean, there's a person from Replay, Eddie Adium, I'm going to say, I'm going to hope I pronounced it right.

1495
01:26:42,720 --> 01:26:49,800
That said that Monaco GP is one of the, quote, most evergreen games to come out from 1979.

1496
01:26:50,680 --> 01:26:59,000
And I, honestly, there's not really enough I can say about it really.

1497
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:02,520
It is a fairly obvious, fairly simple game.

1498
01:27:02,520 --> 01:27:06,280
But this is, again, the late 70s when this came out.

1499
01:27:06,920 --> 01:27:12,400
And it was a fairly, I would say, involved game for its time.

1500
01:27:12,600 --> 01:27:16,680
Now, we might call it simple now, but this game really did a lot of stuff.

1501
01:27:16,680 --> 01:27:23,320
And like I said, it was one of the last old school style TTL machines that Sega put out.

1502
01:27:23,320 --> 01:27:24,800
So it does have that distinction.

1503
01:27:26,080 --> 01:27:27,200
But that's it.

1504
01:27:27,480 --> 01:27:29,760
I was going to say, can I tell an interesting story about this game real quick?

1505
01:27:30,200 --> 01:27:31,080
Let me surprise you.

1506
01:27:32,280 --> 01:27:34,680
So I don't know if my dad is still out there watching.

1507
01:27:35,040 --> 01:27:37,760
He texted a picture earlier that he was watching.

1508
01:27:37,760 --> 01:27:40,760
So, hi, dad, if you're out there and thanks for watching tonight.

1509
01:27:41,640 --> 01:27:46,200
But way back in the day, we had a Commodore 64.

1510
01:27:46,200 --> 01:27:49,240
And I've talked about the C64 era a lot on this show.

1511
01:27:49,600 --> 01:27:55,840
And one of the games that my dad found and bought for this Commodore 64 that we had was a game called Le Mans.

1512
01:27:57,160 --> 01:28:05,160
And I remember that game quite fondly as one of the first games I really played when I was younger on that Commodore 64,

1513
01:28:05,160 --> 01:28:09,720
because it used the paddle, used that unique like Atari paddle kind of.

1514
01:28:09,880 --> 01:28:14,400
Actually, no, it was because you could plug the Atari controllers into the Commodore 64.

1515
01:28:14,400 --> 01:28:15,520
I forgot that that was like a thing.

1516
01:28:15,720 --> 01:28:17,560
So you use the paddle controller with it.

1517
01:28:18,040 --> 01:28:19,120
It was this game.

1518
01:28:19,520 --> 01:28:26,520
It was literally the exact same thing as this game down to the nighttime levels were in that as well.

1519
01:28:26,760 --> 01:28:31,440
So like it was very much a clone, a rip off or whatever of this.

1520
01:28:31,760 --> 01:28:36,800
And I never realized, you know, because I just always thought when I saw this type of game, I was like, oh, it's Le Mans.

1521
01:28:37,120 --> 01:28:40,960
And I'm like, oh, my God, it was inspired by this game.

1522
01:28:41,200 --> 01:28:46,120
So it was like a Commodore's clone of Monaco GP, which is so crazy to me.

1523
01:28:46,400 --> 01:28:50,800
So, yeah, one of my first first gaming memories is that game.

1524
01:28:50,960 --> 01:28:53,080
And so essentially it's this.

1525
01:28:53,200 --> 01:28:57,560
And I'm sure the audio, sorry if the audio kind of bugs a little bit, but it is, you know, it's a late 70s game.

1526
01:28:57,560 --> 01:29:02,680
I didn't have a lot of great audio, but the Commodore 64 version was really no better in that regard.

1527
01:29:02,680 --> 01:29:06,360
You know, it was like that constant engine noise you would hear in the game.

1528
01:29:06,360 --> 01:29:13,160
But I think that's just so interesting how it existed in my memory as a different game.

1529
01:29:13,160 --> 01:29:15,720
But that was one that was, in fact, inspired by this.

1530
01:29:17,200 --> 01:29:18,680
So. All right.

1531
01:29:19,480 --> 01:29:20,600
There it is. Excellent choice.

1532
01:29:20,600 --> 01:29:25,440
Dark Sakura, the classic game of the week is Monaco GP by Sega.

1533
01:29:25,440 --> 01:29:28,440
I am glad people approve of my choice.

1534
01:29:28,520 --> 01:29:29,640
Yeah. All right.

1535
01:29:29,960 --> 01:29:31,760
It's older than a lot of you kids.

1536
01:29:31,760 --> 01:29:32,560
Get off my lawn.

1537
01:29:32,560 --> 01:29:33,680
Sure is. It's about as old as I am.

1538
01:29:33,680 --> 01:29:35,640
Get me my pink drink and get off my lawn.

1539
01:29:36,360 --> 01:29:39,560
All right. Let's get into some rapid fire news.

1540
01:29:39,960 --> 01:29:41,480
Let's get to it. Loki.

1541
01:29:42,680 --> 01:29:51,360
Yes, so apparently Epic is thinking that, well, since they have all of the Halloween costumes now, that, hey, why not?

1542
01:29:51,360 --> 01:29:57,920
Let's expand out into scripted video programming, in other words, movies for Fortnite.

1543
01:29:58,360 --> 01:30:05,200
So perhaps we'll see a Fortnite movie or a Fortnite Netflix series or something to that effect.

1544
01:30:05,600 --> 01:30:07,680
But it is something that they are considering.

1545
01:30:08,280 --> 01:30:15,360
And why not? Because it is a pop culture phenomenon and they like money.

1546
01:30:15,800 --> 01:30:17,720
So, of course, they're going to do that.

1547
01:30:18,640 --> 01:30:21,400
So we'll have to wait and see. Fun times.

1548
01:30:22,480 --> 01:30:34,400
And then there's also the word basically with the announcement we had last week of Kingdom Hearts coming to the Switch via cloud versions.

1549
01:30:34,720 --> 01:30:39,720
They were asked if, you know, there is a way to get this to run natively instead of via the cloud service.

1550
01:30:39,720 --> 01:30:45,120
And it's something that they're, you know, not sure they're undecided on trying to pursue.

1551
01:30:45,120 --> 01:30:46,440
But it is, you know.

1552
01:30:48,160 --> 01:30:57,800
It's not going to happen on this hardware, I'm going to tell you that right now, but we'll like to to think that, you know, maybe they'll figure out a way to do it.

1553
01:30:58,880 --> 01:31:00,240
I mean, they did it with The Witcher 3.

1554
01:31:00,240 --> 01:31:02,960
I don't know why they can't do this, but we'll see.

1555
01:31:05,240 --> 01:31:06,680
All right, Dark Sakura.

1556
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:14,040
So there is a release date now for Gate of Nightmares.

1557
01:31:15,560 --> 01:31:23,360
It is going to be out, it's a JRPG done by Mashima Ahido, who is also behind Fairy Tail.

1558
01:31:24,360 --> 01:31:29,360
It's going to be released on October 26th for iOS and Android.

1559
01:31:30,360 --> 01:31:34,720
And it's looking like it's going to be pretty fun.

1560
01:31:34,720 --> 01:31:37,200
So, yeah, October 26, go get it.

1561
01:31:38,400 --> 01:31:40,200
I think that looks really neat.

1562
01:31:40,200 --> 01:31:41,400
I love that art style, too.

1563
01:31:42,800 --> 01:31:46,920
And sadder news, though, for fans of Rocksmith, of which I know three.

1564
01:31:49,600 --> 01:31:58,480
While Ubisoft is working on Rocksmith Plus, the original Rocksmith from 2011 and all of its DLC

1565
01:31:59,160 --> 01:32:06,720
are being removed from digital stores that is starting on today on the 17th.

1566
01:32:07,080 --> 01:32:10,640
So as of today, it's being pulled and delisted.

1567
01:32:11,760 --> 01:32:16,720
We all know somebody who used to work on Rocksmith, not let's not say them on air, but we all do.

1568
01:32:16,840 --> 01:32:24,240
Yeah, yeah, but I'm talking about the people who actually are good at this and learned to play freaking guitar from it.

1569
01:32:24,400 --> 01:32:25,440
It was my idea.

1570
01:32:26,080 --> 01:32:30,040
Yeah, well, I mean, we're going to have another one, just the old ones going away.

1571
01:32:30,200 --> 01:32:34,120
Right. Out with the old and with the new, I guess.

1572
01:32:34,360 --> 01:32:35,880
Yeah, the old was 10 years old.

1573
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:37,000
It's fine. Yeah, true.

1574
01:32:37,520 --> 01:32:41,960
It's dated. Like this program.

1575
01:32:43,640 --> 01:32:45,600
Girl. All right.

1576
01:32:46,160 --> 01:32:52,360
Let's travel around the world and check out that hot new current stuff that all the kids are going to be talking about and the release dates from this week.

1577
01:32:52,680 --> 01:32:54,720
Loki, we'll start with you and the U.S. release dates.

1578
01:32:55,520 --> 01:33:02,320
Yes. So this week we have the Caligula Effect 2 on Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4.

1579
01:33:02,920 --> 01:33:06,400
Dying Light Platinum Edition on Nintendo Switch.

1580
01:33:07,120 --> 01:33:14,160
Corpse Party on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One and Xbox Series X.

1581
01:33:15,760 --> 01:33:22,040
Disciples Liberation on PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One and Xbox Series X.

1582
01:33:22,760 --> 01:33:27,320
Echo Generation, which I'm very much looking forward to, this is an awesome looking game.

1583
01:33:27,720 --> 01:33:29,720
Xbox One, Xbox Series X.

1584
01:33:30,880 --> 01:33:33,960
We have Ever Tried on Nintendo Switch.

1585
01:33:35,360 --> 01:33:39,920
Ghaul, the Hero Slayer on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

1586
01:33:40,640 --> 01:33:46,360
Toy Soldiers HD on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

1587
01:33:46,960 --> 01:33:57,400
And last but not least, the Dark Pictures Anthology House of Ashes on PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X.

1588
01:33:58,680 --> 01:34:03,200
I can't believe you'd be leaving out this title I'm looking at for the Nintendo Switch.

1589
01:34:03,200 --> 01:34:05,040
That's definitely Game of the Year material.

1590
01:34:05,280 --> 01:34:08,960
It's my friend, Peppa Pig, is out on the switch this week in the U.S.

1591
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:09,880
How dare you, Loki?

1592
01:34:10,440 --> 01:34:13,360
It's not on my list, so I'm not sure if it actually is.

1593
01:34:13,920 --> 01:34:14,840
Oh, it's on my list.

1594
01:34:14,840 --> 01:34:15,480
It's lies.

1595
01:34:15,520 --> 01:34:16,760
Somehow on mine.

1596
01:34:16,800 --> 01:34:21,400
All right. Anyway, moving over to Japan and checking out releases over there.

1597
01:34:21,960 --> 01:34:24,520
Blue Reflection, second light on the switch this week.

1598
01:34:24,520 --> 01:34:27,800
And Archetype Arcadia is out this week in Japan.

1599
01:34:28,440 --> 01:34:30,240
That's it really for the Nintendo Switch.

1600
01:34:30,240 --> 01:34:33,080
Taking a look at the PlayStation 5 this week in Japan.

1601
01:34:34,480 --> 01:34:35,960
I don't think we have anything at all.

1602
01:34:37,120 --> 01:34:39,200
Let me take a slow week all over.

1603
01:34:39,200 --> 01:34:42,560
It is all over. I'm just briefly looking at the PlayStation 4.

1604
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:45,440
That same Blue Reflection, second light, Archetype Arcadia.

1605
01:34:45,440 --> 01:34:47,280
Both those games also on the PlayStation 4.

1606
01:34:47,520 --> 01:34:50,080
But that's really it. Yeah, slow week out there, too.

1607
01:34:50,840 --> 01:34:51,880
Darsakra, how about the UK?

1608
01:34:53,320 --> 01:34:55,840
Only three things, and that's for the 22nd.

1609
01:34:55,880 --> 01:35:00,880
We have the Dark Pictures Triple Pack for PlayStation and Xbox.

1610
01:35:01,480 --> 01:35:03,640
We have my friend, Peppa Pigu.

1611
01:35:03,880 --> 01:35:04,720
I'm sorry, Pig.

1612
01:35:05,760 --> 01:35:08,360
I'm going to Photoshop her into Pig, by the way.

1613
01:35:09,360 --> 01:35:12,560
That's on PlayStation, Xbox and Switch.

1614
01:35:13,040 --> 01:35:17,640
And then on Xbox and PlayStation, again,

1615
01:35:17,640 --> 01:35:20,920
we have the Dark Pictures Anthology, House of Ashes.

1616
01:35:23,280 --> 01:35:24,280
All right.

1617
01:35:25,840 --> 01:35:28,000
That's it for the release date.

1618
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:29,040
Oh, go ahead.

1619
01:35:29,040 --> 01:35:32,000
For the record, speaking of Pigu, I forgot to mention.

1620
01:35:32,240 --> 01:35:37,160
OK, I got to pick the name for Pig in our friend

1621
01:35:37,400 --> 01:35:39,280
Nick and Princess Nuzlocke thing today.

1622
01:35:40,520 --> 01:35:43,560
And her name is Amanda Lorien.

1623
01:35:43,560 --> 01:35:48,160
I like these cute little things since you brought that up in general talk,

1624
01:35:48,640 --> 01:35:52,880
not just DBD, but obviously you and I watch a lot of the streams we see a lot.

1625
01:35:53,160 --> 01:35:56,600
I like these cute little challenges that streamers come up for themselves with this.

1626
01:35:56,600 --> 01:35:59,320
And I guess this whole Nuzlocke thing is based off a Pokemon concept.

1627
01:35:59,320 --> 01:36:03,440
It is a lot of Pokemon streamers kind of do and started in that whole regard.

1628
01:36:03,680 --> 01:36:06,600
So I like these cute little challenges that people develop

1629
01:36:06,600 --> 01:36:08,800
for themselves on Twitch. I think it's cute.

1630
01:36:08,800 --> 01:36:12,920
So I just like that he's letting everyone pick nicknames, but I actually

1631
01:36:14,240 --> 01:36:17,720
did my sub in such a way that I got to actually just straight out pick a name.

1632
01:36:18,240 --> 01:36:22,360
So so, yeah, so as a result of that, I actually

1633
01:36:23,320 --> 01:36:25,680
I hate seeing photoshopped because I don't use Photoshop anymore.

1634
01:36:25,960 --> 01:36:32,040
I affinity photoed a picture of pig instead of wearing the pig mask.

1635
01:36:32,040 --> 01:36:34,840
She's wearing the Mandalorian helmet. Perfect.

1636
01:36:34,840 --> 01:36:37,840
I'm very proud of my work.

1637
01:36:38,080 --> 01:36:41,400
And then she was instantly eliminated from the Nuzlocke the first game.

1638
01:36:41,440 --> 01:36:42,680
I'm just kidding. No, I didn't.

1639
01:36:42,680 --> 01:36:47,280
I actually actually made it back for the last half of the first game

1640
01:36:47,520 --> 01:36:49,760
because I thought I'd have time to go do my makeup and everything.

1641
01:36:50,040 --> 01:36:53,320
And it was it was a pig who was winner.

1642
01:36:53,840 --> 01:36:56,400
Oh, fun. OK, it was best do.

1643
01:36:57,640 --> 01:37:01,200
Let's move on. We have some more stories for you guys due to the late start tonight.

1644
01:37:01,200 --> 01:37:03,840
I think we're going to kind of pick up the pace with these last few stories here.

1645
01:37:04,520 --> 01:37:06,640
And because I know we have at least two emails tonight

1646
01:37:06,640 --> 01:37:09,120
and I want to see if we can try to squeeze in a call or two.

1647
01:37:09,320 --> 01:37:12,280
But to do that, we're going to go through these stories a little faster than usual.

1648
01:37:12,280 --> 01:37:14,920
It's just, I think, like five stories. So we'll start with Loki.

1649
01:37:15,880 --> 01:37:20,680
Yeah, so Sony's finally letting us buy PlayStation fives directly from them.

1650
01:37:21,160 --> 01:37:22,840
They put up a website to go ahead and do that.

1651
01:37:22,840 --> 01:37:25,800
You have to put your username in there to try to restrict it.

1652
01:37:25,920 --> 01:37:27,800
One per household.

1653
01:37:27,800 --> 01:37:31,440
Also, probably the fact that, you know, a lot of these other bigger chains

1654
01:37:31,640 --> 01:37:34,360
like Best Buy and stuff are scalping them, which is nice.

1655
01:37:35,680 --> 01:37:40,160
So, yeah, if you're interested in purchasing a PlayStation five,

1656
01:37:40,160 --> 01:37:43,040
then you probably want to go to PlayStation dot com to their register

1657
01:37:43,040 --> 01:37:48,200
the buy page and register to do that to see if you can pick one up.

1658
01:37:49,160 --> 01:37:51,200
You know, Jason kind of referenced that in the intro tonight

1659
01:37:51,200 --> 01:37:54,240
about how the retailers must not be so happy about the hat.

1660
01:37:54,240 --> 01:37:57,320
But I also kind of don't scalp it.

1661
01:37:57,440 --> 01:38:00,400
Yeah, I also see why it's in Sony's interest to do that,

1662
01:38:00,600 --> 01:38:03,960
especially when we talk about, you know, these shortages of consoles.

1663
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:06,600
You know, we had that story about Microsoft a couple of weeks ago.

1664
01:38:06,920 --> 01:38:09,400
These shortages don't look like they're going to ease up anytime soon.

1665
01:38:09,400 --> 01:38:11,280
That's a lot of what we're hearing about in the news.

1666
01:38:11,280 --> 01:38:14,400
News outside of gaming world is like how, you know,

1667
01:38:14,400 --> 01:38:16,600
the ships are having troubles getting into docks

1668
01:38:16,600 --> 01:38:19,000
because there's not as many workers, the docks, et cetera.

1669
01:38:19,200 --> 01:38:20,560
It's kind of having this ripple effect.

1670
01:38:20,560 --> 01:38:24,320
Or is it all because of that ship that was stuck in the Suez Canal?

1671
01:38:24,360 --> 01:38:27,920
Is it all because of that is all because of the evergreen that is happening?

1672
01:38:28,480 --> 01:38:29,280
I don't know. I shouldn't.

1673
01:38:29,280 --> 01:38:32,160
I shouldn't laugh because it is a lot of problems.

1674
01:38:33,120 --> 01:38:36,000
But yeah, now we're hearing about these supply chains are picking up.

1675
01:38:36,200 --> 01:38:38,720
But that isn't probably going to have much impact,

1676
01:38:38,720 --> 01:38:40,520
unfortunately, on PlayStation five.

1677
01:38:40,520 --> 01:38:42,080
So. All right.

1678
01:38:42,080 --> 01:38:45,280
And as Joe and her mat says, not really today's

1679
01:38:45,520 --> 01:38:48,080
and referring to today's problems, are they caused by the evergreen?

1680
01:38:48,200 --> 01:38:49,720
But it was a problem for a bit.

1681
01:38:49,720 --> 01:38:53,200
And Mike Deaf says it's column A, column B. All right. All right.

1682
01:38:54,040 --> 01:38:56,160
Moving on. I think this is interesting.

1683
01:38:56,160 --> 01:38:59,760
The all chat or slash all chat is being disabled,

1684
01:38:59,760 --> 01:39:02,880
at least for a brief time in League of Legends there.

1685
01:39:03,080 --> 01:39:06,280
The developers have made a decision to keep this off for a couple of patches

1686
01:39:06,480 --> 01:39:08,120
and ask players for feedback.

1687
01:39:08,120 --> 01:39:12,160
So usually you can use slash all to chat with folks from the other team

1688
01:39:12,160 --> 01:39:13,280
after a match.

1689
01:39:13,280 --> 01:39:16,880
And as I'm sure that goes well in many cases, right?

1690
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:19,200
I'm sure people know how to behave themselves

1691
01:39:19,320 --> 01:39:21,600
and respect the other players at the end of a match.

1692
01:39:21,760 --> 01:39:25,520
I haven't played League of Legends because the one time I did play it,

1693
01:39:25,520 --> 01:39:27,760
somebody used that all feature to say something.

1694
01:39:27,880 --> 01:39:30,000
And I decided I didn't want to play anymore.

1695
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:32,800
So I can and you know, it's interesting.

1696
01:39:34,160 --> 01:39:36,200
I think this could be a response.

1697
01:39:36,200 --> 01:39:38,760
Maybe this is me being a little tinfoil hatty, but I don't care.

1698
01:39:39,840 --> 01:39:42,280
I think this could be a response to Pokemon Unite.

1699
01:39:43,280 --> 01:39:46,560
And why a lot of people are kind of loving that MOBA right now.

1700
01:39:46,560 --> 01:39:48,320
Now, granted, maybe I kind of stopped playing it,

1701
01:39:48,320 --> 01:39:49,640
but I've kind of kept an eye on it

1702
01:39:49,640 --> 01:39:51,920
and I see some streamers that are still doing it and stuff.

1703
01:39:51,920 --> 01:39:54,960
And I think part of why people are apt to play that game

1704
01:39:55,200 --> 01:39:58,040
is because there is no chat feature and that, you know,

1705
01:39:58,040 --> 01:40:01,160
you only have the brief little phrases you can say to each other.

1706
01:40:01,160 --> 01:40:04,520
It's enough to send some basic communication about the game.

1707
01:40:04,640 --> 01:40:06,720
And sure, there's some things that annoy people,

1708
01:40:06,720 --> 01:40:09,480
like people voting to abandon a game too soon and things like that.

1709
01:40:09,680 --> 01:40:11,240
But for the most part,

1710
01:40:11,240 --> 01:40:14,520
not having to put up with the straight up toxic and abusive chat

1711
01:40:14,520 --> 01:40:17,400
that sometimes faces the player chat at the end of a game

1712
01:40:18,600 --> 01:40:20,880
is probably a refreshing feeling. Quite frankly.

1713
01:40:22,320 --> 01:40:23,960
I wish they do this in Dead by Daylight, too.

1714
01:40:24,960 --> 01:40:26,760
I would not miss that postgame chat one bit.

1715
01:40:27,320 --> 01:40:31,440
So anyway, that's why I think the Windows store

1716
01:40:31,440 --> 01:40:33,800
is actually the best place to play Dead by Daylight.

1717
01:40:33,800 --> 01:40:36,920
Actually, Stadia is not bad either, because you can kind of like see it,

1718
01:40:36,920 --> 01:40:39,360
but you're not expected to participate in that chat.

1719
01:40:39,360 --> 01:40:40,760
But anyway. All right.

1720
01:40:43,400 --> 01:40:46,200
Also, you can still see with what League of Legends is doing,

1721
01:40:46,200 --> 01:40:49,200
the control one, two, three, four spam emotes and things like that.

1722
01:40:49,200 --> 01:40:51,240
So it's not going to stop teabagging or anything like that.

1723
01:40:51,720 --> 01:40:54,280
However, it seems like this might not last long.

1724
01:40:54,280 --> 01:40:56,800
The reaction to this change has been negative.

1725
01:40:57,120 --> 01:41:00,040
People saying that, you know, when they actually bond with people

1726
01:41:00,040 --> 01:41:03,440
and when the system works well, they kind of miss that.

1727
01:41:03,640 --> 01:41:06,680
And that the toxic behavior is actually happening with team chats.

1728
01:41:06,680 --> 01:41:10,080
And I could absolutely see that and agree with that as well.

1729
01:41:10,960 --> 01:41:13,920
This has been clarified on Twitter that they're just testing this

1730
01:41:14,080 --> 01:41:17,680
and they will keep or reverse the change based on the feedback they get.

1731
01:41:17,680 --> 01:41:21,600
They should just let people opt in or out of those chats completely, quite frankly.

1732
01:41:22,600 --> 01:41:27,000
Mike Defton chat says, people are still hella toxic in Unite, though. How?

1733
01:41:28,080 --> 01:41:30,520
I guess maybe just through emotes or their actions.

1734
01:41:30,520 --> 01:41:32,080
I could see that that maybe people through there,

1735
01:41:32,080 --> 01:41:36,120
like they start to do actions that negatively impact the team.

1736
01:41:36,120 --> 01:41:39,440
I could see that you're just you're not going to get unfortunate.

1737
01:41:39,440 --> 01:41:43,880
Like people are going to be shitty any way they can sometimes, unfortunately. So.

1738
01:41:45,840 --> 01:41:48,800
And fifth dream says, even the Pokemon moba is toxic.

1739
01:41:48,800 --> 01:41:51,240
So I bet that all chat is terrible.

1740
01:41:52,560 --> 01:41:53,560
All right.

1741
01:41:55,160 --> 01:41:56,160
Let's see.

1742
01:41:56,840 --> 01:41:59,800
Mike Defton says, though, I prefer Unite to other MOBAs.

1743
01:42:00,240 --> 01:42:04,560
All those comments coming from our chat over Twitch.TV slash VOG Network.

1744
01:42:05,080 --> 01:42:06,080
Dark Sakura.

1745
01:42:07,280 --> 01:42:11,480
So this isn't really like super surprising,

1746
01:42:11,880 --> 01:42:19,000
but it turns out that video game industry has really been learning that

1747
01:42:19,840 --> 01:42:23,960
a lot of people are able to work from home.

1748
01:42:24,280 --> 01:42:25,680
They can work remotely

1749
01:42:27,680 --> 01:42:30,840
as long as they've got the machinery that they need for it.

1750
01:42:31,600 --> 01:42:33,240
But yeah, like, for example,

1751
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:36,080
Asper Media,

1752
01:42:37,280 --> 01:42:39,000
who's based out of Austin, Texas,

1753
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:43,400
working on Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic remake.

1754
01:42:43,800 --> 01:42:44,560
They're great with it.

1755
01:42:44,560 --> 01:42:46,800
They're letting their people work from home,

1756
01:42:47,000 --> 01:42:50,520
and they are highly productive when doing it.

1757
01:42:51,160 --> 01:42:54,360
Whereas some of these other companies like, no, you have to be here.

1758
01:42:55,400 --> 01:42:58,520
Like you make someone sign an NDA and they can work from home.

1759
01:42:59,360 --> 01:43:02,280
I mean, there's a lot of advantages to it,

1760
01:43:02,280 --> 01:43:05,840
as well as just keeping their employees safe and giving

1761
01:43:05,840 --> 01:43:10,280
giving them a healthier work life balance, I think,

1762
01:43:10,760 --> 01:43:16,120
because they don't have to worry about, you know, the commute, the gas,

1763
01:43:16,320 --> 01:43:20,640
the not seeing their their home, I guess that makes sense.

1764
01:43:21,480 --> 01:43:25,680
But actually being present in a dedicated space for it,

1765
01:43:25,680 --> 01:43:27,840
then they can leave and they're already home.

1766
01:43:28,520 --> 01:43:30,200
That's how I feel about my job anyway.

1767
01:43:30,200 --> 01:43:33,680
Right. I could see where, you know, I know a lot of video game companies

1768
01:43:33,680 --> 01:43:36,160
have been struggling with the whole work at home thing

1769
01:43:36,160 --> 01:43:38,280
because there is so much collaboration that happens.

1770
01:43:38,280 --> 01:43:42,520
I just I would think a hybrid solution is probably very doable

1771
01:43:42,520 --> 01:43:43,520
for a lot of companies.

1772
01:43:43,520 --> 01:43:45,880
We're like, maybe we're in the office Tuesday, Thursday,

1773
01:43:46,080 --> 01:43:48,320
but we're work from home Monday, Wednesday, Friday, something like that,

1774
01:43:48,320 --> 01:43:51,440
where, you know, so at least some of some of those collaborations can happen.

1775
01:43:51,440 --> 01:43:54,960
But I would also greatly see, A, I haven't worked in the game industry,

1776
01:43:54,960 --> 01:43:55,640
so I don't really know.

1777
01:43:55,640 --> 01:43:58,600
B, I could see where maybe that works for some companies, not for others.

1778
01:43:58,960 --> 01:44:01,880
And OK, so.

1779
01:44:02,800 --> 01:44:04,640
But I'm not surprised to hear that some of the companies

1780
01:44:04,640 --> 01:44:05,360
are going to stick with it.

1781
01:44:05,360 --> 01:44:10,320
I'm really not because, you know, the companies can also look at it

1782
01:44:10,320 --> 01:44:15,480
as we can save on not having to rent a giant building for all the office space.

1783
01:44:15,720 --> 01:44:18,760
We can have a small place for the occasional collaborations

1784
01:44:18,760 --> 01:44:21,520
and things like that, but we don't need all this space otherwise.

1785
01:44:21,720 --> 01:44:24,320
I think that's I think that's going to be the most interesting thing post

1786
01:44:24,320 --> 01:44:28,720
pandemic is what happens to a lot of these these job places

1787
01:44:29,000 --> 01:44:31,280
where the workforces are going completely remote.

1788
01:44:32,320 --> 01:44:34,560
Are they going to be like a collaborative workspace

1789
01:44:34,560 --> 01:44:37,040
and you're going to see more of those type of pop up?

1790
01:44:37,520 --> 01:44:38,720
I wouldn't be mad about it.

1791
01:44:38,720 --> 01:44:41,920
I mean, honestly enough, like I was actually just kind of thinking

1792
01:44:41,920 --> 01:44:43,760
about where I work.

1793
01:44:43,760 --> 01:44:49,680
They just built a huge new building in Austin for our group there,

1794
01:44:50,120 --> 01:44:55,320
and they're doing all kinds of building work for for us at mine.

1795
01:44:55,320 --> 01:44:56,880
You know, not saying where I work,

1796
01:44:58,320 --> 01:45:00,480
but at the same time, it.

1797
01:45:02,400 --> 01:45:06,120
I think half of the reason that some companies want people to be

1798
01:45:06,760 --> 01:45:12,280
in in a location is for culture, at least that's what it is with with my job.

1799
01:45:12,440 --> 01:45:14,760
A lot of it has to do with our culture of collaboration.

1800
01:45:15,360 --> 01:45:19,760
But at the same time, you know, I think that.

1801
01:45:21,120 --> 01:45:23,720
There has to come a point where you need to learn

1802
01:45:24,160 --> 01:45:27,760
to balance the bigger picture with that culture,

1803
01:45:27,760 --> 01:45:30,800
and I don't think culture has suffered at all where I work.

1804
01:45:30,800 --> 01:45:33,160
We're still collaborating and we're still talking.

1805
01:45:33,640 --> 01:45:36,360
You know, we're still helping each other out.

1806
01:45:36,360 --> 01:45:37,840
We're just doing it remotely now.

1807
01:45:37,840 --> 01:45:40,040
It just changed the method of our communication.

1808
01:45:40,080 --> 01:45:44,320
Same for us, and we do very different things at our day jobs. Exactly.

1809
01:45:46,240 --> 01:45:48,720
Critical myth in chat says my company is leasing out parts

1810
01:45:48,720 --> 01:45:51,400
of our corporate buildings since they have so many of us working remotely now.

1811
01:45:51,920 --> 01:45:55,400
S.J. 100 Matt says my job was forced to go full remote during the pandemic

1812
01:45:55,400 --> 01:45:56,200
due to the pandemic.

1813
01:45:56,200 --> 01:45:58,000
Excuse me. And we were forced to figure it out.

1814
01:45:58,000 --> 01:46:00,200
Now we have no plans of being back in an office again.

1815
01:46:00,200 --> 01:46:03,280
So it's possible if companies support their staff to get the right equipment.

1816
01:46:03,520 --> 01:46:08,320
And I should have had Matt not to like talk about your business on air too much.

1817
01:46:08,320 --> 01:46:09,440
So I apologize in advance.

1818
01:46:09,440 --> 01:46:12,240
But aren't you like moving to now?

1819
01:46:12,240 --> 01:46:15,600
So because like you don't have to commute as much anymore.

1820
01:46:15,600 --> 01:46:17,680
Like I thought I was picking up on that was a thing.

1821
01:46:18,200 --> 01:46:20,560
And you're not alone in that regard.

1822
01:46:20,560 --> 01:46:21,080
There's a lot of people.

1823
01:46:21,080 --> 01:46:23,880
And you even said in chat there, oh, you moved a year ago.

1824
01:46:23,880 --> 01:46:26,040
Shit, I'm slow, aren't I?

1825
01:46:26,920 --> 01:46:30,240
But OK, so but the point and the why so kind of stands, right?

1826
01:46:30,840 --> 01:46:34,440
S.J. 100 Matt says it's already a huge problem in New York City and San Francisco.

1827
01:46:34,440 --> 01:46:37,080
I'm so curious what San Francisco is going to look like in 10 years.

1828
01:46:37,560 --> 01:46:39,840
So curious.

1829
01:46:39,840 --> 01:46:40,760
I love San Francisco.

1830
01:46:40,760 --> 01:46:42,640
I love the culture. I love the town.

1831
01:46:42,640 --> 01:46:46,160
It's always been prohibitively expensive to do a lot there.

1832
01:46:46,160 --> 01:46:49,360
So I'm super curious to see what this is going to do.

1833
01:46:49,640 --> 01:46:51,040
Going to be interesting.

1834
01:46:51,040 --> 01:46:53,880
Anyway, go ahead.

1835
01:46:53,880 --> 01:46:57,200
I was also just thinking, you know.

1836
01:46:58,400 --> 01:47:02,160
There's a lot of attitudes,

1837
01:47:02,160 --> 01:47:05,960
I think, that are rooted in the old way.

1838
01:47:06,120 --> 01:47:07,640
Does that make sense?

1839
01:47:08,520 --> 01:47:13,960
So I think that it's going to require not just you have to do this for now,

1840
01:47:14,480 --> 01:47:16,520
but there has to be like a total shift of mindset.

1841
01:47:17,840 --> 01:47:20,640
My work wants us back in January.

1842
01:47:20,640 --> 01:47:22,400
I don't think it's going to happen.

1843
01:47:22,400 --> 01:47:26,160
Ours are well, we we've pretty much said we're going to be work

1844
01:47:26,160 --> 01:47:28,480
from home is an option forever, pretty much.

1845
01:47:28,720 --> 01:47:32,000
But they want to do some things in person, which I get like training.

1846
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:34,240
They want to do in person, which is very near and dear to my heart.

1847
01:47:34,240 --> 01:47:35,760
And I completely get that.

1848
01:47:36,240 --> 01:47:38,280
I should say when it makes sense.

1849
01:47:38,280 --> 01:47:40,880
There are some trainings still virtual is completely fine.

1850
01:47:40,880 --> 01:47:43,040
But I totally get there are some job

1851
01:47:43,720 --> 01:47:45,760
skill based training they really want to do in person.

1852
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:49,720
So I think it's just a matter of when is it safe to do that really?

1853
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:53,240
And that kind of keeps getting pushed back for us as well.

1854
01:47:53,440 --> 01:47:57,400
And I they're not they're not saying when I'm

1855
01:47:57,800 --> 01:48:00,480
but I'm guessing January is what they're looking at,

1856
01:48:00,480 --> 01:48:03,920
but kind of not saying anything until they're going to commit to it this time.

1857
01:48:04,520 --> 01:48:05,120
If that makes sense.

1858
01:48:05,120 --> 01:48:05,640
No.

1859
01:48:06,840 --> 01:48:11,600
Mine mine said September and then October and now January and.

1860
01:48:13,680 --> 01:48:16,400
I still don't feel comfortable going back, but it is what it is.

1861
01:48:18,400 --> 01:48:20,520
Yeah. All right.

1862
01:48:20,520 --> 01:48:22,760
Let's move on to our next story, Loki.

1863
01:48:24,240 --> 01:48:27,000
All right, so we're talking about speed runners,

1864
01:48:27,280 --> 01:48:31,120
of course, when we're talking about cheating, and that's the case

1865
01:48:31,120 --> 01:48:36,480
with Barry Mode's record for, I believe, the classic Spelunky.

1866
01:48:36,960 --> 01:48:42,520
And it was found that he had used, I think, a.

1867
01:48:44,240 --> 01:48:49,440
Program to basically kind of it's almost like a task where he was able to

1868
01:48:51,080 --> 01:48:53,560
basically reset points where he.

1869
01:48:54,720 --> 01:48:57,000
Died in like redo that section.

1870
01:48:57,000 --> 01:48:59,840
So he said, well, I, you know, I ran it,

1871
01:49:00,080 --> 01:49:04,920
but, you know, I just remove the this I eliminated the starting over factor,

1872
01:49:05,480 --> 01:49:07,760
because that's why a big part of speed running is hard.

1873
01:49:07,960 --> 01:49:11,560
So he doesn't really think that he cheated, but obviously his

1874
01:49:11,720 --> 01:49:14,960
he's deleted his video, they posted online, they submitted to

1875
01:49:16,560 --> 01:49:19,120
the speed running scene and also, of course,

1876
01:49:20,680 --> 01:49:23,760
didn't confess to any of this stuff until it was pointed out

1877
01:49:24,080 --> 01:49:29,520
that there was a missing tile that was appearing any time that the screen changed.

1878
01:49:29,840 --> 01:49:36,000
And that was a symptom of a certain program that it's used to kind of automate that.

1879
01:49:38,800 --> 01:49:39,680
Shame, shame.

1880
01:49:41,720 --> 01:49:43,400
Pixel pockets and chat says, wow.

1881
01:49:43,400 --> 01:49:43,760
Yeah.

1882
01:49:43,800 --> 01:49:44,080
Wow.

1883
01:49:44,080 --> 01:49:44,480
Indeed.

1884
01:49:47,200 --> 01:49:47,720
All right.

1885
01:49:47,760 --> 01:49:48,040
Yeah.

1886
01:49:48,040 --> 01:49:52,000
And it was apparently it was such a good record that, you know,

1887
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:53,000
no one's been able to beat it.

1888
01:49:53,040 --> 01:49:58,320
Well, yeah, obviously, because, you know, wasn't all through one run, but.

1889
01:50:00,320 --> 01:50:02,200
Yeah, what are you going to do?

1890
01:50:02,200 --> 01:50:02,760
All right.

1891
01:50:02,760 --> 01:50:03,840
I know disqualify him.

1892
01:50:03,840 --> 01:50:04,320
That's what you're going to do.

1893
01:50:04,320 --> 01:50:05,320
That's what you're going to do.

1894
01:50:05,320 --> 01:50:05,760
All right.

1895
01:50:06,760 --> 01:50:08,960
Lastly, tonight, before we get to the roundtable,

1896
01:50:09,280 --> 01:50:12,240
I want to talk about this, I think this is great.

1897
01:50:12,480 --> 01:50:15,440
The Xbox Series X fridge is happening.

1898
01:50:15,480 --> 01:50:17,600
It's a real thing and you can preorder it.

1899
01:50:17,840 --> 01:50:18,520
Here's the thing.

1900
01:50:18,520 --> 01:50:22,360
They made it a mini fridge, I guess, to make it a little more consumer.

1901
01:50:22,560 --> 01:50:25,680
I'm assuming with all the problems going on with deliveries in the world,

1902
01:50:25,680 --> 01:50:28,000
so probably makes it a little easier to deliver on to.

1903
01:50:28,200 --> 01:50:31,480
But the Xbox mini fridge will be available for the holidays.

1904
01:50:31,760 --> 01:50:36,480
The fridge costs one hundred dollars and preorder start in two days.

1905
01:50:36,480 --> 01:50:37,400
So the 19th.

1906
01:50:38,920 --> 01:50:45,080
So, yeah, the mini fridge, of course, is like the actual fridge that Xbox tweeted.

1907
01:50:45,080 --> 01:50:48,760
I think they who think if they give one to Snoop Dogg and somebody else, I think.

1908
01:50:48,760 --> 01:50:51,000
Yeah. So they gave the fridge the fridge.

1909
01:50:51,440 --> 01:50:54,800
But the mini fridge will still be great for storing your weed.

1910
01:50:54,960 --> 01:50:59,040
If you want to put that in there and a couple of sodas or whatever.

1911
01:50:59,360 --> 01:51:01,520
So anyway, I think that's great.

1912
01:51:01,520 --> 01:51:03,760
I think that's so funny. I actually kind of want one.

1913
01:51:03,760 --> 01:51:04,960
I'm going to be honest.

1914
01:51:05,160 --> 01:51:07,840
I imagine it's the size of an actual Xbox console.

1915
01:51:09,080 --> 01:51:10,120
I think that's really cool.

1916
01:51:11,040 --> 01:51:12,480
Mike Deff says I would buy it.

1917
01:51:12,720 --> 01:51:14,640
Fifth Dream says store your KFC in it.

1918
01:51:14,640 --> 01:51:18,560
Sure. Although I hope you I hope you like Kentucky Fried Gold.

1919
01:51:20,480 --> 01:51:21,920
Anyway, I think that's great.

1920
01:51:22,320 --> 01:51:25,480
All right, let's get to the roundtable.

1921
01:51:25,880 --> 01:51:28,680
We will try to get I don't know if anybody wants to call.

1922
01:51:28,680 --> 01:51:31,560
Join the green room so I can get an idea how many calls we have.

1923
01:51:31,760 --> 01:51:34,640
But I know we have emails tonight, so I'm going to get to it.

1924
01:51:35,360 --> 01:51:38,440
Oh, Bobby Black Wolf says, considering it for the basement.

1925
01:51:38,440 --> 01:51:41,240
Oh, do it. It looks so good down there, Bobby.

1926
01:51:41,240 --> 01:51:43,960
Right out right outside of Black Wolf Theater.

1927
01:51:43,960 --> 01:51:48,640
It'd be great, especially, you know, keep some keep some sodas in there and, you know,

1928
01:51:48,640 --> 01:51:52,760
maybe wine or beer if you're so inclined that people can enjoy while they're having a movie.

1929
01:51:52,760 --> 01:51:54,640
I love that. Love that.

1930
01:51:55,840 --> 01:51:58,680
Pixel Pocket says they said it can hold 12 cans.

1931
01:51:58,680 --> 01:52:02,120
So it's probably a little bigger than just your typical Xbox Series X.

1932
01:52:02,320 --> 01:52:03,960
Yeah, that makes sense. Probably a little bigger.

1933
01:52:03,960 --> 01:52:08,080
So anyway, your emails participate at orange.traded.com.

1934
01:52:08,080 --> 01:52:12,120
And it's I feel like for weeks and weeks on the show, I've said no emails, no emails, no emails.

1935
01:52:12,480 --> 01:52:14,240
And now we got three.

1936
01:52:14,560 --> 01:52:15,880
Yeah, we got a few. Let's get to it.

1937
01:52:15,920 --> 01:52:16,920
Dark Sakura.

1938
01:52:18,920 --> 01:52:20,800
So first one's a little long.

1939
01:52:20,800 --> 01:52:22,480
OK. Hello, LR.

1940
01:52:22,480 --> 01:52:26,160
I was catching up on slightly out of date episodes and I figured I'd drop a line.

1941
01:52:26,160 --> 01:52:29,960
But since I can't fit a fishing line in here, an email will happen instead.

1942
01:52:30,000 --> 01:52:31,000
Whomp.

1943
01:52:31,440 --> 01:52:35,680
During the October 3rd episode, there was a bit of confusion regarding two games,

1944
01:52:35,680 --> 01:52:37,120
Paddle Dipon and Puzzle Dipon.

1945
01:52:37,640 --> 01:52:39,760
The confusion is totally understandable.

1946
01:52:39,760 --> 01:52:44,400
I didn't realize it at the time I was listening, but both games were actually released in Japan during the same year.

1947
01:52:45,400 --> 01:52:49,560
With such similar games and release dates, it's no wonder they're easy to confuse.

1948
01:52:49,800 --> 01:52:56,400
Amazingly, despite its undoubtedly low distribution for the U.S., Puzzle Dipon, the first puzzle bobble style game ever released

1949
01:52:56,960 --> 01:53:02,640
by Visco for Neo Geo, came out in America first before anyone had ever played Tetris Attack.

1950
01:53:03,360 --> 01:53:09,040
The game that many of us are familiar with Tetris Attack was the North American rebranding of Paddle Dipon,

1951
01:53:09,440 --> 01:53:16,320
which actually released for SNES the following year, 1996, which is this

1952
01:53:18,080 --> 01:53:21,760
that I just showed up on on cam for those who are watching live.

1953
01:53:24,200 --> 01:53:28,880
But the truly most astounding fact about both games is that according to the O.L.R.

1954
01:53:28,880 --> 01:53:32,240
fandom page, neither one has been featured as an O.L.R.

1955
01:53:32,240 --> 01:53:33,480
classic game of the week.

1956
01:53:33,480 --> 01:53:39,200
As a fan of both games, I would love to see both are one of them honored sometime in the future.

1957
01:53:39,560 --> 01:53:40,800
Well, if wishes were fishes.

1958
01:53:41,240 --> 01:53:47,600
Anyway, Dark Sakura will consider your request and get back to you in an appropriate time frame when she feels is appropriate.

1959
01:53:48,440 --> 01:53:50,840
Which will be a very long time.

1960
01:53:52,600 --> 01:53:56,920
There was something Rob mentioned during the same episode that I found to be pretty funny.

1961
01:53:57,920 --> 01:54:03,440
He said he'd been to round one and played the latest version of Beatmania 2DX28 Beastrover.

1962
01:54:03,640 --> 01:54:07,760
Well, guess what? As of October 13th, there was no longer the latest version.

1963
01:54:07,760 --> 01:54:10,720
Beatmania 2DX29 Cast Hour is available.

1964
01:54:10,720 --> 01:54:15,560
So sorry, Rob. You have not, in fact, played the latest version lol.

1965
01:54:15,640 --> 01:54:18,600
I think somebody called that out live in chat or on Twitter or something.

1966
01:54:18,600 --> 01:54:22,720
Yeah, so that's I'm still waiting for that round one out in Roseville nearby.

1967
01:54:23,360 --> 01:54:26,000
When Misty was here, I don't think I brought this up on the show.

1968
01:54:26,240 --> 01:54:30,880
Long time fan of the show, super fan, Misty OLR was out here last weekend.

1969
01:54:30,880 --> 01:54:37,640
And she and I went on a she wanted in and out because, of course, East Coasters, they come visit, they want in and out.

1970
01:54:38,040 --> 01:54:40,400
So we went. But I was like, well, we have time.

1971
01:54:40,400 --> 01:54:43,640
So you didn't say which in and out something you do the in and out by Golf Land.

1972
01:54:43,880 --> 01:54:45,800
So we drove all the way out to that one.

1973
01:54:46,040 --> 01:54:49,000
And then I was like, while we're out here, let's point and laugh at Golf Land.

1974
01:54:49,000 --> 01:54:55,960
So we did that. And then I said, let's go to the mall because I want to see how far along the round one construction.

1975
01:54:55,960 --> 01:54:59,080
Is sadly, it doesn't look like it's quite done yet.

1976
01:54:59,080 --> 01:55:02,440
The movie theater looks like the movie theater looks like it'll open first.

1977
01:55:02,440 --> 01:55:04,320
Yes. They had the poster frames out.

1978
01:55:04,720 --> 01:55:11,760
They have the the movie theater says coming twenty twenty one and round one says coming twenty twenty two.

1979
01:55:11,760 --> 01:55:13,560
So it's not going to be this year.

1980
01:55:13,720 --> 01:55:16,200
By that time, thirtieth style will be out.

1981
01:55:17,160 --> 01:55:23,280
Anyway, and I was I was peeking in there, too, because we just went to the mall this week and I was peeking in

1982
01:55:24,280 --> 01:55:26,480
because they have doors open to see the construction.

1983
01:55:26,480 --> 01:55:28,200
It's it's all empty in there.

1984
01:55:28,200 --> 01:55:30,760
Like, I don't think they're anywhere close to opening.

1985
01:55:30,800 --> 01:55:32,160
Oh, wow. All right.

1986
01:55:32,160 --> 01:55:33,160
And I'm sorry. Sorry, Dr.

1987
01:55:33,160 --> 01:55:34,280
Zarka, you may continue.

1988
01:55:35,360 --> 01:55:38,840
OK, I'll leave you all with this.

1989
01:55:38,840 --> 01:55:43,280
I've decided for the second year in a row to do a charity Twitch stream around my birthday in mid-November,

1990
01:55:43,600 --> 01:55:48,080
during which I attempt the Ohio DDR Max 300 birthday challenge.

1991
01:55:48,400 --> 01:55:52,560
Basically, you have to clear Max 300 as many times as your age,

1992
01:55:52,800 --> 01:55:56,280
with at least half of those being on the hardest difficulty you can pass.

1993
01:55:57,160 --> 01:56:01,120
So for me this year, that means forty two times twenty one of them on expert

1994
01:56:01,520 --> 01:56:04,840
exact date charity and other details to be announced later.

1995
01:56:05,040 --> 01:56:10,600
But last year I supported Feeding America and most likely I'll be doing that again.

1996
01:56:11,000 --> 01:56:16,440
I hope that some of you will join me as long as you can stand listening to the same song forty two times.

1997
01:56:16,440 --> 01:56:19,120
I promise I'll make it as interesting as I possibly can.

1998
01:56:19,560 --> 01:56:21,960
Thanks, as usual, for the show and have a great week.

1999
01:56:22,080 --> 01:56:26,320
Why? Why are I figured it had to be why? Why are good luck?

2000
01:56:26,320 --> 01:56:32,920
I will not be joining you in participating, but I will if you're streaming or whatever, I'll happily join you to say hello.

2001
01:56:33,200 --> 01:56:37,120
So and cheer you on, because that sounds like a heart attack for me.

2002
01:56:38,160 --> 01:56:39,920
But I love that for you.

2003
01:56:39,920 --> 01:56:42,880
And I hope you're able, you know, don't push yourself.

2004
01:56:42,880 --> 01:56:45,080
Listen, your body, if your body says stop, stop.

2005
01:56:45,160 --> 01:56:49,640
That's my only that's that's going to be my my dad moment

2006
01:56:49,640 --> 01:56:52,400
there for somebody who's going to be a year younger than me.

2007
01:56:53,880 --> 01:56:56,400
All right. But good luck with it and yay for charity.

2008
01:56:57,640 --> 01:56:59,720
Next email real fast.

2009
01:56:59,720 --> 01:57:01,320
Hello, O.L.R.

2010
01:57:01,320 --> 01:57:05,440
Last week, Rob mentioned having some comfort issues when playing Metroid Dread.

2011
01:57:05,760 --> 01:57:09,600
I was wondering if you've been using the switch pro controller when you play it.

2012
01:57:09,920 --> 01:57:13,520
I just beat the game over the weekend, and at one point I switched

2013
01:57:13,560 --> 01:57:15,560
a handheld mode and played most of the Joy-Cons.

2014
01:57:15,560 --> 01:57:20,320
And yeah, it didn't feel comfy with Metroid, since it's a lot of usage of triggers.

2015
01:57:20,720 --> 01:57:24,080
It's a night and day difference to play that game using a pro controller.

2016
01:57:24,520 --> 01:57:26,320
Anyways, I hope you're enjoying it.

2017
01:57:26,320 --> 01:57:30,680
Fusion is my favorite 2D Metroid, but this game might be even better for me.

2018
01:57:31,000 --> 01:57:34,520
Now I'm just looking forward to a successor to one of my favorite games

2019
01:57:34,520 --> 01:57:37,680
ever made, Metroid Prime. Keep on playing Garth Wolf.

2020
01:57:38,080 --> 01:57:42,040
Well, you probably heard it early in the show, but I am using a pro controller,

2021
01:57:42,040 --> 01:57:44,840
specifically the Splatoon with the green and pink on the bottom.

2022
01:57:45,160 --> 01:57:49,720
And you can go about my my personal channel doesn't have the videos.

2023
01:57:49,720 --> 01:57:52,720
So you go right to the end of the last stream and you can kind of see when I'm

2024
01:57:52,720 --> 01:57:56,120
like kind of hurting and I explain it a little more what I'm going through.

2025
01:57:57,120 --> 01:58:01,680
That's very ironic because Shane, who's still in chat.

2026
01:58:01,680 --> 01:58:06,440
So correct me if I'm wrong, played the game with those regular Joy-Con controllers,

2027
01:58:06,440 --> 01:58:07,320
but they were plugged.

2028
01:58:07,320 --> 01:58:09,680
I think he just played the switch in portable most of it.

2029
01:58:09,840 --> 01:58:11,200
So you're just kind of plugged in there.

2030
01:58:11,200 --> 01:58:13,480
And he, as he said, he didn't have any problems.

2031
01:58:13,480 --> 01:58:15,960
So I think it just it really depends on the person.

2032
01:58:16,040 --> 01:58:20,880
It sounds like let's be real, probably partially the age in my case.

2033
01:58:21,280 --> 01:58:26,160
Who knows? Anyway, I'm I'm

2034
01:58:26,720 --> 01:58:28,840
I'm favorable to the game.

2035
01:58:28,840 --> 01:58:31,560
It just I had to shift my mindset a little bit.

2036
01:58:31,560 --> 01:58:36,000
It wasn't what I was expecting at first, but I appreciate what it's trying to do.

2037
01:58:36,720 --> 01:58:40,560
Again, the control, the controller thing is just that red flag emoji meme.

2038
01:58:40,560 --> 01:58:43,800
That's all. Anyhow, that's all I have to say.

2039
01:58:45,000 --> 01:58:47,680
Last email. Hi all.

2040
01:58:47,680 --> 01:58:50,720
To be a tad different with this email compared to my previous ones,

2041
01:58:50,720 --> 01:58:53,720
I figured that I would provide answers to a question that folks may have

2042
01:58:53,720 --> 01:58:59,080
regarding gaming after a stroke, but for whatever reasons haven't been asked.

2043
01:59:01,280 --> 01:59:03,360
I kind of know already, but

2044
01:59:04,360 --> 01:59:08,960
well, what it's like trying to game now that I've had a stroke compared to before.

2045
01:59:08,960 --> 01:59:13,920
Well, it's a lot harder seeing as I only have the use of my left hand.

2046
01:59:13,920 --> 01:59:17,920
Some games can easily be played one handed, like some pinball games.

2047
01:59:18,280 --> 01:59:22,320
Magic and Diablo, other games like first person shooters and fighting games.

2048
01:59:22,320 --> 01:59:25,560
I haven't figured out a way to play them effectively yet.

2049
01:59:26,040 --> 01:59:28,640
It's incredibly frustrating. Is it possible?

2050
01:59:28,640 --> 01:59:29,480
I don't know.

2051
01:59:29,480 --> 01:59:31,360
Maybe any game that can be played

2052
01:59:31,360 --> 01:59:35,160
with the mouse only or can be played with rebound keys are doable.

2053
01:59:35,560 --> 01:59:39,560
If anyone wants additional info, feel free to ask and chat tangentially.

2054
01:59:39,560 --> 01:59:41,680
Tonight might be my last dream for a while.

2055
01:59:41,680 --> 01:59:44,200
I'm moving in the morning and I don't know if.

2056
01:59:45,760 --> 01:59:48,960
I don't what's an NRE place has Internet.

2057
01:59:50,960 --> 01:59:54,360
So. Yeah, ask. Ask.

2058
01:59:55,880 --> 01:59:57,400
No one really.

2059
01:59:59,600 --> 02:00:02,040
Again, sorry, you're going through that.

2060
02:00:02,040 --> 02:00:04,040
But and the moving and everything.

2061
02:00:04,040 --> 02:00:04,880
Good luck with the move.

2062
02:00:04,880 --> 02:00:07,400
Moving is a pain, but good luck with all that.

2063
02:00:07,640 --> 02:00:09,280
We're not going to be here next week anyway.

2064
02:00:09,280 --> 02:00:11,520
So it gives you two weeks to find a Wi-Fi to steal.

2065
02:00:11,520 --> 02:00:15,600
So I hope that works out in your favor for what that is worth.

2066
02:00:15,600 --> 02:00:18,080
I think it meant for streaming.

2067
02:00:18,080 --> 02:00:22,520
Oh, well, yeah, just to get get a Wi-Fi connection to stream the show.

2068
02:00:24,200 --> 02:00:27,920
Just to do his streaming, I think. Oh, oh, oh, yeah, yeah.

2069
02:00:28,160 --> 02:00:29,840
That might be a difficult for sure.

2070
02:00:29,840 --> 02:00:32,200
Yeah. So. All right.

2071
02:00:32,200 --> 02:00:33,480
But thanks for the email, nonetheless.

2072
02:00:33,480 --> 02:00:39,000
And I always like to hear from gamers perspectives from their shoes.

2073
02:00:39,440 --> 02:00:43,120
You know, we've heard from over the years gamers in other countries

2074
02:00:43,120 --> 02:00:45,480
who it's not as easy to buy video games.

2075
02:00:45,720 --> 02:00:50,120
We've heard from gamers who are blind and, you know, have faced

2076
02:00:50,120 --> 02:00:51,160
those type of challenges.

2077
02:00:51,160 --> 02:00:53,600
And we get to hear about some of those types of workarounds.

2078
02:00:53,920 --> 02:00:56,600
I always like to kind of hear from gamers that make us kind of stop

2079
02:00:56,600 --> 02:00:59,440
and think and kind of go like, oh, this is this is,

2080
02:01:00,640 --> 02:01:02,960
you know, gaming is for everyone, right?

2081
02:01:02,960 --> 02:01:07,000
So I kind of like to hear like how some people, the lengths

2082
02:01:07,000 --> 02:01:10,040
that they'll go to make sure that they get the gaming experiences.

2083
02:01:10,040 --> 02:01:12,760
I think that's a good thing for us all to be aware of, too.

2084
02:01:13,320 --> 02:01:16,440
I still say look for switch controls like next switch.

2085
02:01:18,000 --> 02:01:21,760
Because they make those for quadriplegics.

2086
02:01:22,480 --> 02:01:25,560
And I know people who are like

2087
02:01:25,880 --> 02:01:29,920
doom masters and play with their neck.

2088
02:01:31,600 --> 02:01:35,880
Only She-Hulk in chat reminding us Microsoft has a great controller

2089
02:01:35,880 --> 02:01:37,320
for that as well.

2090
02:01:37,320 --> 02:01:39,880
So that's yes, that's a great call out, too.

2091
02:01:39,920 --> 02:01:43,120
So well, and I think that's any Apple product comes with switch control

2092
02:01:43,120 --> 02:01:45,400
built in. Hmm. Cool. So.

2093
02:01:47,080 --> 02:01:51,400
All right. Oh, I didn't check to see if we had a green room.

2094
02:01:51,400 --> 02:01:53,720
OK, we don't have any callers that want to call in tonight.

2095
02:01:55,520 --> 02:01:58,720
But I think we're at about 830, which is usually would be wrapping up anyway.

2096
02:01:58,720 --> 02:02:00,280
The podcast is going to seem a little smaller,

2097
02:02:00,280 --> 02:02:02,680
but that's because, of course, we got a late start tonight.

2098
02:02:02,680 --> 02:02:04,800
We didn't start till 630 because the power outage.

2099
02:02:04,800 --> 02:02:07,200
So thanks for that up.

2100
02:02:07,200 --> 02:02:09,560
Let me quickly, though, before we completely wrap up tonight,

2101
02:02:09,560 --> 02:02:11,520
check in with any last minute stories, Loki.

2102
02:02:13,040 --> 02:02:15,520
Just that Sony has threatened

2103
02:02:15,520 --> 02:02:19,520
dbrand with legal action because they were offering those alternative

2104
02:02:19,840 --> 02:02:23,800
black face plates for the PlayStation five.

2105
02:02:23,800 --> 02:02:27,360
And while dbrand

2106
02:02:28,000 --> 02:02:30,920
did mention that the texture that were on those face

2107
02:02:30,920 --> 02:02:34,080
plates was familiar, but legally distinct.

2108
02:02:34,120 --> 02:02:36,520
Apparently, it wasn't as legally distinct as they thought.

2109
02:02:36,760 --> 02:02:40,640
So, yeah, those have been taken down and they made a shit post

2110
02:02:40,760 --> 02:02:44,320
about it on Reddit instead of, you know, responding to Sony.

2111
02:02:45,560 --> 02:02:48,040
Obi Wan Jabroni in chat says, I have those plates.

2112
02:02:48,480 --> 02:02:49,160
How do you like them?

2113
02:02:49,160 --> 02:02:52,040
Was it worth it? Legit, curious.

2114
02:02:52,040 --> 02:02:54,200
I don't even have PlayStation five still.

2115
02:02:54,200 --> 02:02:55,920
It's probably not going to happen this holiday,

2116
02:02:55,920 --> 02:02:58,960
but probably next summer, I'll end up getting one.

2117
02:02:58,960 --> 02:03:00,160
That's about the right time frame.

2118
02:03:00,160 --> 02:03:03,160
So anything else, Loki?

2119
02:03:04,720 --> 02:03:06,640
No, that's it. All right.

2120
02:03:06,640 --> 02:03:08,840
Well, then let me take an opportunity to thank everybody

2121
02:03:08,840 --> 02:03:11,320
for supporting Orange Launch Radio and coming out,

2122
02:03:11,320 --> 02:03:13,400
whether you were listening live here on Sunday night

2123
02:03:13,400 --> 02:03:17,440
and stuck through the power outage and all that stuff to actually

2124
02:03:19,320 --> 02:03:21,440
be here live with us tonight. I appreciate that.

2125
02:03:21,800 --> 02:03:22,600
Thank you. Thank you.

2126
02:03:22,600 --> 02:03:24,400
Thanks to my hosts for being patient.

2127
02:03:24,400 --> 02:03:28,560
Thanks to Bobby Blackwell for vamping in the face of that silly power outage.

2128
02:03:28,720 --> 02:03:32,040
I did get a nice reply from social media person for the power company here.

2129
02:03:32,240 --> 02:03:36,840
So, yeah, they said, I hope you were able to do your show.

2130
02:03:36,840 --> 02:03:39,800
Sorry, we're working to get it done or something like that.

2131
02:03:39,800 --> 02:03:43,560
So, you know, at least with them, like with Smud,

2132
02:03:43,560 --> 02:03:46,680
like I had to say that their customer service has actually been pretty great

2133
02:03:46,680 --> 02:03:51,000
because we've had it before where they will call me when the power is out.

2134
02:03:51,000 --> 02:03:54,120
They're like, hey, we know that your power is out, you know, like

2135
02:03:54,120 --> 02:03:55,280
and I wasn't even home.

2136
02:03:55,280 --> 02:03:58,680
I was like, oh, OK, it's going to be restored at this time, you know.

2137
02:03:59,320 --> 02:04:02,400
So they preemptively call, whereas like if Comcast was out,

2138
02:04:02,400 --> 02:04:04,200
they'd be just like, we don't exist.

2139
02:04:04,200 --> 02:04:06,560
I don't I don't have a problem with the power company here.

2140
02:04:06,560 --> 02:04:07,320
They are pretty good.

2141
02:04:07,320 --> 02:04:10,480
I'm I'm very happy with who we have compared to the alternative

2142
02:04:10,480 --> 02:04:12,720
that the rest of the state has most of the rest of the state has.

2143
02:04:13,680 --> 02:04:17,000
So and I'll I'll I'll send a nice reply to their social media person.

2144
02:04:17,000 --> 02:04:20,680
It's just frustrating that the power was out on Monday

2145
02:04:20,680 --> 02:04:23,640
and then the power was out again right before O.L.R.

2146
02:04:23,640 --> 02:04:26,800
like it just we had to replace food in the fridge because we lost power

2147
02:04:26,800 --> 02:04:29,680
for 12 hours. So, yeah, anyway.

2148
02:04:31,000 --> 02:04:36,480
But I get that the wind dictated that not necessarily the power company.

2149
02:04:36,480 --> 02:04:38,600
It is what it is. All right.

2150
02:04:38,600 --> 02:04:41,240
Anyway, I was going to give the rest of my spiel, but Dark Soccer,

2151
02:04:41,240 --> 02:04:43,280
I know you need a little extra time to prepare for your stream.

2152
02:04:43,280 --> 02:04:45,880
So I thought I'd let you go ahead and give your exit now

2153
02:04:45,880 --> 02:04:47,880
and then I'll give the rest of spiel and sign off for the night.

2154
02:04:47,880 --> 02:04:49,040
So Dark Soccer, any final thoughts?

2155
02:04:50,240 --> 02:04:52,600
I do have certain people that I would like to share

2156
02:04:52,600 --> 02:04:55,200
my community with next week while I am gone.

2157
02:04:55,600 --> 02:05:00,560
So I will be listing them and letting people know.

2158
02:05:00,760 --> 02:05:05,400
But they're people who I who I trust to take good care of y'all.

2159
02:05:06,880 --> 02:05:10,880
All right. And stay tuned for some dead by daylight, because I have a vendetta.

2160
02:05:12,240 --> 02:05:16,360
All right. I have to I have to just argue against MMR before

2161
02:05:17,480 --> 02:05:20,880
Barista Witch comes out on Tuesday.

2162
02:05:20,880 --> 02:05:24,280
What's her name? Michaela? Like that's such a.

2163
02:05:24,280 --> 02:05:25,200
Post-millennial.

2164
02:05:25,200 --> 02:05:28,480
I thought you liked Michaela because she is you.

2165
02:05:28,880 --> 02:05:33,120
She is me. Don't get me wrong, but people are going to be toxic as shit with her.

2166
02:05:33,200 --> 02:05:34,840
I know. I know.

2167
02:05:34,840 --> 02:05:38,160
But in her nickname now in all the circles in any way is Barista Witch.

2168
02:05:38,160 --> 02:05:40,160
So because that's exactly what she is.

2169
02:05:40,200 --> 02:05:42,160
She is a barista and a witch.

2170
02:05:43,360 --> 02:05:45,520
All right. We'll see you in two weeks.

2171
02:05:46,560 --> 02:05:49,360
All right. See you in the cloud, in the cloud, in the fog.

2172
02:05:49,840 --> 02:05:54,840
All right. Let me give the rest of my spiel here and then we'll get around to final, final thoughts.

2173
02:05:55,200 --> 02:05:59,920
So first off, thank you guys so much for downloading or listening to our podcast live tonight.

2174
02:06:00,120 --> 02:06:03,400
If you enjoyed what you heard here at OLR, tell a friend or two, help us spread the word.

2175
02:06:03,560 --> 02:06:07,440
We are the show where every gamer has a voice, but we need the voices here to get out on air

2176
02:06:08,440 --> 02:06:10,440
to have more voices.

2177
02:06:10,440 --> 02:06:14,440
We have a shop if you're interested in that, vognetwork.com slash shop.

2178
02:06:14,440 --> 02:06:18,440
If you would like to pick up some OLR merchandise or possibly some fog network merchandise,

2179
02:06:18,440 --> 02:06:25,440
a Bobby Black Wolf mug, whatever, whatever tickles your fancy, check that out over vognetwork.com slash shop.

2180
02:06:25,440 --> 02:06:30,440
Otherwise, we'll be back in two weeks. We will not be here next week.

2181
02:06:30,440 --> 02:06:35,440
Dark Sakura talked about at the beginning of the show, she has some personal issues she's going to tend to

2182
02:06:35,440 --> 02:06:38,440
in, in the place where she grew up and I'm going to Disneyland.

2183
02:06:38,440 --> 02:06:41,440
So two, two very different reasons to not be here.

2184
02:06:41,440 --> 02:06:45,440
Loki will be using next. What are you going to do next week with a week off, Loki?

2185
02:06:45,440 --> 02:06:46,440
Play Minecraft.

2186
02:06:46,440 --> 02:06:49,440
I was gonna say play Minecraft, work on videos, something like that?

2187
02:06:49,440 --> 02:06:50,440
Probably, yeah.

2188
02:06:50,440 --> 02:06:53,440
You could do a stream. I bet Bobby would pass the viewers to you.

2189
02:06:53,440 --> 02:06:55,440
I could do a stream.

2190
02:06:55,440 --> 02:06:56,440
Think about it.

2191
02:06:56,440 --> 02:06:58,440
I could do a stream. That is a possibility.

2192
02:06:58,440 --> 02:07:01,440
DDR in the garage might work. We'll see.

2193
02:07:01,440 --> 02:07:03,440
Haven't played DDR in a while.

2194
02:07:03,440 --> 02:07:05,440
I was thinking about it the other day too.

2195
02:07:05,440 --> 02:07:09,440
Get some inspiration from that YYRE email.

2196
02:07:09,440 --> 02:07:11,440
Yeah.

2197
02:07:11,440 --> 02:07:13,440
All right. We'll see.

2198
02:07:13,440 --> 02:07:15,440
We'll see. All right. Let's see.

2199
02:07:15,440 --> 02:07:17,440
So we'll be back in two weeks.

2200
02:07:17,440 --> 02:07:21,440
So Loki, Loki, we won't see you for three weeks because

2201
02:07:21,440 --> 02:07:25,440
you're, you're not going to be here on Halloween night because obviously you have children

2202
02:07:25,440 --> 02:07:27,440
and you're obligated to take the children trick or treating.

2203
02:07:27,440 --> 02:07:29,440
So I totally understand that.

2204
02:07:29,440 --> 02:07:32,440
But yeah, good luck with all your Minecraft production

2205
02:07:32,440 --> 02:07:35,440
and I'm excited for you with all these updates and all that stuff.

2206
02:07:35,440 --> 02:07:38,440
So yeah, any final thoughts for our listeners tonight?

2207
02:07:39,440 --> 02:07:42,440
No, just hoping to have another video out this week.

2208
02:07:42,440 --> 02:07:45,440
Lots of updates to my base I'm doing.

2209
02:07:45,440 --> 02:07:48,440
It's all the Ninjago, Lego Ninjago theme.

2210
02:07:48,440 --> 02:07:54,440
So I've been basing my first section off of the actual official Lego Ninjago city set

2211
02:07:54,440 --> 02:07:56,440
and it looks pretty awesome.

2212
02:07:56,440 --> 02:07:57,440
Awesome.

2213
02:07:57,440 --> 02:08:00,440
My final thought, I'll plug my channel over twitch.tv slash Rob Roberts.

2214
02:08:00,440 --> 02:08:02,440
I've been pretty good for two weeks now.

2215
02:08:02,440 --> 02:08:04,440
Like I've gotten in at least three streams a week after.

2216
02:08:04,440 --> 02:08:07,440
I have hit one of the milestones for partner finally.

2217
02:08:07,440 --> 02:08:10,440
Finally. I've been like doing this for a long time.

2218
02:08:10,440 --> 02:08:12,440
No, it's not the viewer one.

2219
02:08:12,440 --> 02:08:14,440
That's clearly the hardest one to get.

2220
02:08:14,440 --> 02:08:16,440
But I have done 12 different streams in the past month.

2221
02:08:16,440 --> 02:08:19,440
So follow me over twitch.tv slash Rob Roberts.

2222
02:08:19,440 --> 02:08:21,440
I'm really close to 500 followers.

2223
02:08:21,440 --> 02:08:22,440
That's kind of a landmark.

2224
02:08:22,440 --> 02:08:24,440
So yeah, I would appreciate that.

2225
02:08:24,440 --> 02:08:26,440
But it's all good either way.

2226
02:08:26,440 --> 02:08:28,440
We'll see you back here at Vaga Network in two weeks.

2227
02:08:28,440 --> 02:08:30,440
Bobby will be here next week though.

2228
02:08:30,440 --> 02:08:35,440
So, you know, come come here at your usual time at 5 Pacific 8 Eastern

2229
02:08:35,440 --> 02:08:36,440
and he'll be here to entertain.

2230
02:08:36,440 --> 02:08:39,440
He can do another jumbo show potentially next week.

2231
02:08:39,440 --> 02:08:40,440
So there is that.

2232
02:08:40,440 --> 02:08:41,440
That's it.

2233
02:08:41,440 --> 02:08:42,440
Have a great week.

2234
02:08:42,440 --> 02:08:44,440
Happy gaming.

2235
02:08:44,440 --> 02:08:45,440
Happy Halloween.

2236
02:08:45,440 --> 02:08:46,440
We'll be back on Halloween night.

2237
02:08:46,440 --> 02:08:49,440
Happy Rocky Horror season to my friends who are participating with that

2238
02:08:49,440 --> 02:08:53,440
and getting their first show back like I am in a very long time.

2239
02:08:53,440 --> 02:08:55,440
That is going to be awesome.

2240
02:08:55,440 --> 02:08:58,440
And yeah, be safe out there.

2241
02:08:58,440 --> 02:09:00,440
Make good choices.

2242
02:09:00,440 --> 02:09:01,440
Wear your mask.

2243
02:09:01,440 --> 02:09:02,440
Get vaccinated.

2244
02:09:02,440 --> 02:09:03,440
That's it, everybody.

2245
02:09:03,440 --> 02:09:04,440
Have a great night.

2246
