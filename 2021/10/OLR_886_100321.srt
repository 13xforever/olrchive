1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,600
Oh Konami, we wouldn't be here without you and we lament your continued decline in everything

2
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:18,920
except Imani. But now you're teasing new life in your largest franchises? Do I want

3
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:24,560
classic Konami remakes? Yes. Do I want new titles of classic Konami franchises? Castlevania,

4
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:30,280
Metal Gear, Silent Hill? Let's reserve judgment. This is the headline about the publisher that

5
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:33,560
catalyzed our collective. Now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Sommers and

6
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:36,440
Loki to tell you more about this and the rest of the week's gaming news. Starting right

7
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:38,440
now on the show where every gamer has a voice.

8
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:45,720
Hello my friends out there on the internet. Welcome back to another week of the show where

9
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:52,600
every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio and we are live once again with episode

10
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:59,840
number 886 of our show for tonight, October the 3rd of 2021. I can't believe it's spooky

11
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:05,040
season already, but happy Halloween a little early. My name is Rob Roberts and I'm here

12
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:10,520
with you every week and joined by my co-hosts. Say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Sommers.

13
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:15,040
You know Halloween season started on August 1st, right? Fair enough. Well, certainly by

14
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:19,440
the time I was enjoying a pumpkin spice latte, was it spooky season? And that was like Dragon

15
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:24,280
Con. That was like Labor Day. I have still not had one. Oh, you're missing out. Although

16
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:29,160
I'm not missing out. Yes, you are. As I've said on a previous episode, the apple drink's

17
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:36,880
pretty good too. I didn't have that because I hate caramel. Just get it without the caramel.

18
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:42,840
No, I like it in the chai. It's actually, it's too strong actually. It's too sweet.

19
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:46,840
So I'd have to have them do half as much. A lot of those, like even the pumpkin spice

20
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:54,760
latte, the thing I absolutely loathe about it now is that it is so sweet. I cannot, I

21
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:58,720
can't stomach it. It makes me nauseous. Try the cold brew with the foam because when

22
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:02,920
they mix together, the bitterness of the cold brew kind of helps I think with that. It's

23
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:05,920
a less sweet drink. Cold brew isn't supposed to be very bitter though. It does. It is to

24
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:10,960
me. Well, it's coffee, so it tastes a little bitter to me. The thing about cold brew, okay,

25
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:15,120
we're getting into coffee science and better put that aside. It's coffee talk. Let's talk

26
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:23,640
about a pumpkin spice latte. A cold brew is neither cold nor a brew. Discuss. It really

27
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:31,600
isn't a brew. It's like more like a steep. All right. Say hello as well to neither tech

28
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:38,800
nor master. Say hello to Loki, everybody. Hello. How are you, Loki? I don't like the

29
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:44,520
cold brew coffees. You don't really like coffee at all, do you? I'll drink like a wine mocha.

30
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:53,040
That's about it. So you don't like real chocolate either? I don't really like a lot of things.

31
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:57,920
I'm excited because Alan has to go run an errand. So he said on his way back he would

32
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:03,840
go by and I, especially if you're West Coast, like Northwest Coast, you know, this place

33
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:08,120
is crack. He's going by Dutch brothers on the way back. And that's like fucking love

34
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:13,720
Dutch to hell with Starbucks. Honestly, they're not paying me to say that. I love I always

35
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:17,460
get like the double mocha thing from them, even if it's going to make me super sick.

36
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:22,200
That much chocolate makes me happy. My favorite part of Dutch brothers is how they they make

37
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:27,440
their their locations way too small and don't account for any sort of traffic concern. Oh,

38
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:33,920
yes. Always a disaster. Everything everywhere. They're just a big pain in the ass. And so

39
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:39,880
it's just. Yay, Dutch brothers. And then everybody like has a stupid stickers on their car. And

40
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:44,400
it's like, what is this role? How do we take it? How do we take the concept of a Trader

41
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:51,000
Joe's parking lot and make it worse? Yeah. Yeah. Dutch brothers and Trader Joe's are

42
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:57,080
the same people. And I swear, it's just like the same crowd. My wife is part of that crowd.

43
00:03:57,080 --> 00:04:02,160
I don't think she doesn't go to Dutch Brothers, but she sees the Trader Joe's crowd. And yeah,

44
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:06,140
they're special. All right. Anyway, we're here to talk about games, not about Dutch

45
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:11,460
Brothers and Trader Joe's, although you know, by the way, I bet Loki would like my dinner.

46
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:16,500
What did you have for dinner? It is steak and shells and cheese. Oh, good. Yum. I'd

47
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:22,040
like your dinner. Yeah, that was better than my, you know, one on the two month reminders

48
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:26,860
that McDonald's food is not good. We're good today. But I did it. It was just I didn't

49
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:33,180
have time. I wanted to go all the way down the Rancho to get this place they have. It's

50
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:38,260
like steak sandwiches, but they have like a beef dip there. That's pretty good. I want

51
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:43,700
to try that. But that's like all the way over in the Rancho. Or my other option was I want

52
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:48,160
to go to Burger King. But once again, for some stupid reason, we have a black hole of

53
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:53,840
Burger King in our area. And the closest Burger King is like 20 minutes away, one way or the

54
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:57,380
other from me. I was gonna say there's one like right near I mean, not to give away my

55
00:04:57,380 --> 00:05:02,500
address on it, but there's one not far from the studio. So yeah, one of them's Yeah, it's

56
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:07,900
just I don't know for some reason. They don't have Burger King's around me. They have everything

57
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:13,940
else but not Burger King. Well, did get me chickie nugs from from the evil w come back

58
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:20,860
to this point for some good old times and you can go by Burger King on your way. Sure.

59
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:27,020
All right. The only fast food I really eat anymore is Del Taco. The one here. All right,

60
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:33,660
we gotta get to games. Look, fine episode. Jim boys is probably maybe you know what,

61
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:37,380
we haven't done a channel point reward in a long time. I think it was I think it was

62
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:41,860
Bobby's turn and then it just didn't happen. But he's gonna be taking a little time off.

63
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:44,780
So maybe we'll just have to do one again. And maybe we'll have to raise the channel

64
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:50,140
points for an all food like that, like the purpose will be orange lounge foodie. Oh,

65
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:54,420
and we will talk about nothing but food. I will have like 20 topics on food ready to

66
00:05:54,420 --> 00:06:01,620
go and we'll we'll have food eleganza. Exactly. Category is food, all food and we'll play

67
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:06,380
we'll play power washing sim in the background just for the hell of it. We need to fucking

68
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:13,180
talk about power washing sim. But first, our kickoff topic for tonight. Let's go to a story

69
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:16,540
about Twitch. Well, why don't why don't we be self referential since we are doing our

70
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:20,620
show on Twitch, because we do tape live every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific nine o'clock

71
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:26,580
Eastern at the voice of geeks network, twitch.tv slash v o g network. Usually I would say we're

72
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:30,420
right after the Bobby Blackwell show. But as he announced earlier this evening, he's going to be

73
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:35,700
taking an unspecified amount of time off. I am having fingers and toes crossed the and full faith

74
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:41,100
that it's just going to be one week. Although the reality is it could be a little longer, but we're

75
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:45,060
just we're just going to err on the side of one week. And so we'll just we'll he'll just be taking

76
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:49,220
a little vacation and then be back in two weeks. That's that's where I'm going to set my mind and

77
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:54,340
positivity too. And if it doesn't turn out that way, then we'll deal with it later. All right. But

78
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:58,580
anyhow, Twitch, our kickoff topics about Twitch, let's get into it on Loki, you want to kind of

79
00:06:58,580 --> 00:06:59,220
start us off here?

80
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:08,260
I would be the the thing we linked is the wrong story. So I am looking it up right now. But yeah,

81
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:14,620
basically, they've added some more functionality to Twitch chat to basically combat those bot

82
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:16,540
raids and whatnot. So

83
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:18,260
the verified account thing.

84
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:26,620
Yeah, so that's nice that they're finally doing some of that stuff. Is it enough? I guess we'll

85
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:27,500
wait and see.

86
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:33,020
It's been kind of interesting, though, in some of my other friends channels. I haven't seen as

87
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:38,980
much. Certainly I haven't seen the Haas show up as much in the last couple of days. The hose.

88
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:45,580
I've seen the hose show up just one or two here or there, but drop a follow. And I think part of

89
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:46,100
the problem

90
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:51,060
they're banned immediately. Well, I don't when I go to that's for sure. When I go to know when I

91
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:55,940
go to ban them, it says user doesn't exist. Oh, well, that's nice, I guess. But they started

92
00:07:55,940 --> 00:08:03,940
putting words in front of hose. So the hose requests or Yeah, fun or, you know, crap.

93
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:09,140
So I don't know what those clowns are doing. But, you know, I do see them come through once in a

94
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:14,980
while. So but but it's nice that, you know, we can set the things on the chat. And we can set the

95
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:21,300
things with with that. But we can't change the follow because I would turn on the follow thing.

96
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:25,940
You know, and I realized that can kind of damage your follow base. But I I'm whatever like I would

97
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:30,020
turn it on so that you have to have a verified phone number to be able to follow. I don't think

98
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:33,860
it's that big of a deal that they're asking for. And definitely raid. That's the other thing.

99
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:38,580
They're not they're not doing anything the actual like hate raid when you get a bunch of these,

100
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:43,860
you know, hose to suddenly raid and their icons and stuff that are coming through are all

101
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:51,700
disgusting images that that's not really done yet. But I for what it's worth, I haven't personally

102
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:56,500
seen it happen to a channel in a little bit. So everything I'm hearing is anecdotal. And I don't

103
00:08:56,500 --> 00:09:01,540
know if it's been happening since and maybe chat. You can set me straight because y'all are or set

104
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:06,660
me gay, whatever you prefer. But send me in the chat whichever way I should be going over at

105
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:12,580
twitch.tv slash vogue network on if you've seen one of these in the past couple days or heard

106
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:16,900
about this happening since Twitch actually did these changes. That's what I would be curious

107
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:23,220
about. Yeah, I'm fifth dream. Oh, sorry, go ahead. Is that something that you toggle on in your

108
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:28,660
stream manager? Because I'm not seeing it in mine. It is there. It's kind of you have to go on to

109
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:36,100
your dashboard settings and moderation and then or mods can do it via chat manage moderation settings.

110
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:41,380
And then you can toggle the phone or email verification required for all accounts first

111
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:46,820
time chatters, chatters with the couch is less than and they have like certain criteria up from

112
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:53,060
one day to six months, or even like one hour chatters following for less than pre filled up,

113
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:57,860
they have like 10 minutes, 30 minutes, all the way up to three months. So you can add all that.

114
00:09:58,580 --> 00:10:05,220
You can also exempt VIP subscribers and mods and whatnot. I think that's good that they have all

115
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:12,340
that stuff in there definitely will slow them down. Yeah, but and just some free advice you

116
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:17,700
didn't ask for for Twitch streamers and up and coming Twitch streamers. Never ever, ever, ever

117
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:23,700
set your channel to followers only mode, unless it's a result of one of these raids. And it's the

118
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:28,100
only thing you can do about it. Hopefully these options will make it so that you don't need to do

119
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:34,660
that. But I would say like setting your it so so obviously, you know, because I don't want to get

120
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:39,060
the email that's like, you're insensitive and rude, Rob, because you haven't had to deal with

121
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:42,980
as many of these and I have to turn it on. Okay, yeah, if you're doing it as a response to these,

122
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:47,460
I'm sorry, you have to do that. Because that is one of the worst things you can do to your channel

123
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:52,980
to stifle growth, in my opinion. Never turn on followers only mode because you're not encouraging

124
00:10:52,980 --> 00:11:00,180
discussion with new potential awesome people. And then you can't like- Following is free.

125
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:04,820
Yeah, following is free. Well, yeah, you should follow channels that you're watching. But,

126
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:07,860
you know, sometimes people want to have a little bit of engagement or whatever it is.

127
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:14,020
I just think turning on followers only mode, you're putting up a wall and then somebody just,

128
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:18,020
you know, it's like, I don't want to follow, I'll just go to a different channel. You know,

129
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:22,740
I'm not that I'm not I'm not that motivated to say something. You want to encourage the

130
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:29,060
participation as easy as possible. You don't want to make it even one button and an alert,

131
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:34,260
which some people don't want to have the alerts. I follow channels purposely when they're not live

132
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:40,420
so that I don't do an alert so that it's just like outside. This is what it is. So-

133
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:46,100
See, I like when people follow or sub while I can see it so that

134
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:51,060
I can give them a shout out and thank them. Sure. Not everybody wants to be seen though.

135
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:56,660
You know, it just depends on the preference of the viewer and so forth.

136
00:11:56,660 --> 00:11:59,940
Yeah, but sometimes it makes the streamer feel good.

137
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:02,420
Sure. To witness it and know that it's happened.

138
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:07,940
Let's see. Mike Deft in chat is kind of agreeing, saying, yeah, people do tend to go away

139
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:14,180
if they see an obstacle, even as simple as just a click. And Mike Deft continues, ads suck more

140
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:21,060
though. Yeah, I really think that feature that Twitch added where it automatically plays ads.

141
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:25,060
I mean, if you're dropping an ad because you're going to pee anyway and you're not going to be

142
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:29,780
there for two minutes, that's one thing. But the one that like I've been to channels now that just

143
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:35,140
automatically play the ads every 30 minutes. And it's so like I tune right out. Like if I feel

144
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:38,500
like they're talking and I'm missing something, I forget it. I'll just go somewhere else.

145
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:44,340
But I won't like if somebody's like it because I've done it. I've run an ad when I've gotten up

146
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:48,580
to pee because I know nothing's going to happen on my channel for two minutes, but an AFK screen.

147
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:52,020
So it's like, all right, whatever. I'm not like hurting anything or stifling discussion.

148
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:57,140
So and I'm getting rid of pre-roll ads, which is another important thing. So,

149
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:05,380
well, I actually do that when when I go for one of my many bathroom breaks, I usually run an ad.

150
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:11,060
Sure. But that makes sense to do it. And make two whole cents. Yeah. Let's see,

151
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:16,020
Zen Monkey 11 in chat says they should have a hide button for subs so they can choose to be seen or

152
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:21,620
not. You know, technically that exists because you only actually push the sub notice through

153
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:25,620
when you check that bot. And some people have said, Rob, why don't you why didn't you read

154
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:29,620
my shout out at the end of the stream? I didn't see it. You didn't you didn't let that little

155
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:36,660
chat thing go through to put a gun to your head to announce it in chat. Like every time I like

156
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:42,100
close, close, close. No, listen, you do it. You're going to announce your subscription. Yeah,

157
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:46,740
that's the other thing is I'm like, how did you get that to go away? Because I never can.

158
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:52,580
No, it's crazy. Yeah, it's like, it's like, sorry, you can't do anything until you announce your sub.

159
00:13:52,580 --> 00:14:01,300
It's like, okay, thanks. Bonds 006 in chat says I followed 26 channels lurk in 22 of them. I'm

160
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:07,300
tuning in to give the person the numbers. I literally lurk in 90% of dark soccer's DVD games.

161
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:11,140
Not to speak for dark soccer when she's right there, but I'm gonna guess she doesn't mind if

162
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:16,900
you lurk because it's still a view. So yeah, yeah. So and because that's how I feel too.

163
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:24,180
And again, view numbers are weird anyway. Like I it'll say three people are watching and then

164
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:30,660
it's got like 50 people lurking. Yeah, that's why that's why I just learned to stop looking

165
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:36,420
at those numbers like because they're not right half the time anyway. But I would also say a

166
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:40,980
really big no no as a streamer. Do not shout out random people in chat that you know are there.

167
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:47,620
Like, there are very specific circumstances that might be okay. Like, for example, like, you know,

168
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:52,340
oh, we're gonna bring up Pokemon is Shane in chat. Let me look at the chat list. Oh,

169
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:57,060
that's different. Because, you know, we've been friends for years and you know, whatever,

170
00:14:57,060 --> 00:15:01,300
he knows I'm going to call him out. If I ever bring up a Pokemon topic, and that's a compliment.

171
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:05,860
But again, sometimes people just want to lurk, they just want to idle and they don't necessarily

172
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:09,940
want to participate. They just are having the content in the background. So to call them out

173
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:16,340
can always feel really awkward. So anyway, all right. Um, anyway, this was not unsolicited Twitch

174
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:22,180
advice hour, it was responding to some of these news items. But I think there's more right, Loki?

175
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:24,500
Well, it did help me out, by the way. Thanks. Thanks, Loki.

176
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:32,500
So there is also more and this is kind of, I don't necessarily like where this is going,

177
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:39,300
but it's basically this new service that they're testing right now. It's called boosting.

178
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:48,980
And what it basically does is allows you to pay for recommendations to other people. So for

179
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:55,620
example, they have like a screenshot here showing that they're paying about 297 for 3000

180
00:15:55,620 --> 00:16:01,700
recommendations. So I guess it blasted out to it pops maybe your channel on their recommended

181
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:08,500
feed on the side there. I'm not really sure what that's about. But yeah, apparently it varies in

182
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:14,980
cost depending on how many recommendations you're looking to Facebook does that.

183
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:22,580
I don't necessarily like that. That's kind of pay to win at that point. But I don't know.

184
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:27,300
I think that's exactly what Facebook does for your for personal pages.

185
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:32,740
The response on Twitter has been very interesting to this because I've seen a lot of streamer pals

186
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:37,780
and friends that are tweeting like, if you are a fan of my stream, please do not do this.

187
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:45,460
I'm not so sure I'm apt to tell people not to do this. Because at the end of the day,

188
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:50,340
it's your money, spend it how you want. If you're going to spend money on a mediocre way

189
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:55,300
to boost the visibility of VOG Network or one of our personal streams, of course, I'm not going to

190
00:16:55,300 --> 00:17:02,500
stop you. Like, maybe it'll work. Yay, who knows? But I think there's just a lot of us going, we

191
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:06,980
don't get a cut of that. And so there's a lot of us going, the money would be better spent on a sub

192
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:12,580
or biddies because we actually get some of that money. And we'll spend it on advertising in other

193
00:17:12,580 --> 00:17:17,860
ways like buying a booth at a convention where we can talk to people face to face or getting more

194
00:17:17,860 --> 00:17:23,620
flyers or merchandise made that we can take to conventions and other live spaces. I think that

195
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:30,180
is kind of why people are urging people to go the other direction with this. It would be nice maybe

196
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:36,100
if Twitch had a boost slash, you know, donate or tip the streamer type of thing. And then maybe

197
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:42,020
people wouldn't feel so opposed. But again, I'm not going to take a hard line on that. If you feel

198
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:47,460
generous enough to boost VOG Network, again, I don't think it's the best way you could spend the

199
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:54,100
money. But I'll be curious if it works. And I'll be thankful that you tried, I guess. So that's

200
00:17:54,100 --> 00:18:01,860
how I kind of feel. Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, that's why I don't like the Discord Nitro system.

201
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:07,540
Just let us pay to get the boosted perks instead of forcing our users to do so. Yeah, I'm not a

202
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:12,660
huge, huge fan of that either. But I do like that a server can be boosted a pretty decent amount

203
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:19,700
with just one person. And so the VOG Network Discord is boosted thanks to yours truly. I think

204
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:25,060
somebody else actually boosted so I can't take all the credit anymore. But maybe Bobby did it too,

205
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:31,620
actually. But yeah, I mean, I was the first I know that that got us boosted there. So I mean,

206
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:36,740
it's gonna take like 50 boosts to get to the next level. Yeah, don't do that. Don't don't spend the

207
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:41,700
money to do that. Like yeah, I agree with Bobby. Let us pay to do it. And maybe we will. Who knows?

208
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:46,340
Yeah, Mike Deff says I'd rather give you guys the money directly. Thank you. We'll take it.

209
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:51,300
Although remember, we don't ask for money to do this show. Like all the tips and things you guys

210
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:55,940
give. And I did notice the hype train earlier. Thank you guys very much for that. You really,

211
00:18:55,940 --> 00:19:01,460
really don't have to do those types of things. But since you did, we'll use the money to keep

212
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:05,540
our business legitimate and to help spread the word and try to grow our family a little bit.

213
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:09,300
And, you know, it'll be nice when conventions come back and we can do that more.

214
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:13,860
Dude, no more selling the black market knockoff video games?

215
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:18,420
Well, that's kind of what Loki's doing with Pixel Poops.

216
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:21,780
Yeah, but that's a legit game.

217
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:22,280
It is.

218
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:27,380
I mean, like, you know, 50 million in one cartridges.

219
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:30,260
Yeah. Oh yeah, those. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

220
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:32,020
Selling them out of the boot of my Fiat.

221
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:39,140
So yeah, again, the boosting thing is interesting. I'm not sure it's going to have much success,

222
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:43,780
but I think it just also shows like, I don't know a nice way to put this,

223
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:48,020
so I'm just going to say it bluntly. It shows how desperate Twitch is to make money right now.

224
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:54,740
Is that they're allowing the content creators to essentially buy advertisements.

225
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:56,900
Do you know what I would be interested in buying?

226
00:19:56,900 --> 00:20:00,180
Hey, Twitch, hey, let me give you some advice. You didn't ask for it.

227
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:04,660
Here's what I would be interested in buying, provided it's priced reasonably,

228
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:06,900
perhaps for my own channel, perhaps for other channels.

229
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:11,220
I would be interested in buying something that removes the ads from my channel for everybody.

230
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:15,940
There's no more ads on my channel and maybe I'll pay like whatever,

231
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:19,540
15 bucks a month, whatever, you know, you want to set.

232
00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:21,300
I'll pay it to get rid of ads completely.

233
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:27,460
But I'm tired of having to pay that much in all of the people I'm subbed to.

234
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:28,100
Oh, right.

235
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:29,620
And I'm subbed to a lot of people.

236
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:34,100
I was going to say, I see you in a lot of channels.

237
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:36,660
Well, no, I can be in a lot of chats and follow them.

238
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:38,180
I'm talking about the subs I have.

239
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:39,860
I see you subbing to a lot of channels.

240
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:44,980
And I need to apologize to those friends and take a step back.

241
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:46,100
I don't.

242
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:48,100
You know, I don't think you need to apologize to anybody.

243
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:55,540
And no one, no one should expect a sub from anyone, because that's when

244
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:57,300
you should all sub to me.

245
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:58,900
I'm kidding, kidding, kidding.

246
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:03,380
That's when Twitch turns into a pyramid scheme, basically.

247
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:07,460
And this was this was the exact same criticism I had a Patreon for.

248
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:13,220
And I in some ways I still do is that there is a social pressure

249
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:18,020
that if I donate to this Patreon, you need to donate to my Patreon.

250
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:19,140
So what are we doing?

251
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:22,340
We're giving each other money and letting Patreon take a cut of it.

252
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:24,740
That is the exact same thing that happens

253
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:29,140
when Twitch people feel a requirement to sub to each other's channels.

254
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:32,100
All you're doing is amazoning Twitch.

255
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:32,660
Yeah.

256
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:36,020
It's basically the whole thing is Amazon's scheme right there.

257
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:37,380
It's an MLM.

258
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:39,940
Is what Bond's 006 says.

259
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:48,580
Anyway, Bobby Blackwoven chat says, I thought Twitch turbo removes ads used to be prime gaming

260
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:51,860
used to be that way until it will on one channel.

261
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:55,540
The one that you're subscribed to with your free subscription.

262
00:21:55,540 --> 00:22:00,580
But other than that, yeah, you can just tell that Twitch is desperate to make money.

263
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:03,620
And I don't know.

264
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:05,780
There's a part of me that's starting to worry.

265
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:11,300
I'm going to be honest that Twitch, Amazon may think about cutting Twitch off at some

266
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:13,060
point if they're not making enough money.

267
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:13,560
I don't know.

268
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:21,700
So anyway, on that happy friendly note, let's move on to our gaming weeks and we're going

269
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:24,660
to talk about the types of video games that we have been playing this.

270
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:29,220
Oh, Bobby Blackwoven says Twitch turbo still gives you an ad free viewing across Twitch.

271
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:30,580
I didn't even know that was a thing.

272
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:31,220
I thought that.

273
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:33,300
Yeah, I thought that went away with prime gaming.

274
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:35,700
Let Loki go first, by the way.

275
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:36,200
What's that?

276
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:39,700
Let Loki go first so I can finish chewing.

277
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:44,180
Okay, let me go to Loki and talk about gaming weeks.

278
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:45,380
Loki, how was your gaming week?

279
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:51,460
Yeah, so I played Minecraft and I was doing video editing for that as well.

280
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:55,780
Still, I'm actually I was going through time lapses because I broke my time lapse up into

281
00:22:55,780 --> 00:23:00,580
about 12 parts because I had like several different sessions that I built stuff in.

282
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:04,740
So I'm actually thinking about just cutting out the time lapse because it's not that interesting

283
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:05,220
anyways.

284
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:06,740
And then that'll save me a whole bunch of time.

285
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:11,460
I put my episode out, which should have been out last week, but, you know, took longer

286
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:13,540
than anticipated, as usual.

287
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:19,540
And then, of course, I played more power washing sim.

288
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:29,940
So now I'm all the way through like I'm on the Hansel and Gretel cottage thing, which

289
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:30,980
is interesting.

290
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:34,420
And then I just finished up the skate park, which is pretty big.

291
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:40,180
I just bought the the the best power washer in the game.

292
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:44,980
And yeah, it's it's still something I keep playing.

293
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:46,340
It's a good, good.

294
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:48,100
I don't want to think about anything.

295
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:54,340
Just let my mind go to mush game where you just power wash.

296
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:59,060
And I didn't realize that like the R key actually rotates the power washer adapter, which I

297
00:23:59,060 --> 00:24:02,420
wish I had figured that out at the beginning, because I know like on the keys, they have

298
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:05,860
it mapped to like X and C is supposed to like rotate through stuff.

299
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:11,300
But I thought that actually would like rotate your sprayer, but it never seemed to do that.

300
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:13,620
But yeah, R does that apparently.

301
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:14,180
And so that.

302
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:14,820
Oh, my God.

303
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:15,300
Noted.

304
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:18,580
I was trying to use that today and I'm like, I thought Z and X was supposed to rotate the

305
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:18,980
gun.

306
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:19,220
Yeah.

307
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:20,900
So it's R R does.

308
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:22,900
Yeah, it'll rotate at 90 degrees.

309
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:30,900
So it's yeah, that helped me out a lot with, you know, being able to spray in different

310
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:31,860
directions and stuff.

311
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:33,060
So, yep.

312
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:35,700
So that's it.

313
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:37,060
That's what I played this week.

314
00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:37,540
All right.

315
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:38,740
Let's see if our soccer is ready.

316
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:40,020
Your gaming week, our soccer.

317
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:46,180
Um, I picked up a couple of games for a certain somebody in my house's upcoming birthday on

318
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:46,980
the following month.

319
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:51,540
Um, I will not say what they are in case he is listening.

320
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:56,500
Um, I bought a game and ended up getting a different game.

321
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:58,180
And then the person sent me the right game.

322
00:24:58,180 --> 00:25:02,020
So this is the game I ordered, which is peel peel for Super Famicom.

323
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:06,260
I also got sent, um, puzzle day pawn.

324
00:25:07,060 --> 00:25:11,300
So yeah, first for the podcast, folks, she's holding up the cartridges.

325
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:13,060
So she's this is a show and tell.

326
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:17,460
I mean, really, I was only out four bucks in general, but the person was really nice

327
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:19,300
about it and they get some good games in.

328
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:22,500
So, um, but it was like through Makari or something.

329
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:24,260
Um, it's a puzzle upon.

330
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:26,900
That was the one that was on the Neo Geo as well.

331
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:32,420
Um, or is that different games on his Tetris attack and Pokemon Puzzle League, right?

332
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:33,460
Yeah.

333
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:34,100
Yeah.

334
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:34,820
Okay.

335
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:34,980
Yeah.

336
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:36,580
I'm not mad.

337
00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:37,860
Puzzle day pawn is fun.

338
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:38,500
Yeah, yeah, it is.

339
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:39,380
Yeah.

340
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:42,500
Cause they have a game called puzzle day pawn on the Neo Geo.

341
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:44,260
That was like bust a move.

342
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:46,660
So, uh, I used to, I used to play it.

343
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:48,100
Tunnel day pawn.

344
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:51,940
No, they call it puzzle the pawn in, on the Neo Geo.

345
00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:55,140
I know it's should be like paneled upon, but it's puzzled upon.

346
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:58,740
I, I promise you, I played it all the time when I worked at round table.

347
00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:01,140
That's one of the four Neo Geo games that we had.

348
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:03,620
Mandela effect in action.

349
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:06,260
It is not the Mandela effect in action.

350
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:07,780
I guarantee it is.

351
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:08,100
Okay.

352
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:08,980
Puzzle day pawn.

353
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:13,460
Maybe that might've been the name for us distribution.

354
00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:15,940
No, it's right here.

355
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:18,580
SNK and Taito puzzle day pawn.

356
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:21,220
I am not insane.

357
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:21,620
All right.

358
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:22,660
Bob and Bobby.

359
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:23,540
Bobby's confirming.

360
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:24,660
He Googled it.

361
00:26:24,660 --> 00:26:25,140
You're right.

362
00:26:25,780 --> 00:26:26,180
All right.

363
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:26,580
All right.

364
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:26,980
All right.

365
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:27,300
Chat.

366
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:29,460
Chat says, Loki's right.

367
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:29,780
Fine.

368
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:30,660
Come on.

369
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:31,860
We were trying to gaslight him.

370
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:34,020
You guys let us have fun.

371
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:34,580
I'm just kidding.

372
00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:36,660
I, I really did that.

373
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:37,940
Maybe I'm the one.

374
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:39,460
Wasn't Nintendo published.

375
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:43,300
So interesting.

376
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:45,300
Puyo Puyo was Bonpresto.

377
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:46,500
Anyway.

378
00:26:47,620 --> 00:26:52,980
Um, so there's that, um, I've also been watching a lot of people play new world.

379
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:59,940
And if I figured out, I can't, it will not run on a windows arm, which is the version

380
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:01,380
I have to run in parallels.

381
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:08,260
So I can't do it unless I install one of those, uh, uh, motherboards in my old PC,

382
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:13,540
uh, whenever I can get some time to and upgrade my graphics card and get a better hard drive.

383
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:18,820
Cause it's, it's kind of just like, oh, I don't want to do anything.

384
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:21,140
And then that way I'll leave it on steam link it.

385
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:22,100
And I'm fine.

386
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:22,600
Yeah.

387
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:29,380
I have been able to steam link a lot of stuff, honestly enough through, uh, my, uh, windows

388
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:29,880
arm.

389
00:27:30,580 --> 00:27:34,340
So like whenever I want to use, uh, like source filmmaker.

390
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:41,620
I I'm playing, I'm doing it like in my Mac build, but it's streaming from my little,

391
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:43,940
you know, virtual windows.

392
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:44,980
So weird.

393
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:52,420
Um, I'm also, uh, um, I am playing a lot of dead by daylight.

394
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:59,300
Uh, I played a lot of dead by daylight, um, when I did that marathon and I'm doing another

395
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:04,740
marathon, 14 hours of dead by daylight, 13 hours, 13 hours, lucky 13, because I had to

396
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:06,500
be stubborn and make it one more hour.

397
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:08,420
And then I'm like, okay, I can't do this anymore.

398
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:17,300
What I have learned from this, no one plays dead by daylight at 4 AM or five or six, just

399
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:17,800
saying.

400
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:26,420
Um, my next one is going to be, uh, for, uh, well, I've mentioned my, my lesbian moms,

401
00:28:26,420 --> 00:28:26,920
right?

402
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:28,420
A while ago on the show.

403
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:32,340
It's been some time, but I know this just from knowing you for so long.

404
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:35,940
I'm not sure every listener's heard this of these individuals before.

405
00:28:36,820 --> 00:28:43,300
When I had just started college, um, I was taken in by some very dear friends of mine.

406
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:50,340
Um, and I always refer to them as my mama son and my papa son, um, not to be confused

407
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:56,900
with furniture, but, um, they, they really took good care of me at a time when I desperately

408
00:28:56,900 --> 00:28:57,540
needed it.

409
00:28:57,540 --> 00:29:04,340
And I was in a really, really bad spot, just, you know, mentally, I was unmedicated and

410
00:29:04,340 --> 00:29:05,940
didn't know I was autistic at the time.

411
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:08,900
Um, so they took me in, they took care of me.

412
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:11,700
They've been there for me for some pretty major stuff.

413
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:14,580
They're actually the people who introduced me to Dan.

414
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:23,940
So, um, funny enough, uh, back in the day, um, my, uh, Dan's old AOL screen name was

415
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:32,660
dark ryoga and, uh, uh, and, uh, uh, papa son had a ryoga screen name as well.

416
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:36,020
And then I, mine was dark Uchon.

417
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:39,380
So it was pretty, pretty funny.

418
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:42,660
Um, and by the way, people don't whisper me during this show, please.

419
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:51,060
Um, it was just really funny that, um, that I met Dan that way and I had actually met

420
00:29:51,060 --> 00:29:52,500
my friend Julie before that.

421
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:58,340
Um, in the sailor moon AOL chat room, but, uh, I didn't know that Julie and Dan were

422
00:29:58,340 --> 00:29:59,220
friends at the time.

423
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:05,140
So, but anyway, um, so, you know, I moved to California every time I'd go back, I'd

424
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:07,300
have to go see them and hang out with them.

425
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:15,220
And so, uh, to put things forward now, um, uh, papa son has been, uh, recently diagnosed

426
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:17,060
with cancer, like a few days ago.

427
00:30:17,780 --> 00:30:25,060
Um, had, I also heard that she had her first, uh, chemo treatment today and is feeling pretty

428
00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:25,860
beat up by it.

429
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:34,180
Um, and, uh, I want to do something to give back to them.

430
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:39,140
I don't really have like a whole lot of bonus money right now.

431
00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:42,980
Um, which is why I'm trying to, you know, dial back my Twitch stuff.

432
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:49,220
Um, but I figured I do have kind of have an audience, you know, I get people in from time

433
00:30:49,220 --> 00:30:53,620
to time and I'm pretty good at making friends and I have friends who would support me in

434
00:30:53,620 --> 00:30:53,860
this.

435
00:30:54,500 --> 00:31:02,180
So, um, I'm doing another marathon, um, not tomorrow, Monday, but next Monday on the 11th.

436
00:31:02,180 --> 00:31:03,860
Um, I'll link stuff in the chat room.

437
00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:05,700
I would greatly appreciate some support.

438
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:12,900
I'm doing it from 11 AM to 11 PM Pacific time, um, which I figured would accommodate our

439
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:17,380
West coast and East coast and maybe some of our Australian people.

440
00:31:17,380 --> 00:31:24,420
Cause that would be going into the, the late afternoon for them and maybe some of our UK

441
00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:26,900
people earlier in the day, you know, get them in the evening.

442
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:28,180
Probably going to work out at some other time.

443
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:28,420
Yeah.

444
00:31:29,060 --> 00:31:29,540
Yeah.

445
00:31:29,540 --> 00:31:32,980
Um, and it also means I still don't have to get up before 10 AM, so that's good.

446
00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:40,820
Um, but, uh, I really want to give back to Barbara.

447
00:31:40,820 --> 00:31:44,260
Barbara has been an amazing, just an amazing human being in general.

448
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:50,180
Um, a delight, delightful human, uh, has always taken good care of my mom and son.

449
00:31:50,180 --> 00:31:55,620
They take good care of each other and just one of my absolute dearest friends, my chosen

450
00:31:55,620 --> 00:31:56,020
family.

451
00:31:56,660 --> 00:32:00,420
And I mean that in the truest sense of chosen family.

452
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:05,780
So I would appreciate if everyone would help me.

453
00:32:05,780 --> 00:32:09,220
Well, let me know how I can help besides just, um, trying to get the word out.

454
00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:11,460
So, um, you know, if you want, there is a GoFundMe.

455
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:12,580
Okay.

456
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:20,020
And I'll put the links for that in there, but I will say that if you, um, for friends

457
00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:28,820
who donate before the marathon, your amount, your donations will count toward the, the

458
00:32:28,820 --> 00:32:29,380
giveaways.

459
00:32:30,340 --> 00:32:35,540
So, um, I will make sure that that information gets, uh, LinkedIn chat.

460
00:32:35,540 --> 00:32:38,660
Cause you know, y'all, y'all have all helped me.

461
00:32:38,660 --> 00:32:40,740
People in the community have been really great to me.

462
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:46,340
And, uh, I want to, I also want to provide some entertainment in the form of me complaining

463
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:47,140
about survivors.

464
00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:48,660
All right.

465
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:50,820
There is a $5,000 goal.

466
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:54,100
If I can hit $5,000, I will play survivor.

467
00:32:54,820 --> 00:32:55,300
All right.

468
00:32:55,860 --> 00:32:56,980
I'll be in a Swift with y'all.

469
00:32:56,980 --> 00:32:59,140
That's a big goal, but it's a good, it's a good cause.

470
00:32:59,140 --> 00:33:02,020
Like if you're going to raise $5,000 for anything, this is the reason.

471
00:33:02,020 --> 00:33:04,180
And I might lower that to three.

472
00:33:04,820 --> 00:33:05,220
All right.

473
00:33:05,780 --> 00:33:11,940
Well, anything else for your gaming week, dark saga?

474
00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:16,580
Um, a little bit of pinball, played some pinball world cup.

475
00:33:17,380 --> 00:33:22,900
Um, harass the cat, harass the cat is my favorite game.

476
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:23,400
Really.

477
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:26,260
Is it you harassing the cat or the cat harassing you?

478
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:28,020
I don't know what her deal is.

479
00:33:28,020 --> 00:33:29,140
Maybe she's just getting old.

480
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:34,340
Cause she's going to be 10, um, around my birthday, but she's just been like, I'm going

481
00:33:34,340 --> 00:33:39,140
to sit in your lap and then she'll do like the flat cat thing, you know, where she just

482
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:40,340
turns into a pancake.

483
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:41,620
Yes.

484
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:43,940
And then I'll just pet and purr pet and purr.

485
00:33:45,060 --> 00:33:48,900
And then she's like, she fucks off into the night as cat.

486
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:50,740
By the way, I haven't, I have any mascot.

487
00:33:51,940 --> 00:33:53,060
The ferret is no more.

488
00:33:54,260 --> 00:33:54,500
Yeah.

489
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:55,940
I have the iridescent platypus.

490
00:33:55,940 --> 00:33:56,900
The iridescent plat.

491
00:33:56,900 --> 00:33:57,300
That's good.

492
00:33:57,300 --> 00:34:00,180
Cause I'm like, I don't even know where those ferret things are anymore.

493
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:01,540
I'm many of them.

494
00:34:02,660 --> 00:34:03,140
All right.

495
00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:05,300
The original ferret is in my possession.

496
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:06,740
Oh, well that's good.

497
00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:09,540
I'm glad, glad it's, uh, got a good home.

498
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:13,700
There was a couple on the cotton, or I think there was like one at least on the Katamari

499
00:34:13,700 --> 00:34:14,660
that Namco had.

500
00:34:14,660 --> 00:34:15,160
Yes.

501
00:34:15,860 --> 00:34:18,420
One of them got placed on a Katamari ball at E3.

502
00:34:18,420 --> 00:34:21,620
I do remember that it was, it was sacrificed to the Katamari gods.

503
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:24,340
Uh, orange right in chat.

504
00:34:24,340 --> 00:34:26,260
The last ferret is in captivity.

505
00:34:26,260 --> 00:34:27,780
The galaxy is at peace.

506
00:34:30,660 --> 00:34:31,780
Gold star comment of the week.

507
00:34:31,780 --> 00:34:32,180
All right.

508
00:34:32,980 --> 00:34:33,380
Let's see.

509
00:34:33,380 --> 00:34:36,580
Uh, I want to address this too, before we get to my gaming week, uh, along the lines

510
00:34:36,580 --> 00:34:38,500
of, of dead by daylight.

511
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:43,860
She-Hulk Tandon chat says I have been playing tons of Friday, the 13th, the game, awesome

512
00:34:43,860 --> 00:34:46,340
horror, fun, highly underrated.

513
00:34:46,340 --> 00:34:49,380
You know, that game kind of came and went and what's interesting.

514
00:34:49,380 --> 00:34:54,100
That game came out right around the time dead by daylight did, uh, in fact, I believe Friday

515
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:56,900
the 13th came out a few months before it was first.

516
00:34:56,900 --> 00:34:58,420
I think it was first.

517
00:34:58,420 --> 00:35:03,140
Um, and, uh, it's, but it's the same idea four versus one and it's survivors and killer,

518
00:35:03,140 --> 00:35:05,300
but the killer in this case is Jason.

519
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:08,660
But, and they gave away that game on PlayStation plus for a hot minute too.

520
00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:09,300
Anyway.

521
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:11,460
Um, yeah, it's, it's a really fun game.

522
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:17,300
The only problem is that the game got kind of fucked over by all the legal problems that

523
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:20,180
have been going on around the Friday the 13th franchise.

524
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:24,180
And I believe in related note, that was all figured out this week.

525
00:35:24,180 --> 00:35:29,380
I was seeing something about like that the guy who wrote Friday the 13th ended up, he

526
00:35:29,380 --> 00:35:33,380
does have the rights because he wrote the movie as a contractor or something like that.

527
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:33,860
I don't know.

528
00:35:33,860 --> 00:35:39,300
So, so, but legally there's probably a lot of ground still to cover, but, um, yeah, I

529
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:40,980
mean the Friday the 13th game was great.

530
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:45,940
Um, but it just, it couldn't go really much further than where it went because of all

531
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:46,740
the legal problems.

532
00:35:46,740 --> 00:35:49,460
Like it really got screwed by these outside legal problems.

533
00:35:49,460 --> 00:35:51,700
So that's really unfortunate.

534
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:51,940
Yeah.

535
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:53,380
It was as of yesterday.

536
00:35:53,380 --> 00:35:55,620
So she'll 10 says, Oh, nine versus one.

537
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:56,980
I always thought it was four V one.

538
00:35:56,980 --> 00:35:58,980
I didn't realize they expanded it later on.

539
00:35:58,980 --> 00:36:00,100
That's kind of cool.

540
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:06,500
Um, so yeah, so now people are wondering, Oh, does this lawsuit mean that now dead by

541
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:10,020
daylight could get Jason and I settled down.

542
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:11,700
It could have happened anyway.

543
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:12,020
Yeah.

544
00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:14,500
Just, and just in general, settle down.

545
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:18,100
Like there's, there's, we already have Myers and Freddie.

546
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:20,980
There still is the Friday the 13th game.

547
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:25,700
Uh, you know, I, I would say they tried to get that going again before suddenly adding

548
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:28,020
Jason to dead by daylight, but I don't know.

549
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:31,780
Nothing's impossible in this day and age, but I, I just wouldn't, I wouldn't, uh.

550
00:36:31,780 --> 00:36:34,500
Well, and now we have, um, the Cenobite.

551
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:37,380
We have the hell king, the hell priest.

552
00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:41,940
I mean, it really is as, as you've described it before, it really is the Avengers of horror

553
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:42,580
in that game.

554
00:36:43,140 --> 00:36:44,820
We need candy man next.

555
00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:45,940
We do need candy, ma'am.

556
00:36:45,940 --> 00:36:46,420
That'd be awesome.

557
00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:46,980
Pumpkin head.

558
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:48,580
All right.

559
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:54,260
Anyway, that's another, uh, big one.

560
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:57,300
Well, we need the real ghost face.

561
00:36:57,300 --> 00:37:01,060
And a lot of dead by daylight players make this mistake is that they assume the ghost

562
00:37:01,060 --> 00:37:02,500
faced as a scream license.

563
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:06,420
And they're always like, well, why don't we have, you know, Neve Campbell or, or whatever

564
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:07,540
as a survivor?

565
00:37:07,540 --> 00:37:12,500
Well, have you ever noticed when you read the bio ghost face is not the ghost face.

566
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:14,420
It's just a completely made up character.

567
00:37:14,420 --> 00:37:18,420
They, because they licensed trailer was hilarious.

568
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:21,060
But again, had nothing to do with scream.

569
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:23,060
They licensed the mask.

570
00:37:23,060 --> 00:37:24,420
That's what they licensed.

571
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:26,020
They didn't license anything with scream.

572
00:37:26,020 --> 00:37:31,700
Scream had to license the mask when it ended up becoming such a huge thing in that game.

573
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:33,300
She hold 10 says jaws.

574
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:42,740
So by the way, I have to ask real quick and this'll be the last thing for dead by daylight

575
00:37:42,740 --> 00:37:43,380
for right now.

576
00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:43,700
All right.

577
00:37:44,260 --> 00:37:45,540
What do you think of barista witch?

578
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:50,420
Oh, Oh, um, I, I hope this, I can't do the PTB.

579
00:37:50,420 --> 00:37:54,180
I hope this doesn't offend, but I think I've actually heard this come out of your mouth.

580
00:37:54,180 --> 00:37:55,620
Um, she, she looks like you.

581
00:37:56,500 --> 00:38:04,180
Yeah, I am the barista, which looks like you like maybe like in a hot topic phase.

582
00:38:04,180 --> 00:38:12,980
If I was really skinny, you know, but she's got red curly hair, wears glasses, um, is

583
00:38:12,980 --> 00:38:14,980
into new agey stuff.

584
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:16,660
Hello.

585
00:38:16,660 --> 00:38:17,300
Is a witch.

586
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:19,940
Like storytelling.

587
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:20,180
Yeah.

588
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:23,940
Loves books and likes spooky shit.

589
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:25,860
Oh yeah, no, she's you.

590
00:38:25,860 --> 00:38:26,420
She really is.

591
00:38:26,420 --> 00:38:30,340
She's also the first survivor to be taken in front of a crowd of people.

592
00:38:33,220 --> 00:38:37,620
So me entity is getting pretty ballsy.

593
00:38:37,620 --> 00:38:42,420
By the way, I finally faced a survivor named Vinnie entity.

594
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:43,780
I can die happy.

595
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:44,280
All right.

596
00:38:44,660 --> 00:38:48,580
Uh, by just the chat is, uh, giving suggestions.

597
00:38:48,580 --> 00:38:50,020
Uh, and I like the SSJ 100.

598
00:38:50,020 --> 00:38:51,380
Matt says the Babadook.

599
00:38:51,380 --> 00:38:52,980
That's a good suggestion.

600
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:55,780
Uh, they should add, uh, the Babadook for gay pride month.

601
00:38:55,780 --> 00:38:58,260
Um, Bon Stobel six says a creature from the film.

602
00:38:58,260 --> 00:39:00,580
The mist dark Tetsuya says Chucky.

603
00:39:00,580 --> 00:39:02,500
That's a great, that's a great idea.

604
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:06,740
Uh, our voiceover friend, Jason, what's your face?

605
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:10,580
Uh, VX chase XV says, how about the Hocus Pocus witches?

606
00:39:10,580 --> 00:39:12,420
They're not, that's, that's more Disney horror.

607
00:39:12,420 --> 00:39:13,220
They're not scary.

608
00:39:13,860 --> 00:39:14,100
Yeah.

609
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:16,100
You can't mix Disney horror with dead by daylight.

610
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:17,620
Unfortunately, believe it or not.

611
00:39:17,620 --> 00:39:20,740
I got into a sort of debate with polyester on Twitter.

612
00:39:20,740 --> 00:39:21,240
Yeah.

613
00:39:21,620 --> 00:39:26,180
Who's like one, one of the big streamer folks, um, has that in with behavior.

614
00:39:26,820 --> 00:39:33,460
Um, and he's talking about having Elvira as a survivor and I was like, or a killer.

615
00:39:33,460 --> 00:39:38,020
And I was like, nah, survivor would kick the observer out of his little damn tower and

616
00:39:38,020 --> 00:39:40,180
give us narc the entire time.

617
00:39:40,180 --> 00:39:40,500
Yeah.

618
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:46,340
I would see Elvira more as somebody that, uh, it, you would see in the, um, the, why

619
00:39:46,340 --> 00:39:51,540
don't I keep, when you say the, uh, the book, the, the, that mode, the shrine of

620
00:39:51,540 --> 00:39:55,140
secrets, that whole thing or that whole thing for the, for the record, Michigan's

621
00:39:55,140 --> 00:39:58,660
Lizzie Borden actually did not kill anybody.

622
00:39:59,460 --> 00:40:05,620
She was, uh, actually never, um, uh, what was the word I'm thinking of?

623
00:40:05,620 --> 00:40:07,700
She, she was a judge, not guilty.

624
00:40:08,260 --> 00:40:17,060
So I don't like that, that a girl's reputation has been sullied by people

625
00:40:17,060 --> 00:40:18,500
wanting to blame her for a murder.

626
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:19,380
She didn't do so.

627
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:21,140
All right.

628
00:40:21,140 --> 00:40:22,260
We, we said no more dead by daylight.

629
00:40:22,260 --> 00:40:23,780
Phantasm would be great.

630
00:40:23,780 --> 00:40:25,060
End of dead by j lights hat.

631
00:40:25,060 --> 00:40:26,420
Oh, one more, one more.

632
00:40:26,420 --> 00:40:32,820
No, the, the, the, uh, pastor from, uh, poltergeist too.

633
00:40:32,820 --> 00:40:33,780
All right.

634
00:40:33,780 --> 00:40:35,540
And he sings the whole time like the huntress.

635
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:37,380
Enough, but it definitely should.

636
00:40:37,380 --> 00:40:38,660
Original trailer Sonic.

637
00:40:39,540 --> 00:40:40,040
Yeah.

638
00:40:40,580 --> 00:40:41,300
All right.

639
00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:42,740
Moving on my gaming week.

640
00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:44,100
I want to talk about my gaming week.

641
00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:45,540
So what did I play during my gaming week?

642
00:40:45,540 --> 00:40:46,580
I played dead by daylight.

643
00:40:46,580 --> 00:40:46,980
Okay.

644
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:50,340
Uh, besides that, I played more cookie clicker.

645
00:40:50,340 --> 00:40:53,780
I'm up to 400 achievements unlocked in cookie clicker.

646
00:40:53,780 --> 00:40:58,340
I've clicked a lot of cookies, uh, 560 something.

647
00:40:58,340 --> 00:41:00,260
I think is maybe five 40.

648
00:41:00,260 --> 00:41:02,820
Somebody in chat might be able to correct me on that.

649
00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:05,060
But, um, yeah, dead by daylight.

650
00:41:05,140 --> 00:41:05,700
I'm sorry.

651
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:07,780
I I'm looking at my phone, my notes, but cookie clicker.

652
00:41:07,780 --> 00:41:07,940
Yeah.

653
00:41:07,940 --> 00:41:11,220
I've unlocked 400 of the achievements, uh, in that so far.

654
00:41:11,780 --> 00:41:13,940
Uh, then I played more Final Fantasy 14.

655
00:41:13,940 --> 00:41:17,460
I actually did a little stream on Friday just to, uh, make sure I'm trying to stream on

656
00:41:17,460 --> 00:41:18,900
a somewhat regular basis.

657
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:24,260
And, uh, I'm still working to get all my classes to 80 before end walkers out.

658
00:41:24,260 --> 00:41:28,260
And the clock is ticking because there's less than 50 days to go before end Walker.

659
00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:30,580
So, um, I gotta, I gotta get going on that.

660
00:41:30,580 --> 00:41:36,980
My monk is 65, my warrior 66 and my black mage is 75.

661
00:41:36,980 --> 00:41:38,020
So I'm really close.

662
00:41:38,020 --> 00:41:42,020
Um, I just gotta, you know, put the pedal to the metal and make sure I'm doing my roulettes

663
00:41:42,020 --> 00:41:45,460
every day, um, to get up to 80 on all the classes.

664
00:41:46,180 --> 00:41:52,180
I've also been continuing to play Final Fantasy 13 on Xbox backwards compatibility.

665
00:41:52,180 --> 00:41:54,180
I just got to chapter seven today.

666
00:41:54,180 --> 00:41:56,340
So I've been, you know, making my way a little bit through that.

667
00:41:56,420 --> 00:42:01,300
And, uh, the, I, I posted some things on Twitter and stuff with some of the like cutscenes

668
00:42:01,300 --> 00:42:05,300
and things, and you can see they look a lot better now than they did on the PlayStation

669
00:42:05,300 --> 00:42:10,180
three, or especially the original Xbox 360 release, uh, really looked, uh, not great,

670
00:42:10,180 --> 00:42:12,260
uh, by today's standards anyway.

671
00:42:12,260 --> 00:42:18,500
Um, so it's nice how they've really, you know, um, uh, made it run on the nicer resolutions.

672
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:23,940
Uh, it's, it's almost, it's almost like it's a remaster except it's not really, uh, a remaster.

673
00:42:23,940 --> 00:42:26,180
So, um, but it's, uh, it's great.

674
00:42:26,980 --> 00:42:32,260
And then I played one other game this week and it's something that, uh, Loki's talked

675
00:42:32,260 --> 00:42:34,820
a lot about on this show and he did tonight.

676
00:42:34,820 --> 00:42:37,860
And I finally was like, all right, I got to pick up this game and see what this is all

677
00:42:37,860 --> 00:42:38,500
about.

678
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:41,460
Uh, and so I picked up power wash simulator.

679
00:42:41,460 --> 00:42:44,020
Um, have you ever seen that Reddit?

680
00:42:44,020 --> 00:42:48,100
I think it's called like mildly satisfying or oddly satisfying.

681
00:42:48,100 --> 00:42:53,540
And it's just a collection of pictures that are like, huh, that is, that is mildly satisfying.

682
00:42:53,620 --> 00:42:58,740
Like, it's just like a, like a perfectly organized bookshelf or something where all the colors

683
00:42:58,740 --> 00:43:00,260
have been sorted appropriately.

684
00:43:00,260 --> 00:43:03,700
And you're like, well, that is, that is a mildly satisfying photo, right?

685
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:06,020
This is that as a game.

686
00:43:07,380 --> 00:43:10,020
That is what our watch simulator is.

687
00:43:10,020 --> 00:43:11,220
You want to know what's funny?

688
00:43:11,220 --> 00:43:11,460
What?

689
00:43:12,100 --> 00:43:14,580
When my meds aren't working, I clean.

690
00:43:15,380 --> 00:43:16,820
Well, then this, this...

691
00:43:16,820 --> 00:43:18,420
And I clean meticulously.

692
00:43:18,420 --> 00:43:19,940
This is a game that's an outlet.

693
00:43:19,940 --> 00:43:24,020
Well, this is wild because I don't clean this well in real life, but being able to have

694
00:43:24,020 --> 00:43:26,180
this in a game sure is a lot of fun.

695
00:43:26,180 --> 00:43:26,740
And okay.

696
00:43:26,740 --> 00:43:28,580
So power wash simulator.

697
00:43:28,580 --> 00:43:30,180
It is exactly yes.

698
00:43:30,180 --> 00:43:33,940
DJ rama S and chat says perfectly organized ethernet cabling.

699
00:43:33,940 --> 00:43:34,180
Yes.

700
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:36,980
That is so fucking satisfying to look at.

701
00:43:36,980 --> 00:43:37,220
Right.

702
00:43:37,860 --> 00:43:39,860
And that's what power wash simulator is.

703
00:43:39,860 --> 00:43:45,300
And if it's exactly what you think you get dropped in a level where something is really

704
00:43:45,300 --> 00:43:46,420
fucking dirty.

705
00:43:46,420 --> 00:43:52,260
Like one of the early levels is a backyard and it's like everything is just overtaken

706
00:43:52,260 --> 00:43:54,420
with, you know, growth and whatever.

707
00:43:54,420 --> 00:43:58,340
And so you and your little power wash gun just start to go to work and you just do a

708
00:43:58,340 --> 00:43:59,300
little piece at a time.

709
00:44:00,260 --> 00:44:07,300
You just spray it, power washing the patio rocks, power washing the little pond, power

710
00:44:07,300 --> 00:44:12,900
washing the fence, each post and the very satisfying as you complete each little part

711
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:15,700
and you power wash it to God's satisfaction.

712
00:44:15,700 --> 00:44:21,860
You get the little little day and it lights up and then it becomes super sparkling and

713
00:44:21,860 --> 00:44:23,380
it's really satisfying.

714
00:44:23,380 --> 00:44:25,220
And then you get to bigger and better levels.

715
00:44:25,220 --> 00:44:30,340
So Loki, I just did the playground level was the one I just finished where you have the

716
00:44:30,340 --> 00:44:35,220
Stegosaurus slide that's like purple and you go in there and everything is just like black

717
00:44:35,220 --> 00:44:36,020
mold everywhere.

718
00:44:36,020 --> 00:44:36,420
Right.

719
00:44:36,420 --> 00:44:40,180
But then once you clean everything up, it's like, oh, there's like all these shiny colors

720
00:44:40,260 --> 00:44:41,060
and things.

721
00:44:41,060 --> 00:44:43,940
And then here is the best part.

722
00:44:43,940 --> 00:44:48,740
Here is the part when you're like, ah, now that is satisfying.

723
00:44:49,380 --> 00:44:57,140
Once you beat a level, you are presented with a short movie in fast time of you cleaning

724
00:44:57,140 --> 00:44:57,620
the level.

725
00:44:58,580 --> 00:45:02,660
So you get to see how you removed all the dirt and where.

726
00:45:02,660 --> 00:45:06,180
And it just and then you see very own time lapse.

727
00:45:06,180 --> 00:45:08,180
Yeah, it's very it's its own little time lapse thing.

728
00:45:08,740 --> 00:45:10,500
You know, because it might have taken you like I'm not kidding.

729
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:13,140
It probably took me like two hours to clean that playground.

730
00:45:13,140 --> 00:45:13,700
Right.

731
00:45:13,700 --> 00:45:17,380
But then once it's done, it's like, ah, you see that time lapse video and you're like.

732
00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:19,620
That's satisfying.

733
00:45:21,380 --> 00:45:24,900
And it also makes me go, I want a power wash gun in real life.

734
00:45:24,900 --> 00:45:28,660
And then I go, oh, wait, I know I live in I live in California.

735
00:45:28,660 --> 00:45:30,900
That's probably not something I'm allowed to have.

736
00:45:31,940 --> 00:45:32,740
Sure it is.

737
00:45:32,740 --> 00:45:33,300
No, you can't.

738
00:45:33,300 --> 00:45:33,700
You can.

739
00:45:33,700 --> 00:45:34,580
I know you can.

740
00:45:34,580 --> 00:45:39,380
But it's it's frowned on to use those probably as much as I do in that game.

741
00:45:39,380 --> 00:45:44,180
Although I do understand that game has modes where you can limit your water consumption

742
00:45:44,180 --> 00:45:46,580
and you can like change the difficulty in ways like that.

743
00:45:46,580 --> 00:45:50,100
I don't know why I would ever do that to myself, because then that is no longer.

744
00:45:52,020 --> 00:45:56,500
I think they're challenge modes where you have like you race against time or you have

745
00:45:56,500 --> 00:46:01,620
like a limited amount of water and then you're supposed to just like see how much you can

746
00:46:01,620 --> 00:46:03,300
clean within that certain time period.

747
00:46:04,900 --> 00:46:09,860
So it's and you might think like, but no, there is because you can actually change the

748
00:46:09,860 --> 00:46:11,860
nozzle on your power washer.

749
00:46:11,860 --> 00:46:15,780
And so you have to decide, do you want to do something that's very strong, but a very,

750
00:46:15,780 --> 00:46:17,780
very, very small kind of stream coming out?

751
00:46:17,780 --> 00:46:19,780
So you're like only washing a little bit.

752
00:46:19,780 --> 00:46:22,820
Or do you want to increase how much of an area your power covering?

753
00:46:22,820 --> 00:46:23,860
But it's not strong.

754
00:46:23,860 --> 00:46:27,620
So you might have to go over an area like four times in order to really clean it.

755
00:46:27,620 --> 00:46:34,580
So SSJ 100 Matt says, wouldn't mind seeing a power wash simulator run in GDQ silly block.

756
00:46:34,580 --> 00:46:35,300
Oh, for sure.

757
00:46:35,300 --> 00:46:38,740
The game is in early access still, though.

758
00:46:38,740 --> 00:46:39,300
But it does.

759
00:46:39,300 --> 00:46:40,580
I don't notice it.

760
00:46:40,580 --> 00:46:42,580
Like I notice games that are in early access.

761
00:46:42,580 --> 00:46:43,700
I don't notice this.

762
00:46:43,700 --> 00:46:47,300
Maybe the fact that there's only really a handful of guns and upgrades.

763
00:46:47,300 --> 00:46:51,060
But like, I don't want that to come across like a negative because I don't think the

764
00:46:51,060 --> 00:46:51,780
game really needs it.

765
00:46:51,780 --> 00:46:53,220
They're adding new levels all the time.

766
00:46:53,220 --> 00:46:56,180
They just added like a carnival level, which I haven't gotten to yet.

767
00:46:56,660 --> 00:46:58,260
I saw the thing on the.

768
00:46:58,260 --> 00:47:02,180
I did one where you were on fucking Mars cleaning the Mars rover.

769
00:47:02,180 --> 00:47:09,140
And I was like, and again, in the mildly satisfying department, your character can jump, right?

770
00:47:09,140 --> 00:47:10,340
So that's how you get to some.

771
00:47:10,340 --> 00:47:13,380
I mean, there are ladders you can move around and things like that to get to high places.

772
00:47:13,380 --> 00:47:14,580
But you can also jump.

773
00:47:14,580 --> 00:47:20,980
But Loki on the Mars level, when you jump, you float, you jump like low gravity like

774
00:47:20,980 --> 00:47:22,420
you would on Mars.

775
00:47:22,420 --> 00:47:25,460
That was very fucking satisfying when that happened.

776
00:47:25,460 --> 00:47:26,980
I was like, oh, I'm on Mars.

777
00:47:26,980 --> 00:47:28,340
My jump is a little different.

778
00:47:30,900 --> 00:47:31,380
That's cool.

779
00:47:31,380 --> 00:47:32,580
I have to try that one.

780
00:47:32,580 --> 00:47:35,060
Yeah, that one was it's not in the career mode.

781
00:47:35,060 --> 00:47:36,340
It's like in a bonus level.

782
00:47:38,340 --> 00:47:43,460
So it's only difficult because there's so many little fucking parts on that thing.

783
00:47:43,460 --> 00:47:46,740
It's constantly going like you're cleaning all these parts.

784
00:47:46,740 --> 00:47:49,940
And then, of course, you're left with like three parts and you're like, I don't know

785
00:47:49,940 --> 00:47:53,140
where these fucking things are on the other.

786
00:47:53,140 --> 00:47:56,420
Nice thing is, too, if you have a hard time seeing the dirt, I think this is very important

787
00:47:56,420 --> 00:47:57,540
for people to know.

788
00:47:57,540 --> 00:48:03,780
If you press the tab key, all the dirt turns fluorescent orange and it becomes much easier

789
00:48:03,780 --> 00:48:04,420
to see.

790
00:48:04,420 --> 00:48:08,660
And so when you also don't have to clean every single thing, it like it'll give it to you

791
00:48:08,660 --> 00:48:09,940
like at 95%.

792
00:48:09,940 --> 00:48:12,020
Yeah, it'll give it to you at a pretty high percentage.

793
00:48:12,020 --> 00:48:12,900
So, yeah.

794
00:48:13,860 --> 00:48:19,780
So anyway, that that is that is my shout out and satisfaction for what is probably I swear

795
00:48:19,780 --> 00:48:22,020
to God will probably be one of my favorite games of the year.

796
00:48:22,020 --> 00:48:24,100
Power wash simulator like no joke.

797
00:48:24,100 --> 00:48:27,620
It's just it is a satisfying fucking gaming experience.

798
00:48:27,620 --> 00:48:30,020
And that's I think all I ask from gaming.

799
00:48:30,020 --> 00:48:34,420
Maybe I'm a little biased because the power wash simulator team actually retweeted a tweet

800
00:48:34,420 --> 00:48:35,220
of mine.

801
00:48:35,220 --> 00:48:37,700
So I got a little semi viral tweet.

802
00:48:37,700 --> 00:48:38,500
I wrote a tweet.

803
00:48:39,620 --> 00:48:44,180
That said, hell, yeah, I play first person shooters and it was a picture of power wash

804
00:48:44,180 --> 00:48:47,940
simulator with me hosing down the deck and they retweeted it.

805
00:48:49,780 --> 00:48:51,460
And so apparently it's caught on.

806
00:48:51,460 --> 00:48:55,060
So I guess that's I'm a first person shooter main now.

807
00:48:55,060 --> 00:48:55,700
There is that.

808
00:48:56,260 --> 00:48:57,060
All right.

809
00:48:57,060 --> 00:49:02,500
So, yeah, these and folks in chat, like, for example, She-Hulk 10 says they have a lawnmower

810
00:49:02,500 --> 00:49:03,780
simulator as well.

811
00:49:03,780 --> 00:49:04,340
Yeah.

812
00:49:04,340 --> 00:49:09,220
And I don't think they're necessarily all done by the same company, but it's just the

813
00:49:09,220 --> 00:49:13,300
simulator games are just suddenly all the rage for whatever reason.

814
00:49:13,300 --> 00:49:18,580
So it's they're good for content because you can do silly things in a lot of them.

815
00:49:18,580 --> 00:49:21,300
And so this one, though, not so much.

816
00:49:21,300 --> 00:49:23,860
This one got a lot of attention because Markiplier is playing it.

817
00:49:23,860 --> 00:49:29,300
He's like a 10, 10, 12 like video series for it.

818
00:49:29,300 --> 00:49:31,060
I mean, he's just really addicted to it.

819
00:49:31,060 --> 00:49:32,980
So that got some popularity.

820
00:49:32,980 --> 00:49:35,220
But yeah, it's just a fun game.

821
00:49:36,340 --> 00:49:39,620
I'll be Bobby Blackwell pointed out my tweet has 69 likes.

822
00:49:40,340 --> 00:49:40,580
Nice.

823
00:49:41,300 --> 00:49:42,420
Nobody liked my tweet.

824
00:49:44,100 --> 00:49:44,600
All right.

825
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:50,520
Um, so, uh, yeah, yeah, I love in the power wash.

826
00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:51,960
Sam, it's it's a lot of fun.

827
00:49:52,760 --> 00:49:57,080
Tiger Claw in chat says it's funny how a lot of simulators are based on very mundane tasks,

828
00:49:57,080 --> 00:49:57,580
isn't it?

829
00:49:58,040 --> 00:50:01,480
But it's I don't it's I can't explain it.

830
00:50:01,480 --> 00:50:05,560
It's just so satisfying to see the sparkle when you're all done with a level.

831
00:50:05,560 --> 00:50:07,880
So I will be playing a lot more of this game.

832
00:50:07,880 --> 00:50:10,920
And yeah, like I said, probably going to end up on ironically being one of my favorite

833
00:50:10,920 --> 00:50:11,480
games of the year.

834
00:50:11,480 --> 00:50:15,240
All right, let's move on.

835
00:50:15,240 --> 00:50:16,840
We have some other gaming news to get into.

836
00:50:17,480 --> 00:50:18,280
Let's do it.

837
00:50:18,840 --> 00:50:22,280
Because I don't really Oh, I guess Okay, I have one housekeeping little thing I should

838
00:50:22,280 --> 00:50:25,320
probably bring up at some point because I'm not even sure my co hosts know.

839
00:50:25,320 --> 00:50:26,200
So surprise.

840
00:50:27,160 --> 00:50:30,360
I will not be here the last Sunday of the month.

841
00:50:31,240 --> 00:50:34,200
No, then because last Sunday of the month is Halloween.

842
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:34,680
Oh, shit.

843
00:50:34,680 --> 00:50:35,960
Are we gonna do a show on Halloween?

844
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:37,720
Probably not.

845
00:50:37,720 --> 00:50:38,680
I didn't think about that.

846
00:50:38,680 --> 00:50:42,440
We might have to because I will not be here on the 24th for sure.

847
00:50:42,440 --> 00:50:45,480
So we might have to tape something in advance for one of those weeks.

848
00:50:45,480 --> 00:50:48,200
Um, so yeah, I will not be here on the 24th.

849
00:50:48,200 --> 00:50:49,400
I'm going to Disneyland.

850
00:50:50,680 --> 00:50:52,040
And you're not taking me?

851
00:50:52,040 --> 00:50:52,540
No.

852
00:50:55,480 --> 00:50:56,600
It's expensive.

853
00:50:58,600 --> 00:51:02,040
But I'm taking Alan and I'll bring you back something if you're nice.

854
00:51:02,680 --> 00:51:03,080
Okay.

855
00:51:03,080 --> 00:51:03,580
Okay.

856
00:51:04,120 --> 00:51:05,880
They don't have Duffy stuff anymore.

857
00:51:06,600 --> 00:51:13,080
Yeah, we're just we were going and I wanted I was like, okay, we plan that weekend to go

858
00:51:13,080 --> 00:51:17,240
and I was like, Alright, well, if I'm going to go down there, then I want to see like,

859
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:19,480
it's going to be right before Victoria's birthday.

860
00:51:19,480 --> 00:51:20,280
I want to see Victoria.

861
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:22,360
So I said, Victoria, what are you doing this weekend?

862
00:51:22,360 --> 00:51:24,680
So of course, you know what the reply was?

863
00:51:24,680 --> 00:51:26,200
Well, we're going to Disneyland on this day.

864
00:51:26,200 --> 00:51:27,960
So I was like, Alright, fuck it.

865
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:29,880
We're going to so we're doing that.

866
00:51:29,880 --> 00:51:34,840
And we're hoping to meet some like Twitch friends and some other IRL friends while we're

867
00:51:34,840 --> 00:51:35,320
down there.

868
00:51:35,320 --> 00:51:37,720
So it's a friend-a-thon while we're down there.

869
00:51:37,720 --> 00:51:42,600
You bet you better, better, better say hi to two of my favorite LA people.

870
00:51:43,560 --> 00:51:45,320
I have a feeling I know who you're talking about.

871
00:51:45,320 --> 00:51:46,600
Let's talk offline.

872
00:51:46,600 --> 00:51:49,080
But Alan is coordinating all that.

873
00:51:49,080 --> 00:51:51,480
So Alan probably took care of that.

874
00:51:51,480 --> 00:51:51,980
So yeah.

875
00:51:52,520 --> 00:51:53,020
Alright.

876
00:51:53,640 --> 00:51:54,680
Anyway, let's move on.

877
00:51:54,680 --> 00:51:56,440
We have some more gaming news to get into.

878
00:51:56,440 --> 00:51:56,940
Loki.

879
00:51:57,880 --> 00:52:03,960
So with the success of Super Mario Brothers and the Super Nintendo World,

880
00:52:05,960 --> 00:52:13,480
Universal and Nintendo are excited to announce the Seth Rogen themed world coming to Super

881
00:52:13,480 --> 00:52:14,440
Nintendo World.

882
00:52:14,440 --> 00:52:16,440
That is, of course, Donkey Kong.

883
00:52:18,200 --> 00:52:22,360
I would hope they would call it Donkey Kong Country, but it's just it's a section of the

884
00:52:22,360 --> 00:52:23,960
world going to be for Donkey Kong.

885
00:52:25,880 --> 00:52:29,720
But yeah, that is going to be something that they're working on at Universal Japan.

886
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:34,280
Nowhere necessarily when that's going to come out, but oh, yeah.

887
00:52:34,280 --> 00:52:39,000
Opening 2024, it's going to increase the size of Super Nintendo World by 70 percent.

888
00:52:40,520 --> 00:52:43,800
Hopefully it has some better rides in the Super Nintendo World.

889
00:52:43,800 --> 00:52:49,960
As much as I love Mario and stuff and the Mario Kart ride looks all right, I guess not

890
00:52:49,960 --> 00:52:54,200
as cool as the VR Mario Kart that I saw at some of the Namco places.

891
00:52:55,720 --> 00:52:57,880
They could use some more grown up rides.

892
00:52:58,440 --> 00:53:00,600
I'm hoping that they do something like that.

893
00:53:01,320 --> 00:53:07,640
So Tiger Claw in chat says the fact Donkey Kong is being added to Universal Japan might

894
00:53:07,640 --> 00:53:11,880
be the reason why they are bringing Donkey Kong into the Super Mario animated movie.

895
00:53:13,080 --> 00:53:16,840
I actually totally agree with Tiger Claw here.

896
00:53:18,280 --> 00:53:25,800
I think there I can't say that all the time, but I actually think this gives a lot of kind

897
00:53:25,800 --> 00:53:32,600
of fire behind the idea that a big name like Seth Rogen was cast as Donkey Kong because

898
00:53:32,600 --> 00:53:34,600
that is absolutely a spinoff.

899
00:53:34,600 --> 00:53:39,320
They're planning for the future is a more Donkey Kong centered movie in the future.

900
00:53:39,880 --> 00:53:43,560
Bobby Black Wolf in chat says Donkey Kong was literally the first Mario game.

901
00:53:43,560 --> 00:53:47,560
Sure, but now it's the cinematic universe and I don't think the rules have to follow

902
00:53:47,560 --> 00:53:48,680
a similar pattern.

903
00:53:48,680 --> 00:53:54,200
I don't think we have to expect a Donkey Kong movie, but I think there's a lot of interesting

904
00:53:54,280 --> 00:54:02,920
alignments happening that is between the casting of an A-lister like Seth Rogen and this new

905
00:54:02,920 --> 00:54:06,200
news about the park expanding to include Donkey Kong.

906
00:54:06,200 --> 00:54:12,840
Because surely you Nintendo fans and such as I are wondering why isn't it Zelda?

907
00:54:14,200 --> 00:54:19,160
If you're going to expand a Nintendo theme park, would you not add Zelda?

908
00:54:19,160 --> 00:54:20,440
That would make sense, right?

909
00:54:20,440 --> 00:54:22,440
That would be the biggest Mario thing.

910
00:54:22,440 --> 00:54:26,680
Or okay, maybe actually technically Zelda is no longer the new land.

911
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:32,200
If they really wanted to do the biggest Nintendo franchise at this point, they would add an

912
00:54:32,200 --> 00:54:35,160
Animal Crossing world would be the world that they would add to it.

913
00:54:35,720 --> 00:54:37,320
But they didn't do either of those things.

914
00:54:38,120 --> 00:54:40,600
And this is a movie based theme park.

915
00:54:41,320 --> 00:54:47,160
So I really think that there is a I really think there's a something something here where

916
00:54:47,160 --> 00:54:50,520
Donkey Kong is being set up to be a spin-off movie.

917
00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:51,080
And why not?

918
00:54:51,080 --> 00:54:54,360
I mean, this really could be a whole Nintendo cinematic universe.

919
00:54:54,360 --> 00:54:56,520
If the movie does well, why wouldn't they?

920
00:54:56,520 --> 00:54:59,000
Why wouldn't they do a Mario sequel?

921
00:54:59,000 --> 00:54:59,880
Of course.

922
00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:02,440
Why wouldn't Wario get brought into the picture?

923
00:55:02,440 --> 00:55:03,880
I mean, cross your fingers and toes.

924
00:55:03,880 --> 00:55:05,480
He's Charles Martinet, I suppose.

925
00:55:05,480 --> 00:55:09,160
Those of you that are upset about him not getting past cast as Mario.

926
00:55:09,160 --> 00:55:10,520
Why wouldn't they set that up?

927
00:55:10,520 --> 00:55:11,960
That sort of cinematic thing.

928
00:55:11,960 --> 00:55:13,080
And then Donkey Kong.

929
00:55:13,080 --> 00:55:15,720
And then who knows where it goes from there?

930
00:55:15,960 --> 00:55:20,200
So anyway, TigerClaus says, imagine King K.

931
00:55:20,200 --> 00:55:22,760
Rool shows up in a post-credits scene.

932
00:55:22,760 --> 00:55:25,320
Well, that that'll all but guarantee it, right?

933
00:55:25,320 --> 00:55:28,600
Pod culture says, and everything ends in Smash Brothers.

934
00:55:29,320 --> 00:55:36,040
You joke, but that's that's the they'll have someone come up and talk to you about the

935
00:55:36,040 --> 00:55:37,640
Smash initiative.

936
00:55:39,080 --> 00:55:43,640
I mean, would anyone be upset with that twist?

937
00:55:44,520 --> 00:55:45,240
Nope.

938
00:55:45,240 --> 00:55:45,740
Nope.

939
00:55:47,720 --> 00:55:49,240
So we'll see what happens.

940
00:55:49,240 --> 00:55:53,080
I think that might be a hard thing to pull off because I think the Pokemon movie rights

941
00:55:53,880 --> 00:55:55,240
are now sitting somewhere else.

942
00:55:55,240 --> 00:55:57,800
But it would be interesting to see if they're able to make that work out.

943
00:55:57,800 --> 00:55:58,760
That's for sure.

944
00:55:58,760 --> 00:56:01,080
They they've done ambitious before.

945
00:56:01,080 --> 00:56:03,320
I mean, look at Avengers Endgame.

946
00:56:03,960 --> 00:56:04,440
Sure.

947
00:56:04,440 --> 00:56:09,320
And they ended up bringing things like Fantastic Four and Spider-Man, you know, they've gotten

948
00:56:09,320 --> 00:56:10,600
all those rights worked out.

949
00:56:10,600 --> 00:56:12,360
So anything's possible.

950
00:56:12,360 --> 00:56:12,760
Sure is.

951
00:56:12,760 --> 00:56:14,200
Because Disney owns everything.

952
00:56:14,200 --> 00:56:15,000
Hi, husband.

953
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:15,500
Thank you.

954
00:56:16,760 --> 00:56:17,240
Thank you.

955
00:56:17,240 --> 00:56:19,640
He set down the coffee I mentioned before.

956
00:56:19,640 --> 00:56:20,200
What is this?

957
00:56:20,200 --> 00:56:26,120
They instead of putting numbers on the drinks now, they draw they draw spooky images.

958
00:56:26,120 --> 00:56:27,880
They drew a spider web on mine.

959
00:56:27,880 --> 00:56:28,840
What is that all about?

960
00:56:30,680 --> 00:56:31,080
All right.

961
00:56:31,080 --> 00:56:32,520
Anyway, thank you.

962
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:35,560
Okay, let's move on to our oh, shit.

963
00:56:35,560 --> 00:56:36,360
I'm our next story.

964
00:56:36,360 --> 00:56:38,920
I guess I can't enjoy coffee until I read our next story.

965
00:56:39,640 --> 00:56:41,080
Yeah, Rob, let's get to it.

966
00:56:41,240 --> 00:56:46,280
Um, this story has to do with Nintendo buying another studio.

967
00:56:46,280 --> 00:56:49,560
Oh, boy, they've taken one out of Microsoft's playbook lately, haven't they?

968
00:56:50,840 --> 00:56:53,800
I'm sorry, did I say I'm sorry, Sony, my bad.

969
00:56:53,800 --> 00:56:59,320
Sony bought another studio and they're taking a playbook out of Microsoft here because I

970
00:56:59,320 --> 00:57:01,720
feel like Sony has bought a lot of studios.

971
00:57:02,520 --> 00:57:05,240
I feel like we've talked about that a lot in the past couple months.

972
00:57:06,120 --> 00:57:09,080
But these are all studios and this is no exception.

973
00:57:09,800 --> 00:57:14,360
Where it's like, oh, I kind of thought they were involved with Sony already anyway, or

974
00:57:14,360 --> 00:57:16,280
like Sony had an ownership in their way.

975
00:57:16,280 --> 00:57:17,960
It's more like making it official.

976
00:57:17,960 --> 00:57:21,000
So anyway, it's Blue Point Games is who they acquired this week.

977
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,080
Blue Point Games is based out of Austin.

978
00:57:23,880 --> 00:57:28,280
Recently, they remade they did the remake of Demon's Souls, which obviously was a pretty

979
00:57:28,280 --> 00:57:29,720
big PlayStation five.

980
00:57:29,720 --> 00:57:33,800
That was really one of the only PlayStation five launch titles exclusive anyway.

981
00:57:33,800 --> 00:57:37,400
And they also did that Shadow of the Colossus remake as well.

982
00:57:37,400 --> 00:57:44,360
So there's been rumors that Sony was going to buy Blue Point right around the time that

983
00:57:44,360 --> 00:57:45,720
Sony bought Housemarque.

984
00:57:45,720 --> 00:57:48,760
A lot of people were saying they're going to buy Blue Point as well.

985
00:57:48,760 --> 00:57:51,240
And it turns out, yes, that is what's happening.

986
00:57:51,240 --> 00:57:55,720
What is not known as of yet is Blue Point going to be remastering past titles again,

987
00:57:55,720 --> 00:57:57,640
because that seems to be something they do well.

988
00:57:57,640 --> 00:57:59,480
Or are they going to work on a new IP?

989
00:58:00,040 --> 00:58:03,720
We don't know what they're working on yet, but I'm sure we'll find out in the not too

990
00:58:03,720 --> 00:58:04,840
distant future.

991
00:58:04,840 --> 00:58:07,800
So anybody have any strong feelings with that?

992
00:58:09,800 --> 00:58:11,240
No, it's one of those.

993
00:58:11,240 --> 00:58:15,400
I already thought they kind of were owned by Sony, but, you know, I guess it's making

994
00:58:15,400 --> 00:58:20,680
it official a little bit or take their it's what they're taking their relationship to

995
00:58:20,680 --> 00:58:21,960
the next level.

996
00:58:21,960 --> 00:58:22,840
That's what it is.

997
00:58:23,560 --> 00:58:26,440
We knew they were dating and sleeping together.

998
00:58:26,440 --> 00:58:30,440
We just now they're taking it to the next level where, you know, Sony is continuing

999
00:58:30,440 --> 00:58:35,560
their what do you call the polyamory sect.

1000
00:58:35,560 --> 00:58:40,760
They're continuing to expand that in their sister wives with yet another studio.

1001
00:58:40,760 --> 00:58:41,080
All right.

1002
00:58:41,080 --> 00:58:42,040
Forget these analogies.

1003
00:58:42,040 --> 00:58:44,200
Let's go to the next story.

1004
00:58:45,400 --> 00:58:47,400
I actually have an emergency announcement.

1005
00:58:47,400 --> 00:58:47,720
Okay.

1006
00:58:48,360 --> 00:58:51,560
You know, one of my favorite channels is the Boundary Break.

1007
00:58:52,360 --> 00:58:52,920
I did not.

1008
00:58:52,920 --> 00:58:54,200
There's a Dead by Daylight one now.

1009
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,080
Oh, that's right.

1010
00:58:57,160 --> 00:59:02,680
That's the one where they go outside the different they use like the free cam stuff to explore

1011
00:59:02,680 --> 00:59:04,600
different areas and go outside the boundary.

1012
00:59:04,600 --> 00:59:08,440
And now you don't even have to be headed on and dead dog for it to happen.

1013
00:59:10,280 --> 00:59:17,800
Anyway, there is this has been rumors off and on mostly wishful thinking.

1014
00:59:17,800 --> 00:59:25,160
So we thought except now we're getting more reputable reporting about it.

1015
00:59:25,720 --> 00:59:31,640
So Konami is going to be following through with their post restructure plan to bring

1016
00:59:31,640 --> 00:59:38,200
back some classic game franchises, some of their biggest ones, including Metal Gear,

1017
00:59:38,200 --> 00:59:40,200
Castlevania and Silent Hill.

1018
00:59:42,680 --> 00:59:47,240
They're trying to at least this is what the talk is.

1019
00:59:48,040 --> 00:59:53,480
Sources are saying that the new Castlevania game is going to be a reimagining of this

1020
00:59:53,560 --> 00:59:57,000
series and that it's currently internally in development.

1021
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:57,800
Konami Japan.

1022
00:59:59,400 --> 01:00:02,440
They also are getting some support from external studios.

1023
01:00:02,440 --> 01:00:04,920
I have lots of support from external studios.

1024
01:00:09,160 --> 01:00:11,640
There also looks like they're working with Virtuos.

1025
01:00:12,600 --> 01:00:18,520
So we'll see that's actually trying to do the various

1026
01:00:19,160 --> 01:00:24,600
rereleases for Dark Souls and all of that.

1027
01:00:24,600 --> 01:00:30,360
But there was some talk about Blue Point working on a Metal Gear Solid remake.

1028
01:00:31,080 --> 01:00:32,840
So we'll see.

1029
01:00:32,840 --> 01:00:36,120
I mean, things haven't looked all that positive right now.

1030
01:00:37,320 --> 01:00:41,800
And then there also talks about multiple Silent Hill games that are under development.

1031
01:00:42,440 --> 01:00:44,600
So we'll see.

1032
01:00:44,600 --> 01:00:49,960
I have a couple of questions with this number.

1033
01:00:49,960 --> 01:00:51,320
A couple of shrugs.

1034
01:00:51,320 --> 01:00:54,760
Number one, where the fuck is Suikoden?

1035
01:00:54,760 --> 01:00:59,560
We always we always have these discussions about classic Konami franchises coming back

1036
01:00:59,560 --> 01:01:03,160
and all the love is Castlevania, Metal Gear, Silent Hill.

1037
01:01:03,160 --> 01:01:04,120
Sure, sure, sure.

1038
01:01:04,120 --> 01:01:05,800
Those are all good franchises.

1039
01:01:05,800 --> 01:01:12,040
But can we not have Suikoden uttered in that same sentence of great Konami franchises?

1040
01:01:12,040 --> 01:01:13,800
Obviously, I'm not picking on you, Dark Soccer.

1041
01:01:13,800 --> 01:01:17,720
I'm picking on everything like I'm picking on Konami, of course.

1042
01:01:18,280 --> 01:01:20,520
Why isn't Suikoden part of this conversation?

1043
01:01:20,520 --> 01:01:24,440
But I guess at least we have that whole Ioden Chronicles thing.

1044
01:01:24,440 --> 01:01:26,600
And I think we're all just prayer circling.

1045
01:01:26,600 --> 01:01:33,240
It doesn't turn out like the Mega Man Kickstarter thing that flopped.

1046
01:01:33,800 --> 01:01:34,600
Oh, Mighty No. 9?

1047
01:01:34,600 --> 01:01:35,640
Yes, that one.

1048
01:01:35,640 --> 01:01:37,080
I think we're just all prayer circling.

1049
01:01:37,080 --> 01:01:41,720
It doesn't go that way, which it doesn't look that way.

1050
01:01:41,960 --> 01:01:45,960
You know, so, yeah, that's that's my first question.

1051
01:01:45,960 --> 01:01:46,680
Where is Suikoden?

1052
01:01:46,680 --> 01:01:49,800
My second question is this rumor we're hearing.

1053
01:01:49,800 --> 01:01:51,720
I mean, I feel like we're hearing this rumor every year.

1054
01:01:52,760 --> 01:01:56,120
And again, I don't I don't fault Dark Soccer for bringing it up now, because the reason

1055
01:01:56,120 --> 01:02:02,680
is and why why it's relevant again is that it's more and more respectable or reputable

1056
01:02:02,680 --> 01:02:04,440
blogs that are picking it up.

1057
01:02:04,440 --> 01:02:11,000
This is no longer like so-and-so said on Twitter or my uncle posted on Resetera or whatever

1058
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:12,520
that forum is called now.

1059
01:02:12,520 --> 01:02:14,440
Like it's it's not those types of things.

1060
01:02:14,440 --> 01:02:18,520
This is like sources that have confirmed things for us before confirming that this is what's

1061
01:02:18,520 --> 01:02:19,020
happening.

1062
01:02:20,520 --> 01:02:23,240
So I guess we'll see at next E3.

1063
01:02:24,520 --> 01:02:27,480
So let me ask this question, because we're all longtime Konami fans.

1064
01:02:27,480 --> 01:02:29,720
Oh, by the way, I left out an important seat.

1065
01:02:29,720 --> 01:02:30,040
Damn it.

1066
01:02:30,040 --> 01:02:32,440
I knew I was going to forget something in my gaming week.

1067
01:02:32,440 --> 01:02:34,680
So I'll bring it up here because it's Konami.

1068
01:02:34,680 --> 01:02:36,680
A very important game I played in my gaming week.

1069
01:02:37,480 --> 01:02:41,960
I went to Conquered this week because I went to a concert in the middle of the week.

1070
01:02:41,960 --> 01:02:43,640
I went to see Alanis Morissette in Garbage.

1071
01:02:43,640 --> 01:02:47,480
I was living my best 90s life out in Conquered this week.

1072
01:02:47,480 --> 01:02:50,760
But since we were killing a little time before the concert, we went to round one.

1073
01:02:51,320 --> 01:02:57,240
So I played Beatmania 2DX Beastover, I think is what it's called.

1074
01:02:57,240 --> 01:02:59,560
The newest Beastrover.

1075
01:02:59,560 --> 01:03:00,060
That one.

1076
01:03:00,600 --> 01:03:01,480
I played that.

1077
01:03:02,280 --> 01:03:05,480
It's 2DX 28th style is what it is now, believe it or not.

1078
01:03:06,360 --> 01:03:06,860
Jeez.

1079
01:03:07,320 --> 01:03:07,820
I know.

1080
01:03:09,480 --> 01:03:11,960
Remember when I thought the pinnacle was like 7th style.

1081
01:03:11,960 --> 01:03:12,280
I know.

1082
01:03:12,280 --> 01:03:15,320
Remember when we were driving to Arcade Infinity to play 10th style?

1083
01:03:15,320 --> 01:03:17,560
Like now it's on 23.

1084
01:03:17,560 --> 01:03:19,000
This isn't all that great.

1085
01:03:21,800 --> 01:03:26,040
I will say so they've redone the machine and I don't know if it was redone

1086
01:03:26,600 --> 01:03:29,240
for this one or the last one.

1087
01:03:29,240 --> 01:03:31,560
The magic something was the last.

1088
01:03:31,560 --> 01:03:34,440
I don't remember, but they've redone the machine.

1089
01:03:34,440 --> 01:03:36,600
So I got to play on the new machine.

1090
01:03:36,600 --> 01:03:38,680
It's great because it's a better monitor.

1091
01:03:38,680 --> 01:03:40,520
Now it's a more like high definition monitor.

1092
01:03:40,520 --> 01:03:45,480
The cabinet actually has like sides that are built onto it to help contain the sound.

1093
01:03:45,480 --> 01:03:47,160
And OK, it was OK.

1094
01:03:47,160 --> 01:03:48,040
Heroic verse.

1095
01:03:48,040 --> 01:03:48,600
Thank you, Orange.

1096
01:03:48,600 --> 01:03:48,840
Right.

1097
01:03:48,840 --> 01:03:52,840
See, I knew some of you that are better at following the recent news would pick that

1098
01:03:52,840 --> 01:03:53,400
up there.

1099
01:03:53,400 --> 01:03:56,120
So yeah, it was heroic verse.

1100
01:03:56,120 --> 01:03:57,400
OK, yes.

1101
01:03:57,400 --> 01:03:59,480
So they changed the cabinet with that.

1102
01:04:00,280 --> 01:04:01,720
And here's the best part.

1103
01:04:01,720 --> 01:04:04,440
There is now a monitor below the monitor.

1104
01:04:04,440 --> 01:04:05,960
That's like a touch pad.

1105
01:04:05,960 --> 01:04:09,480
That's where they moved all the sliders to for the sound.

1106
01:04:09,480 --> 01:04:15,160
So you know me, I take all the sliders and I max volume and then you type you or you

1107
01:04:15,160 --> 01:04:16,200
press equalizer.

1108
01:04:16,200 --> 01:04:19,720
You don't have to hit the effector button to get what you want anymore is my point.

1109
01:04:19,720 --> 01:04:21,480
Everything's controlled on that bottom pound.

1110
01:04:21,480 --> 01:04:25,080
You put in your passcodes for EMUs down there and all that other stuff, too.

1111
01:04:25,080 --> 01:04:27,720
So I thought the new cabinet was almost better than anything else.

1112
01:04:28,840 --> 01:04:31,080
But I also played some of the new songs.

1113
01:04:31,080 --> 01:04:35,480
I kind of like because, you know, if I play a 2DX cabinet, I just want to go and play

1114
01:04:35,480 --> 01:04:36,520
old songs all day.

1115
01:04:36,520 --> 01:04:38,920
But I really forced myself to play the new stuff.

1116
01:04:38,920 --> 01:04:40,920
And actually, I enjoyed the stuff I played.

1117
01:04:40,920 --> 01:04:43,720
There's like 2DX red theme is in there.

1118
01:04:43,720 --> 01:04:45,560
I think it's a remix, but it was really good.

1119
01:04:45,560 --> 01:04:48,360
So so yeah, anyway, sorry.

1120
01:04:48,360 --> 01:04:52,200
I know I'm meddling the story a little bit, but that was an important thing for me to

1121
01:04:52,200 --> 01:04:53,880
throw out is that I did get to play that this week.

1122
01:04:55,240 --> 01:04:59,240
And Bobby Black Wolf is asking, did you relax and enjoy the concert?

1123
01:04:59,240 --> 01:05:00,200
Yes, I did.

1124
01:05:00,200 --> 01:05:01,800
And I had a very good time.

1125
01:05:01,800 --> 01:05:05,560
And it's been five days now and I don't feel sick.

1126
01:05:05,560 --> 01:05:06,760
So I think that's a good sign.

1127
01:05:07,480 --> 01:05:09,320
It was all is not outdoor venue anyway.

1128
01:05:09,320 --> 01:05:15,080
But the interesting thing, just a quick tangent about where we were at.

1129
01:05:15,080 --> 01:05:17,000
So Concord is in Contra Costa County.

1130
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:19,080
I did not realize they mandated this.

1131
01:05:19,720 --> 01:05:23,080
We had to have our vaccine cards checked to go into round one.

1132
01:05:23,800 --> 01:05:27,480
And again, when we went to go eat at the restaurant next door, they checked our vaccine card.

1133
01:05:27,480 --> 01:05:28,680
I'm so glad to hear that.

1134
01:05:28,680 --> 01:05:31,640
Which which I'm I'm I'm fine with that.

1135
01:05:31,640 --> 01:05:34,760
I was just more it was it was the pleasant surprise.

1136
01:05:34,760 --> 01:05:39,400
Like, oh, oh, well, yes, I will show you my vaccine card to get in here.

1137
01:05:40,040 --> 01:05:45,960
But the concert venue didn't require it because they're outdoor.

1138
01:05:45,960 --> 01:05:46,920
The others are indoor.

1139
01:05:46,920 --> 01:05:51,960
However, my understanding is as of October 4th, the concert tomorrow, the concert venue

1140
01:05:51,960 --> 01:05:53,720
will also be asking for those sorts of things.

1141
01:05:53,720 --> 01:05:54,840
So I thought that was interesting.

1142
01:05:54,840 --> 01:05:55,640
Very, very interesting.

1143
01:05:56,200 --> 01:05:59,000
Um, anyway, um, where was I?

1144
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:02,200
Oh, yes, the title revivals for Konami and all this stuff.

1145
01:06:02,200 --> 01:06:07,160
So, um, yeah, I mean, like, obviously, Bahmani and Jason kind of referenced it tongue in

1146
01:06:07,160 --> 01:06:07,880
cheek in the intro.

1147
01:06:07,880 --> 01:06:09,960
Bahmani is still doing fine for Konami.

1148
01:06:09,960 --> 01:06:11,000
Nothing's wrong there.

1149
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:14,440
It's all these other home console titles where it's like, damn, we wish they would really

1150
01:06:14,440 --> 01:06:17,160
put themselves on the right track and all that stuff.

1151
01:06:17,160 --> 01:06:24,680
Um, but yeah, I don't know if I trust Konami themselves to do it.

1152
01:06:24,680 --> 01:06:28,200
And I think Loki, when you said that very tongue in cheek about, I hope they're getting

1153
01:06:28,200 --> 01:06:29,960
help from outside sources.

1154
01:06:29,960 --> 01:06:31,000
Big, same.

1155
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:35,720
I mean, the Castlevania Advance Collection is pretty good, but Konami sent that out to

1156
01:06:35,720 --> 01:06:37,320
another developer to put that all together.

1157
01:06:37,320 --> 01:06:39,800
And they were games that already existed anyway.

1158
01:06:39,800 --> 01:06:42,440
So, uh, because the things Konami develops in house.

1159
01:06:43,960 --> 01:06:46,040
Well, Loki, why don't we go to our next story?

1160
01:06:46,040 --> 01:06:47,160
Yeah, let's talk about that.

1161
01:06:47,160 --> 01:06:51,560
Let's talk about the wonderful things that they talk about our concerns in house.

1162
01:06:51,560 --> 01:06:52,840
Please bring in exhibit A.

1163
01:06:53,800 --> 01:07:00,600
As, as I had mentioned during our release, um, a release date segment last week that

1164
01:07:01,160 --> 01:07:03,640
Konami's E football game is coming out.

1165
01:07:03,640 --> 01:07:04,040
That's right.

1166
01:07:04,040 --> 01:07:07,080
That's the game that replaces pro evolution soccer.

1167
01:07:07,080 --> 01:07:12,840
And, uh, it adds a bunch of microtransactions cause it's free to play and you can pre-order

1168
01:07:12,840 --> 01:07:14,280
microtransactions.

1169
01:07:14,280 --> 01:07:16,200
And apparently the game is hot garbage.

1170
01:07:17,080 --> 01:07:18,120
Oh my God.

1171
01:07:18,120 --> 01:07:18,840
Oh my God.

1172
01:07:18,840 --> 01:07:20,600
I am so shocked.

1173
01:07:20,600 --> 01:07:21,720
Are we shocked?

1174
01:07:21,720 --> 01:07:22,200
Clap.

1175
01:07:22,200 --> 01:07:23,000
If you're shocked.

1176
01:07:23,560 --> 01:07:26,840
It like the, the character models look like garbage.

1177
01:07:26,840 --> 01:07:29,320
Um, it doesn't play well.

1178
01:07:29,320 --> 01:07:33,800
And it's funny because like, they're talking about like some of the things that they needed

1179
01:07:33,800 --> 01:07:34,520
to be fixed.

1180
01:07:35,080 --> 01:07:41,000
And you know, a lot of it is like, uh, too ridiculous.

1181
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:43,000
It's like the entire game, basically.

1182
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:49,880
Um, so I'm not really sure what the issue was with this, why it got released in this

1183
01:07:49,960 --> 01:07:50,520
state.

1184
01:07:50,520 --> 01:07:59,400
But I, I mean, it just looks, I know, I know it's because Konami executives are incompetent

1185
01:07:59,400 --> 01:08:05,160
boo-boo idiots that are more concerned with getting something out on a certain date to

1186
01:08:05,160 --> 01:08:08,520
sell a bunch of pre-orders than what the quality of the game is.

1187
01:08:09,160 --> 01:08:10,200
Do I win a prize?

1188
01:08:13,080 --> 01:08:15,080
Probably, uh, no prize.

1189
01:08:15,080 --> 01:08:17,640
So you win a copy of this game, boo.

1190
01:08:18,520 --> 01:08:18,920
Yeah.

1191
01:08:18,920 --> 01:08:25,080
As, um, expected, they, uh, came out and they said, they've acknowledged that there's been

1192
01:08:25,080 --> 01:08:30,680
some reports of problems that users have with experiences or experience with cut scenes,

1193
01:08:30,680 --> 01:08:34,120
facial expressions, movements of players and the behavior of the ball.

1194
01:08:34,120 --> 01:08:35,560
That's the entire game right there.

1195
01:08:35,560 --> 01:08:38,680
I mean, like, I don't really know what more you would have in there.

1196
01:08:38,680 --> 01:08:45,400
Um, they've acknowledged that there are issues they put out there like little, we apologize

1197
01:08:46,360 --> 01:08:47,160
for problems.

1198
01:08:47,160 --> 01:08:48,280
We apologize.

1199
01:08:48,280 --> 01:08:52,760
We apologize for problems with the soccer ball in our soccer game.

1200
01:08:52,760 --> 01:08:53,240
Yeah.

1201
01:08:53,240 --> 01:08:57,720
It says we've received lots of feedback requests regarding the game balance that includes past

1202
01:08:57,720 --> 01:08:58,760
the defense operation.

1203
01:08:58,760 --> 01:09:01,800
We also like to acknowledge there've been many reports of the other issues.

1204
01:09:01,800 --> 01:09:04,760
We just said, uh, we are also very sorry for the problems.

1205
01:09:04,760 --> 01:09:05,640
We want to share everyone.

1206
01:09:05,640 --> 01:09:09,800
It will take all this concern seriously and strive to improve the current situation.

1207
01:09:10,840 --> 01:09:12,760
We will be continuously updated.

1208
01:09:12,760 --> 01:09:15,400
Quality will be improved, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

1209
01:09:18,760 --> 01:09:19,320
Dumb.

1210
01:09:19,320 --> 01:09:20,120
It's really dumb.

1211
01:09:21,080 --> 01:09:24,120
I don't know why they thought it was okay to put this out like this.

1212
01:09:24,920 --> 01:09:26,280
It's a free to play game too.

1213
01:09:26,280 --> 01:09:29,000
Like, like people, like you want them to play this.

1214
01:09:29,880 --> 01:09:31,320
This is their initial impression of it.

1215
01:09:31,320 --> 01:09:33,640
They're not going to come back to this crap.

1216
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:35,560
I don't know.

1217
01:09:36,680 --> 01:09:38,360
So it's gotten, it's down.

1218
01:09:38,360 --> 01:09:42,200
I think it like to, uh, massively negative scores on steam.

1219
01:09:43,320 --> 01:09:44,360
Unsurprisingly.

1220
01:09:44,360 --> 01:09:50,040
Um, I would like to put out a special message to anyone listening to this show who might

1221
01:09:50,040 --> 01:09:56,040
be affiliated with the Italian Siri B the Russian premier league, the French league

1222
01:09:56,040 --> 01:10:01,720
one, the AFC champions league, the Dutch era Divisi and the tie league.

1223
01:10:01,720 --> 01:10:04,840
If you represent any of those soccer leagues and you're listening, excuse me, football

1224
01:10:04,840 --> 01:10:07,720
leagues, and you're listening to this show, please pull your license.

1225
01:10:08,840 --> 01:10:10,440
Please pull your license.

1226
01:10:11,400 --> 01:10:13,400
Do what stranger doing you a disservice.

1227
01:10:13,400 --> 01:10:17,240
Do what stranger things did to dead by daylight and pull your license.

1228
01:10:18,440 --> 01:10:21,560
You know, the only reason they did that for dead by daylight was because of Netflix.

1229
01:10:21,560 --> 01:10:25,960
Do what Catan did to Niantic and pull your license.

1230
01:10:25,960 --> 01:10:31,640
So I just want to point out, like they're talking about putting out new games of these

1231
01:10:31,640 --> 01:10:32,280
franchises.

1232
01:10:32,280 --> 01:10:34,200
Let's talk about the track record of Konami.

1233
01:10:34,200 --> 01:10:38,200
So Metal Gear Solid, we had Metal Gear Solid.

1234
01:10:38,200 --> 01:10:41,720
Was it, I don't even remember it's called cause it's been blocked from my memory.

1235
01:10:41,720 --> 01:10:46,680
Crappy zombie game, Metal Gear Solid, the alternate Metal Gear Solid five universe thing

1236
01:10:46,680 --> 01:10:49,080
that they did hot garbage.

1237
01:10:49,080 --> 01:10:53,960
Um, so there's that the, the reboot Konami or the Contra game that they made that was

1238
01:10:53,960 --> 01:10:56,680
also hot garbage, the 3d one that they did.

1239
01:10:56,680 --> 01:10:58,920
Um, the only thing that's been good.

1240
01:10:59,640 --> 01:11:00,120
Hardcore.

1241
01:11:01,480 --> 01:11:02,840
No, it wasn't Contra hardcore.

1242
01:11:02,840 --> 01:11:06,760
It was, um, that was the Genesis game from back in the day.

1243
01:11:06,760 --> 01:11:07,720
Yeah, that was the Genesis.

1244
01:11:07,720 --> 01:11:07,960
Sorry.

1245
01:11:09,240 --> 01:11:10,120
Rogue Corps.

1246
01:11:10,120 --> 01:11:10,760
Thank you.

1247
01:11:10,760 --> 01:11:11,400
It was close.

1248
01:11:11,400 --> 01:11:11,880
It was close.

1249
01:11:12,520 --> 01:11:16,440
It, it's just, I don't trust them to make a good game anymore.

1250
01:11:16,440 --> 01:11:19,000
Unfortunately, like I, I just don't.

1251
01:11:19,800 --> 01:11:22,840
So I'm not excited.

1252
01:11:22,840 --> 01:11:30,920
Like if they're going to announce it, they couldn't even get the remasters of silent

1253
01:11:30,920 --> 01:11:32,040
Hill to be correct.

1254
01:11:32,040 --> 01:11:35,720
So like what makes me think they're going to be able to tackle a brand new silent Hill

1255
01:11:35,720 --> 01:11:36,360
game?

1256
01:11:36,360 --> 01:11:37,880
It's going to be garbage.

1257
01:11:37,880 --> 01:11:41,880
Although I would argue, and I've said, we've been doing this show a long time.

1258
01:11:42,760 --> 01:11:44,600
And I said this many, many years ago.

1259
01:11:44,600 --> 01:11:46,360
We've all said this many years ago.

1260
01:11:46,360 --> 01:11:48,680
I mean, Konami is doing all right with the Maimani stuff.

1261
01:11:49,320 --> 01:11:50,680
There's other companies that would do better.

1262
01:11:52,680 --> 01:11:53,180
Yeah.

1263
01:11:55,240 --> 01:11:58,360
And I, you, you know, things have come full circle.

1264
01:11:58,920 --> 01:12:02,760
You know, things have come full circle when I'm, I'm sitting here saying, you know, one

1265
01:12:02,760 --> 01:12:08,120
of the people I would really like to see have the Baimani license, the folks behind Step

1266
01:12:08,120 --> 01:12:08,760
Maniacs.

1267
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:12,840
And that's all I'm going to say about that.

1268
01:12:12,840 --> 01:12:15,640
Their games practically have the Baimani license at this point.

1269
01:12:15,640 --> 01:12:19,320
They have all of the, uh, license tracks in there.

1270
01:12:19,880 --> 01:12:23,240
Cause they, they played the long game and they've been playing it very well.

1271
01:12:25,160 --> 01:12:25,880
Anyway.

1272
01:12:25,880 --> 01:12:27,960
All right, let's move on.

1273
01:12:28,040 --> 01:12:34,360
And, uh, talk about our next story, which, uh, has to do with Nintendo rumors that never

1274
01:12:34,360 --> 01:12:34,920
stop.

1275
01:12:34,920 --> 01:12:36,360
Never, never, never stop.

1276
01:12:36,360 --> 01:12:44,600
Um, let's talk about, uh, a 4k switch because a report came out this week from Bloomberg

1277
01:12:44,600 --> 01:12:50,760
who publishes a lot of rumors about Nintendo and, uh, Bloomberg is technically an investor

1278
01:12:50,760 --> 01:12:51,640
type of magazine.

1279
01:12:51,640 --> 01:12:56,680
So they have a reason to be getting into these types of things because they, they post about

1280
01:12:56,680 --> 01:12:59,160
these rumors and stuff for the sake of investors.

1281
01:12:59,160 --> 01:13:02,840
So that's why they get into this whole thing, uh, whether they're right or they're wrong.

1282
01:13:02,840 --> 01:13:09,880
Bloomberg posted a report that said Nintendo gave at least 11 developers a toolkit to create

1283
01:13:09,880 --> 01:13:11,560
4k games for the switch.

1284
01:13:12,920 --> 01:13:17,480
This doesn't usually happen because usually Nintendo says we do not comment on speculation

1285
01:13:17,480 --> 01:13:18,040
or rumors.

1286
01:13:18,600 --> 01:13:23,160
However, I don't know if it's because Bloomberg is a thing geared toward investors.

1287
01:13:23,160 --> 01:13:26,040
I don't know if Nintendo is sick of this shit.com.

1288
01:13:26,040 --> 01:13:30,600
I don't know if Nintendo is just a Nintendo chose violence this day.

1289
01:13:30,600 --> 01:13:36,360
I don't know what it is, but Nintendo decided to put out a statement saying, no, this report

1290
01:13:36,360 --> 01:13:37,320
is not true.

1291
01:13:38,040 --> 01:13:43,640
And that is from the official Nintendo Twitter, a news report on September 30th on Twitter

1292
01:13:43,640 --> 01:13:48,120
falsely claims that Nintendo is supplying tools to drive game development for a Nintendo

1293
01:13:48,120 --> 01:13:53,400
switch with 4k support to ensure correct understanding among our investors and customers.

1294
01:13:54,360 --> 01:13:59,480
Notice the way that's ordered by the way, investors and customers.

1295
01:14:02,120 --> 01:14:03,160
This is very important.

1296
01:14:03,160 --> 01:14:06,600
Y'all understand the key difference here and why Nintendo said something this time.

1297
01:14:07,320 --> 01:14:09,080
It's because they're worried about investors.

1298
01:14:10,600 --> 01:14:14,280
We want to say there's stock prices go down if they're expecting something to come out

1299
01:14:14,280 --> 01:14:15,240
and it's not going to come out.

1300
01:14:17,160 --> 01:14:20,360
We want to clarify that this report is not true.

1301
01:14:20,360 --> 01:14:26,520
We also want to restate that as we announced in July, we have no plans for any new model

1302
01:14:26,520 --> 01:14:33,480
other than Nintendo Switch OLED model, which will launch on October 8th, 2021, which is

1303
01:14:33,480 --> 01:14:34,280
very soon, by the way.

1304
01:14:35,640 --> 01:14:39,560
Again, the Bloomberg report said Nintendo handed out 4k toolkits.

1305
01:14:39,560 --> 01:14:42,520
They asked developers to create games with 4k resolutions.

1306
01:14:43,080 --> 01:14:48,120
They named one of the publishers Zynga was one of the ones that supposedly had that 4k

1307
01:14:48,120 --> 01:14:48,440
kit.

1308
01:14:48,440 --> 01:14:51,080
I guess that's come a long way.

1309
01:14:51,080 --> 01:14:53,800
No, Zynga is doing a Star Wars game, aren't they?

1310
01:14:56,440 --> 01:14:57,000
I think they are.

1311
01:14:57,640 --> 01:14:59,560
I don't really pay attention to what they do anymore.

1312
01:14:59,560 --> 01:15:04,840
So anyway, yeah, and I think everybody's kind of waiting for the 4k to switch, but it is

1313
01:15:04,840 --> 01:15:07,960
just interesting that Nintendo decided to shoot that one down.

1314
01:15:07,960 --> 01:15:13,080
Now, all of that being said, even reading Nintendo's tweet and taking all of that into

1315
01:15:13,080 --> 01:15:13,560
account.

1316
01:15:15,560 --> 01:15:18,680
I actually I believe Bloomberg in this one.

1317
01:15:19,480 --> 01:15:21,640
I should probably because it's on Nintendo Switch.

1318
01:15:21,640 --> 01:15:22,280
I sure do.

1319
01:15:23,240 --> 01:15:30,440
Ah, see, oh, oh, ooh, Loki playing word police here.

1320
01:15:30,440 --> 01:15:31,640
But you're on the right track.

1321
01:15:32,280 --> 01:15:35,240
I absolutely Nintendo's been exploring 4k.

1322
01:15:35,240 --> 01:15:41,320
And I said this when they again, I don't like to turn the show into a game of I said this,

1323
01:15:41,320 --> 01:15:45,400
but dammit, I'm going to take my credit where I can.

1324
01:15:45,400 --> 01:15:49,080
When they announced the OLED switch, what did I say?

1325
01:15:49,080 --> 01:15:54,680
I said they're probably not releasing the 4k switch because of all these stock problems

1326
01:15:54,680 --> 01:15:58,920
with computer chips that the PlayStation 5 and the Xbox Series X are having.

1327
01:15:58,920 --> 01:15:59,720
They can't do it.

1328
01:16:00,600 --> 01:16:04,040
And what are they saying is the reason why they didn't end up doing the 4k switch.

1329
01:16:05,480 --> 01:16:07,000
That, exactly that.

1330
01:16:09,400 --> 01:16:10,600
Because of reasons.

1331
01:16:10,600 --> 01:16:13,160
Yes, it's that specific reason, basically.

1332
01:16:15,400 --> 01:16:18,040
So again, I think a 4k switch.

1333
01:16:18,040 --> 01:16:18,760
Absolutely.

1334
01:16:19,640 --> 01:16:23,960
A Nintendo device that runs 4k is absolutely out on the table.

1335
01:16:23,960 --> 01:16:27,800
But I think now, Loki, I'm going to give you credit for this one because I think you're

1336
01:16:27,800 --> 01:16:28,440
right.

1337
01:16:28,440 --> 01:16:32,360
The way they're playing this game is, well, it's not a switch.

1338
01:16:33,080 --> 01:16:35,400
It's our next console that's going to have a new name.

1339
01:16:35,400 --> 01:16:37,880
Or they can just lie about it and just say whatever, you know?

1340
01:16:37,880 --> 01:16:40,680
What are they going to do?

1341
01:16:40,680 --> 01:16:45,240
I mean, if they're not ready or anywhere near releasing it or announcing it.

1342
01:16:45,240 --> 01:16:46,040
Super Switch.

1343
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:50,040
Switch U.

1344
01:16:50,040 --> 01:16:50,440
Interesting.

1345
01:16:50,440 --> 01:16:52,120
I saw that on a Grindr profile once.

1346
01:16:52,120 --> 01:16:52,760
All right.

1347
01:16:52,760 --> 01:16:54,920
Anyway, let's move on.

1348
01:16:55,960 --> 01:16:57,480
Next story, Dark Sagra.

1349
01:16:58,840 --> 01:17:06,840
So, well, the game that everybody's playing, every fucking body playing.

1350
01:17:06,840 --> 01:17:07,240
Not me.

1351
01:17:07,960 --> 01:17:11,800
That I can't play is New World.

1352
01:17:12,440 --> 01:17:17,080
And I'm really surprised it's doing as well as it is.

1353
01:17:17,080 --> 01:17:19,480
I mean, they hit some kind of jackpot with it.

1354
01:17:22,040 --> 01:17:26,280
Basically, it's an MMORPG.

1355
01:17:30,200 --> 01:17:33,080
And it's doing well.

1356
01:17:33,160 --> 01:17:44,040
Basically, it is a colonization-themed game, but they've had things done to it to, I guess,

1357
01:17:44,040 --> 01:17:45,240
way tone that down.

1358
01:17:46,600 --> 01:17:58,280
They've brought in some tribal consultants to make things less offensive to Native Americans

1359
01:17:58,280 --> 01:17:59,960
and First Nations peoples.

1360
01:17:59,960 --> 01:18:02,920
This game's been delayed like six times before it came out.

1361
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:06,440
And I think this was one of the reasons they delayed it was to fix some of these story

1362
01:18:06,440 --> 01:18:06,920
problems.

1363
01:18:09,160 --> 01:18:18,840
But now New World has exceeded 750,000 concurrent players on Steam and is being watched by a

1364
01:18:18,840 --> 01:18:19,960
bunch of people on Twitch.

1365
01:18:19,960 --> 01:18:24,360
I mean, basically, the only times I'm actually watching the game is really just to chat with

1366
01:18:24,360 --> 01:18:30,040
my friends because I'm glad they're having a good time, but I really just hang out in

1367
01:18:30,040 --> 01:18:32,200
their channels just to hang out with my friends.

1368
01:18:33,320 --> 01:18:41,080
They haven't put out any sales figures yet, but it's been pretty popular.

1369
01:18:41,080 --> 01:18:42,840
They do have some really long queues.

1370
01:18:42,840 --> 01:18:50,360
I was hearing people complain about that, and there's already caps on, I guess, what

1371
01:18:50,360 --> 01:18:51,400
their guilds are.

1372
01:18:52,600 --> 01:18:54,360
I think it's like 100 members.

1373
01:18:54,360 --> 01:18:59,720
And I know that the one that a lot of our mutual friends are in has hit a cap.

1374
01:18:59,960 --> 01:19:08,760
Yeah, a lot of servers are full now, but it's the success story.

1375
01:19:08,760 --> 01:19:14,200
I mean, they announced three games in 2016, which was New World Breakaway and Crucible.

1376
01:19:15,880 --> 01:19:17,080
Breakaway was canceled.

1377
01:19:17,080 --> 01:19:20,840
Crucible was released, then removed, then canceled.

1378
01:19:22,360 --> 01:19:27,960
And then there were other games that under their code names, Nova and Intensity, that

1379
01:19:27,960 --> 01:19:30,920
were just dumped.

1380
01:19:30,920 --> 01:19:32,040
No rhyme or reason.

1381
01:19:32,760 --> 01:19:35,800
So this one does seem to be doing the trick.

1382
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:44,920
The reception is kind of mixed on the game, but the people who I talked to who are playing

1383
01:19:44,920 --> 01:19:47,480
it are really enjoying it, really getting into it.

1384
01:19:48,120 --> 01:19:57,400
There's actually a quote on here that they were...

1385
01:20:01,400 --> 01:20:03,480
I'm sorry, I completely lost my train of thought.

1386
01:20:03,480 --> 01:20:09,720
That the Amazon Studios were also having that sort of bro culture thing going on.

1387
01:20:11,240 --> 01:20:16,760
And then there were four different female game developers, so that their worst experiences

1388
01:20:16,840 --> 01:20:20,920
in sexism were at Amazon and being ignored and undermined.

1389
01:20:22,360 --> 01:20:29,720
Yeah, so that makes me not want to support the game, really.

1390
01:20:34,840 --> 01:20:37,400
But at the same time, I also can't.

1391
01:20:38,040 --> 01:20:43,080
Yeah, Amazon's kind of had miss after miss, and this was probably the title that was going

1392
01:20:43,080 --> 01:20:44,280
to make or break the studio.

1393
01:20:45,160 --> 01:20:47,960
And so it sounds like it's caution on the side of make.

1394
01:20:49,160 --> 01:20:53,160
However, obviously, these other issues that you brought up, these are things that Amazon

1395
01:20:53,160 --> 01:20:53,800
has to face.

1396
01:20:54,680 --> 01:20:59,560
I think they already have really had to, especially in the wake of everything else that's going

1397
01:20:59,560 --> 01:21:00,040
on.

1398
01:21:00,040 --> 01:21:02,120
I don't even think it made our show roll tonight.

1399
01:21:02,120 --> 01:21:05,880
But there was a pretty big development in that Activision Blizzard thing about how Blizzard

1400
01:21:05,880 --> 01:21:09,880
has to pay a lot of money, like $18 million out of this whole...

1401
01:21:09,880 --> 01:21:10,680
Well, it's actually not.

1402
01:21:10,680 --> 01:21:13,560
It's like a sixth of what Bobby Kotick makes in a year.

1403
01:21:13,560 --> 01:21:16,440
But they have to pay out this type of settlement and this sort of thing.

1404
01:21:16,440 --> 01:21:21,480
So I think every company that's being called out on this is having to take a look at that

1405
01:21:21,480 --> 01:21:22,520
sort of culture right now.

1406
01:21:23,080 --> 01:21:26,040
I don't know that we have this in the show role, but it's listed here.

1407
01:21:26,040 --> 01:21:26,280
Sure.

1408
01:21:26,920 --> 01:21:31,000
About Lara Miele, I think is how her last name is pronounced.

1409
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:32,920
Doesn't sound familiar.

1410
01:21:32,920 --> 01:21:35,960
Was promoted to a COO at EA.

1411
01:21:35,960 --> 01:21:36,600
Oh, interesting.

1412
01:21:37,240 --> 01:21:42,440
And according to this, and I'm going to quote, that effectively makes her the most powerful

1413
01:21:42,440 --> 01:21:43,960
woman in gaming by far.

1414
01:21:47,640 --> 01:21:50,520
Take-Two has a female CFO.

1415
01:21:52,120 --> 01:22:00,440
Miele manages EA's 20 plus studios, highest position that worked on corporate video game

1416
01:22:00,440 --> 01:22:00,920
strategy.

1417
01:22:01,560 --> 01:22:05,400
And it looks like, yeah, she's now the boss.

1418
01:22:06,360 --> 01:22:07,640
Chief operations officer.

1419
01:22:09,160 --> 01:22:09,720
Well, good for her.

1420
01:22:10,600 --> 01:22:11,560
And you know what's interesting?

1421
01:22:11,560 --> 01:22:16,360
EA is kind of like, with as much shit as they've gotten over the years, they're not really

1422
01:22:16,360 --> 01:22:18,920
being brought up in these conversations, which is a good thing.

1423
01:22:20,920 --> 01:22:22,840
You're not really hearing about problems at EA.

1424
01:22:22,840 --> 01:22:27,320
So hopefully that's a sign that they're doing something right in that regard, which should

1425
01:22:27,320 --> 01:22:29,080
be applauded and commended.

1426
01:22:29,080 --> 01:22:33,240
I'm not going to say it doesn't mean it isn't happening, but it seems we're not hearing

1427
01:22:33,240 --> 01:22:33,880
anything.

1428
01:22:33,880 --> 01:22:37,960
So back to the new world thing.

1429
01:22:38,760 --> 01:22:41,560
I've noticed a lot of streamers I watch her on this right now, too.

1430
01:22:41,560 --> 01:22:42,920
And that's cool.

1431
01:22:42,920 --> 01:22:45,400
I just can't pick up a second MMO right now.

1432
01:22:45,400 --> 01:22:49,240
There's an expansion less than 50 days away from SE 14.

1433
01:22:49,240 --> 01:22:50,600
I know I'm going to be into that.

1434
01:22:50,600 --> 01:22:51,880
That is what I play right now.

1435
01:22:55,080 --> 01:22:59,080
If I kind of wait till the end of the year, it allows a little time to see, does this

1436
01:22:59,080 --> 01:23:00,440
new world thing last?

1437
01:23:00,440 --> 01:23:02,040
Do people stick with it?

1438
01:23:02,040 --> 01:23:04,200
What quality of life changes do they implement?

1439
01:23:04,200 --> 01:23:08,600
And if people are still as enthused about new world at the end of the year as they are

1440
01:23:08,600 --> 01:23:11,480
now, then I'll probably consider it at that point.

1441
01:23:11,480 --> 01:23:14,840
That's kind of where my head is at with that whole thing.

1442
01:23:14,840 --> 01:23:16,280
So, all right.

1443
01:23:16,840 --> 01:23:18,280
I think we're going to move on to our next story.

1444
01:23:18,280 --> 01:23:20,600
Just to hedge up you guys, I'm going to go AFK for a minute.

1445
01:23:20,600 --> 01:23:20,840
Sorry.

1446
01:23:20,840 --> 01:23:22,200
So you might have to buy a little time.

1447
01:23:22,200 --> 01:23:24,840
So if you guys have random questions in chat, please ask them.

1448
01:23:24,840 --> 01:23:25,480
I'll be right back.

1449
01:23:28,520 --> 01:23:28,920
All right.

1450
01:23:29,240 --> 01:23:33,080
We need more reasons to be mad at Amazon.

1451
01:23:33,080 --> 01:23:39,480
Let's talk about how Amazon is scalping Xbox Series X consoles.

1452
01:23:40,920 --> 01:23:45,320
So, yes, this is actually a thing that's happening right now on Amazon.

1453
01:23:45,320 --> 01:23:51,160
So if you go to Amazon.com and you look for an Xbox Series X, you can see that they are

1454
01:23:51,160 --> 01:23:58,840
selling used consoles actually fulfilled through Amazon warehouse and by Amazon or sold by

1455
01:23:59,480 --> 01:24:06,360
warehouse and they're selling them at a markup of I mean, it's almost a thousand dollars.

1456
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:11,160
I think it was like nine hundred and eighty four dollars is what they had it listed as,

1457
01:24:12,520 --> 01:24:13,720
which is ridiculous.

1458
01:24:14,840 --> 01:24:17,560
Considering that's almost double the price for the console.

1459
01:24:18,120 --> 01:24:22,600
I mean, I suppose that they're well within the right to do that, but I just think it's

1460
01:24:22,600 --> 01:24:30,280
kind of a really scammy thing to be, you know, scalping consoles on your marketplace.

1461
01:24:30,840 --> 01:24:35,640
I can understand if a third party seller was doing that, but being that it's Amazon themselves.

1462
01:24:40,040 --> 01:24:40,600
I don't know.

1463
01:24:41,720 --> 01:24:51,000
So I don't know if Amazon's come out to say anything about, you know, comment on it or

1464
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:52,680
anything I doubt that they have.

1465
01:24:52,680 --> 01:24:58,600
But, you know, I think people are still biting the bullet and buying these consoles anyways,

1466
01:24:58,600 --> 01:25:02,600
even for this markup, because they don't know when they're going to be able to get one next at.

1467
01:25:02,600 --> 01:25:06,280
Well, certainly not at retail, but it's a captive audience almost.

1468
01:25:07,160 --> 01:25:07,560
It is.

1469
01:25:07,560 --> 01:25:10,840
I wouldn't be surprised if they're doing the same thing for the PlayStation five.

1470
01:25:12,200 --> 01:25:16,920
I haven't seen that yet, but it is kind of terrible that they're doing this.

1471
01:25:16,920 --> 01:25:20,760
At least I don't know why you would sell your used console to Amazon.

1472
01:25:20,760 --> 01:25:25,080
I know I've seen the advertisements on their site where they try to get you to sell used

1473
01:25:25,080 --> 01:25:27,320
console to them or trade it in or something like that.

1474
01:25:29,160 --> 01:25:35,480
But yeah, I would definitely be clear that let's not support them in this sense as it is.

1475
01:25:38,360 --> 01:25:39,160
Just be patient.

1476
01:25:40,600 --> 01:25:42,760
That's that's pretty much what I'm doing.

1477
01:25:42,760 --> 01:25:46,360
If I see something in the wild that I might want, that's hard to get,

1478
01:25:47,240 --> 01:25:48,200
then I'll go for it.

1479
01:25:48,520 --> 01:25:52,680
If I don't get it, then then say lovey, I save money.

1480
01:25:52,680 --> 01:25:56,360
Yeah, but Bobby, you say that this isn't Amazon selling them,

1481
01:25:56,360 --> 01:26:00,040
but it is saying that it is sold by Amazon Warehouse.

1482
01:26:00,040 --> 01:26:04,440
Now, I understand that Amazon, you know, they have a lot of like third party sellers that

1483
01:26:04,440 --> 01:26:06,520
fulfill through the warehouse.

1484
01:26:06,520 --> 01:26:11,080
But this is actually saying it's being sold by Amazon through Amazon Warehouse.

1485
01:26:11,960 --> 01:26:14,920
And I mean, it doesn't have another seller name on it.

1486
01:26:14,920 --> 01:26:19,640
Amazon Warehouse is they're kind of they do sell some wholesale stuff out of there,

1487
01:26:19,640 --> 01:26:22,600
like used, you know, stuff like that.

1488
01:26:22,600 --> 01:26:23,880
I open box maybe.

1489
01:26:23,880 --> 01:26:26,840
But I think this is actually Amazon in this case.

1490
01:26:28,600 --> 01:26:31,000
It doesn't says it doesn't have another store name on it.

1491
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:35,640
And all I see is Amazon for all the different, you know, the seller and where it's filled

1492
01:26:35,640 --> 01:26:35,960
through.

1493
01:26:35,960 --> 01:26:37,640
I'm assuming that it is Amazon.

1494
01:26:37,640 --> 01:26:46,440
No, but I guess I don't know.

1495
01:26:48,040 --> 01:26:53,320
I'll tell you what, I'm going to be Switzerland in this and I will just ask the source if

1496
01:26:53,320 --> 01:26:54,840
I really cared that much to know.

1497
01:26:56,920 --> 01:27:05,080
OK, yeah, but I guess Rob is still doing is doing his thing.

1498
01:27:05,080 --> 01:27:07,720
So, you know.

1499
01:27:09,240 --> 01:27:11,160
Well, my next thing is classic games.

1500
01:27:11,160 --> 01:27:14,440
So, yeah, sorry, I'm back.

1501
01:27:14,440 --> 01:27:14,940
Hi.

1502
01:27:15,400 --> 01:27:17,000
OK, welcome back.

1503
01:27:17,960 --> 01:27:18,600
Are we good to go?

1504
01:27:18,600 --> 01:27:19,480
Now it's my turn.

1505
01:27:20,280 --> 01:27:20,840
Oh, sorry.

1506
01:27:21,400 --> 01:27:23,080
Did you want to know?

1507
01:27:23,080 --> 01:27:25,640
No, no, it's my turn to go AFK and get chocolate.

1508
01:27:27,160 --> 01:27:29,480
How can I assume it's not Amazon selling this?

1509
01:27:29,480 --> 01:27:35,000
Because, I mean, it literally says, you know, that this is sold by Amazon Warehouse, ships

1510
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:36,120
from Amazon.com.

1511
01:27:36,120 --> 01:27:41,640
Like, I don't get how I would assume that this is a third party seller through Amazon

1512
01:27:41,640 --> 01:27:42,120
Warehouse.

1513
01:27:42,120 --> 01:27:46,760
I get like you can have a third party seller and they'll have their seller name sold by

1514
01:27:46,760 --> 01:27:52,440
this person, you know, ships from Amazon.com, whereas they store, you know, some of the

1515
01:27:52,440 --> 01:27:53,560
inventory for them.

1516
01:27:53,560 --> 01:27:57,160
They actually warehouse that and they ship it straight out of their warehouses.

1517
01:27:57,160 --> 01:28:02,040
But like, I don't know in this case, I don't know.

1518
01:28:02,040 --> 01:28:04,360
I don't think this is a third party seller in this sense.

1519
01:28:05,720 --> 01:28:09,880
Agree to disagree, I guess.

1520
01:28:09,880 --> 01:28:13,720
Why can't we just walk into Target and buy one of these off the shelf?

1521
01:28:13,720 --> 01:28:13,960
All right.

1522
01:28:13,960 --> 01:28:14,520
Yes, I know.

1523
01:28:14,520 --> 01:28:16,920
Yes, I know chip shortages, but it's just annoying.

1524
01:28:17,960 --> 01:28:18,280
All right.

1525
01:28:18,280 --> 01:28:20,280
I thought they were honest question.

1526
01:28:20,280 --> 01:28:24,680
I thought they were supposed to, like, pass legislation to, like, try to work on this

1527
01:28:24,680 --> 01:28:25,000
issue.

1528
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:27,320
Wasn't that a thing that they were talking about that they wanted to?

1529
01:28:28,040 --> 01:28:30,680
There's no legislation being passed anymore.

1530
01:28:30,680 --> 01:28:31,960
Yeah, I guess that's true.

1531
01:28:31,960 --> 01:28:32,520
Good point.

1532
01:28:32,520 --> 01:28:34,760
All right, moving on.

1533
01:28:34,760 --> 01:28:36,840
Well, at least we know this game's coming.

1534
01:28:36,840 --> 01:28:40,280
Monster Hunter Rise will be making its way to the PC.

1535
01:28:40,280 --> 01:28:43,720
It's going to come out on January 12th of 2022.

1536
01:28:45,080 --> 01:28:49,000
So apparently there's some collaborations that are going to be happening with that with

1537
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:51,880
ghosts and goblins and Sonic the Hedgehog.

1538
01:28:52,520 --> 01:28:55,560
How Sonic the Hedgehog and Monster Hunter are going to come together.

1539
01:28:55,560 --> 01:28:57,480
I'm not sure that could be very interesting, though.

1540
01:28:58,360 --> 01:28:59,080
But anyhow.

1541
01:29:01,560 --> 01:29:04,520
There's also an expansion that's on its way.

1542
01:29:04,520 --> 01:29:06,040
Monster Hunter Rise Sunbreak.

1543
01:29:06,040 --> 01:29:09,960
I think we saw that in the latest Nintendo Direct, and that will be on its way to the

1544
01:29:09,960 --> 01:29:11,320
PC version as well.

1545
01:29:11,320 --> 01:29:14,120
That's due out summer of 2022.

1546
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:21,880
The Ghosts and Goblins collaboration, the Brave Knight Arthur from Ghosts and Goblins

1547
01:29:21,880 --> 01:29:23,560
will be in the game.

1548
01:29:23,560 --> 01:29:29,240
After you complete an event quest, you can take on Arthur's iconic armor and the throwing

1549
01:29:29,240 --> 01:29:31,240
knives transform into lances.

1550
01:29:31,240 --> 01:29:34,760
So I guess you just go around kind of like you're Arthur, even though you're not actually

1551
01:29:34,760 --> 01:29:35,080
Arthur.

1552
01:29:35,080 --> 01:29:35,720
That's interesting.

1553
01:29:36,520 --> 01:29:41,160
And as far as the details for Sonic the Hedgehog and the 30th anniversary, which I guess is

1554
01:29:41,160 --> 01:29:46,920
also next year, all they're saying is it's happening and the event quest will be out

1555
01:29:46,920 --> 01:29:47,880
in November.

1556
01:29:47,880 --> 01:29:49,720
So that's a ways out.

1557
01:29:49,720 --> 01:29:51,960
So very interesting with that.

1558
01:29:54,920 --> 01:30:00,200
I'm sure there will be some people that will be excited to check that out on the PC when

1559
01:30:00,200 --> 01:30:03,960
that comes out, because it's probably going to look a little better than it does on the

1560
01:30:03,960 --> 01:30:04,840
Switch.

1561
01:30:04,840 --> 01:30:07,640
You know, just especially if you have a beefy PC, we'll see.

1562
01:30:08,280 --> 01:30:11,960
So all right, let's move on.

1563
01:30:12,600 --> 01:30:19,560
We're going to go to a good old classic segment here, and we won't talk about shiny new PC

1564
01:30:19,560 --> 01:30:22,360
games, but we'll talk about some weird things.

1565
01:30:22,360 --> 01:30:23,400
Fucking weird games.

1566
01:30:23,400 --> 01:30:23,960
That's right.

1567
01:30:23,960 --> 01:30:27,000
Let's get to this next segment with this little interlude.

1568
01:30:30,200 --> 01:30:44,760
And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time, where I'll dive into the vault and pull

1569
01:30:44,760 --> 01:30:47,080
out a classic and tell you about it.

1570
01:30:47,080 --> 01:30:49,720
It's time for the classic game of the week.

1571
01:30:51,320 --> 01:30:54,600
This is one big flag, Dark Sakura.

1572
01:30:54,600 --> 01:30:56,360
What did you pick for the flag tonight?

1573
01:30:57,320 --> 01:30:59,880
I picked the SEGA toilet.

1574
01:30:59,880 --> 01:31:01,320
T-O-Y-L-E-T.

1575
01:31:04,120 --> 01:31:07,080
If you're not familiar with what this...

1576
01:31:07,080 --> 01:31:09,320
I can't stop laughing because it's so stupid.

1577
01:31:11,800 --> 01:31:17,240
So they have a little game system at urinals.

1578
01:31:17,880 --> 01:31:21,400
First of all, why's it got to be just for the dick possessing?

1579
01:31:21,400 --> 01:31:22,280
I'm sorry.

1580
01:31:22,280 --> 01:31:24,600
That's sexist as all fuck.

1581
01:31:25,560 --> 01:31:30,280
But it's an interactive urinal system that was developed by SEGA AM1.

1582
01:31:31,480 --> 01:31:35,000
They have LCD screens and pressure sensors.

1583
01:31:35,640 --> 01:31:40,520
They do show like ads between the games, but basically you can play the games and store

1584
01:31:40,520 --> 01:31:43,400
your score on a flash drive.

1585
01:31:45,560 --> 01:31:53,080
They are installed in four stations for Tokyo Metro, including Akihabara, Soga, and Ikebukuro.

1586
01:31:53,320 --> 01:32:02,120
There also were some in Tokyo, Joypolis, so the different minigames on them is one called

1587
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:10,120
Manic and Piss, which is basically named after the statue of the urinating boy from Brussels.

1588
01:32:11,880 --> 01:32:13,640
Seeing just how hard you can pee.

1589
01:32:14,360 --> 01:32:19,800
There's Graffiti Eraser, where you're going to use your pee to power wash.

1590
01:32:20,360 --> 01:32:22,120
Power washing simulator, y'all.

1591
01:32:22,120 --> 01:32:22,620
No.

1592
01:32:24,360 --> 01:32:32,120
There's one called The North Wind, The Sun, and Me, where you are playing the wind trying

1593
01:32:32,120 --> 01:32:36,440
to lift a girl's skirt by blowing air at her.

1594
01:32:36,440 --> 01:32:38,440
Fucking sexist garbage.

1595
01:32:39,320 --> 01:32:42,440
The strength of the wind is how forceful the pee is.

1596
01:32:43,560 --> 01:32:48,440
And then there's Battle Milk from Nose, where you complete a battle for the nose.

1597
01:32:48,920 --> 01:32:55,240
Where you complete against the person who last used the urinal to compare how strong

1598
01:32:55,240 --> 01:32:56,520
your pee stream is.

1599
01:32:57,880 --> 01:33:03,160
They are represented on screen as jets of milk squirting out of the noses of two characters

1600
01:33:03,160 --> 01:33:04,440
standing in a sumo ring.

1601
01:33:05,240 --> 01:33:07,720
And if you pee harder, you win.

1602
01:33:07,720 --> 01:33:09,800
You knock the opponent out of the ring.

1603
01:33:10,520 --> 01:33:16,040
This is the most stupid thing I've ever heard, especially how sexist these are.

1604
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:27,480
Um, so there also are a few other types of interactive urinal things, not just by Sega.

1605
01:33:28,440 --> 01:33:35,080
There's a British company called Captive Media that installed them.

1606
01:33:35,800 --> 01:33:39,320
They also use infrared detection for temperature.

1607
01:33:39,320 --> 01:33:40,440
So it's kind of weird.

1608
01:33:41,240 --> 01:33:47,320
But they have them installed at the exhibit in Ballum, London.

1609
01:33:47,400 --> 01:33:50,520
And Tabushbar in Cambridge.

1610
01:33:51,400 --> 01:33:56,360
So you basically use your pee as a directional thing.

1611
01:33:56,360 --> 01:34:00,680
One's called On the Piest, which is a skiing game where you knock over penguins.

1612
01:34:01,880 --> 01:34:05,000
And another one called Clever Dick, which is a pub quiz game.

1613
01:34:06,040 --> 01:34:08,360
You have to answer true or false with your pee.

1614
01:34:11,560 --> 01:34:12,360
There's a few others.

1615
01:34:12,360 --> 01:34:16,920
One's called Place to Pee that was formerly called Pee Station.

1616
01:34:16,920 --> 01:34:20,520
Sorry, Plee Station, which Plee means toilet in Dutch.

1617
01:34:20,520 --> 01:34:22,440
I think Pee Station would have been funnier.

1618
01:34:23,560 --> 01:34:31,320
But it's more interactive pissing in the terminal.

1619
01:34:31,880 --> 01:34:36,520
There's also called the Interactive Urinal Communicator, which is an advertising device.

1620
01:34:39,400 --> 01:34:44,760
And it basically is just trying to sell you shit with your pee.

1621
01:34:45,560 --> 01:34:49,560
But of course, the best of them all is the Sega toilet,

1622
01:34:50,280 --> 01:34:52,920
because they're terrible humans who came up with this.

1623
01:34:54,040 --> 01:34:54,600
And that's it.

1624
01:34:56,760 --> 01:35:01,320
Seriously, install a Nintendo in the ladies room, please.

1625
01:35:02,680 --> 01:35:05,080
Did you say it sells you shit with your pee?

1626
01:35:05,080 --> 01:35:08,360
Like, I'm reminded of that South Park episode, the poo that took a pee.

1627
01:35:10,040 --> 01:35:10,760
Anyone?

1628
01:35:10,760 --> 01:35:17,480
It it's it's just it's novel, which is why I did it.

1629
01:35:18,040 --> 01:35:20,520
But at the same time, it is intensely sexist.

1630
01:35:20,520 --> 01:35:23,000
It's just I I'm exhausted.

1631
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:25,160
Like this whole segment has made me exhausted.

1632
01:35:27,160 --> 01:35:35,320
I don't understand what if you're going to pee, why it should be made into a game?

1633
01:35:37,400 --> 01:35:39,400
How long are people peeing for?

1634
01:35:39,400 --> 01:35:42,760
Next year, we're going to have like the poop strength test or something.

1635
01:35:43,720 --> 01:35:46,680
The bigger shit you lay, the higher score you get.

1636
01:35:47,720 --> 01:35:52,760
I'm trying to think of places I want to be less than a public restroom.

1637
01:35:54,440 --> 01:36:00,040
Not to mention, like, you know, like flashing screen images and sounds are just going to

1638
01:36:00,040 --> 01:36:03,640
draw the attention of the person next to you to look at your screens.

1639
01:36:03,640 --> 01:36:05,960
Like, I'm sorry, that's even more uncomfortable.

1640
01:36:05,960 --> 01:36:08,360
Is peeing in Japan naturally competitive?

1641
01:36:09,480 --> 01:36:10,040
I don't know.

1642
01:36:10,040 --> 01:36:11,560
Everything is competitive.

1643
01:36:11,560 --> 01:36:12,440
That's the stereotype.

1644
01:36:13,080 --> 01:36:17,800
Tiger Claw in chat says this is something they should probably add in movie theater restrooms,

1645
01:36:17,800 --> 01:36:21,480
because you can probably get a really good score because of all the pee you had to hold

1646
01:36:21,480 --> 01:36:22,840
in while watching a movie.

1647
01:36:22,840 --> 01:36:26,520
While I completely understand and respect your logic, Tiger Claw, I don't ever want

1648
01:36:26,520 --> 01:36:27,240
to see this again.

1649
01:36:28,680 --> 01:36:32,600
No, nobody should consider putting this anywhere in the trash.

1650
01:36:32,600 --> 01:36:33,320
That's where it should go.

1651
01:36:33,880 --> 01:36:34,680
The bin.

1652
01:36:34,680 --> 01:36:35,480
Put it in the bin.

1653
01:36:36,200 --> 01:36:40,920
That's where Mommy is feverishly writing down these ideas for their next game.

1654
01:36:42,120 --> 01:36:43,480
All I can say is no.

1655
01:36:47,400 --> 01:36:48,520
Anyway, the answer is no.

1656
01:36:49,240 --> 01:36:49,800
There it is.

1657
01:36:50,440 --> 01:36:52,360
Your fucking weird arcade game of the month.

1658
01:36:52,360 --> 01:36:53,480
And boy, is it weird.

1659
01:36:54,440 --> 01:36:55,960
The Toylet.

1660
01:36:56,760 --> 01:36:58,920
That's T-O-Y-L-E-T.

1661
01:37:01,240 --> 01:37:04,360
Dark Tetsuya says this is in Yakuza 2, apparently, of course.

1662
01:37:04,360 --> 01:37:05,000
Of course it is.

1663
01:37:05,480 --> 01:37:07,800
All right, let's move on.

1664
01:37:07,800 --> 01:37:09,080
Let's let's travel around.

1665
01:37:09,080 --> 01:37:10,760
Let's cleanse the palette, please.

1666
01:37:10,760 --> 01:37:15,240
Let's let's wash that segment away with some rapid fire news.

1667
01:37:15,800 --> 01:37:18,520
Let's let's let's flush on to our next segment.

1668
01:37:18,520 --> 01:37:19,020
Loki.

1669
01:37:20,120 --> 01:37:29,160
So D3 has announced that Earth Defense 4 6 has been delayed to 2022, to which I say

1670
01:37:29,160 --> 01:37:32,040
I forgot that there was Earth Defense 4 6 coming out.

1671
01:37:32,040 --> 01:37:36,680
Also, they all look the same, and I really wish they would innovate on their game because

1672
01:37:36,680 --> 01:37:40,120
it's like literally the same game that they've released six times now.

1673
01:37:40,120 --> 01:37:43,160
Quite the read coming from you because you're a fan of that franchise normally.

1674
01:37:43,160 --> 01:37:43,720
I am.

1675
01:37:43,720 --> 01:37:47,480
It's stupid fun, but like their games look all the same.

1676
01:37:47,480 --> 01:37:51,080
Like it's always the same, like always the same.

1677
01:37:51,080 --> 01:37:54,200
I just wish they would do something different with it.

1678
01:37:55,320 --> 01:37:56,360
Whatever, it's fine.

1679
01:37:57,560 --> 01:38:01,160
And then speaking of companies not doing anything different,

1680
01:38:02,440 --> 01:38:08,040
apparently still, even though we kind of figured that it's coming, the Grand Theft Auto, the

1681
01:38:08,040 --> 01:38:12,280
trilogy Definitive Edition has popped up on the Korean ratings board.

1682
01:38:12,920 --> 01:38:17,240
And yeah, indicating that, yes, it's probably coming out soon.

1683
01:38:18,760 --> 01:38:20,920
Don't care that it's coming out soon.

1684
01:38:20,920 --> 01:38:23,800
Wish Rockstar Games would do something different, please.

1685
01:38:24,360 --> 01:38:24,860
Thank you.

1686
01:38:25,800 --> 01:38:27,000
Release a new game, please.

1687
01:38:28,200 --> 01:38:29,000
It's been years.

1688
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:31,400
You take a new table tennis at this point, right?

1689
01:38:31,400 --> 01:38:33,560
Like it's been it's been absolute.

1690
01:38:33,560 --> 01:38:37,800
I would not take a new table tennis game, but like I get it.

1691
01:38:37,800 --> 01:38:39,000
Red Dead Redemption 2.

1692
01:38:39,800 --> 01:38:43,000
Pretty great game, but it's still been years since that's come out, too.

1693
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:45,160
So like we're ready for a new game.

1694
01:38:46,280 --> 01:38:47,320
All right, please.

1695
01:38:48,040 --> 01:38:48,600
Moving on.

1696
01:38:48,600 --> 01:38:49,640
Dark Sakura, what do you have?

1697
01:38:53,400 --> 01:38:54,920
Besides the mute button pressed.

1698
01:38:54,920 --> 01:38:56,600
I'm hitting it and I said, oh, shit.

1699
01:38:56,600 --> 01:38:57,400
So that's what.

1700
01:38:59,160 --> 01:39:00,840
Konami is doing something cool.

1701
01:39:01,080 --> 01:39:03,320
They want money, so this is a cool thing.

1702
01:39:03,320 --> 01:39:07,560
They're doing a Castlevania soundtrack collection in December.

1703
01:39:08,920 --> 01:39:12,680
It is actually the orders are already up for it.

1704
01:39:12,680 --> 01:39:14,680
It started September 27th.

1705
01:39:15,400 --> 01:39:22,280
If you order them, you will also get a special 14 track CD that has the midi

1706
01:39:22,280 --> 01:39:24,840
arrangements of songs from Castlevania Dracula X.

1707
01:39:25,720 --> 01:39:31,560
And there are four graphic T-shirt designs on Amazon Japan,

1708
01:39:33,160 --> 01:39:34,840
which I may have to look at.

1709
01:39:34,840 --> 01:39:39,480
And this is it's so many discs, y'all.

1710
01:39:39,480 --> 01:39:40,440
It's so many.

1711
01:39:41,640 --> 01:39:45,160
There's like two sets full of delightfulness.

1712
01:39:46,040 --> 01:39:46,840
And I want it.

1713
01:39:48,040 --> 01:39:52,120
The release date for this will be December 15th, 2021 in Japan.

1714
01:39:55,000 --> 01:40:01,080
Also, Castlevania Grimoire of Souls is back in Apple Arcade as an exclusive.

1715
01:40:01,080 --> 01:40:02,840
So I might start streaming that.

1716
01:40:05,560 --> 01:40:09,560
Also, the holodeck is happening, Rob.

1717
01:40:12,600 --> 01:40:14,360
Everything we do in gaming is one step closer.

1718
01:40:15,400 --> 01:40:19,240
Well, now there's this thing called the Dream Cube.

1719
01:40:20,200 --> 01:40:27,400
That is it's like a I mean, really, it's like a room with different screens in it,

1720
01:40:27,400 --> 01:40:29,160
but I can only see this getting better.

1721
01:40:31,160 --> 01:40:38,040
Like there's one that's like playing soccer football where you actually kick

1722
01:40:38,040 --> 01:40:39,160
your ball at targets.

1723
01:40:40,280 --> 01:40:41,400
It's a giant video game.

1724
01:40:41,400 --> 01:40:47,160
I mean, you could you kick it right into the wall as hard as you want to.

1725
01:40:47,320 --> 01:40:53,880
Basically, you know, they are already signing deals with the NBA and Manchester United.

1726
01:40:55,880 --> 01:41:00,520
There are already 16 Dream Cubes that are set up for the Manchester U fans

1727
01:41:01,160 --> 01:41:03,080
United across China.

1728
01:41:04,200 --> 01:41:10,840
It's a 256 square foot virtual reality room, like an interactive cubicle.

1729
01:41:11,640 --> 01:41:16,520
You're in VR with no headset, which honestly,

1730
01:41:16,520 --> 01:41:19,000
it sounds to me like I would just get super motion sick in it,

1731
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:21,960
but it is closer to the holodeck.

1732
01:41:23,320 --> 01:41:27,160
It moves pixels at 240 frames a second,

1733
01:41:28,680 --> 01:41:32,920
which is like four to eight times as much as most video games.

1734
01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:37,560
You've got like karaoke things in there.

1735
01:41:37,560 --> 01:41:41,960
You have the back wall is left open so that your friends can watch

1736
01:41:41,960 --> 01:41:43,560
or swap in on some of those things.

1737
01:41:44,280 --> 01:41:47,480
But it has all the head tracking.

1738
01:41:47,480 --> 01:41:49,080
It's pretty interesting.

1739
01:41:50,360 --> 01:41:57,720
It started development in 1992 when the University of Illinois developed the CAVE,

1740
01:41:57,720 --> 01:42:00,200
which is Cave Automatic Immersion Environment,

1741
01:42:00,840 --> 01:42:01,800
and it's gone from there.

1742
01:42:02,600 --> 01:42:04,440
So keep your eyes open.

1743
01:42:04,440 --> 01:42:05,320
We're getting close to home.

1744
01:42:05,320 --> 01:42:07,080
There's even like a graffiti mode.

1745
01:42:07,080 --> 01:42:07,720
That's fun.

1746
01:42:09,480 --> 01:42:13,720
So, yeah, can I clean up the graffiti of my urine strains?

1747
01:42:13,720 --> 01:42:15,160
That's a really good question.

1748
01:42:15,160 --> 01:42:18,520
Or my power washer, whichever you prefer.

1749
01:42:20,920 --> 01:42:21,640
I hate it here.

1750
01:42:21,640 --> 01:42:23,640
Dark Sakura is looking for the eject button.

1751
01:42:24,840 --> 01:42:25,560
I hate it here.

1752
01:42:26,840 --> 01:42:27,640
No, you don't.

1753
01:42:31,000 --> 01:42:35,400
Bobby Black Wolf says the 240 frames per second will help you not get sick.

1754
01:42:35,400 --> 01:42:38,120
Yeah, I guess that'll help a little bit with some of that.

1755
01:42:38,120 --> 01:42:38,620
Maybe.

1756
01:42:39,240 --> 01:42:39,740
Maybe.

1757
01:42:41,080 --> 01:42:41,560
That's right.

1758
01:42:41,560 --> 01:42:45,160
I'm only interested in this thing if I can play power washing simulator

1759
01:42:45,160 --> 01:42:48,680
with a power washer, not what Loki was referring to.

1760
01:42:48,680 --> 01:42:50,200
I never want that brought up again.

1761
01:42:50,200 --> 01:42:52,520
They really do need a VR mode for that game.

1762
01:42:53,080 --> 01:42:54,280
I would be down.

1763
01:42:54,280 --> 01:42:58,600
Yeah, while I'm usually against like we don't have to VR everything.

1764
01:42:59,480 --> 01:43:00,760
That one would be kind of fun.

1765
01:43:00,760 --> 01:43:01,640
Yeah, it'll be fun.

1766
01:43:01,640 --> 01:43:02,140
All right.

1767
01:43:02,700 --> 01:43:05,500
Um, if that was it, I think it was.

1768
01:43:05,500 --> 01:43:09,260
Let's go to our world release dates, and we're going to travel around the world

1769
01:43:09,260 --> 01:43:12,220
and check out some releases coming out quite soon.

1770
01:43:14,220 --> 01:43:15,260
Loki, what's out this week?

1771
01:43:16,300 --> 01:43:21,340
So this week we've got, it looks like a Hell Let Loose,

1772
01:43:21,980 --> 01:43:26,860
and that is on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X.

1773
01:43:26,860 --> 01:43:33,260
Alan Wake Remastered on PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One and Xbox Series X.

1774
01:43:34,060 --> 01:43:38,540
BPM Bullets Per Minute, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One on that.

1775

1777
01:43:52,780 --> 01:43:55,660
Lego Marvel Super Heroes on Nintendo Switch,

1778
01:43:55,660 --> 01:43:58,060
which is weird because I swear to God that game's already out.

1779
01:43:58,780 --> 01:44:01,100
I guess that's the original one that they're bringing back.

1780
01:44:01,900 --> 01:44:02,620
That's super old.

1781
01:44:03,820 --> 01:44:05,580
This one's actually very exciting.

1782
01:44:05,580 --> 01:44:12,300
Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One,

1783
01:44:12,300 --> 01:44:13,980
Xbox Series X.

1784
01:44:13,980 --> 01:44:15,340
Very excited to see that one.

1785
01:44:16,140 --> 01:44:23,180
Super Monkey Ball Banana Mania on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One,

1789
01:44:39,900 --> 01:44:40,300
That's it.

1790
01:44:40,300 --> 01:44:41,260
This is a busy week.

1791
01:44:41,900 --> 01:44:42,860
It is a busy week.

1792
01:44:42,860 --> 01:44:44,780
A lot of these releases like snuck up on us.

1793
01:44:45,580 --> 01:44:48,620
I forgot that Nickelodeon thing was happening so soon.

1794
01:44:48,620 --> 01:44:50,300
We are in the fourth quarter.

1795
01:44:50,300 --> 01:44:53,980
I know I knew Metroid was October, but I forgot it was like early October.

1796
01:44:53,980 --> 01:44:56,860
Like, you know, we're giving a lot this week.

1797
01:44:56,860 --> 01:44:59,900
And I should mention, though, you probably won't ever find one.

1798
01:44:59,900 --> 01:45:02,380
The Nintendo Switch OLED is also coming out this week.

1799
01:45:03,260 --> 01:45:04,860
Good luck if you're going after one of those.

1800
01:45:05,980 --> 01:45:07,740
Let's go to Japan right now.

1801
01:45:07,740 --> 01:45:08,380
Get on the plane.

1802
01:45:09,500 --> 01:45:11,820
Japanese releases this week on the Nintendo Switch.

1803
01:45:12,700 --> 01:45:17,340
Shuen no Verce Error Salvation in regular and limited edition.

1804
01:45:18,060 --> 01:45:19,340
Super Monkey Ball.

1805
01:45:19,340 --> 01:45:22,220
It's in English, but it is getting an official Japanese release.

1806
01:45:22,220 --> 01:45:24,300
That is this week as well on the Switch.

1807
01:45:24,300 --> 01:45:28,860
Lyrica and Lyrica 2 Stars Align in a regular and limited edition.

1808
01:45:28,860 --> 01:45:32,380
Doki Doki Literature Club Plus is out this week as well.

1809
01:45:32,380 --> 01:45:35,580
Astrea Ascending in a regular and limited edition.

1810
01:45:35,580 --> 01:45:37,340
Or excuse me, regular and special edition.

1811
01:45:37,340 --> 01:45:38,460
That's really the same thing.

1812
01:45:38,460 --> 01:45:39,980
Also out this week in Japan.

1813
01:45:39,980 --> 01:45:46,940
And of course, the OLED Nintendo Switch also out this week in Japan, as is Metroid Dread

1814
01:45:46,940 --> 01:45:50,860
is getting a release along with all the amiibo that come with it as well.

1815
01:45:50,860 --> 01:45:55,420
So it's a very, very busy week with the hardware release and all that stuff in Japan.

1816
01:45:55,420 --> 01:45:59,660
So those of you that like to import, you know, maybe you're going to pick up one of the cool

1817
01:45:59,660 --> 01:46:00,300
little limited.

1818
01:46:00,860 --> 01:46:04,140
I don't think they have anything that special we don't have here, but there's a lot of peripherals

1819
01:46:04,140 --> 01:46:04,780
and things like that.

1820
01:46:04,780 --> 01:46:09,020
And like the third party cases and stuff that might be a little harder to find here.

1821
01:46:09,980 --> 01:46:12,060
Quickly seeing what's going on on the PlayStation 5.

1822
01:46:12,060 --> 01:46:13,740
It's a big week for the Switch.

1823
01:46:13,740 --> 01:46:15,660
But the PlayStation 5 has a few things as well.

1824
01:46:16,700 --> 01:46:20,700
The Super Monkey Ball I talked about earlier is also out on PS5.

1825
01:46:20,700 --> 01:46:25,660
Doki Doki Literature Club Plus, as well as Astrea Ascending in regular and limited edition

1826
01:46:25,660 --> 01:46:26,620
is out this week.

1827
01:46:26,620 --> 01:46:30,060
Far Cry 6 gets a Japanese release this week as well.

1828
01:46:30,060 --> 01:46:35,260
And Back 4 Blood is something to look out for also in Japan this week on the 8th.

1829
01:46:36,220 --> 01:46:37,580
Dark Sakura, how about Europe?

1830
01:46:38,220 --> 01:46:43,180
We have on the 5th, we have Alan Wake Remastered.

1831
01:46:43,180 --> 01:46:45,500
We have Super Monkey Ball, Banana Mania.

1832
01:46:46,220 --> 01:46:48,620
We have on the 7th, Far Cry 6.

1833
01:46:49,180 --> 01:46:55,340
On the 8th, Knockout Home Fitness, Metroid Dread, Alpaca Ball All-Stars.

1834
01:46:55,340 --> 01:46:56,300
Sounds adorable.

1835
01:46:57,100 --> 01:46:59,500
Back 4 Blood Deluxe Edition.

1836
01:47:00,140 --> 01:47:02,380
And that's it for this week.

1837
01:47:03,740 --> 01:47:04,220
All right.

1838
01:47:05,100 --> 01:47:11,900
E3VL in our chat over at twitch.tv slash vognetwork says, don't forget, Emi, last character DLC

1839
01:47:11,900 --> 01:47:13,340
for Smash Brothers Ultimate.

1840
01:47:13,340 --> 01:47:15,340
Do we get that reveal this week as well?

1841
01:47:15,980 --> 01:47:17,180
It's October 8th, right?

1842
01:47:18,060 --> 01:47:19,820
So we'll know that before our next show.

1843
01:47:19,820 --> 01:47:21,100
Oh, that's exciting.

1844
01:47:21,100 --> 01:47:21,900
I wonder what that's.

1845
01:47:22,540 --> 01:47:29,020
Although I disagree with E3VL on who it will be, but it could literally be anything.

1846
01:47:29,980 --> 01:47:34,380
Your suggestion has just as much of a chance as anyone else's.

1847
01:47:34,380 --> 01:47:35,100
So there's that.

1848
01:47:35,100 --> 01:47:36,140
Oh, it's October 5th.

1849
01:47:36,140 --> 01:47:37,420
It's even sooner.

1850
01:47:37,420 --> 01:47:40,540
So gosh, we're going to know real soon who that last character is.

1851
01:47:40,540 --> 01:47:45,740
And everybody's going to say, boy, Sakurai gave in to Waluigi.

1852
01:47:45,740 --> 01:47:46,380
What did you say?

1853
01:47:47,340 --> 01:47:51,420
I don't remember when the Nintendo Direct for the Animal Crossing stuff was.

1854
01:47:51,420 --> 01:47:53,020
I think that's around the same time too.

1855
01:47:53,660 --> 01:47:55,980
Maybe that's the one that was on the 8th that I was mixing up.

1856
01:47:55,980 --> 01:47:56,540
Maybe.

1857
01:47:56,540 --> 01:47:57,040
Maybe.

1858
01:47:57,600 --> 01:48:00,000
So yeah, we're going to get a lot of big Nintendo updates this week.

1859
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:01,040
This is a big week for Nintendo.

1860
01:48:01,040 --> 01:48:04,480
I mean, technically the OLED Switch is a bit of a new system.

1861
01:48:04,480 --> 01:48:08,560
I mean, it's, you know, E3VL says they did not announce a date.

1862
01:48:08,560 --> 01:48:09,760
And Mike Def's confirming that.

1863
01:48:09,760 --> 01:48:11,440
So they just said October.

1864
01:48:11,440 --> 01:48:13,200
They gave the vague window.

1865
01:48:13,200 --> 01:48:15,360
Maybe they'll announce a date on this one.

1866
01:48:16,720 --> 01:48:17,600
I wouldn't plan on it.

1867
01:48:18,960 --> 01:48:22,320
If Nintendo's proven anything, it's that they can announce it the night before.

1868
01:48:22,320 --> 01:48:23,920
And the internet will still be talking about it.

1869
01:48:23,920 --> 01:48:24,480
It doesn't matter.

1870
01:48:25,120 --> 01:48:27,280
They'll be like, wait, Animal Crossing Direct.

1871
01:48:27,280 --> 01:48:29,040
Why didn't you announce a new Zelda game?

1872
01:48:31,200 --> 01:48:32,240
That'll be Twitter's job.

1873
01:48:32,240 --> 01:48:32,880
Of course it will.

1874
01:48:33,920 --> 01:48:36,080
All right, let's get back into some other news.

1875
01:48:36,080 --> 01:48:36,580
Loki.

1876
01:48:38,480 --> 01:48:38,880
All right.

1877
01:48:38,880 --> 01:48:44,800
Well, speaking of console shortages, we're getting word or at least, I guess, reassurances

1878
01:48:44,800 --> 01:48:52,160
from Xbox VP of gaming, Phil Spencer, that it's not going to be easy to find consoles

1879
01:48:52,160 --> 01:48:53,120
anytime soon.

1880
01:48:53,200 --> 01:48:58,480
So they're saying that they're expecting the console shortage to go into 2022 because,

1881
01:48:58,480 --> 01:49:00,800
of course, chip shortages.

1882
01:49:00,800 --> 01:49:07,360
And unfortunately, it is something that's going to be not resolved definitely this calendar

1883
01:49:07,360 --> 01:49:11,200
year and most likely probably going well into next calendar year.

1884
01:49:12,560 --> 01:49:14,800
So, I mean, you probably already knew that.

1885
01:49:17,280 --> 01:49:21,680
Well, it's still sad to hear that reality, especially with another holiday season.

1886
01:49:21,680 --> 01:49:22,320
I mean, think about it.

1887
01:49:22,320 --> 01:49:25,760
This will be the third Christmas that those systems are impossible to get.

1888
01:49:26,640 --> 01:49:29,840
Yeah, I don't like being reminded that, you know.

1889
01:49:31,840 --> 01:49:36,560
That there's still console shortages out there, I guess, but it'd be nice to have a PlayStation

1890
01:49:36,560 --> 01:49:38,160
five, but I'm in no hurry.

1891
01:49:38,720 --> 01:49:39,920
Yeah, I'm at that point as well.

1892
01:49:39,920 --> 01:49:41,920
It's like, I'll just get one when I get one.

1893
01:49:41,920 --> 01:49:42,420
Whatever.

1894
01:49:43,280 --> 01:49:43,780
All right.

1895
01:49:44,640 --> 01:49:47,520
Uh, Bobby said we had two Christmases since November 20.

1896
01:49:48,080 --> 01:49:49,040
Why can't I math?

1897
01:49:49,040 --> 01:49:49,440
You're right.

1898
01:49:49,440 --> 01:49:51,040
This is the only the second Christmas.

1899
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:55,680
In my head, we've been talking, I'm staring at 2022 on the screen.

1900
01:49:55,680 --> 01:49:57,520
And so my brain is going that way.

1901
01:49:57,520 --> 01:49:59,680
No, you're I can't map today.

1902
01:49:59,680 --> 01:50:00,640
You got it.

1903
01:50:00,640 --> 01:50:05,680
But still, even the fact that it's a second Christmas and who knows if they say it's continuing

1904
01:50:05,680 --> 01:50:09,040
into 2022, maybe we are looking at three Christmases.

1905
01:50:09,040 --> 01:50:10,400
Maybe I'm not wrong yet.

1906
01:50:11,600 --> 01:50:15,760
So, yeah, I mean, we're going to have all those consoles that are going to get scalped

1907
01:50:15,760 --> 01:50:19,120
and then Amazon will flip them for $3,000 each.

1908
01:50:21,040 --> 01:50:21,520
All right.

1909
01:50:21,520 --> 01:50:25,520
To pay for their, you know, their Twitch promotions.

1910
01:50:27,600 --> 01:50:28,000
All right.

1911
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:31,840
Well, something that's going to be trying to come back to some sense of normalcy is

1912
01:50:31,840 --> 01:50:33,040
the Game Awards.

1913
01:50:33,040 --> 01:50:36,640
The Game Awards, where, of course, they announce, you know, Jeff Keighley is pretty good at

1914
01:50:36,640 --> 01:50:40,000
getting a lot of good big winner announcements and trailers and things like that.

1915
01:50:40,640 --> 01:50:42,240
It's going to be happening in person.

1916
01:50:42,960 --> 01:50:48,080
The ceremony is going to happen December 9th in Los Angeles, live and in person.

1917
01:50:48,080 --> 01:50:49,840
It's going to happen at the Microsoft Theater.

1918
01:50:51,040 --> 01:50:55,440
And no word yet on any type of COVID precautions.

1919
01:50:55,440 --> 01:50:56,960
Maybe they're kind of banking.

1920
01:50:56,960 --> 01:50:59,200
The numbers are going down and it's December.

1921
01:50:59,200 --> 01:51:00,080
So maybe they won't.

1922
01:51:00,080 --> 01:51:04,480
And it is it's being held in California, which has a lot of strict stuff anyway.

1923
01:51:04,480 --> 01:51:08,320
As I was talking about before, I imagine they're going to require vaccines to get in.

1924
01:51:08,320 --> 01:51:11,920
That's going to like that's going to be a no brainer for something like this in California

1925
01:51:11,920 --> 01:51:13,760
in L.A. Oh, it's L.A. County.

1926
01:51:13,760 --> 01:51:16,800
And I think L.A. County is putting in all those rules.

1927
01:51:16,800 --> 01:51:20,960
So I think that's almost goes without saying you're going to have to have that and probably

1928
01:51:21,840 --> 01:51:24,880
I mean, just really depends where we're at come December, I guess.

1929
01:51:24,880 --> 01:51:26,560
But so it's probably going to look like that.

1930
01:51:26,560 --> 01:51:32,000
But other other than the masks and the vaccines, it'll be a relatively normal ceremony.

1931
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:33,200
I'm going to be honest.

1932
01:51:34,160 --> 01:51:35,120
Kind of want to go.

1933
01:51:37,280 --> 01:51:42,400
Kind of want to go like if I could do it like reasonably and get down because the public

1934
01:51:42,400 --> 01:51:43,520
can buy tickets, right?

1935
01:51:43,520 --> 01:51:44,160
Or get tickets.

1936
01:51:45,520 --> 01:51:46,480
I would assume so.

1937
01:51:46,480 --> 01:51:52,240
And the last time we saw that venue in like twenty nineteen show, it was like half empty.

1938
01:51:53,360 --> 01:51:55,520
You could you could see it was like half empty in there.

1939
01:51:57,200 --> 01:52:00,560
I kind of want to go like, am I weird for thinking that?

1940
01:52:01,280 --> 01:52:02,880
Would you guys want to go if you could?

1941
01:52:04,480 --> 01:52:06,320
I would love to get out of the house.

1942
01:52:06,320 --> 01:52:10,400
I'm giving up on going to California Extreme, which is the 16th.

1943
01:52:10,400 --> 01:52:11,680
That's like in a couple of weeks.

1944
01:52:11,680 --> 01:52:12,320
Yeah. Yeah.

1945
01:52:13,120 --> 01:52:14,560
But I mean, I don't know.

1946
01:52:14,560 --> 01:52:16,000
I have to see how everything is.

1947
01:52:17,440 --> 01:52:19,440
Loki, we could do I don't trust other people.

1948
01:52:19,440 --> 01:52:20,320
I'll put it that way.

1949
01:52:20,320 --> 01:52:20,880
I hear you.

1950
01:52:20,880 --> 01:52:21,360
I hear you.

1951
01:52:21,360 --> 01:52:25,440
But, you know, if the if the venue requires precautions, then I feel a lot better about

1952
01:52:25,440 --> 01:52:27,520
it than it's like I do want to go to Twitch Con.

1953
01:52:28,320 --> 01:52:31,760
That's you got so much time for the Twitch comes way out.

1954
01:52:31,760 --> 01:52:36,400
I mean, if we are still dealing with covid in the same manner as we are today, like it

1955
01:52:36,400 --> 01:52:39,520
went, which it's like, oh, with the idiots around us.

1956
01:52:39,520 --> 01:52:40,240
Yeah, I know.

1957
01:52:40,240 --> 01:52:40,880
I know.

1958
01:52:40,880 --> 01:52:41,280
I know.

1959
01:52:42,080 --> 01:52:42,480
All right.

1960
01:52:43,040 --> 01:52:44,640
That would be fun to do that.

1961
01:52:44,640 --> 01:52:46,800
I really need to stream more on Twitch.

1962
01:52:46,800 --> 01:52:50,080
So in order to take advantage of that, but I'd still like to see people there.

1963
01:52:51,760 --> 01:52:52,720
So, yeah.

1964
01:52:52,720 --> 01:52:55,760
And of course, the Game Awards is broadcast everywhere.

1965
01:52:55,760 --> 01:52:58,000
And yeah, they're going to be back in the Microsoft Theater.

1966
01:52:59,200 --> 01:53:03,440
They are saying additional details on health and safety will be in the coming weeks.

1967
01:53:03,440 --> 01:53:08,000
And of course, Jeff Keeley is the show will adhere to the best practices and guidance

1968
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:10,160
from the local health officials, et cetera, et cetera.

1969
01:53:10,160 --> 01:53:12,000
You can bank on because it's in L.A. County.

1970
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:16,000
It's going to be the strictest precautions that the law allows.

1971
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:20,160
That's just that's just how it works with certain parts of California.

1972
01:53:20,160 --> 01:53:27,200
So as 200, Matt says, Rob, if you go, you got to dress up like full gown or sweet.

1973
01:53:28,560 --> 01:53:33,760
Don't tempt me because I'll just look at the types of things that Lil Nas X has been wearing

1974
01:53:33,760 --> 01:53:38,720
to different shows, and he's much better looking guy than me and in much better shape.

1975
01:53:38,720 --> 01:53:41,600
And I think oil and we can wrap you up.

1976
01:53:41,600 --> 01:53:44,880
I think he's inherited the prince fashion mantle.

1977
01:53:45,520 --> 01:53:46,240
Well, yeah.

1978
01:53:46,240 --> 01:53:46,640
Oh, yeah.

1979
01:53:46,640 --> 01:53:47,040
Oh, yeah.

1980
01:53:47,040 --> 01:53:47,840
The the prince.

1981
01:53:47,840 --> 01:53:51,600
Well, and then of course, you also have other folks like, oh, my God, why can't I remember

1982
01:53:51,600 --> 01:53:51,920
his name?

1983
01:53:51,920 --> 01:53:54,880
Billy Porter, you know, has been doing that.

1984
01:53:54,880 --> 01:53:56,080
That man is beautiful.

1985
01:53:56,080 --> 01:53:56,720
Yeah.

1986
01:53:56,720 --> 01:54:00,080
So anyway, and I'm sorry, I did cry at that scene in Pose.

1987
01:54:00,880 --> 01:54:04,960
I have I've only seen the first few episodes of Pose, but I don't watch a lot of TV.

1988
01:54:04,960 --> 01:54:05,520
I sobbed.

1989
01:54:06,560 --> 01:54:08,160
Bobby in chat says, I'd want to go.

1990
01:54:08,160 --> 01:54:11,120
Godfrey from Gamertag Radio is going, oh, that's cool.

1991
01:54:11,200 --> 01:54:12,640
I kind of I really want to go.

1992
01:54:13,760 --> 01:54:17,840
Loki, what if like we drove down that day and I got you back by the next day?

1993
01:54:17,840 --> 01:54:19,920
Like, do you think you could swing it?

1994
01:54:21,360 --> 01:54:22,320
When is it again?

1995
01:54:22,320 --> 01:54:23,200
December 9th.

1996
01:54:23,200 --> 01:54:24,000
It's in the middle of the week.

1997
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:26,320
So we have to take like two days off work, but I could do it.

1998
01:54:27,760 --> 01:54:28,560
Maybe.

1999
01:54:28,560 --> 01:54:28,960
All right.

2000
01:54:29,680 --> 01:54:30,560
I'd love to do it.

2001
01:54:31,920 --> 01:54:33,440
Jamie, of course, you're invited to.

2002
01:54:33,440 --> 01:54:35,760
But I understand your comfort level may be in a different place.

2003
01:54:35,760 --> 01:54:36,560
And that's a OK.

2004
01:54:36,560 --> 01:54:38,560
So if you're what day is that?

2005
01:54:38,560 --> 01:54:39,840
If it's a Saturday?

2006
01:54:40,720 --> 01:54:42,640
It's usually on Thursday, I think.

2007
01:54:42,640 --> 01:54:43,920
I work anyway.

2008
01:54:43,920 --> 01:54:45,360
Yeah, it's in the middle of the week.

2009
01:54:45,360 --> 01:54:49,200
So December 9th is a Thursday.

2010
01:54:50,080 --> 01:54:53,280
I also have another goal for December or January.

2011
01:54:54,800 --> 01:54:56,480
Is that a Twitch related thing or?

2012
01:54:57,040 --> 01:54:58,320
No, I want to go see Tara.

2013
01:54:59,040 --> 01:55:00,080
Oh, that'd be fun.

2014
01:55:00,080 --> 01:55:00,640
Oh, that's right.

2015
01:55:00,640 --> 01:55:03,280
Because they're in Vegas now.

2016
01:55:03,280 --> 01:55:03,600
Yeah.

2017
01:55:03,600 --> 01:55:05,040
Well, back in Vegas.

2018
01:55:05,040 --> 01:55:06,880
I've been for a year, a couple of years.

2019
01:55:06,880 --> 01:55:07,120
Yeah.

2020
01:55:07,120 --> 01:55:08,400
Well, what is time?

2021
01:55:08,400 --> 01:55:12,160
Well, I thought I thought it's been I thought we've had COVID for three Christmases now.

2022
01:55:12,160 --> 01:55:13,360
Apparently, I can't math.

2023
01:55:13,360 --> 01:55:19,680
So I know I, I, I miss my hearts and want to go out and see them.

2024
01:55:20,240 --> 01:55:21,200
Oh, all right.

2025
01:55:21,840 --> 01:55:25,920
Let's move on before you before you head out there at our Sakura.

2026
01:55:26,560 --> 01:55:27,440
Give us our next story.

2027
01:55:30,400 --> 01:55:33,840
The one I accidentally closed because I'm a doof.

2028
01:55:34,480 --> 01:55:35,760
Um, wow.

2029
01:55:35,760 --> 01:55:36,800
Is it even going to load?

2030
01:55:38,640 --> 01:55:42,880
Sorry, my, my stuff decided to take a big shit all of a sudden.

2031
01:55:42,880 --> 01:55:43,200
It's okay.

2032
01:55:43,760 --> 01:55:44,240
There we go.

2033
01:55:45,120 --> 01:55:45,520
Huh?

2034
01:55:45,520 --> 01:55:51,520
I was just at the sidebar says every time I try to open the story.

2035
01:55:53,200 --> 01:55:53,840
There we go.

2036
01:55:54,400 --> 01:55:54,960
All right.

2037
01:55:54,960 --> 01:56:00,000
So, um, Netflix has bought a video game studio.

2038
01:56:00,640 --> 01:56:07,760
They have bought night school studio and, uh, rolled out five mobile, uh, gaming titles

2039
01:56:07,760 --> 01:56:08,960
in the European markets.

2040
01:56:09,760 --> 01:56:18,560
Um, the company, um, sorry, night school studio did Oxenfree, which I mean, that game really,

2041
01:56:18,560 --> 01:56:19,840
really took off very well.

2042
01:56:22,080 --> 01:56:22,480
Yeah.

2043
01:56:22,480 --> 01:56:26,480
So it, if there's a good acquisition, then that would be it.

2044
01:56:26,480 --> 01:56:32,560
So they introduced stranger things, 1984, stranger things, three, the game card blast,

2045
01:56:32,560 --> 01:56:39,280
teeter up and shooting hoops on Android to Netflix subscribers in Spain and Italy.

2046
01:56:40,560 --> 01:56:43,280
And the titles have already been available in Poland.

2047
01:56:43,280 --> 01:56:44,720
So there you go.

2048
01:56:45,520 --> 01:56:48,000
I guess it's something, something.

2049
01:56:50,720 --> 01:56:55,520
Um, it's interesting to see this continue to expand and it's interesting how it's growing

2050
01:56:55,520 --> 01:56:58,640
beyond just the Netflix properties now at this point.

2051
01:56:58,640 --> 01:57:03,120
So we're starting to see more and more with this might look like, and that it, it feels

2052
01:57:03,120 --> 01:57:05,440
like it might be like a separate Netflix thing.

2053
01:57:06,160 --> 01:57:08,480
Like it's not really integrated into the main app.

2054
01:57:08,480 --> 01:57:12,720
I bet on PC, it's going to feel a lot different, but, uh, on the, the mobile device is kind

2055
01:57:12,720 --> 01:57:15,600
of like these two separate sorta sides to it.

2056
01:57:15,600 --> 01:57:19,600
I think this is interesting as it's, it's just continuing to grow, uh, where this might

2057
01:57:19,600 --> 01:57:19,920
end up.

2058
01:57:20,880 --> 01:57:25,680
So, all right, let's move on.

2059
01:57:25,680 --> 01:57:30,400
And, uh, this is, this is something we had kind of joked about before that is now becoming

2060
01:57:30,400 --> 01:57:31,120
a reality, right?

2061
01:57:31,120 --> 01:57:31,440
Loki.

2062
01:57:32,160 --> 01:57:32,480
Yeah.

2063
01:57:32,480 --> 01:57:36,560
So, uh, you know, we're always looking for that Twitch competitor.

2064
01:57:37,520 --> 01:57:38,560
Who's it going to be?

2065
01:57:38,560 --> 01:57:40,320
Who's not Facebook gaming.

2066
01:57:40,320 --> 01:57:44,320
I want to make everybody always jumps in and says, what about Facebook gaming?

2067
01:57:44,320 --> 01:57:46,960
And I said, it has the word Facebook in it.

2068
01:57:46,960 --> 01:57:48,480
Therefore I have no interest in it.

2069
01:57:49,440 --> 01:57:50,000
Yeah.

2070
01:57:50,000 --> 01:58:00,720
So, uh, uh, the site now is, uh, Chatterbait and they're adding support for games in that,

2071
01:58:00,720 --> 01:58:05,600
uh, there is a list of white listed games that are available to play in there.

2072
01:58:06,240 --> 01:58:09,120
Most of them are adult related games.

2073
01:58:09,120 --> 01:58:13,280
Apparently though, like before they used to kind of scold people for doing that.

2074
01:58:13,280 --> 01:58:17,120
Um, but now they do have some of those in there as well.

2075
01:58:17,840 --> 01:58:24,880
Um, and I, ironically though, they also have like other games in there, like logjammers,

2076
01:58:24,880 --> 01:58:28,000
which I guess is like a night or an axe throwing game.

2077
01:58:28,000 --> 01:58:33,600
Um, but yeah, it's, it's mostly just like adult games that are in there.

2078
01:58:33,600 --> 01:58:36,160
I mean, appropriately with the platform, I guess.

2079
01:58:36,160 --> 01:58:40,480
What I want to know about the rules, am I allowed to stream without a shirt on?

2080
01:58:42,400 --> 01:58:43,760
I'm pretty sure that's a yes.

2081
01:58:43,760 --> 01:58:45,840
Cause you know, that's a controversy here on Twitch.

2082
01:58:47,360 --> 01:58:52,960
Although, although, um, they, they did change that rule, uh, some time ago, because I, I know some,

2083
01:58:52,960 --> 01:58:56,400
uh, men here on Twitch who stream without shirts on.

2084
01:58:56,400 --> 01:58:59,920
And there's actually a whole little thing that you put like exclamation shirt.

2085
01:58:59,920 --> 01:59:03,120
Cause people always come in and they're like, you're not supposed to be streaming without a

2086
01:59:03,120 --> 01:59:03,360
shirt.

2087
01:59:03,360 --> 01:59:06,880
It's like that rule changed in 2019 and so forth.

2088
01:59:06,880 --> 01:59:08,480
So it's just, uh, yeah.

2089
01:59:08,480 --> 01:59:12,400
And they've been adding more, uh, games to it and there's been a lot of indie studios

2090
01:59:12,400 --> 01:59:17,840
reaching out to them to, um, add their games or whitelist their games to it.

2091
01:59:17,840 --> 01:59:22,000
So I'm sure that you'll see more of these games on there.

2092
01:59:22,000 --> 01:59:24,880
I mean, there's a lot of them on Steam, so why not?

2093
01:59:25,520 --> 01:59:27,280
If they can stream shirtless, why can't I?

2094
01:59:28,240 --> 01:59:29,440
You could on Chatterbait.

2095
01:59:32,240 --> 01:59:34,560
It just so ridiculous.

2096
01:59:35,840 --> 01:59:36,480
What do you guys say?

2097
01:59:36,480 --> 01:59:41,360
Uh, She-Hulk in chat just says, uh, OLR Chatterbait version 2.0 after dark news.

2098
01:59:41,360 --> 01:59:42,000
What do you guys say?

2099
01:59:42,000 --> 01:59:43,280
You want to move the show to Chatterbait?

2100
01:59:44,560 --> 01:59:47,200
But by the way, do you see where my camera sits?

2101
01:59:48,640 --> 01:59:53,680
No one would see anything anyway, but you can see what I'm wearing right now.

2102
01:59:54,880 --> 01:59:57,280
Oh, it's one of your shirts from your personal store.

2103
01:59:57,840 --> 01:59:58,400
Look at you.

2104
01:59:58,960 --> 02:00:00,160
How'd the quality of that turn out?

2105
02:00:00,160 --> 02:00:00,480
Really?

2106
02:00:00,480 --> 02:00:00,960
I guess good.

2107
02:00:00,960 --> 02:00:01,920
Oh, it's nice.

2108
02:00:01,920 --> 02:00:02,320
It's good.

2109
02:00:02,880 --> 02:00:03,360
It's nice.

2110
02:00:03,360 --> 02:00:06,240
And I just found out I sold another two shirts.

2111
02:00:06,240 --> 02:00:07,120
People like it.

2112
02:00:07,120 --> 02:00:07,840
All right.

2113
02:00:07,840 --> 02:00:08,640
Congrats.

2114
02:00:08,640 --> 02:00:09,120
Congrats on that.

2115
02:00:09,120 --> 02:00:09,280
Yeah.

2116
02:00:10,000 --> 02:00:10,400
All right.

2117
02:00:10,400 --> 02:00:11,600
Well, I'm from my internet.

2118
02:00:11,600 --> 02:00:15,680
I'm sad that we have a little bit of a bummer for this last story tonight, but I do want

2119
02:00:15,680 --> 02:00:17,200
to talk about this and how it does.

2120
02:00:17,200 --> 02:00:19,040
Yes, it does relate to gaming a little bit.

2121
02:00:19,760 --> 02:00:24,720
But, you know, anime fans, uh, were very sad this week to hear about the loss of, uh, and

2122
02:00:24,720 --> 02:00:29,600
I'm sorry if I mispronounced his name, but Takao Saito, uh, who passed away this week

2123
02:00:29,600 --> 02:00:30,400
at 84.

2124
02:00:31,520 --> 02:00:33,200
Uh, oh shit.

2125
02:00:33,200 --> 02:00:33,520
Yeah.

2126
02:00:33,520 --> 02:00:35,760
Uh, he was the creator of Golgo 13.

2127
02:00:36,400 --> 02:00:41,120
Uh, and yeah, nah, he's a big, big, uh, yeah.

2128
02:00:41,360 --> 02:00:43,520
Oh, he did, uh, Baron Air as well.

2129
02:00:44,160 --> 02:00:46,720
He passed due to pancreatic cancer.

2130
02:00:46,720 --> 02:00:48,000
Um, that's always hard to read.

2131
02:00:48,000 --> 02:00:49,040
That's what got granny.

2132
02:00:49,040 --> 02:00:49,760
Yeah, that is.

2133
02:00:49,760 --> 02:00:52,080
And that's, um, and Alex Trebek.

2134
02:00:52,080 --> 02:00:57,440
That's a really, yeah, it's a really, uh, Patrick Swayze, a really nasty, um, cancer

2135
02:00:57,440 --> 02:00:57,760
type.

2136
02:00:57,760 --> 02:00:59,440
It's taken a lot of people from us.

2137
02:00:59,440 --> 02:01:02,240
Uh, so it is a damned hard one to treat.

2138
02:01:02,240 --> 02:01:06,960
Uh, he passed this week at 84th on, uh, I'm sorry, he actually September the 24th.

2139
02:01:06,960 --> 02:01:09,120
So it might've actually been two weeks ago.

2140
02:01:09,120 --> 02:01:13,440
Um, so of course Golgo 13 was, you know, the huge thing that he was known for.

2141
02:01:13,440 --> 02:01:16,720
Uh, and you might be wondering, well, what the hell does that have to do with video games?

2142
02:01:16,720 --> 02:01:20,160
And of course, you know, I'm going to tell you, I'm going to remind you there was a

2143
02:01:20,160 --> 02:01:24,880
Golgo 13 game on the NES and what's interesting about that game.

2144
02:01:24,880 --> 02:01:25,760
I remember them.

2145
02:01:25,760 --> 02:01:27,360
There's some visual novels too.

2146
02:01:27,360 --> 02:01:28,080
Of course, of course.

2147
02:01:28,080 --> 02:01:30,320
I'd be able to walk around backwards in that.

2148
02:01:30,320 --> 02:01:32,160
I remember doing that like moonwalking.

2149
02:01:32,160 --> 02:01:32,880
That was fun.

2150
02:01:32,880 --> 02:01:37,760
I also, in that game, I remember them advertising it in Nintendo power.

2151
02:01:38,320 --> 02:01:42,320
And what was interesting about it was that remember, you know, back in the eighties,

2152
02:01:42,320 --> 02:01:48,960
you know, way back when we weren't quite as aware of the global, uh, pop culture

2153
02:01:48,960 --> 02:01:50,320
market and global things.

2154
02:01:50,320 --> 02:01:56,480
So they marketed Golgo 13 over here without really tying it to the anime.

2155
02:01:56,480 --> 02:02:00,640
Because they assumed most people here wouldn't know of the anime.

2156
02:02:00,640 --> 02:02:03,760
Of course some do, but, you know, especially back in the eighties when there was

2157
02:02:03,760 --> 02:02:05,760
like, well, we didn't get a lot of loop in the third.

2158
02:02:05,760 --> 02:02:06,720
Yeah, exactly.

2159
02:02:06,720 --> 02:02:10,640
We got cliff jumper, which was like a, the castle of Cagliostro.

2160
02:02:11,200 --> 02:02:14,480
So it was just, it was interesting how they had to kind of sell that.

2161
02:02:14,480 --> 02:02:16,480
Uh, and of course they made other games after that too.

2162
02:02:16,480 --> 02:02:19,120
There actually was a DS game in 2009.

2163
02:02:19,120 --> 02:02:22,400
Golgo 13 pursue file G 13.

2164
02:02:22,400 --> 02:02:25,200
But, um, wasn't there a game boy one as well?

2165
02:02:25,200 --> 02:02:32,720
Yeah, there was, um, I, I had read this like not terribly long ago.

2166
02:02:32,720 --> 02:02:38,080
And as I recall, um, for anyone who actually still follows, uh, the manga,

2167
02:02:38,080 --> 02:02:40,080
cause the manga is still in production.

2168
02:02:40,080 --> 02:02:45,520
I think his studio is keeping the story going per her per his wishes.

2169
02:02:45,520 --> 02:02:46,020
Oh, good.

2170
02:02:47,040 --> 02:02:47,540
Yeah.

2171
02:02:48,160 --> 02:02:51,440
Shogakukan, I think it's been a minute.

2172
02:02:51,440 --> 02:02:52,800
I'd have to double check it.

2173
02:02:52,800 --> 02:02:56,160
Dark Tetsuya also points out there's an arcade one with a sniper rifle,

2174
02:02:56,160 --> 02:02:57,920
similar to Konami silent scope.

2175
02:02:57,920 --> 02:03:01,520
So I think you guys series that they should bring back.

2176
02:03:02,400 --> 02:03:04,560
Let's play metal gear for real.

2177
02:03:05,600 --> 02:03:08,960
So I think you guys have the idea that yes, because of its status

2178
02:03:08,960 --> 02:03:14,000
as such a long running, well-known manga in Japan, uh, of course, you know,

2179
02:03:14,000 --> 02:03:17,200
it's bled its way into other pop culture, uh, places.

2180
02:03:17,200 --> 02:03:21,680
So, you know, um, this man's impact, uh, was felt, uh, a lot of places.

2181
02:03:21,680 --> 02:03:24,960
So, uh, you know, we haven't seen a live action series for that,

2182
02:03:24,960 --> 02:03:26,160
or have they done a live act?

2183
02:03:26,160 --> 02:03:29,280
There've been, I think, live, live action Golgo 13.

2184
02:03:29,280 --> 02:03:30,000
I'll double check.

2185
02:03:30,000 --> 02:03:32,320
I'm pretty sure that I've, I've, uh, seen it around.

2186
02:03:33,040 --> 02:03:37,200
Wait, because if that cowboy bebop does well, and it seems like the reception

2187
02:03:37,200 --> 02:03:43,680
to the opening credits and stuff, we're going to go 13 movie came out in 1973.

2188
02:03:44,240 --> 02:03:46,320
But if it does well, does that mean we're going to finally get

2189
02:03:46,320 --> 02:03:48,320
our Leo DiCaprio Akira movie?

2190
02:03:48,320 --> 02:03:52,400
I'm telling you if that cowboy bebop thing on Netflix does well,

2191
02:03:52,400 --> 02:03:55,600
it's going to be the, the, the flood gates will open.

2192
02:03:56,560 --> 02:04:00,480
And by the way, there was a sequel to that live action movie,

2193
02:04:00,480 --> 02:04:03,920
Golgo 13 Assignment Kowloon that starred Sonny Chiba.

2194
02:04:04,800 --> 02:04:05,280
Oh, very cool.

2195
02:04:05,280 --> 02:04:05,440
Yeah.

2196
02:04:05,440 --> 02:04:06,640
That was just brought up in chat too.

2197
02:04:06,640 --> 02:04:07,120
Very cool.

2198
02:04:07,680 --> 02:04:07,920
Yeah.

2199
02:04:07,920 --> 02:04:09,840
I would love to see a live action Trigun.

2200
02:04:10,400 --> 02:04:11,040
That's for sure.

2201
02:04:12,080 --> 02:04:12,400
All right.

2202
02:04:13,520 --> 02:04:16,960
I am going to open up our discord to anybody that wants to call.

2203
02:04:16,960 --> 02:04:18,160
Just join our green room.

2204
02:04:18,160 --> 02:04:20,800
And if you're not on our discord, get, get over there.

2205
02:04:20,800 --> 02:04:24,160
Uh, even if you don't want to call in tonight, uh, join the conversation

2206
02:04:24,240 --> 02:04:27,040
throughout the week over at vognetwork.com slash discord.

2207
02:04:27,040 --> 02:04:28,240
We'll get you on our discord server.

2208
02:04:28,240 --> 02:04:30,800
It's a great way to talk to us throughout the week if you want to.

2209
02:04:30,800 --> 02:04:33,760
Well, at least I don't know how frequently everybody checks in,

2210
02:04:33,760 --> 02:04:35,040
but I'm on it every day.

2211
02:04:35,040 --> 02:04:38,480
So if you want to get ahold of me, uh, you can say hello.

2212
02:04:38,480 --> 02:04:41,680
Um, over in the VOG network, I'm always in discord.

2213
02:04:41,680 --> 02:04:42,240
Awesome.

2214
02:04:42,240 --> 02:04:43,840
Vognetwork.com slash discord.

2215
02:04:43,840 --> 02:04:45,440
If you want to say hello.

2216
02:04:45,440 --> 02:04:49,040
Um, and, uh, we get a lot of story suggestions too, and that's how I

2217
02:04:49,040 --> 02:04:50,640
stay aware of some of the stuff going on.

2218
02:04:51,440 --> 02:04:56,720
I've gotten breaking news from the folks in our VOG network discord.

2219
02:04:56,720 --> 02:05:01,200
Actually, there was something that was posted this week that I saw for the

2220
02:05:01,200 --> 02:05:02,640
first time in that discord.

2221
02:05:02,640 --> 02:05:05,520
And of course, in the moment, I can't remember what it is, but I'm going to

2222
02:05:05,520 --> 02:05:07,680
scroll back through and see if I can find it.

2223
02:05:07,680 --> 02:05:12,960
But of course, once again, invite your calls over at, uh, vognetwork.com

2224
02:05:12,960 --> 02:05:13,760
slash discord.

2225
02:05:13,760 --> 02:05:18,160
If you'd like to give us a call, uh, and in the orange launch radio channel,

2226
02:05:19,120 --> 02:05:22,960
I saw that Konami rumor and the game awards and all that stuff.

2227
02:05:25,040 --> 02:05:26,240
What was it?

2228
02:05:27,200 --> 02:05:31,040
I think it was that Konami, or I'm sorry, the 4k denial thing I'd saw in

2229
02:05:31,040 --> 02:05:34,000
the thing for the first time.

2230
02:05:35,200 --> 02:05:38,800
Oh, there was this interesting thing too, that Bobby had tweeted.

2231
02:05:38,800 --> 02:05:43,200
I had heard about this before, but I thought it was interesting, uh, that

2232
02:05:43,200 --> 02:05:47,120
somebody made a Final Fantasy 14 dancer controller out of a my

2233
02:05:48,000 --> 02:05:49,360
Microsoft connect.

2234
02:05:49,360 --> 02:05:52,240
So you actually have to dance to perform the moves and final.

2235
02:05:52,240 --> 02:05:56,480
It's one of those silly, just because we can things it's like somebody

2236
02:05:56,480 --> 02:06:00,800
beating soul caliber with the dream cast fishing rod, which I know dark

2237
02:06:00,800 --> 02:06:03,360
soccer's referenced on the show before rod caliber.

2238
02:06:03,360 --> 02:06:07,280
That's just somebody do it doing some crazy thing because they can, why not?

2239
02:06:08,160 --> 02:06:13,040
So, um, and Bobby's pointing out the dragon quest, uh, 10 thing most

2240
02:06:13,040 --> 02:06:13,840
recently.

2241
02:06:13,840 --> 02:06:14,000
Yeah.

2242
02:06:14,000 --> 02:06:16,640
I just saw that comment earlier today from 13 X forever.

2243
02:06:16,720 --> 02:06:21,040
Says the dragon quest 10 online that got an offline version some months

2244
02:06:21,040 --> 02:06:21,200
ago.

2245
02:06:21,200 --> 02:06:23,280
And I remember, I remember hearing about that because I want them to

2246
02:06:23,280 --> 02:06:24,400
bring that over here.

2247
02:06:24,400 --> 02:06:27,920
Just quietly got its second expansion as DLC.

2248
02:06:27,920 --> 02:06:31,040
So hopefully we'll get all the expansions for the offline version, which

2249
02:06:31,040 --> 02:06:33,840
brings it closer and closer to a Western localization at some point.

2250
02:06:33,840 --> 02:06:36,640
Hopefully that's what 13 X forever said in our discord.

2251
02:06:36,640 --> 02:06:41,280
Um, and I'd love to, uh, yeah, I really hope that means that they're

2252
02:06:41,280 --> 02:06:43,120
going to localize it for English.

2253
02:06:43,200 --> 02:06:47,440
Cause I'd love to play dragon quest 10 and kind of experience that, um, in

2254
02:06:47,440 --> 02:06:49,920
the offline version, of course, cause I don't think we'll ever get the

2255
02:06:49,920 --> 02:06:50,720
online version.

2256
02:06:51,360 --> 02:06:52,240
That's for sure.

2257
02:06:53,120 --> 02:06:56,640
Uh, anyhow, uh, Oh, we do have somebody in the green room, so let's bring

2258
02:06:56,640 --> 02:06:57,920
them on the air.

2259
02:06:57,920 --> 02:07:02,000
I'm going to, uh, bring them on the air and say hello to them and try to

2260
02:07:02,000 --> 02:07:04,720
get the right camera here on discord.

2261
02:07:04,720 --> 02:07:07,440
But hi, you're on, you are on orange launch radio.

2262
02:07:07,440 --> 02:07:07,920
Who's this?

2263
02:07:08,960 --> 02:07:10,640
Hey, what's going on y'all?

2264
02:07:10,640 --> 02:07:12,080
This is fat Ninja DM.

2265
02:07:12,080 --> 02:07:13,120
It is good to hear from you.

2266
02:07:13,120 --> 02:07:13,920
Fat Ninja DM.

2267
02:07:13,920 --> 02:07:14,400
How are you?

2268
02:07:15,760 --> 02:07:17,040
I am doing awesome.

2269
02:07:17,040 --> 02:07:22,640
I, I probably need my, uh, nerd card revoked cause I did not see the

2270
02:07:22,640 --> 02:07:26,640
passing of the awesome creator of a global 13.

2271
02:07:26,640 --> 02:07:28,080
That is definitely sad.

2272
02:07:28,080 --> 02:07:28,480
You know what?

2273
02:07:28,480 --> 02:07:31,440
There are so many news stories that happen in a week and some of the

2274
02:07:31,440 --> 02:07:33,200
things just slip off the radar.

2275
02:07:33,200 --> 02:07:35,440
That's what podcasts like us are here to do.

2276
02:07:35,440 --> 02:07:39,120
I don't envision that we break the news, but sometimes we pick up the

2277
02:07:39,120 --> 02:07:41,280
news that fell on the floor and slipped through the cracks.

2278
02:07:41,280 --> 02:07:42,960
And, uh, talk about that.

2279
02:07:42,960 --> 02:07:46,320
So unfortunately I wish it was, I wish it was better news.

2280
02:07:46,320 --> 02:07:47,600
Um, but it is what it is.

2281
02:07:48,480 --> 02:07:48,720
Yeah.

2282
02:07:49,520 --> 02:07:53,120
Um, I actually, I just want to talk about real quick about the whole new

2283
02:07:53,120 --> 02:07:53,840
world thing.

2284
02:07:53,840 --> 02:07:57,520
Yes, the cues have been horrendous, but you know, they did add some and

2285
02:07:57,520 --> 02:07:58,400
all that.

2286
02:07:58,400 --> 02:08:04,240
Um, it's one of those things you either really, really enjoy it or you

2287
02:08:04,240 --> 02:08:05,920
just flat out can't stand it.

2288
02:08:05,920 --> 02:08:11,680
And with the, the jankiness of combat right now, it's going to be really,

2289
02:08:11,680 --> 02:08:14,240
really hard for people to latch onto it.

2290
02:08:14,240 --> 02:08:19,520
Now, I'm not saying that it's awful jank, but it's enough jank there that

2291
02:08:19,520 --> 02:08:21,760
will definitely throw some people off.

2292
02:08:21,760 --> 02:08:27,360
But, um, on a scale of one to 10, where one is not that janky and 10 is

2293
02:08:27,360 --> 02:08:28,880
damn it janky.

2294
02:08:28,880 --> 02:08:30,880
Where does, where does this fall?

2295
02:08:32,160 --> 02:08:33,120
Oh man.

2296
02:08:33,120 --> 02:08:36,400
Um, I have to say like a six or a seven.

2297
02:08:36,400 --> 02:08:36,800
Okay.

2298
02:08:36,800 --> 02:08:37,120
Okay.

2299
02:08:37,920 --> 02:08:38,560
Yeah.

2300
02:08:38,560 --> 02:08:41,840
I mean, if you can get over that, it's not a bad game.

2301
02:08:41,840 --> 02:08:47,280
Um, I like the crafting, you know, it's for some reason, uh, y'all talking

2302
02:08:47,280 --> 02:08:50,320
about the power wash simulator a little while ago.

2303
02:08:50,320 --> 02:08:53,760
It's something very satisfying being out in the forest and cutting down

2304
02:08:53,760 --> 02:08:54,640
trees.

2305
02:08:54,640 --> 02:08:58,400
And then I understand that having several other people cutting down

2306
02:08:58,400 --> 02:08:58,720
trees.

2307
02:08:58,720 --> 02:09:02,560
So you see all these trees falling over or a whole bunch of people mining

2308
02:09:02,640 --> 02:09:04,160
some old names or whatever.

2309
02:09:04,160 --> 02:09:08,000
And you hear the pickaxe like tink tink and you hear a whole bunch of them.

2310
02:09:08,000 --> 02:09:08,400
So yeah.

2311
02:09:09,360 --> 02:09:09,600
Yeah.

2312
02:09:09,600 --> 02:09:13,600
You either enjoy it or you'll just flat out like this is garbage and I'm not

2313
02:09:13,600 --> 02:09:14,880
going to play it anymore.

2314
02:09:14,880 --> 02:09:18,400
So, so I assume the way you're talking Fat Ninja, you are playing this game

2315
02:09:18,400 --> 02:09:18,880
right now, right?

2316
02:09:19,680 --> 02:09:20,240
Yes.

2317
02:09:20,240 --> 02:09:22,160
So, um, what is it?

2318
02:09:22,160 --> 02:09:25,200
Do you think that's, you know, cause obviously Dark Sakura, Loki, myself,

2319
02:09:25,200 --> 02:09:26,720
none of us own the game right now.

2320
02:09:26,720 --> 02:09:30,560
We've all kind of watched thanks to Twitch people playing New World, but

2321
02:09:30,560 --> 02:09:33,360
what, what do you think is the reason why?

2322
02:09:33,360 --> 02:09:35,440
I mean, it's breaking steam records.

2323
02:09:35,440 --> 02:09:37,920
It's doing very well for new MMO release.

2324
02:09:37,920 --> 02:09:39,760
What do you think is the reason behind that?

2325
02:09:39,760 --> 02:09:44,080
Is it, is it the, uh, the, the cool crafting system or, you know, especially

2326
02:09:44,080 --> 02:09:46,000
cause you said none of the battle's not that great.

2327
02:09:46,000 --> 02:09:46,640
What do you think it is?

2328
02:09:46,640 --> 02:09:48,720
It's drawing so many people to this game right now.

2329
02:09:49,440 --> 02:09:51,520
It's just a new hotness right now.

2330
02:09:51,520 --> 02:09:57,920
We'll, we'll see within a month or so whether, uh, New World has a staying

2331
02:09:57,920 --> 02:10:03,200
power because yes, um, Amazon is making strides and they're doing things

2332
02:10:03,200 --> 02:10:08,400
pretty quickly to fix things, but as it wears on and then more and more

2333
02:10:08,400 --> 02:10:13,360
people are tired of the long queues and so on and so forth, then we'll

2334
02:10:13,360 --> 02:10:17,840
really actually see, is it the new hotness to say, or is it going to be

2335
02:10:17,840 --> 02:10:19,040
a flash in the pan?

2336
02:10:19,040 --> 02:10:22,000
Like other ones, oh, excuse me.

2337
02:10:23,760 --> 02:10:24,400
Drag them.

2338
02:10:24,640 --> 02:10:31,840
Um, so I think you are very much right on the kind of the new hotness part.

2339
02:10:31,840 --> 02:10:33,360
I think there's a segment of that.

2340
02:10:33,360 --> 02:10:38,880
I think right now, you know, we all know World of Warcraft is not in a good

2341
02:10:38,880 --> 02:10:40,800
spot in many different ways.

2342
02:10:40,800 --> 02:10:43,920
Um, you know, there's everything that's going on with Activision Blizzard.

2343
02:10:43,920 --> 02:10:47,920
There's all the concerns about, you know, um, where the storyline in the

2344
02:10:47,920 --> 02:10:49,360
game is going and so on and so on.

2345
02:10:49,360 --> 02:10:53,200
I'm not really trying to dunk on World of Warcraft, but I think the reality

2346
02:10:53,200 --> 02:10:58,560
is the game is, is hurting more than it's ever hurt in its, you know,

2347
02:10:58,560 --> 02:10:59,600
years long history.

2348
02:11:00,160 --> 02:11:04,480
And, you know, most people have just said, oh, now it's time to play that

2349
02:11:04,480 --> 02:11:06,800
other MMO Final Fantasy 14.

2350
02:11:06,800 --> 02:11:10,480
But I think New World is kind of showing up like those delays in a way,

2351
02:11:10,480 --> 02:11:14,880
I think worked out in its favor because now New World is kind of presenting

2352
02:11:14,880 --> 02:11:19,920
itself as like another option for maybe those that don't think Final Fantasy

2353
02:11:19,920 --> 02:11:23,040
14 is the good fit for them, which is a completely valid thing, right?

2354
02:11:23,280 --> 02:11:26,000
I think you got a lot of like, wow, people that are maybe looking for

2355
02:11:26,000 --> 02:11:29,440
something else in an MMO that maybe like, like some of the crafting and the

2356
02:11:29,440 --> 02:11:30,320
things you talk about.

2357
02:11:30,320 --> 02:11:32,960
I like Final Fantasy 14's crafting system, but it's different.

2358
02:11:32,960 --> 02:11:36,000
So, you know, there's other things maybe the New World's bringing to the table

2359
02:11:36,000 --> 02:11:40,320
that I think they're bringing at just the right time that I think is a huge

2360
02:11:40,320 --> 02:11:41,360
part of this as well.

2361
02:11:41,360 --> 02:11:44,240
And the fact that they are paying Twitch streamers to play it or, you know,

2362
02:11:44,240 --> 02:11:46,080
giving them codes or whatever it is they're doing.

2363
02:11:46,080 --> 02:11:47,200
It certainly helps.

2364
02:11:47,200 --> 02:11:52,160
But I think all of that is just like adding up to like the right stuff that

2365
02:11:52,160 --> 02:11:53,920
makes this game of the moment.

2366
02:11:54,880 --> 02:11:56,320
Oh, yeah, absolutely.

2367
02:11:56,880 --> 02:11:58,000
You know, what's that saying?

2368
02:11:58,000 --> 02:11:59,600
Strike with the iron is hot.

2369
02:11:59,600 --> 02:12:01,120
So that's what they're doing right now.

2370
02:12:01,120 --> 02:12:01,600
Absolutely.

2371
02:12:01,600 --> 02:12:06,720
And by all means, please don't go on a blizzard.

2372
02:12:08,320 --> 02:12:14,640
I think it's one of those things that in the producing or creating of games

2373
02:12:14,640 --> 02:12:19,840
or what have you, you are in this like little bubble of you're constantly

2374
02:12:19,840 --> 02:12:23,760
walking around on eggshells because, you know, people are doing bad things

2375
02:12:23,760 --> 02:12:27,680
and they're constantly walking around these floorboards with all these nails

2376
02:12:27,680 --> 02:12:30,240
and called, you know, countraps sitting all over the floor.

2377
02:12:30,880 --> 02:12:33,920
But, you know, for a while, you know, you're immune.

2378
02:12:33,920 --> 02:12:38,480
You know, you got those thick soled boots or shoes, so you don't, you know,

2379
02:12:38,480 --> 02:12:42,000
skip your feet impaled on those little spikes and stuff.

2380
02:12:42,000 --> 02:12:43,440
But now guess what?

2381
02:12:43,440 --> 02:12:44,640
The shoes and slipped off.

2382
02:12:44,640 --> 02:12:48,000
So now people are stepping all over those spikes and, you know, what's

2383
02:12:48,000 --> 02:12:52,720
making it even, you know, a lot more funny is the simple fact that, you

2384
02:12:52,720 --> 02:12:58,000
know, we have community and, you know, people within these companies sounding

2385
02:12:58,000 --> 02:12:58,400
off.

2386
02:12:58,400 --> 02:13:03,840
And the main person leading the charge is our awesome Dark Sakura, who's

2387
02:13:03,840 --> 02:13:08,000
sitting on the shoulders of these people, putting more weight and driving

2388
02:13:08,000 --> 02:13:10,320
those caltrops and nails in their feet.

2389
02:13:11,200 --> 02:13:15,360
You know, so it's I mean, it's really bad that this has to happen.

2390
02:13:15,440 --> 02:13:18,640
But like you said before, Rob, it just has to happen.

2391
02:13:19,440 --> 02:13:23,600
And, you know, we have to go through that, you know, I guess you could say

2392
02:13:23,600 --> 02:13:26,640
growing pains before things straighten up.

2393
02:13:27,520 --> 02:13:35,120
Yeah, it was a it was something that had to be dealt with because it was

2394
02:13:35,120 --> 02:13:38,080
getting worse and worse and taking over and over.

2395
02:13:38,080 --> 02:13:43,600
It was a it was a virus that was doing horrible things to the gaming industry

2396
02:13:43,600 --> 02:13:45,440
that needs to be addressed.

2397
02:13:45,440 --> 02:13:47,760
Like it's long overdue.

2398
02:13:48,800 --> 02:13:52,000
And hopefully in the case of Blizzard, you know, they have new management

2399
02:13:52,000 --> 02:13:52,320
now.

2400
02:13:52,320 --> 02:13:57,360
The person at the top out, which needed to happen and did happen.

2401
02:13:57,360 --> 02:13:58,880
New people at the top now.

2402
02:13:58,880 --> 02:14:03,520
So it's going to take a little time, but we'll see what effect that they

2403
02:14:03,520 --> 02:14:04,640
have on the culture.

2404
02:14:04,640 --> 02:14:12,320
You know, you have, you know, a woman at the top sharing, you know, so there's

2405
02:14:12,320 --> 02:14:14,480
you know, you could say a lot about that.

2406
02:14:14,480 --> 02:14:17,840
But, you know, the fact that at least there will be some influence there and

2407
02:14:17,840 --> 02:14:23,600
more importantly, in many ways, from a different company, from the outside,

2408
02:14:23,600 --> 02:14:27,920
this Vicarious Visions side that seemed to have been doing a lot of things

2409
02:14:27,920 --> 02:14:28,420
right.

2410
02:14:29,280 --> 02:14:32,400
So it'd be interesting to see what she really brings to the table.

2411
02:14:32,400 --> 02:14:35,680
And then, of course, you know, the other gentleman at the top, Mike Ybarra,

2412
02:14:35,680 --> 02:14:41,280
you've heard a lot with Microsoft and Xbox and has been involved in a lot of

2413
02:14:41,280 --> 02:14:45,920
the right moves that Microsoft's made ever since, you know, Don Mattrick,

2414
02:14:45,920 --> 02:14:49,680
you know, and the clown car that, you know, he was running that flopped the

2415
02:14:49,680 --> 02:14:51,520
Xbox One's initial release.

2416
02:14:51,520 --> 02:14:55,280
So it's going to be interesting to see where Blizzard's at in a year with

2417
02:14:55,280 --> 02:14:55,680
all this.

2418
02:14:56,240 --> 02:14:58,080
Very interested to see what happens.

2419
02:14:58,080 --> 02:15:00,960
But there's a lot of things that need addressing, that's for sure.

2420
02:15:00,960 --> 02:15:03,840
And Diablo 4 cannot flop.

2421
02:15:04,480 --> 02:15:07,520
Diablo, there is so much writing on Diablo 4.

2422
02:15:07,600 --> 02:15:11,680
It cannot flop.

2423
02:15:11,680 --> 02:15:13,520
It cannot afford to flop, period.

2424
02:15:13,520 --> 02:15:14,160
Oh, yeah.

2425
02:15:14,160 --> 02:15:15,200
Yeah, for sure.

2426
02:15:15,200 --> 02:15:18,400
The Barbarians are already at the gate with their pitchforks.

2427
02:15:18,400 --> 02:15:22,080
We're just licking their chops, waiting to attack it.

2428
02:15:22,080 --> 02:15:25,440
And it's not even nowhere near ready yet.

2429
02:15:25,440 --> 02:15:27,840
And barbarian, we mean Bobby Kotek.

2430
02:15:27,840 --> 02:15:28,340
Yes.

2431
02:15:28,800 --> 02:15:29,520
Yes.

2432
02:15:29,520 --> 02:15:30,720
Yes, absolutely.

2433
02:15:30,720 --> 02:15:31,360
Absolutely.

2434
02:15:32,160 --> 02:15:35,840
You know, so before I go, I just, you know, I do send my messages and

2435
02:15:35,840 --> 02:15:38,160
everything, but I just want to just say it on air to all of you.

2436
02:15:38,720 --> 02:15:40,480
I just love what you're doing.

2437
02:15:40,480 --> 02:15:43,040
You know, y'all come from different walks of life.

2438
02:15:43,040 --> 02:15:48,400
You've been through your struggles, your, you know, just awesome triumphs

2439
02:15:48,400 --> 02:15:54,320
in your darkest hour, but y'all still do what you do every single week,

2440
02:15:54,320 --> 02:15:56,320
pretty much weekend and week out.

2441
02:15:56,320 --> 02:16:00,640
And you always make Sundays at this time, something to look forward to.

2442
02:16:00,640 --> 02:16:05,600
And I just really appreciate every last one of you and all your quirks

2443
02:16:05,680 --> 02:16:07,920
and all your triumphs and all your failures.

2444
02:16:07,920 --> 02:16:09,520
I just love all of you.

2445
02:16:09,520 --> 02:16:11,040
You're totally awesome.

2446
02:16:11,040 --> 02:16:16,000
And the community that you have built over these years is totally phenomenal.

2447
02:16:16,000 --> 02:16:20,240
So, you know, claps for everybody, claps for the host and claps for chat.

2448
02:16:20,240 --> 02:16:22,000
Y'all are just totally amazing.

2449
02:16:22,000 --> 02:16:22,800
Thank you so much.

2450
02:16:23,840 --> 02:16:28,320
That means like, that's, that's all we need.

2451
02:16:28,320 --> 02:16:32,960
We, we, it's nice that people give financially and I know you've given

2452
02:16:32,960 --> 02:16:34,880
a lot financially and stuff that, that is nice.

2453
02:16:35,440 --> 02:16:40,480
But what you just gave, that's, that's the feel we really need to get us through

2454
02:16:40,480 --> 02:16:44,720
the next few, you know, years or however long this show keeps going.

2455
02:16:45,520 --> 02:16:46,480
It really means the world.

2456
02:16:47,360 --> 02:16:50,640
I guess, I guess I should say this at some point during the show,

2457
02:16:50,640 --> 02:16:53,040
because something in chat got brought up about this too.

2458
02:16:53,040 --> 02:16:57,760
So Dark Soccer, we probably should let them know about the Guinness World Record thing.

2459
02:16:58,320 --> 02:17:00,320
And yeah, so go ahead.

2460
02:17:00,320 --> 02:17:09,040
They, they denied it because I was submitting it as a single person, which is weird.

2461
02:17:09,920 --> 02:17:10,960
So I have to go back.

2462
02:17:10,960 --> 02:17:13,360
I'm probably going to have to resubmit a different way.

2463
02:17:13,360 --> 02:17:13,860
Yeah.

2464
02:17:14,320 --> 02:17:16,560
But it's just a qualification thing.

2465
02:17:16,560 --> 02:17:20,240
So I'll, I'll just have to figure out the right, the right thing to do it in.

2466
02:17:20,240 --> 02:17:24,320
It was probably one of those things because the record was for Orange Lounge Radio.

2467
02:17:24,320 --> 02:17:25,600
Then they see that as a business.

2468
02:17:25,680 --> 02:17:29,680
And so they probably want the money or whatever, as opposed to, you know, Dark Soccer.

2469
02:17:29,680 --> 02:17:30,800
I know, I know.

2470
02:17:30,800 --> 02:17:33,440
I'm going to actually see if I can put in an appeal.

2471
02:17:33,440 --> 02:17:34,080
All right.

2472
02:17:34,080 --> 02:17:37,120
But anyway, we wanted to just give people the update on that.

2473
02:17:37,120 --> 02:17:39,680
And so I know that is like a bummer type of thing.

2474
02:17:39,680 --> 02:17:41,920
And I see that in chat, but here's the thing.

2475
02:17:42,720 --> 02:17:44,720
I don't need Guinness to acknowledge the show.

2476
02:17:44,720 --> 02:17:46,160
It'll be, it'll be nice if they did.

2477
02:17:48,480 --> 02:17:50,000
But nice for a tagline.

2478
02:17:50,000 --> 02:17:50,640
Yes.

2479
02:17:50,640 --> 02:17:52,400
Yeah, it would be a great selling point, wouldn't it?

2480
02:17:52,400 --> 02:17:53,920
But it'd be nice.

2481
02:17:53,920 --> 02:17:57,360
But what Fat Ninja DM just shared with us.

2482
02:17:58,000 --> 02:17:59,120
That's really the best.

2483
02:17:59,120 --> 02:18:02,960
That's way more, that was more important than a Guinness World Record.

2484
02:18:04,000 --> 02:18:05,760
That is far more important than that.

2485
02:18:05,760 --> 02:18:06,960
So thank you so much.

2486
02:18:06,960 --> 02:18:09,440
And it's only marginally better than actually having a Guinness.

2487
02:18:10,560 --> 02:18:10,880
Kidding.

2488
02:18:10,880 --> 02:18:11,200
Kidding.

2489
02:18:11,200 --> 02:18:11,840
That was great.

2490
02:18:11,840 --> 02:18:14,960
It was really, it was really, no, no, no, no.

2491
02:18:15,920 --> 02:18:17,360
Fat Ninja understands.

2492
02:18:17,360 --> 02:18:18,160
All right.

2493
02:18:18,160 --> 02:18:19,120
Right, right, right.

2494
02:18:19,760 --> 02:18:20,320
All right.

2495
02:18:20,320 --> 02:18:20,800
Okay.

2496
02:18:20,800 --> 02:18:23,280
Which I have one in my fridge, so hey, winner.

2497
02:18:23,280 --> 02:18:23,840
All right.

2498
02:18:24,560 --> 02:18:25,280
Take care of my friend.

2499
02:18:25,280 --> 02:18:26,320
Thank you so much for the call.

2500
02:18:26,320 --> 02:18:26,960
I really appreciate it.

2501
02:18:26,960 --> 02:18:27,760
Thank you.

2502
02:18:27,760 --> 02:18:28,160
All right.

2503
02:18:28,160 --> 02:18:28,480
Okay.

2504
02:18:28,480 --> 02:18:29,200
No problem.

2505
02:18:29,200 --> 02:18:30,000
You take care of my friend.

2506
02:18:30,000 --> 02:18:30,880
Have fun in New World.

2507
02:18:31,680 --> 02:18:32,080
All right.

2508
02:18:32,080 --> 02:18:32,320
Thank you.

2509
02:18:32,320 --> 02:18:32,560
All right.

2510
02:18:32,560 --> 02:18:33,060
Later.

2511
02:18:34,000 --> 02:18:34,720
That was very nice.

2512
02:18:34,720 --> 02:18:36,480
Don't we, don't we appreciate those type of calls?

2513
02:18:36,480 --> 02:18:37,200
Thank you so much.

2514
02:18:37,200 --> 02:18:38,320
Absolutely.

2515
02:18:38,320 --> 02:18:39,040
Yeah.

2516
02:18:39,040 --> 02:18:43,360
Orange right in chat says Orange Launch Radio was already declared best podcast in the galaxy.

2517
02:18:43,360 --> 02:18:44,080
That is true.

2518
02:18:44,080 --> 02:18:45,280
You know, here's the thing.

2519
02:18:46,240 --> 02:18:52,400
All we have to do is set up a front to give out world records and say that we do have the world

2520
02:18:52,400 --> 02:18:52,880
record.

2521
02:18:52,880 --> 02:18:55,680
We just can't say it's a Guinness world record.

2522
02:18:56,800 --> 02:18:57,680
There's a difference.

2523
02:18:58,960 --> 02:19:00,720
And I'm still going to fight him.

2524
02:19:00,720 --> 02:19:02,400
No, you should.

2525
02:19:02,400 --> 02:19:06,960
And if we have to look into paying to be recognized as a group, then let's talk about it.

2526
02:19:06,960 --> 02:19:09,440
If it's not a horrible amount of money.

2527
02:19:09,440 --> 02:19:12,000
The OLR Kickstarter make us famous.

2528
02:19:13,040 --> 02:19:15,840
If depending on what we're just infamous right now.

2529
02:19:15,840 --> 02:19:16,240
You know what?

2530
02:19:16,240 --> 02:19:20,160
Depending on what we're talking about, maybe we can just chip or I can just chip in whatever.

2531
02:19:20,160 --> 02:19:20,720
We'll work it out.

2532
02:19:21,280 --> 02:19:22,640
It really isn't supposed to be that bad.

2533
02:19:23,680 --> 02:19:24,000
All right.

2534
02:19:24,000 --> 02:19:25,200
Anyway, anyway.

2535
02:19:26,160 --> 02:19:26,880
I was going to ask.

2536
02:19:26,880 --> 02:19:28,480
So you'd gone AFK at our soccer.

2537
02:19:28,480 --> 02:19:31,520
But I think I think there's no email, right?

2538
02:19:31,520 --> 02:19:32,880
So I just empty.

2539
02:19:32,880 --> 02:19:33,200
Yeah.

2540
02:19:33,200 --> 02:19:35,600
Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

2541
02:19:35,600 --> 02:19:37,520
If you want to send us an email for a future week.

2542
02:19:37,520 --> 02:19:42,080
Again, that's participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com because we didn't have any emails.

2543
02:19:43,040 --> 02:19:45,520
Let's check for any last minute stories from Loki.

2544
02:19:46,640 --> 02:19:47,440
Not a whole lot.

2545
02:19:47,440 --> 02:19:52,560
It's mainly just there was a story about and it's predictable because they do this for

2546
02:19:52,560 --> 02:20:00,160
everything that Roblox creators were creating knockoffs of the games that were in squid game.

2547
02:20:00,800 --> 02:20:04,320
And so that's been like the new hotness recently on Roblox.

2548
02:20:04,320 --> 02:20:05,920
But they do that with everything.

2549
02:20:05,920 --> 02:20:07,680
They knock off every single thing on there.

2550
02:20:07,680 --> 02:20:09,760
There's no IP that is safe.

2551
02:20:09,760 --> 02:20:10,160
Hold on.

2552
02:20:11,360 --> 02:20:11,840
I need something.

2553
02:20:11,840 --> 02:20:12,240
Okay.

2554
02:20:12,240 --> 02:20:15,360
So we do these silly little intros at the top of each show.

2555
02:20:15,360 --> 02:20:17,120
Those that listen live, you see it.

2556
02:20:18,000 --> 02:20:21,840
You can't do that on television where, you know, such and such will not be seen tonight.

2557
02:20:22,720 --> 02:20:24,320
So Loki did the one tonight.

2558
02:20:24,320 --> 02:20:25,440
Thank you for doing that, Loki.

2559
02:20:25,440 --> 02:20:30,160
And it was a play on squid game where you incorporated the Splatoon characters into it.

2560
02:20:30,160 --> 02:20:34,240
But I've been hearing all about this fucking show and I know

2561
02:20:34,880 --> 02:20:39,920
nothing about it except that it's Korean and on Netflix without spoiling it.

2562
02:20:40,640 --> 02:20:44,480
Because I've heard that you should kind of not know what it's about when you want.

2563
02:20:44,480 --> 02:20:48,560
But so I'm giving you the difficult task without spoiling it.

2564
02:20:48,560 --> 02:20:51,360
What is this show and why is it so popular?

2565
02:20:51,360 --> 02:20:59,200
So the premise is there are these people that have been approached and invited to participate

2566
02:20:59,200 --> 02:21:02,800
in this contest or game, basically.

2567
02:21:02,800 --> 02:21:08,800
And so they get these cards and they meet up at a certain spot and they're basically

2568
02:21:08,800 --> 02:21:14,080
blindfolded and knocked out and brought to this place to play these games.

2569
02:21:14,080 --> 02:21:18,880
And the games basically what happens is there's like, I think, 456 people.

2570
02:21:19,760 --> 02:21:23,520
They have like so much money per person and it's the last one.

2571
02:21:24,320 --> 02:21:26,320
Last one standing gets all of the money.

2572
02:21:26,320 --> 02:21:27,600
It's a lot of money.

2573
02:21:27,600 --> 02:21:32,640
A lot of these people have like lots of debt that they owe to like, you know,

2574
02:21:32,640 --> 02:21:34,800
bad people or something like that.

2575
02:21:34,800 --> 02:21:39,760
And so the premise is, though, what they don't know going into it is that

2576
02:21:40,400 --> 02:21:43,840
if you lose the game, you die, you get killed.

2577
02:21:43,920 --> 02:21:46,000
And so it's battle royale.

2578
02:21:46,000 --> 02:21:48,880
It's sort of battle royale, but it's them do it.

2579
02:21:48,880 --> 02:21:52,000
Like, for example, what was shown in there is the first game.

2580
02:21:52,560 --> 02:21:58,160
They're playing children game like children, a Korean children's school games, I guess.

2581
02:21:58,160 --> 02:22:00,160
So red light, green light, basically.

2582
02:22:00,160 --> 02:22:04,640
But there's this creepy doll head thing or this giant doll that's, you know, doing the

2583
02:22:04,640 --> 02:22:05,600
red light, green light stuff.

2584
02:22:05,600 --> 02:22:07,840
And if they catch you moving, they shoot you.

2585
02:22:08,560 --> 02:22:11,280
So it's very interesting.

2586
02:22:11,280 --> 02:22:13,120
So there's a lot of these different games.

2587
02:22:13,120 --> 02:22:14,560
So it's arcades murder world.

2588
02:22:16,400 --> 02:22:18,480
I don't know, but yeah, it's very good.

2589
02:22:18,480 --> 02:22:20,240
It's an interesting drama.

2590
02:22:20,240 --> 02:22:23,280
And they have like basically certain rules that are followed in there.

2591
02:22:23,280 --> 02:22:27,520
No one reveals who their identities are in.

2592
02:22:27,520 --> 02:22:31,680
It's just kind of all these different characters that they follow through this and like just

2593
02:22:31,680 --> 02:22:33,360
their experiences with that.

2594
02:22:33,360 --> 02:22:34,720
So it's interesting.

2595
02:22:36,720 --> 02:22:37,440
All right.

2596
02:22:37,440 --> 02:22:37,600
Yeah.

2597
02:22:37,600 --> 02:22:39,040
And I see folks in chat.

2598
02:22:39,040 --> 02:22:39,840
They're saying, let's see.

2599
02:22:39,840 --> 02:22:43,120
I think it was Orange Wright said it's battle royale, but Korean.

2600
02:22:43,760 --> 02:22:46,240
Mike Deff says it's battle royale, but they don't kill each other.

2601
02:22:46,240 --> 02:22:47,680
That's not necessarily true.

2602
02:22:47,680 --> 02:22:48,180
But yeah.

2603
02:22:49,520 --> 02:22:51,600
I'm going to go with the Marvel analogy.

2604
02:22:51,600 --> 02:22:52,400
It's murder world.

2605
02:22:53,360 --> 02:22:56,160
I did ask for the simple version, so I'm OK with that.

2606
02:22:56,880 --> 02:22:59,840
Anyway, quickly, I don't know if you want to say anything else on the Roblox thing,

2607
02:22:59,840 --> 02:23:02,800
Loki, but I want to look at some other comments in chat.

2608
02:23:02,800 --> 02:23:07,200
Darth Tetsuya is saying in chat, if you can pick up Cruise and Blast, do it.

2609
02:23:07,200 --> 02:23:08,800
It's super fun for a budget title.

2610
02:23:08,800 --> 02:23:11,040
I played it for two weeks straight, unlocking everything.

2611
02:23:11,040 --> 02:23:13,920
And Orange Wright kind of seconded that comment in our chat.

2612
02:23:14,480 --> 02:23:16,960
Yeah, I keep I keep forgetting that that's out.

2613
02:23:16,960 --> 02:23:18,480
And I do want to pick it up at some point.

2614
02:23:18,480 --> 02:23:19,040
That's for sure.

2615
02:23:19,040 --> 02:23:21,440
Also, Hot Wheels Unleashed is apparently pretty good.

2616
02:23:21,440 --> 02:23:24,560
I haven't gotten that yet, but that's also very good, too.

2617
02:23:25,520 --> 02:23:28,800
SHO 100 Matt is saying we should get a Wikipedia page up again.

2618
02:23:28,800 --> 02:23:32,320
Been a while since there was one after some clown got the OLR one deleted.

2619
02:23:33,600 --> 02:23:37,280
I would love if we had a Wikipedia article again, but of course, it's just going to get

2620
02:23:37,280 --> 02:23:42,560
deleted unless you have to be able to reference external sources to establish the

2621
02:23:42,560 --> 02:23:43,760
notability of the show.

2622
02:23:43,760 --> 02:23:48,320
I think, yeah, I think there are some out there like you got to do like some of the

2623
02:23:49,680 --> 02:23:53,040
well, first, the fact that we won the first podcast award for gaming and that we're still

2624
02:23:53,040 --> 02:23:54,400
going, there's that.

2625
02:23:54,400 --> 02:23:55,760
But what would really help?

2626
02:23:55,760 --> 02:23:57,600
Here's what would really help SHO 100 Matt.

2627
02:23:59,200 --> 02:24:03,040
I don't know how to phrase this without sounding like ego, so I'm just going to say it bluntly.

2628
02:24:03,920 --> 02:24:10,400
We need more coverage in like gaming press, gaming media about the accomplishments that

2629
02:24:10,400 --> 02:24:15,280
we've done as we're getting into our 20th year of doing OLR, because the more write

2630
02:24:15,280 --> 02:24:20,000
ups we can get from those type of external sources, that's how we get a Wikipedia page

2631
02:24:20,000 --> 02:24:22,320
again, because then there'll be external sources to cite.

2632
02:24:22,320 --> 02:24:23,600
Does that make sense?

2633
02:24:23,600 --> 02:24:30,160
It can't just be like, oh, 10 years ago we spilled the beans on Beautiful Katamari, you

2634
02:24:30,160 --> 02:24:33,200
know, and Guitar Hero rocks the 80s or whatever it was.

2635
02:24:33,840 --> 02:24:34,800
We can't like that.

2636
02:24:34,800 --> 02:24:37,200
That's not going to be strong enough to hold a Wikipedia page for us.

2637
02:24:38,560 --> 02:24:45,280
I still kind of think that the fact that we're the longest running show, but unfortunately

2638
02:24:45,280 --> 02:24:48,800
we don't have anything to really back that up like a Guinness World Record or whatever.

2639
02:24:48,800 --> 02:24:53,680
But if we had an article about us that called us the longest running show, then you can

2640
02:24:53,680 --> 02:24:54,720
kind of reference that.

2641
02:24:54,720 --> 02:24:56,560
Do you see where I'm going with that SHO 100 Matt?

2642
02:24:56,560 --> 02:24:59,680
That's and everybody, I don't mean to pick on you, but that's the sort of stuff that

2643
02:24:59,680 --> 02:25:00,400
we kind of need.

2644
02:25:00,400 --> 02:25:03,760
And then a Wikipedia page can happen again because you'll have those sort of sources.

2645
02:25:04,800 --> 02:25:05,040
Yeah.

2646
02:25:05,040 --> 02:25:07,840
And as Bobby Blackwell says, right now, we're not notable enough.

2647
02:25:08,480 --> 02:25:14,880
I think the fact we won the first podcast award and we're still here ought to say something.

2648
02:25:17,440 --> 02:25:21,360
But it doesn't it has to get that's hard to explain to people.

2649
02:25:21,360 --> 02:25:21,840
It's hard.

2650
02:25:21,840 --> 02:25:22,640
Oh, wow.

2651
02:25:22,640 --> 02:25:24,800
2005 podcast award.

2652
02:25:24,800 --> 02:25:25,440
Wow, wow, wow.

2653
02:25:25,440 --> 02:25:28,480
It's on cam right now if you're watching live.

2654
02:25:28,480 --> 02:25:31,280
Well, we know it's and it's if you Google it, you'll find it.

2655
02:25:31,280 --> 02:25:32,000
It's documented.

2656
02:25:32,000 --> 02:25:34,640
I ironically, here's the thing that gets me.

2657
02:25:34,640 --> 02:25:40,240
Ironically, there is a Wikipedia page for the podcast awards and we're listed on there.

2658
02:25:40,240 --> 02:25:45,680
And like every podcast in that matrix that's ever won an award has an article somewhere.

2659
02:25:47,040 --> 02:25:49,520
Except like one or two, and we're one of them.

2660
02:25:49,520 --> 02:25:51,920
So to make us an artist.

2661
02:25:51,920 --> 02:25:52,320
Yeah.

2662
02:25:52,320 --> 02:25:52,960
Anyway.

2663
02:25:52,960 --> 02:25:57,200
But I don't want to turn this into a woe is me segment because, you know, again, we can

2664
02:25:57,200 --> 02:25:58,160
sit here, bitch, wine, moan.

2665
02:25:58,160 --> 02:25:58,640
We don't have this.

2666
02:25:58,640 --> 02:25:59,200
We don't have this.

2667
02:25:59,200 --> 02:25:59,760
We don't have this.

2668
02:25:59,760 --> 02:26:00,720
You know what we do have?

2669
02:26:01,760 --> 02:26:02,960
That last call we just had.

2670
02:26:03,760 --> 02:26:04,320
Yeah.

2671
02:26:04,320 --> 02:26:05,600
And that's great.

2672
02:26:05,600 --> 02:26:07,440
Far more important than a Wikipedia page.

2673
02:26:08,240 --> 02:26:08,960
Heck yeah.

2674
02:26:08,960 --> 02:26:09,460
Heck yeah.

2675
02:26:10,880 --> 02:26:15,040
Anyhow, on that note, I think we will wrap things up unless there's another last minute

2676
02:26:15,040 --> 02:26:16,800
story you're dying to get out, Logie.

2677
02:26:16,800 --> 02:26:22,000
I'm just reporting that remember how they did it like a boy in the blob kind of remaster

2678
02:26:22,000 --> 02:26:23,200
remake or something like that.

2679
02:26:23,200 --> 02:26:24,080
That was on the Wii.

2680
02:26:24,080 --> 02:26:25,200
That's coming to the Switch now.

2681
02:26:25,760 --> 02:26:26,320
That's about it.

2682
02:26:26,320 --> 02:26:26,880
Oh, yeah.

2683
02:26:27,200 --> 02:26:28,160
Oh, interesting.

2684
02:26:29,040 --> 02:26:30,080
Yeah, it looked pretty cool.

2685
02:26:30,080 --> 02:26:32,880
It was like a kind of hand drawn animated stuff.

2686
02:26:32,880 --> 02:26:34,320
So it looked pretty cool.

2687
02:26:36,080 --> 02:26:39,280
It's kind of a random thing to dig out of the archives, but all right, we'll take it.

2688
02:26:39,920 --> 02:26:40,640
That's for sure.

2689
02:26:40,640 --> 02:26:41,140
Yeah.

2690
02:26:41,840 --> 02:26:42,340
All right.

2691
02:26:44,320 --> 02:26:47,200
Let's wrap it up with our final thoughts and good night.

2692
02:26:47,200 --> 02:26:49,760
I know Dark Soccer is one to get to her stream.

2693
02:26:49,760 --> 02:26:54,240
But before I go to Dark Soccer for her final thought, I will say thank you, of course,

2694
02:26:54,240 --> 02:26:58,480
for participating with Orange Lounge Radio this week, whether you did it live here on

2695
02:26:58,480 --> 02:27:02,720
Sunday night over on Twitch at VOG Network, thank you for that, or if it was listening

2696
02:27:02,720 --> 02:27:03,520
on the podcast feed.

2697
02:27:03,520 --> 02:27:06,560
I know some of you do that and then you kind of share your thoughts on Discord throughout

2698
02:27:06,560 --> 02:27:08,320
the week or via Twitter or whatever.

2699
02:27:08,320 --> 02:27:09,600
So thank you for that.

2700
02:27:09,600 --> 02:27:12,400
However you participated with the show, appreciate you.

2701
02:27:12,400 --> 02:27:15,760
And all we ask, tell a friend or two about the show.

2702
02:27:16,400 --> 02:27:18,240
Tip off a few media sites.

2703
02:27:18,240 --> 02:27:22,080
Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice, but we

2704
02:27:22,080 --> 02:27:24,000
need to get the voices here to get them out on air.

2705
02:27:24,960 --> 02:27:29,040
A nice five-star review on iTunes or wherever it is you found this podcast.

2706
02:27:29,040 --> 02:27:31,600
All of that stuff goes an awful long way.

2707
02:27:31,600 --> 02:27:36,000
If you are so inclined and you'd like to show a little love through some merch purchasing,

2708
02:27:36,000 --> 02:27:40,160
then I suggest you visit our shop, vognetwork.com slash shop.

2709
02:27:40,160 --> 02:27:44,640
And you can check out an Orange Lounge Radio t-shirt or a VOG Network t-shirt or a Bobby

2710
02:27:44,640 --> 02:27:46,640
Black Wolf mug, an OLR sticker.

2711
02:27:46,640 --> 02:27:48,560
There's a lot of stuff up there that you can check out.

2712
02:27:48,560 --> 02:27:50,720
That is all at vognetwork.com slash shop.

2713
02:27:51,440 --> 02:27:52,560
But you certainly don't have to.

2714
02:27:53,200 --> 02:27:55,440
Um, that is it for me.

2715
02:27:55,440 --> 02:27:57,520
Let's go around and get final thoughts.

2716
02:27:57,520 --> 02:27:59,120
And Dark Sakura, I will start with you.

2717
02:28:00,640 --> 02:28:03,120
Be kind to yourself and be kind to each other.

2718
02:28:03,120 --> 02:28:04,240
It's easy to be kind.

2719
02:28:05,680 --> 02:28:07,920
Don't be a salty shit in Endgame Chat, yo.

2720
02:28:11,520 --> 02:28:14,960
That's when I just leave and don't give them the satisfaction of a reply.

2721
02:28:15,840 --> 02:28:19,280
I've been actually taking to do the, oh, and one more thing.

2722
02:28:19,280 --> 02:28:21,680
And the Miss Barn approach.

2723
02:28:21,760 --> 02:28:24,160
Oh, oh, I saw somebody else do that.

2724
02:28:24,160 --> 02:28:26,560
I don't know if it was Nick or losing color or somebody.

2725
02:28:26,560 --> 02:28:27,600
I think it was losing color.

2726
02:28:27,600 --> 02:28:28,800
Did the whole like chat.

2727
02:28:28,800 --> 02:28:31,120
Oh, and one more thing and then left the room.

2728
02:28:31,920 --> 02:28:34,080
And then the thing in chat was barned.

2729
02:28:34,080 --> 02:28:35,840
That was so fucking funny.

2730
02:28:37,040 --> 02:28:37,520
That's great.

2731
02:28:37,520 --> 02:28:38,080
Yes.

2732
02:28:38,080 --> 02:28:38,720
And it works.

2733
02:28:39,440 --> 02:28:41,680
You can use that outside dead by daylight.

2734
02:28:41,680 --> 02:28:45,200
Use that in whatever game is having a chat that's pissing you off.

2735
02:28:45,200 --> 02:28:46,080
Just let them know.

2736
02:28:46,080 --> 02:28:46,720
You know what?

2737
02:28:46,720 --> 02:28:48,720
And one more thing and then leave.

2738
02:28:48,720 --> 02:28:51,280
And then if they'll just be waiting for an answer.

2739
02:28:52,400 --> 02:28:53,280
And you own them.

2740
02:28:53,280 --> 02:28:53,680
All right.

2741
02:28:53,680 --> 02:28:56,240
Anyway, thank you to our Sakura and have a good stream tonight.

2742
02:28:56,880 --> 02:28:57,120
All right.

2743
02:28:57,120 --> 02:28:58,080
Thank you.

2744
02:28:58,080 --> 02:28:58,580
All right.

2745
02:28:59,360 --> 02:29:00,960
And then my final thought for the night.

2746
02:29:01,920 --> 02:29:02,240
Let's see.

2747
02:29:02,240 --> 02:29:03,520
I don't know if I have a lot to say.

2748
02:29:03,520 --> 02:29:08,080
I'm just going to, I will reiterate what I said earlier with my well wishes for Bobby

2749
02:29:08,080 --> 02:29:09,840
Blackwolf and we hope to see you back here.

2750
02:29:10,720 --> 02:29:12,880
Sunday nights are going to be very strange without you.

2751
02:29:12,880 --> 02:29:14,400
If it's just one week, then whatever.

2752
02:29:14,400 --> 02:29:15,360
Bobby's on vacation.

2753
02:29:16,240 --> 02:29:19,680
But it's going to be very weird if it goes on for any longer.

2754
02:29:19,760 --> 02:29:27,840
So but obviously everything is that you're doing is more important than the show.

2755
02:29:27,840 --> 02:29:30,400
So I get it.

2756
02:29:30,400 --> 02:29:30,900
All right.

2757
02:29:31,840 --> 02:29:33,680
Last but not least, Loki.

2758
02:29:34,720 --> 02:29:37,440
I'm hoping to have my video out this week.

2759
02:29:37,440 --> 02:29:40,800
I was hoping to have it out last week and that took forever.

2760
02:29:40,800 --> 02:29:47,600
So I'm still fighting, trying to get content to a manageable amount.

2761
02:29:47,600 --> 02:29:49,760
They can film in a week and turn around in a week.

2762
02:29:49,760 --> 02:29:50,400
You can do it.
