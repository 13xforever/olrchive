00:00.000 --> 00:13.880
Sony might be ushering in a new normal of direct sales and delivery with their announcement

00:13.880 --> 00:17.600
that they will be handing out golden tickets to players allowed to purchase a PS5.

00:17.600 --> 00:21.000
The unstated goal of this is to link purchases to unique players and keep machines out of

00:21.000 --> 00:24.180
the hands of scalpers, since supply is chronically short as it is.

00:24.180 --> 00:26.320
But will retailers feel slighted anyway?

00:26.320 --> 00:28.920
Yeah, pretty likely.

00:28.920 --> 00:32.360
This is one story in a varied night, now it's time for your hosts Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers

00:32.360 --> 00:35.320
and Loki to tell you more about this and the rest of the week's gaming news, starting right

00:35.320 --> 00:37.840
now on the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:37.840 --> 00:48.280
Hello my friends, out there on the internet, welcome back to another week of the show where

00:48.280 --> 00:50.400
every gamer has a voice.

00:50.400 --> 00:57.020
It is Orange Lounge Radio and we are back once again with episode number 888 of our

00:57.020 --> 01:01.140
show for tonight, October the 17th of 2021.

01:01.140 --> 01:03.980
My name is Rob Roberts and I'm going to do a rushed intro here.

01:03.980 --> 01:06.780
My co-hosts DarkSakura are Jamie Summers.

01:06.780 --> 01:07.780
Hi.

01:07.780 --> 01:10.420
Hi, and Techmaster Loki.

01:10.420 --> 01:11.420
Hello.

01:11.420 --> 01:14.900
Hello, we're getting a little bit of a late start tonight.

01:14.900 --> 01:18.580
For the folks on the podcast feed, it's a normal week, whatever.

01:18.580 --> 01:22.180
For those that are watching live tonight, we're getting a little bit of a late start.

01:22.180 --> 01:27.780
It's actually closer to 6.35 Pacific time where we're located, 9.35 for those of you

01:27.780 --> 01:30.180
on the East Coast.

01:30.180 --> 01:33.940
We do tape live, of course, every Sunday night at the Voice of Geeks Network, twitch.tv slash

01:33.940 --> 01:36.900
vog network, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

01:36.900 --> 01:39.460
Usually we start about 6 Pacific, 9 Eastern.

01:39.460 --> 01:45.100
But what happened is right about 5.45 our time, I got hit with a power outage here at

01:45.100 --> 01:50.600
OLR headquarters where we used to gather in person before the pandemic and all that stuff.

01:50.600 --> 01:54.860
And obviously since the broadcasting stuff is here, if there's no power, we can't do

01:54.860 --> 01:55.860
a show.

01:55.860 --> 01:59.320
So I hastily tried to text Bobby and let him know what was going on.

01:59.320 --> 02:04.480
Usually I would try to watch, but the cell tower I think got taken out too because my

02:04.480 --> 02:06.760
signal was terrible.

02:06.760 --> 02:10.520
So that part was really unfortunate, but we got through it.

02:10.520 --> 02:11.520
We're here now.

02:11.520 --> 02:12.520
We're just a little delayed.

02:12.520 --> 02:18.140
So thank you very much to our pal Bobby Black Wolf who was coming back from being gone due

02:18.140 --> 02:21.940
to a medical thing for the past couple of weeks and ended up doing a jumbo show tonight.

02:21.940 --> 02:24.900
So thank you Bobby for vamping a little bit for us.

02:24.900 --> 02:27.820
And I'm glad we all could be here and actually do a show.

02:27.820 --> 02:29.420
And hi to everybody in chat.

02:29.420 --> 02:32.060
Shehulk10 in chat says, better late than never.

02:32.060 --> 02:33.820
Yes, I suppose that is the case.

02:33.820 --> 02:36.500
Or as the Golden Girls say, better late than pregnant.

02:36.500 --> 02:37.740
So there you go.

02:37.740 --> 02:44.500
Anyhow, also, I also noticed just now in our chat live, they just hit that goal for Orange

02:44.500 --> 02:45.740
Lounge Foodio.

02:45.740 --> 02:47.060
So guess what, guys?

02:47.060 --> 02:52.340
We get to do a special episode all about food and we'll do that in the coming weeks.

02:52.340 --> 02:55.500
You guys hit that a lot sooner than we expected it to happen.

02:55.500 --> 02:59.580
So that show is actually probably going to happen in early mid-November just because

02:59.580 --> 03:03.180
there's a lot of stuff going on and we're not going to be here.

03:03.180 --> 03:05.260
We're definitely not going to be here next week.

03:05.260 --> 03:08.980
I am not going to be here because I am going to LA.

03:08.980 --> 03:10.860
Dark Soccer is also going out of town.

03:10.860 --> 03:12.780
And I can talk about it.

03:12.780 --> 03:13.780
Okay.

03:14.500 --> 03:18.140
I don't want to put you on the spot, but if you're volunteering, please talk about it.

03:18.140 --> 03:25.840
So last week, I'm sure a lot of you know that I was talking about doing a marathon to raise

03:25.840 --> 03:28.620
money for my friend Barbara's GoFundMe.

03:28.620 --> 03:32.940
She'd just been diagnosed with cancer, just started chemotherapy.

03:32.940 --> 03:45.860
And partway through the marathon, which was on Monday, I did get a message from her wife,

03:45.860 --> 03:51.180
her partner, that she died.

03:51.180 --> 03:59.980
She was going into the hospital for sepsis as a reaction to the chemotherapy.

04:00.020 --> 04:13.780
It had to do with the immunosuppressants, but she died.

04:13.780 --> 04:16.420
And I was like, well, do you need me to call?

04:16.420 --> 04:18.220
Do you need me to do anything?

04:18.220 --> 04:20.300
I'd like to be there for you.

04:20.300 --> 04:21.900
And she's like, nope, keep doing the marathon.

04:21.900 --> 04:27.460
We now need the money to pay for the funeral.

04:27.460 --> 04:37.180
And I'm just, I'm floored about it.

04:37.180 --> 04:46.180
And so Tiara and I, which I'm sure some of our long-term listeners here know Tiara, and

04:46.180 --> 04:50.180
Maggie actually did sing something that we played on the show.

04:50.180 --> 04:55.740
She did a cover of Bang Bang.

04:55.740 --> 04:57.540
People more know it maybe from Kill Bill.

04:57.540 --> 05:01.620
Yeah, that's like the early OLR years, yeah, yeah.

05:01.620 --> 05:02.620
Yeah.

05:02.620 --> 05:06.580
So we're going out to see her and to be there for the memorial.

05:06.580 --> 05:15.700
We're both doing a Thursday night red-eye and hoping to make a memorial on time.

05:15.700 --> 05:19.740
But I'm super depressed.

05:19.780 --> 05:27.460
Barbara was my papa's son and Maggie is my mama's son, and they both mean the universe

05:27.460 --> 05:32.580
to me and Barbara went really, really fast.

05:32.580 --> 05:38.540
And I suppose there's the part of me that's trying to be all logical and say it was better

05:38.540 --> 05:41.420
fast than long and drawn out and painful.

05:41.420 --> 05:48.780
And at the same time, Barbara was a fighter and I expected, I don't know what I expected

05:48.780 --> 05:53.180
really because life is completely stupid.

05:53.180 --> 05:54.620
It just happens.

05:54.620 --> 05:56.940
It happens when you don't expect it.

05:56.940 --> 06:06.100
And which just makes me all the more want to tell our listeners, my friends, everybody,

06:06.100 --> 06:13.380
how much I love all of you and that the world is a great place to have you in it.

06:13.380 --> 06:19.100
And well, yeah, fuck cancer.

06:19.100 --> 06:20.100
Fuck it.

06:20.100 --> 06:22.860
It's terrible.

06:22.860 --> 06:27.620
And I logically know there will never be a cure for it because cancer in and of itself

06:27.620 --> 06:31.140
is a series of mutations.

06:31.140 --> 06:42.220
That's not going to happen, but I would encourage everybody if you can find

06:42.220 --> 06:49.820
a reputable charity that's doing actual cancer research and not just merchandising stuff,

06:49.820 --> 06:51.460
donate.

06:51.460 --> 06:59.420
And I didn't want to use the show for this, but if you can spare something for my friend's

06:59.420 --> 07:06.420
funeral expenses, talk to me offline and I'll let you know.

07:06.420 --> 07:07.420
And it's fine.

07:07.420 --> 07:11.340
I don't think anyone cares that you're using the show for that because anyone that's talked

07:11.340 --> 07:18.500
to you for a reasonable length of time, especially right after you moved here from Alabama knows

07:18.500 --> 07:21.060
how important these folks were to you.

07:21.060 --> 07:26.480
So I'm truly sorry that this happened.

07:26.480 --> 07:31.060
And yeah, it certainly puts a lot in perspective of a silly power outage delaying our show,

07:31.060 --> 07:35.260
but there's much bigger things and you're right.

07:35.260 --> 07:38.460
When something like this happens, it happens.

07:38.460 --> 07:42.020
And there's just not a lot we can do sometimes.

07:42.020 --> 07:46.300
So thank you.

07:46.300 --> 07:51.580
Thank you for sharing the story with us and the marathon, at least when I was finally

07:51.580 --> 07:52.580
able to see it.

07:52.580 --> 07:58.960
So I guess trying to go back to less difficult topics that the power outage thing tonight

07:58.960 --> 08:04.520
was especially frustrating because Monday when you were doing your marathon, we had

08:04.520 --> 08:06.180
a power outage here again.

08:06.180 --> 08:09.580
And I don't know why all of a sudden there's all these power outages.

08:09.580 --> 08:12.700
Somebody on Twitter had asked me, oh, is it because California, it has nothing to do with

08:12.700 --> 08:15.060
what you're hearing in the media about wildfires and all that stuff.

08:15.060 --> 08:18.740
That's another company, PG&E, that doesn't service where we are in Sacramento.

08:18.740 --> 08:23.180
Sacramento has their own utility and it's nothing to do with any of that.

08:23.180 --> 08:27.420
I really don't know why all of a sudden power outages are a problem this week.

08:27.420 --> 08:36.080
I think it is weather related because Monday we did have a really bad windstorm and now

08:36.080 --> 08:40.240
it's windy outside again tonight and rain is supposed to come in.

08:40.240 --> 08:47.840
So I think it's just because the last nine months, 10 months have been so dry, it's causing

08:47.840 --> 08:50.060
the windstorm to knock more stuff over.

08:50.060 --> 08:53.120
And I think, you know, you just you had to happen in one area on Monday and you had to

08:53.120 --> 08:55.320
happen here tonight.

08:55.320 --> 08:59.920
But when I was trying to participate in Dark Soccer Marathon, we lost power for it was

08:59.920 --> 09:01.840
from noon until 1030.

09:01.840 --> 09:03.800
So we were out of power for 10 hours.

09:03.800 --> 09:08.880
So that means our food in the fridge after we had just gone to Costco had to replace

09:08.880 --> 09:09.880
it.

09:09.880 --> 09:11.440
That's not irritating or anything.

09:11.440 --> 09:17.160
And yes, I know there's ways to get insurance and stuff, but it's still the process is still

09:17.160 --> 09:18.160
a pain in the ass.

09:18.160 --> 09:19.160
You know what I mean?

09:19.160 --> 09:20.160
Yeah.

09:20.160 --> 09:21.720
Well, it's life in a hurricane.

09:21.720 --> 09:22.720
Yeah.

09:22.720 --> 09:23.720
Right.

09:23.720 --> 09:24.720
Right.

09:24.720 --> 09:25.720
But seriously, no.

09:25.720 --> 09:30.600
We would keep multiple coolers on hand and buy all the ice just for stuff like that.

09:30.600 --> 09:35.640
But I remind people of this a lot, you know, especially, you know, because I hear it a

09:35.640 --> 09:39.000
lot when it does rain here in California.

09:39.000 --> 09:41.440
Everybody from back east will say that's not a rainstorm.

09:41.440 --> 09:42.440
That's nothing.

09:42.440 --> 09:43.440
You don't know what real rain is.

09:43.440 --> 09:44.440
Well, I know.

09:44.440 --> 09:45.440
I know.

09:45.440 --> 09:49.840
But the problem is, is that it's not it's not built out here for that.

09:49.840 --> 09:53.800
And that's that's what it is, because the weather is a certain way out here that places

09:53.800 --> 09:54.800
not built that way.

09:54.800 --> 10:00.480
It's the same reason you don't see brick homes here, because earthquakes can happen in California.

10:00.560 --> 10:04.160
So we don't have brick homes like like it's just things are built a certain way because

10:04.160 --> 10:06.680
of whatever natural disasters are tending to occur.

10:06.680 --> 10:11.600
So we're not set up for these hurricanes and multiple power outages.

10:11.600 --> 10:14.360
You know about the story of Disney World, right?

10:14.360 --> 10:15.360
Which one?

10:15.360 --> 10:20.840
They tried to build they tried to build Disney World like Disneyland.

10:20.840 --> 10:24.840
And it mildewed and started falling apart because of the humidity.

10:24.840 --> 10:26.400
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

10:26.400 --> 10:30.440
So when I moved out here and I saw how things were constructed, I'm like, excuse me.

10:30.600 --> 10:31.600
What?

10:31.600 --> 10:32.600
No.

10:32.600 --> 10:35.480
Weather's going to sneeze and this will all fall over.

10:35.480 --> 10:40.480
And then like, I wouldn't go out on a wooden balcony for like three years after I moved

10:40.480 --> 10:41.480
out here.

10:41.480 --> 10:42.480
Sure, sure.

10:42.480 --> 10:43.480
But now.

10:43.480 --> 10:44.480
Yeah.

10:44.480 --> 10:47.160
But now it's like, well, that's just it works here.

10:47.160 --> 10:48.160
It's fine.

10:48.160 --> 10:52.880
We don't until, you know, the last 10 years or so as climate change has been having its

10:52.880 --> 10:53.880
impact.

10:53.880 --> 10:55.440
Those sorts of things are whatever.

10:55.440 --> 10:58.520
But anyway, we could go down a very big rabbit hole there.

10:58.520 --> 11:00.160
We're already getting a late start tonight.

11:00.160 --> 11:04.480
So I suppose we should shift the topic to something that often takes our minds off of

11:04.480 --> 11:08.100
things and the other bad things going on in the world.

11:08.100 --> 11:09.300
And that is video games.

11:09.300 --> 11:15.560
So let's get into our kickoff topic tonight, which has to do with perhaps the future of

11:15.560 --> 11:19.480
games of some sort or what some people want those to be anyway.

11:19.480 --> 11:25.340
Loki, can you can you start us off with tonight's story about what Steam is going to be blocking

11:25.340 --> 11:28.140
from their marketplace pretty soon?

11:28.140 --> 11:30.500
I guess as they have already, I guess.

11:30.500 --> 11:32.100
Yeah, they've already done it.

11:32.100 --> 11:40.880
So they had blocked a few games that had NFTs or offered crypto in them.

11:40.880 --> 11:44.780
And the reason that they did this and it makes sense when you think about it is they've gotten

11:44.780 --> 11:50.940
in trouble before with offering items in game and having kind of an auction house where

11:50.940 --> 11:56.620
you could potentially sell those in game items for real world cash.

11:56.620 --> 12:01.180
And so since they've gotten in trouble, I believe in like the European unions and stuff

12:01.180 --> 12:09.100
like that with that, they have been basically knocking down anything that could be potentially

12:09.100 --> 12:15.140
used to give you something of value from, you know, unlocks and games and stuff like

12:15.140 --> 12:16.140
that.

12:16.140 --> 12:19.340
So NFTs, of course, because you could trade them for money.

12:19.340 --> 12:24.540
And Bitcoin, well, I mean, that's self-explanatory, you can also trade that for money.

12:24.540 --> 12:29.900
And so they have gone ahead and removed the games that had that in there.

12:29.900 --> 12:37.260
Like for example, Light Night and Age of Rust was a game that they had NFTs where you could

12:37.260 --> 12:44.380
actually kind of buy the NFT and use it to unlock stuff in game or something like that.

12:44.380 --> 12:45.380
And then there was another game.

12:45.380 --> 12:46.380
I don't remember which one it was.

12:46.380 --> 12:51.580
It was like a puzzle game where you got Bitcoin if you play the puzzle or something like that.

12:51.580 --> 12:55.420
So yeah, look, it makes sense.

12:55.420 --> 13:01.220
Look, I and when we're talking about Bitcoin or whatever, like I and I'm not I'm not going

13:01.220 --> 13:02.500
to dog on it or whatever.

13:02.500 --> 13:05.740
I understand people have their environmental concerns, etc.

13:05.740 --> 13:11.180
But I from the perspective of trying to critique what's going on here, I'm putting Bitcoin

13:11.180 --> 13:17.180
on the same level as dollars, pesos, yen, whatever currency, it has some sort of value

13:17.180 --> 13:21.520
in the monetary universe, whether it does to you specifically or not, it does have value

13:21.520 --> 13:22.520
in the universe.

13:22.520 --> 13:24.180
I mean, PayPal has Bitcoin now.

13:24.180 --> 13:26.960
So it's it's something you can get value out of.

13:26.960 --> 13:27.960
Right.

13:27.960 --> 13:32.160
But but entities are kind of a gray area as well, because there's been so many scams recently

13:32.160 --> 13:38.480
with those and like necessarily Bitcoin, but like other crypto currencies, there's been

13:38.480 --> 13:39.480
right.

13:39.480 --> 13:40.900
So many pump and dump schemes.

13:40.900 --> 13:41.900
And here's the thing.

13:41.900 --> 13:47.240
Like, as far as like the real world currency and games, Diablo three should and what it

13:47.240 --> 13:51.560
originally was and why it had so many issues in the beginning with the real money access.

13:51.560 --> 13:57.160
That should be informing everybody that gaming is not the place for this.

13:57.160 --> 14:00.640
And like everybody wants to put a get rich, quick scheme in gaming.

14:00.640 --> 14:03.160
Diablo three showed ain't going to happen.

14:03.160 --> 14:05.720
And like, I know people think, oh, this is different.

14:05.720 --> 14:06.720
This is different.

14:06.720 --> 14:07.720
No, no, no.

14:07.720 --> 14:12.360
The problem is you're always going to have way too much supply and not enough demand,

14:12.360 --> 14:13.640
period.

14:13.640 --> 14:18.000
Because what's going to happen is that if it turns out you can earn even the slightest

14:18.000 --> 14:24.880
amount of Bitcoin, you're going to have other places throughout the world that have very

14:24.880 --> 14:30.160
questionable labor practices that are going to force people to play these games over and

14:30.160 --> 14:34.480
over and over again to get these items to sell to those few people that are going to

14:34.480 --> 14:35.600
buy them.

14:35.600 --> 14:39.960
And I don't think that they're giving away Bitcoin in that sense, where it's like an

14:39.960 --> 14:40.960
unlimited supply.

14:40.960 --> 14:45.560
I think it's more of like kind of an incentive, like a contest, even the auction house, even

14:45.560 --> 14:46.560
the contest.

14:46.560 --> 14:48.880
They'll dump as many entries in the contest as they can.

14:48.880 --> 14:52.320
Even the auction house, they'll spam as much in that auction house as they can for those

14:52.320 --> 14:53.800
few people that can buy.

14:53.800 --> 14:56.320
Nobody ever made money off that auction house.

14:56.320 --> 14:58.200
It was.

14:58.200 --> 14:59.200
That's why it went away.

14:59.200 --> 15:00.440
It was money after that.

15:00.440 --> 15:01.560
I made a quarter.

15:01.560 --> 15:02.640
I made a quarter.

15:02.640 --> 15:05.680
And I don't even know how I did that, to be quite honest.

15:05.680 --> 15:09.280
More on steam than anything selling trading cards.

15:09.280 --> 15:14.600
And now, as far as the NFT thing goes, I'm still trying to write like I get Bitcoin,

15:14.600 --> 15:19.120
I get question mark Bitcoin, I get Ethereum and all this other knockoff.

15:19.120 --> 15:24.400
I shouldn't call them knockoffs, but I'm sorry to me, they just get all the same to me.

15:24.400 --> 15:26.720
So I get that.

15:26.720 --> 15:30.240
I'm still trying to wrap my head around what NFT like really is like.

15:30.240 --> 15:33.960
I guess it's like a digital type, like it's like an ownership token of some sort.

15:33.960 --> 15:39.240
Yeah, it's a digital good that you have ownership that you can basically it's like your certificate

15:39.240 --> 15:40.240
of authentication.

15:40.240 --> 15:41.240
OK, everything.

15:41.240 --> 15:44.200
So so here's I do think I actually get that.

15:44.200 --> 15:45.880
And here's the wild thing.

15:45.880 --> 15:47.560
This comes in the same week.

15:47.560 --> 15:50.600
And I'm going to go down a dead by daylight rabbit hole.

15:50.600 --> 15:54.140
But it absolutely relates to this whole story.

15:54.140 --> 15:56.240
And Dark Soccer, you're going to know this one, too.

15:56.240 --> 16:00.480
It has to do with the pinhead voice lines that were going to be in the game.

16:00.480 --> 16:03.640
You open the box and I came and I came.

16:03.640 --> 16:08.880
Did you hear the story about why those got removed and what apparently that's all about?

16:09.200 --> 16:14.560
A bit of it, yeah, that there was something like they wanted to bring it back in via NFT.

16:14.560 --> 16:21.600
Yes, the license holders to that whole thing wanted to create like a Hellraiser pinhead

16:21.600 --> 16:27.400
NFT that would get you access to pinhead in all these other things.

16:27.400 --> 16:30.200
It would be like a pinhead unlock in all these other things.

16:30.200 --> 16:35.580
And it would allow the voice dialog to be there in dead by daylight and I guess other

16:35.580 --> 16:38.280
types of interactions and other games.

16:38.880 --> 16:41.760
I'm not sure fucking pinhead is worth that.

16:41.760 --> 16:46.480
I think Waluigi could get that judging off the past two weeks on the Internet.

16:46.480 --> 16:48.520
But I don't think it had to be late.

16:48.520 --> 16:48.920
Sorry.

16:48.920 --> 16:53.840
Flea says that DBD released a statement that the NFT story was a fake.

16:53.840 --> 16:54.360
Thank you.

16:54.360 --> 16:55.280
Thank you, Flea.

16:55.280 --> 17:00.760
OK, I apologize for being the Fox News video game podcast right here, but it is what it is.

17:00.760 --> 17:02.760
That story was going around.

17:02.760 --> 17:08.080
However, OK, so thank you, Flea, for debunking the story, because that whole thing was ridiculous anyway.

17:08.080 --> 17:17.480
But I still say that is still something people are looking for in gaming, even if it's not

17:17.480 --> 17:24.080
true in that case, some crypto and again, I'm going to get here's the thing.

17:24.080 --> 17:28.880
If you're going to email me explaining to me why I'm wrong, you better do it like I'm

17:28.880 --> 17:31.040
a five year old when it comes to this stuff.

17:31.040 --> 17:35.400
And you need to understand part of the reason why NFTs are not like the big thing right

17:35.400 --> 17:37.720
now is because most people don't fucking understand them.

17:37.720 --> 17:40.160
So if you're going to email me and yell at me why I'm wrong, you're going to need to

17:40.160 --> 17:42.600
explain like I'm five.

17:42.600 --> 17:43.600
Why I'm wrong.

17:43.600 --> 17:50.200
OK, here's the whole thing is that I think some people want that to kind of be gaming,

17:50.200 --> 17:52.560
like you buy these like unlock keys and stuff.

17:52.560 --> 17:55.280
I'm not sure the consumer really wants that.

17:55.280 --> 17:56.920
I'm really not.

17:56.920 --> 18:01.120
Mirror Muse in chat says NFT and crypto sound like Beanie Babies at best and pyramid schemes

18:01.120 --> 18:02.600
at worst to me.

18:02.600 --> 18:08.040
Let's see, Zen Monkey 11 says, I wish they had a pinhead Pez dispenser.

18:08.040 --> 18:10.400
And oh, I didn't even realize they tweeted this.

18:10.400 --> 18:15.680
So Mike Deff sent us a tweet from behavior that actually says there's been some talk

18:15.680 --> 18:17.120
about NFTs.

18:17.120 --> 18:20.660
When we work with our licensing partners, we provide them with in-game models as well

18:20.660 --> 18:21.920
as chapter keys.

18:21.920 --> 18:22.920
They are free to use these.

18:22.920 --> 18:27.920
However, they say they see fit as the rightful owners of these characters.

18:27.920 --> 18:32.000
To be very clear, there is no exclusive in-game content linked to these models when they are

18:32.000 --> 18:34.280
distributed outside of the game in any way.

18:34.280 --> 18:35.360
Oh, interesting.

18:35.360 --> 18:36.360
So on.

18:36.360 --> 18:43.160
Well, I got to say the way that reads to me is that maybe they were trying to like that

18:43.160 --> 18:50.920
the Hellraiser folks are trying to bundle these DLC into key is keys and stuff, but

18:50.920 --> 18:53.480
had nothing to do with the voice line dialog and why it was omitted.

18:53.480 --> 18:55.160
So rabbit hole done.

18:55.160 --> 18:59.280
I don't need to dwell on that too much, but I thought that was interesting.

18:59.280 --> 19:00.280
That's for sure.

19:00.280 --> 19:01.280
So.

19:01.280 --> 19:05.360
Anyway, Loki, I know there's another half to the story.

19:05.360 --> 19:06.360
Sorry.

19:06.360 --> 19:07.360
Yes.

19:07.360 --> 19:12.240
And so, of course, you know, Epic Games seizing the opportunity says, hey, guess what?

19:12.240 --> 19:15.960
We're going to welcome NFT games since Steam banned them.

19:15.960 --> 19:16.960
Cool.

19:16.960 --> 19:21.320
You could get in trouble with the same entities that got in trouble or got Steam in trouble.

19:21.320 --> 19:23.320
Or I should say maybe.

19:23.320 --> 19:25.720
I don't know.

19:25.720 --> 19:26.720
Good.

19:26.720 --> 19:28.640
Glad there's a marketplace for them.

19:28.640 --> 19:34.760
Didn't really need to step in and do that, but way to go, Tim Sweeney.

19:34.760 --> 19:38.240
I don't know whether to read this into like Tim Sweeney's trying to be an edgelord, which

19:38.240 --> 19:39.480
is usually the case.

19:39.480 --> 19:45.520
Or this is just, OK, him acknowledging sometimes these purposes can be legitimate and we're

19:45.520 --> 19:47.800
willing to be the playground for this.

19:47.800 --> 19:51.760
It reads to me as him being very try hard to separate himself from Steam.

19:51.760 --> 19:55.240
However, here's the thing.

19:55.240 --> 20:00.640
If a game company wants to try the Diablo three auction house again, go for it.

20:00.640 --> 20:03.520
You're going to flop, but go for it like you.

20:03.520 --> 20:06.720
You can have the ability to do that, I guess.

20:06.720 --> 20:12.240
But yeah, I mean, if you can't learn from history, I OK.

20:12.240 --> 20:15.160
And it's fine, like I just I don't know it.

20:15.160 --> 20:21.500
Whatever, like, I'm not going to be like, oh, my God, I have no strong opinion on any

20:21.500 --> 20:24.960
of this, so it's like, cool.

20:24.960 --> 20:25.880
Good job.

20:25.880 --> 20:26.880
Pat yourself on the back.

20:26.880 --> 20:31.480
Like, I'm not going to use one storefront over the other because of this or that.

20:31.480 --> 20:32.480
I mean, it's just.

20:32.480 --> 20:38.600
Tim Sweeney, can we please like get some actual features like, you know, a shopping cart in

20:38.600 --> 20:42.720
the store, please, instead of just, you know, supporting these games, can we can we can

20:42.720 --> 20:45.280
you finish your storefront, please?

20:45.280 --> 20:49.720
I would appreciate that first before, you know, making these grandos gestures saying

20:49.720 --> 20:53.080
that we're going to accept these types of games and not these other types of games and

20:53.080 --> 20:54.440
whatnot.

20:54.440 --> 20:58.600
Because let's be honest, at the end of the day, yeah, you can get the NFT games over

20:58.600 --> 20:59.600
on Epic Games.

20:59.600 --> 21:07.240
You can get all the pornography games on Steam, so I don't know.

21:07.240 --> 21:12.680
I know I know where my loyalty lies, E3VL in chat says I got one hundred and fifty dollars

21:12.680 --> 21:16.160
in the auction house and I was about to scream and ask questions, how, why?

21:16.160 --> 21:20.160
But then E3VL follows that up saying not worth the time investment, though.

21:20.160 --> 21:21.700
Good lucky drops.

21:21.740 --> 21:25.540
So it it took a lot of work and a lot of luck to make the hundred and fifty bucks.

21:25.540 --> 21:32.460
And I I honestly bet if you'd spent that time, I don't know, driving for Lyft or DoorDash

21:32.460 --> 21:36.300
or doing freelancing types of work that you probably could have gotten that type of money

21:36.300 --> 21:37.300
as well.

21:37.300 --> 21:40.780
Like, and I'm not I'm not shading your life choices like, look, I tried to sell stuff

21:40.780 --> 21:42.360
on the auction house, too.

21:42.360 --> 21:47.260
It just to me, the demand wasn't there and it didn't make it, you know, really worth

21:47.260 --> 21:48.260
it.

21:48.300 --> 21:52.660
Anyway, in the interest of time, since we got a late start, I'm going to move on after

21:52.660 --> 21:53.660
this story.

21:53.660 --> 21:57.820
I'm not trying to write this off and hedge my bets on this will never be a thing or whatever,

21:57.820 --> 22:00.820
but I just.

22:00.820 --> 22:06.700
It's in my opinion, it's going to need to take a company like Nintendo embracing this

22:06.700 --> 22:09.660
before it's going to be a thing in gaming.

22:09.660 --> 22:11.620
And I already see it's not going to happen.

22:11.620 --> 22:13.420
It's never going to happen.

22:13.420 --> 22:15.700
Well, never say never.

22:15.700 --> 22:19.620
But it's it's I'm ninety nine point nine percent.

22:19.620 --> 22:20.620
Yeah.

22:20.620 --> 22:21.620
Yeah.

22:21.620 --> 22:23.820
Especially after some of the choices Nintendo's been.

22:23.820 --> 22:24.820
Oh, yeah.

22:24.820 --> 22:25.820
We'll get to that later.

22:25.820 --> 22:31.340
They'll just do the Nintendo fungible tokens is what they'll have to do something stupid

22:31.340 --> 22:32.340
like that.

22:32.340 --> 22:33.340
But like.

22:33.340 --> 22:40.500
No, I don't think I don't think they even understand the basics of cryptocurrency and

22:40.500 --> 22:42.820
block chain.

22:42.820 --> 22:44.300
That's OK, because I don't either.

22:44.380 --> 22:49.900
All right, let's move on, which I have I have a tiny little bit of cryptocurrency.

22:49.900 --> 22:53.300
I just bought it when all the other you know, when all that crap was going on with GameStop

22:53.300 --> 22:54.300
and all that stuff.

22:54.300 --> 22:55.300
I was like, oh, this would be fun.

22:55.300 --> 23:00.020
I honestly looked at it no different than this is my Reno money that I put into it.

23:00.020 --> 23:01.260
And I've made a little money.

23:01.260 --> 23:07.220
I was at least according to my PayPal wallet, I've made a little money, but I'm not I wouldn't

23:07.220 --> 23:09.660
put my I wouldn't put my life savings in it for sure.

23:09.660 --> 23:10.660
That's for sure.

23:10.660 --> 23:11.660
All right.

23:11.660 --> 23:13.900
It is a fickle fickle thing, though.

23:13.900 --> 23:15.660
Yeah, sure is.

23:15.660 --> 23:19.380
OK, let's move on and talk about our gaming weeks and the types of things that we have

23:19.380 --> 23:22.140
been playing this week, whether they involve Bitcoin or not.

23:22.140 --> 23:23.580
Dark Soccer, I'll start with you.

23:23.580 --> 23:26.100
How was your gaming week?

23:26.100 --> 23:30.380
I played 12 hours worth of Dead by Daylight on Monday.

23:30.380 --> 23:31.380
Yeah.

23:31.380 --> 23:38.340
And then I played two hours of Grinding and Fantation and another hour of Dead by Daylight.

23:38.340 --> 23:46.700
And then pinball where the night I'm flying out to Alabama, which is Thursday night, Dan

23:46.700 --> 23:49.100
is hosting League at our house.

23:49.100 --> 23:50.100
Oh, fun.

23:50.100 --> 23:55.460
So pinballs have been all over the places, pinballs to the wall.

23:55.460 --> 24:00.060
Speaking of which, I was just to say, we should acknowledge California Extreme happened this

24:00.060 --> 24:01.060
weekend.

24:01.060 --> 24:02.060
I know some people that went.

24:02.060 --> 24:04.340
I just wasn't able to get over there.

24:04.340 --> 24:08.740
Dan bought me a badge and I didn't go because I had had my covid booster last week.

24:08.740 --> 24:09.740
Oh, gotcha.

24:09.740 --> 24:14.300
So I was still feeling kind of crappy.

24:14.300 --> 24:17.660
I heard it was a good time from those that went, though, like it's kind of one of those.

24:17.660 --> 24:18.660
We missed it.

24:18.660 --> 24:19.740
It was good to have it back sort of things.

24:19.740 --> 24:25.140
I would have loved to go, but it was like as much as I love that show, the times I've

24:25.140 --> 24:29.120
been, which isn't very often, it's always at like the worst times for me.

24:29.120 --> 24:30.380
And that's nobody's fault.

24:30.380 --> 24:32.340
That's just a scheduling thing.

24:32.340 --> 24:33.340
It is what it is.

24:33.340 --> 24:36.660
I'd love to go again if if it lines up on my calendar someday.

24:36.660 --> 24:42.060
So I know there's anything else you want to share.

24:42.060 --> 24:43.060
I like soda.

24:43.060 --> 24:44.060
Awesome.

24:44.060 --> 24:48.100
All right, let's say hello to Loki and his gaming week.

24:48.100 --> 24:55.940
Yeah, so I played power washing simulator and or power wash simulator and I'm up to

24:55.940 --> 24:57.860
the carousel level now.

24:57.860 --> 24:58.860
Nice.

24:58.860 --> 24:59.860
I'm trying to think.

24:59.860 --> 25:04.820
Like a big treehouse, a helicopter.

25:04.820 --> 25:07.620
I don't remember what else I had.

25:07.620 --> 25:12.780
Oh, like an old like Winnebago or something like that.

25:12.780 --> 25:18.900
But yeah, so it's still fun, though, slowly going through it, run out of things to unlock,

25:18.900 --> 25:21.460
though, as far as like new equipment.

25:21.460 --> 25:25.860
So that's kind of a disappointing, but I know it's still early access.

25:25.860 --> 25:31.020
Yeah, they just did a patch that added new scenes, right?

25:31.020 --> 25:32.020
Yeah.

25:32.020 --> 25:33.020
Yeah.

25:33.020 --> 25:34.420
They keep adding more and more and more levels to it.

25:34.420 --> 25:35.420
So that's good.

25:35.420 --> 25:39.700
I just wish they would have like there's still one more class of like power washer that you

25:39.700 --> 25:43.940
can get, like the industrial strength one or something like that.

25:43.940 --> 25:45.900
And that's just not available yet.

25:45.900 --> 25:52.620
But yeah, I'm like a player that looks like about 15 hours now.

25:52.620 --> 25:57.940
And then, of course, Minecraft playing Minecraft.

25:57.940 --> 26:00.040
So I put out another video, right?

26:00.040 --> 26:05.440
I put out another video, which I finally it's about a week turnaround time that time.

26:05.440 --> 26:08.300
So and I'm already working on stuff for the next one.

26:08.300 --> 26:17.700
So I'm trying to keep up with that, you know, the weekly pace there instead of biweekly

26:17.700 --> 26:20.060
or even more infrequent than that.

26:20.060 --> 26:21.980
It just depends on what I'm putting together.

26:21.980 --> 26:26.140
There's a lot of like complicated builds and stuff that I'm doing, but I'm kind of getting

26:26.140 --> 26:27.140
to the point now.

26:27.140 --> 26:30.700
I've been finishing up the build I'm working on now, but I want to go back to making more

26:30.700 --> 26:31.700
farms.

26:31.700 --> 26:33.700
So I'm probably going to do that.

26:33.700 --> 26:34.940
Nice.

26:34.940 --> 26:37.580
And I know there was some Minecraft news this week, but we'll get into that in a little

26:37.580 --> 26:38.580
bit.

26:38.580 --> 26:39.580
Yes, there was.

26:39.580 --> 26:40.880
All right.

26:40.880 --> 26:41.880
My gaming week.

26:41.880 --> 26:45.640
So I've been trying to stream a little more often after work, and some days were better

26:45.640 --> 26:46.640
than others.

26:46.640 --> 26:50.540
Like Monday, obviously, the power was out, but well, and I wasn't going to stream when

26:50.540 --> 26:52.140
Darkstalker was doing a marathon anyway.

26:52.140 --> 26:56.660
But the other days of the week, I was pretty much able to do stuff.

26:56.660 --> 27:02.700
I streamed some more Metroid Dread, and I got as far as the fight with a very familiar

27:02.700 --> 27:04.740
face from the Metroid series.

27:04.740 --> 27:08.580
I guess, you know, you can read into that what you want.

27:08.580 --> 27:13.440
And the viewers watched me lose that fight probably five or six times.

27:13.440 --> 27:17.780
So I don't know if I just didn't have enough energy tanks or gear or something to take

27:17.780 --> 27:19.020
on that fight.

27:19.020 --> 27:27.080
But I will say one thing that was really holding me back, my wrist started to hurt real bad.

27:27.080 --> 27:30.220
And those of you that were watching know that I called my stream.

27:30.220 --> 27:33.880
I mean, I've been going for an hour and a half, two hours, which is my usual time anyway.

27:33.880 --> 27:37.420
So I didn't feel bad about calling it what I did, but my wrist was really starting to

27:37.420 --> 27:38.420
hurt.

27:38.420 --> 27:43.540
And that kind of reads into my earlier feedback on Metroid Dread that although I think I liked

27:43.540 --> 27:49.220
the game more the second time I played it because I was more set up for what to expect.

27:49.220 --> 27:53.940
And so I was getting more out of a thrill out of those me chase sequences and so forth.

27:53.940 --> 27:58.780
Like the controls is a major problem.

27:58.780 --> 28:04.460
Like my wrist is hurting and like, you know, there's accessibility things that are issue

28:04.460 --> 28:05.460
too.

28:05.460 --> 28:10.700
Nintendo has got to address some some configurability issues with this game.

28:10.700 --> 28:18.020
I don't know, like it's I'm probably going to play more off stream in shorter bursts

28:18.020 --> 28:21.140
so I can, you know, give myself breaks more when I need them.

28:21.140 --> 28:24.780
But that was very disappointing that things got to the point where I was like hurting.

28:24.780 --> 28:28.060
E3VL says, did you play with pro controller?

28:28.060 --> 28:29.260
Yes, I did.

28:29.260 --> 28:31.160
The Splatoon pro controller.

28:31.160 --> 28:34.080
Shad Starsick says, I don't know how people are holding the controllers to make their

28:34.080 --> 28:35.080
wrists hurt.

28:35.080 --> 28:39.140
I went through the entire game with no problems like that.

28:39.140 --> 28:40.140
Congrats for you.

28:40.700 --> 28:43.060
But that is not the case for me.

28:43.060 --> 28:44.060
So I don't know.

28:44.060 --> 28:51.460
So it's like I like the game, but that was a major downer, major downer.

28:51.460 --> 28:52.460
But I'll play it more.

28:52.460 --> 28:55.540
I just won't be doing it on stream anymore because I'm not I won't I'll be doing it for

28:55.540 --> 29:01.100
like 30, 45 minutes at a time so I can give myself frequent breaks.

29:01.100 --> 29:03.300
Shad Starsick also says, oh, you know what?

29:03.300 --> 29:04.840
I didn't use a pro controller.

29:04.840 --> 29:06.420
Maybe that's something to do with it.

29:06.420 --> 29:07.420
Perhaps.

29:07.420 --> 29:10.540
I know you play mostly handheld, so maybe that, you know, kind of because that is a

29:10.540 --> 29:12.260
big difference in how you hold it.

29:12.260 --> 29:13.260
Maybe that did make a difference.

29:13.260 --> 29:14.620
I don't know.

29:14.620 --> 29:15.620
So we'll see.

29:15.620 --> 29:16.620
Let's see.

29:16.620 --> 29:20.020
I did play some other stuff as well.

29:20.020 --> 29:25.420
I also played I got into a new game this week called Dungeon Encounters.

29:25.420 --> 29:26.620
That was interesting.

29:26.620 --> 29:30.140
So that is the game that they showed at, I think, the last Nintendo Direct.

29:30.140 --> 29:34.340
There was kind of a Squeenix game that came out of nowhere that was by the guy who designed

29:34.340 --> 29:38.100
like Final Fantasy 12 and Tactics and stuff like that.

29:38.100 --> 29:42.380
And it just came out on Steam, I think PS4 and Switch this week.

29:42.380 --> 29:43.980
And so I played this game on stream.

29:43.980 --> 29:47.900
It's the one where it looks like you're running around these crossword puzzles that have numbers

29:47.900 --> 29:50.040
in them and you get into these fights.

29:50.040 --> 29:54.060
And that is what the game is.

29:54.060 --> 29:58.660
I played it on stream and about 30 minutes into it, I was like, oh, this game is this

29:58.660 --> 30:00.100
game is terrible.

30:00.100 --> 30:01.380
Like I, I don't know.

30:01.380 --> 30:02.860
I don't know what they were thinking with this.

30:02.860 --> 30:07.080
This is very clearly somebody's art project that's gone really, really wrong.

30:07.080 --> 30:10.640
And that's why this is being released without much fanfare.

30:10.640 --> 30:14.640
But by the time I got to the end of the stream, I started to just kind of notice things about

30:14.640 --> 30:18.760
it where I was like, you know what, you know what I think this is?

30:18.760 --> 30:28.960
I think this game is like a 1980s PC RPG, but done for a PlayStation 4 and Steam.

30:28.960 --> 30:32.780
Like seriously, like when you look at these maps and like the whole thing is that there's

30:32.820 --> 30:38.020
there's no artwork beyond like there's no, there's a stairs drawn that the monsters are

30:38.020 --> 30:39.420
not drawn on the map.

30:39.420 --> 30:42.260
Everything is represented by hexadecimal numbers.

30:42.260 --> 30:45.980
So you have to remember two is a staircase that goes up.

30:45.980 --> 30:48.600
One is a staircase that goes down.

30:48.600 --> 30:51.840
Six is a place that can heal all your life.

30:51.840 --> 30:54.820
Five is a place that you can resurrect everybody.

30:54.820 --> 31:00.760
Now that really reminds me of, I'm, I'm talking to go way back to 80s PC gaming.

31:00.800 --> 31:07.000
I'm not talking about rogue likes, I'm talking about fucking Rogue, the original Rogue.

31:07.000 --> 31:10.320
Anybody ever play Rogue on the PC or whatever it was on?

31:10.320 --> 31:11.320
It was ported to everything.

31:11.320 --> 31:12.320
Ages ago.

31:12.320 --> 31:13.320
Ages ago, right.

31:13.320 --> 31:17.840
And in that game, like monsters were represented by letters of the alphabet.

31:17.840 --> 31:21.280
And so like, like it's that kind of feel.

31:21.280 --> 31:25.760
So I kind of, and it's interesting because some of the puzzles then become, okay, you

31:25.760 --> 31:30.720
have to use these abilities to warp up a floor to where you were to get to this section.

31:30.720 --> 31:35.080
That maybe you weren't able to reach before these, that they are puzzles that are straight

31:35.080 --> 31:41.120
out of like Ultima and those games that were big back in the day then.

31:41.120 --> 31:43.840
Bobby Blackpool says, did you do a steam refund for it?

31:43.840 --> 31:48.080
I thought about it, but I didn't because I let the viewers vote if they wanted to see

31:48.080 --> 31:49.120
it again.

31:49.120 --> 31:51.480
And yes, overwhelmingly won.

31:51.480 --> 31:55.560
So there's that, but also just the fact that by the end of it, I was kind of getting a

31:55.560 --> 32:00.000
little more into it, but I think the game extremely has its shortcomings.

32:00.000 --> 32:02.160
I'm willing to kind of see the puzzles through.

32:02.160 --> 32:09.120
I can deal with a retro inspired game and things like that, but, um, I, I'm just not

32:09.120 --> 32:13.400
sure why they felt getting rid of art direction altogether.

32:13.400 --> 32:18.600
Well, I guess I shouldn't say that because I mean, they did design still pictures of

32:18.600 --> 32:19.600
characters.

32:19.600 --> 32:20.600
I mean, it's very minimal.

32:20.600 --> 32:21.600
This game is very minimalist.

32:21.600 --> 32:25.940
And I said that word a lot on the stream was a real choice for this game.

32:25.940 --> 32:32.680
I'm telling you, if they had taken this same game and use that same engine that they're

32:32.680 --> 32:37.400
using for Bravely default, and now the triangle strategy game, whatever that is, if they'd

32:37.400 --> 32:42.300
use that same engine, they'd actually drawn assets instead of numbers for some of those

32:42.300 --> 32:46.340
things, but use the same maps and dungeons made the battles work the same because the

32:46.340 --> 32:50.140
battle system is interesting because you have like a physical defense shield and a magical

32:50.140 --> 32:52.660
defense shield, and then you have the HP underneath that.

32:52.660 --> 32:55.920
So you have to crack through one of the shields before you get to the health.

32:55.920 --> 32:57.100
It's an interesting mechanic.

32:57.100 --> 33:03.900
All they had to do was use like the, um, Octopath traveler interface and that whole thing for

33:03.900 --> 33:04.900
that.

33:04.900 --> 33:09.100
And I honestly think they would have had a hit on their hands.

33:09.100 --> 33:16.740
I don't know why they decided to keep this minimalist eighties RPG in auto PlayStation

33:16.740 --> 33:18.580
four type of thing.

33:18.580 --> 33:20.060
Was it worth $30?

33:20.060 --> 33:23.900
No, I don't think so.

33:24.200 --> 33:27.560
I know there's going to, I know there's going to be people, I, the thing is this game is

33:27.560 --> 33:32.800
going to have it's dedicated fans, but I think most people aren't going to get it.

33:32.800 --> 33:35.920
I barely get it.

33:35.920 --> 33:39.160
So I just, I think it's on four.

33:39.160 --> 33:44.260
I think, again, I think I just told you how this game could have been like 10 times better

33:44.260 --> 33:49.280
is to take down some of those minimalist walls and adapt an engine that you've already been

33:49.280 --> 33:53.500
using on other projects and play it to this vision of how the battle should run and things

33:53.500 --> 33:54.500
like that.

33:54.500 --> 33:56.200
And I think you would have had a hit on your hands.

33:56.200 --> 33:58.200
Oh, well.

33:58.200 --> 34:01.040
Anyway, um, let's see.

34:01.040 --> 34:04.720
Um, other games I played this week, I guess I streamed a little bit of dead by daylight

34:04.720 --> 34:05.760
on Friday.

34:05.760 --> 34:08.120
I've decided I'm retired from cookie clicker.

34:08.120 --> 34:09.360
I have clicked all the cookies.

34:09.360 --> 34:10.360
I will click.

34:10.360 --> 34:11.360
Yes, I'm done.

34:11.360 --> 34:16.120
I'm done because I've hit the point where it's like, I've gotten every, every, except

34:16.120 --> 34:19.560
for one heavenly Ascension talent, which most people will play a game.

34:19.560 --> 34:22.840
Don't even know what the fuck that is, but that's when you ascend by getting so many

34:22.840 --> 34:24.220
cookies and start the game over.

34:24.220 --> 34:25.580
You get talents that roll over.

34:25.580 --> 34:30.260
I have all of them except for one, which is a very specific hard to do thing that I just

34:30.260 --> 34:32.000
don't feel like doing.

34:32.000 --> 34:37.780
And for those that know cookie clicker, it's the one where you ascend the chips as 777777.

34:37.780 --> 34:41.620
You have to have all six of the last digit sevens, uh, to get the last one.

34:41.620 --> 34:42.620
I got the other two.

34:42.620 --> 34:44.020
That's just seven and seven, seven, seven.

34:44.020 --> 34:45.860
And the 777 one was annoying enough.

34:45.860 --> 34:47.020
I didn't want to do the other one.

34:47.020 --> 34:48.780
Yes, I know you sell your buildings.

34:48.780 --> 34:49.780
So you go slower.

34:49.780 --> 34:50.780
Did I know how to do it?

34:51.000 --> 34:52.840
I just don't want to do it.

34:52.840 --> 34:55.860
And I'm not going to do something in a video game I don't want to do.

34:55.860 --> 34:58.360
So I've decided to retire from the cookies.

34:58.360 --> 35:02.500
I got like 430 something achievements in that game.

35:02.500 --> 35:03.500
I'm good.

35:03.500 --> 35:06.000
I'm, I'm never going to get that many achievements in a video game.

35:06.000 --> 35:09.240
One other game I played a little bit of this week, Diablo two resurrected.

35:09.240 --> 35:12.280
So I did finally pick that up and I've put a little time into that.

35:12.280 --> 35:17.280
And that, so it's interesting because that is a old, old school at this point, right?

35:17.280 --> 35:19.920
From like the late nineties, uh, RPG.

35:19.920 --> 35:25.580
And so some of those elements haven't aged well, especially the quality of life stuff.

35:25.580 --> 35:30.740
But with that one, especially with the nicer graphics and everything looks really sharp

35:30.740 --> 35:33.240
and I'm actually enjoying it.

35:33.240 --> 35:37.280
Even though I'm like, God, it's a pain in the ass to keep going back to town and stuff.

35:37.280 --> 35:38.880
It doesn't bother me.

35:38.880 --> 35:40.220
Like I'm actually kind of enjoying it.

35:40.220 --> 35:44.300
And I think they did a really good job with that.

35:44.300 --> 35:47.140
Bobby Black Wolf in chat says, grandma is sad, Rob.

35:47.140 --> 35:49.560
Well, the aliens ate her.

35:49.560 --> 35:50.560
Spoiler alert.

35:50.560 --> 35:51.560
All right.

35:51.560 --> 35:54.720
Uh, E3VL says, did you get login issues?

35:54.720 --> 36:00.080
I got a queue of 17 on Saturday, but otherwise to dodge the login issues in that game for

36:00.080 --> 36:01.080
the most.

36:01.080 --> 36:04.800
I heard it was pretty bad, but for the, for E as of now, it hasn't really hit me yet.

36:04.800 --> 36:07.020
So, all right, let's move on.

36:07.020 --> 36:08.020
We got a late start tonight.

36:08.020 --> 36:11.400
So I want to jump into some news, uh, again, housekeeping.

36:11.400 --> 36:15.560
We will not be here live next week, Halloween.

36:15.560 --> 36:16.720
I haven't figured out yet.

36:16.720 --> 36:20.600
I meant to talk about this with my goes before we were live, but then the whole power out

36:20.600 --> 36:21.600
of situation.

36:21.600 --> 36:24.080
Is anyone else going to be here on Halloween night?

36:24.080 --> 36:25.200
Yes.

36:25.200 --> 36:26.200
You will be here.

36:26.200 --> 36:27.200
It's true.

36:27.200 --> 36:28.200
Okay.

36:28.200 --> 36:31.200
So Jamie and I will be here that night with a show.

36:31.200 --> 36:35.480
Uh, Loki gets the night off to spend with kids so that I just don't want to go two weeks

36:35.480 --> 36:36.600
without a show if we can help it.

36:36.600 --> 36:40.360
So, um, but if you want to do a segment in advance or something, Loki, we can always

36:40.360 --> 36:41.360
do that.

36:41.360 --> 36:43.400
So, all right, we'll see what's going on that week.

36:43.400 --> 36:44.400
All right.

36:44.400 --> 36:45.400
Good times.

36:45.400 --> 36:46.400
All right.

36:47.080 --> 36:48.080
Halloween night.

36:48.080 --> 36:49.800
So dark soccer and I will scare you.

36:49.800 --> 36:55.640
Maybe, maybe if we have a short show, maybe I'll let her kill me again in dead by daylight.

36:55.640 --> 36:56.920
Cause that was kind of fun.

36:56.920 --> 36:59.040
Dude, the kill your friends thing is fun.

36:59.040 --> 37:02.520
Did you see my very, very, very slow, uh, piggy tea bag?

37:02.520 --> 37:04.080
I mean, yeah, yes I did.

37:04.080 --> 37:07.040
And that kill your friends thing was very one-sided.

37:07.040 --> 37:10.280
It's very hard to do when there's only two survivors, but it was more about, it really

37:10.280 --> 37:15.320
is hard with only two in that love in the corn it is for me.

37:15.320 --> 37:18.640
It was more about just getting to throw the pallet down on you and then teabag you.

37:18.640 --> 37:24.720
And I was satisfied because I was like, I know she's cussing me out.

37:24.720 --> 37:31.120
I was most of the time going, Oh, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, no, Rob, no.

37:31.120 --> 37:32.120
All right.

37:32.120 --> 37:34.000
Uh, let's move on to some news.

37:34.000 --> 37:38.640
So we won't be here next week while, um, dark soccer is out in Alabama and that's a very

37:38.640 --> 37:40.360
serious thing.

37:40.360 --> 37:42.440
I'm going to Disneyland next week.

37:42.440 --> 37:46.560
So, um, uh, if, if they, if Disneyland hadn't gotten rid of Duffy, I would have brought

37:46.560 --> 37:50.320
you back a Duffy, something dark soccer, but, um, I don't know.

37:50.320 --> 37:52.320
Do you still do pins?

37:52.320 --> 37:57.720
I do still do, do pins and you know, I love Tron stuff.

37:57.720 --> 38:02.120
Well, so do I, so if I find it, I'll be buying it for myself, but if I find two, if Alan

38:02.120 --> 38:04.160
does this take the Maleficent stuff.

38:04.160 --> 38:05.160
Okay.

38:05.160 --> 38:06.160
Fair.

38:06.160 --> 38:07.160
Fair.

38:07.160 --> 38:08.160
All right.

38:08.160 --> 38:10.240
Um, I just want to see how much of the parks we can get done in a day.

38:10.240 --> 38:11.960
So we're only going for the one day.

38:11.960 --> 38:17.000
So I really want to ride some of the new stuff are like, yeah, I'm, I'm curious about how

38:17.000 --> 38:20.360
that's going to feel with COVID and everything too, but I figured, you know what, if I got

38:20.360 --> 38:25.320
through dragon con, I'll get through this and I'm vaccinated, I have no problem with

38:25.320 --> 38:26.320
masks, whatever.

38:26.320 --> 38:27.320
It'll be fine.

38:27.320 --> 38:28.320
The number is a booster.

38:28.320 --> 38:29.320
Yeah.

38:29.320 --> 38:33.480
I want to get a, well, I want to get a booster, but at the same time I have Moderna, so we're

38:33.480 --> 38:34.480
kind of waiting.

38:34.480 --> 38:35.480
Yeah.

38:35.480 --> 38:36.480
It hurts.

38:36.480 --> 38:37.480
It still hurts.

38:37.480 --> 38:38.480
I'm still right here.

38:38.480 --> 38:40.120
It's still really tender.

38:40.120 --> 38:41.400
You know what really hurts?

38:41.400 --> 38:42.400
What?

38:42.400 --> 38:43.400
COVID-19.

38:43.400 --> 38:44.400
All right.

38:44.400 --> 38:45.400
Well, duh.

38:45.400 --> 38:51.240
But I'm still saying that this, this one hurt worse than the other, the other two.

38:51.240 --> 38:54.360
Most people said this, the third wasn't as bad as the second.

38:54.360 --> 38:55.360
Hmm.

38:55.360 --> 38:56.360
Interesting.

38:56.360 --> 38:57.360
All right.

38:57.360 --> 38:58.920
But I also have another condition, so.

38:58.920 --> 38:59.920
Ah, fair.

38:59.920 --> 39:00.920
All right.

39:00.920 --> 39:01.920
Um, let's move on.

39:01.920 --> 39:04.080
We got some gaming news to get to as promised.

39:04.080 --> 39:06.600
Loki is going to talk about his fave.

39:06.600 --> 39:07.600
Minecraft.

39:07.600 --> 39:08.600
Yes.

39:08.600 --> 39:09.600
We're going to talk about Minecraft.

39:10.080 --> 39:13.840
So Minecraft live 2021 was this weekend and we had lots of announcements.

39:13.840 --> 39:18.320
So this is normally the event, normally in the past when we're not in COVID, it would

39:18.320 --> 39:22.440
be a live event that you would be able to go to and experience everything kind of like

39:22.440 --> 39:27.780
a fan festival, but the last few years have been just purely digital.

39:27.780 --> 39:30.980
So they talked about, you know, new updates coming out.

39:30.980 --> 39:33.860
Obviously we have one 18 right around the corner by the end of this year.

39:33.860 --> 39:38.000
So they talked about some of the updates with that, just kind of showcasing, you know, some

39:38.000 --> 39:40.640
of the changes that are becoming, which we kind of knew anyways, because they're doing

39:40.640 --> 39:46.080
the snapshot, uh, releases, um, until the final release comes out.

39:46.080 --> 39:51.560
Um, but then of course we got the news that the deep dark and the warden have been delayed

39:51.560 --> 39:55.680
to one 19, but then they finally showed off what they're doing with that.

39:55.680 --> 39:57.720
And they're really, you've expanded it out now.

39:57.720 --> 40:02.440
So the one 19 update, which is coming out next year is going to be called the wild update.

40:02.440 --> 40:04.940
And it adds, uh, lots of different changes to it.

40:04.940 --> 40:07.800
One being of course, adding the deep dark to it.

40:07.800 --> 40:12.520
The deep dark for those who don't know, is a very, very scary place that they've added

40:12.520 --> 40:13.520
to Minecraft.

40:13.520 --> 40:15.320
It's almost like a horror update.

40:15.320 --> 40:21.880
Um, it's this place where there's a bunch of these like kind of growths on the ground

40:21.880 --> 40:27.300
that are all triggered by sound and it can cause this thing that basically creates darkness.

40:27.300 --> 40:31.120
And then the warden is this giant monster that comes out of the ground.

40:31.120 --> 40:34.760
Um, if you make too much noise, it's very crazy.

40:34.760 --> 40:35.760
You got it.

40:35.760 --> 40:39.040
You got to honestly watch the trailers because the sound design that they have in there,

40:39.040 --> 40:41.560
although the environment sounds, it's just so freaky.

40:41.560 --> 40:45.760
Like I can't wait to play it because it, I remember when I first played Minecraft on

40:45.760 --> 40:50.800
the Xbox 360, like when you don't know what anything is and you know, like, okay, well

40:50.800 --> 40:52.440
creepers are going to blow up and they're going to kill me.

40:52.440 --> 40:55.960
And I remember how like scared I really was, you know, with the creepers.

40:55.960 --> 40:57.600
Why are we talking past tense?

40:57.600 --> 41:01.880
That shit still scares me when I play Minecraft now and now it's not so bad.

41:01.880 --> 41:05.480
Like, you know, like if I run across enemies, I know I'm not too worried about them, but

41:05.480 --> 41:09.000
like before it was like, Oh my God, I got like, you got to hide in the house, you know,

41:09.000 --> 41:10.140
through the night and stuff like that.

41:10.140 --> 41:13.760
But now do you know what creepers need?

41:13.760 --> 41:15.840
Creepers need the terror radius from dead by daylight.

41:15.840 --> 41:16.840
That's what they need.

41:16.840 --> 41:20.280
So you have that heartbeat anyway.

41:20.280 --> 41:21.280
And the red stain.

41:21.280 --> 41:22.280
Yes.

41:22.280 --> 41:26.280
So, yeah, so that was on the, the announced that all the different stuff they're adding

41:26.280 --> 41:31.400
to like the skull sensor and the skull shrieker is the one that causes the darkness and it's

41:31.440 --> 41:33.080
the effect is just really awesome.

41:33.080 --> 41:38.000
But outside of that, though, the wildlife is going to do some revamps for existing biomes.

41:38.000 --> 41:41.160
So they're going to be updating the swamp biome.

41:41.160 --> 41:45.440
With that, they're going to be adding some new biomes, including mangrove trees, which

41:45.440 --> 41:46.920
is pretty cool.

41:46.920 --> 41:49.480
Chest boats, frogs.

41:49.480 --> 41:52.640
They're going to add mud into the game, which is going to be a new block.

41:52.640 --> 41:54.560
You can make mud bricks now.

41:54.560 --> 41:57.120
And then of course, fireflies, which would be pretty cool.

41:57.120 --> 42:00.440
That's just some of this other time, but they're also going to be redoing the birch forest.

42:00.440 --> 42:03.800
And I think that there's probably going to be even more biomes that they go through and

42:03.800 --> 42:04.800
kind of overhaul.

42:04.800 --> 42:07.200
But those are kind of the stuff that they showed off right now.

42:07.200 --> 42:12.000
But they're trying to focus more on like the environment and bringing like the nature part

42:12.000 --> 42:13.000
out of things.

42:13.000 --> 42:16.280
So maybe environment sounds and whatnot.

42:16.280 --> 42:20.120
So that was a lot of stuff that they talked about, like actual Java Minecraft in Bedrock.

42:20.120 --> 42:26.600
Loki, but but if they're adding mud, can I get naked and wear nothing but mud?

42:26.600 --> 42:29.680
I mean, no, you can't.

42:29.680 --> 42:30.960
You can't wear mud.

42:30.960 --> 42:33.000
What kind of fake ass game is this?

42:33.000 --> 42:35.280
You can make your skin look like mud.

42:35.280 --> 42:37.000
But yeah.

42:37.000 --> 42:42.680
So other cool things that they announced that starting November, Games Pass is going to

42:42.680 --> 42:46.400
have Minecraft on PC.

42:46.400 --> 42:51.880
So that includes both the Windows 10 edition, which is Bedrock and the Java edition.

42:51.880 --> 42:55.560
So that'll be included with Games Pass, which is pretty awesome.

42:55.560 --> 42:59.280
Along with that, they're showing off some updates for Minecraft Dungeons.

42:59.280 --> 43:03.480
So Minecraft Dungeons is going to get something similar to what we have in Diablo 3, where

43:03.480 --> 43:07.040
they have like the different seasonal events that go on.

43:07.040 --> 43:12.600
So they're going to have these seasonal adventures, as well as this Cloudy Climb and the Echoing

43:12.600 --> 43:16.160
Void DLC, which looks interesting.

43:16.160 --> 43:20.160
And then of course, they did the mob vote this year as well.

43:20.160 --> 43:24.360
So they announced a few different mobs that they're going to be adding to the game.

43:24.440 --> 43:29.560
The Alay one, which is kind of like this fairy creature thing that's able to gather items

43:29.560 --> 43:31.440
for you.

43:31.440 --> 43:34.520
They have like a copper golem was another one that would have been pretty cool.

43:34.520 --> 43:36.640
It's got like a little robot thing.

43:36.640 --> 43:41.200
And then this Alay, which looks like a flying Oscar the Grouch, which I'm not really or

43:41.200 --> 43:47.280
not the Alay, but the the glare, which would point out where dark places are like I'd like

43:47.280 --> 43:51.920
I need something to point out where it's dark.

43:51.920 --> 43:54.440
So yeah, lots of big announcements.

43:54.440 --> 43:56.000
Very excited about the updates.

43:56.000 --> 44:02.720
Definitely go watch the trailer for the deep dark stuff because oh my God, it looks really

44:02.720 --> 44:06.040
cool, but also really creepy.

44:06.040 --> 44:08.600
But I'm very much looking forward to that next year.

44:08.600 --> 44:11.880
It's nice to see that there's still quite a variety of content still being planned for

44:11.880 --> 44:14.320
that game when you consider how old it is.

44:14.320 --> 44:19.280
Well, you've got to see 1.18 is going to completely redesign like everything in the game.

44:19.440 --> 44:24.720
It's going to completely redesign the caves in the game, making it very interesting and

44:24.720 --> 44:25.720
adding a lot more features.

44:25.720 --> 44:28.720
So that alone is going to totally change the game.

44:28.720 --> 44:32.720
And then all these additional features are going back and kind of instead of say, OK,

44:32.720 --> 44:36.400
well, this is a birch forest and it looks exactly like a regular forest, but there's

44:36.400 --> 44:41.240
birch trees and they're actually making things very distinct and adding the small details

44:41.240 --> 44:42.560
in there.

44:42.560 --> 44:47.120
All right, well, I look forward to your videos showing them all off.

44:47.120 --> 44:48.880
Yes, of course.

44:48.880 --> 44:54.560
All right, moving on, let's let's talk about, OK, so another crafting game of a different

44:54.560 --> 44:58.960
sort and one that consumed our lives last year, Animal Crossing.

44:58.960 --> 45:00.880
And this week, pay attention to our saga.

45:00.880 --> 45:02.600
This week we watch the whole thing.

45:02.600 --> 45:03.600
Did you?

45:03.600 --> 45:04.600
All right.

45:04.600 --> 45:09.440
We had a whole direct dedicated to Animal Crossing and there is going to be one more

45:09.440 --> 45:10.440
free update.

45:10.440 --> 45:11.760
And they are saying this is the last one.

45:11.760 --> 45:16.240
There's a 2.0 update coming November 5th and there's going to be some new characters coming

45:16.240 --> 45:17.240
for.

45:17.240 --> 45:19.120
Well, new old characters, the Animal Crossing series.

45:19.120 --> 45:22.800
So some of the characters they kind of left out from last time are going to be added to

45:22.800 --> 45:24.080
the game.

45:24.080 --> 45:28.520
They're actually going to add Brewster as well, who's going to open up a not Starbucks,

45:28.520 --> 45:34.600
but some type of coffee cafe that's at the Roost, the Roost, which is inspired from the

45:34.600 --> 45:38.040
DS games right where that first appeared.

45:38.040 --> 45:39.040
Right.

45:39.040 --> 45:41.120
Also, Cap'n is coming back.

45:41.120 --> 45:46.680
So even though there's no island to visit per se, Cap'n is still going to oh, no, I

45:46.680 --> 45:49.240
guess he is taking you to different islands with his boat.

45:49.240 --> 45:50.240
So I don't know what we're going to find on them.

45:50.240 --> 45:52.800
And it has Katrina and all the other folks there.

45:52.800 --> 45:53.800
Oh, OK.

45:53.800 --> 45:55.240
That'll be cool.

45:55.240 --> 45:56.320
So that's neat.

45:56.320 --> 45:59.000
There's also going to be some more shops at Harv's Island.

45:59.000 --> 46:00.920
That island already exists.

46:00.920 --> 46:03.440
There will be cooking and growing vegetables.

46:03.440 --> 46:07.780
So I think because they datamined like pumpkin and stuff in that game a long time ago, right?

46:07.780 --> 46:10.840
So there's other vegetables that will be or squash or something that's going to be coming

46:10.840 --> 46:12.200
to the game for that.

46:12.200 --> 46:17.120
So that's so all that stuff they datamined forever ago finally coming to the game.

46:17.120 --> 46:23.600
Also coming out is the only I said the first and I assume only paid DLC for Animal Crossing

46:23.600 --> 46:25.960
is going to be Happy Home Paradise.

46:25.960 --> 46:30.360
I, of course, instantly thought of Dark Sakura and all the time she spent playing Happy Home

46:30.360 --> 46:36.320
Designer, because this is basically that right.

46:36.320 --> 46:38.760
Happy Home Paradise is basically that right.

46:38.760 --> 46:41.240
I have to pay the twenty five bucks for it.

46:41.240 --> 46:43.720
Well, they also have it like where you can design.

46:43.720 --> 46:44.880
It's not just homes, though.

46:44.880 --> 46:47.800
You're doing like schools and theaters and stuff like that, too.

46:47.800 --> 46:48.800
Yeah.

46:48.800 --> 46:50.520
That's what it was like in Happy Home Designer, too.

46:50.520 --> 46:56.120
You had different themes and stuff, but you also had to do that when you're designing

46:56.120 --> 47:03.620
like you're shopping, plus the and everything to the last in the DS one.

47:03.620 --> 47:07.960
The thing I'm most excited about are the gyroids are coming back to the game finally.

47:07.960 --> 47:10.200
So that will get me to visit the island.

47:10.200 --> 47:13.180
And I'm sure ketchup is going to ask me where the fuck have you been, asshole?

47:13.180 --> 47:14.720
So we'll see.

47:14.720 --> 47:19.160
I'm sure a lot of people are going to probably visit their town for the first time in a while

47:19.160 --> 47:20.160
with this.

47:20.160 --> 47:23.480
I mean, our soccer, even you kind of stop the daily grind of Animal Crossing.

47:23.480 --> 47:26.160
But is this is this enough to get you to fire up?

47:26.160 --> 47:28.520
No, I'm definitely going to definitely going to come back.

47:28.520 --> 47:32.880
I think I like also that those islands that they have for captain now where you can go

47:32.880 --> 47:35.600
there and the islands are different.

47:35.600 --> 47:39.840
They could be different seasons or time of day, which is kind of interesting.

47:39.840 --> 47:43.680
So you don't really necessarily time travel.

47:43.680 --> 47:45.080
So they've got that in there as well.

47:45.080 --> 47:49.020
Plus, they're going to have like unique stuff that you can do in there.

47:49.020 --> 47:52.840
I like all the different like building stuff you can do there with the where you can add

47:52.840 --> 47:54.760
permanent ladders and whatnot.

47:54.760 --> 47:57.120
I think that's pretty cool.

47:57.120 --> 48:01.560
Looking in chat, a fifth dream says I hate digging up gyroids, but them reacting to music

48:01.560 --> 48:02.560
will be great.

48:02.560 --> 48:05.920
E3VL sharing the island friend code there in chat.

48:05.920 --> 48:07.120
I love that.

48:07.120 --> 48:09.400
Also saying I stopped playing back in June.

48:09.400 --> 48:13.240
Love the new content, but too much of a time commitment for me to start up again.

48:13.240 --> 48:16.680
See a Tiberian chat says it looks like the happy home design DLC is going to permit some

48:16.680 --> 48:19.160
additional villagers to be more permanent.

48:19.160 --> 48:22.360
I thought that was part of the update was that more villagers because I know there's

48:22.360 --> 48:26.220
going to be new new amiibo cards and everything to to support some of the new villagers.

48:26.220 --> 48:30.720
So I'm not sure I have to be honest, I had to read the cliff notes because I wasn't able

48:30.720 --> 48:31.720
to watch the thing live.

48:31.720 --> 48:33.600
So I didn't see everything.

48:33.600 --> 48:36.520
But Dark Saga, did you catch how the new villagers work?

48:36.520 --> 48:39.760
Is that just villagers they're adding or are they tied to the happy home design deal?

48:39.760 --> 48:40.840
I missed that.

48:40.840 --> 48:42.960
I didn't see that part.

48:42.960 --> 48:48.000
I didn't see anything about new villagers, but they did mention that you can use those

48:48.000 --> 48:52.960
cards, I think, to invite them to come to Brewster's.

48:52.960 --> 48:53.960
Maybe that's what it is.

48:53.960 --> 48:57.600
Basically, they have them come join you for coffee.

48:57.600 --> 48:58.600
But I don't know.

48:58.600 --> 48:59.600
They didn't.

48:59.600 --> 49:01.280
I don't think they mentioned anything about adding villagers.

49:01.280 --> 49:05.320
The only thing they said is that they've added additional bridges so you can do a total of

49:05.320 --> 49:10.240
10 bridges and 10 slopes now instead of eight.

49:10.240 --> 49:11.960
And what else?

49:11.960 --> 49:16.440
They also have that shed that you can get like a almost like a gardening shed or something

49:16.440 --> 49:20.080
that you can access your home inventory outside your home.

49:20.080 --> 49:24.000
You can put that anywhere in your map, which is kind of cool.

49:24.000 --> 49:27.320
There's lots of things that they're announcing.

49:27.360 --> 49:31.080
I mean, it's a very robust update, that's for sure.

49:31.080 --> 49:36.360
Yeah, it's definitely it's this feels a little late in the cycle for this to come out, but

49:36.360 --> 49:40.360
I understand Covid probably screwed a lot of stuff up, so I'm not being too critical.

49:40.360 --> 49:42.440
Yeah, Covid, how dare you?

49:42.440 --> 49:47.000
So but yeah, this will be a nice kind of way to wrap this all up.

49:47.000 --> 49:50.000
And then I'm assuming they're going to move on to the next Animal Crossing game after

49:50.000 --> 49:51.000
this.

49:51.000 --> 49:52.000
But we'll see.

49:52.000 --> 49:53.000
All right.

49:53.160 --> 49:58.200
Anyway, let's move on, because there was another big thing that kind of got detailed that same

49:58.200 --> 50:02.160
day because it goes along with that DLC that our soccer was talking about.

50:02.160 --> 50:03.560
This is this.

50:03.560 --> 50:07.080
This could have easily been the kickoff tonight because a lot of people talking about this,

50:07.080 --> 50:08.560
but there's some drama.

50:08.560 --> 50:12.520
Nintendo's been our kickoff a lot, so I have feelings about this.

50:12.520 --> 50:15.040
Yeah, well, let's get to it.

50:15.080 --> 50:23.000
So one of the other things that was listed was a Nintendo Switch online expansion pack.

50:23.000 --> 50:27.120
And I'll just go ahead and go through the basics on it.

50:27.120 --> 50:31.080
It's expanding the subscription service with a premium tier.

50:31.080 --> 50:38.800
It's going to happen later this month, around October 25th, that it is going to have the

50:38.800 --> 50:46.080
base service plus additional items such as a library of Nintendo 64 and Sega Genesis

50:46.080 --> 50:47.720
games.

50:47.720 --> 50:55.200
Individual membership will be 50 bucks, and then a family membership will be 80 bucks.

50:55.200 --> 50:58.440
And people are like, why?

50:58.440 --> 50:59.440
This is expensive.

50:59.440 --> 51:00.440
Why?

51:00.440 --> 51:01.640
And they're pretty pissed about it.

51:01.640 --> 51:06.720
I mean, there's even like the boycott the thing and they'll be forced to lower the price.

51:06.720 --> 51:07.760
This is Nintendo.

51:07.760 --> 51:08.920
People are going to pay for it.

51:08.920 --> 51:10.240
They don't care.

51:10.240 --> 51:11.680
You can sort of call me people.

51:11.680 --> 51:15.160
I'm not quite at the extent that you're at, but I'm very much of the mindset.

51:15.160 --> 51:18.960
Vote with your wallet and I will be voting no on this.

51:18.960 --> 51:25.120
Like this is, I mean, I can sort of see where folks can justify the price a little easier

51:25.120 --> 51:29.640
if they were planning on getting this Happy Home Design DLC anyway.

51:29.640 --> 51:31.120
I'm getting the DLC.

51:31.120 --> 51:32.120
Yeah.

51:32.120 --> 51:36.120
But are you going to get this super expansion pack thingy?

51:36.120 --> 51:41.440
If the person who manages the family plan that I am a member of wants to, I will gladly

51:41.440 --> 51:43.440
pay more for my part of it.

51:43.440 --> 51:45.760
It's it's and it's probably a better deal on the family plan.

51:45.760 --> 51:48.560
In fact, I know it is, but I'm not on that.

51:48.560 --> 51:49.880
So let me let me see.

51:49.880 --> 51:52.800
30 bucks more for up to eight users.

51:52.800 --> 52:00.800
So keep in mind, that would roughly be for for a year of this, mind you, 10 bucks per

52:00.800 --> 52:05.200
person for a year on a family plan.

52:05.280 --> 52:12.560
Yeah, I'm I'm not pissed about it, but I you know, I'm not on a family plan and I don't

52:12.560 --> 52:14.560
know. I'm on the plan with with JD.

52:14.560 --> 52:19.080
Sure. And people could say, well, Rob, you should get on a family plan.

52:19.080 --> 52:21.920
And I would say, y'all are game in the system anyway.

52:21.920 --> 52:24.320
So whatever, you know, which is fine.

52:24.320 --> 52:27.920
Which there's nothing wrong. You're working within the confines that Nintendo gave you.

52:29.040 --> 52:32.760
But speaking as somebody who is not on one of these shared family plans or whatever, and

52:32.760 --> 52:37.800
even if I was a Mike Defton chat says that he voted no, but the rest of the people on his

52:37.800 --> 52:39.120
family plan voted yes.

52:39.120 --> 52:40.800
So they're going to be upgrading to this.

52:41.560 --> 52:44.000
I think I think this is crap.

52:44.480 --> 52:46.600
I think this is really crap what they're doing.

52:46.600 --> 52:52.920
I think this is this is crap to the level that like somebody in a higher up at Nintendo

52:52.920 --> 52:54.920
ought to have their role reexamined.

52:54.920 --> 52:58.360
This is so bad because this value is garbage.

52:58.600 --> 53:01.600
And what's really irritating about it.

53:01.600 --> 53:05.880
It's not even just the value that's that's because, you know, sure, you get the Happy Home

53:05.880 --> 53:08.440
Designer DLC, you know, quote unquote free.

53:08.640 --> 53:10.800
But this claim, though, can I finish?

53:10.800 --> 53:12.040
Can I finish? Can I finish?

53:12.400 --> 53:18.240
Because that is just for this year, because next year you're going to have to re up and pay

53:18.240 --> 53:19.640
that DLC again.

53:19.640 --> 53:24.760
You know, it's going to be like PlayStation Plus or, you know, Xbox Gold or whatever, where

53:24.760 --> 53:27.800
once you stop paying, then you no longer have that DLC.

53:27.920 --> 53:32.800
For most people, a year is probably enough to well experience the Happy Home Designer DLC,

53:32.800 --> 53:37.840
whatever. But I think this whole fact that the games that they're including with the N64 and

53:37.840 --> 53:41.440
the Genesis stuff, it's it's not up to the level to justify that cost.

53:41.600 --> 53:44.160
And this is what really irritates me.

53:44.160 --> 53:45.680
And fucking wait, people.

53:46.760 --> 53:52.240
This is what's going to happen, because because the value of this higher dollar plan is so

53:52.240 --> 53:56.000
bad, they're going to have to start to dump more into it.

53:56.400 --> 54:02.600
And so what's now now Nintendo for no reason has created two levels of this Nintendo online

54:02.840 --> 54:08.240
and this base plan that's been giving us Tetris 99, Mario 99 and all this stuff.

54:09.000 --> 54:11.920
Get ready, because all that's going to go away and get.

54:12.160 --> 54:16.040
Now, I'm not saying they're going to take away those specific games, but the future stuff

54:16.040 --> 54:19.440
is going to go to the higher dollar plan, because that's where Nintendo wants to put the

54:19.440 --> 54:24.320
people. Honestly, they should have just probably upped the price for everybody by 10

54:24.320 --> 54:28.000
bucks and thrown all this in and just said, here's what we're doing to justify the price

54:28.000 --> 54:32.400
cost. And I would probably feel a lot I wouldn't feel so much like, well, those of us that

54:32.400 --> 54:35.280
opt to keep the base plan are going to get fucked over like I feel now.

54:35.560 --> 54:38.800
I think this whole like two track thing is disaster in the making.

54:39.440 --> 54:42.840
Well, and here's the problem, too, is like you raise the price, you're going to raise the

54:42.840 --> 54:44.240
expectations of that service.

54:44.240 --> 54:49.040
A lot of people have been kind of letting them get letting it slide when it comes to poor

54:49.040 --> 54:53.240
performance on this Nintendo online because, well, it's only 20 bucks a year, you know,

54:53.240 --> 54:58.440
whatever, you know, but now that it's it's comparable to the other services now that level

54:58.440 --> 55:00.160
of expectations can be higher, too.

55:00.240 --> 55:05.920
And I'm sorry, like, yeah, I get it that your Nintendo 64 games are pretty cool, but you

55:05.920 --> 55:10.920
know what, though, like I'm getting sixty dollar free games or games that were like, you

55:10.920 --> 55:13.400
know, triple-A quality games that are recent.

55:14.480 --> 55:18.880
To a month, at least with these services, these other services I'm paying for, like.

55:19.880 --> 55:25.600
You know how Nintendo has not shown that they can put out games on a consistent basis within

55:25.600 --> 55:31.600
those online collections, it's just and it's really scraping the bottom of the barrel

55:31.600 --> 55:32.320
sometimes of that.

55:33.000 --> 55:35.320
OK, yeah, Super Mario 64 is a great game.

55:35.360 --> 55:36.040
Well, you know what?

55:36.040 --> 55:41.480
You sold Super Mario 64, then you stop selling it on purpose so that you could then raise

55:41.480 --> 55:42.400
the price on this.

55:42.800 --> 55:45.520
Like, it's just it's absolutely stupid.

55:45.520 --> 55:49.400
I'm just not interested in in ponying up for this new scheme, and I know I'm going to

55:49.400 --> 55:53.560
regret it probably down the road, but like the reality is, well, I mean, I can always buy

55:53.560 --> 55:55.760
it later, I guess there's nothing to make me get it right now.

55:55.760 --> 55:58.560
Certainly there's nothing and maybe that's exactly what it is.

55:58.600 --> 56:02.480
There's nothing motivating for me right now on October 25th to upgrade to this.

56:02.520 --> 56:03.400
So I'm not going to.

56:03.440 --> 56:04.480
I'm not upgrading.

56:04.480 --> 56:07.960
And the only thing I'm doing is I'll buy the DLC, but that's it.

56:08.000 --> 56:12.480
I mean, I'm not going to upgrade, which is yeah, which is fine.

56:13.480 --> 56:16.280
I'll do it if the person who manages our family plan does it.

56:16.800 --> 56:23.600
And the other thing with all this, too, is that, you know, PlayStation Plus, Xbox Gold are

56:23.600 --> 56:25.440
ten dollars more a year.

56:25.680 --> 56:30.960
And what Xbox Gold gives four free games a month, PlayStation Plus two, at least three.

56:30.960 --> 56:33.480
And again, like you said, the sixty dollar games are being included with that.

56:33.680 --> 56:36.480
And Nintendo's response is to give fucking happy home designer.

56:36.800 --> 56:37.800
Sorry, Jamie.

56:37.800 --> 56:42.160
But, you know, it's just it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's

56:42.160 --> 56:44.560
you know, it's not enough for that.

56:45.000 --> 56:47.080
It's not enough for that type of fee.

56:47.200 --> 56:49.560
And the 90s hang court right out regardless.

56:49.800 --> 56:54.720
What if like like God forbid, like I know Animal Crossing is a popular game, but not

56:54.720 --> 56:57.600
every single person that has a switch has Animal Crossing.

56:57.840 --> 57:01.440
So let's just say like you don't play Animal Crossing because that's just not your cup

57:01.440 --> 57:04.000
of tea. Maybe you're more of a smash player or something like that.

57:04.360 --> 57:08.440
What is really like so you're really not getting a value proposition with that because

57:08.440 --> 57:09.920
it's like, well, you know.

57:11.120 --> 57:15.600
I still I'm not really getting anything I'm getting DLC, so hopefully they'll want me

57:15.600 --> 57:20.720
to buy the game now so I can play with this DLC like I just don't I don't know, it's

57:20.720 --> 57:26.160
such a tough sell because it's more than double the current price for Nintendo 64 games.

57:26.200 --> 57:28.800
I'm sorry that like we've played them to death.

57:28.800 --> 57:29.880
We've played them so many times.

57:29.880 --> 57:33.120
We've bought them so many times through the Wii shops and stuff like that.

57:33.400 --> 57:38.360
Like. Why can't I play my old games they purchase, you know, like I can still play old

57:38.360 --> 57:43.880
Xbox 360, Xbox Live arcade games if they're supported on the Xbox one, I can still play

57:43.880 --> 57:48.920
a lot of those. Like I just it's so stupid that you have to keep rebutting your stuff.

57:50.960 --> 57:56.840
At the end of the day, Nintendo's counting on the hardcore to fund them, and I think

57:56.840 --> 57:57.760
that's how it's going to go.

57:58.400 --> 58:03.720
And I'm I'm going to just beg everybody to really ask yourself if this is worth it.

58:03.720 --> 58:10.160
And look, I can understand that, yes, Mario Kart 64 online and Sin and Punishment and

58:10.160 --> 58:11.960
all that is going to be worth it to some people.

58:11.960 --> 58:16.520
If that's you go off, nobody nobody but you should get to dictate how your money is

58:16.520 --> 58:21.960
spent. But for me, I'm very disappointed in this as a Nintendo fan and somebody who

58:21.960 --> 58:24.360
usually defends them on this program.

58:24.360 --> 58:28.200
I think it's so interesting because after that last direct, I was so hyped.

58:28.200 --> 58:30.200
I'm like, that's the best direct Nintendo's ever done.

58:30.200 --> 58:33.200
I'm so hyped. And then this happens and I'm like, wow.

58:33.800 --> 58:36.480
Not to go back to Dead by Daylight, but I'm going to.

58:36.480 --> 58:40.720
And you know that opening movie where Dwight's running down the stairs and then he

58:40.720 --> 58:43.640
trips on the stair and eat shit and then pinhead chains him to the wall.

58:43.840 --> 58:46.080
That is how I'm feeling about Nintendo right now.

58:46.080 --> 58:51.600
And here's the ironic thing about this whole thing is if they had just done this instead

58:51.600 --> 58:56.120
of a subscription model like they're doing now and just opened up an e-shop where we

58:56.120 --> 59:00.000
could just purchase these piecemeal, they would probably make more money than they're

59:00.000 --> 59:01.720
going to make off of these subscriptions.

59:02.440 --> 59:06.280
Like it's funny, it's funny, and I already know Bobby's typing this comment in chat and

59:06.280 --> 59:09.960
probably some other people, too, is that when when it was like that, then everybody asked

59:09.960 --> 59:11.360
them to be the Netflix of gaming.

59:11.600 --> 59:17.880
Here's here's the problem is that everybody's looking at it and now going Nintendo, you

59:17.880 --> 59:21.960
have this gigantic fucking catalog and you're piecemealing it like this.

59:21.960 --> 59:25.880
When people wanted Netflix for games, they didn't want.

59:25.880 --> 59:35.000
These like small, they wanted your whole catalog, they want the game pass and that's

59:35.000 --> 59:35.680
that's what they wanted.

59:35.680 --> 59:38.920
But then now that tells like, well, yeah, we could do that, but it's going to be fifty

59:38.920 --> 59:40.120
dollars a year.

59:41.440 --> 59:45.520
Which I think if they brought it down by month and like it may not be such a big deal,

59:45.520 --> 59:51.760
but like it's still I don't know, it's just it's still very clunky, it's it really should

59:51.760 --> 59:57.600
all be like like I shouldn't have to have separate apps for Nintendo, Super Nintendo,

59:57.600 --> 59:59.360
Genesis, Nintendo 64.

59:59.440 --> 01:00:02.400
It should just be one giant like collection.

01:00:02.800 --> 01:00:04.120
That's how they should really do it.

01:00:04.120 --> 01:00:08.760
And it should be also just like why isn't there Game Boy games yet?

01:00:08.800 --> 01:00:13.280
Why isn't there like, you know, stuff that we know that they could like Game Boy, Game

01:00:13.280 --> 01:00:16.360
Boy Advance, like they could do all this stuff easy.

01:00:16.560 --> 01:00:18.440
It's the 3DS could do it.

01:00:18.440 --> 01:00:19.240
Come on.

01:00:19.240 --> 01:00:21.040
Like that's easy stuff.

01:00:21.040 --> 01:00:22.720
Just put it out in there.

01:00:22.720 --> 01:00:23.440
I don't.

01:00:24.560 --> 01:00:26.280
That's probably next year, I guess.

01:00:26.800 --> 01:00:31.840
Pixel Pacas in chat says, I love N64 and still have a console plus games, but still wanted

01:00:31.840 --> 01:00:35.760
to opt into this for very quick and easy access to key N64 games.

01:00:36.040 --> 01:00:38.920
But I won't be upgrading my online membership at this price point.

01:00:39.320 --> 01:00:41.920
ZenMonkey11 in chat says Nintendo knows what they're doing.

01:00:41.920 --> 01:00:43.800
They like to do things right and thorough.

01:00:44.160 --> 01:00:47.720
All I'm going to say is that the Wii U called and said hello.

01:00:47.720 --> 01:00:49.840
The Wii Vitality sensor called and said hello.

01:00:50.160 --> 01:00:54.360
Look, Nintendo is the best game maker in the business that I'm not never going to argue

01:00:54.360 --> 01:00:57.240
that point, but they don't always make winning decisions.

01:00:57.240 --> 01:00:58.720
And in my opinion, this is one of them.

01:00:58.720 --> 01:01:00.280
That's not a winning decision.

01:01:00.280 --> 01:01:01.240
And that's my opinion.

01:01:02.720 --> 01:01:05.200
Here's one of the thing that I want to say on this whole thing before we get to the next

01:01:05.200 --> 01:01:08.680
story, and that is that whole and I'm sure you guys have seen this, that whole, quote

01:01:08.680 --> 01:01:09.480
unquote, rumor.

01:01:09.480 --> 01:01:13.440
But it comes from that source that's gotten a lot of Nintendo things right before.

01:01:13.600 --> 01:01:15.560
So Nintendo is more apt to believe her.

01:01:15.720 --> 01:01:21.560
And the whole thing that it's apparently the third party licensing that is driving this

01:01:21.560 --> 01:01:22.560
cost so high.

01:01:22.560 --> 01:01:26.640
So namely, Sega Genesis is what's driving this cost so high.

01:01:26.800 --> 01:01:28.440
And I'm sitting here going.

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:36.480
That that is that makes a bad thing even worse, they paid that much for Sega Genesis

01:01:36.480 --> 01:01:39.600
stuff, and I'm not knocking the Genesis.

01:01:39.800 --> 01:01:41.160
It's an important console.

01:01:41.160 --> 01:01:42.160
It's a great thing.

01:01:42.880 --> 01:01:44.320
It's everywhere else.

01:01:45.960 --> 01:01:50.960
Except the Wii U, which this rumor said Sega didn't play up on the Wii U because they

01:01:50.960 --> 01:01:55.960
were disappointed in what little sales there were on the Wii and that it wasn't really

01:01:55.960 --> 01:01:57.800
advertised and backed very well.

01:01:58.040 --> 01:02:02.880
But I'm sorry, we all know of that Genesis collection that's available on every other

01:02:02.880 --> 01:02:03.560
platform.

01:02:03.680 --> 01:02:09.080
We know that Sega has no problem releasing their back catalog on like Steam and all

01:02:09.080 --> 01:02:10.280
sorts of other places.

01:02:10.440 --> 01:02:12.840
Those games, very easy to come by.

01:02:12.920 --> 01:02:16.880
I mean, I guess you could even Castlevania Bloodlines was in that Castlevania collection.

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:18.120
They just did not that long ago.

01:02:18.120 --> 01:02:18.960
What's what's left?

01:02:19.080 --> 01:02:20.000
Contra hardcore?

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:21.440
That was in the Contra collection.

01:02:21.560 --> 01:02:22.280
What's left?

01:02:22.640 --> 01:02:28.200
Like there's maybe one or two Genesis games in there that aren't really easily accessible

01:02:28.200 --> 01:02:28.800
somewhere else.

01:02:29.240 --> 01:02:35.280
And so whoever if that is true and it's a big if and I understand this person's gotten

01:02:35.280 --> 01:02:37.760
a lot right before, but I bet they've gotten along wrong, too.

01:02:37.760 --> 01:02:45.200
If this is true, that was that was the worst call in the whole thing.

01:02:45.960 --> 01:02:51.360
Who thought that was a good idea to drive the cost up that high to get the Sega fucking

01:02:51.360 --> 01:02:56.560
Genesis on the Switch when it is literally everywhere else?

01:02:57.240 --> 01:02:58.960
They could have polled people, too.

01:02:58.960 --> 01:03:00.400
I mean, there also is that.

01:03:03.360 --> 01:03:07.160
Yeah, I guess I but again, I don't understand why that and why not.

01:03:07.360 --> 01:03:08.280
Oh, I don't know.

01:03:08.480 --> 01:03:12.400
Do a Gameboy color that has the Pokemon games in it.

01:03:12.640 --> 01:03:17.480
Jesus, that that a lot like if it's just like all the old school Pokemon games.

01:03:18.200 --> 01:03:18.880
Oh, my God.

01:03:18.880 --> 01:03:21.840
People would people would have paid the higher fee for just that.

01:03:24.600 --> 01:03:28.720
Shane, no, I'm just kidding, other people, especially if it had the Pokemon bank

01:03:28.720 --> 01:03:30.240
functionality, you know.

01:03:32.400 --> 01:03:35.000
Johnny Woo face says would rather had GameCube over Genesis.

01:03:35.520 --> 01:03:38.720
As you know, Matt says there are like 10 different Sega collections with those games

01:03:38.720 --> 01:03:39.880
out there. Exactly.

01:03:40.080 --> 01:03:42.200
So, again, that is a rumor.

01:03:42.200 --> 01:03:46.840
I don't want to say like that is the way it is, but it's coming from a source that's been

01:03:46.840 --> 01:03:49.160
right before. So people are really paying attention to it.

01:03:50.120 --> 01:03:55.840
And as I say, if that is true, somebody at Nintendo should be having their job examined

01:03:55.840 --> 01:04:00.080
this week. Quite frankly, that that was the worst business decision somebody could have

01:04:00.080 --> 01:04:06.560
possibly made that it shows a complete lack of awareness of what is happening in the

01:04:06.560 --> 01:04:13.200
industry. If you're Sega, somebody should get a promotion over at Sega for making that

01:04:13.200 --> 01:04:16.880
deal. So because you fucking took him to the cleaners.

01:04:16.920 --> 01:04:23.880
Good job. Once again, Sega ahead of the curve and ahead of its time.

01:04:25.520 --> 01:04:27.920
All right, let's move on.

01:04:30.320 --> 01:04:33.640
Mike Deff says a co-host of mine said they should have just bought Saturn games since a

01:04:33.640 --> 01:04:35.320
lot of people miss those. Yes.

01:04:35.480 --> 01:04:39.960
Yeah. Or if it had been the Dreamcast, can you fucking imagine people would have lost

01:04:39.960 --> 01:04:45.360
their shit? So if if that's the long term plan with Sega.

01:04:46.640 --> 01:04:51.240
Then I will eat my words and I'm not going to say I'm going to eat my hat or something

01:04:51.240 --> 01:04:55.800
because I'll have to chow down on it eventually, possibly, but I will eat my words and

01:04:55.800 --> 01:04:57.160
pony up for one of these subscriptions.

01:04:57.200 --> 01:05:03.000
Absolutely. If that's the long term plan, then that person at Nintendo can keep their

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:04.600
job because that's a very smart plan.

01:05:04.800 --> 01:05:07.600
But if Genesis is the only thing that was in the plan, that was stupid.

01:05:07.960 --> 01:05:13.280
But if the plan involves Dreamcast in six months time or something, Saturn, then OK,

01:05:13.320 --> 01:05:14.400
good job. You did it.

01:05:14.640 --> 01:05:18.120
You did the thing. You probably should have dropped a hint around now to get people more

01:05:18.120 --> 01:05:19.800
excited. But whatever, whatever.

01:05:20.560 --> 01:05:22.920
All right, let's move on. We're running behind us.

01:05:22.920 --> 01:05:25.120
It is. So I want to get to the next story, which is Loki's.

01:05:26.120 --> 01:05:29.720
So we talked about how there's been all these rumors about the Grand Theft Auto trilogy.

01:05:29.760 --> 01:05:33.840
Well, it's even more I mean, they've officially announced that it is coming, but we still

01:05:33.840 --> 01:05:35.920
don't know exactly what exactly it is.

01:05:36.120 --> 01:05:42.480
However, there's been things found on Deep Within Rockstar's website that kind of it's a

01:05:42.480 --> 01:05:46.680
description of it. So they basically said three iconic cities, three epic stories.

01:05:46.880 --> 01:05:53.040
It's going to have the higher resolution textures increase, draw distance, environmental

01:05:53.080 --> 01:05:59.600
upgrades, Grand Theft Auto five style controls and targeting, which is definitely a huge

01:05:59.680 --> 01:06:03.520
upgrade from what was available on the PlayStation one eras.

01:06:04.880 --> 01:06:07.840
All right. Yeah, back when those games originally came out.

01:06:09.560 --> 01:06:11.160
So it sounds interesting.

01:06:11.160 --> 01:06:16.760
I don't know necessarily when it's coming out yet, but apparently there's going to be

01:06:16.760 --> 01:06:20.240
some sort of ten dollar discount or something.

01:06:20.240 --> 01:06:24.440
If you buy it, you get a discount on other rockstar games or something like that.

01:06:24.760 --> 01:06:29.200
So probably later on this year, we'll have to see what exactly it is.

01:06:29.840 --> 01:06:32.160
I'm keeping my expectations low, though.

01:06:34.520 --> 01:06:36.000
As the Grand Theft Auto fan.

01:06:37.640 --> 01:06:38.880
Yeah, well.

01:06:40.240 --> 01:06:44.080
I don't know, I played those so many times, though, I played San Andreas and three and

01:06:44.080 --> 01:06:45.680
Vice City so many times.

01:06:45.680 --> 01:06:48.840
I get it, I get it, but it's just like I can't imagine.

01:06:49.840 --> 01:06:52.960
It's going to be that great, but whatever, we'll check it out.

01:06:54.080 --> 01:06:58.840
All right, speaking of things I can't imagine are going to be that great, let's talk about

01:06:58.840 --> 01:07:01.240
the return of G4 to television.

01:07:01.480 --> 01:07:08.440
So finally, after all this time, we have found out that G4 will be returning to cable

01:07:08.440 --> 01:07:13.040
television. It is not as I thought it was going to be something that was going to be

01:07:13.040 --> 01:07:16.400
leveraged for the Peacock service, which would have made a lot of sense.

01:07:16.640 --> 01:07:18.480
But they are going back to traditional cable.

01:07:18.480 --> 01:07:19.840
So, hey, I mean, congrats.

01:07:19.840 --> 01:07:26.600
That's a win. It is going to launch November 16th on Xfinity TV, Cox and Verizon Fios.

01:07:27.280 --> 01:07:31.560
So that's interesting. You can also stream the network on Filo as well.

01:07:32.400 --> 01:07:36.560
G4 has supposedly made some type of promotional and commercial deal with Twitch.

01:07:37.040 --> 01:07:40.200
I'm assuming that means you're going to see a lot of G4 ads as the pre-roll into other

01:07:40.200 --> 01:07:45.560
content. And G4 will continue to make dedicated social content for social media

01:07:45.560 --> 01:07:48.600
channels that will include YouTube as well.

01:07:48.760 --> 01:07:52.160
So they put out a whole little teaser this week that finally showed the date.

01:07:52.880 --> 01:07:55.160
Attack of the Show and X-Play are returning.

01:07:55.160 --> 01:07:59.320
Kevin Pereira and Adam Sessler are going to be hosting those respective shows.

01:07:59.800 --> 01:08:02.600
No words on other hosts and their involvement right now.

01:08:04.160 --> 01:08:06.360
ESL Esports events will be there as well.

01:08:06.920 --> 01:08:11.720
Dungeons and Dragons playthrough with G4 talent and other celebs, I guess, will be

01:08:11.720 --> 01:08:16.840
there, too. And oh, boy, all 167 episodes of Ninja Warrior for those.

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:23.080
So this is very much late G4 coming back and not early G4 that many of us liked.

01:08:23.720 --> 01:08:25.440
I'll just get XAV instead.

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:26.760
Is it too late?

01:08:28.200 --> 01:08:32.760
Some of the other talent coming to G4, Alex Goldenboy Mendez.

01:08:33.880 --> 01:08:36.640
Avilimay, I've never heard of any of these people.

01:08:37.160 --> 01:08:42.040
Indiana Froskrin Black, YouTube creators Kasim G.

01:08:42.040 --> 01:08:45.920
Gerard, The Completionist Khalil and Gina Darling.

01:08:46.400 --> 01:08:52.880
Twitch streamers Fiona Nova and Will Neff and WWE Xavier Woods, aka Austin Creed.

01:08:52.880 --> 01:08:53.920
OK, I've heard of that one.

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:56.200
The rest I've heard of the wrestler.

01:08:56.200 --> 01:08:59.960
I can't fucking believe we're here at this point, but OK, I guess this is where I'm

01:08:59.960 --> 01:09:03.360
just old, out of touch grandpa of Bahmani Boomer.

01:09:03.360 --> 01:09:05.080
I forgot we all got titles last week.

01:09:05.280 --> 01:09:10.080
Old, out of touch Bahmani Boomer, who doesn't know any of these other new names.

01:09:10.440 --> 01:09:13.440
So anyway, G4 is coming back.

01:09:14.280 --> 01:09:17.240
Anyone have anything to say, anything to say about that?

01:09:19.200 --> 01:09:20.520
I'll wave a little flag.

01:09:21.960 --> 01:09:27.040
I'm going to surprise that they don't go like I get it because it's a cable, like a

01:09:27.040 --> 01:09:30.200
cable channel and they want you to subscribe to it, which I won't be doing.

01:09:31.200 --> 01:09:36.200
But I am kind of disappointed that they're not within this century and streaming online

01:09:36.200 --> 01:09:39.880
as well, like on like Twitch or something like that.

01:09:40.320 --> 01:09:43.160
But whatever, I guess.

01:09:45.320 --> 01:09:47.920
Let's see, Mike Deft says, I do follow The Completionist.

01:09:47.920 --> 01:09:49.160
Good guy. All right. I trust you.

01:09:49.160 --> 01:09:50.360
I trust your feedback, Mike Deft.

01:09:51.080 --> 01:09:53.160
Let's see. Critical Myth says, this sounds terrible.

01:09:53.160 --> 01:09:58.800
Yeah, I mean, I will continue to not watch it like every other cable network.

01:09:58.800 --> 01:10:00.120
I don't watch cable TV anymore.

01:10:00.200 --> 01:10:03.560
This little thing called Twitch came along and I can watch my friends play video games

01:10:03.560 --> 01:10:05.760
and talk to them and chat and be a little bit social.

01:10:05.760 --> 01:10:07.440
And that's kind of what I do.

01:10:07.560 --> 01:10:10.000
And in my opinion, that's G4's biggest competitor.

01:10:10.120 --> 01:10:12.680
So I guess they're smart to team up with Twitch a little bit.

01:10:12.680 --> 01:10:17.480
But yeah, Bobby Black Wolf says, but are they streaming like they're on traditional

01:10:17.480 --> 01:10:18.760
cable in a streaming service?

01:10:18.960 --> 01:10:20.600
It's just not a streaming service you have.

01:10:20.600 --> 01:10:22.120
It's on that Phylos or whatever.

01:10:22.120 --> 01:10:23.800
So cool.

01:10:23.800 --> 01:10:27.720
Yeah, Phylo you can do like through like smart TV and stuff.

01:10:27.720 --> 01:10:32.600
I've watched a little bit of the Hell's Kitchen uncensored channel.

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:35.680
I watched a lot of the RuPaul's Drag Race channel and that was a thing.

01:10:35.680 --> 01:10:36.640
But they got rid of that.

01:10:36.880 --> 01:10:39.800
And then I watched some of the Survivor channel that shows that the old ass episode

01:10:39.800 --> 01:10:41.160
survivor on Pluto TV.

01:10:41.400 --> 01:10:45.280
That's about that's about the most channel stuff I've watched on those free streaming

01:10:45.280 --> 01:10:47.040
services. Oh, I take that back.

01:10:47.600 --> 01:10:52.000
My TV has something built into it.

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:53.720
What's Samsung's streaming service?

01:10:53.920 --> 01:10:56.800
The Samsung TVs have something built into it and they have a game show channel.

01:10:56.800 --> 01:10:57.800
And I do watch that.

01:10:58.520 --> 01:11:00.560
I forgot about that. So I will I'll give you that.

01:11:01.160 --> 01:11:04.480
Pluto's fun when they've got because they have the dedicated Mr.

01:11:04.480 --> 01:11:06.880
Sans here, three thousand channels, which are always fun.

01:11:09.080 --> 01:11:11.640
OK, Mike Deff says smart TV, I have it too, so.

01:11:11.640 --> 01:11:14.560
All right. Anyway, let's move on.

01:11:14.560 --> 01:11:16.520
I think we're to Dark Sakura.

01:11:17.440 --> 01:11:26.720
Are we? Well, you know, I am a big fan of of the analog company and a lot of the

01:11:27.040 --> 01:11:30.840
things that they put out and I really do want one of these just they're expensive.

01:11:31.920 --> 01:11:36.800
The analog pocket that's supposed to play all these delightful things.

01:11:37.640 --> 01:11:42.440
It's getting its own operating system when it launches and it is going to launch later

01:11:42.440 --> 01:11:48.880
this year. Now, tell me when the freakin' analog duo is coming up, because that's what

01:11:48.880 --> 01:11:50.960
I want more. Anyway.

01:11:51.640 --> 01:12:01.160
They are going to come out with analog OS, which they call, quote, a definitive

01:12:01.160 --> 01:12:07.840
scholarly operating system that lets users explore, discover and play through all of

01:12:07.840 --> 01:12:09.120
video game history.

01:12:09.760 --> 01:12:16.520
It is a fairly minimalist operating system to which I'm rather pleased about, but it

01:12:16.520 --> 01:12:23.240
has its library that has a database that was built by the group at Analog that shows

01:12:23.240 --> 01:12:28.920
a system by system, game by game, region by region, developer by developer, publisher

01:12:28.920 --> 01:12:36.000
by publisher, revision by revision, a complete and total history of video games.

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:43.680
And that, I have to say, it's it's gorgeous.

01:12:44.400 --> 01:12:49.440
I like it. And on top of that, I mean, some of the other things, too, is that you can

01:12:49.440 --> 01:12:53.960
organize your your games and create gaming playlists.

01:12:55.920 --> 01:12:58.440
That and you can share your playlist with other people.

01:12:59.440 --> 01:13:05.760
And you can track when you play, it's got like all kinds of other other interesting

01:13:05.760 --> 01:13:17.360
tools in it with a nice OLED display, but that the OS is it looks really, really beautiful.

01:13:17.640 --> 01:13:25.480
You know me, I like something that's clean looking that that's just simple and easy to

01:13:25.960 --> 01:13:31.840
pick up. But the fact that it's got so much gaming history attached to it is honestly

01:13:31.840 --> 01:13:34.600
it's what I really, really am excited for.

01:13:35.320 --> 01:13:38.400
I, I more and more want one of these things.

01:13:40.760 --> 01:13:47.240
Plus, it has dark mode and you have like classic screen modes and all kinds of different

01:13:47.240 --> 01:13:51.360
features for the different systems that are portrayed in the gaming.

01:13:51.360 --> 01:13:54.960
And I'm absolutely delighted by this.

01:13:57.080 --> 01:14:01.480
Yeah, it looks really neat, like I kind of want to get one of these, too, just because it

01:14:01.480 --> 01:14:03.520
looks like such a great way to kind of play the old games.

01:14:03.760 --> 01:14:08.280
They have a very strong kind of like anti ROM stance, too, like they're very much like

01:14:08.280 --> 01:14:10.200
this is for cartridges, not for ROM.

01:14:10.200 --> 01:14:15.160
Well, I think they're just saying that the the they're just trying to clarify that the OS

01:14:15.160 --> 01:14:16.920
is not allowing you to pirate stuff.

01:14:17.480 --> 01:14:20.520
The system is meant to be like a physical, you know.

01:14:22.080 --> 01:14:25.880
Physical game device, but like the fact that it plays HuCards.

01:14:27.400 --> 01:14:30.000
And I think it plays both varieties of HuCards.

01:14:31.320 --> 01:14:34.880
I mean, my Turbo Express is kind of beat.

01:14:35.120 --> 01:14:38.480
It would be nice to to have something like this.

01:14:38.680 --> 01:14:42.800
Yeah. Plus, you could always get like a never drive or something like that if you

01:14:42.800 --> 01:14:44.280
wanted to load your own ROMs and.

01:14:45.120 --> 01:14:46.520
Yeah.

01:14:47.480 --> 01:14:50.960
All right, well, moving on a few more stories here before we get to the classic game of

01:14:50.960 --> 01:14:51.880
the week, but first.

01:14:53.120 --> 01:14:53.520
Loki.

01:14:55.400 --> 01:15:01.760
So Epic has finally admitted what we've already all known since the absolute beginning of

01:15:01.760 --> 01:15:09.720
time that, yes, Fortnite's imposter mode might have been inspired by Among Us.

01:15:09.720 --> 01:15:12.880
It may have been, you know, a little bit.

01:15:14.280 --> 01:15:21.760
So, yeah, basically said that, you know, in their, I guess, update notes or whatever,

01:15:21.760 --> 01:15:28.480
they said, you know, version 18.20 brings improvements to imposters, the game mode

01:15:28.480 --> 01:15:31.240
inspired by Among Us from Intersloth.

01:15:32.360 --> 01:15:35.400
So they do mention that, you know, they finally do credit them.

01:15:35.760 --> 01:15:40.160
Of course, you know, Intersloth said, you know, hey, we didn't really necessarily we

01:15:40.160 --> 01:15:44.160
didn't patent the mechanics for Among Us because they don't think it's healthy for the

01:15:44.160 --> 01:15:45.640
game industry to do that.

01:15:46.960 --> 01:15:51.280
And I think the thought is that there's going to be some sort of maybe crossover between

01:15:51.280 --> 01:15:55.800
Among Us and Fortnite that they're going to do something with that maybe.

01:15:55.840 --> 01:15:59.600
And that's why now they're kind of shaking hands and, you know.

01:16:01.080 --> 01:16:06.720
So among us team, don't sell out, don't do it, don't.

01:16:08.560 --> 01:16:13.360
So we'll see, but thank you, Epic, for doing the bare minimum.

01:16:15.160 --> 01:16:18.720
I think you're right, right, though, that it could be leading to something bigger, but

01:16:18.720 --> 01:16:19.200
we'll see.

01:16:19.920 --> 01:16:20.360
All right.

01:16:20.360 --> 01:16:21.840
I mean, yeah, it's.

01:16:24.840 --> 01:16:29.040
Well, moving on to before we get to the classic game of the week, obviously, a lot of

01:16:29.040 --> 01:16:34.920
people loving Metroid Dread, but don't run into the bug that is in the game that apparently

01:16:34.920 --> 01:16:39.120
is really screwing people up on being able to finish the game because the title will

01:16:39.120 --> 01:16:43.040
close out and causes an error that says the software was closed because an error

01:16:43.080 --> 01:16:48.600
occurred. Apparently, if you destroy a door while a map marker for that door is displayed

01:16:48.600 --> 01:16:51.640
on the map, it will crash the game, which seems a little silly.

01:16:52.160 --> 01:16:58.320
Nintendo says if you just restart and before this happens, take off the icon door map

01:16:58.320 --> 01:17:01.640
marker and then the error won't occur and the game can continue.

01:17:02.280 --> 01:17:03.920
So that seems easy enough to avoid.

01:17:03.920 --> 01:17:06.520
But Nintendo will be patching the game.

01:17:06.880 --> 01:17:10.560
You don't often hear about Nintendo having to do bug fix patches because they come from

01:17:10.560 --> 01:17:12.160
an era when you couldn't do that.

01:17:12.400 --> 01:17:14.720
So but that they're doing it.

01:17:14.720 --> 01:17:16.120
So they're going to it isn't the first time.

01:17:16.120 --> 01:17:19.680
Obviously, we just talked about an Animal Crossing patch, so they're going to fix this

01:17:19.680 --> 01:17:23.800
with a patch. And I think it's supposed to be a little later this month.

01:17:23.800 --> 01:17:26.000
I think I was hearing is when they were planning to put that out.

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:29.120
So that'll be good for people trying to get past that.

01:17:29.120 --> 01:17:35.760
But it is very interesting that the game launched with a bug kind of like that, that left

01:17:35.760 --> 01:17:38.680
some folks getting their games restarted on them, which would have.

01:17:38.680 --> 01:17:43.960
It would have made me unhappy if I ran into that, I guess I still could, but I haven't

01:17:43.960 --> 01:17:46.280
really been using map markers, so I probably won't.

01:17:47.200 --> 01:17:51.120
All right, I'm going to our chat before we get to our next segment.

01:17:51.360 --> 01:17:54.280
Zen Monkey in chat says the Among Us team already sold out.

01:17:54.280 --> 01:17:58.680
They promised an Among Us 2 and Among Us 1 going totally free and open source.

01:17:58.880 --> 01:18:01.000
Then they saw how popular the first one got.

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:03.320
So they saw dollar signs and changed their roadmap.

01:18:03.840 --> 01:18:10.360
Um, I kind of see that, but at the same time, there's a part of me that thinks that sort of

01:18:10.360 --> 01:18:12.320
success, they they kind of earned it.

01:18:12.320 --> 01:18:14.280
They made a cultural phenomenon type of thing.

01:18:14.440 --> 01:18:17.320
I get the hold they were going to make it open source and then they didn't.

01:18:17.320 --> 01:18:19.280
Kind of seems as them going back on their word.

01:18:19.600 --> 01:18:25.080
I would guess one day this game will lose its popularity and steam and all that stuff.

01:18:25.360 --> 01:18:29.240
And they'll probably come around and release the source code like they did with Doom, like

01:18:29.400 --> 01:18:34.880
all the stuff to probably like depending on the success of it, because obviously like a

01:18:34.880 --> 01:18:38.280
smaller game or something like that, they probably have no problem with like, they're

01:18:38.280 --> 01:18:40.160
like, OK, well, we released it.

01:18:40.680 --> 01:18:42.080
All right. Didn't really do that.

01:18:42.080 --> 01:18:45.120
Great. OK, we'll go ahead and release the source code because why not?

01:18:45.120 --> 01:18:47.720
We'll move on from there. And then it became a huge phenomenon.

01:18:47.720 --> 01:18:51.400
They're like. All right, well, now we have to go a different approach.

01:18:51.400 --> 01:18:52.480
I could see that.

01:18:52.720 --> 01:18:54.920
Yeah, people can change their minds.

01:18:55.920 --> 01:18:59.440
And Mike Deaf says, who's buying their official Among Us costume for Halloween?

01:19:00.440 --> 01:19:05.240
I don't think they did not have any Among Us Halloween costumes when I went.

01:19:05.240 --> 01:19:07.000
I haven't seen it, but I'm sure it's out there.

01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:13.240
Now, if you want Fortnite costumes, well, there's a whole section in the store for Fortnite.

01:19:14.680 --> 01:19:16.920
All right. Can I be sexy Fortnite?

01:19:17.880 --> 01:19:20.840
Because that's that's a Halloween is it's sexy.

01:19:21.240 --> 01:19:26.160
Probably. I am I'm guessing I mean, ironically, yes, I think you can.

01:19:26.160 --> 01:19:31.600
And I swear that I have seen those like kind of posts where it's showing the stupidest

01:19:31.600 --> 01:19:33.560
like sexy costumes that they have.

01:19:33.560 --> 01:19:39.640
And I'm pretty sure I did see one with like the llama pinata thing as like a sexy costume.

01:19:39.640 --> 01:19:44.520
So it was just like it's blue and purple bikinis and a llama head.

01:19:44.520 --> 01:19:45.640
It makes no sense.

01:19:46.600 --> 01:19:49.480
E3 Vielenchat says squid game costume this year.

01:19:49.480 --> 01:19:53.240
But that's a sexy did not have those sexy squid game.

01:19:53.240 --> 01:19:58.960
I'm into it. It's too soon for like the Halloween store chains to actually have those

01:19:58.960 --> 01:20:01.200
because they manufacture the stuff way in advance.

01:20:02.200 --> 01:20:05.120
So they did not get in on the squid game stuff this year.

01:20:05.120 --> 01:20:07.960
Now, Amazon and all the other like shops online.

01:20:08.160 --> 01:20:09.360
Yeah, of course, you can do that.

01:20:10.360 --> 01:20:13.960
I'm going to do that. I'm going to do that in Rocky for Rocky in two weeks.

01:20:13.960 --> 01:20:15.400
I'm going to do sexy squid game.

01:20:17.480 --> 01:20:19.080
I can't wait. All right.

01:20:19.560 --> 01:20:21.400
Anyhow, let's move on.

01:20:21.400 --> 01:20:24.160
Are you are you going to dress up like the doll?

01:20:24.160 --> 01:20:25.400
I already know. I already know how to.

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:27.200
I could dress up as the doll.

01:20:27.200 --> 01:20:28.680
That's one way to do it. But I think what to do.

01:20:28.680 --> 01:20:34.000
I'll wear for the top up like a tank top with the number like on it in green and then the

01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:38.600
bottom. I'm just going to have like probably I'll just wear like green undies that come up

01:20:38.600 --> 01:20:43.400
pretty high. Like it's you know, I'm willing to wear it on the Rocky stage, but not much

01:20:43.400 --> 01:20:46.360
beyond that, that and then like green fishnets and green heels.

01:20:47.400 --> 01:20:49.360
That's that's my idea for sexy squid game.

01:20:49.560 --> 01:20:54.520
So and then then what I'll do is I'll actually like I'll have a squid for one of my arms and

01:20:54.520 --> 01:20:56.760
I'll make jokes about the tentacles.

01:20:56.760 --> 01:20:57.800
Anyway. All right.

01:20:58.720 --> 01:21:01.480
Tyre class says, what if you dress up as the squid kids from Splatoon?

01:21:01.680 --> 01:21:05.920
I don't want to bring things for kids into these costume crazy costume ideas I have.

01:21:06.040 --> 01:21:07.960
So pass pretty.

01:21:07.960 --> 01:21:13.240
Yeah. Bonds 006 says, Rob, my girlfriend asked if you will do sexy squid game costume on

01:21:13.240 --> 01:21:18.240
the podcast. Oh, this this is where we I should I should hold it hostage for money.

01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:20.680
We'll see. We'll see what kind of mood I mean.

01:21:20.800 --> 01:21:24.480
Here's the thing. There are rules of what you can and can't do on Twitch.

01:21:24.880 --> 01:21:28.480
So I will probably only be able to do it from the top up on Twitch.

01:21:28.480 --> 01:21:30.040
You can't do that on Twitch a vision.

01:21:30.080 --> 01:21:32.080
Yeah, you can't do that on Twitch a vision.

01:21:33.560 --> 01:21:39.840
All right. Let's move on to a time when things were less sexy for Halloween.

01:21:41.720 --> 01:21:43.640
These are pretty bad and homemade.

01:21:49.240 --> 01:21:58.200
And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time or I'll dive into the vault and pull

01:21:58.200 --> 01:22:00.080
out a classic and tell you about it.

01:22:00.480 --> 01:22:03.200
It's time for the classic game of the week.

01:22:04.640 --> 01:22:08.040
As Joe 100 Matt says, there was a time before sexy Halloween costumes.

01:22:08.040 --> 01:22:11.120
I think so. At least there was a time when this game existed.

01:22:11.120 --> 01:22:13.120
And it's it's not that sexy.

01:22:13.120 --> 01:22:14.960
It's kind of loud. It's older than a lot of you.

01:22:15.040 --> 01:22:17.440
Yes. Darcacro, what is this game that we're looking at?

01:22:18.280 --> 01:22:21.520
The game that I picked is Monaco GP.

01:22:21.920 --> 01:22:23.680
Now I'm going to take a step back.

01:22:23.680 --> 01:22:28.800
A lot of people know Monaco GP as a more modern racer, but not so.

01:22:28.800 --> 01:22:30.920
This is the original Monaco GP.

01:22:33.040 --> 01:22:40.240
It is an arcade racing game that was released by Sega in November 1979 and came out in

01:22:40.240 --> 01:22:42.720
North America, January 1980.

01:22:43.520 --> 01:22:54.760
It has a very specific, special thing about it, and that is that it was the last Sega

01:22:54.760 --> 01:23:04.840
game to use TTL based logic circuits instead of microprocessor based CPUs, transistor to

01:23:04.840 --> 01:23:06.200
transistor logic, by the way.

01:23:06.880 --> 01:23:20.760
It has 100 chips across two circuit boards, sprites and different images are are stored

01:23:20.760 --> 01:23:27.440
on a small ROM chip, and then the sound effects and other things are stored.

01:23:27.920 --> 01:23:32.560
They're actually generated by an operational amplifier and other analog circuitry.

01:23:33.080 --> 01:23:40.840
So the scoring is done via LEDs on the cabinet, kind of old school pinball style,

01:23:41.240 --> 01:23:44.280
including players high scores in the high score table.

01:23:44.560 --> 01:23:50.040
And basically it's a race against the clock.

01:23:50.040 --> 01:23:53.800
You are racing your little cars through five different areas.

01:23:54.560 --> 01:23:57.160
You have rival cars that will get faster.

01:23:57.160 --> 01:23:58.280
The road will narrow.

01:23:58.280 --> 01:24:01.080
The surface changes to ice and gravel.

01:24:02.880 --> 01:24:09.400
There are also for this arcade game, there were multiple cabinets out.

01:24:09.760 --> 01:24:15.520
There was a deluxe cockpit cabinet that you would sit behind the steering wheel.

01:24:15.520 --> 01:24:18.160
We had these a long time ago, y'all.

01:24:19.320 --> 01:24:23.040
And then you also, of course, had the stand up versions.

01:24:23.040 --> 01:24:37.920
But yeah, Monaco GP has had many a port and it really did sort of get that racing genre really big.

01:24:37.920 --> 01:24:44.080
I mean, we also had around the same time, you know, pole positions coming out.

01:24:44.080 --> 01:24:51.840
We had other racing games and this one was among the top three highest grossing

01:24:51.840 --> 01:24:57.160
driving games of 1979 in Japan and the top five in 1980.

01:24:57.520 --> 01:25:02.560
And in America, it was the top grossing driving game of 1981.

01:25:02.560 --> 01:25:05.880
And it still remained in the Japanese charts through 83.

01:25:07.040 --> 01:25:09.440
In the US, it remained in charts through 87.

01:25:09.440 --> 01:25:10.920
So, I mean, look at that.

01:25:10.920 --> 01:25:12.720
It's really, yeah.

01:25:14.240 --> 01:25:18.720
And it's hard to find a good long play of the arcade one.

01:25:18.720 --> 01:25:22.280
I did link another one that has better sound that's from the arcade.

01:25:24.240 --> 01:25:29.400
But to go through it, there was an upgraded version that was pro Monaco GP that came out in 1980.

01:25:29.800 --> 01:25:35.960
And then later on, it was ported to the SG1000 in 1983.

01:25:36.520 --> 01:25:47.200
It also had later releases as a Super Monaco GP and Aiten Senn as a Super Monaco GP 2.

01:25:47.680 --> 01:25:53.200
So, this one as well.

01:25:53.200 --> 01:26:05.600
I mean, like I said, it was very well received and it's been re-released, you know, had sequels and everything.

01:26:05.600 --> 01:26:12.720
But it even had re-released a remake, sorry, for PlayStation 2 and the Sega Aegis 2500 collection.

01:26:13.560 --> 01:26:19.040
And it had a bunch of different add-ons, including more cars and game modes.

01:26:19.520 --> 01:26:28.080
And the remake itself improved some of the gameplay that people were a little bit iffy about on the original.

01:26:28.480 --> 01:26:42.240
So, I mean, there's a person from Replay, Eddie Adium, I'm going to say, I'm going to hope I pronounced it right.

01:26:42.720 --> 01:26:49.800
That said that Monaco GP is one of the, quote, most evergreen games to come out from 1979.

01:26:50.680 --> 01:26:59.000
And I, honestly, there's not really enough I can say about it really.

01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:02.520
It is a fairly obvious, fairly simple game.

01:27:02.520 --> 01:27:06.280
But this is, again, the late 70s when this came out.

01:27:06.920 --> 01:27:12.400
And it was a fairly, I would say, involved game for its time.

01:27:12.600 --> 01:27:16.680
Now, we might call it simple now, but this game really did a lot of stuff.

01:27:16.680 --> 01:27:23.320
And like I said, it was one of the last old school style TTL machines that Sega put out.

01:27:23.320 --> 01:27:24.800
So it does have that distinction.

01:27:26.080 --> 01:27:27.200
But that's it.

01:27:27.480 --> 01:27:29.760
I was going to say, can I tell an interesting story about this game real quick?

01:27:30.200 --> 01:27:31.080
Let me surprise you.

01:27:32.280 --> 01:27:34.680
So I don't know if my dad is still out there watching.

01:27:35.040 --> 01:27:37.760
He texted a picture earlier that he was watching.

01:27:37.760 --> 01:27:40.760
So, hi, dad, if you're out there and thanks for watching tonight.

01:27:41.640 --> 01:27:46.200
But way back in the day, we had a Commodore 64.

01:27:46.200 --> 01:27:49.240
And I've talked about the C64 era a lot on this show.

01:27:49.600 --> 01:27:55.840
And one of the games that my dad found and bought for this Commodore 64 that we had was a game called Le Mans.

01:27:57.160 --> 01:28:05.160
And I remember that game quite fondly as one of the first games I really played when I was younger on that Commodore 64,

01:28:05.160 --> 01:28:09.720
because it used the paddle, used that unique like Atari paddle kind of.

01:28:09.880 --> 01:28:14.400
Actually, no, it was because you could plug the Atari controllers into the Commodore 64.

01:28:14.400 --> 01:28:15.520
I forgot that that was like a thing.

01:28:15.720 --> 01:28:17.560
So you use the paddle controller with it.

01:28:18.040 --> 01:28:19.120
It was this game.

01:28:19.520 --> 01:28:26.520
It was literally the exact same thing as this game down to the nighttime levels were in that as well.

01:28:26.760 --> 01:28:31.440
So like it was very much a clone, a rip off or whatever of this.

01:28:31.760 --> 01:28:36.800
And I never realized, you know, because I just always thought when I saw this type of game, I was like, oh, it's Le Mans.

01:28:37.120 --> 01:28:40.960
And I'm like, oh, my God, it was inspired by this game.

01:28:41.200 --> 01:28:46.120
So it was like a Commodore's clone of Monaco GP, which is so crazy to me.

01:28:46.400 --> 01:28:50.800
So, yeah, one of my first first gaming memories is that game.

01:28:50.960 --> 01:28:53.080
And so essentially it's this.

01:28:53.200 --> 01:28:57.560
And I'm sure the audio, sorry if the audio kind of bugs a little bit, but it is, you know, it's a late 70s game.

01:28:57.560 --> 01:29:02.680
I didn't have a lot of great audio, but the Commodore 64 version was really no better in that regard.

01:29:02.680 --> 01:29:06.360
You know, it was like that constant engine noise you would hear in the game.

01:29:06.360 --> 01:29:13.160
But I think that's just so interesting how it existed in my memory as a different game.

01:29:13.160 --> 01:29:15.720
But that was one that was, in fact, inspired by this.

01:29:17.200 --> 01:29:18.680
So. All right.

01:29:19.480 --> 01:29:20.600
There it is. Excellent choice.

01:29:20.600 --> 01:29:25.440
Dark Sakura, the classic game of the week is Monaco GP by Sega.

01:29:25.440 --> 01:29:28.440
I am glad people approve of my choice.

01:29:28.520 --> 01:29:29.640
Yeah. All right.

01:29:29.960 --> 01:29:31.760
It's older than a lot of you kids.

01:29:31.760 --> 01:29:32.560
Get off my lawn.

01:29:32.560 --> 01:29:33.680
Sure is. It's about as old as I am.

01:29:33.680 --> 01:29:35.640
Get me my pink drink and get off my lawn.

01:29:36.360 --> 01:29:39.560
All right. Let's get into some rapid fire news.

01:29:39.960 --> 01:29:41.480
Let's get to it. Loki.

01:29:42.680 --> 01:29:51.360
Yes, so apparently Epic is thinking that, well, since they have all of the Halloween costumes now, that, hey, why not?

01:29:51.360 --> 01:29:57.920
Let's expand out into scripted video programming, in other words, movies for Fortnite.

01:29:58.360 --> 01:30:05.200
So perhaps we'll see a Fortnite movie or a Fortnite Netflix series or something to that effect.

01:30:05.600 --> 01:30:07.680
But it is something that they are considering.

01:30:08.280 --> 01:30:15.360
And why not? Because it is a pop culture phenomenon and they like money.

01:30:15.800 --> 01:30:17.720
So, of course, they're going to do that.

01:30:18.640 --> 01:30:21.400
So we'll have to wait and see. Fun times.

01:30:22.480 --> 01:30:34.400
And then there's also the word basically with the announcement we had last week of Kingdom Hearts coming to the Switch via cloud versions.

01:30:34.720 --> 01:30:39.720
They were asked if, you know, there is a way to get this to run natively instead of via the cloud service.

01:30:39.720 --> 01:30:45.120
And it's something that they're, you know, not sure they're undecided on trying to pursue.

01:30:45.120 --> 01:30:46.440
But it is, you know.

01:30:48.160 --> 01:30:57.800
It's not going to happen on this hardware, I'm going to tell you that right now, but we'll like to to think that, you know, maybe they'll figure out a way to do it.

01:30:58.880 --> 01:31:00.240
I mean, they did it with The Witcher 3.

01:31:00.240 --> 01:31:02.960
I don't know why they can't do this, but we'll see.

01:31:05.240 --> 01:31:06.680
All right, Dark Sakura.

01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:14.040
So there is a release date now for Gate of Nightmares.

01:31:15.560 --> 01:31:23.360
It is going to be out, it's a JRPG done by Mashima Ahido, who is also behind Fairy Tail.

01:31:24.360 --> 01:31:29.360
It's going to be released on October 26th for iOS and Android.

01:31:30.360 --> 01:31:34.720
And it's looking like it's going to be pretty fun.

01:31:34.720 --> 01:31:37.200
So, yeah, October 26, go get it.

01:31:38.400 --> 01:31:40.200
I think that looks really neat.

01:31:40.200 --> 01:31:41.400
I love that art style, too.

01:31:42.800 --> 01:31:46.920
And sadder news, though, for fans of Rocksmith, of which I know three.

01:31:49.600 --> 01:31:58.480
While Ubisoft is working on Rocksmith Plus, the original Rocksmith from 2011 and all of its DLC

01:31:59.160 --> 01:32:06.720
are being removed from digital stores that is starting on today on the 17th.

01:32:07.080 --> 01:32:10.640
So as of today, it's being pulled and delisted.

01:32:11.760 --> 01:32:16.720
We all know somebody who used to work on Rocksmith, not let's not say them on air, but we all do.

01:32:16.840 --> 01:32:24.240
Yeah, yeah, but I'm talking about the people who actually are good at this and learned to play freaking guitar from it.

01:32:24.400 --> 01:32:25.440
It was my idea.

01:32:26.080 --> 01:32:30.040
Yeah, well, I mean, we're going to have another one, just the old ones going away.

01:32:30.200 --> 01:32:34.120
Right. Out with the old and with the new, I guess.

01:32:34.360 --> 01:32:35.880
Yeah, the old was 10 years old.

01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:37.000
It's fine. Yeah, true.

01:32:37.520 --> 01:32:41.960
It's dated. Like this program.

01:32:43.640 --> 01:32:45.600
Girl. All right.

01:32:46.160 --> 01:32:52.360
Let's travel around the world and check out that hot new current stuff that all the kids are going to be talking about and the release dates from this week.

01:32:52.680 --> 01:32:54.720
Loki, we'll start with you and the U.S. release dates.

01:32:55.520 --> 01:33:02.320
Yes. So this week we have the Caligula Effect 2 on Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4.

01:33:02.920 --> 01:33:06.400
Dying Light Platinum Edition on Nintendo Switch.

01:33:07.120 --> 01:33:14.160
Corpse Party on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One and Xbox Series X.

01:33:15.760 --> 01:33:22.040
Disciples Liberation on PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One and Xbox Series X.

01:33:22.760 --> 01:33:27.320
Echo Generation, which I'm very much looking forward to, this is an awesome looking game.

01:33:27.720 --> 01:33:29.720
Xbox One, Xbox Series X.

01:33:30.880 --> 01:33:33.960
We have Ever Tried on Nintendo Switch.

01:33:35.360 --> 01:33:39.920
Ghaul, the Hero Slayer on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

01:33:40.640 --> 01:33:46.360
Toy Soldiers HD on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

01:33:46.960 --> 01:33:57.400
And last but not least, the Dark Pictures Anthology House of Ashes on PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X.

01:33:58.680 --> 01:34:03.200
I can't believe you'd be leaving out this title I'm looking at for the Nintendo Switch.

01:34:03.200 --> 01:34:05.040
That's definitely Game of the Year material.

01:34:05.280 --> 01:34:08.960
It's my friend, Peppa Pig, is out on the switch this week in the U.S.

01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:09.880
How dare you, Loki?

01:34:10.440 --> 01:34:13.360
It's not on my list, so I'm not sure if it actually is.

01:34:13.920 --> 01:34:14.840
Oh, it's on my list.

01:34:14.840 --> 01:34:15.480
It's lies.

01:34:15.520 --> 01:34:16.760
Somehow on mine.

01:34:16.800 --> 01:34:21.400
All right. Anyway, moving over to Japan and checking out releases over there.

01:34:21.960 --> 01:34:24.520
Blue Reflection, second light on the switch this week.

01:34:24.520 --> 01:34:27.800
And Archetype Arcadia is out this week in Japan.

01:34:28.440 --> 01:34:30.240
That's it really for the Nintendo Switch.

01:34:30.240 --> 01:34:33.080
Taking a look at the PlayStation 5 this week in Japan.

01:34:34.480 --> 01:34:35.960
I don't think we have anything at all.

01:34:37.120 --> 01:34:39.200
Let me take a slow week all over.

01:34:39.200 --> 01:34:42.560
It is all over. I'm just briefly looking at the PlayStation 4.

01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:45.440
That same Blue Reflection, second light, Archetype Arcadia.

01:34:45.440 --> 01:34:47.280
Both those games also on the PlayStation 4.

01:34:47.520 --> 01:34:50.080
But that's really it. Yeah, slow week out there, too.

01:34:50.840 --> 01:34:51.880
Darsakra, how about the UK?

01:34:53.320 --> 01:34:55.840
Only three things, and that's for the 22nd.

01:34:55.880 --> 01:35:00.880
We have the Dark Pictures Triple Pack for PlayStation and Xbox.

01:35:01.480 --> 01:35:03.640
We have my friend, Peppa Pigu.

01:35:03.880 --> 01:35:04.720
I'm sorry, Pig.

01:35:05.760 --> 01:35:08.360
I'm going to Photoshop her into Pig, by the way.

01:35:09.360 --> 01:35:12.560
That's on PlayStation, Xbox and Switch.

01:35:13.040 --> 01:35:17.640
And then on Xbox and PlayStation, again,

01:35:17.640 --> 01:35:20.920
we have the Dark Pictures Anthology, House of Ashes.

01:35:23.280 --> 01:35:24.280
All right.

01:35:25.840 --> 01:35:28.000
That's it for the release date.

01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:29.040
Oh, go ahead.

01:35:29.040 --> 01:35:32.000
For the record, speaking of Pigu, I forgot to mention.

01:35:32.240 --> 01:35:37.160
OK, I got to pick the name for Pig in our friend

01:35:37.400 --> 01:35:39.280
Nick and Princess Nuzlocke thing today.

01:35:40.520 --> 01:35:43.560
And her name is Amanda Lorien.

01:35:43.560 --> 01:35:48.160
I like these cute little things since you brought that up in general talk,

01:35:48.640 --> 01:35:52.880
not just DBD, but obviously you and I watch a lot of the streams we see a lot.

01:35:53.160 --> 01:35:56.600
I like these cute little challenges that streamers come up for themselves with this.

01:35:56.600 --> 01:35:59.320
And I guess this whole Nuzlocke thing is based off a Pokemon concept.

01:35:59.320 --> 01:36:03.440
It is a lot of Pokemon streamers kind of do and started in that whole regard.

01:36:03.680 --> 01:36:06.600
So I like these cute little challenges that people develop

01:36:06.600 --> 01:36:08.800
for themselves on Twitch. I think it's cute.

01:36:08.800 --> 01:36:12.920
So I just like that he's letting everyone pick nicknames, but I actually

01:36:14.240 --> 01:36:17.720
did my sub in such a way that I got to actually just straight out pick a name.

01:36:18.240 --> 01:36:22.360
So so, yeah, so as a result of that, I actually

01:36:23.320 --> 01:36:25.680
I hate seeing photoshopped because I don't use Photoshop anymore.

01:36:25.960 --> 01:36:32.040
I affinity photoed a picture of pig instead of wearing the pig mask.

01:36:32.040 --> 01:36:34.840
She's wearing the Mandalorian helmet. Perfect.

01:36:34.840 --> 01:36:37.840
I'm very proud of my work.

01:36:38.080 --> 01:36:41.400
And then she was instantly eliminated from the Nuzlocke the first game.

01:36:41.440 --> 01:36:42.680
I'm just kidding. No, I didn't.

01:36:42.680 --> 01:36:47.280
I actually actually made it back for the last half of the first game

01:36:47.520 --> 01:36:49.760
because I thought I'd have time to go do my makeup and everything.

01:36:50.040 --> 01:36:53.320
And it was it was a pig who was winner.

01:36:53.840 --> 01:36:56.400
Oh, fun. OK, it was best do.

01:36:57.640 --> 01:37:01.200
Let's move on. We have some more stories for you guys due to the late start tonight.

01:37:01.200 --> 01:37:03.840
I think we're going to kind of pick up the pace with these last few stories here.

01:37:04.520 --> 01:37:06.640
And because I know we have at least two emails tonight

01:37:06.640 --> 01:37:09.120
and I want to see if we can try to squeeze in a call or two.

01:37:09.320 --> 01:37:12.280
But to do that, we're going to go through these stories a little faster than usual.

01:37:12.280 --> 01:37:14.920
It's just, I think, like five stories. So we'll start with Loki.

01:37:15.880 --> 01:37:20.680
Yeah, so Sony's finally letting us buy PlayStation fives directly from them.

01:37:21.160 --> 01:37:22.840
They put up a website to go ahead and do that.

01:37:22.840 --> 01:37:25.800
You have to put your username in there to try to restrict it.

01:37:25.920 --> 01:37:27.800
One per household.

01:37:27.800 --> 01:37:31.440
Also, probably the fact that, you know, a lot of these other bigger chains

01:37:31.640 --> 01:37:34.360
like Best Buy and stuff are scalping them, which is nice.

01:37:35.680 --> 01:37:40.160
So, yeah, if you're interested in purchasing a PlayStation five,

01:37:40.160 --> 01:37:43.040
then you probably want to go to PlayStation dot com to their register

01:37:43.040 --> 01:37:48.200
the buy page and register to do that to see if you can pick one up.

01:37:49.160 --> 01:37:51.200
You know, Jason kind of referenced that in the intro tonight

01:37:51.200 --> 01:37:54.240
about how the retailers must not be so happy about the hat.

01:37:54.240 --> 01:37:57.320
But I also kind of don't scalp it.

01:37:57.440 --> 01:38:00.400
Yeah, I also see why it's in Sony's interest to do that,

01:38:00.600 --> 01:38:03.960
especially when we talk about, you know, these shortages of consoles.

01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:06.600
You know, we had that story about Microsoft a couple of weeks ago.

01:38:06.920 --> 01:38:09.400
These shortages don't look like they're going to ease up anytime soon.

01:38:09.400 --> 01:38:11.280
That's a lot of what we're hearing about in the news.

01:38:11.280 --> 01:38:14.400
News outside of gaming world is like how, you know,

01:38:14.400 --> 01:38:16.600
the ships are having troubles getting into docks

01:38:16.600 --> 01:38:19.000
because there's not as many workers, the docks, et cetera.

01:38:19.200 --> 01:38:20.560
It's kind of having this ripple effect.

01:38:20.560 --> 01:38:24.320
Or is it all because of that ship that was stuck in the Suez Canal?

01:38:24.360 --> 01:38:27.920
Is it all because of that is all because of the evergreen that is happening?

01:38:28.480 --> 01:38:29.280
I don't know. I shouldn't.

01:38:29.280 --> 01:38:32.160
I shouldn't laugh because it is a lot of problems.

01:38:33.120 --> 01:38:36.000
But yeah, now we're hearing about these supply chains are picking up.

01:38:36.200 --> 01:38:38.720
But that isn't probably going to have much impact,

01:38:38.720 --> 01:38:40.520
unfortunately, on PlayStation five.

01:38:40.520 --> 01:38:42.080
So. All right.

01:38:42.080 --> 01:38:45.280
And as Joe and her mat says, not really today's

01:38:45.520 --> 01:38:48.080
and referring to today's problems, are they caused by the evergreen?

01:38:48.200 --> 01:38:49.720
But it was a problem for a bit.

01:38:49.720 --> 01:38:53.200
And Mike Deaf says it's column A, column B. All right. All right.

01:38:54.040 --> 01:38:56.160
Moving on. I think this is interesting.

01:38:56.160 --> 01:38:59.760
The all chat or slash all chat is being disabled,

01:38:59.760 --> 01:39:02.880
at least for a brief time in League of Legends there.

01:39:03.080 --> 01:39:06.280
The developers have made a decision to keep this off for a couple of patches

01:39:06.480 --> 01:39:08.120
and ask players for feedback.

01:39:08.120 --> 01:39:12.160
So usually you can use slash all to chat with folks from the other team

01:39:12.160 --> 01:39:13.280
after a match.

01:39:13.280 --> 01:39:16.880
And as I'm sure that goes well in many cases, right?

01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:19.200
I'm sure people know how to behave themselves

01:39:19.320 --> 01:39:21.600
and respect the other players at the end of a match.

01:39:21.760 --> 01:39:25.520
I haven't played League of Legends because the one time I did play it,

01:39:25.520 --> 01:39:27.760
somebody used that all feature to say something.

01:39:27.880 --> 01:39:30.000
And I decided I didn't want to play anymore.

01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:32.800
So I can and you know, it's interesting.

01:39:34.160 --> 01:39:36.200
I think this could be a response.

01:39:36.200 --> 01:39:38.760
Maybe this is me being a little tinfoil hatty, but I don't care.

01:39:39.840 --> 01:39:42.280
I think this could be a response to Pokemon Unite.

01:39:43.280 --> 01:39:46.560
And why a lot of people are kind of loving that MOBA right now.

01:39:46.560 --> 01:39:48.320
Now, granted, maybe I kind of stopped playing it,

01:39:48.320 --> 01:39:49.640
but I've kind of kept an eye on it

01:39:49.640 --> 01:39:51.920
and I see some streamers that are still doing it and stuff.

01:39:51.920 --> 01:39:54.960
And I think part of why people are apt to play that game

01:39:55.200 --> 01:39:58.040
is because there is no chat feature and that, you know,

01:39:58.040 --> 01:40:01.160
you only have the brief little phrases you can say to each other.

01:40:01.160 --> 01:40:04.520
It's enough to send some basic communication about the game.

01:40:04.640 --> 01:40:06.720
And sure, there's some things that annoy people,

01:40:06.720 --> 01:40:09.480
like people voting to abandon a game too soon and things like that.

01:40:09.680 --> 01:40:11.240
But for the most part,

01:40:11.240 --> 01:40:14.520
not having to put up with the straight up toxic and abusive chat

01:40:14.520 --> 01:40:17.400
that sometimes faces the player chat at the end of a game

01:40:18.600 --> 01:40:20.880
is probably a refreshing feeling. Quite frankly.

01:40:22.320 --> 01:40:23.960
I wish they do this in Dead by Daylight, too.

01:40:24.960 --> 01:40:26.760
I would not miss that postgame chat one bit.

01:40:27.320 --> 01:40:31.440
So anyway, that's why I think the Windows store

01:40:31.440 --> 01:40:33.800
is actually the best place to play Dead by Daylight.

01:40:33.800 --> 01:40:36.920
Actually, Stadia is not bad either, because you can kind of like see it,

01:40:36.920 --> 01:40:39.360
but you're not expected to participate in that chat.

01:40:39.360 --> 01:40:40.760
But anyway. All right.

01:40:43.400 --> 01:40:46.200
Also, you can still see with what League of Legends is doing,

01:40:46.200 --> 01:40:49.200
the control one, two, three, four spam emotes and things like that.

01:40:49.200 --> 01:40:51.240
So it's not going to stop teabagging or anything like that.

01:40:51.720 --> 01:40:54.280
However, it seems like this might not last long.

01:40:54.280 --> 01:40:56.800
The reaction to this change has been negative.

01:40:57.120 --> 01:41:00.040
People saying that, you know, when they actually bond with people

01:41:00.040 --> 01:41:03.440
and when the system works well, they kind of miss that.

01:41:03.640 --> 01:41:06.680
And that the toxic behavior is actually happening with team chats.

01:41:06.680 --> 01:41:10.080
And I could absolutely see that and agree with that as well.

01:41:10.960 --> 01:41:13.920
This has been clarified on Twitter that they're just testing this

01:41:14.080 --> 01:41:17.680
and they will keep or reverse the change based on the feedback they get.

01:41:17.680 --> 01:41:21.600
They should just let people opt in or out of those chats completely, quite frankly.

01:41:22.600 --> 01:41:27.000
Mike Defton chat says, people are still hella toxic in Unite, though. How?

01:41:28.080 --> 01:41:30.520
I guess maybe just through emotes or their actions.

01:41:30.520 --> 01:41:32.080
I could see that that maybe people through there,

01:41:32.080 --> 01:41:36.120
like they start to do actions that negatively impact the team.

01:41:36.120 --> 01:41:39.440
I could see that you're just you're not going to get unfortunate.

01:41:39.440 --> 01:41:43.880
Like people are going to be shitty any way they can sometimes, unfortunately. So.

01:41:45.840 --> 01:41:48.800
And fifth dream says, even the Pokemon moba is toxic.

01:41:48.800 --> 01:41:51.240
So I bet that all chat is terrible.

01:41:52.560 --> 01:41:53.560
All right.

01:41:55.160 --> 01:41:56.160
Let's see.

01:41:56.840 --> 01:41:59.800
Mike Defton says, though, I prefer Unite to other MOBAs.

01:42:00.240 --> 01:42:04.560
All those comments coming from our chat over Twitch.TV slash VOG Network.

01:42:05.080 --> 01:42:06.080
Dark Sakura.

01:42:07.280 --> 01:42:11.480
So this isn't really like super surprising,

01:42:11.880 --> 01:42:19.000
but it turns out that video game industry has really been learning that

01:42:19.840 --> 01:42:23.960
a lot of people are able to work from home.

01:42:24.280 --> 01:42:25.680
They can work remotely

01:42:27.680 --> 01:42:30.840
as long as they've got the machinery that they need for it.

01:42:31.600 --> 01:42:33.240
But yeah, like, for example,

01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:36.080
Asper Media,

01:42:37.280 --> 01:42:39.000
who's based out of Austin, Texas,

01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:43.400
working on Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic remake.

01:42:43.800 --> 01:42:44.560
They're great with it.

01:42:44.560 --> 01:42:46.800
They're letting their people work from home,

01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:50.520
and they are highly productive when doing it.

01:42:51.160 --> 01:42:54.360
Whereas some of these other companies like, no, you have to be here.

01:42:55.400 --> 01:42:58.520
Like you make someone sign an NDA and they can work from home.

01:42:59.360 --> 01:43:02.280
I mean, there's a lot of advantages to it,

01:43:02.280 --> 01:43:05.840
as well as just keeping their employees safe and giving

01:43:05.840 --> 01:43:10.280
giving them a healthier work life balance, I think,

01:43:10.760 --> 01:43:16.120
because they don't have to worry about, you know, the commute, the gas,

01:43:16.320 --> 01:43:20.640
the not seeing their their home, I guess that makes sense.

01:43:21.480 --> 01:43:25.680
But actually being present in a dedicated space for it,

01:43:25.680 --> 01:43:27.840
then they can leave and they're already home.

01:43:28.520 --> 01:43:30.200
That's how I feel about my job anyway.

01:43:30.200 --> 01:43:33.680
Right. I could see where, you know, I know a lot of video game companies

01:43:33.680 --> 01:43:36.160
have been struggling with the whole work at home thing

01:43:36.160 --> 01:43:38.280
because there is so much collaboration that happens.

01:43:38.280 --> 01:43:42.520
I just I would think a hybrid solution is probably very doable

01:43:42.520 --> 01:43:43.520
for a lot of companies.

01:43:43.520 --> 01:43:45.880
We're like, maybe we're in the office Tuesday, Thursday,

01:43:46.080 --> 01:43:48.320
but we're work from home Monday, Wednesday, Friday, something like that,

01:43:48.320 --> 01:43:51.440
where, you know, so at least some of some of those collaborations can happen.

01:43:51.440 --> 01:43:54.960
But I would also greatly see, A, I haven't worked in the game industry,

01:43:54.960 --> 01:43:55.640
so I don't really know.

01:43:55.640 --> 01:43:58.600
B, I could see where maybe that works for some companies, not for others.

01:43:58.960 --> 01:44:01.880
And OK, so.

01:44:02.800 --> 01:44:04.640
But I'm not surprised to hear that some of the companies

01:44:04.640 --> 01:44:05.360
are going to stick with it.

01:44:05.360 --> 01:44:10.320
I'm really not because, you know, the companies can also look at it

01:44:10.320 --> 01:44:15.480
as we can save on not having to rent a giant building for all the office space.

01:44:15.720 --> 01:44:18.760
We can have a small place for the occasional collaborations

01:44:18.760 --> 01:44:21.520
and things like that, but we don't need all this space otherwise.

01:44:21.720 --> 01:44:24.320
I think that's I think that's going to be the most interesting thing post

01:44:24.320 --> 01:44:28.720
pandemic is what happens to a lot of these these job places

01:44:29.000 --> 01:44:31.280
where the workforces are going completely remote.

01:44:32.320 --> 01:44:34.560
Are they going to be like a collaborative workspace

01:44:34.560 --> 01:44:37.040
and you're going to see more of those type of pop up?

01:44:37.520 --> 01:44:38.720
I wouldn't be mad about it.

01:44:38.720 --> 01:44:41.920
I mean, honestly enough, like I was actually just kind of thinking

01:44:41.920 --> 01:44:43.760
about where I work.

01:44:43.760 --> 01:44:49.680
They just built a huge new building in Austin for our group there,

01:44:50.120 --> 01:44:55.320
and they're doing all kinds of building work for for us at mine.

01:44:55.320 --> 01:44:56.880
You know, not saying where I work,

01:44:58.320 --> 01:45:00.480
but at the same time, it.

01:45:02.400 --> 01:45:06.120
I think half of the reason that some companies want people to be

01:45:06.760 --> 01:45:12.280
in in a location is for culture, at least that's what it is with with my job.

01:45:12.440 --> 01:45:14.760
A lot of it has to do with our culture of collaboration.

01:45:15.360 --> 01:45:19.760
But at the same time, you know, I think that.

01:45:21.120 --> 01:45:23.720
There has to come a point where you need to learn

01:45:24.160 --> 01:45:27.760
to balance the bigger picture with that culture,

01:45:27.760 --> 01:45:30.800
and I don't think culture has suffered at all where I work.

01:45:30.800 --> 01:45:33.160
We're still collaborating and we're still talking.

01:45:33.640 --> 01:45:36.360
You know, we're still helping each other out.

01:45:36.360 --> 01:45:37.840
We're just doing it remotely now.

01:45:37.840 --> 01:45:40.040
It just changed the method of our communication.

01:45:40.080 --> 01:45:44.320
Same for us, and we do very different things at our day jobs. Exactly.

01:45:46.240 --> 01:45:48.720
Critical myth in chat says my company is leasing out parts

01:45:48.720 --> 01:45:51.400
of our corporate buildings since they have so many of us working remotely now.

01:45:51.920 --> 01:45:55.400
S.J. 100 Matt says my job was forced to go full remote during the pandemic

01:45:55.400 --> 01:45:56.200
due to the pandemic.

01:45:56.200 --> 01:45:58.000
Excuse me. And we were forced to figure it out.

01:45:58.000 --> 01:46:00.200
Now we have no plans of being back in an office again.

01:46:00.200 --> 01:46:03.280
So it's possible if companies support their staff to get the right equipment.

01:46:03.520 --> 01:46:08.320
And I should have had Matt not to like talk about your business on air too much.

01:46:08.320 --> 01:46:09.440
So I apologize in advance.

01:46:09.440 --> 01:46:12.240
But aren't you like moving to now?

01:46:12.240 --> 01:46:15.600
So because like you don't have to commute as much anymore.

01:46:15.600 --> 01:46:17.680
Like I thought I was picking up on that was a thing.

01:46:18.200 --> 01:46:20.560
And you're not alone in that regard.

01:46:20.560 --> 01:46:21.080
There's a lot of people.

01:46:21.080 --> 01:46:23.880
And you even said in chat there, oh, you moved a year ago.

01:46:23.880 --> 01:46:26.040
Shit, I'm slow, aren't I?

01:46:26.920 --> 01:46:30.240
But OK, so but the point and the why so kind of stands, right?

01:46:30.840 --> 01:46:34.440
S.J. 100 Matt says it's already a huge problem in New York City and San Francisco.

01:46:34.440 --> 01:46:37.080
I'm so curious what San Francisco is going to look like in 10 years.

01:46:37.560 --> 01:46:39.840
So curious.

01:46:39.840 --> 01:46:40.760
I love San Francisco.

01:46:40.760 --> 01:46:42.640
I love the culture. I love the town.

01:46:42.640 --> 01:46:46.160
It's always been prohibitively expensive to do a lot there.

01:46:46.160 --> 01:46:49.360
So I'm super curious to see what this is going to do.

01:46:49.640 --> 01:46:51.040
Going to be interesting.

01:46:51.040 --> 01:46:53.880
Anyway, go ahead.

01:46:53.880 --> 01:46:57.200
I was also just thinking, you know.

01:46:58.400 --> 01:47:02.160
There's a lot of attitudes,

01:47:02.160 --> 01:47:05.960
I think, that are rooted in the old way.

01:47:06.120 --> 01:47:07.640
Does that make sense?

01:47:08.520 --> 01:47:13.960
So I think that it's going to require not just you have to do this for now,

01:47:14.480 --> 01:47:16.520
but there has to be like a total shift of mindset.

01:47:17.840 --> 01:47:20.640
My work wants us back in January.

01:47:20.640 --> 01:47:22.400
I don't think it's going to happen.

01:47:22.400 --> 01:47:26.160
Ours are well, we we've pretty much said we're going to be work

01:47:26.160 --> 01:47:28.480
from home is an option forever, pretty much.

01:47:28.720 --> 01:47:32.000
But they want to do some things in person, which I get like training.

01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:34.240
They want to do in person, which is very near and dear to my heart.

01:47:34.240 --> 01:47:35.760
And I completely get that.

01:47:36.240 --> 01:47:38.280
I should say when it makes sense.

01:47:38.280 --> 01:47:40.880
There are some trainings still virtual is completely fine.

01:47:40.880 --> 01:47:43.040
But I totally get there are some job

01:47:43.720 --> 01:47:45.760
skill based training they really want to do in person.

01:47:46.000 --> 01:47:49.720
So I think it's just a matter of when is it safe to do that really?

01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:53.240
And that kind of keeps getting pushed back for us as well.

01:47:53.440 --> 01:47:57.400
And I they're not they're not saying when I'm

01:47:57.800 --> 01:48:00.480
but I'm guessing January is what they're looking at,

01:48:00.480 --> 01:48:03.920
but kind of not saying anything until they're going to commit to it this time.

01:48:04.520 --> 01:48:05.120
If that makes sense.

01:48:05.120 --> 01:48:05.640
No.

01:48:06.840 --> 01:48:11.600
Mine mine said September and then October and now January and.

01:48:13.680 --> 01:48:16.400
I still don't feel comfortable going back, but it is what it is.

01:48:18.400 --> 01:48:20.520
Yeah. All right.

01:48:20.520 --> 01:48:22.760
Let's move on to our next story, Loki.

01:48:24.240 --> 01:48:27.000
All right, so we're talking about speed runners,

01:48:27.280 --> 01:48:31.120
of course, when we're talking about cheating, and that's the case

01:48:31.120 --> 01:48:36.480
with Barry Mode's record for, I believe, the classic Spelunky.

01:48:36.960 --> 01:48:42.520
And it was found that he had used, I think, a.

01:48:44.240 --> 01:48:49.440
Program to basically kind of it's almost like a task where he was able to

01:48:51.080 --> 01:48:53.560
basically reset points where he.

01:48:54.720 --> 01:48:57.000
Died in like redo that section.

01:48:57.000 --> 01:48:59.840
So he said, well, I, you know, I ran it,

01:49:00.080 --> 01:49:04.920
but, you know, I just remove the this I eliminated the starting over factor,

01:49:05.480 --> 01:49:07.760
because that's why a big part of speed running is hard.

01:49:07.960 --> 01:49:11.560
So he doesn't really think that he cheated, but obviously his

01:49:11.720 --> 01:49:14.960
he's deleted his video, they posted online, they submitted to

01:49:16.560 --> 01:49:19.120
the speed running scene and also, of course,

01:49:20.680 --> 01:49:23.760
didn't confess to any of this stuff until it was pointed out

01:49:24.080 --> 01:49:29.520
that there was a missing tile that was appearing any time that the screen changed.

01:49:29.840 --> 01:49:36.000
And that was a symptom of a certain program that it's used to kind of automate that.

01:49:38.800 --> 01:49:39.680
Shame, shame.

01:49:41.720 --> 01:49:43.400
Pixel pockets and chat says, wow.

01:49:43.400 --> 01:49:43.760
Yeah.

01:49:43.800 --> 01:49:44.080
Wow.

01:49:44.080 --> 01:49:44.480
Indeed.

01:49:47.200 --> 01:49:47.720
All right.

01:49:47.760 --> 01:49:48.040
Yeah.

01:49:48.040 --> 01:49:52.000
And it was apparently it was such a good record that, you know,

01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:53.000
no one's been able to beat it.

01:49:53.040 --> 01:49:58.320
Well, yeah, obviously, because, you know, wasn't all through one run, but.

01:50:00.320 --> 01:50:02.200
Yeah, what are you going to do?

01:50:02.200 --> 01:50:02.760
All right.

01:50:02.760 --> 01:50:03.840
I know disqualify him.

01:50:03.840 --> 01:50:04.320
That's what you're going to do.

01:50:04.320 --> 01:50:05.320
That's what you're going to do.

01:50:05.320 --> 01:50:05.760
All right.

01:50:06.760 --> 01:50:08.960
Lastly, tonight, before we get to the roundtable,

01:50:09.280 --> 01:50:12.240
I want to talk about this, I think this is great.

01:50:12.480 --> 01:50:15.440
The Xbox Series X fridge is happening.

01:50:15.480 --> 01:50:17.600
It's a real thing and you can preorder it.

01:50:17.840 --> 01:50:18.520
Here's the thing.

01:50:18.520 --> 01:50:22.360
They made it a mini fridge, I guess, to make it a little more consumer.

01:50:22.560 --> 01:50:25.680
I'm assuming with all the problems going on with deliveries in the world,

01:50:25.680 --> 01:50:28.000
so probably makes it a little easier to deliver on to.

01:50:28.200 --> 01:50:31.480
But the Xbox mini fridge will be available for the holidays.

01:50:31.760 --> 01:50:36.480
The fridge costs one hundred dollars and preorder start in two days.

01:50:36.480 --> 01:50:37.400
So the 19th.

01:50:38.920 --> 01:50:45.080
So, yeah, the mini fridge, of course, is like the actual fridge that Xbox tweeted.

01:50:45.080 --> 01:50:48.760
I think they who think if they give one to Snoop Dogg and somebody else, I think.

01:50:48.760 --> 01:50:51.000
Yeah. So they gave the fridge the fridge.

01:50:51.440 --> 01:50:54.800
But the mini fridge will still be great for storing your weed.

01:50:54.960 --> 01:50:59.040
If you want to put that in there and a couple of sodas or whatever.

01:50:59.360 --> 01:51:01.520
So anyway, I think that's great.

01:51:01.520 --> 01:51:03.760
I think that's so funny. I actually kind of want one.

01:51:03.760 --> 01:51:04.960
I'm going to be honest.

01:51:05.160 --> 01:51:07.840
I imagine it's the size of an actual Xbox console.

01:51:09.080 --> 01:51:10.120
I think that's really cool.

01:51:11.040 --> 01:51:12.480
Mike Deff says I would buy it.

01:51:12.720 --> 01:51:14.640
Fifth Dream says store your KFC in it.

01:51:14.640 --> 01:51:18.560
Sure. Although I hope you I hope you like Kentucky Fried Gold.

01:51:20.480 --> 01:51:21.920
Anyway, I think that's great.

01:51:22.320 --> 01:51:25.480
All right, let's get to the roundtable.

01:51:25.880 --> 01:51:28.680
We will try to get I don't know if anybody wants to call.

01:51:28.680 --> 01:51:31.560
Join the green room so I can get an idea how many calls we have.

01:51:31.760 --> 01:51:34.640
But I know we have emails tonight, so I'm going to get to it.

01:51:35.360 --> 01:51:38.440
Oh, Bobby Black Wolf says, considering it for the basement.

01:51:38.440 --> 01:51:41.240
Oh, do it. It looks so good down there, Bobby.

01:51:41.240 --> 01:51:43.960
Right out right outside of Black Wolf Theater.

01:51:43.960 --> 01:51:48.640
It'd be great, especially, you know, keep some keep some sodas in there and, you know,

01:51:48.640 --> 01:51:52.760
maybe wine or beer if you're so inclined that people can enjoy while they're having a movie.

01:51:52.760 --> 01:51:54.640
I love that. Love that.

01:51:55.840 --> 01:51:58.680
Pixel Pocket says they said it can hold 12 cans.

01:51:58.680 --> 01:52:02.120
So it's probably a little bigger than just your typical Xbox Series X.

01:52:02.320 --> 01:52:03.960
Yeah, that makes sense. Probably a little bigger.

01:52:03.960 --> 01:52:08.080
So anyway, your emails participate at orange.traded.com.

01:52:08.080 --> 01:52:12.120
And it's I feel like for weeks and weeks on the show, I've said no emails, no emails, no emails.

01:52:12.480 --> 01:52:14.240
And now we got three.

01:52:14.560 --> 01:52:15.880
Yeah, we got a few. Let's get to it.

01:52:15.920 --> 01:52:16.920
Dark Sakura.

01:52:18.920 --> 01:52:20.800
So first one's a little long.

01:52:20.800 --> 01:52:22.480
OK. Hello, LR.

01:52:22.480 --> 01:52:26.160
I was catching up on slightly out of date episodes and I figured I'd drop a line.

01:52:26.160 --> 01:52:29.960
But since I can't fit a fishing line in here, an email will happen instead.

01:52:30.000 --> 01:52:31.000
Whomp.

01:52:31.440 --> 01:52:35.680
During the October 3rd episode, there was a bit of confusion regarding two games,

01:52:35.680 --> 01:52:37.120
Paddle Dipon and Puzzle Dipon.

01:52:37.640 --> 01:52:39.760
The confusion is totally understandable.

01:52:39.760 --> 01:52:44.400
I didn't realize it at the time I was listening, but both games were actually released in Japan during the same year.

01:52:45.400 --> 01:52:49.560
With such similar games and release dates, it's no wonder they're easy to confuse.

01:52:49.800 --> 01:52:56.400
Amazingly, despite its undoubtedly low distribution for the U.S., Puzzle Dipon, the first puzzle bobble style game ever released

01:52:56.960 --> 01:53:02.640
by Visco for Neo Geo, came out in America first before anyone had ever played Tetris Attack.

01:53:03.360 --> 01:53:09.040
The game that many of us are familiar with Tetris Attack was the North American rebranding of Paddle Dipon,

01:53:09.440 --> 01:53:16.320
which actually released for SNES the following year, 1996, which is this

01:53:18.080 --> 01:53:21.760
that I just showed up on on cam for those who are watching live.

01:53:24.200 --> 01:53:28.880
But the truly most astounding fact about both games is that according to the O.L.R.

01:53:28.880 --> 01:53:32.240
fandom page, neither one has been featured as an O.L.R.

01:53:32.240 --> 01:53:33.480
classic game of the week.

01:53:33.480 --> 01:53:39.200
As a fan of both games, I would love to see both are one of them honored sometime in the future.

01:53:39.560 --> 01:53:40.800
Well, if wishes were fishes.

01:53:41.240 --> 01:53:47.600
Anyway, Dark Sakura will consider your request and get back to you in an appropriate time frame when she feels is appropriate.

01:53:48.440 --> 01:53:50.840
Which will be a very long time.

01:53:52.600 --> 01:53:56.920
There was something Rob mentioned during the same episode that I found to be pretty funny.

01:53:57.920 --> 01:54:03.440
He said he'd been to round one and played the latest version of Beatmania 2DX28 Beastrover.

01:54:03.640 --> 01:54:07.760
Well, guess what? As of October 13th, there was no longer the latest version.

01:54:07.760 --> 01:54:10.720
Beatmania 2DX29 Cast Hour is available.

01:54:10.720 --> 01:54:15.560
So sorry, Rob. You have not, in fact, played the latest version lol.

01:54:15.640 --> 01:54:18.600
I think somebody called that out live in chat or on Twitter or something.

01:54:18.600 --> 01:54:22.720
Yeah, so that's I'm still waiting for that round one out in Roseville nearby.

01:54:23.360 --> 01:54:26.000
When Misty was here, I don't think I brought this up on the show.

01:54:26.240 --> 01:54:30.880
Long time fan of the show, super fan, Misty OLR was out here last weekend.

01:54:30.880 --> 01:54:37.640
And she and I went on a she wanted in and out because, of course, East Coasters, they come visit, they want in and out.

01:54:38.040 --> 01:54:40.400
So we went. But I was like, well, we have time.

01:54:40.400 --> 01:54:43.640
So you didn't say which in and out something you do the in and out by Golf Land.

01:54:43.880 --> 01:54:45.800
So we drove all the way out to that one.

01:54:46.040 --> 01:54:49.000
And then I was like, while we're out here, let's point and laugh at Golf Land.

01:54:49.000 --> 01:54:55.960
So we did that. And then I said, let's go to the mall because I want to see how far along the round one construction.

01:54:55.960 --> 01:54:59.080
Is sadly, it doesn't look like it's quite done yet.

01:54:59.080 --> 01:55:02.440
The movie theater looks like the movie theater looks like it'll open first.

01:55:02.440 --> 01:55:04.320
Yes. They had the poster frames out.

01:55:04.720 --> 01:55:11.760
They have the the movie theater says coming twenty twenty one and round one says coming twenty twenty two.

01:55:11.760 --> 01:55:13.560
So it's not going to be this year.

01:55:13.720 --> 01:55:16.200
By that time, thirtieth style will be out.

01:55:17.160 --> 01:55:23.280
Anyway, and I was I was peeking in there, too, because we just went to the mall this week and I was peeking in

01:55:24.280 --> 01:55:26.480
because they have doors open to see the construction.

01:55:26.480 --> 01:55:28.200
It's it's all empty in there.

01:55:28.200 --> 01:55:30.760
Like, I don't think they're anywhere close to opening.

01:55:30.800 --> 01:55:32.160
Oh, wow. All right.

01:55:32.160 --> 01:55:33.160
And I'm sorry. Sorry, Dr.

01:55:33.160 --> 01:55:34.280
Zarka, you may continue.

01:55:35.360 --> 01:55:38.840
OK, I'll leave you all with this.

01:55:38.840 --> 01:55:43.280
I've decided for the second year in a row to do a charity Twitch stream around my birthday in mid-November,

01:55:43.600 --> 01:55:48.080
during which I attempt the Ohio DDR Max 300 birthday challenge.

01:55:48.400 --> 01:55:52.560
Basically, you have to clear Max 300 as many times as your age,

01:55:52.800 --> 01:55:56.280
with at least half of those being on the hardest difficulty you can pass.

01:55:57.160 --> 01:56:01.120
So for me this year, that means forty two times twenty one of them on expert

01:56:01.520 --> 01:56:04.840
exact date charity and other details to be announced later.

01:56:05.040 --> 01:56:10.600
But last year I supported Feeding America and most likely I'll be doing that again.

01:56:11.000 --> 01:56:16.440
I hope that some of you will join me as long as you can stand listening to the same song forty two times.

01:56:16.440 --> 01:56:19.120
I promise I'll make it as interesting as I possibly can.

01:56:19.560 --> 01:56:21.960
Thanks, as usual, for the show and have a great week.

01:56:22.080 --> 01:56:26.320
Why? Why are I figured it had to be why? Why are good luck?

01:56:26.320 --> 01:56:32.920
I will not be joining you in participating, but I will if you're streaming or whatever, I'll happily join you to say hello.

01:56:33.200 --> 01:56:37.120
So and cheer you on, because that sounds like a heart attack for me.

01:56:38.160 --> 01:56:39.920
But I love that for you.

01:56:39.920 --> 01:56:42.880
And I hope you're able, you know, don't push yourself.

01:56:42.880 --> 01:56:45.080
Listen, your body, if your body says stop, stop.

01:56:45.160 --> 01:56:49.640
That's my only that's that's going to be my my dad moment

01:56:49.640 --> 01:56:52.400
there for somebody who's going to be a year younger than me.

01:56:53.880 --> 01:56:56.400
All right. But good luck with it and yay for charity.

01:56:57.640 --> 01:56:59.720
Next email real fast.

01:56:59.720 --> 01:57:01.320
Hello, O.L.R.

01:57:01.320 --> 01:57:05.440
Last week, Rob mentioned having some comfort issues when playing Metroid Dread.

01:57:05.760 --> 01:57:09.600
I was wondering if you've been using the switch pro controller when you play it.

01:57:09.920 --> 01:57:13.520
I just beat the game over the weekend, and at one point I switched

01:57:13.560 --> 01:57:15.560
a handheld mode and played most of the Joy-Cons.

01:57:15.560 --> 01:57:20.320
And yeah, it didn't feel comfy with Metroid, since it's a lot of usage of triggers.

01:57:20.720 --> 01:57:24.080
It's a night and day difference to play that game using a pro controller.

01:57:24.520 --> 01:57:26.320
Anyways, I hope you're enjoying it.

01:57:26.320 --> 01:57:30.680
Fusion is my favorite 2D Metroid, but this game might be even better for me.

01:57:31.000 --> 01:57:34.520
Now I'm just looking forward to a successor to one of my favorite games

01:57:34.520 --> 01:57:37.680
ever made, Metroid Prime. Keep on playing Garth Wolf.

01:57:38.080 --> 01:57:42.040
Well, you probably heard it early in the show, but I am using a pro controller,

01:57:42.040 --> 01:57:44.840
specifically the Splatoon with the green and pink on the bottom.

01:57:45.160 --> 01:57:49.720
And you can go about my my personal channel doesn't have the videos.

01:57:49.720 --> 01:57:52.720
So you go right to the end of the last stream and you can kind of see when I'm

01:57:52.720 --> 01:57:56.120
like kind of hurting and I explain it a little more what I'm going through.

01:57:57.120 --> 01:58:01.680
That's very ironic because Shane, who's still in chat.

01:58:01.680 --> 01:58:06.440
So correct me if I'm wrong, played the game with those regular Joy-Con controllers,

01:58:06.440 --> 01:58:07.320
but they were plugged.

01:58:07.320 --> 01:58:09.680
I think he just played the switch in portable most of it.

01:58:09.840 --> 01:58:11.200
So you're just kind of plugged in there.

01:58:11.200 --> 01:58:13.480
And he, as he said, he didn't have any problems.

01:58:13.480 --> 01:58:15.960
So I think it just it really depends on the person.

01:58:16.040 --> 01:58:20.880
It sounds like let's be real, probably partially the age in my case.

01:58:21.280 --> 01:58:26.160
Who knows? Anyway, I'm I'm

01:58:26.720 --> 01:58:28.840
I'm favorable to the game.

01:58:28.840 --> 01:58:31.560
It just I had to shift my mindset a little bit.

01:58:31.560 --> 01:58:36.000
It wasn't what I was expecting at first, but I appreciate what it's trying to do.

01:58:36.720 --> 01:58:40.560
Again, the control, the controller thing is just that red flag emoji meme.

01:58:40.560 --> 01:58:43.800
That's all. Anyhow, that's all I have to say.

01:58:45.000 --> 01:58:47.680
Last email. Hi all.

01:58:47.680 --> 01:58:50.720
To be a tad different with this email compared to my previous ones,

01:58:50.720 --> 01:58:53.720
I figured that I would provide answers to a question that folks may have

01:58:53.720 --> 01:58:59.080
regarding gaming after a stroke, but for whatever reasons haven't been asked.

01:59:01.280 --> 01:59:03.360
I kind of know already, but

01:59:04.360 --> 01:59:08.960
well, what it's like trying to game now that I've had a stroke compared to before.

01:59:08.960 --> 01:59:13.920
Well, it's a lot harder seeing as I only have the use of my left hand.

01:59:13.920 --> 01:59:17.920
Some games can easily be played one handed, like some pinball games.

01:59:18.280 --> 01:59:22.320
Magic and Diablo, other games like first person shooters and fighting games.

01:59:22.320 --> 01:59:25.560
I haven't figured out a way to play them effectively yet.

01:59:26.040 --> 01:59:28.640
It's incredibly frustrating. Is it possible?

01:59:28.640 --> 01:59:29.480
I don't know.

01:59:29.480 --> 01:59:31.360
Maybe any game that can be played

01:59:31.360 --> 01:59:35.160
with the mouse only or can be played with rebound keys are doable.

01:59:35.560 --> 01:59:39.560
If anyone wants additional info, feel free to ask and chat tangentially.

01:59:39.560 --> 01:59:41.680
Tonight might be my last dream for a while.

01:59:41.680 --> 01:59:44.200
I'm moving in the morning and I don't know if.

01:59:45.760 --> 01:59:48.960
I don't what's an NRE place has Internet.

01:59:50.960 --> 01:59:54.360
So. Yeah, ask. Ask.

01:59:55.880 --> 01:59:57.400
No one really.

01:59:59.600 --> 02:00:02.040
Again, sorry, you're going through that.

02:00:02.040 --> 02:00:04.040
But and the moving and everything.

02:00:04.040 --> 02:00:04.880
Good luck with the move.

02:00:04.880 --> 02:00:07.400
Moving is a pain, but good luck with all that.

02:00:07.640 --> 02:00:09.280
We're not going to be here next week anyway.

02:00:09.280 --> 02:00:11.520
So it gives you two weeks to find a Wi-Fi to steal.

02:00:11.520 --> 02:00:15.600
So I hope that works out in your favor for what that is worth.

02:00:15.600 --> 02:00:18.080
I think it meant for streaming.

02:00:18.080 --> 02:00:22.520
Oh, well, yeah, just to get get a Wi-Fi connection to stream the show.

02:00:24.200 --> 02:00:27.920
Just to do his streaming, I think. Oh, oh, oh, yeah, yeah.

02:00:28.160 --> 02:00:29.840
That might be a difficult for sure.

02:00:29.840 --> 02:00:32.200
Yeah. So. All right.

02:00:32.200 --> 02:00:33.480
But thanks for the email, nonetheless.

02:00:33.480 --> 02:00:39.000
And I always like to hear from gamers perspectives from their shoes.

02:00:39.440 --> 02:00:43.120
You know, we've heard from over the years gamers in other countries

02:00:43.120 --> 02:00:45.480
who it's not as easy to buy video games.

02:00:45.720 --> 02:00:50.120
We've heard from gamers who are blind and, you know, have faced

02:00:50.120 --> 02:00:51.160
those type of challenges.

02:00:51.160 --> 02:00:53.600
And we get to hear about some of those types of workarounds.

02:00:53.920 --> 02:00:56.600
I always like to kind of hear from gamers that make us kind of stop

02:00:56.600 --> 02:00:59.440
and think and kind of go like, oh, this is this is,

02:01:00.640 --> 02:01:02.960
you know, gaming is for everyone, right?

02:01:02.960 --> 02:01:07.000
So I kind of like to hear like how some people, the lengths

02:01:07.000 --> 02:01:10.040
that they'll go to make sure that they get the gaming experiences.

02:01:10.040 --> 02:01:12.760
I think that's a good thing for us all to be aware of, too.

02:01:13.320 --> 02:01:16.440
I still say look for switch controls like next switch.

02:01:18.000 --> 02:01:21.760
Because they make those for quadriplegics.

02:01:22.480 --> 02:01:25.560
And I know people who are like

02:01:25.880 --> 02:01:29.920
doom masters and play with their neck.

02:01:31.600 --> 02:01:35.880
Only She-Hulk in chat reminding us Microsoft has a great controller

02:01:35.880 --> 02:01:37.320
for that as well.

02:01:37.320 --> 02:01:39.880
So that's yes, that's a great call out, too.

02:01:39.920 --> 02:01:43.120
So well, and I think that's any Apple product comes with switch control

02:01:43.120 --> 02:01:45.400
built in. Hmm. Cool. So.

02:01:47.080 --> 02:01:51.400
All right. Oh, I didn't check to see if we had a green room.

02:01:51.400 --> 02:01:53.720
OK, we don't have any callers that want to call in tonight.

02:01:55.520 --> 02:01:58.720
But I think we're at about 830, which is usually would be wrapping up anyway.

02:01:58.720 --> 02:02:00.280
The podcast is going to seem a little smaller,

02:02:00.280 --> 02:02:02.680
but that's because, of course, we got a late start tonight.

02:02:02.680 --> 02:02:04.800
We didn't start till 630 because the power outage.

02:02:04.800 --> 02:02:07.200
So thanks for that up.

02:02:07.200 --> 02:02:09.560
Let me quickly, though, before we completely wrap up tonight,

02:02:09.560 --> 02:02:11.520
check in with any last minute stories, Loki.

02:02:13.040 --> 02:02:15.520
Just that Sony has threatened

02:02:15.520 --> 02:02:19.520
dbrand with legal action because they were offering those alternative

02:02:19.840 --> 02:02:23.800
black face plates for the PlayStation five.

02:02:23.800 --> 02:02:27.360
And while dbrand

02:02:28.000 --> 02:02:30.920
did mention that the texture that were on those face

02:02:30.920 --> 02:02:34.080
plates was familiar, but legally distinct.

02:02:34.120 --> 02:02:36.520
Apparently, it wasn't as legally distinct as they thought.

02:02:36.760 --> 02:02:40.640
So, yeah, those have been taken down and they made a shit post

02:02:40.760 --> 02:02:44.320
about it on Reddit instead of, you know, responding to Sony.

02:02:45.560 --> 02:02:48.040
Obi Wan Jabroni in chat says, I have those plates.

02:02:48.480 --> 02:02:49.160
How do you like them?

02:02:49.160 --> 02:02:52.040
Was it worth it? Legit, curious.

02:02:52.040 --> 02:02:54.200
I don't even have PlayStation five still.

02:02:54.200 --> 02:02:55.920
It's probably not going to happen this holiday,

02:02:55.920 --> 02:02:58.960
but probably next summer, I'll end up getting one.

02:02:58.960 --> 02:03:00.160
That's about the right time frame.

02:03:00.160 --> 02:03:03.160
So anything else, Loki?

02:03:04.720 --> 02:03:06.640
No, that's it. All right.

02:03:06.640 --> 02:03:08.840
Well, then let me take an opportunity to thank everybody

02:03:08.840 --> 02:03:11.320
for supporting Orange Launch Radio and coming out,

02:03:11.320 --> 02:03:13.400
whether you were listening live here on Sunday night

02:03:13.400 --> 02:03:17.440
and stuck through the power outage and all that stuff to actually

02:03:19.320 --> 02:03:21.440
be here live with us tonight. I appreciate that.

02:03:21.800 --> 02:03:22.600
Thank you. Thank you.

02:03:22.600 --> 02:03:24.400
Thanks to my hosts for being patient.

02:03:24.400 --> 02:03:28.560
Thanks to Bobby Blackwell for vamping in the face of that silly power outage.

02:03:28.720 --> 02:03:32.040
I did get a nice reply from social media person for the power company here.

02:03:32.240 --> 02:03:36.840
So, yeah, they said, I hope you were able to do your show.

02:03:36.840 --> 02:03:39.800
Sorry, we're working to get it done or something like that.

02:03:39.800 --> 02:03:43.560
So, you know, at least with them, like with Smud,

02:03:43.560 --> 02:03:46.680
like I had to say that their customer service has actually been pretty great

02:03:46.680 --> 02:03:51.000
because we've had it before where they will call me when the power is out.

02:03:51.000 --> 02:03:54.120
They're like, hey, we know that your power is out, you know, like

02:03:54.120 --> 02:03:55.280
and I wasn't even home.

02:03:55.280 --> 02:03:58.680
I was like, oh, OK, it's going to be restored at this time, you know.

02:03:59.320 --> 02:04:02.400
So they preemptively call, whereas like if Comcast was out,

02:04:02.400 --> 02:04:04.200
they'd be just like, we don't exist.

02:04:04.200 --> 02:04:06.560
I don't I don't have a problem with the power company here.

02:04:06.560 --> 02:04:07.320
They are pretty good.

02:04:07.320 --> 02:04:10.480
I'm I'm very happy with who we have compared to the alternative

02:04:10.480 --> 02:04:12.720
that the rest of the state has most of the rest of the state has.

02:04:13.680 --> 02:04:17.000
So and I'll I'll I'll send a nice reply to their social media person.

02:04:17.000 --> 02:04:20.680
It's just frustrating that the power was out on Monday

02:04:20.680 --> 02:04:23.640
and then the power was out again right before O.L.R.

02:04:23.640 --> 02:04:26.800
like it just we had to replace food in the fridge because we lost power

02:04:26.800 --> 02:04:29.680
for 12 hours. So, yeah, anyway.

02:04:31.000 --> 02:04:36.480
But I get that the wind dictated that not necessarily the power company.

02:04:36.480 --> 02:04:38.600
It is what it is. All right.

02:04:38.600 --> 02:04:41.240
Anyway, I was going to give the rest of my spiel, but Dark Soccer,

02:04:41.240 --> 02:04:43.280
I know you need a little extra time to prepare for your stream.

02:04:43.280 --> 02:04:45.880
So I thought I'd let you go ahead and give your exit now

02:04:45.880 --> 02:04:47.880
and then I'll give the rest of spiel and sign off for the night.

02:04:47.880 --> 02:04:49.040
So Dark Soccer, any final thoughts?

02:04:50.240 --> 02:04:52.600
I do have certain people that I would like to share

02:04:52.600 --> 02:04:55.200
my community with next week while I am gone.

02:04:55.600 --> 02:05:00.560
So I will be listing them and letting people know.

02:05:00.760 --> 02:05:05.400
But they're people who I who I trust to take good care of y'all.

02:05:06.880 --> 02:05:10.880
All right. And stay tuned for some dead by daylight, because I have a vendetta.

02:05:12.240 --> 02:05:16.360
All right. I have to I have to just argue against MMR before

02:05:17.480 --> 02:05:20.880
Barista Witch comes out on Tuesday.

02:05:20.880 --> 02:05:24.280
What's her name? Michaela? Like that's such a.

02:05:24.280 --> 02:05:25.200
Post-millennial.

02:05:25.200 --> 02:05:28.480
I thought you liked Michaela because she is you.

02:05:28.880 --> 02:05:33.120
She is me. Don't get me wrong, but people are going to be toxic as shit with her.

02:05:33.200 --> 02:05:34.840
I know. I know.

02:05:34.840 --> 02:05:38.160
But in her nickname now in all the circles in any way is Barista Witch.

02:05:38.160 --> 02:05:40.160
So because that's exactly what she is.

02:05:40.200 --> 02:05:42.160
She is a barista and a witch.

02:05:43.360 --> 02:05:45.520
All right. We'll see you in two weeks.

02:05:46.560 --> 02:05:49.360
All right. See you in the cloud, in the cloud, in the fog.

02:05:49.840 --> 02:05:54.840
All right. Let me give the rest of my spiel here and then we'll get around to final, final thoughts.

02:05:55.200 --> 02:05:59.920
So first off, thank you guys so much for downloading or listening to our podcast live tonight.

02:06:00.120 --> 02:06:03.400
If you enjoyed what you heard here at OLR, tell a friend or two, help us spread the word.

02:06:03.560 --> 02:06:07.440
We are the show where every gamer has a voice, but we need the voices here to get out on air

02:06:08.440 --> 02:06:10.440
to have more voices.

02:06:10.440 --> 02:06:14.440
We have a shop if you're interested in that, vognetwork.com slash shop.

02:06:14.440 --> 02:06:18.440
If you would like to pick up some OLR merchandise or possibly some fog network merchandise,

02:06:18.440 --> 02:06:25.440
a Bobby Black Wolf mug, whatever, whatever tickles your fancy, check that out over vognetwork.com slash shop.

02:06:25.440 --> 02:06:30.440
Otherwise, we'll be back in two weeks. We will not be here next week.

02:06:30.440 --> 02:06:35.440
Dark Sakura talked about at the beginning of the show, she has some personal issues she's going to tend to

02:06:35.440 --> 02:06:38.440
in, in the place where she grew up and I'm going to Disneyland.

02:06:38.440 --> 02:06:41.440
So two, two very different reasons to not be here.

02:06:41.440 --> 02:06:45.440
Loki will be using next. What are you going to do next week with a week off, Loki?

02:06:45.440 --> 02:06:46.440
Play Minecraft.

02:06:46.440 --> 02:06:49.440
I was gonna say play Minecraft, work on videos, something like that?

02:06:49.440 --> 02:06:50.440
Probably, yeah.

02:06:50.440 --> 02:06:53.440
You could do a stream. I bet Bobby would pass the viewers to you.

02:06:53.440 --> 02:06:55.440
I could do a stream.

02:06:55.440 --> 02:06:56.440
Think about it.

02:06:56.440 --> 02:06:58.440
I could do a stream. That is a possibility.

02:06:58.440 --> 02:07:01.440
DDR in the garage might work. We'll see.

02:07:01.440 --> 02:07:03.440
Haven't played DDR in a while.

02:07:03.440 --> 02:07:05.440
I was thinking about it the other day too.

02:07:05.440 --> 02:07:09.440
Get some inspiration from that YYRE email.

02:07:09.440 --> 02:07:11.440
Yeah.

02:07:11.440 --> 02:07:13.440
All right. We'll see.

02:07:13.440 --> 02:07:15.440
We'll see. All right. Let's see.

02:07:15.440 --> 02:07:17.440
So we'll be back in two weeks.

02:07:17.440 --> 02:07:21.440
So Loki, Loki, we won't see you for three weeks because

02:07:21.440 --> 02:07:25.440
you're, you're not going to be here on Halloween night because obviously you have children

02:07:25.440 --> 02:07:27.440
and you're obligated to take the children trick or treating.

02:07:27.440 --> 02:07:29.440
So I totally understand that.

02:07:29.440 --> 02:07:32.440
But yeah, good luck with all your Minecraft production

02:07:32.440 --> 02:07:35.440
and I'm excited for you with all these updates and all that stuff.

02:07:35.440 --> 02:07:38.440
So yeah, any final thoughts for our listeners tonight?

02:07:39.440 --> 02:07:42.440
No, just hoping to have another video out this week.

02:07:42.440 --> 02:07:45.440
Lots of updates to my base I'm doing.

02:07:45.440 --> 02:07:48.440
It's all the Ninjago, Lego Ninjago theme.

02:07:48.440 --> 02:07:54.440
So I've been basing my first section off of the actual official Lego Ninjago city set

02:07:54.440 --> 02:07:56.440
and it looks pretty awesome.

02:07:56.440 --> 02:07:57.440
Awesome.

02:07:57.440 --> 02:08:00.440
My final thought, I'll plug my channel over twitch.tv slash Rob Roberts.

02:08:00.440 --> 02:08:02.440
I've been pretty good for two weeks now.

02:08:02.440 --> 02:08:04.440
Like I've gotten in at least three streams a week after.

02:08:04.440 --> 02:08:07.440
I have hit one of the milestones for partner finally.

02:08:07.440 --> 02:08:10.440
Finally. I've been like doing this for a long time.

02:08:10.440 --> 02:08:12.440
No, it's not the viewer one.

02:08:12.440 --> 02:08:14.440
That's clearly the hardest one to get.

02:08:14.440 --> 02:08:16.440
But I have done 12 different streams in the past month.

02:08:16.440 --> 02:08:19.440
So follow me over twitch.tv slash Rob Roberts.

02:08:19.440 --> 02:08:21.440
I'm really close to 500 followers.

02:08:21.440 --> 02:08:22.440
That's kind of a landmark.

02:08:22.440 --> 02:08:24.440
So yeah, I would appreciate that.

02:08:24.440 --> 02:08:26.440
But it's all good either way.

02:08:26.440 --> 02:08:28.440
We'll see you back here at Vaga Network in two weeks.

02:08:28.440 --> 02:08:30.440
Bobby will be here next week though.

02:08:30.440 --> 02:08:35.440
So, you know, come come here at your usual time at 5 Pacific 8 Eastern

02:08:35.440 --> 02:08:36.440
and he'll be here to entertain.

02:08:36.440 --> 02:08:39.440
He can do another jumbo show potentially next week.

02:08:39.440 --> 02:08:40.440
So there is that.

02:08:40.440 --> 02:08:41.440
That's it.

02:08:41.440 --> 02:08:42.440
Have a great week.

02:08:42.440 --> 02:08:44.440
Happy gaming.

02:08:44.440 --> 02:08:45.440
Happy Halloween.

02:08:45.440 --> 02:08:46.440
We'll be back on Halloween night.

02:08:46.440 --> 02:08:49.440
Happy Rocky Horror season to my friends who are participating with that

02:08:49.440 --> 02:08:53.440
and getting their first show back like I am in a very long time.

02:08:53.440 --> 02:08:55.440
That is going to be awesome.

02:08:55.440 --> 02:08:58.440
And yeah, be safe out there.

02:08:58.440 --> 02:09:00.440
Make good choices.

02:09:00.440 --> 02:09:01.440
Wear your mask.

02:09:01.440 --> 02:09:02.440
Get vaccinated.

02:09:02.440 --> 02:09:03.440
That's it, everybody.

02:09:03.440 --> 02:09:04.440
Have a great night.

02:09:04.440 --> 02:09:07.440
