00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,860
This week, Facebook's outage made its managed games and apps, including Oculus, unplayable,

2
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:18,680
Sony is ending the PS3 and Vita's digital marketplace again, and the accessible games

3
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:22,880
database received wide coverage, hopefully cementing its place as a de facto guide.

4
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:24,260
Why is that last one included?

5
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:28,700
Because its need to exist is depressing to consider, but so beneficial that it does.

6
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:31,860
These are just a few of the galvanizing stories of the week, now it's time for your hosts,

7
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:34,980
Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to talk about them and the rest of the week's gaming

8
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:37,860
news, starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.

9
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:46,740
Hello my friends out there on the internet, welcome back to another week of the show where

10
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:48,140
every gamer has a voice.

11
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:55,620
It is Orange Lounge Radio and we are live once again with episode number 887 of our

12
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:59,420
show for tonight, October the 10th of 2021.

13
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:03,780
My name is Rob Roberts and I'm here with you every week, along with my co-hosts.

14
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:07,580
Say hello over there to Jamie Summers, DarkSakura, how are you?

15
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:09,020
I'm wrapping up a pink drink.

16
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:10,020
A pink drink?

17
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:11,020
Oh, yum, yum.

18
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:12,020
Those are, those are...

19
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:13,020
I thought that was supposed to be...

20
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:14,260
This is what's left of it.

21
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:19,620
I thought those were supposed to be like a limited time thing and then it ended up sticking

22
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:20,780
around for a long time.

23
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:29,220
So it was an off, it was actually an off menu item, like a secret menu item.

24
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:30,220
Got it.

25
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:33,900
And it's been incorporated into the new reality of Starbucks.

26
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:36,680
Well, I have coffee, but it's just boring old.

27
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:40,380
I use my little machine to make the coffee, but I have backup soda.

28
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:43,340
It's an important part of getting through tonight's show.

29
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:44,900
Also with tech master, Loki.

30
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:45,900
Hello.

31
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:46,900
Hi, Loki.

32
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:47,900
How are you?

33
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:48,900
I'm doing all right.

34
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:50,980
What are you playing behind you tonight?

35
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:51,980
CarnEvil.

36
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:52,980
CarnEvil.

37
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:53,980
Okay.

38
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:54,980
That was, I'm like, wait a minute.

39
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:55,980
He switched.

40
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:56,980
It was like Donkey Kong beforehand or something.

41
00:01:56,980 --> 00:01:57,980
He switched it.

42
00:01:57,980 --> 00:01:58,980
That was last week.

43
00:01:58,980 --> 00:01:59,980
I have the...

44
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:00,980
Oh, okay.

45
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:01,980
Oh yes.

46
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:02,980
A little variety is good.

47
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:03,980
Yes, it is.

48
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:08,860
Hey, if the topic of food here on this program, which sometimes I would say we get criticized

49
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:12,260
for talking about food too much on this program, but that actually doesn't happen.

50
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:15,500
That's just me trying to keep things on topic sometimes I think.

51
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:20,900
For those of you guys that are excited about a food talk, I have some good news.

52
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:24,400
We do tape live every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern at the

53
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:28,780
Voice of Geeks Network, live at Twitch TV, twitch.tv slash vog network.

54
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:29,860
If you want to join along.

55
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:35,220
We are usually after the Bobby Black Wolf show, but he is on hiatus for a little bit.

56
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:36,220
Bobby is doing fine.

57
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:37,940
I've talked to Bobby.

58
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:39,860
Bobby's just not ready to be podcasting again.

59
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:44,460
So stay tuned to our discord for all the details on when the Bobby Black Wolf show will return

60
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:47,140
at five Pacific eight Eastern right before our show.

61
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:51,660
Again, our discord is over at twitch, twitch.tv.

62
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:57,420
How about twitch.tv slash vog network and then vog network.com slash discord.

63
00:02:57,420 --> 00:03:00,380
I do believe Bobby is out there in listener land tonight though.

64
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:01,380
So hi Bobby.

65
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:02,380
And I hope you're feeling well.

66
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:09,200
And on the topic of food last week, I teased, maybe we need to do a bonus stream.

67
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,200
That's just nothing.

68
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:14,100
Maybe we need to make orange lounge foodie-o a reality.

69
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:16,060
So I have good news, everybody.

70
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:18,580
We're going to enable a channel point reward tonight.

71
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:22,580
And if we can get 100,000 points, which we'll, we'll get those points because we, we did

72
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:24,680
like 150 for the last one and we got it.

73
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:29,180
So, but, uh, if you're willing to spend some points, uh, we're going to open it.

74
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:30,660
Oh yes, Bobby just hit the button.

75
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:31,880
There we go.

76
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:36,980
A special orange lounge foodie-o presentation here at vog network where we will talk about

77
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:38,880
nothing but food.

78
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:43,340
So dark Sakura can talk about all the pink drinks or other Starbucks drinks she wants.

79
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:47,180
Loki can talk about all the bacon infused things he's tried lately.

80
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:49,940
And I will, I will talk about crazy flavored potato chips.

81
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:51,340
You know, that's a thing for me.

82
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:59,460
I just had, um, Alan found these at Costco, uh, and it looks really nasty on the cover,

83
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:02,580
but it's Buffalo chicken flavored lays.

84
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:05,860
So stay tuned to orange lounge foodie-o to hear more about that.

85
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:08,620
I see some of you guys in chat donating already.

86
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:10,580
Thank you guys very much for that.

87
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:14,540
We're, we're already, wow, we're already over 10% of the way there.

88
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:18,660
You guys are nuts, but in the best, what are the other special lays right now, Rob, just

89
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:20,380
out of curiosity, I don't know.

90
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:21,740
That was the only one that we saw.

91
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:23,540
I didn't know they put out a new batch.

92
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:29,820
Um, but it was, it had the label on it called like, um, pre pre get no tailgate favorites.

93
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:33,860
So they're tying it in with, um, that just doesn't sound delicious.

94
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:37,780
Not the super bowl, but like, I guess the playoff games and stuff, because baseball

95
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:39,580
got big stuff, right?

96
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:43,300
The like other chip flavored lays.

97
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:45,860
So like Cheetos, Funyuns, and Doritos.

98
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:46,860
That was the thing.

99
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:48,020
I think that has already gone.

100
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:51,660
I think that sometimes those promotions are sometimes blink and you miss it.

101
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:54,460
And in my opinion, the only good one was the Funyuns.

102
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:56,900
The others were really under, I thought the Cheetos one was terrible.

103
00:04:56,900 --> 00:05:01,620
Uh, but anyway, I didn't even know there were Funyun ones.

104
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:04,480
There were, there were, they were wavy, but there, there were all right.

105
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:07,740
More talk like this on, uh, see, see how easy food.

106
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:12,820
But it's an important part of a video gaming is the snacks and all that good stuff that

107
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:13,820
we have.

108
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:18,220
Uh, so orange launch video coming soon, probably, probably after Halloween, I'd say early November

109
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:23,100
is a good target time, assuming, I mean, if we raise 20 K points every night, we're going

110
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:24,140
to be there in no time.

111
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:27,500
So probably coming to you in early November, we'll set the date soon.

112
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:29,700
Maybe we can do it on like 19 November or 20 November.

113
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:32,340
I'll have to check on what days those are, but that would be a lot of fun if it works

114
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:33,340
up with everybody.

115
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:34,340
Yeah.

116
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:35,340
That'd be a lot of fun.

117
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:36,340
That'd be a special thing to do.

118
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:37,340
So we'll try.

119
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:38,940
All right.

120
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:40,940
Do the thing.

121
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:41,940
Do the thing.

122
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:43,940
Uh, I haven't even contributed my own points yet, so I'll do that.

123
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:45,940
Uh, let's get into some gaming news.

124
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:47,260
There was a lot going on this week.

125
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:49,500
We had a special Nintendo direct.

126
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:50,500
We knew this was coming.

127
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:54,140
That's the fun thing about doing this show weekly and live is that sometimes at the end

128
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:59,440
of the show, we're like, Hey, seven days when we're back seven days, but when we're back

129
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:03,720
here to do it all again in seven days, we're going to know some things that we didn't know

130
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,860
on episode eight 86.

131
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:12,540
And now we know the complete roster for super smash brothers, ultimate, the last character

132
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:15,820
was revealed in a special direct, but the news really didn't end there.

133
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:16,820
Right?

134
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:17,820
Loki.

135
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:18,820
We had a lot of stuff, right?

136
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:19,820
Yes.

137
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:24,780
So, uh, they announced that yes, the last character in this Nintendo series, absolutely

138
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:28,480
not missing any Nintendo characters whatsoever.

139
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:30,260
This is absolutely complete.

140
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:31,620
Nobody's missing.

141
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:36,860
But now we have Sora, um, from kingdom hearts in smash brothers.

142
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:43,300
When he's not canon, that's not canon anymore.

143
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:44,300
Interesting.

144
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:48,100
How, so I think it'd actually be a really good character to have.

145
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:52,820
I, Hey, look, I would have loved Waluigi as well, but like, I get it.

146
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:57,220
And I I'm not, look, they should have done two characters, then we'd be only expecting

147
00:06:57,220 --> 00:06:58,220
one.

148
00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:00,460
Then this game would never end.

149
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:01,620
It'd be over.

150
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:02,620
No, this would be the last.

151
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:04,660
They just do the last two characters instead.

152
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:11,020
That way you like, you get everybody hyped up by like, Oh, it's Sora Waluigi Waluigi's

153
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:12,020
there too.

154
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:19,220
They have to save somebody for the sequel Sakurai will never sleep again.

155
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:20,220
I'm just kidding.

156
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:21,860
Like he sleeps anyway, let's soccer.

157
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:23,580
I have a fucking vacation.

158
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:25,180
Send him to Tahiti.

159
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:27,840
He's deserved it anyway.

160
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:32,600
So along with the announcement that Sora is going to be in smash brothers, you may be

161
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:33,600
thinking, well, wait a second.

162
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:37,440
Kingdom hearts isn't on the switch, but then you'd be wrong because it is now on the switch

163
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,580
or it's going to be coming.

164
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:39,580
But then you'd be wrong.

165
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:45,880
Cause it's not really on a cartridge because you have to stream it because the switch can't

166
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:47,600
run Kingdom hearts.

167
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:53,080
And so, um, but yeah, you can pay to stream it.

168
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:56,720
Which is, it's not the first time they've done like control is a cloud game.

169
00:07:56,760 --> 00:08:00,000
And I know in Japan, the cloud based switch gaming has been more popular.

170
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,480
I think there is a bit of surprise out there in the community that Kingdom hearts one and

171
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:13,520
two HD remix are part of this, that, um, those games ran on a PlayStation three.

172
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:16,640
So you would think the switch would be capable of those first two games.

173
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:21,880
Uh, it's just maybe a question of maybe square just didn't want to do it.

174
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:24,960
Maybe they didn't think they'd sell enough of them to put out the cartridges or I don't

175
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:25,960
know.

176
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:29,120
So for whatever reason, uh, they're doing it as a combo cloud path.

177
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,120
Yeah.

178
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,120
It's cool.

179
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,920
You know, Kingdom hearts, this isn't popular at all.

180
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:35,880
So we're just not going to put out cartridges, but Kingdom hearts is so popular that we're

181
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:37,880
going to include its character in smash brothers.

182
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:43,240
Uh, but your contradiction, Bobby black Wolf is in chat to remind you over twitch.tv slash

183
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:45,880
vog never see, even though he doesn't have a show, he's here to correct you.

184
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:48,760
Loki, uh, Bobby reminds you that three D S had Kingdom hearts.

185
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:51,080
It was literally called Kingdom hearts three D yes.

186
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,080
Drop drop.

187
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,080
This is not the switch.

188
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,080
Sorry.

189
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:57,080
It's, it's not the card.

190
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:58,880
There was that card game on the Gameboy advance.

191
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:03,540
I know the three D has had tons of things on it, but the three D S doesn't exist anymore.

192
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:04,540
It's only the switch.

193
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:11,960
And so therefore Kingdom hearts on a Nintendo console, not a console it's on a handheld.

194
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,000
Yes.

195
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:19,120
There's been several Kingdom hearts properties and things like that, but not on an actual

196
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,120
console.

197
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:25,840
I, it makes as much sense as having cloud and separate off in the lineup do, and it's

198
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:26,840
fine.

199
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,080
Like I really have no problem with it.

200
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:32,920
I I'm honestly more surprised, honestly, that they got Sora for it, but at the same time,

201
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:33,920
they were able to get cloud.

202
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:34,920
They were able to get separate.

203
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:38,960
I know we should have seen all this stuff, you know, cloud and separate off both from

204
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:39,960
Kingdom hearts.

205
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:46,200
So, I mean, obviously, you know what I mean, Loki, it's like the other big square franchise

206
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:53,120
that probably, probably has a lot of Venn diagram overlap with Nintendo fans and square

207
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,600
and Nintendo are both well aware.

208
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,600
Agent 47.

209
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,600
Yep.

210
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:59,800
He would have been a, you know, the next character if they were doing more characters.

211
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:02,160
I, I honestly think Sora is a fine addition.

212
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,160
I don't know.

213
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:06,000
I don't know why y'all are hot and bothered Loki it's, it's fine.

214
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
It's fine.

215
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,360
I don't care.

216
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:10,240
I think it's interesting.

217
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:14,760
You know, there's the Disney side of it too, you know, because Disney has a stake in this.

218
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:19,800
So I think there's a lot of people that are very interested about the fact that you know,

219
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,280
Disney's allowing this in there.

220
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:24,860
And some people have noticed some subtle differences.

221
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:29,520
For example, like the, the stage that they added that has that infamous stained glass

222
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:32,520
window that's like in the intro to the Kingdom Hearts games.

223
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:37,360
If you look really carefully, you'll notice Donald and Goofy are not there.

224
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:41,400
It's they got replaced by more generic types of art, not characters, but like, I think

225
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:44,200
like one is now a ship and one's a star, whatever.

226
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:48,560
So Disney very carefully only licensed Sora.

227
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:53,000
There was a very tongue in cheek sort of tweet that was going around that showed the Mickey

228
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:58,940
head that's on the Keyblade saying something like this shot probably cost Nintendo more

229
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:01,560
than actually licensing Sora.

230
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:08,500
To that I would say that's not going to be true because when you license Sora's likeness,

231
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:11,400
that Mickey head is part of the Keyblade.

232
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:13,380
So they licensed that.

233
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:18,540
And I, you know what, I'm sure a company like Disney had final cut approval on the trailer

234
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:20,540
and everything in between.

235
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:24,340
So it didn't, it didn't cost him as much as you think it did.

236
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:29,260
Nintendo probably went to Disney and Square and said, Hey, you know, our top five selling

237
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:31,820
game, Super Smash Brothers.

238
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:36,620
We want to put one of your characters as a paid character in this game.

239
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:41,460
You literally don't have to do anything, but let us use it in our already established critically

240
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:42,820
popular game.

241
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:47,440
And we project based on these projections of other characters, such as Cloud and Sephiroth,

242
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:52,760
your company will make millions of dollars off this DLC for doing nothing.

243
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:55,640
How does that sound?

244
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:56,640
Deal done.

245
00:11:56,640 --> 00:12:00,060
If only they could make that same deal for Super Mario RPG, but I guess that's a whole

246
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:03,580
other whole other issue.

247
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:04,580
So there's that.

248
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:05,580
Um, let's see.

249
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:10,080
And then, uh, along with that, I was gonna say we also got some Mii Fighter costumes

250
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:12,180
as well coming and wait, I'm sorry.

251
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:13,180
I'm sorry.

252
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:14,180
There's some really, I'm sorry.

253
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:15,180
I have to read these chat comments that are on topic.

254
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:16,180
Cause they're really good.

255
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:17,180
Sorry.

256
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:19,740
Uh, Bobby Black Wolf says one of those things that I was told a bit ago is that the Mickey

257
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:22,820
mouse ears are not actually controlled by Disney.

258
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:26,540
It's the only Disney iconography that they don't control.

259
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:27,540
That's interesting.

260
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:32,580
Uh, Jamie, you've been down that rabbit hole more than us is, have you heard that?

261
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:33,580
Actually yes, I have.

262
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:39,380
Um, cause I think that's why a lot of independent, um, artists are making like their own mouse

263
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:41,740
ears, for example, that they can sell them.

264
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:52,020
I think that the likeness of a mouse ears can't necessarily be trademarked only specific

265
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:55,340
dimensions of it to use it in purpose as a logo.

266
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:56,340
Interesting.

267
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:57,340
Hmm.

268
00:12:57,340 --> 00:12:58,340
Yeah.

269
00:12:58,340 --> 00:13:01,260
I'll have to dig a little bit more into the legalities about it, but I do recall that

270
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:03,100
having been something.

271
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:04,100
Yeah.

272
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:08,300
And, uh, Bobby went to yield Google and found that, uh, they do not own the copyright.

273
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:12,180
I would have guessed it was tied to that whole, uh, Disney has been deathly afraid

274
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:16,700
of Mickey going in the public domain for quite some time that they actually have these laws

275
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:22,500
that they get passed in Congress that they call them Disney laws that basically is extending

276
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:26,380
the timeframe that intellectual property is held by companies.

277
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:30,020
And they're, they're, they're basically to prevent Mickey mouse from going public domain

278
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:35,100
because when that happens, all the Mickey mouse porn will be available.

279
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:41,460
So thank God that hasn't happened yet because there certainly isn't any Mickey mouse pornography

280
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:42,700
in the internet.

281
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:44,040
There's more to it as well.

282
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:49,060
There's also in terms of generics, like, I don't know if, I mean, a lot, probably a good

283
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:53,800
number of our listeners may not remember this, but back in the like early eighties, there

284
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:58,300
used to be this ad going around with showed like a massive copier and said, don't call

285
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:04,660
it Xeroxing or like, and you hear this more, more often

286
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:10,300
in Europe, but like vacuuming called hoovering because of the Hoover vacuum.

287
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:11,300
Yes.

288
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:12,300
Yeah.

289
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:18,180
You know, uh, when you put on your, uh, it doesn't matter what the brand it is, you know,

290
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:21,460
also over there, if you put on your rain boots, you're putting on your wellies.

291
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:26,500
Well, I think, I think Nintendo, Nintendo's had this problem too, is that everybody's

292
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:30,460
like, I'm going to go play Nintendo even when it's a Sega Genesis, because people have a

293
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:32,380
certain age don't know better sometimes.

294
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:33,380
Right.

295
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:34,380
Exactly.

296
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:42,020
But I think that there's also that Mickey mouse in general.

297
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:48,980
Has also sort of fallen a little bit into that semi generic, but more in terms of description,

298
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:53,300
you know, like, like, Oh, it's just your Mickey mouse, you know, like talking about a mascot

299
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:56,060
or a main character.

300
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:57,060
That's I've heard that.

301
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:58,060
Yeah.

302
00:14:58,060 --> 00:14:59,060
All right.

303
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:00,060
Anyway, good, good chat.

304
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:03,780
It also shed some light on that little tongue in cheek tweet.

305
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:07,860
So don't believe, I mean, it was a funny tweet, like as, as far as like the humor value.

306
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:08,860
Great.

307
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:11,580
But at the same time, don't believe everything you read on social media.

308
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:14,760
It's not always extremely well-researched right.

309
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:15,760
I'm sure we knew that.

310
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:16,760
Anyway.

311
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:17,760
Uh, and Bobby, Bobby's adding.

312
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,660
I remember when we all used to TiVo things.

313
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:20,660
Yes.

314
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:22,460
Even Netflix is a generic now.

315
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:23,460
Pod culture.

316
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:24,460
You think about it?

317
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:25,460
It is.

318
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:26,460
It kind of is right.

319
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:29,140
Netflix and chill can still be Disney plus.

320
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:32,420
In fact, that's Mike's right about Google it.

321
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:33,420
Yeah.

322
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:34,420
Yeah.

323
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:37,780
Rest in peace Bing.

324
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:38,780
You know what?

325
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:39,780
I never used Bing.

326
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:40,780
I hated it.

327
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:42,860
I used to use one called hot bot.

328
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:43,860
Hot bot.

329
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:44,860
Okay.

330
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:45,860
It's back now.

331
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:49,780
However, I learned the hard way that if you make a typo, it pulls up porn.

332
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:55,540
What about, uh, ask Jeeves was what was, what were some of the other Alta Vista Alta Vista.

333
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:59,260
Oh, I got to put my brain was my jam in like the nineties.

334
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:00,820
It was another one.

335
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:01,820
What's that?

336
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:02,820
Legos.

337
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:03,820
Oh Yahoo.

338
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:04,820
Oh yeah.

339
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:07,860
Well before it was a, uh, I, uh, a place.

340
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:10,860
I don't know what to call it.

341
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:13,540
Yahoo is now like the trailer park of the internet.

342
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:18,420
And I, no offense to, you know, but it's just, you know, it's, it's, it's a place that's

343
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:19,420
there in the town.

344
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:20,420
All right.

345
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:25,100
Uh, anyway, Doug Doug Doug go by the way is a lot more modern I think.

346
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:29,420
So I don't know that it can be thrown into the, the realm yet.

347
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:30,420
Lycos.

348
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:31,420
That was the one I was trying to think of.

349
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:32,420
Anyway.

350
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:33,420
All right.

351
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:36,460
And I just used AOL back in the day cause I had a free account.

352
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:39,100
So all of my stuff was AOL.

353
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:40,100
Back in the day.

354
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:41,100
Ooh.

355
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:42,100
Okay.

356
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:43,100
Sj 100 Matt with your next trivia night question.

357
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:45,980
And then Loki, I swear we'll go back to you for the other news that was announced.

358
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:51,260
Um, Sj 100 Matt says, what about the time that Disney traded a human being for one of

359
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:52,620
their properties?

360
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:59,460
They traded sportscaster contract, Al Michaels from ABC to NBC for the Oswald, the rabbit

361
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:04,860
trademark Oswald was made when Walt worked for universal and Disney wanted it because

362
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:07,360
it was the one property they didn't own.

363
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:11,300
And hello, that ties back to gaming Epic Mickey too, where that was a, you know, Oswald was

364
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:13,080
a huge plot device in that.

365
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:15,760
So I'm fascinating.

366
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:16,760
I didn't know.

367
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:20,340
I, I mean like now that you mentioned that, like I probably did know that, but I forgot

368
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:21,340
it.

369
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:22,340
So yeah, that seems to track.

370
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:24,060
Yeah, it tracks.

371
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:25,060
Exactly.

372
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:26,060
All right.

373
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:30,740
Uh, Loki, now we can go back to, uh, the, uh, direct news.

374
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:31,740
I guess.

375
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:36,860
I mean, so we can talk about copyright if you want more, uh, me fighters that have been,

376
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:40,260
uh, or DLC for me fighters that have been released as well.

377
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:44,060
So they had a Splatoon inspired Octaline.

378
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:48,780
And then of course the one that everybody's really excited about was the doom Slayer.

379
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:51,300
So now he can finally get that match up.

380
00:17:51,300 --> 00:18:01,060
And um, they also had, uh, let's say, uh, Judd, which I guess is a referee kitten.

381
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:02,060
I don't know.

382
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:03,060
I don't play a splatoon.

383
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:04,060
Oh, yeah.

384
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:05,060
Oh yeah.

385
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:09,700
At the end of every stage that, that fat little kitty that comes out and waves the flag saying

386
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:13,940
who won is the little meter goes that it's that it's that thing.

387
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:14,940
Yeah.

388
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:15,940
Yeah.

389
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:23,020
Those were the, uh, the things you can buy for 75 cents, 75 whole cents.

390
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:28,020
You know what though, for the doom guy versus, uh, Isabelle matchup, it's worth it.

391
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:33,060
And all the doom fans hoping that that would be the last character are having a sad because

392
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:34,980
all you get is the me, but you know what?

393
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:37,420
They threw a lot of stuff was actually on the console.

394
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:40,740
So, you know, there's that they threw a lot of stuff into the me's though.

395
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:42,740
I remember undertale was all in there too.

396
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:43,740
And that was a big deal.

397
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:47,220
I think of how many more characters we could have gotten if they didn't include fire emblem

398
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:48,220
into that.

399
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:50,940
It's like 80 characters right there.

400
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:53,100
Some people kind of like fire emblem though.

401
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:59,740
So you get one like everybody else you've had your one, maybe two, maybe two, maybe

402
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:00,740
two.

403
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:04,900
And you can get some like shadow fighters or something like that, where you have like

404
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:09,340
80 different, you know, uh, they're the same character, but they look different, you know,

405
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:13,380
type of thing, you know, that's what I'm surprised we didn't get more of.

406
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:16,300
But then again, that's also kind of the me's in a way.

407
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:24,580
So I'm, I think, look, as much as I liked, I'm not saying this in a way to be shady Smash

408
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:25,580
Brothers.

409
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:27,060
It's an iconic game.

410
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:31,180
It is legendary status, especially in tournament and competitive scenes and all this stuff.

411
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:35,860
All that being said, it's time for the life cycle of this game to come to a close.

412
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:39,420
Like it's, it's been the headline for years and years now.

413
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:40,420
It's time.

414
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:43,340
It's time to let Sakurai take a nap.

415
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:44,340
Go on a nice trip.

416
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:46,600
There's more people working on it than just Sakurai.

417
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:47,600
That's true.

418
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,940
They can move on to another game.

419
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:54,380
Like honestly, hello, I'd like a new Kid Icarus if they'd like to go back to that, but you

420
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:55,380
know what?

421
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:59,500
Sakurai's earned the right to do whatever period the fuck he wants, period.

422
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:03,060
You're telling me that no one could come up with characters for Smash Brothers other than

423
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:04,060
Sakurai?

424
00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:05,940
I mean, that seems a little ridiculous to me.

425
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:08,020
But that team and that group.

426
00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:09,620
Okay.

427
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:10,620
Yeah.

428
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:11,620
They have a good team, but other people can do that.

429
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:16,420
I mean, if it was easy to make a Smash Brothers game, Nickelodeon, Nicktoons, Smash might

430
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:18,380
play a little better.

431
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:21,380
It does play pretty well.

432
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:23,500
All right.

433
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:28,720
Anyway, um, SSG100Matt says, you say these things, Rob, but the Smash community still

434
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,220
won't let Melee go.

435
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:31,220
And that's okay.

436
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:33,800
I won't let Final Fantasy 6 go.

437
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:36,780
And I know they're doing these pixel remasters and I don't care.

438
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:39,660
A good video game never has to go away.

439
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:42,500
We need a 3D remaster of 6.

440
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:43,500
That would be amazing.

441
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:45,180
A la like 7.

442
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:50,940
Even if the systems fade out and you don't get to buy the system anymore, that's why

443
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:53,600
we have emulators and all that good stuff.

444
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:54,600
Remember this point.

445
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:57,020
It's going to be relevant again later in the show.

446
00:20:57,020 --> 00:21:02,580
Anyhow, for now, anything else out of that direct that you want to mention, Logi?

447
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:03,580
Nope.

448
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:04,580
That's it.

449
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:05,580
Nope.

450
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:06,580
All right.

451
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:10,780
The Doom Slayer DLC, that Mii costume actually comes out on the 18th.

452
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:14,180
So we've got a little bit of time still for that next week.

453
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:15,460
All right.

454
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:16,460
Okay.

455
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:17,460
Let us move on.

456
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:20,660
We're going to go to our gaming weeks and talk about the types of video games that we

457
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:22,180
have been playing this week.

458
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:27,220
Actually, Dark Soccer, before we get specifically into your gaming week, um, you've been very

459
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:30,020
in and all about the Twitch culture lately.

460
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:32,620
So there's a couple of things I wanted to ask you about.

461
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:37,860
Number one, you're doing another big marathon tomorrow, but this is unlike the last one

462
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:38,860
you did.

463
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:40,480
This is a charity related thing, right?

464
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:44,420
So I know you plugged it on last week's show, but since it is tomorrow night, give a, give

465
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:47,340
a good old plug for what you're doing tomorrow.

466
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:51,620
So, um, I am doing a 12 or more hour marathon.

467
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:52,620
It depends.

468
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:59,460
Um, my dear friend, Barbara, um, who is one of the people who practically raised me, I

469
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:03,980
adult raised me, um, when I was in college, took really good care of me.

470
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:09,780
Um, her and Maggie, um, has, uh, recently been diagnosed with cancer.

471
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:16,700
Um, it sounds like it's aggressive, um, but, uh, she's already undergoing treatment and

472
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:27,260
I wanted to, um, uh, try to help, uh, sponsor, uh, some of that, uh, treatment by, uh, promoting

473
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:28,740
her go fund me.

474
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:34,860
Um, so what I'm doing, and if you give me just a brief moment, let me get, uh, a link

475
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:36,340
to that real quick.

476
00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:43,980
Um, because I am, uh, doing a marathon with, uh, goals.

477
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:49,320
So my first, you know, the first one is like, if I raise a hundred bucks, then, you know,

478
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:55,380
you get something, uh, you know, I'll, I'll do like, let people choose my killer or something

479
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:57,180
in dead by daylight.

480
00:22:57,180 --> 00:23:01,620
Um, if, hold on, here's the, here's the link to my tweet.

481
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:08,380
I put it in, uh, and the tweet is actually a, uh, um, what's the word pinned pin tweet

482
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:10,860
on my profile, just a at dark Sakura.

483
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:13,260
Um, but I'm going to be doing some rewards.

484
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:17,720
I'm also going to be doing some giveaways, uh, for some of my merch, like the death hook

485
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:19,700
for cutie stuff.

486
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:26,340
Um, but my goal is to try to raise, I want to at least like, see if I can throw in a

487
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:28,660
grand, you know, cancer treatment is not cheap.

488
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:29,660
Sure.

489
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:36,580
So, um, and I said that if we can hit 5,000, I will play survivor.

490
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:39,140
That's a big goal, but I'm going to wish you well on that.

491
00:23:39,140 --> 00:23:40,140
I'll be there.

492
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:41,140
I might lower it.

493
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:42,140
Huh?

494
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:43,140
I might lower it.

495
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:44,140
All right.

496
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:45,140
Well, shoot for the stars.

497
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:46,140
Shoot for the stars.

498
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:50,940
But I am going to end up after a few hours, even though I am making it a redeem.

499
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:59,620
I am planning on doing a couple of kill your friends matches and I might do a survive with

500
00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:00,620
friends.

501
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:04,100
Oh, fun as like a bonus or something, you know?

502
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:10,580
So it's not really playing survivor, but it's playing survivor.

503
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:11,580
Makes sense.

504
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:12,580
Yeah, of course.

505
00:24:13,540 --> 00:24:18,420
On top of that, I'm planning on inviting a few other streamer friends to participate

506
00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:20,500
in some of these matches with me.

507
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:28,260
I do have a semi confirmation from the piggy Ubu, who is like my pig goo best do.

508
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:34,060
And I wanted to, you know, people have been really supportive and have helped me promote

509
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:40,820
like, I actually made friends with the new streamer who put it right in his discord for

510
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:41,820
me.

511
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:42,820
Will Jinkies.

512
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:43,820
Oh, nice.

513
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:47,100
He's working his way toward affiliate right now.

514
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:51,820
Really fun LGBTQ plus streamer.

515
00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:57,540
And I've also, you know, a couple of the friends I want to thank.

516
00:24:57,540 --> 00:25:02,980
Lapain Tay has said something just, you know, friends have been really supportive.

517
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:08,220
But yeah, I am really looking forward to it.

518
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:11,300
I will link the GoFundMe as well.

519
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:19,780
And if you screenshot for me your donation and link it to me either via discord, a whisper

520
00:25:19,780 --> 00:25:28,140
in Twitch or on my private message on my Twitter, then you will, depending on the tier, be entered

521
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:34,180
in for one of the item drawings, one of the giveaways, and your funds will count toward

522
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:35,180
the goals.

523
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:36,180
Awesome.

524
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:37,340
Awesome.

525
00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:38,340
Well, good luck.

526
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:42,300
I hope you are able to get a lot of money for a really good cause.

527
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:43,300
Thank you.

528
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:44,300
Yeah.

529
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:50,260
I, Barbara is like one of those people in the world that like seriously means the universe

530
00:25:50,260 --> 00:25:56,380
to me like, and I, I, I just want to make things easier.

531
00:25:56,380 --> 00:25:58,780
And then another of their roommates may have had a stroke.

532
00:25:58,780 --> 00:26:00,840
I don't know yet.

533
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:08,760
So they're in a really tough situation and desperately need, need the help.

534
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:11,600
Before we get to your gaming week, you said, or did you already shout out who you wanted

535
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:12,600
to shout out?

536
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:15,720
I shouted out two people, but I'd like to give another couple of shout outs.

537
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:16,720
Sure.

538
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:21,880
So of course, Will Jinkies, new streamer, awesome person.

539
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:28,280
The Pigu Uwu, who is my piggy bestu, my pigu bestu, I'm sorry.

540
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:32,920
And these are all dead by daylight things for those that don't know what, because out

541
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:37,000
of context could mean something very different, but this is a dead by daylight thing.

542
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:41,560
Just to be clear, if you haven't figured that out about dark soccer by now, she's a fan.

543
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:52,080
Um, uh, empire TV is another, uh, is, uh, um, uh, POC, uh, streamer, uh, really awesome.

544
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:54,160
And in my home state.

545
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:56,360
So I got to share the Alabama love.

546
00:26:56,360 --> 00:27:02,280
And then, um, a newer friends, so lingerie and it's spelled exactly like it sounds.

547
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:08,800
So lingerie S O L A N G E R I E, who I made friends with.

548
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:17,760
And I actually, um, put it up on my TikTok, uh, I met, I met them memeing in dead by daylight.

549
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:23,320
It was during the pustule flowers and, uh, their, uh, party was all going around trying

550
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:25,600
to get people to look at the flower with them.

551
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:26,520
I see.

552
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:32,280
And I realized what they were doing and I went in for boops first.

553
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:33,800
I thought they wanted to do a boop match.

554
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:37,520
And then I was like, Oh, the flower.

555
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:40,680
And so I looking dead, look at the flowers.

556
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:46,640
And so I, I poked at it as pig, and then we all like farmed and

557
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:48,120
maimed and I made new friends.

558
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:50,640
That game is wild sometimes.

559
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:51,400
All right.

560
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:53,720
Uh, let's get into, it's all about making friends.

561
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:54,800
Let's get into your gaming week.

562
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:57,400
And the other, is it been all dead by daylight or have you been

563
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:58,200
playing some other stuff too?

564
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:02,560
Um, I, of course it's been mostly dead by daylight.

565
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:08,200
Um, I actually, uh, did a forego of my stream last night, just because I wanted

566
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:10,400
to prep for Monday and I've been really tired.

567
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:16,640
Um, I, I've been playing, um, Fantasian cause that's what I stream on Tuesdays

568
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:19,600
and I need to grind, I'll put it that way.

569
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:24,000
My ass got handed to me on my last boss battle, but that game is so pretty.

570
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:25,320
I love it.

571
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:29,120
And they've actually, uh, just done an update for Fantasian.

572
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:33,840
So there's some new, uh, end game content and some, and they've added a new game

573
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:42,560
plus so rad cause that game could freaking use it, um, I have, uh, I've got

574
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:47,200
Final Fantasy 14 and I'm, uh, actually I put up a poll and only three people

575
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:51,800
replied to it, so I might do another poll, but I'm thinking my Wednesday nights

576
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:55,760
after work is just going to be doing a just chatting stream while playing

577
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:59,880
Final Fantasy 14, so folks want to chat.

578
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:02,880
I can't play new world, like every body fucking else in the world.

579
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:06,160
So I'll play the MMO I can play.

580
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:11,320
All right, let's go to Loki with your gaming week.

581
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:14,840
You're muted.

582
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:17,880
Loki, the joys of sorry.

583
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:18,680
No, you're fine.

584
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:19,120
No better.

585
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:22,240
Um, so it pretty much the same as last week.

586
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:26,640
It's been mostly Minecraft with a little bit of power wash simulator.

587
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:32,680
So, um, I did end up picking up Metroid dread and the Nickelodeon, um, all star

588
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:37,600
brawl game, uh, which I know my kid has been playing the Nickelodeon all star

589
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:40,720
role, they're not going to touch Metro cause they they're afraid of that game.

590
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:45,680
Um, eventually I will play it cause it looks really good.

591
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:48,360
So, um, but you know, I had to get it.

592
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:52,320
But yeah, I'm power washing sim.

593
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:56,920
I think I, the last thing I did was the firehouse.

594
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:59,680
Oh, I'm not even up to that yet.

595
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:03,120
I'm as far, so I played that on stream.

596
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:04,520
I know I missed it.

597
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:05,680
I was like, oh man.

598
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:09,680
Well, all of my streams are archived all over at my channel, but I know who wants

599
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:12,840
to watch in the archive streams, you know, usually you're looking for a certain

600
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:14,320
thing, but it was a, what we did.

601
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:17,920
I washed one of the houses, but I feel like there's more than one house, so I

602
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:19,920
don't know how to, how to better say it.

603
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:25,120
So, um, but what I unlocked, no, it was two story, two story.

604
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:25,440
Okay.

605
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:25,640
Yeah.

606
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:30,800
What I unlocked was a skate park and we went in there right at the end of the

607
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:34,640
stream and it's like, there's just bullshit everywhere on that stage.

608
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:36,400
I was like, this one's going to take a little while.

609
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:39,000
Cause I did, I did the house start to finish on stream.

610
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,080
I only did that.

611
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:42,360
And the golf cart, the golf cart took me like 10 minutes.

612
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:42,720
Yeah.

613
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:45,320
The house like was like an hour and a half.

614
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:46,760
Like it was an hour and a half until I was done.

615
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:49,120
But it went by really, really fast.

616
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:50,240
It was a fun stream.

617
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:51,680
Yeah.

618
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:52,440
Awesome.

619
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:53,600
All right.

620
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:54,560
Anything else for your gaming week?

621
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:56,080
Nope.

622
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:56,440
That was it.

623
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:57,400
Just those two things.

624
00:30:58,040 --> 00:31:01,520
Um, for my gaming week, I have been trying to, you know, I say this a lot.

625
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:04,440
I'm trying to stream more, but I think I found a good rhythm that works for me.

626
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:06,680
And that is that period right after I'm off work.

627
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:11,040
So, um, the best time to try to catch me live is going to be around

628
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:14,000
like four 30 ish Pacific to around six.

629
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,640
I usually end by then I don't go much longer than an hour and a half.

630
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:20,000
Maybe two hours, just because I don't want to get into the evening stuff.

631
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:23,320
Especially when my husband, Alan does a lot of streaming in the evenings.

632
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:26,080
I'm like kind of all over the place.

633
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:27,960
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday is depending on when he's around.

634
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:30,320
So, um, yeah, so I found a good space.

635
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:31,760
I actually did a bit of streaming.

636
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:33,800
I did a one night of Final Fantasy.

637
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:37,760
I did a night with the power wash simulator and I did a Metro dread on Friday.

638
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:42,120
So yes, I picked up Metro dread and I went in, I went into Metro dread, really

639
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:46,160
sight unseen, like you guys know, I kind of held back on some of the trailers and

640
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:47,520
some of the description of the game.

641
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:51,000
Like once the initial launch trailer was out, that's all I needed.

642
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:52,960
New Metroid game coming sold.

643
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:53,720
That's all I need.

644
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:54,560
I don't need anything else.

645
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:56,760
Um, so I played the game.

646
00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:00,920
I was not expecting that this Metroid is survival horror.

647
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:05,160
And of course I had people in my chat, like Bobby Black Wolf, that are like,

648
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:07,520
the name of the game is literally Metroid dread.

649
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:08,520
What were you expecting?

650
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:13,560
And I was like, I don't know, but I just, this is not super Metroid anymore.

651
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:16,920
When did this become survival horror, where you go into a certain zone and

652
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:18,760
now this big red dot is chasing you.

653
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:21,000
And if they catch you, you are one-shotted.

654
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:24,040
Like that's some pretty serious stuff.

655
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:29,720
So I ended up screaming a lot more like the, you know, like when you go

656
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:34,800
behind the door, like that whole type of thing was like, that should be the

657
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:40,800
name of the game is Metroid because that would more accurately define the

658
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:42,720
experience of playing the game.

659
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:44,200
Um, yeah.

660
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:47,040
Fifth Dream in chat says those fucking EMMI.

661
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:47,480
Yes.

662
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:48,160
Very that.

663
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:50,720
SSG100Matt says, it's a very pretty game though.

664
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:51,200
Yes.

665
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:55,720
Um, some are asking for my thoughts on the game because I do love Metroid so much.

666
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:59,760
I just, my, I'm only like 90 minutes in, so I'm, I'm saving more to

667
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:01,800
stream maybe one more, uh, next week.

668
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:08,680
But I don't, I wasn't expecting the survival horror thing where you go into

669
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:10,240
certain areas and you're chased by the robot.

670
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:11,600
I kind of wasn't expecting that.

671
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:16,400
So it threw my mindset off because usually I approach Metroid games and

672
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:20,280
Castlevania type games where I'm like, I'm going to explore every nook and

673
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:25,200
cranny of this zone and scan every part of the wall and do this and do that.

674
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:26,520
That's how I approach it.

675
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:28,680
But I can't do that in Metroid Dread.

676
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:33,320
Now, once you defeat the EMMI in an area, you can go back and you can be a little

677
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:35,520
more, but it just kind of threw off my rhythm, I guess.

678
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:37,360
So I just was a little surprised.

679
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:40,120
So, uh, I think the jury is still out a little bit.

680
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:44,920
I am going to give one pretty big criticism of the game that I, I just

681
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:49,200
don't like it, and that is the fact that some of the, and it's interesting because

682
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:52,760
I've seen the game dragged on Twitter a little bit for accessibility reasons

683
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:56,320
because of this, I wasn't even really thinking of that, but wow.

684
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:56,840
Yes.

685
00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:00,800
Um, and that is that some of the controls are too much.

686
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:02,000
It's too much.

687
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:06,360
And what I mean by that is that like, okay, you kill the boss, you get the

688
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:13,680
cannon, now you have to like hold R and blast with Y and then hit this button to

689
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:16,800
do it's like, you're hitting all these buttons in a weird rhythm that doesn't

690
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:17,480
really make sense.

691
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:21,000
And I, I just, uh, Jamie, I see you talking, but you're muted.

692
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:22,760
What are you saying?

693
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:26,240
I was going to say, how many fingers do they think you have?

694
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:28,800
I, I, it just felt weird.

695
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:33,800
It doesn't feel natural and it feels needlessly complicated for a game where

696
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:37,920
I'm used to, Oh, you just hit select to toggle between missiles, super missile,

697
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:38,400
whatever.

698
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:41,960
Um, and so I, I don't love that.

699
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:44,520
Um, I think it makes those robots.

700
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:49,200
Artificially difficult to kill and I don't think it needs that.

701
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:51,840
So that's, that's my kind of thing with that.

702
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:57,360
Um, fifth dream says hold five buttons, turn the analog stick, hold X and fire.

703
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:57,720
Yes.

704
00:34:57,720 --> 00:35:01,600
It's very that, and I'm not loving that controls on top of that.

705
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:01,920
Yeah.

706
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:02,360
Right.

707
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:03,000
Yeah.

708
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:09,280
So I just think that could be simplified and, you know, whereas I am easily able to

709
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:12,240
move my hands and I have motor skills and all that stuff.

710
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:15,200
Uh, not everybody is as fortunate.

711
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:19,360
And so I just think even for that reason, Nintendo ought to look at how can this

712
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:21,120
process maybe be a little easier?

713
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:23,320
DJ Roma S says, how far into the game are you?

714
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:24,600
Only about 90 minutes.

715
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:28,640
I got, so the first Emmy is a gimme, like you hardly do anything, right?

716
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:29,280
That one's a gimme.

717
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:30,040
I got past that.

718
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:33,600
We did that whole second area with the second Emmy and I killed that Emmy.

719
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:37,880
I got up to seeing the third Emmy, the green one, and then that's where we

720
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:38,640
stopped on the stream.

721
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:40,520
And that was about 90 minutes, maybe a little more.

722
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:45,480
So, uh, and that was a couple of boss fights with that as well and all that

723
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:45,960
good stuff.

724
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:48,280
Um, yeah.

725
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:51,880
Tiger class says it's one of those things you see in games where there's something

726
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:54,560
following you that is an instant kill if you try to combat it.

727
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:56,040
And the only way is to get away from it.

728
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:58,280
Yes, that is, that is what that mechanic is.

729
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:02,560
And it's, uh, it was just a little bit jarring anyway, but I'm, I'm enjoying it

730
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:04,040
and graphically it looks really good.

731
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:06,800
And so since I said something negative, let me say something really positive

732
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:07,520
because I do believe this.

733
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:12,680
I love how the game transitions from like the 2D running scenes and like you blast

734
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:16,280
the door and then all of a sudden, bam, cut scene, but it's seamless.

735
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:18,080
Like there's no loading time.

736
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:21,120
It's just like you run through the door and now it's, and now, and then after the

737
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:25,040
cut scene, the camera just spins around and bam, you're back in the 2D mode.

738
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:25,720
Seamless.

739
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:29,400
Like, I think the way graphically, it does a lot of those tricks.

740
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:30,440
Really cool.

741
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:37,280
So it's, um, it's, it's neat that it's a 2D game, but it is not afraid to show off

742
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:42,320
3D in the environment because they do a lot of like, uh, checks to prime.

743
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:46,200
Like you're never playing Metroid prime, but in some of those cut scenes, you're

744
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:49,160
seeing through Samus's helmet, like it's Metroid prime.

745
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:52,120
And I think that's neat how they kind of incorporate that in there.

746
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:55,080
Uh, Tiger class says, so it's more than one Emmy.

747
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:56,560
It's not just one that follows you around.

748
00:36:56,760 --> 00:37:00,560
There are seven that is mentioned early on in the story in the first 10 minutes.

749
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:01,600
So it's not really a spoiler.

750
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:02,440
There are seven.

751
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:06,960
Um, but, um, they all are very similar in what they do.

752
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:08,920
Um, so there is that.

753
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:12,360
Uh, Crystal wasn't very impressed with it though.

754
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:13,680
Oh, interesting.

755
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:15,120
Crystal was watching my stream.

756
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:19,560
Did, did, did Crystal end up getting the game in the mail, I guess later that night?

757
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:21,000
Um, hold on.

758
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:22,720
It might be a different crystal we're thinking of.

759
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:24,080
Oh, okay.

760
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:27,320
I'm thinking of the crystal that used to live here that I gave my Xbox or sold my

761
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:28,800
Xbox to that it's in the Bay area now.

762
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:31,680
Um, that's actually how I was thinking of.

763
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:32,320
Oh, okay.

764
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:32,680
Yeah.

765
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:35,640
So I'd have to find the comments on Twitter.

766
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:36,360
Okay.

767
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:37,360
I'd be curious.

768
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:42,240
Um, yeah, I, I know it's, I know it's hitting with some mixed results and even

769
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:44,800
I'm kind of like, I like it.

770
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:51,720
I don't know if I love it because they really changed the formula and I, I don't.

771
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:53,680
It just sits okay with me.

772
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:55,000
That's where I'm at right now.

773
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:58,600
But I want, I want to give the game more than 90 minutes before I say this

774
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:00,400
definitive kind of thing on it.

775
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:02,160
So, all right.

776
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:05,320
Um, let's see other games.

777
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:07,280
Yeah, I do.

778
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:08,560
Oh, I almost thought I found it.

779
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:09,160
Nevermind.

780
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:12,160
Um, I'll, I'll find it later.

781
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:12,760
Oh yeah, here we go.

782
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:14,400
Was really hyped for Metroid Dread.

783
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:15,120
Then I played it.

784
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:18,800
If I wanted a game this cheap, I would just play a Souls game.

785
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,040
Not having any fun at all.

786
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:22,120
It's pretty, but it's not doing anything for me.

787
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:22,560
Yep.

788
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:25,440
So, and that's, that's, I can read right into that.

789
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:29,520
It's the Emmy mechanic that people are not necessarily enjoying and it is a

790
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:33,920
different mindset and that's my biggest, that can, that could also be a big win

791
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:39,760
for some people that is really fun for some people, um, that are, especially if

792
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:42,440
you are into those Souls types of games and stuff, that's going to be a big win

793
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:45,520
for you, but, you know, I, I don't know if it is that way for everybody.

794
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:48,600
Um, Tiger Claw on chat says, you know, speed runners will find

795
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:49,960
ways to kill the Emmys faster.

796
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:50,520
Oh, no doubt.

797
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:52,920
Speed runners are already having a field day with Dread.

798
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:56,440
I'm sure Metroid Dread absolutely will be it.

799
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:59,920
Well, I shouldn't, it'll be in a future games done quick.

800
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:03,240
I don't want to say the next one, maybe the one after that, but you absolutely

801
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:07,720
will see Metroid Dread, uh, in a speed run and then not that distant future.

802
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:09,360
And it'll be fascinating to watch.

803
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:10,200
It will.

804
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:14,080
I actually, yes, I'd be very fascinated to see what they do with the Emmys

805
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:14,920
and that whole type of thing.

806
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:16,240
I'm actually looking forward to that.

807
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:17,680
Uh, Bobby points out.

808
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:20,400
It can't be an awesome games done quick cause they close those submissions.

809
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:20,960
Weeks ago.

810
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:24,680
Well, that's why I didn't want to, I chose my words carefully there.

811
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:26,240
Cause I was like, maybe the summer one.

812
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:27,040
All right.

813
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:29,720
Other games I played this week.

814
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:31,280
One I'm going to say really fast.

815
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:33,600
So I mentioned I was going to buy this game, but I was

816
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:34,520
going to buy it a little late.

817
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:37,360
So I finally did pick up Diablo two resurrected.

818
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:39,360
Haven't played a lot of it.

819
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:44,880
Um, but I love the feature where you can toggle between the old graphics and the

820
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:48,640
new graphics by just hitting like the letter G you flip between the two graphics.

821
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:53,240
Because when I go back to the old graphics and how often we do, we do this

822
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:58,280
with retro games, sometimes I go back to the old graphics and I go, damn, it

823
00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:03,040
looked that blocky, I don't remember that, but you have to remember we weren't

824
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:07,160
playing Diablo two on high definition televisions, essentially, or monitors.

825
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:11,240
Back in, you know, the day when that game was first out, we were playing

826
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:16,080
on those giant CRT monitors that actually, if you had a 15 inch monitor,

827
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:17,680
you were lucky, you know what I mean?

828
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:23,920
Uh, and yeah, so now, you know, on these big 24 inch, 27 inch HD TVs,

829
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:26,560
um, it looks very blocky.

830
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:30,520
Fifth dream in chat says toggling is the only way I can even

831
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:32,240
tell they updated the graphics.

832
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:34,400
It feels the same if you never switch.

833
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:38,760
Yeah, the game still feels the same for better and for worse.

834
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:42,440
So like I spent hours and hours and hours in Diablo three.

835
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:47,600
And so I'm not used to this whole fucking like, and I knew this was

836
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:50,080
a thing and I remember this was the thing, but I'm not used to like

837
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:52,560
your inventory fills up in 10 seconds.

838
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:56,280
And you better have like a thousand town portals to go back and sell things.

839
00:40:56,600 --> 00:41:00,480
They got rid of that in Diablo three.

840
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:03,520
So, and Bobby does remind us games.

841
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:07,480
Weren't as blocky on CRTs just because of the way CRTs work.

842
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:08,480
Yes, very that.

843
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:11,840
So it was, uh, it was very different, but anyway, that's not a read on it's

844
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:14,520
just, it's one of those things I appreciate the graphics look for.

845
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:18,360
I mean, it is Diablo two with better graphics.

846
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:23,400
This is the game most people asked for when they said I want them to

847
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:25,880
remake Diablo two, but don't fucking change it.

848
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:27,360
Don't make a deal.

849
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:28,000
Okay.

850
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:31,400
You got your wish for better and for worse.

851
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:32,040
Okay.

852
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:33,000
That's all I'm saying.

853
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:35,880
Uh, I think that's enough of my human week.

854
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:39,720
I, I, you know, the usual stuff dead by daylight, I had the sweatiest

855
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:43,560
survivors today I was playing against, but it's, it's because I'm getting

856
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:47,360
better with Wraith, so I know I'm moving up into MMR and I play

857
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:48,680
a sweaty fucking Wraith.

858
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:49,120
Okay.

859
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:50,920
No ed devour.

860
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:52,240
It's all on the table.

861
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:53,000
I don't give a fuck.

862
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:53,880
Don't rely on that.

863
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:54,920
No ed Rob.

864
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:56,840
I, I couldn't today.

865
00:41:56,880 --> 00:42:00,960
Cause again, sometimes, you know, you just get some maps and the totems

866
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,320
like spawn on the survivors ball sacks.

867
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:05,360
Like it just spawns that fast.

868
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:06,920
Like, and so what are you going to do?

869
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:07,800
What we're talking about?

870
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:08,880
It's okay.

871
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:14,720
So in dead by daylight, killers have the ability to have perks that

872
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:16,480
will spawn on what's called totems.

873
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:18,800
Totems are in random places on the map.

874
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:22,400
If the survivor spends five seconds or so cleansing a totem,

875
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:23,920
they get rid of your ability.

876
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:28,200
Some maps, such as the Hawkins laboratory, that's going away in

877
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:30,760
November, have pretty good totem spawn points.

878
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:32,640
They're hard to find the totems on those maps.

879
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:37,960
Some maps like, uh, the pen asylum I was playing this match on, you

880
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:41,960
have the potential to spawn a totem right next to a generator.

881
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:44,960
So as the survivors are doing their thing, they're going to see it.

882
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:49,560
So anyway, you know, please, I realized we'd go off the deep end with dead

883
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:51,880
by daylight chat sometimes cause dark soccer and I play so much.

884
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:53,640
I just didn't know what you meant by sweaty players.

885
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:55,880
I was like, I have no idea what that's referencing.

886
00:42:56,320 --> 00:43:00,880
Um, sweaty players means two of them brought flashlights and the other one

887
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:05,040
had a flash bang and they made it their job to make sure I could hook nobody.

888
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:06,320
Oh, got it.

889
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:08,320
To sweat is to put effort into something.

890
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:08,960
Yeah.

891
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:09,400
Got it.

892
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:12,160
And if you're really sweating about it, you're really putting a lot of effort.

893
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:14,240
If I'm asking questions about stuff, I'm old now.

894
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:16,400
I don't like that.

895
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:18,480
I'm older than you and I play this game.

896
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:22,480
They weren't sweating to do the game mechanics of repair five

897
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:23,640
generators and get out the door.

898
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:27,520
They were sweating to make my life miserable as the killer.

899
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:28,640
It was a bully match.

900
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:29,120
So that's why I bring no ed.

901
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:29,640
What?

902
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:33,440
Well, they, they were being efficient.

903
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:34,560
That's the thing.

904
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:40,080
If you get a good Swift that knows what they're doing, they know how to use their

905
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:45,280
teamwork and they're efficient and you have to sweat, but the really sweaty

906
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:50,880
survivors are the ones who are trying to go the extra route to get the

907
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:55,360
flashlights done, the killer, although I sometimes a lot of, it doesn't take

908
00:43:55,360 --> 00:43:56,720
much to make me sweat anymore.

909
00:43:56,720 --> 00:44:04,440
So just say, well, I, that's kind of why, and I'll, I'll end my part of

910
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:08,200
the DVD stuff after this was kind of why, like, I super love playing pig

911
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:12,080
and Freddy because I always bring whispers.

912
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:15,680
So I have an idea where people are, especially for pig.

913
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:19,600
Like my build right now is, uh, whispers, corrupt intervention.

914
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:22,760
So a half of my generators start off unusable.

915
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:24,680
I'm explaining for, for Loki.

916
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:30,240
Um, the other one I use is, uh, hex ruin.

917
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:35,200
Which means that when someone stops working on a generator, it starts regressing.

918
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:41,880
And then I also though, we'll use pop goes the weasel because when they have

919
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:48,640
killed my, uh, my hex ruin, when they find my totem, I at least can get the

920
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:53,600
generators to start degrading a little bit differently with that one.

921
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:55,840
And it's a perk, not a, not a totem.

922
00:44:56,680 --> 00:45:03,040
So all of those together, I mean, I have a good time with pig pretty much.

923
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:07,760
You're, you're the pig that, um, when, uh, Tay goes into a match

924
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:09,840
and goes, ah, just DC it's a pig.

925
00:45:11,160 --> 00:45:11,520
Yeah.

926
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:13,520
People will DC against, against my pig.

927
00:45:13,960 --> 00:45:15,600
I take that as a badge of honor.

928
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:21,720
I'm actually going to start, uh, running one of those tallies in, in my channel.

929
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:23,560
But Loki DC is disconnect.

930
00:45:23,560 --> 00:45:28,080
And that means that somebody, somebody would rather take a five minute penalty

931
00:45:28,080 --> 00:45:30,880
and waiting for the next game, then finish the game that they signed up for.

932
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:34,360
That's a decent, and I've done it.

933
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:35,560
I've done it as a killer.

934
00:45:35,560 --> 00:45:36,960
I've done it as a survivor.

935
00:45:37,840 --> 00:45:40,200
Sometimes you're just like, I'm not, I'm not having it.

936
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:42,920
Sometimes you will get asshole matches though.

937
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:45,560
You will, you will like absolute bullies, but yeah.

938
00:45:45,600 --> 00:45:45,960
Okay.

939
00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:47,040
All right, let's move on.

940
00:45:47,080 --> 00:45:50,360
Well, a lot of this, of course, we've learned from watching various

941
00:45:50,360 --> 00:45:55,560
Twitch streams and doing things on Twitch and Twitch, once again, in the

942
00:45:55,560 --> 00:45:57,040
news this week, aren't they Loki?

943
00:45:57,640 --> 00:46:02,560
Yes, because Twitch got hacked and what did the hackers take?

944
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:03,560
Yes.

945
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:09,640
Um, so they went, they went in and they, they took all of Twitch, all

946
00:46:09,640 --> 00:46:11,400
of it, every single bit of it.

947
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:16,200
And, um, so now they've got, for example, the source code of Twitch and

948
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:19,760
all of the special, uh, tools that they have, the mobile desktop and video

949
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:24,560
game clients, they now know that there is a unreleased steam competitor

950
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:27,080
called, um, Oh gosh, I don't remember what it's called.

951
00:46:27,080 --> 00:46:27,560
Vapor.

952
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:30,440
It's vapor, very aptly name.

953
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:36,040
Um, basically just all of it.

954
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:41,560
So that's concerning because yeah.

955
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:47,160
Um, that's, they leaked everybody's earnings that, uh, we're

956
00:46:47,160 --> 00:46:48,560
making money on the platform.

957
00:46:49,320 --> 00:46:53,680
Um, well, I guess, I don't know.

958
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:55,760
It's not necessarily like all of the earnings.

959
00:46:55,760 --> 00:46:58,040
It's just the revenue from subscriptions.

960
00:46:58,320 --> 00:47:01,040
And it's also only like the top thousand or something like that.

961
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:04,800
Cause if you search for me or you search for VOG network, you're not

962
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:07,520
going to find it because we don't make that much money on, we do.

963
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:08,920
We search for me.

964
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:10,920
You're gonna find, I make no money because I don't stream.

965
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:14,600
In fact, you, you might be sad and give more money when you

966
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:16,000
see that we're not making any.

967
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:17,200
I'm just, I'm teasing Darcy.

968
00:47:17,240 --> 00:47:18,040
I'm not in it for the money.

969
00:47:18,120 --> 00:47:23,320
Well, there's also, um, uh, I think like everybody had their Twitch keys reset.

970
00:47:23,880 --> 00:47:24,480
Yes.

971
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:27,960
And encouraged to change their passwords, which of course I did all of that.

972
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:28,480
Yeah.

973
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:29,600
I need to do that.

974
00:47:30,920 --> 00:47:32,440
Which is kind of funny.

975
00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:34,960
Here's a funny, uh, behind the scenes story.

976
00:47:35,120 --> 00:47:38,600
So they didn't like, so they reset the, the stream keys, right?

977
00:47:38,600 --> 00:47:43,240
So, um, Bobby, uh, was like, oh, cause we all use separate, uh, stream

978
00:47:43,240 --> 00:47:45,640
keys to do this VOG network thing.

979
00:47:45,640 --> 00:47:48,200
I have my own stream key, but cause you can do that.

980
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:50,240
You can issue out basically like partner keys.

981
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:52,960
That's how a lot of corporate brands allow people to stream to

982
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:54,160
their channels, different people.

983
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:54,640
Right.

984
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:58,240
So, you know, um, so VOG does this, so I have my own key.

985
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:01,960
So, um, Bobby went in this week and reset it.

986
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:05,120
He's like, okay, since they're resetting all the stream keys, here's this.

987
00:48:05,360 --> 00:48:05,960
Have fun.

988
00:48:06,280 --> 00:48:09,440
The day after he does it, we get another email.

989
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:11,520
So they reset everybody's stream keys.

990
00:48:11,840 --> 00:48:12,680
Stream keys.

991
00:48:12,680 --> 00:48:16,560
And then two days later they realized, oh, we have to reset

992
00:48:16,840 --> 00:48:19,760
the, um, delegated stream keys too.

993
00:48:19,880 --> 00:48:21,560
So they reset it again.

994
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:26,360
And Bobby had to send me another key and that wasn't a waste of time or anything,

995
00:48:26,440 --> 00:48:29,600
but just remember now how to find my stream keys, how to go do that.

996
00:48:29,800 --> 00:48:30,040
Yeah.

997
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:30,600
Google it.

998
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:31,160
Yeah.

999
00:48:31,360 --> 00:48:31,560
Yeah.

1000
00:48:31,560 --> 00:48:32,800
How to find your stream key.

1001
00:48:33,080 --> 00:48:33,640
Yeah.

1002
00:48:33,640 --> 00:48:35,000
It's in your profile information.

1003
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:36,080
Yeah, I know.

1004
00:48:36,120 --> 00:48:38,400
It's just, you know, it's a mess.

1005
00:48:38,440 --> 00:48:40,040
How did I sound like such a boomer today?

1006
00:48:40,040 --> 00:48:40,720
I swear to God.

1007
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:42,880
Um, okay.

1008
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:48,400
So outside of that, you know, obviously they, they confirm that yes, they'd been

1009
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:52,800
hacked and, um, they said that full credit card numbers are not still restored by

1010
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:57,000
Twitch, so, uh, those weren't necessarily exposed, but, you know, change of

1011
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:58,120
passwords, all that fun stuff.

1012
00:48:58,280 --> 00:49:03,320
Plus they also got access to the, uh, switch or the Twitch SOC internal red

1013
00:49:03,320 --> 00:49:08,080
teaming tools, which are, you know, different things that they use for.

1014
00:49:08,080 --> 00:49:11,280
Um, I was like developer stuff.

1015
00:49:11,320 --> 00:49:16,520
Um, so yeah, so like, you know, how we have this whole body problem.

1016
00:49:16,560 --> 00:49:18,080
Well, I think it's going to get worse.

1017
00:49:19,080 --> 00:49:20,160
So that that's good.

1018
00:49:20,520 --> 00:49:25,360
Um, and then on top of that, just to scare you a little bit more that,

1019
00:49:25,360 --> 00:49:27,400
Hey, it may not be over yet.

1020
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:32,120
Um, they've been taking Jeff Bezos picture, a really horrible picture

1021
00:49:32,120 --> 00:49:36,720
of him and kind of pacing the background of different game categories.

1022
00:49:37,080 --> 00:49:40,960
So if you look at some of the different games, you may have seen Jeff Bezos

1023
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:46,960
face kind of, uh, slowly peeking out as if some Halloween specter looking

1024
00:49:47,480 --> 00:49:49,960
behind the game, like Michael Myers, right?

1025
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,240
That's freaking frightening that kind of thing.

1026
00:49:52,280 --> 00:49:58,800
So, uh, that's, that's reassuring that that's still happening now after it's

1027
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:02,400
been hacked that, you know, somehow they're able to do that.

1028
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:03,760
So do they still have access?

1029
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:04,640
What's going on?

1030
00:50:04,680 --> 00:50:05,920
Like, do we even know?

1031
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:07,200
I don't know.

1032
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:11,520
So I guess we're at the wait and find out what happens from all of

1033
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:14,400
this, because that's not great.

1034
00:50:14,760 --> 00:50:15,960
It's not a great place to be in.

1035
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:17,280
No, it is not great.

1036
00:50:17,360 --> 00:50:22,240
Um, and there's supposedly like, there's like a part two that's coming

1037
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:23,800
at some point or something, right?

1038
00:50:23,840 --> 00:50:24,280
Yes.

1039
00:50:24,280 --> 00:50:24,600
Yes.

1040
00:50:24,600 --> 00:50:26,760
Because there's 125 gigabytes for the dump.

1041
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:28,480
They, they call it part one.

1042
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:31,840
So it's, there may be more coming.

1043
00:50:31,840 --> 00:50:32,320
Who knows?

1044
00:50:32,320 --> 00:50:36,160
The part I'm trying to wrap my head around is that the impression I was

1045
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:40,160
getting from some of what they were releasing, I felt like they were trying

1046
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:44,640
to come off as like an ethical hacker, which is a hard thing to do when

1047
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:46,160
you're posting things to 4chan.

1048
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:47,640
Um, sorry, not sorry.

1049
00:50:47,640 --> 00:50:47,960
Right.

1050
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:53,640
Also like, you know, you are divulging people's incomes, which I guess if

1051
00:50:53,640 --> 00:50:57,720
you're trying to take the Robin hood, you know, F the top percent or whatever,

1052
00:50:57,960 --> 00:51:01,560
then I guess I can let that slide a little bit, but it's, it's supposed

1053
00:51:01,560 --> 00:51:03,120
to be an ethical hack or no.

1054
00:51:03,800 --> 00:51:06,600
Like, I, I don't understand what the point of calling people's incomes

1055
00:51:06,600 --> 00:51:10,800
at, cause like, yeah, people, they, you know, they work for that kind of stuff.

1056
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:14,240
You have like folks like Hassan or whatever that like stream, like seven

1057
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:18,120
days a week, I mean, you have lots of people and they stream for like 10

1058
00:51:18,120 --> 00:51:22,360
hours a day, like, dude, that's more hours in it for their work that they're

1059
00:51:22,360 --> 00:51:24,000
putting in than I'm putting in for my work.

1060
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:28,000
Like, yeah, I think that they deserve the money that they get.

1061
00:51:28,040 --> 00:51:32,640
It's listen, we're not holding guns to people's heads to force them to

1062
00:51:32,680 --> 00:51:35,680
subscribe to these people, people subscribe because they want to support them.

1063
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:38,440
So like, I don't see where the downside is there.

1064
00:51:39,640 --> 00:51:40,520
No, but that's seriously.

1065
00:51:40,520 --> 00:51:42,560
The thing is it is their job.

1066
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:44,800
It is what they do for a living.

1067
00:51:44,840 --> 00:51:50,880
It is not always fun, you know, but it's what they do for a living.

1068
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:56,520
It'd be like someone went to my job, published my job and my salary, which

1069
00:51:56,600 --> 00:51:59,640
I mean, I kind of don't care, but personally, I mean, I care if people

1070
00:51:59,640 --> 00:52:01,800
know where I work, but you know what I mean, going back to my point.

1071
00:52:02,840 --> 00:52:08,200
It's not, it's, there's nothing ethical about it.

1072
00:52:08,560 --> 00:52:10,800
They did it for E-peen.

1073
00:52:11,080 --> 00:52:15,240
There was a very interesting response by Pokimane, one of the streamers

1074
00:52:15,240 --> 00:52:16,800
that's on that top, top 100.

1075
00:52:16,920 --> 00:52:18,440
She does very well for herself, obviously.

1076
00:52:18,440 --> 00:52:21,360
And she, she was, uh, very, uh, very much in the limelight recently.

1077
00:52:21,360 --> 00:52:26,280
Cause she, she helped AOC, the Congresswoman do her stream when she was doing

1078
00:52:26,280 --> 00:52:30,360
Among Us, um, during the last election cycle, um, Pokimane had a very interesting

1079
00:52:30,360 --> 00:52:31,240
response to the whole thing.

1080
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:35,600
She kind of said, well, now, you know why I limit the amount that people can donate.

1081
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:39,000
Um, and I thought that was an interesting take on it is she was kind of like, I

1082
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:39,600
got the impression of that.

1083
00:52:39,600 --> 00:52:41,440
She's like, I know I make a lot of money doing this.

1084
00:52:41,600 --> 00:52:42,560
I don't need to make more.

1085
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:46,680
Cause she, she also was, she addressed like a sponsorships and things of that

1086
00:52:46,680 --> 00:52:51,320
nature that aren't captured by that list, which, um, I just thought it was interesting.

1087
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:55,160
Uh, speaking of interesting, this comment in our chat over at twitch.tv slash

1088
00:52:55,160 --> 00:52:59,920
vlog network, um, some, a couple of people wondering, could this have been an inside

1089
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:05,240
job, uh, DJ Rama S says, I think it was an inside job, third party, critical myth

1090
00:53:05,240 --> 00:53:07,360
says, definitely seems like an inside job to me.

1091
00:53:07,400 --> 00:53:07,840
What were you saying?

1092
00:53:07,840 --> 00:53:08,120
Loki?

1093
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:12,840
I was going to say Twitch said it was a third party that did it so far.

1094
00:53:12,840 --> 00:53:15,200
They haven't figured out that it's a internal.

1095
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:19,120
See sometimes though, Loki, it's all in the words because technically, and I don't

1096
00:53:19,120 --> 00:53:21,360
mean to, you know, get my tinfoil party.

1097
00:53:21,480 --> 00:53:24,600
Technically, if you don't work for Twitch anymore, but you took something on your

1098
00:53:24,600 --> 00:53:25,960
way out the door, you're a third party.

1099
00:53:25,960 --> 00:53:27,040
Cause you don't work for him anymore.

1100
00:53:27,560 --> 00:53:30,400
I like how they called it a Twitch security incident.

1101
00:53:31,240 --> 00:53:31,600
Dude.

1102
00:53:31,600 --> 00:53:32,280
Come on.

1103
00:53:33,560 --> 00:53:39,000
Uh, DJ Rama S says, and now people are salty because so much streamers are making bank.

1104
00:53:39,560 --> 00:53:43,280
Wait until I tell you how much people in Hollywood are making.

1105
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:47,920
Just, just you wait, you know, did you go see that new Bond movie this weekend?

1106
00:53:48,040 --> 00:53:50,080
Do you know how much Daniel Craig made for that?

1107
00:53:50,080 --> 00:53:51,880
Just wait until I tell you.

1108
00:53:51,880 --> 00:53:55,680
I can understand the continuing with the comment Rama says, I can understand because

1109
00:53:55,680 --> 00:54:00,360
some streamers throw that in your face, so fuck them, but overall, if you're salty,

1110
00:54:00,360 --> 00:54:03,240
the streamers are making more money than you, then it's a personal issue to you.

1111
00:54:03,640 --> 00:54:07,120
Uh, and the tiger class says, some will see those earnings and think they should

1112
00:54:07,120 --> 00:54:08,520
probably get into Twitch.

1113
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:13,720
Well, I I'm all for enabling more people to get on Twitch because Twitch is a

1114
00:54:13,720 --> 00:54:20,200
platform, use the platform and there's, if, if you looked at that list, I think

1115
00:54:20,200 --> 00:54:24,200
if you looked at that list, you're going to notice there was very much a trend

1116
00:54:24,360 --> 00:54:27,040
within the top a hundred top 500 streamers.

1117
00:54:27,600 --> 00:54:32,800
There was a very much a trend in what all those people look like and what

1118
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:34,440
gender they are and so forth.

1119
00:54:34,520 --> 00:54:35,080
Sure.

1120
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:38,880
There's exceptions in there, but for the most part, does, do those exceptions

1121
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:41,240
match the exceptions in the population?

1122
00:54:42,200 --> 00:54:43,680
No, no.

1123
00:54:44,440 --> 00:54:50,760
So, yes, we need more people to get on Twitch, but are they going to want

1124
00:54:50,760 --> 00:54:52,120
to do that after this happened?

1125
00:54:52,160 --> 00:54:52,640
Doubt it.

1126
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:55,240
Anyway.

1127
00:54:55,480 --> 00:54:55,800
All right.

1128
00:54:55,840 --> 00:55:01,240
Uh, anything else you want to say on this before I move to the next, uh, I almost

1129
00:55:01,240 --> 00:55:02,640
want to read your comment on Arama.

1130
00:55:02,680 --> 00:55:04,960
I'm not going to, but I'm just going to acknowledge it because you're talking

1131
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:08,920
about your day job and I'm just kind of winking at you, you know, you know, um,

1132
00:55:09,400 --> 00:55:11,760
anything else you want to say, Loki, before we go to the next story?

1133
00:55:12,040 --> 00:55:12,920
No, I'm good.

1134
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:18,800
Then let's go to talking about Konami, uh, an old favorite here, uh, you know, back

1135
00:55:18,800 --> 00:55:23,680
in the day, not, you know, the Konami that publishes E-Football, but the old Konami

1136
00:55:23,680 --> 00:55:24,400
of yesteryear.

1137
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:28,480
So of course, when we talk about retro Konami, this sort of thing really

1138
00:55:28,480 --> 00:55:30,200
tugs at our heartstrings.

1139
00:55:30,440 --> 00:55:34,200
Konami announced a contest, and this was right around the time we were doing our

1140
00:55:34,200 --> 00:55:37,840
show last week, so it missed the cutoff last week, but they announced a contest

1141
00:55:37,840 --> 00:55:43,800
where indie developers can create brand new games based on the, uh, portfolio of

1142
00:55:43,800 --> 00:55:48,560
brands and classic IPs, not everything, but there's a pretty good, a pretty good

1143
00:55:48,560 --> 00:55:53,480
chunk of, uh, quote unquote, forgotten Konami IPs is on this list, not on the

1144
00:55:53,480 --> 00:55:53,840
list.

1145
00:55:53,840 --> 00:55:56,800
Castlevania, not on the list, Suikoden or Silent Hill.

1146
00:55:57,040 --> 00:55:57,440
Yes.

1147
00:55:57,440 --> 00:56:02,320
On the list, Jairus, Goemon, uh, Yer Kong Fu, I think is on the list too.

1148
00:56:02,440 --> 00:56:03,480
There's a lot of stuff on there.

1149
00:56:03,800 --> 00:56:09,520
So, um, whoever wins this contest could get a nice check and potentially some game

1150
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:09,960
sales.

1151
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:14,320
This is a contest being held in collaboration with the Shueisha Game

1152
00:56:14,320 --> 00:56:15,240
Developers Camp.

1153
00:56:15,360 --> 00:56:21,360
So before January 6, 2022, based upon one of these 80 brands, uh, maybe Darsak will

1154
00:56:21,360 --> 00:56:24,720
get a new Twinbee out of this cause that's on the list, uh, and so forth.

1155
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:29,880
Uh, so once you make one of the games based on these brands, then Konami is going to

1156
00:56:29,880 --> 00:56:33,560
judge them and the grand prize winner will get 2 million yen.

1157
00:56:33,560 --> 00:56:35,800
That's about $18,000 in US dollars.

1158
00:56:36,080 --> 00:56:42,360
Uh, but if Konami wants to actually see one of those games come out, they will help

1159
00:56:42,360 --> 00:56:44,440
the studio develop and release the game.

1160
00:56:44,640 --> 00:56:50,360
That could be up to 30 million or the equivalent of $270,000 to develop,

1161
00:56:50,360 --> 00:56:51,960
supervise and so forth.

1162
00:56:52,240 --> 00:56:54,120
Um, that's pretty neat.

1163
00:56:54,360 --> 00:56:59,760
Now, I posted about this on Twitter after last week's show, and I got a response from

1164
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:02,080
one of our listeners that I really thought was worth reading.

1165
00:57:02,760 --> 00:57:06,880
And this was from, uh, 13X Forever who comments a lot in Discord, but I think

1166
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:09,240
because of time zones isn't really here live usually.

1167
00:57:09,720 --> 00:57:16,120
And the, uh, response I got was from 13X Forever was, do they compensate the time

1168
00:57:16,120 --> 00:57:18,360
spent on this for every contestant?

1169
00:57:18,680 --> 00:57:21,600
Do contestants retain the rights on the prototypes they submit?

1170
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:23,960
I guess the answer is no and no.

1171
00:57:24,280 --> 00:57:30,160
So basically it's the usual con to exploit over enthusiastic indie devs to give them

1172
00:57:30,160 --> 00:57:32,400
a bunch of new ideas for pennies.

1173
00:57:34,040 --> 00:57:38,080
As much as that's a cynical perspective, I think it's a fair one, uh, in this, is

1174
00:57:38,080 --> 00:57:40,800
that, yeah, not every game is going to get picked.

1175
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:45,960
Could you run into this situation where Konami suddenly puts out their own thing

1176
00:57:45,960 --> 00:57:51,320
and it's like, oh, this looks like a lot like the indie developed thing that they

1177
00:57:51,320 --> 00:57:52,280
could run into that.

1178
00:57:52,760 --> 00:57:58,920
Still, still, I feel like there's a way Y Y R could reskin pixel

1179
00:57:58,920 --> 00:58:00,240
poops into a Konami brand.

1180
00:58:02,520 --> 00:58:04,560
Call it a pro Evo soccer.

1181
00:58:07,240 --> 00:58:08,600
That's that pro Evo pooper.

1182
00:58:11,480 --> 00:58:13,560
You better watch out or there's going to be a cheat code.

1183
00:58:13,560 --> 00:58:16,320
That's going to make the main character wear a soccer Jersey.

1184
00:58:18,560 --> 00:58:20,240
We can really have pro Evo pooper.

1185
00:58:20,280 --> 00:58:24,480
Just turn the people that run across in, in the park into soccer players.

1186
00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:24,920
There you go.

1187
00:58:25,040 --> 00:58:25,400
Done.

1188
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:31,080
Y Y R has, Y Y R has a wife, a child, a job.

1189
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:34,680
I don't think Y Y R is going to enter this contest, but I think of people like Y Y R

1190
00:58:34,680 --> 00:58:39,200
and so forth that maybe do want to make a big thing and you know, it could, there

1191
00:58:39,200 --> 00:58:44,000
could be a nice thing that develops from this is that, you know, you could maybe,

1192
00:58:44,280 --> 00:58:49,360
you know, get your foot in the door with the industry, uh, having this beat could

1193
00:58:49,360 --> 00:58:49,920
be a big thing.

1194
00:58:50,920 --> 00:58:53,760
That's the same thing as working for exposure, Rob.

1195
00:58:54,120 --> 00:58:55,480
And you know what I say about that.

1196
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:59,200
Farron, people die of exposure.

1197
00:58:59,240 --> 00:59:02,280
Isn't that what a lot of, isn't that what a lot of indie

1198
00:59:02,280 --> 00:59:03,520
developers are doing anyway?

1199
00:59:07,760 --> 00:59:09,520
Not, I mean, what are we doing?

1200
00:59:10,560 --> 00:59:13,320
Well, we're doing it for, I reiterate, we're not on the list.

1201
00:59:13,360 --> 00:59:13,600
You're right.

1202
00:59:13,600 --> 00:59:14,520
We're doing it for, right.

1203
00:59:14,560 --> 00:59:15,440
We're doing it for fun.

1204
00:59:16,080 --> 00:59:16,720
There you go.

1205
00:59:16,800 --> 00:59:17,320
That's it.

1206
00:59:17,480 --> 00:59:19,280
Don't do this unless it's going to be fun.

1207
00:59:19,440 --> 00:59:22,560
Because the cynical side of that and all that, you know, very, you know,

1208
00:59:22,560 --> 00:59:24,840
and I say cynical, but I don't, I don't mean it in a negative way.

1209
00:59:24,840 --> 00:59:26,920
It's a very realistic perspective and so forth.

1210
00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:29,320
So yes, keep that in the back of your mind.

1211
00:59:29,320 --> 00:59:32,200
But if you're sitting there going, it might be kind of fun to make a gyrus

1212
00:59:32,200 --> 00:59:33,680
game, just, just to see what happens.

1213
00:59:34,040 --> 00:59:36,360
Like Loki, you're a game maker now.

1214
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:37,520
You want to enter the contest?

1215
00:59:38,080 --> 00:59:38,520
No.

1216
00:59:38,840 --> 00:59:39,200
Okay.

1217
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:40,120
Well then it's not fun.

1218
00:59:41,800 --> 00:59:45,720
I don't, I don't want to make any new games for there.

1219
00:59:45,760 --> 00:59:47,840
Well, I mean, a new Contra game would be awesome.

1220
00:59:48,360 --> 00:59:51,360
See, now we're going, I don't know if that was on the list though, but it

1221
00:59:51,360 --> 00:59:55,120
wasn't probably, you know, cause they're, they're too busy ruining their own

1222
00:59:55,120 --> 00:59:59,720
franchises, you know, they need other people to make, you know, all right.

1223
00:59:59,720 --> 01:00:04,120
I'm looking at that enough that we exist in a world that there's a Frogger TV

1224
01:00:04,120 --> 01:00:06,840
show that is blasphemy as it is.

1225
01:00:06,880 --> 01:00:11,600
I don't care how removed far removed it is from the actual Frogger game.

1226
01:00:11,880 --> 01:00:13,040
It's blasphemy.

1227
01:00:13,080 --> 01:00:13,600
Okay.

1228
01:00:14,240 --> 01:00:16,640
Blasphemy bless for you.

1229
01:00:16,640 --> 01:00:17,720
I laughed so hard.

1230
01:00:17,720 --> 01:00:19,200
My earpiece just fell out.

1231
01:00:20,280 --> 01:00:21,040
That's not good.

1232
01:00:21,520 --> 01:00:21,920
All right.

1233
01:00:23,280 --> 01:00:23,680
Anyway.

1234
01:00:23,680 --> 01:00:24,000
All right.

1235
01:00:24,040 --> 01:00:28,200
Uh, I'm also looking at chat and people are just going E-poop ball,

1236
01:00:28,240 --> 01:00:30,800
uh, pixelvania, soccer shits.

1237
01:00:30,840 --> 01:00:32,760
They're just, they're just going crazy.

1238
01:00:33,040 --> 01:00:34,520
Uh, soccer shits.

1239
01:00:34,600 --> 01:00:37,120
Fifth dream in chat says Russian attack.

1240
01:00:37,120 --> 01:00:37,320
Oops.

1241
01:00:37,320 --> 01:00:38,760
I thought I was in a Google window.

1242
01:00:39,960 --> 01:00:42,480
They remade Russian attack not that long ago.

1243
01:00:42,600 --> 01:00:43,600
It wasn't very good.

1244
01:00:43,600 --> 01:00:45,200
Xbox 360 arcade thing.

1245
01:00:45,680 --> 01:00:47,480
Where it was just the old arcade game with new graphics.

1246
01:00:47,560 --> 01:00:48,120
Yeah, it was all right.

1247
01:00:48,600 --> 01:00:53,360
It wasn't, I think they changed up some stuff, but yeah, it wasn't all Kate.

1248
01:00:53,640 --> 01:00:54,880
And orange, right?

1249
01:00:54,880 --> 01:00:56,520
Says poop and attack.

1250
01:00:56,800 --> 01:00:57,360
Oh my God.

1251
01:00:57,400 --> 01:00:58,040
That's it.

1252
01:00:58,240 --> 01:00:58,600
That's it.

1253
01:00:58,600 --> 01:00:59,040
Oh my God.

1254
01:00:59,040 --> 01:00:59,520
That's it.

1255
01:00:59,680 --> 01:01:00,200
Loki.

1256
01:01:00,200 --> 01:01:03,520
Just brand your game, poop and attack and see what happens.

1257
01:01:04,880 --> 01:01:05,800
Oh, Frogger.

1258
01:01:07,520 --> 01:01:08,040
All right.

1259
01:01:08,160 --> 01:01:12,560
Moving on for those pooper, for those newer to orange launch radio, who don't

1260
01:01:12,600 --> 01:01:15,000
maybe understand the joke, uh, there was a

1261
01:01:15,040 --> 01:01:16,800
we're five years old and like poop jokes.

1262
01:01:16,920 --> 01:01:21,160
Basically, namely dark Sakura, uh, said.

1263
01:01:21,720 --> 01:01:22,920
Got years ago.

1264
01:01:22,960 --> 01:01:24,920
Like we have this list of dream games.

1265
01:01:25,040 --> 01:01:28,120
Suddenly we'll be on a tangent train and we'll say, Hey, this game should exist.

1266
01:01:28,320 --> 01:01:30,960
And dark Sakura came up with this idea for pixel shits.

1267
01:01:30,960 --> 01:01:33,320
And it was just about, I don't know, I guess it was about shitting on things.

1268
01:01:33,520 --> 01:01:36,800
Anyway, one of our listeners even come up with that because I'm stupid.

1269
01:01:36,840 --> 01:01:38,320
I don't even know.

1270
01:01:38,320 --> 01:01:39,400
We'll have to go back to the archive.

1271
01:01:39,400 --> 01:01:40,480
I don't even remember what episode it was on.

1272
01:01:40,880 --> 01:01:41,560
Anyway, why?

1273
01:01:41,560 --> 01:01:45,200
Why are one of our listeners and a great indie game maker?

1274
01:01:45,200 --> 01:01:45,440
Why?

1275
01:01:45,440 --> 01:01:46,720
Why are games.com?

1276
01:01:46,720 --> 01:01:47,960
I hope I got his website right.

1277
01:01:47,960 --> 01:01:51,280
I who's made a lot of great games, made that game into a reality.

1278
01:01:51,480 --> 01:01:57,040
Then in in a moment of, wow, how how recursive can things get here?

1279
01:01:57,240 --> 01:02:01,880
Loki goes and makes a sequel pixel poops number two.

1280
01:02:03,440 --> 01:02:06,720
So if if you're wondering why are we sitting here talking about pixel

1281
01:02:06,760 --> 01:02:11,400
shits all night, because it is a indie indie game, we sort of started that like

1282
01:02:11,600 --> 01:02:13,840
is an actual thing you can get on itch.io and steam.

1283
01:02:14,040 --> 01:02:16,200
So check it out if you haven't already.

1284
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:18,640
All right, let's move on.

1285
01:02:18,840 --> 01:02:21,000
I don't even know what I'm on anymore, Rob.

1286
01:02:21,200 --> 01:02:24,120
Let's talk about other things that took a big shit this week.

1287
01:02:24,320 --> 01:02:27,200
Dark Sakura, I laughed my ass off.

1288
01:02:27,400 --> 01:02:30,200
This was funny. I did because I didn't get affected at all.

1289
01:02:30,400 --> 01:02:31,520
This was great news.

1290
01:02:31,720 --> 01:02:33,760
I had a great morning this morning.

1291
01:02:33,960 --> 01:02:34,920
Oh, gosh.

1292
01:02:35,080 --> 01:02:38,480
So Facebook,

1293
01:02:38,680 --> 01:02:43,720
the thing I have successfully extracted myself mostly from.

1294
01:02:43,920 --> 01:02:45,400
Um.

1295
01:02:45,600 --> 01:02:52,040
Went down, it went down, it went down hard, not just that, Instagram, WhatsApp

1296
01:02:52,240 --> 01:03:01,000
and the the 11th circle of hell called Facebook, um, we're gone.

1297
01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:02,640
Like.

1298
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:06,680
Someone sent me an Instagram link and I tried to look at it and I'm like, whoa.

1299
01:03:06,880 --> 01:03:09,680
And it was it was learned it was very this.

1300
01:03:09,880 --> 01:03:12,160
The last Facebook is in captivity.

1301
01:03:12,360 --> 01:03:15,320
The galaxy is at peace, that peace.

1302
01:03:15,520 --> 01:03:18,680
Yes, for five hours on a Monday morning.

1303
01:03:18,880 --> 01:03:22,680
And everybody in the 60 and up demographic

1304
01:03:22,880 --> 01:03:28,160
nowhere to go, couldn't play Farmville or whatever they're doing now.

1305
01:03:28,360 --> 01:03:31,680
Um, anyway, um.

1306
01:03:31,880 --> 01:03:33,400
So.

1307
01:03:34,680 --> 01:03:38,040
Deleting, it was if I think it did affect

1308
01:03:38,240 --> 01:03:42,520
people who were using Oculus, weren't it, didn't it?

1309
01:03:42,720 --> 01:03:46,400
Oh, yes, because your Oculus stuff is tied to Facebook.

1310
01:03:46,600 --> 01:03:47,920
Yeah.

1311
01:03:48,960 --> 01:03:49,680
Yeah.

1312
01:03:49,880 --> 01:03:56,600
And then it was they basically posted that, yeah, some people, quote,

1313
01:03:56,800 --> 01:04:00,040
this is a bullshit post, were having trouble accessing their apps

1314
01:04:00,080 --> 01:04:04,200
and games, but they were working to get it back to normal,

1315
01:04:04,400 --> 01:04:09,720
which unfortunately they did and a huge amount of the VR contingent cried out.

1316
01:04:09,920 --> 01:04:14,000
This is why we didn't want this bullshit in Oculus.

1317
01:04:14,200 --> 01:04:19,200
I like, um, the quote from FIFA Mobile.

1318
01:04:19,400 --> 01:04:23,960
We're aware that a counseling to Facebook may be encountering issues with logging in.

1319
01:04:24,160 --> 01:04:27,600
This is due to an outage at Facebook and we hope they resolve it shortly.

1320
01:04:27,600 --> 01:04:28,800
Thanks for your patience.

1321
01:04:28,800 --> 01:04:32,520
I saw Niantic put a thing out for Pokemon Go, too, because a lot of people

1322
01:04:32,720 --> 01:04:38,240
that with Facebook, this this is why you don't have Facebook log into your shit for you.

1323
01:04:38,440 --> 01:04:39,440
And here's the thing.

1324
01:04:39,640 --> 01:04:45,400
I, of course, saw the oh, so socially aware Twitter contingent

1325
01:04:45,600 --> 01:04:49,640
that was saying we shouldn't be celebrating this because there's people

1326
01:04:49,840 --> 01:04:53,760
in other countries that use WhatsApp for their primary communication.

1327
01:04:53,760 --> 01:04:56,000
And WhatsApp is basically like the phone to them.

1328
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,080
And you all are taking delight in these

1329
01:04:58,080 --> 01:05:01,120
communications being down in these countries where it's needed.

1330
01:05:01,320 --> 01:05:04,360
And I'm thinking, hold up.

1331
01:05:04,560 --> 01:05:09,720
There's a difference between taking delight and being well aware that maybe,

1332
01:05:09,920 --> 01:05:15,040
maybe this should give us all pause to something that a lot of us have been

1333
01:05:15,040 --> 01:05:19,880
saying for some time now, and that is how many fucking cookie jars Facebook has

1334
01:05:20,080 --> 01:05:25,080
their hands in. It is 100 percent OK and no, you will not shut me up to say,

1335
01:05:25,240 --> 01:05:29,000
well, maybe Facebook shouldn't own WhatsApp if it's

1336
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:31,120
that fucking important in all these countries.

1337
01:05:31,320 --> 01:05:34,360
Maybe Facebook and WhatsApp should be separated.

1338
01:05:34,560 --> 01:05:39,120
And that's the conversation you and I both should be having and not you coming

1339
01:05:39,320 --> 01:05:43,200
for me going, but what about the people in the what?

1340
01:05:43,400 --> 01:05:47,040
Stop, stop.

1341
01:05:47,240 --> 01:05:48,880
Like nothing pissed me off more than that.

1342
01:05:48,880 --> 01:05:51,440
I'm sorry, but it's like, who are you trying to impress?

1343
01:05:51,640 --> 01:05:53,160
Who are you trying to impress?

1344
01:05:53,320 --> 01:05:54,880
Do you want to suck Zuckerberg's cock

1345
01:05:54,880 --> 01:05:56,840
while you're at it, because that's basically what you're doing.

1346
01:05:57,040 --> 01:05:58,600
Stop it.

1347
01:06:00,200 --> 01:06:02,320
I have feelings, sorry.

1348
01:06:02,520 --> 01:06:04,360
Tiger Claw on chat says, my parents use

1349
01:06:04,360 --> 01:06:06,840
WhatsApp because we have relatives in Cuba who use it.

1350
01:06:06,960 --> 01:06:10,760
I'm sorry, that line of communication went down for five days or five, five days,

1351
01:06:10,960 --> 01:06:14,400
five hours, and I hope that maybe this gives us all

1352
01:06:14,600 --> 01:06:19,560
question to should these, should Facebook have control over a company like this?

1353
01:06:19,680 --> 01:06:21,720
Or should we be looking at alternatives

1354
01:06:21,920 --> 01:06:27,400
like Signal, like Telegram, like there's a lot of choices out there.

1355
01:06:27,600 --> 01:06:29,720
Pick any of them.

1356
01:06:31,680 --> 01:06:36,480
Sia Tabiri in chat says they broke up AT&T from AT&T Mobile in the 90s.

1357
01:06:36,680 --> 01:06:38,920
Oh, yeah, that came right back.

1358
01:06:39,120 --> 01:06:40,360
They need to do it again.

1359
01:06:40,560 --> 01:06:42,840
Yeah, that's true.

1360
01:06:43,040 --> 01:06:47,520
Anyway, like all of the telecoms, Comcast,

1361
01:06:47,720 --> 01:06:50,640
you know, NBC, you know,

1362
01:06:50,840 --> 01:06:53,760
all of them, just all of them.

1363
01:06:53,960 --> 01:06:55,360
Dark Sakura,

1364
01:06:55,560 --> 01:06:58,760
I know old man was yelling at Cloud for a little bit, but I don't think you disagree

1365
01:06:58,760 --> 01:07:02,040
either. You have some similar feelings, I think, when it comes to the Facebooks.

1366
01:07:02,040 --> 01:07:02,800
Yes.

1367
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:05,280
Yeah, I mean.

1368
01:07:05,480 --> 01:07:08,400
I find the place to be a cesspool

1369
01:07:08,600 --> 01:07:15,440
and not just with how it tracks and steals information,

1370
01:07:15,600 --> 01:07:20,560
but also with, I'm trying to think of how I want to phrase this,

1371
01:07:20,760 --> 01:07:22,760
with a certain culture that's fostered there.

1372
01:07:22,960 --> 01:07:27,400
And I'm not just talking about the right wing red people, you know,

1373
01:07:27,600 --> 01:07:32,320
but I'm also talking about the echo chamber of the

1374
01:07:32,520 --> 01:07:35,200
the left massive echo chamber.

1375
01:07:35,400 --> 01:07:38,760
Sure. And it encourages that sort of circular

1376
01:07:38,960 --> 01:07:42,760
type of discussion with so much confirmation bias.

1377
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:48,360
And because that's what they're promoting, those are the posts that you see first

1378
01:07:48,560 --> 01:07:52,640
or the we want you to get mad about this thing that other people are doing so we

1379
01:07:52,840 --> 01:07:57,560
can make profit off of your anger and there is so much sell me underwear.

1380
01:07:57,760 --> 01:08:00,200
So, you know, that's the thing.

1381
01:08:00,400 --> 01:08:04,760
It was a very stressful place for me and my life has been a lot better without it.

1382
01:08:04,960 --> 01:08:06,680
Loki, if you want it to stop showing you

1383
01:08:06,680 --> 01:08:09,600
underwear ads or whatever, there is a place you can go in and erase

1384
01:08:09,600 --> 01:08:10,960
like everything it's tracking on.

1385
01:08:11,200 --> 01:08:14,800
I know I just use an ad blocker anyway, so whatever.

1386
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:19,040
Well, I'm on my mobile phone, so that's why it's just you can get ad block

1387
01:08:19,240 --> 01:08:22,920
for a mobile phone, I know, but I'm getting a new mobile phone here pretty soon.

1388
01:08:22,920 --> 01:08:24,400
So I haven't really bothered with it.

1389
01:08:24,600 --> 01:08:28,760
Here's the thing, too, with with Facebook and all that stuff is that there's also

1390
01:08:28,960 --> 01:08:32,200
so much international influence going on on there like Facebook.

1391
01:08:32,200 --> 01:08:36,040
You know, I don't want to sound drastic, but I said this in a chat the other day.

1392
01:08:36,040 --> 01:08:37,920
I said there is a world war being fought

1393
01:08:37,960 --> 01:08:41,640
right now and it's being fought on Facebook and the weapon is misinformation.

1394
01:08:41,840 --> 01:08:44,360
And guess what? America is losing.

1395
01:08:44,560 --> 01:08:46,520
It's almost like they had a whistleblower

1396
01:08:46,520 --> 01:08:49,400
come out and say the same exact thing the same day it went down.

1397
01:08:49,600 --> 01:08:53,040
It's so weird and I don't mean to be old boomer yells at cloud,

1398
01:08:53,040 --> 01:08:54,400
which is apparently the theme tonight,

1399
01:08:54,400 --> 01:08:56,600
but I don't care because I do also think that's kind of important.

1400
01:08:56,600 --> 01:08:59,720
And yes, this does have to do with gaming because we have Facebook gaming.

1401
01:08:59,720 --> 01:09:02,120
We have all of this comes into gaming culture and all that stuff.

1402
01:09:02,320 --> 01:09:05,800
And I'm so happy that the government is finally doing something and looking

1403
01:09:05,800 --> 01:09:08,440
into it because, yes, there are a lot of problems with Facebook.

1404
01:09:08,640 --> 01:09:10,520
Let's tie it to something else that was in the news.

1405
01:09:10,520 --> 01:09:12,280
Twitch with this hack and all this stuff

1406
01:09:12,480 --> 01:09:15,120
and the hate raids, something they did recently.

1407
01:09:15,120 --> 01:09:18,760
I even have two factor authentication on my account and I still had to do this.

1408
01:09:18,920 --> 01:09:21,840
I wanted to chat in somebody's channel and it said, hold on,

1409
01:09:21,840 --> 01:09:24,120
we need to text you to verify this account first.

1410
01:09:24,320 --> 01:09:26,680
And OK, so I did that whole thing.

1411
01:09:26,880 --> 01:09:30,640
Why doesn't Facebook do this?

1412
01:09:30,840 --> 01:09:35,120
Make you text, verify your accounts the same way that Twitch does it,

1413
01:09:35,120 --> 01:09:39,680
you have to use an SMS number and you can't use a Google thing.

1414
01:09:39,680 --> 01:09:41,280
You can't use a burner account to do it.

1415
01:09:41,480 --> 01:09:43,920
It has to be a legitimate SMS number.

1416
01:09:43,920 --> 01:09:44,880
Why can't they do that?

1417
01:09:44,880 --> 01:09:46,480
Why can't they take that simple step

1418
01:09:46,680 --> 01:09:50,160
to ensure that the people on there are who they say they are?

1419
01:09:50,160 --> 01:09:52,880
And if somebody doesn't have the phone, well, then you know what?

1420
01:09:53,080 --> 01:09:54,720
They don't they don't have the Facebook

1421
01:09:54,920 --> 01:09:58,120
mobile app anyway, so they're no views to Facebook.

1422
01:09:58,320 --> 01:10:00,880
Facebook could take that precaution tomorrow,

1423
01:10:01,080 --> 01:10:04,040
but they're not going to until it was their bottom line.

1424
01:10:04,040 --> 01:10:05,520
It's just like what they go, you know,

1425
01:10:05,720 --> 01:10:09,960
go what the whistleblower saying is that they could stop hate speech

1426
01:10:10,160 --> 01:10:13,000
or at least could curb some of the misinformation on there.

1427
01:10:13,080 --> 01:10:15,640
But then it would drop engagement, which hurts their bottom line.

1428
01:10:15,840 --> 01:10:20,800
They make decisions that really only benefit their bottom line, which is money.

1429
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:24,920
They don't really care, just like how it's super frustrating that I go on there

1430
01:10:25,120 --> 01:10:28,560
and I can't just view stuff chronologically, please.

1431
01:10:28,760 --> 01:10:31,200
Even like Twitter does the same thing now

1432
01:10:31,200 --> 01:10:33,800
where it's like kind of annoying, they mix stuff up in there.

1433
01:10:33,800 --> 01:10:37,000
But for the most part, at least it's somewhat chronological.

1434
01:10:37,200 --> 01:10:39,760
And you can switch if I could find something.

1435
01:10:39,960 --> 01:10:42,840
You can carry this very easily on Twitter.

1436
01:10:43,040 --> 01:10:45,480
That's why I don't get Twitter as much shit.

1437
01:10:45,680 --> 01:10:50,880
But like, you know, with with Facebook, at least like I do like I do use Facebook

1438
01:10:51,080 --> 01:10:54,280
for some of the groups I'm in for like Minecraft and stuff like that.

1439
01:10:54,480 --> 01:10:57,840
So I'll like browser those, which those are fine.

1440
01:10:58,040 --> 01:10:59,000
But.

1441
01:10:59,200 --> 01:11:03,280
It's just it's I always have to constantly set it to go in chronological order.

1442
01:11:03,280 --> 01:11:05,600
It's like, no, we want you to see it this way.

1443
01:11:05,800 --> 01:11:06,800
And it's irritating.

1444
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:09,320
Like, I just can't like I'll find something.

1445
01:11:09,520 --> 01:11:13,640
I'll jump out of the app for a second to go look something up in like my web

1446
01:11:13,840 --> 01:11:16,320
browser, come back, and then it's already gone.

1447
01:11:16,520 --> 01:11:18,080
Like I can't find it again.

1448
01:11:18,280 --> 01:11:19,920
I have a Facebook, too, and I hate it.

1449
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,440
If I didn't have it, I would miss out on big news.

1450
01:11:22,640 --> 01:11:24,320
I would miss out on people getting married

1451
01:11:24,320 --> 01:11:26,760
and having babies because that's just the way it is now.

1452
01:11:26,960 --> 01:11:29,960
And it sucks. Rob, what

1453
01:11:30,120 --> 01:11:34,640
if my friends care enough about me to involve me in that part of their life,

1454
01:11:34,840 --> 01:11:38,720
they'll fucking tell me sometimes the news may not be good.

1455
01:11:38,840 --> 01:11:40,520
And I'm just going to have to leave it at that.

1456
01:11:40,720 --> 01:11:44,000
And that was I have other friends that have been telling me about it.

1457
01:11:44,200 --> 01:11:50,840
But I I'm really to the point where if somebody doesn't tell me.

1458
01:11:51,040 --> 01:11:53,920
If somebody doesn't think enough to bring

1459
01:11:53,920 --> 01:11:57,280
it to my attention, to think this is something I'm interested in,

1460
01:11:57,440 --> 01:12:01,920
like I found out about Barbara through Tiara,

1461
01:12:02,120 --> 01:12:03,640
but.

1462
01:12:03,840 --> 01:12:09,360
I am still not going to give Facebook my attention.

1463
01:12:09,560 --> 01:12:12,080
I'm not going to give it my cookies.

1464
01:12:12,280 --> 01:12:17,160
I posted once in the last, what, three months

1465
01:12:17,360 --> 01:12:20,840
for that damn marathon I'm doing tomorrow and that's it.

1466
01:12:21,040 --> 01:12:22,520
I do not care.

1467
01:12:22,720 --> 01:12:27,040
And if people do not care enough about me to tell me.

1468
01:12:27,520 --> 01:12:29,960
About what's going on with them.

1469
01:12:30,160 --> 01:12:32,800
Then that's on them, that's not on me.

1470
01:12:35,200 --> 01:12:37,800
Everything I don't care about how easy it is either.

1471
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:40,000
This is addressing what Rama said.

1472
01:12:40,200 --> 01:12:42,360
I don't care about it being fucking easy.

1473
01:12:42,560 --> 01:12:47,320
If someone cares enough to involve me in their life,

1474
01:12:47,520 --> 01:12:51,640
they are going to fucking tell me there was a world without Facebook.

1475
01:12:51,840 --> 01:12:54,680
That we're we're old enough to have experienced, yes.

1476
01:12:54,920 --> 01:12:57,680
And then the other thing I want to say with Twitter, everything I was screaming

1477
01:12:57,680 --> 01:13:00,240
about with Facebook and the phone number verification.

1478
01:13:00,240 --> 01:13:02,200
I honestly want Twitter to do it, too.

1479
01:13:02,400 --> 01:13:03,840
I want any social media site to do it.

1480
01:13:03,840 --> 01:13:04,680
I think it's a good idea.

1481
01:13:04,680 --> 01:13:07,040
There should always be some sort of two factor authentication.

1482
01:13:07,240 --> 01:13:08,120
There should be that.

1483
01:13:08,320 --> 01:13:11,960
And just verifying that the number is in the US full stop because

1484
01:13:12,160 --> 01:13:16,280
Twitter has a huge foreign manipulation bot program problem.

1485
01:13:16,480 --> 01:13:21,520
Huge. It's very easy to filter it out because you don't have my.

1486
01:13:22,520 --> 01:13:27,880
You don't have my stupid cousins buying into that bullshit on on Twitter

1487
01:13:28,080 --> 01:13:31,520
that you do on Facebook, but it's definitely there and there are people

1488
01:13:31,720 --> 01:13:33,240
falling for it.

1489
01:13:34,080 --> 01:13:35,280
Anyway,

1490
01:13:35,480 --> 01:13:40,200
now that we're done yelling at clouds, let's move on to our next story.

1491
01:13:40,400 --> 01:13:43,280
One last thing, one less teeny thing.

1492
01:13:43,480 --> 01:13:45,120
Yes, Star Stalker, of course.

1493
01:13:45,320 --> 01:13:48,040
People have forgotten how to talk to each other.

1494
01:13:48,760 --> 01:13:51,440
That's it. People have forgotten how to talk to each other.

1495
01:13:51,640 --> 01:13:55,240
People will sit there and go, why is the world so polarized?

1496
01:13:55,440 --> 01:13:57,600
When did the US become so polarized?

1497
01:13:57,800 --> 01:13:59,240
It's Facebook.

1498
01:13:59,440 --> 01:14:01,640
I just the two there's the two world answer.

1499
01:14:01,840 --> 01:14:04,280
There's the two word answer to all of the problems.

1500
01:14:04,480 --> 01:14:06,080
It's Facebook.

1501
01:14:06,600 --> 01:14:07,400
That's it.

1502
01:14:07,600 --> 01:14:11,520
Any problem that this country is having with polarization, it's Facebook.

1503
01:14:11,720 --> 01:14:17,200
Any problem with the vaccine and the elections and it's Facebook.

1504
01:14:17,400 --> 01:14:18,760
Yep.

1505
01:14:19,760 --> 01:14:22,360
The reason why that Emmy killed me in

1506
01:14:22,360 --> 01:14:25,000
Metroid Dread when I wasn't expecting it, somehow it was Facebook.

1507
01:14:25,200 --> 01:14:26,880
I know it. Moving on.

1508
01:14:27,080 --> 01:14:31,720
I think it was different when we had things like MySpace and LiveJournal

1509
01:14:31,920 --> 01:14:35,960
because MySpace was really just like sort of like a short little, you know.

1510
01:14:36,160 --> 01:14:37,800
It was easy.

1511
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:40,080
It was more Twittery, if that makes sense.

1512
01:14:40,280 --> 01:14:47,000
And LiveJournal for us was basically a public diary.

1513
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:51,720
But, yeah, looking at some comments in chat here,

1514
01:14:51,920 --> 01:14:55,760
I am trying to move on past this topic, but I know you're fine.

1515
01:14:55,960 --> 01:14:58,200
Sacred Jade said conversation is a lost art.

1516
01:14:58,400 --> 01:15:00,960
I thought this was because a lot of people agree with this.

1517
01:15:00,960 --> 01:15:04,960
Fifth Dream says I never wanted to talk to people in the first place

1518
01:15:05,160 --> 01:15:10,800
and kind of goes on and talks about some other problems that existed before Facebook.

1519
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:12,800
Sure, those problems all existed,

1520
01:15:12,800 --> 01:15:15,600
but Facebook amplified it and Facebook

1521
01:15:15,800 --> 01:15:19,200
allowed additional noise to make that conversation even worse.

1522
01:15:19,400 --> 01:15:21,960
But it's like human microphone, right?

1523
01:15:22,160 --> 01:15:23,040
Yeah. Yeah.

1524
01:15:23,240 --> 01:15:25,320
All right. In an echo chamber.

1525
01:15:25,520 --> 01:15:26,760
In everyone's bathroom.

1526
01:15:26,960 --> 01:15:28,200
OK, moving on.

1527
01:15:28,400 --> 01:15:30,040
Next story, Loki.

1528
01:15:30,240 --> 01:15:33,120
So speaking of stuff from the past,

1529
01:15:33,320 --> 01:15:35,480
we finally are catching up from the past

1530
01:15:35,680 --> 01:15:39,520
with Epic Games Store as they're adding achievements.

1531
01:15:39,680 --> 01:15:42,840
Oh, my God, it's about damn time.

1532
01:15:43,040 --> 01:15:45,600
They're like only several years behind everybody.

1533
01:15:45,800 --> 01:15:48,640
Not behind as Nintendo, but, you know, I digress.

1534
01:15:48,840 --> 01:15:51,120
So they're going to be adding a new achievement system.

1535
01:15:51,320 --> 01:15:56,200
It kind of is like a combination of the achievement points that you get on the

1536
01:15:56,400 --> 01:16:02,960
Xbox side of things and the like different trophies that you would get on the PlayStation side.

1537
01:16:03,160 --> 01:16:07,520
So they're going to basically have each game is going to have a thousand XP.

1538
01:16:07,720 --> 01:16:12,240
And with that, they're going to be different achievements that are ranked.

1539
01:16:12,440 --> 01:16:15,360
You have bronze, which is five to forty five points,

1540
01:16:15,560 --> 01:16:21,560
fifty to ninety five for silver, 100 to 200 for gold and 250 for platinum.

1541
01:16:21,760 --> 01:16:26,280
And it's like, how can we steal from PlayStation and Microsoft system and kind

1542
01:16:26,480 --> 01:16:30,920
of combine it into that hybrid Voltron of achievement systems?

1543
01:16:31,120 --> 01:16:36,600
Yeah, so it's going to be very similar to what we see on other platforms, basically.

1544
01:16:36,800 --> 01:16:38,360
So it's about time.

1545
01:16:38,560 --> 01:16:42,960
It also kind of actually makes sense because a lot of those games on the Epic

1546
01:16:43,160 --> 01:16:46,960
Store and any PC game really also exist on consoles.

1547
01:16:47,160 --> 01:16:49,160
And so a lot of developers don't want

1548
01:16:49,360 --> 01:16:52,640
to have to make separate trophy slash achievement systems for that.

1549
01:16:52,840 --> 01:16:56,720
It's very nice when it just kind of all lines up, you know.

1550
01:16:56,920 --> 01:16:58,840
And maybe what's a bronze trophy here is

1551
01:16:59,040 --> 01:17:03,440
20 points here is both on the Epic Store, I guess, or whatever the case is.

1552
01:17:03,640 --> 01:17:04,800
So.

1553
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:06,560
There's that.

1554
01:17:07,480 --> 01:17:10,280
Do they need achievements?

1555
01:17:10,480 --> 01:17:14,240
Like a lot of people are saying it's three years too late or whatever,

1556
01:17:14,440 --> 01:17:16,960
Nintendo's gotten away with not doing achievements for a long time.

1557
01:17:17,160 --> 01:17:20,200
I think we'd all like them to have it, but.

1558
01:17:20,400 --> 01:17:22,600
Yeah, it's I think that they do.

1559
01:17:22,600 --> 01:17:24,440
I mean, it would be nice to have that just

1560
01:17:24,640 --> 01:17:27,600
to have be more robust and more feature complete.

1561
01:17:27,800 --> 01:17:29,600
I mean, they're still.

1562
01:17:29,800 --> 01:17:32,800
Stopping carts and other things that they really need on the storefront.

1563
01:17:32,800 --> 01:17:37,280
I mean, honestly, like we really shouldn't have early access shopping places.

1564
01:17:37,480 --> 01:17:41,400
It should just be complete already, but.

1565
01:17:41,600 --> 01:17:43,840
It's Epic Game Store, so whatever.

1566
01:17:44,040 --> 01:17:48,200
At least I get free PC building simulator this week.

1567
01:17:48,400 --> 01:17:49,640
Oh, yeah, I picked that up, too.

1568
01:17:49,640 --> 01:17:51,120
Bobby Black Wolf pointed that out to me.

1569
01:17:51,120 --> 01:17:53,960
I was like, you should get this. I'm like, OK, because I'm all about right now.

1570
01:17:54,160 --> 01:17:55,720
Yeah, I do want to play that.

1571
01:17:55,920 --> 01:17:58,040
All right. But yeah, that's it.

1572
01:17:58,240 --> 01:17:59,120
All right.

1573
01:17:59,320 --> 01:18:01,680
Moving on to our next story.

1574
01:18:01,840 --> 01:18:05,400
We had a famous video game composer who passed away this week,

1575
01:18:05,600 --> 01:18:10,200
the composer of Dragon Quest, Kochi Sugiyama, passed away at the age of 90.

1576
01:18:10,400 --> 01:18:14,080
You may know him from the iconic theme to Dragon Quest.

1577
01:18:14,280 --> 01:18:17,280
He passed away at the age of 90.

1578
01:18:17,480 --> 01:18:20,880
Let's go on to our next story, Dark Sakura.

1579
01:18:21,080 --> 01:18:23,440
May his memory be a blessing.

1580
01:18:23,640 --> 01:18:25,200
So

1581
01:18:25,600 --> 01:18:31,360
well, more in the Activision Blizzard bullshit drama.

1582
01:18:31,560 --> 01:18:34,000
And I mean, the bullshit is that they're full of bullshit,

1583
01:18:34,200 --> 01:18:40,360
but now the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing,

1584
01:18:40,560 --> 01:18:47,600
DFEH, has filed a motion to intervene in the settlement between the U.S.

1585
01:18:47,800 --> 01:18:51,040
Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and Activision Blizzard,

1586
01:18:51,200 --> 01:18:55,840
arguing that their own trial against

1587
01:18:56,040 --> 01:19:02,040
against the company will be irreparably damaged by the conditions of the settlement.

1588
01:19:02,240 --> 01:19:06,400
The settlement also includes a clause that will

1589
01:19:06,600 --> 01:19:10,600
request that will allow Activision Blizzard to remove

1590
01:19:10,800 --> 01:19:16,000
any allegations of sexual harassment from personnel files in the settlement.

1591
01:19:16,200 --> 01:19:22,640
So basically, it's destroying evidence that's going to go for DFEH's trial.

1592
01:19:23,840 --> 01:19:27,080
They actually met with both

1593
01:19:27,280 --> 01:19:34,040
Activision Blizzard and EEOC on October 5th to let them know of its plan to intervene.

1594
01:19:34,240 --> 01:19:37,640
Normally, they'd have to wait seven days before filing for the intervention.

1595
01:19:37,840 --> 01:19:42,880
But because of the grave harm, they filed the motion ex parte,

1596
01:19:42,920 --> 01:19:44,520
which basically allows it to be filed

1597
01:19:44,720 --> 01:19:48,400
instantly if the court finds it to be a reasonable request.

1598
01:19:48,600 --> 01:19:49,960
So

1599
01:19:50,160 --> 01:19:52,160
and of course,

1600
01:19:52,360 --> 01:19:55,800
you can see why something like that would be absolutely important,

1601
01:19:56,000 --> 01:20:01,120
because if they have the permission to destroy this evidence,

1602
01:20:01,320 --> 01:20:04,480
then they're just going to keep doing it.

1603
01:20:04,680 --> 01:20:08,680
That's the whole fucking terrible thing about settling like that.

1604
01:20:08,760 --> 01:20:12,080
And they have a history of

1605
01:20:12,280 --> 01:20:14,520
of destroying evidence.

1606
01:20:14,720 --> 01:20:18,640
Two months ago, DFEH accused the company

1607
01:20:18,840 --> 01:20:22,360
of shredding evidence that would reflect on

1608
01:20:22,560 --> 01:20:29,080
the company poorly in in the same case with their also

1609
01:20:29,280 --> 01:20:32,640
you know, the fact that they've hired a union busting firm and they're trying to

1610
01:20:32,840 --> 01:20:35,760
do a lot of sweeping under the table.

1611
01:20:36,760 --> 01:20:38,760
They're

1612
01:20:39,760 --> 01:20:42,160
they're not it's not a pretty look for them.

1613
01:20:42,160 --> 01:20:43,720
We know they've tried to do it before.

1614
01:20:43,920 --> 01:20:44,880
We know what they're doing.

1615
01:20:45,080 --> 01:20:47,200
It's obvious what they're doing.

1616
01:20:47,400 --> 01:20:52,320
And I'm really glad the DFEH is saying, hey, we're not having this shit.

1617
01:20:52,520 --> 01:20:54,400
No bad company.

1618
01:20:54,600 --> 01:20:56,160
No cookie.

1619
01:20:56,680 --> 01:20:58,680
I don't have anything else to add.

1620
01:20:58,680 --> 01:21:01,600
I'm looking forward to the deposition of Bobby Kotek.

1621
01:21:01,800 --> 01:21:03,480
Yeah.

1622
01:21:04,360 --> 01:21:10,120
Kotaku, by the way, it's where I don't like to say certain things by name,

1623
01:21:10,320 --> 01:21:15,000
but they actually did get a statement from Activision Blizzard.

1624
01:21:15,200 --> 01:21:18,000
Sure, I'll read it verbatim.

1625
01:21:18,200 --> 01:21:20,920
We are committed to making Activision Blizzard the most welcoming,

1626
01:21:20,920 --> 01:21:22,720
inclusive and safe workplace possible.

1627
01:21:22,920 --> 01:21:25,160
Our agreement with the EEOC reflects our

1628
01:21:25,360 --> 01:21:29,400
commitment to significant improvements and transparency, as well as making

1629
01:21:29,440 --> 01:21:33,640
immediate compensation available to eligible employees who choose to participate.

1630
01:21:33,840 --> 01:21:36,960
Activision Blizzard is ensuring a workplace free from

1631
01:21:36,960 --> 01:21:39,560
discrimination, harassment and unequal treatment of any time.

1632
01:21:39,560 --> 01:21:41,040
Bullshit.

1633
01:21:41,240 --> 01:21:42,960
Bullshit.

1634
01:21:43,160 --> 01:21:47,040
I mean, like in the settlement, it states

1635
01:21:47,240 --> 01:21:49,840
and I'll go ahead and just also verbatim this,

1636
01:21:49,840 --> 01:21:53,120
because I think it's important to listen to the language of it.

1637
01:21:53,320 --> 01:21:54,880
Within 30 days from the date,

1638
01:21:54,880 --> 01:22:00,280
the EEOC notifies Activision Blizzard the names on the distribution lists.

1639
01:22:00,480 --> 01:22:05,400
They agreed to A, remove the personnel files of each eligible claimant,

1640
01:22:05,600 --> 01:22:09,040
any references to the allegations related to sexual harassment,

1641
01:22:09,240 --> 01:22:14,480
pregnancy discrimination and or related retaliation, except to the extent

1642
01:22:14,680 --> 01:22:18,800
that defendants must keep records of the allegations for any eligible claimants

1643
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:23,880
involvement in this charge in order to effect this, effectuate this decree,

1644
01:22:24,080 --> 01:22:26,640
which in case such records must be maintained

1645
01:22:26,840 --> 01:22:31,720
separately from the eligible claimants personnel files.

1646
01:22:32,560 --> 01:22:34,400
Does that make sense to people?

1647
01:22:34,600 --> 01:22:36,480
Because it says.

1648
01:22:36,680 --> 01:22:42,720
They can delete it and the other stuff has to be kept separate from the personnel file.

1649
01:22:42,920 --> 01:22:44,400
And

1650
01:22:44,600 --> 01:22:48,200
I'll just say, I think Tigerclaw puts it very succinctly in our chat over

1651
01:22:48,200 --> 01:22:51,440
at twitch.tv slash VOG Network saying destroying the evidence just makes it

1652
01:22:51,480 --> 01:22:53,600
sound like they're guilty of something.

1653
01:22:53,800 --> 01:22:55,320
Well, there's even more to this.

1654
01:22:55,520 --> 01:22:58,880
This has to do with evidence of us not doing this thing.

1655
01:22:58,880 --> 01:23:02,720
We just can get rid of some of it and we'll still find, as I was saying,

1656
01:23:02,920 --> 01:23:06,880
there's even more that's really nefarious about this settlement as well.

1657
01:23:06,880 --> 01:23:10,520
And that has to do with the distribution of the settlement funds.

1658
01:23:10,720 --> 01:23:13,120
So, again, I'll read this verbatim.

1659
01:23:13,320 --> 01:23:15,080
If any of the settlement fund remains

1660
01:23:15,280 --> 01:23:19,040
undistributed after exhausting the efforts to locate the eligible claimants

1661
01:23:19,080 --> 01:23:25,400
set forth, the excess funds will be distributed between Cyprus Fund for

1662
01:23:25,400 --> 01:23:29,440
distribution to charitable organizations whose missions involved advancing women

1663
01:23:29,640 --> 01:23:33,640
in the video game and technology industries or promoting awareness around

1664
01:23:33,840 --> 01:23:38,480
sexual harassment, gender equality issues, and the diversity and inclusion fund to

1665
01:23:38,680 --> 01:23:42,760
be used by the defendants exclusively for diversity, inclusion and

1666
01:23:42,960 --> 01:23:47,120
equity efforts beyond the scope in terms of this the decree.

1667
01:23:47,320 --> 01:23:51,560
The allocation between Cyprus Fund and diversity and inclusion fund will be

1668
01:23:51,760 --> 01:23:56,160
decided by the defendants, but subject to approval by EEOC.

1669
01:23:56,360 --> 01:23:58,320
So basically,

1670
01:23:58,520 --> 01:24:05,080
Activision Blizzard could use this money for other things that they would, quote,

1671
01:24:05,280 --> 01:24:07,600
say it goes into.

1672
01:24:07,800 --> 01:24:12,920
Improving diversity, but might not necessarily do it.

1673
01:24:13,920 --> 01:24:15,320
And they're willing.

1674
01:24:15,520 --> 01:24:17,960
There's a lot of failure into that.

1675
01:24:18,160 --> 01:24:20,840
Yeah, exactly.

1676
01:24:21,040 --> 01:24:23,000
And they are, again,

1677
01:24:23,200 --> 01:24:28,880
limiting any sort of information to be disclosed about their liability in any of

1678
01:24:29,080 --> 01:24:34,320
this and it seems innocent to me.

1679
01:24:34,520 --> 01:24:38,200
It's absolutely nefarious.

1680
01:24:38,400 --> 01:24:41,480
And this intervention, I mean, they've done this before.

1681
01:24:41,520 --> 01:24:43,720
They did it with Riot Games.

1682
01:24:45,560 --> 01:24:48,040
And this probably happened last time.

1683
01:24:49,240 --> 01:24:51,680
Yeah, this is.

1684
01:24:51,880 --> 01:24:53,400
We need to keep our eyes on this.

1685
01:24:53,400 --> 01:24:56,560
We need to pay attention to the precedent, something like this sets.

1686
01:24:56,760 --> 01:25:02,080
And honestly enough, it's why the whole settlement business.

1687
01:25:02,280 --> 01:25:04,640
Is disgusting.

1688
01:25:04,840 --> 01:25:07,160
It absolutely is disgusting.

1689
01:25:07,360 --> 01:25:10,040
All right, I got nothing to add, except this

1690
01:25:10,080 --> 01:25:13,640
news story is just going to continue to be in the news every week.

1691
01:25:13,840 --> 01:25:18,280
So settlements mean people with money can walk away.

1692
01:25:18,480 --> 01:25:21,640
With no damage, pretty much.

1693
01:25:21,840 --> 01:25:24,960
All right, let's move on, Loki.

1694
01:25:25,160 --> 01:25:29,680
Yeah, so we're talking about how Sony is

1695
01:25:29,880 --> 01:25:34,680
planning on discontinuing these stores for the Vita and PlayStation three.

1696
01:25:34,880 --> 01:25:38,840
Well, right now they're planning on removing credit card and PayPal support

1697
01:25:38,840 --> 01:25:43,800
from both stores in late October, so essentially kneecapping them.

1698
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:48,160
I guess you can still have those stores open to redownload software that you've

1699
01:25:48,360 --> 01:25:52,400
already purchased, but you're going to be unable to make any more purchases

1700
01:25:52,600 --> 01:25:55,640
starting October twenty seven.

1701
01:25:55,840 --> 01:25:57,240
So.

1702
01:25:58,360 --> 01:26:02,720
This is this is them trying to phase those things out again, but now they're just

1703
01:26:02,920 --> 01:26:07,360
no, I saw the purchase thing, but I saw a legit thing about like how

1704
01:26:07,400 --> 01:26:10,240
the credit card fees and stuff, they probably just don't want to be paying for

1705
01:26:10,240 --> 01:26:14,440
those anymore, there's probably there as much as the Internet was pissed off when

1706
01:26:14,440 --> 01:26:18,320
Sony threatened to pull these things the first time, I'm pretty sure the reality is

1707
01:26:18,520 --> 01:26:23,080
these stores are not being used very much by the credit card fees.

1708
01:26:23,080 --> 01:26:24,880
You'd only get paid by transaction.

1709
01:26:24,880 --> 01:26:26,320
I can't imagine that it would be more

1710
01:26:26,520 --> 01:26:30,000
expensive on this storefront versus like their current storefront.

1711
01:26:30,200 --> 01:26:32,800
I think it's more of just like.

1712
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:34,760
They want to drive people towards newer

1713
01:26:34,800 --> 01:26:39,520
software, and so they're probably just going to shut this down so people spend

1714
01:26:39,720 --> 01:26:44,440
their hard earned money on those seventy dollar Sony games instead of, you know.

1715
01:26:44,640 --> 01:26:47,600
The original, especially when we were talking about like remasters and remakes,

1716
01:26:47,800 --> 01:26:52,280
you know, hey, buy the original for 20 bucks instead of 70 or something like that.

1717
01:26:52,480 --> 01:26:56,280
And several folks in chat are saying you can still add money.

1718
01:26:56,280 --> 01:26:57,680
You just can't do it directly.

1719
01:26:57,880 --> 01:27:04,440
Yes, yes. But do I sort of also can tell this is the first step in where

1720
01:27:04,480 --> 01:27:07,960
Sony has already shown they would like to be.

1721
01:27:08,160 --> 01:27:09,880
But on one hand, I do get it.

1722
01:27:09,880 --> 01:27:13,360
You know, I think for the direct, you know, whatever they built into the system

1723
01:27:13,360 --> 01:27:15,960
and so forth, they probably just don't want to be paying for it anymore.

1724
01:27:16,160 --> 01:27:18,040
But it isn't worth it to them.

1725
01:27:18,240 --> 01:27:21,160
And there's a part of me that does get that.

1726
01:27:21,360 --> 01:27:25,120
And like you guys are saying, you can still get money on there.

1727
01:27:25,320 --> 01:27:29,840
It's not going to be as easy, but you can do it.

1728
01:27:30,040 --> 01:27:32,520
So it's not like they're gone.

1729
01:27:32,680 --> 01:27:36,080
So, yeah, yeah. All right.

1730
01:27:36,280 --> 01:27:38,280
Moving on to our next story.

1731
01:27:38,480 --> 01:27:40,560
Kotaku ran a report this week talking

1732
01:27:40,760 --> 01:27:44,480
about how Metroid Dread is already running on switch emulators.

1733
01:27:44,680 --> 01:27:47,960
And in the report, Kotaku has talked about how the game is

1734
01:27:48,160 --> 01:27:52,600
fully playable in various 4K Nintendo switch emulators.

1735
01:27:52,800 --> 01:27:55,680
They reference a couple of emulators in the story.

1736
01:27:55,680 --> 01:27:58,400
They talk about Yuzu, which is an open source emulator.

1737
01:27:58,600 --> 01:28:00,640
They talk about Ryujinx, which is another

1738
01:28:00,640 --> 01:28:02,920
one that both of these can play the game.

1739
01:28:03,120 --> 01:28:08,840
You can see some YouTubes of this in action because it plays the game at 4K.

1740
01:28:09,040 --> 01:28:10,720
Kotaku is getting a lot of shit for running

1741
01:28:10,920 --> 01:28:14,440
this article from folks on the Twitters and on social media.

1742
01:28:14,640 --> 01:28:17,600
And I think a lot of people are very upset because

1743
01:28:17,800 --> 01:28:21,040
Kotaku is talking about piracy

1744
01:28:21,240 --> 01:28:25,080
only a couple of days after the game came out, I guess.

1745
01:28:25,280 --> 01:28:26,520
Here's the thing, though, I don't get it.

1746
01:28:26,720 --> 01:28:29,840
I think that outrage is kind of misplaced.

1747
01:28:30,040 --> 01:28:33,080
Like, I can I'll meet you halfway.

1748
01:28:33,280 --> 01:28:35,840
I'll meet you to the point part way, maybe not even halfway.

1749
01:28:35,840 --> 01:28:36,720
I'll meet you part way.

1750
01:28:36,920 --> 01:28:39,760
I understand maybe Kotaku didn't firmly

1751
01:28:39,960 --> 01:28:45,880
enough say, hey, downloading software illegally is wrong.

1752
01:28:46,080 --> 01:28:49,760
But they also didn't link to the ROMs, they linked to the emulators.

1753
01:28:49,960 --> 01:28:53,840
And now all of you that are mad about it and posting about it.

1754
01:28:54,040 --> 01:28:55,760
It's just the Streisand effect.

1755
01:28:55,960 --> 01:28:58,120
Now you're spreading this more openly

1756
01:28:58,120 --> 01:29:01,280
that the game is emulatable in these emulators.

1757
01:29:01,480 --> 01:29:02,320
Here's the thing.

1758
01:29:02,520 --> 01:29:05,960
Here's why I think Kotaku as a gaming,

1759
01:29:06,160 --> 01:29:09,120
I cannot believe how fucking full circle we've come.

1760
01:29:09,320 --> 01:29:11,600
Here I am about to defend this website.

1761
01:29:11,800 --> 01:29:13,640
Look, y'all note the date and time.

1762
01:29:13,840 --> 01:29:16,640
Here I am about to defend this website.

1763
01:29:16,840 --> 01:29:18,320
My how far we've come.

1764
01:29:18,520 --> 01:29:21,360
However, be that as it may.

1765
01:29:21,560 --> 01:29:25,120
They're making a point is that right now,

1766
01:29:25,160 --> 01:29:27,560
only like two, three days after release,

1767
01:29:27,760 --> 01:29:34,720
this game is running better on these emulators than it does on the hardware.

1768
01:29:34,920 --> 01:29:36,440
So there's point number one.

1769
01:29:36,640 --> 01:29:40,720
And I think that is a newsworthy point, whether you like it or not.

1770
01:29:40,920 --> 01:29:45,400
Because technically, you're not supposed to use these emulators if you don't have

1771
01:29:45,400 --> 01:29:48,760
the software and the way to get the card to read on your computer and all this stuff.

1772
01:29:48,960 --> 01:29:51,200
Yes, I know who really does that.

1773
01:29:51,400 --> 01:29:54,880
I know, but that's the way these emulators are supposed to run that,

1774
01:29:54,880 --> 01:29:59,840
because I have the game, so it would be fun, though, to check it out on like a 4K

1775
01:30:00,040 --> 01:30:04,520
console or like on a PC and the one I saw them rain in 4K.

1776
01:30:04,720 --> 01:30:09,080
It's just right now, GTX 1060, like my son's laptop is less

1777
01:30:09,280 --> 01:30:12,600
respect than mine can run it like 60 FPS.

1778
01:30:12,800 --> 01:30:17,960
So my like, dang, I can run that at, you know, 4K or something like that.

1779
01:30:18,160 --> 01:30:19,640
That'd be awesome.

1780
01:30:19,840 --> 01:30:23,800
And I should be able to do that because I own the software.

1781
01:30:24,280 --> 01:30:26,600
Here's the other

1782
01:30:26,800 --> 01:30:29,360
interesting thing about the article.

1783
01:30:29,560 --> 01:30:33,280
I want to read this part verbatim because I thought this is where they really made

1784
01:30:33,480 --> 01:30:37,200
this is where they made their point, in my opinion.

1785
01:30:37,400 --> 01:30:39,720
Thanks to Nintendo's rather poor approach

1786
01:30:39,920 --> 01:30:43,960
to supporting older games, especially those on the Game Boy Advance and DS,

1787
01:30:44,160 --> 01:30:48,240
emulation is often the only viable means to play through their collection.

1788
01:30:48,440 --> 01:30:51,600
And this is the case for much of the Metroid franchise.

1789
01:30:51,800 --> 01:30:53,440
There are so many good reasons to be

1790
01:30:53,640 --> 01:30:56,240
grateful for pirates, emulators, modders and hackers.

1791
01:30:56,440 --> 01:30:59,080
They they may have overeaten at the buffet

1792
01:30:59,080 --> 01:31:00,720
with that the way that sentence is structured.

1793
01:31:00,920 --> 01:31:03,000
But let's let's focus on the point

1794
01:31:03,200 --> 01:31:07,920
for doing what so many big publishers won't keeping old games alive.

1795
01:31:08,120 --> 01:31:11,240
Clearly, that's not the case for Metroid Dread, a brand new game.

1796
01:31:11,440 --> 01:31:13,600
But this is an enormous issue Nintendo has

1797
01:31:13,800 --> 01:31:18,880
to face given the relative technical inferiority of its current console.

1798
01:31:19,080 --> 01:31:22,520
Now, although I think they overate on the sentence where they said,

1799
01:31:22,520 --> 01:31:26,360
be grateful for pirates, I think that might have been a little bit oof.

1800
01:31:26,560 --> 01:31:28,200
Everything else they said in those two

1801
01:31:28,400 --> 01:31:32,400
paragraphs kind of does a very appropriate dragging of Nintendo.

1802
01:31:32,600 --> 01:31:35,680
And the fact that, yeah, you you know,

1803
01:31:35,880 --> 01:31:40,880
everybody's bellyaching for Super Mario RPG to hit the Switch console.

1804
01:31:41,080 --> 01:31:43,320
So how are you all playing that game right now?

1805
01:31:43,400 --> 01:31:45,280
How do you know this game is so great?

1806
01:31:45,480 --> 01:31:47,800
Do you still have a dusty Super Nintendo?

1807
01:31:48,360 --> 01:31:49,480
SNES classic.

1808
01:31:49,680 --> 01:31:54,560
No, but so I would say, though, they should be thanking the emulator

1809
01:31:54,760 --> 01:31:57,920
developers, because that's, I think, a lot of work that

1810
01:31:58,120 --> 01:32:00,280
those people should be thankful for them.

1811
01:32:00,480 --> 01:32:06,320
The piracy, not so much, but, you know, means to an end, I guess so.

1812
01:32:06,520 --> 01:32:07,720
I think it's interesting.

1813
01:32:07,720 --> 01:32:09,800
I think it raises an interesting discussion.

1814
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:13,720
Nintendo, a company that is very sluggish in

1815
01:32:13,840 --> 01:32:18,240
letting you access its back catalog, now has one of its current catalog games

1816
01:32:18,440 --> 01:32:22,000
running at a pretty at a technical specification that's

1817
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:25,880
better than what the console provides, you know, like be funny in it.

1818
01:32:25,880 --> 01:32:27,880
And I'm going to tell you, I'm calling it right now.

1819
01:32:28,080 --> 01:32:29,680
I'm calling it. You're going to see these articles.

1820
01:32:29,880 --> 01:32:31,040
Get ready.

1821
01:32:31,240 --> 01:32:35,120
You're going to see the handheld steam system

1822
01:32:35,320 --> 01:32:39,760
running these games and for, you know, and in a higher resolution or at least

1823
01:32:39,760 --> 01:32:42,400
better quality than actually, you know, it's the 720p screen.

1824
01:32:42,560 --> 01:32:45,760
OK, not higher resolution quality, but at least you're going to have

1825
01:32:45,960 --> 01:32:50,400
better graphic fidelity than, say, a Nintendo Switch.

1826
01:32:50,600 --> 01:32:53,160
Or at least you'll be able to plug it into something or something like that.

1827
01:32:53,360 --> 01:32:58,480
But they'll do the comparison between the Steam handheld console and

1828
01:32:58,680 --> 01:33:01,720
the Nintendo Switch once it comes out.

1829
01:33:01,920 --> 01:33:05,640
All this being said, I want to stress, unlike the Kotaku article,

1830
01:33:05,840 --> 01:33:09,120
I do want to stress, buy Metroid Dread if you have an interest in it.

1831
01:33:09,120 --> 01:33:10,080
It's a good game.

1832
01:33:10,120 --> 01:33:11,560
And Nintendo and the team that made

1833
01:33:11,760 --> 01:33:14,640
that game did earn your money for that purchase.

1834
01:33:14,640 --> 01:33:16,040
So you should go buy this game.

1835
01:33:16,240 --> 01:33:19,760
If you are using these emulators just to pirate things and play things for free.

1836
01:33:19,960 --> 01:33:22,240
Well, then.

1837
01:33:22,440 --> 01:33:26,120
You are the bad people that Twitter is trying to drag right now.

1838
01:33:26,320 --> 01:33:30,600
OK, so but yeah, so so buy the game.

1839
01:33:30,800 --> 01:33:34,880
But I think this side of things where, you know, what's interesting,

1840
01:33:34,880 --> 01:33:39,000
not just Kotaku ran this article, but PC Gamer ran a very similar thing.

1841
01:33:39,120 --> 01:33:43,680
Why would PC Gamer run an article about the Nintendo Switch?

1842
01:33:43,880 --> 01:33:47,240
Because it's just very non PC, that's right, this is all running on a PC,

1843
01:33:47,440 --> 01:33:50,640
so it's just very interesting how that all is coming together.

1844
01:33:50,840 --> 01:33:52,080
All right. Anyway,

1845
01:33:52,280 --> 01:33:55,600
let the other thing, the two I see that's more exciting and it's not necessarily

1846
01:33:55,800 --> 01:33:59,400
talked about yet is all of the modifications that can be

1847
01:33:59,600 --> 01:34:02,360
done to some of these games in an emulator environment.

1848
01:34:02,360 --> 01:34:04,640
So like, you know, all the crazy stuff you see with,

1849
01:34:04,840 --> 01:34:07,080
you know, Breath of the Wild and stuff like that.

1850
01:34:07,280 --> 01:34:09,400
That's, I think, more exciting.

1851
01:34:09,600 --> 01:34:15,080
Hell, if people are very dedicated enough, we could put Waluigi in Smash.

1852
01:34:15,280 --> 01:34:19,120
It could be a reality because they've done similar things to Melee.

1853
01:34:19,320 --> 01:34:21,680
I'm thinking more along the lines of that

1854
01:34:21,880 --> 01:34:24,440
accessibility issue I called out early in the show.

1855
01:34:24,640 --> 01:34:28,040
You make a good point that could be fixed through this.

1856
01:34:28,240 --> 01:34:31,040
That's a very interesting point to ponder.

1857
01:34:31,240 --> 01:34:32,440
All right.

1858
01:34:32,600 --> 01:34:34,920
Is that maybe, maybe

1859
01:34:35,120 --> 01:34:38,680
that's the only way somebody can actually play this game is through an emulator.

1860
01:34:38,880 --> 01:34:41,800
Now, again, you need to pay the sixty dollars,

1861
01:34:41,800 --> 01:34:45,120
have the cartridge and run the emulator the way that it's supposed to be run.

1862
01:34:45,320 --> 01:34:48,360
But it's a very interesting prospect.

1863
01:34:48,560 --> 01:34:50,360
All right, moving on.

1864
01:34:50,560 --> 01:34:52,440
Let's let's talk more about games that we

1865
01:34:52,640 --> 01:34:58,000
emulate as we take a trip down memory lane in our next segment.

1866
01:35:02,440 --> 01:35:03,440
And

1867
01:35:08,600 --> 01:35:13,600
now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and

1868
01:35:13,800 --> 01:35:16,040
pull out a classic and tell you about it.

1869
01:35:16,240 --> 01:35:20,240
It's time for the classic game of the week.

1870
01:35:20,440 --> 01:35:23,040
It's a good one tonight, DarkSakura. What did you pick?

1871
01:35:23,240 --> 01:35:25,400
I picked System Shock,

1872
01:35:26,400 --> 01:35:32,960
which is a really groundbreaking game, I believe, you know.

1873
01:35:33,160 --> 01:35:37,080
System Shock was released on September twenty third, nineteen ninety four.

1874
01:35:37,280 --> 01:35:39,720
I was in college

1875
01:35:39,920 --> 01:35:44,520
and it is a first person action adventure game that was developed

1876
01:35:44,720 --> 01:35:48,920
by Looking Glass Technologies, published by Origin Systems.

1877
01:35:49,120 --> 01:35:53,760
It is a space station cyberpunk game set

1878
01:35:53,960 --> 01:35:55,840
in twenty seventy two.

1879
01:35:56,040 --> 01:36:01,280
You play a security hacker, an unnamed, you know, person,

1880
01:36:01,480 --> 01:36:11,320
and you are trying to stop a AI called Shodan, S-H-O-D-A-N.

1881
01:36:11,520 --> 01:36:17,640
But it's the big thing about System Shock is that its 3D engine was really,

1882
01:36:17,840 --> 01:36:19,840
really

1883
01:36:20,600 --> 01:36:25,720
new and for the time, really innovative.

1884
01:36:25,920 --> 01:36:29,560
The physics to it, the gameplay,

1885
01:36:29,760 --> 01:36:35,720
it was really some of the most influential to be done at its time.

1886
01:36:35,920 --> 01:36:40,440
And in fact, the the developers actually sort of moved

1887
01:36:40,640 --> 01:36:46,680
from their previous games to push their own envelope with System Shock.

1888
01:36:46,880 --> 01:36:48,720
They had also done Ultima Underworld,

1889
01:36:48,920 --> 01:36:53,320
the Stygian Abyss and Ultima Underworld 2 Labyrinth of Worlds,

1890
01:36:53,520 --> 01:36:56,800
and they wanted to streamline what they had done to that game,

1891
01:36:57,000 --> 01:37:02,080
those games to make things more integrated, to make them work better together.

1892
01:37:02,280 --> 01:37:05,400
It was a real breakthrough at the time.

1893
01:37:06,600 --> 01:37:11,280
It was, I would say, moderately successful when it came out,

1894
01:37:11,480 --> 01:37:14,440
but Looking Glass did lose money on the project.

1895
01:37:14,640 --> 01:37:16,480
However,

1896
01:37:16,680 --> 01:37:23,200
they did proceed with a sequel and a tertiary release.

1897
01:37:23,400 --> 01:37:27,240
And there it actually had some

1898
01:37:27,440 --> 01:37:32,160
spiritual successors, including Deus Ex that came out in 2000,

1899
01:37:32,360 --> 01:37:37,680
which was produced and directed by Warren Spector, who was

1900
01:37:37,880 --> 01:37:40,400
the producer for System Shock.

1901
01:37:40,600 --> 01:37:43,040
And then, of course, Bioshock is also

1902
01:37:43,240 --> 01:37:47,280
considered a spiritual successor to both of the games.

1903
01:37:47,480 --> 01:37:51,920
There's actually going to be a remake of System Shock supposedly coming out

1904
01:37:52,120 --> 01:37:57,720
in this year or is it already out, I don't know, by Nightdive Studios.

1905
01:37:57,920 --> 01:38:00,240
At any rate, you play the game first person.

1906
01:38:00,440 --> 01:38:02,920
Like I said, you're in a 3D environment.

1907
01:38:03,120 --> 01:38:06,760
You have this multi-level space station that you can explore.

1908
01:38:06,960 --> 01:38:08,880
You have enemies, you have puzzles.

1909
01:38:08,920 --> 01:38:12,360
It's non-linear, mostly,

1910
01:38:12,560 --> 01:38:16,800
that will allow emergent gameplay.

1911
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:20,160
You can freely move your cursor around to aim objects.

1912
01:38:20,360 --> 01:38:22,520
It is a PC game, by the way.

1913
01:38:22,720 --> 01:38:26,280
You can crouch, you can look up, you can crawl.

1914
01:38:26,480 --> 01:38:28,200
You've got all kinds of different things.

1915
01:38:28,400 --> 01:38:34,120
And your HUD has three different multifunction displays

1916
01:38:34,320 --> 01:38:36,560
that you can configure for different information.

1917
01:38:36,560 --> 01:38:38,440
You have an automap, you have your inventory.

1918
01:38:38,920 --> 01:38:41,480
Layouts, weapon readouts, you name it.

1919
01:38:41,680 --> 01:38:48,040
So you advance the plot by getting log disks and getting your emails.

1920
01:38:48,240 --> 01:38:52,320
There are no NPCs really in the game,

1921
01:38:52,520 --> 01:38:57,280
but you do also have the AI in the game

1922
01:38:57,480 --> 01:39:03,160
that traps and blocks pathways and you get certain information to keep going through.

1923
01:39:03,360 --> 01:39:06,480
You also have this sort of cyberspace

1924
01:39:06,520 --> 01:39:10,920
that you can go through where you move weightlessly through these

1925
01:39:11,120 --> 01:39:13,520
wireframe 3D environments that you can use

1926
01:39:13,720 --> 01:39:17,720
to collect data to fight the security programs by Shodan.

1927
01:39:17,920 --> 01:39:20,240
It's just really immersive.

1928
01:39:20,440 --> 01:39:25,160
And then you also get through different weapons and different tools.

1929
01:39:25,360 --> 01:39:30,280
You'll get a dart pistol, you'll get concussion grenades, land mines,

1930
01:39:30,480 --> 01:39:34,400
and you also get dermal patches and first aid kits to heal yourself.

1931
01:39:34,400 --> 01:39:36,880
You get hardware like energy shields

1932
01:39:37,080 --> 01:39:41,640
and head-mounted lanterns and different things like that.

1933
01:39:43,360 --> 01:39:46,160
And so basically,

1934
01:39:47,040 --> 01:39:51,520
the hacker is the hero.

1935
01:39:51,720 --> 01:39:55,760
So into the design with this game,

1936
01:39:55,960 --> 01:40:02,080
it was first conceived during the end of the development for Ultima Underworld 2.

1937
01:40:02,280 --> 01:40:05,720
So around December 92, January 93,

1938
01:40:05,920 --> 01:40:11,920
the programmer designer, Doug Church, was

1939
01:40:12,120 --> 01:40:17,080
at the Texas headquarters of Origin Systems and working with Looking Glass

1940
01:40:17,280 --> 01:40:22,280
Technologies for their next project. And so they kind of put this together,

1941
01:40:22,480 --> 01:40:29,480
wanted it to be an immersive simulation game, but in a fantasy setting.

1942
01:40:29,480 --> 01:40:33,680
And then they went for the more cyberpunk,

1943
01:40:33,880 --> 01:40:39,160
kind of almost wanting to make this a spin off of Wing Commander, but not quite.

1944
01:40:39,360 --> 01:40:43,360
And so they just put things together.

1945
01:40:43,560 --> 01:40:45,960
They evolved.

1946
01:40:46,160 --> 01:40:50,600
They really put things together and out came this.

1947
01:40:50,800 --> 01:40:52,920
So with its production,

1948
01:40:53,120 --> 01:40:58,360
it did require a new engine that could do true 3D graphics.

1949
01:40:58,440 --> 01:41:03,920
They just chucked the Ultima engine and coded one from scratch.

1950
01:41:04,120 --> 01:41:09,200
They used Wacom C++ and 32-bit code.

1951
01:41:09,400 --> 01:41:11,840
Their new engine could process texture mapping.

1952
01:41:12,040 --> 01:41:15,200
It could use sloped architecture, light emitting objects.

1953
01:41:15,400 --> 01:41:18,000
You could look in any direction.

1954
01:41:18,200 --> 01:41:21,520
It allowed for improved player physics,

1955
01:41:21,720 --> 01:41:27,520
including the jumping, crawling, climbing mechanics.

1956
01:41:27,760 --> 01:41:31,040
They found limitations in their engine

1957
01:41:31,240 --> 01:41:34,640
so that they could push the envelope for what it was able to do.

1958
01:41:34,840 --> 01:41:36,840
They did have 3D character models

1959
01:41:36,840 --> 01:41:39,600
enabled, but they couldn't implement it on their schedule.

1960
01:41:39,800 --> 01:41:41,600
They had triggered events.

1961
01:41:41,800 --> 01:41:44,520
It was really something major for its day.

1962
01:41:44,720 --> 01:41:49,000
The wireframe mechanics were actually, I thought, a really good touch for sort of

1963
01:41:49,200 --> 01:41:56,200
that floating feeling that you were moving through a virtual space.

1964
01:41:56,200 --> 01:42:00,080
So the first release of this came out

1965
01:42:00,280 --> 01:42:03,600
on floppy disks and had no support for spoken dialog.

1966
01:42:03,800 --> 01:42:07,080
Later on, that was September 1994.

1967
01:42:07,280 --> 01:42:11,800
A CD-ROM version was released in December 1994 that had full speech

1968
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:15,480
for the logs and the emails, the multiple display resolutions,

1969
01:42:15,680 --> 01:42:22,200
more detailed graphics, and of course, it is considered to be the superior version.

1970
01:42:22,880 --> 01:42:29,040
So they wanted to

1971
01:42:29,240 --> 01:42:33,600
to actually do these sort of audio vignettes that they

1972
01:42:33,800 --> 01:42:37,160
and they really didn't want to do the floppy version.

1973
01:42:37,360 --> 01:42:41,120
They just wanted the CD one to go out, but

1974
01:42:41,320 --> 01:42:44,520
they had to get something out for release in September.

1975
01:42:44,720 --> 01:42:46,880
So that's why it came out with that.

1976
01:42:47,080 --> 01:42:50,720
It sold over 170,000 copies.

1977
01:42:51,720 --> 01:42:57,320
It was successful, but not enough to keep looking glass afloat as a company

1978
01:42:57,520 --> 01:43:02,480
because it had another competitor, Doom.

1979
01:43:02,680 --> 01:43:06,080
And we know what Doom did,

1980
01:43:06,280 --> 01:43:09,080
but it got a lot of praise for how

1981
01:43:09,280 --> 01:43:13,240
technologically advanced it was and how much more complex it was,

1982
01:43:13,440 --> 01:43:15,720
complicated and complex it was than Doom.

1983
01:43:15,920 --> 01:43:19,200
And it was considered to be worth the time

1984
01:43:19,240 --> 01:43:23,720
it took to play the game, to explore it, to go.

1985
01:43:23,920 --> 01:43:25,520
And there's people because, you know,

1986
01:43:25,520 --> 01:43:29,200
when you release a sort of game at the same time and the other popular,

1987
01:43:29,400 --> 01:43:32,800
people will try to find the similarities between them.

1988
01:43:33,000 --> 01:43:37,520
But this was

1989
01:43:37,720 --> 01:43:39,880
more elaborate, more complicated.

1990
01:43:40,080 --> 01:43:43,880
And even some of the some of the reviewers out there said you have to read

1991
01:43:43,880 --> 01:43:47,040
the manual before you can actually get into the game and that it had a higher

1992
01:43:47,240 --> 01:43:50,560
system requirement with, of course, all those complex controls.

1993
01:43:50,560 --> 01:43:54,920
For me, I would even more put this a little bit more into the realm of dissent

1994
01:43:55,120 --> 01:44:01,320
for, you know, later on for things that kind of had that complication.

1995
01:44:01,520 --> 01:44:04,320
It blended strategy with action.

1996
01:44:04,320 --> 01:44:05,920
You couldn't just go run and gun it.

1997
01:44:06,120 --> 01:44:07,680
You had to think about playing it.

1998
01:44:07,880 --> 01:44:13,480
You know, it was a it was a thinking game.

1999
01:44:13,680 --> 01:44:15,560
Um.

2000
01:44:15,760 --> 01:44:18,080
I'll just say it's interesting that you

2001
01:44:18,280 --> 01:44:22,560
bring up that Doom comparison, because my memory goes, oh,

2002
01:44:22,560 --> 01:44:25,880
this was one of those many games that came out because it was, you know,

2003
01:44:25,880 --> 01:44:29,440
inspired by Doom and everything that was happening in the 3D genre at that time.

2004
01:44:29,440 --> 01:44:32,440
It's interesting the tricks that our memory will play on us.

2005
01:44:32,640 --> 01:44:35,520
But you're you're probably very right in that, you know,

2006
01:44:35,520 --> 01:44:38,440
Doom was something you just, you know, run and gun, pick it up.

2007
01:44:38,440 --> 01:44:39,480
There were contemporaries.

2008
01:44:39,680 --> 01:44:44,120
There was there was much more thinking in this game that maybe made it harder

2009
01:44:44,160 --> 01:44:46,480
to just and that doesn't make it worse or anything.

2010
01:44:46,680 --> 01:44:48,480
It just made it a little harder to get into.

2011
01:44:48,680 --> 01:44:54,680
And I think maybe that's why our brains don't equate this from of the exact same

2012
01:44:54,680 --> 01:44:57,480
era and not one inspired by the other necessarily.

2013
01:44:57,680 --> 01:45:00,280
Well, and it was also a lot more graphically complex.

2014
01:45:00,480 --> 01:45:03,000
I mean, it was the.

2015
01:45:03,200 --> 01:45:07,560
If you look at it, the specification graphic wise, story wise,

2016
01:45:07,760 --> 01:45:09,040
it's the superior game.

2017
01:45:09,240 --> 01:45:10,080
Yeah.

2018
01:45:10,240 --> 01:45:16,560
And it really did set a lot of things that we take for granted in our games today,

2019
01:45:16,760 --> 01:45:19,640
like immersive simulation,

2020
01:45:19,840 --> 01:45:25,640
the whole emergent gameplay style where as you go, you learn more and new things happen.

2021
01:45:25,840 --> 01:45:28,880
And I mean, and again, without this, we wouldn't have Bioshock.

2022
01:45:29,080 --> 01:45:30,240
We wouldn't have Deus Ex.

2023
01:45:30,440 --> 01:45:33,600
We wouldn't have Thief, you know.

2024
01:45:33,800 --> 01:45:35,920
Of course, there was a sequel.

2025
01:45:36,080 --> 01:45:40,960
System Shock 2 came out by Looking Glass and Irrational Games in 1999.

2026
01:45:41,160 --> 01:45:44,240
It really played a lot more on that one.

2027
01:45:44,240 --> 01:45:46,000
And then, of course, Looking Glass closed

2028
01:45:46,200 --> 01:45:49,600
and the rights fell to the Meadowbrook Insurance Group,

2029
01:45:49,800 --> 01:45:53,120
which is a subsidiary of Star Insurance Company.

2030
01:45:53,320 --> 01:45:56,920
And it was then acquired by Nightdive Studios

2031
01:45:57,120 --> 01:46:01,760
and they distributed the game and the rights for System Shock at all.

2032
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:06,200
And they had a plan to release the source code,

2033
01:46:06,400 --> 01:46:11,080
but they did a third game in 2015 called System Shock 3.

2034
01:46:11,280 --> 01:46:12,160
Sorry, I take that back.

2035
01:46:12,360 --> 01:46:16,400
That was developed by Otherside Entertainment.

2036
01:46:17,280 --> 01:46:23,400
And yeah, there's it was not as well received as any of the others.

2037
01:46:23,600 --> 01:46:27,680
So Nightdive Studios, being that they own the rights to System Shock are planning

2038
01:46:27,680 --> 01:46:33,480
on doing well, they did System Shock Enhanced Edition that came out

2039
01:46:33,680 --> 01:46:39,800
on GOG on September 22nd, 2015 for Windows.

2040
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:42,120
The version

2041
01:46:42,320 --> 01:46:47,440
needed definitely some more improvements to boost up the resolution.

2042
01:46:47,640 --> 01:46:52,120
It also does include the original version of the game, which is System Shock Classic

2043
01:46:52,320 --> 01:46:57,880
with support for Windows OS X and Linux, Mac OS X.

2044
01:46:58,080 --> 01:47:00,480
It received really positive reviews,

2045
01:47:00,680 --> 01:47:06,080
but Nightdive Studios wants to do a reimagining of System Shock to come out

2046
01:47:06,280 --> 01:47:12,920
for Windows, Xbox One and PlayStation 4 using Unreal Engine 4.

2047
01:47:13,120 --> 01:47:14,440
But

2048
01:47:14,640 --> 01:47:17,760
there's not really, I think, a whole lot else about that.

2049
01:47:17,800 --> 01:47:20,160
But Otherside Entertainment also wants

2050
01:47:20,360 --> 01:47:24,040
to acquire the license to System Shock

2051
01:47:24,240 --> 01:47:29,040
to improve on System Shock 3 to redevelop it.

2052
01:47:29,240 --> 01:47:35,760
But the Mac version source code was released by Nightdive Studios on GitHub.

2053
01:47:35,960 --> 01:47:39,640
And there is also

2054
01:47:40,360 --> 01:47:42,200
a

2055
01:47:42,400 --> 01:47:46,200
after a month of development, there's a cross platform source port called

2056
01:47:46,360 --> 01:47:48,080
Shocklet

2057
01:47:48,280 --> 01:47:51,400
that has been released for developers.

2058
01:47:51,600 --> 01:47:55,000
So there we go. That is the state of the System Shock.

2059
01:47:55,200 --> 01:47:56,240
Good pick, Dark Sakura.

2060
01:47:56,240 --> 01:47:59,840
This is one that, you know, I knew of this game and I think I even may have played

2061
01:47:59,840 --> 01:48:02,440
it a little bit, but I think it was one of those games I was probably pretty easily

2062
01:48:02,440 --> 01:48:05,520
overwhelmed with because, yeah, that would have been right around the time, too.

2063
01:48:05,520 --> 01:48:08,080
It would have been like either early college or late high school for me.

2064
01:48:08,280 --> 01:48:10,200
And I probably blew this game off pretty quickly.

2065
01:48:10,400 --> 01:48:12,880
But it is very interesting how much this

2066
01:48:12,880 --> 01:48:16,320
was brought to the table that wasn't on the table yet,

2067
01:48:16,520 --> 01:48:21,320
but then kind of became a part of it much later on, if that makes sense.

2068
01:48:21,520 --> 01:48:23,160
So, no, indeed. All right.

2069
01:48:23,360 --> 01:48:27,160
Well, there it is. Classic game of the week is System Shock.

2070
01:48:27,360 --> 01:48:32,920
All right. Let's get to our next segment and some rapid fire news.

2071
01:48:33,120 --> 01:48:35,560
Just real quick, housekeeping note.

2072
01:48:35,760 --> 01:48:40,240
We will be here next week and next week will be episode number 888,

2073
01:48:40,360 --> 01:48:42,760
which is a bit of a lucky number there, so that'll be fun.

2074
01:48:42,960 --> 01:48:44,520
So we will be here next week.

2075
01:48:44,720 --> 01:48:49,680
We will not be here in two weeks live as I will be out.

2076
01:48:49,680 --> 01:48:53,600
I'm going to actually be at Disneyland in two weeks, so I can't wait.

2077
01:48:53,800 --> 01:48:55,600
And then three weeks is Halloween.

2078
01:48:55,600 --> 01:48:57,080
So we're still trying to work out the plan.

2079
01:48:57,280 --> 01:49:02,920
I think I will be on Twitch that night one way or another because I don't do anything.

2080
01:49:03,120 --> 01:49:04,840
I mean, I do things for Halloween.

2081
01:49:04,840 --> 01:49:06,840
I'm actually hosting two shows that weekend.

2082
01:49:07,040 --> 01:49:08,440
So shout out for local folks.

2083
01:49:09,000 --> 01:49:12,240
Well, Rocky Horror is almost sold out now, but I think there's like 10 seats left.

2084
01:49:12,440 --> 01:49:14,320
If you want to try and get a general mission ticket

2085
01:49:14,520 --> 01:49:17,440
at the Colonial on that Saturday, the 30th.

2086
01:49:17,640 --> 01:49:19,280
So I have plans Friday.

2087
01:49:19,480 --> 01:49:22,800
I'm hosting another show, a burlesque variety show that Friday night.

2088
01:49:23,000 --> 01:49:24,520
Then I'm hosting Rocky that Saturday.

2089
01:49:24,520 --> 01:49:26,840
So it's weird to be talking about hosting shows again, but hooray.

2090
01:49:27,040 --> 01:49:29,280
But then Sunday, I'm not doing anything on Halloween.

2091
01:49:29,320 --> 01:49:32,160
So I will have gotten Halloween out of my system the other two nights.

2092
01:49:32,160 --> 01:49:34,520
So I'll be here. But, Loki, I know you have kids and you

2093
01:49:34,520 --> 01:49:38,200
might not be able to get out of the show that easy or get out of it to do the show that easy.

2094
01:49:38,200 --> 01:49:40,280
I don't know where Jamie's at, so we'll see.

2095
01:49:40,280 --> 01:49:43,840
I'll be here on Twitch one way or the other, but we'll see where my co-hosts are.

2096
01:49:44,040 --> 01:49:45,240
So. All right.

2097
01:49:45,440 --> 01:49:48,720
If we can't all be here together, we'll try to do a show throughout the week

2098
01:49:48,920 --> 01:49:50,320
or something, so we have that.

2099
01:49:50,520 --> 01:49:53,080
OK, um, rapid fire news.

2100
01:49:53,080 --> 01:49:55,200
Now we can get into it. Loki.

2101
01:49:56,840 --> 01:49:59,240
You're muted.

2102
01:49:59,440 --> 01:50:00,800
I need I swear I hit the button.

2103
01:50:00,800 --> 01:50:02,800
I know I need a big neon alert.

2104
01:50:02,800 --> 01:50:04,600
All right. Oh, I didn't realize that there's a new

2105
01:50:04,600 --> 01:50:07,600
Doctor Who premiering on ten thirty one, says Pod Culture.

2106
01:50:07,800 --> 01:50:10,640
Oh, I now I see where you all got to be.

2107
01:50:10,640 --> 01:50:13,120
All right, go ahead.

2108
01:50:13,320 --> 01:50:17,960
So as we've been kind of getting rumors that this might be coming,

2109
01:50:18,160 --> 01:50:25,680
we finally got an official announcement that, yes, the Grand Theft Auto trilogy

2110
01:50:25,880 --> 01:50:28,800
was a definitive edition and, you know, there's a subtitle.

2111
01:50:29,000 --> 01:50:34,520
Yeah, the definitive edition is going to be released later this year by Rockstar Games.

2112
01:50:34,720 --> 01:50:36,160
Yes, Rockstar Games,

2113
01:50:36,360 --> 01:50:41,760
the infamous company that likes to perpetuate the old Grand Theft Auto games

2114
01:50:41,760 --> 01:50:43,760
and doesn't make new Grand Theft Auto games anymore.

2115
01:50:43,960 --> 01:50:48,000
But they're going to have the old ones release again.

2116
01:50:48,200 --> 01:50:49,360
And am I excited about it?

2117
01:50:49,560 --> 01:50:57,040
No, because I already have Grand Theft Auto Vice City and three and San Andreas.

2118
01:50:57,240 --> 01:51:01,440
But Loki, these are the definitive editions.

2119
01:51:01,560 --> 01:51:02,960
You

2120
01:51:03,240 --> 01:51:07,680
they will have done literally nothing to it, I'm sure.

2121
01:51:07,880 --> 01:51:09,200
So that's the thing.

2122
01:51:09,400 --> 01:51:12,400
Look forward to that, I guess, or something.

2123
01:51:12,600 --> 01:51:18,400
And then to make things even more exciting, the Avengers game.

2124
01:51:18,600 --> 01:51:20,560
You remember that game by Eidos?

2125
01:51:20,760 --> 01:51:22,160
Well, I do.

2126
01:51:22,360 --> 01:51:25,800
I was going to download it and then it was one hundred and ninety gigabytes to get

2127
01:51:26,000 --> 01:51:30,160
that on Game Pass and I was like, so, yeah, go check it out if it's on Game Pass.

2128
01:51:30,400 --> 01:51:33,920
But cloud games, I might try it through the cloud gaming thing.

2129
01:51:34,120 --> 01:51:34,760
It's on there, too.

2130
01:51:34,960 --> 01:51:37,320
So there was a thing that they had done.

2131
01:51:37,320 --> 01:51:41,400
They did some tweaks to leveling in the game because they thought it was too easy

2132
01:51:41,600 --> 01:51:46,240
to get to a higher level in the game, and so they had tweaked the leveling

2133
01:51:46,440 --> 01:51:50,600
to make it harder to level up and people didn't like that.

2134
01:51:50,800 --> 01:51:51,880
Like what? You know that.

2135
01:51:52,080 --> 01:51:55,400
But they're like, well, it's maybe confusing,

2136
01:51:55,600 --> 01:51:58,880
overwhelming to newer players that they're leveling too fast.

2137
01:51:59,080 --> 01:52:00,880
Well, now

2138
01:52:01,280 --> 01:52:05,440
apparently it comes out that, well, the reason why they probably did that is

2139
01:52:05,640 --> 01:52:09,480
because they're selling XP boosts now so that you can level up faster.

2140
01:52:09,680 --> 01:52:10,240
That's right.

2141
01:52:10,440 --> 01:52:15,840
They're providing a solution at a cost to a problem that they created.

2142
01:52:16,640 --> 01:52:21,880
That's your triple A capitalist game mentality.

2143
01:52:22,080 --> 01:52:23,720
Another reason not to play this game.

2144
01:52:23,920 --> 01:52:25,920
So, all right, we'll get to it.

2145
01:52:26,120 --> 01:52:28,560
We'll get to Jamie's rapid fire news stories in just a moment.

2146
01:52:28,560 --> 01:52:30,200
But first, I'm looking at chat for some

2147
01:52:30,400 --> 01:52:32,640

2148
01:52:32,840 --> 01:52:35,280
S.H.O. 100 Matt says GTA 6 is never going

2149
01:52:35,280 --> 01:52:37,640
to live up to the hype whenever it when it ever comes out.

2150
01:52:37,840 --> 01:52:38,680
Do you think that's the first?

2151
01:52:38,880 --> 01:52:43,440
Do you think Grand Theft Auto 6 can possibly live up to this hype of many years?

2152
01:52:43,640 --> 01:52:45,320
You do? Yes.

2153
01:52:45,520 --> 01:52:48,120
Grand Theft Auto 5 lived up to the hype and 4 was amazing.

2154
01:52:48,320 --> 01:52:49,800
So I don't see why not.

2155
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:51,960
Except for the multiplayer.

2156
01:52:52,160 --> 01:52:57,200
Well, you know, the multiplayer in 5 is all it's just.

2157
01:52:57,400 --> 01:53:00,000
I don't necessarily like the sandbox multiplayer.

2158
01:53:00,200 --> 01:53:04,640
I liked how 4 had the option, like if you want the sandbox multiplayer,

2159
01:53:04,840 --> 01:53:08,920
you can do that, or if you want it, you know, specific just levels or whatever

2160
01:53:09,120 --> 01:53:11,360
to do like a deathmatch and you could do that.

2161
01:53:11,560 --> 01:53:16,000
I liked how you had like options and they still kind of have that in this.

2162
01:53:16,200 --> 01:53:18,280
But it's.

2163
01:53:18,480 --> 01:53:25,280
It's clearly meant to force you to grind for money, and they clearly built it

2164
01:53:25,280 --> 01:53:27,120
in a way to push those shark cards.

2165
01:53:27,320 --> 01:53:29,680
And fortunately, based on the revenue

2166
01:53:29,680 --> 01:53:32,160
that they're making with Grand Theft Auto Online, it's working.

2167
01:53:32,360 --> 01:53:36,520
And so that's a problem is once you've given them such an easy source of cash,

2168
01:53:36,720 --> 01:53:39,240
they're going to keep perpetuating that, unfortunately.

2169
01:53:39,240 --> 01:53:40,880
And so they're not really motivated

2170
01:53:41,080 --> 01:53:44,760
to make a new game until they've run this one dry.

2171
01:53:44,960 --> 01:53:48,680
It's the Activision of the music game worlds or anything that they,

2172
01:53:48,880 --> 01:53:54,240
you know, Activision touches Rockstar Games is kind of learning that lesson

2173
01:53:54,440 --> 01:53:59,360
themselves where they are just going to milk this until they, you know, trillionaires.

2174
01:53:59,560 --> 01:54:03,920
And so we will probably see a Grand Theft Auto six until Grand Theft Auto Online

2175
01:54:04,120 --> 01:54:06,600
and Grand Theft Auto five's numbers drop.

2176
01:54:06,800 --> 01:54:08,280
They're working on it, who knows?

2177
01:54:08,480 --> 01:54:11,280
Before we get to Jamie stories, Tiger Claw on chat says, oh,

2178
01:54:11,480 --> 01:54:13,760
you guys didn't mention about the trailer for Resident Evil.

2179
01:54:13,960 --> 01:54:15,280
Welcome to Raccoon City.

2180
01:54:15,480 --> 01:54:20,360
It's because I so rarely get into TV shows and Netflix movies and that stuff anymore.

2181
01:54:20,960 --> 01:54:23,520
I full on meant I sat down

2182
01:54:23,720 --> 01:54:28,160
on Friday night because I was very bored and I full on meant to start Squid Game

2183
01:54:28,160 --> 01:54:30,080
because everybody's talking about Squid Games.

2184
01:54:30,080 --> 01:54:31,120
I want to watch that.

2185
01:54:31,120 --> 01:54:32,760
Everybody's been talking about it nonstop.

2186
01:54:32,960 --> 01:54:34,800
But maybe we should watch it together, Jamie.

2187
01:54:35,000 --> 01:54:36,600
Let's do it. Oh, my God.

2188
01:54:36,800 --> 01:54:38,360
Let's have a live reaction.

2189
01:54:38,560 --> 01:54:41,960
I don't I don't think we can do that because we can't show the show.

2190
01:54:41,960 --> 01:54:43,360
We could just show ourselves. I don't know.

2191
01:54:43,480 --> 01:54:45,200
Yeah, we'll show ourselves talking shit about it.

2192
01:54:45,400 --> 01:54:47,520
But anyway, here's the thing.

2193
01:54:47,560 --> 01:54:50,600
No, I meant to watch it, but then you know what happened?

2194
01:54:50,800 --> 01:54:57,440
Instead, on my suggestion that Leah Remini escaping Scientology thing came up.

2195
01:54:57,640 --> 01:55:01,520
I watched like four episodes of that in a night.

2196
01:55:01,720 --> 01:55:03,960
It was compelling, God damn it.

2197
01:55:04,160 --> 01:55:06,920
Anyway, it's so interesting.

2198
01:55:07,120 --> 01:55:09,800
Anyway, let's see.

2199
01:55:10,000 --> 01:55:11,240
Can I do my stuff now?

2200
01:55:11,440 --> 01:55:13,080
Yes, you can do your stuff now.

2201
01:55:13,240 --> 01:55:16,800
OK, so there is going to be an Animal

2202
01:55:17,000 --> 01:55:23,400
Crossing direct scheduled on Brewster's birthday, or as he is known in

2203
01:55:23,600 --> 01:55:27,760
in the Japanese version, Maestro, I believe it's either Maestro or Maestro.

2204
01:55:27,960 --> 01:55:29,360
I'll have to look it up again.

2205
01:55:29,560 --> 01:55:32,480
But anyway, it's going to be on the Nintendo YouTube

2206
01:55:32,680 --> 01:55:37,040
channel on October 15th, and I finally have a reason to play the game again.

2207
01:55:37,240 --> 01:55:39,000
Because Brewster.

2208
01:55:39,200 --> 01:55:42,520
I have a Brewster plushie like somewhere behind me, so

2209
01:55:42,720 --> 01:55:45,680
anyway, and you have a catch up.

2210
01:55:45,880 --> 01:55:49,360
I do have a catch up, and I'm also very excited for this direct because I want

2211
01:55:49,560 --> 01:55:54,480
reasons to go back and visit my town because I abandoned them about a year ago.

2212
01:55:54,680 --> 01:56:01,680
Well, there is also a new addition to the arcade archives for Namco,

2213
01:56:01,880 --> 01:56:07,840
the the Genji and Heike clan is joining in amongst those.

2214
01:56:08,040 --> 01:56:10,240
So you will.

2215
01:56:10,480 --> 01:56:15,480
And for anyone who doesn't know anything about the Genji and Heike clans,

2216
01:56:15,680 --> 01:56:21,360
it actually is going back from like really old Japanese literature.

2217
01:56:21,560 --> 01:56:25,240
So but it's it's a really honestly,

2218
01:56:25,440 --> 01:56:30,480
it's a really beautiful game and I'm glad to see it in there.

2219
01:56:30,680 --> 01:56:32,400
Yeah, it's interesting that this arcade

2220
01:56:32,600 --> 01:56:35,480
archives has gone so deep now, we're really getting into these

2221
01:56:35,680 --> 01:56:39,320
underappreciated classics, you know, this is pretty, pretty cool.

2222
01:56:39,480 --> 01:56:40,320
All right.

2223
01:56:40,520 --> 01:56:43,320
Certain games that didn't see a lot of light in the US.

2224
01:56:43,520 --> 01:56:44,760
Yeah.

2225
01:56:44,960 --> 01:56:46,000
That's very true.

2226
01:56:46,200 --> 01:56:47,560
All right, let's travel around the world

2227
01:56:47,560 --> 01:56:50,640

2244
01:58:04,200 --> 01:58:08,040
Going to Japan and looking at the releases there on the Switch on October 14th,

2245
01:58:08,040 --> 01:58:11,360
we have Monarch in regular and limited edition coming out of Japan.

2246
01:58:11,560 --> 01:58:13,480
We have a game called Fight of Animals.

2247
01:58:13,480 --> 01:58:15,400
Arena is coming out as well in Japan.

2248
01:58:15,600 --> 01:58:17,520
I know this game exists here.

2249
01:58:17,720 --> 01:58:20,040
Is it the same name here?

2250
01:58:20,240 --> 01:58:21,120
Fight of Animals?

2251
01:58:21,320 --> 01:58:25,080
It's Smash Brothers, but with like really overly character.

2252
01:58:25,280 --> 01:58:29,560
I think it is. OK, I don't remember the name of it, but yeah, it's over here.

2253
01:58:29,600 --> 01:58:31,560
OK, it's like a cat, but the cat is like

2254
01:58:31,760 --> 01:58:35,840
super muscle cat and like it's just Smash Brothers with all these animals.

2255
01:58:35,960 --> 01:58:36,920
There's a whale in it.

2256
01:58:37,120 --> 01:58:40,080
It looks that I don't know if it's the same name.

2257
01:58:40,080 --> 01:58:41,320
It's what Brutal should have been.

2258
01:58:41,520 --> 01:58:44,720
I know I've seen this game over here because I was thinking, oh,

2259
01:58:44,720 --> 01:58:47,760
that would be a fun thing to pick up. But Japan's getting it this week.

2260
01:58:47,960 --> 01:58:52,440
Earth Defense Force 3 gets its Nintendo Switch release this week over in Japan.

2261
01:58:52,640 --> 01:58:55,160
And I think that is it for the Switch.

2262
01:58:55,360 --> 01:58:58,440
So let me quickly take a look at the PlayStation 5

2263
01:58:58,640 --> 01:59:00,200
and look at the releases there.

2264
01:59:00,400 --> 01:59:02,680
If I can ever get down to.

2265
01:59:04,160 --> 01:59:07,400
Sorry, I need an actual mouse for this thing I'm using now.

2266
01:59:07,600 --> 01:59:11,560
It's the worst to have to use a touchpad touchpad.

2267
01:59:12,560 --> 01:59:18,040
OK, on the PlayStation 5, we have Demon Slayer, Kimetsu no Yaiba,

2268
01:59:18,240 --> 01:59:22,240
Hinokami Kaputan comes out this week, and that is on the PlayStation 5.

2269
01:59:22,440 --> 01:59:26,760
And the Monarch is also seeing a PlayStation 5 release this week.

2270
01:59:26,960 --> 01:59:28,480
That's it.

2271
01:59:29,080 --> 01:59:31,560
So how about the UK, Dark Soccer?

2272
01:59:34,200 --> 01:59:38,440
On the UK, we have on the 12th, we have

2273
01:59:38,640 --> 01:59:41,240
Shuan Yan Sword 7.

2274
01:59:41,440 --> 01:59:47,480
That's going to be PlayStation, Xbox also the same day, same systems back for blood.

2275
01:59:47,680 --> 01:59:54,600
On the 14th, we have the Rift Breaker, same systems, 15th, NHL 22,

2276
01:59:54,800 --> 01:59:59,520
Crisis Remastered, Demon Slayer, Kimetsu no Yaiba,

2277
01:59:59,720 --> 02:00:05,160
I got tongue tied, Kimetsu no Yaiba, the Hinokami Chronicles.

2278
02:00:05,360 --> 02:00:10,920
We have also on the 15th, Story of Seasons, Friends of Mineral Town,

2279
02:00:11,120 --> 02:00:14,640
and then Just Die Already.

2280
02:00:14,840 --> 02:00:16,520
On a bunch of stuff.

2281
02:00:17,760 --> 02:00:20,000
All right, is that it?

2282
02:00:20,200 --> 02:00:22,960
That's it. I will have you know, I looked up that animal game.

2283
02:00:22,960 --> 02:00:25,520
It is also called Fight of Animals here locally.

2284
02:00:25,520 --> 02:00:26,720
That's what I thought. Yeah.

2285
02:00:26,920 --> 02:00:29,080
And actually, it's been out. I think it's on Steam.

2286
02:00:29,280 --> 02:00:33,360
It is. It is on Steam and it went up on Steam December of 2019.

2287
02:00:33,560 --> 02:00:35,000
So this game's been out a little while.

2288
02:00:35,000 --> 02:00:37,800
It's just Japan is getting a Switch release of it this week.

2289
02:00:38,000 --> 02:00:40,280
So I'm like, I knew I've seen this game around.

2290
02:00:40,480 --> 02:00:41,840
I might have to get it on Switch.

2291
02:00:41,880 --> 02:00:42,960
Yeah, that'd be a lot of fun.

2292
02:00:43,160 --> 02:00:44,920
So, yeah. All right.

2293
02:00:45,120 --> 02:00:47,800
We are going to now get back into some news.

2294
02:00:48,000 --> 02:00:50,840
We're also going to invite your phone calls later in the show,

2295
02:00:51,040 --> 02:00:53,840
as well as possibly any emails, if we actually got any.

2296
02:00:54,040 --> 02:00:58,160
Participate at Orangelandtrady.com if you want to be old school and send an email.

2297
02:00:58,360 --> 02:01:00,000
But send an email for now.

2298
02:01:00,200 --> 02:01:01,600
We have a few more stories.

2299
02:01:01,800 --> 02:01:02,760
Loki.

2300
02:01:02,960 --> 02:01:07,920
Yeah, so right now, the Ryoga Gotoku

2301
02:01:08,120 --> 02:01:11,480
studio, the developer, of course, behind the Yakuza series,

2302
02:01:11,480 --> 02:01:13,000
they're going through a restructure right now.

2303
02:01:13,200 --> 02:01:17,360
They've had some folks leaving the studio,

2304
02:01:17,520 --> 02:01:25,080
including the departure of the series creator and game director, Tosho.

2305
02:01:25,280 --> 02:01:28,720
I'm going to let me butcher some Japanese names.

2306
02:01:28,920 --> 02:01:32,560
Toshihiro Nagoshi.

2307
02:01:32,760 --> 02:01:38,240
He has left, as well as the.

2308
02:01:38,440 --> 02:01:41,880
Was it the former series producer as well in the in the creator?

2309
02:01:41,880 --> 02:01:43,320
So.

2310
02:01:44,800 --> 02:01:47,680
That's quite a few people leaving

2311
02:01:47,880 --> 02:01:49,680
and then, of course, along with this,

2312
02:01:49,880 --> 02:01:53,720
we did get the news that there is going to be a sequel to Yakuza,

2313
02:01:53,720 --> 02:01:57,600
like a dragon, which I'm very excited about and I actually need to finish that game.

2314
02:01:57,800 --> 02:02:00,000
But yeah, a little bit of a restructure

2315
02:02:00,200 --> 02:02:03,760
with some of those big heads of the company leaving.

2316
02:02:06,520 --> 02:02:07,640
But.

2317
02:02:07,840 --> 02:02:08,920
I'm excited for the series.

2318
02:02:09,080 --> 02:02:11,040
Yeah, looking in chat, S.J. 100 Matt says,

2319
02:02:11,040 --> 02:02:13,400
at least they said like a dragon two is still happening.

2320
02:02:13,600 --> 02:02:15,600
Maybe I'll be like a dragon one by them.

2321
02:02:15,800 --> 02:02:19,000
Big mood, Matt, because I still have Bobby.

2322
02:02:19,200 --> 02:02:22,680
Bobby is like hiding in the bushes outside going, you beat like a dragon yet?

2323
02:02:22,880 --> 02:02:25,160
You played like a dragon yet?

2324
02:02:25,360 --> 02:02:27,560
So I need to I need to know.

2325
02:02:27,760 --> 02:02:30,600
I have one game I own on the Xbox Series X.

2326
02:02:30,800 --> 02:02:34,680
I need to be I need to be careful because I don't want to pass that point where I

2327
02:02:34,680 --> 02:02:37,720
can't just pick up where I left off and I have to start all over again,

2328
02:02:37,880 --> 02:02:40,160
because, you know, it be like that with some RPGs.

2329
02:02:40,280 --> 02:02:43,720
If you let it go for too long, then you're like, where was I at in the story?

2330
02:02:43,920 --> 02:02:45,840
Ah, fuck it. I'll start from the beginning.

2331
02:02:46,040 --> 02:02:47,480
Maybe I'll maybe I'll do things different.

2332
02:02:47,680 --> 02:02:50,040
Maybe I'll know to save three million yen this time.

2333
02:02:50,240 --> 02:02:54,880
So anyway, I need I need to watch myself and get back into that soon.

2334
02:02:55,080 --> 02:02:57,480
Maybe Bobby, maybe I'm not going to promise,

2335
02:02:57,680 --> 02:03:02,000
but maybe that'll be a game that I do a stream of next week.

2336
02:03:02,200 --> 02:03:04,280
We'll see. I'm not going to stream Monday because

2337
02:03:04,280 --> 02:03:08,920
Jamie's got her thing going on, but maybe maybe one of the other days I stream.

2338
02:03:08,920 --> 02:03:10,440
I still want to do another play through a dread.

2339
02:03:10,440 --> 02:03:12,400
So maybe it'll be later in the week, like a Thursday, Friday thing.

2340
02:03:12,600 --> 02:03:14,720
We'll see. All right.

2341
02:03:15,560 --> 02:03:18,320
Anyhow, let's move on

2342
02:03:18,520 --> 02:03:21,240
and talk about this. Oh, talk about adding games to the backlog.

2343
02:03:21,440 --> 02:03:26,400
Well, here we go. A long running rumor on Orange Launch Radio and really here at all

2344
02:03:26,600 --> 02:03:30,120
of VOG Network finally coming to fruition this week as we have had

2345
02:03:30,160 --> 02:03:34,640
the confirmation that a Tron arcade one up is happening.

2346
02:03:34,840 --> 02:03:36,760
But that's actually not the leading

2347
02:03:36,760 --> 02:03:40,880
headline for a lot of sites reporting on this, because a lot of people are catching

2348
02:03:41,080 --> 02:03:45,560
the fact that Ridge Racer is also one of the cabinets that's being released.

2349
02:03:45,760 --> 02:03:47,600
Loki's asked many times on this program.

2350
02:03:47,600 --> 02:03:49,360
I think Dark Soccer's asked it, too, quite frankly.

2351
02:03:49,560 --> 02:03:51,400
When are we getting a new Ridge Racer?

2352
02:03:51,600 --> 02:03:54,560
Well, here's something.

2353
02:03:54,760 --> 02:03:57,560
It's something. It's not new.

2354
02:03:57,760 --> 02:04:00,880
Anyway, Arcade One Up is doing a Ridge Racer cabinet.

2355
02:04:01,080 --> 02:04:02,280
It has five games in it.

2356
02:04:02,480 --> 02:04:08,440
Ridge Racer, Ridge Racer 2, Rave Racer, Ace Driver and Ace Driver Victory Lap.

2357
02:04:08,640 --> 02:04:10,160
So that's kind of neat.

2358
02:04:10,360 --> 02:04:13,480
Also, what's interesting, some of those games

2359
02:04:13,680 --> 02:04:17,000
have not been on home consoles or even PC.

2360
02:04:17,200 --> 02:04:18,880
So this is really the first time you can

2361
02:04:19,080 --> 02:04:22,080
have them in your house, which is kind of awesome.

2362
02:04:22,280 --> 02:04:24,680
So this is really the only way you can do

2363
02:04:24,720 --> 02:04:28,960
this and play these games unless you happen to own the arcade machines.

2364
02:04:29,160 --> 02:04:32,280
It's especially noted that Rave Racer is

2365
02:04:32,480 --> 02:04:35,960
kind of a neat entry to be here in this particular list.

2366
02:04:36,160 --> 02:04:37,640
That's pretty cool. Yeah.

2367
02:04:37,840 --> 02:04:40,200
Dark Soccer. They're not R4.

2368
02:04:40,400 --> 02:04:44,960
When do we get the Wangan Midnight Maximum Tune Arcade One Up cabinet?

2369
02:04:45,160 --> 02:04:47,400
I wish. Those are a little too recent.

2370
02:04:47,600 --> 02:04:49,800
I well, yeah, they're up to like number eight.

2371
02:04:49,800 --> 02:04:53,640
I think when I was at round one last, I saw initial D is like on eight or nine

2372
02:04:53,680 --> 02:04:55,120
and Wangan's around the same number.

2373
02:04:55,320 --> 02:04:57,200
I'm like, I'm so old or I'll take it.

2374
02:04:57,400 --> 02:05:03,800
I'll take it. Then I then I launched 2DX 28 style and I was like back in my day.

2375
02:05:05,840 --> 02:05:09,520
And then I went on to the local Discord and saw that they were talking about they

2376
02:05:09,720 --> 02:05:14,640
couldn't play a game because one of the Bahmani Boomers was hogging the machine.

2377
02:05:14,840 --> 02:05:16,520
Somebody actually used that term.

2378
02:05:16,640 --> 02:05:17,880
I don't think they were talking about me

2379
02:05:17,880 --> 02:05:19,880
because when I was there, like nobody else there.

2380
02:05:20,000 --> 02:05:22,520
But I I fucking laughed my ass off.

2381
02:05:22,720 --> 02:05:24,920
Dark Soccer Loki were Bahmani Boomers.

2382
02:05:25,120 --> 02:05:26,760
Did you know that?

2383
02:05:27,280 --> 02:05:29,760
At least they have a name for us now.

2384
02:05:30,600 --> 02:05:32,120
They still know how to play Deluxe.

2385
02:05:32,320 --> 02:05:35,320
That person got yelled at and said, don't use that term and all that stuff.

2386
02:05:35,320 --> 02:05:37,360
And so I was like, OK, they're behaving.

2387
02:05:37,560 --> 02:05:38,600
I think it's funny.

2388
02:05:38,800 --> 02:05:40,400
Yeah, I think it's funny, too, actually.

2389
02:05:40,600 --> 02:05:42,280
So it's just it's just so funny.

2390
02:05:42,480 --> 02:05:47,840
It's it's interesting for me to think there are all these like DDR and Bahmani

2391
02:05:47,840 --> 02:05:50,800
or at least there's I know of at least one that's been brought to my attention.

2392
02:05:50,800 --> 02:05:51,760
I think there might be two.

2393
02:05:51,960 --> 02:05:54,160
There's podcasts now about that.

2394
02:05:54,360 --> 02:05:56,360
And they're probably did it first.

2395
02:05:56,360 --> 02:05:57,680
I know they're probably doing those

2396
02:05:57,880 --> 02:06:00,960
shows thinking no one's ever done this before.

2397
02:06:01,160 --> 02:06:04,920
We did, but I think and no one I think it's adorable.

2398
02:06:04,920 --> 02:06:06,560
I think it's adorable. You know what?

2399
02:06:06,760 --> 02:06:11,360
I'm always about going to the next generation and all that stuff.

2400
02:06:11,560 --> 02:06:15,080
Maybe they will find that same love we did

2401
02:06:15,080 --> 02:06:18,200
and end up continuing their show 20 years later about all sorts of things.

2402
02:06:18,200 --> 02:06:19,960
So we'll still be doing ours.

2403
02:06:20,160 --> 02:06:24,360
All right. Anyway, speaking of things, boomers like we

2404
02:06:24,560 --> 02:06:28,000
also have Tron that cabinet is officially happening.

2405
02:06:28,200 --> 02:06:31,160
Yay. Also, Killer Instinct is also and I

2406
02:06:31,160 --> 02:06:32,840
bet there's a lot of people interested in that one, too.

2407
02:06:32,840 --> 02:06:34,880
That is a cabinet that's happening as well.

2408
02:06:35,080 --> 02:06:38,760
Killer Instinct also comes with Battletoads.

2409
02:06:38,960 --> 02:06:40,480
So that's like a combo thing.

2410
02:06:40,480 --> 02:06:41,760
The arcade battle rare.

2411
02:06:41,960 --> 02:06:44,640
Yeah. So that's pretty cool.

2412
02:06:44,880 --> 02:06:47,360
Tron preorders begin October 19th.

2413
02:06:47,560 --> 02:06:49,560
It also has discs of Tron.

2414
02:06:49,760 --> 02:06:52,360
Here's the thing. Yes, this has been brought to my attention.

2415
02:06:52,560 --> 02:06:54,040
Somebody sent me the target listing.

2416
02:06:54,240 --> 02:06:57,880
The target listing was like seven hundred dollars and.

2417
02:06:58,080 --> 02:07:00,280
I just I can't I can't spend that right now.

2418
02:07:00,280 --> 02:07:03,520
It's like you could buy the actual cabinet for that kind of money.

2419
02:07:03,720 --> 02:07:05,440
Yeah, an actual cabinet.

2420
02:07:05,640 --> 02:07:08,880
Look, I would spoil myself rotten anyway.

2421
02:07:08,880 --> 02:07:10,840
I like the idea of the whole black light

2422
02:07:10,840 --> 02:07:12,960
refractive, which I think the original cabinet had.

2423
02:07:13,000 --> 02:07:15,720
I fully expect when I visit Bobby Blackwolf

2424
02:07:15,920 --> 02:07:18,880
for Dragon Con twenty twenty two and go to his arcade again.

2425
02:07:18,880 --> 02:07:20,880
I guess I just invited myself to Bobby's house again.

2426
02:07:21,080 --> 02:07:23,640
But I fully expect I'll get to play that Tron machine.

2427
02:07:23,840 --> 02:07:26,200
I know he'll have it in his house.

2428
02:07:26,400 --> 02:07:31,920
And Bobby is pointing out you cannot buy the actual cabinet, not one that works.

2429
02:07:32,120 --> 02:07:34,800
They those older machines are getting more expensive.

2430
02:07:34,800 --> 02:07:36,440
It's because of the TVs in them.

2431
02:07:36,640 --> 02:07:39,240
They're they're getting impossible to replace these days.

2432
02:07:39,440 --> 02:07:41,200
Yeah, I know all about that.

2433
02:07:41,200 --> 02:07:42,040
Yeah, exactly.

2434
02:07:42,080 --> 02:07:43,080
So that's what's happening.

2435
02:07:43,280 --> 02:07:48,400
Probably Loki, probably 10 years ago when like we were at the auction out

2436
02:07:48,400 --> 02:07:50,960
in Roseville looking at these cabinets, you're right.

2437
02:07:51,160 --> 02:07:55,120
I distinctly remember passing up a burger time machine for four hundred dollars.

2438
02:07:55,320 --> 02:07:57,400
And I could have bought a burger time

2439
02:07:57,400 --> 02:08:00,160
machine that worked for less money than what I ultimately bought.

2440
02:08:00,160 --> 02:08:02,880
You just have to get money with private sellers.

2441
02:08:03,080 --> 02:08:05,640
That's how I got my DDR cabinet.

2442
02:08:05,840 --> 02:08:09,120
You just get you get someone that just doesn't care.

2443
02:08:09,320 --> 02:08:11,480
They just want a certain amount of money for it.

2444
02:08:11,520 --> 02:08:15,520
Like to them, it's just it's just better to get rid of it at that point.

2445
02:08:15,720 --> 02:08:16,760
You can get lucky.

2446
02:08:16,960 --> 02:08:20,640
So anyway, I have some major financial

2447
02:08:20,640 --> 02:08:23,840
things that I haven't gotten into detail on the show yet.

2448
02:08:23,840 --> 02:08:25,240
I will eventually, I promise.

2449
02:08:25,440 --> 02:08:29,200
But there's just some stuff I have to save up for and make happen.

2450
02:08:29,400 --> 02:08:33,560
And so seven hundred bucks out of that just I don't I just don't realistically

2451
02:08:33,560 --> 02:08:34,960
think it's going to happen, unfortunately.

2452
02:08:35,160 --> 02:08:36,760
If it's meant to happen, it'll happen.

2453
02:08:36,960 --> 02:08:39,200
If, say, February, those machines are still

2454
02:08:39,240 --> 02:08:42,640
available and I still have the money, then, yes, I'll pick one up.

2455
02:08:42,840 --> 02:08:47,200
But if they're gone, it's sold out, then I guess it wasn't meant to happen.

2456
02:08:47,400 --> 02:08:49,920
And I'll just hope that there's a reissue,

2457
02:08:49,920 --> 02:08:53,240
like they've reissued some of those Namco machines 20 times over.

2458
02:08:53,240 --> 02:08:55,880
I'm just going to have to cross my fingers and toes for that.

2459
02:08:56,080 --> 02:09:00,760
After all, a lot of games ran on that Tron hardware that that hardware was

2460
02:09:00,960 --> 02:09:05,640
the Bally Midway stuff that ran a journey.

2461
02:09:05,800 --> 02:09:09,680
So that's what I'll hold out hope for is a Tron slash journey cabinet.

2462
02:09:09,880 --> 02:09:15,480
Yes, the old band that ended up having a arcade game in the those.

2463
02:09:15,680 --> 02:09:17,880
There's a lot of games on that hardware.

2464
02:09:18,080 --> 02:09:19,880
Check out those Midway arcade treasures.

2465
02:09:20,000 --> 02:09:22,160
Tron was never in there because of the Disney thing,

2466
02:09:22,360 --> 02:09:26,840
but a lot of games ran on that hardware.

2467
02:09:27,360 --> 02:09:30,440
Bobby's pointing out the TV and the joystick.

2468
02:09:30,640 --> 02:09:34,560
Tron used a very unique, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2469
02:09:34,720 --> 02:09:36,960
So the replica will be very nice to have, I think.

2470
02:09:36,960 --> 02:09:39,040
I think it would just be nice to have like a newer one.

2471
02:09:39,240 --> 02:09:41,000
So. All right.

2472
02:09:41,200 --> 02:09:44,120
Yeah, dark to see a points out there's problems with the journey cabinet

2473
02:09:44,320 --> 02:09:47,720
because journey's changed their lead singer a couple of times now.

2474
02:09:47,920 --> 02:09:50,440
So it would get complicated.

2475
02:09:50,640 --> 02:09:54,000
Do they still have the guy with the pretty hair?

2476
02:09:54,520 --> 02:09:56,640
I think his name is Arnelle or Artell.

2477
02:09:56,640 --> 02:09:57,560
I'm sorry, I forgot his name.

2478
02:09:57,760 --> 02:10:00,560
But yes, he's he's still the guy that's been like him.

2479
02:10:00,760 --> 02:10:03,520
He's been there for almost 10 years now.

2480
02:10:03,720 --> 02:10:06,880
We we saw him when he was new.

2481
02:10:07,080 --> 02:10:08,960
Yeah, no, I know, I know when we went to see Journey.

2482
02:10:09,080 --> 02:10:11,000
Yeah, was that the one where Heart opened?

2483
02:10:11,000 --> 02:10:15,000
And the reason why I'll never go back to that cheap trick, cheap trick opened.

2484
02:10:15,200 --> 02:10:19,280
And then Heart, we missed cheap trick because of the parking, remember?

2485
02:10:19,480 --> 02:10:21,560
But we could hear Heart from the parking lot here.

2486
02:10:21,560 --> 02:10:24,040
Heart, that pissed me off so much. I'll never go back to that venue.

2487
02:10:24,240 --> 02:10:24,760
All right. Yeah.

2488
02:10:24,960 --> 02:10:27,880
But I think I was like singing with everything that Heart did.

2489
02:10:28,080 --> 02:10:29,320
Of course, of course.

2490
02:10:29,520 --> 02:10:31,080
Thank you. VX chase next to me.

2491
02:10:31,120 --> 02:10:33,360
Arnell Pineda, that's his name.

2492
02:10:33,560 --> 02:10:36,120
Yes, he's he's still the guy that he's great.

2493
02:10:36,320 --> 02:10:39,360
And he sounds just like Steve Perry.

2494
02:10:39,560 --> 02:10:41,240
Yeah. Yeah.

2495
02:10:41,440 --> 02:10:45,560
All right, moving on, Dark Sakura.

2496
02:10:45,760 --> 02:10:50,880
So this is something that actually I think I think is very important to me in

2497
02:10:51,080 --> 02:10:59,200
particular, but there is a a group called AbleGamers that have put

2498
02:10:59,200 --> 02:11:04,680
out some criticized different companies for their lack of accessibility options.

2499
02:11:04,880 --> 02:11:06,560
And so

2500
02:11:07,160 --> 02:11:08,720
now

2501
02:11:08,920 --> 02:11:13,680
there is an attempt to try to help disabled gamers find games that they can play.

2502
02:11:13,880 --> 02:11:16,320
There's a nonprofit organization called

2503
02:11:16,520 --> 02:11:20,680
Dagger System that created the Accessible Games Database.

2504
02:11:20,880 --> 02:11:26,640
So in a nutshell, it includes right now 144 games with their accessibility

2505
02:11:26,640 --> 02:11:31,840
options, including Last of Us Part Two, Control, Cyberpunk 2077, Tetris 99.

2506
02:11:32,040 --> 02:11:37,520
People can search by publisher, genre and platform and you can filter for auditory

2507
02:11:37,720 --> 02:11:39,720
visual and motor features.

2508
02:11:39,920 --> 02:11:42,920
So it has like other different subcategories.

2509
02:11:43,120 --> 02:11:45,200
But I think it's really neat.

2510
02:11:45,200 --> 02:11:46,240
The filters aren't final.

2511
02:11:46,440 --> 02:11:52,320
It's still a little bit in development, but I think it will be really useful to

2512
02:11:52,320 --> 02:11:56,520
have something like this for gamers who have limitations in playing.

2513
02:11:56,720 --> 02:11:58,800
This is great. This is one of those things where I'm kind

2514
02:11:58,800 --> 02:12:02,440
of surprised it didn't exist already and maybe it kind of did in like Google

2515
02:12:02,440 --> 02:12:05,000
documents that were circulating around and things like that.

2516
02:12:05,000 --> 02:12:07,800
But I think it's nice that we have like a very comprehensive site.

2517
02:12:08,000 --> 02:12:10,360
Jaskren in our chat says AbleGamers.

2518
02:12:10,560 --> 02:12:12,760
Hell yeah, I give you I wholeheartedly agree.

2519
02:12:12,760 --> 02:12:13,920
Hell yeah.

2520
02:12:14,120 --> 02:12:16,720
I think that's still the charity I have set on my Amazon right now.

2521
02:12:16,920 --> 02:12:19,120
So, you know,

2522
02:12:19,280 --> 02:12:22,920
I'm glad to see they're involved with such awesome projects still.

2523
02:12:22,920 --> 02:12:24,800
I mean, I know they show up a lot of conventions.

2524
02:12:25,000 --> 02:12:27,800
They do a lot of consulting and things of that nature.

2525
02:12:28,000 --> 02:12:29,880
So good on them.

2526
02:12:30,080 --> 02:12:32,520
Pat's on the back. Job well done.

2527
02:12:32,720 --> 02:12:34,680
You're doing good, son.

2528
02:12:34,880 --> 02:12:37,840
The Bamani Boomer says you're doing good, son.

2529
02:12:38,040 --> 02:12:41,040
You're making me proud. All right.

2530
02:12:41,240 --> 02:12:43,040
Jeez. All right.

2531
02:12:43,240 --> 02:12:45,840
Then let's move on, Loki.

2532
02:12:46,040 --> 02:12:47,120
Yep.

2533
02:12:47,320 --> 02:12:49,880
So this is kind of exciting and we kind

2534
02:12:49,880 --> 02:12:52,760
of figured this would happen with any new game that comes out,

2535
02:12:52,960 --> 02:12:58,800
but people have been data mining Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl and found files

2536
02:12:59,000 --> 02:13:04,280
they're hinting at the new future characters that may be coming in DLC.

2537
02:13:04,480 --> 02:13:07,000
So some of the things that I thought were

2538
02:13:07,200 --> 02:13:13,360
kind of funny is they had a character, there's a bunch of files for cheese.

2539
02:13:13,560 --> 02:13:19,040
And of course, that has to do with Shredder, which I thought was pretty funny.

2540
02:13:19,240 --> 02:13:22,680
Some other stuff, you know, we had references to Mr.

2541
02:13:22,880 --> 02:13:29,120
Krabs, Squidward, Plankton, Tommy Pickles, Jimmy Neutron and Rocko

2542
02:13:29,320 --> 02:13:34,840
from Rocko's Modern Life also listed in there.

2543
02:13:35,040 --> 02:13:37,520
They said that, you know,

2544
02:13:37,720 --> 02:13:41,600
the actual community manager for the game, Thaddeus Cruz,

2545
02:13:41,800 --> 02:13:46,280
said that some of the leaks, you know, or some of the concerns that they had

2546
02:13:46,480 --> 02:13:52,400
with these types of leaks is that it doesn't necessarily mean that the content

2547
02:13:52,600 --> 02:13:54,880
was removed. It could have been stuff that they were

2548
02:13:55,080 --> 02:13:58,600
considering, just didn't end up putting in the game.

2549
02:13:58,800 --> 02:14:00,400
You know, they said it wasn't removed.

2550
02:14:00,600 --> 02:14:04,240
This is voice lines in the project, a covered voice lines in the project,

2551
02:14:04,440 --> 02:14:09,760
cover bases and are not to be the end or be all end all confirmations of what can

2552
02:14:09,800 --> 02:14:12,080
and cannot happen.

2553
02:14:12,280 --> 02:14:13,880
So.

2554
02:14:14,320 --> 02:14:17,160
Yeah, I'm curious to see what DLC they're going to have for this game.

2555
02:14:17,160 --> 02:14:19,240
I think it's gonna be pretty cool.

2556
02:14:20,320 --> 02:14:24,040
Yeah, I'm going to admit, even though I shaded the game a little bit earlier

2557
02:14:24,240 --> 02:14:25,840
earlier in the show, I've just seen it.

2558
02:14:26,040 --> 02:14:30,360
Oh, and when I missed here, they also had a reference to a Garfield stage.

2559
02:14:30,560 --> 02:14:32,040
Oh, God.

2560
02:14:32,240 --> 02:14:34,280
Has it made a lasagna?

2561
02:14:34,480 --> 02:14:37,320
So I honestly haven't played the game.

2562
02:14:37,320 --> 02:14:39,440
I've just been hearing things about the game.

2563
02:14:39,480 --> 02:14:42,320
And I did watch one of a streamer.

2564
02:14:42,320 --> 02:14:45,160
You like to Dark Soccer Lapin, the guy up in Vancouver.

2565
02:14:45,160 --> 02:14:47,040
He was playing this Nickelodeon game.

2566
02:14:47,040 --> 02:14:49,760
And I was kind of looking at it, but I was kind of looking at it.

2567
02:14:49,960 --> 02:14:52,040
Yeah, it was late one night.

2568
02:14:52,240 --> 02:14:55,840
But anyway, I did when I was watching him play it.

2569
02:14:56,040 --> 02:15:00,440
I was kind of like, this does feel a little bit like just in the setup

2570
02:15:00,440 --> 02:15:01,440
and the menus and everything.

2571
02:15:01,640 --> 02:15:04,760
This is very like bare bones, like knock off Smash Brothers.

2572
02:15:04,880 --> 02:15:06,360
But then when they got into the fight

2573
02:15:06,360 --> 02:15:09,040
and everything, it looked like it was cute, but it did look I've heard it's

2574
02:15:09,040 --> 02:15:14,520
a little bit sluggish and doesn't it feels like it is a copy of Smash

2575
02:15:14,720 --> 02:15:17,080
Brothers and not the real thing, if that makes sense.

2576
02:15:17,280 --> 02:15:18,720
So, yeah.

2577
02:15:18,920 --> 02:15:20,680
But you know what?

2578
02:15:20,680 --> 02:15:23,600
I think the reason why people are still enjoying it and I think it will show up

2579
02:15:23,600 --> 02:15:26,760
in competitive events and I think they'll probably continue to improve it.

2580
02:15:26,960 --> 02:15:32,200
The roster is strong and a lot of what you just kind of added to that, even me.

2581
02:15:32,400 --> 02:15:36,360
Boomer can go in and look and I'm like, oh,

2582
02:15:36,400 --> 02:15:40,720
I recognize I recognize Ren Stimpy, Invader Zim, powdered toast, man.

2583
02:15:40,720 --> 02:15:41,680
Like there was a lot of characters.

2584
02:15:41,680 --> 02:15:44,040
I was like, OK, even my old ass knows these characters.

2585
02:15:44,240 --> 02:15:47,680
So there were some I didn't know, but there were quite a few.

2586
02:15:47,680 --> 02:15:49,080
I did. I was like, oh, April O'Neill.

2587
02:15:49,080 --> 02:15:51,000
I know her, you know, and that whole thing.

2588
02:15:51,000 --> 02:15:52,800
So 80s Ninja Turtles, too.

2589
02:15:53,000 --> 02:15:53,840
So, yeah, yeah.

2590
02:15:54,040 --> 02:15:56,080
It's what's the one people remember, Loki?

2591
02:15:56,280 --> 02:15:57,360
That's the thing.

2592
02:15:57,560 --> 02:15:59,960
If April O'Neill isn't wearing that bright

2593
02:16:00,160 --> 02:16:02,840
yellow pantsuit, then is it really April O'Neill?

2594
02:16:03,040 --> 02:16:05,400
It's not. It's not.

2595
02:16:05,600 --> 02:16:08,680
My favorite April O'Neill

2596
02:16:08,880 --> 02:16:12,280
is the one on the side of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles arcade cabinet.

2597
02:16:12,480 --> 02:16:16,280
Take a really good look at that fake ass fucking wig she's wearing.

2598
02:16:16,480 --> 02:16:21,040
Next time you next time you walk by a 90s Ninja Turtle arcade cabinet,

2599
02:16:21,240 --> 02:16:25,840
take a real good look at April O'Neill on there that she walked right out

2600
02:16:26,040 --> 02:16:29,400
of Party City's clearance aisle, OK?

2601
02:16:29,600 --> 02:16:32,960
And what a queen, Lord, what a queen.

2602
02:16:33,120 --> 02:16:35,520
All right. And and oh, my God.

2603
02:16:35,720 --> 02:16:41,840
Well, she kind of resembles the the movie April O'Neill, sort of.

2604
02:16:42,040 --> 02:16:43,920
Yeah, no, she she does.

2605
02:16:44,120 --> 02:16:46,680
But yeah, that that is not her hair.

2606
02:16:46,880 --> 02:16:50,000
DJ Romas says it may be a fake wig, but the model is hella cute.

2607
02:16:50,200 --> 02:16:52,200
I'm not shading her whatsoever.

2608
02:16:52,400 --> 02:16:53,800
She's iconic.

2609
02:16:54,000 --> 02:16:55,840
OK, that is actually a compliment.

2610
02:16:56,040 --> 02:16:58,040
But let's not kid ourselves.

2611
02:16:58,080 --> 02:17:03,080
She's iconic because she's wearing a ninety nine cent piece of vinyl very well.

2612
02:17:03,280 --> 02:17:07,480
OK, it's like and I don't mean that in a like weird stalker way.

2613
02:17:07,480 --> 02:17:09,200
I just mean she's a queen. All right.

2614
02:17:09,400 --> 02:17:11,120
Yeah. Moving on.

2615
02:17:11,320 --> 02:17:12,440
She wears it well.

2616
02:17:12,640 --> 02:17:14,280
Yes, she wears it well.

2617
02:17:14,480 --> 02:17:16,840
Boop, boop, boop. OK,

2618
02:17:17,040 --> 02:17:17,920
moving on.

2619
02:17:18,120 --> 02:17:21,440
Are people are are multiple people linking that in chat?

2620
02:17:21,640 --> 02:17:23,640
That must be what it is now.

2621
02:17:23,840 --> 02:17:26,160
I appreciate you chatters.

2622
02:17:26,360 --> 02:17:27,200
Moving on.

2623
02:17:27,360 --> 02:17:30,000
There was an update to World of Warcraft.

2624
02:17:30,200 --> 02:17:31,520
They've been kind of going back through

2625
02:17:31,720 --> 02:17:36,160
that game with a fine tooth comb and clearing out some of the oofs things.

2626
02:17:36,160 --> 02:17:39,160
You know, World of Warcraft is an old ass game at this point, right?

2627
02:17:39,160 --> 02:17:41,480
It's a it's like 15 years old at this point, right?

2628
02:17:41,680 --> 02:17:44,280
Yeah, you've done an expansion as the classic game of the week.

2629
02:17:44,480 --> 02:17:47,040
The game itself is over 15 years at this point.

2630
02:17:47,240 --> 02:17:48,560
So.

2631
02:17:48,760 --> 02:17:52,320
There are some things in there that don't read very well this day and age,

2632
02:17:52,320 --> 02:17:55,000
especially with the lens that Blizzard is under right now.

2633
02:17:55,200 --> 02:17:58,600
So there were some things that were removed.

2634
02:17:58,800 --> 02:18:03,600
So sometimes some characters that had a lot of dialog before.

2635
02:18:04,680 --> 02:18:06,760
Do not have as much dialog now.

2636
02:18:06,960 --> 02:18:09,200
Oh, this is the stuff you remember.

2637
02:18:09,400 --> 02:18:13,000
OK, you remember when you would click them and they would say things.

2638
02:18:13,200 --> 02:18:17,440
So like the Torrin male used to say, homogenized.

2639
02:18:17,640 --> 02:18:20,000
No way. I like the ladies.

2640
02:18:20,200 --> 02:18:23,080
Now, look, I'm gay.

2641
02:18:23,280 --> 02:18:26,720
I, I look at that and I just go.

2642
02:18:26,920 --> 02:18:28,520
I'm not offended by that joke.

2643
02:18:28,720 --> 02:18:31,480
I just think it's stupid, but OK, it is kind of stupid.

2644
02:18:31,480 --> 02:18:32,960
Yeah, that's why it's stupid.

2645
02:18:33,160 --> 02:18:36,760
But there's a lot of stupid stuff in video games, whatever.

2646
02:18:36,960 --> 02:18:43,480
But I also understand why now in the year 2021 with everything,

2647
02:18:43,480 --> 02:18:46,040
you know, that we're looking at, especially it's going on Blizzard.

2648
02:18:46,040 --> 02:18:47,600
I understand why they made an editorial

2649
02:18:47,800 --> 02:18:51,360
choice to say, you know what, I'm going to get that joke on out of there.

2650
02:18:51,520 --> 02:18:52,840
I don't know.

2651
02:18:53,040 --> 02:18:55,640
Maybe they should have taken the time to get a new line.

2652
02:18:55,840 --> 02:18:57,000
But maybe some of these same voice

2653
02:18:57,000 --> 02:18:59,160
actors aren't available or anything like that anymore.

2654
02:18:59,360 --> 02:19:02,960
I'm not I'm not sure anyway.

2655
02:19:03,160 --> 02:19:04,320
There's some other ones that are.

2656
02:19:04,520 --> 02:19:07,360
Yeah, like the orc female says, what's estrogen?

2657
02:19:07,360 --> 02:19:09,760
Can you eat it? That is no longer there either.

2658
02:19:09,960 --> 02:19:12,360
That one's a bit of a yike, a little bit.

2659
02:19:12,560 --> 02:19:16,920
The blood elf demon hunter used to say, are you sure you're not part demon?

2660
02:19:17,120 --> 02:19:19,160
I find myself wanting to stalk you.

2661
02:19:19,360 --> 02:19:20,280
That's an oof.

2662
02:19:20,480 --> 02:19:23,400
So there's there you definitely look at a lot of these things they removed.

2663
02:19:23,600 --> 02:19:26,240
And you go the mount writing the mount.

2664
02:19:26,440 --> 02:19:27,640
Yeah, yeah.

2665
02:19:27,640 --> 02:19:31,960
So there's a lot of these things that you look at and you go, oof, didn't age well.

2666
02:19:32,160 --> 02:19:33,720
So there it goes.

2667
02:19:33,920 --> 02:19:35,560
Now, of course, some of your,

2668
02:19:35,760 --> 02:19:39,240
you know, people that didn't even probably realize these jokes were there,

2669
02:19:39,440 --> 02:19:43,800
of course, are getting outraged over it because, you know, my my my censorship,

2670
02:19:43,800 --> 02:19:45,120
my video, you know what?

2671
02:19:45,320 --> 02:19:47,840
There's been a lot that's changed in World of Warcraft over the years.

2672
02:19:47,840 --> 02:19:48,880
In fact, so much has changed.

2673
02:19:48,880 --> 02:19:49,760
I don't play it anymore.

2674
02:19:49,840 --> 02:19:51,520
But it has nothing to do with the dialog.

2675
02:19:51,720 --> 02:19:54,840
It has to do with the other choices made in the game as to how it plays.

2676
02:19:55,040 --> 02:19:56,640
So

2677
02:19:56,840 --> 02:19:59,320
I appreciate that they are modernizing

2678
02:19:59,520 --> 02:20:03,600
the dialog like they are attempting to modernize everything else.

2679
02:20:03,800 --> 02:20:06,440
Speaking of choices,

2680
02:20:06,640 --> 02:20:12,120
let's also talk about a related story, also known as that time that Nintendo was

2681
02:20:12,320 --> 02:20:18,680
horny, specifically Nintendo of France, they decided to tweet an image

2682
02:20:18,880 --> 02:20:25,320
this last weekend of Metal Gear Solid Snake looking at Samus in the Zero

2683
02:20:25,520 --> 02:20:29,680
Mission suit, it's very clearly a screenshot that was taken in

2684
02:20:29,880 --> 02:20:31,040
Super Smash.

2685
02:20:31,240 --> 02:20:32,920
But the way it looks like it looks like

2686
02:20:33,120 --> 02:20:38,200
Metal Solid Snake is just straight up staring at Samus's ass.

2687
02:20:38,400 --> 02:20:40,360
And then they deleted the tweet.

2688
02:20:40,560 --> 02:20:43,240
I think they tweeted it with the eyes emoji.

2689
02:20:43,440 --> 02:20:46,320
I want to say what did they tweet it with?

2690
02:20:46,520 --> 02:20:47,160
Where was it?

2691
02:20:47,160 --> 02:20:48,680
I'm trying to look at the original tweet here.

2692
02:20:48,680 --> 02:20:50,680
My screen must be too. Yeah, that's what it was.

2693
02:20:50,680 --> 02:20:51,720
Just the eyes emoji.

2694
02:20:51,920 --> 02:20:53,120
That's all they tweeted.

2695
02:20:53,320 --> 02:20:55,600
You know, so that's what I do.

2696
02:20:55,800 --> 02:20:59,120
I you know, people are horny on Twitter all the time, right?

2697
02:20:59,320 --> 02:21:03,200
People, people, Loki, I know you've been Twitter is a thirsty spot.

2698
02:21:03,400 --> 02:21:05,520
I know you've been a victim of being

2699
02:21:05,720 --> 02:21:08,240
attacked by horny Twitter when you weren't ready for it.

2700
02:21:08,240 --> 02:21:09,560
Right.

2701
02:21:10,400 --> 02:21:12,200
So sometimes these tweets will get in your

2702
02:21:12,400 --> 02:21:15,360
timeline, it's up somebody's horny on main.

2703
02:21:15,520 --> 02:21:20,320
Once in a while, I might indulge or respond, so I'm sorry, but I will usually

2704
02:21:20,520 --> 02:21:26,000
respond with said eyes emoji, it's the perfect response to those sorts of tweets.

2705
02:21:26,200 --> 02:21:27,800
That's it.

2706
02:21:28,920 --> 02:21:30,560
But anyway.

2707
02:21:30,760 --> 02:21:32,400
We just need a trombone icon.

2708
02:21:32,600 --> 02:21:36,400
It was deleted, it was it was nuked into orbit.

2709
02:21:36,600 --> 02:21:38,080
I'm assuming

2710
02:21:38,280 --> 02:21:40,840
at the rest of Nintendo outside of France,

2711
02:21:41,040 --> 02:21:43,440
they probably had a hard time seeing the humor in that.

2712
02:21:43,640 --> 02:21:44,960
Anyway.

2713
02:21:45,560 --> 02:21:48,080
Let's see, DJ says it's always an intern,

2714
02:21:48,080 --> 02:21:50,640
probably that monkey says probably was an intern, probably.

2715
02:21:50,840 --> 02:21:53,480
I don't know if it was necessarily an intern, but it was just probably somebody

2716
02:21:53,680 --> 02:21:57,800
on social media that was like, this will go viral and didn't stop to think about.

2717
02:21:58,000 --> 02:22:00,360
Is that good, though?

2718
02:22:00,560 --> 02:22:01,600
Oof.

2719
02:22:01,800 --> 02:22:03,520
Should it go viral?

2720
02:22:03,720 --> 02:22:04,960
Should it go viral?

2721
02:22:05,160 --> 02:22:06,400
Excellent question.

2722
02:22:06,600 --> 02:22:07,080
All right.

2723
02:22:07,080 --> 02:22:08,920
I think we're up to the part of the show

2724
02:22:08,920 --> 02:22:11,960
that is the listener roundtable where we're going to invite your calls and so

2725
02:22:12,000 --> 02:22:15,120
forth, you can call in via our Discord server,

2726
02:22:15,320 --> 02:22:17,400
vognetwork.com Discord.

2727
02:22:17,600 --> 02:22:20,400
You guys, we already have a caller in Discord ready to go.

2728
02:22:20,400 --> 02:22:21,560
So what do you say we get to it?

2729
02:22:21,560 --> 02:22:22,960
Let's invite somebody else on the show here.

2730
02:22:22,960 --> 02:22:24,400
Sound good? Sure.

2731
02:22:24,440 --> 02:22:25,280
All right, let's do it.

2732
02:22:25,480 --> 02:22:28,080
And we're going to bring them in and say hello.

2733
02:22:28,080 --> 02:22:29,560
And hi, you're on Orange Lawns Radio.

2734
02:22:29,760 --> 02:22:30,680
Who's this?

2735
02:22:30,880 --> 02:22:35,000
It is he who requires more than 20 seconds to talk about things tonight.

2736
02:22:35,000 --> 02:22:36,600
Hey, Jason, how you doing, sir?

2737
02:22:36,600 --> 02:22:38,040
I'm trying to find the right screenshot there.

2738
02:22:38,040 --> 02:22:39,440
There we go. Hi, Jason.

2739
02:22:39,440 --> 02:22:40,440
How are you?

2740
02:22:40,600 --> 02:22:43,440
I am doing OK.

2741
02:22:43,640 --> 02:22:44,560
OK. All right.

2742
02:22:44,560 --> 02:22:47,200
Well, OK is better than crappy, so we'll take it.

2743
02:22:47,400 --> 02:22:49,840
Yeah, I hope things get even better for you tomorrow.

2744
02:22:50,040 --> 02:22:51,160
Exactly.

2745
02:22:51,360 --> 02:22:54,440
Well, it is a Monday, so there's no guarantees about that.

2746
02:22:54,640 --> 02:22:56,360
We'll do our best.

2747
02:22:56,560 --> 02:22:58,680
I want to talk about Facebook.

2748
02:22:58,880 --> 02:23:01,240
Actually, I don't want to, but I'm going to.

2749
02:23:01,440 --> 02:23:02,840
OK, can we not?

2750
02:23:03,040 --> 02:23:05,640
But OK, under that context, sure, go ahead.

2751
02:23:05,840 --> 02:23:09,320
Yeah, the whole social network thing,

2752
02:23:09,320 --> 02:23:11,440
the whole social network subject is really difficult.

2753
02:23:11,640 --> 02:23:15,160
And before I say anything else, I think the important thing for me to say

2754
02:23:15,360 --> 02:23:20,760
outright is I agree with all of the points that all of you make.

2755
02:23:20,960 --> 02:23:23,480
Like I am in favor of Facebook being broken up.

2756
02:23:23,680 --> 02:23:27,840
I am in favor of Facebook being less of the less of the, you know,

2757
02:23:28,040 --> 02:23:31,080
the the predominant town square than it is.

2758
02:23:31,280 --> 02:23:35,680
There's just kind of a there's kind of a way that Facebook is talked about.

2759
02:23:35,880 --> 02:23:38,400
I think it's something that's not ever

2760
02:23:38,480 --> 02:23:44,000
going to change, like some some business always has the ire of everyone.

2761
02:23:44,000 --> 02:23:47,120
It's the you know, it's the it's the it's the Goliath problem.

2762
02:23:47,120 --> 02:23:48,720
There's always going to be someone there.

2763
02:23:48,920 --> 02:23:55,400
And the arguments, the way that people talk about Facebook as if they are the

2764
02:23:55,600 --> 02:24:00,800
God, I can't I can't find the right word because catalyst is probably correct.

2765
02:24:01,000 --> 02:24:06,800
Instigator is possibly correct in this context, like like

2766
02:24:07,000 --> 02:24:10,640
there is always a social demon because the problem is not the service.

2767
02:24:10,840 --> 02:24:11,920
The problem is not the medium.

2768
02:24:12,120 --> 02:24:14,600
The problem is the people

2769
02:24:14,800 --> 02:24:18,040
to a majority extent, like it's not Facebook, Facebook.

2770
02:24:18,240 --> 02:24:23,920
Facebook did not get the the the the flat earthers together,

2771
02:24:24,120 --> 02:24:27,840
but it does provide a place for conversation for them and outreach

2772
02:24:28,040 --> 02:24:30,800
and marketing and viral blah, blah, blah.

2773
02:24:31,000 --> 02:24:32,960
They made it really easy.

2774
02:24:33,160 --> 02:24:36,440
Yeah, and that's not that's not necessarily a bad thing.

2775
02:24:36,480 --> 02:24:42,080
However, the one thing that is applicable that is problematic with Facebook is

2776
02:24:42,280 --> 02:24:45,960
basically everything they can't that came out of 60 Minutes is is

2777
02:24:46,160 --> 02:24:50,360
as far as I'm aware, is a complete outsider, completely true.

2778
02:24:50,560 --> 02:24:52,840
And this isn't even the first time we've heard these kinds of things.

2779
02:24:53,040 --> 02:24:54,840
So a quick summary.

2780
02:24:55,040 --> 02:24:58,200
60 Minutes was the whistleblower

2781
02:24:58,400 --> 02:25:02,000
whose name that the lady's name I've already forgotten because it's foreign

2782
02:25:02,000 --> 02:25:03,680
and just doesn't fit in my brain very well.

2783
02:25:03,920 --> 02:25:08,040
It's fine for foreign foreign sounding, of course.

2784
02:25:08,240 --> 02:25:11,040
She talked about how the civil ethics

2785
02:25:11,240 --> 02:25:17,480
and civil research group within Facebook came to the conclusion that Instagram

2786
02:25:17,680 --> 02:25:22,960
Instagram in particular was bad for especially teenage girls,

2787
02:25:23,160 --> 02:25:26,240
self-image, self-confidence, self-worth, et cetera.

2788
02:25:26,440 --> 02:25:31,080
I remember an article four or five years ago or somewhere

2789
02:25:31,120 --> 02:25:35,600
around there that talked about a group within Facebook

2790
02:25:36,360 --> 02:25:38,440
knowingly.

2791
02:25:38,640 --> 02:25:42,640
Enacted a social experiment.

2792
02:25:42,840 --> 02:25:45,320
On users

2793
02:25:45,520 --> 02:25:49,840
with no consultation, they be, you know, in the in the era of the algorithm,

2794
02:25:50,040 --> 02:25:57,440
they knowingly put they knowingly featured negative toned sounding posts

2795
02:25:57,600 --> 02:26:00,320
into the preference of the individual's feed

2796
02:26:00,520 --> 02:26:03,760
to see if it influenced the things that they then posted.

2797
02:26:03,960 --> 02:26:09,000
So I I've I've you know, I was not a Facebook fan.

2798
02:26:09,200 --> 02:26:12,120
I had my grievances for Facebook from the outset.

2799
02:26:12,320 --> 02:26:17,000
I, like most other people, use it because as the predominant social network,

2800
02:26:17,200 --> 02:26:23,160
I exactly as like Jamie said, I used it to keep in touch with people

2801
02:26:23,360 --> 02:26:26,760
that a couple of years ago, I think it was I think it was twenty eighteen

2802
02:26:26,760 --> 02:26:29,200
that I nuked all my social networking because like

2803
02:26:29,400 --> 02:26:33,240
the amount that it was worth anything was not worth it.

2804
02:26:33,440 --> 02:26:36,200
So I stepped out of Facebook entirely.

2805
02:26:36,400 --> 02:26:37,760
I even stepped out of.

2806
02:26:37,960 --> 02:26:39,880
I know you've got still got points to make, but I just want to say because

2807
02:26:39,880 --> 02:26:43,000
something I had a click aha moment when you're talking about the body image

2808
02:26:43,000 --> 02:26:45,960
things and some of the things that this targeted, you know, it's interesting.

2809
02:26:45,960 --> 02:26:48,440
I mean, I know he said it very tongue in cheek early in the show,

2810
02:26:48,440 --> 02:26:51,480
but when Loki was talking about why does he always see all these underwear ads

2811
02:26:51,680 --> 02:26:56,240
on Facebook, I mean, in a way, if you think about it, a lot of those ads

2812
02:26:56,440 --> 02:27:00,240
can I mean, we don't talk about male body positivity and all this stuff enough

2813
02:27:00,440 --> 02:27:03,720
in our society, but there definitely is something about you look at a lot

2814
02:27:03,720 --> 02:27:06,880
of those models and it's like, I'm never going to look like that.

2815
02:27:07,080 --> 02:27:10,280
So, you know, in a weird in a weird way,

2816
02:27:10,480 --> 02:27:15,920
even you and I, Loki, Dark Soccer, all of us as adults get

2817
02:27:16,120 --> 02:27:18,960
faced with a lot of that body positive images.

2818
02:27:18,960 --> 02:27:20,000
Oh, yeah. All of that.

2819
02:27:20,000 --> 02:27:23,480
They also like advertising a ton of shirts that are supposed to make you look

2820
02:27:23,480 --> 02:27:26,120
more slimmer and pants that make you look slimmer.

2821
02:27:26,320 --> 02:27:28,120
It's like, who do you call me fat?

2822
02:27:28,120 --> 02:27:29,600
There was a Facebook.

2823
02:27:29,600 --> 02:27:31,480
Jason, it was just an interesting aha moment.

2824
02:27:31,480 --> 02:27:34,440
I wanted to call out there that it's even though, yes,

2825
02:27:34,920 --> 02:27:38,280
when we talk about kids, we get even angrier because kids are innocent

2826
02:27:38,280 --> 02:27:38,840
and so forth.

2827
02:27:38,840 --> 02:27:41,680
But it is very interesting when you really stop and think about it.

2828
02:27:41,680 --> 02:27:43,880
Everybody's being targeted with that stuff. Everybody.

2829
02:27:43,880 --> 02:27:46,360
Yeah, because because the problem is social.

2830
02:27:46,360 --> 02:27:49,720
So there's this thing there's this thing that I've been saying at work

2831
02:27:49,720 --> 02:27:53,320
as I'm as I've developed a lot more of my a lot more of my kind of like

2832
02:27:53,320 --> 02:27:54,800
mentored leaning and whatnot.

2833
02:27:56,600 --> 02:28:01,960
Social technology does not fix social problems.

2834
02:28:02,680 --> 02:28:06,600
And when when I think about a lot of the prescriptive ways

2835
02:28:06,600 --> 02:28:10,000
that things can be done to of things that could be done to Facebook,

2836
02:28:10,000 --> 02:28:14,040
Allah breaking them up like at a high level, that's really important.

2837
02:28:14,040 --> 02:28:18,320
But like, how do you how do you prescribe functional

2838
02:28:18,320 --> 02:28:24,400
social behavior, both on the the enabler, the, you know, public space,

2839
02:28:24,400 --> 02:28:31,440
little p public space versus like put the put the details on the people?

2840
02:28:32,840 --> 02:28:35,520
It's the same problem with freedom of speech and so many other things

2841
02:28:35,520 --> 02:28:38,480
like social, social, social problems are evergreen.

2842
02:28:38,480 --> 02:28:40,680
Social problems are.

2843
02:28:41,200 --> 02:28:45,400
Will social problems will exist forever because they are people.

2844
02:28:45,760 --> 02:28:46,520
They'll be made worse.

2845
02:28:46,520 --> 02:28:47,480
They'll be made better.

2846
02:28:47,520 --> 02:28:49,200
Like, like everything's going to go around.

2847
02:28:49,200 --> 02:28:52,920
But it's just kind of like the, you know, it's the it's the it's it's

2848
02:28:52,920 --> 02:28:56,920
piling on the big dog situation that just kind of just kind of bums me out

2849
02:28:56,920 --> 02:29:01,040
every once in a while to hear from anybody, all of these opinions, you

2850
02:29:01,040 --> 02:29:04,760
know, not not not singling out the show whatsoever, because I late night

2851
02:29:04,760 --> 02:29:08,120
and anybody else that rails about Facebook on Facebook, which is their

2852
02:29:08,120 --> 02:29:12,400
prerogative to do, it's just a really difficult subject because social

2853
02:29:12,400 --> 02:29:17,320
interaction is imperfect and you don't need any any any catalyst for that.

2854
02:29:17,480 --> 02:29:18,080
Sure.

2855
02:29:18,080 --> 02:29:19,080
But the thing.

2856
02:29:19,080 --> 02:29:20,760
OK, so here's here's the thing.

2857
02:29:20,760 --> 02:29:23,840
When it's I'm looking at a comment in chat from Square Tangle that says,

2858
02:29:23,840 --> 02:29:26,520
bring back GeoCities, bring back LiveJournal, bring back Zonga.

2859
02:29:26,520 --> 02:29:28,920
Hell, yeah, because I was such a fan of LiveJournal.

2860
02:29:29,200 --> 02:29:34,200
I I wouldn't say I met Dark Soccer and Loki through LiveJournal or you, Jason.

2861
02:29:34,200 --> 02:29:37,120
But our friendships were all strengthened through LiveJournal.

2862
02:29:37,120 --> 02:29:39,600
We probably actually met on DDR Freak.

2863
02:29:39,600 --> 02:29:40,760
You know, it's still there.

2864
02:29:40,760 --> 02:29:42,000
Just highly Russian.

2865
02:29:42,000 --> 02:29:44,080
I did meet my husband on LiveJournal.

2866
02:29:44,080 --> 02:29:44,960
Those were the days.

2867
02:29:45,000 --> 02:29:50,480
However, LiveJournal wasn't so easy to get on and use, you know, you still

2868
02:29:50,480 --> 02:29:53,840
had to be a little bit of a nerd somewhat to be able to use LiveJournal.

2869
02:29:54,840 --> 02:29:57,280
LiveJournal never really cracked the mainstream like that.

2870
02:29:57,280 --> 02:30:00,400
LiveJournal never really had a functional mobile phone app.

2871
02:30:00,800 --> 02:30:03,960
Yes, I know there was a I said a functional mobile phone app.

2872
02:30:03,960 --> 02:30:05,280
So you all know what I mean.

2873
02:30:05,280 --> 02:30:07,680
Facebook hit that perfect storm.

2874
02:30:07,680 --> 02:30:10,360
And I think we've all been wondering, when's Facebook going to get replaced?

2875
02:30:10,360 --> 02:30:11,600
Because I lived through LiveJournal.

2876
02:30:11,600 --> 02:30:13,320
I lived through Zonga. I lived through Friendster.

2877
02:30:13,320 --> 02:30:15,800
I lived through Myspace, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, all of it.

2878
02:30:16,000 --> 02:30:18,800
But yet we wait for Facebook to go away and it never does because they

2879
02:30:18,800 --> 02:30:22,120
hit that perfect storm of coming out when all the mobile phone

2880
02:30:22,120 --> 02:30:23,440
stuff came out and all of that.

2881
02:30:24,200 --> 02:30:25,440
Here's LiveJournal.

2882
02:30:26,000 --> 02:30:26,280
Go ahead.

2883
02:30:26,760 --> 02:30:29,120
Uh, yeah, Facebook, Facebook hit that, that perfect storm.

2884
02:30:29,960 --> 02:30:33,360
I do agree with you that it's like, you know, yes, Facebook does reflect

2885
02:30:33,400 --> 02:30:37,560
a lot of society's problems, but where Facebook has a real problem

2886
02:30:37,560 --> 02:30:39,240
and Twitter has a real problem.

2887
02:30:39,720 --> 02:30:45,320
There are artificialities being injected into normal people

2888
02:30:45,320 --> 02:30:50,920
conversations that shouldn't be there, but they're artificially being pushed.

2889
02:30:51,080 --> 02:30:54,160
And we know that through the whole, you know, Cambridge Analytica stuff

2890
02:30:54,160 --> 02:30:56,800
that came up a couple of years ago out of Facebook through the advertising.

2891
02:30:57,000 --> 02:30:58,520
And now we know this too.

2892
02:30:58,520 --> 02:31:01,360
We know that Facebook is promoting content with the body

2893
02:31:01,360 --> 02:31:02,560
positivity and all this stuff.

2894
02:31:02,560 --> 02:31:05,640
Facebook thrives on this controversial content.

2895
02:31:06,080 --> 02:31:10,920
Our conversations face to face might get heated, might get animated.

2896
02:31:11,320 --> 02:31:18,520
They don't go to that place of straight up bullshit, unfounded bullshit, usually.

2897
02:31:18,680 --> 02:31:22,040
Now, and now, now when they do, we think, well, yeah, sure.

2898
02:31:22,040 --> 02:31:24,720
I have a lot of conversations with family members that are bullshit because

2899
02:31:24,720 --> 02:31:27,360
they're reading it on Facebook because you don't have to be a

2900
02:31:27,360 --> 02:31:28,920
real person to post on Facebook.

2901
02:31:30,160 --> 02:31:30,520
Nope.

2902
02:31:30,960 --> 02:31:33,800
It's become that easy to use.

2903
02:31:33,840 --> 02:31:35,400
And that's the problem.

2904
02:31:35,680 --> 02:31:40,280
Like I, I, it's, and I know I'm, I know I'm sounding like one of those crazy

2905
02:31:40,280 --> 02:31:42,520
conspiracy, I sound like the art bell show right now.

2906
02:31:42,520 --> 02:31:43,200
That's fine.

2907
02:31:43,200 --> 02:31:44,280
I'll, I'll accept that.

2908
02:31:44,760 --> 02:31:49,400
But the problem is foreign influencers have infiltrated Facebook.

2909
02:31:50,000 --> 02:31:50,800
Period.

2910
02:31:53,080 --> 02:31:55,040
And Facebook is not doing enough about it.

2911
02:31:56,680 --> 02:32:01,320
And they're stirring the pot with all of this stuff because they can.

2912
02:32:02,400 --> 02:32:05,520
I don't, I'm going to, I'm going to go there.

2913
02:32:05,520 --> 02:32:06,400
Whatever I live there.

2914
02:32:09,280 --> 02:32:13,360
You, you have a timeshare, all this vaccination misinformation and all

2915
02:32:13,360 --> 02:32:15,320
this bullshit that's going on on Facebook.

2916
02:32:15,520 --> 02:32:20,640
That is proactively encouraging people to not take the vaccine and die as a result.

2917
02:32:23,200 --> 02:32:26,840
That is the result of foreign influence and people wanting

2918
02:32:26,840 --> 02:32:28,560
to take down America a few pegs.

2919
02:32:29,320 --> 02:32:31,840
I can counterpoint you with that very easily.

2920
02:32:32,200 --> 02:32:32,560
Sure.

2921
02:32:33,160 --> 02:32:35,240
Jenny McCarthy a decade ago.

2922
02:32:36,600 --> 02:32:41,520
But even this isn't new, this isn't new vaccine misinformation and denial.

2923
02:32:41,520 --> 02:32:42,800
This isn't any bit new.

2924
02:32:42,920 --> 02:32:43,720
It's just lethal.

2925
02:32:43,720 --> 02:32:48,320
Now, even, even her was amplified by Facebook though.

2926
02:32:48,360 --> 02:32:52,440
Facebook's been around that long where I also associate a lot of here's the,

2927
02:32:52,480 --> 02:32:54,520
here's the thing, yes, you're right.

2928
02:32:54,520 --> 02:32:57,600
Jenny McCarthy and all that, you know, bullshit.

2929
02:32:57,640 --> 02:32:59,800
And, and that from that years ago.

2930
02:32:59,800 --> 02:33:00,600
Yes, absolutely.

2931
02:33:00,600 --> 02:33:01,280
I'm with you there.

2932
02:33:01,280 --> 02:33:02,240
That did exist.

2933
02:33:02,600 --> 02:33:08,360
But again, Facebook amplified it because, and you know, I bet there were many people

2934
02:33:08,360 --> 02:33:12,120
out there that had no idea who that woman was until Facebook started amplifying the

2935
02:33:12,120 --> 02:33:14,880
message and people started sharing that on the social media.

2936
02:33:15,000 --> 02:33:18,240
And we had those clickbait headlines that brought that stuff up to the forefront.

2937
02:33:18,400 --> 02:33:23,200
And I even want to say, I could be wrong, but I feel like I've seen before Jenny

2938
02:33:23,200 --> 02:33:27,800
McCarthy even saying, you know, I wish I wasn't the poster person for this anymore.

2939
02:33:28,400 --> 02:33:32,680
I, I've, you know, I, I, I, I think I'm getting taken out of context a lot and

2940
02:33:32,680 --> 02:33:33,120
stuff like this.

2941
02:33:33,280 --> 02:33:38,120
She said things like that, but it doesn't matter because the narrative's already been

2942
02:33:38,120 --> 02:33:39,080
written on social media.

2943
02:33:39,280 --> 02:33:42,560
Like, I think, I think that's kind of like where it is for me is that you're right.

2944
02:33:42,600 --> 02:33:47,760
Her perspective and her silly, and in, if I'll give you this too, like the flat earth

2945
02:33:47,760 --> 02:33:51,440
and all that stuff that the concept of flat earth that's been around a long time.

2946
02:33:51,440 --> 02:33:52,360
That doesn't hurt anybody.

2947
02:33:52,400 --> 02:33:55,280
That's, that's also kind of true.

2948
02:33:55,320 --> 02:33:57,760
The flat earth thing is just something we can all laugh at.

2949
02:33:58,440 --> 02:34:02,120
You say you can, you're believing that it's not going to make you like die.

2950
02:34:02,160 --> 02:34:05,840
You say it doesn't hurt anybody, but it killed rocket man.

2951
02:34:05,880 --> 02:34:07,360
So, uh, all right.

2952
02:34:07,400 --> 02:34:07,720
All right.

2953
02:34:07,760 --> 02:34:08,640
There's at least one.

2954
02:34:08,680 --> 02:34:09,000
All right.

2955
02:34:09,040 --> 02:34:09,360
I'll know.

2956
02:34:09,400 --> 02:34:09,920
I'll give you that.

2957
02:34:09,920 --> 02:34:10,240
I'll get it.

2958
02:34:10,440 --> 02:34:15,120
And I'm not suddenly saying like, but, but again, the Facebook and those types of

2959
02:34:15,120 --> 02:34:18,000
platforms have made it easier for those people to find each other because it's so

2960
02:34:18,000 --> 02:34:18,960
easy to get on Facebook.

2961
02:34:18,960 --> 02:34:22,160
In fact, Facebook actively recruits you at a young age.

2962
02:34:22,840 --> 02:34:22,960
Yeah.

2963
02:34:22,960 --> 02:34:24,680
It's not so easy to build a rocket ship.

2964
02:34:24,680 --> 02:34:28,800
So, you know, yeah, I am going to say that there is no forces

2965
02:34:28,800 --> 02:34:30,560
dangerous on earth as belief.

2966
02:34:32,520 --> 02:34:32,920
Anyway.

2967
02:34:32,920 --> 02:34:35,600
So, Jason, Jason, I do, I do think you make valid points.

2968
02:34:35,600 --> 02:34:37,240
I appreciate your perspective for sure.

2969
02:34:37,680 --> 02:34:42,280
I do think there is, I think there is a Venn diagram of what you're

2970
02:34:42,280 --> 02:34:43,160
saying and what I'm saying.

2971
02:34:43,160 --> 02:34:44,880
And there is a very, very large overlap.

2972
02:34:45,840 --> 02:34:46,200
Oh yeah.

2973
02:34:46,240 --> 02:34:46,440
Yeah.

2974
02:34:46,480 --> 02:34:51,000
Like we're, we're in, in the, in the, in the, what we want to see, uh, we are,

2975
02:34:51,040 --> 02:34:54,520
you know, 90% overlap and we just kind of like kick out at the edges.

2976
02:34:54,520 --> 02:34:55,520
And that's what we're talking about.

2977
02:34:55,520 --> 02:34:56,680
Cause that's what conversation is.

2978
02:34:56,680 --> 02:35:00,240
We don't, when, when two people are talking, they don't vehemently

2979
02:35:00,240 --> 02:35:01,280
agree with each other.

2980
02:35:01,280 --> 02:35:03,040
No, you're exactly correct.

2981
02:35:03,040 --> 02:35:04,600
And this is why you're correct.

2982
02:35:05,080 --> 02:35:07,920
So, you know, uh, it's social, social process.

2983
02:35:07,920 --> 02:35:10,280
It's just, it's a, it's yeah.

2984
02:35:10,280 --> 02:35:12,240
It's just a lot of, a lot of goings on.

2985
02:35:12,240 --> 02:35:12,560
Yeah.

2986
02:35:12,560 --> 02:35:16,600
I've had my, I had my fallout with a, uh, with the, with a anti-vax individual.

2987
02:35:16,600 --> 02:35:21,240
I've had my political fallouts in particular, uh, only, only increasing

2988
02:35:21,240 --> 02:35:25,520
as society, you know, as, as societal events happen and all that kind of stuff.

2989
02:35:25,840 --> 02:35:30,440
I, I, I wish things were discussed differently.

2990
02:35:30,480 --> 02:35:32,600
I couldn't tell you exactly how that is.

2991
02:35:32,600 --> 02:35:36,160
This is the simplification and conversation effect.

2992
02:35:36,480 --> 02:35:41,120
Um, we re we rail against the echo chamber, but there is a general

2993
02:35:41,120 --> 02:35:45,000
mentality mindset of this channel and we have our own echo chamber.

2994
02:35:45,560 --> 02:35:48,160
Uh, but yeah, it's all about scale.

2995
02:35:48,160 --> 02:35:49,640
Everything is different at the high scale.

2996
02:35:49,680 --> 02:35:52,920
Everything is different when every party is involved, uh, you

2997
02:35:52,920 --> 02:35:54,440
know, and, and nobody is happy.

2998
02:35:54,840 --> 02:35:58,120
I I'm, I'm not, I'm not saying anybody is wrong.

2999
02:35:58,200 --> 02:36:00,000
Uh, I'm saying events happen.

3000
02:36:00,320 --> 02:36:04,840
Uh, Facebook is right to be demonized to the extent that they have a hand in it.

3001
02:36:05,240 --> 02:36:06,720
That's very hard to prescribe.

3002
02:36:06,720 --> 02:36:09,760
And when you're, you know, when you're, when you're making a counterpoint, you

3003
02:36:09,760 --> 02:36:14,480
don't say, well, I'll say 20% of the good things I like about you and the 80% that

3004
02:36:14,480 --> 02:36:16,080
I disagree with, it doesn't, it doesn't work that way.

3005
02:36:16,400 --> 02:36:19,600
I get it just kind of wanted to, wanted to, like I said,

3006
02:36:19,600 --> 02:36:21,640
throw more than 15, 20 seconds out there.

3007
02:36:22,000 --> 02:36:24,440
Fifth dream in chat says, I love this response.

3008
02:36:24,640 --> 02:36:25,880
You're exactly right.

3009
02:36:25,880 --> 02:36:27,520
You son of a wonderful lady.

3010
02:36:30,160 --> 02:36:33,400
I hope your family is healthy for the knowledge that you imparted.

3011
02:36:33,600 --> 02:36:35,240
I hope you all have a great day.

3012
02:36:35,960 --> 02:36:37,360
Um, here's the thing here.

3013
02:36:37,360 --> 02:36:38,440
Here it is at the end of the day.

3014
02:36:39,400 --> 02:36:39,840
Go ahead.

3015
02:36:39,880 --> 02:36:42,520
That's just a very moonlighting thing to say.

3016
02:36:44,000 --> 02:36:48,640
Um, here's the thing I, and I, I'm not like, I don't criticize anyone for using

3017
02:36:48,640 --> 02:36:51,520
Facebook, I get, I'm on Facebook, I post on Facebook.

3018
02:36:53,040 --> 02:36:56,680
I, I would encourage everyone who's on social media to do this.

3019
02:36:57,760 --> 02:37:01,240
Stop letting social media manipulate you.

3020
02:37:01,960 --> 02:37:06,240
If you're about to get on a comment and type, fuck you, you fucking fuck.

3021
02:37:07,320 --> 02:37:12,720
Stop and ask yourself, am I being manipulated to have this reaction?

3022
02:37:13,560 --> 02:37:16,880
Is there something about this that is manipulating this conflict to happen?

3023
02:37:17,520 --> 02:37:21,160
Cause if you really stop and kind of choose those types of responses

3024
02:37:21,160 --> 02:37:25,160
appropriately, I think you might have an awakening as to what social media

3025
02:37:25,160 --> 02:37:26,600
is really trying to invoke out of you.

3026
02:37:27,000 --> 02:37:29,720
But you know what, if you're using Facebook to post pictures of the cat

3027
02:37:29,720 --> 02:37:30,880
and what you're having for lunch.

3028
02:37:31,080 --> 02:37:31,600
Cool.

3029
02:37:31,720 --> 02:37:32,480
I love that stuff.

3030
02:37:33,640 --> 02:37:34,920
Hide the post and move on.

3031
02:37:35,400 --> 02:37:37,600
Don't, don't, don't feed, don't feed the monster.

3032
02:37:37,600 --> 02:37:38,960
Don't feed the engagement machine.

3033
02:37:39,720 --> 02:37:41,720
Seek out what you do want and not what you don't.

3034
02:37:43,920 --> 02:37:44,280
All right.

3035
02:37:44,480 --> 02:37:47,720
Bobby Blackwell says, on the other hand, please let VOG influence you.

3036
02:37:49,960 --> 02:37:54,440
You know, I just post stuff about streaming and Dead by Daylight

3037
02:37:55,000 --> 02:37:56,760
and Transformers fan art.

3038
02:37:57,040 --> 02:38:01,120
And it's funny you say that because Mike Deff says, is Twitch the same though?

3039
02:38:01,680 --> 02:38:03,440
In some ways, yes.

3040
02:38:03,480 --> 02:38:06,920
I, and I, when I say any social media, I include Twitch in that.

3041
02:38:07,160 --> 02:38:10,160
Ask yourself, am I being manipulated right now to have a

3042
02:38:10,160 --> 02:38:11,480
particular reaction to something?

3043
02:38:11,840 --> 02:38:16,480
Because I can always, I can always choose to not respond.

3044
02:38:18,680 --> 02:38:22,960
Any service that puts something on you because we think you'll like it.

3045
02:38:24,480 --> 02:38:26,720
Not that, you know, not that decisions happen in the void.

3046
02:38:26,760 --> 02:38:28,000
It's all, it's all very complicated.

3047
02:38:28,000 --> 02:38:31,520
This is a, this is an incredibly complicated topic and never, never

3048
02:38:31,520 --> 02:38:32,840
solved because people are people.

3049
02:38:33,400 --> 02:38:36,840
And we will continue this process into a, into eternity.

3050
02:38:37,080 --> 02:38:38,960
And once we stop, somebody else takes it up.

3051
02:38:39,000 --> 02:38:39,880
Cause that's how it works.

3052
02:38:39,960 --> 02:38:43,360
Look forward to our future spinoff show, Orange Lounge Art Bellio.

3053
02:38:45,640 --> 02:38:46,120
All right.

3054
02:38:47,280 --> 02:38:47,800
Anyway.

3055
02:38:48,240 --> 02:38:49,520
Uh, thank you, Jason.

3056
02:38:49,560 --> 02:38:52,600
It was a lovely call and it's always good to hear from you and thanks for

3057
02:38:52,600 --> 02:38:54,520
everything, thanks for everything you do.

3058
02:38:54,560 --> 02:38:57,280
Um, the, those of you out there may not realize how much Jason

3059
02:38:57,280 --> 02:38:58,440
does for Orange Lounge Radio.

3060
02:38:58,640 --> 02:38:59,800
Yes, he does the voiceovers.

3061
02:39:00,480 --> 02:39:05,360
Jason just saved me two minutes a week in pre-production today with a very simple

3062
02:39:05,360 --> 02:39:08,240
thought of behind the scenes thing and how we transfer some of the

3063
02:39:08,240 --> 02:39:09,720
intro files and all that stuff.

3064
02:39:10,040 --> 02:39:12,640
Um, and it's one of those things where like, when you say it, it's

3065
02:39:12,640 --> 02:39:16,160
like, why didn't we think of this very obvious thing before?

3066
02:39:16,160 --> 02:39:19,440
And now it's like, Oh, and I just, I don't know if you saw the tweet I wrote,

3067
02:39:19,440 --> 02:39:22,880
but I was like, it just goes to show, you can be doing something for 19 years

3068
02:39:22,880 --> 02:39:24,280
and there's still ways to do it better.

3069
02:39:24,720 --> 02:39:27,400
Yeah, we've been doing, we've been doing this particular process for

3070
02:39:27,400 --> 02:39:28,640
what, two years and change now?

3071
02:39:28,640 --> 02:39:31,800
And I've now saved you an hour every year.

3072
02:39:32,040 --> 02:39:35,040
It, it's not to say it was bad or it was wrong.

3073
02:39:35,040 --> 02:39:38,120
It got the job done, but now, you know, those two minutes a week that you're

3074
02:39:38,160 --> 02:39:40,840
right, they'll add it that I will save an hour a year.

3075
02:39:40,840 --> 02:39:43,880
That is an hour that I can spend looking at pornography.

3076
02:39:43,920 --> 02:39:44,840
So thank you, Jason.

3077
02:39:44,840 --> 02:39:45,320
I thank you.

3078
02:39:46,080 --> 02:39:48,880
Also readily available on every corner of the internet.

3079
02:39:48,920 --> 02:39:51,080
Just seek out, seek, seek out what you want.

3080
02:39:51,080 --> 02:39:52,040
Not what people try to get.

3081
02:39:52,040 --> 02:39:54,240
That they don't advertise to me on Facebook.

3082
02:39:56,160 --> 02:39:57,880
All right, Jason, my friend, take care of everybody.

3083
02:39:57,880 --> 02:39:58,320
Have a good night.

3084
02:39:58,320 --> 02:39:58,600
Okay.

3085
02:39:58,920 --> 02:40:00,120
Orange land radio people.

3086
02:40:00,120 --> 02:40:00,960
You're wonderful.

3087
02:40:00,960 --> 02:40:03,080
And I thank you for listening because you're wonderful.

3088
02:40:03,080 --> 02:40:03,920
Son of a nice lady.

3089
02:40:03,920 --> 02:40:04,920
Thank you for being here.

3090
02:40:05,320 --> 02:40:06,600
How dare you be so cool.

3091
02:40:06,960 --> 02:40:07,280
All right.

3092
02:40:07,760 --> 02:40:08,480
Take care, buddy.

3093
02:40:11,720 --> 02:40:12,600
Love to hear from him.

3094
02:40:12,600 --> 02:40:13,280
We have another call.

3095
02:40:13,280 --> 02:40:13,920
Let's get to it.

3096
02:40:13,920 --> 02:40:14,880
We got calls tonight.

3097
02:40:14,880 --> 02:40:15,360
I love it.

3098
02:40:15,360 --> 02:40:15,560
Hi.

3099
02:40:15,560 --> 02:40:16,400
You're on orange launch radio.

3100
02:40:16,400 --> 02:40:16,880
Who's this?

3101
02:40:20,240 --> 02:40:21,400
Rama.

3102
02:40:22,120 --> 02:40:23,400
I can't hear anybody.

3103
02:40:23,840 --> 02:40:24,760
We can hear you.

3104
02:40:25,920 --> 02:40:26,240
Okay.

3105
02:40:26,240 --> 02:40:26,920
He's got his hand.

3106
02:40:26,920 --> 02:40:29,760
He's frustrated because he can't hear us, but we can hear him.

3107
02:40:30,320 --> 02:40:34,320
I just, he's got to go to his discord audio settings output.

3108
02:40:34,320 --> 02:40:35,640
What the heck is going on here?

3109
02:40:36,640 --> 02:40:41,320
We'll just, we're going to just listen to a moment while DJ Rama S has a inner monologue.

3110
02:40:42,400 --> 02:40:44,640
We could also play a joke and just not say anything.

3111
02:40:45,520 --> 02:40:46,800
I don't think it's still broken.

3112
02:40:47,320 --> 02:40:47,960
We could.

3113
02:40:48,440 --> 02:40:53,160
How do I explain due to the unfreezing process that I don't have an internal monologue.

3114
02:40:53,240 --> 02:40:54,560
Rama just said in chat.

3115
02:40:55,240 --> 02:40:56,280
Uh, damn it.

3116
02:40:56,320 --> 02:40:57,880
I'm sorry, y'all I'm out.

3117
02:40:57,880 --> 02:40:59,200
Uh, that's okay.

3118
02:40:59,840 --> 02:41:06,240
The depression is well, I hope whatever I DJ Rama S you nice person.

3119
02:41:07,600 --> 02:41:09,640
How dare you contribute to our program?

3120
02:41:11,120 --> 02:41:11,520
All right.

3121
02:41:12,480 --> 02:41:13,840
Hopefully it'll get fixed for next time.

3122
02:41:14,040 --> 02:41:15,200
Hey, let's check in.

3123
02:41:15,200 --> 02:41:17,920
So I think I heard you say earlier, uh, dark soccer.

3124
02:41:17,920 --> 02:41:22,960
There was no email, but all I can say is that, uh, there was no email, but all I can say is

3125
02:41:22,960 --> 02:41:27,800
that, uh, there was no email, but all I can say is that, uh, there was no email.

3126
02:41:28,840 --> 02:41:29,200
Okay.

3127
02:41:29,600 --> 02:41:30,840
Uh, yeah, I love that.

3128
02:41:30,880 --> 02:41:32,680
Uh, Jason with a good point there.

3129
02:41:32,680 --> 02:41:35,560
If you want his opinions, listen to anime jam session.

3130
02:41:35,600 --> 02:41:36,080
Very good.

3131
02:41:36,080 --> 02:41:36,720
Love that plug.

3132
02:41:37,120 --> 02:41:37,360
Love it.

3133
02:41:37,360 --> 02:41:37,600
Love it.

3134
02:41:37,920 --> 02:41:40,400
Um, let's talk about last minute stories.

3135
02:41:40,400 --> 02:41:40,680
Loki.

3136
02:41:40,680 --> 02:41:42,240
I don't know if you have anything you want to share with us tonight.

3137
02:41:42,920 --> 02:41:43,720
Yes.

3138
02:41:43,800 --> 02:41:49,880
The saga continues now, the saga being the Intellivision saga.

3139
02:41:50,440 --> 02:41:53,800
So now they got an email, they sent me an email today and I ignored it.

3140
02:41:53,800 --> 02:41:54,320
What happened?

3141
02:41:54,880 --> 02:42:00,440
So today they announced that, um, even though the system isn't out yet, they are going to be selling

3142
02:42:00,440 --> 02:42:06,240
the physical versions of the game, the games, or at least some of the games that you can purchase

3143
02:42:06,240 --> 02:42:13,200
now, uh, for limited time bundles, ranging from $80 to $150 with, I think it was like four or

3144
02:42:13,200 --> 02:42:14,640
eight copies of the games.

3145
02:42:14,880 --> 02:42:18,600
I don't know if you can purchase these individually, but if you buy all eight, it's 150

3146
02:42:18,600 --> 02:42:18,960
bucks.

3147
02:42:19,360 --> 02:42:25,680
And what you get in those physical versions is basically the, like a manual, like our little

3148
02:42:25,680 --> 02:42:27,160
card, that's a lenticular card.

3149
02:42:27,200 --> 02:42:35,880
You get a collector coin and also the game itself, which is an RFID, um, card.

3150
02:42:36,280 --> 02:42:41,280
But the thing that's unique about it and just it's buzzwords being thrown out, but apparently

3151
02:42:41,280 --> 02:42:48,000
the card itself is like, it's like an NFT almost where in the sense that you it's a digital copy

3152
02:42:48,040 --> 02:42:48,400
of the game.

3153
02:42:48,400 --> 02:42:51,320
Cause there's really no physical games you can plug into the console.

3154
02:42:51,320 --> 02:42:55,560
So when you scan it into your system, it basically ties that game to your system.

3155
02:42:55,560 --> 02:43:03,080
But because of blockchain, you're then also able to later sell that copy to somebody else, another

3156
02:43:03,080 --> 02:43:09,200
Amico owner, and then you can transfer that game using the blockchain and NFTs or something like

3157
02:43:09,200 --> 02:43:09,440
that.

3158
02:43:10,560 --> 02:43:11,240
Interesting.

3159
02:43:12,240 --> 02:43:21,280
It's a neat way around the, uh, the, um, the whole digital thing, but at the same time, you're

3160
02:43:21,280 --> 02:43:23,800
buying games for a console that's not out yet.

3161
02:43:24,280 --> 02:43:27,880
Well, I, and Bobby does make a good point and this, uh, actually escaped to me.

3162
02:43:27,880 --> 02:43:30,840
I did not realize today is 10, 10, 20, 21.

3163
02:43:31,000 --> 02:43:35,680
This is the third release date of the, uh, television Amico, but I'm not, I'm not going to

3164
02:43:35,680 --> 02:43:38,080
shade them for missing the release dates.

3165
02:43:38,680 --> 02:43:42,880
Like there are other things that, you know, have been discussed, but as far as the release dates go,

3166
02:43:42,880 --> 02:43:48,320
look, you still can't walk into a target and get a PlayStation five, you know, cars are hard, the

3167
02:43:48,320 --> 02:43:49,760
chip shortage and all that stuff.

3168
02:43:49,760 --> 02:43:51,480
It's real and it's affecting everything.

3169
02:43:51,480 --> 02:43:53,280
So I'm not going to shade in television on that point.

3170
02:43:53,640 --> 02:43:57,800
Um, they've had to delayed for several times now, so it is what it is.

3171
02:43:57,800 --> 02:44:03,080
So that was a little thing they put out on this, um, third release date target that they've had to

3172
02:44:03,080 --> 02:44:06,040
miss due to a fault that is legitimate.

3173
02:44:06,160 --> 02:44:06,880
I think.

3174
02:44:07,880 --> 02:44:08,200
Yeah.

3175
02:44:08,680 --> 02:44:14,280
Um, I'm still wary, like I'll wait for this whole console to be released and come out and see the

3176
02:44:14,280 --> 02:44:16,400
reviews and look at the games and stuff like that.

3177
02:44:16,400 --> 02:44:24,960
I mean, you know, just, I just don't, I just not, no, no fault to Tommy here, but like NFTs right now

3178
02:44:24,960 --> 02:44:28,440
are kind of a, it's just kind of a really shady gray area.

3179
02:44:28,480 --> 02:44:34,560
There's a lot of, the intent with NFTs is to be able to pay like artists for some of these digital

3180
02:44:34,560 --> 02:44:42,600
works, but there's a lot of people, celebrities and influencers exploiting this process to a really

3181
02:44:42,760 --> 02:44:44,120
obscene degree.

3182
02:44:44,120 --> 02:44:47,680
And so it's just kind of has a real negative connotation to it right now.

3183
02:44:48,760 --> 02:44:52,640
And just to throw this in here and I get it the whole, it's not really an NFT.

3184
02:44:52,640 --> 02:44:57,320
It's just more of like a way to be able to transfer ownership of a digital product, which is.

3185
02:44:57,480 --> 02:44:58,280
I like it is.

3186
02:44:58,400 --> 02:44:59,680
I like the way Bobby put it.

3187
02:44:59,680 --> 02:45:04,360
It's only an NFT if it's from the nifty region of France, otherwise it's a sparkling blockchain.

3188
02:45:04,400 --> 02:45:05,000
Yes.

3189
02:45:06,040 --> 02:45:06,920
It's, you know what though?

3190
02:45:06,920 --> 02:45:08,440
I, I, that's excellent.

3191
02:45:08,840 --> 02:45:15,120
I, this is one of the better uses I've heard of it compared to a lot of weird shit out there.

3192
02:45:15,120 --> 02:45:19,880
Like, did you hear the dark Sakura, not to keep shifting the conversation back to dead by daylight, but did you hear

3193
02:45:19,880 --> 02:45:24,160
the whole thing about why those voice lines from dead by daylight for pinhead got removed?

3194
02:45:24,440 --> 02:45:29,680
Because they wanted to do more stuff by like selling NFTs of that to enable it.

3195
02:45:30,040 --> 02:45:32,120
Yeah, it was really wild shit.

3196
02:45:32,360 --> 02:45:36,720
Like, and I hope, I hope that was somebody's fan fan stuff or whatever.

3197
02:45:37,480 --> 02:45:42,760
If, yeah, well, I was trying, I'm still trying to get my head wrapped around the MMR.

3198
02:45:42,760 --> 02:45:43,240
So whatever.

3199
02:45:45,600 --> 02:45:45,760
All right.

3200
02:45:45,760 --> 02:45:46,760
Anyway, sorry.

3201
02:45:46,760 --> 02:45:48,480
Uh, Loki, I don't know if you had a further point with that.

3202
02:45:49,040 --> 02:45:50,560
No, that's, that's about it.

3203
02:45:50,560 --> 02:45:55,040
So yeah, right now you can buy the physical versions of, uh, eight different games.

3204
02:45:55,040 --> 02:45:57,560
They have two paths of four or you can buy a pack of eight.

3205
02:45:58,080 --> 02:45:58,600
Um,

3206
02:45:58,600 --> 02:46:00,080
no, all right.

3207
02:46:00,080 --> 02:46:05,840
I'm not going to be, we're going to go back to the, to be fair though, the box art's really nice.

3208
02:46:05,840 --> 02:46:07,720
I do really like the boxes for them.

3209
02:46:08,040 --> 02:46:09,640
Just no, no.

3210
02:46:10,040 --> 02:46:10,480
All right.

3211
02:46:10,480 --> 02:46:16,400
We're going to try this again because, uh, we actually had a call screener help and get, uh, all this trouble sorted.

3212
02:46:16,680 --> 02:46:19,480
So let's try to welcome back to the program Rama.

3213
02:46:22,360 --> 02:46:28,320
There is one thing I have told people, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never,

3214
02:46:28,320 --> 02:46:31,200
never skimp out on your hardware.

3215
02:46:31,560 --> 02:46:32,880
And that's what I did.

3216
02:46:33,160 --> 02:46:35,040
I did not heed my own advice.

3217
02:46:36,560 --> 02:46:36,880
All right.

3218
02:46:36,880 --> 02:46:38,080
Well, what's on your mind tonight, buddy?

3219
02:46:38,760 --> 02:46:38,960
All right.

3220
02:46:38,960 --> 02:46:44,000
First, I just want to say your, your comment about Facebook and so forth for about engaging people.

3221
02:46:44,040 --> 02:46:44,840
I'll make this very quick.

3222
02:46:46,360 --> 02:46:47,960
That's part of the reason why I am in there.

3223
02:46:48,040 --> 02:46:50,320
I talked to my therapist about stuff like that.

3224
02:46:50,320 --> 02:46:57,920
Cause let's just say I just came off of another band because somebody made a comment about COVID and I

3225
02:46:57,920 --> 02:47:03,120
called them out and I got put in Facebook state penitentiary for repeat jail.

3226
02:47:03,160 --> 02:47:05,120
Yes, yes, I am.

3227
02:47:05,360 --> 02:47:05,840
Yes.

3228
02:47:05,920 --> 02:47:09,760
You frequent flyer stamp card for the Facebook jail, Rama.

3229
02:47:10,840 --> 02:47:15,360
I have like the, like the little awards, like the little medals that they have, you know, when you're in the

3230
02:47:15,360 --> 02:47:19,080
military, that, you know, but I, I do find it ridiculous.

3231
02:47:19,120 --> 02:47:25,200
You get sent to Facebook jail and then there's all this other, but I'm exhausted on that point.

3232
02:47:25,200 --> 02:47:26,560
So I'm just going to defer to you.

3233
02:47:27,480 --> 02:47:28,280
Exactly.

3234
02:47:28,320 --> 02:47:28,960
Thank you.

3235
02:47:29,320 --> 02:47:31,000
But I didn't call in about that.

3236
02:47:31,080 --> 02:47:33,360
I just want to talk about this whole Twitch thing real quick.

3237
02:47:33,360 --> 02:47:37,560
Cause you know, I just find this thing absolutely hilarious.

3238
02:47:37,920 --> 02:47:43,200
People losing their minds about these Twitch creators making so much money.

3239
02:47:43,440 --> 02:47:47,400
Why are you mad that Twitch creators are making a million dollars?

3240
02:47:47,600 --> 02:47:49,320
You made them rich.

3241
02:47:49,440 --> 02:47:51,440
You threw them their money.

3242
02:47:51,560 --> 02:47:52,920
You did all of this.

3243
02:47:53,040 --> 02:47:54,960
I just sat there and watch you do it.

3244
02:47:55,120 --> 02:48:01,200
But now you find out they're pulling a million five every month, somebody, and you want to be salty about that.

3245
02:48:01,560 --> 02:48:03,200
You want to, are you ready?

3246
02:48:05,200 --> 02:48:06,160
Hold on, hold on.

3247
02:48:06,160 --> 02:48:08,120
Cause item number two will shock you.

3248
02:48:08,320 --> 02:48:08,840
You ready?

3249
02:48:09,440 --> 02:48:09,640
Yeah.

3250
02:48:09,640 --> 02:48:09,880
Yeah.

3251
02:48:10,120 --> 02:48:17,160
That's not all of the money they're making either because there are sponsorship deals that many of them have and will do

3252
02:48:17,160 --> 02:48:19,520
sponsored content and will use certain equipment.

3253
02:48:20,160 --> 02:48:21,000
So guess what?

3254
02:48:21,000 --> 02:48:23,480
They're making more than that list that came out.

3255
02:48:24,960 --> 02:48:26,000
And it gets to like that.

3256
02:48:26,000 --> 02:48:28,720
You know, what's funny is the larger creator you become.

3257
02:48:28,720 --> 02:48:34,480
So the more money that you're making and really don't need any of the free handouts, the more free handouts you get.

3258
02:48:34,840 --> 02:48:38,280
So it's a nice problem to have, I guess.

3259
02:48:38,360 --> 02:48:39,360
And then guess what?

3260
02:48:39,360 --> 02:48:44,440
By, by putting out all this outrage about how you're so mad that so-and-so is making a lot of money.

3261
02:48:44,600 --> 02:48:47,560
You are continuing to put their name out there.

3262
02:48:47,560 --> 02:48:52,000
It's like that one YouTuber that constantly, and I don't care what his name is.

3263
02:48:52,000 --> 02:48:58,800
You all know him, that one YouTuber that's always constantly doing stupid shit that always shows up because he's doing stupid shit.

3264
02:48:59,240 --> 02:49:05,520
Honestly, I could probably be describing three different people, probably more, but anyway, go ahead, Ram.

3265
02:49:05,520 --> 02:49:06,000
I'm sorry.

3266
02:49:06,680 --> 02:49:08,680
Oh no, no, you're, you're absolutely right.

3267
02:49:09,080 --> 02:49:12,040
This is one reason why I don't follow like the top 1%.

3268
02:49:12,120 --> 02:49:15,200
I like the squad of people that I roll with.

3269
02:49:15,240 --> 02:49:15,640
Okay.

3270
02:49:16,000 --> 02:49:21,120
I hang out with Twitch streamers between one and a hundred.

3271
02:49:22,520 --> 02:49:23,600
I'm good with that.

3272
02:49:24,080 --> 02:49:32,840
But the main thing that had me rolling was the fans getting upset about how much money Critical Role was bringing in and get upset about that.

3273
02:49:32,960 --> 02:49:33,560
Hold up.

3274
02:49:33,760 --> 02:49:42,760
You have to understand at the beginning of the pandemic, a lot of voice actors could not go into the studio, so they weren't making any money.

3275
02:49:43,320 --> 02:49:45,000
They're on Twitch doing things.

3276
02:49:45,160 --> 02:49:50,200
Thank God for Steve Blue, who came up with a great idea for Critical Role, not Steve Blue, oh, Matt Mercer.

3277
02:49:50,520 --> 02:49:51,680
He came up with this great idea.

3278
02:49:52,000 --> 02:49:55,200
Voice acting friends putting it together and they're selling merch.

3279
02:49:55,840 --> 02:50:05,720
They got sponsorships and everything, but also this is paying for their livelihoods and it's also paying for the equipment that they're doing to make this show.

3280
02:50:05,920 --> 02:50:06,800
It's not cheap.

3281
02:50:07,320 --> 02:50:08,120
Exactly.

3282
02:50:08,400 --> 02:50:16,360
When I got my first quarterly dividend, you know, from, from Twitch streaming, I'll straight up say it.

3283
02:50:16,720 --> 02:50:18,960
It's about $120.

3284
02:50:18,960 --> 02:50:19,360
Okay.

3285
02:50:19,760 --> 02:50:24,720
That's paid for my web hosting, my domains and everything for a year.

3286
02:50:25,360 --> 02:50:25,960
And I'm good.

3287
02:50:26,760 --> 02:50:36,680
Even if I didn't get that much, I'm like, okay, I'm so used to paying for stuff out of pocket because I do this for the fun of it.

3288
02:50:36,720 --> 02:50:37,200
Okay.

3289
02:50:37,200 --> 02:50:37,760
Hear it again.

3290
02:50:38,000 --> 02:50:39,240
The fun of it.

3291
02:50:39,560 --> 02:50:45,320
Oh, mostly Twitch streamers are doing this for the fun of it and they're giving back and they're doing this and doing that.

3292
02:50:45,480 --> 02:50:50,840
The ones you got to look out for are the ones that are just in it for the money and don't give a damn about you.

3293
02:50:50,920 --> 02:50:57,840
So if you're going to get upset about this one Twitch streamer making 2.5, guess what, my friend, they don't give a damn about you.

3294
02:51:01,720 --> 02:51:10,520
Ladies and gentlemen, I'm leaving the show and just turning it over to Rama because that part that please go, please go back and watch the video on demand of this part of the show.

3295
02:51:10,560 --> 02:51:11,680
Just that's all I'm going to say to you Rama.

3296
02:51:12,120 --> 02:51:17,640
Um, like, yes, like it is Bobby, I know you're there.

3297
02:51:17,720 --> 02:51:21,360
Um, how much are the legal zoom fees for VOG network for a year?

3298
02:51:22,520 --> 02:51:29,960
Can you, can you let me know that because that is money that we're not paying out of pocket anymore.

3299
02:51:30,200 --> 02:51:35,760
I know some of you are very sad that we left shout cast, but I can't tell you how nice it is that we're not paying.

3300
02:51:36,320 --> 02:51:40,000
What was it was $120 every three months or something like that to run that thing.

3301
02:51:40,000 --> 02:51:40,320
I don't know.

3302
02:51:40,320 --> 02:51:41,080
It's been a while now.

3303
02:51:41,560 --> 02:51:43,440
Um, we don't have to pay that out of pocket anymore.

3304
02:51:43,760 --> 02:51:49,280
Um, and you guys are able to fund this through biddies and subs and all that, that when, okay, thank you.

3305
02:51:49,280 --> 02:51:53,680
Bobby says it is, uh, taxes and legal zoom comes to 600 to $700 a year.

3306
02:51:54,240 --> 02:52:03,120
The good news is your bitty and sub money means that Bobby Blackwolf, Rob Roberts and the rest of the company here at VOG network are not paying that out of pocket.

3307
02:52:03,160 --> 02:52:03,720
Thank you.

3308
02:52:04,520 --> 02:52:11,600
Thank you for legitimizing what we do so that when we want to do things like sponsor cons and, and, you know, do those types of, we can do that.

3309
02:52:12,000 --> 02:52:19,040
So, you know, no, I'm not making a million dollars or anything like that, but we're able to do this fun thing.

3310
02:52:20,920 --> 02:52:24,240
For free and it's cool to be, it's because of you guys.

3311
02:52:24,240 --> 02:52:24,760
Thank you.

3312
02:52:25,040 --> 02:52:33,000
Um, and, um, you know, there's some people on that list, like earlier in this, I don't think I necessarily want to dodge people just because they're popular.

3313
02:52:33,120 --> 02:52:35,200
I name checked Pokimane earlier.

3314
02:52:35,360 --> 02:52:36,120
I think she's great.

3315
02:52:36,240 --> 02:52:39,360
I think she's, you know, and she's got a lot of great perspective on things.

3316
02:52:39,600 --> 02:52:45,440
Now watch, I'm going to say that and somebody's going to find the cancelable statement, but as far as I know, she's, she's great.

3317
02:52:45,440 --> 02:52:47,400
And she's a positive influence on Twitch and all that stuff.

3318
02:52:47,400 --> 02:52:57,000
I'm happy for her, you know, and, and again, like if y'all are mad that these entertainers are making millions of dollars, wait until I tell you what actors and actresses make.

3319
02:52:57,480 --> 02:53:18,680
Uh, but in the big Hollywoods and there, but you know what, for every ScarJo, for every Chris Pratt, for every, for any of those A-listers, there are people working at theaters, um, improv troops, uh, community related stuff.

3320
02:53:19,520 --> 02:53:25,320
We've all heard the stories about waiting tables, trying out for reality shows and people that are for a reason.

3321
02:53:25,440 --> 02:53:30,400
People that are trying to push that dream that are just having a problem breaking through that barrier.

3322
02:53:30,800 --> 02:53:41,320
So now I think the only problem we need to address as a society and you're seeing it happen in Hollywood slowly, but it's happening.

3323
02:53:42,360 --> 02:53:55,200
And you're going to see it soon on Twitch is going to be about now, why doesn't the high paid actors and actresses reflect the actual population makeup of this country?

3324
02:53:56,320 --> 02:54:08,520
And that's now, I think the harsh reality a lot of us are looking at with Twitch is now here is the proof that at this time, only a certain group is widely successful on this platform.

3325
02:54:09,920 --> 02:54:18,920
So that is that, but that is a, an issue much larger than our little, you know, bottom 99% show we have here on Twitch.

3326
02:54:18,920 --> 02:54:42,920
Uh, She-Hulk 10 is suggesting O-L-R in a hot tub equals big money, do not tempt me because I want a hot tub to be in, uh, grandpa, grandpa, shut up, watch, uh, grandma, uh, grandpa Warcraft from Hoard House has a hot tub and has offered to do a hot tub stream.

3327
02:54:42,920 --> 02:54:46,320
So look out, you might get it.

3328
02:54:46,720 --> 02:54:58,720
Rob, I'm telling you this right now, if this is confirmed, I'm getting my best masks, I'm getting a round trip ticket, I will show up as James Brown or we can recreate that, that Saturday Night Live sti-

3329
02:54:58,720 --> 02:55:00,720
James Brown hot tub party.

3330
02:55:00,720 --> 02:55:02,720
Okay, we can do that.

3331
02:55:04,720 --> 02:55:09,720
I just want you and grandpa to hang out IRL cause I think the two of you would just keep me laughing all fucking night.

3332
02:55:09,720 --> 02:55:10,720
Like I wouldn't even have to drink.

3333
02:55:11,120 --> 02:55:13,120
I will be, I, oh, trust me, you will be drinking.

3334
02:55:13,120 --> 02:55:18,120
Um, I'm just, I just want a hot tub.

3335
02:55:18,120 --> 02:55:19,120
We can make it happen.

3336
02:55:19,120 --> 02:55:20,120
I love it.

3337
02:55:20,120 --> 02:55:24,120
I love how I'm volunteering, but I c I could call him live right now and I'd be like, hey, we're coming up there next weekend for a hot tub party.

3338
02:55:24,120 --> 02:55:25,120
He'd just be like, cool.

3339
02:55:25,120 --> 02:55:30,540
Don't care. I love how I'm volunteering, but I could call him live right now, and I'd be like hey

3340
02:55:30,540 --> 02:55:33,320
We're coming up there next weekend for a hot tub party. He'd just be like cool

3341
02:55:35,860 --> 02:55:41,940
Actually one of my good friends who you've seen in my channel, I'm sure amethyst Rose, which she showed up in here, too

3342
02:55:42,040 --> 02:55:48,040
Mm-hmm. Oh, yeah, I go use her hot tub good to own good. I'm wearing a webcam good times all right

3343
02:55:48,040 --> 02:55:50,440

3350
02:56:07,840 --> 02:56:14,800
Quote by one of the greatest wrestlers out there Booker T. Don't hate the play hate the game. That's all it is and on that

3351
02:56:15,440 --> 02:56:17,440
But the players got to play the game

3352
02:56:17,760 --> 02:56:20,560
Through it's a choice there you go

3353
02:56:20,560 --> 02:56:25,920
