WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:14.600
Oh Konami, we wouldn't be here without you and we lament your continued decline in everything

00:14.600 --> 00:18.920
except Imani. But now you're teasing new life in your largest franchises? Do I want

00:18.920 --> 00:24.560
classic Konami remakes? Yes. Do I want new titles of classic Konami franchises? Castlevania,

00:24.560 --> 00:30.280
Metal Gear, Silent Hill? Let's reserve judgment. This is the headline about the publisher that

00:30.280 --> 00:33.560
catalyzed our collective. Now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Sommers and

00:33.560 --> 00:36.440
Loki to tell you more about this and the rest of the week's gaming news. Starting right

00:36.440 --> 00:38.440
now on the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:38.440 --> 00:45.720
Hello my friends out there on the internet. Welcome back to another week of the show where

00:45.720 --> 00:52.600
every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio and we are live once again with episode

00:52.640 --> 00:59.840
number 886 of our show for tonight, October the 3rd of 2021. I can't believe it's spooky

00:59.840 --> 01:05.040
season already, but happy Halloween a little early. My name is Rob Roberts and I'm here

01:05.040 --> 01:10.520
with you every week and joined by my co-hosts. Say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Sommers.

01:10.520 --> 01:15.040
You know Halloween season started on August 1st, right? Fair enough. Well, certainly by

01:15.040 --> 01:19.440
the time I was enjoying a pumpkin spice latte, was it spooky season? And that was like Dragon

01:19.440 --> 01:24.280
Con. That was like Labor Day. I have still not had one. Oh, you're missing out. Although

01:24.280 --> 01:29.160
I'm not missing out. Yes, you are. As I've said on a previous episode, the apple drink's

01:29.160 --> 01:36.880
pretty good too. I didn't have that because I hate caramel. Just get it without the caramel.

01:36.880 --> 01:42.840
No, I like it in the chai. It's actually, it's too strong actually. It's too sweet.

01:42.840 --> 01:46.840
So I'd have to have them do half as much. A lot of those, like even the pumpkin spice

01:46.840 --> 01:54.760
latte, the thing I absolutely loathe about it now is that it is so sweet. I cannot, I

01:54.760 --> 01:58.720
can't stomach it. It makes me nauseous. Try the cold brew with the foam because when

01:58.720 --> 02:02.920
they mix together, the bitterness of the cold brew kind of helps I think with that. It's

02:02.920 --> 02:05.920
a less sweet drink. Cold brew isn't supposed to be very bitter though. It does. It is to

02:05.920 --> 02:10.960
me. Well, it's coffee, so it tastes a little bitter to me. The thing about cold brew, okay,

02:10.960 --> 02:15.120
we're getting into coffee science and better put that aside. It's coffee talk. Let's talk

02:15.120 --> 02:23.640
about a pumpkin spice latte. A cold brew is neither cold nor a brew. Discuss. It really

02:23.640 --> 02:31.600
isn't a brew. It's like more like a steep. All right. Say hello as well to neither tech

02:31.600 --> 02:38.800
nor master. Say hello to Loki, everybody. Hello. How are you, Loki? I don't like the

02:38.800 --> 02:44.520
cold brew coffees. You don't really like coffee at all, do you? I'll drink like a wine mocha.

02:44.520 --> 02:53.040
That's about it. So you don't like real chocolate either? I don't really like a lot of things.

02:53.040 --> 02:57.920
I'm excited because Alan has to go run an errand. So he said on his way back he would

02:57.920 --> 03:03.840
go by and I, especially if you're West Coast, like Northwest Coast, you know, this place

03:03.840 --> 03:08.120
is crack. He's going by Dutch brothers on the way back. And that's like fucking love

03:08.120 --> 03:13.720
Dutch to hell with Starbucks. Honestly, they're not paying me to say that. I love I always

03:13.720 --> 03:17.460
get like the double mocha thing from them, even if it's going to make me super sick.

03:17.460 --> 03:22.200
That much chocolate makes me happy. My favorite part of Dutch brothers is how they they make

03:22.200 --> 03:27.440
their their locations way too small and don't account for any sort of traffic concern. Oh,

03:27.440 --> 03:33.920
yes. Always a disaster. Everything everywhere. They're just a big pain in the ass. And so

03:33.920 --> 03:39.880
it's just. Yay, Dutch brothers. And then everybody like has a stupid stickers on their car. And

03:39.880 --> 03:44.400
it's like, what is this role? How do we take it? How do we take the concept of a Trader

03:44.400 --> 03:51.000
Joe's parking lot and make it worse? Yeah. Yeah. Dutch brothers and Trader Joe's are

03:51.000 --> 03:57.080
the same people. And I swear, it's just like the same crowd. My wife is part of that crowd.

03:57.080 --> 04:02.160
I don't think she doesn't go to Dutch Brothers, but she sees the Trader Joe's crowd. And yeah,

04:02.160 --> 04:06.140
they're special. All right. Anyway, we're here to talk about games, not about Dutch

04:06.140 --> 04:11.460
Brothers and Trader Joe's, although you know, by the way, I bet Loki would like my dinner.

04:11.460 --> 04:16.500
What did you have for dinner? It is steak and shells and cheese. Oh, good. Yum. I'd

04:16.500 --> 04:22.040
like your dinner. Yeah, that was better than my, you know, one on the two month reminders

04:22.040 --> 04:26.860
that McDonald's food is not good. We're good today. But I did it. It was just I didn't

04:26.860 --> 04:33.180
have time. I wanted to go all the way down the Rancho to get this place they have. It's

04:34.140 --> 04:38.260
like steak sandwiches, but they have like a beef dip there. That's pretty good. I want

04:38.260 --> 04:43.700
to try that. But that's like all the way over in the Rancho. Or my other option was I want

04:43.700 --> 04:48.160
to go to Burger King. But once again, for some stupid reason, we have a black hole of

04:48.160 --> 04:53.840
Burger King in our area. And the closest Burger King is like 20 minutes away, one way or the

04:53.840 --> 04:57.380
other from me. I was gonna say there's one like right near I mean, not to give away my

04:57.380 --> 05:02.500
address on it, but there's one not far from the studio. So yeah, one of them's Yeah, it's

05:02.500 --> 05:07.900
just I don't know for some reason. They don't have Burger King's around me. They have everything

05:07.900 --> 05:13.940
else but not Burger King. Well, did get me chickie nugs from from the evil w come back

05:13.940 --> 05:20.860
to this point for some good old times and you can go by Burger King on your way. Sure.

05:20.860 --> 05:27.020
All right. The only fast food I really eat anymore is Del Taco. The one here. All right,

05:27.020 --> 05:33.660
we gotta get to games. Look, fine episode. Jim boys is probably maybe you know what,

05:33.660 --> 05:37.380
we haven't done a channel point reward in a long time. I think it was I think it was

05:37.380 --> 05:41.860
Bobby's turn and then it just didn't happen. But he's gonna be taking a little time off.

05:41.860 --> 05:44.780
So maybe we'll just have to do one again. And maybe we'll have to raise the channel

05:44.780 --> 05:50.140
points for an all food like that, like the purpose will be orange lounge foodie. Oh,

05:50.140 --> 05:54.420
and we will talk about nothing but food. I will have like 20 topics on food ready to

05:54.420 --> 06:01.620
go and we'll we'll have food eleganza. Exactly. Category is food, all food and we'll play

06:01.620 --> 06:06.380
we'll play power washing sim in the background just for the hell of it. We need to fucking

06:06.380 --> 06:13.180
talk about power washing sim. But first, our kickoff topic for tonight. Let's go to a story

06:13.180 --> 06:16.540
about Twitch. Well, why don't why don't we be self referential since we are doing our

06:16.540 --> 06:20.620
show on Twitch, because we do tape live every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific nine o'clock

06:20.620 --> 06:26.580
Eastern at the voice of geeks network, twitch.tv slash v o g network. Usually I would say we're

06:26.580 --> 06:30.420
right after the Bobby Blackwell show. But as he announced earlier this evening, he's going to be

06:30.420 --> 06:35.700
taking an unspecified amount of time off. I am having fingers and toes crossed the and full faith

06:35.700 --> 06:41.100
that it's just going to be one week. Although the reality is it could be a little longer, but we're

06:41.100 --> 06:45.060
just we're just going to err on the side of one week. And so we'll just we'll he'll just be taking

06:45.060 --> 06:49.220
a little vacation and then be back in two weeks. That's that's where I'm going to set my mind and

06:49.220 --> 06:54.340
positivity too. And if it doesn't turn out that way, then we'll deal with it later. All right. But

06:54.340 --> 06:58.580
anyhow, Twitch, our kickoff topics about Twitch, let's get into it on Loki, you want to kind of

06:58.580 --> 06:59.220
start us off here?

07:00.180 --> 07:08.260
I would be the the thing we linked is the wrong story. So I am looking it up right now. But yeah,

07:08.260 --> 07:14.620
basically, they've added some more functionality to Twitch chat to basically combat those bot

07:14.620 --> 07:16.540
raids and whatnot. So

07:16.820 --> 07:18.260
the verified account thing.

07:18.540 --> 07:26.620
Yeah, so that's nice that they're finally doing some of that stuff. Is it enough? I guess we'll

07:26.620 --> 07:27.500
wait and see.

07:27.660 --> 07:33.020
It's been kind of interesting, though, in some of my other friends channels. I haven't seen as

07:33.020 --> 07:38.980
much. Certainly I haven't seen the Haas show up as much in the last couple of days. The hose.

07:39.780 --> 07:45.580
I've seen the hose show up just one or two here or there, but drop a follow. And I think part of

07:45.580 --> 07:46.100
the problem

07:46.100 --> 07:51.060
they're banned immediately. Well, I don't when I go to that's for sure. When I go to know when I

07:51.060 --> 07:55.940
go to ban them, it says user doesn't exist. Oh, well, that's nice, I guess. But they started

07:55.940 --> 08:03.940
putting words in front of hose. So the hose requests or Yeah, fun or, you know, crap.

08:03.940 --> 08:09.140
So I don't know what those clowns are doing. But, you know, I do see them come through once in a

08:09.140 --> 08:14.980
while. So but but it's nice that, you know, we can set the things on the chat. And we can set the

08:14.980 --> 08:21.300
things with with that. But we can't change the follow because I would turn on the follow thing.

08:21.300 --> 08:25.940
You know, and I realized that can kind of damage your follow base. But I I'm whatever like I would

08:25.940 --> 08:30.020
turn it on so that you have to have a verified phone number to be able to follow. I don't think

08:30.020 --> 08:33.860
it's that big of a deal that they're asking for. And definitely raid. That's the other thing.

08:33.860 --> 08:38.580
They're not they're not doing anything the actual like hate raid when you get a bunch of these,

08:38.580 --> 08:43.860
you know, hose to suddenly raid and their icons and stuff that are coming through are all

08:43.860 --> 08:51.700
disgusting images that that's not really done yet. But I for what it's worth, I haven't personally

08:51.700 --> 08:56.500
seen it happen to a channel in a little bit. So everything I'm hearing is anecdotal. And I don't

08:56.500 --> 09:01.540
know if it's been happening since and maybe chat. You can set me straight because y'all are or set

09:01.540 --> 09:06.660
me gay, whatever you prefer. But send me in the chat whichever way I should be going over at

09:06.660 --> 09:12.580
twitch.tv slash vogue network on if you've seen one of these in the past couple days or heard

09:12.580 --> 09:16.900
about this happening since Twitch actually did these changes. That's what I would be curious

09:16.900 --> 09:23.220
about. Yeah, I'm fifth dream. Oh, sorry, go ahead. Is that something that you toggle on in your

09:23.220 --> 09:28.660
stream manager? Because I'm not seeing it in mine. It is there. It's kind of you have to go on to

09:28.660 --> 09:36.100
your dashboard settings and moderation and then or mods can do it via chat manage moderation settings.

09:36.100 --> 09:41.380
And then you can toggle the phone or email verification required for all accounts first

09:41.380 --> 09:46.820
time chatters, chatters with the couch is less than and they have like certain criteria up from

09:46.820 --> 09:53.060
one day to six months, or even like one hour chatters following for less than pre filled up,

09:53.060 --> 09:57.860
they have like 10 minutes, 30 minutes, all the way up to three months. So you can add all that.

09:58.580 --> 10:05.220
You can also exempt VIP subscribers and mods and whatnot. I think that's good that they have all

10:05.220 --> 10:12.340
that stuff in there definitely will slow them down. Yeah, but and just some free advice you

10:12.340 --> 10:17.700
didn't ask for for Twitch streamers and up and coming Twitch streamers. Never ever, ever, ever

10:17.700 --> 10:23.700
set your channel to followers only mode, unless it's a result of one of these raids. And it's the

10:23.700 --> 10:28.100
only thing you can do about it. Hopefully these options will make it so that you don't need to do

10:28.100 --> 10:34.660
that. But I would say like setting your it so so obviously, you know, because I don't want to get

10:34.820 --> 10:39.060
the email that's like, you're insensitive and rude, Rob, because you haven't had to deal with

10:39.060 --> 10:42.980
as many of these and I have to turn it on. Okay, yeah, if you're doing it as a response to these,

10:42.980 --> 10:47.460
I'm sorry, you have to do that. Because that is one of the worst things you can do to your channel

10:47.460 --> 10:52.980
to stifle growth, in my opinion. Never turn on followers only mode because you're not encouraging

10:52.980 --> 11:00.180
discussion with new potential awesome people. And then you can't like- Following is free.

11:00.180 --> 11:04.820
Yeah, following is free. Well, yeah, you should follow channels that you're watching. But,

11:04.820 --> 11:07.860
you know, sometimes people want to have a little bit of engagement or whatever it is.

11:08.420 --> 11:14.020
I just think turning on followers only mode, you're putting up a wall and then somebody just,

11:14.020 --> 11:18.020
you know, it's like, I don't want to follow, I'll just go to a different channel. You know,

11:18.020 --> 11:22.740
I'm not that I'm not I'm not that motivated to say something. You want to encourage the

11:22.740 --> 11:29.060
participation as easy as possible. You don't want to make it even one button and an alert,

11:29.060 --> 11:34.260
which some people don't want to have the alerts. I follow channels purposely when they're not live

11:34.260 --> 11:40.420
so that I don't do an alert so that it's just like outside. This is what it is. So-

11:40.420 --> 11:46.100
See, I like when people follow or sub while I can see it so that

11:47.380 --> 11:51.060
I can give them a shout out and thank them. Sure. Not everybody wants to be seen though.

11:52.660 --> 11:56.660
You know, it just depends on the preference of the viewer and so forth.

11:56.660 --> 11:59.940
Yeah, but sometimes it makes the streamer feel good.

11:59.940 --> 12:02.420
Sure. To witness it and know that it's happened.

12:03.380 --> 12:07.940
Let's see. Mike Deft in chat is kind of agreeing, saying, yeah, people do tend to go away

12:08.580 --> 12:14.180
if they see an obstacle, even as simple as just a click. And Mike Deft continues, ads suck more

12:14.180 --> 12:21.060
though. Yeah, I really think that feature that Twitch added where it automatically plays ads.

12:21.060 --> 12:25.060
I mean, if you're dropping an ad because you're going to pee anyway and you're not going to be

12:25.060 --> 12:29.780
there for two minutes, that's one thing. But the one that like I've been to channels now that just

12:29.780 --> 12:35.140
automatically play the ads every 30 minutes. And it's so like I tune right out. Like if I feel

12:35.140 --> 12:38.500
like they're talking and I'm missing something, I forget it. I'll just go somewhere else.

12:40.020 --> 12:44.340
But I won't like if somebody's like it because I've done it. I've run an ad when I've gotten up

12:44.340 --> 12:48.580
to pee because I know nothing's going to happen on my channel for two minutes, but an AFK screen.

12:48.580 --> 12:52.020
So it's like, all right, whatever. I'm not like hurting anything or stifling discussion.

12:52.580 --> 12:57.140
So and I'm getting rid of pre-roll ads, which is another important thing. So,

12:58.820 --> 13:05.380
well, I actually do that when when I go for one of my many bathroom breaks, I usually run an ad.

13:05.380 --> 13:11.060
Sure. But that makes sense to do it. And make two whole cents. Yeah. Let's see,

13:11.060 --> 13:16.020
Zen Monkey 11 in chat says they should have a hide button for subs so they can choose to be seen or

13:16.020 --> 13:21.620
not. You know, technically that exists because you only actually push the sub notice through

13:21.620 --> 13:25.620
when you check that bot. And some people have said, Rob, why don't you why didn't you read

13:25.620 --> 13:29.620
my shout out at the end of the stream? I didn't see it. You didn't you didn't let that little

13:29.620 --> 13:36.660
chat thing go through to put a gun to your head to announce it in chat. Like every time I like

13:36.660 --> 13:42.100
close, close, close. No, listen, you do it. You're going to announce your subscription. Yeah,

13:42.100 --> 13:46.740
that's the other thing is I'm like, how did you get that to go away? Because I never can.

13:47.620 --> 13:52.580
No, it's crazy. Yeah, it's like, it's like, sorry, you can't do anything until you announce your sub.

13:52.580 --> 14:01.300
It's like, okay, thanks. Bonds 006 in chat says I followed 26 channels lurk in 22 of them. I'm

14:01.300 --> 14:07.300
tuning in to give the person the numbers. I literally lurk in 90% of dark soccer's DVD games.

14:07.300 --> 14:11.140
Not to speak for dark soccer when she's right there, but I'm gonna guess she doesn't mind if

14:11.140 --> 14:16.900
you lurk because it's still a view. So yeah, yeah. So and because that's how I feel too.

14:16.900 --> 14:24.180
And again, view numbers are weird anyway. Like I it'll say three people are watching and then

14:24.180 --> 14:30.660
it's got like 50 people lurking. Yeah, that's why that's why I just learned to stop looking

14:30.660 --> 14:36.420
at those numbers like because they're not right half the time anyway. But I would also say a

14:36.420 --> 14:40.980
really big no no as a streamer. Do not shout out random people in chat that you know are there.

14:41.540 --> 14:47.620
Like, there are very specific circumstances that might be okay. Like, for example, like, you know,

14:47.620 --> 14:52.340
oh, we're gonna bring up Pokemon is Shane in chat. Let me look at the chat list. Oh,

14:52.340 --> 14:57.060
that's different. Because, you know, we've been friends for years and you know, whatever,

14:57.060 --> 15:01.300
he knows I'm going to call him out. If I ever bring up a Pokemon topic, and that's a compliment.

15:01.300 --> 15:05.860
But again, sometimes people just want to lurk, they just want to idle and they don't necessarily

15:05.860 --> 15:09.940
want to participate. They just are having the content in the background. So to call them out

15:09.940 --> 15:16.340
can always feel really awkward. So anyway, all right. Um, anyway, this was not unsolicited Twitch

15:16.340 --> 15:22.180
advice hour, it was responding to some of these news items. But I think there's more right, Loki?

15:22.180 --> 15:24.500
Well, it did help me out, by the way. Thanks. Thanks, Loki.

15:25.460 --> 15:32.500
So there is also more and this is kind of, I don't necessarily like where this is going,

15:32.500 --> 15:39.300
but it's basically this new service that they're testing right now. It's called boosting.

15:39.300 --> 15:48.980
And what it basically does is allows you to pay for recommendations to other people. So for

15:48.980 --> 15:55.620
example, they have like a screenshot here showing that they're paying about 297 for 3000

15:55.620 --> 16:01.700
recommendations. So I guess it blasted out to it pops maybe your channel on their recommended

16:01.700 --> 16:08.500
feed on the side there. I'm not really sure what that's about. But yeah, apparently it varies in

16:08.500 --> 16:14.980
cost depending on how many recommendations you're looking to Facebook does that.

16:17.140 --> 16:22.580
I don't necessarily like that. That's kind of pay to win at that point. But I don't know.

16:23.380 --> 16:27.300
I think that's exactly what Facebook does for your for personal pages.

16:27.860 --> 16:32.740
The response on Twitter has been very interesting to this because I've seen a lot of streamer pals

16:32.740 --> 16:37.780
and friends that are tweeting like, if you are a fan of my stream, please do not do this.

16:39.300 --> 16:45.460
I'm not so sure I'm apt to tell people not to do this. Because at the end of the day,

16:46.020 --> 16:50.340
it's your money, spend it how you want. If you're going to spend money on a mediocre way

16:50.340 --> 16:55.300
to boost the visibility of VOG Network or one of our personal streams, of course, I'm not going to

16:55.300 --> 17:02.500
stop you. Like, maybe it'll work. Yay, who knows? But I think there's just a lot of us going, we

17:02.500 --> 17:06.980
don't get a cut of that. And so there's a lot of us going, the money would be better spent on a sub

17:06.980 --> 17:12.580
or biddies because we actually get some of that money. And we'll spend it on advertising in other

17:12.580 --> 17:17.860
ways like buying a booth at a convention where we can talk to people face to face or getting more

17:17.860 --> 17:23.620
flyers or merchandise made that we can take to conventions and other live spaces. I think that

17:23.620 --> 17:30.180
is kind of why people are urging people to go the other direction with this. It would be nice maybe

17:30.180 --> 17:36.100
if Twitch had a boost slash, you know, donate or tip the streamer type of thing. And then maybe

17:36.100 --> 17:42.020
people wouldn't feel so opposed. But again, I'm not going to take a hard line on that. If you feel

17:42.020 --> 17:47.460
generous enough to boost VOG Network, again, I don't think it's the best way you could spend the

17:47.460 --> 17:54.100
money. But I'll be curious if it works. And I'll be thankful that you tried, I guess. So that's

17:54.100 --> 18:01.860
how I kind of feel. Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, that's why I don't like the Discord Nitro system.

18:01.860 --> 18:07.540
Just let us pay to get the boosted perks instead of forcing our users to do so. Yeah, I'm not a

18:07.540 --> 18:12.660
huge, huge fan of that either. But I do like that a server can be boosted a pretty decent amount

18:12.660 --> 18:19.700
with just one person. And so the VOG Network Discord is boosted thanks to yours truly. I think

18:19.700 --> 18:25.060
somebody else actually boosted so I can't take all the credit anymore. But maybe Bobby did it too,

18:25.060 --> 18:31.620
actually. But yeah, I mean, I was the first I know that that got us boosted there. So I mean,

18:31.620 --> 18:36.740
it's gonna take like 50 boosts to get to the next level. Yeah, don't do that. Don't don't spend the

18:36.740 --> 18:41.700
money to do that. Like yeah, I agree with Bobby. Let us pay to do it. And maybe we will. Who knows?

18:42.260 --> 18:46.340
Yeah, Mike Deff says I'd rather give you guys the money directly. Thank you. We'll take it.

18:46.340 --> 18:51.300
Although remember, we don't ask for money to do this show. Like all the tips and things you guys

18:51.300 --> 18:55.940
give. And I did notice the hype train earlier. Thank you guys very much for that. You really,

18:55.940 --> 19:01.460
really don't have to do those types of things. But since you did, we'll use the money to keep

19:01.460 --> 19:05.540
our business legitimate and to help spread the word and try to grow our family a little bit.

19:06.340 --> 19:09.300
And, you know, it'll be nice when conventions come back and we can do that more.

19:09.300 --> 19:13.860
Dude, no more selling the black market knockoff video games?

19:15.460 --> 19:18.420
Well, that's kind of what Loki's doing with Pixel Poops.

19:18.420 --> 19:21.780
Yeah, but that's a legit game.

19:21.780 --> 19:22.280
It is.

19:23.380 --> 19:27.380
I mean, like, you know, 50 million in one cartridges.

19:28.420 --> 19:30.260
Yeah. Oh yeah, those. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

19:30.260 --> 19:32.020
Selling them out of the boot of my Fiat.

19:33.940 --> 19:39.140
So yeah, again, the boosting thing is interesting. I'm not sure it's going to have much success,

19:39.140 --> 19:43.780
but I think it just also shows like, I don't know a nice way to put this,

19:43.780 --> 19:48.020
so I'm just going to say it bluntly. It shows how desperate Twitch is to make money right now.

19:48.420 --> 19:54.740
Is that they're allowing the content creators to essentially buy advertisements.

19:54.740 --> 19:56.900
Do you know what I would be interested in buying?

19:56.900 --> 20:00.180
Hey, Twitch, hey, let me give you some advice. You didn't ask for it.

20:00.180 --> 20:04.660
Here's what I would be interested in buying, provided it's priced reasonably,

20:04.660 --> 20:06.900
perhaps for my own channel, perhaps for other channels.

20:06.900 --> 20:11.220
I would be interested in buying something that removes the ads from my channel for everybody.

20:12.500 --> 20:15.940
There's no more ads on my channel and maybe I'll pay like whatever,

20:16.180 --> 20:19.540
15 bucks a month, whatever, you know, you want to set.

20:19.540 --> 20:21.300
I'll pay it to get rid of ads completely.

20:22.660 --> 20:27.460
But I'm tired of having to pay that much in all of the people I'm subbed to.

20:27.460 --> 20:28.100
Oh, right.

20:28.100 --> 20:29.620
And I'm subbed to a lot of people.

20:29.620 --> 20:34.100
I was going to say, I see you in a lot of channels.

20:34.100 --> 20:36.660
Well, no, I can be in a lot of chats and follow them.

20:36.660 --> 20:38.180
I'm talking about the subs I have.

20:38.180 --> 20:39.860
I see you subbing to a lot of channels.

20:40.580 --> 20:44.980
And I need to apologize to those friends and take a step back.

20:45.620 --> 20:46.100
I don't.

20:46.100 --> 20:48.100
You know, I don't think you need to apologize to anybody.

20:48.740 --> 20:55.540
And no one, no one should expect a sub from anyone, because that's when

20:56.340 --> 20:57.300
you should all sub to me.

20:57.300 --> 20:58.900
I'm kidding, kidding, kidding.

20:58.900 --> 21:03.380
That's when Twitch turns into a pyramid scheme, basically.

21:03.380 --> 21:07.460
And this was this was the exact same criticism I had a Patreon for.

21:07.460 --> 21:13.220
And I in some ways I still do is that there is a social pressure

21:13.780 --> 21:18.020
that if I donate to this Patreon, you need to donate to my Patreon.

21:18.020 --> 21:19.140
So what are we doing?

21:19.140 --> 21:22.340
We're giving each other money and letting Patreon take a cut of it.

21:22.340 --> 21:24.740
That is the exact same thing that happens

21:24.740 --> 21:29.140
when Twitch people feel a requirement to sub to each other's channels.

21:29.140 --> 21:32.100
All you're doing is amazoning Twitch.

21:32.100 --> 21:32.660
Yeah.

21:32.660 --> 21:36.020
It's basically the whole thing is Amazon's scheme right there.

21:36.580 --> 21:37.380
It's an MLM.

21:38.260 --> 21:39.940
Is what Bond's 006 says.

21:40.020 --> 21:48.580
Anyway, Bobby Blackwoven chat says, I thought Twitch turbo removes ads used to be prime gaming

21:48.580 --> 21:51.860
used to be that way until it will on one channel.

21:52.900 --> 21:55.540
The one that you're subscribed to with your free subscription.

21:55.540 --> 22:00.580
But other than that, yeah, you can just tell that Twitch is desperate to make money.

22:01.300 --> 22:03.620
And I don't know.

22:03.620 --> 22:05.780
There's a part of me that's starting to worry.

22:05.780 --> 22:11.300
I'm going to be honest that Twitch, Amazon may think about cutting Twitch off at some

22:11.300 --> 22:13.060
point if they're not making enough money.

22:13.060 --> 22:13.560
I don't know.

22:15.620 --> 22:21.700
So anyway, on that happy friendly note, let's move on to our gaming weeks and we're going

22:21.700 --> 22:24.660
to talk about the types of video games that we have been playing this.

22:24.660 --> 22:29.220
Oh, Bobby Blackwoven says Twitch turbo still gives you an ad free viewing across Twitch.

22:29.220 --> 22:30.580
I didn't even know that was a thing.

22:30.580 --> 22:31.220
I thought that.

22:31.220 --> 22:33.300
Yeah, I thought that went away with prime gaming.

22:34.020 --> 22:35.700
Let Loki go first, by the way.

22:35.700 --> 22:36.200
What's that?

22:38.020 --> 22:39.700
Let Loki go first so I can finish chewing.

22:40.740 --> 22:44.180
Okay, let me go to Loki and talk about gaming weeks.

22:44.180 --> 22:45.380
Loki, how was your gaming week?

22:46.020 --> 22:51.460
Yeah, so I played Minecraft and I was doing video editing for that as well.

22:51.460 --> 22:55.780
Still, I'm actually I was going through time lapses because I broke my time lapse up into

22:55.780 --> 23:00.580
about 12 parts because I had like several different sessions that I built stuff in.

23:01.380 --> 23:04.740
So I'm actually thinking about just cutting out the time lapse because it's not that interesting

23:04.740 --> 23:05.220
anyways.

23:05.220 --> 23:06.740
And then that'll save me a whole bunch of time.

23:06.740 --> 23:11.460
I put my episode out, which should have been out last week, but, you know, took longer

23:11.460 --> 23:13.540
than anticipated, as usual.

23:14.660 --> 23:19.540
And then, of course, I played more power washing sim.

23:19.540 --> 23:29.940
So now I'm all the way through like I'm on the Hansel and Gretel cottage thing, which

23:30.020 --> 23:30.980
is interesting.

23:30.980 --> 23:34.420
And then I just finished up the skate park, which is pretty big.

23:36.100 --> 23:40.180
I just bought the the the best power washer in the game.

23:40.180 --> 23:44.980
And yeah, it's it's still something I keep playing.

23:44.980 --> 23:46.340
It's a good, good.

23:46.340 --> 23:48.100
I don't want to think about anything.

23:48.100 --> 23:54.340
Just let my mind go to mush game where you just power wash.

23:54.340 --> 23:59.060
And I didn't realize that like the R key actually rotates the power washer adapter, which I

23:59.060 --> 24:02.420
wish I had figured that out at the beginning, because I know like on the keys, they have

24:02.420 --> 24:05.860
it mapped to like X and C is supposed to like rotate through stuff.

24:05.860 --> 24:11.300
But I thought that actually would like rotate your sprayer, but it never seemed to do that.

24:11.300 --> 24:13.620
But yeah, R does that apparently.

24:13.620 --> 24:14.180
And so that.

24:14.180 --> 24:14.820
Oh, my God.

24:14.820 --> 24:15.300
Noted.

24:15.300 --> 24:18.580
I was trying to use that today and I'm like, I thought Z and X was supposed to rotate the

24:18.580 --> 24:18.980
gun.

24:18.980 --> 24:19.220
Yeah.

24:19.220 --> 24:20.900
So it's R R does.

24:20.900 --> 24:22.900
Yeah, it'll rotate at 90 degrees.

24:22.900 --> 24:30.900
So it's yeah, that helped me out a lot with, you know, being able to spray in different

24:30.900 --> 24:31.860
directions and stuff.

24:31.860 --> 24:33.060
So, yep.

24:34.980 --> 24:35.700
So that's it.

24:35.700 --> 24:37.060
That's what I played this week.

24:37.060 --> 24:37.540
All right.

24:37.540 --> 24:38.740
Let's see if our soccer is ready.

24:38.740 --> 24:40.020
Your gaming week, our soccer.

24:40.020 --> 24:46.180
Um, I picked up a couple of games for a certain somebody in my house's upcoming birthday on

24:46.180 --> 24:46.980
the following month.

24:47.780 --> 24:51.540
Um, I will not say what they are in case he is listening.

24:52.260 --> 24:56.500
Um, I bought a game and ended up getting a different game.

24:56.500 --> 24:58.180
And then the person sent me the right game.

24:58.180 --> 25:02.020
So this is the game I ordered, which is peel peel for Super Famicom.

25:03.140 --> 25:06.260
I also got sent, um, puzzle day pawn.

25:07.060 --> 25:11.300
So yeah, first for the podcast, folks, she's holding up the cartridges.

25:11.300 --> 25:13.060
So she's this is a show and tell.

25:13.700 --> 25:17.460
I mean, really, I was only out four bucks in general, but the person was really nice

25:17.460 --> 25:19.300
about it and they get some good games in.

25:19.300 --> 25:22.500
So, um, but it was like through Makari or something.

25:22.500 --> 25:24.260
Um, it's a puzzle upon.

25:24.260 --> 25:26.900
That was the one that was on the Neo Geo as well.

25:28.020 --> 25:32.420
Um, or is that different games on his Tetris attack and Pokemon Puzzle League, right?

25:33.140 --> 25:33.460
Yeah.

25:33.460 --> 25:34.100
Yeah.

25:34.100 --> 25:34.820
Okay.

25:34.820 --> 25:34.980
Yeah.

25:35.860 --> 25:36.580
I'm not mad.

25:36.580 --> 25:37.860
Puzzle day pawn is fun.

25:37.860 --> 25:38.500
Yeah, yeah, it is.

25:39.220 --> 25:39.380
Yeah.

25:39.380 --> 25:42.500
Cause they have a game called puzzle day pawn on the Neo Geo.

25:42.500 --> 25:44.260
That was like bust a move.

25:44.260 --> 25:46.660
So, uh, I used to, I used to play it.

25:47.300 --> 25:48.100
Tunnel day pawn.

25:49.220 --> 25:51.940
No, they call it puzzle the pawn in, on the Neo Geo.

25:51.940 --> 25:55.140
I know it's should be like paneled upon, but it's puzzled upon.

25:55.140 --> 25:58.740
I, I promise you, I played it all the time when I worked at round table.

25:58.740 --> 26:01.140
That's one of the four Neo Geo games that we had.

26:02.340 --> 26:03.620
Mandela effect in action.

26:04.340 --> 26:06.260
It is not the Mandela effect in action.

26:06.260 --> 26:07.780
I guarantee it is.

26:07.780 --> 26:08.100
Okay.

26:08.100 --> 26:08.980
Puzzle day pawn.

26:08.980 --> 26:13.460
Maybe that might've been the name for us distribution.

26:15.220 --> 26:15.940
No, it's right here.

26:16.260 --> 26:18.580
SNK and Taito puzzle day pawn.

26:19.780 --> 26:21.220
I am not insane.

26:21.220 --> 26:21.620
All right.

26:21.620 --> 26:22.660
Bob and Bobby.

26:22.660 --> 26:23.540
Bobby's confirming.

26:23.540 --> 26:24.660
He Googled it.

26:24.660 --> 26:25.140
You're right.

26:25.780 --> 26:26.180
All right.

26:26.180 --> 26:26.580
All right.

26:26.580 --> 26:26.980
All right.

26:26.980 --> 26:27.300
Chat.

26:28.260 --> 26:29.460
Chat says, Loki's right.

26:29.460 --> 26:29.780
Fine.

26:30.340 --> 26:30.660
Come on.

26:30.660 --> 26:31.860
We were trying to gaslight him.

26:31.860 --> 26:34.020
You guys let us have fun.

26:34.020 --> 26:34.580
I'm just kidding.

26:34.580 --> 26:36.660
I, I really did that.

26:36.660 --> 26:37.940
Maybe I'm the one.

26:37.940 --> 26:39.460
Wasn't Nintendo published.

26:41.940 --> 26:43.300
So interesting.

26:44.020 --> 26:45.300
Puyo Puyo was Bonpresto.

26:46.180 --> 26:46.500
Anyway.

26:47.620 --> 26:52.980
Um, so there's that, um, I've also been watching a lot of people play new world.

26:52.980 --> 26:59.940
And if I figured out, I can't, it will not run on a windows arm, which is the version

26:59.940 --> 27:01.380
I have to run in parallels.

27:01.380 --> 27:08.260
So I can't do it unless I install one of those, uh, uh, motherboards in my old PC,

27:08.260 --> 27:13.540
uh, whenever I can get some time to and upgrade my graphics card and get a better hard drive.

27:13.540 --> 27:18.820
Cause it's, it's kind of just like, oh, I don't want to do anything.

27:18.820 --> 27:21.140
And then that way I'll leave it on steam link it.

27:21.140 --> 27:22.100
And I'm fine.

27:22.100 --> 27:22.600
Yeah.

27:22.980 --> 27:29.380
I have been able to steam link a lot of stuff, honestly enough through, uh, my, uh, windows

27:29.380 --> 27:29.880
arm.

27:30.580 --> 27:34.340
So like whenever I want to use, uh, like source filmmaker.

27:35.220 --> 27:41.620
I I'm playing, I'm doing it like in my Mac build, but it's streaming from my little,

27:41.620 --> 27:43.940
you know, virtual windows.

27:43.940 --> 27:44.980
So weird.

27:45.700 --> 27:52.420
Um, I'm also, uh, um, I am playing a lot of dead by daylight.

27:52.420 --> 27:59.300
Uh, I played a lot of dead by daylight, um, when I did that marathon and I'm doing another

27:59.300 --> 28:04.740
marathon, 14 hours of dead by daylight, 13 hours, 13 hours, lucky 13, because I had to

28:04.740 --> 28:06.500
be stubborn and make it one more hour.

28:06.500 --> 28:08.420
And then I'm like, okay, I can't do this anymore.

28:09.300 --> 28:17.300
What I have learned from this, no one plays dead by daylight at 4 AM or five or six, just

28:17.300 --> 28:17.800
saying.

28:18.340 --> 28:26.420
Um, my next one is going to be, uh, for, uh, well, I've mentioned my, my lesbian moms,

28:26.420 --> 28:26.920
right?

28:27.300 --> 28:28.420
A while ago on the show.

28:28.420 --> 28:32.340
It's been some time, but I know this just from knowing you for so long.

28:32.340 --> 28:35.940
I'm not sure every listener's heard this of these individuals before.

28:36.820 --> 28:43.300
When I had just started college, um, I was taken in by some very dear friends of mine.

28:43.940 --> 28:50.340
Um, and I always refer to them as my mama son and my papa son, um, not to be confused

28:50.340 --> 28:56.900
with furniture, but, um, they, they really took good care of me at a time when I desperately

28:56.900 --> 28:57.540
needed it.

28:57.540 --> 29:04.340
And I was in a really, really bad spot, just, you know, mentally, I was unmedicated and

29:04.340 --> 29:05.940
didn't know I was autistic at the time.

29:06.580 --> 29:08.900
Um, so they took me in, they took care of me.

29:08.900 --> 29:11.700
They've been there for me for some pretty major stuff.

29:11.700 --> 29:14.580
They're actually the people who introduced me to Dan.

29:15.380 --> 29:23.940
So, um, funny enough, uh, back in the day, um, my, uh, Dan's old AOL screen name was

29:23.940 --> 29:32.660
dark ryoga and, uh, uh, and, uh, uh, papa son had a ryoga screen name as well.

29:33.460 --> 29:36.020
And then I, mine was dark Uchon.

29:36.020 --> 29:39.380
So it was pretty, pretty funny.

29:39.380 --> 29:42.660
Um, and by the way, people don't whisper me during this show, please.

29:42.660 --> 29:51.060
Um, it was just really funny that, um, that I met Dan that way and I had actually met

29:51.060 --> 29:52.500
my friend Julie before that.

29:53.060 --> 29:58.340
Um, in the sailor moon AOL chat room, but, uh, I didn't know that Julie and Dan were

29:58.340 --> 29:59.220
friends at the time.

29:59.220 --> 30:05.140
So, but anyway, um, so, you know, I moved to California every time I'd go back, I'd

30:05.140 --> 30:07.300
have to go see them and hang out with them.

30:07.300 --> 30:15.220
And so, uh, to put things forward now, um, uh, papa son has been, uh, recently diagnosed

30:15.220 --> 30:17.060
with cancer, like a few days ago.

30:17.780 --> 30:25.060
Um, had, I also heard that she had her first, uh, chemo treatment today and is feeling pretty

30:25.060 --> 30:25.860
beat up by it.

30:26.740 --> 30:34.180
Um, and, uh, I want to do something to give back to them.

30:34.180 --> 30:39.140
I don't really have like a whole lot of bonus money right now.

30:39.140 --> 30:42.980
Um, which is why I'm trying to, you know, dial back my Twitch stuff.

30:43.700 --> 30:49.220
Um, but I figured I do have kind of have an audience, you know, I get people in from time

30:49.220 --> 30:53.620
to time and I'm pretty good at making friends and I have friends who would support me in

30:53.620 --> 30:53.860
this.

30:54.500 --> 31:02.180
So, um, I'm doing another marathon, um, not tomorrow, Monday, but next Monday on the 11th.

31:02.180 --> 31:03.860
Um, I'll link stuff in the chat room.

31:03.860 --> 31:05.700
I would greatly appreciate some support.

31:05.700 --> 31:12.900
I'm doing it from 11 AM to 11 PM Pacific time, um, which I figured would accommodate our

31:12.900 --> 31:17.380
West coast and East coast and maybe some of our Australian people.

31:17.380 --> 31:24.420
Cause that would be going into the, the late afternoon for them and maybe some of our UK

31:24.420 --> 31:26.900
people earlier in the day, you know, get them in the evening.

31:26.900 --> 31:28.180
Probably going to work out at some other time.

31:28.180 --> 31:28.420
Yeah.

31:29.060 --> 31:29.540
Yeah.

31:29.540 --> 31:32.980
Um, and it also means I still don't have to get up before 10 AM, so that's good.

31:33.620 --> 31:40.820
Um, but, uh, I really want to give back to Barbara.

31:40.820 --> 31:44.260
Barbara has been an amazing, just an amazing human being in general.

31:44.980 --> 31:50.180
Um, a delight, delightful human, uh, has always taken good care of my mom and son.

31:50.180 --> 31:55.620
They take good care of each other and just one of my absolute dearest friends, my chosen

31:55.620 --> 31:56.020
family.

31:56.660 --> 32:00.420
And I mean that in the truest sense of chosen family.

32:01.700 --> 32:05.780
So I would appreciate if everyone would help me.

32:05.780 --> 32:09.220
Well, let me know how I can help besides just, um, trying to get the word out.

32:09.220 --> 32:11.460
So, um, you know, if you want, there is a GoFundMe.

32:12.100 --> 32:12.580
Okay.

32:12.580 --> 32:20.020
And I'll put the links for that in there, but I will say that if you, um, for friends

32:20.020 --> 32:28.820
who donate before the marathon, your amount, your donations will count toward the, the

32:28.820 --> 32:29.380
giveaways.

32:30.340 --> 32:35.540
So, um, I will make sure that that information gets, uh, LinkedIn chat.

32:35.540 --> 32:38.660
Cause you know, y'all, y'all have all helped me.

32:38.660 --> 32:40.740
People in the community have been really great to me.

32:41.460 --> 32:46.340
And, uh, I want to, I also want to provide some entertainment in the form of me complaining

32:46.340 --> 32:47.140
about survivors.

32:48.340 --> 32:48.660
All right.

32:48.660 --> 32:50.820
There is a $5,000 goal.

32:50.820 --> 32:54.100
If I can hit $5,000, I will play survivor.

32:54.820 --> 32:55.300
All right.

32:55.860 --> 32:56.980
I'll be in a Swift with y'all.

32:56.980 --> 32:59.140
That's a big goal, but it's a good, it's a good cause.

32:59.140 --> 33:02.020
Like if you're going to raise $5,000 for anything, this is the reason.

33:02.020 --> 33:04.180
And I might lower that to three.

33:04.820 --> 33:05.220
All right.

33:05.780 --> 33:11.940
Well, anything else for your gaming week, dark saga?

33:12.820 --> 33:16.580
Um, a little bit of pinball, played some pinball world cup.

33:17.380 --> 33:22.900
Um, harass the cat, harass the cat is my favorite game.

33:22.900 --> 33:23.400
Really.

33:24.100 --> 33:26.260
Is it you harassing the cat or the cat harassing you?

33:26.900 --> 33:28.020
I don't know what her deal is.

33:28.020 --> 33:29.140
Maybe she's just getting old.

33:29.140 --> 33:34.340
Cause she's going to be 10, um, around my birthday, but she's just been like, I'm going

33:34.340 --> 33:39.140
to sit in your lap and then she'll do like the flat cat thing, you know, where she just

33:39.140 --> 33:40.340
turns into a pancake.

33:41.300 --> 33:41.620
Yes.

33:41.620 --> 33:43.940
And then I'll just pet and purr pet and purr.

33:45.060 --> 33:48.900
And then she's like, she fucks off into the night as cat.

33:48.900 --> 33:50.740
By the way, I haven't, I have any mascot.

33:51.940 --> 33:53.060
The ferret is no more.

33:54.260 --> 33:54.500
Yeah.

33:54.500 --> 33:55.940
I have the iridescent platypus.

33:55.940 --> 33:56.900
The iridescent plat.

33:56.900 --> 33:57.300
That's good.

33:57.300 --> 34:00.180
Cause I'm like, I don't even know where those ferret things are anymore.

34:00.180 --> 34:01.540
I'm many of them.

34:02.660 --> 34:03.140
All right.

34:03.140 --> 34:05.300
The original ferret is in my possession.

34:06.100 --> 34:06.740
Oh, well that's good.

34:06.740 --> 34:09.540
I'm glad, glad it's, uh, got a good home.

34:10.260 --> 34:13.700
There was a couple on the cotton, or I think there was like one at least on the Katamari

34:13.700 --> 34:14.660
that Namco had.

34:14.660 --> 34:15.160
Yes.

34:15.860 --> 34:18.420
One of them got placed on a Katamari ball at E3.

34:18.420 --> 34:21.620
I do remember that it was, it was sacrificed to the Katamari gods.

34:22.500 --> 34:24.340
Uh, orange right in chat.

34:24.340 --> 34:26.260
The last ferret is in captivity.

34:26.260 --> 34:27.780
The galaxy is at peace.

34:30.660 --> 34:31.780
Gold star comment of the week.

34:31.780 --> 34:32.180
All right.

34:32.980 --> 34:33.380
Let's see.

34:33.380 --> 34:36.580
Uh, I want to address this too, before we get to my gaming week, uh, along the lines

34:36.580 --> 34:38.500
of, of dead by daylight.

34:38.500 --> 34:43.860
She-Hulk Tandon chat says I have been playing tons of Friday, the 13th, the game, awesome

34:43.860 --> 34:46.340
horror, fun, highly underrated.

34:46.340 --> 34:49.380
You know, that game kind of came and went and what's interesting.

34:49.380 --> 34:54.100
That game came out right around the time dead by daylight did, uh, in fact, I believe Friday

34:54.100 --> 34:56.900
the 13th came out a few months before it was first.

34:56.900 --> 34:58.420
I think it was first.

34:58.420 --> 35:03.140
Um, and, uh, it's, but it's the same idea four versus one and it's survivors and killer,

35:03.140 --> 35:05.300
but the killer in this case is Jason.

35:05.300 --> 35:08.660
But, and they gave away that game on PlayStation plus for a hot minute too.

35:08.660 --> 35:09.300
Anyway.

35:09.300 --> 35:11.460
Um, yeah, it's, it's a really fun game.

35:11.460 --> 35:17.300
The only problem is that the game got kind of fucked over by all the legal problems that

35:17.300 --> 35:20.180
have been going on around the Friday the 13th franchise.

35:20.180 --> 35:24.180
And I believe in related note, that was all figured out this week.

35:24.180 --> 35:29.380
I was seeing something about like that the guy who wrote Friday the 13th ended up, he

35:29.380 --> 35:33.380
does have the rights because he wrote the movie as a contractor or something like that.

35:33.380 --> 35:33.860
I don't know.

35:33.860 --> 35:39.300
So, so, but legally there's probably a lot of ground still to cover, but, um, yeah, I

35:39.300 --> 35:40.980
mean the Friday the 13th game was great.

35:40.980 --> 35:45.940
Um, but it just, it couldn't go really much further than where it went because of all

35:45.940 --> 35:46.740
the legal problems.

35:46.740 --> 35:49.460
Like it really got screwed by these outside legal problems.

35:49.460 --> 35:51.700
So that's really unfortunate.

35:51.700 --> 35:51.940
Yeah.

35:51.940 --> 35:53.380
It was as of yesterday.

35:53.380 --> 35:55.620
So she'll 10 says, Oh, nine versus one.

35:55.620 --> 35:56.980
I always thought it was four V one.

35:56.980 --> 35:58.980
I didn't realize they expanded it later on.

35:58.980 --> 36:00.100
That's kind of cool.

36:00.100 --> 36:06.500
Um, so yeah, so now people are wondering, Oh, does this lawsuit mean that now dead by

36:06.500 --> 36:10.020
daylight could get Jason and I settled down.

36:10.020 --> 36:11.700
It could have happened anyway.

36:11.700 --> 36:12.020
Yeah.

36:12.020 --> 36:14.500
Just, and just in general, settle down.

36:14.500 --> 36:18.100
Like there's, there's, we already have Myers and Freddie.

36:18.100 --> 36:20.980
There still is the Friday the 13th game.

36:20.980 --> 36:25.700
Uh, you know, I, I would say they tried to get that going again before suddenly adding

36:25.700 --> 36:28.020
Jason to dead by daylight, but I don't know.

36:28.020 --> 36:31.780
Nothing's impossible in this day and age, but I, I just wouldn't, I wouldn't, uh.

36:31.780 --> 36:34.500
Well, and now we have, um, the Cenobite.

36:35.300 --> 36:37.380
We have the hell king, the hell priest.

36:37.380 --> 36:41.940
I mean, it really is as, as you've described it before, it really is the Avengers of horror

36:41.940 --> 36:42.580
in that game.

36:43.140 --> 36:44.820
We need candy man next.

36:44.820 --> 36:45.940
We do need candy, ma'am.

36:45.940 --> 36:46.420
That'd be awesome.

36:46.420 --> 36:46.980
Pumpkin head.

36:47.700 --> 36:48.580
All right.

36:48.660 --> 36:54.260
Anyway, that's another, uh, big one.

36:54.900 --> 36:57.300
Well, we need the real ghost face.

36:57.300 --> 37:01.060
And a lot of dead by daylight players make this mistake is that they assume the ghost

37:01.060 --> 37:02.500
faced as a scream license.

37:02.500 --> 37:06.420
And they're always like, well, why don't we have, you know, Neve Campbell or, or whatever

37:06.420 --> 37:07.540
as a survivor?

37:07.540 --> 37:12.500
Well, have you ever noticed when you read the bio ghost face is not the ghost face.

37:12.500 --> 37:14.420
It's just a completely made up character.

37:14.420 --> 37:18.420
They, because they licensed trailer was hilarious.

37:18.900 --> 37:21.060
But again, had nothing to do with scream.

37:21.060 --> 37:23.060
They licensed the mask.

37:23.060 --> 37:24.420
That's what they licensed.

37:24.420 --> 37:26.020
They didn't license anything with scream.

37:26.020 --> 37:31.700
Scream had to license the mask when it ended up becoming such a huge thing in that game.

37:31.700 --> 37:33.300
She hold 10 says jaws.

37:36.660 --> 37:42.740
So by the way, I have to ask real quick and this'll be the last thing for dead by daylight

37:42.740 --> 37:43.380
for right now.

37:43.380 --> 37:43.700
All right.

37:44.260 --> 37:45.540
What do you think of barista witch?

37:46.500 --> 37:50.420
Oh, Oh, um, I, I hope this, I can't do the PTB.

37:50.420 --> 37:54.180
I hope this doesn't offend, but I think I've actually heard this come out of your mouth.

37:54.180 --> 37:55.620
Um, she, she looks like you.

37:56.500 --> 38:04.180
Yeah, I am the barista, which looks like you like maybe like in a hot topic phase.

38:04.180 --> 38:12.980
If I was really skinny, you know, but she's got red curly hair, wears glasses, um, is

38:12.980 --> 38:14.980
into new agey stuff.

38:16.100 --> 38:16.660
Hello.

38:16.660 --> 38:17.300
Is a witch.

38:18.420 --> 38:19.940
Like storytelling.

38:19.940 --> 38:20.180
Yeah.

38:20.900 --> 38:23.940
Loves books and likes spooky shit.

38:24.660 --> 38:25.860
Oh yeah, no, she's you.

38:25.860 --> 38:26.420
She really is.

38:26.420 --> 38:30.340
She's also the first survivor to be taken in front of a crowd of people.

38:33.220 --> 38:37.620
So me entity is getting pretty ballsy.

38:37.620 --> 38:42.420
By the way, I finally faced a survivor named Vinnie entity.

38:42.420 --> 38:43.780
I can die happy.

38:43.780 --> 38:44.280
All right.

38:44.660 --> 38:48.580
Uh, by just the chat is, uh, giving suggestions.

38:48.580 --> 38:50.020
Uh, and I like the SSJ 100.

38:50.020 --> 38:51.380
Matt says the Babadook.

38:51.380 --> 38:52.980
That's a good suggestion.

38:52.980 --> 38:55.780
Uh, they should add, uh, the Babadook for gay pride month.

38:55.780 --> 38:58.260
Um, Bon Stobel six says a creature from the film.

38:58.260 --> 39:00.580
The mist dark Tetsuya says Chucky.

39:00.580 --> 39:02.500
That's a great, that's a great idea.

39:02.500 --> 39:06.740
Uh, our voiceover friend, Jason, what's your face?

39:07.300 --> 39:10.580
Uh, VX chase XV says, how about the Hocus Pocus witches?

39:10.580 --> 39:12.420
They're not, that's, that's more Disney horror.

39:12.420 --> 39:13.220
They're not scary.

39:13.860 --> 39:14.100
Yeah.

39:14.100 --> 39:16.100
You can't mix Disney horror with dead by daylight.

39:16.100 --> 39:17.620
Unfortunately, believe it or not.

39:17.620 --> 39:20.740
I got into a sort of debate with polyester on Twitter.

39:20.740 --> 39:21.240
Yeah.

39:21.620 --> 39:26.180
Who's like one, one of the big streamer folks, um, has that in with behavior.

39:26.820 --> 39:33.460
Um, and he's talking about having Elvira as a survivor and I was like, or a killer.

39:33.460 --> 39:38.020
And I was like, nah, survivor would kick the observer out of his little damn tower and

39:38.020 --> 39:40.180
give us narc the entire time.

39:40.180 --> 39:40.500
Yeah.

39:40.500 --> 39:46.340
I would see Elvira more as somebody that, uh, it, you would see in the, um, the, why

39:46.340 --> 39:51.540
don't I keep, when you say the, uh, the book, the, the, that mode, the shrine of

39:51.540 --> 39:55.140
secrets, that whole thing or that whole thing for the, for the record, Michigan's

39:55.140 --> 39:58.660
Lizzie Borden actually did not kill anybody.

39:59.460 --> 40:05.620
She was, uh, actually never, um, uh, what was the word I'm thinking of?

40:05.620 --> 40:07.700
She, she was a judge, not guilty.

40:08.260 --> 40:17.060
So I don't like that, that a girl's reputation has been sullied by people

40:17.060 --> 40:18.500
wanting to blame her for a murder.

40:18.500 --> 40:19.380
She didn't do so.

40:20.420 --> 40:21.140
All right.

40:21.140 --> 40:22.260
We, we said no more dead by daylight.

40:22.260 --> 40:23.780
Phantasm would be great.

40:23.780 --> 40:25.060
End of dead by j lights hat.

40:25.060 --> 40:26.420
Oh, one more, one more.

40:26.420 --> 40:32.820
No, the, the, the, uh, pastor from, uh, poltergeist too.

40:32.820 --> 40:33.780
All right.

40:33.780 --> 40:35.540
And he sings the whole time like the huntress.

40:36.100 --> 40:37.380
Enough, but it definitely should.

40:37.380 --> 40:38.660
Original trailer Sonic.

40:39.540 --> 40:40.040
Yeah.

40:40.580 --> 40:41.300
All right.

40:41.300 --> 40:42.740
Moving on my gaming week.

40:42.740 --> 40:44.100
I want to talk about my gaming week.

40:44.100 --> 40:45.540
So what did I play during my gaming week?

40:45.540 --> 40:46.580
I played dead by daylight.

40:46.580 --> 40:46.980
Okay.

40:46.980 --> 40:50.340
Uh, besides that, I played more cookie clicker.

40:50.340 --> 40:53.780
I'm up to 400 achievements unlocked in cookie clicker.

40:53.780 --> 40:58.340
I've clicked a lot of cookies, uh, 560 something.

40:58.340 --> 41:00.260
I think is maybe five 40.

41:00.260 --> 41:02.820
Somebody in chat might be able to correct me on that.

41:02.820 --> 41:05.060
But, um, yeah, dead by daylight.

41:05.140 --> 41:05.700
I'm sorry.

41:05.700 --> 41:07.780
I I'm looking at my phone, my notes, but cookie clicker.

41:07.780 --> 41:07.940
Yeah.

41:07.940 --> 41:11.220
I've unlocked 400 of the achievements, uh, in that so far.

41:11.780 --> 41:13.940
Uh, then I played more Final Fantasy 14.

41:13.940 --> 41:17.460
I actually did a little stream on Friday just to, uh, make sure I'm trying to stream on

41:17.460 --> 41:18.900
a somewhat regular basis.

41:18.900 --> 41:24.260
And, uh, I'm still working to get all my classes to 80 before end walkers out.

41:24.260 --> 41:28.260
And the clock is ticking because there's less than 50 days to go before end Walker.

41:28.260 --> 41:30.580
So, um, I gotta, I gotta get going on that.

41:30.580 --> 41:36.980
My monk is 65, my warrior 66 and my black mage is 75.

41:36.980 --> 41:38.020
So I'm really close.

41:38.020 --> 41:42.020
Um, I just gotta, you know, put the pedal to the metal and make sure I'm doing my roulettes

41:42.020 --> 41:45.460
every day, um, to get up to 80 on all the classes.

41:46.180 --> 41:52.180
I've also been continuing to play Final Fantasy 13 on Xbox backwards compatibility.

41:52.180 --> 41:54.180
I just got to chapter seven today.

41:54.180 --> 41:56.340
So I've been, you know, making my way a little bit through that.

41:56.420 --> 42:01.300
And, uh, the, I, I posted some things on Twitter and stuff with some of the like cutscenes

42:01.300 --> 42:05.300
and things, and you can see they look a lot better now than they did on the PlayStation

42:05.300 --> 42:10.180
three, or especially the original Xbox 360 release, uh, really looked, uh, not great,

42:10.180 --> 42:12.260
uh, by today's standards anyway.

42:12.260 --> 42:18.500
Um, so it's nice how they've really, you know, um, uh, made it run on the nicer resolutions.

42:18.500 --> 42:23.940
Uh, it's, it's almost, it's almost like it's a remaster except it's not really, uh, a remaster.

42:23.940 --> 42:26.180
So, um, but it's, uh, it's great.

42:26.980 --> 42:32.260
And then I played one other game this week and it's something that, uh, Loki's talked

42:32.260 --> 42:34.820
a lot about on this show and he did tonight.

42:34.820 --> 42:37.860
And I finally was like, all right, I got to pick up this game and see what this is all

42:37.860 --> 42:38.500
about.

42:38.500 --> 42:41.460
Uh, and so I picked up power wash simulator.

42:41.460 --> 42:44.020
Um, have you ever seen that Reddit?

42:44.020 --> 42:48.100
I think it's called like mildly satisfying or oddly satisfying.

42:48.100 --> 42:53.540
And it's just a collection of pictures that are like, huh, that is, that is mildly satisfying.

42:53.620 --> 42:58.740
Like, it's just like a, like a perfectly organized bookshelf or something where all the colors

42:58.740 --> 43:00.260
have been sorted appropriately.

43:00.260 --> 43:03.700
And you're like, well, that is, that is a mildly satisfying photo, right?

43:04.500 --> 43:06.020
This is that as a game.

43:07.380 --> 43:10.020
That is what our watch simulator is.

43:10.020 --> 43:11.220
You want to know what's funny?

43:11.220 --> 43:11.460
What?

43:12.100 --> 43:14.580
When my meds aren't working, I clean.

43:15.380 --> 43:16.820
Well, then this, this...

43:16.820 --> 43:18.420
And I clean meticulously.

43:18.420 --> 43:19.940
This is a game that's an outlet.

43:19.940 --> 43:24.020
Well, this is wild because I don't clean this well in real life, but being able to have

43:24.020 --> 43:26.180
this in a game sure is a lot of fun.

43:26.180 --> 43:26.740
And okay.

43:26.740 --> 43:28.580
So power wash simulator.

43:28.580 --> 43:30.180
It is exactly yes.

43:30.180 --> 43:33.940
DJ rama S and chat says perfectly organized ethernet cabling.

43:33.940 --> 43:34.180
Yes.

43:34.820 --> 43:36.980
That is so fucking satisfying to look at.

43:36.980 --> 43:37.220
Right.

43:37.860 --> 43:39.860
And that's what power wash simulator is.

43:39.860 --> 43:45.300
And if it's exactly what you think you get dropped in a level where something is really

43:45.300 --> 43:46.420
fucking dirty.

43:46.420 --> 43:52.260
Like one of the early levels is a backyard and it's like everything is just overtaken

43:52.260 --> 43:54.420
with, you know, growth and whatever.

43:54.420 --> 43:58.340
And so you and your little power wash gun just start to go to work and you just do a

43:58.340 --> 43:59.300
little piece at a time.

44:00.260 --> 44:07.300
You just spray it, power washing the patio rocks, power washing the little pond, power

44:07.300 --> 44:12.900
washing the fence, each post and the very satisfying as you complete each little part

44:12.900 --> 44:15.700
and you power wash it to God's satisfaction.

44:15.700 --> 44:21.860
You get the little little day and it lights up and then it becomes super sparkling and

44:21.860 --> 44:23.380
it's really satisfying.

44:23.380 --> 44:25.220
And then you get to bigger and better levels.

44:25.220 --> 44:30.340
So Loki, I just did the playground level was the one I just finished where you have the

44:30.340 --> 44:35.220
Stegosaurus slide that's like purple and you go in there and everything is just like black

44:35.220 --> 44:36.020
mold everywhere.

44:36.020 --> 44:36.420
Right.

44:36.420 --> 44:40.180
But then once you clean everything up, it's like, oh, there's like all these shiny colors

44:40.260 --> 44:41.060
and things.

44:41.060 --> 44:43.940
And then here is the best part.

44:43.940 --> 44:48.740
Here is the part when you're like, ah, now that is satisfying.

44:49.380 --> 44:57.140
Once you beat a level, you are presented with a short movie in fast time of you cleaning

44:57.140 --> 44:57.620
the level.

44:58.580 --> 45:02.660
So you get to see how you removed all the dirt and where.

45:02.660 --> 45:06.180
And it just and then you see very own time lapse.

45:06.180 --> 45:08.180
Yeah, it's very it's its own little time lapse thing.

45:08.740 --> 45:10.500
You know, because it might have taken you like I'm not kidding.

45:10.500 --> 45:13.140
It probably took me like two hours to clean that playground.

45:13.140 --> 45:13.700
Right.

45:13.700 --> 45:17.380
But then once it's done, it's like, ah, you see that time lapse video and you're like.

45:18.500 --> 45:19.620
That's satisfying.

45:21.380 --> 45:24.900
And it also makes me go, I want a power wash gun in real life.

45:24.900 --> 45:28.660
And then I go, oh, wait, I know I live in I live in California.

45:28.660 --> 45:30.900
That's probably not something I'm allowed to have.

45:31.940 --> 45:32.740
Sure it is.

45:32.740 --> 45:33.300
No, you can't.

45:33.300 --> 45:33.700
You can.

45:33.700 --> 45:34.580
I know you can.

45:34.580 --> 45:39.380
But it's it's frowned on to use those probably as much as I do in that game.

45:39.380 --> 45:44.180
Although I do understand that game has modes where you can limit your water consumption

45:44.180 --> 45:46.580
and you can like change the difficulty in ways like that.

45:46.580 --> 45:50.100
I don't know why I would ever do that to myself, because then that is no longer.

45:52.020 --> 45:56.500
I think they're challenge modes where you have like you race against time or you have

45:56.500 --> 46:01.620
like a limited amount of water and then you're supposed to just like see how much you can

46:01.620 --> 46:03.300
clean within that certain time period.

46:04.900 --> 46:09.860
So it's and you might think like, but no, there is because you can actually change the

46:09.860 --> 46:11.860
nozzle on your power washer.

46:11.860 --> 46:15.780
And so you have to decide, do you want to do something that's very strong, but a very,

46:15.780 --> 46:17.780
very, very small kind of stream coming out?

46:17.780 --> 46:19.780
So you're like only washing a little bit.

46:19.780 --> 46:22.820
Or do you want to increase how much of an area your power covering?

46:22.820 --> 46:23.860
But it's not strong.

46:23.860 --> 46:27.620
So you might have to go over an area like four times in order to really clean it.

46:27.620 --> 46:34.580
So SSJ 100 Matt says, wouldn't mind seeing a power wash simulator run in GDQ silly block.

46:34.580 --> 46:35.300
Oh, for sure.

46:35.300 --> 46:38.740
The game is in early access still, though.

46:38.740 --> 46:39.300
But it does.

46:39.300 --> 46:40.580
I don't notice it.

46:40.580 --> 46:42.580
Like I notice games that are in early access.

46:42.580 --> 46:43.700
I don't notice this.

46:43.700 --> 46:47.300
Maybe the fact that there's only really a handful of guns and upgrades.

46:47.300 --> 46:51.060
But like, I don't want that to come across like a negative because I don't think the

46:51.060 --> 46:51.780
game really needs it.

46:51.780 --> 46:53.220
They're adding new levels all the time.

46:53.220 --> 46:56.180
They just added like a carnival level, which I haven't gotten to yet.

46:56.660 --> 46:58.260
I saw the thing on the.

46:58.260 --> 47:02.180
I did one where you were on fucking Mars cleaning the Mars rover.

47:02.180 --> 47:09.140
And I was like, and again, in the mildly satisfying department, your character can jump, right?

47:09.140 --> 47:10.340
So that's how you get to some.

47:10.340 --> 47:13.380
I mean, there are ladders you can move around and things like that to get to high places.

47:13.380 --> 47:14.580
But you can also jump.

47:14.580 --> 47:20.980
But Loki on the Mars level, when you jump, you float, you jump like low gravity like

47:20.980 --> 47:22.420
you would on Mars.

47:22.420 --> 47:25.460
That was very fucking satisfying when that happened.

47:25.460 --> 47:26.980
I was like, oh, I'm on Mars.

47:26.980 --> 47:28.340
My jump is a little different.

47:30.900 --> 47:31.380
That's cool.

47:31.380 --> 47:32.580
I have to try that one.

47:32.580 --> 47:35.060
Yeah, that one was it's not in the career mode.

47:35.060 --> 47:36.340
It's like in a bonus level.

47:38.340 --> 47:43.460
So it's only difficult because there's so many little fucking parts on that thing.

47:43.460 --> 47:46.740
It's constantly going like you're cleaning all these parts.

47:46.740 --> 47:49.940
And then, of course, you're left with like three parts and you're like, I don't know

47:49.940 --> 47:53.140
where these fucking things are on the other.

47:53.140 --> 47:56.420
Nice thing is, too, if you have a hard time seeing the dirt, I think this is very important

47:56.420 --> 47:57.540
for people to know.

47:57.540 --> 48:03.780
If you press the tab key, all the dirt turns fluorescent orange and it becomes much easier

48:03.780 --> 48:04.420
to see.

48:04.420 --> 48:08.660
And so when you also don't have to clean every single thing, it like it'll give it to you

48:08.660 --> 48:09.940
like at 95%.

48:09.940 --> 48:12.020
Yeah, it'll give it to you at a pretty high percentage.

48:12.020 --> 48:12.900
So, yeah.

48:13.860 --> 48:19.780
So anyway, that that is that is my shout out and satisfaction for what is probably I swear

48:19.780 --> 48:22.020
to God will probably be one of my favorite games of the year.

48:22.020 --> 48:24.100
Power wash simulator like no joke.

48:24.100 --> 48:27.620
It's just it is a satisfying fucking gaming experience.

48:27.620 --> 48:30.020
And that's I think all I ask from gaming.

48:30.020 --> 48:34.420
Maybe I'm a little biased because the power wash simulator team actually retweeted a tweet

48:34.420 --> 48:35.220
of mine.

48:35.220 --> 48:37.700
So I got a little semi viral tweet.

48:37.700 --> 48:38.500
I wrote a tweet.

48:39.620 --> 48:44.180
That said, hell, yeah, I play first person shooters and it was a picture of power wash

48:44.180 --> 48:47.940
simulator with me hosing down the deck and they retweeted it.

48:49.780 --> 48:51.460
And so apparently it's caught on.

48:51.460 --> 48:55.060
So I guess that's I'm a first person shooter main now.

48:55.060 --> 48:55.700
There is that.

48:56.260 --> 48:57.060
All right.

48:57.060 --> 49:02.500
So, yeah, these and folks in chat, like, for example, She-Hulk 10 says they have a lawnmower

49:02.500 --> 49:03.780
simulator as well.

49:03.780 --> 49:04.340
Yeah.

49:04.340 --> 49:09.220
And I don't think they're necessarily all done by the same company, but it's just the

49:09.220 --> 49:13.300
simulator games are just suddenly all the rage for whatever reason.

49:13.300 --> 49:18.580
So it's they're good for content because you can do silly things in a lot of them.

49:18.580 --> 49:21.300
And so this one, though, not so much.

49:21.300 --> 49:23.860
This one got a lot of attention because Markiplier is playing it.

49:23.860 --> 49:29.300
He's like a 10, 10, 12 like video series for it.

49:29.300 --> 49:31.060
I mean, he's just really addicted to it.

49:31.060 --> 49:32.980
So that got some popularity.

49:32.980 --> 49:35.220
But yeah, it's just a fun game.

49:36.340 --> 49:39.620
I'll be Bobby Blackwell pointed out my tweet has 69 likes.

49:40.340 --> 49:40.580
Nice.

49:41.300 --> 49:42.420
Nobody liked my tweet.

49:44.100 --> 49:44.600
All right.

49:45.000 --> 49:50.520
Um, so, uh, yeah, yeah, I love in the power wash.

49:50.520 --> 49:51.960
Sam, it's it's a lot of fun.

49:52.760 --> 49:57.080
Tiger Claw in chat says it's funny how a lot of simulators are based on very mundane tasks,

49:57.080 --> 49:57.580
isn't it?

49:58.040 --> 50:01.480
But it's I don't it's I can't explain it.

50:01.480 --> 50:05.560
It's just so satisfying to see the sparkle when you're all done with a level.

50:05.560 --> 50:07.880
So I will be playing a lot more of this game.

50:07.880 --> 50:10.920
And yeah, like I said, probably going to end up on ironically being one of my favorite

50:10.920 --> 50:11.480
games of the year.

50:11.480 --> 50:15.240
All right, let's move on.

50:15.240 --> 50:16.840
We have some other gaming news to get into.

50:17.480 --> 50:18.280
Let's do it.

50:18.840 --> 50:22.280
Because I don't really Oh, I guess Okay, I have one housekeeping little thing I should

50:22.280 --> 50:25.320
probably bring up at some point because I'm not even sure my co hosts know.

50:25.320 --> 50:26.200
So surprise.

50:27.160 --> 50:30.360
I will not be here the last Sunday of the month.

50:31.240 --> 50:34.200
No, then because last Sunday of the month is Halloween.

50:34.200 --> 50:34.680
Oh, shit.

50:34.680 --> 50:35.960
Are we gonna do a show on Halloween?

50:37.000 --> 50:37.720
Probably not.

50:37.720 --> 50:38.680
I didn't think about that.

50:38.680 --> 50:42.440
We might have to because I will not be here on the 24th for sure.

50:42.440 --> 50:45.480
So we might have to tape something in advance for one of those weeks.

50:45.480 --> 50:48.200
Um, so yeah, I will not be here on the 24th.

50:48.200 --> 50:49.400
I'm going to Disneyland.

50:50.680 --> 50:52.040
And you're not taking me?

50:52.040 --> 50:52.540
No.

50:55.480 --> 50:56.600
It's expensive.

50:58.600 --> 51:02.040
But I'm taking Alan and I'll bring you back something if you're nice.

51:02.680 --> 51:03.080
Okay.

51:03.080 --> 51:03.580
Okay.

51:04.120 --> 51:05.880
They don't have Duffy stuff anymore.

51:06.600 --> 51:13.080
Yeah, we're just we were going and I wanted I was like, okay, we plan that weekend to go

51:13.080 --> 51:17.240
and I was like, Alright, well, if I'm going to go down there, then I want to see like,

51:17.240 --> 51:19.480
it's going to be right before Victoria's birthday.

51:19.480 --> 51:20.280
I want to see Victoria.

51:20.280 --> 51:22.360
So I said, Victoria, what are you doing this weekend?

51:22.360 --> 51:24.680
So of course, you know what the reply was?

51:24.680 --> 51:26.200
Well, we're going to Disneyland on this day.

51:26.200 --> 51:27.960
So I was like, Alright, fuck it.

51:27.960 --> 51:29.880
We're going to so we're doing that.

51:29.880 --> 51:34.840
And we're hoping to meet some like Twitch friends and some other IRL friends while we're

51:34.840 --> 51:35.320
down there.

51:35.320 --> 51:37.720
So it's a friend-a-thon while we're down there.

51:37.720 --> 51:42.600
You bet you better, better, better say hi to two of my favorite LA people.

51:43.560 --> 51:45.320
I have a feeling I know who you're talking about.

51:45.320 --> 51:46.600
Let's talk offline.

51:46.600 --> 51:49.080
But Alan is coordinating all that.

51:49.080 --> 51:51.480
So Alan probably took care of that.

51:51.480 --> 51:51.980
So yeah.

51:52.520 --> 51:53.020
Alright.

51:53.640 --> 51:54.680
Anyway, let's move on.

51:54.680 --> 51:56.440
We have some more gaming news to get into.

51:56.440 --> 51:56.940
Loki.

51:57.880 --> 52:03.960
So with the success of Super Mario Brothers and the Super Nintendo World,

52:05.960 --> 52:13.480
Universal and Nintendo are excited to announce the Seth Rogen themed world coming to Super

52:13.480 --> 52:14.440
Nintendo World.

52:14.440 --> 52:16.440
That is, of course, Donkey Kong.

52:18.200 --> 52:22.360
I would hope they would call it Donkey Kong Country, but it's just it's a section of the

52:22.360 --> 52:23.960
world going to be for Donkey Kong.

52:25.880 --> 52:29.720
But yeah, that is going to be something that they're working on at Universal Japan.

52:30.680 --> 52:34.280
Nowhere necessarily when that's going to come out, but oh, yeah.

52:34.280 --> 52:39.000
Opening 2024, it's going to increase the size of Super Nintendo World by 70 percent.

52:40.520 --> 52:43.800
Hopefully it has some better rides in the Super Nintendo World.

52:43.800 --> 52:49.960
As much as I love Mario and stuff and the Mario Kart ride looks all right, I guess not

52:49.960 --> 52:54.200
as cool as the VR Mario Kart that I saw at some of the Namco places.

52:55.720 --> 52:57.880
They could use some more grown up rides.

52:58.440 --> 53:00.600
I'm hoping that they do something like that.

53:01.320 --> 53:07.640
So Tiger Claw in chat says the fact Donkey Kong is being added to Universal Japan might

53:07.640 --> 53:11.880
be the reason why they are bringing Donkey Kong into the Super Mario animated movie.

53:13.080 --> 53:16.840
I actually totally agree with Tiger Claw here.

53:18.280 --> 53:25.800
I think there I can't say that all the time, but I actually think this gives a lot of kind

53:25.800 --> 53:32.600
of fire behind the idea that a big name like Seth Rogen was cast as Donkey Kong because

53:32.600 --> 53:34.600
that is absolutely a spinoff.

53:34.600 --> 53:39.320
They're planning for the future is a more Donkey Kong centered movie in the future.

53:39.880 --> 53:43.560
Bobby Black Wolf in chat says Donkey Kong was literally the first Mario game.

53:43.560 --> 53:47.560
Sure, but now it's the cinematic universe and I don't think the rules have to follow

53:47.560 --> 53:48.680
a similar pattern.

53:48.680 --> 53:54.200
I don't think we have to expect a Donkey Kong movie, but I think there's a lot of interesting

53:54.280 --> 54:02.920
alignments happening that is between the casting of an A-lister like Seth Rogen and this new

54:02.920 --> 54:06.200
news about the park expanding to include Donkey Kong.

54:06.200 --> 54:12.840
Because surely you Nintendo fans and such as I are wondering why isn't it Zelda?

54:14.200 --> 54:19.160
If you're going to expand a Nintendo theme park, would you not add Zelda?

54:19.160 --> 54:20.440
That would make sense, right?

54:20.440 --> 54:22.440
That would be the biggest Mario thing.

54:22.440 --> 54:26.680
Or okay, maybe actually technically Zelda is no longer the new land.

54:26.680 --> 54:32.200
If they really wanted to do the biggest Nintendo franchise at this point, they would add an

54:32.200 --> 54:35.160
Animal Crossing world would be the world that they would add to it.

54:35.720 --> 54:37.320
But they didn't do either of those things.

54:38.120 --> 54:40.600
And this is a movie based theme park.

54:41.320 --> 54:47.160
So I really think that there is a I really think there's a something something here where

54:47.160 --> 54:50.520
Donkey Kong is being set up to be a spin-off movie.

54:50.520 --> 54:51.080
And why not?

54:51.080 --> 54:54.360
I mean, this really could be a whole Nintendo cinematic universe.

54:54.360 --> 54:56.520
If the movie does well, why wouldn't they?

54:56.520 --> 54:59.000
Why wouldn't they do a Mario sequel?

54:59.000 --> 54:59.880
Of course.

54:59.880 --> 55:02.440
Why wouldn't Wario get brought into the picture?

55:02.440 --> 55:03.880
I mean, cross your fingers and toes.

55:03.880 --> 55:05.480
He's Charles Martinet, I suppose.

55:05.480 --> 55:09.160
Those of you that are upset about him not getting past cast as Mario.

55:09.160 --> 55:10.520
Why wouldn't they set that up?

55:10.520 --> 55:11.960
That sort of cinematic thing.

55:11.960 --> 55:13.080
And then Donkey Kong.

55:13.080 --> 55:15.720
And then who knows where it goes from there?

55:15.960 --> 55:20.200
So anyway, TigerClaus says, imagine King K.

55:20.200 --> 55:22.760
Rool shows up in a post-credits scene.

55:22.760 --> 55:25.320
Well, that that'll all but guarantee it, right?

55:25.320 --> 55:28.600
Pod culture says, and everything ends in Smash Brothers.

55:29.320 --> 55:36.040
You joke, but that's that's the they'll have someone come up and talk to you about the

55:36.040 --> 55:37.640
Smash initiative.

55:39.080 --> 55:43.640
I mean, would anyone be upset with that twist?

55:44.520 --> 55:45.240
Nope.

55:45.240 --> 55:45.740
Nope.

55:47.720 --> 55:49.240
So we'll see what happens.

55:49.240 --> 55:53.080
I think that might be a hard thing to pull off because I think the Pokemon movie rights

55:53.880 --> 55:55.240
are now sitting somewhere else.

55:55.240 --> 55:57.800
But it would be interesting to see if they're able to make that work out.

55:57.800 --> 55:58.760
That's for sure.

55:58.760 --> 56:01.080
They they've done ambitious before.

56:01.080 --> 56:03.320
I mean, look at Avengers Endgame.

56:03.960 --> 56:04.440
Sure.

56:04.440 --> 56:09.320
And they ended up bringing things like Fantastic Four and Spider-Man, you know, they've gotten

56:09.320 --> 56:10.600
all those rights worked out.

56:10.600 --> 56:12.360
So anything's possible.

56:12.360 --> 56:12.760
Sure is.

56:12.760 --> 56:14.200
Because Disney owns everything.

56:14.200 --> 56:15.000
Hi, husband.

56:15.000 --> 56:15.500
Thank you.

56:16.760 --> 56:17.240
Thank you.

56:17.240 --> 56:19.640
He set down the coffee I mentioned before.

56:19.640 --> 56:20.200
What is this?

56:20.200 --> 56:26.120
They instead of putting numbers on the drinks now, they draw they draw spooky images.

56:26.120 --> 56:27.880
They drew a spider web on mine.

56:27.880 --> 56:28.840
What is that all about?

56:30.680 --> 56:31.080
All right.

56:31.080 --> 56:32.520
Anyway, thank you.

56:33.400 --> 56:35.560
Okay, let's move on to our oh, shit.

56:35.560 --> 56:36.360
I'm our next story.

56:36.360 --> 56:38.920
I guess I can't enjoy coffee until I read our next story.

56:39.640 --> 56:41.080
Yeah, Rob, let's get to it.

56:41.240 --> 56:46.280
Um, this story has to do with Nintendo buying another studio.

56:46.280 --> 56:49.560
Oh, boy, they've taken one out of Microsoft's playbook lately, haven't they?

56:50.840 --> 56:53.800
I'm sorry, did I say I'm sorry, Sony, my bad.

56:53.800 --> 56:59.320
Sony bought another studio and they're taking a playbook out of Microsoft here because I

56:59.320 --> 57:01.720
feel like Sony has bought a lot of studios.

57:02.520 --> 57:05.240
I feel like we've talked about that a lot in the past couple months.

57:06.120 --> 57:09.080
But these are all studios and this is no exception.

57:09.800 --> 57:14.360
Where it's like, oh, I kind of thought they were involved with Sony already anyway, or

57:14.360 --> 57:16.280
like Sony had an ownership in their way.

57:16.280 --> 57:17.960
It's more like making it official.

57:17.960 --> 57:21.000
So anyway, it's Blue Point Games is who they acquired this week.

57:21.000 --> 57:23.080
Blue Point Games is based out of Austin.

57:23.880 --> 57:28.280
Recently, they remade they did the remake of Demon's Souls, which obviously was a pretty

57:28.280 --> 57:29.720
big PlayStation five.

57:29.720 --> 57:33.800
That was really one of the only PlayStation five launch titles exclusive anyway.

57:33.800 --> 57:37.400
And they also did that Shadow of the Colossus remake as well.

57:37.400 --> 57:44.360
So there's been rumors that Sony was going to buy Blue Point right around the time that

57:44.360 --> 57:45.720
Sony bought Housemarque.

57:45.720 --> 57:48.760
A lot of people were saying they're going to buy Blue Point as well.

57:48.760 --> 57:51.240
And it turns out, yes, that is what's happening.

57:51.240 --> 57:55.720
What is not known as of yet is Blue Point going to be remastering past titles again,

57:55.720 --> 57:57.640
because that seems to be something they do well.

57:57.640 --> 57:59.480
Or are they going to work on a new IP?

58:00.040 --> 58:03.720
We don't know what they're working on yet, but I'm sure we'll find out in the not too

58:03.720 --> 58:04.840
distant future.

58:04.840 --> 58:07.800
So anybody have any strong feelings with that?

58:09.800 --> 58:11.240
No, it's one of those.

58:11.240 --> 58:15.400
I already thought they kind of were owned by Sony, but, you know, I guess it's making

58:15.400 --> 58:20.680
it official a little bit or take their it's what they're taking their relationship to

58:20.680 --> 58:21.960
the next level.

58:21.960 --> 58:22.840
That's what it is.

58:23.560 --> 58:26.440
We knew they were dating and sleeping together.

58:26.440 --> 58:30.440
We just now they're taking it to the next level where, you know, Sony is continuing

58:30.440 --> 58:35.560
their what do you call the polyamory sect.

58:35.560 --> 58:40.760
They're continuing to expand that in their sister wives with yet another studio.

58:40.760 --> 58:41.080
All right.

58:41.080 --> 58:42.040
Forget these analogies.

58:42.040 --> 58:44.200
Let's go to the next story.

58:45.400 --> 58:47.400
I actually have an emergency announcement.

58:47.400 --> 58:47.720
Okay.

58:48.360 --> 58:51.560
You know, one of my favorite channels is the Boundary Break.

58:52.360 --> 58:52.920
I did not.

58:52.920 --> 58:54.200
There's a Dead by Daylight one now.

58:55.000 --> 58:57.080
Oh, that's right.

58:57.160 --> 59:02.680
That's the one where they go outside the different they use like the free cam stuff to explore

59:02.680 --> 59:04.600
different areas and go outside the boundary.

59:04.600 --> 59:08.440
And now you don't even have to be headed on and dead dog for it to happen.

59:10.280 --> 59:17.800
Anyway, there is this has been rumors off and on mostly wishful thinking.

59:17.800 --> 59:25.160
So we thought except now we're getting more reputable reporting about it.

59:25.720 --> 59:31.640
So Konami is going to be following through with their post restructure plan to bring

59:31.640 --> 59:38.200
back some classic game franchises, some of their biggest ones, including Metal Gear,

59:38.200 --> 59:40.200
Castlevania and Silent Hill.

59:42.680 --> 59:47.240
They're trying to at least this is what the talk is.

59:48.040 --> 59:53.480
Sources are saying that the new Castlevania game is going to be a reimagining of this

59:53.560 --> 59:57.000
series and that it's currently internally in development.

59:57.000 --> 59:57.800
Konami Japan.

59:59.400 --> 01:00:02.440
They also are getting some support from external studios.

01:00:02.440 --> 01:00:04.920
I have lots of support from external studios.

01:00:09.160 --> 01:00:11.640
There also looks like they're working with Virtuos.

01:00:12.600 --> 01:00:18.520
So we'll see that's actually trying to do the various

01:00:19.160 --> 01:00:24.600
rereleases for Dark Souls and all of that.

01:00:24.600 --> 01:00:30.360
But there was some talk about Blue Point working on a Metal Gear Solid remake.

01:00:31.080 --> 01:00:32.840
So we'll see.

01:00:32.840 --> 01:00:36.120
I mean, things haven't looked all that positive right now.

01:00:37.320 --> 01:00:41.800
And then there also talks about multiple Silent Hill games that are under development.

01:00:42.440 --> 01:00:44.600
So we'll see.

01:00:44.600 --> 01:00:49.960
I have a couple of questions with this number.

01:00:49.960 --> 01:00:51.320
A couple of shrugs.

01:00:51.320 --> 01:00:54.760
Number one, where the fuck is Suikoden?

01:00:54.760 --> 01:00:59.560
We always we always have these discussions about classic Konami franchises coming back

01:00:59.560 --> 01:01:03.160
and all the love is Castlevania, Metal Gear, Silent Hill.

01:01:03.160 --> 01:01:04.120
Sure, sure, sure.

01:01:04.120 --> 01:01:05.800
Those are all good franchises.

01:01:05.800 --> 01:01:12.040
But can we not have Suikoden uttered in that same sentence of great Konami franchises?

01:01:12.040 --> 01:01:13.800
Obviously, I'm not picking on you, Dark Soccer.

01:01:13.800 --> 01:01:17.720
I'm picking on everything like I'm picking on Konami, of course.

01:01:18.280 --> 01:01:20.520
Why isn't Suikoden part of this conversation?

01:01:20.520 --> 01:01:24.440
But I guess at least we have that whole Ioden Chronicles thing.

01:01:24.440 --> 01:01:26.600
And I think we're all just prayer circling.

01:01:26.600 --> 01:01:33.240
It doesn't turn out like the Mega Man Kickstarter thing that flopped.

01:01:33.800 --> 01:01:34.600
Oh, Mighty No. 9?

01:01:34.600 --> 01:01:35.640
Yes, that one.

01:01:35.640 --> 01:01:37.080
I think we're just all prayer circling.

01:01:37.080 --> 01:01:41.720
It doesn't go that way, which it doesn't look that way.

01:01:41.960 --> 01:01:45.960
You know, so, yeah, that's that's my first question.

01:01:45.960 --> 01:01:46.680
Where is Suikoden?

01:01:46.680 --> 01:01:49.800
My second question is this rumor we're hearing.

01:01:49.800 --> 01:01:51.720
I mean, I feel like we're hearing this rumor every year.

01:01:52.760 --> 01:01:56.120
And again, I don't I don't fault Dark Soccer for bringing it up now, because the reason

01:01:56.120 --> 01:02:02.680
is and why why it's relevant again is that it's more and more respectable or reputable

01:02:02.680 --> 01:02:04.440
blogs that are picking it up.

01:02:04.440 --> 01:02:11.000
This is no longer like so-and-so said on Twitter or my uncle posted on Resetera or whatever

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:12.520
that forum is called now.

01:02:12.520 --> 01:02:14.440
Like it's it's not those types of things.

01:02:14.440 --> 01:02:18.520
This is like sources that have confirmed things for us before confirming that this is what's

01:02:18.520 --> 01:02:19.020
happening.

01:02:20.520 --> 01:02:23.240
So I guess we'll see at next E3.

01:02:24.520 --> 01:02:27.480
So let me ask this question, because we're all longtime Konami fans.

01:02:27.480 --> 01:02:29.720
Oh, by the way, I left out an important seat.

01:02:29.720 --> 01:02:30.040
Damn it.

01:02:30.040 --> 01:02:32.440
I knew I was going to forget something in my gaming week.

01:02:32.440 --> 01:02:34.680
So I'll bring it up here because it's Konami.

01:02:34.680 --> 01:02:36.680
A very important game I played in my gaming week.

01:02:37.480 --> 01:02:41.960
I went to Conquered this week because I went to a concert in the middle of the week.

01:02:41.960 --> 01:02:43.640
I went to see Alanis Morissette in Garbage.

01:02:43.640 --> 01:02:47.480
I was living my best 90s life out in Conquered this week.

01:02:47.480 --> 01:02:50.760
But since we were killing a little time before the concert, we went to round one.

01:02:51.320 --> 01:02:57.240
So I played Beatmania 2DX Beastover, I think is what it's called.

01:02:57.240 --> 01:02:59.560
The newest Beastrover.

01:02:59.560 --> 01:03:00.060
That one.

01:03:00.600 --> 01:03:01.480
I played that.

01:03:02.280 --> 01:03:05.480
It's 2DX 28th style is what it is now, believe it or not.

01:03:06.360 --> 01:03:06.860
Jeez.

01:03:07.320 --> 01:03:07.820
I know.

01:03:09.480 --> 01:03:11.960
Remember when I thought the pinnacle was like 7th style.

01:03:11.960 --> 01:03:12.280
I know.

01:03:12.280 --> 01:03:15.320
Remember when we were driving to Arcade Infinity to play 10th style?

01:03:15.320 --> 01:03:17.560
Like now it's on 23.

01:03:17.560 --> 01:03:19.000
This isn't all that great.

01:03:21.800 --> 01:03:26.040
I will say so they've redone the machine and I don't know if it was redone

01:03:26.600 --> 01:03:29.240
for this one or the last one.

01:03:29.240 --> 01:03:31.560
The magic something was the last.

01:03:31.560 --> 01:03:34.440
I don't remember, but they've redone the machine.

01:03:34.440 --> 01:03:36.600
So I got to play on the new machine.

01:03:36.600 --> 01:03:38.680
It's great because it's a better monitor.

01:03:38.680 --> 01:03:40.520
Now it's a more like high definition monitor.

01:03:40.520 --> 01:03:45.480
The cabinet actually has like sides that are built onto it to help contain the sound.

01:03:45.480 --> 01:03:47.160
And OK, it was OK.

01:03:47.160 --> 01:03:48.040
Heroic verse.

01:03:48.040 --> 01:03:48.600
Thank you, Orange.

01:03:48.600 --> 01:03:48.840
Right.

01:03:48.840 --> 01:03:52.840
See, I knew some of you that are better at following the recent news would pick that

01:03:52.840 --> 01:03:53.400
up there.

01:03:53.400 --> 01:03:56.120
So yeah, it was heroic verse.

01:03:56.120 --> 01:03:57.400
OK, yes.

01:03:57.400 --> 01:03:59.480
So they changed the cabinet with that.

01:04:00.280 --> 01:04:01.720
And here's the best part.

01:04:01.720 --> 01:04:04.440
There is now a monitor below the monitor.

01:04:04.440 --> 01:04:05.960
That's like a touch pad.

01:04:05.960 --> 01:04:09.480
That's where they moved all the sliders to for the sound.

01:04:09.480 --> 01:04:15.160
So you know me, I take all the sliders and I max volume and then you type you or you

01:04:15.160 --> 01:04:16.200
press equalizer.

01:04:16.200 --> 01:04:19.720
You don't have to hit the effector button to get what you want anymore is my point.

01:04:19.720 --> 01:04:21.480
Everything's controlled on that bottom pound.

01:04:21.480 --> 01:04:25.080
You put in your passcodes for EMUs down there and all that other stuff, too.

01:04:25.080 --> 01:04:27.720
So I thought the new cabinet was almost better than anything else.

01:04:28.840 --> 01:04:31.080
But I also played some of the new songs.

01:04:31.080 --> 01:04:35.480
I kind of like because, you know, if I play a 2DX cabinet, I just want to go and play

01:04:35.480 --> 01:04:36.520
old songs all day.

01:04:36.520 --> 01:04:38.920
But I really forced myself to play the new stuff.

01:04:38.920 --> 01:04:40.920
And actually, I enjoyed the stuff I played.

01:04:40.920 --> 01:04:43.720
There's like 2DX red theme is in there.

01:04:43.720 --> 01:04:45.560
I think it's a remix, but it was really good.

01:04:45.560 --> 01:04:48.360
So so yeah, anyway, sorry.

01:04:48.360 --> 01:04:52.200
I know I'm meddling the story a little bit, but that was an important thing for me to

01:04:52.200 --> 01:04:53.880
throw out is that I did get to play that this week.

01:04:55.240 --> 01:04:59.240
And Bobby Black Wolf is asking, did you relax and enjoy the concert?

01:04:59.240 --> 01:05:00.200
Yes, I did.

01:05:00.200 --> 01:05:01.800
And I had a very good time.

01:05:01.800 --> 01:05:05.560
And it's been five days now and I don't feel sick.

01:05:05.560 --> 01:05:06.760
So I think that's a good sign.

01:05:07.480 --> 01:05:09.320
It was all is not outdoor venue anyway.

01:05:09.320 --> 01:05:15.080
But the interesting thing, just a quick tangent about where we were at.

01:05:15.080 --> 01:05:17.000
So Concord is in Contra Costa County.

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:19.080
I did not realize they mandated this.

01:05:19.720 --> 01:05:23.080
We had to have our vaccine cards checked to go into round one.

01:05:23.800 --> 01:05:27.480
And again, when we went to go eat at the restaurant next door, they checked our vaccine card.

01:05:27.480 --> 01:05:28.680
I'm so glad to hear that.

01:05:28.680 --> 01:05:31.640
Which which I'm I'm I'm fine with that.

01:05:31.640 --> 01:05:34.760
I was just more it was it was the pleasant surprise.

01:05:34.760 --> 01:05:39.400
Like, oh, oh, well, yes, I will show you my vaccine card to get in here.

01:05:40.040 --> 01:05:45.960
But the concert venue didn't require it because they're outdoor.

01:05:45.960 --> 01:05:46.920
The others are indoor.

01:05:46.920 --> 01:05:51.960
However, my understanding is as of October 4th, the concert tomorrow, the concert venue

01:05:51.960 --> 01:05:53.720
will also be asking for those sorts of things.

01:05:53.720 --> 01:05:54.840
So I thought that was interesting.

01:05:54.840 --> 01:05:55.640
Very, very interesting.

01:05:56.200 --> 01:05:59.000
Um, anyway, um, where was I?

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:02.200
Oh, yes, the title revivals for Konami and all this stuff.

01:06:02.200 --> 01:06:07.160
So, um, yeah, I mean, like, obviously, Bahmani and Jason kind of referenced it tongue in

01:06:07.160 --> 01:06:07.880
cheek in the intro.

01:06:07.880 --> 01:06:09.960
Bahmani is still doing fine for Konami.

01:06:09.960 --> 01:06:11.000
Nothing's wrong there.

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:14.440
It's all these other home console titles where it's like, damn, we wish they would really

01:06:14.440 --> 01:06:17.160
put themselves on the right track and all that stuff.

01:06:17.160 --> 01:06:24.680
Um, but yeah, I don't know if I trust Konami themselves to do it.

01:06:24.680 --> 01:06:28.200
And I think Loki, when you said that very tongue in cheek about, I hope they're getting

01:06:28.200 --> 01:06:29.960
help from outside sources.

01:06:29.960 --> 01:06:31.000
Big, same.

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:35.720
I mean, the Castlevania Advance Collection is pretty good, but Konami sent that out to

01:06:35.720 --> 01:06:37.320
another developer to put that all together.

01:06:37.320 --> 01:06:39.800
And they were games that already existed anyway.

01:06:39.800 --> 01:06:42.440
So, uh, because the things Konami develops in house.

01:06:43.960 --> 01:06:46.040
Well, Loki, why don't we go to our next story?

01:06:46.040 --> 01:06:47.160
Yeah, let's talk about that.

01:06:47.160 --> 01:06:51.560
Let's talk about the wonderful things that they talk about our concerns in house.

01:06:51.560 --> 01:06:52.840
Please bring in exhibit A.

01:06:53.800 --> 01:07:00.600
As, as I had mentioned during our release, um, a release date segment last week that

01:07:01.160 --> 01:07:03.640
Konami's E football game is coming out.

01:07:03.640 --> 01:07:04.040
That's right.

01:07:04.040 --> 01:07:07.080
That's the game that replaces pro evolution soccer.

01:07:07.080 --> 01:07:12.840
And, uh, it adds a bunch of microtransactions cause it's free to play and you can pre-order

01:07:12.840 --> 01:07:14.280
microtransactions.

01:07:14.280 --> 01:07:16.200
And apparently the game is hot garbage.

01:07:17.080 --> 01:07:18.120
Oh my God.

01:07:18.120 --> 01:07:18.840
Oh my God.

01:07:18.840 --> 01:07:20.600
I am so shocked.

01:07:20.600 --> 01:07:21.720
Are we shocked?

01:07:21.720 --> 01:07:22.200
Clap.

01:07:22.200 --> 01:07:23.000
If you're shocked.

01:07:23.560 --> 01:07:26.840
It like the, the character models look like garbage.

01:07:26.840 --> 01:07:29.320
Um, it doesn't play well.

01:07:29.320 --> 01:07:33.800
And it's funny because like, they're talking about like some of the things that they needed

01:07:33.800 --> 01:07:34.520
to be fixed.

01:07:35.080 --> 01:07:41.000
And you know, a lot of it is like, uh, too ridiculous.

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:43.000
It's like the entire game, basically.

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:49.880
Um, so I'm not really sure what the issue was with this, why it got released in this

01:07:49.960 --> 01:07:50.520
state.

01:07:50.520 --> 01:07:59.400
But I, I mean, it just looks, I know, I know it's because Konami executives are incompetent

01:07:59.400 --> 01:08:05.160
boo-boo idiots that are more concerned with getting something out on a certain date to

01:08:05.160 --> 01:08:08.520
sell a bunch of pre-orders than what the quality of the game is.

01:08:09.160 --> 01:08:10.200
Do I win a prize?

01:08:13.080 --> 01:08:15.080
Probably, uh, no prize.

01:08:15.080 --> 01:08:17.640
So you win a copy of this game, boo.

01:08:18.520 --> 01:08:18.920
Yeah.

01:08:18.920 --> 01:08:25.080
As, um, expected, they, uh, came out and they said, they've acknowledged that there's been

01:08:25.080 --> 01:08:30.680
some reports of problems that users have with experiences or experience with cut scenes,

01:08:30.680 --> 01:08:34.120
facial expressions, movements of players and the behavior of the ball.

01:08:34.120 --> 01:08:35.560
That's the entire game right there.

01:08:35.560 --> 01:08:38.680
I mean, like, I don't really know what more you would have in there.

01:08:38.680 --> 01:08:45.400
Um, they've acknowledged that there are issues they put out there like little, we apologize

01:08:46.360 --> 01:08:47.160
for problems.

01:08:47.160 --> 01:08:48.280
We apologize.

01:08:48.280 --> 01:08:52.760
We apologize for problems with the soccer ball in our soccer game.

01:08:52.760 --> 01:08:53.240
Yeah.

01:08:53.240 --> 01:08:57.720
It says we've received lots of feedback requests regarding the game balance that includes past

01:08:57.720 --> 01:08:58.760
the defense operation.

01:08:58.760 --> 01:09:01.800
We also like to acknowledge there've been many reports of the other issues.

01:09:01.800 --> 01:09:04.760
We just said, uh, we are also very sorry for the problems.

01:09:04.760 --> 01:09:05.640
We want to share everyone.

01:09:05.640 --> 01:09:09.800
It will take all this concern seriously and strive to improve the current situation.

01:09:10.840 --> 01:09:12.760
We will be continuously updated.

01:09:12.760 --> 01:09:15.400
Quality will be improved, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

01:09:18.760 --> 01:09:19.320
Dumb.

01:09:19.320 --> 01:09:20.120
It's really dumb.

01:09:21.080 --> 01:09:24.120
I don't know why they thought it was okay to put this out like this.

01:09:24.920 --> 01:09:26.280
It's a free to play game too.

01:09:26.280 --> 01:09:29.000
Like, like people, like you want them to play this.

01:09:29.880 --> 01:09:31.320
This is their initial impression of it.

01:09:31.320 --> 01:09:33.640
They're not going to come back to this crap.

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:35.560
I don't know.

01:09:36.680 --> 01:09:38.360
So it's gotten, it's down.

01:09:38.360 --> 01:09:42.200
I think it like to, uh, massively negative scores on steam.

01:09:43.320 --> 01:09:44.360
Unsurprisingly.

01:09:44.360 --> 01:09:50.040
Um, I would like to put out a special message to anyone listening to this show who might

01:09:50.040 --> 01:09:56.040
be affiliated with the Italian Siri B the Russian premier league, the French league

01:09:56.040 --> 01:10:01.720
one, the AFC champions league, the Dutch era Divisi and the tie league.

01:10:01.720 --> 01:10:04.840
If you represent any of those soccer leagues and you're listening, excuse me, football

01:10:04.840 --> 01:10:07.720
leagues, and you're listening to this show, please pull your license.

01:10:08.840 --> 01:10:10.440
Please pull your license.

01:10:11.400 --> 01:10:13.400
Do what stranger doing you a disservice.

01:10:13.400 --> 01:10:17.240
Do what stranger things did to dead by daylight and pull your license.

01:10:18.440 --> 01:10:21.560
You know, the only reason they did that for dead by daylight was because of Netflix.

01:10:21.560 --> 01:10:25.960
Do what Catan did to Niantic and pull your license.

01:10:25.960 --> 01:10:31.640
So I just want to point out, like they're talking about putting out new games of these

01:10:31.640 --> 01:10:32.280
franchises.

01:10:32.280 --> 01:10:34.200
Let's talk about the track record of Konami.

01:10:34.200 --> 01:10:38.200
So Metal Gear Solid, we had Metal Gear Solid.

01:10:38.200 --> 01:10:41.720
Was it, I don't even remember it's called cause it's been blocked from my memory.

01:10:41.720 --> 01:10:46.680
Crappy zombie game, Metal Gear Solid, the alternate Metal Gear Solid five universe thing

01:10:46.680 --> 01:10:49.080
that they did hot garbage.

01:10:49.080 --> 01:10:53.960
Um, so there's that the, the reboot Konami or the Contra game that they made that was

01:10:53.960 --> 01:10:56.680
also hot garbage, the 3d one that they did.

01:10:56.680 --> 01:10:58.920
Um, the only thing that's been good.

01:10:59.640 --> 01:11:00.120
Hardcore.

01:11:01.480 --> 01:11:02.840
No, it wasn't Contra hardcore.

01:11:02.840 --> 01:11:06.760
It was, um, that was the Genesis game from back in the day.

01:11:06.760 --> 01:11:07.720
Yeah, that was the Genesis.

01:11:07.720 --> 01:11:07.960
Sorry.

01:11:09.240 --> 01:11:10.120
Rogue Corps.

01:11:10.120 --> 01:11:10.760
Thank you.

01:11:10.760 --> 01:11:11.400
It was close.

01:11:11.400 --> 01:11:11.880
It was close.

01:11:12.520 --> 01:11:16.440
It, it's just, I don't trust them to make a good game anymore.

01:11:16.440 --> 01:11:19.000
Unfortunately, like I, I just don't.

01:11:19.800 --> 01:11:22.840
So I'm not excited.

01:11:22.840 --> 01:11:30.920
Like if they're going to announce it, they couldn't even get the remasters of silent

01:11:30.920 --> 01:11:32.040
Hill to be correct.

01:11:32.040 --> 01:11:35.720
So like what makes me think they're going to be able to tackle a brand new silent Hill

01:11:35.720 --> 01:11:36.360
game?

01:11:36.360 --> 01:11:37.880
It's going to be garbage.

01:11:37.880 --> 01:11:41.880
Although I would argue, and I've said, we've been doing this show a long time.

01:11:42.760 --> 01:11:44.600
And I said this many, many years ago.

01:11:44.600 --> 01:11:46.360
We've all said this many years ago.

01:11:46.360 --> 01:11:48.680
I mean, Konami is doing all right with the Maimani stuff.

01:11:49.320 --> 01:11:50.680
There's other companies that would do better.

01:11:52.680 --> 01:11:53.180
Yeah.

01:11:55.240 --> 01:11:58.360
And I, you, you know, things have come full circle.

01:11:58.920 --> 01:12:02.760
You know, things have come full circle when I'm, I'm sitting here saying, you know, one

01:12:02.760 --> 01:12:08.120
of the people I would really like to see have the Baimani license, the folks behind Step

01:12:08.120 --> 01:12:08.760
Maniacs.

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:12.840
And that's all I'm going to say about that.

01:12:12.840 --> 01:12:15.640
Their games practically have the Baimani license at this point.

01:12:15.640 --> 01:12:19.320
They have all of the, uh, license tracks in there.

01:12:19.880 --> 01:12:23.240
Cause they, they played the long game and they've been playing it very well.

01:12:25.160 --> 01:12:25.880
Anyway.

01:12:25.880 --> 01:12:27.960
All right, let's move on.

01:12:28.040 --> 01:12:34.360
And, uh, talk about our next story, which, uh, has to do with Nintendo rumors that never

01:12:34.360 --> 01:12:34.920
stop.

01:12:34.920 --> 01:12:36.360
Never, never, never stop.

01:12:36.360 --> 01:12:44.600
Um, let's talk about, uh, a 4k switch because a report came out this week from Bloomberg

01:12:44.600 --> 01:12:50.760
who publishes a lot of rumors about Nintendo and, uh, Bloomberg is technically an investor

01:12:50.760 --> 01:12:51.640
type of magazine.

01:12:51.640 --> 01:12:56.680
So they have a reason to be getting into these types of things because they, they post about

01:12:56.680 --> 01:12:59.160
these rumors and stuff for the sake of investors.

01:12:59.160 --> 01:13:02.840
So that's why they get into this whole thing, uh, whether they're right or they're wrong.

01:13:02.840 --> 01:13:09.880
Bloomberg posted a report that said Nintendo gave at least 11 developers a toolkit to create

01:13:09.880 --> 01:13:11.560
4k games for the switch.

01:13:12.920 --> 01:13:17.480
This doesn't usually happen because usually Nintendo says we do not comment on speculation

01:13:17.480 --> 01:13:18.040
or rumors.

01:13:18.600 --> 01:13:23.160
However, I don't know if it's because Bloomberg is a thing geared toward investors.

01:13:23.160 --> 01:13:26.040
I don't know if Nintendo is sick of this shit.com.

01:13:26.040 --> 01:13:30.600
I don't know if Nintendo is just a Nintendo chose violence this day.

01:13:30.600 --> 01:13:36.360
I don't know what it is, but Nintendo decided to put out a statement saying, no, this report

01:13:36.360 --> 01:13:37.320
is not true.

01:13:38.040 --> 01:13:43.640
And that is from the official Nintendo Twitter, a news report on September 30th on Twitter

01:13:43.640 --> 01:13:48.120
falsely claims that Nintendo is supplying tools to drive game development for a Nintendo

01:13:48.120 --> 01:13:53.400
switch with 4k support to ensure correct understanding among our investors and customers.

01:13:54.360 --> 01:13:59.480
Notice the way that's ordered by the way, investors and customers.

01:14:02.120 --> 01:14:03.160
This is very important.

01:14:03.160 --> 01:14:06.600
Y'all understand the key difference here and why Nintendo said something this time.

01:14:07.320 --> 01:14:09.080
It's because they're worried about investors.

01:14:10.600 --> 01:14:14.280
We want to say there's stock prices go down if they're expecting something to come out

01:14:14.280 --> 01:14:15.240
and it's not going to come out.

01:14:17.160 --> 01:14:20.360
We want to clarify that this report is not true.

01:14:20.360 --> 01:14:26.520
We also want to restate that as we announced in July, we have no plans for any new model

01:14:26.520 --> 01:14:33.480
other than Nintendo Switch OLED model, which will launch on October 8th, 2021, which is

01:14:33.480 --> 01:14:34.280
very soon, by the way.

01:14:35.640 --> 01:14:39.560
Again, the Bloomberg report said Nintendo handed out 4k toolkits.

01:14:39.560 --> 01:14:42.520
They asked developers to create games with 4k resolutions.

01:14:43.080 --> 01:14:48.120
They named one of the publishers Zynga was one of the ones that supposedly had that 4k

01:14:48.120 --> 01:14:48.440
kit.

01:14:48.440 --> 01:14:51.080
I guess that's come a long way.

01:14:51.080 --> 01:14:53.800
No, Zynga is doing a Star Wars game, aren't they?

01:14:56.440 --> 01:14:57.000
I think they are.

01:14:57.640 --> 01:14:59.560
I don't really pay attention to what they do anymore.

01:14:59.560 --> 01:15:04.840
So anyway, yeah, and I think everybody's kind of waiting for the 4k to switch, but it is

01:15:04.840 --> 01:15:07.960
just interesting that Nintendo decided to shoot that one down.

01:15:07.960 --> 01:15:13.080
Now, all of that being said, even reading Nintendo's tweet and taking all of that into

01:15:13.080 --> 01:15:13.560
account.

01:15:15.560 --> 01:15:18.680
I actually I believe Bloomberg in this one.

01:15:19.480 --> 01:15:21.640
I should probably because it's on Nintendo Switch.

01:15:21.640 --> 01:15:22.280
I sure do.

01:15:23.240 --> 01:15:30.440
Ah, see, oh, oh, ooh, Loki playing word police here.

01:15:30.440 --> 01:15:31.640
But you're on the right track.

01:15:32.280 --> 01:15:35.240
I absolutely Nintendo's been exploring 4k.

01:15:35.240 --> 01:15:41.320
And I said this when they again, I don't like to turn the show into a game of I said this,

01:15:41.320 --> 01:15:45.400
but dammit, I'm going to take my credit where I can.

01:15:45.400 --> 01:15:49.080
When they announced the OLED switch, what did I say?

01:15:49.080 --> 01:15:54.680
I said they're probably not releasing the 4k switch because of all these stock problems

01:15:54.680 --> 01:15:58.920
with computer chips that the PlayStation 5 and the Xbox Series X are having.

01:15:58.920 --> 01:15:59.720
They can't do it.

01:16:00.600 --> 01:16:04.040
And what are they saying is the reason why they didn't end up doing the 4k switch.

01:16:05.480 --> 01:16:07.000
That, exactly that.

01:16:09.400 --> 01:16:10.600
Because of reasons.

01:16:10.600 --> 01:16:13.160
Yes, it's that specific reason, basically.

01:16:15.400 --> 01:16:18.040
So again, I think a 4k switch.

01:16:18.040 --> 01:16:18.760
Absolutely.

01:16:19.640 --> 01:16:23.960
A Nintendo device that runs 4k is absolutely out on the table.

01:16:23.960 --> 01:16:27.800
But I think now, Loki, I'm going to give you credit for this one because I think you're

01:16:27.800 --> 01:16:28.440
right.

01:16:28.440 --> 01:16:32.360
The way they're playing this game is, well, it's not a switch.

01:16:33.080 --> 01:16:35.400
It's our next console that's going to have a new name.

01:16:35.400 --> 01:16:37.880
Or they can just lie about it and just say whatever, you know?

01:16:37.880 --> 01:16:40.680
What are they going to do?

01:16:40.680 --> 01:16:45.240
I mean, if they're not ready or anywhere near releasing it or announcing it.

01:16:45.240 --> 01:16:46.040
Super Switch.

01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:50.040
Switch U.

01:16:50.040 --> 01:16:50.440
Interesting.

01:16:50.440 --> 01:16:52.120
I saw that on a Grindr profile once.

01:16:52.120 --> 01:16:52.760
All right.

01:16:52.760 --> 01:16:54.920
Anyway, let's move on.

01:16:55.960 --> 01:16:57.480
Next story, Dark Sagra.

01:16:58.840 --> 01:17:06.840
So, well, the game that everybody's playing, every fucking body playing.

01:17:06.840 --> 01:17:07.240
Not me.

01:17:07.960 --> 01:17:11.800
That I can't play is New World.

01:17:12.440 --> 01:17:17.080
And I'm really surprised it's doing as well as it is.

01:17:17.080 --> 01:17:19.480
I mean, they hit some kind of jackpot with it.

01:17:22.040 --> 01:17:26.280
Basically, it's an MMORPG.

01:17:30.200 --> 01:17:33.080
And it's doing well.

01:17:33.160 --> 01:17:44.040
Basically, it is a colonization-themed game, but they've had things done to it to, I guess,

01:17:44.040 --> 01:17:45.240
way tone that down.

01:17:46.600 --> 01:17:58.280
They've brought in some tribal consultants to make things less offensive to Native Americans

01:17:58.280 --> 01:17:59.960
and First Nations peoples.

01:17:59.960 --> 01:18:02.920
This game's been delayed like six times before it came out.

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:06.440
And I think this was one of the reasons they delayed it was to fix some of these story

01:18:06.440 --> 01:18:06.920
problems.

01:18:09.160 --> 01:18:18.840
But now New World has exceeded 750,000 concurrent players on Steam and is being watched by a

01:18:18.840 --> 01:18:19.960
bunch of people on Twitch.

01:18:19.960 --> 01:18:24.360
I mean, basically, the only times I'm actually watching the game is really just to chat with

01:18:24.360 --> 01:18:30.040
my friends because I'm glad they're having a good time, but I really just hang out in

01:18:30.040 --> 01:18:32.200
their channels just to hang out with my friends.

01:18:33.320 --> 01:18:41.080
They haven't put out any sales figures yet, but it's been pretty popular.

01:18:41.080 --> 01:18:42.840
They do have some really long queues.

01:18:42.840 --> 01:18:50.360
I was hearing people complain about that, and there's already caps on, I guess, what

01:18:50.360 --> 01:18:51.400
their guilds are.

01:18:52.600 --> 01:18:54.360
I think it's like 100 members.

01:18:54.360 --> 01:18:59.720
And I know that the one that a lot of our mutual friends are in has hit a cap.

01:18:59.960 --> 01:19:08.760
Yeah, a lot of servers are full now, but it's the success story.

01:19:08.760 --> 01:19:14.200
I mean, they announced three games in 2016, which was New World Breakaway and Crucible.

01:19:15.880 --> 01:19:17.080
Breakaway was canceled.

01:19:17.080 --> 01:19:20.840
Crucible was released, then removed, then canceled.

01:19:22.360 --> 01:19:27.960
And then there were other games that under their code names, Nova and Intensity, that

01:19:27.960 --> 01:19:30.920
were just dumped.

01:19:30.920 --> 01:19:32.040
No rhyme or reason.

01:19:32.760 --> 01:19:35.800
So this one does seem to be doing the trick.

01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:44.920
The reception is kind of mixed on the game, but the people who I talked to who are playing

01:19:44.920 --> 01:19:47.480
it are really enjoying it, really getting into it.

01:19:48.120 --> 01:19:57.400
There's actually a quote on here that they were...

01:20:01.400 --> 01:20:03.480
I'm sorry, I completely lost my train of thought.

01:20:03.480 --> 01:20:09.720
That the Amazon Studios were also having that sort of bro culture thing going on.

01:20:11.240 --> 01:20:16.760
And then there were four different female game developers, so that their worst experiences

01:20:16.840 --> 01:20:20.920
in sexism were at Amazon and being ignored and undermined.

01:20:22.360 --> 01:20:29.720
Yeah, so that makes me not want to support the game, really.

01:20:34.840 --> 01:20:37.400
But at the same time, I also can't.

01:20:38.040 --> 01:20:43.080
Yeah, Amazon's kind of had miss after miss, and this was probably the title that was going

01:20:43.080 --> 01:20:44.280
to make or break the studio.

01:20:45.160 --> 01:20:47.960
And so it sounds like it's caution on the side of make.

01:20:49.160 --> 01:20:53.160
However, obviously, these other issues that you brought up, these are things that Amazon

01:20:53.160 --> 01:20:53.800
has to face.

01:20:54.680 --> 01:20:59.560
I think they already have really had to, especially in the wake of everything else that's going

01:20:59.560 --> 01:21:00.040
on.

01:21:00.040 --> 01:21:02.120
I don't even think it made our show roll tonight.

01:21:02.120 --> 01:21:05.880
But there was a pretty big development in that Activision Blizzard thing about how Blizzard

01:21:05.880 --> 01:21:09.880
has to pay a lot of money, like $18 million out of this whole...

01:21:09.880 --> 01:21:10.680
Well, it's actually not.

01:21:10.680 --> 01:21:13.560
It's like a sixth of what Bobby Kotick makes in a year.

01:21:13.560 --> 01:21:16.440
But they have to pay out this type of settlement and this sort of thing.

01:21:16.440 --> 01:21:21.480
So I think every company that's being called out on this is having to take a look at that

01:21:21.480 --> 01:21:22.520
sort of culture right now.

01:21:23.080 --> 01:21:26.040
I don't know that we have this in the show role, but it's listed here.

01:21:26.040 --> 01:21:26.280
Sure.

01:21:26.920 --> 01:21:31.000
About Lara Miele, I think is how her last name is pronounced.

01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:32.920
Doesn't sound familiar.

01:21:32.920 --> 01:21:35.960
Was promoted to a COO at EA.

01:21:35.960 --> 01:21:36.600
Oh, interesting.

01:21:37.240 --> 01:21:42.440
And according to this, and I'm going to quote, that effectively makes her the most powerful

01:21:42.440 --> 01:21:43.960
woman in gaming by far.

01:21:47.640 --> 01:21:50.520
Take-Two has a female CFO.

01:21:52.120 --> 01:22:00.440
Miele manages EA's 20 plus studios, highest position that worked on corporate video game

01:22:00.440 --> 01:22:00.920
strategy.

01:22:01.560 --> 01:22:05.400
And it looks like, yeah, she's now the boss.

01:22:06.360 --> 01:22:07.640
Chief operations officer.

01:22:09.160 --> 01:22:09.720
Well, good for her.

01:22:10.600 --> 01:22:11.560
And you know what's interesting?

01:22:11.560 --> 01:22:16.360
EA is kind of like, with as much shit as they've gotten over the years, they're not really

01:22:16.360 --> 01:22:18.920
being brought up in these conversations, which is a good thing.

01:22:20.920 --> 01:22:22.840
You're not really hearing about problems at EA.

01:22:22.840 --> 01:22:27.320
So hopefully that's a sign that they're doing something right in that regard, which should

01:22:27.320 --> 01:22:29.080
be applauded and commended.

01:22:29.080 --> 01:22:33.240
I'm not going to say it doesn't mean it isn't happening, but it seems we're not hearing

01:22:33.240 --> 01:22:33.880
anything.

01:22:33.880 --> 01:22:37.960
So back to the new world thing.

01:22:38.760 --> 01:22:41.560
I've noticed a lot of streamers I watch her on this right now, too.

01:22:41.560 --> 01:22:42.920
And that's cool.

01:22:42.920 --> 01:22:45.400
I just can't pick up a second MMO right now.

01:22:45.400 --> 01:22:49.240
There's an expansion less than 50 days away from SE 14.

01:22:49.240 --> 01:22:50.600
I know I'm going to be into that.

01:22:50.600 --> 01:22:51.880
That is what I play right now.

01:22:55.080 --> 01:22:59.080
If I kind of wait till the end of the year, it allows a little time to see, does this

01:22:59.080 --> 01:23:00.440
new world thing last?

01:23:00.440 --> 01:23:02.040
Do people stick with it?

01:23:02.040 --> 01:23:04.200
What quality of life changes do they implement?

01:23:04.200 --> 01:23:08.600
And if people are still as enthused about new world at the end of the year as they are

01:23:08.600 --> 01:23:11.480
now, then I'll probably consider it at that point.

01:23:11.480 --> 01:23:14.840
That's kind of where my head is at with that whole thing.

01:23:14.840 --> 01:23:16.280
So, all right.

01:23:16.840 --> 01:23:18.280
I think we're going to move on to our next story.

01:23:18.280 --> 01:23:20.600
Just to hedge up you guys, I'm going to go AFK for a minute.

01:23:20.600 --> 01:23:20.840
Sorry.

01:23:20.840 --> 01:23:22.200
So you might have to buy a little time.

01:23:22.200 --> 01:23:24.840
So if you guys have random questions in chat, please ask them.

01:23:24.840 --> 01:23:25.480
I'll be right back.

01:23:28.520 --> 01:23:28.920
All right.

01:23:29.240 --> 01:23:33.080
We need more reasons to be mad at Amazon.

01:23:33.080 --> 01:23:39.480
Let's talk about how Amazon is scalping Xbox Series X consoles.

01:23:40.920 --> 01:23:45.320
So, yes, this is actually a thing that's happening right now on Amazon.

01:23:45.320 --> 01:23:51.160
So if you go to Amazon.com and you look for an Xbox Series X, you can see that they are

01:23:51.160 --> 01:23:58.840
selling used consoles actually fulfilled through Amazon warehouse and by Amazon or sold by

01:23:59.480 --> 01:24:06.360
warehouse and they're selling them at a markup of I mean, it's almost a thousand dollars.

01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:11.160
I think it was like nine hundred and eighty four dollars is what they had it listed as,

01:24:12.520 --> 01:24:13.720
which is ridiculous.

01:24:14.840 --> 01:24:17.560
Considering that's almost double the price for the console.

01:24:18.120 --> 01:24:22.600
I mean, I suppose that they're well within the right to do that, but I just think it's

01:24:22.600 --> 01:24:30.280
kind of a really scammy thing to be, you know, scalping consoles on your marketplace.

01:24:30.840 --> 01:24:35.640
I can understand if a third party seller was doing that, but being that it's Amazon themselves.

01:24:40.040 --> 01:24:40.600
I don't know.

01:24:41.720 --> 01:24:51.000
So I don't know if Amazon's come out to say anything about, you know, comment on it or

01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:52.680
anything I doubt that they have.

01:24:52.680 --> 01:24:58.600
But, you know, I think people are still biting the bullet and buying these consoles anyways,

01:24:58.600 --> 01:25:02.600
even for this markup, because they don't know when they're going to be able to get one next at.

01:25:02.600 --> 01:25:06.280
Well, certainly not at retail, but it's a captive audience almost.

01:25:07.160 --> 01:25:07.560
It is.

01:25:07.560 --> 01:25:10.840
I wouldn't be surprised if they're doing the same thing for the PlayStation five.

01:25:12.200 --> 01:25:16.920
I haven't seen that yet, but it is kind of terrible that they're doing this.

01:25:16.920 --> 01:25:20.760
At least I don't know why you would sell your used console to Amazon.

01:25:20.760 --> 01:25:25.080
I know I've seen the advertisements on their site where they try to get you to sell used

01:25:25.080 --> 01:25:27.320
console to them or trade it in or something like that.

01:25:29.160 --> 01:25:35.480
But yeah, I would definitely be clear that let's not support them in this sense as it is.

01:25:38.360 --> 01:25:39.160
Just be patient.

01:25:40.600 --> 01:25:42.760
That's that's pretty much what I'm doing.

01:25:42.760 --> 01:25:46.360
If I see something in the wild that I might want, that's hard to get,

01:25:47.240 --> 01:25:48.200
then I'll go for it.

01:25:48.520 --> 01:25:52.680
If I don't get it, then then say lovey, I save money.

01:25:52.680 --> 01:25:56.360
Yeah, but Bobby, you say that this isn't Amazon selling them,

01:25:56.360 --> 01:26:00.040
but it is saying that it is sold by Amazon Warehouse.

01:26:00.040 --> 01:26:04.440
Now, I understand that Amazon, you know, they have a lot of like third party sellers that

01:26:04.440 --> 01:26:06.520
fulfill through the warehouse.

01:26:06.520 --> 01:26:11.080
But this is actually saying it's being sold by Amazon through Amazon Warehouse.

01:26:11.960 --> 01:26:14.920
And I mean, it doesn't have another seller name on it.

01:26:14.920 --> 01:26:19.640
Amazon Warehouse is they're kind of they do sell some wholesale stuff out of there,

01:26:19.640 --> 01:26:22.600
like used, you know, stuff like that.

01:26:22.600 --> 01:26:23.880
I open box maybe.

01:26:23.880 --> 01:26:26.840
But I think this is actually Amazon in this case.

01:26:28.600 --> 01:26:31.000
It doesn't says it doesn't have another store name on it.

01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:35.640
And all I see is Amazon for all the different, you know, the seller and where it's filled

01:26:35.640 --> 01:26:35.960
through.

01:26:35.960 --> 01:26:37.640
I'm assuming that it is Amazon.

01:26:37.640 --> 01:26:46.440
No, but I guess I don't know.

01:26:48.040 --> 01:26:53.320
I'll tell you what, I'm going to be Switzerland in this and I will just ask the source if

01:26:53.320 --> 01:26:54.840
I really cared that much to know.

01:26:56.920 --> 01:27:05.080
OK, yeah, but I guess Rob is still doing is doing his thing.

01:27:05.080 --> 01:27:07.720
So, you know.

01:27:09.240 --> 01:27:11.160
Well, my next thing is classic games.

01:27:11.160 --> 01:27:14.440
So, yeah, sorry, I'm back.

01:27:14.440 --> 01:27:14.940
Hi.

01:27:15.400 --> 01:27:17.000
OK, welcome back.

01:27:17.960 --> 01:27:18.600
Are we good to go?

01:27:18.600 --> 01:27:19.480
Now it's my turn.

01:27:20.280 --> 01:27:20.840
Oh, sorry.

01:27:21.400 --> 01:27:23.080
Did you want to know?

01:27:23.080 --> 01:27:25.640
No, no, it's my turn to go AFK and get chocolate.

01:27:27.160 --> 01:27:29.480
How can I assume it's not Amazon selling this?

01:27:29.480 --> 01:27:35.000
Because, I mean, it literally says, you know, that this is sold by Amazon Warehouse, ships

01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:36.120
from Amazon.com.

01:27:36.120 --> 01:27:41.640
Like, I don't get how I would assume that this is a third party seller through Amazon

01:27:41.640 --> 01:27:42.120
Warehouse.

01:27:42.120 --> 01:27:46.760
I get like you can have a third party seller and they'll have their seller name sold by

01:27:46.760 --> 01:27:52.440
this person, you know, ships from Amazon.com, whereas they store, you know, some of the

01:27:52.440 --> 01:27:53.560
inventory for them.

01:27:53.560 --> 01:27:57.160
They actually warehouse that and they ship it straight out of their warehouses.

01:27:57.160 --> 01:28:02.040
But like, I don't know in this case, I don't know.

01:28:02.040 --> 01:28:04.360
I don't think this is a third party seller in this sense.

01:28:05.720 --> 01:28:09.880
Agree to disagree, I guess.

01:28:09.880 --> 01:28:13.720
Why can't we just walk into Target and buy one of these off the shelf?

01:28:13.720 --> 01:28:13.960
All right.

01:28:13.960 --> 01:28:14.520
Yes, I know.

01:28:14.520 --> 01:28:16.920
Yes, I know chip shortages, but it's just annoying.

01:28:17.960 --> 01:28:18.280
All right.

01:28:18.280 --> 01:28:20.280
I thought they were honest question.

01:28:20.280 --> 01:28:24.680
I thought they were supposed to, like, pass legislation to, like, try to work on this

01:28:24.680 --> 01:28:25.000
issue.

01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:27.320
Wasn't that a thing that they were talking about that they wanted to?

01:28:28.040 --> 01:28:30.680
There's no legislation being passed anymore.

01:28:30.680 --> 01:28:31.960
Yeah, I guess that's true.

01:28:31.960 --> 01:28:32.520
Good point.

01:28:32.520 --> 01:28:34.760
All right, moving on.

01:28:34.760 --> 01:28:36.840
Well, at least we know this game's coming.

01:28:36.840 --> 01:28:40.280
Monster Hunter Rise will be making its way to the PC.

01:28:40.280 --> 01:28:43.720
It's going to come out on January 12th of 2022.

01:28:45.080 --> 01:28:49.000
So apparently there's some collaborations that are going to be happening with that with

01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:51.880
ghosts and goblins and Sonic the Hedgehog.

01:28:52.520 --> 01:28:55.560
How Sonic the Hedgehog and Monster Hunter are going to come together.

01:28:55.560 --> 01:28:57.480
I'm not sure that could be very interesting, though.

01:28:58.360 --> 01:28:59.080
But anyhow.

01:29:01.560 --> 01:29:04.520
There's also an expansion that's on its way.

01:29:04.520 --> 01:29:06.040
Monster Hunter Rise Sunbreak.

01:29:06.040 --> 01:29:09.960
I think we saw that in the latest Nintendo Direct, and that will be on its way to the

01:29:09.960 --> 01:29:11.320
PC version as well.

01:29:11.320 --> 01:29:14.120
That's due out summer of 2022.

01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:21.880
The Ghosts and Goblins collaboration, the Brave Knight Arthur from Ghosts and Goblins

01:29:21.880 --> 01:29:23.560
will be in the game.

01:29:23.560 --> 01:29:29.240
After you complete an event quest, you can take on Arthur's iconic armor and the throwing

01:29:29.240 --> 01:29:31.240
knives transform into lances.

01:29:31.240 --> 01:29:34.760
So I guess you just go around kind of like you're Arthur, even though you're not actually

01:29:34.760 --> 01:29:35.080
Arthur.

01:29:35.080 --> 01:29:35.720
That's interesting.

01:29:36.520 --> 01:29:41.160
And as far as the details for Sonic the Hedgehog and the 30th anniversary, which I guess is

01:29:41.160 --> 01:29:46.920
also next year, all they're saying is it's happening and the event quest will be out

01:29:46.920 --> 01:29:47.880
in November.

01:29:47.880 --> 01:29:49.720
So that's a ways out.

01:29:49.720 --> 01:29:51.960
So very interesting with that.

01:29:54.920 --> 01:30:00.200
I'm sure there will be some people that will be excited to check that out on the PC when

01:30:00.200 --> 01:30:03.960
that comes out, because it's probably going to look a little better than it does on the

01:30:03.960 --> 01:30:04.840
Switch.

01:30:04.840 --> 01:30:07.640
You know, just especially if you have a beefy PC, we'll see.

01:30:08.280 --> 01:30:11.960
So all right, let's move on.

01:30:12.600 --> 01:30:19.560
We're going to go to a good old classic segment here, and we won't talk about shiny new PC

01:30:19.560 --> 01:30:22.360
games, but we'll talk about some weird things.

01:30:22.360 --> 01:30:23.400
Fucking weird games.

01:30:23.400 --> 01:30:23.960
That's right.

01:30:23.960 --> 01:30:27.000
Let's get to this next segment with this little interlude.

01:30:30.200 --> 01:30:44.760
And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time, where I'll dive into the vault and pull

01:30:44.760 --> 01:30:47.080
out a classic and tell you about it.

01:30:47.080 --> 01:30:49.720
It's time for the classic game of the week.

01:30:51.320 --> 01:30:54.600
This is one big flag, Dark Sakura.

01:30:54.600 --> 01:30:56.360
What did you pick for the flag tonight?

01:30:57.320 --> 01:30:59.880
I picked the SEGA toilet.

01:30:59.880 --> 01:31:01.320
T-O-Y-L-E-T.

01:31:04.120 --> 01:31:07.080
If you're not familiar with what this...

01:31:07.080 --> 01:31:09.320
I can't stop laughing because it's so stupid.

01:31:11.800 --> 01:31:17.240
So they have a little game system at urinals.

01:31:17.880 --> 01:31:21.400
First of all, why's it got to be just for the dick possessing?

01:31:21.400 --> 01:31:22.280
I'm sorry.

01:31:22.280 --> 01:31:24.600
That's sexist as all fuck.

01:31:25.560 --> 01:31:30.280
But it's an interactive urinal system that was developed by SEGA AM1.

01:31:31.480 --> 01:31:35.000
They have LCD screens and pressure sensors.

01:31:35.640 --> 01:31:40.520
They do show like ads between the games, but basically you can play the games and store

01:31:40.520 --> 01:31:43.400
your score on a flash drive.

01:31:45.560 --> 01:31:53.080
They are installed in four stations for Tokyo Metro, including Akihabara, Soga, and Ikebukuro.

01:31:53.320 --> 01:32:02.120
There also were some in Tokyo, Joypolis, so the different minigames on them is one called

01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:10.120
Manic and Piss, which is basically named after the statue of the urinating boy from Brussels.

01:32:11.880 --> 01:32:13.640
Seeing just how hard you can pee.

01:32:14.360 --> 01:32:19.800
There's Graffiti Eraser, where you're going to use your pee to power wash.

01:32:20.360 --> 01:32:22.120
Power washing simulator, y'all.

01:32:22.120 --> 01:32:22.620
No.

01:32:24.360 --> 01:32:32.120
There's one called The North Wind, The Sun, and Me, where you are playing the wind trying

01:32:32.120 --> 01:32:36.440
to lift a girl's skirt by blowing air at her.

01:32:36.440 --> 01:32:38.440
Fucking sexist garbage.

01:32:39.320 --> 01:32:42.440
The strength of the wind is how forceful the pee is.

01:32:43.560 --> 01:32:48.440
And then there's Battle Milk from Nose, where you complete a battle for the nose.

01:32:48.920 --> 01:32:55.240
Where you complete against the person who last used the urinal to compare how strong

01:32:55.240 --> 01:32:56.520
your pee stream is.

01:32:57.880 --> 01:33:03.160
They are represented on screen as jets of milk squirting out of the noses of two characters

01:33:03.160 --> 01:33:04.440
standing in a sumo ring.

01:33:05.240 --> 01:33:07.720
And if you pee harder, you win.

01:33:07.720 --> 01:33:09.800
You knock the opponent out of the ring.

01:33:10.520 --> 01:33:16.040
This is the most stupid thing I've ever heard, especially how sexist these are.

01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:27.480
Um, so there also are a few other types of interactive urinal things, not just by Sega.

01:33:28.440 --> 01:33:35.080
There's a British company called Captive Media that installed them.

01:33:35.800 --> 01:33:39.320
They also use infrared detection for temperature.

01:33:39.320 --> 01:33:40.440
So it's kind of weird.

01:33:41.240 --> 01:33:47.320
But they have them installed at the exhibit in Ballum, London.

01:33:47.400 --> 01:33:50.520
And Tabushbar in Cambridge.

01:33:51.400 --> 01:33:56.360
So you basically use your pee as a directional thing.

01:33:56.360 --> 01:34:00.680
One's called On the Piest, which is a skiing game where you knock over penguins.

01:34:01.880 --> 01:34:05.000
And another one called Clever Dick, which is a pub quiz game.

01:34:06.040 --> 01:34:08.360
You have to answer true or false with your pee.

01:34:11.560 --> 01:34:12.360
There's a few others.

01:34:12.360 --> 01:34:16.920
One's called Place to Pee that was formerly called Pee Station.

01:34:16.920 --> 01:34:20.520
Sorry, Plee Station, which Plee means toilet in Dutch.

01:34:20.520 --> 01:34:22.440
I think Pee Station would have been funnier.

01:34:23.560 --> 01:34:31.320
But it's more interactive pissing in the terminal.

01:34:31.880 --> 01:34:36.520
There's also called the Interactive Urinal Communicator, which is an advertising device.

01:34:39.400 --> 01:34:44.760
And it basically is just trying to sell you shit with your pee.

01:34:45.560 --> 01:34:49.560
But of course, the best of them all is the Sega toilet,

01:34:50.280 --> 01:34:52.920
because they're terrible humans who came up with this.

01:34:54.040 --> 01:34:54.600
And that's it.

01:34:56.760 --> 01:35:01.320
Seriously, install a Nintendo in the ladies room, please.

01:35:02.680 --> 01:35:05.080
Did you say it sells you shit with your pee?

01:35:05.080 --> 01:35:08.360
Like, I'm reminded of that South Park episode, the poo that took a pee.

01:35:10.040 --> 01:35:10.760
Anyone?

01:35:10.760 --> 01:35:17.480
It it's it's just it's novel, which is why I did it.

01:35:18.040 --> 01:35:20.520
But at the same time, it is intensely sexist.

01:35:20.520 --> 01:35:23.000
It's just I I'm exhausted.

01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:25.160
Like this whole segment has made me exhausted.

01:35:27.160 --> 01:35:35.320
I don't understand what if you're going to pee, why it should be made into a game?

01:35:37.400 --> 01:35:39.400
How long are people peeing for?

01:35:39.400 --> 01:35:42.760
Next year, we're going to have like the poop strength test or something.

01:35:43.720 --> 01:35:46.680
The bigger shit you lay, the higher score you get.

01:35:47.720 --> 01:35:52.760
I'm trying to think of places I want to be less than a public restroom.

01:35:54.440 --> 01:36:00.040
Not to mention, like, you know, like flashing screen images and sounds are just going to

01:36:00.040 --> 01:36:03.640
draw the attention of the person next to you to look at your screens.

01:36:03.640 --> 01:36:05.960
Like, I'm sorry, that's even more uncomfortable.

01:36:05.960 --> 01:36:08.360
Is peeing in Japan naturally competitive?

01:36:09.480 --> 01:36:10.040
I don't know.

01:36:10.040 --> 01:36:11.560
Everything is competitive.

01:36:11.560 --> 01:36:12.440
That's the stereotype.

01:36:13.080 --> 01:36:17.800
Tiger Claw in chat says this is something they should probably add in movie theater restrooms,

01:36:17.800 --> 01:36:21.480
because you can probably get a really good score because of all the pee you had to hold

01:36:21.480 --> 01:36:22.840
in while watching a movie.

01:36:22.840 --> 01:36:26.520
While I completely understand and respect your logic, Tiger Claw, I don't ever want

01:36:26.520 --> 01:36:27.240
to see this again.

01:36:28.680 --> 01:36:32.600
No, nobody should consider putting this anywhere in the trash.

01:36:32.600 --> 01:36:33.320
That's where it should go.

01:36:33.880 --> 01:36:34.680
The bin.

01:36:34.680 --> 01:36:35.480
Put it in the bin.

01:36:36.200 --> 01:36:40.920
That's where Mommy is feverishly writing down these ideas for their next game.

01:36:42.120 --> 01:36:43.480
All I can say is no.

01:36:47.400 --> 01:36:48.520
Anyway, the answer is no.

01:36:49.240 --> 01:36:49.800
There it is.

01:36:50.440 --> 01:36:52.360
Your fucking weird arcade game of the month.

01:36:52.360 --> 01:36:53.480
And boy, is it weird.

01:36:54.440 --> 01:36:55.960
The Toylet.

01:36:56.760 --> 01:36:58.920
That's T-O-Y-L-E-T.

01:37:01.240 --> 01:37:04.360
Dark Tetsuya says this is in Yakuza 2, apparently, of course.

01:37:04.360 --> 01:37:05.000
Of course it is.

01:37:05.480 --> 01:37:07.800
All right, let's move on.

01:37:07.800 --> 01:37:09.080
Let's let's travel around.

01:37:09.080 --> 01:37:10.760
Let's cleanse the palette, please.

01:37:10.760 --> 01:37:15.240
Let's let's wash that segment away with some rapid fire news.

01:37:15.800 --> 01:37:18.520
Let's let's let's flush on to our next segment.

01:37:18.520 --> 01:37:19.020
Loki.

01:37:20.120 --> 01:37:29.160
So D3 has announced that Earth Defense 4 6 has been delayed to 2022, to which I say

01:37:29.160 --> 01:37:32.040
I forgot that there was Earth Defense 4 6 coming out.

01:37:32.040 --> 01:37:36.680
Also, they all look the same, and I really wish they would innovate on their game because

01:37:36.680 --> 01:37:40.120
it's like literally the same game that they've released six times now.

01:37:40.120 --> 01:37:43.160
Quite the read coming from you because you're a fan of that franchise normally.

01:37:43.160 --> 01:37:43.720
I am.

01:37:43.720 --> 01:37:47.480
It's stupid fun, but like their games look all the same.

01:37:47.480 --> 01:37:51.080
Like it's always the same, like always the same.

01:37:51.080 --> 01:37:54.200
I just wish they would do something different with it.

01:37:55.320 --> 01:37:56.360
Whatever, it's fine.

01:37:57.560 --> 01:38:01.160
And then speaking of companies not doing anything different,

01:38:02.440 --> 01:38:08.040
apparently still, even though we kind of figured that it's coming, the Grand Theft Auto, the

01:38:08.040 --> 01:38:12.280
trilogy Definitive Edition has popped up on the Korean ratings board.

01:38:12.920 --> 01:38:17.240
And yeah, indicating that, yes, it's probably coming out soon.

01:38:18.760 --> 01:38:20.920
Don't care that it's coming out soon.

01:38:20.920 --> 01:38:23.800
Wish Rockstar Games would do something different, please.

01:38:24.360 --> 01:38:24.860
Thank you.

01:38:25.800 --> 01:38:27.000
Release a new game, please.

01:38:28.200 --> 01:38:29.000
It's been years.

01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:31.400
You take a new table tennis at this point, right?

01:38:31.400 --> 01:38:33.560
Like it's been it's been absolute.

01:38:33.560 --> 01:38:37.800
I would not take a new table tennis game, but like I get it.

01:38:37.800 --> 01:38:39.000
Red Dead Redemption 2.

01:38:39.800 --> 01:38:43.000
Pretty great game, but it's still been years since that's come out, too.

01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:45.160
So like we're ready for a new game.

01:38:46.280 --> 01:38:47.320
All right, please.

01:38:48.040 --> 01:38:48.600
Moving on.

01:38:48.600 --> 01:38:49.640
Dark Sakura, what do you have?

01:38:53.400 --> 01:38:54.920
Besides the mute button pressed.

01:38:54.920 --> 01:38:56.600
I'm hitting it and I said, oh, shit.

01:38:56.600 --> 01:38:57.400
So that's what.

01:38:59.160 --> 01:39:00.840
Konami is doing something cool.

01:39:01.080 --> 01:39:03.320
They want money, so this is a cool thing.

01:39:03.320 --> 01:39:07.560
They're doing a Castlevania soundtrack collection in December.

01:39:08.920 --> 01:39:12.680
It is actually the orders are already up for it.

01:39:12.680 --> 01:39:14.680
It started September 27th.

01:39:15.400 --> 01:39:22.280
If you order them, you will also get a special 14 track CD that has the midi

01:39:22.280 --> 01:39:24.840
arrangements of songs from Castlevania Dracula X.

01:39:25.720 --> 01:39:31.560
And there are four graphic T-shirt designs on Amazon Japan,

01:39:33.160 --> 01:39:34.840
which I may have to look at.

01:39:34.840 --> 01:39:39.480
And this is it's so many discs, y'all.

01:39:39.480 --> 01:39:40.440
It's so many.

01:39:41.640 --> 01:39:45.160
There's like two sets full of delightfulness.

01:39:46.040 --> 01:39:46.840
And I want it.

01:39:48.040 --> 01:39:52.120
The release date for this will be December 15th, 2021 in Japan.

01:39:55.000 --> 01:40:01.080
Also, Castlevania Grimoire of Souls is back in Apple Arcade as an exclusive.

01:40:01.080 --> 01:40:02.840
So I might start streaming that.

01:40:05.560 --> 01:40:09.560
Also, the holodeck is happening, Rob.

01:40:12.600 --> 01:40:14.360
Everything we do in gaming is one step closer.

01:40:15.400 --> 01:40:19.240
Well, now there's this thing called the Dream Cube.

01:40:20.200 --> 01:40:27.400
That is it's like a I mean, really, it's like a room with different screens in it,

01:40:27.400 --> 01:40:29.160
but I can only see this getting better.

01:40:31.160 --> 01:40:38.040
Like there's one that's like playing soccer football where you actually kick

01:40:38.040 --> 01:40:39.160
your ball at targets.

01:40:40.280 --> 01:40:41.400
It's a giant video game.

01:40:41.400 --> 01:40:47.160
I mean, you could you kick it right into the wall as hard as you want to.

01:40:47.320 --> 01:40:53.880
Basically, you know, they are already signing deals with the NBA and Manchester United.

01:40:55.880 --> 01:41:00.520
There are already 16 Dream Cubes that are set up for the Manchester U fans

01:41:01.160 --> 01:41:03.080
United across China.

01:41:04.200 --> 01:41:10.840
It's a 256 square foot virtual reality room, like an interactive cubicle.

01:41:11.640 --> 01:41:16.520
You're in VR with no headset, which honestly,

01:41:16.520 --> 01:41:19.000
it sounds to me like I would just get super motion sick in it,

01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:21.960
but it is closer to the holodeck.

01:41:23.320 --> 01:41:27.160
It moves pixels at 240 frames a second,

01:41:28.680 --> 01:41:32.920
which is like four to eight times as much as most video games.

01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:37.560
You've got like karaoke things in there.

01:41:37.560 --> 01:41:41.960
You have the back wall is left open so that your friends can watch

01:41:41.960 --> 01:41:43.560
or swap in on some of those things.

01:41:44.280 --> 01:41:47.480
But it has all the head tracking.

01:41:47.480 --> 01:41:49.080
It's pretty interesting.

01:41:50.360 --> 01:41:57.720
It started development in 1992 when the University of Illinois developed the CAVE,

01:41:57.720 --> 01:42:00.200
which is Cave Automatic Immersion Environment,

01:42:00.840 --> 01:42:01.800
and it's gone from there.

01:42:02.600 --> 01:42:04.440
So keep your eyes open.

01:42:04.440 --> 01:42:05.320
We're getting close to home.

01:42:05.320 --> 01:42:07.080
There's even like a graffiti mode.

01:42:07.080 --> 01:42:07.720
That's fun.

01:42:09.480 --> 01:42:13.720
So, yeah, can I clean up the graffiti of my urine strains?

01:42:13.720 --> 01:42:15.160
That's a really good question.

01:42:15.160 --> 01:42:18.520
Or my power washer, whichever you prefer.

01:42:20.920 --> 01:42:21.640
I hate it here.

01:42:21.640 --> 01:42:23.640
Dark Sakura is looking for the eject button.

01:42:24.840 --> 01:42:25.560
I hate it here.

01:42:26.840 --> 01:42:27.640
No, you don't.

01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:35.400
Bobby Black Wolf says the 240 frames per second will help you not get sick.

01:42:35.400 --> 01:42:38.120
Yeah, I guess that'll help a little bit with some of that.

01:42:38.120 --> 01:42:38.620
Maybe.

01:42:39.240 --> 01:42:39.740
Maybe.

01:42:41.080 --> 01:42:41.560
That's right.

01:42:41.560 --> 01:42:45.160
I'm only interested in this thing if I can play power washing simulator

01:42:45.160 --> 01:42:48.680
with a power washer, not what Loki was referring to.

01:42:48.680 --> 01:42:50.200
I never want that brought up again.

01:42:50.200 --> 01:42:52.520
They really do need a VR mode for that game.

01:42:53.080 --> 01:42:54.280
I would be down.

01:42:54.280 --> 01:42:58.600
Yeah, while I'm usually against like we don't have to VR everything.

01:42:59.480 --> 01:43:00.760
That one would be kind of fun.

01:43:00.760 --> 01:43:01.640
Yeah, it'll be fun.

01:43:01.640 --> 01:43:02.140
All right.

01:43:02.700 --> 01:43:05.500
Um, if that was it, I think it was.

01:43:05.500 --> 01:43:09.260
Let's go to our world release dates, and we're going to travel around the world

01:43:09.260 --> 01:43:12.220
and check out some releases coming out quite soon.

01:43:14.220 --> 01:43:15.260
Loki, what's out this week?

01:43:16.300 --> 01:43:21.340
So this week we've got, it looks like a Hell Let Loose,

01:43:21.980 --> 01:43:26.860
and that is on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X.

01:43:26.860 --> 01:43:33.260
Alan Wake Remastered on PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One and Xbox Series X.

01:43:34.060 --> 01:43:38.540
BPM Bullets Per Minute, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One on that.

01:43:39.420 --> 01:43:46.140
Exophobia on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One and Xbox Series X.

01:43:47.260 --> 01:43:52.060
Jet the Far Shore on PC, PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5.

01:43:52.780 --> 01:43:55.660
Lego Marvel Super Heroes on Nintendo Switch,

01:43:55.660 --> 01:43:58.060
which is weird because I swear to God that game's already out.

01:43:58.780 --> 01:44:01.100
I guess that's the original one that they're bringing back.

01:44:01.900 --> 01:44:02.620
That's super old.

01:44:03.820 --> 01:44:05.580
This one's actually very exciting.

01:44:05.580 --> 01:44:12.300
Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One,

01:44:12.300 --> 01:44:13.980
Xbox Series X.

01:44:13.980 --> 01:44:15.340
Very excited to see that one.

01:44:16.140 --> 01:44:23.180
Super Monkey Ball Banana Mania on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One,

01:44:23.180 --> 01:44:24.220
Xbox Series X.

01:44:24.940 --> 01:44:31.900
Bar Cry 6 on PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X and Stadia.

01:44:33.340 --> 01:44:39.900
Metroid Dread on Nintendo Switch and Tetris Effect Connected on Nintendo Switch.

01:44:39.900 --> 01:44:40.300
That's it.

01:44:40.300 --> 01:44:41.260
This is a busy week.

01:44:41.900 --> 01:44:42.860
It is a busy week.

01:44:42.860 --> 01:44:44.780
A lot of these releases like snuck up on us.

01:44:45.580 --> 01:44:48.620
I forgot that Nickelodeon thing was happening so soon.

01:44:48.620 --> 01:44:50.300
We are in the fourth quarter.

01:44:50.300 --> 01:44:53.980
I know I knew Metroid was October, but I forgot it was like early October.

01:44:53.980 --> 01:44:56.860
Like, you know, we're giving a lot this week.

01:44:56.860 --> 01:44:59.900
And I should mention, though, you probably won't ever find one.

01:44:59.900 --> 01:45:02.380
The Nintendo Switch OLED is also coming out this week.

01:45:03.260 --> 01:45:04.860
Good luck if you're going after one of those.

01:45:05.980 --> 01:45:07.740
Let's go to Japan right now.

01:45:07.740 --> 01:45:08.380
Get on the plane.

01:45:09.500 --> 01:45:11.820
Japanese releases this week on the Nintendo Switch.

01:45:12.700 --> 01:45:17.340
Shuen no Verce Error Salvation in regular and limited edition.

01:45:18.060 --> 01:45:19.340
Super Monkey Ball.

01:45:19.340 --> 01:45:22.220
It's in English, but it is getting an official Japanese release.

01:45:22.220 --> 01:45:24.300
That is this week as well on the Switch.

01:45:24.300 --> 01:45:28.860

01:45:28.860 --> 01:45:32.380

01:45:32.380 --> 01:45:35.580
Astrea Ascending in a regular and limited edition.

01:45:35.580 --> 01:45:37.340
Or excuse me, regular and special edition.

01:45:37.340 --> 01:45:38.460
That's really the same thing.

01:45:38.460 --> 01:45:39.980
Also out this week in Japan.

01:45:39.980 --> 01:45:46.940
And of course, the OLED Nintendo Switch also out this week in Japan, as is Metroid Dread

01:45:46.940 --> 01:45:50.860
is getting a release along with all the amiibo that come with it as well.

01:45:50.860 --> 01:45:55.420
So it's a very, very busy week with the hardware release and all that stuff in Japan.

01:45:55.420 --> 01:45:59.660
So those of you that like to import, you know, maybe you're going to pick up one of the cool

01:45:59.660 --> 01:46:00.300
little limited.

01:46:00.860 --> 01:46:04.140
I don't think they have anything that special we don't have here, but there's a lot of peripherals

01:46:04.140 --> 01:46:04.780
and things like that.

01:46:04.780 --> 01:46:09.020
And like the third party cases and stuff that might be a little harder to find here.

01:46:09.980 --> 01:46:12.060
Quickly seeing what's going on on the PlayStation 5.

01:46:12.060 --> 01:46:13.740
It's a big week for the Switch.

01:46:13.740 --> 01:46:15.660
But the PlayStation 5 has a few things as well.

01:46:16.700 --> 01:46:20.700
The Super Monkey Ball I talked about earlier is also out on PS5.

01:46:20.700 --> 01:46:25.660
Doki Doki Literature Club Plus, as well as Astrea Ascending in regular and limited edition

01:46:25.660 --> 01:46:26.620
is out this week.

01:46:26.620 --> 01:46:30.060
Far Cry 6 gets a Japanese release this week as well.

01:46:30.060 --> 01:46:35.260
And Back 4 Blood is something to look out for also in Japan this week on the 8th.

01:46:36.220 --> 01:46:37.580
Dark Sakura, how about Europe?

01:46:38.220 --> 01:46:43.180
We have on the 5th, we have Alan Wake Remastered.

01:46:43.180 --> 01:46:45.500
We have Super Monkey Ball, Banana Mania.

01:46:46.220 --> 01:46:48.620
We have on the 7th, Far Cry 6.

01:46:49.180 --> 01:46:55.340
On the 8th, Knockout Home Fitness, Metroid Dread, Alpaca Ball All-Stars.

01:46:55.340 --> 01:46:56.300
Sounds adorable.

01:46:57.100 --> 01:46:59.500
Back 4 Blood Deluxe Edition.

01:47:00.140 --> 01:47:02.380
And that's it for this week.

01:47:03.740 --> 01:47:04.220
All right.

01:47:05.100 --> 01:47:11.900
E3VL in our chat over at twitch.tv slash vognetwork says, don't forget, Emi, last character DLC

01:47:11.900 --> 01:47:13.340
for Smash Brothers Ultimate.

01:47:13.340 --> 01:47:15.340
Do we get that reveal this week as well?

01:47:15.980 --> 01:47:17.180
It's October 8th, right?

01:47:18.060 --> 01:47:19.820
So we'll know that before our next show.

01:47:19.820 --> 01:47:21.100
Oh, that's exciting.

01:47:21.100 --> 01:47:21.900
I wonder what that's.

01:47:22.540 --> 01:47:29.020
Although I disagree with E3VL on who it will be, but it could literally be anything.

01:47:29.980 --> 01:47:34.380
Your suggestion has just as much of a chance as anyone else's.

01:47:34.380 --> 01:47:35.100
So there's that.

01:47:35.100 --> 01:47:36.140
Oh, it's October 5th.

01:47:36.140 --> 01:47:37.420
It's even sooner.

01:47:37.420 --> 01:47:40.540
So gosh, we're going to know real soon who that last character is.

01:47:40.540 --> 01:47:45.740
And everybody's going to say, boy, Sakurai gave in to Waluigi.

01:47:45.740 --> 01:47:46.380
What did you say?

01:47:47.340 --> 01:47:51.420
I don't remember when the Nintendo Direct for the Animal Crossing stuff was.

01:47:51.420 --> 01:47:53.020
I think that's around the same time too.

01:47:53.660 --> 01:47:55.980
Maybe that's the one that was on the 8th that I was mixing up.

01:47:55.980 --> 01:47:56.540
Maybe.

01:47:56.540 --> 01:47:57.040
Maybe.

01:47:57.600 --> 01:48:00.000
So yeah, we're going to get a lot of big Nintendo updates this week.

01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:01.040
This is a big week for Nintendo.

01:48:01.040 --> 01:48:04.480
I mean, technically the OLED Switch is a bit of a new system.

01:48:04.480 --> 01:48:08.560
I mean, it's, you know, E3VL says they did not announce a date.

01:48:08.560 --> 01:48:09.760
And Mike Def's confirming that.

01:48:09.760 --> 01:48:11.440
So they just said October.

01:48:11.440 --> 01:48:13.200
They gave the vague window.

01:48:13.200 --> 01:48:15.360
Maybe they'll announce a date on this one.

01:48:16.720 --> 01:48:17.600
I wouldn't plan on it.

01:48:18.960 --> 01:48:22.320
If Nintendo's proven anything, it's that they can announce it the night before.

01:48:22.320 --> 01:48:23.920
And the internet will still be talking about it.

01:48:23.920 --> 01:48:24.480
It doesn't matter.

01:48:25.120 --> 01:48:27.280
They'll be like, wait, Animal Crossing Direct.

01:48:27.280 --> 01:48:29.040
Why didn't you announce a new Zelda game?

01:48:31.200 --> 01:48:32.240
That'll be Twitter's job.

01:48:32.240 --> 01:48:32.880
Of course it will.

01:48:33.920 --> 01:48:36.080
All right, let's get back into some other news.

01:48:36.080 --> 01:48:36.580
Loki.

01:48:38.480 --> 01:48:38.880
All right.

01:48:38.880 --> 01:48:44.800
Well, speaking of console shortages, we're getting word or at least, I guess, reassurances

01:48:44.800 --> 01:48:52.160
from Xbox VP of gaming, Phil Spencer, that it's not going to be easy to find consoles

01:48:52.160 --> 01:48:53.120
anytime soon.

01:48:53.200 --> 01:48:58.480
So they're saying that they're expecting the console shortage to go into 2022 because,

01:48:58.480 --> 01:49:00.800
of course, chip shortages.

01:49:00.800 --> 01:49:07.360
And unfortunately, it is something that's going to be not resolved definitely this calendar

01:49:07.360 --> 01:49:11.200
year and most likely probably going well into next calendar year.

01:49:12.560 --> 01:49:14.800
So, I mean, you probably already knew that.

01:49:17.280 --> 01:49:21.680
Well, it's still sad to hear that reality, especially with another holiday season.

01:49:21.680 --> 01:49:22.320
I mean, think about it.

01:49:22.320 --> 01:49:25.760
This will be the third Christmas that those systems are impossible to get.

01:49:26.640 --> 01:49:29.840
Yeah, I don't like being reminded that, you know.

01:49:31.840 --> 01:49:36.560
That there's still console shortages out there, I guess, but it'd be nice to have a PlayStation

01:49:36.560 --> 01:49:38.160
five, but I'm in no hurry.

01:49:38.720 --> 01:49:39.920
Yeah, I'm at that point as well.

01:49:39.920 --> 01:49:41.920
It's like, I'll just get one when I get one.

01:49:41.920 --> 01:49:42.420
Whatever.

01:49:43.280 --> 01:49:43.780
All right.

01:49:44.640 --> 01:49:47.520
Uh, Bobby said we had two Christmases since November 20.

01:49:48.080 --> 01:49:49.040
Why can't I math?

01:49:49.040 --> 01:49:49.440
You're right.

01:49:49.440 --> 01:49:51.040
This is the only the second Christmas.

01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:55.680
In my head, we've been talking, I'm staring at 2022 on the screen.

01:49:55.680 --> 01:49:57.520
And so my brain is going that way.

01:49:57.520 --> 01:49:59.680
No, you're I can't map today.

01:49:59.680 --> 01:50:00.640
You got it.

01:50:00.640 --> 01:50:05.680
But still, even the fact that it's a second Christmas and who knows if they say it's continuing

01:50:05.680 --> 01:50:09.040
into 2022, maybe we are looking at three Christmases.

01:50:09.040 --> 01:50:10.400
Maybe I'm not wrong yet.

01:50:11.600 --> 01:50:15.760
So, yeah, I mean, we're going to have all those consoles that are going to get scalped

01:50:15.760 --> 01:50:19.120
and then Amazon will flip them for $3,000 each.

01:50:21.040 --> 01:50:21.520
All right.

01:50:21.520 --> 01:50:25.520
To pay for their, you know, their Twitch promotions.

01:50:27.600 --> 01:50:28.000
All right.

01:50:28.000 --> 01:50:31.840
Well, something that's going to be trying to come back to some sense of normalcy is

01:50:31.840 --> 01:50:33.040
the Game Awards.

01:50:33.040 --> 01:50:36.640
The Game Awards, where, of course, they announce, you know, Jeff Keighley is pretty good at

01:50:36.640 --> 01:50:40.000
getting a lot of good big winner announcements and trailers and things like that.

01:50:40.640 --> 01:50:42.240
It's going to be happening in person.

01:50:42.960 --> 01:50:48.080
The ceremony is going to happen December 9th in Los Angeles, live and in person.

01:50:48.080 --> 01:50:49.840
It's going to happen at the Microsoft Theater.

01:50:51.040 --> 01:50:55.440
And no word yet on any type of COVID precautions.

01:50:55.440 --> 01:50:56.960
Maybe they're kind of banking.

01:50:56.960 --> 01:50:59.200
The numbers are going down and it's December.

01:50:59.200 --> 01:51:00.080
So maybe they won't.

01:51:00.080 --> 01:51:04.480
And it is it's being held in California, which has a lot of strict stuff anyway.

01:51:04.480 --> 01:51:08.320
As I was talking about before, I imagine they're going to require vaccines to get in.

01:51:08.320 --> 01:51:11.920
That's going to like that's going to be a no brainer for something like this in California

01:51:11.920 --> 01:51:13.760
in L.A. Oh, it's L.A. County.

01:51:13.760 --> 01:51:16.800
And I think L.A. County is putting in all those rules.

01:51:16.800 --> 01:51:20.960
So I think that's almost goes without saying you're going to have to have that and probably

01:51:21.840 --> 01:51:24.880
I mean, just really depends where we're at come December, I guess.

01:51:24.880 --> 01:51:26.560
But so it's probably going to look like that.

01:51:26.560 --> 01:51:32.000
But other other than the masks and the vaccines, it'll be a relatively normal ceremony.

01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:33.200
I'm going to be honest.

01:51:34.160 --> 01:51:35.120
Kind of want to go.

01:51:37.280 --> 01:51:42.400
Kind of want to go like if I could do it like reasonably and get down because the public

01:51:42.400 --> 01:51:43.520
can buy tickets, right?

01:51:43.520 --> 01:51:44.160
Or get tickets.

01:51:45.520 --> 01:51:46.480
I would assume so.

01:51:46.480 --> 01:51:52.240
And the last time we saw that venue in like twenty nineteen show, it was like half empty.

01:51:53.360 --> 01:51:55.520
You could you could see it was like half empty in there.

01:51:57.200 --> 01:52:00.560
I kind of want to go like, am I weird for thinking that?

01:52:01.280 --> 01:52:02.880
Would you guys want to go if you could?

01:52:04.480 --> 01:52:06.320
I would love to get out of the house.

01:52:06.320 --> 01:52:10.400
I'm giving up on going to California Extreme, which is the 16th.

01:52:10.400 --> 01:52:11.680
That's like in a couple of weeks.

01:52:11.680 --> 01:52:12.320
Yeah. Yeah.

01:52:13.120 --> 01:52:14.560
But I mean, I don't know.

01:52:14.560 --> 01:52:16.000
I have to see how everything is.

01:52:17.440 --> 01:52:19.440
Loki, we could do I don't trust other people.

01:52:19.440 --> 01:52:20.320
I'll put it that way.

01:52:20.320 --> 01:52:20.880
I hear you.

01:52:20.880 --> 01:52:21.360
I hear you.

01:52:21.360 --> 01:52:25.440
But, you know, if the if the venue requires precautions, then I feel a lot better about

01:52:25.440 --> 01:52:27.520
it than it's like I do want to go to Twitch Con.

01:52:28.320 --> 01:52:31.760
That's you got so much time for the Twitch comes way out.

01:52:31.760 --> 01:52:36.400
I mean, if we are still dealing with covid in the same manner as we are today, like it

01:52:36.400 --> 01:52:39.520
went, which it's like, oh, with the idiots around us.

01:52:39.520 --> 01:52:40.240
Yeah, I know.

01:52:40.240 --> 01:52:40.880
I know.

01:52:40.880 --> 01:52:41.280
I know.

01:52:42.080 --> 01:52:42.480
All right.

01:52:43.040 --> 01:52:44.640
That would be fun to do that.

01:52:44.640 --> 01:52:46.800
I really need to stream more on Twitch.

01:52:46.800 --> 01:52:50.080
So in order to take advantage of that, but I'd still like to see people there.

01:52:51.760 --> 01:52:52.720
So, yeah.

01:52:52.720 --> 01:52:55.760
And of course, the Game Awards is broadcast everywhere.

01:52:55.760 --> 01:52:58.000
And yeah, they're going to be back in the Microsoft Theater.

01:52:59.200 --> 01:53:03.440
They are saying additional details on health and safety will be in the coming weeks.

01:53:03.440 --> 01:53:08.000
And of course, Jeff Keeley is the show will adhere to the best practices and guidance

01:53:08.000 --> 01:53:10.160
from the local health officials, et cetera, et cetera.

01:53:10.160 --> 01:53:12.000
You can bank on because it's in L.A. County.

01:53:12.000 --> 01:53:16.000
It's going to be the strictest precautions that the law allows.

01:53:16.000 --> 01:53:20.160
That's just that's just how it works with certain parts of California.

01:53:20.160 --> 01:53:27.200
So as 200, Matt says, Rob, if you go, you got to dress up like full gown or sweet.

01:53:28.560 --> 01:53:33.760
Don't tempt me because I'll just look at the types of things that Lil Nas X has been wearing

01:53:33.760 --> 01:53:38.720
to different shows, and he's much better looking guy than me and in much better shape.

01:53:38.720 --> 01:53:41.600
And I think oil and we can wrap you up.

01:53:41.600 --> 01:53:44.880
I think he's inherited the prince fashion mantle.

01:53:45.520 --> 01:53:46.240
Well, yeah.

01:53:46.240 --> 01:53:46.640
Oh, yeah.

01:53:46.640 --> 01:53:47.040
Oh, yeah.

01:53:47.040 --> 01:53:47.840
The the prince.

01:53:47.840 --> 01:53:51.600
Well, and then of course, you also have other folks like, oh, my God, why can't I remember

01:53:51.600 --> 01:53:51.920
his name?

01:53:51.920 --> 01:53:54.880
Billy Porter, you know, has been doing that.

01:53:54.880 --> 01:53:56.080
That man is beautiful.

01:53:56.080 --> 01:53:56.720
Yeah.

01:53:56.720 --> 01:54:00.080
So anyway, and I'm sorry, I did cry at that scene in Pose.

01:54:00.880 --> 01:54:04.960
I have I've only seen the first few episodes of Pose, but I don't watch a lot of TV.

01:54:04.960 --> 01:54:05.520
I sobbed.

01:54:06.560 --> 01:54:08.160
Bobby in chat says, I'd want to go.

01:54:08.160 --> 01:54:11.120
Godfrey from Gamertag Radio is going, oh, that's cool.

01:54:11.200 --> 01:54:12.640
I kind of I really want to go.

01:54:13.760 --> 01:54:17.840
Loki, what if like we drove down that day and I got you back by the next day?

01:54:17.840 --> 01:54:19.920
Like, do you think you could swing it?

01:54:21.360 --> 01:54:22.320
When is it again?

01:54:22.320 --> 01:54:23.200
December 9th.

01:54:23.200 --> 01:54:24.000
It's in the middle of the week.

01:54:24.000 --> 01:54:26.320
So we have to take like two days off work, but I could do it.

01:54:27.760 --> 01:54:28.560
Maybe.

01:54:28.560 --> 01:54:28.960
All right.

01:54:29.680 --> 01:54:30.560
I'd love to do it.

01:54:31.920 --> 01:54:33.440
Jamie, of course, you're invited to.

01:54:33.440 --> 01:54:35.760
But I understand your comfort level may be in a different place.

01:54:35.760 --> 01:54:36.560
And that's a OK.

01:54:36.560 --> 01:54:38.560
So if you're what day is that?

01:54:38.560 --> 01:54:39.840
If it's a Saturday?

01:54:40.720 --> 01:54:42.640
It's usually on Thursday, I think.

01:54:42.640 --> 01:54:43.920
I work anyway.

01:54:43.920 --> 01:54:45.360
Yeah, it's in the middle of the week.

01:54:45.360 --> 01:54:49.200
So December 9th is a Thursday.

01:54:50.080 --> 01:54:53.280
I also have another goal for December or January.

01:54:54.800 --> 01:54:56.480
Is that a Twitch related thing or?

01:54:57.040 --> 01:54:58.320
No, I want to go see Tara.

01:54:59.040 --> 01:55:00.080
Oh, that'd be fun.

01:55:00.080 --> 01:55:00.640
Oh, that's right.

01:55:00.640 --> 01:55:03.280
Because they're in Vegas now.

01:55:03.280 --> 01:55:03.600
Yeah.

01:55:03.600 --> 01:55:05.040
Well, back in Vegas.

01:55:05.040 --> 01:55:06.880
I've been for a year, a couple of years.

01:55:06.880 --> 01:55:07.120
Yeah.

01:55:07.120 --> 01:55:08.400
Well, what is time?

01:55:08.400 --> 01:55:12.160
Well, I thought I thought it's been I thought we've had COVID for three Christmases now.

01:55:12.160 --> 01:55:13.360
Apparently, I can't math.

01:55:13.360 --> 01:55:19.680
So I know I, I, I miss my hearts and want to go out and see them.

01:55:20.240 --> 01:55:21.200
Oh, all right.

01:55:21.840 --> 01:55:25.920
Let's move on before you before you head out there at our Sakura.

01:55:26.560 --> 01:55:27.440
Give us our next story.

01:55:30.400 --> 01:55:33.840
The one I accidentally closed because I'm a doof.

01:55:34.480 --> 01:55:35.760
Um, wow.

01:55:35.760 --> 01:55:36.800
Is it even going to load?

01:55:38.640 --> 01:55:42.880
Sorry, my, my stuff decided to take a big shit all of a sudden.

01:55:42.880 --> 01:55:43.200
It's okay.

01:55:43.760 --> 01:55:44.240
There we go.

01:55:45.120 --> 01:55:45.520
Huh?

01:55:45.520 --> 01:55:51.520
I was just at the sidebar says every time I try to open the story.

01:55:53.200 --> 01:55:53.840
There we go.

01:55:54.400 --> 01:55:54.960
All right.

01:55:54.960 --> 01:56:00.000
So, um, Netflix has bought a video game studio.

01:56:00.640 --> 01:56:07.760
They have bought night school studio and, uh, rolled out five mobile, uh, gaming titles

01:56:07.760 --> 01:56:08.960
in the European markets.

01:56:09.760 --> 01:56:18.560
Um, the company, um, sorry, night school studio did Oxenfree, which I mean, that game really,

01:56:18.560 --> 01:56:19.840
really took off very well.

01:56:22.080 --> 01:56:22.480
Yeah.

01:56:22.480 --> 01:56:26.480
So it, if there's a good acquisition, then that would be it.

01:56:26.480 --> 01:56:32.560
So they introduced stranger things, 1984, stranger things, three, the game card blast,

01:56:32.560 --> 01:56:39.280
teeter up and shooting hoops on Android to Netflix subscribers in Spain and Italy.

01:56:40.560 --> 01:56:43.280
And the titles have already been available in Poland.

01:56:43.280 --> 01:56:44.720
So there you go.

01:56:45.520 --> 01:56:48.000
I guess it's something, something.

01:56:50.720 --> 01:56:55.520
Um, it's interesting to see this continue to expand and it's interesting how it's growing

01:56:55.520 --> 01:56:58.640
beyond just the Netflix properties now at this point.

01:56:58.640 --> 01:57:03.120
So we're starting to see more and more with this might look like, and that it, it feels

01:57:03.120 --> 01:57:05.440
like it might be like a separate Netflix thing.

01:57:06.160 --> 01:57:08.480
Like it's not really integrated into the main app.

01:57:08.480 --> 01:57:12.720
I bet on PC, it's going to feel a lot different, but, uh, on the, the mobile device is kind

01:57:12.720 --> 01:57:15.600
of like these two separate sorta sides to it.

01:57:15.600 --> 01:57:19.600
I think this is interesting as it's, it's just continuing to grow, uh, where this might

01:57:19.600 --> 01:57:19.920
end up.

01:57:20.880 --> 01:57:25.680
So, all right, let's move on.

01:57:25.680 --> 01:57:30.400
And, uh, this is, this is something we had kind of joked about before that is now becoming

01:57:30.400 --> 01:57:31.120
a reality, right?

01:57:31.120 --> 01:57:31.440
Loki.

01:57:32.160 --> 01:57:32.480
Yeah.

01:57:32.480 --> 01:57:36.560
So, uh, you know, we're always looking for that Twitch competitor.

01:57:37.520 --> 01:57:38.560
Who's it going to be?

01:57:38.560 --> 01:57:40.320
Who's not Facebook gaming.

01:57:40.320 --> 01:57:44.320
I want to make everybody always jumps in and says, what about Facebook gaming?

01:57:44.320 --> 01:57:46.960
And I said, it has the word Facebook in it.

01:57:46.960 --> 01:57:48.480
Therefore I have no interest in it.

01:57:49.440 --> 01:57:50.000
Yeah.

01:57:50.000 --> 01:58:00.720
So, uh, uh, the site now is, uh, Chatterbait and they're adding support for games in that,

01:58:00.720 --> 01:58:05.600
uh, there is a list of white listed games that are available to play in there.

01:58:06.240 --> 01:58:09.120
Most of them are adult related games.

01:58:09.120 --> 01:58:13.280
Apparently though, like before they used to kind of scold people for doing that.

01:58:13.280 --> 01:58:17.120
Um, but now they do have some of those in there as well.

01:58:17.840 --> 01:58:24.880
Um, and I, ironically though, they also have like other games in there, like logjammers,

01:58:24.880 --> 01:58:28.000
which I guess is like a night or an axe throwing game.

01:58:28.000 --> 01:58:33.600
Um, but yeah, it's, it's mostly just like adult games that are in there.

01:58:33.600 --> 01:58:36.160
I mean, appropriately with the platform, I guess.

01:58:36.160 --> 01:58:40.480
What I want to know about the rules, am I allowed to stream without a shirt on?

01:58:42.400 --> 01:58:43.760
I'm pretty sure that's a yes.

01:58:43.760 --> 01:58:45.840
Cause you know, that's a controversy here on Twitch.

01:58:47.360 --> 01:58:52.960
Although, although, um, they, they did change that rule, uh, some time ago, because I, I know some,

01:58:52.960 --> 01:58:56.400
uh, men here on Twitch who stream without shirts on.

01:58:56.400 --> 01:58:59.920
And there's actually a whole little thing that you put like exclamation shirt.

01:58:59.920 --> 01:59:03.120
Cause people always come in and they're like, you're not supposed to be streaming without a

01:59:03.120 --> 01:59:03.360
shirt.

01:59:03.360 --> 01:59:06.880
It's like that rule changed in 2019 and so forth.

01:59:06.880 --> 01:59:08.480
So it's just, uh, yeah.

01:59:08.480 --> 01:59:12.400
And they've been adding more, uh, games to it and there's been a lot of indie studios

01:59:12.400 --> 01:59:17.840
reaching out to them to, um, add their games or whitelist their games to it.

01:59:17.840 --> 01:59:22.000
So I'm sure that you'll see more of these games on there.

01:59:22.000 --> 01:59:24.880
I mean, there's a lot of them on Steam, so why not?

01:59:25.520 --> 01:59:27.280
If they can stream shirtless, why can't I?

01:59:28.240 --> 01:59:29.440
You could on Chatterbait.

01:59:32.240 --> 01:59:34.560
It just so ridiculous.

01:59:35.840 --> 01:59:36.480
What do you guys say?

01:59:36.480 --> 01:59:41.360
Uh, She-Hulk in chat just says, uh, OLR Chatterbait version 2.0 after dark news.

01:59:41.360 --> 01:59:42.000
What do you guys say?

01:59:42.000 --> 01:59:43.280
You want to move the show to Chatterbait?

01:59:44.560 --> 01:59:47.200
But by the way, do you see where my camera sits?

01:59:48.640 --> 01:59:53.680
No one would see anything anyway, but you can see what I'm wearing right now.

01:59:54.880 --> 01:59:57.280
Oh, it's one of your shirts from your personal store.

01:59:57.840 --> 01:59:58.400
Look at you.

01:59:58.960 --> 02:00:00.160
How'd the quality of that turn out?

02:00:00.160 --> 02:00:00.480
Really?

02:00:00.480 --> 02:00:00.960
I guess good.

02:00:00.960 --> 02:00:01.920
Oh, it's nice.

02:00:01.920 --> 02:00:02.320
It's good.

02:00:02.880 --> 02:00:03.360
It's nice.

02:00:03.360 --> 02:00:06.240
And I just found out I sold another two shirts.

02:00:06.240 --> 02:00:07.120
People like it.

02:00:07.120 --> 02:00:07.840
All right.

02:00:07.840 --> 02:00:08.640
Congrats.

02:00:08.640 --> 02:00:09.120
Congrats on that.

02:00:09.120 --> 02:00:09.280
Yeah.

02:00:10.000 --> 02:00:10.400
All right.

02:00:10.400 --> 02:00:11.600
Well, I'm from my internet.

02:00:11.600 --> 02:00:15.680
I'm sad that we have a little bit of a bummer for this last story tonight, but I do want

02:00:15.680 --> 02:00:17.200
to talk about this and how it does.

02:00:17.200 --> 02:00:19.040
Yes, it does relate to gaming a little bit.

02:00:19.760 --> 02:00:24.720
But, you know, anime fans, uh, were very sad this week to hear about the loss of, uh, and

02:00:24.720 --> 02:00:29.600
I'm sorry if I mispronounced his name, but Takao Saito, uh, who passed away this week

02:00:29.600 --> 02:00:30.400
at 84.

02:00:31.520 --> 02:00:33.200
Uh, oh shit.

02:00:33.200 --> 02:00:33.520
Yeah.

02:00:33.520 --> 02:00:35.760
Uh, he was the creator of Golgo 13.

02:00:36.400 --> 02:00:41.120
Uh, and yeah, nah, he's a big, big, uh, yeah.

02:00:41.360 --> 02:00:43.520
Oh, he did, uh, Baron Air as well.

02:00:44.160 --> 02:00:46.720
He passed due to pancreatic cancer.

02:00:46.720 --> 02:00:48.000
Um, that's always hard to read.

02:00:48.000 --> 02:00:49.040
That's what got granny.

02:00:49.040 --> 02:00:49.760
Yeah, that is.

02:00:49.760 --> 02:00:52.080
And that's, um, and Alex Trebek.

02:00:52.080 --> 02:00:57.440
That's a really, yeah, it's a really, uh, Patrick Swayze, a really nasty, um, cancer

02:00:57.440 --> 02:00:57.760
type.

02:00:57.760 --> 02:00:59.440
It's taken a lot of people from us.

02:00:59.440 --> 02:01:02.240
Uh, so it is a damned hard one to treat.

02:01:02.240 --> 02:01:06.960
Uh, he passed this week at 84th on, uh, I'm sorry, he actually September the 24th.

02:01:06.960 --> 02:01:09.120
So it might've actually been two weeks ago.

02:01:09.120 --> 02:01:13.440
Um, so of course Golgo 13 was, you know, the huge thing that he was known for.

02:01:13.440 --> 02:01:16.720
Uh, and you might be wondering, well, what the hell does that have to do with video games?

02:01:16.720 --> 02:01:20.160
And of course, you know, I'm going to tell you, I'm going to remind you there was a

02:01:20.160 --> 02:01:24.880
Golgo 13 game on the NES and what's interesting about that game.

02:01:24.880 --> 02:01:25.760
I remember them.

02:01:25.760 --> 02:01:27.360
There's some visual novels too.

02:01:27.360 --> 02:01:28.080
Of course, of course.

02:01:28.080 --> 02:01:30.320
I'd be able to walk around backwards in that.

02:01:30.320 --> 02:01:32.160
I remember doing that like moonwalking.

02:01:32.160 --> 02:01:32.880
That was fun.

02:01:32.880 --> 02:01:37.760
I also, in that game, I remember them advertising it in Nintendo power.

02:01:38.320 --> 02:01:42.320
And what was interesting about it was that remember, you know, back in the eighties,

02:01:42.320 --> 02:01:48.960
you know, way back when we weren't quite as aware of the global, uh, pop culture

02:01:48.960 --> 02:01:50.320
market and global things.

02:01:50.320 --> 02:01:56.480
So they marketed Golgo 13 over here without really tying it to the anime.

02:01:56.480 --> 02:02:00.640
Because they assumed most people here wouldn't know of the anime.

02:02:00.640 --> 02:02:03.760
Of course some do, but, you know, especially back in the eighties when there was

02:02:03.760 --> 02:02:05.760
like, well, we didn't get a lot of loop in the third.

02:02:05.760 --> 02:02:06.720
Yeah, exactly.

02:02:06.720 --> 02:02:10.640
We got cliff jumper, which was like a, the castle of Cagliostro.

02:02:11.200 --> 02:02:14.480
So it was just, it was interesting how they had to kind of sell that.

02:02:14.480 --> 02:02:16.480
Uh, and of course they made other games after that too.

02:02:16.480 --> 02:02:19.120
There actually was a DS game in 2009.

02:02:19.120 --> 02:02:22.400
Golgo 13 pursue file G 13.

02:02:22.400 --> 02:02:25.200
But, um, wasn't there a game boy one as well?

02:02:25.200 --> 02:02:32.720
Yeah, there was, um, I, I had read this like not terribly long ago.

02:02:32.720 --> 02:02:38.080
And as I recall, um, for anyone who actually still follows, uh, the manga,

02:02:38.080 --> 02:02:40.080
cause the manga is still in production.

02:02:40.080 --> 02:02:45.520
I think his studio is keeping the story going per her per his wishes.

02:02:45.520 --> 02:02:46.020
Oh, good.

02:02:47.040 --> 02:02:47.540
Yeah.

02:02:48.160 --> 02:02:51.440
Shogakukan, I think it's been a minute.

02:02:51.440 --> 02:02:52.800
I'd have to double check it.

02:02:52.800 --> 02:02:56.160
Dark Tetsuya also points out there's an arcade one with a sniper rifle,

02:02:56.160 --> 02:02:57.920
similar to Konami silent scope.

02:02:57.920 --> 02:03:01.520
So I think you guys series that they should bring back.

02:03:02.400 --> 02:03:04.560
Let's play metal gear for real.

02:03:05.600 --> 02:03:08.960
So I think you guys have the idea that yes, because of its status

02:03:08.960 --> 02:03:14.000
as such a long running, well-known manga in Japan, uh, of course, you know,

02:03:14.000 --> 02:03:17.200
it's bled its way into other pop culture, uh, places.

02:03:17.200 --> 02:03:21.680
So, you know, um, this man's impact, uh, was felt, uh, a lot of places.

02:03:21.680 --> 02:03:24.960
So, uh, you know, we haven't seen a live action series for that,

02:03:24.960 --> 02:03:26.160
or have they done a live act?

02:03:26.160 --> 02:03:29.280
There've been, I think, live, live action Golgo 13.

02:03:29.280 --> 02:03:30.000
I'll double check.

02:03:30.000 --> 02:03:32.320
I'm pretty sure that I've, I've, uh, seen it around.

02:03:33.040 --> 02:03:37.200
Wait, because if that cowboy bebop does well, and it seems like the reception

02:03:37.200 --> 02:03:43.680
to the opening credits and stuff, we're going to go 13 movie came out in 1973.

02:03:44.240 --> 02:03:46.320
But if it does well, does that mean we're going to finally get

02:03:46.320 --> 02:03:48.320
our Leo DiCaprio Akira movie?

02:03:48.320 --> 02:03:52.400
I'm telling you if that cowboy bebop thing on Netflix does well,

02:03:52.400 --> 02:03:55.600
it's going to be the, the, the flood gates will open.

02:03:56.560 --> 02:04:00.480
And by the way, there was a sequel to that live action movie,

02:04:00.480 --> 02:04:03.920
Golgo 13 Assignment Kowloon that starred Sonny Chiba.

02:04:04.800 --> 02:04:05.280
Oh, very cool.

02:04:05.280 --> 02:04:05.440
Yeah.

02:04:05.440 --> 02:04:06.640
That was just brought up in chat too.

02:04:06.640 --> 02:04:07.120
Very cool.

02:04:07.680 --> 02:04:07.920
Yeah.

02:04:07.920 --> 02:04:09.840
I would love to see a live action Trigun.

02:04:10.400 --> 02:04:11.040
That's for sure.

02:04:12.080 --> 02:04:12.400
All right.

02:04:13.520 --> 02:04:16.960
I am going to open up our discord to anybody that wants to call.

02:04:16.960 --> 02:04:18.160
Just join our green room.

02:04:18.160 --> 02:04:20.800
And if you're not on our discord, get, get over there.

02:04:20.800 --> 02:04:24.160
Uh, even if you don't want to call in tonight, uh, join the conversation

02:04:24.240 --> 02:04:27.040
throughout the week over at vognetwork.com slash discord.

02:04:27.040 --> 02:04:28.240
We'll get you on our discord server.

02:04:28.240 --> 02:04:30.800
It's a great way to talk to us throughout the week if you want to.

02:04:30.800 --> 02:04:33.760
Well, at least I don't know how frequently everybody checks in,

02:04:33.760 --> 02:04:35.040
but I'm on it every day.

02:04:35.040 --> 02:04:38.480
So if you want to get ahold of me, uh, you can say hello.

02:04:38.480 --> 02:04:41.680
Um, over in the VOG network, I'm always in discord.

02:04:41.680 --> 02:04:42.240
Awesome.

02:04:42.240 --> 02:04:43.840
Vognetwork.com slash discord.

02:04:43.840 --> 02:04:45.440
If you want to say hello.

02:04:45.440 --> 02:04:49.040
Um, and, uh, we get a lot of story suggestions too, and that's how I

02:04:49.040 --> 02:04:50.640
stay aware of some of the stuff going on.

02:04:51.440 --> 02:04:56.720
I've gotten breaking news from the folks in our VOG network discord.

02:04:56.720 --> 02:05:01.200
Actually, there was something that was posted this week that I saw for the

02:05:01.200 --> 02:05:02.640
first time in that discord.

02:05:02.640 --> 02:05:05.520
And of course, in the moment, I can't remember what it is, but I'm going to

02:05:05.520 --> 02:05:07.680
scroll back through and see if I can find it.

02:05:07.680 --> 02:05:12.960
But of course, once again, invite your calls over at, uh, vognetwork.com

02:05:12.960 --> 02:05:13.760
slash discord.

02:05:13.760 --> 02:05:18.160
If you'd like to give us a call, uh, and in the orange launch radio channel,

02:05:19.120 --> 02:05:22.960
I saw that Konami rumor and the game awards and all that stuff.

02:05:25.040 --> 02:05:26.240
What was it?

02:05:27.200 --> 02:05:31.040
I think it was that Konami, or I'm sorry, the 4k denial thing I'd saw in

02:05:31.040 --> 02:05:34.000
the thing for the first time.

02:05:35.200 --> 02:05:38.800
Oh, there was this interesting thing too, that Bobby had tweeted.

02:05:38.800 --> 02:05:43.200
I had heard about this before, but I thought it was interesting, uh, that

02:05:43.200 --> 02:05:47.120
somebody made a Final Fantasy 14 dancer controller out of a my

02:05:48.000 --> 02:05:49.360
Microsoft connect.

02:05:49.360 --> 02:05:52.240
So you actually have to dance to perform the moves and final.

02:05:52.240 --> 02:05:56.480
It's one of those silly, just because we can things it's like somebody

02:05:56.480 --> 02:06:00.800
beating soul caliber with the dream cast fishing rod, which I know dark

02:06:00.800 --> 02:06:03.360
soccer's referenced on the show before rod caliber.

02:06:03.360 --> 02:06:07.280
That's just somebody do it doing some crazy thing because they can, why not?

02:06:08.160 --> 02:06:13.040
So, um, and Bobby's pointing out the dragon quest, uh, 10 thing most

02:06:13.040 --> 02:06:13.840
recently.

02:06:13.840 --> 02:06:14.000
Yeah.

02:06:14.000 --> 02:06:16.640
I just saw that comment earlier today from 13 X forever.

02:06:16.720 --> 02:06:21.040
Says the dragon quest 10 online that got an offline version some months

02:06:21.040 --> 02:06:21.200
ago.

02:06:21.200 --> 02:06:23.280
And I remember, I remember hearing about that because I want them to

02:06:23.280 --> 02:06:24.400
bring that over here.

02:06:24.400 --> 02:06:27.920
Just quietly got its second expansion as DLC.

02:06:27.920 --> 02:06:31.040
So hopefully we'll get all the expansions for the offline version, which

02:06:31.040 --> 02:06:33.840
brings it closer and closer to a Western localization at some point.

02:06:33.840 --> 02:06:36.640
Hopefully that's what 13 X forever said in our discord.

02:06:36.640 --> 02:06:41.280
Um, and I'd love to, uh, yeah, I really hope that means that they're

02:06:41.280 --> 02:06:43.120
going to localize it for English.

02:06:43.200 --> 02:06:47.440
Cause I'd love to play dragon quest 10 and kind of experience that, um, in

02:06:47.440 --> 02:06:49.920
the offline version, of course, cause I don't think we'll ever get the

02:06:49.920 --> 02:06:50.720
online version.

02:06:51.360 --> 02:06:52.240
That's for sure.

02:06:53.120 --> 02:06:56.640
Uh, anyhow, uh, Oh, we do have somebody in the green room, so let's bring

02:06:56.640 --> 02:06:57.920
them on the air.

02:06:57.920 --> 02:07:02.000
I'm going to, uh, bring them on the air and say hello to them and try to

02:07:02.000 --> 02:07:04.720
get the right camera here on discord.

02:07:04.720 --> 02:07:07.440
But hi, you're on, you are on orange launch radio.

02:07:07.440 --> 02:07:07.920
Who's this?

02:07:08.960 --> 02:07:10.640
Hey, what's going on y'all?

02:07:10.640 --> 02:07:12.080
This is fat Ninja DM.

02:07:12.080 --> 02:07:13.120
It is good to hear from you.

02:07:13.120 --> 02:07:13.920
Fat Ninja DM.

02:07:13.920 --> 02:07:14.400
How are you?

02:07:15.760 --> 02:07:17.040
I am doing awesome.

02:07:17.040 --> 02:07:22.640
I, I probably need my, uh, nerd card revoked cause I did not see the

02:07:22.640 --> 02:07:26.640
passing of the awesome creator of a global 13.

02:07:26.640 --> 02:07:28.080
That is definitely sad.

02:07:28.080 --> 02:07:28.480
You know what?

02:07:28.480 --> 02:07:31.440
There are so many news stories that happen in a week and some of the

02:07:31.440 --> 02:07:33.200
things just slip off the radar.

02:07:33.200 --> 02:07:35.440
That's what podcasts like us are here to do.

02:07:35.440 --> 02:07:39.120
I don't envision that we break the news, but sometimes we pick up the

02:07:39.120 --> 02:07:41.280
news that fell on the floor and slipped through the cracks.

02:07:41.280 --> 02:07:42.960
And, uh, talk about that.

02:07:42.960 --> 02:07:46.320
So unfortunately I wish it was, I wish it was better news.

02:07:46.320 --> 02:07:47.600
Um, but it is what it is.

02:07:48.480 --> 02:07:48.720
Yeah.

02:07:49.520 --> 02:07:53.120
Um, I actually, I just want to talk about real quick about the whole new

02:07:53.120 --> 02:07:53.840
world thing.

02:07:53.840 --> 02:07:57.520
Yes, the cues have been horrendous, but you know, they did add some and

02:07:57.520 --> 02:07:58.400
all that.

02:07:58.400 --> 02:08:04.240
Um, it's one of those things you either really, really enjoy it or you

02:08:04.240 --> 02:08:05.920
just flat out can't stand it.

02:08:05.920 --> 02:08:11.680
And with the, the jankiness of combat right now, it's going to be really,

02:08:11.680 --> 02:08:14.240
really hard for people to latch onto it.

02:08:14.240 --> 02:08:19.520
Now, I'm not saying that it's awful jank, but it's enough jank there that

02:08:19.520 --> 02:08:21.760
will definitely throw some people off.

02:08:21.760 --> 02:08:27.360
But, um, on a scale of one to 10, where one is not that janky and 10 is

02:08:27.360 --> 02:08:28.880
damn it janky.

02:08:28.880 --> 02:08:30.880
Where does, where does this fall?

02:08:32.160 --> 02:08:33.120
Oh man.

02:08:33.120 --> 02:08:36.400
Um, I have to say like a six or a seven.

02:08:36.400 --> 02:08:36.800
Okay.

02:08:36.800 --> 02:08:37.120
Okay.

02:08:37.920 --> 02:08:38.560
Yeah.

02:08:38.560 --> 02:08:41.840
I mean, if you can get over that, it's not a bad game.

02:08:41.840 --> 02:08:47.280
Um, I like the crafting, you know, it's for some reason, uh, y'all talking

02:08:47.280 --> 02:08:50.320
about the power wash simulator a little while ago.

02:08:50.320 --> 02:08:53.760
It's something very satisfying being out in the forest and cutting down

02:08:53.760 --> 02:08:54.640
trees.

02:08:54.640 --> 02:08:58.400
And then I understand that having several other people cutting down

02:08:58.400 --> 02:08:58.720
trees.

02:08:58.720 --> 02:09:02.560
So you see all these trees falling over or a whole bunch of people mining

02:09:02.640 --> 02:09:04.160
some old names or whatever.

02:09:04.160 --> 02:09:08.000
And you hear the pickaxe like tink tink and you hear a whole bunch of them.

02:09:08.000 --> 02:09:08.400
So yeah.

02:09:09.360 --> 02:09:09.600
Yeah.

02:09:09.600 --> 02:09:13.600
You either enjoy it or you'll just flat out like this is garbage and I'm not

02:09:13.600 --> 02:09:14.880
going to play it anymore.

02:09:14.880 --> 02:09:18.400
So, so I assume the way you're talking Fat Ninja, you are playing this game

02:09:18.400 --> 02:09:18.880
right now, right?

02:09:19.680 --> 02:09:20.240
Yes.

02:09:20.240 --> 02:09:22.160
So, um, what is it?

02:09:22.160 --> 02:09:25.200
Do you think that's, you know, cause obviously Dark Sakura, Loki, myself,

02:09:25.200 --> 02:09:26.720
none of us own the game right now.

02:09:26.720 --> 02:09:30.560
We've all kind of watched thanks to Twitch people playing New World, but

02:09:30.560 --> 02:09:33.360
what, what do you think is the reason why?

02:09:33.360 --> 02:09:35.440
I mean, it's breaking steam records.

02:09:35.440 --> 02:09:37.920
It's doing very well for new MMO release.

02:09:37.920 --> 02:09:39.760
What do you think is the reason behind that?

02:09:39.760 --> 02:09:44.080
Is it, is it the, uh, the, the cool crafting system or, you know, especially

02:09:44.080 --> 02:09:46.000
cause you said none of the battle's not that great.

02:09:46.000 --> 02:09:46.640
What do you think it is?

02:09:46.640 --> 02:09:48.720
It's drawing so many people to this game right now.

02:09:49.440 --> 02:09:51.520
It's just a new hotness right now.

02:09:51.520 --> 02:09:57.920
We'll, we'll see within a month or so whether, uh, New World has a staying

02:09:57.920 --> 02:10:03.200
power because yes, um, Amazon is making strides and they're doing things

02:10:03.200 --> 02:10:08.400
pretty quickly to fix things, but as it wears on and then more and more

02:10:08.400 --> 02:10:13.360
people are tired of the long queues and so on and so forth, then we'll

02:10:13.360 --> 02:10:17.840
really actually see, is it the new hotness to say, or is it going to be

02:10:17.840 --> 02:10:19.040
a flash in the pan?

02:10:19.040 --> 02:10:22.000
Like other ones, oh, excuse me.

02:10:23.760 --> 02:10:24.400
Drag them.

02:10:24.640 --> 02:10:31.840
Um, so I think you are very much right on the kind of the new hotness part.

02:10:31.840 --> 02:10:33.360
I think there's a segment of that.

02:10:33.360 --> 02:10:38.880
I think right now, you know, we all know World of Warcraft is not in a good

02:10:38.880 --> 02:10:40.800
spot in many different ways.

02:10:40.800 --> 02:10:43.920
Um, you know, there's everything that's going on with Activision Blizzard.

02:10:43.920 --> 02:10:47.920
There's all the concerns about, you know, um, where the storyline in the

02:10:47.920 --> 02:10:49.360
game is going and so on and so on.

02:10:49.360 --> 02:10:53.200
I'm not really trying to dunk on World of Warcraft, but I think the reality

02:10:53.200 --> 02:10:58.560
is the game is, is hurting more than it's ever hurt in its, you know,

02:10:58.560 --> 02:10:59.600
years long history.

02:11:00.160 --> 02:11:04.480
And, you know, most people have just said, oh, now it's time to play that

02:11:04.480 --> 02:11:06.800
other MMO Final Fantasy 14.

02:11:06.800 --> 02:11:10.480
But I think New World is kind of showing up like those delays in a way,

02:11:10.480 --> 02:11:14.880
I think worked out in its favor because now New World is kind of presenting

02:11:14.880 --> 02:11:19.920
itself as like another option for maybe those that don't think Final Fantasy

02:11:19.920 --> 02:11:23.040
14 is the good fit for them, which is a completely valid thing, right?

02:11:23.280 --> 02:11:26.000
I think you got a lot of like, wow, people that are maybe looking for

02:11:26.000 --> 02:11:29.440
something else in an MMO that maybe like, like some of the crafting and the

02:11:29.440 --> 02:11:30.320
things you talk about.

02:11:30.320 --> 02:11:32.960
I like Final Fantasy 14's crafting system, but it's different.

02:11:32.960 --> 02:11:36.000
So, you know, there's other things maybe the New World's bringing to the table

02:11:36.000 --> 02:11:40.320
that I think they're bringing at just the right time that I think is a huge

02:11:40.320 --> 02:11:41.360
part of this as well.

02:11:41.360 --> 02:11:44.240
And the fact that they are paying Twitch streamers to play it or, you know,

02:11:44.240 --> 02:11:46.080
giving them codes or whatever it is they're doing.

02:11:46.080 --> 02:11:47.200
It certainly helps.

02:11:47.200 --> 02:11:52.160
But I think all of that is just like adding up to like the right stuff that

02:11:52.160 --> 02:11:53.920
makes this game of the moment.

02:11:54.880 --> 02:11:56.320
Oh, yeah, absolutely.

02:11:56.880 --> 02:11:58.000
You know, what's that saying?

02:11:58.000 --> 02:11:59.600
Strike with the iron is hot.

02:11:59.600 --> 02:12:01.120
So that's what they're doing right now.

02:12:01.120 --> 02:12:01.600
Absolutely.

02:12:01.600 --> 02:12:06.720
And by all means, please don't go on a blizzard.

02:12:08.320 --> 02:12:14.640
I think it's one of those things that in the producing or creating of games

02:12:14.640 --> 02:12:19.840
or what have you, you are in this like little bubble of you're constantly

02:12:19.840 --> 02:12:23.760
walking around on eggshells because, you know, people are doing bad things

02:12:23.760 --> 02:12:27.680
and they're constantly walking around these floorboards with all these nails

02:12:27.680 --> 02:12:30.240
and called, you know, countraps sitting all over the floor.

02:12:30.880 --> 02:12:33.920
But, you know, for a while, you know, you're immune.

02:12:33.920 --> 02:12:38.480
You know, you got those thick soled boots or shoes, so you don't, you know,

02:12:38.480 --> 02:12:42.000
skip your feet impaled on those little spikes and stuff.

02:12:42.000 --> 02:12:43.440
But now guess what?

02:12:43.440 --> 02:12:44.640
The shoes and slipped off.

02:12:44.640 --> 02:12:48.000
So now people are stepping all over those spikes and, you know, what's

02:12:48.000 --> 02:12:52.720
making it even, you know, a lot more funny is the simple fact that, you

02:12:52.720 --> 02:12:58.000
know, we have community and, you know, people within these companies sounding

02:12:58.000 --> 02:12:58.400
off.

02:12:58.400 --> 02:13:03.840
And the main person leading the charge is our awesome Dark Sakura, who's

02:13:03.840 --> 02:13:08.000
sitting on the shoulders of these people, putting more weight and driving

02:13:08.000 --> 02:13:10.320
those caltrops and nails in their feet.

02:13:11.200 --> 02:13:15.360
You know, so it's I mean, it's really bad that this has to happen.

02:13:15.440 --> 02:13:18.640
But like you said before, Rob, it just has to happen.

02:13:19.440 --> 02:13:23.600
And, you know, we have to go through that, you know, I guess you could say

02:13:23.600 --> 02:13:26.640
growing pains before things straighten up.

02:13:27.520 --> 02:13:35.120
Yeah, it was a it was something that had to be dealt with because it was

02:13:35.120 --> 02:13:38.080
getting worse and worse and taking over and over.

02:13:38.080 --> 02:13:43.600
It was a it was a virus that was doing horrible things to the gaming industry

02:13:43.600 --> 02:13:45.440
that needs to be addressed.

02:13:45.440 --> 02:13:47.760
Like it's long overdue.

02:13:48.800 --> 02:13:52.000
And hopefully in the case of Blizzard, you know, they have new management

02:13:52.000 --> 02:13:52.320
now.

02:13:52.320 --> 02:13:57.360
The person at the top out, which needed to happen and did happen.

02:13:57.360 --> 02:13:58.880
New people at the top now.

02:13:58.880 --> 02:14:03.520
So it's going to take a little time, but we'll see what effect that they

02:14:03.520 --> 02:14:04.640
have on the culture.

02:14:04.640 --> 02:14:12.320
You know, you have, you know, a woman at the top sharing, you know, so there's

02:14:12.320 --> 02:14:14.480
you know, you could say a lot about that.

02:14:14.480 --> 02:14:17.840
But, you know, the fact that at least there will be some influence there and

02:14:17.840 --> 02:14:23.600
more importantly, in many ways, from a different company, from the outside,

02:14:23.600 --> 02:14:27.920
this Vicarious Visions side that seemed to have been doing a lot of things

02:14:27.920 --> 02:14:28.420
right.

02:14:29.280 --> 02:14:32.400
So it'd be interesting to see what she really brings to the table.

02:14:32.400 --> 02:14:35.680
And then, of course, you know, the other gentleman at the top, Mike Ybarra,

02:14:35.680 --> 02:14:41.280
you've heard a lot with Microsoft and Xbox and has been involved in a lot of

02:14:41.280 --> 02:14:45.920
the right moves that Microsoft's made ever since, you know, Don Mattrick,

02:14:45.920 --> 02:14:49.680
you know, and the clown car that, you know, he was running that flopped the

02:14:49.680 --> 02:14:51.520
Xbox One's initial release.

02:14:51.520 --> 02:14:55.280
So it's going to be interesting to see where Blizzard's at in a year with

02:14:55.280 --> 02:14:55.680
all this.

02:14:56.240 --> 02:14:58.080
Very interested to see what happens.

02:14:58.080 --> 02:15:00.960
But there's a lot of things that need addressing, that's for sure.

02:15:00.960 --> 02:15:03.840
And Diablo 4 cannot flop.

02:15:04.480 --> 02:15:07.520
Diablo, there is so much writing on Diablo 4.

02:15:07.600 --> 02:15:11.680
It cannot flop.

02:15:11.680 --> 02:15:13.520
It cannot afford to flop, period.

02:15:13.520 --> 02:15:14.160
Oh, yeah.

02:15:14.160 --> 02:15:15.200
Yeah, for sure.

02:15:15.200 --> 02:15:18.400
The Barbarians are already at the gate with their pitchforks.

02:15:18.400 --> 02:15:22.080
We're just licking their chops, waiting to attack it.

02:15:22.080 --> 02:15:25.440
And it's not even nowhere near ready yet.

02:15:25.440 --> 02:15:27.840
And barbarian, we mean Bobby Kotek.

02:15:27.840 --> 02:15:28.340
Yes.

02:15:28.800 --> 02:15:29.520
Yes.

02:15:29.520 --> 02:15:30.720
Yes, absolutely.

02:15:30.720 --> 02:15:31.360
Absolutely.

02:15:32.160 --> 02:15:35.840
You know, so before I go, I just, you know, I do send my messages and

02:15:35.840 --> 02:15:38.160
everything, but I just want to just say it on air to all of you.

02:15:38.720 --> 02:15:40.480
I just love what you're doing.

02:15:40.480 --> 02:15:43.040
You know, y'all come from different walks of life.

02:15:43.040 --> 02:15:48.400
You've been through your struggles, your, you know, just awesome triumphs

02:15:48.400 --> 02:15:54.320
in your darkest hour, but y'all still do what you do every single week,

02:15:54.320 --> 02:15:56.320
pretty much weekend and week out.

02:15:56.320 --> 02:16:00.640
And you always make Sundays at this time, something to look forward to.

02:16:00.640 --> 02:16:05.600
And I just really appreciate every last one of you and all your quirks

02:16:05.680 --> 02:16:07.920
and all your triumphs and all your failures.

02:16:07.920 --> 02:16:09.520
I just love all of you.

02:16:09.520 --> 02:16:11.040
You're totally awesome.

02:16:11.040 --> 02:16:16.000
And the community that you have built over these years is totally phenomenal.

02:16:16.000 --> 02:16:20.240
So, you know, claps for everybody, claps for the host and claps for chat.

02:16:20.240 --> 02:16:22.000
Y'all are just totally amazing.

02:16:22.000 --> 02:16:22.800
Thank you so much.

02:16:23.840 --> 02:16:28.320
That means like, that's, that's all we need.

02:16:28.320 --> 02:16:32.960
We, we, it's nice that people give financially and I know you've given

02:16:32.960 --> 02:16:34.880
a lot financially and stuff that, that is nice.

02:16:35.440 --> 02:16:40.480
But what you just gave, that's, that's the feel we really need to get us through

02:16:40.480 --> 02:16:44.720
the next few, you know, years or however long this show keeps going.

02:16:45.520 --> 02:16:46.480
It really means the world.

02:16:47.360 --> 02:16:50.640
I guess, I guess I should say this at some point during the show,

02:16:50.640 --> 02:16:53.040
because something in chat got brought up about this too.

02:16:53.040 --> 02:16:57.760
So Dark Soccer, we probably should let them know about the Guinness World Record thing.

02:16:58.320 --> 02:17:00.320
And yeah, so go ahead.

02:17:00.320 --> 02:17:09.040
They, they denied it because I was submitting it as a single person, which is weird.

02:17:09.920 --> 02:17:10.960
So I have to go back.

02:17:10.960 --> 02:17:13.360
I'm probably going to have to resubmit a different way.

02:17:13.360 --> 02:17:13.860
Yeah.

02:17:14.320 --> 02:17:16.560
But it's just a qualification thing.

02:17:16.560 --> 02:17:20.240
So I'll, I'll just have to figure out the right, the right thing to do it in.

02:17:20.240 --> 02:17:24.320
It was probably one of those things because the record was for Orange Lounge Radio.

02:17:24.320 --> 02:17:25.600
Then they see that as a business.

02:17:25.680 --> 02:17:29.680
And so they probably want the money or whatever, as opposed to, you know, Dark Soccer.

02:17:29.680 --> 02:17:30.800
I know, I know.

02:17:30.800 --> 02:17:33.440
I'm going to actually see if I can put in an appeal.

02:17:33.440 --> 02:17:34.080
All right.

02:17:34.080 --> 02:17:37.120
But anyway, we wanted to just give people the update on that.

02:17:37.120 --> 02:17:39.680
And so I know that is like a bummer type of thing.

02:17:39.680 --> 02:17:41.920
And I see that in chat, but here's the thing.

02:17:42.720 --> 02:17:44.720
I don't need Guinness to acknowledge the show.

02:17:44.720 --> 02:17:46.160
It'll be, it'll be nice if they did.

02:17:48.480 --> 02:17:50.000
But nice for a tagline.

02:17:50.000 --> 02:17:50.640
Yes.

02:17:50.640 --> 02:17:52.400
Yeah, it would be a great selling point, wouldn't it?

02:17:52.400 --> 02:17:53.920
But it'd be nice.

02:17:53.920 --> 02:17:57.360
But what Fat Ninja DM just shared with us.

02:17:58.000 --> 02:17:59.120
That's really the best.

02:17:59.120 --> 02:18:02.960
That's way more, that was more important than a Guinness World Record.

02:18:04.000 --> 02:18:05.760
That is far more important than that.

02:18:05.760 --> 02:18:06.960
So thank you so much.

02:18:06.960 --> 02:18:09.440
And it's only marginally better than actually having a Guinness.

02:18:10.560 --> 02:18:10.880
Kidding.

02:18:10.880 --> 02:18:11.200
Kidding.

02:18:11.200 --> 02:18:11.840
That was great.

02:18:11.840 --> 02:18:14.960
It was really, it was really, no, no, no, no.

02:18:15.920 --> 02:18:17.360
Fat Ninja understands.

02:18:17.360 --> 02:18:18.160
All right.

02:18:18.160 --> 02:18:19.120
Right, right, right.

02:18:19.760 --> 02:18:20.320
All right.

02:18:20.320 --> 02:18:20.800
Okay.

02:18:20.800 --> 02:18:23.280
Which I have one in my fridge, so hey, winner.

02:18:23.280 --> 02:18:23.840
All right.

02:18:24.560 --> 02:18:25.280
Take care of my friend.

02:18:25.280 --> 02:18:26.320
Thank you so much for the call.

02:18:26.320 --> 02:18:26.960
I really appreciate it.

02:18:26.960 --> 02:18:27.760
Thank you.

02:18:27.760 --> 02:18:28.160
All right.

02:18:28.160 --> 02:18:28.480
Okay.

02:18:28.480 --> 02:18:29.200
No problem.

02:18:29.200 --> 02:18:30.000
You take care of my friend.

02:18:30.000 --> 02:18:30.880
Have fun in New World.

02:18:31.680 --> 02:18:32.080
All right.

02:18:32.080 --> 02:18:32.320
Thank you.

02:18:32.320 --> 02:18:32.560
All right.

02:18:32.560 --> 02:18:33.060
Later.

02:18:34.000 --> 02:18:34.720
That was very nice.

02:18:34.720 --> 02:18:36.480
Don't we, don't we appreciate those type of calls?

02:18:36.480 --> 02:18:37.200
Thank you so much.

02:18:37.200 --> 02:18:38.320
Absolutely.

02:18:38.320 --> 02:18:39.040
Yeah.

02:18:39.040 --> 02:18:43.360
Orange right in chat says Orange Launch Radio was already declared best podcast in the galaxy.

02:18:43.360 --> 02:18:44.080
That is true.

02:18:44.080 --> 02:18:45.280
You know, here's the thing.

02:18:46.240 --> 02:18:52.400
All we have to do is set up a front to give out world records and say that we do have the world

02:18:52.400 --> 02:18:52.880
record.

02:18:52.880 --> 02:18:55.680
We just can't say it's a Guinness world record.

02:18:56.800 --> 02:18:57.680
There's a difference.

02:18:58.960 --> 02:19:00.720
And I'm still going to fight him.

02:19:00.720 --> 02:19:02.400
No, you should.

02:19:02.400 --> 02:19:06.960
And if we have to look into paying to be recognized as a group, then let's talk about it.

02:19:06.960 --> 02:19:09.440
If it's not a horrible amount of money.

02:19:09.440 --> 02:19:12.000
The OLR Kickstarter make us famous.

02:19:13.040 --> 02:19:15.840
If depending on what we're just infamous right now.

02:19:15.840 --> 02:19:16.240
You know what?

02:19:16.240 --> 02:19:20.160
Depending on what we're talking about, maybe we can just chip or I can just chip in whatever.

02:19:20.160 --> 02:19:20.720
We'll work it out.

02:19:21.280 --> 02:19:22.640
It really isn't supposed to be that bad.

02:19:23.680 --> 02:19:24.000
All right.

02:19:24.000 --> 02:19:25.200
Anyway, anyway.

02:19:26.160 --> 02:19:26.880
I was going to ask.

02:19:26.880 --> 02:19:28.480
So you'd gone AFK at our soccer.

02:19:28.480 --> 02:19:31.520
But I think I think there's no email, right?

02:19:31.520 --> 02:19:32.880
So I just empty.

02:19:32.880 --> 02:19:33.200
Yeah.

02:19:33.200 --> 02:19:35.600
Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

02:19:35.600 --> 02:19:37.520
If you want to send us an email for a future week.

02:19:37.520 --> 02:19:42.080
Again, that's participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com because we didn't have any emails.

02:19:43.040 --> 02:19:45.520
Let's check for any last minute stories from Loki.

02:19:46.640 --> 02:19:47.440
Not a whole lot.

02:19:47.440 --> 02:19:52.560
It's mainly just there was a story about and it's predictable because they do this for

02:19:52.560 --> 02:20:00.160
everything that Roblox creators were creating knockoffs of the games that were in squid game.

02:20:00.800 --> 02:20:04.320
And so that's been like the new hotness recently on Roblox.

02:20:04.320 --> 02:20:05.920
But they do that with everything.

02:20:05.920 --> 02:20:07.680
They knock off every single thing on there.

02:20:07.680 --> 02:20:09.760
There's no IP that is safe.

02:20:09.760 --> 02:20:10.160
Hold on.

02:20:11.360 --> 02:20:11.840
I need something.

02:20:11.840 --> 02:20:12.240
Okay.

02:20:12.240 --> 02:20:15.360
So we do these silly little intros at the top of each show.

02:20:15.360 --> 02:20:17.120
Those that listen live, you see it.

02:20:18.000 --> 02:20:21.840
You can't do that on television where, you know, such and such will not be seen tonight.

02:20:22.720 --> 02:20:24.320
So Loki did the one tonight.

02:20:24.320 --> 02:20:25.440
Thank you for doing that, Loki.

02:20:25.440 --> 02:20:30.160
And it was a play on squid game where you incorporated the Splatoon characters into it.

02:20:30.160 --> 02:20:34.240
But I've been hearing all about this fucking show and I know

02:20:34.880 --> 02:20:39.920
nothing about it except that it's Korean and on Netflix without spoiling it.

02:20:40.640 --> 02:20:44.480
Because I've heard that you should kind of not know what it's about when you want.

02:20:44.480 --> 02:20:48.560
But so I'm giving you the difficult task without spoiling it.

02:20:48.560 --> 02:20:51.360
What is this show and why is it so popular?

02:20:51.360 --> 02:20:59.200
So the premise is there are these people that have been approached and invited to participate

02:20:59.200 --> 02:21:02.800
in this contest or game, basically.

02:21:02.800 --> 02:21:08.800
And so they get these cards and they meet up at a certain spot and they're basically

02:21:08.800 --> 02:21:14.080
blindfolded and knocked out and brought to this place to play these games.

02:21:14.080 --> 02:21:18.880
And the games basically what happens is there's like, I think, 456 people.

02:21:19.760 --> 02:21:23.520
They have like so much money per person and it's the last one.

02:21:24.320 --> 02:21:26.320
Last one standing gets all of the money.

02:21:26.320 --> 02:21:27.600
It's a lot of money.

02:21:27.600 --> 02:21:32.640
A lot of these people have like lots of debt that they owe to like, you know,

02:21:32.640 --> 02:21:34.800
bad people or something like that.

02:21:34.800 --> 02:21:39.760
And so the premise is, though, what they don't know going into it is that

02:21:40.400 --> 02:21:43.840
if you lose the game, you die, you get killed.

02:21:43.920 --> 02:21:46.000
And so it's battle royale.

02:21:46.000 --> 02:21:48.880
It's sort of battle royale, but it's them do it.

02:21:48.880 --> 02:21:52.000
Like, for example, what was shown in there is the first game.

02:21:52.560 --> 02:21:58.160
They're playing children game like children, a Korean children's school games, I guess.

02:21:58.160 --> 02:22:00.160
So red light, green light, basically.

02:22:00.160 --> 02:22:04.640
But there's this creepy doll head thing or this giant doll that's, you know, doing the

02:22:04.640 --> 02:22:05.600
red light, green light stuff.

02:22:05.600 --> 02:22:07.840
And if they catch you moving, they shoot you.

02:22:08.560 --> 02:22:11.280
So it's very interesting.

02:22:11.280 --> 02:22:13.120
So there's a lot of these different games.

02:22:13.120 --> 02:22:14.560
So it's arcades murder world.

02:22:16.400 --> 02:22:18.480
I don't know, but yeah, it's very good.

02:22:18.480 --> 02:22:20.240
It's an interesting drama.

02:22:20.240 --> 02:22:23.280
And they have like basically certain rules that are followed in there.

02:22:23.280 --> 02:22:27.520
No one reveals who their identities are in.

02:22:27.520 --> 02:22:31.680
It's just kind of all these different characters that they follow through this and like just

02:22:31.680 --> 02:22:33.360
their experiences with that.

02:22:33.360 --> 02:22:34.720
So it's interesting.

02:22:36.720 --> 02:22:37.440
All right.

02:22:37.440 --> 02:22:37.600
Yeah.

02:22:37.600 --> 02:22:39.040
And I see folks in chat.

02:22:39.040 --> 02:22:39.840
They're saying, let's see.

02:22:39.840 --> 02:22:43.120
I think it was Orange Wright said it's battle royale, but Korean.

02:22:43.760 --> 02:22:46.240
Mike Deff says it's battle royale, but they don't kill each other.

02:22:46.240 --> 02:22:47.680
That's not necessarily true.

02:22:47.680 --> 02:22:48.180
But yeah.

02:22:49.520 --> 02:22:51.600
I'm going to go with the Marvel analogy.

02:22:51.600 --> 02:22:52.400
It's murder world.

02:22:53.360 --> 02:22:56.160
I did ask for the simple version, so I'm OK with that.

02:22:56.880 --> 02:22:59.840
Anyway, quickly, I don't know if you want to say anything else on the Roblox thing,

02:22:59.840 --> 02:23:02.800
Loki, but I want to look at some other comments in chat.

02:23:02.800 --> 02:23:07.200
Darth Tetsuya is saying in chat, if you can pick up Cruise and Blast, do it.

02:23:07.200 --> 02:23:08.800
It's super fun for a budget title.

02:23:08.800 --> 02:23:11.040
I played it for two weeks straight, unlocking everything.

02:23:11.040 --> 02:23:13.920
And Orange Wright kind of seconded that comment in our chat.

02:23:14.480 --> 02:23:16.960
Yeah, I keep I keep forgetting that that's out.

02:23:16.960 --> 02:23:18.480
And I do want to pick it up at some point.

02:23:18.480 --> 02:23:19.040
That's for sure.

02:23:19.040 --> 02:23:21.440
Also, Hot Wheels Unleashed is apparently pretty good.

02:23:21.440 --> 02:23:24.560
I haven't gotten that yet, but that's also very good, too.

02:23:25.520 --> 02:23:28.800
SHO 100 Matt is saying we should get a Wikipedia page up again.

02:23:28.800 --> 02:23:32.320
Been a while since there was one after some clown got the OLR one deleted.

02:23:33.600 --> 02:23:37.280
I would love if we had a Wikipedia article again, but of course, it's just going to get

02:23:37.280 --> 02:23:42.560
deleted unless you have to be able to reference external sources to establish the

02:23:42.560 --> 02:23:43.760
notability of the show.

02:23:43.760 --> 02:23:48.320
I think, yeah, I think there are some out there like you got to do like some of the

02:23:49.680 --> 02:23:53.040
well, first, the fact that we won the first podcast award for gaming and that we're still

02:23:53.040 --> 02:23:54.400
going, there's that.

02:23:54.400 --> 02:23:55.760
But what would really help?

02:23:55.760 --> 02:23:57.600
Here's what would really help SHO 100 Matt.

02:23:59.200 --> 02:24:03.040
I don't know how to phrase this without sounding like ego, so I'm just going to say it bluntly.

02:24:03.920 --> 02:24:10.400
We need more coverage in like gaming press, gaming media about the accomplishments that

02:24:10.400 --> 02:24:15.280
we've done as we're getting into our 20th year of doing OLR, because the more write

02:24:15.280 --> 02:24:20.000
ups we can get from those type of external sources, that's how we get a Wikipedia page

02:24:20.000 --> 02:24:22.320
again, because then there'll be external sources to cite.

02:24:22.320 --> 02:24:23.600
Does that make sense?

02:24:23.600 --> 02:24:30.160
It can't just be like, oh, 10 years ago we spilled the beans on Beautiful Katamari, you

02:24:30.160 --> 02:24:33.200
know, and Guitar Hero rocks the 80s or whatever it was.

02:24:33.840 --> 02:24:34.800
We can't like that.

02:24:34.800 --> 02:24:37.200
That's not going to be strong enough to hold a Wikipedia page for us.

02:24:38.560 --> 02:24:45.280
I still kind of think that the fact that we're the longest running show, but unfortunately

02:24:45.280 --> 02:24:48.800
we don't have anything to really back that up like a Guinness World Record or whatever.

02:24:48.800 --> 02:24:53.680
But if we had an article about us that called us the longest running show, then you can

02:24:53.680 --> 02:24:54.720
kind of reference that.

02:24:54.720 --> 02:24:56.560
Do you see where I'm going with that SHO 100 Matt?

02:24:56.560 --> 02:24:59.680
That's and everybody, I don't mean to pick on you, but that's the sort of stuff that

02:24:59.680 --> 02:25:00.400
we kind of need.

02:25:00.400 --> 02:25:03.760
And then a Wikipedia page can happen again because you'll have those sort of sources.

02:25:04.800 --> 02:25:05.040
Yeah.

02:25:05.040 --> 02:25:07.840
And as Bobby Blackwell says, right now, we're not notable enough.

02:25:08.480 --> 02:25:14.880
I think the fact we won the first podcast award and we're still here ought to say something.

02:25:17.440 --> 02:25:21.360
But it doesn't it has to get that's hard to explain to people.

02:25:21.360 --> 02:25:21.840
It's hard.

02:25:21.840 --> 02:25:22.640
Oh, wow.

02:25:22.640 --> 02:25:24.800
2005 podcast award.

02:25:24.800 --> 02:25:25.440
Wow, wow, wow.

02:25:25.440 --> 02:25:28.480
It's on cam right now if you're watching live.

02:25:28.480 --> 02:25:31.280
Well, we know it's and it's if you Google it, you'll find it.

02:25:31.280 --> 02:25:32.000
It's documented.

02:25:32.000 --> 02:25:34.640
I ironically, here's the thing that gets me.

02:25:34.640 --> 02:25:40.240
Ironically, there is a Wikipedia page for the podcast awards and we're listed on there.

02:25:40.240 --> 02:25:45.680
And like every podcast in that matrix that's ever won an award has an article somewhere.

02:25:47.040 --> 02:25:49.520
Except like one or two, and we're one of them.

02:25:49.520 --> 02:25:51.920
So to make us an artist.

02:25:51.920 --> 02:25:52.320
Yeah.

02:25:52.320 --> 02:25:52.960
Anyway.

02:25:52.960 --> 02:25:57.200
But I don't want to turn this into a woe is me segment because, you know, again, we can

02:25:57.200 --> 02:25:58.160
sit here, bitch, wine, moan.

02:25:58.160 --> 02:25:58.640
We don't have this.

02:25:58.640 --> 02:25:59.200
We don't have this.

02:25:59.200 --> 02:25:59.760
We don't have this.

02:25:59.760 --> 02:26:00.720
You know what we do have?

02:26:01.760 --> 02:26:02.960
That last call we just had.

02:26:03.760 --> 02:26:04.320
Yeah.

02:26:04.320 --> 02:26:05.600
And that's great.

02:26:05.600 --> 02:26:07.440
Far more important than a Wikipedia page.

02:26:08.240 --> 02:26:08.960
Heck yeah.

02:26:08.960 --> 02:26:09.460
Heck yeah.

02:26:10.880 --> 02:26:15.040
Anyhow, on that note, I think we will wrap things up unless there's another last minute

02:26:15.040 --> 02:26:16.800
story you're dying to get out, Logie.

02:26:16.800 --> 02:26:22.000
I'm just reporting that remember how they did it like a boy in the blob kind of remaster

02:26:22.000 --> 02:26:23.200
remake or something like that.

02:26:23.200 --> 02:26:24.080
That was on the Wii.

02:26:24.080 --> 02:26:25.200
That's coming to the Switch now.

02:26:25.760 --> 02:26:26.320
That's about it.

02:26:26.320 --> 02:26:26.880
Oh, yeah.

02:26:27.200 --> 02:26:28.160
Oh, interesting.

02:26:29.040 --> 02:26:30.080
Yeah, it looked pretty cool.

02:26:30.080 --> 02:26:32.880
It was like a kind of hand drawn animated stuff.

02:26:32.880 --> 02:26:34.320
So it looked pretty cool.

02:26:36.080 --> 02:26:39.280
It's kind of a random thing to dig out of the archives, but all right, we'll take it.

02:26:39.920 --> 02:26:40.640
That's for sure.

02:26:40.640 --> 02:26:41.140
Yeah.

02:26:41.840 --> 02:26:42.340
All right.

02:26:44.320 --> 02:26:47.200
Let's wrap it up with our final thoughts and good night.

02:26:47.200 --> 02:26:49.760
I know Dark Soccer is one to get to her stream.

02:26:49.760 --> 02:26:54.240
But before I go to Dark Soccer for her final thought, I will say thank you, of course,

02:26:54.240 --> 02:26:58.480
for participating with Orange Lounge Radio this week, whether you did it live here on

02:26:58.480 --> 02:27:02.720
Sunday night over on Twitch at VOG Network, thank you for that, or if it was listening

02:27:02.720 --> 02:27:03.520
on the podcast feed.

02:27:03.520 --> 02:27:06.560
I know some of you do that and then you kind of share your thoughts on Discord throughout

02:27:06.560 --> 02:27:08.320
the week or via Twitter or whatever.

02:27:08.320 --> 02:27:09.600
So thank you for that.

02:27:09.600 --> 02:27:12.400
However you participated with the show, appreciate you.

02:27:12.400 --> 02:27:15.760
And all we ask, tell a friend or two about the show.

02:27:16.400 --> 02:27:18.240
Tip off a few media sites.

02:27:18.240 --> 02:27:22.080
Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice, but we

02:27:22.080 --> 02:27:24.000
need to get the voices here to get them out on air.

02:27:24.960 --> 02:27:29.040
A nice five-star review on iTunes or wherever it is you found this podcast.

02:27:29.040 --> 02:27:31.600
All of that stuff goes an awful long way.

02:27:31.600 --> 02:27:36.000
If you are so inclined and you'd like to show a little love through some merch purchasing,

02:27:36.000 --> 02:27:40.160
then I suggest you visit our shop, vognetwork.com slash shop.

02:27:40.160 --> 02:27:44.640
And you can check out an Orange Lounge Radio t-shirt or a VOG Network t-shirt or a Bobby

02:27:44.640 --> 02:27:46.640
Black Wolf mug, an OLR sticker.

02:27:46.640 --> 02:27:48.560
There's a lot of stuff up there that you can check out.

02:27:48.560 --> 02:27:50.720
That is all at vognetwork.com slash shop.

02:27:51.440 --> 02:27:52.560
But you certainly don't have to.

02:27:53.200 --> 02:27:55.440
Um, that is it for me.

02:27:55.440 --> 02:27:57.520
Let's go around and get final thoughts.

02:27:57.520 --> 02:27:59.120
And Dark Sakura, I will start with you.

02:28:00.640 --> 02:28:03.120
Be kind to yourself and be kind to each other.

02:28:03.120 --> 02:28:04.240
It's easy to be kind.

02:28:05.680 --> 02:28:07.920
Don't be a salty shit in Endgame Chat, yo.

02:28:11.520 --> 02:28:14.960
That's when I just leave and don't give them the satisfaction of a reply.

02:28:15.840 --> 02:28:19.280
I've been actually taking to do the, oh, and one more thing.

02:28:19.280 --> 02:28:21.680
And the Miss Barn approach.

02:28:21.760 --> 02:28:24.160
Oh, oh, I saw somebody else do that.

02:28:24.160 --> 02:28:26.560
I don't know if it was Nick or losing color or somebody.

02:28:26.560 --> 02:28:27.600
I think it was losing color.

02:28:27.600 --> 02:28:28.800
Did the whole like chat.

02:28:28.800 --> 02:28:31.120
Oh, and one more thing and then left the room.

02:28:31.920 --> 02:28:34.080
And then the thing in chat was barned.

02:28:34.080 --> 02:28:35.840
That was so fucking funny.

02:28:37.040 --> 02:28:37.520
That's great.

02:28:37.520 --> 02:28:38.080
Yes.

02:28:38.080 --> 02:28:38.720
And it works.

02:28:39.440 --> 02:28:41.680
You can use that outside dead by daylight.

02:28:41.680 --> 02:28:45.200
Use that in whatever game is having a chat that's pissing you off.

02:28:45.200 --> 02:28:46.080
Just let them know.

02:28:46.080 --> 02:28:46.720
You know what?

02:28:46.720 --> 02:28:48.720
And one more thing and then leave.

02:28:48.720 --> 02:28:51.280
And then if they'll just be waiting for an answer.

02:28:52.400 --> 02:28:53.280
And you own them.

02:28:53.280 --> 02:28:53.680
All right.

02:28:53.680 --> 02:28:56.240
Anyway, thank you to our Sakura and have a good stream tonight.

02:28:56.880 --> 02:28:57.120
All right.

02:28:57.120 --> 02:28:58.080
Thank you.

02:28:58.080 --> 02:28:58.580
All right.

02:28:59.360 --> 02:29:00.960
And then my final thought for the night.

02:29:01.920 --> 02:29:02.240
Let's see.

02:29:02.240 --> 02:29:03.520
I don't know if I have a lot to say.

02:29:03.520 --> 02:29:08.080
I'm just going to, I will reiterate what I said earlier with my well wishes for Bobby

02:29:08.080 --> 02:29:09.840
Blackwolf and we hope to see you back here.

02:29:10.720 --> 02:29:12.880
Sunday nights are going to be very strange without you.

02:29:12.880 --> 02:29:14.400
If it's just one week, then whatever.

02:29:14.400 --> 02:29:15.360
Bobby's on vacation.

02:29:16.240 --> 02:29:19.680
But it's going to be very weird if it goes on for any longer.

02:29:19.760 --> 02:29:27.840
So but obviously everything is that you're doing is more important than the show.

02:29:27.840 --> 02:29:30.400
So I get it.

02:29:30.400 --> 02:29:30.900
All right.

02:29:31.840 --> 02:29:33.680
Last but not least, Loki.

02:29:34.720 --> 02:29:37.440
I'm hoping to have my video out this week.

02:29:37.440 --> 02:29:40.800
I was hoping to have it out last week and that took forever.

02:29:40.800 --> 02:29:47.600
So I'm still fighting, trying to get content to a manageable amount.

02:29:47.600 --> 02:29:49.760
They can film in a week and turn around in a week.

02:29:49.760 --> 02:29:50.400
You can do it.

02:29:50.400 --> 02:29:51.200
I believe in you.

02:29:52.000 --> 02:29:52.560
Yeah.

02:29:52.560 --> 02:29:55.360
All right, that's going to do it for another episode of OLR.

02:29:55.360 --> 02:29:57.600
We will be back in seven days.

02:29:57.600 --> 02:30:00.400
We're going to know the next Smash Brothers character in seven days.

02:30:00.400 --> 02:30:03.440
We're going to have a new Metroid game in the next seven days.

02:30:03.440 --> 02:30:04.480
This is a busy week.

02:30:04.480 --> 02:30:06.400
Welcome to the fourth quarter, everybody.

02:30:06.400 --> 02:30:07.600
It's going to be a fun year.

02:30:07.600 --> 02:30:10.400
We'll see you next time to talk about the latest and greatest in gaming with all of

02:30:10.400 --> 02:30:11.760
you and your voices.

02:30:11.760 --> 02:30:12.960
Have a wonderful week.

02:30:12.960 --> 02:30:13.360
Good night.
