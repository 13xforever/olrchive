0	14860	This week, Facebook's outage made its managed games and apps, including Oculus, unplayable,
14860	18680	Sony is ending the PS3 and Vita's digital marketplace again, and the accessible games
18680	22880	database received wide coverage, hopefully cementing its place as a de facto guide.
22880	24260	Why is that last one included?
24260	28700	Because its need to exist is depressing to consider, but so beneficial that it does.
28700	31860	These are just a few of the galvanizing stories of the week, now it's time for your hosts,
31860	34980	Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to talk about them and the rest of the week's gaming
34980	37860	news, starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.
37860	46740	Hello my friends out there on the internet, welcome back to another week of the show where
46740	48140	every gamer has a voice.
48140	55620	It is Orange Lounge Radio and we are live once again with episode number 887 of our
55620	59420	show for tonight, October the 10th of 2021.
59420	63780	My name is Rob Roberts and I'm here with you every week, along with my co-hosts.
63780	67580	Say hello over there to Jamie Summers, DarkSakura, how are you?
67580	69020	I'm wrapping up a pink drink.
69020	70020	A pink drink?
70020	71020	Oh, yum, yum.
71020	72020	Those are, those are...
72020	73020	I thought that was supposed to be...
73020	74260	This is what's left of it.
74260	79620	I thought those were supposed to be like a limited time thing and then it ended up sticking
79620	80780	around for a long time.
80780	89220	So it was an off, it was actually an off menu item, like a secret menu item.
89220	90220	Got it.
90220	93900	And it's been incorporated into the new reality of Starbucks.
93900	96680	Well, I have coffee, but it's just boring old.
96680	100380	I use my little machine to make the coffee, but I have backup soda.
100380	103340	It's an important part of getting through tonight's show.
103340	104900	Also with tech master, Loki.
104900	105900	Hello.
105900	106900	Hi, Loki.
106900	107900	How are you?
107900	108900	I'm doing all right.
108900	110980	What are you playing behind you tonight?
110980	111980	CarnEvil.
111980	112980	CarnEvil.
112980	113980	Okay.
113980	114980	That was, I'm like, wait a minute.
114980	115980	He switched.
115980	116980	It was like Donkey Kong beforehand or something.
116980	117980	He switched it.
117980	118980	That was last week.
118980	119980	I have the...
119980	120980	Oh, okay.
120980	121980	Oh yes.
121980	122980	A little variety is good.
122980	123980	Yes, it is.
123980	128860	Hey, if the topic of food here on this program, which sometimes I would say we get criticized
128860	132260	for talking about food too much on this program, but that actually doesn't happen.
132260	135500	That's just me trying to keep things on topic sometimes I think.
135620	140900	For those of you guys that are excited about a food talk, I have some good news.
140900	144400	We do tape live every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern at the
144400	148780	Voice of Geeks Network, live at Twitch TV, twitch.tv slash vog network.
148780	149860	If you want to join along.
149860	155220	We are usually after the Bobby Black Wolf show, but he is on hiatus for a little bit.
155220	156220	Bobby is doing fine.
156220	157940	I've talked to Bobby.
157940	159860	Bobby's just not ready to be podcasting again.
159860	164460	So stay tuned to our discord for all the details on when the Bobby Black Wolf show will return
164500	167140	at five Pacific eight Eastern right before our show.
167140	171660	Again, our discord is over at twitch, twitch.tv.
171660	177420	How about twitch.tv slash vog network and then vog network.com slash discord.
177420	180380	I do believe Bobby is out there in listener land tonight though.
180380	181380	So hi Bobby.
181380	182380	And I hope you're feeling well.
182380	189200	And on the topic of food last week, I teased, maybe we need to do a bonus stream.
189200	190200	That's just nothing.
190200	194100	Maybe we need to make orange lounge foodie-o a reality.
194100	196060	So I have good news, everybody.
196060	198580	We're going to enable a channel point reward tonight.
198580	202580	And if we can get 100,000 points, which we'll, we'll get those points because we, we did
202580	204680	like 150 for the last one and we got it.
204680	209180	So, but, uh, if you're willing to spend some points, uh, we're going to open it.
209180	210660	Oh yes, Bobby just hit the button.
210660	211880	There we go.
211880	216980	A special orange lounge foodie-o presentation here at vog network where we will talk about
216980	218880	nothing but food.
218880	223340	So dark Sakura can talk about all the pink drinks or other Starbucks drinks she wants.
223340	227180	Loki can talk about all the bacon infused things he's tried lately.
227180	229940	And I will, I will talk about crazy flavored potato chips.
229940	231340	You know, that's a thing for me.
231340	239460	I just had, um, Alan found these at Costco, uh, and it looks really nasty on the cover,
239460	242580	but it's Buffalo chicken flavored lays.
242580	245860	So stay tuned to orange lounge foodie-o to hear more about that.
245860	248620	I see some of you guys in chat donating already.
248620	250580	Thank you guys very much for that.
250580	254540	We're, we're already, wow, we're already over 10% of the way there.
254540	258660	You guys are nuts, but in the best, what are the other special lays right now, Rob, just
258660	260380	out of curiosity, I don't know.
260380	261740	That was the only one that we saw.
261740	263540	I didn't know they put out a new batch.
263540	269820	Um, but it was, it had the label on it called like, um, pre pre get no tailgate favorites.
269820	273860	So they're tying it in with, um, that just doesn't sound delicious.
273860	277780	Not the super bowl, but like, I guess the playoff games and stuff, because baseball
277780	279580	got big stuff, right?
279580	283300	The like other chip flavored lays.
283300	285860	So like Cheetos, Funyuns, and Doritos.
285860	286860	That was the thing.
286860	288020	I think that has already gone.
288020	291660	I think that sometimes those promotions are sometimes blink and you miss it.
291660	294460	And in my opinion, the only good one was the Funyuns.
294460	296900	The others were really under, I thought the Cheetos one was terrible.
296900	301620	Uh, but anyway, I didn't even know there were Funyun ones.
301620	304480	There were, there were, they were wavy, but there, there were all right.
304480	307740	More talk like this on, uh, see, see how easy food.
308740	312820	But it's an important part of a video gaming is the snacks and all that good stuff that
312820	313820	we have.
313820	318220	Uh, so orange launch video coming soon, probably, probably after Halloween, I'd say early November
318220	323100	is a good target time, assuming, I mean, if we raise 20 K points every night, we're going
323100	324140	to be there in no time.
324140	327500	So probably coming to you in early November, we'll set the date soon.
327500	329700	Maybe we can do it on like 19 November or 20 November.
329700	332340	I'll have to check on what days those are, but that would be a lot of fun if it works
332340	333340	up with everybody.
333340	334340	Yeah.
334340	335340	That'd be a lot of fun.
335340	336340	That'd be a special thing to do.
336340	337340	So we'll try.
337940	338940	All right.
339940	340940	Do the thing.
340940	341940	Do the thing.
341940	343940	Uh, I haven't even contributed my own points yet, so I'll do that.
343940	345940	Uh, let's get into some gaming news.
345940	347260	There was a lot going on this week.
347260	349500	We had a special Nintendo direct.
349500	350500	We knew this was coming.
350500	354140	That's the fun thing about doing this show weekly and live is that sometimes at the end
354140	359440	of the show, we're like, Hey, seven days when we're back seven days, but when we're back
359440	363720	here to do it all again in seven days, we're going to know some things that we didn't know
363720	365860	on episode eight 86.
366380	372540	And now we know the complete roster for super smash brothers, ultimate, the last character
372540	375820	was revealed in a special direct, but the news really didn't end there.
375820	376820	Right?
376820	377820	Loki.
377820	378820	We had a lot of stuff, right?
378820	379820	Yes.
379820	384780	So, uh, they announced that yes, the last character in this Nintendo series, absolutely
384780	388480	not missing any Nintendo characters whatsoever.
388480	390260	This is absolutely complete.
390260	391620	Nobody's missing.
391660	396860	But now we have Sora, um, from kingdom hearts in smash brothers.
396860	403300	When he's not canon, that's not canon anymore.
403300	404300	Interesting.
404300	408100	How, so I think it'd actually be a really good character to have.
408100	412820	I, Hey, look, I would have loved Waluigi as well, but like, I get it.
412820	417220	And I I'm not, look, they should have done two characters, then we'd be only expecting
417220	418220	one.
418220	420460	Then this game would never end.
420620	421620	It'd be over.
421620	422620	No, this would be the last.
422620	424660	They just do the last two characters instead.
424660	431020	That way you like, you get everybody hyped up by like, Oh, it's Sora Waluigi Waluigi's
431020	432020	there too.
432020	439220	They have to save somebody for the sequel Sakurai will never sleep again.
439220	440220	I'm just kidding.
440220	441860	Like he sleeps anyway, let's soccer.
441860	443580	I have a fucking vacation.
443580	445180	Send him to Tahiti.
445180	447840	He's deserved it anyway.
447840	452600	So along with the announcement that Sora is going to be in smash brothers, you may be
452600	453600	thinking, well, wait a second.
453600	457440	Kingdom hearts isn't on the switch, but then you'd be wrong because it is now on the switch
457440	458580	or it's going to be coming.
458580	459580	But then you'd be wrong.
459580	465880	Cause it's not really on a cartridge because you have to stream it because the switch can't
465880	467600	run Kingdom hearts.
467600	473080	And so, um, but yeah, you can pay to stream it.
473080	476720	Which is, it's not the first time they've done like control is a cloud game.
476760	480000	And I know in Japan, the cloud based switch gaming has been more popular.
480000	485480	I think there is a bit of surprise out there in the community that Kingdom hearts one and
485480	493520	two HD remix are part of this, that, um, those games ran on a PlayStation three.
493520	496640	So you would think the switch would be capable of those first two games.
496640	501880	Uh, it's just maybe a question of maybe square just didn't want to do it.
501880	504960	Maybe they didn't think they'd sell enough of them to put out the cartridges or I don't
504960	505960	know.
505960	509120	So for whatever reason, uh, they're doing it as a combo cloud path.
509120	510120	Yeah.
510120	511120	It's cool.
511120	512920	You know, Kingdom hearts, this isn't popular at all.
512920	515880	So we're just not going to put out cartridges, but Kingdom hearts is so popular that we're
515880	517880	going to include its character in smash brothers.
517880	523240	Uh, but your contradiction, Bobby black Wolf is in chat to remind you over twitch.tv slash
523240	525880	vog never see, even though he doesn't have a show, he's here to correct you.
525880	528760	Loki, uh, Bobby reminds you that three D S had Kingdom hearts.
528760	531080	It was literally called Kingdom hearts three D yes.
531080	532080	Drop drop.
532080	533080	This is not the switch.
533080	534080	Sorry.
534080	537080	It's, it's not the card.
537080	538880	There was that card game on the Gameboy advance.
538880	543540	I know the three D has had tons of things on it, but the three D S doesn't exist anymore.
543540	544540	It's only the switch.
544540	551960	And so therefore Kingdom hearts on a Nintendo console, not a console it's on a handheld.
551960	553000	Yes.
553000	559120	There's been several Kingdom hearts properties and things like that, but not on an actual
559120	560120	console.
560160	565840	I, it makes as much sense as having cloud and separate off in the lineup do, and it's
565840	566840	fine.
566840	568080	Like I really have no problem with it.
568080	572920	I I'm honestly more surprised, honestly, that they got Sora for it, but at the same time,
572920	573920	they were able to get cloud.
573920	574920	They were able to get separate.
574920	578960	I know we should have seen all this stuff, you know, cloud and separate off both from
578960	579960	Kingdom hearts.
579960	586200	So, I mean, obviously, you know what I mean, Loki, it's like the other big square franchise
586200	593120	that probably, probably has a lot of Venn diagram overlap with Nintendo fans and square
593120	594600	and Nintendo are both well aware.
594600	595600	Agent 47.
595600	596600	Yep.
596600	599800	He would have been a, you know, the next character if they were doing more characters.
599800	602160	I, I honestly think Sora is a fine addition.
602160	603160	I don't know.
603160	606000	I don't know why y'all are hot and bothered Loki it's, it's fine.
606000	607000	It's fine.
607000	608360	I don't care.
608360	610240	I think it's interesting.
610240	614760	You know, there's the Disney side of it too, you know, because Disney has a stake in this.
614760	619800	So I think there's a lot of people that are very interested about the fact that you know,
619800	621280	Disney's allowing this in there.
621280	624860	And some people have noticed some subtle differences.
624860	629520	For example, like the, the stage that they added that has that infamous stained glass
629520	632520	window that's like in the intro to the Kingdom Hearts games.
632520	637360	If you look really carefully, you'll notice Donald and Goofy are not there.
637360	641400	It's they got replaced by more generic types of art, not characters, but like, I think
641400	644200	like one is now a ship and one's a star, whatever.
644200	648560	So Disney very carefully only licensed Sora.
648560	653000	There was a very tongue in cheek sort of tweet that was going around that showed the Mickey
653000	658940	head that's on the Keyblade saying something like this shot probably cost Nintendo more
658940	661560	than actually licensing Sora.
661560	668500	To that I would say that's not going to be true because when you license Sora's likeness,
668500	671400	that Mickey head is part of the Keyblade.
671400	673380	So they licensed that.
673380	678540	And I, you know what, I'm sure a company like Disney had final cut approval on the trailer
678540	680540	and everything in between.
680540	684340	So it didn't, it didn't cost him as much as you think it did.
684340	689260	Nintendo probably went to Disney and Square and said, Hey, you know, our top five selling
689260	691820	game, Super Smash Brothers.
691820	696620	We want to put one of your characters as a paid character in this game.
696620	701460	You literally don't have to do anything, but let us use it in our already established critically
701460	702820	popular game.
702820	707440	And we project based on these projections of other characters, such as Cloud and Sephiroth,
707440	712760	your company will make millions of dollars off this DLC for doing nothing.
712760	715640	How does that sound?
715640	716640	Deal done.
716640	720060	If only they could make that same deal for Super Mario RPG, but I guess that's a whole
720060	723580	other whole other issue.
723580	724580	So there's that.
724580	725580	Um, let's see.
725580	730080	And then, uh, along with that, I was gonna say we also got some Mii Fighter costumes
730080	732180	as well coming and wait, I'm sorry.
732180	733180	I'm sorry.
733180	734180	There's some really, I'm sorry.
734180	735180	I have to read these chat comments that are on topic.
735180	736180	Cause they're really good.
736180	737180	Sorry.
737180	739740	Uh, Bobby Black Wolf says one of those things that I was told a bit ago is that the Mickey
739740	742820	mouse ears are not actually controlled by Disney.
742820	746540	It's the only Disney iconography that they don't control.
746540	747540	That's interesting.
747540	752580	Uh, Jamie, you've been down that rabbit hole more than us is, have you heard that?
752580	753580	Actually yes, I have.
753580	759380	Um, cause I think that's why a lot of independent, um, artists are making like their own mouse
759380	761740	ears, for example, that they can sell them.
761740	772020	I think that the likeness of a mouse ears can't necessarily be trademarked only specific
772020	775340	dimensions of it to use it in purpose as a logo.
775340	776340	Interesting.
776340	777340	Hmm.
777340	778340	Yeah.
778340	781260	I'll have to dig a little bit more into the legalities about it, but I do recall that
781260	783100	having been something.
783100	784100	Yeah.
784100	788300	And, uh, Bobby went to yield Google and found that, uh, they do not own the copyright.
788300	792180	I would have guessed it was tied to that whole, uh, Disney has been deathly afraid
792180	796700	of Mickey going in the public domain for quite some time that they actually have these laws
796700	802500	that they get passed in Congress that they call them Disney laws that basically is extending
802500	806380	the timeframe that intellectual property is held by companies.
806380	810020	And they're, they're, they're basically to prevent Mickey mouse from going public domain
810020	815100	because when that happens, all the Mickey mouse porn will be available.
815100	821460	So thank God that hasn't happened yet because there certainly isn't any Mickey mouse pornography
821460	822700	in the internet.
822700	824040	There's more to it as well.
824040	829060	There's also in terms of generics, like, I don't know if, I mean, a lot, probably a good
829060	833800	number of our listeners may not remember this, but back in the like early eighties, there
833800	838300	used to be this ad going around with showed like a massive copier and said, don't call
838300	844660	it Xeroxing or like, and you hear this more, more often
844660	850300	in Europe, but like vacuuming called hoovering because of the Hoover vacuum.
850300	851300	Yes.
851300	852300	Yeah.
852300	858180	You know, uh, when you put on your, uh, it doesn't matter what the brand it is, you know,
858180	861460	also over there, if you put on your rain boots, you're putting on your wellies.
861460	866500	Well, I think, I think Nintendo, Nintendo's had this problem too, is that everybody's
866500	870460	like, I'm going to go play Nintendo even when it's a Sega Genesis, because people have a
870460	872380	certain age don't know better sometimes.
872380	873380	Right.
873380	874380	Exactly.
874380	882020	But I think that there's also that Mickey mouse in general.
882020	888980	Has also sort of fallen a little bit into that semi generic, but more in terms of description,
888980	893300	you know, like, like, Oh, it's just your Mickey mouse, you know, like talking about a mascot
893300	896060	or a main character.
896060	897060	That's I've heard that.
897060	898060	Yeah.
898060	899060	All right.
899060	900060	Anyway, good, good chat.
900060	903780	It also shed some light on that little tongue in cheek tweet.
903780	907860	So don't believe, I mean, it was a funny tweet, like as, as far as like the humor value.
907860	908860	Great.
908860	911580	But at the same time, don't believe everything you read on social media.
911580	914760	It's not always extremely well-researched right.
914760	915760	I'm sure we knew that.
915760	916760	Anyway.
916760	917760	Uh, and Bobby, Bobby's adding.
917760	919660	I remember when we all used to TiVo things.
919660	920660	Yes.
920660	922460	Even Netflix is a generic now.
922460	923460	Pod culture.
923460	924460	You think about it?
924460	925460	It is.
925460	926460	It kind of is right.
926460	929140	Netflix and chill can still be Disney plus.
929140	932420	In fact, that's Mike's right about Google it.
932420	933420	Yeah.
933420	934420	Yeah.
934420	937780	Rest in peace Bing.
937780	938780	You know what?
938780	939780	I never used Bing.
939780	940780	I hated it.
940780	942860	I used to use one called hot bot.
942860	943860	Hot bot.
943860	944860	Okay.
944860	945860	It's back now.
945860	949780	However, I learned the hard way that if you make a typo, it pulls up porn.
949780	955540	What about, uh, ask Jeeves was what was, what were some of the other Alta Vista Alta Vista.
955540	959260	Oh, I got to put my brain was my jam in like the nineties.
959260	960820	It was another one.
960820	961820	What's that?
961820	962820	Legos.
962820	963820	Oh Yahoo.
963820	964820	Oh yeah.
964820	967860	Well before it was a, uh, I, uh, a place.
967860	970860	I don't know what to call it.
970860	973540	Yahoo is now like the trailer park of the internet.
973540	978420	And I, no offense to, you know, but it's just, you know, it's, it's, it's a place that's
978420	979420	there in the town.
979420	980420	All right.
980420	985100	Uh, anyway, Doug Doug Doug go by the way is a lot more modern I think.
985100	989420	So I don't know that it can be thrown into the, the realm yet.
989420	990420	Lycos.
990420	991420	That was the one I was trying to think of.
991420	992420	Anyway.
992420	993420	All right.
993420	996460	And I just used AOL back in the day cause I had a free account.
996460	999100	So all of my stuff was AOL.
999100	1000100	Back in the day.
1000100	1001100	Ooh.
1001100	1002100	Okay.
1002100	1003100	Sj 100 Matt with your next trivia night question.
1003100	1005980	And then Loki, I swear we'll go back to you for the other news that was announced.
1005980	1011260	Um, Sj 100 Matt says, what about the time that Disney traded a human being for one of
1011260	1012620	their properties?
1012620	1019460	They traded sportscaster contract, Al Michaels from ABC to NBC for the Oswald, the rabbit
1019460	1024860	trademark Oswald was made when Walt worked for universal and Disney wanted it because
1024860	1027360	it was the one property they didn't own.
1027360	1031300	And hello, that ties back to gaming Epic Mickey too, where that was a, you know, Oswald was
1031300	1033080	a huge plot device in that.
1033080	1035760	So I'm fascinating.
1035760	1036760	I didn't know.
1036760	1040340	I, I mean like now that you mentioned that, like I probably did know that, but I forgot
1040340	1041340	it.
1041340	1042340	So yeah, that seems to track.
1043060	1044060	Yeah, it tracks.
1044060	1045060	Exactly.
1045060	1046060	All right.
1046060	1050740	Uh, Loki, now we can go back to, uh, the, uh, direct news.
1050740	1051740	I guess.
1051740	1056860	I mean, so we can talk about copyright if you want more, uh, me fighters that have been,
1056860	1060260	uh, or DLC for me fighters that have been released as well.
1060260	1064060	So they had a Splatoon inspired Octaline.
1064060	1068780	And then of course the one that everybody's really excited about was the doom Slayer.
1068780	1071300	So now he can finally get that match up.
1071300	1081060	And um, they also had, uh, let's say, uh, Judd, which I guess is a referee kitten.
1081060	1082060	I don't know.
1082060	1083060	I don't play a splatoon.
1083060	1084060	Oh, yeah.
1084060	1085060	Oh yeah.
1085060	1089700	At the end of every stage that, that fat little kitty that comes out and waves the flag saying
1089700	1093940	who won is the little meter goes that it's that it's that thing.
1093940	1094940	Yeah.
1094940	1095940	Yeah.
1096100	1103020	Those were the, uh, the things you can buy for 75 cents, 75 whole cents.
1103020	1108020	You know what though, for the doom guy versus, uh, Isabelle matchup, it's worth it.
1108020	1113060	And all the doom fans hoping that that would be the last character are having a sad because
1113060	1114980	all you get is the me, but you know what?
1114980	1117420	They threw a lot of stuff was actually on the console.
1117420	1120740	So, you know, there's that they threw a lot of stuff into the me's though.
1120740	1122740	I remember undertale was all in there too.
1122740	1123740	And that was a big deal.
1123740	1127220	I think of how many more characters we could have gotten if they didn't include fire emblem
1127220	1128220	into that.
1128220	1130940	It's like 80 characters right there.
1130940	1133100	Some people kind of like fire emblem though.
1133100	1139740	So you get one like everybody else you've had your one, maybe two, maybe two, maybe
1139740	1140740	two.
1140740	1144900	And you can get some like shadow fighters or something like that, where you have like
1144900	1149340	80 different, you know, uh, they're the same character, but they look different, you know,
1149340	1153380	type of thing, you know, that's what I'm surprised we didn't get more of.
1153380	1156300	But then again, that's also kind of the me's in a way.
1156300	1164580	So I'm, I think, look, as much as I liked, I'm not saying this in a way to be shady Smash
1164580	1165580	Brothers.
1165580	1167060	It's an iconic game.
1167060	1171180	It is legendary status, especially in tournament and competitive scenes and all this stuff.
1171180	1175860	All that being said, it's time for the life cycle of this game to come to a close.
1175860	1179420	Like it's, it's been the headline for years and years now.
1179420	1180420	It's time.
1180420	1183340	It's time to let Sakurai take a nap.
1183340	1184340	Go on a nice trip.
1184340	1186600	There's more people working on it than just Sakurai.
1186600	1187600	That's true.
1187600	1189940	They can move on to another game.
1189940	1194380	Like honestly, hello, I'd like a new Kid Icarus if they'd like to go back to that, but you
1194380	1195380	know what?
1195380	1199500	Sakurai's earned the right to do whatever period the fuck he wants, period.
1199500	1203060	You're telling me that no one could come up with characters for Smash Brothers other than
1203060	1204060	Sakurai?
1204060	1205940	I mean, that seems a little ridiculous to me.
1205940	1208020	But that team and that group.
1208620	1209620	Okay.
1209620	1210620	Yeah.
1210620	1211620	They have a good team, but other people can do that.
1211620	1216420	I mean, if it was easy to make a Smash Brothers game, Nickelodeon, Nicktoons, Smash might
1216420	1218380	play a little better.
1218380	1221380	It does play pretty well.
1221380	1223500	All right.
1223500	1228720	Anyway, um, SSG100Matt says, you say these things, Rob, but the Smash community still
1228720	1230220	won't let Melee go.
1230220	1231220	And that's okay.
1231220	1233800	I won't let Final Fantasy 6 go.
1233800	1236780	And I know they're doing these pixel remasters and I don't care.
1236780	1239660	A good video game never has to go away.
1239660	1242500	We need a 3D remaster of 6.
1242500	1243500	That would be amazing.
1243500	1245180	A la like 7.
1245180	1250940	Even if the systems fade out and you don't get to buy the system anymore, that's why
1250940	1253600	we have emulators and all that good stuff.
1253600	1254600	Remember this point.
1254600	1257020	It's going to be relevant again later in the show.
1257020	1262580	Anyhow, for now, anything else out of that direct that you want to mention, Logi?
1262580	1263580	Nope.
1263580	1264580	That's it.
1264580	1265580	Nope.
1265580	1266580	All right.
1266580	1270780	The Doom Slayer DLC, that Mii costume actually comes out on the 18th.
1270780	1274180	So we've got a little bit of time still for that next week.
1274180	1275460	All right.
1275460	1276460	Okay.
1276460	1277460	Let us move on.
1277460	1280660	We're going to go to our gaming weeks and talk about the types of video games that we
1280660	1282180	have been playing this week.
1282180	1287220	Actually, Dark Soccer, before we get specifically into your gaming week, um, you've been very
1287220	1290020	in and all about the Twitch culture lately.
1290020	1292620	So there's a couple of things I wanted to ask you about.
1293260	1297860	Number one, you're doing another big marathon tomorrow, but this is unlike the last one
1297860	1298860	you did.
1298860	1300480	This is a charity related thing, right?
1300480	1304420	So I know you plugged it on last week's show, but since it is tomorrow night, give a, give
1304420	1307340	a good old plug for what you're doing tomorrow.
1307340	1311620	So, um, I am doing a 12 or more hour marathon.
1311620	1312620	It depends.
1312620	1319460	Um, my dear friend, Barbara, um, who is one of the people who practically raised me, I
1319540	1323980	adult raised me, um, when I was in college, took really good care of me.
1323980	1329780	Um, her and Maggie, um, has, uh, recently been diagnosed with cancer.
1329780	1336700	Um, it sounds like it's aggressive, um, but, uh, she's already undergoing treatment and
1336700	1347260	I wanted to, um, uh, try to help, uh, sponsor, uh, some of that, uh, treatment by, uh, promoting
1347260	1348740	her go fund me.
1348740	1354860	Um, so what I'm doing, and if you give me just a brief moment, let me get, uh, a link
1354860	1356340	to that real quick.
1356340	1363980	Um, because I am, uh, doing a marathon with, uh, goals.
1363980	1369320	So my first, you know, the first one is like, if I raise a hundred bucks, then, you know,
1369320	1375380	you get something, uh, you know, I'll, I'll do like, let people choose my killer or something
1375380	1377180	in dead by daylight.
1377180	1381620	Um, if, hold on, here's the, here's the link to my tweet.
1381620	1388380	I put it in, uh, and the tweet is actually a, uh, um, what's the word pinned pin tweet
1388380	1390860	on my profile, just a at dark Sakura.
1390860	1393260	Um, but I'm going to be doing some rewards.
1393260	1397720	I'm also going to be doing some giveaways, uh, for some of my merch, like the death hook
1397720	1399700	for cutie stuff.
1399700	1406340	Um, but my goal is to try to raise, I want to at least like, see if I can throw in a
1406340	1408660	grand, you know, cancer treatment is not cheap.
1408660	1409660	Sure.
1409660	1416580	So, um, and I said that if we can hit 5,000, I will play survivor.
1416580	1419140	That's a big goal, but I'm going to wish you well on that.
1419140	1420140	I'll be there.
1420140	1421140	I might lower it.
1421140	1422140	Huh?
1422140	1423140	I might lower it.
1423140	1424140	All right.
1424140	1425140	Well, shoot for the stars.
1425140	1426140	Shoot for the stars.
1426140	1430940	But I am going to end up after a few hours, even though I am making it a redeem.
1430940	1439620	I am planning on doing a couple of kill your friends matches and I might do a survive with
1439620	1440620	friends.
1440620	1444100	Oh, fun as like a bonus or something, you know?
1444100	1450580	So it's not really playing survivor, but it's playing survivor.
1450580	1451580	Makes sense.
1451580	1452580	Yeah, of course.
1453540	1458420	On top of that, I'm planning on inviting a few other streamer friends to participate
1458420	1460500	in some of these matches with me.
1460500	1468260	I do have a semi confirmation from the piggy Ubu, who is like my pig goo best do.
1468260	1474060	And I wanted to, you know, people have been really supportive and have helped me promote
1474060	1480820	like, I actually made friends with the new streamer who put it right in his discord for
1480820	1481820	me.
1481820	1482820	Will Jinkies.
1482820	1483820	Oh, nice.
1483820	1487100	He's working his way toward affiliate right now.
1487100	1491820	Really fun LGBTQ plus streamer.
1491820	1497540	And I've also, you know, a couple of the friends I want to thank.
1497540	1502980	Lapain Tay has said something just, you know, friends have been really supportive.
1502980	1508220	But yeah, I am really looking forward to it.
1508220	1511300	I will link the GoFundMe as well.
1511300	1519780	And if you screenshot for me your donation and link it to me either via discord, a whisper
1519780	1528140	in Twitch or on my private message on my Twitter, then you will, depending on the tier, be entered
1528140	1534180	in for one of the item drawings, one of the giveaways, and your funds will count toward
1534180	1535180	the goals.
1535180	1536180	Awesome.
1536340	1537340	Awesome.
1537340	1538340	Well, good luck.
1538340	1542300	I hope you are able to get a lot of money for a really good cause.
1542300	1543300	Thank you.
1543300	1544300	Yeah.
1544300	1550260	I, Barbara is like one of those people in the world that like seriously means the universe
1550260	1556380	to me like, and I, I, I just want to make things easier.
1556380	1558780	And then another of their roommates may have had a stroke.
1558780	1560840	I don't know yet.
1560840	1568760	So they're in a really tough situation and desperately need, need the help.
1568760	1571600	Before we get to your gaming week, you said, or did you already shout out who you wanted
1571600	1572600	to shout out?
1572600	1575720	I shouted out two people, but I'd like to give another couple of shout outs.
1575720	1576720	Sure.
1576720	1581880	So of course, Will Jinkies, new streamer, awesome person.
1581880	1588280	The Pigu Uwu, who is my piggy bestu, my pigu bestu, I'm sorry.
1588280	1592920	And these are all dead by daylight things for those that don't know what, because out
1592920	1597000	of context could mean something very different, but this is a dead by daylight thing.
1597000	1601560	Just to be clear, if you haven't figured that out about dark soccer by now, she's a fan.
1601560	1612080	Um, uh, empire TV is another, uh, is, uh, um, uh, POC, uh, streamer, uh, really awesome.
1612080	1614160	And in my home state.
1614160	1616360	So I got to share the Alabama love.
1616360	1622280	And then, um, a newer friends, so lingerie and it's spelled exactly like it sounds.
1622280	1628800	So lingerie S O L A N G E R I E, who I made friends with.
1628800	1637760	And I actually, um, put it up on my TikTok, uh, I met, I met them memeing in dead by daylight.
1637760	1643320	It was during the pustule flowers and, uh, their, uh, party was all going around trying
1643320	1645600	to get people to look at the flower with them.
1645840	1646520	I see.
1647120	1652280	And I realized what they were doing and I went in for boops first.
1652280	1653800	I thought they wanted to do a boop match.
1653800	1657520	And then I was like, Oh, the flower.
1657840	1660680	And so I looking dead, look at the flowers.
1661400	1666640	And so I, I poked at it as pig, and then we all like farmed and
1666640	1668120	maimed and I made new friends.
1669320	1670640	That game is wild sometimes.
1670960	1671400	All right.
1671640	1673720	Uh, let's get into, it's all about making friends.
1673760	1674800	Let's get into your gaming week.
1674800	1677400	And the other, is it been all dead by daylight or have you been
1677400	1678200	playing some other stuff too?
1679440	1682560	Um, I, of course it's been mostly dead by daylight.
1682600	1688200	Um, I actually, uh, did a forego of my stream last night, just because I wanted
1688200	1690400	to prep for Monday and I've been really tired.
1691160	1696640	Um, I, I've been playing, um, Fantasian cause that's what I stream on Tuesdays
1696680	1699600	and I need to grind, I'll put it that way.
1699880	1704000	My ass got handed to me on my last boss battle, but that game is so pretty.
1704040	1705320	I love it.
1705920	1709120	And they've actually, uh, just done an update for Fantasian.
1709120	1713840	So there's some new, uh, end game content and some, and they've added a new game
1713840	1722560	plus so rad cause that game could freaking use it, um, I have, uh, I've got
1722560	1727200	Final Fantasy 14 and I'm, uh, actually I put up a poll and only three people
1727200	1731800	replied to it, so I might do another poll, but I'm thinking my Wednesday nights
1731840	1735760	after work is just going to be doing a just chatting stream while playing
1735760	1739880	Final Fantasy 14, so folks want to chat.
1739880	1742880	I can't play new world, like every body fucking else in the world.
1743760	1746160	So I'll play the MMO I can play.
1747320	1751320	All right, let's go to Loki with your gaming week.
1754320	1754840	You're muted.
1754880	1757880	Loki, the joys of sorry.
1758120	1758680	No, you're fine.
1758760	1759120	No better.
1759760	1762240	Um, so it pretty much the same as last week.
1762280	1766640	It's been mostly Minecraft with a little bit of power wash simulator.
1767480	1772680	So, um, I did end up picking up Metroid dread and the Nickelodeon, um, all star
1772680	1777600	brawl game, uh, which I know my kid has been playing the Nickelodeon all star
1777600	1780720	role, they're not going to touch Metro cause they they're afraid of that game.
1781200	1785680	Um, eventually I will play it cause it looks really good.
1785720	1788360	So, um, but you know, I had to get it.
1790120	1792320	But yeah, I'm power washing sim.
1792320	1796920	I think I, the last thing I did was the firehouse.
1797880	1799680	Oh, I'm not even up to that yet.
1799680	1803120	I'm as far, so I played that on stream.
1803200	1804520	I know I missed it.
1804520	1805680	I was like, oh man.
1805680	1809680	Well, all of my streams are archived all over at my channel, but I know who wants
1809680	1812840	to watch in the archive streams, you know, usually you're looking for a certain
1812840	1814320	thing, but it was a, what we did.
1814320	1817920	I washed one of the houses, but I feel like there's more than one house, so I
1818160	1819920	don't know how to, how to better say it.
1820200	1825120	So, um, but what I unlocked, no, it was two story, two story.
1825120	1825440	Okay.
1825440	1825640	Yeah.
1826360	1830800	What I unlocked was a skate park and we went in there right at the end of the
1830800	1834640	stream and it's like, there's just bullshit everywhere on that stage.
1834640	1836400	I was like, this one's going to take a little while.
1836520	1839000	Cause I did, I did the house start to finish on stream.
1839000	1840080	I only did that.
1840080	1842360	And the golf cart, the golf cart took me like 10 minutes.
1842440	1842720	Yeah.
1842840	1845320	The house like was like an hour and a half.
1845400	1846760	Like it was an hour and a half until I was done.
1847080	1849120	But it went by really, really fast.
1849520	1850240	It was a fun stream.
1851320	1851680	Yeah.
1852040	1852440	Awesome.
1853320	1853600	All right.
1853600	1854560	Anything else for your gaming week?
1855680	1856080	Nope.
1856080	1856440	That was it.
1856440	1857400	Just those two things.
1858040	1861520	Um, for my gaming week, I have been trying to, you know, I say this a lot.
1861560	1864440	I'm trying to stream more, but I think I found a good rhythm that works for me.
1864440	1866680	And that is that period right after I'm off work.
1866960	1871040	So, um, the best time to try to catch me live is going to be around
1871040	1874000	like four 30 ish Pacific to around six.
1874000	1876640	I usually end by then I don't go much longer than an hour and a half.
1876640	1880000	Maybe two hours, just because I don't want to get into the evening stuff.
1880000	1883320	Especially when my husband, Alan does a lot of streaming in the evenings.
1883320	1886080	I'm like kind of all over the place.
1886080	1887960	Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday is depending on when he's around.
1888200	1890320	So, um, yeah, so I found a good space.
1890320	1891760	I actually did a bit of streaming.
1891760	1893800	I did a one night of Final Fantasy.
1893960	1897760	I did a night with the power wash simulator and I did a Metro dread on Friday.
1897760	1902120	So yes, I picked up Metro dread and I went in, I went into Metro dread, really
1902120	1906160	sight unseen, like you guys know, I kind of held back on some of the trailers and
1906200	1907520	some of the description of the game.
1907520	1911000	Like once the initial launch trailer was out, that's all I needed.
1911040	1912960	New Metroid game coming sold.
1913000	1913720	That's all I need.
1913760	1914560	I don't need anything else.
1914920	1916760	Um, so I played the game.
1917360	1920920	I was not expecting that this Metroid is survival horror.
1921440	1925160	And of course I had people in my chat, like Bobby Black Wolf, that are like,
1925200	1927520	the name of the game is literally Metroid dread.
1927520	1928520	What were you expecting?
1928520	1933560	And I was like, I don't know, but I just, this is not super Metroid anymore.
1933560	1936920	When did this become survival horror, where you go into a certain zone and
1936920	1938760	now this big red dot is chasing you.
1938760	1941000	And if they catch you, you are one-shotted.
1941400	1944040	Like that's some pretty serious stuff.
1944160	1949720	So I ended up screaming a lot more like the, you know, like when you go
1949720	1954800	behind the door, like that whole type of thing was like, that should be the
1954800	1960800	name of the game is Metroid because that would more accurately define the
1960800	1962720	experience of playing the game.
1963120	1964200	Um, yeah.
1964200	1967040	Fifth Dream in chat says those fucking EMMI.
1967040	1967480	Yes.
1967480	1968160	Very that.
1968400	1970720	SSG100Matt says, it's a very pretty game though.
1970720	1971200	Yes.
1971440	1975720	Um, some are asking for my thoughts on the game because I do love Metroid so much.
1975760	1979760	I just, my, I'm only like 90 minutes in, so I'm, I'm saving more to
1979760	1981800	stream maybe one more, uh, next week.
1982320	1988680	But I don't, I wasn't expecting the survival horror thing where you go into
1988680	1990240	certain areas and you're chased by the robot.
1990240	1991600	I kind of wasn't expecting that.
1991760	1996400	So it threw my mindset off because usually I approach Metroid games and
1996400	2000280	Castlevania type games where I'm like, I'm going to explore every nook and
2000280	2005200	cranny of this zone and scan every part of the wall and do this and do that.
2005400	2006520	That's how I approach it.
2006520	2008680	But I can't do that in Metroid Dread.
2008800	2013320	Now, once you defeat the EMMI in an area, you can go back and you can be a little
2013320	2015520	more, but it just kind of threw off my rhythm, I guess.
2015760	2017360	So I just was a little surprised.
2017400	2020120	So, uh, I think the jury is still out a little bit.
2020160	2024920	I am going to give one pretty big criticism of the game that I, I just
2024920	2029200	don't like it, and that is the fact that some of the, and it's interesting because
2029200	2032760	I've seen the game dragged on Twitter a little bit for accessibility reasons
2032760	2036320	because of this, I wasn't even really thinking of that, but wow.
2036320	2036840	Yes.
2036880	2040800	Um, and that is that some of the controls are too much.
2041160	2042000	It's too much.
2042240	2046360	And what I mean by that is that like, okay, you kill the boss, you get the
2046400	2053680	cannon, now you have to like hold R and blast with Y and then hit this button to
2053680	2056800	do it's like, you're hitting all these buttons in a weird rhythm that doesn't
2056800	2057480	really make sense.
2057480	2061000	And I, I just, uh, Jamie, I see you talking, but you're muted.
2062240	2062760	What are you saying?
2064080	2066240	I was going to say, how many fingers do they think you have?
2066600	2068800	I, I, it just felt weird.
2068800	2073800	It doesn't feel natural and it feels needlessly complicated for a game where
2073800	2077920	I'm used to, Oh, you just hit select to toggle between missiles, super missile,
2077920	2078400	whatever.
2078680	2081960	Um, and so I, I don't love that.
2082080	2084520	Um, I think it makes those robots.
2084960	2089200	Artificially difficult to kill and I don't think it needs that.
2089640	2091840	So that's, that's my kind of thing with that.
2092280	2097360	Um, fifth dream says hold five buttons, turn the analog stick, hold X and fire.
2097360	2097720	Yes.
2097720	2101600	It's very that, and I'm not loving that controls on top of that.
2101640	2101920	Yeah.
2101920	2102360	Right.
2102640	2103000	Yeah.
2103320	2109280	So I just think that could be simplified and, you know, whereas I am easily able to
2109280	2112240	move my hands and I have motor skills and all that stuff.
2112520	2115200	Uh, not everybody is as fortunate.
2115200	2119360	And so I just think even for that reason, Nintendo ought to look at how can this
2119360	2121120	process maybe be a little easier?
2121320	2123320	DJ Roma S says, how far into the game are you?
2123320	2124600	Only about 90 minutes.
2124640	2128640	I got, so the first Emmy is a gimme, like you hardly do anything, right?
2128640	2129280	That one's a gimme.
2129280	2130040	I got past that.
2130280	2133600	We did that whole second area with the second Emmy and I killed that Emmy.
2133840	2137880	I got up to seeing the third Emmy, the green one, and then that's where we
2137880	2138640	stopped on the stream.
2138640	2140520	And that was about 90 minutes, maybe a little more.
2140920	2145480	So, uh, and that was a couple of boss fights with that as well and all that
2145480	2145960	good stuff.
2146520	2148280	Um, yeah.
2148280	2151880	Tiger class says it's one of those things you see in games where there's something
2151880	2154560	following you that is an instant kill if you try to combat it.
2154560	2156040	And the only way is to get away from it.
2156040	2158280	Yes, that is, that is what that mechanic is.
2158280	2162560	And it's, uh, it was just a little bit jarring anyway, but I'm, I'm enjoying it
2162560	2164040	and graphically it looks really good.
2164040	2166800	And so since I said something negative, let me say something really positive
2166800	2167520	because I do believe this.
2167880	2172680	I love how the game transitions from like the 2D running scenes and like you blast
2172680	2176280	the door and then all of a sudden, bam, cut scene, but it's seamless.
2176360	2178080	Like there's no loading time.
2178080	2181120	It's just like you run through the door and now it's, and now, and then after the
2181120	2185040	cut scene, the camera just spins around and bam, you're back in the 2D mode.
2185040	2185720	Seamless.
2185920	2189400	Like, I think the way graphically, it does a lot of those tricks.
2189560	2190440	Really cool.
2190680	2197280	So it's, um, it's, it's neat that it's a 2D game, but it is not afraid to show off
2197280	2202320	3D in the environment because they do a lot of like, uh, checks to prime.
2202560	2206200	Like you're never playing Metroid prime, but in some of those cut scenes, you're
2206200	2209160	seeing through Samus's helmet, like it's Metroid prime.
2209360	2212120	And I think that's neat how they kind of incorporate that in there.
2212800	2215080	Uh, Tiger class says, so it's more than one Emmy.
2215120	2216560	It's not just one that follows you around.
2216760	2220560	There are seven that is mentioned early on in the story in the first 10 minutes.
2220560	2221600	So it's not really a spoiler.
2221600	2222440	There are seven.
2222880	2226960	Um, but, um, they all are very similar in what they do.
2227400	2228920	Um, so there is that.
2229880	2232360	Uh, Crystal wasn't very impressed with it though.
2233040	2233680	Oh, interesting.
2233680	2235120	Crystal was watching my stream.
2235200	2239560	Did, did, did Crystal end up getting the game in the mail, I guess later that night?
2240280	2241000	Um, hold on.
2241040	2242720	It might be a different crystal we're thinking of.
2242760	2244080	Oh, okay.
2244320	2247320	I'm thinking of the crystal that used to live here that I gave my Xbox or sold my
2247320	2248800	Xbox to that it's in the Bay area now.
2249680	2251680	Um, that's actually how I was thinking of.
2251920	2252320	Oh, okay.
2252360	2252680	Yeah.
2253040	2255640	So I'd have to find the comments on Twitter.
2256000	2256360	Okay.
2256480	2257360	I'd be curious.
2257960	2262240	Um, yeah, I, I know it's, I know it's hitting with some mixed results and even
2262240	2264800	I'm kind of like, I like it.
2264840	2271720	I don't know if I love it because they really changed the formula and I, I don't.
2272280	2273680	It just sits okay with me.
2273920	2275000	That's where I'm at right now.
2275000	2278600	But I want, I want to give the game more than 90 minutes before I say this
2278600	2280400	definitive kind of thing on it.
2280480	2282160	So, all right.
2282800	2285320	Um, let's see other games.
2286240	2287280	Yeah, I do.
2287280	2288560	Oh, I almost thought I found it.
2288560	2289160	Nevermind.
2290040	2292160	Um, I'll, I'll find it later.
2292200	2292760	Oh yeah, here we go.
2292760	2294400	Was really hyped for Metroid Dread.
2294400	2295120	Then I played it.
2295480	2298800	If I wanted a game this cheap, I would just play a Souls game.
2298800	2300040	Not having any fun at all.
2300040	2302120	It's pretty, but it's not doing anything for me.
2302200	2302560	Yep.
2302640	2305440	So, and that's, that's, I can read right into that.
2305440	2309520	It's the Emmy mechanic that people are not necessarily enjoying and it is a
2309520	2313920	different mindset and that's my biggest, that can, that could also be a big win
2313920	2319760	for some people that is really fun for some people, um, that are, especially if
2319760	2322440	you are into those Souls types of games and stuff, that's going to be a big win
2322440	2325520	for you, but, you know, I, I don't know if it is that way for everybody.
2325880	2328600	Um, Tiger Claw on chat says, you know, speed runners will find
2328600	2329960	ways to kill the Emmys faster.
2329960	2330520	Oh, no doubt.
2330520	2332920	Speed runners are already having a field day with Dread.
2332920	2336440	I'm sure Metroid Dread absolutely will be it.
2336480	2339920	Well, I shouldn't, it'll be in a future games done quick.
2339920	2343240	I don't want to say the next one, maybe the one after that, but you absolutely
2343240	2347720	will see Metroid Dread, uh, in a speed run and then not that distant future.
2347720	2349360	And it'll be fascinating to watch.
2349400	2350200	It will.
2350200	2354080	I actually, yes, I'd be very fascinated to see what they do with the Emmys
2354080	2354920	and that whole type of thing.
2354920	2356240	I'm actually looking forward to that.
2356640	2357680	Uh, Bobby points out.
2357680	2360400	It can't be an awesome games done quick cause they close those submissions.
2360440	2360960	Weeks ago.
2360960	2364680	Well, that's why I didn't want to, I chose my words carefully there.
2364680	2366240	Cause I was like, maybe the summer one.
2366640	2367040	All right.
2368400	2369720	Other games I played this week.
2369720	2371280	One I'm going to say really fast.
2371320	2373600	So I mentioned I was going to buy this game, but I was
2373600	2374520	going to buy it a little late.
2374760	2377360	So I finally did pick up Diablo two resurrected.
2377880	2379360	Haven't played a lot of it.
2379720	2384880	Um, but I love the feature where you can toggle between the old graphics and the
2384880	2388640	new graphics by just hitting like the letter G you flip between the two graphics.
2388640	2393240	Because when I go back to the old graphics and how often we do, we do this
2393240	2398280	with retro games, sometimes I go back to the old graphics and I go, damn, it
2398280	2403040	looked that blocky, I don't remember that, but you have to remember we weren't
2403040	2407160	playing Diablo two on high definition televisions, essentially, or monitors.
2407640	2411240	Back in, you know, the day when that game was first out, we were playing
2411240	2416080	on those giant CRT monitors that actually, if you had a 15 inch monitor,
2416080	2417680	you were lucky, you know what I mean?
2418000	2423920	Uh, and yeah, so now, you know, on these big 24 inch, 27 inch HD TVs,
2424240	2426560	um, it looks very blocky.
2427560	2430520	Fifth dream in chat says toggling is the only way I can even
2430520	2432240	tell they updated the graphics.
2432480	2434400	It feels the same if you never switch.
2434560	2438760	Yeah, the game still feels the same for better and for worse.
2439120	2442440	So like I spent hours and hours and hours in Diablo three.
2442880	2447600	And so I'm not used to this whole fucking like, and I knew this was
2447600	2450080	a thing and I remember this was the thing, but I'm not used to like
2450080	2452560	your inventory fills up in 10 seconds.
2452840	2456280	And you better have like a thousand town portals to go back and sell things.
2456600	2460480	They got rid of that in Diablo three.
2460720	2463520	So, and Bobby does remind us games.
2463520	2467480	Weren't as blocky on CRTs just because of the way CRTs work.
2467520	2468480	Yes, very that.
2468640	2471840	So it was, uh, it was very different, but anyway, that's not a read on it's
2471840	2474520	just, it's one of those things I appreciate the graphics look for.
2474560	2478360	I mean, it is Diablo two with better graphics.
2478840	2483400	This is the game most people asked for when they said I want them to
2483400	2485880	remake Diablo two, but don't fucking change it.
2486480	2487360	Don't make a deal.
2487520	2488000	Okay.
2488000	2491400	You got your wish for better and for worse.
2491520	2492040	Okay.
2492240	2493000	That's all I'm saying.
2494080	2495880	Uh, I think that's enough of my human week.
2495880	2499720	I, I, you know, the usual stuff dead by daylight, I had the sweatiest
2499720	2503560	survivors today I was playing against, but it's, it's because I'm getting
2503560	2507360	better with Wraith, so I know I'm moving up into MMR and I play
2507360	2508680	a sweaty fucking Wraith.
2508680	2509120	Okay.
2509240	2510920	No ed devour.
2511080	2512240	It's all on the table.
2512240	2513000	I don't give a fuck.
2513000	2513880	Don't rely on that.
2513880	2514920	No ed Rob.
2514960	2516840	I, I couldn't today.
2516880	2520960	Cause again, sometimes, you know, you just get some maps and the totems
2521000	2523320	like spawn on the survivors ball sacks.
2523360	2525360	Like it just spawns that fast.
2525400	2526920	Like, and so what are you going to do?
2526920	2527800	What we're talking about?
2528080	2528880	It's okay.
2529760	2534720	So in dead by daylight, killers have the ability to have perks that
2534720	2536480	will spawn on what's called totems.
2536880	2538800	Totems are in random places on the map.
2539120	2542400	If the survivor spends five seconds or so cleansing a totem,
2542560	2543920	they get rid of your ability.
2544360	2548200	Some maps, such as the Hawkins laboratory, that's going away in
2548200	2550760	November, have pretty good totem spawn points.
2550800	2552640	They're hard to find the totems on those maps.
2553160	2557960	Some maps like, uh, the pen asylum I was playing this match on, you
2557960	2561960	have the potential to spawn a totem right next to a generator.
2562240	2564960	So as the survivors are doing their thing, they're going to see it.
2565040	2569560	So anyway, you know, please, I realized we'd go off the deep end with dead
2569560	2571880	by daylight chat sometimes cause dark soccer and I play so much.
2571880	2573640	I just didn't know what you meant by sweaty players.
2573640	2575880	I was like, I have no idea what that's referencing.
2576320	2580880	Um, sweaty players means two of them brought flashlights and the other one
2580880	2585040	had a flash bang and they made it their job to make sure I could hook nobody.
2585800	2586320	Oh, got it.
2586320	2588320	To sweat is to put effort into something.
2588560	2588960	Yeah.
2589000	2589400	Got it.
2589440	2592160	And if you're really sweating about it, you're really putting a lot of effort.
2592160	2594240	If I'm asking questions about stuff, I'm old now.
2595360	2596400	I don't like that.
2596400	2598480	I'm older than you and I play this game.
2598520	2602480	They weren't sweating to do the game mechanics of repair five
2602480	2603640	generators and get out the door.
2603640	2607520	They were sweating to make my life miserable as the killer.
2607720	2608640	It was a bully match.
2608640	2609120	So that's why I bring no ed.
2609320	2609640	What?
2610480	2613440	Well, they, they were being efficient.
2613960	2614560	That's the thing.
2614560	2620080	If you get a good Swift that knows what they're doing, they know how to use their
2620080	2625280	teamwork and they're efficient and you have to sweat, but the really sweaty
2625280	2630880	survivors are the ones who are trying to go the extra route to get the
2630880	2635360	flashlights done, the killer, although I sometimes a lot of, it doesn't take
2635360	2636720	much to make me sweat anymore.
2636720	2644440	So just say, well, I, that's kind of why, and I'll, I'll end my part of
2644440	2648200	the DVD stuff after this was kind of why, like, I super love playing pig
2648200	2652080	and Freddy because I always bring whispers.
2652320	2655680	So I have an idea where people are, especially for pig.
2655680	2659600	Like my build right now is, uh, whispers, corrupt intervention.
2659600	2662760	So a half of my generators start off unusable.
2663360	2664680	I'm explaining for, for Loki.
2665280	2670240	Um, the other one I use is, uh, hex ruin.
2671040	2675200	Which means that when someone stops working on a generator, it starts regressing.
2676600	2681880	And then I also though, we'll use pop goes the weasel because when they have
2681880	2688640	killed my, uh, my hex ruin, when they find my totem, I at least can get the
2688640	2693600	generators to start degrading a little bit differently with that one.
2693600	2695840	And it's a perk, not a, not a totem.
2696680	2703040	So all of those together, I mean, I have a good time with pig pretty much.
2703720	2707760	You're, you're the pig that, um, when, uh, Tay goes into a match
2707760	2709840	and goes, ah, just DC it's a pig.
2711160	2711520	Yeah.
2711600	2713520	People will DC against, against my pig.
2713960	2715600	I take that as a badge of honor.
2716480	2721720	I'm actually going to start, uh, running one of those tallies in, in my channel.
2721800	2723560	But Loki DC is disconnect.
2723560	2728080	And that means that somebody, somebody would rather take a five minute penalty
2728080	2730880	and waiting for the next game, then finish the game that they signed up for.
2731400	2734360	That's a decent, and I've done it.
2734480	2735560	I've done it as a killer.
2735560	2736960	I've done it as a survivor.
2737840	2740200	Sometimes you're just like, I'm not, I'm not having it.
2741000	2742920	Sometimes you will get asshole matches though.
2742960	2745560	You will, you will like absolute bullies, but yeah.
2745600	2745960	Okay.
2746080	2747040	All right, let's move on.
2747080	2750360	Well, a lot of this, of course, we've learned from watching various
2750360	2755560	Twitch streams and doing things on Twitch and Twitch, once again, in the
2755560	2757040	news this week, aren't they Loki?
2757640	2762560	Yes, because Twitch got hacked and what did the hackers take?
2762800	2763560	Yes.
2764880	2769640	Um, so they went, they went in and they, they took all of Twitch, all
2769640	2771400	of it, every single bit of it.
2771440	2776200	And, um, so now they've got, for example, the source code of Twitch and
2776200	2779760	all of the special, uh, tools that they have, the mobile desktop and video
2779760	2784560	game clients, they now know that there is a unreleased steam competitor
2784560	2787080	called, um, Oh gosh, I don't remember what it's called.
2787080	2787560	Vapor.
2787680	2790440	It's vapor, very aptly name.
2791280	2796040	Um, basically just all of it.
2796160	2801560	So that's concerning because yeah.
2801600	2807160	Um, that's, they leaked everybody's earnings that, uh, we're
2807160	2808560	making money on the platform.
2809320	2813680	Um, well, I guess, I don't know.
2813680	2815760	It's not necessarily like all of the earnings.
2815760	2818040	It's just the revenue from subscriptions.
2818320	2821040	And it's also only like the top thousand or something like that.
2821040	2824800	Cause if you search for me or you search for VOG network, you're not
2824800	2827520	going to find it because we don't make that much money on, we do.
2827520	2828920	We search for me.
2828960	2830920	You're gonna find, I make no money because I don't stream.
2830960	2834600	In fact, you, you might be sad and give more money when you
2834600	2836000	see that we're not making any.
2836000	2837200	I'm just, I'm teasing Darcy.
2837240	2838040	I'm not in it for the money.
2838120	2843320	Well, there's also, um, uh, I think like everybody had their Twitch keys reset.
2843880	2844480	Yes.
2845040	2847960	And encouraged to change their passwords, which of course I did all of that.
2848000	2848480	Yeah.
2848480	2849600	I need to do that.
2850920	2852440	Which is kind of funny.
2852440	2854960	Here's a funny, uh, behind the scenes story.
2855120	2858600	So they didn't like, so they reset the, the stream keys, right?
2858600	2863240	So, um, Bobby, uh, was like, oh, cause we all use separate, uh, stream
2863240	2865640	keys to do this VOG network thing.
2865640	2868200	I have my own stream key, but cause you can do that.
2868200	2870240	You can issue out basically like partner keys.
2870240	2872960	That's how a lot of corporate brands allow people to stream to
2872960	2874160	their channels, different people.
2874160	2874640	Right.
2874800	2878240	So, you know, um, so VOG does this, so I have my own key.
2878400	2881960	So, um, Bobby went in this week and reset it.
2881960	2885120	He's like, okay, since they're resetting all the stream keys, here's this.
2885360	2885960	Have fun.
2886280	2889440	The day after he does it, we get another email.
2889440	2891520	So they reset everybody's stream keys.
2891840	2892680	Stream keys.
2892680	2896560	And then two days later they realized, oh, we have to reset
2896840	2899760	the, um, delegated stream keys too.
2899880	2901560	So they reset it again.
2901920	2906360	And Bobby had to send me another key and that wasn't a waste of time or anything,
2906440	2909600	but just remember now how to find my stream keys, how to go do that.
2909800	2910040	Yeah.
2910040	2910600	Google it.
2910880	2911160	Yeah.
2911360	2911560	Yeah.
2911560	2912800	How to find your stream key.
2913080	2913640	Yeah.
2913640	2915000	It's in your profile information.
2915040	2916080	Yeah, I know.
2916120	2918400	It's just, you know, it's a mess.
2918440	2920040	How did I sound like such a boomer today?
2920040	2920720	I swear to God.
2921440	2922880	Um, okay.
2924160	2928400	So outside of that, you know, obviously they, they confirm that yes, they'd been
2928400	2932800	hacked and, um, they said that full credit card numbers are not still restored by
2932800	2937000	Twitch, so, uh, those weren't necessarily exposed, but, you know, change of
2937000	2938120	passwords, all that fun stuff.
2938280	2943320	Plus they also got access to the, uh, switch or the Twitch SOC internal red
2943320	2948080	teaming tools, which are, you know, different things that they use for.
2948080	2951280	Um, I was like developer stuff.
2951320	2956520	Um, so yeah, so like, you know, how we have this whole body problem.
2956560	2958080	Well, I think it's going to get worse.
2959080	2960160	So that that's good.
2960520	2965360	Um, and then on top of that, just to scare you a little bit more that,
2965360	2967400	Hey, it may not be over yet.
2967520	2972120	Um, they've been taking Jeff Bezos picture, a really horrible picture
2972120	2976720	of him and kind of pacing the background of different game categories.
2977080	2980960	So if you look at some of the different games, you may have seen Jeff Bezos
2980960	2986960	face kind of, uh, slowly peeking out as if some Halloween specter looking
2987480	2989960	behind the game, like Michael Myers, right?
2990000	2992240	That's freaking frightening that kind of thing.
2992280	2998800	So, uh, that's, that's reassuring that that's still happening now after it's
2998800	3002400	been hacked that, you know, somehow they're able to do that.
3002400	3003760	So do they still have access?
3003760	3004640	What's going on?
3004680	3005920	Like, do we even know?
3006720	3007200	I don't know.
3007200	3011520	So I guess we're at the wait and find out what happens from all of
3011520	3014400	this, because that's not great.
3014760	3015960	It's not a great place to be in.
3016000	3017280	No, it is not great.
3017360	3022240	Um, and there's supposedly like, there's like a part two that's coming
3022240	3023800	at some point or something, right?
3023840	3024280	Yes.
3024280	3024600	Yes.
3024600	3026760	Because there's 125 gigabytes for the dump.
3026800	3028480	They, they call it part one.
3028760	3031840	So it's, there may be more coming.
3031840	3032320	Who knows?
3032320	3036160	The part I'm trying to wrap my head around is that the impression I was
3036160	3040160	getting from some of what they were releasing, I felt like they were trying
3040160	3044640	to come off as like an ethical hacker, which is a hard thing to do when
3044640	3046160	you're posting things to 4chan.
3046240	3047640	Um, sorry, not sorry.
3047640	3047960	Right.
3048800	3053640	Also like, you know, you are divulging people's incomes, which I guess if
3053640	3057720	you're trying to take the Robin hood, you know, F the top percent or whatever,
3057960	3061560	then I guess I can let that slide a little bit, but it's, it's supposed
3061560	3063120	to be an ethical hack or no.
3063800	3066600	Like, I, I don't understand what the point of calling people's incomes
3066600	3070800	at, cause like, yeah, people, they, you know, they work for that kind of stuff.
3070800	3074240	You have like folks like Hassan or whatever that like stream, like seven
3074240	3078120	days a week, I mean, you have lots of people and they stream for like 10
3078120	3082360	hours a day, like, dude, that's more hours in it for their work that they're
3082360	3084000	putting in than I'm putting in for my work.
3084000	3088000	Like, yeah, I think that they deserve the money that they get.
3088040	3092640	It's listen, we're not holding guns to people's heads to force them to
3092680	3095680	subscribe to these people, people subscribe because they want to support them.
3095680	3098440	So like, I don't see where the downside is there.
3099640	3100520	No, but that's seriously.
3100520	3102560	The thing is it is their job.
3102600	3104800	It is what they do for a living.
3104840	3110880	It is not always fun, you know, but it's what they do for a living.
3110880	3116520	It'd be like someone went to my job, published my job and my salary, which
3116600	3119640	I mean, I kind of don't care, but personally, I mean, I care if people
3119640	3121800	know where I work, but you know what I mean, going back to my point.
3122840	3128200	It's not, it's, there's nothing ethical about it.
3128560	3130800	They did it for E-peen.
3131080	3135240	There was a very interesting response by Pokimane, one of the streamers
3135240	3136800	that's on that top, top 100.
3136920	3138440	She does very well for herself, obviously.
3138440	3141360	And she, she was, uh, very, uh, very much in the limelight recently.
3141360	3146280	Cause she, she helped AOC, the Congresswoman do her stream when she was doing
3146280	3150360	Among Us, um, during the last election cycle, um, Pokimane had a very interesting
3150360	3151240	response to the whole thing.
3151280	3155600	She kind of said, well, now, you know why I limit the amount that people can donate.
3156320	3159000	Um, and I thought that was an interesting take on it is she was kind of like, I
3159000	3159600	got the impression of that.
3159600	3161440	She's like, I know I make a lot of money doing this.
3161600	3162560	I don't need to make more.
3162880	3166680	Cause she, she also was, she addressed like a sponsorships and things of that
3166680	3171320	nature that aren't captured by that list, which, um, I just thought it was interesting.
3171680	3175160	Uh, speaking of interesting, this comment in our chat over at twitch.tv slash
3175160	3179920	vlog network, um, some, a couple of people wondering, could this have been an inside
3179920	3185240	job, uh, DJ Rama S says, I think it was an inside job, third party, critical myth
3185240	3187360	says, definitely seems like an inside job to me.
3187400	3187840	What were you saying?
3187840	3188120	Loki?
3188720	3192840	I was going to say Twitch said it was a third party that did it so far.
3192840	3195200	They haven't figured out that it's a internal.
3195440	3199120	See sometimes though, Loki, it's all in the words because technically, and I don't
3199120	3201360	mean to, you know, get my tinfoil party.
3201480	3204600	Technically, if you don't work for Twitch anymore, but you took something on your
3204600	3205960	way out the door, you're a third party.
3205960	3207040	Cause you don't work for him anymore.
3207560	3210400	I like how they called it a Twitch security incident.
3211240	3211600	Dude.
3211600	3212280	Come on.
3213560	3219000	Uh, DJ Rama S says, and now people are salty because so much streamers are making bank.
3219560	3223280	Wait until I tell you how much people in Hollywood are making.
3223800	3227920	Just, just you wait, you know, did you go see that new Bond movie this weekend?
3228040	3230080	Do you know how much Daniel Craig made for that?
3230080	3231880	Just wait until I tell you.
3231880	3235680	I can understand the continuing with the comment Rama says, I can understand because
3235680	3240360	some streamers throw that in your face, so fuck them, but overall, if you're salty,
3240360	3243240	the streamers are making more money than you, then it's a personal issue to you.
3243640	3247120	Uh, and the tiger class says, some will see those earnings and think they should
3247120	3248520	probably get into Twitch.
3249680	3253720	Well, I I'm all for enabling more people to get on Twitch because Twitch is a
3253720	3260200	platform, use the platform and there's, if, if you looked at that list, I think
3260200	3264200	if you looked at that list, you're going to notice there was very much a trend
3264360	3267040	within the top a hundred top 500 streamers.
3267600	3272800	There was a very much a trend in what all those people look like and what
3272800	3274440	gender they are and so forth.
3274520	3275080	Sure.
3275280	3278880	There's exceptions in there, but for the most part, does, do those exceptions
3278880	3281240	match the exceptions in the population?
3282200	3283680	No, no.
3284440	3290760	So, yes, we need more people to get on Twitch, but are they going to want
3290760	3292120	to do that after this happened?
3292160	3292640	Doubt it.
3294880	3295240	Anyway.
3295480	3295800	All right.
3295840	3301240	Uh, anything else you want to say on this before I move to the next, uh, I almost
3301240	3302640	want to read your comment on Arama.
3302680	3304960	I'm not going to, but I'm just going to acknowledge it because you're talking
3304960	3308920	about your day job and I'm just kind of winking at you, you know, you know, um,
3309400	3311760	anything else you want to say, Loki, before we go to the next story?
3312040	3312920	No, I'm good.
3313280	3318800	Then let's go to talking about Konami, uh, an old favorite here, uh, you know, back
3318800	3323680	in the day, not, you know, the Konami that publishes E-Football, but the old Konami
3323680	3324400	of yesteryear.
3324400	3328480	So of course, when we talk about retro Konami, this sort of thing really
3328480	3330200	tugs at our heartstrings.
3330440	3334200	Konami announced a contest, and this was right around the time we were doing our
3334200	3337840	show last week, so it missed the cutoff last week, but they announced a contest
3337840	3343800	where indie developers can create brand new games based on the, uh, portfolio of
3343800	3348560	brands and classic IPs, not everything, but there's a pretty good, a pretty good
3348560	3353480	chunk of, uh, quote unquote, forgotten Konami IPs is on this list, not on the
3353480	3353840	list.
3353840	3356800	Castlevania, not on the list, Suikoden or Silent Hill.
3357040	3357440	Yes.
3357440	3362320	On the list, Jairus, Goemon, uh, Yer Kong Fu, I think is on the list too.
3362440	3363480	There's a lot of stuff on there.
3363800	3369520	So, um, whoever wins this contest could get a nice check and potentially some game
3369520	3369960	sales.
3370200	3374320	This is a contest being held in collaboration with the Shueisha Game
3374320	3375240	Developers Camp.
3375360	3381360	So before January 6, 2022, based upon one of these 80 brands, uh, maybe Darsak will
3381360	3384720	get a new Twinbee out of this cause that's on the list, uh, and so forth.
3385000	3389880	Uh, so once you make one of the games based on these brands, then Konami is going to
3389880	3393560	judge them and the grand prize winner will get 2 million yen.
3393560	3395800	That's about $18,000 in US dollars.
3396080	3402360	Uh, but if Konami wants to actually see one of those games come out, they will help
3402360	3404440	the studio develop and release the game.
3404640	3410360	That could be up to 30 million or the equivalent of $270,000 to develop,
3410360	3411960	supervise and so forth.
3412240	3414120	Um, that's pretty neat.
3414360	3419760	Now, I posted about this on Twitter after last week's show, and I got a response from
3419760	3422080	one of our listeners that I really thought was worth reading.
3422760	3426880	And this was from, uh, 13X Forever who comments a lot in Discord, but I think
3426880	3429240	because of time zones isn't really here live usually.
3429720	3436120	And the, uh, response I got was from 13X Forever was, do they compensate the time
3436120	3438360	spent on this for every contestant?
3438680	3441600	Do contestants retain the rights on the prototypes they submit?
3442000	3443960	I guess the answer is no and no.
3444280	3450160	So basically it's the usual con to exploit over enthusiastic indie devs to give them
3450160	3452400	a bunch of new ideas for pennies.
3454040	3458080	As much as that's a cynical perspective, I think it's a fair one, uh, in this, is
3458080	3460800	that, yeah, not every game is going to get picked.
3461000	3465960	Could you run into this situation where Konami suddenly puts out their own thing
3465960	3471320	and it's like, oh, this looks like a lot like the indie developed thing that they
3471320	3472280	could run into that.
3472760	3478920	Still, still, I feel like there's a way Y Y R could reskin pixel
3478920	3480240	poops into a Konami brand.
3482520	3484560	Call it a pro Evo soccer.
3487240	3488600	That's that pro Evo pooper.
3491480	3493560	You better watch out or there's going to be a cheat code.
3493560	3496320	That's going to make the main character wear a soccer Jersey.
3498560	3500240	We can really have pro Evo pooper.
3500280	3504480	Just turn the people that run across in, in the park into soccer players.
3504480	3504920	There you go.
3505040	3505400	Done.
3506000	3511080	Y Y R has, Y Y R has a wife, a child, a job.
3511440	3514680	I don't think Y Y R is going to enter this contest, but I think of people like Y Y R
3514680	3519200	and so forth that maybe do want to make a big thing and you know, it could, there
3519200	3524000	could be a nice thing that develops from this is that, you know, you could maybe,
3524280	3529360	you know, get your foot in the door with the industry, uh, having this beat could
3529360	3529920	be a big thing.
3530920	3533760	That's the same thing as working for exposure, Rob.
3534120	3535480	And you know what I say about that.
3536000	3539200	Farron, people die of exposure.
3539240	3542280	Isn't that what a lot of, isn't that what a lot of indie
3542280	3543520	developers are doing anyway?
3547760	3549520	Not, I mean, what are we doing?
3550560	3553320	Well, we're doing it for, I reiterate, we're not on the list.
3553360	3553600	You're right.
3553600	3554520	We're doing it for, right.
3554560	3555440	We're doing it for fun.
3556080	3556720	There you go.
3556800	3557320	That's it.
3557480	3559280	Don't do this unless it's going to be fun.
3559440	3562560	Because the cynical side of that and all that, you know, very, you know,
3562560	3564840	and I say cynical, but I don't, I don't mean it in a negative way.
3564840	3566920	It's a very realistic perspective and so forth.
3567200	3569320	So yes, keep that in the back of your mind.
3569320	3572200	But if you're sitting there going, it might be kind of fun to make a gyrus
3572200	3573680	game, just, just to see what happens.
3574040	3576360	Like Loki, you're a game maker now.
3576400	3577520	You want to enter the contest?
3578080	3578520	No.
3578840	3579200	Okay.
3579200	3580120	Well then it's not fun.
3581800	3585720	I don't, I don't want to make any new games for there.
3585760	3587840	Well, I mean, a new Contra game would be awesome.
3588360	3591360	See, now we're going, I don't know if that was on the list though, but it
3591360	3595120	wasn't probably, you know, cause they're, they're too busy ruining their own
3595120	3599720	franchises, you know, they need other people to make, you know, all right.
3599720	3604120	I'm looking at that enough that we exist in a world that there's a Frogger TV
3604120	3606840	show that is blasphemy as it is.
3606880	3611600	I don't care how removed far removed it is from the actual Frogger game.
3611880	3613040	It's blasphemy.
3613080	3613600	Okay.
3614240	3616640	Blasphemy bless for you.
3616640	3617720	I laughed so hard.
3617720	3619200	My earpiece just fell out.
3620280	3621040	That's not good.
3621520	3621920	All right.
3623280	3623680	Anyway.
3623680	3624000	All right.
3624040	3628200	Uh, I'm also looking at chat and people are just going E-poop ball,
3628240	3630800	uh, pixelvania, soccer shits.
3630840	3632760	They're just, they're just going crazy.
3633040	3634520	Uh, soccer shits.
3634600	3637120	Fifth dream in chat says Russian attack.
3637120	3637320	Oops.
3637320	3638760	I thought I was in a Google window.
3639960	3642480	They remade Russian attack not that long ago.
3642600	3643600	It wasn't very good.
3643600	3645200	Xbox 360 arcade thing.
3645680	3647480	Where it was just the old arcade game with new graphics.
3647560	3648120	Yeah, it was all right.
3648600	3653360	It wasn't, I think they changed up some stuff, but yeah, it wasn't all Kate.
3653640	3654880	And orange, right?
3654880	3656520	Says poop and attack.
3656800	3657360	Oh my God.
3657400	3658040	That's it.
3658240	3658600	That's it.
3658600	3659040	Oh my God.
3659040	3659520	That's it.
3659680	3660200	Loki.
3660200	3663520	Just brand your game, poop and attack and see what happens.
3664880	3665800	Oh, Frogger.
3667520	3668040	All right.
3668160	3672560	Moving on for those pooper, for those newer to orange launch radio, who don't
3672600	3675000	maybe understand the joke, uh, there was a
3675040	3676800	we're five years old and like poop jokes.
3676920	3681160	Basically, namely dark Sakura, uh, said.
3681720	3682920	Got years ago.
3682960	3684920	Like we have this list of dream games.
3685040	3688120	Suddenly we'll be on a tangent train and we'll say, Hey, this game should exist.
3688320	3690960	And dark Sakura came up with this idea for pixel shits.
3690960	3693320	And it was just about, I don't know, I guess it was about shitting on things.
3693520	3696800	Anyway, one of our listeners even come up with that because I'm stupid.
3696840	3698320	I don't even know.
3698320	3699400	We'll have to go back to the archive.
3699400	3700480	I don't even remember what episode it was on.
3700880	3701560	Anyway, why?
3701560	3705200	Why are one of our listeners and a great indie game maker?
3705200	3705440	Why?
3705440	3706720	Why are games.com?
3706720	3707960	I hope I got his website right.
3707960	3711280	I who's made a lot of great games, made that game into a reality.
3711480	3717040	Then in in a moment of, wow, how how recursive can things get here?
3717240	3721880	Loki goes and makes a sequel pixel poops number two.
3723440	3726720	So if if you're wondering why are we sitting here talking about pixel
3726760	3731400	shits all night, because it is a indie indie game, we sort of started that like
3731600	3733840	is an actual thing you can get on itch.io and steam.
3734040	3736200	So check it out if you haven't already.
3736400	3738640	All right, let's move on.
3738840	3741000	I don't even know what I'm on anymore, Rob.
3741200	3744120	Let's talk about other things that took a big shit this week.
3744320	3747200	Dark Sakura, I laughed my ass off.
3747400	3750200	This was funny. I did because I didn't get affected at all.
3750400	3751520	This was great news.
3751720	3753760	I had a great morning this morning.
3753960	3754920	Oh, gosh.
3755080	3758480	So Facebook,
3758680	3763720	the thing I have successfully extracted myself mostly from.
3763920	3765400	Um.
3765600	3772040	Went down, it went down, it went down hard, not just that, Instagram, WhatsApp
3772240	3781000	and the the 11th circle of hell called Facebook, um, we're gone.
3781200	3782640	Like.
3782880	3786680	Someone sent me an Instagram link and I tried to look at it and I'm like, whoa.
3786880	3789680	And it was it was learned it was very this.
3789880	3792160	The last Facebook is in captivity.
3792360	3795320	The galaxy is at peace, that peace.
3795520	3798680	Yes, for five hours on a Monday morning.
3798880	3802680	And everybody in the 60 and up demographic
3802880	3808160	nowhere to go, couldn't play Farmville or whatever they're doing now.
3808360	3811680	Um, anyway, um.
3811880	3813400	So.
3814680	3818040	Deleting, it was if I think it did affect
3818240	3822520	people who were using Oculus, weren't it, didn't it?
3822720	3826400	Oh, yes, because your Oculus stuff is tied to Facebook.
3826600	3827920	Yeah.
3828960	3829680	Yeah.
3829880	3836600	And then it was they basically posted that, yeah, some people, quote,
3836800	3840040	this is a bullshit post, were having trouble accessing their apps
3840080	3844200	and games, but they were working to get it back to normal,
3844400	3849720	which unfortunately they did and a huge amount of the VR contingent cried out.
3849920	3854000	This is why we didn't want this bullshit in Oculus.
3854200	3859200	I like, um, the quote from FIFA Mobile.
3859400	3863960	We're aware that a counseling to Facebook may be encountering issues with logging in.
3864160	3867600	This is due to an outage at Facebook and we hope they resolve it shortly.
3867600	3868800	Thanks for your patience.
3868800	3872520	I saw Niantic put a thing out for Pokemon Go, too, because a lot of people
3872720	3878240	that with Facebook, this this is why you don't have Facebook log into your shit for you.
3878440	3879440	And here's the thing.
3879640	3885400	I, of course, saw the oh, so socially aware Twitter contingent
3885600	3889640	that was saying we shouldn't be celebrating this because there's people
3889840	3893760	in other countries that use WhatsApp for their primary communication.
3893760	3896000	And WhatsApp is basically like the phone to them.
3896000	3898080	And you all are taking delight in these
3898080	3901120	communications being down in these countries where it's needed.
3901320	3904360	And I'm thinking, hold up.
3904560	3909720	There's a difference between taking delight and being well aware that maybe,
3909920	3915040	maybe this should give us all pause to something that a lot of us have been
3915040	3919880	saying for some time now, and that is how many fucking cookie jars Facebook has
3920080	3925080	their hands in. It is 100 percent OK and no, you will not shut me up to say,
3925240	3929000	well, maybe Facebook shouldn't own WhatsApp if it's
3929000	3931120	that fucking important in all these countries.
3931320	3934360	Maybe Facebook and WhatsApp should be separated.
3934560	3939120	And that's the conversation you and I both should be having and not you coming
3939320	3943200	for me going, but what about the people in the what?
3943400	3947040	Stop, stop.
3947240	3948880	Like nothing pissed me off more than that.
3948880	3951440	I'm sorry, but it's like, who are you trying to impress?
3951640	3953160	Who are you trying to impress?
3953320	3954880	Do you want to suck Zuckerberg's cock
3954880	3956840	while you're at it, because that's basically what you're doing.
3957040	3958600	Stop it.
3960200	3962320	I have feelings, sorry.
3962520	3964360	Tiger Claw on chat says, my parents use
3964360	3966840	WhatsApp because we have relatives in Cuba who use it.
3966960	3970760	I'm sorry, that line of communication went down for five days or five, five days,
3970960	3974400	five hours, and I hope that maybe this gives us all
3974600	3979560	question to should these, should Facebook have control over a company like this?
3979680	3981720	Or should we be looking at alternatives
3981920	3987400	like Signal, like Telegram, like there's a lot of choices out there.
3987600	3989720	Pick any of them.
3991680	3996480	Sia Tabiri in chat says they broke up AT&T from AT&T Mobile in the 90s.
3996680	3998920	Oh, yeah, that came right back.
3999120	4000360	They need to do it again.
4000560	4002840	Yeah, that's true.
4003040	4007520	Anyway, like all of the telecoms, Comcast,
4007720	4010640	you know, NBC, you know,
4010840	4013760	all of them, just all of them.
4013960	4015360	Dark Sakura,
4015560	4018760	I know old man was yelling at Cloud for a little bit, but I don't think you disagree
4018760	4022040	either. You have some similar feelings, I think, when it comes to the Facebooks.
4022040	4022800	Yes.
4023000	4025280	Yeah, I mean.
4025480	4028400	I find the place to be a cesspool
4028600	4035440	and not just with how it tracks and steals information,
4035600	4040560	but also with, I'm trying to think of how I want to phrase this,
4040760	4042760	with a certain culture that's fostered there.
4042960	4047400	And I'm not just talking about the right wing red people, you know,
4047600	4052320	but I'm also talking about the echo chamber of the
4052520	4055200	the left massive echo chamber.
4055400	4058760	Sure. And it encourages that sort of circular
4058960	4062760	type of discussion with so much confirmation bias.
4063000	4068360	And because that's what they're promoting, those are the posts that you see first
4068560	4072640	or the we want you to get mad about this thing that other people are doing so we
4072840	4077560	can make profit off of your anger and there is so much sell me underwear.
4077760	4080200	So, you know, that's the thing.
4080400	4084760	It was a very stressful place for me and my life has been a lot better without it.
4084960	4086680	Loki, if you want it to stop showing you
4086680	4089600	underwear ads or whatever, there is a place you can go in and erase
4089600	4090960	like everything it's tracking on.
4091200	4094800	I know I just use an ad blocker anyway, so whatever.
4095000	4099040	Well, I'm on my mobile phone, so that's why it's just you can get ad block
4099240	4102920	for a mobile phone, I know, but I'm getting a new mobile phone here pretty soon.
4102920	4104400	So I haven't really bothered with it.
4104600	4108760	Here's the thing, too, with with Facebook and all that stuff is that there's also
4108960	4112200	so much international influence going on on there like Facebook.
4112200	4116040	You know, I don't want to sound drastic, but I said this in a chat the other day.
4116040	4117920	I said there is a world war being fought
4117960	4121640	right now and it's being fought on Facebook and the weapon is misinformation.
4121840	4124360	And guess what? America is losing.
4124560	4126520	It's almost like they had a whistleblower
4126520	4129400	come out and say the same exact thing the same day it went down.
4129600	4133040	It's so weird and I don't mean to be old boomer yells at cloud,
4133040	4134400	which is apparently the theme tonight,
4134400	4136600	but I don't care because I do also think that's kind of important.
4136600	4139720	And yes, this does have to do with gaming because we have Facebook gaming.
4139720	4142120	We have all of this comes into gaming culture and all that stuff.
4142320	4145800	And I'm so happy that the government is finally doing something and looking
4145800	4148440	into it because, yes, there are a lot of problems with Facebook.
4148640	4150520	Let's tie it to something else that was in the news.
4150520	4152280	Twitch with this hack and all this stuff
4152480	4155120	and the hate raids, something they did recently.
4155120	4158760	I even have two factor authentication on my account and I still had to do this.
4158920	4161840	I wanted to chat in somebody's channel and it said, hold on,
4161840	4164120	we need to text you to verify this account first.
4164320	4166680	And OK, so I did that whole thing.
4166880	4170640	Why doesn't Facebook do this?
4170840	4175120	Make you text, verify your accounts the same way that Twitch does it,
4175120	4179680	you have to use an SMS number and you can't use a Google thing.
4179680	4181280	You can't use a burner account to do it.
4181480	4183920	It has to be a legitimate SMS number.
4183920	4184880	Why can't they do that?
4184880	4186480	Why can't they take that simple step
4186680	4190160	to ensure that the people on there are who they say they are?
4190160	4192880	And if somebody doesn't have the phone, well, then you know what?
4193080	4194720	They don't they don't have the Facebook
4194920	4198120	mobile app anyway, so they're no views to Facebook.
4198320	4200880	Facebook could take that precaution tomorrow,
4201080	4204040	but they're not going to until it was their bottom line.
4204040	4205520	It's just like what they go, you know,
4205720	4209960	go what the whistleblower saying is that they could stop hate speech
4210160	4213000	or at least could curb some of the misinformation on there.
4213080	4215640	But then it would drop engagement, which hurts their bottom line.
4215840	4220800	They make decisions that really only benefit their bottom line, which is money.
4221000	4224920	They don't really care, just like how it's super frustrating that I go on there
4225120	4228560	and I can't just view stuff chronologically, please.
4228760	4231200	Even like Twitter does the same thing now
4231200	4233800	where it's like kind of annoying, they mix stuff up in there.
4233800	4237000	But for the most part, at least it's somewhat chronological.
4237200	4239760	And you can switch if I could find something.
4239960	4242840	You can carry this very easily on Twitter.
4243040	4245480	That's why I don't get Twitter as much shit.
4245680	4250880	But like, you know, with with Facebook, at least like I do like I do use Facebook
4251080	4254280	for some of the groups I'm in for like Minecraft and stuff like that.
4254480	4257840	So I'll like browser those, which those are fine.
4258040	4259000	But.
4259200	4263280	It's just it's I always have to constantly set it to go in chronological order.
4263280	4265600	It's like, no, we want you to see it this way.
4265800	4266800	And it's irritating.
4267000	4269320	Like, I just can't like I'll find something.
4269520	4273640	I'll jump out of the app for a second to go look something up in like my web
4273840	4276320	browser, come back, and then it's already gone.
4276520	4278080	Like I can't find it again.
4278280	4279920	I have a Facebook, too, and I hate it.
4280000	4282440	If I didn't have it, I would miss out on big news.
4282640	4284320	I would miss out on people getting married
4284320	4286760	and having babies because that's just the way it is now.
4286960	4289960	And it sucks. Rob, what
4290120	4294640	if my friends care enough about me to involve me in that part of their life,
4294840	4298720	they'll fucking tell me sometimes the news may not be good.
4298840	4300520	And I'm just going to have to leave it at that.
4300720	4304000	And that was I have other friends that have been telling me about it.
4304200	4310840	But I I'm really to the point where if somebody doesn't tell me.
4311040	4313920	If somebody doesn't think enough to bring
4313920	4317280	it to my attention, to think this is something I'm interested in,
4317440	4321920	like I found out about Barbara through Tiara,
4322120	4323640	but.
4323840	4329360	I am still not going to give Facebook my attention.
4329560	4332080	I'm not going to give it my cookies.
4332280	4337160	I posted once in the last, what, three months
4337360	4340840	for that damn marathon I'm doing tomorrow and that's it.
4341040	4342520	I do not care.
4342720	4347040	And if people do not care enough about me to tell me.
4347520	4349960	About what's going on with them.
4350160	4352800	Then that's on them, that's not on me.
4355200	4357800	Everything I don't care about how easy it is either.
4358000	4360000	This is addressing what Rama said.
4360200	4362360	I don't care about it being fucking easy.
4362560	4367320	If someone cares enough to involve me in their life,
4367520	4371640	they are going to fucking tell me there was a world without Facebook.
4371840	4374680	That we're we're old enough to have experienced, yes.
4374920	4377680	And then the other thing I want to say with Twitter, everything I was screaming
4377680	4380240	about with Facebook and the phone number verification.
4380240	4382200	I honestly want Twitter to do it, too.
4382400	4383840	I want any social media site to do it.
4383840	4384680	I think it's a good idea.
4384680	4387040	There should always be some sort of two factor authentication.
4387240	4388120	There should be that.
4388320	4391960	And just verifying that the number is in the US full stop because
4392160	4396280	Twitter has a huge foreign manipulation bot program problem.
4396480	4401520	Huge. It's very easy to filter it out because you don't have my.
4402520	4407880	You don't have my stupid cousins buying into that bullshit on on Twitter
4408080	4411520	that you do on Facebook, but it's definitely there and there are people
4411720	4413240	falling for it.
4414080	4415280	Anyway,
4415480	4420200	now that we're done yelling at clouds, let's move on to our next story.
4420400	4423280	One last thing, one less teeny thing.
4423480	4425120	Yes, Star Stalker, of course.
4425320	4428040	People have forgotten how to talk to each other.
4428760	4431440	That's it. People have forgotten how to talk to each other.
4431640	4435240	People will sit there and go, why is the world so polarized?
4435440	4437600	When did the US become so polarized?
4437800	4439240	It's Facebook.
4439440	4441640	I just the two there's the two world answer.
4441840	4444280	There's the two word answer to all of the problems.
4444480	4446080	It's Facebook.
4446600	4447400	That's it.
4447600	4451520	Any problem that this country is having with polarization, it's Facebook.
4451720	4457200	Any problem with the vaccine and the elections and it's Facebook.
4457400	4458760	Yep.
4459760	4462360	The reason why that Emmy killed me in
4462360	4465000	Metroid Dread when I wasn't expecting it, somehow it was Facebook.
4465200	4466880	I know it. Moving on.
4467080	4471720	I think it was different when we had things like MySpace and LiveJournal
4471920	4475960	because MySpace was really just like sort of like a short little, you know.
4476160	4477800	It was easy.
4478000	4480080	It was more Twittery, if that makes sense.
4480280	4487000	And LiveJournal for us was basically a public diary.
4487000	4491720	But, yeah, looking at some comments in chat here,
4491920	4495760	I am trying to move on past this topic, but I know you're fine.
4495960	4498200	Sacred Jade said conversation is a lost art.
4498400	4500960	I thought this was because a lot of people agree with this.
4500960	4504960	Fifth Dream says I never wanted to talk to people in the first place
4505160	4510800	and kind of goes on and talks about some other problems that existed before Facebook.
4511000	4512800	Sure, those problems all existed,
4512800	4515600	but Facebook amplified it and Facebook
4515800	4519200	allowed additional noise to make that conversation even worse.
4519400	4521960	But it's like human microphone, right?
4522160	4523040	Yeah. Yeah.
4523240	4525320	All right. In an echo chamber.
4525520	4526760	In everyone's bathroom.
4526960	4528200	OK, moving on.
4528400	4530040	Next story, Loki.
4530240	4533120	So speaking of stuff from the past,
4533320	4535480	we finally are catching up from the past
4535680	4539520	with Epic Games Store as they're adding achievements.
4539680	4542840	Oh, my God, it's about damn time.
4543040	4545600	They're like only several years behind everybody.
4545800	4548640	Not behind as Nintendo, but, you know, I digress.
4548840	4551120	So they're going to be adding a new achievement system.
4551320	4556200	It kind of is like a combination of the achievement points that you get on the
4556400	4562960	Xbox side of things and the like different trophies that you would get on the PlayStation side.
4563160	4567520	So they're going to basically have each game is going to have a thousand XP.
4567720	4572240	And with that, they're going to be different achievements that are ranked.
4572440	4575360	You have bronze, which is five to forty five points,
4575560	4581560	fifty to ninety five for silver, 100 to 200 for gold and 250 for platinum.
4581760	4586280	And it's like, how can we steal from PlayStation and Microsoft system and kind
4586480	4590920	of combine it into that hybrid Voltron of achievement systems?
4591120	4596600	Yeah, so it's going to be very similar to what we see on other platforms, basically.
4596800	4598360	So it's about time.
4598560	4602960	It also kind of actually makes sense because a lot of those games on the Epic
4603160	4606960	Store and any PC game really also exist on consoles.
4607160	4609160	And so a lot of developers don't want
4609360	4612640	to have to make separate trophy slash achievement systems for that.
4612840	4616720	It's very nice when it just kind of all lines up, you know.
4616920	4618840	And maybe what's a bronze trophy here is
4619040	4623440	20 points here is both on the Epic Store, I guess, or whatever the case is.
4623640	4624800	So.
4625000	4626560	There's that.
4627480	4630280	Do they need achievements?
4630480	4634240	Like a lot of people are saying it's three years too late or whatever,
4634440	4636960	Nintendo's gotten away with not doing achievements for a long time.
4637160	4640200	I think we'd all like them to have it, but.
4640400	4642600	Yeah, it's I think that they do.
4642600	4644440	I mean, it would be nice to have that just
4644640	4647600	to have be more robust and more feature complete.
4647800	4649600	I mean, they're still.
4649800	4652800	Stopping carts and other things that they really need on the storefront.
4652800	4657280	I mean, honestly, like we really shouldn't have early access shopping places.
4657480	4661400	It should just be complete already, but.
4661600	4663840	It's Epic Game Store, so whatever.
4664040	4668200	At least I get free PC building simulator this week.
4668400	4669640	Oh, yeah, I picked that up, too.
4669640	4671120	Bobby Black Wolf pointed that out to me.
4671120	4673960	I was like, you should get this. I'm like, OK, because I'm all about right now.
4674160	4675720	Yeah, I do want to play that.
4675920	4678040	All right. But yeah, that's it.
4678240	4679120	All right.
4679320	4681680	Moving on to our next story.
4681840	4685400	We had a famous video game composer who passed away this week,
4685600	4690200	the composer of Dragon Quest, Kochi Sugiyama, passed away at the age of 90.
4690400	4694080	You may know him from the iconic theme to Dragon Quest.
4694280	4697280	He passed away at the age of 90.
4697480	4700880	Let's go on to our next story, Dark Sakura.
4701080	4703440	May his memory be a blessing.
4703640	4705200	So
4705600	4711360	well, more in the Activision Blizzard bullshit drama.
4711560	4714000	And I mean, the bullshit is that they're full of bullshit,
4714200	4720360	but now the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing,
4720560	4727600	DFEH, has filed a motion to intervene in the settlement between the U.S.
4727800	4731040	Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and Activision Blizzard,
4731200	4735840	arguing that their own trial against
4736040	4742040	against the company will be irreparably damaged by the conditions of the settlement.
4742240	4746400	The settlement also includes a clause that will
4746600	4750600	request that will allow Activision Blizzard to remove
4750800	4756000	any allegations of sexual harassment from personnel files in the settlement.
4756200	4762640	So basically, it's destroying evidence that's going to go for DFEH's trial.
4763840	4767080	They actually met with both
4767280	4774040	Activision Blizzard and EEOC on October 5th to let them know of its plan to intervene.
4774240	4777640	Normally, they'd have to wait seven days before filing for the intervention.
4777840	4782880	But because of the grave harm, they filed the motion ex parte,
4782920	4784520	which basically allows it to be filed
4784720	4788400	instantly if the court finds it to be a reasonable request.
4788600	4789960	So
4790160	4792160	and of course,
4792360	4795800	you can see why something like that would be absolutely important,
4796000	4801120	because if they have the permission to destroy this evidence,
4801320	4804480	then they're just going to keep doing it.
4804680	4808680	That's the whole fucking terrible thing about settling like that.
4808760	4812080	And they have a history of
4812280	4814520	of destroying evidence.
4814720	4818640	Two months ago, DFEH accused the company
4818840	4822360	of shredding evidence that would reflect on
4822560	4829080	the company poorly in in the same case with their also
4829280	4832640	you know, the fact that they've hired a union busting firm and they're trying to
4832840	4835760	do a lot of sweeping under the table.
4836760	4838760	They're
4839760	4842160	they're not it's not a pretty look for them.
4842160	4843720	We know they've tried to do it before.
4843920	4844880	We know what they're doing.
4845080	4847200	It's obvious what they're doing.
4847400	4852320	And I'm really glad the DFEH is saying, hey, we're not having this shit.
4852520	4854400	No bad company.
4854600	4856160	No cookie.
4856680	4858680	I don't have anything else to add.
4858680	4861600	I'm looking forward to the deposition of Bobby Kotek.
4861800	4863480	Yeah.
4864360	4870120	Kotaku, by the way, it's where I don't like to say certain things by name,
4870320	4875000	but they actually did get a statement from Activision Blizzard.
4875200	4878000	Sure, I'll read it verbatim.
4878200	4880920	We are committed to making Activision Blizzard the most welcoming,
4880920	4882720	inclusive and safe workplace possible.
4882920	4885160	Our agreement with the EEOC reflects our
4885360	4889400	commitment to significant improvements and transparency, as well as making
4889440	4893640	immediate compensation available to eligible employees who choose to participate.
4893840	4896960	Activision Blizzard is ensuring a workplace free from
4896960	4899560	discrimination, harassment and unequal treatment of any time.
4899560	4901040	Bullshit.
4901240	4902960	Bullshit.
4903160	4907040	I mean, like in the settlement, it states
4907240	4909840	and I'll go ahead and just also verbatim this,
4909840	4913120	because I think it's important to listen to the language of it.
4913320	4914880	Within 30 days from the date,
4914880	4920280	the EEOC notifies Activision Blizzard the names on the distribution lists.
4920480	4925400	They agreed to A, remove the personnel files of each eligible claimant,
4925600	4929040	any references to the allegations related to sexual harassment,
4929240	4934480	pregnancy discrimination and or related retaliation, except to the extent
4934680	4938800	that defendants must keep records of the allegations for any eligible claimants
4939000	4943880	involvement in this charge in order to effect this, effectuate this decree,
4944080	4946640	which in case such records must be maintained
4946840	4951720	separately from the eligible claimants personnel files.
4952560	4954400	Does that make sense to people?
4954600	4956480	Because it says.
4956680	4962720	They can delete it and the other stuff has to be kept separate from the personnel file.
4962920	4964400	And
4964600	4968200	I'll just say, I think Tigerclaw puts it very succinctly in our chat over
4968200	4971440	at twitch.tv slash VOG Network saying destroying the evidence just makes it
4971480	4973600	sound like they're guilty of something.
4973800	4975320	Well, there's even more to this.
4975520	4978880	This has to do with evidence of us not doing this thing.
4978880	4982720	We just can get rid of some of it and we'll still find, as I was saying,
4982920	4986880	there's even more that's really nefarious about this settlement as well.
4986880	4990520	And that has to do with the distribution of the settlement funds.
4990720	4993120	So, again, I'll read this verbatim.
4993320	4995080	If any of the settlement fund remains
4995280	4999040	undistributed after exhausting the efforts to locate the eligible claimants
4999080	5005400	set forth, the excess funds will be distributed between Cyprus Fund for
5005400	5009440	distribution to charitable organizations whose missions involved advancing women
5009640	5013640	in the video game and technology industries or promoting awareness around
5013840	5018480	sexual harassment, gender equality issues, and the diversity and inclusion fund to
5018680	5022760	be used by the defendants exclusively for diversity, inclusion and
5022960	5027120	equity efforts beyond the scope in terms of this the decree.
5027320	5031560	The allocation between Cyprus Fund and diversity and inclusion fund will be
5031760	5036160	decided by the defendants, but subject to approval by EEOC.
5036360	5038320	So basically,
5038520	5045080	Activision Blizzard could use this money for other things that they would, quote,
5045280	5047600	say it goes into.
5047800	5052920	Improving diversity, but might not necessarily do it.
5053920	5055320	And they're willing.
5055520	5057960	There's a lot of failure into that.
5058160	5060840	Yeah, exactly.
5061040	5063000	And they are, again,
5063200	5068880	limiting any sort of information to be disclosed about their liability in any of
5069080	5074320	this and it seems innocent to me.
5074520	5078200	It's absolutely nefarious.
5078400	5081480	And this intervention, I mean, they've done this before.
5081520	5083720	They did it with Riot Games.
5085560	5088040	And this probably happened last time.
5089240	5091680	Yeah, this is.
5091880	5093400	We need to keep our eyes on this.
5093400	5096560	We need to pay attention to the precedent, something like this sets.
5096760	5102080	And honestly enough, it's why the whole settlement business.
5102280	5104640	Is disgusting.
5104840	5107160	It absolutely is disgusting.
5107360	5110040	All right, I got nothing to add, except this
5110080	5113640	news story is just going to continue to be in the news every week.
5113840	5118280	So settlements mean people with money can walk away.
5118480	5121640	With no damage, pretty much.
5121840	5124960	All right, let's move on, Loki.
5125160	5129680	Yeah, so we're talking about how Sony is
5129880	5134680	planning on discontinuing these stores for the Vita and PlayStation three.
5134880	5138840	Well, right now they're planning on removing credit card and PayPal support
5138840	5143800	from both stores in late October, so essentially kneecapping them.
5144000	5148160	I guess you can still have those stores open to redownload software that you've
5148360	5152400	already purchased, but you're going to be unable to make any more purchases
5152600	5155640	starting October twenty seven.
5155840	5157240	So.
5158360	5162720	This is this is them trying to phase those things out again, but now they're just
5162920	5167360	no, I saw the purchase thing, but I saw a legit thing about like how
5167400	5170240	the credit card fees and stuff, they probably just don't want to be paying for
5170240	5174440	those anymore, there's probably there as much as the Internet was pissed off when
5174440	5178320	Sony threatened to pull these things the first time, I'm pretty sure the reality is
5178520	5183080	these stores are not being used very much by the credit card fees.
5183080	5184880	You'd only get paid by transaction.
5184880	5186320	I can't imagine that it would be more
5186520	5190000	expensive on this storefront versus like their current storefront.
5190200	5192800	I think it's more of just like.
5193000	5194760	They want to drive people towards newer
5194800	5199520	software, and so they're probably just going to shut this down so people spend
5199720	5204440	their hard earned money on those seventy dollar Sony games instead of, you know.
5204640	5207600	The original, especially when we were talking about like remasters and remakes,
5207800	5212280	you know, hey, buy the original for 20 bucks instead of 70 or something like that.
5212480	5216280	And several folks in chat are saying you can still add money.
5216280	5217680	You just can't do it directly.
5217880	5224440	Yes, yes. But do I sort of also can tell this is the first step in where
5224480	5227960	Sony has already shown they would like to be.
5228160	5229880	But on one hand, I do get it.
5229880	5233360	You know, I think for the direct, you know, whatever they built into the system
5233360	5235960	and so forth, they probably just don't want to be paying for it anymore.
5236160	5238040	But it isn't worth it to them.
5238240	5241160	And there's a part of me that does get that.
5241360	5245120	And like you guys are saying, you can still get money on there.
5245320	5249840	It's not going to be as easy, but you can do it.
5250040	5252520	So it's not like they're gone.
5252680	5256080	So, yeah, yeah. All right.
5256280	5258280	Moving on to our next story.
5258480	5260560	Kotaku ran a report this week talking
5260760	5264480	about how Metroid Dread is already running on switch emulators.
5264680	5267960	And in the report, Kotaku has talked about how the game is
5268160	5272600	fully playable in various 4K Nintendo switch emulators.
5272800	5275680	They reference a couple of emulators in the story.
5275680	5278400	They talk about Yuzu, which is an open source emulator.
5278600	5280640	They talk about Ryujinx, which is another
5280640	5282920	one that both of these can play the game.
5283120	5288840	You can see some YouTubes of this in action because it plays the game at 4K.
5289040	5290720	Kotaku is getting a lot of shit for running
5290920	5294440	this article from folks on the Twitters and on social media.
5294640	5297600	And I think a lot of people are very upset because
5297800	5301040	Kotaku is talking about piracy
5301240	5305080	only a couple of days after the game came out, I guess.
5305280	5306520	Here's the thing, though, I don't get it.
5306720	5309840	I think that outrage is kind of misplaced.
5310040	5313080	Like, I can I'll meet you halfway.
5313280	5315840	I'll meet you to the point part way, maybe not even halfway.
5315840	5316720	I'll meet you part way.
5316920	5319760	I understand maybe Kotaku didn't firmly
5319960	5325880	enough say, hey, downloading software illegally is wrong.
5326080	5329760	But they also didn't link to the ROMs, they linked to the emulators.
5329960	5333840	And now all of you that are mad about it and posting about it.
5334040	5335760	It's just the Streisand effect.
5335960	5338120	Now you're spreading this more openly
5338120	5341280	that the game is emulatable in these emulators.
5341480	5342320	Here's the thing.
5342520	5345960	Here's why I think Kotaku as a gaming,
5346160	5349120	I cannot believe how fucking full circle we've come.
5349320	5351600	Here I am about to defend this website.
5351800	5353640	Look, y'all note the date and time.
5353840	5356640	Here I am about to defend this website.
5356840	5358320	My how far we've come.
5358520	5361360	However, be that as it may.
5361560	5365120	They're making a point is that right now,
5365160	5367560	only like two, three days after release,
5367760	5374720	this game is running better on these emulators than it does on the hardware.
5374920	5376440	So there's point number one.
5376640	5380720	And I think that is a newsworthy point, whether you like it or not.
5380920	5385400	Because technically, you're not supposed to use these emulators if you don't have
5385400	5388760	the software and the way to get the card to read on your computer and all this stuff.
5388960	5391200	Yes, I know who really does that.
5391400	5394880	I know, but that's the way these emulators are supposed to run that,
5394880	5399840	because I have the game, so it would be fun, though, to check it out on like a 4K
5400040	5404520	console or like on a PC and the one I saw them rain in 4K.
5404720	5409080	It's just right now, GTX 1060, like my son's laptop is less
5409280	5412600	respect than mine can run it like 60 FPS.
5412800	5417960	So my like, dang, I can run that at, you know, 4K or something like that.
5418160	5419640	That'd be awesome.
5419840	5423800	And I should be able to do that because I own the software.
5424280	5426600	Here's the other
5426800	5429360	interesting thing about the article.
5429560	5433280	I want to read this part verbatim because I thought this is where they really made
5433480	5437200	this is where they made their point, in my opinion.
5437400	5439720	Thanks to Nintendo's rather poor approach
5439920	5443960	to supporting older games, especially those on the Game Boy Advance and DS,
5444160	5448240	emulation is often the only viable means to play through their collection.
5448440	5451600	And this is the case for much of the Metroid franchise.
5451800	5453440	There are so many good reasons to be
5453640	5456240	grateful for pirates, emulators, modders and hackers.
5456440	5459080	They they may have overeaten at the buffet
5459080	5460720	with that the way that sentence is structured.
5460920	5463000	But let's let's focus on the point
5463200	5467920	for doing what so many big publishers won't keeping old games alive.
5468120	5471240	Clearly, that's not the case for Metroid Dread, a brand new game.
5471440	5473600	But this is an enormous issue Nintendo has
5473800	5478880	to face given the relative technical inferiority of its current console.
5479080	5482520	Now, although I think they overate on the sentence where they said,
5482520	5486360	be grateful for pirates, I think that might have been a little bit oof.
5486560	5488200	Everything else they said in those two
5488400	5492400	paragraphs kind of does a very appropriate dragging of Nintendo.
5492600	5495680	And the fact that, yeah, you you know,
5495880	5500880	everybody's bellyaching for Super Mario RPG to hit the Switch console.
5501080	5503320	So how are you all playing that game right now?
5503400	5505280	How do you know this game is so great?
5505480	5507800	Do you still have a dusty Super Nintendo?
5508360	5509480	SNES classic.
5509680	5514560	No, but so I would say, though, they should be thanking the emulator
5514760	5517920	developers, because that's, I think, a lot of work that
5518120	5520280	those people should be thankful for them.
5520480	5526320	The piracy, not so much, but, you know, means to an end, I guess so.
5526520	5527720	I think it's interesting.
5527720	5529800	I think it raises an interesting discussion.
5530000	5533720	Nintendo, a company that is very sluggish in
5533840	5538240	letting you access its back catalog, now has one of its current catalog games
5538440	5542000	running at a pretty at a technical specification that's
5542000	5545880	better than what the console provides, you know, like be funny in it.
5545880	5547880	And I'm going to tell you, I'm calling it right now.
5548080	5549680	I'm calling it. You're going to see these articles.
5549880	5551040	Get ready.
5551240	5555120	You're going to see the handheld steam system
5555320	5559760	running these games and for, you know, and in a higher resolution or at least
5559760	5562400	better quality than actually, you know, it's the 720p screen.
5562560	5565760	OK, not higher resolution quality, but at least you're going to have
5565960	5570400	better graphic fidelity than, say, a Nintendo Switch.
5570600	5573160	Or at least you'll be able to plug it into something or something like that.
5573360	5578480	But they'll do the comparison between the Steam handheld console and
5578680	5581720	the Nintendo Switch once it comes out.
5581920	5585640	All this being said, I want to stress, unlike the Kotaku article,
5585840	5589120	I do want to stress, buy Metroid Dread if you have an interest in it.
5589120	5590080	It's a good game.
5590120	5591560	And Nintendo and the team that made
5591760	5594640	that game did earn your money for that purchase.
5594640	5596040	So you should go buy this game.
5596240	5599760	If you are using these emulators just to pirate things and play things for free.
5599960	5602240	Well, then.
5602440	5606120	You are the bad people that Twitter is trying to drag right now.
5606320	5610600	OK, so but yeah, so so buy the game.
5610800	5614880	But I think this side of things where, you know, what's interesting,
5614880	5619000	not just Kotaku ran this article, but PC Gamer ran a very similar thing.
5619120	5623680	Why would PC Gamer run an article about the Nintendo Switch?
5623880	5627240	Because it's just very non PC, that's right, this is all running on a PC,
5627440	5630640	so it's just very interesting how that all is coming together.
5630840	5632080	All right. Anyway,
5632280	5635600	let the other thing, the two I see that's more exciting and it's not necessarily
5635800	5639400	talked about yet is all of the modifications that can be
5639600	5642360	done to some of these games in an emulator environment.
5642360	5644640	So like, you know, all the crazy stuff you see with,
5644840	5647080	you know, Breath of the Wild and stuff like that.
5647280	5649400	That's, I think, more exciting.
5649600	5655080	Hell, if people are very dedicated enough, we could put Waluigi in Smash.
5655280	5659120	It could be a reality because they've done similar things to Melee.
5659320	5661680	I'm thinking more along the lines of that
5661880	5664440	accessibility issue I called out early in the show.
5664640	5668040	You make a good point that could be fixed through this.
5668240	5671040	That's a very interesting point to ponder.
5671240	5672440	All right.
5672600	5674920	Is that maybe, maybe
5675120	5678680	that's the only way somebody can actually play this game is through an emulator.
5678880	5681800	Now, again, you need to pay the sixty dollars,
5681800	5685120	have the cartridge and run the emulator the way that it's supposed to be run.
5685320	5688360	But it's a very interesting prospect.
5688560	5690360	All right, moving on.
5690560	5692440	Let's let's talk more about games that we
5692640	5698000	emulate as we take a trip down memory lane in our next segment.
5702440	5703440	And
5708600	5713600	now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and
5713800	5716040	pull out a classic and tell you about it.
5716240	5720240	It's time for the classic game of the week.
5720440	5723040	It's a good one tonight, DarkSakura. What did you pick?
5723240	5725400	I picked System Shock,
5726400	5732960	which is a really groundbreaking game, I believe, you know.
5733160	5737080	System Shock was released on September twenty third, nineteen ninety four.
5737280	5739720	I was in college
5739920	5744520	and it is a first person action adventure game that was developed
5744720	5748920	by Looking Glass Technologies, published by Origin Systems.
5749120	5753760	It is a space station cyberpunk game set
5753960	5755840	in twenty seventy two.
5756040	5761280	You play a security hacker, an unnamed, you know, person,
5761480	5771320	and you are trying to stop a AI called Shodan, S-H-O-D-A-N.
5771520	5777640	But it's the big thing about System Shock is that its 3D engine was really,
5777840	5779840	really
5780600	5785720	new and for the time, really innovative.
5785920	5789560	The physics to it, the gameplay,
5789760	5795720	it was really some of the most influential to be done at its time.
5795920	5800440	And in fact, the the developers actually sort of moved
5800640	5806680	from their previous games to push their own envelope with System Shock.
5806880	5808720	They had also done Ultima Underworld,
5808920	5813320	the Stygian Abyss and Ultima Underworld 2 Labyrinth of Worlds,
5813520	5816800	and they wanted to streamline what they had done to that game,
5817000	5822080	those games to make things more integrated, to make them work better together.
5822280	5825400	It was a real breakthrough at the time.
5826600	5831280	It was, I would say, moderately successful when it came out,
5831480	5834440	but Looking Glass did lose money on the project.
5834640	5836480	However,
5836680	5843200	they did proceed with a sequel and a tertiary release.
5843400	5847240	And there it actually had some
5847440	5852160	spiritual successors, including Deus Ex that came out in 2000,
5852360	5857680	which was produced and directed by Warren Spector, who was
5857880	5860400	the producer for System Shock.
5860600	5863040	And then, of course, Bioshock is also
5863240	5867280	considered a spiritual successor to both of the games.
5867480	5871920	There's actually going to be a remake of System Shock supposedly coming out
5872120	5877720	in this year or is it already out, I don't know, by Nightdive Studios.
5877920	5880240	At any rate, you play the game first person.
5880440	5882920	Like I said, you're in a 3D environment.
5883120	5886760	You have this multi-level space station that you can explore.
5886960	5888880	You have enemies, you have puzzles.
5888920	5892360	It's non-linear, mostly,
5892560	5896800	that will allow emergent gameplay.
5897000	5900160	You can freely move your cursor around to aim objects.
5900360	5902520	It is a PC game, by the way.
5902720	5906280	You can crouch, you can look up, you can crawl.
5906480	5908200	You've got all kinds of different things.
5908400	5914120	And your HUD has three different multifunction displays
5914320	5916560	that you can configure for different information.
5916560	5918440	You have an automap, you have your inventory.
5918920	5921480	Layouts, weapon readouts, you name it.
5921680	5928040	So you advance the plot by getting log disks and getting your emails.
5928240	5932320	There are no NPCs really in the game,
5932520	5937280	but you do also have the AI in the game
5937480	5943160	that traps and blocks pathways and you get certain information to keep going through.
5943360	5946480	You also have this sort of cyberspace
5946520	5950920	that you can go through where you move weightlessly through these
5951120	5953520	wireframe 3D environments that you can use
5953720	5957720	to collect data to fight the security programs by Shodan.
5957920	5960240	It's just really immersive.
5960440	5965160	And then you also get through different weapons and different tools.
5965360	5970280	You'll get a dart pistol, you'll get concussion grenades, land mines,
5970480	5974400	and you also get dermal patches and first aid kits to heal yourself.
5974400	5976880	You get hardware like energy shields
5977080	5981640	and head-mounted lanterns and different things like that.
5983360	5986160	And so basically,
5987040	5991520	the hacker is the hero.
5991720	5995760	So into the design with this game,
5995960	6002080	it was first conceived during the end of the development for Ultima Underworld 2.
6002280	6005720	So around December 92, January 93,
6005920	6011920	the programmer designer, Doug Church, was
6012120	6017080	at the Texas headquarters of Origin Systems and working with Looking Glass
6017280	6022280	Technologies for their next project. And so they kind of put this together,
6022480	6029480	wanted it to be an immersive simulation game, but in a fantasy setting.
6029480	6033680	And then they went for the more cyberpunk,
6033880	6039160	kind of almost wanting to make this a spin off of Wing Commander, but not quite.
6039360	6043360	And so they just put things together.
6043560	6045960	They evolved.
6046160	6050600	They really put things together and out came this.
6050800	6052920	So with its production,
6053120	6058360	it did require a new engine that could do true 3D graphics.
6058440	6063920	They just chucked the Ultima engine and coded one from scratch.
6064120	6069200	They used Wacom C++ and 32-bit code.
6069400	6071840	Their new engine could process texture mapping.
6072040	6075200	It could use sloped architecture, light emitting objects.
6075400	6078000	You could look in any direction.
6078200	6081520	It allowed for improved player physics,
6081720	6087520	including the jumping, crawling, climbing mechanics.
6087760	6091040	They found limitations in their engine
6091240	6094640	so that they could push the envelope for what it was able to do.
6094840	6096840	They did have 3D character models
6096840	6099600	enabled, but they couldn't implement it on their schedule.
6099800	6101600	They had triggered events.
6101800	6104520	It was really something major for its day.
6104720	6109000	The wireframe mechanics were actually, I thought, a really good touch for sort of
6109200	6116200	that floating feeling that you were moving through a virtual space.
6116200	6120080	So the first release of this came out
6120280	6123600	on floppy disks and had no support for spoken dialog.
6123800	6127080	Later on, that was September 1994.
6127280	6131800	A CD-ROM version was released in December 1994 that had full speech
6132000	6135480	for the logs and the emails, the multiple display resolutions,
6135680	6142200	more detailed graphics, and of course, it is considered to be the superior version.
6142880	6149040	So they wanted to
6149240	6153600	to actually do these sort of audio vignettes that they
6153800	6157160	and they really didn't want to do the floppy version.
6157360	6161120	They just wanted the CD one to go out, but
6161320	6164520	they had to get something out for release in September.
6164720	6166880	So that's why it came out with that.
6167080	6170720	It sold over 170,000 copies.
6171720	6177320	It was successful, but not enough to keep looking glass afloat as a company
6177520	6182480	because it had another competitor, Doom.
6182680	6186080	And we know what Doom did,
6186280	6189080	but it got a lot of praise for how
6189280	6193240	technologically advanced it was and how much more complex it was,
6193440	6195720	complicated and complex it was than Doom.
6195920	6199200	And it was considered to be worth the time
6199240	6203720	it took to play the game, to explore it, to go.
6203920	6205520	And there's people because, you know,
6205520	6209200	when you release a sort of game at the same time and the other popular,
6209400	6212800	people will try to find the similarities between them.
6213000	6217520	But this was
6217720	6219880	more elaborate, more complicated.
6220080	6223880	And even some of the some of the reviewers out there said you have to read
6223880	6227040	the manual before you can actually get into the game and that it had a higher
6227240	6230560	system requirement with, of course, all those complex controls.
6230560	6234920	For me, I would even more put this a little bit more into the realm of dissent
6235120	6241320	for, you know, later on for things that kind of had that complication.
6241520	6244320	It blended strategy with action.
6244320	6245920	You couldn't just go run and gun it.
6246120	6247680	You had to think about playing it.
6247880	6253480	You know, it was a it was a thinking game.
6253680	6255560	Um.
6255760	6258080	I'll just say it's interesting that you
6258280	6262560	bring up that Doom comparison, because my memory goes, oh,
6262560	6265880	this was one of those many games that came out because it was, you know,
6265880	6269440	inspired by Doom and everything that was happening in the 3D genre at that time.
6269440	6272440	It's interesting the tricks that our memory will play on us.
6272640	6275520	But you're you're probably very right in that, you know,
6275520	6278440	Doom was something you just, you know, run and gun, pick it up.
6278440	6279480	There were contemporaries.
6279680	6284120	There was there was much more thinking in this game that maybe made it harder
6284160	6286480	to just and that doesn't make it worse or anything.
6286680	6288480	It just made it a little harder to get into.
6288680	6294680	And I think maybe that's why our brains don't equate this from of the exact same
6294680	6297480	era and not one inspired by the other necessarily.
6297680	6300280	Well, and it was also a lot more graphically complex.
6300480	6303000	I mean, it was the.
6303200	6307560	If you look at it, the specification graphic wise, story wise,
6307760	6309040	it's the superior game.
6309240	6310080	Yeah.
6310240	6316560	And it really did set a lot of things that we take for granted in our games today,
6316760	6319640	like immersive simulation,
6319840	6325640	the whole emergent gameplay style where as you go, you learn more and new things happen.
6325840	6328880	And I mean, and again, without this, we wouldn't have Bioshock.
6329080	6330240	We wouldn't have Deus Ex.
6330440	6333600	We wouldn't have Thief, you know.
6333800	6335920	Of course, there was a sequel.
6336080	6340960	System Shock 2 came out by Looking Glass and Irrational Games in 1999.
6341160	6344240	It really played a lot more on that one.
6344240	6346000	And then, of course, Looking Glass closed
6346200	6349600	and the rights fell to the Meadowbrook Insurance Group,
6349800	6353120	which is a subsidiary of Star Insurance Company.
6353320	6356920	And it was then acquired by Nightdive Studios
6357120	6361760	and they distributed the game and the rights for System Shock at all.
6362000	6366200	And they had a plan to release the source code,
6366400	6371080	but they did a third game in 2015 called System Shock 3.
6371280	6372160	Sorry, I take that back.
6372360	6376400	That was developed by Otherside Entertainment.
6377280	6383400	And yeah, there's it was not as well received as any of the others.
6383600	6387680	So Nightdive Studios, being that they own the rights to System Shock are planning
6387680	6393480	on doing well, they did System Shock Enhanced Edition that came out
6393680	6399800	on GOG on September 22nd, 2015 for Windows.
6400000	6402120	The version
6402320	6407440	needed definitely some more improvements to boost up the resolution.
6407640	6412120	It also does include the original version of the game, which is System Shock Classic
6412320	6417880	with support for Windows OS X and Linux, Mac OS X.
6418080	6420480	It received really positive reviews,
6420680	6426080	but Nightdive Studios wants to do a reimagining of System Shock to come out
6426280	6432920	for Windows, Xbox One and PlayStation 4 using Unreal Engine 4.
6433120	6434440	But
6434640	6437760	there's not really, I think, a whole lot else about that.
6437800	6440160	But Otherside Entertainment also wants
6440360	6444040	to acquire the license to System Shock
6444240	6449040	to improve on System Shock 3 to redevelop it.
6449240	6455760	But the Mac version source code was released by Nightdive Studios on GitHub.
6455960	6459640	And there is also
6460360	6462200	a
6462400	6466200	after a month of development, there's a cross platform source port called
6466360	6468080	Shocklet
6468280	6471400	that has been released for developers.
6471600	6475000	So there we go. That is the state of the System Shock.
6475200	6476240	Good pick, Dark Sakura.
6476240	6479840	This is one that, you know, I knew of this game and I think I even may have played
6479840	6482440	it a little bit, but I think it was one of those games I was probably pretty easily
6482440	6485520	overwhelmed with because, yeah, that would have been right around the time, too.
6485520	6488080	It would have been like either early college or late high school for me.
6488280	6490200	And I probably blew this game off pretty quickly.
6490400	6492880	But it is very interesting how much this
6492880	6496320	was brought to the table that wasn't on the table yet,
6496520	6501320	but then kind of became a part of it much later on, if that makes sense.
6501520	6503160	So, no, indeed. All right.
6503360	6507160	Well, there it is. Classic game of the week is System Shock.
6507360	6512920	All right. Let's get to our next segment and some rapid fire news.
6513120	6515560	Just real quick, housekeeping note.
6515760	6520240	We will be here next week and next week will be episode number 888,
6520360	6522760	which is a bit of a lucky number there, so that'll be fun.
6522960	6524520	So we will be here next week.
6524720	6529680	We will not be here in two weeks live as I will be out.
6529680	6533600	I'm going to actually be at Disneyland in two weeks, so I can't wait.
6533800	6535600	And then three weeks is Halloween.
6535600	6537080	So we're still trying to work out the plan.
6537280	6542920	I think I will be on Twitch that night one way or another because I don't do anything.
6543120	6544840	I mean, I do things for Halloween.
6544840	6546840	I'm actually hosting two shows that weekend.
6547040	6548440	So shout out for local folks.
6549000	6552240	Well, Rocky Horror is almost sold out now, but I think there's like 10 seats left.
6552440	6554320	If you want to try and get a general mission ticket
6554520	6557440	at the Colonial on that Saturday, the 30th.
6557640	6559280	So I have plans Friday.
6559480	6562800	I'm hosting another show, a burlesque variety show that Friday night.
6563000	6564520	Then I'm hosting Rocky that Saturday.
6564520	6566840	So it's weird to be talking about hosting shows again, but hooray.
6567040	6569280	But then Sunday, I'm not doing anything on Halloween.
6569320	6572160	So I will have gotten Halloween out of my system the other two nights.
6572160	6574520	So I'll be here. But, Loki, I know you have kids and you
6574520	6578200	might not be able to get out of the show that easy or get out of it to do the show that easy.
6578200	6580280	I don't know where Jamie's at, so we'll see.
6580280	6583840	I'll be here on Twitch one way or the other, but we'll see where my co-hosts are.
6584040	6585240	So. All right.
6585440	6588720	If we can't all be here together, we'll try to do a show throughout the week
6588920	6590320	or something, so we have that.
6590520	6593080	OK, um, rapid fire news.
6593080	6595200	Now we can get into it. Loki.
6596840	6599240	You're muted.
6599440	6600800	I need I swear I hit the button.
6600800	6602800	I know I need a big neon alert.
6602800	6604600	All right. Oh, I didn't realize that there's a new
6604600	6607600	Doctor Who premiering on ten thirty one, says Pod Culture.
6607800	6610640	Oh, I now I see where you all got to be.
6610640	6613120	All right, go ahead.
6613320	6617960	So as we've been kind of getting rumors that this might be coming,
6618160	6625680	we finally got an official announcement that, yes, the Grand Theft Auto trilogy
6625880	6628800	was a definitive edition and, you know, there's a subtitle.
6629000	6634520	Yeah, the definitive edition is going to be released later this year by Rockstar Games.
6634720	6636160	Yes, Rockstar Games,
6636360	6641760	the infamous company that likes to perpetuate the old Grand Theft Auto games
6641760	6643760	and doesn't make new Grand Theft Auto games anymore.
6643960	6648000	But they're going to have the old ones release again.
6648200	6649360	And am I excited about it?
6649560	6657040	No, because I already have Grand Theft Auto Vice City and three and San Andreas.
6657240	6661440	But Loki, these are the definitive editions.
6661560	6662960	You
6663240	6667680	they will have done literally nothing to it, I'm sure.
6667880	6669200	So that's the thing.
6669400	6672400	Look forward to that, I guess, or something.
6672600	6678400	And then to make things even more exciting, the Avengers game.
6678600	6680560	You remember that game by Eidos?
6680760	6682160	Well, I do.
6682360	6685800	I was going to download it and then it was one hundred and ninety gigabytes to get
6686000	6690160	that on Game Pass and I was like, so, yeah, go check it out if it's on Game Pass.
6690400	6693920	But cloud games, I might try it through the cloud gaming thing.
6694120	6694760	It's on there, too.
6694960	6697320	So there was a thing that they had done.
6697320	6701400	They did some tweaks to leveling in the game because they thought it was too easy
6701600	6706240	to get to a higher level in the game, and so they had tweaked the leveling
6706440	6710600	to make it harder to level up and people didn't like that.
6710800	6711880	Like what? You know that.
6712080	6715400	But they're like, well, it's maybe confusing,
6715600	6718880	overwhelming to newer players that they're leveling too fast.
6719080	6720880	Well, now
6721280	6725440	apparently it comes out that, well, the reason why they probably did that is
6725640	6729480	because they're selling XP boosts now so that you can level up faster.
6729680	6730240	That's right.
6730440	6735840	They're providing a solution at a cost to a problem that they created.
6736640	6741880	That's your triple A capitalist game mentality.
6742080	6743720	Another reason not to play this game.
6743920	6745920	So, all right, we'll get to it.
6746120	6748560	We'll get to Jamie's rapid fire news stories in just a moment.
6748560	6750200	But first, I'm looking at chat for some
6750400	6752640	comments over at Twitch.TV slash VOG Network.
6752840	6755280	S.H.O. 100 Matt says GTA 6 is never going
6755280	6757640	to live up to the hype whenever it when it ever comes out.
6757840	6758680	Do you think that's the first?
6758880	6763440	Do you think Grand Theft Auto 6 can possibly live up to this hype of many years?
6763640	6765320	You do? Yes.
6765520	6768120	Grand Theft Auto 5 lived up to the hype and 4 was amazing.
6768320	6769800	So I don't see why not.
6770000	6771960	Except for the multiplayer.
6772160	6777200	Well, you know, the multiplayer in 5 is all it's just.
6777400	6780000	I don't necessarily like the sandbox multiplayer.
6780200	6784640	I liked how 4 had the option, like if you want the sandbox multiplayer,
6784840	6788920	you can do that, or if you want it, you know, specific just levels or whatever
6789120	6791360	to do like a deathmatch and you could do that.
6791560	6796000	I liked how you had like options and they still kind of have that in this.
6796200	6798280	But it's.
6798480	6805280	It's clearly meant to force you to grind for money, and they clearly built it
6805280	6807120	in a way to push those shark cards.
6807320	6809680	And fortunately, based on the revenue
6809680	6812160	that they're making with Grand Theft Auto Online, it's working.
6812360	6816520	And so that's a problem is once you've given them such an easy source of cash,
6816720	6819240	they're going to keep perpetuating that, unfortunately.
6819240	6820880	And so they're not really motivated
6821080	6824760	to make a new game until they've run this one dry.
6824960	6828680	It's the Activision of the music game worlds or anything that they,
6828880	6834240	you know, Activision touches Rockstar Games is kind of learning that lesson
6834440	6839360	themselves where they are just going to milk this until they, you know, trillionaires.
6839560	6843920	And so we will probably see a Grand Theft Auto six until Grand Theft Auto Online
6844120	6846600	and Grand Theft Auto five's numbers drop.
6846800	6848280	They're working on it, who knows?
6848480	6851280	Before we get to Jamie stories, Tiger Claw on chat says, oh,
6851480	6853760	you guys didn't mention about the trailer for Resident Evil.
6853960	6855280	Welcome to Raccoon City.
6855480	6860360	It's because I so rarely get into TV shows and Netflix movies and that stuff anymore.
6860960	6863520	I full on meant I sat down
6863720	6868160	on Friday night because I was very bored and I full on meant to start Squid Game
6868160	6870080	because everybody's talking about Squid Games.
6870080	6871120	I want to watch that.
6871120	6872760	Everybody's been talking about it nonstop.
6872960	6874800	But maybe we should watch it together, Jamie.
6875000	6876600	Let's do it. Oh, my God.
6876800	6878360	Let's have a live reaction.
6878560	6881960	I don't I don't think we can do that because we can't show the show.
6881960	6883360	We could just show ourselves. I don't know.
6883480	6885200	Yeah, we'll show ourselves talking shit about it.
6885400	6887520	But anyway, here's the thing.
6887560	6890600	No, I meant to watch it, but then you know what happened?
6890800	6897440	Instead, on my suggestion that Leah Remini escaping Scientology thing came up.
6897640	6901520	I watched like four episodes of that in a night.
6901720	6903960	It was compelling, God damn it.
6904160	6906920	Anyway, it's so interesting.
6907120	6909800	Anyway, let's see.
6910000	6911240	Can I do my stuff now?
6911440	6913080	Yes, you can do your stuff now.
6913240	6916800	OK, so there is going to be an Animal
6917000	6923400	Crossing direct scheduled on Brewster's birthday, or as he is known in
6923600	6927760	in the Japanese version, Maestro, I believe it's either Maestro or Maestro.
6927960	6929360	I'll have to look it up again.
6929560	6932480	But anyway, it's going to be on the Nintendo YouTube
6932680	6937040	channel on October 15th, and I finally have a reason to play the game again.
6937240	6939000	Because Brewster.
6939200	6942520	I have a Brewster plushie like somewhere behind me, so
6942720	6945680	anyway, and you have a catch up.
6945880	6949360	I do have a catch up, and I'm also very excited for this direct because I want
6949560	6954480	reasons to go back and visit my town because I abandoned them about a year ago.
6954680	6961680	Well, there is also a new addition to the arcade archives for Namco,
6961880	6967840	the the Genji and Heike clan is joining in amongst those.
6968040	6970240	So you will.
6970480	6975480	And for anyone who doesn't know anything about the Genji and Heike clans,
6975680	6981360	it actually is going back from like really old Japanese literature.
6981560	6985240	So but it's it's a really honestly,
6985440	6990480	it's a really beautiful game and I'm glad to see it in there.
6990680	6992400	Yeah, it's interesting that this arcade
6992600	6995480	archives has gone so deep now, we're really getting into these
6995680	6999320	underappreciated classics, you know, this is pretty, pretty cool.
6999480	7000320	All right.
7000520	7003320	Certain games that didn't see a lot of light in the US.
7003520	7004760	Yeah.
7004960	7006000	That's very true.
7006200	7007560	All right, let's travel around the world
7007560	7010640	and check out some release dates and some games that are coming out real soon.
7010840	7012920	Loki, we'll start in the US with you.

7082160	7084000	That is it.
7084200	7088040	Going to Japan and looking at the releases there on the Switch on October 14th,
7088040	7091360	we have Monarch in regular and limited edition coming out of Japan.
7091560	7093480	We have a game called Fight of Animals.
7093480	7095400	Arena is coming out as well in Japan.
7095600	7097520	I know this game exists here.
7097720	7100040	Is it the same name here?
7100240	7101120	Fight of Animals?
7101320	7105080	It's Smash Brothers, but with like really overly character.
7105280	7109560	I think it is. OK, I don't remember the name of it, but yeah, it's over here.
7109600	7111560	OK, it's like a cat, but the cat is like
7111760	7115840	super muscle cat and like it's just Smash Brothers with all these animals.
7115960	7116920	There's a whale in it.
7117120	7120080	It looks that I don't know if it's the same name.
7120080	7121320	It's what Brutal should have been.
7121520	7124720	I know I've seen this game over here because I was thinking, oh,
7124720	7127760	that would be a fun thing to pick up. But Japan's getting it this week.
7127960	7132440	Earth Defense Force 3 gets its Nintendo Switch release this week over in Japan.
7132640	7135160	And I think that is it for the Switch.
7135360	7138440	So let me quickly take a look at the PlayStation 5
7138640	7140200	and look at the releases there.
7140400	7142680	If I can ever get down to.
7144160	7147400	Sorry, I need an actual mouse for this thing I'm using now.
7147600	7151560	It's the worst to have to use a touchpad touchpad.
7152560	7158040	OK, on the PlayStation 5, we have Demon Slayer, Kimetsu no Yaiba,
7158240	7162240	Hinokami Kaputan comes out this week, and that is on the PlayStation 5.
7162440	7166760	And the Monarch is also seeing a PlayStation 5 release this week.
7166960	7168480	That's it.
7169080	7171560	So how about the UK, Dark Soccer?
7174200	7178440	On the UK, we have on the 12th, we have
7178640	7181240	Shuan Yan Sword 7.
7181440	7187480	That's going to be PlayStation, Xbox also the same day, same systems back for blood.
7187680	7194600	On the 14th, we have the Rift Breaker, same systems, 15th, NHL 22,
7194800	7199520	Crisis Remastered, Demon Slayer, Kimetsu no Yaiba,
7199720	7205160	I got tongue tied, Kimetsu no Yaiba, the Hinokami Chronicles.
7205360	7210920	We have also on the 15th, Story of Seasons, Friends of Mineral Town,
7211120	7214640	and then Just Die Already.
7214840	7216520	On a bunch of stuff.
7217760	7220000	All right, is that it?
7220200	7222960	That's it. I will have you know, I looked up that animal game.
7222960	7225520	It is also called Fight of Animals here locally.
7225520	7226720	That's what I thought. Yeah.
7226920	7229080	And actually, it's been out. I think it's on Steam.
7229280	7233360	It is. It is on Steam and it went up on Steam December of 2019.
7233560	7235000	So this game's been out a little while.
7235000	7237800	It's just Japan is getting a Switch release of it this week.
7238000	7240280	So I'm like, I knew I've seen this game around.
7240480	7241840	I might have to get it on Switch.
7241880	7242960	Yeah, that'd be a lot of fun.
7243160	7244920	So, yeah. All right.
7245120	7247800	We are going to now get back into some news.
7248000	7250840	We're also going to invite your phone calls later in the show,
7251040	7253840	as well as possibly any emails, if we actually got any.
7254040	7258160	Participate at Orangelandtrady.com if you want to be old school and send an email.
7258360	7260000	But send an email for now.
7260200	7261600	We have a few more stories.
7261800	7262760	Loki.
7262960	7267920	Yeah, so right now, the Ryoga Gotoku
7268120	7271480	studio, the developer, of course, behind the Yakuza series,
7271480	7273000	they're going through a restructure right now.
7273200	7277360	They've had some folks leaving the studio,
7277520	7285080	including the departure of the series creator and game director, Tosho.
7285280	7288720	I'm going to let me butcher some Japanese names.
7288920	7292560	Toshihiro Nagoshi.
7292760	7298240	He has left, as well as the.
7298440	7301880	Was it the former series producer as well in the in the creator?
7301880	7303320	So.
7304800	7307680	That's quite a few people leaving
7307880	7309680	and then, of course, along with this,
7309880	7313720	we did get the news that there is going to be a sequel to Yakuza,
7313720	7317600	like a dragon, which I'm very excited about and I actually need to finish that game.
7317800	7320000	But yeah, a little bit of a restructure
7320200	7323760	with some of those big heads of the company leaving.
7326520	7327640	But.
7327840	7328920	I'm excited for the series.
7329080	7331040	Yeah, looking in chat, S.J. 100 Matt says,
7331040	7333400	at least they said like a dragon two is still happening.
7333600	7335600	Maybe I'll be like a dragon one by them.
7335800	7339000	Big mood, Matt, because I still have Bobby.
7339200	7342680	Bobby is like hiding in the bushes outside going, you beat like a dragon yet?
7342880	7345160	You played like a dragon yet?
7345360	7347560	So I need to I need to know.
7347760	7350600	I have one game I own on the Xbox Series X.
7350800	7354680	I need to be I need to be careful because I don't want to pass that point where I
7354680	7357720	can't just pick up where I left off and I have to start all over again,
7357880	7360160	because, you know, it be like that with some RPGs.
7360280	7363720	If you let it go for too long, then you're like, where was I at in the story?
7363920	7365840	Ah, fuck it. I'll start from the beginning.
7366040	7367480	Maybe I'll maybe I'll do things different.
7367680	7370040	Maybe I'll know to save three million yen this time.
7370240	7374880	So anyway, I need I need to watch myself and get back into that soon.
7375080	7377480	Maybe Bobby, maybe I'm not going to promise,
7377680	7382000	but maybe that'll be a game that I do a stream of next week.
7382200	7384280	We'll see. I'm not going to stream Monday because
7384280	7388920	Jamie's got her thing going on, but maybe maybe one of the other days I stream.
7388920	7390440	I still want to do another play through a dread.
7390440	7392400	So maybe it'll be later in the week, like a Thursday, Friday thing.
7392600	7394720	We'll see. All right.
7395560	7398320	Anyhow, let's move on
7398520	7401240	and talk about this. Oh, talk about adding games to the backlog.
7401440	7406400	Well, here we go. A long running rumor on Orange Launch Radio and really here at all
7406600	7410120	of VOG Network finally coming to fruition this week as we have had
7410160	7414640	the confirmation that a Tron arcade one up is happening.
7414840	7416760	But that's actually not the leading
7416760	7420880	headline for a lot of sites reporting on this, because a lot of people are catching
7421080	7425560	the fact that Ridge Racer is also one of the cabinets that's being released.
7425760	7427600	Loki's asked many times on this program.
7427600	7429360	I think Dark Soccer's asked it, too, quite frankly.
7429560	7431400	When are we getting a new Ridge Racer?
7431600	7434560	Well, here's something.
7434760	7437560	It's something. It's not new.
7437760	7440880	Anyway, Arcade One Up is doing a Ridge Racer cabinet.
7441080	7442280	It has five games in it.
7442480	7448440	Ridge Racer, Ridge Racer 2, Rave Racer, Ace Driver and Ace Driver Victory Lap.
7448640	7450160	So that's kind of neat.
7450360	7453480	Also, what's interesting, some of those games
7453680	7457000	have not been on home consoles or even PC.
7457200	7458880	So this is really the first time you can
7459080	7462080	have them in your house, which is kind of awesome.
7462280	7464680	So this is really the only way you can do
7464720	7468960	this and play these games unless you happen to own the arcade machines.
7469160	7472280	It's especially noted that Rave Racer is
7472480	7475960	kind of a neat entry to be here in this particular list.
7476160	7477640	That's pretty cool. Yeah.
7477840	7480200	Dark Soccer. They're not R4.
7480400	7484960	When do we get the Wangan Midnight Maximum Tune Arcade One Up cabinet?
7485160	7487400	I wish. Those are a little too recent.
7487600	7489800	I well, yeah, they're up to like number eight.
7489800	7493640	I think when I was at round one last, I saw initial D is like on eight or nine
7493680	7495120	and Wangan's around the same number.
7495320	7497200	I'm like, I'm so old or I'll take it.
7497400	7503800	I'll take it. Then I then I launched 2DX 28 style and I was like back in my day.
7505840	7509520	And then I went on to the local Discord and saw that they were talking about they
7509720	7514640	couldn't play a game because one of the Bahmani Boomers was hogging the machine.
7514840	7516520	Somebody actually used that term.
7516640	7517880	I don't think they were talking about me
7517880	7519880	because when I was there, like nobody else there.
7520000	7522520	But I I fucking laughed my ass off.
7522720	7524920	Dark Soccer Loki were Bahmani Boomers.
7525120	7526760	Did you know that?
7527280	7529760	At least they have a name for us now.
7530600	7532120	They still know how to play Deluxe.
7532320	7535320	That person got yelled at and said, don't use that term and all that stuff.
7535320	7537360	And so I was like, OK, they're behaving.
7537560	7538600	I think it's funny.
7538800	7540400	Yeah, I think it's funny, too, actually.
7540600	7542280	So it's just it's just so funny.
7542480	7547840	It's it's interesting for me to think there are all these like DDR and Bahmani
7547840	7550800	or at least there's I know of at least one that's been brought to my attention.
7550800	7551760	I think there might be two.
7551960	7554160	There's podcasts now about that.
7554360	7556360	And they're probably did it first.
7556360	7557680	I know they're probably doing those
7557880	7560960	shows thinking no one's ever done this before.
7561160	7564920	We did, but I think and no one I think it's adorable.
7564920	7566560	I think it's adorable. You know what?
7566760	7571360	I'm always about going to the next generation and all that stuff.
7571560	7575080	Maybe they will find that same love we did
7575080	7578200	and end up continuing their show 20 years later about all sorts of things.
7578200	7579960	So we'll still be doing ours.
7580160	7584360	All right. Anyway, speaking of things, boomers like we
7584560	7588000	also have Tron that cabinet is officially happening.
7588200	7591160	Yay. Also, Killer Instinct is also and I
7591160	7592840	bet there's a lot of people interested in that one, too.
7592840	7594880	That is a cabinet that's happening as well.
7595080	7598760	Killer Instinct also comes with Battletoads.
7598960	7600480	So that's like a combo thing.
7600480	7601760	The arcade battle rare.
7601960	7604640	Yeah. So that's pretty cool.
7604880	7607360	Tron preorders begin October 19th.
7607560	7609560	It also has discs of Tron.
7609760	7612360	Here's the thing. Yes, this has been brought to my attention.
7612560	7614040	Somebody sent me the target listing.
7614240	7617880	The target listing was like seven hundred dollars and.
7618080	7620280	I just I can't I can't spend that right now.
7620280	7623520	It's like you could buy the actual cabinet for that kind of money.
7623720	7625440	Yeah, an actual cabinet.
7625640	7628880	Look, I would spoil myself rotten anyway.
7628880	7630840	I like the idea of the whole black light
7630840	7632960	refractive, which I think the original cabinet had.
7633000	7635720	I fully expect when I visit Bobby Blackwolf
7635920	7638880	for Dragon Con twenty twenty two and go to his arcade again.
7638880	7640880	I guess I just invited myself to Bobby's house again.
7641080	7643640	But I fully expect I'll get to play that Tron machine.
7643840	7646200	I know he'll have it in his house.
7646400	7651920	And Bobby is pointing out you cannot buy the actual cabinet, not one that works.
7652120	7654800	They those older machines are getting more expensive.
7654800	7656440	It's because of the TVs in them.
7656640	7659240	They're they're getting impossible to replace these days.
7659440	7661200	Yeah, I know all about that.
7661200	7662040	Yeah, exactly.
7662080	7663080	So that's what's happening.
7663280	7668400	Probably Loki, probably 10 years ago when like we were at the auction out
7668400	7670960	in Roseville looking at these cabinets, you're right.
7671160	7675120	I distinctly remember passing up a burger time machine for four hundred dollars.
7675320	7677400	And I could have bought a burger time
7677400	7680160	machine that worked for less money than what I ultimately bought.
7680160	7682880	You just have to get money with private sellers.
7683080	7685640	That's how I got my DDR cabinet.
7685840	7689120	You just get you get someone that just doesn't care.
7689320	7691480	They just want a certain amount of money for it.
7691520	7695520	Like to them, it's just it's just better to get rid of it at that point.
7695720	7696760	You can get lucky.
7696960	7700640	So anyway, I have some major financial
7700640	7703840	things that I haven't gotten into detail on the show yet.
7703840	7705240	I will eventually, I promise.
7705440	7709200	But there's just some stuff I have to save up for and make happen.
7709400	7713560	And so seven hundred bucks out of that just I don't I just don't realistically
7713560	7714960	think it's going to happen, unfortunately.
7715160	7716760	If it's meant to happen, it'll happen.
7716960	7719200	If, say, February, those machines are still
7719240	7722640	available and I still have the money, then, yes, I'll pick one up.
7722840	7727200	But if they're gone, it's sold out, then I guess it wasn't meant to happen.
7727400	7729920	And I'll just hope that there's a reissue,
7729920	7733240	like they've reissued some of those Namco machines 20 times over.
7733240	7735880	I'm just going to have to cross my fingers and toes for that.
7736080	7740760	After all, a lot of games ran on that Tron hardware that that hardware was
7740960	7745640	the Bally Midway stuff that ran a journey.
7745800	7749680	So that's what I'll hold out hope for is a Tron slash journey cabinet.
7749880	7755480	Yes, the old band that ended up having a arcade game in the those.
7755680	7757880	There's a lot of games on that hardware.
7758080	7759880	Check out those Midway arcade treasures.
7760000	7762160	Tron was never in there because of the Disney thing,
7762360	7766840	but a lot of games ran on that hardware.
7767360	7770440	Bobby's pointing out the TV and the joystick.
7770640	7774560	Tron used a very unique, yeah, yeah, yeah.
7774720	7776960	So the replica will be very nice to have, I think.
7776960	7779040	I think it would just be nice to have like a newer one.
7779240	7781000	So. All right.
7781200	7784120	Yeah, dark to see a points out there's problems with the journey cabinet
7784320	7787720	because journey's changed their lead singer a couple of times now.
7787920	7790440	So it would get complicated.
7790640	7794000	Do they still have the guy with the pretty hair?
7794520	7796640	I think his name is Arnelle or Artell.
7796640	7797560	I'm sorry, I forgot his name.
7797760	7800560	But yes, he's he's still the guy that's been like him.
7800760	7803520	He's been there for almost 10 years now.
7803720	7806880	We we saw him when he was new.
7807080	7808960	Yeah, no, I know, I know when we went to see Journey.
7809080	7811000	Yeah, was that the one where Heart opened?
7811000	7815000	And the reason why I'll never go back to that cheap trick, cheap trick opened.
7815200	7819280	And then Heart, we missed cheap trick because of the parking, remember?
7819480	7821560	But we could hear Heart from the parking lot here.
7821560	7824040	Heart, that pissed me off so much. I'll never go back to that venue.
7824240	7824760	All right. Yeah.
7824960	7827880	But I think I was like singing with everything that Heart did.
7828080	7829320	Of course, of course.
7829520	7831080	Thank you. VX chase next to me.
7831120	7833360	Arnell Pineda, that's his name.
7833560	7836120	Yes, he's he's still the guy that he's great.
7836320	7839360	And he sounds just like Steve Perry.
7839560	7841240	Yeah. Yeah.
7841440	7845560	All right, moving on, Dark Sakura.
7845760	7850880	So this is something that actually I think I think is very important to me in
7851080	7859200	particular, but there is a a group called AbleGamers that have put
7859200	7864680	out some criticized different companies for their lack of accessibility options.
7864880	7866560	And so
7867160	7868720	now
7868920	7873680	there is an attempt to try to help disabled gamers find games that they can play.
7873880	7876320	There's a nonprofit organization called
7876520	7880680	Dagger System that created the Accessible Games Database.
7880880	7886640	So in a nutshell, it includes right now 144 games with their accessibility
7886640	7891840	options, including Last of Us Part Two, Control, Cyberpunk 2077, Tetris 99.
7892040	7897520	People can search by publisher, genre and platform and you can filter for auditory
7897720	7899720	visual and motor features.
7899920	7902920	So it has like other different subcategories.
7903120	7905200	But I think it's really neat.
7905200	7906240	The filters aren't final.
7906440	7912320	It's still a little bit in development, but I think it will be really useful to
7912320	7916520	have something like this for gamers who have limitations in playing.
7916720	7918800	This is great. This is one of those things where I'm kind
7918800	7922440	of surprised it didn't exist already and maybe it kind of did in like Google
7922440	7925000	documents that were circulating around and things like that.
7925000	7927800	But I think it's nice that we have like a very comprehensive site.
7928000	7930360	Jaskren in our chat says AbleGamers.
7930560	7932760	Hell yeah, I give you I wholeheartedly agree.
7932760	7933920	Hell yeah.
7934120	7936720	I think that's still the charity I have set on my Amazon right now.
7936920	7939120	So, you know,
7939280	7942920	I'm glad to see they're involved with such awesome projects still.
7942920	7944800	I mean, I know they show up a lot of conventions.
7945000	7947800	They do a lot of consulting and things of that nature.
7948000	7949880	So good on them.
7950080	7952520	Pat's on the back. Job well done.
7952720	7954680	You're doing good, son.
7954880	7957840	The Bamani Boomer says you're doing good, son.
7958040	7961040	You're making me proud. All right.
7961240	7963040	Jeez. All right.
7963240	7965840	Then let's move on, Loki.
7966040	7967120	Yep.
7967320	7969880	So this is kind of exciting and we kind
7969880	7972760	of figured this would happen with any new game that comes out,
7972960	7978800	but people have been data mining Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl and found files
7979000	7984280	they're hinting at the new future characters that may be coming in DLC.
7984480	7987000	So some of the things that I thought were
7987200	7993360	kind of funny is they had a character, there's a bunch of files for cheese.
7993560	7999040	And of course, that has to do with Shredder, which I thought was pretty funny.
7999240	8002680	Some other stuff, you know, we had references to Mr.
8002880	8009120	Krabs, Squidward, Plankton, Tommy Pickles, Jimmy Neutron and Rocko
8009320	8014840	from Rocko's Modern Life also listed in there.
8015040	8017520	They said that, you know,
8017720	8021600	the actual community manager for the game, Thaddeus Cruz,
8021800	8026280	said that some of the leaks, you know, or some of the concerns that they had
8026480	8032400	with these types of leaks is that it doesn't necessarily mean that the content
8032600	8034880	was removed. It could have been stuff that they were
8035080	8038600	considering, just didn't end up putting in the game.
8038800	8040400	You know, they said it wasn't removed.
8040600	8044240	This is voice lines in the project, a covered voice lines in the project,
8044440	8049760	cover bases and are not to be the end or be all end all confirmations of what can
8049800	8052080	and cannot happen.
8052280	8053880	So.
8054320	8057160	Yeah, I'm curious to see what DLC they're going to have for this game.
8057160	8059240	I think it's gonna be pretty cool.
8060320	8064040	Yeah, I'm going to admit, even though I shaded the game a little bit earlier
8064240	8065840	earlier in the show, I've just seen it.
8066040	8070360	Oh, and when I missed here, they also had a reference to a Garfield stage.
8070560	8072040	Oh, God.
8072240	8074280	Has it made a lasagna?
8074480	8077320	So I honestly haven't played the game.
8077320	8079440	I've just been hearing things about the game.
8079480	8082320	And I did watch one of a streamer.
8082320	8085160	You like to Dark Soccer Lapin, the guy up in Vancouver.
8085160	8087040	He was playing this Nickelodeon game.
8087040	8089760	And I was kind of looking at it, but I was kind of looking at it.
8089960	8092040	Yeah, it was late one night.
8092240	8095840	But anyway, I did when I was watching him play it.
8096040	8100440	I was kind of like, this does feel a little bit like just in the setup
8100440	8101440	and the menus and everything.
8101640	8104760	This is very like bare bones, like knock off Smash Brothers.
8104880	8106360	But then when they got into the fight
8106360	8109040	and everything, it looked like it was cute, but it did look I've heard it's
8109040	8114520	a little bit sluggish and doesn't it feels like it is a copy of Smash
8114720	8117080	Brothers and not the real thing, if that makes sense.
8117280	8118720	So, yeah.
8118920	8120680	But you know what?
8120680	8123600	I think the reason why people are still enjoying it and I think it will show up
8123600	8126760	in competitive events and I think they'll probably continue to improve it.
8126960	8132200	The roster is strong and a lot of what you just kind of added to that, even me.
8132400	8136360	Boomer can go in and look and I'm like, oh,
8136400	8140720	I recognize I recognize Ren Stimpy, Invader Zim, powdered toast, man.
8140720	8141680	Like there was a lot of characters.
8141680	8144040	I was like, OK, even my old ass knows these characters.
8144240	8147680	So there were some I didn't know, but there were quite a few.
8147680	8149080	I did. I was like, oh, April O'Neill.
8149080	8151000	I know her, you know, and that whole thing.
8151000	8152800	So 80s Ninja Turtles, too.
8153000	8153840	So, yeah, yeah.
8154040	8156080	It's what's the one people remember, Loki?
8156280	8157360	That's the thing.
8157560	8159960	If April O'Neill isn't wearing that bright
8160160	8162840	yellow pantsuit, then is it really April O'Neill?
8163040	8165400	It's not. It's not.
8165600	8168680	My favorite April O'Neill
8168880	8172280	is the one on the side of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles arcade cabinet.
8172480	8176280	Take a really good look at that fake ass fucking wig she's wearing.
8176480	8181040	Next time you next time you walk by a 90s Ninja Turtle arcade cabinet,
8181240	8185840	take a real good look at April O'Neill on there that she walked right out
8186040	8189400	of Party City's clearance aisle, OK?
8189600	8192960	And what a queen, Lord, what a queen.
8193120	8195520	All right. And and oh, my God.
8195720	8201840	Well, she kind of resembles the the movie April O'Neill, sort of.
8202040	8203920	Yeah, no, she she does.
8204120	8206680	But yeah, that that is not her hair.
8206880	8210000	DJ Romas says it may be a fake wig, but the model is hella cute.
8210200	8212200	I'm not shading her whatsoever.
8212400	8213800	She's iconic.
8214000	8215840	OK, that is actually a compliment.
8216040	8218040	But let's not kid ourselves.
8218080	8223080	She's iconic because she's wearing a ninety nine cent piece of vinyl very well.
8223280	8227480	OK, it's like and I don't mean that in a like weird stalker way.
8227480	8229200	I just mean she's a queen. All right.
8229400	8231120	Yeah. Moving on.
8231320	8232440	She wears it well.
8232640	8234280	Yes, she wears it well.
8234480	8236840	Boop, boop, boop. OK,
8237040	8237920	moving on.
8238120	8241440	Are people are are multiple people linking that in chat?
8241640	8243640	That must be what it is now.
8243840	8246160	I appreciate you chatters.
8246360	8247200	Moving on.
8247360	8250000	There was an update to World of Warcraft.
8250200	8251520	They've been kind of going back through
8251720	8256160	that game with a fine tooth comb and clearing out some of the oofs things.
8256160	8259160	You know, World of Warcraft is an old ass game at this point, right?
8259160	8261480	It's a it's like 15 years old at this point, right?
8261680	8264280	Yeah, you've done an expansion as the classic game of the week.
8264480	8267040	The game itself is over 15 years at this point.
8267240	8268560	So.
8268760	8272320	There are some things in there that don't read very well this day and age,
8272320	8275000	especially with the lens that Blizzard is under right now.
8275200	8278600	So there were some things that were removed.
8278800	8283600	So sometimes some characters that had a lot of dialog before.
8284680	8286760	Do not have as much dialog now.
8286960	8289200	Oh, this is the stuff you remember.
8289400	8293000	OK, you remember when you would click them and they would say things.
8293200	8297440	So like the Torrin male used to say, homogenized.
8297640	8300000	No way. I like the ladies.
8300200	8303080	Now, look, I'm gay.
8303280	8306720	I, I look at that and I just go.
8306920	8308520	I'm not offended by that joke.
8308720	8311480	I just think it's stupid, but OK, it is kind of stupid.
8311480	8312960	Yeah, that's why it's stupid.
8313160	8316760	But there's a lot of stupid stuff in video games, whatever.
8316960	8323480	But I also understand why now in the year 2021 with everything,
8323480	8326040	you know, that we're looking at, especially it's going on Blizzard.
8326040	8327600	I understand why they made an editorial
8327800	8331360	choice to say, you know what, I'm going to get that joke on out of there.
8331520	8332840	I don't know.
8333040	8335640	Maybe they should have taken the time to get a new line.
8335840	8337000	But maybe some of these same voice
8337000	8339160	actors aren't available or anything like that anymore.
8339360	8342960	I'm not I'm not sure anyway.
8343160	8344320	There's some other ones that are.
8344520	8347360	Yeah, like the orc female says, what's estrogen?
8347360	8349760	Can you eat it? That is no longer there either.
8349960	8352360	That one's a bit of a yike, a little bit.
8352560	8356920	The blood elf demon hunter used to say, are you sure you're not part demon?
8357120	8359160	I find myself wanting to stalk you.
8359360	8360280	That's an oof.
8360480	8363400	So there's there you definitely look at a lot of these things they removed.
8363600	8366240	And you go the mount writing the mount.
8366440	8367640	Yeah, yeah.
8367640	8371960	So there's a lot of these things that you look at and you go, oof, didn't age well.
8372160	8373720	So there it goes.
8373920	8375560	Now, of course, some of your,
8375760	8379240	you know, people that didn't even probably realize these jokes were there,
8379440	8383800	of course, are getting outraged over it because, you know, my my my censorship,
8383800	8385120	my video, you know what?
8385320	8387840	There's been a lot that's changed in World of Warcraft over the years.
8387840	8388880	In fact, so much has changed.
8388880	8389760	I don't play it anymore.
8389840	8391520	But it has nothing to do with the dialog.
8391720	8394840	It has to do with the other choices made in the game as to how it plays.
8395040	8396640	So
8396840	8399320	I appreciate that they are modernizing
8399520	8403600	the dialog like they are attempting to modernize everything else.
8403800	8406440	Speaking of choices,
8406640	8412120	let's also talk about a related story, also known as that time that Nintendo was
8412320	8418680	horny, specifically Nintendo of France, they decided to tweet an image
8418880	8425320	this last weekend of Metal Gear Solid Snake looking at Samus in the Zero
8425520	8429680	Mission suit, it's very clearly a screenshot that was taken in
8429880	8431040	Super Smash.
8431240	8432920	But the way it looks like it looks like
8433120	8438200	Metal Solid Snake is just straight up staring at Samus's ass.
8438400	8440360	And then they deleted the tweet.
8440560	8443240	I think they tweeted it with the eyes emoji.
8443440	8446320	I want to say what did they tweet it with?
8446520	8447160	Where was it?
8447160	8448680	I'm trying to look at the original tweet here.
8448680	8450680	My screen must be too. Yeah, that's what it was.
8450680	8451720	Just the eyes emoji.
8451920	8453120	That's all they tweeted.
8453320	8455600	You know, so that's what I do.
8455800	8459120	I you know, people are horny on Twitter all the time, right?
8459320	8463200	People, people, Loki, I know you've been Twitter is a thirsty spot.
8463400	8465520	I know you've been a victim of being
8465720	8468240	attacked by horny Twitter when you weren't ready for it.
8468240	8469560	Right.
8470400	8472200	So sometimes these tweets will get in your
8472400	8475360	timeline, it's up somebody's horny on main.
8475520	8480320	Once in a while, I might indulge or respond, so I'm sorry, but I will usually
8480520	8486000	respond with said eyes emoji, it's the perfect response to those sorts of tweets.
8486200	8487800	That's it.
8488920	8490560	But anyway.
8490760	8492400	We just need a trombone icon.
8492600	8496400	It was deleted, it was it was nuked into orbit.
8496600	8498080	I'm assuming
8498280	8500840	at the rest of Nintendo outside of France,
8501040	8503440	they probably had a hard time seeing the humor in that.
8503640	8504960	Anyway.
8505560	8508080	Let's see, DJ says it's always an intern,
8508080	8510640	probably that monkey says probably was an intern, probably.
8510840	8513480	I don't know if it was necessarily an intern, but it was just probably somebody
8513680	8517800	on social media that was like, this will go viral and didn't stop to think about.
8518000	8520360	Is that good, though?
8520560	8521600	Oof.
8521800	8523520	Should it go viral?
8523720	8524960	Should it go viral?
8525160	8526400	Excellent question.
8526600	8527080	All right.
8527080	8528920	I think we're up to the part of the show
8528920	8531960	that is the listener roundtable where we're going to invite your calls and so
8532000	8535120	forth, you can call in via our Discord server,
8535320	8537400	vognetwork.com Discord.
8537600	8540400	You guys, we already have a caller in Discord ready to go.
8540400	8541560	So what do you say we get to it?
8541560	8542960	Let's invite somebody else on the show here.
8542960	8544400	Sound good? Sure.
8544440	8545280	All right, let's do it.
8545480	8548080	And we're going to bring them in and say hello.
8548080	8549560	And hi, you're on Orange Lawns Radio.
8549760	8550680	Who's this?
8550880	8555000	It is he who requires more than 20 seconds to talk about things tonight.
8555000	8556600	Hey, Jason, how you doing, sir?
8556600	8558040	I'm trying to find the right screenshot there.
8558040	8559440	There we go. Hi, Jason.
8559440	8560440	How are you?
8560600	8563440	I am doing OK.
8563640	8564560	OK. All right.
8564560	8567200	Well, OK is better than crappy, so we'll take it.
8567400	8569840	Yeah, I hope things get even better for you tomorrow.
8570040	8571160	Exactly.
8571360	8574440	Well, it is a Monday, so there's no guarantees about that.
8574640	8576360	We'll do our best.
8576560	8578680	I want to talk about Facebook.
8578880	8581240	Actually, I don't want to, but I'm going to.
8581440	8582840	OK, can we not?
8583040	8585640	But OK, under that context, sure, go ahead.
8585840	8589320	Yeah, the whole social network thing,
8589320	8591440	the whole social network subject is really difficult.
8591640	8595160	And before I say anything else, I think the important thing for me to say
8595360	8600760	outright is I agree with all of the points that all of you make.
8600960	8603480	Like I am in favor of Facebook being broken up.
8603680	8607840	I am in favor of Facebook being less of the less of the, you know,
8608040	8611080	the the predominant town square than it is.
8611280	8615680	There's just kind of a there's kind of a way that Facebook is talked about.
8615880	8618400	I think it's something that's not ever
8618480	8624000	going to change, like some some business always has the ire of everyone.
8624000	8627120	It's the you know, it's the it's the it's the Goliath problem.
8627120	8628720	There's always going to be someone there.
8628920	8635400	And the arguments, the way that people talk about Facebook as if they are the
8635600	8640800	God, I can't I can't find the right word because catalyst is probably correct.
8641000	8646800	Instigator is possibly correct in this context, like like
8647000	8650640	there is always a social demon because the problem is not the service.
8650840	8651920	The problem is not the medium.
8652120	8654600	The problem is the people
8654800	8658040	to a majority extent, like it's not Facebook, Facebook.
8658240	8663920	Facebook did not get the the the the flat earthers together,
8664120	8667840	but it does provide a place for conversation for them and outreach
8668040	8670800	and marketing and viral blah, blah, blah.
8671000	8672960	They made it really easy.
8673160	8676440	Yeah, and that's not that's not necessarily a bad thing.
8676480	8682080	However, the one thing that is applicable that is problematic with Facebook is
8682280	8685960	basically everything they can't that came out of 60 Minutes is is
8686160	8690360	as far as I'm aware, is a complete outsider, completely true.
8690560	8692840	And this isn't even the first time we've heard these kinds of things.
8693040	8694840	So a quick summary.
8695040	8698200	60 Minutes was the whistleblower
8698400	8702000	whose name that the lady's name I've already forgotten because it's foreign
8702000	8703680	and just doesn't fit in my brain very well.
8703920	8708040	It's fine for foreign foreign sounding, of course.
8708240	8711040	She talked about how the civil ethics
8711240	8717480	and civil research group within Facebook came to the conclusion that Instagram
8717680	8722960	Instagram in particular was bad for especially teenage girls,
8723160	8726240	self-image, self-confidence, self-worth, et cetera.
8726440	8731080	I remember an article four or five years ago or somewhere
8731120	8735600	around there that talked about a group within Facebook
8736360	8738440	knowingly.
8738640	8742640	Enacted a social experiment.
8742840	8745320	On users
8745520	8749840	with no consultation, they be, you know, in the in the era of the algorithm,
8750040	8757440	they knowingly put they knowingly featured negative toned sounding posts
8757600	8760320	into the preference of the individual's feed
8760520	8763760	to see if it influenced the things that they then posted.
8763960	8769000	So I I've I've you know, I was not a Facebook fan.
8769200	8772120	I had my grievances for Facebook from the outset.
8772320	8777000	I, like most other people, use it because as the predominant social network,
8777200	8783160	I exactly as like Jamie said, I used it to keep in touch with people
8783360	8786760	that a couple of years ago, I think it was I think it was twenty eighteen
8786760	8789200	that I nuked all my social networking because like
8789400	8793240	the amount that it was worth anything was not worth it.
8793440	8796200	So I stepped out of Facebook entirely.
8796400	8797760	I even stepped out of.
8797960	8799880	I know you've got still got points to make, but I just want to say because
8799880	8803000	something I had a click aha moment when you're talking about the body image
8803000	8805960	things and some of the things that this targeted, you know, it's interesting.
8805960	8808440	I mean, I know he said it very tongue in cheek early in the show,
8808440	8811480	but when Loki was talking about why does he always see all these underwear ads
8811680	8816240	on Facebook, I mean, in a way, if you think about it, a lot of those ads
8816440	8820240	can I mean, we don't talk about male body positivity and all this stuff enough
8820440	8823720	in our society, but there definitely is something about you look at a lot
8823720	8826880	of those models and it's like, I'm never going to look like that.
8827080	8830280	So, you know, in a weird in a weird way,
8830480	8835920	even you and I, Loki, Dark Soccer, all of us as adults get
8836120	8838960	faced with a lot of that body positive images.
8838960	8840000	Oh, yeah. All of that.
8840000	8843480	They also like advertising a ton of shirts that are supposed to make you look
8843480	8846120	more slimmer and pants that make you look slimmer.
8846320	8848120	It's like, who do you call me fat?
8848120	8849600	There was a Facebook.
8849600	8851480	Jason, it was just an interesting aha moment.
8851480	8854440	I wanted to call out there that it's even though, yes,
8854920	8858280	when we talk about kids, we get even angrier because kids are innocent
8858280	8858840	and so forth.
8858840	8861680	But it is very interesting when you really stop and think about it.
8861680	8863880	Everybody's being targeted with that stuff. Everybody.
8863880	8866360	Yeah, because because the problem is social.
8866360	8869720	So there's this thing there's this thing that I've been saying at work
8869720	8873320	as I'm as I've developed a lot more of my a lot more of my kind of like
8873320	8874800	mentored leaning and whatnot.
8876600	8881960	Social technology does not fix social problems.
8882680	8886600	And when when I think about a lot of the prescriptive ways
8886600	8890000	that things can be done to of things that could be done to Facebook,
8890000	8894040	Allah breaking them up like at a high level, that's really important.
8894040	8898320	But like, how do you how do you prescribe functional
8898320	8904400	social behavior, both on the the enabler, the, you know, public space,
8904400	8911440	little p public space versus like put the put the details on the people?
8912840	8915520	It's the same problem with freedom of speech and so many other things
8915520	8918480	like social, social, social problems are evergreen.
8918480	8920680	Social problems are.
8921200	8925400	Will social problems will exist forever because they are people.
8925760	8926520	They'll be made worse.
8926520	8927480	They'll be made better.
8927520	8929200	Like, like everything's going to go around.
8929200	8932920	But it's just kind of like the, you know, it's the it's the it's it's
8932920	8936920	piling on the big dog situation that just kind of just kind of bums me out
8936920	8941040	every once in a while to hear from anybody, all of these opinions, you
8941040	8944760	know, not not not singling out the show whatsoever, because I late night
8944760	8948120	and anybody else that rails about Facebook on Facebook, which is their
8948120	8952400	prerogative to do, it's just a really difficult subject because social
8952400	8957320	interaction is imperfect and you don't need any any any catalyst for that.
8957480	8958080	Sure.
8958080	8959080	But the thing.
8959080	8960760	OK, so here's here's the thing.
8960760	8963840	When it's I'm looking at a comment in chat from Square Tangle that says,
8963840	8966520	bring back GeoCities, bring back LiveJournal, bring back Zonga.
8966520	8968920	Hell, yeah, because I was such a fan of LiveJournal.
8969200	8974200	I I wouldn't say I met Dark Soccer and Loki through LiveJournal or you, Jason.
8974200	8977120	But our friendships were all strengthened through LiveJournal.
8977120	8979600	We probably actually met on DDR Freak.
8979600	8980760	You know, it's still there.
8980760	8982000	Just highly Russian.
8982000	8984080	I did meet my husband on LiveJournal.
8984080	8984960	Those were the days.
8985000	8990480	However, LiveJournal wasn't so easy to get on and use, you know, you still
8990480	8993840	had to be a little bit of a nerd somewhat to be able to use LiveJournal.
8994840	8997280	LiveJournal never really cracked the mainstream like that.
8997280	9000400	LiveJournal never really had a functional mobile phone app.
9000800	9003960	Yes, I know there was a I said a functional mobile phone app.
9003960	9005280	So you all know what I mean.
9005280	9007680	Facebook hit that perfect storm.
9007680	9010360	And I think we've all been wondering, when's Facebook going to get replaced?
9010360	9011600	Because I lived through LiveJournal.
9011600	9013320	I lived through Zonga. I lived through Friendster.
9013320	9015800	I lived through Myspace, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, all of it.
9016000	9018800	But yet we wait for Facebook to go away and it never does because they
9018800	9022120	hit that perfect storm of coming out when all the mobile phone
9022120	9023440	stuff came out and all of that.
9024200	9025440	Here's LiveJournal.
9026000	9026280	Go ahead.
9026760	9029120	Uh, yeah, Facebook, Facebook hit that, that perfect storm.
9029960	9033360	I do agree with you that it's like, you know, yes, Facebook does reflect
9033400	9037560	a lot of society's problems, but where Facebook has a real problem
9037560	9039240	and Twitter has a real problem.
9039720	9045320	There are artificialities being injected into normal people
9045320	9050920	conversations that shouldn't be there, but they're artificially being pushed.
9051080	9054160	And we know that through the whole, you know, Cambridge Analytica stuff
9054160	9056800	that came up a couple of years ago out of Facebook through the advertising.
9057000	9058520	And now we know this too.
9058520	9061360	We know that Facebook is promoting content with the body
9061360	9062560	positivity and all this stuff.
9062560	9065640	Facebook thrives on this controversial content.
9066080	9070920	Our conversations face to face might get heated, might get animated.
9071320	9078520	They don't go to that place of straight up bullshit, unfounded bullshit, usually.
9078680	9082040	Now, and now, now when they do, we think, well, yeah, sure.
9082040	9084720	I have a lot of conversations with family members that are bullshit because
9084720	9087360	they're reading it on Facebook because you don't have to be a
9087360	9088920	real person to post on Facebook.
9090160	9090520	Nope.
9090960	9093800	It's become that easy to use.
9093840	9095400	And that's the problem.
9095680	9100280	Like I, I, it's, and I know I'm, I know I'm sounding like one of those crazy
9100280	9102520	conspiracy, I sound like the art bell show right now.
9102520	9103200	That's fine.
9103200	9104280	I'll, I'll accept that.
9104760	9109400	But the problem is foreign influencers have infiltrated Facebook.
9110000	9110800	Period.
9113080	9115040	And Facebook is not doing enough about it.
9116680	9121320	And they're stirring the pot with all of this stuff because they can.
9122400	9125520	I don't, I'm going to, I'm going to go there.
9125520	9126400	Whatever I live there.
9129280	9133360	You, you have a timeshare, all this vaccination misinformation and all
9133360	9135320	this bullshit that's going on on Facebook.
9135520	9140640	That is proactively encouraging people to not take the vaccine and die as a result.
9143200	9146840	That is the result of foreign influence and people wanting
9146840	9148560	to take down America a few pegs.
9149320	9151840	I can counterpoint you with that very easily.
9152200	9152560	Sure.
9153160	9155240	Jenny McCarthy a decade ago.
9156600	9161520	But even this isn't new, this isn't new vaccine misinformation and denial.
9161520	9162800	This isn't any bit new.
9162920	9163720	It's just lethal.
9163720	9168320	Now, even, even her was amplified by Facebook though.
9168360	9172440	Facebook's been around that long where I also associate a lot of here's the,
9172480	9174520	here's the thing, yes, you're right.
9174520	9177600	Jenny McCarthy and all that, you know, bullshit.
9177640	9179800	And, and that from that years ago.
9179800	9180600	Yes, absolutely.
9180600	9181280	I'm with you there.
9181280	9182240	That did exist.
9182600	9188360	But again, Facebook amplified it because, and you know, I bet there were many people
9188360	9192120	out there that had no idea who that woman was until Facebook started amplifying the
9192120	9194880	message and people started sharing that on the social media.
9195000	9198240	And we had those clickbait headlines that brought that stuff up to the forefront.
9198400	9203200	And I even want to say, I could be wrong, but I feel like I've seen before Jenny
9203200	9207800	McCarthy even saying, you know, I wish I wasn't the poster person for this anymore.
9208400	9212680	I, I've, you know, I, I, I, I think I'm getting taken out of context a lot and
9212680	9213120	stuff like this.
9213280	9218120	She said things like that, but it doesn't matter because the narrative's already been
9218120	9219080	written on social media.
9219280	9222560	Like, I think, I think that's kind of like where it is for me is that you're right.
9222600	9227760	Her perspective and her silly, and in, if I'll give you this too, like the flat earth
9227760	9231440	and all that stuff that the concept of flat earth that's been around a long time.
9231440	9232360	That doesn't hurt anybody.
9232400	9235280	That's, that's also kind of true.
9235320	9237760	The flat earth thing is just something we can all laugh at.
9238440	9242120	You say you can, you're believing that it's not going to make you like die.
9242160	9245840	You say it doesn't hurt anybody, but it killed rocket man.
9245880	9247360	So, uh, all right.
9247400	9247720	All right.
9247760	9248640	There's at least one.
9248680	9249000	All right.
9249040	9249360	I'll know.
9249400	9249920	I'll give you that.
9249920	9250240	I'll get it.
9250440	9255120	And I'm not suddenly saying like, but, but again, the Facebook and those types of
9255120	9258000	platforms have made it easier for those people to find each other because it's so
9258000	9258960	easy to get on Facebook.
9258960	9262160	In fact, Facebook actively recruits you at a young age.
9262840	9262960	Yeah.
9262960	9264680	It's not so easy to build a rocket ship.
9264680	9268800	So, you know, yeah, I am going to say that there is no forces
9268800	9270560	dangerous on earth as belief.
9272520	9272920	Anyway.
9272920	9275600	So, Jason, Jason, I do, I do think you make valid points.
9275600	9277240	I appreciate your perspective for sure.
9277680	9282280	I do think there is, I think there is a Venn diagram of what you're
9282280	9283160	saying and what I'm saying.
9283160	9284880	And there is a very, very large overlap.
9285840	9286200	Oh yeah.
9286240	9286440	Yeah.
9286480	9291000	Like we're, we're in, in the, in the, in the, what we want to see, uh, we are,
9291040	9294520	you know, 90% overlap and we just kind of like kick out at the edges.
9294520	9295520	And that's what we're talking about.
9295520	9296680	Cause that's what conversation is.
9296680	9300240	We don't, when, when two people are talking, they don't vehemently
9300240	9301280	agree with each other.
9301280	9303040	No, you're exactly correct.
9303040	9304600	And this is why you're correct.
9305080	9307920	So, you know, uh, it's social, social process.
9307920	9310280	It's just, it's a, it's yeah.
9310280	9312240	It's just a lot of, a lot of goings on.
9312240	9312560	Yeah.
9312560	9316600	I've had my, I had my fallout with a, uh, with the, with a anti-vax individual.
9316600	9321240	I've had my political fallouts in particular, uh, only, only increasing
9321240	9325520	as society, you know, as, as societal events happen and all that kind of stuff.
9325840	9330440	I, I, I wish things were discussed differently.
9330480	9332600	I couldn't tell you exactly how that is.
9332600	9336160	This is the simplification and conversation effect.
9336480	9341120	Um, we re we rail against the echo chamber, but there is a general
9341120	9345000	mentality mindset of this channel and we have our own echo chamber.
9345560	9348160	Uh, but yeah, it's all about scale.
9348160	9349640	Everything is different at the high scale.
9349680	9352920	Everything is different when every party is involved, uh, you
9352920	9354440	know, and, and nobody is happy.
9354840	9358120	I I'm, I'm not, I'm not saying anybody is wrong.
9358200	9360000	Uh, I'm saying events happen.
9360320	9364840	Uh, Facebook is right to be demonized to the extent that they have a hand in it.
9365240	9366720	That's very hard to prescribe.
9366720	9369760	And when you're, you know, when you're, when you're making a counterpoint, you
9369760	9374480	don't say, well, I'll say 20% of the good things I like about you and the 80% that
9374480	9376080	I disagree with, it doesn't, it doesn't work that way.
9376400	9379600	I get it just kind of wanted to, wanted to, like I said,
9379600	9381640	throw more than 15, 20 seconds out there.
9382000	9384440	Fifth dream in chat says, I love this response.
9384640	9385880	You're exactly right.
9385880	9387520	You son of a wonderful lady.
9390160	9393400	I hope your family is healthy for the knowledge that you imparted.
9393600	9395240	I hope you all have a great day.
9395960	9397360	Um, here's the thing here.
9397360	9398440	Here it is at the end of the day.
9399400	9399840	Go ahead.
9399880	9402520	That's just a very moonlighting thing to say.
9404000	9408640	Um, here's the thing I, and I, I'm not like, I don't criticize anyone for using
9408640	9411520	Facebook, I get, I'm on Facebook, I post on Facebook.
9413040	9416680	I, I would encourage everyone who's on social media to do this.
9417760	9421240	Stop letting social media manipulate you.
9421960	9426240	If you're about to get on a comment and type, fuck you, you fucking fuck.
9427320	9432720	Stop and ask yourself, am I being manipulated to have this reaction?
9433560	9436880	Is there something about this that is manipulating this conflict to happen?
9437520	9441160	Cause if you really stop and kind of choose those types of responses
9441160	9445160	appropriately, I think you might have an awakening as to what social media
9445160	9446600	is really trying to invoke out of you.
9447000	9449720	But you know what, if you're using Facebook to post pictures of the cat
9449720	9450880	and what you're having for lunch.
9451080	9451600	Cool.
9451720	9452480	I love that stuff.
9453640	9454920	Hide the post and move on.
9455400	9457600	Don't, don't, don't feed, don't feed the monster.
9457600	9458960	Don't feed the engagement machine.
9459720	9461720	Seek out what you do want and not what you don't.
9463920	9464280	All right.
9464480	9467720	Bobby Blackwell says, on the other hand, please let VOG influence you.
9469960	9474440	You know, I just post stuff about streaming and Dead by Daylight
9475000	9476760	and Transformers fan art.
9477040	9481120	And it's funny you say that because Mike Deff says, is Twitch the same though?
9481680	9483440	In some ways, yes.
9483480	9486920	I, and I, when I say any social media, I include Twitch in that.
9487160	9490160	Ask yourself, am I being manipulated right now to have a
9490160	9491480	particular reaction to something?
9491840	9496480	Because I can always, I can always choose to not respond.
9498680	9502960	Any service that puts something on you because we think you'll like it.
9504480	9506720	Not that, you know, not that decisions happen in the void.
9506760	9508000	It's all, it's all very complicated.
9508000	9511520	This is a, this is an incredibly complicated topic and never, never
9511520	9512840	solved because people are people.
9513400	9516840	And we will continue this process into a, into eternity.
9517080	9518960	And once we stop, somebody else takes it up.
9519000	9519880	Cause that's how it works.
9519960	9523360	Look forward to our future spinoff show, Orange Lounge Art Bellio.
9525640	9526120	All right.
9527280	9527800	Anyway.
9528240	9529520	Uh, thank you, Jason.
9529560	9532600	It was a lovely call and it's always good to hear from you and thanks for
9532600	9534520	everything, thanks for everything you do.
9534560	9537280	Um, the, those of you out there may not realize how much Jason
9537280	9538440	does for Orange Lounge Radio.
9538640	9539800	Yes, he does the voiceovers.
9540480	9545360	Jason just saved me two minutes a week in pre-production today with a very simple
9545360	9548240	thought of behind the scenes thing and how we transfer some of the
9548240	9549720	intro files and all that stuff.
9550040	9552640	Um, and it's one of those things where like, when you say it, it's
9552640	9556160	like, why didn't we think of this very obvious thing before?
9556160	9559440	And now it's like, Oh, and I just, I don't know if you saw the tweet I wrote,
9559440	9562880	but I was like, it just goes to show, you can be doing something for 19 years
9562880	9564280	and there's still ways to do it better.
9564720	9567400	Yeah, we've been doing, we've been doing this particular process for
9567400	9568640	what, two years and change now?
9568640	9571800	And I've now saved you an hour every year.
9572040	9575040	It, it's not to say it was bad or it was wrong.
9575040	9578120	It got the job done, but now, you know, those two minutes a week that you're
9578160	9580840	right, they'll add it that I will save an hour a year.
9580840	9583880	That is an hour that I can spend looking at pornography.
9583920	9584840	So thank you, Jason.
9584840	9585320	I thank you.
9586080	9588880	Also readily available on every corner of the internet.
9588920	9591080	Just seek out, seek, seek out what you want.
9591080	9592040	Not what people try to get.
9592040	9594240	That they don't advertise to me on Facebook.
9596160	9597880	All right, Jason, my friend, take care of everybody.
9597880	9598320	Have a good night.
9598320	9598600	Okay.
9598920	9600120	Orange land radio people.
9600120	9600960	You're wonderful.
9600960	9603080	And I thank you for listening because you're wonderful.
9603080	9603920	Son of a nice lady.
9603920	9604920	Thank you for being here.
9605320	9606600	How dare you be so cool.
9606960	9607280	All right.
9607760	9608480	Take care, buddy.
9611720	9612600	Love to hear from him.
9612600	9613280	We have another call.
9613280	9613920	Let's get to it.
9613920	9614880	We got calls tonight.
9614880	9615360	I love it.
9615360	9615560	Hi.
9615560	9616400	You're on orange launch radio.
9616400	9616880	Who's this?
9620240	9621400	Rama.
9622120	9623400	I can't hear anybody.
9623840	9624760	We can hear you.
9625920	9626240	Okay.
9626240	9626920	He's got his hand.
9626920	9629760	He's frustrated because he can't hear us, but we can hear him.
9630320	9634320	I just, he's got to go to his discord audio settings output.
9634320	9635640	What the heck is going on here?
9636640	9641320	We'll just, we're going to just listen to a moment while DJ Rama S has a inner monologue.
9642400	9644640	We could also play a joke and just not say anything.
9645520	9646800	I don't think it's still broken.
9647320	9647960	We could.
9648440	9653160	How do I explain due to the unfreezing process that I don't have an internal monologue.
9653240	9654560	Rama just said in chat.
9655240	9656280	Uh, damn it.
9656320	9657880	I'm sorry, y'all I'm out.
9657880	9659200	Uh, that's okay.
9659840	9666240	The depression is well, I hope whatever I DJ Rama S you nice person.
9667600	9669640	How dare you contribute to our program?
9671120	9671520	All right.
9672480	9673840	Hopefully it'll get fixed for next time.
9674040	9675200	Hey, let's check in.
9675200	9677920	So I think I heard you say earlier, uh, dark soccer.
9677920	9682960	There was no email, but all I can say is that, uh, there was no email, but all I can say is
9682960	9687800	that, uh, there was no email, but all I can say is that, uh, there was no email.
9688840	9689200	Okay.
9689600	9690840	Uh, yeah, I love that.
9690880	9692680	Uh, Jason with a good point there.
9692680	9695560	If you want his opinions, listen to anime jam session.
9695600	9696080	Very good.
9696080	9696720	Love that plug.
9697120	9697360	Love it.
9697360	9697600	Love it.
9697920	9700400	Um, let's talk about last minute stories.
9700400	9700680	Loki.
9700680	9702240	I don't know if you have anything you want to share with us tonight.
9702920	9703720	Yes.
9703800	9709880	The saga continues now, the saga being the Intellivision saga.
9710440	9713800	So now they got an email, they sent me an email today and I ignored it.
9713800	9714320	What happened?
9714880	9720440	So today they announced that, um, even though the system isn't out yet, they are going to be selling
9720440	9726240	the physical versions of the game, the games, or at least some of the games that you can purchase
9726240	9733200	now, uh, for limited time bundles, ranging from $80 to $150 with, I think it was like four or
9733200	9734640	eight copies of the games.
9734880	9738600	I don't know if you can purchase these individually, but if you buy all eight, it's 150
9738600	9738960	bucks.
9739360	9745680	And what you get in those physical versions is basically the, like a manual, like our little
9745680	9747160	card, that's a lenticular card.
9747200	9755880	You get a collector coin and also the game itself, which is an RFID, um, card.
9756280	9761280	But the thing that's unique about it and just it's buzzwords being thrown out, but apparently
9761280	9768000	the card itself is like, it's like an NFT almost where in the sense that you it's a digital copy
9768040	9768400	of the game.
9768400	9771320	Cause there's really no physical games you can plug into the console.
9771320	9775560	So when you scan it into your system, it basically ties that game to your system.
9775560	9783080	But because of blockchain, you're then also able to later sell that copy to somebody else, another
9783080	9789200	Amico owner, and then you can transfer that game using the blockchain and NFTs or something like
9789200	9789440	that.
9790560	9791240	Interesting.
9792240	9801280	It's a neat way around the, uh, the, um, the whole digital thing, but at the same time, you're
9801280	9803800	buying games for a console that's not out yet.
9804280	9807880	Well, I, and Bobby does make a good point and this, uh, actually escaped to me.
9807880	9810840	I did not realize today is 10, 10, 20, 21.
9811000	9815680	This is the third release date of the, uh, television Amico, but I'm not, I'm not going to
9815680	9818080	shade them for missing the release dates.
9818680	9822880	Like there are other things that, you know, have been discussed, but as far as the release dates go,
9822880	9828320	look, you still can't walk into a target and get a PlayStation five, you know, cars are hard, the
9828320	9829760	chip shortage and all that stuff.
9829760	9831480	It's real and it's affecting everything.
9831480	9833280	So I'm not going to shade in television on that point.
9833640	9837800	Um, they've had to delayed for several times now, so it is what it is.
9837800	9843080	So that was a little thing they put out on this, um, third release date target that they've had to
9843080	9846040	miss due to a fault that is legitimate.
9846160	9846880	I think.
9847880	9848200	Yeah.
9848680	9854280	Um, I'm still wary, like I'll wait for this whole console to be released and come out and see the
9854280	9856400	reviews and look at the games and stuff like that.
9856400	9864960	I mean, you know, just, I just don't, I just not, no, no fault to Tommy here, but like NFTs right now
9864960	9868440	are kind of a, it's just kind of a really shady gray area.
9868480	9874560	There's a lot of, the intent with NFTs is to be able to pay like artists for some of these digital
9874560	9882600	works, but there's a lot of people, celebrities and influencers exploiting this process to a really
9882760	9884120	obscene degree.
9884120	9887680	And so it's just kind of has a real negative connotation to it right now.
9888760	9892640	And just to throw this in here and I get it the whole, it's not really an NFT.
9892640	9897320	It's just more of like a way to be able to transfer ownership of a digital product, which is.
9897480	9898280	I like it is.
9898400	9899680	I like the way Bobby put it.
9899680	9904360	It's only an NFT if it's from the nifty region of France, otherwise it's a sparkling blockchain.
9904400	9905000	Yes.
9906040	9906920	It's, you know what though?
9906920	9908440	I, I, that's excellent.
9908840	9915120	I, this is one of the better uses I've heard of it compared to a lot of weird shit out there.
9915120	9919880	Like, did you hear the dark Sakura, not to keep shifting the conversation back to dead by daylight, but did you hear
9919880	9924160	the whole thing about why those voice lines from dead by daylight for pinhead got removed?
9924440	9929680	Because they wanted to do more stuff by like selling NFTs of that to enable it.
9930040	9932120	Yeah, it was really wild shit.
9932360	9936720	Like, and I hope, I hope that was somebody's fan fan stuff or whatever.
9937480	9942760	If, yeah, well, I was trying, I'm still trying to get my head wrapped around the MMR.
9942760	9943240	So whatever.
9945600	9945760	All right.
9945760	9946760	Anyway, sorry.
9946760	9948480	Uh, Loki, I don't know if you had a further point with that.
9949040	9950560	No, that's, that's about it.
9950560	9955040	So yeah, right now you can buy the physical versions of, uh, eight different games.
9955040	9957560	They have two paths of four or you can buy a pack of eight.
9958080	9958600	Um,
9958600	9960080	no, all right.
9960080	9965840	I'm not going to be, we're going to go back to the, to be fair though, the box art's really nice.
9965840	9967720	I do really like the boxes for them.
9968040	9969640	Just no, no.
9970040	9970480	All right.
9970480	9976400	We're going to try this again because, uh, we actually had a call screener help and get, uh, all this trouble sorted.
9976680	9979480	So let's try to welcome back to the program Rama.
9982360	9988320	There is one thing I have told people, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never,
9988320	9991200	never skimp out on your hardware.
9991560	9992880	And that's what I did.
9993160	9995040	I did not heed my own advice.
9996560	9996880	All right.
9996880	9998080	Well, what's on your mind tonight, buddy?
9998760	9998960	All right.
9998960	10004000	First, I just want to say your, your comment about Facebook and so forth for about engaging people.
10004040	10004840	I'll make this very quick.
10006360	10007960	That's part of the reason why I am in there.
10008040	10010320	I talked to my therapist about stuff like that.
10010320	10017920	Cause let's just say I just came off of another band because somebody made a comment about COVID and I
10017920	10023120	called them out and I got put in Facebook state penitentiary for repeat jail.
10023160	10025120	Yes, yes, I am.
10025360	10025840	Yes.
10025920	10029760	You frequent flyer stamp card for the Facebook jail, Rama.
10030840	10035360	I have like the, like the little awards, like the little medals that they have, you know, when you're in the
10035360	10039080	military, that, you know, but I, I do find it ridiculous.
10039120	10045200	You get sent to Facebook jail and then there's all this other, but I'm exhausted on that point.
10045200	10046560	So I'm just going to defer to you.
10047480	10048280	Exactly.
10048320	10048960	Thank you.
10049320	10051000	But I didn't call in about that.
10051080	10053360	I just want to talk about this whole Twitch thing real quick.
10053360	10057560	Cause you know, I just find this thing absolutely hilarious.
10057920	10063200	People losing their minds about these Twitch creators making so much money.
10063440	10067400	Why are you mad that Twitch creators are making a million dollars?
10067600	10069320	You made them rich.
10069440	10071440	You threw them their money.
10071560	10072920	You did all of this.
10073040	10074960	I just sat there and watch you do it.
10075120	10081200	But now you find out they're pulling a million five every month, somebody, and you want to be salty about that.
10081560	10083200	You want to, are you ready?
10085200	10086160	Hold on, hold on.
10086160	10088120	Cause item number two will shock you.
10088320	10088840	You ready?
10089440	10089640	Yeah.
10089640	10089880	Yeah.
10090120	10097160	That's not all of the money they're making either because there are sponsorship deals that many of them have and will do
10097160	10099520	sponsored content and will use certain equipment.
10100160	10101000	So guess what?
10101000	10103480	They're making more than that list that came out.
10104960	10106000	And it gets to like that.
10106000	10108720	You know, what's funny is the larger creator you become.
10108720	10114480	So the more money that you're making and really don't need any of the free handouts, the more free handouts you get.
10114840	10118280	So it's a nice problem to have, I guess.
10118360	10119360	And then guess what?
10119360	10124440	By, by putting out all this outrage about how you're so mad that so-and-so is making a lot of money.
10124600	10127560	You are continuing to put their name out there.
10127560	10132000	It's like that one YouTuber that constantly, and I don't care what his name is.
10132000	10138800	You all know him, that one YouTuber that's always constantly doing stupid shit that always shows up because he's doing stupid shit.
10139240	10145520	Honestly, I could probably be describing three different people, probably more, but anyway, go ahead, Ram.
10145520	10146000	I'm sorry.
10146680	10148680	Oh no, no, you're, you're absolutely right.
10149080	10152040	This is one reason why I don't follow like the top 1%.
10152120	10155200	I like the squad of people that I roll with.
10155240	10155640	Okay.
10156000	10161120	I hang out with Twitch streamers between one and a hundred.
10162520	10163600	I'm good with that.
10164080	10172840	But the main thing that had me rolling was the fans getting upset about how much money Critical Role was bringing in and get upset about that.
10172960	10173560	Hold up.
10173760	10182760	You have to understand at the beginning of the pandemic, a lot of voice actors could not go into the studio, so they weren't making any money.
10183320	10185000	They're on Twitch doing things.
10185160	10190200	Thank God for Steve Blue, who came up with a great idea for Critical Role, not Steve Blue, oh, Matt Mercer.
10190520	10191680	He came up with this great idea.
10192000	10195200	Voice acting friends putting it together and they're selling merch.
10195840	10205720	They got sponsorships and everything, but also this is paying for their livelihoods and it's also paying for the equipment that they're doing to make this show.
10205920	10206800	It's not cheap.
10207320	10208120	Exactly.
10208400	10216360	When I got my first quarterly dividend, you know, from, from Twitch streaming, I'll straight up say it.
10216720	10218960	It's about $120.
10218960	10219360	Okay.
10219760	10224720	That's paid for my web hosting, my domains and everything for a year.
10225360	10225960	And I'm good.
10226760	10236680	Even if I didn't get that much, I'm like, okay, I'm so used to paying for stuff out of pocket because I do this for the fun of it.
10236720	10237200	Okay.
10237200	10237760	Hear it again.
10238000	10239240	The fun of it.
10239560	10245320	Oh, mostly Twitch streamers are doing this for the fun of it and they're giving back and they're doing this and doing that.
10245480	10250840	The ones you got to look out for are the ones that are just in it for the money and don't give a damn about you.
10250920	10257840	So if you're going to get upset about this one Twitch streamer making 2.5, guess what, my friend, they don't give a damn about you.
10261720	10270520	Ladies and gentlemen, I'm leaving the show and just turning it over to Rama because that part that please go, please go back and watch the video on demand of this part of the show.
10270560	10271680	Just that's all I'm going to say to you Rama.
10272120	10277640	Um, like, yes, like it is Bobby, I know you're there.
10277720	10281360	Um, how much are the legal zoom fees for VOG network for a year?
10282520	10289960	Can you, can you let me know that because that is money that we're not paying out of pocket anymore.
10290200	10295760	I know some of you are very sad that we left shout cast, but I can't tell you how nice it is that we're not paying.
10296320	10300000	What was it was $120 every three months or something like that to run that thing.
10300000	10300320	I don't know.
10300320	10301080	It's been a while now.
10301560	10303440	Um, we don't have to pay that out of pocket anymore.
10303760	10309280	Um, and you guys are able to fund this through biddies and subs and all that, that when, okay, thank you.
10309280	10313680	Bobby says it is, uh, taxes and legal zoom comes to 600 to $700 a year.
10314240	10323120	The good news is your bitty and sub money means that Bobby Blackwolf, Rob Roberts and the rest of the company here at VOG network are not paying that out of pocket.
10323160	10323720	Thank you.
10324520	10331600	Thank you for legitimizing what we do so that when we want to do things like sponsor cons and, and, you know, do those types of, we can do that.
10332000	10339040	So, you know, no, I'm not making a million dollars or anything like that, but we're able to do this fun thing.
10340920	10344240	For free and it's cool to be, it's because of you guys.
10344240	10344760	Thank you.
10345040	10353000	Um, and, um, you know, there's some people on that list, like earlier in this, I don't think I necessarily want to dodge people just because they're popular.
10353120	10355200	I name checked Pokimane earlier.
10355360	10356120	I think she's great.
10356240	10359360	I think she's, you know, and she's got a lot of great perspective on things.
10359600	10365440	Now watch, I'm going to say that and somebody's going to find the cancelable statement, but as far as I know, she's, she's great.
10365440	10367400	And she's a positive influence on Twitch and all that stuff.
10367400	10377000	I'm happy for her, you know, and, and again, like if y'all are mad that these entertainers are making millions of dollars, wait until I tell you what actors and actresses make.
10377480	10398680	Uh, but in the big Hollywoods and there, but you know what, for every ScarJo, for every Chris Pratt, for every, for any of those A-listers, there are people working at theaters, um, improv troops, uh, community related stuff.
10399520	10405320	We've all heard the stories about waiting tables, trying out for reality shows and people that are for a reason.
10405440	10410400	People that are trying to push that dream that are just having a problem breaking through that barrier.
10410800	10421320	So now I think the only problem we need to address as a society and you're seeing it happen in Hollywood slowly, but it's happening.
10422360	10435200	And you're going to see it soon on Twitch is going to be about now, why doesn't the high paid actors and actresses reflect the actual population makeup of this country?
10436320	10448520	And that's now, I think the harsh reality a lot of us are looking at with Twitch is now here is the proof that at this time, only a certain group is widely successful on this platform.
10449920	10458920	So that is that, but that is a, an issue much larger than our little, you know, bottom 99% show we have here on Twitch.
10458920	10482920	Uh, She-Hulk 10 is suggesting O-L-R in a hot tub equals big money, do not tempt me because I want a hot tub to be in, uh, grandpa, grandpa, shut up, watch, uh, grandma, uh, grandpa Warcraft from Hoard House has a hot tub and has offered to do a hot tub stream.
10482920	10486320	So look out, you might get it.
10486720	10498720	Rob, I'm telling you this right now, if this is confirmed, I'm getting my best masks, I'm getting a round trip ticket, I will show up as James Brown or we can recreate that, that Saturday Night Live sti-
10498720	10500720	James Brown hot tub party.
10500720	10502720	Okay, we can do that.
10504720	10509720	I just want you and grandpa to hang out IRL cause I think the two of you would just keep me laughing all fucking night.
10509720	10510720	Like I wouldn't even have to drink.
10511120	10513120	I will be, I, oh, trust me, you will be drinking.
10513120	10518120	Um, I'm just, I just want a hot tub.
10518120	10519120	We can make it happen.
10519120	10520120	I love it.
10520120	10524120	I love how I'm volunteering, but I c I could call him live right now and I'd be like, hey, we're coming up there next weekend for a hot tub party.
10524120	10525120	He'd just be like, cool.
10525120	10530540	Don't care. I love how I'm volunteering, but I could call him live right now, and I'd be like hey
10530540	10533320	We're coming up there next weekend for a hot tub party. He'd just be like cool
