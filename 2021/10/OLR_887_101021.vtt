WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:14.860
This week, Facebook's outage made its managed games and apps, including Oculus, unplayable,

00:14.860 --> 00:18.680
Sony is ending the PS3 and Vita's digital marketplace again, and the accessible games

00:18.680 --> 00:22.880
database received wide coverage, hopefully cementing its place as a de facto guide.

00:22.880 --> 00:24.260
Why is that last one included?

00:24.260 --> 00:28.700
Because its need to exist is depressing to consider, but so beneficial that it does.

00:28.700 --> 00:31.860
These are just a few of the galvanizing stories of the week, now it's time for your hosts,

00:31.860 --> 00:34.980
Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to talk about them and the rest of the week's gaming

00:34.980 --> 00:37.860
news, starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:37.860 --> 00:46.740
Hello my friends out there on the internet, welcome back to another week of the show where

00:46.740 --> 00:48.140
every gamer has a voice.

00:48.140 --> 00:55.620
It is Orange Lounge Radio and we are live once again with episode number 887 of our

00:55.620 --> 00:59.420
show for tonight, October the 10th of 2021.

00:59.420 --> 01:03.780
My name is Rob Roberts and I'm here with you every week, along with my co-hosts.

01:03.780 --> 01:07.580
Say hello over there to Jamie Summers, DarkSakura, how are you?

01:07.580 --> 01:09.020
I'm wrapping up a pink drink.

01:09.020 --> 01:10.020
A pink drink?

01:10.020 --> 01:11.020
Oh, yum, yum.

01:11.020 --> 01:12.020
Those are, those are...

01:12.020 --> 01:13.020
I thought that was supposed to be...

01:13.020 --> 01:14.260
This is what's left of it.

01:14.260 --> 01:19.620
I thought those were supposed to be like a limited time thing and then it ended up sticking

01:19.620 --> 01:20.780
around for a long time.

01:20.780 --> 01:29.220
So it was an off, it was actually an off menu item, like a secret menu item.

01:29.220 --> 01:30.220
Got it.

01:30.220 --> 01:33.900
And it's been incorporated into the new reality of Starbucks.

01:33.900 --> 01:36.680
Well, I have coffee, but it's just boring old.

01:36.680 --> 01:40.380
I use my little machine to make the coffee, but I have backup soda.

01:40.380 --> 01:43.340
It's an important part of getting through tonight's show.

01:43.340 --> 01:44.900
Also with tech master, Loki.

01:44.900 --> 01:45.900
Hello.

01:45.900 --> 01:46.900
Hi, Loki.

01:46.900 --> 01:47.900
How are you?

01:47.900 --> 01:48.900
I'm doing all right.

01:48.900 --> 01:50.980
What are you playing behind you tonight?

01:50.980 --> 01:51.980
CarnEvil.

01:51.980 --> 01:52.980
CarnEvil.

01:52.980 --> 01:53.980
Okay.

01:53.980 --> 01:54.980
That was, I'm like, wait a minute.

01:54.980 --> 01:55.980
He switched.

01:55.980 --> 01:56.980
It was like Donkey Kong beforehand or something.

01:56.980 --> 01:57.980
He switched it.

01:57.980 --> 01:58.980
That was last week.

01:58.980 --> 01:59.980
I have the...

01:59.980 --> 02:00.980
Oh, okay.

02:00.980 --> 02:01.980
Oh yes.

02:01.980 --> 02:02.980
A little variety is good.

02:02.980 --> 02:03.980
Yes, it is.

02:03.980 --> 02:08.860
Hey, if the topic of food here on this program, which sometimes I would say we get criticized

02:08.860 --> 02:12.260
for talking about food too much on this program, but that actually doesn't happen.

02:12.260 --> 02:15.500
That's just me trying to keep things on topic sometimes I think.

02:15.620 --> 02:20.900
For those of you guys that are excited about a food talk, I have some good news.

02:20.900 --> 02:24.400
We do tape live every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern at the

02:24.400 --> 02:28.780
Voice of Geeks Network, live at Twitch TV, twitch.tv slash vog network.

02:28.780 --> 02:29.860
If you want to join along.

02:29.860 --> 02:35.220
We are usually after the Bobby Black Wolf show, but he is on hiatus for a little bit.

02:35.220 --> 02:36.220
Bobby is doing fine.

02:36.220 --> 02:37.940
I've talked to Bobby.

02:37.940 --> 02:39.860
Bobby's just not ready to be podcasting again.

02:39.860 --> 02:44.460
So stay tuned to our discord for all the details on when the Bobby Black Wolf show will return

02:44.500 --> 02:47.140
at five Pacific eight Eastern right before our show.

02:47.140 --> 02:51.660
Again, our discord is over at twitch, twitch.tv.

02:51.660 --> 02:57.420
How about twitch.tv slash vog network and then vog network.com slash discord.

02:57.420 --> 03:00.380
I do believe Bobby is out there in listener land tonight though.

03:00.380 --> 03:01.380
So hi Bobby.

03:01.380 --> 03:02.380
And I hope you're feeling well.

03:02.380 --> 03:09.200
And on the topic of food last week, I teased, maybe we need to do a bonus stream.

03:09.200 --> 03:10.200
That's just nothing.

03:10.200 --> 03:14.100
Maybe we need to make orange lounge foodie-o a reality.

03:14.100 --> 03:16.060
So I have good news, everybody.

03:16.060 --> 03:18.580
We're going to enable a channel point reward tonight.

03:18.580 --> 03:22.580
And if we can get 100,000 points, which we'll, we'll get those points because we, we did

03:22.580 --> 03:24.680
like 150 for the last one and we got it.

03:24.680 --> 03:29.180
So, but, uh, if you're willing to spend some points, uh, we're going to open it.

03:29.180 --> 03:30.660
Oh yes, Bobby just hit the button.

03:30.660 --> 03:31.880
There we go.

03:31.880 --> 03:36.980
A special orange lounge foodie-o presentation here at vog network where we will talk about

03:36.980 --> 03:38.880
nothing but food.

03:38.880 --> 03:43.340
So dark Sakura can talk about all the pink drinks or other Starbucks drinks she wants.

03:43.340 --> 03:47.180
Loki can talk about all the bacon infused things he's tried lately.

03:47.180 --> 03:49.940
And I will, I will talk about crazy flavored potato chips.

03:49.940 --> 03:51.340
You know, that's a thing for me.

03:51.340 --> 03:59.460
I just had, um, Alan found these at Costco, uh, and it looks really nasty on the cover,

03:59.460 --> 04:02.580
but it's Buffalo chicken flavored lays.

04:02.580 --> 04:05.860
So stay tuned to orange lounge foodie-o to hear more about that.

04:05.860 --> 04:08.620
I see some of you guys in chat donating already.

04:08.620 --> 04:10.580
Thank you guys very much for that.

04:10.580 --> 04:14.540
We're, we're already, wow, we're already over 10% of the way there.

04:14.540 --> 04:18.660
You guys are nuts, but in the best, what are the other special lays right now, Rob, just

04:18.660 --> 04:20.380
out of curiosity, I don't know.

04:20.380 --> 04:21.740
That was the only one that we saw.

04:21.740 --> 04:23.540
I didn't know they put out a new batch.

04:23.540 --> 04:29.820
Um, but it was, it had the label on it called like, um, pre pre get no tailgate favorites.

04:29.820 --> 04:33.860
So they're tying it in with, um, that just doesn't sound delicious.

04:33.860 --> 04:37.780
Not the super bowl, but like, I guess the playoff games and stuff, because baseball

04:37.780 --> 04:39.580
got big stuff, right?

04:39.580 --> 04:43.300
The like other chip flavored lays.

04:43.300 --> 04:45.860
So like Cheetos, Funyuns, and Doritos.

04:45.860 --> 04:46.860
That was the thing.

04:46.860 --> 04:48.020
I think that has already gone.

04:48.020 --> 04:51.660
I think that sometimes those promotions are sometimes blink and you miss it.

04:51.660 --> 04:54.460
And in my opinion, the only good one was the Funyuns.

04:54.460 --> 04:56.900
The others were really under, I thought the Cheetos one was terrible.

04:56.900 --> 05:01.620
Uh, but anyway, I didn't even know there were Funyun ones.

05:01.620 --> 05:04.480
There were, there were, they were wavy, but there, there were all right.

05:04.480 --> 05:07.740
More talk like this on, uh, see, see how easy food.

05:08.740 --> 05:12.820
But it's an important part of a video gaming is the snacks and all that good stuff that

05:12.820 --> 05:13.820
we have.

05:13.820 --> 05:18.220
Uh, so orange launch video coming soon, probably, probably after Halloween, I'd say early November

05:18.220 --> 05:23.100
is a good target time, assuming, I mean, if we raise 20 K points every night, we're going

05:23.100 --> 05:24.140
to be there in no time.

05:24.140 --> 05:27.500
So probably coming to you in early November, we'll set the date soon.

05:27.500 --> 05:29.700
Maybe we can do it on like 19 November or 20 November.

05:29.700 --> 05:32.340
I'll have to check on what days those are, but that would be a lot of fun if it works

05:32.340 --> 05:33.340
up with everybody.

05:33.340 --> 05:34.340
Yeah.

05:34.340 --> 05:35.340
That'd be a lot of fun.

05:35.340 --> 05:36.340
That'd be a special thing to do.

05:36.340 --> 05:37.340
So we'll try.

05:37.940 --> 05:38.940
All right.

05:39.940 --> 05:40.940
Do the thing.

05:40.940 --> 05:41.940
Do the thing.

05:41.940 --> 05:43.940
Uh, I haven't even contributed my own points yet, so I'll do that.

05:43.940 --> 05:45.940
Uh, let's get into some gaming news.

05:45.940 --> 05:47.260
There was a lot going on this week.

05:47.260 --> 05:49.500
We had a special Nintendo direct.

05:49.500 --> 05:50.500
We knew this was coming.

05:50.500 --> 05:54.140
That's the fun thing about doing this show weekly and live is that sometimes at the end

05:54.140 --> 05:59.440
of the show, we're like, Hey, seven days when we're back seven days, but when we're back

05:59.440 --> 06:03.720
here to do it all again in seven days, we're going to know some things that we didn't know

06:03.720 --> 06:05.860
on episode eight 86.

06:06.380 --> 06:12.540
And now we know the complete roster for super smash brothers, ultimate, the last character

06:12.540 --> 06:15.820
was revealed in a special direct, but the news really didn't end there.

06:15.820 --> 06:16.820
Right?

06:16.820 --> 06:17.820
Loki.

06:17.820 --> 06:18.820
We had a lot of stuff, right?

06:18.820 --> 06:19.820
Yes.

06:19.820 --> 06:24.780
So, uh, they announced that yes, the last character in this Nintendo series, absolutely

06:24.780 --> 06:28.480
not missing any Nintendo characters whatsoever.

06:28.480 --> 06:30.260
This is absolutely complete.

06:30.260 --> 06:31.620
Nobody's missing.

06:31.660 --> 06:36.860
But now we have Sora, um, from kingdom hearts in smash brothers.

06:36.860 --> 06:43.300
When he's not canon, that's not canon anymore.

06:43.300 --> 06:44.300
Interesting.

06:44.300 --> 06:48.100
How, so I think it'd actually be a really good character to have.

06:48.100 --> 06:52.820
I, Hey, look, I would have loved Waluigi as well, but like, I get it.

06:52.820 --> 06:57.220
And I I'm not, look, they should have done two characters, then we'd be only expecting

06:57.220 --> 06:58.220
one.

06:58.220 --> 07:00.460
Then this game would never end.

07:00.620 --> 07:01.620
It'd be over.

07:01.620 --> 07:02.620
No, this would be the last.

07:02.620 --> 07:04.660
They just do the last two characters instead.

07:04.660 --> 07:11.020
That way you like, you get everybody hyped up by like, Oh, it's Sora Waluigi Waluigi's

07:11.020 --> 07:12.020
there too.

07:12.020 --> 07:19.220
They have to save somebody for the sequel Sakurai will never sleep again.

07:19.220 --> 07:20.220
I'm just kidding.

07:20.220 --> 07:21.860
Like he sleeps anyway, let's soccer.

07:21.860 --> 07:23.580
I have a fucking vacation.

07:23.580 --> 07:25.180
Send him to Tahiti.

07:25.180 --> 07:27.840
He's deserved it anyway.

07:27.840 --> 07:32.600
So along with the announcement that Sora is going to be in smash brothers, you may be

07:32.600 --> 07:33.600
thinking, well, wait a second.

07:33.600 --> 07:37.440
Kingdom hearts isn't on the switch, but then you'd be wrong because it is now on the switch

07:37.440 --> 07:38.580
or it's going to be coming.

07:38.580 --> 07:39.580
But then you'd be wrong.

07:39.580 --> 07:45.880
Cause it's not really on a cartridge because you have to stream it because the switch can't

07:45.880 --> 07:47.600
run Kingdom hearts.

07:47.600 --> 07:53.080
And so, um, but yeah, you can pay to stream it.

07:53.080 --> 07:56.720
Which is, it's not the first time they've done like control is a cloud game.

07:56.760 --> 08:00.000
And I know in Japan, the cloud based switch gaming has been more popular.

08:00.000 --> 08:05.480
I think there is a bit of surprise out there in the community that Kingdom hearts one and

08:05.480 --> 08:13.520
two HD remix are part of this, that, um, those games ran on a PlayStation three.

08:13.520 --> 08:16.640
So you would think the switch would be capable of those first two games.

08:16.640 --> 08:21.880
Uh, it's just maybe a question of maybe square just didn't want to do it.

08:21.880 --> 08:24.960
Maybe they didn't think they'd sell enough of them to put out the cartridges or I don't

08:24.960 --> 08:25.960
know.

08:25.960 --> 08:29.120
So for whatever reason, uh, they're doing it as a combo cloud path.

08:29.120 --> 08:30.120
Yeah.

08:30.120 --> 08:31.120
It's cool.

08:31.120 --> 08:32.920
You know, Kingdom hearts, this isn't popular at all.

08:32.920 --> 08:35.880
So we're just not going to put out cartridges, but Kingdom hearts is so popular that we're

08:35.880 --> 08:37.880
going to include its character in smash brothers.

08:37.880 --> 08:43.240
Uh, but your contradiction, Bobby black Wolf is in chat to remind you over twitch.tv slash

08:43.240 --> 08:45.880
vog never see, even though he doesn't have a show, he's here to correct you.

08:45.880 --> 08:48.760
Loki, uh, Bobby reminds you that three D S had Kingdom hearts.

08:48.760 --> 08:51.080
It was literally called Kingdom hearts three D yes.

08:51.080 --> 08:52.080
Drop drop.

08:52.080 --> 08:53.080
This is not the switch.

08:53.080 --> 08:54.080
Sorry.

08:54.080 --> 08:57.080
It's, it's not the card.

08:57.080 --> 08:58.880
There was that card game on the Gameboy advance.

08:58.880 --> 09:03.540
I know the three D has had tons of things on it, but the three D S doesn't exist anymore.

09:03.540 --> 09:04.540
It's only the switch.

09:04.540 --> 09:11.960
And so therefore Kingdom hearts on a Nintendo console, not a console it's on a handheld.

09:11.960 --> 09:13.000
Yes.

09:13.000 --> 09:19.120
There's been several Kingdom hearts properties and things like that, but not on an actual

09:19.120 --> 09:20.120
console.

09:20.160 --> 09:25.840
I, it makes as much sense as having cloud and separate off in the lineup do, and it's

09:25.840 --> 09:26.840
fine.

09:26.840 --> 09:28.080
Like I really have no problem with it.

09:28.080 --> 09:32.920
I I'm honestly more surprised, honestly, that they got Sora for it, but at the same time,

09:32.920 --> 09:33.920
they were able to get cloud.

09:33.920 --> 09:34.920
They were able to get separate.

09:34.920 --> 09:38.960
I know we should have seen all this stuff, you know, cloud and separate off both from

09:38.960 --> 09:39.960
Kingdom hearts.

09:39.960 --> 09:46.200
So, I mean, obviously, you know what I mean, Loki, it's like the other big square franchise

09:46.200 --> 09:53.120
that probably, probably has a lot of Venn diagram overlap with Nintendo fans and square

09:53.120 --> 09:54.600
and Nintendo are both well aware.

09:54.600 --> 09:55.600
Agent 47.

09:55.600 --> 09:56.600
Yep.

09:56.600 --> 09:59.800
He would have been a, you know, the next character if they were doing more characters.

09:59.800 --> 10:02.160
I, I honestly think Sora is a fine addition.

10:02.160 --> 10:03.160
I don't know.

10:03.160 --> 10:06.000
I don't know why y'all are hot and bothered Loki it's, it's fine.

10:06.000 --> 10:07.000
It's fine.

10:07.000 --> 10:08.360
I don't care.

10:08.360 --> 10:10.240
I think it's interesting.

10:10.240 --> 10:14.760
You know, there's the Disney side of it too, you know, because Disney has a stake in this.

10:14.760 --> 10:19.800
So I think there's a lot of people that are very interested about the fact that you know,

10:19.800 --> 10:21.280
Disney's allowing this in there.

10:21.280 --> 10:24.860
And some people have noticed some subtle differences.

10:24.860 --> 10:29.520
For example, like the, the stage that they added that has that infamous stained glass

10:29.520 --> 10:32.520
window that's like in the intro to the Kingdom Hearts games.

10:32.520 --> 10:37.360
If you look really carefully, you'll notice Donald and Goofy are not there.

10:37.360 --> 10:41.400
It's they got replaced by more generic types of art, not characters, but like, I think

10:41.400 --> 10:44.200
like one is now a ship and one's a star, whatever.

10:44.200 --> 10:48.560
So Disney very carefully only licensed Sora.

10:48.560 --> 10:53.000
There was a very tongue in cheek sort of tweet that was going around that showed the Mickey

10:53.000 --> 10:58.940
head that's on the Keyblade saying something like this shot probably cost Nintendo more

10:58.940 --> 11:01.560
than actually licensing Sora.

11:01.560 --> 11:08.500
To that I would say that's not going to be true because when you license Sora's likeness,

11:08.500 --> 11:11.400
that Mickey head is part of the Keyblade.

11:11.400 --> 11:13.380
So they licensed that.

11:13.380 --> 11:18.540
And I, you know what, I'm sure a company like Disney had final cut approval on the trailer

11:18.540 --> 11:20.540
and everything in between.

11:20.540 --> 11:24.340
So it didn't, it didn't cost him as much as you think it did.

11:24.340 --> 11:29.260
Nintendo probably went to Disney and Square and said, Hey, you know, our top five selling

11:29.260 --> 11:31.820
game, Super Smash Brothers.

11:31.820 --> 11:36.620
We want to put one of your characters as a paid character in this game.

11:36.620 --> 11:41.460
You literally don't have to do anything, but let us use it in our already established critically

11:41.460 --> 11:42.820
popular game.

11:42.820 --> 11:47.440
And we project based on these projections of other characters, such as Cloud and Sephiroth,

11:47.440 --> 11:52.760
your company will make millions of dollars off this DLC for doing nothing.

11:52.760 --> 11:55.640
How does that sound?

11:55.640 --> 11:56.640
Deal done.

11:56.640 --> 12:00.060
If only they could make that same deal for Super Mario RPG, but I guess that's a whole

12:00.060 --> 12:03.580
other whole other issue.

12:03.580 --> 12:04.580
So there's that.

12:04.580 --> 12:05.580
Um, let's see.

12:05.580 --> 12:10.080
And then, uh, along with that, I was gonna say we also got some Mii Fighter costumes

12:10.080 --> 12:12.180
as well coming and wait, I'm sorry.

12:12.180 --> 12:13.180
I'm sorry.

12:13.180 --> 12:14.180
There's some really, I'm sorry.

12:14.180 --> 12:15.180
I have to read these chat comments that are on topic.

12:15.180 --> 12:16.180
Cause they're really good.

12:16.180 --> 12:17.180
Sorry.

12:17.180 --> 12:19.740
Uh, Bobby Black Wolf says one of those things that I was told a bit ago is that the Mickey

12:19.740 --> 12:22.820
mouse ears are not actually controlled by Disney.

12:22.820 --> 12:26.540
It's the only Disney iconography that they don't control.

12:26.540 --> 12:27.540
That's interesting.

12:27.540 --> 12:32.580
Uh, Jamie, you've been down that rabbit hole more than us is, have you heard that?

12:32.580 --> 12:33.580
Actually yes, I have.

12:33.580 --> 12:39.380
Um, cause I think that's why a lot of independent, um, artists are making like their own mouse

12:39.380 --> 12:41.740
ears, for example, that they can sell them.

12:41.740 --> 12:52.020
I think that the likeness of a mouse ears can't necessarily be trademarked only specific

12:52.020 --> 12:55.340
dimensions of it to use it in purpose as a logo.

12:55.340 --> 12:56.340
Interesting.

12:56.340 --> 12:57.340
Hmm.

12:57.340 --> 12:58.340
Yeah.

12:58.340 --> 13:01.260
I'll have to dig a little bit more into the legalities about it, but I do recall that

13:01.260 --> 13:03.100
having been something.

13:03.100 --> 13:04.100
Yeah.

13:04.100 --> 13:08.300
And, uh, Bobby went to yield Google and found that, uh, they do not own the copyright.

13:08.300 --> 13:12.180
I would have guessed it was tied to that whole, uh, Disney has been deathly afraid

13:12.180 --> 13:16.700
of Mickey going in the public domain for quite some time that they actually have these laws

13:16.700 --> 13:22.500
that they get passed in Congress that they call them Disney laws that basically is extending

13:22.500 --> 13:26.380
the timeframe that intellectual property is held by companies.

13:26.380 --> 13:30.020
And they're, they're, they're basically to prevent Mickey mouse from going public domain

13:30.020 --> 13:35.100
because when that happens, all the Mickey mouse porn will be available.

13:35.100 --> 13:41.460
So thank God that hasn't happened yet because there certainly isn't any Mickey mouse pornography

13:41.460 --> 13:42.700
in the internet.

13:42.700 --> 13:44.040
There's more to it as well.

13:44.040 --> 13:49.060
There's also in terms of generics, like, I don't know if, I mean, a lot, probably a good

13:49.060 --> 13:53.800
number of our listeners may not remember this, but back in the like early eighties, there

13:53.800 --> 13:58.300
used to be this ad going around with showed like a massive copier and said, don't call

13:58.300 --> 14:04.660
it Xeroxing or like, and you hear this more, more often

14:04.660 --> 14:10.300
in Europe, but like vacuuming called hoovering because of the Hoover vacuum.

14:10.300 --> 14:11.300
Yes.

14:11.300 --> 14:12.300
Yeah.

14:12.300 --> 14:18.180
You know, uh, when you put on your, uh, it doesn't matter what the brand it is, you know,

14:18.180 --> 14:21.460
also over there, if you put on your rain boots, you're putting on your wellies.

14:21.460 --> 14:26.500
Well, I think, I think Nintendo, Nintendo's had this problem too, is that everybody's

14:26.500 --> 14:30.460
like, I'm going to go play Nintendo even when it's a Sega Genesis, because people have a

14:30.460 --> 14:32.380
certain age don't know better sometimes.

14:32.380 --> 14:33.380
Right.

14:33.380 --> 14:34.380
Exactly.

14:34.380 --> 14:42.020
But I think that there's also that Mickey mouse in general.

14:42.020 --> 14:48.980
Has also sort of fallen a little bit into that semi generic, but more in terms of description,

14:48.980 --> 14:53.300
you know, like, like, Oh, it's just your Mickey mouse, you know, like talking about a mascot

14:53.300 --> 14:56.060
or a main character.

14:56.060 --> 14:57.060
That's I've heard that.

14:57.060 --> 14:58.060
Yeah.

14:58.060 --> 14:59.060
All right.

14:59.060 --> 15:00.060
Anyway, good, good chat.

15:00.060 --> 15:03.780
It also shed some light on that little tongue in cheek tweet.

15:03.780 --> 15:07.860
So don't believe, I mean, it was a funny tweet, like as, as far as like the humor value.

15:07.860 --> 15:08.860
Great.

15:08.860 --> 15:11.580
But at the same time, don't believe everything you read on social media.

15:11.580 --> 15:14.760
It's not always extremely well-researched right.

15:14.760 --> 15:15.760
I'm sure we knew that.

15:15.760 --> 15:16.760
Anyway.

15:16.760 --> 15:17.760
Uh, and Bobby, Bobby's adding.

15:17.760 --> 15:19.660
I remember when we all used to TiVo things.

15:19.660 --> 15:20.660
Yes.

15:20.660 --> 15:22.460
Even Netflix is a generic now.

15:22.460 --> 15:23.460
Pod culture.

15:23.460 --> 15:24.460
You think about it?

15:24.460 --> 15:25.460
It is.

15:25.460 --> 15:26.460
It kind of is right.

15:26.460 --> 15:29.140
Netflix and chill can still be Disney plus.

15:29.140 --> 15:32.420
In fact, that's Mike's right about Google it.

15:32.420 --> 15:33.420
Yeah.

15:33.420 --> 15:34.420
Yeah.

15:34.420 --> 15:37.780
Rest in peace Bing.

15:37.780 --> 15:38.780
You know what?

15:38.780 --> 15:39.780
I never used Bing.

15:39.780 --> 15:40.780
I hated it.

15:40.780 --> 15:42.860
I used to use one called hot bot.

15:42.860 --> 15:43.860
Hot bot.

15:43.860 --> 15:44.860
Okay.

15:44.860 --> 15:45.860
It's back now.

15:45.860 --> 15:49.780
However, I learned the hard way that if you make a typo, it pulls up porn.

15:49.780 --> 15:55.540
What about, uh, ask Jeeves was what was, what were some of the other Alta Vista Alta Vista.

15:55.540 --> 15:59.260
Oh, I got to put my brain was my jam in like the nineties.

15:59.260 --> 16:00.820
It was another one.

16:00.820 --> 16:01.820
What's that?

16:01.820 --> 16:02.820
Legos.

16:02.820 --> 16:03.820
Oh Yahoo.

16:03.820 --> 16:04.820
Oh yeah.

16:04.820 --> 16:07.860
Well before it was a, uh, I, uh, a place.

16:07.860 --> 16:10.860
I don't know what to call it.

16:10.860 --> 16:13.540
Yahoo is now like the trailer park of the internet.

16:13.540 --> 16:18.420
And I, no offense to, you know, but it's just, you know, it's, it's, it's a place that's

16:18.420 --> 16:19.420
there in the town.

16:19.420 --> 16:20.420
All right.

16:20.420 --> 16:25.100
Uh, anyway, Doug Doug Doug go by the way is a lot more modern I think.

16:25.100 --> 16:29.420
So I don't know that it can be thrown into the, the realm yet.

16:29.420 --> 16:30.420
Lycos.

16:30.420 --> 16:31.420
That was the one I was trying to think of.

16:31.420 --> 16:32.420
Anyway.

16:32.420 --> 16:33.420
All right.

16:33.420 --> 16:36.460
And I just used AOL back in the day cause I had a free account.

16:36.460 --> 16:39.100
So all of my stuff was AOL.

16:39.100 --> 16:40.100
Back in the day.

16:40.100 --> 16:41.100
Ooh.

16:41.100 --> 16:42.100
Okay.

16:42.100 --> 16:43.100
Sj 100 Matt with your next trivia night question.

16:43.100 --> 16:45.980
And then Loki, I swear we'll go back to you for the other news that was announced.

16:45.980 --> 16:51.260
Um, Sj 100 Matt says, what about the time that Disney traded a human being for one of

16:51.260 --> 16:52.620
their properties?

16:52.620 --> 16:59.460
They traded sportscaster contract, Al Michaels from ABC to NBC for the Oswald, the rabbit

16:59.460 --> 17:04.860
trademark Oswald was made when Walt worked for universal and Disney wanted it because

17:04.860 --> 17:07.360
it was the one property they didn't own.

17:07.360 --> 17:11.300
And hello, that ties back to gaming Epic Mickey too, where that was a, you know, Oswald was

17:11.300 --> 17:13.080
a huge plot device in that.

17:13.080 --> 17:15.760
So I'm fascinating.

17:15.760 --> 17:16.760
I didn't know.

17:16.760 --> 17:20.340
I, I mean like now that you mentioned that, like I probably did know that, but I forgot

17:20.340 --> 17:21.340
it.

17:21.340 --> 17:22.340
So yeah, that seems to track.

17:23.060 --> 17:24.060
Yeah, it tracks.

17:24.060 --> 17:25.060
Exactly.

17:25.060 --> 17:26.060
All right.

17:26.060 --> 17:30.740
Uh, Loki, now we can go back to, uh, the, uh, direct news.

17:30.740 --> 17:31.740
I guess.

17:31.740 --> 17:36.860
I mean, so we can talk about copyright if you want more, uh, me fighters that have been,

17:36.860 --> 17:40.260
uh, or DLC for me fighters that have been released as well.

17:40.260 --> 17:44.060
So they had a Splatoon inspired Octaline.

17:44.060 --> 17:48.780
And then of course the one that everybody's really excited about was the doom Slayer.

17:48.780 --> 17:51.300
So now he can finally get that match up.

17:51.300 --> 18:01.060
And um, they also had, uh, let's say, uh, Judd, which I guess is a referee kitten.

18:01.060 --> 18:02.060
I don't know.

18:02.060 --> 18:03.060
I don't play a splatoon.

18:03.060 --> 18:04.060
Oh, yeah.

18:04.060 --> 18:05.060
Oh yeah.

18:05.060 --> 18:09.700
At the end of every stage that, that fat little kitty that comes out and waves the flag saying

18:09.700 --> 18:13.940
who won is the little meter goes that it's that it's that thing.

18:13.940 --> 18:14.940
Yeah.

18:14.940 --> 18:15.940
Yeah.

18:16.100 --> 18:23.020
Those were the, uh, the things you can buy for 75 cents, 75 whole cents.

18:23.020 --> 18:28.020
You know what though, for the doom guy versus, uh, Isabelle matchup, it's worth it.

18:28.020 --> 18:33.060
And all the doom fans hoping that that would be the last character are having a sad because

18:33.060 --> 18:34.980
all you get is the me, but you know what?

18:34.980 --> 18:37.420
They threw a lot of stuff was actually on the console.

18:37.420 --> 18:40.740
So, you know, there's that they threw a lot of stuff into the me's though.

18:40.740 --> 18:42.740
I remember undertale was all in there too.

18:42.740 --> 18:43.740
And that was a big deal.

18:43.740 --> 18:47.220
I think of how many more characters we could have gotten if they didn't include fire emblem

18:47.220 --> 18:48.220
into that.

18:48.220 --> 18:50.940
It's like 80 characters right there.

18:50.940 --> 18:53.100
Some people kind of like fire emblem though.

18:53.100 --> 18:59.740
So you get one like everybody else you've had your one, maybe two, maybe two, maybe

18:59.740 --> 19:00.740
two.

19:00.740 --> 19:04.900
And you can get some like shadow fighters or something like that, where you have like

19:04.900 --> 19:09.340
80 different, you know, uh, they're the same character, but they look different, you know,

19:09.340 --> 19:13.380
type of thing, you know, that's what I'm surprised we didn't get more of.

19:13.380 --> 19:16.300
But then again, that's also kind of the me's in a way.

19:16.300 --> 19:24.580
So I'm, I think, look, as much as I liked, I'm not saying this in a way to be shady Smash

19:24.580 --> 19:25.580
Brothers.

19:25.580 --> 19:27.060
It's an iconic game.

19:27.060 --> 19:31.180
It is legendary status, especially in tournament and competitive scenes and all this stuff.

19:31.180 --> 19:35.860
All that being said, it's time for the life cycle of this game to come to a close.

19:35.860 --> 19:39.420
Like it's, it's been the headline for years and years now.

19:39.420 --> 19:40.420
It's time.

19:40.420 --> 19:43.340
It's time to let Sakurai take a nap.

19:43.340 --> 19:44.340
Go on a nice trip.

19:44.340 --> 19:46.600
There's more people working on it than just Sakurai.

19:46.600 --> 19:47.600
That's true.

19:47.600 --> 19:49.940
They can move on to another game.

19:49.940 --> 19:54.380
Like honestly, hello, I'd like a new Kid Icarus if they'd like to go back to that, but you

19:54.380 --> 19:55.380
know what?

19:55.380 --> 19:59.500
Sakurai's earned the right to do whatever period the fuck he wants, period.

19:59.500 --> 20:03.060
You're telling me that no one could come up with characters for Smash Brothers other than

20:03.060 --> 20:04.060
Sakurai?

20:04.060 --> 20:05.940
I mean, that seems a little ridiculous to me.

20:05.940 --> 20:08.020
But that team and that group.

20:08.620 --> 20:09.620
Okay.

20:09.620 --> 20:10.620
Yeah.

20:10.620 --> 20:11.620
They have a good team, but other people can do that.

20:11.620 --> 20:16.420
I mean, if it was easy to make a Smash Brothers game, Nickelodeon, Nicktoons, Smash might

20:16.420 --> 20:18.380
play a little better.

20:18.380 --> 20:21.380
It does play pretty well.

20:21.380 --> 20:23.500
All right.

20:23.500 --> 20:28.720
Anyway, um, SSG100Matt says, you say these things, Rob, but the Smash community still

20:28.720 --> 20:30.220
won't let Melee go.

20:30.220 --> 20:31.220
And that's okay.

20:31.220 --> 20:33.800
I won't let Final Fantasy 6 go.

20:33.800 --> 20:36.780
And I know they're doing these pixel remasters and I don't care.

20:36.780 --> 20:39.660
A good video game never has to go away.

20:39.660 --> 20:42.500
We need a 3D remaster of 6.

20:42.500 --> 20:43.500
That would be amazing.

20:43.500 --> 20:45.180
A la like 7.

20:45.180 --> 20:50.940
Even if the systems fade out and you don't get to buy the system anymore, that's why

20:50.940 --> 20:53.600
we have emulators and all that good stuff.

20:53.600 --> 20:54.600
Remember this point.

20:54.600 --> 20:57.020
It's going to be relevant again later in the show.

20:57.020 --> 21:02.580
Anyhow, for now, anything else out of that direct that you want to mention, Logi?

21:02.580 --> 21:03.580
Nope.

21:03.580 --> 21:04.580
That's it.

21:04.580 --> 21:05.580
Nope.

21:05.580 --> 21:06.580
All right.

21:06.580 --> 21:10.780
The Doom Slayer DLC, that Mii costume actually comes out on the 18th.

21:10.780 --> 21:14.180
So we've got a little bit of time still for that next week.

21:14.180 --> 21:15.460
All right.

21:15.460 --> 21:16.460
Okay.

21:16.460 --> 21:17.460
Let us move on.

21:17.460 --> 21:20.660
We're going to go to our gaming weeks and talk about the types of video games that we

21:20.660 --> 21:22.180
have been playing this week.

21:22.180 --> 21:27.220
Actually, Dark Soccer, before we get specifically into your gaming week, um, you've been very

21:27.220 --> 21:30.020
in and all about the Twitch culture lately.

21:30.020 --> 21:32.620
So there's a couple of things I wanted to ask you about.

21:33.260 --> 21:37.860
Number one, you're doing another big marathon tomorrow, but this is unlike the last one

21:37.860 --> 21:38.860
you did.

21:38.860 --> 21:40.480
This is a charity related thing, right?

21:40.480 --> 21:44.420
So I know you plugged it on last week's show, but since it is tomorrow night, give a, give

21:44.420 --> 21:47.340
a good old plug for what you're doing tomorrow.

21:47.340 --> 21:51.620
So, um, I am doing a 12 or more hour marathon.

21:51.620 --> 21:52.620
It depends.

21:52.620 --> 21:59.460
Um, my dear friend, Barbara, um, who is one of the people who practically raised me, I

21:59.540 --> 22:03.980
adult raised me, um, when I was in college, took really good care of me.

22:03.980 --> 22:09.780
Um, her and Maggie, um, has, uh, recently been diagnosed with cancer.

22:09.780 --> 22:16.700
Um, it sounds like it's aggressive, um, but, uh, she's already undergoing treatment and

22:16.700 --> 22:27.260
I wanted to, um, uh, try to help, uh, sponsor, uh, some of that, uh, treatment by, uh, promoting

22:27.260 --> 22:28.740
her go fund me.

22:28.740 --> 22:34.860
Um, so what I'm doing, and if you give me just a brief moment, let me get, uh, a link

22:34.860 --> 22:36.340
to that real quick.

22:36.340 --> 22:43.980
Um, because I am, uh, doing a marathon with, uh, goals.

22:43.980 --> 22:49.320
So my first, you know, the first one is like, if I raise a hundred bucks, then, you know,

22:49.320 --> 22:55.380
you get something, uh, you know, I'll, I'll do like, let people choose my killer or something

22:55.380 --> 22:57.180
in dead by daylight.

22:57.180 --> 23:01.620
Um, if, hold on, here's the, here's the link to my tweet.

23:01.620 --> 23:08.380
I put it in, uh, and the tweet is actually a, uh, um, what's the word pinned pin tweet

23:08.380 --> 23:10.860
on my profile, just a at dark Sakura.

23:10.860 --> 23:13.260
Um, but I'm going to be doing some rewards.

23:13.260 --> 23:17.720
I'm also going to be doing some giveaways, uh, for some of my merch, like the death hook

23:17.720 --> 23:19.700
for cutie stuff.

23:19.700 --> 23:26.340
Um, but my goal is to try to raise, I want to at least like, see if I can throw in a

23:26.340 --> 23:28.660
grand, you know, cancer treatment is not cheap.

23:28.660 --> 23:29.660
Sure.

23:29.660 --> 23:36.580
So, um, and I said that if we can hit 5,000, I will play survivor.

23:36.580 --> 23:39.140
That's a big goal, but I'm going to wish you well on that.

23:39.140 --> 23:40.140
I'll be there.

23:40.140 --> 23:41.140
I might lower it.

23:41.140 --> 23:42.140
Huh?

23:42.140 --> 23:43.140
I might lower it.

23:43.140 --> 23:44.140
All right.

23:44.140 --> 23:45.140
Well, shoot for the stars.

23:45.140 --> 23:46.140
Shoot for the stars.

23:46.140 --> 23:50.940
But I am going to end up after a few hours, even though I am making it a redeem.

23:50.940 --> 23:59.620
I am planning on doing a couple of kill your friends matches and I might do a survive with

23:59.620 --> 24:00.620
friends.

24:00.620 --> 24:04.100
Oh, fun as like a bonus or something, you know?

24:04.100 --> 24:10.580
So it's not really playing survivor, but it's playing survivor.

24:10.580 --> 24:11.580
Makes sense.

24:11.580 --> 24:12.580
Yeah, of course.

24:13.540 --> 24:18.420
On top of that, I'm planning on inviting a few other streamer friends to participate

24:18.420 --> 24:20.500
in some of these matches with me.

24:20.500 --> 24:28.260
I do have a semi confirmation from the piggy Ubu, who is like my pig goo best do.

24:28.260 --> 24:34.060
And I wanted to, you know, people have been really supportive and have helped me promote

24:34.060 --> 24:40.820
like, I actually made friends with the new streamer who put it right in his discord for

24:40.820 --> 24:41.820
me.

24:41.820 --> 24:42.820
Will Jinkies.

24:42.820 --> 24:43.820
Oh, nice.

24:43.820 --> 24:47.100
He's working his way toward affiliate right now.

24:47.100 --> 24:51.820
Really fun LGBTQ plus streamer.

24:51.820 --> 24:57.540
And I've also, you know, a couple of the friends I want to thank.

24:57.540 --> 25:02.980
Lapain Tay has said something just, you know, friends have been really supportive.

25:02.980 --> 25:08.220
But yeah, I am really looking forward to it.

25:08.220 --> 25:11.300
I will link the GoFundMe as well.

25:11.300 --> 25:19.780
And if you screenshot for me your donation and link it to me either via discord, a whisper

25:19.780 --> 25:28.140
in Twitch or on my private message on my Twitter, then you will, depending on the tier, be entered

25:28.140 --> 25:34.180
in for one of the item drawings, one of the giveaways, and your funds will count toward

25:34.180 --> 25:35.180
the goals.

25:35.180 --> 25:36.180
Awesome.

25:36.340 --> 25:37.340
Awesome.

25:37.340 --> 25:38.340
Well, good luck.

25:38.340 --> 25:42.300
I hope you are able to get a lot of money for a really good cause.

25:42.300 --> 25:43.300
Thank you.

25:43.300 --> 25:44.300
Yeah.

25:44.300 --> 25:50.260
I, Barbara is like one of those people in the world that like seriously means the universe

25:50.260 --> 25:56.380
to me like, and I, I, I just want to make things easier.

25:56.380 --> 25:58.780
And then another of their roommates may have had a stroke.

25:58.780 --> 26:00.840
I don't know yet.

26:00.840 --> 26:08.760
So they're in a really tough situation and desperately need, need the help.

26:08.760 --> 26:11.600
Before we get to your gaming week, you said, or did you already shout out who you wanted

26:11.600 --> 26:12.600
to shout out?

26:12.600 --> 26:15.720
I shouted out two people, but I'd like to give another couple of shout outs.

26:15.720 --> 26:16.720
Sure.

26:16.720 --> 26:21.880
So of course, Will Jinkies, new streamer, awesome person.

26:21.880 --> 26:28.280
The Pigu Uwu, who is my piggy bestu, my pigu bestu, I'm sorry.

26:28.280 --> 26:32.920
And these are all dead by daylight things for those that don't know what, because out

26:32.920 --> 26:37.000
of context could mean something very different, but this is a dead by daylight thing.

26:37.000 --> 26:41.560
Just to be clear, if you haven't figured that out about dark soccer by now, she's a fan.

26:41.560 --> 26:52.080
Um, uh, empire TV is another, uh, is, uh, um, uh, POC, uh, streamer, uh, really awesome.

26:52.080 --> 26:54.160
And in my home state.

26:54.160 --> 26:56.360
So I got to share the Alabama love.

26:56.360 --> 27:02.280
And then, um, a newer friends, so lingerie and it's spelled exactly like it sounds.

27:02.280 --> 27:08.800
So lingerie S O L A N G E R I E, who I made friends with.

27:08.800 --> 27:17.760
And I actually, um, put it up on my TikTok, uh, I met, I met them memeing in dead by daylight.

27:17.760 --> 27:23.320
It was during the pustule flowers and, uh, their, uh, party was all going around trying

27:23.320 --> 27:25.600
to get people to look at the flower with them.

27:25.840 --> 27:26.520
I see.

27:27.120 --> 27:32.280
And I realized what they were doing and I went in for boops first.

27:32.280 --> 27:33.800
I thought they wanted to do a boop match.

27:33.800 --> 27:37.520
And then I was like, Oh, the flower.

27:37.840 --> 27:40.680
And so I looking dead, look at the flowers.

27:41.400 --> 27:46.640
And so I, I poked at it as pig, and then we all like farmed and

27:46.640 --> 27:48.120
maimed and I made new friends.

27:49.320 --> 27:50.640
That game is wild sometimes.

27:50.960 --> 27:51.400
All right.

27:51.640 --> 27:53.720
Uh, let's get into, it's all about making friends.

27:53.760 --> 27:54.800
Let's get into your gaming week.

27:54.800 --> 27:57.400
And the other, is it been all dead by daylight or have you been

27:57.400 --> 27:58.200
playing some other stuff too?

27:59.440 --> 28:02.560
Um, I, of course it's been mostly dead by daylight.

28:02.600 --> 28:08.200
Um, I actually, uh, did a forego of my stream last night, just because I wanted

28:08.200 --> 28:10.400
to prep for Monday and I've been really tired.

28:11.160 --> 28:16.640
Um, I, I've been playing, um, Fantasian cause that's what I stream on Tuesdays

28:16.680 --> 28:19.600
and I need to grind, I'll put it that way.

28:19.880 --> 28:24.000
My ass got handed to me on my last boss battle, but that game is so pretty.

28:24.040 --> 28:25.320
I love it.

28:25.920 --> 28:29.120
And they've actually, uh, just done an update for Fantasian.

28:29.120 --> 28:33.840
So there's some new, uh, end game content and some, and they've added a new game

28:33.840 --> 28:42.560
plus so rad cause that game could freaking use it, um, I have, uh, I've got

28:42.560 --> 28:47.200
Final Fantasy 14 and I'm, uh, actually I put up a poll and only three people

28:47.200 --> 28:51.800
replied to it, so I might do another poll, but I'm thinking my Wednesday nights

28:51.840 --> 28:55.760
after work is just going to be doing a just chatting stream while playing

28:55.760 --> 28:59.880
Final Fantasy 14, so folks want to chat.

28:59.880 --> 29:02.880
I can't play new world, like every body fucking else in the world.

29:03.760 --> 29:06.160
So I'll play the MMO I can play.

29:07.320 --> 29:11.320
All right, let's go to Loki with your gaming week.

29:14.320 --> 29:14.840
You're muted.

29:14.880 --> 29:17.880
Loki, the joys of sorry.

29:18.120 --> 29:18.680
No, you're fine.

29:18.760 --> 29:19.120
No better.

29:19.760 --> 29:22.240
Um, so it pretty much the same as last week.

29:22.280 --> 29:26.640
It's been mostly Minecraft with a little bit of power wash simulator.

29:27.480 --> 29:32.680
So, um, I did end up picking up Metroid dread and the Nickelodeon, um, all star

29:32.680 --> 29:37.600
brawl game, uh, which I know my kid has been playing the Nickelodeon all star

29:37.600 --> 29:40.720
role, they're not going to touch Metro cause they they're afraid of that game.

29:41.200 --> 29:45.680
Um, eventually I will play it cause it looks really good.

29:45.720 --> 29:48.360
So, um, but you know, I had to get it.

29:50.120 --> 29:52.320
But yeah, I'm power washing sim.

29:52.320 --> 29:56.920
I think I, the last thing I did was the firehouse.

29:57.880 --> 29:59.680
Oh, I'm not even up to that yet.

29:59.680 --> 30:03.120
I'm as far, so I played that on stream.

30:03.200 --> 30:04.520
I know I missed it.

30:04.520 --> 30:05.680
I was like, oh man.

30:05.680 --> 30:09.680
Well, all of my streams are archived all over at my channel, but I know who wants

30:09.680 --> 30:12.840
to watch in the archive streams, you know, usually you're looking for a certain

30:12.840 --> 30:14.320
thing, but it was a, what we did.

30:14.320 --> 30:17.920
I washed one of the houses, but I feel like there's more than one house, so I

30:18.160 --> 30:19.920
don't know how to, how to better say it.

30:20.200 --> 30:25.120
So, um, but what I unlocked, no, it was two story, two story.

30:25.120 --> 30:25.440
Okay.

30:25.440 --> 30:25.640
Yeah.

30:26.360 --> 30:30.800
What I unlocked was a skate park and we went in there right at the end of the

30:30.800 --> 30:34.640
stream and it's like, there's just bullshit everywhere on that stage.

30:34.640 --> 30:36.400
I was like, this one's going to take a little while.

30:36.520 --> 30:39.000
Cause I did, I did the house start to finish on stream.

30:39.000 --> 30:40.080
I only did that.

30:40.080 --> 30:42.360
And the golf cart, the golf cart took me like 10 minutes.

30:42.440 --> 30:42.720
Yeah.

30:42.840 --> 30:45.320
The house like was like an hour and a half.

30:45.400 --> 30:46.760
Like it was an hour and a half until I was done.

30:47.080 --> 30:49.120
But it went by really, really fast.

30:49.520 --> 30:50.240
It was a fun stream.

30:51.320 --> 30:51.680
Yeah.

30:52.040 --> 30:52.440
Awesome.

30:53.320 --> 30:53.600
All right.

30:53.600 --> 30:54.560
Anything else for your gaming week?

30:55.680 --> 30:56.080
Nope.

30:56.080 --> 30:56.440
That was it.

30:56.440 --> 30:57.400
Just those two things.

30:58.040 --> 31:01.520
Um, for my gaming week, I have been trying to, you know, I say this a lot.

31:01.560 --> 31:04.440
I'm trying to stream more, but I think I found a good rhythm that works for me.

31:04.440 --> 31:06.680
And that is that period right after I'm off work.

31:06.960 --> 31:11.040
So, um, the best time to try to catch me live is going to be around

31:11.040 --> 31:14.000
like four 30 ish Pacific to around six.

31:14.000 --> 31:16.640
I usually end by then I don't go much longer than an hour and a half.

31:16.640 --> 31:20.000
Maybe two hours, just because I don't want to get into the evening stuff.

31:20.000 --> 31:23.320
Especially when my husband, Alan does a lot of streaming in the evenings.

31:23.320 --> 31:26.080
I'm like kind of all over the place.

31:26.080 --> 31:27.960
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday is depending on when he's around.

31:28.200 --> 31:30.320
So, um, yeah, so I found a good space.

31:30.320 --> 31:31.760
I actually did a bit of streaming.

31:31.760 --> 31:33.800
I did a one night of Final Fantasy.

31:33.960 --> 31:37.760
I did a night with the power wash simulator and I did a Metro dread on Friday.

31:37.760 --> 31:42.120
So yes, I picked up Metro dread and I went in, I went into Metro dread, really

31:42.120 --> 31:46.160
sight unseen, like you guys know, I kind of held back on some of the trailers and

31:46.200 --> 31:47.520
some of the description of the game.

31:47.520 --> 31:51.000
Like once the initial launch trailer was out, that's all I needed.

31:51.040 --> 31:52.960
New Metroid game coming sold.

31:53.000 --> 31:53.720
That's all I need.

31:53.760 --> 31:54.560
I don't need anything else.

31:54.920 --> 31:56.760
Um, so I played the game.

31:57.360 --> 32:00.920
I was not expecting that this Metroid is survival horror.

32:01.440 --> 32:05.160
And of course I had people in my chat, like Bobby Black Wolf, that are like,

32:05.200 --> 32:07.520
the name of the game is literally Metroid dread.

32:07.520 --> 32:08.520
What were you expecting?

32:08.520 --> 32:13.560
And I was like, I don't know, but I just, this is not super Metroid anymore.

32:13.560 --> 32:16.920
When did this become survival horror, where you go into a certain zone and

32:16.920 --> 32:18.760
now this big red dot is chasing you.

32:18.760 --> 32:21.000
And if they catch you, you are one-shotted.

32:21.400 --> 32:24.040
Like that's some pretty serious stuff.

32:24.160 --> 32:29.720
So I ended up screaming a lot more like the, you know, like when you go

32:29.720 --> 32:34.800
behind the door, like that whole type of thing was like, that should be the

32:34.800 --> 32:40.800
name of the game is Metroid because that would more accurately define the

32:40.800 --> 32:42.720
experience of playing the game.

32:43.120 --> 32:44.200
Um, yeah.

32:44.200 --> 32:47.040
Fifth Dream in chat says those fucking EMMI.

32:47.040 --> 32:47.480
Yes.

32:47.480 --> 32:48.160
Very that.

32:48.400 --> 32:50.720
SSG100Matt says, it's a very pretty game though.

32:50.720 --> 32:51.200
Yes.

32:51.440 --> 32:55.720
Um, some are asking for my thoughts on the game because I do love Metroid so much.

32:55.760 --> 32:59.760
I just, my, I'm only like 90 minutes in, so I'm, I'm saving more to

32:59.760 --> 33:01.800
stream maybe one more, uh, next week.

33:02.320 --> 33:08.680
But I don't, I wasn't expecting the survival horror thing where you go into

33:08.680 --> 33:10.240
certain areas and you're chased by the robot.

33:10.240 --> 33:11.600
I kind of wasn't expecting that.

33:11.760 --> 33:16.400
So it threw my mindset off because usually I approach Metroid games and

33:16.400 --> 33:20.280
Castlevania type games where I'm like, I'm going to explore every nook and

33:20.280 --> 33:25.200
cranny of this zone and scan every part of the wall and do this and do that.

33:25.400 --> 33:26.520
That's how I approach it.

33:26.520 --> 33:28.680
But I can't do that in Metroid Dread.

33:28.800 --> 33:33.320
Now, once you defeat the EMMI in an area, you can go back and you can be a little

33:33.320 --> 33:35.520
more, but it just kind of threw off my rhythm, I guess.

33:35.760 --> 33:37.360
So I just was a little surprised.

33:37.400 --> 33:40.120
So, uh, I think the jury is still out a little bit.

33:40.160 --> 33:44.920
I am going to give one pretty big criticism of the game that I, I just

33:44.920 --> 33:49.200
don't like it, and that is the fact that some of the, and it's interesting because

33:49.200 --> 33:52.760
I've seen the game dragged on Twitter a little bit for accessibility reasons

33:52.760 --> 33:56.320
because of this, I wasn't even really thinking of that, but wow.

33:56.320 --> 33:56.840
Yes.

33:56.880 --> 34:00.800
Um, and that is that some of the controls are too much.

34:01.160 --> 34:02.000
It's too much.

34:02.240 --> 34:06.360
And what I mean by that is that like, okay, you kill the boss, you get the

34:06.400 --> 34:13.680
cannon, now you have to like hold R and blast with Y and then hit this button to

34:13.680 --> 34:16.800
do it's like, you're hitting all these buttons in a weird rhythm that doesn't

34:16.800 --> 34:17.480
really make sense.

34:17.480 --> 34:21.000
And I, I just, uh, Jamie, I see you talking, but you're muted.

34:22.240 --> 34:22.760
What are you saying?

34:24.080 --> 34:26.240
I was going to say, how many fingers do they think you have?

34:26.600 --> 34:28.800
I, I, it just felt weird.

34:28.800 --> 34:33.800
It doesn't feel natural and it feels needlessly complicated for a game where

34:33.800 --> 34:37.920
I'm used to, Oh, you just hit select to toggle between missiles, super missile,

34:37.920 --> 34:38.400
whatever.

34:38.680 --> 34:41.960
Um, and so I, I don't love that.

34:42.080 --> 34:44.520
Um, I think it makes those robots.

34:44.960 --> 34:49.200
Artificially difficult to kill and I don't think it needs that.

34:49.640 --> 34:51.840
So that's, that's my kind of thing with that.

34:52.280 --> 34:57.360
Um, fifth dream says hold five buttons, turn the analog stick, hold X and fire.

34:57.360 --> 34:57.720
Yes.

34:57.720 --> 35:01.600
It's very that, and I'm not loving that controls on top of that.

35:01.640 --> 35:01.920
Yeah.

35:01.920 --> 35:02.360
Right.

35:02.640 --> 35:03.000
Yeah.

35:03.320 --> 35:09.280
So I just think that could be simplified and, you know, whereas I am easily able to

35:09.280 --> 35:12.240
move my hands and I have motor skills and all that stuff.

35:12.520 --> 35:15.200
Uh, not everybody is as fortunate.

35:15.200 --> 35:19.360
And so I just think even for that reason, Nintendo ought to look at how can this

35:19.360 --> 35:21.120
process maybe be a little easier?

35:21.320 --> 35:23.320
DJ Roma S says, how far into the game are you?

35:23.320 --> 35:24.600
Only about 90 minutes.

35:24.640 --> 35:28.640
I got, so the first Emmy is a gimme, like you hardly do anything, right?

35:28.640 --> 35:29.280
That one's a gimme.

35:29.280 --> 35:30.040
I got past that.

35:30.280 --> 35:33.600
We did that whole second area with the second Emmy and I killed that Emmy.

35:33.840 --> 35:37.880
I got up to seeing the third Emmy, the green one, and then that's where we

35:37.880 --> 35:38.640
stopped on the stream.

35:38.640 --> 35:40.520
And that was about 90 minutes, maybe a little more.

35:40.920 --> 35:45.480
So, uh, and that was a couple of boss fights with that as well and all that

35:45.480 --> 35:45.960
good stuff.

35:46.520 --> 35:48.280
Um, yeah.

35:48.280 --> 35:51.880
Tiger class says it's one of those things you see in games where there's something

35:51.880 --> 35:54.560
following you that is an instant kill if you try to combat it.

35:54.560 --> 35:56.040
And the only way is to get away from it.

35:56.040 --> 35:58.280
Yes, that is, that is what that mechanic is.

35:58.280 --> 36:02.560
And it's, uh, it was just a little bit jarring anyway, but I'm, I'm enjoying it

36:02.560 --> 36:04.040
and graphically it looks really good.

36:04.040 --> 36:06.800
And so since I said something negative, let me say something really positive

36:06.800 --> 36:07.520
because I do believe this.

36:07.880 --> 36:12.680
I love how the game transitions from like the 2D running scenes and like you blast

36:12.680 --> 36:16.280
the door and then all of a sudden, bam, cut scene, but it's seamless.

36:16.360 --> 36:18.080
Like there's no loading time.

36:18.080 --> 36:21.120
It's just like you run through the door and now it's, and now, and then after the

36:21.120 --> 36:25.040
cut scene, the camera just spins around and bam, you're back in the 2D mode.

36:25.040 --> 36:25.720
Seamless.

36:25.920 --> 36:29.400
Like, I think the way graphically, it does a lot of those tricks.

36:29.560 --> 36:30.440
Really cool.

36:30.680 --> 36:37.280
So it's, um, it's, it's neat that it's a 2D game, but it is not afraid to show off

36:37.280 --> 36:42.320
3D in the environment because they do a lot of like, uh, checks to prime.

36:42.560 --> 36:46.200
Like you're never playing Metroid prime, but in some of those cut scenes, you're

36:46.200 --> 36:49.160
seeing through Samus's helmet, like it's Metroid prime.

36:49.360 --> 36:52.120
And I think that's neat how they kind of incorporate that in there.

36:52.800 --> 36:55.080
Uh, Tiger class says, so it's more than one Emmy.

36:55.120 --> 36:56.560
It's not just one that follows you around.

36:56.760 --> 37:00.560
There are seven that is mentioned early on in the story in the first 10 minutes.

37:00.560 --> 37:01.600
So it's not really a spoiler.

37:01.600 --> 37:02.440
There are seven.

37:02.880 --> 37:06.960
Um, but, um, they all are very similar in what they do.

37:07.400 --> 37:08.920
Um, so there is that.

37:09.880 --> 37:12.360
Uh, Crystal wasn't very impressed with it though.

37:13.040 --> 37:13.680
Oh, interesting.

37:13.680 --> 37:15.120
Crystal was watching my stream.

37:15.200 --> 37:19.560
Did, did, did Crystal end up getting the game in the mail, I guess later that night?

37:20.280 --> 37:21.000
Um, hold on.

37:21.040 --> 37:22.720
It might be a different crystal we're thinking of.

37:22.760 --> 37:24.080
Oh, okay.

37:24.320 --> 37:27.320
I'm thinking of the crystal that used to live here that I gave my Xbox or sold my

37:27.320 --> 37:28.800
Xbox to that it's in the Bay area now.

37:29.680 --> 37:31.680
Um, that's actually how I was thinking of.

37:31.920 --> 37:32.320
Oh, okay.

37:32.360 --> 37:32.680
Yeah.

37:33.040 --> 37:35.640
So I'd have to find the comments on Twitter.

37:36.000 --> 37:36.360
Okay.

37:36.480 --> 37:37.360
I'd be curious.

37:37.960 --> 37:42.240
Um, yeah, I, I know it's, I know it's hitting with some mixed results and even

37:42.240 --> 37:44.800
I'm kind of like, I like it.

37:44.840 --> 37:51.720
I don't know if I love it because they really changed the formula and I, I don't.

37:52.280 --> 37:53.680
It just sits okay with me.

37:53.920 --> 37:55.000
That's where I'm at right now.

37:55.000 --> 37:58.600
But I want, I want to give the game more than 90 minutes before I say this

37:58.600 --> 38:00.400
definitive kind of thing on it.

38:00.480 --> 38:02.160
So, all right.

38:02.800 --> 38:05.320
Um, let's see other games.

38:06.240 --> 38:07.280
Yeah, I do.

38:07.280 --> 38:08.560
Oh, I almost thought I found it.

38:08.560 --> 38:09.160
Nevermind.

38:10.040 --> 38:12.160
Um, I'll, I'll find it later.

38:12.200 --> 38:12.760
Oh yeah, here we go.

38:12.760 --> 38:14.400
Was really hyped for Metroid Dread.

38:14.400 --> 38:15.120
Then I played it.

38:15.480 --> 38:18.800
If I wanted a game this cheap, I would just play a Souls game.

38:18.800 --> 38:20.040
Not having any fun at all.

38:20.040 --> 38:22.120
It's pretty, but it's not doing anything for me.

38:22.200 --> 38:22.560
Yep.

38:22.640 --> 38:25.440
So, and that's, that's, I can read right into that.

38:25.440 --> 38:29.520
It's the Emmy mechanic that people are not necessarily enjoying and it is a

38:29.520 --> 38:33.920
different mindset and that's my biggest, that can, that could also be a big win

38:33.920 --> 38:39.760
for some people that is really fun for some people, um, that are, especially if

38:39.760 --> 38:42.440
you are into those Souls types of games and stuff, that's going to be a big win

38:42.440 --> 38:45.520
for you, but, you know, I, I don't know if it is that way for everybody.

38:45.880 --> 38:48.600
Um, Tiger Claw on chat says, you know, speed runners will find

38:48.600 --> 38:49.960
ways to kill the Emmys faster.

38:49.960 --> 38:50.520
Oh, no doubt.

38:50.520 --> 38:52.920
Speed runners are already having a field day with Dread.

38:52.920 --> 38:56.440
I'm sure Metroid Dread absolutely will be it.

38:56.480 --> 38:59.920
Well, I shouldn't, it'll be in a future games done quick.

38:59.920 --> 39:03.240
I don't want to say the next one, maybe the one after that, but you absolutely

39:03.240 --> 39:07.720
will see Metroid Dread, uh, in a speed run and then not that distant future.

39:07.720 --> 39:09.360
And it'll be fascinating to watch.

39:09.400 --> 39:10.200
It will.

39:10.200 --> 39:14.080
I actually, yes, I'd be very fascinated to see what they do with the Emmys

39:14.080 --> 39:14.920
and that whole type of thing.

39:14.920 --> 39:16.240
I'm actually looking forward to that.

39:16.640 --> 39:17.680
Uh, Bobby points out.

39:17.680 --> 39:20.400
It can't be an awesome games done quick cause they close those submissions.

39:20.440 --> 39:20.960
Weeks ago.

39:20.960 --> 39:24.680
Well, that's why I didn't want to, I chose my words carefully there.

39:24.680 --> 39:26.240
Cause I was like, maybe the summer one.

39:26.640 --> 39:27.040
All right.

39:28.400 --> 39:29.720
Other games I played this week.

39:29.720 --> 39:31.280
One I'm going to say really fast.

39:31.320 --> 39:33.600
So I mentioned I was going to buy this game, but I was

39:33.600 --> 39:34.520
going to buy it a little late.

39:34.760 --> 39:37.360
So I finally did pick up Diablo two resurrected.

39:37.880 --> 39:39.360
Haven't played a lot of it.

39:39.720 --> 39:44.880
Um, but I love the feature where you can toggle between the old graphics and the

39:44.880 --> 39:48.640
new graphics by just hitting like the letter G you flip between the two graphics.

39:48.640 --> 39:53.240
Because when I go back to the old graphics and how often we do, we do this

39:53.240 --> 39:58.280
with retro games, sometimes I go back to the old graphics and I go, damn, it

39:58.280 --> 40:03.040
looked that blocky, I don't remember that, but you have to remember we weren't

40:03.040 --> 40:07.160
playing Diablo two on high definition televisions, essentially, or monitors.

40:07.640 --> 40:11.240
Back in, you know, the day when that game was first out, we were playing

40:11.240 --> 40:16.080
on those giant CRT monitors that actually, if you had a 15 inch monitor,

40:16.080 --> 40:17.680
you were lucky, you know what I mean?

40:18.000 --> 40:23.920
Uh, and yeah, so now, you know, on these big 24 inch, 27 inch HD TVs,

40:24.240 --> 40:26.560
um, it looks very blocky.

40:27.560 --> 40:30.520
Fifth dream in chat says toggling is the only way I can even

40:30.520 --> 40:32.240
tell they updated the graphics.

40:32.480 --> 40:34.400
It feels the same if you never switch.

40:34.560 --> 40:38.760
Yeah, the game still feels the same for better and for worse.

40:39.120 --> 40:42.440
So like I spent hours and hours and hours in Diablo three.

40:42.880 --> 40:47.600
And so I'm not used to this whole fucking like, and I knew this was

40:47.600 --> 40:50.080
a thing and I remember this was the thing, but I'm not used to like

40:50.080 --> 40:52.560
your inventory fills up in 10 seconds.

40:52.840 --> 40:56.280
And you better have like a thousand town portals to go back and sell things.

40:56.600 --> 41:00.480
They got rid of that in Diablo three.

41:00.720 --> 41:03.520
So, and Bobby does remind us games.

41:03.520 --> 41:07.480
Weren't as blocky on CRTs just because of the way CRTs work.

41:07.520 --> 41:08.480
Yes, very that.

41:08.640 --> 41:11.840
So it was, uh, it was very different, but anyway, that's not a read on it's

41:11.840 --> 41:14.520
just, it's one of those things I appreciate the graphics look for.

41:14.560 --> 41:18.360
I mean, it is Diablo two with better graphics.

41:18.840 --> 41:23.400
This is the game most people asked for when they said I want them to

41:23.400 --> 41:25.880
remake Diablo two, but don't fucking change it.

41:26.480 --> 41:27.360
Don't make a deal.

41:27.520 --> 41:28.000
Okay.

41:28.000 --> 41:31.400
You got your wish for better and for worse.

41:31.520 --> 41:32.040
Okay.

41:32.240 --> 41:33.000
That's all I'm saying.

41:34.080 --> 41:35.880
Uh, I think that's enough of my human week.

41:35.880 --> 41:39.720
I, I, you know, the usual stuff dead by daylight, I had the sweatiest

41:39.720 --> 41:43.560
survivors today I was playing against, but it's, it's because I'm getting

41:43.560 --> 41:47.360
better with Wraith, so I know I'm moving up into MMR and I play

41:47.360 --> 41:48.680
a sweaty fucking Wraith.

41:48.680 --> 41:49.120
Okay.

41:49.240 --> 41:50.920
No ed devour.

41:51.080 --> 41:52.240
It's all on the table.

41:52.240 --> 41:53.000
I don't give a fuck.

41:53.000 --> 41:53.880
Don't rely on that.

41:53.880 --> 41:54.920
No ed Rob.

41:54.960 --> 41:56.840
I, I couldn't today.

41:56.880 --> 42:00.960
Cause again, sometimes, you know, you just get some maps and the totems

42:01.000 --> 42:03.320
like spawn on the survivors ball sacks.

42:03.360 --> 42:05.360
Like it just spawns that fast.

42:05.400 --> 42:06.920
Like, and so what are you going to do?

42:06.920 --> 42:07.800
What we're talking about?

42:08.080 --> 42:08.880
It's okay.

42:09.760 --> 42:14.720
So in dead by daylight, killers have the ability to have perks that

42:14.720 --> 42:16.480
will spawn on what's called totems.

42:16.880 --> 42:18.800
Totems are in random places on the map.

42:19.120 --> 42:22.400
If the survivor spends five seconds or so cleansing a totem,

42:22.560 --> 42:23.920
they get rid of your ability.

42:24.360 --> 42:28.200
Some maps, such as the Hawkins laboratory, that's going away in

42:28.200 --> 42:30.760
November, have pretty good totem spawn points.

42:30.800 --> 42:32.640
They're hard to find the totems on those maps.

42:33.160 --> 42:37.960
Some maps like, uh, the pen asylum I was playing this match on, you

42:37.960 --> 42:41.960
have the potential to spawn a totem right next to a generator.

42:42.240 --> 42:44.960
So as the survivors are doing their thing, they're going to see it.

42:45.040 --> 42:49.560
So anyway, you know, please, I realized we'd go off the deep end with dead

42:49.560 --> 42:51.880
by daylight chat sometimes cause dark soccer and I play so much.

42:51.880 --> 42:53.640
I just didn't know what you meant by sweaty players.

42:53.640 --> 42:55.880
I was like, I have no idea what that's referencing.

42:56.320 --> 43:00.880
Um, sweaty players means two of them brought flashlights and the other one

43:00.880 --> 43:05.040
had a flash bang and they made it their job to make sure I could hook nobody.

43:05.800 --> 43:06.320
Oh, got it.

43:06.320 --> 43:08.320
To sweat is to put effort into something.

43:08.560 --> 43:08.960
Yeah.

43:09.000 --> 43:09.400
Got it.

43:09.440 --> 43:12.160
And if you're really sweating about it, you're really putting a lot of effort.

43:12.160 --> 43:14.240
If I'm asking questions about stuff, I'm old now.

43:15.360 --> 43:16.400
I don't like that.

43:16.400 --> 43:18.480
I'm older than you and I play this game.

43:18.520 --> 43:22.480
They weren't sweating to do the game mechanics of repair five

43:22.480 --> 43:23.640
generators and get out the door.

43:23.640 --> 43:27.520
They were sweating to make my life miserable as the killer.

43:27.720 --> 43:28.640
It was a bully match.

43:28.640 --> 43:29.120
So that's why I bring no ed.

43:29.320 --> 43:29.640
What?

43:30.480 --> 43:33.440
Well, they, they were being efficient.

43:33.960 --> 43:34.560
That's the thing.

43:34.560 --> 43:40.080
If you get a good Swift that knows what they're doing, they know how to use their

43:40.080 --> 43:45.280
teamwork and they're efficient and you have to sweat, but the really sweaty

43:45.280 --> 43:50.880
survivors are the ones who are trying to go the extra route to get the

43:50.880 --> 43:55.360
flashlights done, the killer, although I sometimes a lot of, it doesn't take

43:55.360 --> 43:56.720
much to make me sweat anymore.

43:56.720 --> 44:04.440
So just say, well, I, that's kind of why, and I'll, I'll end my part of

44:04.440 --> 44:08.200
the DVD stuff after this was kind of why, like, I super love playing pig

44:08.200 --> 44:12.080
and Freddy because I always bring whispers.

44:12.320 --> 44:15.680
So I have an idea where people are, especially for pig.

44:15.680 --> 44:19.600
Like my build right now is, uh, whispers, corrupt intervention.

44:19.600 --> 44:22.760
So a half of my generators start off unusable.

44:23.360 --> 44:24.680
I'm explaining for, for Loki.

44:25.280 --> 44:30.240
Um, the other one I use is, uh, hex ruin.

44:31.040 --> 44:35.200
Which means that when someone stops working on a generator, it starts regressing.

44:36.600 --> 44:41.880
And then I also though, we'll use pop goes the weasel because when they have

44:41.880 --> 44:48.640
killed my, uh, my hex ruin, when they find my totem, I at least can get the

44:48.640 --> 44:53.600
generators to start degrading a little bit differently with that one.

44:53.600 --> 44:55.840
And it's a perk, not a, not a totem.

44:56.680 --> 45:03.040
So all of those together, I mean, I have a good time with pig pretty much.

45:03.720 --> 45:07.760
You're, you're the pig that, um, when, uh, Tay goes into a match

45:07.760 --> 45:09.840
and goes, ah, just DC it's a pig.

45:11.160 --> 45:11.520
Yeah.

45:11.600 --> 45:13.520
People will DC against, against my pig.

45:13.960 --> 45:15.600
I take that as a badge of honor.

45:16.480 --> 45:21.720
I'm actually going to start, uh, running one of those tallies in, in my channel.

45:21.800 --> 45:23.560
But Loki DC is disconnect.

45:23.560 --> 45:28.080
And that means that somebody, somebody would rather take a five minute penalty

45:28.080 --> 45:30.880
and waiting for the next game, then finish the game that they signed up for.

45:31.400 --> 45:34.360
That's a decent, and I've done it.

45:34.480 --> 45:35.560
I've done it as a killer.

45:35.560 --> 45:36.960
I've done it as a survivor.

45:37.840 --> 45:40.200
Sometimes you're just like, I'm not, I'm not having it.

45:41.000 --> 45:42.920
Sometimes you will get asshole matches though.

45:42.960 --> 45:45.560
You will, you will like absolute bullies, but yeah.

45:45.600 --> 45:45.960
Okay.

45:46.080 --> 45:47.040
All right, let's move on.

45:47.080 --> 45:50.360
Well, a lot of this, of course, we've learned from watching various

45:50.360 --> 45:55.560
Twitch streams and doing things on Twitch and Twitch, once again, in the

45:55.560 --> 45:57.040
news this week, aren't they Loki?

45:57.640 --> 46:02.560
Yes, because Twitch got hacked and what did the hackers take?

46:02.800 --> 46:03.560
Yes.

46:04.880 --> 46:09.640
Um, so they went, they went in and they, they took all of Twitch, all

46:09.640 --> 46:11.400
of it, every single bit of it.

46:11.440 --> 46:16.200
And, um, so now they've got, for example, the source code of Twitch and

46:16.200 --> 46:19.760
all of the special, uh, tools that they have, the mobile desktop and video

46:19.760 --> 46:24.560
game clients, they now know that there is a unreleased steam competitor

46:24.560 --> 46:27.080
called, um, Oh gosh, I don't remember what it's called.

46:27.080 --> 46:27.560
Vapor.

46:27.680 --> 46:30.440
It's vapor, very aptly name.

46:31.280 --> 46:36.040
Um, basically just all of it.

46:36.160 --> 46:41.560
So that's concerning because yeah.

46:41.600 --> 46:47.160
Um, that's, they leaked everybody's earnings that, uh, we're

46:47.160 --> 46:48.560
making money on the platform.

46:49.320 --> 46:53.680
Um, well, I guess, I don't know.

46:53.680 --> 46:55.760
It's not necessarily like all of the earnings.

46:55.760 --> 46:58.040
It's just the revenue from subscriptions.

46:58.320 --> 47:01.040
And it's also only like the top thousand or something like that.

47:01.040 --> 47:04.800
Cause if you search for me or you search for VOG network, you're not

47:04.800 --> 47:07.520
going to find it because we don't make that much money on, we do.

47:07.520 --> 47:08.920
We search for me.

47:08.960 --> 47:10.920
You're gonna find, I make no money because I don't stream.

47:10.960 --> 47:14.600
In fact, you, you might be sad and give more money when you

47:14.600 --> 47:16.000
see that we're not making any.

47:16.000 --> 47:17.200
I'm just, I'm teasing Darcy.

47:17.240 --> 47:18.040
I'm not in it for the money.

47:18.120 --> 47:23.320
Well, there's also, um, uh, I think like everybody had their Twitch keys reset.

47:23.880 --> 47:24.480
Yes.

47:25.040 --> 47:27.960
And encouraged to change their passwords, which of course I did all of that.

47:28.000 --> 47:28.480
Yeah.

47:28.480 --> 47:29.600
I need to do that.

47:30.920 --> 47:32.440
Which is kind of funny.

47:32.440 --> 47:34.960
Here's a funny, uh, behind the scenes story.

47:35.120 --> 47:38.600
So they didn't like, so they reset the, the stream keys, right?

47:38.600 --> 47:43.240
So, um, Bobby, uh, was like, oh, cause we all use separate, uh, stream

47:43.240 --> 47:45.640
keys to do this VOG network thing.

47:45.640 --> 47:48.200
I have my own stream key, but cause you can do that.

47:48.200 --> 47:50.240
You can issue out basically like partner keys.

47:50.240 --> 47:52.960
That's how a lot of corporate brands allow people to stream to

47:52.960 --> 47:54.160
their channels, different people.

47:54.160 --> 47:54.640
Right.

47:54.800 --> 47:58.240
So, you know, um, so VOG does this, so I have my own key.

47:58.400 --> 48:01.960
So, um, Bobby went in this week and reset it.

48:01.960 --> 48:05.120
He's like, okay, since they're resetting all the stream keys, here's this.

48:05.360 --> 48:05.960
Have fun.

48:06.280 --> 48:09.440
The day after he does it, we get another email.

48:09.440 --> 48:11.520
So they reset everybody's stream keys.

48:11.840 --> 48:12.680
Stream keys.

48:12.680 --> 48:16.560
And then two days later they realized, oh, we have to reset

48:16.840 --> 48:19.760
the, um, delegated stream keys too.

48:19.880 --> 48:21.560
So they reset it again.

48:21.920 --> 48:26.360
And Bobby had to send me another key and that wasn't a waste of time or anything,

48:26.440 --> 48:29.600
but just remember now how to find my stream keys, how to go do that.

48:29.800 --> 48:30.040
Yeah.

48:30.040 --> 48:30.600
Google it.

48:30.880 --> 48:31.160
Yeah.

48:31.360 --> 48:31.560
Yeah.

48:31.560 --> 48:32.800
How to find your stream key.

48:33.080 --> 48:33.640
Yeah.

48:33.640 --> 48:35.000
It's in your profile information.

48:35.040 --> 48:36.080
Yeah, I know.

48:36.120 --> 48:38.400
It's just, you know, it's a mess.

48:38.440 --> 48:40.040
How did I sound like such a boomer today?

48:40.040 --> 48:40.720
I swear to God.

48:41.440 --> 48:42.880
Um, okay.

48:44.160 --> 48:48.400
So outside of that, you know, obviously they, they confirm that yes, they'd been

48:48.400 --> 48:52.800
hacked and, um, they said that full credit card numbers are not still restored by

48:52.800 --> 48:57.000
Twitch, so, uh, those weren't necessarily exposed, but, you know, change of

48:57.000 --> 48:58.120
passwords, all that fun stuff.

48:58.280 --> 49:03.320
Plus they also got access to the, uh, switch or the Twitch SOC internal red

49:03.320 --> 49:08.080
teaming tools, which are, you know, different things that they use for.

49:08.080 --> 49:11.280
Um, I was like developer stuff.

49:11.320 --> 49:16.520
Um, so yeah, so like, you know, how we have this whole body problem.

49:16.560 --> 49:18.080
Well, I think it's going to get worse.

49:19.080 --> 49:20.160
So that that's good.

49:20.520 --> 49:25.360
Um, and then on top of that, just to scare you a little bit more that,

49:25.360 --> 49:27.400
Hey, it may not be over yet.

49:27.520 --> 49:32.120
Um, they've been taking Jeff Bezos picture, a really horrible picture

49:32.120 --> 49:36.720
of him and kind of pacing the background of different game categories.

49:37.080 --> 49:40.960
So if you look at some of the different games, you may have seen Jeff Bezos

49:40.960 --> 49:46.960
face kind of, uh, slowly peeking out as if some Halloween specter looking

49:47.480 --> 49:49.960
behind the game, like Michael Myers, right?

49:50.000 --> 49:52.240
That's freaking frightening that kind of thing.

49:52.280 --> 49:58.800
So, uh, that's, that's reassuring that that's still happening now after it's

49:58.800 --> 50:02.400
been hacked that, you know, somehow they're able to do that.

50:02.400 --> 50:03.760
So do they still have access?

50:03.760 --> 50:04.640
What's going on?

50:04.680 --> 50:05.920
Like, do we even know?

50:06.720 --> 50:07.200
I don't know.

50:07.200 --> 50:11.520
So I guess we're at the wait and find out what happens from all of

50:11.520 --> 50:14.400
this, because that's not great.

50:14.760 --> 50:15.960
It's not a great place to be in.

50:16.000 --> 50:17.280
No, it is not great.

50:17.360 --> 50:22.240
Um, and there's supposedly like, there's like a part two that's coming

50:22.240 --> 50:23.800
at some point or something, right?

50:23.840 --> 50:24.280
Yes.

50:24.280 --> 50:24.600
Yes.

50:24.600 --> 50:26.760
Because there's 125 gigabytes for the dump.

50:26.800 --> 50:28.480
They, they call it part one.

50:28.760 --> 50:31.840
So it's, there may be more coming.

50:31.840 --> 50:32.320
Who knows?

50:32.320 --> 50:36.160
The part I'm trying to wrap my head around is that the impression I was

50:36.160 --> 50:40.160
getting from some of what they were releasing, I felt like they were trying

50:40.160 --> 50:44.640
to come off as like an ethical hacker, which is a hard thing to do when

50:44.640 --> 50:46.160
you're posting things to 4chan.

50:46.240 --> 50:47.640
Um, sorry, not sorry.

50:47.640 --> 50:47.960
Right.

50:48.800 --> 50:53.640
Also like, you know, you are divulging people's incomes, which I guess if

50:53.640 --> 50:57.720
you're trying to take the Robin hood, you know, F the top percent or whatever,

50:57.960 --> 51:01.560
then I guess I can let that slide a little bit, but it's, it's supposed

51:01.560 --> 51:03.120
to be an ethical hack or no.

51:03.800 --> 51:06.600
Like, I, I don't understand what the point of calling people's incomes

51:06.600 --> 51:10.800
at, cause like, yeah, people, they, you know, they work for that kind of stuff.

51:10.800 --> 51:14.240
You have like folks like Hassan or whatever that like stream, like seven

51:14.240 --> 51:18.120
days a week, I mean, you have lots of people and they stream for like 10

51:18.120 --> 51:22.360
hours a day, like, dude, that's more hours in it for their work that they're

51:22.360 --> 51:24.000
putting in than I'm putting in for my work.

51:24.000 --> 51:28.000
Like, yeah, I think that they deserve the money that they get.

51:28.040 --> 51:32.640
It's listen, we're not holding guns to people's heads to force them to

51:32.680 --> 51:35.680
subscribe to these people, people subscribe because they want to support them.

51:35.680 --> 51:38.440
So like, I don't see where the downside is there.

51:39.640 --> 51:40.520
No, but that's seriously.

51:40.520 --> 51:42.560
The thing is it is their job.

51:42.600 --> 51:44.800
It is what they do for a living.

51:44.840 --> 51:50.880
It is not always fun, you know, but it's what they do for a living.

51:50.880 --> 51:56.520
It'd be like someone went to my job, published my job and my salary, which

51:56.600 --> 51:59.640
I mean, I kind of don't care, but personally, I mean, I care if people

51:59.640 --> 52:01.800
know where I work, but you know what I mean, going back to my point.

52:02.840 --> 52:08.200
It's not, it's, there's nothing ethical about it.

52:08.560 --> 52:10.800
They did it for E-peen.

52:11.080 --> 52:15.240
There was a very interesting response by Pokimane, one of the streamers

52:15.240 --> 52:16.800
that's on that top, top 100.

52:16.920 --> 52:18.440
She does very well for herself, obviously.

52:18.440 --> 52:21.360
And she, she was, uh, very, uh, very much in the limelight recently.

52:21.360 --> 52:26.280
Cause she, she helped AOC, the Congresswoman do her stream when she was doing

52:26.280 --> 52:30.360
Among Us, um, during the last election cycle, um, Pokimane had a very interesting

52:30.360 --> 52:31.240
response to the whole thing.

52:31.280 --> 52:35.600
She kind of said, well, now, you know why I limit the amount that people can donate.

52:36.320 --> 52:39.000
Um, and I thought that was an interesting take on it is she was kind of like, I

52:39.000 --> 52:39.600
got the impression of that.

52:39.600 --> 52:41.440
She's like, I know I make a lot of money doing this.

52:41.600 --> 52:42.560
I don't need to make more.

52:42.880 --> 52:46.680
Cause she, she also was, she addressed like a sponsorships and things of that

52:46.680 --> 52:51.320
nature that aren't captured by that list, which, um, I just thought it was interesting.

52:51.680 --> 52:55.160
Uh, speaking of interesting, this comment in our chat over at twitch.tv slash

52:55.160 --> 52:59.920
vlog network, um, some, a couple of people wondering, could this have been an inside

52:59.920 --> 53:05.240
job, uh, DJ Rama S says, I think it was an inside job, third party, critical myth

53:05.240 --> 53:07.360
says, definitely seems like an inside job to me.

53:07.400 --> 53:07.840
What were you saying?

53:07.840 --> 53:08.120
Loki?

53:08.720 --> 53:12.840
I was going to say Twitch said it was a third party that did it so far.

53:12.840 --> 53:15.200
They haven't figured out that it's a internal.

53:15.440 --> 53:19.120
See sometimes though, Loki, it's all in the words because technically, and I don't

53:19.120 --> 53:21.360
mean to, you know, get my tinfoil party.

53:21.480 --> 53:24.600
Technically, if you don't work for Twitch anymore, but you took something on your

53:24.600 --> 53:25.960
way out the door, you're a third party.

53:25.960 --> 53:27.040
Cause you don't work for him anymore.

53:27.560 --> 53:30.400
I like how they called it a Twitch security incident.

53:31.240 --> 53:31.600
Dude.

53:31.600 --> 53:32.280
Come on.

53:33.560 --> 53:39.000
Uh, DJ Rama S says, and now people are salty because so much streamers are making bank.

53:39.560 --> 53:43.280
Wait until I tell you how much people in Hollywood are making.

53:43.800 --> 53:47.920
Just, just you wait, you know, did you go see that new Bond movie this weekend?

53:48.040 --> 53:50.080
Do you know how much Daniel Craig made for that?

53:50.080 --> 53:51.880
Just wait until I tell you.

53:51.880 --> 53:55.680
I can understand the continuing with the comment Rama says, I can understand because

53:55.680 --> 54:00.360
some streamers throw that in your face, so fuck them, but overall, if you're salty,

54:00.360 --> 54:03.240
the streamers are making more money than you, then it's a personal issue to you.

54:03.640 --> 54:07.120
Uh, and the tiger class says, some will see those earnings and think they should

54:07.120 --> 54:08.520
probably get into Twitch.

54:09.680 --> 54:13.720
Well, I I'm all for enabling more people to get on Twitch because Twitch is a

54:13.720 --> 54:20.200
platform, use the platform and there's, if, if you looked at that list, I think

54:20.200 --> 54:24.200
if you looked at that list, you're going to notice there was very much a trend

54:24.360 --> 54:27.040
within the top a hundred top 500 streamers.

54:27.600 --> 54:32.800
There was a very much a trend in what all those people look like and what

54:32.800 --> 54:34.440
gender they are and so forth.

54:34.520 --> 54:35.080
Sure.

54:35.280 --> 54:38.880
There's exceptions in there, but for the most part, does, do those exceptions

54:38.880 --> 54:41.240
match the exceptions in the population?

54:42.200 --> 54:43.680
No, no.

54:44.440 --> 54:50.760
So, yes, we need more people to get on Twitch, but are they going to want

54:50.760 --> 54:52.120
to do that after this happened?

54:52.160 --> 54:52.640
Doubt it.

54:54.880 --> 54:55.240
Anyway.

54:55.480 --> 54:55.800
All right.

54:55.840 --> 55:01.240
Uh, anything else you want to say on this before I move to the next, uh, I almost

55:01.240 --> 55:02.640
want to read your comment on Arama.

55:02.680 --> 55:04.960
I'm not going to, but I'm just going to acknowledge it because you're talking

55:04.960 --> 55:08.920
about your day job and I'm just kind of winking at you, you know, you know, um,

55:09.400 --> 55:11.760
anything else you want to say, Loki, before we go to the next story?

55:12.040 --> 55:12.920
No, I'm good.

55:13.280 --> 55:18.800
Then let's go to talking about Konami, uh, an old favorite here, uh, you know, back

55:18.800 --> 55:23.680
in the day, not, you know, the Konami that publishes E-Football, but the old Konami

55:23.680 --> 55:24.400
of yesteryear.

55:24.400 --> 55:28.480
So of course, when we talk about retro Konami, this sort of thing really

55:28.480 --> 55:30.200
tugs at our heartstrings.

55:30.440 --> 55:34.200
Konami announced a contest, and this was right around the time we were doing our

55:34.200 --> 55:37.840
show last week, so it missed the cutoff last week, but they announced a contest

55:37.840 --> 55:43.800
where indie developers can create brand new games based on the, uh, portfolio of

55:43.800 --> 55:48.560
brands and classic IPs, not everything, but there's a pretty good, a pretty good

55:48.560 --> 55:53.480
chunk of, uh, quote unquote, forgotten Konami IPs is on this list, not on the

55:53.480 --> 55:53.840
list.

55:53.840 --> 55:56.800
Castlevania, not on the list, Suikoden or Silent Hill.

55:57.040 --> 55:57.440
Yes.

55:57.440 --> 56:02.320
On the list, Jairus, Goemon, uh, Yer Kong Fu, I think is on the list too.

56:02.440 --> 56:03.480
There's a lot of stuff on there.

56:03.800 --> 56:09.520
So, um, whoever wins this contest could get a nice check and potentially some game

56:09.520 --> 56:09.960
sales.

56:10.200 --> 56:14.320
This is a contest being held in collaboration with the Shueisha Game

56:14.320 --> 56:15.240
Developers Camp.

56:15.360 --> 56:21.360
So before January 6, 2022, based upon one of these 80 brands, uh, maybe Darsak will

56:21.360 --> 56:24.720
get a new Twinbee out of this cause that's on the list, uh, and so forth.

56:25.000 --> 56:29.880
Uh, so once you make one of the games based on these brands, then Konami is going to

56:29.880 --> 56:33.560
judge them and the grand prize winner will get 2 million yen.

56:33.560 --> 56:35.800
That's about $18,000 in US dollars.

56:36.080 --> 56:42.360
Uh, but if Konami wants to actually see one of those games come out, they will help

56:42.360 --> 56:44.440
the studio develop and release the game.

56:44.640 --> 56:50.360
That could be up to 30 million or the equivalent of $270,000 to develop,

56:50.360 --> 56:51.960
supervise and so forth.

56:52.240 --> 56:54.120
Um, that's pretty neat.

56:54.360 --> 56:59.760
Now, I posted about this on Twitter after last week's show, and I got a response from

56:59.760 --> 57:02.080
one of our listeners that I really thought was worth reading.

57:02.760 --> 57:06.880
And this was from, uh, 13X Forever who comments a lot in Discord, but I think

57:06.880 --> 57:09.240
because of time zones isn't really here live usually.

57:09.720 --> 57:16.120
And the, uh, response I got was from 13X Forever was, do they compensate the time

57:16.120 --> 57:18.360
spent on this for every contestant?

57:18.680 --> 57:21.600
Do contestants retain the rights on the prototypes they submit?

57:22.000 --> 57:23.960
I guess the answer is no and no.

57:24.280 --> 57:30.160
So basically it's the usual con to exploit over enthusiastic indie devs to give them

57:30.160 --> 57:32.400
a bunch of new ideas for pennies.

57:34.040 --> 57:38.080
As much as that's a cynical perspective, I think it's a fair one, uh, in this, is

57:38.080 --> 57:40.800
that, yeah, not every game is going to get picked.

57:41.000 --> 57:45.960
Could you run into this situation where Konami suddenly puts out their own thing

57:45.960 --> 57:51.320
and it's like, oh, this looks like a lot like the indie developed thing that they

57:51.320 --> 57:52.280
could run into that.

57:52.760 --> 57:58.920
Still, still, I feel like there's a way Y Y R could reskin pixel

57:58.920 --> 58:00.240
poops into a Konami brand.

58:02.520 --> 58:04.560
Call it a pro Evo soccer.

58:07.240 --> 58:08.600
That's that pro Evo pooper.

58:11.480 --> 58:13.560
You better watch out or there's going to be a cheat code.

58:13.560 --> 58:16.320
That's going to make the main character wear a soccer Jersey.

58:18.560 --> 58:20.240
We can really have pro Evo pooper.

58:20.280 --> 58:24.480
Just turn the people that run across in, in the park into soccer players.

58:24.480 --> 58:24.920
There you go.

58:25.040 --> 58:25.400
Done.

58:26.000 --> 58:31.080
Y Y R has, Y Y R has a wife, a child, a job.

58:31.440 --> 58:34.680
I don't think Y Y R is going to enter this contest, but I think of people like Y Y R

58:34.680 --> 58:39.200
and so forth that maybe do want to make a big thing and you know, it could, there

58:39.200 --> 58:44.000
could be a nice thing that develops from this is that, you know, you could maybe,

58:44.280 --> 58:49.360
you know, get your foot in the door with the industry, uh, having this beat could

58:49.360 --> 58:49.920
be a big thing.

58:50.920 --> 58:53.760
That's the same thing as working for exposure, Rob.

58:54.120 --> 58:55.480
And you know what I say about that.

58:56.000 --> 58:59.200
Farron, people die of exposure.

58:59.240 --> 59:02.280
Isn't that what a lot of, isn't that what a lot of indie

59:02.280 --> 59:03.520
developers are doing anyway?

59:07.760 --> 59:09.520
Not, I mean, what are we doing?

59:10.560 --> 59:13.320
Well, we're doing it for, I reiterate, we're not on the list.

59:13.360 --> 59:13.600
You're right.

59:13.600 --> 59:14.520
We're doing it for, right.

59:14.560 --> 59:15.440
We're doing it for fun.

59:16.080 --> 59:16.720
There you go.

59:16.800 --> 59:17.320
That's it.

59:17.480 --> 59:19.280
Don't do this unless it's going to be fun.

59:19.440 --> 59:22.560
Because the cynical side of that and all that, you know, very, you know,

59:22.560 --> 59:24.840
and I say cynical, but I don't, I don't mean it in a negative way.

59:24.840 --> 59:26.920
It's a very realistic perspective and so forth.

59:27.200 --> 59:29.320
So yes, keep that in the back of your mind.

59:29.320 --> 59:32.200
But if you're sitting there going, it might be kind of fun to make a gyrus

59:32.200 --> 59:33.680
game, just, just to see what happens.

59:34.040 --> 59:36.360
Like Loki, you're a game maker now.

59:36.400 --> 59:37.520
You want to enter the contest?

59:38.080 --> 59:38.520
No.

59:38.840 --> 59:39.200
Okay.

59:39.200 --> 59:40.120
Well then it's not fun.

59:41.800 --> 59:45.720
I don't, I don't want to make any new games for there.

59:45.760 --> 59:47.840
Well, I mean, a new Contra game would be awesome.

59:48.360 --> 59:51.360
See, now we're going, I don't know if that was on the list though, but it

59:51.360 --> 59:55.120
wasn't probably, you know, cause they're, they're too busy ruining their own

59:55.120 --> 59:59.720
franchises, you know, they need other people to make, you know, all right.

59:59.720 --> 01:00:04.120
I'm looking at that enough that we exist in a world that there's a Frogger TV

01:00:04.120 --> 01:00:06.840
show that is blasphemy as it is.

01:00:06.880 --> 01:00:11.600
I don't care how removed far removed it is from the actual Frogger game.

01:00:11.880 --> 01:00:13.040
It's blasphemy.

01:00:13.080 --> 01:00:13.600
Okay.

01:00:14.240 --> 01:00:16.640
Blasphemy bless for you.

01:00:16.640 --> 01:00:17.720
I laughed so hard.

01:00:17.720 --> 01:00:19.200
My earpiece just fell out.

01:00:20.280 --> 01:00:21.040
That's not good.

01:00:21.520 --> 01:00:21.920
All right.

01:00:23.280 --> 01:00:23.680
Anyway.

01:00:23.680 --> 01:00:24.000
All right.

01:00:24.040 --> 01:00:28.200
Uh, I'm also looking at chat and people are just going E-poop ball,

01:00:28.240 --> 01:00:30.800
uh, pixelvania, soccer shits.

01:00:30.840 --> 01:00:32.760
They're just, they're just going crazy.

01:00:33.040 --> 01:00:34.520
Uh, soccer shits.

01:00:34.600 --> 01:00:37.120
Fifth dream in chat says Russian attack.

01:00:37.120 --> 01:00:37.320
Oops.

01:00:37.320 --> 01:00:38.760
I thought I was in a Google window.

01:00:39.960 --> 01:00:42.480
They remade Russian attack not that long ago.

01:00:42.600 --> 01:00:43.600
It wasn't very good.

01:00:43.600 --> 01:00:45.200
Xbox 360 arcade thing.

01:00:45.680 --> 01:00:47.480
Where it was just the old arcade game with new graphics.

01:00:47.560 --> 01:00:48.120
Yeah, it was all right.

01:00:48.600 --> 01:00:53.360
It wasn't, I think they changed up some stuff, but yeah, it wasn't all Kate.

01:00:53.640 --> 01:00:54.880
And orange, right?

01:00:54.880 --> 01:00:56.520
Says poop and attack.

01:00:56.800 --> 01:00:57.360
Oh my God.

01:00:57.400 --> 01:00:58.040
That's it.

01:00:58.240 --> 01:00:58.600
That's it.

01:00:58.600 --> 01:00:59.040
Oh my God.

01:00:59.040 --> 01:00:59.520
That's it.

01:00:59.680 --> 01:01:00.200
Loki.

01:01:00.200 --> 01:01:03.520
Just brand your game, poop and attack and see what happens.

01:01:04.880 --> 01:01:05.800
Oh, Frogger.

01:01:07.520 --> 01:01:08.040
All right.

01:01:08.160 --> 01:01:12.560
Moving on for those pooper, for those newer to orange launch radio, who don't

01:01:12.600 --> 01:01:15.000
maybe understand the joke, uh, there was a

01:01:15.040 --> 01:01:16.800
we're five years old and like poop jokes.

01:01:16.920 --> 01:01:21.160
Basically, namely dark Sakura, uh, said.

01:01:21.720 --> 01:01:22.920
Got years ago.

01:01:22.960 --> 01:01:24.920
Like we have this list of dream games.

01:01:25.040 --> 01:01:28.120
Suddenly we'll be on a tangent train and we'll say, Hey, this game should exist.

01:01:28.320 --> 01:01:30.960
And dark Sakura came up with this idea for pixel shits.

01:01:30.960 --> 01:01:33.320
And it was just about, I don't know, I guess it was about shitting on things.

01:01:33.520 --> 01:01:36.800
Anyway, one of our listeners even come up with that because I'm stupid.

01:01:36.840 --> 01:01:38.320
I don't even know.

01:01:38.320 --> 01:01:39.400
We'll have to go back to the archive.

01:01:39.400 --> 01:01:40.480
I don't even remember what episode it was on.

01:01:40.880 --> 01:01:41.560
Anyway, why?

01:01:41.560 --> 01:01:45.200
Why are one of our listeners and a great indie game maker?

01:01:45.200 --> 01:01:45.440
Why?

01:01:45.440 --> 01:01:46.720
Why are games.com?

01:01:46.720 --> 01:01:47.960
I hope I got his website right.

01:01:47.960 --> 01:01:51.280
I who's made a lot of great games, made that game into a reality.

01:01:51.480 --> 01:01:57.040
Then in in a moment of, wow, how how recursive can things get here?

01:01:57.240 --> 01:02:01.880
Loki goes and makes a sequel pixel poops number two.

01:02:03.440 --> 01:02:06.720
So if if you're wondering why are we sitting here talking about pixel

01:02:06.760 --> 01:02:11.400
shits all night, because it is a indie indie game, we sort of started that like

01:02:11.600 --> 01:02:13.840
is an actual thing you can get on itch.io and steam.

01:02:14.040 --> 01:02:16.200
So check it out if you haven't already.

01:02:16.400 --> 01:02:18.640
All right, let's move on.

01:02:18.840 --> 01:02:21.000
I don't even know what I'm on anymore, Rob.

01:02:21.200 --> 01:02:24.120
Let's talk about other things that took a big shit this week.

01:02:24.320 --> 01:02:27.200
Dark Sakura, I laughed my ass off.

01:02:27.400 --> 01:02:30.200
This was funny. I did because I didn't get affected at all.

01:02:30.400 --> 01:02:31.520
This was great news.

01:02:31.720 --> 01:02:33.760
I had a great morning this morning.

01:02:33.960 --> 01:02:34.920
Oh, gosh.

01:02:35.080 --> 01:02:38.480
So Facebook,

01:02:38.680 --> 01:02:43.720
the thing I have successfully extracted myself mostly from.

01:02:43.920 --> 01:02:45.400
Um.

01:02:45.600 --> 01:02:52.040
Went down, it went down, it went down hard, not just that, Instagram, WhatsApp

01:02:52.240 --> 01:03:01.000
and the the 11th circle of hell called Facebook, um, we're gone.

01:03:01.200 --> 01:03:02.640
Like.

01:03:02.880 --> 01:03:06.680
Someone sent me an Instagram link and I tried to look at it and I'm like, whoa.

01:03:06.880 --> 01:03:09.680
And it was it was learned it was very this.

01:03:09.880 --> 01:03:12.160
The last Facebook is in captivity.

01:03:12.360 --> 01:03:15.320
The galaxy is at peace, that peace.

01:03:15.520 --> 01:03:18.680
Yes, for five hours on a Monday morning.

01:03:18.880 --> 01:03:22.680
And everybody in the 60 and up demographic

01:03:22.880 --> 01:03:28.160
nowhere to go, couldn't play Farmville or whatever they're doing now.

01:03:28.360 --> 01:03:31.680
Um, anyway, um.

01:03:31.880 --> 01:03:33.400
So.

01:03:34.680 --> 01:03:38.040
Deleting, it was if I think it did affect

01:03:38.240 --> 01:03:42.520
people who were using Oculus, weren't it, didn't it?

01:03:42.720 --> 01:03:46.400
Oh, yes, because your Oculus stuff is tied to Facebook.

01:03:46.600 --> 01:03:47.920
Yeah.

01:03:48.960 --> 01:03:49.680
Yeah.

01:03:49.880 --> 01:03:56.600
And then it was they basically posted that, yeah, some people, quote,

01:03:56.800 --> 01:04:00.040
this is a bullshit post, were having trouble accessing their apps

01:04:00.080 --> 01:04:04.200
and games, but they were working to get it back to normal,

01:04:04.400 --> 01:04:09.720
which unfortunately they did and a huge amount of the VR contingent cried out.

01:04:09.920 --> 01:04:14.000
This is why we didn't want this bullshit in Oculus.

01:04:14.200 --> 01:04:19.200
I like, um, the quote from FIFA Mobile.

01:04:19.400 --> 01:04:23.960
We're aware that a counseling to Facebook may be encountering issues with logging in.

01:04:24.160 --> 01:04:27.600
This is due to an outage at Facebook and we hope they resolve it shortly.

01:04:27.600 --> 01:04:28.800
Thanks for your patience.

01:04:28.800 --> 01:04:32.520
I saw Niantic put a thing out for Pokemon Go, too, because a lot of people

01:04:32.720 --> 01:04:38.240
that with Facebook, this this is why you don't have Facebook log into your shit for you.

01:04:38.440 --> 01:04:39.440
And here's the thing.

01:04:39.640 --> 01:04:45.400
I, of course, saw the oh, so socially aware Twitter contingent

01:04:45.600 --> 01:04:49.640
that was saying we shouldn't be celebrating this because there's people

01:04:49.840 --> 01:04:53.760
in other countries that use WhatsApp for their primary communication.

01:04:53.760 --> 01:04:56.000
And WhatsApp is basically like the phone to them.

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:58.080
And you all are taking delight in these

01:04:58.080 --> 01:05:01.120
communications being down in these countries where it's needed.

01:05:01.320 --> 01:05:04.360
And I'm thinking, hold up.

01:05:04.560 --> 01:05:09.720
There's a difference between taking delight and being well aware that maybe,

01:05:09.920 --> 01:05:15.040
maybe this should give us all pause to something that a lot of us have been

01:05:15.040 --> 01:05:19.880
saying for some time now, and that is how many fucking cookie jars Facebook has

01:05:20.080 --> 01:05:25.080
their hands in. It is 100 percent OK and no, you will not shut me up to say,

01:05:25.240 --> 01:05:29.000
well, maybe Facebook shouldn't own WhatsApp if it's

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:31.120
that fucking important in all these countries.

01:05:31.320 --> 01:05:34.360
Maybe Facebook and WhatsApp should be separated.

01:05:34.560 --> 01:05:39.120
And that's the conversation you and I both should be having and not you coming

01:05:39.320 --> 01:05:43.200
for me going, but what about the people in the what?

01:05:43.400 --> 01:05:47.040
Stop, stop.

01:05:47.240 --> 01:05:48.880
Like nothing pissed me off more than that.

01:05:48.880 --> 01:05:51.440
I'm sorry, but it's like, who are you trying to impress?

01:05:51.640 --> 01:05:53.160
Who are you trying to impress?

01:05:53.320 --> 01:05:54.880
Do you want to suck Zuckerberg's cock

01:05:54.880 --> 01:05:56.840
while you're at it, because that's basically what you're doing.

01:05:57.040 --> 01:05:58.600
Stop it.

01:06:00.200 --> 01:06:02.320
I have feelings, sorry.

01:06:02.520 --> 01:06:04.360
Tiger Claw on chat says, my parents use

01:06:04.360 --> 01:06:06.840
WhatsApp because we have relatives in Cuba who use it.

01:06:06.960 --> 01:06:10.760
I'm sorry, that line of communication went down for five days or five, five days,

01:06:10.960 --> 01:06:14.400
five hours, and I hope that maybe this gives us all

01:06:14.600 --> 01:06:19.560
question to should these, should Facebook have control over a company like this?

01:06:19.680 --> 01:06:21.720
Or should we be looking at alternatives

01:06:21.920 --> 01:06:27.400
like Signal, like Telegram, like there's a lot of choices out there.

01:06:27.600 --> 01:06:29.720
Pick any of them.

01:06:31.680 --> 01:06:36.480
Sia Tabiri in chat says they broke up AT&T from AT&T Mobile in the 90s.

01:06:36.680 --> 01:06:38.920
Oh, yeah, that came right back.

01:06:39.120 --> 01:06:40.360
They need to do it again.

01:06:40.560 --> 01:06:42.840
Yeah, that's true.

01:06:43.040 --> 01:06:47.520
Anyway, like all of the telecoms, Comcast,

01:06:47.720 --> 01:06:50.640
you know, NBC, you know,

01:06:50.840 --> 01:06:53.760
all of them, just all of them.

01:06:53.960 --> 01:06:55.360
Dark Sakura,

01:06:55.560 --> 01:06:58.760
I know old man was yelling at Cloud for a little bit, but I don't think you disagree

01:06:58.760 --> 01:07:02.040
either. You have some similar feelings, I think, when it comes to the Facebooks.

01:07:02.040 --> 01:07:02.800
Yes.

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:05.280
Yeah, I mean.

01:07:05.480 --> 01:07:08.400
I find the place to be a cesspool

01:07:08.600 --> 01:07:15.440
and not just with how it tracks and steals information,

01:07:15.600 --> 01:07:20.560
but also with, I'm trying to think of how I want to phrase this,

01:07:20.760 --> 01:07:22.760
with a certain culture that's fostered there.

01:07:22.960 --> 01:07:27.400
And I'm not just talking about the right wing red people, you know,

01:07:27.600 --> 01:07:32.320
but I'm also talking about the echo chamber of the

01:07:32.520 --> 01:07:35.200
the left massive echo chamber.

01:07:35.400 --> 01:07:38.760
Sure. And it encourages that sort of circular

01:07:38.960 --> 01:07:42.760
type of discussion with so much confirmation bias.

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:48.360
And because that's what they're promoting, those are the posts that you see first

01:07:48.560 --> 01:07:52.640
or the we want you to get mad about this thing that other people are doing so we

01:07:52.840 --> 01:07:57.560
can make profit off of your anger and there is so much sell me underwear.

01:07:57.760 --> 01:08:00.200
So, you know, that's the thing.

01:08:00.400 --> 01:08:04.760
It was a very stressful place for me and my life has been a lot better without it.

01:08:04.960 --> 01:08:06.680
Loki, if you want it to stop showing you

01:08:06.680 --> 01:08:09.600
underwear ads or whatever, there is a place you can go in and erase

01:08:09.600 --> 01:08:10.960
like everything it's tracking on.

01:08:11.200 --> 01:08:14.800
I know I just use an ad blocker anyway, so whatever.

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:19.040
Well, I'm on my mobile phone, so that's why it's just you can get ad block

01:08:19.240 --> 01:08:22.920
for a mobile phone, I know, but I'm getting a new mobile phone here pretty soon.

01:08:22.920 --> 01:08:24.400
So I haven't really bothered with it.

01:08:24.600 --> 01:08:28.760
Here's the thing, too, with with Facebook and all that stuff is that there's also

01:08:28.960 --> 01:08:32.200
so much international influence going on on there like Facebook.

01:08:32.200 --> 01:08:36.040
You know, I don't want to sound drastic, but I said this in a chat the other day.

01:08:36.040 --> 01:08:37.920
I said there is a world war being fought

01:08:37.960 --> 01:08:41.640
right now and it's being fought on Facebook and the weapon is misinformation.

01:08:41.840 --> 01:08:44.360
And guess what? America is losing.

01:08:44.560 --> 01:08:46.520
It's almost like they had a whistleblower

01:08:46.520 --> 01:08:49.400
come out and say the same exact thing the same day it went down.

01:08:49.600 --> 01:08:53.040
It's so weird and I don't mean to be old boomer yells at cloud,

01:08:53.040 --> 01:08:54.400
which is apparently the theme tonight,

01:08:54.400 --> 01:08:56.600
but I don't care because I do also think that's kind of important.

01:08:56.600 --> 01:08:59.720
And yes, this does have to do with gaming because we have Facebook gaming.

01:08:59.720 --> 01:09:02.120
We have all of this comes into gaming culture and all that stuff.

01:09:02.320 --> 01:09:05.800
And I'm so happy that the government is finally doing something and looking

01:09:05.800 --> 01:09:08.440
into it because, yes, there are a lot of problems with Facebook.

01:09:08.640 --> 01:09:10.520
Let's tie it to something else that was in the news.

01:09:10.520 --> 01:09:12.280
Twitch with this hack and all this stuff

01:09:12.480 --> 01:09:15.120
and the hate raids, something they did recently.

01:09:15.120 --> 01:09:18.760
I even have two factor authentication on my account and I still had to do this.

01:09:18.920 --> 01:09:21.840
I wanted to chat in somebody's channel and it said, hold on,

01:09:21.840 --> 01:09:24.120
we need to text you to verify this account first.

01:09:24.320 --> 01:09:26.680
And OK, so I did that whole thing.

01:09:26.880 --> 01:09:30.640
Why doesn't Facebook do this?

01:09:30.840 --> 01:09:35.120
Make you text, verify your accounts the same way that Twitch does it,

01:09:35.120 --> 01:09:39.680
you have to use an SMS number and you can't use a Google thing.

01:09:39.680 --> 01:09:41.280
You can't use a burner account to do it.

01:09:41.480 --> 01:09:43.920
It has to be a legitimate SMS number.

01:09:43.920 --> 01:09:44.880
Why can't they do that?

01:09:44.880 --> 01:09:46.480
Why can't they take that simple step

01:09:46.680 --> 01:09:50.160
to ensure that the people on there are who they say they are?

01:09:50.160 --> 01:09:52.880
And if somebody doesn't have the phone, well, then you know what?

01:09:53.080 --> 01:09:54.720
They don't they don't have the Facebook

01:09:54.920 --> 01:09:58.120
mobile app anyway, so they're no views to Facebook.

01:09:58.320 --> 01:10:00.880
Facebook could take that precaution tomorrow,

01:10:01.080 --> 01:10:04.040
but they're not going to until it was their bottom line.

01:10:04.040 --> 01:10:05.520
It's just like what they go, you know,

01:10:05.720 --> 01:10:09.960
go what the whistleblower saying is that they could stop hate speech

01:10:10.160 --> 01:10:13.000
or at least could curb some of the misinformation on there.

01:10:13.080 --> 01:10:15.640
But then it would drop engagement, which hurts their bottom line.

01:10:15.840 --> 01:10:20.800
They make decisions that really only benefit their bottom line, which is money.

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:24.920
They don't really care, just like how it's super frustrating that I go on there

01:10:25.120 --> 01:10:28.560
and I can't just view stuff chronologically, please.

01:10:28.760 --> 01:10:31.200
Even like Twitter does the same thing now

01:10:31.200 --> 01:10:33.800
where it's like kind of annoying, they mix stuff up in there.

01:10:33.800 --> 01:10:37.000
But for the most part, at least it's somewhat chronological.

01:10:37.200 --> 01:10:39.760
And you can switch if I could find something.

01:10:39.960 --> 01:10:42.840
You can carry this very easily on Twitter.

01:10:43.040 --> 01:10:45.480
That's why I don't get Twitter as much shit.

01:10:45.680 --> 01:10:50.880
But like, you know, with with Facebook, at least like I do like I do use Facebook

01:10:51.080 --> 01:10:54.280
for some of the groups I'm in for like Minecraft and stuff like that.

01:10:54.480 --> 01:10:57.840
So I'll like browser those, which those are fine.

01:10:58.040 --> 01:10:59.000
But.

01:10:59.200 --> 01:11:03.280
It's just it's I always have to constantly set it to go in chronological order.

01:11:03.280 --> 01:11:05.600
It's like, no, we want you to see it this way.

01:11:05.800 --> 01:11:06.800
And it's irritating.

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:09.320
Like, I just can't like I'll find something.

01:11:09.520 --> 01:11:13.640
I'll jump out of the app for a second to go look something up in like my web

01:11:13.840 --> 01:11:16.320
browser, come back, and then it's already gone.

01:11:16.520 --> 01:11:18.080
Like I can't find it again.

01:11:18.280 --> 01:11:19.920
I have a Facebook, too, and I hate it.

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:22.440
If I didn't have it, I would miss out on big news.

01:11:22.640 --> 01:11:24.320
I would miss out on people getting married

01:11:24.320 --> 01:11:26.760
and having babies because that's just the way it is now.

01:11:26.960 --> 01:11:29.960
And it sucks. Rob, what

01:11:30.120 --> 01:11:34.640
if my friends care enough about me to involve me in that part of their life,

01:11:34.840 --> 01:11:38.720
they'll fucking tell me sometimes the news may not be good.

01:11:38.840 --> 01:11:40.520
And I'm just going to have to leave it at that.

01:11:40.720 --> 01:11:44.000
And that was I have other friends that have been telling me about it.

01:11:44.200 --> 01:11:50.840
But I I'm really to the point where if somebody doesn't tell me.

01:11:51.040 --> 01:11:53.920
If somebody doesn't think enough to bring

01:11:53.920 --> 01:11:57.280
it to my attention, to think this is something I'm interested in,

01:11:57.440 --> 01:12:01.920
like I found out about Barbara through Tiara,

01:12:02.120 --> 01:12:03.640
but.

01:12:03.840 --> 01:12:09.360
I am still not going to give Facebook my attention.

01:12:09.560 --> 01:12:12.080
I'm not going to give it my cookies.

01:12:12.280 --> 01:12:17.160
I posted once in the last, what, three months

01:12:17.360 --> 01:12:20.840
for that damn marathon I'm doing tomorrow and that's it.

01:12:21.040 --> 01:12:22.520
I do not care.

01:12:22.720 --> 01:12:27.040
And if people do not care enough about me to tell me.

01:12:27.520 --> 01:12:29.960
About what's going on with them.

01:12:30.160 --> 01:12:32.800
Then that's on them, that's not on me.

01:12:35.200 --> 01:12:37.800
Everything I don't care about how easy it is either.

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:40.000
This is addressing what Rama said.

01:12:40.200 --> 01:12:42.360
I don't care about it being fucking easy.

01:12:42.560 --> 01:12:47.320
If someone cares enough to involve me in their life,

01:12:47.520 --> 01:12:51.640
they are going to fucking tell me there was a world without Facebook.

01:12:51.840 --> 01:12:54.680
That we're we're old enough to have experienced, yes.

01:12:54.920 --> 01:12:57.680
And then the other thing I want to say with Twitter, everything I was screaming

01:12:57.680 --> 01:13:00.240
about with Facebook and the phone number verification.

01:13:00.240 --> 01:13:02.200
I honestly want Twitter to do it, too.

01:13:02.400 --> 01:13:03.840
I want any social media site to do it.

01:13:03.840 --> 01:13:04.680
I think it's a good idea.

01:13:04.680 --> 01:13:07.040
There should always be some sort of two factor authentication.

01:13:07.240 --> 01:13:08.120
There should be that.

01:13:08.320 --> 01:13:11.960
And just verifying that the number is in the US full stop because

01:13:12.160 --> 01:13:16.280
Twitter has a huge foreign manipulation bot program problem.

01:13:16.480 --> 01:13:21.520
Huge. It's very easy to filter it out because you don't have my.

01:13:22.520 --> 01:13:27.880
You don't have my stupid cousins buying into that bullshit on on Twitter

01:13:28.080 --> 01:13:31.520
that you do on Facebook, but it's definitely there and there are people

01:13:31.720 --> 01:13:33.240
falling for it.

01:13:34.080 --> 01:13:35.280
Anyway,

01:13:35.480 --> 01:13:40.200
now that we're done yelling at clouds, let's move on to our next story.

01:13:40.400 --> 01:13:43.280
One last thing, one less teeny thing.

01:13:43.480 --> 01:13:45.120
Yes, Star Stalker, of course.

01:13:45.320 --> 01:13:48.040
People have forgotten how to talk to each other.

01:13:48.760 --> 01:13:51.440
That's it. People have forgotten how to talk to each other.

01:13:51.640 --> 01:13:55.240
People will sit there and go, why is the world so polarized?

01:13:55.440 --> 01:13:57.600
When did the US become so polarized?

01:13:57.800 --> 01:13:59.240
It's Facebook.

01:13:59.440 --> 01:14:01.640
I just the two there's the two world answer.

01:14:01.840 --> 01:14:04.280
There's the two word answer to all of the problems.

01:14:04.480 --> 01:14:06.080
It's Facebook.

01:14:06.600 --> 01:14:07.400
That's it.

01:14:07.600 --> 01:14:11.520
Any problem that this country is having with polarization, it's Facebook.

01:14:11.720 --> 01:14:17.200
Any problem with the vaccine and the elections and it's Facebook.

01:14:17.400 --> 01:14:18.760
Yep.

01:14:19.760 --> 01:14:22.360
The reason why that Emmy killed me in

01:14:22.360 --> 01:14:25.000
Metroid Dread when I wasn't expecting it, somehow it was Facebook.

01:14:25.200 --> 01:14:26.880
I know it. Moving on.

01:14:27.080 --> 01:14:31.720
I think it was different when we had things like MySpace and LiveJournal

01:14:31.920 --> 01:14:35.960
because MySpace was really just like sort of like a short little, you know.

01:14:36.160 --> 01:14:37.800
It was easy.

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:40.080
It was more Twittery, if that makes sense.

01:14:40.280 --> 01:14:47.000
And LiveJournal for us was basically a public diary.

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:51.720
But, yeah, looking at some comments in chat here,

01:14:51.920 --> 01:14:55.760
I am trying to move on past this topic, but I know you're fine.

01:14:55.960 --> 01:14:58.200
Sacred Jade said conversation is a lost art.

01:14:58.400 --> 01:15:00.960
I thought this was because a lot of people agree with this.

01:15:00.960 --> 01:15:04.960
Fifth Dream says I never wanted to talk to people in the first place

01:15:05.160 --> 01:15:10.800
and kind of goes on and talks about some other problems that existed before Facebook.

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:12.800
Sure, those problems all existed,

01:15:12.800 --> 01:15:15.600
but Facebook amplified it and Facebook

01:15:15.800 --> 01:15:19.200
allowed additional noise to make that conversation even worse.

01:15:19.400 --> 01:15:21.960
But it's like human microphone, right?

01:15:22.160 --> 01:15:23.040
Yeah. Yeah.

01:15:23.240 --> 01:15:25.320
All right. In an echo chamber.

01:15:25.520 --> 01:15:26.760
In everyone's bathroom.

01:15:26.960 --> 01:15:28.200
OK, moving on.

01:15:28.400 --> 01:15:30.040
Next story, Loki.

01:15:30.240 --> 01:15:33.120
So speaking of stuff from the past,

01:15:33.320 --> 01:15:35.480
we finally are catching up from the past

01:15:35.680 --> 01:15:39.520
with Epic Games Store as they're adding achievements.

01:15:39.680 --> 01:15:42.840
Oh, my God, it's about damn time.

01:15:43.040 --> 01:15:45.600
They're like only several years behind everybody.

01:15:45.800 --> 01:15:48.640
Not behind as Nintendo, but, you know, I digress.

01:15:48.840 --> 01:15:51.120
So they're going to be adding a new achievement system.

01:15:51.320 --> 01:15:56.200
It kind of is like a combination of the achievement points that you get on the

01:15:56.400 --> 01:16:02.960
Xbox side of things and the like different trophies that you would get on the PlayStation side.

01:16:03.160 --> 01:16:07.520
So they're going to basically have each game is going to have a thousand XP.

01:16:07.720 --> 01:16:12.240
And with that, they're going to be different achievements that are ranked.

01:16:12.440 --> 01:16:15.360
You have bronze, which is five to forty five points,

01:16:15.560 --> 01:16:21.560
fifty to ninety five for silver, 100 to 200 for gold and 250 for platinum.

01:16:21.760 --> 01:16:26.280
And it's like, how can we steal from PlayStation and Microsoft system and kind

01:16:26.480 --> 01:16:30.920
of combine it into that hybrid Voltron of achievement systems?

01:16:31.120 --> 01:16:36.600
Yeah, so it's going to be very similar to what we see on other platforms, basically.

01:16:36.800 --> 01:16:38.360
So it's about time.

01:16:38.560 --> 01:16:42.960
It also kind of actually makes sense because a lot of those games on the Epic

01:16:43.160 --> 01:16:46.960
Store and any PC game really also exist on consoles.

01:16:47.160 --> 01:16:49.160
And so a lot of developers don't want

01:16:49.360 --> 01:16:52.640
to have to make separate trophy slash achievement systems for that.

01:16:52.840 --> 01:16:56.720
It's very nice when it just kind of all lines up, you know.

01:16:56.920 --> 01:16:58.840
And maybe what's a bronze trophy here is

01:16:59.040 --> 01:17:03.440
20 points here is both on the Epic Store, I guess, or whatever the case is.

01:17:03.640 --> 01:17:04.800
So.

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:06.560
There's that.

01:17:07.480 --> 01:17:10.280
Do they need achievements?

01:17:10.480 --> 01:17:14.240
Like a lot of people are saying it's three years too late or whatever,

01:17:14.440 --> 01:17:16.960
Nintendo's gotten away with not doing achievements for a long time.

01:17:17.160 --> 01:17:20.200
I think we'd all like them to have it, but.

01:17:20.400 --> 01:17:22.600
Yeah, it's I think that they do.

01:17:22.600 --> 01:17:24.440
I mean, it would be nice to have that just

01:17:24.640 --> 01:17:27.600
to have be more robust and more feature complete.

01:17:27.800 --> 01:17:29.600
I mean, they're still.

01:17:29.800 --> 01:17:32.800
Stopping carts and other things that they really need on the storefront.

01:17:32.800 --> 01:17:37.280
I mean, honestly, like we really shouldn't have early access shopping places.

01:17:37.480 --> 01:17:41.400
It should just be complete already, but.

01:17:41.600 --> 01:17:43.840
It's Epic Game Store, so whatever.

01:17:44.040 --> 01:17:48.200
At least I get free PC building simulator this week.

01:17:48.400 --> 01:17:49.640
Oh, yeah, I picked that up, too.

01:17:49.640 --> 01:17:51.120
Bobby Black Wolf pointed that out to me.

01:17:51.120 --> 01:17:53.960
I was like, you should get this. I'm like, OK, because I'm all about right now.

01:17:54.160 --> 01:17:55.720
Yeah, I do want to play that.

01:17:55.920 --> 01:17:58.040
All right. But yeah, that's it.

01:17:58.240 --> 01:17:59.120
All right.

01:17:59.320 --> 01:18:01.680
Moving on to our next story.

01:18:01.840 --> 01:18:05.400
We had a famous video game composer who passed away this week,

01:18:05.600 --> 01:18:10.200
the composer of Dragon Quest, Kochi Sugiyama, passed away at the age of 90.

01:18:10.400 --> 01:18:14.080
You may know him from the iconic theme to Dragon Quest.

01:18:14.280 --> 01:18:17.280
He passed away at the age of 90.

01:18:17.480 --> 01:18:20.880
Let's go on to our next story, Dark Sakura.

01:18:21.080 --> 01:18:23.440
May his memory be a blessing.

01:18:23.640 --> 01:18:25.200
So

01:18:25.600 --> 01:18:31.360
well, more in the Activision Blizzard bullshit drama.

01:18:31.560 --> 01:18:34.000
And I mean, the bullshit is that they're full of bullshit,

01:18:34.200 --> 01:18:40.360
but now the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing,

01:18:40.560 --> 01:18:47.600
DFEH, has filed a motion to intervene in the settlement between the U.S.

01:18:47.800 --> 01:18:51.040
Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and Activision Blizzard,

01:18:51.200 --> 01:18:55.840
arguing that their own trial against

01:18:56.040 --> 01:19:02.040
against the company will be irreparably damaged by the conditions of the settlement.

01:19:02.240 --> 01:19:06.400
The settlement also includes a clause that will

01:19:06.600 --> 01:19:10.600
request that will allow Activision Blizzard to remove

01:19:10.800 --> 01:19:16.000
any allegations of sexual harassment from personnel files in the settlement.

01:19:16.200 --> 01:19:22.640
So basically, it's destroying evidence that's going to go for DFEH's trial.

01:19:23.840 --> 01:19:27.080
They actually met with both

01:19:27.280 --> 01:19:34.040
Activision Blizzard and EEOC on October 5th to let them know of its plan to intervene.

01:19:34.240 --> 01:19:37.640
Normally, they'd have to wait seven days before filing for the intervention.

01:19:37.840 --> 01:19:42.880
But because of the grave harm, they filed the motion ex parte,

01:19:42.920 --> 01:19:44.520
which basically allows it to be filed

01:19:44.720 --> 01:19:48.400
instantly if the court finds it to be a reasonable request.

01:19:48.600 --> 01:19:49.960
So

01:19:50.160 --> 01:19:52.160
and of course,

01:19:52.360 --> 01:19:55.800
you can see why something like that would be absolutely important,

01:19:56.000 --> 01:20:01.120
because if they have the permission to destroy this evidence,

01:20:01.320 --> 01:20:04.480
then they're just going to keep doing it.

01:20:04.680 --> 01:20:08.680
That's the whole fucking terrible thing about settling like that.

01:20:08.760 --> 01:20:12.080
And they have a history of

01:20:12.280 --> 01:20:14.520
of destroying evidence.

01:20:14.720 --> 01:20:18.640
Two months ago, DFEH accused the company

01:20:18.840 --> 01:20:22.360
of shredding evidence that would reflect on

01:20:22.560 --> 01:20:29.080
the company poorly in in the same case with their also

01:20:29.280 --> 01:20:32.640
you know, the fact that they've hired a union busting firm and they're trying to

01:20:32.840 --> 01:20:35.760
do a lot of sweeping under the table.

01:20:36.760 --> 01:20:38.760
They're

01:20:39.760 --> 01:20:42.160
they're not it's not a pretty look for them.

01:20:42.160 --> 01:20:43.720
We know they've tried to do it before.

01:20:43.920 --> 01:20:44.880
We know what they're doing.

01:20:45.080 --> 01:20:47.200
It's obvious what they're doing.

01:20:47.400 --> 01:20:52.320
And I'm really glad the DFEH is saying, hey, we're not having this shit.

01:20:52.520 --> 01:20:54.400
No bad company.

01:20:54.600 --> 01:20:56.160
No cookie.

01:20:56.680 --> 01:20:58.680
I don't have anything else to add.

01:20:58.680 --> 01:21:01.600
I'm looking forward to the deposition of Bobby Kotek.

01:21:01.800 --> 01:21:03.480
Yeah.

01:21:04.360 --> 01:21:10.120
Kotaku, by the way, it's where I don't like to say certain things by name,

01:21:10.320 --> 01:21:15.000
but they actually did get a statement from Activision Blizzard.

01:21:15.200 --> 01:21:18.000
Sure, I'll read it verbatim.

01:21:18.200 --> 01:21:20.920
We are committed to making Activision Blizzard the most welcoming,

01:21:20.920 --> 01:21:22.720
inclusive and safe workplace possible.

01:21:22.920 --> 01:21:25.160
Our agreement with the EEOC reflects our

01:21:25.360 --> 01:21:29.400
commitment to significant improvements and transparency, as well as making

01:21:29.440 --> 01:21:33.640
immediate compensation available to eligible employees who choose to participate.

01:21:33.840 --> 01:21:36.960
Activision Blizzard is ensuring a workplace free from

01:21:36.960 --> 01:21:39.560
discrimination, harassment and unequal treatment of any time.

01:21:39.560 --> 01:21:41.040
Bullshit.

01:21:41.240 --> 01:21:42.960
Bullshit.

01:21:43.160 --> 01:21:47.040
I mean, like in the settlement, it states

01:21:47.240 --> 01:21:49.840
and I'll go ahead and just also verbatim this,

01:21:49.840 --> 01:21:53.120
because I think it's important to listen to the language of it.

01:21:53.320 --> 01:21:54.880
Within 30 days from the date,

01:21:54.880 --> 01:22:00.280
the EEOC notifies Activision Blizzard the names on the distribution lists.

01:22:00.480 --> 01:22:05.400
They agreed to A, remove the personnel files of each eligible claimant,

01:22:05.600 --> 01:22:09.040
any references to the allegations related to sexual harassment,

01:22:09.240 --> 01:22:14.480
pregnancy discrimination and or related retaliation, except to the extent

01:22:14.680 --> 01:22:18.800
that defendants must keep records of the allegations for any eligible claimants

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:23.880
involvement in this charge in order to effect this, effectuate this decree,

01:22:24.080 --> 01:22:26.640
which in case such records must be maintained

01:22:26.840 --> 01:22:31.720
separately from the eligible claimants personnel files.

01:22:32.560 --> 01:22:34.400
Does that make sense to people?

01:22:34.600 --> 01:22:36.480
Because it says.

01:22:36.680 --> 01:22:42.720
They can delete it and the other stuff has to be kept separate from the personnel file.

01:22:42.920 --> 01:22:44.400
And

01:22:44.600 --> 01:22:48.200
I'll just say, I think Tigerclaw puts it very succinctly in our chat over

01:22:48.200 --> 01:22:51.440
at twitch.tv slash VOG Network saying destroying the evidence just makes it

01:22:51.480 --> 01:22:53.600
sound like they're guilty of something.

01:22:53.800 --> 01:22:55.320
Well, there's even more to this.

01:22:55.520 --> 01:22:58.880
This has to do with evidence of us not doing this thing.

01:22:58.880 --> 01:23:02.720
We just can get rid of some of it and we'll still find, as I was saying,

01:23:02.920 --> 01:23:06.880
there's even more that's really nefarious about this settlement as well.

01:23:06.880 --> 01:23:10.520
And that has to do with the distribution of the settlement funds.

01:23:10.720 --> 01:23:13.120
So, again, I'll read this verbatim.

01:23:13.320 --> 01:23:15.080
If any of the settlement fund remains

01:23:15.280 --> 01:23:19.040
undistributed after exhausting the efforts to locate the eligible claimants

01:23:19.080 --> 01:23:25.400
set forth, the excess funds will be distributed between Cyprus Fund for

01:23:25.400 --> 01:23:29.440
distribution to charitable organizations whose missions involved advancing women

01:23:29.640 --> 01:23:33.640
in the video game and technology industries or promoting awareness around

01:23:33.840 --> 01:23:38.480
sexual harassment, gender equality issues, and the diversity and inclusion fund to

01:23:38.680 --> 01:23:42.760
be used by the defendants exclusively for diversity, inclusion and

01:23:42.960 --> 01:23:47.120
equity efforts beyond the scope in terms of this the decree.

01:23:47.320 --> 01:23:51.560
The allocation between Cyprus Fund and diversity and inclusion fund will be

01:23:51.760 --> 01:23:56.160
decided by the defendants, but subject to approval by EEOC.

01:23:56.360 --> 01:23:58.320
So basically,

01:23:58.520 --> 01:24:05.080
Activision Blizzard could use this money for other things that they would, quote,

01:24:05.280 --> 01:24:07.600
say it goes into.

01:24:07.800 --> 01:24:12.920
Improving diversity, but might not necessarily do it.

01:24:13.920 --> 01:24:15.320
And they're willing.

01:24:15.520 --> 01:24:17.960
There's a lot of failure into that.

01:24:18.160 --> 01:24:20.840
Yeah, exactly.

01:24:21.040 --> 01:24:23.000
And they are, again,

01:24:23.200 --> 01:24:28.880
limiting any sort of information to be disclosed about their liability in any of

01:24:29.080 --> 01:24:34.320
this and it seems innocent to me.

01:24:34.520 --> 01:24:38.200
It's absolutely nefarious.

01:24:38.400 --> 01:24:41.480
And this intervention, I mean, they've done this before.

01:24:41.520 --> 01:24:43.720
They did it with Riot Games.

01:24:45.560 --> 01:24:48.040
And this probably happened last time.

01:24:49.240 --> 01:24:51.680
Yeah, this is.

01:24:51.880 --> 01:24:53.400
We need to keep our eyes on this.

01:24:53.400 --> 01:24:56.560
We need to pay attention to the precedent, something like this sets.

01:24:56.760 --> 01:25:02.080
And honestly enough, it's why the whole settlement business.

01:25:02.280 --> 01:25:04.640
Is disgusting.

01:25:04.840 --> 01:25:07.160
It absolutely is disgusting.

01:25:07.360 --> 01:25:10.040
All right, I got nothing to add, except this

01:25:10.080 --> 01:25:13.640
news story is just going to continue to be in the news every week.

01:25:13.840 --> 01:25:18.280
So settlements mean people with money can walk away.

01:25:18.480 --> 01:25:21.640
With no damage, pretty much.

01:25:21.840 --> 01:25:24.960
All right, let's move on, Loki.

01:25:25.160 --> 01:25:29.680
Yeah, so we're talking about how Sony is

01:25:29.880 --> 01:25:34.680
planning on discontinuing these stores for the Vita and PlayStation three.

01:25:34.880 --> 01:25:38.840
Well, right now they're planning on removing credit card and PayPal support

01:25:38.840 --> 01:25:43.800
from both stores in late October, so essentially kneecapping them.

01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:48.160
I guess you can still have those stores open to redownload software that you've

01:25:48.360 --> 01:25:52.400
already purchased, but you're going to be unable to make any more purchases

01:25:52.600 --> 01:25:55.640
starting October twenty seven.

01:25:55.840 --> 01:25:57.240
So.

01:25:58.360 --> 01:26:02.720
This is this is them trying to phase those things out again, but now they're just

01:26:02.920 --> 01:26:07.360
no, I saw the purchase thing, but I saw a legit thing about like how

01:26:07.400 --> 01:26:10.240
the credit card fees and stuff, they probably just don't want to be paying for

01:26:10.240 --> 01:26:14.440
those anymore, there's probably there as much as the Internet was pissed off when

01:26:14.440 --> 01:26:18.320
Sony threatened to pull these things the first time, I'm pretty sure the reality is

01:26:18.520 --> 01:26:23.080
these stores are not being used very much by the credit card fees.

01:26:23.080 --> 01:26:24.880
You'd only get paid by transaction.

01:26:24.880 --> 01:26:26.320
I can't imagine that it would be more

01:26:26.520 --> 01:26:30.000
expensive on this storefront versus like their current storefront.

01:26:30.200 --> 01:26:32.800
I think it's more of just like.

01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:34.760
They want to drive people towards newer

01:26:34.800 --> 01:26:39.520
software, and so they're probably just going to shut this down so people spend

01:26:39.720 --> 01:26:44.440
their hard earned money on those seventy dollar Sony games instead of, you know.

01:26:44.640 --> 01:26:47.600
The original, especially when we were talking about like remasters and remakes,

01:26:47.800 --> 01:26:52.280
you know, hey, buy the original for 20 bucks instead of 70 or something like that.

01:26:52.480 --> 01:26:56.280
And several folks in chat are saying you can still add money.

01:26:56.280 --> 01:26:57.680
You just can't do it directly.

01:26:57.880 --> 01:27:04.440
Yes, yes. But do I sort of also can tell this is the first step in where

01:27:04.480 --> 01:27:07.960
Sony has already shown they would like to be.

01:27:08.160 --> 01:27:09.880
But on one hand, I do get it.

01:27:09.880 --> 01:27:13.360
You know, I think for the direct, you know, whatever they built into the system

01:27:13.360 --> 01:27:15.960
and so forth, they probably just don't want to be paying for it anymore.

01:27:16.160 --> 01:27:18.040
But it isn't worth it to them.

01:27:18.240 --> 01:27:21.160
And there's a part of me that does get that.

01:27:21.360 --> 01:27:25.120
And like you guys are saying, you can still get money on there.

01:27:25.320 --> 01:27:29.840
It's not going to be as easy, but you can do it.

01:27:30.040 --> 01:27:32.520
So it's not like they're gone.

01:27:32.680 --> 01:27:36.080
So, yeah, yeah. All right.

01:27:36.280 --> 01:27:38.280
Moving on to our next story.

01:27:38.480 --> 01:27:40.560
Kotaku ran a report this week talking

01:27:40.760 --> 01:27:44.480
about how Metroid Dread is already running on switch emulators.

01:27:44.680 --> 01:27:47.960
And in the report, Kotaku has talked about how the game is

01:27:48.160 --> 01:27:52.600
fully playable in various 4K Nintendo switch emulators.

01:27:52.800 --> 01:27:55.680
They reference a couple of emulators in the story.

01:27:55.680 --> 01:27:58.400
They talk about Yuzu, which is an open source emulator.

01:27:58.600 --> 01:28:00.640
They talk about Ryujinx, which is another

01:28:00.640 --> 01:28:02.920
one that both of these can play the game.

01:28:03.120 --> 01:28:08.840
You can see some YouTubes of this in action because it plays the game at 4K.

01:28:09.040 --> 01:28:10.720
Kotaku is getting a lot of shit for running

01:28:10.920 --> 01:28:14.440
this article from folks on the Twitters and on social media.

01:28:14.640 --> 01:28:17.600
And I think a lot of people are very upset because

01:28:17.800 --> 01:28:21.040
Kotaku is talking about piracy

01:28:21.240 --> 01:28:25.080
only a couple of days after the game came out, I guess.

01:28:25.280 --> 01:28:26.520
Here's the thing, though, I don't get it.

01:28:26.720 --> 01:28:29.840
I think that outrage is kind of misplaced.

01:28:30.040 --> 01:28:33.080
Like, I can I'll meet you halfway.

01:28:33.280 --> 01:28:35.840
I'll meet you to the point part way, maybe not even halfway.

01:28:35.840 --> 01:28:36.720
I'll meet you part way.

01:28:36.920 --> 01:28:39.760
I understand maybe Kotaku didn't firmly

01:28:39.960 --> 01:28:45.880
enough say, hey, downloading software illegally is wrong.

01:28:46.080 --> 01:28:49.760
But they also didn't link to the ROMs, they linked to the emulators.

01:28:49.960 --> 01:28:53.840
And now all of you that are mad about it and posting about it.

01:28:54.040 --> 01:28:55.760
It's just the Streisand effect.

01:28:55.960 --> 01:28:58.120
Now you're spreading this more openly

01:28:58.120 --> 01:29:01.280
that the game is emulatable in these emulators.

01:29:01.480 --> 01:29:02.320
Here's the thing.

01:29:02.520 --> 01:29:05.960
Here's why I think Kotaku as a gaming,

01:29:06.160 --> 01:29:09.120
I cannot believe how fucking full circle we've come.

01:29:09.320 --> 01:29:11.600
Here I am about to defend this website.

01:29:11.800 --> 01:29:13.640
Look, y'all note the date and time.

01:29:13.840 --> 01:29:16.640
Here I am about to defend this website.

01:29:16.840 --> 01:29:18.320
My how far we've come.

01:29:18.520 --> 01:29:21.360
However, be that as it may.

01:29:21.560 --> 01:29:25.120
They're making a point is that right now,

01:29:25.160 --> 01:29:27.560
only like two, three days after release,

01:29:27.760 --> 01:29:34.720
this game is running better on these emulators than it does on the hardware.

01:29:34.920 --> 01:29:36.440
So there's point number one.

01:29:36.640 --> 01:29:40.720
And I think that is a newsworthy point, whether you like it or not.

01:29:40.920 --> 01:29:45.400
Because technically, you're not supposed to use these emulators if you don't have

01:29:45.400 --> 01:29:48.760
the software and the way to get the card to read on your computer and all this stuff.

01:29:48.960 --> 01:29:51.200
Yes, I know who really does that.

01:29:51.400 --> 01:29:54.880
I know, but that's the way these emulators are supposed to run that,

01:29:54.880 --> 01:29:59.840
because I have the game, so it would be fun, though, to check it out on like a 4K

01:30:00.040 --> 01:30:04.520
console or like on a PC and the one I saw them rain in 4K.

01:30:04.720 --> 01:30:09.080
It's just right now, GTX 1060, like my son's laptop is less

01:30:09.280 --> 01:30:12.600
respect than mine can run it like 60 FPS.

01:30:12.800 --> 01:30:17.960
So my like, dang, I can run that at, you know, 4K or something like that.

01:30:18.160 --> 01:30:19.640
That'd be awesome.

01:30:19.840 --> 01:30:23.800
And I should be able to do that because I own the software.

01:30:24.280 --> 01:30:26.600
Here's the other

01:30:26.800 --> 01:30:29.360
interesting thing about the article.

01:30:29.560 --> 01:30:33.280
I want to read this part verbatim because I thought this is where they really made

01:30:33.480 --> 01:30:37.200
this is where they made their point, in my opinion.

01:30:37.400 --> 01:30:39.720
Thanks to Nintendo's rather poor approach

01:30:39.920 --> 01:30:43.960
to supporting older games, especially those on the Game Boy Advance and DS,

01:30:44.160 --> 01:30:48.240
emulation is often the only viable means to play through their collection.

01:30:48.440 --> 01:30:51.600
And this is the case for much of the Metroid franchise.

01:30:51.800 --> 01:30:53.440
There are so many good reasons to be

01:30:53.640 --> 01:30:56.240
grateful for pirates, emulators, modders and hackers.

01:30:56.440 --> 01:30:59.080
They they may have overeaten at the buffet

01:30:59.080 --> 01:31:00.720
with that the way that sentence is structured.

01:31:00.920 --> 01:31:03.000
But let's let's focus on the point

01:31:03.200 --> 01:31:07.920
for doing what so many big publishers won't keeping old games alive.

01:31:08.120 --> 01:31:11.240
Clearly, that's not the case for Metroid Dread, a brand new game.

01:31:11.440 --> 01:31:13.600
But this is an enormous issue Nintendo has

01:31:13.800 --> 01:31:18.880
to face given the relative technical inferiority of its current console.

01:31:19.080 --> 01:31:22.520
Now, although I think they overate on the sentence where they said,

01:31:22.520 --> 01:31:26.360
be grateful for pirates, I think that might have been a little bit oof.

01:31:26.560 --> 01:31:28.200
Everything else they said in those two

01:31:28.400 --> 01:31:32.400
paragraphs kind of does a very appropriate dragging of Nintendo.

01:31:32.600 --> 01:31:35.680
And the fact that, yeah, you you know,

01:31:35.880 --> 01:31:40.880
everybody's bellyaching for Super Mario RPG to hit the Switch console.

01:31:41.080 --> 01:31:43.320
So how are you all playing that game right now?

01:31:43.400 --> 01:31:45.280
How do you know this game is so great?

01:31:45.480 --> 01:31:47.800
Do you still have a dusty Super Nintendo?

01:31:48.360 --> 01:31:49.480
SNES classic.

01:31:49.680 --> 01:31:54.560
No, but so I would say, though, they should be thanking the emulator

01:31:54.760 --> 01:31:57.920
developers, because that's, I think, a lot of work that

01:31:58.120 --> 01:32:00.280
those people should be thankful for them.

01:32:00.480 --> 01:32:06.320
The piracy, not so much, but, you know, means to an end, I guess so.

01:32:06.520 --> 01:32:07.720
I think it's interesting.

01:32:07.720 --> 01:32:09.800
I think it raises an interesting discussion.

01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:13.720
Nintendo, a company that is very sluggish in

01:32:13.840 --> 01:32:18.240
letting you access its back catalog, now has one of its current catalog games

01:32:18.440 --> 01:32:22.000
running at a pretty at a technical specification that's

01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:25.880
better than what the console provides, you know, like be funny in it.

01:32:25.880 --> 01:32:27.880
And I'm going to tell you, I'm calling it right now.

01:32:28.080 --> 01:32:29.680
I'm calling it. You're going to see these articles.

01:32:29.880 --> 01:32:31.040
Get ready.

01:32:31.240 --> 01:32:35.120
You're going to see the handheld steam system

01:32:35.320 --> 01:32:39.760
running these games and for, you know, and in a higher resolution or at least

01:32:39.760 --> 01:32:42.400
better quality than actually, you know, it's the 720p screen.

01:32:42.560 --> 01:32:45.760
OK, not higher resolution quality, but at least you're going to have

01:32:45.960 --> 01:32:50.400
better graphic fidelity than, say, a Nintendo Switch.

01:32:50.600 --> 01:32:53.160
Or at least you'll be able to plug it into something or something like that.

01:32:53.360 --> 01:32:58.480
But they'll do the comparison between the Steam handheld console and

01:32:58.680 --> 01:33:01.720
the Nintendo Switch once it comes out.

01:33:01.920 --> 01:33:05.640
All this being said, I want to stress, unlike the Kotaku article,

01:33:05.840 --> 01:33:09.120
I do want to stress, buy Metroid Dread if you have an interest in it.

01:33:09.120 --> 01:33:10.080
It's a good game.

01:33:10.120 --> 01:33:11.560
And Nintendo and the team that made

01:33:11.760 --> 01:33:14.640
that game did earn your money for that purchase.

01:33:14.640 --> 01:33:16.040
So you should go buy this game.

01:33:16.240 --> 01:33:19.760
If you are using these emulators just to pirate things and play things for free.

01:33:19.960 --> 01:33:22.240
Well, then.

01:33:22.440 --> 01:33:26.120
You are the bad people that Twitter is trying to drag right now.

01:33:26.320 --> 01:33:30.600
OK, so but yeah, so so buy the game.

01:33:30.800 --> 01:33:34.880
But I think this side of things where, you know, what's interesting,

01:33:34.880 --> 01:33:39.000
not just Kotaku ran this article, but PC Gamer ran a very similar thing.

01:33:39.120 --> 01:33:43.680
Why would PC Gamer run an article about the Nintendo Switch?

01:33:43.880 --> 01:33:47.240
Because it's just very non PC, that's right, this is all running on a PC,

01:33:47.440 --> 01:33:50.640
so it's just very interesting how that all is coming together.

01:33:50.840 --> 01:33:52.080
All right. Anyway,

01:33:52.280 --> 01:33:55.600
let the other thing, the two I see that's more exciting and it's not necessarily

01:33:55.800 --> 01:33:59.400
talked about yet is all of the modifications that can be

01:33:59.600 --> 01:34:02.360
done to some of these games in an emulator environment.

01:34:02.360 --> 01:34:04.640
So like, you know, all the crazy stuff you see with,

01:34:04.840 --> 01:34:07.080
you know, Breath of the Wild and stuff like that.

01:34:07.280 --> 01:34:09.400
That's, I think, more exciting.

01:34:09.600 --> 01:34:15.080
Hell, if people are very dedicated enough, we could put Waluigi in Smash.

01:34:15.280 --> 01:34:19.120
It could be a reality because they've done similar things to Melee.

01:34:19.320 --> 01:34:21.680
I'm thinking more along the lines of that

01:34:21.880 --> 01:34:24.440
accessibility issue I called out early in the show.

01:34:24.640 --> 01:34:28.040
You make a good point that could be fixed through this.

01:34:28.240 --> 01:34:31.040
That's a very interesting point to ponder.

01:34:31.240 --> 01:34:32.440
All right.

01:34:32.600 --> 01:34:34.920
Is that maybe, maybe

01:34:35.120 --> 01:34:38.680
that's the only way somebody can actually play this game is through an emulator.

01:34:38.880 --> 01:34:41.800
Now, again, you need to pay the sixty dollars,

01:34:41.800 --> 01:34:45.120
have the cartridge and run the emulator the way that it's supposed to be run.

01:34:45.320 --> 01:34:48.360
But it's a very interesting prospect.

01:34:48.560 --> 01:34:50.360
All right, moving on.

01:34:50.560 --> 01:34:52.440
Let's let's talk more about games that we

01:34:52.640 --> 01:34:58.000
emulate as we take a trip down memory lane in our next segment.

01:35:02.440 --> 01:35:03.440
And

01:35:08.600 --> 01:35:13.600
now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and

01:35:13.800 --> 01:35:16.040
pull out a classic and tell you about it.

01:35:16.240 --> 01:35:20.240
It's time for the classic game of the week.

01:35:20.440 --> 01:35:23.040
It's a good one tonight, DarkSakura. What did you pick?

01:35:23.240 --> 01:35:25.400
I picked System Shock,

01:35:26.400 --> 01:35:32.960
which is a really groundbreaking game, I believe, you know.

01:35:33.160 --> 01:35:37.080
System Shock was released on September twenty third, nineteen ninety four.

01:35:37.280 --> 01:35:39.720
I was in college

01:35:39.920 --> 01:35:44.520
and it is a first person action adventure game that was developed

01:35:44.720 --> 01:35:48.920
by Looking Glass Technologies, published by Origin Systems.

01:35:49.120 --> 01:35:53.760
It is a space station cyberpunk game set

01:35:53.960 --> 01:35:55.840
in twenty seventy two.

01:35:56.040 --> 01:36:01.280
You play a security hacker, an unnamed, you know, person,

01:36:01.480 --> 01:36:11.320
and you are trying to stop a AI called Shodan, S-H-O-D-A-N.

01:36:11.520 --> 01:36:17.640
But it's the big thing about System Shock is that its 3D engine was really,

01:36:17.840 --> 01:36:19.840
really

01:36:20.600 --> 01:36:25.720
new and for the time, really innovative.

01:36:25.920 --> 01:36:29.560
The physics to it, the gameplay,

01:36:29.760 --> 01:36:35.720
it was really some of the most influential to be done at its time.

01:36:35.920 --> 01:36:40.440
And in fact, the the developers actually sort of moved

01:36:40.640 --> 01:36:46.680
from their previous games to push their own envelope with System Shock.

01:36:46.880 --> 01:36:48.720
They had also done Ultima Underworld,

01:36:48.920 --> 01:36:53.320
the Stygian Abyss and Ultima Underworld 2 Labyrinth of Worlds,

01:36:53.520 --> 01:36:56.800
and they wanted to streamline what they had done to that game,

01:36:57.000 --> 01:37:02.080
those games to make things more integrated, to make them work better together.

01:37:02.280 --> 01:37:05.400
It was a real breakthrough at the time.

01:37:06.600 --> 01:37:11.280
It was, I would say, moderately successful when it came out,

01:37:11.480 --> 01:37:14.440
but Looking Glass did lose money on the project.

01:37:14.640 --> 01:37:16.480
However,

01:37:16.680 --> 01:37:23.200
they did proceed with a sequel and a tertiary release.

01:37:23.400 --> 01:37:27.240
And there it actually had some

01:37:27.440 --> 01:37:32.160
spiritual successors, including Deus Ex that came out in 2000,

01:37:32.360 --> 01:37:37.680
which was produced and directed by Warren Spector, who was

01:37:37.880 --> 01:37:40.400
the producer for System Shock.

01:37:40.600 --> 01:37:43.040
And then, of course, Bioshock is also

01:37:43.240 --> 01:37:47.280
considered a spiritual successor to both of the games.

01:37:47.480 --> 01:37:51.920
There's actually going to be a remake of System Shock supposedly coming out

01:37:52.120 --> 01:37:57.720
in this year or is it already out, I don't know, by Nightdive Studios.

01:37:57.920 --> 01:38:00.240
At any rate, you play the game first person.

01:38:00.440 --> 01:38:02.920
Like I said, you're in a 3D environment.

01:38:03.120 --> 01:38:06.760
You have this multi-level space station that you can explore.

01:38:06.960 --> 01:38:08.880
You have enemies, you have puzzles.

01:38:08.920 --> 01:38:12.360
It's non-linear, mostly,

01:38:12.560 --> 01:38:16.800
that will allow emergent gameplay.

01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:20.160
You can freely move your cursor around to aim objects.

01:38:20.360 --> 01:38:22.520
It is a PC game, by the way.

01:38:22.720 --> 01:38:26.280
You can crouch, you can look up, you can crawl.

01:38:26.480 --> 01:38:28.200
You've got all kinds of different things.

01:38:28.400 --> 01:38:34.120
And your HUD has three different multifunction displays

01:38:34.320 --> 01:38:36.560
that you can configure for different information.

01:38:36.560 --> 01:38:38.440
You have an automap, you have your inventory.

01:38:38.920 --> 01:38:41.480
Layouts, weapon readouts, you name it.

01:38:41.680 --> 01:38:48.040
So you advance the plot by getting log disks and getting your emails.

01:38:48.240 --> 01:38:52.320
There are no NPCs really in the game,

01:38:52.520 --> 01:38:57.280
but you do also have the AI in the game

01:38:57.480 --> 01:39:03.160
that traps and blocks pathways and you get certain information to keep going through.

01:39:03.360 --> 01:39:06.480
You also have this sort of cyberspace

01:39:06.520 --> 01:39:10.920
that you can go through where you move weightlessly through these

01:39:11.120 --> 01:39:13.520
wireframe 3D environments that you can use

01:39:13.720 --> 01:39:17.720
to collect data to fight the security programs by Shodan.

01:39:17.920 --> 01:39:20.240
It's just really immersive.

01:39:20.440 --> 01:39:25.160
And then you also get through different weapons and different tools.

01:39:25.360 --> 01:39:30.280
You'll get a dart pistol, you'll get concussion grenades, land mines,

01:39:30.480 --> 01:39:34.400
and you also get dermal patches and first aid kits to heal yourself.

01:39:34.400 --> 01:39:36.880
You get hardware like energy shields

01:39:37.080 --> 01:39:41.640
and head-mounted lanterns and different things like that.

01:39:43.360 --> 01:39:46.160
And so basically,

01:39:47.040 --> 01:39:51.520
the hacker is the hero.

01:39:51.720 --> 01:39:55.760
So into the design with this game,

01:39:55.960 --> 01:40:02.080
it was first conceived during the end of the development for Ultima Underworld 2.

01:40:02.280 --> 01:40:05.720
So around December 92, January 93,

01:40:05.920 --> 01:40:11.920
the programmer designer, Doug Church, was

01:40:12.120 --> 01:40:17.080
at the Texas headquarters of Origin Systems and working with Looking Glass

01:40:17.280 --> 01:40:22.280
Technologies for their next project. And so they kind of put this together,

01:40:22.480 --> 01:40:29.480
wanted it to be an immersive simulation game, but in a fantasy setting.

01:40:29.480 --> 01:40:33.680
And then they went for the more cyberpunk,

01:40:33.880 --> 01:40:39.160
kind of almost wanting to make this a spin off of Wing Commander, but not quite.

01:40:39.360 --> 01:40:43.360
And so they just put things together.

01:40:43.560 --> 01:40:45.960
They evolved.

01:40:46.160 --> 01:40:50.600
They really put things together and out came this.

01:40:50.800 --> 01:40:52.920
So with its production,

01:40:53.120 --> 01:40:58.360
it did require a new engine that could do true 3D graphics.

01:40:58.440 --> 01:41:03.920
They just chucked the Ultima engine and coded one from scratch.

01:41:04.120 --> 01:41:09.200
They used Wacom C++ and 32-bit code.

01:41:09.400 --> 01:41:11.840
Their new engine could process texture mapping.

01:41:12.040 --> 01:41:15.200
It could use sloped architecture, light emitting objects.

01:41:15.400 --> 01:41:18.000
You could look in any direction.

01:41:18.200 --> 01:41:21.520
It allowed for improved player physics,

01:41:21.720 --> 01:41:27.520
including the jumping, crawling, climbing mechanics.

01:41:27.760 --> 01:41:31.040
They found limitations in their engine

01:41:31.240 --> 01:41:34.640
so that they could push the envelope for what it was able to do.

01:41:34.840 --> 01:41:36.840
They did have 3D character models

01:41:36.840 --> 01:41:39.600
enabled, but they couldn't implement it on their schedule.

01:41:39.800 --> 01:41:41.600
They had triggered events.

01:41:41.800 --> 01:41:44.520
It was really something major for its day.

01:41:44.720 --> 01:41:49.000
The wireframe mechanics were actually, I thought, a really good touch for sort of

01:41:49.200 --> 01:41:56.200
that floating feeling that you were moving through a virtual space.

01:41:56.200 --> 01:42:00.080
So the first release of this came out

01:42:00.280 --> 01:42:03.600
on floppy disks and had no support for spoken dialog.

01:42:03.800 --> 01:42:07.080
Later on, that was September 1994.

01:42:07.280 --> 01:42:11.800
A CD-ROM version was released in December 1994 that had full speech

01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:15.480
for the logs and the emails, the multiple display resolutions,

01:42:15.680 --> 01:42:22.200
more detailed graphics, and of course, it is considered to be the superior version.

01:42:22.880 --> 01:42:29.040
So they wanted to

01:42:29.240 --> 01:42:33.600
to actually do these sort of audio vignettes that they

01:42:33.800 --> 01:42:37.160
and they really didn't want to do the floppy version.

01:42:37.360 --> 01:42:41.120
They just wanted the CD one to go out, but

01:42:41.320 --> 01:42:44.520
they had to get something out for release in September.

01:42:44.720 --> 01:42:46.880
So that's why it came out with that.

01:42:47.080 --> 01:42:50.720
It sold over 170,000 copies.

01:42:51.720 --> 01:42:57.320
It was successful, but not enough to keep looking glass afloat as a company

01:42:57.520 --> 01:43:02.480
because it had another competitor, Doom.

01:43:02.680 --> 01:43:06.080
And we know what Doom did,

01:43:06.280 --> 01:43:09.080
but it got a lot of praise for how

01:43:09.280 --> 01:43:13.240
technologically advanced it was and how much more complex it was,

01:43:13.440 --> 01:43:15.720
complicated and complex it was than Doom.

01:43:15.920 --> 01:43:19.200
And it was considered to be worth the time

01:43:19.240 --> 01:43:23.720
it took to play the game, to explore it, to go.

01:43:23.920 --> 01:43:25.520
And there's people because, you know,

01:43:25.520 --> 01:43:29.200
when you release a sort of game at the same time and the other popular,

01:43:29.400 --> 01:43:32.800
people will try to find the similarities between them.

01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:37.520
But this was

01:43:37.720 --> 01:43:39.880
more elaborate, more complicated.

01:43:40.080 --> 01:43:43.880
And even some of the some of the reviewers out there said you have to read

01:43:43.880 --> 01:43:47.040
the manual before you can actually get into the game and that it had a higher

01:43:47.240 --> 01:43:50.560
system requirement with, of course, all those complex controls.

01:43:50.560 --> 01:43:54.920
For me, I would even more put this a little bit more into the realm of dissent

01:43:55.120 --> 01:44:01.320
for, you know, later on for things that kind of had that complication.

01:44:01.520 --> 01:44:04.320
It blended strategy with action.

01:44:04.320 --> 01:44:05.920
You couldn't just go run and gun it.

01:44:06.120 --> 01:44:07.680
You had to think about playing it.

01:44:07.880 --> 01:44:13.480
You know, it was a it was a thinking game.

01:44:13.680 --> 01:44:15.560
Um.

01:44:15.760 --> 01:44:18.080
I'll just say it's interesting that you

01:44:18.280 --> 01:44:22.560
bring up that Doom comparison, because my memory goes, oh,

01:44:22.560 --> 01:44:25.880
this was one of those many games that came out because it was, you know,

01:44:25.880 --> 01:44:29.440
inspired by Doom and everything that was happening in the 3D genre at that time.

01:44:29.440 --> 01:44:32.440
It's interesting the tricks that our memory will play on us.

01:44:32.640 --> 01:44:35.520
But you're you're probably very right in that, you know,

01:44:35.520 --> 01:44:38.440
Doom was something you just, you know, run and gun, pick it up.

01:44:38.440 --> 01:44:39.480
There were contemporaries.

01:44:39.680 --> 01:44:44.120
There was there was much more thinking in this game that maybe made it harder

01:44:44.160 --> 01:44:46.480
to just and that doesn't make it worse or anything.

01:44:46.680 --> 01:44:48.480
It just made it a little harder to get into.

01:44:48.680 --> 01:44:54.680
And I think maybe that's why our brains don't equate this from of the exact same

01:44:54.680 --> 01:44:57.480
era and not one inspired by the other necessarily.

01:44:57.680 --> 01:45:00.280
Well, and it was also a lot more graphically complex.

01:45:00.480 --> 01:45:03.000
I mean, it was the.

01:45:03.200 --> 01:45:07.560
If you look at it, the specification graphic wise, story wise,

01:45:07.760 --> 01:45:09.040
it's the superior game.

01:45:09.240 --> 01:45:10.080
Yeah.

01:45:10.240 --> 01:45:16.560
And it really did set a lot of things that we take for granted in our games today,

01:45:16.760 --> 01:45:19.640
like immersive simulation,

01:45:19.840 --> 01:45:25.640
the whole emergent gameplay style where as you go, you learn more and new things happen.

01:45:25.840 --> 01:45:28.880
And I mean, and again, without this, we wouldn't have Bioshock.

01:45:29.080 --> 01:45:30.240
We wouldn't have Deus Ex.

01:45:30.440 --> 01:45:33.600
We wouldn't have Thief, you know.

01:45:33.800 --> 01:45:35.920
Of course, there was a sequel.

01:45:36.080 --> 01:45:40.960
System Shock 2 came out by Looking Glass and Irrational Games in 1999.

01:45:41.160 --> 01:45:44.240
It really played a lot more on that one.

01:45:44.240 --> 01:45:46.000
And then, of course, Looking Glass closed

01:45:46.200 --> 01:45:49.600
and the rights fell to the Meadowbrook Insurance Group,

01:45:49.800 --> 01:45:53.120
which is a subsidiary of Star Insurance Company.

01:45:53.320 --> 01:45:56.920
And it was then acquired by Nightdive Studios

01:45:57.120 --> 01:46:01.760
and they distributed the game and the rights for System Shock at all.

01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:06.200
And they had a plan to release the source code,

01:46:06.400 --> 01:46:11.080
but they did a third game in 2015 called System Shock 3.

01:46:11.280 --> 01:46:12.160
Sorry, I take that back.

01:46:12.360 --> 01:46:16.400
That was developed by Otherside Entertainment.

01:46:17.280 --> 01:46:23.400
And yeah, there's it was not as well received as any of the others.

01:46:23.600 --> 01:46:27.680
So Nightdive Studios, being that they own the rights to System Shock are planning

01:46:27.680 --> 01:46:33.480
on doing well, they did System Shock Enhanced Edition that came out

01:46:33.680 --> 01:46:39.800
on GOG on September 22nd, 2015 for Windows.

01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:42.120
The version

01:46:42.320 --> 01:46:47.440
needed definitely some more improvements to boost up the resolution.

01:46:47.640 --> 01:46:52.120
It also does include the original version of the game, which is System Shock Classic

01:46:52.320 --> 01:46:57.880
with support for Windows OS X and Linux, Mac OS X.

01:46:58.080 --> 01:47:00.480
It received really positive reviews,

01:47:00.680 --> 01:47:06.080
but Nightdive Studios wants to do a reimagining of System Shock to come out

01:47:06.280 --> 01:47:12.920
for Windows, Xbox One and PlayStation 4 using Unreal Engine 4.

01:47:13.120 --> 01:47:14.440
But

01:47:14.640 --> 01:47:17.760
there's not really, I think, a whole lot else about that.

01:47:17.800 --> 01:47:20.160
But Otherside Entertainment also wants

01:47:20.360 --> 01:47:24.040
to acquire the license to System Shock

01:47:24.240 --> 01:47:29.040
to improve on System Shock 3 to redevelop it.

01:47:29.240 --> 01:47:35.760
But the Mac version source code was released by Nightdive Studios on GitHub.

01:47:35.960 --> 01:47:39.640
And there is also

01:47:40.360 --> 01:47:42.200
a

01:47:42.400 --> 01:47:46.200
after a month of development, there's a cross platform source port called

01:47:46.360 --> 01:47:48.080
Shocklet

01:47:48.280 --> 01:47:51.400
that has been released for developers.

01:47:51.600 --> 01:47:55.000
So there we go. That is the state of the System Shock.

01:47:55.200 --> 01:47:56.240
Good pick, Dark Sakura.

01:47:56.240 --> 01:47:59.840
This is one that, you know, I knew of this game and I think I even may have played

01:47:59.840 --> 01:48:02.440
it a little bit, but I think it was one of those games I was probably pretty easily

01:48:02.440 --> 01:48:05.520
overwhelmed with because, yeah, that would have been right around the time, too.

01:48:05.520 --> 01:48:08.080
It would have been like either early college or late high school for me.

01:48:08.280 --> 01:48:10.200
And I probably blew this game off pretty quickly.

01:48:10.400 --> 01:48:12.880
But it is very interesting how much this

01:48:12.880 --> 01:48:16.320
was brought to the table that wasn't on the table yet,

01:48:16.520 --> 01:48:21.320
but then kind of became a part of it much later on, if that makes sense.

01:48:21.520 --> 01:48:23.160
So, no, indeed. All right.

01:48:23.360 --> 01:48:27.160
Well, there it is. Classic game of the week is System Shock.

01:48:27.360 --> 01:48:32.920
All right. Let's get to our next segment and some rapid fire news.

01:48:33.120 --> 01:48:35.560
Just real quick, housekeeping note.

01:48:35.760 --> 01:48:40.240
We will be here next week and next week will be episode number 888,

01:48:40.360 --> 01:48:42.760
which is a bit of a lucky number there, so that'll be fun.

01:48:42.960 --> 01:48:44.520
So we will be here next week.

01:48:44.720 --> 01:48:49.680
We will not be here in two weeks live as I will be out.

01:48:49.680 --> 01:48:53.600
I'm going to actually be at Disneyland in two weeks, so I can't wait.

01:48:53.800 --> 01:48:55.600
And then three weeks is Halloween.

01:48:55.600 --> 01:48:57.080
So we're still trying to work out the plan.

01:48:57.280 --> 01:49:02.920
I think I will be on Twitch that night one way or another because I don't do anything.

01:49:03.120 --> 01:49:04.840
I mean, I do things for Halloween.

01:49:04.840 --> 01:49:06.840
I'm actually hosting two shows that weekend.

01:49:07.040 --> 01:49:08.440
So shout out for local folks.

01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:12.240
Well, Rocky Horror is almost sold out now, but I think there's like 10 seats left.

01:49:12.440 --> 01:49:14.320
If you want to try and get a general mission ticket

01:49:14.520 --> 01:49:17.440
at the Colonial on that Saturday, the 30th.

01:49:17.640 --> 01:49:19.280
So I have plans Friday.

01:49:19.480 --> 01:49:22.800
I'm hosting another show, a burlesque variety show that Friday night.

01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:24.520
Then I'm hosting Rocky that Saturday.

01:49:24.520 --> 01:49:26.840
So it's weird to be talking about hosting shows again, but hooray.

01:49:27.040 --> 01:49:29.280
But then Sunday, I'm not doing anything on Halloween.

01:49:29.320 --> 01:49:32.160
So I will have gotten Halloween out of my system the other two nights.

01:49:32.160 --> 01:49:34.520
So I'll be here. But, Loki, I know you have kids and you

01:49:34.520 --> 01:49:38.200
might not be able to get out of the show that easy or get out of it to do the show that easy.

01:49:38.200 --> 01:49:40.280
I don't know where Jamie's at, so we'll see.

01:49:40.280 --> 01:49:43.840
I'll be here on Twitch one way or the other, but we'll see where my co-hosts are.

01:49:44.040 --> 01:49:45.240
So. All right.

01:49:45.440 --> 01:49:48.720
If we can't all be here together, we'll try to do a show throughout the week

01:49:48.920 --> 01:49:50.320
or something, so we have that.

01:49:50.520 --> 01:49:53.080
OK, um, rapid fire news.

01:49:53.080 --> 01:49:55.200
Now we can get into it. Loki.

01:49:56.840 --> 01:49:59.240
You're muted.

01:49:59.440 --> 01:50:00.800
I need I swear I hit the button.

01:50:00.800 --> 01:50:02.800
I know I need a big neon alert.

01:50:02.800 --> 01:50:04.600
All right. Oh, I didn't realize that there's a new

01:50:04.600 --> 01:50:07.600
Doctor Who premiering on ten thirty one, says Pod Culture.

01:50:07.800 --> 01:50:10.640
Oh, I now I see where you all got to be.

01:50:10.640 --> 01:50:13.120
All right, go ahead.

01:50:13.320 --> 01:50:17.960
So as we've been kind of getting rumors that this might be coming,

01:50:18.160 --> 01:50:25.680
we finally got an official announcement that, yes, the Grand Theft Auto trilogy

01:50:25.880 --> 01:50:28.800
was a definitive edition and, you know, there's a subtitle.

01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:34.520
Yeah, the definitive edition is going to be released later this year by Rockstar Games.

01:50:34.720 --> 01:50:36.160
Yes, Rockstar Games,

01:50:36.360 --> 01:50:41.760
the infamous company that likes to perpetuate the old Grand Theft Auto games

01:50:41.760 --> 01:50:43.760
and doesn't make new Grand Theft Auto games anymore.

01:50:43.960 --> 01:50:48.000
But they're going to have the old ones release again.

01:50:48.200 --> 01:50:49.360
And am I excited about it?

01:50:49.560 --> 01:50:57.040
No, because I already have Grand Theft Auto Vice City and three and San Andreas.

01:50:57.240 --> 01:51:01.440
But Loki, these are the definitive editions.

01:51:01.560 --> 01:51:02.960
You

01:51:03.240 --> 01:51:07.680
they will have done literally nothing to it, I'm sure.

01:51:07.880 --> 01:51:09.200
So that's the thing.

01:51:09.400 --> 01:51:12.400
Look forward to that, I guess, or something.

01:51:12.600 --> 01:51:18.400
And then to make things even more exciting, the Avengers game.

01:51:18.600 --> 01:51:20.560
You remember that game by Eidos?

01:51:20.760 --> 01:51:22.160
Well, I do.

01:51:22.360 --> 01:51:25.800
I was going to download it and then it was one hundred and ninety gigabytes to get

01:51:26.000 --> 01:51:30.160
that on Game Pass and I was like, so, yeah, go check it out if it's on Game Pass.

01:51:30.400 --> 01:51:33.920
But cloud games, I might try it through the cloud gaming thing.

01:51:34.120 --> 01:51:34.760
It's on there, too.

01:51:34.960 --> 01:51:37.320
So there was a thing that they had done.

01:51:37.320 --> 01:51:41.400
They did some tweaks to leveling in the game because they thought it was too easy

01:51:41.600 --> 01:51:46.240
to get to a higher level in the game, and so they had tweaked the leveling

01:51:46.440 --> 01:51:50.600
to make it harder to level up and people didn't like that.

01:51:50.800 --> 01:51:51.880
Like what? You know that.

01:51:52.080 --> 01:51:55.400
But they're like, well, it's maybe confusing,

01:51:55.600 --> 01:51:58.880
overwhelming to newer players that they're leveling too fast.

01:51:59.080 --> 01:52:00.880
Well, now

01:52:01.280 --> 01:52:05.440
apparently it comes out that, well, the reason why they probably did that is

01:52:05.640 --> 01:52:09.480
because they're selling XP boosts now so that you can level up faster.

01:52:09.680 --> 01:52:10.240
That's right.

01:52:10.440 --> 01:52:15.840
They're providing a solution at a cost to a problem that they created.

01:52:16.640 --> 01:52:21.880
That's your triple A capitalist game mentality.

01:52:22.080 --> 01:52:23.720
Another reason not to play this game.

01:52:23.920 --> 01:52:25.920
So, all right, we'll get to it.

01:52:26.120 --> 01:52:28.560
We'll get to Jamie's rapid fire news stories in just a moment.

01:52:28.560 --> 01:52:30.200
But first, I'm looking at chat for some

01:52:30.400 --> 01:52:32.640
comments over at Twitch.TV slash VOG Network.

01:52:32.840 --> 01:52:35.280
S.H.O. 100 Matt says GTA 6 is never going

01:52:35.280 --> 01:52:37.640
to live up to the hype whenever it when it ever comes out.

01:52:37.840 --> 01:52:38.680
Do you think that's the first?

01:52:38.880 --> 01:52:43.440
Do you think Grand Theft Auto 6 can possibly live up to this hype of many years?

01:52:43.640 --> 01:52:45.320
You do? Yes.

01:52:45.520 --> 01:52:48.120
Grand Theft Auto 5 lived up to the hype and 4 was amazing.

01:52:48.320 --> 01:52:49.800
So I don't see why not.

01:52:50.000 --> 01:52:51.960
Except for the multiplayer.

01:52:52.160 --> 01:52:57.200
Well, you know, the multiplayer in 5 is all it's just.

01:52:57.400 --> 01:53:00.000
I don't necessarily like the sandbox multiplayer.

01:53:00.200 --> 01:53:04.640
I liked how 4 had the option, like if you want the sandbox multiplayer,

01:53:04.840 --> 01:53:08.920
you can do that, or if you want it, you know, specific just levels or whatever

01:53:09.120 --> 01:53:11.360
to do like a deathmatch and you could do that.

01:53:11.560 --> 01:53:16.000
I liked how you had like options and they still kind of have that in this.

01:53:16.200 --> 01:53:18.280
But it's.

01:53:18.480 --> 01:53:25.280
It's clearly meant to force you to grind for money, and they clearly built it

01:53:25.280 --> 01:53:27.120
in a way to push those shark cards.

01:53:27.320 --> 01:53:29.680
And fortunately, based on the revenue

01:53:29.680 --> 01:53:32.160
that they're making with Grand Theft Auto Online, it's working.

01:53:32.360 --> 01:53:36.520
And so that's a problem is once you've given them such an easy source of cash,

01:53:36.720 --> 01:53:39.240
they're going to keep perpetuating that, unfortunately.

01:53:39.240 --> 01:53:40.880
And so they're not really motivated

01:53:41.080 --> 01:53:44.760
to make a new game until they've run this one dry.

01:53:44.960 --> 01:53:48.680
It's the Activision of the music game worlds or anything that they,

01:53:48.880 --> 01:53:54.240
you know, Activision touches Rockstar Games is kind of learning that lesson

01:53:54.440 --> 01:53:59.360
themselves where they are just going to milk this until they, you know, trillionaires.

01:53:59.560 --> 01:54:03.920
And so we will probably see a Grand Theft Auto six until Grand Theft Auto Online

01:54:04.120 --> 01:54:06.600
and Grand Theft Auto five's numbers drop.

01:54:06.800 --> 01:54:08.280
They're working on it, who knows?

01:54:08.480 --> 01:54:11.280
Before we get to Jamie stories, Tiger Claw on chat says, oh,

01:54:11.480 --> 01:54:13.760
you guys didn't mention about the trailer for Resident Evil.

01:54:13.960 --> 01:54:15.280
Welcome to Raccoon City.

01:54:15.480 --> 01:54:20.360
It's because I so rarely get into TV shows and Netflix movies and that stuff anymore.

01:54:20.960 --> 01:54:23.520
I full on meant I sat down

01:54:23.720 --> 01:54:28.160
on Friday night because I was very bored and I full on meant to start Squid Game

01:54:28.160 --> 01:54:30.080
because everybody's talking about Squid Games.

01:54:30.080 --> 01:54:31.120
I want to watch that.

01:54:31.120 --> 01:54:32.760
Everybody's been talking about it nonstop.

01:54:32.960 --> 01:54:34.800
But maybe we should watch it together, Jamie.

01:54:35.000 --> 01:54:36.600
Let's do it. Oh, my God.

01:54:36.800 --> 01:54:38.360
Let's have a live reaction.

01:54:38.560 --> 01:54:41.960
I don't I don't think we can do that because we can't show the show.

01:54:41.960 --> 01:54:43.360
We could just show ourselves. I don't know.

01:54:43.480 --> 01:54:45.200
Yeah, we'll show ourselves talking shit about it.

01:54:45.400 --> 01:54:47.520
But anyway, here's the thing.

01:54:47.560 --> 01:54:50.600
No, I meant to watch it, but then you know what happened?

01:54:50.800 --> 01:54:57.440
Instead, on my suggestion that Leah Remini escaping Scientology thing came up.

01:54:57.640 --> 01:55:01.520
I watched like four episodes of that in a night.

01:55:01.720 --> 01:55:03.960
It was compelling, God damn it.

01:55:04.160 --> 01:55:06.920
Anyway, it's so interesting.

01:55:07.120 --> 01:55:09.800
Anyway, let's see.

01:55:10.000 --> 01:55:11.240
Can I do my stuff now?

01:55:11.440 --> 01:55:13.080
Yes, you can do your stuff now.

01:55:13.240 --> 01:55:16.800
OK, so there is going to be an Animal

01:55:17.000 --> 01:55:23.400
Crossing direct scheduled on Brewster's birthday, or as he is known in

01:55:23.600 --> 01:55:27.760
in the Japanese version, Maestro, I believe it's either Maestro or Maestro.

01:55:27.960 --> 01:55:29.360
I'll have to look it up again.

01:55:29.560 --> 01:55:32.480
But anyway, it's going to be on the Nintendo YouTube

01:55:32.680 --> 01:55:37.040
channel on October 15th, and I finally have a reason to play the game again.

01:55:37.240 --> 01:55:39.000
Because Brewster.

01:55:39.200 --> 01:55:42.520
I have a Brewster plushie like somewhere behind me, so

01:55:42.720 --> 01:55:45.680
anyway, and you have a catch up.

01:55:45.880 --> 01:55:49.360
I do have a catch up, and I'm also very excited for this direct because I want

01:55:49.560 --> 01:55:54.480
reasons to go back and visit my town because I abandoned them about a year ago.

01:55:54.680 --> 01:56:01.680
Well, there is also a new addition to the arcade archives for Namco,

01:56:01.880 --> 01:56:07.840
the the Genji and Heike clan is joining in amongst those.

01:56:08.040 --> 01:56:10.240
So you will.

01:56:10.480 --> 01:56:15.480
And for anyone who doesn't know anything about the Genji and Heike clans,

01:56:15.680 --> 01:56:21.360
it actually is going back from like really old Japanese literature.

01:56:21.560 --> 01:56:25.240
So but it's it's a really honestly,

01:56:25.440 --> 01:56:30.480
it's a really beautiful game and I'm glad to see it in there.

01:56:30.680 --> 01:56:32.400
Yeah, it's interesting that this arcade

01:56:32.600 --> 01:56:35.480
archives has gone so deep now, we're really getting into these

01:56:35.680 --> 01:56:39.320
underappreciated classics, you know, this is pretty, pretty cool.

01:56:39.480 --> 01:56:40.320
All right.

01:56:40.520 --> 01:56:43.320
Certain games that didn't see a lot of light in the US.

01:56:43.520 --> 01:56:44.760
Yeah.

01:56:44.960 --> 01:56:46.000
That's very true.

01:56:46.200 --> 01:56:47.560
All right, let's travel around the world

01:56:47.560 --> 01:56:50.640
and check out some release dates and some games that are coming out real soon.

01:56:50.840 --> 01:56:52.920

01:58:02.160 --> 01:58:04.000
That is it.

01:58:04.200 --> 01:58:08.040
Going to Japan and looking at the releases there on the Switch on October 14th,

01:58:08.040 --> 01:58:11.360
we have Monarch in regular and limited edition coming out of Japan.

01:58:11.560 --> 01:58:13.480
We have a game called Fight of Animals.

01:58:13.480 --> 01:58:15.400
Arena is coming out as well in Japan.

01:58:15.600 --> 01:58:17.520
I know this game exists here.

01:58:17.720 --> 01:58:20.040
Is it the same name here?

01:58:20.240 --> 01:58:21.120
Fight of Animals?

01:58:21.320 --> 01:58:25.080
It's Smash Brothers, but with like really overly character.

01:58:25.280 --> 01:58:29.560
I think it is. OK, I don't remember the name of it, but yeah, it's over here.

01:58:29.600 --> 01:58:31.560
OK, it's like a cat, but the cat is like

01:58:31.760 --> 01:58:35.840
super muscle cat and like it's just Smash Brothers with all these animals.

01:58:35.960 --> 01:58:36.920
There's a whale in it.

01:58:37.120 --> 01:58:40.080
It looks that I don't know if it's the same name.

01:58:40.080 --> 01:58:41.320
It's what Brutal should have been.

01:58:41.520 --> 01:58:44.720
I know I've seen this game over here because I was thinking, oh,

01:58:44.720 --> 01:58:47.760
that would be a fun thing to pick up. But Japan's getting it this week.

01:58:47.960 --> 01:58:52.440
Earth Defense Force 3 gets its Nintendo Switch release this week over in Japan.

01:58:52.640 --> 01:58:55.160
And I think that is it for the Switch.

01:58:55.360 --> 01:58:58.440
So let me quickly take a look at the PlayStation 5

01:58:58.640 --> 01:59:00.200
and look at the releases there.

01:59:00.400 --> 01:59:02.680
If I can ever get down to.

01:59:04.160 --> 01:59:07.400
Sorry, I need an actual mouse for this thing I'm using now.

01:59:07.600 --> 01:59:11.560
It's the worst to have to use a touchpad touchpad.

01:59:12.560 --> 01:59:18.040
OK, on the PlayStation 5, we have Demon Slayer, Kimetsu no Yaiba,

01:59:18.240 --> 01:59:22.240
Hinokami Kaputan comes out this week, and that is on the PlayStation 5.

01:59:22.440 --> 01:59:26.760
And the Monarch is also seeing a PlayStation 5 release this week.

01:59:26.960 --> 01:59:28.480
That's it.

01:59:29.080 --> 01:59:31.560
So how about the UK, Dark Soccer?

01:59:34.200 --> 01:59:38.440
On the UK, we have on the 12th, we have

01:59:38.640 --> 01:59:41.240
Shuan Yan Sword 7.

01:59:41.440 --> 01:59:47.480
That's going to be PlayStation, Xbox also the same day, same systems back for blood.

01:59:47.680 --> 01:59:54.600
On the 14th, we have the Rift Breaker, same systems, 15th, NHL 22,

01:59:54.800 --> 01:59:59.520
Crisis Remastered, Demon Slayer, Kimetsu no Yaiba,

01:59:59.720 --> 02:00:05.160
I got tongue tied, Kimetsu no Yaiba, the Hinokami Chronicles.

02:00:05.360 --> 02:00:10.920
We have also on the 15th, Story of Seasons, Friends of Mineral Town,

02:00:11.120 --> 02:00:14.640
and then Just Die Already.

02:00:14.840 --> 02:00:16.520
On a bunch of stuff.

02:00:17.760 --> 02:00:20.000
All right, is that it?

02:00:20.200 --> 02:00:22.960
That's it. I will have you know, I looked up that animal game.

02:00:22.960 --> 02:00:25.520
It is also called Fight of Animals here locally.

02:00:25.520 --> 02:00:26.720
That's what I thought. Yeah.

02:00:26.920 --> 02:00:29.080
And actually, it's been out. I think it's on Steam.

02:00:29.280 --> 02:00:33.360
It is. It is on Steam and it went up on Steam December of 2019.

02:00:33.560 --> 02:00:35.000
So this game's been out a little while.

02:00:35.000 --> 02:00:37.800
It's just Japan is getting a Switch release of it this week.

02:00:38.000 --> 02:00:40.280
So I'm like, I knew I've seen this game around.

02:00:40.480 --> 02:00:41.840
I might have to get it on Switch.

02:00:41.880 --> 02:00:42.960
Yeah, that'd be a lot of fun.

02:00:43.160 --> 02:00:44.920
So, yeah. All right.

02:00:45.120 --> 02:00:47.800
We are going to now get back into some news.

02:00:48.000 --> 02:00:50.840
We're also going to invite your phone calls later in the show,

02:00:51.040 --> 02:00:53.840
as well as possibly any emails, if we actually got any.

02:00:54.040 --> 02:00:58.160
Participate at Orangelandtrady.com if you want to be old school and send an email.

02:00:58.360 --> 02:01:00.000
But send an email for now.

02:01:00.200 --> 02:01:01.600
We have a few more stories.

02:01:01.800 --> 02:01:02.760
Loki.

02:01:02.960 --> 02:01:07.920
Yeah, so right now, the Ryoga Gotoku

02:01:08.120 --> 02:01:11.480
studio, the developer, of course, behind the Yakuza series,

02:01:11.480 --> 02:01:13.000
they're going through a restructure right now.

02:01:13.200 --> 02:01:17.360
They've had some folks leaving the studio,

02:01:17.520 --> 02:01:25.080
including the departure of the series creator and game director, Tosho.

02:01:25.280 --> 02:01:28.720
I'm going to let me butcher some Japanese names.

02:01:28.920 --> 02:01:32.560
Toshihiro Nagoshi.

02:01:32.760 --> 02:01:38.240
He has left, as well as the.

02:01:38.440 --> 02:01:41.880
Was it the former series producer as well in the in the creator?

02:01:41.880 --> 02:01:43.320
So.

02:01:44.800 --> 02:01:47.680
That's quite a few people leaving

02:01:47.880 --> 02:01:49.680
and then, of course, along with this,

02:01:49.880 --> 02:01:53.720
we did get the news that there is going to be a sequel to Yakuza,

02:01:53.720 --> 02:01:57.600
like a dragon, which I'm very excited about and I actually need to finish that game.

02:01:57.800 --> 02:02:00.000
But yeah, a little bit of a restructure

02:02:00.200 --> 02:02:03.760
with some of those big heads of the company leaving.

02:02:06.520 --> 02:02:07.640
But.

02:02:07.840 --> 02:02:08.920
I'm excited for the series.

02:02:09.080 --> 02:02:11.040
Yeah, looking in chat, S.J. 100 Matt says,

02:02:11.040 --> 02:02:13.400
at least they said like a dragon two is still happening.

02:02:13.600 --> 02:02:15.600
Maybe I'll be like a dragon one by them.

02:02:15.800 --> 02:02:19.000
Big mood, Matt, because I still have Bobby.

02:02:19.200 --> 02:02:22.680
Bobby is like hiding in the bushes outside going, you beat like a dragon yet?

02:02:22.880 --> 02:02:25.160
You played like a dragon yet?

02:02:25.360 --> 02:02:27.560
So I need to I need to know.

02:02:27.760 --> 02:02:30.600
I have one game I own on the Xbox Series X.

02:02:30.800 --> 02:02:34.680
I need to be I need to be careful because I don't want to pass that point where I

02:02:34.680 --> 02:02:37.720
can't just pick up where I left off and I have to start all over again,

02:02:37.880 --> 02:02:40.160
because, you know, it be like that with some RPGs.

02:02:40.280 --> 02:02:43.720
If you let it go for too long, then you're like, where was I at in the story?

02:02:43.920 --> 02:02:45.840
Ah, fuck it. I'll start from the beginning.

02:02:46.040 --> 02:02:47.480
Maybe I'll maybe I'll do things different.

02:02:47.680 --> 02:02:50.040
Maybe I'll know to save three million yen this time.

02:02:50.240 --> 02:02:54.880
So anyway, I need I need to watch myself and get back into that soon.

02:02:55.080 --> 02:02:57.480
Maybe Bobby, maybe I'm not going to promise,

02:02:57.680 --> 02:03:02.000
but maybe that'll be a game that I do a stream of next week.

02:03:02.200 --> 02:03:04.280
We'll see. I'm not going to stream Monday because

02:03:04.280 --> 02:03:08.920
Jamie's got her thing going on, but maybe maybe one of the other days I stream.

02:03:08.920 --> 02:03:10.440
I still want to do another play through a dread.

02:03:10.440 --> 02:03:12.400
So maybe it'll be later in the week, like a Thursday, Friday thing.

02:03:12.600 --> 02:03:14.720
We'll see. All right.

02:03:15.560 --> 02:03:18.320
Anyhow, let's move on

02:03:18.520 --> 02:03:21.240
and talk about this. Oh, talk about adding games to the backlog.

02:03:21.440 --> 02:03:26.400
Well, here we go. A long running rumor on Orange Launch Radio and really here at all

02:03:26.600 --> 02:03:30.120
of VOG Network finally coming to fruition this week as we have had

02:03:30.160 --> 02:03:34.640
the confirmation that a Tron arcade one up is happening.

02:03:34.840 --> 02:03:36.760
But that's actually not the leading

02:03:36.760 --> 02:03:40.880
headline for a lot of sites reporting on this, because a lot of people are catching

02:03:41.080 --> 02:03:45.560
the fact that Ridge Racer is also one of the cabinets that's being released.

02:03:45.760 --> 02:03:47.600
Loki's asked many times on this program.

02:03:47.600 --> 02:03:49.360
I think Dark Soccer's asked it, too, quite frankly.

02:03:49.560 --> 02:03:51.400
When are we getting a new Ridge Racer?

02:03:51.600 --> 02:03:54.560
Well, here's something.

02:03:54.760 --> 02:03:57.560
It's something. It's not new.

02:03:57.760 --> 02:04:00.880
Anyway, Arcade One Up is doing a Ridge Racer cabinet.

02:04:01.080 --> 02:04:02.280
It has five games in it.

02:04:02.480 --> 02:04:08.440
Ridge Racer, Ridge Racer 2, Rave Racer, Ace Driver and Ace Driver Victory Lap.

02:04:08.640 --> 02:04:10.160
So that's kind of neat.

02:04:10.360 --> 02:04:13.480
Also, what's interesting, some of those games

02:04:13.680 --> 02:04:17.000
have not been on home consoles or even PC.

02:04:17.200 --> 02:04:18.880
So this is really the first time you can

02:04:19.080 --> 02:04:22.080
have them in your house, which is kind of awesome.

02:04:22.280 --> 02:04:24.680
So this is really the only way you can do

02:04:24.720 --> 02:04:28.960
this and play these games unless you happen to own the arcade machines.

02:04:29.160 --> 02:04:32.280
It's especially noted that Rave Racer is

02:04:32.480 --> 02:04:35.960
kind of a neat entry to be here in this particular list.

02:04:36.160 --> 02:04:37.640
That's pretty cool. Yeah.

02:04:37.840 --> 02:04:40.200
Dark Soccer. They're not R4.

02:04:40.400 --> 02:04:44.960
When do we get the Wangan Midnight Maximum Tune Arcade One Up cabinet?

02:04:45.160 --> 02:04:47.400
I wish. Those are a little too recent.

02:04:47.600 --> 02:04:49.800
I well, yeah, they're up to like number eight.

02:04:49.800 --> 02:04:53.640
I think when I was at round one last, I saw initial D is like on eight or nine

02:04:53.680 --> 02:04:55.120
and Wangan's around the same number.

02:04:55.320 --> 02:04:57.200
I'm like, I'm so old or I'll take it.

02:04:57.400 --> 02:05:03.800
I'll take it. Then I then I launched 2DX 28 style and I was like back in my day.

02:05:05.840 --> 02:05:09.520
And then I went on to the local Discord and saw that they were talking about they

02:05:09.720 --> 02:05:14.640
couldn't play a game because one of the Bahmani Boomers was hogging the machine.

02:05:14.840 --> 02:05:16.520
Somebody actually used that term.

02:05:16.640 --> 02:05:17.880
I don't think they were talking about me

02:05:17.880 --> 02:05:19.880
because when I was there, like nobody else there.

02:05:20.000 --> 02:05:22.520
But I I fucking laughed my ass off.

02:05:22.720 --> 02:05:24.920
Dark Soccer Loki were Bahmani Boomers.

02:05:25.120 --> 02:05:26.760
Did you know that?

02:05:27.280 --> 02:05:29.760
At least they have a name for us now.

02:05:30.600 --> 02:05:32.120
They still know how to play Deluxe.

02:05:32.320 --> 02:05:35.320
That person got yelled at and said, don't use that term and all that stuff.

02:05:35.320 --> 02:05:37.360
And so I was like, OK, they're behaving.

02:05:37.560 --> 02:05:38.600
I think it's funny.

02:05:38.800 --> 02:05:40.400
Yeah, I think it's funny, too, actually.

02:05:40.600 --> 02:05:42.280
So it's just it's just so funny.

02:05:42.480 --> 02:05:47.840
It's it's interesting for me to think there are all these like DDR and Bahmani

02:05:47.840 --> 02:05:50.800
or at least there's I know of at least one that's been brought to my attention.

02:05:50.800 --> 02:05:51.760
I think there might be two.

02:05:51.960 --> 02:05:54.160
There's podcasts now about that.

02:05:54.360 --> 02:05:56.360
And they're probably did it first.

02:05:56.360 --> 02:05:57.680
I know they're probably doing those

02:05:57.880 --> 02:06:00.960
shows thinking no one's ever done this before.

02:06:01.160 --> 02:06:04.920
We did, but I think and no one I think it's adorable.

02:06:04.920 --> 02:06:06.560
I think it's adorable. You know what?

02:06:06.760 --> 02:06:11.360
I'm always about going to the next generation and all that stuff.

02:06:11.560 --> 02:06:15.080
Maybe they will find that same love we did

02:06:15.080 --> 02:06:18.200
and end up continuing their show 20 years later about all sorts of things.

02:06:18.200 --> 02:06:19.960
So we'll still be doing ours.

02:06:20.160 --> 02:06:24.360
All right. Anyway, speaking of things, boomers like we

02:06:24.560 --> 02:06:28.000
also have Tron that cabinet is officially happening.

02:06:28.200 --> 02:06:31.160
Yay. Also, Killer Instinct is also and I

02:06:31.160 --> 02:06:32.840
bet there's a lot of people interested in that one, too.

02:06:32.840 --> 02:06:34.880
That is a cabinet that's happening as well.

02:06:35.080 --> 02:06:38.760
Killer Instinct also comes with Battletoads.

02:06:38.960 --> 02:06:40.480
So that's like a combo thing.

02:06:40.480 --> 02:06:41.760
The arcade battle rare.

02:06:41.960 --> 02:06:44.640
Yeah. So that's pretty cool.

02:06:44.880 --> 02:06:47.360
Tron preorders begin October 19th.

02:06:47.560 --> 02:06:49.560
It also has discs of Tron.

02:06:49.760 --> 02:06:52.360
Here's the thing. Yes, this has been brought to my attention.

02:06:52.560 --> 02:06:54.040
Somebody sent me the target listing.

02:06:54.240 --> 02:06:57.880
The target listing was like seven hundred dollars and.

02:06:58.080 --> 02:07:00.280
I just I can't I can't spend that right now.

02:07:00.280 --> 02:07:03.520
It's like you could buy the actual cabinet for that kind of money.

02:07:03.720 --> 02:07:05.440
Yeah, an actual cabinet.

02:07:05.640 --> 02:07:08.880
Look, I would spoil myself rotten anyway.

02:07:08.880 --> 02:07:10.840
I like the idea of the whole black light

02:07:10.840 --> 02:07:12.960
refractive, which I think the original cabinet had.

02:07:13.000 --> 02:07:15.720
I fully expect when I visit Bobby Blackwolf

02:07:15.920 --> 02:07:18.880
for Dragon Con twenty twenty two and go to his arcade again.

02:07:18.880 --> 02:07:20.880
I guess I just invited myself to Bobby's house again.

02:07:21.080 --> 02:07:23.640
But I fully expect I'll get to play that Tron machine.

02:07:23.840 --> 02:07:26.200
I know he'll have it in his house.

02:07:26.400 --> 02:07:31.920
And Bobby is pointing out you cannot buy the actual cabinet, not one that works.

02:07:32.120 --> 02:07:34.800
They those older machines are getting more expensive.

02:07:34.800 --> 02:07:36.440
It's because of the TVs in them.

02:07:36.640 --> 02:07:39.240
They're they're getting impossible to replace these days.

02:07:39.440 --> 02:07:41.200
Yeah, I know all about that.

02:07:41.200 --> 02:07:42.040
Yeah, exactly.

02:07:42.080 --> 02:07:43.080
So that's what's happening.

02:07:43.280 --> 02:07:48.400
Probably Loki, probably 10 years ago when like we were at the auction out

02:07:48.400 --> 02:07:50.960
in Roseville looking at these cabinets, you're right.

02:07:51.160 --> 02:07:55.120
I distinctly remember passing up a burger time machine for four hundred dollars.

02:07:55.320 --> 02:07:57.400
And I could have bought a burger time

02:07:57.400 --> 02:08:00.160
machine that worked for less money than what I ultimately bought.

02:08:00.160 --> 02:08:02.880
You just have to get money with private sellers.

02:08:03.080 --> 02:08:05.640
That's how I got my DDR cabinet.

02:08:05.840 --> 02:08:09.120
You just get you get someone that just doesn't care.

02:08:09.320 --> 02:08:11.480
They just want a certain amount of money for it.

02:08:11.520 --> 02:08:15.520
Like to them, it's just it's just better to get rid of it at that point.

02:08:15.720 --> 02:08:16.760
You can get lucky.

02:08:16.960 --> 02:08:20.640
So anyway, I have some major financial

02:08:20.640 --> 02:08:23.840
things that I haven't gotten into detail on the show yet.

02:08:23.840 --> 02:08:25.240
I will eventually, I promise.

02:08:25.440 --> 02:08:29.200
But there's just some stuff I have to save up for and make happen.

02:08:29.400 --> 02:08:33.560
And so seven hundred bucks out of that just I don't I just don't realistically

02:08:33.560 --> 02:08:34.960
think it's going to happen, unfortunately.

02:08:35.160 --> 02:08:36.760
If it's meant to happen, it'll happen.

02:08:36.960 --> 02:08:39.200
If, say, February, those machines are still

02:08:39.240 --> 02:08:42.640
available and I still have the money, then, yes, I'll pick one up.

02:08:42.840 --> 02:08:47.200
But if they're gone, it's sold out, then I guess it wasn't meant to happen.

02:08:47.400 --> 02:08:49.920
And I'll just hope that there's a reissue,

02:08:49.920 --> 02:08:53.240
like they've reissued some of those Namco machines 20 times over.

02:08:53.240 --> 02:08:55.880
I'm just going to have to cross my fingers and toes for that.

02:08:56.080 --> 02:09:00.760
After all, a lot of games ran on that Tron hardware that that hardware was

02:09:00.960 --> 02:09:05.640
the Bally Midway stuff that ran a journey.

02:09:05.800 --> 02:09:09.680
So that's what I'll hold out hope for is a Tron slash journey cabinet.

02:09:09.880 --> 02:09:15.480
Yes, the old band that ended up having a arcade game in the those.

02:09:15.680 --> 02:09:17.880
There's a lot of games on that hardware.

02:09:18.080 --> 02:09:19.880
Check out those Midway arcade treasures.

02:09:20.000 --> 02:09:22.160
Tron was never in there because of the Disney thing,

02:09:22.360 --> 02:09:26.840
but a lot of games ran on that hardware.

02:09:27.360 --> 02:09:30.440
Bobby's pointing out the TV and the joystick.

02:09:30.640 --> 02:09:34.560
Tron used a very unique, yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:09:34.720 --> 02:09:36.960
So the replica will be very nice to have, I think.

02:09:36.960 --> 02:09:39.040
I think it would just be nice to have like a newer one.

02:09:39.240 --> 02:09:41.000
So. All right.

02:09:41.200 --> 02:09:44.120
Yeah, dark to see a points out there's problems with the journey cabinet

02:09:44.320 --> 02:09:47.720
because journey's changed their lead singer a couple of times now.

02:09:47.920 --> 02:09:50.440
So it would get complicated.

02:09:50.640 --> 02:09:54.000
Do they still have the guy with the pretty hair?

02:09:54.520 --> 02:09:56.640
I think his name is Arnelle or Artell.

02:09:56.640 --> 02:09:57.560
I'm sorry, I forgot his name.

02:09:57.760 --> 02:10:00.560
But yes, he's he's still the guy that's been like him.

02:10:00.760 --> 02:10:03.520
He's been there for almost 10 years now.

02:10:03.720 --> 02:10:06.880
We we saw him when he was new.

02:10:07.080 --> 02:10:08.960
Yeah, no, I know, I know when we went to see Journey.

02:10:09.080 --> 02:10:11.000
Yeah, was that the one where Heart opened?

02:10:11.000 --> 02:10:15.000
And the reason why I'll never go back to that cheap trick, cheap trick opened.

02:10:15.200 --> 02:10:19.280
And then Heart, we missed cheap trick because of the parking, remember?

02:10:19.480 --> 02:10:21.560
But we could hear Heart from the parking lot here.

02:10:21.560 --> 02:10:24.040
Heart, that pissed me off so much. I'll never go back to that venue.

02:10:24.240 --> 02:10:24.760
All right. Yeah.

02:10:24.960 --> 02:10:27.880
But I think I was like singing with everything that Heart did.

02:10:28.080 --> 02:10:29.320
Of course, of course.

02:10:29.520 --> 02:10:31.080
Thank you. VX chase next to me.

02:10:31.120 --> 02:10:33.360
Arnell Pineda, that's his name.

02:10:33.560 --> 02:10:36.120
Yes, he's he's still the guy that he's great.

02:10:36.320 --> 02:10:39.360
And he sounds just like Steve Perry.

02:10:39.560 --> 02:10:41.240
Yeah. Yeah.

02:10:41.440 --> 02:10:45.560
All right, moving on, Dark Sakura.

02:10:45.760 --> 02:10:50.880
So this is something that actually I think I think is very important to me in

02:10:51.080 --> 02:10:59.200
particular, but there is a a group called AbleGamers that have put

02:10:59.200 --> 02:11:04.680
out some criticized different companies for their lack of accessibility options.

02:11:04.880 --> 02:11:06.560
And so

02:11:07.160 --> 02:11:08.720
now

02:11:08.920 --> 02:11:13.680
there is an attempt to try to help disabled gamers find games that they can play.

02:11:13.880 --> 02:11:16.320
There's a nonprofit organization called

02:11:16.520 --> 02:11:20.680
Dagger System that created the Accessible Games Database.

02:11:20.880 --> 02:11:26.640
So in a nutshell, it includes right now 144 games with their accessibility

02:11:26.640 --> 02:11:31.840
options, including Last of Us Part Two, Control, Cyberpunk 2077, Tetris 99.

02:11:32.040 --> 02:11:37.520
People can search by publisher, genre and platform and you can filter for auditory

02:11:37.720 --> 02:11:39.720
visual and motor features.

02:11:39.920 --> 02:11:42.920
So it has like other different subcategories.

02:11:43.120 --> 02:11:45.200
But I think it's really neat.

02:11:45.200 --> 02:11:46.240
The filters aren't final.

02:11:46.440 --> 02:11:52.320
It's still a little bit in development, but I think it will be really useful to

02:11:52.320 --> 02:11:56.520
have something like this for gamers who have limitations in playing.

02:11:56.720 --> 02:11:58.800
This is great. This is one of those things where I'm kind

02:11:58.800 --> 02:12:02.440
of surprised it didn't exist already and maybe it kind of did in like Google

02:12:02.440 --> 02:12:05.000
documents that were circulating around and things like that.

02:12:05.000 --> 02:12:07.800
But I think it's nice that we have like a very comprehensive site.

02:12:08.000 --> 02:12:10.360
Jaskren in our chat says AbleGamers.

02:12:10.560 --> 02:12:12.760
Hell yeah, I give you I wholeheartedly agree.

02:12:12.760 --> 02:12:13.920
Hell yeah.

02:12:14.120 --> 02:12:16.720
I think that's still the charity I have set on my Amazon right now.

02:12:16.920 --> 02:12:19.120
So, you know,

02:12:19.280 --> 02:12:22.920
I'm glad to see they're involved with such awesome projects still.

02:12:22.920 --> 02:12:24.800
I mean, I know they show up a lot of conventions.

02:12:25.000 --> 02:12:27.800
They do a lot of consulting and things of that nature.

02:12:28.000 --> 02:12:29.880
So good on them.

02:12:30.080 --> 02:12:32.520
Pat's on the back. Job well done.

02:12:32.720 --> 02:12:34.680
You're doing good, son.

02:12:34.880 --> 02:12:37.840
The Bamani Boomer says you're doing good, son.

02:12:38.040 --> 02:12:41.040
You're making me proud. All right.

02:12:41.240 --> 02:12:43.040
Jeez. All right.

02:12:43.240 --> 02:12:45.840
Then let's move on, Loki.

02:12:46.040 --> 02:12:47.120
Yep.

02:12:47.320 --> 02:12:49.880
So this is kind of exciting and we kind

02:12:49.880 --> 02:12:52.760
of figured this would happen with any new game that comes out,

02:12:52.960 --> 02:12:58.800
but people have been data mining Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl and found files

02:12:59.000 --> 02:13:04.280
they're hinting at the new future characters that may be coming in DLC.

02:13:04.480 --> 02:13:07.000
So some of the things that I thought were

02:13:07.200 --> 02:13:13.360
kind of funny is they had a character, there's a bunch of files for cheese.

02:13:13.560 --> 02:13:19.040
And of course, that has to do with Shredder, which I thought was pretty funny.

02:13:19.240 --> 02:13:22.680
Some other stuff, you know, we had references to Mr.

02:13:22.880 --> 02:13:29.120
Krabs, Squidward, Plankton, Tommy Pickles, Jimmy Neutron and Rocko

02:13:29.320 --> 02:13:34.840
from Rocko's Modern Life also listed in there.

02:13:35.040 --> 02:13:37.520
They said that, you know,

02:13:37.720 --> 02:13:41.600
the actual community manager for the game, Thaddeus Cruz,

02:13:41.800 --> 02:13:46.280
said that some of the leaks, you know, or some of the concerns that they had

02:13:46.480 --> 02:13:52.400
with these types of leaks is that it doesn't necessarily mean that the content

02:13:52.600 --> 02:13:54.880
was removed. It could have been stuff that they were

02:13:55.080 --> 02:13:58.600
considering, just didn't end up putting in the game.

02:13:58.800 --> 02:14:00.400
You know, they said it wasn't removed.

02:14:00.600 --> 02:14:04.240
This is voice lines in the project, a covered voice lines in the project,

02:14:04.440 --> 02:14:09.760
cover bases and are not to be the end or be all end all confirmations of what can

02:14:09.800 --> 02:14:12.080
and cannot happen.

02:14:12.280 --> 02:14:13.880
So.

02:14:14.320 --> 02:14:17.160
Yeah, I'm curious to see what DLC they're going to have for this game.

02:14:17.160 --> 02:14:19.240
I think it's gonna be pretty cool.

02:14:20.320 --> 02:14:24.040
Yeah, I'm going to admit, even though I shaded the game a little bit earlier

02:14:24.240 --> 02:14:25.840
earlier in the show, I've just seen it.

02:14:26.040 --> 02:14:30.360
Oh, and when I missed here, they also had a reference to a Garfield stage.

02:14:30.560 --> 02:14:32.040
Oh, God.

02:14:32.240 --> 02:14:34.280
Has it made a lasagna?

02:14:34.480 --> 02:14:37.320
So I honestly haven't played the game.

02:14:37.320 --> 02:14:39.440
I've just been hearing things about the game.

02:14:39.480 --> 02:14:42.320
And I did watch one of a streamer.

02:14:42.320 --> 02:14:45.160
You like to Dark Soccer Lapin, the guy up in Vancouver.

02:14:45.160 --> 02:14:47.040
He was playing this Nickelodeon game.

02:14:47.040 --> 02:14:49.760
And I was kind of looking at it, but I was kind of looking at it.

02:14:49.960 --> 02:14:52.040
Yeah, it was late one night.

02:14:52.240 --> 02:14:55.840
But anyway, I did when I was watching him play it.

02:14:56.040 --> 02:15:00.440
I was kind of like, this does feel a little bit like just in the setup

02:15:00.440 --> 02:15:01.440
and the menus and everything.

02:15:01.640 --> 02:15:04.760
This is very like bare bones, like knock off Smash Brothers.

02:15:04.880 --> 02:15:06.360
But then when they got into the fight

02:15:06.360 --> 02:15:09.040
and everything, it looked like it was cute, but it did look I've heard it's

02:15:09.040 --> 02:15:14.520
a little bit sluggish and doesn't it feels like it is a copy of Smash

02:15:14.720 --> 02:15:17.080
Brothers and not the real thing, if that makes sense.

02:15:17.280 --> 02:15:18.720
So, yeah.

02:15:18.920 --> 02:15:20.680
But you know what?

02:15:20.680 --> 02:15:23.600
I think the reason why people are still enjoying it and I think it will show up

02:15:23.600 --> 02:15:26.760
in competitive events and I think they'll probably continue to improve it.

02:15:26.960 --> 02:15:32.200
The roster is strong and a lot of what you just kind of added to that, even me.

02:15:32.400 --> 02:15:36.360
Boomer can go in and look and I'm like, oh,

02:15:36.400 --> 02:15:40.720
I recognize I recognize Ren Stimpy, Invader Zim, powdered toast, man.

02:15:40.720 --> 02:15:41.680
Like there was a lot of characters.

02:15:41.680 --> 02:15:44.040
I was like, OK, even my old ass knows these characters.

02:15:44.240 --> 02:15:47.680
So there were some I didn't know, but there were quite a few.

02:15:47.680 --> 02:15:49.080
I did. I was like, oh, April O'Neill.

02:15:49.080 --> 02:15:51.000
I know her, you know, and that whole thing.

02:15:51.000 --> 02:15:52.800
So 80s Ninja Turtles, too.

02:15:53.000 --> 02:15:53.840
So, yeah, yeah.

02:15:54.040 --> 02:15:56.080
It's what's the one people remember, Loki?

02:15:56.280 --> 02:15:57.360
That's the thing.

02:15:57.560 --> 02:15:59.960
If April O'Neill isn't wearing that bright

02:16:00.160 --> 02:16:02.840
yellow pantsuit, then is it really April O'Neill?

02:16:03.040 --> 02:16:05.400
It's not. It's not.

02:16:05.600 --> 02:16:08.680
My favorite April O'Neill

02:16:08.880 --> 02:16:12.280
is the one on the side of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles arcade cabinet.

02:16:12.480 --> 02:16:16.280
Take a really good look at that fake ass fucking wig she's wearing.

02:16:16.480 --> 02:16:21.040
Next time you next time you walk by a 90s Ninja Turtle arcade cabinet,

02:16:21.240 --> 02:16:25.840
take a real good look at April O'Neill on there that she walked right out

02:16:26.040 --> 02:16:29.400
of Party City's clearance aisle, OK?

02:16:29.600 --> 02:16:32.960
And what a queen, Lord, what a queen.

02:16:33.120 --> 02:16:35.520
All right. And and oh, my God.

02:16:35.720 --> 02:16:41.840
Well, she kind of resembles the the movie April O'Neill, sort of.

02:16:42.040 --> 02:16:43.920
Yeah, no, she she does.

02:16:44.120 --> 02:16:46.680
But yeah, that that is not her hair.

02:16:46.880 --> 02:16:50.000
DJ Romas says it may be a fake wig, but the model is hella cute.

02:16:50.200 --> 02:16:52.200
I'm not shading her whatsoever.

02:16:52.400 --> 02:16:53.800
She's iconic.

02:16:54.000 --> 02:16:55.840
OK, that is actually a compliment.

02:16:56.040 --> 02:16:58.040
But let's not kid ourselves.

02:16:58.080 --> 02:17:03.080
She's iconic because she's wearing a ninety nine cent piece of vinyl very well.

02:17:03.280 --> 02:17:07.480
OK, it's like and I don't mean that in a like weird stalker way.

02:17:07.480 --> 02:17:09.200
I just mean she's a queen. All right.

02:17:09.400 --> 02:17:11.120
Yeah. Moving on.

02:17:11.320 --> 02:17:12.440
She wears it well.

02:17:12.640 --> 02:17:14.280
Yes, she wears it well.

02:17:14.480 --> 02:17:16.840
Boop, boop, boop. OK,

02:17:17.040 --> 02:17:17.920
moving on.

02:17:18.120 --> 02:17:21.440
Are people are are multiple people linking that in chat?

02:17:21.640 --> 02:17:23.640
That must be what it is now.

02:17:23.840 --> 02:17:26.160
I appreciate you chatters.

02:17:26.360 --> 02:17:27.200
Moving on.

02:17:27.360 --> 02:17:30.000
There was an update to World of Warcraft.

02:17:30.200 --> 02:17:31.520
They've been kind of going back through

02:17:31.720 --> 02:17:36.160
that game with a fine tooth comb and clearing out some of the oofs things.

02:17:36.160 --> 02:17:39.160
You know, World of Warcraft is an old ass game at this point, right?

02:17:39.160 --> 02:17:41.480
It's a it's like 15 years old at this point, right?

02:17:41.680 --> 02:17:44.280
Yeah, you've done an expansion as the classic game of the week.

02:17:44.480 --> 02:17:47.040
The game itself is over 15 years at this point.

02:17:47.240 --> 02:17:48.560
So.

02:17:48.760 --> 02:17:52.320
There are some things in there that don't read very well this day and age,

02:17:52.320 --> 02:17:55.000
especially with the lens that Blizzard is under right now.

02:17:55.200 --> 02:17:58.600
So there were some things that were removed.

02:17:58.800 --> 02:18:03.600
So sometimes some characters that had a lot of dialog before.

02:18:04.680 --> 02:18:06.760
Do not have as much dialog now.

02:18:06.960 --> 02:18:09.200
Oh, this is the stuff you remember.

02:18:09.400 --> 02:18:13.000
OK, you remember when you would click them and they would say things.

02:18:13.200 --> 02:18:17.440
So like the Torrin male used to say, homogenized.

02:18:17.640 --> 02:18:20.000
No way. I like the ladies.

02:18:20.200 --> 02:18:23.080
Now, look, I'm gay.

02:18:23.280 --> 02:18:26.720
I, I look at that and I just go.

02:18:26.920 --> 02:18:28.520
I'm not offended by that joke.

02:18:28.720 --> 02:18:31.480
I just think it's stupid, but OK, it is kind of stupid.

02:18:31.480 --> 02:18:32.960
Yeah, that's why it's stupid.

02:18:33.160 --> 02:18:36.760
But there's a lot of stupid stuff in video games, whatever.

02:18:36.960 --> 02:18:43.480
But I also understand why now in the year 2021 with everything,

02:18:43.480 --> 02:18:46.040
you know, that we're looking at, especially it's going on Blizzard.

02:18:46.040 --> 02:18:47.600
I understand why they made an editorial

02:18:47.800 --> 02:18:51.360
choice to say, you know what, I'm going to get that joke on out of there.

02:18:51.520 --> 02:18:52.840
I don't know.

02:18:53.040 --> 02:18:55.640
Maybe they should have taken the time to get a new line.

02:18:55.840 --> 02:18:57.000
But maybe some of these same voice

02:18:57.000 --> 02:18:59.160
actors aren't available or anything like that anymore.

02:18:59.360 --> 02:19:02.960
I'm not I'm not sure anyway.

02:19:03.160 --> 02:19:04.320
There's some other ones that are.

02:19:04.520 --> 02:19:07.360
Yeah, like the orc female says, what's estrogen?

02:19:07.360 --> 02:19:09.760
Can you eat it? That is no longer there either.

02:19:09.960 --> 02:19:12.360
That one's a bit of a yike, a little bit.

02:19:12.560 --> 02:19:16.920
The blood elf demon hunter used to say, are you sure you're not part demon?

02:19:17.120 --> 02:19:19.160
I find myself wanting to stalk you.

02:19:19.360 --> 02:19:20.280
That's an oof.

02:19:20.480 --> 02:19:23.400
So there's there you definitely look at a lot of these things they removed.

02:19:23.600 --> 02:19:26.240
And you go the mount writing the mount.

02:19:26.440 --> 02:19:27.640
Yeah, yeah.

02:19:27.640 --> 02:19:31.960
So there's a lot of these things that you look at and you go, oof, didn't age well.

02:19:32.160 --> 02:19:33.720
So there it goes.

02:19:33.920 --> 02:19:35.560
Now, of course, some of your,

02:19:35.760 --> 02:19:39.240
you know, people that didn't even probably realize these jokes were there,

02:19:39.440 --> 02:19:43.800
of course, are getting outraged over it because, you know, my my my censorship,

02:19:43.800 --> 02:19:45.120
my video, you know what?

02:19:45.320 --> 02:19:47.840
There's been a lot that's changed in World of Warcraft over the years.

02:19:47.840 --> 02:19:48.880
In fact, so much has changed.

02:19:48.880 --> 02:19:49.760
I don't play it anymore.

02:19:49.840 --> 02:19:51.520
But it has nothing to do with the dialog.

02:19:51.720 --> 02:19:54.840
It has to do with the other choices made in the game as to how it plays.

02:19:55.040 --> 02:19:56.640
So

02:19:56.840 --> 02:19:59.320
I appreciate that they are modernizing

02:19:59.520 --> 02:20:03.600
the dialog like they are attempting to modernize everything else.

02:20:03.800 --> 02:20:06.440
Speaking of choices,

02:20:06.640 --> 02:20:12.120
let's also talk about a related story, also known as that time that Nintendo was

02:20:12.320 --> 02:20:18.680
horny, specifically Nintendo of France, they decided to tweet an image

02:20:18.880 --> 02:20:25.320
this last weekend of Metal Gear Solid Snake looking at Samus in the Zero

02:20:25.520 --> 02:20:29.680
Mission suit, it's very clearly a screenshot that was taken in

02:20:29.880 --> 02:20:31.040
Super Smash.

02:20:31.240 --> 02:20:32.920
But the way it looks like it looks like

02:20:33.120 --> 02:20:38.200
Metal Solid Snake is just straight up staring at Samus's ass.

02:20:38.400 --> 02:20:40.360
And then they deleted the tweet.

02:20:40.560 --> 02:20:43.240
I think they tweeted it with the eyes emoji.

02:20:43.440 --> 02:20:46.320
I want to say what did they tweet it with?

02:20:46.520 --> 02:20:47.160
Where was it?

02:20:47.160 --> 02:20:48.680
I'm trying to look at the original tweet here.

02:20:48.680 --> 02:20:50.680
My screen must be too. Yeah, that's what it was.

02:20:50.680 --> 02:20:51.720
Just the eyes emoji.

02:20:51.920 --> 02:20:53.120
That's all they tweeted.

02:20:53.320 --> 02:20:55.600
You know, so that's what I do.

02:20:55.800 --> 02:20:59.120
I you know, people are horny on Twitter all the time, right?

02:20:59.320 --> 02:21:03.200
People, people, Loki, I know you've been Twitter is a thirsty spot.

02:21:03.400 --> 02:21:05.520
I know you've been a victim of being

02:21:05.720 --> 02:21:08.240
attacked by horny Twitter when you weren't ready for it.

02:21:08.240 --> 02:21:09.560
Right.

02:21:10.400 --> 02:21:12.200
So sometimes these tweets will get in your

02:21:12.400 --> 02:21:15.360
timeline, it's up somebody's horny on main.

02:21:15.520 --> 02:21:20.320
Once in a while, I might indulge or respond, so I'm sorry, but I will usually

02:21:20.520 --> 02:21:26.000
respond with said eyes emoji, it's the perfect response to those sorts of tweets.

02:21:26.200 --> 02:21:27.800
That's it.

02:21:28.920 --> 02:21:30.560
But anyway.

02:21:30.760 --> 02:21:32.400
We just need a trombone icon.

02:21:32.600 --> 02:21:36.400
It was deleted, it was it was nuked into orbit.

02:21:36.600 --> 02:21:38.080
I'm assuming

02:21:38.280 --> 02:21:40.840
at the rest of Nintendo outside of France,

02:21:41.040 --> 02:21:43.440
they probably had a hard time seeing the humor in that.

02:21:43.640 --> 02:21:44.960
Anyway.

02:21:45.560 --> 02:21:48.080
Let's see, DJ says it's always an intern,

02:21:48.080 --> 02:21:50.640
probably that monkey says probably was an intern, probably.

02:21:50.840 --> 02:21:53.480
I don't know if it was necessarily an intern, but it was just probably somebody

02:21:53.680 --> 02:21:57.800
on social media that was like, this will go viral and didn't stop to think about.

02:21:58.000 --> 02:22:00.360
Is that good, though?

02:22:00.560 --> 02:22:01.600
Oof.

02:22:01.800 --> 02:22:03.520
Should it go viral?

02:22:03.720 --> 02:22:04.960
Should it go viral?

02:22:05.160 --> 02:22:06.400
Excellent question.

02:22:06.600 --> 02:22:07.080
All right.

02:22:07.080 --> 02:22:08.920
I think we're up to the part of the show

02:22:08.920 --> 02:22:11.960
that is the listener roundtable where we're going to invite your calls and so

02:22:12.000 --> 02:22:15.120
forth, you can call in via our Discord server,

02:22:15.320 --> 02:22:17.400
vognetwork.com Discord.

02:22:17.600 --> 02:22:20.400
You guys, we already have a caller in Discord ready to go.

02:22:20.400 --> 02:22:21.560
So what do you say we get to it?

02:22:21.560 --> 02:22:22.960
Let's invite somebody else on the show here.

02:22:22.960 --> 02:22:24.400
Sound good? Sure.

02:22:24.440 --> 02:22:25.280
All right, let's do it.

02:22:25.480 --> 02:22:28.080
And we're going to bring them in and say hello.

02:22:28.080 --> 02:22:29.560
And hi, you're on Orange Lawns Radio.

02:22:29.760 --> 02:22:30.680
Who's this?

02:22:30.880 --> 02:22:35.000
It is he who requires more than 20 seconds to talk about things tonight.

02:22:35.000 --> 02:22:36.600
Hey, Jason, how you doing, sir?

02:22:36.600 --> 02:22:38.040
I'm trying to find the right screenshot there.

02:22:38.040 --> 02:22:39.440
There we go. Hi, Jason.

02:22:39.440 --> 02:22:40.440
How are you?

02:22:40.600 --> 02:22:43.440
I am doing OK.

02:22:43.640 --> 02:22:44.560
OK. All right.

02:22:44.560 --> 02:22:47.200
Well, OK is better than crappy, so we'll take it.

02:22:47.400 --> 02:22:49.840
Yeah, I hope things get even better for you tomorrow.

02:22:50.040 --> 02:22:51.160
Exactly.

02:22:51.360 --> 02:22:54.440
Well, it is a Monday, so there's no guarantees about that.

02:22:54.640 --> 02:22:56.360
We'll do our best.

02:22:56.560 --> 02:22:58.680
I want to talk about Facebook.

02:22:58.880 --> 02:23:01.240
Actually, I don't want to, but I'm going to.

02:23:01.440 --> 02:23:02.840
OK, can we not?

02:23:03.040 --> 02:23:05.640
But OK, under that context, sure, go ahead.

02:23:05.840 --> 02:23:09.320
Yeah, the whole social network thing,

02:23:09.320 --> 02:23:11.440
the whole social network subject is really difficult.

02:23:11.640 --> 02:23:15.160
And before I say anything else, I think the important thing for me to say

02:23:15.360 --> 02:23:20.760
outright is I agree with all of the points that all of you make.

02:23:20.960 --> 02:23:23.480
Like I am in favor of Facebook being broken up.

02:23:23.680 --> 02:23:27.840
I am in favor of Facebook being less of the less of the, you know,

02:23:28.040 --> 02:23:31.080
the the predominant town square than it is.

02:23:31.280 --> 02:23:35.680
There's just kind of a there's kind of a way that Facebook is talked about.

02:23:35.880 --> 02:23:38.400
I think it's something that's not ever

02:23:38.480 --> 02:23:44.000
going to change, like some some business always has the ire of everyone.

02:23:44.000 --> 02:23:47.120
It's the you know, it's the it's the it's the Goliath problem.

02:23:47.120 --> 02:23:48.720
There's always going to be someone there.

02:23:48.920 --> 02:23:55.400
And the arguments, the way that people talk about Facebook as if they are the

02:23:55.600 --> 02:24:00.800
God, I can't I can't find the right word because catalyst is probably correct.

02:24:01.000 --> 02:24:06.800
Instigator is possibly correct in this context, like like

02:24:07.000 --> 02:24:10.640
there is always a social demon because the problem is not the service.

02:24:10.840 --> 02:24:11.920
The problem is not the medium.

02:24:12.120 --> 02:24:14.600
The problem is the people

02:24:14.800 --> 02:24:18.040
to a majority extent, like it's not Facebook, Facebook.

02:24:18.240 --> 02:24:23.920
Facebook did not get the the the the flat earthers together,

02:24:24.120 --> 02:24:27.840
but it does provide a place for conversation for them and outreach

02:24:28.040 --> 02:24:30.800
and marketing and viral blah, blah, blah.

02:24:31.000 --> 02:24:32.960
They made it really easy.

02:24:33.160 --> 02:24:36.440
Yeah, and that's not that's not necessarily a bad thing.

02:24:36.480 --> 02:24:42.080
However, the one thing that is applicable that is problematic with Facebook is

02:24:42.280 --> 02:24:45.960
basically everything they can't that came out of 60 Minutes is is

02:24:46.160 --> 02:24:50.360
as far as I'm aware, is a complete outsider, completely true.

02:24:50.560 --> 02:24:52.840
And this isn't even the first time we've heard these kinds of things.

02:24:53.040 --> 02:24:54.840
So a quick summary.

02:24:55.040 --> 02:24:58.200
60 Minutes was the whistleblower

02:24:58.400 --> 02:25:02.000
whose name that the lady's name I've already forgotten because it's foreign

02:25:02.000 --> 02:25:03.680
and just doesn't fit in my brain very well.

02:25:03.920 --> 02:25:08.040
It's fine for foreign foreign sounding, of course.

02:25:08.240 --> 02:25:11.040
She talked about how the civil ethics

02:25:11.240 --> 02:25:17.480
and civil research group within Facebook came to the conclusion that Instagram

02:25:17.680 --> 02:25:22.960
Instagram in particular was bad for especially teenage girls,

02:25:23.160 --> 02:25:26.240
self-image, self-confidence, self-worth, et cetera.

02:25:26.440 --> 02:25:31.080
I remember an article four or five years ago or somewhere

02:25:31.120 --> 02:25:35.600
around there that talked about a group within Facebook

02:25:36.360 --> 02:25:38.440
knowingly.

02:25:38.640 --> 02:25:42.640
Enacted a social experiment.

02:25:42.840 --> 02:25:45.320
On users

02:25:45.520 --> 02:25:49.840
with no consultation, they be, you know, in the in the era of the algorithm,

02:25:50.040 --> 02:25:57.440
they knowingly put they knowingly featured negative toned sounding posts

02:25:57.600 --> 02:26:00.320
into the preference of the individual's feed

02:26:00.520 --> 02:26:03.760
to see if it influenced the things that they then posted.

02:26:03.960 --> 02:26:09.000
So I I've I've you know, I was not a Facebook fan.

02:26:09.200 --> 02:26:12.120
I had my grievances for Facebook from the outset.

02:26:12.320 --> 02:26:17.000
I, like most other people, use it because as the predominant social network,

02:26:17.200 --> 02:26:23.160
I exactly as like Jamie said, I used it to keep in touch with people

02:26:23.360 --> 02:26:26.760
that a couple of years ago, I think it was I think it was twenty eighteen

02:26:26.760 --> 02:26:29.200
that I nuked all my social networking because like

02:26:29.400 --> 02:26:33.240
the amount that it was worth anything was not worth it.

02:26:33.440 --> 02:26:36.200
So I stepped out of Facebook entirely.

02:26:36.400 --> 02:26:37.760
I even stepped out of.

02:26:37.960 --> 02:26:39.880
I know you've got still got points to make, but I just want to say because

02:26:39.880 --> 02:26:43.000
something I had a click aha moment when you're talking about the body image

02:26:43.000 --> 02:26:45.960
things and some of the things that this targeted, you know, it's interesting.

02:26:45.960 --> 02:26:48.440
I mean, I know he said it very tongue in cheek early in the show,

02:26:48.440 --> 02:26:51.480
but when Loki was talking about why does he always see all these underwear ads

02:26:51.680 --> 02:26:56.240
on Facebook, I mean, in a way, if you think about it, a lot of those ads

02:26:56.440 --> 02:27:00.240
can I mean, we don't talk about male body positivity and all this stuff enough

02:27:00.440 --> 02:27:03.720
in our society, but there definitely is something about you look at a lot

02:27:03.720 --> 02:27:06.880
of those models and it's like, I'm never going to look like that.

02:27:07.080 --> 02:27:10.280
So, you know, in a weird in a weird way,

02:27:10.480 --> 02:27:15.920
even you and I, Loki, Dark Soccer, all of us as adults get

02:27:16.120 --> 02:27:18.960
faced with a lot of that body positive images.

02:27:18.960 --> 02:27:20.000
Oh, yeah. All of that.

02:27:20.000 --> 02:27:23.480
They also like advertising a ton of shirts that are supposed to make you look

02:27:23.480 --> 02:27:26.120
more slimmer and pants that make you look slimmer.

02:27:26.320 --> 02:27:28.120
It's like, who do you call me fat?

02:27:28.120 --> 02:27:29.600
There was a Facebook.

02:27:29.600 --> 02:27:31.480
Jason, it was just an interesting aha moment.

02:27:31.480 --> 02:27:34.440
I wanted to call out there that it's even though, yes,

02:27:34.920 --> 02:27:38.280
when we talk about kids, we get even angrier because kids are innocent

02:27:38.280 --> 02:27:38.840
and so forth.

02:27:38.840 --> 02:27:41.680
But it is very interesting when you really stop and think about it.

02:27:41.680 --> 02:27:43.880
Everybody's being targeted with that stuff. Everybody.

02:27:43.880 --> 02:27:46.360
Yeah, because because the problem is social.

02:27:46.360 --> 02:27:49.720
So there's this thing there's this thing that I've been saying at work

02:27:49.720 --> 02:27:53.320
as I'm as I've developed a lot more of my a lot more of my kind of like

02:27:53.320 --> 02:27:54.800
mentored leaning and whatnot.

02:27:56.600 --> 02:28:01.960
Social technology does not fix social problems.

02:28:02.680 --> 02:28:06.600
And when when I think about a lot of the prescriptive ways

02:28:06.600 --> 02:28:10.000
that things can be done to of things that could be done to Facebook,

02:28:10.000 --> 02:28:14.040
Allah breaking them up like at a high level, that's really important.

02:28:14.040 --> 02:28:18.320
But like, how do you how do you prescribe functional

02:28:18.320 --> 02:28:24.400
social behavior, both on the the enabler, the, you know, public space,

02:28:24.400 --> 02:28:31.440
little p public space versus like put the put the details on the people?

02:28:32.840 --> 02:28:35.520
It's the same problem with freedom of speech and so many other things

02:28:35.520 --> 02:28:38.480
like social, social, social problems are evergreen.

02:28:38.480 --> 02:28:40.680
Social problems are.

02:28:41.200 --> 02:28:45.400
Will social problems will exist forever because they are people.

02:28:45.760 --> 02:28:46.520
They'll be made worse.

02:28:46.520 --> 02:28:47.480
They'll be made better.

02:28:47.520 --> 02:28:49.200
Like, like everything's going to go around.

02:28:49.200 --> 02:28:52.920
But it's just kind of like the, you know, it's the it's the it's it's

02:28:52.920 --> 02:28:56.920
piling on the big dog situation that just kind of just kind of bums me out

02:28:56.920 --> 02:29:01.040
every once in a while to hear from anybody, all of these opinions, you

02:29:01.040 --> 02:29:04.760
know, not not not singling out the show whatsoever, because I late night

02:29:04.760 --> 02:29:08.120
and anybody else that rails about Facebook on Facebook, which is their

02:29:08.120 --> 02:29:12.400
prerogative to do, it's just a really difficult subject because social

02:29:12.400 --> 02:29:17.320
interaction is imperfect and you don't need any any any catalyst for that.

02:29:17.480 --> 02:29:18.080
Sure.

02:29:18.080 --> 02:29:19.080
But the thing.

02:29:19.080 --> 02:29:20.760
OK, so here's here's the thing.

02:29:20.760 --> 02:29:23.840
When it's I'm looking at a comment in chat from Square Tangle that says,

02:29:23.840 --> 02:29:26.520
bring back GeoCities, bring back LiveJournal, bring back Zonga.

02:29:26.520 --> 02:29:28.920
Hell, yeah, because I was such a fan of LiveJournal.

02:29:29.200 --> 02:29:34.200
I I wouldn't say I met Dark Soccer and Loki through LiveJournal or you, Jason.

02:29:34.200 --> 02:29:37.120
But our friendships were all strengthened through LiveJournal.

02:29:37.120 --> 02:29:39.600
We probably actually met on DDR Freak.

02:29:39.600 --> 02:29:40.760
You know, it's still there.

02:29:40.760 --> 02:29:42.000
Just highly Russian.

02:29:42.000 --> 02:29:44.080
I did meet my husband on LiveJournal.

02:29:44.080 --> 02:29:44.960
Those were the days.

02:29:45.000 --> 02:29:50.480
However, LiveJournal wasn't so easy to get on and use, you know, you still

02:29:50.480 --> 02:29:53.840
had to be a little bit of a nerd somewhat to be able to use LiveJournal.

02:29:54.840 --> 02:29:57.280
LiveJournal never really cracked the mainstream like that.

02:29:57.280 --> 02:30:00.400
LiveJournal never really had a functional mobile phone app.

02:30:00.800 --> 02:30:03.960
Yes, I know there was a I said a functional mobile phone app.

02:30:03.960 --> 02:30:05.280
So you all know what I mean.

02:30:05.280 --> 02:30:07.680
Facebook hit that perfect storm.

02:30:07.680 --> 02:30:10.360
And I think we've all been wondering, when's Facebook going to get replaced?

02:30:10.360 --> 02:30:11.600
Because I lived through LiveJournal.

02:30:11.600 --> 02:30:13.320
I lived through Zonga. I lived through Friendster.

02:30:13.320 --> 02:30:15.800
I lived through Myspace, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, all of it.

02:30:16.000 --> 02:30:18.800
But yet we wait for Facebook to go away and it never does because they

02:30:18.800 --> 02:30:22.120
hit that perfect storm of coming out when all the mobile phone

02:30:22.120 --> 02:30:23.440
stuff came out and all of that.

02:30:24.200 --> 02:30:25.440
Here's LiveJournal.

02:30:26.000 --> 02:30:26.280
Go ahead.

02:30:26.760 --> 02:30:29.120
Uh, yeah, Facebook, Facebook hit that, that perfect storm.

02:30:29.960 --> 02:30:33.360
I do agree with you that it's like, you know, yes, Facebook does reflect

02:30:33.400 --> 02:30:37.560
a lot of society's problems, but where Facebook has a real problem

02:30:37.560 --> 02:30:39.240
and Twitter has a real problem.

02:30:39.720 --> 02:30:45.320
There are artificialities being injected into normal people

02:30:45.320 --> 02:30:50.920
conversations that shouldn't be there, but they're artificially being pushed.

02:30:51.080 --> 02:30:54.160
And we know that through the whole, you know, Cambridge Analytica stuff

02:30:54.160 --> 02:30:56.800
that came up a couple of years ago out of Facebook through the advertising.

02:30:57.000 --> 02:30:58.520
And now we know this too.

02:30:58.520 --> 02:31:01.360
We know that Facebook is promoting content with the body

02:31:01.360 --> 02:31:02.560
positivity and all this stuff.

02:31:02.560 --> 02:31:05.640
Facebook thrives on this controversial content.

02:31:06.080 --> 02:31:10.920
Our conversations face to face might get heated, might get animated.

02:31:11.320 --> 02:31:18.520
They don't go to that place of straight up bullshit, unfounded bullshit, usually.

02:31:18.680 --> 02:31:22.040
Now, and now, now when they do, we think, well, yeah, sure.

02:31:22.040 --> 02:31:24.720
I have a lot of conversations with family members that are bullshit because

02:31:24.720 --> 02:31:27.360
they're reading it on Facebook because you don't have to be a

02:31:27.360 --> 02:31:28.920
real person to post on Facebook.

02:31:30.160 --> 02:31:30.520
Nope.

02:31:30.960 --> 02:31:33.800
It's become that easy to use.

02:31:33.840 --> 02:31:35.400
And that's the problem.

02:31:35.680 --> 02:31:40.280
Like I, I, it's, and I know I'm, I know I'm sounding like one of those crazy

02:31:40.280 --> 02:31:42.520
conspiracy, I sound like the art bell show right now.

02:31:42.520 --> 02:31:43.200
That's fine.

02:31:43.200 --> 02:31:44.280
I'll, I'll accept that.

02:31:44.760 --> 02:31:49.400
But the problem is foreign influencers have infiltrated Facebook.

02:31:50.000 --> 02:31:50.800
Period.

02:31:53.080 --> 02:31:55.040
And Facebook is not doing enough about it.

02:31:56.680 --> 02:32:01.320
And they're stirring the pot with all of this stuff because they can.

02:32:02.400 --> 02:32:05.520
I don't, I'm going to, I'm going to go there.

02:32:05.520 --> 02:32:06.400
Whatever I live there.

02:32:09.280 --> 02:32:13.360
You, you have a timeshare, all this vaccination misinformation and all

02:32:13.360 --> 02:32:15.320
this bullshit that's going on on Facebook.

02:32:15.520 --> 02:32:20.640
That is proactively encouraging people to not take the vaccine and die as a result.

02:32:23.200 --> 02:32:26.840
That is the result of foreign influence and people wanting

02:32:26.840 --> 02:32:28.560
to take down America a few pegs.

02:32:29.320 --> 02:32:31.840
I can counterpoint you with that very easily.

02:32:32.200 --> 02:32:32.560
Sure.

02:32:33.160 --> 02:32:35.240
Jenny McCarthy a decade ago.

02:32:36.600 --> 02:32:41.520
But even this isn't new, this isn't new vaccine misinformation and denial.

02:32:41.520 --> 02:32:42.800
This isn't any bit new.

02:32:42.920 --> 02:32:43.720
It's just lethal.

02:32:43.720 --> 02:32:48.320
Now, even, even her was amplified by Facebook though.

02:32:48.360 --> 02:32:52.440
Facebook's been around that long where I also associate a lot of here's the,

02:32:52.480 --> 02:32:54.520
here's the thing, yes, you're right.

02:32:54.520 --> 02:32:57.600
Jenny McCarthy and all that, you know, bullshit.

02:32:57.640 --> 02:32:59.800
And, and that from that years ago.

02:32:59.800 --> 02:33:00.600
Yes, absolutely.

02:33:00.600 --> 02:33:01.280
I'm with you there.

02:33:01.280 --> 02:33:02.240
That did exist.

02:33:02.600 --> 02:33:08.360
But again, Facebook amplified it because, and you know, I bet there were many people

02:33:08.360 --> 02:33:12.120
out there that had no idea who that woman was until Facebook started amplifying the

02:33:12.120 --> 02:33:14.880
message and people started sharing that on the social media.

02:33:15.000 --> 02:33:18.240
And we had those clickbait headlines that brought that stuff up to the forefront.

02:33:18.400 --> 02:33:23.200
And I even want to say, I could be wrong, but I feel like I've seen before Jenny

02:33:23.200 --> 02:33:27.800
McCarthy even saying, you know, I wish I wasn't the poster person for this anymore.

02:33:28.400 --> 02:33:32.680
I, I've, you know, I, I, I, I think I'm getting taken out of context a lot and

02:33:32.680 --> 02:33:33.120
stuff like this.

02:33:33.280 --> 02:33:38.120
She said things like that, but it doesn't matter because the narrative's already been

02:33:38.120 --> 02:33:39.080
written on social media.

02:33:39.280 --> 02:33:42.560
Like, I think, I think that's kind of like where it is for me is that you're right.

02:33:42.600 --> 02:33:47.760
Her perspective and her silly, and in, if I'll give you this too, like the flat earth

02:33:47.760 --> 02:33:51.440
and all that stuff that the concept of flat earth that's been around a long time.

02:33:51.440 --> 02:33:52.360
That doesn't hurt anybody.

02:33:52.400 --> 02:33:55.280
That's, that's also kind of true.

02:33:55.320 --> 02:33:57.760
The flat earth thing is just something we can all laugh at.

02:33:58.440 --> 02:34:02.120
You say you can, you're believing that it's not going to make you like die.

02:34:02.160 --> 02:34:05.840
You say it doesn't hurt anybody, but it killed rocket man.

02:34:05.880 --> 02:34:07.360
So, uh, all right.

02:34:07.400 --> 02:34:07.720
All right.

02:34:07.760 --> 02:34:08.640
There's at least one.

02:34:08.680 --> 02:34:09.000
All right.

02:34:09.040 --> 02:34:09.360
I'll know.

02:34:09.400 --> 02:34:09.920
I'll give you that.

02:34:09.920 --> 02:34:10.240
I'll get it.

02:34:10.440 --> 02:34:15.120
And I'm not suddenly saying like, but, but again, the Facebook and those types of

02:34:15.120 --> 02:34:18.000
platforms have made it easier for those people to find each other because it's so

02:34:18.000 --> 02:34:18.960
easy to get on Facebook.

02:34:18.960 --> 02:34:22.160
In fact, Facebook actively recruits you at a young age.

02:34:22.840 --> 02:34:22.960
Yeah.

02:34:22.960 --> 02:34:24.680
It's not so easy to build a rocket ship.

02:34:24.680 --> 02:34:28.800
So, you know, yeah, I am going to say that there is no forces

02:34:28.800 --> 02:34:30.560
dangerous on earth as belief.

02:34:32.520 --> 02:34:32.920
Anyway.

02:34:32.920 --> 02:34:35.600
So, Jason, Jason, I do, I do think you make valid points.

02:34:35.600 --> 02:34:37.240
I appreciate your perspective for sure.

02:34:37.680 --> 02:34:42.280
I do think there is, I think there is a Venn diagram of what you're

02:34:42.280 --> 02:34:43.160
saying and what I'm saying.

02:34:43.160 --> 02:34:44.880
And there is a very, very large overlap.

02:34:45.840 --> 02:34:46.200
Oh yeah.

02:34:46.240 --> 02:34:46.440
Yeah.

02:34:46.480 --> 02:34:51.000
Like we're, we're in, in the, in the, in the, what we want to see, uh, we are,

02:34:51.040 --> 02:34:54.520
you know, 90% overlap and we just kind of like kick out at the edges.

02:34:54.520 --> 02:34:55.520
And that's what we're talking about.

02:34:55.520 --> 02:34:56.680
Cause that's what conversation is.

02:34:56.680 --> 02:35:00.240
We don't, when, when two people are talking, they don't vehemently

02:35:00.240 --> 02:35:01.280
agree with each other.

02:35:01.280 --> 02:35:03.040
No, you're exactly correct.

02:35:03.040 --> 02:35:04.600
And this is why you're correct.

02:35:05.080 --> 02:35:07.920
So, you know, uh, it's social, social process.

02:35:07.920 --> 02:35:10.280
It's just, it's a, it's yeah.

02:35:10.280 --> 02:35:12.240
It's just a lot of, a lot of goings on.

02:35:12.240 --> 02:35:12.560
Yeah.

02:35:12.560 --> 02:35:16.600
I've had my, I had my fallout with a, uh, with the, with a anti-vax individual.

02:35:16.600 --> 02:35:21.240
I've had my political fallouts in particular, uh, only, only increasing

02:35:21.240 --> 02:35:25.520
as society, you know, as, as societal events happen and all that kind of stuff.

02:35:25.840 --> 02:35:30.440
I, I, I wish things were discussed differently.

02:35:30.480 --> 02:35:32.600
I couldn't tell you exactly how that is.

02:35:32.600 --> 02:35:36.160
This is the simplification and conversation effect.

02:35:36.480 --> 02:35:41.120
Um, we re we rail against the echo chamber, but there is a general

02:35:41.120 --> 02:35:45.000
mentality mindset of this channel and we have our own echo chamber.

02:35:45.560 --> 02:35:48.160
Uh, but yeah, it's all about scale.

02:35:48.160 --> 02:35:49.640
Everything is different at the high scale.

02:35:49.680 --> 02:35:52.920
Everything is different when every party is involved, uh, you

02:35:52.920 --> 02:35:54.440
know, and, and nobody is happy.

02:35:54.840 --> 02:35:58.120
I I'm, I'm not, I'm not saying anybody is wrong.

02:35:58.200 --> 02:36:00.000
Uh, I'm saying events happen.

02:36:00.320 --> 02:36:04.840
Uh, Facebook is right to be demonized to the extent that they have a hand in it.

02:36:05.240 --> 02:36:06.720
That's very hard to prescribe.

02:36:06.720 --> 02:36:09.760
And when you're, you know, when you're, when you're making a counterpoint, you

02:36:09.760 --> 02:36:14.480
don't say, well, I'll say 20% of the good things I like about you and the 80% that

02:36:14.480 --> 02:36:16.080
I disagree with, it doesn't, it doesn't work that way.

02:36:16.400 --> 02:36:19.600
I get it just kind of wanted to, wanted to, like I said,

02:36:19.600 --> 02:36:21.640
throw more than 15, 20 seconds out there.

02:36:22.000 --> 02:36:24.440
Fifth dream in chat says, I love this response.

02:36:24.640 --> 02:36:25.880
You're exactly right.

02:36:25.880 --> 02:36:27.520
You son of a wonderful lady.

02:36:30.160 --> 02:36:33.400
I hope your family is healthy for the knowledge that you imparted.

02:36:33.600 --> 02:36:35.240
I hope you all have a great day.

02:36:35.960 --> 02:36:37.360
Um, here's the thing here.

02:36:37.360 --> 02:36:38.440
Here it is at the end of the day.

02:36:39.400 --> 02:36:39.840
Go ahead.

02:36:39.880 --> 02:36:42.520
That's just a very moonlighting thing to say.

02:36:44.000 --> 02:36:48.640
Um, here's the thing I, and I, I'm not like, I don't criticize anyone for using

02:36:48.640 --> 02:36:51.520
Facebook, I get, I'm on Facebook, I post on Facebook.

02:36:53.040 --> 02:36:56.680
I, I would encourage everyone who's on social media to do this.

02:36:57.760 --> 02:37:01.240
Stop letting social media manipulate you.

02:37:01.960 --> 02:37:06.240
If you're about to get on a comment and type, fuck you, you fucking fuck.

02:37:07.320 --> 02:37:12.720
Stop and ask yourself, am I being manipulated to have this reaction?

02:37:13.560 --> 02:37:16.880
Is there something about this that is manipulating this conflict to happen?

02:37:17.520 --> 02:37:21.160
Cause if you really stop and kind of choose those types of responses

02:37:21.160 --> 02:37:25.160
appropriately, I think you might have an awakening as to what social media

02:37:25.160 --> 02:37:26.600
is really trying to invoke out of you.

02:37:27.000 --> 02:37:29.720
But you know what, if you're using Facebook to post pictures of the cat

02:37:29.720 --> 02:37:30.880
and what you're having for lunch.

02:37:31.080 --> 02:37:31.600
Cool.

02:37:31.720 --> 02:37:32.480
I love that stuff.

02:37:33.640 --> 02:37:34.920
Hide the post and move on.

02:37:35.400 --> 02:37:37.600
Don't, don't, don't feed, don't feed the monster.

02:37:37.600 --> 02:37:38.960
Don't feed the engagement machine.

02:37:39.720 --> 02:37:41.720
Seek out what you do want and not what you don't.

02:37:43.920 --> 02:37:44.280
All right.

02:37:44.480 --> 02:37:47.720
Bobby Blackwell says, on the other hand, please let VOG influence you.

02:37:49.960 --> 02:37:54.440
You know, I just post stuff about streaming and Dead by Daylight

02:37:55.000 --> 02:37:56.760
and Transformers fan art.

02:37:57.040 --> 02:38:01.120
And it's funny you say that because Mike Deff says, is Twitch the same though?

02:38:01.680 --> 02:38:03.440
In some ways, yes.

02:38:03.480 --> 02:38:06.920
I, and I, when I say any social media, I include Twitch in that.

02:38:07.160 --> 02:38:10.160
Ask yourself, am I being manipulated right now to have a

02:38:10.160 --> 02:38:11.480
particular reaction to something?

02:38:11.840 --> 02:38:16.480
Because I can always, I can always choose to not respond.

02:38:18.680 --> 02:38:22.960
Any service that puts something on you because we think you'll like it.

02:38:24.480 --> 02:38:26.720
Not that, you know, not that decisions happen in the void.

02:38:26.760 --> 02:38:28.000
It's all, it's all very complicated.

02:38:28.000 --> 02:38:31.520
This is a, this is an incredibly complicated topic and never, never

02:38:31.520 --> 02:38:32.840
solved because people are people.

02:38:33.400 --> 02:38:36.840
And we will continue this process into a, into eternity.

02:38:37.080 --> 02:38:38.960
And once we stop, somebody else takes it up.

02:38:39.000 --> 02:38:39.880
Cause that's how it works.

02:38:39.960 --> 02:38:43.360
Look forward to our future spinoff show, Orange Lounge Art Bellio.

02:38:45.640 --> 02:38:46.120
All right.

02:38:47.280 --> 02:38:47.800
Anyway.

02:38:48.240 --> 02:38:49.520
Uh, thank you, Jason.

02:38:49.560 --> 02:38:52.600
It was a lovely call and it's always good to hear from you and thanks for

02:38:52.600 --> 02:38:54.520
everything, thanks for everything you do.

02:38:54.560 --> 02:38:57.280
Um, the, those of you out there may not realize how much Jason

02:38:57.280 --> 02:38:58.440
does for Orange Lounge Radio.

02:38:58.640 --> 02:38:59.800
Yes, he does the voiceovers.

02:39:00.480 --> 02:39:05.360
Jason just saved me two minutes a week in pre-production today with a very simple

02:39:05.360 --> 02:39:08.240
thought of behind the scenes thing and how we transfer some of the

02:39:08.240 --> 02:39:09.720
intro files and all that stuff.

02:39:10.040 --> 02:39:12.640
Um, and it's one of those things where like, when you say it, it's

02:39:12.640 --> 02:39:16.160
like, why didn't we think of this very obvious thing before?

02:39:16.160 --> 02:39:19.440
And now it's like, Oh, and I just, I don't know if you saw the tweet I wrote,

02:39:19.440 --> 02:39:22.880
but I was like, it just goes to show, you can be doing something for 19 years

02:39:22.880 --> 02:39:24.280
and there's still ways to do it better.

02:39:24.720 --> 02:39:27.400
Yeah, we've been doing, we've been doing this particular process for

02:39:27.400 --> 02:39:28.640
what, two years and change now?

02:39:28.640 --> 02:39:31.800
And I've now saved you an hour every year.

02:39:32.040 --> 02:39:35.040
It, it's not to say it was bad or it was wrong.

02:39:35.040 --> 02:39:38.120
It got the job done, but now, you know, those two minutes a week that you're

02:39:38.160 --> 02:39:40.840
right, they'll add it that I will save an hour a year.

02:39:40.840 --> 02:39:43.880
That is an hour that I can spend looking at pornography.

02:39:43.920 --> 02:39:44.840
So thank you, Jason.

02:39:44.840 --> 02:39:45.320
I thank you.

02:39:46.080 --> 02:39:48.880
Also readily available on every corner of the internet.

02:39:48.920 --> 02:39:51.080
Just seek out, seek, seek out what you want.

02:39:51.080 --> 02:39:52.040
Not what people try to get.

02:39:52.040 --> 02:39:54.240
That they don't advertise to me on Facebook.

02:39:56.160 --> 02:39:57.880
All right, Jason, my friend, take care of everybody.

02:39:57.880 --> 02:39:58.320
Have a good night.

02:39:58.320 --> 02:39:58.600
Okay.

02:39:58.920 --> 02:40:00.120
Orange land radio people.

02:40:00.120 --> 02:40:00.960
You're wonderful.

02:40:00.960 --> 02:40:03.080
And I thank you for listening because you're wonderful.

02:40:03.080 --> 02:40:03.920
Son of a nice lady.

02:40:03.920 --> 02:40:04.920
Thank you for being here.

02:40:05.320 --> 02:40:06.600
How dare you be so cool.

02:40:06.960 --> 02:40:07.280
All right.

02:40:07.760 --> 02:40:08.480
Take care, buddy.

02:40:11.720 --> 02:40:12.600
Love to hear from him.

02:40:12.600 --> 02:40:13.280
We have another call.

02:40:13.280 --> 02:40:13.920
Let's get to it.

02:40:13.920 --> 02:40:14.880
We got calls tonight.

02:40:14.880 --> 02:40:15.360
I love it.

02:40:15.360 --> 02:40:15.560
Hi.

02:40:15.560 --> 02:40:16.400
You're on orange launch radio.

02:40:16.400 --> 02:40:16.880
Who's this?

02:40:20.240 --> 02:40:21.400
Rama.

02:40:22.120 --> 02:40:23.400
I can't hear anybody.

02:40:23.840 --> 02:40:24.760
We can hear you.

02:40:25.920 --> 02:40:26.240
Okay.

02:40:26.240 --> 02:40:26.920
He's got his hand.

02:40:26.920 --> 02:40:29.760
He's frustrated because he can't hear us, but we can hear him.

02:40:30.320 --> 02:40:34.320
I just, he's got to go to his discord audio settings output.

02:40:34.320 --> 02:40:35.640
What the heck is going on here?

02:40:36.640 --> 02:40:41.320
We'll just, we're going to just listen to a moment while DJ Rama S has a inner monologue.

02:40:42.400 --> 02:40:44.640
We could also play a joke and just not say anything.

02:40:45.520 --> 02:40:46.800
I don't think it's still broken.

02:40:47.320 --> 02:40:47.960
We could.

02:40:48.440 --> 02:40:53.160
How do I explain due to the unfreezing process that I don't have an internal monologue.

02:40:53.240 --> 02:40:54.560
Rama just said in chat.

02:40:55.240 --> 02:40:56.280
Uh, damn it.

02:40:56.320 --> 02:40:57.880
I'm sorry, y'all I'm out.

02:40:57.880 --> 02:40:59.200
Uh, that's okay.

02:40:59.840 --> 02:41:06.240
The depression is well, I hope whatever I DJ Rama S you nice person.

02:41:07.600 --> 02:41:09.640
How dare you contribute to our program?

02:41:11.120 --> 02:41:11.520
All right.

02:41:12.480 --> 02:41:13.840
Hopefully it'll get fixed for next time.

02:41:14.040 --> 02:41:15.200
Hey, let's check in.

02:41:15.200 --> 02:41:17.920
So I think I heard you say earlier, uh, dark soccer.

02:41:17.920 --> 02:41:22.960
There was no email, but all I can say is that, uh, there was no email, but all I can say is

02:41:22.960 --> 02:41:27.800
that, uh, there was no email, but all I can say is that, uh, there was no email.

02:41:28.840 --> 02:41:29.200
Okay.

02:41:29.600 --> 02:41:30.840
Uh, yeah, I love that.

02:41:30.880 --> 02:41:32.680
Uh, Jason with a good point there.

02:41:32.680 --> 02:41:35.560
If you want his opinions, listen to anime jam session.

02:41:35.600 --> 02:41:36.080
Very good.

02:41:36.080 --> 02:41:36.720
Love that plug.

02:41:37.120 --> 02:41:37.360
Love it.

02:41:37.360 --> 02:41:37.600
Love it.

02:41:37.920 --> 02:41:40.400
Um, let's talk about last minute stories.

02:41:40.400 --> 02:41:40.680
Loki.

02:41:40.680 --> 02:41:42.240
I don't know if you have anything you want to share with us tonight.

02:41:42.920 --> 02:41:43.720
Yes.

02:41:43.800 --> 02:41:49.880
The saga continues now, the saga being the Intellivision saga.

02:41:50.440 --> 02:41:53.800
So now they got an email, they sent me an email today and I ignored it.

02:41:53.800 --> 02:41:54.320
What happened?

02:41:54.880 --> 02:42:00.440
So today they announced that, um, even though the system isn't out yet, they are going to be selling

02:42:00.440 --> 02:42:06.240
the physical versions of the game, the games, or at least some of the games that you can purchase

02:42:06.240 --> 02:42:13.200
now, uh, for limited time bundles, ranging from $80 to $150 with, I think it was like four or

02:42:13.200 --> 02:42:14.640
eight copies of the games.

02:42:14.880 --> 02:42:18.600
I don't know if you can purchase these individually, but if you buy all eight, it's 150

02:42:18.600 --> 02:42:18.960
bucks.

02:42:19.360 --> 02:42:25.680
And what you get in those physical versions is basically the, like a manual, like our little

02:42:25.680 --> 02:42:27.160
card, that's a lenticular card.

02:42:27.200 --> 02:42:35.880
You get a collector coin and also the game itself, which is an RFID, um, card.

02:42:36.280 --> 02:42:41.280
But the thing that's unique about it and just it's buzzwords being thrown out, but apparently

02:42:41.280 --> 02:42:48.000
the card itself is like, it's like an NFT almost where in the sense that you it's a digital copy

02:42:48.040 --> 02:42:48.400
of the game.

02:42:48.400 --> 02:42:51.320
Cause there's really no physical games you can plug into the console.

02:42:51.320 --> 02:42:55.560
So when you scan it into your system, it basically ties that game to your system.

02:42:55.560 --> 02:43:03.080
But because of blockchain, you're then also able to later sell that copy to somebody else, another

02:43:03.080 --> 02:43:09.200
Amico owner, and then you can transfer that game using the blockchain and NFTs or something like

02:43:09.200 --> 02:43:09.440
that.

02:43:10.560 --> 02:43:11.240
Interesting.

02:43:12.240 --> 02:43:21.280
It's a neat way around the, uh, the, um, the whole digital thing, but at the same time, you're

02:43:21.280 --> 02:43:23.800
buying games for a console that's not out yet.

02:43:24.280 --> 02:43:27.880
Well, I, and Bobby does make a good point and this, uh, actually escaped to me.

02:43:27.880 --> 02:43:30.840
I did not realize today is 10, 10, 20, 21.

02:43:31.000 --> 02:43:35.680
This is the third release date of the, uh, television Amico, but I'm not, I'm not going to

02:43:35.680 --> 02:43:38.080
shade them for missing the release dates.

02:43:38.680 --> 02:43:42.880
Like there are other things that, you know, have been discussed, but as far as the release dates go,

02:43:42.880 --> 02:43:48.320
look, you still can't walk into a target and get a PlayStation five, you know, cars are hard, the

02:43:48.320 --> 02:43:49.760
chip shortage and all that stuff.

02:43:49.760 --> 02:43:51.480
It's real and it's affecting everything.

02:43:51.480 --> 02:43:53.280
So I'm not going to shade in television on that point.

02:43:53.640 --> 02:43:57.800
Um, they've had to delayed for several times now, so it is what it is.

02:43:57.800 --> 02:44:03.080
So that was a little thing they put out on this, um, third release date target that they've had to

02:44:03.080 --> 02:44:06.040
miss due to a fault that is legitimate.

02:44:06.160 --> 02:44:06.880
I think.

02:44:07.880 --> 02:44:08.200
Yeah.

02:44:08.680 --> 02:44:14.280
Um, I'm still wary, like I'll wait for this whole console to be released and come out and see the

02:44:14.280 --> 02:44:16.400
reviews and look at the games and stuff like that.

02:44:16.400 --> 02:44:24.960
I mean, you know, just, I just don't, I just not, no, no fault to Tommy here, but like NFTs right now

02:44:24.960 --> 02:44:28.440
are kind of a, it's just kind of a really shady gray area.

02:44:28.480 --> 02:44:34.560
There's a lot of, the intent with NFTs is to be able to pay like artists for some of these digital

02:44:34.560 --> 02:44:42.600
works, but there's a lot of people, celebrities and influencers exploiting this process to a really

02:44:42.760 --> 02:44:44.120
obscene degree.

02:44:44.120 --> 02:44:47.680
And so it's just kind of has a real negative connotation to it right now.

02:44:48.760 --> 02:44:52.640
And just to throw this in here and I get it the whole, it's not really an NFT.

02:44:52.640 --> 02:44:57.320
It's just more of like a way to be able to transfer ownership of a digital product, which is.

02:44:57.480 --> 02:44:58.280
I like it is.

02:44:58.400 --> 02:44:59.680
I like the way Bobby put it.

02:44:59.680 --> 02:45:04.360
It's only an NFT if it's from the nifty region of France, otherwise it's a sparkling blockchain.

02:45:04.400 --> 02:45:05.000
Yes.

02:45:06.040 --> 02:45:06.920
It's, you know what though?

02:45:06.920 --> 02:45:08.440
I, I, that's excellent.

02:45:08.840 --> 02:45:15.120
I, this is one of the better uses I've heard of it compared to a lot of weird shit out there.

02:45:15.120 --> 02:45:19.880
Like, did you hear the dark Sakura, not to keep shifting the conversation back to dead by daylight, but did you hear

02:45:19.880 --> 02:45:24.160
the whole thing about why those voice lines from dead by daylight for pinhead got removed?

02:45:24.440 --> 02:45:29.680
Because they wanted to do more stuff by like selling NFTs of that to enable it.

02:45:30.040 --> 02:45:32.120
Yeah, it was really wild shit.

02:45:32.360 --> 02:45:36.720
Like, and I hope, I hope that was somebody's fan fan stuff or whatever.

02:45:37.480 --> 02:45:42.760
If, yeah, well, I was trying, I'm still trying to get my head wrapped around the MMR.

02:45:42.760 --> 02:45:43.240
So whatever.

02:45:45.600 --> 02:45:45.760
All right.

02:45:45.760 --> 02:45:46.760
Anyway, sorry.

02:45:46.760 --> 02:45:48.480
Uh, Loki, I don't know if you had a further point with that.

02:45:49.040 --> 02:45:50.560
No, that's, that's about it.

02:45:50.560 --> 02:45:55.040
So yeah, right now you can buy the physical versions of, uh, eight different games.

02:45:55.040 --> 02:45:57.560
They have two paths of four or you can buy a pack of eight.

02:45:58.080 --> 02:45:58.600
Um,

02:45:58.600 --> 02:46:00.080
no, all right.

02:46:00.080 --> 02:46:05.840
I'm not going to be, we're going to go back to the, to be fair though, the box art's really nice.

02:46:05.840 --> 02:46:07.720
I do really like the boxes for them.

02:46:08.040 --> 02:46:09.640
Just no, no.

02:46:10.040 --> 02:46:10.480
All right.

02:46:10.480 --> 02:46:16.400
We're going to try this again because, uh, we actually had a call screener help and get, uh, all this trouble sorted.

02:46:16.680 --> 02:46:19.480
So let's try to welcome back to the program Rama.

02:46:22.360 --> 02:46:28.320
There is one thing I have told people, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never,

02:46:28.320 --> 02:46:31.200
never skimp out on your hardware.

02:46:31.560 --> 02:46:32.880
And that's what I did.

02:46:33.160 --> 02:46:35.040
I did not heed my own advice.

02:46:36.560 --> 02:46:36.880
All right.

02:46:36.880 --> 02:46:38.080
Well, what's on your mind tonight, buddy?

02:46:38.760 --> 02:46:38.960
All right.

02:46:38.960 --> 02:46:44.000
First, I just want to say your, your comment about Facebook and so forth for about engaging people.

02:46:44.040 --> 02:46:44.840
I'll make this very quick.

02:46:46.360 --> 02:46:47.960
That's part of the reason why I am in there.

02:46:48.040 --> 02:46:50.320
I talked to my therapist about stuff like that.

02:46:50.320 --> 02:46:57.920
Cause let's just say I just came off of another band because somebody made a comment about COVID and I

02:46:57.920 --> 02:47:03.120
called them out and I got put in Facebook state penitentiary for repeat jail.

02:47:03.160 --> 02:47:05.120
Yes, yes, I am.

02:47:05.360 --> 02:47:05.840
Yes.

02:47:05.920 --> 02:47:09.760
You frequent flyer stamp card for the Facebook jail, Rama.

02:47:10.840 --> 02:47:15.360
I have like the, like the little awards, like the little medals that they have, you know, when you're in the

02:47:15.360 --> 02:47:19.080
military, that, you know, but I, I do find it ridiculous.

02:47:19.120 --> 02:47:25.200
You get sent to Facebook jail and then there's all this other, but I'm exhausted on that point.

02:47:25.200 --> 02:47:26.560
So I'm just going to defer to you.

02:47:27.480 --> 02:47:28.280
Exactly.

02:47:28.320 --> 02:47:28.960
Thank you.

02:47:29.320 --> 02:47:31.000
But I didn't call in about that.

02:47:31.080 --> 02:47:33.360
I just want to talk about this whole Twitch thing real quick.

02:47:33.360 --> 02:47:37.560
Cause you know, I just find this thing absolutely hilarious.

02:47:37.920 --> 02:47:43.200
People losing their minds about these Twitch creators making so much money.

02:47:43.440 --> 02:47:47.400
Why are you mad that Twitch creators are making a million dollars?

02:47:47.600 --> 02:47:49.320
You made them rich.

02:47:49.440 --> 02:47:51.440
You threw them their money.

02:47:51.560 --> 02:47:52.920
You did all of this.

02:47:53.040 --> 02:47:54.960
I just sat there and watch you do it.

02:47:55.120 --> 02:48:01.200
But now you find out they're pulling a million five every month, somebody, and you want to be salty about that.

02:48:01.560 --> 02:48:03.200
You want to, are you ready?

02:48:05.200 --> 02:48:06.160
Hold on, hold on.

02:48:06.160 --> 02:48:08.120
Cause item number two will shock you.

02:48:08.320 --> 02:48:08.840
You ready?

02:48:09.440 --> 02:48:09.640
Yeah.

02:48:09.640 --> 02:48:09.880
Yeah.

02:48:10.120 --> 02:48:17.160
That's not all of the money they're making either because there are sponsorship deals that many of them have and will do

02:48:17.160 --> 02:48:19.520
sponsored content and will use certain equipment.

02:48:20.160 --> 02:48:21.000
So guess what?

02:48:21.000 --> 02:48:23.480
They're making more than that list that came out.

02:48:24.960 --> 02:48:26.000
And it gets to like that.

02:48:26.000 --> 02:48:28.720
You know, what's funny is the larger creator you become.

02:48:28.720 --> 02:48:34.480
So the more money that you're making and really don't need any of the free handouts, the more free handouts you get.

02:48:34.840 --> 02:48:38.280
So it's a nice problem to have, I guess.

02:48:38.360 --> 02:48:39.360
And then guess what?

02:48:39.360 --> 02:48:44.440
By, by putting out all this outrage about how you're so mad that so-and-so is making a lot of money.

02:48:44.600 --> 02:48:47.560
You are continuing to put their name out there.

02:48:47.560 --> 02:48:52.000
It's like that one YouTuber that constantly, and I don't care what his name is.

02:48:52.000 --> 02:48:58.800
You all know him, that one YouTuber that's always constantly doing stupid shit that always shows up because he's doing stupid shit.

02:48:59.240 --> 02:49:05.520
Honestly, I could probably be describing three different people, probably more, but anyway, go ahead, Ram.

02:49:05.520 --> 02:49:06.000
I'm sorry.

02:49:06.680 --> 02:49:08.680
Oh no, no, you're, you're absolutely right.

02:49:09.080 --> 02:49:12.040
This is one reason why I don't follow like the top 1%.

02:49:12.120 --> 02:49:15.200
I like the squad of people that I roll with.

02:49:15.240 --> 02:49:15.640
Okay.

02:49:16.000 --> 02:49:21.120
I hang out with Twitch streamers between one and a hundred.

02:49:22.520 --> 02:49:23.600
I'm good with that.

02:49:24.080 --> 02:49:32.840
But the main thing that had me rolling was the fans getting upset about how much money Critical Role was bringing in and get upset about that.

02:49:32.960 --> 02:49:33.560
Hold up.

02:49:33.760 --> 02:49:42.760
You have to understand at the beginning of the pandemic, a lot of voice actors could not go into the studio, so they weren't making any money.

02:49:43.320 --> 02:49:45.000
They're on Twitch doing things.

02:49:45.160 --> 02:49:50.200
Thank God for Steve Blue, who came up with a great idea for Critical Role, not Steve Blue, oh, Matt Mercer.

02:49:50.520 --> 02:49:51.680
He came up with this great idea.

02:49:52.000 --> 02:49:55.200
Voice acting friends putting it together and they're selling merch.

02:49:55.840 --> 02:50:05.720
They got sponsorships and everything, but also this is paying for their livelihoods and it's also paying for the equipment that they're doing to make this show.

02:50:05.920 --> 02:50:06.800
It's not cheap.

02:50:07.320 --> 02:50:08.120
Exactly.

02:50:08.400 --> 02:50:16.360
When I got my first quarterly dividend, you know, from, from Twitch streaming, I'll straight up say it.

02:50:16.720 --> 02:50:18.960
It's about $120.

02:50:18.960 --> 02:50:19.360
Okay.

02:50:19.760 --> 02:50:24.720
That's paid for my web hosting, my domains and everything for a year.

02:50:25.360 --> 02:50:25.960
And I'm good.

02:50:26.760 --> 02:50:36.680
Even if I didn't get that much, I'm like, okay, I'm so used to paying for stuff out of pocket because I do this for the fun of it.

02:50:36.720 --> 02:50:37.200
Okay.

02:50:37.200 --> 02:50:37.760
Hear it again.

02:50:38.000 --> 02:50:39.240
The fun of it.

02:50:39.560 --> 02:50:45.320
Oh, mostly Twitch streamers are doing this for the fun of it and they're giving back and they're doing this and doing that.

02:50:45.480 --> 02:50:50.840
The ones you got to look out for are the ones that are just in it for the money and don't give a damn about you.

02:50:50.920 --> 02:50:57.840
So if you're going to get upset about this one Twitch streamer making 2.5, guess what, my friend, they don't give a damn about you.

02:51:01.720 --> 02:51:10.520
Ladies and gentlemen, I'm leaving the show and just turning it over to Rama because that part that please go, please go back and watch the video on demand of this part of the show.

02:51:10.560 --> 02:51:11.680
Just that's all I'm going to say to you Rama.

02:51:12.120 --> 02:51:17.640
Um, like, yes, like it is Bobby, I know you're there.

02:51:17.720 --> 02:51:21.360
Um, how much are the legal zoom fees for VOG network for a year?

02:51:22.520 --> 02:51:29.960
Can you, can you let me know that because that is money that we're not paying out of pocket anymore.

02:51:30.200 --> 02:51:35.760
I know some of you are very sad that we left shout cast, but I can't tell you how nice it is that we're not paying.

02:51:36.320 --> 02:51:40.000
What was it was $120 every three months or something like that to run that thing.

02:51:40.000 --> 02:51:40.320
I don't know.

02:51:40.320 --> 02:51:41.080
It's been a while now.

02:51:41.560 --> 02:51:43.440
Um, we don't have to pay that out of pocket anymore.

02:51:43.760 --> 02:51:49.280
Um, and you guys are able to fund this through biddies and subs and all that, that when, okay, thank you.

02:51:49.280 --> 02:51:53.680
Bobby says it is, uh, taxes and legal zoom comes to 600 to $700 a year.

02:51:54.240 --> 02:52:03.120
The good news is your bitty and sub money means that Bobby Blackwolf, Rob Roberts and the rest of the company here at VOG network are not paying that out of pocket.

02:52:03.160 --> 02:52:03.720
Thank you.

02:52:04.520 --> 02:52:11.600
Thank you for legitimizing what we do so that when we want to do things like sponsor cons and, and, you know, do those types of, we can do that.

02:52:12.000 --> 02:52:19.040
So, you know, no, I'm not making a million dollars or anything like that, but we're able to do this fun thing.

02:52:20.920 --> 02:52:24.240
For free and it's cool to be, it's because of you guys.

02:52:24.240 --> 02:52:24.760
Thank you.

02:52:25.040 --> 02:52:33.000
Um, and, um, you know, there's some people on that list, like earlier in this, I don't think I necessarily want to dodge people just because they're popular.

02:52:33.120 --> 02:52:35.200
I name checked Pokimane earlier.

02:52:35.360 --> 02:52:36.120
I think she's great.

02:52:36.240 --> 02:52:39.360
I think she's, you know, and she's got a lot of great perspective on things.

02:52:39.600 --> 02:52:45.440
Now watch, I'm going to say that and somebody's going to find the cancelable statement, but as far as I know, she's, she's great.

02:52:45.440 --> 02:52:47.400
And she's a positive influence on Twitch and all that stuff.

02:52:47.400 --> 02:52:57.000
I'm happy for her, you know, and, and again, like if y'all are mad that these entertainers are making millions of dollars, wait until I tell you what actors and actresses make.

02:52:57.480 --> 02:53:18.680
Uh, but in the big Hollywoods and there, but you know what, for every ScarJo, for every Chris Pratt, for every, for any of those A-listers, there are people working at theaters, um, improv troops, uh, community related stuff.

02:53:19.520 --> 02:53:25.320
We've all heard the stories about waiting tables, trying out for reality shows and people that are for a reason.

02:53:25.440 --> 02:53:30.400
People that are trying to push that dream that are just having a problem breaking through that barrier.

02:53:30.800 --> 02:53:41.320
So now I think the only problem we need to address as a society and you're seeing it happen in Hollywood slowly, but it's happening.

02:53:42.360 --> 02:53:55.200
And you're going to see it soon on Twitch is going to be about now, why doesn't the high paid actors and actresses reflect the actual population makeup of this country?

02:53:56.320 --> 02:54:08.520
And that's now, I think the harsh reality a lot of us are looking at with Twitch is now here is the proof that at this time, only a certain group is widely successful on this platform.

02:54:09.920 --> 02:54:18.920
So that is that, but that is a, an issue much larger than our little, you know, bottom 99% show we have here on Twitch.

02:54:18.920 --> 02:54:42.920
Uh, She-Hulk 10 is suggesting O-L-R in a hot tub equals big money, do not tempt me because I want a hot tub to be in, uh, grandpa, grandpa, shut up, watch, uh, grandma, uh, grandpa Warcraft from Hoard House has a hot tub and has offered to do a hot tub stream.

02:54:42.920 --> 02:54:46.320
So look out, you might get it.

02:54:46.720 --> 02:54:58.720
Rob, I'm telling you this right now, if this is confirmed, I'm getting my best masks, I'm getting a round trip ticket, I will show up as James Brown or we can recreate that, that Saturday Night Live sti-

02:54:58.720 --> 02:55:00.720
James Brown hot tub party.

02:55:00.720 --> 02:55:02.720
Okay, we can do that.

02:55:04.720 --> 02:55:09.720
I just want you and grandpa to hang out IRL cause I think the two of you would just keep me laughing all fucking night.

02:55:09.720 --> 02:55:10.720
Like I wouldn't even have to drink.

02:55:11.120 --> 02:55:13.120
I will be, I, oh, trust me, you will be drinking.

02:55:13.120 --> 02:55:18.120
Um, I'm just, I just want a hot tub.

02:55:18.120 --> 02:55:19.120
We can make it happen.

02:55:19.120 --> 02:55:20.120
I love it.

02:55:20.120 --> 02:55:24.120
I love how I'm volunteering, but I c I could call him live right now and I'd be like, hey, we're coming up there next weekend for a hot tub party.

02:55:24.120 --> 02:55:25.120
He'd just be like, cool.

02:55:25.120 --> 02:55:30.540
Don't care. I love how I'm volunteering, but I could call him live right now, and I'd be like hey

02:55:30.540 --> 02:55:33.320
We're coming up there next weekend for a hot tub party. He'd just be like cool

02:55:35.860 --> 02:55:41.940
Actually one of my good friends who you've seen in my channel, I'm sure amethyst Rose, which she showed up in here, too

02:55:42.040 --> 02:55:48.040
Mm-hmm. Oh, yeah, I go use her hot tub good to own good. I'm wearing a webcam good times all right

02:55:48.040 --> 02:55:50.440
We're hitting the three-hour mark. I gotta wrap up the show. We're at nine o'clock

02:55:51.200 --> 02:55:53.200
People got shit to do

02:55:53.200 --> 02:55:55.480
Are you streaming tonight? I am okay?

02:55:55.480 --> 02:55:59.380
Well, then she probably wants to get started, and I gotta edit the show so Rama

02:55:59.380 --> 02:56:02.920
Thank you for being here any any quick other comment. You want to get out before we let you go

02:56:03.720 --> 02:56:05.720
the whole twitch thing I

02:56:05.800 --> 02:56:07.800
one thing say about that a

02:56:07.840 --> 02:56:14.800
Quote by one of the greatest wrestlers out there Booker T. Don't hate the play hate the game. That's all it is and on that

02:56:15.440 --> 02:56:17.440
But the players got to play the game

02:56:17.760 --> 02:56:20.560
Through it's a choice there you go

02:56:20.560 --> 02:56:25.920
That's exactly what it is and on that note. I will see you all next time take care Rama

02:56:26.520 --> 02:56:28.520
You're awesome all right

Last-minute stories Loki before I wrap it up

Not too much. Just it's the anniversary of
