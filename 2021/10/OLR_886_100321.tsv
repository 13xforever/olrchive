0	14600	Oh Konami, we wouldn't be here without you and we lament your continued decline in everything
14600	18920	except Imani. But now you're teasing new life in your largest franchises? Do I want
18920	24560	classic Konami remakes? Yes. Do I want new titles of classic Konami franchises? Castlevania,
24560	30280	Metal Gear, Silent Hill? Let's reserve judgment. This is the headline about the publisher that
30280	33560	catalyzed our collective. Now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Sommers and
33560	36440	Loki to tell you more about this and the rest of the week's gaming news. Starting right
36440	38440	now on the show where every gamer has a voice.
38440	45720	Hello my friends out there on the internet. Welcome back to another week of the show where
45720	52600	every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio and we are live once again with episode
52640	59840	number 886 of our show for tonight, October the 3rd of 2021. I can't believe it's spooky
59840	65040	season already, but happy Halloween a little early. My name is Rob Roberts and I'm here
65040	70520	with you every week and joined by my co-hosts. Say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Sommers.
70520	75040	You know Halloween season started on August 1st, right? Fair enough. Well, certainly by
75040	79440	the time I was enjoying a pumpkin spice latte, was it spooky season? And that was like Dragon
79440	84280	Con. That was like Labor Day. I have still not had one. Oh, you're missing out. Although
84280	89160	I'm not missing out. Yes, you are. As I've said on a previous episode, the apple drink's
89160	96880	pretty good too. I didn't have that because I hate caramel. Just get it without the caramel.
96880	102840	No, I like it in the chai. It's actually, it's too strong actually. It's too sweet.
102840	106840	So I'd have to have them do half as much. A lot of those, like even the pumpkin spice
106840	114760	latte, the thing I absolutely loathe about it now is that it is so sweet. I cannot, I
114760	118720	can't stomach it. It makes me nauseous. Try the cold brew with the foam because when
118720	122920	they mix together, the bitterness of the cold brew kind of helps I think with that. It's
122920	125920	a less sweet drink. Cold brew isn't supposed to be very bitter though. It does. It is to
125920	130960	me. Well, it's coffee, so it tastes a little bitter to me. The thing about cold brew, okay,
130960	135120	we're getting into coffee science and better put that aside. It's coffee talk. Let's talk
135120	143640	about a pumpkin spice latte. A cold brew is neither cold nor a brew. Discuss. It really
143640	151600	isn't a brew. It's like more like a steep. All right. Say hello as well to neither tech
151600	158800	nor master. Say hello to Loki, everybody. Hello. How are you, Loki? I don't like the
158800	164520	cold brew coffees. You don't really like coffee at all, do you? I'll drink like a wine mocha.
164520	173040	That's about it. So you don't like real chocolate either? I don't really like a lot of things.
173040	177920	I'm excited because Alan has to go run an errand. So he said on his way back he would
177920	183840	go by and I, especially if you're West Coast, like Northwest Coast, you know, this place
183840	188120	is crack. He's going by Dutch brothers on the way back. And that's like fucking love
188120	193720	Dutch to hell with Starbucks. Honestly, they're not paying me to say that. I love I always
193720	197460	get like the double mocha thing from them, even if it's going to make me super sick.
197460	202200	That much chocolate makes me happy. My favorite part of Dutch brothers is how they they make
202200	207440	their their locations way too small and don't account for any sort of traffic concern. Oh,
207440	213920	yes. Always a disaster. Everything everywhere. They're just a big pain in the ass. And so
213920	219880	it's just. Yay, Dutch brothers. And then everybody like has a stupid stickers on their car. And
219880	224400	it's like, what is this role? How do we take it? How do we take the concept of a Trader
224400	231000	Joe's parking lot and make it worse? Yeah. Yeah. Dutch brothers and Trader Joe's are
231000	237080	the same people. And I swear, it's just like the same crowd. My wife is part of that crowd.
237080	242160	I don't think she doesn't go to Dutch Brothers, but she sees the Trader Joe's crowd. And yeah,
242160	246140	they're special. All right. Anyway, we're here to talk about games, not about Dutch
246140	251460	Brothers and Trader Joe's, although you know, by the way, I bet Loki would like my dinner.
251460	256500	What did you have for dinner? It is steak and shells and cheese. Oh, good. Yum. I'd
256500	262040	like your dinner. Yeah, that was better than my, you know, one on the two month reminders
262040	266860	that McDonald's food is not good. We're good today. But I did it. It was just I didn't
266860	273180	have time. I wanted to go all the way down the Rancho to get this place they have. It's
274140	278260	like steak sandwiches, but they have like a beef dip there. That's pretty good. I want
278260	283700	to try that. But that's like all the way over in the Rancho. Or my other option was I want
283700	288160	to go to Burger King. But once again, for some stupid reason, we have a black hole of
288160	293840	Burger King in our area. And the closest Burger King is like 20 minutes away, one way or the
293840	297380	other from me. I was gonna say there's one like right near I mean, not to give away my
297380	302500	address on it, but there's one not far from the studio. So yeah, one of them's Yeah, it's
302500	307900	just I don't know for some reason. They don't have Burger King's around me. They have everything
307900	313940	else but not Burger King. Well, did get me chickie nugs from from the evil w come back
313940	320860	to this point for some good old times and you can go by Burger King on your way. Sure.
320860	327020	All right. The only fast food I really eat anymore is Del Taco. The one here. All right,
327020	333660	we gotta get to games. Look, fine episode. Jim boys is probably maybe you know what,
333660	337380	we haven't done a channel point reward in a long time. I think it was I think it was
337380	341860	Bobby's turn and then it just didn't happen. But he's gonna be taking a little time off.
341860	344780	So maybe we'll just have to do one again. And maybe we'll have to raise the channel
344780	350140	points for an all food like that, like the purpose will be orange lounge foodie. Oh,
350140	354420	and we will talk about nothing but food. I will have like 20 topics on food ready to
354420	361620	go and we'll we'll have food eleganza. Exactly. Category is food, all food and we'll play
361620	366380	we'll play power washing sim in the background just for the hell of it. We need to fucking
366380	373180	talk about power washing sim. But first, our kickoff topic for tonight. Let's go to a story
373180	376540	about Twitch. Well, why don't why don't we be self referential since we are doing our
376540	380620	show on Twitch, because we do tape live every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific nine o'clock
380620	386580	Eastern at the voice of geeks network, twitch.tv slash v o g network. Usually I would say we're
386580	390420	right after the Bobby Blackwell show. But as he announced earlier this evening, he's going to be
390420	395700	taking an unspecified amount of time off. I am having fingers and toes crossed the and full faith
395700	401100	that it's just going to be one week. Although the reality is it could be a little longer, but we're
401100	405060	just we're just going to err on the side of one week. And so we'll just we'll he'll just be taking
405060	409220	a little vacation and then be back in two weeks. That's that's where I'm going to set my mind and
409220	414340	positivity too. And if it doesn't turn out that way, then we'll deal with it later. All right. But
414340	418580	anyhow, Twitch, our kickoff topics about Twitch, let's get into it on Loki, you want to kind of
418580	419220	start us off here?
420180	428260	I would be the the thing we linked is the wrong story. So I am looking it up right now. But yeah,
428260	434620	basically, they've added some more functionality to Twitch chat to basically combat those bot
434620	436540	raids and whatnot. So
436820	438260	the verified account thing.
438540	446620	Yeah, so that's nice that they're finally doing some of that stuff. Is it enough? I guess we'll
446620	447500	wait and see.
447660	453020	It's been kind of interesting, though, in some of my other friends channels. I haven't seen as
453020	458980	much. Certainly I haven't seen the Haas show up as much in the last couple of days. The hose.
459780	465580	I've seen the hose show up just one or two here or there, but drop a follow. And I think part of
465580	466100	the problem
466100	471060	they're banned immediately. Well, I don't when I go to that's for sure. When I go to know when I
471060	475940	go to ban them, it says user doesn't exist. Oh, well, that's nice, I guess. But they started
475940	483940	putting words in front of hose. So the hose requests or Yeah, fun or, you know, crap.
483940	489140	So I don't know what those clowns are doing. But, you know, I do see them come through once in a
489140	494980	while. So but but it's nice that, you know, we can set the things on the chat. And we can set the
494980	501300	things with with that. But we can't change the follow because I would turn on the follow thing.
501300	505940	You know, and I realized that can kind of damage your follow base. But I I'm whatever like I would
505940	510020	turn it on so that you have to have a verified phone number to be able to follow. I don't think
510020	513860	it's that big of a deal that they're asking for. And definitely raid. That's the other thing.
513860	518580	They're not they're not doing anything the actual like hate raid when you get a bunch of these,
518580	523860	you know, hose to suddenly raid and their icons and stuff that are coming through are all
523860	531700	disgusting images that that's not really done yet. But I for what it's worth, I haven't personally
531700	536500	seen it happen to a channel in a little bit. So everything I'm hearing is anecdotal. And I don't
536500	541540	know if it's been happening since and maybe chat. You can set me straight because y'all are or set
541540	546660	me gay, whatever you prefer. But send me in the chat whichever way I should be going over at
546660	552580	twitch.tv slash vogue network on if you've seen one of these in the past couple days or heard
552580	556900	about this happening since Twitch actually did these changes. That's what I would be curious
556900	563220	about. Yeah, I'm fifth dream. Oh, sorry, go ahead. Is that something that you toggle on in your
563220	568660	stream manager? Because I'm not seeing it in mine. It is there. It's kind of you have to go on to
568660	576100	your dashboard settings and moderation and then or mods can do it via chat manage moderation settings.
576100	581380	And then you can toggle the phone or email verification required for all accounts first
581380	586820	time chatters, chatters with the couch is less than and they have like certain criteria up from
586820	593060	one day to six months, or even like one hour chatters following for less than pre filled up,
593060	597860	they have like 10 minutes, 30 minutes, all the way up to three months. So you can add all that.
598580	605220	You can also exempt VIP subscribers and mods and whatnot. I think that's good that they have all
605220	612340	that stuff in there definitely will slow them down. Yeah, but and just some free advice you
612340	617700	didn't ask for for Twitch streamers and up and coming Twitch streamers. Never ever, ever, ever
617700	623700	set your channel to followers only mode, unless it's a result of one of these raids. And it's the
623700	628100	only thing you can do about it. Hopefully these options will make it so that you don't need to do
628100	634660	that. But I would say like setting your it so so obviously, you know, because I don't want to get
634820	639060	the email that's like, you're insensitive and rude, Rob, because you haven't had to deal with
639060	642980	as many of these and I have to turn it on. Okay, yeah, if you're doing it as a response to these,
642980	647460	I'm sorry, you have to do that. Because that is one of the worst things you can do to your channel
647460	652980	to stifle growth, in my opinion. Never turn on followers only mode because you're not encouraging
652980	660180	discussion with new potential awesome people. And then you can't like- Following is free.
660180	664820	Yeah, following is free. Well, yeah, you should follow channels that you're watching. But,
664820	667860	you know, sometimes people want to have a little bit of engagement or whatever it is.
668420	674020	I just think turning on followers only mode, you're putting up a wall and then somebody just,
674020	678020	you know, it's like, I don't want to follow, I'll just go to a different channel. You know,
678020	682740	I'm not that I'm not I'm not that motivated to say something. You want to encourage the
682740	689060	participation as easy as possible. You don't want to make it even one button and an alert,
689060	694260	which some people don't want to have the alerts. I follow channels purposely when they're not live
694260	700420	so that I don't do an alert so that it's just like outside. This is what it is. So-
700420	706100	See, I like when people follow or sub while I can see it so that
707380	711060	I can give them a shout out and thank them. Sure. Not everybody wants to be seen though.
712660	716660	You know, it just depends on the preference of the viewer and so forth.
716660	719940	Yeah, but sometimes it makes the streamer feel good.
719940	722420	Sure. To witness it and know that it's happened.
723380	727940	Let's see. Mike Deft in chat is kind of agreeing, saying, yeah, people do tend to go away
728580	734180	if they see an obstacle, even as simple as just a click. And Mike Deft continues, ads suck more
734180	741060	though. Yeah, I really think that feature that Twitch added where it automatically plays ads.
741060	745060	I mean, if you're dropping an ad because you're going to pee anyway and you're not going to be
745060	749780	there for two minutes, that's one thing. But the one that like I've been to channels now that just
749780	755140	automatically play the ads every 30 minutes. And it's so like I tune right out. Like if I feel
755140	758500	like they're talking and I'm missing something, I forget it. I'll just go somewhere else.
760020	764340	But I won't like if somebody's like it because I've done it. I've run an ad when I've gotten up
764340	768580	to pee because I know nothing's going to happen on my channel for two minutes, but an AFK screen.
768580	772020	So it's like, all right, whatever. I'm not like hurting anything or stifling discussion.
772580	777140	So and I'm getting rid of pre-roll ads, which is another important thing. So,
778820	785380	well, I actually do that when when I go for one of my many bathroom breaks, I usually run an ad.
785380	791060	Sure. But that makes sense to do it. And make two whole cents. Yeah. Let's see,
791060	796020	Zen Monkey 11 in chat says they should have a hide button for subs so they can choose to be seen or
796020	801620	not. You know, technically that exists because you only actually push the sub notice through
801620	805620	when you check that bot. And some people have said, Rob, why don't you why didn't you read
805620	809620	my shout out at the end of the stream? I didn't see it. You didn't you didn't let that little
809620	816660	chat thing go through to put a gun to your head to announce it in chat. Like every time I like
816660	822100	close, close, close. No, listen, you do it. You're going to announce your subscription. Yeah,
822100	826740	that's the other thing is I'm like, how did you get that to go away? Because I never can.
827620	832580	No, it's crazy. Yeah, it's like, it's like, sorry, you can't do anything until you announce your sub.
832580	841300	It's like, okay, thanks. Bonds 006 in chat says I followed 26 channels lurk in 22 of them. I'm
841300	847300	tuning in to give the person the numbers. I literally lurk in 90% of dark soccer's DVD games.
847300	851140	Not to speak for dark soccer when she's right there, but I'm gonna guess she doesn't mind if
851140	856900	you lurk because it's still a view. So yeah, yeah. So and because that's how I feel too.
856900	864180	And again, view numbers are weird anyway. Like I it'll say three people are watching and then
864180	870660	it's got like 50 people lurking. Yeah, that's why that's why I just learned to stop looking
870660	876420	at those numbers like because they're not right half the time anyway. But I would also say a
876420	880980	really big no no as a streamer. Do not shout out random people in chat that you know are there.
881540	887620	Like, there are very specific circumstances that might be okay. Like, for example, like, you know,
887620	892340	oh, we're gonna bring up Pokemon is Shane in chat. Let me look at the chat list. Oh,
892340	897060	that's different. Because, you know, we've been friends for years and you know, whatever,
897060	901300	he knows I'm going to call him out. If I ever bring up a Pokemon topic, and that's a compliment.
901300	905860	But again, sometimes people just want to lurk, they just want to idle and they don't necessarily
905860	909940	want to participate. They just are having the content in the background. So to call them out
909940	916340	can always feel really awkward. So anyway, all right. Um, anyway, this was not unsolicited Twitch
916340	922180	advice hour, it was responding to some of these news items. But I think there's more right, Loki?
922180	924500	Well, it did help me out, by the way. Thanks. Thanks, Loki.
925460	932500	So there is also more and this is kind of, I don't necessarily like where this is going,
932500	939300	but it's basically this new service that they're testing right now. It's called boosting.
939300	948980	And what it basically does is allows you to pay for recommendations to other people. So for
948980	955620	example, they have like a screenshot here showing that they're paying about 297 for 3000
955620	961700	recommendations. So I guess it blasted out to it pops maybe your channel on their recommended
961700	968500	feed on the side there. I'm not really sure what that's about. But yeah, apparently it varies in
968500	974980	cost depending on how many recommendations you're looking to Facebook does that.
977140	982580	I don't necessarily like that. That's kind of pay to win at that point. But I don't know.
983380	987300	I think that's exactly what Facebook does for your for personal pages.
987860	992740	The response on Twitter has been very interesting to this because I've seen a lot of streamer pals
992740	997780	and friends that are tweeting like, if you are a fan of my stream, please do not do this.
999300	1005460	I'm not so sure I'm apt to tell people not to do this. Because at the end of the day,
1006020	1010340	it's your money, spend it how you want. If you're going to spend money on a mediocre way
1010340	1015300	to boost the visibility of VOG Network or one of our personal streams, of course, I'm not going to
1015300	1022500	stop you. Like, maybe it'll work. Yay, who knows? But I think there's just a lot of us going, we
1022500	1026980	don't get a cut of that. And so there's a lot of us going, the money would be better spent on a sub
1026980	1032580	or biddies because we actually get some of that money. And we'll spend it on advertising in other
1032580	1037860	ways like buying a booth at a convention where we can talk to people face to face or getting more
1037860	1043620	flyers or merchandise made that we can take to conventions and other live spaces. I think that
1043620	1050180	is kind of why people are urging people to go the other direction with this. It would be nice maybe
1050180	1056100	if Twitch had a boost slash, you know, donate or tip the streamer type of thing. And then maybe
1056100	1062020	people wouldn't feel so opposed. But again, I'm not going to take a hard line on that. If you feel
1062020	1067460	generous enough to boost VOG Network, again, I don't think it's the best way you could spend the
1067460	1074100	money. But I'll be curious if it works. And I'll be thankful that you tried, I guess. So that's
1074100	1081860	how I kind of feel. Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, that's why I don't like the Discord Nitro system.
1081860	1087540	Just let us pay to get the boosted perks instead of forcing our users to do so. Yeah, I'm not a
1087540	1092660	huge, huge fan of that either. But I do like that a server can be boosted a pretty decent amount
1092660	1099700	with just one person. And so the VOG Network Discord is boosted thanks to yours truly. I think
1099700	1105060	somebody else actually boosted so I can't take all the credit anymore. But maybe Bobby did it too,
1105060	1111620	actually. But yeah, I mean, I was the first I know that that got us boosted there. So I mean,
1111620	1116740	it's gonna take like 50 boosts to get to the next level. Yeah, don't do that. Don't don't spend the
1116740	1121700	money to do that. Like yeah, I agree with Bobby. Let us pay to do it. And maybe we will. Who knows?
1122260	1126340	Yeah, Mike Deff says I'd rather give you guys the money directly. Thank you. We'll take it.
1126340	1131300	Although remember, we don't ask for money to do this show. Like all the tips and things you guys
1131300	1135940	give. And I did notice the hype train earlier. Thank you guys very much for that. You really,
1135940	1141460	really don't have to do those types of things. But since you did, we'll use the money to keep
1141460	1145540	our business legitimate and to help spread the word and try to grow our family a little bit.
1146340	1149300	And, you know, it'll be nice when conventions come back and we can do that more.
1149300	1153860	Dude, no more selling the black market knockoff video games?
1155460	1158420	Well, that's kind of what Loki's doing with Pixel Poops.
1158420	1161780	Yeah, but that's a legit game.
1161780	1162280	It is.
1163380	1167380	I mean, like, you know, 50 million in one cartridges.
1168420	1170260	Yeah. Oh yeah, those. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
1170260	1172020	Selling them out of the boot of my Fiat.
1173940	1179140	So yeah, again, the boosting thing is interesting. I'm not sure it's going to have much success,
1179140	1183780	but I think it just also shows like, I don't know a nice way to put this,
1183780	1188020	so I'm just going to say it bluntly. It shows how desperate Twitch is to make money right now.
1188420	1194740	Is that they're allowing the content creators to essentially buy advertisements.
1194740	1196900	Do you know what I would be interested in buying?
1196900	1200180	Hey, Twitch, hey, let me give you some advice. You didn't ask for it.
1200180	1204660	Here's what I would be interested in buying, provided it's priced reasonably,
1204660	1206900	perhaps for my own channel, perhaps for other channels.
1206900	1211220	I would be interested in buying something that removes the ads from my channel for everybody.
1212500	1215940	There's no more ads on my channel and maybe I'll pay like whatever,
1216180	1219540	15 bucks a month, whatever, you know, you want to set.
1219540	1221300	I'll pay it to get rid of ads completely.
1222660	1227460	But I'm tired of having to pay that much in all of the people I'm subbed to.
1227460	1228100	Oh, right.
1228100	1229620	And I'm subbed to a lot of people.
1229620	1234100	I was going to say, I see you in a lot of channels.
1234100	1236660	Well, no, I can be in a lot of chats and follow them.
1236660	1238180	I'm talking about the subs I have.
1238180	1239860	I see you subbing to a lot of channels.
1240580	1244980	And I need to apologize to those friends and take a step back.
1245620	1246100	I don't.
1246100	1248100	You know, I don't think you need to apologize to anybody.
1248740	1255540	And no one, no one should expect a sub from anyone, because that's when
1256340	1257300	you should all sub to me.
1257300	1258900	I'm kidding, kidding, kidding.
1258900	1263380	That's when Twitch turns into a pyramid scheme, basically.
1263380	1267460	And this was this was the exact same criticism I had a Patreon for.
1267460	1273220	And I in some ways I still do is that there is a social pressure
1273780	1278020	that if I donate to this Patreon, you need to donate to my Patreon.
1278020	1279140	So what are we doing?
1279140	1282340	We're giving each other money and letting Patreon take a cut of it.
1282340	1284740	That is the exact same thing that happens
1284740	1289140	when Twitch people feel a requirement to sub to each other's channels.
1289140	1292100	All you're doing is amazoning Twitch.
1292100	1292660	Yeah.
1292660	1296020	It's basically the whole thing is Amazon's scheme right there.
1296580	1297380	It's an MLM.
1298260	1299940	Is what Bond's 006 says.
1300020	1308580	Anyway, Bobby Blackwoven chat says, I thought Twitch turbo removes ads used to be prime gaming
1308580	1311860	used to be that way until it will on one channel.
1312900	1315540	The one that you're subscribed to with your free subscription.
1315540	1320580	But other than that, yeah, you can just tell that Twitch is desperate to make money.
1321300	1323620	And I don't know.
1323620	1325780	There's a part of me that's starting to worry.
1325780	1331300	I'm going to be honest that Twitch, Amazon may think about cutting Twitch off at some
1331300	1333060	point if they're not making enough money.
1333060	1333560	I don't know.
1335620	1341700	So anyway, on that happy friendly note, let's move on to our gaming weeks and we're going
1341700	1344660	to talk about the types of video games that we have been playing this.
1344660	1349220	Oh, Bobby Blackwoven says Twitch turbo still gives you an ad free viewing across Twitch.
1349220	1350580	I didn't even know that was a thing.
1350580	1351220	I thought that.
1351220	1353300	Yeah, I thought that went away with prime gaming.
1354020	1355700	Let Loki go first, by the way.
1355700	1356200	What's that?
1358020	1359700	Let Loki go first so I can finish chewing.
1360740	1364180	Okay, let me go to Loki and talk about gaming weeks.
1364180	1365380	Loki, how was your gaming week?
1366020	1371460	Yeah, so I played Minecraft and I was doing video editing for that as well.
1371460	1375780	Still, I'm actually I was going through time lapses because I broke my time lapse up into
1375780	1380580	about 12 parts because I had like several different sessions that I built stuff in.
1381380	1384740	So I'm actually thinking about just cutting out the time lapse because it's not that interesting
1384740	1385220	anyways.
1385220	1386740	And then that'll save me a whole bunch of time.
1386740	1391460	I put my episode out, which should have been out last week, but, you know, took longer
1391460	1393540	than anticipated, as usual.
1394660	1399540	And then, of course, I played more power washing sim.
1399540	1409940	So now I'm all the way through like I'm on the Hansel and Gretel cottage thing, which
1410020	1410980	is interesting.
1410980	1414420	And then I just finished up the skate park, which is pretty big.
1416100	1420180	I just bought the the the best power washer in the game.
1420180	1424980	And yeah, it's it's still something I keep playing.
1424980	1426340	It's a good, good.
1426340	1428100	I don't want to think about anything.
1428100	1434340	Just let my mind go to mush game where you just power wash.
1434340	1439060	And I didn't realize that like the R key actually rotates the power washer adapter, which I
1439060	1442420	wish I had figured that out at the beginning, because I know like on the keys, they have
1442420	1445860	it mapped to like X and C is supposed to like rotate through stuff.
1445860	1451300	But I thought that actually would like rotate your sprayer, but it never seemed to do that.
1451300	1453620	But yeah, R does that apparently.
1453620	1454180	And so that.
1454180	1454820	Oh, my God.
1454820	1455300	Noted.
1455300	1458580	I was trying to use that today and I'm like, I thought Z and X was supposed to rotate the
1458580	1458980	gun.
1458980	1459220	Yeah.
1459220	1460900	So it's R R does.
1460900	1462900	Yeah, it'll rotate at 90 degrees.
1462900	1470900	So it's yeah, that helped me out a lot with, you know, being able to spray in different
1470900	1471860	directions and stuff.
1471860	1473060	So, yep.
1474980	1475700	So that's it.
1475700	1477060	That's what I played this week.
1477060	1477540	All right.
1477540	1478740	Let's see if our soccer is ready.
1478740	1480020	Your gaming week, our soccer.
1480020	1486180	Um, I picked up a couple of games for a certain somebody in my house's upcoming birthday on
1486180	1486980	the following month.
1487780	1491540	Um, I will not say what they are in case he is listening.
1492260	1496500	Um, I bought a game and ended up getting a different game.
1496500	1498180	And then the person sent me the right game.
1498180	1502020	So this is the game I ordered, which is peel peel for Super Famicom.
1503140	1506260	I also got sent, um, puzzle day pawn.
1507060	1511300	So yeah, first for the podcast, folks, she's holding up the cartridges.
1511300	1513060	So she's this is a show and tell.
1513700	1517460	I mean, really, I was only out four bucks in general, but the person was really nice
1517460	1519300	about it and they get some good games in.
1519300	1522500	So, um, but it was like through Makari or something.
1522500	1524260	Um, it's a puzzle upon.
1524260	1526900	That was the one that was on the Neo Geo as well.
1528020	1532420	Um, or is that different games on his Tetris attack and Pokemon Puzzle League, right?
1533140	1533460	Yeah.
1533460	1534100	Yeah.
1534100	1534820	Okay.
1534820	1534980	Yeah.
1535860	1536580	I'm not mad.
1536580	1537860	Puzzle day pawn is fun.
1537860	1538500	Yeah, yeah, it is.
1539220	1539380	Yeah.
1539380	1542500	Cause they have a game called puzzle day pawn on the Neo Geo.
1542500	1544260	That was like bust a move.
1544260	1546660	So, uh, I used to, I used to play it.
1547300	1548100	Tunnel day pawn.
1549220	1551940	No, they call it puzzle the pawn in, on the Neo Geo.
1551940	1555140	I know it's should be like paneled upon, but it's puzzled upon.
1555140	1558740	I, I promise you, I played it all the time when I worked at round table.
1558740	1561140	That's one of the four Neo Geo games that we had.
1562340	1563620	Mandela effect in action.
1564340	1566260	It is not the Mandela effect in action.
1566260	1567780	I guarantee it is.
1567780	1568100	Okay.
1568100	1568980	Puzzle day pawn.
1568980	1573460	Maybe that might've been the name for us distribution.
1575220	1575940	No, it's right here.
1576260	1578580	SNK and Taito puzzle day pawn.
1579780	1581220	I am not insane.
1581220	1581620	All right.
1581620	1582660	Bob and Bobby.
1582660	1583540	Bobby's confirming.
1583540	1584660	He Googled it.
1584660	1585140	You're right.
1585780	1586180	All right.
1586180	1586580	All right.
1586580	1586980	All right.
1586980	1587300	Chat.
1588260	1589460	Chat says, Loki's right.
1589460	1589780	Fine.
1590340	1590660	Come on.
1590660	1591860	We were trying to gaslight him.
1591860	1594020	You guys let us have fun.
1594020	1594580	I'm just kidding.
1594580	1596660	I, I really did that.
1596660	1597940	Maybe I'm the one.
1597940	1599460	Wasn't Nintendo published.
1601940	1603300	So interesting.
1604020	1605300	Puyo Puyo was Bonpresto.
1606180	1606500	Anyway.
1607620	1612980	Um, so there's that, um, I've also been watching a lot of people play new world.
1612980	1619940	And if I figured out, I can't, it will not run on a windows arm, which is the version
1619940	1621380	I have to run in parallels.
1621380	1628260	So I can't do it unless I install one of those, uh, uh, motherboards in my old PC,
1628260	1633540	uh, whenever I can get some time to and upgrade my graphics card and get a better hard drive.
1633540	1638820	Cause it's, it's kind of just like, oh, I don't want to do anything.
1638820	1641140	And then that way I'll leave it on steam link it.
1641140	1642100	And I'm fine.
1642100	1642600	Yeah.
1642980	1649380	I have been able to steam link a lot of stuff, honestly enough through, uh, my, uh, windows
1649380	1649880	arm.
1650580	1654340	So like whenever I want to use, uh, like source filmmaker.
1655220	1661620	I I'm playing, I'm doing it like in my Mac build, but it's streaming from my little,
1661620	1663940	you know, virtual windows.
1663940	1664980	So weird.
1665700	1672420	Um, I'm also, uh, um, I am playing a lot of dead by daylight.
1672420	1679300	Uh, I played a lot of dead by daylight, um, when I did that marathon and I'm doing another
1679300	1684740	marathon, 14 hours of dead by daylight, 13 hours, 13 hours, lucky 13, because I had to
1684740	1686500	be stubborn and make it one more hour.
1686500	1688420	And then I'm like, okay, I can't do this anymore.
1689300	1697300	What I have learned from this, no one plays dead by daylight at 4 AM or five or six, just
1697300	1697800	saying.
1698340	1706420	Um, my next one is going to be, uh, for, uh, well, I've mentioned my, my lesbian moms,
1706420	1706920	right?
1707300	1708420	A while ago on the show.
1708420	1712340	It's been some time, but I know this just from knowing you for so long.
1712340	1715940	I'm not sure every listener's heard this of these individuals before.
1716820	1723300	When I had just started college, um, I was taken in by some very dear friends of mine.
1723940	1730340	Um, and I always refer to them as my mama son and my papa son, um, not to be confused
1730340	1736900	with furniture, but, um, they, they really took good care of me at a time when I desperately
1736900	1737540	needed it.
1737540	1744340	And I was in a really, really bad spot, just, you know, mentally, I was unmedicated and
1744340	1745940	didn't know I was autistic at the time.
1746580	1748900	Um, so they took me in, they took care of me.
1748900	1751700	They've been there for me for some pretty major stuff.
1751700	1754580	They're actually the people who introduced me to Dan.
1755380	1763940	So, um, funny enough, uh, back in the day, um, my, uh, Dan's old AOL screen name was
1763940	1772660	dark ryoga and, uh, uh, and, uh, uh, papa son had a ryoga screen name as well.
1773460	1776020	And then I, mine was dark Uchon.
1776020	1779380	So it was pretty, pretty funny.
1779380	1782660	Um, and by the way, people don't whisper me during this show, please.
1782660	1791060	Um, it was just really funny that, um, that I met Dan that way and I had actually met
1791060	1792500	my friend Julie before that.
1793060	1798340	Um, in the sailor moon AOL chat room, but, uh, I didn't know that Julie and Dan were
1798340	1799220	friends at the time.
1799220	1805140	So, but anyway, um, so, you know, I moved to California every time I'd go back, I'd
1805140	1807300	have to go see them and hang out with them.
1807300	1815220	And so, uh, to put things forward now, um, uh, papa son has been, uh, recently diagnosed
1815220	1817060	with cancer, like a few days ago.
1817780	1825060	Um, had, I also heard that she had her first, uh, chemo treatment today and is feeling pretty
1825060	1825860	beat up by it.
1826740	1834180	Um, and, uh, I want to do something to give back to them.
1834180	1839140	I don't really have like a whole lot of bonus money right now.
1839140	1842980	Um, which is why I'm trying to, you know, dial back my Twitch stuff.
1843700	1849220	Um, but I figured I do have kind of have an audience, you know, I get people in from time
1849220	1853620	to time and I'm pretty good at making friends and I have friends who would support me in
1853620	1853860	this.
1854500	1862180	So, um, I'm doing another marathon, um, not tomorrow, Monday, but next Monday on the 11th.
1862180	1863860	Um, I'll link stuff in the chat room.
1863860	1865700	I would greatly appreciate some support.
1865700	1872900	I'm doing it from 11 AM to 11 PM Pacific time, um, which I figured would accommodate our
1872900	1877380	West coast and East coast and maybe some of our Australian people.
1877380	1884420	Cause that would be going into the, the late afternoon for them and maybe some of our UK
1884420	1886900	people earlier in the day, you know, get them in the evening.
1886900	1888180	Probably going to work out at some other time.
1888180	1888420	Yeah.
1889060	1889540	Yeah.
1889540	1892980	Um, and it also means I still don't have to get up before 10 AM, so that's good.
1893620	1900820	Um, but, uh, I really want to give back to Barbara.
1900820	1904260	Barbara has been an amazing, just an amazing human being in general.
1904980	1910180	Um, a delight, delightful human, uh, has always taken good care of my mom and son.
1910180	1915620	They take good care of each other and just one of my absolute dearest friends, my chosen
1915620	1916020	family.
1916660	1920420	And I mean that in the truest sense of chosen family.
1921700	1925780	So I would appreciate if everyone would help me.
1925780	1929220	Well, let me know how I can help besides just, um, trying to get the word out.
1929220	1931460	So, um, you know, if you want, there is a GoFundMe.
1932100	1932580	Okay.
1932580	1940020	And I'll put the links for that in there, but I will say that if you, um, for friends
1940020	1948820	who donate before the marathon, your amount, your donations will count toward the, the
1948820	1949380	giveaways.
1950340	1955540	So, um, I will make sure that that information gets, uh, LinkedIn chat.
1955540	1958660	Cause you know, y'all, y'all have all helped me.
1958660	1960740	People in the community have been really great to me.
1961460	1966340	And, uh, I want to, I also want to provide some entertainment in the form of me complaining
1966340	1967140	about survivors.
1968340	1968660	All right.
1968660	1970820	There is a $5,000 goal.
1970820	1974100	If I can hit $5,000, I will play survivor.
1974820	1975300	All right.
1975860	1976980	I'll be in a Swift with y'all.
1976980	1979140	That's a big goal, but it's a good, it's a good cause.
1979140	1982020	Like if you're going to raise $5,000 for anything, this is the reason.
1982020	1984180	And I might lower that to three.
1984820	1985220	All right.
1985780	1991940	Well, anything else for your gaming week, dark saga?
1992820	1996580	Um, a little bit of pinball, played some pinball world cup.
1997380	2002900	Um, harass the cat, harass the cat is my favorite game.
2002900	2003400	Really.
2004100	2006260	Is it you harassing the cat or the cat harassing you?
2006900	2008020	I don't know what her deal is.
2008020	2009140	Maybe she's just getting old.
2009140	2014340	Cause she's going to be 10, um, around my birthday, but she's just been like, I'm going
2014340	2019140	to sit in your lap and then she'll do like the flat cat thing, you know, where she just
2019140	2020340	turns into a pancake.
2021300	2021620	Yes.
2021620	2023940	And then I'll just pet and purr pet and purr.
2025060	2028900	And then she's like, she fucks off into the night as cat.
2028900	2030740	By the way, I haven't, I have any mascot.
2031940	2033060	The ferret is no more.
2034260	2034500	Yeah.
2034500	2035940	I have the iridescent platypus.
2035940	2036900	The iridescent plat.
2036900	2037300	That's good.
2037300	2040180	Cause I'm like, I don't even know where those ferret things are anymore.
2040180	2041540	I'm many of them.
2042660	2043140	All right.
2043140	2045300	The original ferret is in my possession.
2046100	2046740	Oh, well that's good.
2046740	2049540	I'm glad, glad it's, uh, got a good home.
2050260	2053700	There was a couple on the cotton, or I think there was like one at least on the Katamari
2053700	2054660	that Namco had.
2054660	2055160	Yes.
2055860	2058420	One of them got placed on a Katamari ball at E3.
2058420	2061620	I do remember that it was, it was sacrificed to the Katamari gods.
2062500	2064340	Uh, orange right in chat.
2064340	2066260	The last ferret is in captivity.
2066260	2067780	The galaxy is at peace.
2070660	2071780	Gold star comment of the week.
2071780	2072180	All right.
2072980	2073380	Let's see.
2073380	2076580	Uh, I want to address this too, before we get to my gaming week, uh, along the lines
2076580	2078500	of, of dead by daylight.
2078500	2083860	She-Hulk Tandon chat says I have been playing tons of Friday, the 13th, the game, awesome
2083860	2086340	horror, fun, highly underrated.
2086340	2089380	You know, that game kind of came and went and what's interesting.
2089380	2094100	That game came out right around the time dead by daylight did, uh, in fact, I believe Friday
2094100	2096900	the 13th came out a few months before it was first.
2096900	2098420	I think it was first.
2098420	2103140	Um, and, uh, it's, but it's the same idea four versus one and it's survivors and killer,
2103140	2105300	but the killer in this case is Jason.
2105300	2108660	But, and they gave away that game on PlayStation plus for a hot minute too.
2108660	2109300	Anyway.
2109300	2111460	Um, yeah, it's, it's a really fun game.
2111460	2117300	The only problem is that the game got kind of fucked over by all the legal problems that
2117300	2120180	have been going on around the Friday the 13th franchise.
2120180	2124180	And I believe in related note, that was all figured out this week.
2124180	2129380	I was seeing something about like that the guy who wrote Friday the 13th ended up, he
2129380	2133380	does have the rights because he wrote the movie as a contractor or something like that.
2133380	2133860	I don't know.
2133860	2139300	So, so, but legally there's probably a lot of ground still to cover, but, um, yeah, I
2139300	2140980	mean the Friday the 13th game was great.
2140980	2145940	Um, but it just, it couldn't go really much further than where it went because of all
2145940	2146740	the legal problems.
2146740	2149460	Like it really got screwed by these outside legal problems.
2149460	2151700	So that's really unfortunate.
2151700	2151940	Yeah.
2151940	2153380	It was as of yesterday.
2153380	2155620	So she'll 10 says, Oh, nine versus one.
2155620	2156980	I always thought it was four V one.
2156980	2158980	I didn't realize they expanded it later on.
2158980	2160100	That's kind of cool.
2160100	2166500	Um, so yeah, so now people are wondering, Oh, does this lawsuit mean that now dead by
2166500	2170020	daylight could get Jason and I settled down.
2170020	2171700	It could have happened anyway.
2171700	2172020	Yeah.
2172020	2174500	Just, and just in general, settle down.
2174500	2178100	Like there's, there's, we already have Myers and Freddie.
2178100	2180980	There still is the Friday the 13th game.
2180980	2185700	Uh, you know, I, I would say they tried to get that going again before suddenly adding
2185700	2188020	Jason to dead by daylight, but I don't know.
2188020	2191780	Nothing's impossible in this day and age, but I, I just wouldn't, I wouldn't, uh.
2191780	2194500	Well, and now we have, um, the Cenobite.
2195300	2197380	We have the hell king, the hell priest.
2197380	2201940	I mean, it really is as, as you've described it before, it really is the Avengers of horror
2201940	2202580	in that game.
2203140	2204820	We need candy man next.
2204820	2205940	We do need candy, ma'am.
2205940	2206420	That'd be awesome.
2206420	2206980	Pumpkin head.
2207700	2208580	All right.
2208660	2214260	Anyway, that's another, uh, big one.
2214900	2217300	Well, we need the real ghost face.
2217300	2221060	And a lot of dead by daylight players make this mistake is that they assume the ghost
2221060	2222500	faced as a scream license.
2222500	2226420	And they're always like, well, why don't we have, you know, Neve Campbell or, or whatever
2226420	2227540	as a survivor?
2227540	2232500	Well, have you ever noticed when you read the bio ghost face is not the ghost face.
2232500	2234420	It's just a completely made up character.
2234420	2238420	They, because they licensed trailer was hilarious.
2238900	2241060	But again, had nothing to do with scream.
2241060	2243060	They licensed the mask.
2243060	2244420	That's what they licensed.
2244420	2246020	They didn't license anything with scream.
2246020	2251700	Scream had to license the mask when it ended up becoming such a huge thing in that game.
2251700	2253300	She hold 10 says jaws.
2256660	2262740	So by the way, I have to ask real quick and this'll be the last thing for dead by daylight
2262740	2263380	for right now.
2263380	2263700	All right.
2264260	2265540	What do you think of barista witch?
2266500	2270420	Oh, Oh, um, I, I hope this, I can't do the PTB.
2270420	2274180	I hope this doesn't offend, but I think I've actually heard this come out of your mouth.
2274180	2275620	Um, she, she looks like you.
2276500	2284180	Yeah, I am the barista, which looks like you like maybe like in a hot topic phase.
2284180	2292980	If I was really skinny, you know, but she's got red curly hair, wears glasses, um, is
2292980	2294980	into new agey stuff.
2296100	2296660	Hello.
2296660	2297300	Is a witch.
2298420	2299940	Like storytelling.
2299940	2300180	Yeah.
2300900	2303940	Loves books and likes spooky shit.
2304660	2305860	Oh yeah, no, she's you.
2305860	2306420	She really is.
2306420	2310340	She's also the first survivor to be taken in front of a crowd of people.
2313220	2317620	So me entity is getting pretty ballsy.
2317620	2322420	By the way, I finally faced a survivor named Vinnie entity.
2322420	2323780	I can die happy.
2323780	2324280	All right.
2324660	2328580	Uh, by just the chat is, uh, giving suggestions.
2328580	2330020	Uh, and I like the SSJ 100.
2330020	2331380	Matt says the Babadook.
2331380	2332980	That's a good suggestion.
2332980	2335780	Uh, they should add, uh, the Babadook for gay pride month.
2335780	2338260	Um, Bon Stobel six says a creature from the film.
2338260	2340580	The mist dark Tetsuya says Chucky.
2340580	2342500	That's a great, that's a great idea.
2342500	2346740	Uh, our voiceover friend, Jason, what's your face?
2347300	2350580	Uh, VX chase XV says, how about the Hocus Pocus witches?
2350580	2352420	They're not, that's, that's more Disney horror.
2352420	2353220	They're not scary.
2353860	2354100	Yeah.
2354100	2356100	You can't mix Disney horror with dead by daylight.
2356100	2357620	Unfortunately, believe it or not.
2357620	2360740	I got into a sort of debate with polyester on Twitter.
2360740	2361240	Yeah.
2361620	2366180	Who's like one, one of the big streamer folks, um, has that in with behavior.
2366820	2373460	Um, and he's talking about having Elvira as a survivor and I was like, or a killer.
2373460	2378020	And I was like, nah, survivor would kick the observer out of his little damn tower and
2378020	2380180	give us narc the entire time.
2380180	2380500	Yeah.
2380500	2386340	I would see Elvira more as somebody that, uh, it, you would see in the, um, the, why
2386340	2391540	don't I keep, when you say the, uh, the book, the, the, that mode, the shrine of
2391540	2395140	secrets, that whole thing or that whole thing for the, for the record, Michigan's
2395140	2398660	Lizzie Borden actually did not kill anybody.
2399460	2405620	She was, uh, actually never, um, uh, what was the word I'm thinking of?
2405620	2407700	She, she was a judge, not guilty.
2408260	2417060	So I don't like that, that a girl's reputation has been sullied by people
2417060	2418500	wanting to blame her for a murder.
2418500	2419380	She didn't do so.
2420420	2421140	All right.
2421140	2422260	We, we said no more dead by daylight.
2422260	2423780	Phantasm would be great.
2423780	2425060	End of dead by j lights hat.
2425060	2426420	Oh, one more, one more.
2426420	2432820	No, the, the, the, uh, pastor from, uh, poltergeist too.
2432820	2433780	All right.
2433780	2435540	And he sings the whole time like the huntress.
2436100	2437380	Enough, but it definitely should.
2437380	2438660	Original trailer Sonic.
2439540	2440040	Yeah.
2440580	2441300	All right.
2441300	2442740	Moving on my gaming week.
2442740	2444100	I want to talk about my gaming week.
2444100	2445540	So what did I play during my gaming week?
2445540	2446580	I played dead by daylight.
2446580	2446980	Okay.
2446980	2450340	Uh, besides that, I played more cookie clicker.
2450340	2453780	I'm up to 400 achievements unlocked in cookie clicker.
2453780	2458340	I've clicked a lot of cookies, uh, 560 something.
2458340	2460260	I think is maybe five 40.
2460260	2462820	Somebody in chat might be able to correct me on that.
2462820	2465060	But, um, yeah, dead by daylight.
2465140	2465700	I'm sorry.
2465700	2467780	I I'm looking at my phone, my notes, but cookie clicker.
2467780	2467940	Yeah.
2467940	2471220	I've unlocked 400 of the achievements, uh, in that so far.
2471780	2473940	Uh, then I played more Final Fantasy 14.
2473940	2477460	I actually did a little stream on Friday just to, uh, make sure I'm trying to stream on
2477460	2478900	a somewhat regular basis.
2478900	2484260	And, uh, I'm still working to get all my classes to 80 before end walkers out.
2484260	2488260	And the clock is ticking because there's less than 50 days to go before end Walker.
2488260	2490580	So, um, I gotta, I gotta get going on that.
2490580	2496980	My monk is 65, my warrior 66 and my black mage is 75.
2496980	2498020	So I'm really close.
2498020	2502020	Um, I just gotta, you know, put the pedal to the metal and make sure I'm doing my roulettes
2502020	2505460	every day, um, to get up to 80 on all the classes.
2506180	2512180	I've also been continuing to play Final Fantasy 13 on Xbox backwards compatibility.
2512180	2514180	I just got to chapter seven today.
2514180	2516340	So I've been, you know, making my way a little bit through that.
2516420	2521300	And, uh, the, I, I posted some things on Twitter and stuff with some of the like cutscenes
2521300	2525300	and things, and you can see they look a lot better now than they did on the PlayStation
2525300	2530180	three, or especially the original Xbox 360 release, uh, really looked, uh, not great,
2530180	2532260	uh, by today's standards anyway.
2532260	2538500	Um, so it's nice how they've really, you know, um, uh, made it run on the nicer resolutions.
2538500	2543940	Uh, it's, it's almost, it's almost like it's a remaster except it's not really, uh, a remaster.
2543940	2546180	So, um, but it's, uh, it's great.
2546980	2552260	And then I played one other game this week and it's something that, uh, Loki's talked
2552260	2554820	a lot about on this show and he did tonight.
2554820	2557860	And I finally was like, all right, I got to pick up this game and see what this is all
2557860	2558500	about.
2558500	2561460	Uh, and so I picked up power wash simulator.
2561460	2564020	Um, have you ever seen that Reddit?
2564020	2568100	I think it's called like mildly satisfying or oddly satisfying.
2568100	2573540	And it's just a collection of pictures that are like, huh, that is, that is mildly satisfying.
2573620	2578740	Like, it's just like a, like a perfectly organized bookshelf or something where all the colors
2578740	2580260	have been sorted appropriately.
2580260	2583700	And you're like, well, that is, that is a mildly satisfying photo, right?
2584500	2586020	This is that as a game.
2587380	2590020	That is what our watch simulator is.
2590020	2591220	You want to know what's funny?
2591220	2591460	What?
2592100	2594580	When my meds aren't working, I clean.
2595380	2596820	Well, then this, this...
2596820	2598420	And I clean meticulously.
2598420	2599940	This is a game that's an outlet.
2599940	2604020	Well, this is wild because I don't clean this well in real life, but being able to have
2604020	2606180	this in a game sure is a lot of fun.
2606180	2606740	And okay.
2606740	2608580	So power wash simulator.
2608580	2610180	It is exactly yes.
2610180	2613940	DJ rama S and chat says perfectly organized ethernet cabling.
2613940	2614180	Yes.
2614820	2616980	That is so fucking satisfying to look at.
2616980	2617220	Right.
2617860	2619860	And that's what power wash simulator is.
2619860	2625300	And if it's exactly what you think you get dropped in a level where something is really
2625300	2626420	fucking dirty.
2626420	2632260	Like one of the early levels is a backyard and it's like everything is just overtaken
2632260	2634420	with, you know, growth and whatever.
2634420	2638340	And so you and your little power wash gun just start to go to work and you just do a
2638340	2639300	little piece at a time.
2640260	2647300	You just spray it, power washing the patio rocks, power washing the little pond, power
2647300	2652900	washing the fence, each post and the very satisfying as you complete each little part
2652900	2655700	and you power wash it to God's satisfaction.
2655700	2661860	You get the little little day and it lights up and then it becomes super sparkling and
2661860	2663380	it's really satisfying.
2663380	2665220	And then you get to bigger and better levels.
2665220	2670340	So Loki, I just did the playground level was the one I just finished where you have the
2670340	2675220	Stegosaurus slide that's like purple and you go in there and everything is just like black
2675220	2676020	mold everywhere.
2676020	2676420	Right.
2676420	2680180	But then once you clean everything up, it's like, oh, there's like all these shiny colors
2680260	2681060	and things.
2681060	2683940	And then here is the best part.
2683940	2688740	Here is the part when you're like, ah, now that is satisfying.
2689380	2697140	Once you beat a level, you are presented with a short movie in fast time of you cleaning
2697140	2697620	the level.
2698580	2702660	So you get to see how you removed all the dirt and where.
2702660	2706180	And it just and then you see very own time lapse.
2706180	2708180	Yeah, it's very it's its own little time lapse thing.
2708740	2710500	You know, because it might have taken you like I'm not kidding.
2710500	2713140	It probably took me like two hours to clean that playground.
2713140	2713700	Right.
2713700	2717380	But then once it's done, it's like, ah, you see that time lapse video and you're like.
2718500	2719620	That's satisfying.
2721380	2724900	And it also makes me go, I want a power wash gun in real life.
2724900	2728660	And then I go, oh, wait, I know I live in I live in California.
2728660	2730900	That's probably not something I'm allowed to have.
2731940	2732740	Sure it is.
2732740	2733300	No, you can't.
2733300	2733700	You can.
2733700	2734580	I know you can.
2734580	2739380	But it's it's frowned on to use those probably as much as I do in that game.
2739380	2744180	Although I do understand that game has modes where you can limit your water consumption
2744180	2746580	and you can like change the difficulty in ways like that.
2746580	2750100	I don't know why I would ever do that to myself, because then that is no longer.
2752020	2756500	I think they're challenge modes where you have like you race against time or you have
2756500	2761620	like a limited amount of water and then you're supposed to just like see how much you can
2761620	2763300	clean within that certain time period.
2764900	2769860	So it's and you might think like, but no, there is because you can actually change the
2769860	2771860	nozzle on your power washer.
2771860	2775780	And so you have to decide, do you want to do something that's very strong, but a very,
2775780	2777780	very, very small kind of stream coming out?
2777780	2779780	So you're like only washing a little bit.
2779780	2782820	Or do you want to increase how much of an area your power covering?
2782820	2783860	But it's not strong.
2783860	2787620	So you might have to go over an area like four times in order to really clean it.
2787620	2794580	So SSJ 100 Matt says, wouldn't mind seeing a power wash simulator run in GDQ silly block.
2794580	2795300	Oh, for sure.
2795300	2798740	The game is in early access still, though.
2798740	2799300	But it does.
2799300	2800580	I don't notice it.
2800580	2802580	Like I notice games that are in early access.
2802580	2803700	I don't notice this.
2803700	2807300	Maybe the fact that there's only really a handful of guns and upgrades.
2807300	2811060	But like, I don't want that to come across like a negative because I don't think the
2811060	2811780	game really needs it.
2811780	2813220	They're adding new levels all the time.
2813220	2816180	They just added like a carnival level, which I haven't gotten to yet.
2816660	2818260	I saw the thing on the.
2818260	2822180	I did one where you were on fucking Mars cleaning the Mars rover.
2822180	2829140	And I was like, and again, in the mildly satisfying department, your character can jump, right?
2829140	2830340	So that's how you get to some.
2830340	2833380	I mean, there are ladders you can move around and things like that to get to high places.
2833380	2834580	But you can also jump.
2834580	2840980	But Loki on the Mars level, when you jump, you float, you jump like low gravity like
2840980	2842420	you would on Mars.
2842420	2845460	That was very fucking satisfying when that happened.
2845460	2846980	I was like, oh, I'm on Mars.
2846980	2848340	My jump is a little different.
2850900	2851380	That's cool.
2851380	2852580	I have to try that one.
2852580	2855060	Yeah, that one was it's not in the career mode.
2855060	2856340	It's like in a bonus level.
2858340	2863460	So it's only difficult because there's so many little fucking parts on that thing.
2863460	2866740	It's constantly going like you're cleaning all these parts.
2866740	2869940	And then, of course, you're left with like three parts and you're like, I don't know
2869940	2873140	where these fucking things are on the other.
2873140	2876420	Nice thing is, too, if you have a hard time seeing the dirt, I think this is very important
2876420	2877540	for people to know.
2877540	2883780	If you press the tab key, all the dirt turns fluorescent orange and it becomes much easier
2883780	2884420	to see.
2884420	2888660	And so when you also don't have to clean every single thing, it like it'll give it to you
2888660	2889940	like at 95%.
2889940	2892020	Yeah, it'll give it to you at a pretty high percentage.
2892020	2892900	So, yeah.
2893860	2899780	So anyway, that that is that is my shout out and satisfaction for what is probably I swear
2899780	2902020	to God will probably be one of my favorite games of the year.
2902020	2904100	Power wash simulator like no joke.
2904100	2907620	It's just it is a satisfying fucking gaming experience.
2907620	2910020	And that's I think all I ask from gaming.
2910020	2914420	Maybe I'm a little biased because the power wash simulator team actually retweeted a tweet
2914420	2915220	of mine.
2915220	2917700	So I got a little semi viral tweet.
2917700	2918500	I wrote a tweet.
2919620	2924180	That said, hell, yeah, I play first person shooters and it was a picture of power wash
2924180	2927940	simulator with me hosing down the deck and they retweeted it.
2929780	2931460	And so apparently it's caught on.
2931460	2935060	So I guess that's I'm a first person shooter main now.
2935060	2935700	There is that.
2936260	2937060	All right.
2937060	2942500	So, yeah, these and folks in chat, like, for example, She-Hulk 10 says they have a lawnmower
2942500	2943780	simulator as well.
2943780	2944340	Yeah.
2944340	2949220	And I don't think they're necessarily all done by the same company, but it's just the
2949220	2953300	simulator games are just suddenly all the rage for whatever reason.
2953300	2958580	So it's they're good for content because you can do silly things in a lot of them.
2958580	2961300	And so this one, though, not so much.
2961300	2963860	This one got a lot of attention because Markiplier is playing it.
2963860	2969300	He's like a 10, 10, 12 like video series for it.
2969300	2971060	I mean, he's just really addicted to it.
2971060	2972980	So that got some popularity.
2972980	2975220	But yeah, it's just a fun game.
2976340	2979620	I'll be Bobby Blackwell pointed out my tweet has 69 likes.
2980340	2980580	Nice.
2981300	2982420	Nobody liked my tweet.
2984100	2984600	All right.
2985000	2990520	Um, so, uh, yeah, yeah, I love in the power wash.
2990520	2991960	Sam, it's it's a lot of fun.
2992760	2997080	Tiger Claw in chat says it's funny how a lot of simulators are based on very mundane tasks,
2997080	2997580	isn't it?
2998040	3001480	But it's I don't it's I can't explain it.
3001480	3005560	It's just so satisfying to see the sparkle when you're all done with a level.
3005560	3007880	So I will be playing a lot more of this game.
3007880	3010920	And yeah, like I said, probably going to end up on ironically being one of my favorite
3010920	3011480	games of the year.
3011480	3015240	All right, let's move on.
3015240	3016840	We have some other gaming news to get into.
3017480	3018280	Let's do it.
3018840	3022280	Because I don't really Oh, I guess Okay, I have one housekeeping little thing I should
3022280	3025320	probably bring up at some point because I'm not even sure my co hosts know.
3025320	3026200	So surprise.
3027160	3030360	I will not be here the last Sunday of the month.
3031240	3034200	No, then because last Sunday of the month is Halloween.
3034200	3034680	Oh, shit.
3034680	3035960	Are we gonna do a show on Halloween?
3037000	3037720	Probably not.
3037720	3038680	I didn't think about that.
3038680	3042440	We might have to because I will not be here on the 24th for sure.
3042440	3045480	So we might have to tape something in advance for one of those weeks.
3045480	3048200	Um, so yeah, I will not be here on the 24th.
3048200	3049400	I'm going to Disneyland.
3050680	3052040	And you're not taking me?
3052040	3052540	No.
3055480	3056600	It's expensive.
3058600	3062040	But I'm taking Alan and I'll bring you back something if you're nice.
3062680	3063080	Okay.
3063080	3063580	Okay.
3064120	3065880	They don't have Duffy stuff anymore.
3066600	3073080	Yeah, we're just we were going and I wanted I was like, okay, we plan that weekend to go
3073080	3077240	and I was like, Alright, well, if I'm going to go down there, then I want to see like,
3077240	3079480	it's going to be right before Victoria's birthday.
3079480	3080280	I want to see Victoria.
3080280	3082360	So I said, Victoria, what are you doing this weekend?
3082360	3084680	So of course, you know what the reply was?
3084680	3086200	Well, we're going to Disneyland on this day.
3086200	3087960	So I was like, Alright, fuck it.
3087960	3089880	We're going to so we're doing that.
3089880	3094840	And we're hoping to meet some like Twitch friends and some other IRL friends while we're
3094840	3095320	down there.
3095320	3097720	So it's a friend-a-thon while we're down there.
3097720	3102600	You bet you better, better, better say hi to two of my favorite LA people.
3103560	3105320	I have a feeling I know who you're talking about.
3105320	3106600	Let's talk offline.
3106600	3109080	But Alan is coordinating all that.
3109080	3111480	So Alan probably took care of that.
3111480	3111980	So yeah.
3112520	3113020	Alright.
3113640	3114680	Anyway, let's move on.
3114680	3116440	We have some more gaming news to get into.
3116440	3116940	Loki.
3117880	3123960	So with the success of Super Mario Brothers and the Super Nintendo World,
3125960	3133480	Universal and Nintendo are excited to announce the Seth Rogen themed world coming to Super
3133480	3134440	Nintendo World.
3134440	3136440	That is, of course, Donkey Kong.
3138200	3142360	I would hope they would call it Donkey Kong Country, but it's just it's a section of the
3142360	3143960	world going to be for Donkey Kong.
3145880	3149720	But yeah, that is going to be something that they're working on at Universal Japan.
3150680	3154280	Nowhere necessarily when that's going to come out, but oh, yeah.
3154280	3159000	Opening 2024, it's going to increase the size of Super Nintendo World by 70 percent.
3160520	3163800	Hopefully it has some better rides in the Super Nintendo World.
3163800	3169960	As much as I love Mario and stuff and the Mario Kart ride looks all right, I guess not
3169960	3174200	as cool as the VR Mario Kart that I saw at some of the Namco places.
3175720	3177880	They could use some more grown up rides.
3178440	3180600	I'm hoping that they do something like that.
3181320	3187640	So Tiger Claw in chat says the fact Donkey Kong is being added to Universal Japan might
3187640	3191880	be the reason why they are bringing Donkey Kong into the Super Mario animated movie.
3193080	3196840	I actually totally agree with Tiger Claw here.
3198280	3205800	I think there I can't say that all the time, but I actually think this gives a lot of kind
3205800	3212600	of fire behind the idea that a big name like Seth Rogen was cast as Donkey Kong because
3212600	3214600	that is absolutely a spinoff.
3214600	3219320	They're planning for the future is a more Donkey Kong centered movie in the future.
3219880	3223560	Bobby Black Wolf in chat says Donkey Kong was literally the first Mario game.
3223560	3227560	Sure, but now it's the cinematic universe and I don't think the rules have to follow
3227560	3228680	a similar pattern.
3228680	3234200	I don't think we have to expect a Donkey Kong movie, but I think there's a lot of interesting
3234280	3242920	alignments happening that is between the casting of an A-lister like Seth Rogen and this new
3242920	3246200	news about the park expanding to include Donkey Kong.
3246200	3252840	Because surely you Nintendo fans and such as I are wondering why isn't it Zelda?
3254200	3259160	If you're going to expand a Nintendo theme park, would you not add Zelda?
3259160	3260440	That would make sense, right?
3260440	3262440	That would be the biggest Mario thing.
3262440	3266680	Or okay, maybe actually technically Zelda is no longer the new land.
3266680	3272200	If they really wanted to do the biggest Nintendo franchise at this point, they would add an
3272200	3275160	Animal Crossing world would be the world that they would add to it.
3275720	3277320	But they didn't do either of those things.
3278120	3280600	And this is a movie based theme park.
3281320	3287160	So I really think that there is a I really think there's a something something here where
3287160	3290520	Donkey Kong is being set up to be a spin-off movie.
3290520	3291080	And why not?
3291080	3294360	I mean, this really could be a whole Nintendo cinematic universe.
3294360	3296520	If the movie does well, why wouldn't they?
3296520	3299000	Why wouldn't they do a Mario sequel?
3299000	3299880	Of course.
3299880	3302440	Why wouldn't Wario get brought into the picture?
3302440	3303880	I mean, cross your fingers and toes.
3303880	3305480	He's Charles Martinet, I suppose.
3305480	3309160	Those of you that are upset about him not getting past cast as Mario.
3309160	3310520	Why wouldn't they set that up?
3310520	3311960	That sort of cinematic thing.
3311960	3313080	And then Donkey Kong.
3313080	3315720	And then who knows where it goes from there?
3315960	3320200	So anyway, TigerClaus says, imagine King K.
3320200	3322760	Rool shows up in a post-credits scene.
3322760	3325320	Well, that that'll all but guarantee it, right?
3325320	3328600	Pod culture says, and everything ends in Smash Brothers.
3329320	3336040	You joke, but that's that's the they'll have someone come up and talk to you about the
3336040	3337640	Smash initiative.
3339080	3343640	I mean, would anyone be upset with that twist?
3344520	3345240	Nope.
3345240	3345740	Nope.
3347720	3349240	So we'll see what happens.
3349240	3353080	I think that might be a hard thing to pull off because I think the Pokemon movie rights
3353880	3355240	are now sitting somewhere else.
3355240	3357800	But it would be interesting to see if they're able to make that work out.
3357800	3358760	That's for sure.
3358760	3361080	They they've done ambitious before.
3361080	3363320	I mean, look at Avengers Endgame.
3363960	3364440	Sure.
3364440	3369320	And they ended up bringing things like Fantastic Four and Spider-Man, you know, they've gotten
3369320	3370600	all those rights worked out.
3370600	3372360	So anything's possible.
3372360	3372760	Sure is.
3372760	3374200	Because Disney owns everything.
3374200	3375000	Hi, husband.
3375000	3375500	Thank you.
3376760	3377240	Thank you.
3377240	3379640	He set down the coffee I mentioned before.
3379640	3380200	What is this?
3380200	3386120	They instead of putting numbers on the drinks now, they draw they draw spooky images.
3386120	3387880	They drew a spider web on mine.
3387880	3388840	What is that all about?
3390680	3391080	All right.
3391080	3392520	Anyway, thank you.
3393400	3395560	Okay, let's move on to our oh, shit.
3395560	3396360	I'm our next story.
3396360	3398920	I guess I can't enjoy coffee until I read our next story.
3399640	3401080	Yeah, Rob, let's get to it.
3401240	3406280	Um, this story has to do with Nintendo buying another studio.
3406280	3409560	Oh, boy, they've taken one out of Microsoft's playbook lately, haven't they?
3410840	3413800	I'm sorry, did I say I'm sorry, Sony, my bad.
3413800	3419320	Sony bought another studio and they're taking a playbook out of Microsoft here because I
3419320	3421720	feel like Sony has bought a lot of studios.
3422520	3425240	I feel like we've talked about that a lot in the past couple months.
3426120	3429080	But these are all studios and this is no exception.
3429800	3434360	Where it's like, oh, I kind of thought they were involved with Sony already anyway, or
3434360	3436280	like Sony had an ownership in their way.
3436280	3437960	It's more like making it official.
3437960	3441000	So anyway, it's Blue Point Games is who they acquired this week.
3441000	3443080	Blue Point Games is based out of Austin.
3443880	3448280	Recently, they remade they did the remake of Demon's Souls, which obviously was a pretty
3448280	3449720	big PlayStation five.
3449720	3453800	That was really one of the only PlayStation five launch titles exclusive anyway.
3453800	3457400	And they also did that Shadow of the Colossus remake as well.
3457400	3464360	So there's been rumors that Sony was going to buy Blue Point right around the time that
3464360	3465720	Sony bought Housemarque.
3465720	3468760	A lot of people were saying they're going to buy Blue Point as well.
3468760	3471240	And it turns out, yes, that is what's happening.
3471240	3475720	What is not known as of yet is Blue Point going to be remastering past titles again,
3475720	3477640	because that seems to be something they do well.
3477640	3479480	Or are they going to work on a new IP?
3480040	3483720	We don't know what they're working on yet, but I'm sure we'll find out in the not too
3483720	3484840	distant future.
3484840	3487800	So anybody have any strong feelings with that?
3489800	3491240	No, it's one of those.
3491240	3495400	I already thought they kind of were owned by Sony, but, you know, I guess it's making
3495400	3500680	it official a little bit or take their it's what they're taking their relationship to
3500680	3501960	the next level.
3501960	3502840	That's what it is.
3503560	3506440	We knew they were dating and sleeping together.
3506440	3510440	We just now they're taking it to the next level where, you know, Sony is continuing
3510440	3515560	their what do you call the polyamory sect.
3515560	3520760	They're continuing to expand that in their sister wives with yet another studio.
3520760	3521080	All right.
3521080	3522040	Forget these analogies.
3522040	3524200	Let's go to the next story.
3525400	3527400	I actually have an emergency announcement.
3527400	3527720	Okay.
3528360	3531560	You know, one of my favorite channels is the Boundary Break.
3532360	3532920	I did not.
3532920	3534200	There's a Dead by Daylight one now.
3535000	3537080	Oh, that's right.
3537160	3542680	That's the one where they go outside the different they use like the free cam stuff to explore
3542680	3544600	different areas and go outside the boundary.
3544600	3548440	And now you don't even have to be headed on and dead dog for it to happen.
3550280	3557800	Anyway, there is this has been rumors off and on mostly wishful thinking.
3557800	3565160	So we thought except now we're getting more reputable reporting about it.
3565720	3571640	So Konami is going to be following through with their post restructure plan to bring
3571640	3578200	back some classic game franchises, some of their biggest ones, including Metal Gear,
3578200	3580200	Castlevania and Silent Hill.
3582680	3587240	They're trying to at least this is what the talk is.
3588040	3593480	Sources are saying that the new Castlevania game is going to be a reimagining of this
3593560	3597000	series and that it's currently internally in development.
3597000	3597800	Konami Japan.
3599400	3602440	They also are getting some support from external studios.
3602440	3604920	I have lots of support from external studios.
3609160	3611640	There also looks like they're working with Virtuos.
3612600	3618520	So we'll see that's actually trying to do the various
3619160	3624600	rereleases for Dark Souls and all of that.
3624600	3630360	But there was some talk about Blue Point working on a Metal Gear Solid remake.
3631080	3632840	So we'll see.
3632840	3636120	I mean, things haven't looked all that positive right now.
3637320	3641800	And then there also talks about multiple Silent Hill games that are under development.
3642440	3644600	So we'll see.
3644600	3649960	I have a couple of questions with this number.
3649960	3651320	A couple of shrugs.
3651320	3654760	Number one, where the fuck is Suikoden?
3654760	3659560	We always we always have these discussions about classic Konami franchises coming back
3659560	3663160	and all the love is Castlevania, Metal Gear, Silent Hill.
3663160	3664120	Sure, sure, sure.
3664120	3665800	Those are all good franchises.
3665800	3672040	But can we not have Suikoden uttered in that same sentence of great Konami franchises?
3672040	3673800	Obviously, I'm not picking on you, Dark Soccer.
3673800	3677720	I'm picking on everything like I'm picking on Konami, of course.
3678280	3680520	Why isn't Suikoden part of this conversation?
3680520	3684440	But I guess at least we have that whole Ioden Chronicles thing.
3684440	3686600	And I think we're all just prayer circling.
3686600	3693240	It doesn't turn out like the Mega Man Kickstarter thing that flopped.
3693800	3694600	Oh, Mighty No. 9?
3694600	3695640	Yes, that one.
3695640	3697080	I think we're just all prayer circling.
3697080	3701720	It doesn't go that way, which it doesn't look that way.
3701960	3705960	You know, so, yeah, that's that's my first question.
3705960	3706680	Where is Suikoden?
3706680	3709800	My second question is this rumor we're hearing.
3709800	3711720	I mean, I feel like we're hearing this rumor every year.
3712760	3716120	And again, I don't I don't fault Dark Soccer for bringing it up now, because the reason
3716120	3722680	is and why why it's relevant again is that it's more and more respectable or reputable
3722680	3724440	blogs that are picking it up.
3724440	3731000	This is no longer like so-and-so said on Twitter or my uncle posted on Resetera or whatever
3731000	3732520	that forum is called now.
3732520	3734440	Like it's it's not those types of things.
3734440	3738520	This is like sources that have confirmed things for us before confirming that this is what's
3738520	3739020	happening.
3740520	3743240	So I guess we'll see at next E3.
3744520	3747480	So let me ask this question, because we're all longtime Konami fans.
3747480	3749720	Oh, by the way, I left out an important seat.
3749720	3750040	Damn it.
3750040	3752440	I knew I was going to forget something in my gaming week.
3752440	3754680	So I'll bring it up here because it's Konami.
3754680	3756680	A very important game I played in my gaming week.
3757480	3761960	I went to Conquered this week because I went to a concert in the middle of the week.
3761960	3763640	I went to see Alanis Morissette in Garbage.
3763640	3767480	I was living my best 90s life out in Conquered this week.
3767480	3770760	But since we were killing a little time before the concert, we went to round one.
3771320	3777240	So I played Beatmania 2DX Beastover, I think is what it's called.
3777240	3779560	The newest Beastrover.
3779560	3780060	That one.
3780600	3781480	I played that.
3782280	3785480	It's 2DX 28th style is what it is now, believe it or not.
3786360	3786860	Jeez.
3787320	3787820	I know.
3789480	3791960	Remember when I thought the pinnacle was like 7th style.
3791960	3792280	I know.
3792280	3795320	Remember when we were driving to Arcade Infinity to play 10th style?
3795320	3797560	Like now it's on 23.
3797560	3799000	This isn't all that great.
3801800	3806040	I will say so they've redone the machine and I don't know if it was redone
3806600	3809240	for this one or the last one.
3809240	3811560	The magic something was the last.
3811560	3814440	I don't remember, but they've redone the machine.
3814440	3816600	So I got to play on the new machine.
3816600	3818680	It's great because it's a better monitor.
3818680	3820520	Now it's a more like high definition monitor.
3820520	3825480	The cabinet actually has like sides that are built onto it to help contain the sound.
3825480	3827160	And OK, it was OK.
3827160	3828040	Heroic verse.
3828040	3828600	Thank you, Orange.
3828600	3828840	Right.
3828840	3832840	See, I knew some of you that are better at following the recent news would pick that
3832840	3833400	up there.
3833400	3836120	So yeah, it was heroic verse.
3836120	3837400	OK, yes.
3837400	3839480	So they changed the cabinet with that.
3840280	3841720	And here's the best part.
3841720	3844440	There is now a monitor below the monitor.
3844440	3845960	That's like a touch pad.
3845960	3849480	That's where they moved all the sliders to for the sound.
3849480	3855160	So you know me, I take all the sliders and I max volume and then you type you or you
3855160	3856200	press equalizer.
3856200	3859720	You don't have to hit the effector button to get what you want anymore is my point.
3859720	3861480	Everything's controlled on that bottom pound.
3861480	3865080	You put in your passcodes for EMUs down there and all that other stuff, too.
3865080	3867720	So I thought the new cabinet was almost better than anything else.
3868840	3871080	But I also played some of the new songs.
3871080	3875480	I kind of like because, you know, if I play a 2DX cabinet, I just want to go and play
3875480	3876520	old songs all day.
3876520	3878920	But I really forced myself to play the new stuff.
3878920	3880920	And actually, I enjoyed the stuff I played.
3880920	3883720	There's like 2DX red theme is in there.
3883720	3885560	I think it's a remix, but it was really good.
3885560	3888360	So so yeah, anyway, sorry.
3888360	3892200	I know I'm meddling the story a little bit, but that was an important thing for me to
3892200	3893880	throw out is that I did get to play that this week.
3895240	3899240	And Bobby Black Wolf is asking, did you relax and enjoy the concert?
3899240	3900200	Yes, I did.
3900200	3901800	And I had a very good time.
3901800	3905560	And it's been five days now and I don't feel sick.
3905560	3906760	So I think that's a good sign.
3907480	3909320	It was all is not outdoor venue anyway.
3909320	3915080	But the interesting thing, just a quick tangent about where we were at.
3915080	3917000	So Concord is in Contra Costa County.
3917000	3919080	I did not realize they mandated this.
3919720	3923080	We had to have our vaccine cards checked to go into round one.
3923800	3927480	And again, when we went to go eat at the restaurant next door, they checked our vaccine card.
3927480	3928680	I'm so glad to hear that.
3928680	3931640	Which which I'm I'm I'm fine with that.
3931640	3934760	I was just more it was it was the pleasant surprise.
3934760	3939400	Like, oh, oh, well, yes, I will show you my vaccine card to get in here.
3940040	3945960	But the concert venue didn't require it because they're outdoor.
3945960	3946920	The others are indoor.
3946920	3951960	However, my understanding is as of October 4th, the concert tomorrow, the concert venue
3951960	3953720	will also be asking for those sorts of things.
3953720	3954840	So I thought that was interesting.
3954840	3955640	Very, very interesting.
3956200	3959000	Um, anyway, um, where was I?
3959000	3962200	Oh, yes, the title revivals for Konami and all this stuff.
3962200	3967160	So, um, yeah, I mean, like, obviously, Bahmani and Jason kind of referenced it tongue in
3967160	3967880	cheek in the intro.
3967880	3969960	Bahmani is still doing fine for Konami.
3969960	3971000	Nothing's wrong there.
3971000	3974440	It's all these other home console titles where it's like, damn, we wish they would really
3974440	3977160	put themselves on the right track and all that stuff.
3977160	3984680	Um, but yeah, I don't know if I trust Konami themselves to do it.
3984680	3988200	And I think Loki, when you said that very tongue in cheek about, I hope they're getting
3988200	3989960	help from outside sources.
3989960	3991000	Big, same.
3991000	3995720	I mean, the Castlevania Advance Collection is pretty good, but Konami sent that out to
3995720	3997320	another developer to put that all together.
3997320	3999800	And they were games that already existed anyway.
3999800	4002440	So, uh, because the things Konami develops in house.
4003960	4006040	Well, Loki, why don't we go to our next story?
4006040	4007160	Yeah, let's talk about that.
4007160	4011560	Let's talk about the wonderful things that they talk about our concerns in house.
4011560	4012840	Please bring in exhibit A.
4013800	4020600	As, as I had mentioned during our release, um, a release date segment last week that
4021160	4023640	Konami's E football game is coming out.
4023640	4024040	That's right.
4024040	4027080	That's the game that replaces pro evolution soccer.
4027080	4032840	And, uh, it adds a bunch of microtransactions cause it's free to play and you can pre-order
4032840	4034280	microtransactions.
4034280	4036200	And apparently the game is hot garbage.
4037080	4038120	Oh my God.
4038120	4038840	Oh my God.
4038840	4040600	I am so shocked.
4040600	4041720	Are we shocked?
4041720	4042200	Clap.
4042200	4043000	If you're shocked.
4043560	4046840	It like the, the character models look like garbage.
4046840	4049320	Um, it doesn't play well.
4049320	4053800	And it's funny because like, they're talking about like some of the things that they needed
4053800	4054520	to be fixed.
4055080	4061000	And you know, a lot of it is like, uh, too ridiculous.
4061000	4063000	It's like the entire game, basically.
4063000	4069880	Um, so I'm not really sure what the issue was with this, why it got released in this
4069960	4070520	state.
4070520	4079400	But I, I mean, it just looks, I know, I know it's because Konami executives are incompetent
4079400	4085160	boo-boo idiots that are more concerned with getting something out on a certain date to
4085160	4088520	sell a bunch of pre-orders than what the quality of the game is.
4089160	4090200	Do I win a prize?
4093080	4095080	Probably, uh, no prize.
4095080	4097640	So you win a copy of this game, boo.
4098520	4098920	Yeah.
4098920	4105080	As, um, expected, they, uh, came out and they said, they've acknowledged that there's been
4105080	4110680	some reports of problems that users have with experiences or experience with cut scenes,
4110680	4114120	facial expressions, movements of players and the behavior of the ball.
4114120	4115560	That's the entire game right there.
4115560	4118680	I mean, like, I don't really know what more you would have in there.
4118680	4125400	Um, they've acknowledged that there are issues they put out there like little, we apologize
4126360	4127160	for problems.
4127160	4128280	We apologize.
4128280	4132760	We apologize for problems with the soccer ball in our soccer game.
4132760	4133240	Yeah.
4133240	4137720	It says we've received lots of feedback requests regarding the game balance that includes past
4137720	4138760	the defense operation.
4138760	4141800	We also like to acknowledge there've been many reports of the other issues.
4141800	4144760	We just said, uh, we are also very sorry for the problems.
4144760	4145640	We want to share everyone.
4145640	4149800	It will take all this concern seriously and strive to improve the current situation.
4150840	4152760	We will be continuously updated.
4152760	4155400	Quality will be improved, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
4158760	4159320	Dumb.
4159320	4160120	It's really dumb.
4161080	4164120	I don't know why they thought it was okay to put this out like this.
4164920	4166280	It's a free to play game too.
4166280	4169000	Like, like people, like you want them to play this.
4169880	4171320	This is their initial impression of it.
4171320	4173640	They're not going to come back to this crap.
4175000	4175560	I don't know.
4176680	4178360	So it's gotten, it's down.
4178360	4182200	I think it like to, uh, massively negative scores on steam.
4183320	4184360	Unsurprisingly.
4184360	4190040	Um, I would like to put out a special message to anyone listening to this show who might
4190040	4196040	be affiliated with the Italian Siri B the Russian premier league, the French league
4196040	4201720	one, the AFC champions league, the Dutch era Divisi and the tie league.
4201720	4204840	If you represent any of those soccer leagues and you're listening, excuse me, football
4204840	4207720	leagues, and you're listening to this show, please pull your license.
4208840	4210440	Please pull your license.
4211400	4213400	Do what stranger doing you a disservice.
4213400	4217240	Do what stranger things did to dead by daylight and pull your license.
4218440	4221560	You know, the only reason they did that for dead by daylight was because of Netflix.
4221560	4225960	Do what Catan did to Niantic and pull your license.
4225960	4231640	So I just want to point out, like they're talking about putting out new games of these
4231640	4232280	franchises.
4232280	4234200	Let's talk about the track record of Konami.
4234200	4238200	So Metal Gear Solid, we had Metal Gear Solid.
4238200	4241720	Was it, I don't even remember it's called cause it's been blocked from my memory.
4241720	4246680	Crappy zombie game, Metal Gear Solid, the alternate Metal Gear Solid five universe thing
4246680	4249080	that they did hot garbage.
4249080	4253960	Um, so there's that the, the reboot Konami or the Contra game that they made that was
4253960	4256680	also hot garbage, the 3d one that they did.
4256680	4258920	Um, the only thing that's been good.
4259640	4260120	Hardcore.
4261480	4262840	No, it wasn't Contra hardcore.
4262840	4266760	It was, um, that was the Genesis game from back in the day.
4266760	4267720	Yeah, that was the Genesis.
4267720	4267960	Sorry.
4269240	4270120	Rogue Corps.
4270120	4270760	Thank you.
4270760	4271400	It was close.
4271400	4271880	It was close.
4272520	4276440	It, it's just, I don't trust them to make a good game anymore.
4276440	4279000	Unfortunately, like I, I just don't.
4279800	4282840	So I'm not excited.
4282840	4290920	Like if they're going to announce it, they couldn't even get the remasters of silent
4290920	4292040	Hill to be correct.
4292040	4295720	So like what makes me think they're going to be able to tackle a brand new silent Hill
4295720	4296360	game?
4296360	4297880	It's going to be garbage.
4297880	4301880	Although I would argue, and I've said, we've been doing this show a long time.
4302760	4304600	And I said this many, many years ago.
4304600	4306360	We've all said this many years ago.
4306360	4308680	I mean, Konami is doing all right with the Maimani stuff.
4309320	4310680	There's other companies that would do better.
4312680	4313180	Yeah.
4315240	4318360	And I, you, you know, things have come full circle.
4318920	4322760	You know, things have come full circle when I'm, I'm sitting here saying, you know, one
4322760	4328120	of the people I would really like to see have the Baimani license, the folks behind Step
4328120	4328760	Maniacs.
4331000	4332840	And that's all I'm going to say about that.
4332840	4335640	Their games practically have the Baimani license at this point.
4335640	4339320	They have all of the, uh, license tracks in there.
4339880	4343240	Cause they, they played the long game and they've been playing it very well.
4345160	4345880	Anyway.
4345880	4347960	All right, let's move on.
4348040	4354360	And, uh, talk about our next story, which, uh, has to do with Nintendo rumors that never
4354360	4354920	stop.
4354920	4356360	Never, never, never stop.
4356360	4364600	Um, let's talk about, uh, a 4k switch because a report came out this week from Bloomberg
4364600	4370760	who publishes a lot of rumors about Nintendo and, uh, Bloomberg is technically an investor
4370760	4371640	type of magazine.
4371640	4376680	So they have a reason to be getting into these types of things because they, they post about
4376680	4379160	these rumors and stuff for the sake of investors.
4379160	4382840	So that's why they get into this whole thing, uh, whether they're right or they're wrong.
4382840	4389880	Bloomberg posted a report that said Nintendo gave at least 11 developers a toolkit to create
4389880	4391560	4k games for the switch.
4392920	4397480	This doesn't usually happen because usually Nintendo says we do not comment on speculation
4397480	4398040	or rumors.
4398600	4403160	However, I don't know if it's because Bloomberg is a thing geared toward investors.
4403160	4406040	I don't know if Nintendo is sick of this shit.com.
4406040	4410600	I don't know if Nintendo is just a Nintendo chose violence this day.
4410600	4416360	I don't know what it is, but Nintendo decided to put out a statement saying, no, this report
4416360	4417320	is not true.
4418040	4423640	And that is from the official Nintendo Twitter, a news report on September 30th on Twitter
4423640	4428120	falsely claims that Nintendo is supplying tools to drive game development for a Nintendo
4428120	4433400	switch with 4k support to ensure correct understanding among our investors and customers.
4434360	4439480	Notice the way that's ordered by the way, investors and customers.
4442120	4443160	This is very important.
4443160	4446600	Y'all understand the key difference here and why Nintendo said something this time.
4447320	4449080	It's because they're worried about investors.
4450600	4454280	We want to say there's stock prices go down if they're expecting something to come out
4454280	4455240	and it's not going to come out.
4457160	4460360	We want to clarify that this report is not true.
4460360	4466520	We also want to restate that as we announced in July, we have no plans for any new model
4466520	4473480	other than Nintendo Switch OLED model, which will launch on October 8th, 2021, which is
4473480	4474280	very soon, by the way.
4475640	4479560	Again, the Bloomberg report said Nintendo handed out 4k toolkits.
4479560	4482520	They asked developers to create games with 4k resolutions.
4483080	4488120	They named one of the publishers Zynga was one of the ones that supposedly had that 4k
4488120	4488440	kit.
4488440	4491080	I guess that's come a long way.
4491080	4493800	No, Zynga is doing a Star Wars game, aren't they?
4496440	4497000	I think they are.
4497640	4499560	I don't really pay attention to what they do anymore.
4499560	4504840	So anyway, yeah, and I think everybody's kind of waiting for the 4k to switch, but it is
4504840	4507960	just interesting that Nintendo decided to shoot that one down.
4507960	4513080	Now, all of that being said, even reading Nintendo's tweet and taking all of that into
4513080	4513560	account.
4515560	4518680	I actually I believe Bloomberg in this one.
4519480	4521640	I should probably because it's on Nintendo Switch.
4521640	4522280	I sure do.
4523240	4530440	Ah, see, oh, oh, ooh, Loki playing word police here.
4530440	4531640	But you're on the right track.
4532280	4535240	I absolutely Nintendo's been exploring 4k.
4535240	4541320	And I said this when they again, I don't like to turn the show into a game of I said this,
4541320	4545400	but dammit, I'm going to take my credit where I can.
4545400	4549080	When they announced the OLED switch, what did I say?
4549080	4554680	I said they're probably not releasing the 4k switch because of all these stock problems
4554680	4558920	with computer chips that the PlayStation 5 and the Xbox Series X are having.
4558920	4559720	They can't do it.
4560600	4564040	And what are they saying is the reason why they didn't end up doing the 4k switch.
4565480	4567000	That, exactly that.
4569400	4570600	Because of reasons.
4570600	4573160	Yes, it's that specific reason, basically.
4575400	4578040	So again, I think a 4k switch.
4578040	4578760	Absolutely.
4579640	4583960	A Nintendo device that runs 4k is absolutely out on the table.
4583960	4587800	But I think now, Loki, I'm going to give you credit for this one because I think you're
4587800	4588440	right.
4588440	4592360	The way they're playing this game is, well, it's not a switch.
4593080	4595400	It's our next console that's going to have a new name.
4595400	4597880	Or they can just lie about it and just say whatever, you know?
4597880	4600680	What are they going to do?
4600680	4605240	I mean, if they're not ready or anywhere near releasing it or announcing it.
4605240	4606040	Super Switch.
4609000	4610040	Switch U.
4610040	4610440	Interesting.
4610440	4612120	I saw that on a Grindr profile once.
4612120	4612760	All right.
4612760	4614920	Anyway, let's move on.
4615960	4617480	Next story, Dark Sagra.
4618840	4626840	So, well, the game that everybody's playing, every fucking body playing.
4626840	4627240	Not me.
4627960	4631800	That I can't play is New World.
4632440	4637080	And I'm really surprised it's doing as well as it is.
4637080	4639480	I mean, they hit some kind of jackpot with it.
4642040	4646280	Basically, it's an MMORPG.
4650200	4653080	And it's doing well.
4653160	4664040	Basically, it is a colonization-themed game, but they've had things done to it to, I guess,
4664040	4665240	way tone that down.
4666600	4678280	They've brought in some tribal consultants to make things less offensive to Native Americans
4678280	4679960	and First Nations peoples.
4679960	4682920	This game's been delayed like six times before it came out.
4683000	4686440	And I think this was one of the reasons they delayed it was to fix some of these story
4686440	4686920	problems.
4689160	4698840	But now New World has exceeded 750,000 concurrent players on Steam and is being watched by a
4698840	4699960	bunch of people on Twitch.
4699960	4704360	I mean, basically, the only times I'm actually watching the game is really just to chat with
4704360	4710040	my friends because I'm glad they're having a good time, but I really just hang out in
4710040	4712200	their channels just to hang out with my friends.
4713320	4721080	They haven't put out any sales figures yet, but it's been pretty popular.
4721080	4722840	They do have some really long queues.
4722840	4730360	I was hearing people complain about that, and there's already caps on, I guess, what
4730360	4731400	their guilds are.
4732600	4734360	I think it's like 100 members.
4734360	4739720	And I know that the one that a lot of our mutual friends are in has hit a cap.
4739960	4748760	Yeah, a lot of servers are full now, but it's the success story.
4748760	4754200	I mean, they announced three games in 2016, which was New World Breakaway and Crucible.
4755880	4757080	Breakaway was canceled.
4757080	4760840	Crucible was released, then removed, then canceled.
4762360	4767960	And then there were other games that under their code names, Nova and Intensity, that
4767960	4770920	were just dumped.
4770920	4772040	No rhyme or reason.
4772760	4775800	So this one does seem to be doing the trick.
4779000	4784920	The reception is kind of mixed on the game, but the people who I talked to who are playing
4784920	4787480	it are really enjoying it, really getting into it.
4788120	4797400	There's actually a quote on here that they were...
4801400	4803480	I'm sorry, I completely lost my train of thought.
4803480	4809720	That the Amazon Studios were also having that sort of bro culture thing going on.
4811240	4816760	And then there were four different female game developers, so that their worst experiences
4816840	4820920	in sexism were at Amazon and being ignored and undermined.
4822360	4829720	Yeah, so that makes me not want to support the game, really.
4834840	4837400	But at the same time, I also can't.
4838040	4843080	Yeah, Amazon's kind of had miss after miss, and this was probably the title that was going
4843080	4844280	to make or break the studio.
4845160	4847960	And so it sounds like it's caution on the side of make.
4849160	4853160	However, obviously, these other issues that you brought up, these are things that Amazon
4853160	4853800	has to face.
4854680	4859560	I think they already have really had to, especially in the wake of everything else that's going
4859560	4860040	on.
4860040	4862120	I don't even think it made our show roll tonight.
4862120	4865880	But there was a pretty big development in that Activision Blizzard thing about how Blizzard
4865880	4869880	has to pay a lot of money, like $18 million out of this whole...
4869880	4870680	Well, it's actually not.
4870680	4873560	It's like a sixth of what Bobby Kotick makes in a year.
4873560	4876440	But they have to pay out this type of settlement and this sort of thing.
4876440	4881480	So I think every company that's being called out on this is having to take a look at that
4881480	4882520	sort of culture right now.
4883080	4886040	I don't know that we have this in the show role, but it's listed here.
4886040	4886280	Sure.
4886920	4891000	About Lara Miele, I think is how her last name is pronounced.
4891000	4892920	Doesn't sound familiar.
4892920	4895960	Was promoted to a COO at EA.
4895960	4896600	Oh, interesting.
4897240	4902440	And according to this, and I'm going to quote, that effectively makes her the most powerful
4902440	4903960	woman in gaming by far.
4907640	4910520	Take-Two has a female CFO.
4912120	4920440	Miele manages EA's 20 plus studios, highest position that worked on corporate video game
4920440	4920920	strategy.
4921560	4925400	And it looks like, yeah, she's now the boss.
4926360	4927640	Chief operations officer.
4929160	4929720	Well, good for her.
4930600	4931560	And you know what's interesting?
4931560	4936360	EA is kind of like, with as much shit as they've gotten over the years, they're not really
4936360	4938920	being brought up in these conversations, which is a good thing.
4940920	4942840	You're not really hearing about problems at EA.
4942840	4947320	So hopefully that's a sign that they're doing something right in that regard, which should
4947320	4949080	be applauded and commended.
4949080	4953240	I'm not going to say it doesn't mean it isn't happening, but it seems we're not hearing
4953240	4953880	anything.
4953880	4957960	So back to the new world thing.
4958760	4961560	I've noticed a lot of streamers I watch her on this right now, too.
4961560	4962920	And that's cool.
4962920	4965400	I just can't pick up a second MMO right now.
4965400	4969240	There's an expansion less than 50 days away from SE 14.
4969240	4970600	I know I'm going to be into that.
4970600	4971880	That is what I play right now.
4975080	4979080	If I kind of wait till the end of the year, it allows a little time to see, does this
4979080	4980440	new world thing last?
4980440	4982040	Do people stick with it?
4982040	4984200	What quality of life changes do they implement?
4984200	4988600	And if people are still as enthused about new world at the end of the year as they are
4988600	4991480	now, then I'll probably consider it at that point.
4991480	4994840	That's kind of where my head is at with that whole thing.
4994840	4996280	So, all right.
4996840	4998280	I think we're going to move on to our next story.
4998280	5000600	Just to hedge up you guys, I'm going to go AFK for a minute.
5000600	5000840	Sorry.
5000840	5002200	So you might have to buy a little time.
5002200	5004840	So if you guys have random questions in chat, please ask them.
5004840	5005480	I'll be right back.
5008520	5008920	All right.
5009240	5013080	We need more reasons to be mad at Amazon.
5013080	5019480	Let's talk about how Amazon is scalping Xbox Series X consoles.
5020920	5025320	So, yes, this is actually a thing that's happening right now on Amazon.
5025320	5031160	So if you go to Amazon.com and you look for an Xbox Series X, you can see that they are
5031160	5038840	selling used consoles actually fulfilled through Amazon warehouse and by Amazon or sold by
5039480	5046360	warehouse and they're selling them at a markup of I mean, it's almost a thousand dollars.
5047000	5051160	I think it was like nine hundred and eighty four dollars is what they had it listed as,
5052520	5053720	which is ridiculous.
5054840	5057560	Considering that's almost double the price for the console.
5058120	5062600	I mean, I suppose that they're well within the right to do that, but I just think it's
5062600	5070280	kind of a really scammy thing to be, you know, scalping consoles on your marketplace.
5070840	5075640	I can understand if a third party seller was doing that, but being that it's Amazon themselves.
5080040	5080600	I don't know.
5081720	5091000	So I don't know if Amazon's come out to say anything about, you know, comment on it or
5091000	5092680	anything I doubt that they have.
5092680	5098600	But, you know, I think people are still biting the bullet and buying these consoles anyways,
5098600	5102600	even for this markup, because they don't know when they're going to be able to get one next at.
5102600	5106280	Well, certainly not at retail, but it's a captive audience almost.
5107160	5107560	It is.
5107560	5110840	I wouldn't be surprised if they're doing the same thing for the PlayStation five.
5112200	5116920	I haven't seen that yet, but it is kind of terrible that they're doing this.
5116920	5120760	At least I don't know why you would sell your used console to Amazon.
5120760	5125080	I know I've seen the advertisements on their site where they try to get you to sell used
5125080	5127320	console to them or trade it in or something like that.
5129160	5135480	But yeah, I would definitely be clear that let's not support them in this sense as it is.
5138360	5139160	Just be patient.
5140600	5142760	That's that's pretty much what I'm doing.
5142760	5146360	If I see something in the wild that I might want, that's hard to get,
5147240	5148200	then I'll go for it.
5148520	5152680	If I don't get it, then then say lovey, I save money.
5152680	5156360	Yeah, but Bobby, you say that this isn't Amazon selling them,
5156360	5160040	but it is saying that it is sold by Amazon Warehouse.
5160040	5164440	Now, I understand that Amazon, you know, they have a lot of like third party sellers that
5164440	5166520	fulfill through the warehouse.
5166520	5171080	But this is actually saying it's being sold by Amazon through Amazon Warehouse.
5171960	5174920	And I mean, it doesn't have another seller name on it.
5174920	5179640	Amazon Warehouse is they're kind of they do sell some wholesale stuff out of there,
5179640	5182600	like used, you know, stuff like that.
5182600	5183880	I open box maybe.
5183880	5186840	But I think this is actually Amazon in this case.
5188600	5191000	It doesn't says it doesn't have another store name on it.
5191000	5195640	And all I see is Amazon for all the different, you know, the seller and where it's filled
5195640	5195960	through.
5195960	5197640	I'm assuming that it is Amazon.
5197640	5206440	No, but I guess I don't know.
5208040	5213320	I'll tell you what, I'm going to be Switzerland in this and I will just ask the source if
5213320	5214840	I really cared that much to know.
5216920	5225080	OK, yeah, but I guess Rob is still doing is doing his thing.
5225080	5227720	So, you know.
5229240	5231160	Well, my next thing is classic games.
5231160	5234440	So, yeah, sorry, I'm back.
5234440	5234940	Hi.
5235400	5237000	OK, welcome back.
5237960	5238600	Are we good to go?
5238600	5239480	Now it's my turn.
5240280	5240840	Oh, sorry.
5241400	5243080	Did you want to know?
5243080	5245640	No, no, it's my turn to go AFK and get chocolate.
5247160	5249480	How can I assume it's not Amazon selling this?
5249480	5255000	Because, I mean, it literally says, you know, that this is sold by Amazon Warehouse, ships
5255000	5256120	from Amazon.com.
5256120	5261640	Like, I don't get how I would assume that this is a third party seller through Amazon
5261640	5262120	Warehouse.
5262120	5266760	I get like you can have a third party seller and they'll have their seller name sold by
5266760	5272440	this person, you know, ships from Amazon.com, whereas they store, you know, some of the
5272440	5273560	inventory for them.
5273560	5277160	They actually warehouse that and they ship it straight out of their warehouses.
5277160	5282040	But like, I don't know in this case, I don't know.
5282040	5284360	I don't think this is a third party seller in this sense.
5285720	5289880	Agree to disagree, I guess.
5289880	5293720	Why can't we just walk into Target and buy one of these off the shelf?
5293720	5293960	All right.
5293960	5294520	Yes, I know.
5294520	5296920	Yes, I know chip shortages, but it's just annoying.
5297960	5298280	All right.
5298280	5300280	I thought they were honest question.
5300280	5304680	I thought they were supposed to, like, pass legislation to, like, try to work on this
5304680	5305000	issue.
5305000	5307320	Wasn't that a thing that they were talking about that they wanted to?
5308040	5310680	There's no legislation being passed anymore.
5310680	5311960	Yeah, I guess that's true.
5311960	5312520	Good point.
5312520	5314760	All right, moving on.
5314760	5316840	Well, at least we know this game's coming.
5316840	5320280	Monster Hunter Rise will be making its way to the PC.
5320280	5323720	It's going to come out on January 12th of 2022.
5325080	5329000	So apparently there's some collaborations that are going to be happening with that with
5329000	5331880	ghosts and goblins and Sonic the Hedgehog.
5332520	5335560	How Sonic the Hedgehog and Monster Hunter are going to come together.
5335560	5337480	I'm not sure that could be very interesting, though.
5338360	5339080	But anyhow.
5341560	5344520	There's also an expansion that's on its way.
5344520	5346040	Monster Hunter Rise Sunbreak.
5346040	5349960	I think we saw that in the latest Nintendo Direct, and that will be on its way to the
5349960	5351320	PC version as well.
5351320	5354120	That's due out summer of 2022.
5355000	5361880	The Ghosts and Goblins collaboration, the Brave Knight Arthur from Ghosts and Goblins
5361880	5363560	will be in the game.
5363560	5369240	After you complete an event quest, you can take on Arthur's iconic armor and the throwing
5369240	5371240	knives transform into lances.
5371240	5374760	So I guess you just go around kind of like you're Arthur, even though you're not actually
5374760	5375080	Arthur.
5375080	5375720	That's interesting.
5376520	5381160	And as far as the details for Sonic the Hedgehog and the 30th anniversary, which I guess is
5381160	5386920	also next year, all they're saying is it's happening and the event quest will be out
5386920	5387880	in November.
5387880	5389720	So that's a ways out.
5389720	5391960	So very interesting with that.
5394920	5400200	I'm sure there will be some people that will be excited to check that out on the PC when
5400200	5403960	that comes out, because it's probably going to look a little better than it does on the
5403960	5404840	Switch.
5404840	5407640	You know, just especially if you have a beefy PC, we'll see.
5408280	5411960	So all right, let's move on.
5412600	5419560	We're going to go to a good old classic segment here, and we won't talk about shiny new PC
5419560	5422360	games, but we'll talk about some weird things.
5422360	5423400	Fucking weird games.
5423400	5423960	That's right.
5423960	5427000	Let's get to this next segment with this little interlude.
5430200	5444760	And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time, where I'll dive into the vault and pull
5444760	5447080	out a classic and tell you about it.
5447080	5449720	It's time for the classic game of the week.
5451320	5454600	This is one big flag, Dark Sakura.
5454600	5456360	What did you pick for the flag tonight?
5457320	5459880	I picked the SEGA toilet.
5459880	5461320	T-O-Y-L-E-T.
5464120	5467080	If you're not familiar with what this...
5467080	5469320	I can't stop laughing because it's so stupid.
5471800	5477240	So they have a little game system at urinals.
5477880	5481400	First of all, why's it got to be just for the dick possessing?
5481400	5482280	I'm sorry.
5482280	5484600	That's sexist as all fuck.
5485560	5490280	But it's an interactive urinal system that was developed by SEGA AM1.
5491480	5495000	They have LCD screens and pressure sensors.
5495640	5500520	They do show like ads between the games, but basically you can play the games and store
5500520	5503400	your score on a flash drive.
5505560	5513080	They are installed in four stations for Tokyo Metro, including Akihabara, Soga, and Ikebukuro.
5513320	5522120	There also were some in Tokyo, Joypolis, so the different minigames on them is one called
5523000	5530120	Manic and Piss, which is basically named after the statue of the urinating boy from Brussels.
5531880	5533640	Seeing just how hard you can pee.
5534360	5539800	There's Graffiti Eraser, where you're going to use your pee to power wash.
5540360	5542120	Power washing simulator, y'all.
5542120	5542620	No.
5544360	5552120	There's one called The North Wind, The Sun, and Me, where you are playing the wind trying
5552120	5556440	to lift a girl's skirt by blowing air at her.
5556440	5558440	Fucking sexist garbage.
5559320	5562440	The strength of the wind is how forceful the pee is.
5563560	5568440	And then there's Battle Milk from Nose, where you complete a battle for the nose.
5568920	5575240	Where you complete against the person who last used the urinal to compare how strong
5575240	5576520	your pee stream is.
5577880	5583160	They are represented on screen as jets of milk squirting out of the noses of two characters
5583160	5584440	standing in a sumo ring.
5585240	5587720	And if you pee harder, you win.
5587720	5589800	You knock the opponent out of the ring.
5590520	5596040	This is the most stupid thing I've ever heard, especially how sexist these are.
5599000	5607480	Um, so there also are a few other types of interactive urinal things, not just by Sega.
5608440	5615080	There's a British company called Captive Media that installed them.
5615800	5619320	They also use infrared detection for temperature.
5619320	5620440	So it's kind of weird.
5621240	5627320	But they have them installed at the exhibit in Ballum, London.
5627400	5630520	And Tabushbar in Cambridge.
5631400	5636360	So you basically use your pee as a directional thing.
5636360	5640680	One's called On the Piest, which is a skiing game where you knock over penguins.
5641880	5645000	And another one called Clever Dick, which is a pub quiz game.
5646040	5648360	You have to answer true or false with your pee.
5651560	5652360	There's a few others.
5652360	5656920	One's called Place to Pee that was formerly called Pee Station.
5656920	5660520	Sorry, Plee Station, which Plee means toilet in Dutch.
5660520	5662440	I think Pee Station would have been funnier.
5663560	5671320	But it's more interactive pissing in the terminal.
5671880	5676520	There's also called the Interactive Urinal Communicator, which is an advertising device.
5679400	5684760	And it basically is just trying to sell you shit with your pee.
5685560	5689560	But of course, the best of them all is the Sega toilet,
5690280	5692920	because they're terrible humans who came up with this.
5694040	5694600	And that's it.
5696760	5701320	Seriously, install a Nintendo in the ladies room, please.
5702680	5705080	Did you say it sells you shit with your pee?
5705080	5708360	Like, I'm reminded of that South Park episode, the poo that took a pee.
5710040	5710760	Anyone?
5710760	5717480	It it's it's just it's novel, which is why I did it.
5718040	5720520	But at the same time, it is intensely sexist.
5720520	5723000	It's just I I'm exhausted.
5723000	5725160	Like this whole segment has made me exhausted.
5727160	5735320	I don't understand what if you're going to pee, why it should be made into a game?
5737400	5739400	How long are people peeing for?
5739400	5742760	Next year, we're going to have like the poop strength test or something.
5743720	5746680	The bigger shit you lay, the higher score you get.
5747720	5752760	I'm trying to think of places I want to be less than a public restroom.
5754440	5760040	Not to mention, like, you know, like flashing screen images and sounds are just going to
5760040	5763640	draw the attention of the person next to you to look at your screens.
5763640	5765960	Like, I'm sorry, that's even more uncomfortable.
5765960	5768360	Is peeing in Japan naturally competitive?
5769480	5770040	I don't know.
5770040	5771560	Everything is competitive.
5771560	5772440	That's the stereotype.
5773080	5777800	Tiger Claw in chat says this is something they should probably add in movie theater restrooms,
5777800	5781480	because you can probably get a really good score because of all the pee you had to hold
5781480	5782840	in while watching a movie.
5782840	5786520	While I completely understand and respect your logic, Tiger Claw, I don't ever want
5786520	5787240	to see this again.
5788680	5792600	No, nobody should consider putting this anywhere in the trash.
5792600	5793320	That's where it should go.
5793880	5794680	The bin.
5794680	5795480	Put it in the bin.
5796200	5800920	That's where Mommy is feverishly writing down these ideas for their next game.
5802120	5803480	All I can say is no.
5807400	5808520	Anyway, the answer is no.
5809240	5809800	There it is.
5810440	5812360	Your fucking weird arcade game of the month.
5812360	5813480	And boy, is it weird.
5814440	5815960	The Toylet.
5816760	5818920	That's T-O-Y-L-E-T.
5821240	5824360	Dark Tetsuya says this is in Yakuza 2, apparently, of course.
5824360	5825000	Of course it is.
5825480	5827800	All right, let's move on.
5827800	5829080	Let's let's travel around.
5829080	5830760	Let's cleanse the palette, please.
5830760	5835240	Let's let's wash that segment away with some rapid fire news.
5835800	5838520	Let's let's let's flush on to our next segment.
5838520	5839020	Loki.
5840120	5849160	So D3 has announced that Earth Defense 4 6 has been delayed to 2022, to which I say
5849160	5852040	I forgot that there was Earth Defense 4 6 coming out.
5852040	5856680	Also, they all look the same, and I really wish they would innovate on their game because
5856680	5860120	it's like literally the same game that they've released six times now.
5860120	5863160	Quite the read coming from you because you're a fan of that franchise normally.
5863160	5863720	I am.
5863720	5867480	It's stupid fun, but like their games look all the same.
5867480	5871080	Like it's always the same, like always the same.
5871080	5874200	I just wish they would do something different with it.
5875320	5876360	Whatever, it's fine.
5877560	5881160	And then speaking of companies not doing anything different,
5882440	5888040	apparently still, even though we kind of figured that it's coming, the Grand Theft Auto, the
5888040	5892280	trilogy Definitive Edition has popped up on the Korean ratings board.
5892920	5897240	And yeah, indicating that, yes, it's probably coming out soon.
5898760	5900920	Don't care that it's coming out soon.
5900920	5903800	Wish Rockstar Games would do something different, please.
5904360	5904860	Thank you.
5905800	5907000	Release a new game, please.
5908200	5909000	It's been years.
5909000	5911400	You take a new table tennis at this point, right?
5911400	5913560	Like it's been it's been absolute.
5913560	5917800	I would not take a new table tennis game, but like I get it.
5917800	5919000	Red Dead Redemption 2.
5919800	5923000	Pretty great game, but it's still been years since that's come out, too.
5923000	5925160	So like we're ready for a new game.
5926280	5927320	All right, please.
5928040	5928600	Moving on.
5928600	5929640	Dark Sakura, what do you have?
5933400	5934920	Besides the mute button pressed.
5934920	5936600	I'm hitting it and I said, oh, shit.
5936600	5937400	So that's what.
5939160	5940840	Konami is doing something cool.
5941080	5943320	They want money, so this is a cool thing.
5943320	5947560	They're doing a Castlevania soundtrack collection in December.
5948920	5952680	It is actually the orders are already up for it.
5952680	5954680	It started September 27th.
5955400	5962280	If you order them, you will also get a special 14 track CD that has the midi
5962280	5964840	arrangements of songs from Castlevania Dracula X.
5965720	5971560	And there are four graphic T-shirt designs on Amazon Japan,
5973160	5974840	which I may have to look at.
5974840	5979480	And this is it's so many discs, y'all.
5979480	5980440	It's so many.
5981640	5985160	There's like two sets full of delightfulness.
5986040	5986840	And I want it.
5988040	5992120	The release date for this will be December 15th, 2021 in Japan.
5995000	6001080	Also, Castlevania Grimoire of Souls is back in Apple Arcade as an exclusive.
6001080	6002840	So I might start streaming that.
6005560	6009560	Also, the holodeck is happening, Rob.
6012600	6014360	Everything we do in gaming is one step closer.
6015400	6019240	Well, now there's this thing called the Dream Cube.
6020200	6027400	That is it's like a I mean, really, it's like a room with different screens in it,
6027400	6029160	but I can only see this getting better.
6031160	6038040	Like there's one that's like playing soccer football where you actually kick
6038040	6039160	your ball at targets.
6040280	6041400	It's a giant video game.
6041400	6047160	I mean, you could you kick it right into the wall as hard as you want to.
6047320	6053880	Basically, you know, they are already signing deals with the NBA and Manchester United.
6055880	6060520	There are already 16 Dream Cubes that are set up for the Manchester U fans
6061160	6063080	United across China.
6064200	6070840	It's a 256 square foot virtual reality room, like an interactive cubicle.
6071640	6076520	You're in VR with no headset, which honestly,
6076520	6079000	it sounds to me like I would just get super motion sick in it,
6079000	6081960	but it is closer to the holodeck.
6083320	6087160	It moves pixels at 240 frames a second,
6088680	6092920	which is like four to eight times as much as most video games.
6095000	6097560	You've got like karaoke things in there.
6097560	6101960	You have the back wall is left open so that your friends can watch
6101960	6103560	or swap in on some of those things.
6104280	6107480	But it has all the head tracking.
6107480	6109080	It's pretty interesting.
6110360	6117720	It started development in 1992 when the University of Illinois developed the CAVE,
6117720	6120200	which is Cave Automatic Immersion Environment,
6120840	6121800	and it's gone from there.
6122600	6124440	So keep your eyes open.
6124440	6125320	We're getting close to home.
6125320	6127080	There's even like a graffiti mode.
6127080	6127720	That's fun.
6129480	6133720	So, yeah, can I clean up the graffiti of my urine strains?
6133720	6135160	That's a really good question.
6135160	6138520	Or my power washer, whichever you prefer.
6140920	6141640	I hate it here.
6141640	6143640	Dark Sakura is looking for the eject button.
6144840	6145560	I hate it here.
6146840	6147640	No, you don't.
6151000	6155400	Bobby Black Wolf says the 240 frames per second will help you not get sick.
6155400	6158120	Yeah, I guess that'll help a little bit with some of that.
6158120	6158620	Maybe.
6159240	6159740	Maybe.
6161080	6161560	That's right.
6161560	6165160	I'm only interested in this thing if I can play power washing simulator
6165160	6168680	with a power washer, not what Loki was referring to.
6168680	6170200	I never want that brought up again.
6170200	6172520	They really do need a VR mode for that game.
6173080	6174280	I would be down.
6174280	6178600	Yeah, while I'm usually against like we don't have to VR everything.
6179480	6180760	That one would be kind of fun.
6180760	6181640	Yeah, it'll be fun.
6181640	6182140	All right.
6182700	6185500	Um, if that was it, I think it was.
6185500	6189260	Let's go to our world release dates, and we're going to travel around the world
6189260	6192220	and check out some releases coming out quite soon.
6194220	6195260	Loki, what's out this week?
6196300	6201340	So this week we've got, it looks like a Hell Let Loose,
6201980	6206860	and that is on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X.
6206860	6213260	Alan Wake Remastered on PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One and Xbox Series X.
6214060	6218540	BPM Bullets Per Minute, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One on that.
6219420	6226140	Exophobia on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One and Xbox Series X.
6227260	6232060	Jet the Far Shore on PC, PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5.
6232780	6235660	Lego Marvel Super Heroes on Nintendo Switch,
6235660	6238060	which is weird because I swear to God that game's already out.
6238780	6241100	I guess that's the original one that they're bringing back.

6288620	6290300	We are in the fourth quarter.
6290300	6293980	I know I knew Metroid was October, but I forgot it was like early October.
6293980	6296860	Like, you know, we're giving a lot this week.
6296860	6299900	And I should mention, though, you probably won't ever find one.
6299900	6302380	The Nintendo Switch OLED is also coming out this week.
6303260	6304860	Good luck if you're going after one of those.

6337340	6338460	That's really the same thing.
6338460	6339980	Also out this week in Japan.
6339980	6346940	And of course, the OLED Nintendo Switch also out this week in Japan, as is Metroid Dread
6346940	6350860	is getting a release along with all the amiibo that come with it as well.
6350860	6355420	So it's a very, very busy week with the hardware release and all that stuff in Japan.
6355420	6359660	So those of you that like to import, you know, maybe you're going to pick up one of the cool
6359660	6360300	little limited.
6360860	6364140	I don't think they have anything that special we don't have here, but there's a lot of peripherals
6364140	6364780	and things like that.
6364780	6369020	And like the third party cases and stuff that might be a little harder to find here.
6369980	6372060	Quickly seeing what's going on on the PlayStation 5.
6372060	6373740	It's a big week for the Switch.
6373740	6375660	But the PlayStation 5 has a few things as well.
6376700	6380700	The Super Monkey Ball I talked about earlier is also out on PS5.

6385660	6386620	is out this week.
6386620	6390060	Far Cry 6 gets a Japanese release this week as well.
6390060	6395260	And Back 4 Blood is something to look out for also in Japan this week on the 8th.

6420140	6422380	And that's it for this week.
6423740	6424220	All right.
6425100	6431900	E3VL in our chat over at twitch.tv slash vognetwork says, don't forget, Emi, last character DLC
6431900	6433340	for Smash Brothers Ultimate.
6433340	6435340	Do we get that reveal this week as well?
6435980	6437180	It's October 8th, right?
6438060	6439820	So we'll know that before our next show.
6439820	6441100	Oh, that's exciting.
6441100	6441900	I wonder what that's.
6442540	6449020	Although I disagree with E3VL on who it will be, but it could literally be anything.
6449980	6454380	Your suggestion has just as much of a chance as anyone else's.
6454380	6455100	So there's that.
6455100	6456140	Oh, it's October 5th.
6456140	6457420	It's even sooner.
6457420	6460540	So gosh, we're going to know real soon who that last character is.
6460540	6465740	And everybody's going to say, boy, Sakurai gave in to Waluigi.
6465740	6466380	What did you say?
6467340	6471420	I don't remember when the Nintendo Direct for the Animal Crossing stuff was.
6471420	6473020	I think that's around the same time too.
6473660	6475980	Maybe that's the one that was on the 8th that I was mixing up.
6475980	6476540	Maybe.
6476540	6477040	Maybe.
6477600	6480000	So yeah, we're going to get a lot of big Nintendo updates this week.
6480000	6481040	This is a big week for Nintendo.
6481040	6484480	I mean, technically the OLED Switch is a bit of a new system.
6484480	6488560	I mean, it's, you know, E3VL says they did not announce a date.
6488560	6489760	And Mike Def's confirming that.
6489760	6491440	So they just said October.
6491440	6493200	They gave the vague window.
6493200	6495360	Maybe they'll announce a date on this one.
6496720	6497600	I wouldn't plan on it.
6498960	6502320	If Nintendo's proven anything, it's that they can announce it the night before.
6502320	6503920	And the internet will still be talking about it.
6503920	6504480	It doesn't matter.
6505120	6507280	They'll be like, wait, Animal Crossing Direct.
6507280	6509040	Why didn't you announce a new Zelda game?
6511200	6512240	That'll be Twitter's job.
6512240	6512880	Of course it will.
6513920	6516080	All right, let's get back into some other news.
6516080	6516580	Loki.
6518480	6518880	All right.
6518880	6524800	Well, speaking of console shortages, we're getting word or at least, I guess, reassurances
6524800	6532160	from Xbox VP of gaming, Phil Spencer, that it's not going to be easy to find consoles
6532160	6533120	anytime soon.
6533200	6538480	So they're saying that they're expecting the console shortage to go into 2022 because,
6538480	6540800	of course, chip shortages.
6540800	6547360	And unfortunately, it is something that's going to be not resolved definitely this calendar
6547360	6551200	year and most likely probably going well into next calendar year.
6552560	6554800	So, I mean, you probably already knew that.
6557280	6561680	Well, it's still sad to hear that reality, especially with another holiday season.
6561680	6562320	I mean, think about it.
6562320	6565760	This will be the third Christmas that those systems are impossible to get.
6566640	6569840	Yeah, I don't like being reminded that, you know.
6571840	6576560	That there's still console shortages out there, I guess, but it'd be nice to have a PlayStation
6576560	6578160	five, but I'm in no hurry.
6578720	6579920	Yeah, I'm at that point as well.
6579920	6581920	It's like, I'll just get one when I get one.
6581920	6582420	Whatever.
6583280	6583780	All right.
6584640	6587520	Uh, Bobby said we had two Christmases since November 20.
6588080	6589040	Why can't I math?
6589040	6589440	You're right.
6589440	6591040	This is the only the second Christmas.
6592000	6595680	In my head, we've been talking, I'm staring at 2022 on the screen.
6595680	6597520	And so my brain is going that way.
6597520	6599680	No, you're I can't map today.
6599680	6600640	You got it.
6600640	6605680	But still, even the fact that it's a second Christmas and who knows if they say it's continuing
6605680	6609040	into 2022, maybe we are looking at three Christmases.
6609040	6610400	Maybe I'm not wrong yet.
6611600	6615760	So, yeah, I mean, we're going to have all those consoles that are going to get scalped
6615760	6619120	and then Amazon will flip them for $3,000 each.
6621040	6621520	All right.
6621520	6625520	To pay for their, you know, their Twitch promotions.
6627600	6628000	All right.
6628000	6631840	Well, something that's going to be trying to come back to some sense of normalcy is
6631840	6633040	the Game Awards.
6633040	6636640	The Game Awards, where, of course, they announce, you know, Jeff Keighley is pretty good at
6636640	6640000	getting a lot of good big winner announcements and trailers and things like that.
6640640	6642240	It's going to be happening in person.
6642960	6648080	The ceremony is going to happen December 9th in Los Angeles, live and in person.
6648080	6649840	It's going to happen at the Microsoft Theater.
6651040	6655440	And no word yet on any type of COVID precautions.
6655440	6656960	Maybe they're kind of banking.
6656960	6659200	The numbers are going down and it's December.
6659200	6660080	So maybe they won't.
6660080	6664480	And it is it's being held in California, which has a lot of strict stuff anyway.
6664480	6668320	As I was talking about before, I imagine they're going to require vaccines to get in.
6668320	6671920	That's going to like that's going to be a no brainer for something like this in California
6671920	6673760	in L.A. Oh, it's L.A. County.
6673760	6676800	And I think L.A. County is putting in all those rules.
6676800	6680960	So I think that's almost goes without saying you're going to have to have that and probably
6681840	6684880	I mean, just really depends where we're at come December, I guess.
6684880	6686560	But so it's probably going to look like that.
6686560	6692000	But other other than the masks and the vaccines, it'll be a relatively normal ceremony.
6692000	6693200	I'm going to be honest.
6694160	6695120	Kind of want to go.
6697280	6702400	Kind of want to go like if I could do it like reasonably and get down because the public
6702400	6703520	can buy tickets, right?
6703520	6704160	Or get tickets.
6705520	6706480	I would assume so.
6706480	6712240	And the last time we saw that venue in like twenty nineteen show, it was like half empty.
6713360	6715520	You could you could see it was like half empty in there.
6717200	6720560	I kind of want to go like, am I weird for thinking that?
6721280	6722880	Would you guys want to go if you could?
6724480	6726320	I would love to get out of the house.
6726320	6730400	I'm giving up on going to California Extreme, which is the 16th.
6730400	6731680	That's like in a couple of weeks.
6731680	6732320	Yeah. Yeah.
6733120	6734560	But I mean, I don't know.
6734560	6736000	I have to see how everything is.
6737440	6739440	Loki, we could do I don't trust other people.
6739440	6740320	I'll put it that way.
6740320	6740880	I hear you.
6740880	6741360	I hear you.
6741360	6745440	But, you know, if the if the venue requires precautions, then I feel a lot better about
6745440	6747520	it than it's like I do want to go to Twitch Con.
6748320	6751760	That's you got so much time for the Twitch comes way out.
6751760	6756400	I mean, if we are still dealing with covid in the same manner as we are today, like it
6756400	6759520	went, which it's like, oh, with the idiots around us.
6759520	6760240	Yeah, I know.
6760240	6760880	I know.
6760880	6761280	I know.
6762080	6762480	All right.
6763040	6764640	That would be fun to do that.
6764640	6766800	I really need to stream more on Twitch.
6766800	6770080	So in order to take advantage of that, but I'd still like to see people there.
6771760	6772720	So, yeah.
6772720	6775760	And of course, the Game Awards is broadcast everywhere.
6775760	6778000	And yeah, they're going to be back in the Microsoft Theater.
6779200	6783440	They are saying additional details on health and safety will be in the coming weeks.
6783440	6788000	And of course, Jeff Keeley is the show will adhere to the best practices and guidance
6788000	6790160	from the local health officials, et cetera, et cetera.
6790160	6792000	You can bank on because it's in L.A. County.
6792000	6796000	It's going to be the strictest precautions that the law allows.
6796000	6800160	That's just that's just how it works with certain parts of California.
6800160	6807200	So as 200, Matt says, Rob, if you go, you got to dress up like full gown or sweet.
6808560	6813760	Don't tempt me because I'll just look at the types of things that Lil Nas X has been wearing
6813760	6818720	to different shows, and he's much better looking guy than me and in much better shape.
6818720	6821600	And I think oil and we can wrap you up.
6821600	6824880	I think he's inherited the prince fashion mantle.
6825520	6826240	Well, yeah.
6826240	6826640	Oh, yeah.
6826640	6827040	Oh, yeah.
6827040	6827840	The the prince.
6827840	6831600	Well, and then of course, you also have other folks like, oh, my God, why can't I remember
6831600	6831920	his name?
6831920	6834880	Billy Porter, you know, has been doing that.
6834880	6836080	That man is beautiful.
6836080	6836720	Yeah.
6836720	6840080	So anyway, and I'm sorry, I did cry at that scene in Pose.
6840880	6844960	I have I've only seen the first few episodes of Pose, but I don't watch a lot of TV.
6844960	6845520	I sobbed.
6846560	6848160	Bobby in chat says, I'd want to go.
6848160	6851120	Godfrey from Gamertag Radio is going, oh, that's cool.
6851200	6852640	I kind of I really want to go.
6853760	6857840	Loki, what if like we drove down that day and I got you back by the next day?
6857840	6859920	Like, do you think you could swing it?
6861360	6862320	When is it again?
6862320	6863200	December 9th.
6863200	6864000	It's in the middle of the week.
6864000	6866320	So we have to take like two days off work, but I could do it.
6867760	6868560	Maybe.
6868560	6868960	All right.
6869680	6870560	I'd love to do it.
6871920	6873440	Jamie, of course, you're invited to.
6873440	6875760	But I understand your comfort level may be in a different place.
6875760	6876560	And that's a OK.
6876560	6878560	So if you're what day is that?
6878560	6879840	If it's a Saturday?
6880720	6882640	It's usually on Thursday, I think.
6882640	6883920	I work anyway.
6883920	6885360	Yeah, it's in the middle of the week.
6885360	6889200	So December 9th is a Thursday.
6890080	6893280	I also have another goal for December or January.
6894800	6896480	Is that a Twitch related thing or?
6897040	6898320	No, I want to go see Tara.
6899040	6900080	Oh, that'd be fun.
6900080	6900640	Oh, that's right.
6900640	6903280	Because they're in Vegas now.
6903280	6903600	Yeah.
6903600	6905040	Well, back in Vegas.
6905040	6906880	I've been for a year, a couple of years.
6906880	6907120	Yeah.
6907120	6908400	Well, what is time?
6908400	6912160	Well, I thought I thought it's been I thought we've had COVID for three Christmases now.
6912160	6913360	Apparently, I can't math.
6913360	6919680	So I know I, I, I miss my hearts and want to go out and see them.
6920240	6921200	Oh, all right.
6921840	6925920	Let's move on before you before you head out there at our Sakura.
6926560	6927440	Give us our next story.
6930400	6933840	The one I accidentally closed because I'm a doof.
6934480	6935760	Um, wow.
6935760	6936800	Is it even going to load?
6938640	6942880	Sorry, my, my stuff decided to take a big shit all of a sudden.
6942880	6943200	It's okay.
6943760	6944240	There we go.
6945120	6945520	Huh?
6945520	6951520	I was just at the sidebar says every time I try to open the story.
6953200	6953840	There we go.
6954400	6954960	All right.
6954960	6960000	So, um, Netflix has bought a video game studio.
6960640	6967760	They have bought night school studio and, uh, rolled out five mobile, uh, gaming titles
6967760	6968960	in the European markets.
6969760	6978560	Um, the company, um, sorry, night school studio did Oxenfree, which I mean, that game really,
6978560	6979840	really took off very well.
6982080	6982480	Yeah.
6982480	6986480	So it, if there's a good acquisition, then that would be it.
6986480	6992560	So they introduced stranger things, 1984, stranger things, three, the game card blast,
6992560	6999280	teeter up and shooting hoops on Android to Netflix subscribers in Spain and Italy.
7000560	7003280	And the titles have already been available in Poland.
7003280	7004720	So there you go.
7005520	7008000	I guess it's something, something.
7010720	7015520	Um, it's interesting to see this continue to expand and it's interesting how it's growing
7015520	7018640	beyond just the Netflix properties now at this point.
7018640	7023120	So we're starting to see more and more with this might look like, and that it, it feels
7023120	7025440	like it might be like a separate Netflix thing.
7026160	7028480	Like it's not really integrated into the main app.
7028480	7032720	I bet on PC, it's going to feel a lot different, but, uh, on the, the mobile device is kind
7032720	7035600	of like these two separate sorta sides to it.
7035600	7039600	I think this is interesting as it's, it's just continuing to grow, uh, where this might
7039600	7039920	end up.
7040880	7045680	So, all right, let's move on.
7045680	7050400	And, uh, this is, this is something we had kind of joked about before that is now becoming
7050400	7051120	a reality, right?
7051120	7051440	Loki.
7052160	7052480	Yeah.
7052480	7056560	So, uh, you know, we're always looking for that Twitch competitor.
7057520	7058560	Who's it going to be?
7058560	7060320	Who's not Facebook gaming.
7060320	7064320	I want to make everybody always jumps in and says, what about Facebook gaming?
7064320	7066960	And I said, it has the word Facebook in it.
7066960	7068480	Therefore I have no interest in it.
7069440	7070000	Yeah.
7070000	7080720	So, uh, uh, the site now is, uh, Chatterbait and they're adding support for games in that,
7080720	7085600	uh, there is a list of white listed games that are available to play in there.
7086240	7089120	Most of them are adult related games.
7089120	7093280	Apparently though, like before they used to kind of scold people for doing that.
7093280	7097120	Um, but now they do have some of those in there as well.
7097840	7104880	Um, and I, ironically though, they also have like other games in there, like logjammers,
7104880	7108000	which I guess is like a night or an axe throwing game.
7108000	7113600	Um, but yeah, it's, it's mostly just like adult games that are in there.
7113600	7116160	I mean, appropriately with the platform, I guess.
7116160	7120480	What I want to know about the rules, am I allowed to stream without a shirt on?
7122400	7123760	I'm pretty sure that's a yes.
7123760	7125840	Cause you know, that's a controversy here on Twitch.
7127360	7132960	Although, although, um, they, they did change that rule, uh, some time ago, because I, I know some,
7132960	7136400	uh, men here on Twitch who stream without shirts on.
7136400	7139920	And there's actually a whole little thing that you put like exclamation shirt.
7139920	7143120	Cause people always come in and they're like, you're not supposed to be streaming without a
7143120	7143360	shirt.
7143360	7146880	It's like that rule changed in 2019 and so forth.
7146880	7148480	So it's just, uh, yeah.
7148480	7152400	And they've been adding more, uh, games to it and there's been a lot of indie studios
7152400	7157840	reaching out to them to, um, add their games or whitelist their games to it.
7157840	7162000	So I'm sure that you'll see more of these games on there.
7162000	7164880	I mean, there's a lot of them on Steam, so why not?
7165520	7167280	If they can stream shirtless, why can't I?
7168240	7169440	You could on Chatterbait.
7172240	7174560	It just so ridiculous.
7175840	7176480	What do you guys say?
7176480	7181360	Uh, She-Hulk in chat just says, uh, OLR Chatterbait version 2.0 after dark news.
7181360	7182000	What do you guys say?
7182000	7183280	You want to move the show to Chatterbait?
7184560	7187200	But by the way, do you see where my camera sits?
7188640	7193680	No one would see anything anyway, but you can see what I'm wearing right now.
7194880	7197280	Oh, it's one of your shirts from your personal store.
7197840	7198400	Look at you.
7198960	7200160	How'd the quality of that turn out?
7200160	7200480	Really?
7200480	7200960	I guess good.
7200960	7201920	Oh, it's nice.
7201920	7202320	It's good.
7202880	7203360	It's nice.
7203360	7206240	And I just found out I sold another two shirts.
7206240	7207120	People like it.
7207120	7207840	All right.
7207840	7208640	Congrats.
7208640	7209120	Congrats on that.
7209120	7209280	Yeah.
7210000	7210400	All right.
7210400	7211600	Well, I'm from my internet.
7211600	7215680	I'm sad that we have a little bit of a bummer for this last story tonight, but I do want
7215680	7217200	to talk about this and how it does.
7217200	7219040	Yes, it does relate to gaming a little bit.
7219760	7224720	But, you know, anime fans, uh, were very sad this week to hear about the loss of, uh, and
7224720	7229600	I'm sorry if I mispronounced his name, but Takao Saito, uh, who passed away this week
7229600	7230400	at 84.
7231520	7233200	Uh, oh shit.
7233200	7233520	Yeah.
7233520	7235760	Uh, he was the creator of Golgo 13.
7236400	7241120	Uh, and yeah, nah, he's a big, big, uh, yeah.
7241360	7243520	Oh, he did, uh, Baron Air as well.
7244160	7246720	He passed due to pancreatic cancer.
7246720	7248000	Um, that's always hard to read.
7248000	7249040	That's what got granny.
7249040	7249760	Yeah, that is.
7249760	7252080	And that's, um, and Alex Trebek.
7252080	7257440	That's a really, yeah, it's a really, uh, Patrick Swayze, a really nasty, um, cancer
7257440	7257760	type.
7257760	7259440	It's taken a lot of people from us.
7259440	7262240	Uh, so it is a damned hard one to treat.
7262240	7266960	Uh, he passed this week at 84th on, uh, I'm sorry, he actually September the 24th.
7266960	7269120	So it might've actually been two weeks ago.
7269120	7273440	Um, so of course Golgo 13 was, you know, the huge thing that he was known for.
7273440	7276720	Uh, and you might be wondering, well, what the hell does that have to do with video games?
7276720	7280160	And of course, you know, I'm going to tell you, I'm going to remind you there was a
7280160	7284880	Golgo 13 game on the NES and what's interesting about that game.
7284880	7285760	I remember them.
7285760	7287360	There's some visual novels too.
7287360	7288080	Of course, of course.
7288080	7290320	I'd be able to walk around backwards in that.
7290320	7292160	I remember doing that like moonwalking.
7292160	7292880	That was fun.
7292880	7297760	I also, in that game, I remember them advertising it in Nintendo power.
7298320	7302320	And what was interesting about it was that remember, you know, back in the eighties,
7302320	7308960	you know, way back when we weren't quite as aware of the global, uh, pop culture
7308960	7310320	market and global things.
7310320	7316480	So they marketed Golgo 13 over here without really tying it to the anime.
7316480	7320640	Because they assumed most people here wouldn't know of the anime.
7320640	7323760	Of course some do, but, you know, especially back in the eighties when there was
7323760	7325760	like, well, we didn't get a lot of loop in the third.
7325760	7326720	Yeah, exactly.
7326720	7330640	We got cliff jumper, which was like a, the castle of Cagliostro.
7331200	7334480	So it was just, it was interesting how they had to kind of sell that.
7334480	7336480	Uh, and of course they made other games after that too.
7336480	7339120	There actually was a DS game in 2009.
7339120	7342400	Golgo 13 pursue file G 13.
7342400	7345200	But, um, wasn't there a game boy one as well?
7345200	7352720	Yeah, there was, um, I, I had read this like not terribly long ago.
7352720	7358080	And as I recall, um, for anyone who actually still follows, uh, the manga,
7358080	7360080	cause the manga is still in production.
7360080	7365520	I think his studio is keeping the story going per her per his wishes.
7365520	7366020	Oh, good.
7367040	7367540	Yeah.
7368160	7371440	Shogakukan, I think it's been a minute.
7371440	7372800	I'd have to double check it.
7372800	7376160	Dark Tetsuya also points out there's an arcade one with a sniper rifle,
7376160	7377920	similar to Konami silent scope.
7377920	7381520	So I think you guys series that they should bring back.
7382400	7384560	Let's play metal gear for real.
7385600	7388960	So I think you guys have the idea that yes, because of its status
7388960	7394000	as such a long running, well-known manga in Japan, uh, of course, you know,
7394000	7397200	it's bled its way into other pop culture, uh, places.
7397200	7401680	So, you know, um, this man's impact, uh, was felt, uh, a lot of places.
7401680	7404960	So, uh, you know, we haven't seen a live action series for that,
7404960	7406160	or have they done a live act?
7406160	7409280	There've been, I think, live, live action Golgo 13.
7409280	7410000	I'll double check.
7410000	7412320	I'm pretty sure that I've, I've, uh, seen it around.
7413040	7417200	Wait, because if that cowboy bebop does well, and it seems like the reception
7417200	7423680	to the opening credits and stuff, we're going to go 13 movie came out in 1973.
7424240	7426320	But if it does well, does that mean we're going to finally get
7426320	7428320	our Leo DiCaprio Akira movie?
7428320	7432400	I'm telling you if that cowboy bebop thing on Netflix does well,
7432400	7435600	it's going to be the, the, the flood gates will open.
7436560	7440480	And by the way, there was a sequel to that live action movie,
7440480	7443920	Golgo 13 Assignment Kowloon that starred Sonny Chiba.
7444800	7445280	Oh, very cool.
7445280	7445440	Yeah.
7445440	7446640	That was just brought up in chat too.
7446640	7447120	Very cool.
7447680	7447920	Yeah.
7447920	7449840	I would love to see a live action Trigun.
7450400	7451040	That's for sure.
7452080	7452400	All right.
7453520	7456960	I am going to open up our discord to anybody that wants to call.
7456960	7458160	Just join our green room.
7458160	7460800	And if you're not on our discord, get, get over there.
7460800	7464160	Uh, even if you don't want to call in tonight, uh, join the conversation
7464240	7467040	throughout the week over at vognetwork.com slash discord.
7467040	7468240	We'll get you on our discord server.
7468240	7470800	It's a great way to talk to us throughout the week if you want to.
7470800	7473760	Well, at least I don't know how frequently everybody checks in,
7473760	7475040	but I'm on it every day.
7475040	7478480	So if you want to get ahold of me, uh, you can say hello.
7478480	7481680	Um, over in the VOG network, I'm always in discord.
7481680	7482240	Awesome.
7482240	7483840	Vognetwork.com slash discord.
7483840	7485440	If you want to say hello.
7485440	7489040	Um, and, uh, we get a lot of story suggestions too, and that's how I
7489040	7490640	stay aware of some of the stuff going on.
7491440	7496720	I've gotten breaking news from the folks in our VOG network discord.
7496720	7501200	Actually, there was something that was posted this week that I saw for the
7501200	7502640	first time in that discord.
7502640	7505520	And of course, in the moment, I can't remember what it is, but I'm going to
7505520	7507680	scroll back through and see if I can find it.
7507680	7512960	But of course, once again, invite your calls over at, uh, vognetwork.com
7512960	7513760	slash discord.
7513760	7518160	If you'd like to give us a call, uh, and in the orange launch radio channel,
7519120	7522960	I saw that Konami rumor and the game awards and all that stuff.
7525040	7526240	What was it?
7527200	7531040	I think it was that Konami, or I'm sorry, the 4k denial thing I'd saw in
7531040	7534000	the thing for the first time.
7535200	7538800	Oh, there was this interesting thing too, that Bobby had tweeted.
7538800	7543200	I had heard about this before, but I thought it was interesting, uh, that
7543200	7547120	somebody made a Final Fantasy 14 dancer controller out of a my
7548000	7549360	Microsoft connect.
7549360	7552240	So you actually have to dance to perform the moves and final.
7552240	7556480	It's one of those silly, just because we can things it's like somebody
7556480	7560800	beating soul caliber with the dream cast fishing rod, which I know dark
7560800	7563360	soccer's referenced on the show before rod caliber.
7563360	7567280	That's just somebody do it doing some crazy thing because they can, why not?
7568160	7573040	So, um, and Bobby's pointing out the dragon quest, uh, 10 thing most
7573040	7573840	recently.
7573840	7574000	Yeah.
7574000	7576640	I just saw that comment earlier today from 13 X forever.
7576720	7581040	Says the dragon quest 10 online that got an offline version some months
7581040	7581200	ago.
7581200	7583280	And I remember, I remember hearing about that because I want them to
7583280	7584400	bring that over here.
7584400	7587920	Just quietly got its second expansion as DLC.
7587920	7591040	So hopefully we'll get all the expansions for the offline version, which
7591040	7593840	brings it closer and closer to a Western localization at some point.
7593840	7596640	Hopefully that's what 13 X forever said in our discord.
7596640	7601280	Um, and I'd love to, uh, yeah, I really hope that means that they're
7601280	7603120	going to localize it for English.
7603200	7607440	Cause I'd love to play dragon quest 10 and kind of experience that, um, in
7607440	7609920	the offline version, of course, cause I don't think we'll ever get the
7609920	7610720	online version.
7611360	7612240	That's for sure.
7613120	7616640	Uh, anyhow, uh, Oh, we do have somebody in the green room, so let's bring
7616640	7617920	them on the air.
7617920	7622000	I'm going to, uh, bring them on the air and say hello to them and try to
7622000	7624720	get the right camera here on discord.
7624720	7627440	But hi, you're on, you are on orange launch radio.
7627440	7627920	Who's this?
7628960	7630640	Hey, what's going on y'all?
7630640	7632080	This is fat Ninja DM.
7632080	7633120	It is good to hear from you.
7633120	7633920	Fat Ninja DM.
7633920	7634400	How are you?
7635760	7637040	I am doing awesome.
7637040	7642640	I, I probably need my, uh, nerd card revoked cause I did not see the
7642640	7646640	passing of the awesome creator of a global 13.
7646640	7648080	That is definitely sad.
7648080	7648480	You know what?
7648480	7651440	There are so many news stories that happen in a week and some of the
7651440	7653200	things just slip off the radar.
7653200	7655440	That's what podcasts like us are here to do.
7655440	7659120	I don't envision that we break the news, but sometimes we pick up the
7659120	7661280	news that fell on the floor and slipped through the cracks.
7661280	7662960	And, uh, talk about that.
7662960	7666320	So unfortunately I wish it was, I wish it was better news.
7666320	7667600	Um, but it is what it is.
7668480	7668720	Yeah.
7669520	7673120	Um, I actually, I just want to talk about real quick about the whole new
7673120	7673840	world thing.
7673840	7677520	Yes, the cues have been horrendous, but you know, they did add some and
7677520	7678400	all that.
7678400	7684240	Um, it's one of those things you either really, really enjoy it or you
7684240	7685920	just flat out can't stand it.
7685920	7691680	And with the, the jankiness of combat right now, it's going to be really,
7691680	7694240	really hard for people to latch onto it.
7694240	7699520	Now, I'm not saying that it's awful jank, but it's enough jank there that
7699520	7701760	will definitely throw some people off.
7701760	7707360	But, um, on a scale of one to 10, where one is not that janky and 10 is
7707360	7708880	damn it janky.
7708880	7710880	Where does, where does this fall?
7712160	7713120	Oh man.
7713120	7716400	Um, I have to say like a six or a seven.
7716400	7716800	Okay.
7716800	7717120	Okay.
7717920	7718560	Yeah.
7718560	7721840	I mean, if you can get over that, it's not a bad game.
7721840	7727280	Um, I like the crafting, you know, it's for some reason, uh, y'all talking
7727280	7730320	about the power wash simulator a little while ago.
7730320	7733760	It's something very satisfying being out in the forest and cutting down
7733760	7734640	trees.
7734640	7738400	And then I understand that having several other people cutting down
7738400	7738720	trees.
7738720	7742560	So you see all these trees falling over or a whole bunch of people mining
7742640	7744160	some old names or whatever.
7744160	7748000	And you hear the pickaxe like tink tink and you hear a whole bunch of them.
7748000	7748400	So yeah.
7749360	7749600	Yeah.
7749600	7753600	You either enjoy it or you'll just flat out like this is garbage and I'm not
7753600	7754880	going to play it anymore.
7754880	7758400	So, so I assume the way you're talking Fat Ninja, you are playing this game
7758400	7758880	right now, right?
7759680	7760240	Yes.
7760240	7762160	So, um, what is it?
7762160	7765200	Do you think that's, you know, cause obviously Dark Sakura, Loki, myself,
7765200	7766720	none of us own the game right now.
7766720	7770560	We've all kind of watched thanks to Twitch people playing New World, but
7770560	7773360	what, what do you think is the reason why?
7773360	7775440	I mean, it's breaking steam records.
7775440	7777920	It's doing very well for new MMO release.
7777920	7779760	What do you think is the reason behind that?
7779760	7784080	Is it, is it the, uh, the, the cool crafting system or, you know, especially
7784080	7786000	cause you said none of the battle's not that great.
7786000	7786640	What do you think it is?
7786640	7788720	It's drawing so many people to this game right now.
7789440	7791520	It's just a new hotness right now.
7791520	7797920	We'll, we'll see within a month or so whether, uh, New World has a staying
7797920	7803200	power because yes, um, Amazon is making strides and they're doing things
7803200	7808400	pretty quickly to fix things, but as it wears on and then more and more
7808400	7813360	people are tired of the long queues and so on and so forth, then we'll
7813360	7817840	really actually see, is it the new hotness to say, or is it going to be
7817840	7819040	a flash in the pan?
7819040	7822000	Like other ones, oh, excuse me.
7823760	7824400	Drag them.
7824640	7831840	Um, so I think you are very much right on the kind of the new hotness part.
7831840	7833360	I think there's a segment of that.
7833360	7838880	I think right now, you know, we all know World of Warcraft is not in a good
7838880	7840800	spot in many different ways.
7840800	7843920	Um, you know, there's everything that's going on with Activision Blizzard.
7843920	7847920	There's all the concerns about, you know, um, where the storyline in the
7847920	7849360	game is going and so on and so on.
7849360	7853200	I'm not really trying to dunk on World of Warcraft, but I think the reality
7853200	7858560	is the game is, is hurting more than it's ever hurt in its, you know,
7858560	7859600	years long history.
7860160	7864480	And, you know, most people have just said, oh, now it's time to play that
7864480	7866800	other MMO Final Fantasy 14.
7866800	7870480	But I think New World is kind of showing up like those delays in a way,
7870480	7874880	I think worked out in its favor because now New World is kind of presenting
7874880	7879920	itself as like another option for maybe those that don't think Final Fantasy
7879920	7883040	14 is the good fit for them, which is a completely valid thing, right?
7883280	7886000	I think you got a lot of like, wow, people that are maybe looking for
7886000	7889440	something else in an MMO that maybe like, like some of the crafting and the
7889440	7890320	things you talk about.
7890320	7892960	I like Final Fantasy 14's crafting system, but it's different.
7892960	7896000	So, you know, there's other things maybe the New World's bringing to the table
7896000	7900320	that I think they're bringing at just the right time that I think is a huge
7900320	7901360	part of this as well.
7901360	7904240	And the fact that they are paying Twitch streamers to play it or, you know,
7904240	7906080	giving them codes or whatever it is they're doing.
7906080	7907200	It certainly helps.
7907200	7912160	But I think all of that is just like adding up to like the right stuff that
7912160	7913920	makes this game of the moment.
7914880	7916320	Oh, yeah, absolutely.
7916880	7918000	You know, what's that saying?
7918000	7919600	Strike with the iron is hot.
7919600	7921120	So that's what they're doing right now.
7921120	7921600	Absolutely.
7921600	7926720	And by all means, please don't go on a blizzard.
7928320	7934640	I think it's one of those things that in the producing or creating of games
7934640	7939840	or what have you, you are in this like little bubble of you're constantly
7939840	7943760	walking around on eggshells because, you know, people are doing bad things
7943760	7947680	and they're constantly walking around these floorboards with all these nails
7947680	7950240	and called, you know, countraps sitting all over the floor.
7950880	7953920	But, you know, for a while, you know, you're immune.
7953920	7958480	You know, you got those thick soled boots or shoes, so you don't, you know,
7958480	7962000	skip your feet impaled on those little spikes and stuff.
7962000	7963440	But now guess what?
7963440	7964640	The shoes and slipped off.
7964640	7968000	So now people are stepping all over those spikes and, you know, what's
7968000	7972720	making it even, you know, a lot more funny is the simple fact that, you
7972720	7978000	know, we have community and, you know, people within these companies sounding
7978000	7978400	off.
7978400	7983840	And the main person leading the charge is our awesome Dark Sakura, who's
7983840	7988000	sitting on the shoulders of these people, putting more weight and driving
7988000	7990320	those caltrops and nails in their feet.
7991200	7995360	You know, so it's I mean, it's really bad that this has to happen.
7995440	7998640	But like you said before, Rob, it just has to happen.
7999440	8003600	And, you know, we have to go through that, you know, I guess you could say
8003600	8006640	growing pains before things straighten up.
8007520	8015120	Yeah, it was a it was something that had to be dealt with because it was
8015120	8018080	getting worse and worse and taking over and over.
8018080	8023600	It was a it was a virus that was doing horrible things to the gaming industry
8023600	8025440	that needs to be addressed.
8025440	8027760	Like it's long overdue.
8028800	8032000	And hopefully in the case of Blizzard, you know, they have new management
8032000	8032320	now.
8032320	8037360	The person at the top out, which needed to happen and did happen.
8037360	8038880	New people at the top now.
8038880	8043520	So it's going to take a little time, but we'll see what effect that they
8043520	8044640	have on the culture.
8044640	8052320	You know, you have, you know, a woman at the top sharing, you know, so there's
8052320	8054480	you know, you could say a lot about that.
8054480	8057840	But, you know, the fact that at least there will be some influence there and
8057840	8063600	more importantly, in many ways, from a different company, from the outside,
8063600	8067920	this Vicarious Visions side that seemed to have been doing a lot of things
8067920	8068420	right.
8069280	8072400	So it'd be interesting to see what she really brings to the table.
8072400	8075680	And then, of course, you know, the other gentleman at the top, Mike Ybarra,
8075680	8081280	you've heard a lot with Microsoft and Xbox and has been involved in a lot of
8081280	8085920	the right moves that Microsoft's made ever since, you know, Don Mattrick,
8085920	8089680	you know, and the clown car that, you know, he was running that flopped the
8089680	8091520	Xbox One's initial release.
8091520	8095280	So it's going to be interesting to see where Blizzard's at in a year with
8095280	8095680	all this.
8096240	8098080	Very interested to see what happens.
8098080	8100960	But there's a lot of things that need addressing, that's for sure.
8100960	8103840	And Diablo 4 cannot flop.
8104480	8107520	Diablo, there is so much writing on Diablo 4.
8107600	8111680	It cannot flop.
8111680	8113520	It cannot afford to flop, period.
8113520	8114160	Oh, yeah.
8114160	8115200	Yeah, for sure.
8115200	8118400	The Barbarians are already at the gate with their pitchforks.
8118400	8122080	We're just licking their chops, waiting to attack it.
8122080	8125440	And it's not even nowhere near ready yet.
8125440	8127840	And barbarian, we mean Bobby Kotek.
8127840	8128340	Yes.
8128800	8129520	Yes.
8129520	8130720	Yes, absolutely.
8130720	8131360	Absolutely.
8132160	8135840	You know, so before I go, I just, you know, I do send my messages and
8135840	8138160	everything, but I just want to just say it on air to all of you.
8138720	8140480	I just love what you're doing.
8140480	8143040	You know, y'all come from different walks of life.
8143040	8148400	You've been through your struggles, your, you know, just awesome triumphs
8148400	8154320	in your darkest hour, but y'all still do what you do every single week,
8154320	8156320	pretty much weekend and week out.
8156320	8160640	And you always make Sundays at this time, something to look forward to.
8160640	8165600	And I just really appreciate every last one of you and all your quirks
8165680	8167920	and all your triumphs and all your failures.
8167920	8169520	I just love all of you.
8169520	8171040	You're totally awesome.
8171040	8176000	And the community that you have built over these years is totally phenomenal.
8176000	8180240	So, you know, claps for everybody, claps for the host and claps for chat.
8180240	8182000	Y'all are just totally amazing.
8182000	8182800	Thank you so much.
8183840	8188320	That means like, that's, that's all we need.
8188320	8192960	We, we, it's nice that people give financially and I know you've given
8192960	8194880	a lot financially and stuff that, that is nice.
8195440	8200480	But what you just gave, that's, that's the feel we really need to get us through
8200480	8204720	the next few, you know, years or however long this show keeps going.
8205520	8206480	It really means the world.
8207360	8210640	I guess, I guess I should say this at some point during the show,
8210640	8213040	because something in chat got brought up about this too.
8213040	8217760	So Dark Soccer, we probably should let them know about the Guinness World Record thing.
8218320	8220320	And yeah, so go ahead.
8220320	8229040	They, they denied it because I was submitting it as a single person, which is weird.
8229920	8230960	So I have to go back.
8230960	8233360	I'm probably going to have to resubmit a different way.
8233360	8233860	Yeah.
8234320	8236560	But it's just a qualification thing.
8236560	8240240	So I'll, I'll just have to figure out the right, the right thing to do it in.
8240240	8244320	It was probably one of those things because the record was for Orange Lounge Radio.
8244320	8245600	Then they see that as a business.
8245680	8249680	And so they probably want the money or whatever, as opposed to, you know, Dark Soccer.
8249680	8250800	I know, I know.
8250800	8253440	I'm going to actually see if I can put in an appeal.
8253440	8254080	All right.
8254080	8257120	But anyway, we wanted to just give people the update on that.
8257120	8259680	And so I know that is like a bummer type of thing.
8259680	8261920	And I see that in chat, but here's the thing.
8262720	8264720	I don't need Guinness to acknowledge the show.
8264720	8266160	It'll be, it'll be nice if they did.
8268480	8270000	But nice for a tagline.
8270000	8270640	Yes.
8270640	8272400	Yeah, it would be a great selling point, wouldn't it?
8272400	8273920	But it'd be nice.
8273920	8277360	But what Fat Ninja DM just shared with us.
8278000	8279120	That's really the best.
8279120	8282960	That's way more, that was more important than a Guinness World Record.
8284000	8285760	That is far more important than that.
8285760	8286960	So thank you so much.
8286960	8289440	And it's only marginally better than actually having a Guinness.
8290560	8290880	Kidding.
8290880	8291200	Kidding.
8291200	8291840	That was great.
8291840	8294960	It was really, it was really, no, no, no, no.
8295920	8297360	Fat Ninja understands.
8297360	8298160	All right.
8298160	8299120	Right, right, right.
8299760	8300320	All right.
8300320	8300800	Okay.
8300800	8303280	Which I have one in my fridge, so hey, winner.
8303280	8303840	All right.
8304560	8305280	Take care of my friend.
8305280	8306320	Thank you so much for the call.
8306320	8306960	I really appreciate it.
8306960	8307760	Thank you.
8307760	8308160	All right.
8308160	8308480	Okay.
8308480	8309200	No problem.
8309200	8310000	You take care of my friend.
8310000	8310880	Have fun in New World.
8311680	8312080	All right.
8312080	8312320	Thank you.
8312320	8312560	All right.
8312560	8313060	Later.
8314000	8314720	That was very nice.
8314720	8316480	Don't we, don't we appreciate those type of calls?
8316480	8317200	Thank you so much.
8317200	8318320	Absolutely.
8318320	8319040	Yeah.
8319040	8323360	Orange right in chat says Orange Launch Radio was already declared best podcast in the galaxy.
8323360	8324080	That is true.
8324080	8325280	You know, here's the thing.
8326240	8332400	All we have to do is set up a front to give out world records and say that we do have the world
8332400	8332880	record.
8332880	8335680	We just can't say it's a Guinness world record.
8336800	8337680	There's a difference.
8338960	8340720	And I'm still going to fight him.
8340720	8342400	No, you should.
8342400	8346960	And if we have to look into paying to be recognized as a group, then let's talk about it.
8346960	8349440	If it's not a horrible amount of money.
8349440	8352000	The OLR Kickstarter make us famous.
8353040	8355840	If depending on what we're just infamous right now.
8355840	8356240	You know what?
8356240	8360160	Depending on what we're talking about, maybe we can just chip or I can just chip in whatever.
8360160	8360720	We'll work it out.
8361280	8362640	It really isn't supposed to be that bad.
8363680	8364000	All right.
8364000	8365200	Anyway, anyway.
8366160	8366880	I was going to ask.
8366880	8368480	So you'd gone AFK at our soccer.
8368480	8371520	But I think I think there's no email, right?
8371520	8372880	So I just empty.
8372880	8373200	Yeah.
8373200	8375600	Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
8375600	8377520	If you want to send us an email for a future week.
8377520	8382080	Again, that's participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com because we didn't have any emails.
8383040	8385520	Let's check for any last minute stories from Loki.
8386640	8387440	Not a whole lot.
8387440	8392560	It's mainly just there was a story about and it's predictable because they do this for
8392560	8400160	everything that Roblox creators were creating knockoffs of the games that were in squid game.
8400800	8404320	And so that's been like the new hotness recently on Roblox.
8404320	8405920	But they do that with everything.
8405920	8407680	They knock off every single thing on there.
8407680	8409760	There's no IP that is safe.
8409760	8410160	Hold on.
8411360	8411840	I need something.
8411840	8412240	Okay.
8412240	8415360	So we do these silly little intros at the top of each show.
8415360	8417120	Those that listen live, you see it.
8418000	8421840	You can't do that on television where, you know, such and such will not be seen tonight.
8422720	8424320	So Loki did the one tonight.
8424320	8425440	Thank you for doing that, Loki.
8425440	8430160	And it was a play on squid game where you incorporated the Splatoon characters into it.
8430160	8434240	But I've been hearing all about this fucking show and I know
8434880	8439920	nothing about it except that it's Korean and on Netflix without spoiling it.
8440640	8444480	Because I've heard that you should kind of not know what it's about when you want.
8444480	8448560	But so I'm giving you the difficult task without spoiling it.
8448560	8451360	What is this show and why is it so popular?
8451360	8459200	So the premise is there are these people that have been approached and invited to participate
8459200	8462800	in this contest or game, basically.
8462800	8468800	And so they get these cards and they meet up at a certain spot and they're basically
8468800	8474080	blindfolded and knocked out and brought to this place to play these games.
8474080	8478880	And the games basically what happens is there's like, I think, 456 people.
8479760	8483520	They have like so much money per person and it's the last one.
8484320	8486320	Last one standing gets all of the money.
8486320	8487600	It's a lot of money.
8487600	8492640	A lot of these people have like lots of debt that they owe to like, you know,
8492640	8494800	bad people or something like that.
8494800	8499760	And so the premise is, though, what they don't know going into it is that
8500400	8503840	if you lose the game, you die, you get killed.
8503920	8506000	And so it's battle royale.
8506000	8508880	It's sort of battle royale, but it's them do it.
8508880	8512000	Like, for example, what was shown in there is the first game.
8512560	8518160	They're playing children game like children, a Korean children's school games, I guess.
8518160	8520160	So red light, green light, basically.
8520160	8524640	But there's this creepy doll head thing or this giant doll that's, you know, doing the
8524640	8525600	red light, green light stuff.
8525600	8527840	And if they catch you moving, they shoot you.
8528560	8531280	So it's very interesting.
8531280	8533120	So there's a lot of these different games.
8533120	8534560	So it's arcades murder world.
8536400	8538480	I don't know, but yeah, it's very good.
8538480	8540240	It's an interesting drama.
8540240	8543280	And they have like basically certain rules that are followed in there.
8543280	8547520	No one reveals who their identities are in.
8547520	8551680	It's just kind of all these different characters that they follow through this and like just
8551680	8553360	their experiences with that.
8553360	8554720	So it's interesting.
8556720	8557440	All right.
8557440	8557600	Yeah.
8557600	8559040	And I see folks in chat.
8559040	8559840	They're saying, let's see.
8559840	8563120	I think it was Orange Wright said it's battle royale, but Korean.
8563760	8566240	Mike Deff says it's battle royale, but they don't kill each other.
8566240	8567680	That's not necessarily true.
8567680	8568180	But yeah.
8569520	8571600	I'm going to go with the Marvel analogy.
8571600	8572400	It's murder world.
8573360	8576160	I did ask for the simple version, so I'm OK with that.
8576880	8579840	Anyway, quickly, I don't know if you want to say anything else on the Roblox thing,
8579840	8582800	Loki, but I want to look at some other comments in chat.
8582800	8587200	Darth Tetsuya is saying in chat, if you can pick up Cruise and Blast, do it.
8587200	8588800	It's super fun for a budget title.
8588800	8591040	I played it for two weeks straight, unlocking everything.
8591040	8593920	And Orange Wright kind of seconded that comment in our chat.
8594480	8596960	Yeah, I keep I keep forgetting that that's out.
8596960	8598480	And I do want to pick it up at some point.
8598480	8599040	That's for sure.
8599040	8601440	Also, Hot Wheels Unleashed is apparently pretty good.
8601440	8604560	I haven't gotten that yet, but that's also very good, too.
8605520	8608800	SHO 100 Matt is saying we should get a Wikipedia page up again.
8608800	8612320	Been a while since there was one after some clown got the OLR one deleted.
8613600	8617280	I would love if we had a Wikipedia article again, but of course, it's just going to get
8617280	8622560	deleted unless you have to be able to reference external sources to establish the
8622560	8623760	notability of the show.
8623760	8628320	I think, yeah, I think there are some out there like you got to do like some of the
8629680	8633040	well, first, the fact that we won the first podcast award for gaming and that we're still
8633040	8634400	going, there's that.
8634400	8635760	But what would really help?
8635760	8637600	Here's what would really help SHO 100 Matt.
8639200	8643040	I don't know how to phrase this without sounding like ego, so I'm just going to say it bluntly.
8643920	8650400	We need more coverage in like gaming press, gaming media about the accomplishments that
8650400	8655280	we've done as we're getting into our 20th year of doing OLR, because the more write
8655280	8660000	ups we can get from those type of external sources, that's how we get a Wikipedia page
8660000	8662320	again, because then there'll be external sources to cite.
8662320	8663600	Does that make sense?
8663600	8670160	It can't just be like, oh, 10 years ago we spilled the beans on Beautiful Katamari, you
8670160	8673200	know, and Guitar Hero rocks the 80s or whatever it was.
8673840	8674800	We can't like that.
8674800	8677200	That's not going to be strong enough to hold a Wikipedia page for us.
8678560	8685280	I still kind of think that the fact that we're the longest running show, but unfortunately
8685280	8688800	we don't have anything to really back that up like a Guinness World Record or whatever.
8688800	8693680	But if we had an article about us that called us the longest running show, then you can
8693680	8694720	kind of reference that.
8694720	8696560	Do you see where I'm going with that SHO 100 Matt?
8696560	8699680	That's and everybody, I don't mean to pick on you, but that's the sort of stuff that
8699680	8700400	we kind of need.
8700400	8703760	And then a Wikipedia page can happen again because you'll have those sort of sources.
8704800	8705040	Yeah.
8705040	8707840	And as Bobby Blackwell says, right now, we're not notable enough.
8708480	8714880	I think the fact we won the first podcast award and we're still here ought to say something.
8717440	8721360	But it doesn't it has to get that's hard to explain to people.
8721360	8721840	It's hard.
8721840	8722640	Oh, wow.
8722640	8724800	2005 podcast award.
8724800	8725440	Wow, wow, wow.
8725440	8728480	It's on cam right now if you're watching live.
8728480	8731280	Well, we know it's and it's if you Google it, you'll find it.
8731280	8732000	It's documented.
8732000	8734640	I ironically, here's the thing that gets me.
8734640	8740240	Ironically, there is a Wikipedia page for the podcast awards and we're listed on there.
8740240	8745680	And like every podcast in that matrix that's ever won an award has an article somewhere.
8747040	8749520	Except like one or two, and we're one of them.
8749520	8751920	So to make us an artist.
8751920	8752320	Yeah.
8752320	8752960	Anyway.
8752960	8757200	But I don't want to turn this into a woe is me segment because, you know, again, we can
8757200	8758160	sit here, bitch, wine, moan.
8758160	8758640	We don't have this.
8758640	8759200	We don't have this.
8759200	8759760	We don't have this.
8759760	8760720	You know what we do have?
8761760	8762960	That last call we just had.
8763760	8764320	Yeah.
8764320	8765600	And that's great.
8765600	8767440	Far more important than a Wikipedia page.
8768240	8768960	Heck yeah.
8768960	8769460	Heck yeah.
8770880	8775040	Anyhow, on that note, I think we will wrap things up unless there's another last minute
8775040	8776800	story you're dying to get out, Logie.
8776800	8782000	I'm just reporting that remember how they did it like a boy in the blob kind of remaster
8782000	8783200	remake or something like that.
8783200	8784080	That was on the Wii.
8784080	8785200	That's coming to the Switch now.
8785760	8786320	That's about it.
8786320	8786880	Oh, yeah.
8787200	8788160	Oh, interesting.
8789040	8790080	Yeah, it looked pretty cool.
8790080	8792880	It was like a kind of hand drawn animated stuff.
8792880	8794320	So it looked pretty cool.
8796080	8799280	It's kind of a random thing to dig out of the archives, but all right, we'll take it.
8799920	8800640	That's for sure.
8800640	8801140	Yeah.
8801840	8802340	All right.
8804320	8807200	Let's wrap it up with our final thoughts and good night.
8807200	8809760	I know Dark Soccer is one to get to her stream.
8809760	8814240	But before I go to Dark Soccer for her final thought, I will say thank you, of course,
8814240	8818480	for participating with Orange Lounge Radio this week, whether you did it live here on
8818480	8822720	Sunday night over on Twitch at VOG Network, thank you for that, or if it was listening
8822720	8823520	on the podcast feed.
8823520	8826560	I know some of you do that and then you kind of share your thoughts on Discord throughout
8826560	8828320	the week or via Twitter or whatever.
8828320	8829600	So thank you for that.
8829600	8832400	However you participated with the show, appreciate you.
8832400	8835760	And all we ask, tell a friend or two about the show.
8836400	8838240	Tip off a few media sites.
8838240	8842080	Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice, but we
8842080	8844000	need to get the voices here to get them out on air.
8844960	8849040	A nice five-star review on iTunes or wherever it is you found this podcast.
8849040	8851600	All of that stuff goes an awful long way.
8851600	8856000	If you are so inclined and you'd like to show a little love through some merch purchasing,
8856000	8860160	then I suggest you visit our shop, vognetwork.com slash shop.
8860160	8864640	And you can check out an Orange Lounge Radio t-shirt or a VOG Network t-shirt or a Bobby
8864640	8866640	Black Wolf mug, an OLR sticker.
8866640	8868560	There's a lot of stuff up there that you can check out.
8868560	8870720	That is all at vognetwork.com slash shop.
8871440	8872560	But you certainly don't have to.
8873200	8875440	Um, that is it for me.
8875440	8877520	Let's go around and get final thoughts.
8877520	8879120	And Dark Sakura, I will start with you.
8880640	8883120	Be kind to yourself and be kind to each other.
8883120	8884240	It's easy to be kind.
8885680	8887920	Don't be a salty shit in Endgame Chat, yo.
8891520	8894960	That's when I just leave and don't give them the satisfaction of a reply.
8895840	8899280	I've been actually taking to do the, oh, and one more thing.
8899280	8901680	And the Miss Barn approach.
8901760	8904160	Oh, oh, I saw somebody else do that.
8904160	8906560	I don't know if it was Nick or losing color or somebody.
8906560	8907600	I think it was losing color.
8907600	8908800	Did the whole like chat.
8908800	8911120	Oh, and one more thing and then left the room.
8911920	8914080	And then the thing in chat was barned.
8914080	8915840	That was so fucking funny.
8917040	8917520	That's great.
8917520	8918080	Yes.
8918080	8918720	And it works.
8919440	8921680	You can use that outside dead by daylight.
8921680	8925200	Use that in whatever game is having a chat that's pissing you off.
8925200	8926080	Just let them know.
8926080	8926720	You know what?
8926720	8928720	And one more thing and then leave.
8928720	8931280	And then if they'll just be waiting for an answer.
8932400	8933280	And you own them.
8933280	8933680	All right.
8933680	8936240	Anyway, thank you to our Sakura and have a good stream tonight.
8936880	8937120	All right.
8937120	8938080	Thank you.
8938080	8938580	All right.
8939360	8940960	And then my final thought for the night.
8941920	8942240	Let's see.
8942240	8943520	I don't know if I have a lot to say.
8943520	8948080	I'm just going to, I will reiterate what I said earlier with my well wishes for Bobby
8948080	8949840	Blackwolf and we hope to see you back here.
8950720	8952880	Sunday nights are going to be very strange without you.
8952880	8954400	If it's just one week, then whatever.
8954400	8955360	Bobby's on vacation.
8956240	8959680	But it's going to be very weird if it goes on for any longer.
8959760	8967840	So but obviously everything is that you're doing is more important than the show.
8967840	8970400	So I get it.
8970400	8970900	All right.
8971840	8973680	Last but not least, Loki.
8974720	8977440	I'm hoping to have my video out this week.
8977440	8980800	I was hoping to have it out last week and that took forever.
8980800	8987600	So I'm still fighting, trying to get content to a manageable amount.
8987600	8989760	They can film in a week and turn around in a week.
8989760	8990400	You can do it.
8990400	8991200	I believe in you.
8992000	8992560	Yeah.
8992560	8995360	All right, that's going to do it for another episode of OLR.
8995360	8997600	We will be back in seven days.
8997600	9000400	We're going to know the next Smash Brothers character in seven days.
9000400	9003440	We're going to have a new Metroid game in the next seven days.
9003440	9004480	This is a busy week.
9004480	9006400	Welcome to the fourth quarter, everybody.
9006400	9007600	It's going to be a fun year.
9007600	9010400	We'll see you next time to talk about the latest and greatest in gaming with all of
9010400	9011760	you and your voices.
9011760	9012960	Have a wonderful week.
9012960	9013360	Good night.
9014160	9016880	You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
