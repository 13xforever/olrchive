00:00.000 --> 00:14.400
This week, No Man's Sky rolled out a significant visual overhaul. One of the games produced

00:14.400 --> 00:18.680
a groundswell of hype, came out two years later to mixed but generally negative acclaim,

00:18.680 --> 00:22.520
and persisted with notable content and other updates for the next five years. I haven't

00:22.520 --> 00:26.560
seen this outside of an MMO, and graphically speaking, I haven't seen this in an MMO

00:26.560 --> 00:27.560
either.

00:27.560 --> 00:30.720
This is the headline about a total makeover. Now it's time for your hosts Rob Roberts,

00:30.720 --> 00:33.920
Jamie Summers, and Loki to tell you more about this and the rest of the week's gaming news.

00:33.920 --> 00:36.040
Starting right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.

00:36.040 --> 00:45.680
Hello my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show

00:45.680 --> 00:53.240
where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio, and we are live once again after

00:53.240 --> 01:01.840
a little break last week with episode number 871 of our show for this June the 6th of 2021.

01:01.840 --> 01:07.440
My name is Rob Roberts and I have no idea why my camera went itty bitty on Twitch. We

01:07.440 --> 01:14.840
do tape live every Sunday night at twitch.tv slash VOG Network, six o'clock Pacific, nine

01:14.840 --> 01:20.520
o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby Black Wolf show and sometimes live weird things

01:20.520 --> 01:21.520
happen.

01:21.520 --> 01:29.000
If you're supposed to be recording vertical video, that is a big faux pas.

01:29.000 --> 01:34.600
I think there's a brand new OBS that just came out between the time we did our last

01:34.600 --> 01:40.240
show and this one, and I think it did something to resetting the webcam specs, so I will just

01:40.240 --> 01:41.880
have to get that sorted.

01:41.880 --> 01:45.860
But at least you can see my co-hosts, they look fine as we're taping live on Twitch,

01:45.860 --> 01:49.760
such as Techmaster Loki who popped in there. Hi Loki, how are you?

01:49.760 --> 01:51.080
I'm fine.

01:51.080 --> 01:54.560
And of course, let's not forget the one and only DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

01:54.560 --> 01:55.560
Hi.

01:55.560 --> 01:56.560
Hi, how are you Jamie?

01:56.560 --> 01:58.560
I'm okay, I'm tired.

01:58.560 --> 02:03.080
Tired? Well, you've been going like out and about these last few days, right?

02:03.080 --> 02:08.000
Well, I had, okay, so first of all, I had a sister event that I thought was next week,

02:08.000 --> 02:14.280
it was actually yesterday, but I had taken yesterday off. So I took Becky to San Francisco

02:14.280 --> 02:21.800
for her birthday, a late birthday present, so that she could, as she said, not be a mom

02:21.800 --> 02:22.800
for a day.

02:22.800 --> 02:24.560
I like that.

02:24.560 --> 02:29.400
And so we hung out in the Castro and yay, it was Castro during Pride Month, so it was

02:29.400 --> 02:30.400
nuts.

02:30.400 --> 02:31.860
I like that.

02:31.860 --> 02:40.800
And then we went to, we ate at Cafe Mystique, which is really delicious. And then we went

02:40.800 --> 02:49.440
to Japantown because I needed to go to Kinokuniya for a kanji book. And then I needed to go

02:49.440 --> 02:57.280
to Nijia. Now, Nijia Market, they've, it's already really small, but they've really adapted

02:57.280 --> 03:03.120
to the whole COVID thing. There were lines outside of everything, even to get into Daiso,

03:03.120 --> 03:04.120
so it was kind of nuts and funny.

03:04.120 --> 03:05.120
Oh my gosh.

03:05.120 --> 03:14.080
Let's go. But all that walking with my back and my other condition. Yeah. By the time

03:14.080 --> 03:18.960
we got back, I was, I was deadbeat.

03:18.960 --> 03:22.840
And now I turned into huge Rob, but at least I figured out what the issue was. There we

03:22.840 --> 03:26.840
go. All right. I'll fix that, guys. Sorry. Sorry. I know this is like the most-

03:26.840 --> 03:28.840
You just had your mushroom.

03:28.840 --> 03:29.840
Yeah, apparently.

03:29.840 --> 03:31.840
Move it around the entire time.

03:31.840 --> 03:32.840
What was that?

03:32.840 --> 03:35.560
I said, just keep moving it around the entire episode.

03:35.560 --> 03:40.320
Exactly. Now I'll be big Rob. Now I'll be small Rob. See, we love our folks who listen

03:40.320 --> 03:44.440
on the podcast feed. Of course, you can download Orange Launch Radio in your favorite podcast

03:44.440 --> 03:49.280
app, such as Apple Podcasts, which just got a big update recently. Spotify, which has

03:49.280 --> 03:52.800
been getting more and more into podcasts. We're on a few others too. You can download

03:52.800 --> 03:59.320
us in those apps. But we moved over to Twitch a couple of years ago, doing our show live

03:59.320 --> 04:03.440
on Sunday nights. And sometimes, unfortunately, on the podcast, you just miss these funny

04:03.440 --> 04:08.160
little visual things that happen. But I think I fixed myself. How does it look, you guys?

04:08.160 --> 04:11.760
Hopefully it looks good in our chat. Because we do, again, tape live on Sunday nights and

04:11.760 --> 04:18.120
we have our chat room, which is over at twitch.tv slash vog network. And Sia Tabiri in the chat

04:18.120 --> 04:23.280
says giant Rob is going to nom, nom, nom the co-host. Yes, you see there's Pac-Man and

04:23.280 --> 04:28.840
then there's super Pac-Man. And then there's Pac-Man. Super Pac-Man. Okay, I'll stop. All

04:28.840 --> 04:34.960
right. Let's get into our kickoff topic tonight and talk about some things that we missed

04:34.960 --> 04:39.480
in gaming last week. First off, I hope you guys had a good week off. Dark Soccer, I know

04:39.480 --> 04:43.340
you've been on some adventures the past few days. Also, you were you were here streaming

04:43.340 --> 04:52.420
last week, right? Not here on your own channel, right? Yeah. I was playing Dead by Daylight

04:52.420 --> 04:56.320
like I know I really do. And I had a really good stream. It was nice actually doing it

04:56.320 --> 05:02.760
a little bit earlier that night. So nice. It was it was pretty cool. Loki, did you do

05:02.760 --> 05:06.800
anything special with the long weekend, which by which, by the way, I know I know some people

05:06.800 --> 05:10.200
took some heat for saying like, you know, there was there was some political thing where

05:10.200 --> 05:14.260
somebody said, have a good weekend or have a good long weekend. And I understand it's

05:14.260 --> 05:19.900
Memorial Day and Memorial Day is not a happy holiday, but it does kind of share the distinction

05:19.900 --> 05:25.560
this last year of being a three day weekend as, you know, America and, you know, other

05:25.560 --> 05:29.620
parts of the world are getting to the other side of this covid thing. We're seeing numbers

05:29.620 --> 05:33.440
really start to drop. And I think there were a lot of people wanting to really get some

05:33.440 --> 05:38.040
normalcy back. So I think, you know, yes, even though Memorial Day is a is a holiday

05:38.040 --> 05:42.980
that, you know, is a little bit morose because we have to, you know, be thankful to those

05:42.980 --> 05:48.040
that gave their lives for the freedoms that we experience in this country. This particular

05:48.040 --> 05:51.800
long weekend we just had was the first time in a very long time that many of us got to

05:51.800 --> 05:55.520
enjoy some of those freedoms. So I think there's a little bit of sharing going on.

05:55.520 --> 06:01.000
So, you know, I hope people understand why I still say I hope you had a good long weekend,

06:01.000 --> 06:04.520
because you know what, it's the first long weekend we've really been able to get into

06:04.520 --> 06:09.960
in a very long time. But I'm Loki, I'm sorry for digressing. But how was your long weekend?

06:09.960 --> 06:16.320
I am pretty sure I was just playing Minecraft. You've been doing you've been doing a lot

06:16.320 --> 06:21.080
of Minecraft and I saw some cryptic tweets. Would you care to explain yourself or do you

06:21.080 --> 06:25.360
want to do this later in the show? No, I can we can talk about now. Let's talk about

06:25.360 --> 06:28.640
it now. Because even I don't know what the fuck you're talking about with your tweets.

06:28.640 --> 06:35.960
And I got it. And this is probably going to be lost on you guys. But so I am a huge fan

06:35.960 --> 06:40.400
of I mean, there's a lot of people that are huge fans of this group. But there's a server

06:40.400 --> 06:44.840
called hermitcraft. They're like probably some of the most famous Minecraft players

06:44.840 --> 06:50.400
out there. I mean, they've been running this server for years now. And I mean, they're

06:50.400 --> 06:55.560
kind of all streamers, they all work together, they kind of have this unique community where

06:55.560 --> 07:01.360
they can collaborate and just do all these different projects and stuff. So it's real

07:01.360 --> 07:08.360
exciting. So obviously, as of recent, you know, getting back into Minecraft and stuff,

07:08.360 --> 07:18.320
one of my goals, albeit impossible, would be to someday be on hermitcraft to be able

07:18.320 --> 07:23.760
to join them on the server as a member, which is like, yeah, get in line with all the other

07:23.760 --> 07:27.520
people that want to do that, like every single content creator out there that like does Minecraft

07:27.520 --> 07:33.740
stuff wants to do that. I get that. And that's like, it's, it's just astronomically, whatever.

07:33.740 --> 07:37.680
It's fine. The only reason I want to is because like, they seem like really cool people just

07:37.680 --> 07:41.980
to play with. Like, that's, that's it. That's really the only reason not not because I want

07:41.980 --> 07:45.340
to, you know, play with them because they're famous or anything. It's, it's because they

07:45.340 --> 07:49.000
just seem really cool. And like, this would be a fun group of people to play Minecraft

07:49.000 --> 08:00.220
with. So is the punchline you got in? No, no. Oh, okay. That's not the punchline. No,

08:00.220 --> 08:05.560
that would be hilarious. But no, that's absolutely not the punchline. So, um, she kind of get

08:05.560 --> 08:11.380
to the point here. So one of I follow a lot of them in social media. And one of those

08:11.380 --> 08:17.040
folks that I follow is this guy who goes by Tango tech, who he's a big redstone guy,

08:17.040 --> 08:22.960
and he's done, you know, lots of videos and stuff like that. Well, they had a cherry auction.

08:22.960 --> 08:29.320
With one of the prizes being that I can have a one on one session with him. So obviously,

08:29.320 --> 08:35.260
I bid and obviously I won. So I'm going to have him come on one of my videos that's coming

08:35.260 --> 08:40.040
out pretty soon, like, second or third episode next week. So next week, I'll be playing with

08:40.040 --> 08:43.700
one of the members of hermitcraft. It's got like a million followers on YouTube and stuff

08:43.700 --> 08:48.940
like that, to just invite them onto the server, show them around, show them what I did, and

08:48.940 --> 08:52.900
just kind of like work on a project together. So I think that's absolutely cool. Like, I

08:52.900 --> 08:58.980
pick his brain, like content creation stuff, just, I don't know, that really, I mean, it's

08:58.980 --> 09:04.640
like, you just got to get their attention. That's really like, if you want to, like,

09:04.640 --> 09:08.180
have any potential possible first off, you have to have a channel to decent size, which

09:08.180 --> 09:13.600
mine is not. But don't tell yourself short, Loki, you have been committed to that you

09:13.600 --> 09:18.880
you have something that a lot of content creators can only aspire to have. And that is that

09:18.880 --> 09:23.800
you've had the commitment to content creation, meaning, you know, you've been doing this

09:23.800 --> 09:28.520
show with Jamie and I for it's going to be 19 years this month. So don't I mean, at the

09:28.520 --> 09:33.240
same time? Well, I get it. I get it. Like, you know, sure, I don't know the individuals

09:33.240 --> 09:36.720
directly that you're speaking of, because I don't follow the Minecraft community. But

09:36.720 --> 09:40.500
I certainly follow other communities when dark soccer and I sit here and talk about,

09:40.500 --> 09:44.060
you know, we're watching dead by daylight, and we're watching losing color or something,

09:44.060 --> 09:48.580
you know, or, you know, deer or what, you know, one of the big streamers here on Twitch,

09:48.580 --> 09:51.940
I don't expect that everybody necessarily knows those people. But you know, those that

09:51.940 --> 09:54.940
are kind of in the community are like, Oh, yeah, those are the people that really like

09:54.940 --> 09:58.860
dedicate themselves to, you know, streaming those those types of things, and so forth.

09:58.860 --> 10:02.500
So I think that's super cool that you're getting a chance to and it sounds like for a charity

10:02.500 --> 10:07.680
reason, kind of get a chance to to get this guy's ear a little bit, but don't, don't ever

10:07.680 --> 10:12.920
think for a minute that he can't learn something from you to know, absolutely. And it's it's

10:12.920 --> 10:17.680
not necessarily like it. Okay, aside from being able to play with the cool kids as they

10:17.680 --> 10:23.360
put it in chat, it's also the ice so much hate the corporate job world, like I will

10:23.360 --> 10:27.440
do anything to get out of this thing. And like I see that as like this could possibly

10:27.440 --> 10:31.360
be an avenue to like, you know, the YouTube stuff, obviously, I don't know, it's just

10:31.360 --> 10:35.420
like the game creation stuff. Like, yeah, if I put my mind to it, it's just it's time

10:35.420 --> 10:40.700
like a lot of these folks that do content creation as a full time job, like, I can't

10:40.700 --> 10:45.340
put out that level of content because I'm working a daytime job as well. And I have

10:45.340 --> 10:51.420
a family and it's just it's so hard to cram that into them out of time, but I will do

10:51.420 --> 10:57.940
the best I can. That's all I can really do. That's it. At the very least, it was benefiting

10:57.940 --> 11:03.640
the Seattle was in Seattle Shakespeare Society. So it was good to be able to put some money

11:03.640 --> 11:09.680
down towards that. But at the same time, yeah, it's great to be able to, you know, play with

11:09.680 --> 11:14.160
one of the hermits for a few hours. I mean, that hopefully it's not the last time but

11:14.160 --> 11:19.400
like, you know, at the very least, it's a cool experience. I'm glad I get to share it

11:19.400 --> 11:23.320
with the people on the server, because it's kind of like, you know, I really appreciate

11:23.320 --> 11:28.380
them. And I think they're all big fans. So for them, it's just gonna blow their minds.

11:28.380 --> 11:32.900
And so I just am glad to be able to share that with them. So hell yeah. Yeah, I'm just

11:32.900 --> 11:38.060
very excited. It's gonna next week. So next week, I'm filming that I don't know, I have

11:38.060 --> 11:42.500
an episode that's coming out soon. I'm actually working on I was hoping to have it done this

11:42.500 --> 11:48.460
weekend. But like, I like I have done a lot of building over the last weekend. Like I

11:48.460 --> 11:56.960
think about, gosh, 12 to 14 hours worth of Minecraft building. So I had to compress that

11:56.960 --> 12:04.240
down and to time lapses and stuff and touches a lot a lot of work, but lots of planning.

12:04.240 --> 12:09.600
I am so nervous. I've got to plan all this stuff and just get everything ready to go

12:09.600 --> 12:11.840
for Saturday or Sunday.

12:11.840 --> 12:16.720
Well, let's, let's get that plugin one more time for your YouTube channel and let let

12:16.720 --> 12:20.580
our listeners know, you know, you're you're serious about this stuff. You know, dark soccer

12:20.580 --> 12:24.420
myself, we've plugged our twitches enough. Let's I'm sure we'll plug them again at some

12:24.420 --> 12:27.820
point tonight. But Loki, make sure let's get your YouTube out there. And you know, if you

12:27.820 --> 12:31.440
guys have any interest in Minecraft, even a passing interest in Minecraft, or just like

12:31.440 --> 12:35.180
Loki, you want to hear more of his stuff. And this passion that clearly you have for

12:35.180 --> 12:38.780
it where you know, you're you're and you're really taking this next level, please, please

12:38.780 --> 12:44.420
check out Loki's YouTube, which is that it's a Loki olr is the username on there. I mean,

12:44.420 --> 12:49.280
that's pretty much me on any socials just gonna be Loki olr. So I've got a couple episodes

12:49.280 --> 12:55.420
out right now. I've got a third episode, almost done working on it right now. I'm guessing

12:55.420 --> 13:00.000
that this next episode with tango, maybe episode four or five, I haven't really decided yet

13:00.000 --> 13:03.920
because there's gonna be a lot of prep work coming up to it. Got a lot of stuff I got

13:03.920 --> 13:09.720
clean up. So there may be an episode in between there. So it's gonna be a four or five, it's

13:09.720 --> 13:13.340
gonna be so yeah, I got a peek already at Episode five.

13:13.340 --> 13:17.280
Watch it out. Loki make make his appearance like four episodes. Trust me.

13:17.280 --> 13:21.120
I can't. Well, we'll see. We'll work it in there.

13:21.120 --> 13:25.120
Or this is the foot in the door to get other content creators. And maybe they're not as

13:25.120 --> 13:28.380
and maybe they're not as big as individual.

13:28.380 --> 13:33.460
So many like, yeah, outside of hermitcraft, there's so many people that would be fun to

13:33.460 --> 13:38.560
play with. I'm really looking forward is like, I know, I mean, like, we've done like the

13:38.560 --> 13:43.360
VOG network servers and stuff, and that's fine. And it was fun playing with you guys.

13:43.360 --> 13:48.880
But like, it's hard to and even with like the people that I'm with now, it's hard to

13:48.880 --> 13:54.100
find a group of people that can play on a regular basis and that that can dedicate time

13:54.100 --> 13:59.540
to that. And I know when I joined the server, the the invite that was in the Minecraft forums

13:59.540 --> 14:03.860
was that they were looking for content creators to come on and make content together. And

14:03.860 --> 14:10.100
unfortunately, at this point, I'm like the only one doing that of the group, which is

14:10.100 --> 14:14.020
fine. Like they're still really cool people. And like, it's fun to play with them. But

14:14.020 --> 14:19.100
like, I wish it was more of that kind of content creation. There's there's other servers other

14:19.100 --> 14:24.340
than hermitcraft. Like I want to say, well, epic SMP for a little bit. But that's another

14:24.340 --> 14:28.620
example. Also, big YouTubers, big Twitch streamers went together, played Minecraft, and that

14:28.620 --> 14:33.660
died off really fast because people lost interest and went to other things. So it's just, I

14:33.660 --> 14:38.540
want somebody to like, want a group that will be dedicated to a long period of time playing

14:38.540 --> 14:44.260
this game at a level like where I'm at now and being able to collaborate and stuff more

14:44.260 --> 14:48.900
of that because I don't really do a lot of the voice chat with these folks. And it's

14:48.900 --> 14:53.120
just hard to it's hard to record too, because I'm in my kitchen. And like, honestly, like,

14:53.120 --> 14:57.380
I really need a dedicated room because I, it's hard recording all the voiceovers after

14:57.380 --> 15:02.220
the fact. And it would just be so much easier with just the editing process to do all live

15:02.220 --> 15:07.340
in from the get go. But I have to do what I can do within, you know, my limits. So

15:07.340 --> 15:12.820
Well, I think a lot of folks in the chat, like, like, they feel the enthusiasm. And

15:12.820 --> 15:16.460
I'm sure our podcast listeners, you know, even if it's like, Oh, I don't really follow

15:16.460 --> 15:20.100
Minecraft at all, you can feel the enthusiasm coming off your voice. So I know there's going

15:20.100 --> 15:23.260
to be a good video because you're obviously going to be putting like a lot of, you know,

15:23.260 --> 15:26.520
and all your videos are good because you put in this type of passion into it. But this

15:26.520 --> 15:29.740
particular one, especially because you can kind of hear that, you know, this could be

15:29.740 --> 15:32.940
like a jumping point for then, you know, maybe you get to collaborate with some other

15:32.940 --> 15:36.380
small and mid level content creators, which is great that they're looking for something

15:36.380 --> 15:39.980
that you're looking for. So this is great. I'm excited for you. I'm really excited for

15:39.980 --> 15:45.500
you. Congratulations. Thank you. If I may make a tiny suggestion, of course, what some

15:45.500 --> 15:53.100
people do for recording is they'll have like tall, like plywood and do a mini booth where

15:53.100 --> 15:59.400
you line it with the the sound dampening foam. And then that way, when you're ready to record,

15:59.400 --> 16:05.320
you just bust it out for those moments. Well, right. I get that it's not the audio quality

16:05.320 --> 16:09.920
that I'm worried about. It's the I'm in a kitchen with my children and my cat screaming

16:09.920 --> 16:14.440
and they have like that. That's what I'm talking about. Like, I just need another room in the

16:14.440 --> 16:21.520
house, which we don't have. We don't we have a bathroom one that will not work. I need

16:21.520 --> 16:24.880
I need to build in a garage. Are you on a laptop? Because you could come use the oil

16:24.880 --> 16:29.520
or you could use Studio N seven. We're vaccinated. I'm on a laptop. But like, think about it.

16:29.520 --> 16:33.080
It's I just need to build a room in the garage. It really that's what it comes down to. But

16:33.080 --> 16:37.400
that that's the hard part. It's like I even like trying to record voiceovers. I was trying

16:37.400 --> 16:42.820
to do that yesterday. And the cat, even though she has no sense of hearing, she has a sense

16:42.820 --> 16:48.400
of timing where she just knows that I'm doing a video conference or something. It's like

16:48.400 --> 16:52.720
comes in, starts screaming. I'm like, great. Thank you for writing my voice over. It's

16:52.720 --> 16:57.440
like, I don't know. All right. Well, fingers, fingers crossed. But this this also begs another

16:57.440 --> 17:00.960
question. Okay, so so here we are in 2021. And I noticed there's there's there's lots

17:00.960 --> 17:06.060
of community things happening. So Loki, obviously, really, you know, starting to jumpstart these

17:06.060 --> 17:10.760
things he's doing with the Minecraft community and getting very involved with that dark Sakura.

17:10.760 --> 17:15.600
I can't watch a Dead by Daylight streamer on Twitch without running into you and chat

17:15.600 --> 17:20.340
anymore. And you obviously doing a lot more streaming yourself and getting to know a lot

17:20.340 --> 17:24.120
of those people in that community. And I think making a name for yourself in the Dead

17:24.120 --> 17:29.860
by Daylight community. It just came out this week. VOG Network's own Bobby Blackwolf has

17:29.860 --> 17:34.180
been involved with the speedrunning community and doing awesome Games Done Quick and Summer

17:34.180 --> 17:38.360
Games Done Quick is coming up. And did you all know VOG Network's own Bobby Blackwolf

17:38.360 --> 17:41.740
is going to be doing the finale at Summer Games Done Quick this year. It's going to

17:41.740 --> 17:46.620
be is going to be hosting the Kingdom Hearts 2. And yes, it's not it's not about the host.

17:46.620 --> 17:51.740
It's about the charity. It's about the speedrunners. But I still think that's so cool. You know,

17:51.740 --> 17:57.060
like just even be like, just to even be like affiliated with that or whatever is just so

17:57.060 --> 18:07.820
cool. What do I have? You guys have been streaming a lot of stuff. You and Alan. I mean, Alan.

18:07.820 --> 18:15.120
Yes. Alan has a lot of stuff too. What do I have? Rob? Oh, that's right. OK. Pixel

18:15.120 --> 18:21.480
Pacas reminded me I won a fake survivor game two years ago. That is right. When the Resident

18:21.480 --> 18:28.600
Evil chapter comes out. Yeah. I said that that would pop my survivor cherry. Mm hmm.

18:28.600 --> 18:34.880
So I have to do a swift with you and Alan. OK. OK. I'm so down for that. I was doing

18:34.880 --> 18:39.620
a swift without which means survive with friends. I was doing that with Alan the other night

18:39.620 --> 18:45.100
and we had a good time. Yeah. I think playing together were also I'm a higher rank survivor

18:45.100 --> 18:49.980
than him. And I don't know how that happened. I really don't. I should. I just don't think

18:49.980 --> 18:55.940
I'm going to suck at Survivor because I'm not altruistic. See it to be in chat says,

18:55.940 --> 18:58.900
girl, you're amazing. Just the way you are. Thank you so much. No, I swear I wasn't fishing

18:58.900 --> 19:03.580
for compliments. It was just a really funny opportunity for me to crack a joke. I have

19:03.580 --> 19:07.340
the Dragon Con panel stuff coming up. And, you know, as conventions come back, I'll do

19:07.340 --> 19:11.580
more and more of that panel hosting stuff. Live hosting is a thing I'm super into. So,

19:11.580 --> 19:16.100
you know, I'm teasing. But there are some things I'm into that I'm thrilled to be affiliated

19:16.100 --> 19:20.540
with. And honestly, I am giving some thought. I don't know if I should vocalize this on

19:20.540 --> 19:24.460
O.L.R. because if I do it, I'm committed to it. But I'm really giving a thought on dipping

19:24.460 --> 19:32.300
my toe back into really embracing retro games and doing more with retro stuff and NES classics

19:32.300 --> 19:36.560
that I grew up with. If any of you have followed my personal YouTube channel, then like five,

19:36.560 --> 19:43.240
six years ago, God, probably longer, I had started this concept of, you know, let's remember

19:43.240 --> 19:47.440
where I would play some old games and really not just like kind of talk, but really like

19:47.440 --> 19:51.280
do a deep dive into like memories with these old games. And, you know, a little different

19:51.280 --> 19:54.600
from like, you know, classic game or anything else is that it's like I'm experiencing the

19:54.600 --> 19:58.200
game while kind of relishing in some of the memories of the game. And I'm really thinking

19:58.200 --> 20:03.500
about maybe bringing that back actually as like maybe a VOG project. I don't know. Maybe

20:03.500 --> 20:07.860
personal channel, maybe VOG. I don't know. I haven't decided yet. But yeah. So that might

20:07.860 --> 20:14.100
be it. Maybe I'll get in more with the retro community. We'll see. We'll see. So. All right.

20:14.100 --> 20:19.060
SSJ100Matt in chat says it's been a year plus for a lot of folks. Finding that inspiration

20:19.060 --> 20:24.420
is harder or easier for some folk and of course, differently. You do you. Yeah. I think that's

20:24.420 --> 20:29.540
very good advice. It really is. Okay. So that was a long intro. We still haven't even gotten

20:29.540 --> 20:32.900
to our kickoff topic. But no, that was we needed that update from Loki. That's really

20:32.900 --> 20:38.320
exciting news. Let's talk about some of the news we missed last week. So we weren't here

20:38.320 --> 20:45.620
last week, obviously. And we missed some news. Although with E3 and Summer Game Fest and

20:45.620 --> 20:50.700
all that coming up in this next week, obviously the news has been a little bit light, not

20:50.700 --> 20:54.260
just last week, but this week as well, just because a lot of the big announcements. Next

20:54.260 --> 20:58.580
week's show will be huge because we're going to have a fun show tonight, too. But next

20:58.580 --> 21:03.980
week's show, especially because, you know, the Xbox Bethesda big event is in the morning.

21:03.980 --> 21:08.320
For years and years here at OLR, we've had to go up against Bethesda during E3. They're

21:08.320 --> 21:12.220
at the same time. But now that they're part of Microsoft, they're going in Microsoft spot.

21:12.220 --> 21:15.260
So they're going to have a big event earlier in the day. So we'll have a lot to talk about

21:15.260 --> 21:21.740
on next week's show. In the last week, so before the week we were off, we did miss a

21:21.740 --> 21:26.340
few big things. And I want to talk about some of those. So one of them was the Dragon Quest

21:26.340 --> 21:30.900
35th anniversary stream. Did anyone catch some of the headlines or some of the key stuff

21:30.900 --> 21:34.900
from this stream? Because there's some good stuff that came out of this, such as confirmation

21:34.900 --> 21:40.220
that Dragon Quest 12 is coming. It's called The Flames of Fate. And I believe I believe

21:40.220 --> 21:43.980
the way they phrased it was that it's going to be a fabulous flames of hate. No, it's

21:43.980 --> 21:51.100
not the fabulous flames of hate, but it's it's it's a more adult version of Dragon Quest,

21:51.100 --> 21:54.620
apparently, which is an interesting way. And I wonder if that's sort of a thing where it's

21:54.660 --> 21:58.860
like, well, you know, a lot of you have kind of grown up with this series. It also kind

21:58.860 --> 22:03.940
of made me think of like Yakuza like a dragon, where like growing up with Dragon Quest has

22:03.940 --> 22:08.500
been it was has been a sort of a plot device. So not that I'm saying that Dragon Quest 12

22:08.500 --> 22:13.140
is going to be like Yakuza, but I can't help but feel like maybe some of the creative direction

22:13.140 --> 22:19.220
to kind of make it a more adult series is because of Dragon Quest influence in mainstream

22:19.220 --> 22:27.140
as well as gaming culture. I think it could be interesting. So and Mike Deft in chat,

22:27.140 --> 22:31.820
who's gone through a rebrand recently, it appears, says it's going to be a more dark

22:31.820 --> 22:37.420
adult Dragon Quest. I'm OK. You know what? Dragon Quest has had a very cartoony look

22:37.420 --> 22:41.940
for a long time, and I realize that's a hallmark of the franchise, but I'm OK with them going

22:41.940 --> 22:45.100
a little bit of a darker direction with it. I think that could be interesting. I just

22:45.100 --> 22:52.540
hope they get a new composer. And let's see, what else do we have a Dragon Quest? Oh, yes.

22:52.540 --> 22:58.300
Dragon Quest three is getting an HD remake and it looks really good to 2D remake and

22:58.300 --> 23:02.980
it looks really good. And that is a lot of people going, why can't they do this to the

23:02.980 --> 23:08.020
Final Fantasy or Chrono Trigger series as well? Hey, well, you know what? If this sells

23:08.020 --> 23:13.020
really well, I bet they'll consider it. So, I mean, you know, if this is at all interesting

23:13.020 --> 23:16.860
to you, you might want to buy it. Yuji Horii apparently considering giving Dragon Quest

23:16.860 --> 23:21.620
one and two the same treatment. So fingers and toes crossed on that. There were some

23:21.620 --> 23:25.100
other things announced. I think the other big thing for me, I'm not going to talk about

23:25.100 --> 23:30.940
everything they said in that, but I think for me, Dragon Quest 10 offline was announced.

23:30.940 --> 23:34.700
So Dragon Quest 10 has been an MMO. It's been online, right? And I think they're getting

23:34.700 --> 23:40.240
a new version six expansion even. It's still going. But we have yet to experience it in

23:40.240 --> 23:45.900
America. And I don't they didn't say the Dragon Quest 10 offline is coming to America.

23:45.900 --> 23:51.160
But in my head, I'm like, that's how they're going to do it. They get this game out and

23:51.160 --> 23:55.420
they can localize it. And that's how we'll get Dragon Quest 10 here in America. I think

23:55.420 --> 24:00.720
I'm jumping to conclusions a little bit. But the news of a Dragon Quest 10 offline coming

24:00.720 --> 24:06.640
is pretty exciting, I think. So we'll see. Any interest from you guys in playing offline

24:06.640 --> 24:10.160
version of Dragon Quest? I mean, I'd love to play the online one, but I think the reality

24:10.160 --> 24:16.600
is, is never going to be localized or available to come out here. I'm not really a Dragon

24:16.600 --> 24:22.800
Quest fan, so probably not. I haven't played Dragon Quest since Dragon Quest. We you should

24:22.800 --> 24:28.200
check out. Eleven isn't bad, but, you know, it had it had some things that, you know,

24:28.200 --> 24:31.960
but I think this direction they're going with with twelve will be a great thing for the

24:31.960 --> 24:36.580
series. They did announce what platforms twelve is going to be on, though, which was interesting.

24:36.580 --> 24:40.860
Usually they tell us pretty early, so we don't know if it's a Switch game, PlayStation 5

24:40.860 --> 24:46.500
game or what or an Xbox game. You know, we don't know. So stay tuned for more information

24:46.500 --> 24:50.820
on that, I suppose. So let's see. So other news that we missed last week. The Dragon

24:50.820 --> 24:56.740
Quest announcement was the big one. Sonic also had a stream on May 27th, and they're

24:56.740 --> 25:02.100
going to be doing like an orchestral, orchestral Sonic performance during Summer Game Fest.

25:02.100 --> 25:06.900
I think that's coming up in the next few days when there's a compilation called Sonic

25:06.900 --> 25:12.540
Origins that's going to be coming to the more current systems. Sega loves to put their retro

25:12.540 --> 25:16.340
stuff, especially Sonic, on consoles every single time. So this really shouldn't be a

25:16.340 --> 25:23.420
surprise, but it'll be nice. Olympic Games Tokyo 2020, the official video game, got a

25:23.420 --> 25:29.100
new Sonic the Hedgehog costume. So it looks so ridiculous. The game for the Olympics that

25:29.100 --> 25:32.940
didn't happen when they were supposed to happen. And it says this is the official Olympics

25:32.940 --> 25:36.580
games, not like Mario and Sonic at the Olympics. So that's why it's ridiculous. Yes, that's

25:36.580 --> 25:41.360
why it's ridiculous. And then obviously the big thing that had everybody talking, a teaser

25:41.360 --> 25:47.020
for a new mainline Sonic game. No title. We know it's 2022. We know it's going to be on

25:47.020 --> 25:51.940
the Switch, but that's about all we know as of right now. So we're just kind of fingers

25:51.940 --> 25:56.980
and toes crossed. It's a little more. Where was it? Sonic Mania and a little less Sonic

25:56.980 --> 26:02.980
the Hedgehog part? Well, the mix of the update for Sonic Colors. So Sonic Colors Ultimate

26:02.980 --> 26:07.460
was something else. OK. Oh, I think I missed that in the list. Thank you. So, yeah, because

26:07.460 --> 26:12.300
I did watch this, actually, because I caught it like it happened in the pop up on my YouTube

26:12.300 --> 26:19.740
feed. But it yeah, it's interesting. Just the new Sonic game they tease like, you know,

26:19.740 --> 26:24.220
sounded interesting. Sonic Colors I never really played because that was I think that

26:24.220 --> 26:31.460
was a Wii U game. I can't remember, but it looks good. You know, good remaster, I guess.

26:31.460 --> 26:36.580
Some other announcements from the week we were off. There is a Kunio-kun, which of course

26:36.580 --> 26:40.660
you might know as like the River City Ransom, Super Dodgeball type of games that's going

26:40.660 --> 26:46.060
to be doing a 35th anniversary project. So then those those games, they kind of re-release

26:46.060 --> 26:49.740
not that long ago as well. So it's nice to see that there's still a lot of love for that

26:49.740 --> 26:56.980
series. Super Bomberman Online Cross Fall Guys can be a crossover going on there. Shiva

26:56.980 --> 27:04.620
will be joining Streets of Rage 4 in the Mr. X Nightmare DLC. And probably the other biggest,

27:04.620 --> 27:09.960
biggest headline from last week when we were off, no BlizzCon this year. Blizzard announced

27:09.960 --> 27:14.820
they're not going to be doing a BlizzCon this year, which is in contrast to some other.

27:14.820 --> 27:18.780
I mean, I don't know if this is because BlizzCon is in California, which has been a little

27:18.820 --> 27:24.220
slower to reopen, but some other conventions in this same week, such as DragonCon, have

27:24.220 --> 27:28.060
announced that they're essentially going, I don't want to say full steam ahead with

27:28.060 --> 27:34.060
the convention, but that in-person is part of their plan. I sort of have the gut feeling

27:34.060 --> 27:37.140
they're going to, it's, it'll still be kind of a different DragonCon and they're probably

27:37.140 --> 27:41.420
expecting less people because there will, they are still pouring everything into having

27:41.420 --> 27:46.700
a virtual component as well. So people will have the choice between the two. I caught

27:46.700 --> 27:54.580
in chat earlier, MagFest confirmed they're coming back in person January 2022. But Blizzard

27:54.580 --> 28:01.420
has decided not for them this year. So they're going to be doing an online event instead.

28:01.420 --> 28:06.980
And executive producer of BlizzCon in a statement, Sarah Lynn Smith said, the ongoing complexities

28:06.980 --> 28:11.060
and uncertainties of the pandemic have impacted our ability to properly move forward on any

28:11.060 --> 28:15.460
of these fronts. And ultimately we're now past the point where we'd be able to develop

28:15.500 --> 28:20.100
the kind of event we'd want to create for you in November. That's an interesting perspective

28:20.100 --> 28:27.100
too is that honestly, to do BlizzCon in November, that planning starts in like February or March.

28:27.100 --> 28:32.260
It takes a long time to put on a BlizzCon. So I can understand for sure the perspective

28:32.260 --> 28:38.920
of they don't want to do all this planning and then, oh shit, September, October, a variant

28:38.920 --> 28:43.460
is loose or something. I mean, I hope it doesn't happen, but we have to be prepared mentally

28:43.460 --> 28:47.620
that might. And then they just got to shut down BlizzCon all over again. And I can sort

28:47.620 --> 28:53.820
of see where maybe they also just don't have a lot to say because they've already had to

28:53.820 --> 29:00.100
kind of delay stuff, right? We know Diablo 4, not till next year. Overwatch 2, not till

29:00.100 --> 29:07.300
next year. Diablo 2, we get this year. But we had a virtual BlizzCon, what, March? Which

29:07.300 --> 29:12.220
was kind of delayed from last November. So maybe they're just not ready. But they will

29:12.220 --> 29:18.500
be doing a virtual BlizzCon line instead. They're also talking about smaller in-person

29:18.500 --> 29:22.500
gatherings and that's kind of interesting too. That maybe they'll have like satellite

29:22.500 --> 29:29.340
meetups and stuff like that. But keep an eye on that. So no BlizzCon 2021, but a BlizzCon

29:29.340 --> 29:35.660
line sounds like it'll be a thing. SSG100Matt in chat says, kind of wish they pushed Magfest

29:35.660 --> 29:41.200
to February again because everyone liked February Mag. Yeah, consider me one of those people.

29:41.200 --> 29:47.960
But I don't know if realistically January Magfest can be in the cards for me. I don't

29:47.960 --> 29:53.800
want to rule it out yet, but there's a lot going on personally where I don't think it's

29:53.800 --> 29:57.240
going to be a great idea for me. And when I can tell you more about what's going on,

29:57.240 --> 30:02.560
I think you'll understand. But I hope MagWest comes back next summer because I'd like to

30:02.560 --> 30:08.800
go to that for a change. That'd be nice. So, all right. Let's move on. We've talked about

30:08.800 --> 30:13.520
what happened last week in gaming. Let's talk a little bit about the next week before

30:13.520 --> 30:17.920
we get into our gaming weeks. We've kind of mentioned a couple of times now, but just

30:17.920 --> 30:23.640
another reminder, it's E3 week coming up. And this year we also have Summer Game Fest

30:23.640 --> 30:28.040
happening at the same time. So you have kind of two big events happening and that means

30:28.040 --> 30:34.120
all these other smaller events that are going on for really the summer. Here's some things

30:34.120 --> 30:38.480
to look forward to in the coming weeks. The official Battlefield reveal. I think we'll

30:38.480 --> 30:42.160
be talking a little bit more about this later in the show, but I'll just say quickly, more

30:42.160 --> 30:48.640
information on the next Battlefield game June 9th or Wednesday. That's at 7 o'clock Pacific

30:48.640 --> 30:57.360
time. Summer Game Fest, 11 a.m. Pacific time and that would be 2 p.m. Eastern time on Thursday.

30:57.360 --> 31:02.240
This will be Geoff Keighley's event. So the people that brought you the game awards. Weezer

31:02.240 --> 31:06.280
is going to be playing for whatever reason. But yeah, that's cool. Weezer's cool. Whatever.

31:06.280 --> 31:12.320
Awesome. Folks like the studio behind Among Us will be unveiling something. Could that

31:12.320 --> 31:16.960
be a new map? Could that be a new game? Don't know. We'll see. But check that out. That

31:16.960 --> 31:22.600
will all be on Thursday. Also, another Geoff Keighley event as part of Summer Games Fest

31:22.600 --> 31:29.660
will be on Friday at 9 a.m. Pacific, noon. This is a Geoff Keighley and Netflix collaboration.

31:29.660 --> 31:34.040
And as you guys know, Netflix has really been dipping their toe into gaming, right? The

31:34.040 --> 31:37.920
Witcher does well and that which technically the Witcher was a book. But I think we all

31:37.920 --> 31:42.260
know the look at this. Obviously, the fact that it was a game really propelled it to

31:42.260 --> 31:47.280
being a series. And so now Netflix between that and the Castlevania anime doing like

31:47.280 --> 31:53.400
Netflix is like full on fucking gaming media now, like all these, which is great. Have

31:53.400 --> 31:59.040
you seen the brand new trailer? Like I'm not a huge fan of Dynasty Wars, but that trailer?

31:59.040 --> 32:06.800
No, I didn't. It's a live action like it's a live action Dynasty Warriors. And it's it's

32:06.800 --> 32:11.680
amazing. It takes me back to when I used to go to Fanime and watch all the late night

32:11.680 --> 32:17.720
like Kung Fu, Hong Kong cinema stuff. Wow. Oh, my God. It's so amazing. Like I need to

32:17.720 --> 32:22.460
watch that. OK, check this out. This is what this is. What's on the list for them to talk

32:22.460 --> 32:27.960
about at this Netflix event on Friday? Cyberpunk 2077 because there's that Edgerunners anime

32:27.960 --> 32:34.560
is having Tomb Raider, Assassin's Creed, Devil May Cry, Dota 2, League of Legends,

32:34.560 --> 32:39.740
Beyond Good and Evil, Dragon's Dogma, Sonic the Hedgehog, which I don't think that's related

32:39.740 --> 32:42.920
to the movie, but I guess there must be a series I completely forgot about or anime

32:42.920 --> 32:47.160
or something. It was part of the it was part of the Sonic event that they talked about.

32:47.160 --> 32:53.560
They're doing a new series. It's about it's based on colors or the Sonic Color stuff.

32:53.560 --> 32:59.000
Well, there you go. That's a lot. That's a lot of media based on video games. And they're

32:59.000 --> 33:03.660
saying more and more, probably some new announcements out of this as well. The things we don't even

33:03.660 --> 33:08.680
know about yet. Come on, Tron. Come on, Tron. I guess I guess Tron was really a movie before

33:08.680 --> 33:12.840
it was a game, but they could put it in there and get away with it. Right. Also, Tron would

33:12.840 --> 33:17.560
really be Disney Plus. So I'm really rooting for the wrong thing. I just love Tron so much.

33:17.560 --> 33:22.760
OK, they had an awesome anime Tron series and they did. They canceled it like they kept

33:22.760 --> 33:29.720
my movies. Maybe. OK. All right. You really want to get tin foil hat? You really? OK,

33:29.720 --> 33:34.760
here we go. Making my predictions. Subscribe to my YouTube channel. Here we go. How about

33:34.760 --> 33:44.200
that long, long rumored Zelda series for Netflix? Wouldn't that be the flack on the table for

33:44.200 --> 33:52.680
all of E3? That's just like that. That's so like IGN April Fool's Day content right there.

33:52.840 --> 34:00.280
Like I've already been disappointed too many times with that. Like, I don't. Yeah, we'll see.

34:00.280 --> 34:05.960
S2 and Hunter Mountain chat says Half-Life three, the movie. Hey, hey. Might as well. We're throwing

34:05.960 --> 34:09.960
out all these impossible things. Sure. Why not? Why not? Why not? All right. The movie.

34:09.960 --> 34:14.520
Getting into some other stuff. OK, so then E3 star. Oh, actually, I want to shout out the

34:14.520 --> 34:18.360
wholesome direct because I think that's really adorable and it's an indie thing. We love our

34:18.360 --> 34:23.720
indies. That is on Saturday at 10 a.m. Pacific. I have to do math in my head. 1 p.m. Eastern.

34:24.280 --> 34:30.280
That is at Wholesome Games dot com. Seventy five feel good indie games. That's if you want to wrap

34:30.280 --> 34:35.960
yourself up in indie games and give yourself a hug. Wholesome Direct on Saturday. Ubisoft

34:35.960 --> 34:42.360
11 a.m. on Saturday. Don't know exactly what they'll be talking about. I guess Trackmania

34:43.160 --> 34:48.040
and surely some new games in their other franchises as well. I'm sorry. The pre-show

34:48.040 --> 34:56.600
is at 11. The show show is at noon. So there's there's two Ubisoft shows. So Devolver Digital

34:56.600 --> 35:04.280
will be doing things on Saturday at 1 30 Pacific, 4 30 Eastern Devolver Digital. They they're crazy

35:04.280 --> 35:09.960
and in a good way. And I think there'll be a lot of fun to watch there. Their E3 thing last year

35:10.040 --> 35:16.200
was the best thing that like first person exploring thing that they did. Did you guys

35:16.200 --> 35:19.960
already forget about that? That game they released on Steam that was like their E3. That was the best

35:19.960 --> 35:26.440
thing ever. That was awesome. Gearbox is doing something on Saturday, but we don't know when.

35:26.440 --> 35:31.240
We do know that there were those little teasers from the Borderlands movie. So I don't know if

35:31.240 --> 35:36.040
maybe something's crossing over there, but we saw the very shadowy figures of the actors in their

35:36.040 --> 35:44.760
costumes. So, hmm, hmm. Sunday, 10 a.m. Pacific, 1 p.m. Eastern, Xbox and Bethesda. That's going

35:44.760 --> 35:51.880
to be a big one. I'm very excited for that. I'm hoping we can simulcast it here at VOG

35:51.880 --> 35:57.160
that they will allow us to do a co-stream. If so, I will be on there and whoever. I'm sure Bobby

35:57.160 --> 36:01.160
will join me and Loki and Dark Soccer are more than welcome if they want to do some running

36:01.160 --> 36:06.920
commentary with that. That's if we are allowed to co-stream. If they do not give express permission

36:06.920 --> 36:11.960
for that, then we'll just be in chat and host it and give our reactions that way. So that'll be fun.

36:11.960 --> 36:18.200
The PC gaming show. This show has been kind of garbage. I'm going to be honest, not usually a

36:18.200 --> 36:23.000
lot to look forward to. Will this be the year they change it around? Maybe 11 a.m. Pacific,

36:23.000 --> 36:30.120
2 p.m. Eastern. Loki, am I right? The PC thing is usually kind of stupid. I'm sorry, but they need

36:30.120 --> 36:35.880
to kick it up a notch. Square Enix ought to be a little more exciting and that will be it. This is

36:35.880 --> 36:44.440
an odd time. 1215 Pacific, 315 Eastern on Sunday as well. So that's kind of cool. And then that's

36:44.440 --> 36:50.520
it for the big ones on Sunday. And then let's see. Oh no, I'm sorry. Warner Brothers still is TBA,

36:50.520 --> 36:55.240
so they might do something. I don't know. Limited Run Games. So I'm sure they're going to put

36:55.240 --> 36:59.240
together some more cartridges you have to own. That is going to be at one o'clock Pacific,

36:59.320 --> 37:05.080
four o'clock Eastern on Monday. Take Two is going to do something on Monday. Capcom is doing

37:05.080 --> 37:11.320
something on Monday. And then we get to Tuesday, the Nintendo Direct. This is going to be one for

37:11.320 --> 37:18.520
the ages. Hopefully we're not hyping it up too much, but I hope this is it. Tuesday 9 a.m. Pacific.

37:20.200 --> 37:26.120
All of the Pikmin games. All of them. Like Pikmin, they're going to have Pikmin 5 through 20. It's

37:26.120 --> 37:31.880
just going to be one afternoon. Pikmin, Pikmin, Pikmin. I think they really and I, you know,

37:31.880 --> 37:37.560
I don't like to set the bar. They they have to update us on Breath of the Wild 2. Like they

37:37.560 --> 37:44.360
have to. I'm sorry. Prime 4 and all the other games that they've teased. You know what? The

37:44.360 --> 37:49.640
Zelda one is more important, in my opinion. Like the Zelda one, they have to update people on that.

37:50.920 --> 37:54.920
If at least they do that, I think they can get away without saying Bayonetta 3 for another

37:54.920 --> 37:59.320
Direct. But I think there's a huge expectation. We've got to get an update on Breath of the Wild

37:59.320 --> 38:04.440
2. And I fully understand we might not get it, but there's that. I'll come out on the next console.

38:05.080 --> 38:11.320
Now Bobby is also saying, note the Nintendo Direct is just about software. That's a good reminder.

38:11.320 --> 38:16.840
In their tweet, they said software only. And all these things that said Switch Pro, it's going to

38:16.840 --> 38:20.280
be revealed Thursday. No, no, no. It's going to be revealed Friday. Well, guess what? It still

38:20.280 --> 38:25.800
ain't fucking here. So this is a big red flag that maybe Nintendo is not doing the Switch Pro

38:25.800 --> 38:32.520
this year. And I think we all need to maybe and you know what, Loki? I think we have to give them

38:32.520 --> 38:36.600
credit if they made this decision. Maybe they realized they weren't going to be able to make

38:36.600 --> 38:40.680
enough of them because of all these hardware shortages. And so they've decided not to try

38:40.680 --> 38:46.520
this year. You assume they learned something. They didn't learn anything. They're just good.

38:46.520 --> 38:50.760
They'll still announce it. It'll be like so far in the future. And they still won't have it could

38:50.760 --> 38:56.120
be a perfect world where we have we're literally drowning in silicon. And they would still find

38:56.120 --> 39:02.600
some way to short that thing. Like I don't buy for one second, that no matter when they announce it,

39:02.600 --> 39:07.560
that there won't be shortages. And they will be completely incompetent with their, you know,

39:07.560 --> 39:13.480
retail flow or whatever. I just, whatever. Um, Bobby Blackwood and chat says, so let me ask

39:13.480 --> 39:20.040
this. Why do we need an update on Breath of the Wild 2? It's been a long time. And I know you're

39:20.040 --> 39:24.360
not going to accept that answer because Nintendo can really put this out whenever they want and

39:24.360 --> 39:32.280
people will eat it up. But I think to an extent, the Zelda fan base is very loyal. It's very large.

39:32.280 --> 39:38.680
Breath of the Wild really propelled the Switch to its early success. Even though it was a Wii U game,

39:39.640 --> 39:46.520
it really made its case for the Switch very well. And I almost think to go this long without giving

39:46.520 --> 39:52.120
the fans even a peek at what's going on, I think is starting to insult the fan base. I'm going to

39:52.120 --> 39:58.200
just be very clear. And I know that answer is going to be controversial. But I think with things

39:58.200 --> 40:03.640
having gone on this long to not even give a peek or an update or a hint of what's going on or what

40:03.640 --> 40:08.680
to expect or what the game's going to look like or what I think it's just insulting at this point

40:08.680 --> 40:13.320
if we go past, uh, another year. Cause when did they, I don't, I can't even remember when they

40:13.320 --> 40:22.120
did the first reveal. Was it the games, uh, awards 2018 or something like that? I don't know. Anyway.

40:22.920 --> 40:26.760
Um, Bobby and chat says, I've never heard of someone not buying a game because they didn't

40:26.760 --> 40:33.160
get an update at a specific time. Again, I, I understand that at the end of the day,

40:33.240 --> 40:35.960
they're going to release the game. They could just say, Oh, it's out tomorrow,

40:35.960 --> 40:41.320
thwack. And it'll still sell pretty good, but will it sell breath of the wild good

40:41.320 --> 40:50.120
or will it sell skyward sword? Good. I don't know. Anyway. All right. But there is something

40:50.120 --> 40:52.920
you're underestimating though. Bobby who says I would have bought breath of the wild too,

40:52.920 --> 40:56.920
when it came out, but since they didn't give us any info at E3 2020, I'm not pre-orders

40:56.920 --> 41:03.960
and the industry puts a lot of stock in that. So anyway, I'm going to move on. Uh,

41:05.960 --> 41:08.920
what was, uh, let's see. I want to see if there's anything else on this. Usually

41:08.920 --> 41:14.520
Nintendo is kind of the end of like the big E3 week, but I guess Bandai Namco

41:14.520 --> 41:19.480
is also doing something on Tuesday. We just don't know what time, uh, Elden Ring is still

41:19.480 --> 41:23.880
sort of that it's hanging out there. We don't really know like what's going on with that.

41:23.880 --> 41:31.960
Who knows? Um, there is a Steam Next Fest starting on Wednesday. So Valve doing a virtual

41:31.960 --> 41:36.040
festival that will have demos and things like that within the Steam store, who knows if they'll

41:36.040 --> 41:40.440
be doing anything themselves within Steam that is on the 16th. As we start to get further and

41:40.440 --> 41:45.320
further out, we get to Wednesday, the 23rd of June, where the Sonic Symphony Orchestra

41:45.320 --> 41:50.040
that before, uh, mentioned Sonic stream earlier in the show that is actually happening on June 23rd.

41:50.120 --> 41:55.480
The Microsoft Windows reveal is happening on June 24th. And then, uh, of course,

41:55.480 --> 42:01.800
Summer Games Done Quick starts on the 4th of July and, uh, let's see, what else do we have way out?

42:01.800 --> 42:08.680
OEA Play is, uh, July 22nd. So lots and lots to look forward to throughout the summer,

42:08.680 --> 42:13.160
but it's going to be a busy week next week. Uh, and especially as we get into the week after that

42:13.160 --> 42:17.400
as well. So we're going to finally be talking about a lot of new games, uh, in the coming weeks

42:17.400 --> 42:22.280
here at OLR. But for now, let's talk about the games that we have been playing this past week,

42:22.280 --> 42:25.960
uh, or I suppose two weeks if you want, in the segment called How Is Your Gaming Week?

42:25.960 --> 42:31.400
Let's go to Dark Sakura. I have been playing a lot of Dead by Daylight. I'm trying to get better,

42:32.120 --> 42:38.200
and I'm trying to get that face thing for Plague at the end of, uh, the third, uh,

42:39.880 --> 42:47.240
whatever the tome thing is. Oh, yeah. Yeah. The Rift. Yeah. The Rift. Um,

42:48.280 --> 42:53.400
and I've, of course, been playing Fantasian, um, really enjoying Fantasian, just trying to

42:54.440 --> 42:59.320
explore and take my time with it while, you know, I've got folks watching. Um,

43:00.440 --> 43:07.800
I've been playing Wardscape still, um, um, playing Animal Crossing. Um, so those are all my usuals.

43:07.800 --> 43:17.560
Um, I did, I'm actually going to be trying down the line some, uh, uh, Mario 64 ROM hacks. I

43:17.560 --> 43:21.800
haven't decided which one I want to start with, but those are going to be coming up as soon as I

43:21.800 --> 43:28.040
can get something that will work on my Mac. Nice. Oh, and Guns N' Roses Pinball.

43:30.040 --> 43:36.200
Of course, Pinball. Of course, Pinball. All right. Um, let's move on. Uh, Loki,

43:36.200 --> 43:40.200
how was your gaming week? Um, my gaming week was, like I said, you know,

43:40.200 --> 43:46.600
it's pretty much been Minecraft. I did play occasionally some Orna when I go places. Um,

43:46.600 --> 43:52.280
but that's pretty much it. It's just been, just been Minecraft. You've really been pouring a lot

43:52.280 --> 43:59.480
into Minecraft, huh? Yes. I, this week. So like I built my shop in our shopping district, which is

43:59.480 --> 44:05.320
enormous. So they'll be in the next video. And there was a, another community challenge was the

44:05.320 --> 44:11.160
one chunk build challenge. So I built a giant redstone rollercoaster in that. And so it's

44:11.160 --> 44:16.840
incredibly elaborate, um, also in the video. So, um, that'll be coming soon. You can see

44:16.840 --> 44:24.520
all the stuff I worked on this week. All right. Uh, let's see my gaming week. Um,

44:24.520 --> 44:29.160
I, a lot of the same stuff, honestly, still been going in dead by daylight myself. Um,

44:29.160 --> 44:33.800
uh, got my survivor up to rank eight. So I feel like I'm, which is weird because I don't have all

44:33.800 --> 44:40.120
the talents you really need, but, um, I've gotten pretty good at hunting totems and, uh, for better

44:40.120 --> 44:43.400
for worse, when haunted ground is in play for those that play the game. Uh, and I'm getting

44:43.400 --> 44:47.800
really good at evading. Uh, I'm sorry, not like looping. When I get in the chase with the killer,

44:47.800 --> 44:53.080
I kinda start to flop. I need to get better at looping killers. Although, uh, at the killer

44:53.080 --> 44:56.840
shack, I'm getting better because that's like the easiest place to loop a killer. So I'm getting

44:56.840 --> 45:01.640
better at looping a killer shack. Um, and if you don't know what all this stuff means, uh, watch

45:01.640 --> 45:06.120
one of dark Sakura streams or, or one of the many people that streamed dead by daylight here, um,

45:06.120 --> 45:10.040
or one of these days I'll finally freaking stream, uh, Alan alchemy. Of course, my husband does a lot

45:10.040 --> 45:16.200
of great streams too with a dead by daylight. Um, but, uh, um, I'm getting a little better with

45:16.200 --> 45:20.760
that, but I'm pretty good at being stealth in the first place and just not getting caught by the

45:20.760 --> 45:25.880
killer. Um, however, you don't get a lot of points by doing that. And I wish, I wish the game did

45:25.880 --> 45:30.520
reward stealth play a little more. Um, but you really have to be like willing to rescue people

45:30.520 --> 45:36.440
from hooks and be what they call altruistic in the game, um, to, uh, really, uh, up your, um,

45:36.440 --> 45:41.320
points. So I've been playing that. Um, I've also been playing, of course, Final Fantasy 14 still,

45:41.320 --> 45:46.520
I did Pokemon go community day today. There was a huge Pokemon go community day today. It was gibble,

45:46.520 --> 45:50.600
which is one that the fans, you know, it's a pretty rare to spawn Pokemon. And I think this

45:50.600 --> 45:55.400
is one that the fans have been requesting for some time. So I think this was a good time with, um,

45:55.400 --> 45:59.800
you know, COVID restrictions starting to ease and of course outdoor activity is, you know,

45:59.800 --> 46:06.360
really safe, you know, uh, at least if you listen to the CDC, um, this was a great day to do that,

46:06.360 --> 46:11.800
uh, to kind of like welcome people back to Pokemon go. Um, I caught 10 shinies in like 90 minutes and

46:11.800 --> 46:16.360
that was enough for me. I already had two shiny gibles. So I was a little sad that those got

46:16.360 --> 46:21.080
devalued, but that's all right. Uh, I caught 10 more shinies and decided to call it a day,

46:21.080 --> 46:27.320
by the way, if you want to know, Oh yes. And I think, uh, yeah. Uh, Mike Defton chat says

46:27.320 --> 46:33.240
I went all Shane and got 42. Oh, y'all want to hear the text message from Shane? Hold on. I got

46:33.240 --> 46:42.040
it. Ended at 59. I wanted one more so you can have a nice round number. I suppose 59 shinies.

46:42.040 --> 46:47.160
That guy caught, wow. Uh, I was fine with 10. That was, that was enough for me. I don't know what I

46:47.160 --> 46:52.760
would do at 59 shinies. So, all right. Uh, but gibble, I do love the shiny gibble. And remember

46:52.760 --> 46:57.480
for those that know, Shane, the shiny gibble is blue, which is also, you know, another.

46:57.480 --> 47:02.760
Oh, well that says it all right there. Exactly. Right. Exactly. Exactly. So there's that. Um,

47:04.040 --> 47:08.840
and, uh, I played a little more mass effect, legendary edition, which I know I, uh, popped

47:08.840 --> 47:14.920
off as the kids say a couple of weeks ago. Um, but since we had the end of May and the last,

47:14.920 --> 47:20.440
you know, week, last two weeks, uh, I had about 70 gigs left in my bandwidth for the month.

47:20.440 --> 47:24.440
So I was like, all right, let me grab this mass effect, a legendary patch. You know,

47:24.440 --> 47:28.360
I was behind on my patches. So I had like, I don't know, 11 or 12 gigs to download.

47:28.360 --> 47:34.120
So I downloaded that patch and then continued my adventures in mass effect one. Um, and, um, yeah,

47:34.120 --> 47:37.480
I was having a, I was having a fine time with it, trying to grind some of the achievements and

47:37.480 --> 47:43.560
things like that. And I, the mass effect one does play so much better. Like it's a great time to

47:44.120 --> 47:49.960
jump in and experience the trilogy. If you've never played before, I would still maybe give it

47:49.960 --> 47:54.600
another couple months just to make sure they're not going to do any more patches. Um, but I think

47:54.600 --> 48:02.120
this is a it's, it's getting there, I suppose. Um, so, uh, yeah. Um, what was I going to say

48:02.120 --> 48:07.080
with that? Uh, Oh yeah. Shane had texted me. Apparently there are still bugs. He sent me

48:07.080 --> 48:11.960
a video where he got his character stuck in the Citadel, uh, and was like bouncing around and

48:11.960 --> 48:16.920
stuff. So, uh, it's still got its issues, but I didn't find them for whatever it's worth. And I,

48:16.920 --> 48:21.640
I don't know if the average player will, but, uh, yeah. So I did, I did, I did play a little more

48:21.640 --> 48:26.520
mass effect legendary edition. Um, you know, since I had the bandwidth to download, um,

48:27.080 --> 48:31.080
uh, the patch, I don't know when I'll be able to start two and three since I cannot install from

48:31.080 --> 48:35.480
the disks. So we'll have to see how the bandwidth looks this month, but at least it's only a 30 day

48:35.480 --> 48:41.880
month. There's that. All right. Um, I guess that's that for my gaming week. So, um, I don't

48:41.880 --> 48:46.840
really have any other housekeeping or news of note, so I think we will get into, Oh, I guess

48:46.840 --> 48:51.720
I should say for the housekeeping segment, uh, we are collecting channel points over at, uh, our

48:51.720 --> 48:57.320
Twitch stream over at VOG network. Uh, and if we get enough points, which, uh, on the current

48:57.320 --> 49:03.400
trajectory, I think we will, uh, we are going to present a special stream, uh, for folks at VOG

49:03.400 --> 49:09.400
network. It's going to be orange lounge radio episode one with commentary from myself,

49:09.400 --> 49:15.080
dark Sakura and Loki. And that should be interesting because episode one, um, is probably

49:15.080 --> 49:19.960
not a great piece of media, but I think it's a great opportunity for us to really look at how

49:19.960 --> 49:26.040
far we've come in the last 19 years and really talk about, you know, some of the stuff behind

49:26.040 --> 49:30.120
the formation of the show that maybe we haven't gotten into on the show before. I think it'd be

49:30.120 --> 49:36.040
a fun time to, uh, jump back, uh, and take a look. So tell, tell some stories to the children of the

49:36.040 --> 49:45.880
olden days. Right guys. All right. Anyhow, horror of me in my twenties. Oh God. Yeah.

49:46.520 --> 49:51.080
Hearing myself in my twenties is not something I'm looking forward to. Um, and I, I already know

49:51.080 --> 49:55.000
we're going to say something that's going to be like, Oh God, I wish I hadn't said that, or I

49:55.000 --> 49:58.040
wouldn't have said that today. I know there's going to be something in there that's going to

49:58.040 --> 50:03.800
make me do that. But I think that's also part of, um, I think looking back, acknowledging that and

50:03.800 --> 50:10.760
going, wow, I've grown since then, um, is, is a good thing. I do. So, uh, we'll do that. So, all

50:10.760 --> 50:16.040
right. Uh, let's move on. Let's get into, uh, this week in gaming news. And I believe we start off

50:16.040 --> 50:23.480
with Loki. Yeah. So we've got an announcement of a brand new mini console. Um, this is kind of

50:23.560 --> 50:29.960
similar to the one that Sega put out a while back. That was the Sega Astro city cabinet.

50:29.960 --> 50:39.880
This one is a Taito egret too many, and it's full of different games, classic games, obviously.

50:39.880 --> 50:44.600
Um, they're going to have a 40 games in their total. They've only announced some of them so far,

50:45.160 --> 50:50.760
but of course, big names like space invaders, lunar rescue kicks, elevator action,

50:51.480 --> 50:58.440
bubble bobble, rainbow islands, extra New Zealand story. Um, they also have several different

50:59.080 --> 51:07.240
like controller setups that you can get as well. Um, which looked kind of cool and yeah,

51:07.240 --> 51:15.400
it's supposed to be priced at about 18,678 yen, which is about $170. And it's coming out next

51:15.400 --> 51:23.800
year. So March 2nd, 2022 in Japan, obviously. All right. I, yeah, I did see the different,

51:23.800 --> 51:28.520
like, I want to say they had different like setups for like the actual control panel.

51:28.520 --> 51:37.720
So they even have like, say a, um, Oh, they called it the paddle and trackball games. So I

51:37.720 --> 51:41.240
don't know if they actually have a paddle and stuff in there, but, um, arcinoids in there as

51:41.240 --> 51:47.160
well and arcinoid returns. Um, but yeah, pretty cool lineup. Yeah. And I love the, the monitor

51:47.160 --> 51:55.560
thing is pretty cool. So yeah. Um, I, uh, I don't know how many arcade replicas I can fit in my

51:55.560 --> 52:01.720
house, but that does sound nice. Uh, especially, uh, you know, there's stuff coming up later,

52:01.720 --> 52:06.520
but, uh, arcade went up, but I mean, we all know that's a thing. Uh, dark soccer has got

52:06.520 --> 52:11.000
pinball machines to deal with as well. It's almost like there's too many big collectibles

52:11.240 --> 52:20.280
All right. Let's talk about some virtual things. Yeah. Never enough is the correct,

52:20.280 --> 52:25.560
uh, answer, I suppose. All right. Let's talk about things that are virtual in the game creating

52:25.560 --> 52:31.320
space. Facebook has made another purchase this week. Um, which, you know, man, I'm not a huge

52:31.320 --> 52:35.960
fan of Facebook, but this one at least makes a little bit of sense to me. I think even if you

52:35.960 --> 52:40.680
were kind of like, I don't understand why Facebook bought Oculus, even though I think that actually

52:40.680 --> 52:44.760
does make a lot of sense, but we're not going to retread that old ground tonight. Uh, this,

52:44.760 --> 52:51.400
this is an interesting one. So they've bought a game making platform called U well unit two games

52:51.400 --> 52:57.640
is who they bought unit two games made something called Crayta. This is a collaborative game

52:57.640 --> 53:03.640
creating platform that was built on unreal engine four. It's actually in Google Stadia,

53:03.640 --> 53:08.760
uh, which I didn't realize at all. Maybe I didn't play around with Stadia enough. Uh, I doubt you've

53:08.760 --> 53:12.280
come across this. You're, you're kind of the Stadia fan in the house, dark soccer, but I doubt

53:12.280 --> 53:18.200
you've come across this yet. Oh, maybe you did. I don't know. I have it. Oh, have you, oh, have you

53:18.200 --> 53:22.520
played around with it at all? No, it was free. Oh, huh. Uh, I remember seeing some of like the

53:22.520 --> 53:26.600
previews and the trailers for it. So I thought it was interesting, but yeah, so it started as a

53:26.600 --> 53:31.880
Stadia, uh, exclusive, but now Facebook is going to be absorbing this team and now Facebook has a

53:31.880 --> 53:38.040
part of the technology. Uh, however, uh, in the FAQs that were posted about this acquisition,

53:38.040 --> 53:42.280
uh, this team is not going to stop working on Crayta. The game will still continue to be

53:42.280 --> 53:45.800
available. So don't think that, Oh, they're going to shut down the Stadia one and move it to

53:45.800 --> 53:49.720
Facebook or whatever it is. Although I imagine Facebook is going to be getting its own version

53:49.720 --> 53:55.960
of this, but Facebook has purchased the company to make game creation, more accessible and easy

53:55.960 --> 54:02.280
to use. And they're looking to integrate Crayta's creation tool set into Facebook gaming's cloud

54:02.280 --> 54:09.160
platform to instantly deliver new experiences via Facebook. Now, keep in mind in Crayta,

54:09.160 --> 54:13.880
you can make your own games, you know, it's, it's kind of limited coding, uh, whatever your comfort

54:13.880 --> 54:19.560
level is there. Uh, and then folks play the games and you can, they can actually earn money for,

54:19.560 --> 54:25.800
I'd say you can earn money when they play your games. Um, so that's kind of interesting. Uh,

54:25.800 --> 54:29.160
is that maybe there's going to be a whole little money-making thing there that Facebook wants to

54:29.160 --> 54:38.120
get in on. Um, I don't know. Any thoughts on that with Facebook getting into that? Uh, I kind of

54:38.120 --> 54:43.560
does. It really does. Yeah. I was thinking of something like that. Something that is,

54:45.080 --> 54:49.000
you know, it all comes down to money anyway, but I think that they're trying to get in on the

54:49.000 --> 54:55.320
younger market. Yes, that's for sure. Uh, going to our chat, uh, Legend of Zaku. Welcome back,

54:55.400 --> 55:00.280
by the way. And chat says, I can't see how this is a plus for Facebook other than to milk it to

55:00.280 --> 55:05.720
holy hell. Well, if they see money in it, that's how it's a plus for Facebook, but I could see how

55:05.720 --> 55:10.760
they might want to integrate it within Facebook where it's like, imagine if you're scrolling on

55:10.760 --> 55:16.520
your Facebook feed, right? And one thing you scroll across is, Hey, Oh, here's Bobby Blackwolf,

55:16.520 --> 55:22.120
uh, who just posted an update. Check out my newest version of flappy vog. And now it's right there

55:22.120 --> 55:25.640
on the feed. And you could check that out or you're scrolling past. There's Loki,

55:25.640 --> 55:31.640
here's pixel poops recreated in crater or YY or whoever makes it. And you can play it, uh, in your

55:31.640 --> 55:35.880
Facebook feed. I kind of think that might be a direction that Facebook's going in with that.

55:35.880 --> 55:40.280
Just like I always thought their Oculus acquisition was less about the games and more

55:40.280 --> 55:45.000
about, they want to be able to deliver like experiences in VR. They want to be able to have a

55:45.000 --> 55:50.680
Facebook feed in VR, so to speak. I think that's where they want really want to be a few years from

55:50.680 --> 55:56.440
now. Maybe not. It may be a hard thing to envision right now, but imagine if you, instead of reading

55:56.440 --> 56:02.280
somebody's update, got to experience somebody's update. I think that's where Facebook moves with

56:02.280 --> 56:07.240
Oculus. And I think that's where they want to experience my updates. And, and that's why I

56:07.240 --> 56:11.800
also kind of think like Facebook, it's a bit much, but I just feel like that's what they, that's

56:11.800 --> 56:16.920
where they're going with this is why not make your up? Why not make life updates experiences?

56:17.480 --> 56:20.760
And maybe you're not going to do it dark soccer, but I bet there's a lot of people,

56:21.400 --> 56:26.200
you know, especially as more and more younger folks are growing up with things like TikTok,

56:26.200 --> 56:31.560
Facebook, Instagram, uh, Twitter, all integrated into culture. I bet there's people that are going

56:31.560 --> 56:37.720
to be more than willing to share stuff, maybe too much so, uh, in this. The thing is, is that people

56:37.720 --> 56:43.800
are getting away from Facebook. I mean, this is my thought of like them trying to find a way to

56:43.800 --> 56:51.160
bring people back, but fair in the end, their usage in certain demographics is way decreased.

56:51.160 --> 56:55.080
Yeah. I guess I don't think I've posted anything on Facebook other than,

56:55.080 --> 57:01.800
oh, we have OLR and I've done like Instagram stuff. I rarely post to Facebook anymore myself.

57:01.800 --> 57:05.880
Um, because, uh, you know, when I have a quick thought, Twitter's usually easier, but also just

57:05.880 --> 57:10.120
like, and, and somebody was saying this on a podcast and I'm sorry, I don't remember who

57:10.120 --> 57:13.960
was saying it or what podcast, cause I was absorbing a lot of the last couple of weeks

57:13.960 --> 57:17.880
and a lot of driving that I was doing. But, um, somebody had said that, you know,

57:17.880 --> 57:23.320
Facebook was great when it was actually people's updates and pictures and things that were actually

57:23.320 --> 57:29.720
about people. But now you go on Facebook and all it is, it's headlines, it's clips, it's, um,

57:29.720 --> 57:37.800
uh, copy pasted links. It's, you know, uh, uh, things that are curated to get this emotional

57:37.800 --> 57:42.440
response from you to click an article. And it's not like the personality has been sucked out of

57:42.440 --> 57:49.480
Facebook. I think that was a great way of analyzing personal posts, you know, like Instagram is,

57:49.480 --> 57:55.080
you know, basically where my pictures come from. And, you know, I haven't logged into my,

57:55.080 --> 58:01.320
my sister's Facebook in two months for, for sisters of professional indulgence.

58:01.320 --> 58:05.240
But, um, but you know, I'm not saying like this live journal, you know, I'm not saying you

58:05.240 --> 58:08.840
specifically, or even the people in chat that are saying something similar specifically. I'm

58:08.840 --> 58:14.120
just saying Facebook as a whole is just hard to get through because it's nothing but emotional

58:14.120 --> 58:20.840
response crap. Yeah. And I'm, I think we're all, I want nothing to do with it. Yeah, I get you.

58:20.840 --> 58:24.200
Whatever happened to that pillow fort that was kind of like modern live journals,

58:24.200 --> 58:28.040
they ever come back, they got pulled offline for like a security thing. Did they ever come back?

58:28.920 --> 58:31.960
Remember you and I posted on there like twice and then they took it down.

58:32.600 --> 58:37.480
I have to look into that. All right. I have to look. I was eating eggs.

58:37.480 --> 58:41.560
No, you're fine. You're fine. Um, so I have to look into that. I am about to toss over the

58:41.560 --> 58:46.040
next story though. Just be warned. Uh, but I'm looking here. Okay, good. Looking in our chat, um,

58:46.600 --> 58:52.600
bonds, double six and chat says I post to Nami is back bitches every Saturday at 12.

58:52.600 --> 58:57.080
That's the bulk of my Facebook posts. That's fine. And that's a lot of what I see on Twitter,

58:57.080 --> 59:02.680
honestly, is that type of thing. So, uh, bonds double six also says I've been doing that for

59:02.680 --> 59:10.200
years. I have friends that DM me if I'm three minutes late. I love that. That's funny. All

59:10.200 --> 59:17.400
right. For the record, I just logged into pillow fort. Oh, so it works again. Looks like it's back.

59:17.400 --> 59:22.600
All right. I'll have to go make an update. That's fun. Follow me, you guys. All right.

59:23.400 --> 59:26.840
Let's get into our next story though. Uh, dark side, speaking of people moving, right?

59:27.560 --> 59:34.600
Well, this isn't just moving. This is complete leaving. Um, Yuji Naka, the man, the legend,

59:34.600 --> 59:46.520
um, he has, uh, confirmed that he's left, uh, squinnicks. Um, he, uh, he actually did resign

59:46.520 --> 59:52.200
from his position in April. Um, he says he can't talk about it, but he's considering retiring from

59:52.360 --> 59:57.640
video games altogether. Um, the quote, and I'll just read it directly translated. Of course,

59:58.520 --> 01:00:04.440
due to inquiries from the media and users on Twitters, I resigned from square annex at the end

01:00:04.440 --> 01:00:09.560
of April, 2021. I cannot tell you why right now, but I hope to be able to tell you when the time

01:00:09.560 --> 01:00:15.720
comes as for my future plans, I'm already 55 years old. So retirement is in the cards. Here is a photo

01:00:15.720 --> 01:00:21.480
that was taken for the Sega console Historia interview. So it's a cute photo.

01:00:24.360 --> 01:00:28.920
So I've seen this has to do with Bella and Wonderland not being so wonderful.

01:00:28.920 --> 01:00:34.040
It did not sell well in Japan. It, uh, apparently the sales, I don't know how it did here,

01:00:34.040 --> 01:00:38.920
but I don't think it did very well here either. And I think, I think it was that demo. I think

01:00:38.920 --> 01:00:45.320
that demo scared so many people off. Uh, I think it's gonna, I think this could be one for,

01:00:45.400 --> 01:00:51.640
you know, the, the history archives about, um, what to not do with your demo. But I think at the end,

01:00:51.640 --> 01:00:57.560
at the end, um, but Nino Cooney still sold enough to make a sequel, even though that demo was

01:00:57.560 --> 01:01:01.640
terrible, but I don't know if it's just maybe the state of social media now versus the state

01:01:01.640 --> 01:01:06.680
of social media when Nino Cooney's demo was out, which was a long time ago at this point. Um,

01:01:06.680 --> 01:01:12.040
but that really to, and I, to be fair, I don't think the game either really got a,

01:01:12.040 --> 01:01:16.280
turned a lot of heads. Some people are really into it. That game definitely has its defenders

01:01:16.280 --> 01:01:20.120
and I haven't played it. So I don't have an opinion either way, but I can say the way y'all

01:01:20.120 --> 01:01:26.280
reacted to it, uh, made me go and I can pass on this, but it's sad for somebody like Yuji Naka,

01:01:26.280 --> 01:01:34.840
who has such a legendary resume. Um, but at the same time, sometimes, sometimes great artists flop

01:01:34.840 --> 01:01:40.120
and it happens. It happens in music. I have a picture of Dan and Yuji Naka from the early

01:01:40.120 --> 01:01:45.080
2000s. Oh, that's awesome. From like E3 or something. Look at Mighty No. 9. I mean,

01:01:45.640 --> 01:01:51.720
that was something that like had the pedigree to be really great, but it just didn't end up

01:01:51.720 --> 01:01:57.480
working out. Yeah. And this, this happens sometimes in, in like music, like, uh, Kelly

01:01:57.480 --> 01:02:03.080
Clarkson's My December album compared to her others, not her greatest one. And there's,

01:02:03.080 --> 01:02:05.800
there's plenty of others too. I don't know why that one came to mind. I'm trying to think of

01:02:05.800 --> 01:02:11.000
musicians where it's like, they released a real stinker, but a lot of their albums are usually

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:16.280
pretty better well-received. Uh, and movies. I'm sure y'all know, I'm sure y'all know a director

01:02:16.280 --> 01:02:20.840
who makes great movies, but then they put out a real, a real turd once in a while. Like it

01:02:20.840 --> 01:02:29.160
happens, right? So, um, Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, uh, Saint Anger by Metallica is an example

01:02:29.160 --> 01:02:35.080
of what I was talking about. Um, so, uh, PixelPakas agrees. This is My December. Yep.

01:02:35.080 --> 01:02:39.640
Uh, and, uh, there are folks in chat are talking about if, uh, uh, the Battle of Wonderland,

01:02:39.640 --> 01:02:44.760
it flopped hard. Uh, Square has already put it on sale at least once, says Sacred Jade.

01:02:44.760 --> 01:02:50.760
Uh, Mike Deff says not even like two weeks after release and it's already $20 USD off.

01:02:50.760 --> 01:02:55.880
Yep. Uh, Questbuster in chat says Shroud of the Avatar by Richard Garriott. Oh,

01:02:55.880 --> 01:03:01.160
how about you want to talk Lord British? What about his, uh, MMO Tabula Rasa? That's there's,

01:03:01.160 --> 01:03:06.680
there you go. That was a stinker, um, for his resume too, even though obviously he's an all

01:03:06.680 --> 01:03:12.040
time great and so forth, but, uh, yeah. Um, so anyway, I'm not, you know, it's a bummer though,

01:03:12.040 --> 01:03:17.400
that it, all it took was like this one game and now Yuji Naka is like, eh, maybe I won't be doing

01:03:17.400 --> 01:03:23.640
anything else for Square Enix, but I'm sure Square Enix saw this as being like a franchise. And

01:03:23.720 --> 01:03:28.680
clearly that's not going to happen. Right. So, yeah, I still kind of want to play it.

01:03:29.560 --> 01:03:34.200
Yeah. Well, and the good news for what it's worth is that it'll probably be very cheap to do so. Um,

01:03:35.800 --> 01:03:41.000
it'll probably be a free game of the month on some services or a game pass thing or whatever

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:45.160
pretty well. Did it come out on Xbox? I can't even remember. Uh, it'll be, it'll be on all

01:03:45.160 --> 01:03:51.800
sorts of those services pretty soon. All right. Anyhow, let's move on. Um, let's,

01:03:51.800 --> 01:03:56.760
let's talk about things that went from bad to good. Yeah. I'm surprised to see that we're

01:03:56.760 --> 01:04:03.000
still getting more updates. So like, this is like completely, we just had an update not that long

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:10.200
ago, but now of course, a hello game saying hello, here's yet another update. Um, so they released

01:04:10.200 --> 01:04:15.560
prisms, which is a update for no man's sky that adds several different features of the game,

01:04:15.560 --> 01:04:21.080
including some additional, uh, graphic improvements, including fur, uh, light

01:04:21.080 --> 01:04:26.760
refraction in the rain, more details to the cave environments, reflective metal in space stations

01:04:26.760 --> 01:04:35.000
and more also flying, um, pet mounts that you can get. And yeah, I mean, it just looks pretty cool.

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:40.040
I'm just surprised to see, like, like I thought we were at a point where like, yeah, this is

01:04:40.040 --> 01:04:44.520
pretty good now. And now they're like, but you know what? It could be even better. Yeah. Right.

01:04:45.160 --> 01:04:49.960
Um, and you look, I'm the resident, no man's sky fan boy here, I think in the house. And I played

01:04:49.960 --> 01:04:55.560
this update a little bit. I'm kind of waiting on expedition three, you know, expedition two ended

01:04:55.560 --> 01:05:00.120
with the big surprise that you unlock the Normandy, but we're in a low right now. There is no active

01:05:00.120 --> 01:05:03.560
expedition. So you just have the base game right now. You can use all the rewards that you've done

01:05:03.560 --> 01:05:07.160
through expeditions and stuff, but, um, that that's it. Right. So I'm kind of waiting on

01:05:07.160 --> 01:05:12.760
expedition three to really jump back in, but I did look a little bit, um, at some of the changes.

01:05:12.840 --> 01:05:18.200
Like I played for maybe like 30 minutes and yeah, they, they really enhance the space station with

01:05:18.200 --> 01:05:21.800
like a better background. It looks really cool. And, uh, you know, when you're like,

01:05:22.600 --> 01:05:28.040
walking on the floor and stuff, it's really, um, yeah, it does like, it's, you can notice some of

01:05:28.040 --> 01:05:32.280
the visual updates. It looks really good, but the crazy part is, and Loki, you're kind of referring

01:05:32.280 --> 01:05:38.120
to this, is that they just did a graphical update to this game in November. They, they just,

01:05:38.120 --> 01:05:43.480
cause they did the big update to make it next gen, uh, from, or, you know, from PS4 type graphics

01:05:43.480 --> 01:05:48.920
to PS5 type graphics. That was just in November. And now we're getting another big graphical

01:05:48.920 --> 01:05:53.560
update. That's crazy. I really need to go back and play this game. I have it on PC,

01:05:53.560 --> 01:05:58.520
never played it on PC, but like, I bet it was just like incredible now. Although the longer I wait,

01:05:58.520 --> 01:06:01.880
the better it's going to look. So that's, I'll just wait a little bit longer, I guess.

01:06:02.520 --> 01:06:08.360
Yeah. Uh, SSU100Matt in chat says, no man's sky is one of those great gaming comeback stories,

01:06:08.360 --> 01:06:13.160
perhaps the greatest. And Miltonias Games in chat follows that up saying no man's sky and Final

01:06:13.160 --> 01:06:17.320
Fantasy 14 are right up there for biggest turnaround. And yeah, I'd agree with that.

01:06:17.320 --> 01:06:21.320
I mean, the only other thing I can think of that's nearly as big is Final Fantasy 14. And

01:06:21.320 --> 01:06:29.240
I think what makes 14's trajectory unique is that 14 is still growing. It's still getting more and

01:06:29.240 --> 01:06:32.680
more fans. And there was a very, you know, just a tangent a little bit, but you guys all know,

01:06:32.680 --> 01:06:36.120
I follow Final Fantasy 14 stuff. There was a really interesting interview that just came

01:06:36.120 --> 01:06:42.120
out with Yoshi P where he kind of talked about, they intentionally did not advertise during the

01:06:42.120 --> 01:06:47.000
pandemic to make it look like they were capitalizing on the stay at home situation

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:52.360
and all that, which I thought was really, um, classy. Um, but at the same time, he didn't deny

01:06:53.400 --> 01:06:58.840
that the game has been there for people in this whole, you know, COVID and quarantine time and

01:06:58.840 --> 01:07:03.080
the pandemic and all that. So he sort of acknowledged, yes, it's helped the game,

01:07:03.080 --> 01:07:10.680
but we've tried not to lean into that too much. Um, but you know, uh, not every video game grew

01:07:10.680 --> 01:07:15.240
during the pandemic. Sure. Things like Animal Crossing did as well, but you know, for every

01:07:15.240 --> 01:07:19.480
huge, you know, game that took off during the pandemic, there were still some stinkers.

01:07:19.480 --> 01:07:23.080
We could talk about some games that didn't make that same turnaround. Hello, Anthem.

01:07:23.800 --> 01:07:29.480
Oops. It was supposed to, but it didn't. Oops. Um, I would say the only other game that really

01:07:29.480 --> 01:07:33.640
comes close that I can think of off the top of my head is Diablo 3, but I would, I mean,

01:07:35.080 --> 01:07:39.560
and don't, I'm not trying to sell short Diablo 3's turnaround, which was huge. And it was probably

01:07:39.560 --> 01:07:44.360
the first out of all these games. But, uh, I really think Final Fantasy 14 story and now No

01:07:44.360 --> 01:07:49.960
Man's Sky story again is one for the history books, uh, as far as I'm concerned, which is

01:07:49.960 --> 01:07:56.120
pretty cool. Huh? Uh, Mike Deaf says Super Mario Party with its online update. I don't think Super

01:07:56.120 --> 01:08:01.720
Mario Party was quite as, um, raked over the coals as the other games when they first came out.

01:08:02.280 --> 01:08:08.200
So, um, Miltonias Games pointing out Elder Scrolls Online also did good. That's true.

01:08:08.200 --> 01:08:12.280
Elder Scrolls Online, I think also has their next big update, like what? June 15th. It's really

01:08:12.280 --> 01:08:17.800
soon. That's another one I need to check out because I tried the beta back when it was like

01:08:17.800 --> 01:08:23.960
first available and I just could not get into it. Like it just wasn't like, I like Elder Scrolls

01:08:23.960 --> 01:08:30.760
and I can play it online. Sweet. But then, then I played them like, this isn't like Skyrim at all.

01:08:30.760 --> 01:08:36.440
And then, so I just kind of like fell out of it, but like, maybe that I think it's still a game

01:08:36.440 --> 01:08:43.480
pass. So maybe it is. It is. And, um, you know, again, not to, not to like belittle this comment,

01:08:43.480 --> 01:08:47.000
you know, about Elder Scrolls Online, but one thing I do want to point out why it's not usually

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:51.320
said in the same breath. Look at the reviews with, when Elder Scrolls Online first came out

01:08:51.320 --> 01:08:56.680
and when Final Fantasy 14 1.0 first came out. I don't think Elder Scrolls Online got rave reviews,

01:08:57.240 --> 01:09:04.280
but it did not get completely shit on like Final Fantasy 14 1.0 did and deservedly so. And you guys

01:09:04.280 --> 01:09:11.240
all know I'm a huge Final Fantasy 14 fan boy. 1.0 is the worst MMO I've ever played. It is fucking

01:09:11.240 --> 01:09:16.280
terrible. Um, and it, that game went through a complete transformation. And so I think that's

01:09:16.280 --> 01:09:20.520
why you don't often hear it in the same, you don't hear like Elder Scrolls Online in the same

01:09:20.520 --> 01:09:26.120
breath, not to belittle or, uh, you know, uh, minimize the achievements that that game has

01:09:26.120 --> 01:09:31.960
had over the years. But it went from, it's all right to, oh, neat. It's still going after all

01:09:31.960 --> 01:09:39.000
these years. Whereas Final Fantasy 1.0 was like, this is fucking garbage, mom, to it's incredible.

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:43.560
And, you know, probably the biggest MMO out there right now. Like, I do think we're at a point

01:09:43.560 --> 01:09:49.320
where Final Fantasy 14 is said more than WoW is. I think that's the reality, you know? So,

01:09:49.320 --> 01:09:52.360
but I thought, again, there was a really cool interview with Yoshi P. I think it was the same

01:09:52.360 --> 01:09:57.960
interview actually, where he kind of acknowledged Final Fantasy 14 would not have been reborn in

01:09:57.960 --> 01:10:03.080
this way if it wasn't for WoW. And he says, I'm a Blizzard fan boy. I've been able to go to

01:10:03.080 --> 01:10:07.640
Blizzard's campus like three times and I've had a great time every time. And I love talking to their

01:10:07.640 --> 01:10:14.360
team and, and I love hearing how many people at Blizzard play the game. And, um, yeah. So

01:10:14.360 --> 01:10:19.640
I think it's, I think it's great that there is that love between the two. Um, and maybe Blizzard

01:10:19.640 --> 01:10:23.400
maybe is thinking maybe it's time for successor to World of Warcraft. I don't know. I don't know.

01:10:23.400 --> 01:10:28.280
I'm, I'm probably getting ahead of myself. Yeah. And like, it might just be, I think,

01:10:28.840 --> 01:10:35.560
and there's not, I think WoW has just lived its life, you know? And sure you come at me with the

01:10:35.560 --> 01:10:41.240
EverQuest has 29 expansions or whatever. Sure. Fine. Yes. Yes. Like even, even with that though,

01:10:41.240 --> 01:10:46.200
like eventually it has to end. I mean, it's just going forever. Cause it's just, it looks,

01:10:46.200 --> 01:10:52.680
it starts to get dated. I mean like it, they want to put something out more modern to draw people

01:10:52.680 --> 01:10:57.640
in. Let me rephrase. I think this says it better. World of Warcraft has peaked.

01:10:58.680 --> 01:11:01.960
Final Fantasy 14 doesn't seem like it's peaked yet.

01:11:01.960 --> 01:11:09.800
So, and this next expansion may make it even bigger. So I think that's the key difference.

01:11:09.800 --> 01:11:16.120
So anyway, uh, all right. Uh, let's move on. I'm talking, I went from No Man's Sky to MMO chat,

01:11:16.120 --> 01:11:20.280
but, uh, you know, these are, these are genres I'm passionate about. What can I say? Let's say,

01:11:20.280 --> 01:11:25.080
Hey, a lot of people have passion for Nintendo as well. And what if you could visit an official

01:11:25.080 --> 01:11:29.240
Nintendo museum? That sounds pretty rad, right? In fact, actually I think a lot of the reason

01:11:29.240 --> 01:11:33.960
people love to go to the New York city store is that they have like, it's very, very, but it

01:11:33.960 --> 01:11:39.000
feels like a Nintendo shrine of sorts. Yes. With lots and lots of merchandise to sell you,

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:42.840
but they have like those tiny little exhibits upstairs. Like, Oh, here's the game boy that

01:11:42.840 --> 01:11:47.240
got destroyed in desert storm. Right. They have those things at the New York city store. Um,

01:11:47.240 --> 01:11:51.400
I think a lot of people would love to see a actual large Nintendo museum and guess what?

01:11:51.400 --> 01:11:56.680
One is coming. Uh, in about three years, you're going to get to visit a museum in Japan. So you

01:11:56.680 --> 01:12:01.720
got to go there, but celebrating everything about Nintendo, they are going to be repurposing

01:12:01.720 --> 01:12:07.720
an old factory into a gallery that will showcase consoles and other products that Nintendo has

01:12:07.720 --> 01:12:12.200
launched throughout Nintendo's history. Uh, they're hoping to make it a tourist attraction.

01:12:12.200 --> 01:12:18.200
So it's going to be the Uji Ogura plant, uh, and the surrounding land will be taking, uh,

01:12:18.200 --> 01:12:22.520
taking that on. Uh, and I think this has to do they're, they're choosing this because the

01:12:22.520 --> 01:12:29.080
Oguro station is also being, uh, re redeveloped in Japan. Um, so that's pretty cool. This is by

01:12:29.080 --> 01:12:34.280
the way, right outside Kyoto. Um, and, uh, this is hopefully a way to bring back more tourists.

01:12:34.280 --> 01:12:38.600
So that's pretty rad. Uh, this plant, by the way, used to manufacture playing cards and the

01:12:38.600 --> 01:12:44.280
Hanafuda cards. Uh, and it was also a customer service site for product repairs. And so now,

01:12:44.280 --> 01:12:49.160
this that's all moved to a newer factory. Uh, or are you showing some of those cards on stream

01:12:49.160 --> 01:12:54.520
right now? Dark Sakura looks like, yeah, I have the Mario Hanahuda cards. You can order

01:12:55.240 --> 01:13:00.840
them, um, actually on Nintendo's website. So the Nintendo gallery, uh, which is the early name for

01:13:00.840 --> 01:13:06.520
this project, no word on when it will open yet, but they're targeting March, 2024. So that's

01:13:06.520 --> 01:13:13.960
pretty exciting. Lots of stuff to, uh, visit in Japan in 2024. Um, the legend is Zaku and chat

01:13:13.960 --> 01:13:18.840
says Japan done fucked up COVID after initially doing very well against it last year. I think

01:13:18.840 --> 01:13:24.680
it's probably one of those things where it just, the surge didn't hit until later and it's, it's

01:13:24.680 --> 01:13:29.960
unfortunate. It's probably going to ruin the Olympics. Yeah, it's, it is. You're, you're seeing

01:13:29.960 --> 01:13:35.720
other countries now kind of going through it. Like obviously what, what happened in India is just

01:13:37.160 --> 01:13:42.840
horrific. Words can't even describe it. India though did have a mass mismanagement. Um,

01:13:43.080 --> 01:13:50.680
yeah, Japan actually being a society that already masks was really good in the beginning for holding

01:13:50.680 --> 01:13:57.080
out. Um, it's just the way that they were dealing with vaccinations. I'm really glad we're starting

01:13:57.080 --> 01:14:01.160
to pass off some of our surplus vaccinations to other parts of the world. I think that's a great

01:14:01.160 --> 01:14:07.080
thing. It makes me, makes me happy to be an American when sometimes, especially in the last

01:14:07.080 --> 01:14:11.640
four years, there were not, I wasn't always feeling that way when I got out of bed. So

01:14:11.640 --> 01:14:16.920
that's great. All right. Um, let's move on. What do we have next? Dark Sagra.

01:14:17.960 --> 01:14:27.480
Well, um, there is more law site law, lawsuit news. Um, Nintendo filed a lawsuit against a

01:14:27.480 --> 01:14:34.760
ROM website called ROM universe and that was in 2019. Um, and it has since been concluded,

01:14:34.760 --> 01:14:40.360
the judge has ruled in Nintendo's favor saying that ROM universe, and I'm going to quote,

01:14:40.360 --> 01:14:47.480
is a straightforward video game piracy case, the, the, the situation. Um, and that the site was

01:14:47.480 --> 01:14:52.200
quote populated the website with pirated copies of thousands of different Nintendo games and

01:14:52.200 --> 01:14:57.720
distributed hundreds of thousands of copies of those pirated games because, uh, they also

01:14:58.440 --> 01:15:06.200
sold paid premium accounts. So, um, so basically they were making money off of pirated material

01:15:06.200 --> 01:15:15.320
instead of it just being like a free to download kind of thing. Um, so, uh, basically, um,

01:15:15.320 --> 01:15:21.000
they, Nintendo was seeking over 15 million in copyright and trademark infringement damages.

01:15:21.720 --> 01:15:29.320
Um, the company is going to be paying less than that. They ruled, uh, 35,000, uh, in statutory

01:15:29.320 --> 01:15:37.960
damages for the 49 copyrights, uh, is enough. So they'll be paying 1.7 million. Um, Nintendo was

01:15:37.960 --> 01:15:45.640
looking for 90,000 to per work. So this is better for the company, but, um, the total that they're

01:15:45.640 --> 01:15:52.680
going to be receiving is 2,115,000. So don't sell ROMs.

01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:56.200
Don't sell them, give them for free.

01:15:57.160 --> 01:16:01.000
Which I guess this site, it kind of did that, but they had the subscription thing, right?

01:16:03.240 --> 01:16:07.720
Uh, yeah, that was the thing. And they, they sold premium subscriptions.

01:16:07.720 --> 01:16:13.880
Yeah. Yeah. Don't, don't make money off Nintendo. They have a way of finding you and,

01:16:13.880 --> 01:16:21.000
and, uh, destroying you. Their, their fingers are up everyone's ass and not in a good way.

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:25.640
And I was going to say, I was going to say, not everybody's going to complain about that.

01:16:25.640 --> 01:16:27.160
Anyway, Loki quick change the subject.

01:16:28.360 --> 01:16:34.920
All right. Well, I mean, I'd like to change the subject, but, um, topic of ass we're

01:16:34.920 --> 01:16:43.560
talking about the Atari VCS console coming out. Um, eh, yeah, it's finally out, I guess,

01:16:43.560 --> 01:16:49.560
but I mean, I'm, I don't know. Um, it's coming out on the 15th of June. It's going to be

01:16:49.560 --> 01:16:54.520
starting at $300, but apparently they have a version with a classic, you know,

01:16:54.520 --> 01:17:01.160
Atari 26 under controller and you know, your modern controller for $400, um, be available

01:17:01.160 --> 01:17:10.440
in retail soon. Is it any good? I don't know. It's like a PC, I guess, but I'm not all that

01:17:10.440 --> 01:17:15.080
excited about it to be honest. I mean, the console is a cool shape, but it's just, it's basically

01:17:15.080 --> 01:17:21.080
just a rising chip in there. So if I wanted one of those, I just build my own PC.

01:17:22.680 --> 01:17:28.680
Any, uh, Atari VCS fans in the house and chat anybody, uh, pre-ordering their Atari VCS.

01:17:28.680 --> 01:17:33.080
No, like, I, I know I'm sounding very, but I literally want to know, like,

01:17:33.080 --> 01:17:34.840
what is motivating people to get this system?

01:17:38.120 --> 01:17:42.840
Yeah. I mean, it's, I don't know. It's just not something I'm looking for. I like the case. I

01:17:42.840 --> 01:17:46.440
like the design of it. It would have been cool if it was like a dedicated console that

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:51.960
they had more, you know, into it, but like, it sounded like it was just like a PC running

01:17:51.960 --> 01:17:55.080
something that I think that's already available right now. They have like some Atari software

01:17:55.080 --> 01:18:00.120
that's already available. You can play some of these classic games on, but I don't know.

01:18:00.120 --> 01:18:06.120
It's just not as cool as it originally sounded. When's the Atari hotel coming? Let's talk about

01:18:06.120 --> 01:18:11.560
something that's that's positive. Is it? I don't know. I figured the pandemic,

01:18:11.560 --> 01:18:16.120
well, I figured the pandemic fucked it all up, but I'm, I'm still all about staying at the

01:18:16.120 --> 01:18:21.800
Atari hotel. I mean, that does look pretty cool. And I mean, maybe I'll get to play a VCS at the

01:18:21.800 --> 01:18:27.240
Atari hotel, the hotel, you know, they'll have it in each room. Uh, the hotel kind of looks more

01:18:27.240 --> 01:18:34.280
like Tron than it does Atari hotel. I failed to see the problem. I don't, I'm not seeing that's

01:18:34.280 --> 01:18:39.320
a bad thing. I'm saying that maybe they should lean that direction a little bit more than the

01:18:39.320 --> 01:18:45.720
Atari thing. Um, yeah, it's coming in 2022 right now. So not yet, but yeah, I mean,

01:18:45.720 --> 01:18:50.200
I figured the pandemic slowed those plans down, but yeah, it's way better than what the Hooters

01:18:50.200 --> 01:18:55.960
hotel they have, or I know they have a hotel. It's all woodgrain and it's something trashy like that

01:18:55.960 --> 01:19:03.640
pass. Yeah. All right. Moving on. Oh, pixel pockets clarifies the Hooters hotel is gone.

01:19:04.600 --> 01:19:10.440
Oh, was it in Florida? This sounds like a Florida thing. No, no, no. It was in Vegas. Um, it's been

01:19:10.440 --> 01:19:15.880
a long time since I've been to Vegas. It was on a business trip and I saw that when we were going to,

01:19:15.880 --> 01:19:23.560
um, Oh gosh, what was it? Uh, to, to shoe company. Um, I don't remember, but they were going to,

01:19:23.560 --> 01:19:29.400
they were going to buy games. Um, I remember this being a thing now. Yes. Zappos when we were going

01:19:29.400 --> 01:19:36.920
to Zappos, uh, we drove past it and I was like, that looks trashy. I wonder what, I wonder what

01:19:36.920 --> 01:19:40.840
turnover the casinos has happened in Vegas during the pandemic. Cause I know Hard Rock's gone.

01:19:40.840 --> 01:19:47.240
It's now, it's now the Virgin hotel or something like that Richard Branson's, uh, Virgin. Um, so

01:19:47.240 --> 01:19:51.080
I'm curious how that all probably looks at this point, but, uh, I wonder what other casino

01:19:51.080 --> 01:19:55.800
turnovers have happened. I wonder if there will be an Atari, uh, casino in Vegas at some point,

01:19:55.800 --> 01:20:00.200
who knows? Uh, Questbuster says there's a new mega hotel opening up next to the Wynn.

01:20:00.200 --> 01:20:06.280
Where did they have room next to the Wynn? I guess I'm on top of each other. No,

01:20:06.280 --> 01:20:12.200
that where the Stardust used to be, I think was, was, uh, still open. Maybe I, my memory's a little

01:20:12.200 --> 01:20:17.240
fuzzy, but anyway. All right. Uh, let's move on this. Speaking of things from the past,

01:20:17.240 --> 01:20:23.400
I think this is very interesting. Uh, we have Ken and Roberta Williams back in the news. Um,

01:20:23.400 --> 01:20:27.720
you thought they were retired and, and quite frankly, so did they probably, but they got

01:20:27.720 --> 01:20:32.040
bored. I have a feeling and, you know, Bobby talked a little bit about this on his show too,

01:20:32.040 --> 01:20:36.040
but it is, it's, it's a thought I certainly had as well as that, you know what? Um,

01:20:36.040 --> 01:20:42.200
they were probably ready to sail around the world, do the, you know, months long cruise,

01:20:42.200 --> 01:20:48.200
go travel to all these different places and then up. Can't do that right now. Right. Bad idea.

01:20:48.200 --> 01:20:53.240
So maybe we'll just get right back into making a video game or at least, you know, I don't

01:20:53.720 --> 01:20:57.240
especially hearing about this project. I don't think they're like really getting in there the

01:20:57.240 --> 01:21:02.760
way they used to with the classic Sierra online games, but even to see them contributing to a

01:21:02.760 --> 01:21:07.000
newer game is, you know, it's a neat thought and a neat idea. It's just neat that we haven't seen

01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:12.040
the last of Ken and Roberta Williams. So what the hell is going on? Let's, uh, talk about it.

01:21:12.040 --> 01:21:17.960
They are working on a new game, uh, with a 3d artist, Marcus Maximus Mara. We don't know the,

01:21:17.960 --> 01:21:22.440
uh, project title beyond something called the secret. We don't know if that's like actually

01:21:22.440 --> 01:21:27.000
the name of the game. Uh, I would, I would hope this would not be confused with that book

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:32.920
that was on every talk show, uh, in what the two thousands. Right. So anyway, uh, this is a game

01:21:32.920 --> 01:21:39.640
called the secret for now. Um, or it's just, you know, a secret. Um, there is a website that you

01:21:39.640 --> 01:21:45.880
can visit. Uh, it's at kensgame.com. If you want to see more about it. Um, not a lot of details on

01:21:45.880 --> 01:21:49.640
the game yet, but it talks about what's going on behind the scenes. What is it going to be?

01:21:49.640 --> 01:21:54.680
A Sierra flavored or a Sierra inspired a Sierra, you know, a hint of Sierra game,

01:21:54.680 --> 01:22:01.080
uh, single player game. Think things like King's quest. Larry, it's going to be an adventure game.

01:22:01.080 --> 01:22:06.760
Modern audiences will be in mind though. And you know, they, they did a King's quest reboot. They

01:22:06.760 --> 01:22:12.280
not Ken and Roberta, but they being another company did a King's quest reboot probably

01:22:12.280 --> 01:22:17.560
about five years ago at this point. And it wasn't bad at all. I enjoyed it. I didn't play the whole

01:22:17.560 --> 01:22:21.960
thing, but I played like the first episode, maybe a little bit of the second and I enjoyed it. Um,

01:22:21.960 --> 01:22:27.640
so I think, you know, if it's something along those lines, Hey, I'm happy anyway. Um, especially,

01:22:27.640 --> 01:22:33.000
you know, I would love to see Ken and Roberta Williams take on the walking SIM genre. I know

01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:38.040
that that's sometimes used as a negative. I see walking SIM as a positive. There are so many good

01:22:38.040 --> 01:22:44.040
games such as, you know, everybody's gone to the rapture, dear Esther, um, uh, what remains of

01:22:44.040 --> 01:22:48.440
Edith Finch, you know, so many great games. Uh, I would love to see their take on that. I don't

01:22:48.440 --> 01:22:52.920
know if that's going to be this cause it's going to be a little more Sierra inspired, but, uh,

01:22:52.920 --> 01:22:57.800
yeah, who knows, who knows where this could actually end up going. Um, they've been developing

01:22:57.800 --> 01:23:02.680
this game over the past six months. They do. They are warning you on the game's website that

01:23:02.680 --> 01:23:07.160
Roberta's involvement has been kind of minimal, but she's supposed to be getting more involved

01:23:07.160 --> 01:23:13.080
as they get closer to release. So I don't really know what that actually means. It sounds like

01:23:13.080 --> 01:23:17.640
maybe she's not doing the bulk of the writing, but maybe she's contributing ideas, plot twists,

01:23:17.640 --> 01:23:22.760
things like that. I don't know. Um, we'll see as this develops, their goal is to release the game

01:23:22.760 --> 01:23:27.320
in November, but they're still working with placeholder graphics. And so I have a feeling

01:23:27.320 --> 01:23:30.200
this is not going to be, and most people have a feeling this isn't actually going to happen

01:23:30.200 --> 01:23:36.120
this year. Um, but maybe demos and screenshots at a later date. Um, supposedly another contributor

01:23:36.120 --> 01:23:42.120
on this project as well. They haven't named yet. Um, so I don't know, again, don't think that like

01:23:42.200 --> 01:23:46.520
they're building a game from the ground up, like they did in the eighties and nineties,

01:23:46.520 --> 01:23:50.520
because video games aren't made today. Like they were made in the eighties and nineties, right?

01:23:50.520 --> 01:23:55.160
It wasn't uncommon for one person to make a game in the eighties and nineties. Now it takes a team

01:23:55.160 --> 01:23:58.680
of people. And I know what you're thinking. Yeah, there are plenty of ways for one per,

01:23:58.680 --> 01:24:02.600
what about Axiom Verge? What about Pixel Poops? And there's plenty of games that one person can

01:24:02.600 --> 01:24:07.480
make, but I think to fit their vision and what they want to do, they're going to need more than

01:24:07.480 --> 01:24:11.560
just them to do it. So I think they're really kind of just contributing, you know, and, uh,

01:24:11.560 --> 01:24:16.200
just not really leaving gaming behind, especially in the face of a pandemic and what's going on

01:24:16.200 --> 01:24:20.680
with that. So, um, but I'll still play it. That's for sure. I'll check it out.

01:24:22.520 --> 01:24:30.280
I think they're great. Um, looking in chat over at twitch.tv slash a vog network, uh,

01:24:30.280 --> 01:24:34.200
Dr. Sia says, I'm tempted to start some of the older games because I got a hold of some of them

01:24:34.200 --> 01:24:38.680
for free. Like the space and police quest games missed them back in the eighties and nineties

01:24:38.680 --> 01:24:44.120
didn't get a PC till way past all of that. Just keep in mind, a lot of your modern conveniences

01:24:44.120 --> 01:24:48.680
and adventure games, aren't going to necessarily be present, especially in the early, early Kings

01:24:48.680 --> 01:24:53.640
quest games. It didn't start to get a little more graphical to like Kings quest for, um, was when

01:24:53.640 --> 01:24:58.760
the interface really changed. So just, just keep that in mind. Um, and you can skip the last Kings

01:24:58.760 --> 01:25:04.840
quest game, just, you know, all right. Yeah. Quest buster and chat says on Rob's note,

01:25:04.840 --> 01:25:10.680
early adventure games love to kill the player, but that was kind of the fun. I mean, I know people

01:25:10.680 --> 01:25:15.480
hate dying in games and having to start over, but it was kind of fun to see all the creative shit

01:25:15.480 --> 01:25:19.560
that they'd kill your character with in those games. And it wasn't graphic or anything, you

01:25:19.560 --> 01:25:24.600
know, it was a fantasy. It was just, you know, a lot of it was implied. So something to think

01:25:24.600 --> 01:25:30.760
about there. All right. Um, let's move on. So this is going to be a fun surprise for people,

01:25:30.760 --> 01:25:35.240
I think, because we have a fresh coat of paint on a very familiar segment. So let's get into it.

01:25:45.960 --> 01:25:51.640
And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time or I'll dive into the vault and pull out

01:25:51.640 --> 01:25:56.360
a classic and tell you about it. It's time for the classic game of the week.

01:26:03.320 --> 01:26:05.560
All right. And what is the classic game of the week?

01:26:10.040 --> 01:26:10.840
Jamie, you're muted.

01:26:14.920 --> 01:26:18.840
Then no one heard me say, Oh, fuck. Oh, wait, you did. Um, no, I didn't hear it either. You're

01:26:18.840 --> 01:26:23.800
muted on discord. That's right. The classic game is portal two. Um, yes, it is that old.

01:26:25.320 --> 01:26:35.640
You're welcome. So, um, at any rate, uh, portal two came out in 2011 in, uh, I want to say

01:26:37.160 --> 01:26:44.760
April. So yes, it is, uh, 10. It is, uh, it's 10 years old.

01:26:45.240 --> 01:26:54.680
Yep. You, you all should feel oldish. Um, so it was released, uh, by valve for windows,

01:26:54.680 --> 01:27:04.520
Mac OS 10, Linux, uh, PlayStation three and X-Box three 60. Um, the digital version was, uh,

01:27:04.520 --> 01:27:12.760
distributed online by valves steam service and the other retail, uh, additions were by electronic

01:27:13.640 --> 01:27:22.520
arts. So basically it is a, uh, an update of the original portal with a lot more silliness.

01:27:23.240 --> 01:27:28.440
Um, you, the one portal of one color, you come out through the portal of another color

01:27:29.240 --> 01:27:35.960
and, uh, however, and by the way, you're still are, are, uh, controlling Chell, who is, uh,

01:27:36.600 --> 01:27:44.120
the test subject. And she has been asleep for some time and was woken up by a robot or a, uh,

01:27:44.120 --> 01:27:52.520
I guess he's a core really, um, named Wheatley who is voiced by Steven merchant. Um, and so, uh,

01:27:53.240 --> 01:28:00.520
you go through the game and you start to discover other things, uh, other types of puzzles that were

01:28:00.520 --> 01:28:05.640
being created and you, I mean, it's, it's 10 years. I'll go ahead and spoil it. Glados is

01:28:05.640 --> 01:28:11.880
a potato. So you go around and you listen to old recordings of cave Johnson, which are absolutely

01:28:11.880 --> 01:28:18.680
hilarious and brilliant. Um, and of course we have Jonathan Golden still doing, uh, the end

01:28:18.680 --> 01:28:28.920
song for the game. Um, the other thing about this one too, is, uh, it had a bunch of AR games, uh,

01:28:29.880 --> 01:28:38.840
that promoted it, including one called, uh, potato stack where, sorry, potato sack where, um,

01:28:41.080 --> 01:28:48.360
you had to solve puzzles, uh, that showed up in, uh, in these different 13 updates. So, um,

01:28:49.880 --> 01:28:56.200
but going back to this portal to also, uh, had other things going on for it. So we're

01:28:56.200 --> 01:29:02.360
going to start back off with, you know, the essence of portal speedy thing goes in speedy

01:29:02.360 --> 01:29:12.280
thing goes out. It's physics. Um, so, uh, Oh, and yes, uh, uh, cave Johnson was, uh,

01:29:12.280 --> 01:29:20.440
voiced by J K Simmons who, uh, we might also know as J Jonah Jamison from our, uh, McGuire era

01:29:20.440 --> 01:29:26.520
Spider-Man movies. I believe so. Um, modern Spider-Man, the modern ones. Okay. Yeah. I

01:29:26.520 --> 01:29:30.760
thought it was a other era because this goes to show, I haven't seen a single one of the new ones.

01:29:30.760 --> 01:29:39.240
Um, so anyway, um, you have, uh, many different elements in this one apart from just, you know,

01:29:39.240 --> 01:29:49.080
the, uh, the, the weighted storage cubes and the portal guns and, um, the, uh, you know,

01:29:49.080 --> 01:29:56.520
the portals themselves, what you have are thermal discouragement beams, which are lasers,

01:29:57.240 --> 01:30:03.560
um, excursion funnels, which are tractor beams and hard light bridges that you can all direct

01:30:03.560 --> 01:30:11.800
through your portals. Aerial faith plates exist as well, which can launch you or objects into

01:30:11.800 --> 01:30:16.520
portals. Basically you just throw them on there. You do still have the turrets and they are still

01:30:16.520 --> 01:30:24.120
adorable. Um, as far as those redesigned weighted storage cubes, you now have redirection cubes

01:30:24.120 --> 01:30:30.120
that are prismatic and let you redirect the thermal discouragement beams. Um, you have

01:30:30.120 --> 01:30:41.160
spherical edgeless safety cubes, um, which are basically round storage cubes, um, and a poor,

01:30:41.240 --> 01:30:51.000
poor cube turret hybrid that Wheatley made and prominently fucked up on. Um, you also do have

01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:59.320
a return of the weighted companion cube. Um, you also have, um, pneumatic diversity vents,

01:31:00.440 --> 01:31:08.120
um, that have, uh, transport power, basically suction or transport. Um, those were actually

01:31:08.120 --> 01:31:16.760
in the demo, but were not included in the final game. Um, as far as other things that you get,

01:31:16.760 --> 01:31:25.640
um, again, this is something that was, uh, inspired by, uh, uh, by, uh, other games and tech

01:31:25.640 --> 01:31:31.320
demos. I'll have to get into that in a second, but you get the various kinds of gels. So you have an

01:31:31.320 --> 01:31:37.800
orange propulsion gel that will let you slide across surfaces quickly. You have repulsion gel

01:31:37.800 --> 01:31:46.360
that makes you bounce and white conversion gel that allows a surface to accept portals because,

01:31:46.360 --> 01:31:57.720
um, ground up, uh, moon rocks are poison and now he's deathly ill. Um, you have, uh, you also have

01:31:57.720 --> 01:32:05.160
the various funnels that you can use to make it go across in the air or go, um, you know,

01:32:05.160 --> 01:32:13.000
through the ground, um, like pull one, one direction versus the other. Uh, and then we also

01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:26.120
have the addition of multiplayer. So, um, so you can in single player, you can play Chell, um, who

01:32:26.120 --> 01:32:33.320
is the main protagonist. Um, there was also a rumor that there was supposed to be like a sister

01:32:33.400 --> 01:32:40.360
character for her who was supposed to be blonde. Um, that did not happen. Um,

01:32:42.040 --> 01:32:51.320
so this takes us then to cooperative mode. So with cooperative mode, you can play as one of two

01:32:51.320 --> 01:32:58.840
robots. Um, and see, this is where the, the Chell clone was supposed to come from. Um, so you have,

01:32:58.840 --> 01:33:07.240
uh, two new robots, you have, uh, Atlas and Peabody as in P dash body. And they do also

01:33:07.240 --> 01:33:14.520
make a cameo in the single player, uh, campaign. If you are quick and you have to be quick to see

01:33:14.520 --> 01:33:23.400
them. Um, but you, you have like signals and pings and stuff, you know, which actually I wonder if

01:33:23.400 --> 01:33:27.480
that's kind of where dead by daylight might've gotten some of that or from journey, maybe

01:33:27.480 --> 01:33:32.440
where since survivors can't really talk to each other unless you're, you know, in discord or

01:33:32.440 --> 01:33:40.600
something, you signal things so they can ping each other and signal, um, to state their intent. Um,

01:33:42.120 --> 01:33:49.800
their, the writing in this is absolutely astounding. I mean, it's so good. So good.

01:33:49.800 --> 01:34:00.440
Voice acting is so good. Um, the, the only thing, um, that there was a problem going on is that

01:34:00.440 --> 01:34:06.920
there was a very, and I'm just going to say it out, Raul, a very, uh, rapey scene that, um,

01:34:08.040 --> 01:34:13.560
it actually was voiced, uh, Ellen McClain did her, her part of it as GLaDOS. Well, not as GLaDOS,

01:34:13.560 --> 01:34:23.080
but as, uh, um, why can't I think of her name, um, as the human person that GLaDOS is based off of,

01:34:23.720 --> 01:34:34.120
um, like for like just a moment, my brain absolutely cannot remember her name anyway.

01:34:34.200 --> 01:34:44.680
Um, but at any rate, um, uh, the cave Johnson lines, um, basically, uh, JK Simmons refused

01:34:44.680 --> 01:34:55.240
to record them. Um, so that's very, uh, very cringy. Um, why can't I remember her name?

01:34:57.960 --> 01:35:01.640
This is going to really bother me now because I can't remember her name.

01:35:02.280 --> 01:35:08.760
Mike Deft is suggesting Miranda. No, it's not Miranda. It's, um, okay, screw it. I'm going

01:35:08.760 --> 01:35:16.120
to look up her name. Uh, looking at chat for some other comments, um, tiger claw pointing out portal

01:35:16.120 --> 01:35:19.960
two was one of the first games that was kind of cross platform. You buy the PlayStation three

01:35:19.960 --> 01:35:24.680
version and it gives you the PC version and you sign into your steam account in the PC or PS3

01:35:24.680 --> 01:35:28.120
version. Yeah. I remember that. That was really cool. So the only game that did that.

01:35:28.120 --> 01:35:38.200
Okay. So, um, so get ready to catch me. It still is not, uh, she was, um, Caroline.

01:35:40.200 --> 01:35:46.040
That was your name was Caroline. Yep. Yep. Um, and I knew it didn't start with an M.

01:35:47.400 --> 01:35:56.280
Um, but at any rate, I mean, it's just so well done and I love Stephen merchant so much,

01:35:56.280 --> 01:36:03.720
especially as, uh, um, Wheatley, I mean, it just made everything. Everything was so wonderful

01:36:03.720 --> 01:36:13.880
about that game. Um, so, um, it also has been used, um, in education, uh, believe it or not.

01:36:13.880 --> 01:36:19.880
Um, there was called teach with portals and steam for school that use portal to,

01:36:19.880 --> 01:36:26.200
important to puzzle maker for education. Um, it was free, but it had a single player campaign

01:36:26.200 --> 01:36:33.720
and puzzle maker was only for steam for school users. Um, so it was teaching how to solve puzzles

01:36:33.720 --> 01:36:41.720
and create critical thinking. Although some people were, um, upset with the whole quote,

01:36:41.720 --> 01:36:49.480
gamification of learning. So, um, and they, uh, there was also research in 2016 that demonstrated

01:36:49.480 --> 01:36:55.560
that the portal to puzzle maker can be used to measure fluid intelligence. Um, so, and it was

01:36:55.560 --> 01:37:05.480
referred to as the portal to test battery. Hmm. So that was also pretty neat. Um, it was, I mean,

01:37:05.480 --> 01:37:12.680
it, it sold amazingly well people to this day still love and play it. Um, and it actually

01:37:13.480 --> 01:37:22.680
was subject to, um, some mods. Um, so remember I was saying that Chell was supposed to have

01:37:22.680 --> 01:37:29.960
like a twin or a clone or something. Her name was Mel. And so, um, someone did portal stories, Mel,

01:37:30.680 --> 01:37:39.880
um, where they did, uh, a mod for portal where you could have Mel and Chell. Um,

01:37:39.880 --> 01:37:45.640
there's aperture tag, the paint gun testing initiative, where it's a single player

01:37:45.640 --> 01:37:53.160
modification, um, that basically replaces the portal gun with a gel gun. Um, that makes it

01:37:53.160 --> 01:37:58.840
kind of like tag, the power of paint, which tag, the power of paint is where those gels were

01:37:58.840 --> 01:38:05.320
originated. Um, and that game may come up cause I've done an arbacular drop. So, um, there's also

01:38:05.320 --> 01:38:13.240
thinking with time machine, um, which is, uh, a, uh, mod that gives you the ability to record

01:38:13.240 --> 01:38:18.840
actions that can be played back by a duplicate player, um, and allows for the use of a second

01:38:18.840 --> 01:38:23.320
set of portals. And then there's portal reloaded, which is, um, a single player mod for portal two,

01:38:24.040 --> 01:38:30.440
um, that came out on my birthday this year, cause the game came out on my birthday in, uh,

01:38:30.440 --> 01:38:37.880
10 years ago. And it lets you use a third portal called the time portal to travel between the

01:38:37.880 --> 01:38:48.360
present and future versions of each test chamber. And so on that note, I will say that portal two

01:38:49.080 --> 01:38:55.480
deserves its place as a classic game and is still among one of my favorite modern classics.

01:38:56.120 --> 01:39:02.760
I think it was definitely just a matter of when this game would be eligible, which it may be the

01:39:02.760 --> 01:39:08.040
biggest surprise in this segment is that yes, this game is 10 years old and you are 10 years older.

01:39:10.040 --> 01:39:15.240
Uh, and it's now eligible. It came out on my birthday. Yeah. Uh, and just somebody in chat

01:39:15.240 --> 01:39:21.240
pointed out, uh, it was, uh, who said it? Uh, Oh yeah. Mike Deaf said, by the way, portal two

01:39:21.240 --> 01:39:26.280
launched during that big Sony hack. Yeah. This was during that period when, um, PlayStation three,

01:39:26.280 --> 01:39:32.600
uh, it was offline, I think for a pretty good chunk of the period. Um, you know, I do have

01:39:32.600 --> 01:39:39.800
potato potatoes quotes. Okay. Um, still as my ring, ringtones on, uh, on my phone,

01:39:40.360 --> 01:39:47.160
like my favorite one, look at you flying like an E flying majestically like an Eagle piloting a

01:39:47.160 --> 01:39:56.120
blimp. Glados is the queen of reads the queen of the shady read. The library is always open with

01:39:56.120 --> 01:40:01.240
her. You know, uh, thank you for bringing portal to, of course, this is the game we talked about.

01:40:01.240 --> 01:40:04.520
I mean, it's funny cause you know, the show has been around long enough where we talked a lot

01:40:04.520 --> 01:40:08.200
about this game when it came out and somebody in chat reminded us, this was our game of the year

01:40:08.200 --> 01:40:15.960
in 2011. Like obviously, um, this is an amazing game. I have to say what, why, why will, why won't

01:40:15.960 --> 01:40:21.000
valve do portal three? It's so disappointing that they won't do a third game because they

01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:27.720
can't count to three. I, I get, I realize this is valves mo, but I mean, I love this game in a way

01:40:27.720 --> 01:40:32.040
that, you know, I don't have the same feelings about like, you know, half life and stuff like

01:40:32.040 --> 01:40:37.640
that, that, which yes, I realize this has been awful, but I don't have, you know, this is the

01:40:37.640 --> 01:40:42.120
one I really want to see a three of. And it's just, it's, it's blows my mind that yeah, at

01:40:42.120 --> 01:40:48.440
least there was a half-life Alex, which is for some folks is a half-life three. When are we ever

01:40:48.440 --> 01:40:57.560
going to see this series continue? Well, and we, we, uh, I just think that, uh, I almost said

01:40:57.560 --> 01:41:05.080
aperture. Um, I think valve needs to go talk to whoever at Capcom learned how to count to three

01:41:05.080 --> 01:41:14.120
and teach them how to count. If Capcom could do it, so can valve. Uh, orange, right. And chat

01:41:14.120 --> 01:41:18.760
says portal VR wouldn't work. No, I absolutely agree with that. Uh, and I realized, you know,

01:41:18.760 --> 01:41:23.880
a lot of valves interests, oh, make everybody vomit. Like, you know, even I enjoy VR and,

01:41:23.880 --> 01:41:28.040
and it would still make me vomit. Like it would be too much. Would totally play it. I would totally

01:41:28.040 --> 01:41:33.000
play it. And I, you know, you know, I'm sure somebody's already modded the first two games

01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:40.600
to work with VR, um, have fun, but you know, not, not so much for me. Um, but yeah, it's just,

01:41:40.600 --> 01:41:47.160
it's so sad that, you know, I don't know, maybe they just figured they cannot top this game.

01:41:47.160 --> 01:41:52.360
And I suppose that's something I just have to accept as a fan is that they cannot top this game.

01:41:52.920 --> 01:41:58.040
And so they're not going to try. And it's that, but it's just, damn, I really wish this,

01:41:58.040 --> 01:42:07.320
this universe could continue, you know? Yeah. Uh, Bobby does say there is a officially endorsed

01:42:07.320 --> 01:42:15.960
portal VR game. It's portal, a portal stories VR. So. All right. And it is not portal.

01:42:17.960 --> 01:42:21.880
It's just endorsed. All right. Uh, but anyway, yeah, I'd love to see a full portal three,

01:42:21.880 --> 01:42:26.840
but I think I just kind of have to accept, uh, valve does not feel this can ever be talked. And

01:42:26.840 --> 01:42:31.240
I guess that is that. So, all right. But great pick for the classic game of the week.

01:42:31.240 --> 01:42:35.960
Love portal to love the original love this one, uh, portal to your classic game of the week.

01:42:35.960 --> 01:42:42.840
Yes. It's 10 years old. All right. You're welcome. Uh, tiger claw does also remind us,

01:42:42.840 --> 01:42:48.600
uh, a few weeks ago, I read that JJ Abrams said a portal movie is in the works. I remember hearing

01:42:48.600 --> 01:42:55.960
about that recently too. Um, I believe nothing until I see it. I think the fandom is going to

01:42:55.960 --> 01:43:02.360
be very irritated when Ella McLean is not the voice of GLaDOS. Like, I think there's just a

01:43:02.360 --> 01:43:08.360
lot of fans. If she is, then I think we have a different conversation. Absolutely. But I think

01:43:08.360 --> 01:43:12.520
there's a lot of people that are going to reject this movie when they put some AAA actress as the

01:43:12.520 --> 01:43:17.400
voice of GLaDOS instead, but we'll see. I don't know. Maybe they will. Hey, if they did get Ella

01:43:17.400 --> 01:43:24.520
McLean to do it, I'd be thrilled. She deserves it. I do have to point out when we got the

01:43:24.600 --> 01:43:30.040
transformers movie, who else was our optimist prime? Yeah, it was Leonard Nimoy, right?

01:43:30.600 --> 01:43:39.160
No, Leonard Nimoy was Galvatron in the animated movie. I'm talking about the more recent ones.

01:43:40.200 --> 01:43:44.040
I forget who did do it. Was it, uh, not Frank Welker.

01:43:48.360 --> 01:43:53.240
Well, who did my headphones go out? I think, I think so. Who did do it? I don't know.

01:43:53.800 --> 01:44:02.360
You brought it up. No, it was Peter Cullen. Oh, that's right. Frank Welker was someone else.

01:44:03.800 --> 01:44:09.080
Oh, Dark Tetsuya does remind, they got her to be in Pacific Rim, right? Oh yeah. I forgot that

01:44:09.080 --> 01:44:15.080
was a thing, but you know, it'll be interesting to see if they, but I just, I cannot envision GLaDOS

01:44:15.080 --> 01:44:19.880
without Ella McLean. I just can't do it. And I know this happens in Hollywood all the time that

01:44:19.880 --> 01:44:26.360
they would recast it, but I just, I don't know. So, all right. Anyhow. All right. Thank you for

01:44:26.360 --> 01:44:30.200
the classic Game of the Week. We've talked plenty about Portal, but it is such a good game. Let's

01:44:30.200 --> 01:44:34.280
get into some rapid fire news, travel around the world and quickly check out some other headlines

01:44:34.280 --> 01:44:43.080
from around the globe. Loki. All right. So there's been a delay with another game because of COVID

01:44:43.080 --> 01:44:48.120
and this game of course is going to be King of Fighters 15, which is delayed now to 2022.

01:44:48.840 --> 01:44:53.320
And I mean, this is, we've heard this a million times already, but

01:44:53.320 --> 01:44:56.040
yet another one you'll have to wait a little bit longer for.

01:44:58.360 --> 01:45:03.080
This is pretty cool. So relatively new game. EA has this game called Knockout City,

01:45:03.080 --> 01:45:08.840
which is a massive multiplayer kind of a dodge ball game. And they've already seen

01:45:08.840 --> 01:45:12.920
5 million account signups across all their platforms since launch,

01:45:13.800 --> 01:45:17.480
which is pretty impressive considering it launched, you know, not that long ago.

01:45:17.480 --> 01:45:20.600
I have some friends that talk about this game a lot and want me to play it. I just haven't gotten

01:45:20.600 --> 01:45:24.280
around to it yet, but I probably will check it out. Aside from the trailer that we saw during

01:45:24.280 --> 01:45:29.480
that one Nintendo Direct, I haven't really checked it out yet. It is apparently on Games Pass as

01:45:29.480 --> 01:45:34.600
well. So that's one way to check it out. Oh yeah. Cause EA play is on Game Pass. So that's one way

01:45:34.600 --> 01:45:40.200
to check it out. So yeah, I need to get around to anybody in chat playing this game. Part of that

01:45:40.200 --> 01:45:46.840
5 million. Legend of Zaku says it's the next Fortnite. It might be that next, I don't know,

01:45:46.920 --> 01:45:51.400
Fortnite is going to kind of always do its own thing, I think. Because Fortnite, remember,

01:45:51.400 --> 01:45:55.480
Fortnite isn't a game. Remember? There was that whole thing that came out of the recent,

01:45:55.480 --> 01:46:03.320
you know, headlines of Epic and all that. I think that there's games that kind of come and go with

01:46:03.320 --> 01:46:08.200
the popular, like Fall Guys, Among Us. And not to say those games aren't still popular. There's

01:46:08.200 --> 01:46:11.880
lots of people that love them, but they certainly, right, they were the front page, Twitch and all

01:46:11.880 --> 01:46:15.480
that stuff. And I think Knockout City is kind of like, if it's not there yet, it's going to be one

01:46:15.480 --> 01:46:20.680
of those big games pretty soon here as more and more people are checking it out. So.

01:46:22.360 --> 01:46:27.640
Bonz006 says, I see the game, but and a Knockout City. Pastelpaca says, I've played it a bit. It's

01:46:27.640 --> 01:46:33.640
fun, but in regards to dodgeball inspired games, I prefer Robot Roller Derby Disco Dodgeball. See,

01:46:33.640 --> 01:46:38.120
nothing is going to top the Kunio Kun Super Dodgeball for me. That's just the reality.

01:46:38.920 --> 01:46:41.880
That will always be the best dodgeball game. You're not going to be able to change my mind.

01:46:42.840 --> 01:46:48.120
The Neo Geo, I mean, they had the NES one as well, which is all right. But the Neo Geo one is like

01:46:48.120 --> 01:46:54.280
classic. So. All right. That's the whole reason to get a Neo Geo cabinet is play that game again.

01:46:54.280 --> 01:47:03.480
All right. Anyhow. Sorry. I digress. Dark Saga. So for Pride Month, the game Tell Me Why is free

01:47:03.800 --> 01:47:11.960
on Steam. So for the entire month of June, you can go download it so that you can experience

01:47:13.720 --> 01:47:22.200
the story for yourself of one of the characters in the game is transgender. And so it will,

01:47:22.840 --> 01:47:28.120
it's good to sort of put yourself in that person's shoes, especially since this has been

01:47:28.120 --> 01:47:37.080
this year so far, there have been more than 100 bills passed restricting the rights of

01:47:37.080 --> 01:47:43.400
transgender people. So definitely give this one a play. I believe it may also be free in the Xbox

01:47:43.400 --> 01:47:46.520
ecosystem as well, because I was looking at the store the other day and it said, but I don't know

01:47:46.520 --> 01:47:53.480
if that was a game pass thing, but just a heads up, it may be free there as well. Okay. And then

01:47:53.960 --> 01:48:00.920
Arcade went up, put out a teaser, a very pixelated pink sprinkled donuts,

01:48:02.120 --> 01:48:11.080
which is basically a big reference to them doing a Simpsons game. So you wanted Simpsons 4 player,

01:48:11.080 --> 01:48:19.240
you're getting Simpsons 4 player. And Simpsons is on there. The other games that were in the

01:48:19.240 --> 01:48:23.320
leak that we talked about what a couple of weeks ago, two weeks ago when we were last live, yeah,

01:48:23.320 --> 01:48:28.120
probably going to be included. We'll see, which was Tron and PAW Patrol, which I'm sure some

01:48:28.120 --> 01:48:37.240
people are very excited about, but also breaking news before OLR tonight. Bobby caught this on his

01:48:37.240 --> 01:48:43.320
show is that apparently the entire YouTube trailer for the Simpsons machine leak. So it's,

01:48:43.320 --> 01:48:48.920
it's happening. The Simpsons machine is absolutely 100% happening. The YouTube is out there.

01:48:49.720 --> 01:48:56.200
You can't, no take backsies on that one. Now we are inferring that because, well, the leak for the

01:48:56.200 --> 01:49:02.680
Simpsons was true then also, but we don't have a full YouTube yet for the Tron thing, but Arcade

01:49:02.680 --> 01:49:08.360
went up is one of the virtual exhibitors at E3. So this would be a great time for them to put out

01:49:08.360 --> 01:49:13.960
that trailer in this next couple of weeks. So fingers and toes. Well, I mean, I'm already kind

01:49:13.960 --> 01:49:18.920
of like, you know, having my God damn it moment because, you know, I'm going to have to shell out

01:49:18.920 --> 01:49:24.600
the money for that cabinet, but I'm not going to lie. I want that fucking cabinet. So there you

01:49:24.600 --> 01:49:30.200
have it. Well, you know what else leaked out though on Twitter with all that stuff. Apparently

01:49:30.200 --> 01:49:37.000
there is a countertop. So it's the smaller machine, but a super Pac-Man. Now super Pac-Man is in like

01:49:37.000 --> 01:49:42.440
the Pac-Man 40th edition cabinet or all that stuff. But I love me some super Pac-Man. I'm

01:49:42.440 --> 01:49:45.720
almost tempted to get that countertop, to be honest. I don't even know what other games are in it.

01:49:46.680 --> 01:49:54.280
But at least the countertops are smaller. So there is that. Yeah. Fifth Dream in chat says,

01:49:54.280 --> 01:49:58.920
I really want to get that Tron machine and really LED it up. Yeah. Those like, you know,

01:49:58.920 --> 01:50:05.880
you know who is really attracted to the lights on the cabinets is Mr. Smoosh, my cat. So I actually

01:50:05.880 --> 01:50:11.480
had grandpa from Hoard House was over here at the house over the weekend. We were hanging out for a

01:50:11.480 --> 01:50:16.120
little bit and I was showing him the arcade cabinet because it'd been so long since he'd

01:50:16.120 --> 01:50:21.160
been here, right? Cause the pandemic, I got that machine about a year ago when the pandemic was in

01:50:21.160 --> 01:50:25.640
full swing for my birthday. So I showed him the cabinet and I turned it on. And as soon as the

01:50:25.640 --> 01:50:30.520
light on that machine went on, I hadn't turned it on in a while. As soon as it turned on, Mr. Smoosh

01:50:30.520 --> 01:50:35.560
was in Matt's lap. And then all of a sudden Smoosh like looks at the machine, his eyes get gigantic.

01:50:35.560 --> 01:50:40.840
And then he like hops his way over to the machine and jumps up on the controls to like press his

01:50:40.840 --> 01:50:48.200
face against the LED screen. Like I guess Mr. Smoosh loves himself in arcade cabinets. So

01:50:48.200 --> 01:50:51.080
he's going to have two of them pretty soon when that Tron one shows up.

01:50:51.800 --> 01:50:58.120
So yeah, he just better not ruin that special Tron joystick. Cause you know, you can't have

01:50:58.120 --> 01:51:02.280
the Tron machine without that special joystick. I don't even know what to call it. I have like

01:51:02.280 --> 01:51:09.240
that trigger finger thing is very cool. Yeah. All right. Yeah. It's that thing. That thing,

01:51:09.240 --> 01:51:13.320
the Tron joystick. All right. Let's travel around the world and check out release dates.

01:51:13.320 --> 01:51:16.040
I think I heard we have a big week this week, right? Loki?

01:51:17.240 --> 01:51:22.600
We have a few things coming out. So it looks like we've got Chivalry 2 on PC, PlayStation

01:51:22.600 --> 01:51:30.280
4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One and Xbox Series X, Edge of Eternity on PC, Neptunia Reverse

01:51:43.480 --> 01:51:51.000
PC. We have Phantasy Star Online, New Genesis, I'm sorry, Phantasy Star Online 2, New Genesis,

01:51:51.000 --> 01:51:57.720
coming out on PC, Xbox One and Xbox Series X in North America and PC, Nintendo Switch and

01:51:57.720 --> 01:52:06.280
PlayStation 4 in Japan. Chicory, A Colorful Tale on PC, Mac, PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5.

01:52:07.560 --> 01:52:15.400
Looks like we've got Final Fantasy 7 Remake Integrate on PlayStation 5, Ninja Gaiden Master

01:52:15.400 --> 01:52:22.360
Collection on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. Nintendo Switch is getting Game

01:52:22.360 --> 01:52:30.360
Builder Garage, Guilty Gear Strive on PC, PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5, Ratchet and

01:52:30.360 --> 01:52:38.920
Clank Rift Apart on PlayStation 5. And I believe that's everything. All right, let's go to Japan

01:52:38.920 --> 01:52:43.800
right now. Pack your bags. Coming out of Japan this week, Game Builder Garage also gets a release

01:52:43.800 --> 01:52:50.040
in Japan this week. And that Ninja Gaiden Master Collection is also out in Japan this week. Those

01:52:50.040 --> 01:52:55.640
both on the Nintendo Switch, of course. Looking at PlayStation 5, Japan also gets the Final Fantasy

01:52:55.640 --> 01:52:59.000
7 Remake Integrate. Of course, you know, it's going to be the same time we get it here in the

01:52:59.000 --> 01:53:04.600
US. That shouldn't be a big surprise to anybody. Also, Ratchet and Clank Rift Apart also getting

01:53:04.600 --> 01:53:09.320
its Japanese release. Guilty Gear Strive also coming out this week. This is really one of those

01:53:09.320 --> 01:53:13.800
rare weeks where it's like the release calendar is like exactly the same between the two countries,

01:53:13.800 --> 01:53:19.000
to be honest. It's very similar. And then PlayStation 4 also has Guilty Gear Strive this

01:53:19.000 --> 01:53:23.640
week. So check it out. How about Europe? I imagine it's going to be a broken record, but let's see.

01:53:23.640 --> 01:53:28.200
How about Europe, DarkSakura? Yeah, pretty, pretty light. So on the 8th,

01:53:28.200 --> 01:53:35.880
we have Descenders. We have Elder Scrolls Online Blackwood, Chivalry 2. On the 10th,

01:53:35.880 --> 01:53:41.640
we have Tour de France 2021. We are Football, which is actual football and not American football.

01:53:42.680 --> 01:53:49.000
Final Fantasy 7 Remake Integrate. And on the 11th, we have the Persistence Enhanced,

01:53:49.560 --> 01:53:52.920
Ratchet and Clank Rift Apart and Guilty Gear Strive.

01:53:57.000 --> 01:54:02.760
All right, that's it. That's it. All right, let's move on. And we appropriately after what

01:54:02.760 --> 01:54:06.440
Loki had said earlier tonight, I think Loki is going to update us on the Minecraft world, right?

01:54:07.320 --> 01:54:15.240
Yeah, I actually follow this up a lot. So one of the more popular streamers and speed runners is

01:54:15.320 --> 01:54:23.240
Dream. And not that long ago, he was accused of cheating in Minecraft speed runs, because

01:54:23.960 --> 01:54:30.680
the percentage. So one of the strats that they use for speedrunning in Minecraft 116 now is the

01:54:30.680 --> 01:54:35.800
Piglin Bartering, which you can drop gold in front of a Piglin, they'll, you know, trade you some

01:54:35.800 --> 01:54:44.840
random item, and they use that to get ender pearls. And so he had manipulated the game in a way,

01:54:44.840 --> 01:54:50.920
or the alleged, you know, they alleged originally that he manipulated the basically the randomness

01:54:50.920 --> 01:54:57.240
of that. So he increased the percentage chance drop by modifying loop tables to drop those ender

01:54:57.240 --> 01:55:05.320
pearls more often. And so then he denied it originally. And, you know, put out this long winded

01:55:06.920 --> 01:55:12.040
analyst video where he had a statistician look at, you know, everything in the game and said,

01:55:12.040 --> 01:55:17.000
Oh, no, it's not impossible that the percentage drops that he got, but it was like it was

01:55:17.000 --> 01:55:21.320
ridiculous. Like he would be like the most luckiest person in the world to have that kind of

01:55:21.320 --> 01:55:30.600
luck in the games. Well, come to find out, he admitted to in a pay spin saying that, yep, he

01:55:30.600 --> 01:55:37.000
did cheat. He did put or create a modification to allow him to have better drops on those.

01:55:37.640 --> 01:55:43.240
But he was using it for some other types of runs, like for his manhunt series and stuff like that.

01:55:44.520 --> 01:55:52.440
But he accidentally left it on for six of his live streams for his speed runs. So

01:55:54.440 --> 01:56:02.520
accidentally did that. But then, of course, you know, so I don't know, it's just ridiculous.

01:56:03.080 --> 01:56:06.200
I don't know why he needed to do that. He's already a great speed runner.

01:56:06.920 --> 01:56:11.960
Granted, he's not going to be he doesn't have the top spots anymore because they've been taken down.

01:56:11.960 --> 01:56:19.000
But but just kind of ruins his credit. It's one of those things where he didn't know what to do

01:56:19.000 --> 01:56:22.680
and he wasn't the best anymore. And it's unfortunate. You kind of hear these stories

01:56:22.680 --> 01:56:29.080
sometimes where somebody is trying to well, you know, it's without going too late. I'm going to

01:56:29.080 --> 01:56:33.240
open this can of worms. It's a lot of the accusations around the Billy Mitchell thing,

01:56:34.040 --> 01:56:39.080
right? He's also pretty young. Oh, yeah, for sure. But I mean, it's a similar type of thing

01:56:39.080 --> 01:56:43.640
when it's like if you believe Billy Mitchell is lying about everything. I'm not going there

01:56:43.640 --> 01:56:49.160
tonight, but it's then you would say that it's a similar thing where if, you know, when you're

01:56:49.160 --> 01:56:53.000
when you're not number one in the world anymore, you don't know what else to do and you have to

01:56:53.000 --> 01:56:59.080
cheat to get your way back to number one. Right. Exactly. Look, look, look at the former president

01:57:01.640 --> 01:57:06.360
willing to cheat to try to get back anyway. Yeah, I know. I know.

01:57:07.880 --> 01:57:11.960
So originally, like they're saying, you know, the odds of like what he got was like something

01:57:11.960 --> 01:57:17.720
that one points one in seven point five trillion odds. Obviously, that's ridiculous. But,

01:57:18.520 --> 01:57:25.160
uh, you know, it is what it is. It's weird, though, like now he's also like taking down

01:57:25.160 --> 01:57:29.640
that post. But obviously, people saw it in the Internet. So once it's on the Internet,

01:57:29.640 --> 01:57:34.920
it's always on the Internet. Just weird. But yeah, that's just that's your that's catching

01:57:34.920 --> 01:57:42.840
you up on your your Minecraft speedrunning drama there in non speedrunning drama. So Minecraft is

01:57:42.840 --> 01:57:48.280
actually removed a shout out to 4chan because you may remember when you started Minecraft,

01:57:48.280 --> 01:57:52.360
they have kind of little blurbs in the near the logo talking just like little funny things in

01:57:52.360 --> 01:58:00.360
there. Well, one of them apparently had, you know, kind of a mention of V on there or movie

01:58:01.240 --> 01:58:06.440
because that's one of the sub channels for 4chan. So they have now removed that from the game as

01:58:06.440 --> 01:58:12.440
well. One other bigger update, though, 1.17, the brand new version is actually coming out on

01:58:12.440 --> 01:58:16.680
Tuesday, which is pretty exciting. So they're adding lots of updates to that. Originally,

01:58:16.680 --> 01:58:22.520
caves and cliffs was supposed to be a lot bigger and redesigning the whole cave generation into

01:58:22.520 --> 01:58:27.480
the game. But it's a massive undertaking that they're actually splitting up into multiple

01:58:27.480 --> 01:58:32.440
releases. So this next release is just adding some more blocks, adding some new mobs and stuff like

01:58:32.440 --> 01:58:41.400
or new, I guess, passive mobs in the game. But 1.18 is going to like completely redesign the

01:58:41.400 --> 01:58:45.320
cave generation stuff. It's going to be ridiculous, but that's not supposed to come out to holiday,

01:58:45.320 --> 01:58:50.680
but still pretty cool. Yeah. When's when series X supposed to get some of those graphical upgrades

01:58:50.680 --> 01:58:54.120
that like the Nvidia stuffs beginning? Because like when I watch your stream and like the water

01:58:54.120 --> 01:58:58.840
effects and stuff, I'm like Dan or your your YouTube's water. I love the look of that. And

01:58:58.840 --> 01:59:05.240
it's not in the series X version. No, that's OptiFine and BSL shaders. So that's included

01:59:05.240 --> 01:59:11.400
with OptiFine usually. And it really doesn't take much to run that. It looks so nice.

01:59:12.840 --> 01:59:19.160
Really like the way it looks. It does break some plugins I have like that. I if I wanted to do

01:59:19.160 --> 01:59:23.800
different visualizations like they have stuff where you can, you know, for building farms and

01:59:23.800 --> 01:59:28.120
things like that, you can see what the spawn area is and it will generate like a sphere around you

01:59:28.120 --> 01:59:32.120
and stuff like that. I can't see any of that if I because I'm playing with shaders on,

01:59:32.760 --> 01:59:35.720
I would have to switch it off. But I just don't use those.

01:59:37.000 --> 01:59:43.320
All right. Let's move on and talk about this is a little more in the rumor category,

01:59:43.320 --> 01:59:48.200
but this has been a source of spoilers before and I'm talking about Walmart Canada.

01:59:48.200 --> 01:59:53.960
Remember when they completely ruined E3 one year? I think that was what, 2019? They completely

01:59:53.960 --> 01:59:59.080
ruined E3, Walmart Canada with all these releases. Well, who knows if they're trolling

01:59:59.080 --> 02:00:05.720
or what's going on? I don't know, but here it is. A listing popped up this week for Metroid on the

02:00:05.720 --> 02:00:12.440
Nintendo Switch. And obviously it had fake box art. It wasn't real. It was literally like black

02:00:12.440 --> 02:00:17.320
text that said Metroid on a white box, but it was there. There is no Metroid game on the Nintendo

02:00:17.320 --> 02:00:22.440
Switch right now. It is interesting to note they didn't call it Metroid Prime 4. The reason why

02:00:22.440 --> 02:00:27.160
I bring this up, there were already rumors, but we really kind of filed those in the,

02:00:27.160 --> 02:00:31.720
okay, y'all, this is like, like, I don't even know if I believe this, but people are saying

02:00:31.720 --> 02:00:36.440
that there may be a new 2D Metroid game that is locked, loaded, ready to go for Nintendo Switch,

02:00:36.440 --> 02:00:42.440
and it's getting announced at E3. Some rumors say it's a Super Metroid remake in the vein of

02:00:42.440 --> 02:00:49.240
Metroid Zero Mission. I love Metroid. I love 2D Metroid. I'm not holding my breath or setting

02:00:49.240 --> 02:00:57.160
expectations because this is the rumor they try to get you with every time, but Walmart Canada

02:00:57.160 --> 02:01:03.240
doing this just to troll, I don't know if I buy that either. This is a little bit, there's smoke

02:01:03.240 --> 02:01:09.240
here and there might be a fire. How very un-Canadian of them. Exactly. Exactly. That

02:01:09.240 --> 02:01:16.360
would not be very Canadian of them to pull a stunt like this. How very. So who knows?

02:01:16.680 --> 02:01:23.880
Um, I suppose they could announce something at E3 or they might not, quite frankly, because it seems

02:01:23.880 --> 02:01:28.920
that some of the prior rumors about things we were supposed to hear about at E3, like a Switch Pro,

02:01:28.920 --> 02:01:33.800
may not actually be happening. So Nintendo may have flipped the entire fucking script this E3.

02:01:33.800 --> 02:01:39.480
I don't know, but I think this is interesting. If we take the prior rumor as true that the

02:01:39.480 --> 02:01:44.440
Metroid game on Switch is pretty much done and it's coming out sooner rather than later,

02:01:46.760 --> 02:01:51.960
then this might be the surprise announcement at E3. We know Nintendo can announce games

02:01:51.960 --> 02:01:57.320
and have them out on the market in six weeks. Garage Builder games. They just did it. Just

02:01:57.320 --> 02:02:03.080
did it. So could Nintendo announce a game that they're going to put out by Labor Day?

02:02:03.080 --> 02:02:10.040
Absolutely. It'll be interesting. I hope so. And yeah, Tiger Claw says it worked for the

02:02:10.040 --> 02:02:14.360
Return of Samus. It can work. That's right. They did that too. So it could work for Super Metroid.

02:02:14.360 --> 02:02:21.320
It sure could. Boy, oh boy, is that some holy text though, in my opinion. Super Metroid is

02:02:21.320 --> 02:02:27.880
the best video game ever made, in my opinion. Period. End of sentence. For them to redo it,

02:02:28.680 --> 02:02:36.920
that's a tall order. But honestly, Metroid Zero Mish, if Nintendo is doing it themselves,

02:02:36.920 --> 02:02:42.680
their track record on the remakes are pretty darn good. It probably will be a great game.

02:02:42.680 --> 02:02:46.840
It probably won't have all the same magic of the original, but I will probably enjoy the

02:02:46.840 --> 02:02:51.400
experience start to finish and I will absolutely buy it. But again, I don't want to set the

02:02:51.400 --> 02:02:56.120
expectation. If it's a new adventure, if it's something, fuck, if it's a repackaging of the

02:02:56.120 --> 02:03:02.040
previous Metroid games, I'm still happy to be quite honest. So we'll see. All right.

02:03:03.480 --> 02:03:10.840
Let's move on. Dark Sakura. So, you know, there's a game that everyone loves to hate on,

02:03:10.840 --> 02:03:16.280
I guess, or loves to rib. And that is, of course, the Super Mario Brothers movie

02:03:17.480 --> 02:03:27.560
that came out in 93 and basically was chopped and edited into, like, a bunch of crap.

02:03:29.000 --> 02:03:34.600
If you've ever watched the documentary about the making of this movie, it is absolutely worth it,

02:03:34.600 --> 02:03:40.440
and just to see what could have been. I mean, honestly, I think the realism factor is a little

02:03:40.440 --> 02:03:46.520
bit too much, but it could have been some gritty stuff. So anyway, there is an extended cut of

02:03:46.520 --> 02:03:55.160
Super Mario Brothers, and it's been there for years. People have been trying to compile all of

02:03:55.160 --> 02:04:02.760
these different aspects of them, you know, found footage and things from the internet and things

02:04:02.760 --> 02:04:12.360
that people put together and, you know, recovered footage. So this completed version was actually

02:04:12.360 --> 02:04:19.160
done by Rocky Morton and Annabel Jankel. This is a version that was completed before

02:04:19.800 --> 02:04:30.040
the final one had made it into the theaters. So it has been surfaced, called the Morton Jankel cut.

02:04:30.040 --> 02:04:38.840
There's been more people in the Super Mario Brothers archive community and a restorationist

02:04:38.840 --> 02:04:47.720
named Garrett Gilchrist who put together a re-edited, touched-up version of the movie,

02:04:48.280 --> 02:04:55.800
and it is available out there on the internet for those in chat. I am going to link it to you

02:04:55.800 --> 02:05:00.760
right this minute so you can watch it, preferably after you watch me stream after the show.

02:05:03.240 --> 02:05:09.080
But there you go. Well, let's ask a real talk. I watched a little bit of it. Okay, I was going

02:05:09.080 --> 02:05:14.520
to ask a real talk question. Who's going to watch it? Like, it's okay? You said you watched a little

02:05:14.520 --> 02:05:22.280
bit of it. I started and then I had stuff to do. How was it so far? It was okay. I kind of didn't

02:05:22.280 --> 02:05:27.640
know what I was watching, so I'll have to just sit more time with it when I haven't been drinking

02:05:27.640 --> 02:05:31.480
and watch it. Yeah, and the reason why I pose that question is like, it's one of those things

02:05:31.480 --> 02:05:34.680
where I'm like, okay, that's kind of neat that this exists, that someone put the time in the...

02:05:34.680 --> 02:05:41.480
I'm not going to watch it. I think I also put the wrong link in chat. Let me try this again.

02:05:42.440 --> 02:05:46.680
No, I did. That's the right one. That's a big old MP4. That's a big download. Watch your bandwidth.

02:05:47.640 --> 02:06:00.280
Well, I mean, this is just the viewing of it. So I am... Let's see. MPEG4 file is 3.7 gigabytes.

02:06:01.640 --> 02:06:07.800
That's not too bad. It says DVD part one, MP4, blah, blah, blah. Well, I'm going to download it.

02:06:07.800 --> 02:06:12.840
Why not? I've got internet. SSJ100Matt says, maybe when I go to the DMV at some point,

02:06:12.840 --> 02:06:17.240
I'll check it out. Yeah. Maybe I'll download it for my next flight. Who knows?

02:06:18.360 --> 02:06:23.240
Well, Rob, you know my love of not great movies.

02:06:23.800 --> 02:06:29.240
I know. I know. Well, I love not great movies too. Hello. How many times have I seen Showgirls?

02:06:29.240 --> 02:06:32.040
I could quote that movie. It's so bad, it's good.

02:06:32.040 --> 02:06:32.840
You don't know shit.

02:06:35.800 --> 02:06:37.000
You are a whore, darlin'.

02:06:37.000 --> 02:06:43.720
All right. Anyhow, let's move on. Loki.

02:06:45.640 --> 02:06:55.240
So Valve is making some changes to Counter-Strike Go or CSGO, basically to try to combat some of

02:06:55.240 --> 02:07:01.000
the trolling that goes along in the game and some of the cheaters, I guess. But right now,

02:07:01.080 --> 02:07:08.200
the way Go stands is that a lot of features are available in the free-to-play version of that.

02:07:08.200 --> 02:07:12.840
But apparently you can buy Prime, which allows you to have Prime-only matchmaking, item drops,

02:07:12.840 --> 02:07:17.960
XP bonuses, and stuff like that. Along with some of those, they're saying that now they're going

02:07:17.960 --> 02:07:25.080
to be kind of putting that behind that paywall to disincentivize folks from basically creating

02:07:25.080 --> 02:07:30.120
accounts to troll and then, you know, with the intent that they may get banned and then creating

02:07:30.120 --> 02:07:36.760
another free account and that type of stuff. So the rank ladder, they said right now, has a lot

02:07:36.760 --> 02:07:45.640
of cheaters in it. And the high-ranked players are making new accounts to stump noobs and griefers

02:07:45.640 --> 02:07:51.320
are creating accounts to potentially throw the game and trolls and whatnot. So they're trying to...

02:07:52.440 --> 02:07:56.600
It's unfortunate that they're kind of hurting the community in the sense that, you know, there's

02:07:56.600 --> 02:08:01.160
probably folks that want to try that out for free, but in order to try to combat some of the stuff

02:08:01.160 --> 02:08:05.640
they're having to put it behind a paywall to try to make it a little bit harder to just create a

02:08:05.640 --> 02:08:11.880
bunch of dummy accounts and also make them more money at the same time. Yeah, but I mean, like,

02:08:11.880 --> 02:08:15.640
how much money is there to be made from Counter-Strike? How old is it? Well, I say that,

02:08:15.640 --> 02:08:20.760
but obviously this game is still... Yeah, I guess that was a dumb thing now that the words have left

02:08:20.760 --> 02:08:26.360
my mouth. But MMOs kind of have to do all this all the time to kind of prevent the

02:08:26.440 --> 02:08:30.600
exploits and all this stuff. So I guess it's not... It's just more surprising it took this long.

02:08:30.600 --> 02:08:38.120
The TLDR about it is basically before there used to be a way to earn Prime status by playing the

02:08:38.120 --> 02:08:42.520
game long enough. Now you have to actually purchase it. There's no free path to Prime.

02:08:44.680 --> 02:08:48.440
It would be easy to just stay logged in and rack up time that way, I'm sure,

02:08:48.440 --> 02:08:51.160
or, you know, do private matches with other bots or something.

02:08:51.160 --> 02:08:58.520
Something like that. Yeah. All right. Well, hey, since I bitch a lot about bandwidth and

02:08:58.520 --> 02:09:04.120
exceeding it in this day and age, here's some news that is actually a great thing because this game

02:09:04.120 --> 02:09:07.800
has a gigantic footprint. But you know what? It's one of those things where it's like,

02:09:07.800 --> 02:09:12.600
I understand it because this game is so goddamn beautiful. And that's the new Microsoft Flight

02:09:12.600 --> 02:09:19.000
Simulator. So kind of like the reboot of Flight Simulator that came out in the kind of last year,

02:09:19.000 --> 02:09:27.080
I think it was, earlier in the year. The original install size has shrunk from 170 gigabytes,

02:09:27.080 --> 02:09:33.960
yes, it was that big, to 83 gigabytes. So that's pretty awesome. And that's from notes on the most

02:09:33.960 --> 02:09:39.880
recent patch in the game. We don't know exactly what they did. Obviously, they've optimized

02:09:39.880 --> 02:09:45.400
something, but that's a hell of a lot of bandwidth to save. So they cut some corners somewhere,

02:09:45.400 --> 02:09:50.120
you know, optimized graphics on another side or something. I don't know what they did.

02:09:50.120 --> 02:09:56.600
But yeah, they've cut the footprint down a lot. This is also good knowing that the Xbox version

02:09:56.600 --> 02:10:01.160
is out pretty soon. Have they dated the Xbox version? I don't think they have. They're just

02:10:01.160 --> 02:10:05.000
saying it soon. Maybe we'll find out at E3. I bet that's one of those games we'll get updated on at

02:10:05.000 --> 02:10:13.400
E3. And it'll be good that the print is smaller for the Xbox version because like 170 gigs on

02:10:13.400 --> 02:10:18.360
that drive, you're eating so much install space for other games. You won't even be able to play

02:10:18.360 --> 02:10:22.440
hardly anything else. So I think it's great that they're getting the footprint struck down for when

02:10:22.440 --> 02:10:27.640
that comes out on Xbox. I'm excited to try it on Xbox because I think the controller and all that's

02:10:27.640 --> 02:10:33.240
really gonna take a lot of the complications out of the game. I know you can do a lot to get,

02:10:33.240 --> 02:10:37.880
but I think once they make the interface more controller friendly and for the Xbox audience,

02:10:37.880 --> 02:10:44.840
I think I'm going to be able to get into it a lot more. It's beautiful. I've watched streamers

02:10:44.840 --> 02:10:53.080
play the game and it's always a good experience. It really, really looks good. Legend of Zaku says

02:10:53.080 --> 02:10:58.360
it's compression and lots of it. Bobby Blackwolf says it was out during Summer Games Done Quick

02:10:58.360 --> 02:11:03.080
last year. Oh, I didn't realize it was that late in the year. I thought it was before the pandemic,

02:11:03.080 --> 02:11:11.640
but I guess not. You know what? I know you're right, but it's one of those things where I

02:11:11.640 --> 02:11:17.000
was only able to download it because Comcast suspended all the bandwidth caps at the beginning

02:11:17.000 --> 02:11:23.080
of the pandemic. Remember that? So I was like 190 gigabyte install, who gives a shit? And I did it.

02:11:23.080 --> 02:11:32.360
So you're right. It was that time. So, all right. Anyhow, let's see. Bonds006 says,

02:11:32.360 --> 02:11:37.640
yeah, I saw 170 gigs and was like, that's a no for me. Granted, I have a 320 gig hard drive for

02:11:37.640 --> 02:11:43.720
my PC games. Ooh, time to get three terabytes. So, all right. Anyway, I'm really looking forward

02:11:43.720 --> 02:11:49.160
to the Xbox version of the game. I want to check that out. Yeah, Zaku says I bought a new one

02:11:49.160 --> 02:11:55.400
terabytes solid state drive for the game because of the near 200 gigabyte size for it. Yeah, I bet

02:11:55.400 --> 02:11:59.880
there's lots of people on the Xbox side of the house that are going to get a new drive so they

02:11:59.880 --> 02:12:06.680
can put that game on it along with others. So, wow. August 17th, 2020. I can't believe it was

02:12:06.680 --> 02:12:13.320
that late in the year. Wow. I would say time has just flown by, except it hasn't. It's been very

02:12:13.320 --> 02:12:18.920
slow. All right. Anyhow, I think that was the last story we had on deck for tonight.

02:12:18.920 --> 02:12:22.920
So, we're going to get into the listener roundtable, which includes our mailbag.

02:12:22.920 --> 02:12:27.320
And Dark Soccer is going to hop on over there. Participate at orangelandradio.com if you want

02:12:27.320 --> 02:12:31.560
to send us email, but please not if you're a spammer because unfortunately that is something

02:12:31.560 --> 02:12:38.680
that's starting to rear its ugly head again. So, if you signed us up for that, choke. But we do

02:12:38.680 --> 02:12:42.920
have, do we have any real emails this week? I thought we have one. Yay. One email. Let's get to

02:12:42.920 --> 02:12:50.840
it. And it's a very simple email. Okay. It comes from Dee in Waterloo. Waterloo. Okay. Yes. I know

02:12:50.840 --> 02:12:56.840
Waterloo. I said that because of your, you know, your ABBA thing. Waterloo. I'm sure the listener

02:12:56.840 --> 02:13:08.760
has never heard that before. What is the most overused term in gaming? Toxic. Ooh. But it's

02:13:08.760 --> 02:13:16.120
accurate. I'm playing so much Dead by Daylight that, you know. But you say it's accurate,

02:13:16.120 --> 02:13:21.640
so does that really make it overused? They could come up with other words like asshole.

02:13:23.960 --> 02:13:32.120
Asshole survivors. Or teabagging little shits. I'm going to say, I'll say one that's kind of

02:13:32.120 --> 02:13:35.640
controversial and it's one I see in Dead by Daylight and I see it in a lot of games and I

02:13:36.520 --> 02:13:40.920
think it's getting to be a little bit of a tired expression to the point where I think people use

02:13:40.920 --> 02:13:48.840
it sometimes to be toxic. I'm going to say GG is overused. Really? Yeah. Well, it's just sort of

02:13:48.840 --> 02:13:54.040
like a tradition now. Like just, you know, GGS or. I feel like if you want to, like it would mean

02:13:54.040 --> 02:13:58.360
10 times more if you actually typed out good game and then I know you meant it. Because I think

02:13:58.360 --> 02:14:02.840
there's some people that like, let's take Dead by Daylight for instance. They fucking wipe the

02:14:02.840 --> 02:14:08.680
floor with the survivors. Then the killer puts GG, happy face. When it's like, bitch, you're

02:14:08.680 --> 02:14:13.880
just saying that because you won, you know. I appreciate the ones that'll actually be up front

02:14:13.880 --> 02:14:20.520
and say GG easy. Oh no, I think that's the worst when people say GG easy. At least I know that

02:14:20.520 --> 02:14:26.520
they're being sarcastic shits. Okay, okay. So you know, okay. I get what you mean. It

02:14:26.520 --> 02:14:28.040
quantifies it for me. Yes.

02:14:30.920 --> 02:14:34.120
Oh, well, Loki, let me let you go. And then I'm going to read the chat because

02:14:35.080 --> 02:14:43.000
chat said one. I'm like, oh, that's a good one too. Yeah, for me, it's always, well,

02:14:43.560 --> 02:14:50.920
overused in our games at least is WB and TY because everyone logging on. Welcome back.

02:14:51.720 --> 02:14:56.840
Thank you. I don't know. Um, I can't really think of anything that's like super overused

02:14:56.840 --> 02:15:02.280
aside from, you know, pog. I guess poggers. I was going to say poggers too is I'm like,

02:15:02.280 --> 02:15:07.400
I don't, I think it's like, I get it. Pogs were those little discs in the nineties.

02:15:08.040 --> 02:15:11.640
No, no. Well, like I get what the meaning is, but I think it's like,

02:15:12.280 --> 02:15:16.360
like everything is not pog. Like it's just like, you know, that could be cool, but it's not like,

02:15:16.440 --> 02:15:18.280
Oh my God. It's voggers.

02:15:24.840 --> 02:15:29.880
See, we could have gotten so much more traffic if we just called ourselves pog network.

02:15:29.880 --> 02:15:34.360
Yeah. The, the, instead of the voice of geeks network, the, uh, pantomime of geeks network,

02:15:34.360 --> 02:15:40.680
I guess, I don't know what other words starts with P is there a personification of geek.

02:15:40.680 --> 02:15:44.600
There's gotta be a pog network. There are enemy.

02:15:46.360 --> 02:15:49.480
I support all networks except that one. No, I'm just kidding. I don't even know

02:15:49.480 --> 02:15:55.160
if there is a pog or what it, what they have. Anyway. Um, let's see some comments from chat.

02:15:55.160 --> 02:16:01.400
Uh, Bobby black Wolf and Mike deaf both said F is the most overused thing. Yeah.

02:16:01.400 --> 02:16:06.200
F F is a good one. Although I kind of liked that emoji. I know one of you has it. That's

02:16:06.200 --> 02:16:13.080
like an F on a gravestone. That one's kind of funny. Um, Tiger claw says, how about LOL?

02:16:13.080 --> 02:16:16.760
That's overused. I don't think that's unique to gaming. That's not gaming,

02:16:16.760 --> 02:16:21.080
but I'm also guilty of it. I will admit I do sometimes look at my text and I'm like,

02:16:21.080 --> 02:16:27.080
I say LOL a lot, but to me, I think sometimes when I say LOL, it's to kind of like emphasize

02:16:27.080 --> 02:16:31.400
that like, I'm saying this in a positive way. Like I'm not saying this to be a Dick or something

02:16:31.400 --> 02:16:39.640
like this or whatever. Like, you know, that's funny. LOL. I don't know. Um, let's see. I'm

02:16:39.640 --> 02:16:45.000
looking, uh, fifth dream says thank you for your continued support and please look forward to it.

02:16:45.000 --> 02:16:50.040
Meaning we fucked up. Thanks for not abandoning it and don't hold your breath respectively.

02:16:52.120 --> 02:16:54.440
I like that. Or just anything on the roadmap.

02:16:56.520 --> 02:17:03.400
All right. Oh, SSU 100. Matt has linked me to a Twitter account for pog network.

02:17:04.680 --> 02:17:09.240
What I want to see what they do. They probably have like 10 times the followers. Oh no,

02:17:09.240 --> 02:17:13.960
they only have 54 followers. Oh, they're league of legends streamers. All right, cool.

02:17:14.840 --> 02:17:20.360
Poggers. All right. Well, there's, you know what, my cease and desist right now, because,

02:17:20.360 --> 02:17:26.280
because they're a small network and they're not there, they haven't, uh, broke through in a way

02:17:26.280 --> 02:17:31.800
and overused the way that acronym has. I'll say, all right, as long as you're not toxic shit bags

02:17:31.800 --> 02:17:37.080
in league of legends, cause if you think dead by daylight's bad play a match of league of legends,

02:17:37.080 --> 02:17:42.600
my God. So as long as y'all are keeping it positive, then I will say you don't have to

02:17:42.600 --> 02:17:50.280
be our enemy anymore. Pog network. Okay. All right. I'll put it this way. I just had a few

02:17:50.280 --> 02:17:55.880
people that I know who play survivor and I'm like, if you see a plague wearing this cosmetic,

02:17:55.880 --> 02:18:03.480
be nice. Cause it might be you. Well, yeah. And as far as I know, I was watching,

02:18:03.480 --> 02:18:07.240
I was watching somebody and they went up against a plague and somebody in chat said,

02:18:07.240 --> 02:18:13.640
is this dark Sakura? And I was like, yeah, she's fucking everywhere. Well, no, it was,

02:18:13.640 --> 02:18:19.960
it was a taste channel. Okay. It probably was taste channel. I told T I told T if you see a plague,

02:18:19.960 --> 02:18:27.800
be nice. And then I said, uh, when I got back, he's like, we went against the plague, but I

02:18:27.800 --> 02:18:33.640
don't think it was you. Cause you let, you let people find stuff and I was like, it probably

02:18:33.640 --> 02:18:39.000
wasn't me. Um, and then I, I sent a picture of what my cosmetic looks like. There you go.

02:18:39.000 --> 02:18:46.680
That's funny. Yeah. All right. Anyway. Um, all right. Uh, that's it for mailbag. Let's get to,

02:18:46.680 --> 02:18:50.280
uh, do you have any last minute stories, Loki? And I'm going to, and if you guys have any questions

02:18:50.280 --> 02:18:55.160
in chat, uh, please, please feel free to type away in chat. Uh, I will get as well to some of

02:18:55.160 --> 02:18:59.400
our discord submissions for this week. Loki. Yeah. I did want to mention that there is that

02:18:59.400 --> 02:19:04.280
bundle that's available on itch IO for support Palestine. Oh my God. We didn't put that in our

02:19:04.280 --> 02:19:09.720
show. I'm so sorry. This wasn't for $5. So, you know, you know, it's a pretty good, that's a

02:19:09.720 --> 02:19:15.800
pretty good price. So a thousand, I should say it's not all games, there's assets and stuff in

02:19:15.800 --> 02:19:19.400
there too, but there's a lot of games in there. So, uh, check it out. And I know that there's

02:19:19.400 --> 02:19:24.200
some nest maker games in there as well. Um, cause they posted that in our little, uh, community.

02:19:25.480 --> 02:19:31.320
Yeah. Cool. Anything else? I haven't got the channel up yet here. I'm working on it.

02:19:32.600 --> 02:19:38.120
I don't have anything. Yeah. I don't really have anything else that's worth mentioning.

02:19:38.120 --> 02:19:43.960
I make sure we're going to have lots of stuff this week. In completely like not even news. Uh,

02:19:44.760 --> 02:19:50.200
I learned that, that kind of John is on Tik TOK and that makes me happy cause she's adorable

02:19:51.080 --> 02:19:58.360
as in the wrestler Oscar. How do I use Tik TOK? Like I have a Tik TOK and I posted one thing to it

02:19:58.360 --> 02:20:02.360
Halloween of 2019 that looking back isn't even that funny. Like

02:20:02.360 --> 02:20:08.440
how do I, what do I post on Tik TOK? I have four dead by daylight clips and then me watching

02:20:08.440 --> 02:20:13.800
Oscar on TV. Okay. I guess I have seen a lot of Twitch streamers trying to like put clips from

02:20:13.800 --> 02:20:18.120
their streams as Tik TOKs, which is interesting. I mean, I guess it's a good way to promote,

02:20:18.120 --> 02:20:25.560
I guess that makes sense. Yeah. I only have a hand. I mean, my, my Tik TOK is I think dark

02:20:25.560 --> 02:20:34.440
Sakura. I just need to do more streaming. Um, so I mean, if someone wants to hold on,

02:20:34.440 --> 02:20:40.280
I'm actually going to see what the hell my Tik TOK is called. Uh, dark Sakura underscore O L R.

02:20:40.280 --> 02:20:43.560
I'm pretty sure I'm Rob Roberts, but don't follow me. I don't post anything.

02:20:44.440 --> 02:20:47.880
Y'all can follow me and then teach me the ways of the, the Tik TOKs.

02:20:48.520 --> 02:20:53.240
Yeah. The Tik TOKs. The Tik TOKs. I love Tik TOKs.

02:20:53.240 --> 02:20:59.400
More like Tik TOKs. Sorry. The only time I hear Tik TOK, I can only think of return to Oz.

02:21:00.760 --> 02:21:07.160
Oh God. Yes. I think of, I think of, uh, catching fire. Tik TOK, Tik TOK.

02:21:07.160 --> 02:21:11.000
You know, somebody I'm sure it's been done, but somebody needs to post that character,

02:21:11.000 --> 02:21:14.840
Tik TOK from return to Oz on Tik TOK and say, Hey, I heard you like Tik TOKs.

02:21:15.400 --> 02:21:19.080
Like surely has that been done? Surely someone did that. Someone did that, right?

02:21:19.880 --> 02:21:24.360
Someone's going to be corny to do that. Yeah. All right. You know, I saw that in the theater, Rob.

02:21:24.360 --> 02:21:27.880
Oh, so did I, I saw it at the, I saw it at the discount theater.

02:21:28.600 --> 02:21:34.200
I saw it when it premiered. So for you locals, so we're based out of Sacramento, California,

02:21:34.200 --> 02:21:37.480
and I know there's a few of you that are local that listen because you're kind of like,

02:21:37.480 --> 02:21:40.680
it's really surreal to hear you guys talk about local places on the show. Well,

02:21:40.680 --> 02:21:46.680
I've got one for you. Brace yourself. I saw return to Oz at the Harding cinema. Anyone

02:21:46.680 --> 02:21:52.040
remember that out in Roseville, the Harding cinema, which I think turned into a radio

02:21:52.040 --> 02:21:56.840
shack after they closed it. That's how big the Harding cinema was is that they turned it into a

02:21:56.840 --> 02:22:02.600
radio shack, but it was like 99 cent matinees during the day. And that's where I saw return

02:22:02.600 --> 02:22:10.600
to Oz. So. Hey, Rob, guess what I drove by today? Not today, but, uh, when Becky and I

02:22:10.600 --> 02:22:15.640
were on our way to San Francisco yesterday, cause it's not for coffee. Crest View Lanes.

02:22:15.640 --> 02:22:22.040
The sign is still there. Oh, oh, it's still there. The sign is the building is long gone.

02:22:22.040 --> 02:22:26.840
I was gonna say they probably made condos over there by now, but the sign is still there. And

02:22:26.840 --> 02:22:30.520
I wonder if they're just going to leave it up. Huh? I wonder, have they built anything in its

02:22:30.520 --> 02:22:37.320
place yet or no, it's still a lot weird. Yeah. But Crest View is where like we would go play.

02:22:37.320 --> 02:22:43.320
Dan and I would go play air guys and, and blazing star and sweet arcade. Yeah. Yeah. The arcade

02:22:43.320 --> 02:22:48.040
there was pretty, pretty tops. And they had, uh, they had a DDR for a hot minute. You know what

02:22:48.040 --> 02:22:54.280
arcade I haven't been to in centuries is, um, the 24 hour bowling alley. That's still there on what

02:22:54.280 --> 02:23:02.360
country club? I thought the bowling alleys were all closed. It's orange. Uh, Sacramento got

02:23:02.360 --> 02:23:07.160
promoted to orange, so they should have reopened because bowling alleys were, uh, in that. Unless

02:23:07.160 --> 02:23:10.360
for whatever reason, they don't think they can follow COVID, but I think they would have reopened

02:23:10.360 --> 02:23:17.720
by now. So I, since I've been there because I did the, you know, this was back a couple of years ago,

02:23:17.720 --> 02:23:21.720
uh, at this point because of COVID, but we used to do the, uh, laser tag circuit.

02:23:21.720 --> 02:23:27.320
And, uh, so we went there to play laser, uh, X because I haven't ever played laser X,

02:23:27.320 --> 02:23:33.240
even though I used to go there all the time for DDR. Um, but they, yeah, they completely changed

02:23:33.240 --> 02:23:37.880
up that. So they have two arcades now. Um, they have the original arcade. We used to play DDR in,

02:23:37.880 --> 02:23:44.760
which is where they have like their oversized enormous giant, like cockpit games, which is

02:23:44.760 --> 02:23:49.000
basically what everything is nowadays. So that your Jurassic parks, your giant nerve thing,

02:23:49.000 --> 02:23:54.760
um, Mario Kart, um, and try to think what else, but like racing games and stuff like that.

02:23:54.760 --> 02:24:00.120
Then they have a whole ticket section that's shoved way back, like it towards the back of

02:24:00.120 --> 02:24:03.720
the building. And they've got a whole nother section with like tickets. That's where the,

02:24:03.720 --> 02:24:07.320
that's where the nightclub used to be is where all the ticket spitters are. Yeah.

02:24:07.320 --> 02:24:12.680
Yes. Freeze pop. I used to, I used to go to the club there.

02:24:13.320 --> 02:24:16.840
Yeah. Freeze pop played there once. And now it's a, it's a room full of tickets,

02:24:16.840 --> 02:24:23.000
spitters depressing face. I know. Right. All right. Uh, okay. Sorry. Sorry. We delved into

02:24:23.000 --> 02:24:27.640
local chat, but you know what? I'm sure a lot of these stories, honestly, you could swap the names

02:24:27.640 --> 02:24:32.440
of the places and the towns. They'd probably be very similar. All right. Anyway. Uh, so some of

02:24:32.440 --> 02:24:36.360
y'all post stories throughout the week at our discord vog network.com slash discord. And I like

02:24:36.360 --> 02:24:40.760
to read some of those, uh, tiger claw posted in our channel. I think this is funny. The director

02:24:40.760 --> 02:24:45.400
of the tech and games is throwing shade at Sega and challenging the Virtua Fighter team to make

02:24:45.400 --> 02:24:52.120
a new game. Make a new game. You cowards. Okay. He didn't say that, but he did make a video.

02:24:53.400 --> 02:24:56.120
I would love it if he did actually, that'd be hilarious.

02:24:56.120 --> 02:25:02.440
Katsuhiro Harada posted on his personal YouTube channel about a Virtua Five fighter ultimate

02:25:02.440 --> 02:25:08.440
showdown coming out. And, uh, he's always viewed surpassing SEGA series as a professional goal.

02:25:09.240 --> 02:25:15.800
I love that. And I'm on his side. Uh, tiger class says, if you're into collecting Funko pops,

02:25:15.800 --> 02:25:20.840
they just announced a sly Cooper pop. Anyone, anyone collect those fun? I get them once in a

02:25:20.840 --> 02:25:25.880
great while. In fact, right next to me. Well, I guess I don't, I thought I had it next to me,

02:25:25.880 --> 02:25:31.720
but I guess not. I have a, a large, uh, Richard Simmons doll, but I had a Richard Simmons, um,

02:25:32.520 --> 02:25:36.360
Funko pop and I couldn't pass it up. I have a collection of Deadpools.

02:25:36.920 --> 02:25:44.440
Do you have mermaid Deadpool, Bob Ross, Deadpool, uh, barista Deadpool, um, scooter Deadpool,

02:25:44.440 --> 02:25:48.200
because, uh, because it reminds me of my favorite cover for cable and Deadpool.

02:25:49.320 --> 02:25:57.160
Um, it's the one where they try to redo the, uh, Acura one. And I have, I need the other two

02:25:57.160 --> 02:26:03.640
golden girls, but I have, I have, I have significant pops. I have all the golden girls

02:26:03.640 --> 02:26:08.840
over off camera. So, all right. Uh, let me do one more. And I know dark soccer, you go ahead,

02:26:08.840 --> 02:26:12.120
dark soccer, if you're going to, if you need to bow out to sort some things before, uh,

02:26:12.120 --> 02:26:17.560
after the show, uh, any final thoughts for our listeners tonight? Um, just, uh, don't be a

02:26:17.560 --> 02:26:25.960
shithole. Um, just be a nice person, be kind and, uh, stay tuned for my stream. All right.

02:26:25.960 --> 02:26:31.400
Have a good night. You do love everybody hearts. Bye. All right. Don't go anywhere just yet though,

02:26:31.400 --> 02:26:34.520
folks. We've still got a little more. I've got a few more headlines I want to read for you guys

02:26:34.520 --> 02:26:41.400
here. Uh, and that would be, uh, this one, apparently this leak is real. There is an

02:26:41.400 --> 02:26:46.920
X-com style Avengers game coming from 2k. That sounds very interesting. Uh,

02:26:48.920 --> 02:26:54.360
yeah, right. That could be very interesting. So, uh, we'll see. Hmm. Interesting. Anyway,

02:26:54.360 --> 02:26:58.600
thanks you guys for sharing some of those headlines there over at, uh, our discord

02:26:58.600 --> 02:27:04.680
channel, vognetwork.com slash discord. Um, w are we out of last minute stories, Loki?

02:27:05.720 --> 02:27:09.880
I think so for now. Yeah. All right. All right. Let me see, let me see if I can sneak in one more

02:27:09.880 --> 02:27:15.880
headline here then. Uh, let's see. Let's see. Let's see. Um, apparently some folks are talking

02:27:15.880 --> 02:27:19.800
about that. It's a little bit of a pain in the butt to transfer your save over with final fantasy

02:27:19.800 --> 02:27:25.080
seven. I didn't read too much into that. Oh, um, okay. And shopping news, I guess they dated

02:27:25.080 --> 02:27:29.560
Amazon prime day for June 21st and 22nd. I know some people don't like to get their games from

02:27:29.560 --> 02:27:33.880
there anymore, but for those that do there's that I imagine there'll be some gaming sales.

02:27:33.880 --> 02:27:41.960
Uh, so that's a thing you're into check that out, I guess. Um, Ooh, I like, I forgot this from dark

02:27:41.960 --> 02:27:48.040
Tetsuya. Okay. I really liked this. A paper boy and spy Hunter comic came out from DC.

02:27:48.680 --> 02:27:54.680
What the hell is that? Is it, um, yes, spy Hunter and paper boy. Uh, but interesting cause

02:27:54.840 --> 02:27:58.600
I replied to that and said, I don't see anywhere mentioned that it's based on the games,

02:27:58.600 --> 02:28:03.320
but why else would you combine those two things? And it's clearly a paper boy and like a dude in

02:28:03.320 --> 02:28:11.160
the car that looks like spy Hunter. That's kind of weird. Very, very weird. Um, SSU,

02:28:11.160 --> 02:28:15.560
one hundred mountain chat says question, what is the status of the show being in person again?

02:28:15.560 --> 02:28:21.400
No pressure. Just curious. I thought there was a date, but I forgot it. Um, there is not a date yet.

02:28:21.960 --> 02:28:29.480
Um, and, um, hopefully, uh, we'll have news on that in the near future. Um, there's just,

02:28:29.480 --> 02:28:34.600
there's a lot of changes going on, uh, behind the scenes and stuff. So I just don't know when that's

02:28:34.600 --> 02:28:44.040
going to happen yet. Um, but hopefully soonish. So, um, all right. Uh, let's see. Pod culture

02:28:44.040 --> 02:28:48.680
says he just found my Tik TOK. I said, don't follow me. He's in a suit and tie. Cause it was

02:28:48.680 --> 02:28:52.440
listen to the Tik TOK. It was a Halloween costume that I put together in five minutes.

02:28:52.440 --> 02:28:59.480
That should be obvious. So, all right. Um, orange right in chat says Midway arcade collection.

02:28:59.480 --> 02:29:05.720
Nah, Midway comics universe. Okay. Here's that. So, all right. Uh, I think that'll do it. Let's

02:29:05.720 --> 02:29:10.680
wrap things up. So, uh, thank you guys very much for listening to and, uh, supporting orange

02:29:10.680 --> 02:29:14.520
launch radio. Hey, if you enjoyed what you heard here at the show, tell a friend or two about the

02:29:14.520 --> 02:29:18.600
show, help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice. But, um,

02:29:18.600 --> 02:29:25.080
as long as, uh, your voice is, uh, I'm sorry, as long as, let me start over. We are the show where

02:29:25.080 --> 02:29:29.000
every gamer has a voice, but we need more voices here. So tell a friend or two about the show,

02:29:29.000 --> 02:29:33.080
help us spread the word. And, uh, we really appreciate that. A nice five star review on

02:29:33.080 --> 02:29:37.800
a site like iTunes or wherever it is you found this show goes an awful long way. Um,

02:29:39.080 --> 02:29:42.760
if you feel so inclined, we have a shop where you can buy some merchandise,

02:29:42.760 --> 02:29:47.720
vog and network.com slash shop. I keep pestering Jamie to add stuff to it. Um,

02:29:47.720 --> 02:29:52.440
cause she launched her own shop. And so I got those designs. I sent you like a long time ago.

02:29:53.080 --> 02:29:58.280
Yeah. Remember the pixel art vog thing. You are absolutely right. I need to get on that. I,

02:29:58.280 --> 02:30:01.800
you sent me a finish. You sent me an in progress fog one, right? You finished a fog one.

02:30:01.800 --> 02:30:05.880
No, I thought that was the finished one. Let me just double check. Cause I only remember seeing

02:30:05.880 --> 02:30:10.120
one in progress, but you know what? Loki it is Dan. I, with everything that happened in the

02:30:10.120 --> 02:30:16.520
past year, I absolutely could have slipped. So it sounds like something new coming soon. It sounds

02:30:16.520 --> 02:30:25.800
like, so, uh, stay tuned for that vog network.com slash shop. Um, and, uh, I think, I think that's

02:30:25.800 --> 02:30:29.800
really it. Uh, I guess we can get final thoughts as well. Uh, thank you for being here and listening

02:30:29.800 --> 02:30:34.280
to the whole show. I know it was a little bit slower of a news week, but we're on the eve of

02:30:34.280 --> 02:30:38.840
E3 slash the big June announcements, I think is really the better name for it.

02:30:38.840 --> 02:30:42.120
Now that we have summer games fest and all these other things in the mix,

02:30:42.120 --> 02:30:46.840
we're the week before the big June announcements. So, uh, it's going to be a fun week and we'll have

02:30:46.840 --> 02:30:52.040
lots and lots to talk about next week. Uh, I'm really excited for it. So, uh, Loki,

02:30:52.040 --> 02:30:56.200
why don't you give us your final thought tonight? It's going to be a very busy week for me and a

02:30:56.200 --> 02:31:00.600
very exciting week as well. So excited for you to look, look forward to talking to you guys next

02:31:00.600 --> 02:31:05.400
week. Uh, yeah, very excited to hear how it goes. Uh, even if we had to talk a lot about

02:31:05.400 --> 02:31:10.360
Xbox and Bethesda as well next week, for sure. Um, and I, I don't know if I have a lot to say,

02:31:10.360 --> 02:31:16.200
but, uh, my final thought is, um, I, I'm, I'm going to try to get on some more creation in

02:31:16.200 --> 02:31:21.160
this next week as well and, and get my own community. Like Loki's found his dark soccer's

02:31:21.160 --> 02:31:25.480
found hers and so forth. So, uh, there you go. That's going to do it for another week,

02:31:25.480 --> 02:31:28.280
