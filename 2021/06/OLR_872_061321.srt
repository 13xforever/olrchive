00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:24,240
Happy E3 Week! And that's pretty much it. God, this is a lot of time to fill. I hate

2
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:29,920
saying the same thing over and over, even a year apart. So, that's it! It's E3 Week!

3
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:35,040
What else is there to say? Let's start the show!

4
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:49,840
Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge

5
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:57,840
Radio. We've got a lot more to say. We're live once again tonight with episode number 872 of

6
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:05,280
our show for this June the 13th of 2021. I am Rob Roberts and I am joined via Discord by my co-host,

7
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:08,480
say hello first off to the one and only DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

8
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,040
Greetings and salivations.

9
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,080
Hi, how are you doing?

10
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:19,280
I am okay. I am just going into all of my various Discords and letting them know they should be

11
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:19,920
listening to us.

12
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:21,760
Getting that promotion in.

13
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:23,600
That's what I do.

14
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:27,040
Speaking of promotion, I probably am not supposed to talk about this on air,

15
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:31,520
but oops, I'll ask for forgiveness later. But I've been hearing some more DarkSakura tunes.

16
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:36,000
You sent me one this morning or yesterday and I was like,

17
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,040
when's the album dropping? When's the album dropping?

18
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:46,240
Well, most of the stuff I'm just doing is loops and I just started playing around with things

19
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:50,400
yesterday just to kind of futz around with a different style and I was trying to do like

20
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:55,600
this weird acoustic thing and it turned out like all kinds of Southern rock and my mom really likes

21
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:59,840
it. So, yay, I guess.

22
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:07,440
Good. Yeah, I think a lot of people right now are streaming Solar Power by Lorde. But, you know,

23
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:07,840
in a few weeks...

24
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:08,480
It's a good song.

25
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:09,520
Yeah, it's a good song. They're going to be...

26
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:14,560
This week has been a blessing in music. We had a new Marina album,

27
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:18,160
we had that Kylie Lady Gaga thing, which is a gift from Gay God.

28
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:21,520
We had a garbage album.

29
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,080
Your cover.

30
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:23,140
What's that?

31
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:27,600
That's not the only cover because someone covered the country Born This Way.

32
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:30,800
Oh, yeah. Orville Peck did that and then Big Freedia did Judas.

33
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,120
Big Freedia. Yeah, that was so good.

34
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,960
That whole reimagining or whatever is going to be pretty crazy. But yeah,

35
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:41,760
I was just saying this is a great week for music. So people are satisfied with music for quite some

36
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:48,960
time. And then, you know, hopefully in a few weeks, well, maybe more like a few months,

37
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:52,800
we'll have Dark Soccer to add to that list and whatever album she ends up putting out.

38
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,360
No pressure.

39
00:02:55,760 --> 00:03:02,320
No pressure. Hi, chat over at twitch.tv slash Vogue Network. And the chat is commenting that

40
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:07,600
I look a little out of focus. You know what? I bet the resolution on my camera dropped because OBS

41
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:14,880
had a small update today. And every time they do that, I see that the camera setting sometimes

42
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:19,120
reset for Dark Soccer and Loki. Not an issue because we capture them via Discord. So it

43
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:22,480
doesn't really change. So they're just coming in from Discord. But me, I think mine reset.

44
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:27,120
So I'll try to fix that. So do not adjust your sets on Twitch. I might get I might have that

45
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:30,560
whole thing I had last week where I get really big again and all that. But we'll fix all that.

46
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:32,960
I also want to say your ego.

47
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,560
Rob, Rob, it's just water weight.

48
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:40,400
Hey, hi, Loki, by the way. The first words out of your mouth tonight are shade. It must be

49
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:46,800
game convention week, that's for sure. Hey, I want to give a shout out in our chat because I just saw

50
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:52,720
Black Compat said hi hi in the chat. And I want to say hi hi and grats, grats right back at you,

51
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:56,480
Black Compat, because and if you don't know Black Compat, you should be following them,

52
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:02,240
fix that because Black Compat is the artists formerly known as Electric Sistahood, which

53
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:06,080
was on the VOG network. And we go back our little our little friendship goes back to all games back

54
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:11,120
in the day and all that. So we've been we've been frenzy's friend shows for a long time. Black

55
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:16,080
Compat just got the partner. Well, they're not partner yet, but they just applied for partner.

56
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:20,800
But that means they met the stats and all that measurement for partner. And that's a huge

57
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:25,280
accomplishment. So I just want to say congrats. And if Twitch doesn't accept you as a partner,

58
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:31,200
they are dumb. So fingers and toes crossed for you guys. So just want to give that some people

59
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:35,600
who shouldn't make partner who have made partners. So I will be super pissed.

60
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:41,680
I saw that Twitch drama this week. That was something. No, I the lovely ladies over at

61
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:47,600
Black Compat would be a huge win for Twitch. So I hope you listen in Twitch admins. Do it.

62
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,720
Yeah. All right. No Twitch admins are listening to this show.

63
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:57,680
And also unban my friend. All right. Loki, hi. How are you? How's your week been?

64
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:02,240
We're pretty good. Yeah. What do you mean up to I see a lot of

65
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:07,840
pics of the kids. What's what's going on and all that stuff? Do one of the kids have a birthday

66
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:14,560
this week? No, no, it's my youngest son's graduated from first grade. So he's in now

67
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:20,960
in second grade. Oh, that's great. Wait a minute. But like, it's OK. So the graduation happened

68
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:25,280
this week. They didn't they don't start school or is it like a year round school type of thing?

69
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:30,480
I will. His school's kind of year round, but I mean, honestly, like with the stuff,

70
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:34,800
they're giving him a third grade work anyways as it is. Oh, wow. I guess he's pretty smart. So

71
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:40,880
it's just it's kind of all year round. He's always at that school, so they don't really

72
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:45,600
have a starting end. Let me ask a kind of a weird question, but do you think, you know,

73
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:49,200
because you mentioned like, oh, the kids smart and getting the more advanced work.

74
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:53,440
Do you think the fact that you've kind of taught them about programming and I know you've put them

75
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:57,920
in like the supplemental classes and stuff and well, I don't know if that's it's both your kids

76
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:04,400
you put in those like Code Ninja classes, right? No, just my oldest son right now.

77
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:09,200
OK, but but still like there I know they've got to be learning stuff from you and a lot of the

78
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:14,080
stuff like with Minecraft and all that. Do you think I just because I think about like how we

79
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:18,320
when we were growing up, video games would give you such a bad rap, right? Like only like,

80
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:23,200
you know, nerds and deviants played video games and all this stuff. But I think I feel like we're

81
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:28,000
in a world now where video games are super educational. And I don't I don't just mean I

82
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,320
don't mean like number munchers. We're in the world is Carmen Sandiego. Don't get me wrong.

83
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:36,400
Those games are phenomenal and a part of our upbringing. But I mean, things like, for example,

84
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:42,880
this week, big release game builder garage comes out, right? Huge target on teaching kids. I don't

85
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:49,120
think anybody's going to make the next big video game in game builder garage. But it's a nice

86
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:55,520
little playroom to learn about logic gating and law. And I think that's a huge skill to teach kids

87
00:06:55,520 --> 00:07:04,640
like if then or and like every industry touches logic, even the work I do, I have to use logic a

88
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:11,200
lot in my presentation. I work in tech. Exactly. It's all over. So I so that's my very long window

89
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:18,640
way of asking, do you think the games helped the kid? Yeah, I guess I don't really see him do that

90
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:23,760
a lot because he's been playing Roblox all the time. But OK, but that's another example in a

91
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:30,320
way. And actually to that, he's actually going to be doing a so they have the code ninjas like

92
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:35,440
regular stuff. And then he's got a they have this summer camps that they run. So they have different

93
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:41,120
specialized things. And so he's actually doing a Roblox one in like a week here. So he'll be

94
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:45,440
learning how to make stuff for that. So I think that'll be a little bit better. But yeah, he's

95
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:53,920
already moving on to the next belt here pretty soon, which I think they switched to Lua instead

96
00:07:53,920 --> 00:08:03,280
of JavaScript. I don't know. That's what it is right now. But yeah, I mean, I don't know. He's

97
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:09,360
not he does it on the side, like independently, but he doesn't use like scratch, for example,

98
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:16,160
to make games right now. He's using it to make animations. So, you know, he's having fun with

99
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:22,480
that. But yeah, I'm sure that'll come down, you know, later on, once he kind of gets a bigger

100
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:29,360
idea of like what to do with it. It'll definitely help him. Yeah. Did you pick up on the topic of

101
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:34,560
that? Yeah. Game Builder Garage. I did pick it up. So my youngest son is playing that.

102
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:38,560
And so he showed me like this tag game he made the other day, which I think is just part of the

103
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:44,240
tutorial, but like that you like has a two player game where one person has to try to tag you. And

104
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:49,200
if they tag you hit with something, then you lose or something like that. So it's pretty cool.

105
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:55,760
Yeah, I got to check out the demo for that still. And at some point, I feel like I might get the

106
00:08:55,760 --> 00:09:00,080
full game. I almost want to just get the game to play other people's games like that. That's

107
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:06,080
the best part of Mario Maker to me, honestly. So our little big planet or, you know, we have to

108
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:10,800
pick up dreams, you know, that that's something that dreams has been on a deep cut sale recently,

109
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:15,520
too. Somebody in chat earlier was saying they got it for 999. So that game's Yeah, it's I don't know

110
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:19,520
if that's right now, or if that was a few weeks ago, but I'm sure there's a lot of sales going on

111
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:25,360
this week, for sure. So check that out. Anyway, um, it's a huge week in gaming, right? This is,

112
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:29,040
you know, as Jason was kind of tongue in cheek alluding to in the intro, which I love that.

113
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:34,640
It's, you know, E3 week and this is an interesting year because we're in the middle of E3. Most years

114
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:39,680
I think last year was like this too. But most years, E3 is like a Tuesday, Wednesday,

115
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:43,600
Thursday sort of thing because E3 really is supposed to be a trade show. It's for people

116
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:47,520
that are in the industry. It's for people. It's working, you know, so it's during work time,

117
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:52,240
Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, with Monday being set up and Friday being tear down and travel home

118
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:57,600
and all that good stuff. So having this kind of like right in the middle where we're kind of right

119
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:02,080
in the middle of E3 week when we're doing our show Sunday night is a little interesting and a little

120
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:08,160
different. But obviously it's not just E3 because obviously with everything that's been going on in

121
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:12,640
the world, with all the changes that have been going on in E3, we've seen some other deviations.

122
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:17,120
We've seen indies that are kind of putting together their own thing. And of course we have,

123
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:22,160
I think the first recap we want to get into a little bit, Jeff Keighley's Summer Game Fest,

124
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:28,000
which was the first event, media event. They're not really press conferences anymore. I keep

125
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,400
wanting like my old brain that's been doing the show for 19 years and covering E3 for a long time

126
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:35,120
wants to keep saying press conference, press conference. That's not really what they are now,

127
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:39,440
especially in the age of COVID. They're digital media showcases, basically, or digital media

128
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:45,680
events. So the first big event we had was the Summer Game Fest event on Thursday, right in the

129
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:51,200
middle of the workday. So I unfortunately was not going to be able to watch it, but then get this,

130
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:58,800
our VPN at work went down for like an hour. So I had time to watch it and I didn't do it.

131
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:03,120
I didn't do it. I didn't hack it. Maybe somebody else at work did something. No,

132
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:09,280
it's just, I think just lucky timing, I guess. So I kind of got to watch that a little bit. I mean,

133
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:13,680
I kind of, work came back up partway through, so I had to kind of multitask. But I did get to see

134
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:18,480
it live, which I didn't think I'd originally be able to. Thoughts overall. Let's start.

135
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:22,960
Loki, I know you'll kind of touch on everything, but how was your feeling overall of the Summer

136
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:28,160
Game Fest? Especially because I think that type of announcement was kind of new. I know we had

137
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:32,960
Summer Game Fest last year, but it was like this big four month nebulous thing. And I feel like

138
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:40,400
this was a different type of, it's like Jeff and Friends own digital media event outside of the big

139
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:44,080
ones. And it was interesting. There were some high points for me and some low points for me.

140
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:47,840
But Loki, I'll start with you. What were some of the high points for you and the low points for you?

141
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:53,120
I'm trying to, gosh, like that's the problem with E3 and all these different events is everything

142
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:58,080
starts bleeding into each other. Like I don't remember what was announced there versus what

143
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:04,800
was announced, you know, other places. I mean, was the one from Software Game looks cool,

144
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:11,440
even though it's a game I'm never going to play it. But it looks cool. I'm trying to think if

145
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:17,280
there's anything like really exciting that they announced there that other than that, that I don't

146
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:22,400
know, honestly, like the Xbox stuff, like some of these smaller indie games look really, really

147
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:27,760
good. Like I'm trying to think of some of the examples here, but like there is like some like

148
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:34,880
2D looking games that they have that just absolutely just gorgeous. Yeah. But I think

149
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:39,360
those are more interesting than some of these bigger games almost. Well, let's talk about the

150
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:44,160
big ones. So the grand finale at the end of the whole thing was Elden Ring. I'm not sure

151
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:47,840
personally how I kind of feel about this game. Like I understand there's a lot of people very

152
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:53,280
hyped for this game, but I'm also, I'm not big on Game of Thrones like a lot of people. Sorry. I

153
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:58,240
just, you know, I play so many games. I've fallen behind on my TV. So I never really got into that.

154
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:04,160
So the George R.R. Martin thing. Yeah. Evil Dead. That was something that looked pretty cool.

155
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:10,800
Okay. I like Evil Dead. But Elden Ring. So there's, you know, the trailer and I'm just,

156
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:15,040
I'm not super into the Souls game, but then I think about my husband, Alan, he loves Dark

157
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:20,880
Souls and he's played Dark Souls. He's platinumed Dark Souls. That is, that is a gaming flex right

158
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:25,200
there to have the, well, I'm sorry, the Steam equivalent of platinum, but he has every

159
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:30,080
achievement or whatever. So he's, he's done that on Dark Souls. I think he's done it on Dark Souls

160
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:34,960
too. And I think oddly enough, he hasn't really completed Dark Souls 3. I guess there's something

161
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:39,600
about it that is different or whatever. So I think he might be more into that sort of thing,

162
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:44,640
but I, for me, I'm just kind of like, it looks pretty. I'm like, this is eye candy,

163
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:49,440
like left and right. You know, we're really seeing the potential of the systems, but I otherwise was

164
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:55,440
just kind of like, all right, cool for the people that are into Souls games. Right. Yeah. Yeah.

165
00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:01,120
And I do see some excitement in her chat also. Uh, Ninja the monkey in chat says Elden Ring,

166
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:06,160
finally. Uh, we also have a Quest Buster is reminding, um, also the Elden Ring trailer.

167
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:09,600
I want to get this comment out too, because Bobby says, uh, Bobby Blackwell says,

168
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:14,000
this was the game awards without the awards. Yeah, it absolutely was. It was, uh, you know,

169
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:19,040
just kind of just the announcement part of it. I'll tell you one announcement that surprised me

170
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:24,880
that I was into was the, uh, the first or second one. It was the, uh, tiny Tina borderlands.

171
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:29,440
Yeah, the wonderlands. I was, yeah, that's it. Tiny Tina wonderlands. I was actually kind of

172
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:33,680
into it because, uh, when I saw it was gearbox and 2k and all that. And then there should,

173
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:38,000
at first I was like, okay, Oh God, is this going to be a fart joke game? Like when they,

174
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,200
when they were kind of announcing some of those comment comics in it, I was like,

175
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:45,680
it's going to be a fart joke game, but then Wanda Sykes was one of the comments. And I was like,

176
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:50,400
okay, Wanda Sykes is amazing. And she can tell all the fart jokes she wants. I will,

177
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:57,120
I'll check it out for her. Cause I, I, I, I just love the way she talks. Like I just, I she's like,

178
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:02,800
just hearing her tell a story is hilarious. Her standup albums. And I listened to them

179
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:08,560
every so often. Yeah. No. And, and, and somebody has a delivery. I just know, I know there's been

180
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:13,360
that meme around Facebook. Like who would narrate the book on tape of your life? And I've always

181
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:18,480
said Wanda Sykes because she's so funny and my life's pretty funny. I can see that. Yeah. So,

182
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:27,280
um, so I know who I would want to narrate mine. Who actually it's a streamer. Oh, kill cannon.

183
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:31,200
Okay. Okay. It was just narrate my life. Have you listened to this man's voice?

184
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:35,760
Uh, I, I have, but I'm only a little bit, so I'm like having trouble recalling it

185
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:39,680
in my mind. Oh my God. He's got such a nice voice. I thought you were going to see,

186
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:43,280
I thought you were going to say LC at first and I can definitely hear their voice in my head. You

187
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:50,800
know, got them. I can definitely hear that. We love to see, um, no, I, I went kill cannon to

188
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:56,000
narrate my life just because I would, I would follow sleep to that, to those soothing tones.

189
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:01,360
Uh, low key. Why not? Let's finish the trifecta. Who would narrate your autobiography or whatever,

190
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:09,200
uh, with the book on tape version? Um, Ryan Reynolds. Oh God, that is such the heterosexual

191
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:15,360
answer. I love that. All right. He's snarky. It's the snark that I'm attracted to.

192
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:24,240
You have a little man crush. Well, and he showed up. Okay. Tying it back. He showed up at the

193
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:29,040
summer game fest thing too, with that trailer for the movie. I'm excited about that movie.

194
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:33,680
Actually, I know who else I would choose and that would be Emma Stone, but as Cruella.

195
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:39,040
Oh, okay. Love that. I need to see it. I need to see it. Rob, we should go see it.

196
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:44,160
I think we should. I haven't been to a theater in, since, uh, I don't, I literally don't remember

197
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:48,640
the last time I was in a movie theater. Let's have a friend date. Are we gonna have a friend date?

198
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:53,760
Oh my God. Can we, can we have a friend date and then we're going to get one popcorn and share it

199
00:16:53,760 --> 00:17:00,640
and maybe our hands will awkwardly touch. Let's do it. Okay. All right. Let's do it.

200
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:07,600
Okay. Uh, let's see. Uh, Bobby Black Wolf says, William Shatner. I understand that,

201
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:13,680
but William Shatner is kind of an asshole. Um, and yeah, anyway, I'm going to just tell that

202
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:19,120
story another day. Um, let's see evil, uh, ether VL and chat says Morgan Freeman. Oh,

203
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:24,560
that's a good one too. All right. Morgan Freeman's the one that's like the meme

204
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:30,560
version of that. I will just have corpse husband do it. I love that. Bobby Black Wolf says someone

205
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:35,760
doing William Shatner's voice then. Perfect. Perfect. It's like, it's like, uh, it's not

206
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:41,840
Johnny Depp as, uh, captain Jack Sparrow. It's somebody else doing captain Jack Sparrow.

207
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:47,440
Why not just have, um, Patrick Stewart narrate your life? Oh, that's a good one. That's a good

208
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:54,880
one. Anyway. All right. Look back to the, uh, so tiny Tina's wonderlands. I was into it because

209
00:17:54,880 --> 00:18:00,640
I was like, Oh my God, if they made borderlands a high fantasy game, I'm kind of all about that.

210
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:05,920
That sounds like it'd be a lot of fun. Yeah. So I think that might've been my favorite thing,

211
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:12,080
believe it or not that I saw. I found some games that looked interesting to me, although I am

212
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:18,000
super, super pissed about star Lord, the game house. Oh, the, the one they were talking about

213
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:25,040
today. Yeah. Well, we'll get into that later. Yeah. But I'm also interested in that, um,

214
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:29,440
avatar game. Cause I freaking love the avatar universe. You're jumping way ahead.

215
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:33,600
That's all I'm jumping ahead, but those are what I'm excited about. A lot of people have

216
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:36,560
their feelings. All right. This week we'll get to, we'll get to the avatar thing in the next

217
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:43,040
segment. Um, so, uh, the other announcements. Okay. The death stranding director's cut. What

218
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:47,920
are your, what are your like? Cause, so it was, um, you know, it was totally obvious too. Jeff

219
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:55,040
Keeley is like, I've got a friend here. That's gonna talk to, it's just like, Oh my God. Like

220
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:59,280
you and Hideo Kojima have like such a bromance. Like it's so obvious. Like your crush is so

221
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:05,200
obvious. Jeff. Like, I feel like if I looked at Jeff binder, Jeff's binder, it would say

222
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:12,480
Mr. Jeff Kojima, Mr. Jeff Kojima all over it. Like your crush is so obvious, but there's a box.

223
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:16,560
Yeah. Well, okay. Did you, did you see that trailer? Cause it was pretty funny

224
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:21,680
because at first, you know, I was like, wait a minute, is this a different game in the death

225
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:26,400
stranding engine? Because that was the vibe I got at first and I was like into it. I was like, Oh,

226
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:31,200
they're going to meet. But then it was like, kind of like self parody. It was like Kojima's

227
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:37,040
colliding for the thing. Yeah. Oh no. And then it ended up. Yeah. It was definitely like a special

228
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:41,040
thing for the event. It's like, how much can they really, I mean, I guess they can milk it forever

229
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:48,800
for, um, mill your solid, but I thought it was like VR missions, I guess for, um, death stranding.

230
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:52,800
Yeah. But also how are you going to crawl through an event with all that stuff on your backpack?

231
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:58,720
I mean, that's just physically impossible. You can't be stealthy carrying around like

232
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:05,280
20 stacked packages on your back. Yeah. A 50 foot tall package stack on your back. Um,

233
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:10,000
Questbuster in chat says, I thought the same. I thought he was hinting towards some new expansion

234
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,680
or something for death stranding. That's what I kind of got the vibe at too. I was like, Oh,

235
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:18,720
maybe like an expansion. Like my, my brain went to the final fantasy seven remake and the inner and

236
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:22,640
the integrate and the Yuffie thing that all happened just this week as well. Um, and I

237
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:25,760
thought maybe that's what was happening for death stranding. And I guess when they say director's

238
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:31,040
cut, I would assume that's what it is. Like, wouldn't a director's cut be adding stuff in.

239
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:36,640
Isn't that what a director's cut does? It would be adding things that were intended to be in.

240
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:42,000
Yeah. Yeah. We really just wanted to put mill gear into death stranding completely.

241
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,560
I don't think any of that is actually in the game. I think that was all just a big joke for the

242
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:52,800
reveal, but it's interesting. I did. You know what though? At the end of the day, I, and I, I say,

243
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:59,920
I did love death stranding, even if I didn't beat it, because I think it came out at the re that

244
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:04,800
game's release is so interesting because I think it came out at the right time and the wrong time.

245
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:10,720
I think it came out at the right time because what a, I don't even know the word for it. What

246
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:18,240
a poetic piece, I guess on COVID without exactly. Right. It came out. It just is. I mean,

247
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:24,480
yeah, we had animal crossing as the perfect release, but death stranding also really had

248
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:29,040
that parallel going on and it wasn't even intentional. Right. But then for me, that also

249
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:35,440
made it a bad thing because for me and like, you know, you know, as an extrovert, I've been having

250
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:41,680
a very hard time these last 50 months. So for me, it was almost like too much for me, like mentally.

251
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:47,520
And I was, and for that reason, I was more drawn to the cute little animal friendships and my BFF

252
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:51,040
catch up and all that stuff at animal crossing instead, which I still need to give you your

253
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:56,720
catch up. Yay. All right. Can she come on the date to the movie? Yeah, she can come on the date to

254
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:02,320
the movie. Okay. Yay. Quest Buster in chat says I enjoyed death stranding. It was different and

255
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:07,760
it was kind of fun co-oping and road building with shared resource donations. Also zip line

256
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:13,760
networks for the win. Yeah, absolutely. So I I'll, I'll, I'll check it. I don't have a PS five yet,

257
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:17,440
but I imagine by the time I get one, the director's cut will be down in price a little

258
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:21,600
bit. So I'll probably still check it out. I'll double dip. Why not? I guess I'm the problem.

259
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:26,400
Is it only on PlayStation five? Are they doing like, um, the PC version as well?

260
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:31,840
I guess they didn't say my assumption was a PS five thing, but you ask a good question.

261
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:39,920
It probably is the only piece, but I don't know. PC's a decent guess. Um, did you know your webcam

262
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:45,040
died? Loki. I'm sure Jamie because I'm eating ice cream. It's okay. I'm like, I'm talking to,

263
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:50,000
I'm talking to two dots right now. No, it's all good. It's all good. Sorry. It's my wife got me

264
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:56,960
vampire penguin. So like, you know, it's, uh, it's fine. You can show us ice cream, Loki. It's okay.

265
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:02,240
Okay. See? Yeah, I'm okay with that. All right. Anyway. Uh, what else, what else do we miss from

266
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:06,160
summer game Fest though? If you can take a break between bites to remind me of the things I'm

267
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:10,800
missing. Oh gosh. I'm trying to remember all the different things they announced. Um,

268
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:16,560
lots of Netflix stuff. Like I'm kind of curious. I mean, I don't know, like I'm curious about the,

269
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:21,520
the blood dragon inspired thing. Although what they showed, like,

270
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:26,400
doesn't resemble blood dragon, like blood dragons, like just very tongue in cheek,

271
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:32,880
you know, spoof of all eighties actions stuff with like a ton of like neon synthwave stuff.

272
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:39,280
And the guy that's doing it, I like his fan films that he puts out the unofficial,

273
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:44,960
like bootleg films or whatever. Um, I just don't see it. I mean, it looks like a pretty

274
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:50,080
cool animated thing, but like, it's just not, it's not blood dragon. I don't know.

275
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:54,640
Okay. I have, I'll check it out. I have a list of a few things to remind myself, um,

276
00:23:54,640 --> 00:24:00,560
of what was announced at the summer game Fest. Um, uh, a near automatic crossover with fall guys

277
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:04,640
and that to be costume for fall guys. That was kind of funny. I thought of act deaf because I

278
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:10,800
know he's a fan of that game. Um, the two point campus. So that's one of those SIM games. That's

279
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:16,000
that whole SIM universe that a two point hospital. Yeah, exactly. So two point campus. And that

280
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:20,640
looked a little batshit crazy, but I also know that like, I know dark soccer loves those SIM

281
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:24,000
type games. So I kind of was like, oh, maybe that'd be something that she's into. Well,

282
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:28,000
not to say I'm not into him. I might check it out. Um, it just looked a little batshit crazy

283
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,360
to me, like almost like there was too much going on in that game. You know,

284
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:36,560
but I think that's the appeal of that series is that they're a little bit, uh, tongue in cheek,

285
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:41,920
so to speak. Yeah. You couldn't do your, was it your magicians campus or something like that?

286
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:48,720
Interesting. Um, the also, I thought this was a very strange time to announce this whole, like,

287
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:53,680
we've got a new gaming label and that was a big thing they got into there was that there was,

288
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:58,240
uh, that prime matter where payday three Kings bounty two, the new painkiller game.

289
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:01,760
So they kind of had a bunch of like rapid fire stuff in there. Um, that was interesting that

290
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:05,440
they use that opportunity to say we're launching a new label. I thought that was a little weird,

291
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:11,200
but I mean, not like bad weird, but just like, just kind of weird, weird. So anyway. Um, and

292
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:18,240
then there were some other ones too. There's, um, uh, Jurassic world evolution too. They

293
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:22,160
have played the first one, but it looked interesting. I don't know. Maybe I'd be

294
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:28,320
more interested when the movie comes up. Sorry. Alan is texting me from target. My favorite place

295
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:34,160
and like, uh, do you want this? Do you want this? Um, okay. Um, yeah, I, I forgot. Okay.

296
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:38,880
Here's the thing. I forgot there was even a drastic world evolution one until, and then

297
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:42,320
when they played that trailer, I was like, Ooh, this looks really pretty. What is this? And then

298
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:46,400
they were like, it's evolution too. And I was like, Oh yeah, I forgot that that was a thing.

299
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:51,520
So maybe that's a series I need to check out. I don't know. Um, and then there was one more

300
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:55,120
and I was hoping Dar Sakura would be back for this, but, um, that's all right. I can ask her

301
00:25:55,120 --> 00:26:00,800
later, but there was that metal slug tactics game that was kind of interesting. Yeah. It's

302
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:05,280
kind of our left field there, but it looked interesting. Yeah, for sure. So I thought that

303
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:10,160
was a little bit weird that that, um, showed up. I also, I think the tactics thing has been a mobile

304
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:17,920
game before, but like all I wanted though from that is like very, they had this anime intro type

305
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:24,240
thing to it. I'm like, I want a metal slug anime now. Not necessarily like, uh, the tactics game

306
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:31,120
is fine, but it's like, I'll take the anime, please. Um, can that come to Netflix? So,

307
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:37,680
yeah. So overall I thought the summer game Fest thing, it was fine. There were some decent

308
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:45,120
announcements, but I did think it ran a little long for what they had in it. Um, there were some

309
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:49,200
nice, like, you know, they had like the Weezer thing and the, actually that first musical

310
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:53,680
performance was the best one. And I, I'm so sorry, I forgot her name or the game that it was

311
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:57,520
promoting, which is terrible. But all I remember is that I really liked that performance that was

312
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:02,080
better than the Weezer thing to me. Um, somebody in chat, please help me out here. Um, but if you

313
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:07,280
want to talk about music to stream, that was really cute. I have that weird tie-in with that boat,

314
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:12,480
like gateboarding game. Well, that game looked cute for sure. Yeah, it's cute. It's just like,

315
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:18,880
like, this is so random that this is tied in with the game, but okay. Yeah. Yeah. Um, gosh,

316
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:22,080
now it's bugging me. I can't remember the name of the artist, like butterfly something, butterfly

317
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:26,880
garden. I can't remember. Shucks. Uh, hopefully somebody in chat will help me out here in a

318
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:32,800
moment. Um, but yeah, that was the, uh, the musical performance I liked. Thank you. Okay. Wow. I

319
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:37,040
messed up the name completely. Mike Deff said it was Japanese breakfast. Where the hell did I get

320
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:42,480
butterfly garden from? Was that the name of the song maybe? Or am I just, am I just at the point

321
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:47,120
where I'm just straight up making shit up? All right. Butterflies and gardens. Apparently,

322
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:50,880
apparently I'm thinking of a nice, so Japanese breakfast was the name of the artist. That does

323
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:55,840
sound right now that you're saying that. So, um, that was, uh, that was great. All right. Um,

324
00:27:55,840 --> 00:28:01,680
let's move on. Let's talk about the next, uh, uh, media event, which was Ubisoft's event.

325
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:06,320
So the Ubisoft forward event happened. Um, I actually don't think any of us were able

326
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:10,800
to catch it live. We only caught kind of the headlines, but let me kick it back over to dark

327
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:15,120
soccer because you had brought up the avatar game. Um, and I know this was a big thing that

328
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:20,800
Ubisoft announced. And a lot of the reaction I saw online to this was, well, this game's about

329
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:26,240
10 years too late, but I don't think so. I don't think so either. Cause if you've got those sequel

330
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:31,280
at like, wasn't the first sequel supposed to be this year, but then COVID. Yeah. I think

331
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:36,720
the new avatar movie is coming out. Yeah. So, so this is perfectly right. I think that people have

332
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:41,760
allowed themselves to forget. Yeah. I think you're right. But our soccer, I know you were a big fan

333
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:44,880
of the movie and the lore and all that stuff. What, what do you, what did you think about

334
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:49,520
hearing about this new game? Um, I would have liked to have seen more about it,

335
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:56,880
but it looks really pretty and I'm interested in this snow drop engine. Um, uh, I think that

336
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:00,320
it would, you know, once I see a little bit more about it, you know, depending on like

337
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:06,720
character customization, what the story's going to be, it just still makes me think I would like a,

338
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:13,440
um, uh, an MMO in that universe. I would play an MMO in that universe in a heartbeat.

339
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:19,760
And I think it's also, it's an avatar game is also a good, um, chance to kind of reintroduce

340
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:24,640
avatar to, uh, the world. Cause it has been a little while since that first movie.

341
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:29,520
And I think there's a lot of pressure on those sequels to perform very well because that first,

342
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:34,240
you know, movie is like the biggest motion picture of all time, if I'm not mistaken, right? Yeah.

343
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:38,880
So, I mean, absolutely. So there's a lot of pressure on those sequels to do very well.

344
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:42,960
And so I think in order to help that they kind of need to bring avatar back into

345
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:48,160
that pop culture consciousness, if that makes sense. Um, totally. That's what they need to do.

346
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:53,200
And the, um, Disney stuff at Orlando is a part of that too, right? Cause they just opened the

347
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:57,360
Pandora thing at is the animal kingdom or one of those parks down there. They opened the whole

348
00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:02,400
Pandora's world there and that's a big deal. Uh, apparently it's really well done. Yeah. So.

349
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:08,400
It's I just, I was watching the trailer and I've watched it a couple of times. It just seems

350
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:14,800
really like that was one of the few things that really grabbed me out of the stuff I was able to

351
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:21,200
see. Um, going into chat, a Zen monkey says avatar got beat by infinity war end game. I think did it.

352
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:25,440
I thought they did a rerelease of avatar that put it, but I could be wrong. I don't, but

353
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:31,200
either way shenanigans at one point, but I think they re-released it in theaters again. So that's

354
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:37,040
why it's like, it's back all that stuff aside. It still doesn't negate the point that those

355
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:42,000
sequels are under tremendous pressure to do well because the first movie did so well. Um,

356
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,680
see a Tiberian chat says they could always cancel sequels like they did divergent. Well,

357
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:48,640
they're not going to do that because they've already filmed at least two of them, right?

358
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:52,960
Like isn't a James Cameron filming like four of them, like back to back to back,

359
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:58,400
like not taking a break. Yeah. It's, it's seems like it's a lot like when we get a sequel,

360
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:01,840
we're getting sequels. There's going to be a whole Cameron. So, you know,

361
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:08,800
he's going to go through it anyway. Yeah, for sure. Um, so yeah. Uh, crystal, uh, crystal,

362
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:14,480
why can't I talk today? Crystal skies in chat says, yeah, two of them are already filmed.

363
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:18,080
I thought that's what I'd heard too. Cause I, I remember there was talk about Sigourney Weaver

364
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:22,080
being in them and all that, which made me go, didn't well, you know, I don't, I don't want,

365
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:27,120
but you know, everyone lives through the tree. How is she in it? Okay. So, Oh, wow. They have

366
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:32,320
an entire city built in New Zealand. Well, that's the place to film it. I'm sure that's going to be

367
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:36,880
interesting. So anyway. Um, so, okay. Yeah. So the game is happening and I'm sure the game is going

368
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:42,880
to be, um, um, uh, pretty, pretty big undertaking as well. Um, let's see, what else did we miss at

369
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:49,200
the Ubisoft event? Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah. So that whole thing's getting a sequel, which is, uh,

370
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:55,440
pretty exciting. What do you think about that? It looks deep. I played a little bit of the first

371
00:31:55,440 --> 00:32:00,560
one. I know my kids played more of it, but yeah, it looks cool. Um, I just, I like how Nintendo

372
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:05,920
leaked that. Yeah. Uh, it just came to my mind, of course, my, my music game roots are very excited

373
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:10,960
to hear about this, that rock Smith is making a comeback. Um, so, but it's, it's this whole rock

374
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:16,080
Smith port for a while though they did, but now there's a whole new thing coming out. There's this

375
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:20,720
rock Smith plus that's coming out. Um, that is going to help you learn how to play guitar. And

376
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:24,800
I think they're actually like teaming up with like guitar schools and this whole thing. And there's

377
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:29,760
like a special guitar and all this stuff. So, uh, it's kind of neat to see that that series is still

378
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:35,280
going on. Yeah. Uh, there's going to be a mobile app and a workshop in the game. So it's like,

379
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:41,120
Hey, please buy more stuff for us. Yeah. Real time feedback. That's, that's pretty cool. How like,

380
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:45,120
you know, the whole like learning through a game thing is really going to the next level. That's

381
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:52,640
for sure. Wasn't that what Exeter was doing for a bit? Um, you, you, well, he was playing that

382
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:58,960
game a lot. Yes. He was trying to learn how to play through it. Absolutely. So, um, let's see

383
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:03,120
some other things that they taught. They talked a lot about rainbow six, um, which I know is a

384
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:07,360
huge series, just not one that I am super into, but I know they spend a lot of time on that.

385
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:12,960
They're getting cross play, uh, cross progression with PC. You know, there's a new Just Dance game.

386
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:18,320
Who's excited about that? That's coming out too. Of course they had to do that. Uh, a new kind of

387
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:23,440
like expansion for Assassin's Creed Valhalla, which is, um, good that I don't, I think it's

388
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:27,280
good. They're not doing a whole nother Assassin's Creed game, but they're doing an expansion. I

389
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:32,080
think is a good way to do it. Um, so that's pretty cool. Uh, and then they were talking about fire

390
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:38,640
cry six a little bit as well. So, uh, and, uh, also what was not there, the Prince of Persia

391
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:43,600
Sansa time remake, they bumped it all the way to 2022. Now that thing has been delayed a couple

392
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:49,280
times now, and now they bumped it all the way to 2022. They did not show it. So interesting.

393
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:53,360
It's going to just see if it's actually going to happen. I think it will, but I think it's

394
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:58,560
just having problems. And in all fairness, it's probably COVID related and the difficulties of

395
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:03,920
developing from home and being able to squash the bugs that way. It's probably, uh, uh, you know,

396
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:10,400
not, not doing too well. So they have to take a little extra time. Um, Loki, I know you love

397
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:15,520
these guys that are up next on our agenda, the devolver digital presentation. Did you check this

398
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:24,400
one out? I did skim through it. Yeah. Um, they have like, was it the, um, shadow warrior three

399
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:30,240
looks just nuts. I thought originally when I was looking at that, that it was a new serious Sam

400
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:37,120
game, but yeah, it just looks absolutely crazy. So there's that, um, gosh, I'm trying to think

401
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:45,040
of the atomic, what was the, there was another game, but I can't remember once again, I watched

402
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:52,960
the Xbox and I watched the developer digital all like back to back. Um, gosh, I can't remember

403
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:57,040
what other game they had there that was like really amazing, but there was like a bunch of

404
00:34:57,040 --> 00:35:01,680
like crazy stuff. I mean, it's always crazy. And then of course, you know, the, the gimmicks that

405
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:06,160
they do where they're selling like a thousand dollar VHS tape or something like that. Um,

406
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:12,080
always funny. I like this stuff. Yeah, I guess they had a whole like monetization as they're

407
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:16,560
kind of riffing on the whole like monetization type of thing. Um, so the games they announced,

408
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:21,680
Loki, maybe one of these old joggy memory, uh, track to Yomi was one of the games.

409
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:26,880
Um, yeah, that looked interesting. Yeah. Uh, wizard with a gun. I liked, I liked that based

410
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:31,120
on title alone. That's by the, that's by the folks. I want to, I mean, I can't remember.

411
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:36,400
I know it wasn't like they, I thought it was another gun game based on the,

412
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:40,480
the little animated trailer thing that they had at first, but yeah, it's not,

413
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:46,960
but that looked interesting. It kind of had a don't starve vibe to it. Uh, this game sounds

414
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:53,920
super interesting to me. Inscription, which is a, uh, rogue like, but a deck builder with escape

415
00:35:53,920 --> 00:36:00,000
room style puzzles and psychological horror. I'm like, wow, way complicated way to take a

416
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,680
lot of random shit that I'm into and like throw it all in the same game. I'm, I'm cool with it.

417
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:09,600
I'm into it. Why not? Um, let's see. And then, uh, devolver tumble time. Is that actually the

418
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:14,320
name of the game? I think it is. I thought that was just a parody that he had in there,

419
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:18,880
but yeah, no, it's a, it's a, it's a legit mobile game that's coming out. iOS and Android,

420
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:28,560
uh, demon throttle, uh, is one, uh, death's door, uh, phantom abyss and then shadow warrior three.

421
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:32,560
And that's everything that I see on my list. Demon throttle look cool. Um, but yeah,

422
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:40,720
shadow warrior three is just insane looking. All right. Um, cool. So, uh, that was pretty much what

423
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:44,000
was going on with devolver. Admittedly, I didn't catch it just because there was a lot of other

424
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:48,240
stuff going on this weekend. Uh, I couldn't sit in front of press conferences all weekend long,

425
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:51,520
but I knew I could catch, uh, some of the wrap ups later on, which it sounds like,

426
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:53,680
look, you kind of did you binge watch everything today, right?

427
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:59,200
I just tried to get as much of it in there as I could. Yeah. Yeah. So I'm just, I'm,

428
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:06,320
I don't always do this, but I have to, so I just got a text message from my dad and he says he's

429
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:10,080
watching on the iPad right now, which I don't know if I've ever gotten a text like that,

430
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:14,640
that he's actually watching the show live as it's going on. So, um, can you all in chat show

431
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:19,200
a little love to my dad who's, uh, watching, especially with father's day coming up next week.

432
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:23,040
Uh, I think it's pretty rad that he's watching right now. So, um, give him some shout outs

433
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:27,360
and chat and hello, hello. And, uh, sorry, I'm not texting you back, but I'm a little busy right now,

434
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:36,560
but there you go. All right. Dad, father's day is actually pretty sad for me. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

435
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:41,200
I know. I know it's, uh, yeah. Well, and, and, you know, mother's day for me is rough too. So,

436
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:46,880
um, yeah. So, um, but, uh, dad, dad chapped a little, tapped a little button that shows you

437
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:52,160
chat if you don't already see it. Cause there's a lot of love in there. Okay. Anyway. Um, let's

438
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:57,760
move on. Uh, let's talk about one that I definitely watched. Cause I was, uh, watching this event live,

439
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:04,080
um, watching it. What's that? I say where you hate watching it. No, I wasn't the Microsoft event.

440
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:09,440
I wasn't hate watching that was great. No. And I w I wasn't intending on hate watching that,

441
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:15,840
but we'll get to that. So the Microsoft event. So Bobby and I were doing co-stream much. God,

442
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:21,120
there was a lot. Well, what do you think? Yeah. Overall, what did you think of Microsoft? Cause

443
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:26,960
I kind of, I thought it was a tepid reaction on Twitter, but I wasn't, I thought it was excellent.

444
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:32,720
I thought they did a great job. Yeah. I was a little shocked. It was only an hour and 15

445
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:37,520
minutes. But, um, when you consider it, like what I really loved about it. And, uh, when Bobby and

446
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:43,600
I were talking, he really kind of, uh, uh, phrased this a really good way too, is that, um, you have,

447
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:47,840
you have the beginning and, uh, you know, they're, they're saying Microsoft saying, this is what we're

448
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:51,760
going to show you. And then they show it to you. And then at the end, they say, this is what we've

449
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:56,640
shown you. Like, here's the, here's the receipts. And they really did. They showed what, 30 games,

450
00:38:56,640 --> 00:39:03,120
27 of them coming to game pass. And once again, I'm sitting here going, this is the greatest

451
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:09,120
game pass commercial that Microsoft is doing with this event. Like there was so much good stuff

452
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:13,840
where it was like, get it on game pass, get it on game pass. I mean, we're talking about new stuff,

453
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:21,360
like the halo game. And we're talking about things like Hades, right? Uh, an amazing game from last

454
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:26,640
year that is also going to be coming to game pass. Um, and I think one of the other big shocks

455
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:31,440
for a game that's coming to game pass is that I had done Chronicles, which, you know, don't call

456
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:38,560
it Suey Coden, but wink, right? There's, there's that whole thing. And that was, that was crowdfunded.

457
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:45,280
So it was a little shocking to hear that Microsoft kind of paid to get it on game pass, but the, um,

458
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:50,480
the creators immediately were doing, if you want to call it damage control, I don't know what you'd

459
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:53,760
call it because I don't think everybody feels burned by this, but you know, there's going to be

460
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:58,080
some anti Xbox people out there that are like, why is this on game pass? I didn't back this game for

461
00:39:58,080 --> 00:40:02,080
to be on game. Cause you know, there's always, somebody's going to complain, but they sent out

462
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:06,400
an email almost immediately to backers and disclosure. I am, I was a backer of the game

463
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:13,280
that says, um, it's coming out. Uh, there's going to be a third DLC that this Microsoft deal has

464
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:17,600
completely funded now, in addition to the two, we promised you, and this will be free to all

465
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:22,480
the backers. So it's like, you're, you're going to get more of this game because of this deal.

466
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:27,440
I think it's going to hate on that though, but there's haters going to hate haters going to hate

467
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:33,920
exactly. Exactly. Right. Yeah. And crystal skies 80 and chat says it gets me free deals DLC. So

468
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:38,720
I'm good. And I think that's an important consider that perspective. They're not taking anything

469
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:45,360
away. They're adding to, and this is this, this, this happens a lot in gaming on a lot of

470
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:51,040
different topics. People get mad, but they're not taking away. They're adding to. So it's going to

471
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:54,880
be fine. They're not suddenly taken away the PlayStation version or the switch version.

472
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:59,200
It's just that it's also going to be on game pass, but that's still a huge land for game pass.

473
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:04,480
And in my opinion, a very smart move on Microsoft's part, because what is their biggest,

474
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:12,000
weakest spot right now at Microsoft Japanese developed games and especially exclusive ones,

475
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:16,240
they have a huge weak spot there and everybody knows that's Microsoft's blind spot. And they,

476
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:22,240
they have a really hard time with that is the Japanese develop. So they, they gave this game

477
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:26,800
a lot of money and now that's a huge asset in Microsoft's pocket. I think it's a very smart

478
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:33,680
deal. Good for them. So, all right. Let's see what else do we want to talk about from the Microsoft

479
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:39,200
of that? I know the big one I have to talk about y'all. Cause it was like this unless Nintendo

480
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:44,080
really blows it out of the water on Tuesday, which I'm managing my expectations.

481
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:49,120
I don't see how anything beats Forza Horizon 5. That blew my fucking mind. That trailer was

482
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:56,160
amazing. Um, and what is gorgeous, um, love the fact that they set it in Mexico.

483
00:41:57,120 --> 00:42:03,440
And I think it's important to note. I love that the game is trying to shatter a lot of

484
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:09,840
perceptions of Mexico because let's be real. A lot of folks in the U S have a certain perception

485
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:16,480
of Mexico based on the news and the media and that whole thing. Right. And I love the fact that

486
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:22,560
through a video game, they're going to really challenge our perception perceptions of that

487
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:28,480
and really show a lot of, you know, all these diverse things, uh, from an entire country.

488
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:32,160
And I think they really drove the point home when they were like, look how you can get out

489
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:37,280
of your car and take a picture of this mural that was actually developed by a Mexican artist.

490
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:42,560
And as a Diego, I do not remember the artist's name in the moment. I'm sorry. I was absorbing

491
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:49,040
a lot of information, but it was one of the mural, the most, uh, famous, uh, mural creators and

492
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:56,080
painters of Mexico is also married. Uh, uh, his name was Diego Rivera. He was married to, uh,

493
00:42:56,080 --> 00:43:01,200
Frida Kahlo. Ah, okay. Okay. And they cheated on each other a lot, but that's art history.

494
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:05,760
That's art history. But even, you know, and so, so even next to all that, the game just

495
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:10,960
looked beautiful. My God. Like I, I, I went back and looked at the, the thing that Bobby and I was

496
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:17,040
doing, my jaw was on the floor watching the graphics. It was so good. Um, so yeah. Uh,

497
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:23,600
Mike Deft is confirming it was not Diego Rivera. Yeah. I didn't see all of it yet. So yeah,

498
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:27,520
just saw a little bit of the trailer. Check out the footage for the game. It looks amazing.

499
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:33,200
Look at a mural. I'd look at Diego. What I also thought was kind of novel about

500
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:38,640
Forza and, uh, Forza Horizon and the fact that it was showing up at Microsoft's conference.

501
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:45,840
That's the game they dedicated the most time to not halo, not battlefield. They dedicated the most

502
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:52,000
time to Forza Horizon five. And like, I, I, I, I, on one hand, I get it because those Forza games

503
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:56,480
are always incredibly critically well-received and I'm sure this game is going to be no different.

504
00:43:56,480 --> 00:44:02,400
Um, obviously it's huge. Yeah. And showing up like now you're getting to watch it in 4k even.

505
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:06,640
And when it was being streamed live, it wasn't in 4k. And I bet it's even more gorgeous in 4k.

506
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:12,080
I got to go back and watch it again. Um, but, uh, just the fact that that was the tent pole

507
00:44:12,080 --> 00:44:17,120
made me so happy because that was what really finally converted me over to the Xbox camp was

508
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:22,400
really playing Forza Horizon was like a huge, you know, I was like, there just isn't a racing game

509
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:28,640
like this. This is huge. So, and crystal skies in chat points out Forza Horizon still has a massive

510
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:33,840
dedicated fan base. And by the way, shout out you guys, I, since we're recording a podcast,

511
00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:38,080
you know what, but you guys have a hype train going in chat and I just, I just want to say

512
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:42,480
thank you. I'm sorry. You know, since we're recording this show, I don't like to do the

513
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:45,840
usual Twitch thing of, of doing all the shout outs in the middle of the show, cause it kind

514
00:44:45,840 --> 00:44:51,680
of disrupts the flow of the podcast, but I just, your generosity is so kind. So thank you guys so

515
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:55,120
much. I really appreciate all of you. Thank you for being here on Sunday night. I appreciate it.

516
00:44:55,760 --> 00:45:02,480
Um, Mike, I really like this mural. Oh yeah. Mike Defton chat called out. It is a Farid Rueda. I

517
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:05,840
hope I said that name right. Uh, who did that mural? Yeah. It's a cool mirror. It looks like

518
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:09,520
something you'd see on a, uh, like in the wide open walls downtown, doesn't it? Especially

519
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:14,880
because it's a bear in California is really big on bears. It makes me think of some of the murals

520
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:21,920
I've seen in parts of, uh, Oakland. Yeah. Yeah. So anyway, yeah, that stole the whole damn show

521
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:28,880
to me was that Forza Horizon, but right before Forza Horizon came up was that Microsoft flight

522
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:38,800
simulator on Xbox and who that was gorgeous. I mean that we, it's, it's, we already know that

523
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:42,400
game is gorgeous. Like, you know, it's already been out on PC and it's kind of like, if you,

524
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:45,600
if you watch people stream that game, you've played it yourself. It's like, we, we've been

525
00:45:45,600 --> 00:45:51,040
new. We knew that game was gorgeous, but to see it on the series X, you know, a platform that's

526
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:56,960
really optimized for gaming and to just look, I mean, Oh my God, dark soccer, bring up that

527
00:45:56,960 --> 00:46:02,560
trailer too, because never in my life, 20 years ago, I would have never thought like I'm into

528
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:10,400
flight Sims, but like, I actually had been watching that one and you want to know, honestly,

529
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:15,040
the first thing that popped into my head and you're going to laugh your ass off about this

530
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:21,280
is I was thinking of a Soren from Disneyland. Oh, Oh my God. Kinda. You do kind of get that

531
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:25,920
vibe from a trailer like that, right? I totally got that vibe down to the music and everything,

532
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:32,080
but it is really, it is really pretty. Um, all the various different kinds of planes now I probably,

533
00:46:32,080 --> 00:46:38,720
well, there's a Top Gun reference of course. Um, I mean, I probably wouldn't play it,

534
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:44,720
but I would watch people play it. Does that make sense? Yeah. Well, yes, especially how you've,

535
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:50,400
you've turned into quite the Twitch person this past three months, ever since you discovered

536
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:55,600
the Dead by Daylight community. And it's like queer people playing horror games, my home,

537
00:46:56,800 --> 00:47:02,240
right? Am I wrong? Well, no, I was just like, well, honestly, like what got me

538
00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:11,280
into that was, um, my friend, uh, sweet Nika. And then I discovered the rest of the community

539
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:16,720
around it and I'm like, Ooh, I like these people and I like this game and I suck at it,

540
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:24,480
but I'm getting better. And yeah. So anyway, um, anyway, um, yes. So you brought up the Top Gun

541
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:28,800
thing that was actually, um, there's, it's like, it looks like a free exp, no, maybe not free. I

542
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:34,240
don't know, but it's free. Oh shit. So like a free expansion to flight simulator that they're

543
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:40,480
actually, you can fly the fricking planes from Top Gun and all that. So I tie in with the new movie.

544
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:45,760
Oh yeah. For sure. For sure. But it's, it's still, it's like how it went in F 15 Tomcat.

545
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:51,760
Yeah. How completely unnecessary, but awesome. Right. As long as, as long as we get like the

546
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:57,040
Top Gun soundtrack in there as well. Yes. That remix was great. Bobby, like the minute Bobby

547
00:47:57,040 --> 00:48:02,560
heard that bong that starts right there. He's like, it's Top Gun. Holy shit. It's Top Gun.

548
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:09,280
Yeah. Right now we just need like Kenny Loggins on the soundtrack.

549
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:17,440
Um, but no, for me, all I need, just the thing I do not want, please do not have the refueling

550
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:22,800
plane in flight simulator. No, no, no, no. And if you don't know what I'm talking about,

551
00:48:23,360 --> 00:48:29,120
go back to the NES Top Gun game, which was amazing. Like for back in the day on the NES,

552
00:48:29,120 --> 00:48:35,600
the Top Gun game was the shit. That game was awesome. The only thing cooler than the Top Gun

553
00:48:35,600 --> 00:48:42,880
video game was the Top Gun ride at Six Flags Great America in the Bay Area. Yeah. But Rob,

554
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:48,560
it honestly, okay. I'm going to, I'm going to admit something to you. Okay. I had the

555
00:48:48,640 --> 00:49:00,240
how to win at video games, VHS tape, and it had how to do the refuel thing perfectly every time.

556
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:07,040
Wow. I could never get it. I could never get it. Once you have like the pitch and everything,

557
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:13,680
it actually isn't that hard to get your plane there. If you do the same one every time.

558
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:19,040
It's just interesting. But honestly though, After Burner was better.

559
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:26,720
Always saying it. A Sega fan till the very end. A Sega fan till the very end. No, keep in mind,

560
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:34,080
I grew up with Nintendo and Super Nintendo. Dan's the Sega guy. I know. But stepping back now,

561
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:41,360
I can say this, After Burner is a better game because no refueling and it's a lot more fast

562
00:49:41,360 --> 00:49:46,880
paced. The Top Gun was no slouch. All right. It was no slouch. No. All right.

563
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:50,720
After Burner had better music. But the two, I got to say, aside from those though,

564
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:54,160
there was some other smaller stuff that looked pretty awesome. Like Replace,

565
00:49:55,120 --> 00:50:00,880
that pixel art kind of like, I don't even know. It just looks amazing. Just the artwork in that

566
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:07,600
is such amazing work. I need to try it. And then Atomic Heart, which kind of looked like a

567
00:50:07,600 --> 00:50:14,160
Soviet version of Fallout, looked just crazy. So I'm gonna check those out.

568
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:18,080
I just have to shout out the chatters one more time because that hype train got all the way to

569
00:50:18,080 --> 00:50:23,920
level five. They beat the final boss of the hype train. There's no more levels to the hype train.

570
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:28,880
They got it all the way. They defeated the hype train much like Final Fantasy VI.

571
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:34,560
They suplexed that hype train. Absolutely. Thank you guys so much. Thank you to all of

572
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:38,640
you who participated with that. Thank you. Thank you. Another game that just is really

573
00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:43,040
pretty to me, although I don't know if I'm going to play it though, is Out of Worlds.

574
00:50:44,320 --> 00:50:49,440
You must watch the trailer. The narration. Okay. The narration. Well, listen to it too,

575
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:54,640
because the narration is funny as hell. But yes, it looks good too. I thought it was Fable at first

576
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:59,440
until there was Space Aliens. I was like, wait, this can't be Fable. What if they did like

577
00:51:00,080 --> 00:51:06,480
Fable alien version? I'd be into it, but they need to give us Fable the regular version first,

578
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:13,840
which we haven't seen yet. We need more Fable. You should really play Out of Worlds. I hear it's

579
00:51:13,840 --> 00:51:18,080
really good. Oh, I played a little bit of it and it is really fun. And it's just one of those again,

580
00:51:18,080 --> 00:51:22,320
you know, then I got distracted by something shiny and didn't go back and finish it,

581
00:51:22,320 --> 00:51:26,640
but I need to. I really do. Let's talk about some of the other announcements of the Microsoft

582
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:31,600
Bethesda event. I think a big one we have to mention. Starfield. So we kind of got the first

583
00:51:31,600 --> 00:51:37,520
look at Starfield, although they didn't really show the game. So I still am not really like,

584
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:43,840
okay, it's space. We knew that. But I will say like, not to sound like low on it, because when

585
00:51:43,840 --> 00:51:49,440
I was watching the trailer, I was like, the level of graphical detail in this game is amazing.

586
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:54,480
You know, there was really paying attention to detail. And maybe that's why this game is taking

587
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:58,640
so fucking long, which is fine, is that they're paying such attention to detail. But we did

588
00:51:58,640 --> 00:52:02,960
finally get the date. It's going to be 11-11-22, which is cute, because that's, you know, what,

589
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:08,880
11 years after Skyrim, right? So it's going to be then. And they did confirm, they put an end to

590
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:15,200
this whole, are they or are they? It is Xbox exclusive. So none for you, PlayStation, which,

591
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:21,520
you know, is an expected move on Microsoft's part. They got to do it to kind of counter

592
00:52:22,320 --> 00:52:27,280
the Horizon Zero Dawns and the, you know, God of Wars of the world. They had to do something

593
00:52:27,840 --> 00:52:31,600
of their own. But unfortunately, we didn't really get to see gameplay. And so I'm like,

594
00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:37,760
is it Skyrim in space? Is it? What is it? So unfortunately, that part was still kind of

595
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:42,240
missing for me. But hopefully we'll see more. At least we know, okay, we got about a year and a

596
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:46,880
half to go. So we'll probably see way more about it at the next E3, that's for sure.

597
00:52:47,600 --> 00:52:49,360
So it's no man's mass effect.

598
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:54,560
Hey, you know, I love this. You know, I love the space games. So that's why I'm already,

599
00:52:54,560 --> 00:53:01,600
you know, yeah, you joke, but that that game already has me on it. Exactly. Let's see some

600
00:53:01,600 --> 00:53:06,800
of the other things to mention. So they closed with an interesting game. Let's talk about the

601
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:12,960
actual closing of it because I saw some comments in chat. So they closed with a game called Redfall

602
00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:20,560
that was a like co op open world game, if I remember right. And it looks a lot like a

603
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:25,440
zombie Left 4 Dead type of thing, except it's not zombies. It's vampires.

604
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:33,520
So it's a vampire shooter game. Now, here's the thing. I liked it. I liked that it was a,

605
00:53:33,520 --> 00:53:38,720
you know, diverse roster of characters that looked very like they all had very big personalities

606
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:42,400
that look like a lot of fun. I felt like I was watching

607
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:48,160
like a good Netflix anime type of thing. But the problem was, where's the game?

608
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:54,400
They're just trying to build hype. I know, but it's, you know, and that's,

609
00:53:55,360 --> 00:54:00,080
it's it's hard because I just I'm kind of where's the game? What am I supposed to get hyped about?

610
00:54:00,080 --> 00:54:05,520
Because we're all old enough to know that isn't what the game really looks like. So look, I get

611
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:12,800
from a concept level, okay, they sold it. And my brain goes way back to when Blizzard first teased

612
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:18,480
Overwatch. They had their epic cinematic, right? And that was really to sell the universe,

613
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:22,720
this brand new IP that they're putting out. And they really did a kick ass job of it. But they

614
00:54:22,720 --> 00:54:26,480
immediately followed it up with, oh, and this game is playable on the show floor at Blizzcon.

615
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:30,400
So people knew like that it was going to be like a Team Fortress-esque type of game right off the

616
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:35,280
bat. We don't really know what this game is. And that's the only problem I really had with it,

617
00:54:35,360 --> 00:54:40,720
especially as a closer. I was just kind of surprised, like a new IP that you're not

618
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:46,320
really showing us the game is the closer. It was just an interesting choice. I'm not saying like,

619
00:54:46,320 --> 00:54:51,840
it was a choice fail. I'm not saying fail. I'm just like, I'm not, I would have probably just

620
00:54:51,840 --> 00:54:57,440
maybe ended with the Forza Horizon 5, but, or see, I'm kind of like maybe the Starfield thing,

621
00:54:57,440 --> 00:55:01,120
but then I think I would have had the same bitch is that they're not actually showing gameplay.

622
00:55:01,120 --> 00:55:08,160
Why did they do that last? So I don't know. Um, choices. Yeah. Zen Monkey in chat says,

623
00:55:08,160 --> 00:55:12,480
I loved it. We'll see the game early next year. It's Borderlands with vampires set in the present

624
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:16,640
day. Yeah. And again, I'm not trying to shit on people that did enjoy it. That's great. I mean,

625
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:21,040
that's what it's trying to do is build hype, get you into this. But for me, I'm just like,

626
00:55:21,040 --> 00:55:25,440
where's the game, sis? I got to see like, what, like, and that's, that's when I'm going to know

627
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:31,280
if I'm like, Ooh, I'm into this or I don't know. It looks a little, not my type of thing. Like

628
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:36,160
kind of like stalker too. I'm like, this looks really pretty. Probably not the type of thing

629
00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:45,200
I'm into, but it is on game pass. So, I mean, maybe I check it out that way. So, um, Questbuster

630
00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:50,480
in chat says there's also vampire blood hunt based on the masquerade IP that's coming out this year,

631
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:57,120
a vampire battle royale. Yeah. I thought of that too. So definitely, um, zombies out with that's

632
00:55:57,120 --> 00:56:01,440
old news. I mean, sure we have back for blood coming too, but zombies that's, that's the old

633
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:06,880
vampires. That's the hot shit. But here's my question. Do the vampires sparkle?

634
00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:15,440
No, because they're real vampires. But sparkle dark Sakura. No.

635
00:56:15,440 --> 00:56:22,320
All right. The answer is always no. What else from Microsoft's event do I need to mention,

636
00:56:22,320 --> 00:56:27,360
Loki? Halo Infinite looks amazing. Oh yeah. Yeah. I guess I thought I touched on that a little bit.

637
00:56:28,240 --> 00:56:34,240
Well, did they recover from what they showed last time, which was not well received? Absolutely.

638
00:56:34,240 --> 00:56:40,160
Which for the record, I wasn't bothered by what I saw last time. I didn't think they had to make it.

639
00:56:40,160 --> 00:56:44,320
Yeah. I just was like, okay, it's got a Halo one vibe. They're, they're doing a throwback thing,

640
00:56:44,320 --> 00:56:50,080
but they really went out of their way to like show, like, look where the game's at now. It's

641
00:56:50,080 --> 00:56:54,240
in a very different place. So, I mean, good for them. Uh, the only thing that was a little muddled

642
00:56:54,240 --> 00:56:58,480
for me and maybe chat, you guys can help me clear this up. I don't understand what they meant when

643
00:56:58,480 --> 00:57:05,360
they said episode one is out this holiday. Did they just mean the multiplayer episode one? Or

644
00:57:05,360 --> 00:57:10,160
are they like dividing up the main game because it's not all going to be done yet. That was the

645
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:14,560
part that threw me a little bit. And I was like, they, that muddled the message for me big time.

646
00:57:14,560 --> 00:57:20,320
I wish they hadn't done that, but otherwise multiplayer and then have the story campaign is

647
00:57:20,320 --> 00:57:27,360
split up. Maybe, maybe, I don't know. So, uh, everybody in chat is still yelling about me

648
00:57:27,360 --> 00:57:32,880
talking about sparkling vampires. Sorry about that. Uh, fifth dream does say infinite implies

649
00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:39,040
game as a service. I E in pieces. Well, that is a fair point. Absolutely. But they also mentioned

650
00:57:39,040 --> 00:57:44,800
it was a ship too, or their place or something. Yeah. Yeah. And so I'm kind of like, well,

651
00:57:44,800 --> 00:57:51,840
what are they charging 60 bucks for then? I don't even, are they charging $60? Cause like,

652
00:57:51,840 --> 00:57:56,240
we don't know what the price is yet. I guess that's true too. It could be $70. Well, but then

653
00:57:56,240 --> 00:58:00,720
for a lot of people it's game pass. And that was kind of the thing that's kind of what I left with

654
00:58:00,720 --> 00:58:04,720
on that as I was like, well, are they releasing part of the game or I was like, well, it doesn't

655
00:58:04,720 --> 00:58:09,280
really matter. Cause I have game pass. So I'll just get whatever they put out again,

656
00:58:09,280 --> 00:58:14,160
a lovely game pass commercial Microsoft put out today, a very lovely game pass commercial.

657
00:58:14,800 --> 00:58:21,840
So, all right. Uh, pretty cool as well. Which one? I got a stock or two. I got it. Well,

658
00:58:21,840 --> 00:58:24,480
I mean, it's pretty obvious cause it's pretty similar, but I got a very,

659
00:58:25,280 --> 00:58:28,880
you know, Metro vibe from that, but I mean, it looks good.

660
00:58:29,120 --> 00:58:36,560
Uh, Phoenix 77, 26 talking about the, uh, halo release says, I mean, look at FIFA Rob

661
00:58:36,560 --> 00:58:43,040
and the shit that does for $60 USD. Uh, E3VL says $60 for campaign multiplayer live service

662
00:58:43,040 --> 00:58:46,480
multiplayer is free to play. Yeah. I definitely caught that. And that's a great thing. And I

663
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:49,920
think we should all be thankful to go back to Phoenix's comment. We should all be thankful.

664
00:58:49,920 --> 00:58:59,280
It's not an EA game. All right. So, all right. Uh, yeah. And Pele Hanumea says the plot to

665
00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:02,400
infinite is where's Cortana. That sure looked like what they were kind of showing there,

666
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:06,800
but it looks really pretty everything that was there. So cool. All right. Anything else

667
00:59:06,800 --> 00:59:14,160
from Microsoft before we move on to the next one? Okay. Let's move on. Let's talk about the last

668
00:59:14,160 --> 00:59:19,520
one that I watched today and that was a square Enix's event. Um, Oh yeah. Let's talk about some

669
00:59:19,520 --> 00:59:30,080
fucking choices. Jesus. Like, I'm kind of excited about the pixel remaster. I'm not, I'm, I'm

670
00:59:30,080 --> 00:59:34,080
pissed about it. I'm, I'm straight up pissed about it. I'm going to tell you why it was the very end

671
00:59:34,080 --> 00:59:39,120
of the trailer that said coming for steam and mobile. And do you guys not have phones?

672
00:59:40,720 --> 00:59:46,800
Here's the thing. When's and square's done this before when they put games out on steam that are

673
00:59:46,800 --> 00:59:52,880
just mobile ports, they're terrible. And look, I'm sorry. Final fantasy is not, especially the

674
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:58,080
classic games are not meant to be played on mobile. Like I'm fine with RPGs that are created

675
00:59:58,080 --> 01:00:02,800
for the mobile space with the touch controller and all that in mind. Case in point, Fantasian.

676
01:00:02,800 --> 01:00:08,160
Great. That is good. Yeah. And that is like the final fantasy esque thing for mobile. I'm thrilled

677
01:00:08,160 --> 01:00:12,880
that exists and I want to play it at some point. I don't need final fantasy six shoe horn on a

678
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:19,680
fucking mobile phone again. Like I just, that's what's irritating me about it. I, I'm not looking

679
01:00:19,680 --> 01:00:25,200
at it the same way. I'm looking at it with hopefully having that same sort of control

680
01:00:25,200 --> 01:00:32,560
like Fantasian does. And if so, I'd be super happy with it. You know what I wanted, I want to be able

681
01:00:32,560 --> 01:00:39,920
to play it on my Mac. I'm, I'm happy to be proved wrong and it ends up being okay. But I just, I

682
01:00:39,920 --> 01:00:45,840
guess I'm disappointed. It's not like on the switch. Which seems to be the perfect place for

683
01:00:45,840 --> 01:00:51,040
something like that. And then I actually have my controller and I can play it like, and, and just

684
01:00:51,040 --> 01:00:55,920
to package just like final fantasy one and two from game boy advance. I don't know what they

685
01:00:55,920 --> 01:00:59,840
would do for three. I guess they could do a new translation of that or whatever that that's going

686
01:00:59,840 --> 01:01:04,000
to be the most interesting release is final fantasy three, in my opinion, because keep in mind,

687
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:08,240
we've only ever gotten that game in the 3d remake localized. So it's going to be interesting that

688
01:01:08,240 --> 01:01:13,040
that's the most interesting one to me. And if I buy any of them, it'll be that one. And then,

689
01:01:13,040 --> 01:01:18,240
you know, four had a great version on PSP and so on. So it's not like it's not the pixel remaster

690
01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:23,840
part that bothers me. It's just the whole fact that if they're aiming for mobile, I'm, I'm not

691
01:01:23,840 --> 01:01:29,920
sure I'm into it. But we do still have Nintendo's event on Tuesday. And they could end up announcing

692
01:01:29,920 --> 01:01:33,840
it again. And it's coming to switch as well. Although I'm trying to be a realist about that.

693
01:01:33,840 --> 01:01:39,040
And I realized that is probably not going to happen. But I just like I was so kicked in the

694
01:01:39,040 --> 01:01:44,400
gut after that, that I just, I almost like tuned out the rest of the Square Enix thing. I was just

695
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:53,360
like, I just, why? But anyway, so there was some other stuff. The Guardians of the Galaxy game. So

696
01:01:53,360 --> 01:01:58,560
Dark Soccer, you brought this up earlier. They spent a lot of time on it a lot, a lot of time

697
01:01:58,560 --> 01:02:03,600
on that Guardians of the Galaxy game. But I thought I thought it looked decent. And

698
01:02:03,600 --> 01:02:09,360
I liked it. It's based more off the comic look. Yeah. Yeah. Shane had a great tweet about it.

699
01:02:09,360 --> 01:02:13,600
He tweeted something like, Hey, since a Star Lord doesn't look like Chris Pratt at all,

700
01:02:13,600 --> 01:02:17,040
I'm kind of into this. Yeah, I thought it was funny.

701
01:02:18,880 --> 01:02:23,680
It's I like that Gamora looks like she does in the comics.

702
01:02:24,080 --> 01:02:27,680
Yeah. Yeah, they all do. I think that you can only play Star Lord.

703
01:02:30,240 --> 01:02:35,680
As far as we know, I'm sure there'll be DLC or something, but who knows? But a lot of people

704
01:02:35,680 --> 01:02:40,240
were right off the bat kind of boxing that. Well, I don't say boxing it in, but throwing it in,

705
01:02:40,240 --> 01:02:47,200
sorting it in with the Avengers game. And it's important to note Avengers was done by a different

706
01:02:47,200 --> 01:02:53,040
studio. So this Guardians of the Galaxy is coming from Eidos Montreal. So it is being developed in

707
01:02:53,040 --> 01:02:58,560
a different place. So I and they were very big to say at the beginning, this is a single player

708
01:02:58,560 --> 01:03:03,200
game, or at least has a single player experience. So they were trying to kind of differentiate it

709
01:03:03,200 --> 01:03:10,480
from the beginning from what you might see with the Avengers or what have you. Alan bought me a

710
01:03:10,480 --> 01:03:15,680
present. Look at this. Look at this from Target. Thank you, Alan. Can you actually since you're

711
01:03:15,680 --> 01:03:19,680
standing? I know you guys can't see I'll describe put it closer to the camera. Just so folks see it.

712
01:03:19,680 --> 01:03:25,840
It's a little Street Fighter two mini machine. But that actually has like the full controller

713
01:03:25,840 --> 01:03:32,160
with the six buttons. Yeah, right. All right. I need one of those. He got it at Target. But it's

714
01:03:32,160 --> 01:03:39,120
I think wasn't it like $50? 50 bucks. But this is bucks. I can just play this. This is a little

715
01:03:39,120 --> 01:03:45,520
more solid than the this is by far bigger than any of the other mini cabs I have. That's for sure.

716
01:03:45,520 --> 01:03:50,080
Wow, this has a huge cord that goes with it, too. That's, that's something else. So there you go.

717
01:03:50,880 --> 01:03:55,840
SG100 Matt says Alan loves me. Yeah, that's true. That's true. Thank you, Alan.

718
01:03:58,320 --> 01:04:02,880
He did have to ask. Am I allowed to spend $50 on this for you? And I'm like, Well, if it's for me,

719
01:04:02,880 --> 01:04:10,400
yeah. All right. All right. It does look good. That game looks pretty awesome. Yeah. So let's

720
01:04:10,400 --> 01:04:14,800
see. Sorry. Sorry. I derailed us a little bit. But that's the joy of doing things live. So yeah,

721
01:04:14,800 --> 01:04:18,880
Guardians of the Galaxy. I'm into it. I want to check it out. What else did they announce? They

722
01:04:18,880 --> 01:04:24,720
had that what was the the Babylon? That was the game that was right after the final? Yeah, the

723
01:04:24,720 --> 01:04:29,120
the thing that was right after the Final Fantasy news. So I was kind of seeing fall. Yeah. I mean,

724
01:04:29,120 --> 01:04:35,520
it did look interesting, though. It's a platinum thing, right? Yeah. So I want to check out the

725
01:04:35,520 --> 01:04:39,120
beta that game for sure. And then I think the other big thing they announced there was that

726
01:04:39,120 --> 01:04:43,520
Final Fantasy origin. That whole thing had been rumored on various, you know, Twitter's social

727
01:04:43,520 --> 01:04:48,400
media web forums for a little bit is that Final Fantasy is getting a Dark Souls esque type of

728
01:04:48,400 --> 01:04:53,040
game because that is now all the rage apparently between things like Elden Ring. And now we've got

729
01:04:53,040 --> 01:04:58,000
this coming as well as the Final Fantasy take on the Dark Souls. Although it appears to be

730
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:02,880
possibly something that's like a prequel to Final Fantasy one, because it's it's Final Fantasy

731
01:05:02,880 --> 01:05:08,560
origin, not to be confused with Final Fantasy origins, a great PlayStation compilation of old

732
01:05:08,560 --> 01:05:14,400
Final Fantasy games that were not done for mobile. But anyway, it's like it's a little too

733
01:05:16,080 --> 01:05:23,920
Devil May Cry. Yeah, I think Team Ninja. So that reminded me a lot of like Ninja Gaiden or

734
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:30,800
something like that. Yeah, they're redos of Ninja Gaiden, but it's. I suppose it would be

735
01:05:30,800 --> 01:05:36,160
interesting. I mean, it's in the universe, but, you know, I don't know. Well, I'm happy.

736
01:05:36,720 --> 01:05:40,720
Go ahead. Well, I was just saying as much as I love Final Fantasy seven,

737
01:05:40,720 --> 01:05:47,360
at least it's not a Final Fantasy seven universe. Yeah, and I'm I'm I'm glad they're doing a demo

738
01:05:47,360 --> 01:05:51,040
to even if I don't have a PlayStation five. So I'm a little bit like sad that they don't have

739
01:05:51,040 --> 01:05:56,560
a comparable thing on Series X right now, but at least they have a demo coming out so we can get

740
01:05:56,560 --> 01:06:00,960
a better sense of, you know, what is this game? And that does show that they really believe in it.

741
01:06:00,960 --> 01:06:06,640
You know, to put out a demo can really make or break your entire game. And especially if you're

742
01:06:06,640 --> 01:06:11,680
Square Enix, Square Enix knows this better than anyone right now. Hello, Balan Wonderland, right?

743
01:06:11,680 --> 01:06:17,440
A demo can make or break your entire game. Although, you know, then there was also Ni No

744
01:06:17,440 --> 01:06:21,280
Kuni, which had a terrible demo, but the game turned out okay. But I digress. But the fact

745
01:06:21,280 --> 01:06:24,480
that they're putting it out there and actually having a demo that's playable, I think is pretty

746
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:30,160
interesting. So I want to check. I'm sure somebody will stream that demo or it'll be on YouTube.

747
01:06:30,160 --> 01:06:36,400
So I can at least get a sense of like what it's all about that way. So it'll be interesting. I'm

748
01:06:36,400 --> 01:06:40,880
curious about it. I'm willing to give it a shot. Let's put it that way. Because it does seem like

749
01:06:40,880 --> 01:06:44,880
Final Fantasy wants a franchise out of this because the name of the game is not Final Fantasy

750
01:06:44,880 --> 01:06:50,400
Origin. The name of the game is something else that escapes me in the moment. It had a different

751
01:06:50,400 --> 01:06:54,720
title. Rangers of Paradise. Thank you. Stranger of Paradise. Stranger of Paradise,

752
01:06:54,720 --> 01:06:59,840
Final Fantasy Origin. So ending though on that trailer, though, did kind of give me a little

753
01:06:59,840 --> 01:07:05,840
bit of a chill. How so? Just with Garland. Yeah, true. True. I mean, I saw it coming,

754
01:07:05,840 --> 01:07:12,080
but at the same time was just like, hey, I like it. I can't wait for the sequel, though. Stranger

755
01:07:12,080 --> 01:07:18,640
of Paradise, Chocoba Racing Origin. It's going to be amazing. I hope so. I hope so. A Souls-like

756
01:07:18,640 --> 01:07:25,200
Chocoba Racing game. I think many folks probably surprised. No updates on Final Fantasy 16.

757
01:07:26,160 --> 01:07:30,960
No. So I guess that'll be ready when it's ready. I mean, I don't think any of us were anticipating

758
01:07:30,960 --> 01:07:37,520
it this year anyway. So maybe they just would rather keep. I guess that super cut at the very

759
01:07:37,520 --> 01:07:42,560
end of the Square Enix thing might have had like two seconds of new footage of Final Fantasy 16.

760
01:07:42,560 --> 01:07:48,480
But otherwise, they didn't really have an update on it. So, you know, which all right,

761
01:07:48,480 --> 01:07:51,840
if it's not ready, it's not ready. And we're probably not seeing it till next year,

762
01:07:51,840 --> 01:07:56,320
realistically anyway. So, but I was a little surprised there wasn't an update because it's

763
01:07:56,320 --> 01:08:03,760
such a tentpole title for Square Enix, but okay. I mean, they did Creative Unit 3 did just have

764
01:08:03,760 --> 01:08:08,960
their Final Fantasy 14 showcase a few weeks ago. So maybe they just weren't ready to talk about 16

765
01:08:08,960 --> 01:08:17,600
right away. I don't know, whatever. So, no. All right. Well, there were other things that weren't

766
01:08:17,600 --> 01:08:22,960
in the big batches. Yeah. Anything else you want to shout out here before we get to predictions or

767
01:08:22,960 --> 01:08:28,320
whatever? The Among Us stuff is kind of cute. Oh yeah. Well, that was in the Microsoft thing.

768
01:08:29,200 --> 01:08:34,560
Was it? I didn't notice. Actually, I think it was in the Microsoft and Summer Game Fest. You know,

769
01:08:34,560 --> 01:08:39,360
that game is still huge. What was your take on all that? Well, just the, I mean, it's not,

770
01:08:39,360 --> 01:08:43,920
I think it would be nicer, especially with all the streamers that I watched it play a lot of

771
01:08:43,920 --> 01:08:51,120
Among Us. It definitely allows for more friends to get together and have fun being totally sus.

772
01:08:52,720 --> 01:08:56,880
The colors though were interesting. Like I'm totally into the maroon.

773
01:08:58,880 --> 01:09:02,720
Yeah. And the expansion to 15 players, right? Cause that, the 10 is the old.

774
01:09:02,720 --> 01:09:06,720
That's what I was just saying about the 15. Being able to play with more people.

775
01:09:06,720 --> 01:09:10,320
Oh, and of course the Jeff outfit, the Jeff Keeley outfit. That was the big thing.

776
01:09:10,800 --> 01:09:18,640
Yeah. That return. Yes, there is that. But I mean, this, the game itself was sort of like,

777
01:09:19,520 --> 01:09:23,840
it took a little bit of time for it to really take off and now it's super taken off.

778
01:09:24,560 --> 01:09:31,760
And I think that it's just, I mean, just another thing for the power of the internet, you know?

779
01:09:33,760 --> 01:09:38,080
For sure. That's how I look at it. Any other games you want to shout out?

780
01:09:38,720 --> 01:09:42,000
You or Loki before we, yeah. No.

781
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:45,040
Okay. I didn't watch this, so no. All right.

782
01:09:45,040 --> 01:09:51,120
I mean, totally, totally not part of, part of the thing, but we get our new Dead by Daylight DLC

783
01:09:51,120 --> 01:09:56,320
soon and I'm kind of quaking for it. Yeah, that'll be exciting. That's for sure.

784
01:09:56,320 --> 01:10:02,880
So, yes. Yeah. Well, I know we have a Dead by Daylight story coming up later and what was

785
01:10:02,880 --> 01:10:07,520
diverting your attention today, but we'll get into that a little later. For now, let's talk about the

786
01:10:07,520 --> 01:10:11,440
upcoming week because we are right in the middle of things. So we're taping this on Sunday night.

787
01:10:11,440 --> 01:10:15,280
So by the time some of you are listening to this podcast, we may actually have more details on

788
01:10:15,280 --> 01:10:19,200
things that we didn't know about at the time we were taping this. And certainly one of the big

789
01:10:19,200 --> 01:10:24,320
things, you know, if you're listening to this after Tuesday, Nintendo will have had their direct

790
01:10:24,320 --> 01:10:29,920
Tuesday morning. And, you know, the bar is set pretty high for Nintendo, I think. There's a lot,

791
01:10:29,920 --> 01:10:36,160
you know, and probably mistakenly so by a lot of people. There's this weird ass rumor going

792
01:10:36,160 --> 01:10:42,640
around right now about the whole GameStop ad that says New Nintendo Switch when I,

793
01:10:44,240 --> 01:10:48,800
I'm going to be, I'm going to be completely, I'm just gonna say it. Consider the source on that,

794
01:10:48,800 --> 01:10:53,920
which is one of the most clickbaity game journalists I've ever seen in my life.

795
01:10:53,920 --> 01:10:56,560
And we don't have to drag him in chat if you know what I'm talking about.

796
01:10:58,240 --> 01:11:03,280
I just, I think it's one of the most clickbaity people I've ever seen in my life. And if you look

797
01:11:03,280 --> 01:11:08,160
on that ad that they're like, oh, it said the New Nintendo Switch. It literally says the promotion

798
01:11:08,160 --> 01:11:12,480
starts today. So if there was a New Nintendo Switch, I think we would have known about it

799
01:11:12,480 --> 01:11:20,640
today. So I think they meant new as in not used or new as in the remake that has the better battery,

800
01:11:20,640 --> 01:11:25,200
because even the picture was still the old Nintendo Switch. So I don't, I don't know what,

801
01:11:25,200 --> 01:11:29,520
I think they're making something out of nothing, which is what clickbait journalists do. So,

802
01:11:29,600 --> 01:11:35,280
whatever. Anyhow, and Nintendo has said they're not announcing hardware. Like they said very

803
01:11:35,280 --> 01:11:40,240
plainly, it's 40 minutes of software. And I really do think there is the potential that they delayed

804
01:11:40,240 --> 01:11:44,160
the hardware suddenly to next year when they realized they would not be able to make enough.

805
01:11:45,280 --> 01:11:49,040
For a change, Nintendo probably made the right decision in that aspect.

806
01:11:49,040 --> 01:11:54,800
But let's talk about the software that we might see from Nintendo. You know, huge, if we want to

807
01:11:54,800 --> 01:12:00,800
believe rumors, although in my opinion, a lot of Nintendo rumors are kind of all bullshit right

808
01:12:00,800 --> 01:12:04,960
now because that New Nintendo thing is not playing out. So I don't know how much stock I put in this

809
01:12:04,960 --> 01:12:11,600
whole 2D Metroid thing that supposedly is what we're going to see. I would, don't get me wrong,

810
01:12:11,600 --> 01:12:15,680
I would fucking love it. But I'm not going to, I'm not going to set that bar and just get

811
01:12:15,680 --> 01:12:22,000
disappointed. So if it happens, yay. I would also be yay just with a simple Metroid Prime 4 update.

812
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:26,080
And even if they also date it for 2022, I'm fine with that. And because that's probably

813
01:12:26,080 --> 01:12:34,160
how long it's going to take, honestly. So, but 40 minutes is a lot for Nintendo.

814
01:12:34,160 --> 01:12:34,960
That's a lot of time.

815
01:12:34,960 --> 01:12:36,080
That is a lot of time.

816
01:12:37,360 --> 01:12:45,040
Well, and they, I have a feeling they are going to unveil something big and do a deep dive.

817
01:12:45,920 --> 01:12:51,840
Um, because look at things like Game Builder Garage or some of the other recent stuff this

818
01:12:51,840 --> 01:12:56,800
year. Nintendo is announcing things with a six week lead time. So it is very, and this is,

819
01:12:56,800 --> 01:13:01,600
I think what's realistic. If whether it's a 2D Metroid or something else, I think Nintendo

820
01:13:01,600 --> 01:13:06,640
will announce like a Labor Day game and give us a deep dive on it, on why we're all going

821
01:13:06,640 --> 01:13:10,880
to pre-order it today. So we'll, we'll see. We'll see what happens with that.

822
01:13:11,440 --> 01:13:17,120
Um, some folks in chat E3VL says, I just want a Breath of the Wild 2 gameplay trailer. Dark

823
01:13:17,120 --> 01:13:20,880
Tetsuya says, yeah, I'd love to see more on Breath of the Wild 2. Um, big same, you know,

824
01:13:20,880 --> 01:13:24,640
I have strong feelings on that. I think Nintendo really needs to put up or shut up on that.

825
01:13:24,640 --> 01:13:28,400
And yes, I know at the end of the day, it's not going to change sales whatsoever. They can,

826
01:13:28,400 --> 01:13:34,160
they can do whatever they want, but I just, it's like, come on. Like, you know, where it,

827
01:13:34,160 --> 01:13:40,240
give the fans something, like it just starts to feel like they don't care about fans when they,

828
01:13:40,240 --> 01:13:44,560
when they go so long without even like just a hint of information. It's just,

829
01:13:45,280 --> 01:13:52,080
yeah, a lot to me. Uh, SheHulk10 in chat says, I need Donkey Kong. I could see that as well

830
01:13:52,080 --> 01:13:57,680
as like a surprise Labor Day release. I think something like that, like a Donkey Kong, uh,

831
01:13:57,680 --> 01:14:01,840
in the style of Tropical Freeze and that whole thing. I think a Donkey Kong game like that

832
01:14:01,840 --> 01:14:06,160
coming out Labor Day, like a six week lead time and they do a deep dive on it. I think that is,

833
01:14:06,160 --> 01:14:10,240
I think that is a realistic prediction, but it is a prediction for sure.

834
01:14:10,240 --> 01:14:16,080
I would just like to see something. It'd be nice for like a new Mario Kart. I think it'd be,

835
01:14:16,080 --> 01:14:20,080
I mean, it's really, it's been a while since we've had any Mario Kart game since the last

836
01:14:20,080 --> 01:14:24,720
one that they released was on the Wii U. Not counting the world or the camera game,

837
01:14:24,720 --> 01:14:30,880
the AR game. That was, that was its own thing. That was, that was, yeah, I think you have to,

838
01:14:30,880 --> 01:14:35,360
but you know, you know, they're going to say it. If I don't say we had the, the, the AR game,

839
01:14:35,360 --> 01:14:38,320
they're going to say, we just got a Mario game last year, Loki.

840
01:14:38,320 --> 01:14:42,240
Yeah, that doesn't even count though. It's like, we have the mobile game too.

841
01:14:42,800 --> 01:14:48,720
That I would think counted more than the AR game. Like I think I've learned my lesson with not

842
01:14:48,720 --> 01:14:55,280
buying any more AR things from them. Like it just, it just doesn't get used at all. Um,

843
01:14:57,920 --> 01:15:01,760
I don't know. We'll see. I'm not, I don't have high expectations

844
01:15:02,560 --> 01:15:05,200
because, you know, if you do that, you're just gonna get disappointed.

845
01:15:05,200 --> 01:15:08,880
Yeah, I understand. I just hope there's a couple of nice things that are like,

846
01:15:08,880 --> 01:15:14,880
we're going to release it today. Cause I love that stuff. I love this. Maybe another 99 game,

847
01:15:14,880 --> 01:15:20,000
even though they just did the Pac-Man one, but I would, I would be all about like a new 99 game.

848
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:25,280
I think that would be fun. Um, but you know, I I'm, I'm always, I would, I would love to see

849
01:15:25,280 --> 01:15:30,000
the NES remix series come back. Um, another sleeper series I'd love to see come back.

850
01:15:30,320 --> 01:15:34,800
And this one gets rumored a lot Wario where, where the hell's that been? I'd love to see

851
01:15:34,800 --> 01:15:40,160
that come back on switch. Um, but again, I don't want to, you know, set the bar too crazy high

852
01:15:40,160 --> 01:15:47,040
because it'll just be disappointment. So, um, She-Hulk 10 in chat says Nintendo needs

853
01:15:47,040 --> 01:15:53,360
X-Box game pass streaming X-Box games. Oh, like an X cloud player. Um, I, you know,

854
01:15:53,360 --> 01:15:58,400
I think there's a lot of people that would be so fucking hype if something like that happens.

855
01:15:58,400 --> 01:16:04,000
But I, I, that, that is like, uh, that is one of those things where like, if we were betting

856
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:09,040
illegally on what would be announced, like that would be a high odd thing. That would be like a,

857
01:16:09,040 --> 01:16:14,640
uh, 50 to one odds that something like that happens, you know, that's a, that's a stretch.

858
01:16:14,640 --> 01:16:20,160
I don't know. Um, but it is interesting, isn't it? When Phil Spencer sits there and he has a

859
01:16:20,160 --> 01:16:25,920
switch sitting behind him, it is. But for me, I'm like, well, that's just like, you know, that's,

860
01:16:25,920 --> 01:16:32,320
um, Psychonauts 2 coming to switch. You know, I, I, I don't know if I'm willing to say,

861
01:16:32,320 --> 01:16:36,240
it's going to be this X cloud thing, but it would, Holy shit, would that be amazing?

862
01:16:36,800 --> 01:16:43,200
That would be, I'm sure he wouldn't say no. Microsoft doesn't have a portable system.

863
01:16:44,640 --> 01:16:50,000
Nintendo would have the strength of Microsoft's library on their portable system, but is it worth

864
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:54,160
it to them? I don't know. I just, I there there's a lot of it where I'm like, it just,

865
01:16:54,800 --> 01:17:01,280
I feel like that the fanboy want is outreach outweighing the realization of what is realistic

866
01:17:01,280 --> 01:17:07,040
and good business sense, especially for a company like Nintendo. So I don't, I'm not willing to put

867
01:17:07,040 --> 01:17:11,360
my heart too much into that rumor. I think it's rad as hell. I'd love it, but I just,

868
01:17:11,360 --> 01:17:16,640
I think realistically it's not going to happen, but I, I will, I will sit here and happily eat

869
01:17:16,640 --> 01:17:21,840
my words with a big old spoon on next week's show. I will happily do that. We'll just say that there's

870
01:17:21,840 --> 01:17:25,840
no new Nintendo switch. And what they're doing instead is that, you know, game passes coming

871
01:17:25,840 --> 01:17:31,600
to switch and Nintendo games are coming to the Xbox series X. There you go. Dream the fuck on

872
01:17:31,600 --> 01:17:37,840
with that one. All right, let's move on. Let's talk about, okay. I think that was finally

873
01:17:37,840 --> 01:17:42,080
everything like E3 and summer game fast and all that stuff. Let's talk about our gaming

874
01:17:42,080 --> 01:17:45,840
weeks and the types of games that we have been playing this week. I think dark soccer stepped

875
01:17:45,840 --> 01:17:48,960
away cause her camera's off. So Loki, I'll start with you. How was your gaming week?

876
01:17:49,600 --> 01:17:56,640
It was incredible. So this week, as I talked about last week, I actually recorded my streaming

877
01:17:56,640 --> 01:18:05,520
session today with Tango from, from hermitcraft. So that was fun. We didn't really build a ton.

878
01:18:05,520 --> 01:18:09,840
It was more of just kind of just sitting there and like chatting while we were just like trying

879
01:18:09,840 --> 01:18:16,240
to place blocks. Cause like it's kind of silly. I brought them on and I'm like, so what I did

880
01:18:17,200 --> 01:18:19,760
and this will be all into my video too when I, when I put it out.

881
01:18:20,880 --> 01:18:32,800
So I had spent this entire week crafting a very immense redstone machine. So what it was is,

882
01:18:32,800 --> 01:18:40,800
is this giant light board. It was that would scroll his logo across it and then freeze for

883
01:18:40,800 --> 01:18:46,160
a second and then animate off. So it was like an animated like logo board thing. So I built that

884
01:18:46,720 --> 01:18:55,280
creative, brought it back into the server and built it in survival there. And then what I had

885
01:18:55,280 --> 01:19:02,000
planned to do, but I ran out of time was I was going to make a joke about how my gold farm

886
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:06,080
produces way too much gravel. So I was going to cover the whole thing in gravel and just like

887
01:19:06,800 --> 01:19:13,200
kind of reveal it. There's a way you can kind of use scaffolding and stuff to drop gravel,

888
01:19:13,200 --> 01:19:18,880
kind of like dropping a curtain or something like that. And so that was going to be the joke

889
01:19:18,880 --> 01:19:23,840
is that, but instead I just showed it to him and what we were going to do is build the building

890
01:19:23,840 --> 01:19:30,480
that was going to go around that. And so that's what we did. He's not much, he doesn't normally

891
01:19:30,480 --> 01:19:36,640
do building so much. It's not like something he'll more like, you know, like making the redstone

892
01:19:36,640 --> 01:19:42,480
systems and stuff like that. So we both kind of struggled like coming up, it was like

893
01:19:43,040 --> 01:19:50,320
creative blockers and we're just like, so we ended up just kind of messing around for like,

894
01:19:50,880 --> 01:19:54,320
you know, two hours or whatever. So I showed him around the server and everything, but yeah,

895
01:19:54,320 --> 01:19:58,160
it was fun. I was picking his brain on like content creation stuff, his process and all that

896
01:19:58,720 --> 01:20:05,520
and just like, you know, getting tips on, you know, stuff. And so it was fun. It was, it was

897
01:20:05,520 --> 01:20:11,920
nice. And then at the end, you know, it was basically like, Hey, I want to, you know,

898
01:20:11,920 --> 01:20:17,440
you know, we're going to stay friends on discord, you know, you know, send me, you know, show me

899
01:20:17,440 --> 01:20:21,280
what, you know, once you've finished the build, send me a screenshot, you know, and, you know,

900
01:20:21,280 --> 01:20:24,960
keep me up to date with what you're doing and stuff like that. So like, awesome. I think that's

901
01:20:24,960 --> 01:20:29,280
cool. Like I really enjoyed that. That's kind of what I was trying to get out of it. So it, yeah,

902
01:20:29,840 --> 01:20:34,560
it was really cool. That was very nervous. Oh my God. I've been up to like two in the morning,

903
01:20:34,560 --> 01:20:38,240
the last two days, because I've been trying to like cram everything into this time,

904
01:20:38,240 --> 01:20:45,040
but like, it was just, it was so worth it. So that was basically what I did this week. Like I said,

905
01:20:45,040 --> 01:20:50,320
I will be making a video with it. I don't know when it's going to be out yet. Cause I have to,

906
01:20:50,320 --> 01:20:55,360
I want to finish the build that we started. Cause we got like part of a wall and then there's,

907
01:20:55,360 --> 01:20:58,160
there's some funny stuff with that too. Like I don't want to spoil it, but like,

908
01:20:58,160 --> 01:21:06,400
um, it was pretty funny when we noticed something in the, in the, yeah, fun times are had, but, um,

909
01:21:06,400 --> 01:21:12,160
so yeah, it's, um, uh, I'm very much looking forward to putting it out. I still want to,

910
01:21:12,160 --> 01:21:17,920
you know, keep going with the content creation stuff. Um, yeah, just going to get better.

911
01:21:17,920 --> 01:21:21,840
Each episode I put out learning more, just learning from my mistakes,

912
01:21:21,840 --> 01:21:25,200
that type of thing. So yeah, that's pretty much that. That's it. I hope he gives your

913
01:21:25,280 --> 01:21:27,920
video a shout too. I hope you get that exposure. It's going to be great.

914
01:21:27,920 --> 01:21:32,080
That would be amazing. I don't have any expectations for that though.

915
01:21:33,440 --> 01:21:39,840
I would love that, but I absolutely wouldn't expect that at all. It's more of just like,

916
01:21:39,840 --> 01:21:45,520
that would be cool, but like absolutely no expectations though. That said, if you do follow,

917
01:21:45,520 --> 01:21:49,520
um, the Hermitcraft stuff, I think the next season's coming very soon.

918
01:21:49,520 --> 01:21:55,760
He sort of hinted at that, but like, um, there is, uh, one of the guys on there,

919
01:21:55,760 --> 01:22:00,400
Ren dog, he put out his, uh, finale, which he edited together. He's a big Star Wars fan.

920
01:22:00,400 --> 01:22:04,560
So his like built are all Star Wars theme. And so it's a great watch. He's like, did this big

921
01:22:04,560 --> 01:22:08,720
old animated movie thing. So, um, that's worth checking out, but like, yeah, they're all great.

922
01:22:08,720 --> 01:22:13,680
Like I just would, I would absolutely love that, but like that's so far in the future,

923
01:22:13,680 --> 01:22:17,840
like that's so far in the future, but like, yeah, I, we had a great conversation about

924
01:22:17,840 --> 01:22:23,040
pixel poops. Number two, that was fun. Oh, really? Oh, cool. He thought that was great.

925
01:22:23,040 --> 01:22:27,840
Um, but yeah, yeah. Fun times. It was fun. I really enjoyed it.

926
01:22:27,840 --> 01:22:30,240
Good, good, good. Happy to happy to hear it. Can't wait to see the video.

927
01:22:30,800 --> 01:22:33,280
Um, dark soccer, let's go to you. How was your gaming week?

928
01:22:34,560 --> 01:22:37,280
I actually did not play animal crossing at all.

929
01:22:37,840 --> 01:22:40,240
But because you've played three times as much dead by daylight.

930
01:22:41,200 --> 01:22:49,360
Um, maybe. Um, so yes, I have played a significant amount more of dead by daylight than

931
01:22:49,360 --> 01:22:56,560
averaged than I usually do. Um, I've, I was supposed to start streaming on midnight Saturday,

932
01:22:56,560 --> 01:23:03,200
which I guess would have technically been the night Sunday morning. But, um, I busted my hand

933
01:23:03,200 --> 01:23:10,000
in a really stupid way. So I don't know those on stream can see them all wrapped up. I, um,

934
01:23:10,720 --> 01:23:16,800
I banged my hand on the door knob in the bathroom chasing after Midna. Oh, because she's a brat.

935
01:23:17,760 --> 01:23:26,720
And I, it kind of felt better, you know, like not as bad because I guess it had gone numb.

936
01:23:27,520 --> 01:23:32,560
And then, um, Friday night I, I went into urgent care and they thought it was broken,

937
01:23:32,560 --> 01:23:38,720
uh, like one of the carpels was broken, but it ended up being a bone bruise. So that was good.

938
01:23:39,280 --> 01:23:44,640
And after resting it all day yesterday, I, I'm probably gonna be back to streaming tonight. Um,

939
01:23:45,440 --> 01:23:52,160
but yeah, lots of dead by daylight. Um, I am working on learning new characters. I might

940
01:23:52,160 --> 01:24:00,080
tackle Hagatha tonight. We'll see. Um, or I might tackle ghost face.

941
01:24:00,720 --> 01:24:04,640
What do you think of the matchmaking they've been testing? Because, um, I know some of the

942
01:24:04,640 --> 01:24:09,280
streamers I watch are kind of like, eh, but I gotta say like for me, like the matches I was,

943
01:24:09,280 --> 01:24:12,880
I don't know if they're still doing it, but like the past couple of days I was playing the matches

944
01:24:12,880 --> 01:24:17,600
I were getting were great. Like I was actually getting matched with people that were like around

945
01:24:17,600 --> 01:24:22,880
my skill. Like I was playing a level one spirit to knock out some type of daily. And I actually

946
01:24:22,880 --> 01:24:27,680
got a noob squad, which for me as a noob spirit, even if I was a level, what, like 13 killer or

947
01:24:27,680 --> 01:24:33,760
whatever I am was, was great. And so I was very happy with that. So I, I hope that met for me.

948
01:24:33,760 --> 01:24:37,280
I thought I was like, Oh, this new metric is great. I'm not getting the bully squad.

949
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:44,320
Yeah. Although I do have to say that beforehand, earlier in the week, I, I did, uh, sacrifice a

950
01:24:44,320 --> 01:24:48,800
rank one survivor and that felt really good. Good job. Good. Congrats. Uh, Ninja, the monkey

951
01:24:48,800 --> 01:24:56,320
and chat with my, my rank 17 self, uh, Ninja, the monkey and chat says, yeah, MMR has been awesome.

952
01:24:56,320 --> 01:25:02,480
Oh, Stella. Hi, Stella. Kitty. You want to play dead by daylight? Kitty. Okay.

953
01:25:03,440 --> 01:25:13,440
But anyway, um, I have, I've been vastly, um, enjoying myself with the, the MMR. Um, I really,

954
01:25:14,720 --> 01:25:21,120
it's nice being able to level with the group that I'm playing with and actually find myself getting

955
01:25:21,120 --> 01:25:29,120
better. Although I'm pretty sure that if I hit, um, what is it that's right before red? Is it

956
01:25:29,120 --> 01:25:35,680
green or purple? Purple? Yeah. I think I would want to stay like right in the purples. Um,

957
01:25:35,680 --> 01:25:44,000
if I make it that far. Um, but, but I did, uh, actually get the full plague outfit from the, uh,

958
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:49,920
the rift. Nice. But I'm not going to use the mask on it because I like seeing her face and

959
01:25:49,920 --> 01:25:57,760
having her be pretty fair enough. And, um, I've been playing board scapes and, um, I'm addicted,

960
01:25:57,760 --> 01:26:03,360
of course, because, you know, me, I'm a word nerd and it's turning right now. And for those

961
01:26:03,360 --> 01:26:11,600
on stream who might see, I am level. I am ranked 10 on the tourney. So that makes me happy.

962
01:26:12,400 --> 01:26:18,080
Even though it's like not worth anything. I like playing the stupid word game. Um,

963
01:26:18,080 --> 01:26:23,760
I'm also playing Fantasia. Of course, that's my Tuesday night stream and I'm super enjoying

964
01:26:23,760 --> 01:26:30,400
Fantasia. Um, the story is getting really good. Um, and for me pacing myself by playing just

965
01:26:30,400 --> 01:26:38,320
little pieces of the story every week has made it kind of like tuning into a TV show a little bit.

966
01:26:38,320 --> 01:26:42,800
I'm picking up the story like that. Fair. Some really, I'm really enjoying Fantasia.

967
01:26:43,680 --> 01:26:49,360
All right. Anything else for your gaming week? Um, no. Um, my gaming week, I've been playing way

968
01:26:49,360 --> 01:26:53,280
too much Final Fantasy 14. What else is new? I actually streamed on my own channel, I think twice

969
01:26:53,360 --> 01:26:59,360
this week. Um, some Final Fantasy 14. Um, and my Ninja hit level 80. That didn't happen on stream.

970
01:26:59,360 --> 01:27:02,960
I think that happened yesterday. I wasn't streaming. Uh, but yeah, so I, I got another,

971
01:27:02,960 --> 01:27:08,240
another class to 80. So I only have, I think three more to go. Black Mage, Monk, Warrior,

972
01:27:08,240 --> 01:27:12,880
I think is all I have that's left. So, um, that'll be, that'll be fun. I'm gonna work on that. That's

973
01:27:12,880 --> 01:27:20,320
for sure. Um, and then, uh, let's see, what else did I check out? Um, I also have been playing Dead

974
01:27:20,320 --> 01:27:26,480
by Daylight. Um, here's the crazy thing. Okay. So like, I got into Dead by Daylight to play Killer

975
01:27:26,480 --> 01:27:31,120
because I was like, I don't know if I can play Survivor. The heartbeat stuff messes with me. I

976
01:27:31,120 --> 01:27:34,640
don't know if I can do it, but then I just kind of like, I don't know. I was like, just get over it

977
01:27:34,640 --> 01:27:39,680
and play Survivor. And I did. And I've been playing Survivor. I'm up to rank seven on Survivor.

978
01:27:40,400 --> 01:27:46,320
Alan is not ranked seven. And I'm not saying that to rub it in, but I'm also saying it in a way to

979
01:27:46,320 --> 01:27:51,680
be like, how did I do this? I don't deserve, I don't deserve it because like, I don't, I only

980
01:27:51,680 --> 01:27:57,120
have Dwight's talents, Meg's talents. Those are the only two characters I've gotten to 40. And

981
01:27:57,120 --> 01:28:01,040
then I have some of the stuff that's been in the Shrine of Secrets, like the, a couple of Bill

982
01:28:01,040 --> 01:28:05,120
talents, um, and maybe one other Survivor talent I grabbed from there. The Bill talents are pretty

983
01:28:05,120 --> 01:28:10,400
good. The Bill talents are very necessary, but, um, I have to throw this out here. Me who has never

984
01:28:10,400 --> 01:28:16,080
played Survivor and has zero intent to play Survivor anytime soon. I bought Pebble.

985
01:28:17,760 --> 01:28:20,320
That was the other talent that I got, was the Pebble. Yeah.

986
01:28:20,320 --> 01:28:22,960
I had to buy Pebble just because.

987
01:28:22,960 --> 01:28:27,360
Um, but, uh, yeah. So I've been, I've been working on leveling up my Survivors,

988
01:28:27,360 --> 01:28:30,960
but I don't know how the hell I hit rank seven. I really don't. Um, because I'm,

989
01:28:30,960 --> 01:28:36,480
I'm terrible at looping killers still. It's like my big weak spot, but I am pretty good at not

990
01:28:36,480 --> 01:28:43,360
being found. That's where I'm, you know, uh, I I'm, I'm pretty good at the stealthy part of things.

991
01:28:43,360 --> 01:28:47,680
Like I'm good at like working on a generator. Then like, as soon as like, I know the killer's close,

992
01:28:47,680 --> 01:28:53,200
like crawling away around the wall and then out the window so that they can't see me, you know,

993
01:28:53,200 --> 01:28:58,320
tiptoeing out the back doors. They can't see that I was there. Um, do you have David?

994
01:28:59,360 --> 01:29:01,840
That's the character I'm working on now. So David is level 28.

995
01:29:02,400 --> 01:29:10,560
Uh, you need, you need the no short cosmetic because I have an aesthetic game crush on dabs.

996
01:29:10,560 --> 01:29:16,800
Yeah. He's, uh, and I call him dabs because he's British and that's a very valid nickname for David.

997
01:29:17,360 --> 01:29:22,400
Um, but I've been getting random dailies. So I actually got Nia up to like six or seven because

998
01:29:22,400 --> 01:29:27,040
I had two dailies for Nia. So I kind of had to do it. Um, and then I, I think I had somebody else.

999
01:29:27,040 --> 01:29:32,320
I mean, the new entity. Yes. Yes. The new entity. Uh, so that's been my dead by daylight. I have

1000
01:29:32,320 --> 01:29:38,480
yet to stream that game, but I will, I will, I will break the seal on that soon. Uh, I just,

1001
01:29:39,520 --> 01:29:43,760
that will be when I play survivor. I will play with you. All right. All right. That'll be good.

1002
01:29:43,760 --> 01:29:48,960
I'm waiting for Jill. Well, I want to be, I want to be the totem bitch. So you're waiting

1003
01:29:48,960 --> 01:29:56,400
until Tuesday. Yeah. Pretty much maybe. Um, so yes, there's that. Uh, Ninja, the monkey says,

1004
01:29:56,400 --> 01:30:01,120
come play with us, Rob. I will, but please, please keep in mind I'm ranked seven, but I'm not good.

1005
01:30:01,120 --> 01:30:06,400
Okay. So as long as we all have that expectation, then yes, I'll play. It's fine. All right. Um,

1006
01:30:06,400 --> 01:30:10,640
let's see what else, uh, for my gaming week. Oh, I should talk about something new. So I played,

1007
01:30:10,640 --> 01:30:18,400
um, on Xbox series X fantasy star online to new Genesis came out this week. Um, and so I downloaded

1008
01:30:18,400 --> 01:30:23,680
that and I checked that out. I'm not very far into it where my opinions are really full fledged

1009
01:30:23,680 --> 01:30:27,840
right now. So I don't, I'm not going to really give you like these, this is my final thought.

1010
01:30:27,840 --> 01:30:33,280
It is also struggling a little bit with a lot of the things that every new MMO goes through. And

1011
01:30:33,280 --> 01:30:39,600
that is lag servers are getting hit crazy, you know, that sort of thing. So I'm, I'm going to

1012
01:30:39,600 --> 01:30:43,040
give them the benefit of the doubt and a little more time to work that stuff out, especially

1013
01:30:43,040 --> 01:30:47,680
cause the game is free. Um, this isn't like a game I paid $60 for like, you know, the mass effect

1014
01:30:48,160 --> 01:30:54,640
remaster, uh, where they're still patching it. Um, so, uh, yeah. Fantasy star online to new Genesis.

1015
01:30:54,640 --> 01:31:00,560
I do like that this, uh, the, the prologue that I've been playing, I think makes for a much better

1016
01:31:00,560 --> 01:31:07,200
tutorial than throwing 10,000 quests at you like original fantasy star online to does. Um, the only

1017
01:31:07,200 --> 01:31:12,080
downside I can really think of is that I tried to make a new character, man. There's some ugly

1018
01:31:12,080 --> 01:31:16,000
characters in that game. There's I could not make a good looking character. So I went, I,

1019
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:20,720
you can import like your PSO two character and that's what I did. And that looked much better.

1020
01:31:20,720 --> 01:31:25,760
So, uh, yeah. So I was playing a little bit of that and, uh, I'll give you a more fully

1021
01:31:25,760 --> 01:31:29,680
real light cause I'm only like level four or five. So, and I feel like I'm still a tutorial,

1022
01:31:29,680 --> 01:31:33,920
so I don't really have full fledged opinions yet. Um, but that is a game I'm, I've been sinking a

1023
01:31:33,920 --> 01:31:39,600
little bit of time into. Um, although I lost a good 15, 20 minutes of progress because apparently

1024
01:31:39,600 --> 01:31:44,960
if you don't get to a certain point in the prologue, you roll all the way back to an

1025
01:31:44,960 --> 01:31:49,120
important story, story points that kind of irritated me, but it is what it is.

1026
01:31:49,120 --> 01:31:55,280
So that was my gaming week. All right. Uh, I know we usually do, uh, the gaming week at the top of

1027
01:31:55,280 --> 01:31:59,920
the show, but we had all of that, uh, you know, E3 and summer game Fest news that now we're to

1028
01:31:59,920 --> 01:32:05,040
the point of the show where we're going to get into this very familiar, lovely segment. Let's

1029
01:32:05,040 --> 01:32:21,920
do the bump. And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault

1030
01:32:21,920 --> 01:32:27,280
and pull out a classic and tell you about it. It's time for the classic game of the week.

1031
01:32:27,280 --> 01:32:32,720
But I believe dark soccer is putting a twist on it this week, right? Dark soccer.

1032
01:32:33,600 --> 01:32:40,880
I am. We're, we're doing this thing. All right. Tell us about it. It's a flag.

1033
01:32:40,880 --> 01:32:47,440
A flag. And here it is. What's the, uh, for those who don't know, flag is a fucking weird

1034
01:32:47,440 --> 01:32:55,600
arcade game. And I have picked a ticket spitter because it's fucking weird. The game is called

1035
01:32:55,680 --> 01:33:00,800
stinky feet. There's not really a whole lot to say, to say about this one. Um, you can have

1036
01:33:00,800 --> 01:33:08,160
either a single player mode or a four person mode, but basically you sit on a toilet seat

1037
01:33:08,800 --> 01:33:13,360
and you fire water. Oh, I didn't even see that there was a toilet seat you sat on because

1038
01:33:13,360 --> 01:33:17,200
whoever filmed this YouTube lovely put their finger over the lens. A little,

1039
01:33:17,200 --> 01:33:24,480
a little crazy anyway. Sorry. But anyway, you fire water at these people stinky ass feet

1040
01:33:24,480 --> 01:33:29,760
and these people are holding their own nose in the bathtub and you are shooting water at their,

1041
01:33:29,760 --> 01:33:36,720
at their stink ass feet while you're sitting on a toilet who puts their fucking toilet in front of

1042
01:33:36,720 --> 01:33:46,080
their tub. I mean, really, that's kind of stupid, but anyway, it's a stupid game. It's fucking weird

1043
01:33:46,080 --> 01:33:57,200
game and it's put out by, uh, Betson. Um, I believe, oh, maybe that's just who's, who's

1044
01:33:57,200 --> 01:34:07,760
trying to sell it, but, um, it's, it's just fucking weird. I have nothing else I can say

1045
01:34:07,760 --> 01:34:11,600
about it other than it's fucking weird. What Loki you sound like you have a comment on this.

1046
01:34:12,560 --> 01:34:18,240
I had to ask if you're sitting on a toilet seat and spraying something at feet, is it

1047
01:34:20,880 --> 01:34:25,600
is it dark? Sakura, the $10,000 question of the week. Is it P

1048
01:34:28,240 --> 01:34:33,600
bitch? Maybe I have to read the blurb though from this, so I'm just going to read it verbatim. Okay.

1049
01:34:34,640 --> 01:34:41,280
It's fun, exciting, different and simple. Gameplay that works. Stinky feet is a hilarious

1050
01:34:41,440 --> 01:34:46,640
multi target water race game that is great for all ages. And do you know how those feet got stinky?

1051
01:34:48,400 --> 01:34:55,360
Let me finish doing my cutesy announcer voice, please. Yes. Thank you. Follow the light pattern

1052
01:34:55,360 --> 01:35:01,360
to win. It has a unique bathtub theme. Every gun is a replica of a bathtub faucet and the seats

1053
01:35:01,360 --> 01:35:10,640
resemble toilets. You can also link five to 12 units. I don't know how many people

1054
01:35:14,720 --> 01:35:18,320
like a stinky family feet. Where do you come from? Resident evil seven.

1055
01:35:20,720 --> 01:35:25,440
All right. Um, let's get some of the comments on this segment from our chat room. Uh,

1056
01:35:25,440 --> 01:35:31,040
in no particular order, we have the heck what is happening? I need an adult. What the fuck?

1057
01:35:31,040 --> 01:35:37,600
Okay. Then I need an adult in all caps. I can't even carnival game. Good Lord. He, he, he,

1058
01:35:37,600 --> 01:35:42,560
and it's actually not water. It's light, but you pretend dark soccer. Your look is giving

1059
01:35:42,560 --> 01:35:47,760
me Kathy Griffin vibes. There you go. I am. Yeah, I think that's a compliment.

1060
01:35:48,320 --> 01:35:53,760
I can't go bad with that. No way. Although I am holding, I'll look at the camera cause I'm wearing

1061
01:35:53,760 --> 01:36:00,800
my ACE pride makeup. Um, and while she's doing that, uh, dark Tetsuya says didn't ever expect

1062
01:36:00,800 --> 01:36:05,040
flag of the month to go this way. Do you, do you know what this, do you know what the segment is?

1063
01:36:05,840 --> 01:36:08,960
Are you new here? Are you new here? Dark, dark Tetsuya.

1064
01:36:11,440 --> 01:36:15,760
It's called the fucking arcade game of the month. I almost did a game called shoot the poop,

1065
01:36:15,760 --> 01:36:20,800
but I'm not going to do that one. Uh, and VG realness who paid you the, uh,

1066
01:36:20,800 --> 01:36:25,840
Kathy Griffin compliment has a followed up with gorge in response to your makeup.

1067
01:36:25,840 --> 01:36:30,000
Thank you. How about that? All right. I'll send you some Oreos.

1068
01:36:31,200 --> 01:36:36,000
There it is. You're fucking weird arcade game of the month. That's a thing. Cause Canada doesn't

1069
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:40,400
have the crazy flavors we do, right? That's for the record. I have to digress a little bit and

1070
01:36:40,400 --> 01:36:50,400
talk about these Thai Lay's chips that I got that are chestnut flavored. They're sweet. Oh wow.

1071
01:36:50,960 --> 01:36:55,840
Fucking delicious. Sounds good. I'll get you some. All right. Yeah. And I don't know what,

1072
01:36:55,840 --> 01:36:59,920
what kind of get you. I just remember I can't get you anything with peanut butter. Right. So,

1073
01:37:01,280 --> 01:37:06,400
um, there's a million flavors at the store. Lemon cream, I think right now. Oh yeah. Yeah.

1074
01:37:06,960 --> 01:37:09,280
Now they're getting the point where they're kind of cycling through the same flavors.

1075
01:37:09,280 --> 01:37:13,520
They won't really see new ones anymore. So yeah, but I don't think I ever sent you lemon,

1076
01:37:13,520 --> 01:37:18,640
so we'll have to work on that one. All right. Uh, my, I think a really good one right now is

1077
01:37:18,640 --> 01:37:21,440
that there's like a strawberry one. Is it strawberry donut or something like that?

1078
01:37:21,440 --> 01:37:24,960
It's a pretty good one. Yeah. It was like a strawberry donut one. I haven't tried that.

1079
01:37:24,960 --> 01:37:29,840
Okay. So I don't know. That might be gone by now, but anyway, uh, one thing I wanted to say,

1080
01:37:29,840 --> 01:37:33,200
by the way, before we get back into rapid fire news. So I was checking out while, um,

1081
01:37:33,200 --> 01:37:36,800
we, some of you guys were talking and doing the segment, I was checking out this arcade cabinet.

1082
01:37:36,800 --> 01:37:41,600
If you missed, uh, about 30 minutes ago, Alan brought in this mini, uh, Street Fighter two

1083
01:37:41,600 --> 01:37:46,960
arcade cab into the studio. And I was like, why does it have this giant ass wire to plug in?

1084
01:37:46,960 --> 01:37:50,080
Well, the deal is, and it's on the back of the box. I don't know if you can see it.

1085
01:37:50,720 --> 01:37:55,920
You can actually hook two of these machines together through the wire. Cause it's street

1086
01:37:55,920 --> 01:38:02,240
fighter. Right? So, and it only has one joy. So it actually has a link cable. It has a link cable,

1087
01:38:02,240 --> 01:38:06,560
like it's a fucking game boy. Oh my goodness. So you link the two machines together, right?

1088
01:38:07,360 --> 01:38:13,600
So there you go. I don't know if it's $50 worth of rad for a game that, you know, but it is,

1089
01:38:13,600 --> 01:38:18,400
it is bigger. So if you remember the mini cabs that are at my house, this is definitely bigger.

1090
01:38:18,400 --> 01:38:22,560
I don't know. Like they actually, they don't just have the screen, but they have that whole

1091
01:38:22,560 --> 01:38:27,040
decoration that shows all the world warriors like around it. So that's kind of, Oh, it's champion

1092
01:38:27,040 --> 01:38:33,600
edition. So I get to play the, uh, bosses too. That's kind of cool. Yeah. Wow. Head to head play

1093
01:38:33,600 --> 01:38:38,240
by linking two devices. I can't believe 20, 20, 21. And my husband just bought me a device with

1094
01:38:38,240 --> 01:38:44,800
the link cable. Love it. All right. Anyhow, uh, let's get into some rapid fire news. So believe

1095
01:38:44,800 --> 01:38:48,800
it or not, we had all of these announcements, announcements, announcements, uh, from digital

1096
01:38:48,800 --> 01:38:52,080
media events, but there were other things that happened in the industry too. Let's talk about

1097
01:38:52,080 --> 01:38:55,520
some of them pretty quickly here. Loki, I think you have a couple of quick, quick headlines,

1098
01:38:55,520 --> 01:39:01,760
right? Yes. Uh, so game builder garages have mentioned came out this week and they do have

1099
01:39:01,760 --> 01:39:06,720
a demo available on the switch. So if you want to check it out, you probably should do that.

1100
01:39:06,720 --> 01:39:11,520
Cause it looks pretty awesome. I have yet to recreate pixel hoops number two in it yet.

1101
01:39:12,160 --> 01:39:21,840
Um, but that may be coming because why not? Um, and then, um, well, yeah, hopefully you can

1102
01:39:21,840 --> 01:39:26,400
download the demo because they've had a recent firmware update that actually prevents, uh,

1103
01:39:26,400 --> 01:39:35,440
downloading games after the update. Um, there are some errors with it, but, um, I don't know if it's

1104
01:39:35,440 --> 01:39:43,680
a lot of systems that were affected by it, but, you know, hopefully they will be, um, getting

1105
01:39:43,680 --> 01:39:49,280
that updated soon. I think I saw Flaco tweeting about that. Oh, sorry. Flaco hope you're able to

1106
01:39:49,280 --> 01:39:58,480
fix it. Yeah. So, um, keep out, keep an eye out for that. And then, um, last but not least also,

1107
01:39:58,480 --> 01:40:02,480
there was some announcements during the summer games fest, um, talking about, you know,

1108
01:40:02,480 --> 01:40:08,080
Netflix series again that they have, um, the cuphead series don't deal with the devil

1109
01:40:08,080 --> 01:40:13,520
that Wayne Brady is going to be King dice in that, which I think is some pretty good casting

1110
01:40:13,520 --> 01:40:19,920
actually. Um, it looks interesting. So we'll check that out when that, uh, series eventually

1111
01:40:19,920 --> 01:40:23,760
hits Netflix. Yeah. That cuphead series looks pretty cool. I mean, which of course the game

1112
01:40:23,760 --> 01:40:27,280
has amazing art direction. It lends itself very well to a show like that. So it looked very,

1113
01:40:27,280 --> 01:40:30,880
very cool to me. Well, it's based off old cartoons. So it makes sense that, you know,

1114
01:40:30,880 --> 01:40:35,920
yeah, it looks like an old cartoon now. Exactly. A new old cartoon, uh, dark Sakura. How about

1115
01:40:35,920 --> 01:40:43,520
you? What do you have for us? Oh, a couple of things. Um, so, uh, oh my God, I just completely

1116
01:40:43,520 --> 01:40:51,360
lost where I was. So today there was a really, really fun dead by daylight tournament. Um,

1117
01:40:52,080 --> 01:41:00,720
it was called raft con. It was organized by, uh, hydro. Um, and, uh, it was just really,

1118
01:41:00,720 --> 01:41:04,800
really a lot of fun. It was all for charity. It was a raising money for the Trevor project,

1119
01:41:04,800 --> 01:41:10,960
which they exceeded $2,000. I want to say it was something like around 2100,

1120
01:41:10,960 --> 01:41:15,520
a little bit past that. Um, and it was really exciting. I mean, it was, I mean,

1121
01:41:15,520 --> 01:41:20,640
if you're into depth by daylight, that is, it was, there was some kind of real male biter moments.

1122
01:41:20,640 --> 01:41:27,920
Um, and, uh, it ended up, uh, killer side, uh, losing color one, which honestly, I don't think

1123
01:41:27,920 --> 01:41:32,800
anyone was really surprised about that one. He's, he's pretty hardcore. Awesome. A nurse.

1124
01:41:33,440 --> 01:41:41,440
I heard he had to do a pretty big match as hag though. Yes. So this one, well, it was the finals,

1125
01:41:41,440 --> 01:41:47,680
the start of the finals, which were two matches, uh, each, uh, the other one in the finals was,

1126
01:41:47,680 --> 01:41:56,240
uh, Laurie bird, who also was, uh, a nurse main. And, uh, they had, uh, Hawkins,

1127
01:41:57,200 --> 01:42:02,640
which is terrible for nurse, right? I mean, it's also terrible for a lot of people, but I digress.

1128
01:42:02,640 --> 01:42:12,080
Um, so losing color went, uh, the path of hag, which worked out great. And, uh,

1129
01:42:12,720 --> 01:42:21,040
Laurie bird went the path of twins that worked out not so great. Um, but the, uh, the survivor team

1130
01:42:21,040 --> 01:42:30,640
that one was, uh, the mod squad, which, um, honestly, everybody did such a good, uh, a good

1131
01:42:30,640 --> 01:42:37,760
job. Haslin's team did a really good job. I was really impressed by just the overall skill. And

1132
01:42:37,760 --> 01:42:42,800
this would be like, if I were better at the game, this is the kind of matches I would want to do

1133
01:42:42,800 --> 01:42:50,000
because they're just really engrossing and just really fun to participate in. And I, I, I had

1134
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:53,760
a great time watching. I was really invested. I hope they put some of the highlights up on

1135
01:42:53,760 --> 01:42:57,680
YouTube. My only complaint, and I understand why they did it today because it's pride month and

1136
01:42:57,680 --> 01:43:02,000
everything, but my only complaint is that they chose the E three day to do it. And it's like,

1137
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:05,200
there's all these big pressers and I've got, I've got to pay attention to them, right? I have

1138
01:43:05,200 --> 01:43:08,960
nothing to talk about tonight. Um, so I hope some of those matches are on YouTube because I'd still

1139
01:43:08,960 --> 01:43:14,960
love to be able to support it somehow. It was like 65 different, um, streamers involved in it.

1140
01:43:14,960 --> 01:43:23,200
And like some of the people who, I mean, I watch regularly, uh, mithril onion, um, a good streamer,

1141
01:43:23,440 --> 01:43:31,200
King Bay, you watch all 65. I don't watch all of them. Uh, are you sure I, again, you guys,

1142
01:43:31,200 --> 01:43:37,040
I cannot go in to a dead by daylight channel and not suddenly see dark soccer pipe up and chat.

1143
01:43:37,040 --> 01:43:40,560
I might even be like, who's this new person I've never watched before. Oh, this is an interesting

1144
01:43:40,560 --> 01:43:45,440
stream. And then all of a sudden dark soccer, OLR, like, hi, good play or whatever comment

1145
01:43:45,440 --> 01:43:50,240
she's making. I'm like, my God, she's everywhere. No, but I, I say that with love. You know,

1146
01:43:50,240 --> 01:43:52,960
I say that with absolute and total love. I love that you're so into it.

1147
01:43:53,680 --> 01:43:57,840
Well, I mean, but like a lot of the ones in here that are, that I'm like the most

1148
01:43:57,840 --> 01:44:03,520
hangout in would be like Kilcannon and King Bay and, uh, uh, Twilight King, Nick and Prince.

1149
01:44:03,520 --> 01:44:09,200
I mean, just really, but I was really impressed as far as the survivors go. And not just because

1150
01:44:09,200 --> 01:44:16,400
I really enjoy watching Le Pen and think he's a fantastic just person, but the way Le Pen did,

1151
01:44:16,400 --> 01:44:22,480
uh, Kate and was so good at hiding and not being found at all.

1152
01:44:22,480 --> 01:44:24,880
Ah, that's, that's, that's my style. Yeah. I love that.

1153
01:44:25,440 --> 01:44:31,280
Yeah. I was really impressed. Um, and still being able to, to participate with other,

1154
01:44:31,280 --> 01:44:35,200
you know, go to do rescues, do gens, do everything. So I was pretty impressed.

1155
01:44:35,200 --> 01:44:38,640
Dark soccer. Will you help me convince Chad Starsick to play the game already?

1156
01:44:41,360 --> 01:44:43,680
Well, it's on game pass. He can play it.

1157
01:44:43,680 --> 01:44:49,200
I I'm actually kind of floored that, that he's not.

1158
01:44:49,200 --> 01:44:51,520
Yeah, I know. I know. All right.

1159
01:44:52,080 --> 01:44:55,360
But anyway, um, the last thing I'm going to say about this is congrats to,

1160
01:44:55,360 --> 01:45:01,280
to everybody who participated. Thank you for doing such good work for charity and putting

1161
01:45:01,280 --> 01:45:07,280
on an amazing show. Thank you to Hydro for, for organizing everything. And I,

1162
01:45:07,280 --> 01:45:14,720
I really am just so impressed. I really love the way the communities come together for great cause.

1163
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:19,520
Um, props to everybody. Yeah. A lot of names I recognize too.

1164
01:45:21,200 --> 01:45:27,600
The next thing is, is pertinent to my interest because her. So there's a new

1165
01:45:27,600 --> 01:45:32,160
Castlevania series that Netflix is going to release that stars Richter Belmont,

1166
01:45:32,160 --> 01:45:36,880
which makes me super happy because then it's all Dracula X, uh, stuff. So of course,

1167
01:45:37,040 --> 01:45:43,680
there's Maria Renard, um, who is, uh, his sister-in-law cause you know, he,

1168
01:45:43,680 --> 01:45:49,280
and well, and Richter is a descendant of Saifa and Trevor. I mean, cause all the rest of the

1169
01:45:49,280 --> 01:45:58,720
Belmonts are, so I am really hoping just the whole thing is, uh, Dracula X related. I mean,

1170
01:45:58,720 --> 01:46:04,960
I don't know if we're going to have little Maria, which would be funny cause they, um,

1171
01:46:05,120 --> 01:46:10,880
and of course the, all thing is, is during the French revolution as well. Um, but I'm just super,

1172
01:46:10,880 --> 01:46:17,840
super happy because Richter is my, my favorite Belmont and the Dracula X and Dracula XX

1173
01:46:17,840 --> 01:46:22,400
Nocturne in the Moonlight. Those are like two of my favorite games.

1174
01:46:24,480 --> 01:46:29,120
All right. Lots of good stuff, lots of good stuff in that Netflix event. That's for sure.

1175
01:46:29,840 --> 01:46:34,400
All right. Let's go travel around the world and check out some games that are coming out

1176
01:46:34,400 --> 01:46:40,160
this week in world release dates. Uh, Loki, I had one more thing to mention. My bad. Go for it.

1177
01:46:40,160 --> 01:46:47,840
Yeah. Cause I had forgotten to, um, it has been confirmed from a release by steel series. Um,

1178
01:46:48,800 --> 01:46:54,960
that for the resident evil chapter for dead by daylight, it has confirmed that, uh, there are

1179
01:46:54,960 --> 01:47:03,440
legendary, uh, cosmetics for Leon and Jill that will have, uh, uh, Chris, uh, and Claire.

1180
01:47:04,320 --> 01:47:11,920
Oh, cool. Yeah. So they, they are con it had been hinted before dbd leaks, uh, made a mention of it,

1181
01:47:12,640 --> 01:47:18,960
but, um, steel series, let the whole cat out of the bag that it's, uh, they're legendaries.

1182
01:47:18,960 --> 01:47:24,000
We'll get maybe, maybe Shane getting to play as Chris. Maybe we'll finally break them. Who knows?

1183
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:27,440
And I'll just read it says the resident evil collection available via the end game store

1184
01:47:27,440 --> 01:47:32,640
includes two legendary sets for Leon and Jill that bring Chris and Claire Redfield into the fog.

1185
01:47:33,680 --> 01:47:37,600
Which version of Chris, apparently this is very important to Shane. I would imagine it's the re

1186
01:47:37,600 --> 01:47:40,960
two remake, right? Cause that's, that's what the nemesis are based off of. Right?

1187
01:47:41,600 --> 01:47:49,040
Well, I mean, Chris wasn't in re two, so it would probably be, um, I would reckon the first one,

1188
01:47:49,040 --> 01:47:54,800
but I mean, but keep in mind they're, they're going to do more and more cosmetics for it.

1189
01:47:54,800 --> 01:48:02,000
So I'm sure we would get a village Chris before too long. All right. So you can get your gruff

1190
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:12,080
buff and a tough, uh, grizzled, uh, daddy, Chris. All right. I'm just going to call him daddy, Chris.

1191
01:48:12,080 --> 01:48:17,040
Let's travel around the world and check out some release dates. Uh, we'll start in the U S Loki.

1192
01:48:17,680 --> 01:48:23,360
It's a slow week. It was a huge week this last week. So yeah. And really,

1193
01:48:23,360 --> 01:48:28,720
we're only getting two games that are being ported over to the, um, the new gen systems.

1194
01:48:28,720 --> 01:48:33,760
So we've got, uh, the elder scrolls online. It's getting a dedicated PlayStation five and

1195
01:48:33,760 --> 01:48:39,280
Xbox series X version and Metro Exodus complete edition is also coming to PlayStation five and

1196
01:48:39,280 --> 01:48:44,480
Xbox series X. That's it. Uh, it looks a little light in Japan this week as well. Uh,

1197
01:48:44,480 --> 01:48:50,320
Japan is getting a game on the switch called Bakumatsu Orenka Shin segumi, uh, is out this

1198
01:48:50,320 --> 01:48:56,160
week. And I am not familiar with this franchise. It is from D three. Is that Shinsengumi? Uh, yeah.

1199
01:48:56,160 --> 01:49:00,960
All one word. Yeah. Yeah. So she's saying, uh, so it's a new, I think based off of a newer

1200
01:49:00,960 --> 01:49:07,040
anime series, I've seen some cosplay stuff out for it yet, but I mean, the Shinsengumi

1201
01:49:07,040 --> 01:49:13,120
was like a real group, like during the, the whole Meiji period. Um, and there's like,

1202
01:49:13,120 --> 01:49:17,440
they've been in like a bajillion anime, manga, comic books, just different iterations of

1203
01:49:17,440 --> 01:49:21,840
characters based on Shinsengumi. Looking at this description too, it looks like this is an older

1204
01:49:21,840 --> 01:49:26,000
release. That's kind of like a high res for the switch. So it's kind of like a rerelease for

1205
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:31,040
switch because yeah, then when I look at the PlayStation four, it's pretty dry this week and

1206
01:49:31,040 --> 01:49:37,440
the PlayStation five in Japan this week, uh, that red controller, uh, is out. Uh, but that's really

1207
01:49:37,440 --> 01:49:42,160
it it's otherwise it's a very slow week in Japan as well. How about the UK dark soccer? Is any

1208
01:49:42,160 --> 01:49:49,040
different there? Eh, not really. Um, so what we have, oh gosh, I scrolled too far because, uh,

1209
01:49:49,040 --> 01:49:55,680
British States are a little bit different than how ours are listed. So, um, what we have is on

1210
01:49:55,680 --> 01:50:03,760
the 17th, we have rogue book for PC. On the 18th, we have Vader immortal, a star Wars VR series.

1211
01:50:04,400 --> 01:50:12,400
And, uh, that's about it. Excellent. All right. Uh, let's get a few more stories in here. Some

1212
01:50:12,400 --> 01:50:17,120
other things going on. Um, I guess this next story is kind of about E3, right Loki, but it's,

1213
01:50:17,120 --> 01:50:23,440
it's something everybody's talking about. It's really stupid. Um, it's, it, I, I think it's the

1214
01:50:23,440 --> 01:50:31,600
authentic E3 experience, but at home. So we've complained about E3 in the past and how you have

1215
01:50:31,600 --> 01:50:36,800
media credentials, but you're not really media because they're, you know, only going to let

1216
01:50:36,800 --> 01:50:42,560
certain media outlets look at this stuff. Well, that's what, um, the ESA is basically saying

1217
01:50:43,440 --> 01:50:51,200
regarding, uh, co-streaming some of the E3 events is that they have a short list of exclusive, uh,

1218
01:50:51,760 --> 01:50:58,400
well, basically folks that are approved to, you know, actually broadcast that stuff and that,

1219
01:50:58,400 --> 01:51:04,880
um, they don't really authorize anybody else to do it. I'm thinking that it could be that

1220
01:51:04,880 --> 01:51:09,520
they're white listing those so that they don't get copyright claimed, or maybe it could be just that,

1221
01:51:10,320 --> 01:51:14,400
you know, they want to be responsible for if you're co-streaming and you get,

1222
01:51:14,400 --> 01:51:19,840
you know, DMCA copyright claimed or something like that, but you can hold the ESA responsible,

1223
01:51:19,840 --> 01:51:26,400
like anyone would actually think to do that. But I don't know. To me, it seems like it's more of just

1224
01:51:26,400 --> 01:51:34,880
like, you know, they, um, they're being dicks. Well, E3 is just behind the curve. You get the

1225
01:51:34,880 --> 01:51:39,760
sense that the ESA is not run by people that are current on their technology. And that is very,

1226
01:51:39,760 --> 01:51:44,160
this is something I've called them out on before is that for the type of organization they are,

1227
01:51:44,160 --> 01:51:47,920
they should know their shit when it comes to technology. And it really feels like they don't.

1228
01:51:47,920 --> 01:51:54,240
And it's very frustrating because am I, am I, am I incorrect that they leaked more data again from

1229
01:51:54,240 --> 01:52:00,480
their registration database this time? I thought I heard that was the thing this year. Chat,

1230
01:52:00,480 --> 01:52:06,480
please feel free to jump in and help me recall. Um, yeah, I don't remember if that happened,

1231
01:52:06,480 --> 01:52:10,480
but they basically black compat says yes. And as she says, they did. That's what I thought.

1232
01:52:10,480 --> 01:52:13,040
And so it's one of those things where it's like, well, thank God, I didn't sign up to be your

1233
01:52:13,040 --> 01:52:16,640
partner to stream. Cause you would have just given out my address. You would have doxed me

1234
01:52:16,640 --> 01:52:24,000
in exchange. So it's like, I, the ESA just needs to grow the fuck up in a lot of ways. I know that

1235
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:29,760
sounds very rude. Um, and yeah, it's rude. Um, because I think for what they're supposed to be

1236
01:52:29,760 --> 01:52:34,000
for this industry, it's very frustrating that they're just, they're lagging behind and all

1237
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:39,600
these different ways. Like wake up, have you ever watched a Twitch stream ESA? Do you know what

1238
01:52:39,600 --> 01:52:43,680
co-streaming is? Here's, here's what they said. They made it, maybe they're walking it back a

1239
01:52:43,680 --> 01:52:48,480
little bit, but they said that basically that there was over 1300 submissions. They only

1240
01:52:48,480 --> 01:52:55,600
approved less than a hundred creators for the brands for official co-streaming. They said that

1241
01:52:55,600 --> 01:53:00,880
the, um, unauthorized streams are still welcome to co-stream, but it won't be in the official

1242
01:53:00,880 --> 01:53:07,200
capacity, whatever that means. So the, so it is less about being concerned about the DMCA and

1243
01:53:07,200 --> 01:53:14,080
more of them being dicks. I mean, that's really, they just completely made that clear is that.

1244
01:53:14,720 --> 01:53:19,360
I, I also, I also think it's ridiculous that like, you know, they had to have, okay. So like,

1245
01:53:19,360 --> 01:53:23,920
let's say the Square Enix thing was streamed on Twitch gaming, but they had to strip out all the

1246
01:53:23,920 --> 01:53:28,080
licensed music for the Twitch gaming thing because the musical industry might come after them

1247
01:53:28,080 --> 01:53:34,320
otherwise. Like we need to then stop putting, stop helping the music industry by putting licensed

1248
01:53:34,320 --> 01:53:41,360
music in trailers. Like I want to see the game industry fight the fuck back, like stop putting

1249
01:53:41,360 --> 01:53:44,480
licensed music in trailers, then fine. You don't want us to use your music. We won't use it.

1250
01:53:45,280 --> 01:53:50,480
And I, they need to push back on that stuff because it's ridiculous. Like what the music,

1251
01:53:50,480 --> 01:53:54,240
and, and I said this a little bit on Bobby show. I think the thing that pisses me off the most,

1252
01:53:54,240 --> 01:53:57,680
I swear to God, if I ever ran for public office, which I don't think I would ever do,

1253
01:53:57,680 --> 01:54:03,680
but, um, I, I, this would be the, I would ban these bot claims. I would say robots should not

1254
01:54:03,680 --> 01:54:09,440
be filing copyright claims. People should be filing copyright claims because that way you can

1255
01:54:09,440 --> 01:54:14,800
measure intent. And I think that's a huge part of what this is. Like, yes, if you're running a

1256
01:54:14,800 --> 01:54:18,560
stream where you're willfully just like playing music on demand and all this stuff, then you

1257
01:54:18,560 --> 01:54:23,920
probably should be stricken down and not be on Twitch. But you know what? Oh my God, I accidentally

1258
01:54:23,920 --> 01:54:28,480
played, you know, Grand Theft Auto and streamed like two seconds of a Guns N' Roses song or

1259
01:54:28,480 --> 01:54:32,400
something. Like you should not lose your whole fucking wellbeing online because something like

1260
01:54:32,400 --> 01:54:37,840
that. We need reform on this law. What do you think got me into making my own music?

1261
01:54:38,160 --> 01:54:42,960
We have a government that can't do shit right now. And it's so far like, I'm like, well,

1262
01:54:42,960 --> 01:54:45,200
we need the government to solve the copyright, but they're not going to.

1263
01:54:46,080 --> 01:54:51,760
No, this is, they're not going to, especially when it works out for them. I mean,

1264
01:54:52,720 --> 01:54:57,520
it's just, it's just stupid. Anyway. Um, let's see. Um, Chad starts again,

1265
01:54:57,520 --> 01:55:00,160
chat says stripping out the music from the guardians of the galaxy trailer would have

1266
01:55:00,160 --> 01:55:05,280
taken like 50% of the neatness away from it. Guess what? I saw it without any of the music

1267
01:55:05,280 --> 01:55:11,680
because I was watching on the, um, Twitch gaming thing. So I didn't see it with the music.

1268
01:55:11,680 --> 01:55:17,040
What they should do is replace all. They should have a database of really bad recorder

1269
01:55:17,680 --> 01:55:27,040
covers of all of these songs and just replace them all. Let's see. So, uh,

1270
01:55:27,040 --> 01:55:31,760
as she went into Matt is also clarifying what happened with the, the press information on the

1271
01:55:31,760 --> 01:55:37,200
press site for E3, you can search fellow press people and look at their profile that had their

1272
01:55:37,200 --> 01:55:42,160
personal info like phone numbers, personal emails, et cetera. Oh, cause I'm sure nobody

1273
01:55:42,160 --> 01:55:48,240
had their password as password one, two, three, or, you know, the, the, the answer to one of those

1274
01:55:48,240 --> 01:55:52,720
Facebook memes going around or something like, I'm sure, I'm sure your information was super safe.

1275
01:55:52,720 --> 01:56:00,560
It was, it was only available to other press. Um, black and Pat in chat says their initial

1276
01:56:00,560 --> 01:56:05,840
statement because I got the same email as Jeff was to beware and co-stream at your own risk

1277
01:56:05,840 --> 01:56:10,960
of terms of service violations on the platform you choose. And I would think that the ESA,

1278
01:56:10,960 --> 01:56:17,200
if they were an industry that is truly represents the gaming industry and gaming culture would be

1279
01:56:17,200 --> 01:56:22,720
pushing back on the music industry, or at least trying to come to some sort of agreement on this

1280
01:56:22,720 --> 01:56:26,000
so that we don't have to suffer, but the ESA doesn't give a fuck about us.

1281
01:56:26,880 --> 01:56:30,480
Hmm. And that's the reality. They care about their bottom line.

1282
01:56:31,920 --> 01:56:38,720
They care about the money that they can make and removing any form of it's all about control.

1283
01:56:38,720 --> 01:56:44,320
It really is about controlling the whole thing. Uh, and black and Pat says, as a result,

1284
01:56:44,320 --> 01:56:50,080
I canned co-streaming the Xbox briefing today for safety. Now on one hand, uh, Microsoft did

1285
01:56:50,080 --> 01:56:53,920
kind of give express permission on their own. However, that being said, I don't blame you.

1286
01:56:53,920 --> 01:56:56,880
I absolutely don't blame you. You don't want to take the risk. Why take the risk?

1287
01:56:56,880 --> 01:57:00,720
Especially when you we've just acknowledged earlier in the show, you've worked very hard

1288
01:57:00,720 --> 01:57:05,520
on your channel to this point where you're about to become a Twitch partner. If anybody

1289
01:57:05,520 --> 01:57:08,800
that looks at your application has a brain, you're going to be a Twitch partner.

1290
01:57:08,800 --> 01:57:15,920
And, um, you know, and this, this whole thing. And, uh, I like they, they, they lost you

1291
01:57:17,040 --> 01:57:20,960
beak out of this whole fear thing. And I think that's a, that's a, that's a really unfortunate

1292
01:57:20,960 --> 01:57:25,280
thing. Cause I know, I know you gals are big Xbox fans, you big, huge supporters of Microsoft,

1293
01:57:25,280 --> 01:57:29,680
uh, from day one, they, they really miss something by not having you co-stream today.

1294
01:57:29,680 --> 01:57:34,800
And it's because of, and it's not Microsoft's fault. It's not your fault. It's all this other

1295
01:57:34,800 --> 01:57:38,560
fuckery. And at the end of the day, you want to, you don't want to lose what you've built.

1296
01:57:38,560 --> 01:57:45,680
And I get that. I totally get that. Um, let's see, uh, tiger claw and chat says,

1297
01:57:45,680 --> 01:57:49,440
streaming the guardians of the galaxy game is going to be difficult due to the game having

1298
01:57:49,440 --> 01:57:53,920
licensed music. Won't you be able to, didn't they say something about a streamer safe mode

1299
01:57:53,920 --> 01:57:57,920
or am I, I might be thinking of a different game, but that is an interesting thing we're in now is

1300
01:57:57,920 --> 01:58:02,640
that games have to have streamer safe modes and two soundtracks. Because again, we can't work

1301
01:58:02,640 --> 01:58:06,080
our shit out with the music industry. You would think that they would just,

1302
01:58:06,080 --> 01:58:10,720
they would save money, not even having the licensed music in there. I know it compromises

1303
01:58:10,720 --> 01:58:17,360
their vision, I guess, but yeah, you can save money. They like to save money, right?

1304
01:58:17,360 --> 01:58:27,520
Yeah. Yeah. All right. Um, Phoenix 7726 says, I'm not saying boycotting E3 is a wise idea,

1305
01:58:27,520 --> 01:58:31,600
but well, it's going to be interesting to see what happens when they come back.

1306
01:58:31,600 --> 01:58:39,120
And let's, let's also keep in mind this week was not just about E3. We also had summer game fest.

1307
01:58:39,120 --> 01:58:44,960
We also had several independent things that were rising up. And, you know, obviously I said summer

1308
01:58:44,960 --> 01:58:49,360
game fest had some of its own issues, but there was also a lot of positives about that event.

1309
01:58:49,360 --> 01:58:55,840
And so maybe E3 is starting to get a little bit of competition. And I think that's a very good

1310
01:58:55,840 --> 01:59:02,400
thing at this point, to be honest. Yeah. Anyway. All right. Um, let's move on. Speaking of

1311
01:59:02,400 --> 01:59:06,480
Microsoft stuff, I think this is very exciting and something I'm kind of surprised they didn't really

1312
01:59:06,480 --> 01:59:12,960
talk a lot about, um, at the event today was they didn't really get into xCloud and how that's all

1313
01:59:12,960 --> 01:59:16,320
going to work or any of that, but I guess maybe they're going to save that for a special event or

1314
01:59:16,320 --> 01:59:22,640
something like that, but there are Xbox video gaming, video games, streaming sticks that are

1315
01:59:22,640 --> 01:59:27,840
going to be on the way. So a few days before the whole live event, uh, apparently some executives

1316
01:59:27,840 --> 01:59:33,520
sat down to talk about what's going on here. Uh, there was a little, uh, prerecorded media thing

1317
01:59:33,520 --> 01:59:39,760
between Phil Spencer and, uh, Stan Nadella, uh, who was talking about game pass and Azure and all

1318
01:59:39,760 --> 01:59:45,680
that, and then talked about how Xbox is working with TV manufacturers around the world to get

1319
01:59:45,680 --> 01:59:50,640
game pass on TVs, which makes a lot of sense. Um, I think PlayStation had a thing with some,

1320
01:59:50,640 --> 01:59:56,320
well, there is probably Sony TVs, but I think PlayStation was on some TVs like that whole, um,

1321
01:59:56,320 --> 02:00:00,320
is it placed? Yeah. PlayStation now I think it was on some TVs, but so it would make a lot of

1322
02:00:00,320 --> 02:00:05,200
sense that Xbox goes there too. Um, if you have game pass ultimate, you're going to have the cloud

1323
02:00:05,200 --> 02:00:09,840
ability. And so you'd be able to play Xbox titles with just a controller. So you have your Xbox

1324
02:00:09,840 --> 02:00:14,320
controller, you hook it up to the little streaming stick and bang. Now you have the cloud. I love

1325
02:00:14,320 --> 02:00:19,120
this idea because this means I'll be able to play video games in the bedroom, uh, from my series X

1326
02:00:19,120 --> 02:00:23,440
in the living room. I think this is great. I hope the sticks aren't too expensive, but I don't see

1327
02:00:23,440 --> 02:00:27,280
why they would be. So yeah, they're developing standalone streaming devices. You can plug into

1328
02:00:27,280 --> 02:00:31,920
your TV or monitor. So it sounds a lot like a Chromecast. Um, so I think this sounds awesome.

1329
02:00:32,000 --> 02:00:36,320
And I, I can't wait to check this out. So is this streaming from your Xbox

1330
02:00:36,320 --> 02:00:43,600
series X or is this just streaming through, uh, X cloud streaming from the web?

1331
02:00:43,600 --> 02:00:51,840
My understanding is both exist. Uh, and that, that I'm not sure which of the two it is here,

1332
02:00:51,840 --> 02:00:57,440
but I think you can choose which it is. I think one is called one thing and one is called the

1333
02:00:57,440 --> 02:01:03,040
other. I think when you're doing like Xbox cloud gaming and that, that is like in the cloud,

1334
02:01:03,040 --> 02:01:07,120
but when you're doing Xbox, I think there's something like play anywhere or something

1335
02:01:07,120 --> 02:01:13,760
like that. That's when you can play from your series X. Yeah. So we'll see, uh, dark soccer.

1336
02:01:13,760 --> 02:01:21,120
What do you have for us? Well, uh, hackers gonna hack and Steelers gonna steal. So, um,

1337
02:01:21,120 --> 02:01:28,000
they have stolen the source code to FIFA 2021 and EA's Frostbite engine.

1338
02:01:28,000 --> 02:01:34,000
You mean like FIFA 19? Yeah. Anyway, um,

1339
02:01:35,520 --> 02:01:42,880
on a few of the different, um, hacking forums, um, uh, it was found that they had taken

1340
02:01:42,880 --> 02:01:52,000
more than 780 gigabytes of data from EA. Um, and according to the screenshots that were shown,

1341
02:01:52,000 --> 02:01:59,120
it includes the source code for FIFA 2021 and, uh, source code and tools for the Frostbite game

1342
02:01:59,120 --> 02:02:06,320
engine. Um, and other assets look like different software development kits and they're trying to,

1343
02:02:06,320 --> 02:02:14,320
of course, sell these assets. Um, so they said that no data player data had been accessed,

1344
02:02:14,320 --> 02:02:20,400
so there's no risk to the player privacy, but, um, they've tried to plug up that whole really

1345
02:02:20,400 --> 02:02:25,200
quickly. Um, and of course, I mean, it's not the first time this has happened. Um,

1346
02:02:25,200 --> 02:02:32,720
CD project red got a ransomware attack earlier in the year. Um, and they eventually, uh, sold

1347
02:02:32,720 --> 02:02:40,880
the source code to that game too. Um, but now EA is saying that they're not going to be affected

1348
02:02:40,880 --> 02:02:47,280
the same way, but that remains to be seen. Well, I saw an article that it's like completely

1349
02:02:47,280 --> 02:02:52,080
speculative. I think it's more of like, I wish this would happen. Um, where they're saying that

1350
02:02:52,080 --> 02:02:56,480
they could dig through the source code for like, say FIFA or something like that, to see how

1351
02:02:56,480 --> 02:03:02,080
they use loot boxes and whatever to manipulate people into spending money on that stuff.

1352
02:03:02,800 --> 02:03:08,000
Expose them, basically, they're never going to do that. They're, they're in it for the ransom

1353
02:03:08,000 --> 02:03:14,800
and that's it. There's no white hat, white hat hackers in that group at all. I'm assuming.

1354
02:03:14,800 --> 02:03:20,160
Although if someone did want to say, pay for said source code, right.

1355
02:03:22,000 --> 02:03:26,400
And then use, use that knowledge for an altruistic purpose.

1356
02:03:26,800 --> 02:03:27,300
Maybe.

1357
02:03:28,960 --> 02:03:30,560
No, they're selling it for 28 million.

1358
02:03:31,360 --> 02:03:32,880
I don't have 28 million.

1359
02:03:32,880 --> 02:03:36,960
Well, especially with all the, um, you know, things that, especially with all the things

1360
02:03:36,960 --> 02:03:41,040
that EA kind of sells, like the FIFA cards and things like that, if somebody got the source code,

1361
02:03:41,040 --> 02:03:46,560
they could really exploit that. Um, I would think, and, uh, kind of build a black market

1362
02:03:46,560 --> 02:03:50,000
of fake stuff. You know what I mean? It could be very interesting.

1363
02:03:50,000 --> 02:03:52,560
Or maybe they could fix a mass effect Andromeda.

1364
02:03:53,200 --> 02:03:54,560
Isn't that the truth?

1365
02:03:55,680 --> 02:03:57,920
Anyhow, a few more stories for you guys.

1366
02:03:57,920 --> 02:03:58,420
Loki.

1367
02:03:59,600 --> 02:04:05,440
All right. So I've, I'm honestly not surprised at all. I'm surprised it took this long.

1368
02:04:05,440 --> 02:04:10,560
So we have a story about Roblox being sued by music publishers for $200 million

1369
02:04:10,560 --> 02:04:15,600
regarding, um, illegal use of songs from numerous artists.

1370
02:04:15,600 --> 02:04:23,200
I've seen so many games on Roblox that my kids play. They just have like all this licensed music,

1371
02:04:23,200 --> 02:04:27,280
just all over the place. Cause it's kid, kids making it a lot of times and they don't know.

1372
02:04:27,280 --> 02:04:32,720
They're just like, whatever, it's mine. I can put it in there. It's just, it's all over the place.

1373
02:04:32,720 --> 02:04:39,600
So apparently the national music publishers association is suing them, um, that they're

1374
02:04:39,600 --> 02:04:43,600
making hundreds of millions of dollars by requiring users to pay every time that they

1375
02:04:43,600 --> 02:04:48,400
upload music onto the platform or that they should be making, um, them pay that.

1376
02:04:48,400 --> 02:04:53,680
Um, so they said it points out some of the major artists affected Ariana Grande,

1377
02:04:53,680 --> 02:04:59,120
Imagine Dragons Deadmau5, it's, it's everything. It's everything. Seriously. It's, it's all over

1378
02:04:59,120 --> 02:05:05,760
the place. Like, and it's not even necessarily just music. It's IP as well. There's so much IP

1379
02:05:05,760 --> 02:05:14,080
theft on there. It's just, it's very unregulated. Well, it will be soon. Right?

1380
02:05:15,200 --> 02:05:19,440
That's a good way to do it. It's a wild west for right now, but that's going to be locked

1381
02:05:19,440 --> 02:05:26,240
down pretty fast. Teach the kids the lessons early. Unfortunately. Intellectual property

1382
02:05:26,240 --> 02:05:30,080
got to smack it down. This one, you know, it's funny, even though I was very critical of like

1383
02:05:30,080 --> 02:05:33,680
the music industry and needing to modernize a little bit ago, this one, I'm a little more

1384
02:05:33,680 --> 02:05:37,200
sympathetic to them on because there's the clear difference here is that a lot of these Roblox

1385
02:05:37,200 --> 02:05:42,640
add-ons are being sold, uh, for money and all that. So I kind of think, yeah, the music industry

1386
02:05:42,640 --> 02:05:46,880
kind of has a right to step, but I, again, I, maybe they're very frustrated and they're suing

1387
02:05:46,880 --> 02:05:51,440
all of Roblox because they can't bought it. They can't find this stuff through bots. So they're

1388
02:05:51,440 --> 02:05:55,760
just like, we're going to sue Roblox into oblivion. Well, this is exactly what happened

1389
02:05:55,760 --> 02:06:02,720
to YouTube. And so it's basically, if they don't have a process where it's regulated like this,

1390
02:06:02,720 --> 02:06:06,800
it's gonna, they're going to lock it down. It could be like Twitch where we end up seeing,

1391
02:06:06,800 --> 02:06:11,360
I don't think they're going to like ban you. I mean, they could ban users, I guess, but like,

1392
02:06:11,360 --> 02:06:14,800
I don't think it's going to, it's more of just like removing the offending content.

1393
02:06:14,800 --> 02:06:18,240
And a lot of the games out there that have like a lot of the slices of music thrown in,

1394
02:06:18,240 --> 02:06:23,040
it's just, they're like trash, but I don't think it's any like more of the popular games that are

1395
02:06:23,040 --> 02:06:27,680
doing this. It's more of just like all the trash that people make because anybody can make stuff

1396
02:06:27,680 --> 02:06:33,680
and post games on Roblox. It's just kids that do that just think, oh, well,

1397
02:06:33,680 --> 02:06:37,040
I'm going to go to YouTube and I'm going to steal the sound effect, or I'm going to go to YouTube

1398
02:06:37,040 --> 02:06:41,200
and I'm going to steal this music and throw it in there. And they don't, they don't know. They

1399
02:06:41,200 --> 02:06:50,080
don't know anything about, you know, their IP and stuff like that. So yeah, like I said, I said this

1400
02:06:50,640 --> 02:06:54,400
months ago that this is bound to happen. So yeah, here we are.

1401
02:06:55,040 --> 02:07:00,480
Here we are. All right. Last tonight, before we get to emails and all that other good stuff,

1402
02:07:00,480 --> 02:07:04,240
we have a very interesting promotion coming from Jackbox Games because of course they have

1403
02:07:04,240 --> 02:07:11,280
Jackbox Party Pack 7 to promote. So apparently in the next week, Jackbox is going to be letting you

1404
02:07:11,280 --> 02:07:18,080
hire free practice friends. What are practice? Yeah, you get practice friends and what they're

1405
02:07:18,080 --> 02:07:21,840
going to do, they're going to remind you what it's like to be around other people.

1406
02:07:21,840 --> 02:07:28,480
You sign up and you get to compete for time slots, and then you get 30 minutes of judgment free

1407
02:07:29,200 --> 02:07:35,920
Jackbox Party Pack game time. And so the Jackbox Party Pack folks, they all must be hired improv

1408
02:07:35,920 --> 02:07:40,320
actors or something. They're going to help you remember how to interact with people because,

1409
02:07:40,320 --> 02:07:44,880
you know, it's been a long 15 months. But I don't plan on interacting with people ever again.

1410
02:07:44,880 --> 02:07:49,440
Well, then maybe this isn't the promotion for you, perhaps.

1411
02:07:49,440 --> 02:07:55,520
I'm living my hikikomori fantasy, yo. In fact, the interesting thing about it

1412
02:07:56,240 --> 02:08:00,640
and the thing that I think they may have missed is that the last thing I want to do right now is

1413
02:08:00,640 --> 02:08:06,640
a virtual hangout like that virtual hangouts. I've been doing that for 15 months. I don't

1414
02:08:06,640 --> 02:08:13,920
want to do it anymore. So I think that may be where they made an error. But you know what?

1415
02:08:14,640 --> 02:08:19,040
We need a brunch so that we can learn how to hang out with people.

1416
02:08:20,240 --> 02:08:22,880
I've done brunch a couple times. And then there's food.

1417
02:08:22,880 --> 02:08:25,360
Yes. I have not been to a brunch.

1418
02:08:26,080 --> 02:08:27,840
What happened to miss? I don't want to see anybody.

1419
02:08:28,800 --> 02:08:35,920
Well, that's different. I'm talking about like people, quote fingers, people.

1420
02:08:35,920 --> 02:08:40,720
Oh, when you say you don't want to see people, but you do want to see a mimosa.

1421
02:08:41,520 --> 02:08:45,840
I want to see a mimosa and I want to hang out with my friends.

1422
02:08:45,840 --> 02:08:49,040
All right. My friends are better than people.

1423
02:08:50,320 --> 02:08:55,840
Bobby in chat is saying bring O.L.R. back in person. Well, we'll see what happens.

1424
02:08:57,200 --> 02:09:00,800
But I have a really good mic and you can wear my pajamas.

1425
02:09:00,800 --> 02:09:06,240
You can bring the mic here. You can wear your pajamas here. But or we can come there.

1426
02:09:06,240 --> 02:09:11,760
Oh, we could. But, you know, if I go out there, we could do sushi before the show.

1427
02:09:12,800 --> 02:09:16,720
Yes. We haven't done sushi before the show in a hot minute.

1428
02:09:16,720 --> 02:09:18,880
That is true. Now you're now you're starting to think of some of the pros.

1429
02:09:20,400 --> 02:09:25,040
Yeah, but then that means I would have to like. Rush right home to.

1430
02:09:26,560 --> 02:09:29,680
Yeah, well, just we'll talk about we'll talk about. All right. We'll figure it out.

1431
02:09:30,240 --> 02:09:35,600
All right. Let's let's figure some things out with the live interactions that are via chat.

1432
02:09:35,600 --> 02:09:39,440
If you have anything else you want to add there or you want to get to our mailbag,

1433
02:09:39,440 --> 02:09:43,120
participate at Orange Laundry dot com is the place to send us emails.

1434
02:09:43,120 --> 02:09:46,000
I'm also going to get to a few of the stories from discord.

1435
02:09:46,880 --> 02:09:51,600
So let's get to the mailbag. Participate at Orange Laundry dot com. I think I saw a

1436
02:09:51,600 --> 02:09:54,800
couple of emails tonight, right? Yeah, there's a few.

1437
02:09:56,880 --> 02:10:03,280
So I'll go ahead and start with the earliest one. Hi, Rob. Enthusiastically rave wave at Rob

1438
02:10:04,240 --> 02:10:11,040
regarding No Man's Sky. No Man's Sky is a game I bought at lunch and quickly became bored with.

1439
02:10:11,040 --> 02:10:14,560
This isn't because I was dissatisfied with the trailers or the hype of the game,

1440
02:10:14,560 --> 02:10:18,320
because I do not buy into the trailers or hype of anything.

1441
02:10:18,320 --> 02:10:24,160
Like Flavor Flav said, don't believe the hype. Rather, I became bored with No Man's Sky because

1442
02:10:24,160 --> 02:10:29,760
I didn't see the point. There wasn't a narrative to follow in the exploration game, nor was there

1443
02:10:29,760 --> 02:10:34,960
an objective for me to follow that I really cared to follow. I just didn't see the point.

1444
02:10:34,960 --> 02:10:38,640
So I stopped playing No Man's Sky because I didn't see the you said you didn't see the point.

1445
02:10:38,640 --> 02:10:45,440
That's repetitive, dude. I'm reconsidering playing No Man's Sky because I still own it on PS4.

1446
02:10:45,440 --> 02:10:49,600
So, Rob, as someone who has played No Man's Sky more than I have and clearly sees

1447
02:10:49,600 --> 02:10:53,120
more of a value to the game than I had in my initial playthrough.

1448
02:10:53,120 --> 02:10:57,920
Is there a point? Please be as open and broad as you wish. I'm open to being persuaded.

1449
02:10:57,920 --> 02:11:02,000
Stay care of entertainment. Well, the number one thing I could

1450
02:11:02,000 --> 02:11:07,440
say is that you already bought the game. Why do I need to convince you?

1451
02:11:07,440 --> 02:11:10,800
Like you're not going to be spending any money to get in there and play it again.

1452
02:11:10,800 --> 02:11:14,880
So I think you already spent there. They already got your money. You might as well get your money's

1453
02:11:14,880 --> 02:11:18,640
worth and go check out what they've changed. Like, you know, if this is a conversation on

1454
02:11:18,640 --> 02:11:21,760
me trying to convince you to buy the game, then I guess that might be kind of a different thing.

1455
02:11:21,760 --> 02:11:26,400
But if you already have it, like I think you're kind of just making up excuses not to play it,

1456
02:11:26,400 --> 02:11:30,400
which is fine. I do that all the time. I'm not saying like, oh, how dare you? Please.

1457
02:11:30,400 --> 02:11:34,400
I just talked about earlier in the show about, oh, I was playing this thing for like five minutes

1458
02:11:34,400 --> 02:11:38,240
and then, oh, got distracted by some outer worlds. I was playing outer worlds for a little bit and

1459
02:11:38,240 --> 02:11:42,160
then ended up flipping and going somewhere else. One of these days, I'll get back to outer worlds.

1460
02:11:42,160 --> 02:11:48,080
One of these days. But, you know, is there? Yes, they added a better story from what was there in

1461
02:11:48,080 --> 02:11:51,920
the beginning, but I'm not going to sit here and say, oh, it's got the depth of something like

1462
02:11:51,920 --> 02:11:58,800
Mass Effect. No, but there it is a better tutorial. It is a better like quest that walk

1463
02:11:58,800 --> 02:12:04,400
you piece by piece through the game that you don't feel like you're literally lost in space.

1464
02:12:04,400 --> 02:12:13,360
Like there is a thread that will help you move things along and, excuse me, excuse me, cough,

1465
02:12:13,360 --> 02:12:19,360
and will get you to a point where now you feel empowered enough to be able to explore on your

1466
02:12:19,360 --> 02:12:22,800
own. And I think that might, and from what your email is saying, that sounds like it was the

1467
02:12:22,800 --> 02:12:26,640
biggest piece that's missing for you is that the original version of No Man's Sky really didn't

1468
02:12:26,640 --> 02:12:32,240
give you shit. And now, now it's got, you know, a full compendium built into the game and most

1469
02:12:32,240 --> 02:12:36,880
importantly, quests that walk you through every piece of the way. You already own the game,

1470
02:12:36,880 --> 02:12:41,120
my friend. Get your money out of it. Do the thing. Do the thing.

1471
02:12:41,120 --> 02:12:51,600
All right, next up. What game genre name is most in need of an update or change? This comes from

1472
02:12:51,600 --> 02:12:59,200
D. I don't think any of them do. They're all fairly accurate.

1473
02:13:01,200 --> 02:13:08,480
No, I know. Walking sim. Walking sim needs to change. Because I think that term originally

1474
02:13:08,480 --> 02:13:12,560
was used kind of like in a negative context, like, oh, all you do in these games is you go

1475
02:13:12,560 --> 02:13:16,640
around and you walk, you know, when describing things like everybody's gone to the rapture,

1476
02:13:16,640 --> 02:13:23,840
dear Esther, whatever, what remains of that's more of a community colloquialism. It's not an

1477
02:13:23,840 --> 02:13:28,240
actual genre. Yeah, but I'm worried it's one of those things where it's like Xerox,

1478
02:13:28,240 --> 02:13:32,960
you say it so much, it sticks. You know what I mean? Like, if that happens, it happens. It's

1479
02:13:32,960 --> 02:13:41,440
just the nature of language. Yeah, I guess, I guess. But I mean, that's the one that comes

1480
02:13:41,440 --> 02:13:47,680
to mind. I think the walking sim that I'm seeing kind of out there, I try to kind of,

1481
02:13:47,680 --> 02:13:52,240
I love walking sim games, but I think it would be better if they were called something else. Like,

1482
02:13:52,240 --> 02:13:58,240
I don't know if we talk like narrative heavy or... That's what they're called. Like, everyone's gone

1483
02:13:58,240 --> 02:14:03,680
to the raptures, I think is what called just narrative game. Yeah, I think that's a better

1484
02:14:03,680 --> 02:14:09,760
label for it. But that's what it's actually called. The walking sim is more a community

1485
02:14:09,760 --> 02:14:16,560
colloquialism for it. All right. It's not actually the genre name. Loki? What about like,

1486
02:14:17,520 --> 02:14:21,200
like Mr. Something like that? Because that almost reminds me of like a walking sim, I guess,

1487
02:14:21,200 --> 02:14:28,480
unless there's not really puzzles to solve in say, you know, a quote unquote walking sim game.

1488
02:14:29,200 --> 02:14:33,360
I don't know. Even something like Gone Home had puzzles in it. I mean, it was a little light.

1489
02:14:33,360 --> 02:14:41,840
It was more like adventure puzzler. Yeah. You know, but or I like what Siata Berry says

1490
02:14:41,840 --> 02:14:45,600
enhanced visual novel. I mean, that's what some of these are, but they're more considered. I think

1491
02:14:45,600 --> 02:14:50,400
the genre is actually called like narrative adventure. Yeah, enhanced visual novel makes

1492
02:14:50,400 --> 02:14:57,040
me think of something like Hot Devil Boyfriend or something like that. That's dating sim. Well,

1493
02:14:57,040 --> 02:15:01,520
that's Yeah, like, like, that's kind of what I Yeah, so I like an actual visual novel

1494
02:15:02,480 --> 02:15:08,480
would be something like, well, I mean, I had like a bunch of visual novel games like co new that

1495
02:15:08,480 --> 02:15:13,680
were based off of anime like back in the day, where you just basically follow the story and

1496
02:15:13,680 --> 02:15:21,680
little bits of it are animated. But, yeah. Anyway, I mean, that was that was the thing

1497
02:15:21,680 --> 02:15:27,920
that popped in my head with the question. So because I mean, I adventure music game,

1498
02:15:27,920 --> 02:15:34,480
retro fantasy, RPG, I don't have a problem with any of those. I kind of want to D, I want you to

1499
02:15:34,480 --> 02:15:39,040
email us back. How would you answer this question? Because I'm kind of curious. I don't know. I'm

1500
02:15:39,040 --> 02:15:43,680
just like, I'm kind of curious. Like, because sometimes I feel like maybe you got this question

1501
02:15:43,680 --> 02:15:48,240
from something you want to see different. And so I'm like, curious what that is. So

1502
02:15:49,040 --> 02:15:55,280
Oh, hell, Rob. Look at what just happened in chat. Oh, we just hit our point reward goal

1503
02:15:56,000 --> 02:16:02,000
for Episode One of OLR with commentary. So we have to figure out a day that's gonna work for that.

1504
02:16:02,000 --> 02:16:07,600
Yeah, we just raised 150,000 points. That's the most we've ever had for a reward. Yeah,

1505
02:16:07,680 --> 02:16:12,480
Shane was the lucky one to cross the line there. Are you I don't know if you guys are you guys

1506
02:16:12,480 --> 02:16:20,640
generally available on Wednesdays? I work until 830. Drat. What night? But

1507
02:16:23,200 --> 02:16:27,360
I can make arrangements. Well, because I was going to say June 23rd, which is the actual

1508
02:16:27,360 --> 02:16:30,400
birthday of the show, is a Wednesday this year. And I was thinking that would be a good day for

1509
02:16:30,400 --> 02:16:35,920
it. But if you were to happen, you make it happen. I will talk offline. I don't don't hold this to

1510
02:16:35,920 --> 02:16:40,480
that day yet. Chat, because clearly arrangements have to be made. But that is we're going to aim

1511
02:16:40,480 --> 02:16:45,600
around that day if nothing else. Sound good. All right. But it may not be in person because

1512
02:16:45,600 --> 02:16:49,680
I'd probably have to just get right off work and hop on. Oh, no, I don't think this has to

1513
02:16:49,680 --> 02:16:55,440
be in person. I think we can do it over over Discord or whatever. Yeah. All right. Last email.

1514
02:16:55,440 --> 02:17:01,760
Yes. Hello, LR. I was super excited when I heard about Tyto's upcoming mini arcade cabinet based

1515
02:17:01,760 --> 02:17:07,680
on the full size egret 2 candy cap. I was also super excited to hear about it mentioned on OLR.

1516
02:17:07,680 --> 02:17:12,560
But some of the amazing and coolest things about this mini were not mentioned. So I had no choice

1517
02:17:12,560 --> 02:17:18,400
but to enlighten you all as to why this will be the best mini gaming thingy ever. Does it have a

1518
02:17:18,400 --> 02:17:25,040
link cable? Why? Why are I'm going to finish reading? Thank you. Of course, we know that

1519
02:17:25,040 --> 02:17:31,440
Tyto has a history of filled with amazing classic games, and we've been promised 40 of them in this

1520
02:17:31,440 --> 02:17:35,840
thing. Most of the titles have yet to be announced, but already were given kicks, which

1521
02:17:35,840 --> 02:17:42,160
I love. Bubble Bobble, Elevator Action, Rustan, and the iconic Space Invaders. Based on that,

1522
02:17:42,160 --> 02:17:46,240
I feel like it's already safe to say this will have the best game selection of any mini cab to

1523
02:17:46,240 --> 02:17:51,600
date. If you grabbed or simply paid attention to Sega's Astro City mini arcade late last year,

1524
02:17:51,600 --> 02:17:56,240
or one of the biggest one of the biggest complaints about it was its widescreen monitor.

1525
02:17:56,320 --> 02:18:02,320
None of the classic games use widescreen after all. The new Tyto cab will not cheap out in this

1526
02:18:02,320 --> 02:18:08,880
regard. It's coming with an honest to goodness four to three monitor. But the coolest thing

1527
02:18:08,880 --> 02:18:14,080
about the screen is that it rotates 90 degrees just like on the full size cabinet. This will

1528
02:18:14,080 --> 02:18:19,680
allow you to play all of the included vertically oriented games the way they were meant to be

1529
02:18:19,680 --> 02:18:24,720
played without scaling down the graphics to the size of postage stamp. Like the Astro City mini,

1530
02:18:24,720 --> 02:18:31,360
Tyto's new cab will be released alongside a full sized arcade stick. The stick is meant to have

1531
02:18:31,360 --> 02:18:39,040
to be an exact replica of the original Egret 2 candy cabs control panel. However, there's more.

1532
02:18:39,040 --> 02:18:45,760
In addition to that arcade stick, Tyto is also releasing a full sized replica panel containing

1533
02:18:45,760 --> 02:18:50,640
both a paddle controller and trackball. Not only does this mean we'll be getting some of Tyto's

1534
02:18:50,640 --> 02:18:56,000
greatest games that uses control methods, but also standard USB plug will allow us to use it

1535
02:18:56,000 --> 02:19:01,040
with emulators on PC as well. Paddle and trackball controllers are not readily available in plug and

1536
02:19:01,040 --> 02:19:06,560
play solutions, so I'm super excited to get this. This is a long email. The paddle and trackball

1537
02:19:06,560 --> 02:19:12,080
panel include an SD card with 10 additional games, bringing the total up to 50, including

1538
02:19:12,080 --> 02:19:18,000
such classics as Arkanoid, Strike Bowling, and Camel Tree, which is one of my personal favorites.

1539
02:19:18,880 --> 02:19:23,440
Strike, uh, sorry, and just in case you missed that, yes, you can add additional games with

1540
02:19:23,440 --> 02:19:27,440
SD cards. None of the other mini cabs have this capability. Hopefully there will be

1541
02:19:28,240 --> 02:19:32,880
many more card releases. You can switch the joystick between 8-way and 4-way operation.

1542
02:19:32,880 --> 02:19:37,120
Instruction cards are included that sit right on top of the cab. Never mind the fact that Tyto

1543
02:19:37,120 --> 02:19:42,240
games have some of the best soundtracks before video game soundtracks were even cool. There are

1544
02:19:42,240 --> 02:19:47,440
a million reasons to get this. You should probably go to Amazon Japan and pre-order the Everything

1545
02:19:47,520 --> 02:19:51,200
bundle right now that includes the mini cab, the paddle, the trackball controller with its bonus

1546
02:19:51,200 --> 02:19:56,800
games, a full-size cab, uh, the paddle and trackball controller. Wait, I'm, I'm, I'm a

1547
02:19:56,800 --> 02:20:01,200
line back. The full-size joystick, an additional controller, which is far more compact. The

1548
02:20:01,200 --> 02:20:05,920
instruction cards, an art book, a collection of soundtrack CDs, and more for the low, low price

1549
02:20:05,920 --> 02:20:11,680
of $410 US dollars for shipping. Do it, do it now. Of course, there are smaller packages available

1550
02:20:11,680 --> 02:20:15,360
if you don't actually want all those things, but why wouldn't you want all of those things?

1551
02:20:15,600 --> 02:20:20,480
Sorry, that was long, a little late for that, but I hope my excitement came across. I can't

1552
02:20:20,480 --> 02:20:25,040
wait to play this thing. Yeah, Forza Horizon 5 looks pretty cool too. Have a great week.

1553
02:20:25,040 --> 02:20:30,400
Already pre-ordered, Aaron Yyr. Hey, I appreciate the long email with all the details on that

1554
02:20:30,400 --> 02:20:34,400
because, um, yeah, you know, I, I knew about like the screen rotating and things like that,

1555
02:20:34,400 --> 02:20:39,200
but you know, you really went into some detail there on that. I, 400 might be a bit much,

1556
02:20:39,200 --> 02:20:42,640
but then of course you're talking, of course I say that and then in the same breath as like,

1557
02:20:42,640 --> 02:20:48,320
but I'll pay it for Tron. So clearly, clearly we all have our faves and we all have those

1558
02:20:48,320 --> 02:20:52,800
weak spots and the things that God damn it moment with the wallet and all that stuff.

1559
02:20:52,800 --> 02:20:58,000
So, um, this is one of yours and Tron is one of mine, but I think you make a good pitch for it.

1560
02:20:58,000 --> 02:21:01,840
If I, if I had that type of extra money on the side, I'd love to pick one up, but I just,

1561
02:21:01,840 --> 02:21:05,440
I don't in space, but I just don't see that happening right now, but maybe in the future,

1562
02:21:06,080 --> 02:21:11,600
we'll see. All right. Was that it for emails? That was it. That was it for emails. Um, I was

1563
02:21:11,600 --> 02:21:14,720
trying to scan. That was a lot of email to read though. It was a lot of emails tonight,

1564
02:21:14,720 --> 02:21:20,160
but we hope you'll bring more participate at orange lounge, radio.com. Um, some things from

1565
02:21:20,160 --> 02:21:25,600
the Twitter verse that, um, Simpsons arcade one-up was finally officially confirmed, uh,

1566
02:21:25,600 --> 02:21:31,040
this week. And, uh, yes, that's happening, but no word on the Tron thing yet. Although I guess we

1567
02:21:31,040 --> 02:21:34,400
imagine that will happen, uh, a really cool thing that was posted in our discord. Um,

1568
02:21:34,400 --> 02:21:38,560
and if you haven't seen this YouTube, uh, definitely Google on YouTube or, you know,

1569
02:21:38,560 --> 02:21:44,720
look it up this 40 new musicians. Welcome back soak into final fantasy 14 or Bobby posted the

1570
02:21:44,720 --> 02:21:48,960
link in our discord. And I encourage you to join our discord vog network.com. That's VOG

1571
02:21:48,960 --> 02:21:54,000
network.com slash discord. And you can help, uh, get stories to catch our attention throughout the

1572
02:21:54,000 --> 02:21:58,240
week and share cool little links like that. Obviously we had that, um, story a couple of

1573
02:21:58,240 --> 02:22:03,280
weeks ago with, um, soak in revealing his battle with cancer, um, at the final fantasy 14 virtual

1574
02:22:03,280 --> 02:22:09,120
fan fest this year. Um, so that whole, uh, the 40 musicians collaborating to kind of welcome him

1575
02:22:09,120 --> 02:22:14,720
back and, and really kind of do a thank you. Um, I think it's really cool. I think this is really

1576
02:22:14,720 --> 02:22:23,280
cool. SSJ 100, Matt shared, uh, a hidden 1984 level in Tetris effect. That is a throwback to

1577
02:22:23,280 --> 02:22:28,400
the original computer terminal, the electronic a 60, and that's what the Tetris game was made

1578
02:22:28,400 --> 02:22:33,680
for originally. And it's got a really cool look to it. Um, I know there's an old, like,

1579
02:22:34,320 --> 02:22:38,560
maybe like 91 or something like that level in Tetris effect. That's really cool looking.

1580
02:22:38,560 --> 02:22:42,560
This one looks cool too. Like it really looks like an old ass computer terminal,

1581
02:22:42,560 --> 02:22:47,760
but Tetris effect in it. And I think that's just another reason to fire up an old game like that

1582
02:22:47,760 --> 02:22:55,520
again. That's for sure. Um, and then one other story that I think is just, yeah, just barely

1583
02:22:55,520 --> 02:23:02,240
from this week, um, Facebook gaming is trying to lure some folk. Tiger claw shared this one. Oh

1584
02:23:02,240 --> 02:23:08,000
no, I shared this one, but what it was a discussion that tiger call, Oh, because tiger

1585
02:23:08,000 --> 02:23:13,440
claw had posted the thing about, uh, that you will no longer be able to use Facebook to log into

1586
02:23:13,440 --> 02:23:18,320
Twitch. And that started a much longer conversation. And then I had found that story on Kotaku earlier

1587
02:23:18,320 --> 02:23:22,560
this week about how, uh, Facebook gaming is apparently going to be giving a hundred percent

1588
02:23:22,560 --> 02:23:28,720
of proceeds to their partners, uh, for a couple of years to try to make, uh, the Facebook gaming

1589
02:23:28,720 --> 02:23:34,160
revenue share platform a little more, uh, lucrative. And, um, as much as I don't like

1590
02:23:34,160 --> 02:23:38,960
Facebook and I, I, I will not go to Facebook gaming, uh, unless a lot changes. I mean,

1591
02:23:38,960 --> 02:23:42,960
I guess I shouldn't ever permanently close the door or burn the bridge down completely,

1592
02:23:42,960 --> 02:23:48,080
but a lot would have to change. I'm pretty happy here on Twitch, but I think it would be great if

1593
02:23:48,080 --> 02:23:54,080
the competition and all that maybe did light a fire to Twitch to maybe increase the revenue

1594
02:23:54,080 --> 02:23:58,000
sharing. We get a little bit here because right now it's 50 50. It would be nice if it was a

1595
02:23:58,000 --> 02:24:03,120
little bit higher, but I suppose, you know, Twitch as it is, uh, Amazon has questions about the

1596
02:24:03,120 --> 02:24:09,760
profitability and all that stuff. So, um, maybe we got to be careful, but I, I dunno, I just feel

1597
02:24:09,760 --> 02:24:15,520
like there's gotta be other way. Maybe if Twitch got into some of these things like, um, creating

1598
02:24:15,520 --> 02:24:22,480
merchandise, like, you know, right now we use a stream lab store and other companies use other

1599
02:24:22,480 --> 02:24:27,200
types of third-party stores to sell merchandise. And it seems a little silly when Twitch is backed

1600
02:24:27,200 --> 02:24:32,080
by Amazon that they didn't get on the merch store thing first. I just think there's other ways and

1601
02:24:32,080 --> 02:24:37,280
other ideas and things they could come up with, um, for revenue sharing that, um, then they could

1602
02:24:37,280 --> 02:24:41,680
give more of a cut of bits and subs, but certainly that Facebook thing is going to give a little added

1603
02:24:41,680 --> 02:24:46,720
pressure. Although it should, you know, if you really look at all the, if, then, buts, the

1604
02:24:46,720 --> 02:24:51,600
footnotes and everything that really goes with that Facebook deal, it's not going to be like

1605
02:24:51,600 --> 02:24:57,200
everybody. It's going to be some people to try to, you know, lure them from the Twitch and all that

1606
02:24:57,200 --> 02:25:02,560
stuff. So, um, something to keep in mind, the headline was a little deceiving in that regard

1607
02:25:02,560 --> 02:25:06,800
is it doesn't get into all the footnotes, but again, we all know headlines are set up to be

1608
02:25:06,800 --> 02:25:14,400
clickbait on where? Facebook. So, all right. Anyway, that's, uh, it for the discord comments

1609
02:25:14,400 --> 02:25:18,480
tonight. And so I think that is about going to wrap it up for our show tonight, unless

1610
02:25:18,480 --> 02:25:22,320
let me check in with Loki and or Dark Sakura for any last minute stories.

1611
02:25:25,760 --> 02:25:31,040
Um, I mean, one of the other announcements that they had, you know, Netflix wise, we, did we talk

1612
02:25:31,040 --> 02:25:37,200
about Lance Reddick being, uh, a Wesker? No, we didn't, but, um, yes, that's a great thing to

1613
02:25:37,200 --> 02:25:41,840
mention the whole, uh, Resident Evil cast being revealed. Yeah. So that's gonna be pretty awesome.

1614
02:25:43,200 --> 02:25:48,720
Awesome. Um, Dark Tetsuya is bringing up, uh, from the arcade one upside of things,

1615
02:25:48,720 --> 02:25:53,680
the class of 81 cabinet that was not leaked, but they announced that it's going to be like a Ms.

1616
02:25:53,680 --> 02:25:59,040
Pac-Man, uh, and Galaga kind of combined thing. And that's got, but there's, there's much more

1617
02:25:59,120 --> 02:26:04,720
to that as well. So it's pretty cool. Oh, thank you, Matt, for reminding me.

1618
02:26:04,720 --> 02:26:11,040
Intellivision amico is having a press thing tomorrow, uh, 9 45 in the morning, our time

1619
02:26:11,040 --> 02:26:16,560
Pacific, uh, 12 45 Eastern. So that could be interesting because they are launching this

1620
02:26:16,560 --> 02:26:20,800
holiday. Um, so we'll get a little more, you know, they've been kind of putting out more and more

1621
02:26:20,800 --> 02:26:25,440
details about the games, but I really think we're going to get a sense of what is, what is, what is

1622
02:26:25,440 --> 02:26:29,920
this all going to look like this holiday? What are all the games and all that stuff? So, um, we

1623
02:26:29,920 --> 02:26:35,280
know a lot, uh, and we know, I think all the free ones at this point, but, uh, we, we can't forget

1624
02:26:35,280 --> 02:26:39,120
that Intellivision amico is a thing and that's happening this holiday. So they're going to have

1625
02:26:39,120 --> 02:26:46,880
their press thing tomorrow. All right. Anything else? All right. I'm playing with the light on my

1626
02:26:46,880 --> 02:26:52,560
mic on the camera. It's weird. Uh, I think we will wrap things up. Thank you guys so much for, uh,

1627
02:26:52,560 --> 02:26:55,920
checking out our show tonight, downloading our show and checking out orange launch radio.

1628
02:26:55,920 --> 02:27:00,640
Appreciate you guys. If would you, if, excuse me, if you like what you heard here at orange

1629
02:27:00,640 --> 02:27:04,560
launch radio, tell a friend or two about the show, help us spread the word because we are the show

1630
02:27:04,560 --> 02:27:09,120
where every gamer has a voice, but if the voices aren't here to put out on air, then what are we

1631
02:27:09,120 --> 02:27:14,240
going to do? So a nice five star review on a site like iTunes, uh, goes an awful long way as well.

1632
02:27:14,240 --> 02:27:18,320
And we always appreciate that type of support. Um, thank you. Thank you so much. Uh, again,

1633
02:27:18,320 --> 02:27:22,160
we had a hype train going on earlier tonight. I will acknowledge everybody after the credits here.

1634
02:27:22,320 --> 02:27:25,520
Um, but I just want to say thank you. You guys don't have to do that, but you do.

1635
02:27:25,520 --> 02:27:29,760
Um, and, and just thanks so much. Even if you're just listening to the show

1636
02:27:29,760 --> 02:27:33,200
and you like never email us or tweet us or anything, you're a lurker,

1637
02:27:33,200 --> 02:27:37,440
you know what? I appreciate that. You know what? I lurk in a lot of Twitch feeds, so

1638
02:27:37,440 --> 02:27:43,360
it's fine. Um, I do too fairly regularly. Well, I lurk and then I see dark soccer

1639
02:27:43,360 --> 02:27:48,880
chatting in the side. So I have to go, hi, BB, even though sometimes I feel that's

1640
02:27:48,880 --> 02:27:52,000
disrespectful to the streamer. You know, I gotta be careful cause I need to say

1641
02:27:52,000 --> 02:27:57,760
hi to the streamer and then say hi to Jamie. You know what? I think that it just happens cause

1642
02:27:57,760 --> 02:28:02,080
the community has gotten so close that everyone's going to say hi to everyone. So for sure. That's

1643
02:28:02,080 --> 02:28:07,120
true. That's true. All right. Uh, let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts for the night

1644
02:28:07,120 --> 02:28:12,560
and wrap it up. Um, Jamie, I will start with you. All right. Well maybe next week we'll find someone

1645
02:28:12,560 --> 02:28:21,520
else to raid. Okay. Um, it seems to be a point of contention. Okay. Um, Loki, your final thought

1646
02:28:21,520 --> 02:28:28,560
tonight? Uh, my final thought is I'm looking forward to taking a little bit of a break,

1647
02:28:30,720 --> 02:28:36,080
at least no more two in the morning Minecrafts. Oh yeah. You, uh, I was like taking a break.

1648
02:28:36,080 --> 02:28:40,880
Don't you have a lot of video to edit? No, no. Well, I still have a lot of video to

1649
02:28:40,880 --> 02:28:46,720
shoot, so it's, it's not even edit, but it's, it's everything. Yeah. Um, and then my final

1650
02:28:46,720 --> 02:28:51,920
thought tonight. Um, I don't know. Um, I, uh, thank you. Alan's in the kitchen, so I will

1651
02:28:51,920 --> 02:28:56,000
dedicate my final thought to Alan. Even though he's listening to his, Oh, he gave me a thumbs

1652
02:28:56,000 --> 02:29:02,720
up. Thank you for getting me the arcade cabinet and indulging in my stupid, um, addictions to,

1653
02:29:02,720 --> 02:29:07,920
uh, these mini cabs and so forth and buy me snacky foods and soda and whatever else you

1654
02:29:07,920 --> 02:29:13,520
got at target. So, all right. Excellent. Uh, that's it. A shout out to my husband at the

1655
02:29:13,520 --> 02:29:17,840
end of the show. Oh, all right. That's it. We're going to roll credits. We will see you guys next

1656
02:29:17,840 --> 02:29:25,520
week. Nintendo Tuesday in television Monday. I'm sure one of those we'll be talking about next

1657
02:29:25,520 --> 02:29:29,600
week. No, we'll talk about both and other stuff. I'm sure that comes up throughout the week. It's

1658
02:29:29,600 --> 02:29:33,120
still, it's going to be another big show next week. Stay tuned. We'll see you in seven days.
