WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:13.720
Tonight, we're going to talk about classic games getting cartoons, two of them. We've

00:13.720 --> 00:17.240
had video game universe TV shows, comics, movies, and more, but cartoons are having

00:17.240 --> 00:21.160
something of a renaissance, something of a long overdue proliferation in this, the streaming

00:21.160 --> 00:24.800
era, which is pretty on brand for gamers, now that I'm thinking about it. TV shows

00:24.800 --> 00:28.200
from video games, video games related to TV shows, you got your chocolate and my peanut

00:28.200 --> 00:32.280
butter, and so on. It's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Sommers, and Loki to provide

00:32.280 --> 00:35.640
actual detail about these two cartoons and the rest of the week's gaming news. Starting

00:35.640 --> 00:37.440
right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.

00:37.440 --> 00:47.400
Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show

00:47.400 --> 00:53.960
where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio. We are live once again here

00:53.960 --> 01:01.400
on June 27th, 2021 with episode number 874 of our show. My name is Rob Roberts and I

01:01.400 --> 01:07.360
am joined this week as I usually am by first off the one and only Dark Soccer, Jamie Sommers.

01:07.360 --> 01:08.960
I'm wearing merch.

01:08.960 --> 01:13.140
You are? I just noticed that while we were sitting on the cat thing before we go live

01:13.140 --> 01:17.840
here at Twitch, I was like, oh, she's got her new merch on. How do you like the shirt?

01:17.840 --> 01:21.800
The tank top is very thin, but it's comfortable and pretty stretchy.

01:21.800 --> 01:22.800
I was going to say.

01:22.800 --> 01:26.440
Raise her back. You can see the shoulder action.

01:26.440 --> 01:30.960
For these 100 degree days, it probably works out pretty well that it's kind of thin.

01:30.960 --> 01:37.600
I don't know. We're kind of low. I've got buddies who were up there in the Northeast

01:37.600 --> 01:40.720
who are like, it's way too hot to exist.

01:40.720 --> 01:45.600
Yeah, it's way hot. Well, it's way, one, it is hotter in the Pacific Northwest this weekend,

01:45.600 --> 01:52.480
but two, the architecture, the homes aren't all built for it. Here where we live and in

01:52.480 --> 01:57.800
places like Phoenix where it's always hot, central air conditioning is standard. Absolutely.

01:57.800 --> 02:01.560
You have to have it. But in places in the Pacific Northwest, they don't really see this

02:01.560 --> 02:06.000
a lot. So it's not always standard. So it's a little scary. So hope everybody's doing

02:06.000 --> 02:13.520
OK up there. They're feeling the heat a lot more than we are here in our area.

02:13.520 --> 02:18.720
Also, I will thank Dark Soccer for the cheap plug for our shop, Vogue Network dot com slash

02:18.720 --> 02:22.800
shop if you want to get a tank top to wear in the heat or otherwise.

02:22.800 --> 02:28.640
I saw someone bought one of the album art prints. Yeah, we got a tweet showing off the

02:28.640 --> 02:33.360
album art print and it looked really nice. Like, you know, I want one. Yeah. Now I kind

02:33.360 --> 02:36.960
of want one, too. Like, I have to admit, I didn't really know what it would look like.

02:36.960 --> 02:40.280
But now that, you know, I'm I'm glad a viewer took the risk and bought it and then tweeted

02:40.280 --> 02:43.600
us a picture because I'm like, oh, that's a nice little keepsake. I want one of those

02:43.600 --> 02:48.440
to hang in the studio, honestly. Maybe maybe I should put up a larger one. Maybe. Maybe.

02:48.440 --> 02:54.440
Who knows? We'll see. All right. Anyway, I told Dan I wanted to get one. You should you

02:54.440 --> 03:01.240
should buy all the things in our shop. What money? Good example. I don't know. The money.

03:01.240 --> 03:08.080
I will. I will. When I get more than 12 streamers watching me at any given point in time, the

03:08.080 --> 03:14.520
money spent on Dead by Daylight Cosmetics, which by which, by the way, I I finally finally

03:14.520 --> 03:19.560
after all this time splurged on this week, I I had to have the Chris skin for Dead by

03:19.560 --> 03:24.960
Daylight. Had to have it. I I bought the Chris and Claire. I bought all of the the Survivor

03:24.960 --> 03:29.600
ones, even though I don't play Survivor. And I bought a Nia outfit today so I could try

03:29.600 --> 03:35.040
to do the the outfit break. And I got it to work once, but I forgot to save the cosmetic

03:35.040 --> 03:41.600
on Nia so I could keep Cheryl with black hair. And so that didn't work. So I have to try

03:41.600 --> 03:46.700
it again. All right. Well, say hello as well. Playing a different game there in the background.

03:46.700 --> 03:52.040
Say hello to Tech Master Loki. Hello. Hi. What is that that's playing behind you tonight?

03:52.040 --> 03:57.320
I can't place that. Is that Rad Racer two? No. What is it? I can't place it again. It's

03:57.320 --> 04:01.360
definitely a racing game of this side. Looks like an eight bit game. It's a racing game.

04:01.640 --> 04:06.680
I can't tell if you're on a motor. Oh, you're on a motorcycle. Oh, it's the dang it. It's

04:06.680 --> 04:10.920
the one where you smack people when you're on the motorcycle. No, it's not. That's not

04:10.920 --> 04:18.160
Road Rash. He's playing a skateboarder. No, it's not skateboarder. What a rollerblader.

04:18.160 --> 04:27.280
Yes. You know what game it is? I give up. It's Skitchen. Oh, I've never I don't think

04:27.280 --> 04:31.120
I know that ever once played it. Yeah. Dark to see you got it in our chat, though, because

04:31.120 --> 04:34.880
we do tape live every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern at the

04:34.880 --> 04:38.560
voice of Geeks Network, Twitch dot TV slash Vogue Network. And if you want to participate

04:38.560 --> 04:41.960
along with our show, you can join us in our chat room just like dark to see you did and

04:41.960 --> 04:48.080
shouted out the name of the game there. Speaking of things that happened at Twitch on Vogue

04:48.080 --> 04:55.080
Network, we we've hit a milestone this week. Oh, our celebrating turning 19 years old this

04:55.080 --> 05:00.240
week. So this is kind of our official celebration for that. But you guys know, as of several

05:00.280 --> 05:05.720
years ago, we kind of we kind of put the confetti cannons away for every anniversary. It's like

05:05.720 --> 05:13.200
birthdays after twenty one. Like, what's the point? Right. And so. So, yeah. But I mean,

05:13.200 --> 05:16.240
obviously, this is a huge milestone and we did do something special for it. We did a

05:16.240 --> 05:20.120
midweek broadcast and this was a lot of fun. So on Wednesday night, which was the actual

05:20.120 --> 05:24.880
birthday of the show, because the first episode was June twenty third of 2002. So on June

05:24.880 --> 05:29.360
twenty third this week, we actually got together and we listened to episode number one and

05:29.400 --> 05:33.920
we were ready for all the cringe that came with listening to episode number one. But come

05:33.920 --> 05:39.760
to find out, you know, and I hadn't listened to that show in a very long time and I don't

05:39.760 --> 05:46.000
think I haven't listened to it since we did it. Exactly. So I got to say, it wasn't as bad

05:46.000 --> 05:49.040
as I thought it was going to be. And I know that sounds really weird to say, especially

05:49.040 --> 05:52.600
because, you know, we pour our heart and soul into this show and I'm very proud of it. But I

05:52.600 --> 05:57.720
also recognize it's come a long way since the early days. And I was kind of surprised

05:57.720 --> 06:02.880
episode number one was more polished than I expected it to be. Not to say it wasn't a

06:02.880 --> 06:07.880
little bumpy, you know, but I was kind of walked away from that going, that wasn't that bad.

06:07.880 --> 06:12.040
I kind of hyped that up to be a lot worse. And I felt like you guys kind of walked away with

06:12.040 --> 06:19.840
similar opinions on that. So, yeah. Yeah. And I thought there was some very there was some

06:19.840 --> 06:26.200
things in it that were very like, like how OLR still is today. Like the thing I well, there

06:26.200 --> 06:31.160
were two things in it. Number one, and this shocked me. I didn't realize we had a webcam all

06:31.160 --> 06:37.000
the way back on episode one. The one frame webcam. Yep. I knew the I think is even worse than that.

06:37.000 --> 06:43.400
I think it was like one frame every three minutes. But I remember that we had a webcam in the early

06:43.400 --> 06:48.920
days of OLR. I thought we didn't do it until we moved to that second studio that was the apartment

06:48.920 --> 06:52.840
that Loki and I lived in. I didn't think we had a webcam in the first days of the show. So that was

06:52.840 --> 06:58.360
a shock to find out that we've been doing video just about as long as we've been doing OLR

06:58.920 --> 07:03.880
of some sort. I guess there were some gaps in that because we were doing slideshows. Exactly.

07:05.080 --> 07:10.440
Exactly. But then the other thing I thought was very interesting about that whole thing was that

07:10.440 --> 07:15.080
Loki, of course, we all knew Loki was at episode one, even though originally he wasn't there for

07:15.080 --> 07:19.880
the discussion about we should do an Orange Lounge radio. But obviously, Loki put his heart and soul

07:19.880 --> 07:24.920
into it as well from episode one so much that we kind of retconned him to a host from the beginning.

07:24.920 --> 07:29.800
But if you listen to episode one where he wasn't technically a co-host yet, it's really funny

07:29.800 --> 07:34.440
that he's bringing that same perspective of, oh, here's some news stories that we haven't

07:34.440 --> 07:39.240
gotten to yet that we should kind of bring up. And he kind of was helping to throw out some topics

07:39.240 --> 07:43.160
there towards the end of the show. And I'm the one sitting there going, well, maybe maybe the

07:43.160 --> 07:47.080
critics were right. We can't fill two hours talking about Bomani. And Loki was like, well,

07:47.080 --> 07:51.640
what about this? What about this? So I thought that was really surprising, like in a pleasantly

07:51.640 --> 07:56.600
fun kind of way. So, yeah, that was I remember doing that. Yeah, I didn't remember that either.

07:56.600 --> 08:02.520
But it's it's at the same time, I'm not surprised. It's why you're still here. Right. So it's great.

08:02.520 --> 08:09.160
Yeah. Anyhow, TigerClaw in chat says, do you remember how fast your Internet was back in

08:09.160 --> 08:16.440
the days? Was it on dial up? The early O.L.R. was on a DSL connection. So that was blazing fast at

08:16.440 --> 08:22.600
the time. But O.L.R. was also dial up friendly radio when it started on live through 65. So

08:22.600 --> 08:27.640
that's why the recording is not the greatest quality, because it was like it's like something

08:27.640 --> 08:32.840
like 24 Kbps or whatever was dial up friendly at the time. So it's you know, it's it's a pretty

08:32.840 --> 08:37.400
poor quality. But there were a lot of people, especially in remote parts of the country,

08:37.400 --> 08:42.520
that were still on dial up at the time. So it kind of worked out for them. And then some kind

08:42.520 --> 08:47.240
words from the chat. Bobby Black Wolf in chat says it shows how much O.L.R. has changed,

08:47.240 --> 08:53.320
but also how much O.L.R. has stayed the same. Yep. Mr. Rhizos in chat says happy 19th anniversary

08:53.320 --> 08:57.560
O.L.R. Thank you very much. And just a big, you know, thank you again. I know I say this a lot,

08:57.560 --> 09:03.000
but it's because I mean it. Thank you to all of you out there who support the show, who listen,

09:03.000 --> 09:08.280
who say nice things like that. I got some really touching tweets throughout the week this week in

09:08.280 --> 09:13.800
response to O.L.R. turning 19 and such. And I just yeah, I mean, it's it's really the motivation

09:13.800 --> 09:19.080
that keeps things going. So I just I want to give a big thank you to everyone out there that

09:19.080 --> 09:24.840
continues to listen to this. I thought it was hilarious that there were more people

09:25.960 --> 09:29.880
watching that broadcast on Wednesday of us listening to episode one. There were more people

09:29.880 --> 09:34.200
watching that than were actually listening to episode one back in the day. But I'll tell you

09:34.200 --> 09:39.880
what, Dark Tetsuya gets a gold star because he was there for both. He was there for episode and

09:39.880 --> 09:44.120
his name is in episode one because we shouted him out in the chat room, which apparently we had an

09:44.120 --> 09:49.000
IRC chat room in the early show that I read, I think three times throughout the whole show. So

09:49.000 --> 09:54.760
I've gotten better at that. That's for sure. But anyway, I remember you saying that it didn't sound

09:54.760 --> 09:59.560
like we got any at first, but yeah, they came in. That might have been it, too. I feel like the chat

09:59.560 --> 10:05.160
was probably really slow in those early episodes. But Joe Mama was there. Joe Mama was the first

10:05.160 --> 10:10.120
chat comment ever read. So there was that. So it's just kind of funny. Dark Sakura,

10:10.120 --> 10:14.200
Loki, anything you guys want to say about the 19th birthday and all these candles on the cake?

10:16.920 --> 10:22.440
It wasn't that bad. I sounded really sinacy, but I think I always sound really sinacy.

10:22.440 --> 10:27.480
Well, and the poor quality of the recording and the poor microphones, I think kind of-

10:27.480 --> 10:29.000
I don't think that can mimic sinus.

10:30.120 --> 10:32.920
You'd be surprised how horrible it can make your voice sound, but yeah.

10:35.320 --> 10:40.920
But anything on turning 19 years old, not so much episode one, but just this milestone of 19 years,

10:40.920 --> 10:46.680
which we still believe makes us the longest running internet show slash podcast about games

10:46.680 --> 10:52.680
out there, period. Any- I'm officially looking into the Guinness thing.

10:52.680 --> 10:55.400
Yeah, that would be a very nice thing. You have to pay for it.

10:55.400 --> 10:57.400
Yeah, but how much is it? I think it's worth it.

10:57.400 --> 10:59.480
Yeah, we might be able to- if it's only a couple of hundred dollars,

10:59.480 --> 11:02.440
I bet we could just pool it together. I think it's a couple of thousand dollars.

11:02.440 --> 11:06.760
Well, maybe we'll have to just- Maybe we'll take a Kickstarter.

11:06.760 --> 11:10.520
Maybe, maybe. I don't know. Loki, any thoughts on turning 19?

11:11.240 --> 11:18.760
No, it's just another episode. 20 will be really cool. I mean, that'll be really significant.

11:18.760 --> 11:23.080
And no one will realize- no one will know.

11:23.080 --> 11:25.880
Yeah, but I gave up on that at the five-year mark.

11:28.200 --> 11:28.840
Yeah, we'll see.

11:29.880 --> 11:36.040
Phoenix7726 says, will y'all be putting episode one up on the RSS feed again? That's a no.

11:36.840 --> 11:41.800
And the reason why, A, there's copyright music all over it because we used to take music breaks.

11:41.800 --> 11:45.720
Actually, as a quick aside, and Dark Tetsuya, if you're listening, please post that link in

11:45.720 --> 11:51.720
chat that you had in the private thread that only the host can see with the stories every week.

11:51.720 --> 11:56.040
But you put together a YouTube playlist of all the songs from episode one,

11:56.040 --> 11:59.720
and people were asking about that. So Dark Tetsuya, please share that link in chat

12:00.680 --> 12:06.040
because I'd love for the folks that were asking, what were those songs that you were skipping over?

12:06.040 --> 12:08.760
I'd like you guys to have a copy of that. So check that out.

12:08.840 --> 12:19.800
And also just because even though I was pleasantly surprised that nothing was said was as terrible

12:19.800 --> 12:24.520
as I thought it was going to be for the age of the show, there were still a couple things where

12:24.520 --> 12:34.600
I'm like, people looking at that in a 2021 lens without the right frame of mind may not appreciate

12:34.600 --> 12:41.240
it. So I think it's best that it just be kept in the vault. It's not hard to find. I'll tell you

12:41.240 --> 12:46.520
that episode one of OLR is not hard to find, especially if you kind of poke around the old

12:46.520 --> 12:51.720
forums at VOG Network, which they're no longer active or usable, but you can still look at old

12:51.720 --> 12:57.400
posts. You can probably find episode one pretty easy, but I'm just going to stress this. I always

12:57.400 --> 13:03.000
do. Those shows are nearly 20 years old at this point. So just keep that in mind.

13:03.880 --> 13:05.800
So I found the answer.

13:06.600 --> 13:08.440
For which... Oh, the Guinness thing.

13:08.440 --> 13:09.160
For Guinness.

13:09.160 --> 13:10.040
Yes. What is that?

13:10.040 --> 13:17.480
So for a new record, it's $1,000 for a priority application where they process it in five days.

13:17.480 --> 13:22.520
For a standard application, there's no cost and takes up to 12 weeks for it to be reviewed.

13:23.080 --> 13:24.680
And then send us the guidelines.

13:24.680 --> 13:29.400
All right. Well, Dark Soccer, you're in charge of that project. Let's make it happen. I'd love that.

13:29.400 --> 13:31.080
Do we want this to happen, chat?

13:31.080 --> 13:31.720
I think so.

13:34.200 --> 13:38.840
Well, I'll wait to see what chat says. I'm going to do it anyway, but I want to see what they say.

13:38.840 --> 13:45.640
Phoenix7726 says, was there some casual ableism or something? There was an instance of a word

13:45.640 --> 13:49.240
that was used far more often 20 years ago that wasn't...

13:49.240 --> 13:49.960
That wasn't me.

13:49.960 --> 13:55.080
It wasn't... Well, it wasn't any of us. It was actually a guest, but I don't want to deflect on

13:55.080 --> 14:00.200
the guest either because I'm sure in subsequent episodes, it fell out of our mouths too at some

14:00.200 --> 14:06.360
point. But I just want to clearly say it certainly wasn't appropriate then and isn't appropriate now,

14:06.360 --> 14:11.640
but society's rules were a little different. And unfortunately, we have a tendency to parrot things

14:11.640 --> 14:16.920
that we hear on TV and around us and stuff. But I think it was interesting because Dark Soccer,

14:16.920 --> 14:21.160
after we did that, we rated another Twitch streamer. We rated Losing Color, and we were

14:21.160 --> 14:27.160
talking about it in their chat. And I thought there was some very nice chat in there about,

14:27.160 --> 14:31.800
well, if you can look back on that and at least say, wow, that was cringe and I wouldn't do that

14:31.800 --> 14:35.800
again, then it does show growth and that you've learned from it. And I think that's something

14:35.800 --> 14:39.000
to celebrate. And that's really what it was all about, honestly. So...

14:39.000 --> 14:46.920
Yeah. And I mean, in my early days of going into Elsie's channel, by the way, they were like,

14:46.920 --> 14:51.880
oh, tell me all about it and let me go off at length. And then they followed us.

14:51.880 --> 14:56.440
That's great. That's very nice. All right. I think you're seeing some folks in chat that

14:56.440 --> 15:01.160
want to see C.O.L.R. in the Guinness Book of World Records. So we got to make that happen.

15:01.160 --> 15:02.440
I'm creating my account right now.

15:02.440 --> 15:08.600
All right. Okay. Anyhow, let's get into some other gaming topics here. So again,

15:08.600 --> 15:13.080
one more thank you for helping us get to 19 years. Let's push through one more year. Let's

15:13.080 --> 15:19.480
see if we can get to 20. All right. Let's go ahead and get into our top story tonight,

15:19.480 --> 15:26.120
which has to do with Windows 11. Windows 11 was announced this week. Microsoft did a big

15:26.200 --> 15:30.680
to do about that. And you might be wondering, well, what's Windows 11 have to do with gaming?

15:30.680 --> 15:34.120
And I would say, really? You're going to ask that? Because there's a lot of people

15:34.120 --> 15:38.760
that are playing on PC, Windows types of environments. And so, of course,

15:38.760 --> 15:43.000
it's absolutely important what Windows 11 is going to be doing, especially when it comes to

15:43.000 --> 15:48.600
gaming. And I think a lot of people have peered in the crystal ball and kind of thought, hmm,

15:48.600 --> 15:56.840
Microsoft does Windows. Microsoft does Xbox. What is Windows 11 going to do to Xbox?

15:56.840 --> 16:00.520
And sure enough, as part of the Windows 11 announcements earlier this week,

16:01.320 --> 16:06.920
they have announced that Xbox Game Pass will be built into Windows 11. So if you're already subbed,

16:06.920 --> 16:10.120
you can get right in there and play your games in Windows 11. I have to be honest,

16:10.840 --> 16:14.360
isn't it kind of that way with Windows 10? I mean, I understand it is. Yeah,

16:14.360 --> 16:18.840
I understand they're going to make it like it's maybe in Windows 10. It's kind of like a

16:18.840 --> 16:23.880
separate app. It's a separate standalone thing that like like the Steam store or something that

16:23.880 --> 16:28.920
you run. And so I can see that maybe like in Windows 11, it's going to be more integrated.

16:28.920 --> 16:34.200
But I also kind of think this headline is a little bit like, is it going to be that different? I

16:34.200 --> 16:40.760
actually don't. Yeah. That sounds it's more click baity. Maybe a little bit. But I get the point.

16:40.760 --> 16:46.360
I get why it's newsworthy. Integrated verse into the application versus a standalone app

16:46.360 --> 16:50.600
is a difference. It is a different, you know, way to present. But I think for most people,

16:50.600 --> 16:57.480
it's going to feel very similar. But we're not really surprised to see that. But Microsoft kind

16:57.480 --> 17:04.200
of also going out of their way to invite other people into Windows 11 store, probably because

17:04.200 --> 17:08.520
they don't want to be seen as monopolizing the market because, you know, I think Microsoft's

17:08.520 --> 17:12.920
gotten slaps on the wrist before for things like antitrust and things like that. So even though

17:12.920 --> 17:16.920
they're going to be building Game Pass into it, they're kind of going out of their way to say,

17:16.920 --> 17:23.160
we want Steam. We want Epic Game Store. We want other. I think. I think they had even said we

17:23.160 --> 17:27.000
want iMessage. I know that's not about gaming, but they have said these other things. They want

17:27.000 --> 17:34.120
to get these other things integrated into Windows. So in a comment, I was trying to find the keyword

17:34.120 --> 17:42.680
here. Is that who said this? The OS chief Panos Panay mentioned to The Verge in an interview

17:42.680 --> 17:47.240
that Microsoft would like to add these third-party stores, specifically calling out Steam and Epic

17:47.240 --> 17:52.920
Game Stores. And Panay in the interview said these stores would be very welcome.

17:54.040 --> 17:59.640
They want to make Windows 11 a go-to source for app, saying, quote, you type the app in and you

17:59.640 --> 18:06.200
get the app you want. So interesting. It should also be said, though, that Windows 11 does not

18:06.200 --> 18:12.920
plan to charge a fee to have apps listed. However, that doesn't apply to games. There's been a very

18:12.920 --> 18:19.800
interesting, clear distinction between apps are free, games are not. So I don't know how that's

18:19.800 --> 18:24.760
going to work. If they were to try to put Steam in there, then does that mean that Microsoft would

18:24.760 --> 18:29.000
take a cut because it's games? I don't know. I guess they would have some things to work out

18:29.000 --> 18:36.360
there. But considering Steam exists on Windows 10 today and doesn't get a cut, I don't see why,

18:37.240 --> 18:41.560
again, I think it's a question about is it integrated into the system and something you

18:41.560 --> 18:46.360
get right there like on, you know, or is it, you know, a separate app that you launch? And I feel

18:46.360 --> 18:51.160
like things like Steam, Epic Game Store and so forth will just be separate apps that you launch.

18:51.160 --> 18:59.080
So going to comment and chat, TigerCon Chat says, I advise against upgrading to Windows 11.

18:59.080 --> 19:03.560
You may have some hardware that you normally use that probably won't have any Windows 11 drivers

19:03.560 --> 19:07.320
on launch. If there's a piece of hardware you've been using for the last couple years,

19:07.320 --> 19:11.160
you have to check if the manufacturer is still supporting it with Windows 11 drivers.

19:11.960 --> 19:17.480
And Mr. Izos in Chat says, as with new consoles, it's always worth to wait a bit to see how the

19:17.480 --> 19:22.680
existing hardware catches up with Windows to upgrade. Never be on that first all buggy batch.

19:23.960 --> 19:30.680
I probably will not upgrade to Windows 11 on day one, but I hope to be an early-ish adopter.

19:30.680 --> 19:35.320
That is assuming that they don't force it on you. Like, I don't know if this is going to be

19:36.040 --> 19:39.960
because they were talking about Windows 10 being like kind of the last update of Windows that

19:39.960 --> 19:43.960
there's going to be unless they're going to kind of start treating us like, you know,

19:43.960 --> 19:47.800
Mac OS or something like that, where it's just the version numbers are going to keep

19:47.800 --> 19:52.920
going up as it updates. I don't know if they're going to make you name the new ones, Monterey.

19:52.920 --> 19:58.680
Yeah, I understand that. But that's just kind of. I don't know, a formality. I mean,

19:58.680 --> 20:02.360
what I'm saying is, you know, well done branding, it's well done branding. You don't have to

20:02.360 --> 20:09.240
purchase like a brand new install of an OS. It just updates and, you know, whatever you call it,

20:09.240 --> 20:13.080
a different name. Right. But like, I don't know if they're playing on doing that with Windows 11.

20:13.080 --> 20:18.520
If that's the case, if they are, then they're going to shove it right into your face.

20:18.520 --> 20:23.560
They did confirm it's free. So it's it's not and they're going to shove it right into your face.

20:23.560 --> 20:27.560
They'll absolutely shove it in your face. But they did that with Windows 10. It's very easy

20:27.560 --> 20:34.760
to click. Not today, you know, and I want to say with Windows, not not today, Microsoft.

20:35.480 --> 20:42.600
I want to say when they did Windows 10, you could also make a backup of your old OS for like 30

20:42.680 --> 20:48.200
days and revert back at any time, because I think they kind of read the tea leaves on why people

20:48.200 --> 20:52.440
were hesitant to do the upgrade. I think that was a smart thing to do. That was the thing that

20:52.440 --> 20:57.160
finally got me to push the button was when it was like, OK, you can revert back in 30 days if you

20:57.160 --> 21:02.200
don't like it. So they would be very smart to do something like that with Windows 11. And I think

21:02.200 --> 21:09.320
that'll encourage more people to adopt it. So we'll see. Let's see, other comments in chat.

21:09.960 --> 21:16.920
Did you do pod culture and chat says I'm running 11 without issues. Just had to enable TPM in my

21:16.920 --> 21:21.320
BIOS. Thank you. Thank you for being one of the people willing to put up with a buggy piece of

21:21.320 --> 21:25.800
software so that when it comes out for the rest of us, those will all be ironed out. But I'm glad

21:25.800 --> 21:32.120
it's running without issues for you so far. That's great. E3VL in chat says, didn't they force 8 to

21:32.120 --> 21:37.000
10 when it launched? Maybe my memory was fuzzy. I didn't go from 8 to 10. I went from 7 to 10.

21:37.000 --> 21:43.240
But I remember it wasn't forced. So there was that. Yeah, I went from 8 to 10. It wasn't forced,

21:43.240 --> 21:48.120
but like they were kind of basically it was, you know, I hate Windows 8 so much.

21:49.960 --> 21:54.840
Going from 7 to 8 was like kind of a downgrade almost. Yeah. Because that was when they're like,

21:54.840 --> 22:01.960
oh, well, tablets are the future. Everything must be tablet like. So it was a warm welcome to have

22:01.960 --> 22:06.600
another OS to go to aside from 8. So I think that's why a lot of people kind of jump ship

22:06.600 --> 22:12.120
really fast on that. I think so. So to tie it kind of like back to gaming and all that,

22:12.120 --> 22:16.360
I think it's going to be interesting that we have the new OS. And it does feel like it's probably

22:16.360 --> 22:21.720
about time, like it's been a few years. It probably feels like it's about time for a new OS.

22:21.720 --> 22:25.800
But I'm not sure if at the end of the day, our gaming experiences are going to change

22:25.800 --> 22:29.880
that significantly. I mean, yes, they're talking about the Game Pass integration, but or the Game

22:29.880 --> 22:34.120
Pass stuff. I just don't think it's going to play out that differently than what we see in Windows

22:34.120 --> 22:38.440
10 today. It's not like it's going to pre install games or anything like that. At least I hope to

22:38.440 --> 22:42.520
hell it doesn't. I don't think it will, because that would be so rude to your bandwidth. They

22:43.800 --> 22:50.040
did that with the included games with the install before, I think. I can't remember because I

22:50.040 --> 22:53.560
remember like Candy Crush is in there. So that was like an immediate install. But

22:55.320 --> 23:00.600
yeah, hopefully there's not kind of bloatware in there. Obi-Wan Jabroni in chat says, I'm a Mac

23:00.600 --> 23:04.440
user. You're speaking a foreign language. I understand, of course. And I know Dark

23:04.440 --> 23:08.440
Soccer is a big fan of her Mac. And there's certainly nothing wrong with that. But I know

23:08.440 --> 23:13.480
even with Mac, sometimes what goes on with Windows can still kind of affect things in case they get

23:13.480 --> 23:18.280
like this thing you're kind of talking about with the Mass Effect trilogy and the difficulties

23:18.280 --> 23:24.360
it's kind of been up and running getting that. But I would wonder, I think this would be an

23:24.360 --> 23:31.400
extremely smart thing for Microsoft to do is to leverage some of that xCloud stuff like they best

23:31.400 --> 23:37.640
have an xCloud player for the Mac. But I guess that's on Microsoft to figure that out and maybe

23:37.640 --> 23:45.080
perhaps some things on Apple as well. Anyhow, let's go ahead and move on. Can you get Edge on

23:45.080 --> 23:53.960
a Mac? Technically, yes. Yeah. So technically, I think it does run through Edge.

23:55.000 --> 24:00.840
Well, xCloud's on a website, too, right? And I know Chrome's on. I'm running Chrome on this

24:00.840 --> 24:04.280
very Mac that's powering our show. I have to use Chrome to play Stadia.

24:04.280 --> 24:09.240
Yeah. So I was going to say, I'm pretty sure Chrome will do xCloud, too. So that's a very

24:09.240 --> 24:13.640
good point. You're right. They don't even need a native app. It's all going to run through the web,

24:13.640 --> 24:18.920
which is probably what the future is anyway. Oh, and Obi-Wan Jabroni says it works on Safari. Well,

24:18.920 --> 24:25.320
there you go. That's the go-to Mac browser. So it makes sense. Anyhow.

24:25.320 --> 24:29.080
Good. Anything you have to do to prevent no one wants to install Edge.

24:30.920 --> 24:36.760
I don't think Edge is as bad as the last one. But anyway, all right. Let's get into other stuff.

24:36.760 --> 24:41.560
Let's talk about our gaming weeks and what we've been playing on PC, console, or otherwise. And

24:41.560 --> 24:44.440
we'll start off with Dark Sakura with the question, how was your gaming week?

24:45.320 --> 24:50.120
Um, I did not again play Animal Crossing. I have played a lot of Dead by Daylight. I basically,

24:50.760 --> 24:56.120
in just a couple hours a night for about four nights, I got Hag to 40.

24:57.400 --> 25:05.160
Um, I'm now a Hag main. It's amazing. Uh, I actually like Larry's with Hag.

25:06.120 --> 25:09.800
I hate Haddonfield still. It's still garbage. And the corn is still garbage.

25:10.680 --> 25:17.160
But I actually don't mind Larry's or Hawkins. I've tried Hag. I can't do it. She's too slow for me.

25:17.960 --> 25:22.840
And the trap thing is like, for whatever reason, the trap thing for me is so delayed.

25:22.840 --> 25:28.120
Like when I try to trigger the trap, I can't get a hit in. So it's just Hag's run for me.

25:28.120 --> 25:35.960
When I get an explosion alert, I've just got my pinky on my control key the whole time.

25:35.960 --> 25:41.400
Hmm. So, or sorry, my command key. I mean, I'm playing on a Mac, but for you, it would be

25:41.960 --> 25:49.240
what, what button is that? Alt. But anyway, um, and I'm still having some fun with doctor

25:49.240 --> 25:53.400
and I'm still playing piggy sometimes, but I've pretty much been nothing but Hag this last week.

25:53.400 --> 26:01.800
It's been great. Um, so I'm team Hagatha. Um, I also finally, they have updated a windows

26:01.800 --> 26:08.760
arm sufficiently that I can get mass effect to load, but it does not load all the way.

26:08.760 --> 26:15.960
It does not play well. It's still in the very infancy of that, uh, 64 bit emulation

26:17.000 --> 26:25.560
or whatever emulation it wants to use. Um, so I'm still waiting, but it was exciting getting,

26:25.560 --> 26:33.080
getting it to work. I'm actually running the, the, uh, early beta builds for windows arm

26:33.720 --> 26:40.680
and I've been fairly pleased, fairly pleased. Nice. And of course word escapes because I'm

26:40.680 --> 26:49.400
addicted to letters. All right. Uh, Loki, how was your gaming week? It's all Minecraft still. So,

26:50.200 --> 26:57.000
this week's been interesting. I've was trying to set up some content to record for another episode,

26:57.000 --> 27:02.280
had a plan and everything, but then, uh, we decided to update the server to one 17.

27:02.280 --> 27:08.520
So that added a lot of things and totally derailed everything I wanted to do and also broke my

27:08.520 --> 27:14.680
shaders, which I was sad about it at first, but actually I'm kind of getting used to the way it

27:14.680 --> 27:21.000
looks before shaders. Um, and also the frame rates a little bit much better, like 10 times

27:21.000 --> 27:28.520
better. Um, so I've been just messing around with the one 17 stuff, um, new shop designs and stuff.

27:28.520 --> 27:35.560
So I'm going to film that content. And then I think actually that the Optifine has re-enabled

27:35.560 --> 27:40.440
shaders. So probably I need that pretty soon. Sorry, awkward, but I need to do a quick AFK.

27:41.000 --> 27:44.120
Smoosh is wailing. So I need to make sure he's okay. I'll be right back.

27:46.600 --> 27:51.080
He shouldn't be wailing because that's illegal and frowned upon.

27:51.080 --> 27:53.560
What if he's wailing on a guitar doing some sick riffs?

27:54.920 --> 28:02.200
Maybe. I don't know. Um, so yeah, it's been a lot of that. I've been designing an axolotl shop,

28:02.200 --> 28:06.280
so we're going to be selling axolotls in the shopping district now. And it's awesome. You

28:06.280 --> 28:11.960
got to, can't wait to show you the design. It'll be in the new, the new episode. I have a farm now

28:11.960 --> 28:20.440
to get those as well. So I have, I probably have at least 50 to 60 axolotls at the moment. So it's

28:20.440 --> 28:28.520
pretty crazy. Um, but yeah, uh, one, one 17 is pretty awesome. The caves are a lot more

28:28.520 --> 28:33.400
interesting now. Not as interesting as they're going to be in one 18 when that comes out, but

28:33.400 --> 28:39.240
it has been, um, definitely worth getting used to the only downside though so far. And I think it's

28:39.240 --> 28:45.080
a server issue is my entire gold farm that was in there is completely broken, which is unfortunate

28:45.080 --> 28:50.520
because I need that gold farm to run my shop on the server. And that fact that it doesn't work

28:50.520 --> 28:57.160
anymore is a problem. Although no, nothing in the update should have broken that it's, I think it's

28:57.160 --> 29:02.840
more of just something because our server runs paper MC, which is kind of a modded client or

29:02.840 --> 29:08.360
modded server. And there's additional tweaks and stuff that they do in there. The fixed stuff that

29:08.360 --> 29:13.320
you know, maybe broken in vanilla. I think something with that is affecting what's going on.

29:13.320 --> 29:18.120
So I'm trying to get the admins to look into that. But in the meantime, I'm also setting up a cash

29:18.120 --> 29:22.680
for gold shop instead, you know, like those old commercials we used to see all the time.

29:23.560 --> 29:25.880
I'm back smooshes. Okay. Thank you. Okay.

29:26.600 --> 29:31.880
Glad he's not wailing. So yeah, it's been just lots of Minecraft stuff. So I'm hopefully going

29:31.880 --> 29:39.240
to be working on stuff for another episode soon. I'm trying to get it down to one episode a week.

29:39.240 --> 29:43.160
I mean, listening to the folks come behind the scenes on like the hermitcraft stuff,

29:43.160 --> 29:48.680
they said that it takes about eight hours to film, edit and publish an episode for them.

29:48.680 --> 29:52.840
And it's taken me way longer to do that. Like I'm having way more footage like there's

29:52.840 --> 29:55.640
when they were talking about like, Oh, yeah, I have to go through an hour and a half worth

29:55.640 --> 30:03.160
of footage. And that's a lot. Like, I'm going through a good 10 times the amount of footage

30:03.160 --> 30:08.360
than they are. So I'm doing something wrong. So I need to kind of refine that process. But

30:09.480 --> 30:13.160
hopefully we'll have a new episode soon. I don't want it to be two weeks, but maybe in the middle

30:13.160 --> 30:17.080
of the week. Well, that's part of the learning process, though. And another quick plug for

30:17.080 --> 30:21.640
because I don't think you put that if I, you know, what is time anymore? But I seem to remember

30:21.640 --> 30:25.880
that your big collaboration video went up on Monday, so the day after our last show. So a big

30:25.880 --> 30:29.240
shout out to go follow your YouTube channel to check out your latest video.

30:30.040 --> 30:34.200
Yeah, it's up there. I think it was last Sunday or something like that. But yeah, there's a there's

30:34.200 --> 30:39.320
a lot. My last video with Tango Tech from hermitcraft. They're in the middle of season

30:39.320 --> 30:43.880
eight right now. So it's pretty awesome. But I got to collaborate with him a little bit and

30:43.880 --> 30:49.720
just kind of talk about his process and stuff. And we started working on just something. I mean,

30:49.720 --> 30:53.400
off the cuff, it's kind of hard to build, especially with it, you know, I was super

30:53.400 --> 30:57.880
nervous. So it's hard to kind of come up with something offline, though, I've been able to

30:57.880 --> 31:01.480
come up with something much grander, which will be in probably a future episode, but

31:01.480 --> 31:05.720
it'll be inspired by what we kind of started there. It was still a fun experience. So I would

31:05.720 --> 31:11.400
I totally recommend you watch it and give me a like and subscribe and all that fun stuff.

31:11.400 --> 31:17.960
All right, we will. Let's see my gaming week. I honestly didn't play a lot of new stuff still

31:17.960 --> 31:23.560
going on the day of the daylight. I had to play the Debbie Delight. The Debbie Delight. I played

31:23.560 --> 31:32.520
some Nemesis. Hey, Nemesis. Yeah. Did you whip it out? I did. I wish the whip length was a

31:32.520 --> 31:39.800
little bit longer. I wish it was a little bit faster. Yeah. And that's so that's taken some

31:39.800 --> 31:43.640
getting taken some getting used to. But I was finally able to get that daily done where it's

31:43.640 --> 31:48.040
like you have to max out. You have to play four times to get it done because it's max out your

31:48.040 --> 31:53.560
meter like four times. So I did that. You can just do it by hitting zombies. I. Yeah, but it's so

31:53.560 --> 31:57.560
much slower that way. Like it's better to just do a survivor and get them in a chase, but you have

31:57.560 --> 32:01.800
to get so close and then do it because you can try to risk it from a little further back, but you

32:01.800 --> 32:07.720
might not hit them. But my other big day by daylight accomplishment is I got Jill to 40.

32:07.720 --> 32:12.200
So I got my blast mine teachable finally. So I'm probably going to move on to another character.

32:12.200 --> 32:16.600
I'll probably do Jake next because I really want Iron Will. So, yeah, I've been working on those.

32:16.600 --> 32:20.600
I should probably do a stream of that at some point because I talk about all the time. But

32:20.600 --> 32:25.880
whenever I stream, it's usually playing Final Fantasy 14, which, by the way, just as an aside,

32:25.880 --> 32:29.400
because I just realized it's not in tonight's show role and maybe it should have been.

32:29.400 --> 32:33.960
They're doing a very interesting promotion with Final Fantasy 14 right now where you can get a

32:33.960 --> 32:40.520
special black chocobo. It's specifically the fat chocobo. You can get a flying mount black fat

32:40.520 --> 32:51.960
chocobo if you have to watch certain Final Fantasy 14 streamers and give four subs. And if you donate

32:51.960 --> 32:57.960
four subs while watching particular Final Fantasy 14 streamers, then you get the black fat chocobo.

32:58.600 --> 33:02.840
And this is causing a little bit of controversy in the community because the list of who they

33:02.840 --> 33:07.880
curated. Again, I don't want to talk negative about any of those people, but it could have

33:07.880 --> 33:14.200
probably shown a little more diversity. And quite frankly, in my opinion, I don't understand why

33:14.200 --> 33:19.880
it's limited to begin with. And I'm not trying to be salty or whatever. How dare I wasn't included?

33:19.880 --> 33:23.800
No, I mean, I stream the game once every two weeks. Of course, I'm not going to be included

33:23.800 --> 33:29.400
in something like that, but I don't understand why they don't just open it up to anyone streaming

33:29.400 --> 33:35.800
the game. Usually when you're talking about No Man's Sky giveaways in that game, it was anybody

33:35.800 --> 33:40.280
who's broadcasting it. When it was things like World of Warcraft and Overwatch, it was anybody

33:40.280 --> 33:46.120
who's broadcasting it. So I'm not sure what the thought process there was to limiting it to

33:46.120 --> 33:51.000
certain streamers. And again, I promise you, I'm not trying to talk negative about any streamers.

33:51.000 --> 33:56.120
I'm sure those streamers work very hard, but the problem is not who they included. The problem is

33:56.120 --> 34:03.960
who they left out. And there's some big problems with who they left out. And so that's an issue.

34:03.960 --> 34:06.760
But anyway, I needed to bring that up at some point because I just realized it's not on the

34:06.760 --> 34:11.160
show role because I don't know if any big sites actually reported on that. I think it was more

34:11.160 --> 34:16.120
of a Twitter thing. So there's that. But I have been playing Final Fantasy XIV and I did hit a

34:16.120 --> 34:23.560
big milestone in that game. I have gotten my warrior class past level 50, which means every

34:23.560 --> 34:30.760
job I have past level 50, which was the realm reborn cap. So I have my crown because that was

34:30.760 --> 34:35.880
an achievement in a realm reborn was if you got everything to max level, which was 50 at the time,

34:35.880 --> 34:43.800
your character got a red crown. So I can get that now for glamour and walk everywhere with a crown.

34:43.800 --> 34:51.160
So I can't wait to get them all to 60. I have three jobs left that aren't 80. Warrior,

34:51.240 --> 34:57.720
Monk, and Black Mage. Black Mage is 73. That's real close. The other two are lagging behind in

34:57.720 --> 35:02.520
the 50s. So I'm really going to work this week and the upcoming weeks and have everything 80

35:02.520 --> 35:08.120
well in advance of the new expansion. I'm going back to what I was talking about with XIV. Bobby

35:08.120 --> 35:13.000
Blackwolf says, one of the streamers is part of GDQ and said that he was only told to expect just

35:13.000 --> 35:18.360
a few subs. And he basically went on for hours and made lots of money. The subs were rolling in

35:18.360 --> 35:21.960
and he was already a partner. Well, yeah, they don't want to, they don't want to set expectations

35:21.960 --> 35:27.960
inappropriately, but of course these folks are going to get a ton of subs. People want shit in

35:27.960 --> 35:33.320
Final Fantasy XIV. It's the biggest MMO right now. You know, of course people want to have that. If

35:33.320 --> 35:39.080
Blizzard did this for wow, the exact same thing would happen. It's just weird that they didn't

35:39.080 --> 35:44.280
foresee that. I don't know, whatever. Anyway, Misha Kha earlier was talking about playing

35:44.280 --> 35:51.320
Palace of the Dead, which is a very good way to level up DPS alts. I might actually do some of

35:51.320 --> 35:55.640
that with my monk. Warrior, you can kind of queue for dungeons over and over because you're not

35:55.640 --> 36:00.600
waiting long as a tank. But yeah, Palace of the Dead is a really good way to grind experience

36:01.960 --> 36:07.640
in the lower levels, especially. So, all right. I think that's really about it for my gameplay.

36:07.640 --> 36:11.240
Honestly, Dead by Daylight, Final Fantasy XIV, maybe a little bit of stuff on console,

36:11.240 --> 36:17.400
but nothing more than like an hour. So, all right. I was gone all weekend anyway. So, all right.

36:18.120 --> 36:20.120
By the way, it's submitted.

36:21.400 --> 36:22.200
That was fast.

36:23.400 --> 36:25.160
Yeah, I work quick, quickly.

36:25.160 --> 36:29.400
I'm surprised we didn't have to like, did you have to provide any documentation or anything else?

36:29.400 --> 36:30.280
Do they just follow up?

36:30.920 --> 36:34.840
They just follow up. Although I don't know why this is saying I'm in Uganda. Let me fix that.

36:35.480 --> 36:37.960
Okay. Yeah. I've never been there.

36:37.960 --> 36:43.240
That would be unfortunate if we get in the book and then oops, we were credited to the

36:43.240 --> 36:49.560
wrong country. That would be unfortunate. Anyway. All right. Let's move on and get into some other

36:49.560 --> 36:53.640
gaming news and we'll start with Loki with what's going on in the gaming world this week.

36:54.360 --> 37:00.680
Yeah. So, apparently, Final Fantasy is getting an animated series. So,

37:00.680 --> 37:04.840
Final Fantasy IX to be exact because there's been lots of different Final Fantasy animated series.

37:05.640 --> 37:11.480
But yeah, this is pretty interesting. Kind of weird though that they picked Final Fantasy IX

37:11.480 --> 37:19.000
being it's been so long since it's come out to actually do a series for it. But I don't know.

37:19.000 --> 37:25.240
I guess they're doing it. So, apparently, this is going to be done by Cyber Group Studios.

37:25.960 --> 37:29.960
They're also going to be doing different merchandising and licensing to go along with it

37:29.960 --> 37:36.840
as well. I'm not sure where this is going to be featured yet. I'm wondering if that's going to be

37:36.840 --> 37:43.880
on a streaming service at some point. But it'd be cool to check it out whenever it actually makes

37:43.880 --> 37:49.560
it out. Yeah. I was kind of surprised to hear Final Fantasy IX. Well, I mean, I am and I'm not

37:49.560 --> 37:57.000
because Final Fantasy IX's world and characters kind of lend itself well to that sort of thing.

37:57.000 --> 38:01.800
So, I mean, it's not like they can't do one for Final Fantasy X, but I get it with IX.

38:01.800 --> 38:08.520
But you're right. It is interesting why that one, especially when Seven's got the remake and all

38:08.520 --> 38:12.840
this other stuff. And surely, they're going to want to push Final Fantasy XVI eventually.

38:13.560 --> 38:17.880
But maybe for whatever reason, they just decided this is the one that has the best story to tell.

38:19.400 --> 38:26.040
Yeah. I mean, I guess. I mean, they're targeting this right now. It's supposed to be adapted for

38:26.040 --> 38:34.120
a target audience of eight to 13 year olds. So that'll be interesting. A whole new audience

38:34.120 --> 38:39.560
for Final Fantasy IX. Some comments in chat. DJ Rama S says, as long as it's not Final Fantasy VIII,

38:39.560 --> 38:48.840
that's the worst Final Fantasy. While your shade is on point with me, here's the thing. I do think

38:48.840 --> 38:52.760
VIII had a good story, though. It's just I didn't care for the game in VIII. So if they wanted to

38:52.760 --> 38:57.000
animate VIII, then cool, because I wouldn't have to play it. And the cutscenes are amazing in VIII,

38:57.000 --> 39:02.040
so I'm good with that being animated. That's where I'm at, but I appreciated the shade.

39:02.760 --> 39:07.400
Let's see. Zen Monkey says it's probably because it's the easiest to animate because they're so

39:07.400 --> 39:15.560
small. That makes sense. Quest Buster says Final Fantasy IX is pretty family friendly.

39:15.560 --> 39:21.000
Final Fantasy IX is pretty friendly Final Fantasy for a cartoon like this. Say friendly Final

39:21.000 --> 39:26.680
Fantasy. Family friendly Final Fantasy. Barring a few changes, it should work out and be pretty

39:26.680 --> 39:33.720
interesting. Yeah, I'm super curious about it. I think as you referred to there, Loki,

39:33.720 --> 39:38.840
it's not the only thing that's getting a TV show because there's that Final Fantasy XIV TV show

39:38.840 --> 39:43.080
that we're supposed to be getting as well. That's not animated, but that was the thing because that's

39:43.080 --> 39:47.880
by the same studio that does The Witcher and all that stuff. That'll be interesting. It'll be

39:47.880 --> 39:52.840
awesome, but we haven't heard anything on it in some time. But granted, all the early announcements

39:52.840 --> 39:59.480
were right before the pandemic. I'm sure that has slowed the plans down significantly. So I get it.

39:59.480 --> 40:04.280
But I just know that that's the thing that's kind of like in the works as well. Tiger Kong chat says

40:04.280 --> 40:10.200
why not animate the first Final Fantasy? Do a series based on the first game that started it all.

40:10.200 --> 40:13.960
You know, that's an interesting game coming out. Yeah, I was just gonna say there's a game coming

40:13.960 --> 40:19.160
out. You have that Final Fantasy origin and chaos, chaos, chaos. Well, chaos was

40:20.280 --> 40:26.920
a villain in Final Fantasy I. Also, Final Fantasy I didn't really have set protagonists.

40:27.480 --> 40:32.600
Remember, you got to pick your party and who was in the party and whatever names you wanted

40:32.600 --> 40:38.360
to give them. So the character design didn't really start until Final Fantasy II, which had

40:38.360 --> 40:43.080
more defined characters. And I mean, Final Fantasy II on the NES actually had, you know, characters

40:43.080 --> 40:47.080
that you played. It's just the job system was different. But Final Fantasy I was really,

40:47.800 --> 40:52.280
the warriors of light could kind of be anybody. And so that might be, I mean, and sure, sure,

40:52.280 --> 40:58.040
for the purposes of a story, give them defined roles. Make a black mage named whatever, a white,

40:58.040 --> 41:02.840
you know, make, make those characters. But I want to say, wasn't there a Final Fantasy anime a long

41:02.840 --> 41:07.480
time ago that explored that already? It was based on V. It was based on Final Fantasy V. I don't

41:07.480 --> 41:16.120
remember what, it wasn't called Final Fantasy, I don't think. It was like Legend of the Crystals

41:16.120 --> 41:22.040
or something like that. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm trying to remember. Oh, no, it was, yeah,

41:22.040 --> 41:28.040
Legend of the Crystals, Final Fantasy. That's what it was. So, yeah, I just think, not bad. Yeah,

41:28.040 --> 41:31.720
I just think that might be the issue with trying to go all the way out to Final Fantasy I. And

41:31.720 --> 41:36.440
as was said earlier there, they're going the game direction with that anyway. So maybe they just,

41:36.440 --> 41:39.720
you know, since they have 15 Final Fantasy games, they're going to branch them out in all these

41:39.720 --> 41:44.520
different directions. Where's the justice for Final Fantasy XI? Are they ever going to revisit

41:44.520 --> 41:52.120
Final Fantasy XI? That's, that's my question at this point. Well, yeah, I don't know. Yeah.

41:54.280 --> 41:59.960
Can we get a Dissida, like, anime or something like that? That would be interesting. No One

41:59.960 --> 42:04.440
Special. That would be weird. That would be interesting. No One Special 77 in chat says,

42:04.440 --> 42:08.440
with Final Fantasy I character names, they were limited to four characters a piece,

42:08.440 --> 42:13.400
really limiting in English, but in Japanese, you can do more with the characters. So it was one of

42:13.400 --> 42:21.160
those things that just didn't localize as well, especially for an old NES cart. So, Fifth Dream

42:21.160 --> 42:26.680
in chat says, still waiting for the spirits within game. I, I still will die on the hill that spirits

42:26.680 --> 42:30.040
within should have been Final Fantasy VIII and Final Fantasy VIII should have been the movie.

42:30.040 --> 42:36.280
That's, I will find me a hill to go die on because that's it. So, all right. Anyway,

42:36.920 --> 42:42.520
let's move on. Talk about another big Square series. How about the Mana series? And it's kind

42:42.520 --> 42:47.160
of interesting because we've been kind of seeing more Mana games pop up, right? We had the secret

42:47.160 --> 42:51.800
amount of remake not that long ago, Trials of Mana finally localized after all these years,

42:51.800 --> 42:56.840
and then it gets a remake as well. Legend of Mana, for better or for worse, in my opinion,

42:57.400 --> 43:05.080
that remake just hit, right? So, what's happening with Mana next? Well, get this, producer Masaru

43:05.080 --> 43:12.440
Oyamata confirmed during the 30th anniversary live stream that just happened that a new Mana series

43:12.440 --> 43:17.880
game for console is in development. I think they also announced one for phones and people were kind

43:17.880 --> 43:23.640
of like, but there is one for consoles that is in development. And say, it's saying in the

43:23.640 --> 43:28.440
announcement, we wanted to announce it by running a cool trailer, but we're only at the start of

43:28.440 --> 43:34.200
the 30th anniversary, but we are in fact developing a new title, but please wait a little while longer

43:34.200 --> 43:39.960
until the proper announcement. Although we did have the Mana series creator, Kochi Ishii, take

43:39.960 --> 43:44.600
a look at it a little bit ago. We're at that level of development, so please look forward to it.

43:44.600 --> 43:49.000
Development still has some way to go. We're developing for console, so I hope you can look

43:49.000 --> 43:54.440
forward to it. So meaning, don't expect the game anytime soon. This is probably, honestly, a 2023

43:54.440 --> 44:01.480
game if nothing else. But still exciting to hear that because the Mana series has been doing so

44:01.480 --> 44:06.760
well in the remakes, not only do we finally get second at set to three after all these years

44:06.760 --> 44:12.440
localized, but essentially we're getting second at set to five after all these years is basically

44:12.440 --> 44:18.760
what they're making. And that's outstanding news. I have high hopes for this. What do you guys

44:18.760 --> 44:25.080
think about a new Mana game coming? As long as it isn't like Trials of Mana. I'm not Trials of Mana,

44:25.080 --> 44:32.760
but the last one. Legend of Mana. Legend of Mana, yeah. Which I kind of stupidly got in Japanese.

44:33.640 --> 44:40.840
Oh, I remember the story. Yeah. Yeah, and I just, I didn't enjoy it. I'm gonna be honest. I kind of

44:40.840 --> 44:46.120
want to give it another go. I kind of, because I remember I really didn't like it on PlayStation

44:46.120 --> 44:51.080
when it came out, but I can also admit it came out during a very different period in my life

44:51.080 --> 44:54.520
when what I was looking for in gaming was a little bit different and I was a little more maybe

44:54.520 --> 45:01.320
tunnel visioned. And so there is a part of me that wants to give it another go. So I'm on the fence,

45:01.320 --> 45:06.200
you guys. Send me, convince me. Send me your best tweet. Convince me to play Legend of Mana and give

45:06.200 --> 45:11.880
the remake a try. Twitter.com slash Mr. Rob Roberts. How's that for a cheap plug? Love that.

45:12.440 --> 45:16.600
All right. Also, and I thought this was interesting because, and Jason kind of referenced

45:16.600 --> 45:21.640
it in tonight's intro. He messaged me before the show. I hadn't heard this, but when he was putting

45:21.640 --> 45:27.720
the show roll together, he said, did you know they actually mentioned that there is also a

45:27.720 --> 45:33.800
Legend of Mana, the teardrop crystal anime that's in the works. So there was a lot coming out of

45:33.800 --> 45:39.400
this Mana 30th anniversary stream. And here we go. And we just talked about a Final Fantasy anime.

45:39.480 --> 45:44.200
Guess what? Legend of Mana is getting an anime as well. And it doesn't really matter how I feel

45:44.200 --> 45:48.840
about the game because animes aren't games. They're very different. Again, it could be a

45:48.840 --> 45:54.040
very interesting way to tell the story. So it will be developed. It's going to be animated by

45:54.040 --> 45:59.880
Graffinica. I hope I said that right. In collaboration with Yokohama Animation Lab.

45:59.880 --> 46:05.960
No release date yet, but producer Masaru Oyamata said about it. When the animation project was

46:05.960 --> 46:09.960
first pitched to me, the remastering of Legend of Mana was not even in discussion.

46:09.960 --> 46:14.440
I initially attended the meeting without deep thoughts, but when Mr. Iwata from Warner Brothers

46:14.440 --> 46:18.600
Japan passionately pitched the Legend of Mana animation project with so much love,

46:18.600 --> 46:24.200
I realized I needed to create the game as soon as I can. So rumor has it, that's how the HD

46:24.200 --> 46:30.120
remaster project began. That's very interesting. Fans of the Legend of Mana, please be assured

46:30.120 --> 46:35.480
the people involved in the project have lots of love for the series. So that's pretty cool.

46:35.560 --> 46:40.680
That's very interesting that the discussion about the anime led to the game getting re-released

46:40.680 --> 46:46.040
after all. I just figured the Trials of Mana, the Secret of Mana and like those remakes just

46:46.040 --> 46:53.560
performed very well. So I guess my last question is, where's justice for Secret of Evermore? Look,

46:54.600 --> 47:00.440
look, Secret of Evermore, AKA, I think I have the cart around somewhere too. It's like one of the

47:00.440 --> 47:07.080
few carts I still have. More like Secret of Nevermore. Look, look, justice for Square USA,

47:07.080 --> 47:13.720
okay? Secret of Evermore was not as bad as everyone says it was. Like, I thought it was a,

47:13.720 --> 47:20.360
it was, I mean, was it the same? No, but I like the gameplay was very heavily inspired by

47:20.360 --> 47:23.960
Secret of Mana. And I liked the different direction that it went in. I kind of liked

47:23.960 --> 47:28.440
that it was set in a more modern day, you know, kind of setting a more relatable real world

47:28.440 --> 47:33.720
setting I thought was really cool. So yeah, where's my justice for Secret of Evermore?

47:33.720 --> 47:38.360
You're doing all these other remasters. Come on, come on, at least, at least put it on virtual

47:38.360 --> 47:45.640
console if nothing else. Anyway, DJ Rama S in chat highlights a message saying, Secret of Evermore

47:45.640 --> 47:51.800
goes on the shelf with Final Fantasy Mystic Quest. Well, then here I am walking up to DJ Rama S's

47:51.800 --> 47:56.680
shelf and taking those games off the shelf and putting them in my Super Nintendo to play Secret

47:56.680 --> 48:01.320
of Evermore and to listen to the music in Mystic Quest because that's really the only good part,

48:01.320 --> 48:08.200
but it still had really good music, okay? I'll play that game just to hear the music.

48:09.320 --> 48:13.960
Is there any, is there any game that you will play even though you don't really care for the game

48:13.960 --> 48:19.800
just to hear the music? Chat or hosts, any game that you don't really care for the game,

48:19.800 --> 48:21.960
but the music's so good, you'll play it anyway.

48:24.920 --> 48:32.040
Orange Wright says, Sonic R. I actually like Sonic R. Have fun with it.

48:33.560 --> 48:38.280
Bobby Blackwell says, Advent Rising. Oh, that's a good one. The early Xbox game. Heck yeah,

48:38.280 --> 48:44.520
Quest Buster agrees with that. Obi Wan Jibroni, Streets of Rage 2. Good call. I don't think those

48:44.520 --> 48:48.280
Streets of Rage games have aged very well. Personally, it's a personal opinion, but the

48:48.280 --> 48:54.120
soundtracks, chef's kiss. I want a new Xenogears game. Is that something that we can do?

48:56.760 --> 49:04.760
Write a letter, tweet. We can try. E3VL. All these old Square franchises. I mean, why not?

49:05.400 --> 49:11.880
E3VL in chat says, why not just listen to the OST? Look, I don't need your facts and analysis right

49:11.880 --> 49:17.240
now. I don't need your simple solution. Let me do it the complicated way.

49:19.960 --> 49:24.440
I can think of a game, I really enjoyed the game, but it was hard as balls. And that was Solstice

49:24.440 --> 49:30.040
on the NES. And it had the most amazing soundtrack. I never got very far in the game,

49:30.040 --> 49:34.600
but I would play it just to hear the music. That's for sure. And especially back in the day when a

49:34.600 --> 49:38.760
lot of these games released, we weren't getting OSTs. I think that's also a big part of it.

49:39.640 --> 49:43.880
That was a Japan only thing. We didn't get them over here. And streaming media wasn't a thing

49:43.880 --> 49:49.800
yet. Hell, Napster wasn't a thing yet back when I first played Mystic Quest, that's for sure.

49:51.240 --> 49:59.400
I had friends that would make me cassette tapes of different soundtracks. I would get anime and

49:59.400 --> 50:04.680
video game mix tapes. Didn't you do that on the internet? You dumped some stuff to the internet,

50:04.680 --> 50:10.920
like the early... Was it Bust a Move? Bust a Move. I dumped the track rips from Bust a Move.

50:10.920 --> 50:13.880
I thought that was the thing I remember you talking about in an earlier episode,

50:13.880 --> 50:19.720
way earlier episode. Yeah. So fun. I had what I think it was like a PSX viewer

50:20.520 --> 50:30.200
that lets you view the raw data on a PlayStation game disc. So that's how we also got all those

50:31.080 --> 50:37.640
Symphony of the Night quote lines and everything. That's how they found the unused evil Maria ending.

50:38.600 --> 50:43.480
Actually, now that I think about it, since it just got brought up, I will shut the fuck up

50:43.480 --> 50:49.080
completely about Secret of Evermore getting a remake if Square Enix will bring back Bust a Move.

50:50.680 --> 50:56.600
Because that was an Enix thing. So I'll give up my Secret of Evermore if it means a new Bust a Move.

50:56.600 --> 51:03.080
How about that? Let's move on. Dark Sakura, what else do we have? This is a really interesting

51:03.080 --> 51:18.920
story. So rightfully so, there's a lot of voice actors in arms over the advent of the AI voice

51:18.920 --> 51:29.480
actor. They're like, for example, Witcher 3, A Night to Remember has new voice lines, but it was

51:29.480 --> 51:43.000
used, well, that is it was done by a modder using basically a speech parody was what he calls it,

51:43.880 --> 51:55.080
that he was able to use an AI trained on the original voice actor's speech to create

51:55.080 --> 52:05.400
new lines. And so several voice actors are like, this is terrible. And a quote from Jay Britten,

52:05.400 --> 52:14.840
who was a voice actor on Divinity Original Sin 2 and Pathfinder. I'll go ahead and read the quote.

52:14.840 --> 52:19.400
Yes, AI might be able to replace things, but should it? We literally get to decide. Replacing

52:19.400 --> 52:28.760
actors with AI is not only a legal minefield, but an utterly soulless choice. And this basically came

52:28.760 --> 52:38.280
out after Obsidian, the developer, put a video out about it working with a semantic, which has

52:38.280 --> 52:47.000
AI voices for placeholders until the voice actors are decided on to do their lines. That way,

52:47.560 --> 52:54.360
they can use it to check out dialogue, to check conversation flow, to do base animation,

52:54.600 --> 53:04.760
to the cadence of speech. And one of the voice actors, though, from Assassin's Creed Valhalla,

53:04.760 --> 53:11.880
Natalie Winter, her quote, though, is she says, there's this knee jerk concern of it's going to

53:11.880 --> 53:17.720
take our jobs. And I do believe in some cases that will happen. It's sad to think if AI voices become

53:17.720 --> 53:23.640
good enough to be widely used, then those opportunities will decrease again. And that's

53:23.640 --> 53:33.160
referring to the tight, tight competition as a video game voice actor. The modern question,

53:33.160 --> 53:37.080
though, who didn't like to remember, said he used software called Cyber Voice to create the

53:37.080 --> 53:44.680
new dialogue and the lines for Geralt. It's put out by a Russian company called Mind Simulation

53:44.680 --> 53:56.440
Lab. And they often use that software to mimic many voices. It's really,

54:00.200 --> 54:07.000
I would say, a very gray area right now, although a semantics CEO, Zina Qureshi,

54:08.760 --> 54:13.160
said, and this is her quote, if actors are not comfortable with something, then it's a no go. We

54:13.160 --> 54:18.440
take misuse very seriously. I'm sorry, that came actually. My apologies. I think that came from.

54:21.880 --> 54:29.160
Yeah, actually, that did come from her, so I'm sorry. But at any rate, they reached out to

54:29.160 --> 54:38.360
one of the spokespeople. And this is from an input magazine, by the way, from SAG-AFTRA Union about

54:38.360 --> 54:46.760
how it would affect an actor's credit. And they replied in email, it would be ultimately up to

54:46.760 --> 54:51.960
the actor as currently video game companies do not have a right to continue using a performer's voice

54:51.960 --> 54:57.800
to create something new without their permission. So it would be so SAG-AFTRA would negotiate for

54:57.800 --> 55:05.720
fair compensation if that came to the line. But there's nothing that prohibits anyone from

55:05.720 --> 55:17.960
synthesizing any voice. And indeed, some of these places are calling it parody to, I guess,

55:17.960 --> 55:26.440
get around. They're doing that to get away with it. Exactly. And on top of that, they're saying

55:26.440 --> 55:32.200
that no AI is perfect. You're not going to get spontaneity out of the voice or the essence of

55:32.200 --> 55:39.960
humanity as one quote. But I don't know, when I watched that video that was put out by Semantic,

55:40.760 --> 55:50.440
it was pretty expressive. And they're like, now we have screaming and this, that, and the other.

55:54.120 --> 55:59.480
But they're still thinking that it's a diminishment of their craft.

56:00.280 --> 56:07.480
I'm kind of with SAG-AFTRA on that. Yeah. And personally, now I look at it like this.

56:08.600 --> 56:20.200
Say that you have a finely woven Turkish rug, right? And the ones that take the thousands of

56:20.200 --> 56:27.720
dollars, they take up to a year to create. Now imagine you buy a rug that looks identical,

56:27.720 --> 56:33.400
that was just made in some factory. After a while, you're going to be able, you know,

56:33.400 --> 56:37.640
you're going to hear, see degradation. You're going to hear degradation in the quality.

56:38.360 --> 56:46.200
And it's not, you would probably have to put more work into tweaking the vocal output to make it

56:46.200 --> 56:53.800
sound actually human than you would to pay your voice actor. And voice actors do not get paid as

56:53.800 --> 56:59.880
handsomely as one might think. And I know Quest Buster is bringing up a Vocaloids 2.0. This is

56:59.880 --> 57:10.280
completely different. Vocaloids are meant to sound digital. It is a synthesized voice. This is

57:10.280 --> 57:18.360
actually meant to completely mimic a human voice. And on top of that, certain human voices.

57:19.160 --> 57:23.320
I completely understand where SAG-AFTRA is coming from though, in saying that basically,

57:23.400 --> 57:28.200
and I think that the point for me is really the part where you don't have permission to use the

57:28.200 --> 57:33.240
voice actor's voice beyond what they were compensated for. So I mean, if a developer

57:33.240 --> 57:38.840
wants to keep using the voice and they're going to use this, you know, AI stuff to do it, then okay,

57:38.840 --> 57:44.600
but you need to compensate that voice actor. Now, I think that's being said, I think it's important

57:44.600 --> 57:49.320
to understand the perspective of this story is that you have an individual modder who kind of

57:49.320 --> 57:54.120
did this. This isn't like, it's not like CD Projekt RED did this. They didn't do that.

57:54.120 --> 57:59.880
And on top of that, they're anonymous. Yeah. So I kind of think just the good,

57:59.880 --> 58:04.680
decent thing to do, if you're an anonymous modder, who's going to do this kind of thing and put it

58:04.680 --> 58:09.160
out for free on the internet, I think if you go and make money off it, you're setting yourself

58:09.160 --> 58:14.280
up for trouble. If you're giving it away for free, I think you need to carry that disclaimer

58:14.280 --> 58:19.560
that says these voices are, you know, manipulated or whatever, you know, whatever the,

58:20.120 --> 58:23.080
an appropriate language would be there. I don't- Synthesized, I would say.

58:23.080 --> 58:28.600
Yeah. Synthesized or artificial. But I also completely, I know people may strongly disagree

58:28.600 --> 58:33.880
with me and say, Rob, it's not appropriate in any situation, but I'm also saying you're absolutely

58:33.880 --> 58:38.520
right, but that's not a realistic outlook on how the internet works. So if the technology is out

58:38.520 --> 58:42.760
there, people are going to use it. So we kind of need to find that common ground of especially

58:42.760 --> 58:48.600
the free modding stuff, what should they do? And I think a disclaimer is probably appropriate.

58:49.160 --> 58:53.240
Companies should use this under no circumstance, unless they're going to compensate the

58:53.960 --> 58:57.800
voice actors. And even- Well, it is impressive,

58:58.840 --> 59:08.760
you know, and I think that, I mean, we use a synthesized voice almost every day with,

59:09.320 --> 59:17.880
be it Siri or Alexa or Waze, you know, when you're using their mappy thing.

59:19.560 --> 59:23.560
Synthesized voice is all around us and the technology is getting better and better.

59:25.080 --> 59:33.400
I was listening to some of the synthesis that they did for WWDC for, you know, how Siri is

59:33.400 --> 59:42.840
supposed to sound in the future. And it was utterly amazing. I really think that with any

59:42.840 --> 59:48.600
technology, there's always room for abuse. And I also think that any company is going to try to

59:48.600 --> 59:57.320
save themselves some money when they can. At the same time, they need to be completely aware of the

59:57.320 --> 01:00:02.680
muck that they're stepping into. Right. Interesting perspective in chat.

01:00:02.680 --> 01:00:06.440
So a pod culture in chat says it would be great for things like Star Trek,

01:00:06.440 --> 01:00:12.520
where Majeel as the voice of the Enterprise is no longer with us. I support that if they're

01:00:12.520 --> 01:00:19.000
compensating her estate by continuing to use the voice. That's different. If her estate agrees to

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:23.000
it and says, yes, this is a nice way to carry the tradition and here's the coin we're going to get

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:30.040
from that, then I think it's OK. And it's not that different from movies that used footage of

01:00:30.040 --> 01:00:35.560
Marlon Brando to get him back in the Superman movie after he's been gone for years and years,

01:00:35.560 --> 01:00:39.160
you know, but I'm sure his estate got compensated for that. Exactly.

01:00:39.160 --> 01:00:45.240
That's what it's all about. So, you know, everything becoming more and more, you know,

01:00:45.800 --> 01:00:50.680
advanced, it's going to be interesting, especially with some of these, you know,

01:00:50.680 --> 01:00:54.520
folks that are going to pass on and they'll be back in movies again.

01:00:54.520 --> 01:00:58.840
Well, and I can I also completely understand from the voice actor and actress's perspective

01:00:58.840 --> 01:01:04.280
is that there may be language they don't want to say that then gets me like, for example,

01:01:04.280 --> 01:01:08.120
you know, we have what this is, eight hundred and seventy four episodes of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:01:08.120 --> 01:01:12.440
If somebody wanted to deconstruct our voices in one of these things, and I'm sure it's very easy

01:01:12.440 --> 01:01:19.080
to do, I would be very upset if my voice showed up saying things that I would not say. I would

01:01:19.080 --> 01:01:25.720
be very, very mad at that. So it's like it's really getting into murky territory.

01:01:25.720 --> 01:01:30.520
Yeah, absolutely. So like something something like you when you'd say like, you know,

01:01:30.520 --> 01:01:35.800
Krenner Trigger is the best video game out there is better than Metroid.

01:01:35.800 --> 01:01:38.600
I would absolutely sue. I would absolutely sue. And honestly,

01:01:39.160 --> 01:01:42.520
that's what it's going to come down to. And that's when they're going to be able to say,

01:01:42.520 --> 01:01:47.560
no, this is not parody. When one of these games has a voice actor say something that is against

01:01:47.560 --> 01:01:50.440
because, you know, actors have the right to say, no, they're not going to do a certain line of

01:01:50.440 --> 01:01:54.200
dialogue or they're not going to do a certain thing. I'm going to tell you, that's going to be

01:01:54.200 --> 01:01:57.800
when one of these voice actors, you know, or somebody that gets deep faked with one of these

01:01:57.800 --> 01:02:03.080
things is going to go through the roof and sue somebody out of the universe for using something

01:02:03.080 --> 01:02:06.760
and saying something they would never say. So that that's will be what it comes down to.

01:02:07.560 --> 01:02:13.160
Now, one, though, there are there are some positive uses for this, like text to speech

01:02:13.160 --> 01:02:19.400
synthesis. Sure. Which I think is going into party chat on Xbox. I think it is. I think it

01:02:19.400 --> 01:02:26.440
just went in there recently. It might be a testing beta thing, but yeah. And I think that for people

01:02:26.440 --> 01:02:32.920
who have trouble speaking, like imagine that you have a nonverbal autistic person, they could very

01:02:32.920 --> 01:02:40.440
well use speech synthesis to have a voice design their own virtual voice. I mean, imagine what

01:02:40.440 --> 01:02:46.120
would have happened if Stephen Hawking had this. Sure. But the voice would have had MC Hawking,

01:02:46.120 --> 01:02:51.400
but still the voices in those situations would probably be well aware they're donating

01:02:51.400 --> 01:02:56.760
themselves to medicine or getting compensated or whatever the case may be. So in those situations,

01:02:56.760 --> 01:03:03.480
like I'm sure there is, you know, some type of consent from the voice to actually to actually

01:03:03.480 --> 01:03:09.160
do that, like Siri's voice or any automated assistance voice. Right. They get they get

01:03:09.160 --> 01:03:16.520
compensated for that. So anyway. Let's see. Oh, that's interesting. Bobby Black Wolf says

01:03:16.520 --> 01:03:21.800
Stephen Hawking actually chose to keep the robotic voice even when they synthesized his real voice.

01:03:21.800 --> 01:03:27.560
I can understand why, though. Yeah. I mean, that was for all intents and purposes,

01:03:27.560 --> 01:03:33.160
his voice at that point. Right. So and again, all these things are, you know, if the voice

01:03:33.160 --> 01:03:38.040
actor agrees, if the person that is to use it agrees. And in that case, Stephen Hawking's

01:03:38.040 --> 01:03:45.240
didn't agree. So that was it. So anyway. All right. So, yeah, I think this I think this is

01:03:45.240 --> 01:03:50.040
one of the things that's kind of going to remain interesting while a modder uses it. But again,

01:03:50.040 --> 01:03:54.680
the first time somebody says something they would never say otherwise gets put out there.

01:03:55.960 --> 01:04:01.960
It's going to get ugly real quick. All right. Let's move on. Talk about our next story. Loki.

01:04:02.920 --> 01:04:10.440
Yeah, so this is fun, I guess. So we kind of knew that this was going to be happening sooner or

01:04:10.440 --> 01:04:18.920
later. But Facebook is testing VR ads in different games. So one of the first games to kind of test

01:04:18.920 --> 01:04:25.080
out this brand new type of in game advertising is a game called Blaston, which is on the Oculus

01:04:25.080 --> 01:04:32.360
Quest. And as such, there's been massive backlash against it. So finally, you know,

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:40.840
the devs behind it resolution games have decided to pull out of that testing program, basically

01:04:40.840 --> 01:04:44.520
saying after listening to player feedback, we realized blastin isn't the best fit for this

01:04:44.520 --> 01:04:50.520
type of advertising test. Therefore, we no longer plan to implement the test. But you know, people

01:04:50.600 --> 01:04:54.600
have been just saying, Listen, you know, I'm not going to buy your game, I'm going to refund it,

01:04:54.600 --> 01:05:01.720
I'm going to, you know, throw away my quest. I lots of crazy stuff, but it's coming. I mean,

01:05:01.720 --> 01:05:07.000
they're testing it. We knew that when Facebook was buying Oculus that this is what's going to happen

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:12.520
tracking and ads. So yeah. And I actually think it's unfortunate, I actually think this story

01:05:12.520 --> 01:05:17.400
has nothing to do with VR as much as I mean, it's just it just so happens this game is a VR game,

01:05:17.400 --> 01:05:22.760
as much as it has to do with Facebook getting into VR and what people's apprehensions were

01:05:22.760 --> 01:05:27.400
about that in the first place. Because remember, this isn't just about showing you ads in the game

01:05:27.400 --> 01:05:33.800
that you've already purchased. It's about showing you curated and targeted ads. And that's where

01:05:33.800 --> 01:05:39.560
that's where the real sinisterness of this comes out is that 10 by the way, it's not a free play

01:05:39.560 --> 01:05:44.600
game or anything like that. It's a game that you bought. And then they're sneaking not just not

01:05:44.600 --> 01:05:48.920
just any ad, because a lot of the stuff you play on like PlayStation, like let's say you bought

01:05:48.920 --> 01:05:53.960
because honestly, people are taking issue with this in other games to like Street Fighter five,

01:05:53.960 --> 01:05:58.120
you will sometimes load up a match and it's a match presented by you know, such as Oh,

01:05:58.120 --> 01:06:02.600
gosh, yeah, where they like skin everything. Yeah, I remember talking about that even when

01:06:02.600 --> 01:06:06.840
it was just like a Capcom fighting tournament or something, but like kind of where it's going to go.

01:06:06.840 --> 01:06:12.520
Now, let's just say now, resolution games hasn't necessarily backed out completely attesting these

01:06:12.520 --> 01:06:19.320
ads. So they've moved the test from the blast into bait, which is a free to play fishing game

01:06:19.320 --> 01:06:25.080
that they released back in 2019. So they're still doing the test. But I mean, it seems more

01:06:25.080 --> 01:06:31.080
appropriate in a free to play game. But still, though, it's like, I don't know. I mean, I know

01:06:31.080 --> 01:06:36.440
they're throwing money at these devs, obviously. So it's good money for them. But it's also I don't

01:06:36.520 --> 01:06:42.040
that's gross. It's Facebook. I just don't like it. You said that game is called Bait.

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:50.360
Bait. It's bait bait. So. So Facebook's want to know, do you like to bait?

01:06:52.440 --> 01:06:59.080
All right. Let's see other comments in chat. Fifth Dream says I block everything to master

01:06:59.080 --> 01:07:04.840
that game. But, you know, keep trying. Keep keep keep keep practicing a bait.

01:07:06.120 --> 01:07:12.840
One day you'll masturbate. Fifth Dream in chat says I block everything on Facebook except people

01:07:12.840 --> 01:07:18.040
or groups I follow. So I don't know what they think I like, but I'm obviously not interacting

01:07:18.040 --> 01:07:22.680
with ads. Zen Monkey in chat says they backed out. What they're probably going to do is make

01:07:22.680 --> 01:07:29.560
people buy loot in games. So, yeah. And this is I think even the people that we're trying to say,

01:07:29.560 --> 01:07:34.440
oh, well, maybe Facebook's getting into this, you know, to bring more real life things into VR and

01:07:34.440 --> 01:07:38.200
that we're giving Facebook the benefit of the doubt. Now that this is happening, it's like

01:07:39.480 --> 01:07:44.840
fucking Facebook sucks. Fuck them. So there's there's that as well. But the problem is, I think

01:07:44.840 --> 01:07:49.560
even if you like block things on Facebook, Facebook puts tracking things in other things

01:07:49.560 --> 01:07:54.120
around the Internet. So it still figures out a way to follow you. Yeah, because even if you

01:07:54.120 --> 01:07:58.440
don't have a Facebook account, they still have these like shell accounts that they

01:07:59.480 --> 01:08:06.040
come up with, you know, stuff based on your tracking stuff. So, yeah, it's I have a nice

01:08:06.040 --> 01:08:10.920
plug in that pretty much blocks most of that. A couple of others that I've been using. Well,

01:08:10.920 --> 01:08:15.880
I'm I'm really glad that other companies, too, are starting to step up and give the people what they

01:08:15.880 --> 01:08:22.680
want. And that's enhanced privacy, such as Apple's newest iOS that basically, you know, Facebook

01:08:22.680 --> 01:08:27.080
literally was kicking and screaming on the table over that privacy update because they knew

01:08:27.080 --> 01:08:31.400
it was going to, you know, really kick them. It's going to fuck them up. It's going to fuck up what

01:08:31.400 --> 01:08:39.240
their whole business is about. Good. Very good. And I hope more people kind of take, you know,

01:08:39.240 --> 01:08:42.520
following us. You know, so interesting. I saw a giant bill since I was driving home from the

01:08:42.520 --> 01:08:47.400
Bay today, I saw a giant billboard on the road home advertising, I think Duk Duk Goose,

01:08:47.400 --> 01:08:53.480
one of those companies. Yeah. That actually says, you know, go is that I'm sorry, go. Yeah,

01:08:53.480 --> 01:09:00.520
I called it Duk Duk Goose. Well, whatever. So I met you, man. Clearly, clearly the billboard

01:09:00.520 --> 01:09:08.840
worked on me. Can you get on the Internet's and find me Duk Duk Goose? Anyway, so whatever it is

01:09:08.840 --> 01:09:14.680
called Duk Duk Go, fine. There's a, they have an ad where it's like, do you want more privacy

01:09:14.680 --> 01:09:19.640
online? Or it's for people who value the privacy online. It's like, why don't you just say for

01:09:19.640 --> 01:09:23.560
people that want to give the middle finger to fucking Zuckerberg? Why don't they just say that

01:09:23.560 --> 01:09:30.600
on the billboard? Cause I'd buy, I'd probably remember the name if it had said that. Anyway.

01:09:30.600 --> 01:09:36.280
All right. Enough about why Facebook irritates me, but you know what? I got a lot of likes on

01:09:36.280 --> 01:09:41.880
the selfie I posted yesterday, so I guess these are the things I give up to have that attention.

01:09:41.880 --> 01:09:49.240
Well, and Duk Duk Go is one of the built-in preferences for search engines in Safari.

01:09:49.960 --> 01:09:56.200
Oh, I didn't know that. That's cool. Yeah, it is. All right. Let's move on and talk about Tekken

01:09:56.200 --> 01:10:00.280
Cross Street Fighter. Did you know that Tekken Cross Street Fighter is still a thing we're

01:10:00.280 --> 01:10:06.120
talking about in 2021? Because I bet like me, you pretty much figured this game was dead and

01:10:06.120 --> 01:10:11.880
they just never really announced it. And as it turns out, that was kind of the case. It's

01:10:11.880 --> 01:10:18.600
interesting. I realize this story has been updated, so please let me hear me out, folks.

01:10:18.600 --> 01:10:24.120
So originally what happened earlier this week is that there was a report that came out that

01:10:24.680 --> 01:10:30.280
Tekken development chief Katsuhiro Harada mentioned on his YouTube, Harada's Bar,

01:10:30.280 --> 01:10:35.560
that Tekken Cross Street Fighter was about 30% done when it was canceled, which we kind of all

01:10:35.560 --> 01:10:43.160
figured happened. Like the minute I saw Akuma show up in Tekken 7, I was like,

01:10:43.160 --> 01:10:47.880
that's all the Tekken Street Fighter you're going to get. That's what happened to Tekken

01:10:47.880 --> 01:10:53.160
Cross Street Fighter. That's it. There it is. Enjoy it. But yeah, apparently the game had

01:10:53.160 --> 01:10:58.600
been in development. It was about 30% done and then it was canceled according to this YouTube.

01:10:58.600 --> 01:11:05.160
But I'm sure some of you know, there was a follow-up where Katsuhiro Harada kind of clarified

01:11:05.160 --> 01:11:11.480
some of those comments saying that the English subtitles didn't properly translate what he was

01:11:11.480 --> 01:11:18.680
trying to say in Japanese. So he said that the game is in a pending state or on pause.

01:11:18.680 --> 01:11:24.280
So what he meant to say was up to 30% of the development was in progress, but now it is still

01:11:24.280 --> 01:11:29.320
pending. This is still the status of the project and we are still hopeful that Tekken Cross Street

01:11:29.320 --> 01:11:33.880
Fighter will resume development when the opportunity arises. However, such a title cannot

01:11:33.880 --> 01:11:38.040
be moved just for the convenience of one company in terms of marketing and branding. And it also

01:11:38.040 --> 01:11:42.440
affects each other's development resources. For now, we're just waiting for the right opportunity.

01:11:42.440 --> 01:11:47.800
Look, nothing but respect for Katsuhiro Harada and this project that he's working on in a game

01:11:47.800 --> 01:11:53.160
I would have really loved to see. But like when you put a project on pause like that for an

01:11:53.160 --> 01:11:59.000
indefinite period of time, when you don't know when it's restarting again, that's canceled.

01:11:59.560 --> 01:12:05.880
Or it becomes another game. The game was canceled. Yeah. So, you know, we're getting into a

01:12:05.880 --> 01:12:11.560
terminology war here, but it's not to say, and I think this is very important. It's not to say that

01:12:11.560 --> 01:12:20.760
a canceled game will never show up again. Metroid Dread is calling. Ring, ring. You just saw that

01:12:20.760 --> 01:12:25.320
a couple of weeks ago. That was a canceled game. I was going to say Star Fox 2. Oh, there you go.

01:12:25.320 --> 01:12:30.600
There's another one. Absolutely. So it's not that canceled games will never see the light of day.

01:12:31.560 --> 01:12:36.360
It's just it was. And how many of us had burned copies of Thrill Kill?

01:12:37.640 --> 01:12:45.160
That was pretty much finished. Oh boy. No one special 77 in chat says odds are we'll see

01:12:45.160 --> 01:12:50.360
Half-Life 3 before we see Tekken Cross Street Fighter. I have two answers for that. Number

01:12:50.360 --> 01:12:56.680
one, you already saw Half-Life 3. It's called Half-Life Alyx. Number two, I actually think

01:12:56.680 --> 01:13:02.280
you'll see Tekken Cross Street Fighter first, because I think it's interesting that this renewed

01:13:02.280 --> 01:13:06.760
interest in it could be interesting. I'm not saying it's going to make just because this

01:13:06.760 --> 01:13:12.280
happens is going to make it happen. But I do think there's kind of a renewed interest in it. And

01:13:13.160 --> 01:13:17.640
you never know. You never know. Like I said, nothing gets canceled forever. But I do think

01:13:17.640 --> 01:13:23.400
Half-Life 3 just isn't happening at this point or Half-Life exists in other stories such as Half-Life

01:13:23.400 --> 01:13:27.560
Alyx that they did not want to call Half-Life 3 because then people would have been blue in the

01:13:27.560 --> 01:13:34.760
face angry about Half-Life 3 as VR only. So anyway, compliment from a fifth dream in your

01:13:34.760 --> 01:13:40.200
chat on your nails saying nice color. Thank you for the podcast, folks. Dark Soccer showed off

01:13:40.200 --> 01:13:45.240
her nails on cam, which were I was kind of painting them because they were looking kind of

01:13:45.240 --> 01:13:51.080
gross. So is that like a metallic purple? I can't. It's hard for me. It's actually a holographic

01:13:51.080 --> 01:13:59.560
purple. OK, so it it'll it'll be all hollow when it's dried. OK, very cool. All right. Let's move

01:13:59.560 --> 01:14:05.160
on. I think we have Dark Soccer with another story. We do. And it's another Whopper. All

01:14:05.160 --> 01:14:12.600
right, everybody, time to whip out your brain. Well, not literally. Well, there are people who

01:14:13.560 --> 01:14:19.880
to to quote the the scarecrow, a lot of people without brains do an awful lot of talking.

01:14:19.880 --> 01:14:26.280
Was it was anyway, wasn't that the ending to Hannibal? Moving on. No, I don't remember. I

01:14:26.280 --> 01:14:31.000
didn't watch actually I didn't watch Hannibal. I just watched, you know, Silence of Lambs.

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:35.480
I did because I love Julianne more. And I remember just thinking the whole time what.

01:14:35.480 --> 01:14:45.640
Anyway, so there are different things that gaming can do to your brain.

01:14:48.200 --> 01:14:51.800
Now, they bring up World of Warcraft for a big one, for people who are addicted to their MMOs,

01:14:51.800 --> 01:15:01.960
right? But there's a reason people call it World of Warcrack, right? And now you remember when I

01:15:01.960 --> 01:15:06.840
was playing it, I was way into it. I did nothing but play well. I think we were kind of all in

01:15:06.840 --> 01:15:13.560
that at one point, right? Addict. Well, yeah, but we were kind of addicted to it, right?

01:15:13.560 --> 01:15:21.000
A little bit. Yeah, I think so. But it is. So I'm going to go through different things for

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:27.720
video games and we're going to start with addiction. So Mark, I think it's Palau,

01:15:28.280 --> 01:15:38.440
who has a PhD in cognitive neuroscience. He says that one aspect to understand how addictions work

01:15:38.440 --> 01:15:44.600
is the reward system of the brain. The reward system mediates how pleasant stimuli, such as

01:15:44.600 --> 01:15:49.560
the presence of food, water, social interaction, blah, blah, blah, acts as positive reinforcers

01:15:49.560 --> 01:15:54.600
for the behavior. So when we're exposed to that pleasurable thing, we want it more and more,

01:15:54.600 --> 01:16:05.000
like with a drug, right? And so there's now support groups for recovering from video game

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:16.440
addiction, or from being addicted to MMOs and stuff, right? So they are now going into

01:16:17.080 --> 01:16:26.440
the quick hits, more like the instant dopamine, right? So talking about things like Fortnite,

01:16:27.560 --> 01:16:37.400
where your games are quick like that, for us, even Dead by Daylight, what these do

01:16:37.400 --> 01:16:44.920
is it's going to give you just that quick release of dopamine. The neurotransmitter that goes,

01:16:44.920 --> 01:16:51.880
oh, happy, happy brain, happy. And then after, you know, your match and whichever game that

01:16:51.880 --> 01:16:56.920
you're playing, you know, the more dopamine that gets released, the better you feel and

01:16:56.920 --> 01:17:08.600
the greater your desire to play another. So. I have absolutely noticed the effect of Dead

01:17:08.600 --> 01:17:14.120
by Daylight specifically since you brought that up. Not so much on the brain part that you're

01:17:14.120 --> 01:17:18.760
talking about, but my heart rate, because, you know, when you wear one of these smartwatches,

01:17:18.760 --> 01:17:22.520
it's taking your heart rate all the time. And I absolutely notice when I'm playing survivor

01:17:22.520 --> 01:17:27.240
matches that are intense, I'm getting chased and, you know, and all that stuff. Like I look at my

01:17:27.240 --> 01:17:30.840
log and I can tell what points of the day I was playing Dead by Daylight because my heart rate

01:17:30.840 --> 01:17:34.360
literally goes up. It's fascinating. I should check what mine is, is killer.

01:17:34.360 --> 01:17:39.960
Yeah. Same thing happens to me is killer. I don't feel much the same way. I just get angry,

01:17:40.040 --> 01:17:45.400
insulting. You should add it to your streams, like add it as a thing. I used to do that with EDR.

01:17:46.840 --> 01:17:51.960
So with mine, like with my Fitbit, they have a Bluetooth thing. You're supposed to be able to

01:17:51.960 --> 01:17:56.840
sync it to your PC and be able to display that. And I do a screen capture, but that never worked.

01:17:56.840 --> 01:18:03.560
So I had to always screen. I had my phone with the app open and then I had a piece of software

01:18:03.560 --> 01:18:09.000
that screen captured the phone and put it into a window and I screen captured that and added

01:18:09.080 --> 01:18:13.160
to OBS. And so that actually worked for DDR, but I mean, that would probably work for Dead

01:18:13.160 --> 01:18:15.400
by Daylight too. Yeah. Interesting.

01:18:15.400 --> 01:18:23.720
Well, I know that there are ways of, I mean, you can, you can definitely have your,

01:18:24.840 --> 01:18:30.360
there's ways of streaming your iPhone, for example, and your watch syncs directly to your iPhone.

01:18:30.360 --> 01:18:35.880
So just saying, but anyway, going into a little bit more about that.

01:18:36.840 --> 01:18:42.360
There, there, this, this level of research that they're doing is still clearly in its infancy,

01:18:42.360 --> 01:18:49.320
like very early. And, you know, the biggest things that people are in power anywhere focusing on is

01:18:49.320 --> 01:18:55.640
that aspect of addiction. You know, they're always wanting to control what makes people happy,

01:18:56.360 --> 01:19:04.920
but, and also they do it under the guise of, is this good for people, for example. And I agree

01:19:05.720 --> 01:19:11.800
there are like legit places that are afraid of, of how it's going to affect the brain,

01:19:11.800 --> 01:19:17.800
but it can also be a really good tool for improving your cognitive skills.

01:19:17.800 --> 01:19:24.120
Now for when the research began in the nineties, the biggest thing that they were talking about

01:19:24.760 --> 01:19:30.680
was neuroplasticity, which is a process where the brain changes and adapts when exposed to new

01:19:30.680 --> 01:19:35.880
experiences. And the biggest thing, of course, they were talking about was hand-eye coordination.

01:19:36.440 --> 01:19:42.680
You know, for example, how if, you know, when they were using Doom and Team Fortress to,

01:19:43.800 --> 01:19:50.760
to do the test with, they published in 2016 of Scientific American, that individuals,

01:19:50.760 --> 01:19:53.800
I'm going to quote here, individuals who regularly play action games demonstrate

01:19:53.800 --> 01:19:58.760
improved ability to focus on visual details using useful for reading a fine print,

01:19:58.760 --> 01:20:02.840
illegal document or on a prescription bottle. They also display heightened sensitivity to

01:20:02.840 --> 01:20:07.880
visual contrast important when driving in thick fog, the multitasking required to switch back

01:20:07.880 --> 01:20:12.280
and forth between reading a menu and holding a conversation with the dinner partner also comes

01:20:12.280 --> 01:20:19.080
more easily. Video with this Wired article that I'm getting a lot from actually put some of that

01:20:19.080 --> 01:20:25.480
into action with a light board where people have to hit the lights as they pop up.

01:20:26.440 --> 01:20:30.920
And of course the pro gamer was better than the casual gamer.

01:20:34.120 --> 01:20:45.000
So there's also from a Ted talk called Your Brain on Video Games. They talk about how

01:20:48.200 --> 01:20:52.680
instead of, you know, what parents are saying that their kids are becoming a virtual zombie,

01:20:53.320 --> 01:21:01.080
it's, it's boosting their brain activity. There's also another study from UC Irvine that showed that

01:21:01.080 --> 01:21:05.960
3D games can improve functioning of the hippocampus, which is the part of the brain

01:21:05.960 --> 01:21:12.040
that is used in learning and memory. Researchers from Queen Mary University of London and University

01:21:12.040 --> 01:21:16.920
College London found that video games can aid mental agility and enhance strategic thinking,

01:21:17.880 --> 01:21:27.640
which also, you know, goes back to a UX designer and gamer named James Mitchell who stated that

01:21:27.640 --> 01:21:31.800
his critical thinking and strategy improved and he finds it easier to predict certain movements.

01:21:32.680 --> 01:21:37.000
I've even noticed just with me getting back into playing like Dead by Daylight

01:21:37.960 --> 01:21:47.960
that my reaction time in driving is better. Like I was on my breaks like really, really quickly

01:21:47.960 --> 01:21:54.760
when someone, not someone, but it was a dog ran out in front of me in the neighborhood. I mean,

01:21:54.760 --> 01:22:00.360
I was on it. I really felt that it was faster than how I might have been before. You know,

01:22:01.320 --> 01:22:07.160
despite having almost broken my hand, I've found that I'm quick to find things that are out of

01:22:07.160 --> 01:22:12.600
place. Like when my glasses fell off my bedside table, normally I'm fumbling around for a little

01:22:12.600 --> 01:22:16.680
bit, but I happened to catch just a pale glint of light off of them in the dark and I found my

01:22:16.680 --> 01:22:25.080
glasses. And I don't know, I want to say that my ability to notice things, and I already had a

01:22:25.080 --> 01:22:30.120
pretty decent ability to see things that a lot of people around me didn't see, but I think that's

01:22:30.200 --> 01:22:35.320
gotten even better. So maybe there was something to that whole hand-eye coordination argument we

01:22:35.320 --> 01:22:42.040
used to use with our parents on why video games were good. Exactly. And I'm on top. Yeah. Well,

01:22:42.040 --> 01:22:49.720
and the research is showing that you can become mentally more resilient, a faster thinker,

01:22:49.720 --> 01:22:59.080
and even smarter in general, in real life. Oh, there was another one in there that also was

01:22:59.080 --> 01:23:06.200
referring to the physical effects on the body as well. Like they had them play, do this thing

01:23:06.200 --> 01:23:10.520
where you have to keep tapping on a green dot no matter what the voice you're hearing through

01:23:10.520 --> 01:23:15.960
headphones is telling you. And that it actually builds up an anxiety response and the body reacts

01:23:15.960 --> 01:23:22.440
to that. Your heart's racing by the time you're done with it. And just, and you were like, you

01:23:22.440 --> 01:23:28.040
were saying with noticing your heart rate, you know, with your Apple watch. They're in these

01:23:28.040 --> 01:23:32.760
experiences that we're having that are building the brain. Our bodies are physically reacting to

01:23:32.760 --> 01:23:39.560
it. Now it's not going to be a replacement for taking a walk or lifting weights or doing some

01:23:39.560 --> 01:23:47.800
physical activity, but your body is still building from it as well as your brain. So keep that in

01:23:47.800 --> 01:23:52.440
mind. Um, I really liked this comment from Questbuster in our chat over twitch.tv slash

01:23:52.440 --> 01:23:57.720
vog network, who says one story I like to go back to on games benefiting mental health is from a

01:23:57.720 --> 01:24:02.680
story I dug up from the eighties when a psychologist related their experience on using wizardry

01:24:02.680 --> 01:24:06.920
to help troubled children break out of their shells when they talked about the characters

01:24:06.920 --> 01:24:13.960
they made, uh, clarifying wizard, the CRPG, not actual wizardry. Yo wizard Questbuster.

01:24:15.480 --> 01:24:20.360
I don't know, but I'm oddly thinking of the episode of supernatural where the kid doesn't

01:24:20.360 --> 01:24:27.000
want to talk to Sam or Dean. And so, uh, Garth brings out his sock puppet. Um, and the kid will

01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:32.520
talk to the sock puppet. Hey, since you brought it up before we go to our next story, cause I

01:24:32.520 --> 01:24:36.280
know somebody is going to ask cause I've seen it on our vog network discord. I'm not sure how often

01:24:36.280 --> 01:24:40.920
you're you're in there, but somebody had tagged you in a, um, there's a supernatural prequel in

01:24:40.920 --> 01:24:48.600
the works. Your thoughts quickly. All right. So I'm going to put it this way. I would probably

01:24:48.600 --> 01:24:56.200
check it out. Okay. Yeah. But there are all these people up in arms over their dad being super

01:24:56.200 --> 01:25:01.480
abusive because he was taking out his trauma and pain and ignoring his kids and treating them like

01:25:01.480 --> 01:25:09.480
something. I'm not going to get into that argument. I, I could say a lot about inherited trauma,

01:25:10.920 --> 01:25:16.840
but, um, and tiger call, don't even bother telling me anything about the supernatural

01:25:16.840 --> 01:25:24.040
thing and how the actors reacted because I saw it. Um, I know that, uh, Jared posted his,

01:25:24.040 --> 01:25:31.560
he played Sam posted his surprise and dismay at not having been told about it because the

01:25:31.560 --> 01:25:35.960
production company behind this is owned by Jensen Ackles and his wife, Danielle. Um,

01:25:37.320 --> 01:25:41.640
they're the ones that are behind this, but you know, apparently they talked about things are

01:25:41.640 --> 01:25:45.560
cool again and people are going to react to the way they're going to react. I mean, I,

01:25:45.560 --> 01:25:49.560
it wouldn't be the first time somebody has blown up about something on the internet that they were

01:25:49.560 --> 01:25:53.080
kind of pissed about and then kind of regretted it later. You know, this happens all the time

01:25:53.080 --> 01:25:57.400
with movie remakes too. Like the original stars aren't consulted about the movie remakes. They

01:25:57.400 --> 01:26:01.240
just find out in the papers like everyone else does, Oh, they're remaking this movie. I was

01:26:01.240 --> 01:26:07.880
started in the eighties. Same, same thing. Well, and that's the, that's the thing about it,

01:26:07.880 --> 01:26:18.920
you know, and I, there are groups in Twitter that I am, I'd say peripherally part of, but I am the

01:26:18.920 --> 01:26:26.600
person that waits for fact. I try not to have an immediate emotional reaction to it. And I don't

01:26:27.240 --> 01:26:38.600
look into it as a point as an excuse to attack somebody. There's no point in attacking somebody,

01:26:38.600 --> 01:26:45.320
attacking a fucking character, attacking the actors, dragging people through the mud

01:26:45.320 --> 01:26:52.680
over fiction. Don't say anything about it until it's out until you have something to actually

01:26:52.680 --> 01:26:57.800
talk about. Okay. All right. Let's move on to our next story. Got to get it back to gaming.

01:26:57.800 --> 01:27:02.440
I had to do the quick aside though, cause we all know you, you love Supernatural. And when I saw

01:27:02.440 --> 01:27:07.960
that, uh, story this week, I was like, Ooh, I wonder what the opinion is. So, all right. Uh,

01:27:07.960 --> 01:27:15.640
Loki. So, uh, it looks like that we're going to be getting an update to the X cloud, um,

01:27:16.360 --> 01:27:23.320
game streaming. So before they were streaming that the quality of like, say an Xbox, uh, one level

01:27:23.320 --> 01:27:29.720
of performance, but now it's actually going to be upgraded to Xbox series X quality. Um,

01:27:29.720 --> 01:27:35.000
that's going to be going to Android and PC devices right now. Uh, they're still testing

01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:40.280
the Xbox consoles, but that's nice to see that bump in quality though. Um,

01:27:40.280 --> 01:27:43.800
especially with games like, you know, for the horizon five or in around the corner,

01:27:44.520 --> 01:27:51.000
that should be pretty exciting. So, uh, yeah, looking forward to checking that out. I haven't

01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:56.120
actually used the streaming, um, yet just because I have all of my stuff natively on my concert,

01:27:56.120 --> 01:28:03.160
my PC, but sounds cool. I literally thought the cloud was already working this way is that was

01:28:03.160 --> 01:28:07.480
the most surprising to me. I mean, I haven't been special enough to get a beta into this or

01:28:07.480 --> 01:28:11.400
whatever. So I've been able to check it out myself, but I was kind of surprised it wasn't

01:28:11.400 --> 01:28:16.840
already running on the series X quality. Why the hell wouldn't it? I like, it's just, it's, it's,

01:28:16.840 --> 01:28:20.680
it's a little, I'm sorry. I mean, I don't, it's just a little shocking to me. It took them nine

01:28:20.680 --> 01:28:26.440
months after the release of the console for, you know, the general public to put it on the cloud,

01:28:26.440 --> 01:28:32.120
like way to demonstrate that the cloud is going to lag behind. I just, I think hopefully this is

01:28:32.120 --> 01:28:36.920
the last sort of thing like this by Microsoft, because I sort of feel like if they want the

01:28:36.920 --> 01:28:43.720
cloud to be competitive, the cloud has to be cutting edge and not lagging behind. It's just

01:28:43.720 --> 01:28:50.360
weird to me. I don't understand why they did that approach. I don't know either testing, blah, blah,

01:28:50.360 --> 01:28:54.360
blah, whatever. Maybe it could, it's just a little, little weird to me, but all right.

01:28:55.240 --> 01:29:00.360
So, uh, you know, cause inevitably micro inevitably Microsoft will put out another

01:29:00.360 --> 01:29:04.840
console, the series Y or a different, you know, a different family altogether.

01:29:04.840 --> 01:29:09.720
Although they'll think of another dumb name for it, but yeah, it'll be something like that.

01:29:09.720 --> 01:29:14.120
Whatever it is. If they really want to make impress people with it,

01:29:14.120 --> 01:29:18.920
they really should put it on the cloud sooner so people can get a taste of it, honestly. But I,

01:29:20.120 --> 01:29:26.440
that's just my opinion, I guess. So yeah. All right. Uh, moving on, let's talk about

01:29:26.440 --> 01:29:33.800
the next Yakuza game. Uh, let's talk about that because, uh, I believe we know that there is a,

01:29:33.800 --> 01:29:39.160
where there's different, um, series, you know, the Yakuza has got, uh, the, um, judgment kind

01:29:39.160 --> 01:29:42.920
of spinoff that's going on now, because I believe the mainline games are going to follow a little

01:29:42.920 --> 01:29:47.640
more in the tradition of like a dragon. Whereas the judgment games will go a little more in the,

01:29:47.640 --> 01:29:54.520
um, the, the, the more traditional, uh, step. Um, so, uh, in the Yakuza series,

01:29:54.520 --> 01:30:00.920
they've usually had playable versions of classic Sega games, and usually these are arcade classics.

01:30:00.920 --> 01:30:07.960
However, lost judgment is going to be going a little different direction. Um, and, uh,

01:30:07.960 --> 01:30:14.120
they're going to have a vintage master system to replace the pinball machine from the first game.

01:30:14.120 --> 01:30:20.120
And I guess the master system actually, yeah. So, uh, the first menu you see, uh, it's an option

01:30:20.120 --> 01:30:25.400
screen where you can like read the manual, change the region of the game. You can pause the game,

01:30:25.400 --> 01:30:29.800
um, which I guess on the, and I didn't realize this on the original console, the pause was on

01:30:29.800 --> 01:30:34.440
the console, not the controller. Um, but I guess, you know, thinking about old design,

01:30:34.440 --> 01:30:41.320
it probably was that way. Uh, and then you see in the video Penguinland or Doki Doki Penguinland,

01:30:41.320 --> 01:30:47.560
uh, before, uh, Takuya Kimura, uh, settles in to play Alex Kidd. So I think that's kind of

01:30:47.560 --> 01:30:55.400
interesting. So, um, yeah, so, uh, lost judgment, of course, the sequel to 2019 judgment, uh,

01:30:55.400 --> 01:31:01.560
and it's due out in September. So, you know, you can buy this new fancy Akusa game and play old

01:31:01.560 --> 01:31:07.960
games in it to some extent. So weird that like a company would put their old catalog of games in

01:31:07.960 --> 01:31:15.160
there without trying to sell it separately for more money. I mean, if only other larger companies

01:31:15.160 --> 01:31:20.520
would take note of that and like, I don't know, offered in their game with animals and

01:31:20.520 --> 01:31:27.800
town building, maybe that might be a good idea to do that and not be super greedy and just complete

01:31:27.800 --> 01:31:31.880
dicks about it. I don't know. Well, Loki, I think the video game companies to that would say,

01:31:35.160 --> 01:31:36.360
everything's about the bottom line.

01:31:39.080 --> 01:31:42.920
I know, but what, what made us all check? I mean, at least for me, I guess I can't speak

01:31:42.920 --> 01:31:47.000
for everyone, but what made me interested in animal crossing in the first play in the

01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:50.760
very first place? Why did I give it, give a hoot about animal crossing on the game cube?

01:31:50.760 --> 01:31:54.920
It was that little, little sticker right on the front that said comes with two classic NES games

01:31:54.920 --> 01:32:00.120
and you can unlock many more that sold that game to me. And it's not necessarily that people are

01:32:00.120 --> 01:32:04.600
going to like, I don't know why they're taking it as like, people are going to just not buy

01:32:04.600 --> 01:32:11.080
the game now because they have it available in like another game to play. Like that's not the

01:32:11.080 --> 01:32:14.840
case. Like, I don't think like, for example, with Yakuza, like a dragon, you know, I'm not

01:32:15.480 --> 01:32:20.040
gonna, well, I'm not interested in virtual fighter. But like, if I was, I'm not gonna not

01:32:20.040 --> 01:32:25.720
purchase like virtual fighter five. If you know, just because I can play it in a game,

01:32:25.720 --> 01:32:30.520
it's inconvenient to do that just kind of a neat thing to be able to do that Sega is still selling

01:32:30.520 --> 01:32:37.640
these games separately and collections that are available out there that you can purchase. I just

01:32:37.880 --> 01:32:42.600
don't be greedy. Just come on. Like, I don't get it why they're doing this.

01:32:42.600 --> 01:32:48.040
And Bobby, of course, and Chad is asking, have you played like a dragon yet? And sadly,

01:32:48.040 --> 01:32:51.880
the answer is no. But that's because I'm kind of stretched on bandwidth right now. I can't,

01:32:52.520 --> 01:32:58.200
I can't download any new games right now. We're like almost out of bandwidth. So either I just

01:32:58.200 --> 01:33:04.440
have to suck it up and pay extra money or I'm going to try again next month. So that's a whole

01:33:04.520 --> 01:33:10.440
other issue. Why? Why? We don't have, you know, two terabyte caps yet, but whatever.

01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:17.000
Anyway, let's move on. Oh, I think this is an appropriate time after that story to get

01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:23.560
into this segment.

01:33:32.520 --> 01:33:38.520
Time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and

01:33:38.520 --> 01:33:44.360
tell you about it. It's time for the classic game of the week. What is that classic game of the week?

01:33:44.360 --> 01:33:54.280
Lemmings. Yes, I picked lemmings. I haven't done lemmings. I was surprised I haven't done lemmings

01:33:54.280 --> 01:33:59.480
and it's been on fucking everything. I was really surprised. I swore we talked about

01:33:59.480 --> 01:34:02.920
this game, but I guess we just talked about it. It wasn't highlighted. Yeah,

01:34:02.920 --> 01:34:08.520
it's certainly not. And it's a game based off of something completely fabricated too.

01:34:09.480 --> 01:34:20.440
So, because there was a study that was fabricated that said that lemmings will

01:34:20.440 --> 01:34:27.400
follow each other off a cliff and into death and everything. And it was done in like,

01:34:29.240 --> 01:34:33.640
oh gosh, what was it? Yeah, it was that they were driven to mass suicide when they,

01:34:33.800 --> 01:34:41.080
uh, when they, uh, you know, go, it was, it was stupid. Anyway, so basically in Lemmings,

01:34:41.080 --> 01:34:47.400
it's a puzzle. It's a puzzle game. It was originally developed by DMA design in Dundee,

01:34:47.400 --> 01:34:56.040
Scotland and published by Psygnosis for the Amiga in 1991. So we have a 30 year old game.

01:34:56.040 --> 01:35:07.720
Um, it was also ported for many, many, many, many, many other platforms. So it was also inspired

01:35:07.720 --> 01:35:17.640
by an animation that was done with deluxe paint. So anyway, um, the objective of the game is to

01:35:17.640 --> 01:35:22.280
take these anthropomorphized lemmings that look nothing like a lemming by the way, cause lemmings

01:35:22.280 --> 01:35:31.000
are fucking adorable, um, do different obstacles to an exit. Um, you have to save a certain amount

01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:35.720
of the lemmings to win. And if you want to think of like a more modern take on it, think of like

01:35:35.720 --> 01:35:44.680
choo choo rocket. Uh, anyway, um, you, uh, assign different lemmings, one of eight different skills

01:35:44.680 --> 01:35:51.480
that allow them to react with the landscape. So, um, it also affects the behavior of the

01:35:51.480 --> 01:36:00.280
other lemmings that can make, uh, safe passages for them and all kinds of things. Um, it was the

01:36:00.280 --> 01:36:08.120
second highest rated game for Strad. Um, and it was the eighth greatest game of all time by

01:36:08.120 --> 01:36:13.960
next generation magazine as of 1996. And one of, again, one of the most widely ported and best

01:36:13.960 --> 01:36:19.880
selling video games, um, for all of its various ports that sold over 200 million copies. Um,

01:36:19.880 --> 01:36:27.800
there's sequels, remakes, spinoffs, inspired games, all kinds of stuff. Um, and it's, it's been

01:36:27.800 --> 01:36:38.520
up there. Um, so at any rate, um, the original, um, the original game, uh, you had, uh, different

01:36:38.520 --> 01:36:44.840
levels that had four difficulty categories and each level has a trap door opening from above that

01:36:44.840 --> 01:36:50.440
releases a stream of lemmings to follow each other. And so, like I said before, you just have

01:36:50.440 --> 01:36:57.080
to get them from point A to point B lemmings can die by falling from a great height, falling into

01:36:57.080 --> 01:37:03.960
water or lava and disappearing off the bottom of the map, being caught in a trap or fire, um, or

01:37:03.960 --> 01:37:11.320
being assigned to the bomber skill. Um, and, uh, every level of course has a time limit. If it's

01:37:11.320 --> 01:37:20.360
down to zero, then it ends. So, uh, your levels of difficulty are, um, fun, tricky, taxing,

01:37:20.360 --> 01:37:27.880
and mayhem. So I think that's pretty funny. There's also a, uh, two player mode, 22 player levels,

01:37:28.680 --> 01:37:35.640
um, that actually took advantage of the Amiga's ability to support two simultaneous mice.

01:37:36.440 --> 01:37:41.560
And then of course with the, uh, later on with the Atari's ability to, uh, play with a mouse

01:37:41.560 --> 01:37:48.520
and joystick simultaneously. So, uh, you can, you know, do your own lemmings, you have their own

01:37:48.520 --> 01:37:55.720
base, um, and you have to get more of more lemmings regardless of color into one's own base

01:37:55.720 --> 01:38:03.000
than the other player. So you can actually lemming snipe. So, um, as for the development of the game,

01:38:03.400 --> 01:38:13.880
it was, uh, uh, meant to just be a, just a fun little thing, but it was inspired by that one

01:38:13.880 --> 01:38:20.040
little, uh, eight by eight pixel box. It was you using deluxe paint and it's just of a little

01:38:20.760 --> 01:38:30.520
dude with blue hair walking. Um, and so, uh, it was actually as part of a development for

01:38:31.160 --> 01:38:34.600
a game called Walker, which was supposed to be a sequel to a game called blood money.

01:38:35.240 --> 01:38:45.320
Um, but as they went through, you know, they, uh, ended up just going with games with, with

01:38:45.320 --> 01:38:50.680
their game and they kept going and there we go. We have a lemmings. I'm not going to go like way

01:38:50.680 --> 01:38:56.920
into the history. If you want to know more about it, there's a, uh, a documentary, um, called the

01:38:56.920 --> 01:39:05.400
lemming story and from 2006, you can all watch. Um, so going, going back then, so going into the

01:39:05.400 --> 01:39:14.920
various, various assistance, um, there were released for Atari ST Sinclair spectrum, uh,

01:39:14.920 --> 01:39:26.360
the ZX spectrum PC SNES. Um, after the game was ported to 20 systems, um, David Jones, who was,

01:39:26.360 --> 01:39:33.960
uh, in part behind this, uh, basically steady, stop counting. Um, for other ones, other commercial

01:39:33.960 --> 01:39:39.480
ports, we've had the 3dio, the acorn, the Archimedes, the, uh, apple two GS, uh, the

01:39:39.480 --> 01:39:45.880
Macintosh and as in the old Macintosh, the CDTV, Commodore 64 NES master system, Genesis,

01:39:45.880 --> 01:39:52.760
turbo graphics, 16 Phillips CDI and sharp X 68,000. Um, and then there was an open source cross

01:39:52.760 --> 01:40:01.560
platform clone in 1998 called pingas P I N G U S. Um, psychosis has continuously owned

01:40:01.560 --> 01:40:06.200
the license for lemming. And then of course now Sony owns it, but, um,

01:40:08.920 --> 01:40:14.600
uh, but when of course, uh, signosis closed that made it fully owned by Sony. And so they've done

01:40:14.600 --> 01:40:21.160
more modern remakes. We have lemmings for PSP done by team 17 has the original levels and a

01:40:21.160 --> 01:40:30.520
bunch of others and data pack support. Um, there were, uh, you can make your own user levels

01:40:30.520 --> 01:40:38.920
through a lemmings online community. There was, uh, uh, another one, uh, for PS2 that used the

01:40:38.920 --> 01:40:46.280
eye toy. Um, how did they would mention the eye toy again? Huh? Uh, team 17 also did one for PS3

01:40:46.280 --> 01:40:52.680
through the PlayStation network. Um, very similar to the PSP title. Um, but of course it doesn't

01:40:52.680 --> 01:41:00.520
have the ability to, uh, create and share levels. And then there's lemmings touch for PS Vita. Um,

01:41:01.080 --> 01:41:11.720
that was done, uh, by, uh, it says by, uh, D3 T limited and then a sad puppy from Sony did a mobile

01:41:11.720 --> 01:41:17.960
friendly version of lemmings for iOS and Android in 20 teen. There were a bunch of expansions for

01:41:17.960 --> 01:41:24.680
the original called. Oh no, more lemmings was one of them. It was Christmas lemmings. Um, of course

01:41:24.680 --> 01:41:36.280
the Christmas lemmings. Yeah. Yeah. Um, there, uh, in fact, uh, where I'm reading everything from

01:41:36.280 --> 01:41:42.040
has a picture of the floppy, the three, the three and a half or three and a quarter. Sorry. Um,

01:41:43.240 --> 01:41:54.840
there, uh, I mean, they're just basically so many, many, many, many. So we'll, we'll go into some of

01:41:54.840 --> 01:42:02.200
the, the post original. So lemmings to the tribes, uh, all new world, all new world of lemmings,

01:42:02.200 --> 01:42:09.880
um, 3d lemmings lemmings revolution. Um, there was also lemmings paintball in 1996 and the

01:42:09.880 --> 01:42:17.960
adventures of Lomax. There were the clones, like the humans, um, pingas was when I mentioned

01:42:17.960 --> 01:42:26.040
earlier, there is a game called, uh, mouse craft that borrows from lemmings and Tetris.

01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:39.960
Um, and then, uh, there we go. So we've also had, uh, I mean, just lots of people reference it. I

01:42:39.960 --> 01:42:48.920
mean, in, uh, uh, the first Warcraft game, they, uh, were inspired in part by the lemmings versus

01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:56.200
mode, um, including also with, uh, the lost Vikings. Um, and then, uh, Terry Pratchett,

01:42:56.200 --> 01:43:03.000
you know, um, one of the great authors, um, in his novel, interesting times, uh,

01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:09.960
he had an army of golems that was used the way that the lemmings were used the same interface.

01:43:10.920 --> 01:43:18.840
Um, and then he said, uh, merely because the red army can fight, dig, March and climb,

01:43:18.840 --> 01:43:23.320
and is controlled by little icons. Can't imagine how anyone thought that not only did I wipe

01:43:23.320 --> 01:43:30.440
lemmings from my hard disk, I override it. So I couldn't get it back. And there you go. Oh, also

01:43:30.440 --> 01:43:38.040
the Royal mail had, uh, lemmings, uh, stamps in 2020 to pay tribute to the UK's, uh, video

01:43:38.040 --> 01:43:44.120
game industry. And on that note lemmings. All right. There it is a true classic, uh,

01:43:44.120 --> 01:43:50.680
one notable on stamps overseas, uh, lemmings. I, you know, I gotta admit, like I, I knew this

01:43:50.680 --> 01:43:56.280
series, um, you know, it kind of faded away. I didn't realize how recent they were still making

01:43:56.280 --> 01:44:00.200
these games. When you brought up like the Vita, I was like, I don't remember that having a Vita

01:44:00.200 --> 01:44:05.560
game, but, um, I do remember this game was absolutely huge when it first came out. I

01:44:05.640 --> 01:44:10.200
remember playing it. I remember downloading that Christmas lemmings. Uh, I think there was a,

01:44:10.200 --> 01:44:14.520
a multi-stage demo or something that was on a BBS. And I remember, cause I don't think it

01:44:14.520 --> 01:44:18.600
was the whole game, but I remember downloading like a Christmas lemmings thing from a gamer,

01:44:18.600 --> 01:44:23.080
like I think had it, uh, maybe, I don't know, but like, you know, something like that. Yeah.

01:44:23.080 --> 01:44:30.200
This game was, it was called holiday lemmings. Oh, maybe. Oh yeah. Well that would make sense too.

01:44:30.200 --> 01:44:33.960
But, um, yeah. So it's just, it's just one of those things. It's like, yeah, it was a really

01:44:33.960 --> 01:44:38.600
Epic part of like nineties gaming history, especially on a computer, even though they

01:44:38.600 --> 01:44:43.320
put it out on every console out there as you kind of got into, uh, I kind of always considered it

01:44:43.320 --> 01:44:47.160
a PC game. I think it was a super Nintendo game because it supported this. I think it was one of

01:44:47.160 --> 01:44:51.880
the few games that supported that SNES mouse. Like you didn't need it, but I think it supported it

01:44:51.880 --> 01:44:57.400
and it was certainly much better for having it. So, um, yeah. Orange right in chats has probably

01:44:57.400 --> 01:45:01.480
played this on one of those shareware filled CDs back in the day. I'm positive that's where

01:45:01.480 --> 01:45:06.040
Christmas lemmings was hiding out, man. But, um, yeah, what a throwback, what a, what a great,

01:45:06.040 --> 01:45:11.560
great, um, game from history. Have any of y'all ever seen what an actual lemming looks like?

01:45:12.280 --> 01:45:15.480
Oh, it's not, they're not blue with green hair. That's for sure. They're

01:45:15.480 --> 01:45:23.640
no, they're these adorable, cute little tiny rodents. They're so freaking cute.

01:45:24.360 --> 01:45:29.720
Like I can't get over it. So I have a very fun and embarrassing story that taught that

01:45:30.360 --> 01:45:38.760
directly ties into what this game can't wait. Do it. So back in the early nineties,

01:45:38.760 --> 01:45:45.080
for some reason, I was, uh, I had actually a fan site for lemmings and actually,

01:45:45.880 --> 01:45:49.640
so I, well, it wasn't necessarily for the game. So like, here's the, here's,

01:45:49.640 --> 01:45:55.800
here's the thing. Like I found that I could draw them kind of pretty easy. You know,

01:45:55.800 --> 01:45:59.960
it's a pretty difficult, it's not difficult. So I was drawing a bunch of them. And so I

01:45:59.960 --> 01:46:05.800
actually had a fan site with like my, uh, artwork that I put out there that was on like

01:46:05.800 --> 01:46:11.000
geo cities or something like way back in the day. But yeah, the lemmings continent was,

01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:15.880
I think you can probably still find it actually on the way back machine and stuff like that.

01:46:15.880 --> 01:46:22.280
But yeah, that was a long time ago. I did that and actually embarrassingly enough. Um,

01:46:22.280 --> 01:46:29.080
there was an, like a film festival or something like that, that Sega had went through. And I

01:46:29.080 --> 01:46:34.680
remember talking to them or like somebody that worked for Sega about like pitching a game idea

01:46:34.680 --> 01:46:39.960
or something like a sequel to all that stuff, even though they have no rights to it at all.

01:46:39.960 --> 01:46:42.200
And I don't know why I thought that would work out, but like,

01:46:43.960 --> 01:46:48.120
I don't know, I was obsessed for awhile, but I have artwork that at the time I thought was

01:46:48.120 --> 01:46:53.240
pretty good. It's all right. I still have it saved, you know, um, uh, printed out. I don't

01:46:53.240 --> 01:46:58.840
know if I have the files anymore, but, um, yeah, that was kind of like my early high school was

01:46:58.840 --> 01:47:04.600
that kind of stuff. I love that. I had a websites in college dedicated to female musicians. There

01:47:04.600 --> 01:47:10.520
was like four different ones and one of them was on MTV and yeah, let's try and find it. I know

01:47:10.520 --> 01:47:16.680
that I think it's out there actually, because it was called the lemmings continent. So that's what

01:47:16.680 --> 01:47:21.720
it was called. It was not a web, it wasn't like a.com or anything like that. It was, uh, I don't

01:47:21.720 --> 01:47:26.520
remember what the URL was, but that that's what it was called, but you can probably find it on

01:47:26.520 --> 01:47:32.760
the way back machine. Um, I don't remember if it was like a Yahoo site or something like that,

01:47:32.760 --> 01:47:37.160
but I know I found it at one time cause I got copies of the artwork. I think it's still out

01:47:37.160 --> 01:47:44.920
there, but yeah, I had my own embarrassing websites too. So I had one about Julia Chang

01:47:44.920 --> 01:47:51.800
and Tekken three. Oh, that's true. And I had one and I had one, uh, this was that, well,

01:47:51.800 --> 01:47:59.880
that one was geo cities and then I had one through AOL. That was, um, my absolute shipping of, uh,

01:47:59.880 --> 01:48:06.440
Ryoga and Ukyo from Ronwell. I love that. I mean, it's, yeah, the, the, the old websites

01:48:06.440 --> 01:48:10.760
are embarrassing, but at the same time for me, it's like, well, you know, those, uh,

01:48:10.760 --> 01:48:14.600
those musicians really impacted me during a very difficult time in my life. So I'm,

01:48:14.600 --> 01:48:19.160
I'm not actually embarrassed by it, but it is just a little silly. You know, it's, it's silly.

01:48:19.160 --> 01:48:24.280
I think it's a good way for me, for me. Um, yeah. Dark soccer and chat says geo shitties.

01:48:25.160 --> 01:48:32.040
I think I, so I do. Okay. So I did find a link that someone had posted like in an old tripod

01:48:32.040 --> 01:48:38.200
site because they had linked to it. Um, but I, so I have the old URL, so you have to go in the way

01:48:38.200 --> 01:48:43.240
back machine, but I'll post it in chat. All right. I love that. Our old Rocky horror site,

01:48:43.240 --> 01:48:48.280
uh, was on a geo cities, our old cast website. It's great. Yeah. It was an old geo city site,

01:48:48.280 --> 01:48:52.520
but that, yeah, there it is. And then, um, I think on the way back machine, you can see some

01:48:52.520 --> 01:48:57.960
of the artwork, which now is all right. I thought I did. All right. I was excited about it. All

01:48:57.960 --> 01:49:05.720
right. Let's move on. It's very matrixy, which is really, it doesn't really early nineties. What

01:49:06.440 --> 01:49:13.480
you, all right. Actually it wasn't the movie 99. So there'll be late nineties. Oh, it was,

01:49:13.480 --> 01:49:16.280
I think, I don't remember, but yeah, it was, it's very much like that.

01:49:17.560 --> 01:49:21.560
I'm most positive. The matrix came out in 99. Cause I saw it with friends in college.

01:49:21.560 --> 01:49:28.200
I wasn't in high school. I don't remember. I have to find out now. 1999. Yep. That's what

01:49:28.200 --> 01:49:32.040
I thought. Yeah. The original matrix was 1999. Maybe you were just ahead of your time.

01:49:32.040 --> 01:49:37.880
Logie. I think I saw it right before, you know, right after I moved out here.

01:49:40.280 --> 01:49:44.600
All right. Anyhow, let's move up. Orange. Right. It says, yep. It's on the way back machine and

01:49:44.600 --> 01:49:48.600
here's the receipts. Oh, I can't wait to look at this. Oh yes. And then I got my,

01:49:48.600 --> 01:49:56.120
yeah, there's my artwork. It's here. This background. Well, Hey, that, that was,

01:49:56.120 --> 01:50:03.480
that was the, the, uh, yeah. Uh, orange. Right. And Chad says it even has a section for encounters

01:50:03.480 --> 01:50:09.560
with stupid people. The original FUs of the week. Yes. I remember that now. Oh gosh. Yeah. People

01:50:09.560 --> 01:50:15.080
found my old personal websites and no, I'm not even giving you an EMS, but found my personal

01:50:15.080 --> 01:50:20.120
website. So like my angsty poetry and shit, I'd probably die, but is when I had data files,

01:50:20.120 --> 01:50:25.320
like this is where I actually had a edit data and stuff like that. And, or I did at one point.

01:50:25.320 --> 01:50:31.640
Oh, they're cute. Yeah. So that was, that was, that was fun times when that was my kind of

01:50:31.640 --> 01:50:37.480
getting used to working. I think I was back with corral draw, like, or yeah, it's corral draw.

01:50:37.480 --> 01:50:41.000
It was what we had in our art class. So that was kind of just stuff I was just messing around with

01:50:41.000 --> 01:50:45.560
and everything. But yeah, I had a character named suicide, Bob, which is completely inappropriate.

01:50:45.560 --> 01:50:50.600
He has Pikachu's face on it. Uh, but he was a stick of dynamite that would keep resurrecting

01:50:50.600 --> 01:50:55.960
himself kind of like, uh, predating, um, Kenny from South park, but that was, that was that

01:50:55.960 --> 01:51:01.240
character. But yeah, it was fun times. Glad you got the, got the witness of my artwork.

01:51:02.280 --> 01:51:05.400
And now we're going to be digging through this website. All right. All night. All right. We've

01:51:05.400 --> 01:51:11.400
always reading your first stupid person story. Oh gosh. I don't even know. There's so many.

01:51:12.040 --> 01:51:16.520
We need to break things up and, uh, travel ag, you bring up DDR on here though. So this was

01:51:16.520 --> 01:51:20.520
still going when you first like this. Oh, wow. I made this when I was 20. I thought it was so

01:51:20.520 --> 01:51:25.880
much younger. You probably ended this right before OLR started. So that's kind of a fun relic. All

01:51:25.880 --> 01:51:30.040
right. Uh, anyway, let's move on. We got to keep moving with the show, get some rapid fire news.

01:51:30.040 --> 01:51:35.560
So Loki, if you want to change the topic, here's your chance. Yeah. So let's talk about space jam.

01:51:36.120 --> 01:51:43.720
Uh, so the space jam is getting a video game, or at least a SQL is. So they actually had a contest,

01:51:44.360 --> 01:51:48.920
that kind of posed the question of what do you think a space jam video game would look like? So

01:51:48.920 --> 01:51:53.480
they'd had fans submitting artwork and stuff. And so they based on that, the developers at

01:51:53.480 --> 01:51:59.640
digital clips decided to go ahead and create a game that kind of looks like an old arcade beat

01:51:59.640 --> 01:52:07.800
them up. So they have that. And that'll be coming out pretty soon on a game pass ultimate and all

01:52:07.800 --> 01:52:13.160
the other platforms looks like July 1st. So space jam, a new legacy for that. And then tie in with

01:52:13.160 --> 01:52:19.000
the Xbox portion of that they're actually going to be doing a goon squad tune squad and some other

01:52:19.640 --> 01:52:25.400
random I don't know what it's supposed to be controllers that you can actually purchase,

01:52:25.400 --> 01:52:31.080
I think through the Microsoft store and Amazon for a limited time starting July 8th. But yeah,

01:52:31.080 --> 01:52:36.440
and then it's going to be free to play or alt it's coming to game pass ultimate July 1st free

01:52:36.440 --> 01:52:44.920
to play for everyone else July 15. So check that out. Another cool piece of tie in stuff is this

01:52:44.920 --> 01:52:51.560
brand new Sonic the Hedgehog DLC for Minecraft, Minecraft bedrock that is. So it's actually it's

01:52:51.560 --> 01:52:57.560
not just like skinning Minecraft to, you know, kind of Sonic kind of how they had with the

01:52:57.560 --> 01:53:03.160
Super Mario stuff. But it actually changes the gameplay quite a bit like you're actually playing

01:53:03.160 --> 01:53:07.240
it kind of like Sonic the Hedgehog. So that's pretty awesome. And they've got like the Green

01:53:07.240 --> 01:53:14.520
Hill zone, chemical plants zone, lots of other hidden things you can find in there. So worth

01:53:14.520 --> 01:53:22.200
checking out if you have Minecraft. It looks pretty, pretty expansive. You know, before we

01:53:22.200 --> 01:53:28.040
get to dark soccer stories now my brain is going to see having seen Loki's old website. I think a

01:53:28.040 --> 01:53:32.280
fun bonus. I'm not saying I'm not committing to this idea. But I'm just saying maybe I might be

01:53:32.760 --> 01:53:38.600
down for this. A fun bonus stream might be dramatic readings of our old live journal posts.

01:53:42.120 --> 01:53:45.160
You don't a lot of mine were private for a reason, Rob.

01:53:46.360 --> 01:53:50.680
I'm not saying everybody has to participate. I'm just saying it's an it's an idea.

01:53:52.360 --> 01:53:56.280
All right, maybe so you could you could use one of your old websites. You don't necessarily have

01:53:56.280 --> 01:54:00.600
to use LiveJournal. You know, I don't I don't even remember what I called those websites.

01:54:00.600 --> 01:54:03.480
Yeah. All right. All right. How about some rapid fire news?

01:54:04.360 --> 01:54:14.200
All right. Well, speaking of Sonic, Netflix is working on a new Sonic show

01:54:15.000 --> 01:54:23.400
that's called Sonic Prime. And the thing is that there's a leak about it of some of the concept

01:54:23.400 --> 01:54:29.880
artwork that came from Patrick Horan's ArtStation profile. He's a visual development and environment

01:54:29.880 --> 01:54:37.080
artist. He's worked on Rev and Roll and the Last Inspector Gadget series. And he worked freelance

01:54:37.080 --> 01:54:46.520
for studio Wild Brain that worked with Sega and Netflix for that series. And so we have an Eggman.

01:54:47.160 --> 01:54:56.280
We have Sonic hiding. We have him apparently doing the Fortnite dance. And we have a prehistoric Amy

01:54:56.280 --> 01:55:06.920
Rose. And portals. Hmm. So. We'll see. All right. Looks I mean, it looks interesting.

01:55:08.040 --> 01:55:11.880
If this is the style they go with for the art, I really, really do think it's great.

01:55:14.280 --> 01:55:22.920
Neat. And then in other news, one of my favorite ever series is getting a version for PS4 Switch,

01:55:22.920 --> 01:55:29.560
PC and arcade. Yay. And it is Superlative Night Dreams, Cotton Rock and Roll.

01:55:30.600 --> 01:55:36.840
And for anyone who doesn't know what Cotton is, it starts as this cute little witch and her name

01:55:36.840 --> 01:55:48.120
is Nata de Cotton. And she's addicted to this bad tasting candy called Willow. And so she enlists

01:55:48.120 --> 01:55:51.880
the aid of fairies and by enlist, I mean, she basically traps them and make them work for her.

01:55:53.000 --> 01:56:00.600
To go retrieve all the willow. That's only part of it. But anyway, success is the company behind

01:56:00.600 --> 01:56:05.960
it. And like I said, it's going to be out for PS4, Switch, PC and arcade. The PS4 and Switch

01:56:05.960 --> 01:56:16.600
versions will be out December 23rd in Japan for 6380 yen. PC version winter between 2021 and 2022

01:56:16.600 --> 01:56:25.480
and arcade version between summer fall 2021. There's also going to be a 30th anniversary

01:56:25.480 --> 01:56:34.600
special edition that will be 10,780 yen. So about a hundred and five hundred and six bucks

01:56:35.400 --> 01:56:42.120
that has a Nata de Cotton nendroid, the Cotton Complete Works book and the Cotton Rock and Roll

01:56:42.200 --> 01:56:50.200
original CD. So I am super happy about that. And pre-orders are already available in Japan at

01:56:50.200 --> 01:56:57.320
7net and Yobodashi. So if you're going to import it, there you go. Also confirmed is a cotton,

01:56:57.320 --> 01:57:03.320
silk and applique pumpkin. Yes, their names are all based on clothing and tailoring.

01:57:06.200 --> 01:57:10.840
One other piece of rapid fire news I want to insert in here before we get to world release

01:57:10.840 --> 01:57:15.960
dates. I want to remind everybody that the Summer Games Done Quick Marathon is coming up this week.

01:57:15.960 --> 01:57:19.960
It actually starts on July 4th, which ironically, I should also mention to the listeners,

01:57:20.520 --> 01:57:24.200
we will not be here next week. We're not going to have a live show next week because the holiday

01:57:24.200 --> 01:57:28.200
here in the States, we couldn't really get our schedules to match up. And that's OK. It's a

01:57:28.200 --> 01:57:31.880
holiday anyway. So I imagine a lot of you guys will be out doing things, especially, you know,

01:57:31.880 --> 01:57:36.440
now that more and more places and things are opening, you're probably or at least doing maybe

01:57:36.440 --> 01:57:40.840
a small gathering or something like that. I don't know. But yeah, so we're not gonna be here live.

01:57:40.840 --> 01:57:48.680
But of course, the Summer Games Done Quick Marathon starts on the 4th and runs through the

01:57:50.040 --> 01:57:55.000
10th or 11th. I can't remember the date off my head, but I do know our very own Bobby Blackwolf

01:57:55.000 --> 01:58:01.640
is going to be participating as one of the announcers as he has been for a few of those now,

01:58:01.640 --> 01:58:07.720
at least a year, all the virtual ones. So I know he's doing the overnights, I think on the 5th.

01:58:08.440 --> 01:58:11.560
And then I think a lot of you guys are going to hear him when he does the big finale,

01:58:11.560 --> 01:58:15.320
Kingdom Hearts 2. He's going to be announcing during that. Of course, it is about the speed

01:58:15.320 --> 01:58:20.920
runners and their commentators that they have on the virtual couch. So, you know, Bobby's there to

01:58:20.920 --> 01:58:25.480
get the donators read and all that stuff. So the real stars of the show are the speed runners,

01:58:25.480 --> 01:58:30.600
the charities. But it's pretty cool to kind of know somebody that's very involved with that.

01:58:30.600 --> 01:58:37.640
Absolutely. Bobby also with a big tip here. If you use hashtag VOG Network at the end of your

01:58:37.640 --> 01:58:43.640
donation during his shift, you have a higher chance. I want to underline bold, italicize,

01:58:43.640 --> 01:58:49.480
chance of getting it read or excuse me, of getting it to Bobby to potentially get read.

01:58:49.480 --> 01:58:54.600
But do not mention VOG, OLR, Bobby's podcast or anything that could be seen as self-promotion,

01:58:54.680 --> 01:59:02.040
because again, it's about the charity and about the speed runners. I even know because I donated

01:59:02.040 --> 01:59:07.480
two cycles ago and I think I made a joke about oh, I put the donator as Mr. Smoosh.

01:59:07.480 --> 01:59:14.280
I said that was the donator and it didn't get read. So there was that. I guess somebody thought,

01:59:14.280 --> 01:59:17.880
you know, it could be an entendre for something. I don't know, because I guess smoosh could mean

01:59:17.880 --> 01:59:23.480
sex or something. I don't know. Anything can mean sex. Right. And then but last time I used

01:59:23.480 --> 01:59:28.440
the hashtag and I just put a very generic like, you know, go, you know, actually, no,

01:59:28.440 --> 01:59:31.640
it wasn't generic because I think I actually referenced something that was going on in the

01:59:31.640 --> 01:59:35.720
speed run. I think I did it during the acoustic speed run and just tried to keep a positive and

01:59:35.720 --> 01:59:40.280
it made it to Bobby and got read. So that was cool. The football baby. Yeah. Yeah. The rugby

01:59:40.280 --> 01:59:44.680
baby rugby baby. Yeah. That whole thing. That was hilarious, by the way. Yeah. Bobby says don't use

01:59:44.680 --> 01:59:49.160
anything that might be an inside joke. That was the mistake I made. Although I don't think Mr.

01:59:49.160 --> 01:59:55.480
Smoosh is a joke. Mr. Smoosh is a real person. But I get it. I get it. Why that wasn't picked.

01:59:55.480 --> 01:59:59.800
And also there was no no hashtag thing back then. So I probably didn't even make it to Bobby's desk.

01:59:59.800 --> 02:00:03.320
So anyway, there you go. A little tip for you guys if you're going to be donating. But again,

02:00:03.320 --> 02:00:08.280
I was stressed. Bobby is under no obligation to read them and they are under no obligation to send

02:00:08.280 --> 02:00:11.400
them to him. If you're going to donate money, you're doing it because you appreciate the

02:00:11.400 --> 02:00:15.160
charity. I think that's that's what it's really all about. So I just want to underline bold

02:00:15.160 --> 02:00:22.840
italicize that disclaimer. OK, so there we go. No show next week. Summer games done quick.

02:00:23.960 --> 02:00:26.920
Try to think of any other housekeeping I forgot at the top of the show. I don't think so.

02:00:26.920 --> 02:00:30.760
So let's move on to world release dates. We'll start in the US. Loki.

02:00:31.560 --> 02:00:38.360
So we've got Destroy All Humans coming out for Nintendo Switch. Disgaea 6, Defiance of Destiny,

02:00:38.360 --> 02:00:45.000
also for Nintendo Switch. Ghoul Patrol on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

02:00:45.000 --> 02:00:50.200
Also with that, Zombies Ate My Neighbors on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

02:00:50.760 --> 02:00:59.160
We've got Sky Children of the Light on Nintendo Switch. Wonder Boy, Asha in Monster World on PC.

02:00:59.800 --> 02:01:05.480
And last but not least, Doki Doki Literature Club Plus on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4,

02:01:05.480 --> 02:01:12.040
PlayStation 5, Xbox One and Xbox Series X. I cannot believe we're in the year 2021 and we

02:01:12.040 --> 02:01:16.920
just had Zombies Ate My Neighbors red as a new release this week. That's so exciting.

02:01:16.920 --> 02:01:21.560
All right. Going to Japan on the Nintendo Switch, we have Summer Pockets, Reflection

02:01:21.560 --> 02:01:29.160
Blue is out this week, as well as Moshi Kashite Obaki no Shattika for Nintendo Switch

02:01:29.800 --> 02:01:33.240
is also coming out this week. Those, of course, are Nintendo Switch releases.

02:01:33.800 --> 02:01:39.080
On the PlayStation 5, I don't think we have anything coming out besides maybe a peripheral,

02:01:39.080 --> 02:01:44.280
an official wireless charger, if you want that. Cool. Otherwise, on the PlayStation 4,

02:01:45.160 --> 02:01:50.040
also nothing. It's a pretty slow week in Japan this week. Those Nintendo Switch releases are

02:01:50.040 --> 02:01:54.760
all you get. How about the UK Dark Soccer? Okay. I'm going to have to, because the way

02:01:54.760 --> 02:01:58.280
the site is done, I'm going to have to just break it up and read it a little bit differently. But

02:01:59.560 --> 02:02:04.600
on the 29th, we have Destroy All Humans for Switch. We get Curbed Space,

02:02:05.320 --> 02:02:12.920
uh, Evil Inside on the 30th, Greed Fall Gold Edition, ATV Drift and Tricks, and Distrust,

02:02:12.920 --> 02:02:19.000
looks like a big old box set of it. And then on the first, which is Winds a Day, actually nothing

02:02:19.000 --> 02:02:25.480
on the first. On the second, we have Red Wings Aces of the Sky, Mask Maker for PlayStation,

02:02:25.480 --> 02:02:31.400
Evergate. We have Nightmare Boy, Do Not Feed the Monkeys, Beholder Complete Edition,

02:02:31.400 --> 02:02:38.840
Collector's Edition. Goodness. And then that's it for this week. I could also point out the

02:02:38.840 --> 02:02:43.400
week after. Sure. Oh yeah. We weren't going to be here next week anyway, so sure. Yes. So we have

02:02:43.400 --> 02:02:48.840
In Nightmare, Dark Alliance, Oddworld Soulstorm, those are all on the sixth. On the eighth,

02:02:48.840 --> 02:02:53.240
we have Farmers vs Zombies. We have Monster Hunter Stories 2, Wings of Ruin on the ninth,

02:02:53.240 --> 02:02:57.160
Dungeons of Nihilebek, I guess, the Amulet of Chaos,

02:02:59.800 --> 02:03:04.600
Vampire the Masquerade, the Coteries of New York, and Shadows of New York.

02:03:05.720 --> 02:03:09.240
I, uh, and then some Harvest Moon and some other stuff.

02:03:10.520 --> 02:03:15.800
All right. All right. Let's get through some more stories and then we'll get to your comments from

02:03:15.800 --> 02:03:19.960
the listeners in our, uh, some of the stories you've placed in our Discord throughout the week,

02:03:20.200 --> 02:03:23.400
as well as our mailbag. Participate at orangeonshooter.com and of course,

02:03:23.400 --> 02:03:28.200
live comments from chats. Uh, but for now, let's get to a few more stories starting with Loki.

02:03:29.400 --> 02:03:35.800
Yeah. So there was this lawsuit and this sounds awfully familiar to me, but, uh, Booker T,

02:03:36.680 --> 02:03:38.840
who, uh, his... The wrestler?

02:03:38.840 --> 02:03:45.560
Yes, the wrestler. So Booker T Huffman, who had a wrestler or a character that he did

02:03:45.560 --> 02:03:51.400
back in his early wrestling days called GI Bro. Uh, apparently he was saying that that character

02:03:51.400 --> 02:04:00.680
was kind of stolen by Activision to use in Call of Duty Black Ops 4. So they have a character named

02:04:00.680 --> 02:04:09.160
Prophet, which kind of looks similar. Um, so unfortunately though, the, uh, jury didn't see

02:04:09.160 --> 02:04:16.120
it that way. They figured that it isn't an exact license or likeness, but I re they remember,

02:04:16.120 --> 02:04:22.840
like, not even that long ago, we talked about another issue where the characters like this

02:04:22.840 --> 02:04:27.560
was taken for Call of Duty game as well. And they had actually shot somebody, you know,

02:04:28.600 --> 02:04:35.720
with similar, basically the same actress with the same get, you know, outfit and everything

02:04:35.720 --> 02:04:40.120
also for Call of Duty likeness. So it's like kind of seeing a trend here a little bit,

02:04:40.120 --> 02:04:44.040
the kind of just skirt and, you know, let's make it look just like the character,

02:04:44.040 --> 02:04:49.080
but just enough so we don't get sued. Dude, the faces though, uncannily

02:04:51.640 --> 02:04:57.640
similar. Yeah, it is. And, but once again, I think it's just one of those, like, we're

02:04:57.640 --> 02:05:01.080
going to use the likeness without, you know, just making it different enough.

02:05:01.080 --> 02:05:06.680
Plaintiff does not own the idea of an angry man with a scowling look. I'm sorry. That made me

02:05:06.680 --> 02:05:14.600
laugh. Yeah. So they probably just didn't have a strong enough case, but it does seem to be like

02:05:14.600 --> 02:05:19.400
a trend that, you know, the stuff that they're getting away with. I, I feel that they're getting

02:05:19.400 --> 02:05:26.840
away with, but we'll see. I don't know. I'm sure this is not the last of these types of

02:05:26.840 --> 02:05:31.960
cases we're going to hear in a courtroom. So, I mean, go back to the top of the show.

02:05:31.960 --> 02:05:37.000
We're talking about, you know, completely, uh, going to the extent of lifting somebody's voice.

02:05:37.000 --> 02:05:43.560
I mean, you know, anyway. All right. Um, well, moving on, let's talk about, um, this is pretty

02:05:43.560 --> 02:05:48.040
big news for the Blizzard crowd this week. If you're a fan of Blizzard games, um, you probably

02:05:48.040 --> 02:05:53.880
are very excited to hear that Overwatch is now cross-play. I mean, a great idea to pump some

02:05:53.880 --> 02:05:57.880
life into a game that's, uh, I don't want to say is dying, but a game that's probably showing its

02:05:57.880 --> 02:06:02.040
age. It's been around for a few years. Hasn't really had any big updates in a while because

02:06:02.040 --> 02:06:06.120
obviously they're working on Overwatch 2. That is the big update that's going to be coming later.

02:06:06.120 --> 02:06:11.480
Um, but this is a pretty big deal to, uh, get more people excited about Overwatch and revisiting

02:06:11.480 --> 02:06:15.960
and shorten the time to find a match. I'm sure because Overwatch is now cross-play

02:06:15.960 --> 02:06:21.000
between PC, PlayStation, Xbox, and Switch, which means for the first time,

02:06:21.720 --> 02:06:26.760
console players can see chat. And I bet a lot of them are very sad about that and wish they could

02:06:26.760 --> 02:06:31.080
turn this feature off. I think actually you probably can. Uh, because if you want it,

02:06:31.080 --> 02:06:35.800
yeah, if you want to enable cross-play, you do have to make a battle net account, which, um,

02:06:35.800 --> 02:06:40.120
I'm sure many people already have. If you are a PC gamer at all, and you've ever played something

02:06:40.120 --> 02:06:44.920
like Diablo, World of Warcraft, Starcraft. Your console gamer that had the play doom,

02:06:44.920 --> 02:06:48.920
you know, I think you had to do that as well. You're thinking of a Bethesda account, but

02:06:49.480 --> 02:06:56.120
sorry. Yeah. Similar, similar train of thought, but yes, different. Um, so do you have to have

02:06:56.120 --> 02:06:59.320
a battle net account for call of duty? So there's probably a lot of people have that.

02:06:59.320 --> 02:07:05.800
Um, I don't know about consoles. Um, it's, it's the official shop on PC, but I don't know about

02:07:05.800 --> 02:07:11.240
consoles. So, but anyhow, battle net is where you do need to make an account if you don't already

02:07:11.240 --> 02:07:16.920
have one. Um, and then, uh, PC and console players will be able to join matches together for

02:07:16.920 --> 02:07:22.600
quick play arcade and custom. However, competitive will still not match. And I'm assuming that's a

02:07:22.600 --> 02:07:28.360
keyboard mouse versus controller thing. Um, but anyhow, uh, what they say about the match

02:07:28.360 --> 02:07:32.440
making process for competitive games, competitive players will be split into two pools, depending

02:07:32.440 --> 02:07:37.400
on the system, console players and PC players for balanced purposes, PC players and console players

02:07:37.400 --> 02:07:41.400
will not be mixed in the same pool for competitive matches. And I'm pretty sure they're just not

02:07:41.400 --> 02:07:49.480
saying the reason why, but I think, I think I got just explained it. So, uh, anyhow, uh, it does not

02:07:49.480 --> 02:07:54.840
unlock shared progression among consoles. So your cosmetic and your stats are still locked to

02:07:54.840 --> 02:08:01.000
whatever platform they will not transfer. Um, also there was a patch that increases the amount of

02:08:01.000 --> 02:08:06.280
damage that some heroes deal on console to try to, uh, bring a little parody with the PC version.

02:08:06.280 --> 02:08:11.720
That's very interesting. So, uh, yeah. Anyway, it's been five years since Overwatch first came

02:08:11.720 --> 02:08:15.960
out, just as a reminder. So five years later, we finally get cross play. I guess I should check

02:08:15.960 --> 02:08:21.000
that out at some point, to be honest. Um, Mike Deft in chat says, that's the only thing I'm really

02:08:21.000 --> 02:08:26.920
mad about. No cross progression seems dumb. I do agree. It's right there, but the queue times now

02:08:26.920 --> 02:08:31.960
are instant. Yeah. Oh yeah. I'm sure it opened it up a lot more for sure. For sure. It's also

02:08:31.960 --> 02:08:37.480
irritating to me that, you know, dead by daylight has the cross play, but not the cross progression

02:08:37.480 --> 02:08:43.240
unless you're talking, I think stadia and PC is it, you know, it's a very limited set of everything

02:08:43.240 --> 02:08:50.520
that it supports. Technically it's specifically stadia and steam. Oh, thank you. Yes. The other,

02:08:50.520 --> 02:08:55.160
the other services don't do it like a windows store. Yes. Thank you for calling that out

02:08:55.160 --> 02:08:58.920
because you're absolutely right. Cause I think it's ridiculous that windows game stories and

02:08:58.920 --> 02:09:05.480
cross platform with steam, what the hell cross progression anyway. Yeah. I, I, if we pay for

02:09:05.480 --> 02:09:10.520
this stuff, it should be able to go between the consoles. It really should. I mean, I somewhat

02:09:10.520 --> 02:09:17.320
understand Freddy and, uh, the shape and some of the licensed killers and maybe survivors,

02:09:17.320 --> 02:09:22.360
but the original ones, nah, that should, that should all be cross progression. But anyway,

02:09:23.000 --> 02:09:31.240
that's another argument. Uh, moving on dark Sakura. So, um, we, we like to point out when

02:09:31.240 --> 02:09:37.560
really old shit goes for a lot of money, right? Well, a game called air raid that was out on the,

02:09:37.560 --> 02:09:50.520
uh, Atari 2,600 sold for over $10,000. Um, it, uh, basically, uh, an e-commerce item processor

02:09:50.520 --> 02:09:55.720
who is at a four, uh, named Alex Juarez, who is at, uh, Fort worth, Texas based, uh,

02:09:55.720 --> 02:10:03.080
Goodwill center found a copy of air raid. Um, that was published for the Atari 2,600 in 1982 by men

02:10:03.080 --> 02:10:11.400
a vision. Um, it was very limited. Only 13 copies are known to exist. And so, uh, he,

02:10:12.520 --> 02:10:18.520
he would just go into the Atari games as they came in and he took it. Well, I mean, I guess he,

02:10:19.080 --> 02:10:24.520
I mean, I don't know if he took it, maybe he bought it from them, but yeah, something like

02:10:24.520 --> 02:10:33.320
that. Um, a complete edition previously sold for $33,433 and 30 cents in 2012. And another

02:10:33.320 --> 02:10:42.360
cartridge only sold on eBay for 3,575. So this is now Goodwill's highest selling piece item.

02:10:43.160 --> 02:10:49.160
Oh, I guess the Goodwill sold it. So I hate that they got the money. They do some shitty

02:10:49.160 --> 02:10:56.680
things to their employees, but bonds, double a six and chat says, shit air raid. I recall playing

02:10:56.680 --> 02:11:03.400
that game. Well, hold on because there were some very similar sounding games, uh, river raid being

02:11:03.400 --> 02:11:09.560
one of them. And Atari had an original called air C battle that my brain thought this game was at

02:11:09.560 --> 02:11:15.720
first, but air raid was a very specific, it was a blue cartridge that was very funky kind of shape

02:11:15.720 --> 02:11:20.600
to it. And that's what made it so unique. Um, and I, you just said there were like a limited

02:11:20.600 --> 02:11:25.880
number of these, right? So, um, you may, you may, if you have played one, that's very impressive,

02:11:25.880 --> 02:11:31.080
but, um, you may be confusing it with another Atari 2,600 classic. That's very similar sounding.

02:11:31.080 --> 02:11:37.320
So, all right. Uh, yeah. Uh, no one special says, uh, the game was sky blue and had a handle,

02:11:37.320 --> 02:11:42.920
right? Yep. Yep. Yep. So, uh, dark to see it says, yeah, that's the only downside is the Goodwill.

02:11:42.920 --> 02:11:47.880
Um, I thought it was neat to see something super rare, just randomly pop up like that. Hell yeah.

02:11:47.880 --> 02:11:51.880
Like, you know, if I happen to walk by a garage sale, I'm always going to kind of peak and see

02:11:51.880 --> 02:11:55.720
if there's any video games, you know, not that I'm like intentionally looking to flip them,

02:11:55.720 --> 02:11:58.840
but I'm just looking for like, Ooh, is there something fun in here that I just want to buy

02:11:58.840 --> 02:12:02.920
that? Oh, maybe, you know, some I can get, I want it so no one else can have it.

02:12:02.920 --> 02:12:09.640
This is mine. Uh, moving on Logie.

02:12:11.000 --> 02:12:18.680
So this is one of those unfortunate updates that, um, we see from time to time with different games

02:12:18.680 --> 02:12:26.200
that come out. So apparently Marvel's Avengers had received an update where for a brief period of

02:12:26.200 --> 02:12:32.280
time, it was not only displaying your username in game, but it was also displaying a string

02:12:32.280 --> 02:12:40.200
afterwards, which included your IP address. And so that's obviously a problem if, you know,

02:12:40.200 --> 02:12:46.520
users are having their IP address exposed to other players. Um, so thankfully, though, they did,

02:12:46.520 --> 02:12:52.520
they were able to patch this to fix the problem, but it's still kind of embarrassing that it was a

02:12:52.520 --> 02:13:00.440
problem in the first place. Yeah, that's a pretty major thing. And I can't believe they had to

02:13:00.440 --> 02:13:04.840
actually send a thing to like tell streamers, don't play this because, uh, you're not going

02:13:04.840 --> 02:13:10.920
to like the side effects of it. Basically. It's kind of sad. Yeah. Yeah. Very unfortunate. Yeah.

02:13:10.920 --> 02:13:15.240
They did. And Dr. C says, I did hear that it was finally fixed a few days after it was discovered.

02:13:15.240 --> 02:13:19.400
Yes. But that's still a few days that you have a very unfortunate side effect there in the game.

02:13:19.400 --> 02:13:23.160
Very, very, yeah. Especially if you didn't notice it, if you weren't paying attention to,

02:13:23.160 --> 02:13:28.360
you know, the text on there. I mean, it's just, that could be bad. All right. Well,

02:13:28.360 --> 02:13:33.000
lastly, hopefully there will be no, um, side effects, uh, for folks doing this. This is,

02:13:33.000 --> 02:13:38.840
uh, PAX West has declared they will be in person this year. Um, so PAX West, of course,

02:13:38.840 --> 02:13:42.360
you all know this gaming convention, it's going to be happening in person in September,

02:13:42.360 --> 02:13:46.520
and that was announced via press release. Um, and then, uh, tickets will be going on sale,

02:13:46.520 --> 02:13:52.680
$230 for the whole four day weekend, $60 for individual day passes. Um, now of course they

02:13:52.680 --> 02:13:56.920
are saying that there will be different, um, you know, it's going to be a little bit different,

02:13:56.920 --> 02:14:03.240
uh, that there'd be doing attendance limitation. And I believe I read something about masking as

02:14:03.240 --> 02:14:13.160
well. Um, Oh yes. Uh, they did say the packs organizers did say in a tweet, uh, if COVID-19

02:14:13.160 --> 02:14:17.720
remains a major barrier to safely gathering at one of our shows, we won't do it, or we will take it

02:14:17.720 --> 02:14:22.280
virtual as much as we miss even crave the togetherness and magic of packs. We will not put

02:14:22.280 --> 02:14:26.680
attendees exhibitors or our guests at risk for the sake of an event. If things aren't on the up and

02:14:27.160 --> 02:14:32.680
up, um, as I think we got into last year in 2020, a lot of these companies are contractually

02:14:32.680 --> 02:14:38.440
obliged to do something, um, or they could lose everything for good. So, um, I, this comes as no

02:14:38.440 --> 02:14:44.520
surprise to me that packs is happening, um, dragon cons the same weekend. And as to, as of today,

02:14:44.520 --> 02:14:50.280
uh, the plan is I'm going to dragon con. Um, but, uh, you know, again, I'm going to watch

02:14:50.280 --> 02:14:55.560
everything and watch science most importantly. And if, uh, CDC comes out and says, don't do it,

02:14:55.560 --> 02:15:00.520
then we won't do it. But for now we'll see. I'm I gotta say I was out and about in San Francisco

02:15:00.520 --> 02:15:08.680
yesterday. And, uh, I, I was kind of surprised at how busy everything was. I had the Castro was

02:15:08.680 --> 02:15:14.120
still full on in pride mode, even though there wasn't an official pride. So it was very

02:15:14.120 --> 02:15:21.720
interesting. Yeah. So, um, but I'm vaccinated and, uh, that crowd pretty sure they're vaccinated too.

02:15:21.720 --> 02:15:26.280
Um, sure. There's still a breakthrough risk. Um, but you know, you're taking a lot of risks

02:15:26.280 --> 02:15:32.680
whenever you get out of bed. Um, and, uh, we know that vaccines work and vaccines will certainly,

02:15:32.680 --> 02:15:38.120
um, unless you are, uh, older in your eighties, I think the average age is 83.

02:15:38.120 --> 02:15:44.440
Uh, the vaccines will certainly prevent severe like death basically. So, um, yeah. So, I mean,

02:15:45.080 --> 02:15:49.880
again, as it stands today, I don't see a problem with dragon con, but, um, I don't think it's

02:15:49.880 --> 02:15:55.720
going to be the exact same as previous years. I think I will still choose to wear a mask. Um,

02:15:55.720 --> 02:16:01.160
and I hope nobody gives me shit for that because that's my choice. Um, especially when, when in

02:16:01.160 --> 02:16:05.880
transit, basically when I'm walking from my hotel room to the panel room, I will wear a mask when

02:16:05.880 --> 02:16:10.200
I'm in the panel room on stage. I probably won't because there's kind of a built-in social

02:16:10.200 --> 02:16:18.600
distancing when you're sitting on a panel. So, uh, yeah. So, um, yeah. So anyway, lots of people,

02:16:18.600 --> 02:16:22.280
uh, talking about this PAX West, I sort of feel like it's just going to work out. Like there's

02:16:22.280 --> 02:16:27.480
enough people who are kind of like apprehensive about it that aren't going to go, but PAX wants

02:16:27.480 --> 02:16:31.480
to lower the numbers anyway. So I kind of feel like that's going to balance out. I just think

02:16:31.480 --> 02:16:37.400
the two crowds need to play nice. Like if people, if people don't want to go, then the people that

02:16:37.400 --> 02:16:41.880
are going shouldn't like say, oh, why aren't you going? Did it? No, that's somebody's choice to

02:16:41.880 --> 02:16:46.840
make at the same time. If somebody doesn't go, I don't think they need to be holier than thou

02:16:46.840 --> 02:16:53.480
to the people that are going to go. Um, because again, vaccines exist and that's why we took them.

02:16:53.480 --> 02:17:00.600
So we'll see. Um, going into our chat over twitch.tv slash a vog network, uh, pod culture

02:17:00.600 --> 02:17:06.040
says my 99, almost 100 year old grandma is vaccinated. Good, good. And that I hope she,

02:17:06.040 --> 02:17:09.960
she should have been one of the first ones to get it. I know my dad got vaccinated all the way back

02:17:09.960 --> 02:17:15.960
in early February, but he's in his eighties. Um, so he was in that early group. Yeah. All right,

02:17:15.960 --> 02:17:21.080
let's get to the listener round table. We are going to, uh, talk to you guys through various

02:17:21.080 --> 02:17:25.560
methods that you can use to participate with our show. Um, I'll log into discord here in a minute

02:17:25.560 --> 02:17:30.920
at vog network.com slash discord. But first I think we'll go to dark Sakura with our mail bag

02:17:30.920 --> 02:17:38.520
participate at orange lounge, radio.com. So we have two emails. One of them I will just start

02:17:38.520 --> 02:17:47.320
off with hello peoples. Um, there is a, uh, link, uh, from variety about drag race. According to

02:17:47.320 --> 02:17:52.440
variety, one of the great camp classics of 1970s television is getting a drag makeover.

02:17:52.440 --> 02:17:57.000
Apparently several alumni of RuPaul's drag race will recreate an episode of the Brady bunch for

02:17:57.000 --> 02:18:02.520
paramount plus which category does this event fall under a, a reason to take advantage of the

02:18:02.520 --> 02:18:07.640
free child paramount plus B a reason to reactivate your subscription to paramount plus, which you

02:18:07.640 --> 02:18:12.200
deactivated because you ran out of episodes of star Trek discovery to watch C a reason to

02:18:12.200 --> 02:18:17.640
subscribe to paramount plus using a credit card number you got from the dark net D a reason to

02:18:17.640 --> 02:18:22.920
spend the premiere weekend getting drunk off whiskey from high west. I'm not going to

02:18:22.920 --> 02:18:27.480
advertise the distillery final state high west distillery. I don't know who they are. I know

02:18:27.480 --> 02:18:34.680
which one I'm choosing. Stay care entertainment. Uh, I, I, please don't let us do free advertisement.

02:18:35.320 --> 02:18:39.720
Yeah, I just, even though we totally do it, I know I was just to say, but you just advertise

02:18:39.720 --> 02:18:44.600
the Brady bunch special and paramount plus, so you might as well throw in the whiskey thing too.

02:18:44.600 --> 02:18:53.560
I'm going to use somebody else's subscription. Um, yeah, I have sure I have paramount plus and,

02:18:53.560 --> 02:18:58.520
um, it's, it's fine. I think, I don't think irritation that people have with paramount

02:18:58.520 --> 02:19:03.560
plus is specific, specifically about paramount plus, but people have an irritation that there

02:19:03.560 --> 02:19:09.000
are all these different streaming services when Netflix was supposed to be the catch all be all.

02:19:09.000 --> 02:19:14.440
Right. But at the same time, I think if we want there to be competition and we want to make sure

02:19:14.440 --> 02:19:17.400
that, you know, they're all trying to one up each other, there's going to have to be several of

02:19:17.400 --> 02:19:22.040
these. I just think now people are starting to feel like there's too many and I get that,

02:19:22.040 --> 02:19:26.760
believe me, I get that, but there's certainly, I canceled Disney plus I wasn't using it enough.

02:19:27.080 --> 02:19:29.080
I can't pay for the year. Um,

02:19:30.920 --> 02:19:33.880
we'll see, but that's, and then, then I start, I start trading them.

02:19:33.880 --> 02:19:37.160
So like I'll borrow somebody's Disney plus and give them my paramount plus,

02:19:37.160 --> 02:19:40.520
but I've had paramount plus ever since it was CBS all access for the star Trek thing

02:19:40.520 --> 02:19:45.880
that was referred to in the email. Um, so yeah, I mean, I'm using it to watch all stars,

02:19:45.880 --> 02:19:49.400
but that wasn't like the reason I got it. I got it for star Trek and there's a

02:19:49.400 --> 02:19:53.960
decent amount of stuff on there. I feel like as far as, um, those services go,

02:19:53.960 --> 02:19:59.160
I feel like paramount plus probably is one of the stronger ones. Um, but it depends on what

02:19:59.160 --> 02:20:03.880
you like. I don't have HBO max, but I know a lot of people are super into it. I could give a shit

02:20:03.880 --> 02:20:10.440
about friends. Um, but there's other stuff on there too. I guess people like, so anyway. Um,

02:20:10.440 --> 02:20:14.600
yes, I will. I, since I already have paramount plus I've been subbed for years services with CBS

02:20:14.600 --> 02:20:20.280
all access ever since I think I first subbed to CBS all access for the big brother live feeds.

02:20:20.280 --> 02:20:24.440
And since it's only like $5 a month, but that seat, that show has really gone to shit the past

02:20:24.440 --> 02:20:29.480
two or three years, especially just the castings horrific. Um, so, uh, I don't really watch live

02:20:29.480 --> 02:20:33.880
feeds anymore, but I watched the star Trek and the other stuff. So yeah, I'll watch this Brady

02:20:33.880 --> 02:20:37.880
bunch special. I didn't even realize it was a thing until today when somebody showed me a picture or

02:20:37.880 --> 02:20:42.120
it was actually Alan that showed me a picture of candy muse dressed as, uh, I think it was Jan,

02:20:42.920 --> 02:20:47.320
no, which Cindy was Cindy Brady. And I just kind of laughed. I thought it was funny.

02:20:47.320 --> 02:20:51.800
So, cause somebody, uh, photoshopped the gun meme onto that. So it looked like candy muse

02:20:51.800 --> 02:20:58.120
as Cindy Brady holding a gun. That's funny. That's funny. All right. Anyway, um, I'll have to find

02:20:58.120 --> 02:21:05.400
the picture and share it with you. All right. Uh, we have more emails, right? Um, yeah. Did I

02:21:05.400 --> 02:21:10.920
actually click? No, I didn't. Good. Um, hi, you're a fly on the wall for one boardroom meeting in

02:21:10.920 --> 02:21:18.680
gaming history. Which one do you pick? And this comes from D you're a fly on the wall in a board

02:21:18.680 --> 02:21:27.240
room in gaming's history. Trying to find that picture for dark soccer. Sorry. Um, I know I

02:21:27.240 --> 02:21:33.960
would want to be in the boardroom when they decided on the name, we, you and why I want to know what

02:21:33.960 --> 02:21:38.760
the hell they were thinking. I want to know what drugs were on the table that they were all, uh,

02:21:38.760 --> 02:21:44.200
taken. I'm just, I'm half kidding, but I, uh, since, since I'm announcing which Hills I'm

02:21:44.200 --> 02:21:50.280
going to die on tonight, here's another one. Um, the Wii U was tanked by its name period.

02:21:50.280 --> 02:21:55.880
That is the worst name console I think we've ever had. I may, I may regret that comment later,

02:21:55.880 --> 02:22:00.040
but it's one of the worst game name consoles we've ever had. Um, and I want to know what the

02:22:00.040 --> 02:22:03.960
hell they were thinking with that name, especially when it looked and it felt nothing like their

02:22:04.040 --> 02:22:09.960
original Wii. I just, I don't get it. So I want to know, I want to know what the alternative names

02:22:09.960 --> 02:22:16.360
were that they didn't go through with. And I want to know who was fighting for those names and why.

02:22:17.400 --> 02:22:23.320
Well, I know what I would want. What's that? The meeting where they decided to go with Jerry

02:22:23.320 --> 02:22:29.480
Lawson's, uh, game designs for the fair child channel F because it's because of him. We have

02:22:29.480 --> 02:22:35.560
cartridges going way back in history. I like that. I am. Yeah. And then I also know why the

02:22:35.560 --> 02:22:40.920
fuck they did that controller design. Cause it was shit. Um, and yeah, if we're going to talk,

02:22:40.920 --> 02:22:45.960
go way back, then I definitely want to be in some boardrooms, uh, in the old Atari days,

02:22:45.960 --> 02:22:50.200
because there probably were drugs on the table. And I'm very curious about what all was going

02:22:50.200 --> 02:22:54.600
on then. Cause I don't know if y'all know, but a lot of your favorite eighties games were absolutely

02:22:54.600 --> 02:22:59.560
drug and drug influenced. Absolutely. So it's, uh, I think that'd be interesting. Not that I

02:22:59.560 --> 02:23:04.840
condone, not that I condone it, but I just think we should face that reality. I just want to be in

02:23:04.840 --> 02:23:10.040
the boardrooms and they complained about Steve jobs. I would, I'll take the board. I'll take

02:23:10.040 --> 02:23:17.640
the boardroom, um, the directly after the E3 that Konami unveiled the Brock revolution and all the

02:23:17.640 --> 02:23:23.400
fallout from all that. I want to be in that boardroom to see the folks getting yelled out

02:23:23.400 --> 02:23:29.640
about just that. And about like 99 nights and how they displayed that. And just, just like

02:23:30.440 --> 02:23:37.080
the, what the, what the heck? Or, uh, when they decided not to do a sweet code and game so I

02:23:37.080 --> 02:23:45.320
can jump out of the wall and go, you idiots, you absolute fucking idiots. Oh, well, or in the,

02:23:45.320 --> 02:23:51.800
the boardroom, when the folks that did, uh, scabins, uh, Chateau Reneau, we were talking

02:23:51.800 --> 02:23:56.840
about these weird Americans who are talking about their game. That is a great answer. That is,

02:23:56.840 --> 02:24:00.520
I want to definitely, I don't know if that wouldn't necessarily do a boardroom, but it was

02:24:00.520 --> 02:24:05.800
definitely in a conference room with the marketing team. That is a great answer. I'm, I, I, carbon

02:24:05.800 --> 02:24:12.120
copy on that answer. That's, I want to know the reaction to when president cat happened

02:24:12.120 --> 02:24:17.240
and that company. That's great. I got orange rounds radio.

02:24:20.840 --> 02:24:26.680
Like who is, who's that? Who is that? Uh, great question. That was a really good question.

02:24:26.680 --> 02:24:31.400
All right. Yeah. Props to you. I don't know if I can give you a gold star cause the email

02:24:31.400 --> 02:24:36.440
was kind of short, but you definitely get a silver star. Is it the silver star story?

02:24:37.000 --> 02:24:45.000
Sure. Is it lunar? Sure. Girl. Okay. All right. That's it for emails this week, right?

02:24:45.720 --> 02:24:51.720
Yeah, it is. All right. Um, there was a good question in chat, twitch.tv slash vog network,

02:24:51.720 --> 02:24:57.640
no one special 77, which by the way, no one special. Can you please email the show

02:24:57.640 --> 02:25:03.560
or email me personally? Rob at vog network.com. Um, I received a really heartfelt reply to your

02:25:03.560 --> 02:25:07.560
question last week in my Twitter DMS. And I want to forward that to you. That just occurred in my

02:25:07.560 --> 02:25:12.280
mind that I needed to send that to you, um, uh, from somebody who's dealing with something similar.

02:25:12.280 --> 02:25:17.160
So I wanted to send, send that to you. No one special. Anyway, for now, let me read the question,

02:25:17.160 --> 02:25:23.960
uh, from this week. No one special asks, you know, how in the early two thousands video games,

02:25:23.960 --> 02:25:31.000
OST internet radio stations were all the rage. Yes. No one special. We're a little bit aware.

02:25:31.640 --> 02:25:36.840
I'm, I'm laughing with you, not at you because, uh, appropriately on our 19th anniversary,

02:25:36.840 --> 02:25:39.960
if you think about it, the roots of orange lounge radio, if you didn't already know,

02:25:39.960 --> 02:25:46.680
we were a live 365 station and the highlight of the station was the Sunday night life. Well,

02:25:46.680 --> 02:25:51.080
you know, I thought it was the highlight was the Sunday night show. And there were other shows

02:25:51.080 --> 02:25:57.160
throughout the run on life 365. We had, um, uh, remember DMN who has a different name. Now he

02:25:57.160 --> 02:26:03.400
was DMN back in the day. Uh, and then DJ tyrant was on our network. Uh, stay tight. He was here

02:26:03.400 --> 02:26:09.000
and they had a show. Um, and then, uh, there was, I had like two or three spinoff shows at one point

02:26:09.000 --> 02:26:13.880
on the network. But anyway, yes, we played gaming soundtracks. I sent you the picture, right? All

02:26:13.880 --> 02:26:19.480
right. Isn't it great? I'm saving that forever. It's going to be a reaction for me. All right.

02:26:19.480 --> 02:26:24.760
You can thank Alan for that one. Alan, that was the Cindy Brady candy muse gun meme.

02:26:25.640 --> 02:26:31.640
That's the best thing to ever happen. Right. Anyway. Um, sorry, let me get to no one specials

02:26:31.640 --> 02:26:35.080
actual question here. So, you know, how in the early 2000s video games, OST internet radio

02:26:35.080 --> 02:26:41.480
stations were all the rage in this day and age. Can we see a resurgence of those or have they

02:26:41.480 --> 02:26:48.680
gone the way of the dodo due to DMCA? Um, I don't think they've gone the way of the dodo. I don't

02:26:48.680 --> 02:26:54.680
think they're extinct, but I think the demand for those has gone down a bit because, and I, you

02:26:54.680 --> 02:26:58.840
know, I feel like I can speak with some of, somewhat of an authority to this. When we were

02:26:58.840 --> 02:27:02.840
doing orange on radio on life through 65, everything was legal because we paid a fee to

02:27:02.840 --> 02:27:08.440
live through 65 to broadcast on there. And they in turn paid the rate, the, the, the music labels.

02:27:08.440 --> 02:27:13.880
My understanding is life through 65 and services like that are still around. And absolutely there's

02:27:14.760 --> 02:27:19.240
still there. I actually had to go to their website so that I could remember if that's exactly what

02:27:19.240 --> 02:27:24.360
the website was when I did our, I did our Guinness thing. And actually, I'm sorry, I, the, the correct

02:27:24.360 --> 02:27:29.480
terminology, we shouldn't say it's still there. We should say it died and was resurrected by

02:27:29.480 --> 02:27:34.760
somebody else. That's kind of what happened. It's a reincarnation, your reincarnation. Um, so that

02:27:34.760 --> 02:27:39.000
it's, it went the MySpace way. It's not really well, but I think they are still like live radio

02:27:39.000 --> 02:27:42.600
and all that stuff. Uh, and then of course, shout cast is still out there. Shout cast was the

02:27:42.600 --> 02:27:47.960
technology that carried this show. Um, for the first 17 years, we didn't make the move to Twitch

02:27:47.960 --> 02:27:54.040
until the beginning of 2019, January, 2019, maybe December actually. Um, but anyhow, um,

02:27:56.040 --> 02:28:01.320
um, my point is, is that, uh, shout cast still exists and you can find that on shout cast.

02:28:01.320 --> 02:28:08.040
The legal question ability of that stuff is a little bit in doubt. Um, but there are services

02:28:08.040 --> 02:28:13.960
like life 365 that will pay other, you know, folks to do that, uh, and the music rates,

02:28:13.960 --> 02:28:21.000
but also, um, and my real answer, sorry, blah, blah, blah. But, um, the big factor that didn't

02:28:21.000 --> 02:28:28.440
exist in 2002 and 2003, when we were first doing this, that exists now is streaming. It's Spotify,

02:28:28.440 --> 02:28:34.840
it's Apple music, it's Pandora. It's not just streaming, but it's the fact that these Japanese

02:28:34.840 --> 02:28:41.080
gaming companies, uh, and American ones too, have now embraced, most of them have embraced

02:28:41.080 --> 02:28:47.080
the streaming technology. So you can go on and find official final fantasy soundtracks

02:28:47.080 --> 02:28:52.200
on Spotify. You can find official soundtracks to lots of Namco games. I know we're up there.

02:28:52.200 --> 02:28:58.200
Capcom games are up there and so on and so on. So a lot of people are getting it on demand,

02:28:58.200 --> 02:29:02.760
maybe not so much DDR. I think probably because you have a lot of license issues in play there,

02:29:03.000 --> 02:29:07.160
because you have very, very old license that are expired. So they're not on streaming services,

02:29:07.160 --> 02:29:11.960
but I think those games we have to admit are pretty niche when we talk about video game

02:29:11.960 --> 02:29:18.120
soundtracks altogether. Um, so that I think streaming has really cut into that is really

02:29:18.120 --> 02:29:25.240
my long roundabout way of your answer. Um, but no one special wherever there is an internet,

02:29:25.240 --> 02:29:29.320
there will always be someone doing something you're thinking about right now on it.

02:29:29.320 --> 02:29:37.000
If you know what I mean. Um, let's see. Tiger con chat says mix cloud started a streaming

02:29:37.000 --> 02:29:41.400
service for DJs to broadcast their live sets to avoid any of the copyright issues. That's smart.

02:29:41.400 --> 02:29:45.960
That's very smart. And I was also going to say no one special. I think a lot of the audience for

02:29:45.960 --> 02:29:53.640
that went to Twitch slash YouTube slash I guess Facebook gaming, uh, slash, you know, those types

02:29:53.640 --> 02:29:58.760
of, uh, video, video on demand services. Um, I think a lot of the audience went there and

02:29:58.760 --> 02:30:03.400
that's a big reason why we're on Twitch. To be honest, uh, quest buster does point out. There's

02:30:03.400 --> 02:30:09.720
a few on YouTube that stream video game tracks and I, YouTube will have the legal and the

02:30:09.720 --> 02:30:15.240
questionably legal stuff on there. So I, I YouTube is a great call out. Um, other ones I found were

02:30:15.240 --> 02:30:19.800
bundled under other services, but there's also outfits like radio Sega that does radio type

02:30:19.800 --> 02:30:25.080
shows. And I've been broadcasting classic Sega music for years. Um, our friends, uh,

02:30:25.080 --> 02:30:29.800
with girls gone. Wow. That used to be here at the voice of geeks network. They left the network

02:30:29.800 --> 02:30:34.680
because they went to Warcraft radio, which broadcast 24 seven about Warcraft radio. And I

02:30:34.680 --> 02:30:39.720
get it. They're a Warcraft show. Why wouldn't they want to be on a Warcraft network? So they went

02:30:39.720 --> 02:30:43.640
over there and, uh, I, I know they do a lot of talk programming, but I'm pretty sure they've

02:30:43.640 --> 02:30:48.600
got to play some music from the games in between all that stuff. So, um, you know, there's that

02:30:48.600 --> 02:30:53.560
that exists as well for sure. So, all right. It's weird as I actually see a lot of folks,

02:30:53.560 --> 02:30:59.400
um, big streamers out there, they're using Nintendo music, like animal crossing and stuff

02:30:59.400 --> 02:31:06.200
like that in their streams, which I think is just completely bold to do considering how litigious

02:31:06.200 --> 02:31:10.840
Nintendo is. Do you know how many memes I've seen with the Wii shop music though?

02:31:12.280 --> 02:31:17.640
Like there's a great drag race clip out there of Brooklyn Heights in untucked when she's like

02:31:17.640 --> 02:31:23.160
cringing and all this, and it's set to the Wii shop music. And it's so funny. You've seen that

02:31:23.160 --> 02:31:28.120
dark Sakura. I've heard of it. I haven't seen it. Oh, I got to find it. It's great. All right.

02:31:28.120 --> 02:31:33.880
Anyway, uh, enough, uh, enough of the, uh, um, chat question there, but that was a very good

02:31:33.880 --> 02:31:37.640
question. Thank you. No one special. Uh, and you, I'm going to also give you a silver star

02:31:37.640 --> 02:31:42.200
because that was a question that had nothing to do with the stores or sales or anything like that.

02:31:42.200 --> 02:31:47.240
And that was another very good question. So a silver star for you. All right. Maybe you can

02:31:47.240 --> 02:31:52.120
combine your star with our emailer and then you'll have one gold star. Maybe that's a currency.

02:31:52.120 --> 02:32:00.520
We need to start here at OLR. All right. Uh, I would love to have our own Bitcoin. Are you

02:32:00.520 --> 02:32:04.920
kidding? Even though I think some of it's really silly. I think it's just like a parody. It'd be

02:32:04.920 --> 02:32:09.560
fun. All right. Uh, in, in, on a serious note, uh, Loki, any last minute stories? I'm pulling

02:32:09.560 --> 02:32:16.440
up our discord here and yeah, we've got lots of depressing news. Let's go into it. So, so start

02:32:16.440 --> 02:32:26.600
starting off, uh, we had a developer of, um, the emulator, uh, or the SNES emulator, um,

02:32:26.600 --> 02:32:34.840
B SNES and high again near he has taken his life. So, um, I actually saw this in cause I have

02:32:34.840 --> 02:32:40.680
followed the, the nest of community and stuff. So I actually saw this in our discord and, uh,

02:32:40.680 --> 02:32:45.960
I didn't really know who he was, but I knew he was a developer. I just didn't know on an emulator,

02:32:46.040 --> 02:32:52.760
but apparently this is from a long, basically lots of online harassment that he's been receiving

02:32:52.760 --> 02:32:59.560
cyber bullying. Um, I guess a lot of it coming from this hub called Kiwi farms, but yeah,

02:32:59.560 --> 02:33:07.720
apparently it's just added up over time. And he kind of put out this long thread on Twitter,

02:33:07.720 --> 02:33:14.120
you know, basically saying goodbye. So that was kind of a red flag right there. And then

02:33:14.600 --> 02:33:18.120
I need to make sure I need to make sure this isn't sugar coated because it's

02:33:18.120 --> 02:33:21.320
fucking pride month and we're not going to do that. And looky, I'm not blaming you. I'm

02:33:21.320 --> 02:33:26.520
saying this story. We need to call this out is my understanding is that near or a view,

02:33:26.520 --> 02:33:32.840
I think was another name that was used previously. It was non-binary. Um, although I think they were,

02:33:32.840 --> 02:33:38.120
well, I think I'm not sure the pronouns were ever clarified, but to be fair, uh, they, they,

02:33:38.120 --> 02:33:45.480
they identified as non-binary. Um, how, however, what's gross about it is that this website that

02:33:45.480 --> 02:33:50.680
you had mentioned, uh, what was the name of that site again? Kiwi farms was targeting this

02:33:50.680 --> 02:33:55.720
individual because they were non-binary and that's the gross shit that has to be called out because

02:33:55.720 --> 02:34:01.000
that is, I mean, I'm, I was going to say it's unforgivable. It's unforgivable. I was going

02:34:01.000 --> 02:34:06.200
to sit here and get very angry and say it's unacceptable because it is, but I'm not sure

02:34:06.280 --> 02:34:12.360
what getting angry is going to do because now, if you're wondering when is this cyber bullying

02:34:12.360 --> 02:34:18.120
going to get to the point where somebody does something very, very, here we are.

02:34:19.480 --> 02:34:26.200
It's, it's now happened. So if you visit the, I don't think any OLR people do this,

02:34:26.200 --> 02:34:28.840
but I'm just going to say this, even if I'm saying it to the choir,

02:34:28.840 --> 02:34:36.200
if you visit these websites, if you post on these forums, if you contribute to this culture,

02:34:37.800 --> 02:34:44.440
I want you to sit there and really think long and hard about this. And I want you to wonder how good

02:34:44.440 --> 02:34:53.080
you feel about this. This, this is horrible. This, that culture targeting people based on

02:34:54.040 --> 02:35:04.120
who they are disgusting, flush it down the internet, flush it away. Anyway,

02:35:04.840 --> 02:35:11.800
that's all I have to say. Sorry. Thank you. And then, uh, going from that, uh, river, uh,

02:35:11.800 --> 02:35:18.280
the real life dog counterpart for the in game dog dog meat from final out four has also died.

02:35:19.240 --> 02:35:26.680
No. Oh yeah. I heard about that too. Oh, that's, that's sad. Yeah. Yeah. Losing pets is very hard.

02:35:28.520 --> 02:35:34.280
All right. So there you go. I'm like, can you give us one more story,

02:35:34.280 --> 02:35:40.600
please? To change the tone. Um, all right. Raccoon city police department still isn't

02:35:40.600 --> 02:35:45.640
playable except in custom matches for dead by daylight. Okay. Um, wait, I'm going to,

02:35:45.640 --> 02:35:50.280
I'm going to find something from our discord over at vog network.com slash discord,

02:35:50.280 --> 02:35:54.120
where people post stories throughout the week in the orange lounge radio channel.

02:35:54.120 --> 02:35:58.200
And we'd like to read some of that on air, although a lot of these, we did get to, okay,

02:35:58.200 --> 02:36:04.200
this one's funny. I'll do this one. So this is funny. Um, 13 X forever actually posted a tweet,

02:36:04.200 --> 02:36:10.280
uh, from user way bullocks, not to be confused with, you know, who, um, but it is, um, I'm not

02:36:10.280 --> 02:36:15.240
a lawyer or anything, but this feels like a lawsuit waiting to happen. And it's a screen grab from

02:36:15.640 --> 02:36:21.720
evil two and then a screen grab for the walking dead survivors. That is literally pictures

02:36:21.720 --> 02:36:27.800
photoshopped right on top of the resident evil to cover art. So somebody made a boo-boo there.

02:36:27.800 --> 02:36:33.560
However, in reading the replies, some people are saying that this was all made up. Um,

02:36:33.560 --> 02:36:37.560
but then other people are saying, no, it was an advertisement that they were using.

02:36:37.560 --> 02:36:42.360
So there's a little bit of controversy as to, is the artwork real or not? So take it with a

02:36:42.360 --> 02:36:47.720
grain of salt, I suppose, but I could certainly see something like that with a salt lick. Yeah,

02:36:47.720 --> 02:36:53.880
for sure. For sure. Um, let's see. And then, uh, Oh, this is interesting from dungeon buster.

02:36:53.880 --> 02:36:59.480
TSR games is back the studio behind the original dungeons and dragons, like those old school.

02:36:59.480 --> 02:37:03.720
I'm talking to the old school games on like Commodore 64, apple two E, you know, the old,

02:37:03.720 --> 02:37:09.480
old school ones, uh, they have returned to Lake Geneva, Wisconsin under Gary Gygax Jr.

02:37:10.200 --> 02:37:16.120
That's right. Yeah. So they're coming back. That's an official press release from a PR.com

02:37:17.000 --> 02:37:19.880
link there in our discord. That is really cool. I wonder what they're going to make.

02:37:20.920 --> 02:37:27.080
Hmm. Very cool. I don't have the license for D and D cause that was sold. Yeah,

02:37:27.080 --> 02:37:31.960
but they could still do something maybe inspired by the old inspired by is the keyword there.

02:37:31.960 --> 02:37:38.200
And especially the old games, who knows there. So, um, anyway, um, uh, that is a very much happier

02:37:38.200 --> 02:37:42.360
note to end on. There's a, that studio coming back. Very, very cool. Um,

02:37:44.920 --> 02:37:52.200
go ahead, family in general is questionable. Uh, yeah, but you know, I understand if they

02:37:52.200 --> 02:37:58.120
want to get the license, they have to maybe make deals that, you know, no, I'm just saying

02:37:58.120 --> 02:38:04.600
as people. Yeah, I know. All right. Anyhow, let's get to our final thoughts for tonight,

02:38:05.080 --> 02:38:09.560
and wrap the show up. Uh, and, uh, thank you guys once again for listening to our show and

02:38:09.560 --> 02:38:13.560

02:38:20.440 --> 02:38:25.080
well then what can we do? So, um, yes, please help us spread the word. Um, a nice five star

02:38:25.080 --> 02:38:29.320

02:38:29.320 --> 02:38:35.320
long way. Uh, and, um, yeah, social media posts, uh, auto hosts here on Twitch are wonderful.

02:38:35.320 --> 02:38:39.240
Thank you to everybody who auto hosts Vogue network here on Twitch. Um, I also want to

02:38:39.240 --> 02:38:43.640

02:39:27.720 --> 02:39:34.600

02:39:34.600 --> 02:39:39.560
by daylight because that's my addiction right now. People are already setting out, setting off

02:39:39.560 --> 02:39:47.560
fucking fireworks outside and I want to set them on fire. All right. Have a good one. Uh, Loki,

02:39:47.560 --> 02:39:52.520
how about you? Your final thought tonight? Uh, still gonna be working on more Minecraft.

02:39:52.520 --> 02:39:55.960
Hopefully I'll have another episode out this week. At least that's what I'm going for.

02:39:56.600 --> 02:40:03.240
Um, can't wait for you to see my shop. It's very cute. Um, and then my final thought tonight,

02:40:03.240 --> 02:40:07.160
um, just, you know, I, I have lots of other projects I want to work on, but I have some

02:40:07.160 --> 02:40:10.920
other things in my personal life. There could be some big changes coming in the next week or two.

02:40:10.920 --> 02:40:16.280
So everybody crushed fingers and happy vibes. Uh, that's all I really need. Thank you. Thank you.

02:40:16.280 --> 02:40:21.640
Um, and thanks everybody for sticking with us for the last 19 years, whether you found us 19 years

02:40:21.640 --> 02:40:27.000
ago or 19 minutes ago, really appreciate you guys being here, um, at orange launch radio. Thanks.

02:40:27.000 --> 02:40:32.920
And we will be back in two weeks. Um, everybody in the States have a happy, have a safe, um,

02:40:32.920 --> 02:40:38.440
but have a very positive 4th of July, especially after the last 15 months. Um, I hope you have a

02:40:38.440 --> 02:40:42.840
great one, but please be safe, uh, in all elements of the word for those of you in other countries.

02:40:42.840 --> 02:40:47.080
I know the 4th of July is just another day. Uh, so I'm sorry, we won't be here next week,

02:40:47.080 --> 02:40:51.400
but I still hope no matter what you're doing next Sunday, um, you're, you're having a good

02:40:51.400 --> 02:40:56.760
time. You're safe, having fun with video games and all that stuff. Have a wonderful two weeks.

02:40:56.760 --> 02:41:01.960
We'll be back on July 11th to do it all again. Good luck to Bobby and summer games done quick.

02:41:01.960 --> 02:41:07.000
I'm looking forward to watching, uh, and donating for the charity doctors without borders. Uh,

02:41:07.000 --> 02:41:10.280
I don't think I have anything else to squeeze in here at the end. So it's time to roll the credits.

02:41:10.280 --> 02:41:16.920
