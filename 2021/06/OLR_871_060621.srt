00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,400
This week, No Man's Sky rolled out a significant visual overhaul. One of the games produced

2
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:18,680
a groundswell of hype, came out two years later to mixed but generally negative acclaim,

3
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:22,520
and persisted with notable content and other updates for the next five years. I haven't

4
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:26,560
seen this outside of an MMO, and graphically speaking, I haven't seen this in an MMO

5
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:27,560
either.

6
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:30,720
This is the headline about a total makeover. Now it's time for your hosts Rob Roberts,

7
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:33,920
Jamie Summers, and Loki to tell you more about this and the rest of the week's gaming news.

8
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:36,040
Starting right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.

9
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:45,680
Hello my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show

10
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:53,240
where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio, and we are live once again after

11
00:00:53,240 --> 00:01:01,840
a little break last week with episode number 871 of our show for this June the 6th of 2021.

12
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:07,440
My name is Rob Roberts and I have no idea why my camera went itty bitty on Twitch. We

13
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:14,840
do tape live every Sunday night at twitch.tv slash VOG Network, six o'clock Pacific, nine

14
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:20,520
o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby Black Wolf show and sometimes live weird things

15
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:21,520
happen.

16
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:29,000
If you're supposed to be recording vertical video, that is a big faux pas.

17
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,600
I think there's a brand new OBS that just came out between the time we did our last

18
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:40,240
show and this one, and I think it did something to resetting the webcam specs, so I will just

19
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:41,880
have to get that sorted.

20
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:45,860
But at least you can see my co-hosts, they look fine as we're taping live on Twitch,

21
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:49,760
such as Techmaster Loki who popped in there. Hi Loki, how are you?

22
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:51,080
I'm fine.

23
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:54,560
And of course, let's not forget the one and only DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

24
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:55,560
Hi.

25
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:56,560
Hi, how are you Jamie?

26
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,560
I'm okay, I'm tired.

27
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:03,080
Tired? Well, you've been going like out and about these last few days, right?

28
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:08,000
Well, I had, okay, so first of all, I had a sister event that I thought was next week,

29
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:14,280
it was actually yesterday, but I had taken yesterday off. So I took Becky to San Francisco

30
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:21,800
for her birthday, a late birthday present, so that she could, as she said, not be a mom

31
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:22,800
for a day.

32
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,560
I like that.

33
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:29,400
And so we hung out in the Castro and yay, it was Castro during Pride Month, so it was

34
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,400
nuts.

35
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,860
I like that.

36
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:40,800
And then we went to, we ate at Cafe Mystique, which is really delicious. And then we went

37
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:49,440
to Japantown because I needed to go to Kinokuniya for a kanji book. And then I needed to go

38
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:57,280
to Nijia. Now, Nijia Market, they've, it's already really small, but they've really adapted

39
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:03,120
to the whole COVID thing. There were lines outside of everything, even to get into Daiso,

40
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,120
so it was kind of nuts and funny.

41
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,120
Oh my gosh.

42
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:14,080
Let's go. But all that walking with my back and my other condition. Yeah. By the time

43
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:18,960
we got back, I was, I was deadbeat.

44
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:22,840
And now I turned into huge Rob, but at least I figured out what the issue was. There we

45
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:26,840
go. All right. I'll fix that, guys. Sorry. Sorry. I know this is like the most-

46
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,840
You just had your mushroom.

47
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:29,840
Yeah, apparently.

48
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,840
Move it around the entire time.

49
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:32,840
What was that?

50
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:35,560
I said, just keep moving it around the entire episode.

51
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:40,320
Exactly. Now I'll be big Rob. Now I'll be small Rob. See, we love our folks who listen

52
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:44,440
on the podcast feed. Of course, you can download Orange Launch Radio in your favorite podcast

53
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:49,280
app, such as Apple Podcasts, which just got a big update recently. Spotify, which has

54
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:52,800
been getting more and more into podcasts. We're on a few others too. You can download

55
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:59,320
us in those apps. But we moved over to Twitch a couple of years ago, doing our show live

56
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:03,440
on Sunday nights. And sometimes, unfortunately, on the podcast, you just miss these funny

57
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:08,160
little visual things that happen. But I think I fixed myself. How does it look, you guys?

58
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:11,760
Hopefully it looks good in our chat. Because we do, again, tape live on Sunday nights and

59
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:18,120
we have our chat room, which is over at twitch.tv slash vog network. And Sia Tabiri in the chat

60
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:23,280
says giant Rob is going to nom, nom, nom the co-host. Yes, you see there's Pac-Man and

61
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:28,840
then there's super Pac-Man. And then there's Pac-Man. Super Pac-Man. Okay, I'll stop. All

62
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:34,960
right. Let's get into our kickoff topic tonight and talk about some things that we missed

63
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:39,480
in gaming last week. First off, I hope you guys had a good week off. Dark Soccer, I know

64
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:43,340
you've been on some adventures the past few days. Also, you were you were here streaming

65
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:52,420
last week, right? Not here on your own channel, right? Yeah. I was playing Dead by Daylight

66
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:56,320
like I know I really do. And I had a really good stream. It was nice actually doing it

67
00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:02,760
a little bit earlier that night. So nice. It was it was pretty cool. Loki, did you do

68
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:06,800
anything special with the long weekend, which by which, by the way, I know I know some people

69
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:10,200
took some heat for saying like, you know, there was there was some political thing where

70
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:14,260
somebody said, have a good weekend or have a good long weekend. And I understand it's

71
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:19,900
Memorial Day and Memorial Day is not a happy holiday, but it does kind of share the distinction

72
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:25,560
this last year of being a three day weekend as, you know, America and, you know, other

73
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:29,620
parts of the world are getting to the other side of this covid thing. We're seeing numbers

74
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:33,440
really start to drop. And I think there were a lot of people wanting to really get some

75
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:38,040
normalcy back. So I think, you know, yes, even though Memorial Day is a is a holiday

76
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:42,980
that, you know, is a little bit morose because we have to, you know, be thankful to those

77
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:48,040
that gave their lives for the freedoms that we experience in this country. This particular

78
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:51,800
long weekend we just had was the first time in a very long time that many of us got to

79
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:55,520
enjoy some of those freedoms. So I think there's a little bit of sharing going on.

80
00:05:55,520 --> 00:06:01,000
So, you know, I hope people understand why I still say I hope you had a good long weekend,

81
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,520
because you know what, it's the first long weekend we've really been able to get into

82
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:09,960
in a very long time. But I'm Loki, I'm sorry for digressing. But how was your long weekend?

83
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:16,320
I am pretty sure I was just playing Minecraft. You've been doing you've been doing a lot

84
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:21,080
of Minecraft and I saw some cryptic tweets. Would you care to explain yourself or do you

85
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:25,360
want to do this later in the show? No, I can we can talk about now. Let's talk about

86
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:28,640
it now. Because even I don't know what the fuck you're talking about with your tweets.

87
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:35,960
And I got it. And this is probably going to be lost on you guys. But so I am a huge fan

88
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:40,400
of I mean, there's a lot of people that are huge fans of this group. But there's a server

89
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:44,840
called hermitcraft. They're like probably some of the most famous Minecraft players

90
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:50,400
out there. I mean, they've been running this server for years now. And I mean, they're

91
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:55,560
kind of all streamers, they all work together, they kind of have this unique community where

92
00:06:55,560 --> 00:07:01,360
they can collaborate and just do all these different projects and stuff. So it's real

93
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:08,360
exciting. So obviously, as of recent, you know, getting back into Minecraft and stuff,

94
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:18,320
one of my goals, albeit impossible, would be to someday be on hermitcraft to be able

95
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:23,760
to join them on the server as a member, which is like, yeah, get in line with all the other

96
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:27,520
people that want to do that, like every single content creator out there that like does Minecraft

97
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:33,740
stuff wants to do that. I get that. And that's like, it's, it's just astronomically, whatever.

98
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:37,680
It's fine. The only reason I want to is because like, they seem like really cool people just

99
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:41,980
to play with. Like, that's, that's it. That's really the only reason not not because I want

100
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:45,340
to, you know, play with them because they're famous or anything. It's, it's because they

101
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:49,000
just seem really cool. And like, this would be a fun group of people to play Minecraft

102
00:07:49,000 --> 00:08:00,220
with. So is the punchline you got in? No, no. Oh, okay. That's not the punchline. No,

103
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:05,560
that would be hilarious. But no, that's absolutely not the punchline. So, um, she kind of get

104
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:11,380
to the point here. So one of I follow a lot of them in social media. And one of those

105
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:17,040
folks that I follow is this guy who goes by Tango tech, who he's a big redstone guy,

106
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:22,960
and he's done, you know, lots of videos and stuff like that. Well, they had a cherry auction.

107
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:29,320
With one of the prizes being that I can have a one on one session with him. So obviously,

108
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:35,260
I bid and obviously I won. So I'm going to have him come on one of my videos that's coming

109
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:40,040
out pretty soon, like, second or third episode next week. So next week, I'll be playing with

110
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:43,700
one of the members of hermitcraft. It's got like a million followers on YouTube and stuff

111
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:48,940
like that, to just invite them onto the server, show them around, show them what I did, and

112
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:52,900
just kind of like work on a project together. So I think that's absolutely cool. Like, I

113
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:58,980
pick his brain, like content creation stuff, just, I don't know, that really, I mean, it's

114
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:04,640
like, you just got to get their attention. That's really like, if you want to, like,

115
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:08,180
have any potential possible first off, you have to have a channel to decent size, which

116
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:13,600
mine is not. But don't tell yourself short, Loki, you have been committed to that you

117
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:18,880
you have something that a lot of content creators can only aspire to have. And that is that

118
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:23,800
you've had the commitment to content creation, meaning, you know, you've been doing this

119
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:28,520
show with Jamie and I for it's going to be 19 years this month. So don't I mean, at the

120
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:33,240
same time? Well, I get it. I get it. Like, you know, sure, I don't know the individuals

121
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:36,720
directly that you're speaking of, because I don't follow the Minecraft community. But

122
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:40,500
I certainly follow other communities when dark soccer and I sit here and talk about,

123
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:44,060
you know, we're watching dead by daylight, and we're watching losing color or something,

124
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:48,580
you know, or, you know, deer or what, you know, one of the big streamers here on Twitch,

125
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:51,940
I don't expect that everybody necessarily knows those people. But you know, those that

126
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:54,940
are kind of in the community are like, Oh, yeah, those are the people that really like

127
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:58,860
dedicate themselves to, you know, streaming those those types of things, and so forth.

128
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:02,500
So I think that's super cool that you're getting a chance to and it sounds like for a charity

129
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:07,680
reason, kind of get a chance to to get this guy's ear a little bit, but don't, don't ever

130
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:12,920
think for a minute that he can't learn something from you to know, absolutely. And it's it's

131
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:17,680
not necessarily like it. Okay, aside from being able to play with the cool kids as they

132
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:23,360
put it in chat, it's also the ice so much hate the corporate job world, like I will

133
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:27,440
do anything to get out of this thing. And like I see that as like this could possibly

134
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:31,360
be an avenue to like, you know, the YouTube stuff, obviously, I don't know, it's just

135
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:35,420
like the game creation stuff. Like, yeah, if I put my mind to it, it's just it's time

136
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:40,700
like a lot of these folks that do content creation as a full time job, like, I can't

137
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:45,340
put out that level of content because I'm working a daytime job as well. And I have

138
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:51,420
a family and it's just it's so hard to cram that into them out of time, but I will do

139
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:57,940
the best I can. That's all I can really do. That's it. At the very least, it was benefiting

140
00:10:57,940 --> 00:11:03,640
the Seattle was in Seattle Shakespeare Society. So it was good to be able to put some money

141
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:09,680
down towards that. But at the same time, yeah, it's great to be able to, you know, play with

142
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:14,160
one of the hermits for a few hours. I mean, that hopefully it's not the last time but

143
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:19,400
like, you know, at the very least, it's a cool experience. I'm glad I get to share it

144
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:23,320
with the people on the server, because it's kind of like, you know, I really appreciate

145
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:28,380
them. And I think they're all big fans. So for them, it's just gonna blow their minds.

146
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:32,900
And so I just am glad to be able to share that with them. So hell yeah. Yeah, I'm just

147
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:38,060
very excited. It's gonna next week. So next week, I'm filming that I don't know, I have

148
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:42,500
an episode that's coming out soon. I'm actually working on I was hoping to have it done this

149
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:48,460
weekend. But like, I like I have done a lot of building over the last weekend. Like I

150
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:56,960
think about, gosh, 12 to 14 hours worth of Minecraft building. So I had to compress that

151
00:11:56,960 --> 00:12:04,240
down and to time lapses and stuff and touches a lot a lot of work, but lots of planning.

152
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:09,600
I am so nervous. I've got to plan all this stuff and just get everything ready to go

153
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,840
for Saturday or Sunday.

154
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:16,720
Well, let's, let's get that plugin one more time for your YouTube channel and let let

155
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:20,580
our listeners know, you know, you're you're serious about this stuff. You know, dark soccer

156
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:24,420
myself, we've plugged our twitches enough. Let's I'm sure we'll plug them again at some

157
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:27,820
point tonight. But Loki, make sure let's get your YouTube out there. And you know, if you

158
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:31,440
guys have any interest in Minecraft, even a passing interest in Minecraft, or just like

159
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:35,180
Loki, you want to hear more of his stuff. And this passion that clearly you have for

160
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:38,780
it where you know, you're you're and you're really taking this next level, please, please

161
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:44,420
check out Loki's YouTube, which is that it's a Loki olr is the username on there. I mean,

162
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:49,280
that's pretty much me on any socials just gonna be Loki olr. So I've got a couple episodes

163
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:55,420
out right now. I've got a third episode, almost done working on it right now. I'm guessing

164
00:12:55,420 --> 00:13:00,000
that this next episode with tango, maybe episode four or five, I haven't really decided yet

165
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,920
because there's gonna be a lot of prep work coming up to it. Got a lot of stuff I got

166
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:09,720
clean up. So there may be an episode in between there. So it's gonna be a four or five, it's

167
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:13,340
gonna be so yeah, I got a peek already at Episode five.

168
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:17,280
Watch it out. Loki make make his appearance like four episodes. Trust me.

169
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:21,120
I can't. Well, we'll see. We'll work it in there.

170
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:25,120
Or this is the foot in the door to get other content creators. And maybe they're not as

171
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:28,380
and maybe they're not as big as individual.

172
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:33,460
So many like, yeah, outside of hermitcraft, there's so many people that would be fun to

173
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:38,560
play with. I'm really looking forward is like, I know, I mean, like, we've done like the

174
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:43,360
VOG network servers and stuff, and that's fine. And it was fun playing with you guys.

175
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:48,880
But like, it's hard to and even with like the people that I'm with now, it's hard to

176
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:54,100
find a group of people that can play on a regular basis and that that can dedicate time

177
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:59,540
to that. And I know when I joined the server, the the invite that was in the Minecraft forums

178
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:03,860
was that they were looking for content creators to come on and make content together. And

179
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:10,100
unfortunately, at this point, I'm like the only one doing that of the group, which is

180
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:14,020
fine. Like they're still really cool people. And like, it's fun to play with them. But

181
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:19,100
like, I wish it was more of that kind of content creation. There's there's other servers other

182
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:24,340
than hermitcraft. Like I want to say, well, epic SMP for a little bit. But that's another

183
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:28,620
example. Also, big YouTubers, big Twitch streamers went together, played Minecraft, and that

184
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:33,660
died off really fast because people lost interest and went to other things. So it's just, I

185
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:38,540
want somebody to like, want a group that will be dedicated to a long period of time playing

186
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:44,260
this game at a level like where I'm at now and being able to collaborate and stuff more

187
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:48,900
of that because I don't really do a lot of the voice chat with these folks. And it's

188
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:53,120
just hard to it's hard to record too, because I'm in my kitchen. And like, honestly, like,

189
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:57,380
I really need a dedicated room because I, it's hard recording all the voiceovers after

190
00:14:57,380 --> 00:15:02,220
the fact. And it would just be so much easier with just the editing process to do all live

191
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:07,340
in from the get go. But I have to do what I can do within, you know, my limits. So

192
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:12,820
Well, I think a lot of folks in the chat, like, like, they feel the enthusiasm. And

193
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:16,460
I'm sure our podcast listeners, you know, even if it's like, Oh, I don't really follow

194
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:20,100
Minecraft at all, you can feel the enthusiasm coming off your voice. So I know there's going

195
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:23,260
to be a good video because you're obviously going to be putting like a lot of, you know,

196
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:26,520
and all your videos are good because you put in this type of passion into it. But this

197
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:29,740
particular one, especially because you can kind of hear that, you know, this could be

198
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:32,940
like a jumping point for then, you know, maybe you get to collaborate with some other

199
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:36,380
small and mid level content creators, which is great that they're looking for something

200
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:39,980
that you're looking for. So this is great. I'm excited for you. I'm really excited for

201
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:45,500
you. Congratulations. Thank you. If I may make a tiny suggestion, of course, what some

202
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:53,100
people do for recording is they'll have like tall, like plywood and do a mini booth where

203
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:59,400
you line it with the the sound dampening foam. And then that way, when you're ready to record,

204
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:05,320
you just bust it out for those moments. Well, right. I get that it's not the audio quality

205
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:09,920
that I'm worried about. It's the I'm in a kitchen with my children and my cat screaming

206
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:14,440
and they have like that. That's what I'm talking about. Like, I just need another room in the

207
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:21,520
house, which we don't have. We don't we have a bathroom one that will not work. I need

208
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:24,880
I need to build in a garage. Are you on a laptop? Because you could come use the oil

209
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:29,520
or you could use Studio N seven. We're vaccinated. I'm on a laptop. But like, think about it.

210
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:33,080
It's I just need to build a room in the garage. It really that's what it comes down to. But

211
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:37,400
that that's the hard part. It's like I even like trying to record voiceovers. I was trying

212
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:42,820
to do that yesterday. And the cat, even though she has no sense of hearing, she has a sense

213
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:48,400
of timing where she just knows that I'm doing a video conference or something. It's like

214
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:52,720
comes in, starts screaming. I'm like, great. Thank you for writing my voice over. It's

215
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:57,440
like, I don't know. All right. Well, fingers, fingers crossed. But this this also begs another

216
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:00,960
question. Okay, so so here we are in 2021. And I noticed there's there's there's lots

217
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:06,060
of community things happening. So Loki, obviously, really, you know, starting to jumpstart these

218
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:10,760
things he's doing with the Minecraft community and getting very involved with that dark Sakura.

219
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:15,600
I can't watch a Dead by Daylight streamer on Twitch without running into you and chat

220
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:20,340
anymore. And you obviously doing a lot more streaming yourself and getting to know a lot

221
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:24,120
of those people in that community. And I think making a name for yourself in the Dead

222
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:29,860
by Daylight community. It just came out this week. VOG Network's own Bobby Blackwolf has

223
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:34,180
been involved with the speedrunning community and doing awesome Games Done Quick and Summer

224
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:38,360
Games Done Quick is coming up. And did you all know VOG Network's own Bobby Blackwolf

225
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:41,740
is going to be doing the finale at Summer Games Done Quick this year. It's going to

226
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:46,620
be is going to be hosting the Kingdom Hearts 2. And yes, it's not it's not about the host.

227
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:51,740
It's about the charity. It's about the speedrunners. But I still think that's so cool. You know,

228
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:57,060
like just even be like, just to even be like affiliated with that or whatever is just so

229
00:17:57,060 --> 00:18:07,820
cool. What do I have? You guys have been streaming a lot of stuff. You and Alan. I mean, Alan.

230
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:15,120
Yes. Alan has a lot of stuff too. What do I have? Rob? Oh, that's right. OK. Pixel

231
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:21,480
Pacas reminded me I won a fake survivor game two years ago. That is right. When the Resident

232
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:28,600
Evil chapter comes out. Yeah. I said that that would pop my survivor cherry. Mm hmm.

233
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:34,880
So I have to do a swift with you and Alan. OK. OK. I'm so down for that. I was doing

234
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:39,620
a swift without which means survive with friends. I was doing that with Alan the other night

235
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:45,100
and we had a good time. Yeah. I think playing together were also I'm a higher rank survivor

236
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:49,980
than him. And I don't know how that happened. I really don't. I should. I just don't think

237
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:55,940
I'm going to suck at Survivor because I'm not altruistic. See it to be in chat says,

238
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:58,900
girl, you're amazing. Just the way you are. Thank you so much. No, I swear I wasn't fishing

239
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:03,580
for compliments. It was just a really funny opportunity for me to crack a joke. I have

240
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:07,340
the Dragon Con panel stuff coming up. And, you know, as conventions come back, I'll do

241
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:11,580
more and more of that panel hosting stuff. Live hosting is a thing I'm super into. So,

242
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:16,100
you know, I'm teasing. But there are some things I'm into that I'm thrilled to be affiliated

243
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:20,540
with. And honestly, I am giving some thought. I don't know if I should vocalize this on

244
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:24,460
O.L.R. because if I do it, I'm committed to it. But I'm really giving a thought on dipping

245
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:32,300
my toe back into really embracing retro games and doing more with retro stuff and NES classics

246
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:36,560
that I grew up with. If any of you have followed my personal YouTube channel, then like five,

247
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:43,240
six years ago, God, probably longer, I had started this concept of, you know, let's remember

248
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:47,440
where I would play some old games and really not just like kind of talk, but really like

249
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:51,280
do a deep dive into like memories with these old games. And, you know, a little different

250
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:54,600
from like, you know, classic game or anything else is that it's like I'm experiencing the

251
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:58,200
game while kind of relishing in some of the memories of the game. And I'm really thinking

252
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:03,500
about maybe bringing that back actually as like maybe a VOG project. I don't know. Maybe

253
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:07,860
personal channel, maybe VOG. I don't know. I haven't decided yet. But yeah. So that might

254
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:14,100
be it. Maybe I'll get in more with the retro community. We'll see. We'll see. So. All right.

255
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:19,060
SSJ100Matt in chat says it's been a year plus for a lot of folks. Finding that inspiration

256
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:24,420
is harder or easier for some folk and of course, differently. You do you. Yeah. I think that's

257
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:29,540
very good advice. It really is. Okay. So that was a long intro. We still haven't even gotten

258
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:32,900
to our kickoff topic. But no, that was we needed that update from Loki. That's really

259
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:38,320
exciting news. Let's talk about some of the news we missed last week. So we weren't here

260
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:45,620
last week, obviously. And we missed some news. Although with E3 and Summer Game Fest and

261
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:50,700
all that coming up in this next week, obviously the news has been a little bit light, not

262
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:54,260
just last week, but this week as well, just because a lot of the big announcements. Next

263
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:58,580
week's show will be huge because we're going to have a fun show tonight, too. But next

264
00:20:58,580 --> 00:21:03,980
week's show, especially because, you know, the Xbox Bethesda big event is in the morning.

265
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:08,320
For years and years here at OLR, we've had to go up against Bethesda during E3. They're

266
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:12,220
at the same time. But now that they're part of Microsoft, they're going in Microsoft spot.

267
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:15,260
So they're going to have a big event earlier in the day. So we'll have a lot to talk about

268
00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:21,740
on next week's show. In the last week, so before the week we were off, we did miss a

269
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:26,340
few big things. And I want to talk about some of those. So one of them was the Dragon Quest

270
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:30,900
35th anniversary stream. Did anyone catch some of the headlines or some of the key stuff

271
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:34,900
from this stream? Because there's some good stuff that came out of this, such as confirmation

272
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:40,220
that Dragon Quest 12 is coming. It's called The Flames of Fate. And I believe I believe

273
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:43,980
the way they phrased it was that it's going to be a fabulous flames of hate. No, it's

274
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:51,100
not the fabulous flames of hate, but it's it's it's a more adult version of Dragon Quest,

275
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:54,620
apparently, which is an interesting way. And I wonder if that's sort of a thing where it's

276
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:58,860
like, well, you know, a lot of you have kind of grown up with this series. It also kind

277
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:03,940
of made me think of like Yakuza like a dragon, where like growing up with Dragon Quest has

278
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:08,500
been it was has been a sort of a plot device. So not that I'm saying that Dragon Quest 12

279
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:13,140
is going to be like Yakuza, but I can't help but feel like maybe some of the creative direction

280
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:19,220
to kind of make it a more adult series is because of Dragon Quest influence in mainstream

281
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:27,140
as well as gaming culture. I think it could be interesting. So and Mike Deft in chat,

282
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:31,820
who's gone through a rebrand recently, it appears, says it's going to be a more dark

283
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:37,420
adult Dragon Quest. I'm OK. You know what? Dragon Quest has had a very cartoony look

284
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:41,940
for a long time, and I realize that's a hallmark of the franchise, but I'm OK with them going

285
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:45,100
a little bit of a darker direction with it. I think that could be interesting. I just

286
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:52,540
hope they get a new composer. And let's see, what else do we have a Dragon Quest? Oh, yes.

287
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:58,300
Dragon Quest three is getting an HD remake and it looks really good to 2D remake and

288
00:22:58,300 --> 00:23:02,980
it looks really good. And that is a lot of people going, why can't they do this to the

289
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:08,020
Final Fantasy or Chrono Trigger series as well? Hey, well, you know what? If this sells

290
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:13,020
really well, I bet they'll consider it. So, I mean, you know, if this is at all interesting

291
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:16,860
to you, you might want to buy it. Yuji Horii apparently considering giving Dragon Quest

292
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:21,620
one and two the same treatment. So fingers and toes crossed on that. There were some

293
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:25,100
other things announced. I think the other big thing for me, I'm not going to talk about

294
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:30,940
everything they said in that, but I think for me, Dragon Quest 10 offline was announced.

295
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:34,700
So Dragon Quest 10 has been an MMO. It's been online, right? And I think they're getting

296
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:40,240
a new version six expansion even. It's still going. But we have yet to experience it in

297
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:45,900
America. And I don't they didn't say the Dragon Quest 10 offline is coming to America.

298
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:51,160
But in my head, I'm like, that's how they're going to do it. They get this game out and

299
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:55,420
they can localize it. And that's how we'll get Dragon Quest 10 here in America. I think

300
00:23:55,420 --> 00:24:00,720
I'm jumping to conclusions a little bit. But the news of a Dragon Quest 10 offline coming

301
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:06,640
is pretty exciting, I think. So we'll see. Any interest from you guys in playing offline

302
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:10,160
version of Dragon Quest? I mean, I'd love to play the online one, but I think the reality

303
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:16,600
is, is never going to be localized or available to come out here. I'm not really a Dragon

304
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:22,800
Quest fan, so probably not. I haven't played Dragon Quest since Dragon Quest. We you should

305
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:28,200
check out. Eleven isn't bad, but, you know, it had it had some things that, you know,

306
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:31,960
but I think this direction they're going with with twelve will be a great thing for the

307
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:36,580
series. They did announce what platforms twelve is going to be on, though, which was interesting.

308
00:24:36,580 --> 00:24:40,860
Usually they tell us pretty early, so we don't know if it's a Switch game, PlayStation 5

309
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:46,500
game or what or an Xbox game. You know, we don't know. So stay tuned for more information

310
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:50,820
on that, I suppose. So let's see. So other news that we missed last week. The Dragon

311
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:56,740
Quest announcement was the big one. Sonic also had a stream on May 27th, and they're

312
00:24:56,740 --> 00:25:02,100
going to be doing like an orchestral, orchestral Sonic performance during Summer Game Fest.

313
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:06,900
I think that's coming up in the next few days when there's a compilation called Sonic

314
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:12,540
Origins that's going to be coming to the more current systems. Sega loves to put their retro

315
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:16,340
stuff, especially Sonic, on consoles every single time. So this really shouldn't be a

316
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:23,420
surprise, but it'll be nice. Olympic Games Tokyo 2020, the official video game, got a

317
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:29,100
new Sonic the Hedgehog costume. So it looks so ridiculous. The game for the Olympics that

318
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:32,940
didn't happen when they were supposed to happen. And it says this is the official Olympics

319
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:36,580
games, not like Mario and Sonic at the Olympics. So that's why it's ridiculous. Yes, that's

320
00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:41,360
why it's ridiculous. And then obviously the big thing that had everybody talking, a teaser

321
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:47,020
for a new mainline Sonic game. No title. We know it's 2022. We know it's going to be on

322
00:25:47,020 --> 00:25:51,940
the Switch, but that's about all we know as of right now. So we're just kind of fingers

323
00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:56,980
and toes crossed. It's a little more. Where was it? Sonic Mania and a little less Sonic

324
00:25:56,980 --> 00:26:02,980
the Hedgehog part? Well, the mix of the update for Sonic Colors. So Sonic Colors Ultimate

325
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:07,460
was something else. OK. Oh, I think I missed that in the list. Thank you. So, yeah, because

326
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:12,300
I did watch this, actually, because I caught it like it happened in the pop up on my YouTube

327
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:19,740
feed. But it yeah, it's interesting. Just the new Sonic game they tease like, you know,

328
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:24,220
sounded interesting. Sonic Colors I never really played because that was I think that

329
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:31,460
was a Wii U game. I can't remember, but it looks good. You know, good remaster, I guess.

330
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:36,580
Some other announcements from the week we were off. There is a Kunio-kun, which of course

331
00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:40,660
you might know as like the River City Ransom, Super Dodgeball type of games that's going

332
00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:46,060
to be doing a 35th anniversary project. So then those those games, they kind of re-release

333
00:26:46,060 --> 00:26:49,740
not that long ago as well. So it's nice to see that there's still a lot of love for that

334
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:56,980
series. Super Bomberman Online Cross Fall Guys can be a crossover going on there. Shiva

335
00:26:56,980 --> 00:27:04,620
will be joining Streets of Rage 4 in the Mr. X Nightmare DLC. And probably the other biggest,

336
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:09,960
biggest headline from last week when we were off, no BlizzCon this year. Blizzard announced

337
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:14,820
they're not going to be doing a BlizzCon this year, which is in contrast to some other.

338
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:18,780
I mean, I don't know if this is because BlizzCon is in California, which has been a little

339
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:24,220
slower to reopen, but some other conventions in this same week, such as DragonCon, have

340
00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:28,060
announced that they're essentially going, I don't want to say full steam ahead with

341
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:34,060
the convention, but that in-person is part of their plan. I sort of have the gut feeling

342
00:27:34,060 --> 00:27:37,140
they're going to, it's, it'll still be kind of a different DragonCon and they're probably

343
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:41,420
expecting less people because there will, they are still pouring everything into having

344
00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:46,700
a virtual component as well. So people will have the choice between the two. I caught

345
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:54,580
in chat earlier, MagFest confirmed they're coming back in person January 2022. But Blizzard

346
00:27:54,580 --> 00:28:01,420
has decided not for them this year. So they're going to be doing an online event instead.

347
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:06,980
And executive producer of BlizzCon in a statement, Sarah Lynn Smith said, the ongoing complexities

348
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:11,060
and uncertainties of the pandemic have impacted our ability to properly move forward on any

349
00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:15,460
of these fronts. And ultimately we're now past the point where we'd be able to develop

350
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:20,100
the kind of event we'd want to create for you in November. That's an interesting perspective

351
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:27,100
too is that honestly, to do BlizzCon in November, that planning starts in like February or March.

352
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:32,260
It takes a long time to put on a BlizzCon. So I can understand for sure the perspective

353
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:38,920
of they don't want to do all this planning and then, oh shit, September, October, a variant

354
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:43,460
is loose or something. I mean, I hope it doesn't happen, but we have to be prepared mentally

355
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:47,620
that might. And then they just got to shut down BlizzCon all over again. And I can sort

356
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:53,820
of see where maybe they also just don't have a lot to say because they've already had to

357
00:28:53,820 --> 00:29:00,100
kind of delay stuff, right? We know Diablo 4, not till next year. Overwatch 2, not till

358
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:07,300
next year. Diablo 2, we get this year. But we had a virtual BlizzCon, what, March? Which

359
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:12,220
was kind of delayed from last November. So maybe they're just not ready. But they will

360
00:29:12,220 --> 00:29:18,500
be doing a virtual BlizzCon line instead. They're also talking about smaller in-person

361
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:22,500
gatherings and that's kind of interesting too. That maybe they'll have like satellite

362
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:29,340
meetups and stuff like that. But keep an eye on that. So no BlizzCon 2021, but a BlizzCon

363
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:35,660
line sounds like it'll be a thing. SSG100Matt in chat says, kind of wish they pushed Magfest

364
00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:41,200
to February again because everyone liked February Mag. Yeah, consider me one of those people.

365
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:47,960
But I don't know if realistically January Magfest can be in the cards for me. I don't

366
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:53,800
want to rule it out yet, but there's a lot going on personally where I don't think it's

367
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:57,240
going to be a great idea for me. And when I can tell you more about what's going on,

368
00:29:57,240 --> 00:30:02,560
I think you'll understand. But I hope MagWest comes back next summer because I'd like to

369
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:08,800
go to that for a change. That'd be nice. So, all right. Let's move on. We've talked about

370
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:13,520
what happened last week in gaming. Let's talk a little bit about the next week before

371
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:17,920
we get into our gaming weeks. We've kind of mentioned a couple of times now, but just

372
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:23,640
another reminder, it's E3 week coming up. And this year we also have Summer Game Fest

373
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:28,040
happening at the same time. So you have kind of two big events happening and that means

374
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:34,120
all these other smaller events that are going on for really the summer. Here's some things

375
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:38,480
to look forward to in the coming weeks. The official Battlefield reveal. I think we'll

376
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:42,160
be talking a little bit more about this later in the show, but I'll just say quickly, more

377
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:48,640
information on the next Battlefield game June 9th or Wednesday. That's at 7 o'clock Pacific

378
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:57,360
time. Summer Game Fest, 11 a.m. Pacific time and that would be 2 p.m. Eastern time on Thursday.

379
00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:02,240
This will be Geoff Keighley's event. So the people that brought you the game awards. Weezer

380
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:06,280
is going to be playing for whatever reason. But yeah, that's cool. Weezer's cool. Whatever.

381
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:12,320
Awesome. Folks like the studio behind Among Us will be unveiling something. Could that

382
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:16,960
be a new map? Could that be a new game? Don't know. We'll see. But check that out. That

383
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:22,600
will all be on Thursday. Also, another Geoff Keighley event as part of Summer Games Fest

384
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:29,660
will be on Friday at 9 a.m. Pacific, noon. This is a Geoff Keighley and Netflix collaboration.

385
00:31:29,660 --> 00:31:34,040
And as you guys know, Netflix has really been dipping their toe into gaming, right? The

386
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:37,920
Witcher does well and that which technically the Witcher was a book. But I think we all

387
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:42,260
know the look at this. Obviously, the fact that it was a game really propelled it to

388
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:47,280
being a series. And so now Netflix between that and the Castlevania anime doing like

389
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:53,400
Netflix is like full on fucking gaming media now, like all these, which is great. Have

390
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:59,040
you seen the brand new trailer? Like I'm not a huge fan of Dynasty Wars, but that trailer?

391
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:06,800
No, I didn't. It's a live action like it's a live action Dynasty Warriors. And it's it's

392
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:11,680
amazing. It takes me back to when I used to go to Fanime and watch all the late night

393
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:17,720
like Kung Fu, Hong Kong cinema stuff. Wow. Oh, my God. It's so amazing. Like I need to

394
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:22,460
watch that. OK, check this out. This is what this is. What's on the list for them to talk

395
00:32:22,460 --> 00:32:27,960
about at this Netflix event on Friday? Cyberpunk 2077 because there's that Edgerunners anime

396
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:34,560
is having Tomb Raider, Assassin's Creed, Devil May Cry, Dota 2, League of Legends,

397
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:39,740
Beyond Good and Evil, Dragon's Dogma, Sonic the Hedgehog, which I don't think that's related

398
00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:42,920
to the movie, but I guess there must be a series I completely forgot about or anime

399
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:47,160
or something. It was part of the it was part of the Sonic event that they talked about.

400
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:53,560
They're doing a new series. It's about it's based on colors or the Sonic Color stuff.

401
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:59,000
Well, there you go. That's a lot. That's a lot of media based on video games. And they're

402
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:03,660
saying more and more, probably some new announcements out of this as well. The things we don't even

403
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:08,680
know about yet. Come on, Tron. Come on, Tron. I guess I guess Tron was really a movie before

404
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:12,840
it was a game, but they could put it in there and get away with it. Right. Also, Tron would

405
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:17,560
really be Disney Plus. So I'm really rooting for the wrong thing. I just love Tron so much.

406
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:22,760
OK, they had an awesome anime Tron series and they did. They canceled it like they kept

407
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:29,720
my movies. Maybe. OK. All right. You really want to get tin foil hat? You really? OK,

408
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:34,760
here we go. Making my predictions. Subscribe to my YouTube channel. Here we go. How about

409
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:44,200
that long, long rumored Zelda series for Netflix? Wouldn't that be the flack on the table for

410
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:52,680
all of E3? That's just like that. That's so like IGN April Fool's Day content right there.

411
00:33:52,840 --> 00:34:00,280
Like I've already been disappointed too many times with that. Like, I don't. Yeah, we'll see.

412
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:05,960
S2 and Hunter Mountain chat says Half-Life three, the movie. Hey, hey. Might as well. We're throwing

413
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:09,960
out all these impossible things. Sure. Why not? Why not? Why not? All right. The movie.

414
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:14,520
Getting into some other stuff. OK, so then E3 star. Oh, actually, I want to shout out the

415
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:18,360
wholesome direct because I think that's really adorable and it's an indie thing. We love our

416
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:23,720
indies. That is on Saturday at 10 a.m. Pacific. I have to do math in my head. 1 p.m. Eastern.

417
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:30,280
That is at Wholesome Games dot com. Seventy five feel good indie games. That's if you want to wrap

418
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:35,960
yourself up in indie games and give yourself a hug. Wholesome Direct on Saturday. Ubisoft

419
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:42,360
11 a.m. on Saturday. Don't know exactly what they'll be talking about. I guess Trackmania

420
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:48,040
and surely some new games in their other franchises as well. I'm sorry. The pre-show

421
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:56,600
is at 11. The show show is at noon. So there's there's two Ubisoft shows. So Devolver Digital

422
00:34:56,600 --> 00:35:04,280
will be doing things on Saturday at 1 30 Pacific, 4 30 Eastern Devolver Digital. They they're crazy

423
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:09,960
and in a good way. And I think there'll be a lot of fun to watch there. Their E3 thing last year

424
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:16,200
was the best thing that like first person exploring thing that they did. Did you guys

425
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:19,960
already forget about that? That game they released on Steam that was like their E3. That was the best

426
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:26,440
thing ever. That was awesome. Gearbox is doing something on Saturday, but we don't know when.

427
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:31,240
We do know that there were those little teasers from the Borderlands movie. So I don't know if

428
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:36,040
maybe something's crossing over there, but we saw the very shadowy figures of the actors in their

429
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:44,760
costumes. So, hmm, hmm. Sunday, 10 a.m. Pacific, 1 p.m. Eastern, Xbox and Bethesda. That's going

430
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:51,880
to be a big one. I'm very excited for that. I'm hoping we can simulcast it here at VOG

431
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:57,160
that they will allow us to do a co-stream. If so, I will be on there and whoever. I'm sure Bobby

432
00:35:57,160 --> 00:36:01,160
will join me and Loki and Dark Soccer are more than welcome if they want to do some running

433
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:06,920
commentary with that. That's if we are allowed to co-stream. If they do not give express permission

434
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:11,960
for that, then we'll just be in chat and host it and give our reactions that way. So that'll be fun.

435
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:18,200
The PC gaming show. This show has been kind of garbage. I'm going to be honest, not usually a

436
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:23,000
lot to look forward to. Will this be the year they change it around? Maybe 11 a.m. Pacific,

437
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:30,120
2 p.m. Eastern. Loki, am I right? The PC thing is usually kind of stupid. I'm sorry, but they need

438
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:35,880
to kick it up a notch. Square Enix ought to be a little more exciting and that will be it. This is

439
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:44,440
an odd time. 1215 Pacific, 315 Eastern on Sunday as well. So that's kind of cool. And then that's

440
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:50,520
it for the big ones on Sunday. And then let's see. Oh no, I'm sorry. Warner Brothers still is TBA,

441
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:55,240
so they might do something. I don't know. Limited Run Games. So I'm sure they're going to put

442
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:59,240
together some more cartridges you have to own. That is going to be at one o'clock Pacific,

443
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:05,080
four o'clock Eastern on Monday. Take Two is going to do something on Monday. Capcom is doing

444
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:11,320
something on Monday. And then we get to Tuesday, the Nintendo Direct. This is going to be one for

445
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:18,520
the ages. Hopefully we're not hyping it up too much, but I hope this is it. Tuesday 9 a.m. Pacific.

446
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:26,120
All of the Pikmin games. All of them. Like Pikmin, they're going to have Pikmin 5 through 20. It's

447
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:31,880
just going to be one afternoon. Pikmin, Pikmin, Pikmin. I think they really and I, you know,

448
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:37,560
I don't like to set the bar. They they have to update us on Breath of the Wild 2. Like they

449
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:44,360
have to. I'm sorry. Prime 4 and all the other games that they've teased. You know what? The

450
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:49,640
Zelda one is more important, in my opinion. Like the Zelda one, they have to update people on that.

451
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:54,920
If at least they do that, I think they can get away without saying Bayonetta 3 for another

452
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:59,320
Direct. But I think there's a huge expectation. We've got to get an update on Breath of the Wild

453
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:04,440
2. And I fully understand we might not get it, but there's that. I'll come out on the next console.

454
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:11,320
Now Bobby is also saying, note the Nintendo Direct is just about software. That's a good reminder.

455
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:16,840
In their tweet, they said software only. And all these things that said Switch Pro, it's going to

456
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:20,280
be revealed Thursday. No, no, no. It's going to be revealed Friday. Well, guess what? It still

457
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:25,800
ain't fucking here. So this is a big red flag that maybe Nintendo is not doing the Switch Pro

458
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:32,520
this year. And I think we all need to maybe and you know what, Loki? I think we have to give them

459
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:36,600
credit if they made this decision. Maybe they realized they weren't going to be able to make

460
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:40,680
enough of them because of all these hardware shortages. And so they've decided not to try

461
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:46,520
this year. You assume they learned something. They didn't learn anything. They're just good.

462
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:50,760
They'll still announce it. It'll be like so far in the future. And they still won't have it could

463
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:56,120
be a perfect world where we have we're literally drowning in silicon. And they would still find

464
00:38:56,120 --> 00:39:02,600
some way to short that thing. Like I don't buy for one second, that no matter when they announce it,

465
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:07,560
that there won't be shortages. And they will be completely incompetent with their, you know,

466
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:13,480
retail flow or whatever. I just, whatever. Um, Bobby Blackwood and chat says, so let me ask

467
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:20,040
this. Why do we need an update on Breath of the Wild 2? It's been a long time. And I know you're

468
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:24,360
not going to accept that answer because Nintendo can really put this out whenever they want and

469
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:32,280
people will eat it up. But I think to an extent, the Zelda fan base is very loyal. It's very large.

470
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:38,680
Breath of the Wild really propelled the Switch to its early success. Even though it was a Wii U game,

471
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:46,520
it really made its case for the Switch very well. And I almost think to go this long without giving

472
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:52,120
the fans even a peek at what's going on, I think is starting to insult the fan base. I'm going to

473
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:58,200
just be very clear. And I know that answer is going to be controversial. But I think with things

474
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:03,640
having gone on this long to not even give a peek or an update or a hint of what's going on or what

475
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:08,680
to expect or what the game's going to look like or what I think it's just insulting at this point

476
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:13,320
if we go past, uh, another year. Cause when did they, I don't, I can't even remember when they

477
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:22,120
did the first reveal. Was it the games, uh, awards 2018 or something like that? I don't know. Anyway.

478
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:26,760
Um, Bobby and chat says, I've never heard of someone not buying a game because they didn't

479
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:33,160
get an update at a specific time. Again, I, I understand that at the end of the day,

480
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:35,960
they're going to release the game. They could just say, Oh, it's out tomorrow,

481
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:41,320
thwack. And it'll still sell pretty good, but will it sell breath of the wild good

482
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:50,120
or will it sell skyward sword? Good. I don't know. Anyway. All right. But there is something

483
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:52,920
you're underestimating though. Bobby who says I would have bought breath of the wild too,

484
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:56,920
when it came out, but since they didn't give us any info at E3 2020, I'm not pre-orders

485
00:40:56,920 --> 00:41:03,960
and the industry puts a lot of stock in that. So anyway, I'm going to move on. Uh,

486
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:08,920
what was, uh, let's see. I want to see if there's anything else on this. Usually

487
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:14,520
Nintendo is kind of the end of like the big E3 week, but I guess Bandai Namco

488
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:19,480
is also doing something on Tuesday. We just don't know what time, uh, Elden Ring is still

489
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:23,880
sort of that it's hanging out there. We don't really know like what's going on with that.

490
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:31,960
Who knows? Um, there is a Steam Next Fest starting on Wednesday. So Valve doing a virtual

491
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:36,040
festival that will have demos and things like that within the Steam store, who knows if they'll

492
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:40,440
be doing anything themselves within Steam that is on the 16th. As we start to get further and

493
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:45,320
further out, we get to Wednesday, the 23rd of June, where the Sonic Symphony Orchestra

494
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:50,040
that before, uh, mentioned Sonic stream earlier in the show that is actually happening on June 23rd.

495
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:55,480
The Microsoft Windows reveal is happening on June 24th. And then, uh, of course,

496
00:41:55,480 --> 00:42:01,800
Summer Games Done Quick starts on the 4th of July and, uh, let's see, what else do we have way out?

497
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:08,680
OEA Play is, uh, July 22nd. So lots and lots to look forward to throughout the summer,

498
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:13,160
but it's going to be a busy week next week. Uh, and especially as we get into the week after that

499
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:17,400
as well. So we're going to finally be talking about a lot of new games, uh, in the coming weeks

500
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:22,280
here at OLR. But for now, let's talk about the games that we have been playing this past week,

501
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:25,960
uh, or I suppose two weeks if you want, in the segment called How Is Your Gaming Week?

502
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:31,400
Let's go to Dark Sakura. I have been playing a lot of Dead by Daylight. I'm trying to get better,

503
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:38,200
and I'm trying to get that face thing for Plague at the end of, uh, the third, uh,

504
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:47,240
whatever the tome thing is. Oh, yeah. Yeah. The Rift. Yeah. The Rift. Um,

505
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:53,400
and I've, of course, been playing Fantasian, um, really enjoying Fantasian, just trying to

506
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:59,320
explore and take my time with it while, you know, I've got folks watching. Um,

507
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:07,800
I've been playing Wardscape still, um, um, playing Animal Crossing. Um, so those are all my usuals.

508
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:17,560
Um, I did, I'm actually going to be trying down the line some, uh, uh, Mario 64 ROM hacks. I

509
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:21,800
haven't decided which one I want to start with, but those are going to be coming up as soon as I

510
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:28,040
can get something that will work on my Mac. Nice. Oh, and Guns N' Roses Pinball.

511
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:36,200
Of course, Pinball. Of course, Pinball. All right. Um, let's move on. Uh, Loki,

512
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:40,200
how was your gaming week? Um, my gaming week was, like I said, you know,

513
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:46,600
it's pretty much been Minecraft. I did play occasionally some Orna when I go places. Um,

514
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:52,280
but that's pretty much it. It's just been, just been Minecraft. You've really been pouring a lot

515
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:59,480
into Minecraft, huh? Yes. I, this week. So like I built my shop in our shopping district, which is

516
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:05,320
enormous. So they'll be in the next video. And there was a, another community challenge was the

517
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:11,160
one chunk build challenge. So I built a giant redstone rollercoaster in that. And so it's

518
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:16,840
incredibly elaborate, um, also in the video. So, um, that'll be coming soon. You can see

519
00:44:16,840 --> 00:44:24,520
all the stuff I worked on this week. All right. Uh, let's see my gaming week. Um,

520
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:29,160
I, a lot of the same stuff, honestly, still been going in dead by daylight myself. Um,

521
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:33,800
uh, got my survivor up to rank eight. So I feel like I'm, which is weird because I don't have all

522
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:40,120
the talents you really need, but, um, I've gotten pretty good at hunting totems and, uh, for better

523
00:44:40,120 --> 00:44:43,400
for worse, when haunted ground is in play for those that play the game. Uh, and I'm getting

524
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:47,800
really good at evading. Uh, I'm sorry, not like looping. When I get in the chase with the killer,

525
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:53,080
I kinda start to flop. I need to get better at looping killers. Although, uh, at the killer

526
00:44:53,080 --> 00:44:56,840
shack, I'm getting better because that's like the easiest place to loop a killer. So I'm getting

527
00:44:56,840 --> 00:45:01,640
better at looping a killer shack. Um, and if you don't know what all this stuff means, uh, watch

528
00:45:01,640 --> 00:45:06,120
one of dark Sakura streams or, or one of the many people that streamed dead by daylight here, um,

529
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:10,040
or one of these days I'll finally freaking stream, uh, Alan alchemy. Of course, my husband does a lot

530
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:16,200
of great streams too with a dead by daylight. Um, but, uh, um, I'm getting a little better with

531
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:20,760
that, but I'm pretty good at being stealth in the first place and just not getting caught by the

532
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:25,880
killer. Um, however, you don't get a lot of points by doing that. And I wish, I wish the game did

533
00:45:25,880 --> 00:45:30,520
reward stealth play a little more. Um, but you really have to be like willing to rescue people

534
00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:36,440
from hooks and be what they call altruistic in the game, um, to, uh, really, uh, up your, um,

535
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:41,320
points. So I've been playing that. Um, I've also been playing, of course, Final Fantasy 14 still,

536
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:46,520
I did Pokemon go community day today. There was a huge Pokemon go community day today. It was gibble,

537
00:45:46,520 --> 00:45:50,600
which is one that the fans, you know, it's a pretty rare to spawn Pokemon. And I think this

538
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:55,400
is one that the fans have been requesting for some time. So I think this was a good time with, um,

539
00:45:55,400 --> 00:45:59,800
you know, COVID restrictions starting to ease and of course outdoor activity is, you know,

540
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:06,360
really safe, you know, uh, at least if you listen to the CDC, um, this was a great day to do that,

541
00:46:06,360 --> 00:46:11,800
uh, to kind of like welcome people back to Pokemon go. Um, I caught 10 shinies in like 90 minutes and

542
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:16,360
that was enough for me. I already had two shiny gibles. So I was a little sad that those got

543
00:46:16,360 --> 00:46:21,080
devalued, but that's all right. Uh, I caught 10 more shinies and decided to call it a day,

544
00:46:21,080 --> 00:46:27,320
by the way, if you want to know, Oh yes. And I think, uh, yeah. Uh, Mike Defton chat says

545
00:46:27,320 --> 00:46:33,240
I went all Shane and got 42. Oh, y'all want to hear the text message from Shane? Hold on. I got

546
00:46:33,240 --> 00:46:42,040
it. Ended at 59. I wanted one more so you can have a nice round number. I suppose 59 shinies.

547
00:46:42,040 --> 00:46:47,160
That guy caught, wow. Uh, I was fine with 10. That was, that was enough for me. I don't know what I

548
00:46:47,160 --> 00:46:52,760
would do at 59 shinies. So, all right. Uh, but gibble, I do love the shiny gibble. And remember

549
00:46:52,760 --> 00:46:57,480
for those that know, Shane, the shiny gibble is blue, which is also, you know, another.

550
00:46:57,480 --> 00:47:02,760
Oh, well that says it all right there. Exactly. Right. Exactly. Exactly. So there's that. Um,

551
00:47:04,040 --> 00:47:08,840
and, uh, I played a little more mass effect, legendary edition, which I know I, uh, popped

552
00:47:08,840 --> 00:47:14,920
off as the kids say a couple of weeks ago. Um, but since we had the end of May and the last,

553
00:47:14,920 --> 00:47:20,440
you know, week, last two weeks, uh, I had about 70 gigs left in my bandwidth for the month.

554
00:47:20,440 --> 00:47:24,440
So I was like, all right, let me grab this mass effect, a legendary patch. You know,

555
00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:28,360
I was behind on my patches. So I had like, I don't know, 11 or 12 gigs to download.

556
00:47:28,360 --> 00:47:34,120
So I downloaded that patch and then continued my adventures in mass effect one. Um, and, um, yeah,

557
00:47:34,120 --> 00:47:37,480
I was having a, I was having a fine time with it, trying to grind some of the achievements and

558
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:43,560
things like that. And I, the mass effect one does play so much better. Like it's a great time to

559
00:47:44,120 --> 00:47:49,960
jump in and experience the trilogy. If you've never played before, I would still maybe give it

560
00:47:49,960 --> 00:47:54,600
another couple months just to make sure they're not going to do any more patches. Um, but I think

561
00:47:54,600 --> 00:48:02,120
this is a it's, it's getting there, I suppose. Um, so, uh, yeah. Um, what was I going to say

562
00:48:02,120 --> 00:48:07,080
with that? Uh, Oh yeah. Shane had texted me. Apparently there are still bugs. He sent me

563
00:48:07,080 --> 00:48:11,960
a video where he got his character stuck in the Citadel, uh, and was like bouncing around and

564
00:48:11,960 --> 00:48:16,920
stuff. So, uh, it's still got its issues, but I didn't find them for whatever it's worth. And I,

565
00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:21,640
I don't know if the average player will, but, uh, yeah. So I did, I did, I did play a little more

566
00:48:21,640 --> 00:48:26,520
mass effect legendary edition. Um, you know, since I had the bandwidth to download, um,

567
00:48:27,080 --> 00:48:31,080
uh, the patch, I don't know when I'll be able to start two and three since I cannot install from

568
00:48:31,080 --> 00:48:35,480
the disks. So we'll have to see how the bandwidth looks this month, but at least it's only a 30 day

569
00:48:35,480 --> 00:48:41,880
month. There's that. All right. Um, I guess that's that for my gaming week. So, um, I don't

570
00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:46,840
really have any other housekeeping or news of note, so I think we will get into, Oh, I guess

571
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:51,720
I should say for the housekeeping segment, uh, we are collecting channel points over at, uh, our

572
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:57,320
Twitch stream over at VOG network. Uh, and if we get enough points, which, uh, on the current

573
00:48:57,320 --> 00:49:03,400
trajectory, I think we will, uh, we are going to present a special stream, uh, for folks at VOG

574
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:09,400
network. It's going to be orange lounge radio episode one with commentary from myself,

575
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:15,080
dark Sakura and Loki. And that should be interesting because episode one, um, is probably

576
00:49:15,080 --> 00:49:19,960
not a great piece of media, but I think it's a great opportunity for us to really look at how

577
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:26,040
far we've come in the last 19 years and really talk about, you know, some of the stuff behind

578
00:49:26,040 --> 00:49:30,120
the formation of the show that maybe we haven't gotten into on the show before. I think it'd be

579
00:49:30,120 --> 00:49:36,040
a fun time to, uh, jump back, uh, and take a look. So tell, tell some stories to the children of the

580
00:49:36,040 --> 00:49:45,880
olden days. Right guys. All right. Anyhow, horror of me in my twenties. Oh God. Yeah.

581
00:49:46,520 --> 00:49:51,080
Hearing myself in my twenties is not something I'm looking forward to. Um, and I, I already know

582
00:49:51,080 --> 00:49:55,000
we're going to say something that's going to be like, Oh God, I wish I hadn't said that, or I

583
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:58,040
wouldn't have said that today. I know there's going to be something in there that's going to

584
00:49:58,040 --> 00:50:03,800
make me do that. But I think that's also part of, um, I think looking back, acknowledging that and

585
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:10,760
going, wow, I've grown since then, um, is, is a good thing. I do. So, uh, we'll do that. So, all

586
00:50:10,760 --> 00:50:16,040
right. Uh, let's move on. Let's get into, uh, this week in gaming news. And I believe we start off

587
00:50:16,040 --> 00:50:23,480
with Loki. Yeah. So we've got an announcement of a brand new mini console. Um, this is kind of

588
00:50:23,560 --> 00:50:29,960
similar to the one that Sega put out a while back. That was the Sega Astro city cabinet.

589
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:39,880
This one is a Taito egret too many, and it's full of different games, classic games, obviously.

590
00:50:39,880 --> 00:50:44,600
Um, they're going to have a 40 games in their total. They've only announced some of them so far,

591
00:50:45,160 --> 00:50:50,760
but of course, big names like space invaders, lunar rescue kicks, elevator action,

592
00:50:51,480 --> 00:50:58,440
bubble bobble, rainbow islands, extra New Zealand story. Um, they also have several different

593
00:50:59,080 --> 00:51:07,240
like controller setups that you can get as well. Um, which looked kind of cool and yeah,

594
00:51:07,240 --> 00:51:15,400
it's supposed to be priced at about 18,678 yen, which is about $170. And it's coming out next

595
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:23,800
year. So March 2nd, 2022 in Japan, obviously. All right. I, yeah, I did see the different,

596
00:51:23,800 --> 00:51:28,520
like, I want to say they had different like setups for like the actual control panel.

597
00:51:28,520 --> 00:51:37,720
So they even have like, say a, um, Oh, they called it the paddle and trackball games. So I

598
00:51:37,720 --> 00:51:41,240
don't know if they actually have a paddle and stuff in there, but, um, arcinoids in there as

599
00:51:41,240 --> 00:51:47,160
well and arcinoid returns. Um, but yeah, pretty cool lineup. Yeah. And I love the, the monitor

600
00:51:47,160 --> 00:51:55,560
thing is pretty cool. So yeah. Um, I, uh, I don't know how many arcade replicas I can fit in my

601
00:51:55,560 --> 00:52:01,720
house, but that does sound nice. Uh, especially, uh, you know, there's stuff coming up later,

602
00:52:01,720 --> 00:52:06,520
but, uh, arcade went up, but I mean, we all know that's a thing. Uh, dark soccer has got

603
00:52:06,520 --> 00:52:11,000
pinball machines to deal with as well. It's almost like there's too many big collectibles

604
00:52:11,240 --> 00:52:20,280
All right. Let's talk about some virtual things. Yeah. Never enough is the correct,

605
00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:25,560
uh, answer, I suppose. All right. Let's talk about things that are virtual in the game creating

606
00:52:25,560 --> 00:52:31,320
space. Facebook has made another purchase this week. Um, which, you know, man, I'm not a huge

607
00:52:31,320 --> 00:52:35,960
fan of Facebook, but this one at least makes a little bit of sense to me. I think even if you

608
00:52:35,960 --> 00:52:40,680
were kind of like, I don't understand why Facebook bought Oculus, even though I think that actually

609
00:52:40,680 --> 00:52:44,760
does make a lot of sense, but we're not going to retread that old ground tonight. Uh, this,

610
00:52:44,760 --> 00:52:51,400
this is an interesting one. So they've bought a game making platform called U well unit two games

611
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:57,640
is who they bought unit two games made something called Crayta. This is a collaborative game

612
00:52:57,640 --> 00:53:03,640
creating platform that was built on unreal engine four. It's actually in Google Stadia,

613
00:53:03,640 --> 00:53:08,760
uh, which I didn't realize at all. Maybe I didn't play around with Stadia enough. Uh, I doubt you've

614
00:53:08,760 --> 00:53:12,280
come across this. You're, you're kind of the Stadia fan in the house, dark soccer, but I doubt

615
00:53:12,280 --> 00:53:18,200
you've come across this yet. Oh, maybe you did. I don't know. I have it. Oh, have you, oh, have you

616
00:53:18,200 --> 00:53:22,520
played around with it at all? No, it was free. Oh, huh. Uh, I remember seeing some of like the

617
00:53:22,520 --> 00:53:26,600
previews and the trailers for it. So I thought it was interesting, but yeah, so it started as a

618
00:53:26,600 --> 00:53:31,880
Stadia, uh, exclusive, but now Facebook is going to be absorbing this team and now Facebook has a

619
00:53:31,880 --> 00:53:38,040
part of the technology. Uh, however, uh, in the FAQs that were posted about this acquisition,

620
00:53:38,040 --> 00:53:42,280
uh, this team is not going to stop working on Crayta. The game will still continue to be

621
00:53:42,280 --> 00:53:45,800
available. So don't think that, Oh, they're going to shut down the Stadia one and move it to

622
00:53:45,800 --> 00:53:49,720
Facebook or whatever it is. Although I imagine Facebook is going to be getting its own version

623
00:53:49,720 --> 00:53:55,960
of this, but Facebook has purchased the company to make game creation, more accessible and easy

624
00:53:55,960 --> 00:54:02,280
to use. And they're looking to integrate Crayta's creation tool set into Facebook gaming's cloud

625
00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:09,160
platform to instantly deliver new experiences via Facebook. Now, keep in mind in Crayta,

626
00:54:09,160 --> 00:54:13,880
you can make your own games, you know, it's, it's kind of limited coding, uh, whatever your comfort

627
00:54:13,880 --> 00:54:19,560
level is there. Uh, and then folks play the games and you can, they can actually earn money for,

628
00:54:19,560 --> 00:54:25,800
I'd say you can earn money when they play your games. Um, so that's kind of interesting. Uh,

629
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:29,160
is that maybe there's going to be a whole little money-making thing there that Facebook wants to

630
00:54:29,160 --> 00:54:38,120
get in on. Um, I don't know. Any thoughts on that with Facebook getting into that? Uh, I kind of

631
00:54:38,120 --> 00:54:43,560
does. It really does. Yeah. I was thinking of something like that. Something that is,

632
00:54:45,080 --> 00:54:49,000
you know, it all comes down to money anyway, but I think that they're trying to get in on the

633
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:55,320
younger market. Yes, that's for sure. Uh, going to our chat, uh, Legend of Zaku. Welcome back,

634
00:54:55,400 --> 00:55:00,280
by the way. And chat says, I can't see how this is a plus for Facebook other than to milk it to

635
00:55:00,280 --> 00:55:05,720
holy hell. Well, if they see money in it, that's how it's a plus for Facebook, but I could see how

636
00:55:05,720 --> 00:55:10,760
they might want to integrate it within Facebook where it's like, imagine if you're scrolling on

637
00:55:10,760 --> 00:55:16,520
your Facebook feed, right? And one thing you scroll across is, Hey, Oh, here's Bobby Blackwolf,

638
00:55:16,520 --> 00:55:22,120
uh, who just posted an update. Check out my newest version of flappy vog. And now it's right there

639
00:55:22,120 --> 00:55:25,640
on the feed. And you could check that out or you're scrolling past. There's Loki,

640
00:55:25,640 --> 00:55:31,640
here's pixel poops recreated in crater or YY or whoever makes it. And you can play it, uh, in your

641
00:55:31,640 --> 00:55:35,880
Facebook feed. I kind of think that might be a direction that Facebook's going in with that.

642
00:55:35,880 --> 00:55:40,280
Just like I always thought their Oculus acquisition was less about the games and more

643
00:55:40,280 --> 00:55:45,000
about, they want to be able to deliver like experiences in VR. They want to be able to have a

644
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:50,680
Facebook feed in VR, so to speak. I think that's where they want really want to be a few years from

645
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:56,440
now. Maybe not. It may be a hard thing to envision right now, but imagine if you, instead of reading

646
00:55:56,440 --> 00:56:02,280
somebody's update, got to experience somebody's update. I think that's where Facebook moves with

647
00:56:02,280 --> 00:56:07,240
Oculus. And I think that's where they want to experience my updates. And, and that's why I

648
00:56:07,240 --> 00:56:11,800
also kind of think like Facebook, it's a bit much, but I just feel like that's what they, that's

649
00:56:11,800 --> 00:56:16,920
where they're going with this is why not make your up? Why not make life updates experiences?

650
00:56:17,480 --> 00:56:20,760
And maybe you're not going to do it dark soccer, but I bet there's a lot of people,

651
00:56:21,400 --> 00:56:26,200
you know, especially as more and more younger folks are growing up with things like TikTok,

652
00:56:26,200 --> 00:56:31,560
Facebook, Instagram, uh, Twitter, all integrated into culture. I bet there's people that are going

653
00:56:31,560 --> 00:56:37,720
to be more than willing to share stuff, maybe too much so, uh, in this. The thing is, is that people

654
00:56:37,720 --> 00:56:43,800
are getting away from Facebook. I mean, this is my thought of like them trying to find a way to

655
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:51,160
bring people back, but fair in the end, their usage in certain demographics is way decreased.

656
00:56:51,160 --> 00:56:55,080
Yeah. I guess I don't think I've posted anything on Facebook other than,

657
00:56:55,080 --> 00:57:01,800
oh, we have OLR and I've done like Instagram stuff. I rarely post to Facebook anymore myself.

658
00:57:01,800 --> 00:57:05,880
Um, because, uh, you know, when I have a quick thought, Twitter's usually easier, but also just

659
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:10,120
like, and, and somebody was saying this on a podcast and I'm sorry, I don't remember who

660
00:57:10,120 --> 00:57:13,960
was saying it or what podcast, cause I was absorbing a lot of the last couple of weeks

661
00:57:13,960 --> 00:57:17,880
and a lot of driving that I was doing. But, um, somebody had said that, you know,

662
00:57:17,880 --> 00:57:23,320
Facebook was great when it was actually people's updates and pictures and things that were actually

663
00:57:23,320 --> 00:57:29,720
about people. But now you go on Facebook and all it is, it's headlines, it's clips, it's, um,

664
00:57:29,720 --> 00:57:37,800
uh, copy pasted links. It's, you know, uh, uh, things that are curated to get this emotional

665
00:57:37,800 --> 00:57:42,440
response from you to click an article. And it's not like the personality has been sucked out of

666
00:57:42,440 --> 00:57:49,480
Facebook. I think that was a great way of analyzing personal posts, you know, like Instagram is,

667
00:57:49,480 --> 00:57:55,080
you know, basically where my pictures come from. And, you know, I haven't logged into my,

668
00:57:55,080 --> 00:58:01,320
my sister's Facebook in two months for, for sisters of professional indulgence.

669
00:58:01,320 --> 00:58:05,240
But, um, but you know, I'm not saying like this live journal, you know, I'm not saying you

670
00:58:05,240 --> 00:58:08,840
specifically, or even the people in chat that are saying something similar specifically. I'm

671
00:58:08,840 --> 00:58:14,120
just saying Facebook as a whole is just hard to get through because it's nothing but emotional

672
00:58:14,120 --> 00:58:20,840
response crap. Yeah. And I'm, I think we're all, I want nothing to do with it. Yeah, I get you.

673
00:58:20,840 --> 00:58:24,200
Whatever happened to that pillow fort that was kind of like modern live journals,

674
00:58:24,200 --> 00:58:28,040
they ever come back, they got pulled offline for like a security thing. Did they ever come back?

675
00:58:28,920 --> 00:58:31,960
Remember you and I posted on there like twice and then they took it down.

676
00:58:32,600 --> 00:58:37,480
I have to look into that. All right. I have to look. I was eating eggs.

677
00:58:37,480 --> 00:58:41,560
No, you're fine. You're fine. Um, so I have to look into that. I am about to toss over the

678
00:58:41,560 --> 00:58:46,040
next story though. Just be warned. Uh, but I'm looking here. Okay, good. Looking in our chat, um,

679
00:58:46,600 --> 00:58:52,600
bonds, double six and chat says I post to Nami is back bitches every Saturday at 12.

680
00:58:52,600 --> 00:58:57,080
That's the bulk of my Facebook posts. That's fine. And that's a lot of what I see on Twitter,

681
00:58:57,080 --> 00:59:02,680
honestly, is that type of thing. So, uh, bonds double six also says I've been doing that for

682
00:59:02,680 --> 00:59:10,200
years. I have friends that DM me if I'm three minutes late. I love that. That's funny. All

683
00:59:10,200 --> 00:59:17,400
right. For the record, I just logged into pillow fort. Oh, so it works again. Looks like it's back.

684
00:59:17,400 --> 00:59:22,600
All right. I'll have to go make an update. That's fun. Follow me, you guys. All right.

685
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:26,840
Let's get into our next story though. Uh, dark side, speaking of people moving, right?

686
00:59:27,560 --> 00:59:34,600
Well, this isn't just moving. This is complete leaving. Um, Yuji Naka, the man, the legend,

687
00:59:34,600 --> 00:59:46,520
um, he has, uh, confirmed that he's left, uh, squinnicks. Um, he, uh, he actually did resign

688
00:59:46,520 --> 00:59:52,200
from his position in April. Um, he says he can't talk about it, but he's considering retiring from

689
00:59:52,360 --> 00:59:57,640
video games altogether. Um, the quote, and I'll just read it directly translated. Of course,

690
00:59:58,520 --> 01:00:04,440
due to inquiries from the media and users on Twitters, I resigned from square annex at the end

691
01:00:04,440 --> 01:00:09,560
of April, 2021. I cannot tell you why right now, but I hope to be able to tell you when the time

692
01:00:09,560 --> 01:00:15,720
comes as for my future plans, I'm already 55 years old. So retirement is in the cards. Here is a photo

693
01:00:15,720 --> 01:00:21,480
that was taken for the Sega console Historia interview. So it's a cute photo.

694
01:00:24,360 --> 01:00:28,920
So I've seen this has to do with Bella and Wonderland not being so wonderful.

695
01:00:28,920 --> 01:00:34,040
It did not sell well in Japan. It, uh, apparently the sales, I don't know how it did here,

696
01:00:34,040 --> 01:00:38,920
but I don't think it did very well here either. And I think, I think it was that demo. I think

697
01:00:38,920 --> 01:00:45,320
that demo scared so many people off. Uh, I think it's gonna, I think this could be one for,

698
01:00:45,400 --> 01:00:51,640
you know, the, the history archives about, um, what to not do with your demo. But I think at the end,

699
01:00:51,640 --> 01:00:57,560
at the end, um, but Nino Cooney still sold enough to make a sequel, even though that demo was

700
01:00:57,560 --> 01:01:01,640
terrible, but I don't know if it's just maybe the state of social media now versus the state

701
01:01:01,640 --> 01:01:06,680
of social media when Nino Cooney's demo was out, which was a long time ago at this point. Um,

702
01:01:06,680 --> 01:01:12,040
but that really to, and I, to be fair, I don't think the game either really got a,

703
01:01:12,040 --> 01:01:16,280
turned a lot of heads. Some people are really into it. That game definitely has its defenders

704
01:01:16,280 --> 01:01:20,120
and I haven't played it. So I don't have an opinion either way, but I can say the way y'all

705
01:01:20,120 --> 01:01:26,280
reacted to it, uh, made me go and I can pass on this, but it's sad for somebody like Yuji Naka,

706
01:01:26,280 --> 01:01:34,840
who has such a legendary resume. Um, but at the same time, sometimes, sometimes great artists flop

707
01:01:34,840 --> 01:01:40,120
and it happens. It happens in music. I have a picture of Dan and Yuji Naka from the early

708
01:01:40,120 --> 01:01:45,080
2000s. Oh, that's awesome. From like E3 or something. Look at Mighty No. 9. I mean,

709
01:01:45,640 --> 01:01:51,720
that was something that like had the pedigree to be really great, but it just didn't end up

710
01:01:51,720 --> 01:01:57,480
working out. Yeah. And this, this happens sometimes in, in like music, like, uh, Kelly

711
01:01:57,480 --> 01:02:03,080
Clarkson's My December album compared to her others, not her greatest one. And there's,

712
01:02:03,080 --> 01:02:05,800
there's plenty of others too. I don't know why that one came to mind. I'm trying to think of

713
01:02:05,800 --> 01:02:11,000
musicians where it's like, they released a real stinker, but a lot of their albums are usually

714
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:16,280
pretty better well-received. Uh, and movies. I'm sure y'all know, I'm sure y'all know a director

715
01:02:16,280 --> 01:02:20,840
who makes great movies, but then they put out a real, a real turd once in a while. Like it

716
01:02:20,840 --> 01:02:29,160
happens, right? So, um, Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, uh, Saint Anger by Metallica is an example

717
01:02:29,160 --> 01:02:35,080
of what I was talking about. Um, so, uh, PixelPakas agrees. This is My December. Yep.

718
01:02:35,080 --> 01:02:39,640
Uh, and, uh, there are folks in chat are talking about if, uh, uh, the Battle of Wonderland,

719
01:02:39,640 --> 01:02:44,760
it flopped hard. Uh, Square has already put it on sale at least once, says Sacred Jade.

720
01:02:44,760 --> 01:02:50,760
Uh, Mike Deff says not even like two weeks after release and it's already $20 USD off.

721
01:02:50,760 --> 01:02:55,880
Yep. Uh, Questbuster in chat says Shroud of the Avatar by Richard Garriott. Oh,

722
01:02:55,880 --> 01:03:01,160
how about you want to talk Lord British? What about his, uh, MMO Tabula Rasa? That's there's,

723
01:03:01,160 --> 01:03:06,680
there you go. That was a stinker, um, for his resume too, even though obviously he's an all

724
01:03:06,680 --> 01:03:12,040
time great and so forth, but, uh, yeah. Um, so anyway, I'm not, you know, it's a bummer though,

725
01:03:12,040 --> 01:03:17,400
that it, all it took was like this one game and now Yuji Naka is like, eh, maybe I won't be doing

726
01:03:17,400 --> 01:03:23,640
anything else for Square Enix, but I'm sure Square Enix saw this as being like a franchise. And

727
01:03:23,720 --> 01:03:28,680
clearly that's not going to happen. Right. So, yeah, I still kind of want to play it.

728
01:03:29,560 --> 01:03:34,200
Yeah. Well, and the good news for what it's worth is that it'll probably be very cheap to do so. Um,

729
01:03:35,800 --> 01:03:41,000
it'll probably be a free game of the month on some services or a game pass thing or whatever

730
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:45,160
pretty well. Did it come out on Xbox? I can't even remember. Uh, it'll be, it'll be on all

731
01:03:45,160 --> 01:03:51,800
sorts of those services pretty soon. All right. Anyhow, let's move on. Um, let's,

732
01:03:51,800 --> 01:03:56,760
let's talk about things that went from bad to good. Yeah. I'm surprised to see that we're

733
01:03:56,760 --> 01:04:03,000
still getting more updates. So like, this is like completely, we just had an update not that long

734
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:10,200
ago, but now of course, a hello game saying hello, here's yet another update. Um, so they released

735
01:04:10,200 --> 01:04:15,560
prisms, which is a update for no man's sky that adds several different features of the game,

736
01:04:15,560 --> 01:04:21,080
including some additional, uh, graphic improvements, including fur, uh, light

737
01:04:21,080 --> 01:04:26,760
refraction in the rain, more details to the cave environments, reflective metal in space stations

738
01:04:26,760 --> 01:04:35,000
and more also flying, um, pet mounts that you can get. And yeah, I mean, it just looks pretty cool.

739
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:40,040
I'm just surprised to see, like, like I thought we were at a point where like, yeah, this is

740
01:04:40,040 --> 01:04:44,520
pretty good now. And now they're like, but you know what? It could be even better. Yeah. Right.

741
01:04:45,160 --> 01:04:49,960
Um, and you look, I'm the resident, no man's sky fan boy here, I think in the house. And I played

742
01:04:49,960 --> 01:04:55,560
this update a little bit. I'm kind of waiting on expedition three, you know, expedition two ended

743
01:04:55,560 --> 01:05:00,120
with the big surprise that you unlock the Normandy, but we're in a low right now. There is no active

744
01:05:00,120 --> 01:05:03,560
expedition. So you just have the base game right now. You can use all the rewards that you've done

745
01:05:03,560 --> 01:05:07,160
through expeditions and stuff, but, um, that that's it. Right. So I'm kind of waiting on

746
01:05:07,160 --> 01:05:12,760
expedition three to really jump back in, but I did look a little bit, um, at some of the changes.

747
01:05:12,840 --> 01:05:18,200
Like I played for maybe like 30 minutes and yeah, they, they really enhance the space station with

748
01:05:18,200 --> 01:05:21,800
like a better background. It looks really cool. And, uh, you know, when you're like,

749
01:05:22,600 --> 01:05:28,040
walking on the floor and stuff, it's really, um, yeah, it does like, it's, you can notice some of

750
01:05:28,040 --> 01:05:32,280
the visual updates. It looks really good, but the crazy part is, and Loki, you're kind of referring

751
01:05:32,280 --> 01:05:38,120
to this, is that they just did a graphical update to this game in November. They, they just,

752
01:05:38,120 --> 01:05:43,480
cause they did the big update to make it next gen, uh, from, or, you know, from PS4 type graphics

753
01:05:43,480 --> 01:05:48,920
to PS5 type graphics. That was just in November. And now we're getting another big graphical

754
01:05:48,920 --> 01:05:53,560
update. That's crazy. I really need to go back and play this game. I have it on PC,

755
01:05:53,560 --> 01:05:58,520
never played it on PC, but like, I bet it was just like incredible now. Although the longer I wait,

756
01:05:58,520 --> 01:06:01,880
the better it's going to look. So that's, I'll just wait a little bit longer, I guess.

757
01:06:02,520 --> 01:06:08,360
Yeah. Uh, SSU100Matt in chat says, no man's sky is one of those great gaming comeback stories,

758
01:06:08,360 --> 01:06:13,160
perhaps the greatest. And Miltonias Games in chat follows that up saying no man's sky and Final

759
01:06:13,160 --> 01:06:17,320
Fantasy 14 are right up there for biggest turnaround. And yeah, I'd agree with that.

760
01:06:17,320 --> 01:06:21,320
I mean, the only other thing I can think of that's nearly as big is Final Fantasy 14. And

761
01:06:21,320 --> 01:06:29,240
I think what makes 14's trajectory unique is that 14 is still growing. It's still getting more and

762
01:06:29,240 --> 01:06:32,680
more fans. And there was a very, you know, just a tangent a little bit, but you guys all know,

763
01:06:32,680 --> 01:06:36,120
I follow Final Fantasy 14 stuff. There was a really interesting interview that just came

764
01:06:36,120 --> 01:06:42,120
out with Yoshi P where he kind of talked about, they intentionally did not advertise during the

765
01:06:42,120 --> 01:06:47,000
pandemic to make it look like they were capitalizing on the stay at home situation

766
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:52,360
and all that, which I thought was really, um, classy. Um, but at the same time, he didn't deny

767
01:06:53,400 --> 01:06:58,840
that the game has been there for people in this whole, you know, COVID and quarantine time and

768
01:06:58,840 --> 01:07:03,080
the pandemic and all that. So he sort of acknowledged, yes, it's helped the game,

769
01:07:03,080 --> 01:07:10,680
but we've tried not to lean into that too much. Um, but you know, uh, not every video game grew

770
01:07:10,680 --> 01:07:15,240
during the pandemic. Sure. Things like Animal Crossing did as well, but you know, for every

771
01:07:15,240 --> 01:07:19,480
huge, you know, game that took off during the pandemic, there were still some stinkers.

772
01:07:19,480 --> 01:07:23,080
We could talk about some games that didn't make that same turnaround. Hello, Anthem.

773
01:07:23,800 --> 01:07:29,480
Oops. It was supposed to, but it didn't. Oops. Um, I would say the only other game that really

774
01:07:29,480 --> 01:07:33,640
comes close that I can think of off the top of my head is Diablo 3, but I would, I mean,

775
01:07:35,080 --> 01:07:39,560
and don't, I'm not trying to sell short Diablo 3's turnaround, which was huge. And it was probably

776
01:07:39,560 --> 01:07:44,360
the first out of all these games. But, uh, I really think Final Fantasy 14 story and now No

777
01:07:44,360 --> 01:07:49,960
Man's Sky story again is one for the history books, uh, as far as I'm concerned, which is

778
01:07:49,960 --> 01:07:56,120
pretty cool. Huh? Uh, Mike Deaf says Super Mario Party with its online update. I don't think Super

779
01:07:56,120 --> 01:08:01,720
Mario Party was quite as, um, raked over the coals as the other games when they first came out.

780
01:08:02,280 --> 01:08:08,200
So, um, Miltonias Games pointing out Elder Scrolls Online also did good. That's true.

781
01:08:08,200 --> 01:08:12,280
Elder Scrolls Online, I think also has their next big update, like what? June 15th. It's really

782
01:08:12,280 --> 01:08:17,800
soon. That's another one I need to check out because I tried the beta back when it was like

783
01:08:17,800 --> 01:08:23,960
first available and I just could not get into it. Like it just wasn't like, I like Elder Scrolls

784
01:08:23,960 --> 01:08:30,760
and I can play it online. Sweet. But then, then I played them like, this isn't like Skyrim at all.

785
01:08:30,760 --> 01:08:36,440
And then, so I just kind of like fell out of it, but like, maybe that I think it's still a game

786
01:08:36,440 --> 01:08:43,480
pass. So maybe it is. It is. And, um, you know, again, not to, not to like belittle this comment,

787
01:08:43,480 --> 01:08:47,000
you know, about Elder Scrolls Online, but one thing I do want to point out why it's not usually

788
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:51,320
said in the same breath. Look at the reviews with, when Elder Scrolls Online first came out

789
01:08:51,320 --> 01:08:56,680
and when Final Fantasy 14 1.0 first came out. I don't think Elder Scrolls Online got rave reviews,

790
01:08:57,240 --> 01:09:04,280
but it did not get completely shit on like Final Fantasy 14 1.0 did and deservedly so. And you guys

791
01:09:04,280 --> 01:09:11,240
all know I'm a huge Final Fantasy 14 fan boy. 1.0 is the worst MMO I've ever played. It is fucking

792
01:09:11,240 --> 01:09:16,280
terrible. Um, and it, that game went through a complete transformation. And so I think that's

793
01:09:16,280 --> 01:09:20,520
why you don't often hear it in the same, you don't hear like Elder Scrolls Online in the same

794
01:09:20,520 --> 01:09:26,120
breath, not to belittle or, uh, you know, uh, minimize the achievements that that game has

795
01:09:26,120 --> 01:09:31,960
had over the years. But it went from, it's all right to, oh, neat. It's still going after all

796
01:09:31,960 --> 01:09:39,000
these years. Whereas Final Fantasy 1.0 was like, this is fucking garbage, mom, to it's incredible.

797
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:43,560
And, you know, probably the biggest MMO out there right now. Like, I do think we're at a point

798
01:09:43,560 --> 01:09:49,320
where Final Fantasy 14 is said more than WoW is. I think that's the reality, you know? So,

799
01:09:49,320 --> 01:09:52,360
but I thought, again, there was a really cool interview with Yoshi P. I think it was the same

800
01:09:52,360 --> 01:09:57,960
interview actually, where he kind of acknowledged Final Fantasy 14 would not have been reborn in

801
01:09:57,960 --> 01:10:03,080
this way if it wasn't for WoW. And he says, I'm a Blizzard fan boy. I've been able to go to

802
01:10:03,080 --> 01:10:07,640
Blizzard's campus like three times and I've had a great time every time. And I love talking to their

803
01:10:07,640 --> 01:10:14,360
team and, and I love hearing how many people at Blizzard play the game. And, um, yeah. So

804
01:10:14,360 --> 01:10:19,640
I think it's, I think it's great that there is that love between the two. Um, and maybe Blizzard

805
01:10:19,640 --> 01:10:23,400
maybe is thinking maybe it's time for successor to World of Warcraft. I don't know. I don't know.

806
01:10:23,400 --> 01:10:28,280
I'm, I'm probably getting ahead of myself. Yeah. And like, it might just be, I think,

807
01:10:28,840 --> 01:10:35,560
and there's not, I think WoW has just lived its life, you know? And sure you come at me with the

808
01:10:35,560 --> 01:10:41,240
EverQuest has 29 expansions or whatever. Sure. Fine. Yes. Yes. Like even, even with that though,

809
01:10:41,240 --> 01:10:46,200
like eventually it has to end. I mean, it's just going forever. Cause it's just, it looks,

810
01:10:46,200 --> 01:10:52,680
it starts to get dated. I mean like it, they want to put something out more modern to draw people

811
01:10:52,680 --> 01:10:57,640
in. Let me rephrase. I think this says it better. World of Warcraft has peaked.

812
01:10:58,680 --> 01:11:01,960
Final Fantasy 14 doesn't seem like it's peaked yet.

813
01:11:01,960 --> 01:11:09,800
So, and this next expansion may make it even bigger. So I think that's the key difference.

814
01:11:09,800 --> 01:11:16,120
So anyway, uh, all right. Uh, let's move on. I'm talking, I went from No Man's Sky to MMO chat,

815
01:11:16,120 --> 01:11:20,280
but, uh, you know, these are, these are genres I'm passionate about. What can I say? Let's say,

816
01:11:20,280 --> 01:11:25,080
Hey, a lot of people have passion for Nintendo as well. And what if you could visit an official

817
01:11:25,080 --> 01:11:29,240
Nintendo museum? That sounds pretty rad, right? In fact, actually I think a lot of the reason

818
01:11:29,240 --> 01:11:33,960
people love to go to the New York city store is that they have like, it's very, very, but it

819
01:11:33,960 --> 01:11:39,000
feels like a Nintendo shrine of sorts. Yes. With lots and lots of merchandise to sell you,

820
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:42,840
but they have like those tiny little exhibits upstairs. Like, Oh, here's the game boy that

821
01:11:42,840 --> 01:11:47,240
got destroyed in desert storm. Right. They have those things at the New York city store. Um,

822
01:11:47,240 --> 01:11:51,400
I think a lot of people would love to see a actual large Nintendo museum and guess what?

823
01:11:51,400 --> 01:11:56,680
One is coming. Uh, in about three years, you're going to get to visit a museum in Japan. So you

824
01:11:56,680 --> 01:12:01,720
got to go there, but celebrating everything about Nintendo, they are going to be repurposing

825
01:12:01,720 --> 01:12:07,720
an old factory into a gallery that will showcase consoles and other products that Nintendo has

826
01:12:07,720 --> 01:12:12,200
launched throughout Nintendo's history. Uh, they're hoping to make it a tourist attraction.

827
01:12:12,200 --> 01:12:18,200
So it's going to be the Uji Ogura plant, uh, and the surrounding land will be taking, uh,

828
01:12:18,200 --> 01:12:22,520
taking that on. Uh, and I think this has to do they're, they're choosing this because the

829
01:12:22,520 --> 01:12:29,080
Oguro station is also being, uh, re redeveloped in Japan. Um, so that's pretty cool. This is by

830
01:12:29,080 --> 01:12:34,280
the way, right outside Kyoto. Um, and, uh, this is hopefully a way to bring back more tourists.

831
01:12:34,280 --> 01:12:38,600
So that's pretty rad. Uh, this plant, by the way, used to manufacture playing cards and the

832
01:12:38,600 --> 01:12:44,280
Hanafuda cards. Uh, and it was also a customer service site for product repairs. And so now,

833
01:12:44,280 --> 01:12:49,160
this that's all moved to a newer factory. Uh, or are you showing some of those cards on stream

834
01:12:49,160 --> 01:12:54,520
right now? Dark Sakura looks like, yeah, I have the Mario Hanahuda cards. You can order

835
01:12:55,240 --> 01:13:00,840
them, um, actually on Nintendo's website. So the Nintendo gallery, uh, which is the early name for

836
01:13:00,840 --> 01:13:06,520
this project, no word on when it will open yet, but they're targeting March, 2024. So that's

837
01:13:06,520 --> 01:13:13,960
pretty exciting. Lots of stuff to, uh, visit in Japan in 2024. Um, the legend is Zaku and chat

838
01:13:13,960 --> 01:13:18,840
says Japan done fucked up COVID after initially doing very well against it last year. I think

839
01:13:18,840 --> 01:13:24,680
it's probably one of those things where it just, the surge didn't hit until later and it's, it's

840
01:13:24,680 --> 01:13:29,960
unfortunate. It's probably going to ruin the Olympics. Yeah, it's, it is. You're, you're seeing

841
01:13:29,960 --> 01:13:35,720
other countries now kind of going through it. Like obviously what, what happened in India is just

842
01:13:37,160 --> 01:13:42,840
horrific. Words can't even describe it. India though did have a mass mismanagement. Um,

843
01:13:43,080 --> 01:13:50,680
yeah, Japan actually being a society that already masks was really good in the beginning for holding

844
01:13:50,680 --> 01:13:57,080
out. Um, it's just the way that they were dealing with vaccinations. I'm really glad we're starting

845
01:13:57,080 --> 01:14:01,160
to pass off some of our surplus vaccinations to other parts of the world. I think that's a great

846
01:14:01,160 --> 01:14:07,080
thing. It makes me, makes me happy to be an American when sometimes, especially in the last

847
01:14:07,080 --> 01:14:11,640
four years, there were not, I wasn't always feeling that way when I got out of bed. So

848
01:14:11,640 --> 01:14:16,920
that's great. All right. Um, let's move on. What do we have next? Dark Sagra.

849
01:14:17,960 --> 01:14:27,480
Well, um, there is more law site law, lawsuit news. Um, Nintendo filed a lawsuit against a

850
01:14:27,480 --> 01:14:34,760
ROM website called ROM universe and that was in 2019. Um, and it has since been concluded,

851
01:14:34,760 --> 01:14:40,360
the judge has ruled in Nintendo's favor saying that ROM universe, and I'm going to quote,

852
01:14:40,360 --> 01:14:47,480
is a straightforward video game piracy case, the, the, the situation. Um, and that the site was

853
01:14:47,480 --> 01:14:52,200
quote populated the website with pirated copies of thousands of different Nintendo games and

854
01:14:52,200 --> 01:14:57,720
distributed hundreds of thousands of copies of those pirated games because, uh, they also

855
01:14:58,440 --> 01:15:06,200
sold paid premium accounts. So, um, so basically they were making money off of pirated material

856
01:15:06,200 --> 01:15:15,320
instead of it just being like a free to download kind of thing. Um, so, uh, basically, um,

857
01:15:15,320 --> 01:15:21,000
they, Nintendo was seeking over 15 million in copyright and trademark infringement damages.

858
01:15:21,720 --> 01:15:29,320
Um, the company is going to be paying less than that. They ruled, uh, 35,000, uh, in statutory

859
01:15:29,320 --> 01:15:37,960
damages for the 49 copyrights, uh, is enough. So they'll be paying 1.7 million. Um, Nintendo was

860
01:15:37,960 --> 01:15:45,640
looking for 90,000 to per work. So this is better for the company, but, um, the total that they're

861
01:15:45,640 --> 01:15:52,680
going to be receiving is 2,115,000. So don't sell ROMs.

862
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:56,200
Don't sell them, give them for free.

863
01:15:57,160 --> 01:16:01,000
Which I guess this site, it kind of did that, but they had the subscription thing, right?

864
01:16:03,240 --> 01:16:07,720
Uh, yeah, that was the thing. And they, they sold premium subscriptions.

865
01:16:07,720 --> 01:16:13,880
Yeah. Yeah. Don't, don't make money off Nintendo. They have a way of finding you and,

866
01:16:13,880 --> 01:16:21,000
and, uh, destroying you. Their, their fingers are up everyone's ass and not in a good way.

867
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:25,640
And I was going to say, I was going to say, not everybody's going to complain about that.

868
01:16:25,640 --> 01:16:27,160
Anyway, Loki quick change the subject.

869
01:16:28,360 --> 01:16:34,920
All right. Well, I mean, I'd like to change the subject, but, um, topic of ass we're

870
01:16:34,920 --> 01:16:43,560
talking about the Atari VCS console coming out. Um, eh, yeah, it's finally out, I guess,

871
01:16:43,560 --> 01:16:49,560
but I mean, I'm, I don't know. Um, it's coming out on the 15th of June. It's going to be

872
01:16:49,560 --> 01:16:54,520
starting at $300, but apparently they have a version with a classic, you know,

873
01:16:54,520 --> 01:17:01,160
Atari 26 under controller and you know, your modern controller for $400, um, be available

874
01:17:01,160 --> 01:17:10,440
in retail soon. Is it any good? I don't know. It's like a PC, I guess, but I'm not all that

875
01:17:10,440 --> 01:17:15,080
excited about it to be honest. I mean, the console is a cool shape, but it's just, it's basically

876
01:17:15,080 --> 01:17:21,080
just a rising chip in there. So if I wanted one of those, I just build my own PC.

877
01:17:22,680 --> 01:17:28,680
Any, uh, Atari VCS fans in the house and chat anybody, uh, pre-ordering their Atari VCS.

878
01:17:28,680 --> 01:17:33,080
No, like, I, I know I'm sounding very, but I literally want to know, like,

879
01:17:33,080 --> 01:17:34,840
what is motivating people to get this system?

880
01:17:38,120 --> 01:17:42,840
Yeah. I mean, it's, I don't know. It's just not something I'm looking for. I like the case. I

881
01:17:42,840 --> 01:17:46,440
like the design of it. It would have been cool if it was like a dedicated console that

882
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:51,960
they had more, you know, into it, but like, it sounded like it was just like a PC running

883
01:17:51,960 --> 01:17:55,080
something that I think that's already available right now. They have like some Atari software

884
01:17:55,080 --> 01:18:00,120
that's already available. You can play some of these classic games on, but I don't know.

885
01:18:00,120 --> 01:18:06,120
It's just not as cool as it originally sounded. When's the Atari hotel coming? Let's talk about

886
01:18:06,120 --> 01:18:11,560
something that's that's positive. Is it? I don't know. I figured the pandemic,

887
01:18:11,560 --> 01:18:16,120
well, I figured the pandemic fucked it all up, but I'm, I'm still all about staying at the

888
01:18:16,120 --> 01:18:21,800
Atari hotel. I mean, that does look pretty cool. And I mean, maybe I'll get to play a VCS at the

889
01:18:21,800 --> 01:18:27,240
Atari hotel, the hotel, you know, they'll have it in each room. Uh, the hotel kind of looks more

890
01:18:27,240 --> 01:18:34,280
like Tron than it does Atari hotel. I failed to see the problem. I don't, I'm not seeing that's

891
01:18:34,280 --> 01:18:39,320
a bad thing. I'm saying that maybe they should lean that direction a little bit more than the

892
01:18:39,320 --> 01:18:45,720
Atari thing. Um, yeah, it's coming in 2022 right now. So not yet, but yeah, I mean,

893
01:18:45,720 --> 01:18:50,200
I figured the pandemic slowed those plans down, but yeah, it's way better than what the Hooters

894
01:18:50,200 --> 01:18:55,960
hotel they have, or I know they have a hotel. It's all woodgrain and it's something trashy like that

895
01:18:55,960 --> 01:19:03,640
pass. Yeah. All right. Moving on. Oh, pixel pockets clarifies the Hooters hotel is gone.

896
01:19:04,600 --> 01:19:10,440
Oh, was it in Florida? This sounds like a Florida thing. No, no, no. It was in Vegas. Um, it's been

897
01:19:10,440 --> 01:19:15,880
a long time since I've been to Vegas. It was on a business trip and I saw that when we were going to,

898
01:19:15,880 --> 01:19:23,560
um, Oh gosh, what was it? Uh, to, to shoe company. Um, I don't remember, but they were going to,

899
01:19:23,560 --> 01:19:29,400
they were going to buy games. Um, I remember this being a thing now. Yes. Zappos when we were going

900
01:19:29,400 --> 01:19:36,920
to Zappos, uh, we drove past it and I was like, that looks trashy. I wonder what, I wonder what

901
01:19:36,920 --> 01:19:40,840
turnover the casinos has happened in Vegas during the pandemic. Cause I know Hard Rock's gone.

902
01:19:40,840 --> 01:19:47,240
It's now, it's now the Virgin hotel or something like that Richard Branson's, uh, Virgin. Um, so

903
01:19:47,240 --> 01:19:51,080
I'm curious how that all probably looks at this point, but, uh, I wonder what other casino

904
01:19:51,080 --> 01:19:55,800
turnovers have happened. I wonder if there will be an Atari, uh, casino in Vegas at some point,

905
01:19:55,800 --> 01:20:00,200
who knows? Uh, Questbuster says there's a new mega hotel opening up next to the Wynn.

906
01:20:00,200 --> 01:20:06,280
Where did they have room next to the Wynn? I guess I'm on top of each other. No,

907
01:20:06,280 --> 01:20:12,200
that where the Stardust used to be, I think was, was, uh, still open. Maybe I, my memory's a little

908
01:20:12,200 --> 01:20:17,240
fuzzy, but anyway. All right. Uh, let's move on this. Speaking of things from the past,

909
01:20:17,240 --> 01:20:23,400
I think this is very interesting. Uh, we have Ken and Roberta Williams back in the news. Um,

910
01:20:23,400 --> 01:20:27,720
you thought they were retired and, and quite frankly, so did they probably, but they got

911
01:20:27,720 --> 01:20:32,040
bored. I have a feeling and, you know, Bobby talked a little bit about this on his show too,

912
01:20:32,040 --> 01:20:36,040
but it is, it's, it's a thought I certainly had as well as that, you know what? Um,

913
01:20:36,040 --> 01:20:42,200
they were probably ready to sail around the world, do the, you know, months long cruise,

914
01:20:42,200 --> 01:20:48,200
go travel to all these different places and then up. Can't do that right now. Right. Bad idea.

915
01:20:48,200 --> 01:20:53,240
So maybe we'll just get right back into making a video game or at least, you know, I don't

916
01:20:53,720 --> 01:20:57,240
especially hearing about this project. I don't think they're like really getting in there the

917
01:20:57,240 --> 01:21:02,760
way they used to with the classic Sierra online games, but even to see them contributing to a

918
01:21:02,760 --> 01:21:07,000
newer game is, you know, it's a neat thought and a neat idea. It's just neat that we haven't seen

919
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:12,040
the last of Ken and Roberta Williams. So what the hell is going on? Let's, uh, talk about it.

920
01:21:12,040 --> 01:21:17,960
They are working on a new game, uh, with a 3d artist, Marcus Maximus Mara. We don't know the,

921
01:21:17,960 --> 01:21:22,440
uh, project title beyond something called the secret. We don't know if that's like actually

922
01:21:22,440 --> 01:21:27,000
the name of the game. Uh, I would, I would hope this would not be confused with that book

923
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:32,920
that was on every talk show, uh, in what the two thousands. Right. So anyway, uh, this is a game

924
01:21:32,920 --> 01:21:39,640
called the secret for now. Um, or it's just, you know, a secret. Um, there is a website that you

925
01:21:39,640 --> 01:21:45,880
can visit. Uh, it's at kensgame.com. If you want to see more about it. Um, not a lot of details on

926
01:21:45,880 --> 01:21:49,640
the game yet, but it talks about what's going on behind the scenes. What is it going to be?

927
01:21:49,640 --> 01:21:54,680
A Sierra flavored or a Sierra inspired a Sierra, you know, a hint of Sierra game,

928
01:21:54,680 --> 01:22:01,080
uh, single player game. Think things like King's quest. Larry, it's going to be an adventure game.

929
01:22:01,080 --> 01:22:06,760
Modern audiences will be in mind though. And you know, they, they did a King's quest reboot. They

930
01:22:06,760 --> 01:22:12,280
not Ken and Roberta, but they being another company did a King's quest reboot probably

931
01:22:12,280 --> 01:22:17,560
about five years ago at this point. And it wasn't bad at all. I enjoyed it. I didn't play the whole

932
01:22:17,560 --> 01:22:21,960
thing, but I played like the first episode, maybe a little bit of the second and I enjoyed it. Um,

933
01:22:21,960 --> 01:22:27,640
so I think, you know, if it's something along those lines, Hey, I'm happy anyway. Um, especially,

934
01:22:27,640 --> 01:22:33,000
you know, I would love to see Ken and Roberta Williams take on the walking SIM genre. I know

935
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:38,040
that that's sometimes used as a negative. I see walking SIM as a positive. There are so many good

936
01:22:38,040 --> 01:22:44,040
games such as, you know, everybody's gone to the rapture, dear Esther, um, uh, what remains of

937
01:22:44,040 --> 01:22:48,440
Edith Finch, you know, so many great games. Uh, I would love to see their take on that. I don't

938
01:22:48,440 --> 01:22:52,920
know if that's going to be this cause it's going to be a little more Sierra inspired, but, uh,

939
01:22:52,920 --> 01:22:57,800
yeah, who knows, who knows where this could actually end up going. Um, they've been developing

940
01:22:57,800 --> 01:23:02,680
this game over the past six months. They do. They are warning you on the game's website that

941
01:23:02,680 --> 01:23:07,160
Roberta's involvement has been kind of minimal, but she's supposed to be getting more involved

942
01:23:07,160 --> 01:23:13,080
as they get closer to release. So I don't really know what that actually means. It sounds like

943
01:23:13,080 --> 01:23:17,640
maybe she's not doing the bulk of the writing, but maybe she's contributing ideas, plot twists,

944
01:23:17,640 --> 01:23:22,760
things like that. I don't know. Um, we'll see as this develops, their goal is to release the game

945
01:23:22,760 --> 01:23:27,320
in November, but they're still working with placeholder graphics. And so I have a feeling

946
01:23:27,320 --> 01:23:30,200
this is not going to be, and most people have a feeling this isn't actually going to happen

947
01:23:30,200 --> 01:23:36,120
this year. Um, but maybe demos and screenshots at a later date. Um, supposedly another contributor

948
01:23:36,120 --> 01:23:42,120
on this project as well. They haven't named yet. Um, so I don't know, again, don't think that like

949
01:23:42,200 --> 01:23:46,520
they're building a game from the ground up, like they did in the eighties and nineties,

950
01:23:46,520 --> 01:23:50,520
because video games aren't made today. Like they were made in the eighties and nineties, right?

951
01:23:50,520 --> 01:23:55,160
It wasn't uncommon for one person to make a game in the eighties and nineties. Now it takes a team

952
01:23:55,160 --> 01:23:58,680
of people. And I know what you're thinking. Yeah, there are plenty of ways for one per,

953
01:23:58,680 --> 01:24:02,600
what about Axiom Verge? What about Pixel Poops? And there's plenty of games that one person can

954
01:24:02,600 --> 01:24:07,480
make, but I think to fit their vision and what they want to do, they're going to need more than

955
01:24:07,480 --> 01:24:11,560
just them to do it. So I think they're really kind of just contributing, you know, and, uh,

956
01:24:11,560 --> 01:24:16,200
just not really leaving gaming behind, especially in the face of a pandemic and what's going on

957
01:24:16,200 --> 01:24:20,680
with that. So, um, but I'll still play it. That's for sure. I'll check it out.

958
01:24:22,520 --> 01:24:30,280
I think they're great. Um, looking in chat over at twitch.tv slash a vog network, uh,

959
01:24:30,280 --> 01:24:34,200
Dr. Sia says, I'm tempted to start some of the older games because I got a hold of some of them

960
01:24:34,200 --> 01:24:38,680
for free. Like the space and police quest games missed them back in the eighties and nineties

961
01:24:38,680 --> 01:24:44,120
didn't get a PC till way past all of that. Just keep in mind, a lot of your modern conveniences

962
01:24:44,120 --> 01:24:48,680
and adventure games, aren't going to necessarily be present, especially in the early, early Kings

963
01:24:48,680 --> 01:24:53,640
quest games. It didn't start to get a little more graphical to like Kings quest for, um, was when

964
01:24:53,640 --> 01:24:58,760
the interface really changed. So just, just keep that in mind. Um, and you can skip the last Kings

965
01:24:58,760 --> 01:25:04,840
quest game, just, you know, all right. Yeah. Quest buster and chat says on Rob's note,

966
01:25:04,840 --> 01:25:10,680
early adventure games love to kill the player, but that was kind of the fun. I mean, I know people

967
01:25:10,680 --> 01:25:15,480
hate dying in games and having to start over, but it was kind of fun to see all the creative shit

968
01:25:15,480 --> 01:25:19,560
that they'd kill your character with in those games. And it wasn't graphic or anything, you

969
01:25:19,560 --> 01:25:24,600
know, it was a fantasy. It was just, you know, a lot of it was implied. So something to think

970
01:25:24,600 --> 01:25:30,760
about there. All right. Um, let's move on. So this is going to be a fun surprise for people,

971
01:25:30,760 --> 01:25:35,240
I think, because we have a fresh coat of paint on a very familiar segment. So let's get into it.

972
01:25:45,960 --> 01:25:51,640
And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time or I'll dive into the vault and pull out

973
01:25:51,640 --> 01:25:56,360
a classic and tell you about it. It's time for the classic game of the week.

974
01:26:03,320 --> 01:26:05,560
All right. And what is the classic game of the week?

975
01:26:10,040 --> 01:26:10,840
Jamie, you're muted.

976
01:26:14,920 --> 01:26:18,840
Then no one heard me say, Oh, fuck. Oh, wait, you did. Um, no, I didn't hear it either. You're

977
01:26:18,840 --> 01:26:23,800
muted on discord. That's right. The classic game is portal two. Um, yes, it is that old.

978
01:26:25,320 --> 01:26:35,640
You're welcome. So, um, at any rate, uh, portal two came out in 2011 in, uh, I want to say

979
01:26:37,160 --> 01:26:44,760
April. So yes, it is, uh, 10. It is, uh, it's 10 years old.

980
01:26:45,240 --> 01:26:54,680
Yep. You, you all should feel oldish. Um, so it was released, uh, by valve for windows,

981
01:26:54,680 --> 01:27:04,520
Mac OS 10, Linux, uh, PlayStation three and X-Box three 60. Um, the digital version was, uh,

982
01:27:04,520 --> 01:27:12,760
distributed online by valves steam service and the other retail, uh, additions were by electronic

983
01:27:13,640 --> 01:27:22,520
arts. So basically it is a, uh, an update of the original portal with a lot more silliness.

984
01:27:23,240 --> 01:27:28,440
Um, you, the one portal of one color, you come out through the portal of another color

985
01:27:29,240 --> 01:27:35,960
and, uh, however, and by the way, you're still are, are, uh, controlling Chell, who is, uh,

986
01:27:36,600 --> 01:27:44,120
the test subject. And she has been asleep for some time and was woken up by a robot or a, uh,

987
01:27:44,120 --> 01:27:52,520
I guess he's a core really, um, named Wheatley who is voiced by Steven merchant. Um, and so, uh,

988
01:27:53,240 --> 01:28:00,520
you go through the game and you start to discover other things, uh, other types of puzzles that were

989
01:28:00,520 --> 01:28:05,640
being created and you, I mean, it's, it's 10 years. I'll go ahead and spoil it. Glados is

990
01:28:05,640 --> 01:28:11,880
a potato. So you go around and you listen to old recordings of cave Johnson, which are absolutely

991
01:28:11,880 --> 01:28:18,680
hilarious and brilliant. Um, and of course we have Jonathan Golden still doing, uh, the end

992
01:28:18,680 --> 01:28:28,920
song for the game. Um, the other thing about this one too, is, uh, it had a bunch of AR games, uh,

993
01:28:29,880 --> 01:28:38,840
that promoted it, including one called, uh, potato stack where, sorry, potato sack where, um,

994
01:28:41,080 --> 01:28:48,360
you had to solve puzzles, uh, that showed up in, uh, in these different 13 updates. So, um,

995
01:28:49,880 --> 01:28:56,200
but going back to this portal to also, uh, had other things going on for it. So we're

996
01:28:56,200 --> 01:29:02,360
going to start back off with, you know, the essence of portal speedy thing goes in speedy

997
01:29:02,360 --> 01:29:12,280
thing goes out. It's physics. Um, so, uh, Oh, and yes, uh, uh, cave Johnson was, uh,

998
01:29:12,280 --> 01:29:20,440
voiced by J K Simmons who, uh, we might also know as J Jonah Jamison from our, uh, McGuire era

999
01:29:20,440 --> 01:29:26,520
Spider-Man movies. I believe so. Um, modern Spider-Man, the modern ones. Okay. Yeah. I

1000
01:29:26,520 --> 01:29:30,760
thought it was a other era because this goes to show, I haven't seen a single one of the new ones.

1001
01:29:30,760 --> 01:29:39,240
Um, so anyway, um, you have, uh, many different elements in this one apart from just, you know,

1002
01:29:39,240 --> 01:29:49,080
the, uh, the, the weighted storage cubes and the portal guns and, um, the, uh, you know,

1003
01:29:49,080 --> 01:29:56,520
the portals themselves, what you have are thermal discouragement beams, which are lasers,

1004
01:29:57,240 --> 01:30:03,560
um, excursion funnels, which are tractor beams and hard light bridges that you can all direct

1005
01:30:03,560 --> 01:30:11,800
through your portals. Aerial faith plates exist as well, which can launch you or objects into

1006
01:30:11,800 --> 01:30:16,520
portals. Basically you just throw them on there. You do still have the turrets and they are still

1007
01:30:16,520 --> 01:30:24,120
adorable. Um, as far as those redesigned weighted storage cubes, you now have redirection cubes

1008
01:30:24,120 --> 01:30:30,120
that are prismatic and let you redirect the thermal discouragement beams. Um, you have

1009
01:30:30,120 --> 01:30:41,160
spherical edgeless safety cubes, um, which are basically round storage cubes, um, and a poor,

1010
01:30:41,240 --> 01:30:51,000
poor cube turret hybrid that Wheatley made and prominently fucked up on. Um, you also do have

1011
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:59,320
a return of the weighted companion cube. Um, you also have, um, pneumatic diversity vents,

1012
01:31:00,440 --> 01:31:08,120
um, that have, uh, transport power, basically suction or transport. Um, those were actually

1013
01:31:08,120 --> 01:31:16,760
in the demo, but were not included in the final game. Um, as far as other things that you get,

1014
01:31:16,760 --> 01:31:25,640
um, again, this is something that was, uh, inspired by, uh, uh, by, uh, other games and tech

1015
01:31:25,640 --> 01:31:31,320
demos. I'll have to get into that in a second, but you get the various kinds of gels. So you have an

1016
01:31:31,320 --> 01:31:37,800
orange propulsion gel that will let you slide across surfaces quickly. You have repulsion gel

1017
01:31:37,800 --> 01:31:46,360
that makes you bounce and white conversion gel that allows a surface to accept portals because,

1018
01:31:46,360 --> 01:31:57,720
um, ground up, uh, moon rocks are poison and now he's deathly ill. Um, you have, uh, you also have

1019
01:31:57,720 --> 01:32:05,160
the various funnels that you can use to make it go across in the air or go, um, you know,

1020
01:32:05,160 --> 01:32:13,000
through the ground, um, like pull one, one direction versus the other. Uh, and then we also

1021
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:26,120
have the addition of multiplayer. So, um, so you can in single player, you can play Chell, um, who

1022
01:32:26,120 --> 01:32:33,320
is the main protagonist. Um, there was also a rumor that there was supposed to be like a sister

1023
01:32:33,400 --> 01:32:40,360
character for her who was supposed to be blonde. Um, that did not happen. Um,

1024
01:32:42,040 --> 01:32:51,320
so this takes us then to cooperative mode. So with cooperative mode, you can play as one of two

1025
01:32:51,320 --> 01:32:58,840
robots. Um, and see, this is where the, the Chell clone was supposed to come from. Um, so you have,

1026
01:32:58,840 --> 01:33:07,240
uh, two new robots, you have, uh, Atlas and Peabody as in P dash body. And they do also

1027
01:33:07,240 --> 01:33:14,520
make a cameo in the single player, uh, campaign. If you are quick and you have to be quick to see

1028
01:33:14,520 --> 01:33:23,400
them. Um, but you, you have like signals and pings and stuff, you know, which actually I wonder if

1029
01:33:23,400 --> 01:33:27,480
that's kind of where dead by daylight might've gotten some of that or from journey, maybe

1030
01:33:27,480 --> 01:33:32,440
where since survivors can't really talk to each other unless you're, you know, in discord or

1031
01:33:32,440 --> 01:33:40,600
something, you signal things so they can ping each other and signal, um, to state their intent. Um,

1032
01:33:42,120 --> 01:33:49,800
their, the writing in this is absolutely astounding. I mean, it's so good. So good.

1033
01:33:49,800 --> 01:34:00,440
Voice acting is so good. Um, the, the only thing, um, that there was a problem going on is that

1034
01:34:00,440 --> 01:34:06,920
there was a very, and I'm just going to say it out, Raul, a very, uh, rapey scene that, um,

1035
01:34:08,040 --> 01:34:13,560
it actually was voiced, uh, Ellen McClain did her, her part of it as GLaDOS. Well, not as GLaDOS,

1036
01:34:13,560 --> 01:34:23,080
but as, uh, um, why can't I think of her name, um, as the human person that GLaDOS is based off of,

1037
01:34:23,720 --> 01:34:34,120
um, like for like just a moment, my brain absolutely cannot remember her name anyway.

1038
01:34:34,200 --> 01:34:44,680
Um, but at any rate, um, uh, the cave Johnson lines, um, basically, uh, JK Simmons refused

1039
01:34:44,680 --> 01:34:55,240
to record them. Um, so that's very, uh, very cringy. Um, why can't I remember her name?

1040
01:34:57,960 --> 01:35:01,640
This is going to really bother me now because I can't remember her name.

1041
01:35:02,280 --> 01:35:08,760
Mike Deft is suggesting Miranda. No, it's not Miranda. It's, um, okay, screw it. I'm going

1042
01:35:08,760 --> 01:35:16,120
to look up her name. Uh, looking at chat for some other comments, um, tiger claw pointing out portal

1043
01:35:16,120 --> 01:35:19,960
two was one of the first games that was kind of cross platform. You buy the PlayStation three

1044
01:35:19,960 --> 01:35:24,680
version and it gives you the PC version and you sign into your steam account in the PC or PS3

1045
01:35:24,680 --> 01:35:28,120
version. Yeah. I remember that. That was really cool. So the only game that did that.

1046
01:35:28,120 --> 01:35:38,200
Okay. So, um, so get ready to catch me. It still is not, uh, she was, um, Caroline.

1047
01:35:40,200 --> 01:35:46,040
That was your name was Caroline. Yep. Yep. Um, and I knew it didn't start with an M.

1048
01:35:47,400 --> 01:35:56,280
Um, but at any rate, I mean, it's just so well done and I love Stephen merchant so much,

1049
01:35:56,280 --> 01:36:03,720
especially as, uh, um, Wheatley, I mean, it just made everything. Everything was so wonderful

1050
01:36:03,720 --> 01:36:13,880
about that game. Um, so, um, it also has been used, um, in education, uh, believe it or not.

1051
01:36:13,880 --> 01:36:19,880
Um, there was called teach with portals and steam for school that use portal to,

1052
01:36:19,880 --> 01:36:26,200
important to puzzle maker for education. Um, it was free, but it had a single player campaign

1053
01:36:26,200 --> 01:36:33,720
and puzzle maker was only for steam for school users. Um, so it was teaching how to solve puzzles

1054
01:36:33,720 --> 01:36:41,720
and create critical thinking. Although some people were, um, upset with the whole quote,

1055
01:36:41,720 --> 01:36:49,480
gamification of learning. So, um, and they, uh, there was also research in 2016 that demonstrated

1056
01:36:49,480 --> 01:36:55,560
that the portal to puzzle maker can be used to measure fluid intelligence. Um, so, and it was

1057
01:36:55,560 --> 01:37:05,480
referred to as the portal to test battery. Hmm. So that was also pretty neat. Um, it was, I mean,

1058
01:37:05,480 --> 01:37:12,680
it, it sold amazingly well people to this day still love and play it. Um, and it actually

1059
01:37:13,480 --> 01:37:22,680
was subject to, um, some mods. Um, so remember I was saying that Chell was supposed to have

1060
01:37:22,680 --> 01:37:29,960
like a twin or a clone or something. Her name was Mel. And so, um, someone did portal stories, Mel,

1061
01:37:30,680 --> 01:37:39,880
um, where they did, uh, a mod for portal where you could have Mel and Chell. Um,

1062
01:37:39,880 --> 01:37:45,640
there's aperture tag, the paint gun testing initiative, where it's a single player

1063
01:37:45,640 --> 01:37:53,160
modification, um, that basically replaces the portal gun with a gel gun. Um, that makes it

1064
01:37:53,160 --> 01:37:58,840
kind of like tag, the power of paint, which tag, the power of paint is where those gels were

1065
01:37:58,840 --> 01:38:05,320
originated. Um, and that game may come up cause I've done an arbacular drop. So, um, there's also

1066
01:38:05,320 --> 01:38:13,240
thinking with time machine, um, which is, uh, a, uh, mod that gives you the ability to record

1067
01:38:13,240 --> 01:38:18,840
actions that can be played back by a duplicate player, um, and allows for the use of a second

1068
01:38:18,840 --> 01:38:23,320
set of portals. And then there's portal reloaded, which is, um, a single player mod for portal two,

1069
01:38:24,040 --> 01:38:30,440
um, that came out on my birthday this year, cause the game came out on my birthday in, uh,

1070
01:38:30,440 --> 01:38:37,880
10 years ago. And it lets you use a third portal called the time portal to travel between the

1071
01:38:37,880 --> 01:38:48,360
present and future versions of each test chamber. And so on that note, I will say that portal two

1072
01:38:49,080 --> 01:38:55,480
deserves its place as a classic game and is still among one of my favorite modern classics.

1073
01:38:56,120 --> 01:39:02,760
I think it was definitely just a matter of when this game would be eligible, which it may be the

1074
01:39:02,760 --> 01:39:08,040
biggest surprise in this segment is that yes, this game is 10 years old and you are 10 years older.

1075
01:39:10,040 --> 01:39:15,240
Uh, and it's now eligible. It came out on my birthday. Yeah. Uh, and just somebody in chat

1076
01:39:15,240 --> 01:39:21,240
pointed out, uh, it was, uh, who said it? Uh, Oh yeah. Mike Deaf said, by the way, portal two

1077
01:39:21,240 --> 01:39:26,280
launched during that big Sony hack. Yeah. This was during that period when, um, PlayStation three,

1078
01:39:26,280 --> 01:39:32,600
uh, it was offline, I think for a pretty good chunk of the period. Um, you know, I do have

1079
01:39:32,600 --> 01:39:39,800
potato potatoes quotes. Okay. Um, still as my ring, ringtones on, uh, on my phone,

1080
01:39:40,360 --> 01:39:47,160
like my favorite one, look at you flying like an E flying majestically like an Eagle piloting a

1081
01:39:47,160 --> 01:39:56,120
blimp. Glados is the queen of reads the queen of the shady read. The library is always open with

1082
01:39:56,120 --> 01:40:01,240
her. You know, uh, thank you for bringing portal to, of course, this is the game we talked about.

1083
01:40:01,240 --> 01:40:04,520
I mean, it's funny cause you know, the show has been around long enough where we talked a lot

1084
01:40:04,520 --> 01:40:08,200
about this game when it came out and somebody in chat reminded us, this was our game of the year

1085
01:40:08,200 --> 01:40:15,960
in 2011. Like obviously, um, this is an amazing game. I have to say what, why, why will, why won't

1086
01:40:15,960 --> 01:40:21,000
valve do portal three? It's so disappointing that they won't do a third game because they

1087
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:27,720
can't count to three. I, I get, I realize this is valves mo, but I mean, I love this game in a way

1088
01:40:27,720 --> 01:40:32,040
that, you know, I don't have the same feelings about like, you know, half life and stuff like

1089
01:40:32,040 --> 01:40:37,640
that, that, which yes, I realize this has been awful, but I don't have, you know, this is the

1090
01:40:37,640 --> 01:40:42,120
one I really want to see a three of. And it's just, it's, it's blows my mind that yeah, at

1091
01:40:42,120 --> 01:40:48,440
least there was a half-life Alex, which is for some folks is a half-life three. When are we ever

1092
01:40:48,440 --> 01:40:57,560
going to see this series continue? Well, and we, we, uh, I just think that, uh, I almost said

1093
01:40:57,560 --> 01:41:05,080
aperture. Um, I think valve needs to go talk to whoever at Capcom learned how to count to three

1094
01:41:05,080 --> 01:41:14,120
and teach them how to count. If Capcom could do it, so can valve. Uh, orange, right. And chat

1095
01:41:14,120 --> 01:41:18,760
says portal VR wouldn't work. No, I absolutely agree with that. Uh, and I realized, you know,

1096
01:41:18,760 --> 01:41:23,880
a lot of valves interests, oh, make everybody vomit. Like, you know, even I enjoy VR and,

1097
01:41:23,880 --> 01:41:28,040
and it would still make me vomit. Like it would be too much. Would totally play it. I would totally

1098
01:41:28,040 --> 01:41:33,000
play it. And I, you know, you know, I'm sure somebody's already modded the first two games

1099
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:40,600
to work with VR, um, have fun, but you know, not, not so much for me. Um, but yeah, it's just,

1100
01:41:40,600 --> 01:41:47,160
it's so sad that, you know, I don't know, maybe they just figured they cannot top this game.

1101
01:41:47,160 --> 01:41:52,360
And I suppose that's something I just have to accept as a fan is that they cannot top this game.

1102
01:41:52,920 --> 01:41:58,040
And so they're not going to try. And it's that, but it's just, damn, I really wish this,

1103
01:41:58,040 --> 01:42:07,320
this universe could continue, you know? Yeah. Uh, Bobby does say there is a officially endorsed

1104
01:42:07,320 --> 01:42:15,960
portal VR game. It's portal, a portal stories VR. So. All right. And it is not portal.

1105
01:42:17,960 --> 01:42:21,880
It's just endorsed. All right. Uh, but anyway, yeah, I'd love to see a full portal three,

1106
01:42:21,880 --> 01:42:26,840
but I think I just kind of have to accept, uh, valve does not feel this can ever be talked. And

1107
01:42:26,840 --> 01:42:31,240
I guess that is that. So, all right. But great pick for the classic game of the week.

1108
01:42:31,240 --> 01:42:35,960
Love portal to love the original love this one, uh, portal to your classic game of the week.

1109
01:42:35,960 --> 01:42:42,840
Yes. It's 10 years old. All right. You're welcome. Uh, tiger claw does also remind us,

1110
01:42:42,840 --> 01:42:48,600
uh, a few weeks ago, I read that JJ Abrams said a portal movie is in the works. I remember hearing

1111
01:42:48,600 --> 01:42:55,960
about that recently too. Um, I believe nothing until I see it. I think the fandom is going to

1112
01:42:55,960 --> 01:43:02,360
be very irritated when Ella McLean is not the voice of GLaDOS. Like, I think there's just a

1113
01:43:02,360 --> 01:43:08,360
lot of fans. If she is, then I think we have a different conversation. Absolutely. But I think

1114
01:43:08,360 --> 01:43:12,520
there's a lot of people that are going to reject this movie when they put some AAA actress as the

1115
01:43:12,520 --> 01:43:17,400
voice of GLaDOS instead, but we'll see. I don't know. Maybe they will. Hey, if they did get Ella

1116
01:43:17,400 --> 01:43:24,520
McLean to do it, I'd be thrilled. She deserves it. I do have to point out when we got the

1117
01:43:24,600 --> 01:43:30,040
transformers movie, who else was our optimist prime? Yeah, it was Leonard Nimoy, right?

1118
01:43:30,600 --> 01:43:39,160
No, Leonard Nimoy was Galvatron in the animated movie. I'm talking about the more recent ones.

1119
01:43:40,200 --> 01:43:44,040
I forget who did do it. Was it, uh, not Frank Welker.

1120
01:43:48,360 --> 01:43:53,240
Well, who did my headphones go out? I think, I think so. Who did do it? I don't know.

1121
01:43:53,800 --> 01:44:02,360
You brought it up. No, it was Peter Cullen. Oh, that's right. Frank Welker was someone else.

1122
01:44:03,800 --> 01:44:09,080
Oh, Dark Tetsuya does remind, they got her to be in Pacific Rim, right? Oh yeah. I forgot that

1123
01:44:09,080 --> 01:44:15,080
was a thing, but you know, it'll be interesting to see if they, but I just, I cannot envision GLaDOS

1124
01:44:15,080 --> 01:44:19,880
without Ella McLean. I just can't do it. And I know this happens in Hollywood all the time that

1125
01:44:19,880 --> 01:44:26,360
they would recast it, but I just, I don't know. So, all right. Anyhow. All right. Thank you for

1126
01:44:26,360 --> 01:44:30,200
the classic Game of the Week. We've talked plenty about Portal, but it is such a good game. Let's

1127
01:44:30,200 --> 01:44:34,280
get into some rapid fire news, travel around the world and quickly check out some other headlines

1128
01:44:34,280 --> 01:44:43,080
from around the globe. Loki. All right. So there's been a delay with another game because of COVID

1129
01:44:43,080 --> 01:44:48,120
and this game of course is going to be King of Fighters 15, which is delayed now to 2022.

1130
01:44:48,840 --> 01:44:53,320
And I mean, this is, we've heard this a million times already, but

1131
01:44:53,320 --> 01:44:56,040
yet another one you'll have to wait a little bit longer for.

1132
01:44:58,360 --> 01:45:03,080
This is pretty cool. So relatively new game. EA has this game called Knockout City,

1133
01:45:03,080 --> 01:45:08,840
which is a massive multiplayer kind of a dodge ball game. And they've already seen

1134
01:45:08,840 --> 01:45:12,920
5 million account signups across all their platforms since launch,

1135
01:45:13,800 --> 01:45:17,480
which is pretty impressive considering it launched, you know, not that long ago.

1136
01:45:17,480 --> 01:45:20,600
I have some friends that talk about this game a lot and want me to play it. I just haven't gotten

1137
01:45:20,600 --> 01:45:24,280
around to it yet, but I probably will check it out. Aside from the trailer that we saw during

1138
01:45:24,280 --> 01:45:29,480
that one Nintendo Direct, I haven't really checked it out yet. It is apparently on Games Pass as

1139
01:45:29,480 --> 01:45:34,600
well. So that's one way to check it out. Oh yeah. Cause EA play is on Game Pass. So that's one way

1140
01:45:34,600 --> 01:45:40,200
to check it out. So yeah, I need to get around to anybody in chat playing this game. Part of that

1141
01:45:40,200 --> 01:45:46,840
5 million. Legend of Zaku says it's the next Fortnite. It might be that next, I don't know,

1142
01:45:46,920 --> 01:45:51,400
Fortnite is going to kind of always do its own thing, I think. Because Fortnite, remember,

1143
01:45:51,400 --> 01:45:55,480
Fortnite isn't a game. Remember? There was that whole thing that came out of the recent,

1144
01:45:55,480 --> 01:46:03,320
you know, headlines of Epic and all that. I think that there's games that kind of come and go with

1145
01:46:03,320 --> 01:46:08,200
the popular, like Fall Guys, Among Us. And not to say those games aren't still popular. There's

1146
01:46:08,200 --> 01:46:11,880
lots of people that love them, but they certainly, right, they were the front page, Twitch and all

1147
01:46:11,880 --> 01:46:15,480
that stuff. And I think Knockout City is kind of like, if it's not there yet, it's going to be one

1148
01:46:15,480 --> 01:46:20,680
of those big games pretty soon here as more and more people are checking it out. So.

1149
01:46:22,360 --> 01:46:27,640
Bonz006 says, I see the game, but and a Knockout City. Pastelpaca says, I've played it a bit. It's

1150
01:46:27,640 --> 01:46:33,640
fun, but in regards to dodgeball inspired games, I prefer Robot Roller Derby Disco Dodgeball. See,

1151
01:46:33,640 --> 01:46:38,120
nothing is going to top the Kunio Kun Super Dodgeball for me. That's just the reality.

1152
01:46:38,920 --> 01:46:41,880
That will always be the best dodgeball game. You're not going to be able to change my mind.

1153
01:46:42,840 --> 01:46:48,120
The Neo Geo, I mean, they had the NES one as well, which is all right. But the Neo Geo one is like

1154
01:46:48,120 --> 01:46:54,280
classic. So. All right. That's the whole reason to get a Neo Geo cabinet is play that game again.

1155
01:46:54,280 --> 01:47:03,480
All right. Anyhow. Sorry. I digress. Dark Saga. So for Pride Month, the game Tell Me Why is free

1156
01:47:03,800 --> 01:47:11,960
on Steam. So for the entire month of June, you can go download it so that you can experience

1157
01:47:13,720 --> 01:47:22,200
the story for yourself of one of the characters in the game is transgender. And so it will,

1158
01:47:22,840 --> 01:47:28,120
it's good to sort of put yourself in that person's shoes, especially since this has been

1159
01:47:28,120 --> 01:47:37,080
this year so far, there have been more than 100 bills passed restricting the rights of

1160
01:47:37,080 --> 01:47:43,400
transgender people. So definitely give this one a play. I believe it may also be free in the Xbox

1161
01:47:43,400 --> 01:47:46,520
ecosystem as well, because I was looking at the store the other day and it said, but I don't know

1162
01:47:46,520 --> 01:47:53,480
if that was a game pass thing, but just a heads up, it may be free there as well. Okay. And then

1163
01:47:53,960 --> 01:48:00,920
Arcade went up, put out a teaser, a very pixelated pink sprinkled donuts,

1164
01:48:02,120 --> 01:48:11,080
which is basically a big reference to them doing a Simpsons game. So you wanted Simpsons 4 player,

1165
01:48:11,080 --> 01:48:19,240
you're getting Simpsons 4 player. And Simpsons is on there. The other games that were in the

1166
01:48:19,240 --> 01:48:23,320
leak that we talked about what a couple of weeks ago, two weeks ago when we were last live, yeah,

1167
01:48:23,320 --> 01:48:28,120
probably going to be included. We'll see, which was Tron and PAW Patrol, which I'm sure some

1168
01:48:28,120 --> 01:48:37,240
people are very excited about, but also breaking news before OLR tonight. Bobby caught this on his

1169
01:48:37,240 --> 01:48:43,320
show is that apparently the entire YouTube trailer for the Simpsons machine leak. So it's,

1170
01:48:43,320 --> 01:48:48,920
it's happening. The Simpsons machine is absolutely 100% happening. The YouTube is out there.

1171
01:48:49,720 --> 01:48:56,200
You can't, no take backsies on that one. Now we are inferring that because, well, the leak for the

1172
01:48:56,200 --> 01:49:02,680
Simpsons was true then also, but we don't have a full YouTube yet for the Tron thing, but Arcade

1173
01:49:02,680 --> 01:49:08,360
went up is one of the virtual exhibitors at E3. So this would be a great time for them to put out

1174
01:49:08,360 --> 01:49:13,960
that trailer in this next couple of weeks. So fingers and toes. Well, I mean, I'm already kind

1175
01:49:13,960 --> 01:49:18,920
of like, you know, having my God damn it moment because, you know, I'm going to have to shell out

1176
01:49:18,920 --> 01:49:24,600
the money for that cabinet, but I'm not going to lie. I want that fucking cabinet. So there you

1177
01:49:24,600 --> 01:49:30,200
have it. Well, you know what else leaked out though on Twitter with all that stuff. Apparently

1178
01:49:30,200 --> 01:49:37,000
there is a countertop. So it's the smaller machine, but a super Pac-Man. Now super Pac-Man is in like

1179
01:49:37,000 --> 01:49:42,440
the Pac-Man 40th edition cabinet or all that stuff. But I love me some super Pac-Man. I'm

1180
01:49:42,440 --> 01:49:45,720
almost tempted to get that countertop, to be honest. I don't even know what other games are in it.

1181
01:49:46,680 --> 01:49:54,280
But at least the countertops are smaller. So there is that. Yeah. Fifth Dream in chat says,

1182
01:49:54,280 --> 01:49:58,920
I really want to get that Tron machine and really LED it up. Yeah. Those like, you know,

1183
01:49:58,920 --> 01:50:05,880
you know who is really attracted to the lights on the cabinets is Mr. Smoosh, my cat. So I actually

1184
01:50:05,880 --> 01:50:11,480
had grandpa from Hoard House was over here at the house over the weekend. We were hanging out for a

1185
01:50:11,480 --> 01:50:16,120
little bit and I was showing him the arcade cabinet because it'd been so long since he'd

1186
01:50:16,120 --> 01:50:21,160
been here, right? Cause the pandemic, I got that machine about a year ago when the pandemic was in

1187
01:50:21,160 --> 01:50:25,640
full swing for my birthday. So I showed him the cabinet and I turned it on. And as soon as the

1188
01:50:25,640 --> 01:50:30,520
light on that machine went on, I hadn't turned it on in a while. As soon as it turned on, Mr. Smoosh

1189
01:50:30,520 --> 01:50:35,560
was in Matt's lap. And then all of a sudden Smoosh like looks at the machine, his eyes get gigantic.

1190
01:50:35,560 --> 01:50:40,840
And then he like hops his way over to the machine and jumps up on the controls to like press his

1191
01:50:40,840 --> 01:50:48,200
face against the LED screen. Like I guess Mr. Smoosh loves himself in arcade cabinets. So

1192
01:50:48,200 --> 01:50:51,080
he's going to have two of them pretty soon when that Tron one shows up.

1193
01:50:51,800 --> 01:50:58,120
So yeah, he just better not ruin that special Tron joystick. Cause you know, you can't have

1194
01:50:58,120 --> 01:51:02,280
the Tron machine without that special joystick. I don't even know what to call it. I have like

1195
01:51:02,280 --> 01:51:09,240
that trigger finger thing is very cool. Yeah. All right. Yeah. It's that thing. That thing,

1196
01:51:09,240 --> 01:51:13,320
the Tron joystick. All right. Let's travel around the world and check out release dates.

1197
01:51:13,320 --> 01:51:16,040
I think I heard we have a big week this week, right? Loki?

1198
01:51:17,240 --> 01:51:22,600
We have a few things coming out. So it looks like we've got Chivalry 2 on PC, PlayStation

1199
01:51:22,600 --> 01:51:30,280
4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One and Xbox Series X, Edge of Eternity on PC, Neptunia Reverse

1200
01:51:30,280 --> 01:51:36,920
on PlayStation 5, Alba, A Wildlife Adventure on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5,

1201
01:51:36,920 --> 01:51:43,480
Xbox One and Xbox Series X, No More Heroes and No More Heroes 2, Desperate Struggle coming to

1202
01:51:43,480 --> 01:51:51,000
PC. We have Phantasy Star Online, New Genesis, I'm sorry, Phantasy Star Online 2, New Genesis,

1203
01:51:51,000 --> 01:51:57,720

1204
01:51:57,720 --> 01:52:06,280
PlayStation 4 in Japan. Chicory, A Colorful Tale on PC, Mac, PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5.

1205
01:52:07,560 --> 01:52:15,400
Looks like we've got Final Fantasy 7 Remake Integrate on PlayStation 5, Ninja Gaiden Master

1206
01:52:15,400 --> 01:52:22,360
Collection on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. Nintendo Switch is getting Game

1207
01:52:22,360 --> 01:52:30,360
Builder Garage, Guilty Gear Strive on PC, PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5, Ratchet and

1208
01:52:30,360 --> 01:52:38,920
Clank Rift Apart on PlayStation 5. And I believe that's everything. All right, let's go to Japan

1209
01:52:38,920 --> 01:52:43,800
right now. Pack your bags. Coming out of Japan this week, Game Builder Garage also gets a release

1210
01:52:43,800 --> 01:52:50,040
in Japan this week. And that Ninja Gaiden Master Collection is also out in Japan this week. Those

1211
01:52:50,040 --> 01:52:55,640
both on the Nintendo Switch, of course. Looking at PlayStation 5, Japan also gets the Final Fantasy

1212
01:52:55,640 --> 01:52:59,000
7 Remake Integrate. Of course, you know, it's going to be the same time we get it here in the

1213
01:52:59,000 --> 01:53:04,600
US. That shouldn't be a big surprise to anybody. Also, Ratchet and Clank Rift Apart also getting

1214
01:53:04,600 --> 01:53:09,320
its Japanese release. Guilty Gear Strive also coming out this week. This is really one of those

1215
01:53:09,320 --> 01:53:13,800
rare weeks where it's like the release calendar is like exactly the same between the two countries,

1216
01:53:13,800 --> 01:53:19,000
to be honest. It's very similar. And then PlayStation 4 also has Guilty Gear Strive this

1217
01:53:19,000 --> 01:53:23,640
week. So check it out. How about Europe? I imagine it's going to be a broken record, but let's see.

1218
01:53:23,640 --> 01:53:28,200
How about Europe, DarkSakura? Yeah, pretty, pretty light. So on the 8th,

1219
01:53:28,200 --> 01:53:35,880
we have Descenders. We have Elder Scrolls Online Blackwood, Chivalry 2. On the 10th,

01:53:35,880 --> 01:53:41,640
we have Tour de France 2021. We are Football, which is actual football and not American football.

1221
01:53:42,680 --> 01:53:49,000
Final Fantasy 7 Remake Integrate. And on the 11th, we have the Persistence Enhanced,

1222
01:53:49,560 --> 01:53:52,920
Ratchet and Clank Rift Apart and Guilty Gear Strive.

1223
01:53:57,000 --> 01:54:02,760
All right, that's it. That's it. All right, let's move on. And we appropriately after what

1224
01:54:02,760 --> 01:54:06,440
Loki had said earlier tonight, I think Loki is going to update us on the Minecraft world, right?

1225
01:54:07,320 --> 01:54:15,240
Yeah, I actually follow this up a lot. So one of the more popular streamers and speed runners is

1226
01:54:15,320 --> 01:54:23,240
Dream. And not that long ago, he was accused of cheating in Minecraft speed runs, because

1227
01:54:23,960 --> 01:54:30,680
the percentage. So one of the strats that they use for speedrunning in Minecraft 116 now is the

1228
01:54:30,680 --> 01:54:35,800
Piglin Bartering, which you can drop gold in front of a Piglin, they'll, you know, trade you some

1229
01:54:35,800 --> 01:54:44,840
random item, and they use that to get ender pearls. And so he had manipulated the game in a way,

1230
01:54:44,840 --> 01:54:50,920
or the alleged, you know, they alleged originally that he manipulated the basically the randomness

1231
01:54:50,920 --> 01:54:57,240
of that. So he increased the percentage chance drop by modifying loop tables to drop those ender

1232
01:54:57,240 --> 01:55:05,320
pearls more often. And so then he denied it originally. And, you know, put out this long winded

1233
01:55:06,920 --> 01:55:12,040
analyst video where he had a statistician look at, you know, everything in the game and said,

1234
01:55:12,040 --> 01:55:17,000
Oh, no, it's not impossible that the percentage drops that he got, but it was like it was

1235
01:55:17,000 --> 01:55:21,320
ridiculous. Like he would be like the most luckiest person in the world to have that kind of

1236
01:55:21,320 --> 01:55:30,600
luck in the games. Well, come to find out, he admitted to in a pay spin saying that, yep, he

1237
01:55:30,600 --> 01:55:37,000
did cheat. He did put or create a modification to allow him to have better drops on those.

1238
01:55:37,640 --> 01:55:43,240
But he was using it for some other types of runs, like for his manhunt series and stuff like that.

1239
01:55:44,520 --> 01:55:52,440
But he accidentally left it on for six of his live streams for his speed runs. So

1240
01:55:54,440 --> 01:56:02,520
accidentally did that. But then, of course, you know, so I don't know, it's just ridiculous.

1241
01:56:03,080 --> 01:56:06,200
I don't know why he needed to do that. He's already a great speed runner.

1242
01:56:06,920 --> 01:56:11,960
Granted, he's not going to be he doesn't have the top spots anymore because they've been taken down.

1243
01:56:11,960 --> 01:56:19,000
But but just kind of ruins his credit. It's one of those things where he didn't know what to do

1244
01:56:19,000 --> 01:56:22,680
and he wasn't the best anymore. And it's unfortunate. You kind of hear these stories

1245
01:56:22,680 --> 01:56:29,080
sometimes where somebody is trying to well, you know, it's without going too late. I'm going to

1246
01:56:29,080 --> 01:56:33,240
open this can of worms. It's a lot of the accusations around the Billy Mitchell thing,

1247
01:56:34,040 --> 01:56:39,080
right? He's also pretty young. Oh, yeah, for sure. But I mean, it's a similar type of thing

1248
01:56:39,080 --> 01:56:43,640
when it's like if you believe Billy Mitchell is lying about everything. I'm not going there

1249
01:56:43,640 --> 01:56:49,160
tonight, but it's then you would say that it's a similar thing where if, you know, when you're

1250
01:56:49,160 --> 01:56:53,000
when you're not number one in the world anymore, you don't know what else to do and you have to

1251
01:56:53,000 --> 01:56:59,080
cheat to get your way back to number one. Right. Exactly. Look, look, look at the former president

1252
01:57:01,640 --> 01:57:06,360
willing to cheat to try to get back anyway. Yeah, I know. I know.

1253
01:57:07,880 --> 01:57:11,960
So originally, like they're saying, you know, the odds of like what he got was like something

1254
01:57:11,960 --> 01:57:17,720
that one points one in seven point five trillion odds. Obviously, that's ridiculous. But,

1255
01:57:18,520 --> 01:57:25,160
uh, you know, it is what it is. It's weird, though, like now he's also like taking down

1256
01:57:25,160 --> 01:57:29,640
that post. But obviously, people saw it in the Internet. So once it's on the Internet,

1257
01:57:29,640 --> 01:57:34,920
it's always on the Internet. Just weird. But yeah, that's just that's your that's catching

1258
01:57:34,920 --> 01:57:42,840
you up on your your Minecraft speedrunning drama there in non speedrunning drama. So Minecraft is

1259
01:57:42,840 --> 01:57:48,280
actually removed a shout out to 4chan because you may remember when you started Minecraft,

1260
01:57:48,280 --> 01:57:52,360
they have kind of little blurbs in the near the logo talking just like little funny things in

1261
01:57:52,360 --> 01:58:00,360
there. Well, one of them apparently had, you know, kind of a mention of V on there or movie

1262
01:58:01,240 --> 01:58:06,440
because that's one of the sub channels for 4chan. So they have now removed that from the game as

1263
01:58:06,440 --> 01:58:12,440
well. One other bigger update, though, 1.17, the brand new version is actually coming out on

1264
01:58:12,440 --> 01:58:16,680
Tuesday, which is pretty exciting. So they're adding lots of updates to that. Originally,

1265
01:58:16,680 --> 01:58:22,520
caves and cliffs was supposed to be a lot bigger and redesigning the whole cave generation into

1266
01:58:22,520 --> 01:58:27,480
the game. But it's a massive undertaking that they're actually splitting up into multiple

1267
01:58:27,480 --> 01:58:32,440
releases. So this next release is just adding some more blocks, adding some new mobs and stuff like

1268
01:58:32,440 --> 01:58:41,400
or new, I guess, passive mobs in the game. But 1.18 is going to like completely redesign the

1269
01:58:41,400 --> 01:58:45,320
cave generation stuff. It's going to be ridiculous, but that's not supposed to come out to holiday,

1270
01:58:45,320 --> 01:58:50,680
but still pretty cool. Yeah. When's when series X supposed to get some of those graphical upgrades

1271
01:58:50,680 --> 01:58:54,120
that like the Nvidia stuffs beginning? Because like when I watch your stream and like the water

1272
01:58:54,120 --> 01:58:58,840
effects and stuff, I'm like Dan or your your YouTube's water. I love the look of that. And

1273
01:58:58,840 --> 01:59:05,240
it's not in the series X version. No, that's OptiFine and BSL shaders. So that's included

1274
01:59:05,240 --> 01:59:11,400
with OptiFine usually. And it really doesn't take much to run that. It looks so nice.

1275
01:59:12,840 --> 01:59:19,160
Really like the way it looks. It does break some plugins I have like that. I if I wanted to do

1276
01:59:19,160 --> 01:59:23,800
different visualizations like they have stuff where you can, you know, for building farms and

1277
01:59:23,800 --> 01:59:28,120
things like that, you can see what the spawn area is and it will generate like a sphere around you

1278
01:59:28,120 --> 01:59:32,120
and stuff like that. I can't see any of that if I because I'm playing with shaders on,

1279
01:59:32,760 --> 01:59:35,720
I would have to switch it off. But I just don't use those.

1280
01:59:37,000 --> 01:59:43,320
All right. Let's move on and talk about this is a little more in the rumor category,

1281
01:59:43,320 --> 01:59:48,200
but this has been a source of spoilers before and I'm talking about Walmart Canada.

1282
01:59:48,200 --> 01:59:53,960
Remember when they completely ruined E3 one year? I think that was what, 2019? They completely

1283
01:59:53,960 --> 01:59:59,080
ruined E3, Walmart Canada with all these releases. Well, who knows if they're trolling

1284
01:59:59,080 --> 02:00:05,720
or what's going on? I don't know, but here it is. A listing popped up this week for Metroid on the

1285
02:00:05,720 --> 02:00:12,440
Nintendo Switch. And obviously it had fake box art. It wasn't real. It was literally like black

1286
02:00:12,440 --> 02:00:17,320
text that said Metroid on a white box, but it was there. There is no Metroid game on the Nintendo

1287
02:00:17,320 --> 02:00:22,440
Switch right now. It is interesting to note they didn't call it Metroid Prime 4. The reason why

1288
02:00:22,440 --> 02:00:27,160
I bring this up, there were already rumors, but we really kind of filed those in the,

1289
02:00:27,160 --> 02:00:31,720
okay, y'all, this is like, like, I don't even know if I believe this, but people are saying

1290
02:00:31,720 --> 02:00:36,440
that there may be a new 2D Metroid game that is locked, loaded, ready to go for Nintendo Switch,

1291
02:00:36,440 --> 02:00:42,440
and it's getting announced at E3. Some rumors say it's a Super Metroid remake in the vein of

1292
02:00:42,440 --> 02:00:49,240
Metroid Zero Mission. I love Metroid. I love 2D Metroid. I'm not holding my breath or setting

1293
02:00:49,240 --> 02:00:57,160
expectations because this is the rumor they try to get you with every time, but Walmart Canada

1294
02:00:57,160 --> 02:01:03,240
doing this just to troll, I don't know if I buy that either. This is a little bit, there's smoke

1295
02:01:03,240 --> 02:01:09,240
here and there might be a fire. How very un-Canadian of them. Exactly. Exactly. That

1296
02:01:09,240 --> 02:01:16,360
would not be very Canadian of them to pull a stunt like this. How very. So who knows?

1297
02:01:16,680 --> 02:01:23,880
Um, I suppose they could announce something at E3 or they might not, quite frankly, because it seems

1298
02:01:23,880 --> 02:01:28,920
that some of the prior rumors about things we were supposed to hear about at E3, like a Switch Pro,

1299
02:01:28,920 --> 02:01:33,800
may not actually be happening. So Nintendo may have flipped the entire fucking script this E3.

1300
02:01:33,800 --> 02:01:39,480
I don't know, but I think this is interesting. If we take the prior rumor as true that the

1301
02:01:39,480 --> 02:01:44,440
Metroid game on Switch is pretty much done and it's coming out sooner rather than later,

1302
02:01:46,760 --> 02:01:51,960
then this might be the surprise announcement at E3. We know Nintendo can announce games

1303
02:01:51,960 --> 02:01:57,320
and have them out on the market in six weeks. Garage Builder games. They just did it. Just

1304
02:01:57,320 --> 02:02:03,080
did it. So could Nintendo announce a game that they're going to put out by Labor Day?

1305
02:02:03,080 --> 02:02:10,040
Absolutely. It'll be interesting. I hope so. And yeah, Tiger Claw says it worked for the

1306
02:02:10,040 --> 02:02:14,360
Return of Samus. It can work. That's right. They did that too. So it could work for Super Metroid.

1307
02:02:14,360 --> 02:02:21,320
It sure could. Boy, oh boy, is that some holy text though, in my opinion. Super Metroid is

1308
02:02:21,320 --> 02:02:27,880
the best video game ever made, in my opinion. Period. End of sentence. For them to redo it,

1309
02:02:28,680 --> 02:02:36,920
that's a tall order. But honestly, Metroid Zero Mish, if Nintendo is doing it themselves,

1310
02:02:36,920 --> 02:02:42,680
their track record on the remakes are pretty darn good. It probably will be a great game.

1311
02:02:42,680 --> 02:02:46,840
It probably won't have all the same magic of the original, but I will probably enjoy the

1312
02:02:46,840 --> 02:02:51,400
experience start to finish and I will absolutely buy it. But again, I don't want to set the

1313
02:02:51,400 --> 02:02:56,120
expectation. If it's a new adventure, if it's something, fuck, if it's a repackaging of the

1314
02:02:56,120 --> 02:03:02,040
previous Metroid games, I'm still happy to be quite honest. So we'll see. All right.

1315
02:03:03,480 --> 02:03:10,840
Let's move on. Dark Sakura. So, you know, there's a game that everyone loves to hate on,

1316
02:03:10,840 --> 02:03:16,280
I guess, or loves to rib. And that is, of course, the Super Mario Brothers movie

1317
02:03:17,480 --> 02:03:27,560
that came out in 93 and basically was chopped and edited into, like, a bunch of crap.

1318
02:03:29,000 --> 02:03:34,600
If you've ever watched the documentary about the making of this movie, it is absolutely worth it,

1319
02:03:34,600 --> 02:03:40,440
and just to see what could have been. I mean, honestly, I think the realism factor is a little

1320
02:03:40,440 --> 02:03:46,520
bit too much, but it could have been some gritty stuff. So anyway, there is an extended cut of

1321
02:03:46,520 --> 02:03:55,160
Super Mario Brothers, and it's been there for years. People have been trying to compile all of

1322
02:03:55,160 --> 02:04:02,760
these different aspects of them, you know, found footage and things from the internet and things

1323
02:04:02,760 --> 02:04:12,360
that people put together and, you know, recovered footage. So this completed version was actually

1324
02:04:12,360 --> 02:04:19,160
done by Rocky Morton and Annabel Jankel. This is a version that was completed before

1325
02:04:19,800 --> 02:04:30,040
the final one had made it into the theaters. So it has been surfaced, called the Morton Jankel cut.

1326
02:04:30,040 --> 02:04:38,840
There's been more people in the Super Mario Brothers archive community and a restorationist

1327
02:04:38,840 --> 02:04:47,720
named Garrett Gilchrist who put together a re-edited, touched-up version of the movie,

1328
02:04:48,280 --> 02:04:55,800
and it is available out there on the internet for those in chat. I am going to link it to you

1329
02:04:55,800 --> 02:05:00,760
right this minute so you can watch it, preferably after you watch me stream after the show.

1330
02:05:03,240 --> 02:05:09,080
But there you go. Well, let's ask a real talk. I watched a little bit of it. Okay, I was going

1331
02:05:09,080 --> 02:05:14,520
to ask a real talk question. Who's going to watch it? Like, it's okay? You said you watched a little

1332
02:05:14,520 --> 02:05:22,280
bit of it. I started and then I had stuff to do. How was it so far? It was okay. I kind of didn't

1333
02:05:22,280 --> 02:05:27,640
know what I was watching, so I'll have to just sit more time with it when I haven't been drinking

1334
02:05:27,640 --> 02:05:31,480
and watch it. Yeah, and the reason why I pose that question is like, it's one of those things

1335
02:05:31,480 --> 02:05:34,680
where I'm like, okay, that's kind of neat that this exists, that someone put the time in the...

1336
02:05:34,680 --> 02:05:41,480
I'm not going to watch it. I think I also put the wrong link in chat. Let me try this again.

1337
02:05:42,440 --> 02:05:46,680
No, I did. That's the right one. That's a big old MP4. That's a big download. Watch your bandwidth.

1338
02:05:47,640 --> 02:06:00,280
Well, I mean, this is just the viewing of it. So I am... Let's see. MPEG4 file is 3.7 gigabytes.

1339
02:06:01,640 --> 02:06:07,800
That's not too bad. It says DVD part one, MP4, blah, blah, blah. Well, I'm going to download it.

1340
02:06:07,800 --> 02:06:12,840
Why not? I've got internet. SSJ100Matt says, maybe when I go to the DMV at some point,

1341
02:06:12,840 --> 02:06:17,240
I'll check it out. Yeah. Maybe I'll download it for my next flight. Who knows?

1342
02:06:18,360 --> 02:06:23,240
Well, Rob, you know my love of not great movies.

1343
02:06:23,800 --> 02:06:29,240
I know. I know. Well, I love not great movies too. Hello. How many times have I seen Showgirls?

1344
02:06:29,240 --> 02:06:32,040
I could quote that movie. It's so bad, it's good.

1345
02:06:32,040 --> 02:06:32,840
You don't know shit.

1346
02:06:35,800 --> 02:06:37,000
You are a whore, darlin'.

1347
02:06:37,000 --> 02:06:43,720
All right. Anyhow, let's move on. Loki.

1348
02:06:45,640 --> 02:06:55,240
So Valve is making some changes to Counter-Strike Go or CSGO, basically to try to combat some of

1349
02:06:55,240 --> 02:07:01,000
the trolling that goes along in the game and some of the cheaters, I guess. But right now,

1350
02:07:01,080 --> 02:07:08,200
the way Go stands is that a lot of features are available in the free-to-play version of that.

1351
02:07:08,200 --> 02:07:12,840
But apparently you can buy Prime, which allows you to have Prime-only matchmaking, item drops,

1352
02:07:12,840 --> 02:07:17,960
XP bonuses, and stuff like that. Along with some of those, they're saying that now they're going

1353
02:07:17,960 --> 02:07:25,080
to be kind of putting that behind that paywall to disincentivize folks from basically creating

1354
02:07:25,080 --> 02:07:30,120
accounts to troll and then, you know, with the intent that they may get banned and then creating

1355
02:07:30,120 --> 02:07:36,760
another free account and that type of stuff. So the rank ladder, they said right now, has a lot

1356
02:07:36,760 --> 02:07:45,640
of cheaters in it. And the high-ranked players are making new accounts to stump noobs and griefers

1357
02:07:45,640 --> 02:07:51,320
are creating accounts to potentially throw the game and trolls and whatnot. So they're trying to...

1358
02:07:52,440 --> 02:07:56,600
It's unfortunate that they're kind of hurting the community in the sense that, you know, there's

1359
02:07:56,600 --> 02:08:01,160
probably folks that want to try that out for free, but in order to try to combat some of the stuff

1360
02:08:01,160 --> 02:08:05,640
they're having to put it behind a paywall to try to make it a little bit harder to just create a

1361
02:08:05,640 --> 02:08:11,880
bunch of dummy accounts and also make them more money at the same time. Yeah, but I mean, like,

1362
02:08:11,880 --> 02:08:15,640
how much money is there to be made from Counter-Strike? How old is it? Well, I say that,

1363
02:08:15,640 --> 02:08:20,760
but obviously this game is still... Yeah, I guess that was a dumb thing now that the words have left

1364
02:08:20,760 --> 02:08:26,360
my mouth. But MMOs kind of have to do all this all the time to kind of prevent the

1365
02:08:26,440 --> 02:08:30,600
exploits and all this stuff. So I guess it's not... It's just more surprising it took this long.

1366
02:08:30,600 --> 02:08:38,120
The TLDR about it is basically before there used to be a way to earn Prime status by playing the

1367
02:08:38,120 --> 02:08:42,520
game long enough. Now you have to actually purchase it. There's no free path to Prime.

1368
02:08:44,680 --> 02:08:48,440
It would be easy to just stay logged in and rack up time that way, I'm sure,

1369
02:08:48,440 --> 02:08:51,160
or, you know, do private matches with other bots or something.

1370
02:08:51,160 --> 02:08:58,520
Something like that. Yeah. All right. Well, hey, since I bitch a lot about bandwidth and

1371
02:08:58,520 --> 02:09:04,120
exceeding it in this day and age, here's some news that is actually a great thing because this game

1372
02:09:04,120 --> 02:09:07,800
has a gigantic footprint. But you know what? It's one of those things where it's like,

1373
02:09:07,800 --> 02:09:12,600
I understand it because this game is so goddamn beautiful. And that's the new Microsoft Flight

1374
02:09:12,600 --> 02:09:19,000
Simulator. So kind of like the reboot of Flight Simulator that came out in the kind of last year,

1375
02:09:19,000 --> 02:09:27,080
I think it was, earlier in the year. The original install size has shrunk from 170 gigabytes,

1376
02:09:27,080 --> 02:09:33,960
yes, it was that big, to 83 gigabytes. So that's pretty awesome. And that's from notes on the most

1377
02:09:33,960 --> 02:09:39,880
recent patch in the game. We don't know exactly what they did. Obviously, they've optimized

1378
02:09:39,880 --> 02:09:45,400
something, but that's a hell of a lot of bandwidth to save. So they cut some corners somewhere,

1379
02:09:45,400 --> 02:09:50,120
you know, optimized graphics on another side or something. I don't know what they did.

1380
02:09:50,120 --> 02:09:56,600
But yeah, they've cut the footprint down a lot. This is also good knowing that the Xbox version

1381
02:09:56,600 --> 02:10:01,160
is out pretty soon. Have they dated the Xbox version? I don't think they have. They're just

1382
02:10:01,160 --> 02:10:05,000
saying it soon. Maybe we'll find out at E3. I bet that's one of those games we'll get updated on at

1383
02:10:05,000 --> 02:10:13,400
E3. And it'll be good that the print is smaller for the Xbox version because like 170 gigs on

1384
02:10:13,400 --> 02:10:18,360
that drive, you're eating so much install space for other games. You won't even be able to play

1385
02:10:18,360 --> 02:10:22,440
hardly anything else. So I think it's great that they're getting the footprint struck down for when

1386
02:10:22,440 --> 02:10:27,640
that comes out on Xbox. I'm excited to try it on Xbox because I think the controller and all that's

1387
02:10:27,640 --> 02:10:33,240
really gonna take a lot of the complications out of the game. I know you can do a lot to get,

1388
02:10:33,240 --> 02:10:37,880
but I think once they make the interface more controller friendly and for the Xbox audience,

1389
02:10:37,880 --> 02:10:44,840
I think I'm going to be able to get into it a lot more. It's beautiful. I've watched streamers

1390
02:10:44,840 --> 02:10:53,080
play the game and it's always a good experience. It really, really looks good. Legend of Zaku says

1391
02:10:53,080 --> 02:10:58,360
it's compression and lots of it. Bobby Blackwolf says it was out during Summer Games Done Quick

1392
02:10:58,360 --> 02:11:03,080
last year. Oh, I didn't realize it was that late in the year. I thought it was before the pandemic,

1393
02:11:03,080 --> 02:11:11,640
but I guess not. You know what? I know you're right, but it's one of those things where I

1394
02:11:11,640 --> 02:11:17,000
was only able to download it because Comcast suspended all the bandwidth caps at the beginning

1395
02:11:17,000 --> 02:11:23,080
of the pandemic. Remember that? So I was like 190 gigabyte install, who gives a shit? And I did it.

1396
02:11:23,080 --> 02:11:32,360
So you're right. It was that time. So, all right. Anyhow, let's see. Bonds006 says,

1397
02:11:32,360 --> 02:11:37,640
yeah, I saw 170 gigs and was like, that's a no for me. Granted, I have a 320 gig hard drive for

1398
02:11:37,640 --> 02:11:43,720
my PC games. Ooh, time to get three terabytes. So, all right. Anyway, I'm really looking forward

1399
02:11:43,720 --> 02:11:49,160
to the Xbox version of the game. I want to check that out. Yeah, Zaku says I bought a new one

1400
02:11:49,160 --> 02:11:55,400
terabytes solid state drive for the game because of the near 200 gigabyte size for it. Yeah, I bet

1401
02:11:55,400 --> 02:11:59,880
there's lots of people on the Xbox side of the house that are going to get a new drive so they

1402
02:11:59,880 --> 02:12:06,680
can put that game on it along with others. So, wow. August 17th, 2020. I can't believe it was

1403
02:12:06,680 --> 02:12:13,320
that late in the year. Wow. I would say time has just flown by, except it hasn't. It's been very

1404
02:12:13,320 --> 02:12:18,920
slow. All right. Anyhow, I think that was the last story we had on deck for tonight.

1405
02:12:18,920 --> 02:12:22,920
So, we're going to get into the listener roundtable, which includes our mailbag.

1406
02:12:22,920 --> 02:12:27,320
And Dark Soccer is going to hop on over there. Participate at orangelandradio.com if you want

1407
02:12:27,320 --> 02:12:31,560
to send us email, but please not if you're a spammer because unfortunately that is something

1408
02:12:31,560 --> 02:12:38,680
that's starting to rear its ugly head again. So, if you signed us up for that, choke. But we do

1409
02:12:38,680 --> 02:12:42,920
have, do we have any real emails this week? I thought we have one. Yay. One email. Let's get to

1410
02:12:42,920 --> 02:12:50,840
it. And it's a very simple email. Okay. It comes from Dee in Waterloo. Waterloo. Okay. Yes. I know

1411
02:12:50,840 --> 02:12:56,840
Waterloo. I said that because of your, you know, your ABBA thing. Waterloo. I'm sure the listener

1412
02:12:56,840 --> 02:13:08,760
has never heard that before. What is the most overused term in gaming? Toxic. Ooh. But it's

1413
02:13:08,760 --> 02:13:16,120
accurate. I'm playing so much Dead by Daylight that, you know. But you say it's accurate,

1414
02:13:16,120 --> 02:13:21,640
so does that really make it overused? They could come up with other words like asshole.

1415
02:13:23,960 --> 02:13:32,120
Asshole survivors. Or teabagging little shits. I'm going to say, I'll say one that's kind of

1416
02:13:32,120 --> 02:13:35,640
controversial and it's one I see in Dead by Daylight and I see it in a lot of games and I

1417
02:13:36,520 --> 02:13:40,920
think it's getting to be a little bit of a tired expression to the point where I think people use

1418
02:13:40,920 --> 02:13:48,840
it sometimes to be toxic. I'm going to say GG is overused. Really? Yeah. Well, it's just sort of

1419
02:13:48,840 --> 02:13:54,040
like a tradition now. Like just, you know, GGS or. I feel like if you want to, like it would mean

1420
02:13:54,040 --> 02:13:58,360
10 times more if you actually typed out good game and then I know you meant it. Because I think

1421
02:13:58,360 --> 02:14:02,840
there's some people that like, let's take Dead by Daylight for instance. They fucking wipe the

1422
02:14:02,840 --> 02:14:08,680
floor with the survivors. Then the killer puts GG, happy face. When it's like, bitch, you're

1423
02:14:08,680 --> 02:14:13,880
just saying that because you won, you know. I appreciate the ones that'll actually be up front

1424
02:14:13,880 --> 02:14:20,520
and say GG easy. Oh no, I think that's the worst when people say GG easy. At least I know that

1425
02:14:20,520 --> 02:14:26,520
they're being sarcastic shits. Okay, okay. So you know, okay. I get what you mean. It

1426
02:14:26,520 --> 02:14:28,040
quantifies it for me. Yes.

1427
02:14:30,920 --> 02:14:34,120
Oh, well, Loki, let me let you go. And then I'm going to read the chat because

1428
02:14:35,080 --> 02:14:43,000
chat said one. I'm like, oh, that's a good one too. Yeah, for me, it's always, well,

1429
02:14:43,560 --> 02:14:50,920
overused in our games at least is WB and TY because everyone logging on. Welcome back.

1430
02:14:51,720 --> 02:14:56,840
Thank you. I don't know. Um, I can't really think of anything that's like super overused

1431
02:14:56,840 --> 02:15:02,280
aside from, you know, pog. I guess poggers. I was going to say poggers too is I'm like,

1432
02:15:02,280 --> 02:15:07,400
I don't, I think it's like, I get it. Pogs were those little discs in the nineties.

1433
02:15:08,040 --> 02:15:11,640
No, no. Well, like I get what the meaning is, but I think it's like,

1434
02:15:12,280 --> 02:15:16,360
like everything is not pog. Like it's just like, you know, that could be cool, but it's not like,

1435
02:15:16,440 --> 02:15:18,280
Oh my God. It's voggers.

1436
02:15:24,840 --> 02:15:29,880
See, we could have gotten so much more traffic if we just called ourselves pog network.

1437
02:15:29,880 --> 02:15:34,360
Yeah. The, the, instead of the voice of geeks network, the, uh, pantomime of geeks network,

1438
02:15:34,360 --> 02:15:40,680
I guess, I don't know what other words starts with P is there a personification of geek.

1439
02:15:40,680 --> 02:15:44,600
There's gotta be a pog network. There are enemy.

1440
02:15:46,360 --> 02:15:49,480
I support all networks except that one. No, I'm just kidding. I don't even know

1441
02:15:49,480 --> 02:15:55,160
if there is a pog or what it, what they have. Anyway. Um, let's see some comments from chat.

1442
02:15:55,160 --> 02:16:01,400
Uh, Bobby black Wolf and Mike deaf both said F is the most overused thing. Yeah.

1443
02:16:01,400 --> 02:16:06,200
F F is a good one. Although I kind of liked that emoji. I know one of you has it. That's

1444
02:16:06,200 --> 02:16:13,080
like an F on a gravestone. That one's kind of funny. Um, Tiger claw says, how about LOL?

1445
02:16:13,080 --> 02:16:16,760
That's overused. I don't think that's unique to gaming. That's not gaming,

1446
02:16:16,760 --> 02:16:21,080
but I'm also guilty of it. I will admit I do sometimes look at my text and I'm like,

1447
02:16:21,080 --> 02:16:27,080
I say LOL a lot, but to me, I think sometimes when I say LOL, it's to kind of like emphasize

1448
02:16:27,080 --> 02:16:31,400
that like, I'm saying this in a positive way. Like I'm not saying this to be a Dick or something

1449
02:16:31,400 --> 02:16:39,640
like this or whatever. Like, you know, that's funny. LOL. I don't know. Um, let's see. I'm

1450
02:16:39,640 --> 02:16:45,000
looking, uh, fifth dream says thank you for your continued support and please look forward to it.

1451
02:16:45,000 --> 02:16:50,040
Meaning we fucked up. Thanks for not abandoning it and don't hold your breath respectively.

1452
02:16:52,120 --> 02:16:54,440
I like that. Or just anything on the roadmap.

1453
02:16:56,520 --> 02:17:03,400
All right. Oh, SSU 100. Matt has linked me to a Twitter account for pog network.

1454
02:17:04,680 --> 02:17:09,240
What I want to see what they do. They probably have like 10 times the followers. Oh no,

1455
02:17:09,240 --> 02:17:13,960
they only have 54 followers. Oh, they're league of legends streamers. All right, cool.

1456
02:17:14,840 --> 02:17:20,360
Poggers. All right. Well, there's, you know what, my cease and desist right now, because,

1457
02:17:20,360 --> 02:17:26,280
because they're a small network and they're not there, they haven't, uh, broke through in a way

1458
02:17:26,280 --> 02:17:31,800
and overused the way that acronym has. I'll say, all right, as long as you're not toxic shit bags

1459
02:17:31,800 --> 02:17:37,080
in league of legends, cause if you think dead by daylight's bad play a match of league of legends,

1460
02:17:37,080 --> 02:17:42,600
my God. So as long as y'all are keeping it positive, then I will say you don't have to

1461
02:17:42,600 --> 02:17:50,280
be our enemy anymore. Pog network. Okay. All right. I'll put it this way. I just had a few

1462
02:17:50,280 --> 02:17:55,880
people that I know who play survivor and I'm like, if you see a plague wearing this cosmetic,

1463
02:17:55,880 --> 02:18:03,480
be nice. Cause it might be you. Well, yeah. And as far as I know, I was watching,

1464
02:18:03,480 --> 02:18:07,240
I was watching somebody and they went up against a plague and somebody in chat said,

1465
02:18:07,240 --> 02:18:13,640
is this dark Sakura? And I was like, yeah, she's fucking everywhere. Well, no, it was,

1466
02:18:13,640 --> 02:18:19,960
it was a taste channel. Okay. It probably was taste channel. I told T I told T if you see a plague,

1467
02:18:19,960 --> 02:18:27,800
be nice. And then I said, uh, when I got back, he's like, we went against the plague, but I

1468
02:18:27,800 --> 02:18:33,640
don't think it was you. Cause you let, you let people find stuff and I was like, it probably

1469
02:18:33,640 --> 02:18:39,000
wasn't me. Um, and then I, I sent a picture of what my cosmetic looks like. There you go.

1470
02:18:39,000 --> 02:18:46,680
That's funny. Yeah. All right. Anyway. Um, all right. Uh, that's it for mailbag. Let's get to,

1471
02:18:46,680 --> 02:18:50,280
uh, do you have any last minute stories, Loki? And I'm going to, and if you guys have any questions

1472
02:18:50,280 --> 02:18:55,160
in chat, uh, please, please feel free to type away in chat. Uh, I will get as well to some of

1473
02:18:55,160 --> 02:18:59,400
our discord submissions for this week. Loki. Yeah. I did want to mention that there is that

1474
02:18:59,400 --> 02:19:04,280
bundle that's available on itch IO for support Palestine. Oh my God. We didn't put that in our

1475
02:19:04,280 --> 02:19:09,720
show. I'm so sorry. This wasn't for $5. So, you know, you know, it's a pretty good, that's a

1476
02:19:09,720 --> 02:19:15,800
pretty good price. So a thousand, I should say it's not all games, there's assets and stuff in

1477
02:19:15,800 --> 02:19:19,400
there too, but there's a lot of games in there. So, uh, check it out. And I know that there's

1478
02:19:19,400 --> 02:19:24,200
some nest maker games in there as well. Um, cause they posted that in our little, uh, community.

1479
02:19:25,480 --> 02:19:31,320
Yeah. Cool. Anything else? I haven't got the channel up yet here. I'm working on it.

1480
02:19:32,600 --> 02:19:38,120
I don't have anything. Yeah. I don't really have anything else that's worth mentioning.

1481
02:19:38,120 --> 02:19:43,960
I make sure we're going to have lots of stuff this week. In completely like not even news. Uh,

1482
02:19:44,760 --> 02:19:50,200
I learned that, that kind of John is on Tik TOK and that makes me happy cause she's adorable

1483
02:19:51,080 --> 02:19:58,360
as in the wrestler Oscar. How do I use Tik TOK? Like I have a Tik TOK and I posted one thing to it

1484
02:19:58,360 --> 02:20:02,360
Halloween of 2019 that looking back isn't even that funny. Like

1485
02:20:02,360 --> 02:20:08,440
how do I, what do I post on Tik TOK? I have four dead by daylight clips and then me watching

1486
02:20:08,440 --> 02:20:13,800
Oscar on TV. Okay. I guess I have seen a lot of Twitch streamers trying to like put clips from

1487
02:20:13,800 --> 02:20:18,120
their streams as Tik TOKs, which is interesting. I mean, I guess it's a good way to promote,

1488
02:20:18,120 --> 02:20:25,560
I guess that makes sense. Yeah. I only have a hand. I mean, my, my Tik TOK is I think dark

1489
02:20:25,560 --> 02:20:34,440
Sakura. I just need to do more streaming. Um, so I mean, if someone wants to hold on,

1490
02:20:34,440 --> 02:20:40,280
I'm actually going to see what the hell my Tik TOK is called. Uh, dark Sakura underscore O L R.

1491
02:20:40,280 --> 02:20:43,560
I'm pretty sure I'm Rob Roberts, but don't follow me. I don't post anything.

1492
02:20:44,440 --> 02:20:47,880
Y'all can follow me and then teach me the ways of the, the Tik TOKs.

1493
02:20:48,520 --> 02:20:53,240
Yeah. The Tik TOKs. The Tik TOKs. I love Tik TOKs.

1494
02:20:53,240 --> 02:20:59,400
More like Tik TOKs. Sorry. The only time I hear Tik TOK, I can only think of return to Oz.

1495
02:21:00,760 --> 02:21:07,160
Oh God. Yes. I think of, I think of, uh, catching fire. Tik TOK, Tik TOK.

1496
02:21:07,160 --> 02:21:11,000
You know, somebody I'm sure it's been done, but somebody needs to post that character,

1497
02:21:11,000 --> 02:21:14,840
Tik TOK from return to Oz on Tik TOK and say, Hey, I heard you like Tik TOKs.

1498
02:21:15,400 --> 02:21:19,080
Like surely has that been done? Surely someone did that. Someone did that, right?

1499
02:21:19,880 --> 02:21:24,360
Someone's going to be corny to do that. Yeah. All right. You know, I saw that in the theater, Rob.

1500
02:21:24,360 --> 02:21:27,880
Oh, so did I, I saw it at the, I saw it at the discount theater.

1501
02:21:28,600 --> 02:21:34,200
I saw it when it premiered. So for you locals, so we're based out of Sacramento, California,

1502
02:21:34,200 --> 02:21:37,480
and I know there's a few of you that are local that listen because you're kind of like,

1503
02:21:37,480 --> 02:21:40,680
it's really surreal to hear you guys talk about local places on the show. Well,

1504
02:21:40,680 --> 02:21:46,680
I've got one for you. Brace yourself. I saw return to Oz at the Harding cinema. Anyone

1505
02:21:46,680 --> 02:21:52,040
remember that out in Roseville, the Harding cinema, which I think turned into a radio

1506
02:21:52,040 --> 02:21:56,840
shack after they closed it. That's how big the Harding cinema was is that they turned it into a

1507
02:21:56,840 --> 02:22:02,600
radio shack, but it was like 99 cent matinees during the day. And that's where I saw return

1508
02:22:02,600 --> 02:22:10,600
to Oz. So. Hey, Rob, guess what I drove by today? Not today, but, uh, when Becky and I

1509
02:22:10,600 --> 02:22:15,640
were on our way to San Francisco yesterday, cause it's not for coffee. Crest View Lanes.

1510
02:22:15,640 --> 02:22:22,040
The sign is still there. Oh, oh, it's still there. The sign is the building is long gone.

1511
02:22:22,040 --> 02:22:26,840
I was gonna say they probably made condos over there by now, but the sign is still there. And

1512
02:22:26,840 --> 02:22:30,520
I wonder if they're just going to leave it up. Huh? I wonder, have they built anything in its

1513
02:22:30,520 --> 02:22:37,320
place yet or no, it's still a lot weird. Yeah. But Crest View is where like we would go play.

1514
02:22:37,320 --> 02:22:43,320
Dan and I would go play air guys and, and blazing star and sweet arcade. Yeah. Yeah. The arcade

1515
02:22:43,320 --> 02:22:48,040
there was pretty, pretty tops. And they had, uh, they had a DDR for a hot minute. You know what

1516
02:22:48,040 --> 02:22:54,280
arcade I haven't been to in centuries is, um, the 24 hour bowling alley. That's still there on what

1517
02:22:54,280 --> 02:23:02,360
country club? I thought the bowling alleys were all closed. It's orange. Uh, Sacramento got

1518
02:23:02,360 --> 02:23:07,160
promoted to orange, so they should have reopened because bowling alleys were, uh, in that. Unless

1519
02:23:07,160 --> 02:23:10,360
for whatever reason, they don't think they can follow COVID, but I think they would have reopened

1520
02:23:10,360 --> 02:23:17,720
by now. So I, since I've been there because I did the, you know, this was back a couple of years ago,

1521
02:23:17,720 --> 02:23:21,720
uh, at this point because of COVID, but we used to do the, uh, laser tag circuit.

1522
02:23:21,720 --> 02:23:27,320
And, uh, so we went there to play laser, uh, X because I haven't ever played laser X,

1523
02:23:27,320 --> 02:23:33,240
even though I used to go there all the time for DDR. Um, but they, yeah, they completely changed

1524
02:23:33,240 --> 02:23:37,880
up that. So they have two arcades now. Um, they have the original arcade. We used to play DDR in,

1525
02:23:37,880 --> 02:23:44,760
which is where they have like their oversized enormous giant, like cockpit games, which is

1526
02:23:44,760 --> 02:23:49,000
basically what everything is nowadays. So that your Jurassic parks, your giant nerve thing,

1527
02:23:49,000 --> 02:23:54,760
um, Mario Kart, um, and try to think what else, but like racing games and stuff like that.

1528
02:23:54,760 --> 02:24:00,120
Then they have a whole ticket section that's shoved way back, like it towards the back of

1529
02:24:00,120 --> 02:24:03,720
the building. And they've got a whole nother section with like tickets. That's where the,

1530
02:24:03,720 --> 02:24:07,320
that's where the nightclub used to be is where all the ticket spitters are. Yeah.

1531
02:24:07,320 --> 02:24:12,680
Yes. Freeze pop. I used to, I used to go to the club there.

1532
02:24:13,320 --> 02:24:16,840
Yeah. Freeze pop played there once. And now it's a, it's a room full of tickets,

1533
02:24:16,840 --> 02:24:23,000
spitters depressing face. I know. Right. All right. Uh, okay. Sorry. Sorry. We delved into

1534
02:24:23,000 --> 02:24:27,640
local chat, but you know what? I'm sure a lot of these stories, honestly, you could swap the names

1535
02:24:27,640 --> 02:24:32,440
of the places and the towns. They'd probably be very similar. All right. Anyway. Uh, so some of

1536
02:24:32,440 --> 02:24:36,360
y'all post stories throughout the week at our discord vog network.com slash discord. And I like

1537
02:24:36,360 --> 02:24:40,760
to read some of those, uh, tiger claw posted in our channel. I think this is funny. The director

1538
02:24:40,760 --> 02:24:45,400
of the tech and games is throwing shade at Sega and challenging the Virtua Fighter team to make

1539
02:24:45,400 --> 02:24:52,120
a new game. Make a new game. You cowards. Okay. He didn't say that, but he did make a video.

1540
02:24:53,400 --> 02:24:56,120
I would love it if he did actually, that'd be hilarious.

1541
02:24:56,120 --> 02:25:02,440
Katsuhiro Harada posted on his personal YouTube channel about a Virtua Five fighter ultimate

1542
02:25:02,440 --> 02:25:08,440
showdown coming out. And, uh, he's always viewed surpassing SEGA series as a professional goal.

1543
02:25:09,240 --> 02:25:15,800
I love that. And I'm on his side. Uh, tiger class says, if you're into collecting Funko pops,

1544
02:25:15,800 --> 02:25:20,840
they just announced a sly Cooper pop. Anyone, anyone collect those fun? I get them once in a

1545
02:25:20,840 --> 02:25:25,880
great while. In fact, right next to me. Well, I guess I don't, I thought I had it next to me,

1546
02:25:25,880 --> 02:25:31,720
but I guess not. I have a, a large, uh, Richard Simmons doll, but I had a Richard Simmons, um,

1547
02:25:32,520 --> 02:25:36,360
Funko pop and I couldn't pass it up. I have a collection of Deadpools.

1548
02:25:36,920 --> 02:25:44,440
Do you have mermaid Deadpool, Bob Ross, Deadpool, uh, barista Deadpool, um, scooter Deadpool,

1549
02:25:44,440 --> 02:25:48,200
because, uh, because it reminds me of my favorite cover for cable and Deadpool.

1550
02:25:49,320 --> 02:25:57,160
Um, it's the one where they try to redo the, uh, Acura one. And I have, I need the other two

1551
02:25:57,160 --> 02:26:03,640
golden girls, but I have, I have, I have significant pops. I have all the golden girls

1552
02:26:03,640 --> 02:26:08,840
over off camera. So, all right. Uh, let me do one more. And I know dark soccer, you go ahead,

1553
02:26:08,840 --> 02:26:12,120
dark soccer, if you're going to, if you need to bow out to sort some things before, uh,

1554
02:26:12,120 --> 02:26:17,560
after the show, uh, any final thoughts for our listeners tonight? Um, just, uh, don't be a

1555
02:26:17,560 --> 02:26:25,960
shithole. Um, just be a nice person, be kind and, uh, stay tuned for my stream. All right.

1556
02:26:25,960 --> 02:26:31,400
Have a good night. You do love everybody hearts. Bye. All right. Don't go anywhere just yet though,

1557
02:26:31,400 --> 02:26:34,520
folks. We've still got a little more. I've got a few more headlines I want to read for you guys

1558
02:26:34,520 --> 02:26:41,400
here. Uh, and that would be, uh, this one, apparently this leak is real. There is an

1559
02:26:41,400 --> 02:26:46,920
X-com style Avengers game coming from 2k. That sounds very interesting. Uh,

1560
02:26:48,920 --> 02:26:54,360
yeah, right. That could be very interesting. So, uh, we'll see. Hmm. Interesting. Anyway,

1561
02:26:54,360 --> 02:26:58,600
thanks you guys for sharing some of those headlines there over at, uh, our discord

1562
02:26:58,600 --> 02:27:04,680
channel, vognetwork.com slash discord. Um, w are we out of last minute stories, Loki?

1563
02:27:05,720 --> 02:27:09,880
I think so for now. Yeah. All right. All right. Let me see, let me see if I can sneak in one more

1564
02:27:09,880 --> 02:27:15,880
headline here then. Uh, let's see. Let's see. Let's see. Um, apparently some folks are talking

1565
02:27:15,880 --> 02:27:19,800
about that. It's a little bit of a pain in the butt to transfer your save over with final fantasy

1566
02:27:19,800 --> 02:27:25,080
seven. I didn't read too much into that. Oh, um, okay. And shopping news, I guess they dated

1567
02:27:25,080 --> 02:27:29,560
Amazon prime day for June 21st and 22nd. I know some people don't like to get their games from

1568
02:27:29,560 --> 02:27:33,880
there anymore, but for those that do there's that I imagine there'll be some gaming sales.

1569
02:27:33,880 --> 02:27:41,960
Uh, so that's a thing you're into check that out, I guess. Um, Ooh, I like, I forgot this from dark

1570
02:27:41,960 --> 02:27:48,040
Tetsuya. Okay. I really liked this. A paper boy and spy Hunter comic came out from DC.

1571
02:27:48,680 --> 02:27:54,680
What the hell is that? Is it, um, yes, spy Hunter and paper boy. Uh, but interesting cause

1572
02:27:54,840 --> 02:27:58,600
I replied to that and said, I don't see anywhere mentioned that it's based on the games,

1573
02:27:58,600 --> 02:28:03,320
but why else would you combine those two things? And it's clearly a paper boy and like a dude in

1574
02:28:03,320 --> 02:28:11,160
the car that looks like spy Hunter. That's kind of weird. Very, very weird. Um, SSU,

1575
02:28:11,160 --> 02:28:15,560
one hundred mountain chat says question, what is the status of the show being in person again?

1576
02:28:15,560 --> 02:28:21,400
No pressure. Just curious. I thought there was a date, but I forgot it. Um, there is not a date yet.

1577
02:28:21,960 --> 02:28:29,480
Um, and, um, hopefully, uh, we'll have news on that in the near future. Um, there's just,

1578
02:28:29,480 --> 02:28:34,600
there's a lot of changes going on, uh, behind the scenes and stuff. So I just don't know when that's

1579
02:28:34,600 --> 02:28:44,040
going to happen yet. Um, but hopefully soonish. So, um, all right. Uh, let's see. Pod culture

1580
02:28:44,040 --> 02:28:48,680
says he just found my Tik TOK. I said, don't follow me. He's in a suit and tie. Cause it was

1581
02:28:48,680 --> 02:28:52,440
listen to the Tik TOK. It was a Halloween costume that I put together in five minutes.

1582
02:28:52,440 --> 02:28:59,480
That should be obvious. So, all right. Um, orange right in chat says Midway arcade collection.

1583
02:28:59,480 --> 02:29:05,720
Nah, Midway comics universe. Okay. Here's that. So, all right. Uh, I think that'll do it. Let's

1584
02:29:05,720 --> 02:29:10,680
wrap things up. So, uh, thank you guys very much for listening to and, uh, supporting orange

1585
02:29:10,680 --> 02:29:14,520
launch radio. Hey, if you enjoyed what you heard here at the show, tell a friend or two about the

1586
02:29:14,520 --> 02:29:18,600
show, help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice. But, um,

1587
02:29:18,600 --> 02:29:25,080
as long as, uh, your voice is, uh, I'm sorry, as long as, let me start over. We are the show where

1588
02:29:25,080 --> 02:29:29,000
every gamer has a voice, but we need more voices here. So tell a friend or two about the show,

1589
02:29:29,000 --> 02:29:33,080
help us spread the word. And, uh, we really appreciate that. A nice five star review on

1590
02:29:33,080 --> 02:29:37,800
a site like iTunes or wherever it is you found this show goes an awful long way. Um,

1591
02:29:39,080 --> 02:29:42,760
if you feel so inclined, we have a shop where you can buy some merchandise,

1592
02:29:42,760 --> 02:29:47,720
vog and network.com slash shop. I keep pestering Jamie to add stuff to it. Um,

1593
02:29:47,720 --> 02:29:52,440
cause she launched her own shop. And so I got those designs. I sent you like a long time ago.

1594
02:29:53,080 --> 02:29:58,280
Yeah. Remember the pixel art vog thing. You are absolutely right. I need to get on that. I,

1595
02:29:58,280 --> 02:30:01,800
you sent me a finish. You sent me an in progress fog one, right? You finished a fog one.

1596
02:30:01,800 --> 02:30:05,880
No, I thought that was the finished one. Let me just double check. Cause I only remember seeing

1597
02:30:05,880 --> 02:30:10,120
one in progress, but you know what? Loki it is Dan. I, with everything that happened in the

1598
02:30:10,120 --> 02:30:16,520
past year, I absolutely could have slipped. So it sounds like something new coming soon. It sounds

1599
02:30:16,520 --> 02:30:25,800
like, so, uh, stay tuned for that vog network.com slash shop. Um, and, uh, I think, I think that's

1600
02:30:25,800 --> 02:30:29,800
really it. Uh, I guess we can get final thoughts as well. Uh, thank you for being here and listening

1601
02:30:29,800 --> 02:30:34,280
to the whole show. I know it was a little bit slower of a news week, but we're on the eve of

1602
02:30:34,280 --> 02:30:38,840
E3 slash the big June announcements, I think is really the better name for it.

1603
02:30:38,840 --> 02:30:42,120
Now that we have summer games fest and all these other things in the mix,

1604
02:30:42,120 --> 02:30:46,840
we're the week before the big June announcements. So, uh, it's going to be a fun week and we'll have

1605
02:30:46,840 --> 02:30:52,040
lots and lots to talk about next week. Uh, I'm really excited for it. So, uh, Loki,

1606
02:30:52,040 --> 02:30:56,200
why don't you give us your final thought tonight? It's going to be a very busy week for me and a

1607
02:30:56,200 --> 02:31:00,600
very exciting week as well. So excited for you to look, look forward to talking to you guys next

1608
02:31:00,600 --> 02:31:05,400
week. Uh, yeah, very excited to hear how it goes. Uh, even if we had to talk a lot about

1609
02:31:05,400 --> 02:31:10,360
Xbox and Bethesda as well next week, for sure. Um, and I, I don't know if I have a lot to say,

1610
02:31:10,360 --> 02:31:16,200
but, uh, my final thought is, um, I, I'm, I'm going to try to get on some more creation in

1611
02:31:16,200 --> 02:31:21,160
this next week as well and, and get my own community. Like Loki's found his dark soccer's

1612
02:31:21,160 --> 02:31:25,480
found hers and so forth. So, uh, there you go. That's going to do it for another week,

1613
02:31:25,480 --> 02:31:28,280
uh, here at orange launch radio. Have a wonderful night, everybody.
