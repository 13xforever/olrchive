00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,720
Tonight, we're going to talk about classic games getting cartoons, two of them. We've

2
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:17,240
had video game universe TV shows, comics, movies, and more, but cartoons are having

3
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:21,160
something of a renaissance, something of a long overdue proliferation in this, the streaming

4
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:24,800
era, which is pretty on brand for gamers, now that I'm thinking about it. TV shows

5
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:28,200
from video games, video games related to TV shows, you got your chocolate and my peanut

6
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:32,280
butter, and so on. It's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Sommers, and Loki to provide

7
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:35,640
actual detail about these two cartoons and the rest of the week's gaming news. Starting

8
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:37,440
right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.

9
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:47,400
Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show

10
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:53,960
where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio. We are live once again here

11
00:00:53,960 --> 00:01:01,400
on June 27th, 2021 with episode number 874 of our show. My name is Rob Roberts and I

12
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:07,360
am joined this week as I usually am by first off the one and only Dark Soccer, Jamie Sommers.

13
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:08,960
I'm wearing merch.

14
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:13,140
You are? I just noticed that while we were sitting on the cat thing before we go live

15
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:17,840
here at Twitch, I was like, oh, she's got her new merch on. How do you like the shirt?

16
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:21,800
The tank top is very thin, but it's comfortable and pretty stretchy.

17
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:22,800
I was going to say.

18
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:26,440
Raise her back. You can see the shoulder action.

19
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:30,960
For these 100 degree days, it probably works out pretty well that it's kind of thin.

20
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:37,600
I don't know. We're kind of low. I've got buddies who were up there in the Northeast

21
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:40,720
who are like, it's way too hot to exist.

22
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:45,600
Yeah, it's way hot. Well, it's way, one, it is hotter in the Pacific Northwest this weekend,

23
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:52,480
but two, the architecture, the homes aren't all built for it. Here where we live and in

24
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:57,800
places like Phoenix where it's always hot, central air conditioning is standard. Absolutely.

25
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:01,560
You have to have it. But in places in the Pacific Northwest, they don't really see this

26
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:06,000
a lot. So it's not always standard. So it's a little scary. So hope everybody's doing

27
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:13,520
OK up there. They're feeling the heat a lot more than we are here in our area.

28
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:18,720
Also, I will thank Dark Soccer for the cheap plug for our shop, Vogue Network dot com slash

29
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:22,800
shop if you want to get a tank top to wear in the heat or otherwise.

30
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:28,640
I saw someone bought one of the album art prints. Yeah, we got a tweet showing off the

31
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:33,360
album art print and it looked really nice. Like, you know, I want one. Yeah. Now I kind

32
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,960
of want one, too. Like, I have to admit, I didn't really know what it would look like.

33
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:40,280
But now that, you know, I'm I'm glad a viewer took the risk and bought it and then tweeted

34
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:43,600
us a picture because I'm like, oh, that's a nice little keepsake. I want one of those

35
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:48,440
to hang in the studio, honestly. Maybe maybe I should put up a larger one. Maybe. Maybe.

36
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:54,440
Who knows? We'll see. All right. Anyway, I told Dan I wanted to get one. You should you

37
00:02:54,440 --> 00:03:01,240
should buy all the things in our shop. What money? Good example. I don't know. The money.

38
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:08,080
I will. I will. When I get more than 12 streamers watching me at any given point in time, the

39
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:14,520
money spent on Dead by Daylight Cosmetics, which by which, by the way, I I finally finally

40
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:19,560
after all this time splurged on this week, I I had to have the Chris skin for Dead by

41
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:24,960
Daylight. Had to have it. I I bought the Chris and Claire. I bought all of the the Survivor

42
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:29,600
ones, even though I don't play Survivor. And I bought a Nia outfit today so I could try

43
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:35,040
to do the the outfit break. And I got it to work once, but I forgot to save the cosmetic

44
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:41,600
on Nia so I could keep Cheryl with black hair. And so that didn't work. So I have to try

45
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:46,700
it again. All right. Well, say hello as well. Playing a different game there in the background.

46
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:52,040
Say hello to Tech Master Loki. Hello. Hi. What is that that's playing behind you tonight?

47
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:57,320
I can't place that. Is that Rad Racer two? No. What is it? I can't place it again. It's

48
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:01,360
definitely a racing game of this side. Looks like an eight bit game. It's a racing game.

49
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:06,680
I can't tell if you're on a motor. Oh, you're on a motorcycle. Oh, it's the dang it. It's

50
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:10,920
the one where you smack people when you're on the motorcycle. No, it's not. That's not

51
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:18,160
Road Rash. He's playing a skateboarder. No, it's not skateboarder. What a rollerblader.

52
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:27,280
Yes. You know what game it is? I give up. It's Skitchen. Oh, I've never I don't think

53
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:31,120
I know that ever once played it. Yeah. Dark to see you got it in our chat, though, because

54
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:34,880
we do tape live every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern at the

55
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:38,560
voice of Geeks Network, Twitch dot TV slash Vogue Network. And if you want to participate

56
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:41,960
along with our show, you can join us in our chat room just like dark to see you did and

57
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:48,080
shouted out the name of the game there. Speaking of things that happened at Twitch on Vogue

58
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:55,080
Network, we we've hit a milestone this week. Oh, our celebrating turning 19 years old this

59
00:04:55,080 --> 00:05:00,240
week. So this is kind of our official celebration for that. But you guys know, as of several

60
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:05,720
years ago, we kind of we kind of put the confetti cannons away for every anniversary. It's like

61
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:13,200
birthdays after twenty one. Like, what's the point? Right. And so. So, yeah. But I mean,

62
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:16,240
obviously, this is a huge milestone and we did do something special for it. We did a

63
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:20,120
midweek broadcast and this was a lot of fun. So on Wednesday night, which was the actual

64
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:24,880
birthday of the show, because the first episode was June twenty third of 2002. So on June

65
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:29,360
twenty third this week, we actually got together and we listened to episode number one and

66
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:33,920
we were ready for all the cringe that came with listening to episode number one. But come

67
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:39,760
to find out, you know, and I hadn't listened to that show in a very long time and I don't

68
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:46,000
think I haven't listened to it since we did it. Exactly. So I got to say, it wasn't as bad

69
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,040
as I thought it was going to be. And I know that sounds really weird to say, especially

70
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:52,600
because, you know, we pour our heart and soul into this show and I'm very proud of it. But I

71
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:57,720
also recognize it's come a long way since the early days. And I was kind of surprised

72
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:02,880
episode number one was more polished than I expected it to be. Not to say it wasn't a

73
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:07,880
little bumpy, you know, but I was kind of walked away from that going, that wasn't that bad.

74
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:12,040
I kind of hyped that up to be a lot worse. And I felt like you guys kind of walked away with

75
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:19,840
similar opinions on that. So, yeah. Yeah. And I thought there was some very there was some

76
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:26,200
things in it that were very like, like how OLR still is today. Like the thing I well, there

77
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:31,160
were two things in it. Number one, and this shocked me. I didn't realize we had a webcam all

78
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:37,000
the way back on episode one. The one frame webcam. Yep. I knew the I think is even worse than that.

79
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:43,400
I think it was like one frame every three minutes. But I remember that we had a webcam in the early

80
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:48,920
days of OLR. I thought we didn't do it until we moved to that second studio that was the apartment

81
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:52,840
that Loki and I lived in. I didn't think we had a webcam in the first days of the show. So that was

82
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:58,360
a shock to find out that we've been doing video just about as long as we've been doing OLR

83
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:03,880
of some sort. I guess there were some gaps in that because we were doing slideshows. Exactly.

84
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:10,440
Exactly. But then the other thing I thought was very interesting about that whole thing was that

85
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:15,080
Loki, of course, we all knew Loki was at episode one, even though originally he wasn't there for

86
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:19,880
the discussion about we should do an Orange Lounge radio. But obviously, Loki put his heart and soul

87
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:24,920
into it as well from episode one so much that we kind of retconned him to a host from the beginning.

88
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:29,800
But if you listen to episode one where he wasn't technically a co-host yet, it's really funny

89
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:34,440
that he's bringing that same perspective of, oh, here's some news stories that we haven't

90
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:39,240
gotten to yet that we should kind of bring up. And he kind of was helping to throw out some topics

91
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:43,160
there towards the end of the show. And I'm the one sitting there going, well, maybe maybe the

92
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:47,080
critics were right. We can't fill two hours talking about Bomani. And Loki was like, well,

93
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:51,640
what about this? What about this? So I thought that was really surprising, like in a pleasantly

94
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:56,600
fun kind of way. So, yeah, that was I remember doing that. Yeah, I didn't remember that either.

95
00:07:56,600 --> 00:08:02,520
But it's it's at the same time, I'm not surprised. It's why you're still here. Right. So it's great.

96
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:09,160
Yeah. Anyhow, TigerClaw in chat says, do you remember how fast your Internet was back in

97
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:16,440
the days? Was it on dial up? The early O.L.R. was on a DSL connection. So that was blazing fast at

98
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:22,600
the time. But O.L.R. was also dial up friendly radio when it started on live through 65. So

99
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:27,640
that's why the recording is not the greatest quality, because it was like it's like something

100
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:32,840
like 24 Kbps or whatever was dial up friendly at the time. So it's you know, it's it's a pretty

101
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:37,400
poor quality. But there were a lot of people, especially in remote parts of the country,

102
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:42,520
that were still on dial up at the time. So it kind of worked out for them. And then some kind

103
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:47,240
words from the chat. Bobby Black Wolf in chat says it shows how much O.L.R. has changed,

104
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:53,320
but also how much O.L.R. has stayed the same. Yep. Mr. Rhizos in chat says happy 19th anniversary

105
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:57,560
O.L.R. Thank you very much. And just a big, you know, thank you again. I know I say this a lot,

106
00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:03,000
but it's because I mean it. Thank you to all of you out there who support the show, who listen,

107
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:08,280
who say nice things like that. I got some really touching tweets throughout the week this week in

108
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:13,800
response to O.L.R. turning 19 and such. And I just yeah, I mean, it's it's really the motivation

109
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:19,080
that keeps things going. So I just I want to give a big thank you to everyone out there that

110
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:24,840
continues to listen to this. I thought it was hilarious that there were more people

111
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:29,880
watching that broadcast on Wednesday of us listening to episode one. There were more people

112
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:34,200
watching that than were actually listening to episode one back in the day. But I'll tell you

113
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:39,880
what, Dark Tetsuya gets a gold star because he was there for both. He was there for episode and

114
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:44,120
his name is in episode one because we shouted him out in the chat room, which apparently we had an

115
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:49,000
IRC chat room in the early show that I read, I think three times throughout the whole show. So

116
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:54,760
I've gotten better at that. That's for sure. But anyway, I remember you saying that it didn't sound

117
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:59,560
like we got any at first, but yeah, they came in. That might have been it, too. I feel like the chat

118
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:05,160
was probably really slow in those early episodes. But Joe Mama was there. Joe Mama was the first

119
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:10,120
chat comment ever read. So there was that. So it's just kind of funny. Dark Sakura,

120
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:14,200
Loki, anything you guys want to say about the 19th birthday and all these candles on the cake?

121
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:22,440
It wasn't that bad. I sounded really sinacy, but I think I always sound really sinacy.

122
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:27,480
Well, and the poor quality of the recording and the poor microphones, I think kind of-

123
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:29,000
I don't think that can mimic sinus.

124
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:32,920
You'd be surprised how horrible it can make your voice sound, but yeah.

125
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:40,920
But anything on turning 19 years old, not so much episode one, but just this milestone of 19 years,

126
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:46,680
which we still believe makes us the longest running internet show slash podcast about games

127
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:52,680
out there, period. Any- I'm officially looking into the Guinness thing.

128
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:55,400
Yeah, that would be a very nice thing. You have to pay for it.

129
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:57,400
Yeah, but how much is it? I think it's worth it.

130
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:59,480
Yeah, we might be able to- if it's only a couple of hundred dollars,

131
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:02,440
I bet we could just pool it together. I think it's a couple of thousand dollars.

132
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:06,760
Well, maybe we'll have to just- Maybe we'll take a Kickstarter.

133
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:10,520
Maybe, maybe. I don't know. Loki, any thoughts on turning 19?

134
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:18,760
No, it's just another episode. 20 will be really cool. I mean, that'll be really significant.

135
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:23,080
And no one will realize- no one will know.

136
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:25,880
Yeah, but I gave up on that at the five-year mark.

137
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:28,840
Yeah, we'll see.

138
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:36,040
Phoenix7726 says, will y'all be putting episode one up on the RSS feed again? That's a no.

139
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:41,800
And the reason why, A, there's copyright music all over it because we used to take music breaks.

140
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:45,720
Actually, as a quick aside, and Dark Tetsuya, if you're listening, please post that link in

141
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:51,720
chat that you had in the private thread that only the host can see with the stories every week.

142
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:56,040
But you put together a YouTube playlist of all the songs from episode one,

143
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:59,720
and people were asking about that. So Dark Tetsuya, please share that link in chat

144
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:06,040
because I'd love for the folks that were asking, what were those songs that you were skipping over?

145
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:08,760
I'd like you guys to have a copy of that. So check that out.

146
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:19,800
And also just because even though I was pleasantly surprised that nothing was said was as terrible

147
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:24,520
as I thought it was going to be for the age of the show, there were still a couple things where

148
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:34,600
I'm like, people looking at that in a 2021 lens without the right frame of mind may not appreciate

149
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:41,240
it. So I think it's best that it just be kept in the vault. It's not hard to find. I'll tell you

150
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:46,520
that episode one of OLR is not hard to find, especially if you kind of poke around the old

151
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:51,720
forums at VOG Network, which they're no longer active or usable, but you can still look at old

152
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:57,400
posts. You can probably find episode one pretty easy, but I'm just going to stress this. I always

153
00:12:57,400 --> 00:13:03,000
do. Those shows are nearly 20 years old at this point. So just keep that in mind.

154
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:05,800
So I found the answer.

155
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,440
For which... Oh, the Guinness thing.

156
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:09,160
For Guinness.

157
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:10,040
Yes. What is that?

158
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:17,480
So for a new record, it's $1,000 for a priority application where they process it in five days.

159
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:22,520
For a standard application, there's no cost and takes up to 12 weeks for it to be reviewed.

160
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,680
And then send us the guidelines.

161
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:29,400
All right. Well, Dark Soccer, you're in charge of that project. Let's make it happen. I'd love that.

162
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:31,080
Do we want this to happen, chat?

163
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:31,720
I think so.

164
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:38,840
Well, I'll wait to see what chat says. I'm going to do it anyway, but I want to see what they say.

165
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:45,640
Phoenix7726 says, was there some casual ableism or something? There was an instance of a word

166
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:49,240
that was used far more often 20 years ago that wasn't...

167
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:49,960
That wasn't me.

168
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:55,080
It wasn't... Well, it wasn't any of us. It was actually a guest, but I don't want to deflect on

169
00:13:55,080 --> 00:14:00,200
the guest either because I'm sure in subsequent episodes, it fell out of our mouths too at some

170
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:06,360
point. But I just want to clearly say it certainly wasn't appropriate then and isn't appropriate now,

171
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:11,640
but society's rules were a little different. And unfortunately, we have a tendency to parrot things

172
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:16,920
that we hear on TV and around us and stuff. But I think it was interesting because Dark Soccer,

173
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:21,160
after we did that, we rated another Twitch streamer. We rated Losing Color, and we were

174
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:27,160
talking about it in their chat. And I thought there was some very nice chat in there about,

175
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:31,800
well, if you can look back on that and at least say, wow, that was cringe and I wouldn't do that

176
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:35,800
again, then it does show growth and that you've learned from it. And I think that's something

177
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:39,000
to celebrate. And that's really what it was all about, honestly. So...

178
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:46,920
Yeah. And I mean, in my early days of going into Elsie's channel, by the way, they were like,

179
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:51,880
oh, tell me all about it and let me go off at length. And then they followed us.

180
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:56,440
That's great. That's very nice. All right. I think you're seeing some folks in chat that

181
00:14:56,440 --> 00:15:01,160
want to see C.O.L.R. in the Guinness Book of World Records. So we got to make that happen.

182
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:02,440
I'm creating my account right now.

183
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:08,600
All right. Okay. Anyhow, let's get into some other gaming topics here. So again,

184
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:13,080
one more thank you for helping us get to 19 years. Let's push through one more year. Let's

185
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:19,480
see if we can get to 20. All right. Let's go ahead and get into our top story tonight,

186
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:26,120
which has to do with Windows 11. Windows 11 was announced this week. Microsoft did a big

187
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:30,680
to do about that. And you might be wondering, well, what's Windows 11 have to do with gaming?

188
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:34,120
And I would say, really? You're going to ask that? Because there's a lot of people

189
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:38,760
that are playing on PC, Windows types of environments. And so, of course,

190
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:43,000
it's absolutely important what Windows 11 is going to be doing, especially when it comes to

191
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:48,600
gaming. And I think a lot of people have peered in the crystal ball and kind of thought, hmm,

192
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:56,840
Microsoft does Windows. Microsoft does Xbox. What is Windows 11 going to do to Xbox?

193
00:15:56,840 --> 00:16:00,520
And sure enough, as part of the Windows 11 announcements earlier this week,

194
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:06,920
they have announced that Xbox Game Pass will be built into Windows 11. So if you're already subbed,

195
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:10,120
you can get right in there and play your games in Windows 11. I have to be honest,

196
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:14,360
isn't it kind of that way with Windows 10? I mean, I understand it is. Yeah,

197
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:18,840
I understand they're going to make it like it's maybe in Windows 10. It's kind of like a

198
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:23,880
separate app. It's a separate standalone thing that like like the Steam store or something that

199
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:28,920
you run. And so I can see that maybe like in Windows 11, it's going to be more integrated.

200
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:34,200
But I also kind of think this headline is a little bit like, is it going to be that different? I

201
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:40,760
actually don't. Yeah. That sounds it's more click baity. Maybe a little bit. But I get the point.

202
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:46,360
I get why it's newsworthy. Integrated verse into the application versus a standalone app

203
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:50,600
is a difference. It is a different, you know, way to present. But I think for most people,

204
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:57,480
it's going to feel very similar. But we're not really surprised to see that. But Microsoft kind

205
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:04,200
of also going out of their way to invite other people into Windows 11 store, probably because

206
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:08,520
they don't want to be seen as monopolizing the market because, you know, I think Microsoft's

207
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:12,920
gotten slaps on the wrist before for things like antitrust and things like that. So even though

208
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:16,920
they're going to be building Game Pass into it, they're kind of going out of their way to say,

209
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:23,160
we want Steam. We want Epic Game Store. We want other. I think. I think they had even said we

210
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:27,000
want iMessage. I know that's not about gaming, but they have said these other things. They want

211
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:34,120
to get these other things integrated into Windows. So in a comment, I was trying to find the keyword

212
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:42,680
here. Is that who said this? The OS chief Panos Panay mentioned to The Verge in an interview

213
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:47,240
that Microsoft would like to add these third-party stores, specifically calling out Steam and Epic

214
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:52,920
Game Stores. And Panay in the interview said these stores would be very welcome.

215
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:59,640
They want to make Windows 11 a go-to source for app, saying, quote, you type the app in and you

216
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:06,200
get the app you want. So interesting. It should also be said, though, that Windows 11 does not

217
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:12,920
plan to charge a fee to have apps listed. However, that doesn't apply to games. There's been a very

218
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:19,800
interesting, clear distinction between apps are free, games are not. So I don't know how that's

219
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:24,760
going to work. If they were to try to put Steam in there, then does that mean that Microsoft would

220
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:29,000
take a cut because it's games? I don't know. I guess they would have some things to work out

221
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:36,360
there. But considering Steam exists on Windows 10 today and doesn't get a cut, I don't see why,

222
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:41,560
again, I think it's a question about is it integrated into the system and something you

223
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:46,360
get right there like on, you know, or is it, you know, a separate app that you launch? And I feel

224
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:51,160
like things like Steam, Epic Game Store and so forth will just be separate apps that you launch.

225
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:59,080
So going to comment and chat, TigerCon Chat says, I advise against upgrading to Windows 11.

226
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:03,560
You may have some hardware that you normally use that probably won't have any Windows 11 drivers

227
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:07,320
on launch. If there's a piece of hardware you've been using for the last couple years,

228
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:11,160
you have to check if the manufacturer is still supporting it with Windows 11 drivers.

229
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:17,480
And Mr. Izos in Chat says, as with new consoles, it's always worth to wait a bit to see how the

230
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:22,680
existing hardware catches up with Windows to upgrade. Never be on that first all buggy batch.

231
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:30,680
I probably will not upgrade to Windows 11 on day one, but I hope to be an early-ish adopter.

232
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:35,320
That is assuming that they don't force it on you. Like, I don't know if this is going to be

233
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:39,960
because they were talking about Windows 10 being like kind of the last update of Windows that

234
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:43,960
there's going to be unless they're going to kind of start treating us like, you know,

235
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:47,800
Mac OS or something like that, where it's just the version numbers are going to keep

236
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:52,920
going up as it updates. I don't know if they're going to make you name the new ones, Monterey.

237
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:58,680
Yeah, I understand that. But that's just kind of. I don't know, a formality. I mean,

238
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:02,360
what I'm saying is, you know, well done branding, it's well done branding. You don't have to

239
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:09,240
purchase like a brand new install of an OS. It just updates and, you know, whatever you call it,

240
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:13,080
a different name. Right. But like, I don't know if they're playing on doing that with Windows 11.

241
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:18,520
If that's the case, if they are, then they're going to shove it right into your face.

242
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:23,560
They did confirm it's free. So it's it's not and they're going to shove it right into your face.

243
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:27,560
They'll absolutely shove it in your face. But they did that with Windows 10. It's very easy

244
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:34,760
to click. Not today, you know, and I want to say with Windows, not not today, Microsoft.

245
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:42,600
I want to say when they did Windows 10, you could also make a backup of your old OS for like 30

246
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:48,200
days and revert back at any time, because I think they kind of read the tea leaves on why people

247
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:52,440
were hesitant to do the upgrade. I think that was a smart thing to do. That was the thing that

248
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:57,160
finally got me to push the button was when it was like, OK, you can revert back in 30 days if you

249
00:20:57,160 --> 00:21:02,200
don't like it. So they would be very smart to do something like that with Windows 11. And I think

250
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:09,320
that'll encourage more people to adopt it. So we'll see. Let's see, other comments in chat.

251
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:16,920
Did you do pod culture and chat says I'm running 11 without issues. Just had to enable TPM in my

252
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:21,320
BIOS. Thank you. Thank you for being one of the people willing to put up with a buggy piece of

253
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:25,800
software so that when it comes out for the rest of us, those will all be ironed out. But I'm glad

254
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:32,120
it's running without issues for you so far. That's great. E3VL in chat says, didn't they force 8 to

255
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:37,000
10 when it launched? Maybe my memory was fuzzy. I didn't go from 8 to 10. I went from 7 to 10.

256
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:43,240
But I remember it wasn't forced. So there was that. Yeah, I went from 8 to 10. It wasn't forced,

257
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:48,120
but like they were kind of basically it was, you know, I hate Windows 8 so much.

258
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:54,840
Going from 7 to 8 was like kind of a downgrade almost. Yeah. Because that was when they're like,

259
00:21:54,840 --> 00:22:01,960
oh, well, tablets are the future. Everything must be tablet like. So it was a warm welcome to have

260
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:06,600
another OS to go to aside from 8. So I think that's why a lot of people kind of jump ship

261
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:12,120
really fast on that. I think so. So to tie it kind of like back to gaming and all that,

262
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:16,360
I think it's going to be interesting that we have the new OS. And it does feel like it's probably

263
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:21,720
about time, like it's been a few years. It probably feels like it's about time for a new OS.

264
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:25,800
But I'm not sure if at the end of the day, our gaming experiences are going to change

265
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:29,880
that significantly. I mean, yes, they're talking about the Game Pass integration, but or the Game

266
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:34,120
Pass stuff. I just don't think it's going to play out that differently than what we see in Windows

267
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:38,440
10 today. It's not like it's going to pre install games or anything like that. At least I hope to

268
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:42,520
hell it doesn't. I don't think it will, because that would be so rude to your bandwidth. They

269
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:50,040
did that with the included games with the install before, I think. I can't remember because I

270
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:53,560
remember like Candy Crush is in there. So that was like an immediate install. But

271
00:22:55,320 --> 00:23:00,600
yeah, hopefully there's not kind of bloatware in there. Obi-Wan Jabroni in chat says, I'm a Mac

272
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:04,440
user. You're speaking a foreign language. I understand, of course. And I know Dark

273
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:08,440
Soccer is a big fan of her Mac. And there's certainly nothing wrong with that. But I know

274
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:13,480
even with Mac, sometimes what goes on with Windows can still kind of affect things in case they get

275
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:18,280
like this thing you're kind of talking about with the Mass Effect trilogy and the difficulties

276
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:24,360
it's kind of been up and running getting that. But I would wonder, I think this would be an

277
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:31,400
extremely smart thing for Microsoft to do is to leverage some of that xCloud stuff like they best

278
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:37,640
have an xCloud player for the Mac. But I guess that's on Microsoft to figure that out and maybe

279
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:45,080
perhaps some things on Apple as well. Anyhow, let's go ahead and move on. Can you get Edge on

280
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:53,960
a Mac? Technically, yes. Yeah. So technically, I think it does run through Edge.

281
00:23:55,000 --> 00:24:00,840
Well, xCloud's on a website, too, right? And I know Chrome's on. I'm running Chrome on this

282
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:04,280
very Mac that's powering our show. I have to use Chrome to play Stadia.

283
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:09,240
Yeah. So I was going to say, I'm pretty sure Chrome will do xCloud, too. So that's a very

284
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:13,640
good point. You're right. They don't even need a native app. It's all going to run through the web,

285
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:18,920
which is probably what the future is anyway. Oh, and Obi-Wan Jabroni says it works on Safari. Well,

286
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:25,320
there you go. That's the go-to Mac browser. So it makes sense. Anyhow.

287
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:29,080
Good. Anything you have to do to prevent no one wants to install Edge.

288
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:36,760
I don't think Edge is as bad as the last one. But anyway, all right. Let's get into other stuff.

289
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:41,560
Let's talk about our gaming weeks and what we've been playing on PC, console, or otherwise. And

290
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:44,440
we'll start off with Dark Sakura with the question, how was your gaming week?

291
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:50,120
Um, I did not again play Animal Crossing. I have played a lot of Dead by Daylight. I basically,

292
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:56,120
in just a couple hours a night for about four nights, I got Hag to 40.

293
00:24:57,400 --> 00:25:05,160
Um, I'm now a Hag main. It's amazing. Uh, I actually like Larry's with Hag.

294
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:09,800
I hate Haddonfield still. It's still garbage. And the corn is still garbage.

295
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:17,160
But I actually don't mind Larry's or Hawkins. I've tried Hag. I can't do it. She's too slow for me.

296
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:22,840
And the trap thing is like, for whatever reason, the trap thing for me is so delayed.

297
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:28,120
Like when I try to trigger the trap, I can't get a hit in. So it's just Hag's run for me.

298
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:35,960
When I get an explosion alert, I've just got my pinky on my control key the whole time.

299
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:41,400
Hmm. So, or sorry, my command key. I mean, I'm playing on a Mac, but for you, it would be

300
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:49,240
what, what button is that? Alt. But anyway, um, and I'm still having some fun with doctor

301
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:53,400
and I'm still playing piggy sometimes, but I've pretty much been nothing but Hag this last week.

302
00:25:53,400 --> 00:26:01,800
It's been great. Um, so I'm team Hagatha. Um, I also finally, they have updated a windows

303
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:08,760
arm sufficiently that I can get mass effect to load, but it does not load all the way.

304
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:15,960
It does not play well. It's still in the very infancy of that, uh, 64 bit emulation

305
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:25,560
or whatever emulation it wants to use. Um, so I'm still waiting, but it was exciting getting,

306
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:33,080
getting it to work. I'm actually running the, the, uh, early beta builds for windows arm

307
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:40,680
and I've been fairly pleased, fairly pleased. Nice. And of course word escapes because I'm

308
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:49,400
addicted to letters. All right. Uh, Loki, how was your gaming week? It's all Minecraft still. So,

309
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:57,000
this week's been interesting. I've was trying to set up some content to record for another episode,

310
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:02,280
had a plan and everything, but then, uh, we decided to update the server to one 17.

311
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:08,520
So that added a lot of things and totally derailed everything I wanted to do and also broke my

312
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:14,680
shaders, which I was sad about it at first, but actually I'm kind of getting used to the way it

313
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:21,000
looks before shaders. Um, and also the frame rates a little bit much better, like 10 times

314
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:28,520
better. Um, so I've been just messing around with the one 17 stuff, um, new shop designs and stuff.

315
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:35,560
So I'm going to film that content. And then I think actually that the Optifine has re-enabled

316
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:40,440
shaders. So probably I need that pretty soon. Sorry, awkward, but I need to do a quick AFK.

317
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,120
Smoosh is wailing. So I need to make sure he's okay. I'll be right back.

318
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:51,080
He shouldn't be wailing because that's illegal and frowned upon.

319
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:53,560
What if he's wailing on a guitar doing some sick riffs?

320
00:27:54,920 --> 00:28:02,200
Maybe. I don't know. Um, so yeah, it's been a lot of that. I've been designing an axolotl shop,

321
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:06,280
so we're going to be selling axolotls in the shopping district now. And it's awesome. You

322
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:11,960
got to, can't wait to show you the design. It'll be in the new, the new episode. I have a farm now

323
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:20,440
to get those as well. So I have, I probably have at least 50 to 60 axolotls at the moment. So it's

324
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:28,520
pretty crazy. Um, but yeah, uh, one, one 17 is pretty awesome. The caves are a lot more

325
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:33,400
interesting now. Not as interesting as they're going to be in one 18 when that comes out, but

326
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:39,240
it has been, um, definitely worth getting used to the only downside though so far. And I think it's

327
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:45,080
a server issue is my entire gold farm that was in there is completely broken, which is unfortunate

328
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:50,520
because I need that gold farm to run my shop on the server. And that fact that it doesn't work

329
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:57,160
anymore is a problem. Although no, nothing in the update should have broken that it's, I think it's

330
00:28:57,160 --> 00:29:02,840
more of just something because our server runs paper MC, which is kind of a modded client or

331
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:08,360
modded server. And there's additional tweaks and stuff that they do in there. The fixed stuff that

332
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:13,320
you know, maybe broken in vanilla. I think something with that is affecting what's going on.

333
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:18,120
So I'm trying to get the admins to look into that. But in the meantime, I'm also setting up a cash

334
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:22,680
for gold shop instead, you know, like those old commercials we used to see all the time.

335
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:25,880
I'm back smooshes. Okay. Thank you. Okay.

336
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:31,880
Glad he's not wailing. So yeah, it's been just lots of Minecraft stuff. So I'm hopefully going

337
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:39,240
to be working on stuff for another episode soon. I'm trying to get it down to one episode a week.

338
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:43,160
I mean, listening to the folks come behind the scenes on like the hermitcraft stuff,

339
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:48,680
they said that it takes about eight hours to film, edit and publish an episode for them.

340
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:52,840
And it's taken me way longer to do that. Like I'm having way more footage like there's

341
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:55,640
when they were talking about like, Oh, yeah, I have to go through an hour and a half worth

342
00:29:55,640 --> 00:30:03,160
of footage. And that's a lot. Like, I'm going through a good 10 times the amount of footage

343
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:08,360
than they are. So I'm doing something wrong. So I need to kind of refine that process. But

344
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:13,160
hopefully we'll have a new episode soon. I don't want it to be two weeks, but maybe in the middle

345
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:17,080
of the week. Well, that's part of the learning process, though. And another quick plug for

346
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:21,640
because I don't think you put that if I, you know, what is time anymore? But I seem to remember

347
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:25,880
that your big collaboration video went up on Monday, so the day after our last show. So a big

348
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:29,240
shout out to go follow your YouTube channel to check out your latest video.

349
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:34,200
Yeah, it's up there. I think it was last Sunday or something like that. But yeah, there's a there's

350
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:39,320
a lot. My last video with Tango Tech from hermitcraft. They're in the middle of season

351
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:43,880
eight right now. So it's pretty awesome. But I got to collaborate with him a little bit and

352
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:49,720
just kind of talk about his process and stuff. And we started working on just something. I mean,

353
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:53,400
off the cuff, it's kind of hard to build, especially with it, you know, I was super

354
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:57,880
nervous. So it's hard to kind of come up with something offline, though, I've been able to

355
00:30:57,880 --> 00:31:01,480
come up with something much grander, which will be in probably a future episode, but

356
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:05,720
it'll be inspired by what we kind of started there. It was still a fun experience. So I would

357
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:11,400
I totally recommend you watch it and give me a like and subscribe and all that fun stuff.

358
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:17,960
All right, we will. Let's see my gaming week. I honestly didn't play a lot of new stuff still

359
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:23,560
going on the day of the daylight. I had to play the Debbie Delight. The Debbie Delight. I played

360
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:32,520
some Nemesis. Hey, Nemesis. Yeah. Did you whip it out? I did. I wish the whip length was a

361
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:39,800
little bit longer. I wish it was a little bit faster. Yeah. And that's so that's taken some

362
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:43,640
getting taken some getting used to. But I was finally able to get that daily done where it's

363
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:48,040
like you have to max out. You have to play four times to get it done because it's max out your

364
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:53,560
meter like four times. So I did that. You can just do it by hitting zombies. I. Yeah, but it's so

365
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:57,560
much slower that way. Like it's better to just do a survivor and get them in a chase, but you have

366
00:31:57,560 --> 00:32:01,800
to get so close and then do it because you can try to risk it from a little further back, but you

367
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:07,720
might not hit them. But my other big day by daylight accomplishment is I got Jill to 40.

368
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:12,200
So I got my blast mine teachable finally. So I'm probably going to move on to another character.

369
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:16,600
I'll probably do Jake next because I really want Iron Will. So, yeah, I've been working on those.

370
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:20,600
I should probably do a stream of that at some point because I talk about all the time. But

371
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:25,880
whenever I stream, it's usually playing Final Fantasy 14, which, by the way, just as an aside,

372
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:29,400
because I just realized it's not in tonight's show role and maybe it should have been.

373
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:33,960
They're doing a very interesting promotion with Final Fantasy 14 right now where you can get a

374
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:40,520
special black chocobo. It's specifically the fat chocobo. You can get a flying mount black fat

375
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:51,960
chocobo if you have to watch certain Final Fantasy 14 streamers and give four subs. And if you donate

376
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:57,960
four subs while watching particular Final Fantasy 14 streamers, then you get the black fat chocobo.

377
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:02,840
And this is causing a little bit of controversy in the community because the list of who they

378
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:07,880
curated. Again, I don't want to talk negative about any of those people, but it could have

379
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:14,200
probably shown a little more diversity. And quite frankly, in my opinion, I don't understand why

380
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:19,880
it's limited to begin with. And I'm not trying to be salty or whatever. How dare I wasn't included?

381
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:23,800
No, I mean, I stream the game once every two weeks. Of course, I'm not going to be included

382
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:29,400
in something like that, but I don't understand why they don't just open it up to anyone streaming

383
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:35,800
the game. Usually when you're talking about No Man's Sky giveaways in that game, it was anybody

384
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:40,280
who's broadcasting it. When it was things like World of Warcraft and Overwatch, it was anybody

385
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:46,120
who's broadcasting it. So I'm not sure what the thought process there was to limiting it to

386
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:51,000
certain streamers. And again, I promise you, I'm not trying to talk negative about any streamers.

387
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:56,120
I'm sure those streamers work very hard, but the problem is not who they included. The problem is

388
00:33:56,120 --> 00:34:03,960
who they left out. And there's some big problems with who they left out. And so that's an issue.

389
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:06,760
But anyway, I needed to bring that up at some point because I just realized it's not on the

390
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:11,160
show role because I don't know if any big sites actually reported on that. I think it was more

391
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:16,120
of a Twitter thing. So there's that. But I have been playing Final Fantasy XIV and I did hit a

392
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:23,560
big milestone in that game. I have gotten my warrior class past level 50, which means every

393
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:30,760
job I have past level 50, which was the realm reborn cap. So I have my crown because that was

394
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:35,880
an achievement in a realm reborn was if you got everything to max level, which was 50 at the time,

395
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:43,800
your character got a red crown. So I can get that now for glamour and walk everywhere with a crown.

396
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:51,160
So I can't wait to get them all to 60. I have three jobs left that aren't 80. Warrior,

397
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:57,720
Monk, and Black Mage. Black Mage is 73. That's real close. The other two are lagging behind in

398
00:34:57,720 --> 00:35:02,520
the 50s. So I'm really going to work this week and the upcoming weeks and have everything 80

399
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:08,120
well in advance of the new expansion. I'm going back to what I was talking about with XIV. Bobby

400
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:13,000
Blackwolf says, one of the streamers is part of GDQ and said that he was only told to expect just

401
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:18,360
a few subs. And he basically went on for hours and made lots of money. The subs were rolling in

402
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:21,960
and he was already a partner. Well, yeah, they don't want to, they don't want to set expectations

403
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:27,960
inappropriately, but of course these folks are going to get a ton of subs. People want shit in

404
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:33,320
Final Fantasy XIV. It's the biggest MMO right now. You know, of course people want to have that. If

405
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:39,080
Blizzard did this for wow, the exact same thing would happen. It's just weird that they didn't

406
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:44,280
foresee that. I don't know, whatever. Anyway, Misha Kha earlier was talking about playing

407
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:51,320
Palace of the Dead, which is a very good way to level up DPS alts. I might actually do some of

408
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:55,640
that with my monk. Warrior, you can kind of queue for dungeons over and over because you're not

409
00:35:55,640 --> 00:36:00,600
waiting long as a tank. But yeah, Palace of the Dead is a really good way to grind experience

410
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:07,640
in the lower levels, especially. So, all right. I think that's really about it for my gameplay.

411
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:11,240
Honestly, Dead by Daylight, Final Fantasy XIV, maybe a little bit of stuff on console,

412
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:17,400
but nothing more than like an hour. So, all right. I was gone all weekend anyway. So, all right.

413
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:20,120
By the way, it's submitted.

414
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:22,200
That was fast.

415
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:25,160
Yeah, I work quick, quickly.

416
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:29,400
I'm surprised we didn't have to like, did you have to provide any documentation or anything else?

417
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:30,280
Do they just follow up?

418
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:34,840
They just follow up. Although I don't know why this is saying I'm in Uganda. Let me fix that.

419
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:37,960
Okay. Yeah. I've never been there.

420
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:43,240
That would be unfortunate if we get in the book and then oops, we were credited to the

421
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:49,560
wrong country. That would be unfortunate. Anyway. All right. Let's move on and get into some other

422
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:53,640
gaming news and we'll start with Loki with what's going on in the gaming world this week.

423
00:36:54,360 --> 00:37:00,680
Yeah. So, apparently, Final Fantasy is getting an animated series. So,

424
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:04,840
Final Fantasy IX to be exact because there's been lots of different Final Fantasy animated series.

425
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:11,480
But yeah, this is pretty interesting. Kind of weird though that they picked Final Fantasy IX

426
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:19,000
being it's been so long since it's come out to actually do a series for it. But I don't know.

427
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:25,240
I guess they're doing it. So, apparently, this is going to be done by Cyber Group Studios.

428
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:29,960
They're also going to be doing different merchandising and licensing to go along with it

429
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:36,840
as well. I'm not sure where this is going to be featured yet. I'm wondering if that's going to be

430
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:43,880
on a streaming service at some point. But it'd be cool to check it out whenever it actually makes

431
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:49,560
it out. Yeah. I was kind of surprised to hear Final Fantasy IX. Well, I mean, I am and I'm not

432
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:57,000
because Final Fantasy IX's world and characters kind of lend itself well to that sort of thing.

433
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:01,800
So, I mean, it's not like they can't do one for Final Fantasy X, but I get it with IX.

434
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:08,520
But you're right. It is interesting why that one, especially when Seven's got the remake and all

435
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:12,840
this other stuff. And surely, they're going to want to push Final Fantasy XVI eventually.

436
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:17,880
But maybe for whatever reason, they just decided this is the one that has the best story to tell.

437
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:26,040
Yeah. I mean, I guess. I mean, they're targeting this right now. It's supposed to be adapted for

438
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:34,120
a target audience of eight to 13 year olds. So that'll be interesting. A whole new audience

439
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:39,560
for Final Fantasy IX. Some comments in chat. DJ Rama S says, as long as it's not Final Fantasy VIII,

440
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:48,840
that's the worst Final Fantasy. While your shade is on point with me, here's the thing. I do think

441
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:52,760
VIII had a good story, though. It's just I didn't care for the game in VIII. So if they wanted to

442
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:57,000
animate VIII, then cool, because I wouldn't have to play it. And the cutscenes are amazing in VIII,

443
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:02,040
so I'm good with that being animated. That's where I'm at, but I appreciated the shade.

444
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:07,400
Let's see. Zen Monkey says it's probably because it's the easiest to animate because they're so

445
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:15,560
small. That makes sense. Quest Buster says Final Fantasy IX is pretty family friendly.

446
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:21,000
Final Fantasy IX is pretty friendly Final Fantasy for a cartoon like this. Say friendly Final

447
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:26,680
Fantasy. Family friendly Final Fantasy. Barring a few changes, it should work out and be pretty

448
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:33,720
interesting. Yeah, I'm super curious about it. I think as you referred to there, Loki,

449
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:38,840
it's not the only thing that's getting a TV show because there's that Final Fantasy XIV TV show

450
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:43,080
that we're supposed to be getting as well. That's not animated, but that was the thing because that's

451
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:47,880
by the same studio that does The Witcher and all that stuff. That'll be interesting. It'll be

452
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:52,840
awesome, but we haven't heard anything on it in some time. But granted, all the early announcements

453
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:59,480
were right before the pandemic. I'm sure that has slowed the plans down significantly. So I get it.

454
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:04,280
But I just know that that's the thing that's kind of like in the works as well. Tiger Kong chat says

455
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:10,200
why not animate the first Final Fantasy? Do a series based on the first game that started it all.

456
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:13,960
You know, that's an interesting game coming out. Yeah, I was just gonna say there's a game coming

457
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:19,160
out. You have that Final Fantasy origin and chaos, chaos, chaos. Well, chaos was

458
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:26,920
a villain in Final Fantasy I. Also, Final Fantasy I didn't really have set protagonists.

459
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:32,600
Remember, you got to pick your party and who was in the party and whatever names you wanted

460
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:38,360
to give them. So the character design didn't really start until Final Fantasy II, which had

461
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:43,080
more defined characters. And I mean, Final Fantasy II on the NES actually had, you know, characters

462
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:47,080
that you played. It's just the job system was different. But Final Fantasy I was really,

463
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:52,280
the warriors of light could kind of be anybody. And so that might be, I mean, and sure, sure,

464
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:58,040
for the purposes of a story, give them defined roles. Make a black mage named whatever, a white,

465
00:40:58,040 --> 00:41:02,840
you know, make, make those characters. But I want to say, wasn't there a Final Fantasy anime a long

466
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:07,480
time ago that explored that already? It was based on V. It was based on Final Fantasy V. I don't

467
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:16,120
remember what, it wasn't called Final Fantasy, I don't think. It was like Legend of the Crystals

468
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:22,040
or something like that. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm trying to remember. Oh, no, it was, yeah,

469
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:28,040
Legend of the Crystals, Final Fantasy. That's what it was. So, yeah, I just think, not bad. Yeah,

470
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:31,720
I just think that might be the issue with trying to go all the way out to Final Fantasy I. And

471
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:36,440
as was said earlier there, they're going the game direction with that anyway. So maybe they just,

472
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:39,720
you know, since they have 15 Final Fantasy games, they're going to branch them out in all these

473
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:44,520
different directions. Where's the justice for Final Fantasy XI? Are they ever going to revisit

474
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:52,120
Final Fantasy XI? That's, that's my question at this point. Well, yeah, I don't know. Yeah.

475
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:59,960
Can we get a Dissida, like, anime or something like that? That would be interesting. No One

476
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:04,440
Special. That would be weird. That would be interesting. No One Special 77 in chat says,

477
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:08,440
with Final Fantasy I character names, they were limited to four characters a piece,

478
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:13,400
really limiting in English, but in Japanese, you can do more with the characters. So it was one of

479
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:21,160
those things that just didn't localize as well, especially for an old NES cart. So, Fifth Dream

480
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:26,680
in chat says, still waiting for the spirits within game. I, I still will die on the hill that spirits

481
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:30,040
within should have been Final Fantasy VIII and Final Fantasy VIII should have been the movie.

482
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:36,280
That's, I will find me a hill to go die on because that's it. So, all right. Anyway,

483
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:42,520
let's move on. Talk about another big Square series. How about the Mana series? And it's kind

484
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:47,160
of interesting because we've been kind of seeing more Mana games pop up, right? We had the secret

485
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:51,800
amount of remake not that long ago, Trials of Mana finally localized after all these years,

486
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:56,840
and then it gets a remake as well. Legend of Mana, for better or for worse, in my opinion,

487
00:42:57,400 --> 00:43:05,080
that remake just hit, right? So, what's happening with Mana next? Well, get this, producer Masaru

488
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:12,440
Oyamata confirmed during the 30th anniversary live stream that just happened that a new Mana series

489
00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:17,880
game for console is in development. I think they also announced one for phones and people were kind

490
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:23,640
of like, but there is one for consoles that is in development. And say, it's saying in the

491
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:28,440
announcement, we wanted to announce it by running a cool trailer, but we're only at the start of

492
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:34,200
the 30th anniversary, but we are in fact developing a new title, but please wait a little while longer

493
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:39,960
until the proper announcement. Although we did have the Mana series creator, Kochi Ishii, take

494
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:44,600
a look at it a little bit ago. We're at that level of development, so please look forward to it.

495
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:49,000
Development still has some way to go. We're developing for console, so I hope you can look

496
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:54,440
forward to it. So meaning, don't expect the game anytime soon. This is probably, honestly, a 2023

497
00:43:54,440 --> 00:44:01,480
game if nothing else. But still exciting to hear that because the Mana series has been doing so

498
00:44:01,480 --> 00:44:06,760
well in the remakes, not only do we finally get second at set to three after all these years

499
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:12,440
localized, but essentially we're getting second at set to five after all these years is basically

500
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:18,760
what they're making. And that's outstanding news. I have high hopes for this. What do you guys

501
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:25,080
think about a new Mana game coming? As long as it isn't like Trials of Mana. I'm not Trials of Mana,

502
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:32,760
but the last one. Legend of Mana. Legend of Mana, yeah. Which I kind of stupidly got in Japanese.

503
00:44:33,640 --> 00:44:40,840
Oh, I remember the story. Yeah. Yeah, and I just, I didn't enjoy it. I'm gonna be honest. I kind of

504
00:44:40,840 --> 00:44:46,120
want to give it another go. I kind of, because I remember I really didn't like it on PlayStation

505
00:44:46,120 --> 00:44:51,080
when it came out, but I can also admit it came out during a very different period in my life

506
00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:54,520
when what I was looking for in gaming was a little bit different and I was a little more maybe

507
00:44:54,520 --> 00:45:01,320
tunnel visioned. And so there is a part of me that wants to give it another go. So I'm on the fence,

508
00:45:01,320 --> 00:45:06,200
you guys. Send me, convince me. Send me your best tweet. Convince me to play Legend of Mana and give

509
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:11,880
the remake a try. Twitter.com slash Mr. Rob Roberts. How's that for a cheap plug? Love that.

510
00:45:12,440 --> 00:45:16,600
All right. Also, and I thought this was interesting because, and Jason kind of referenced

511
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:21,640
it in tonight's intro. He messaged me before the show. I hadn't heard this, but when he was putting

512
00:45:21,640 --> 00:45:27,720
the show roll together, he said, did you know they actually mentioned that there is also a

513
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:33,800
Legend of Mana, the teardrop crystal anime that's in the works. So there was a lot coming out of

514
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:39,400
this Mana 30th anniversary stream. And here we go. And we just talked about a Final Fantasy anime.

515
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:44,200
Guess what? Legend of Mana is getting an anime as well. And it doesn't really matter how I feel

516
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:48,840
about the game because animes aren't games. They're very different. Again, it could be a

517
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:54,040
very interesting way to tell the story. So it will be developed. It's going to be animated by

518
00:45:54,040 --> 00:45:59,880
Graffinica. I hope I said that right. In collaboration with Yokohama Animation Lab.

519
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:05,960
No release date yet, but producer Masaru Oyamata said about it. When the animation project was

520
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:09,960
first pitched to me, the remastering of Legend of Mana was not even in discussion.

521
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:14,440
I initially attended the meeting without deep thoughts, but when Mr. Iwata from Warner Brothers

522
00:46:14,440 --> 00:46:18,600
Japan passionately pitched the Legend of Mana animation project with so much love,

523
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:24,200
I realized I needed to create the game as soon as I can. So rumor has it, that's how the HD

524
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:30,120
remaster project began. That's very interesting. Fans of the Legend of Mana, please be assured

525
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:35,480
the people involved in the project have lots of love for the series. So that's pretty cool.

526
00:46:35,560 --> 00:46:40,680
That's very interesting that the discussion about the anime led to the game getting re-released

527
00:46:40,680 --> 00:46:46,040
after all. I just figured the Trials of Mana, the Secret of Mana and like those remakes just

528
00:46:46,040 --> 00:46:53,560
performed very well. So I guess my last question is, where's justice for Secret of Evermore? Look,

529
00:46:54,600 --> 00:47:00,440
look, Secret of Evermore, AKA, I think I have the cart around somewhere too. It's like one of the

530
00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:07,080
few carts I still have. More like Secret of Nevermore. Look, look, justice for Square USA,

531
00:47:07,080 --> 00:47:13,720
okay? Secret of Evermore was not as bad as everyone says it was. Like, I thought it was a,

532
00:47:13,720 --> 00:47:20,360
it was, I mean, was it the same? No, but I like the gameplay was very heavily inspired by

533
00:47:20,360 --> 00:47:23,960
Secret of Mana. And I liked the different direction that it went in. I kind of liked

534
00:47:23,960 --> 00:47:28,440
that it was set in a more modern day, you know, kind of setting a more relatable real world

535
00:47:28,440 --> 00:47:33,720
setting I thought was really cool. So yeah, where's my justice for Secret of Evermore?

536
00:47:33,720 --> 00:47:38,360
You're doing all these other remasters. Come on, come on, at least, at least put it on virtual

537
00:47:38,360 --> 00:47:45,640
console if nothing else. Anyway, DJ Rama S in chat highlights a message saying, Secret of Evermore

538
00:47:45,640 --> 00:47:51,800
goes on the shelf with Final Fantasy Mystic Quest. Well, then here I am walking up to DJ Rama S's

539
00:47:51,800 --> 00:47:56,680
shelf and taking those games off the shelf and putting them in my Super Nintendo to play Secret

540
00:47:56,680 --> 00:48:01,320
of Evermore and to listen to the music in Mystic Quest because that's really the only good part,

541
00:48:01,320 --> 00:48:08,200
but it still had really good music, okay? I'll play that game just to hear the music.

542
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:13,960
Is there any, is there any game that you will play even though you don't really care for the game

543
00:48:13,960 --> 00:48:19,800
just to hear the music? Chat or hosts, any game that you don't really care for the game,

544
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:21,960
but the music's so good, you'll play it anyway.

545
00:48:24,920 --> 00:48:32,040
Orange Wright says, Sonic R. I actually like Sonic R. Have fun with it.

546
00:48:33,560 --> 00:48:38,280
Bobby Blackwell says, Advent Rising. Oh, that's a good one. The early Xbox game. Heck yeah,

547
00:48:38,280 --> 00:48:44,520
Quest Buster agrees with that. Obi Wan Jibroni, Streets of Rage 2. Good call. I don't think those

548
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:48,280
Streets of Rage games have aged very well. Personally, it's a personal opinion, but the

549
00:48:48,280 --> 00:48:54,120
soundtracks, chef's kiss. I want a new Xenogears game. Is that something that we can do?

550
00:48:56,760 --> 00:49:04,760
Write a letter, tweet. We can try. E3VL. All these old Square franchises. I mean, why not?

551
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:11,880
E3VL in chat says, why not just listen to the OST? Look, I don't need your facts and analysis right

552
00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:17,240
now. I don't need your simple solution. Let me do it the complicated way.

553
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:24,440
I can think of a game, I really enjoyed the game, but it was hard as balls. And that was Solstice

554
00:49:24,440 --> 00:49:30,040
on the NES. And it had the most amazing soundtrack. I never got very far in the game,

555
00:49:30,040 --> 00:49:34,600
but I would play it just to hear the music. That's for sure. And especially back in the day when a

556
00:49:34,600 --> 00:49:38,760
lot of these games released, we weren't getting OSTs. I think that's also a big part of it.

557
00:49:39,640 --> 00:49:43,880
That was a Japan only thing. We didn't get them over here. And streaming media wasn't a thing

558
00:49:43,880 --> 00:49:49,800
yet. Hell, Napster wasn't a thing yet back when I first played Mystic Quest, that's for sure.

559
00:49:51,240 --> 00:49:59,400
I had friends that would make me cassette tapes of different soundtracks. I would get anime and

560
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:04,680
video game mix tapes. Didn't you do that on the internet? You dumped some stuff to the internet,

561
00:50:04,680 --> 00:50:10,920
like the early... Was it Bust a Move? Bust a Move. I dumped the track rips from Bust a Move.

562
00:50:10,920 --> 00:50:13,880
I thought that was the thing I remember you talking about in an earlier episode,

563
00:50:13,880 --> 00:50:19,720
way earlier episode. Yeah. So fun. I had what I think it was like a PSX viewer

564
00:50:20,520 --> 00:50:30,200
that lets you view the raw data on a PlayStation game disc. So that's how we also got all those

565
00:50:31,080 --> 00:50:37,640
Symphony of the Night quote lines and everything. That's how they found the unused evil Maria ending.

566
00:50:38,600 --> 00:50:43,480
Actually, now that I think about it, since it just got brought up, I will shut the fuck up

567
00:50:43,480 --> 00:50:49,080
completely about Secret of Evermore getting a remake if Square Enix will bring back Bust a Move.

568
00:50:50,680 --> 00:50:56,600
Because that was an Enix thing. So I'll give up my Secret of Evermore if it means a new Bust a Move.

569
00:50:56,600 --> 00:51:03,080
How about that? Let's move on. Dark Sakura, what else do we have? This is a really interesting

570
00:51:03,080 --> 00:51:18,920
story. So rightfully so, there's a lot of voice actors in arms over the advent of the AI voice

571
00:51:18,920 --> 00:51:29,480
actor. They're like, for example, Witcher 3, A Night to Remember has new voice lines, but it was

572
00:51:29,480 --> 00:51:43,000
used, well, that is it was done by a modder using basically a speech parody was what he calls it,

573
00:51:43,880 --> 00:51:55,080
that he was able to use an AI trained on the original voice actor's speech to create

574
00:51:55,080 --> 00:52:05,400
new lines. And so several voice actors are like, this is terrible. And a quote from Jay Britten,

575
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:14,840
who was a voice actor on Divinity Original Sin 2 and Pathfinder. I'll go ahead and read the quote.

576
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:19,400
Yes, AI might be able to replace things, but should it? We literally get to decide. Replacing

577
00:52:19,400 --> 00:52:28,760
actors with AI is not only a legal minefield, but an utterly soulless choice. And this basically came

578
00:52:28,760 --> 00:52:38,280
out after Obsidian, the developer, put a video out about it working with a semantic, which has

579
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:47,000
AI voices for placeholders until the voice actors are decided on to do their lines. That way,

580
00:52:47,560 --> 00:52:54,360
they can use it to check out dialogue, to check conversation flow, to do base animation,

581
00:52:54,600 --> 00:53:04,760
to the cadence of speech. And one of the voice actors, though, from Assassin's Creed Valhalla,

582
00:53:04,760 --> 00:53:11,880
Natalie Winter, her quote, though, is she says, there's this knee jerk concern of it's going to

583
00:53:11,880 --> 00:53:17,720
take our jobs. And I do believe in some cases that will happen. It's sad to think if AI voices become

584
00:53:17,720 --> 00:53:23,640
good enough to be widely used, then those opportunities will decrease again. And that's

585
00:53:23,640 --> 00:53:33,160
referring to the tight, tight competition as a video game voice actor. The modern question,

586
00:53:33,160 --> 00:53:37,080
though, who didn't like to remember, said he used software called Cyber Voice to create the

587
00:53:37,080 --> 00:53:44,680
new dialogue and the lines for Geralt. It's put out by a Russian company called Mind Simulation

588
00:53:44,680 --> 00:53:56,440
Lab. And they often use that software to mimic many voices. It's really,

589
00:54:00,200 --> 00:54:07,000
I would say, a very gray area right now, although a semantics CEO, Zina Qureshi,

590
00:54:08,760 --> 00:54:13,160
said, and this is her quote, if actors are not comfortable with something, then it's a no go. We

591
00:54:13,160 --> 00:54:18,440
take misuse very seriously. I'm sorry, that came actually. My apologies. I think that came from.

592
00:54:21,880 --> 00:54:29,160
Yeah, actually, that did come from her, so I'm sorry. But at any rate, they reached out to

593
00:54:29,160 --> 00:54:38,360
one of the spokespeople. And this is from an input magazine, by the way, from SAG-AFTRA Union about

594
00:54:38,360 --> 00:54:46,760
how it would affect an actor's credit. And they replied in email, it would be ultimately up to

595
00:54:46,760 --> 00:54:51,960
the actor as currently video game companies do not have a right to continue using a performer's voice

596
00:54:51,960 --> 00:54:57,800
to create something new without their permission. So it would be so SAG-AFTRA would negotiate for

597
00:54:57,800 --> 00:55:05,720
fair compensation if that came to the line. But there's nothing that prohibits anyone from

598
00:55:05,720 --> 00:55:17,960
synthesizing any voice. And indeed, some of these places are calling it parody to, I guess,

599
00:55:17,960 --> 00:55:26,440
get around. They're doing that to get away with it. Exactly. And on top of that, they're saying

600
00:55:26,440 --> 00:55:32,200
that no AI is perfect. You're not going to get spontaneity out of the voice or the essence of

601
00:55:32,200 --> 00:55:39,960
humanity as one quote. But I don't know, when I watched that video that was put out by Semantic,

602
00:55:40,760 --> 00:55:50,440
it was pretty expressive. And they're like, now we have screaming and this, that, and the other.

603
00:55:54,120 --> 00:55:59,480
But they're still thinking that it's a diminishment of their craft.

604
00:56:00,280 --> 00:56:07,480
I'm kind of with SAG-AFTRA on that. Yeah. And personally, now I look at it like this.

605
00:56:08,600 --> 00:56:20,200
Say that you have a finely woven Turkish rug, right? And the ones that take the thousands of

606
00:56:20,200 --> 00:56:27,720
dollars, they take up to a year to create. Now imagine you buy a rug that looks identical,

607
00:56:27,720 --> 00:56:33,400
that was just made in some factory. After a while, you're going to be able, you know,

608
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:37,640
you're going to hear, see degradation. You're going to hear degradation in the quality.

609
00:56:38,360 --> 00:56:46,200
And it's not, you would probably have to put more work into tweaking the vocal output to make it

610
00:56:46,200 --> 00:56:53,800
sound actually human than you would to pay your voice actor. And voice actors do not get paid as

611
00:56:53,800 --> 00:56:59,880
handsomely as one might think. And I know Quest Buster is bringing up a Vocaloids 2.0. This is

612
00:56:59,880 --> 00:57:10,280
completely different. Vocaloids are meant to sound digital. It is a synthesized voice. This is

613
00:57:10,280 --> 00:57:18,360
actually meant to completely mimic a human voice. And on top of that, certain human voices.

614
00:57:19,160 --> 00:57:23,320
I completely understand where SAG-AFTRA is coming from though, in saying that basically,

615
00:57:23,400 --> 00:57:28,200
and I think that the point for me is really the part where you don't have permission to use the

616
00:57:28,200 --> 00:57:33,240
voice actor's voice beyond what they were compensated for. So I mean, if a developer

617
00:57:33,240 --> 00:57:38,840
wants to keep using the voice and they're going to use this, you know, AI stuff to do it, then okay,

618
00:57:38,840 --> 00:57:44,600
but you need to compensate that voice actor. Now, I think that's being said, I think it's important

619
00:57:44,600 --> 00:57:49,320
to understand the perspective of this story is that you have an individual modder who kind of

620
00:57:49,320 --> 00:57:54,120
did this. This isn't like, it's not like CD Projekt RED did this. They didn't do that.

621
00:57:54,120 --> 00:57:59,880
And on top of that, they're anonymous. Yeah. So I kind of think just the good,

622
00:57:59,880 --> 00:58:04,680
decent thing to do, if you're an anonymous modder, who's going to do this kind of thing and put it

623
00:58:04,680 --> 00:58:09,160
out for free on the internet, I think if you go and make money off it, you're setting yourself

624
00:58:09,160 --> 00:58:14,280
up for trouble. If you're giving it away for free, I think you need to carry that disclaimer

625
00:58:14,280 --> 00:58:19,560
that says these voices are, you know, manipulated or whatever, you know, whatever the,

626
00:58:20,120 --> 00:58:23,080
an appropriate language would be there. I don't- Synthesized, I would say.

627
00:58:23,080 --> 00:58:28,600
Yeah. Synthesized or artificial. But I also completely, I know people may strongly disagree

628
00:58:28,600 --> 00:58:33,880
with me and say, Rob, it's not appropriate in any situation, but I'm also saying you're absolutely

629
00:58:33,880 --> 00:58:38,520
right, but that's not a realistic outlook on how the internet works. So if the technology is out

630
00:58:38,520 --> 00:58:42,760
there, people are going to use it. So we kind of need to find that common ground of especially

631
00:58:42,760 --> 00:58:48,600
the free modding stuff, what should they do? And I think a disclaimer is probably appropriate.

632
00:58:49,160 --> 00:58:53,240
Companies should use this under no circumstance, unless they're going to compensate the

633
00:58:53,960 --> 00:58:57,800
voice actors. And even- Well, it is impressive,

634
00:58:58,840 --> 00:59:08,760
you know, and I think that, I mean, we use a synthesized voice almost every day with,

635
00:59:09,320 --> 00:59:17,880
be it Siri or Alexa or Waze, you know, when you're using their mappy thing.

636
00:59:19,560 --> 00:59:23,560
Synthesized voice is all around us and the technology is getting better and better.

637
00:59:25,080 --> 00:59:33,400
I was listening to some of the synthesis that they did for WWDC for, you know, how Siri is

638
00:59:33,400 --> 00:59:42,840
supposed to sound in the future. And it was utterly amazing. I really think that with any

639
00:59:42,840 --> 00:59:48,600
technology, there's always room for abuse. And I also think that any company is going to try to

640
00:59:48,600 --> 00:59:57,320
save themselves some money when they can. At the same time, they need to be completely aware of the

641
00:59:57,320 --> 01:00:02,680
muck that they're stepping into. Right. Interesting perspective in chat.

642
01:00:02,680 --> 01:00:06,440
So a pod culture in chat says it would be great for things like Star Trek,

643
01:00:06,440 --> 01:00:12,520
where Majeel as the voice of the Enterprise is no longer with us. I support that if they're

644
01:00:12,520 --> 01:00:19,000
compensating her estate by continuing to use the voice. That's different. If her estate agrees to

645
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:23,000
it and says, yes, this is a nice way to carry the tradition and here's the coin we're going to get

646
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:30,040
from that, then I think it's OK. And it's not that different from movies that used footage of

647
01:00:30,040 --> 01:00:35,560
Marlon Brando to get him back in the Superman movie after he's been gone for years and years,

648
01:00:35,560 --> 01:00:39,160
you know, but I'm sure his estate got compensated for that. Exactly.

649
01:00:39,160 --> 01:00:45,240
That's what it's all about. So, you know, everything becoming more and more, you know,

650
01:00:45,800 --> 01:00:50,680
advanced, it's going to be interesting, especially with some of these, you know,

651
01:00:50,680 --> 01:00:54,520
folks that are going to pass on and they'll be back in movies again.

652
01:00:54,520 --> 01:00:58,840
Well, and I can I also completely understand from the voice actor and actress's perspective

653
01:00:58,840 --> 01:01:04,280
is that there may be language they don't want to say that then gets me like, for example,

654
01:01:04,280 --> 01:01:08,120
you know, we have what this is, eight hundred and seventy four episodes of Orange Lounge Radio.

655
01:01:08,120 --> 01:01:12,440
If somebody wanted to deconstruct our voices in one of these things, and I'm sure it's very easy

656
01:01:12,440 --> 01:01:19,080
to do, I would be very upset if my voice showed up saying things that I would not say. I would

657
01:01:19,080 --> 01:01:25,720
be very, very mad at that. So it's like it's really getting into murky territory.

658
01:01:25,720 --> 01:01:30,520
Yeah, absolutely. So like something something like you when you'd say like, you know,

659
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:35,800
Krenner Trigger is the best video game out there is better than Metroid.

660
01:01:35,800 --> 01:01:38,600
I would absolutely sue. I would absolutely sue. And honestly,

661
01:01:39,160 --> 01:01:42,520
that's what it's going to come down to. And that's when they're going to be able to say,

662
01:01:42,520 --> 01:01:47,560
no, this is not parody. When one of these games has a voice actor say something that is against

663
01:01:47,560 --> 01:01:50,440
because, you know, actors have the right to say, no, they're not going to do a certain line of

664
01:01:50,440 --> 01:01:54,200
dialogue or they're not going to do a certain thing. I'm going to tell you, that's going to be

665
01:01:54,200 --> 01:01:57,800
when one of these voice actors, you know, or somebody that gets deep faked with one of these

666
01:01:57,800 --> 01:02:03,080
things is going to go through the roof and sue somebody out of the universe for using something

667
01:02:03,080 --> 01:02:06,760
and saying something they would never say. So that that's will be what it comes down to.

668
01:02:07,560 --> 01:02:13,160
Now, one, though, there are there are some positive uses for this, like text to speech

669
01:02:13,160 --> 01:02:19,400
synthesis. Sure. Which I think is going into party chat on Xbox. I think it is. I think it

670
01:02:19,400 --> 01:02:26,440
just went in there recently. It might be a testing beta thing, but yeah. And I think that for people

671
01:02:26,440 --> 01:02:32,920
who have trouble speaking, like imagine that you have a nonverbal autistic person, they could very

672
01:02:32,920 --> 01:02:40,440
well use speech synthesis to have a voice design their own virtual voice. I mean, imagine what

673
01:02:40,440 --> 01:02:46,120
would have happened if Stephen Hawking had this. Sure. But the voice would have had MC Hawking,

674
01:02:46,120 --> 01:02:51,400
but still the voices in those situations would probably be well aware they're donating

675
01:02:51,400 --> 01:02:56,760
themselves to medicine or getting compensated or whatever the case may be. So in those situations,

676
01:02:56,760 --> 01:03:03,480
like I'm sure there is, you know, some type of consent from the voice to actually to actually

677
01:03:03,480 --> 01:03:09,160
do that, like Siri's voice or any automated assistance voice. Right. They get they get

678
01:03:09,160 --> 01:03:16,520
compensated for that. So anyway. Let's see. Oh, that's interesting. Bobby Black Wolf says

679
01:03:16,520 --> 01:03:21,800
Stephen Hawking actually chose to keep the robotic voice even when they synthesized his real voice.

680
01:03:21,800 --> 01:03:27,560
I can understand why, though. Yeah. I mean, that was for all intents and purposes,

681
01:03:27,560 --> 01:03:33,160
his voice at that point. Right. So and again, all these things are, you know, if the voice

682
01:03:33,160 --> 01:03:38,040
actor agrees, if the person that is to use it agrees. And in that case, Stephen Hawking's

683
01:03:38,040 --> 01:03:45,240
didn't agree. So that was it. So anyway. All right. So, yeah, I think this I think this is

684
01:03:45,240 --> 01:03:50,040
one of the things that's kind of going to remain interesting while a modder uses it. But again,

685
01:03:50,040 --> 01:03:54,680
the first time somebody says something they would never say otherwise gets put out there.

686
01:03:55,960 --> 01:04:01,960
It's going to get ugly real quick. All right. Let's move on. Talk about our next story. Loki.

687
01:04:02,920 --> 01:04:10,440
Yeah, so this is fun, I guess. So we kind of knew that this was going to be happening sooner or

688
01:04:10,440 --> 01:04:18,920
later. But Facebook is testing VR ads in different games. So one of the first games to kind of test

689
01:04:18,920 --> 01:04:25,080
out this brand new type of in game advertising is a game called Blaston, which is on the Oculus

690
01:04:25,080 --> 01:04:32,360
Quest. And as such, there's been massive backlash against it. So finally, you know,

691
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:40,840
the devs behind it resolution games have decided to pull out of that testing program, basically

692
01:04:40,840 --> 01:04:44,520
saying after listening to player feedback, we realized blastin isn't the best fit for this

693
01:04:44,520 --> 01:04:50,520
type of advertising test. Therefore, we no longer plan to implement the test. But you know, people

694
01:04:50,600 --> 01:04:54,600
have been just saying, Listen, you know, I'm not going to buy your game, I'm going to refund it,

695
01:04:54,600 --> 01:05:01,720
I'm going to, you know, throw away my quest. I lots of crazy stuff, but it's coming. I mean,

696
01:05:01,720 --> 01:05:07,000
they're testing it. We knew that when Facebook was buying Oculus that this is what's going to happen

697
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:12,520
tracking and ads. So yeah. And I actually think it's unfortunate, I actually think this story

698
01:05:12,520 --> 01:05:17,400
has nothing to do with VR as much as I mean, it's just it just so happens this game is a VR game,

699
01:05:17,400 --> 01:05:22,760
as much as it has to do with Facebook getting into VR and what people's apprehensions were

700
01:05:22,760 --> 01:05:27,400
about that in the first place. Because remember, this isn't just about showing you ads in the game

701
01:05:27,400 --> 01:05:33,800
that you've already purchased. It's about showing you curated and targeted ads. And that's where

702
01:05:33,800 --> 01:05:39,560
that's where the real sinisterness of this comes out is that 10 by the way, it's not a free play

703
01:05:39,560 --> 01:05:44,600
game or anything like that. It's a game that you bought. And then they're sneaking not just not

704
01:05:44,600 --> 01:05:48,920
just any ad, because a lot of the stuff you play on like PlayStation, like let's say you bought

705
01:05:48,920 --> 01:05:53,960
because honestly, people are taking issue with this in other games to like Street Fighter five,

706
01:05:53,960 --> 01:05:58,120
you will sometimes load up a match and it's a match presented by you know, such as Oh,

707
01:05:58,120 --> 01:06:02,600
gosh, yeah, where they like skin everything. Yeah, I remember talking about that even when

708
01:06:02,600 --> 01:06:06,840
it was just like a Capcom fighting tournament or something, but like kind of where it's going to go.

709
01:06:06,840 --> 01:06:12,520
Now, let's just say now, resolution games hasn't necessarily backed out completely attesting these

710
01:06:12,520 --> 01:06:19,320
ads. So they've moved the test from the blast into bait, which is a free to play fishing game

711
01:06:19,320 --> 01:06:25,080
that they released back in 2019. So they're still doing the test. But I mean, it seems more

712
01:06:25,080 --> 01:06:31,080
appropriate in a free to play game. But still, though, it's like, I don't know. I mean, I know

713
01:06:31,080 --> 01:06:36,440
they're throwing money at these devs, obviously. So it's good money for them. But it's also I don't

714
01:06:36,520 --> 01:06:42,040
that's gross. It's Facebook. I just don't like it. You said that game is called Bait.

715
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:50,360
Bait. It's bait bait. So. So Facebook's want to know, do you like to bait?

716
01:06:52,440 --> 01:06:59,080
All right. Let's see other comments in chat. Fifth Dream says I block everything to master

717
01:06:59,080 --> 01:07:04,840
that game. But, you know, keep trying. Keep keep keep keep practicing a bait.

718
01:07:06,120 --> 01:07:12,840
One day you'll masturbate. Fifth Dream in chat says I block everything on Facebook except people

719
01:07:12,840 --> 01:07:18,040
or groups I follow. So I don't know what they think I like, but I'm obviously not interacting

720
01:07:18,040 --> 01:07:22,680
with ads. Zen Monkey in chat says they backed out. What they're probably going to do is make

721
01:07:22,680 --> 01:07:29,560
people buy loot in games. So, yeah. And this is I think even the people that we're trying to say,

722
01:07:29,560 --> 01:07:34,440
oh, well, maybe Facebook's getting into this, you know, to bring more real life things into VR and

723
01:07:34,440 --> 01:07:38,200
that we're giving Facebook the benefit of the doubt. Now that this is happening, it's like

724
01:07:39,480 --> 01:07:44,840
fucking Facebook sucks. Fuck them. So there's there's that as well. But the problem is, I think

725
01:07:44,840 --> 01:07:49,560
even if you like block things on Facebook, Facebook puts tracking things in other things

726
01:07:49,560 --> 01:07:54,120
around the Internet. So it still figures out a way to follow you. Yeah, because even if you

727
01:07:54,120 --> 01:07:58,440
don't have a Facebook account, they still have these like shell accounts that they

728
01:07:59,480 --> 01:08:06,040
come up with, you know, stuff based on your tracking stuff. So, yeah, it's I have a nice

729
01:08:06,040 --> 01:08:10,920
plug in that pretty much blocks most of that. A couple of others that I've been using. Well,

730
01:08:10,920 --> 01:08:15,880
I'm I'm really glad that other companies, too, are starting to step up and give the people what they

731
01:08:15,880 --> 01:08:22,680
want. And that's enhanced privacy, such as Apple's newest iOS that basically, you know, Facebook

732
01:08:22,680 --> 01:08:27,080
literally was kicking and screaming on the table over that privacy update because they knew

733
01:08:27,080 --> 01:08:31,400
it was going to, you know, really kick them. It's going to fuck them up. It's going to fuck up what

734
01:08:31,400 --> 01:08:39,240
their whole business is about. Good. Very good. And I hope more people kind of take, you know,

735
01:08:39,240 --> 01:08:42,520
following us. You know, so interesting. I saw a giant bill since I was driving home from the

736
01:08:42,520 --> 01:08:47,400
Bay today, I saw a giant billboard on the road home advertising, I think Duk Duk Goose,

737
01:08:47,400 --> 01:08:53,480
one of those companies. Yeah. That actually says, you know, go is that I'm sorry, go. Yeah,

738
01:08:53,480 --> 01:09:00,520
I called it Duk Duk Goose. Well, whatever. So I met you, man. Clearly, clearly the billboard

739
01:09:00,520 --> 01:09:08,840
worked on me. Can you get on the Internet's and find me Duk Duk Goose? Anyway, so whatever it is

740
01:09:08,840 --> 01:09:14,680
called Duk Duk Go, fine. There's a, they have an ad where it's like, do you want more privacy

741
01:09:14,680 --> 01:09:19,640
online? Or it's for people who value the privacy online. It's like, why don't you just say for

742
01:09:19,640 --> 01:09:23,560
people that want to give the middle finger to fucking Zuckerberg? Why don't they just say that

743
01:09:23,560 --> 01:09:30,600
on the billboard? Cause I'd buy, I'd probably remember the name if it had said that. Anyway.

744
01:09:30,600 --> 01:09:36,280
All right. Enough about why Facebook irritates me, but you know what? I got a lot of likes on

745
01:09:36,280 --> 01:09:41,880
the selfie I posted yesterday, so I guess these are the things I give up to have that attention.

746
01:09:41,880 --> 01:09:49,240
Well, and Duk Duk Go is one of the built-in preferences for search engines in Safari.

747
01:09:49,960 --> 01:09:56,200
Oh, I didn't know that. That's cool. Yeah, it is. All right. Let's move on and talk about Tekken

748
01:09:56,200 --> 01:10:00,280
Cross Street Fighter. Did you know that Tekken Cross Street Fighter is still a thing we're

749
01:10:00,280 --> 01:10:06,120
talking about in 2021? Because I bet like me, you pretty much figured this game was dead and

750
01:10:06,120 --> 01:10:11,880
they just never really announced it. And as it turns out, that was kind of the case. It's

751
01:10:11,880 --> 01:10:18,600
interesting. I realize this story has been updated, so please let me hear me out, folks.

752
01:10:18,600 --> 01:10:24,120
So originally what happened earlier this week is that there was a report that came out that

753
01:10:24,680 --> 01:10:30,280
Tekken development chief Katsuhiro Harada mentioned on his YouTube, Harada's Bar,

754
01:10:30,280 --> 01:10:35,560
that Tekken Cross Street Fighter was about 30% done when it was canceled, which we kind of all

755
01:10:35,560 --> 01:10:43,160
figured happened. Like the minute I saw Akuma show up in Tekken 7, I was like,

756
01:10:43,160 --> 01:10:47,880
that's all the Tekken Street Fighter you're going to get. That's what happened to Tekken

757
01:10:47,880 --> 01:10:53,160
Cross Street Fighter. That's it. There it is. Enjoy it. But yeah, apparently the game had

758
01:10:53,160 --> 01:10:58,600
been in development. It was about 30% done and then it was canceled according to this YouTube.

759
01:10:58,600 --> 01:11:05,160
But I'm sure some of you know, there was a follow-up where Katsuhiro Harada kind of clarified

760
01:11:05,160 --> 01:11:11,480
some of those comments saying that the English subtitles didn't properly translate what he was

761
01:11:11,480 --> 01:11:18,680
trying to say in Japanese. So he said that the game is in a pending state or on pause.

762
01:11:18,680 --> 01:11:24,280
So what he meant to say was up to 30% of the development was in progress, but now it is still

763
01:11:24,280 --> 01:11:29,320
pending. This is still the status of the project and we are still hopeful that Tekken Cross Street

764
01:11:29,320 --> 01:11:33,880
Fighter will resume development when the opportunity arises. However, such a title cannot

765
01:11:33,880 --> 01:11:38,040
be moved just for the convenience of one company in terms of marketing and branding. And it also

766
01:11:38,040 --> 01:11:42,440
affects each other's development resources. For now, we're just waiting for the right opportunity.

767
01:11:42,440 --> 01:11:47,800
Look, nothing but respect for Katsuhiro Harada and this project that he's working on in a game

768
01:11:47,800 --> 01:11:53,160
I would have really loved to see. But like when you put a project on pause like that for an

769
01:11:53,160 --> 01:11:59,000
indefinite period of time, when you don't know when it's restarting again, that's canceled.

770
01:11:59,560 --> 01:12:05,880
Or it becomes another game. The game was canceled. Yeah. So, you know, we're getting into a

771
01:12:05,880 --> 01:12:11,560
terminology war here, but it's not to say, and I think this is very important. It's not to say that

772
01:12:11,560 --> 01:12:20,760
a canceled game will never show up again. Metroid Dread is calling. Ring, ring. You just saw that

773
01:12:20,760 --> 01:12:25,320
a couple of weeks ago. That was a canceled game. I was going to say Star Fox 2. Oh, there you go.

774
01:12:25,320 --> 01:12:30,600
There's another one. Absolutely. So it's not that canceled games will never see the light of day.

775
01:12:31,560 --> 01:12:36,360
It's just it was. And how many of us had burned copies of Thrill Kill?

776
01:12:37,640 --> 01:12:45,160
That was pretty much finished. Oh boy. No one special 77 in chat says odds are we'll see

777
01:12:45,160 --> 01:12:50,360
Half-Life 3 before we see Tekken Cross Street Fighter. I have two answers for that. Number

778
01:12:50,360 --> 01:12:56,680
one, you already saw Half-Life 3. It's called Half-Life Alyx. Number two, I actually think

779
01:12:56,680 --> 01:13:02,280
you'll see Tekken Cross Street Fighter first, because I think it's interesting that this renewed

780
01:13:02,280 --> 01:13:06,760
interest in it could be interesting. I'm not saying it's going to make just because this

781
01:13:06,760 --> 01:13:12,280
happens is going to make it happen. But I do think there's kind of a renewed interest in it. And

782
01:13:13,160 --> 01:13:17,640
you never know. You never know. Like I said, nothing gets canceled forever. But I do think

783
01:13:17,640 --> 01:13:23,400
Half-Life 3 just isn't happening at this point or Half-Life exists in other stories such as Half-Life

784
01:13:23,400 --> 01:13:27,560
Alyx that they did not want to call Half-Life 3 because then people would have been blue in the

785
01:13:27,560 --> 01:13:34,760
face angry about Half-Life 3 as VR only. So anyway, compliment from a fifth dream in your

786
01:13:34,760 --> 01:13:40,200
chat on your nails saying nice color. Thank you for the podcast, folks. Dark Soccer showed off

787
01:13:40,200 --> 01:13:45,240
her nails on cam, which were I was kind of painting them because they were looking kind of

788
01:13:45,240 --> 01:13:51,080
gross. So is that like a metallic purple? I can't. It's hard for me. It's actually a holographic

789
01:13:51,080 --> 01:13:59,560
purple. OK, so it it'll it'll be all hollow when it's dried. OK, very cool. All right. Let's move

790
01:13:59,560 --> 01:14:05,160
on. I think we have Dark Soccer with another story. We do. And it's another Whopper. All

791
01:14:05,160 --> 01:14:12,600
right, everybody, time to whip out your brain. Well, not literally. Well, there are people who

792
01:14:13,560 --> 01:14:19,880
to to quote the the scarecrow, a lot of people without brains do an awful lot of talking.

793
01:14:19,880 --> 01:14:26,280
Was it was anyway, wasn't that the ending to Hannibal? Moving on. No, I don't remember. I

794
01:14:26,280 --> 01:14:31,000
didn't watch actually I didn't watch Hannibal. I just watched, you know, Silence of Lambs.

795
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:35,480
I did because I love Julianne more. And I remember just thinking the whole time what.

796
01:14:35,480 --> 01:14:45,640
Anyway, so there are different things that gaming can do to your brain.

797
01:14:48,200 --> 01:14:51,800
Now, they bring up World of Warcraft for a big one, for people who are addicted to their MMOs,

798
01:14:51,800 --> 01:15:01,960
right? But there's a reason people call it World of Warcrack, right? And now you remember when I

799
01:15:01,960 --> 01:15:06,840
was playing it, I was way into it. I did nothing but play well. I think we were kind of all in

800
01:15:06,840 --> 01:15:13,560
that at one point, right? Addict. Well, yeah, but we were kind of addicted to it, right?

801
01:15:13,560 --> 01:15:21,000
A little bit. Yeah, I think so. But it is. So I'm going to go through different things for

802
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:27,720
video games and we're going to start with addiction. So Mark, I think it's Palau,

803
01:15:28,280 --> 01:15:38,440
who has a PhD in cognitive neuroscience. He says that one aspect to understand how addictions work

804
01:15:38,440 --> 01:15:44,600
is the reward system of the brain. The reward system mediates how pleasant stimuli, such as

805
01:15:44,600 --> 01:15:49,560
the presence of food, water, social interaction, blah, blah, blah, acts as positive reinforcers

806
01:15:49,560 --> 01:15:54,600
for the behavior. So when we're exposed to that pleasurable thing, we want it more and more,

807
01:15:54,600 --> 01:16:05,000
like with a drug, right? And so there's now support groups for recovering from video game

808
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:16,440
addiction, or from being addicted to MMOs and stuff, right? So they are now going into

809
01:16:17,080 --> 01:16:26,440
the quick hits, more like the instant dopamine, right? So talking about things like Fortnite,

810
01:16:27,560 --> 01:16:37,400
where your games are quick like that, for us, even Dead by Daylight, what these do

811
01:16:37,400 --> 01:16:44,920
is it's going to give you just that quick release of dopamine. The neurotransmitter that goes,

812
01:16:44,920 --> 01:16:51,880
oh, happy, happy brain, happy. And then after, you know, your match and whichever game that

813
01:16:51,880 --> 01:16:56,920
you're playing, you know, the more dopamine that gets released, the better you feel and

814
01:16:56,920 --> 01:17:08,600
the greater your desire to play another. So. I have absolutely noticed the effect of Dead

815
01:17:08,600 --> 01:17:14,120
by Daylight specifically since you brought that up. Not so much on the brain part that you're

816
01:17:14,120 --> 01:17:18,760
talking about, but my heart rate, because, you know, when you wear one of these smartwatches,

817
01:17:18,760 --> 01:17:22,520
it's taking your heart rate all the time. And I absolutely notice when I'm playing survivor

818
01:17:22,520 --> 01:17:27,240
matches that are intense, I'm getting chased and, you know, and all that stuff. Like I look at my

819
01:17:27,240 --> 01:17:30,840
log and I can tell what points of the day I was playing Dead by Daylight because my heart rate

820
01:17:30,840 --> 01:17:34,360
literally goes up. It's fascinating. I should check what mine is, is killer.

821
01:17:34,360 --> 01:17:39,960
Yeah. Same thing happens to me is killer. I don't feel much the same way. I just get angry,

822
01:17:40,040 --> 01:17:45,400
insulting. You should add it to your streams, like add it as a thing. I used to do that with EDR.

823
01:17:46,840 --> 01:17:51,960
So with mine, like with my Fitbit, they have a Bluetooth thing. You're supposed to be able to

824
01:17:51,960 --> 01:17:56,840
sync it to your PC and be able to display that. And I do a screen capture, but that never worked.

825
01:17:56,840 --> 01:18:03,560
So I had to always screen. I had my phone with the app open and then I had a piece of software

826
01:18:03,560 --> 01:18:09,000
that screen captured the phone and put it into a window and I screen captured that and added

827
01:18:09,080 --> 01:18:13,160
to OBS. And so that actually worked for DDR, but I mean, that would probably work for Dead

828
01:18:13,160 --> 01:18:15,400
by Daylight too. Yeah. Interesting.

829
01:18:15,400 --> 01:18:23,720
Well, I know that there are ways of, I mean, you can, you can definitely have your,

830
01:18:24,840 --> 01:18:30,360
there's ways of streaming your iPhone, for example, and your watch syncs directly to your iPhone.

831
01:18:30,360 --> 01:18:35,880
So just saying, but anyway, going into a little bit more about that.

832
01:18:36,840 --> 01:18:42,360
There, there, this, this level of research that they're doing is still clearly in its infancy,

833
01:18:42,360 --> 01:18:49,320
like very early. And, you know, the biggest things that people are in power anywhere focusing on is

834
01:18:49,320 --> 01:18:55,640
that aspect of addiction. You know, they're always wanting to control what makes people happy,

835
01:18:56,360 --> 01:19:04,920
but, and also they do it under the guise of, is this good for people, for example. And I agree

836
01:19:05,720 --> 01:19:11,800
there are like legit places that are afraid of, of how it's going to affect the brain,

837
01:19:11,800 --> 01:19:17,800
but it can also be a really good tool for improving your cognitive skills.

838
01:19:17,800 --> 01:19:24,120
Now for when the research began in the nineties, the biggest thing that they were talking about

839
01:19:24,760 --> 01:19:30,680
was neuroplasticity, which is a process where the brain changes and adapts when exposed to new

840
01:19:30,680 --> 01:19:35,880
experiences. And the biggest thing, of course, they were talking about was hand-eye coordination.

841
01:19:36,440 --> 01:19:42,680
You know, for example, how if, you know, when they were using Doom and Team Fortress to,

842
01:19:43,800 --> 01:19:50,760
to do the test with, they published in 2016 of Scientific American, that individuals,

843
01:19:50,760 --> 01:19:53,800
I'm going to quote here, individuals who regularly play action games demonstrate

844
01:19:53,800 --> 01:19:58,760
improved ability to focus on visual details using useful for reading a fine print,

845
01:19:58,760 --> 01:20:02,840
illegal document or on a prescription bottle. They also display heightened sensitivity to

846
01:20:02,840 --> 01:20:07,880
visual contrast important when driving in thick fog, the multitasking required to switch back

847
01:20:07,880 --> 01:20:12,280
and forth between reading a menu and holding a conversation with the dinner partner also comes

848
01:20:12,280 --> 01:20:19,080
more easily. Video with this Wired article that I'm getting a lot from actually put some of that

849
01:20:19,080 --> 01:20:25,480
into action with a light board where people have to hit the lights as they pop up.

850
01:20:26,440 --> 01:20:30,920
And of course the pro gamer was better than the casual gamer.

851
01:20:34,120 --> 01:20:45,000
So there's also from a Ted talk called Your Brain on Video Games. They talk about how

852
01:20:48,200 --> 01:20:52,680
instead of, you know, what parents are saying that their kids are becoming a virtual zombie,

853
01:20:53,320 --> 01:21:01,080
it's, it's boosting their brain activity. There's also another study from UC Irvine that showed that

854
01:21:01,080 --> 01:21:05,960
3D games can improve functioning of the hippocampus, which is the part of the brain

855
01:21:05,960 --> 01:21:12,040
that is used in learning and memory. Researchers from Queen Mary University of London and University

856
01:21:12,040 --> 01:21:16,920
College London found that video games can aid mental agility and enhance strategic thinking,

857
01:21:17,880 --> 01:21:27,640
which also, you know, goes back to a UX designer and gamer named James Mitchell who stated that

858
01:21:27,640 --> 01:21:31,800
his critical thinking and strategy improved and he finds it easier to predict certain movements.

859
01:21:32,680 --> 01:21:37,000
I've even noticed just with me getting back into playing like Dead by Daylight

860
01:21:37,960 --> 01:21:47,960
that my reaction time in driving is better. Like I was on my breaks like really, really quickly

861
01:21:47,960 --> 01:21:54,760
when someone, not someone, but it was a dog ran out in front of me in the neighborhood. I mean,

862
01:21:54,760 --> 01:22:00,360
I was on it. I really felt that it was faster than how I might have been before. You know,

863
01:22:01,320 --> 01:22:07,160
despite having almost broken my hand, I've found that I'm quick to find things that are out of

864
01:22:07,160 --> 01:22:12,600
place. Like when my glasses fell off my bedside table, normally I'm fumbling around for a little

865
01:22:12,600 --> 01:22:16,680
bit, but I happened to catch just a pale glint of light off of them in the dark and I found my

866
01:22:16,680 --> 01:22:25,080
glasses. And I don't know, I want to say that my ability to notice things, and I already had a

867
01:22:25,080 --> 01:22:30,120
pretty decent ability to see things that a lot of people around me didn't see, but I think that's

868
01:22:30,200 --> 01:22:35,320
gotten even better. So maybe there was something to that whole hand-eye coordination argument we

869
01:22:35,320 --> 01:22:42,040
used to use with our parents on why video games were good. Exactly. And I'm on top. Yeah. Well,

870
01:22:42,040 --> 01:22:49,720
and the research is showing that you can become mentally more resilient, a faster thinker,

871
01:22:49,720 --> 01:22:59,080
and even smarter in general, in real life. Oh, there was another one in there that also was

872
01:22:59,080 --> 01:23:06,200
referring to the physical effects on the body as well. Like they had them play, do this thing

873
01:23:06,200 --> 01:23:10,520
where you have to keep tapping on a green dot no matter what the voice you're hearing through

874
01:23:10,520 --> 01:23:15,960
headphones is telling you. And that it actually builds up an anxiety response and the body reacts

875
01:23:15,960 --> 01:23:22,440
to that. Your heart's racing by the time you're done with it. And just, and you were like, you

876
01:23:22,440 --> 01:23:28,040
were saying with noticing your heart rate, you know, with your Apple watch. They're in these

877
01:23:28,040 --> 01:23:32,760
experiences that we're having that are building the brain. Our bodies are physically reacting to

878
01:23:32,760 --> 01:23:39,560
it. Now it's not going to be a replacement for taking a walk or lifting weights or doing some

879
01:23:39,560 --> 01:23:47,800
physical activity, but your body is still building from it as well as your brain. So keep that in

880
01:23:47,800 --> 01:23:52,440
mind. Um, I really liked this comment from Questbuster in our chat over twitch.tv slash

881
01:23:52,440 --> 01:23:57,720
vog network, who says one story I like to go back to on games benefiting mental health is from a

882
01:23:57,720 --> 01:24:02,680
story I dug up from the eighties when a psychologist related their experience on using wizardry

883
01:24:02,680 --> 01:24:06,920
to help troubled children break out of their shells when they talked about the characters

884
01:24:06,920 --> 01:24:13,960
they made, uh, clarifying wizard, the CRPG, not actual wizardry. Yo wizard Questbuster.

885
01:24:15,480 --> 01:24:20,360
I don't know, but I'm oddly thinking of the episode of supernatural where the kid doesn't

886
01:24:20,360 --> 01:24:27,000
want to talk to Sam or Dean. And so, uh, Garth brings out his sock puppet. Um, and the kid will

887
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:32,520
talk to the sock puppet. Hey, since you brought it up before we go to our next story, cause I

888
01:24:32,520 --> 01:24:36,280
know somebody is going to ask cause I've seen it on our vog network discord. I'm not sure how often

889
01:24:36,280 --> 01:24:40,920
you're you're in there, but somebody had tagged you in a, um, there's a supernatural prequel in

890
01:24:40,920 --> 01:24:48,600
the works. Your thoughts quickly. All right. So I'm going to put it this way. I would probably

891
01:24:48,600 --> 01:24:56,200
check it out. Okay. Yeah. But there are all these people up in arms over their dad being super

892
01:24:56,200 --> 01:25:01,480
abusive because he was taking out his trauma and pain and ignoring his kids and treating them like

893
01:25:01,480 --> 01:25:09,480
something. I'm not going to get into that argument. I, I could say a lot about inherited trauma,

894
01:25:10,920 --> 01:25:16,840
but, um, and tiger call, don't even bother telling me anything about the supernatural

895
01:25:16,840 --> 01:25:24,040
thing and how the actors reacted because I saw it. Um, I know that, uh, Jared posted his,

896
01:25:24,040 --> 01:25:31,560
he played Sam posted his surprise and dismay at not having been told about it because the

897
01:25:31,560 --> 01:25:35,960
production company behind this is owned by Jensen Ackles and his wife, Danielle. Um,

898
01:25:37,320 --> 01:25:41,640
they're the ones that are behind this, but you know, apparently they talked about things are

899
01:25:41,640 --> 01:25:45,560
cool again and people are going to react to the way they're going to react. I mean, I,

900
01:25:45,560 --> 01:25:49,560
it wouldn't be the first time somebody has blown up about something on the internet that they were

901
01:25:49,560 --> 01:25:53,080
kind of pissed about and then kind of regretted it later. You know, this happens all the time

902
01:25:53,080 --> 01:25:57,400
with movie remakes too. Like the original stars aren't consulted about the movie remakes. They

903
01:25:57,400 --> 01:26:01,240
just find out in the papers like everyone else does, Oh, they're remaking this movie. I was

904
01:26:01,240 --> 01:26:07,880
started in the eighties. Same, same thing. Well, and that's the, that's the thing about it,

905
01:26:07,880 --> 01:26:18,920
you know, and I, there are groups in Twitter that I am, I'd say peripherally part of, but I am the

906
01:26:18,920 --> 01:26:26,600
person that waits for fact. I try not to have an immediate emotional reaction to it. And I don't

907
01:26:27,240 --> 01:26:38,600
look into it as a point as an excuse to attack somebody. There's no point in attacking somebody,

908
01:26:38,600 --> 01:26:45,320
attacking a fucking character, attacking the actors, dragging people through the mud

909
01:26:45,320 --> 01:26:52,680
over fiction. Don't say anything about it until it's out until you have something to actually

910
01:26:52,680 --> 01:26:57,800
talk about. Okay. All right. Let's move on to our next story. Got to get it back to gaming.

911
01:26:57,800 --> 01:27:02,440
I had to do the quick aside though, cause we all know you, you love Supernatural. And when I saw

912
01:27:02,440 --> 01:27:07,960
that, uh, story this week, I was like, Ooh, I wonder what the opinion is. So, all right. Uh,

913
01:27:07,960 --> 01:27:15,640
Loki. So, uh, it looks like that we're going to be getting an update to the X cloud, um,

914
01:27:16,360 --> 01:27:23,320
game streaming. So before they were streaming that the quality of like, say an Xbox, uh, one level

915
01:27:23,320 --> 01:27:29,720
of performance, but now it's actually going to be upgraded to Xbox series X quality. Um,

916
01:27:29,720 --> 01:27:35,000
that's going to be going to Android and PC devices right now. Uh, they're still testing

917
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:40,280
the Xbox consoles, but that's nice to see that bump in quality though. Um,

918
01:27:40,280 --> 01:27:43,800
especially with games like, you know, for the horizon five or in around the corner,

919
01:27:44,520 --> 01:27:51,000
that should be pretty exciting. So, uh, yeah, looking forward to checking that out. I haven't

920
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:56,120
actually used the streaming, um, yet just because I have all of my stuff natively on my concert,

921
01:27:56,120 --> 01:28:03,160
my PC, but sounds cool. I literally thought the cloud was already working this way is that was

922
01:28:03,160 --> 01:28:07,480
the most surprising to me. I mean, I haven't been special enough to get a beta into this or

923
01:28:07,480 --> 01:28:11,400
whatever. So I've been able to check it out myself, but I was kind of surprised it wasn't

924
01:28:11,400 --> 01:28:16,840
already running on the series X quality. Why the hell wouldn't it? I like, it's just, it's, it's,

925
01:28:16,840 --> 01:28:20,680
it's a little, I'm sorry. I mean, I don't, it's just a little shocking to me. It took them nine

926
01:28:20,680 --> 01:28:26,440
months after the release of the console for, you know, the general public to put it on the cloud,

927
01:28:26,440 --> 01:28:32,120
like way to demonstrate that the cloud is going to lag behind. I just, I think hopefully this is

928
01:28:32,120 --> 01:28:36,920
the last sort of thing like this by Microsoft, because I sort of feel like if they want the

929
01:28:36,920 --> 01:28:43,720
cloud to be competitive, the cloud has to be cutting edge and not lagging behind. It's just

930
01:28:43,720 --> 01:28:50,360
weird to me. I don't understand why they did that approach. I don't know either testing, blah, blah,

931
01:28:50,360 --> 01:28:54,360
blah, whatever. Maybe it could, it's just a little, little weird to me, but all right.

932
01:28:55,240 --> 01:29:00,360
So, uh, you know, cause inevitably micro inevitably Microsoft will put out another

933
01:29:00,360 --> 01:29:04,840
console, the series Y or a different, you know, a different family altogether.

934
01:29:04,840 --> 01:29:09,720
Although they'll think of another dumb name for it, but yeah, it'll be something like that.

935
01:29:09,720 --> 01:29:14,120
Whatever it is. If they really want to make impress people with it,

936
01:29:14,120 --> 01:29:18,920
they really should put it on the cloud sooner so people can get a taste of it, honestly. But I,

937
01:29:20,120 --> 01:29:26,440
that's just my opinion, I guess. So yeah. All right. Uh, moving on, let's talk about

938
01:29:26,440 --> 01:29:33,800
the next Yakuza game. Uh, let's talk about that because, uh, I believe we know that there is a,

939
01:29:33,800 --> 01:29:39,160
where there's different, um, series, you know, the Yakuza has got, uh, the, um, judgment kind

940
01:29:39,160 --> 01:29:42,920
of spinoff that's going on now, because I believe the mainline games are going to follow a little

941
01:29:42,920 --> 01:29:47,640
more in the tradition of like a dragon. Whereas the judgment games will go a little more in the,

942
01:29:47,640 --> 01:29:54,520
um, the, the, the more traditional, uh, step. Um, so, uh, in the Yakuza series,

943
01:29:54,520 --> 01:30:00,920
they've usually had playable versions of classic Sega games, and usually these are arcade classics.

944
01:30:00,920 --> 01:30:07,960
However, lost judgment is going to be going a little different direction. Um, and, uh,

945
01:30:07,960 --> 01:30:14,120
they're going to have a vintage master system to replace the pinball machine from the first game.

946
01:30:14,120 --> 01:30:20,120
And I guess the master system actually, yeah. So, uh, the first menu you see, uh, it's an option

947
01:30:20,120 --> 01:30:25,400
screen where you can like read the manual, change the region of the game. You can pause the game,

948
01:30:25,400 --> 01:30:29,800
um, which I guess on the, and I didn't realize this on the original console, the pause was on

949
01:30:29,800 --> 01:30:34,440
the console, not the controller. Um, but I guess, you know, thinking about old design,

950
01:30:34,440 --> 01:30:41,320
it probably was that way. Uh, and then you see in the video Penguinland or Doki Doki Penguinland,

951
01:30:41,320 --> 01:30:47,560
uh, before, uh, Takuya Kimura, uh, settles in to play Alex Kidd. So I think that's kind of

952
01:30:47,560 --> 01:30:55,400
interesting. So, um, yeah, so, uh, lost judgment, of course, the sequel to 2019 judgment, uh,

953
01:30:55,400 --> 01:31:01,560
and it's due out in September. So, you know, you can buy this new fancy Akusa game and play old

954
01:31:01,560 --> 01:31:07,960
games in it to some extent. So weird that like a company would put their old catalog of games in

955
01:31:07,960 --> 01:31:15,160
there without trying to sell it separately for more money. I mean, if only other larger companies

956
01:31:15,160 --> 01:31:20,520
would take note of that and like, I don't know, offered in their game with animals and

957
01:31:20,520 --> 01:31:27,800
town building, maybe that might be a good idea to do that and not be super greedy and just complete

958
01:31:27,800 --> 01:31:31,880
dicks about it. I don't know. Well, Loki, I think the video game companies to that would say,

959
01:31:35,160 --> 01:31:36,360
everything's about the bottom line.

960
01:31:39,080 --> 01:31:42,920
I know, but what, what made us all check? I mean, at least for me, I guess I can't speak

961
01:31:42,920 --> 01:31:47,000
for everyone, but what made me interested in animal crossing in the first play in the

962
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:50,760
very first place? Why did I give it, give a hoot about animal crossing on the game cube?

963
01:31:50,760 --> 01:31:54,920
It was that little, little sticker right on the front that said comes with two classic NES games

964
01:31:54,920 --> 01:32:00,120
and you can unlock many more that sold that game to me. And it's not necessarily that people are

965
01:32:00,120 --> 01:32:04,600
going to like, I don't know why they're taking it as like, people are going to just not buy

966
01:32:04,600 --> 01:32:11,080
the game now because they have it available in like another game to play. Like that's not the

967
01:32:11,080 --> 01:32:14,840
case. Like, I don't think like, for example, with Yakuza, like a dragon, you know, I'm not

968
01:32:15,480 --> 01:32:20,040
gonna, well, I'm not interested in virtual fighter. But like, if I was, I'm not gonna not

969
01:32:20,040 --> 01:32:25,720
purchase like virtual fighter five. If you know, just because I can play it in a game,

970
01:32:25,720 --> 01:32:30,520
it's inconvenient to do that just kind of a neat thing to be able to do that Sega is still selling

971
01:32:30,520 --> 01:32:37,640
these games separately and collections that are available out there that you can purchase. I just

972
01:32:37,880 --> 01:32:42,600
don't be greedy. Just come on. Like, I don't get it why they're doing this.

973
01:32:42,600 --> 01:32:48,040
And Bobby, of course, and Chad is asking, have you played like a dragon yet? And sadly,

974
01:32:48,040 --> 01:32:51,880
the answer is no. But that's because I'm kind of stretched on bandwidth right now. I can't,

975
01:32:52,520 --> 01:32:58,200
I can't download any new games right now. We're like almost out of bandwidth. So either I just

976
01:32:58,200 --> 01:33:04,440
have to suck it up and pay extra money or I'm going to try again next month. So that's a whole

977
01:33:04,520 --> 01:33:10,440
other issue. Why? Why? We don't have, you know, two terabyte caps yet, but whatever.

978
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:17,000
Anyway, let's move on. Oh, I think this is an appropriate time after that story to get

979
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:23,560
into this segment.

980
01:33:32,520 --> 01:33:38,520
Time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and

981
01:33:38,520 --> 01:33:44,360
tell you about it. It's time for the classic game of the week. What is that classic game of the week?

982
01:33:44,360 --> 01:33:54,280
Lemmings. Yes, I picked lemmings. I haven't done lemmings. I was surprised I haven't done lemmings

983
01:33:54,280 --> 01:33:59,480
and it's been on fucking everything. I was really surprised. I swore we talked about

984
01:33:59,480 --> 01:34:02,920
this game, but I guess we just talked about it. It wasn't highlighted. Yeah,

985
01:34:02,920 --> 01:34:08,520
it's certainly not. And it's a game based off of something completely fabricated too.

986
01:34:09,480 --> 01:34:20,440
So, because there was a study that was fabricated that said that lemmings will

987
01:34:20,440 --> 01:34:27,400
follow each other off a cliff and into death and everything. And it was done in like,

988
01:34:29,240 --> 01:34:33,640
oh gosh, what was it? Yeah, it was that they were driven to mass suicide when they,

989
01:34:33,800 --> 01:34:41,080
uh, when they, uh, you know, go, it was, it was stupid. Anyway, so basically in Lemmings,

990
01:34:41,080 --> 01:34:47,400
it's a puzzle. It's a puzzle game. It was originally developed by DMA design in Dundee,

991
01:34:47,400 --> 01:34:56,040
Scotland and published by Psygnosis for the Amiga in 1991. So we have a 30 year old game.

992
01:34:56,040 --> 01:35:07,720
Um, it was also ported for many, many, many, many, many other platforms. So it was also inspired

993
01:35:07,720 --> 01:35:17,640
by an animation that was done with deluxe paint. So anyway, um, the objective of the game is to

994
01:35:17,640 --> 01:35:22,280
take these anthropomorphized lemmings that look nothing like a lemming by the way, cause lemmings

995
01:35:22,280 --> 01:35:31,000
are fucking adorable, um, do different obstacles to an exit. Um, you have to save a certain amount

996
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:35,720
of the lemmings to win. And if you want to think of like a more modern take on it, think of like

997
01:35:35,720 --> 01:35:44,680
choo choo rocket. Uh, anyway, um, you, uh, assign different lemmings, one of eight different skills

998
01:35:44,680 --> 01:35:51,480
that allow them to react with the landscape. So, um, it also affects the behavior of the

999
01:35:51,480 --> 01:36:00,280
other lemmings that can make, uh, safe passages for them and all kinds of things. Um, it was the

1000
01:36:00,280 --> 01:36:08,120
second highest rated game for Strad. Um, and it was the eighth greatest game of all time by

1001
01:36:08,120 --> 01:36:13,960
next generation magazine as of 1996. And one of, again, one of the most widely ported and best

1002
01:36:13,960 --> 01:36:19,880
selling video games, um, for all of its various ports that sold over 200 million copies. Um,

1003
01:36:19,880 --> 01:36:27,800
there's sequels, remakes, spinoffs, inspired games, all kinds of stuff. Um, and it's, it's been

1004
01:36:27,800 --> 01:36:38,520
up there. Um, so at any rate, um, the original, um, the original game, uh, you had, uh, different

1005
01:36:38,520 --> 01:36:44,840
levels that had four difficulty categories and each level has a trap door opening from above that

1006
01:36:44,840 --> 01:36:50,440
releases a stream of lemmings to follow each other. And so, like I said before, you just have

1007
01:36:50,440 --> 01:36:57,080
to get them from point A to point B lemmings can die by falling from a great height, falling into

1008
01:36:57,080 --> 01:37:03,960
water or lava and disappearing off the bottom of the map, being caught in a trap or fire, um, or

1009
01:37:03,960 --> 01:37:11,320
being assigned to the bomber skill. Um, and, uh, every level of course has a time limit. If it's

1010
01:37:11,320 --> 01:37:20,360
down to zero, then it ends. So, uh, your levels of difficulty are, um, fun, tricky, taxing,

1011
01:37:20,360 --> 01:37:27,880
and mayhem. So I think that's pretty funny. There's also a, uh, two player mode, 22 player levels,

1012
01:37:28,680 --> 01:37:35,640
um, that actually took advantage of the Amiga's ability to support two simultaneous mice.

1013
01:37:36,440 --> 01:37:41,560
And then of course with the, uh, later on with the Atari's ability to, uh, play with a mouse

1014
01:37:41,560 --> 01:37:48,520
and joystick simultaneously. So, uh, you can, you know, do your own lemmings, you have their own

1015
01:37:48,520 --> 01:37:55,720
base, um, and you have to get more of more lemmings regardless of color into one's own base

1016
01:37:55,720 --> 01:38:03,000
than the other player. So you can actually lemming snipe. So, um, as for the development of the game,

1017
01:38:03,400 --> 01:38:13,880
it was, uh, uh, meant to just be a, just a fun little thing, but it was inspired by that one

1018
01:38:13,880 --> 01:38:20,040
little, uh, eight by eight pixel box. It was you using deluxe paint and it's just of a little

1019
01:38:20,760 --> 01:38:30,520
dude with blue hair walking. Um, and so, uh, it was actually as part of a development for

1020
01:38:31,160 --> 01:38:34,600
a game called Walker, which was supposed to be a sequel to a game called blood money.

1021
01:38:35,240 --> 01:38:45,320
Um, but as they went through, you know, they, uh, ended up just going with games with, with

1022
01:38:45,320 --> 01:38:50,680
their game and they kept going and there we go. We have a lemmings. I'm not going to go like way

1023
01:38:50,680 --> 01:38:56,920
into the history. If you want to know more about it, there's a, uh, a documentary, um, called the

1024
01:38:56,920 --> 01:39:05,400
lemming story and from 2006, you can all watch. Um, so going, going back then, so going into the

1025
01:39:05,400 --> 01:39:14,920
various, various assistance, um, there were released for Atari ST Sinclair spectrum, uh,

1026
01:39:14,920 --> 01:39:26,360
the ZX spectrum PC SNES. Um, after the game was ported to 20 systems, um, David Jones, who was,

1027
01:39:26,360 --> 01:39:33,960
uh, in part behind this, uh, basically steady, stop counting. Um, for other ones, other commercial

1028
01:39:33,960 --> 01:39:39,480
ports, we've had the 3dio, the acorn, the Archimedes, the, uh, apple two GS, uh, the

1029
01:39:39,480 --> 01:39:45,880
Macintosh and as in the old Macintosh, the CDTV, Commodore 64 NES master system, Genesis,

1030
01:39:45,880 --> 01:39:52,760
turbo graphics, 16 Phillips CDI and sharp X 68,000. Um, and then there was an open source cross

1031
01:39:52,760 --> 01:40:01,560
platform clone in 1998 called pingas P I N G U S. Um, psychosis has continuously owned

1032
01:40:01,560 --> 01:40:06,200
the license for lemming. And then of course now Sony owns it, but, um,

1033
01:40:08,920 --> 01:40:14,600
uh, but when of course, uh, signosis closed that made it fully owned by Sony. And so they've done

1034
01:40:14,600 --> 01:40:21,160
more modern remakes. We have lemmings for PSP done by team 17 has the original levels and a

1035
01:40:21,160 --> 01:40:30,520
bunch of others and data pack support. Um, there were, uh, you can make your own user levels

1036
01:40:30,520 --> 01:40:38,920
through a lemmings online community. There was, uh, uh, another one, uh, for PS2 that used the

1037
01:40:38,920 --> 01:40:46,280
eye toy. Um, how did they would mention the eye toy again? Huh? Uh, team 17 also did one for PS3

1038
01:40:46,280 --> 01:40:52,680
through the PlayStation network. Um, very similar to the PSP title. Um, but of course it doesn't

1039
01:40:52,680 --> 01:41:00,520
have the ability to, uh, create and share levels. And then there's lemmings touch for PS Vita. Um,

1040
01:41:01,080 --> 01:41:11,720
that was done, uh, by, uh, it says by, uh, D3 T limited and then a sad puppy from Sony did a mobile

1041
01:41:11,720 --> 01:41:17,960
friendly version of lemmings for iOS and Android in 20 teen. There were a bunch of expansions for

1042
01:41:17,960 --> 01:41:24,680
the original called. Oh no, more lemmings was one of them. It was Christmas lemmings. Um, of course

1043
01:41:24,680 --> 01:41:36,280
the Christmas lemmings. Yeah. Yeah. Um, there, uh, in fact, uh, where I'm reading everything from

1044
01:41:36,280 --> 01:41:42,040
has a picture of the floppy, the three, the three and a half or three and a quarter. Sorry. Um,

1045
01:41:43,240 --> 01:41:54,840
there, uh, I mean, they're just basically so many, many, many, many. So we'll, we'll go into some of

1046
01:41:54,840 --> 01:42:02,200
the, the post original. So lemmings to the tribes, uh, all new world, all new world of lemmings,

1047
01:42:02,200 --> 01:42:09,880
um, 3d lemmings lemmings revolution. Um, there was also lemmings paintball in 1996 and the

1048
01:42:09,880 --> 01:42:17,960
adventures of Lomax. There were the clones, like the humans, um, pingas was when I mentioned

1049
01:42:17,960 --> 01:42:26,040
earlier, there is a game called, uh, mouse craft that borrows from lemmings and Tetris.

1050
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:39,960
Um, and then, uh, there we go. So we've also had, uh, I mean, just lots of people reference it. I

1051
01:42:39,960 --> 01:42:48,920
mean, in, uh, uh, the first Warcraft game, they, uh, were inspired in part by the lemmings versus

1052
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:56,200
mode, um, including also with, uh, the lost Vikings. Um, and then, uh, Terry Pratchett,

1053
01:42:56,200 --> 01:43:03,000
you know, um, one of the great authors, um, in his novel, interesting times, uh,

1054
01:43:03,000 --> 01:43:09,960
he had an army of golems that was used the way that the lemmings were used the same interface.

1055
01:43:10,920 --> 01:43:18,840
Um, and then he said, uh, merely because the red army can fight, dig, March and climb,

1056
01:43:18,840 --> 01:43:23,320
and is controlled by little icons. Can't imagine how anyone thought that not only did I wipe

1057
01:43:23,320 --> 01:43:30,440
lemmings from my hard disk, I override it. So I couldn't get it back. And there you go. Oh, also

1058
01:43:30,440 --> 01:43:38,040
the Royal mail had, uh, lemmings, uh, stamps in 2020 to pay tribute to the UK's, uh, video

1059
01:43:38,040 --> 01:43:44,120
game industry. And on that note lemmings. All right. There it is a true classic, uh,

1060
01:43:44,120 --> 01:43:50,680
one notable on stamps overseas, uh, lemmings. I, you know, I gotta admit, like I, I knew this

1061
01:43:50,680 --> 01:43:56,280
series, um, you know, it kind of faded away. I didn't realize how recent they were still making

1062
01:43:56,280 --> 01:44:00,200
these games. When you brought up like the Vita, I was like, I don't remember that having a Vita

1063
01:44:00,200 --> 01:44:05,560
game, but, um, I do remember this game was absolutely huge when it first came out. I

1064
01:44:05,640 --> 01:44:10,200
remember playing it. I remember downloading that Christmas lemmings. Uh, I think there was a,

1065
01:44:10,200 --> 01:44:14,520
a multi-stage demo or something that was on a BBS. And I remember, cause I don't think it

1066
01:44:14,520 --> 01:44:18,600
was the whole game, but I remember downloading like a Christmas lemmings thing from a gamer,

1067
01:44:18,600 --> 01:44:23,080
like I think had it, uh, maybe, I don't know, but like, you know, something like that. Yeah.

1068
01:44:23,080 --> 01:44:30,200
This game was, it was called holiday lemmings. Oh, maybe. Oh yeah. Well that would make sense too.

1069
01:44:30,200 --> 01:44:33,960
But, um, yeah. So it's just, it's just one of those things. It's like, yeah, it was a really

1070
01:44:33,960 --> 01:44:38,600
Epic part of like nineties gaming history, especially on a computer, even though they

1071
01:44:38,600 --> 01:44:43,320
put it out on every console out there as you kind of got into, uh, I kind of always considered it

1072
01:44:43,320 --> 01:44:47,160
a PC game. I think it was a super Nintendo game because it supported this. I think it was one of

1073
01:44:47,160 --> 01:44:51,880
the few games that supported that SNES mouse. Like you didn't need it, but I think it supported it

1074
01:44:51,880 --> 01:44:57,400
and it was certainly much better for having it. So, um, yeah. Orange right in chats has probably

1075
01:44:57,400 --> 01:45:01,480
played this on one of those shareware filled CDs back in the day. I'm positive that's where

1076
01:45:01,480 --> 01:45:06,040
Christmas lemmings was hiding out, man. But, um, yeah, what a throwback, what a, what a great,

1077
01:45:06,040 --> 01:45:11,560
great, um, game from history. Have any of y'all ever seen what an actual lemming looks like?

1078
01:45:12,280 --> 01:45:15,480
Oh, it's not, they're not blue with green hair. That's for sure. They're

1079
01:45:15,480 --> 01:45:23,640
no, they're these adorable, cute little tiny rodents. They're so freaking cute.

1080
01:45:24,360 --> 01:45:29,720
Like I can't get over it. So I have a very fun and embarrassing story that taught that

1081
01:45:30,360 --> 01:45:38,760
directly ties into what this game can't wait. Do it. So back in the early nineties,

1082
01:45:38,760 --> 01:45:45,080
for some reason, I was, uh, I had actually a fan site for lemmings and actually,

1083
01:45:45,880 --> 01:45:49,640
so I, well, it wasn't necessarily for the game. So like, here's the, here's,

1084
01:45:49,640 --> 01:45:55,800
here's the thing. Like I found that I could draw them kind of pretty easy. You know,

1085
01:45:55,800 --> 01:45:59,960
it's a pretty difficult, it's not difficult. So I was drawing a bunch of them. And so I

1086
01:45:59,960 --> 01:46:05,800
actually had a fan site with like my, uh, artwork that I put out there that was on like

1087
01:46:05,800 --> 01:46:11,000
geo cities or something like way back in the day. But yeah, the lemmings continent was,

1088
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:15,880
I think you can probably still find it actually on the way back machine and stuff like that.

1089
01:46:15,880 --> 01:46:22,280
But yeah, that was a long time ago. I did that and actually embarrassingly enough. Um,

1090
01:46:22,280 --> 01:46:29,080
there was an, like a film festival or something like that, that Sega had went through. And I

1091
01:46:29,080 --> 01:46:34,680
remember talking to them or like somebody that worked for Sega about like pitching a game idea

1092
01:46:34,680 --> 01:46:39,960
or something like a sequel to all that stuff, even though they have no rights to it at all.

1093
01:46:39,960 --> 01:46:42,200
And I don't know why I thought that would work out, but like,

1094
01:46:43,960 --> 01:46:48,120
I don't know, I was obsessed for awhile, but I have artwork that at the time I thought was

1095
01:46:48,120 --> 01:46:53,240
pretty good. It's all right. I still have it saved, you know, um, uh, printed out. I don't

1096
01:46:53,240 --> 01:46:58,840
know if I have the files anymore, but, um, yeah, that was kind of like my early high school was

1097
01:46:58,840 --> 01:47:04,600
that kind of stuff. I love that. I had a websites in college dedicated to female musicians. There

1098
01:47:04,600 --> 01:47:10,520
was like four different ones and one of them was on MTV and yeah, let's try and find it. I know

1099
01:47:10,520 --> 01:47:16,680
that I think it's out there actually, because it was called the lemmings continent. So that's what

1100
01:47:16,680 --> 01:47:21,720
it was called. It was not a web, it wasn't like a.com or anything like that. It was, uh, I don't

1101
01:47:21,720 --> 01:47:26,520
remember what the URL was, but that that's what it was called, but you can probably find it on

1102
01:47:26,520 --> 01:47:32,760
the way back machine. Um, I don't remember if it was like a Yahoo site or something like that,

1103
01:47:32,760 --> 01:47:37,160
but I know I found it at one time cause I got copies of the artwork. I think it's still out

1104
01:47:37,160 --> 01:47:44,920
there, but yeah, I had my own embarrassing websites too. So I had one about Julia Chang

1105
01:47:44,920 --> 01:47:51,800
and Tekken three. Oh, that's true. And I had one and I had one, uh, this was that, well,

1106
01:47:51,800 --> 01:47:59,880
that one was geo cities and then I had one through AOL. That was, um, my absolute shipping of, uh,

1107
01:47:59,880 --> 01:48:06,440
Ryoga and Ukyo from Ronwell. I love that. I mean, it's, yeah, the, the, the old websites

1108
01:48:06,440 --> 01:48:10,760
are embarrassing, but at the same time for me, it's like, well, you know, those, uh,

1109
01:48:10,760 --> 01:48:14,600
those musicians really impacted me during a very difficult time in my life. So I'm,

1110
01:48:14,600 --> 01:48:19,160
I'm not actually embarrassed by it, but it is just a little silly. You know, it's, it's silly.

1111
01:48:19,160 --> 01:48:24,280
I think it's a good way for me, for me. Um, yeah. Dark soccer and chat says geo shitties.

1112
01:48:25,160 --> 01:48:32,040
I think I, so I do. Okay. So I did find a link that someone had posted like in an old tripod

1113
01:48:32,040 --> 01:48:38,200
site because they had linked to it. Um, but I, so I have the old URL, so you have to go in the way

1114
01:48:38,200 --> 01:48:43,240
back machine, but I'll post it in chat. All right. I love that. Our old Rocky horror site,

1115
01:48:43,240 --> 01:48:48,280
uh, was on a geo cities, our old cast website. It's great. Yeah. It was an old geo city site,

1116
01:48:48,280 --> 01:48:52,520
but that, yeah, there it is. And then, um, I think on the way back machine, you can see some

1117
01:48:52,520 --> 01:48:57,960
of the artwork, which now is all right. I thought I did. All right. I was excited about it. All

1118
01:48:57,960 --> 01:49:05,720
right. Let's move on. It's very matrixy, which is really, it doesn't really early nineties. What

1119
01:49:06,440 --> 01:49:13,480
you, all right. Actually it wasn't the movie 99. So there'll be late nineties. Oh, it was,

1120
01:49:13,480 --> 01:49:16,280
I think, I don't remember, but yeah, it was, it's very much like that.

1121
01:49:17,560 --> 01:49:21,560
I'm most positive. The matrix came out in 99. Cause I saw it with friends in college.

1122
01:49:21,560 --> 01:49:28,200
I wasn't in high school. I don't remember. I have to find out now. 1999. Yep. That's what

1123
01:49:28,200 --> 01:49:32,040
I thought. Yeah. The original matrix was 1999. Maybe you were just ahead of your time.

1124
01:49:32,040 --> 01:49:37,880
Logie. I think I saw it right before, you know, right after I moved out here.

1125
01:49:40,280 --> 01:49:44,600
All right. Anyhow, let's move up. Orange. Right. It says, yep. It's on the way back machine and

1126
01:49:44,600 --> 01:49:48,600
here's the receipts. Oh, I can't wait to look at this. Oh yes. And then I got my,

1127
01:49:48,600 --> 01:49:56,120
yeah, there's my artwork. It's here. This background. Well, Hey, that, that was,

1128
01:49:56,120 --> 01:50:03,480
that was the, the, uh, yeah. Uh, orange. Right. And Chad says it even has a section for encounters

1129
01:50:03,480 --> 01:50:09,560
with stupid people. The original FUs of the week. Yes. I remember that now. Oh gosh. Yeah. People

1130
01:50:09,560 --> 01:50:15,080
found my old personal websites and no, I'm not even giving you an EMS, but found my personal

1131
01:50:15,080 --> 01:50:20,120
website. So like my angsty poetry and shit, I'd probably die, but is when I had data files,

1132
01:50:20,120 --> 01:50:25,320
like this is where I actually had a edit data and stuff like that. And, or I did at one point.

1133
01:50:25,320 --> 01:50:31,640
Oh, they're cute. Yeah. So that was, that was, that was fun times when that was my kind of

1134
01:50:31,640 --> 01:50:37,480
getting used to working. I think I was back with corral draw, like, or yeah, it's corral draw.

1135
01:50:37,480 --> 01:50:41,000
It was what we had in our art class. So that was kind of just stuff I was just messing around with

1136
01:50:41,000 --> 01:50:45,560
and everything. But yeah, I had a character named suicide, Bob, which is completely inappropriate.

1137
01:50:45,560 --> 01:50:50,600
He has Pikachu's face on it. Uh, but he was a stick of dynamite that would keep resurrecting

1138
01:50:50,600 --> 01:50:55,960
himself kind of like, uh, predating, um, Kenny from South park, but that was, that was that

1139
01:50:55,960 --> 01:51:01,240
character. But yeah, it was fun times. Glad you got the, got the witness of my artwork.

1140
01:51:02,280 --> 01:51:05,400
And now we're going to be digging through this website. All right. All night. All right. We've

1141
01:51:05,400 --> 01:51:11,400
always reading your first stupid person story. Oh gosh. I don't even know. There's so many.

1142
01:51:12,040 --> 01:51:16,520
We need to break things up and, uh, travel ag, you bring up DDR on here though. So this was

1143
01:51:16,520 --> 01:51:20,520
still going when you first like this. Oh, wow. I made this when I was 20. I thought it was so

1144
01:51:20,520 --> 01:51:25,880
much younger. You probably ended this right before OLR started. So that's kind of a fun relic. All

1145
01:51:25,880 --> 01:51:30,040
right. Uh, anyway, let's move on. We got to keep moving with the show, get some rapid fire news.

1146
01:51:30,040 --> 01:51:35,560
So Loki, if you want to change the topic, here's your chance. Yeah. So let's talk about space jam.

1147
01:51:36,120 --> 01:51:43,720
Uh, so the space jam is getting a video game, or at least a SQL is. So they actually had a contest,

1148
01:51:44,360 --> 01:51:48,920
that kind of posed the question of what do you think a space jam video game would look like? So

1149
01:51:48,920 --> 01:51:53,480
they'd had fans submitting artwork and stuff. And so they based on that, the developers at

1150
01:51:53,480 --> 01:51:59,640
digital clips decided to go ahead and create a game that kind of looks like an old arcade beat

1151
01:51:59,640 --> 01:52:07,800
them up. So they have that. And that'll be coming out pretty soon on a game pass ultimate and all

1152
01:52:07,800 --> 01:52:13,160
the other platforms looks like July 1st. So space jam, a new legacy for that. And then tie in with

1153
01:52:13,160 --> 01:52:19,000
the Xbox portion of that they're actually going to be doing a goon squad tune squad and some other

1154
01:52:19,640 --> 01:52:25,400
random I don't know what it's supposed to be controllers that you can actually purchase,

1155
01:52:25,400 --> 01:52:31,080
I think through the Microsoft store and Amazon for a limited time starting July 8th. But yeah,

1156
01:52:31,080 --> 01:52:36,440
and then it's going to be free to play or alt it's coming to game pass ultimate July 1st free

1157
01:52:36,440 --> 01:52:44,920
to play for everyone else July 15. So check that out. Another cool piece of tie in stuff is this

1158
01:52:44,920 --> 01:52:51,560
brand new Sonic the Hedgehog DLC for Minecraft, Minecraft bedrock that is. So it's actually it's

1159
01:52:51,560 --> 01:52:57,560
not just like skinning Minecraft to, you know, kind of Sonic kind of how they had with the

1160
01:52:57,560 --> 01:53:03,160
Super Mario stuff. But it actually changes the gameplay quite a bit like you're actually playing

1161
01:53:03,160 --> 01:53:07,240
it kind of like Sonic the Hedgehog. So that's pretty awesome. And they've got like the Green

1162
01:53:07,240 --> 01:53:14,520
Hill zone, chemical plants zone, lots of other hidden things you can find in there. So worth

1163
01:53:14,520 --> 01:53:22,200
checking out if you have Minecraft. It looks pretty, pretty expansive. You know, before we

1164
01:53:22,200 --> 01:53:28,040
get to dark soccer stories now my brain is going to see having seen Loki's old website. I think a

1165
01:53:28,040 --> 01:53:32,280
fun bonus. I'm not saying I'm not committing to this idea. But I'm just saying maybe I might be

1166
01:53:32,760 --> 01:53:38,600
down for this. A fun bonus stream might be dramatic readings of our old live journal posts.

1167
01:53:42,120 --> 01:53:45,160
You don't a lot of mine were private for a reason, Rob.

1168
01:53:46,360 --> 01:53:50,680
I'm not saying everybody has to participate. I'm just saying it's an it's an idea.

1169
01:53:52,360 --> 01:53:56,280
All right, maybe so you could you could use one of your old websites. You don't necessarily have

1170
01:53:56,280 --> 01:54:00,600
to use LiveJournal. You know, I don't I don't even remember what I called those websites.

1171
01:54:00,600 --> 01:54:03,480
Yeah. All right. All right. How about some rapid fire news?

1172
01:54:04,360 --> 01:54:14,200
All right. Well, speaking of Sonic, Netflix is working on a new Sonic show

1173
01:54:15,000 --> 01:54:23,400
that's called Sonic Prime. And the thing is that there's a leak about it of some of the concept

1174
01:54:23,400 --> 01:54:29,880
artwork that came from Patrick Horan's ArtStation profile. He's a visual development and environment

1175
01:54:29,880 --> 01:54:37,080
artist. He's worked on Rev and Roll and the Last Inspector Gadget series. And he worked freelance

1176
01:54:37,080 --> 01:54:46,520
for studio Wild Brain that worked with Sega and Netflix for that series. And so we have an Eggman.

1177
01:54:47,160 --> 01:54:56,280
We have Sonic hiding. We have him apparently doing the Fortnite dance. And we have a prehistoric Amy

1178
01:54:56,280 --> 01:55:06,920
Rose. And portals. Hmm. So. We'll see. All right. Looks I mean, it looks interesting.

1179
01:55:08,040 --> 01:55:11,880
If this is the style they go with for the art, I really, really do think it's great.

1180
01:55:14,280 --> 01:55:22,920
Neat. And then in other news, one of my favorite ever series is getting a version for PS4 Switch,

1181
01:55:22,920 --> 01:55:29,560
PC and arcade. Yay. And it is Superlative Night Dreams, Cotton Rock and Roll.

1182
01:55:30,600 --> 01:55:36,840
And for anyone who doesn't know what Cotton is, it starts as this cute little witch and her name

1183
01:55:36,840 --> 01:55:48,120
is Nata de Cotton. And she's addicted to this bad tasting candy called Willow. And so she enlists

1184
01:55:48,120 --> 01:55:51,880
the aid of fairies and by enlist, I mean, she basically traps them and make them work for her.

1185
01:55:53,000 --> 01:56:00,600
To go retrieve all the willow. That's only part of it. But anyway, success is the company behind

1186
01:56:00,600 --> 01:56:05,960
it. And like I said, it's going to be out for PS4, Switch, PC and arcade. The PS4 and Switch

1187
01:56:05,960 --> 01:56:16,600
versions will be out December 23rd in Japan for 6380 yen. PC version winter between 2021 and 2022

1188
01:56:16,600 --> 01:56:25,480
and arcade version between summer fall 2021. There's also going to be a 30th anniversary

1189
01:56:25,480 --> 01:56:34,600
special edition that will be 10,780 yen. So about a hundred and five hundred and six bucks

1190
01:56:35,400 --> 01:56:42,120
that has a Nata de Cotton nendroid, the Cotton Complete Works book and the Cotton Rock and Roll

1191
01:56:42,200 --> 01:56:50,200
original CD. So I am super happy about that. And pre-orders are already available in Japan at

1192
01:56:50,200 --> 01:56:57,320
7net and Yobodashi. So if you're going to import it, there you go. Also confirmed is a cotton,

1193
01:56:57,320 --> 01:57:03,320
silk and applique pumpkin. Yes, their names are all based on clothing and tailoring.

1194
01:57:06,200 --> 01:57:10,840
One other piece of rapid fire news I want to insert in here before we get to world release

1195
01:57:10,840 --> 01:57:15,960
dates. I want to remind everybody that the Summer Games Done Quick Marathon is coming up this week.

1196
01:57:15,960 --> 01:57:19,960
It actually starts on July 4th, which ironically, I should also mention to the listeners,

1197
01:57:20,520 --> 01:57:24,200
we will not be here next week. We're not going to have a live show next week because the holiday

1198
01:57:24,200 --> 01:57:28,200
here in the States, we couldn't really get our schedules to match up. And that's OK. It's a

1199
01:57:28,200 --> 01:57:31,880
holiday anyway. So I imagine a lot of you guys will be out doing things, especially, you know,

1200
01:57:31,880 --> 01:57:36,440
now that more and more places and things are opening, you're probably or at least doing maybe

1201
01:57:36,440 --> 01:57:40,840
a small gathering or something like that. I don't know. But yeah, so we're not gonna be here live.

1202
01:57:40,840 --> 01:57:48,680
But of course, the Summer Games Done Quick Marathon starts on the 4th and runs through the

1203
01:57:50,040 --> 01:57:55,000
10th or 11th. I can't remember the date off my head, but I do know our very own Bobby Blackwolf

1204
01:57:55,000 --> 01:58:01,640
is going to be participating as one of the announcers as he has been for a few of those now,

1205
01:58:01,640 --> 01:58:07,720
at least a year, all the virtual ones. So I know he's doing the overnights, I think on the 5th.

1206
01:58:08,440 --> 01:58:11,560
And then I think a lot of you guys are going to hear him when he does the big finale,

1207
01:58:11,560 --> 01:58:15,320
Kingdom Hearts 2. He's going to be announcing during that. Of course, it is about the speed

1208
01:58:15,320 --> 01:58:20,920
runners and their commentators that they have on the virtual couch. So, you know, Bobby's there to

1209
01:58:20,920 --> 01:58:25,480
get the donators read and all that stuff. So the real stars of the show are the speed runners,

1210
01:58:25,480 --> 01:58:30,600
the charities. But it's pretty cool to kind of know somebody that's very involved with that.

1211
01:58:30,600 --> 01:58:37,640
Absolutely. Bobby also with a big tip here. If you use hashtag VOG Network at the end of your

1212
01:58:37,640 --> 01:58:43,640
donation during his shift, you have a higher chance. I want to underline bold, italicize,

1213
01:58:43,640 --> 01:58:49,480
chance of getting it read or excuse me, of getting it to Bobby to potentially get read.

1214
01:58:49,480 --> 01:58:54,600
But do not mention VOG, OLR, Bobby's podcast or anything that could be seen as self-promotion,

1215
01:58:54,680 --> 01:59:02,040
because again, it's about the charity and about the speed runners. I even know because I donated

1216
01:59:02,040 --> 01:59:07,480
two cycles ago and I think I made a joke about oh, I put the donator as Mr. Smoosh.

1217
01:59:07,480 --> 01:59:14,280
I said that was the donator and it didn't get read. So there was that. I guess somebody thought,

1218
01:59:14,280 --> 01:59:17,880
you know, it could be an entendre for something. I don't know, because I guess smoosh could mean

1219
01:59:17,880 --> 01:59:23,480
sex or something. I don't know. Anything can mean sex. Right. And then but last time I used

1220
01:59:23,480 --> 01:59:28,440
the hashtag and I just put a very generic like, you know, go, you know, actually, no,

1221
01:59:28,440 --> 01:59:31,640
it wasn't generic because I think I actually referenced something that was going on in the

1222
01:59:31,640 --> 01:59:35,720
speed run. I think I did it during the acoustic speed run and just tried to keep a positive and

1223
01:59:35,720 --> 01:59:40,280
it made it to Bobby and got read. So that was cool. The football baby. Yeah. Yeah. The rugby

1224
01:59:40,280 --> 01:59:44,680
baby rugby baby. Yeah. That whole thing. That was hilarious, by the way. Yeah. Bobby says don't use

1225
01:59:44,680 --> 01:59:49,160
anything that might be an inside joke. That was the mistake I made. Although I don't think Mr.

1226
01:59:49,160 --> 01:59:55,480
Smoosh is a joke. Mr. Smoosh is a real person. But I get it. I get it. Why that wasn't picked.

1227
01:59:55,480 --> 01:59:59,800
And also there was no no hashtag thing back then. So I probably didn't even make it to Bobby's desk.

1228
01:59:59,800 --> 02:00:03,320
So anyway, there you go. A little tip for you guys if you're going to be donating. But again,

1229
02:00:03,320 --> 02:00:08,280
I was stressed. Bobby is under no obligation to read them and they are under no obligation to send

1230
02:00:08,280 --> 02:00:11,400
them to him. If you're going to donate money, you're doing it because you appreciate the

1231
02:00:11,400 --> 02:00:15,160
charity. I think that's that's what it's really all about. So I just want to underline bold

1232
02:00:15,160 --> 02:00:22,840
italicize that disclaimer. OK, so there we go. No show next week. Summer games done quick.

1233
02:00:23,960 --> 02:00:26,920
Try to think of any other housekeeping I forgot at the top of the show. I don't think so.

1234
02:00:26,920 --> 02:00:30,760
So let's move on to world release dates. We'll start in the US. Loki.

1235
02:00:31,560 --> 02:00:38,360
So we've got Destroy All Humans coming out for Nintendo Switch. Disgaea 6, Defiance of Destiny,

1236
02:00:38,360 --> 02:00:45,000
also for Nintendo Switch. Ghoul Patrol on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

1237
02:00:45,000 --> 02:00:50,200
Also with that, Zombies Ate My Neighbors on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

1238
02:00:50,760 --> 02:00:59,160
We've got Sky Children of the Light on Nintendo Switch. Wonder Boy, Asha in Monster World on PC.

1239
02:00:59,800 --> 02:01:05,480
And last but not least, Doki Doki Literature Club Plus on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4,

1240
02:01:05,480 --> 02:01:12,040
PlayStation 5, Xbox One and Xbox Series X. I cannot believe we're in the year 2021 and we

1241
02:01:12,040 --> 02:01:16,920
just had Zombies Ate My Neighbors red as a new release this week. That's so exciting.

1242
02:01:16,920 --> 02:01:21,560
All right. Going to Japan on the Nintendo Switch, we have Summer Pockets, Reflection

1243
02:01:21,560 --> 02:01:29,160
Blue is out this week, as well as Moshi Kashite Obaki no Shattika for Nintendo Switch

1244
02:01:29,800 --> 02:01:33,240
is also coming out this week. Those, of course, are Nintendo Switch releases.

1245
02:01:33,800 --> 02:01:39,080
On the PlayStation 5, I don't think we have anything coming out besides maybe a peripheral,

1246
02:01:39,080 --> 02:01:44,280
an official wireless charger, if you want that. Cool. Otherwise, on the PlayStation 4,

1247
02:01:45,160 --> 02:01:50,040
also nothing. It's a pretty slow week in Japan this week. Those Nintendo Switch releases are

1248
02:01:50,040 --> 02:01:54,760
all you get. How about the UK Dark Soccer? Okay. I'm going to have to, because the way

1249
02:01:54,760 --> 02:01:58,280
the site is done, I'm going to have to just break it up and read it a little bit differently. But

1250
02:01:59,560 --> 02:02:04,600
on the 29th, we have Destroy All Humans for Switch. We get Curbed Space,

1251
02:02:05,320 --> 02:02:12,920
uh, Evil Inside on the 30th, Greed Fall Gold Edition, ATV Drift and Tricks, and Distrust,

1252
02:02:12,920 --> 02:02:19,000
looks like a big old box set of it. And then on the first, which is Winds a Day, actually nothing

1253
02:02:19,000 --> 02:02:25,480
on the first. On the second, we have Red Wings Aces of the Sky, Mask Maker for PlayStation,

1254
02:02:25,480 --> 02:02:31,400
Evergate. We have Nightmare Boy, Do Not Feed the Monkeys, Beholder Complete Edition,

1255
02:02:31,400 --> 02:02:38,840
Collector's Edition. Goodness. And then that's it for this week. I could also point out the

1256
02:02:38,840 --> 02:02:43,400
week after. Sure. Oh yeah. We weren't going to be here next week anyway, so sure. Yes. So we have

1257
02:02:43,400 --> 02:02:48,840
In Nightmare, Dark Alliance, Oddworld Soulstorm, those are all on the sixth. On the eighth,

1258
02:02:48,840 --> 02:02:53,240
we have Farmers vs Zombies. We have Monster Hunter Stories 2, Wings of Ruin on the ninth,

1259
02:02:53,240 --> 02:02:57,160
Dungeons of Nihilebek, I guess, the Amulet of Chaos,

1260
02:02:59,800 --> 02:03:04,600
Vampire the Masquerade, the Coteries of New York, and Shadows of New York.

1261
02:03:05,720 --> 02:03:09,240
I, uh, and then some Harvest Moon and some other stuff.

1262
02:03:10,520 --> 02:03:15,800
All right. All right. Let's get through some more stories and then we'll get to your comments from

1263
02:03:15,800 --> 02:03:19,960
the listeners in our, uh, some of the stories you've placed in our Discord throughout the week,

1264
02:03:20,200 --> 02:03:23,400
as well as our mailbag. Participate at orangeonshooter.com and of course,

1265
02:03:23,400 --> 02:03:28,200
live comments from chats. Uh, but for now, let's get to a few more stories starting with Loki.

1266
02:03:29,400 --> 02:03:35,800
Yeah. So there was this lawsuit and this sounds awfully familiar to me, but, uh, Booker T,

1267
02:03:36,680 --> 02:03:38,840
who, uh, his... The wrestler?

1268
02:03:38,840 --> 02:03:45,560
Yes, the wrestler. So Booker T Huffman, who had a wrestler or a character that he did

1269
02:03:45,560 --> 02:03:51,400
back in his early wrestling days called GI Bro. Uh, apparently he was saying that that character

1270
02:03:51,400 --> 02:04:00,680
was kind of stolen by Activision to use in Call of Duty Black Ops 4. So they have a character named

1271
02:04:00,680 --> 02:04:09,160
Prophet, which kind of looks similar. Um, so unfortunately though, the, uh, jury didn't see

1272
02:04:09,160 --> 02:04:16,120
it that way. They figured that it isn't an exact license or likeness, but I re they remember,

1273
02:04:16,120 --> 02:04:22,840
like, not even that long ago, we talked about another issue where the characters like this

1274
02:04:22,840 --> 02:04:27,560
was taken for Call of Duty game as well. And they had actually shot somebody, you know,

1275
02:04:28,600 --> 02:04:35,720
with similar, basically the same actress with the same get, you know, outfit and everything

1276
02:04:35,720 --> 02:04:40,120
also for Call of Duty likeness. So it's like kind of seeing a trend here a little bit,

1277
02:04:40,120 --> 02:04:44,040
the kind of just skirt and, you know, let's make it look just like the character,

1278
02:04:44,040 --> 02:04:49,080
but just enough so we don't get sued. Dude, the faces though, uncannily

1279
02:04:51,640 --> 02:04:57,640
similar. Yeah, it is. And, but once again, I think it's just one of those, like, we're

1280
02:04:57,640 --> 02:05:01,080
going to use the likeness without, you know, just making it different enough.

1281
02:05:01,080 --> 02:05:06,680
Plaintiff does not own the idea of an angry man with a scowling look. I'm sorry. That made me

1282
02:05:06,680 --> 02:05:14,600
laugh. Yeah. So they probably just didn't have a strong enough case, but it does seem to be like

1283
02:05:14,600 --> 02:05:19,400
a trend that, you know, the stuff that they're getting away with. I, I feel that they're getting

1284
02:05:19,400 --> 02:05:26,840
away with, but we'll see. I don't know. I'm sure this is not the last of these types of

1285
02:05:26,840 --> 02:05:31,960
cases we're going to hear in a courtroom. So, I mean, go back to the top of the show.

1286
02:05:31,960 --> 02:05:37,000
We're talking about, you know, completely, uh, going to the extent of lifting somebody's voice.

1287
02:05:37,000 --> 02:05:43,560
I mean, you know, anyway. All right. Um, well, moving on, let's talk about, um, this is pretty

1288
02:05:43,560 --> 02:05:48,040
big news for the Blizzard crowd this week. If you're a fan of Blizzard games, um, you probably

1289
02:05:48,040 --> 02:05:53,880
are very excited to hear that Overwatch is now cross-play. I mean, a great idea to pump some

1290
02:05:53,880 --> 02:05:57,880
life into a game that's, uh, I don't want to say is dying, but a game that's probably showing its

1291
02:05:57,880 --> 02:06:02,040
age. It's been around for a few years. Hasn't really had any big updates in a while because

1292
02:06:02,040 --> 02:06:06,120
obviously they're working on Overwatch 2. That is the big update that's going to be coming later.

1293
02:06:06,120 --> 02:06:11,480
Um, but this is a pretty big deal to, uh, get more people excited about Overwatch and revisiting

1294
02:06:11,480 --> 02:06:15,960
and shorten the time to find a match. I'm sure because Overwatch is now cross-play

1295
02:06:15,960 --> 02:06:21,000
between PC, PlayStation, Xbox, and Switch, which means for the first time,

1296
02:06:21,720 --> 02:06:26,760
console players can see chat. And I bet a lot of them are very sad about that and wish they could

1297
02:06:26,760 --> 02:06:31,080
turn this feature off. I think actually you probably can. Uh, because if you want it,

1298
02:06:31,080 --> 02:06:35,800
yeah, if you want to enable cross-play, you do have to make a battle net account, which, um,

1299
02:06:35,800 --> 02:06:40,120
I'm sure many people already have. If you are a PC gamer at all, and you've ever played something

1300
02:06:40,120 --> 02:06:44,920
like Diablo, World of Warcraft, Starcraft. Your console gamer that had the play doom,

1301
02:06:44,920 --> 02:06:48,920
you know, I think you had to do that as well. You're thinking of a Bethesda account, but

1302
02:06:49,480 --> 02:06:56,120
sorry. Yeah. Similar, similar train of thought, but yes, different. Um, so do you have to have

1303
02:06:56,120 --> 02:06:59,320
a battle net account for call of duty? So there's probably a lot of people have that.

1304
02:06:59,320 --> 02:07:05,800
Um, I don't know about consoles. Um, it's, it's the official shop on PC, but I don't know about

1305
02:07:05,800 --> 02:07:11,240
consoles. So, but anyhow, battle net is where you do need to make an account if you don't already

1306
02:07:11,240 --> 02:07:16,920
have one. Um, and then, uh, PC and console players will be able to join matches together for

1307
02:07:16,920 --> 02:07:22,600
quick play arcade and custom. However, competitive will still not match. And I'm assuming that's a

1308
02:07:22,600 --> 02:07:28,360
keyboard mouse versus controller thing. Um, but anyhow, uh, what they say about the match

1309
02:07:28,360 --> 02:07:32,440
making process for competitive games, competitive players will be split into two pools, depending

1310
02:07:32,440 --> 02:07:37,400
on the system, console players and PC players for balanced purposes, PC players and console players

1311
02:07:37,400 --> 02:07:41,400
will not be mixed in the same pool for competitive matches. And I'm pretty sure they're just not

1312
02:07:41,400 --> 02:07:49,480
saying the reason why, but I think, I think I got just explained it. So, uh, anyhow, uh, it does not

1313
02:07:49,480 --> 02:07:54,840
unlock shared progression among consoles. So your cosmetic and your stats are still locked to

1314
02:07:54,840 --> 02:08:01,000
whatever platform they will not transfer. Um, also there was a patch that increases the amount of

1315
02:08:01,000 --> 02:08:06,280
damage that some heroes deal on console to try to, uh, bring a little parody with the PC version.

1316
02:08:06,280 --> 02:08:11,720
That's very interesting. So, uh, yeah. Anyway, it's been five years since Overwatch first came

1317
02:08:11,720 --> 02:08:15,960
out, just as a reminder. So five years later, we finally get cross play. I guess I should check

1318
02:08:15,960 --> 02:08:21,000
that out at some point, to be honest. Um, Mike Deft in chat says, that's the only thing I'm really

1319
02:08:21,000 --> 02:08:26,920
mad about. No cross progression seems dumb. I do agree. It's right there, but the queue times now

1320
02:08:26,920 --> 02:08:31,960
are instant. Yeah. Oh yeah. I'm sure it opened it up a lot more for sure. For sure. It's also

1321
02:08:31,960 --> 02:08:37,480
irritating to me that, you know, dead by daylight has the cross play, but not the cross progression

1322
02:08:37,480 --> 02:08:43,240
unless you're talking, I think stadia and PC is it, you know, it's a very limited set of everything

1323
02:08:43,240 --> 02:08:50,520
that it supports. Technically it's specifically stadia and steam. Oh, thank you. Yes. The other,

1324
02:08:50,520 --> 02:08:55,160
the other services don't do it like a windows store. Yes. Thank you for calling that out

1325
02:08:55,160 --> 02:08:58,920
because you're absolutely right. Cause I think it's ridiculous that windows game stories and

1326
02:08:58,920 --> 02:09:05,480
cross platform with steam, what the hell cross progression anyway. Yeah. I, I, if we pay for

1327
02:09:05,480 --> 02:09:10,520
this stuff, it should be able to go between the consoles. It really should. I mean, I somewhat

1328
02:09:10,520 --> 02:09:17,320
understand Freddy and, uh, the shape and some of the licensed killers and maybe survivors,

1329
02:09:17,320 --> 02:09:22,360
but the original ones, nah, that should, that should all be cross progression. But anyway,

1330
02:09:23,000 --> 02:09:31,240
that's another argument. Uh, moving on dark Sakura. So, um, we, we like to point out when

1331
02:09:31,240 --> 02:09:37,560
really old shit goes for a lot of money, right? Well, a game called air raid that was out on the,

1332
02:09:37,560 --> 02:09:50,520
uh, Atari 2,600 sold for over $10,000. Um, it, uh, basically, uh, an e-commerce item processor

1333
02:09:50,520 --> 02:09:55,720
who is at a four, uh, named Alex Juarez, who is at, uh, Fort worth, Texas based, uh,

1334
02:09:55,720 --> 02:10:03,080
Goodwill center found a copy of air raid. Um, that was published for the Atari 2,600 in 1982 by men

1335
02:10:03,080 --> 02:10:11,400
a vision. Um, it was very limited. Only 13 copies are known to exist. And so, uh, he,

1336
02:10:12,520 --> 02:10:18,520
he would just go into the Atari games as they came in and he took it. Well, I mean, I guess he,

1337
02:10:19,080 --> 02:10:24,520
I mean, I don't know if he took it, maybe he bought it from them, but yeah, something like

1338
02:10:24,520 --> 02:10:33,320
that. Um, a complete edition previously sold for $33,433 and 30 cents in 2012. And another

1339
02:10:33,320 --> 02:10:42,360
cartridge only sold on eBay for 3,575. So this is now Goodwill's highest selling piece item.

1340
02:10:43,160 --> 02:10:49,160
Oh, I guess the Goodwill sold it. So I hate that they got the money. They do some shitty

1341
02:10:49,160 --> 02:10:56,680
things to their employees, but bonds, double a six and chat says, shit air raid. I recall playing

1342
02:10:56,680 --> 02:11:03,400
that game. Well, hold on because there were some very similar sounding games, uh, river raid being

1343
02:11:03,400 --> 02:11:09,560
one of them. And Atari had an original called air C battle that my brain thought this game was at

1344
02:11:09,560 --> 02:11:15,720
first, but air raid was a very specific, it was a blue cartridge that was very funky kind of shape

1345
02:11:15,720 --> 02:11:20,600
to it. And that's what made it so unique. Um, and I, you just said there were like a limited

1346
02:11:20,600 --> 02:11:25,880
number of these, right? So, um, you may, you may, if you have played one, that's very impressive,

1347
02:11:25,880 --> 02:11:31,080
but, um, you may be confusing it with another Atari 2,600 classic. That's very similar sounding.

1348
02:11:31,080 --> 02:11:37,320
So, all right. Uh, yeah. Uh, no one special says, uh, the game was sky blue and had a handle,

1349
02:11:37,320 --> 02:11:42,920
right? Yep. Yep. Yep. So, uh, dark to see it says, yeah, that's the only downside is the Goodwill.

1350
02:11:42,920 --> 02:11:47,880
Um, I thought it was neat to see something super rare, just randomly pop up like that. Hell yeah.

1351
02:11:47,880 --> 02:11:51,880
Like, you know, if I happen to walk by a garage sale, I'm always going to kind of peak and see

1352
02:11:51,880 --> 02:11:55,720
if there's any video games, you know, not that I'm like intentionally looking to flip them,

1353
02:11:55,720 --> 02:11:58,840
but I'm just looking for like, Ooh, is there something fun in here that I just want to buy

1354
02:11:58,840 --> 02:12:02,920
that? Oh, maybe, you know, some I can get, I want it so no one else can have it.

1355
02:12:02,920 --> 02:12:09,640
This is mine. Uh, moving on Logie.

1356
02:12:11,000 --> 02:12:18,680
So this is one of those unfortunate updates that, um, we see from time to time with different games

1357
02:12:18,680 --> 02:12:26,200
that come out. So apparently Marvel's Avengers had received an update where for a brief period of

1358
02:12:26,200 --> 02:12:32,280
time, it was not only displaying your username in game, but it was also displaying a string

1359
02:12:32,280 --> 02:12:40,200
afterwards, which included your IP address. And so that's obviously a problem if, you know,

1360
02:12:40,200 --> 02:12:46,520
users are having their IP address exposed to other players. Um, so thankfully, though, they did,

1361
02:12:46,520 --> 02:12:52,520
they were able to patch this to fix the problem, but it's still kind of embarrassing that it was a

1362
02:12:52,520 --> 02:13:00,440
problem in the first place. Yeah, that's a pretty major thing. And I can't believe they had to

1363
02:13:00,440 --> 02:13:04,840
actually send a thing to like tell streamers, don't play this because, uh, you're not going

1364
02:13:04,840 --> 02:13:10,920
to like the side effects of it. Basically. It's kind of sad. Yeah. Yeah. Very unfortunate. Yeah.

1365
02:13:10,920 --> 02:13:15,240
They did. And Dr. C says, I did hear that it was finally fixed a few days after it was discovered.

1366
02:13:15,240 --> 02:13:19,400
Yes. But that's still a few days that you have a very unfortunate side effect there in the game.

1367
02:13:19,400 --> 02:13:23,160
Very, very, yeah. Especially if you didn't notice it, if you weren't paying attention to,

1368
02:13:23,160 --> 02:13:28,360
you know, the text on there. I mean, it's just, that could be bad. All right. Well,

1369
02:13:28,360 --> 02:13:33,000
lastly, hopefully there will be no, um, side effects, uh, for folks doing this. This is,

1370
02:13:33,000 --> 02:13:38,840
uh, PAX West has declared they will be in person this year. Um, so PAX West, of course,

1371
02:13:38,840 --> 02:13:42,360
you all know this gaming convention, it's going to be happening in person in September,

1372
02:13:42,360 --> 02:13:46,520
and that was announced via press release. Um, and then, uh, tickets will be going on sale,

1373
02:13:46,520 --> 02:13:52,680
$230 for the whole four day weekend, $60 for individual day passes. Um, now of course they

1374
02:13:52,680 --> 02:13:56,920
are saying that there will be different, um, you know, it's going to be a little bit different,

1375
02:13:56,920 --> 02:14:03,240
uh, that there'd be doing attendance limitation. And I believe I read something about masking as

1376
02:14:03,240 --> 02:14:13,160
well. Um, Oh yes. Uh, they did say the packs organizers did say in a tweet, uh, if COVID-19

1377
02:14:13,160 --> 02:14:17,720
remains a major barrier to safely gathering at one of our shows, we won't do it, or we will take it

1378
02:14:17,720 --> 02:14:22,280
virtual as much as we miss even crave the togetherness and magic of packs. We will not put

1379
02:14:22,280 --> 02:14:26,680
attendees exhibitors or our guests at risk for the sake of an event. If things aren't on the up and

1380
02:14:27,160 --> 02:14:32,680
up, um, as I think we got into last year in 2020, a lot of these companies are contractually

1381
02:14:32,680 --> 02:14:38,440
obliged to do something, um, or they could lose everything for good. So, um, I, this comes as no

1382
02:14:38,440 --> 02:14:44,520
surprise to me that packs is happening, um, dragon cons the same weekend. And as to, as of today,

1383
02:14:44,520 --> 02:14:50,280
uh, the plan is I'm going to dragon con. Um, but, uh, you know, again, I'm going to watch

1384
02:14:50,280 --> 02:14:55,560
everything and watch science most importantly. And if, uh, CDC comes out and says, don't do it,

1385
02:14:55,560 --> 02:15:00,520
then we won't do it. But for now we'll see. I'm I gotta say I was out and about in San Francisco

1386
02:15:00,520 --> 02:15:08,680
yesterday. And, uh, I, I was kind of surprised at how busy everything was. I had the Castro was

1387
02:15:08,680 --> 02:15:14,120
still full on in pride mode, even though there wasn't an official pride. So it was very

1388
02:15:14,120 --> 02:15:21,720
interesting. Yeah. So, um, but I'm vaccinated and, uh, that crowd pretty sure they're vaccinated too.

1389
02:15:21,720 --> 02:15:26,280
Um, sure. There's still a breakthrough risk. Um, but you know, you're taking a lot of risks

1390
02:15:26,280 --> 02:15:32,680
whenever you get out of bed. Um, and, uh, we know that vaccines work and vaccines will certainly,

1391
02:15:32,680 --> 02:15:38,120
um, unless you are, uh, older in your eighties, I think the average age is 83.

1392
02:15:38,120 --> 02:15:44,440
Uh, the vaccines will certainly prevent severe like death basically. So, um, yeah. So, I mean,

1393
02:15:45,080 --> 02:15:49,880
again, as it stands today, I don't see a problem with dragon con, but, um, I don't think it's

1394
02:15:49,880 --> 02:15:55,720
going to be the exact same as previous years. I think I will still choose to wear a mask. Um,

1395
02:15:55,720 --> 02:16:01,160
and I hope nobody gives me shit for that because that's my choice. Um, especially when, when in

1396
02:16:01,160 --> 02:16:05,880
transit, basically when I'm walking from my hotel room to the panel room, I will wear a mask when

1397
02:16:05,880 --> 02:16:10,200
I'm in the panel room on stage. I probably won't because there's kind of a built-in social

1398
02:16:10,200 --> 02:16:18,600
distancing when you're sitting on a panel. So, uh, yeah. So, um, yeah. So anyway, lots of people,

1399
02:16:18,600 --> 02:16:22,280
uh, talking about this PAX West, I sort of feel like it's just going to work out. Like there's

1400
02:16:22,280 --> 02:16:27,480
enough people who are kind of like apprehensive about it that aren't going to go, but PAX wants

1401
02:16:27,480 --> 02:16:31,480
to lower the numbers anyway. So I kind of feel like that's going to balance out. I just think

1402
02:16:31,480 --> 02:16:37,400
the two crowds need to play nice. Like if people, if people don't want to go, then the people that

1403
02:16:37,400 --> 02:16:41,880
are going shouldn't like say, oh, why aren't you going? Did it? No, that's somebody's choice to

1404
02:16:41,880 --> 02:16:46,840
make at the same time. If somebody doesn't go, I don't think they need to be holier than thou

1405
02:16:46,840 --> 02:16:53,480
to the people that are going to go. Um, because again, vaccines exist and that's why we took them.

1406
02:16:53,480 --> 02:17:00,600
So we'll see. Um, going into our chat over twitch.tv slash a vog network, uh, pod culture

1407
02:17:00,600 --> 02:17:06,040
says my 99, almost 100 year old grandma is vaccinated. Good, good. And that I hope she,

1408
02:17:06,040 --> 02:17:09,960
she should have been one of the first ones to get it. I know my dad got vaccinated all the way back

1409
02:17:09,960 --> 02:17:15,960
in early February, but he's in his eighties. Um, so he was in that early group. Yeah. All right,

1410
02:17:15,960 --> 02:17:21,080
let's get to the listener round table. We are going to, uh, talk to you guys through various

1411
02:17:21,080 --> 02:17:25,560
methods that you can use to participate with our show. Um, I'll log into discord here in a minute

1412
02:17:25,560 --> 02:17:30,920
at vog network.com slash discord. But first I think we'll go to dark Sakura with our mail bag

1413
02:17:30,920 --> 02:17:38,520
participate at orange lounge, radio.com. So we have two emails. One of them I will just start

1414
02:17:38,520 --> 02:17:47,320
off with hello peoples. Um, there is a, uh, link, uh, from variety about drag race. According to

1415
02:17:47,320 --> 02:17:52,440
variety, one of the great camp classics of 1970s television is getting a drag makeover.

1416
02:17:52,440 --> 02:17:57,000
Apparently several alumni of RuPaul's drag race will recreate an episode of the Brady bunch for

1417
02:17:57,000 --> 02:18:02,520
paramount plus which category does this event fall under a, a reason to take advantage of the

1418
02:18:02,520 --> 02:18:07,640
free child paramount plus B a reason to reactivate your subscription to paramount plus, which you

1419
02:18:07,640 --> 02:18:12,200
deactivated because you ran out of episodes of star Trek discovery to watch C a reason to

1420
02:18:12,200 --> 02:18:17,640
subscribe to paramount plus using a credit card number you got from the dark net D a reason to

1421
02:18:17,640 --> 02:18:22,920
spend the premiere weekend getting drunk off whiskey from high west. I'm not going to

1422
02:18:22,920 --> 02:18:27,480
advertise the distillery final state high west distillery. I don't know who they are. I know

1423
02:18:27,480 --> 02:18:34,680
which one I'm choosing. Stay care entertainment. Uh, I, I, please don't let us do free advertisement.

1424
02:18:35,320 --> 02:18:39,720
Yeah, I just, even though we totally do it, I know I was just to say, but you just advertise

1425
02:18:39,720 --> 02:18:44,600
the Brady bunch special and paramount plus, so you might as well throw in the whiskey thing too.

1426
02:18:44,600 --> 02:18:53,560
I'm going to use somebody else's subscription. Um, yeah, I have sure I have paramount plus and,

1427
02:18:53,560 --> 02:18:58,520
um, it's, it's fine. I think, I don't think irritation that people have with paramount

1428
02:18:58,520 --> 02:19:03,560
plus is specific, specifically about paramount plus, but people have an irritation that there

1429
02:19:03,560 --> 02:19:09,000
are all these different streaming services when Netflix was supposed to be the catch all be all.

1430
02:19:09,000 --> 02:19:14,440
Right. But at the same time, I think if we want there to be competition and we want to make sure

1431
02:19:14,440 --> 02:19:17,400
that, you know, they're all trying to one up each other, there's going to have to be several of

1432
02:19:17,400 --> 02:19:22,040
these. I just think now people are starting to feel like there's too many and I get that,

1433
02:19:22,040 --> 02:19:26,760
believe me, I get that, but there's certainly, I canceled Disney plus I wasn't using it enough.

1434
02:19:27,080 --> 02:19:29,080
I can't pay for the year. Um,

1435
02:19:30,920 --> 02:19:33,880
we'll see, but that's, and then, then I start, I start trading them.

1436
02:19:33,880 --> 02:19:37,160
So like I'll borrow somebody's Disney plus and give them my paramount plus,

1437
02:19:37,160 --> 02:19:40,520
but I've had paramount plus ever since it was CBS all access for the star Trek thing

1438
02:19:40,520 --> 02:19:45,880
that was referred to in the email. Um, so yeah, I mean, I'm using it to watch all stars,

1439
02:19:45,880 --> 02:19:49,400
but that wasn't like the reason I got it. I got it for star Trek and there's a

1440
02:19:49,400 --> 02:19:53,960
decent amount of stuff on there. I feel like as far as, um, those services go,

1441
02:19:53,960 --> 02:19:59,160
I feel like paramount plus probably is one of the stronger ones. Um, but it depends on what

1442
02:19:59,160 --> 02:20:03,880
you like. I don't have HBO max, but I know a lot of people are super into it. I could give a shit

1443
02:20:03,880 --> 02:20:10,440
about friends. Um, but there's other stuff on there too. I guess people like, so anyway. Um,

1444
02:20:10,440 --> 02:20:14,600
yes, I will. I, since I already have paramount plus I've been subbed for years services with CBS

1445
02:20:14,600 --> 02:20:20,280
all access ever since I think I first subbed to CBS all access for the big brother live feeds.

1446
02:20:20,280 --> 02:20:24,440
And since it's only like $5 a month, but that seat, that show has really gone to shit the past

1447
02:20:24,440 --> 02:20:29,480
two or three years, especially just the castings horrific. Um, so, uh, I don't really watch live

1448
02:20:29,480 --> 02:20:33,880
feeds anymore, but I watched the star Trek and the other stuff. So yeah, I'll watch this Brady

1449
02:20:33,880 --> 02:20:37,880
bunch special. I didn't even realize it was a thing until today when somebody showed me a picture or

1450
02:20:37,880 --> 02:20:42,120
it was actually Alan that showed me a picture of candy muse dressed as, uh, I think it was Jan,

1451
02:20:42,920 --> 02:20:47,320
no, which Cindy was Cindy Brady. And I just kind of laughed. I thought it was funny.

1452
02:20:47,320 --> 02:20:51,800
So, cause somebody, uh, photoshopped the gun meme onto that. So it looked like candy muse

1453
02:20:51,800 --> 02:20:58,120
as Cindy Brady holding a gun. That's funny. That's funny. All right. Anyway, um, I'll have to find

1454
02:20:58,120 --> 02:21:05,400
the picture and share it with you. All right. Uh, we have more emails, right? Um, yeah. Did I

1455
02:21:05,400 --> 02:21:10,920
actually click? No, I didn't. Good. Um, hi, you're a fly on the wall for one boardroom meeting in

1456
02:21:10,920 --> 02:21:18,680
gaming history. Which one do you pick? And this comes from D you're a fly on the wall in a board

1457
02:21:18,680 --> 02:21:27,240
room in gaming's history. Trying to find that picture for dark soccer. Sorry. Um, I know I

1458
02:21:27,240 --> 02:21:33,960
would want to be in the boardroom when they decided on the name, we, you and why I want to know what

1459
02:21:33,960 --> 02:21:38,760
the hell they were thinking. I want to know what drugs were on the table that they were all, uh,

1460
02:21:38,760 --> 02:21:44,200
taken. I'm just, I'm half kidding, but I, uh, since, since I'm announcing which Hills I'm

1461
02:21:44,200 --> 02:21:50,280
going to die on tonight, here's another one. Um, the Wii U was tanked by its name period.

1462
02:21:50,280 --> 02:21:55,880
That is the worst name console I think we've ever had. I may, I may regret that comment later,

1463
02:21:55,880 --> 02:22:00,040
but it's one of the worst game name consoles we've ever had. Um, and I want to know what the

1464
02:22:00,040 --> 02:22:03,960
hell they were thinking with that name, especially when it looked and it felt nothing like their

1465
02:22:04,040 --> 02:22:09,960
original Wii. I just, I don't get it. So I want to know, I want to know what the alternative names

1466
02:22:09,960 --> 02:22:16,360
were that they didn't go through with. And I want to know who was fighting for those names and why.

1467
02:22:17,400 --> 02:22:23,320
Well, I know what I would want. What's that? The meeting where they decided to go with Jerry

1468
02:22:23,320 --> 02:22:29,480
Lawson's, uh, game designs for the fair child channel F because it's because of him. We have

1469
02:22:29,480 --> 02:22:35,560
cartridges going way back in history. I like that. I am. Yeah. And then I also know why the

1470
02:22:35,560 --> 02:22:40,920
fuck they did that controller design. Cause it was shit. Um, and yeah, if we're going to talk,

1471
02:22:40,920 --> 02:22:45,960
go way back, then I definitely want to be in some boardrooms, uh, in the old Atari days,

1472
02:22:45,960 --> 02:22:50,200
because there probably were drugs on the table. And I'm very curious about what all was going

1473
02:22:50,200 --> 02:22:54,600
on then. Cause I don't know if y'all know, but a lot of your favorite eighties games were absolutely

1474
02:22:54,600 --> 02:22:59,560
drug and drug influenced. Absolutely. So it's, uh, I think that'd be interesting. Not that I

1475
02:22:59,560 --> 02:23:04,840
condone, not that I condone it, but I just think we should face that reality. I just want to be in

1476
02:23:04,840 --> 02:23:10,040
the boardrooms and they complained about Steve jobs. I would, I'll take the board. I'll take

1477
02:23:10,040 --> 02:23:17,640
the boardroom, um, the directly after the E3 that Konami unveiled the Brock revolution and all the

1478
02:23:17,640 --> 02:23:23,400
fallout from all that. I want to be in that boardroom to see the folks getting yelled out

1479
02:23:23,400 --> 02:23:29,640
about just that. And about like 99 nights and how they displayed that. And just, just like

1480
02:23:30,440 --> 02:23:37,080
the, what the, what the heck? Or, uh, when they decided not to do a sweet code and game so I

1481
02:23:37,080 --> 02:23:45,320
can jump out of the wall and go, you idiots, you absolute fucking idiots. Oh, well, or in the,

1482
02:23:45,320 --> 02:23:51,800
the boardroom, when the folks that did, uh, scabins, uh, Chateau Reneau, we were talking

1483
02:23:51,800 --> 02:23:56,840
about these weird Americans who are talking about their game. That is a great answer. That is,

1484
02:23:56,840 --> 02:24:00,520
I want to definitely, I don't know if that wouldn't necessarily do a boardroom, but it was

1485
02:24:00,520 --> 02:24:05,800
definitely in a conference room with the marketing team. That is a great answer. I'm, I, I, carbon

1486
02:24:05,800 --> 02:24:12,120
copy on that answer. That's, I want to know the reaction to when president cat happened

1487
02:24:12,120 --> 02:24:17,240
and that company. That's great. I got orange rounds radio.

1488
02:24:20,840 --> 02:24:26,680
Like who is, who's that? Who is that? Uh, great question. That was a really good question.

1489
02:24:26,680 --> 02:24:31,400
All right. Yeah. Props to you. I don't know if I can give you a gold star cause the email

1490
02:24:31,400 --> 02:24:36,440
was kind of short, but you definitely get a silver star. Is it the silver star story?

1491
02:24:37,000 --> 02:24:45,000
Sure. Is it lunar? Sure. Girl. Okay. All right. That's it for emails this week, right?

1492
02:24:45,720 --> 02:24:51,720
Yeah, it is. All right. Um, there was a good question in chat, twitch.tv slash vog network,

1493
02:24:51,720 --> 02:24:57,640
no one special 77, which by the way, no one special. Can you please email the show

1494
02:24:57,640 --> 02:25:03,560
or email me personally? Rob at vog network.com. Um, I received a really heartfelt reply to your

1495
02:25:03,560 --> 02:25:07,560
question last week in my Twitter DMS. And I want to forward that to you. That just occurred in my

1496
02:25:07,560 --> 02:25:12,280
mind that I needed to send that to you, um, uh, from somebody who's dealing with something similar.

1497
02:25:12,280 --> 02:25:17,160
So I wanted to send, send that to you. No one special. Anyway, for now, let me read the question,

1498
02:25:17,160 --> 02:25:23,960
uh, from this week. No one special asks, you know, how in the early two thousands video games,

1499
02:25:23,960 --> 02:25:31,000
OST internet radio stations were all the rage. Yes. No one special. We're a little bit aware.

1500
02:25:31,640 --> 02:25:36,840
I'm, I'm laughing with you, not at you because, uh, appropriately on our 19th anniversary,

1501
02:25:36,840 --> 02:25:39,960
if you think about it, the roots of orange lounge radio, if you didn't already know,

1502
02:25:39,960 --> 02:25:46,680
we were a live 365 station and the highlight of the station was the Sunday night life. Well,

1503
02:25:46,680 --> 02:25:51,080
you know, I thought it was the highlight was the Sunday night show. And there were other shows

1504
02:25:51,080 --> 02:25:57,160
throughout the run on life 365. We had, um, uh, remember DMN who has a different name. Now he

1505
02:25:57,160 --> 02:26:03,400
was DMN back in the day. Uh, and then DJ tyrant was on our network. Uh, stay tight. He was here

1506
02:26:03,400 --> 02:26:09,000
and they had a show. Um, and then, uh, there was, I had like two or three spinoff shows at one point

1507
02:26:09,000 --> 02:26:13,880
on the network. But anyway, yes, we played gaming soundtracks. I sent you the picture, right? All

1508
02:26:13,880 --> 02:26:19,480
right. Isn't it great? I'm saving that forever. It's going to be a reaction for me. All right.

1509
02:26:19,480 --> 02:26:24,760
You can thank Alan for that one. Alan, that was the Cindy Brady candy muse gun meme.

1510
02:26:25,640 --> 02:26:31,640
That's the best thing to ever happen. Right. Anyway. Um, sorry, let me get to no one specials

1511
02:26:31,640 --> 02:26:35,080
actual question here. So, you know, how in the early 2000s video games, OST internet radio

1512
02:26:35,080 --> 02:26:41,480
stations were all the rage in this day and age. Can we see a resurgence of those or have they

1513
02:26:41,480 --> 02:26:48,680
gone the way of the dodo due to DMCA? Um, I don't think they've gone the way of the dodo. I don't

1514
02:26:48,680 --> 02:26:54,680
think they're extinct, but I think the demand for those has gone down a bit because, and I, you

1515
02:26:54,680 --> 02:26:58,840
know, I feel like I can speak with some of, somewhat of an authority to this. When we were

1516
02:26:58,840 --> 02:27:02,840
doing orange on radio on life through 65, everything was legal because we paid a fee to

1517
02:27:02,840 --> 02:27:08,440
live through 65 to broadcast on there. And they in turn paid the rate, the, the, the music labels.

1518
02:27:08,440 --> 02:27:13,880
My understanding is life through 65 and services like that are still around. And absolutely there's

1519
02:27:14,760 --> 02:27:19,240
still there. I actually had to go to their website so that I could remember if that's exactly what

1520
02:27:19,240 --> 02:27:24,360
the website was when I did our, I did our Guinness thing. And actually, I'm sorry, I, the, the correct

1521
02:27:24,360 --> 02:27:29,480
terminology, we shouldn't say it's still there. We should say it died and was resurrected by

1522
02:27:29,480 --> 02:27:34,760
somebody else. That's kind of what happened. It's a reincarnation, your reincarnation. Um, so that

1523
02:27:34,760 --> 02:27:39,000
it's, it went the MySpace way. It's not really well, but I think they are still like live radio

1524
02:27:39,000 --> 02:27:42,600
and all that stuff. Uh, and then of course, shout cast is still out there. Shout cast was the

1525
02:27:42,600 --> 02:27:47,960
technology that carried this show. Um, for the first 17 years, we didn't make the move to Twitch

1526
02:27:47,960 --> 02:27:54,040
until the beginning of 2019, January, 2019, maybe December actually. Um, but anyhow, um,

1527
02:27:56,040 --> 02:28:01,320
um, my point is, is that, uh, shout cast still exists and you can find that on shout cast.

1528
02:28:01,320 --> 02:28:08,040
The legal question ability of that stuff is a little bit in doubt. Um, but there are services

1529
02:28:08,040 --> 02:28:13,960
like life 365 that will pay other, you know, folks to do that, uh, and the music rates,

1530
02:28:13,960 --> 02:28:21,000
but also, um, and my real answer, sorry, blah, blah, blah. But, um, the big factor that didn't

1531
02:28:21,000 --> 02:28:28,440
exist in 2002 and 2003, when we were first doing this, that exists now is streaming. It's Spotify,

1532
02:28:28,440 --> 02:28:34,840
it's Apple music, it's Pandora. It's not just streaming, but it's the fact that these Japanese

1533
02:28:34,840 --> 02:28:41,080
gaming companies, uh, and American ones too, have now embraced, most of them have embraced

1534
02:28:41,080 --> 02:28:47,080
the streaming technology. So you can go on and find official final fantasy soundtracks

1535
02:28:47,080 --> 02:28:52,200
on Spotify. You can find official soundtracks to lots of Namco games. I know we're up there.

1536
02:28:52,200 --> 02:28:58,200
Capcom games are up there and so on and so on. So a lot of people are getting it on demand,

1537
02:28:58,200 --> 02:29:02,760
maybe not so much DDR. I think probably because you have a lot of license issues in play there,

1538
02:29:03,000 --> 02:29:07,160
because you have very, very old license that are expired. So they're not on streaming services,

1539
02:29:07,160 --> 02:29:11,960
but I think those games we have to admit are pretty niche when we talk about video game

1540
02:29:11,960 --> 02:29:18,120
soundtracks altogether. Um, so that I think streaming has really cut into that is really

1541
02:29:18,120 --> 02:29:25,240
my long roundabout way of your answer. Um, but no one special wherever there is an internet,

1542
02:29:25,240 --> 02:29:29,320
there will always be someone doing something you're thinking about right now on it.

1543
02:29:29,320 --> 02:29:37,000
If you know what I mean. Um, let's see. Tiger con chat says mix cloud started a streaming

1544
02:29:37,000 --> 02:29:41,400
service for DJs to broadcast their live sets to avoid any of the copyright issues. That's smart.

1545
02:29:41,400 --> 02:29:45,960
That's very smart. And I was also going to say no one special. I think a lot of the audience for

1546
02:29:45,960 --> 02:29:53,640
that went to Twitch slash YouTube slash I guess Facebook gaming, uh, slash, you know, those types

1547
02:29:53,640 --> 02:29:58,760
of, uh, video, video on demand services. Um, I think a lot of the audience went there and

1548
02:29:58,760 --> 02:30:03,400
that's a big reason why we're on Twitch. To be honest, uh, quest buster does point out. There's

1549
02:30:03,400 --> 02:30:09,720
a few on YouTube that stream video game tracks and I, YouTube will have the legal and the

1550
02:30:09,720 --> 02:30:15,240
questionably legal stuff on there. So I, I YouTube is a great call out. Um, other ones I found were

1551
02:30:15,240 --> 02:30:19,800
bundled under other services, but there's also outfits like radio Sega that does radio type

1552
02:30:19,800 --> 02:30:25,080
shows. And I've been broadcasting classic Sega music for years. Um, our friends, uh,

1553
02:30:25,080 --> 02:30:29,800
with girls gone. Wow. That used to be here at the voice of geeks network. They left the network

1554
02:30:29,800 --> 02:30:34,680
because they went to Warcraft radio, which broadcast 24 seven about Warcraft radio. And I

1555
02:30:34,680 --> 02:30:39,720
get it. They're a Warcraft show. Why wouldn't they want to be on a Warcraft network? So they went

1556
02:30:39,720 --> 02:30:43,640
over there and, uh, I, I know they do a lot of talk programming, but I'm pretty sure they've

1557
02:30:43,640 --> 02:30:48,600
got to play some music from the games in between all that stuff. So, um, you know, there's that

1558
02:30:48,600 --> 02:30:53,560
that exists as well for sure. So, all right. It's weird as I actually see a lot of folks,

1559
02:30:53,560 --> 02:30:59,400
um, big streamers out there, they're using Nintendo music, like animal crossing and stuff

1560
02:30:59,400 --> 02:31:06,200
like that in their streams, which I think is just completely bold to do considering how litigious

1561
02:31:06,200 --> 02:31:10,840
Nintendo is. Do you know how many memes I've seen with the Wii shop music though?

1562
02:31:12,280 --> 02:31:17,640
Like there's a great drag race clip out there of Brooklyn Heights in untucked when she's like

1563
02:31:17,640 --> 02:31:23,160
cringing and all this, and it's set to the Wii shop music. And it's so funny. You've seen that

1564
02:31:23,160 --> 02:31:28,120
dark Sakura. I've heard of it. I haven't seen it. Oh, I got to find it. It's great. All right.

1565
02:31:28,120 --> 02:31:33,880
Anyway, uh, enough, uh, enough of the, uh, um, chat question there, but that was a very good

1566
02:31:33,880 --> 02:31:37,640
question. Thank you. No one special. Uh, and you, I'm going to also give you a silver star

1567
02:31:37,640 --> 02:31:42,200
because that was a question that had nothing to do with the stores or sales or anything like that.

1568
02:31:42,200 --> 02:31:47,240
And that was another very good question. So a silver star for you. All right. Maybe you can

1569
02:31:47,240 --> 02:31:52,120
combine your star with our emailer and then you'll have one gold star. Maybe that's a currency.

1570
02:31:52,120 --> 02:32:00,520
We need to start here at OLR. All right. Uh, I would love to have our own Bitcoin. Are you

1571
02:32:00,520 --> 02:32:04,920
kidding? Even though I think some of it's really silly. I think it's just like a parody. It'd be

1572
02:32:04,920 --> 02:32:09,560
fun. All right. Uh, in, in, on a serious note, uh, Loki, any last minute stories? I'm pulling

1573
02:32:09,560 --> 02:32:16,440
up our discord here and yeah, we've got lots of depressing news. Let's go into it. So, so start

1574
02:32:16,440 --> 02:32:26,600
starting off, uh, we had a developer of, um, the emulator, uh, or the SNES emulator, um,

1575
02:32:26,600 --> 02:32:34,840
B SNES and high again near he has taken his life. So, um, I actually saw this in cause I have

1576
02:32:34,840 --> 02:32:40,680
followed the, the nest of community and stuff. So I actually saw this in our discord and, uh,

1577
02:32:40,680 --> 02:32:45,960
I didn't really know who he was, but I knew he was a developer. I just didn't know on an emulator,

1578
02:32:46,040 --> 02:32:52,760
but apparently this is from a long, basically lots of online harassment that he's been receiving

1579
02:32:52,760 --> 02:32:59,560
cyber bullying. Um, I guess a lot of it coming from this hub called Kiwi farms, but yeah,

1580
02:32:59,560 --> 02:33:07,720
apparently it's just added up over time. And he kind of put out this long thread on Twitter,

1581
02:33:07,720 --> 02:33:14,120
you know, basically saying goodbye. So that was kind of a red flag right there. And then

1582
02:33:14,600 --> 02:33:18,120
I need to make sure I need to make sure this isn't sugar coated because it's

1583
02:33:18,120 --> 02:33:21,320
fucking pride month and we're not going to do that. And looky, I'm not blaming you. I'm

1584
02:33:21,320 --> 02:33:26,520
saying this story. We need to call this out is my understanding is that near or a view,

1585
02:33:26,520 --> 02:33:32,840
I think was another name that was used previously. It was non-binary. Um, although I think they were,

1586
02:33:32,840 --> 02:33:38,120
well, I think I'm not sure the pronouns were ever clarified, but to be fair, uh, they, they,

1587
02:33:38,120 --> 02:33:45,480
they identified as non-binary. Um, how, however, what's gross about it is that this website that

1588
02:33:45,480 --> 02:33:50,680
you had mentioned, uh, what was the name of that site again? Kiwi farms was targeting this

1589
02:33:50,680 --> 02:33:55,720
individual because they were non-binary and that's the gross shit that has to be called out because

1590
02:33:55,720 --> 02:34:01,000
that is, I mean, I'm, I was going to say it's unforgivable. It's unforgivable. I was going

1591
02:34:01,000 --> 02:34:06,200
to sit here and get very angry and say it's unacceptable because it is, but I'm not sure

1592
02:34:06,280 --> 02:34:12,360
what getting angry is going to do because now, if you're wondering when is this cyber bullying

1593
02:34:12,360 --> 02:34:18,120
going to get to the point where somebody does something very, very, here we are.

1594
02:34:19,480 --> 02:34:26,200
It's, it's now happened. So if you visit the, I don't think any OLR people do this,

1595
02:34:26,200 --> 02:34:28,840
but I'm just going to say this, even if I'm saying it to the choir,

1596
02:34:28,840 --> 02:34:36,200
if you visit these websites, if you post on these forums, if you contribute to this culture,

1597
02:34:37,800 --> 02:34:44,440
I want you to sit there and really think long and hard about this. And I want you to wonder how good

1598
02:34:44,440 --> 02:34:53,080
you feel about this. This, this is horrible. This, that culture targeting people based on

1599
02:34:54,040 --> 02:35:04,120
who they are disgusting, flush it down the internet, flush it away. Anyway,

1600
02:35:04,840 --> 02:35:11,800
that's all I have to say. Sorry. Thank you. And then, uh, going from that, uh, river, uh,

1601
02:35:11,800 --> 02:35:18,280
the real life dog counterpart for the in game dog dog meat from final out four has also died.

1602
02:35:19,240 --> 02:35:26,680
No. Oh yeah. I heard about that too. Oh, that's, that's sad. Yeah. Yeah. Losing pets is very hard.

1603
02:35:28,520 --> 02:35:34,280
All right. So there you go. I'm like, can you give us one more story,

1604
02:35:34,280 --> 02:35:40,600
please? To change the tone. Um, all right. Raccoon city police department still isn't

1605
02:35:40,600 --> 02:35:45,640
playable except in custom matches for dead by daylight. Okay. Um, wait, I'm going to,

1606
02:35:45,640 --> 02:35:50,280
I'm going to find something from our discord over at vog network.com slash discord,

1607
02:35:50,280 --> 02:35:54,120
where people post stories throughout the week in the orange lounge radio channel.

1608
02:35:54,120 --> 02:35:58,200
And we'd like to read some of that on air, although a lot of these, we did get to, okay,

1609
02:35:58,200 --> 02:36:04,200
this one's funny. I'll do this one. So this is funny. Um, 13 X forever actually posted a tweet,

1610
02:36:04,200 --> 02:36:10,280
uh, from user way bullocks, not to be confused with, you know, who, um, but it is, um, I'm not

1611
02:36:10,280 --> 02:36:15,240
a lawyer or anything, but this feels like a lawsuit waiting to happen. And it's a screen grab from

1612
02:36:15,640 --> 02:36:21,720
evil two and then a screen grab for the walking dead survivors. That is literally pictures

1613
02:36:21,720 --> 02:36:27,800
photoshopped right on top of the resident evil to cover art. So somebody made a boo-boo there.

1614
02:36:27,800 --> 02:36:33,560
However, in reading the replies, some people are saying that this was all made up. Um,

1615
02:36:33,560 --> 02:36:37,560
but then other people are saying, no, it was an advertisement that they were using.

1616
02:36:37,560 --> 02:36:42,360
So there's a little bit of controversy as to, is the artwork real or not? So take it with a

1617
02:36:42,360 --> 02:36:47,720
grain of salt, I suppose, but I could certainly see something like that with a salt lick. Yeah,

1618
02:36:47,720 --> 02:36:53,880
for sure. For sure. Um, let's see. And then, uh, Oh, this is interesting from dungeon buster.

1619
02:36:53,880 --> 02:36:59,480
TSR games is back the studio behind the original dungeons and dragons, like those old school.

1620
02:36:59,480 --> 02:37:03,720
I'm talking to the old school games on like Commodore 64, apple two E, you know, the old,

1621
02:37:03,720 --> 02:37:09,480
old school ones, uh, they have returned to Lake Geneva, Wisconsin under Gary Gygax Jr.

1622
02:37:10,200 --> 02:37:16,120
That's right. Yeah. So they're coming back. That's an official press release from a PR.com

1623
02:37:17,000 --> 02:37:19,880
link there in our discord. That is really cool. I wonder what they're going to make.

1624
02:37:20,920 --> 02:37:27,080
Hmm. Very cool. I don't have the license for D and D cause that was sold. Yeah,

1625
02:37:27,080 --> 02:37:31,960
but they could still do something maybe inspired by the old inspired by is the keyword there.

1626
02:37:31,960 --> 02:37:38,200
And especially the old games, who knows there. So, um, anyway, um, uh, that is a very much happier

1627
02:37:38,200 --> 02:37:42,360
note to end on. There's a, that studio coming back. Very, very cool. Um,

1628
02:37:44,920 --> 02:37:52,200
go ahead, family in general is questionable. Uh, yeah, but you know, I understand if they

1629
02:37:52,200 --> 02:37:58,120
want to get the license, they have to maybe make deals that, you know, no, I'm just saying

1630
02:37:58,120 --> 02:38:04,600
as people. Yeah, I know. All right. Anyhow, let's get to our final thoughts for tonight,

1631
02:38:05,080 --> 02:38:09,560
and wrap the show up. Uh, and, uh, thank you guys once again for listening to our show and

1632
02:38:09,560 --> 02:38:13,560
staying up late with us tonight. We appreciate you guys being here. Um, if you like what you

1633
02:38:13,560 --> 02:38:16,840
heard at the show, tell a friend or two about the show, help us spread the word because we

1634
02:38:16,840 --> 02:38:20,440
are the show where every gamer has a voice, but if the voices aren't here to put out on air,

1635
02:38:20,440 --> 02:38:25,080
well then what can we do? So, um, yes, please help us spread the word. Um, a nice five star

1636
02:38:25,080 --> 02:38:29,320
review on a site like iTunes, Spotify, wherever it is you found this show. Um, that goes an awful

1637
02:38:29,320 --> 02:38:35,320
long way. Uh, and, um, yeah, social media posts, uh, auto hosts here on Twitch are wonderful.

1638
02:38:35,320 --> 02:38:39,240
Thank you to everybody who auto hosts Vogue network here on Twitch. Um, I also want to

02:39:34,600 --> 02:39:39,560
by daylight because that's my addiction right now. People are already setting out, setting off

1651
02:39:39,560 --> 02:39:47,560
fucking fireworks outside and I want to set them on fire. All right. Have a good one. Uh, Loki,

1653
02:39:52,520 --> 02:39:55,960
Hopefully I'll have another episode out this week. At least that's what I'm going for.

1654
02:39:56,600 --> 02:40:03,240
Um, can't wait for you to see my shop. It's very cute. Um, and then my final thought tonight,

1655
02:40:03,240 --> 02:40:07,160
um, just, you know, I, I have lots of other projects I want to work on, but I have some

1656
02:40:07,160 --> 02:40:10,920
other things in my personal life. There could be some big changes coming in the next week or two.

1657
02:40:10,920 --> 02:40:16,280
So everybody crushed fingers and happy vibes. Uh, that's all I really need. Thank you. Thank you.

1658
02:40:16,280 --> 02:40:21,640
Um, and thanks everybody for sticking with us for the last 19 years, whether you found us 19 years

1659
02:40:21,640 --> 02:40:27,000
ago or 19 minutes ago, really appreciate you guys being here, um, at orange launch radio. Thanks.

1660
02:40:27,000 --> 02:40:32,920
And we will be back in two weeks. Um, everybody in the States have a happy, have a safe, um,

1661
02:40:32,920 --> 02:40:38,440
but have a very positive 4th of July, especially after the last 15 months. Um, I hope you have a

1662
02:40:38,440 --> 02:40:42,840
great one, but please be safe, uh, in all elements of the word for those of you in other countries.

1663
02:40:42,840 --> 02:40:47,080
I know the 4th of July is just another day. Uh, so I'm sorry, we won't be here next week,

1664
02:40:47,080 --> 02:40:51,400
but I still hope no matter what you're doing next Sunday, um, you're, you're having a good

1665
02:40:51,400 --> 02:40:56,760
time. You're safe, having fun with video games and all that stuff. Have a wonderful two weeks.

1666
02:40:56,760 --> 02:41:01,960
We'll be back on July 11th to do it all again. Good luck to Bobby and summer games done quick.

1667
02:41:01,960 --> 02:41:07,000
I'm looking forward to watching, uh, and donating for the charity doctors without borders. Uh,

1668
02:41:07,000 --> 02:41:10,280
I don't think I have anything else to squeeze in here at the end. So it's time to roll the credits.
