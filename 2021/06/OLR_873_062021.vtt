00:00.000 --> 00:13.720
Over its lifetime, the Xbox One eventually gained backwards compatibility for some titles

00:13.720 --> 00:16.920
as far back as the Xbox, well, the very first Xbox.

00:16.920 --> 00:21.440
But soon, Xbox One owners could gain the ability to play some Xbox Series S and X titles, presumably

00:21.440 --> 00:22.560
via Game Pass.

00:22.560 --> 00:26.360
PlayStation Now has, of course, provided similar features like this for many years already.

00:26.360 --> 00:28.080
This is likely a new majority trend of gaming.

00:28.080 --> 00:31.280
And now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki, to tell you more

00:31.280 --> 00:34.000
about this and the rest of the week's news, starting right now on the show, where every

00:34.000 --> 00:37.000
gamer has a voice.

00:37.000 --> 00:44.360
Hello, my friends out there on the internet.

00:44.360 --> 00:48.620
Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:48.620 --> 00:56.600
It is Orange Lounge Radio, and we are back and live once again with episode number 873

00:56.600 --> 01:00.200
of our show for June 20th, 2021.

01:00.200 --> 01:04.960
My name is Rob Roberts, and I'm joining you here every week with my co-hosts.

01:04.960 --> 01:08.560
First off, DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers, not here at the moment.

01:08.560 --> 01:12.200
She's going to come into the show a little bit later on around 7 o'clock Pacific time,

01:12.200 --> 01:13.200
10 o'clock Eastern.

01:13.200 --> 01:15.340
So we'll say hi to her a little later.

01:15.340 --> 01:19.480
But we do have joining us right off the top of the show, we have Loki joining us.

01:19.480 --> 01:20.480
Hi, Loki.

01:20.480 --> 01:21.480
Hello.

01:21.480 --> 01:22.480
How's it going?

01:22.480 --> 01:23.480
Hi, how are you?

01:23.480 --> 01:24.480
I'm doing pretty good.

01:24.480 --> 01:25.480
Rushing around.

01:25.480 --> 01:26.480
Yeah.

01:27.360 --> 01:29.200
Kind of running around there at the last minute before the show starts tonight.

01:29.200 --> 01:32.360
Hold on, my bridge is still open.

01:32.360 --> 01:33.360
You're okay.

01:33.360 --> 01:34.800
I have no idea what's going on over there.

01:34.800 --> 01:35.800
That's fine.

01:35.800 --> 01:39.960
And, you know, it's the joy of doing live stuff because my headphones that I usually

01:39.960 --> 01:43.420
hear Loki on just decided they're not going to work tonight.

01:43.420 --> 01:46.760
So something's weird with my setup on how I listen to things.

01:46.760 --> 01:48.880
So that's another thing I've got to try to fix behind the scenes.

01:48.880 --> 01:53.080
Luckily, I can still hear him from the TV that's in the studio here.

01:53.080 --> 01:54.560
But it's a little harder to hear.

01:54.640 --> 01:57.480
I prefer the headphones.

01:57.480 --> 02:00.960
But that's just the joy of running and doing things live sometimes.

02:00.960 --> 02:01.960
Things happen.

02:01.960 --> 02:02.960
Oh, thank you.

02:02.960 --> 02:03.960
SG100 Matt gave me the Intel.

02:03.960 --> 02:04.960
His fridge is open.

02:04.960 --> 02:05.960
That's what he said.

02:05.960 --> 02:06.960
Thank you.

02:06.960 --> 02:07.960
The live chat.

02:07.960 --> 02:09.640
Always here to save the day because we do tape live.

02:09.640 --> 02:11.520
Every Sunday night.

02:11.520 --> 02:12.520
What's that?

02:12.520 --> 02:16.400
I was going to say I shut it really quickly because I was putting my dinner stuff away.

02:16.400 --> 02:18.960
And it's got like this weird latch on it.

02:18.960 --> 02:21.440
So if you shut it too fast, it stays open.

02:21.440 --> 02:23.000
I see.

02:23.000 --> 02:24.000
That sounds complicated.

02:24.440 --> 02:25.440
That's all right.

02:25.440 --> 02:26.440
All right.

02:26.440 --> 02:27.440
News for everybody.

02:27.440 --> 02:28.440
All right.

02:28.440 --> 02:29.440
Let's see.

02:29.440 --> 02:31.440
What else I want to say?

02:31.440 --> 02:34.840
Yes, we do have our chat room because we do tape live every Sunday night at six o'clock

02:34.840 --> 02:39.820
Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern at twitch.tv slash vog network right after the Bobby Black

02:39.820 --> 02:40.820
Wolf show.

02:40.820 --> 02:42.520
And Loki, I wanted to say as well.

02:42.520 --> 02:43.520
Happy Father's Day.

02:43.520 --> 02:49.320
It is that day and happy Father's Day to all the gamer dads out there and all my gamer

02:49.320 --> 02:50.320
daddies.

02:50.320 --> 02:51.320
Wink wink nudge nudge.

02:51.320 --> 02:53.440
I hope you all are having a wonderful day.

02:54.440 --> 02:56.920
Was your day full of Metroid I see playing behind you?

02:56.920 --> 03:00.520
I think that's Metroid Zero Mission specifically.

03:00.520 --> 03:02.080
That's Metroid Fusion, actually.

03:02.080 --> 03:03.840
Oh, my bad.

03:03.840 --> 03:07.360
So no, it was not playing Metroid at all.

03:07.360 --> 03:13.560
It was roller skating and grocery shopping.

03:13.560 --> 03:14.560
I see.

03:14.560 --> 03:20.400
And rushing to finish while rushing to upload my video because for those who don't follow

03:20.400 --> 03:26.320
me on Twitter, Comcast decided to be Comcast for the last two days.

03:26.320 --> 03:31.380
And so I haven't had internet for like a day and a half just on the weekend, too, which

03:31.380 --> 03:32.380
is great.

03:32.380 --> 03:35.760
Perfect timing because I had my I stayed up till two in the morning to get my episode

03:35.760 --> 03:36.760
done.

03:36.760 --> 03:39.560
It's ready to upload it and buy internet.

03:39.560 --> 03:44.260
So it's yeah, that was fun.

03:44.260 --> 03:47.440
And the kids, you know, they don't like not having internet.

03:47.440 --> 03:49.200
They kind of bounce off the walls.

03:49.200 --> 03:52.320
So yeah, it was unfortunate.

03:52.320 --> 03:54.680
So I finally got that uploaded this afternoon.

03:54.680 --> 03:59.240
So my brand new episode with Tango Tech from Hermitcraft is up, which is amazing.

03:59.240 --> 04:04.680
I had a really great time with him last week, and it was very exciting to be able to cut

04:04.680 --> 04:06.440
that down once again.

04:06.440 --> 04:11.880
I listened back to it as I was editing it, and I don't like listening to well, this is

04:11.880 --> 04:15.000
going to be interesting going into Wednesday because I don't like listening back to myself

04:15.000 --> 04:21.040
as it is and listening back to myself when I'm incredibly nervous, made me incredibly

04:21.040 --> 04:22.040
nervous.

04:22.040 --> 04:23.760
So that was fun.

04:23.760 --> 04:30.520
But I did get to cut it down to make it seem like I'm less nervous than I actually was,

04:30.520 --> 04:31.520
which is good.

04:31.520 --> 04:36.520
But yeah, go check it out if you can, you know, hopefully people find it because I mean,

04:36.520 --> 04:37.600
it's pretty amazing.

04:37.600 --> 04:41.600
And I know I've been watching a lot of Hermitcraft season eight that they just started.

04:41.600 --> 04:42.600
So yeah.

04:43.200 --> 04:44.200
Yeah.

04:44.200 --> 04:45.200
Keep on going.

04:45.200 --> 04:46.200
Excellent.

04:46.200 --> 04:47.680
I fixed my headphone problems while you were talking there.

04:47.680 --> 04:48.680
Thank you.

04:48.680 --> 04:51.800
ST100Matt actually links that video there live in our chat room.

04:51.800 --> 04:55.240
I'm sure for those that are not listening live tonight, because of course, we love all

04:55.240 --> 04:57.480
the podcast listeners as well.

04:57.480 --> 04:58.920
Hopefully you can get the link there.

04:58.920 --> 05:03.120
I'm sure that'll be in our Discord server if it's not already, then yeah.

05:03.120 --> 05:06.640
Speaking of things to check out, I do need to give this one cheap plug at the top of

05:06.640 --> 05:07.640
the show.

05:07.640 --> 05:10.800
I don't like to push the stuff to spend money on a lot.

05:10.800 --> 05:14.720
But you know, some people ask like, can I get a shirt that says Orange Lounge Radio

05:14.720 --> 05:15.720
on it?

05:15.720 --> 05:16.720
Yes, you can.

05:16.720 --> 05:19.040
We've actually done a really big update to our store.

05:19.040 --> 05:24.280
So if you haven't checked out the shop, check that out over at vognetwork.com slash shop.

05:24.280 --> 05:28.640
And now not only can you get that cool little OLR pixel logo, but Jamie went in there made

05:28.640 --> 05:29.640
some new stuff.

05:29.640 --> 05:33.720
So there's a very like Sega inspired Orange Lounge Radio type of shirt you can get.

05:33.720 --> 05:36.120
You can get a one piece swimsuit if that's your thing.

05:36.120 --> 05:40.400
Loki, I'm sure you're very excited to hear that you can get some stickers.

05:40.400 --> 05:42.400
You can get some tumblers.

05:42.400 --> 05:46.600
You can get there's actually a fanny pack like my wife would be super.

05:46.600 --> 05:47.600
You can get a fanny.

05:47.600 --> 05:49.360
Apparently, that's the hot merch.

05:49.360 --> 05:50.940
Somebody else is bringing that up earlier.

05:50.940 --> 05:53.360
So fanny packs are all the rage again.

05:53.360 --> 05:55.100
And then actually speaking of pixel logos.

05:55.100 --> 05:56.100
So we have some really cool.

05:56.100 --> 05:58.740
OK, so dark soccer did a new Orange Lounge Radio logo.

05:58.740 --> 06:01.980
She did a cool little retro kind of vog network look.

06:01.980 --> 06:02.980
That's pretty cool.

06:02.980 --> 06:03.980
So check that out.

06:03.980 --> 06:08.960
And then speaking of retro looks, Loki's vog pixel art we talked about on the show a couple

06:08.960 --> 06:10.120
weeks ago.

06:10.120 --> 06:13.880
He just had to resend me the email and go, I sent this to you months ago, dummy.

06:13.880 --> 06:14.880
No, he didn't say that.

06:14.880 --> 06:16.860
But that's that's definitely what I heard.

06:16.860 --> 06:17.860
That's OK.

06:17.860 --> 06:18.860
He said that.

06:18.860 --> 06:24.060
And that's it's like my work, you know, where the well, the tone of your email.

06:24.060 --> 06:25.220
There's no tone in the email.

06:25.220 --> 06:26.220
It's text.

06:26.220 --> 06:29.640
Well, I interpreted it as you were angry.

06:29.640 --> 06:33.160
Loki started off his email saying per my prior email.

06:33.160 --> 06:34.160
He did.

06:34.160 --> 06:35.160
No, he was totally fine.

06:35.160 --> 06:36.160
I'm just giving a shit.

06:36.160 --> 06:38.560
I feel like a dummy because you totally had sent that before.

06:38.560 --> 06:39.560
But things happen.

06:40.000 --> 06:44.000
But now the vog pixel stuff is up on the show up on the shop, too.

06:44.000 --> 06:47.200
So, yeah, there's there's in fact, I think we put so much stuff on there.

06:47.200 --> 06:48.300
We had to get rid of stuff.

06:48.300 --> 06:50.140
I don't think you can get the vog masks anymore.

06:50.140 --> 06:51.960
They might if they're still there.

06:51.960 --> 06:55.960
It's not going to be for much longer because we kind of collaboratively decided those are

06:55.960 --> 06:57.240
the first things being pulled.

06:57.240 --> 07:02.200
I didn't care for the masks myself, but, you know, I guess if some people wanted them,

07:02.200 --> 07:03.200
that's cool, too.

07:03.200 --> 07:04.200
So.

07:04.200 --> 07:05.200
All right.

07:05.200 --> 07:06.200
There you go.

07:06.200 --> 07:07.520
She Hulk in chat.

07:07.520 --> 07:08.520
Thank you.

07:08.520 --> 07:09.520
Saying push it.

07:10.480 --> 07:11.480
So sell in the store.

07:11.480 --> 07:12.480
Yes, I will.

07:12.480 --> 07:13.480
And thank you very much for the biddies.

07:13.480 --> 07:14.480
Appreciate that.

07:14.480 --> 07:15.480
All right.

07:15.480 --> 07:16.480
Let's get it.

07:16.480 --> 07:17.480
OK.

07:17.480 --> 07:18.480
Bobby says the masks are gone.

07:18.480 --> 07:19.480
OK.

07:19.480 --> 07:20.480
That's what I thought, because I know there's like a ton of new stuff in there.

07:20.480 --> 07:21.480
And I know Bobby still wants to add a couple of things, too.

07:21.480 --> 07:24.000
So I know we want to make sure we have enough room for everybody's stuff.

07:24.000 --> 07:25.000
So.

07:25.000 --> 07:26.000
All right.

07:26.000 --> 07:27.000
Check that out.

07:27.000 --> 07:28.000
Again, vog network dot com slash shop.

07:28.000 --> 07:29.000
Let's get to news.

07:29.000 --> 07:31.760
This was kind of the second half of E3 week.

07:31.760 --> 07:36.680
There were some, you know, live I can't always say press conferences, but that's not really

07:36.680 --> 07:38.660
what they are this year.

07:38.820 --> 07:43.380
Kind of the presentations, direct presentations, whatever you want to call them.

07:43.380 --> 07:45.100
There was a few of them.

07:45.100 --> 07:48.100
Capcom had one and it was extremely not notable.

07:48.100 --> 07:49.100
I'm sorry.

07:49.100 --> 07:52.060
Sorry if you're a Capcom fan, but I think everybody who watched that presentation kind

07:52.060 --> 07:57.340
of saw they didn't really give any new stuff, which is fine.

07:57.340 --> 08:01.580
I guess they kind of promoted it in other places, except they said, oh, we're making

08:01.580 --> 08:04.780
DLC for Resident Evil 8 Village because it's so popular.

08:04.780 --> 08:05.780
Thank you.

08:05.980 --> 08:09.300
We hadn't started it yet, but we're going to get right on that.

08:09.300 --> 08:10.300
So there's that.

08:10.300 --> 08:11.300
Yeah.

08:11.300 --> 08:12.300
Yeah.

08:12.300 --> 08:13.300
It was interesting.

08:13.300 --> 08:14.300
Quest Buster says no.

08:14.300 --> 08:15.300
Rob's right.

08:15.300 --> 08:16.300
The Capcom one was pretty trash.

08:16.300 --> 08:17.880
I think there was a Bandai Namco one, too.

08:17.880 --> 08:20.840
But again, I don't think it gave us anything really new.

08:20.840 --> 08:24.320
I think it was kind of just the stuff we already knew about, which I understand these kind

08:24.320 --> 08:26.220
of presentations that come a little late.

08:26.220 --> 08:29.820
I don't want to give too much shit because these presentations that come a little late

08:29.820 --> 08:34.620
kind of have to read like how is Bandai Namco going to one up themselves after they put

08:34.660 --> 08:38.620
that Elden Ring trailer in the Summer Games Fest thing.

08:38.620 --> 08:43.580
Like, you know, it's but, you know, maybe sometimes people hope like, oh, maybe we'll

08:43.580 --> 08:46.500
get gameplay or we'll get as a B trailer.

08:46.500 --> 08:47.500
Yeah.

08:47.500 --> 08:48.500
No, I guess.

08:48.500 --> 08:49.500
Guess none of that as well.

08:49.500 --> 08:50.500
So.

08:50.500 --> 08:51.500
Yeah.

08:51.500 --> 08:57.420
Anyway, Bobby Blackwolf is pointing out the E3 2008, the small one that wasn't in Santa

08:57.420 --> 09:00.140
Monica, was the only Capcom presser I attended.

09:00.140 --> 09:01.340
There was no game news.

09:01.340 --> 09:05.380
It was just Avi Arad and some other people talking about how great the Lost Planet movie

09:05.380 --> 09:06.380
was going to be.

09:06.380 --> 09:07.460
I remember that one.

09:07.460 --> 09:08.460
Yeah.

09:08.460 --> 09:11.900
So sometimes these ones that are a little later, I mean, Konami always used to go late

09:11.900 --> 09:12.900
in the game, too.

09:12.900 --> 09:15.540
And we saw how well that worked out for them a couple of years in a row.

09:15.540 --> 09:16.540
Right.

09:16.540 --> 09:17.540
So, yeah.

09:17.540 --> 09:20.940
So it's going to be great because it only lives in my imagination.

09:20.940 --> 09:21.940
Yeah.

09:21.940 --> 09:27.220
So most of the press events and stuff this week were not that exciting.

09:27.220 --> 09:31.660
Let's be real or already had news that had come out before last week's show.

09:31.660 --> 09:36.820
However, of course, Tuesday morning was the one that I think unarguably everyone was

09:36.820 --> 09:39.420
really waiting for and knew would be the biggest one.

09:39.420 --> 09:41.660
And that was the Nintendo Direct.

09:41.660 --> 09:45.700
So let's recap a little bit about the Nintendo Direct and folks thoughts on that.

09:45.700 --> 09:47.940
So, Loki, I know you watched it.

09:47.940 --> 09:49.020
You actually watched it live.

09:49.020 --> 09:50.020
I had to watch it.

09:50.020 --> 09:52.180
I had to do the tape delay thing.

09:52.180 --> 09:56.460
I had to do the thing like when we watch the Grammys on the West Coast.

09:56.460 --> 10:00.180
It already aired on the East Coast, but we get the three hour tape delay.

10:00.180 --> 10:02.680
The only one of those shows they don't actually I never watched the Grammys.

10:02.680 --> 10:03.680
They're kind of garbage.

10:03.680 --> 10:07.460
But it was just the first award show that came to mind that wasn't the Oscars or the

10:07.460 --> 10:11.700
Super Bowl, because those are the two things that do air live on the West and East Coast

10:11.700 --> 10:12.700
at the same time.

10:12.700 --> 10:14.580
But most everything else, you have to wait three hours for.

10:14.580 --> 10:18.460
So I had to watch the Nintendo Direct that way because I had I had meetings at work like

10:18.460 --> 10:20.100
I couldn't get out of day job stuff.

10:20.100 --> 10:21.100
It's important.

10:21.100 --> 10:24.300
Well, I had meetings, too, but, you know, I just don't care.

10:24.300 --> 10:30.820
No, I kind of had to lead mine, so well, OK, well, yeah, we had I had a meeting at

10:30.820 --> 10:31.820
the same time.

10:31.820 --> 10:33.820
It was about like.

10:33.820 --> 10:40.700
It was about being motivated to like to be more organized and stuff, and it was just

10:40.700 --> 10:43.380
a big old waste of time, so I popped this on instead.

10:43.380 --> 10:45.460
It was way more interesting.

10:45.460 --> 10:50.100
Love that you had a meeting about work motivation and you're sitting there watching this Nintendo

10:50.100 --> 10:51.100
thing.

10:51.100 --> 10:52.100
It cracks me up.

10:52.300 --> 10:56.860
I actually waited until I had an appropriate break, like an hour and a half later, and

10:56.860 --> 11:01.020
then I was like, OK, I can probably watch this 40 minute presentation in 30 minutes

11:01.020 --> 11:04.300
because I'll just fast forward all the game footage about things that I'm just like, I

11:04.300 --> 11:05.620
don't really need to see it.

11:05.620 --> 11:06.620
So, yeah.

11:06.620 --> 11:09.420
And yeah, I would say I actually didn't do that as much as you think.

11:09.420 --> 11:11.300
I probably got through it in about thirty five minutes.

11:11.300 --> 11:12.300
So.

11:12.300 --> 11:13.300
But yeah.

11:13.300 --> 11:14.620
So I really enjoyed it.

11:14.620 --> 11:16.620
Loki, what were your thoughts overall?

11:16.620 --> 11:17.620
I thought it was pretty good.

11:17.620 --> 11:21.940
There's I mean, like with most things, I think it did have a lot of stuff in there that

11:21.980 --> 11:26.900
people were looking for and some surprise stuff that I was looking for.

11:26.900 --> 11:30.780
Still a few things missing that, you know, kind of like some updates on, you know, like

11:30.780 --> 11:33.700
being a three prime four and stuff like that.

11:33.700 --> 11:34.700
Yeah.

11:34.700 --> 11:38.260
But I mean, there is a lot of meat there, so it was still pretty good.

11:38.260 --> 11:39.260
Yeah.

11:39.260 --> 11:40.260
So I kind of going through.

11:40.260 --> 11:46.020
Well, but before you get to that, I think I kind of agree with you is that, yeah, overall,

11:46.020 --> 11:47.300
I was very positive on it.

11:47.300 --> 11:51.180
And for me, you know, I kind of have like my wish list, things that if Nintendo would

11:51.220 --> 11:53.740
announced would make me extremely happy.

11:53.740 --> 11:57.940
And I got two things on my wish list this year from Nintendo, and that hardly ever happens.

11:57.940 --> 12:00.500
And let's just I know we want to run down everything that happens.

12:00.500 --> 12:04.220
But I think the obvious things to bring to the table, there's a brand new 2D Metroid

12:04.220 --> 12:05.220
game.

12:05.220 --> 12:06.220
Y'all know that's my jam.

12:06.220 --> 12:10.020
Well, it's kind of new, like I get and I didn't even pick up on this at first.

12:10.020 --> 12:12.420
And like, yeah, because I recognize the name.

12:12.420 --> 12:16.220
So that's been in like development for a while or at least rumored for a while.

12:16.220 --> 12:17.220
Yeah.

12:17.220 --> 12:18.220
Yeah.

12:18.260 --> 12:19.260
Yeah.

12:19.260 --> 12:20.260
Yeah.

12:20.260 --> 12:21.620
The Metroid Dread was originally, I think, going to be the DS.

12:21.620 --> 12:24.660
I think they were developing alongside Fusion.

12:24.660 --> 12:27.620
And it was right at that time, like the advance and the DS were kind of both.

12:27.620 --> 12:31.740
So Fusion came out on the advance and then Dread kind of did it.

12:31.740 --> 12:34.620
And it's like Metroid Other M kind of happened instead.

12:34.620 --> 12:36.660
So we never really got Dread at that time.

12:36.660 --> 12:38.420
And I didn't piece together at first.

12:38.420 --> 12:39.980
Oh, it's that game.

12:39.980 --> 12:43.700
But obviously, you know, here we are like 14 years later.

12:43.700 --> 12:46.740
It's still Metroid Dread and maybe some of the original story ideas are there.

12:46.740 --> 12:49.740
But obviously the game is completely different now that it's on the Switch.

12:49.740 --> 12:50.780
It's not pixels.

12:50.780 --> 12:53.260
It's kind of got a different look to it.

12:53.260 --> 12:54.260
But obviously I'm here.

12:54.260 --> 12:55.700
I'm here with pixels, to be honest.

12:55.700 --> 13:00.860
I mean, I kind of wish it was in the style, like, say, the modern Rayman games and stuff

13:00.860 --> 13:02.940
like that, where it's hand drawn.

13:02.940 --> 13:05.940
That would have been so good, but it's all right.

13:05.940 --> 13:12.500
Yeah, I, I, I would have I would have been thrilled if it was more a pixel looking game,

13:12.500 --> 13:13.500
but I'm OK.

13:13.500 --> 13:15.620
I understand they want to evolve it.

13:15.620 --> 13:17.020
You know, they're pushing it a different direction.

13:17.020 --> 13:20.780
So like even I remember because I was writing out like in my Apple notes as I was watching

13:20.780 --> 13:24.360
it instead of live tweeting, I was kind of like, oh, this is a different look.

13:24.360 --> 13:25.780
It's going to take me some getting used to.

13:25.780 --> 13:26.780
But you know what?

13:26.780 --> 13:28.860
As long as the game's fluid, it's going to be fine.

13:28.860 --> 13:32.220
And I'm just thrilled we get a new Metroid in the series.

13:32.220 --> 13:37.540
Now I'm Tiger Claw in chat over twitch.tv slash VOG Network says this new 2D Metroid

13:37.540 --> 13:41.100
game is supposedly the final one for Samus.

13:41.100 --> 13:46.300
If it sells really well, I'm sure they will find a way to do another one or there must

13:46.300 --> 13:49.740
be some other character they're going to push it off to in the story of the game or so.

13:49.740 --> 13:50.740
I don't know.

13:50.740 --> 13:51.740
Obviously, Metroid Prime four.

13:51.740 --> 13:52.840
We know it's still happening.

13:52.840 --> 13:54.660
So, look, you said they didn't do an update.

13:54.660 --> 13:55.660
They kind of did.

13:55.660 --> 13:56.660
They didn't.

13:56.660 --> 13:57.660
I know what you meant, though.

13:57.660 --> 14:00.300
You wanted to see more footage or like what the hell is this thing look like?

14:00.300 --> 14:04.500
But they did any footage, you know, they did say we're working on it.

14:04.500 --> 14:07.660
We can't talk about it today, but we hope you'll take this instead.

14:07.660 --> 14:10.980
And for me, I'm happy to take that instead this year.

14:10.980 --> 14:16.340
So I'm fine if they need a little more time on Metroid Prime four.

14:16.340 --> 14:17.340
So yeah.

14:17.340 --> 14:21.940
Quest Quest Buster in chat says it's for the Samus Metroid arc, I thought, but not the

14:21.940 --> 14:22.940
end of Samus.

14:22.940 --> 14:27.260
Yeah, I just I just don't see them like actually actually having to be the last Samus game.

14:27.260 --> 14:31.860
They could kill Samus at the end of this game and still not be done with her.

14:31.860 --> 14:34.380
And obviously, I don't know spoilers or story or anything like that.

14:34.380 --> 14:35.820
None of us have played the game yet.

14:35.820 --> 14:39.220
But you know, it's just it's just like the alien franchise in Ripley.

14:39.220 --> 14:40.220
OK.

14:40.460 --> 14:45.580
Kill Samus, but then like she'll come back as a clone or something like that, like she's

14:45.580 --> 14:47.340
not going to be done, done, done.

14:47.340 --> 14:48.340
You know what I mean?

14:48.340 --> 14:49.340
Yeah.

14:49.340 --> 14:51.660
There will be there'll be Samus X like Mega Man will be Samus X.

14:51.660 --> 14:52.660
Right.

14:52.660 --> 14:53.660
Exactly.

14:53.660 --> 14:55.960
So, yeah.

14:55.960 --> 15:00.580
And as Joe and Hunter Matt says, in fact, there are no actual Metroids in this apparently.

15:00.580 --> 15:02.700
I don't know if I believe that.

15:02.700 --> 15:04.580
I know what I know what they're saying.

15:04.580 --> 15:05.580
I know what they're saying.

15:05.580 --> 15:06.580
I don't know if I believe it.

15:06.580 --> 15:10.420
I think it's one of those things where they'll surprise us in the very last level.

15:10.420 --> 15:13.820
But OK, let's let's not set our expectations too high.

15:13.820 --> 15:18.020
But I'm just I'm just really happy to get a new 2D Metroid and see where they go with

15:18.020 --> 15:19.020
it.

15:19.020 --> 15:21.900
But I'm not sure I believe that there's no Metroids in it.

15:21.900 --> 15:22.900
Sorry.

15:22.900 --> 15:26.500
I just kind of like I think you're lying, but we'll see.

15:26.500 --> 15:28.100
We'll see.

15:28.100 --> 15:32.340
And then the other one and Loki, I know you've got to be thrilled with this one, too.

15:32.340 --> 15:35.260
The new WarioWare announcement like that.

15:35.260 --> 15:36.260
That's fantastic.

15:36.260 --> 15:38.620
For all intents and purposes, that really came out of nowhere.

15:38.620 --> 15:42.700
Like, I know there was some rumors about it, but a lot of things were rumored this year

15:42.700 --> 15:47.460
that didn't happen, like a new model for the Switch.

15:47.460 --> 15:51.300
So, you know, obviously, you know, anything can and will happen.

15:51.300 --> 15:54.140
I'm very thrilled that the new WarioWare ended up being a thing.

15:54.140 --> 15:58.900
I think it's interesting that they talked about it being the first WarioWare with co-op

15:58.900 --> 15:59.900
when it's not.

15:59.900 --> 16:02.980
Yeah, I don't think WarioWare.

16:02.980 --> 16:05.500
It's not WarioWare on the GameCube had co-op.

16:05.500 --> 16:08.980
So that was a little maybe they didn't say the first, but they kind of made it sound

16:08.980 --> 16:10.860
like now there's co-op.

16:10.860 --> 16:13.460
And it's like, well, you had that in the GameCube version.

16:13.460 --> 16:21.700
It was, I think, very certain modes and very limited in that game, but it existed before.

16:21.700 --> 16:32.700
I think I think the actual games themselves were not I think they were still for one player,

16:32.700 --> 16:34.020
but you still played them.

16:34.020 --> 16:39.700
I think that's the difference is that in this new one, you actually have games that

16:39.700 --> 16:42.220
are playable with two people at once.

16:42.220 --> 16:44.180
And I don't think the GameCube version had that.

16:44.180 --> 16:45.180
I can't remember.

16:45.180 --> 16:47.740
So, there is that.

16:47.740 --> 16:50.500
Hi, joining us here a little early, but that's OK.

16:50.500 --> 16:51.500
We love to see her.

16:51.500 --> 16:52.500
Hi there, DarkSakura.

16:52.500 --> 16:53.500
I see you just joined us.

16:53.500 --> 16:54.500
Hi.

16:54.500 --> 16:55.500
Yeah, I woke up.

16:55.500 --> 16:56.500
Well, good morning.

16:56.500 --> 16:59.860
I have, I have strain cheese.

16:59.860 --> 17:00.860
Yummy.

17:00.860 --> 17:04.500
Hey, we just talked about the new Metroid and I know you have to have some feelings

17:04.500 --> 17:05.500
on that.

17:05.500 --> 17:08.300
What are your thoughts seeing the Metroid Dread announcement?

17:08.300 --> 17:11.460
Give now.

17:11.460 --> 17:12.460
What do you think?

17:12.460 --> 17:15.180
What do you think about the whole there are no Metroids in this game?

17:15.180 --> 17:19.780
I said that's bull, that they're lying, that they're trying to keep it a secret or something.

17:19.780 --> 17:23.980
I honestly don't care about there being no Metroids in it because I saw Chozo and that

17:23.980 --> 17:25.980
makes me happy.

17:25.980 --> 17:30.340
There are other pieces of Metroid lore for us to be in love with.

17:30.340 --> 17:36.140
I certainly want more of the Chozo in it because, I mean, the only real story that any of us

17:36.140 --> 17:41.260
got for the Chozo is in the manga, as I recall correctly.

17:41.260 --> 17:47.340
If you want to discount like hints in Super Metroid, because I would say they were.

17:47.340 --> 17:48.660
I mean, like real lore.

17:48.660 --> 17:50.560
Yeah, I totally know what you mean.

17:50.560 --> 17:53.860
But like, you know, in Super Metroid, they kind of became more than just the statue.

17:53.860 --> 17:56.140
Like it was very clear there was more to them.

17:56.140 --> 17:57.140
You know what I mean?

17:57.140 --> 17:58.140
So, yeah.

17:58.140 --> 17:59.140
Well, right.

17:59.140 --> 18:00.140
Yeah.

18:00.140 --> 18:06.620
If I recall correctly, I think it came out either before or around Super Metroid.

18:06.620 --> 18:13.440
So I have to look that back up, but I'm glad that we're seeing some of them.

18:13.440 --> 18:17.720
I almost wonder if this is some kind of prequel.

18:17.720 --> 18:21.940
I don't think it's intended to be because you still have Prime serving as the prequels,

18:21.940 --> 18:23.700
I think.

18:23.700 --> 18:26.220
But anything's possible, really.

18:26.220 --> 18:28.740
Like a pre-Metroid story.

18:28.740 --> 18:29.740
Perhaps.

18:29.740 --> 18:32.980
Bobby Black Wolf in chat says they're already making strats based on the trailer.

18:32.980 --> 18:35.540
And I think he's referencing this comment from Tiger Claw.

18:35.540 --> 18:38.940
Can't wait to see speedrunners take on this game and beat it under an hour.

18:38.940 --> 18:39.940
I love that.

18:39.940 --> 18:42.740
They're already strategizing based on the trailer.

18:42.740 --> 18:43.740
Amazing.

18:43.740 --> 18:44.740
So, yeah.

18:44.740 --> 18:45.740
Yeah.

18:45.740 --> 18:47.900
Sacred Jade in chat says, I thought this was a sequel to Fusion.

18:47.900 --> 18:51.260
I think it is supposed to be like Metroid 5.

18:51.260 --> 19:00.320
So if you consider Metroid slash Metroid Zero, Super Metroid, Metroid Fusion, I guess

19:00.320 --> 19:01.900
Other M or am I missing one?

19:01.900 --> 19:03.060
No, of course I'm missing one.

19:03.060 --> 19:04.820
Samus 2 on the Game Boy, Return of Samus.

19:04.820 --> 19:06.340
They don't count Other M. Sorry, I skipped one.

19:06.340 --> 19:11.100
So it's Metroid, Return of Samus, then Super Metroid, then Fusion.

19:11.100 --> 19:12.760
Now this is 5, Metroid.

19:12.760 --> 19:15.660
So Other M has been thrown out of the canon.

19:15.660 --> 19:18.260
So, so much for that.

19:18.260 --> 19:21.040
All right.

19:21.040 --> 19:24.120
One has a few things they're embarrassed about in their history.

19:24.120 --> 19:26.960
I didn't think Other M was as bad as everyone else does.

19:26.960 --> 19:29.580
Like it's, it's definitely different.

19:29.580 --> 19:30.580
She's different.

19:30.580 --> 19:34.480
Like that's, that's, that's my review of Metroid Other M. She's different.

19:34.480 --> 19:41.040
Not as different as Federation Force, but you know, that's what, that's one we'd like

19:41.040 --> 19:42.040
to forget.

19:42.040 --> 19:44.160
Loki, we don't talk about Federation Force.

19:44.160 --> 19:46.680
We just, that, that she, she passed away.

19:46.680 --> 19:50.080
Like we don't talk about that one anymore.

19:50.120 --> 19:52.400
All right, let's see.

19:52.400 --> 19:54.380
So other stuff in the Nintendo Direct.

19:54.380 --> 19:55.840
So we've got Metroid out of the way.

19:55.840 --> 19:57.120
We got Samus out of the way.

19:57.120 --> 19:59.340
Oh, I should mention this.

19:59.340 --> 20:01.280
The Breath of the Wild 2 footage.

20:01.280 --> 20:07.400
So I have been an insufferable bitch on this show saying that if Nintendo doesn't show

20:07.400 --> 20:11.960
Breath of the Wild 2 footage, they're doing the fans a disservice.

20:11.960 --> 20:17.280
And y'all in chat, especially Bobby Blackwell, have been saying no person in the history

20:17.280 --> 20:22.200
of ever has not like pre-ordered or bought the game because they didn't show footage

20:22.200 --> 20:23.200
at a certain event.

20:23.200 --> 20:25.040
And I was like, I don't care.

20:25.040 --> 20:28.440
Your facts are inconvenient and I reject them.

20:28.440 --> 20:34.420
And my point is, is that Nintendo is disrespecting their fans by continuing to not give a Breath

20:34.420 --> 20:35.500
of the Wild 2 update.

20:35.500 --> 20:40.660
They need to give us at least a little something, a little piece, a little taste.

20:40.660 --> 20:45.160
Just lick, let me lick the wall just once, okay?

20:45.160 --> 20:46.920
And I think they did that.

20:46.920 --> 20:50.960
I know some people are kind of disappointed with what little of Breath of the Wild 2 they

20:50.960 --> 20:51.960
showed.

20:51.960 --> 20:55.720
I'm going to actually, I will surprise you all and actually defend it and say that was

20:55.720 --> 20:57.100
what I was talking about.

20:57.100 --> 20:58.100
That was fine.

20:58.100 --> 20:59.100
That was needed.

20:59.100 --> 21:00.600
That was all the update we needed.

21:00.600 --> 21:01.600
We're good.

21:01.600 --> 21:02.600
Yeah, I think it was fine.

21:02.600 --> 21:03.600
It looked great.

21:03.600 --> 21:04.600
Mm-hmm.

21:04.600 --> 21:05.600
So yeah.

21:05.600 --> 21:08.580
Darktitsuyu in chat says, it was a brief tease, but I went away happy.

21:08.580 --> 21:10.960
Can't wait to see what they do with the dual areas.

21:10.960 --> 21:11.960
Absolutely.

21:11.960 --> 21:14.800
Especially, are we getting the upside down castle in Breath of the Wild 2?

21:14.800 --> 21:17.200
Because that's kind of cool.

21:17.200 --> 21:20.160
Questbuster in chat says, I'm pretty excited on seeing what they had for Breath of the

21:20.160 --> 21:21.160
Wild 2.

21:21.160 --> 21:24.520
Did you notice those parallels to Skyward Sword?

21:24.520 --> 21:26.560
I sure did.

21:26.560 --> 21:33.160
Because that whole little blip started with Link falling through the sky just like a scene

21:33.160 --> 21:34.600
in Skyward Sword.

21:34.600 --> 21:40.760
And I'm laughing because I saw the most hilarious edit where somebody took that link flying

21:40.760 --> 21:42.340
through the air thing.

21:42.340 --> 21:46.500
And they photoshopped that instead of wearing pants, he's wearing a jockstrap.

21:46.500 --> 21:49.380
So his ass is hanging out as he's flying through the air.

21:49.380 --> 21:52.560
And I'm sorry, I'm immature and I thought it was really fucking funny.

21:52.560 --> 21:54.620
So there's that.

21:54.620 --> 21:58.060
But the Breath of the Wild footage was fun.

21:58.060 --> 22:01.060
And it was also weird too, the show that, because they showed that like right after

22:01.060 --> 22:04.600
the Skyward Sword HD or remaster thing.

22:04.600 --> 22:07.900
So it was like, these are similar.

22:07.900 --> 22:10.100
I don't know.

22:10.100 --> 22:15.740
The way they set that whole segment up was a little bit of a misstep because they were

22:15.740 --> 22:19.380
like, and here is the last game we have to talk about today.

22:19.380 --> 22:22.380
And it went into Hyrule Warriors DLC.

22:22.380 --> 22:27.580
And I was like sitting there going, fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, and fuck you for doing

22:27.580 --> 22:29.700
the Hyrule Warriors last.

22:29.700 --> 22:33.780
But then it kind of went into, then Anamora showed up and was like, let's talk about Zelda.

22:33.780 --> 22:36.300
And I was like, oh, oh, okay, we're cool.

22:36.820 --> 22:43.060
Oh, you're talking Zelda, the whole part, the whole piece, the whole story is the last

22:43.060 --> 22:44.060
game of the day.

22:44.060 --> 22:45.060
And I calmed down.

22:45.060 --> 22:48.220
And so they did, of course, the Skyward Sword, Breath of the Wild 2, and that little Game

22:48.220 --> 22:50.220
and Watch thing, which is interesting.

22:50.220 --> 22:51.220
It's actually pretty cool.

22:51.220 --> 22:53.020
It has three games on it.

22:53.020 --> 22:54.020
Yeah.

22:54.020 --> 22:55.180
And I like that.

22:55.180 --> 22:57.820
I like that more than the Mario one, I think.

22:57.820 --> 23:02.580
Yeah, I think because the Mario games, how do I say this nicely?

23:02.580 --> 23:05.140
The Mario is kind of played out at this point.

23:05.900 --> 23:09.580
Obviously, Super Mario Brothers is an epic, epic game.

23:09.580 --> 23:14.100
But how many times and how many places do you need the original Super Mario Brothers

23:14.100 --> 23:15.100
to be played?

23:15.100 --> 23:19.380
I feel like there's going to be a version that comes out for refrigerators soon.

23:19.380 --> 23:21.580
That is like how many places that shows up.

23:21.580 --> 23:25.740
But the original Legend of Zelda, and especially like Zelda 2 Adventures of Link, the Game

23:25.740 --> 23:28.200
Boy one too, those are some deeper cuts.

23:28.200 --> 23:31.540
And I think that's nice to see those on the little Game and Watch.

23:31.540 --> 23:35.060
I think the little clock thing looks cute, the way that you can play it.

23:35.060 --> 23:38.700
So I'm more interested in the Zelda one than I was the Mario one.

23:38.700 --> 23:39.700
I will say that.

23:39.700 --> 23:46.340
So what are you going to do when they release the Metroid Game and Watch next year?

23:46.340 --> 23:50.040
Shove it right in my ass, Loki.

23:50.040 --> 23:56.900
I can see them doing like a Metroid, a Metroid, the Game Boy, Metroid Returns, and then just

23:56.900 --> 24:01.780
for the hell of it, maybe throw in Kid Icarus or something like that.

24:02.420 --> 24:06.860
Now you're just like throwing fanboy options out there.

24:06.860 --> 24:08.420
Like yeah right, Kid Icarus.

24:08.420 --> 24:11.140
Like Nintendo's going to acknowledge that franchise again.

24:11.140 --> 24:14.660
First off, Sakurai's going to have to take a nap before we can even think about a new

24:14.660 --> 24:16.020
Kid Icarus game.

24:16.020 --> 24:20.500
And I don't know what's up with that, so yeah.

24:20.500 --> 24:22.060
I would love that though, don't get me wrong.

24:22.060 --> 24:27.120
Like a Metroid Kid Icarus Game and Watch, like a password pack Game and Watch, I'm all

24:27.120 --> 24:28.120
about that.

24:28.120 --> 24:29.120
That would be amazing.

24:29.120 --> 24:30.440
With that silver color.

24:30.440 --> 24:34.000
So alright, anyway.

24:34.000 --> 24:35.640
Bobby says I'm on a butt kick today.

24:35.640 --> 24:36.920
I said two things.

24:36.920 --> 24:37.920
Come on.

24:37.920 --> 24:40.960
What was I supposed to say to that?

24:40.960 --> 24:43.320
Imagine they release your favorite game on a Game and Watch.

24:43.320 --> 24:44.320
What are you going to do?

24:44.320 --> 24:45.320
Of course I'm going to buy it.

24:45.320 --> 24:46.840
If I can get one.

24:46.840 --> 24:47.840
That is.

24:47.840 --> 24:54.360
The funny thing is that I'm in so many other streamers groups that I have plenty of butt

24:54.360 --> 24:59.280
icons to satisfy anybody.

24:59.720 --> 25:03.000
You're very kind and generous with a lot of the Dead by Daylight streamers.

25:03.000 --> 25:05.000
I see you sub to a lot of them.

25:05.000 --> 25:09.100
And a lot of them have some nasty icons, so I don't know.

25:09.100 --> 25:11.200
Some of those I'm like, how did that get through moderation?

25:11.200 --> 25:12.200
So I'm always...

25:12.200 --> 25:14.960
I'm having to be a little bit more judicious with who I sub to.

25:14.960 --> 25:15.960
I understand.

25:15.960 --> 25:16.960
I understand.

25:16.960 --> 25:20.780
It's okay to have an occasional butt show up, you know?

25:20.780 --> 25:22.080
It's just a butt.

25:22.080 --> 25:23.080
Everybody has one.

25:23.080 --> 25:24.080
Gosh.

25:24.080 --> 25:31.080
Anyway, Darsakra, I have to ask you your thoughts on what little we saw, the little tease for

25:31.080 --> 25:34.120
Breath of the Wild 2 and the Zelda stuff.

25:34.120 --> 25:37.200
I'm exactly the same feeling as I was before.

25:37.200 --> 25:39.260
I'm looking forward to it coming out.

25:39.260 --> 25:41.300
This didn't really show me anything else.

25:41.300 --> 25:43.640
Zelda fell down a hole.

25:43.640 --> 25:44.640
We'll see.

25:44.640 --> 25:45.640
All right.

25:45.640 --> 25:48.760
Loki, why don't you walk us through some of the other things that they mentioned with

25:48.760 --> 25:50.000
the Nintendo Direct?

25:50.000 --> 25:56.160
Yeah, so actually kind of going back to the... even though you didn't like it, the Zelda

25:56.160 --> 26:00.080
Hyrule Warriors DLC looked actually pretty cool, where you can actually play as the guardian

26:00.080 --> 26:01.080
stuff.

26:01.080 --> 26:03.960
So my son's excited about that, at least.

26:03.960 --> 26:08.680
Other things that they talked about, they have a new Mario Party Superstars coming out.

26:08.680 --> 26:10.720
That's going to be a collection of the mini games.

26:10.720 --> 26:15.140
I think they did something similar already, but I guess it's now more.

26:15.140 --> 26:16.560
It's like the greatest hits album.

26:16.560 --> 26:18.760
Yeah, but they did that, though, with like the...

26:18.760 --> 26:20.920
It was like Mario Party Gold or something like that.

26:20.920 --> 26:22.720
I thought that came out already.

26:22.720 --> 26:27.560
I think the big thing about this one is that it's all online now, because they finally

26:27.560 --> 26:31.040
figured out that people can play Mario Party online and how to do that.

26:31.040 --> 26:32.720
They figured it out online finally.

26:32.720 --> 26:34.180
That's good.

26:34.180 --> 26:40.120
They talked about the new DLC character for Smash Brothers, which is going to be Kazuya

26:40.120 --> 26:42.620
Mishima from Tekken.

26:42.620 --> 26:43.620
So that's cool.

26:43.620 --> 26:46.200
We got all these fighting games kind of mixed together.

26:46.200 --> 26:48.640
We're almost to Urgites, almost.

26:48.640 --> 26:56.240
Apparently Heihachi is part of the temple level.

26:56.240 --> 26:57.240
What else?

26:57.240 --> 27:01.920
We got confirmation that Guardians of the Galaxy was also coming to the Switch, as well

27:01.920 --> 27:05.800
as some other Switch games that we kind of figured were also coming.

27:05.800 --> 27:14.640
So Two Point Campus, Just Dance 2022, Worms Rumble, Dragon Ball Z, Kakarot, and New Power

27:14.680 --> 27:17.520
Awakens, part one and two.

27:17.520 --> 27:19.160
So that's a long title.

27:19.160 --> 27:24.200
A new Super Monkey Ball, Banana Mania, that's going to be a collection that's coming as

27:24.200 --> 27:25.200
well.

27:25.200 --> 27:31.640
Shimagami Tensei V, and what else?

27:31.640 --> 27:34.400
New collection of Danganronpa games.

27:34.400 --> 27:35.400
What?

27:35.400 --> 27:36.400
Yep.

27:36.400 --> 27:37.400
Yep.

27:37.400 --> 27:44.120
It's Danganronpa Decadence, it's Trigger Happy Havoc, Danganronpa 2, V3, and the new

27:44.600 --> 27:47.600
Danganronpa S Ultimate Summer Camp.

27:47.600 --> 27:48.600
Yay.

27:48.600 --> 27:53.760
We've got a 3D Advance Wars remake, so that was kind of cool.

27:53.760 --> 27:57.920
Oh yeah, that was very unexpected, in my opinion.

27:57.920 --> 28:01.440
I was not expecting an Advance Wars remake, I'm not complaining.

28:01.440 --> 28:06.400
It's not a series I super got into, but I know it is loved, I know people really appreciate

28:06.400 --> 28:07.400
that.

28:07.400 --> 28:09.560
I'm excited to see it.

28:09.560 --> 28:11.280
And then, what else?

28:11.280 --> 28:15.800
Fatal Frame is also coming, it's a Fatal Frame made out of black water.

28:15.800 --> 28:17.760
That was kind of a surprise as well.

28:17.760 --> 28:22.520
So yeah, I think Nintendo had a great direct, I really do.

28:22.520 --> 28:30.440
You know, it wasn't like my face melted off, it was so amazing, but I walked out of it

28:30.440 --> 28:34.880
going okay, I see what games I'm going to be playing this holiday and I'm going to have

28:34.880 --> 28:35.880
fun with it.

28:35.880 --> 28:38.360
And video games should be fun, yay.

28:38.360 --> 28:44.320
So I was above, more than satisfied, we'll say that.

28:44.320 --> 28:47.560
Alright, so there's the Nintendo Direct Recap.

28:47.560 --> 28:52.360
Before we close the book on E3, Loki, am I missing anything else with the show itself

28:52.360 --> 28:56.600
like isn't coming up later in our show or something that needs to be brought up?

28:56.600 --> 29:00.120
I think we touched on everything, but I'm worried I missed something.

29:00.120 --> 29:04.840
If there's something, then I missed it too, because E3 is hard, because there's a ton

29:04.840 --> 29:07.880
of announcements and they're all over the place.

29:08.400 --> 29:11.120
Should we say something about that in television presentation?

29:11.120 --> 29:14.800
I didn't watch it, but I kind of read about it.

29:14.800 --> 29:16.280
I watched it.

29:16.280 --> 29:18.120
I still have a system pre-ordered.

29:18.120 --> 29:21.200
I ordered them when they first came out.

29:21.200 --> 29:24.440
I think the direction the system is taking is interesting.

29:24.440 --> 29:28.240
They're really going to need the games to back it up, and I think they're really going

29:28.240 --> 29:33.160
to need to show solid games that aren't just like, oh, I could do this on my cell phone.

29:33.160 --> 29:36.840
They kind of have that opportunity with like, say, Earthworm Jim.

29:36.920 --> 29:41.560
I think the whole, even though that series has its own issues, but I'm not going to go there.

29:41.560 --> 29:45.720
But the Echo the Dolphin thing was a lot more exciting, not that series itself,

29:45.720 --> 29:47.640
but the creators are making like a new game.

29:48.440 --> 29:52.760
I think that now that's the kind of stuff where I'm like, OK, and television could have

29:52.760 --> 29:57.640
a very interesting niche there if they get some of these like retro developers to come

29:57.640 --> 29:59.560
back and do like a new thing.

30:00.600 --> 30:04.200
I think that could be very because, you know, a lot of retro developers are kind of I think

30:04.200 --> 30:08.040
we were talking a little bit about this with the Ken and Roberta Williams story last week

30:08.040 --> 30:13.160
or the week before was that it's harder to develop a game now with, you know, one person

30:13.160 --> 30:15.480
or a small team than it was back in the day.

30:15.480 --> 30:20.600
But I think in television kind of opens up that possibility again a little bit because

30:20.600 --> 30:21.880
of the rules for its system.

30:21.880 --> 30:24.360
It almost lends itself better to small dev teams.

30:24.360 --> 30:28.040
So I wonder if they're going to attract some of the retro devs a little more often.

30:28.040 --> 30:28.920
I think they could be interesting.

30:28.920 --> 30:33.560
Quest Buster in chat says the Amico presentation was neat.

30:33.560 --> 30:37.480
Tallarico really emphasized that they weren't in competition with the big three.

30:37.480 --> 30:40.120
They just want to be another fun option in addition to those.

30:40.120 --> 30:42.200
And that's absolutely the right path to take.

30:42.840 --> 30:47.880
But gaming, there's so much gaming that is outside just the big three.

30:47.880 --> 30:51.000
I mean, hello, cell phones is huge.

30:51.800 --> 30:56.440
But even now, you know, between arcade one up cabinets and little mini cabinets like

30:56.440 --> 31:00.600
that Street Fighter one that Alan brought me in the middle of the show last week, you

31:00.600 --> 31:05.400
know, there's there's other ways to kind of check games out that aren't just like your

31:05.400 --> 31:06.920
traditional kind of system as well.

31:06.920 --> 31:08.760
Games are baked into TVs now.

31:08.760 --> 31:10.600
You know, it's it's the cloud gaming.

31:10.600 --> 31:11.100
It is.

31:11.960 --> 31:14.440
Gaming is kind of going beyond just the big three.

31:14.440 --> 31:16.840
So I think it's very, very interesting.

31:16.840 --> 31:17.560
SSJ 100.

31:17.560 --> 31:20.600
Matt says put Pixel Poops on Amico, Tommy.

31:20.600 --> 31:25.320
I've been saying to YYR he needs to I think I don't know.

31:25.560 --> 31:28.600
I feel like he might have at least tried to like send an email.

31:28.600 --> 31:34.760
I don't know if the email got anywhere, but I know like I think I think YYR's games, not

31:34.760 --> 31:39.320
just Pixel Poops, but the types of games he develops like super multitasking like Amico

31:39.320 --> 31:40.840
would be such a good platform for that.

31:41.640 --> 31:46.680
So I'd be curious to see like what what's involved with developing for that.

31:46.680 --> 31:50.840
Like I don't know what frameworks and stuff that it's supported on there.

31:50.840 --> 31:55.640
I don't really know what the Intellivision Amico can do and like hardware wise.

31:55.640 --> 31:57.320
So like how do I develop for that?

31:57.320 --> 31:59.160
So I would love information on that, but.

32:00.280 --> 32:02.440
I mean, they have an email address.

32:02.440 --> 32:03.080
That's about it.

32:04.040 --> 32:08.440
Bobby Blackwolf in chat says Pixel Poops wouldn't go on the Amico because of the subject matter.

32:08.440 --> 32:09.720
Other YYR games might.

32:10.360 --> 32:11.480
I have the fix for you.

32:11.480 --> 32:12.440
Here you go.

32:12.440 --> 32:15.560
Because they're little brown piles, you're just going to call them pixel dumps.

32:15.560 --> 32:17.080
And that's what it's pixel dumps.

32:17.080 --> 32:21.560
And you're just going to and you change the taco stand to a pixel store and you're just

32:21.560 --> 32:22.760
dumping pixels on the ground.

32:23.560 --> 32:24.120
That's there.

32:24.120 --> 32:24.600
There you go.

32:25.400 --> 32:28.600
See, I made YYR's game Christian friendly.

32:28.600 --> 32:29.160
How about that?

32:30.360 --> 32:32.600
Pixel pocket says you could make it ice cream.

32:32.600 --> 32:33.480
Oh my God.

32:33.480 --> 32:37.080
It would be like the sweat on Mortal Kombat.

32:37.080 --> 32:42.600
So now my God, instead of little brown piles on the ground, it would just be little pink

32:42.600 --> 32:44.600
piles and it's strawberry ice cream.

32:44.600 --> 32:48.680
And then the little taco cabana turns into ice cream cabana.

32:49.320 --> 32:50.200
There you go.

32:50.200 --> 32:50.700
Done.

32:54.200 --> 32:55.000
Oh my God.

32:55.960 --> 32:57.880
YYR, not to give you more work.

32:59.080 --> 33:01.560
But like Pixel Poops now needs a strawberry code.

33:02.120 --> 33:07.800
Or like if you put down right up left YB, it changes it to strawberry ice cream.

33:07.800 --> 33:13.400
Orange right says people will be searching for the poop code.

33:14.200 --> 33:14.520
All right.

33:14.520 --> 33:16.040
Anyway, let's move on.

33:16.600 --> 33:20.760
But please check it if you if you are newer to Orange Launch Radio and you don't understand

33:20.760 --> 33:22.360
why we're obsessed with Pixel Poops.

33:22.920 --> 33:28.200
It's actually a game that we well, Jamie created and we take credit for.

33:28.920 --> 33:31.720
But Jamie's kind of said this on the show once.

33:31.720 --> 33:35.560
You know, we have this list of dream games that's on our wiki and she threw out that

33:35.560 --> 33:35.960
idea.

33:35.960 --> 33:40.360
And then YYR, one of our listeners slash fav game developers ran with it, actually put

33:40.360 --> 33:42.040
out a game called Pixel Poops.

33:42.040 --> 33:47.640
And then like if that wasn't enough, then Loki was like, hey, I'm going to make a Pixel

33:47.640 --> 33:49.080
Poops game on the NES.

33:49.080 --> 33:52.360
You know, I've always I've been teasing, making a game for literally six years on the

33:52.360 --> 33:52.680
show.

33:52.680 --> 33:57.640
And then he releases Pixel Poops 2 on the NES maker.

33:57.640 --> 33:59.880
And it's available on itch.io and Steam.

34:00.280 --> 34:06.760
Which I do need to update that to the special editions, because there's stuff, you know,

34:06.760 --> 34:12.040
more levels and everything and more characters and other things.

34:12.920 --> 34:18.040
I just haven't quite trying to combine that with uploading YouTube stuff every week or

34:18.040 --> 34:20.600
trying to do it every week is that stuff.

34:20.600 --> 34:24.360
But I still want to do that because I have cartridges and I've got labels now.

34:24.360 --> 34:24.840
I can't wait.

34:24.840 --> 34:26.440
So physical editions.

34:26.440 --> 34:27.560
Yeah, I can't wait.

34:28.040 --> 34:31.160
That's going to be the must have OLR collectors item, that's for sure.

34:31.160 --> 34:36.280
All right, let's move on and get into our gaming weeks and the types of video games

34:36.280 --> 34:40.760
that we have been playing this week, whether it's Pixel Dumps or otherwise.

34:40.760 --> 34:42.520
Dark Sakura, how was your gaming week?

34:45.320 --> 34:47.080
You're muted on hard mute on Discord.

34:49.960 --> 34:50.520
There we go.

34:50.520 --> 34:51.000
There we go.

34:51.000 --> 34:52.040
It was all right.

34:52.040 --> 34:55.800
I played lots of Dead by Daylight.

34:56.360 --> 34:57.640
I played some Pinball.

35:00.040 --> 35:00.760
Wardscapes.

35:01.720 --> 35:02.520
That's it.

35:02.520 --> 35:03.480
No Animal Crossing.

35:04.040 --> 35:05.160
No Animal Crossing?

35:05.880 --> 35:07.240
Two weeks without.

35:07.240 --> 35:08.200
Oh, no.

35:08.200 --> 35:09.400
Is this the beginning of the end?

35:10.120 --> 35:11.080
No, I don't think so.

35:11.080 --> 35:13.000
I just think that I've been really busy.

35:13.640 --> 35:14.200
Understandable.

35:14.200 --> 35:17.800
I'm also surprised, too, like kind of going back to Nintendo Direct, that we didn't hear

35:17.800 --> 35:19.240
any updates on Animal Crossing.

35:20.520 --> 35:21.800
Yeah, it's a little bit surprising, too.

35:21.800 --> 35:24.520
I think like no like version update or something.

35:25.240 --> 35:28.120
Maybe that's coming to like Nintendo Direct or something.

35:28.120 --> 35:29.000
Yeah, yeah.

35:29.000 --> 35:30.680
And also, I didn't watch Treehouse.

35:30.680 --> 35:33.160
They have a lot of stuff, you know, that sometimes they announce in Treehouse.

35:33.160 --> 35:34.200
So maybe it was in there.

35:34.200 --> 35:37.080
I think if they announced something that big, it would have been all over Twitter.

35:37.800 --> 35:40.120
So we've already would have had that.

35:40.120 --> 35:42.760
So I think it's just not.

35:42.760 --> 35:45.880
Yeah, I think if they do anything, it'll be in a separate direct later on or like

35:46.520 --> 35:47.720
they'll do maybe a direct.

35:47.720 --> 35:51.880
I don't want to set expectations unreasonably, but maybe they'll do like in I was gonna say

35:51.880 --> 35:55.080
an indie game direct, but I'm not sure Animal Crossing would fit in with that.

35:55.080 --> 35:59.880
So maybe some type of a mini direct that gives updates on a lot of indies and then an Animal

35:59.880 --> 36:03.880
Crossing surprise thrown in there and maybe maybe one other game that gets DLC or something.

36:03.880 --> 36:05.080
So all right.

36:06.520 --> 36:08.840
Let's let's move on to Loki and your gaming week.

36:10.040 --> 36:12.520
Well, it's been Minecraft still.

36:12.520 --> 36:17.000
So actually, a lot of this week was editing, but still a lot of Minecraft.

36:17.000 --> 36:25.160
And just basically working on designing the structure that I'm building for inspired by

36:25.160 --> 36:27.960
the session I had with Tango Tech last week.

36:27.960 --> 36:32.200
So just kind of working on that, it's going to I decided originally the concept I had

36:32.200 --> 36:35.960
pitched to him when I was doing it was like, OK, we're going to build a skyscraper type

36:35.960 --> 36:40.600
thing, but instead I'm going with like a industrial factory.

36:40.600 --> 36:43.560
So I've been working on that, doing the redstone for that.

36:44.360 --> 36:45.400
So that'll be coming soon.

36:45.400 --> 36:47.240
I tease at the end of my video.

36:47.240 --> 36:49.560
And so that's what I'm working on.

36:50.200 --> 36:51.960
And we had to be continuing to work on this week.

36:51.960 --> 36:56.600
I'm actually taking some time off from work because because it's not work.

36:57.400 --> 37:00.520
So to play some more during the week.

37:00.520 --> 37:01.800
So I'll be doing that.

37:01.800 --> 37:04.440
And I do want to get back into streaming some more as well.

37:04.440 --> 37:10.040
But it's hard to stream when we have cats yelling at us down at their feet.

37:12.600 --> 37:13.100
But yeah.

37:13.960 --> 37:14.460
All right.

37:15.100 --> 37:18.300
My gaming week, I don't really have new games to talk about.

37:18.300 --> 37:21.980
Sadly, I know I was supposed to get on Game Pass to get like Yakuza like a dragon and

37:21.980 --> 37:25.580
some of the other stuff, but our bandwidth is a little tight right at the moment.

37:25.580 --> 37:28.780
And I've just I've just been kind of enjoying the games that I have still.

37:28.780 --> 37:32.060
I've actually been playing No Man's Sky again, which is weird because there's not

37:32.060 --> 37:37.100
another mission, a special timed mission in there right now.

37:37.740 --> 37:41.340
But I want to work on the achievements that I'm missing in that game, because it's really

37:41.340 --> 37:44.220
ridiculous that I talk so much about this game and I don't have all the achievements

37:45.020 --> 37:46.220
So I really need to work on those.

37:46.220 --> 37:47.900
So that's kind of been my goal in No Man's Sky.

37:48.540 --> 37:50.540
I've been continuing in Final Fantasy 14.

37:50.540 --> 37:52.700
In fact, I did at least one stream this week.

37:52.700 --> 37:53.820
There might have been two.

37:53.820 --> 37:57.740
I can't remember anymore, but I know I did one just last night and I've been working

37:57.740 --> 38:01.420
on some of the classes that are not level 80 yet, building them up.

38:01.420 --> 38:04.940
So like my warrior is one of my last jobs.

38:04.940 --> 38:09.180
I have to get to level 80 and I got that to level 51 on stream last night.

38:09.180 --> 38:10.060
So that was pretty cool.

38:11.020 --> 38:13.660
And then continuing in Dead by Daylight a little bit.

38:13.660 --> 38:14.860
I just play a little bit every day.

38:15.660 --> 38:17.660
Shout out to my husband, Alan Alchemy.

38:17.660 --> 38:20.380
He did a stream earlier today for Dead by Daylight.

38:20.380 --> 38:24.620
He did his first cosplay stream where he actually dressed up as one of the characters, Ace.

38:24.620 --> 38:28.220
He bought all this stuff online that he dressed up as the character.

38:28.220 --> 38:30.940
You can check it out on his channel at Alan Alchemy.

38:30.940 --> 38:33.500
I'm pretty sure his VODs are all open and he has clips too.

38:34.060 --> 38:38.380
And I thought that was really adorable that he really poured himself into that.

38:38.380 --> 38:43.580
He actually grew out his facial hair a certain way so he could do the cosplay authentically.

38:44.620 --> 38:46.380
That's pretty awesome.

38:46.380 --> 38:47.020
Yeah, right.

38:47.020 --> 38:51.820
So and I told him you need to go to Dragon Con so you can use some of these cosplays again.

38:52.780 --> 38:58.220
I think Alan may be into the idea of Dragon Con next year.

38:58.220 --> 39:02.220
This year's a little too soon and kind of like this year has been being played.

39:02.220 --> 39:06.060
It's not necessarily the COVID thing, but it's that this year has been being planned

39:06.060 --> 39:07.580
since 2019.

39:07.580 --> 39:09.660
So it's a little hard for Alan to get it on that.

39:09.660 --> 39:11.980
But he's talking about maybe 2022.

39:11.980 --> 39:15.100
He's actually going to come, especially if he sticks with the streaming things.

39:15.100 --> 39:16.300
That would be really exciting, I think.

39:18.060 --> 39:20.540
And then I feel like I'm missing something for my gaming week,

39:20.540 --> 39:23.660
but it's a lot of the stuff I've talked about before on this show.

39:23.660 --> 39:26.140
I didn't really play anything new this week.

39:26.940 --> 39:30.140
Maybe in the next week I'll finally get the Yakuza like a dragon.

39:31.260 --> 39:34.060
Although I'm actually going to be gone for a couple days next weekend.

39:35.580 --> 39:38.940
Not to toot my own horn, but next weekend is my birthday.

39:38.940 --> 39:40.620
So I'm going to be out of town.

39:40.620 --> 39:43.580
I'm going to be getting back just in time for O.L.R. on Sunday.

39:43.580 --> 39:45.260
So it's going to be a rush show next week.

39:45.260 --> 39:46.540
So that'll be fun.

39:46.540 --> 39:47.040
So, yeah.

39:47.660 --> 39:48.540
All right.

39:48.540 --> 39:52.540
Speaking of special show stuff, before I get to the next story,

39:52.540 --> 39:54.460
one thing I want to make sure you all know about,

39:54.460 --> 39:56.060
if you haven't seen on Twitter yet,

39:57.020 --> 40:01.740
Loki Dark Sakura and myself are going to be doing a very special presentation

40:01.740 --> 40:04.460
on Wednesday is the 23rd, right?

40:04.460 --> 40:05.660
If I did my math right.

40:05.660 --> 40:11.020
So Wednesday night at 7 p.m. Pacific, 10 p.m. Eastern,

40:11.020 --> 40:14.540
we are going to be doing a special stream here at VOG Network

40:14.540 --> 40:17.980
where we listen to Orange Lounge Radio episode one.

40:18.620 --> 40:21.340
And not going to lie, it's going to be a little cringe

40:21.340 --> 40:23.820
because we've come a long way in 19 years.

40:23.820 --> 40:27.740
But that's kind of what it's all about is celebrating how far this show has come

40:28.620 --> 40:30.460
in the 19 years that we've been on the air.

40:30.460 --> 40:32.780
So that is a channel point reward.

40:32.780 --> 40:36.220
You guys raised the points for the live folks here at Twitch.tv

40:36.780 --> 40:38.940
and it was our highest channel point reward ever.

40:38.940 --> 40:41.020
And you guys still raised 150,000 points.

40:41.020 --> 40:42.780
So we're going to do that special stream for you guys.

40:42.780 --> 40:47.100
And the Wednesday date is specifically chosen.

40:47.100 --> 40:52.860
It's intentional because June 23rd was the first Orange Lounge Radio.

40:52.860 --> 40:56.780
Obviously, what day falls on what day of the week changes from year to year.

40:56.780 --> 40:59.580
So June 23rd was a Sunday in 2002.

40:59.580 --> 41:00.860
It's going to be a Wednesday this year,

41:00.860 --> 41:03.820
but that will be the actual 19th birthday.

41:03.820 --> 41:05.340
And Dartetsuya in chat says,

41:05.340 --> 41:08.540
Didn't the show originally start at 7?

41:08.540 --> 41:10.380
It started at 6.30.

41:10.380 --> 41:12.060
So I'm glad you brought that up.

41:12.060 --> 41:16.220
Orange Lounge Radio's original time was 6.30 to 8.30.

41:16.220 --> 41:17.740
It was a two-hour show.

41:18.300 --> 41:22.940
And then when we were not able to contain ourselves to two hours,

41:22.940 --> 41:23.980
it was 6 to 9.

41:24.700 --> 41:27.340
So and insert your own joke about 6 and 9 here.

41:28.060 --> 41:30.060
So yeah, it was 6.30 to 8.30 when it first started.

41:30.060 --> 41:32.860
So yeah, that is kind of interesting is that when we listen to the show,

41:33.580 --> 41:35.500
it's only going to be two hours worth of show.

41:35.500 --> 41:38.300
And there were music breaks in the beginning.

41:38.300 --> 41:41.180
So and for obvious reasons, we're not going to play those music breaks.

41:41.180 --> 41:45.820
We're going to kind of use our skip ahead on the music breaks to just get to the talking parts.

41:45.820 --> 41:50.220
So the talking itself may only be about an hour, an hour 15.

41:50.220 --> 41:55.100
I don't remember the ratio of music to talking in the early shows.

41:55.100 --> 41:59.180
So we will cover all that on Wednesday.

41:59.180 --> 42:04.140
I still have to figure out how to play an MP3 so you guys can hear it while I'm broadcasting it.

42:04.140 --> 42:06.300
So I better figure that out before Wednesday.

42:07.660 --> 42:08.160
All right.

42:09.500 --> 42:11.180
Anyhow, one other shout out.

42:11.180 --> 42:13.660
Sorry, I know we won't get into gaming news, but I have some shout outs this week.

42:13.660 --> 42:15.180
I need to make sure I get this one out on air

42:16.060 --> 42:18.860
because you can check it out over on their YouTube channel.

42:18.860 --> 42:24.940
The Dragon Con Digital Media Track did a special kind of spotlight show

42:24.940 --> 42:26.940
that I was lucky enough to be a guest on.

42:27.500 --> 42:30.780
That was a week ago, but you can now watch on YouTube.

42:31.500 --> 42:34.860
You can watch the interview that Mike did with me.

42:35.660 --> 42:39.420
And we just talked about, you know, doing a show for 19 years

42:39.420 --> 42:42.140
and talked a little bit about this upcoming Dragon Con.

42:42.140 --> 42:43.580
And we talked a little bit about, you know,

42:43.580 --> 42:46.780
how has the motivation been there for so long and all that stuff.

42:46.780 --> 42:51.260
So I want to just kind of give that a shout out.

42:51.260 --> 42:55.580
The link is in the VOG Network Discord over at vognetwork.com slash Discord.

42:55.580 --> 42:58.460
Since it's a YouTube link, I can't really read it on air

42:58.460 --> 43:01.020
because, you know, it just has random numbers and letters at the end of it.

43:01.020 --> 43:03.260
But please be on the lookout for that or just check out.

43:03.260 --> 43:06.460
Just do like, you know, Dragon Con Digital Media Rob Roberts.

43:06.460 --> 43:07.900
You'll find it if you do a search there.

43:07.900 --> 43:08.460
So look for that.

43:09.100 --> 43:10.540
And then Bobby is asking me to plug.

43:10.540 --> 43:11.020
Oh, thank you.

43:11.020 --> 43:13.900
I actually linked it there in chat for the live folks.

43:13.900 --> 43:14.140
Thank you.

43:14.140 --> 43:15.340
Thank you for those in the podcast.

43:15.340 --> 43:16.140
Just do a search for it.

43:16.140 --> 43:16.640
You'll find it.

43:18.060 --> 43:19.340
And then Bobby Black Wolf says,

43:19.340 --> 43:22.220
Oh, and plug Summer Games Done Quick Real Quick 2.

43:22.780 --> 43:25.260
Monday early morning and the Saturday night finale.

43:25.740 --> 43:29.100
I don't think I need to plug Summer Games Done Quick because everybody knows about it.

43:29.100 --> 43:31.100
If you don't know about Summer Games Done Quick,

43:31.100 --> 43:33.260
hello, welcome to video game culture.

43:33.260 --> 43:37.100
There is a very big video game event that happens in the summer and in the winter.

43:37.100 --> 43:39.020
And in the winter, it's called Awesome Games Done Quick.

43:39.020 --> 43:41.020
And in the summer, it's called Summer Games Done Quick.

43:41.020 --> 43:44.060
They raise money for charity by doing games quickly.

43:44.060 --> 43:48.620
It's not just a clever title, but the speed running community is awesome.

43:48.620 --> 43:50.860
The commentary they do is great.

43:52.220 --> 43:52.720
Excuse me.

43:53.600 --> 43:59.120
And since it is a charity fundraising thing, there are donations that come in

43:59.120 --> 44:02.880
and somebody has to read those donations and give shout outs live on air.

44:02.880 --> 44:07.840
And one of those many talented somebodies that brings it all together for Summer Games Done Quick

44:07.840 --> 44:10.480
is going to be VOG Network's own Bobby Black Wolf.

44:10.480 --> 44:14.080
And so he will be doing some announcing Monday early, early morning.

44:14.720 --> 44:17.440
Maybe depending on your time zone, it may not be quite the same.

44:17.440 --> 44:21.360
I would say if you're Europe, this is a great chance to catch Bobby Black Wolf

44:21.360 --> 44:23.680
because that'll be middle of the day for you guys.

44:23.680 --> 44:28.960
But he's got a block of games on Monday that I know includes Star Tropics 2, I think.

44:28.960 --> 44:33.040
And I know the original Batman on NES is in there as well and some other games as well.

44:33.040 --> 44:36.960
But then the big, big one that Bobby's doing, we're really thrilled for him.

44:36.960 --> 44:40.640
And, you know, it's just for the speed run in general because it's going to be great.

44:40.640 --> 44:44.400
Bobby's hosting the finale, which is Kingdom Hearts 2 this year.

44:44.400 --> 44:47.840
So he'll be there at the very, very end of it all on Saturday night.

44:47.840 --> 44:49.280
So that is going to be awesome.

44:49.360 --> 44:53.840
So congrats to Bobby and best of luck to everybody at the Summer Games Done Quick.

44:53.840 --> 45:01.600
And I believe that is the 4th of July weekend coming up when that all starts.

45:03.600 --> 45:04.640
Remind me of the date real quick.

45:04.640 --> 45:08.880
I know it's not next week, but I think it's the week after.

45:09.600 --> 45:12.480
So if somebody wants to remind me of the date when that starts.

45:12.480 --> 45:12.800
Thank you.

45:12.800 --> 45:14.720
Bobby says it's July 4th through 11th.

45:14.720 --> 45:15.440
Okay, that's what I thought.

45:15.440 --> 45:17.280
I thought it started the weekend of July 4th.

45:17.280 --> 45:19.520
Okay, so yeah, be looking out for that.

45:19.520 --> 45:20.560
Okay, now we can get the news.

45:20.560 --> 45:21.600
I'm done with all the announcements.

45:21.600 --> 45:22.400
There was a lot tonight.

45:22.400 --> 45:24.960
So that was our own E3 direct right there.

45:24.960 --> 45:25.840
There you go.

45:25.840 --> 45:26.880
All right, let's move on.

45:28.160 --> 45:29.680
Loki, why don't you start us off tonight?

45:30.960 --> 45:31.360
All right.

45:31.920 --> 45:39.840
So starting off, you know, there was some, I guess, issues with the demo for the new

45:39.840 --> 45:43.120
Final Fantasy game that's Strangers in Paradise.

45:43.920 --> 45:52.560
So apparently that there was some issues with game corruption or where there's a gate that

45:52.560 --> 45:54.480
was corrupted or something like that.

45:54.480 --> 46:02.400
So they've, I guess, been able to unable to boot the game and running into different issues

46:02.400 --> 46:05.840
with it, which is not a good way to present your game.

46:05.840 --> 46:06.400
No, it is not.

46:07.600 --> 46:08.320
Even though, yes.

46:09.280 --> 46:13.040
Sorry, I just I need to get on my tangent about bandwidth caps again.

46:13.040 --> 46:15.520
Because people were burning that game download.

46:15.520 --> 46:18.560
And then it's like I wasted my bandwidth for literally nothing.

46:18.560 --> 46:23.440
Now, if I'm not mistaken, you didn't have to re-download the entire thing to fix it.

46:23.440 --> 46:24.880
Am I correct, Bobby?

46:24.880 --> 46:27.600
Because I don't have PS5 still.

46:27.600 --> 46:28.960
Maybe that'll be fixed this holiday.

46:28.960 --> 46:29.920
We'll see.

46:29.920 --> 46:30.880
I don't have PS5 still.

46:30.880 --> 46:31.280
So I don't know.

46:31.280 --> 46:34.880
Did you have to re-download all 11 gigs or did something kind of trigger on the back

46:34.880 --> 46:36.800
end where it just figured it out?

46:39.040 --> 46:41.360
Bobby Blackwell says the patch was not 11 gigs.

46:41.360 --> 46:43.360
OK, so at least they didn't have to re-download everything.

46:43.360 --> 46:44.400
That's good, at least.

46:44.400 --> 46:45.200
But they did it.

46:45.200 --> 46:48.480
They did at least fix it, though, earlier this week.

46:48.480 --> 46:51.040
So that was that was nice that that happened.

46:51.040 --> 46:55.280
But still, like, you know, kind of test that before you publish it.

46:55.280 --> 46:56.640
That's embarrassing.

46:56.640 --> 47:00.000
That's embarrassing for not just Square, but Sony.

47:00.000 --> 47:02.560
And just like the PlayStation 5 is a platform.

47:02.560 --> 47:07.600
Sorry, I'm not trying to be a jerk, but that's a really embarrassing mistake.

47:07.600 --> 47:10.880
Like, how was this not tested?

47:10.880 --> 47:13.280
What this would look like on a retail PS5?

47:13.280 --> 47:16.480
I mean, I'm sure it was tested on dev PS5s.

47:16.480 --> 47:19.120
How was this not tested on a retail PS5?

47:20.400 --> 47:24.640
It's possible, like if there's some sort of corruption with it, maybe that, you know,

47:24.640 --> 47:30.080
copying something or maybe the transfer to like the server or something caused an issue.

47:30.080 --> 47:33.600
And so, you know, maybe it was fine on their end, but then they had the I don't know.

47:34.160 --> 47:35.680
But it is still annoying.

47:36.400 --> 47:38.880
It's it's it's ridiculous how that all went down.

47:39.440 --> 47:43.840
Quest Buster in chat says one could say the demo was fraught with chaos.

47:44.960 --> 47:46.800
Bobby Blackwell says I played it.

47:46.800 --> 47:50.480
They did have an easy mode, but it's a souls like and it kind of proves why Souls games

47:50.480 --> 47:52.640
should not have an easy mode because it's kind of boring.

47:54.080 --> 47:55.840
I got bored and turned it off at some point.

47:55.840 --> 47:56.880
It was just too repetitive.

47:57.600 --> 48:02.240
No one special 77s in chat and says so Squeenix tossed the demo of Phoenix down.

48:02.240 --> 48:04.480
Well, they I think they kind of had to because that's

48:04.480 --> 48:07.200
I mean, it's one thing when your demos bad.

48:07.200 --> 48:10.000
It's another when your demo just straight up done work.

48:11.360 --> 48:15.600
Can you imagine back in the day, Loki, if you'd bought one of those PlayStation magazines

48:15.600 --> 48:19.920
with the demo disk and you put the demo disk in your drive and it just goes corrupt file error?

48:19.920 --> 48:20.420
Sorry.

48:21.680 --> 48:23.280
Yeah, people would be upset.

48:23.280 --> 48:24.800
People would be a little bit upset.

48:24.800 --> 48:28.800
I get that it's different now, but it's I just can't believe that happened.

48:28.800 --> 48:29.760
Or like one of those.

48:29.760 --> 48:33.120
What was it where you got the Final Fantasy seven demo with like, yeah,

48:33.200 --> 48:36.480
Brave Fencer, Masashi, like that file error.

48:36.480 --> 48:36.980
Yes.

48:37.600 --> 48:38.100
Whoops.

48:38.880 --> 48:42.000
That was that's that's really just embarrassing for everyone involved.

48:42.000 --> 48:42.800
I'm sorry.

48:42.800 --> 48:44.320
Anyway, all right.

48:44.320 --> 48:46.160
At some point, I'll get a PlayStation five.

48:47.440 --> 48:50.800
I don't think my birthday I'm going to get one for that, but maybe the holidays.

48:52.400 --> 48:54.560
Anyway, let's move on and talk.

48:55.440 --> 48:56.000
Sorry, guys.

48:56.880 --> 49:01.200
Let's talk a little bit about Niantic, the creators of the game Pokemon Go,

49:01.200 --> 49:03.520
which I've talked a couple times about on this show.

49:03.520 --> 49:05.200
They make other games as well.

49:05.200 --> 49:08.400
Ingress I've talked a little bit about, even though I think that game is kind of lesser known.

49:08.400 --> 49:11.120
But Ingress is that was their first big game and still,

49:11.760 --> 49:14.560
I was going to say is still popular, but that might kind of be a lie.

49:14.560 --> 49:15.760
So is still played.

49:15.760 --> 49:16.560
We'll say that.

49:16.560 --> 49:19.120
It's still popular among the people that still play the game.

49:19.120 --> 49:21.200
Yeah, it's still popular with some people.

49:21.840 --> 49:24.400
And I would say also Harry Potter, Wizards Unite.

49:24.400 --> 49:27.360
I'm not sure how well that game is doing, but I think it's well enough.

49:27.360 --> 49:28.080
It's still going.

49:29.040 --> 49:31.280
I kind of stopped playing that a long time ago,

49:31.280 --> 49:34.160
but I know others that still play it and are into it.

49:34.160 --> 49:35.440
So there's that.

49:35.440 --> 49:37.040
Those are all the Niantic games that are out now.

49:37.680 --> 49:41.920
Niantic has also previously announced they are working on a Settlers of Catan game.

49:42.720 --> 49:43.600
That is still not out.

49:43.600 --> 49:47.360
I think that one's being tested in New Zealand or something, but that game is still not out.

49:48.320 --> 49:52.000
They also announced very recently they are working on a Pikmin game,

49:52.000 --> 49:55.360
or at least some type of exploration with Pikmin type of app.

49:55.360 --> 49:57.760
We're not sure exactly if that means like a game

49:57.760 --> 50:00.560
or maybe something where you're collecting like things from.

50:00.560 --> 50:04.720
We don't know what that is yet, but we know Niantic is doing something with Pikmin.

50:06.160 --> 50:11.120
Well, it was also announced this week Niantic's got another project in the works.

50:11.120 --> 50:15.680
A Transformers game is the next game coming from Niantic.

50:15.680 --> 50:20.880
Now this sounds like it might be a little more when I say is coming from Niantic.

50:20.880 --> 50:24.800
This might be a little more like Niantic and Wizards Unite,

50:24.800 --> 50:29.920
where I actually think Wizards Unite is actively developed by Portkey Games,

50:29.920 --> 50:31.920
which is a subsidiary of Warner Brothers.

50:31.920 --> 50:39.760
They handle all the Harry Potter stuff and they use Niantic's network of AR portals and ARs.

50:39.760 --> 50:44.000
I say portals because they, you know, built that all on the labor of ingress players

50:44.000 --> 50:49.120
and now Pokemon Go players a little bit as well, which is why it got worse, but I digress.

50:49.120 --> 50:53.040
I have to ask because now it's been like a long time.

50:53.040 --> 50:54.720
Yes, an undetermined long time.

50:55.360 --> 50:59.280
So they've finally given you any sort of perks for, you know,

50:59.280 --> 51:01.280
prestige or whatever in ingress.

51:02.880 --> 51:11.040
If you have their $5 a month sub or whatever it is, then you get one set of rewards if you're

51:11.040 --> 51:15.120
unrecursed and you get a slightly better set of rewards if you have recursed.

51:15.120 --> 51:19.040
But that involves you have to have their $5 a month sub to see that.

51:19.840 --> 51:20.400
That's lame.

51:21.120 --> 51:25.120
Yeah, I wish the reward was better for the recursion.

51:25.120 --> 51:27.360
I, you know, that's ingress.

51:27.360 --> 51:28.960
And you know what, though?

51:28.960 --> 51:31.840
You know, as much as I joke about ingress is kind of like, you know,

51:31.840 --> 51:34.720
it's not really at the level it used to be and all that they are.

51:34.720 --> 51:37.840
They have announced they are going to start bringing live events back,

51:38.640 --> 51:42.720
you know, with COVID restrictions, having lessened and vaccines being readily available

51:42.720 --> 51:43.280
if you want it.

51:43.280 --> 51:47.200
And again, we here at OLR would encourage all of you to get your vaccinations.

51:47.200 --> 51:49.360
We've all gotten ours and we're fine.

51:50.240 --> 51:54.960
And yeah, and far less of a chance to spread COVID when we have that.

51:54.960 --> 51:57.920
But anyhow, so they're going to be bringing back live events again.

51:57.920 --> 52:03.200
And I think they're doing a van event in Oakland July 9th.

52:03.200 --> 52:05.280
That's just like a social get together.

52:06.160 --> 52:09.200
But I think they're doing a mission day on July 11th.

52:09.200 --> 52:12.000
And that, again, is kind of like you check in at a spot,

52:12.000 --> 52:15.680
but you're really going outside and exploring the town and doing missions and getting.

52:15.680 --> 52:17.120
So I think there's that.

52:17.120 --> 52:22.800
And then they are saying in-person anomalies or some other type of in-person PVP events,

52:22.800 --> 52:27.200
maybe not necessarily anomaly, but some other type of event is going to be coming back.

52:28.080 --> 52:29.360
It sounds like this year.

52:29.360 --> 52:31.120
So that's kind of exciting as well.

52:31.120 --> 52:32.480
So we'll see.

52:33.200 --> 52:33.520
All right.

52:34.160 --> 52:37.840
Anyway, back to the Transformers game before we got on a tangent there.

52:37.840 --> 52:43.520
I was saying that I think this Transformers game is like the Harry Potter game in that

52:43.600 --> 52:46.160
Niantic is not the one really actively developing it,

52:46.160 --> 52:51.840
but they are lending their AR expertise and their layout of the world to this game.

52:51.840 --> 52:55.360
Because admittedly, it does work better when you have games,

52:55.360 --> 52:57.120
because there's been a lot of Pokemon Go,

52:57.120 --> 53:01.280
like rip off games where it's been randomly generated, so to speak.

53:03.120 --> 53:04.640
And it doesn't usually work out as well.

53:04.640 --> 53:04.960
I don't know.

53:04.960 --> 53:07.840
Some people really love that Jurassic Park game.

53:07.840 --> 53:09.520
Oh, the Transformers game?

53:09.520 --> 53:10.160
Heck yeah.

53:10.160 --> 53:10.720
Heck yeah.

53:10.720 --> 53:11.360
Right.

53:11.360 --> 53:12.960
So Transformers.

53:12.960 --> 53:16.560
Transformers Heavy Metal is supposed to launch globally this year.

53:16.560 --> 53:19.760
They're going to soft launch it in some countries soon.

53:19.760 --> 53:22.000
And I guarantee those some countries are Australia,

53:22.000 --> 53:24.800
New Zealand, because that's where all the Niantic stuff gets piloted.

53:25.680 --> 53:30.560
Seattle-based studio Very Very Spaceship is leading development on this.

53:30.560 --> 53:31.280
So that's why...

53:31.280 --> 53:32.400
I love the name of that studio.

53:32.400 --> 53:33.200
Yeah, I know, right?

53:33.200 --> 53:36.560
That's why I said, I don't think it's actually Niantic,

53:36.560 --> 53:38.320
but there's kind of that going on.

53:38.880 --> 53:39.680
How does this work?

53:39.680 --> 53:41.040
Here's the description.

53:41.040 --> 53:42.640
In Transformers Heavy Metal...

53:43.200 --> 53:46.320
Heavy Metal makes me think of the anime from the 80s, actually.

53:46.320 --> 53:48.160
That's why I'm in Transformers game.

53:48.160 --> 53:48.640
Yeah, right.

53:49.680 --> 53:53.280
In Transformers Heavy Metal, players will join the Guardian Network,

53:53.280 --> 53:58.560
a group of humans who have banded together with the Autobots in a war against the Decepticons.

53:58.560 --> 54:04.240
As a Guardian, players will uncover hidden regions across Earth to find resources and

54:04.240 --> 54:09.120
battle Decepticons in turn-based battles, either solo or with friends.

54:09.120 --> 54:11.920
The only disappointing part about that description is that it

54:11.920 --> 54:16.160
sounds like I will not be able to be a Decepticon or root for the Decepticons.

54:16.960 --> 54:18.560
That is the only unfortunate news.

54:20.400 --> 54:22.320
But okay, I'll still try it.

54:23.600 --> 54:26.960
Pretty much any AR game, and I mean any AR game,

54:26.960 --> 54:30.640
because I've played some fucking trash AR games, Garfield Go.

54:30.640 --> 54:34.160
I've played some really fucking trash AR games.

54:35.120 --> 54:36.560
I'll try it at least once.

54:36.560 --> 54:41.680
Just because I love the concept of real-world location AR games.

54:41.680 --> 54:45.680
I realize AR could also mean hollow lens type stuff,

54:45.680 --> 54:48.960
where literally the environment around you and what you're seeing is different.

54:48.960 --> 54:53.360
And I think Niantic is headed that direction if you look at some of their prototype stuff.

54:53.360 --> 54:55.680
But we're not there yet with these cell phone games.

54:55.680 --> 54:58.160
So it'll be very interesting.

54:58.160 --> 54:59.280
So, all right.

55:01.840 --> 55:03.440
Bobby Blackwell from chat says,

55:03.520 --> 55:07.840
actually, heavy metal wasn't an anime because it was made in the US by Ivan Reitman.

55:08.400 --> 55:10.080
And then I agree with Dark Sakura.

55:10.080 --> 55:12.560
Technically, anime stands for animation,

55:12.560 --> 55:15.920
and US animation is referred to as anime in Japan.

55:15.920 --> 55:16.420
HA!

55:18.080 --> 55:22.960
I mean, there are tons of words that are really just shortened versions.

55:22.960 --> 55:24.880
Like, Terebi is television.

55:26.080 --> 55:27.040
I'm gonna be honest.

55:27.040 --> 55:31.520
I called it an anime because even if it was developed, it kind of looks like an anime to me.

55:31.680 --> 55:34.400
And I realize that's also very different.

55:34.400 --> 55:38.640
So, heavy metal is an interesting movie because back in the day, here we go.

55:39.600 --> 55:41.760
You ready for grandpa to tell a story?

55:41.760 --> 55:45.440
Back in the day, Dark Sakura and Loki, you'll appreciate this,

55:45.440 --> 55:47.440
at the Birdcage Cinemas back in the day.

55:48.800 --> 55:50.480
And then these Sacramento locals.

55:50.480 --> 55:52.320
Back in the day at the Birdcage Cinema,

55:52.320 --> 55:55.040
when we used to do the Rocky Horror Picture Show at midnight,

55:55.760 --> 55:59.520
the midnight movie, the Rocky Horror Picture Show played in theater one.

55:59.520 --> 56:01.360
You know what played in theater two?

56:01.360 --> 56:02.880
Every weekend at midnight?

56:02.880 --> 56:03.600
Heavy metal.

56:04.160 --> 56:08.000
So I know that movie very well from back in the day.

56:09.040 --> 56:10.400
Do you want to know what's funny?

56:10.400 --> 56:11.040
What's funny?

56:12.000 --> 56:15.120
I was sneaked in to see it in 1981.

56:15.120 --> 56:16.640
Oh my god, that's amazing.

56:17.440 --> 56:18.640
I didn't know what was going on.

56:18.640 --> 56:21.200
I think I fell asleep, but I remembered the...

56:22.800 --> 56:25.040
I just remember asking, is that John Candy?

56:27.040 --> 56:28.400
Because he did a voice.

56:28.400 --> 56:31.360
I remember for a short while, for sure, I'd say about a year,

56:31.360 --> 56:34.160
they did Austin Powers Man of Mystery in theater three.

56:35.520 --> 56:40.560
And then I want to say there was another one they tried to do as a midnight movie for a short time,

56:40.560 --> 56:42.400
because it was one of those things where it was like, if we're going to open...

56:43.440 --> 56:46.320
Rocky Horror was the only one that people actually went to, by the way.

56:46.320 --> 56:47.280
Because I remember for...

56:48.240 --> 56:50.160
I remember one night...

56:50.160 --> 56:51.760
Sorry, this has nothing to do with games.

56:51.760 --> 56:52.960
I'm telling the story anyway.

56:52.960 --> 56:57.520
I remember one night, we had such a big theme night going on.

56:57.520 --> 57:00.800
We were running into theater two to fucking change

57:01.440 --> 57:06.640
into one costume to another, because we were out of space in the back part area.

57:06.640 --> 57:07.680
So it was like, you know what?

57:07.680 --> 57:10.560
Once you run up the aisle, just go fucking change in the heavy metal theater.

57:10.560 --> 57:11.280
No one's in there.

57:13.920 --> 57:16.160
Anyway, all right.

57:17.200 --> 57:20.160
I have an aside, by the way, about heavy metal.

57:20.800 --> 57:21.760
Okay, why not?

57:21.760 --> 57:23.200
I get tangents, you get tangents.

57:23.200 --> 57:23.840
What's your aside?

57:24.560 --> 57:26.320
So I used to play Rifts.

57:26.320 --> 57:29.120
It was one of the first tabletop games I ever played.

57:29.120 --> 57:33.120
And our campaign was to find the Lochnar.

57:35.280 --> 57:38.480
And basically, my character was the only one that lived.

57:39.760 --> 57:41.520
I played a true neutral character.

57:41.520 --> 57:47.360
She had an anti-gravity trench coat and was playing Tetris

57:47.360 --> 57:49.680
while the entire party got eaten by ants.

57:49.680 --> 57:52.400
I love that.

57:52.400 --> 57:56.800
And then she delivered the Lochnar to whoever had hired them to get it for a lot of money.

57:56.800 --> 57:58.800
And then that was the last time I ever played Rifts.

57:58.800 --> 58:02.240
Table games really truly only are limited by your imagination.

58:02.240 --> 58:03.360
That's for sure.

58:03.360 --> 58:05.040
By the way, speaking of the birdcage,

58:05.040 --> 58:08.320
while Rocky Horror played in theater one, Heavy Metal would play in theater two,

58:08.320 --> 58:09.520
and Austin Powers in theater three,

58:09.520 --> 58:11.200
do you know what was going on in the parking lot?

58:12.640 --> 58:13.440
Making out.

58:13.440 --> 58:13.940
LARPing.

58:14.880 --> 58:15.380
Well...

58:17.200 --> 58:18.160
I LARPed.

58:18.160 --> 58:19.680
Man, the birdcage being...

58:19.680 --> 58:22.240
That was a fucking cultural icon here in the Sacramento area.

58:22.240 --> 58:24.400
If any of our listeners are in Northern California,

58:24.960 --> 58:26.480
and you're over the age of 30,

58:26.480 --> 58:29.440
you understand all this reminiscing about the birdcage.

58:29.440 --> 58:31.360
That was the place, I'll tell you.

58:31.360 --> 58:32.160
All right.

58:32.160 --> 58:34.000
Yeah, I just know about his second hand.

58:34.000 --> 58:37.680
I mean, I was there when birdcage was torn down, but...

58:37.680 --> 58:41.680
Yeah, you just missed it because they tore it down in, what, 2001?

58:41.680 --> 58:42.880
No, that was the year you got here.

58:43.520 --> 58:44.480
So I think you just missed it.

58:44.480 --> 58:47.600
I was here in 99 because I remember that we watched

58:47.600 --> 58:51.040
X 1999 and End of Evangelion back to back

58:51.040 --> 58:53.760
when it turned to 2000 and was really depressed.

58:55.520 --> 58:56.640
I was here.

58:56.640 --> 58:58.640
The last Rocky Horror at birdcage was 2001.

58:58.640 --> 59:00.400
So you were here, you just probably never got over there.

59:01.040 --> 59:02.320
I was here, yeah.

59:02.320 --> 59:02.820
All right.

59:03.280 --> 59:03.780
Anyway...

59:04.320 --> 59:07.840
Because Dan and I used to go to the game room, like, all the time.

59:07.840 --> 59:09.280
Oh, that arcade was bomb.

59:09.280 --> 59:11.040
Anyway, Bobby Blackwolf in chat says,

59:11.120 --> 59:11.600
See?

59:11.600 --> 59:14.800
Had I not mansplained, we wouldn't have had any of these tangents.

59:14.800 --> 59:16.160
You're welcome, O.L. Army.

59:17.120 --> 59:19.200
What about all the good things mansplaining did?

59:20.000 --> 59:22.320
S.J. 100 Matt says,

59:22.320 --> 59:25.760
We need to bring Travis Donovan in on this memory lane trip.

59:25.760 --> 59:26.800
Absolutely.

59:26.800 --> 59:27.520
Absolutely.

59:27.520 --> 59:29.600
All right, let's move on to our next story.

59:29.600 --> 59:30.640
Did you want to do this dark soccer?

59:30.640 --> 59:31.760
You want me to do this?

59:31.760 --> 59:32.640
You can do it.

59:32.640 --> 59:37.200
Okay, then let's talk about the Epic Game Store and some of the...

59:37.920 --> 59:38.880
I'm sorry, Loki.

59:38.880 --> 59:39.680
Why don't you do this?

59:39.680 --> 59:40.640
I'm sorry, I noticed it was you.

59:40.640 --> 59:41.360
I thought I had this.

59:42.960 --> 59:43.460
Nope.

59:44.080 --> 59:45.520
So there's some...

59:47.360 --> 59:50.240
I don't know if it's leaks or, like, rumors or whatever, but it's...

59:50.240 --> 59:55.760
The database lists Final Fantasy 7 Remake and Alan Wake Remastered

59:55.760 --> 59:59.280
as titles that are going to be possibly coming out.

59:59.280 --> 01:00:02.560
So they're under, like, kind of code names right now.

01:00:02.560 --> 01:00:06.560
But if you look at the database, it actually shows, like, the cloud save folder,

01:00:06.560 --> 01:00:08.560
which then has their actual names.

01:00:08.560 --> 01:00:14.320
So I like these because, you know, Final Fantasy 7 Remake, that's Pineapple QA.

01:00:14.320 --> 01:00:18.640
And then we have Heron staging for Alan Wake Remastered.

01:00:18.640 --> 01:00:20.240
So I guess these are coming.

01:00:21.200 --> 01:00:21.760
Just when?

01:00:22.880 --> 01:00:25.120
I am so here for an Alan Wake Remastered.

01:00:25.120 --> 01:00:26.080
I hope it's true.

01:00:26.080 --> 01:00:28.320
I hope they got to keep the licensed music.

01:00:28.320 --> 01:00:32.320
That's my other big, like, request because it had an amazing soundtrack.

01:00:32.960 --> 01:00:37.280
Like, I'm sorry, I screamed when Pose Haunted actually was in a video game.

01:00:37.280 --> 01:00:38.720
I never thought I'd live to see the day.

01:00:39.600 --> 01:00:41.680
But yeah, and that whole soundtrack was amazing.

01:00:41.680 --> 01:00:44.560
So if they actually got to keep the licensed music and they're doing a remaster,

01:00:44.560 --> 01:00:45.520
I'm so here for it.

01:00:46.080 --> 01:00:46.720
Let's hope so.

01:00:47.680 --> 01:00:54.480
Yeah, I'm curious to see what abominations we're going to get with Final Fantasy 7

01:00:54.480 --> 01:00:59.040
Remastered coming to PC, and then the modding community hits it.

01:00:59.040 --> 01:00:59.680
Oh boy!

01:01:00.240 --> 01:01:01.760
That's going to be interesting!

01:01:01.760 --> 01:01:02.720
Can't wait!

01:01:02.720 --> 01:01:03.840
It's going to be a lot of fun.

01:01:03.840 --> 01:01:04.340
All right.

01:01:05.300 --> 01:01:07.700
Anyhow, let's move on and talk about...

01:01:07.700 --> 01:01:10.020
Hey, let's talk about the things people are already making.

01:01:10.660 --> 01:01:15.060
A game that encourages making your own games.

01:01:15.060 --> 01:01:17.460
Game Builder Garage came out for the Nintendo Switch.

01:01:17.460 --> 01:01:19.700
That was another one of those things I meant to get around to this week.

01:01:19.700 --> 01:01:22.820
And, you know, just didn't get the time.

01:01:22.820 --> 01:01:27.220
And we were kind of wondering, like, how long before people build copyright

01:01:27.220 --> 01:01:29.460
questionable things in Game Builder Garage?

01:01:30.100 --> 01:01:31.620
And it was kind of like, well, it maybe...

01:01:31.940 --> 01:01:36.500
It seems like it might be too limited to do that kind of stuff.

01:01:36.500 --> 01:01:39.060
Like it's not Dreams, you know, on the PS4.

01:01:39.060 --> 01:01:41.780
Like Game Builder Garage is still a little limited in what you can do.

01:01:41.780 --> 01:01:44.500
So we weren't sure if there would be a lot, but as it turns out,

01:01:45.220 --> 01:01:48.820
no, people are able to make some pretty neat knockoffs in there.

01:01:48.820 --> 01:01:56.420
So apparently some Twitter users actually made the 1996 O'Green of Time prototype.

01:01:56.420 --> 01:01:57.540
That's amazing.

01:01:57.540 --> 01:02:02.500
And a user named Zelda Boy on Twitter made the original SNES Mario Kart.

01:02:03.380 --> 01:02:05.940
Apparently recreated that in Game Builder Garage.

01:02:05.940 --> 01:02:11.460
Now it looks like I'm looking at the screenshot of it and it doesn't totally look right.

01:02:11.460 --> 01:02:16.980
But still the idea that somebody kind of made it and it kind of works is pretty neat.

01:02:16.980 --> 01:02:22.100
Anyway, if you want to look up this user on Twitter, their name is Zelda Boy,

01:02:22.100 --> 01:02:23.860
but that's B-O-I and then one.

01:02:24.660 --> 01:02:28.340
You can see they put the game ID there if you want to check out that game

01:02:28.340 --> 01:02:29.860
and with all the controls there.

01:02:29.860 --> 01:02:31.460
So I think that's pretty cool.

01:02:31.460 --> 01:02:35.220
And yeah, the O'Green of Time prototype link doesn't exactly look right,

01:02:35.220 --> 01:02:39.460
but still, I mean, the fact that people are going this far with it is pretty cool.

01:02:40.260 --> 01:02:43.460
Yeah, I haven't played Game Builder Garage yet, but my son's still going through it.

01:02:43.460 --> 01:02:45.940
He played through like several different tutorials.

01:02:45.940 --> 01:02:48.820
So he's been having me play his games that he's been making with it.

01:02:48.820 --> 01:02:52.980
So there's one that he did where it's like a two-player game where you have...

01:02:52.980 --> 01:02:55.220
It's like tag, so you have to get away from the one person

01:02:55.220 --> 01:02:57.860
and dodge like these balls that are falling down.

01:02:57.860 --> 01:03:02.820
And then there was another one he did that was kind of like one of those labyrinth mazes

01:03:02.820 --> 01:03:05.060
where you tilt the marble around.

01:03:05.060 --> 01:03:08.980
So he uses the motion controls to control that one.

01:03:08.980 --> 01:03:09.620
So that's cool.

01:03:10.420 --> 01:03:11.140
He's enjoying it.

01:03:11.780 --> 01:03:12.340
All right.

01:03:12.340 --> 01:03:13.460
Yeah, I want to check that out.

01:03:13.460 --> 01:03:15.300
We haven't put Pixel Poops 2 on it yet, so, you know.

01:03:16.340 --> 01:03:17.700
By the way, one other...

01:03:17.700 --> 01:03:20.340
There's an Intend Dogs prototype that somebody made as well.

01:03:20.420 --> 01:03:22.180
Japanese user made that.

01:03:22.180 --> 01:03:23.940
So that's pretty cool.

01:03:23.940 --> 01:03:26.660
So anyway, I definitely have to check out the Game Builder Garage.

01:03:26.660 --> 01:03:28.900
For nothing else, I just want to play other people's games.

01:03:28.900 --> 01:03:30.820
People are very creative.

01:03:30.820 --> 01:03:32.180
It's not a full-price game either.

01:03:32.180 --> 01:03:34.580
I think it's $30 or $40.

01:03:34.580 --> 01:03:35.860
Oh, that's even better.

01:03:35.860 --> 01:03:37.860
Yeah, so it's definitely worth checking out.

01:03:37.860 --> 01:03:38.580
Absolutely.

01:03:38.580 --> 01:03:39.300
All right, moving on.

01:03:39.300 --> 01:03:39.800
Loki.

01:03:41.220 --> 01:03:48.580
All right, so Cyberpunk 2077 has been littered with bugs and problems.

01:03:48.580 --> 01:03:53.860
And you may remember last year they had pulled it from the PlayStation Store because it was so broken.

01:03:54.420 --> 01:03:56.420
Well, it's finally coming back.

01:03:57.140 --> 01:04:02.820
So you can actually now check it out for the PlayStation 4 now.

01:04:03.460 --> 01:04:04.820
I don't think they have a dedicated PlayStation...

01:04:04.820 --> 01:04:08.340
Well, yeah, obviously they don't have a dedicated PlayStation 5 or Series X version yet.

01:04:08.340 --> 01:04:11.380
But it's coming.

01:04:12.020 --> 01:04:13.940
So the wait...

01:04:13.940 --> 01:04:17.380
I don't even know what the timeline was because I know that was supposed to be March originally.

01:04:17.380 --> 01:04:18.340
And then they pushed it back.

01:04:18.340 --> 01:04:24.020
I don't know if that's still August or something, but I haven't played it in a while.

01:04:24.020 --> 01:04:30.020
It's been probably six months since I played that game because I've been just waiting for it to be fully patched.

01:04:30.020 --> 01:04:31.300
Yeah, I don't blame you.

01:04:32.340 --> 01:04:35.700
But that's great that they can actually get the sales from PlayStation now.

01:04:35.700 --> 01:04:41.380
Although, you know, based on other stories, it doesn't sound like the game got hurt as bad as we thought it would.

01:04:41.380 --> 01:04:43.300
I mean, yes, they had to do some refunds.

01:04:43.300 --> 01:04:44.260
They did quite a few of those.

01:04:44.260 --> 01:04:48.900
But it sounded to me like the game was still, for all intents and purposes, successful.

01:04:51.060 --> 01:04:56.500
Despite all these, you know, launch horror stories and the fact that I got pulled from the PlayStation shop.

01:04:56.500 --> 01:04:58.820
And now that's just, you know, more money for them to bring in.

01:04:58.820 --> 01:05:01.460
They probably won't put this game on sale for quite some time.

01:05:01.460 --> 01:05:06.660
I would imagine this holiday will start to see some sales on this game, which is about the time I'll start to look at it.

01:05:07.380 --> 01:05:12.820
But, you know, because like Loki's kind of also saying there, when it gets the patches and all that stuff, I might be more into it.

01:05:12.820 --> 01:05:14.980
It's going to be a great game once it gets the patches.

01:05:14.980 --> 01:05:19.620
It's just, you know, it had a lot of promise, like with the concept for it.

01:05:19.620 --> 01:05:21.780
But they just kind of cut a lot of corners.

01:05:21.780 --> 01:05:36.980
So if they're able to kind of pull, I mean, it's hard to say if they pull a no man's sky and just completely bring, you know, if they at least like kind of meet us a little bit halfway there or something, you know, with like fixing, especially like the police AI, which I know was on the list of things to do.

01:05:36.980 --> 01:05:51.700
So it's not so cheap, or if like I'm starting, you know, to get my crime level up or whatever, I don't have police officers teleporting right behind you, I'm sitting on the ledge of a building, you know, like ridiculous stuff like that, like, then that would be fine.

01:05:53.700 --> 01:05:55.220
I don't know, I'll go back to it eventually.

01:05:55.220 --> 01:05:57.140
But it was it was a pretty good game.

01:05:57.140 --> 01:05:58.980
It's just a pretty buggy game.

01:05:58.980 --> 01:06:01.300
Some more comments on Cyberpunk in our chat room.

01:06:01.940 --> 01:06:05.860
Quest Buster says the biggest damage was to CD Projekt's reputation.

01:06:05.860 --> 01:06:08.660
But from their fiscal reports, they made bank on the game.

01:06:08.660 --> 01:06:12.500
And Bobby Blackwell says CP 2077 was still a financial success.

01:06:12.500 --> 01:06:21.460
And I think it really does go a long way to underscore the fact that, you know, internet rage on Twitter, Facebook and all that stuff.

01:06:21.460 --> 01:06:23.140
It doesn't mean shit.

01:06:24.500 --> 01:06:27.540
What really matters is if you buy the game or not.

01:06:27.540 --> 01:06:36.020
And if you give the money or not, it really matters what's coming out of your wallet or staying in your wallet at the end of the day, if you're complaining about it on Twitter and then buy the game anyway.

01:06:36.020 --> 01:06:37.060
Congrats, you did nothing.

01:06:37.700 --> 01:06:45.940
So I mean, you know, and sometimes I mean, with the Cyberpunk stuff, I that's one of those ones where I kind of understand why people were pissed off with that.

01:06:45.940 --> 01:06:51.460
But there's other things where I'm always like, you know, why are people they're going to buy the game anyway?

01:06:51.460 --> 01:06:55.940
Why are people complaining about if they show a Breath of the Wild 2 trailer at E3 or not?

01:06:55.940 --> 01:06:56.340
Shut up.

01:06:56.340 --> 01:06:57.620
You're going to buy the game anyway.

01:06:57.620 --> 01:06:58.580
And, you know, tea.

01:07:01.140 --> 01:07:03.540
All right, let's move on.

01:07:04.820 --> 01:07:22.820
Let's talk about the Xbox Series X and S, because, you know, they've talked about how the X and S titles are, you know, they still want to support the Xbox One, even though they want to make games that are really only technically possible on the Xbox X and S.

01:07:22.820 --> 01:07:24.420
So what happens to Xbox One?

01:07:24.420 --> 01:07:37.300
And I remember suggesting on a prior episode, and I'm sure I'm not the only one to do this, that, well, if Microsoft's getting into this cloud thing, then why would the Xbox One at some point not just become the way you play games on the cloud?

01:07:37.300 --> 01:07:38.180
Well, guess what?

01:07:38.740 --> 01:07:39.380
Guess what?

01:07:40.020 --> 01:07:42.980
It looks like that is actually the direction that Microsoft is going.

01:07:43.940 --> 01:08:01.780
Will Tuttle from Microsoft kind of confirmed in a Xbox news post at news.xbox.com that Xbox One owners will get to play many, so they don't want to commit to all, but many Xbox Series X and S titles through cloud gaming.

01:08:01.780 --> 01:08:06.900
We don't know what the details look like yet, but I guess in the future we'll know more about how this works.

01:08:06.900 --> 01:08:12.100
And we kind of, you know, we have an idea through some of these test programs and stuff what that might look like.

01:08:12.100 --> 01:08:20.820
You know, and again, this, I, you know, even though it's been speculation, they've kind of hinted this is where it's been going before.

01:08:20.820 --> 01:08:24.820
Phil Spencer had mentioned in an interview that he did with Kotaku in October.

01:08:24.820 --> 01:08:31.300
Game streaming could help bridge generations and let Xbox One users play the latest titles.

01:08:31.300 --> 01:08:35.780
My big shock is that they wouldn't put a cloud gaming player on Xbox 360.

01:08:36.500 --> 01:08:36.980
Why not?

01:08:37.700 --> 01:08:41.620
Maybe, maybe it isn't, I don't, how could, how can...

01:08:41.620 --> 01:08:42.740
Maybe it can't handle that.

01:08:42.740 --> 01:08:45.220
Maybe it really can't, or maybe the, are the controllers too different?

01:08:45.220 --> 01:08:45.460
Maybe?

01:08:45.460 --> 01:08:51.300
I don't know, but I, I would just, I would just be surprised they wouldn't even put a cloud gaming player on the Xbox 360.

01:08:51.300 --> 01:08:52.580
They might though.

01:08:52.580 --> 01:08:54.260
I don't rule it out.

01:08:55.460 --> 01:09:02.660
But maybe they're also thinking there's not quite the, you know, Xbox 360s are starting to kind of like stop working and stuff like that.

01:09:02.660 --> 01:09:04.900
So maybe they don't think they'd get the game for the buck.

01:09:05.460 --> 01:09:14.900
And I, I don't think that like, because that's a couple generations back, like I get it that, you know, they probably still want you to at least upgrade.

01:09:14.900 --> 01:09:22.660
And my concern I think with the Xbox 360 would be storage because the hard drives on those weren't very large.

01:09:22.660 --> 01:09:23.060
True.

01:09:23.060 --> 01:09:28.500
And so to be able to, you know, store or cache, you know, I guess with game streaming it's not a big deal.

01:09:28.500 --> 01:09:36.100
But like, I think maybe they just want you to upgrade to the, at least the Xbox One to be able to run that stuff.

01:09:36.100 --> 01:09:39.620
Because maybe those processors are just really old and maybe storage is an issue with those.

01:09:39.620 --> 01:09:44.420
But they probably also just want to sell at least some of those consoles.

01:09:44.420 --> 01:09:46.020
At the very least, like, you know, the last gen.

01:09:46.020 --> 01:09:53.140
And I mean, even now, I don't know what like an original Xbox One goes for, but like, I can't imagine it's super expensive at this point.

01:09:53.140 --> 01:09:54.020
Not at this point.

01:09:54.020 --> 01:09:56.180
I want to get to this comment in chat.

01:09:56.180 --> 01:09:59.300
Ninja The Monkey in chat says, well, look at the Game Pass.

01:09:59.300 --> 01:10:03.700
Most of the newer editions are for X and S, but you can still play it on the One.

01:10:03.700 --> 01:10:04.180
Yes.

01:10:04.180 --> 01:10:11.220
And Microsoft kind of promised that in the beginning is that we're going to still be developing titles that are playable on both.

01:10:11.220 --> 01:10:13.300
Like Halo Infinite is playable on both.

01:10:13.300 --> 01:10:15.300
And this has nothing to do with cloud gaming.

01:10:15.300 --> 01:10:21.300
This is just the whole, like, you know, a modern PC will play it super well at these settings.

01:10:21.300 --> 01:10:24.900
But on an older PC, it'll look less great, right?

01:10:24.900 --> 01:10:26.660
The frame rate might not be quite as smooth.

01:10:26.660 --> 01:10:29.940
You might have the same draw distance and all that stuff, but you'll still be able to play the game.

01:10:30.500 --> 01:10:33.860
Honestly, same deal with PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4, right?

01:10:33.860 --> 01:10:36.020
Like they announced Horizon Forbidden West.

01:10:36.020 --> 01:10:38.020
It's going to be on PlayStation 5, but guess what?

01:10:38.020 --> 01:10:39.540
They're also going to put it on PlayStation 4.

01:10:40.900 --> 01:10:52.340
But I think what we're looking ahead to is that Microsoft may not want to keep developing that way through the entire lifespan of the series X and S.

01:10:52.340 --> 01:11:02.020
There's going to come a point where this game and this vision that we have, this Forza Motorsport 8, I think is the game that's breaking it, to be perfectly frank.

01:11:03.060 --> 01:11:05.220
This game won't play on the One.

01:11:05.220 --> 01:11:07.140
It is too powerful.

01:11:07.140 --> 01:11:09.380
It needs a series X and S.

01:11:09.380 --> 01:11:17.300
And I, you know, I say that very specifically because they were demoing Forza Motorsport in the early days of the Xbox Series X.

01:11:17.300 --> 01:11:19.060
We're getting Horizon instead.

01:11:19.060 --> 01:11:22.260
Motorsport has mysteriously disappeared and been delayed.

01:11:22.260 --> 01:11:26.180
And I think it's because that is the game they cannot get working on the Xbox One.

01:11:26.180 --> 01:11:31.380
And so they have decided, fuck it, we're going to delay it until we no longer need to put it out on the Xbox One.

01:11:31.380 --> 01:11:41.380
And our cloud gaming system is in place that will now allow you to do Forza Motorsport 8 or whatever it is on the Xbox One through the magic of cloud gaming.

01:11:41.380 --> 01:11:43.380
So that's that's my guess.

01:11:44.340 --> 01:11:47.700
Anyway, Bobby Blackwolf also, oh, this is OK.

01:11:47.700 --> 01:11:50.260
Now, this is a really good theory about the 360.

01:11:50.260 --> 01:11:57.300
The Xbox 360's Ethernet port is only a well, he actually corrects it and says, OK, it is a 100 megabyte port.

01:11:57.300 --> 01:11:59.940
I think that it's not a gigabit port.

01:11:59.940 --> 01:12:03.060
That's why it has a different color in my router.

01:12:03.060 --> 01:12:05.460
OK, that that makes no sense.

01:12:05.460 --> 01:12:06.260
Gigabit port.

01:12:06.260 --> 01:12:09.540
Yeah, that makes sense then that it's just not fast enough.

01:12:09.540 --> 01:12:11.620
The parts inside to handle cloud stuff.

01:12:11.620 --> 01:12:12.020
All right.

01:12:12.020 --> 01:12:12.420
I got you.

01:12:12.420 --> 01:12:12.900
I got you.

01:12:13.700 --> 01:12:16.500
Yeah, it can work for Netflix, but maybe not X cloud.

01:12:16.500 --> 01:12:16.980
I get it.

01:12:16.980 --> 01:12:17.620
I get it.

01:12:17.620 --> 01:12:17.940
All right.

01:12:17.940 --> 01:12:18.660
Anyway, good.

01:12:19.300 --> 01:12:19.780
All right.

01:12:19.780 --> 01:12:20.500
Well, OK.

01:12:20.500 --> 01:12:22.820
I think we've talked about the cloud.

01:12:22.820 --> 01:12:26.020
I think it's time to go back and talk about something a little retro.

01:12:38.820 --> 01:12:43.220
Time to travel back to a simpler time or I'll dive into the vault.

01:12:43.220 --> 01:12:45.940
And pull out a classic and tell you about it.

01:12:45.940 --> 01:12:48.580
It's time for the classic game of the week.

01:12:50.740 --> 01:12:52.580
And what did you pick this week, Dark Sakura?

01:12:53.540 --> 01:12:57.460
I picked a kind of fan game.

01:12:59.140 --> 01:13:01.380
It was a freeware role playing game.

01:13:02.500 --> 01:13:09.460
And it was presented as an official sequel to Barkley Shut Up and Jam and Space Jam.

01:13:10.260 --> 01:13:12.980
And it's called Barkley Shut Up and Jam Gaiden.

01:13:13.220 --> 01:13:15.300
And it's weird.

01:13:16.980 --> 01:13:23.220
If I was doing a weird home game of the month, this one would be on it.

01:13:23.220 --> 01:13:25.620
We have this in my background not too long ago.

01:13:26.900 --> 01:13:27.220
Yeah.

01:13:29.620 --> 01:13:37.140
So anyway, you basically are playing as Charles Barkley and a few secondary characters.

01:13:39.380 --> 01:13:41.860
It's it's interesting.

01:13:41.860 --> 01:13:51.620
So basically, it has a play system called, I guess it would be pronounced BABY,

01:13:51.620 --> 01:13:53.140
but it's B-A-B-B-Y.

01:13:53.140 --> 01:14:01.220
BABY maybe system that the battle system was influenced by a lot of the JRPGs.

01:14:01.220 --> 01:14:07.380
So the enemies will appear on the game field and run at your player.

01:14:07.380 --> 01:14:10.980
And they will attack you if you move into their line of sight.

01:14:11.060 --> 01:14:14.820
And then you have a battle and you have attacks and skills.

01:14:14.820 --> 01:14:21.780
And basically, you also do have timed button presses like in the Mario RPG series.

01:14:22.980 --> 01:14:24.820
And some are accuracy based.

01:14:24.820 --> 01:14:26.740
So, I mean, it's your general game.

01:14:27.620 --> 01:14:29.700
Apart from that weirdness.

01:14:31.300 --> 01:14:39.300
So you're playing in 2041, 12 years prior to the main part of the game

01:14:39.300 --> 01:14:43.060
in this post cyber-apocalyptic Neo New York.

01:14:44.580 --> 01:14:48.660
Where Charles Barkley does a chaos dunk at a baseball game

01:14:48.660 --> 01:14:51.860
and inadvertently kills with the people who are there.

01:14:51.860 --> 01:14:56.260
So basketball gets outlawed and basketball players are hunted down and killed.

01:14:57.860 --> 01:15:01.380
So basically, that's the beginning premise.

01:15:02.580 --> 01:15:07.620
Someone else does another chaos dunk later and Charles Barkley is blamed for it.

01:15:07.620 --> 01:15:13.220
And so there is a hunt by the b-ball removal department led by Michael Jordan.

01:15:14.340 --> 01:15:22.020
And I'm going to leave it there because it apparently goes really, really weird.

01:15:23.220 --> 01:15:28.180
So like, I mean, it's got a very involved story,

01:15:28.180 --> 01:15:35.700
but the whole thing is that it came apart as a sort of joke based on

01:15:35.700 --> 01:15:39.460
an awkward phrase on Michael Jordan's Wikipedia page.

01:15:40.660 --> 01:15:43.780
So it was developed by Tales of Games Studios.

01:15:45.540 --> 01:15:48.980
They were members from Amateur Game Development Forum.

01:15:49.620 --> 01:15:52.260
And that phrase was about whether,

01:15:52.980 --> 01:15:57.300
it was about the fan debate over whether or not Space Jam was canon

01:15:57.300 --> 01:16:01.060
without specifying if it was talking about the Looney Tunes series

01:16:01.060 --> 01:16:03.140
or Michael Jordan's life in general.

01:16:03.780 --> 01:16:11.060
So some of the members, and I'll give the names, was Chef Boyardee, Bort, Jeezy.

01:16:11.060 --> 01:16:14.660
When I hear Bort, all I think is the Blort, which is what I call the blight.

01:16:15.780 --> 01:16:21.460
And QuackGyver all had some work in developing the game.

01:16:21.460 --> 01:16:24.180
And there were a few other minor contributions.

01:16:24.900 --> 01:16:31.220
And it was first developed in RPG Maker 2003 and ported to Game Maker 6.1.

01:16:31.460 --> 01:16:35.860
It was planned to be released for both, but eventually only came out

01:16:35.860 --> 01:16:39.220
through Game Maker 6.1 because of power and flexibility.

01:16:40.100 --> 01:16:42.340
And it also was,

01:16:46.980 --> 01:16:52.340
at the 2014 Games Done Quick, the guys behind it said they never played

01:16:52.340 --> 01:16:54.580
the original Shut Up and Jam.

01:16:54.580 --> 01:16:56.100
Sorry, I can't make words today.

01:16:56.180 --> 01:17:00.180
But they said that the thought of that RPG would make them laugh,

01:17:00.180 --> 01:17:01.060
and that's why they did it.

01:17:02.020 --> 01:17:07.540
So, Tales of Games in 2012 announced a sequel called

01:17:07.540 --> 01:17:12.180
The Magical Realms of Ternanog Escape from Necron 7,

01:17:12.180 --> 01:17:15.220
Revenge of Cocolon, the official game of the movie,

01:17:15.220 --> 01:17:17.860
Chapter 2 of the Hoops Barclay Saga.

01:17:17.860 --> 01:17:18.980
That's the full name.

01:17:19.860 --> 01:17:22.260
Had crowdfunding on Kickstarter to start it.

01:17:22.500 --> 01:17:36.500
It ended, the Kickstarter ended on December 28th and raised $120,335.

01:17:39.620 --> 01:17:44.740
And they were doing everything from scratch to avoid copyright issues.

01:17:46.420 --> 01:17:49.220
But the majority of the developers left the project,

01:17:50.180 --> 01:17:54.580
and that development is going slowly because only two people are behind it right now,

01:17:54.580 --> 01:17:56.740
and there's some very poor management going on.

01:17:57.300 --> 01:17:59.140
So we'll see if it actually happens.

01:18:00.340 --> 01:18:05.700
But yeah, as far as release dates, this came out January 22nd, 2008,

01:18:05.700 --> 01:18:08.900
which means it's permitted.

01:18:10.180 --> 01:18:14.580
And it was released on Windows and Mac OS X.

01:18:14.580 --> 01:18:18.500
And that's it.

01:18:19.700 --> 01:18:20.180
All right.

01:18:20.900 --> 01:18:22.100
It's weird, isn't it?

01:18:22.100 --> 01:18:24.340
It is very weird, that is for sure.

01:18:26.340 --> 01:18:28.420
Yeah, I'm reading some of the comments.

01:18:28.420 --> 01:18:31.140
I just think it's funny that he's talking to Larry Bird in there,

01:18:31.140 --> 01:18:32.420
who's wearing a fedora.

01:18:32.420 --> 01:18:32.920
Oh, yeah.

01:18:34.740 --> 01:18:36.260
I'm reading some of the comments in chat.

01:18:36.260 --> 01:18:39.300
I guess this is actually a very timely sort of pick.

01:18:39.300 --> 01:18:41.860
I didn't realize this because, well, for what they're all saying,

01:18:41.860 --> 01:18:43.620
like, this game's 10 years old, what?

01:18:43.700 --> 01:18:47.220
But apparently, and I know this, Questbuster says

01:18:47.220 --> 01:18:52.900
they even had a widely successful Kickstarter for a sequel that never materialized.

01:18:52.900 --> 01:18:57.060
And Bobby says they literally canceled it two weeks ago and released all the code.

01:18:57.060 --> 01:18:58.500
Is that not what I just said?

01:18:58.500 --> 01:19:01.140
Oh, it's not AFK for just a moment.

01:19:01.140 --> 01:19:01.640
I'm sorry.

01:19:02.420 --> 01:19:02.820
Okay.

01:19:02.820 --> 01:19:05.940
I said that in talking about the game.

01:19:05.940 --> 01:19:06.180
Got it.

01:19:06.180 --> 01:19:06.580
My bad.

01:19:06.580 --> 01:19:10.820
But I didn't know it was canceled, so thanks to Bobby.

01:19:10.820 --> 01:19:11.460
Okay.

01:19:11.460 --> 01:19:12.020
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:19:12.020 --> 01:19:12.660
Okay.

01:19:12.660 --> 01:19:17.060
So and then there's a whole little update on the particular itch.io there.

01:19:17.060 --> 01:19:18.340
So, yeah.

01:19:18.340 --> 01:19:24.180
I would advise the chat not to make a comment about the history of the game

01:19:24.180 --> 01:19:25.540
until I'm done with my segment.

01:19:26.820 --> 01:19:27.320
Just saying.

01:19:28.020 --> 01:19:28.520
All right.

01:19:29.860 --> 01:19:30.660
What is this?

01:19:30.660 --> 01:19:31.540
I'm trying to see what is this?

01:19:31.540 --> 01:19:33.300
Sadly, no one is streaming this.

01:19:33.300 --> 01:19:36.820
I don't know if that's the discussion about the game or what that is.

01:19:36.820 --> 01:19:37.460
So, okay.

01:19:38.180 --> 01:19:39.620
But yeah, there it is.

01:19:39.620 --> 01:19:40.580
Classic game of the week.

01:19:40.580 --> 01:19:43.300
A very unique pick because I just...

01:19:43.300 --> 01:19:46.420
It looks good though for design.

01:19:46.420 --> 01:19:46.980
No, for sure.

01:19:46.980 --> 01:19:50.340
For something that's kind of like indie made or whatever.

01:19:50.340 --> 01:19:53.300
It definitely looks polished.

01:19:53.300 --> 01:19:56.420
I think is a good way to put it for something that's a homegrown

01:19:56.420 --> 01:19:57.780
and RPG maker type of thing.

01:19:58.420 --> 01:20:00.660
And obviously it's a hilarious concept, that's for sure.

01:20:01.220 --> 01:20:02.500
So, all right.

01:20:03.300 --> 01:20:06.900
Let's move on and get to some rapid fire news.

01:20:06.900 --> 01:20:09.540
We're going to travel around the industry quickly

01:20:09.540 --> 01:20:11.780
and check out some other quick headlines.

01:20:11.780 --> 01:20:14.420
And let's get to Loki starting off with you.

01:20:15.220 --> 01:20:17.620
Yeah, so the Xbox design lab is back.

01:20:17.620 --> 01:20:22.020
So you may remember they had something similar back with the Xbox One

01:20:22.020 --> 01:20:24.340
and I think even Xbox 360 controllers.

01:20:25.300 --> 01:20:26.900
Maybe it's just Xbox One controllers.

01:20:26.900 --> 01:20:31.540
But where you basically can go onto this design lab, customize colors,

01:20:31.540 --> 01:20:34.100
add your gamertag, all that stuff.

01:20:34.100 --> 01:20:38.980
And they'll actually ship you a completed controller in that color scheme.

01:20:40.100 --> 01:20:44.580
So that was originally something that was available for, I think, the Xbox One controllers.

01:20:44.580 --> 01:20:49.460
And then obviously the Xbox Series X came out and Series S

01:20:49.460 --> 01:20:51.860
and the controllers were slightly different.

01:20:51.860 --> 01:20:56.580
So they actually had stopped accepting the custom controllers

01:20:56.580 --> 01:20:59.860
for about eight months or so back in October.

01:21:00.580 --> 01:21:01.780
But it's back now.

01:21:01.780 --> 01:21:04.500
So now you can get your own Xbox Series X controller

01:21:04.500 --> 01:21:07.940
in gaudy colors if you want, which is cool.

01:21:08.260 --> 01:21:12.980
And those cost $70 with free shipping or $10 extra

01:21:12.980 --> 01:21:15.060
if you want to engrave your gamertag on there.

01:21:16.180 --> 01:21:23.300
And then GTA Online is going to be shut down on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 on December 16th.

01:21:23.300 --> 01:21:25.780
Honestly, I'm surprised it hasn't already.

01:21:25.780 --> 01:21:31.700
But in case you're still playing it on the Xbox 360 and PS3, it's going to be shut down.

01:21:33.060 --> 01:21:35.940
I thought that they stopped getting updates on those consoles.

01:21:36.500 --> 01:21:39.620
So, yeah, once again, very surprised that that's still a thing.

01:21:39.620 --> 01:21:45.460
But wow, so many generations in with just one Grand Theft Auto game.

01:21:45.460 --> 01:21:46.660
I am very disappointed.

01:21:48.020 --> 01:21:51.700
Yeah, I keep forgetting that that was actually all the way back to PlayStation 3.

01:21:51.700 --> 01:21:52.740
That's so wild.

01:21:52.740 --> 01:21:54.980
It's going to probably be 10 years old here.

01:21:54.980 --> 01:21:58.660
Well, it came out in 2010.

01:21:58.660 --> 01:21:59.300
No, not 10.

01:21:59.860 --> 01:22:00.980
It was a while ago.

01:22:00.980 --> 01:22:05.460
I don't think it's been 10 years yet, but it's been a while.

01:22:05.540 --> 01:22:09.140
So I'm not surprised.

01:22:09.140 --> 01:22:13.940
Before we get to Jamie's stories, the Xbox thing, can I go back there real quick?

01:22:13.940 --> 01:22:17.220
Because I think it's great that we can make the custom controllers,

01:22:17.220 --> 01:22:20.100
but I'm still irritated we can't get that Pride controller.

01:22:20.100 --> 01:22:22.500
Why can't I make that in the custom shop?

01:22:22.500 --> 01:22:24.260
Because I like their approach to it.

01:22:24.260 --> 01:22:26.900
They didn't just put one rainbow thing.

01:22:26.900 --> 01:22:30.740
They kind of did all this abstract, more type of style to it.

01:22:30.740 --> 01:22:31.300
I love it.

01:22:31.300 --> 01:22:33.300
And I wish I could get that as a controller.

01:22:33.300 --> 01:22:35.220
But whatever.

01:22:35.220 --> 01:22:39.940
It was for influencers only, and I don't count, so whatever.

01:22:39.940 --> 01:22:41.620
Anyway, let's move on.

01:22:41.620 --> 01:22:42.980
DarkSakura for Rapid Fire News.

01:22:42.980 --> 01:22:43.620
What do you have for us?

01:22:44.500 --> 01:22:52.100
Amazon has a gaming service called Luna that has, I guess, a beta out for it right now.

01:22:53.140 --> 01:23:00.020
That's no invite access on Prime Day, which is June 21st and 22nd.

01:23:00.020 --> 01:23:03.220
Prime subscribers can start a seven-day trial

01:23:03.220 --> 01:23:08.100
and get discounts on the Luna controller and Fire TV bundle.

01:23:08.660 --> 01:23:13.860
It costs $5.99 a month and includes some really new games.

01:23:15.940 --> 01:23:26.500
The dedicated controller is discounted from $249 from the list price for $70 for Prime members.

01:23:27.060 --> 01:23:28.820
The controller is $70?

01:23:31.140 --> 01:23:31.640
Yeah.

01:23:32.980 --> 01:23:36.180
And I'm not going to use it because I like Stadia.

01:23:37.940 --> 01:23:42.340
Yeah, I think I've learned my lesson with buying controllers for streaming systems.

01:23:45.540 --> 01:23:48.900
Also, Bayonetta 3 had a teaser.

01:23:48.900 --> 01:23:49.620
It exists.

01:23:51.300 --> 01:23:55.780
It is progressing well according to the developers.

01:23:55.860 --> 01:23:58.660
So it will be out eventually.

01:24:02.020 --> 01:24:02.980
Or so they claim.

01:24:04.340 --> 01:24:05.700
I'll believe it when I see it.

01:24:06.980 --> 01:24:07.700
I hope so.

01:24:07.700 --> 01:24:11.540
I guess, man, the pandemic must really be, you know, because there's that part of me

01:24:11.540 --> 01:24:14.660
that just wants to instinctively go, what's taking them so damn long?

01:24:14.660 --> 01:24:17.220
But then I'm like, oh, yeah, COVID happens.

01:24:17.220 --> 01:24:18.340
It's still happening, really.

01:24:18.980 --> 01:24:23.860
And it's no joke, the type of influence that's had on things.

01:24:24.420 --> 01:24:25.700
So, yeah.

01:24:26.580 --> 01:24:31.060
But and, you know, Bayonetta, one of the best games of the year when it released.

01:24:31.060 --> 01:24:33.540
Bayonetta 2, one of the best games of the year when it released.

01:24:33.540 --> 01:24:37.460
So Bayonetta 3, like, the expectations are pretty high.

01:24:37.460 --> 01:24:41.780
So I guess it's going to take a little while for a cake like that to really sit in the

01:24:41.780 --> 01:24:43.860
oven and reach its full potential.

That is...

01:27:09.780 --> 01:27:10.340
That looks like...

01:27:10.340 --> 01:27:16.820
Oh, it looks like a tactical game involving like nautical battle and things like that.

01:27:16.820 --> 01:27:19.140
Like air to sea, sea to air type of stuff.

01:27:19.140 --> 01:27:20.420
So interesting.

01:27:21.540 --> 01:27:21.940
Okay.

01:27:21.940 --> 01:27:22.900

So, oh, hi.

01:28:09.380 --> 01:28:09.540

So let's go to the UK.

01:28:12.260 --> 01:28:12.820

Lots of games every country this week.

01:29:00.100 --> 01:29:01.620
Not a slow week, that's for sure.

01:29:01.620 --> 01:29:02.420
Awesome.

01:29:02.420 --> 01:29:02.980
All right.

01:29:02.980 --> 01:29:03.540
Let's move on.

01:29:03.540 --> 01:29:05.140
We have a few more headlines for you guys.

01:29:05.140 --> 01:29:08.340
Before we get to some of your feedback via Discord.

01:29:08.340 --> 01:29:09.140
The mail...

01:29:09.140 --> 01:29:10.420
I don't know if we have emails this week.

01:29:10.420 --> 01:29:10.920
We'll find out.

01:29:11.540 --> 01:29:15.540
And of course our chat over at twitch.tv slash vog network.

01:29:15.540 --> 01:29:17.620
But first, Loki.

01:29:18.180 --> 01:29:20.500
This is the headline of all headlines, right?

01:29:20.500 --> 01:29:21.380
It is.

01:29:21.380 --> 01:29:22.500
I mean, it's finally out.

01:29:22.500 --> 01:29:23.860
The Atari VCS.

01:29:23.860 --> 01:29:24.580
You can buy it.

01:29:24.580 --> 01:29:26.260
I've been waiting for so long.

01:29:27.380 --> 01:29:31.220
It's $300 or $400 if you want it like in Walnut

01:29:31.220 --> 01:29:34.180
with the kind of like retro controller in there as well.

01:29:35.060 --> 01:29:37.620
Uh, yeah.

01:29:37.620 --> 01:29:38.420
Or no, I'm sorry.

01:29:38.420 --> 01:29:41.540
With the the Xbox gamepad type thing that's in there.

01:29:41.540 --> 01:29:45.620
Um, what's it do?

01:29:46.820 --> 01:29:47.780
It's a PC.

01:29:47.780 --> 01:29:48.980
It's a Ryzen PC.

01:29:48.980 --> 01:29:50.820
Or at least it has a Ryzen chip in it.

01:29:51.380 --> 01:29:52.260
What can you run on it?

01:29:52.900 --> 01:29:53.400
No idea.

01:29:54.900 --> 01:29:55.400
It...

01:29:57.460 --> 01:29:58.100
I don't want it.

01:29:58.740 --> 01:30:02.500
I wonder, I wonder if they got it when it comes down to like $50.

01:30:02.500 --> 01:30:03.860
But like, I'm not buying that.

01:30:03.860 --> 01:30:07.140
The last headline I saw on this was that Atari VCS

01:30:07.140 --> 01:30:09.380
was doing like a partnership with Antstream,

01:30:09.380 --> 01:30:11.700
the classic game streaming service,

01:30:11.700 --> 01:30:14.900
to have Atari stuff that was like only playable on VCS.

01:30:14.900 --> 01:30:17.140
Like the VCS is going to have its own version of Antstream

01:30:17.700 --> 01:30:22.100
because they were slowly adding some Atari titles to Antstream.

01:30:22.100 --> 01:30:24.500
But certainly there's a lot more that they didn't put on there.

01:30:25.700 --> 01:30:27.940
I wonder if that actually happened or not.

01:30:27.940 --> 01:30:28.820
Oh, it did.

01:30:28.820 --> 01:30:29.700
Okay, it did.

01:30:29.700 --> 01:30:30.180
It did.

01:30:30.180 --> 01:30:32.020
But it also has 100 games bundled with it.

01:30:32.020 --> 01:30:33.540
So 100 Atari games.

01:30:33.700 --> 01:30:34.660
Retro Atari games.

01:30:35.700 --> 01:30:37.140
I'm sure that's worth $300.

01:30:38.260 --> 01:30:41.620
I don't know if I was gonna spend $400 on something like that.

01:30:41.620 --> 01:30:44.420
I would get a 1UP cabinet, to be honest.

01:30:44.420 --> 01:30:48.420
But it's a hard sell.

01:30:49.780 --> 01:30:50.260
I don't know.

01:30:52.580 --> 01:30:53.860
At least it looks nice.

01:30:53.860 --> 01:30:55.060
I mean, if it's a decent...

01:30:55.060 --> 01:30:55.700
If it can like...

01:30:56.580 --> 01:31:00.260
If I only wanted like something to like hack apart to like play retro games,

01:31:00.260 --> 01:31:01.940
I mean, it's a cool looking console.

01:31:01.940 --> 01:31:04.660
But not at that price.

01:31:06.820 --> 01:31:10.580
Yeah, I just don't know what I would really need this for.

01:31:10.580 --> 01:31:14.340
I mean, I guess, yeah, it's like the tiny little computer of itself.

01:31:14.340 --> 01:31:15.380
But I don't know.

01:31:15.380 --> 01:31:17.860
I'm not sure the place it has.

01:31:18.900 --> 01:31:20.500
But we'll see how it does.

01:31:20.500 --> 01:31:22.340
Maybe there's other people that'll have a place for it.

01:31:22.340 --> 01:31:22.820
Who knows?

01:31:23.380 --> 01:31:23.860
Who knows?

01:31:24.500 --> 01:31:24.900
All right.

01:31:25.540 --> 01:31:28.260
Podculture says Ryzen Mobile CPU, isn't it?

01:31:29.300 --> 01:31:29.700
All right.

01:31:30.020 --> 01:31:37.540
All right, moving on to a story about Squeenix and the release of Outriders.

01:31:37.540 --> 01:31:39.780
This was a game that I checked out on Game Pass.

01:31:39.780 --> 01:31:40.260
Just...

01:31:40.260 --> 01:31:43.060
I don't know if I would have normally bought this kind of game,

01:31:43.060 --> 01:31:46.500
but because it was on Game Pass, I checked it out and I did enjoy it enough.

01:31:46.500 --> 01:31:48.020
One of these days, I need to go back to it.

01:31:48.740 --> 01:31:54.580
And maybe there's a lot of people like me out there, because during a recent investors meeting,

01:31:54.580 --> 01:31:59.780
President and Representative Director Yosuke Matsuda said that despite whatever bugs were

01:31:59.780 --> 01:32:03.940
there at launch, Outriders has gotten off to a good start as a new IP.

01:32:04.900 --> 01:32:11.300
Going on to say that they are pleasantly surprised at the digital sales that the title has been

01:32:11.300 --> 01:32:12.260
getting has been high.

01:32:12.260 --> 01:32:15.540
The number of active users has beaten expectations.

01:32:16.660 --> 01:32:20.580
They also say the decision to make the game available through Game Pass as soon as the

01:32:20.580 --> 01:32:24.980
title launch has worked in its favor of building an install base.

01:32:25.620 --> 01:32:28.580
Now, this could mean some...

01:32:28.580 --> 01:32:32.340
Square Enix kind of seeing that this could mean some interesting things for the Xbox

01:32:32.340 --> 01:32:34.180
Game Pass model going forward.

01:32:34.180 --> 01:32:38.740
I'm not saying we're in suddenly see something like Final Fantasy 16, obviously, because

01:32:38.740 --> 01:32:40.660
that's going to be a PlayStation exclusive out the gate.

01:32:40.660 --> 01:32:44.340
But I'm just saying it is interesting now, and I'm sure other companies are going to

01:32:44.340 --> 01:32:48.260
kind of see that where it's like, oh, the benefits of getting a huge install base out

01:32:48.260 --> 01:32:50.100
the gate may be worth it.

01:32:50.580 --> 01:32:53.940
I bet at some point they delist Outriders from Game Pass.

01:32:53.940 --> 01:32:56.020
And it's like, hey, you want to keep playing?

01:32:56.020 --> 01:32:59.460
Now you got to pony up the money, but we'll see, I guess.

01:33:01.060 --> 01:33:08.580
So anyway, in mid-May, Outriders had 3.5 million players in the first month of release.

01:33:09.380 --> 01:33:13.540
And then apparently there was average play times of over 30 hours.

01:33:13.540 --> 01:33:14.420
That's still pretty good.

01:33:15.460 --> 01:33:19.860
If you are not on Game Pass and you want to check the game out, there is still a demo

01:33:19.860 --> 01:33:22.100
that is available on all platforms.

01:33:22.100 --> 01:33:23.460
So you can check that out.

01:33:24.260 --> 01:33:24.760
Pretty cool.

01:33:25.620 --> 01:33:26.120
All right.

01:33:27.220 --> 01:33:27.620
Let's see.

01:33:27.620 --> 01:33:29.380
Going to some comments from our chat.

01:33:29.380 --> 01:33:33.460
Questbuster in chat says the only problem is Outriders end game, which needs some work.

01:33:34.340 --> 01:33:36.820
I've heard that complaint elsewhere as well.

01:33:36.820 --> 01:33:41.060
And yeah, I wonder if there isn't going to be an expansion.

01:33:41.620 --> 01:33:42.020
You know what?

01:33:42.020 --> 01:33:42.820
I bet that's it.

01:33:42.820 --> 01:33:46.900
I bet they don't pull the game from Game Pass, but they release an expansion.

01:33:46.900 --> 01:33:49.860
And then that's where they're really going to make some money from the install base.

01:33:49.860 --> 01:33:53.300
And then an expansion can kind of tweak end game things, right?

01:33:53.300 --> 01:33:55.620
Like that's what we saw happen with Diablo 3.

01:33:55.620 --> 01:33:59.460
Diablo 3 got a way better end game because of an expansion.

01:33:59.460 --> 01:34:02.980
And so I could see that maybe be in their solution to the problem.

01:34:02.980 --> 01:34:04.260
We'll see what happens with that.

01:34:04.980 --> 01:34:09.060
Anyway, sj100matt says I finished the main game, but I haven't touched the post-game

01:34:09.060 --> 01:34:10.020
excursions at all.

01:34:11.060 --> 01:34:12.980
I guess again, that speaks to the end game.

01:34:12.980 --> 01:34:17.460
I just really liked the blend of a little bit of Borderlands with Gears of War.

01:34:17.460 --> 01:34:20.500
And Questbuster is saying I'd love an expansion for Outriders.

01:34:20.500 --> 01:34:24.820
So I kind of see that could be the secret there.

01:34:24.820 --> 01:34:25.700
So we'll see.

01:34:25.700 --> 01:34:26.340
We'll see.

01:34:26.340 --> 01:34:27.460
Anyhow, Loki.

01:34:30.820 --> 01:34:31.860
You're muted, Justino.

01:34:32.820 --> 01:34:33.140
Sorry.

01:34:33.780 --> 01:34:38.740
So let's talk about some limited run games that are immediate and some physical versions of those.

01:34:39.380 --> 01:34:42.100
So they have their own E3 presentation as well.

01:34:43.060 --> 01:34:46.100
Some of our notable things, like we actually have a Turbo Duo game.

01:34:46.100 --> 01:34:51.860
So Castlevania Rondo Blood is getting a new special edition physical release for the Turbo

01:34:51.860 --> 01:34:52.580
Duo.

01:34:52.580 --> 01:34:55.380
And then we have Castlevania Requiem for PlayStation 4.

01:34:57.540 --> 01:34:59.220
Axiom Verge 2.

01:34:59.220 --> 01:35:04.260
We've got River City Girls, Girls 2, and River City Girls 0.

01:35:05.300 --> 01:35:07.140
Shantae 1 through 5.

01:35:07.140 --> 01:35:10.900
Skatebird, which really should be called Skateburb, but you know.

01:35:11.540 --> 01:35:15.540
Zombies Ate My Neighbors and Ghoul Patrol is getting a physical version on Switch.

01:35:16.580 --> 01:35:19.300
Superhot also getting a version on Switch as well.

01:35:20.180 --> 01:35:22.820
And yeah, lots of titles.

01:35:22.820 --> 01:35:28.420
There was, I think, a total of like, you know, like 15 or 20 titles, 25 new titles that are

01:35:28.420 --> 01:35:29.060
in there.

01:35:29.060 --> 01:35:32.980
So pretty amazing that they're still kind of pushing all of the physical release stuff

01:35:32.980 --> 01:35:35.460
and also like, you know, the Turbo Duo version.

01:35:35.460 --> 01:35:36.420
That's kind of neat.

01:35:36.420 --> 01:35:42.340
Yeah, it's so fascinating what that company has been doing for like retro game collections,

01:35:42.340 --> 01:35:46.420
like just putting out the actual, you know, turbo graphics card and things like that.

01:35:46.420 --> 01:35:48.260
It's just, it's fascinating to me.

01:35:48.260 --> 01:35:49.140
I love it, though.

01:35:49.140 --> 01:35:49.540
I love it.

01:35:49.540 --> 01:35:55.700
I think that, I think they sort of, I think Limited Run kind of gets the secret sauce

01:35:55.700 --> 01:36:00.660
about, you know, as the industry is moving to things like Game Pass and digital stuff,

01:36:00.660 --> 01:36:04.260
you know, are physical games going to have a place moving forward?

01:36:04.260 --> 01:36:10.100
And Limited Run definitely sees like, oh, we definitely see where like the, you know,

01:36:10.100 --> 01:36:12.260
the pendulum swinging really hard the other way.

01:36:12.260 --> 01:36:14.900
It's not just a physical release, but collectibles.

01:36:14.900 --> 01:36:18.500
You know, that sort of physical release is really where there's, you know, stuff to be

01:36:18.500 --> 01:36:19.060
made still.

01:36:19.060 --> 01:36:21.460
And I think they're doing a very good job of that, to be honest.

01:36:22.180 --> 01:36:24.340
SHO 100 Matt kind of makes the comparison.

01:36:24.340 --> 01:36:27.380
Limited Run Games is the arcade one up of consoles.

01:36:27.380 --> 01:36:29.620
And I get that comparison, I do.

01:36:30.340 --> 01:36:33.700
Mike Deft in chat says Limited Run should drop the limited, though.

01:36:35.060 --> 01:36:36.580
Then they just be run.

01:36:37.300 --> 01:36:38.660
They could be loading ready run.

01:36:39.540 --> 01:36:45.060
I think that's not necessarily the limited, you know, scope of titles, but, you know,

01:36:45.060 --> 01:36:46.420
they're limited releases.

01:36:46.420 --> 01:36:50.820
I don't think that they're necessarily publishing, you know, hundreds of thousands of copies

01:36:50.820 --> 01:36:51.460
of these.

01:36:51.460 --> 01:36:51.960
Mm hmm.

01:36:52.660 --> 01:36:56.500
And OrangeRite points out the great thing about the Turbo Duo release is that it's 100%

01:36:56.500 --> 01:36:56.820
official.

01:36:56.820 --> 01:36:59.460
It will have the Turbo Graphics 16 branding on it.

01:36:59.460 --> 01:37:02.260
It helps that the game and the console are owned by the same company now.

01:37:02.260 --> 01:37:03.300
Yeah, that's true.

01:37:03.380 --> 01:37:06.900
And don't forget, they had that Turbo Mini not that long ago that was pretty damn well

01:37:06.900 --> 01:37:07.860
received, actually.

01:37:07.860 --> 01:37:10.020
So I enjoyed mine, that's for sure.

01:37:10.020 --> 01:37:10.520
So.

01:37:11.220 --> 01:37:11.860
All right.

01:37:11.860 --> 01:37:14.980
Anyway, one more story for you guys tonight.

01:37:15.940 --> 01:37:18.340
And I love it because it's about a toaster.

01:37:19.140 --> 01:37:20.020
That's right.

01:37:20.020 --> 01:37:24.740
There is an official Destiny toaster on the way out, as if an Xbox fridge.

01:37:24.740 --> 01:37:25.220
Wasn't it?

01:37:25.220 --> 01:37:26.980
Why not, Loki?

01:37:26.980 --> 01:37:27.860
Why not?

01:37:27.860 --> 01:37:28.180
We did.

01:37:28.180 --> 01:37:30.980
Did I not just talk about video game collectibles?

01:37:30.980 --> 01:37:32.180
That's where things are going.

01:37:32.180 --> 01:37:34.660
It is your destiny to make some toast.

01:37:36.260 --> 01:37:37.540
Every day for me.

01:37:37.540 --> 01:37:43.140
Anyway, so yes, you will now soon be able to get a Destiny toaster.

01:37:43.140 --> 01:37:45.300
It is going to cost you $85.

01:37:45.300 --> 01:37:48.260
That's more expensive than a Hello Kitty toaster when they had them at Target.

01:37:48.260 --> 01:37:49.140
Just pointing that out.

01:37:49.140 --> 01:37:53.380
You can preorder the toaster from the Bungie store and it will ship at some point between

01:37:53.380 --> 01:37:56.260
December and January 2022.

01:37:56.260 --> 01:37:57.860
What about my holiday gift?

01:37:58.980 --> 01:38:00.100
Well, there went that.

01:38:00.100 --> 01:38:01.220
All right, whatever.

01:38:01.220 --> 01:38:07.220
Anyway, you also get the Burnt Edges emblem in Destiny 2.

01:38:07.220 --> 01:38:12.660
So if the toaster wasn't enough, you get a little in-game thing, the Burnt Edges emblem,

01:38:12.660 --> 01:38:13.860
which is really fucking funny.

01:38:13.860 --> 01:38:17.540
Now, Loki, here's the part to be less cynical about, the cool part.

01:38:17.540 --> 01:38:18.980
It is part of a charity event.

01:38:18.980 --> 01:38:23.700
So 10% of the purchase price goes to St. Jude Children's Research Hospital.

01:38:23.700 --> 01:38:25.140
So, all right, we have that.

01:38:25.140 --> 01:38:26.340
10%?

01:38:26.340 --> 01:38:27.540
Can they do a little bit more?

01:38:27.540 --> 01:38:28.580
How about 30%?

01:38:29.380 --> 01:38:29.940
All right, anyway.

01:38:30.340 --> 01:38:30.840
Exactly.

01:38:32.580 --> 01:38:36.100
This is not the first fundraiser that Bungie and Destiny has done.

01:38:36.100 --> 01:38:40.740
The Destiny community raised over $800,000 for St. Jude back in June.

01:38:41.540 --> 01:38:51.460
So basically, Bungie offered will make a toaster if you hit the target of $777,777.7 all across

01:38:51.460 --> 01:38:51.780
the board.

01:38:51.780 --> 01:38:56.820
If you hit seven, seven, seven, seven, seven, which why they didn't do seven sevens and

01:38:56.820 --> 01:38:59.140
they did eight sevens, I'm not going to understand, but that's all right.

01:38:59.140 --> 01:39:01.060
They raised a lot of good money, so that's good.

01:39:01.060 --> 01:39:05.700
And Bungie is making good on their promise, I guess, even if it's a little bit weird.

01:39:06.820 --> 01:39:10.500
Anyone in chat going to be purchasing the Destiny thing?

01:39:11.220 --> 01:39:12.020
No one special.

01:39:12.020 --> 01:39:13.300
77 in chat says what?

01:39:13.300 --> 01:39:17.140
No Destiny toilet paper, Destiny doll, Destiny flamethrower, et cetera.

01:39:17.140 --> 01:39:17.860
What do you think this is?

01:39:17.860 --> 01:39:18.980
Spaceballs?

01:39:18.980 --> 01:39:20.660
What do you think?

01:39:20.660 --> 01:39:22.740
It does sound like Spaceballs.

01:39:22.740 --> 01:39:24.020
It does sound like Spaceballs.

01:39:24.020 --> 01:39:28.180
And actually, I think there is other Destiny merchandise out there.

01:39:28.180 --> 01:39:30.020
You joke about Destiny doll.

01:39:30.980 --> 01:39:32.500
They've got Funko Pops.

01:39:32.500 --> 01:39:33.620
I guarantee it.

01:39:33.620 --> 01:39:34.580
Yeah, exactly.

01:39:35.300 --> 01:39:36.580
Destiny, the lunchbox.

01:39:36.580 --> 01:39:37.220
It's destiny.

01:39:37.220 --> 01:39:38.660
The fruit or was it yogurt?

01:39:39.700 --> 01:39:40.820
Uh, that's just you.

01:39:40.820 --> 01:39:41.140
One hundred.

01:39:41.140 --> 01:39:42.340
Matt makes a good point, though.

01:39:42.340 --> 01:39:46.100
You know what Destiny doesn't have is a fanny pack like VOG.

01:39:46.100 --> 01:39:46.740
That's right.

01:39:46.740 --> 01:39:52.420
Thank you for that plug once again for our updated shop over at vognetwork.com slash shop.

01:39:52.420 --> 01:39:53.540
That's right, Destiny.

01:39:53.540 --> 01:39:54.660
You don't get a fanny pack.

01:39:55.540 --> 01:39:56.180
I love it.

01:39:56.180 --> 01:39:56.580
All right.

01:39:57.460 --> 01:39:59.940
Mike Depp says there's a Destiny cookbook.

01:39:59.940 --> 01:40:00.420
Really?

01:40:02.340 --> 01:40:03.620
I did not know that was a thing.

01:40:05.220 --> 01:40:05.860
All right.

01:40:05.860 --> 01:40:12.020
It is time to go to the listener roundtable where I believe Dark Sakura indicated we have

01:40:12.020 --> 01:40:13.220
an empty mailbag this week.

01:40:13.220 --> 01:40:16.580
So she's going to taunt us with churros instead on her webcam.

01:40:17.300 --> 01:40:18.980
Husband brought me dinner.

01:40:18.980 --> 01:40:23.460
But if you would like to, where do you get dinner that comes with churros?

01:40:23.460 --> 01:40:23.860
Hold up.

01:40:25.060 --> 01:40:26.180
Del Taco.

01:40:26.260 --> 01:40:27.380
They have churros?

01:40:27.380 --> 01:40:27.880
Really?

01:40:28.740 --> 01:40:34.020
I usually try not to get dessert at fast food because I already got fast food, but shit,

01:40:34.020 --> 01:40:35.060
I might have to break it for that.

01:40:35.060 --> 01:40:35.700
I love churros.

01:40:35.700 --> 01:40:39.060
Anyway, I need it.

01:40:39.060 --> 01:40:39.860
It was a need.

01:40:39.860 --> 01:40:41.380
I understand.

01:40:41.380 --> 01:40:42.180
I understand.

01:40:42.180 --> 01:40:47.620
We all there's been days where it's like, I need what are like other favorite dessert.

01:40:47.620 --> 01:40:48.500
Oh, Cheesecake Factory.

01:40:48.500 --> 01:40:49.620
Frozen custard.

01:40:50.580 --> 01:40:52.260
Oh, see, I don't really get that as much.

01:40:52.420 --> 01:40:53.540
I eat frozen yogurt.

01:40:53.540 --> 01:40:57.780
So we had a Rita's nearby that sells frozen custard and it was delicious.

01:40:57.780 --> 01:40:59.780
And then they closed their store.

01:41:00.660 --> 01:41:03.460
Because that's what happens when I find something I like.

01:41:03.460 --> 01:41:06.100
We stop selling it or close it down.

01:41:06.100 --> 01:41:07.700
It's like, oh, wait, Loki likes it.

01:41:07.700 --> 01:41:09.540
Quick, shut the doors.

01:41:09.540 --> 01:41:12.580
Isn't that fried chicken place you like that used to be near the studio?

01:41:12.580 --> 01:41:14.260
Like, didn't that come back somewhere?

01:41:14.260 --> 01:41:14.820
It is coming.

01:41:14.820 --> 01:41:16.260
It came back in a bunch of places.

01:41:16.260 --> 01:41:17.940
So I did order a bunch of that the other day.

01:41:17.940 --> 01:41:21.940
And I also ordered a bunch of the actual powder that they put on it from them because you

01:41:21.940 --> 01:41:22.660
can buy that.

01:41:22.660 --> 01:41:27.060
And then I've been sprinkling that on other chicken things.

01:41:27.060 --> 01:41:33.380
But unfortunately, I guess the powder actually is it's good by itself, but it really got

01:41:33.380 --> 01:41:35.620
to have their baked chicken to go with it.

01:41:36.260 --> 01:41:38.420
You kind of need both to be the cracked chicken.

01:41:38.420 --> 01:41:41.220
So we'll have to order some more of that this week.

01:41:42.260 --> 01:41:42.900
Okay.

01:41:42.900 --> 01:41:46.420
Anyway, I was going to plug the mailbag, at least, even if it was empty.

01:41:46.420 --> 01:41:50.500
Even if Dark Sakura found churros in it, which is always a pleasant surprise, you can always

01:41:50.500 --> 01:41:50.980
email us.

01:41:50.980 --> 01:41:55.940
Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you want to send us an email in a future week.

01:41:55.940 --> 01:41:59.460
Um, I will get to Discord in a minute, but we do have some Roundtable stuff coming from

01:41:59.460 --> 01:41:59.700
chat.

01:41:59.700 --> 01:42:00.500
So let's get to it.

01:42:01.060 --> 01:42:04.100
No One Special 77 in chat says, Roundtable question.

01:42:04.660 --> 01:42:10.500
Aside from Magic the Gatherings and Diablo 1 and 2, what games do you know of and would

01:42:10.500 --> 01:42:14.260
recommend that can be played solely with the left hand?

01:42:14.900 --> 01:42:16.740
Too long, didn't read version.

01:42:16.740 --> 01:42:21.620
Since January 23rd, 2021, I can no longer use my right arm.

01:42:21.620 --> 01:42:23.220
Oh my gosh, I'm sorry to hear that.

01:42:23.220 --> 01:42:24.820
That explains why you haven't been around in a while.

01:42:24.820 --> 01:42:26.980
Well, I hope you're feeling okay.

01:42:26.980 --> 01:42:27.860
I'm really sorry to hear that.

01:42:28.500 --> 01:42:31.380
So what gaming I can do is limited.

01:42:32.020 --> 01:42:33.380
Oh, that's a good question.

01:42:34.420 --> 01:42:38.900
I don't know, Dark Sakura, I know there was a period of time where you were having a lot

01:42:38.900 --> 01:42:39.460
of wrist.

01:42:40.340 --> 01:42:45.060
Uh, you'd had surgery on your wrist and so you were kind of doing some one-handed gaming.

01:42:45.060 --> 01:42:48.900
Um, is there any, I'm sorry to interrupt, uh, churro time, but is there any advice,

01:42:48.900 --> 01:42:50.500
uh, from your experience in that?

01:42:50.500 --> 01:42:53.940
Cause I mean, I, I, I haven't been, she was completely different.

01:42:53.940 --> 01:42:55.300
I could still use my thumb.

01:42:55.300 --> 01:42:57.060
I know, but weren't you, weren't you still one hand?

01:42:57.060 --> 01:42:58.100
Oh, you were using your thumb.

01:42:58.100 --> 01:42:58.420
Okay.

01:42:58.420 --> 01:42:58.740
All right.

01:42:58.740 --> 01:43:02.660
I thought you were using, hold on, I'll put it up on, on chat.

01:43:02.660 --> 01:43:03.940
This is what I use.

01:43:03.940 --> 01:43:04.900
I game with this too.

01:43:05.700 --> 01:43:11.300
Um, it's one of the old Microsoft thumb track ball mice, um, that they don't make anymore.

01:43:12.100 --> 01:43:20.340
But, um, the only thing that I could think of is, um, if there's any mobility with the

01:43:20.340 --> 01:43:27.140
right arm at all, like any at all, then maybe a top track ball would, would be something

01:43:27.140 --> 01:43:27.780
that could be used.

01:43:27.780 --> 01:43:32.420
If not, then they do make those one-handed RPG controllers.

01:43:33.300 --> 01:43:37.300
Cause I, right after my surgery, I was playing, um, blue dragon with that.

01:43:38.340 --> 01:43:43.220
Not the, not the toot my own horn or anything, but if you remap some, if you remap the action

01:43:43.220 --> 01:43:49.300
button in your favorite NES emulator, pixel poops number two is quite playable with one

01:43:49.300 --> 01:43:52.260
hand because it's just directional and one button.

01:43:52.260 --> 01:43:54.180
So there you go.

01:43:54.180 --> 01:43:56.020
And I was, go ahead, Jimmy.

01:43:56.980 --> 01:44:02.980
On top of that, as we've, uh, we've told no one special in, uh, a while back, there's

01:44:02.980 --> 01:44:09.300
also, uh, plenty of switch controls now where you can use, uh, head movement or another

01:44:09.300 --> 01:44:13.220
hand for controlling a game with a single directional switch.

01:44:14.180 --> 01:44:21.380
Um, so there's plenty, there's tons of adaptive controllers out there from multiple places.

01:44:21.940 --> 01:44:30.020
Um, my max well, before PCs had it actually had plenty of integrated, uh, accessibility

01:44:30.020 --> 01:44:32.420
options, uh, for various things.

01:44:33.300 --> 01:44:40.980
So, well, and I w that's kind of the direction my, you know, I, I have not been in that situation

01:44:40.980 --> 01:44:43.700
where I only have the one hand for gaming.

01:44:43.700 --> 01:44:48.580
Um, so it's, it's hard cause I don't, I don't really have experience, but my brain was kind

01:44:48.580 --> 01:44:53.860
of going to the, well, the good news is that, you know, more and more games have been aware

01:44:53.860 --> 01:44:54.980
of accessibility.

01:44:54.980 --> 01:44:59.780
And so sometimes it's just about remapping the games that you want to play, but you might

01:44:59.780 --> 01:45:03.060
have to rethink, well, I was, I was going to say you might have to rethink where you're

01:45:03.060 --> 01:45:07.380
playing them because I'm thinking of things like, okay, well, PlayStation four and five

01:45:07.380 --> 01:45:08.900
have it baked into the OS.

01:45:08.900 --> 01:45:13.780
You can change buttons for any game, so you can change it around to basically make, you

01:45:13.780 --> 01:45:15.140
know, just about anything work.

01:45:15.780 --> 01:45:19.540
You just might have to remap the buttons and you can do that within the actual OS.

01:45:19.540 --> 01:45:23.940
But since I know no one special from, you know, having been a long time listener, I

01:45:23.940 --> 01:45:30.260
know that no one special pretty much games like on PC, I think the mouse thing is a great

01:45:30.260 --> 01:45:35.700
suggestion because, and no one special is saying, um, there's virtually no mobility

01:45:35.700 --> 01:45:36.660
in the arm.

01:45:36.660 --> 01:45:41.060
Um, which again, sorry to hear that, but I still think that mouse suggestion about there

01:45:41.060 --> 01:45:43.460
are games that are completely playable with the mouse.

01:45:43.460 --> 01:45:45.540
I know you like trading card games.

01:45:45.540 --> 01:45:51.140
Um, so I would think of other, you know, very mouse focused games like, uh, like hearthstone.

01:45:51.140 --> 01:45:54.900
I would think even things like civilization, you can play almost completely with the mouse

01:45:54.900 --> 01:45:57.540
because I know when I've played that game, I've almost played that exclusively with the

01:45:57.540 --> 01:45:58.180
mouse.

01:45:58.180 --> 01:46:02.420
A lot of things that were developed with the PC in mind have really taken advantage of

01:46:02.420 --> 01:46:02.820
the mouse.

01:46:02.820 --> 01:46:08.100
You might have to get a different mouse, a lefty mouse, but that's, that's pretty common.

01:46:08.100 --> 01:46:12.900
Um, so there's a, that shouldn't be too, too much of a simple web search.

01:46:13.540 --> 01:46:19.300
I found one handed controllers among them being a single handed controller for switch.

01:46:20.740 --> 01:46:27.300
Um, that will, um, uh, I think it's, it's one for switcher.

01:46:27.300 --> 01:46:31.220
I have to double check it, but I mean, they exist.

01:46:31.220 --> 01:46:33.380
You just have to look them up.

01:46:34.020 --> 01:46:34.260
Yeah.

01:46:34.980 --> 01:46:40.100
Uh, and pod culture and chat says, uh, Adam's friend Justin that was sometimes on pod culture

01:46:40.100 --> 01:46:42.500
is also limited to, uh, one arm.

01:46:42.500 --> 01:46:44.900
I'll have to check with what he games with.

01:46:44.900 --> 01:46:49.620
So I do love the paying it forward there in chat to, uh, get some suggestions from other

01:46:49.620 --> 01:46:53.220
people who may be going through something similar, uh, in that situation.

01:46:53.220 --> 01:47:00.020
So, uh, I just found a mini ring, the Bluetooth controller that you play with one hand, one

01:47:00.020 --> 01:47:01.780
handed Bluetooth wireless controller.

01:47:02.420 --> 01:47:05.860
Um, there's the PS one ones that you can use an adapter with.

01:47:05.860 --> 01:47:10.900
There's a Banggood PSDD one, one handed game pad Bluetooth.

01:47:11.540 --> 01:47:16.420
Um, there is the Logitech adaptive game kit for Xbox controller.

01:47:16.420 --> 01:47:19.140
There is one that uses rings.

01:47:20.900 --> 01:47:27.380
There's also a hori makes, uh, what's called the tactical assault commander pro for Xbox

01:47:27.380 --> 01:47:30.500
one, um, which of course then would work on a PC.

01:47:31.060 --> 01:47:37.700
Um, but yeah, there, there's a number, a number of controllers out there.

01:47:37.700 --> 01:47:41.780
ASCII stick, um, for super Famicom, if you want to get into your retro games.

01:47:41.780 --> 01:47:44.020
So they're out there.

01:47:45.300 --> 01:47:45.800
All right.

01:47:46.500 --> 01:47:50.180
Um, I found, uh, a one handed PS four controller.

01:47:51.300 --> 01:47:54.900
Oh, so yeah, they're out there.

01:47:54.900 --> 01:47:58.980
It's nice to know at least that there is the more, more and more accessibility, um, you

01:47:58.980 --> 01:48:02.900
know, and, and options are out there because I feel like if we'd done a search 10, even

01:48:02.900 --> 01:48:05.540
10 years ago, there wouldn't be as many options.

01:48:05.540 --> 01:48:08.420
I don't know if we would have found the RPG controllers.

01:48:08.980 --> 01:48:09.480
Yeah.

01:48:09.700 --> 01:48:10.020
Yeah.

01:48:10.020 --> 01:48:12.020
And they were practically giving those away.

01:48:12.020 --> 01:48:14.260
I have one for like PlayStation and for Dreamcast.

01:48:15.940 --> 01:48:16.740
Um, okay.

01:48:16.740 --> 01:48:19.380
Uh, thank you all for the feedback on that question.

01:48:19.380 --> 01:48:24.340
Let me get to, uh, some of the comments left in our discord over at vognetwork.com slash

01:48:24.340 --> 01:48:25.860
discord throughout the week.

01:48:25.860 --> 01:48:30.820
Uh, dungeon buster had, uh, kind of highlighted a story for us that had to do with, uh, EA

01:48:30.820 --> 01:48:35.700
loot boxes, uh, pulling the quote saying, if you do not buy the pack, you will see the

01:48:35.700 --> 01:48:39.380
previewed pack remains in the store where it is now on a refresh timer.

01:48:39.380 --> 01:48:43.860
The timer has to expire before you can preview another pack of the same type.

01:48:43.860 --> 01:48:48.660
In one example, given by EA, a pack expired in 20 hours and 35 minutes.

01:48:48.660 --> 01:48:53.540
So this has to do with EA letting you see what is in FIFA loot boxes before you buy

01:48:53.540 --> 01:48:53.780
them.

01:48:53.780 --> 01:48:55.540
I think I was reading a story on this somewhere else.

01:48:55.540 --> 01:49:00.020
It's not all the loot boxes, but it's like limited to certain types or whatever, but

01:49:00.020 --> 01:49:00.740
it is interesting.

01:49:00.740 --> 01:49:03.300
I think the EA has been pressured to go this direction.

01:49:03.300 --> 01:49:06.020
It feels like this took forever for this to happen.

01:49:06.020 --> 01:49:10.420
Um, so I'm kind of not surprised to see this happening, but I'm definitely glad at least

01:49:10.420 --> 01:49:14.100
we have a little more knowledge now on, you know, what exactly are you going to be buying?

01:49:14.100 --> 01:49:18.340
It may, it, it takes some of the gambling notion out of it, even if it is still, uh,

01:49:18.340 --> 01:49:20.020
randomized, so to speak.

01:49:20.020 --> 01:49:20.980
So there is that.

01:49:21.780 --> 01:49:22.100
All right.

01:49:22.100 --> 01:49:26.180
Um, Ooh, I didn't know this, uh, 13 X forever in chat.

01:49:26.500 --> 01:49:26.900
Excuse me.

01:49:26.900 --> 01:49:32.580
And discord said, apparently Sega is doing a physical Sonic card game, uh, linking us

01:49:32.580 --> 01:49:36.820
to a tweet from the official Sega account at Sega saying, take your sneakers to the

01:49:36.820 --> 01:49:41.860
tabletop with the brand new game from steam forge available to pre-order now and, uh,

01:49:41.860 --> 01:49:44.260
giving links to a Sonic card game.

01:49:44.260 --> 01:49:45.540
Got to play fast, right?

01:49:46.340 --> 01:49:48.820
Ooh, I remember reading about this story too.

01:49:48.820 --> 01:49:53.700
So thank you for highlighting for this core K in arch, uh, discord chat, uh, has to do

01:49:53.780 --> 01:49:58.980
with analog and those pocket, like that game boy color thing that they were making.

01:49:58.980 --> 01:50:01.620
Uh, they are going to be making more of them.

01:50:01.620 --> 01:50:06.580
And you might remember that they had, uh, some real issues with bots and, uh, you know,

01:50:06.580 --> 01:50:09.300
sniping all the, uh, good stuff and all that.

01:50:09.300 --> 01:50:14.100
They have also talked about analog, uh, that they're going to do robust bot protection.

01:50:14.100 --> 01:50:18.260
So pocket, uh, had sold out almost instantly.

01:50:18.260 --> 01:50:24.180
This is a $200 device that plays Neo Geo pocket color, Atari links, Sega game gear, and multiple

01:50:24.180 --> 01:50:28.180
generations of game boy color color, excuse me, game boy titles, which would, I would

01:50:28.180 --> 01:50:29.540
assume include color.

01:50:29.540 --> 01:50:31.220
Um, but nobody could get one.

01:50:31.220 --> 01:50:32.900
It seems cause all the scalpers got them.

01:50:32.900 --> 01:50:35.300
So, uh, that's great that it's coming back.

01:50:35.300 --> 01:50:38.340
Cause I think a lot of people were like, why won't they make more?

01:50:38.340 --> 01:50:39.220
Well, good news, everyone.

01:50:39.220 --> 01:50:42.660
They're going to make more, I'm going to guess maybe some of the supply and demand

01:50:42.660 --> 01:50:47.540
supply issues, mainly with COVID, uh, probably made this really hard for a while.

01:50:47.540 --> 01:50:49.940
So I'm glad to see it's, um, coming back.

01:50:49.940 --> 01:50:50.740
So there is that.

01:50:52.020 --> 01:50:52.580
All right.

01:50:53.540 --> 01:50:58.900
Uh, if you have some comments throughout the week, uh, vog network.com slash discord is

01:50:58.900 --> 01:51:00.580
the place to leave those comments.

01:51:00.580 --> 01:51:02.260
And of course you can always send us an email as well.

01:51:02.820 --> 01:51:06.500
Participate at orange lounge, radio.com.

01:51:06.500 --> 01:51:09.540
Um, let me check in with Loki and see if we have any last minute stories.

01:51:10.740 --> 01:51:11.220
Yeah.

01:51:11.220 --> 01:51:16.260
So I was going to talk about, there was a leak, uh, showing a brand new Lego Mario set.

01:51:16.260 --> 01:51:19.300
That's a massive Bowser airship.

01:51:19.300 --> 01:51:24.740
So I'm assuming I know where this is going to be coming from, that they're going to,

01:51:24.740 --> 01:51:28.740
this is going to be an announcement that's going to happen next weekend because they're

01:51:28.740 --> 01:51:33.220
doing their first ever Lego con, which is kind of like this virtual convention.

01:51:33.220 --> 01:51:36.020
And they're supposed to be announcing more Lego Mario sets there.

01:51:36.020 --> 01:51:44.580
So, um, my guess is that leaked out somewhere, but, uh, oh, well, I guess we'll see it then.

01:51:44.580 --> 01:51:47.140
Um, but yeah, it looks pretty cool.

01:51:47.140 --> 01:51:53.860
It's got over a thousand pieces in it and it's got a, uh, Kamek in there and yeah,

01:51:53.860 --> 01:51:55.300
the ship is pretty large as well.

01:51:55.300 --> 01:51:56.740
So, well, you know what though?

01:51:56.740 --> 01:52:01.860
Sometimes things leak from companies before big conventions and they still don't materialize.

01:52:01.860 --> 01:52:04.660
I E the Simpsons arcade one up cabinet.

01:52:04.660 --> 01:52:06.340
What the hell happened there?

01:52:06.340 --> 01:52:10.740
Like I want, I want an airship the size of the USS flag though.

01:52:10.740 --> 01:52:13.380
The GI Joe playset.

01:52:14.660 --> 01:52:15.140
Oh yeah.

01:52:15.140 --> 01:52:15.700
Yeah.

01:52:15.700 --> 01:52:15.940
Yeah.

01:52:15.940 --> 01:52:16.580
I love that.

01:52:16.580 --> 01:52:18.020
Well, I know people who have them.

01:52:19.380 --> 01:52:22.420
The closest you can get to that, I mean, would be, it's not there.

01:52:22.420 --> 01:52:27.300
Well, I mean, it's the, uh, Marvel Avengers airship that they had was pretty large,

01:52:27.300 --> 01:52:28.740
but it was micro scale.

01:52:28.740 --> 01:52:32.420
I want a mini fixed scale one, but that would be like the size of my kitchen table.

01:52:32.420 --> 01:52:33.220
So yeah.

01:52:33.220 --> 01:52:35.380
Well, the flag would be the size of your kitchen table.

01:52:35.380 --> 01:52:36.980
So that's true.

01:52:36.980 --> 01:52:37.620
Yeah.

01:52:37.620 --> 01:52:37.860
Yeah.

01:52:38.420 --> 01:52:42.020
Um, man, I miss when they made toy sets that big.

01:52:44.340 --> 01:52:44.580
Yeah.

01:52:45.540 --> 01:52:46.100
All right.

01:52:46.100 --> 01:52:47.220
Any other last minute stories?

01:52:48.020 --> 01:52:49.140
Uh, no, that's all I had.

01:52:49.780 --> 01:52:50.260
All right.

01:52:50.820 --> 01:52:53.860
Well, I think we're, uh, it's a little shorter tonight, but that's all right.

01:52:53.860 --> 01:52:55.540
We're going to get to some final thoughts.

01:52:55.540 --> 01:52:58.420
It's kind of like you had those E3 announcements and then, okay.

01:52:58.420 --> 01:53:01.540
Everybody's taking a break from news cause everything kind of came out at once,

01:53:01.540 --> 01:53:04.740
but I'm sure we'll start to see more and more pickup in the coming weeks.

01:53:04.740 --> 01:53:07.140
Um, so of course, uh, before we get to the final thoughts,

01:53:07.220 --> 01:53:10.020
I do want to thank everybody out there for listening to orange launch radio.

01:53:10.020 --> 01:53:11.780
Thank you for participating with our show.

01:53:11.780 --> 01:53:14.020
Um, your support really means a lot to us.

01:53:14.020 --> 01:53:17.700
Um, if you enjoyed what you heard here at orange launch radio, please tell a friend or two.

01:53:17.700 --> 01:53:20.580
Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice,

01:53:20.580 --> 01:53:25.140
but if the voices aren't here to put out on air, then we were missing the voices.

01:53:25.140 --> 01:53:27.140
So, uh, yeah, tell a friend or two about the show.

01:53:27.140 --> 01:53:30.580
Uh, a nice five star review on a site like iTunes goes a real long way.

01:53:30.580 --> 01:53:32.980
Um, or wherever it is you found this podcast.

01:53:33.300 --> 01:53:37.620
Also, um, the, the hosting, uh, on Twitch for VOG network is huge.

01:53:37.620 --> 01:53:39.620
I really thank everybody that does that.

01:53:39.620 --> 01:53:40.900
Um, thank you. Thank you.

01:53:40.900 --> 01:53:42.580
Uh, appreciate all that support.

01:53:42.580 --> 01:53:44.980
Um, and even if you're, even if you're just here,

01:53:44.980 --> 01:53:48.420
listening to the podcast feed, uh, Monday morning at work, you know what?

01:53:48.420 --> 01:53:49.940
I appreciate you being here too.

01:53:49.940 --> 01:53:50.900
Uh, we all do.

01:53:50.900 --> 01:53:53.460
And thank you, uh, for being a part of the show.

01:53:53.460 --> 01:53:56.260
Email us or tweet us sometimes and we know you're out there or join the discord

01:53:56.260 --> 01:53:56.740
or something like that.

01:53:56.740 --> 01:53:57.460
I don't know.

01:53:57.460 --> 01:53:57.940
Anyway.

01:53:57.940 --> 01:54:00.100
Um, that's all I can think of.

01:54:00.100 --> 01:54:03.300
Another plug for the shop, uh, that was updated with lots and lots of good stuff

01:54:03.300 --> 01:54:06.420
this week, uh, including a fanny pack, vog network.com.

01:54:06.420 --> 01:54:08.260
It's the, it's the must have vog item of the year.

01:54:08.260 --> 01:54:12.100
The fanny pack, vog network.com slash shop for that.

01:54:12.100 --> 01:54:13.700
I'll have to put up a few others.

01:54:15.140 --> 01:54:15.620
Well, yeah.

01:54:15.620 --> 01:54:20.500
And we are kind of watching what sells and what doesn't because we're only allowed to

01:54:20.500 --> 01:54:22.660
list, I think 25 things at a time.

01:54:22.660 --> 01:54:24.340
So like those are we, ha ha.

01:54:24.340 --> 01:54:24.500
Yeah.

01:54:24.500 --> 01:54:24.740
Yeah.

01:54:24.740 --> 01:54:29.060
So we got to, it can't go too buck wild, but like, I think the mat, the masks are

01:54:29.060 --> 01:54:32.900
now gone because, um, they weren't very good, unfortunately.

01:54:32.900 --> 01:54:35.220
So that is, but the mugs, the mugs are great.

01:54:35.220 --> 01:54:36.260
The shirts are great.

01:54:36.260 --> 01:54:38.660
Like everything else that's come from that store has been really good.

01:54:38.660 --> 01:54:45.860
So I put some more tank tops up instead of like just regular t-shirts cause tank tops.

01:54:45.860 --> 01:54:46.100
Yeah.

01:54:46.740 --> 01:54:46.980
Yeah.

01:54:46.980 --> 01:54:47.620
You know?

01:54:47.620 --> 01:54:48.100
Yeah.

01:54:48.100 --> 01:54:52.020
Um, but I thought that people might like want a notebook or something.

01:54:54.100 --> 01:54:56.340
So, and the stickers are actually really good quality.

01:54:56.340 --> 01:54:57.940
I ordered some of my own stickers.

01:54:59.140 --> 01:55:06.100
And like, I mean, I can show you as well for those on in chat right now, I can show an

01:55:06.100 --> 01:55:08.580
example of just like how good the printing is on them.

01:55:09.460 --> 01:55:11.860
So, I mean, I'll, I'll hide that.

01:55:11.860 --> 01:55:16.340
So I'm not doing like cross promotion, but I mean, they're really nice and good quality.

01:55:17.060 --> 01:55:18.740
You're allowed to promote your own stream on it.

01:55:18.740 --> 01:55:18.980
Okay.

01:55:18.980 --> 01:55:20.900
Well then look, come on.

01:55:20.900 --> 01:55:24.180
Well, I just don't want to, you know, ruffle any feathers.

01:55:24.900 --> 01:55:25.700
Fine.

01:55:25.700 --> 01:55:26.260
Oh my God.

01:55:26.260 --> 01:55:27.700
My feathers are so rough.

01:55:29.060 --> 01:55:34.340
Well, but anyway, but as you can see, they're really thick and they're the cutout style

01:55:34.340 --> 01:55:34.660
ones.

01:55:34.660 --> 01:55:39.380
So it's like they have the little pull out pieces.

01:55:39.380 --> 01:55:41.140
Oh, I didn't know that.

01:55:41.140 --> 01:55:41.780
That's cool.

01:55:41.780 --> 01:55:49.220
So yeah, so if you have any like open space, like of a certain gap, then, um, it'll be

01:55:49.220 --> 01:55:50.100
hollow in the center.

01:55:50.820 --> 01:55:51.300
That's nice.

01:55:52.100 --> 01:55:52.500
Yeah.

01:55:52.500 --> 01:55:54.740
They're really, they're really good quality stickers.

01:55:54.740 --> 01:55:56.820
I think they're the kinds that you can put on like water bottles.

01:55:59.380 --> 01:55:59.860
All right.

01:56:00.580 --> 01:56:00.900
Awesome.

01:56:00.900 --> 01:56:01.380
Awesome.

01:56:01.380 --> 01:56:02.260
I was trying to load up.

01:56:02.260 --> 01:56:07.300
I may not, I may not have it, uh, right away because, um, the Twitch panel doesn't show

01:56:07.300 --> 01:56:09.060
me those purchases.

01:56:09.060 --> 01:56:12.500
I only see that when I'm logged into stream labs, which I didn't have the foresight to

01:56:12.500 --> 01:56:13.220
do tonight.

01:56:13.220 --> 01:56:16.580
So I may not be able to thank you all tonight, but I'll try to do that next week.

01:56:16.580 --> 01:56:20.580
Like thank everybody who's, uh, uh, checked out some, I have seen, it does scroll along

01:56:20.580 --> 01:56:21.060
the bottom.

01:56:21.060 --> 01:56:25.060
If you buy it during OLR, you actually scrolls along the bottom and shows that you did that.

01:56:25.060 --> 01:56:25.620
So thank you.

01:56:25.620 --> 01:56:26.500
Thank you for that.

01:56:26.500 --> 01:56:28.580
Uh, everybody that is supporting so far.

01:56:28.820 --> 01:56:33.540
You don't have to, but, um, you know, you guys do ask, can I get an OLR shirt?

01:56:33.540 --> 01:56:37.140
So, um, it, it's only been like 19 years, but yes, you may.

01:56:37.140 --> 01:56:38.580
You may have an OLR shirt.

01:56:38.580 --> 01:56:42.580
No, we ha we did have others, but you know, this is the first like big one that we've

01:56:42.580 --> 01:56:42.820
done.

01:56:42.820 --> 01:56:45.700
That's a print on demand too, which is really nice.

01:56:45.700 --> 01:56:51.460
So, oh, and I wanted just to kind of do something a little bit different cause I don't think

01:56:51.460 --> 01:56:57.620
we actually have an official orange lounge radio logo, which we need to get on.

01:56:58.580 --> 01:57:00.340
Other than that thing.

01:57:00.900 --> 01:57:04.900
I don't, I don't really consider that cause that was made by my ex that I haven't talked

01:57:04.900 --> 01:57:06.740
to in like how many years.

01:57:06.740 --> 01:57:08.100
Um, I, I like it.

01:57:08.100 --> 01:57:10.580
I'm still mad at him for the editing on those pictures.

01:57:10.580 --> 01:57:10.820
Okay.

01:57:12.580 --> 01:57:15.380
We're going to talk about that during the episode one stream this week.

01:57:15.380 --> 01:57:15.620
Okay.

01:57:17.860 --> 01:57:20.980
So, uh, he, was he on that episode?

01:57:21.540 --> 01:57:24.020
Shitty might've been, God, I hope I don't have to hear him.

01:57:24.020 --> 01:57:24.260
All right.

01:57:24.260 --> 01:57:26.020
No, I'm just, I don't, I'm not that bitter.

01:57:26.740 --> 01:57:32.420
But I was, um, thinking of, uh, you know, just like maybe the Sega font was fun.

01:57:32.420 --> 01:57:33.300
So I did that.

01:57:33.300 --> 01:57:39.620
And then, um, I was kind of influenced by that whole kind of eighties retro thing going

01:57:39.620 --> 01:57:40.260
around right now.

01:57:40.260 --> 01:57:42.020
So I did one for VOG that way.

01:57:42.020 --> 01:57:42.420
Yeah.

01:57:42.420 --> 01:57:46.580
Um, I know Bobby was really thrilled with that VOG network logo and I like it too that

01:57:46.580 --> 01:57:49.220
what I wasn't ex I guess I wasn't expecting that.

01:57:49.220 --> 01:57:54.180
So I would kind of file that in the things I didn't know I needed until I saw it Ben.

01:57:54.180 --> 01:57:55.300
So congrats.

01:57:55.300 --> 01:57:59.940
I might have to, well, and I'll tell you actually what started that was the design

01:57:59.940 --> 01:58:02.180
was my branding for, for mine.

01:58:02.180 --> 01:58:05.540
Cause mine's all like neon and everything.

01:58:05.540 --> 01:58:08.900
And I was like, I want to do something for VOG, but I want it to look different.

01:58:09.860 --> 01:58:12.020
And I think I succeeded.

01:58:12.020 --> 01:58:17.220
Um, SSJ100Matt in chat says kind of want that album art thing so I can get it signed

01:58:17.220 --> 01:58:17.940
from y'all.

01:58:17.940 --> 01:58:21.220
Then again, that sounds weird getting something signed by friends.

01:58:21.220 --> 01:58:24.020
Oh, that's, but that's really sweet that you would want something like that.

01:58:24.020 --> 01:58:26.820
So I'd be happy to sign anything anytime.

01:58:27.620 --> 01:58:28.900
It's a little pricey though.

01:58:28.900 --> 01:58:29.620
Isn't it?

01:58:29.620 --> 01:58:30.420
The canvas one.

01:58:31.300 --> 01:58:38.340
I just put it up, I put it up as a whim and gosh, if y'all like it, then, then I'll

01:58:38.340 --> 01:58:38.900
keep it up.

01:58:39.460 --> 01:58:39.960
Yeah.

01:58:40.980 --> 01:58:41.460
All right.

01:58:41.460 --> 01:58:42.820
Yeah, it's funny in chat.

01:58:42.820 --> 01:58:43.380
No one's special.

01:58:43.380 --> 01:58:46.420
Say anyone born on the day or started is now college age.

01:58:46.420 --> 01:58:47.140
Funny you should say that.

01:58:47.140 --> 01:58:50.660
I was listening to a couple of folks, um, their podcasts actually.

01:58:50.660 --> 01:58:55.460
And they were talking about how, um, how they got started kind of in making videos

01:58:55.460 --> 01:58:56.340
on YouTube and stuff.

01:58:56.340 --> 01:58:57.540
And they were talking about, Oh yeah.

01:58:57.540 --> 01:59:02.260
You know, we used to watch all these videos and stuff when we were like seven and this,

01:59:02.260 --> 01:59:02.900
you know, date.

01:59:02.900 --> 01:59:04.740
I'm like, Oh my God.

01:59:04.740 --> 01:59:07.220
Like we started recording.

01:59:08.500 --> 01:59:11.060
Some of my streamer friends, I'm just like, y'all are babies.

01:59:12.100 --> 01:59:13.620
Some are babies.

01:59:13.620 --> 01:59:17.620
It's really one of the, since we had an, we're only at two hours for the show.

01:59:17.620 --> 01:59:20.100
I'm going to allow super tangent train tonight.

01:59:20.820 --> 01:59:26.900
So because, um, like I, I didn't have YouTube when I was a teenager, but I got into pub

01:59:26.900 --> 01:59:27.860
public access.

01:59:27.860 --> 01:59:28.820
You guys know this.

01:59:29.460 --> 01:59:32.420
I actually had like a sketch comedy show I did with a friend of mine.

01:59:32.420 --> 01:59:34.820
Everybody always asks, can we see the tapes?

01:59:34.820 --> 01:59:35.620
Can we see the tape?

01:59:35.620 --> 01:59:40.020
Can we do the, uh, the high spectrum, uh, airing as a channel point reward?

01:59:40.020 --> 01:59:45.460
And the answer is no, I, and it's not because I don't want to, although it is also because

01:59:45.460 --> 01:59:48.100
I don't want to, but I, I literally don't know where the tapes are.

01:59:48.100 --> 01:59:49.300
They are tapes.

01:59:49.300 --> 01:59:50.020
They're that old.

01:59:50.020 --> 01:59:51.540
They're on VHS somewhere.

01:59:51.540 --> 01:59:53.860
I don't even know how we, I have to send them to Bobby to play.

01:59:53.860 --> 01:59:54.820
Cause I don't even have it.

01:59:54.820 --> 02:00:00.580
But I, number one, I, I, if you, if you think episode one is aged poorly, you should see

02:00:00.580 --> 02:00:02.420
my show from 1996.

02:00:02.420 --> 02:00:02.740
Okay.

02:00:02.740 --> 02:00:04.500
That's aged really poorly.

02:00:04.500 --> 02:00:10.740
Uh, and yeah, I don't, if you can get me a tape based camcorder or something, I can

02:00:10.740 --> 02:00:11.460
rip it easily.

02:00:11.460 --> 02:00:13.860
I've got the, the software for it.

02:00:13.860 --> 02:00:15.940
I, I, I literally don't, I don't have the taste.

02:00:16.180 --> 02:00:22.740
I would have to reach out to my former co-host and she lives in SoCal now.

02:00:22.740 --> 02:00:24.180
We're, we're, we're cordial.

02:00:24.180 --> 02:00:29.060
I, I, you know, she, she was the world to me when I was in high school and those earlier

02:00:29.060 --> 02:00:32.580
years, but we've just, you know, life sometimes takes you in separate directions and, you

02:00:32.580 --> 02:00:36.580
know, she's, uh, she's raising her family in Southern California, but we do keep in

02:00:36.580 --> 02:00:37.700
touch on Instagram.

02:00:37.700 --> 02:00:40.900
So I do see, I see her kids growing up on my Instagram feed.

02:00:40.900 --> 02:00:43.380
So there is that she has twins actually.

02:00:43.380 --> 02:00:44.740
So, uh, yeah.

02:00:45.220 --> 02:00:50.180
Um, but anyway, uh, so SSJ100Matt says, Travis has those tapes.

02:00:50.980 --> 02:00:53.780
Travis does not have those tapes.

02:00:53.780 --> 02:00:56.420
What Travis has or had.

02:00:57.140 --> 02:00:59.780
So he used to play this on under station live all the time.

02:00:59.780 --> 02:01:01.380
He did it.

02:01:01.380 --> 02:01:06.340
What he played on his show was a lot like the public access show, but that whole thing

02:01:06.340 --> 02:01:10.980
would like the, the onyx where I was playing like a jewel type character, but I was onyx

02:01:10.980 --> 02:01:11.940
get it, haha.

02:01:11.940 --> 02:01:17.060
And other, because Shannon, who I used to do the show with back in the day, her and

02:01:17.060 --> 02:01:21.060
I went to the same college and we were in the same summer school class and we were in

02:01:21.060 --> 02:01:24.100
the same group to make this project.

02:01:24.100 --> 02:01:27.700
So there was a lot of influence from what we had done on our public access show that

02:01:27.700 --> 02:01:28.820
was in this project.

02:01:28.820 --> 02:01:32.580
So basically that whole thing that was, I don't even remember what the hell it was now.

02:01:32.580 --> 02:01:34.180
You guys have seen it more than I have.

02:01:34.180 --> 02:01:38.420
Uh, but I think, Oh, was that the whole, it's Holanda or something like that.

02:01:38.420 --> 02:01:41.380
Like we did, it's a whole talk show thing.

02:01:41.380 --> 02:01:46.820
And, um, it was, it was very similar to what the would have been on the sketch comedy show

02:01:46.820 --> 02:01:48.260
that we did on public access.

02:01:48.260 --> 02:01:54.100
So that is, is kind of what it is, but technically that tape is not the public access show.

02:01:54.100 --> 02:01:58.660
That is the college project because he probably also has the spice girls music video that

02:01:58.660 --> 02:01:59.140
we did.

02:01:59.940 --> 02:02:02.980
Cause like we had two big projects in the summer class.

02:02:02.980 --> 02:02:04.660
One was to make a documentary.

02:02:04.660 --> 02:02:05.780
That's what it was documentary.

02:02:05.780 --> 02:02:07.220
And we made a funny one.

02:02:07.220 --> 02:02:14.340
And then, uh, the other was to make a, um, music video and he has that, but he does not

02:02:14.340 --> 02:02:19.060
have my old, uh, he he's been trying to find him, but if Shannon doesn't have the tapes,

02:02:19.060 --> 02:02:20.260
then they're gone.

02:02:20.260 --> 02:02:23.700
I don't know where they are because Roseville doesn't even have public access anymore.

02:02:23.700 --> 02:02:27.860
They might've folded it into the government access channel there.

02:02:27.860 --> 02:02:32.100
So they might have the tapes in an archive somewhere, but I would be very surprised.

02:02:32.100 --> 02:02:33.780
I'd be very, very surprised.

02:02:33.860 --> 02:02:35.060
So, um,

02:02:35.060 --> 02:02:40.660
I just have to use the freedom of information act to find it in hell.

02:02:42.180 --> 02:02:44.020
No, that show is not getting out.

02:02:44.020 --> 02:02:50.260
SSJ 100 Matt says if it's PBS, no different, uh, public access and PBS are very different.

02:02:50.260 --> 02:02:56.500
PBS is like the, the, the, the, the BBC of the U S it's the government funded, uh, channel

02:02:56.500 --> 02:02:57.380
that's in every market.

02:02:57.380 --> 02:02:59.940
Public access is local television.

02:02:59.940 --> 02:03:04.420
So I had this show, but only people in the Sacramento suburb of Roseville could see it

02:03:04.420 --> 02:03:06.340
because it was on Roseville public access.

02:03:06.340 --> 02:03:07.460
So what city?

02:03:07.460 --> 02:03:15.540
I think that if you go, there's like a city of Roseville TV and it's the government access

02:03:15.540 --> 02:03:21.140
one that there's, I think a, a request thing through them.

02:03:21.140 --> 02:03:22.020
So interesting.

02:03:22.020 --> 02:03:26.980
I could look into it, but so channel eight was public access and channel 11 was government

02:03:26.980 --> 02:03:27.380
access.

02:03:27.380 --> 02:03:28.740
So yeah, Wayne's world.

02:03:28.740 --> 02:03:30.020
I'm not, yes, wait.

02:03:30.020 --> 02:03:30.260
Yeah.

02:03:30.260 --> 02:03:33.060
Wayne's world actually is not that far off.

02:03:33.060 --> 02:03:35.300
I mean of the concept, right?

02:03:35.300 --> 02:03:37.540
Cause Wayne's world was a rift on public access shows.

02:03:37.540 --> 02:03:38.660
It really was.

02:03:38.660 --> 02:03:42.980
Um, but I think the, like, like you kind of said, the government access, they were all

02:03:42.980 --> 02:03:48.580
about, they air city council meetings, they air, um, you know, uh, government at work

02:03:48.580 --> 02:03:48.820
stuff.

02:03:48.820 --> 02:03:52.820
It's um, C-SPAN for local stuff.

02:03:52.820 --> 02:03:53.540
That's what they do.

02:03:53.540 --> 02:03:57.140
So 11 and eight didn't really cross paths ever.

02:03:57.140 --> 02:04:01.780
But I'm thinking if they closed eight because they had to have, cause of YouTube, anything

02:04:01.780 --> 02:04:04.020
they had, I would imagine folded into 11.

02:04:04.660 --> 02:04:07.940
But yeah, uh, no one special hit the nail on the head here.

02:04:07.940 --> 02:04:12.260
Public access channels were the pre-internet version of Twitch or YouTube.

02:04:12.260 --> 02:04:13.620
That's exactly it.

02:04:13.620 --> 02:04:18.100
So I wasn't on YouTube, but I, I did public access instead.

02:04:18.100 --> 02:04:23.220
And that was, that was interesting, you know, cause it was on TV.

02:04:23.220 --> 02:04:26.980
And so there'd be people that I would meet at Rocky Horror that would be like, I

02:04:26.980 --> 02:04:29.140
saw you on TV like two years ago.

02:04:29.140 --> 02:04:30.500
Your show was weird.

02:04:32.100 --> 02:04:33.140
Yeah, it is.

02:04:33.140 --> 02:04:33.540
It was.

02:04:34.340 --> 02:04:36.260
So anyway, all right.

02:04:36.260 --> 02:04:37.300
That was a walk down memory lane.

02:04:37.300 --> 02:04:39.540
Any other tangents we want to do before we close up shop tonight?

02:04:40.420 --> 02:04:46.020
Um, I'm just gonna do, have some fun with Debbie Delight after the show.

02:04:46.020 --> 02:04:46.980
Good times.

02:04:46.980 --> 02:04:47.700
Good times.

02:04:49.300 --> 02:04:53.700
You don't have to rape me if you don't want to, but I'll be there.

02:04:54.420 --> 02:04:55.380
All right.

02:04:55.460 --> 02:04:57.780
Over at, uh, dark soccer, OLR.

02:04:57.780 --> 02:05:02.180
So underscore underscore, the underscore is very important.

02:05:02.740 --> 02:05:04.020
Um, okay.

02:05:04.660 --> 02:05:07.780
That's, uh, that's going to do it for the show tonight.

02:05:07.780 --> 02:05:09.860
Um, thank you guys so much for watching us.

02:05:09.860 --> 02:05:10.980
I appreciate that.

02:05:10.980 --> 02:05:14.580
Um, and, uh, that's, that's it.

02:05:14.580 --> 02:05:17.540
Uh, I think I already said all the closing stuff and then we got into the tangents.

02:05:17.540 --> 02:05:18.500
Oh, final thoughts.

02:05:18.500 --> 02:05:21.620
I didn't really properly collect final thoughts.

02:05:21.620 --> 02:05:24.340
So, um, Loki, why don't we start with you your final thought tonight?

02:05:24.900 --> 02:05:29.540
Final thought is, uh, if you haven't yet, go, go watch my newest video that I have on

02:05:29.540 --> 02:05:35.060
my YouTube channel, which is, uh, under user at Logilr and, uh, go leave it a like.

02:05:35.700 --> 02:05:36.660
Subscribe if you haven't.

02:05:38.580 --> 02:05:41.300
Um, my final thought is it's a big week next week.

02:05:41.300 --> 02:05:42.900
Uh, my birthday is on the weekend.

02:05:42.900 --> 02:05:45.700
I'm looking forward to that and actually getting to do something this year.

02:05:45.700 --> 02:05:50.740
Um, and then, uh, I also OLR's birthday, so, um, we'll get into it a little more next

02:05:50.740 --> 02:05:54.740
week, which will be kind of like our official 19th, uh, year celebration, I suppose.

02:05:54.740 --> 02:05:58.500
Um, but just, you know, big thanks you guys just showing up.

02:05:58.500 --> 02:05:59.140
It means a lot.

02:05:59.140 --> 02:06:02.100
And I just really thank you guys for being here, whether you've been here for 19 minutes

02:06:02.100 --> 02:06:03.940
or you've been here for all 19 years.

02:06:03.940 --> 02:06:05.140
Um, you're awesome.

02:06:05.140 --> 02:06:06.740
And thank you so much for being a part of it.

02:06:06.740 --> 02:06:08.180
Uh, last but not least our soccer.

02:06:09.300 --> 02:06:13.780
Uh, just two little things, not to be a downer, but this is the first father's day I've spent

02:06:13.780 --> 02:06:14.820
since my dad died.

02:06:14.820 --> 02:06:17.540
So if I'm in a mood, that's why.

02:06:18.500 --> 02:06:23.780
Um, and second of all, um, the matchmaking and dead by daylight is fucking broken as

02:06:23.780 --> 02:06:24.020
fuck.

02:06:24.020 --> 02:06:26.180
And I'm getting sick of the toxic little campers.

02:06:26.820 --> 02:06:29.300
That's I, I want that MMR thing back.

02:06:29.300 --> 02:06:30.260
It was so much better.

02:06:30.900 --> 02:06:31.220
Right.

02:06:31.220 --> 02:06:33.780
The MMR was beautiful.

02:06:33.780 --> 02:06:34.100
Yeah.

02:06:34.100 --> 02:06:35.460
I hope that goes back.

02:06:35.460 --> 02:06:39.860
Oh, and I also have a tick tock now where you can hear me complain about what about

02:06:39.860 --> 02:06:44.020
being a survivor on a, uh, bot controlled survivor game.

02:06:44.020 --> 02:06:45.460
How do you start a tick tack?

02:06:45.460 --> 02:06:47.620
I'm, I'm on the tick tack and I don't know how to use it.

02:06:48.180 --> 02:06:50.260
Well, I just uploaded my own videos.

02:06:51.220 --> 02:06:57.940
Um, but, uh, I recorded a video on my phone of Midna and a little outside cat.

02:06:58.820 --> 02:07:03.380
And, um, I just kind of played around with the video.

02:07:03.380 --> 02:07:07.540
I uploaded the video and then added some effects to it and boom, I had a ticky tocky.

02:07:08.180 --> 02:07:09.220
I have a tick tack.

02:07:09.220 --> 02:07:10.820
I don't remember if I'm Rob Roberts or Mr.

02:07:10.820 --> 02:07:11.300
Rob Roberts.

02:07:12.260 --> 02:07:17.940
And all I have is a video from Rocky horror back in like 2019 where I dressed up.

02:07:17.940 --> 02:07:20.740
My Halloween costume was a PG and E executive.

02:07:20.740 --> 02:07:23.780
And so I was walking around in a suit and tie holding a power cord.

02:07:23.780 --> 02:07:26.340
Cause the joke was I turned off all the power anyway.

02:07:26.340 --> 02:07:27.620
And that was my one tick tock.

02:07:27.620 --> 02:07:31.620
But I noticed like hundreds of people viewed it and I'm like, why?

02:07:31.620 --> 02:07:32.900
This is stupid.

02:07:32.900 --> 02:07:34.260
So it is interesting.

02:07:34.260 --> 02:07:37.060
My funniest one that says only four people looked at it.

02:07:37.060 --> 02:07:39.540
What I'm sure I've linked it to more people than that.

02:07:39.540 --> 02:07:41.860
So maybe it just takes a while.

02:07:41.860 --> 02:07:47.780
I also though took one of my, um, one of my clips from, uh, playing dead by daylight.

02:07:47.780 --> 02:07:52.740
And I put it to music with an intro from just in playing in final cut pro.

02:07:53.380 --> 02:07:56.420
And it's, uh, Amanda young, how to catch a husband.

02:07:56.420 --> 02:07:57.780
And it's her putting David on a hook.

02:07:59.460 --> 02:07:59.960
Love that.

02:08:00.900 --> 02:08:01.460
All right.

02:08:01.460 --> 02:08:03.140
Uh, that's going to do it.

02:08:03.140 --> 02:08:04.100
Have a good week, everybody.

02:08:04.100 --> 02:08:06.180
We'll see you next time here at orange launch radio.

02:08:06.180 --> 02:08:06.980
Have a great week.

02:08:06.980 --> 02:08:09.620
We'll see you next week for our 19th birthday.

02:08:09.620 --> 02:08:14.740
And hopefully some of you on Wednesday as well for the super fun cringe episode one

02:08:14.740 --> 02:08:15.380
listen through.

02:08:15.380 --> 02:08:16.900
So, uh, happy gaming.

02:08:16.900 --> 02:08:17.620
Have fun.

02:08:17.620 --> 02:08:19.460
Uh, don't be one of those jerks online.

02:08:19.460 --> 02:08:20.180
Be nice.

02:08:20.180 --> 02:08:20.680
Bye.

02:08:21.700 --> 02:08:24.340
