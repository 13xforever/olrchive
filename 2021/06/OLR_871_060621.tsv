0	14400	This week, No Man's Sky rolled out a significant visual overhaul. One of the games produced
14400	18680	a groundswell of hype, came out two years later to mixed but generally negative acclaim,
18680	22520	and persisted with notable content and other updates for the next five years. I haven't
22520	26560	seen this outside of an MMO, and graphically speaking, I haven't seen this in an MMO
26560	27560	either.
27560	30720	This is the headline about a total makeover. Now it's time for your hosts Rob Roberts,
30720	33920	Jamie Summers, and Loki to tell you more about this and the rest of the week's gaming news.
33920	36040	Starting right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.
36040	45680	Hello my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show
45680	53240	where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio, and we are live once again after
53240	61840	a little break last week with episode number 871 of our show for this June the 6th of 2021.
61840	67440	My name is Rob Roberts and I have no idea why my camera went itty bitty on Twitch. We
67440	74840	do tape live every Sunday night at twitch.tv slash VOG Network, six o'clock Pacific, nine
74840	80520	o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby Black Wolf show and sometimes live weird things
80520	81520	happen.
81520	89000	If you're supposed to be recording vertical video, that is a big faux pas.
89000	94600	I think there's a brand new OBS that just came out between the time we did our last
94600	100240	show and this one, and I think it did something to resetting the webcam specs, so I will just
100240	101880	have to get that sorted.
101880	105860	But at least you can see my co-hosts, they look fine as we're taping live on Twitch,
105860	109760	such as Techmaster Loki who popped in there. Hi Loki, how are you?
109760	111080	I'm fine.
111080	114560	And of course, let's not forget the one and only DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
114560	115560	Hi.
115560	116560	Hi, how are you Jamie?
116560	118560	I'm okay, I'm tired.
118560	123080	Tired? Well, you've been going like out and about these last few days, right?
123080	128000	Well, I had, okay, so first of all, I had a sister event that I thought was next week,
128000	134280	it was actually yesterday, but I had taken yesterday off. So I took Becky to San Francisco
134280	141800	for her birthday, a late birthday present, so that she could, as she said, not be a mom
141800	142800	for a day.
142800	144560	I like that.
144560	149400	And so we hung out in the Castro and yay, it was Castro during Pride Month, so it was
149400	150400	nuts.
150400	151860	I like that.
151860	160800	And then we went to, we ate at Cafe Mystique, which is really delicious. And then we went
160800	169440	to Japantown because I needed to go to Kinokuniya for a kanji book. And then I needed to go
169440	177280	to Nijia. Now, Nijia Market, they've, it's already really small, but they've really adapted
177280	183120	to the whole COVID thing. There were lines outside of everything, even to get into Daiso,
183120	184120	so it was kind of nuts and funny.
184120	185120	Oh my gosh.
185120	194080	Let's go. But all that walking with my back and my other condition. Yeah. By the time
194080	198960	we got back, I was, I was deadbeat.
198960	202840	And now I turned into huge Rob, but at least I figured out what the issue was. There we
202840	206840	go. All right. I'll fix that, guys. Sorry. Sorry. I know this is like the most-
206840	208840	You just had your mushroom.
208840	209840	Yeah, apparently.
209840	211840	Move it around the entire time.
211840	212840	What was that?
212840	215560	I said, just keep moving it around the entire episode.
215560	220320	Exactly. Now I'll be big Rob. Now I'll be small Rob. See, we love our folks who listen
220320	224440	on the podcast feed. Of course, you can download Orange Launch Radio in your favorite podcast
224440	229280	app, such as Apple Podcasts, which just got a big update recently. Spotify, which has
229280	232800	been getting more and more into podcasts. We're on a few others too. You can download
232800	239320	us in those apps. But we moved over to Twitch a couple of years ago, doing our show live
239320	243440	on Sunday nights. And sometimes, unfortunately, on the podcast, you just miss these funny
243440	248160	little visual things that happen. But I think I fixed myself. How does it look, you guys?
248160	251760	Hopefully it looks good in our chat. Because we do, again, tape live on Sunday nights and
251760	258120	we have our chat room, which is over at twitch.tv slash vog network. And Sia Tabiri in the chat
258120	263280	says giant Rob is going to nom, nom, nom the co-host. Yes, you see there's Pac-Man and
263280	268840	then there's super Pac-Man. And then there's Pac-Man. Super Pac-Man. Okay, I'll stop. All
268840	274960	right. Let's get into our kickoff topic tonight and talk about some things that we missed
274960	279480	in gaming last week. First off, I hope you guys had a good week off. Dark Soccer, I know
279480	283340	you've been on some adventures the past few days. Also, you were you were here streaming
283340	292420	last week, right? Not here on your own channel, right? Yeah. I was playing Dead by Daylight
292420	296320	like I know I really do. And I had a really good stream. It was nice actually doing it
296320	302760	a little bit earlier that night. So nice. It was it was pretty cool. Loki, did you do
302760	306800	anything special with the long weekend, which by which, by the way, I know I know some people
306800	310200	took some heat for saying like, you know, there was there was some political thing where
310200	314260	somebody said, have a good weekend or have a good long weekend. And I understand it's
314260	319900	Memorial Day and Memorial Day is not a happy holiday, but it does kind of share the distinction
319900	325560	this last year of being a three day weekend as, you know, America and, you know, other
325560	329620	parts of the world are getting to the other side of this covid thing. We're seeing numbers
329620	333440	really start to drop. And I think there were a lot of people wanting to really get some
333440	338040	normalcy back. So I think, you know, yes, even though Memorial Day is a is a holiday
338040	342980	that, you know, is a little bit morose because we have to, you know, be thankful to those
342980	348040	that gave their lives for the freedoms that we experience in this country. This particular
348040	351800	long weekend we just had was the first time in a very long time that many of us got to
351800	355520	enjoy some of those freedoms. So I think there's a little bit of sharing going on.
355520	361000	So, you know, I hope people understand why I still say I hope you had a good long weekend,
361000	364520	because you know what, it's the first long weekend we've really been able to get into
364520	369960	in a very long time. But I'm Loki, I'm sorry for digressing. But how was your long weekend?
369960	376320	I am pretty sure I was just playing Minecraft. You've been doing you've been doing a lot
376320	381080	of Minecraft and I saw some cryptic tweets. Would you care to explain yourself or do you
381080	385360	want to do this later in the show? No, I can we can talk about now. Let's talk about
385360	388640	it now. Because even I don't know what the fuck you're talking about with your tweets.
388640	395960	And I got it. And this is probably going to be lost on you guys. But so I am a huge fan
395960	400400	of I mean, there's a lot of people that are huge fans of this group. But there's a server
400400	404840	called hermitcraft. They're like probably some of the most famous Minecraft players
404840	410400	out there. I mean, they've been running this server for years now. And I mean, they're
410400	415560	kind of all streamers, they all work together, they kind of have this unique community where
415560	421360	they can collaborate and just do all these different projects and stuff. So it's real
421360	428360	exciting. So obviously, as of recent, you know, getting back into Minecraft and stuff,
428360	438320	one of my goals, albeit impossible, would be to someday be on hermitcraft to be able
438320	443760	to join them on the server as a member, which is like, yeah, get in line with all the other
443760	447520	people that want to do that, like every single content creator out there that like does Minecraft
447520	453740	stuff wants to do that. I get that. And that's like, it's, it's just astronomically, whatever.
453740	457680	It's fine. The only reason I want to is because like, they seem like really cool people just
457680	461980	to play with. Like, that's, that's it. That's really the only reason not not because I want
461980	465340	to, you know, play with them because they're famous or anything. It's, it's because they
465340	469000	just seem really cool. And like, this would be a fun group of people to play Minecraft
469000	480220	with. So is the punchline you got in? No, no. Oh, okay. That's not the punchline. No,
480220	485560	that would be hilarious. But no, that's absolutely not the punchline. So, um, she kind of get
485560	491380	to the point here. So one of I follow a lot of them in social media. And one of those
491380	497040	folks that I follow is this guy who goes by Tango tech, who he's a big redstone guy,
497040	502960	and he's done, you know, lots of videos and stuff like that. Well, they had a cherry auction.
502960	509320	With one of the prizes being that I can have a one on one session with him. So obviously,
509320	515260	I bid and obviously I won. So I'm going to have him come on one of my videos that's coming
515260	520040	out pretty soon, like, second or third episode next week. So next week, I'll be playing with
520040	523700	one of the members of hermitcraft. It's got like a million followers on YouTube and stuff
523700	528940	like that, to just invite them onto the server, show them around, show them what I did, and
528940	532900	just kind of like work on a project together. So I think that's absolutely cool. Like, I
532900	538980	pick his brain, like content creation stuff, just, I don't know, that really, I mean, it's
538980	544640	like, you just got to get their attention. That's really like, if you want to, like,
544640	548180	have any potential possible first off, you have to have a channel to decent size, which
548180	553600	mine is not. But don't tell yourself short, Loki, you have been committed to that you
553600	558880	you have something that a lot of content creators can only aspire to have. And that is that
558880	563800	you've had the commitment to content creation, meaning, you know, you've been doing this
563800	568520	show with Jamie and I for it's going to be 19 years this month. So don't I mean, at the
568520	573240	same time? Well, I get it. I get it. Like, you know, sure, I don't know the individuals
573240	576720	directly that you're speaking of, because I don't follow the Minecraft community. But
576720	580500	I certainly follow other communities when dark soccer and I sit here and talk about,
580500	584060	you know, we're watching dead by daylight, and we're watching losing color or something,
584060	588580	you know, or, you know, deer or what, you know, one of the big streamers here on Twitch,
588580	591940	I don't expect that everybody necessarily knows those people. But you know, those that
591940	594940	are kind of in the community are like, Oh, yeah, those are the people that really like
594940	598860	dedicate themselves to, you know, streaming those those types of things, and so forth.
598860	602500	So I think that's super cool that you're getting a chance to and it sounds like for a charity
602500	607680	reason, kind of get a chance to to get this guy's ear a little bit, but don't, don't ever
607680	612920	think for a minute that he can't learn something from you to know, absolutely. And it's it's
612920	617680	not necessarily like it. Okay, aside from being able to play with the cool kids as they
617680	623360	put it in chat, it's also the ice so much hate the corporate job world, like I will
623360	627440	do anything to get out of this thing. And like I see that as like this could possibly
627440	631360	be an avenue to like, you know, the YouTube stuff, obviously, I don't know, it's just
631360	635420	like the game creation stuff. Like, yeah, if I put my mind to it, it's just it's time
635420	640700	like a lot of these folks that do content creation as a full time job, like, I can't
640700	645340	put out that level of content because I'm working a daytime job as well. And I have
645340	651420	a family and it's just it's so hard to cram that into them out of time, but I will do
651420	657940	the best I can. That's all I can really do. That's it. At the very least, it was benefiting
657940	663640	the Seattle was in Seattle Shakespeare Society. So it was good to be able to put some money
663640	669680	down towards that. But at the same time, yeah, it's great to be able to, you know, play with
669680	674160	one of the hermits for a few hours. I mean, that hopefully it's not the last time but
674160	679400	like, you know, at the very least, it's a cool experience. I'm glad I get to share it
679400	683320	with the people on the server, because it's kind of like, you know, I really appreciate
683320	688380	them. And I think they're all big fans. So for them, it's just gonna blow their minds.
688380	692900	And so I just am glad to be able to share that with them. So hell yeah. Yeah, I'm just
692900	698060	very excited. It's gonna next week. So next week, I'm filming that I don't know, I have
698060	702500	an episode that's coming out soon. I'm actually working on I was hoping to have it done this
702500	708460	weekend. But like, I like I have done a lot of building over the last weekend. Like I
708460	716960	think about, gosh, 12 to 14 hours worth of Minecraft building. So I had to compress that
716960	724240	down and to time lapses and stuff and touches a lot a lot of work, but lots of planning.
724240	729600	I am so nervous. I've got to plan all this stuff and just get everything ready to go
729600	731840	for Saturday or Sunday.
731840	736720	Well, let's, let's get that plugin one more time for your YouTube channel and let let
736720	740580	our listeners know, you know, you're you're serious about this stuff. You know, dark soccer
740580	744420	myself, we've plugged our twitches enough. Let's I'm sure we'll plug them again at some
744420	747820	point tonight. But Loki, make sure let's get your YouTube out there. And you know, if you
747820	751440	guys have any interest in Minecraft, even a passing interest in Minecraft, or just like
751440	755180	Loki, you want to hear more of his stuff. And this passion that clearly you have for
755180	758780	it where you know, you're you're and you're really taking this next level, please, please
758780	764420	check out Loki's YouTube, which is that it's a Loki olr is the username on there. I mean,
764420	769280	that's pretty much me on any socials just gonna be Loki olr. So I've got a couple episodes
769280	775420	out right now. I've got a third episode, almost done working on it right now. I'm guessing
775420	780000	that this next episode with tango, maybe episode four or five, I haven't really decided yet
780000	783920	because there's gonna be a lot of prep work coming up to it. Got a lot of stuff I got
783920	789720	clean up. So there may be an episode in between there. So it's gonna be a four or five, it's
789720	793340	gonna be so yeah, I got a peek already at Episode five.
793340	797280	Watch it out. Loki make make his appearance like four episodes. Trust me.
797280	801120	I can't. Well, we'll see. We'll work it in there.
801120	805120	Or this is the foot in the door to get other content creators. And maybe they're not as
805120	808380	and maybe they're not as big as individual.
808380	813460	So many like, yeah, outside of hermitcraft, there's so many people that would be fun to
813460	818560	play with. I'm really looking forward is like, I know, I mean, like, we've done like the
818560	823360	VOG network servers and stuff, and that's fine. And it was fun playing with you guys.
823360	828880	But like, it's hard to and even with like the people that I'm with now, it's hard to
828880	834100	find a group of people that can play on a regular basis and that that can dedicate time
834100	839540	to that. And I know when I joined the server, the the invite that was in the Minecraft forums
839540	843860	was that they were looking for content creators to come on and make content together. And
843860	850100	unfortunately, at this point, I'm like the only one doing that of the group, which is
850100	854020	fine. Like they're still really cool people. And like, it's fun to play with them. But
854020	859100	like, I wish it was more of that kind of content creation. There's there's other servers other
859100	864340	than hermitcraft. Like I want to say, well, epic SMP for a little bit. But that's another
864340	868620	example. Also, big YouTubers, big Twitch streamers went together, played Minecraft, and that
868620	873660	died off really fast because people lost interest and went to other things. So it's just, I
873660	878540	want somebody to like, want a group that will be dedicated to a long period of time playing
878540	884260	this game at a level like where I'm at now and being able to collaborate and stuff more
884260	888900	of that because I don't really do a lot of the voice chat with these folks. And it's
888900	893120	just hard to it's hard to record too, because I'm in my kitchen. And like, honestly, like,
893120	897380	I really need a dedicated room because I, it's hard recording all the voiceovers after
897380	902220	the fact. And it would just be so much easier with just the editing process to do all live
902220	907340	in from the get go. But I have to do what I can do within, you know, my limits. So
907340	912820	Well, I think a lot of folks in the chat, like, like, they feel the enthusiasm. And
912820	916460	I'm sure our podcast listeners, you know, even if it's like, Oh, I don't really follow
916460	920100	Minecraft at all, you can feel the enthusiasm coming off your voice. So I know there's going
920100	923260	to be a good video because you're obviously going to be putting like a lot of, you know,
923260	926520	and all your videos are good because you put in this type of passion into it. But this
926520	929740	particular one, especially because you can kind of hear that, you know, this could be
929740	932940	like a jumping point for then, you know, maybe you get to collaborate with some other
932940	936380	small and mid level content creators, which is great that they're looking for something
936380	939980	that you're looking for. So this is great. I'm excited for you. I'm really excited for
939980	945500	you. Congratulations. Thank you. If I may make a tiny suggestion, of course, what some
945500	953100	people do for recording is they'll have like tall, like plywood and do a mini booth where
953100	959400	you line it with the the sound dampening foam. And then that way, when you're ready to record,
959400	965320	you just bust it out for those moments. Well, right. I get that it's not the audio quality
965320	969920	that I'm worried about. It's the I'm in a kitchen with my children and my cat screaming
969920	974440	and they have like that. That's what I'm talking about. Like, I just need another room in the
974440	981520	house, which we don't have. We don't we have a bathroom one that will not work. I need
981520	984880	I need to build in a garage. Are you on a laptop? Because you could come use the oil
984880	989520	or you could use Studio N seven. We're vaccinated. I'm on a laptop. But like, think about it.
989520	993080	It's I just need to build a room in the garage. It really that's what it comes down to. But
993080	997400	that that's the hard part. It's like I even like trying to record voiceovers. I was trying
997400	1002820	to do that yesterday. And the cat, even though she has no sense of hearing, she has a sense
1002820	1008400	of timing where she just knows that I'm doing a video conference or something. It's like
1008400	1012720	comes in, starts screaming. I'm like, great. Thank you for writing my voice over. It's
1012720	1017440	like, I don't know. All right. Well, fingers, fingers crossed. But this this also begs another
1017440	1020960	question. Okay, so so here we are in 2021. And I noticed there's there's there's lots
1020960	1026060	of community things happening. So Loki, obviously, really, you know, starting to jumpstart these
1026060	1030760	things he's doing with the Minecraft community and getting very involved with that dark Sakura.
1030760	1035600	I can't watch a Dead by Daylight streamer on Twitch without running into you and chat
1035600	1040340	anymore. And you obviously doing a lot more streaming yourself and getting to know a lot
1040340	1044120	of those people in that community. And I think making a name for yourself in the Dead
1044120	1049860	by Daylight community. It just came out this week. VOG Network's own Bobby Blackwolf has
1049860	1054180	been involved with the speedrunning community and doing awesome Games Done Quick and Summer
1054180	1058360	Games Done Quick is coming up. And did you all know VOG Network's own Bobby Blackwolf
1058360	1061740	is going to be doing the finale at Summer Games Done Quick this year. It's going to
1061740	1066620	be is going to be hosting the Kingdom Hearts 2. And yes, it's not it's not about the host.
1066620	1071740	It's about the charity. It's about the speedrunners. But I still think that's so cool. You know,
1071740	1077060	like just even be like, just to even be like affiliated with that or whatever is just so
1077060	1087820	cool. What do I have? You guys have been streaming a lot of stuff. You and Alan. I mean, Alan.
1087820	1095120	Yes. Alan has a lot of stuff too. What do I have? Rob? Oh, that's right. OK. Pixel
1095120	1101480	Pacas reminded me I won a fake survivor game two years ago. That is right. When the Resident
1101480	1108600	Evil chapter comes out. Yeah. I said that that would pop my survivor cherry. Mm hmm.
1108600	1114880	So I have to do a swift with you and Alan. OK. OK. I'm so down for that. I was doing
1114880	1119620	a swift without which means survive with friends. I was doing that with Alan the other night
1119620	1125100	and we had a good time. Yeah. I think playing together were also I'm a higher rank survivor
1125100	1129980	than him. And I don't know how that happened. I really don't. I should. I just don't think
1129980	1135940	I'm going to suck at Survivor because I'm not altruistic. See it to be in chat says,
1135940	1138900	girl, you're amazing. Just the way you are. Thank you so much. No, I swear I wasn't fishing
1138900	1143580	for compliments. It was just a really funny opportunity for me to crack a joke. I have
1143580	1147340	the Dragon Con panel stuff coming up. And, you know, as conventions come back, I'll do
1147340	1151580	more and more of that panel hosting stuff. Live hosting is a thing I'm super into. So,
1151580	1156100	you know, I'm teasing. But there are some things I'm into that I'm thrilled to be affiliated
1156100	1160540	with. And honestly, I am giving some thought. I don't know if I should vocalize this on
1160540	1164460	O.L.R. because if I do it, I'm committed to it. But I'm really giving a thought on dipping
1164460	1172300	my toe back into really embracing retro games and doing more with retro stuff and NES classics
1172300	1176560	that I grew up with. If any of you have followed my personal YouTube channel, then like five,
1176560	1183240	six years ago, God, probably longer, I had started this concept of, you know, let's remember
1183240	1187440	where I would play some old games and really not just like kind of talk, but really like
1187440	1191280	do a deep dive into like memories with these old games. And, you know, a little different
1191280	1194600	from like, you know, classic game or anything else is that it's like I'm experiencing the
1194600	1198200	game while kind of relishing in some of the memories of the game. And I'm really thinking
1198200	1203500	about maybe bringing that back actually as like maybe a VOG project. I don't know. Maybe
1203500	1207860	personal channel, maybe VOG. I don't know. I haven't decided yet. But yeah. So that might
1207860	1214100	be it. Maybe I'll get in more with the retro community. We'll see. We'll see. So. All right.
1214100	1219060	SSJ100Matt in chat says it's been a year plus for a lot of folks. Finding that inspiration
1219060	1224420	is harder or easier for some folk and of course, differently. You do you. Yeah. I think that's
1224420	1229540	very good advice. It really is. Okay. So that was a long intro. We still haven't even gotten
1229540	1232900	to our kickoff topic. But no, that was we needed that update from Loki. That's really
1232900	1238320	exciting news. Let's talk about some of the news we missed last week. So we weren't here
1238320	1245620	last week, obviously. And we missed some news. Although with E3 and Summer Game Fest and
1245620	1250700	all that coming up in this next week, obviously the news has been a little bit light, not
1250700	1254260	just last week, but this week as well, just because a lot of the big announcements. Next
1254260	1258580	week's show will be huge because we're going to have a fun show tonight, too. But next
1258580	1263980	week's show, especially because, you know, the Xbox Bethesda big event is in the morning.
1263980	1268320	For years and years here at OLR, we've had to go up against Bethesda during E3. They're
1268320	1272220	at the same time. But now that they're part of Microsoft, they're going in Microsoft spot.
1272220	1275260	So they're going to have a big event earlier in the day. So we'll have a lot to talk about
1275260	1281740	on next week's show. In the last week, so before the week we were off, we did miss a
1281740	1286340	few big things. And I want to talk about some of those. So one of them was the Dragon Quest
1286340	1290900	35th anniversary stream. Did anyone catch some of the headlines or some of the key stuff
1290900	1294900	from this stream? Because there's some good stuff that came out of this, such as confirmation
1294900	1300220	that Dragon Quest 12 is coming. It's called The Flames of Fate. And I believe I believe
1300220	1303980	the way they phrased it was that it's going to be a fabulous flames of hate. No, it's
1303980	1311100	not the fabulous flames of hate, but it's it's it's a more adult version of Dragon Quest,
1311100	1314620	apparently, which is an interesting way. And I wonder if that's sort of a thing where it's
1314660	1318860	like, well, you know, a lot of you have kind of grown up with this series. It also kind
1318860	1323940	of made me think of like Yakuza like a dragon, where like growing up with Dragon Quest has
1323940	1328500	been it was has been a sort of a plot device. So not that I'm saying that Dragon Quest 12
1328500	1333140	is going to be like Yakuza, but I can't help but feel like maybe some of the creative direction
1333140	1339220	to kind of make it a more adult series is because of Dragon Quest influence in mainstream
1339220	1347140	as well as gaming culture. I think it could be interesting. So and Mike Deft in chat,
1347140	1351820	who's gone through a rebrand recently, it appears, says it's going to be a more dark
1351820	1357420	adult Dragon Quest. I'm OK. You know what? Dragon Quest has had a very cartoony look
1357420	1361940	for a long time, and I realize that's a hallmark of the franchise, but I'm OK with them going
1361940	1365100	a little bit of a darker direction with it. I think that could be interesting. I just
1365100	1372540	hope they get a new composer. And let's see, what else do we have a Dragon Quest? Oh, yes.
1372540	1378300	Dragon Quest three is getting an HD remake and it looks really good to 2D remake and
1378300	1382980	it looks really good. And that is a lot of people going, why can't they do this to the
1382980	1388020	Final Fantasy or Chrono Trigger series as well? Hey, well, you know what? If this sells
1388020	1393020	really well, I bet they'll consider it. So, I mean, you know, if this is at all interesting
1393020	1396860	to you, you might want to buy it. Yuji Horii apparently considering giving Dragon Quest
1396860	1401620	one and two the same treatment. So fingers and toes crossed on that. There were some
1401620	1405100	other things announced. I think the other big thing for me, I'm not going to talk about
1405100	1410940	everything they said in that, but I think for me, Dragon Quest 10 offline was announced.
1410940	1414700	So Dragon Quest 10 has been an MMO. It's been online, right? And I think they're getting
1414700	1420240	a new version six expansion even. It's still going. But we have yet to experience it in
1420240	1425900	America. And I don't they didn't say the Dragon Quest 10 offline is coming to America.
1425900	1431160	But in my head, I'm like, that's how they're going to do it. They get this game out and
1431160	1435420	they can localize it. And that's how we'll get Dragon Quest 10 here in America. I think
1435420	1440720	I'm jumping to conclusions a little bit. But the news of a Dragon Quest 10 offline coming
1440720	1446640	is pretty exciting, I think. So we'll see. Any interest from you guys in playing offline
1446640	1450160	version of Dragon Quest? I mean, I'd love to play the online one, but I think the reality
1450160	1456600	is, is never going to be localized or available to come out here. I'm not really a Dragon
1456600	1462800	Quest fan, so probably not. I haven't played Dragon Quest since Dragon Quest. We you should
1462800	1468200	check out. Eleven isn't bad, but, you know, it had it had some things that, you know,
1468200	1471960	but I think this direction they're going with with twelve will be a great thing for the
1471960	1476580	series. They did announce what platforms twelve is going to be on, though, which was interesting.
1476580	1480860	Usually they tell us pretty early, so we don't know if it's a Switch game, PlayStation 5
1480860	1486500	game or what or an Xbox game. You know, we don't know. So stay tuned for more information
1486500	1490820	on that, I suppose. So let's see. So other news that we missed last week. The Dragon
1490820	1496740	Quest announcement was the big one. Sonic also had a stream on May 27th, and they're
1496740	1502100	going to be doing like an orchestral, orchestral Sonic performance during Summer Game Fest.
1502100	1506900	I think that's coming up in the next few days when there's a compilation called Sonic
1506900	1512540	Origins that's going to be coming to the more current systems. Sega loves to put their retro
1512540	1516340	stuff, especially Sonic, on consoles every single time. So this really shouldn't be a
1516340	1523420	surprise, but it'll be nice. Olympic Games Tokyo 2020, the official video game, got a
1523420	1529100	new Sonic the Hedgehog costume. So it looks so ridiculous. The game for the Olympics that
1529100	1532940	didn't happen when they were supposed to happen. And it says this is the official Olympics
1532940	1536580	games, not like Mario and Sonic at the Olympics. So that's why it's ridiculous. Yes, that's
1536580	1541360	why it's ridiculous. And then obviously the big thing that had everybody talking, a teaser
1541360	1547020	for a new mainline Sonic game. No title. We know it's 2022. We know it's going to be on
1547020	1551940	the Switch, but that's about all we know as of right now. So we're just kind of fingers
1551940	1556980	and toes crossed. It's a little more. Where was it? Sonic Mania and a little less Sonic
1556980	1562980	the Hedgehog part? Well, the mix of the update for Sonic Colors. So Sonic Colors Ultimate
1562980	1567460	was something else. OK. Oh, I think I missed that in the list. Thank you. So, yeah, because
1567460	1572300	I did watch this, actually, because I caught it like it happened in the pop up on my YouTube
1572300	1579740	feed. But it yeah, it's interesting. Just the new Sonic game they tease like, you know,
1579740	1584220	sounded interesting. Sonic Colors I never really played because that was I think that
1584220	1591460	was a Wii U game. I can't remember, but it looks good. You know, good remaster, I guess.
1591460	1596580	Some other announcements from the week we were off. There is a Kunio-kun, which of course
1596580	1600660	you might know as like the River City Ransom, Super Dodgeball type of games that's going
1600660	1606060	to be doing a 35th anniversary project. So then those those games, they kind of re-release
1606060	1609740	not that long ago as well. So it's nice to see that there's still a lot of love for that
1609740	1616980	series. Super Bomberman Online Cross Fall Guys can be a crossover going on there. Shiva
1616980	1624620	will be joining Streets of Rage 4 in the Mr. X Nightmare DLC. And probably the other biggest,
1624620	1629960	biggest headline from last week when we were off, no BlizzCon this year. Blizzard announced
1629960	1634820	they're not going to be doing a BlizzCon this year, which is in contrast to some other.
1634820	1638780	I mean, I don't know if this is because BlizzCon is in California, which has been a little
1638820	1644220	slower to reopen, but some other conventions in this same week, such as DragonCon, have
1644220	1648060	announced that they're essentially going, I don't want to say full steam ahead with
1648060	1654060	the convention, but that in-person is part of their plan. I sort of have the gut feeling
1654060	1657140	they're going to, it's, it'll still be kind of a different DragonCon and they're probably
1657140	1661420	expecting less people because there will, they are still pouring everything into having
1661420	1666700	a virtual component as well. So people will have the choice between the two. I caught
1666700	1674580	in chat earlier, MagFest confirmed they're coming back in person January 2022. But Blizzard
1674580	1681420	has decided not for them this year. So they're going to be doing an online event instead.
1681420	1686980	And executive producer of BlizzCon in a statement, Sarah Lynn Smith said, the ongoing complexities
1686980	1691060	and uncertainties of the pandemic have impacted our ability to properly move forward on any
1691060	1695460	of these fronts. And ultimately we're now past the point where we'd be able to develop
1695500	1700100	the kind of event we'd want to create for you in November. That's an interesting perspective
1700100	1707100	too is that honestly, to do BlizzCon in November, that planning starts in like February or March.
1707100	1712260	It takes a long time to put on a BlizzCon. So I can understand for sure the perspective
1712260	1718920	of they don't want to do all this planning and then, oh shit, September, October, a variant
1718920	1723460	is loose or something. I mean, I hope it doesn't happen, but we have to be prepared mentally
1723460	1727620	that might. And then they just got to shut down BlizzCon all over again. And I can sort
1727620	1733820	of see where maybe they also just don't have a lot to say because they've already had to
1733820	1740100	kind of delay stuff, right? We know Diablo 4, not till next year. Overwatch 2, not till
1740100	1747300	next year. Diablo 2, we get this year. But we had a virtual BlizzCon, what, March? Which
1747300	1752220	was kind of delayed from last November. So maybe they're just not ready. But they will
1752220	1758500	be doing a virtual BlizzCon line instead. They're also talking about smaller in-person
1758500	1762500	gatherings and that's kind of interesting too. That maybe they'll have like satellite
1762500	1769340	meetups and stuff like that. But keep an eye on that. So no BlizzCon 2021, but a BlizzCon
1769340	1775660	line sounds like it'll be a thing. SSG100Matt in chat says, kind of wish they pushed Magfest
1775660	1781200	to February again because everyone liked February Mag. Yeah, consider me one of those people.
1781200	1787960	But I don't know if realistically January Magfest can be in the cards for me. I don't
1787960	1793800	want to rule it out yet, but there's a lot going on personally where I don't think it's
1793800	1797240	going to be a great idea for me. And when I can tell you more about what's going on,
1797240	1802560	I think you'll understand. But I hope MagWest comes back next summer because I'd like to
1802560	1808800	go to that for a change. That'd be nice. So, all right. Let's move on. We've talked about
1808800	1813520	what happened last week in gaming. Let's talk a little bit about the next week before
1813520	1817920	we get into our gaming weeks. We've kind of mentioned a couple of times now, but just
1817920	1823640	another reminder, it's E3 week coming up. And this year we also have Summer Game Fest
1823640	1828040	happening at the same time. So you have kind of two big events happening and that means
1828040	1834120	all these other smaller events that are going on for really the summer. Here's some things
1834120	1838480	to look forward to in the coming weeks. The official Battlefield reveal. I think we'll
1838480	1842160	be talking a little bit more about this later in the show, but I'll just say quickly, more
1842160	1848640	information on the next Battlefield game June 9th or Wednesday. That's at 7 o'clock Pacific
1848640	1857360	time. Summer Game Fest, 11 a.m. Pacific time and that would be 2 p.m. Eastern time on Thursday.
1857360	1862240	This will be Geoff Keighley's event. So the people that brought you the game awards. Weezer
1862240	1866280	is going to be playing for whatever reason. But yeah, that's cool. Weezer's cool. Whatever.
1866280	1872320	Awesome. Folks like the studio behind Among Us will be unveiling something. Could that
1872320	1876960	be a new map? Could that be a new game? Don't know. We'll see. But check that out. That
1876960	1882600	will all be on Thursday. Also, another Geoff Keighley event as part of Summer Games Fest
1882600	1889660	will be on Friday at 9 a.m. Pacific, noon. This is a Geoff Keighley and Netflix collaboration.
1889660	1894040	And as you guys know, Netflix has really been dipping their toe into gaming, right? The
1894040	1897920	Witcher does well and that which technically the Witcher was a book. But I think we all
1897920	1902260	know the look at this. Obviously, the fact that it was a game really propelled it to
1902260	1907280	being a series. And so now Netflix between that and the Castlevania anime doing like
1907280	1913400	Netflix is like full on fucking gaming media now, like all these, which is great. Have
1913400	1919040	you seen the brand new trailer? Like I'm not a huge fan of Dynasty Wars, but that trailer?
1919040	1926800	No, I didn't. It's a live action like it's a live action Dynasty Warriors. And it's it's
1926800	1931680	amazing. It takes me back to when I used to go to Fanime and watch all the late night
1931680	1937720	like Kung Fu, Hong Kong cinema stuff. Wow. Oh, my God. It's so amazing. Like I need to
1937720	1942460	watch that. OK, check this out. This is what this is. What's on the list for them to talk
1942460	1947960	about at this Netflix event on Friday? Cyberpunk 2077 because there's that Edgerunners anime
1947960	1954560	is having Tomb Raider, Assassin's Creed, Devil May Cry, Dota 2, League of Legends,
1954560	1959740	Beyond Good and Evil, Dragon's Dogma, Sonic the Hedgehog, which I don't think that's related
1959740	1962920	to the movie, but I guess there must be a series I completely forgot about or anime
1962920	1967160	or something. It was part of the it was part of the Sonic event that they talked about.
1967160	1973560	They're doing a new series. It's about it's based on colors or the Sonic Color stuff.
1973560	1979000	Well, there you go. That's a lot. That's a lot of media based on video games. And they're
1979000	1983660	saying more and more, probably some new announcements out of this as well. The things we don't even
1983660	1988680	know about yet. Come on, Tron. Come on, Tron. I guess I guess Tron was really a movie before
1988680	1992840	it was a game, but they could put it in there and get away with it. Right. Also, Tron would
1992840	1997560	really be Disney Plus. So I'm really rooting for the wrong thing. I just love Tron so much.
1997560	2002760	OK, they had an awesome anime Tron series and they did. They canceled it like they kept
2002760	2009720	my movies. Maybe. OK. All right. You really want to get tin foil hat? You really? OK,
2009720	2014760	here we go. Making my predictions. Subscribe to my YouTube channel. Here we go. How about
2014760	2024200	that long, long rumored Zelda series for Netflix? Wouldn't that be the flack on the table for
2024200	2032680	all of E3? That's just like that. That's so like IGN April Fool's Day content right there.
2032840	2040280	Like I've already been disappointed too many times with that. Like, I don't. Yeah, we'll see.
2040280	2045960	S2 and Hunter Mountain chat says Half-Life three, the movie. Hey, hey. Might as well. We're throwing
2045960	2049960	out all these impossible things. Sure. Why not? Why not? Why not? All right. The movie.
2049960	2054520	Getting into some other stuff. OK, so then E3 star. Oh, actually, I want to shout out the
2054520	2058360	wholesome direct because I think that's really adorable and it's an indie thing. We love our
2058360	2063720	indies. That is on Saturday at 10 a.m. Pacific. I have to do math in my head. 1 p.m. Eastern.
2064280	2070280	That is at Wholesome Games dot com. Seventy five feel good indie games. That's if you want to wrap
2070280	2075960	yourself up in indie games and give yourself a hug. Wholesome Direct on Saturday. Ubisoft
2075960	2082360	11 a.m. on Saturday. Don't know exactly what they'll be talking about. I guess Trackmania
2083160	2088040	and surely some new games in their other franchises as well. I'm sorry. The pre-show
2088040	2096600	is at 11. The show show is at noon. So there's there's two Ubisoft shows. So Devolver Digital
2096600	2104280	will be doing things on Saturday at 1 30 Pacific, 4 30 Eastern Devolver Digital. They they're crazy
2104280	2109960	and in a good way. And I think there'll be a lot of fun to watch there. Their E3 thing last year
2110040	2116200	was the best thing that like first person exploring thing that they did. Did you guys
2116200	2119960	already forget about that? That game they released on Steam that was like their E3. That was the best
2119960	2126440	thing ever. That was awesome. Gearbox is doing something on Saturday, but we don't know when.
2126440	2131240	We do know that there were those little teasers from the Borderlands movie. So I don't know if
2131240	2136040	maybe something's crossing over there, but we saw the very shadowy figures of the actors in their
2136040	2144760	costumes. So, hmm, hmm. Sunday, 10 a.m. Pacific, 1 p.m. Eastern, Xbox and Bethesda. That's going
2144760	2151880	to be a big one. I'm very excited for that. I'm hoping we can simulcast it here at VOG
2151880	2157160	that they will allow us to do a co-stream. If so, I will be on there and whoever. I'm sure Bobby
2157160	2161160	will join me and Loki and Dark Soccer are more than welcome if they want to do some running
2161160	2166920	commentary with that. That's if we are allowed to co-stream. If they do not give express permission
2166920	2171960	for that, then we'll just be in chat and host it and give our reactions that way. So that'll be fun.
2171960	2178200	The PC gaming show. This show has been kind of garbage. I'm going to be honest, not usually a
2178200	2183000	lot to look forward to. Will this be the year they change it around? Maybe 11 a.m. Pacific,
2183000	2190120	2 p.m. Eastern. Loki, am I right? The PC thing is usually kind of stupid. I'm sorry, but they need
2190120	2195880	to kick it up a notch. Square Enix ought to be a little more exciting and that will be it. This is
2195880	2204440	an odd time. 1215 Pacific, 315 Eastern on Sunday as well. So that's kind of cool. And then that's
2204440	2210520	it for the big ones on Sunday. And then let's see. Oh no, I'm sorry. Warner Brothers still is TBA,
2210520	2215240	so they might do something. I don't know. Limited Run Games. So I'm sure they're going to put
2215240	2219240	together some more cartridges you have to own. That is going to be at one o'clock Pacific,
2219320	2225080	four o'clock Eastern on Monday. Take Two is going to do something on Monday. Capcom is doing
2225080	2231320	something on Monday. And then we get to Tuesday, the Nintendo Direct. This is going to be one for
2231320	2238520	the ages. Hopefully we're not hyping it up too much, but I hope this is it. Tuesday 9 a.m. Pacific.
2240200	2246120	All of the Pikmin games. All of them. Like Pikmin, they're going to have Pikmin 5 through 20. It's
2246120	2251880	just going to be one afternoon. Pikmin, Pikmin, Pikmin. I think they really and I, you know,
2251880	2257560	I don't like to set the bar. They they have to update us on Breath of the Wild 2. Like they
2257560	2264360	have to. I'm sorry. Prime 4 and all the other games that they've teased. You know what? The
2264360	2269640	Zelda one is more important, in my opinion. Like the Zelda one, they have to update people on that.
2270920	2274920	If at least they do that, I think they can get away without saying Bayonetta 3 for another
2274920	2279320	Direct. But I think there's a huge expectation. We've got to get an update on Breath of the Wild
2279320	2284440	2. And I fully understand we might not get it, but there's that. I'll come out on the next console.
2285080	2291320	Now Bobby is also saying, note the Nintendo Direct is just about software. That's a good reminder.
2291320	2296840	In their tweet, they said software only. And all these things that said Switch Pro, it's going to
2296840	2300280	be revealed Thursday. No, no, no. It's going to be revealed Friday. Well, guess what? It still
2300280	2305800	ain't fucking here. So this is a big red flag that maybe Nintendo is not doing the Switch Pro
2305800	2312520	this year. And I think we all need to maybe and you know what, Loki? I think we have to give them
2312520	2316600	credit if they made this decision. Maybe they realized they weren't going to be able to make
2316600	2320680	enough of them because of all these hardware shortages. And so they've decided not to try
2320680	2326520	this year. You assume they learned something. They didn't learn anything. They're just good.
2326520	2330760	They'll still announce it. It'll be like so far in the future. And they still won't have it could
2330760	2336120	be a perfect world where we have we're literally drowning in silicon. And they would still find
2336120	2342600	some way to short that thing. Like I don't buy for one second, that no matter when they announce it,
2342600	2347560	that there won't be shortages. And they will be completely incompetent with their, you know,
2347560	2353480	retail flow or whatever. I just, whatever. Um, Bobby Blackwood and chat says, so let me ask
2353480	2360040	this. Why do we need an update on Breath of the Wild 2? It's been a long time. And I know you're
2360040	2364360	not going to accept that answer because Nintendo can really put this out whenever they want and
2364360	2372280	people will eat it up. But I think to an extent, the Zelda fan base is very loyal. It's very large.
2372280	2378680	Breath of the Wild really propelled the Switch to its early success. Even though it was a Wii U game,
2379640	2386520	it really made its case for the Switch very well. And I almost think to go this long without giving
2386520	2392120	the fans even a peek at what's going on, I think is starting to insult the fan base. I'm going to
2392120	2398200	just be very clear. And I know that answer is going to be controversial. But I think with things
2398200	2403640	having gone on this long to not even give a peek or an update or a hint of what's going on or what
2403640	2408680	to expect or what the game's going to look like or what I think it's just insulting at this point
2408680	2413320	if we go past, uh, another year. Cause when did they, I don't, I can't even remember when they
2413320	2422120	did the first reveal. Was it the games, uh, awards 2018 or something like that? I don't know. Anyway.
2422920	2426760	Um, Bobby and chat says, I've never heard of someone not buying a game because they didn't
2426760	2433160	get an update at a specific time. Again, I, I understand that at the end of the day,
2433240	2435960	they're going to release the game. They could just say, Oh, it's out tomorrow,
2435960	2441320	thwack. And it'll still sell pretty good, but will it sell breath of the wild good
2441320	2450120	or will it sell skyward sword? Good. I don't know. Anyway. All right. But there is something
2450120	2452920	you're underestimating though. Bobby who says I would have bought breath of the wild too,
2452920	2456920	when it came out, but since they didn't give us any info at E3 2020, I'm not pre-orders
2456920	2463960	and the industry puts a lot of stock in that. So anyway, I'm going to move on. Uh,
2465960	2468920	what was, uh, let's see. I want to see if there's anything else on this. Usually
2468920	2474520	Nintendo is kind of the end of like the big E3 week, but I guess Bandai Namco
2474520	2479480	is also doing something on Tuesday. We just don't know what time, uh, Elden Ring is still
2479480	2483880	sort of that it's hanging out there. We don't really know like what's going on with that.
2483880	2491960	Who knows? Um, there is a Steam Next Fest starting on Wednesday. So Valve doing a virtual
2491960	2496040	festival that will have demos and things like that within the Steam store, who knows if they'll
2496040	2500440	be doing anything themselves within Steam that is on the 16th. As we start to get further and
2500440	2505320	further out, we get to Wednesday, the 23rd of June, where the Sonic Symphony Orchestra
2505320	2510040	that before, uh, mentioned Sonic stream earlier in the show that is actually happening on June 23rd.
2510120	2515480	The Microsoft Windows reveal is happening on June 24th. And then, uh, of course,
2515480	2521800	Summer Games Done Quick starts on the 4th of July and, uh, let's see, what else do we have way out?
2521800	2528680	OEA Play is, uh, July 22nd. So lots and lots to look forward to throughout the summer,
2528680	2533160	but it's going to be a busy week next week. Uh, and especially as we get into the week after that
2533160	2537400	as well. So we're going to finally be talking about a lot of new games, uh, in the coming weeks
2537400	2542280	here at OLR. But for now, let's talk about the games that we have been playing this past week,
2542280	2545960	uh, or I suppose two weeks if you want, in the segment called How Is Your Gaming Week?
2545960	2551400	Let's go to Dark Sakura. I have been playing a lot of Dead by Daylight. I'm trying to get better,
2552120	2558200	and I'm trying to get that face thing for Plague at the end of, uh, the third, uh,
2559880	2567240	whatever the tome thing is. Oh, yeah. Yeah. The Rift. Yeah. The Rift. Um,
2568280	2573400	and I've, of course, been playing Fantasian, um, really enjoying Fantasian, just trying to
2574440	2579320	explore and take my time with it while, you know, I've got folks watching. Um,
2580440	2587800	I've been playing Wardscape still, um, um, playing Animal Crossing. Um, so those are all my usuals.
2587800	2597560	Um, I did, I'm actually going to be trying down the line some, uh, uh, Mario 64 ROM hacks. I
2597560	2601800	haven't decided which one I want to start with, but those are going to be coming up as soon as I
2601800	2608040	can get something that will work on my Mac. Nice. Oh, and Guns N' Roses Pinball.
2610040	2616200	Of course, Pinball. Of course, Pinball. All right. Um, let's move on. Uh, Loki,
2616200	2620200	how was your gaming week? Um, my gaming week was, like I said, you know,
2620200	2626600	it's pretty much been Minecraft. I did play occasionally some Orna when I go places. Um,
2626600	2632280	but that's pretty much it. It's just been, just been Minecraft. You've really been pouring a lot
2632280	2639480	into Minecraft, huh? Yes. I, this week. So like I built my shop in our shopping district, which is
2639480	2645320	enormous. So they'll be in the next video. And there was a, another community challenge was the
2645320	2651160	one chunk build challenge. So I built a giant redstone rollercoaster in that. And so it's
2651160	2656840	incredibly elaborate, um, also in the video. So, um, that'll be coming soon. You can see
2656840	2664520	all the stuff I worked on this week. All right. Uh, let's see my gaming week. Um,
2664520	2669160	I, a lot of the same stuff, honestly, still been going in dead by daylight myself. Um,
2669160	2673800	uh, got my survivor up to rank eight. So I feel like I'm, which is weird because I don't have all
2673800	2680120	the talents you really need, but, um, I've gotten pretty good at hunting totems and, uh, for better
2680120	2683400	for worse, when haunted ground is in play for those that play the game. Uh, and I'm getting
2683400	2687800	really good at evading. Uh, I'm sorry, not like looping. When I get in the chase with the killer,
2687800	2693080	I kinda start to flop. I need to get better at looping killers. Although, uh, at the killer
2693080	2696840	shack, I'm getting better because that's like the easiest place to loop a killer. So I'm getting
2696840	2701640	better at looping a killer shack. Um, and if you don't know what all this stuff means, uh, watch
2701640	2706120	one of dark Sakura streams or, or one of the many people that streamed dead by daylight here, um,
2706120	2710040	or one of these days I'll finally freaking stream, uh, Alan alchemy. Of course, my husband does a lot
2710040	2716200	of great streams too with a dead by daylight. Um, but, uh, um, I'm getting a little better with
2716200	2720760	that, but I'm pretty good at being stealth in the first place and just not getting caught by the
2720760	2725880	killer. Um, however, you don't get a lot of points by doing that. And I wish, I wish the game did
2725880	2730520	reward stealth play a little more. Um, but you really have to be like willing to rescue people
2730520	2736440	from hooks and be what they call altruistic in the game, um, to, uh, really, uh, up your, um,
2736440	2741320	points. So I've been playing that. Um, I've also been playing, of course, Final Fantasy 14 still,
2741320	2746520	I did Pokemon go community day today. There was a huge Pokemon go community day today. It was gibble,
2746520	2750600	which is one that the fans, you know, it's a pretty rare to spawn Pokemon. And I think this
2750600	2755400	is one that the fans have been requesting for some time. So I think this was a good time with, um,
2755400	2759800	you know, COVID restrictions starting to ease and of course outdoor activity is, you know,
2759800	2766360	really safe, you know, uh, at least if you listen to the CDC, um, this was a great day to do that,
2766360	2771800	uh, to kind of like welcome people back to Pokemon go. Um, I caught 10 shinies in like 90 minutes and
2771800	2776360	that was enough for me. I already had two shiny gibles. So I was a little sad that those got
2776360	2781080	devalued, but that's all right. Uh, I caught 10 more shinies and decided to call it a day,
2781080	2787320	by the way, if you want to know, Oh yes. And I think, uh, yeah. Uh, Mike Defton chat says
2787320	2793240	I went all Shane and got 42. Oh, y'all want to hear the text message from Shane? Hold on. I got
2793240	2802040	it. Ended at 59. I wanted one more so you can have a nice round number. I suppose 59 shinies.
2802040	2807160	That guy caught, wow. Uh, I was fine with 10. That was, that was enough for me. I don't know what I
2807160	2812760	would do at 59 shinies. So, all right. Uh, but gibble, I do love the shiny gibble. And remember
2812760	2817480	for those that know, Shane, the shiny gibble is blue, which is also, you know, another.
2817480	2822760	Oh, well that says it all right there. Exactly. Right. Exactly. Exactly. So there's that. Um,
2824040	2828840	and, uh, I played a little more mass effect, legendary edition, which I know I, uh, popped
2828840	2834920	off as the kids say a couple of weeks ago. Um, but since we had the end of May and the last,
2834920	2840440	you know, week, last two weeks, uh, I had about 70 gigs left in my bandwidth for the month.
2840440	2844440	So I was like, all right, let me grab this mass effect, a legendary patch. You know,
2844440	2848360	I was behind on my patches. So I had like, I don't know, 11 or 12 gigs to download.
2848360	2854120	So I downloaded that patch and then continued my adventures in mass effect one. Um, and, um, yeah,
2854120	2857480	I was having a, I was having a fine time with it, trying to grind some of the achievements and
2857480	2863560	things like that. And I, the mass effect one does play so much better. Like it's a great time to
2864120	2869960	jump in and experience the trilogy. If you've never played before, I would still maybe give it
2869960	2874600	another couple months just to make sure they're not going to do any more patches. Um, but I think
2874600	2882120	this is a it's, it's getting there, I suppose. Um, so, uh, yeah. Um, what was I going to say
2882120	2887080	with that? Uh, Oh yeah. Shane had texted me. Apparently there are still bugs. He sent me
2887080	2891960	a video where he got his character stuck in the Citadel, uh, and was like bouncing around and
2891960	2896920	stuff. So, uh, it's still got its issues, but I didn't find them for whatever it's worth. And I,
2896920	2901640	I don't know if the average player will, but, uh, yeah. So I did, I did, I did play a little more
2901640	2906520	mass effect legendary edition. Um, you know, since I had the bandwidth to download, um,
2907080	2911080	uh, the patch, I don't know when I'll be able to start two and three since I cannot install from
2911080	2915480	the disks. So we'll have to see how the bandwidth looks this month, but at least it's only a 30 day
2915480	2921880	month. There's that. All right. Um, I guess that's that for my gaming week. So, um, I don't
2921880	2926840	really have any other housekeeping or news of note, so I think we will get into, Oh, I guess
2926840	2931720	I should say for the housekeeping segment, uh, we are collecting channel points over at, uh, our
2931720	2937320	Twitch stream over at VOG network. Uh, and if we get enough points, which, uh, on the current
2937320	2943400	trajectory, I think we will, uh, we are going to present a special stream, uh, for folks at VOG
2943400	2949400	network. It's going to be orange lounge radio episode one with commentary from myself,
2949400	2955080	dark Sakura and Loki. And that should be interesting because episode one, um, is probably
2955080	2959960	not a great piece of media, but I think it's a great opportunity for us to really look at how
2959960	2966040	far we've come in the last 19 years and really talk about, you know, some of the stuff behind
2966040	2970120	the formation of the show that maybe we haven't gotten into on the show before. I think it'd be
2970120	2976040	a fun time to, uh, jump back, uh, and take a look. So tell, tell some stories to the children of the
2976040	2985880	olden days. Right guys. All right. Anyhow, horror of me in my twenties. Oh God. Yeah.
2986520	2991080	Hearing myself in my twenties is not something I'm looking forward to. Um, and I, I already know
2991080	2995000	we're going to say something that's going to be like, Oh God, I wish I hadn't said that, or I
2995000	2998040	wouldn't have said that today. I know there's going to be something in there that's going to
2998040	3003800	make me do that. But I think that's also part of, um, I think looking back, acknowledging that and
3003800	3010760	going, wow, I've grown since then, um, is, is a good thing. I do. So, uh, we'll do that. So, all
3010760	3016040	right. Uh, let's move on. Let's get into, uh, this week in gaming news. And I believe we start off
3016040	3023480	with Loki. Yeah. So we've got an announcement of a brand new mini console. Um, this is kind of
3023560	3029960	similar to the one that Sega put out a while back. That was the Sega Astro city cabinet.
3029960	3039880	This one is a Taito egret too many, and it's full of different games, classic games, obviously.
3039880	3044600	Um, they're going to have a 40 games in their total. They've only announced some of them so far,
3045160	3050760	but of course, big names like space invaders, lunar rescue kicks, elevator action,
3051480	3058440	bubble bobble, rainbow islands, extra New Zealand story. Um, they also have several different
3059080	3067240	like controller setups that you can get as well. Um, which looked kind of cool and yeah,
3067240	3075400	it's supposed to be priced at about 18,678 yen, which is about $170. And it's coming out next
3075400	3083800	year. So March 2nd, 2022 in Japan, obviously. All right. I, yeah, I did see the different,
3083800	3088520	like, I want to say they had different like setups for like the actual control panel.
3088520	3097720	So they even have like, say a, um, Oh, they called it the paddle and trackball games. So I
3097720	3101240	don't know if they actually have a paddle and stuff in there, but, um, arcinoids in there as
3101240	3107160	well and arcinoid returns. Um, but yeah, pretty cool lineup. Yeah. And I love the, the monitor
3107160	3115560	thing is pretty cool. So yeah. Um, I, uh, I don't know how many arcade replicas I can fit in my
3115560	3121720	house, but that does sound nice. Uh, especially, uh, you know, there's stuff coming up later,
3121720	3126520	but, uh, arcade went up, but I mean, we all know that's a thing. Uh, dark soccer has got
3126520	3131000	pinball machines to deal with as well. It's almost like there's too many big collectibles
3131240	3140280	All right. Let's talk about some virtual things. Yeah. Never enough is the correct,
3140280	3145560	uh, answer, I suppose. All right. Let's talk about things that are virtual in the game creating
3145560	3151320	space. Facebook has made another purchase this week. Um, which, you know, man, I'm not a huge
3151320	3155960	fan of Facebook, but this one at least makes a little bit of sense to me. I think even if you
3155960	3160680	were kind of like, I don't understand why Facebook bought Oculus, even though I think that actually
3160680	3164760	does make a lot of sense, but we're not going to retread that old ground tonight. Uh, this,
3164760	3171400	this is an interesting one. So they've bought a game making platform called U well unit two games
3171400	3177640	is who they bought unit two games made something called Crayta. This is a collaborative game
3177640	3183640	creating platform that was built on unreal engine four. It's actually in Google Stadia,
3183640	3188760	uh, which I didn't realize at all. Maybe I didn't play around with Stadia enough. Uh, I doubt you've
3188760	3192280	come across this. You're, you're kind of the Stadia fan in the house, dark soccer, but I doubt
3192280	3198200	you've come across this yet. Oh, maybe you did. I don't know. I have it. Oh, have you, oh, have you
3198200	3202520	played around with it at all? No, it was free. Oh, huh. Uh, I remember seeing some of like the
3202520	3206600	previews and the trailers for it. So I thought it was interesting, but yeah, so it started as a
3206600	3211880	Stadia, uh, exclusive, but now Facebook is going to be absorbing this team and now Facebook has a
3211880	3218040	part of the technology. Uh, however, uh, in the FAQs that were posted about this acquisition,
3218040	3222280	uh, this team is not going to stop working on Crayta. The game will still continue to be
3222280	3225800	available. So don't think that, Oh, they're going to shut down the Stadia one and move it to
3225800	3229720	Facebook or whatever it is. Although I imagine Facebook is going to be getting its own version
3229720	3235960	of this, but Facebook has purchased the company to make game creation, more accessible and easy
3235960	3242280	to use. And they're looking to integrate Crayta's creation tool set into Facebook gaming's cloud
3242280	3249160	platform to instantly deliver new experiences via Facebook. Now, keep in mind in Crayta,
3249160	3253880	you can make your own games, you know, it's, it's kind of limited coding, uh, whatever your comfort
3253880	3259560	level is there. Uh, and then folks play the games and you can, they can actually earn money for,
3259560	3265800	I'd say you can earn money when they play your games. Um, so that's kind of interesting. Uh,
3265800	3269160	is that maybe there's going to be a whole little money-making thing there that Facebook wants to
3269160	3278120	get in on. Um, I don't know. Any thoughts on that with Facebook getting into that? Uh, I kind of
3278120	3283560	does. It really does. Yeah. I was thinking of something like that. Something that is,
3285080	3289000	you know, it all comes down to money anyway, but I think that they're trying to get in on the
3289000	3295320	younger market. Yes, that's for sure. Uh, going to our chat, uh, Legend of Zaku. Welcome back,
3295400	3300280	by the way. And chat says, I can't see how this is a plus for Facebook other than to milk it to
3300280	3305720	holy hell. Well, if they see money in it, that's how it's a plus for Facebook, but I could see how
3305720	3310760	they might want to integrate it within Facebook where it's like, imagine if you're scrolling on
3310760	3316520	your Facebook feed, right? And one thing you scroll across is, Hey, Oh, here's Bobby Blackwolf,
3316520	3322120	uh, who just posted an update. Check out my newest version of flappy vog. And now it's right there
3322120	3325640	on the feed. And you could check that out or you're scrolling past. There's Loki,
3325640	3331640	here's pixel poops recreated in crater or YY or whoever makes it. And you can play it, uh, in your
3331640	3335880	Facebook feed. I kind of think that might be a direction that Facebook's going in with that.
3335880	3340280	Just like I always thought their Oculus acquisition was less about the games and more
3340280	3345000	about, they want to be able to deliver like experiences in VR. They want to be able to have a
3345000	3350680	Facebook feed in VR, so to speak. I think that's where they want really want to be a few years from
3350680	3356440	now. Maybe not. It may be a hard thing to envision right now, but imagine if you, instead of reading
3356440	3362280	somebody's update, got to experience somebody's update. I think that's where Facebook moves with
3362280	3367240	Oculus. And I think that's where they want to experience my updates. And, and that's why I
3367240	3371800	also kind of think like Facebook, it's a bit much, but I just feel like that's what they, that's
3371800	3376920	where they're going with this is why not make your up? Why not make life updates experiences?
3377480	3380760	And maybe you're not going to do it dark soccer, but I bet there's a lot of people,
3381400	3386200	you know, especially as more and more younger folks are growing up with things like TikTok,
3386200	3391560	Facebook, Instagram, uh, Twitter, all integrated into culture. I bet there's people that are going
3391560	3397720	to be more than willing to share stuff, maybe too much so, uh, in this. The thing is, is that people
3397720	3403800	are getting away from Facebook. I mean, this is my thought of like them trying to find a way to
3403800	3411160	bring people back, but fair in the end, their usage in certain demographics is way decreased.
3411160	3415080	Yeah. I guess I don't think I've posted anything on Facebook other than,
3415080	3421800	oh, we have OLR and I've done like Instagram stuff. I rarely post to Facebook anymore myself.
3421800	3425880	Um, because, uh, you know, when I have a quick thought, Twitter's usually easier, but also just
3425880	3430120	like, and, and somebody was saying this on a podcast and I'm sorry, I don't remember who
3430120	3433960	was saying it or what podcast, cause I was absorbing a lot of the last couple of weeks
3433960	3437880	and a lot of driving that I was doing. But, um, somebody had said that, you know,
3437880	3443320	Facebook was great when it was actually people's updates and pictures and things that were actually
3443320	3449720	about people. But now you go on Facebook and all it is, it's headlines, it's clips, it's, um,
3449720	3457800	uh, copy pasted links. It's, you know, uh, uh, things that are curated to get this emotional
3457800	3462440	response from you to click an article. And it's not like the personality has been sucked out of
3462440	3469480	Facebook. I think that was a great way of analyzing personal posts, you know, like Instagram is,
3469480	3475080	you know, basically where my pictures come from. And, you know, I haven't logged into my,
3475080	3481320	my sister's Facebook in two months for, for sisters of professional indulgence.
3481320	3485240	But, um, but you know, I'm not saying like this live journal, you know, I'm not saying you
3485240	3488840	specifically, or even the people in chat that are saying something similar specifically. I'm
3488840	3494120	just saying Facebook as a whole is just hard to get through because it's nothing but emotional
3494120	3500840	response crap. Yeah. And I'm, I think we're all, I want nothing to do with it. Yeah, I get you.
3500840	3504200	Whatever happened to that pillow fort that was kind of like modern live journals,
3504200	3508040	they ever come back, they got pulled offline for like a security thing. Did they ever come back?
3508920	3511960	Remember you and I posted on there like twice and then they took it down.
3512600	3517480	I have to look into that. All right. I have to look. I was eating eggs.
3517480	3521560	No, you're fine. You're fine. Um, so I have to look into that. I am about to toss over the
3521560	3526040	next story though. Just be warned. Uh, but I'm looking here. Okay, good. Looking in our chat, um,
3526600	3532600	bonds, double six and chat says I post to Nami is back bitches every Saturday at 12.
3532600	3537080	That's the bulk of my Facebook posts. That's fine. And that's a lot of what I see on Twitter,
3537080	3542680	honestly, is that type of thing. So, uh, bonds double six also says I've been doing that for
3542680	3550200	years. I have friends that DM me if I'm three minutes late. I love that. That's funny. All
3550200	3557400	right. For the record, I just logged into pillow fort. Oh, so it works again. Looks like it's back.
3557400	3562600	All right. I'll have to go make an update. That's fun. Follow me, you guys. All right.
3563400	3566840	Let's get into our next story though. Uh, dark side, speaking of people moving, right?
3567560	3574600	Well, this isn't just moving. This is complete leaving. Um, Yuji Naka, the man, the legend,
3574600	3586520	um, he has, uh, confirmed that he's left, uh, squinnicks. Um, he, uh, he actually did resign
3586520	3592200	from his position in April. Um, he says he can't talk about it, but he's considering retiring from
3592360	3597640	video games altogether. Um, the quote, and I'll just read it directly translated. Of course,
3598520	3604440	due to inquiries from the media and users on Twitters, I resigned from square annex at the end
3604440	3609560	of April, 2021. I cannot tell you why right now, but I hope to be able to tell you when the time
3609560	3615720	comes as for my future plans, I'm already 55 years old. So retirement is in the cards. Here is a photo
3615720	3621480	that was taken for the Sega console Historia interview. So it's a cute photo.
3624360	3628920	So I've seen this has to do with Bella and Wonderland not being so wonderful.
3628920	3634040	It did not sell well in Japan. It, uh, apparently the sales, I don't know how it did here,
3634040	3638920	but I don't think it did very well here either. And I think, I think it was that demo. I think
3638920	3645320	that demo scared so many people off. Uh, I think it's gonna, I think this could be one for,
3645400	3651640	you know, the, the history archives about, um, what to not do with your demo. But I think at the end,
3651640	3657560	at the end, um, but Nino Cooney still sold enough to make a sequel, even though that demo was
3657560	3661640	terrible, but I don't know if it's just maybe the state of social media now versus the state
3661640	3666680	of social media when Nino Cooney's demo was out, which was a long time ago at this point. Um,
3666680	3672040	but that really to, and I, to be fair, I don't think the game either really got a,
3672040	3676280	turned a lot of heads. Some people are really into it. That game definitely has its defenders
3676280	3680120	and I haven't played it. So I don't have an opinion either way, but I can say the way y'all
3680120	3686280	reacted to it, uh, made me go and I can pass on this, but it's sad for somebody like Yuji Naka,
3686280	3694840	who has such a legendary resume. Um, but at the same time, sometimes, sometimes great artists flop
3694840	3700120	and it happens. It happens in music. I have a picture of Dan and Yuji Naka from the early
3700120	3705080	2000s. Oh, that's awesome. From like E3 or something. Look at Mighty No. 9. I mean,
3705640	3711720	that was something that like had the pedigree to be really great, but it just didn't end up
3711720	3717480	working out. Yeah. And this, this happens sometimes in, in like music, like, uh, Kelly
3717480	3723080	Clarkson's My December album compared to her others, not her greatest one. And there's,
3723080	3725800	there's plenty of others too. I don't know why that one came to mind. I'm trying to think of
3725800	3731000	musicians where it's like, they released a real stinker, but a lot of their albums are usually
3731000	3736280	pretty better well-received. Uh, and movies. I'm sure y'all know, I'm sure y'all know a director
3736280	3740840	who makes great movies, but then they put out a real, a real turd once in a while. Like it
3740840	3749160	happens, right? So, um, Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, uh, Saint Anger by Metallica is an example
3749160	3755080	of what I was talking about. Um, so, uh, PixelPakas agrees. This is My December. Yep.
3755080	3759640	Uh, and, uh, there are folks in chat are talking about if, uh, uh, the Battle of Wonderland,
3759640	3764760	it flopped hard. Uh, Square has already put it on sale at least once, says Sacred Jade.
3764760	3770760	Uh, Mike Deff says not even like two weeks after release and it's already $20 USD off.
3770760	3775880	Yep. Uh, Questbuster in chat says Shroud of the Avatar by Richard Garriott. Oh,
3775880	3781160	how about you want to talk Lord British? What about his, uh, MMO Tabula Rasa? That's there's,
3781160	3786680	there you go. That was a stinker, um, for his resume too, even though obviously he's an all
3786680	3792040	time great and so forth, but, uh, yeah. Um, so anyway, I'm not, you know, it's a bummer though,
3792040	3797400	that it, all it took was like this one game and now Yuji Naka is like, eh, maybe I won't be doing
3797400	3803640	anything else for Square Enix, but I'm sure Square Enix saw this as being like a franchise. And
3803720	3808680	clearly that's not going to happen. Right. So, yeah, I still kind of want to play it.
3809560	3814200	Yeah. Well, and the good news for what it's worth is that it'll probably be very cheap to do so. Um,
3815800	3821000	it'll probably be a free game of the month on some services or a game pass thing or whatever
3821000	3825160	pretty well. Did it come out on Xbox? I can't even remember. Uh, it'll be, it'll be on all
3825160	3831800	sorts of those services pretty soon. All right. Anyhow, let's move on. Um, let's,
3831800	3836760	let's talk about things that went from bad to good. Yeah. I'm surprised to see that we're
3836760	3843000	still getting more updates. So like, this is like completely, we just had an update not that long
3843000	3850200	ago, but now of course, a hello game saying hello, here's yet another update. Um, so they released
3850200	3855560	prisms, which is a update for no man's sky that adds several different features of the game,
3855560	3861080	including some additional, uh, graphic improvements, including fur, uh, light
3861080	3866760	refraction in the rain, more details to the cave environments, reflective metal in space stations
3866760	3875000	and more also flying, um, pet mounts that you can get. And yeah, I mean, it just looks pretty cool.
3875000	3880040	I'm just surprised to see, like, like I thought we were at a point where like, yeah, this is
3880040	3884520	pretty good now. And now they're like, but you know what? It could be even better. Yeah. Right.
3885160	3889960	Um, and you look, I'm the resident, no man's sky fan boy here, I think in the house. And I played
3889960	3895560	this update a little bit. I'm kind of waiting on expedition three, you know, expedition two ended
3895560	3900120	with the big surprise that you unlock the Normandy, but we're in a low right now. There is no active
3900120	3903560	expedition. So you just have the base game right now. You can use all the rewards that you've done
3903560	3907160	through expeditions and stuff, but, um, that that's it. Right. So I'm kind of waiting on
3907160	3912760	expedition three to really jump back in, but I did look a little bit, um, at some of the changes.
3912840	3918200	Like I played for maybe like 30 minutes and yeah, they, they really enhance the space station with
3918200	3921800	like a better background. It looks really cool. And, uh, you know, when you're like,
3922600	3928040	walking on the floor and stuff, it's really, um, yeah, it does like, it's, you can notice some of
3928040	3932280	the visual updates. It looks really good, but the crazy part is, and Loki, you're kind of referring
3932280	3938120	to this, is that they just did a graphical update to this game in November. They, they just,
3938120	3943480	cause they did the big update to make it next gen, uh, from, or, you know, from PS4 type graphics
3943480	3948920	to PS5 type graphics. That was just in November. And now we're getting another big graphical
3948920	3953560	update. That's crazy. I really need to go back and play this game. I have it on PC,
3953560	3958520	never played it on PC, but like, I bet it was just like incredible now. Although the longer I wait,
3958520	3961880	the better it's going to look. So that's, I'll just wait a little bit longer, I guess.
3962520	3968360	Yeah. Uh, SSU100Matt in chat says, no man's sky is one of those great gaming comeback stories,
3968360	3973160	perhaps the greatest. And Miltonias Games in chat follows that up saying no man's sky and Final
3973160	3977320	Fantasy 14 are right up there for biggest turnaround. And yeah, I'd agree with that.
3977320	3981320	I mean, the only other thing I can think of that's nearly as big is Final Fantasy 14. And
3981320	3989240	I think what makes 14's trajectory unique is that 14 is still growing. It's still getting more and
3989240	3992680	more fans. And there was a very, you know, just a tangent a little bit, but you guys all know,
3992680	3996120	I follow Final Fantasy 14 stuff. There was a really interesting interview that just came
3996120	4002120	out with Yoshi P where he kind of talked about, they intentionally did not advertise during the
4002120	4007000	pandemic to make it look like they were capitalizing on the stay at home situation
4007000	4012360	and all that, which I thought was really, um, classy. Um, but at the same time, he didn't deny
4013400	4018840	that the game has been there for people in this whole, you know, COVID and quarantine time and
4018840	4023080	the pandemic and all that. So he sort of acknowledged, yes, it's helped the game,
4023080	4030680	but we've tried not to lean into that too much. Um, but you know, uh, not every video game grew
4030680	4035240	during the pandemic. Sure. Things like Animal Crossing did as well, but you know, for every
4035240	4039480	huge, you know, game that took off during the pandemic, there were still some stinkers.
4039480	4043080	We could talk about some games that didn't make that same turnaround. Hello, Anthem.
4043800	4049480	Oops. It was supposed to, but it didn't. Oops. Um, I would say the only other game that really
4049480	4053640	comes close that I can think of off the top of my head is Diablo 3, but I would, I mean,
4055080	4059560	and don't, I'm not trying to sell short Diablo 3's turnaround, which was huge. And it was probably
4059560	4064360	the first out of all these games. But, uh, I really think Final Fantasy 14 story and now No
4064360	4069960	Man's Sky story again is one for the history books, uh, as far as I'm concerned, which is
4069960	4076120	pretty cool. Huh? Uh, Mike Deaf says Super Mario Party with its online update. I don't think Super
4076120	4081720	Mario Party was quite as, um, raked over the coals as the other games when they first came out.
4082280	4088200	So, um, Miltonias Games pointing out Elder Scrolls Online also did good. That's true.
4088200	4092280	Elder Scrolls Online, I think also has their next big update, like what? June 15th. It's really
4092280	4097800	soon. That's another one I need to check out because I tried the beta back when it was like
4097800	4103960	first available and I just could not get into it. Like it just wasn't like, I like Elder Scrolls
4103960	4110760	and I can play it online. Sweet. But then, then I played them like, this isn't like Skyrim at all.
4110760	4116440	And then, so I just kind of like fell out of it, but like, maybe that I think it's still a game
4116440	4123480	pass. So maybe it is. It is. And, um, you know, again, not to, not to like belittle this comment,
4123480	4127000	you know, about Elder Scrolls Online, but one thing I do want to point out why it's not usually
4127000	4131320	said in the same breath. Look at the reviews with, when Elder Scrolls Online first came out
4131320	4136680	and when Final Fantasy 14 1.0 first came out. I don't think Elder Scrolls Online got rave reviews,
4137240	4144280	but it did not get completely shit on like Final Fantasy 14 1.0 did and deservedly so. And you guys
4144280	4151240	all know I'm a huge Final Fantasy 14 fan boy. 1.0 is the worst MMO I've ever played. It is fucking
4151240	4156280	terrible. Um, and it, that game went through a complete transformation. And so I think that's
4156280	4160520	why you don't often hear it in the same, you don't hear like Elder Scrolls Online in the same
4160520	4166120	breath, not to belittle or, uh, you know, uh, minimize the achievements that that game has
4166120	4171960	had over the years. But it went from, it's all right to, oh, neat. It's still going after all
4171960	4179000	these years. Whereas Final Fantasy 1.0 was like, this is fucking garbage, mom, to it's incredible.
4179000	4183560	And, you know, probably the biggest MMO out there right now. Like, I do think we're at a point
4183560	4189320	where Final Fantasy 14 is said more than WoW is. I think that's the reality, you know? So,
4189320	4192360	but I thought, again, there was a really cool interview with Yoshi P. I think it was the same
4192360	4197960	interview actually, where he kind of acknowledged Final Fantasy 14 would not have been reborn in
4197960	4203080	this way if it wasn't for WoW. And he says, I'm a Blizzard fan boy. I've been able to go to
4203080	4207640	Blizzard's campus like three times and I've had a great time every time. And I love talking to their
4207640	4214360	team and, and I love hearing how many people at Blizzard play the game. And, um, yeah. So
4214360	4219640	I think it's, I think it's great that there is that love between the two. Um, and maybe Blizzard
4219640	4223400	maybe is thinking maybe it's time for successor to World of Warcraft. I don't know. I don't know.
4223400	4228280	I'm, I'm probably getting ahead of myself. Yeah. And like, it might just be, I think,
4228840	4235560	and there's not, I think WoW has just lived its life, you know? And sure you come at me with the
4235560	4241240	EverQuest has 29 expansions or whatever. Sure. Fine. Yes. Yes. Like even, even with that though,
4241240	4246200	like eventually it has to end. I mean, it's just going forever. Cause it's just, it looks,
4246200	4252680	it starts to get dated. I mean like it, they want to put something out more modern to draw people
4252680	4257640	in. Let me rephrase. I think this says it better. World of Warcraft has peaked.
4258680	4261960	Final Fantasy 14 doesn't seem like it's peaked yet.
4261960	4269800	So, and this next expansion may make it even bigger. So I think that's the key difference.
4269800	4276120	So anyway, uh, all right. Uh, let's move on. I'm talking, I went from No Man's Sky to MMO chat,
4276120	4280280	but, uh, you know, these are, these are genres I'm passionate about. What can I say? Let's say,
4280280	4285080	Hey, a lot of people have passion for Nintendo as well. And what if you could visit an official
4285080	4289240	Nintendo museum? That sounds pretty rad, right? In fact, actually I think a lot of the reason
4289240	4293960	people love to go to the New York city store is that they have like, it's very, very, but it
4293960	4299000	feels like a Nintendo shrine of sorts. Yes. With lots and lots of merchandise to sell you,
4299000	4302840	but they have like those tiny little exhibits upstairs. Like, Oh, here's the game boy that
4302840	4307240	got destroyed in desert storm. Right. They have those things at the New York city store. Um,
4307240	4311400	I think a lot of people would love to see a actual large Nintendo museum and guess what?
4311400	4316680	One is coming. Uh, in about three years, you're going to get to visit a museum in Japan. So you
4316680	4321720	got to go there, but celebrating everything about Nintendo, they are going to be repurposing
4321720	4327720	an old factory into a gallery that will showcase consoles and other products that Nintendo has
4327720	4332200	launched throughout Nintendo's history. Uh, they're hoping to make it a tourist attraction.
4332200	4338200	So it's going to be the Uji Ogura plant, uh, and the surrounding land will be taking, uh,
4338200	4342520	taking that on. Uh, and I think this has to do they're, they're choosing this because the
4342520	4349080	Oguro station is also being, uh, re redeveloped in Japan. Um, so that's pretty cool. This is by
4349080	4354280	the way, right outside Kyoto. Um, and, uh, this is hopefully a way to bring back more tourists.
4354280	4358600	So that's pretty rad. Uh, this plant, by the way, used to manufacture playing cards and the
4358600	4364280	Hanafuda cards. Uh, and it was also a customer service site for product repairs. And so now,
4364280	4369160	this that's all moved to a newer factory. Uh, or are you showing some of those cards on stream
4369160	4374520	right now? Dark Sakura looks like, yeah, I have the Mario Hanahuda cards. You can order
4375240	4380840	them, um, actually on Nintendo's website. So the Nintendo gallery, uh, which is the early name for
4380840	4386520	this project, no word on when it will open yet, but they're targeting March, 2024. So that's
4386520	4393960	pretty exciting. Lots of stuff to, uh, visit in Japan in 2024. Um, the legend is Zaku and chat
4393960	4398840	says Japan done fucked up COVID after initially doing very well against it last year. I think
4398840	4404680	it's probably one of those things where it just, the surge didn't hit until later and it's, it's
4404680	4409960	unfortunate. It's probably going to ruin the Olympics. Yeah, it's, it is. You're, you're seeing
4409960	4415720	other countries now kind of going through it. Like obviously what, what happened in India is just
4417160	4422840	horrific. Words can't even describe it. India though did have a mass mismanagement. Um,
4423080	4430680	yeah, Japan actually being a society that already masks was really good in the beginning for holding
4430680	4437080	out. Um, it's just the way that they were dealing with vaccinations. I'm really glad we're starting
4437080	4441160	to pass off some of our surplus vaccinations to other parts of the world. I think that's a great
4441160	4447080	thing. It makes me, makes me happy to be an American when sometimes, especially in the last
4447080	4451640	four years, there were not, I wasn't always feeling that way when I got out of bed. So
4451640	4456920	that's great. All right. Um, let's move on. What do we have next? Dark Sagra.
4457960	4467480	Well, um, there is more law site law, lawsuit news. Um, Nintendo filed a lawsuit against a
4467480	4474760	ROM website called ROM universe and that was in 2019. Um, and it has since been concluded,
4474760	4480360	the judge has ruled in Nintendo's favor saying that ROM universe, and I'm going to quote,
4480360	4487480	is a straightforward video game piracy case, the, the, the situation. Um, and that the site was
4487480	4492200	quote populated the website with pirated copies of thousands of different Nintendo games and
4492200	4497720	distributed hundreds of thousands of copies of those pirated games because, uh, they also
4498440	4506200	sold paid premium accounts. So, um, so basically they were making money off of pirated material
4506200	4515320	instead of it just being like a free to download kind of thing. Um, so, uh, basically, um,
4515320	4521000	they, Nintendo was seeking over 15 million in copyright and trademark infringement damages.
4521720	4529320	Um, the company is going to be paying less than that. They ruled, uh, 35,000, uh, in statutory
4529320	4537960	damages for the 49 copyrights, uh, is enough. So they'll be paying 1.7 million. Um, Nintendo was
4537960	4545640	looking for 90,000 to per work. So this is better for the company, but, um, the total that they're
4545640	4552680	going to be receiving is 2,115,000. So don't sell ROMs.
4553000	4556200	Don't sell them, give them for free.
4557160	4561000	Which I guess this site, it kind of did that, but they had the subscription thing, right?
4563240	4567720	Uh, yeah, that was the thing. And they, they sold premium subscriptions.
4567720	4573880	Yeah. Yeah. Don't, don't make money off Nintendo. They have a way of finding you and,
4573880	4581000	and, uh, destroying you. Their, their fingers are up everyone's ass and not in a good way.
4581000	4585640	And I was going to say, I was going to say, not everybody's going to complain about that.
4585640	4587160	Anyway, Loki quick change the subject.
4588360	4594920	All right. Well, I mean, I'd like to change the subject, but, um, topic of ass we're
4594920	4603560	talking about the Atari VCS console coming out. Um, eh, yeah, it's finally out, I guess,
4603560	4609560	but I mean, I'm, I don't know. Um, it's coming out on the 15th of June. It's going to be
4609560	4614520	starting at $300, but apparently they have a version with a classic, you know,
4614520	4621160	Atari 26 under controller and you know, your modern controller for $400, um, be available
4621160	4630440	in retail soon. Is it any good? I don't know. It's like a PC, I guess, but I'm not all that
4630440	4635080	excited about it to be honest. I mean, the console is a cool shape, but it's just, it's basically
4635080	4641080	just a rising chip in there. So if I wanted one of those, I just build my own PC.
4642680	4648680	Any, uh, Atari VCS fans in the house and chat anybody, uh, pre-ordering their Atari VCS.
4648680	4653080	No, like, I, I know I'm sounding very, but I literally want to know, like,
4653080	4654840	what is motivating people to get this system?
4658120	4662840	Yeah. I mean, it's, I don't know. It's just not something I'm looking for. I like the case. I
4662840	4666440	like the design of it. It would have been cool if it was like a dedicated console that
4667000	4671960	they had more, you know, into it, but like, it sounded like it was just like a PC running
4671960	4675080	something that I think that's already available right now. They have like some Atari software
4675080	4680120	that's already available. You can play some of these classic games on, but I don't know.
4680120	4686120	It's just not as cool as it originally sounded. When's the Atari hotel coming? Let's talk about
4686120	4691560	something that's that's positive. Is it? I don't know. I figured the pandemic,
4691560	4696120	well, I figured the pandemic fucked it all up, but I'm, I'm still all about staying at the
4696120	4701800	Atari hotel. I mean, that does look pretty cool. And I mean, maybe I'll get to play a VCS at the
4701800	4707240	Atari hotel, the hotel, you know, they'll have it in each room. Uh, the hotel kind of looks more
4707240	4714280	like Tron than it does Atari hotel. I failed to see the problem. I don't, I'm not seeing that's
4714280	4719320	a bad thing. I'm saying that maybe they should lean that direction a little bit more than the
4719320	4725720	Atari thing. Um, yeah, it's coming in 2022 right now. So not yet, but yeah, I mean,
4725720	4730200	I figured the pandemic slowed those plans down, but yeah, it's way better than what the Hooters
4730200	4735960	hotel they have, or I know they have a hotel. It's all woodgrain and it's something trashy like that
4735960	4743640	pass. Yeah. All right. Moving on. Oh, pixel pockets clarifies the Hooters hotel is gone.
4744600	4750440	Oh, was it in Florida? This sounds like a Florida thing. No, no, no. It was in Vegas. Um, it's been
4750440	4755880	a long time since I've been to Vegas. It was on a business trip and I saw that when we were going to,
4755880	4763560	um, Oh gosh, what was it? Uh, to, to shoe company. Um, I don't remember, but they were going to,
4763560	4769400	they were going to buy games. Um, I remember this being a thing now. Yes. Zappos when we were going
4769400	4776920	to Zappos, uh, we drove past it and I was like, that looks trashy. I wonder what, I wonder what
4776920	4780840	turnover the casinos has happened in Vegas during the pandemic. Cause I know Hard Rock's gone.
4780840	4787240	It's now, it's now the Virgin hotel or something like that Richard Branson's, uh, Virgin. Um, so
4787240	4791080	I'm curious how that all probably looks at this point, but, uh, I wonder what other casino
4791080	4795800	turnovers have happened. I wonder if there will be an Atari, uh, casino in Vegas at some point,
4795800	4800200	who knows? Uh, Questbuster says there's a new mega hotel opening up next to the Wynn.
4800200	4806280	Where did they have room next to the Wynn? I guess I'm on top of each other. No,
4806280	4812200	that where the Stardust used to be, I think was, was, uh, still open. Maybe I, my memory's a little
4812200	4817240	fuzzy, but anyway. All right. Uh, let's move on this. Speaking of things from the past,
4817240	4823400	I think this is very interesting. Uh, we have Ken and Roberta Williams back in the news. Um,
4823400	4827720	you thought they were retired and, and quite frankly, so did they probably, but they got
4827720	4832040	bored. I have a feeling and, you know, Bobby talked a little bit about this on his show too,
4832040	4836040	but it is, it's, it's a thought I certainly had as well as that, you know what? Um,
4836040	4842200	they were probably ready to sail around the world, do the, you know, months long cruise,
4842200	4848200	go travel to all these different places and then up. Can't do that right now. Right. Bad idea.
4848200	4853240	So maybe we'll just get right back into making a video game or at least, you know, I don't
4853720	4857240	especially hearing about this project. I don't think they're like really getting in there the
4857240	4862760	way they used to with the classic Sierra online games, but even to see them contributing to a
4862760	4867000	newer game is, you know, it's a neat thought and a neat idea. It's just neat that we haven't seen
4867000	4872040	the last of Ken and Roberta Williams. So what the hell is going on? Let's, uh, talk about it.
4872040	4877960	They are working on a new game, uh, with a 3d artist, Marcus Maximus Mara. We don't know the,
4877960	4882440	uh, project title beyond something called the secret. We don't know if that's like actually
4882440	4887000	the name of the game. Uh, I would, I would hope this would not be confused with that book
4887000	4892920	that was on every talk show, uh, in what the two thousands. Right. So anyway, uh, this is a game
4892920	4899640	called the secret for now. Um, or it's just, you know, a secret. Um, there is a website that you
4899640	4905880	can visit. Uh, it's at kensgame.com. If you want to see more about it. Um, not a lot of details on
4905880	4909640	the game yet, but it talks about what's going on behind the scenes. What is it going to be?
4909640	4914680	A Sierra flavored or a Sierra inspired a Sierra, you know, a hint of Sierra game,
4914680	4921080	uh, single player game. Think things like King's quest. Larry, it's going to be an adventure game.
4921080	4926760	Modern audiences will be in mind though. And you know, they, they did a King's quest reboot. They
4926760	4932280	not Ken and Roberta, but they being another company did a King's quest reboot probably
4932280	4937560	about five years ago at this point. And it wasn't bad at all. I enjoyed it. I didn't play the whole
4937560	4941960	thing, but I played like the first episode, maybe a little bit of the second and I enjoyed it. Um,
4941960	4947640	so I think, you know, if it's something along those lines, Hey, I'm happy anyway. Um, especially,
4947640	4953000	you know, I would love to see Ken and Roberta Williams take on the walking SIM genre. I know
4953000	4958040	that that's sometimes used as a negative. I see walking SIM as a positive. There are so many good
4958040	4964040	games such as, you know, everybody's gone to the rapture, dear Esther, um, uh, what remains of
4964040	4968440	Edith Finch, you know, so many great games. Uh, I would love to see their take on that. I don't
4968440	4972920	know if that's going to be this cause it's going to be a little more Sierra inspired, but, uh,
4972920	4977800	yeah, who knows, who knows where this could actually end up going. Um, they've been developing
4977800	4982680	this game over the past six months. They do. They are warning you on the game's website that
4982680	4987160	Roberta's involvement has been kind of minimal, but she's supposed to be getting more involved
4987160	4993080	as they get closer to release. So I don't really know what that actually means. It sounds like
4993080	4997640	maybe she's not doing the bulk of the writing, but maybe she's contributing ideas, plot twists,
4997640	5002760	things like that. I don't know. Um, we'll see as this develops, their goal is to release the game
5002760	5007320	in November, but they're still working with placeholder graphics. And so I have a feeling
5007320	5010200	this is not going to be, and most people have a feeling this isn't actually going to happen
5010200	5016120	this year. Um, but maybe demos and screenshots at a later date. Um, supposedly another contributor
5016120	5022120	on this project as well. They haven't named yet. Um, so I don't know, again, don't think that like
5022200	5026520	they're building a game from the ground up, like they did in the eighties and nineties,
5026520	5030520	because video games aren't made today. Like they were made in the eighties and nineties, right?
5030520	5035160	It wasn't uncommon for one person to make a game in the eighties and nineties. Now it takes a team
5035160	5038680	of people. And I know what you're thinking. Yeah, there are plenty of ways for one per,
5038680	5042600	what about Axiom Verge? What about Pixel Poops? And there's plenty of games that one person can
5042600	5047480	make, but I think to fit their vision and what they want to do, they're going to need more than
5047480	5051560	just them to do it. So I think they're really kind of just contributing, you know, and, uh,
5051560	5056200	just not really leaving gaming behind, especially in the face of a pandemic and what's going on
5056200	5060680	with that. So, um, but I'll still play it. That's for sure. I'll check it out.
5062520	5070280	I think they're great. Um, looking in chat over at twitch.tv slash a vog network, uh,
5070280	5074200	Dr. Sia says, I'm tempted to start some of the older games because I got a hold of some of them
5074200	5078680	for free. Like the space and police quest games missed them back in the eighties and nineties
5078680	5084120	didn't get a PC till way past all of that. Just keep in mind, a lot of your modern conveniences
5084120	5088680	and adventure games, aren't going to necessarily be present, especially in the early, early Kings
5088680	5093640	quest games. It didn't start to get a little more graphical to like Kings quest for, um, was when
5093640	5098760	the interface really changed. So just, just keep that in mind. Um, and you can skip the last Kings
5098760	5104840	quest game, just, you know, all right. Yeah. Quest buster and chat says on Rob's note,
5104840	5110680	early adventure games love to kill the player, but that was kind of the fun. I mean, I know people
5110680	5115480	hate dying in games and having to start over, but it was kind of fun to see all the creative shit
5115480	5119560	that they'd kill your character with in those games. And it wasn't graphic or anything, you
5119560	5124600	know, it was a fantasy. It was just, you know, a lot of it was implied. So something to think
5124600	5130760	about there. All right. Um, let's move on. So this is going to be a fun surprise for people,
5130760	5135240	I think, because we have a fresh coat of paint on a very familiar segment. So let's get into it.
5145960	5151640	And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time or I'll dive into the vault and pull out
5151640	5156360	a classic and tell you about it. It's time for the classic game of the week.
5163320	5165560	All right. And what is the classic game of the week?
5170040	5170840	Jamie, you're muted.
5174920	5178840	Then no one heard me say, Oh, fuck. Oh, wait, you did. Um, no, I didn't hear it either. You're
5178840	5183800	muted on discord. That's right. The classic game is portal two. Um, yes, it is that old.
5185320	5195640	You're welcome. So, um, at any rate, uh, portal two came out in 2011 in, uh, I want to say
5197160	5204760	April. So yes, it is, uh, 10. It is, uh, it's 10 years old.
5205240	5214680	Yep. You, you all should feel oldish. Um, so it was released, uh, by valve for windows,
5214680	5224520	Mac OS 10, Linux, uh, PlayStation three and X-Box three 60. Um, the digital version was, uh,
5224520	5232760	distributed online by valves steam service and the other retail, uh, additions were by electronic
5233640	5242520	arts. So basically it is a, uh, an update of the original portal with a lot more silliness.
5243240	5248440	Um, you, the one portal of one color, you come out through the portal of another color
5249240	5255960	and, uh, however, and by the way, you're still are, are, uh, controlling Chell, who is, uh,
5256600	5264120	the test subject. And she has been asleep for some time and was woken up by a robot or a, uh,
5264120	5272520	I guess he's a core really, um, named Wheatley who is voiced by Steven merchant. Um, and so, uh,
5273240	5280520	you go through the game and you start to discover other things, uh, other types of puzzles that were
5280520	5285640	being created and you, I mean, it's, it's 10 years. I'll go ahead and spoil it. Glados is
5285640	5291880	a potato. So you go around and you listen to old recordings of cave Johnson, which are absolutely
5291880	5298680	hilarious and brilliant. Um, and of course we have Jonathan Golden still doing, uh, the end
5298680	5308920	song for the game. Um, the other thing about this one too, is, uh, it had a bunch of AR games, uh,
5309880	5318840	that promoted it, including one called, uh, potato stack where, sorry, potato sack where, um,
5321080	5328360	you had to solve puzzles, uh, that showed up in, uh, in these different 13 updates. So, um,
5329880	5336200	but going back to this portal to also, uh, had other things going on for it. So we're
5336200	5342360	going to start back off with, you know, the essence of portal speedy thing goes in speedy
5342360	5352280	thing goes out. It's physics. Um, so, uh, Oh, and yes, uh, uh, cave Johnson was, uh,
5352280	5360440	voiced by J K Simmons who, uh, we might also know as J Jonah Jamison from our, uh, McGuire era
5360440	5366520	Spider-Man movies. I believe so. Um, modern Spider-Man, the modern ones. Okay. Yeah. I
5366520	5370760	thought it was a other era because this goes to show, I haven't seen a single one of the new ones.
5370760	5379240	Um, so anyway, um, you have, uh, many different elements in this one apart from just, you know,
5379240	5389080	the, uh, the, the weighted storage cubes and the portal guns and, um, the, uh, you know,
5389080	5396520	the portals themselves, what you have are thermal discouragement beams, which are lasers,
5397240	5403560	um, excursion funnels, which are tractor beams and hard light bridges that you can all direct
5403560	5411800	through your portals. Aerial faith plates exist as well, which can launch you or objects into
5411800	5416520	portals. Basically you just throw them on there. You do still have the turrets and they are still
5416520	5424120	adorable. Um, as far as those redesigned weighted storage cubes, you now have redirection cubes
5424120	5430120	that are prismatic and let you redirect the thermal discouragement beams. Um, you have
5430120	5441160	spherical edgeless safety cubes, um, which are basically round storage cubes, um, and a poor,
5441240	5451000	poor cube turret hybrid that Wheatley made and prominently fucked up on. Um, you also do have
5451000	5459320	a return of the weighted companion cube. Um, you also have, um, pneumatic diversity vents,
5460440	5468120	um, that have, uh, transport power, basically suction or transport. Um, those were actually
5468120	5476760	in the demo, but were not included in the final game. Um, as far as other things that you get,
5476760	5485640	um, again, this is something that was, uh, inspired by, uh, uh, by, uh, other games and tech
5485640	5491320	demos. I'll have to get into that in a second, but you get the various kinds of gels. So you have an
5491320	5497800	orange propulsion gel that will let you slide across surfaces quickly. You have repulsion gel
5497800	5506360	that makes you bounce and white conversion gel that allows a surface to accept portals because,
5506360	5517720	um, ground up, uh, moon rocks are poison and now he's deathly ill. Um, you have, uh, you also have
5517720	5525160	the various funnels that you can use to make it go across in the air or go, um, you know,
5525160	5533000	through the ground, um, like pull one, one direction versus the other. Uh, and then we also
5533000	5546120	have the addition of multiplayer. So, um, so you can in single player, you can play Chell, um, who
5546120	5553320	is the main protagonist. Um, there was also a rumor that there was supposed to be like a sister
5553400	5560360	character for her who was supposed to be blonde. Um, that did not happen. Um,
5562040	5571320	so this takes us then to cooperative mode. So with cooperative mode, you can play as one of two
5571320	5578840	robots. Um, and see, this is where the, the Chell clone was supposed to come from. Um, so you have,
5578840	5587240	uh, two new robots, you have, uh, Atlas and Peabody as in P dash body. And they do also
5587240	5594520	make a cameo in the single player, uh, campaign. If you are quick and you have to be quick to see
5594520	5603400	them. Um, but you, you have like signals and pings and stuff, you know, which actually I wonder if
5603400	5607480	that's kind of where dead by daylight might've gotten some of that or from journey, maybe
5607480	5612440	where since survivors can't really talk to each other unless you're, you know, in discord or
5612440	5620600	something, you signal things so they can ping each other and signal, um, to state their intent. Um,
5622120	5629800	their, the writing in this is absolutely astounding. I mean, it's so good. So good.
5629800	5640440	Voice acting is so good. Um, the, the only thing, um, that there was a problem going on is that
5640440	5646920	there was a very, and I'm just going to say it out, Raul, a very, uh, rapey scene that, um,
5648040	5653560	it actually was voiced, uh, Ellen McClain did her, her part of it as GLaDOS. Well, not as GLaDOS,
5653560	5663080	but as, uh, um, why can't I think of her name, um, as the human person that GLaDOS is based off of,
5663720	5674120	um, like for like just a moment, my brain absolutely cannot remember her name anyway.
5674200	5684680	Um, but at any rate, um, uh, the cave Johnson lines, um, basically, uh, JK Simmons refused
5684680	5695240	to record them. Um, so that's very, uh, very cringy. Um, why can't I remember her name?
5697960	5701640	This is going to really bother me now because I can't remember her name.
5702280	5708760	Mike Deft is suggesting Miranda. No, it's not Miranda. It's, um, okay, screw it. I'm going
5708760	5716120	to look up her name. Uh, looking at chat for some other comments, um, tiger claw pointing out portal
5716120	5719960	two was one of the first games that was kind of cross platform. You buy the PlayStation three
5719960	5724680	version and it gives you the PC version and you sign into your steam account in the PC or PS3
5724680	5728120	version. Yeah. I remember that. That was really cool. So the only game that did that.
5728120	5738200	Okay. So, um, so get ready to catch me. It still is not, uh, she was, um, Caroline.
5740200	5746040	That was your name was Caroline. Yep. Yep. Um, and I knew it didn't start with an M.
5747400	5756280	Um, but at any rate, I mean, it's just so well done and I love Stephen merchant so much,
5756280	5763720	especially as, uh, um, Wheatley, I mean, it just made everything. Everything was so wonderful
5763720	5773880	about that game. Um, so, um, it also has been used, um, in education, uh, believe it or not.
5773880	5779880	Um, there was called teach with portals and steam for school that use portal to,
5779880	5786200	important to puzzle maker for education. Um, it was free, but it had a single player campaign
5786200	5793720	and puzzle maker was only for steam for school users. Um, so it was teaching how to solve puzzles
5793720	5801720	and create critical thinking. Although some people were, um, upset with the whole quote,
5801720	5809480	gamification of learning. So, um, and they, uh, there was also research in 2016 that demonstrated
5809480	5815560	that the portal to puzzle maker can be used to measure fluid intelligence. Um, so, and it was
5815560	5825480	referred to as the portal to test battery. Hmm. So that was also pretty neat. Um, it was, I mean,
5825480	5832680	it, it sold amazingly well people to this day still love and play it. Um, and it actually
5833480	5842680	was subject to, um, some mods. Um, so remember I was saying that Chell was supposed to have
5842680	5849960	like a twin or a clone or something. Her name was Mel. And so, um, someone did portal stories, Mel,
5850680	5859880	um, where they did, uh, a mod for portal where you could have Mel and Chell. Um,
5859880	5865640	there's aperture tag, the paint gun testing initiative, where it's a single player
5865640	5873160	modification, um, that basically replaces the portal gun with a gel gun. Um, that makes it
5873160	5878840	kind of like tag, the power of paint, which tag, the power of paint is where those gels were
5878840	5885320	originated. Um, and that game may come up cause I've done an arbacular drop. So, um, there's also
5885320	5893240	thinking with time machine, um, which is, uh, a, uh, mod that gives you the ability to record
5893240	5898840	actions that can be played back by a duplicate player, um, and allows for the use of a second
5898840	5903320	set of portals. And then there's portal reloaded, which is, um, a single player mod for portal two,
5904040	5910440	um, that came out on my birthday this year, cause the game came out on my birthday in, uh,
5910440	5917880	10 years ago. And it lets you use a third portal called the time portal to travel between the
5917880	5928360	present and future versions of each test chamber. And so on that note, I will say that portal two
5929080	5935480	deserves its place as a classic game and is still among one of my favorite modern classics.
5936120	5942760	I think it was definitely just a matter of when this game would be eligible, which it may be the
5942760	5948040	biggest surprise in this segment is that yes, this game is 10 years old and you are 10 years older.
5950040	5955240	Uh, and it's now eligible. It came out on my birthday. Yeah. Uh, and just somebody in chat
5955240	5961240	pointed out, uh, it was, uh, who said it? Uh, Oh yeah. Mike Deaf said, by the way, portal two
5961240	5966280	launched during that big Sony hack. Yeah. This was during that period when, um, PlayStation three,
5966280	5972600	uh, it was offline, I think for a pretty good chunk of the period. Um, you know, I do have
5972600	5979800	potato potatoes quotes. Okay. Um, still as my ring, ringtones on, uh, on my phone,
5980360	5987160	like my favorite one, look at you flying like an E flying majestically like an Eagle piloting a
5987160	5996120	blimp. Glados is the queen of reads the queen of the shady read. The library is always open with
5996120	6001240	her. You know, uh, thank you for bringing portal to, of course, this is the game we talked about.
6001240	6004520	I mean, it's funny cause you know, the show has been around long enough where we talked a lot
6004520	6008200	about this game when it came out and somebody in chat reminded us, this was our game of the year
6008200	6015960	in 2011. Like obviously, um, this is an amazing game. I have to say what, why, why will, why won't
6015960	6021000	valve do portal three? It's so disappointing that they won't do a third game because they
6021000	6027720	can't count to three. I, I get, I realize this is valves mo, but I mean, I love this game in a way
6027720	6032040	that, you know, I don't have the same feelings about like, you know, half life and stuff like
6032040	6037640	that, that, which yes, I realize this has been awful, but I don't have, you know, this is the
6037640	6042120	one I really want to see a three of. And it's just, it's, it's blows my mind that yeah, at
6042120	6048440	least there was a half-life Alex, which is for some folks is a half-life three. When are we ever
6048440	6057560	going to see this series continue? Well, and we, we, uh, I just think that, uh, I almost said
6057560	6065080	aperture. Um, I think valve needs to go talk to whoever at Capcom learned how to count to three
6065080	6074120	and teach them how to count. If Capcom could do it, so can valve. Uh, orange, right. And chat
6074120	6078760	says portal VR wouldn't work. No, I absolutely agree with that. Uh, and I realized, you know,
6078760	6083880	a lot of valves interests, oh, make everybody vomit. Like, you know, even I enjoy VR and,
6083880	6088040	and it would still make me vomit. Like it would be too much. Would totally play it. I would totally
6088040	6093000	play it. And I, you know, you know, I'm sure somebody's already modded the first two games
6093000	6100600	to work with VR, um, have fun, but you know, not, not so much for me. Um, but yeah, it's just,
6100600	6107160	it's so sad that, you know, I don't know, maybe they just figured they cannot top this game.
6107160	6112360	And I suppose that's something I just have to accept as a fan is that they cannot top this game.
6112920	6118040	And so they're not going to try. And it's that, but it's just, damn, I really wish this,
6118040	6127320	this universe could continue, you know? Yeah. Uh, Bobby does say there is a officially endorsed
6127320	6135960	portal VR game. It's portal, a portal stories VR. So. All right. And it is not portal.
6137960	6141880	It's just endorsed. All right. Uh, but anyway, yeah, I'd love to see a full portal three,
6141880	6146840	but I think I just kind of have to accept, uh, valve does not feel this can ever be talked. And
6146840	6151240	I guess that is that. So, all right. But great pick for the classic game of the week.
6151240	6155960	Love portal to love the original love this one, uh, portal to your classic game of the week.
6155960	6162840	Yes. It's 10 years old. All right. You're welcome. Uh, tiger claw does also remind us,
6162840	6168600	uh, a few weeks ago, I read that JJ Abrams said a portal movie is in the works. I remember hearing
6168600	6175960	about that recently too. Um, I believe nothing until I see it. I think the fandom is going to
6175960	6182360	be very irritated when Ella McLean is not the voice of GLaDOS. Like, I think there's just a
6182360	6188360	lot of fans. If she is, then I think we have a different conversation. Absolutely. But I think
6188360	6192520	there's a lot of people that are going to reject this movie when they put some AAA actress as the
6192520	6197400	voice of GLaDOS instead, but we'll see. I don't know. Maybe they will. Hey, if they did get Ella
6197400	6204520	McLean to do it, I'd be thrilled. She deserves it. I do have to point out when we got the
6204600	6210040	transformers movie, who else was our optimist prime? Yeah, it was Leonard Nimoy, right?
6210600	6219160	No, Leonard Nimoy was Galvatron in the animated movie. I'm talking about the more recent ones.
6220200	6224040	I forget who did do it. Was it, uh, not Frank Welker.
6228360	6233240	Well, who did my headphones go out? I think, I think so. Who did do it? I don't know.
6233800	6242360	You brought it up. No, it was Peter Cullen. Oh, that's right. Frank Welker was someone else.
6243800	6249080	Oh, Dark Tetsuya does remind, they got her to be in Pacific Rim, right? Oh yeah. I forgot that
6249080	6255080	was a thing, but you know, it'll be interesting to see if they, but I just, I cannot envision GLaDOS
6255080	6259880	without Ella McLean. I just can't do it. And I know this happens in Hollywood all the time that
6259880	6266360	they would recast it, but I just, I don't know. So, all right. Anyhow. All right. Thank you for
6266360	6270200	the classic Game of the Week. We've talked plenty about Portal, but it is such a good game. Let's
6270200	6274280	get into some rapid fire news, travel around the world and quickly check out some other headlines
6274280	6283080	from around the globe. Loki. All right. So there's been a delay with another game because of COVID
6283080	6288120	and this game of course is going to be King of Fighters 15, which is delayed now to 2022.
6288840	6293320	And I mean, this is, we've heard this a million times already, but
6293320	6296040	yet another one you'll have to wait a little bit longer for.
6298360	6303080	This is pretty cool. So relatively new game. EA has this game called Knockout City,
6303080	6308840	which is a massive multiplayer kind of a dodge ball game. And they've already seen
6308840	6312920	5 million account signups across all their platforms since launch,
6313800	6317480	which is pretty impressive considering it launched, you know, not that long ago.
6317480	6320600	I have some friends that talk about this game a lot and want me to play it. I just haven't gotten
6320600	6324280	around to it yet, but I probably will check it out. Aside from the trailer that we saw during
6324280	6329480	that one Nintendo Direct, I haven't really checked it out yet. It is apparently on Games Pass as
6329480	6334600	well. So that's one way to check it out. Oh yeah. Cause EA play is on Game Pass. So that's one way
6334600	6340200	to check it out. So yeah, I need to get around to anybody in chat playing this game. Part of that
6340200	6346840	5 million. Legend of Zaku says it's the next Fortnite. It might be that next, I don't know,
6346920	6351400	Fortnite is going to kind of always do its own thing, I think. Because Fortnite, remember,
6351400	6355480	Fortnite isn't a game. Remember? There was that whole thing that came out of the recent,
6355480	6363320	you know, headlines of Epic and all that. I think that there's games that kind of come and go with
6363320	6368200	the popular, like Fall Guys, Among Us. And not to say those games aren't still popular. There's
6368200	6371880	lots of people that love them, but they certainly, right, they were the front page, Twitch and all
6371880	6375480	that stuff. And I think Knockout City is kind of like, if it's not there yet, it's going to be one
6375480	6380680	of those big games pretty soon here as more and more people are checking it out. So.
6382360	6387640	Bonz006 says, I see the game, but and a Knockout City. Pastelpaca says, I've played it a bit. It's
6387640	6393640	fun, but in regards to dodgeball inspired games, I prefer Robot Roller Derby Disco Dodgeball. See,
6393640	6398120	nothing is going to top the Kunio Kun Super Dodgeball for me. That's just the reality.
6398920	6401880	That will always be the best dodgeball game. You're not going to be able to change my mind.
6402840	6408120	The Neo Geo, I mean, they had the NES one as well, which is all right. But the Neo Geo one is like
6408120	6414280	classic. So. All right. That's the whole reason to get a Neo Geo cabinet is play that game again.
6414280	6423480	All right. Anyhow. Sorry. I digress. Dark Saga. So for Pride Month, the game Tell Me Why is free
6423800	6431960	on Steam. So for the entire month of June, you can go download it so that you can experience
6433720	6442200	the story for yourself of one of the characters in the game is transgender. And so it will,
6442840	6448120	it's good to sort of put yourself in that person's shoes, especially since this has been
6448120	6457080	this year so far, there have been more than 100 bills passed restricting the rights of
6457080	6463400	transgender people. So definitely give this one a play. I believe it may also be free in the Xbox
6463400	6466520	ecosystem as well, because I was looking at the store the other day and it said, but I don't know
6466520	6473480	if that was a game pass thing, but just a heads up, it may be free there as well. Okay. And then
6473960	6480920	Arcade went up, put out a teaser, a very pixelated pink sprinkled donuts,
6482120	6491080	which is basically a big reference to them doing a Simpsons game. So you wanted Simpsons 4 player,
6491080	6499240	you're getting Simpsons 4 player. And Simpsons is on there. The other games that were in the
6499240	6503320	leak that we talked about what a couple of weeks ago, two weeks ago when we were last live, yeah,
6503320	6508120	probably going to be included. We'll see, which was Tron and PAW Patrol, which I'm sure some
6508120	6517240	people are very excited about, but also breaking news before OLR tonight. Bobby caught this on his
6517240	6523320	show is that apparently the entire YouTube trailer for the Simpsons machine leak. So it's,
6523320	6528920	it's happening. The Simpsons machine is absolutely 100% happening. The YouTube is out there.
6529720	6536200	You can't, no take backsies on that one. Now we are inferring that because, well, the leak for the
6536200	6542680	Simpsons was true then also, but we don't have a full YouTube yet for the Tron thing, but Arcade
6542680	6548360	went up is one of the virtual exhibitors at E3. So this would be a great time for them to put out
6548360	6553960	that trailer in this next couple of weeks. So fingers and toes. Well, I mean, I'm already kind
6553960	6558920	of like, you know, having my God damn it moment because, you know, I'm going to have to shell out
6558920	6564600	the money for that cabinet, but I'm not going to lie. I want that fucking cabinet. So there you
6564600	6570200	have it. Well, you know what else leaked out though on Twitter with all that stuff. Apparently
6570200	6577000	there is a countertop. So it's the smaller machine, but a super Pac-Man. Now super Pac-Man is in like
6577000	6582440	the Pac-Man 40th edition cabinet or all that stuff. But I love me some super Pac-Man. I'm
6582440	6585720	almost tempted to get that countertop, to be honest. I don't even know what other games are in it.
6586680	6594280	But at least the countertops are smaller. So there is that. Yeah. Fifth Dream in chat says,
6594280	6598920	I really want to get that Tron machine and really LED it up. Yeah. Those like, you know,
6598920	6605880	you know who is really attracted to the lights on the cabinets is Mr. Smoosh, my cat. So I actually
6605880	6611480	had grandpa from Hoard House was over here at the house over the weekend. We were hanging out for a
6611480	6616120	little bit and I was showing him the arcade cabinet because it'd been so long since he'd
6616120	6621160	been here, right? Cause the pandemic, I got that machine about a year ago when the pandemic was in
6621160	6625640	full swing for my birthday. So I showed him the cabinet and I turned it on. And as soon as the
6625640	6630520	light on that machine went on, I hadn't turned it on in a while. As soon as it turned on, Mr. Smoosh
6630520	6635560	was in Matt's lap. And then all of a sudden Smoosh like looks at the machine, his eyes get gigantic.
6635560	6640840	And then he like hops his way over to the machine and jumps up on the controls to like press his
6640840	6648200	face against the LED screen. Like I guess Mr. Smoosh loves himself in arcade cabinets. So
6648200	6651080	he's going to have two of them pretty soon when that Tron one shows up.
6651800	6658120	So yeah, he just better not ruin that special Tron joystick. Cause you know, you can't have
6658120	6662280	the Tron machine without that special joystick. I don't even know what to call it. I have like
6662280	6669240	that trigger finger thing is very cool. Yeah. All right. Yeah. It's that thing. That thing,
6669240	6673320	the Tron joystick. All right. Let's travel around the world and check out release dates.
6673320	6676040	I think I heard we have a big week this week, right? Loki?
6677240	6682600	We have a few things coming out. So it looks like we've got Chivalry 2 on PC, PlayStation
6682600	6690280	4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One and Xbox Series X, Edge of Eternity on PC, Neptunia Reverse
6690280	6696920	on PlayStation 5, Alba, A Wildlife Adventure on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5,
6696920	6703480	Xbox One and Xbox Series X, No More Heroes and No More Heroes 2, Desperate Struggle coming to
6703480	6711000	PC. We have Phantasy Star Online, New Genesis, I'm sorry, Phantasy Star Online 2, New Genesis,
6711000	6717720	coming out on PC, Xbox One and Xbox Series X in North America and PC, Nintendo Switch and
6717720	6726280	PlayStation 4 in Japan. Chicory, A Colorful Tale on PC, Mac, PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5.
6727560	6735400	Looks like we've got Final Fantasy 7 Remake Integrate on PlayStation 5, Ninja Gaiden Master
6735400	6742360	Collection on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. Nintendo Switch is getting Game
6742360	6750360	Builder Garage, Guilty Gear Strive on PC, PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5, Ratchet and
6750360	6758920	Clank Rift Apart on PlayStation 5. And I believe that's everything. All right, let's go to Japan
6758920	6763800	right now. Pack your bags. Coming out of Japan this week, Game Builder Garage also gets a release
6763800	6770040	in Japan this week. And that Ninja Gaiden Master Collection is also out in Japan this week. Those
6770040	6775640	both on the Nintendo Switch, of course. Looking at PlayStation 5, Japan also gets the Final Fantasy
6775640	6779000	7 Remake Integrate. Of course, you know, it's going to be the same time we get it here in the
6779000	6784600	US. That shouldn't be a big surprise to anybody. Also, Ratchet and Clank Rift Apart also getting
6784600	6789320	its Japanese release. Guilty Gear Strive also coming out this week. This is really one of those
6789320	6793800	rare weeks where it's like the release calendar is like exactly the same between the two countries,
6793800	6799000	to be honest. It's very similar. And then PlayStation 4 also has Guilty Gear Strive this
6799000	6803640	week. So check it out. How about Europe? I imagine it's going to be a broken record, but let's see.
6803640	6808200	How about Europe, DarkSakura? Yeah, pretty, pretty light. So on the 8th,
6808200	6815880	we have Descenders. We have Elder Scrolls Online Blackwood, Chivalry 2. On the 10th,
6815880	6821640	we have Tour de France 2021. We are Football, which is actual football and not American football.
6822680	6829000	Final Fantasy 7 Remake Integrate. And on the 11th, we have the Persistence Enhanced,
6829560	6832920	Ratchet and Clank Rift Apart and Guilty Gear Strive.
6837000	6842760	All right, that's it. That's it. All right, let's move on. And we appropriately after what
6842760	6846440	Loki had said earlier tonight, I think Loki is going to update us on the Minecraft world, right?
6847320	6855240	Yeah, I actually follow this up a lot. So one of the more popular streamers and speed runners is
6855320	6863240	Dream. And not that long ago, he was accused of cheating in Minecraft speed runs, because
6863960	6870680	the percentage. So one of the strats that they use for speedrunning in Minecraft 116 now is the
6870680	6875800	Piglin Bartering, which you can drop gold in front of a Piglin, they'll, you know, trade you some
6875800	6884840	random item, and they use that to get ender pearls. And so he had manipulated the game in a way,
6884840	6890920	or the alleged, you know, they alleged originally that he manipulated the basically the randomness
6890920	6897240	of that. So he increased the percentage chance drop by modifying loop tables to drop those ender
6897240	6905320	pearls more often. And so then he denied it originally. And, you know, put out this long winded
6906920	6912040	analyst video where he had a statistician look at, you know, everything in the game and said,
6912040	6917000	Oh, no, it's not impossible that the percentage drops that he got, but it was like it was
6917000	6921320	ridiculous. Like he would be like the most luckiest person in the world to have that kind of
6921320	6930600	luck in the games. Well, come to find out, he admitted to in a pay spin saying that, yep, he
6930600	6937000	did cheat. He did put or create a modification to allow him to have better drops on those.
6937640	6943240	But he was using it for some other types of runs, like for his manhunt series and stuff like that.
6944520	6952440	But he accidentally left it on for six of his live streams for his speed runs. So
6954440	6962520	accidentally did that. But then, of course, you know, so I don't know, it's just ridiculous.
6963080	6966200	I don't know why he needed to do that. He's already a great speed runner.
6966920	6971960	Granted, he's not going to be he doesn't have the top spots anymore because they've been taken down.
6971960	6979000	But but just kind of ruins his credit. It's one of those things where he didn't know what to do
6979000	6982680	and he wasn't the best anymore. And it's unfortunate. You kind of hear these stories
6982680	6989080	sometimes where somebody is trying to well, you know, it's without going too late. I'm going to
6989080	6993240	open this can of worms. It's a lot of the accusations around the Billy Mitchell thing,
6994040	6999080	right? He's also pretty young. Oh, yeah, for sure. But I mean, it's a similar type of thing
6999080	7003640	when it's like if you believe Billy Mitchell is lying about everything. I'm not going there
7003640	7009160	tonight, but it's then you would say that it's a similar thing where if, you know, when you're
7009160	7013000	when you're not number one in the world anymore, you don't know what else to do and you have to
7013000	7019080	cheat to get your way back to number one. Right. Exactly. Look, look, look at the former president
7021640	7026360	willing to cheat to try to get back anyway. Yeah, I know. I know.
7027880	7031960	So originally, like they're saying, you know, the odds of like what he got was like something
7031960	7037720	that one points one in seven point five trillion odds. Obviously, that's ridiculous. But,
7038520	7045160	uh, you know, it is what it is. It's weird, though, like now he's also like taking down
7045160	7049640	that post. But obviously, people saw it in the Internet. So once it's on the Internet,
7049640	7054920	it's always on the Internet. Just weird. But yeah, that's just that's your that's catching
7054920	7062840	you up on your your Minecraft speedrunning drama there in non speedrunning drama. So Minecraft is
7062840	7068280	actually removed a shout out to 4chan because you may remember when you started Minecraft,
7068280	7072360	they have kind of little blurbs in the near the logo talking just like little funny things in
7072360	7080360	there. Well, one of them apparently had, you know, kind of a mention of V on there or movie
7081240	7086440	because that's one of the sub channels for 4chan. So they have now removed that from the game as
7086440	7092440	well. One other bigger update, though, 1.17, the brand new version is actually coming out on
7092440	7096680	Tuesday, which is pretty exciting. So they're adding lots of updates to that. Originally,
7096680	7102520	caves and cliffs was supposed to be a lot bigger and redesigning the whole cave generation into
7102520	7107480	the game. But it's a massive undertaking that they're actually splitting up into multiple
7107480	7112440	releases. So this next release is just adding some more blocks, adding some new mobs and stuff like
7112440	7121400	or new, I guess, passive mobs in the game. But 1.18 is going to like completely redesign the
7121400	7125320	cave generation stuff. It's going to be ridiculous, but that's not supposed to come out to holiday,
7125320	7130680	but still pretty cool. Yeah. When's when series X supposed to get some of those graphical upgrades
7130680	7134120	that like the Nvidia stuffs beginning? Because like when I watch your stream and like the water
7134120	7138840	effects and stuff, I'm like Dan or your your YouTube's water. I love the look of that. And
7138840	7145240	it's not in the series X version. No, that's OptiFine and BSL shaders. So that's included
7145240	7151400	with OptiFine usually. And it really doesn't take much to run that. It looks so nice.
7152840	7159160	Really like the way it looks. It does break some plugins I have like that. I if I wanted to do
7159160	7163800	different visualizations like they have stuff where you can, you know, for building farms and
7163800	7168120	things like that, you can see what the spawn area is and it will generate like a sphere around you
7168120	7172120	and stuff like that. I can't see any of that if I because I'm playing with shaders on,
7172760	7175720	I would have to switch it off. But I just don't use those.
7177000	7183320	All right. Let's move on and talk about this is a little more in the rumor category,
7183320	7188200	but this has been a source of spoilers before and I'm talking about Walmart Canada.
7188200	7193960	Remember when they completely ruined E3 one year? I think that was what, 2019? They completely
7193960	7199080	ruined E3, Walmart Canada with all these releases. Well, who knows if they're trolling
7199080	7205720	or what's going on? I don't know, but here it is. A listing popped up this week for Metroid on the
7205720	7212440	Nintendo Switch. And obviously it had fake box art. It wasn't real. It was literally like black
7212440	7217320	text that said Metroid on a white box, but it was there. There is no Metroid game on the Nintendo
7217320	7222440	Switch right now. It is interesting to note they didn't call it Metroid Prime 4. The reason why
7222440	7227160	I bring this up, there were already rumors, but we really kind of filed those in the,
7227160	7231720	okay, y'all, this is like, like, I don't even know if I believe this, but people are saying
7231720	7236440	that there may be a new 2D Metroid game that is locked, loaded, ready to go for Nintendo Switch,
7236440	7242440	and it's getting announced at E3. Some rumors say it's a Super Metroid remake in the vein of
7242440	7249240	Metroid Zero Mission. I love Metroid. I love 2D Metroid. I'm not holding my breath or setting
7249240	7257160	expectations because this is the rumor they try to get you with every time, but Walmart Canada
7257160	7263240	doing this just to troll, I don't know if I buy that either. This is a little bit, there's smoke
7263240	7269240	here and there might be a fire. How very un-Canadian of them. Exactly. Exactly. That
7269240	7276360	would not be very Canadian of them to pull a stunt like this. How very. So who knows?
7276680	7283880	Um, I suppose they could announce something at E3 or they might not, quite frankly, because it seems
7283880	7288920	that some of the prior rumors about things we were supposed to hear about at E3, like a Switch Pro,
7288920	7293800	may not actually be happening. So Nintendo may have flipped the entire fucking script this E3.
7293800	7299480	I don't know, but I think this is interesting. If we take the prior rumor as true that the
7299480	7304440	Metroid game on Switch is pretty much done and it's coming out sooner rather than later,
7306760	7311960	then this might be the surprise announcement at E3. We know Nintendo can announce games
7311960	7317320	and have them out on the market in six weeks. Garage Builder games. They just did it. Just
7317320	7323080	did it. So could Nintendo announce a game that they're going to put out by Labor Day?
7323080	7330040	Absolutely. It'll be interesting. I hope so. And yeah, Tiger Claw says it worked for the
7330040	7334360	Return of Samus. It can work. That's right. They did that too. So it could work for Super Metroid.
7334360	7341320	It sure could. Boy, oh boy, is that some holy text though, in my opinion. Super Metroid is
7341320	7347880	the best video game ever made, in my opinion. Period. End of sentence. For them to redo it,
7348680	7356920	that's a tall order. But honestly, Metroid Zero Mish, if Nintendo is doing it themselves,
7356920	7362680	their track record on the remakes are pretty darn good. It probably will be a great game.
7362680	7366840	It probably won't have all the same magic of the original, but I will probably enjoy the
7366840	7371400	experience start to finish and I will absolutely buy it. But again, I don't want to set the
7371400	7376120	expectation. If it's a new adventure, if it's something, fuck, if it's a repackaging of the
7376120	7382040	previous Metroid games, I'm still happy to be quite honest. So we'll see. All right.
7383480	7390840	Let's move on. Dark Sakura. So, you know, there's a game that everyone loves to hate on,
7390840	7396280	I guess, or loves to rib. And that is, of course, the Super Mario Brothers movie
7397480	7407560	that came out in 93 and basically was chopped and edited into, like, a bunch of crap.
7409000	7414600	If you've ever watched the documentary about the making of this movie, it is absolutely worth it,
7414600	7420440	and just to see what could have been. I mean, honestly, I think the realism factor is a little
7420440	7426520	bit too much, but it could have been some gritty stuff. So anyway, there is an extended cut of
7426520	7435160	Super Mario Brothers, and it's been there for years. People have been trying to compile all of
7435160	7442760	these different aspects of them, you know, found footage and things from the internet and things
7442760	7452360	that people put together and, you know, recovered footage. So this completed version was actually
7452360	7459160	done by Rocky Morton and Annabel Jankel. This is a version that was completed before
7459800	7470040	the final one had made it into the theaters. So it has been surfaced, called the Morton Jankel cut.
7470040	7478840	There's been more people in the Super Mario Brothers archive community and a restorationist
7478840	7487720	named Garrett Gilchrist who put together a re-edited, touched-up version of the movie,
7488280	7495800	and it is available out there on the internet for those in chat. I am going to link it to you
7495800	7500760	right this minute so you can watch it, preferably after you watch me stream after the show.
7503240	7509080	But there you go. Well, let's ask a real talk. I watched a little bit of it. Okay, I was going
7509080	7514520	to ask a real talk question. Who's going to watch it? Like, it's okay? You said you watched a little
7514520	7522280	bit of it. I started and then I had stuff to do. How was it so far? It was okay. I kind of didn't
7522280	7527640	know what I was watching, so I'll have to just sit more time with it when I haven't been drinking
7527640	7531480	and watch it. Yeah, and the reason why I pose that question is like, it's one of those things
7531480	7534680	where I'm like, okay, that's kind of neat that this exists, that someone put the time in the...
7534680	7541480	I'm not going to watch it. I think I also put the wrong link in chat. Let me try this again.
7542440	7546680	No, I did. That's the right one. That's a big old MP4. That's a big download. Watch your bandwidth.
7547640	7560280	Well, I mean, this is just the viewing of it. So I am... Let's see. MPEG4 file is 3.7 gigabytes.
7561640	7567800	That's not too bad. It says DVD part one, MP4, blah, blah, blah. Well, I'm going to download it.
7567800	7572840	Why not? I've got internet. SSJ100Matt says, maybe when I go to the DMV at some point,
7572840	7577240	I'll check it out. Yeah. Maybe I'll download it for my next flight. Who knows?
7578360	7583240	Well, Rob, you know my love of not great movies.
7583800	7589240	I know. I know. Well, I love not great movies too. Hello. How many times have I seen Showgirls?
7589240	7592040	I could quote that movie. It's so bad, it's good.
7592040	7592840	You don't know shit.
7595800	7597000	You are a whore, darlin'.
7597000	7603720	All right. Anyhow, let's move on. Loki.
7605640	7615240	So Valve is making some changes to Counter-Strike Go or CSGO, basically to try to combat some of
7615240	7621000	the trolling that goes along in the game and some of the cheaters, I guess. But right now,
7621080	7628200	the way Go stands is that a lot of features are available in the free-to-play version of that.
7628200	7632840	But apparently you can buy Prime, which allows you to have Prime-only matchmaking, item drops,
7632840	7637960	XP bonuses, and stuff like that. Along with some of those, they're saying that now they're going
7637960	7645080	to be kind of putting that behind that paywall to disincentivize folks from basically creating
7645080	7650120	accounts to troll and then, you know, with the intent that they may get banned and then creating
7650120	7656760	another free account and that type of stuff. So the rank ladder, they said right now, has a lot
7656760	7665640	of cheaters in it. And the high-ranked players are making new accounts to stump noobs and griefers
7665640	7671320	are creating accounts to potentially throw the game and trolls and whatnot. So they're trying to...
7672440	7676600	It's unfortunate that they're kind of hurting the community in the sense that, you know, there's
7676600	7681160	probably folks that want to try that out for free, but in order to try to combat some of the stuff
7681160	7685640	they're having to put it behind a paywall to try to make it a little bit harder to just create a
7685640	7691880	bunch of dummy accounts and also make them more money at the same time. Yeah, but I mean, like,
7691880	7695640	how much money is there to be made from Counter-Strike? How old is it? Well, I say that,
7695640	7700760	but obviously this game is still... Yeah, I guess that was a dumb thing now that the words have left
7700760	7706360	my mouth. But MMOs kind of have to do all this all the time to kind of prevent the
7706440	7710600	exploits and all this stuff. So I guess it's not... It's just more surprising it took this long.
7710600	7718120	The TLDR about it is basically before there used to be a way to earn Prime status by playing the
7718120	7722520	game long enough. Now you have to actually purchase it. There's no free path to Prime.
7724680	7728440	It would be easy to just stay logged in and rack up time that way, I'm sure,
7728440	7731160	or, you know, do private matches with other bots or something.
7731160	7738520	Something like that. Yeah. All right. Well, hey, since I bitch a lot about bandwidth and
7738520	7744120	exceeding it in this day and age, here's some news that is actually a great thing because this game
7744120	7747800	has a gigantic footprint. But you know what? It's one of those things where it's like,
7747800	7752600	I understand it because this game is so goddamn beautiful. And that's the new Microsoft Flight
7752600	7759000	Simulator. So kind of like the reboot of Flight Simulator that came out in the kind of last year,
7759000	7767080	I think it was, earlier in the year. The original install size has shrunk from 170 gigabytes,
7767080	7773960	yes, it was that big, to 83 gigabytes. So that's pretty awesome. And that's from notes on the most
7773960	7779880	recent patch in the game. We don't know exactly what they did. Obviously, they've optimized
7779880	7785400	something, but that's a hell of a lot of bandwidth to save. So they cut some corners somewhere,
7785400	7790120	you know, optimized graphics on another side or something. I don't know what they did.
7790120	7796600	But yeah, they've cut the footprint down a lot. This is also good knowing that the Xbox version
7796600	7801160	is out pretty soon. Have they dated the Xbox version? I don't think they have. They're just
7801160	7805000	saying it soon. Maybe we'll find out at E3. I bet that's one of those games we'll get updated on at
7805000	7813400	E3. And it'll be good that the print is smaller for the Xbox version because like 170 gigs on
7813400	7818360	that drive, you're eating so much install space for other games. You won't even be able to play
7818360	7822440	hardly anything else. So I think it's great that they're getting the footprint struck down for when
7822440	7827640	that comes out on Xbox. I'm excited to try it on Xbox because I think the controller and all that's
7827640	7833240	really gonna take a lot of the complications out of the game. I know you can do a lot to get,
7833240	7837880	but I think once they make the interface more controller friendly and for the Xbox audience,
7837880	7844840	I think I'm going to be able to get into it a lot more. It's beautiful. I've watched streamers
7844840	7853080	play the game and it's always a good experience. It really, really looks good. Legend of Zaku says
7853080	7858360	it's compression and lots of it. Bobby Blackwolf says it was out during Summer Games Done Quick
7858360	7863080	last year. Oh, I didn't realize it was that late in the year. I thought it was before the pandemic,
7863080	7871640	but I guess not. You know what? I know you're right, but it's one of those things where I
7871640	7877000	was only able to download it because Comcast suspended all the bandwidth caps at the beginning
7877000	7883080	of the pandemic. Remember that? So I was like 190 gigabyte install, who gives a shit? And I did it.
7883080	7892360	So you're right. It was that time. So, all right. Anyhow, let's see. Bonds006 says,
7892360	7897640	yeah, I saw 170 gigs and was like, that's a no for me. Granted, I have a 320 gig hard drive for
7897640	7903720	my PC games. Ooh, time to get three terabytes. So, all right. Anyway, I'm really looking forward
7903720	7909160	to the Xbox version of the game. I want to check that out. Yeah, Zaku says I bought a new one
7909160	7915400	terabytes solid state drive for the game because of the near 200 gigabyte size for it. Yeah, I bet
7915400	7919880	there's lots of people on the Xbox side of the house that are going to get a new drive so they
7919880	7926680	can put that game on it along with others. So, wow. August 17th, 2020. I can't believe it was
7926680	7933320	that late in the year. Wow. I would say time has just flown by, except it hasn't. It's been very
7933320	7938920	slow. All right. Anyhow, I think that was the last story we had on deck for tonight.
7938920	7942920	So, we're going to get into the listener roundtable, which includes our mailbag.
7942920	7947320	And Dark Soccer is going to hop on over there. Participate at orangelandradio.com if you want
7947320	7951560	to send us email, but please not if you're a spammer because unfortunately that is something
7951560	7958680	that's starting to rear its ugly head again. So, if you signed us up for that, choke. But we do
7958680	7962920	have, do we have any real emails this week? I thought we have one. Yay. One email. Let's get to
7962920	7970840	it. And it's a very simple email. Okay. It comes from Dee in Waterloo. Waterloo. Okay. Yes. I know
7970840	7976840	Waterloo. I said that because of your, you know, your ABBA thing. Waterloo. I'm sure the listener
7976840	7988760	has never heard that before. What is the most overused term in gaming? Toxic. Ooh. But it's
7988760	7996120	accurate. I'm playing so much Dead by Daylight that, you know. But you say it's accurate,
7996120	8001640	so does that really make it overused? They could come up with other words like asshole.
8003960	8012120	Asshole survivors. Or teabagging little shits. I'm going to say, I'll say one that's kind of
8012120	8015640	controversial and it's one I see in Dead by Daylight and I see it in a lot of games and I
8016520	8020920	think it's getting to be a little bit of a tired expression to the point where I think people use
8020920	8028840	it sometimes to be toxic. I'm going to say GG is overused. Really? Yeah. Well, it's just sort of
8028840	8034040	like a tradition now. Like just, you know, GGS or. I feel like if you want to, like it would mean
8034040	8038360	10 times more if you actually typed out good game and then I know you meant it. Because I think
8038360	8042840	there's some people that like, let's take Dead by Daylight for instance. They fucking wipe the
8042840	8048680	floor with the survivors. Then the killer puts GG, happy face. When it's like, bitch, you're
8048680	8053880	just saying that because you won, you know. I appreciate the ones that'll actually be up front
8053880	8060520	and say GG easy. Oh no, I think that's the worst when people say GG easy. At least I know that
8060520	8066520	they're being sarcastic shits. Okay, okay. So you know, okay. I get what you mean. It
8066520	8068040	quantifies it for me. Yes.
8070920	8074120	Oh, well, Loki, let me let you go. And then I'm going to read the chat because
8075080	8083000	chat said one. I'm like, oh, that's a good one too. Yeah, for me, it's always, well,
8083560	8090920	overused in our games at least is WB and TY because everyone logging on. Welcome back.
8091720	8096840	Thank you. I don't know. Um, I can't really think of anything that's like super overused
8096840	8102280	aside from, you know, pog. I guess poggers. I was going to say poggers too is I'm like,
8102280	8107400	I don't, I think it's like, I get it. Pogs were those little discs in the nineties.
8108040	8111640	No, no. Well, like I get what the meaning is, but I think it's like,
8112280	8116360	like everything is not pog. Like it's just like, you know, that could be cool, but it's not like,
8116440	8118280	Oh my God. It's voggers.
8124840	8129880	See, we could have gotten so much more traffic if we just called ourselves pog network.
8129880	8134360	Yeah. The, the, instead of the voice of geeks network, the, uh, pantomime of geeks network,
8134360	8140680	I guess, I don't know what other words starts with P is there a personification of geek.
8140680	8144600	There's gotta be a pog network. There are enemy.
8146360	8149480	I support all networks except that one. No, I'm just kidding. I don't even know
8149480	8155160	if there is a pog or what it, what they have. Anyway. Um, let's see some comments from chat.
8155160	8161400	Uh, Bobby black Wolf and Mike deaf both said F is the most overused thing. Yeah.
8161400	8166200	F F is a good one. Although I kind of liked that emoji. I know one of you has it. That's
8166200	8173080	like an F on a gravestone. That one's kind of funny. Um, Tiger claw says, how about LOL?
8173080	8176760	That's overused. I don't think that's unique to gaming. That's not gaming,
8176760	8181080	but I'm also guilty of it. I will admit I do sometimes look at my text and I'm like,
8181080	8187080	I say LOL a lot, but to me, I think sometimes when I say LOL, it's to kind of like emphasize
8187080	8191400	that like, I'm saying this in a positive way. Like I'm not saying this to be a Dick or something
8191400	8199640	like this or whatever. Like, you know, that's funny. LOL. I don't know. Um, let's see. I'm
8199640	8205000	looking, uh, fifth dream says thank you for your continued support and please look forward to it.
8205000	8210040	Meaning we fucked up. Thanks for not abandoning it and don't hold your breath respectively.
8212120	8214440	I like that. Or just anything on the roadmap.
8216520	8223400	All right. Oh, SSU 100. Matt has linked me to a Twitter account for pog network.
8224680	8229240	What I want to see what they do. They probably have like 10 times the followers. Oh no,
8229240	8233960	they only have 54 followers. Oh, they're league of legends streamers. All right, cool.
8234840	8240360	Poggers. All right. Well, there's, you know what, my cease and desist right now, because,
8240360	8246280	because they're a small network and they're not there, they haven't, uh, broke through in a way
8246280	8251800	and overused the way that acronym has. I'll say, all right, as long as you're not toxic shit bags
8251800	8257080	in league of legends, cause if you think dead by daylight's bad play a match of league of legends,
8257080	8262600	my God. So as long as y'all are keeping it positive, then I will say you don't have to
8262600	8270280	be our enemy anymore. Pog network. Okay. All right. I'll put it this way. I just had a few
8270280	8275880	people that I know who play survivor and I'm like, if you see a plague wearing this cosmetic,
8275880	8283480	be nice. Cause it might be you. Well, yeah. And as far as I know, I was watching,
8283480	8287240	I was watching somebody and they went up against a plague and somebody in chat said,
8287240	8293640	is this dark Sakura? And I was like, yeah, she's fucking everywhere. Well, no, it was,
8293640	8299960	it was a taste channel. Okay. It probably was taste channel. I told T I told T if you see a plague,
8299960	8307800	be nice. And then I said, uh, when I got back, he's like, we went against the plague, but I
8307800	8313640	don't think it was you. Cause you let, you let people find stuff and I was like, it probably
8313640	8319000	wasn't me. Um, and then I, I sent a picture of what my cosmetic looks like. There you go.
8319000	8326680	That's funny. Yeah. All right. Anyway. Um, all right. Uh, that's it for mailbag. Let's get to,
8326680	8330280	uh, do you have any last minute stories, Loki? And I'm going to, and if you guys have any questions
8330280	8335160	in chat, uh, please, please feel free to type away in chat. Uh, I will get as well to some of
8335160	8339400	our discord submissions for this week. Loki. Yeah. I did want to mention that there is that
8339400	8344280	bundle that's available on itch IO for support Palestine. Oh my God. We didn't put that in our
8344280	8349720	show. I'm so sorry. This wasn't for $5. So, you know, you know, it's a pretty good, that's a
8349720	8355800	pretty good price. So a thousand, I should say it's not all games, there's assets and stuff in
8355800	8359400	there too, but there's a lot of games in there. So, uh, check it out. And I know that there's
8359400	8364200	some nest maker games in there as well. Um, cause they posted that in our little, uh, community.
8365480	8371320	Yeah. Cool. Anything else? I haven't got the channel up yet here. I'm working on it.
8372600	8378120	I don't have anything. Yeah. I don't really have anything else that's worth mentioning.
8378120	8383960	I make sure we're going to have lots of stuff this week. In completely like not even news. Uh,
8384760	8390200	I learned that, that kind of John is on Tik TOK and that makes me happy cause she's adorable
8391080	8398360	as in the wrestler Oscar. How do I use Tik TOK? Like I have a Tik TOK and I posted one thing to it
8398360	8402360	Halloween of 2019 that looking back isn't even that funny. Like
8402360	8408440	how do I, what do I post on Tik TOK? I have four dead by daylight clips and then me watching
8408440	8413800	Oscar on TV. Okay. I guess I have seen a lot of Twitch streamers trying to like put clips from
8413800	8418120	their streams as Tik TOKs, which is interesting. I mean, I guess it's a good way to promote,
8418120	8425560	I guess that makes sense. Yeah. I only have a hand. I mean, my, my Tik TOK is I think dark
8425560	8434440	Sakura. I just need to do more streaming. Um, so I mean, if someone wants to hold on,
8434440	8440280	I'm actually going to see what the hell my Tik TOK is called. Uh, dark Sakura underscore O L R.
8440280	8443560	I'm pretty sure I'm Rob Roberts, but don't follow me. I don't post anything.
8444440	8447880	Y'all can follow me and then teach me the ways of the, the Tik TOKs.
8448520	8453240	Yeah. The Tik TOKs. The Tik TOKs. I love Tik TOKs.
8453240	8459400	More like Tik TOKs. Sorry. The only time I hear Tik TOK, I can only think of return to Oz.
8460760	8467160	Oh God. Yes. I think of, I think of, uh, catching fire. Tik TOK, Tik TOK.
8467160	8471000	You know, somebody I'm sure it's been done, but somebody needs to post that character,
8471000	8474840	Tik TOK from return to Oz on Tik TOK and say, Hey, I heard you like Tik TOKs.
8475400	8479080	Like surely has that been done? Surely someone did that. Someone did that, right?
8479880	8484360	Someone's going to be corny to do that. Yeah. All right. You know, I saw that in the theater, Rob.
8484360	8487880	Oh, so did I, I saw it at the, I saw it at the discount theater.
8488600	8494200	I saw it when it premiered. So for you locals, so we're based out of Sacramento, California,
8494200	8497480	and I know there's a few of you that are local that listen because you're kind of like,
8497480	8500680	it's really surreal to hear you guys talk about local places on the show. Well,
8500680	8506680	I've got one for you. Brace yourself. I saw return to Oz at the Harding cinema. Anyone
8506680	8512040	remember that out in Roseville, the Harding cinema, which I think turned into a radio
8512040	8516840	shack after they closed it. That's how big the Harding cinema was is that they turned it into a
8516840	8522600	radio shack, but it was like 99 cent matinees during the day. And that's where I saw return
8522600	8530600	to Oz. So. Hey, Rob, guess what I drove by today? Not today, but, uh, when Becky and I
8530600	8535640	were on our way to San Francisco yesterday, cause it's not for coffee. Crest View Lanes.
8535640	8542040	The sign is still there. Oh, oh, it's still there. The sign is the building is long gone.
8542040	8546840	I was gonna say they probably made condos over there by now, but the sign is still there. And
8546840	8550520	I wonder if they're just going to leave it up. Huh? I wonder, have they built anything in its
8550520	8557320	place yet or no, it's still a lot weird. Yeah. But Crest View is where like we would go play.
8557320	8563320	Dan and I would go play air guys and, and blazing star and sweet arcade. Yeah. Yeah. The arcade
8563320	8568040	there was pretty, pretty tops. And they had, uh, they had a DDR for a hot minute. You know what
8568040	8574280	arcade I haven't been to in centuries is, um, the 24 hour bowling alley. That's still there on what
8574280	8582360	country club? I thought the bowling alleys were all closed. It's orange. Uh, Sacramento got
8582360	8587160	promoted to orange, so they should have reopened because bowling alleys were, uh, in that. Unless
8587160	8590360	for whatever reason, they don't think they can follow COVID, but I think they would have reopened
8590360	8597720	by now. So I, since I've been there because I did the, you know, this was back a couple of years ago,
8597720	8601720	uh, at this point because of COVID, but we used to do the, uh, laser tag circuit.
8601720	8607320	And, uh, so we went there to play laser, uh, X because I haven't ever played laser X,
8607320	8613240	even though I used to go there all the time for DDR. Um, but they, yeah, they completely changed
8613240	8617880	up that. So they have two arcades now. Um, they have the original arcade. We used to play DDR in,
8617880	8624760	which is where they have like their oversized enormous giant, like cockpit games, which is
8624760	8629000	basically what everything is nowadays. So that your Jurassic parks, your giant nerve thing,
8629000	8634760	um, Mario Kart, um, and try to think what else, but like racing games and stuff like that.
8634760	8640120	Then they have a whole ticket section that's shoved way back, like it towards the back of
8640120	8643720	the building. And they've got a whole nother section with like tickets. That's where the,
8643720	8647320	that's where the nightclub used to be is where all the ticket spitters are. Yeah.
8647320	8652680	Yes. Freeze pop. I used to, I used to go to the club there.
8653320	8656840	Yeah. Freeze pop played there once. And now it's a, it's a room full of tickets,
8656840	8663000	spitters depressing face. I know. Right. All right. Uh, okay. Sorry. Sorry. We delved into
8663000	8667640	local chat, but you know what? I'm sure a lot of these stories, honestly, you could swap the names
8667640	8672440	of the places and the towns. They'd probably be very similar. All right. Anyway. Uh, so some of
8672440	8676360	y'all post stories throughout the week at our discord vog network.com slash discord. And I like
8676360	8680760	to read some of those, uh, tiger claw posted in our channel. I think this is funny. The director
8680760	8685400	of the tech and games is throwing shade at Sega and challenging the Virtua Fighter team to make
8685400	8692120	a new game. Make a new game. You cowards. Okay. He didn't say that, but he did make a video.
8693400	8696120	I would love it if he did actually, that'd be hilarious.
8696120	8702440	Katsuhiro Harada posted on his personal YouTube channel about a Virtua Five fighter ultimate
8702440	8708440	showdown coming out. And, uh, he's always viewed surpassing SEGA series as a professional goal.
8709240	8715800	I love that. And I'm on his side. Uh, tiger class says, if you're into collecting Funko pops,
8715800	8720840	they just announced a sly Cooper pop. Anyone, anyone collect those fun? I get them once in a
8720840	8725880	great while. In fact, right next to me. Well, I guess I don't, I thought I had it next to me,
8725880	8731720	but I guess not. I have a, a large, uh, Richard Simmons doll, but I had a Richard Simmons, um,
8732520	8736360	Funko pop and I couldn't pass it up. I have a collection of Deadpools.
8736920	8744440	Do you have mermaid Deadpool, Bob Ross, Deadpool, uh, barista Deadpool, um, scooter Deadpool,
8744440	8748200	because, uh, because it reminds me of my favorite cover for cable and Deadpool.
8749320	8757160	Um, it's the one where they try to redo the, uh, Acura one. And I have, I need the other two
8757160	8763640	golden girls, but I have, I have, I have significant pops. I have all the golden girls
8763640	8768840	over off camera. So, all right. Uh, let me do one more. And I know dark soccer, you go ahead,
8768840	8772120	dark soccer, if you're going to, if you need to bow out to sort some things before, uh,
8772120	8777560	after the show, uh, any final thoughts for our listeners tonight? Um, just, uh, don't be a
8777560	8785960	shithole. Um, just be a nice person, be kind and, uh, stay tuned for my stream. All right.
8785960	8791400	Have a good night. You do love everybody hearts. Bye. All right. Don't go anywhere just yet though,
8791400	8794520	folks. We've still got a little more. I've got a few more headlines I want to read for you guys
8794520	8801400	here. Uh, and that would be, uh, this one, apparently this leak is real. There is an
8801400	8806920	X-com style Avengers game coming from 2k. That sounds very interesting. Uh,
8808920	8814360	yeah, right. That could be very interesting. So, uh, we'll see. Hmm. Interesting. Anyway,
8814360	8818600	thanks you guys for sharing some of those headlines there over at, uh, our discord
8818600	8824680	channel, vognetwork.com slash discord. Um, w are we out of last minute stories, Loki?
8825720	8829880	I think so for now. Yeah. All right. All right. Let me see, let me see if I can sneak in one more
8829880	8835880	headline here then. Uh, let's see. Let's see. Let's see. Um, apparently some folks are talking
8835880	8839800	about that. It's a little bit of a pain in the butt to transfer your save over with final fantasy
8839800	8845080	seven. I didn't read too much into that. Oh, um, okay. And shopping news, I guess they dated
8845080	8849560	Amazon prime day for June 21st and 22nd. I know some people don't like to get their games from
8849560	8853880	there anymore, but for those that do there's that I imagine there'll be some gaming sales.
8853880	8861960	Uh, so that's a thing you're into check that out, I guess. Um, Ooh, I like, I forgot this from dark
8861960	8868040	Tetsuya. Okay. I really liked this. A paper boy and spy Hunter comic came out from DC.
8868680	8874680	What the hell is that? Is it, um, yes, spy Hunter and paper boy. Uh, but interesting cause
8874840	8878600	I replied to that and said, I don't see anywhere mentioned that it's based on the games,
8878600	8883320	but why else would you combine those two things? And it's clearly a paper boy and like a dude in
8883320	8891160	the car that looks like spy Hunter. That's kind of weird. Very, very weird. Um, SSU,
8891160	8895560	one hundred mountain chat says question, what is the status of the show being in person again?
8895560	8901400	No pressure. Just curious. I thought there was a date, but I forgot it. Um, there is not a date yet.
8901960	8909480	Um, and, um, hopefully, uh, we'll have news on that in the near future. Um, there's just,
8909480	8914600	there's a lot of changes going on, uh, behind the scenes and stuff. So I just don't know when that's
8914600	8924040	going to happen yet. Um, but hopefully soonish. So, um, all right. Uh, let's see. Pod culture
8924040	8928680	says he just found my Tik TOK. I said, don't follow me. He's in a suit and tie. Cause it was
8928680	8932440	listen to the Tik TOK. It was a Halloween costume that I put together in five minutes.
8932440	8939480	That should be obvious. So, all right. Um, orange right in chat says Midway arcade collection.
8939480	8945720	Nah, Midway comics universe. Okay. Here's that. So, all right. Uh, I think that'll do it. Let's
8945720	8950680	wrap things up. So, uh, thank you guys very much for listening to and, uh, supporting orange
8950680	8954520	launch radio. Hey, if you enjoyed what you heard here at the show, tell a friend or two about the
8954520	8958600	show, help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice. But, um,
8958600	8965080	as long as, uh, your voice is, uh, I'm sorry, as long as, let me start over. We are the show where
8965080	8969000	every gamer has a voice, but we need more voices here. So tell a friend or two about the show,
8969000	8973080	help us spread the word. And, uh, we really appreciate that. A nice five star review on
8973080	8977800	a site like iTunes or wherever it is you found this show goes an awful long way. Um,
8979080	8982760	if you feel so inclined, we have a shop where you can buy some merchandise,
8982760	8987720	vog and network.com slash shop. I keep pestering Jamie to add stuff to it. Um,
8987720	8992440	cause she launched her own shop. And so I got those designs. I sent you like a long time ago.
8993080	8998280	Yeah. Remember the pixel art vog thing. You are absolutely right. I need to get on that. I,
8998280	9001800	you sent me a finish. You sent me an in progress fog one, right? You finished a fog one.
9001800	9005880	No, I thought that was the finished one. Let me just double check. Cause I only remember seeing
9005880	9010120	one in progress, but you know what? Loki it is Dan. I, with everything that happened in the
9010120	9016520	past year, I absolutely could have slipped. So it sounds like something new coming soon. It sounds
9016520	9025800	like, so, uh, stay tuned for that vog network.com slash shop. Um, and, uh, I think, I think that's
9025800	9029800	really it. Uh, I guess we can get final thoughts as well. Uh, thank you for being here and listening
9029800	9034280	to the whole show. I know it was a little bit slower of a news week, but we're on the eve of
9034280	9038840	E3 slash the big June announcements, I think is really the better name for it.
9038840	9042120	Now that we have summer games fest and all these other things in the mix,
9042120	9046840	we're the week before the big June announcements. So, uh, it's going to be a fun week and we'll have
9046840	9052040	lots and lots to talk about next week. Uh, I'm really excited for it. So, uh, Loki,
9052040	9056200	why don't you give us your final thought tonight? It's going to be a very busy week for me and a
9056200	9060600	very exciting week as well. So excited for you to look, look forward to talking to you guys next
9060600	9065400	week. Uh, yeah, very excited to hear how it goes. Uh, even if we had to talk a lot about
9065400	9070360	Xbox and Bethesda as well next week, for sure. Um, and I, I don't know if I have a lot to say,
9070360	9076200	but, uh, my final thought is, um, I, I'm, I'm going to try to get on some more creation in
9076200	9081160	this next week as well and, and get my own community. Like Loki's found his dark soccer's
9081160	9085480	found hers and so forth. So, uh, there you go. That's going to do it for another week,
9085480	9088280	uh, here at orange launch radio. Have a wonderful night, everybody.
