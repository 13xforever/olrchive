0	13720	Over its lifetime, the Xbox One eventually gained backwards compatibility for some titles
13720	16920	as far back as the Xbox, well, the very first Xbox.
16920	21440	But soon, Xbox One owners could gain the ability to play some Xbox Series S and X titles, presumably
21440	22560	via Game Pass.
22560	26360	PlayStation Now has, of course, provided similar features like this for many years already.
26360	28080	This is likely a new majority trend of gaming.
28080	31280	And now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki, to tell you more
31280	34000	about this and the rest of the week's news, starting right now on the show, where every
34000	37000	gamer has a voice.
37000	44360	Hello, my friends out there on the internet.
44360	48620	Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
48620	56600	It is Orange Lounge Radio, and we are back and live once again with episode number 873
56600	60200	of our show for June 20th, 2021.
60200	64960	My name is Rob Roberts, and I'm joining you here every week with my co-hosts.
64960	68560	First off, DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers, not here at the moment.
68560	72200	She's going to come into the show a little bit later on around 7 o'clock Pacific time,
72200	73200	10 o'clock Eastern.
73200	75340	So we'll say hi to her a little later.
75340	79480	But we do have joining us right off the top of the show, we have Loki joining us.
79480	80480	Hi, Loki.
80480	81480	Hello.
81480	82480	How's it going?
82480	83480	Hi, how are you?
83480	84480	I'm doing pretty good.
84480	85480	Rushing around.
85480	86480	Yeah.
87360	89200	Kind of running around there at the last minute before the show starts tonight.
89200	92360	Hold on, my bridge is still open.
92360	93360	You're okay.
93360	94800	I have no idea what's going on over there.
94800	95800	That's fine.
95800	99960	And, you know, it's the joy of doing live stuff because my headphones that I usually
99960	103420	hear Loki on just decided they're not going to work tonight.
103420	106760	So something's weird with my setup on how I listen to things.
106760	108880	So that's another thing I've got to try to fix behind the scenes.
108880	113080	Luckily, I can still hear him from the TV that's in the studio here.
113080	114560	But it's a little harder to hear.
114640	117480	I prefer the headphones.
117480	120960	But that's just the joy of running and doing things live sometimes.
120960	121960	Things happen.
121960	122960	Oh, thank you.
122960	123960	SG100 Matt gave me the Intel.
123960	124960	His fridge is open.
124960	125960	That's what he said.
125960	126960	Thank you.
126960	127960	The live chat.
127960	129640	Always here to save the day because we do tape live.
129640	131520	Every Sunday night.
131520	132520	What's that?
132520	136400	I was going to say I shut it really quickly because I was putting my dinner stuff away.
136400	138960	And it's got like this weird latch on it.
138960	141440	So if you shut it too fast, it stays open.
141440	143000	I see.
143000	144000	That sounds complicated.
144440	145440	That's all right.
145440	146440	All right.
146440	147440	News for everybody.
147440	148440	All right.
148440	149440	Let's see.
149440	151440	What else I want to say?
151440	154840	Yes, we do have our chat room because we do tape live every Sunday night at six o'clock
154840	159820	Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern at twitch.tv slash vog network right after the Bobby Black
159820	160820	Wolf show.
160820	162520	And Loki, I wanted to say as well.
162520	163520	Happy Father's Day.
163520	169320	It is that day and happy Father's Day to all the gamer dads out there and all my gamer
169320	170320	daddies.
170320	171320	Wink wink nudge nudge.
171320	173440	I hope you all are having a wonderful day.
174440	176920	Was your day full of Metroid I see playing behind you?
176920	180520	I think that's Metroid Zero Mission specifically.
180520	182080	That's Metroid Fusion, actually.
182080	183840	Oh, my bad.
183840	187360	So no, it was not playing Metroid at all.
187360	193560	It was roller skating and grocery shopping.
193560	194560	I see.
194560	200400	And rushing to finish while rushing to upload my video because for those who don't follow
200400	206320	me on Twitter, Comcast decided to be Comcast for the last two days.
206320	211380	And so I haven't had internet for like a day and a half just on the weekend, too, which
211380	212380	is great.
212380	215760	Perfect timing because I had my I stayed up till two in the morning to get my episode
215760	216760	done.
216760	219560	It's ready to upload it and buy internet.
219560	224260	So it's yeah, that was fun.
224260	227440	And the kids, you know, they don't like not having internet.
227440	229200	They kind of bounce off the walls.
229200	232320	So yeah, it was unfortunate.
232320	234680	So I finally got that uploaded this afternoon.
234680	239240	So my brand new episode with Tango Tech from Hermitcraft is up, which is amazing.
239240	244680	I had a really great time with him last week, and it was very exciting to be able to cut
244680	246440	that down once again.
246440	251880	I listened back to it as I was editing it, and I don't like listening to well, this is
251880	255000	going to be interesting going into Wednesday because I don't like listening back to myself
255000	261040	as it is and listening back to myself when I'm incredibly nervous, made me incredibly
261040	262040	nervous.
262040	263760	So that was fun.
263760	270520	But I did get to cut it down to make it seem like I'm less nervous than I actually was,
270520	271520	which is good.
271520	276520	But yeah, go check it out if you can, you know, hopefully people find it because I mean,
276520	277600	it's pretty amazing.
277600	281600	And I know I've been watching a lot of Hermitcraft season eight that they just started.
281600	282600	So yeah.
283200	284200	Yeah.
284200	285200	Keep on going.
285200	286200	Excellent.
286200	287680	I fixed my headphone problems while you were talking there.
287680	288680	Thank you.
288680	291800	ST100Matt actually links that video there live in our chat room.
291800	295240	I'm sure for those that are not listening live tonight, because of course, we love all
295240	297480	the podcast listeners as well.
297480	298920	Hopefully you can get the link there.
298920	303120	I'm sure that'll be in our Discord server if it's not already, then yeah.
303120	306640	Speaking of things to check out, I do need to give this one cheap plug at the top of
306640	307640	the show.
307640	310800	I don't like to push the stuff to spend money on a lot.
310800	314720	But you know, some people ask like, can I get a shirt that says Orange Lounge Radio
314720	315720	on it?
315720	316720	Yes, you can.
316720	319040	We've actually done a really big update to our store.
319040	324280	So if you haven't checked out the shop, check that out over at vognetwork.com slash shop.
324280	328640	And now not only can you get that cool little OLR pixel logo, but Jamie went in there made
328640	329640	some new stuff.
329640	333720	So there's a very like Sega inspired Orange Lounge Radio type of shirt you can get.
333720	336120	You can get a one piece swimsuit if that's your thing.
336120	340400	Loki, I'm sure you're very excited to hear that you can get some stickers.
340400	342400	You can get some tumblers.
342400	346600	You can get there's actually a fanny pack like my wife would be super.
346600	347600	You can get a fanny.
347600	349360	Apparently, that's the hot merch.
349360	350940	Somebody else is bringing that up earlier.
350940	353360	So fanny packs are all the rage again.
353360	355100	And then actually speaking of pixel logos.
355100	356100	So we have some really cool.
356100	358740	OK, so dark soccer did a new Orange Lounge Radio logo.
358740	361980	She did a cool little retro kind of vog network look.
361980	362980	That's pretty cool.
362980	363980	So check that out.
363980	368960	And then speaking of retro looks, Loki's vog pixel art we talked about on the show a couple
368960	370120	weeks ago.
370120	373880	He just had to resend me the email and go, I sent this to you months ago, dummy.
373880	374880	No, he didn't say that.
374880	376860	But that's that's definitely what I heard.
376860	377860	That's OK.
377860	378860	He said that.
378860	384060	And that's it's like my work, you know, where the well, the tone of your email.
384060	385220	There's no tone in the email.
385220	386220	It's text.
386220	389640	Well, I interpreted it as you were angry.
389640	393160	Loki started off his email saying per my prior email.
393160	394160	He did.
394160	395160	No, he was totally fine.
395160	396160	I'm just giving a shit.
396160	398560	I feel like a dummy because you totally had sent that before.
398560	399560	But things happen.
400000	404000	But now the vog pixel stuff is up on the show up on the shop, too.
404000	407200	So, yeah, there's there's in fact, I think we put so much stuff on there.
407200	408300	We had to get rid of stuff.
408300	410140	I don't think you can get the vog masks anymore.
410140	411960	They might if they're still there.
411960	415960	It's not going to be for much longer because we kind of collaboratively decided those are
415960	417240	the first things being pulled.
417240	422200	I didn't care for the masks myself, but, you know, I guess if some people wanted them,
422200	423200	that's cool, too.
423200	424200	So.
424200	425200	All right.
425200	426200	There you go.
426200	427520	She Hulk in chat.
427520	428520	Thank you.
428520	429520	Saying push it.
430480	431480	So sell in the store.
431480	432480	Yes, I will.
432480	433480	And thank you very much for the biddies.
433480	434480	Appreciate that.
434480	435480	All right.
435480	436480	Let's get it.
436480	437480	OK.
437480	438480	Bobby says the masks are gone.
438480	439480	OK.
439480	440480	That's what I thought, because I know there's like a ton of new stuff in there.
440480	441480	And I know Bobby still wants to add a couple of things, too.
441480	444000	So I know we want to make sure we have enough room for everybody's stuff.
444000	445000	So.
445000	446000	All right.
446000	447000	Check that out.
447000	448000	Again, vog network dot com slash shop.
448000	449000	Let's get to news.
449000	451760	This was kind of the second half of E3 week.
451760	456680	There were some, you know, live I can't always say press conferences, but that's not really
456680	458660	what they are this year.
458820	463380	Kind of the presentations, direct presentations, whatever you want to call them.
463380	465100	There was a few of them.
465100	468100	Capcom had one and it was extremely not notable.
468100	469100	I'm sorry.
469100	472060	Sorry if you're a Capcom fan, but I think everybody who watched that presentation kind
472060	477340	of saw they didn't really give any new stuff, which is fine.
477340	481580	I guess they kind of promoted it in other places, except they said, oh, we're making
481580	484780	DLC for Resident Evil 8 Village because it's so popular.
484780	485780	Thank you.
485980	489300	We hadn't started it yet, but we're going to get right on that.
489300	490300	So there's that.
490300	491300	Yeah.
491300	492300	Yeah.
492300	493300	It was interesting.
493300	494300	Quest Buster says no.
494300	495300	Rob's right.
495300	496300	The Capcom one was pretty trash.
496300	497880	I think there was a Bandai Namco one, too.
497880	500840	But again, I don't think it gave us anything really new.
500840	504320	I think it was kind of just the stuff we already knew about, which I understand these kind
504320	506220	of presentations that come a little late.
506220	509820	I don't want to give too much shit because these presentations that come a little late
509820	514620	kind of have to read like how is Bandai Namco going to one up themselves after they put
514660	518620	that Elden Ring trailer in the Summer Games Fest thing.
518620	523580	Like, you know, it's but, you know, maybe sometimes people hope like, oh, maybe we'll
523580	526500	get gameplay or we'll get as a B trailer.
526500	527500	Yeah.
527500	528500	No, I guess.
528500	529500	Guess none of that as well.
529500	530500	So.
530500	531500	Yeah.
531500	537420	Anyway, Bobby Blackwolf is pointing out the E3 2008, the small one that wasn't in Santa
537420	540140	Monica, was the only Capcom presser I attended.
540140	541340	There was no game news.
541340	545380	It was just Avi Arad and some other people talking about how great the Lost Planet movie
545380	546380	was going to be.
546380	547460	I remember that one.
547460	548460	Yeah.
548460	551900	So sometimes these ones that are a little later, I mean, Konami always used to go late
551900	552900	in the game, too.
552900	555540	And we saw how well that worked out for them a couple of years in a row.
555540	556540	Right.
556540	557540	So, yeah.
557540	560940	So it's going to be great because it only lives in my imagination.
560940	561940	Yeah.
561940	567220	So most of the press events and stuff this week were not that exciting.
567220	571660	Let's be real or already had news that had come out before last week's show.
571660	576820	However, of course, Tuesday morning was the one that I think unarguably everyone was
576820	579420	really waiting for and knew would be the biggest one.
579420	581660	And that was the Nintendo Direct.
581660	585700	So let's recap a little bit about the Nintendo Direct and folks thoughts on that.
585700	587940	So, Loki, I know you watched it.
587940	589020	You actually watched it live.
589020	590020	I had to watch it.
590020	592180	I had to do the tape delay thing.
592180	596460	I had to do the thing like when we watch the Grammys on the West Coast.
596460	600180	It already aired on the East Coast, but we get the three hour tape delay.
600180	602680	The only one of those shows they don't actually I never watched the Grammys.
602680	603680	They're kind of garbage.
603680	607460	But it was just the first award show that came to mind that wasn't the Oscars or the
607460	611700	Super Bowl, because those are the two things that do air live on the West and East Coast
611700	612700	at the same time.
612700	614580	But most everything else, you have to wait three hours for.
614580	618460	So I had to watch the Nintendo Direct that way because I had I had meetings at work like
618460	620100	I couldn't get out of day job stuff.
620100	621100	It's important.
621100	624300	Well, I had meetings, too, but, you know, I just don't care.
624300	630820	No, I kind of had to lead mine, so well, OK, well, yeah, we had I had a meeting at
630820	631820	the same time.
631820	633820	It was about like.
633820	640700	It was about being motivated to like to be more organized and stuff, and it was just
640700	643380	a big old waste of time, so I popped this on instead.
643380	645460	It was way more interesting.
645460	650100	Love that you had a meeting about work motivation and you're sitting there watching this Nintendo
650100	651100	thing.
651100	652100	It cracks me up.
652300	656860	I actually waited until I had an appropriate break, like an hour and a half later, and
656860	661020	then I was like, OK, I can probably watch this 40 minute presentation in 30 minutes
661020	664300	because I'll just fast forward all the game footage about things that I'm just like, I
664300	665620	don't really need to see it.
665620	666620	So, yeah.
666620	669420	And yeah, I would say I actually didn't do that as much as you think.
669420	671300	I probably got through it in about thirty five minutes.
671300	672300	So.
672300	673300	But yeah.
673300	674620	So I really enjoyed it.
674620	676620	Loki, what were your thoughts overall?
676620	677620	I thought it was pretty good.
677620	681940	There's I mean, like with most things, I think it did have a lot of stuff in there that
681980	686900	people were looking for and some surprise stuff that I was looking for.
686900	690780	Still a few things missing that, you know, kind of like some updates on, you know, like
690780	693700	being a three prime four and stuff like that.
693700	694700	Yeah.
694700	698260	But I mean, there is a lot of meat there, so it was still pretty good.
698260	699260	Yeah.
699260	700260	So I kind of going through.
700260	706020	Well, but before you get to that, I think I kind of agree with you is that, yeah, overall,
706020	707300	I was very positive on it.
707300	711180	And for me, you know, I kind of have like my wish list, things that if Nintendo would
711220	713740	announced would make me extremely happy.
713740	717940	And I got two things on my wish list this year from Nintendo, and that hardly ever happens.
717940	720500	And let's just I know we want to run down everything that happens.
720500	724220	But I think the obvious things to bring to the table, there's a brand new 2D Metroid
724220	725220	game.
725220	726220	Y'all know that's my jam.
726220	730020	Well, it's kind of new, like I get and I didn't even pick up on this at first.
730020	732420	And like, yeah, because I recognize the name.
732420	736220	So that's been in like development for a while or at least rumored for a while.
736220	737220	Yeah.
737220	738220	Yeah.
738260	739260	Yeah.
739260	740260	Yeah.
740260	741620	The Metroid Dread was originally, I think, going to be the DS.
741620	744660	I think they were developing alongside Fusion.
744660	747620	And it was right at that time, like the advance and the DS were kind of both.
747620	751740	So Fusion came out on the advance and then Dread kind of did it.
751740	754620	And it's like Metroid Other M kind of happened instead.
754620	756660	So we never really got Dread at that time.
756660	758420	And I didn't piece together at first.
758420	759980	Oh, it's that game.
759980	763700	But obviously, you know, here we are like 14 years later.
763700	766740	It's still Metroid Dread and maybe some of the original story ideas are there.
766740	769740	But obviously the game is completely different now that it's on the Switch.
769740	770780	It's not pixels.
770780	773260	It's kind of got a different look to it.
773260	774260	But obviously I'm here.
774260	775700	I'm here with pixels, to be honest.
775700	780860	I mean, I kind of wish it was in the style, like, say, the modern Rayman games and stuff
780860	782940	like that, where it's hand drawn.
782940	785940	That would have been so good, but it's all right.
785940	792500	Yeah, I, I, I would have I would have been thrilled if it was more a pixel looking game,
792500	793500	but I'm OK.
793500	795620	I understand they want to evolve it.
795620	797020	You know, they're pushing it a different direction.
797020	800780	So like even I remember because I was writing out like in my Apple notes as I was watching
800780	804360	it instead of live tweeting, I was kind of like, oh, this is a different look.
804360	805780	It's going to take me some getting used to.
805780	806780	But you know what?
806780	808860	As long as the game's fluid, it's going to be fine.
808860	812220	And I'm just thrilled we get a new Metroid in the series.
812220	817540	Now I'm Tiger Claw in chat over twitch.tv slash VOG Network says this new 2D Metroid
817540	821100	game is supposedly the final one for Samus.
821100	826300	If it sells really well, I'm sure they will find a way to do another one or there must
826300	829740	be some other character they're going to push it off to in the story of the game or so.
829740	830740	I don't know.
830740	831740	Obviously, Metroid Prime four.
831740	832840	We know it's still happening.
832840	834660	So, look, you said they didn't do an update.
834660	835660	They kind of did.
835660	836660	They didn't.
836660	837660	I know what you meant, though.
837660	840300	You wanted to see more footage or like what the hell is this thing look like?
840300	844500	But they did any footage, you know, they did say we're working on it.
844500	847660	We can't talk about it today, but we hope you'll take this instead.
847660	850980	And for me, I'm happy to take that instead this year.
850980	856340	So I'm fine if they need a little more time on Metroid Prime four.
856340	857340	So yeah.
857340	861940	Quest Quest Buster in chat says it's for the Samus Metroid arc, I thought, but not the
861940	862940	end of Samus.
862940	867260	Yeah, I just I just don't see them like actually actually having to be the last Samus game.
867260	871860	They could kill Samus at the end of this game and still not be done with her.
871860	874380	And obviously, I don't know spoilers or story or anything like that.
874380	875820	None of us have played the game yet.
875820	879220	But you know, it's just it's just like the alien franchise in Ripley.
879220	880220	OK.
880460	885580	Kill Samus, but then like she'll come back as a clone or something like that, like she's
885580	887340	not going to be done, done, done.
887340	888340	You know what I mean?
888340	889340	Yeah.
889340	891660	There will be there'll be Samus X like Mega Man will be Samus X.
891660	892660	Right.
892660	893660	Exactly.
893660	895960	So, yeah.
895960	900580	And as Joe and Hunter Matt says, in fact, there are no actual Metroids in this apparently.
900580	902700	I don't know if I believe that.
902700	904580	I know what I know what they're saying.
904580	905580	I know what they're saying.
905580	906580	I don't know if I believe it.
906580	910420	I think it's one of those things where they'll surprise us in the very last level.
910420	913820	But OK, let's let's not set our expectations too high.
913820	918020	But I'm just I'm just really happy to get a new 2D Metroid and see where they go with
918020	919020	it.
919020	921900	But I'm not sure I believe that there's no Metroids in it.
921900	922900	Sorry.
922900	926500	I just kind of like I think you're lying, but we'll see.
926500	928100	We'll see.
928100	932340	And then the other one and Loki, I know you've got to be thrilled with this one, too.
932340	935260	The new WarioWare announcement like that.
935260	936260	That's fantastic.
936260	938620	For all intents and purposes, that really came out of nowhere.
938620	942700	Like, I know there was some rumors about it, but a lot of things were rumored this year
942700	947460	that didn't happen, like a new model for the Switch.
947460	951300	So, you know, obviously, you know, anything can and will happen.
951300	954140	I'm very thrilled that the new WarioWare ended up being a thing.
954140	958900	I think it's interesting that they talked about it being the first WarioWare with co-op
958900	959900	when it's not.
959900	962980	Yeah, I don't think WarioWare.
962980	965500	It's not WarioWare on the GameCube had co-op.
965500	968980	So that was a little maybe they didn't say the first, but they kind of made it sound
968980	970860	like now there's co-op.
970860	973460	And it's like, well, you had that in the GameCube version.
973460	981700	It was, I think, very certain modes and very limited in that game, but it existed before.
981700	992700	I think I think the actual games themselves were not I think they were still for one player,
992700	994020	but you still played them.
994020	999700	I think that's the difference is that in this new one, you actually have games that
999700	1002220	are playable with two people at once.
1002220	1004180	And I don't think the GameCube version had that.
1004180	1005180	I can't remember.
1005180	1007740	So, there is that.
1007740	1010500	Hi, joining us here a little early, but that's OK.
1010500	1011500	We love to see her.
1011500	1012500	Hi there, DarkSakura.
1012500	1013500	I see you just joined us.
1013500	1014500	Hi.
1014500	1015500	Yeah, I woke up.
1015500	1016500	Well, good morning.
1016500	1019860	I have, I have strain cheese.
1019860	1020860	Yummy.
1020860	1024500	Hey, we just talked about the new Metroid and I know you have to have some feelings
1024500	1025500	on that.
1025500	1028300	What are your thoughts seeing the Metroid Dread announcement?
1028300	1031460	Give now.
1031460	1032460	What do you think?
1032460	1035180	What do you think about the whole there are no Metroids in this game?
1035180	1039780	I said that's bull, that they're lying, that they're trying to keep it a secret or something.
1039780	1043980	I honestly don't care about there being no Metroids in it because I saw Chozo and that
1043980	1045980	makes me happy.
1045980	1050340	There are other pieces of Metroid lore for us to be in love with.
1050340	1056140	I certainly want more of the Chozo in it because, I mean, the only real story that any of us
1056140	1061260	got for the Chozo is in the manga, as I recall correctly.
1061260	1067340	If you want to discount like hints in Super Metroid, because I would say they were.
1067340	1068660	I mean, like real lore.
1068660	1070560	Yeah, I totally know what you mean.
1070560	1073860	But like, you know, in Super Metroid, they kind of became more than just the statue.
1073860	1076140	Like it was very clear there was more to them.
1076140	1077140	You know what I mean?
1077140	1078140	So, yeah.
1078140	1079140	Well, right.
1079140	1080140	Yeah.
1080140	1086620	If I recall correctly, I think it came out either before or around Super Metroid.
1086620	1093440	So I have to look that back up, but I'm glad that we're seeing some of them.
1093440	1097720	I almost wonder if this is some kind of prequel.
1097720	1101940	I don't think it's intended to be because you still have Prime serving as the prequels,
1101940	1103700	I think.
1103700	1106220	But anything's possible, really.
1106220	1108740	Like a pre-Metroid story.
1108740	1109740	Perhaps.
1109740	1112980	Bobby Black Wolf in chat says they're already making strats based on the trailer.
1112980	1115540	And I think he's referencing this comment from Tiger Claw.
1115540	1118940	Can't wait to see speedrunners take on this game and beat it under an hour.
1118940	1119940	I love that.
1119940	1122740	They're already strategizing based on the trailer.
1122740	1123740	Amazing.
1123740	1124740	So, yeah.
1124740	1125740	Yeah.
1125740	1127900	Sacred Jade in chat says, I thought this was a sequel to Fusion.
1127900	1131260	I think it is supposed to be like Metroid 5.
1131260	1140320	So if you consider Metroid slash Metroid Zero, Super Metroid, Metroid Fusion, I guess
1140320	1141900	Other M or am I missing one?
1141900	1143060	No, of course I'm missing one.
1143060	1144820	Samus 2 on the Game Boy, Return of Samus.
1144820	1146340	They don't count Other M. Sorry, I skipped one.
1146340	1151100	So it's Metroid, Return of Samus, then Super Metroid, then Fusion.
1151100	1152760	Now this is 5, Metroid.
1152760	1155660	So Other M has been thrown out of the canon.
1155660	1158260	So, so much for that.
1158260	1161040	All right.
1161040	1164120	One has a few things they're embarrassed about in their history.
1164120	1166960	I didn't think Other M was as bad as everyone else does.
1166960	1169580	Like it's, it's definitely different.
1169580	1170580	She's different.
1170580	1174480	Like that's, that's, that's my review of Metroid Other M. She's different.
1174480	1181040	Not as different as Federation Force, but you know, that's what, that's one we'd like
1181040	1182040	to forget.
1182040	1184160	Loki, we don't talk about Federation Force.
1184160	1186680	We just, that, that she, she passed away.
1186680	1190080	Like we don't talk about that one anymore.
1190120	1192400	All right, let's see.
1192400	1194380	So other stuff in the Nintendo Direct.
1194380	1195840	So we've got Metroid out of the way.
1195840	1197120	We got Samus out of the way.
1197120	1199340	Oh, I should mention this.
1199340	1201280	The Breath of the Wild 2 footage.
1201280	1207400	So I have been an insufferable bitch on this show saying that if Nintendo doesn't show
1207400	1211960	Breath of the Wild 2 footage, they're doing the fans a disservice.
1211960	1217280	And y'all in chat, especially Bobby Blackwell, have been saying no person in the history
1217280	1222200	of ever has not like pre-ordered or bought the game because they didn't show footage
1222200	1223200	at a certain event.
1223200	1225040	And I was like, I don't care.
1225040	1228440	Your facts are inconvenient and I reject them.
1228440	1234420	And my point is, is that Nintendo is disrespecting their fans by continuing to not give a Breath
1234420	1235500	of the Wild 2 update.
1235500	1240660	They need to give us at least a little something, a little piece, a little taste.
1240660	1245160	Just lick, let me lick the wall just once, okay?
1245160	1246920	And I think they did that.
1246920	1250960	I know some people are kind of disappointed with what little of Breath of the Wild 2 they
1250960	1251960	showed.
1251960	1255720	I'm going to actually, I will surprise you all and actually defend it and say that was
1255720	1257100	what I was talking about.
1257100	1258100	That was fine.
1258100	1259100	That was needed.
1259100	1260600	That was all the update we needed.
1260600	1261600	We're good.
1261600	1262600	Yeah, I think it was fine.
1262600	1263600	It looked great.
1263600	1264600	Mm-hmm.
1264600	1265600	So yeah.
1265600	1268580	Darktitsuyu in chat says, it was a brief tease, but I went away happy.
1268580	1270960	Can't wait to see what they do with the dual areas.
1270960	1271960	Absolutely.
1271960	1274800	Especially, are we getting the upside down castle in Breath of the Wild 2?
1274800	1277200	Because that's kind of cool.
1277200	1280160	Questbuster in chat says, I'm pretty excited on seeing what they had for Breath of the
1280160	1281160	Wild 2.
1281160	1284520	Did you notice those parallels to Skyward Sword?
1284520	1286560	I sure did.
1286560	1293160	Because that whole little blip started with Link falling through the sky just like a scene
1293160	1294600	in Skyward Sword.
1294600	1300760	And I'm laughing because I saw the most hilarious edit where somebody took that link flying
1300760	1302340	through the air thing.
1302340	1306500	And they photoshopped that instead of wearing pants, he's wearing a jockstrap.
1306500	1309380	So his ass is hanging out as he's flying through the air.
1309380	1312560	And I'm sorry, I'm immature and I thought it was really fucking funny.
1312560	1314620	So there's that.
1314620	1318060	But the Breath of the Wild footage was fun.
1318060	1321060	And it was also weird too, the show that, because they showed that like right after
1321060	1324600	the Skyward Sword HD or remaster thing.
1324600	1327900	So it was like, these are similar.
1327900	1330100	I don't know.
1330100	1335740	The way they set that whole segment up was a little bit of a misstep because they were
1335740	1339380	like, and here is the last game we have to talk about today.
1339380	1342380	And it went into Hyrule Warriors DLC.
1342380	1347580	And I was like sitting there going, fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, and fuck you for doing
1347580	1349700	the Hyrule Warriors last.
1349700	1353780	But then it kind of went into, then Anamora showed up and was like, let's talk about Zelda.
1353780	1356300	And I was like, oh, oh, okay, we're cool.
1356820	1363060	Oh, you're talking Zelda, the whole part, the whole piece, the whole story is the last
1363060	1364060	game of the day.
1364060	1365060	And I calmed down.
1365060	1368220	And so they did, of course, the Skyward Sword, Breath of the Wild 2, and that little Game
1368220	1370220	and Watch thing, which is interesting.
1370220	1371220	It's actually pretty cool.
1371220	1373020	It has three games on it.
1373020	1374020	Yeah.
1374020	1375180	And I like that.
1375180	1377820	I like that more than the Mario one, I think.
1377820	1382580	Yeah, I think because the Mario games, how do I say this nicely?
1382580	1385140	The Mario is kind of played out at this point.
1385900	1389580	Obviously, Super Mario Brothers is an epic, epic game.
1389580	1394100	But how many times and how many places do you need the original Super Mario Brothers
1394100	1395100	to be played?
1395100	1399380	I feel like there's going to be a version that comes out for refrigerators soon.
1399380	1401580	That is like how many places that shows up.
1401580	1405740	But the original Legend of Zelda, and especially like Zelda 2 Adventures of Link, the Game
1405740	1408200	Boy one too, those are some deeper cuts.
1408200	1411540	And I think that's nice to see those on the little Game and Watch.
1411540	1415060	I think the little clock thing looks cute, the way that you can play it.
1415060	1418700	So I'm more interested in the Zelda one than I was the Mario one.
1418700	1419700	I will say that.
1419700	1426340	So what are you going to do when they release the Metroid Game and Watch next year?
1426340	1430040	Shove it right in my ass, Loki.
1430040	1436900	I can see them doing like a Metroid, a Metroid, the Game Boy, Metroid Returns, and then just
1436900	1441780	for the hell of it, maybe throw in Kid Icarus or something like that.
1442420	1446860	Now you're just like throwing fanboy options out there.
1446860	1448420	Like yeah right, Kid Icarus.
1448420	1451140	Like Nintendo's going to acknowledge that franchise again.
1451140	1454660	First off, Sakurai's going to have to take a nap before we can even think about a new
1454660	1456020	Kid Icarus game.
1456020	1460500	And I don't know what's up with that, so yeah.
1460500	1462060	I would love that though, don't get me wrong.
1462060	1467120	Like a Metroid Kid Icarus Game and Watch, like a password pack Game and Watch, I'm all
1467120	1468120	about that.
1468120	1469120	That would be amazing.
1469120	1470440	With that silver color.
1470440	1474000	So alright, anyway.
1474000	1475640	Bobby says I'm on a butt kick today.
1475640	1476920	I said two things.
1476920	1477920	Come on.
1477920	1480960	What was I supposed to say to that?
1480960	1483320	Imagine they release your favorite game on a Game and Watch.
1483320	1484320	What are you going to do?
1484320	1485320	Of course I'm going to buy it.
1485320	1486840	If I can get one.
1486840	1487840	That is.
1487840	1494360	The funny thing is that I'm in so many other streamers groups that I have plenty of butt
1494360	1499280	icons to satisfy anybody.
1499720	1503000	You're very kind and generous with a lot of the Dead by Daylight streamers.
1503000	1505000	I see you sub to a lot of them.
1505000	1509100	And a lot of them have some nasty icons, so I don't know.
1509100	1511200	Some of those I'm like, how did that get through moderation?
1511200	1512200	So I'm always...
1512200	1514960	I'm having to be a little bit more judicious with who I sub to.
1514960	1515960	I understand.
1515960	1516960	I understand.
1516960	1520780	It's okay to have an occasional butt show up, you know?
1520780	1522080	It's just a butt.
1522080	1523080	Everybody has one.
1523080	1524080	Gosh.
1524080	1531080	Anyway, Darsakra, I have to ask you your thoughts on what little we saw, the little tease for
1531080	1534120	Breath of the Wild 2 and the Zelda stuff.
1534120	1537200	I'm exactly the same feeling as I was before.
1537200	1539260	I'm looking forward to it coming out.
1539260	1541300	This didn't really show me anything else.
1541300	1543640	Zelda fell down a hole.
1543640	1544640	We'll see.
1544640	1545640	All right.
1545640	1548760	Loki, why don't you walk us through some of the other things that they mentioned with
1548760	1550000	the Nintendo Direct?
1550000	1556160	Yeah, so actually kind of going back to the... even though you didn't like it, the Zelda
1556160	1560080	Hyrule Warriors DLC looked actually pretty cool, where you can actually play as the guardian
1560080	1561080	stuff.
1561080	1563960	So my son's excited about that, at least.
1563960	1568680	Other things that they talked about, they have a new Mario Party Superstars coming out.
1568680	1570720	That's going to be a collection of the mini games.
1570720	1575140	I think they did something similar already, but I guess it's now more.
1575140	1576560	It's like the greatest hits album.
1576560	1578760	Yeah, but they did that, though, with like the...
1578760	1580920	It was like Mario Party Gold or something like that.
1580920	1582720	I thought that came out already.
1582720	1587560	I think the big thing about this one is that it's all online now, because they finally
1587560	1591040	figured out that people can play Mario Party online and how to do that.
1591040	1592720	They figured it out online finally.
1592720	1594180	That's good.
1594180	1600120	They talked about the new DLC character for Smash Brothers, which is going to be Kazuya
1600120	1602620	Mishima from Tekken.
1602620	1603620	So that's cool.
1603620	1606200	We got all these fighting games kind of mixed together.
1606200	1608640	We're almost to Urgites, almost.
1608640	1616240	Apparently Heihachi is part of the temple level.
1616240	1617240	What else?
1617240	1621920	We got confirmation that Guardians of the Galaxy was also coming to the Switch, as well
1621920	1625800	as some other Switch games that we kind of figured were also coming.
1625800	1634640	So Two Point Campus, Just Dance 2022, Worms Rumble, Dragon Ball Z, Kakarot, and New Power
1634680	1637520	Awakens, part one and two.
1637520	1639160	So that's a long title.
1639160	1644200	A new Super Monkey Ball, Banana Mania, that's going to be a collection that's coming as
1644200	1645200	well.
1645200	1651640	Shimagami Tensei V, and what else?
1651640	1654400	New collection of Danganronpa games.
1654400	1655400	What?
1655400	1656400	Yep.
1656400	1657400	Yep.
1657400	1664120	It's Danganronpa Decadence, it's Trigger Happy Havoc, Danganronpa 2, V3, and the new
1664600	1667600	Danganronpa S Ultimate Summer Camp.
1667600	1668600	Yay.
1668600	1673760	We've got a 3D Advance Wars remake, so that was kind of cool.
1673760	1677920	Oh yeah, that was very unexpected, in my opinion.
1677920	1681440	I was not expecting an Advance Wars remake, I'm not complaining.
1681440	1686400	It's not a series I super got into, but I know it is loved, I know people really appreciate
1686400	1687400	that.
1687400	1689560	I'm excited to see it.
1689560	1691280	And then, what else?
1691280	1695800	Fatal Frame is also coming, it's a Fatal Frame made out of black water.
1695800	1697760	That was kind of a surprise as well.
1697760	1702520	So yeah, I think Nintendo had a great direct, I really do.
1702520	1710440	You know, it wasn't like my face melted off, it was so amazing, but I walked out of it
1710440	1714880	going okay, I see what games I'm going to be playing this holiday and I'm going to have
1714880	1715880	fun with it.
1715880	1718360	And video games should be fun, yay.
1718360	1724320	So I was above, more than satisfied, we'll say that.
1724320	1727560	Alright, so there's the Nintendo Direct Recap.
1727560	1732360	Before we close the book on E3, Loki, am I missing anything else with the show itself
1732360	1736600	like isn't coming up later in our show or something that needs to be brought up?
1736600	1740120	I think we touched on everything, but I'm worried I missed something.
1740120	1744840	If there's something, then I missed it too, because E3 is hard, because there's a ton
1744840	1747880	of announcements and they're all over the place.
1748400	1751120	Should we say something about that in television presentation?
1751120	1754800	I didn't watch it, but I kind of read about it.
1754800	1756280	I watched it.
1756280	1758120	I still have a system pre-ordered.
1758120	1761200	I ordered them when they first came out.
1761200	1764440	I think the direction the system is taking is interesting.
1764440	1768240	They're really going to need the games to back it up, and I think they're really going
1768240	1773160	to need to show solid games that aren't just like, oh, I could do this on my cell phone.
1773160	1776840	They kind of have that opportunity with like, say, Earthworm Jim.
1776920	1781560	I think the whole, even though that series has its own issues, but I'm not going to go there.
1781560	1785720	But the Echo the Dolphin thing was a lot more exciting, not that series itself,
1785720	1787640	but the creators are making like a new game.
1788440	1792760	I think that now that's the kind of stuff where I'm like, OK, and television could have
1792760	1797640	a very interesting niche there if they get some of these like retro developers to come
1797640	1799560	back and do like a new thing.
1800600	1804200	I think that could be very because, you know, a lot of retro developers are kind of I think
1804200	1808040	we were talking a little bit about this with the Ken and Roberta Williams story last week
1808040	1813160	or the week before was that it's harder to develop a game now with, you know, one person
1813160	1815480	or a small team than it was back in the day.
1815480	1820600	But I think in television kind of opens up that possibility again a little bit because
1820600	1821880	of the rules for its system.
1821880	1824360	It almost lends itself better to small dev teams.
1824360	1828040	So I wonder if they're going to attract some of the retro devs a little more often.
1828040	1828920	I think they could be interesting.
1828920	1833560	Quest Buster in chat says the Amico presentation was neat.
1833560	1837480	Tallarico really emphasized that they weren't in competition with the big three.
1837480	1840120	They just want to be another fun option in addition to those.
1840120	1842200	And that's absolutely the right path to take.
1842840	1847880	But gaming, there's so much gaming that is outside just the big three.
1847880	1851000	I mean, hello, cell phones is huge.
1851800	1856440	But even now, you know, between arcade one up cabinets and little mini cabinets like
1856440	1860600	that Street Fighter one that Alan brought me in the middle of the show last week, you
1860600	1865400	know, there's there's other ways to kind of check games out that aren't just like your
1865400	1866920	traditional kind of system as well.
1866920	1868760	Games are baked into TVs now.
1868760	1870600	You know, it's it's the cloud gaming.
1870600	1871100	It is.
1871960	1874440	Gaming is kind of going beyond just the big three.
1874440	1876840	So I think it's very, very interesting.
1876840	1877560	SSJ 100.
1877560	1880600	Matt says put Pixel Poops on Amico, Tommy.
1880600	1885320	I've been saying to YYR he needs to I think I don't know.
1885560	1888600	I feel like he might have at least tried to like send an email.
1888600	1894760	I don't know if the email got anywhere, but I know like I think I think YYR's games, not
1894760	1899320	just Pixel Poops, but the types of games he develops like super multitasking like Amico
1899320	1900840	would be such a good platform for that.
1901640	1906680	So I'd be curious to see like what what's involved with developing for that.
1906680	1910840	Like I don't know what frameworks and stuff that it's supported on there.
1910840	1915640	I don't really know what the Intellivision Amico can do and like hardware wise.
1915640	1917320	So like how do I develop for that?
1917320	1919160	So I would love information on that, but.
1920280	1922440	I mean, they have an email address.
1922440	1923080	That's about it.
1924040	1928440	Bobby Blackwolf in chat says Pixel Poops wouldn't go on the Amico because of the subject matter.
1928440	1929720	Other YYR games might.
1930360	1931480	I have the fix for you.
1931480	1932440	Here you go.
1932440	1935560	Because they're little brown piles, you're just going to call them pixel dumps.
1935560	1937080	And that's what it's pixel dumps.
1937080	1941560	And you're just going to and you change the taco stand to a pixel store and you're just
1941560	1942760	dumping pixels on the ground.
1943560	1944120	That's there.
1944120	1944600	There you go.
1945400	1948600	See, I made YYR's game Christian friendly.
1948600	1949160	How about that?
1950360	1952600	Pixel pocket says you could make it ice cream.
1952600	1953480	Oh my God.
1953480	1957080	It would be like the sweat on Mortal Kombat.
1957080	1962600	So now my God, instead of little brown piles on the ground, it would just be little pink
1962600	1964600	piles and it's strawberry ice cream.
1964600	1968680	And then the little taco cabana turns into ice cream cabana.
1969320	1970200	There you go.
1970200	1970700	Done.
1974200	1975000	Oh my God.
1975960	1977880	YYR, not to give you more work.
1979080	1981560	But like Pixel Poops now needs a strawberry code.
1982120	1987800	Or like if you put down right up left YB, it changes it to strawberry ice cream.
1987800	1993400	Orange right says people will be searching for the poop code.
1994200	1994520	All right.
1994520	1996040	Anyway, let's move on.
1996600	2000760	But please check it if you if you are newer to Orange Launch Radio and you don't understand
2000760	2002360	why we're obsessed with Pixel Poops.
2002920	2008200	It's actually a game that we well, Jamie created and we take credit for.
2008920	2011720	But Jamie's kind of said this on the show once.
2011720	2015560	You know, we have this list of dream games that's on our wiki and she threw out that
2015560	2015960	idea.
2015960	2020360	And then YYR, one of our listeners slash fav game developers ran with it, actually put
2020360	2022040	out a game called Pixel Poops.
2022040	2027640	And then like if that wasn't enough, then Loki was like, hey, I'm going to make a Pixel
2027640	2029080	Poops game on the NES.
2029080	2032360	You know, I've always I've been teasing, making a game for literally six years on the
2032360	2032680	show.
2032680	2037640	And then he releases Pixel Poops 2 on the NES maker.
2037640	2039880	And it's available on itch.io and Steam.
2040280	2046760	Which I do need to update that to the special editions, because there's stuff, you know,
2046760	2052040	more levels and everything and more characters and other things.
2052920	2058040	I just haven't quite trying to combine that with uploading YouTube stuff every week or
2058040	2060600	trying to do it every week is that stuff.
2060600	2064360	But I still want to do that because I have cartridges and I've got labels now.
2064360	2064840	I can't wait.
2064840	2066440	So physical editions.
2066440	2067560	Yeah, I can't wait.
2068040	2071160	That's going to be the must have OLR collectors item, that's for sure.
2071160	2076280	All right, let's move on and get into our gaming weeks and the types of video games
2076280	2080760	that we have been playing this week, whether it's Pixel Dumps or otherwise.
2080760	2082520	Dark Sakura, how was your gaming week?
2085320	2087080	You're muted on hard mute on Discord.
2089960	2090520	There we go.
2090520	2091000	There we go.
2091000	2092040	It was all right.
2092040	2095800	I played lots of Dead by Daylight.
2096360	2097640	I played some Pinball.
2100040	2100760	Wardscapes.
2101720	2102520	That's it.
2102520	2103480	No Animal Crossing.
2104040	2105160	No Animal Crossing?
2105880	2107240	Two weeks without.
2107240	2108200	Oh, no.
2108200	2109400	Is this the beginning of the end?
2110120	2111080	No, I don't think so.
2111080	2113000	I just think that I've been really busy.
2113640	2114200	Understandable.
2114200	2117800	I'm also surprised, too, like kind of going back to Nintendo Direct, that we didn't hear
2117800	2119240	any updates on Animal Crossing.
2120520	2121800	Yeah, it's a little bit surprising, too.
2121800	2124520	I think like no like version update or something.
2125240	2128120	Maybe that's coming to like Nintendo Direct or something.
2128120	2129000	Yeah, yeah.
2129000	2130680	And also, I didn't watch Treehouse.
2130680	2133160	They have a lot of stuff, you know, that sometimes they announce in Treehouse.
2133160	2134200	So maybe it was in there.
2134200	2137080	I think if they announced something that big, it would have been all over Twitter.
2137800	2140120	So we've already would have had that.
2140120	2142760	So I think it's just not.
2142760	2145880	Yeah, I think if they do anything, it'll be in a separate direct later on or like
2146520	2147720	they'll do maybe a direct.
2147720	2151880	I don't want to set expectations unreasonably, but maybe they'll do like in I was gonna say
2151880	2155080	an indie game direct, but I'm not sure Animal Crossing would fit in with that.
2155080	2159880	So maybe some type of a mini direct that gives updates on a lot of indies and then an Animal
2159880	2163880	Crossing surprise thrown in there and maybe maybe one other game that gets DLC or something.
2163880	2165080	So all right.
2166520	2168840	Let's let's move on to Loki and your gaming week.
2170040	2172520	Well, it's been Minecraft still.
2172520	2177000	So actually, a lot of this week was editing, but still a lot of Minecraft.
2177000	2185160	And just basically working on designing the structure that I'm building for inspired by
2185160	2187960	the session I had with Tango Tech last week.
2187960	2192200	So just kind of working on that, it's going to I decided originally the concept I had
2192200	2195960	pitched to him when I was doing it was like, OK, we're going to build a skyscraper type
2195960	2200600	thing, but instead I'm going with like a industrial factory.
2200600	2203560	So I've been working on that, doing the redstone for that.
2204360	2205400	So that'll be coming soon.
2205400	2207240	I tease at the end of my video.
2207240	2209560	And so that's what I'm working on.
2210200	2211960	And we had to be continuing to work on this week.
2211960	2216600	I'm actually taking some time off from work because because it's not work.
2217400	2220520	So to play some more during the week.
2220520	2221800	So I'll be doing that.
2221800	2224440	And I do want to get back into streaming some more as well.
2224440	2230040	But it's hard to stream when we have cats yelling at us down at their feet.
2232600	2233100	But yeah.
2233960	2234460	All right.
2235100	2238300	My gaming week, I don't really have new games to talk about.
2238300	2241980	Sadly, I know I was supposed to get on Game Pass to get like Yakuza like a dragon and
2241980	2245580	some of the other stuff, but our bandwidth is a little tight right at the moment.
2245580	2248780	And I've just I've just been kind of enjoying the games that I have still.
2248780	2252060	I've actually been playing No Man's Sky again, which is weird because there's not
2252060	2257100	another mission, a special timed mission in there right now.
2257740	2261340	But I want to work on the achievements that I'm missing in that game, because it's really
2261340	2264220	ridiculous that I talk so much about this game and I don't have all the achievements
2265020	2266220	So I really need to work on those.
2266220	2267900	So that's kind of been my goal in No Man's Sky.
2268540	2270540	I've been continuing in Final Fantasy 14.
2270540	2272700	In fact, I did at least one stream this week.
2272700	2273820	There might have been two.
2273820	2277740	I can't remember anymore, but I know I did one just last night and I've been working
2277740	2281420	on some of the classes that are not level 80 yet, building them up.
2281420	2284940	So like my warrior is one of my last jobs.
2284940	2289180	I have to get to level 80 and I got that to level 51 on stream last night.
2289180	2290060	So that was pretty cool.
2291020	2293660	And then continuing in Dead by Daylight a little bit.
2293660	2294860	I just play a little bit every day.
2295660	2297660	Shout out to my husband, Alan Alchemy.
2297660	2300380	He did a stream earlier today for Dead by Daylight.
2300380	2304620	He did his first cosplay stream where he actually dressed up as one of the characters, Ace.
2304620	2308220	He bought all this stuff online that he dressed up as the character.
2308220	2310940	You can check it out on his channel at Alan Alchemy.
2310940	2313500	I'm pretty sure his VODs are all open and he has clips too.
2314060	2318380	And I thought that was really adorable that he really poured himself into that.
2318380	2323580	He actually grew out his facial hair a certain way so he could do the cosplay authentically.
2324620	2326380	That's pretty awesome.
2326380	2327020	Yeah, right.
2327020	2331820	So and I told him you need to go to Dragon Con so you can use some of these cosplays again.
2332780	2338220	I think Alan may be into the idea of Dragon Con next year.
2338220	2342220	This year's a little too soon and kind of like this year has been being played.
2342220	2346060	It's not necessarily the COVID thing, but it's that this year has been being planned
2346060	2347580	since 2019.
2347580	2349660	So it's a little hard for Alan to get it on that.
2349660	2351980	But he's talking about maybe 2022.
2351980	2355100	He's actually going to come, especially if he sticks with the streaming things.
2355100	2356300	That would be really exciting, I think.
2358060	2360540	And then I feel like I'm missing something for my gaming week,
2360540	2363660	but it's a lot of the stuff I've talked about before on this show.
2363660	2366140	I didn't really play anything new this week.
2366940	2370140	Maybe in the next week I'll finally get the Yakuza like a dragon.
2371260	2374060	Although I'm actually going to be gone for a couple days next weekend.
2375580	2378940	Not to toot my own horn, but next weekend is my birthday.
2378940	2380620	So I'm going to be out of town.
2380620	2383580	I'm going to be getting back just in time for O.L.R. on Sunday.
2383580	2385260	So it's going to be a rush show next week.
2385260	2386540	So that'll be fun.
2386540	2387040	So, yeah.
2387660	2388540	All right.
2388540	2392540	Speaking of special show stuff, before I get to the next story,
2392540	2394460	one thing I want to make sure you all know about,
2394460	2396060	if you haven't seen on Twitter yet,
2397020	2401740	Loki Dark Sakura and myself are going to be doing a very special presentation
2401740	2404460	on Wednesday is the 23rd, right?
2404460	2405660	If I did my math right.
2405660	2411020	So Wednesday night at 7 p.m. Pacific, 10 p.m. Eastern,
2411020	2414540	we are going to be doing a special stream here at VOG Network
2414540	2417980	where we listen to Orange Lounge Radio episode one.
2418620	2421340	And not going to lie, it's going to be a little cringe
2421340	2423820	because we've come a long way in 19 years.
2423820	2427740	But that's kind of what it's all about is celebrating how far this show has come
2428620	2430460	in the 19 years that we've been on the air.
2430460	2432780	So that is a channel point reward.
2432780	2436220	You guys raised the points for the live folks here at Twitch.tv
2436780	2438940	and it was our highest channel point reward ever.
2438940	2441020	And you guys still raised 150,000 points.
2441020	2442780	So we're going to do that special stream for you guys.
2442780	2447100	And the Wednesday date is specifically chosen.
2447100	2452860	It's intentional because June 23rd was the first Orange Lounge Radio.
2452860	2456780	Obviously, what day falls on what day of the week changes from year to year.
2456780	2459580	So June 23rd was a Sunday in 2002.
2459580	2460860	It's going to be a Wednesday this year,
2460860	2463820	but that will be the actual 19th birthday.
2463820	2465340	And Dartetsuya in chat says,
2465340	2468540	Didn't the show originally start at 7?
2468540	2470380	It started at 6.30.
2470380	2472060	So I'm glad you brought that up.
2472060	2476220	Orange Lounge Radio's original time was 6.30 to 8.30.
2476220	2477740	It was a two-hour show.
2478300	2482940	And then when we were not able to contain ourselves to two hours,
2482940	2483980	it was 6 to 9.
2484700	2487340	So and insert your own joke about 6 and 9 here.
2488060	2490060	So yeah, it was 6.30 to 8.30 when it first started.
2490060	2492860	So yeah, that is kind of interesting is that when we listen to the show,
2493580	2495500	it's only going to be two hours worth of show.
2495500	2498300	And there were music breaks in the beginning.
2498300	2501180	So and for obvious reasons, we're not going to play those music breaks.
2501180	2505820	We're going to kind of use our skip ahead on the music breaks to just get to the talking parts.
2505820	2510220	So the talking itself may only be about an hour, an hour 15.
2510220	2515100	I don't remember the ratio of music to talking in the early shows.
2515100	2519180	So we will cover all that on Wednesday.
2519180	2524140	I still have to figure out how to play an MP3 so you guys can hear it while I'm broadcasting it.
2524140	2526300	So I better figure that out before Wednesday.
2527660	2528160	All right.
2529500	2531180	Anyhow, one other shout out.
2531180	2533660	Sorry, I know we won't get into gaming news, but I have some shout outs this week.
2533660	2535180	I need to make sure I get this one out on air
2536060	2538860	because you can check it out over on their YouTube channel.
2538860	2544940	The Dragon Con Digital Media Track did a special kind of spotlight show
2544940	2546940	that I was lucky enough to be a guest on.
2547500	2550780	That was a week ago, but you can now watch on YouTube.
2551500	2554860	You can watch the interview that Mike did with me.
2555660	2559420	And we just talked about, you know, doing a show for 19 years
2559420	2562140	and talked a little bit about this upcoming Dragon Con.
2562140	2563580	And we talked a little bit about, you know,
2563580	2566780	how has the motivation been there for so long and all that stuff.
2566780	2571260	So I want to just kind of give that a shout out.
2571260	2575580	The link is in the VOG Network Discord over at vognetwork.com slash Discord.
2575580	2578460	Since it's a YouTube link, I can't really read it on air
2578460	2581020	because, you know, it just has random numbers and letters at the end of it.
2581020	2583260	But please be on the lookout for that or just check out.
2583260	2586460	Just do like, you know, Dragon Con Digital Media Rob Roberts.
2586460	2587900	You'll find it if you do a search there.
2587900	2588460	So look for that.
2589100	2590540	And then Bobby is asking me to plug.
2590540	2591020	Oh, thank you.
2591020	2593900	I actually linked it there in chat for the live folks.
2593900	2594140	Thank you.
2594140	2595340	Thank you for those in the podcast.
2595340	2596140	Just do a search for it.
2596140	2596640	You'll find it.
2598060	2599340	And then Bobby Black Wolf says,
2599340	2602220	Oh, and plug Summer Games Done Quick Real Quick 2.
2602780	2605260	Monday early morning and the Saturday night finale.
2605740	2609100	I don't think I need to plug Summer Games Done Quick because everybody knows about it.
2609100	2611100	If you don't know about Summer Games Done Quick,
2611100	2613260	hello, welcome to video game culture.
2613260	2617100	There is a very big video game event that happens in the summer and in the winter.
2617100	2619020	And in the winter, it's called Awesome Games Done Quick.
2619020	2621020	And in the summer, it's called Summer Games Done Quick.
2621020	2624060	They raise money for charity by doing games quickly.
2624060	2628620	It's not just a clever title, but the speed running community is awesome.
2628620	2630860	The commentary they do is great.
2632220	2632720	Excuse me.
2633600	2639120	And since it is a charity fundraising thing, there are donations that come in
2639120	2642880	and somebody has to read those donations and give shout outs live on air.
2642880	2647840	And one of those many talented somebodies that brings it all together for Summer Games Done Quick
2647840	2650480	is going to be VOG Network's own Bobby Black Wolf.
2650480	2654080	And so he will be doing some announcing Monday early, early morning.
2654720	2657440	Maybe depending on your time zone, it may not be quite the same.
2657440	2661360	I would say if you're Europe, this is a great chance to catch Bobby Black Wolf
2661360	2663680	because that'll be middle of the day for you guys.
2663680	2668960	But he's got a block of games on Monday that I know includes Star Tropics 2, I think.
2668960	2673040	And I know the original Batman on NES is in there as well and some other games as well.
2673040	2676960	But then the big, big one that Bobby's doing, we're really thrilled for him.
2676960	2680640	And, you know, it's just for the speed run in general because it's going to be great.
2680640	2684400	Bobby's hosting the finale, which is Kingdom Hearts 2 this year.
2684400	2687840	So he'll be there at the very, very end of it all on Saturday night.
2687840	2689280	So that is going to be awesome.
2689360	2693840	So congrats to Bobby and best of luck to everybody at the Summer Games Done Quick.
2693840	2701600	And I believe that is the 4th of July weekend coming up when that all starts.
2703600	2704640	Remind me of the date real quick.
2704640	2708880	I know it's not next week, but I think it's the week after.
2709600	2712480	So if somebody wants to remind me of the date when that starts.
2712480	2712800	Thank you.
2712800	2714720	Bobby says it's July 4th through 11th.
2714720	2715440	Okay, that's what I thought.
2715440	2717280	I thought it started the weekend of July 4th.
2717280	2719520	Okay, so yeah, be looking out for that.
2719520	2720560	Okay, now we can get the news.
2720560	2721600	I'm done with all the announcements.
2721600	2722400	There was a lot tonight.
2722400	2724960	So that was our own E3 direct right there.
2724960	2725840	There you go.
2725840	2726880	All right, let's move on.
2728160	2729680	Loki, why don't you start us off tonight?
2730960	2731360	All right.
2731920	2739840	So starting off, you know, there was some, I guess, issues with the demo for the new
2739840	2743120	Final Fantasy game that's Strangers in Paradise.
2743920	2752560	So apparently that there was some issues with game corruption or where there's a gate that
2752560	2754480	was corrupted or something like that.
2754480	2762400	So they've, I guess, been able to unable to boot the game and running into different issues
2762400	2765840	with it, which is not a good way to present your game.
2765840	2766400	No, it is not.
2767600	2768320	Even though, yes.
2769280	2773040	Sorry, I just I need to get on my tangent about bandwidth caps again.
2773040	2775520	Because people were burning that game download.
2775520	2778560	And then it's like I wasted my bandwidth for literally nothing.
2778560	2783440	Now, if I'm not mistaken, you didn't have to re-download the entire thing to fix it.
2783440	2784880	Am I correct, Bobby?
2784880	2787600	Because I don't have PS5 still.
2787600	2788960	Maybe that'll be fixed this holiday.
2788960	2789920	We'll see.
2789920	2790880	I don't have PS5 still.
2790880	2791280	So I don't know.
2791280	2794880	Did you have to re-download all 11 gigs or did something kind of trigger on the back
2794880	2796800	end where it just figured it out?
2799040	2801360	Bobby Blackwell says the patch was not 11 gigs.
2801360	2803360	OK, so at least they didn't have to re-download everything.
2803360	2804400	That's good, at least.
2804400	2805200	But they did it.
2805200	2808480	They did at least fix it, though, earlier this week.
2808480	2811040	So that was that was nice that that happened.
2811040	2815280	But still, like, you know, kind of test that before you publish it.
2815280	2816640	That's embarrassing.
2816640	2820000	That's embarrassing for not just Square, but Sony.
2820000	2822560	And just like the PlayStation 5 is a platform.
2822560	2827600	Sorry, I'm not trying to be a jerk, but that's a really embarrassing mistake.
2827600	2830880	Like, how was this not tested?
2830880	2833280	What this would look like on a retail PS5?
2833280	2836480	I mean, I'm sure it was tested on dev PS5s.
2836480	2839120	How was this not tested on a retail PS5?
2840400	2844640	It's possible, like if there's some sort of corruption with it, maybe that, you know,
2844640	2850080	copying something or maybe the transfer to like the server or something caused an issue.
2850080	2853600	And so, you know, maybe it was fine on their end, but then they had the I don't know.
2854160	2855680	But it is still annoying.
2856400	2858880	It's it's it's ridiculous how that all went down.
2859440	2863840	Quest Buster in chat says one could say the demo was fraught with chaos.
2864960	2866800	Bobby Blackwell says I played it.
2866800	2870480	They did have an easy mode, but it's a souls like and it kind of proves why Souls games
2870480	2872640	should not have an easy mode because it's kind of boring.
2874080	2875840	I got bored and turned it off at some point.
2875840	2876880	It was just too repetitive.
2877600	2882240	No one special 77s in chat and says so Squeenix tossed the demo of Phoenix down.
2882240	2884480	Well, they I think they kind of had to because that's
2884480	2887200	I mean, it's one thing when your demos bad.
2887200	2890000	It's another when your demo just straight up done work.
2891360	2895600	Can you imagine back in the day, Loki, if you'd bought one of those PlayStation magazines
2895600	2899920	with the demo disk and you put the demo disk in your drive and it just goes corrupt file error?
2899920	2900420	Sorry.
2901680	2903280	Yeah, people would be upset.
2903280	2904800	People would be a little bit upset.
2904800	2908800	I get that it's different now, but it's I just can't believe that happened.
2908800	2909760	Or like one of those.
2909760	2913120	What was it where you got the Final Fantasy seven demo with like, yeah,
2913200	2916480	Brave Fencer, Masashi, like that file error.
2916480	2916980	Yes.
2917600	2918100	Whoops.
2918880	2922000	That was that's that's really just embarrassing for everyone involved.
2922000	2922800	I'm sorry.
2922800	2924320	Anyway, all right.
2924320	2926160	At some point, I'll get a PlayStation five.
2927440	2930800	I don't think my birthday I'm going to get one for that, but maybe the holidays.
2932400	2934560	Anyway, let's move on and talk.
2935440	2936000	Sorry, guys.
2936880	2941200	Let's talk a little bit about Niantic, the creators of the game Pokemon Go,
2941200	2943520	which I've talked a couple times about on this show.
2943520	2945200	They make other games as well.
2945200	2948400	Ingress I've talked a little bit about, even though I think that game is kind of lesser known.
2948400	2951120	But Ingress is that was their first big game and still,
2951760	2954560	I was going to say is still popular, but that might kind of be a lie.
2954560	2955760	So is still played.
2955760	2956560	We'll say that.
2956560	2959120	It's still popular among the people that still play the game.
2959120	2961200	Yeah, it's still popular with some people.
2961840	2964400	And I would say also Harry Potter, Wizards Unite.
2964400	2967360	I'm not sure how well that game is doing, but I think it's well enough.
2967360	2968080	It's still going.
2969040	2971280	I kind of stopped playing that a long time ago,
2971280	2974160	but I know others that still play it and are into it.
2974160	2975440	So there's that.
2975440	2977040	Those are all the Niantic games that are out now.
2977680	2981920	Niantic has also previously announced they are working on a Settlers of Catan game.
2982720	2983600	That is still not out.
2983600	2987360	I think that one's being tested in New Zealand or something, but that game is still not out.
2988320	2992000	They also announced very recently they are working on a Pikmin game,
2992000	2995360	or at least some type of exploration with Pikmin type of app.
2995360	2997760	We're not sure exactly if that means like a game
2997760	3000560	or maybe something where you're collecting like things from.
3000560	3004720	We don't know what that is yet, but we know Niantic is doing something with Pikmin.
3006160	3011120	Well, it was also announced this week Niantic's got another project in the works.
3011120	3015680	A Transformers game is the next game coming from Niantic.
3015680	3020880	Now this sounds like it might be a little more when I say is coming from Niantic.
3020880	3024800	This might be a little more like Niantic and Wizards Unite,
3024800	3029920	where I actually think Wizards Unite is actively developed by Portkey Games,
3029920	3031920	which is a subsidiary of Warner Brothers.
3031920	3039760	They handle all the Harry Potter stuff and they use Niantic's network of AR portals and ARs.
3039760	3044000	I say portals because they, you know, built that all on the labor of ingress players
3044000	3049120	and now Pokemon Go players a little bit as well, which is why it got worse, but I digress.
3049120	3053040	I have to ask because now it's been like a long time.
3053040	3054720	Yes, an undetermined long time.
3055360	3059280	So they've finally given you any sort of perks for, you know,
3059280	3061280	prestige or whatever in ingress.
3062880	3071040	If you have their $5 a month sub or whatever it is, then you get one set of rewards if you're
3071040	3075120	unrecursed and you get a slightly better set of rewards if you have recursed.
3075120	3079040	But that involves you have to have their $5 a month sub to see that.
3079840	3080400	That's lame.
3081120	3085120	Yeah, I wish the reward was better for the recursion.
3085120	3087360	I, you know, that's ingress.
3087360	3088960	And you know what, though?
3088960	3091840	You know, as much as I joke about ingress is kind of like, you know,
3091840	3094720	it's not really at the level it used to be and all that they are.
3094720	3097840	They have announced they are going to start bringing live events back,
3098640	3102720	you know, with COVID restrictions, having lessened and vaccines being readily available
3102720	3103280	if you want it.
3103280	3107200	And again, we here at OLR would encourage all of you to get your vaccinations.
3107200	3109360	We've all gotten ours and we're fine.
3110240	3114960	And yeah, and far less of a chance to spread COVID when we have that.
3114960	3117920	But anyhow, so they're going to be bringing back live events again.
3117920	3123200	And I think they're doing a van event in Oakland July 9th.
3123200	3125280	That's just like a social get together.
3126160	3129200	But I think they're doing a mission day on July 11th.
3129200	3132000	And that, again, is kind of like you check in at a spot,
3132000	3135680	but you're really going outside and exploring the town and doing missions and getting.
3135680	3137120	So I think there's that.
3137120	3142800	And then they are saying in-person anomalies or some other type of in-person PVP events,
3142800	3147200	maybe not necessarily anomaly, but some other type of event is going to be coming back.
3148080	3149360	It sounds like this year.
3149360	3151120	So that's kind of exciting as well.
3151120	3152480	So we'll see.
3153200	3153520	All right.
3154160	3157840	Anyway, back to the Transformers game before we got on a tangent there.
3157840	3163520	I was saying that I think this Transformers game is like the Harry Potter game in that
3163600	3166160	Niantic is not the one really actively developing it,
3166160	3171840	but they are lending their AR expertise and their layout of the world to this game.
3171840	3175360	Because admittedly, it does work better when you have games,
3175360	3177120	because there's been a lot of Pokemon Go,
3177120	3181280	like rip off games where it's been randomly generated, so to speak.
3183120	3184640	And it doesn't usually work out as well.
3184640	3184960	I don't know.
3184960	3187840	Some people really love that Jurassic Park game.
3187840	3189520	Oh, the Transformers game?
3189520	3190160	Heck yeah.
3190160	3190720	Heck yeah.
3190720	3191360	Right.
3191360	3192960	So Transformers.
3192960	3196560	Transformers Heavy Metal is supposed to launch globally this year.
3196560	3199760	They're going to soft launch it in some countries soon.
3199760	3202000	And I guarantee those some countries are Australia,
3202000	3204800	New Zealand, because that's where all the Niantic stuff gets piloted.
3205680	3210560	Seattle-based studio Very Very Spaceship is leading development on this.
3210560	3211280	So that's why...
3211280	3212400	I love the name of that studio.
3212400	3213200	Yeah, I know, right?
3213200	3216560	That's why I said, I don't think it's actually Niantic,
3216560	3218320	but there's kind of that going on.
3218880	3219680	How does this work?
3219680	3221040	Here's the description.
3221040	3222640	In Transformers Heavy Metal...
3223200	3226320	Heavy Metal makes me think of the anime from the 80s, actually.
3226320	3228160	That's why I'm in Transformers game.
3228160	3228640	Yeah, right.
3229680	3233280	In Transformers Heavy Metal, players will join the Guardian Network,
3233280	3238560	a group of humans who have banded together with the Autobots in a war against the Decepticons.
3238560	3244240	As a Guardian, players will uncover hidden regions across Earth to find resources and
3244240	3249120	battle Decepticons in turn-based battles, either solo or with friends.
3249120	3251920	The only disappointing part about that description is that it
3251920	3256160	sounds like I will not be able to be a Decepticon or root for the Decepticons.
3256960	3258560	That is the only unfortunate news.
3260400	3262320	But okay, I'll still try it.
3263600	3266960	Pretty much any AR game, and I mean any AR game,
3266960	3270640	because I've played some fucking trash AR games, Garfield Go.
3270640	3274160	I've played some really fucking trash AR games.
3275120	3276560	I'll try it at least once.
3276560	3281680	Just because I love the concept of real-world location AR games.
3281680	3285680	I realize AR could also mean hollow lens type stuff,
3285680	3288960	where literally the environment around you and what you're seeing is different.
3288960	3293360	And I think Niantic is headed that direction if you look at some of their prototype stuff.
3293360	3295680	But we're not there yet with these cell phone games.
3295680	3298160	So it'll be very interesting.
3298160	3299280	So, all right.
3301840	3303440	Bobby Blackwell from chat says,
3303520	3307840	actually, heavy metal wasn't an anime because it was made in the US by Ivan Reitman.
3308400	3310080	And then I agree with Dark Sakura.
3310080	3312560	Technically, anime stands for animation,
3312560	3315920	and US animation is referred to as anime in Japan.
3315920	3316420	HA!
3318080	3322960	I mean, there are tons of words that are really just shortened versions.
3322960	3324880	Like, Terebi is television.
3326080	3327040	I'm gonna be honest.
3327040	3331520	I called it an anime because even if it was developed, it kind of looks like an anime to me.
3331680	3334400	And I realize that's also very different.
3334400	3338640	So, heavy metal is an interesting movie because back in the day, here we go.
3339600	3341760	You ready for grandpa to tell a story?
3341760	3345440	Back in the day, Dark Sakura and Loki, you'll appreciate this,
3345440	3347440	at the Birdcage Cinemas back in the day.
3348800	3350480	And then these Sacramento locals.
3350480	3352320	Back in the day at the Birdcage Cinema,
3352320	3355040	when we used to do the Rocky Horror Picture Show at midnight,
3355760	3359520	the midnight movie, the Rocky Horror Picture Show played in theater one.
3359520	3361360	You know what played in theater two?
3361360	3362880	Every weekend at midnight?
3362880	3363600	Heavy metal.
3364160	3368000	So I know that movie very well from back in the day.
3369040	3370400	Do you want to know what's funny?
3370400	3371040	What's funny?
3372000	3375120	I was sneaked in to see it in 1981.
3375120	3376640	Oh my god, that's amazing.
3377440	3378640	I didn't know what was going on.
3378640	3381200	I think I fell asleep, but I remembered the...
3382800	3385040	I just remember asking, is that John Candy?
3387040	3388400	Because he did a voice.
3388400	3391360	I remember for a short while, for sure, I'd say about a year,
3391360	3394160	they did Austin Powers Man of Mystery in theater three.
3395520	3400560	And then I want to say there was another one they tried to do as a midnight movie for a short time,
3400560	3402400	because it was one of those things where it was like, if we're going to open...
3403440	3406320	Rocky Horror was the only one that people actually went to, by the way.
3406320	3407280	Because I remember for...
3408240	3410160	I remember one night...
3410160	3411760	Sorry, this has nothing to do with games.
3411760	3412960	I'm telling the story anyway.
3412960	3417520	I remember one night, we had such a big theme night going on.
3417520	3420800	We were running into theater two to fucking change
3421440	3426640	into one costume to another, because we were out of space in the back part area.
3426640	3427680	So it was like, you know what?
3427680	3430560	Once you run up the aisle, just go fucking change in the heavy metal theater.
3430560	3431280	No one's in there.
3433920	3436160	Anyway, all right.
3437200	3440160	I have an aside, by the way, about heavy metal.
3440800	3441760	Okay, why not?
3441760	3443200	I get tangents, you get tangents.
3443200	3443840	What's your aside?
3444560	3446320	So I used to play Rifts.
3446320	3449120	It was one of the first tabletop games I ever played.
3449120	3453120	And our campaign was to find the Lochnar.
3455280	3458480	And basically, my character was the only one that lived.
3459760	3461520	I played a true neutral character.
3461520	3467360	She had an anti-gravity trench coat and was playing Tetris
3467360	3469680	while the entire party got eaten by ants.
3469680	3472400	I love that.
3472400	3476800	And then she delivered the Lochnar to whoever had hired them to get it for a lot of money.
3476800	3478800	And then that was the last time I ever played Rifts.
3478800	3482240	Table games really truly only are limited by your imagination.
3482240	3483360	That's for sure.
3483360	3485040	By the way, speaking of the birdcage,
3485040	3488320	while Rocky Horror played in theater one, Heavy Metal would play in theater two,
3488320	3489520	and Austin Powers in theater three,
3489520	3491200	do you know what was going on in the parking lot?
3492640	3493440	Making out.
3493440	3493940	LARPing.
3494880	3495380	Well...
3497200	3498160	I LARPed.
3498160	3499680	Man, the birdcage being...
3499680	3502240	That was a fucking cultural icon here in the Sacramento area.
3502240	3504400	If any of our listeners are in Northern California,
3504960	3506480	and you're over the age of 30,
3506480	3509440	you understand all this reminiscing about the birdcage.
3509440	3511360	That was the place, I'll tell you.
3511360	3512160	All right.
3512160	3514000	Yeah, I just know about his second hand.
3514000	3517680	I mean, I was there when birdcage was torn down, but...
3517680	3521680	Yeah, you just missed it because they tore it down in, what, 2001?
3521680	3522880	No, that was the year you got here.
3523520	3524480	So I think you just missed it.
3524480	3527600	I was here in 99 because I remember that we watched
3527600	3531040	X 1999 and End of Evangelion back to back
3531040	3533760	when it turned to 2000 and was really depressed.
3535520	3536640	I was here.
3536640	3538640	The last Rocky Horror at birdcage was 2001.
3538640	3540400	So you were here, you just probably never got over there.
3541040	3542320	I was here, yeah.
3542320	3542820	All right.
3543280	3543780	Anyway...
3544320	3547840	Because Dan and I used to go to the game room, like, all the time.
3547840	3549280	Oh, that arcade was bomb.
3549280	3551040	Anyway, Bobby Blackwolf in chat says,
3551120	3551600	See?
3551600	3554800	Had I not mansplained, we wouldn't have had any of these tangents.
3554800	3556160	You're welcome, O.L. Army.
3557120	3559200	What about all the good things mansplaining did?
3560000	3562320	S.J. 100 Matt says,
3562320	3565760	We need to bring Travis Donovan in on this memory lane trip.
3565760	3566800	Absolutely.
3566800	3567520	Absolutely.
3567520	3569600	All right, let's move on to our next story.
3569600	3570640	Did you want to do this dark soccer?
3570640	3571760	You want me to do this?
3571760	3572640	You can do it.
3572640	3577200	Okay, then let's talk about the Epic Game Store and some of the...
3577920	3578880	I'm sorry, Loki.
3578880	3579680	Why don't you do this?
3579680	3580640	I'm sorry, I noticed it was you.
3580640	3581360	I thought I had this.
3582960	3583460	Nope.
3584080	3585520	So there's some...
3587360	3590240	I don't know if it's leaks or, like, rumors or whatever, but it's...
3590240	3595760	The database lists Final Fantasy 7 Remake and Alan Wake Remastered
3595760	3599280	as titles that are going to be possibly coming out.
3599280	3602560	So they're under, like, kind of code names right now.
3602560	3606560	But if you look at the database, it actually shows, like, the cloud save folder,
3606560	3608560	which then has their actual names.
3608560	3614320	So I like these because, you know, Final Fantasy 7 Remake, that's Pineapple QA.
3614320	3618640	And then we have Heron staging for Alan Wake Remastered.
3618640	3620240	So I guess these are coming.
3621200	3621760	Just when?
3622880	3625120	I am so here for an Alan Wake Remastered.
3625120	3626080	I hope it's true.
3626080	3628320	I hope they got to keep the licensed music.
3628320	3632320	That's my other big, like, request because it had an amazing soundtrack.
3632960	3637280	Like, I'm sorry, I screamed when Pose Haunted actually was in a video game.
3637280	3638720	I never thought I'd live to see the day.
3639600	3641680	But yeah, and that whole soundtrack was amazing.
3641680	3644560	So if they actually got to keep the licensed music and they're doing a remaster,
3644560	3645520	I'm so here for it.
3646080	3646720	Let's hope so.
3647680	3654480	Yeah, I'm curious to see what abominations we're going to get with Final Fantasy 7
3654480	3659040	Remastered coming to PC, and then the modding community hits it.
3659040	3659680	Oh boy!
3660240	3661760	That's going to be interesting!
3661760	3662720	Can't wait!
3662720	3663840	It's going to be a lot of fun.
3663840	3664340	All right.
3665300	3667700	Anyhow, let's move on and talk about...
3667700	3670020	Hey, let's talk about the things people are already making.
3670660	3675060	A game that encourages making your own games.
3675060	3677460	Game Builder Garage came out for the Nintendo Switch.
3677460	3679700	That was another one of those things I meant to get around to this week.
3679700	3682820	And, you know, just didn't get the time.
3682820	3687220	And we were kind of wondering, like, how long before people build copyright
3687220	3689460	questionable things in Game Builder Garage?
3690100	3691620	And it was kind of like, well, it maybe...
3691940	3696500	It seems like it might be too limited to do that kind of stuff.
3696500	3699060	Like it's not Dreams, you know, on the PS4.
3699060	3701780	Like Game Builder Garage is still a little limited in what you can do.
3701780	3704500	So we weren't sure if there would be a lot, but as it turns out,
3705220	3708820	no, people are able to make some pretty neat knockoffs in there.
3708820	3716420	So apparently some Twitter users actually made the 1996 O'Green of Time prototype.
3716420	3717540	That's amazing.
3717540	3722500	And a user named Zelda Boy on Twitter made the original SNES Mario Kart.
3723380	3725940	Apparently recreated that in Game Builder Garage.
3725940	3731460	Now it looks like I'm looking at the screenshot of it and it doesn't totally look right.
3731460	3736980	But still the idea that somebody kind of made it and it kind of works is pretty neat.
3736980	3742100	Anyway, if you want to look up this user on Twitter, their name is Zelda Boy,
3742100	3743860	but that's B-O-I and then one.
3744660	3748340	You can see they put the game ID there if you want to check out that game
3748340	3749860	and with all the controls there.
3749860	3751460	So I think that's pretty cool.
3751460	3755220	And yeah, the O'Green of Time prototype link doesn't exactly look right,
3755220	3759460	but still, I mean, the fact that people are going this far with it is pretty cool.
3760260	3763460	Yeah, I haven't played Game Builder Garage yet, but my son's still going through it.
3763460	3765940	He played through like several different tutorials.
3765940	3768820	So he's been having me play his games that he's been making with it.
3768820	3772980	So there's one that he did where it's like a two-player game where you have...
3772980	3775220	It's like tag, so you have to get away from the one person
3775220	3777860	and dodge like these balls that are falling down.
3777860	3782820	And then there was another one he did that was kind of like one of those labyrinth mazes
3782820	3785060	where you tilt the marble around.
3785060	3788980	So he uses the motion controls to control that one.
3788980	3789620	So that's cool.
3790420	3791140	He's enjoying it.
3791780	3792340	All right.
3792340	3793460	Yeah, I want to check that out.
3793460	3795300	We haven't put Pixel Poops 2 on it yet, so, you know.
3796340	3797700	By the way, one other...
3797700	3800340	There's an Intend Dogs prototype that somebody made as well.
3800420	3802180	Japanese user made that.
3802180	3803940	So that's pretty cool.
3803940	3806660	So anyway, I definitely have to check out the Game Builder Garage.
3806660	3808900	For nothing else, I just want to play other people's games.
3808900	3810820	People are very creative.
3810820	3812180	It's not a full-price game either.
3812180	3814580	I think it's $30 or $40.
3814580	3815860	Oh, that's even better.
3815860	3817860	Yeah, so it's definitely worth checking out.
3817860	3818580	Absolutely.
3818580	3819300	All right, moving on.
3819300	3819800	Loki.
3821220	3828580	All right, so Cyberpunk 2077 has been littered with bugs and problems.
3828580	3833860	And you may remember last year they had pulled it from the PlayStation Store because it was so broken.
3834420	3836420	Well, it's finally coming back.
3837140	3842820	So you can actually now check it out for the PlayStation 4 now.
3843460	3844820	I don't think they have a dedicated PlayStation...
3844820	3848340	Well, yeah, obviously they don't have a dedicated PlayStation 5 or Series X version yet.
3848340	3851380	But it's coming.
3852020	3853940	So the wait...
3853940	3857380	I don't even know what the timeline was because I know that was supposed to be March originally.
3857380	3858340	And then they pushed it back.
3858340	3864020	I don't know if that's still August or something, but I haven't played it in a while.
3864020	3870020	It's been probably six months since I played that game because I've been just waiting for it to be fully patched.
3870020	3871300	Yeah, I don't blame you.
3872340	3875700	But that's great that they can actually get the sales from PlayStation now.
3875700	3881380	Although, you know, based on other stories, it doesn't sound like the game got hurt as bad as we thought it would.
3881380	3883300	I mean, yes, they had to do some refunds.
3883300	3884260	They did quite a few of those.
3884260	3888900	But it sounded to me like the game was still, for all intents and purposes, successful.
3891060	3896500	Despite all these, you know, launch horror stories and the fact that I got pulled from the PlayStation shop.
3896500	3898820	And now that's just, you know, more money for them to bring in.
3898820	3901460	They probably won't put this game on sale for quite some time.
3901460	3906660	I would imagine this holiday will start to see some sales on this game, which is about the time I'll start to look at it.
3907380	3912820	But, you know, because like Loki's kind of also saying there, when it gets the patches and all that stuff, I might be more into it.
3912820	3914980	It's going to be a great game once it gets the patches.
3914980	3919620	It's just, you know, it had a lot of promise, like with the concept for it.
3919620	3921780	But they just kind of cut a lot of corners.
3921780	3936980	So if they're able to kind of pull, I mean, it's hard to say if they pull a no man's sky and just completely bring, you know, if they at least like kind of meet us a little bit halfway there or something, you know, with like fixing, especially like the police AI, which I know was on the list of things to do.
3936980	3951700	So it's not so cheap, or if like I'm starting, you know, to get my crime level up or whatever, I don't have police officers teleporting right behind you, I'm sitting on the ledge of a building, you know, like ridiculous stuff like that, like, then that would be fine.
3953700	3955220	I don't know, I'll go back to it eventually.
3955220	3957140	But it was it was a pretty good game.
3957140	3958980	It's just a pretty buggy game.
3958980	3961300	Some more comments on Cyberpunk in our chat room.
3961940	3965860	Quest Buster says the biggest damage was to CD Projekt's reputation.
3965860	3968660	But from their fiscal reports, they made bank on the game.
3968660	3972500	And Bobby Blackwell says CP 2077 was still a financial success.
3972500	3981460	And I think it really does go a long way to underscore the fact that, you know, internet rage on Twitter, Facebook and all that stuff.
3981460	3983140	It doesn't mean shit.
3984500	3987540	What really matters is if you buy the game or not.
3987540	3996020	And if you give the money or not, it really matters what's coming out of your wallet or staying in your wallet at the end of the day, if you're complaining about it on Twitter and then buy the game anyway.
3996020	3997060	Congrats, you did nothing.
3997700	4005940	So I mean, you know, and sometimes I mean, with the Cyberpunk stuff, I that's one of those ones where I kind of understand why people were pissed off with that.
4005940	4011460	But there's other things where I'm always like, you know, why are people they're going to buy the game anyway?
4011460	4015940	Why are people complaining about if they show a Breath of the Wild 2 trailer at E3 or not?
4015940	4016340	Shut up.
4016340	4017620	You're going to buy the game anyway.
4017620	4018580	And, you know, tea.
4021140	4023540	All right, let's move on.
4024820	4042820	Let's talk about the Xbox Series X and S, because, you know, they've talked about how the X and S titles are, you know, they still want to support the Xbox One, even though they want to make games that are really only technically possible on the Xbox X and S.
4042820	4044420	So what happens to Xbox One?
4044420	4057300	And I remember suggesting on a prior episode, and I'm sure I'm not the only one to do this, that, well, if Microsoft's getting into this cloud thing, then why would the Xbox One at some point not just become the way you play games on the cloud?
4057300	4058180	Well, guess what?
4058740	4059380	Guess what?
4060020	4062980	It looks like that is actually the direction that Microsoft is going.
4063940	4081780	Will Tuttle from Microsoft kind of confirmed in a Xbox news post at news.xbox.com that Xbox One owners will get to play many, so they don't want to commit to all, but many Xbox Series X and S titles through cloud gaming.
4081780	4086900	We don't know what the details look like yet, but I guess in the future we'll know more about how this works.
4086900	4092100	And we kind of, you know, we have an idea through some of these test programs and stuff what that might look like.
4092100	4100820	You know, and again, this, I, you know, even though it's been speculation, they've kind of hinted this is where it's been going before.
4100820	4104820	Phil Spencer had mentioned in an interview that he did with Kotaku in October.
4104820	4111300	Game streaming could help bridge generations and let Xbox One users play the latest titles.
4111300	4115780	My big shock is that they wouldn't put a cloud gaming player on Xbox 360.
4116500	4116980	Why not?
4117700	4121620	Maybe, maybe it isn't, I don't, how could, how can...
4121620	4122740	Maybe it can't handle that.
4122740	4125220	Maybe it really can't, or maybe the, are the controllers too different?
4125220	4125460	Maybe?
4125460	4131300	I don't know, but I, I would just, I would just be surprised they wouldn't even put a cloud gaming player on the Xbox 360.
4131300	4132580	They might though.
4132580	4134260	I don't rule it out.
4135460	4142660	But maybe they're also thinking there's not quite the, you know, Xbox 360s are starting to kind of like stop working and stuff like that.
4142660	4144900	So maybe they don't think they'd get the game for the buck.
4145460	4154900	And I, I don't think that like, because that's a couple generations back, like I get it that, you know, they probably still want you to at least upgrade.
4154900	4162660	And my concern I think with the Xbox 360 would be storage because the hard drives on those weren't very large.
4162660	4163060	True.
4163060	4168500	And so to be able to, you know, store or cache, you know, I guess with game streaming it's not a big deal.
4168500	4176100	But like, I think maybe they just want you to upgrade to the, at least the Xbox One to be able to run that stuff.
4176100	4179620	Because maybe those processors are just really old and maybe storage is an issue with those.
4179620	4184420	But they probably also just want to sell at least some of those consoles.
4184420	4186020	At the very least, like, you know, the last gen.
4186020	4193140	And I mean, even now, I don't know what like an original Xbox One goes for, but like, I can't imagine it's super expensive at this point.
4193140	4194020	Not at this point.
4194020	4196180	I want to get to this comment in chat.
4196180	4199300	Ninja The Monkey in chat says, well, look at the Game Pass.
4199300	4203700	Most of the newer editions are for X and S, but you can still play it on the One.
4203700	4204180	Yes.
4204180	4211220	And Microsoft kind of promised that in the beginning is that we're going to still be developing titles that are playable on both.
4211220	4213300	Like Halo Infinite is playable on both.
4213300	4215300	And this has nothing to do with cloud gaming.
4215300	4221300	This is just the whole, like, you know, a modern PC will play it super well at these settings.
4221300	4224900	But on an older PC, it'll look less great, right?
4224900	4226660	The frame rate might not be quite as smooth.
4226660	4229940	You might have the same draw distance and all that stuff, but you'll still be able to play the game.
4230500	4233860	Honestly, same deal with PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4, right?
4233860	4236020	Like they announced Horizon Forbidden West.
4236020	4238020	It's going to be on PlayStation 5, but guess what?
4238020	4239540	They're also going to put it on PlayStation 4.
4240900	4252340	But I think what we're looking ahead to is that Microsoft may not want to keep developing that way through the entire lifespan of the series X and S.
4252340	4262020	There's going to come a point where this game and this vision that we have, this Forza Motorsport 8, I think is the game that's breaking it, to be perfectly frank.
4263060	4265220	This game won't play on the One.
4265220	4267140	It is too powerful.
4267140	4269380	It needs a series X and S.
4269380	4277300	And I, you know, I say that very specifically because they were demoing Forza Motorsport in the early days of the Xbox Series X.
4277300	4279060	We're getting Horizon instead.
4279060	4282260	Motorsport has mysteriously disappeared and been delayed.
4282260	4286180	And I think it's because that is the game they cannot get working on the Xbox One.
4286180	4291380	And so they have decided, fuck it, we're going to delay it until we no longer need to put it out on the Xbox One.
4291380	4301380	And our cloud gaming system is in place that will now allow you to do Forza Motorsport 8 or whatever it is on the Xbox One through the magic of cloud gaming.
4301380	4303380	So that's that's my guess.
4304340	4307700	Anyway, Bobby Blackwolf also, oh, this is OK.
4307700	4310260	Now, this is a really good theory about the 360.
4310260	4317300	The Xbox 360's Ethernet port is only a well, he actually corrects it and says, OK, it is a 100 megabyte port.
4317300	4319940	I think that it's not a gigabit port.
4319940	4323060	That's why it has a different color in my router.
4323060	4325460	OK, that that makes no sense.
4325460	4326260	Gigabit port.
4326260	4329540	Yeah, that makes sense then that it's just not fast enough.
4329540	4331620	The parts inside to handle cloud stuff.
4331620	4332020	All right.
4332020	4332420	I got you.
4332420	4332900	I got you.
4333700	4336500	Yeah, it can work for Netflix, but maybe not X cloud.
4336500	4336980	I get it.
4336980	4337620	I get it.
4337620	4337940	All right.
4337940	4338660	Anyway, good.
4339300	4339780	All right.
4339780	4340500	Well, OK.
4340500	4342820	I think we've talked about the cloud.
4342820	4346020	I think it's time to go back and talk about something a little retro.
4358820	4363220	Time to travel back to a simpler time or I'll dive into the vault.
4363220	4365940	And pull out a classic and tell you about it.
4365940	4368580	It's time for the classic game of the week.
4370740	4372580	And what did you pick this week, Dark Sakura?
4373540	4377460	I picked a kind of fan game.
4379140	4381380	It was a freeware role playing game.
4382500	4389460	And it was presented as an official sequel to Barkley Shut Up and Jam and Space Jam.
4390260	4392980	And it's called Barkley Shut Up and Jam Gaiden.
4393220	4395300	And it's weird.
4396980	4403220	If I was doing a weird home game of the month, this one would be on it.
4403220	4405620	We have this in my background not too long ago.
4406900	4407220	Yeah.
4409620	4417140	So anyway, you basically are playing as Charles Barkley and a few secondary characters.
4419380	4421860	It's it's interesting.
4421860	4431620	So basically, it has a play system called, I guess it would be pronounced BABY,
4431620	4433140	but it's B-A-B-B-Y.
4433140	4441220	BABY maybe system that the battle system was influenced by a lot of the JRPGs.
4441220	4447380	So the enemies will appear on the game field and run at your player.
4447380	4450980	And they will attack you if you move into their line of sight.
4451060	4454820	And then you have a battle and you have attacks and skills.
4454820	4461780	And basically, you also do have timed button presses like in the Mario RPG series.
4462980	4464820	And some are accuracy based.
4464820	4466740	So, I mean, it's your general game.
4467620	4469700	Apart from that weirdness.
4471300	4479300	So you're playing in 2041, 12 years prior to the main part of the game
4479300	4483060	in this post cyber-apocalyptic Neo New York.
4484580	4488660	Where Charles Barkley does a chaos dunk at a baseball game
4488660	4491860	and inadvertently kills with the people who are there.
4491860	4496260	So basketball gets outlawed and basketball players are hunted down and killed.
4497860	4501380	So basically, that's the beginning premise.
4502580	4507620	Someone else does another chaos dunk later and Charles Barkley is blamed for it.
4507620	4513220	And so there is a hunt by the b-ball removal department led by Michael Jordan.
4514340	4522020	And I'm going to leave it there because it apparently goes really, really weird.
4523220	4528180	So like, I mean, it's got a very involved story,
4528180	4535700	but the whole thing is that it came apart as a sort of joke based on
4535700	4539460	an awkward phrase on Michael Jordan's Wikipedia page.
4540660	4543780	So it was developed by Tales of Games Studios.
4545540	4548980	They were members from Amateur Game Development Forum.
4549620	4552260	And that phrase was about whether,
4552980	4557300	it was about the fan debate over whether or not Space Jam was canon
4557300	4561060	without specifying if it was talking about the Looney Tunes series
4561060	4563140	or Michael Jordan's life in general.
4563780	4571060	So some of the members, and I'll give the names, was Chef Boyardee, Bort, Jeezy.
4571060	4574660	When I hear Bort, all I think is the Blort, which is what I call the blight.
4575780	4581460	And QuackGyver all had some work in developing the game.
4581460	4584180	And there were a few other minor contributions.
4584900	4591220	And it was first developed in RPG Maker 2003 and ported to Game Maker 6.1.
4591460	4595860	It was planned to be released for both, but eventually only came out
4595860	4599220	through Game Maker 6.1 because of power and flexibility.
4600100	4602340	And it also was,
4606980	4612340	at the 2014 Games Done Quick, the guys behind it said they never played
4612340	4614580	the original Shut Up and Jam.
4614580	4616100	Sorry, I can't make words today.
4616180	4620180	But they said that the thought of that RPG would make them laugh,
4620180	4621060	and that's why they did it.
4622020	4627540	So, Tales of Games in 2012 announced a sequel called
4627540	4632180	The Magical Realms of Ternanog Escape from Necron 7,
4632180	4635220	Revenge of Cocolon, the official game of the movie,
4635220	4637860	Chapter 2 of the Hoops Barclay Saga.
4637860	4638980	That's the full name.
4639860	4642260	Had crowdfunding on Kickstarter to start it.
4642500	4656500	It ended, the Kickstarter ended on December 28th and raised $120,335.
4659620	4664740	And they were doing everything from scratch to avoid copyright issues.
4666420	4669220	But the majority of the developers left the project,
4670180	4674580	and that development is going slowly because only two people are behind it right now,
4674580	4676740	and there's some very poor management going on.
4677300	4679140	So we'll see if it actually happens.
4680340	4685700	But yeah, as far as release dates, this came out January 22nd, 2008,
4685700	4688900	which means it's permitted.
4690180	4694580	And it was released on Windows and Mac OS X.
4694580	4698500	And that's it.
4699700	4700180	All right.
4700900	4702100	It's weird, isn't it?
4702100	4704340	It is very weird, that is for sure.
4706340	4708420	Yeah, I'm reading some of the comments.
4708420	4711140	I just think it's funny that he's talking to Larry Bird in there,
4711140	4712420	who's wearing a fedora.
4712420	4712920	Oh, yeah.
4714740	4716260	I'm reading some of the comments in chat.
4716260	4719300	I guess this is actually a very timely sort of pick.
4719300	4721860	I didn't realize this because, well, for what they're all saying,
4721860	4723620	like, this game's 10 years old, what?
4723700	4727220	But apparently, and I know this, Questbuster says
4727220	4732900	they even had a widely successful Kickstarter for a sequel that never materialized.
4732900	4737060	And Bobby says they literally canceled it two weeks ago and released all the code.
4737060	4738500	Is that not what I just said?
4738500	4741140	Oh, it's not AFK for just a moment.
4741140	4741640	I'm sorry.
4742420	4742820	Okay.
4742820	4745940	I said that in talking about the game.
4745940	4746180	Got it.
4746180	4746580	My bad.
4746580	4750820	But I didn't know it was canceled, so thanks to Bobby.
4750820	4751460	Okay.
4751460	4752020	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
4752020	4752660	Okay.
4752660	4757060	So and then there's a whole little update on the particular itch.io there.
4757060	4758340	So, yeah.
4758340	4764180	I would advise the chat not to make a comment about the history of the game
4764180	4765540	until I'm done with my segment.
4766820	4767320	Just saying.
4768020	4768520	All right.
4769860	4770660	What is this?
4770660	4771540	I'm trying to see what is this?
4771540	4773300	Sadly, no one is streaming this.
4773300	4776820	I don't know if that's the discussion about the game or what that is.
4776820	4777460	So, okay.
4778180	4779620	But yeah, there it is.
4779620	4780580	Classic game of the week.
4780580	4783300	A very unique pick because I just...
4783300	4786420	It looks good though for design.
4786420	4786980	No, for sure.
4786980	4790340	For something that's kind of like indie made or whatever.
4790340	4793300	It definitely looks polished.
4793300	4796420	I think is a good way to put it for something that's a homegrown
4796420	4797780	and RPG maker type of thing.
4798420	4800660	And obviously it's a hilarious concept, that's for sure.
4801220	4802500	So, all right.
4803300	4806900	Let's move on and get to some rapid fire news.
4806900	4809540	We're going to travel around the industry quickly
4809540	4811780	and check out some other quick headlines.
4811780	4814420	And let's get to Loki starting off with you.
4815220	4817620	Yeah, so the Xbox design lab is back.
4817620	4822020	So you may remember they had something similar back with the Xbox One
4822020	4824340	and I think even Xbox 360 controllers.
4825300	4826900	Maybe it's just Xbox One controllers.
4826900	4831540	But where you basically can go onto this design lab, customize colors,
4831540	4834100	add your gamertag, all that stuff.
4834100	4838980	And they'll actually ship you a completed controller in that color scheme.
4840100	4844580	So that was originally something that was available for, I think, the Xbox One controllers.
4844580	4849460	And then obviously the Xbox Series X came out and Series S
4849460	4851860	and the controllers were slightly different.
4851860	4856580	So they actually had stopped accepting the custom controllers
4856580	4859860	for about eight months or so back in October.
4860580	4861780	But it's back now.
4861780	4864500	So now you can get your own Xbox Series X controller
4864500	4867940	in gaudy colors if you want, which is cool.
4868260	4872980	And those cost $70 with free shipping or $10 extra
4872980	4875060	if you want to engrave your gamertag on there.
4876180	4883300	And then GTA Online is going to be shut down on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 on December 16th.
4883300	4885780	Honestly, I'm surprised it hasn't already.
4885780	4891700	But in case you're still playing it on the Xbox 360 and PS3, it's going to be shut down.
4893060	4895940	I thought that they stopped getting updates on those consoles.
4896500	4899620	So, yeah, once again, very surprised that that's still a thing.
4899620	4905460	But wow, so many generations in with just one Grand Theft Auto game.
4905460	4906660	I am very disappointed.
4908020	4911700	Yeah, I keep forgetting that that was actually all the way back to PlayStation 3.
4911700	4912740	That's so wild.
4912740	4914980	It's going to probably be 10 years old here.
4914980	4918660	Well, it came out in 2010.
4918660	4919300	No, not 10.
4919860	4920980	It was a while ago.
4920980	4925460	I don't think it's been 10 years yet, but it's been a while.
4925540	4929140	So I'm not surprised.
4929140	4933940	Before we get to Jamie's stories, the Xbox thing, can I go back there real quick?
4933940	4937220	Because I think it's great that we can make the custom controllers,
4937220	4940100	but I'm still irritated we can't get that Pride controller.
4940100	4942500	Why can't I make that in the custom shop?
4942500	4944260	Because I like their approach to it.
4944260	4946900	They didn't just put one rainbow thing.
4946900	4950740	They kind of did all this abstract, more type of style to it.
4950740	4951300	I love it.
4951300	4953300	And I wish I could get that as a controller.
4953300	4955220	But whatever.
4955220	4959940	It was for influencers only, and I don't count, so whatever.
4959940	4961620	Anyway, let's move on.
4961620	4962980	DarkSakura for Rapid Fire News.
4962980	4963620	What do you have for us?
4964500	4972100	Amazon has a gaming service called Luna that has, I guess, a beta out for it right now.
4973140	4980020	That's no invite access on Prime Day, which is June 21st and 22nd.
4980020	4983220	Prime subscribers can start a seven-day trial
4983220	4988100	and get discounts on the Luna controller and Fire TV bundle.
4988660	4993860	It costs $5.99 a month and includes some really new games.
4995940	5006500	The dedicated controller is discounted from $249 from the list price for $70 for Prime members.
5007060	5008820	The controller is $70?
5011140	5011640	Yeah.
5012980	5016180	And I'm not going to use it because I like Stadia.
5017940	5022340	Yeah, I think I've learned my lesson with buying controllers for streaming systems.
5025540	5028900	Also, Bayonetta 3 had a teaser.
5028900	5029620	It exists.
5031300	5035780	It is progressing well according to the developers.
5035860	5038660	So it will be out eventually.
5042020	5042980	Or so they claim.
5044340	5045700	I'll believe it when I see it.
5046980	5047700	I hope so.
5047700	5051540	I guess, man, the pandemic must really be, you know, because there's that part of me
5051540	5054660	that just wants to instinctively go, what's taking them so damn long?
5054660	5057220	But then I'm like, oh, yeah, COVID happens.
5057220	5058340	It's still happening, really.
5058980	5063860	And it's no joke, the type of influence that's had on things.
5064420	5065700	So, yeah.
5066580	5071060	But and, you know, Bayonetta, one of the best games of the year when it released.
5071060	5073540	Bayonetta 2, one of the best games of the year when it released.
5073540	5077460	So Bayonetta 3, like, the expectations are pretty high.
5077460	5081780	So I guess it's going to take a little while for a cake like that to really sit in the
5081780	5083860	oven and reach its full potential.
5083860	5084500	That's for sure.
5085060	5085560	Okay.
5085940	5090100	Anyway, let's talk about some games we're going to be playing a little sooner than Bayonetta
5090100	5093220	3 as we get into some release dates.
5093300	5094980	Loki, let's start with you in the US.

5229300	5229780	That is...
5229780	5230340	That looks like...
5230340	5236820	Oh, it looks like a tactical game involving like nautical battle and things like that.
5236820	5239140	Like air to sea, sea to air type of stuff.
5239140	5240420	So interesting.

5342420	5342980	All right.
5342980	5343540	Let's move on.
5343540	5345140	We have a few more headlines for you guys.
5345140	5348340	Before we get to some of your feedback via Discord.
5348340	5349140	The mail...
5349140	5350420	I don't know if we have emails this week.
5350420	5350920	We'll find out.
5351540	5355540	And of course our chat over at twitch.tv slash vog network.
5355540	5357620	But first, Loki.
5358180	5360500	This is the headline of all headlines, right?
5360500	5361380	It is.
5361380	5362500	I mean, it's finally out.
5362500	5363860	The Atari VCS.
5363860	5364580	You can buy it.
5364580	5366260	I've been waiting for so long.
5367380	5371220	It's $300 or $400 if you want it like in Walnut
5371220	5374180	with the kind of like retro controller in there as well.
5375060	5377620	Uh, yeah.
5377620	5378420	Or no, I'm sorry.
5378420	5381540	With the the Xbox gamepad type thing that's in there.
5381540	5385620	Um, what's it do?
5386820	5387780	It's a PC.
5387780	5388980	It's a Ryzen PC.
5388980	5390820	Or at least it has a Ryzen chip in it.
5391380	5392260	What can you run on it?
5392900	5393400	No idea.
5394900	5395400	It...
5397460	5398100	I don't want it.
5398740	5402500	I wonder, I wonder if they got it when it comes down to like $50.
5402500	5403860	But like, I'm not buying that.
5403860	5407140	The last headline I saw on this was that Atari VCS
5407140	5409380	was doing like a partnership with Antstream,
5409380	5411700	the classic game streaming service,
5411700	5414900	to have Atari stuff that was like only playable on VCS.
5414900	5417140	Like the VCS is going to have its own version of Antstream
5417700	5422100	because they were slowly adding some Atari titles to Antstream.
5422100	5424500	But certainly there's a lot more that they didn't put on there.
5425700	5427940	I wonder if that actually happened or not.
5427940	5428820	Oh, it did.
5428820	5429700	Okay, it did.
5429700	5430180	It did.
5430180	5432020	But it also has 100 games bundled with it.
5432020	5433540	So 100 Atari games.
5433700	5434660	Retro Atari games.
5435700	5437140	I'm sure that's worth $300.
5438260	5441620	I don't know if I was gonna spend $400 on something like that.
5441620	5444420	I would get a 1UP cabinet, to be honest.
5444420	5448420	But it's a hard sell.
5449780	5450260	I don't know.
5452580	5453860	At least it looks nice.
5453860	5455060	I mean, if it's a decent...
5455060	5455700	If it can like...
5456580	5460260	If I only wanted like something to like hack apart to like play retro games,
5460260	5461940	I mean, it's a cool looking console.
5461940	5464660	But not at that price.
5466820	5470580	Yeah, I just don't know what I would really need this for.
5470580	5474340	I mean, I guess, yeah, it's like the tiny little computer of itself.
5474340	5475380	But I don't know.
5475380	5477860	I'm not sure the place it has.
5478900	5480500	But we'll see how it does.
5480500	5482340	Maybe there's other people that'll have a place for it.
5482340	5482820	Who knows?
5483380	5483860	Who knows?
5484500	5484900	All right.
5485540	5488260	Podculture says Ryzen Mobile CPU, isn't it?
5489300	5489700	All right.
5490020	5497540	All right, moving on to a story about Squeenix and the release of Outriders.
5497540	5499780	This was a game that I checked out on Game Pass.
5499780	5500260	Just...
5500260	5503060	I don't know if I would have normally bought this kind of game,
5503060	5506500	but because it was on Game Pass, I checked it out and I did enjoy it enough.
5506500	5508020	One of these days, I need to go back to it.
5508740	5514580	And maybe there's a lot of people like me out there, because during a recent investors meeting,
5514580	5519780	President and Representative Director Yosuke Matsuda said that despite whatever bugs were
5519780	5523940	there at launch, Outriders has gotten off to a good start as a new IP.
5524900	5531300	Going on to say that they are pleasantly surprised at the digital sales that the title has been
5531300	5532260	getting has been high.
5532260	5535540	The number of active users has beaten expectations.
5536660	5540580	They also say the decision to make the game available through Game Pass as soon as the
5540580	5544980	title launch has worked in its favor of building an install base.
5545620	5548580	Now, this could mean some...
5548580	5552340	Square Enix kind of seeing that this could mean some interesting things for the Xbox
5552340	5554180	Game Pass model going forward.
5554180	5558740	I'm not saying we're in suddenly see something like Final Fantasy 16, obviously, because
5558740	5560660	that's going to be a PlayStation exclusive out the gate.
5560660	5564340	But I'm just saying it is interesting now, and I'm sure other companies are going to
5564340	5568260	kind of see that where it's like, oh, the benefits of getting a huge install base out
5568260	5570100	the gate may be worth it.
5570580	5573940	I bet at some point they delist Outriders from Game Pass.
5573940	5576020	And it's like, hey, you want to keep playing?
5576020	5579460	Now you got to pony up the money, but we'll see, I guess.
5581060	5588580	So anyway, in mid-May, Outriders had 3.5 million players in the first month of release.
5589380	5593540	And then apparently there was average play times of over 30 hours.
5593540	5594420	That's still pretty good.
5595460	5599860	If you are not on Game Pass and you want to check the game out, there is still a demo
5599860	5602100	that is available on all platforms.
5602100	5603460	So you can check that out.
5604260	5604760	Pretty cool.
5605620	5606120	All right.
5607220	5607620	Let's see.
5607620	5609380	Going to some comments from our chat.
5609380	5613460	Questbuster in chat says the only problem is Outriders end game, which needs some work.
5614340	5616820	I've heard that complaint elsewhere as well.
5616820	5621060	And yeah, I wonder if there isn't going to be an expansion.
5621620	5622020	You know what?
5622020	5622820	I bet that's it.
5622820	5626900	I bet they don't pull the game from Game Pass, but they release an expansion.
5626900	5629860	And then that's where they're really going to make some money from the install base.
5629860	5633300	And then an expansion can kind of tweak end game things, right?
5633300	5635620	Like that's what we saw happen with Diablo 3.
5635620	5639460	Diablo 3 got a way better end game because of an expansion.
5639460	5642980	And so I could see that maybe be in their solution to the problem.
5642980	5644260	We'll see what happens with that.
5644980	5649060	Anyway, sj100matt says I finished the main game, but I haven't touched the post-game
5649060	5650020	excursions at all.
5651060	5652980	I guess again, that speaks to the end game.
5652980	5657460	I just really liked the blend of a little bit of Borderlands with Gears of War.
5657460	5660500	And Questbuster is saying I'd love an expansion for Outriders.
5660500	5664820	So I kind of see that could be the secret there.
5664820	5665700	So we'll see.
5665700	5666340	We'll see.
5666340	5667460	Anyhow, Loki.
5670820	5671860	You're muted, Justino.
5672820	5673140	Sorry.
5673780	5678740	So let's talk about some limited run games that are immediate and some physical versions of those.
5679380	5682100	So they have their own E3 presentation as well.
5683060	5686100	Some of our notable things, like we actually have a Turbo Duo game.
5686100	5691860	So Castlevania Rondo Blood is getting a new special edition physical release for the Turbo
5691860	5692580	Duo.
5692580	5695380	And then we have Castlevania Requiem for PlayStation 4.
5697540	5699220	Axiom Verge 2.
5699220	5704260	We've got River City Girls, Girls 2, and River City Girls 0.
5705300	5707140	Shantae 1 through 5.
5707140	5710900	Skatebird, which really should be called Skateburb, but you know.
5711540	5715540	Zombies Ate My Neighbors and Ghoul Patrol is getting a physical version on Switch.
5716580	5719300	Superhot also getting a version on Switch as well.
5720180	5722820	And yeah, lots of titles.
5722820	5728420	There was, I think, a total of like, you know, like 15 or 20 titles, 25 new titles that are
5728420	5729060	in there.
5729060	5732980	So pretty amazing that they're still kind of pushing all of the physical release stuff
5732980	5735460	and also like, you know, the Turbo Duo version.
5735460	5736420	That's kind of neat.
5736420	5742340	Yeah, it's so fascinating what that company has been doing for like retro game collections,
5742340	5746420	like just putting out the actual, you know, turbo graphics card and things like that.
5746420	5748260	It's just, it's fascinating to me.
5748260	5749140	I love it, though.
5749140	5749540	I love it.
5749540	5755700	I think that, I think they sort of, I think Limited Run kind of gets the secret sauce
5755700	5760660	about, you know, as the industry is moving to things like Game Pass and digital stuff,
5760660	5764260	you know, are physical games going to have a place moving forward?
5764260	5770100	And Limited Run definitely sees like, oh, we definitely see where like the, you know,
5770100	5772260	the pendulum swinging really hard the other way.
5772260	5774900	It's not just a physical release, but collectibles.
5774900	5778500	You know, that sort of physical release is really where there's, you know, stuff to be
5778500	5779060	made still.
5779060	5781460	And I think they're doing a very good job of that, to be honest.
5782180	5784340	SHO 100 Matt kind of makes the comparison.
5784340	5787380	Limited Run Games is the arcade one up of consoles.
5787380	5789620	And I get that comparison, I do.
5790340	5793700	Mike Deft in chat says Limited Run should drop the limited, though.
5795060	5796580	Then they just be run.
5797300	5798660	They could be loading ready run.
5799540	5805060	I think that's not necessarily the limited, you know, scope of titles, but, you know,
5805060	5806420	they're limited releases.
5806420	5810820	I don't think that they're necessarily publishing, you know, hundreds of thousands of copies
5810820	5811460	of these.
5811460	5811960	Mm hmm.
5812660	5816500	And OrangeRite points out the great thing about the Turbo Duo release is that it's 100%
5816500	5816820	official.
5816820	5819460	It will have the Turbo Graphics 16 branding on it.
5819460	5822260	It helps that the game and the console are owned by the same company now.
5822260	5823300	Yeah, that's true.
5823380	5826900	And don't forget, they had that Turbo Mini not that long ago that was pretty damn well
5826900	5827860	received, actually.
5827860	5830020	So I enjoyed mine, that's for sure.
5830020	5830520	So.
5831220	5831860	All right.
5831860	5834980	Anyway, one more story for you guys tonight.
5835940	5838340	And I love it because it's about a toaster.
5839140	5840020	That's right.
5840020	5844740	There is an official Destiny toaster on the way out, as if an Xbox fridge.
5844740	5845220	Wasn't it?
5845220	5846980	Why not, Loki?
5846980	5847860	Why not?
5847860	5848180	We did.
5848180	5850980	Did I not just talk about video game collectibles?
5850980	5852180	That's where things are going.
5852180	5854660	It is your destiny to make some toast.
5856260	5857540	Every day for me.
5857540	5863140	Anyway, so yes, you will now soon be able to get a Destiny toaster.
5863140	5865300	It is going to cost you $85.
5865300	5868260	That's more expensive than a Hello Kitty toaster when they had them at Target.
5868260	5869140	Just pointing that out.
5869140	5873380	You can preorder the toaster from the Bungie store and it will ship at some point between
5873380	5876260	December and January 2022.
5876260	5877860	What about my holiday gift?
5878980	5880100	Well, there went that.
5880100	5881220	All right, whatever.
5881220	5887220	Anyway, you also get the Burnt Edges emblem in Destiny 2.
5887220	5892660	So if the toaster wasn't enough, you get a little in-game thing, the Burnt Edges emblem,
5892660	5893860	which is really fucking funny.
5893860	5897540	Now, Loki, here's the part to be less cynical about, the cool part.
5897540	5898980	It is part of a charity event.
5898980	5903700	So 10% of the purchase price goes to St. Jude Children's Research Hospital.
5903700	5905140	So, all right, we have that.
5905140	5906340	10%?
5906340	5907540	Can they do a little bit more?
5907540	5908580	How about 30%?
5909380	5909940	All right, anyway.
5910340	5910840	Exactly.
5912580	5916100	This is not the first fundraiser that Bungie and Destiny has done.
5916100	5920740	The Destiny community raised over $800,000 for St. Jude back in June.
5921540	5931460	So basically, Bungie offered will make a toaster if you hit the target of $777,777.7 all across
5931460	5931780	the board.
5931780	5936820	If you hit seven, seven, seven, seven, seven, which why they didn't do seven sevens and
5936820	5939140	they did eight sevens, I'm not going to understand, but that's all right.
5939140	5941060	They raised a lot of good money, so that's good.
5941060	5945700	And Bungie is making good on their promise, I guess, even if it's a little bit weird.
5946820	5950500	Anyone in chat going to be purchasing the Destiny thing?
5951220	5952020	No one special.
5952020	5953300	77 in chat says what?
5953300	5957140	No Destiny toilet paper, Destiny doll, Destiny flamethrower, et cetera.
5957140	5957860	What do you think this is?
5957860	5958980	Spaceballs?
5958980	5960660	What do you think?
5960660	5962740	It does sound like Spaceballs.
5962740	5964020	It does sound like Spaceballs.
5964020	5968180	And actually, I think there is other Destiny merchandise out there.
5968180	5970020	You joke about Destiny doll.
5970980	5972500	They've got Funko Pops.
5972500	5973620	I guarantee it.
5973620	5974580	Yeah, exactly.
5975300	5976580	Destiny, the lunchbox.
5976580	5977220	It's destiny.
5977220	5978660	The fruit or was it yogurt?
5979700	5980820	Uh, that's just you.
5980820	5981140	One hundred.
5981140	5982340	Matt makes a good point, though.
5982340	5986100	You know what Destiny doesn't have is a fanny pack like VOG.
5986100	5986740	That's right.
5986740	5992420	Thank you for that plug once again for our updated shop over at vognetwork.com slash shop.
5992420	5993540	That's right, Destiny.
5993540	5994660	You don't get a fanny pack.
5995540	5996180	I love it.
5996180	5996580	All right.
5997460	5999940	Mike Depp says there's a Destiny cookbook.
5999940	6000420	Really?
6002340	6003620	I did not know that was a thing.
6005220	6005860	All right.
6005860	6012020	It is time to go to the listener roundtable where I believe Dark Sakura indicated we have
6012020	6013220	an empty mailbag this week.
6013220	6016580	So she's going to taunt us with churros instead on her webcam.
6017300	6018980	Husband brought me dinner.
6018980	6023460	But if you would like to, where do you get dinner that comes with churros?
6023460	6023860	Hold up.
6025060	6026180	Del Taco.
6026260	6027380	They have churros?
6027380	6027880	Really?
6028740	6034020	I usually try not to get dessert at fast food because I already got fast food, but shit,
6034020	6035060	I might have to break it for that.
6035060	6035700	I love churros.
6035700	6039060	Anyway, I need it.
6039060	6039860	It was a need.
6039860	6041380	I understand.
6041380	6042180	I understand.
6042180	6047620	We all there's been days where it's like, I need what are like other favorite dessert.
6047620	6048500	Oh, Cheesecake Factory.
6048500	6049620	Frozen custard.
6050580	6052260	Oh, see, I don't really get that as much.
6052420	6053540	I eat frozen yogurt.
6053540	6057780	So we had a Rita's nearby that sells frozen custard and it was delicious.
6057780	6059780	And then they closed their store.
6060660	6063460	Because that's what happens when I find something I like.
6063460	6066100	We stop selling it or close it down.
6066100	6067700	It's like, oh, wait, Loki likes it.
6067700	6069540	Quick, shut the doors.
6069540	6072580	Isn't that fried chicken place you like that used to be near the studio?
6072580	6074260	Like, didn't that come back somewhere?
6074260	6074820	It is coming.
6074820	6076260	It came back in a bunch of places.
6076260	6077940	So I did order a bunch of that the other day.
6077940	6081940	And I also ordered a bunch of the actual powder that they put on it from them because you
6081940	6082660	can buy that.
6082660	6087060	And then I've been sprinkling that on other chicken things.
6087060	6093380	But unfortunately, I guess the powder actually is it's good by itself, but it really got
6093380	6095620	to have their baked chicken to go with it.
6096260	6098420	You kind of need both to be the cracked chicken.
6098420	6101220	So we'll have to order some more of that this week.
6102260	6102900	Okay.
6102900	6106420	Anyway, I was going to plug the mailbag, at least, even if it was empty.
6106420	6110500	Even if Dark Sakura found churros in it, which is always a pleasant surprise, you can always
6110500	6110980	email us.
6110980	6115940	Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you want to send us an email in a future week.
6115940	6119460	Um, I will get to Discord in a minute, but we do have some Roundtable stuff coming from
6119460	6119700	chat.
6119700	6120500	So let's get to it.
6121060	6124100	No One Special 77 in chat says, Roundtable question.
6124660	6130500	Aside from Magic the Gatherings and Diablo 1 and 2, what games do you know of and would
6130500	6134260	recommend that can be played solely with the left hand?
6134900	6136740	Too long, didn't read version.
6136740	6141620	Since January 23rd, 2021, I can no longer use my right arm.
6141620	6143220	Oh my gosh, I'm sorry to hear that.
6143220	6144820	That explains why you haven't been around in a while.
6144820	6146980	Well, I hope you're feeling okay.
6146980	6147860	I'm really sorry to hear that.
6148500	6151380	So what gaming I can do is limited.
6152020	6153380	Oh, that's a good question.
6154420	6158900	I don't know, Dark Sakura, I know there was a period of time where you were having a lot
6158900	6159460	of wrist.
6160340	6165060	Uh, you'd had surgery on your wrist and so you were kind of doing some one-handed gaming.
6165060	6168900	Um, is there any, I'm sorry to interrupt, uh, churro time, but is there any advice,
6168900	6170500	uh, from your experience in that?
6170500	6173940	Cause I mean, I, I, I haven't been, she was completely different.
6173940	6175300	I could still use my thumb.
6175300	6177060	I know, but weren't you, weren't you still one hand?
6177060	6178100	Oh, you were using your thumb.
6178100	6178420	Okay.
6178420	6178740	All right.
6178740	6182660	I thought you were using, hold on, I'll put it up on, on chat.
6182660	6183940	This is what I use.
6183940	6184900	I game with this too.
6185700	6191300	Um, it's one of the old Microsoft thumb track ball mice, um, that they don't make anymore.
6192100	6200340	But, um, the only thing that I could think of is, um, if there's any mobility with the
6200340	6207140	right arm at all, like any at all, then maybe a top track ball would, would be something
6207140	6207780	that could be used.
6207780	6212420	If not, then they do make those one-handed RPG controllers.
6213300	6217300	Cause I, right after my surgery, I was playing, um, blue dragon with that.
6218340	6223220	Not the, not the toot my own horn or anything, but if you remap some, if you remap the action
6223220	6229300	button in your favorite NES emulator, pixel poops number two is quite playable with one
6229300	6232260	hand because it's just directional and one button.
6232260	6234180	So there you go.
6234180	6236020	And I was, go ahead, Jimmy.
6236980	6242980	On top of that, as we've, uh, we've told no one special in, uh, a while back, there's
6242980	6249300	also, uh, plenty of switch controls now where you can use, uh, head movement or another
6249300	6253220	hand for controlling a game with a single directional switch.
6254180	6261380	Um, so there's plenty, there's tons of adaptive controllers out there from multiple places.
6261940	6270020	Um, my max well, before PCs had it actually had plenty of integrated, uh, accessibility
6270020	6272420	options, uh, for various things.
6273300	6280980	So, well, and I w that's kind of the direction my, you know, I, I have not been in that situation
6280980	6283700	where I only have the one hand for gaming.
6283700	6288580	Um, so it's, it's hard cause I don't, I don't really have experience, but my brain was kind
6288580	6293860	of going to the, well, the good news is that, you know, more and more games have been aware
6293860	6294980	of accessibility.
6294980	6299780	And so sometimes it's just about remapping the games that you want to play, but you might
6299780	6303060	have to rethink, well, I was, I was going to say you might have to rethink where you're
6303060	6307380	playing them because I'm thinking of things like, okay, well, PlayStation four and five
6307380	6308900	have it baked into the OS.
6308900	6313780	You can change buttons for any game, so you can change it around to basically make, you
6313780	6315140	know, just about anything work.
6315780	6319540	You just might have to remap the buttons and you can do that within the actual OS.
6319540	6323940	But since I know no one special from, you know, having been a long time listener, I
6323940	6330260	know that no one special pretty much games like on PC, I think the mouse thing is a great
6330260	6335700	suggestion because, and no one special is saying, um, there's virtually no mobility
6335700	6336660	in the arm.
6336660	6341060	Um, which again, sorry to hear that, but I still think that mouse suggestion about there
6341060	6343460	are games that are completely playable with the mouse.
6343460	6345540	I know you like trading card games.
6345540	6351140	Um, so I would think of other, you know, very mouse focused games like, uh, like hearthstone.
6351140	6354900	I would think even things like civilization, you can play almost completely with the mouse
6354900	6357540	because I know when I've played that game, I've almost played that exclusively with the
6357540	6358180	mouse.
6358180	6362420	A lot of things that were developed with the PC in mind have really taken advantage of
6362420	6362820	the mouse.
6362820	6368100	You might have to get a different mouse, a lefty mouse, but that's, that's pretty common.
6368100	6372900	Um, so there's a, that shouldn't be too, too much of a simple web search.
6373540	6379300	I found one handed controllers among them being a single handed controller for switch.
6380740	6387300	Um, that will, um, uh, I think it's, it's one for switcher.
6387300	6391220	I have to double check it, but I mean, they exist.
6391220	6393380	You just have to look them up.
6394020	6394260	Yeah.
6394980	6400100	Uh, and pod culture and chat says, uh, Adam's friend Justin that was sometimes on pod culture
6400100	6402500	is also limited to, uh, one arm.
6402500	6404900	I'll have to check with what he games with.
6404900	6409620	So I do love the paying it forward there in chat to, uh, get some suggestions from other
6409620	6413220	people who may be going through something similar, uh, in that situation.
6413220	6420020	So, uh, I just found a mini ring, the Bluetooth controller that you play with one hand, one
6420020	6421780	handed Bluetooth wireless controller.
6422420	6425860	Um, there's the PS one ones that you can use an adapter with.
6425860	6430900	There's a Banggood PSDD one, one handed game pad Bluetooth.
6431540	6436420	Um, there is the Logitech adaptive game kit for Xbox controller.
6436420	6439140	There is one that uses rings.
6440900	6447380	There's also a hori makes, uh, what's called the tactical assault commander pro for Xbox
6447380	6450500	one, um, which of course then would work on a PC.
6451060	6457700	Um, but yeah, there, there's a number, a number of controllers out there.
6457700	6461780	ASCII stick, um, for super Famicom, if you want to get into your retro games.
6461780	6464020	So they're out there.
6465300	6465800	All right.
6466500	6470180	Um, I found, uh, a one handed PS four controller.
6471300	6474900	Oh, so yeah, they're out there.
6474900	6478980	It's nice to know at least that there is the more, more and more accessibility, um, you
6478980	6482900	know, and, and options are out there because I feel like if we'd done a search 10, even
6482900	6485540	10 years ago, there wouldn't be as many options.
6485540	6488420	I don't know if we would have found the RPG controllers.
6488980	6489480	Yeah.
6489700	6490020	Yeah.
6490020	6492020	And they were practically giving those away.
6492020	6494260	I have one for like PlayStation and for Dreamcast.
6495940	6496740	Um, okay.
6496740	6499380	Uh, thank you all for the feedback on that question.
6499380	6504340	Let me get to, uh, some of the comments left in our discord over at vognetwork.com slash
6504340	6505860	discord throughout the week.
6505860	6510820	Uh, dungeon buster had, uh, kind of highlighted a story for us that had to do with, uh, EA
6510820	6515700	loot boxes, uh, pulling the quote saying, if you do not buy the pack, you will see the
6515700	6519380	previewed pack remains in the store where it is now on a refresh timer.
6519380	6523860	The timer has to expire before you can preview another pack of the same type.
6523860	6528660	In one example, given by EA, a pack expired in 20 hours and 35 minutes.
6528660	6533540	So this has to do with EA letting you see what is in FIFA loot boxes before you buy
6533540	6533780	them.
6533780	6535540	I think I was reading a story on this somewhere else.
6535540	6540020	It's not all the loot boxes, but it's like limited to certain types or whatever, but
6540020	6540740	it is interesting.
6540740	6543300	I think the EA has been pressured to go this direction.
6543300	6546020	It feels like this took forever for this to happen.
6546020	6550420	Um, so I'm kind of not surprised to see this happening, but I'm definitely glad at least
6550420	6554100	we have a little more knowledge now on, you know, what exactly are you going to be buying?
6554100	6558340	It may, it, it takes some of the gambling notion out of it, even if it is still, uh,
6558340	6560020	randomized, so to speak.
6560020	6560980	So there is that.
6561780	6562100	All right.
6562100	6566180	Um, Ooh, I didn't know this, uh, 13 X forever in chat.
6566500	6566900	Excuse me.
6566900	6572580	And discord said, apparently Sega is doing a physical Sonic card game, uh, linking us
6572580	6576820	to a tweet from the official Sega account at Sega saying, take your sneakers to the
6576820	6581860	tabletop with the brand new game from steam forge available to pre-order now and, uh,
6581860	6584260	giving links to a Sonic card game.
6584260	6585540	Got to play fast, right?
6586340	6588820	Ooh, I remember reading about this story too.
6588820	6593700	So thank you for highlighting for this core K in arch, uh, discord chat, uh, has to do
6593780	6598980	with analog and those pocket, like that game boy color thing that they were making.
6598980	6601620	Uh, they are going to be making more of them.
6601620	6606580	And you might remember that they had, uh, some real issues with bots and, uh, you know,
6606580	6609300	sniping all the, uh, good stuff and all that.
6609300	6614100	They have also talked about analog, uh, that they're going to do robust bot protection.
6614100	6618260	So pocket, uh, had sold out almost instantly.
6618260	6624180	This is a $200 device that plays Neo Geo pocket color, Atari links, Sega game gear, and multiple
6624180	6628180	generations of game boy color color, excuse me, game boy titles, which would, I would
6628180	6629540	assume include color.
6629540	6631220	Um, but nobody could get one.
6631220	6632900	It seems cause all the scalpers got them.
6632900	6635300	So, uh, that's great that it's coming back.
6635300	6638340	Cause I think a lot of people were like, why won't they make more?
6638340	6639220	Well, good news, everyone.
6639220	6642660	They're going to make more, I'm going to guess maybe some of the supply and demand
6642660	6647540	supply issues, mainly with COVID, uh, probably made this really hard for a while.
6647540	6649940	So I'm glad to see it's, um, coming back.
6649940	6650740	So there is that.
6652020	6652580	All right.
6653540	6658900	Uh, if you have some comments throughout the week, uh, vog network.com slash discord is
6658900	6660580	the place to leave those comments.
6660580	6662260	And of course you can always send us an email as well.
6662820	6666500	Participate at orange lounge, radio.com.
6666500	6669540	Um, let me check in with Loki and see if we have any last minute stories.
6670740	6671220	Yeah.
6671220	6676260	So I was going to talk about, there was a leak, uh, showing a brand new Lego Mario set.
6676260	6679300	That's a massive Bowser airship.
6679300	6684740	So I'm assuming I know where this is going to be coming from, that they're going to,
6684740	6688740	this is going to be an announcement that's going to happen next weekend because they're
6688740	6693220	doing their first ever Lego con, which is kind of like this virtual convention.
6693220	6696020	And they're supposed to be announcing more Lego Mario sets there.
6696020	6704580	So, um, my guess is that leaked out somewhere, but, uh, oh, well, I guess we'll see it then.
6704580	6707140	Um, but yeah, it looks pretty cool.
6707140	6713860	It's got over a thousand pieces in it and it's got a, uh, Kamek in there and yeah,
6713860	6715300	the ship is pretty large as well.
6715300	6716740	So, well, you know what though?
6716740	6721860	Sometimes things leak from companies before big conventions and they still don't materialize.
6721860	6724660	I E the Simpsons arcade one up cabinet.
6724660	6726340	What the hell happened there?
6726340	6730740	Like I want, I want an airship the size of the USS flag though.
6730740	6733380	The GI Joe playset.
6734660	6735140	Oh yeah.
6735140	6735700	Yeah.
6735700	6735940	Yeah.
6735940	6736580	I love that.
6736580	6738020	Well, I know people who have them.
6739380	6742420	The closest you can get to that, I mean, would be, it's not there.
6742420	6747300	Well, I mean, it's the, uh, Marvel Avengers airship that they had was pretty large,
6747300	6748740	but it was micro scale.
6748740	6752420	I want a mini fixed scale one, but that would be like the size of my kitchen table.
6752420	6753220	So yeah.
6753220	6755380	Well, the flag would be the size of your kitchen table.
6755380	6756980	So that's true.
6756980	6757620	Yeah.
6757620	6757860	Yeah.
6758420	6762020	Um, man, I miss when they made toy sets that big.
6764340	6764580	Yeah.
6765540	6766100	All right.
6766100	6767220	Any other last minute stories?
6768020	6769140	Uh, no, that's all I had.
6769780	6770260	All right.
6770820	6773860	Well, I think we're, uh, it's a little shorter tonight, but that's all right.
6773860	6775540	We're going to get to some final thoughts.
6775540	6778420	It's kind of like you had those E3 announcements and then, okay.
6778420	6781540	Everybody's taking a break from news cause everything kind of came out at once,
6781540	6784740	but I'm sure we'll start to see more and more pickup in the coming weeks.
6784740	6787140	Um, so of course, uh, before we get to the final thoughts,
6787220	6790020	I do want to thank everybody out there for listening to orange launch radio.
6790020	6791780	Thank you for participating with our show.
6791780	6794020	Um, your support really means a lot to us.
6794020	6797700	Um, if you enjoyed what you heard here at orange launch radio, please tell a friend or two.
6797700	6800580	Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice,
6800580	6805140	but if the voices aren't here to put out on air, then we were missing the voices.
6805140	6807140	So, uh, yeah, tell a friend or two about the show.
6807140	6810580	Uh, a nice five star review on a site like iTunes goes a real long way.
6810580	6812980	Um, or wherever it is you found this podcast.
6813300	6817620	Also, um, the, the hosting, uh, on Twitch for VOG network is huge.
6817620	6819620	I really thank everybody that does that.
6819620	6820900	Um, thank you. Thank you.
6820900	6822580	Uh, appreciate all that support.
6822580	6824980	Um, and even if you're, even if you're just here,
6824980	6828420	listening to the podcast feed, uh, Monday morning at work, you know what?
6828420	6829940	I appreciate you being here too.
6829940	6830900	Uh, we all do.
6830900	6833460	And thank you, uh, for being a part of the show.
6833460	6836260	Email us or tweet us sometimes and we know you're out there or join the discord
6836260	6836740	or something like that.
6836740	6837460	I don't know.
6837460	6837940	Anyway.
6837940	6840100	Um, that's all I can think of.
6840100	6843300	Another plug for the shop, uh, that was updated with lots and lots of good stuff
6843300	6846420	this week, uh, including a fanny pack, vog network.com.
6846420	6848260	It's the, it's the must have vog item of the year.
6848260	6852100	The fanny pack, vog network.com slash shop for that.
6852100	6853700	I'll have to put up a few others.
6855140	6855620	Well, yeah.
6855620	6860500	And we are kind of watching what sells and what doesn't because we're only allowed to
6860500	6862660	list, I think 25 things at a time.
6862660	6864340	So like those are we, ha ha.
6864340	6864500	Yeah.
6864500	6864740	Yeah.
6864740	6869060	So we got to, it can't go too buck wild, but like, I think the mat, the masks are
6869060	6872900	now gone because, um, they weren't very good, unfortunately.
6872900	6875220	So that is, but the mugs, the mugs are great.
6875220	6876260	The shirts are great.
6876260	6878660	Like everything else that's come from that store has been really good.
6878660	6885860	So I put some more tank tops up instead of like just regular t-shirts cause tank tops.
6885860	6886100	Yeah.
6886740	6886980	Yeah.
6886980	6887620	You know?
6887620	6888100	Yeah.
6888100	6892020	Um, but I thought that people might like want a notebook or something.
6894100	6896340	So, and the stickers are actually really good quality.
6896340	6897940	I ordered some of my own stickers.
6899140	6906100	And like, I mean, I can show you as well for those on in chat right now, I can show an
6906100	6908580	example of just like how good the printing is on them.
6909460	6911860	So, I mean, I'll, I'll hide that.
6911860	6916340	So I'm not doing like cross promotion, but I mean, they're really nice and good quality.
6917060	6918740	You're allowed to promote your own stream on it.
6918740	6918980	Okay.
6918980	6920900	Well then look, come on.
6920900	6924180	Well, I just don't want to, you know, ruffle any feathers.
6924900	6925700	Fine.
6925700	6926260	Oh my God.
6926260	6927700	My feathers are so rough.
6929060	6934340	Well, but anyway, but as you can see, they're really thick and they're the cutout style
6934340	6934660	ones.
6934660	6939380	So it's like they have the little pull out pieces.
6939380	6941140	Oh, I didn't know that.
6941140	6941780	That's cool.
6941780	6949220	So yeah, so if you have any like open space, like of a certain gap, then, um, it'll be
6949220	6950100	hollow in the center.
6950820	6951300	That's nice.
6952100	6952500	Yeah.
6952500	6954740	They're really, they're really good quality stickers.
6954740	6956820	I think they're the kinds that you can put on like water bottles.
6959380	6959860	All right.
6960580	6960900	Awesome.
6960900	6961380	Awesome.
6961380	6962260	I was trying to load up.
6962260	6967300	I may not, I may not have it, uh, right away because, um, the Twitch panel doesn't show
6967300	6969060	me those purchases.
6969060	6972500	I only see that when I'm logged into stream labs, which I didn't have the foresight to
6972500	6973220	do tonight.
6973220	6976580	So I may not be able to thank you all tonight, but I'll try to do that next week.
6976580	6980580	Like thank everybody who's, uh, uh, checked out some, I have seen, it does scroll along
6980580	6981060	the bottom.
6981060	6985060	If you buy it during OLR, you actually scrolls along the bottom and shows that you did that.
6985060	6985620	So thank you.
6985620	6986500	Thank you for that.
6986500	6988580	Uh, everybody that is supporting so far.
6988820	6993540	You don't have to, but, um, you know, you guys do ask, can I get an OLR shirt?
6993540	6997140	So, um, it, it's only been like 19 years, but yes, you may.
6997140	6998580	You may have an OLR shirt.
6998580	7002580	No, we ha we did have others, but you know, this is the first like big one that we've
7002580	7002820	done.
7002820	7005700	That's a print on demand too, which is really nice.
7005700	7011460	So, oh, and I wanted just to kind of do something a little bit different cause I don't think
7011460	7017620	we actually have an official orange lounge radio logo, which we need to get on.
7018580	7020340	Other than that thing.
7020900	7024900	I don't, I don't really consider that cause that was made by my ex that I haven't talked
7024900	7026740	to in like how many years.
7026740	7028100	Um, I, I like it.
7028100	7030580	I'm still mad at him for the editing on those pictures.
7030580	7030820	Okay.
7032580	7035380	We're going to talk about that during the episode one stream this week.
7035380	7035620	Okay.
7037860	7040980	So, uh, he, was he on that episode?
7041540	7044020	Shitty might've been, God, I hope I don't have to hear him.
7044020	7044260	All right.
7044260	7046020	No, I'm just, I don't, I'm not that bitter.
7046740	7052420	But I was, um, thinking of, uh, you know, just like maybe the Sega font was fun.
7052420	7053300	So I did that.
7053300	7059620	And then, um, I was kind of influenced by that whole kind of eighties retro thing going
7059620	7060260	around right now.
7060260	7062020	So I did one for VOG that way.
7062020	7062420	Yeah.
7062420	7066580	Um, I know Bobby was really thrilled with that VOG network logo and I like it too that
7066580	7069220	what I wasn't ex I guess I wasn't expecting that.
7069220	7074180	So I would kind of file that in the things I didn't know I needed until I saw it Ben.
7074180	7075300	So congrats.
7075300	7079940	I might have to, well, and I'll tell you actually what started that was the design
7079940	7082180	was my branding for, for mine.
7082180	7085540	Cause mine's all like neon and everything.
7085540	7088900	And I was like, I want to do something for VOG, but I want it to look different.
7089860	7092020	And I think I succeeded.
7092020	7097220	Um, SSJ100Matt in chat says kind of want that album art thing so I can get it signed
7097220	7097940	from y'all.
7097940	7101220	Then again, that sounds weird getting something signed by friends.
7101220	7104020	Oh, that's, but that's really sweet that you would want something like that.
7104020	7106820	So I'd be happy to sign anything anytime.
7107620	7108900	It's a little pricey though.
7108900	7109620	Isn't it?
7109620	7110420	The canvas one.
7111300	7118340	I just put it up, I put it up as a whim and gosh, if y'all like it, then, then I'll
7118340	7118900	keep it up.
7119460	7119960	Yeah.
7120980	7121460	All right.
7121460	7122820	Yeah, it's funny in chat.
7122820	7123380	No one's special.
7123380	7126420	Say anyone born on the day or started is now college age.
7126420	7127140	Funny you should say that.
7127140	7130660	I was listening to a couple of folks, um, their podcasts actually.
7130660	7135460	And they were talking about how, um, how they got started kind of in making videos
7135460	7136340	on YouTube and stuff.
7136340	7137540	And they were talking about, Oh yeah.
7137540	7142260	You know, we used to watch all these videos and stuff when we were like seven and this,
7142260	7142900	you know, date.
7142900	7144740	I'm like, Oh my God.
7144740	7147220	Like we started recording.
7148500	7151060	Some of my streamer friends, I'm just like, y'all are babies.
7152100	7153620	Some are babies.
7153620	7157620	It's really one of the, since we had an, we're only at two hours for the show.
7157620	7160100	I'm going to allow super tangent train tonight.
7160820	7166900	So because, um, like I, I didn't have YouTube when I was a teenager, but I got into pub
7166900	7167860	public access.
7167860	7168820	You guys know this.
7169460	7172420	I actually had like a sketch comedy show I did with a friend of mine.
7172420	7174820	Everybody always asks, can we see the tapes?
7174820	7175620	Can we see the tape?
7175620	7180020	Can we do the, uh, the high spectrum, uh, airing as a channel point reward?
7180020	7185460	And the answer is no, I, and it's not because I don't want to, although it is also because
7185460	7188100	I don't want to, but I, I literally don't know where the tapes are.
7188100	7189300	They are tapes.
7189300	7190020	They're that old.
7190020	7191540	They're on VHS somewhere.
7191540	7193860	I don't even know how we, I have to send them to Bobby to play.
7193860	7194820	Cause I don't even have it.
7194820	7200580	But I, number one, I, I, if you, if you think episode one is aged poorly, you should see
7200580	7202420	my show from 1996.
7202420	7202740	Okay.
7202740	7204500	That's aged really poorly.
7204500	7210740	Uh, and yeah, I don't, if you can get me a tape based camcorder or something, I can
7210740	7211460	rip it easily.
7211460	7213860	I've got the, the software for it.
7213860	7215940	I, I, I literally don't, I don't have the taste.
7216180	7222740	I would have to reach out to my former co-host and she lives in SoCal now.
7222740	7224180	We're, we're, we're cordial.
7224180	7229060	I, I, you know, she, she was the world to me when I was in high school and those earlier
7229060	7232580	years, but we've just, you know, life sometimes takes you in separate directions and, you
7232580	7236580	know, she's, uh, she's raising her family in Southern California, but we do keep in
7236580	7237700	touch on Instagram.
7237700	7240900	So I do see, I see her kids growing up on my Instagram feed.
7240900	7243380	So there is that she has twins actually.
7243380	7244740	So, uh, yeah.
7245220	7250180	Um, but anyway, uh, so SSJ100Matt says, Travis has those tapes.
7250980	7253780	Travis does not have those tapes.
7253780	7256420	What Travis has or had.
7257140	7259780	So he used to play this on under station live all the time.
7259780	7261380	He did it.
7261380	7266340	What he played on his show was a lot like the public access show, but that whole thing
7266340	7270980	would like the, the onyx where I was playing like a jewel type character, but I was onyx
7270980	7271940	get it, haha.
7271940	7277060	And other, because Shannon, who I used to do the show with back in the day, her and
7277060	7281060	I went to the same college and we were in the same summer school class and we were in
7281060	7284100	the same group to make this project.
7284100	7287700	So there was a lot of influence from what we had done on our public access show that
7287700	7288820	was in this project.
7288820	7292580	So basically that whole thing that was, I don't even remember what the hell it was now.
7292580	7294180	You guys have seen it more than I have.
7294180	7298420	Uh, but I think, Oh, was that the whole, it's Holanda or something like that.
7298420	7301380	Like we did, it's a whole talk show thing.
7301380	7306820	And, um, it was, it was very similar to what the would have been on the sketch comedy show
7306820	7308260	that we did on public access.
7308260	7314100	So that is, is kind of what it is, but technically that tape is not the public access show.
7314100	7318660	That is the college project because he probably also has the spice girls music video that
7318660	7319140	we did.
7319940	7322980	Cause like we had two big projects in the summer class.
7322980	7324660	One was to make a documentary.
7324660	7325780	That's what it was documentary.
7325780	7327220	And we made a funny one.
7327220	7334340	And then, uh, the other was to make a, um, music video and he has that, but he does not
7334340	7339060	have my old, uh, he he's been trying to find him, but if Shannon doesn't have the tapes,
7339060	7340260	then they're gone.
7340260	7343700	I don't know where they are because Roseville doesn't even have public access anymore.
7343700	7347860	They might've folded it into the government access channel there.
7347860	7352100	So they might have the tapes in an archive somewhere, but I would be very surprised.
7352100	7353780	I'd be very, very surprised.
7353860	7355060	So, um,
7355060	7360660	I just have to use the freedom of information act to find it in hell.
7362180	7364020	No, that show is not getting out.
7364020	7370260	SSJ 100 Matt says if it's PBS, no different, uh, public access and PBS are very different.
7370260	7376500	PBS is like the, the, the, the, the BBC of the U S it's the government funded, uh, channel
7376500	7377380	that's in every market.
7377380	7379940	Public access is local television.
7379940	7384420	So I had this show, but only people in the Sacramento suburb of Roseville could see it
7384420	7386340	because it was on Roseville public access.
7386340	7387460	So what city?
7387460	7395540	I think that if you go, there's like a city of Roseville TV and it's the government access
7395540	7401140	one that there's, I think a, a request thing through them.
7401140	7402020	So interesting.
7402020	7406980	I could look into it, but so channel eight was public access and channel 11 was government
7406980	7407380	access.
7407380	7408740	So yeah, Wayne's world.
7408740	7410020	I'm not, yes, wait.
7410020	7410260	Yeah.
7410260	7413060	Wayne's world actually is not that far off.
7413060	7415300	I mean of the concept, right?
7415300	7417540	Cause Wayne's world was a rift on public access shows.
7417540	7418660	It really was.
7418660	7422980	Um, but I think the, like, like you kind of said, the government access, they were all
7422980	7428580	about, they air city council meetings, they air, um, you know, uh, government at work
7428580	7428820	stuff.
7428820	7432820	It's um, C-SPAN for local stuff.
7432820	7433540	That's what they do.
7433540	7437140	So 11 and eight didn't really cross paths ever.
7437140	7441780	But I'm thinking if they closed eight because they had to have, cause of YouTube, anything
7441780	7444020	they had, I would imagine folded into 11.
7444660	7447940	But yeah, uh, no one special hit the nail on the head here.
7447940	7452260	Public access channels were the pre-internet version of Twitch or YouTube.
7452260	7453620	That's exactly it.
7453620	7458100	So I wasn't on YouTube, but I, I did public access instead.
7458100	7463220	And that was, that was interesting, you know, cause it was on TV.
7463220	7466980	And so there'd be people that I would meet at Rocky Horror that would be like, I
7466980	7469140	saw you on TV like two years ago.
7469140	7470500	Your show was weird.
7472100	7473140	Yeah, it is.
7473140	7473540	It was.
7474340	7476260	So anyway, all right.
7476260	7477300	That was a walk down memory lane.
7477300	7479540	Any other tangents we want to do before we close up shop tonight?
7480420	7486020	Um, I'm just gonna do, have some fun with Debbie Delight after the show.
7486020	7486980	Good times.
7486980	7487700	Good times.
7489300	7493700	You don't have to rape me if you don't want to, but I'll be there.
7494420	7495380	All right.
7495460	7497780	Over at, uh, dark soccer, OLR.
7497780	7502180	So underscore underscore, the underscore is very important.
7502740	7504020	Um, okay.
7504660	7507780	That's, uh, that's going to do it for the show tonight.
7507780	7509860	Um, thank you guys so much for watching us.
7509860	7510980	I appreciate that.
7510980	7514580	Um, and, uh, that's, that's it.
7514580	7517540	Uh, I think I already said all the closing stuff and then we got into the tangents.
7517540	7518500	Oh, final thoughts.
7518500	7521620	I didn't really properly collect final thoughts.
7521620	7524340	So, um, Loki, why don't we start with you your final thought tonight?
7524900	7529540	Final thought is, uh, if you haven't yet, go, go watch my newest video that I have on
7529540	7535060	my YouTube channel, which is, uh, under user at Logilr and, uh, go leave it a like.
7535700	7536660	Subscribe if you haven't.
7538580	7541300	Um, my final thought is it's a big week next week.
7541300	7542900	Uh, my birthday is on the weekend.
7542900	7545700	I'm looking forward to that and actually getting to do something this year.
7545700	7550740	Um, and then, uh, I also OLR's birthday, so, um, we'll get into it a little more next
7550740	7554740	week, which will be kind of like our official 19th, uh, year celebration, I suppose.
7554740	7558500	Um, but just, you know, big thanks you guys just showing up.
7558500	7559140	It means a lot.
7559140	7562100	And I just really thank you guys for being here, whether you've been here for 19 minutes
7562100	7563940	or you've been here for all 19 years.
7563940	7565140	Um, you're awesome.
7565140	7566740	And thank you so much for being a part of it.
7566740	7568180	Uh, last but not least our soccer.
7569300	7573780	Uh, just two little things, not to be a downer, but this is the first father's day I've spent
7573780	7574820	since my dad died.
7574820	7577540	So if I'm in a mood, that's why.
7578500	7583780	Um, and second of all, um, the matchmaking and dead by daylight is fucking broken as
7583780	7584020	fuck.
7584020	7586180	And I'm getting sick of the toxic little campers.
7586820	7589300	That's I, I want that MMR thing back.
7589300	7590260	It was so much better.
7590900	7591220	Right.
7591220	7593780	The MMR was beautiful.
7593780	7594100	Yeah.
7594100	7595460	I hope that goes back.
7595460	7599860	Oh, and I also have a tick tock now where you can hear me complain about what about
7599860	7604020	being a survivor on a, uh, bot controlled survivor game.
7604020	7605460	How do you start a tick tack?
7605460	7607620	I'm, I'm on the tick tack and I don't know how to use it.
7608180	7610260	Well, I just uploaded my own videos.
7611220	7617940	Um, but, uh, I recorded a video on my phone of Midna and a little outside cat.
7618820	7623380	And, um, I just kind of played around with the video.
7623380	7627540	I uploaded the video and then added some effects to it and boom, I had a ticky tocky.
7628180	7629220	I have a tick tack.
7629220	7630820	I don't remember if I'm Rob Roberts or Mr.
7630820	7631300	Rob Roberts.
7632260	7637940	And all I have is a video from Rocky horror back in like 2019 where I dressed up.
7637940	7640740	My Halloween costume was a PG and E executive.
7640740	7643780	And so I was walking around in a suit and tie holding a power cord.
7643780	7646340	Cause the joke was I turned off all the power anyway.
7646340	7647620	And that was my one tick tock.
7647620	7651620	But I noticed like hundreds of people viewed it and I'm like, why?
7651620	7652900	This is stupid.
7652900	7654260	So it is interesting.
7654260	7657060	My funniest one that says only four people looked at it.
7657060	7659540	What I'm sure I've linked it to more people than that.
7659540	7661860	So maybe it just takes a while.
7661860	7667780	I also though took one of my, um, one of my clips from, uh, playing dead by daylight.
7667780	7672740	And I put it to music with an intro from just in playing in final cut pro.
7673380	7676420	And it's, uh, Amanda young, how to catch a husband.
7676420	7677780	And it's her putting David on a hook.
7679460	7679960	Love that.
7680900	7681460	All right.
7681460	7683140	Uh, that's going to do it.
7683140	7684100	Have a good week, everybody.
7684100	7686180	We'll see you next time here at orange launch radio.
7686180	7686980	Have a great week.
7686980	7689620	We'll see you next week for our 19th birthday.
7689620	7694740	And hopefully some of you on Wednesday as well for the super fun cringe episode one
7694740	7695380	listen through.
7695380	7696900	So, uh, happy gaming.
7696900	7697620	Have fun.
7697620	7699460	Uh, don't be one of those jerks online.
7699460	7700180	Be nice.
7700180	7700680	Bye.
